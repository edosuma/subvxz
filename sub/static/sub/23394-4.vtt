WEBVTT

00:01.960 --> 00:05.419
There was a young street
urchin killed up on the bridge.

00:05.547 --> 00:08.290
Does this have
something to do with Willem?

00:10.385 --> 00:12.172
Why would he willingly go
to his death?

00:12.304 --> 00:14.170
Because he went with someone
he trusted.

00:14.306 --> 00:16.889
What was his name?
The one with the silver smile?

00:18.018 --> 00:20.180
Heights.
He's attracted to heights.

00:21.146 --> 00:23.980
Ask yourself why you seek
the companionship of strangers.

00:24.107 --> 00:27.646
Miss Howard, how did you cope
with your father's suicide?

00:28.237 --> 00:29.853
Kreizler, that's quite enough!

01:09.111 --> 01:11.478
Are you not satisfied
with my progress, doctor,

01:11.613 --> 01:13.275
that you had to check up on me?

01:14.241 --> 01:16.858
I'm here today
as your pupil, madam.

01:16.994 --> 01:20.237
I didn't know
you had the imagination.

01:20.372 --> 01:21.372
Please.

01:40.809 --> 01:42.516
He's a foreman
at the brewery.

01:42.644 --> 01:44.806
Quite used to giving orders.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.180
In here,
he prefers taking them.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.817
I've moved on from torturing
helpless creatures.

01:53.947 --> 01:56.690
I need your insight
into someone.

01:56.825 --> 02:00.660
Someone whose behavior you may
be more familiar with than I.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.575
And what is his or her
particular predilection?

02:04.583 --> 02:06.825
Inflicting pain.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.795
You see these butterflies?

02:19.264 --> 02:23.634
Beneath their beautiful wings
is a whole array of instruments

02:23.769 --> 02:28.434
used to inflict agony
during coitus.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.187
The connection
between pain and pleasure

02:32.319 --> 02:34.811
is far more common
than you think.

02:34.946 --> 02:37.484
The person I'm speaking of
is certainly not common.

02:37.616 --> 02:40.950
For one thing, I suspect he's
aroused by the sight of blood.

02:41.078 --> 02:43.240
If I counted
the number of times

02:43.372 --> 02:44.988
I've brought a prick
to attention

02:45.123 --> 02:46.659
by drawing a drop of blood...

02:46.792 --> 02:49.455
I'm not talking about
a drop of blood,

02:49.586 --> 02:51.794
rather the act of
mutilation and stabbing.

02:52.839 --> 02:56.003
The mind is the most erotic
organ of the body, Doctor.

02:56.134 --> 02:58.171
Isn't that your domain?

02:59.346 --> 03:03.306
In my experience, the man
who enjoys defiling women

03:03.433 --> 03:06.517
is usually dominated
in his daily life,

03:06.645 --> 03:10.810
while the man who enjoys being
beaten is probably a bully.

03:10.941 --> 03:12.477
Take yourself.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.101
With all your intelligence,
you're most likely aroused

03:15.237 --> 03:17.900
by someone for whom that
intelligence means nothing.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.611
Is that what he's looking for
in his victims?

03:24.746 --> 03:25.953
The opposite?

03:27.499 --> 03:31.834
Of all the stories I told you
when I was your patient...

03:33.255 --> 03:36.839
...which ones wormed their way
into your mind,

03:36.967 --> 03:39.084
kept you up at night?

03:40.220 --> 03:42.883
Oh, come, Doctor.

03:43.014 --> 03:46.007
I don't believe you were
completely unmoved.

03:48.770 --> 03:53.481
I found your accounts
of men's vulnerabilities

03:53.608 --> 03:55.224
in particular interesting.

03:56.153 --> 03:59.271
My "accounts
of men's vulnerabilities"?

04:00.407 --> 04:03.946
I recognized my own weakness,
and it gave me pleasure.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.989
Then there's your answer.

04:06.121 --> 04:08.864
If your friend
enjoys inflicting wounds,

04:08.999 --> 04:13.744
there's a good chance
he has wounds of his own.

04:13.879 --> 04:15.495
The cripple in him

04:15.630 --> 04:20.375
is looking for the cripple
in another.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.298
Forgive me, madam.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.141
Thank you for your help.

05:07.557 --> 05:08.557
Commissioner Roosevelt!

05:12.103 --> 05:13.310
He's here.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.819
- Hyah!
- Commissioner Roosevelt!

05:22.948 --> 05:23.864
Commissioner!

05:23.865 --> 05:26.152
- Sir? Sir!
- Commissioner Roosevelt.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.991
Commissioner Roosevelt!

05:28.119 --> 05:29.639
Have you anything to say
about the fact

05:29.746 --> 05:31.066
the dead boys
were all immigrants?

05:31.122 --> 05:32.642
There's rumors
that you interfered

05:32.666 --> 05:35.079
with the investigation
by your own police department?

05:35.210 --> 05:37.497
Commissioner, can you
be trusted to protect the poor,

05:37.629 --> 05:38.961
or just the elite?

05:39.089 --> 05:40.650
Is it true the dead boy
was dressed as a girl?

05:40.674 --> 05:41.901
This is the second one,
isn't it, sir?!

05:41.925 --> 05:42.925
- Stay back!
- Get back!

05:43.009 --> 05:45.092
The people deserve to know!

06:13.415 --> 06:15.077
Just a moment.
I'll connect you.

06:16.793 --> 06:20.377
Might I have a word with
the commissioner, Miss Howard?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.000
Commissioner.

06:26.136 --> 06:29.629
Captain Connor
would like a word.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.677
You might want to stay
for this, Miss Howard.

06:32.809 --> 06:34.471
Sir, I just wanted to share

06:34.603 --> 06:36.515
a new piece of evidence
that's come to light.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.138
It concerns
these terrible boy-whore...

06:39.274 --> 06:41.732
excuse me, child murders.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.702
Took me a moment to know
what I was looking at.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.314
Thought maybe it was a lady's
pocketbook or something.

06:48.450 --> 06:54.447
But, uh, then I opened it up,
and I seen these pictures.

06:55.624 --> 06:56.740
Little dead boys.

06:58.043 --> 07:01.957
It was then that I noticed
these here initials.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.171
J.S.M.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.291
Hmm.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.964
Can't figure it out
for the life of me.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.552
I thought maybe you'd get
a team of your best detectives

07:17.687 --> 07:19.474
to work on it straightaway.

07:22.692 --> 07:26.811
Maybe them smart Jewish boys
could have a go.

07:26.947 --> 07:30.440
Morning, Commissioner.
Miss Howard.

07:51.346 --> 07:52.757
Here, I found another one.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.347
How far down do they go?

07:55.475 --> 07:56.511
Um...

07:58.103 --> 07:59.219
It appears they go

07:59.354 --> 08:00.765
all the way to the ground.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.517
What do you think made these?

08:14.786 --> 08:16.368
Lucius.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.247
It's a piton.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.542
It fits.

08:30.385 --> 08:33.173
It would appear our killer
is a climber.

09:03.543 --> 09:04.579
Miss Howard?

09:05.670 --> 09:06.911
Hello.

09:07.047 --> 09:08.913
I'm looking for the doctor.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.665
He's not at the institute.

09:10.800 --> 09:11.800
Uh, no, ma'am.

09:11.885 --> 09:15.970
He's off in one of his, uh,
trances.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.033

09:40.538 --> 09:43.155
It's John's drawing kit.

09:43.291 --> 09:46.250

- Captain Connor.

09:46.377 --> 09:47.743
Moore said nothing
about this.

09:47.879 --> 09:49.962
Must have lost it
at Castle Garden that night.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.592
Won't you sit down?

09:53.635 --> 09:55.501
I was sent on an errand,
no more.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.219
Miss Howard?

10:00.391 --> 10:02.007
I wonder if you've
given any more thought

10:02.143 --> 10:03.350
to our last conversation.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.437
I don't believe I have it in me
to kill a child.

10:06.564 --> 10:08.897
You might surprise yourself.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.438
Please.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.937
Sit down.

10:28.753 --> 10:30.210
Do you see that woman there?

10:30.338 --> 10:31.338
Yes.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.672
She's from a good family.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.918
She was soon married and quickly
gave birth to a boy,

10:37.053 --> 10:39.420
and a year later, a girl.

10:40.557 --> 10:42.344
If the purpose of this story
is to annoy me,

10:42.475 --> 10:43.761
then you've succeeded.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.385
The purpose is to make the point
she's quite similar to you.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.081
With the not-so-subtle
distinction being

10:48.148 --> 10:50.606
that she's married
and has children.

10:50.733 --> 10:53.441
She had children.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.153
It was six months after
the birth of her daughter,

10:56.281 --> 10:59.069
in a seemingly inexplicable act,

10:59.200 --> 11:01.112
that the young woman saw fit
to submerge

11:01.244 --> 11:05.363
both her children in a bathtub
until they were drowned.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.168
Owing to the wealth
and influence of her family,

11:11.296 --> 11:14.539
she was spared from being sent
to prison or an institution.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.417
However,
instead of proper treatment,

11:17.552 --> 11:22.468
she now walks the park daily,
pushing an empty perambulator.

11:28.146 --> 11:30.012
I can find no empathy
for a mother

11:30.148 --> 11:32.811
who would take the life
of her own children.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.302
But you understand
the expectations

11:34.402 --> 11:36.769
that our society
bestows on women.

11:37.906 --> 11:40.990
To marry.
To have children.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.951
To smile when you feel
incapable of smiling.

11:47.624 --> 11:50.162
If you can empathize with that,
you know better than most

11:50.293 --> 11:52.330
that that poor young woman

11:52.462 --> 11:57.503
with an empty baby carriage
did not form herself.

11:57.634 --> 11:59.170
Rather, society formed her.

12:03.306 --> 12:04.638
You say
you cannot see the world

12:04.766 --> 12:06.348
from the perspective
of a child killer

12:06.476 --> 12:09.264
because you could
never kill a child.

12:10.521 --> 12:13.764
I believe we all possess
the raw material required

12:13.900 --> 12:15.311
to commit horrible acts.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.526
We just need the right
or wrong combination of events

12:17.654 --> 12:19.395
to make
the raw material combustible.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.700
I'm afraid
I must be on my way.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.537
Good day.

Let's not fight.

14:49.806 --> 14:51.593
What?

14:51.724 --> 14:53.886
Welcome to the Golden Rule.

14:57.105 --> 14:58.767
The commissioner shut it down

14:58.898 --> 15:01.060
as soon as we found
the boy's identity.

15:01.192 --> 15:03.149
It's disheartening to think

15:03.277 --> 15:04.984
they live in squalor like this.

15:05.113 --> 15:07.526
Oi,
can't you read?

15:07.657 --> 15:09.489
We're closed.

15:11.285 --> 15:13.652
- We're here on police business.
- Let me see your badges.

15:13.788 --> 15:15.766
Perhaps you'd like to see
the inside of 300 Mulberry?

15:15.790 --> 15:18.328
You know, I've told you people
all I know.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.291
The dead kid was sold to me
by his father

15:20.420 --> 15:22.036
to pay off a gambling debt.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.662
He's just another kid
off the boat.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.835
From where, I don't know.

15:25.967 --> 15:28.300
He was from Syria.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.920
His name was Ali ibn-Ghazi.

15:31.806 --> 15:34.014
Is there a room
with outside access?

15:34.142 --> 15:36.179
One with windows?

15:36.310 --> 15:37.596
This is a basement.

15:37.728 --> 15:40.516
You do know what
a basement is, don't you?

15:45.194 --> 15:46.651
Detective Sergeant?

15:55.913 --> 15:57.449
Did the boy
use this room?

15:59.292 --> 16:01.329
They all use it.

16:34.619 --> 16:36.736
Mr. Moore!
Our man was here, all right.

16:36.871 --> 16:39.909
We found similar evidence
at Castle Gardens.

16:40.041 --> 16:42.784
Hemp strands.
From a rope, I'd surmise.

16:42.919 --> 16:45.127
I don't see any piton holes,
but...

16:46.130 --> 16:50.249
Looks like he tied to this base
and went down the shaft.

17:08.611 --> 17:10.944
Up high,
he can act with the confidence

17:11.071 --> 17:12.813
of the devil himself.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.906
Not the devil.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.444
God.

17:18.538 --> 17:19.699
He's a saint.

17:23.960 --> 17:26.167
Who are you?

17:26.295 --> 17:28.127
They call me Bernadette.

17:31.008 --> 17:32.795
What's your real name?

17:39.517 --> 17:40.517
Joseph.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.888
Joseph.
What are you doing here?

17:43.020 --> 17:44.682
Well, I used to
work downstairs.

17:44.814 --> 17:48.057
You ever see anybody
on that roof over there?

17:48.192 --> 17:49.683
Just the pigeon man.

17:52.613 --> 17:55.356
I'm gonna go downstairs,
see what else I can find out.

17:59.120 --> 18:00.736
You said somebody's a saint.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.737
Who?

18:05.084 --> 18:06.541
A customer.

18:06.669 --> 18:09.252
Fatima called him that.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.496
Who's Fatima?

18:10.631 --> 18:12.748
Ali.

18:12.883 --> 18:14.590
Ali ibn-Ghazi.

18:14.719 --> 18:16.210
We were friends.

18:16.345 --> 18:19.463
That is, until she...

18:22.018 --> 18:24.180
Did you ever see this saint?

18:25.354 --> 18:27.971
See his teeth?
Were they silver?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.941
I never seen any of him,
but...

18:31.068 --> 18:33.685
I know he's real.
Fatima said so.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.437
Why did you call him
a saint?

18:38.618 --> 18:40.178
Because he said he was
gonna take her away

18:40.202 --> 18:42.364
to live up in a castle.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.863
A castle in the sky,
she said.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.377
Hold still.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.507
If you ever see this man,

19:03.643 --> 19:06.135
or someone
with a silver smile...

19:07.438 --> 19:08.804
...don't go with him.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.894
Trust me, Joseph.
Come see me.

19:28.876 --> 19:31.163
I don't know where this
saint is, but he sure as hell

19:31.295 --> 19:34.038
doesn't use wings to get
up and down these buildings.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.799
On the house.

19:50.189 --> 19:54.183
Here he comes. Attaboy.
Yeah, that's it.

19:59.699 --> 20:01.531
You best not let Roosevelt
catch you

20:01.659 --> 20:03.651
drinking your lunch,
Captain.

20:03.786 --> 20:06.403
He'll have your badge for it.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.996
Pious prick.

20:11.001 --> 20:13.869
So, tell me,
what do you want to done

20:14.004 --> 20:15.666
about this society pervert?

20:15.798 --> 20:17.790
Nothing.

20:17.925 --> 20:19.917
Yet.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.839
Just keep an eye on him.

20:23.055 --> 20:24.921
Easy enough.

20:28.894 --> 20:30.851
It's that mother
I don't trust.

20:30.980 --> 20:33.188
If she can't find a place to
stash him

20:33.315 --> 20:34.977
where he can't cut up kids,

20:35.109 --> 20:37.442
someone's gonna have to
do it for her.

20:37.570 --> 20:41.063
There's only one thing
I hate more than a sodomite.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.952
It's a rich sodomite.

20:56.797 --> 20:58.754
Good afternoon, Mrs. Van Bergen.

20:58.883 --> 21:01.045
Yes, Mr. Byrnes?

21:01.177 --> 21:03.260
There's been another incident.

21:04.346 --> 21:05.346
I wouldn't know.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.260
Another boy's been murdered.

21:07.391 --> 21:10.008
There's concern
among certain circles.

21:10.144 --> 21:13.854
I think it necessary
that arrangements be made.

21:13.981 --> 21:16.394
In the best interest
of your son, of course.

21:17.693 --> 21:20.561
I'm not certain what you mean.

21:21.989 --> 21:24.402
Given his history
and his inclinations,

21:24.533 --> 21:28.573
it would be wise if the police
were unable to question him

21:28.704 --> 21:31.117
thoroughly in this matter.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.583
Mrs. Van Bergen?

21:41.133 --> 21:43.250
I'm not asking.

22:47.575 --> 22:49.282
You asked for me again?

22:52.329 --> 22:54.195
What's wrong with your hands?

22:57.001 --> 23:00.711
Would you like to go
somewhere else tonight?

23:00.838 --> 23:04.707
I think I should
like to spoil you.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.502
We're not supposed to leave.

23:20.441 --> 23:23.730
We do a lot
we're not supposed to do.

23:32.119 --> 23:34.611
I've read of your
case, and I asked my colleagues

23:34.747 --> 23:37.660
at Bellevue if I might
conduct an interview.

23:37.791 --> 23:40.158
I'd like to better understand
what motivates you.

23:40.294 --> 23:43.128
Who are you anyway?

23:44.715 --> 23:46.297
I'm an alienist.

23:52.389 --> 23:55.803
How does it feel when you're
engaged in the act itself?

23:59.647 --> 24:01.604
Have you tried
to stop yourself?

24:01.732 --> 24:04.270
I thought I could.

24:04.401 --> 24:05.687
I even promised my parents,

24:05.819 --> 24:07.606
but the feeling
always comes back,

24:07.738 --> 24:10.105
and then I have to
do it again.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.818
I'm curious.

24:16.538 --> 24:20.031
The one you left
on your neighbor's porch.

24:22.044 --> 24:23.535
The one you cut up.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.122
What made you decide
to do that?

24:27.257 --> 24:30.591
Mr. Hoobler is a liar.

24:31.720 --> 24:33.006
He said it was a Chinaman

24:33.138 --> 24:34.845
snatching up
the dogs in the neighborhood

24:34.974 --> 24:36.681
'cause Chinamen eat dogs.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.597
He said he'd been there
and saw it with his own eyes.

24:39.728 --> 24:41.048
But you were the one
killing them.

24:41.105 --> 24:43.438
I said I was sorry!

24:43.565 --> 24:45.352
I even wrote letters
to their owners

24:45.484 --> 24:46.816
and asked them to forgive me.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.480
Your mother
wrote those letters.

24:51.573 --> 24:54.987
Do you not understand why some
of them want you punished?

24:56.120 --> 24:57.827
Charles?

25:00.165 --> 25:01.125
Charles!

25:02.918 --> 25:04.784
I asked you a question.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.754
They can go out
and get a new one!

25:07.881 --> 25:10.339
They're just stupid dogs!

25:10.467 --> 25:13.175
Stupid, stupid dogs.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.052
Boys, will you stop that now?

25:20.144 --> 25:21.976
I said stop.

25:27.985 --> 25:29.977
Ezra, stop that.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.815
They're all restless today.

25:34.950 --> 25:37.784
It must be the full moon.

25:37.911 --> 25:40.369
Certainly it has nothing to do
with the moon, Helen.

25:47.588 --> 25:50.626
I'm sorry your parents
didn't come this week, Ezra.

25:52.134 --> 25:53.966
Shall we write them a letter?

25:55.846 --> 25:58.213
Or we can
kick the ball together.

25:59.808 --> 26:02.050
Let's pretend
it's someone special.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.970
Who would you choose it to be?

26:05.105 --> 26:06.516
Mother.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.810
I'm sorry, Ezra,
I didn't hear you.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.855
- My mother.
- Are you sure?

26:11.987 --> 26:13.353
- My mother.
- Shout it.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.230
- My mother!
- Very well.

26:15.365 --> 26:17.402
Let's kick the stuffing
out of her.

26:20.954 --> 26:22.911
- My mother!
- That's good, Ezra.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.702
Once again.

26:25.959 --> 26:27.450
My mother!

26:32.966 --> 26:35.208
Very good, Ezra.

26:52.444 --> 26:54.936
Whoa. Whoa.

27:02.204 --> 27:03.204
Mary?

27:04.706 --> 27:06.322
Cyrus?

27:06.458 --> 27:08.415
Mary! Mary.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.035
Look, it's under the table.

27:10.170 --> 27:11.331
Oh!

27:11.463 --> 27:12.795
Grab it!

27:14.049 --> 27:17.008
That's why you can't
leave the back door open.

27:17.136 --> 27:18.798
Okay.

27:18.929 --> 27:21.091
Ah, Mr. Moore.
How are you, sir?

27:21.223 --> 27:22.759
- Is the doctor home?
- Last I saw,

27:22.891 --> 27:24.632
he was off to the park
with Miss Howard.

27:38.448 --> 27:42.488
I can see you're upset
by something more meaningful

27:42.619 --> 27:44.281
than a runaway chicken.

27:51.003 --> 27:53.461
I'm afraid the good doctor's
callous nature can sometimes

27:53.589 --> 27:55.797
upset the ones
who care about him the most.

28:03.724 --> 28:04.840
I have an idea, Mary.

28:04.975 --> 28:08.594
If Kreizler and Sara
can enjoy some respite together,

28:08.729 --> 28:09.810
so can we.

28:09.938 --> 28:13.773
Put on your best dress.
I'm taking you out.

28:15.819 --> 28:19.028
♪ Forward, sister women ♪

28:19.156 --> 28:22.490
♪ Onward ever more ♪

28:22.618 --> 28:24.280
♪ Bondage is behind you ♪

28:24.411 --> 28:26.073
Apparently,
it's the latest rage.

28:26.205 --> 28:28.413
Everyone's talking about it.

28:29.625 --> 28:33.790
I'm not quite sure what
Mr. Edison has come up with now.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.626
Maybe we should take a look.

28:37.758 --> 28:41.468
Watch out!
You're all going to get wet.

29:38.151 --> 29:40.814
Colt double-action
of.32 caliber,

29:40.946 --> 29:44.610
six shots,
and four-inch barrel.

29:44.741 --> 29:46.386
Commissioner, I wanted
to let you know I've done

29:46.410 --> 29:49.198
what you asked and delivered
the drawing kit to Dr. Kreizler.

29:49.329 --> 29:52.447
Good. Although I feel pity
for poor John.

29:52.582 --> 29:54.448
- Thank you, sir.
- Kreizler can be merciless

29:54.584 --> 29:56.166
when things don't go his way.

29:56.295 --> 29:57.706
I'm well aware
he is most determined

29:57.838 --> 30:00.956
to prove his point even if
it's at the expense of others.

30:07.347 --> 30:09.213
Excuse me, sir.

30:09.349 --> 30:12.433
But may I ask
what happened between you?

30:13.437 --> 30:16.350
I'm under the impression
you've an unsettled past.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.100
One time I ever managed to throw
that man on his heels...

30:23.030 --> 30:25.192
...it was in college.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.987
He was so angry,
he challenged me to a duel.

30:28.118 --> 30:30.576
I chose fists.

30:30.704 --> 30:33.321
In the gymnasium,
before all our classmates,

30:33.457 --> 30:35.540
we stripped to our waists.

30:37.669 --> 30:40.332
The whole room fell silent
when they saw his arm.

30:40.464 --> 30:45.084
Looks like a broken wing
held tight to his body.

30:45.218 --> 30:46.675
I couldn't do it.

30:48.305 --> 30:50.297
You wouldn't fight him?

30:50.432 --> 30:54.802
Everyone in that room was
bothered by his disadvantage.

30:56.188 --> 30:58.145
Everyone but him.

31:04.154 --> 31:05.440
Mary?

31:09.284 --> 31:10.616
Mary!

31:15.457 --> 31:16.948
Mary!

32:48.717 --> 32:49.717
Hm.

32:54.556 --> 32:56.047
Hello, Laszlo.

32:58.059 --> 33:01.723
Mary, you must tell me
when you're going out.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.945
Where have you been?

33:19.080 --> 33:20.912
To see Edison's Vitascope.

33:21.041 --> 33:22.998
You took Mary?

33:23.126 --> 33:25.834
Actually, I came here
looking for you,

33:25.962 --> 33:27.498
but you were with Sara.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.841
I have something for you.

33:44.648 --> 33:46.230
Why didn't you tell me
you'd lost it?

33:48.401 --> 33:50.358
I wasn't entirely aware
it had been lost.

33:50.487 --> 33:52.353
Either you knew it
or you didn't.

33:54.616 --> 33:56.278
I believe you're jealous.

34:00.121 --> 34:02.704
Can I ask you
to button my boots?

34:14.177 --> 34:16.510
I have news of the boy
killed at Castle Garden.

34:16.638 --> 34:19.005
I met a friend of his,
a young lad named Joseph,

34:19.139 --> 34:23.054
who told me the victim
met a "saint" who promised

34:23.186 --> 34:25.473
to take him
to a castle in the sky.

34:25.605 --> 34:28.313
You were asking me
if I was jealous just now.

34:28.440 --> 34:30.899
Tell me, were you jealous

34:31.027 --> 34:32.688
when Julia left you
for another man?

34:32.821 --> 34:35.063
Would you care to rub
any more salt in that wound?

34:35.197 --> 34:36.813
I'm not asking you
for sport, John.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.199
Of course I was jealous.

34:40.328 --> 34:43.286
And has that jealousy become
part of your sexual ritual

34:43.415 --> 34:45.371
when you sleep
with prostitutes?

34:47.210 --> 34:49.042
- I don't understand.
- Yes, you do.

34:50.297 --> 34:51.297
The other boot.

35:00.223 --> 35:02.681
The moment you met her,
or when she abandoned you?

35:05.979 --> 35:08.062
When she betrayed me.

35:10.400 --> 35:15.486
The sense of shame
affects me somehow.

35:17.198 --> 35:18.564
Brings you pleasure
and pain?

35:18.700 --> 35:22.159
What does this have to do
with our killer, Laszlo?

35:22.287 --> 35:24.074
He's eroticizing
a past trauma.

35:24.205 --> 35:26.822
The act of murder mirrors
something that was done to him.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.665
But this is clever talk.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.160
We won't find him
by dissecting our own minds.

35:31.296 --> 35:34.130
Nor shall we find him by looking
for men with silver smiles.

35:34.257 --> 35:37.466
Chasing clues will mean
he's always a step ahead of us.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.301
We must see
what's behind the clues.

35:42.057 --> 35:43.617
If you're so convinced
of your theories,

35:43.642 --> 35:45.508
go and speak to a dentist.

35:47.228 --> 35:49.936
Why must you push away
those who care for you?

35:50.065 --> 35:53.183
To bring you pleasure or pain?

35:54.986 --> 35:56.727
The question you should
be asking is not

35:56.863 --> 36:00.823
why I push you away
but why you stay.

36:03.244 --> 36:04.610
Button your own boots.

36:19.803 --> 36:21.294
Okay, spit.

36:21.429 --> 36:22.670
Spit.

36:33.149 --> 36:35.357
Ulysses, stop that a moment.

36:41.574 --> 36:43.861
Mr. Moore.

36:43.993 --> 36:46.180
I didn't see your name in
the appointment book. Do you...

36:46.204 --> 36:47.564
My teeth are quite fine,
thank you.

36:47.622 --> 36:50.660
But I do have a question.

36:50.792 --> 36:55.457
Have you ever encountered
a silver smile?

36:55.588 --> 36:56.669
A what?

36:56.798 --> 36:58.414
I'm looking for
what might cause someone

36:58.550 --> 36:59.791
to have a silver smile?

37:06.391 --> 37:09.259
- What did he say?
- He said mercury salts.

37:09.394 --> 37:12.307
For what purpose?

37:17.694 --> 37:21.779
He said, "One night with Venus,
a lifetime with Mercury."

37:26.828 --> 37:28.035
Thank you.

38:14.751 --> 38:17.368
You know there's people
gossiping, you with that girl.

38:17.504 --> 38:19.666
Just because she didn't
grow up in a shtetl

38:19.798 --> 38:21.380
doesn't make her
any less of a Jew.

38:27.597 --> 38:29.634
Besides,
doesn't the Torah say desire

38:29.766 --> 38:31.803
is no more a sin
than hunger or thirst?

38:31.935 --> 38:34.598
If you'd ever bothered
to read the Torah,

38:34.729 --> 38:36.061
you'd know it says
no such thing.

38:36.189 --> 38:37.958
It says there are impulses
we have to control.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.975
That's what makes men
different than beasts.

38:41.986 --> 38:45.354
Well, I suppose I fall
somewhere between the two.

38:53.456 --> 38:54.992
Syphilis!

38:56.626 --> 38:57.626
I beg your pardon?

38:57.669 --> 38:59.001
He was treated for syphilis.

38:59.128 --> 39:00.768
It's what gave his teeth
the silver color.

39:00.797 --> 39:04.006
Cases of congenital syphilis
can disfigure teeth.

39:04.133 --> 39:06.375
I've never heard of it
discoloring them.

39:06.511 --> 39:09.219
I spoke to a dentist, Laszlo.

39:23.194 --> 39:27.655
Facts, figures, along with
numerous suppositions...

39:27.782 --> 39:30.445
pieces of a puzzle
that right now lack form,

39:30.577 --> 39:32.534
match no psychological outline.

39:37.000 --> 39:41.586
What we are missing, John,
is not how he kills, but why.

39:41.713 --> 39:45.502
And most importantly,
<i>when</i> will he kill again?

40:04.485 --> 40:05.851
Mamma!

40:08.489 --> 40:09.489
Mamma!

40:27.967 --> 40:29.083
Mamma!

40:46.778 --> 40:48.644
Wait. Wait!

41:28.152 --> 41:30.815
- Hello, John.
- Laszlo.

41:30.947 --> 41:34.190
I haven't been here in years.
I see it's not changed.

41:34.325 --> 41:38.786
The same as yesterday,
today, and forever.

41:39.914 --> 41:41.701
So...

41:41.833 --> 41:43.495
Tell me your purpose
in meeting?

41:43.626 --> 41:47.210
I've not asked you here.
You asked me.

41:47.338 --> 41:49.295
John, I received the message
at the institute

41:49.424 --> 41:51.131
that you wished to see me.

41:51.259 --> 41:53.501
I was directed to come here.

41:53.636 --> 41:56.049
But you called
my grandmother's house?

41:56.180 --> 41:58.593
You spoke to her yourself.

41:58.725 --> 42:00.591
Good evening, gentlemen.

42:01.978 --> 42:05.187
How you've come to be here,
Detective Sergeants?

42:05.314 --> 42:06.521
We took a trolley.

42:06.649 --> 42:10.484
I mean, who has asked you
to present yourselves?

42:10.611 --> 42:12.068
You did.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.655
- And how did I do that?
- You sent us a telegram.

42:17.618 --> 42:18.984
Did you not send it?

42:19.120 --> 42:20.406
You <i>are</i> here.

42:22.248 --> 42:25.116
It's remarkable, isn't it?

42:25.251 --> 42:26.833
Is this taken?

42:26.961 --> 42:28.327
What is remarkable,
Miss Howard?

42:28.463 --> 42:30.830
That you're here,
all of you.

42:30.965 --> 42:34.049
It's as if you've
anticipated the moment.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.426
Mrs. Santorelli and her son

42:40.558 --> 42:42.675
brought this to me
at police headquarters.

42:42.810 --> 42:45.018
I'd only just read it when
I got your message, Doctor.

42:46.022 --> 42:47.513
My message was to meet here?

42:47.648 --> 42:48.648
Yes.

42:51.235 --> 42:54.444
I'm sorry. I should have been
more careful about handling it.

43:00.453 --> 43:02.194
I have to admit,
holding it in my hand

43:02.330 --> 43:04.822
gave me a certain exhilaration
that I wasn't expecting.

43:04.957 --> 43:07.495
I felt I could almost hear
his voice in my head

43:07.627 --> 43:09.493
while reading the words.

43:13.966 --> 43:16.379
Did you come directly
from police headquarters?

43:16.511 --> 43:18.844
I got your message and took
a hansom straightaway.

43:18.971 --> 43:20.007
Why?

43:20.139 --> 43:22.005
Yes.

43:22.141 --> 43:24.098
Why?

43:24.227 --> 43:26.435
Why wasn't
killing the boy enough?

43:26.562 --> 43:29.771
Why must you send a letter
as well?

43:33.861 --> 43:39.152
I want to inflict pain,
and I won't be satisfied

43:39.283 --> 43:42.822
unless I can see the suffering
that I'm causing.

43:42.954 --> 43:44.194
He was watching
the Santorellis.

43:44.288 --> 43:47.247
Yes.
I can see her agony.

43:47.375 --> 43:50.163
I can hear her cries.

43:50.294 --> 43:54.538
I watch her,
and it leads me to...

43:58.136 --> 43:59.136
...you.

44:00.263 --> 44:01.845
Easy, Laszlo.

44:01.973 --> 44:03.839
I follow you,
with the letter in your hand

44:03.975 --> 44:06.137
from Mulberry Street
to Brubacher's,

44:06.269 --> 44:08.761
where you sit down to share
this horrid property

44:08.896 --> 44:11.639
with your colleagues
who've already been assembled

44:11.774 --> 44:13.766
at my direction.

44:13.901 --> 44:16.188
You mean
<i>he</i> asked me to come?

44:16.320 --> 44:18.357
He asked all of us.

44:21.075 --> 44:24.034
He's watching us.

44:55.193 --> 44:57.936
"My dear Mrs. Santorelli,

44:58.070 --> 45:01.529
I don't know as it is you
what is the source

45:01.657 --> 45:03.865
of the vile LIES
I read in the newspapers

45:03.993 --> 45:06.576
or if the police are behind it

45:06.704 --> 45:09.538
and the reporters
are part of their scheme.

45:09.665 --> 45:13.955
But I figger it might be you,
and I take this occashun

45:14.086 --> 45:16.749
to straten you out.

45:16.881 --> 45:20.500
In some parts of this world,
such as where dirty immigrants

45:20.635 --> 45:23.469
like yourself come from,
it is often that human flesh

45:23.596 --> 45:27.681
is eaten regular
as other food is so scarce

45:27.808 --> 45:30.551
and people would starve
without it.

45:33.439 --> 45:36.307
Of course it is usuly children
what is eaten

45:36.442 --> 45:39.185
as they are tenderest
and best tasting,

45:39.320 --> 45:43.360
especially the ass
of a small child.

45:43.491 --> 45:46.905
And then these people that
eat it come here to America,

45:47.036 --> 45:49.995
dirtier than a Red Injun.

45:50.122 --> 45:53.240
On February 19th,
I seen your boy

45:53.376 --> 45:55.618
parading himself
outside the church

45:55.753 --> 45:57.710
with dirt and paint on his face.

45:58.756 --> 46:02.295
I decided to wait
and saw him several times

46:02.426 --> 46:06.136
before one night I took him
away from THAT PLACE.

46:07.723 --> 46:13.310
Saucy boy, I already
knew I must eat him.

46:14.397 --> 46:16.514
So we went
straight to the bridge,

46:16.649 --> 46:20.609
and I trussed him
and did him quick.

46:20.736 --> 46:23.774
I collected his eyes
and took his ass,

46:23.906 --> 46:28.867
and it fed me for a week,
roasted with onions and carrots.

46:28.995 --> 46:32.409
But I never had him,
though I could have.

46:32.540 --> 46:34.827
And he would have liked me to.

46:37.253 --> 46:42.840
He died unspoiled by me,
and the papers ought to say so."

46:42.967 --> 46:44.253
Evening, girls.

46:45.261 --> 46:48.345
Which one of you
is up for a little fun?
