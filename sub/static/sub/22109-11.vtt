WEBVTT

00:04.438 --> 00:05.573
Aah!

00:10.211 --> 00:11.945
(shrieks)

00:17.218 --> 00:19.120
(school bell rings)

00:21.021 --> 00:21.989
(belches)

00:22.022 --> 00:23.023
(tires screech)

00:25.126 --> 00:26.660
D'oh!

00:26.694 --> 00:29.097
(tires screech, grunts)

00:29.130 --> 00:31.232
Is she gonna be okay, Doc?

00:31.265 --> 00:32.833
She's just fine.

00:32.866 --> 00:35.169
-And here's the baby.
-Oh...

00:35.203 --> 00:37.405
I know how to hold
one of these.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.273
D'oh!

00:41.209 --> 00:43.144
*

00:49.049 --> 00:52.553
(classical music plays on TV)

00:52.586 --> 00:54.288
ANNOUNCER: You're watching
The Learning Network,

00:54.322 --> 00:55.556
where minds grow.

00:55.589 --> 00:57.425
Stay tuned for...

00:57.458 --> 00:59.160
(dramatic voice):

01:04.332 --> 01:06.167
But first...

01:10.304 --> 01:13.741
The following film,
made in 1982,

01:13.774 --> 01:15.376
was thought to be lost forever.

01:15.409 --> 01:17.611
Actually, it was misplaced
in a box

01:17.645 --> 01:20.114
for the comedy Doctor Detroit.

01:20.148 --> 01:23.284
But its predictions are
more terrifying than ever.

01:23.317 --> 01:26.920
Hello, I'm Orson... Welles,

01:26.954 --> 01:28.556
director of Citizen Kane...

01:28.589 --> 01:29.823
Boring.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.625
...as well as the lower
left-hand square

01:31.659 --> 01:33.060
on Hollywood Squares.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.229
Ooh, right next to Ruth Buzzi.

01:35.263 --> 01:38.766
In 1555, the prophet Nostradamus

01:38.799 --> 01:41.602
foretold a terrifying series
of predictions,

01:41.635 --> 01:43.771
all of which came to pass.

01:43.804 --> 01:46.774
First, his own death.
Second,

01:46.807 --> 01:49.977
large wars in Europe,
similar to the large wars

01:50.010 --> 01:51.279
he observed in Europe.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.981
And the breakup
of Fleetwood Mac.

01:54.014 --> 01:56.984
But Nostradamus's
final quatrain contained

01:57.017 --> 01:59.987
one more prediction
yet to come:

02:00.020 --> 02:03.824
that shortly after the
Antichrist becomes president...

02:08.162 --> 02:09.663
(slurping)

02:09.697 --> 02:11.299
This champagne is terrible.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.434
It tastes like dryer sheets.

02:13.467 --> 02:16.504
But what does
said mushroom signify?

02:16.537 --> 02:20.007
Nothing less than World War III.

02:20.040 --> 02:22.676
Ugh, who'd fall for
this malarkey?

02:22.710 --> 02:24.712
(gasps)
Smithers, I'm scared.

02:24.745 --> 02:27.114
-Release the comforting hounds.
-(snaps fingers)

02:27.147 --> 02:28.649
(dogs whining)

02:28.682 --> 02:30.451
Oh, excellent.
Now, make them into rugs.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.885
(dog whines)

02:31.919 --> 02:36.023
Anyone left alive will surely
find themselves envying...

02:36.056 --> 02:38.125
Who? Who could we possibly envy?

02:38.158 --> 02:40.127
-...the dead.
-Aah!

02:40.160 --> 02:42.062
Smithers, the end is nigh,
and we must prepare.

02:42.095 --> 02:44.565
Round up this town's
greatest minds.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.200
-Should I order pizza?
-Uh-huh.

02:46.234 --> 02:48.302
One large cheese, double-cut.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.271
(dramatic music plays)

02:52.105 --> 02:53.641
Attention, fellow members

02:53.674 --> 02:56.176
of the Springfield chapter
of Mensa.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.078
Mr. Burns has called us here

02:58.111 --> 03:02.516
to solve an unknown problem
of global importance.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.486
But first, Tri-Ominoes!

03:05.519 --> 03:07.555
I say we write and solve
our own acrostics.

03:07.588 --> 03:09.557
Yes, after we recite
all the words

03:09.590 --> 03:11.191
in the
Declaration of Independence

03:11.225 --> 03:12.860
in alphabetical order.

03:12.893 --> 03:16.096
ALL:
A, A, A, A, A, A.

03:16.129 --> 03:20.000
Abdicated. Abolish. Abolishing.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.569
Absolute. Absolved.

03:21.602 --> 03:23.371
Silence, you thinkertons.

03:23.404 --> 03:25.906
I summoned you here because
the world is about to end.

03:25.939 --> 03:28.075
No, it isn't.
What are you afraid of?

03:28.108 --> 03:30.077
Global warming?
(laughs)

03:30.110 --> 03:33.113
A.I.?
Some sort of plague?

03:33.146 --> 03:36.016
(laughs)

03:36.049 --> 03:38.786
As smarty-pantalones,
I am asking you to help with

03:38.819 --> 03:41.054
the Montgomery Burns
Doomsday Ark.

03:41.088 --> 03:43.757
This space vehicle will lead
humanity's best and brightest

03:43.791 --> 03:47.027
to a better life
under my stern rule.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.962
SIDESHOW MEL:
Oh, gee heavens.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.599
Will there be someone for
your more personal needs?

03:51.632 --> 03:54.201
Concubines.
Many concubines.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.603
I'll work my way in.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.471
I need you to tell me
who is worthy

03:57.505 --> 03:59.807
of surviving
the apocalypse with me.

03:59.840 --> 04:03.377
I only want the sharpest razors
in this town's Halloween candy.

04:03.411 --> 04:06.414
Oh, don't worry, Mr. Burns,
this is what Mensa does best--

04:06.447 --> 04:08.282
make everyone else feel stupid.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.050
The only word in English

04:10.083 --> 04:13.053
with three consecutive
double letters is...

04:13.086 --> 04:14.121
-Oh, um...
-Um...

04:14.154 --> 04:15.088
Um, "gooseberry."

04:15.122 --> 04:17.057
No, "coffee." Coffee-oo.

04:17.090 --> 04:19.460
-Uh, balloon-an-ing.
-Bookkeeper.

04:19.493 --> 04:20.928
-Damn it.
-Ha!

04:20.961 --> 04:22.796
It's simple.
All we need to do is

04:22.830 --> 04:24.998
give everyone in town
an IQ test.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.067
The highest scores
get on the ark--

04:27.100 --> 04:29.102
Mensa members grandfathered in.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.304
-Sounds good to me.
-(all agreeing)

04:30.338 --> 04:31.739
Grandfathered!

04:31.772 --> 04:34.274
Not so fast. Flavin.

04:34.308 --> 04:36.977
Being intelligent people,
I am quite sure

04:37.010 --> 04:38.178
that you will take this well.

04:38.211 --> 04:40.448
IQs are meaningless.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.582
-(all gasp)
-SIDESHOW MEL: Heresy!

04:41.615 --> 04:43.484
I have the ultimate test

04:43.517 --> 04:46.520
that measures something
far more significant:

04:46.554 --> 04:50.090
your overall worth as a human.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.425
Impossible.

04:51.459 --> 04:53.260
Intelligence
is the only quotient

04:53.293 --> 04:55.028
that tells you
how important you are.

04:55.062 --> 04:58.899
Ask any of us who did well on
a test we took when we were six.

05:01.569 --> 05:04.805
Well, you may be the brightest,
but you are not the best.

05:04.838 --> 05:08.275
Your worthiness as a human being
is best measured, people,

05:08.308 --> 05:12.212
by the Personal Value Quotient.
That's P.V.Q.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.882
Oh! Ow! All right,
enough with the pelting

05:14.915 --> 05:16.984
and the bonking
and the compass in my neck.

05:17.017 --> 05:18.786
Garvik.
In order to defuse

05:18.819 --> 05:20.220
your obvious hostilities,

05:20.253 --> 05:22.990
I will make my presentation
entertaining, all right?

05:23.023 --> 05:26.694
With a one, and a two,
and a 3.14159.

05:26.727 --> 05:30.197
Forgive me if it seems like
I'm attacking,

05:30.230 --> 05:33.801
but I find the old IQ test
badly lacking.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.804
If you want to find out
just what someone can do,

05:36.837 --> 05:41.575
you need to learn
that subject's P.V.Q.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.644
*

05:43.677 --> 05:46.680
* It tests for

05:46.714 --> 05:50.217
* Sympathy and empathy
and group collaboration *

05:50.250 --> 05:54.021
* Artistry and neatness
and complex socialization *

05:54.054 --> 05:57.357
* And every single aspect
of a personality *

05:57.391 --> 05:59.493
-* Hey, the P.V.Q.
-(gasps)

05:59.527 --> 06:03.597
* Is A.O.K. with me
(laughs)

06:03.631 --> 06:06.166
*

06:06.199 --> 06:09.002
* It tests for sarcasm
and prudence *

06:09.036 --> 06:11.204
* Not if you're Isaac Newton

06:11.238 --> 06:12.873
* Confidence, ambition

06:12.906 --> 06:14.608
* And the teams for whom
you're rootin' *

06:14.642 --> 06:16.777
* So it's all
the little foibles *

06:16.810 --> 06:18.345
* That can make a person whole

06:18.378 --> 06:20.581
* Trust the P.V.Q.

06:20.614 --> 06:24.485
* The yardstick for the soul

06:30.458 --> 06:31.625
(exclaims)

06:31.659 --> 06:33.861
* Now, people,
you're all geniuses *

06:33.894 --> 06:35.563
-Oh, please...
-My, my, well, thank you.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.465
* You can see this is no lark

06:37.498 --> 06:40.968
* Emotional intelligence
is needed for the ark *

06:41.001 --> 06:42.736
-Uh-huh.
-Hmm...

06:48.642 --> 06:50.811
*

06:50.844 --> 06:52.946
* You mean earnestness
and ego *

06:52.980 --> 06:54.815
* And if they make
a mean burrito *

06:54.848 --> 06:56.584
* And the social grace to know

06:56.617 --> 06:58.819
* When not to wear a Speedo

06:58.852 --> 07:01.955
* Every trait that integrates
a winning personality *

07:01.989 --> 07:03.924
* Yes, the P.V.Q.

07:03.957 --> 07:07.461
* Is what we'll do
to find out who *

07:07.495 --> 07:09.597
* Will see us through

07:09.630 --> 07:11.398
* Yes, the P.V.Q.

07:11.431 --> 07:14.067
* Is A.O.K.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.304
* With me...

07:19.139 --> 07:20.407
Oivik!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.743
Anyone have a song in rebuttal?

07:22.776 --> 07:25.412
* You got to have hear...

07:25.445 --> 07:26.914
Oh, balderdash.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.181
We're going with
this man's test.

07:28.215 --> 07:30.317
-Oh, wonderful.
-To determine who is worthy

07:30.350 --> 07:31.985
of a seat on my ark.

07:32.019 --> 07:34.087
Uh, but, sir, how do we
get everyone in town

07:34.121 --> 07:36.490
to take a test without
telling them what it's about?

07:38.125 --> 07:40.628
Mandatory test.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.429
Mandatory test!

07:42.462 --> 07:45.966
Mandatory for everyone
not ringing a bell.

07:48.401 --> 07:49.970
What's the point
of this test again?

07:50.003 --> 07:51.539
The way I look at it,
the more things

07:51.572 --> 07:54.107
secret corporations know
about us, the better, huh?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.943
I like when drones show up
bringing me things

07:55.976 --> 07:57.511
I needed but didn't know.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.479
Hmm.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.314
Wow, I am out of deodorant.

08:01.348 --> 08:02.550
We all knew.

08:02.583 --> 08:04.785
Remove all stray marks.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.987
Number two pencil only.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.156
And for God's sake, relax!

08:09.189 --> 08:11.825
This question asks about
the price of underwear,

08:11.859 --> 08:14.695
as if I were some
landed aristocrat.

08:14.728 --> 08:16.630
(quietly):
Hey, can I copy off you?

08:16.664 --> 08:17.931
Be my guest.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.334
(laughs)

08:21.368 --> 08:25.072
"Day is to night
as early is to..."

08:25.105 --> 08:27.541
Late. Booyah!

08:27.575 --> 08:30.010
(groans)

08:30.043 --> 08:31.645
Booyah!

08:31.679 --> 08:34.214
(groans)

08:34.247 --> 08:36.049
Booyah!

08:36.083 --> 08:38.552
(groans)

08:38.586 --> 08:41.855
The one test I don't
bring my earmuffs.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.156
BROCKMAN (on TV):
The results are in.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.058
The newest
and most accurate measure

08:45.092 --> 08:47.761
of our intelligence
on a scale from one to 500--

08:47.795 --> 08:49.763
500 being best.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.165
-(singsongy): Boring.
-Don't shut it off.

08:52.199 --> 08:53.767
I need my score.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.903
(hyperventilating)

08:55.936 --> 08:57.537
(muffled):
Thank you.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.940
Now we'll run everyone's scores
past the screen really fast,

08:59.973 --> 09:01.875
from best to worst,
trusting that you'll pause

09:01.909 --> 09:03.811
at only your name.

09:05.112 --> 09:07.347
Pause it!

09:07.380 --> 09:10.517
475, my sweet spot. Excellent.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.052
But room to improve.

09:13.987 --> 09:17.591
What?!
I am one below Ralph? Ralph?

09:17.625 --> 09:20.227
Honey, it doesn't mean
Ralph's smarter than you.

09:20.260 --> 09:24.031
It just means he's
a more valuable person.

09:24.064 --> 09:26.466
-Ralph?
-Keep scrolling.

09:27.500 --> 09:30.070
MARGE:
Ooh, 311.

09:30.103 --> 09:32.606
Above average, but not enough
to make people mad.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.943
And, it's the number you call
to complain about potholes.

09:35.976 --> 09:40.080
Ooh. "H. Simpson: 265."

09:40.113 --> 09:41.715
Exactly the number
of days in a year.

09:41.749 --> 09:43.050
(chuckles)

09:43.083 --> 09:45.085
Well, that's good.
Let's change the channel.

09:45.118 --> 09:46.787
But we don't know your score.

09:46.820 --> 09:49.056
Like I said, that's good.

09:49.089 --> 09:52.325
Hmm, not there.
Not there. Not there.

09:52.359 --> 09:55.295
(gasps)

09:58.498 --> 10:00.668
(sobbing)

10:02.202 --> 10:04.504
I don't need any test.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.339
I'm street-smart.

10:06.373 --> 10:07.641
(bicycle bell dinging)

10:07.675 --> 10:09.009
Haw-haw!

10:13.681 --> 10:15.949
I refuse to accept that
my little guy has no future.

10:15.983 --> 10:18.451
He can learn how to
put in adding machine tape.

10:18.485 --> 10:20.187
That's how I got through
the Depression,

10:20.220 --> 10:22.823
and letting the FBI know
which bugle boys

10:22.856 --> 10:24.858
were about to turn
boogie-woogie.

10:24.892 --> 10:26.694
We're not giving up on Bart.

10:26.727 --> 10:28.528
And I'm not giving up
on you, Homer.

10:28.561 --> 10:30.630
What, you're still trying?
In what way?

10:30.664 --> 10:33.366
My will is 38 pages
of me yelling at you.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.035
Ooh, I'm in the will.

10:38.505 --> 10:41.008
ORSON WELLES:
Charles. Listen to me, Charles.

10:41.041 --> 10:42.876
Not now, Satan.

10:42.910 --> 10:44.978
I'm not Satan, I'm Orson Welles.

10:45.012 --> 10:48.181
Satan would sell wine
before its time.

10:48.215 --> 10:52.019
Yes. Now, have you taken
my warning seriously?

10:52.052 --> 10:53.987
Oh, but I did.
I've already started the ark.

10:54.021 --> 10:55.455
Very good. Now I must go.

10:55.488 --> 10:57.825
God commissioned me
to direct a rainbow,

10:57.858 --> 11:00.060
and I've spent half
my budget on indigo.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.963
The only answer
is to play "red" myself.

11:02.996 --> 11:05.065
-Smithers. Speed up production
on the ark. -(bell rings)

11:05.098 --> 11:06.700
Put everyone on it.

11:06.734 --> 11:09.169
Ply them with all the rum
and salt it takes.

11:15.408 --> 11:18.912
-Eh, there's no nap
like a scaffold nap. -(snoring)

11:21.014 --> 11:22.750
Hey, what do you think
we're building, anyway?

11:22.783 --> 11:24.985
I'm betting it's a new
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.854
Maybe this one
will keep somebody out.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.057
How can Ralph score higher
than me?

11:30.090 --> 11:32.259
That's-that's just wrong.
(chuckles)

11:32.292 --> 11:34.995
But all my self-esteem comes
from tests.

11:35.028 --> 11:38.866
Should I really be pulling
on this string?

11:38.899 --> 11:40.734
I am not worse than Ralph!

11:40.768 --> 11:42.870
(shouts, grunts)

11:42.903 --> 11:46.073
-Hi, Ralph.
-Hi, Ralph. -Hi, Ralph.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.074
Hi, Ralph.

11:47.107 --> 11:50.110
I miss the string
through my ears.

11:51.578 --> 11:52.746
LISA:
All right, Lisa.

11:52.780 --> 11:55.082
Watch, do not judge.

11:56.116 --> 11:58.285
What makes him superior?

11:59.286 --> 12:02.790
(laughing) Whee!

12:02.823 --> 12:04.391
I'm okay.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.695
WIGGUM (over phone): You have
reached the Wiggum residence.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.431
If Ralph is stuck in something,
press one.

12:11.464 --> 12:14.134
If something is stuck in Ralph,
press two.

12:14.167 --> 12:17.805
If this is Ralph,
Daddy is not in the phone.

12:17.838 --> 12:20.774
Do not open the phone
looking for me.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.142
What are you doing?

12:22.175 --> 12:23.210
The only thing I'm good at.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.311
Nothing.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.745
That tears it.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.447
We're going to see
Professor Frink,

12:27.480 --> 12:30.383
and find out exactly
what happened on that test.

12:30.417 --> 12:31.885
Got a little present
for you, Bart.

12:31.919 --> 12:35.155
It's called
The Bible For The Slow. Mm?

12:35.188 --> 12:36.656
He's not going to take it.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.458
Okily-dokily.

12:38.491 --> 12:42.095
Professor Frink, your stupid
test ruined my son's life.

12:42.129 --> 12:44.064
Hey, that test
is like a son to me.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.999
I raised it from a quiz.

12:46.033 --> 12:47.634
I've known my son
since he was born,

12:47.667 --> 12:50.170
and he's not anywhere
near as stupid

12:50.203 --> 12:52.072
as your stupid test says he is.

12:52.105 --> 12:56.076
And if you think so,
you're stupid, stupid, stupid!

12:56.109 --> 12:57.845
Wow, Marge.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.080
You really love Bart.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.415
All right, all right,
let me recheck it.

13:02.449 --> 13:04.184
Uh, rechecking, rechecking.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.652
Put-upon sigh.

13:05.685 --> 13:06.820
(sighs):
Oivik.

13:06.854 --> 13:09.022
Rechecking-- ah, here we are.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.257
Uh, Simpson, B.

13:10.290 --> 13:14.094
That's not a "B."

13:14.127 --> 13:15.462
FRINK: Well, yes, it is,
you see, the two--

13:15.495 --> 13:16.964
oh, my garvik!

13:16.997 --> 13:18.999
There was a mistake.
Well, your son

13:19.032 --> 13:21.134
has above-average intelligence.

13:21.168 --> 13:22.302
You did it, boy.

13:22.335 --> 13:23.670
No, that just looks like a "B."

13:23.703 --> 13:26.039
The real unfortunate
is H. Simpson.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.008
(laughs):
I mean, what a clod!

13:28.041 --> 13:31.178
Worst handwriting
and brain in town.

13:31.211 --> 13:32.179
-D'oh!
-BART: Hey!

13:32.212 --> 13:33.680
I'm H. Simpson.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.348
Oh, well, it's very nice
to meet you.

13:35.382 --> 13:36.649
Would you like some water?

13:36.683 --> 13:37.684
-Smartwater?
-No.

13:37.717 --> 13:38.751
(moans sadly)

13:43.223 --> 13:44.992
-Homie, aren't you coming?
-FRINK: Bye-bye.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.726
I can't. I'll be a laughing
stock when everyone finds out

13:46.759 --> 13:48.328
I'm the stupidest man in town.

13:48.361 --> 13:49.629
How are they gonna find out?

13:49.662 --> 13:51.031
I just tweeted it.

13:51.064 --> 13:54.201
Marge, you have to get ahead
of these stories.

13:58.071 --> 14:00.707
I'm sorry, sir, you belong here.

14:00.740 --> 14:02.775
Oh! Oh.

14:08.615 --> 14:09.983
Look thou be true.

14:10.017 --> 14:11.384
Do not give dalliance.

14:11.418 --> 14:13.520
Too much of the rein.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.722
(muttering)

14:15.755 --> 14:18.325
Why does Oscar skate
in his trash can?

14:18.358 --> 14:19.726
It makes no sense!

14:19.759 --> 14:20.894
(moans)

14:22.029 --> 14:23.796
I'll cheer up here.

14:24.797 --> 14:27.067
One "stupid," please?

14:27.100 --> 14:29.102
Okay, you gave me $40.

14:29.136 --> 14:30.370
Here's two dollars back.

14:30.403 --> 14:32.405
Unless you want
splash insurance.

14:32.439 --> 14:34.174
-How much is that?
-Another ten.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.408
Uh, here's $20.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.310
And two more for you.

14:38.912 --> 14:41.781
(humming)

14:41.814 --> 14:44.084
-(yelps) -Insurance doesn't
cover entryway splashes.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.352
D'oh!

14:45.385 --> 14:48.956
Hey, Homer, uh, we was watching
Jeopardy!, but, uh,

14:48.989 --> 14:52.025
tell you what, we'll just talk
about shapes and colors now.

14:52.059 --> 14:54.294
I like blue rectangles.

14:54.327 --> 14:56.096
Rectangles. You know, Homer.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.431
The ones with four sides.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.200
Listen, you.

15:00.233 --> 15:03.070
I've known my shapes
since I was 16!

15:03.103 --> 15:06.073
Put him down, Homer,
and I'll give you a cookie.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.707
That's a coaster.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.242
Ooh! Dummy's wising up.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.278
I'll take the cookie.

15:11.311 --> 15:15.282
I never thought I'd say this,
but I'm too depressed for Moe's.

15:21.621 --> 15:22.922
MOE:
Heya, Homer.

15:22.956 --> 15:25.959
I'm sorry. I know I'm taking up
too much of the bed.

15:25.993 --> 15:28.128
Oh, sweetie.

15:28.161 --> 15:31.264
What the entire world thinks
doesn't affect how I see you.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.066
Well, how do you see me?

15:33.100 --> 15:37.004
The hair and body
of a dashing Friar Tuck.

15:37.037 --> 15:40.007
Ooh. (moaning)

15:40.040 --> 15:41.508
But what about my brains?

15:41.541 --> 15:44.011
My favorite character
in The Wizard of Oz

15:44.044 --> 15:46.946
was always the Scarecrow.

15:46.980 --> 15:48.481
I knew it. Thanks to that test,

15:48.515 --> 15:50.417
you see me as stupid first
and Homer third.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.851
I mean, second.

15:51.884 --> 15:52.952
I know second.

15:52.986 --> 15:54.021
I won't let you give up.

15:54.054 --> 15:56.323
We're going to start
improving you.

15:56.356 --> 15:58.291
Oh, Marge. No one ever did
anything useful

15:58.325 --> 16:00.093
after the age of 39.

16:00.127 --> 16:01.961
George W. Bush sobered up.

16:01.995 --> 16:03.330
And became president.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.098
Too huge mistakes.

16:05.132 --> 16:06.699
Homie, this whole mix-up
happened

16:06.733 --> 16:08.868
because of
your sloppy handwriting.

16:08.901 --> 16:11.704
We'll start with that,
improving your handwriting.

16:11.738 --> 16:15.475
Right now, my hand just wants
to crawl in my pocket and cry.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.778
Now this hand is jealous.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.979
Mwah.

16:20.013 --> 16:21.948
I know where this is going.

16:21.981 --> 16:25.785
Um, I do, too,
but you say it first.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.287
Snuggling.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.921
(gasps)
Ooh.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.292
(Ralph humming)

16:32.325 --> 16:35.895
What is his secret?
What is his secret?!

16:35.928 --> 16:37.964
I'm going to Dizzyland.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.999
*

16:45.538 --> 16:47.707
Want to see me do a cartwheel?

16:47.740 --> 16:49.576
-No! No, no, no!
-Good point.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.379
On the other hand, whee!
(giggles)

16:52.412 --> 16:53.980
(tires screech)

16:54.013 --> 16:56.083
Don't worry, Lou,
I've seen that in cartoons.

16:56.116 --> 16:59.086
Swee'Pea, Mr. Magoo,
they were fine.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.820
What about Sylvester the Cat?

17:00.853 --> 17:03.190
Never be a cat
in a cartoon, Lou.

17:03.223 --> 17:04.191
Never.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.228
-(Lisa screams)
-(Ralph laughs)

17:11.030 --> 17:12.665
LISA: The beam must have
a fulcrum I can move to

17:12.699 --> 17:13.866
that would stabilize it.

17:13.900 --> 17:16.103
Think, Lisa, think.

17:16.136 --> 17:19.372
(ship horn blows)

17:19.406 --> 17:20.773
Oh!
(panting)

17:23.910 --> 17:25.112
(bicycle bell dinging)

17:25.145 --> 17:27.147
Two for two.

17:29.082 --> 17:32.552
Young man, didn't I tell you
to sit and stay in that house?

17:32.585 --> 17:34.554
I thought you were talking
to the dog.

17:34.587 --> 17:36.089
We don't have a dog.

17:36.123 --> 17:37.957
Then what's been pooping
in my bedroom?

17:37.990 --> 17:42.095
Professor, how on Earth did he
get a higher score than me?

17:42.129 --> 17:45.932
Okay, Lisa, I am going
to give you ten more points

17:45.965 --> 17:48.201
for one of the most important
skills of all:

17:48.235 --> 17:51.938
discovering huge flaws in
my test without telling anyone.

17:51.971 --> 17:53.773
(laughs)

17:53.806 --> 17:56.243
You mean, after all this,
after all I've gone through,

17:56.276 --> 17:59.946
you're just gonna fudge my score
and I should be happy?

17:59.979 --> 18:02.449
Well, after all,
that's how I got into, uh...

18:02.482 --> 18:04.117
Oh, I can't say it.

18:04.151 --> 18:05.585
The lowest of the Ivys.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.120
Oh, God, help me-- Cornell!

18:07.154 --> 18:08.321
Cornell! God!

18:08.355 --> 18:09.556
It's okay, you're fine.

18:09.589 --> 18:11.124
Oh, gloyvik.

18:11.158 --> 18:12.959
Okay, Homie, buckle up.

18:12.992 --> 18:16.629
Because there's no limit to how
neat your handwriting can get.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.097
Marge, I don't know.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.966
You can't teach
an old dog new tricks.

18:19.999 --> 18:23.436
(harmonica playing)

18:23.470 --> 18:24.904
I'll help you.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.174
* Whoa

18:27.207 --> 18:29.809
* My love...

18:29.842 --> 18:32.579
Lisa, turn off
that oldies station!

18:32.612 --> 18:34.147
-* My darl...
-(music stops)

18:57.136 --> 18:58.805
HOMER:
Dearest Marjorie,

18:58.838 --> 19:01.774
what words are adequate
to describe your beauty?

19:01.808 --> 19:05.178
Like, a bowling ball,
fresh out of a polisher.

19:05.212 --> 19:06.145
Oh.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.680
I've always dreamed

19:07.714 --> 19:11.551
Homie would write me
cursive love letters.

19:16.923 --> 19:20.393
HOMER: You are as beautiful
as your sisters are hideous.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.729
Oh...

19:24.030 --> 19:26.032
*

19:28.668 --> 19:30.537
Oh, Homie.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.071
Mwah. Oh.

19:32.104 --> 19:34.641
I'm married to a writer.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.042
I really am.

19:36.075 --> 19:37.076
(snores)

19:43.250 --> 19:44.984
Welcome, all of you.

19:45.017 --> 19:46.986
You are the chosen people.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.389
Chosen to be my slaves.

19:49.422 --> 19:51.358
I am no one's slave.

19:51.391 --> 19:52.692
Well, doesn't matter
what you think.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.060
The doors are sealed.

19:54.093 --> 19:56.095
Not this one.

19:56.128 --> 19:59.031
Wait, wait, you haven't heard
about the retirement plan.

19:59.065 --> 20:01.501
There isn't one.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.902
Fine, I don't need them.

20:02.935 --> 20:04.571
I don't need anyone.

20:07.106 --> 20:11.344
Oh. Why did you have me go back
for your slippers?

20:11.378 --> 20:13.880
How could you turn on me
so quickly?

20:25.792 --> 20:29.796
