00:02.475 --> 00:03.809
Previously on
Damages:

00:03.810 --> 00:05.478
How long have you been
with me here?

00:05.479 --> 00:06.145
Almost 11 years.

00:06.146 --> 00:07.712
It's time to put your
name on the door.

00:07.713 --> 00:10.113
We're doing everything we
can to recover your funds.

00:10.181 --> 00:12.981
This follows Mr. Tobin's
confession to operating

00:12.982 --> 00:15.782
the largest Ponzi scheme
in Wall Street history.

00:15.849 --> 00:17.683
You're working
Narcotics at the D.A.?

00:17.684 --> 00:19.383
Patty can go after
the money.

00:19.384 --> 00:21.851
Chris here is going to put the
whole Tobin family behind bars.

00:21.918 --> 00:23.986
When was the last time
you spoke to Patty anyway?

00:24.054 --> 00:27.822
Almost a year ago. $70 billion
went through your husband's fund.

00:27.890 --> 00:29.790
He didn't tuck some of that
away for the family?

00:29.825 --> 00:31.958
I need you to tell me
everything you know.

00:32.026 --> 00:34.026
Thanksgiving night, who did he
call?

00:34.094 --> 00:35.928
You want the truth?
Here it is.

00:35.929 --> 00:39.997
If I give you this number, I want you
to tell the D.A. that I cooperated.

00:40.065 --> 00:43.234
My father didn't hide any
money. Man left us with nothing.

00:43.302 --> 00:45.037
- We've got money, Joe.
- What?

00:45.038 --> 00:47.673
We do.
It's out there.

00:50.477 --> 00:52.210
How much money?

00:52.211 --> 00:57.913
Enough for
generations.

01:00.082 --> 01:02.383
The whole world
is watching us.

01:02.451 --> 01:04.184
We could never spend it.

01:04.185 --> 01:09.922
It'll take some time.
But there is a way.

01:09.989 --> 01:12.723
I've made arrangements.

01:12.791 --> 01:17.460
When the time comes, someone
will let you know what to do.

01:17.528 --> 01:20.662
Or I could go to Patty
Hewes now.

01:20.730 --> 01:23.097
Tell her it's out there and
clear my name.

01:23.165 --> 01:26.200
I took a shit on our
name.

01:26.267 --> 01:28.235
I'm not proud of it.

01:28.302 --> 01:32.738
But it's done forever.

01:32.806 --> 01:37.475
Dad, why did you do it?

01:39.310 --> 01:46.148
There's...
no good answer, Joe.

01:46.216 --> 01:50.985
I'm sorry.

01:51.053 --> 01:54.821
I'm sorry, too.

01:54.889 --> 02:01.261
Think about it. How are you
going to take care of your family?

02:01.329 --> 02:09.602
Even if you go to Patty Hewes,
who's going to give you a job?

02:09.669 --> 02:14.372
Who's ever going to trust you?

02:14.440 --> 02:21.512
You have to decide:
your family or Patty Hewes.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:34.455 --> 02:37.624
- Yeah, hello?
-Hello?

02:37.691 --> 02:43.994
- Who is this?
- This is Patty Hewes. Who's this?

02:53.203 --> 02:56.070
Sorry to keep you
waiting.

02:56.138 --> 02:58.171
>> Well, the Welshman's back.

02:58.238 --> 03:00.503
Yeah.

03:00.571 --> 03:05.238
Just got a few more questions.

03:06.807 --> 03:09.975
Do you know this man?

04:00.447 --> 04:02.781
Let's see...
Item 4: the apartment.

04:02.849 --> 04:06.084
Appraised value as of last year:
$9.6 million.

04:06.152 --> 04:08.353
My client is willing to buy it
out at 80%.

04:08.421 --> 04:11.858
We're sorry, but the
apartment is not negotiable.

04:11.926 --> 04:13.761
All right, we'll
table it for now.

04:13.762 --> 04:15.097
Hold on.

04:15.098 --> 04:17.298
We've been stuck on the
apartment for seven months.

04:17.367 --> 04:19.668
There must be some way we can
settle this.

04:19.737 --> 04:22.139
We already have.
I'm not selling.

04:22.206 --> 04:24.341
I think the issue here
is that my client doesn't

04:24.342 --> 04:26.476
think of this as
just another asset.

04:26.544 --> 04:28.645
This is her home.
"Her home"?

04:28.713 --> 04:31.214
Your client doesn't know what a
home is.

04:31.282 --> 04:34.551
Obviously, the emotions
are still raw on this point.

04:34.619 --> 04:36.320
Perhaps we could table this
for later.

04:36.321 --> 04:39.290
Were you hoping to invite David
Pell to another dinner party?

04:39.357 --> 04:42.227
Half of Wall Street wanted Dave
Pell at their dinner parties.

04:42.294 --> 04:45.046
Well, now that he's
a convicted felon,

04:45.047 --> 04:47.798
I suppose your girlfriend is
your favorite dinner partner.

04:47.866 --> 04:50.734
You know what? I think
it's time to take a break.

04:50.802 --> 04:52.469
You really want to
start throwing stones?

04:52.470 --> 04:53.971
I have nothing to hide.

04:53.972 --> 04:54.972
Really?

04:54.973 --> 05:01.043
I wish I'd had a chance to ask
Ray Fiske about that.

05:05.251 --> 05:10.186
You are not getting
the apartment.

05:10.253 --> 05:12.153
I think we're done here
today.

05:12.155 --> 05:18.527
You better believe
we're done.

05:20.896 --> 05:21.729
Yeah, Tom?

05:21.730 --> 05:24.098
I found our mystery
phone call recipient.

05:24.166 --> 05:25.766
Is he willing to talk?

05:25.767 --> 05:27.602
For a price.

05:27.603 --> 05:32.206
What does he want?

05:32.274 --> 05:35.109
A hot lunch.

05:35.176 --> 05:38.408
There's money out there?

05:38.475 --> 05:42.403
That's what he said.

05:42.471 --> 05:44.866
Did you know
about this before?

05:44.934 --> 05:49.600
Of course not.

05:52.536 --> 05:57.139
I just can't understand
why he did it.

05:57.207 --> 06:00.041
Well, he's a good man.

06:00.109 --> 06:05.212
He just got caught
up in something.

06:05.280 --> 06:07.481
I don't know what
to do, Lenny.

06:07.549 --> 06:11.050
Joe, your father's
going to go to jail.

06:11.118 --> 06:13.889
Nothing I can do to stop that.

06:13.956 --> 06:18.559
So you, your mother, Carol...

06:18.627 --> 06:20.361
You're my priority now.

06:20.362 --> 06:25.431
Whatever you need, whatever decision
you make, you have my full support.

06:25.499 --> 06:30.002
I want to tell the truth.

06:30.070 --> 06:32.804
Help Patty Hewes get the
money back for the investors.

06:32.872 --> 06:36.076
Well, then we'll set it up.

06:36.143 --> 06:38.111
What about my mom?

06:38.178 --> 06:41.680
How's she going to live?

06:41.748 --> 06:43.682
I don't know.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.517
If I keep it and get caught,
I go to prison.

06:53.423 --> 06:54.790
Yes?

06:54.791 --> 06:56.758
Thanks, Liz.
It's for you.

06:56.825 --> 07:00.294
Who is it?
It's your wife.

07:00.362 --> 07:02.296
Hello?

07:02.363 --> 07:03.530
Hey.

07:03.531 --> 07:05.365
What?

07:05.366 --> 07:09.968
Slow down, honey.
Rachel, I can't under...

07:10.036 --> 07:12.970
When?

07:13.038 --> 07:15.238
I'll be right there.
We'll be right there.

07:15.306 --> 07:16.139
What's going on?

07:16.140 --> 07:19.373
They just seized our
apartment.

07:19.441 --> 07:21.675
Listen, this dump
site better exist.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.610
You're not getting your 50
if you're playing me.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.179
>> Hey, I didn't get where I am
by being dishonest.

07:26.247 --> 07:32.517
And it's not a dump site.
It's a Dumpster.

07:32.585 --> 07:34.552
You can't tell your friends
about this place.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.286
It's a gold mine.

07:36.287 --> 07:38.187
This is where you
found the phone?

07:38.190 --> 07:40.659
>> Not just a phone.

07:40.727 --> 07:46.765
Clothes, cigarettes, two
suitcases, lemon reamer...

07:46.832 --> 07:48.533
It's empty.

07:48.534 --> 07:52.170
>> Well, sure, now it is, but I
get new inventory all the time.

07:52.237 --> 07:55.906
Look at this.

08:05.247 --> 08:07.748
Those look sharp.

08:10.984 --> 08:12.284
What do you, uh...

08:12.285 --> 08:14.453
What do you say I buy these off
of you?

08:14.521 --> 08:16.187
>> No, dude.

08:16.188 --> 08:18.788
Those are special.

08:18.856 --> 08:20.956
Very special.

08:21.024 --> 08:21.757
Come on.

08:21.758 --> 08:22.591
What do you say?

08:22.592 --> 08:24.492
>> Nah, I already got the 50
coming.

08:24.493 --> 08:29.529
All right, what are
you thinking?

08:29.596 --> 08:32.297
>> Nice watch.

08:32.365 --> 08:36.100
Are you serious?

08:36.167 --> 08:38.134
Sorry to bother you.
I need the CPL.

08:38.202 --> 08:40.602
Just looking for a new code.

08:40.671 --> 08:43.438
You're a breath of fresh air.

08:43.506 --> 08:46.173
I just spent the last two hours
going through a list of names before

08:46.174 --> 08:48.841
I realized that it was the exact
same list I went through yesterday.

08:48.909 --> 08:50.710
What are you looking
for?

08:50.711 --> 08:52.877
Potential
witnesses.

08:52.945 --> 08:56.513
Tobin associates, investors, anyone
that can link the family to the fraud.

08:56.581 --> 08:58.615
Looks like you got your
work cut out for you.

08:58.682 --> 08:59.682
Yeah, I do.

08:59.683 --> 09:02.950
And you know what I would like
when I'm done?

09:03.018 --> 09:06.220
A beer.
Really?

09:07.589 --> 09:10.190
Well, you enjoy that.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.592
You're missing the point.

09:12.660 --> 09:14.093
I want to drink it with you.

09:14.094 --> 09:17.061
No, I got the point.

09:20.666 --> 09:23.966
They put yellow
stickers on all the furniture.

09:24.034 --> 09:27.902
They said we have
24 hours to get out.

09:27.970 --> 09:28.969
Who was there?

09:28.970 --> 09:29.970
I don't know.

09:29.971 --> 09:32.773
Policemen.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.675
>> Now, hold that.

09:34.676 --> 09:35.676
Now...

09:35.677 --> 09:37.681
I won't let things
get any worse for him.

09:37.749 --> 09:39.154
I'm taking him to my parents.

09:39.155 --> 09:40.190
No, no, you're not.

09:40.191 --> 09:40.859
Yes, I am.

09:40.860 --> 09:43.499
We're better off on our own
right now, away from your family.

09:43.567 --> 09:45.070
That's not your
decision to make.

09:45.071 --> 09:47.874
I don't want him in this chaos.
It's not safe; it's not healthy.

09:47.942 --> 09:54.378
I will find a place to ve. I will
make things normal again.

09:54.446 --> 09:58.515
you actually think this will
blow over someday?

09:58.583 --> 10:03.018
You know what your family's name
means in this world.

10:03.086 --> 10:05.454
You are his son.
You will always be his son.

10:05.521 --> 10:08.690
You cannot change that.

10:20.236 --> 10:23.204
Come on; come say good-bye.

10:26.142 --> 10:31.446
Let's try this
again.

10:31.513 --> 10:36.384
Do you know this man?

10:36.452 --> 10:38.920
>> Yeah, sure, that's Tommy.

10:38.988 --> 10:41.256
He's a good egg.

10:41.324 --> 10:43.225
I helped him; he helped me.

10:43.292 --> 10:45.727
Helped how?

10:45.795 --> 10:49.231
>> Well, that's not for
publication.

10:52.535 --> 10:55.870
Oh, so you...
keeping secrets?

10:55.937 --> 10:57.104
>> Girls have secrets.

10:57.105 --> 11:00.637
Men have honor.

11:00.705 --> 11:04.570
You left Tommy in
the Dumpster, didn't you?

11:06.404 --> 11:08.068
Louis Tobin's boots.

11:08.069 --> 11:10.969
Where did you get
those?

11:11.037 --> 11:13.721
Our residentially
challenged friend found them

11:13.722 --> 11:16.406
in the same Dumpster
he found the phe.

11:16.474 --> 11:19.842
I guess, uh, someone was anxious
to get rid of Tobin's things.

11:19.910 --> 11:22.578
Well, how do y know
they belong to Tobin?

11:22.646 --> 11:23.878
I traced the label.

11:23.879 --> 11:28.081
They were custom-made at an
Upper East Se boutique.

11:28.149 --> 11:30.449
"Louis Kenneth Tobin."

11:30.517 --> 11:33.386
The saleswoman said he also
ordered thousands of dollars'

11:33.387 --> 11:36.256
worth of women's clothing there.

11:36.324 --> 11:38.959
For his wife?
I don't think so.

11:39.026 --> 11:42.795
He ordered a $2,000 shearling
coat a few months back.

11:42.863 --> 11:46.331
Those are the intials he wanted
on it.

11:46.399 --> 11:47.399
"D.M.M."

11:47.400 --> 11:52.402
Which, incidentally, does
not stand for Marilyn Tobin.

11:52.470 --> 11:56.039
You think he had
another woman in his life.

11:56.106 --> 11:59.541
Yeah, I do, and she may
have been important enough

11:59.542 --> 12:02.977
to call the night his
life was falling apart.

12:09.520 --> 12:14.056
Come on, you gotta
eat something, all right?

12:16.926 --> 12:18.927
Oh, comen.

12:18.994 --> 12:23.830
You got this tummyache.
What's going on?

12:23.898 --> 12:27.901
Don't feel well?

12:35.574 --> 12:39.576
Thanks for coming.

12:41.813 --> 12:44.615
Can I get you anything?
Coffee?

12:44.682 --> 12:48.784
No, no.
I told you have a meeting.

12:48.852 --> 12:52.053
I remember when I first found
this place.

12:52.121 --> 12:53.687
Building was a shithole.

12:53.688 --> 12:57.123
Yes, but I made you
buy it anyway.

12:57.191 --> 12:59.091
And then, you hardly
ever lived here.

12:59.159 --> 13:00.726
Where's the dog, Patty?

13:00.727 --> 13:05.296
Right here.

13:05.364 --> 13:07.298
Hey, buddy.

13:07.365 --> 13:09.300
Hey.

13:09.367 --> 13:11.368
How's my buddy? Hmm?

13:11.436 --> 13:14.804
The vet doesn't think
there's anything wrong with him.

13:14.872 --> 13:16.772
He thinks it's emotional.

13:16.807 --> 13:18.508
I don't think it's
another infection.

13:18.509 --> 13:21.580
Yeah, but he has the same
loss of appetite, no energy.

13:21.647 --> 13:24.650
Well, you can try
the antibiotics again,

13:24.651 --> 13:27.653
but I don't think it's
worth the side effects.

13:27.721 --> 13:29.854
Let me know if
it gets any worse.

13:29.922 --> 13:31.856
All right.

13:31.924 --> 13:34.859
Good boy.

13:34.927 --> 13:36.660
Phil...

13:36.661 --> 13:39.615
With this new case, I'm
not going to be here much

13:39.616 --> 13:42.569
and I really don't feel
good about leaving him alone.

13:42.637 --> 13:43.836
I'm busy too.

13:43.837 --> 13:48.107
Yeah, but you're the only
other person he responds to.

13:48.175 --> 13:52.944
I really don't think he should
be left alone right now.

13:53.012 --> 13:56.146
All right, fine.
A couple days.

13:56.214 --> 14:00.317
Great. Thanks.

14:08.192 --> 14:09.526
Hello, Joe.

14:09.527 --> 14:10.993
Hey.

14:10.994 --> 14:11.896
I know. I know.

14:11.897 --> 14:13.132
It's been a couple of weeks.

14:13.133 --> 14:15.401
It's not a good time
to be missing meetings, Joe.

14:15.468 --> 14:16.635
Go back in the room.

14:16.636 --> 14:17.403
I know.

14:17.404 --> 14:19.839
I know, but I'm dealing with
some other shit right now, so...

14:19.907 --> 14:21.075
What kind of shit?

14:21.076 --> 14:23.677
It's not something I
can talk about.

14:23.745 --> 14:25.479
Don't come here and
keep secrets.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.514
If you're going to talk to me,
have some respect.

14:27.582 --> 14:29.183
All right, but this is
different.

14:29.184 --> 14:30.284
There's legal reasons and...

14:30.285 --> 14:34.321
"Legal reasons"?

14:34.388 --> 14:36.322
Okay.

14:36.390 --> 14:39.391
All right, listen.

14:43.128 --> 14:45.063
I have to make a decision.

14:45.130 --> 14:50.234
Are you going to have
a drink to help you make it?

14:50.302 --> 14:55.004
No.

14:55.072 --> 14:57.875
So tell me about your
decision.

14:57.943 --> 14:58.776
I don't know.

14:58.777 --> 15:01.411
It's going to sound like
a stupid riddle.

15:01.479 --> 15:09.452
Say you're in a lifeboat and it's
full of people with not enough food.

15:09.520 --> 15:11.087
Who do you feed?

15:11.088 --> 15:13.656
Your wife? Your neighbor?

15:13.724 --> 15:14.391
The priest?

15:14.392 --> 15:16.926
I would not feed the
priest.

15:16.994 --> 15:19.228
I know.

15:19.296 --> 15:23.799
I mean, what are
you supposed to do?

15:23.866 --> 15:26.768
Give up your life for people
you don't know?

15:26.836 --> 15:28.671
What is important
to you?

15:28.672 --> 15:30.306
What matters most to you?

15:30.307 --> 15:32.675
Is it family, integrity...?

15:32.743 --> 15:33.710
My family.

15:33.711 --> 15:35.544
Well, then you have
your answer.

15:35.545 --> 15:39.647
If family's the most important,
then choose family.

15:39.715 --> 15:46.512
You're only as happy as your
saddest child, Joe.

15:54.316 --> 15:57.580
Roger, could you
check your investor data?

15:57.648 --> 16:00.514
I'm looking for someone with
the initials D.M.M.

16:00.580 --> 16:02.079
I think it's a woman.

16:02.080 --> 16:02.912
"D.M.M."?

16:02.913 --> 16:03.578
Yeah, sure.

16:03.579 --> 16:06.210
Thanks.

16:08.809 --> 16:11.905
Tom, I...

16:11.973 --> 16:15.899
I, uh...

16:15.967 --> 16:17.199
I'm sorry.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.532
I- I-I don't know how to say
this.

16:20.600 --> 16:23.267
Say what?

16:55.495 --> 17:00.165
Don't tell Patty about this.

17:13.441 --> 17:18.476
What'd y find ou Guy's
wife ID'd his body.

17:18.544 --> 17:20.077
R. Thomas Shayes.

17:20.078 --> 17:22.445
Same guy who owned the
car that hit Ms. Hewes.

17:22.512 --> 17:26.415
Yeah, they-they're partners
in a law firm.

17:26.483 --> 17:28.717
Oh, boy.

17:28.784 --> 17:32.219
Think she had anything
to do with this?

17:32.287 --> 17:34.620
I don't know.

17:38.424 --> 17:43.193
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to seize my home?

17:43.261 --> 17:44.328
Are you surprised?

17:44.329 --> 17:46.495
We're not in this
together, you know.

17:46.563 --> 17:47.563
I helped you.

17:47.564 --> 17:50.298
I... I brought you information.

17:50.366 --> 17:53.200
And then you take my apartment?

17:53.268 --> 17:59.237
Thousands of people lost everything
because of your father's fraud.

17:59.304 --> 18:02.138
Your apartment was purchased
with proceeds from that fraud.

18:02.206 --> 18:04.773
How else am I going to start
paying them back?

18:04.841 --> 18:09.143
All right, if...

18:09.210 --> 18:12.044
if I can get you more information,
would you be willing to help me?

18:12.112 --> 18:14.079
Well, what kind
of information?

18:14.147 --> 18:19.182
Once my father goes to prison,
Ms. Hewes, you hit a wall.

18:19.250 --> 18:21.651
He will not give you anything.

18:21.719 --> 18:26.454
Whereas you'll still have access. H
- He, he trusts me.

18:26.522 --> 18:31.624
Maybe I can get you some details, but
if I do, I want something in return.

18:31.692 --> 18:33.059
What's that?

18:33.060 --> 18:36.560
Unfreeze my assets.

18:36.628 --> 18:39.462
I have a family, Ms. Hewes, and
I- I'm going to lose them.

18:39.530 --> 18:42.664
I'm not here to make a
deal.

18:42.732 --> 18:47.284
No one's connected
you to your father yet,

18:47.285 --> 18:49.561
so maybe you didn't
know what was going on,

18:49.562 --> 18:51.837
but when I look at
you, all I see is guilt.

18:51.905 --> 18:53.005
You're wrong.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.874
Look at the life your
family was living.

18:55.942 --> 18:58.509
You must have known it
was too good to be true.

18:58.577 --> 19:01.895
If you're as close to your
father as you say you are,

19:01.896 --> 19:05.213
you must have known deep
down what he was capable of.

19:05.281 --> 19:09.249
I have nothing to offer you,
Mr. Tobin.

19:09.317 --> 19:14.152
Whether you clear your conscience
or not, that's up to you.

19:26.660 --> 19:28.592
You okay?

19:28.660 --> 19:29.759
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.660
Just, uh...

19:32.228 --> 19:34.796
Charlie's, you know, not
sleeping like a ten-month-old.

19:35.864 --> 19:38.999
Have we found the
other woman in Tobin's life yet?

19:39.067 --> 19:44.137
There's no one with the initials
D.M.M. in Tobin's extended family;

19:44.205 --> 19:46.540
she's not a former employee;

19:46.541 --> 19:48.875
she doesn't hold any
investment accounts;

19:48.943 --> 19:51.677
and she's not associated with
any financial institution.

19:51.745 --> 19:53.913
I'm afraid I've... I've hit a
wall.

19:53.981 --> 19:56.949
So D.M.M. doesn't show
up anywhere?

19:57.017 --> 20:02.186
I'm sorry.
I- I know this is our only lead.

20:02.254 --> 20:04.622
Figure it out, Tom.

20:12.629 --> 20:17.098
This bag I found in
your shopping cart

20:17.099 --> 20:21.567
- you're going to tell
me where you got this.

20:21.635 --> 20:22.835
>> I can't really say.

20:22.836 --> 20:29.239
I find a lot of things in a lot
of different places.

20:29.307 --> 20:34.847
And then... tell me
about this.

20:38.951 --> 20:48.224
We found that in the bag.
You know this woman?

20:48.292 --> 20:50.293
>> Yeah, I seen her.

20:50.360 --> 20:54.364
She's the one you should be
looking for.

20:54.431 --> 20:57.999
Yeah, why's that?

20:58.067 --> 21:01.066
>> Her and Tommy- they...

21:01.134 --> 21:05.604
had a thing going on.

21:05.672 --> 21:07.572
Hey.

21:07.573 --> 21:08.806
Twice in two weeks.

21:08.807 --> 21:10.707
You must miss me.

21:12.143 --> 21:13.743
Coffee, black.

21:13.744 --> 21:14.744
You?

21:14.745 --> 21:20.314
Uh, milk and sugar,
thanks.

21:20.382 --> 21:21.814
What's up?

21:21.815 --> 21:23.814
I need your help.

21:23.882 --> 21:24.914
Sure.

21:24.915 --> 21:25.915
Wh do you need?

21:25.916 --> 21:26.716
It's about the Tobin

21:26.717 --> 21:27.717
case.

21:27.718 --> 21:29.618
You know I can't
help you with that.

21:29.654 --> 21:31.189
Sure, you can.

21:31.190 --> 21:32.790
Interjurisdictional cooperation.

21:32.791 --> 21:35.625
I'm not even working
the Tobin case.

21:35.693 --> 21:38.693
I'm sure you know
someone in your office who is.

21:38.761 --> 21:40.561
Are you really
asking me this?

21:40.562 --> 21:43.798
Yeah.

21:43.866 --> 21:46.467
Why doesn't Patty
just call the D.A.?

21:46.535 --> 21:48.435
I'm sure he'd be happy to
cooperate.

21:48.470 --> 21:50.137
Come on, you know
they have competing agendas.

21:50.138 --> 21:53.907
We tip you guys off, you're not going
to wait for us to get what we want.

21:53.975 --> 21:56.542
You'll start pursuing it...

21:56.610 --> 21:59.545
That'll scare our target off.

22:01.714 --> 22:03.648
"D.M.M."

22:03.716 --> 22:05.182
What's that?

22:05.183 --> 22:06.183
Initials.

22:06.184 --> 22:08.552
So you want to find
who they belong to.

22:08.619 --> 22:09.686
How do I even do that?

22:09.687 --> 22:10.753
We're limited to

22:10.754 --> 22:12.155
finance-related information.

22:12.156 --> 22:14.056
Your office has a broader scope.

22:14.123 --> 22:16.691
That name has got to be in there
somewhere.

22:16.758 --> 22:18.992
Tom, I left Hewes &
Associates for a reason.

22:19.060 --> 22:21.160
Look, the D.A. wants
to put the Tobins away, right?

22:21.228 --> 22:22.295
They want to put 'em in jail?

22:22.296 --> 22:26.464
Fine, let him do it; that's his
job, but if he locks them up now,

22:26.465 --> 22:30.633
the victims are not going
to get their money back.

22:30.701 --> 22:31.833
I'm sorry, Tom.

22:31.834 --> 22:34.368
I... I can't.

22:37.570 --> 22:44.106
Ellen, I'm not just
asking as a friend.

22:44.174 --> 22:46.408
What do you mean?

22:49.344 --> 22:51.011
Fetch.

22:51.012 --> 22:52.912
Good, good.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.114
Good.

22:54.115 --> 22:56.281
I thought you weren't a dog
person.

22:56.349 --> 22:59.282
I wasn't, but look
how happy he is.

23:00.351 --> 23:01.519
He likes you.

23:01.520 --> 23:05.155
Look, fetch.

23:05.223 --> 23:06.390
We should keep him.

23:06.391 --> 23:07.391
Oh, yeah, sure.

23:07.392 --> 23:08.058
What?

23:08.059 --> 23:12.630
Yeah, we could do that if we want Patty to
hunt us down and use us for ground chuck.

23:12.698 --> 23:13.798
Patty asked you to

23:13.799 --> 23:14.798
take him.

23:14.799 --> 23:15.865
She's basically admitting it.

23:15.866 --> 23:17.935
The dog is happier without her.

23:18.003 --> 23:19.039
I don't think that's

23:19.040 --> 23:20.878
why Patty asked me.

23:20.879 --> 23:22.148
Why, then?

23:22.149 --> 23:23.782
Another manipulation?

23:23.783 --> 23:30.093
You think she's trying to soften you
up so you'll give her the apartment?

23:30.161 --> 23:31.595
Maybe.

23:31.596 --> 23:37.233
Even if she is, the dog
is yours, too. Fetch.

23:37.301 --> 23:38.534
I've seen the way you've been

23:38.535 --> 23:39.902
the past few days.

23:39.903 --> 23:41.870
You're more relaxed with Corey
around.

23:41.938 --> 23:44.573
All right, all right,
maybe I'll ask Patty.

23:44.640 --> 23:45.840
Take a stand, Phil.

23:45.841 --> 23:49.076
Just tell her.

23:49.144 --> 23:51.044
You're keeping the dog.

23:53.981 --> 23:57.349
I want the money.

23:57.417 --> 24:00.419
Good.

24:00.487 --> 24:02.888
Who else knows about it?

24:02.955 --> 24:04.455
No one.

24:04.456 --> 24:06.123
Mom doesn't know?

24:06.124 --> 24:08.826
Just you and me.

24:08.893 --> 24:11.027
No, I told Lenny.

24:11.095 --> 24:15.364
He's the one person I trust.

24:15.432 --> 24:20.102
Listen, I need for this to be
done in a certain way, so...

24:20.170 --> 24:21.670
I don't want to know anything.

24:21.671 --> 24:23.571
I don't want to know details
about the fraud.

24:23.573 --> 24:25.307
I don't want to know where the
money is.

24:25.308 --> 24:29.377
I don't want to know where
you're hiding it.

24:29.445 --> 24:31.378
So I can deny everything.

24:31.446 --> 24:33.413
That's how it should
be.

24:33.481 --> 24:39.350
From today on, we don't
speak to each other again...

24:39.418 --> 24:41.585
until we can safely access the
money.

24:41.653 --> 24:44.521
When that day comes, you
contact me through Lenny,

24:44.522 --> 24:47.389
and we have another
conversation.

24:47.457 --> 24:48.456
Okay.

24:48.457 --> 24:53.459
I'll learn the relevant details, and
I'll decide how to begin doling it out.

24:53.527 --> 24:55.428
Promise me you'll
take care of everyone.

24:55.496 --> 24:58.900
I'm not doing
this for me, Dad.

24:58.968 --> 25:00.868
Thanks, Joe.

25:00.935 --> 25:03.436
Don't thank me.

25:03.503 --> 25:08.073
There's still another... issue.

25:08.141 --> 25:13.379
Mom gave me the phone
number you called on Thanksgiving.

25:13.447 --> 25:16.216
I gave it to Patty Hewes.

25:19.453 --> 25:21.421
What, is that a problem?

25:21.488 --> 25:22.489
No, no.

25:22.490 --> 25:23.490
No, it's okay.

25:23.491 --> 25:25.125
That can't hurt us.

25:25.126 --> 25:26.159
You sure?

25:26.160 --> 25:29.562
Yeah, I'm sure.

25:29.629 --> 25:32.331
But Joe...

25:32.399 --> 25:33.832
I should tell you who I phoned.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.733
No, I just told you...

25:35.735 --> 25:39.104
whatever you did, you keep me
out of it.

25:39.172 --> 25:41.406
I don't want to know.

25:45.478 --> 25:48.346
So, this is why you
agreed to come out with me.

25:48.414 --> 25:51.115
I wouldn't ask if it
wasn't important.

25:51.183 --> 25:52.583
It's for a friend.

25:52.584 --> 25:54.635
You really think you're going
to be able to find whatever

25:54.636 --> 25:56.687
it is you're looking for
in all that paperwork?

25:56.754 --> 25:58.655
Maybe not, but...

25:58.723 --> 26:01.186
if you could at least let me
have a look.

26:01.253 --> 26:05.219
This guy must be
a very good friend.

26:05.287 --> 26:06.620
I owe him.

26:06.621 --> 26:11.423
He doesn't happen to work
for, uh, Patty Hewes, does he?

26:11.490 --> 26:14.359
Look, Nick, our office is supposed
to be cooperating with hers.

26:14.426 --> 26:15.293
Yeah, tell that to

26:15.294 --> 26:16.193
Gates.

26:16.194 --> 26:18.095
He's paranoid she's going to
screw up his criminal case.

26:18.163 --> 26:20.297
I don't care about
their ego battle.

26:20.365 --> 26:22.766
I just want to help a friend.

26:22.834 --> 26:26.503
And if I need some
info from this friend someday...

26:26.571 --> 26:30.907
I'm sure he'll be
very grateful.

26:30.975 --> 26:32.942
This can't get back
to me.

26:33.009 --> 26:33.976
Never.

26:33.977 --> 26:37.478
I swear.

26:37.546 --> 26:40.379
All right.

26:40.447 --> 26:43.048
I'll let you take a look.

26:43.116 --> 26:44.383
Thanks.

26:44.384 --> 26:46.884
Thank you.

26:54.225 --> 26:55.959
>> Did you talk to the girl?

26:55.960 --> 27:02.665
Unfortunately for you, we haven't
been able to get in touch with her.

27:02.733 --> 27:05.634
What's up?

27:08.138 --> 27:10.973
NYPD say possible
homicide.

27:11.041 --> 27:12.941
Tom Shayes.

27:13.009 --> 27:16.913
You know him, don't
you?

27:16.980 --> 27:19.715
Ellen.

27:19.783 --> 27:22.986
Elle you okay?

27:37.866 --> 27:39.433
This came for you.

27:39.434 --> 27:43.236
What, are you, uh,
making deliveries now?

27:43.304 --> 27:48.207
It's from the District
Attorney's office.

27:48.275 --> 27:53.078
You planning on entering the
civil service?

27:56.382 --> 27:59.617
You went to Ellen.
Didn't you?

27:59.685 --> 28:00.518
I'm sorry.

28:00.519 --> 28:01.653
I wasn't getting anywhere.

28:01.654 --> 28:02.587
Don't apologize.

28:02.588 --> 28:05.590
Why not use Ellen?

28:09.995 --> 28:12.330
She come through for you?

28:12.398 --> 28:15.700
She did.

28:15.768 --> 28:17.301
D.M.M.:

28:17.302 --> 28:20.972
Danielle Maria Marchetti.

28:21.039 --> 28:24.542
Let's have another
chat with Joe Tobin.

28:24.609 --> 28:26.610
Thank you for coming to see us.

28:26.678 --> 28:30.614
Any-anything I can do to
help.

28:30.682 --> 28:36.253
Do you know a Danielle
Marchetti?

28:36.321 --> 28:37.821
No.

28:37.822 --> 28:39.590
Why? Should I?

28:39.591 --> 28:42.777
Well, in the past year and
a half, your father purchased

28:42.778 --> 28:45.963
$14,000 worth of clothes
for Miss Marchetti.

28:46.030 --> 28:48.298
What?

28:48.366 --> 28:49.666
Who is she?

28:49.667 --> 28:52.202
Well, that's what
we'd like to know.

28:52.270 --> 28:57.640
We believe that she's the person your
father called on Thanksgiving night.

28:59.844 --> 29:03.012
You think she's connected to the
fraud somehow?

29:03.080 --> 29:04.947
We're looking into
that.

29:04.948 --> 29:07.733
Miss Marchetti was
the receptionist at the

29:07.734 --> 29:10.518
health club where your
father played squash.

29:14.122 --> 29:16.357
Is that all you know about her?

29:16.425 --> 29:19.427
I'm afraid so.

29:27.669 --> 29:29.770
Mr. Tobin.

29:29.838 --> 29:34.841
Are you sure there's nothing
else that you can tell us?

29:34.909 --> 29:36.442
No.

29:36.443 --> 29:38.277
No, I'm sorry.

29:38.278 --> 29:43.648
I...
I wish there was.

29:46.419 --> 29:49.153
Hey, Tom.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.488
Hey.

29:50.489 --> 29:51.622
Ellen.

29:51.623 --> 29:54.024
Wanted to see how
you were.

29:54.092 --> 29:59.901
Uh, I'm... I'm still kind of
reeling, but thank you for your help.

29:59.969 --> 30:01.338
Sure, I...

30:01.339 --> 30:03.574
I just... I can't believe
this happened.

30:03.642 --> 30:05.577
Yeah, neither...
neither can I.

30:05.645 --> 30:07.380
Did you tell Patty
yet?

30:07.381 --> 30:08.965
No, she'll pull
me from the case if

30:08.966 --> 30:10.617
she thinks I'm on
a personal vendetta.

30:10.618 --> 30:11.818
Okay.

30:11.819 --> 30:13.986
Did the name I got you-
did it help?

30:14.054 --> 30:17.123
Yeah, thank you.
It could be a big break.

30:17.190 --> 30:18.691
Did you find her?

30:18.692 --> 30:20.158
Look, um, I'm sorry.

30:20.159 --> 30:24.095
I
- I don't mean to be rude, but, uh, I... I have to get going.

30:24.162 --> 30:26.930
Well, where are you headed?

30:26.998 --> 30:31.835
Just got to tell my wife
that we've lost everything.

30:34.072 --> 30:36.976
But that's not what our
broker statement says.

30:37.043 --> 30:39.479
No, but the next one will.

30:39.547 --> 30:40.480
I- I don't understand.

30:40.481 --> 30:42.416
We never invested
with Louis Tobin.

30:42.484 --> 30:46.121
No, but we were heavily invested
with Leverett Investments.

30:46.188 --> 30:48.890
Leverett is a
feeder fund to Tobin.

30:48.958 --> 30:50.492
I- I don't know what
that means.

30:50.493 --> 30:51.393
What...

30:51.394 --> 30:53.896
It means that we gave
our money to Leverett,

30:53.897 --> 30:56.399
and Leverett gave it to Tobin.

30:56.467 --> 30:58.401
You never told me that.

30:58.469 --> 31:00.035
I didn't know, okay?

31:00.036 --> 31:02.472
Legally, they're not required
to tell us.

31:02.539 --> 31:03.973
How is that possible?

31:03.974 --> 31:06.308
How? I don't know.
I don't know, you know.

31:06.376 --> 31:09.058
Two decades
of-of deregulation

31:09.059 --> 31:11.741
and-and the SEC having
its head up its ass.

31:11.808 --> 31:12.808
I don't know!

31:12.809 --> 31:15.243
Tom, you told my parents
to invest in Leverett.

31:15.311 --> 31:17.211
You helped them get into the
fund.

31:17.213 --> 31:19.146
I helped my parents
get into the fund!

31:19.214 --> 31:21.582
And my cousins and my aunts and
my uncles and everybody!

31:21.650 --> 31:23.483
You said it was a sure
thing.

31:23.484 --> 31:25.384
Everybody in New York
wanted to get in, okay?

31:25.419 --> 31:29.955
Jesus, why do you think I put
our funds in there?!

31:30.023 --> 31:32.625
Hey, Mom, I need this
form signed for school.

31:32.693 --> 31:37.195
Megan, we're talking.
Can't you see that?

31:37.263 --> 31:39.597
Shut the door.

31:42.234 --> 31:47.138
Do not take it out on
her.

31:47.205 --> 31:50.975
What are we going to do?

32:03.756 --> 32:08.260
I'm so sorry, Deb.

32:08.327 --> 32:13.064
I know this is a
horrible time, but...

32:13.132 --> 32:16.600
I really need to know.

32:16.668 --> 32:19.670
Who else knew about Tom and me?

32:24.620 --> 32:26.054
Come in.

32:26.055 --> 32:27.822
Look who's home.

32:27.823 --> 32:31.759
Corey!
Corey, come here, boy.

32:31.827 --> 32:34.095
Come here.

32:34.163 --> 32:35.330
Good boy!

32:35.331 --> 32:39.000
Come here, you good dog.
Oh, you're a miracle worker.

32:39.069 --> 32:40.969
Nothing a little TLC
couldn't fix.

32:40.972 --> 32:42.872
I love seeing you
again.

32:43.809 --> 32:46.643
He really took to my new place, or
maybe it was just being around my things.

32:46.711 --> 32:52.582
Oh, speaking of which, I've been going
through the apartment, getting rid of junk.

32:52.649 --> 32:54.617
I found this in a cabinet.

32:54.685 --> 32:57.154
Didn't know if it was yours.

32:57.222 --> 32:59.456
You don't remember,
do you?

32:59.524 --> 33:01.024
What?

33:01.025 --> 33:02.793
I brought this back
from Paris.

33:02.794 --> 33:04.694
It was a gift from Mitterrand.

33:06.930 --> 33:09.934
We were going to save this for a
very big occasion.

33:10.001 --> 33:12.736
What kind of an
occasion?

33:12.804 --> 33:16.240
You and I were going to drink
this when Michael got into college.

33:17.509 --> 33:20.544
So much for that.

33:20.612 --> 33:22.512
Mmm.

33:22.547 --> 33:24.481
Keep it.

33:24.549 --> 33:26.750
Well, I'll never drink
it.

33:26.817 --> 33:27.917
Well, I don't want it.

33:27.918 --> 33:30.820
It would feel wrong to drink it
with anybody else.

33:30.888 --> 33:32.322
Okay.

33:32.323 --> 33:33.690
I'll just toss it.

33:33.691 --> 33:35.825
No, no, no, no.

33:35.893 --> 33:39.795
Don't you dare.

33:39.863 --> 33:43.166
So, they know about
Danielle.

33:43.234 --> 33:45.735
Were you sleeping with
her?

33:45.803 --> 33:47.403
Huh?

33:47.404 --> 33:49.471
Were you sleeping with her?

33:49.539 --> 33:50.606
Don't answer.

33:50.607 --> 33:53.175
I don't want to hear any more
of your lies.

33:53.243 --> 33:54.977
I'm ashamed.

33:54.978 --> 33:56.178
You should be.

33:56.179 --> 33:58.313
I never meant for any
of this to happen.

33:58.381 --> 33:59.748
You know, I think back-

33:59.749 --> 34:01.282
everything you ever said to me,

34:01.283 --> 34:03.051
everything you've ever done,

34:03.052 --> 34:05.152
everything you ever were.

34:05.220 --> 34:07.955
I'm sorry.

34:08.023 --> 34:10.991
You're sorry?

34:13.795 --> 34:19.433
Danielle's not somewhere Patty
Hewes can find her, is she?

34:19.501 --> 34:21.268
Huh?

34:21.268 --> 34:21.835
What?

34:21.837 --> 34:23.469
Did you put her up somewhere?

34:23.471 --> 34:24.670
Did you buy her an apartment?

34:24.672 --> 34:25.572
Joe.

34:25.572 --> 34:28.440
Where is she?

34:28.509 --> 34:30.109
Patty will never
find her.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.745
Where is she?

34:32.812 --> 34:35.681
She's staying at
your sister's old place.

34:43.156 --> 34:46.091
And you're sure she doesn't know
about the money?

34:46.158 --> 34:49.226
She knows nothing.

34:51.830 --> 34:54.031
Good.

35:09.374 --> 35:12.610
What happened?

35:12.678 --> 35:17.486
Patty Hewes told him
about Danielle.

35:17.554 --> 35:20.428
How'd he take it?

35:20.496 --> 35:23.098
Not good.

35:23.165 --> 35:26.434
Talk to him the
way you do, will ya?

35:26.502 --> 35:28.870
Get him to calm down.

35:28.938 --> 35:30.838
I will.

35:33.509 --> 35:37.179
We can't let Patty
Hewes subpoena her.

35:37.246 --> 35:40.415
What do you want
me to do?

35:40.482 --> 35:43.251
Get her out of the
country.

35:45.020 --> 35:47.089
You thinking of
remodeling?

35:47.156 --> 35:49.056
Yeah, it's been so
long.

35:49.058 --> 35:51.159
I'm just tired of all this
stuff.

35:51.227 --> 35:53.195
Well, it's not yours
to remodel.

35:53.263 --> 35:55.231
The apartment is still in our
name.

35:55.298 --> 35:57.600
What are you going
to do? Sue me?

35:57.668 --> 36:00.204
That's what I like about you.
You're always so tough.

36:00.271 --> 36:03.109
You never back down.
I hate a weak woman.

36:03.177 --> 36:05.077
Well, that's all
about your mother.

36:07.849 --> 36:11.819
Oh, yes.

36:11.887 --> 36:14.422
You know what?

36:14.490 --> 36:16.058
Take the apartment.

36:16.059 --> 36:16.992
You're drunk.

36:16.993 --> 36:18.027
No.

36:18.028 --> 36:21.097
Yes, I am, but I mean it.

36:21.164 --> 36:22.965
You're at home here.

36:22.966 --> 36:25.000
It's not the four walls that
were home to me.

36:25.068 --> 36:28.638
It was you, and it was Michael
and...

36:28.706 --> 36:31.741
...and now that, there's no
point anymore.

36:31.809 --> 36:32.676
So, take it.

36:32.677 --> 36:35.679
Take it.

36:35.747 --> 36:37.816
Well, thank you, Phil.

36:37.884 --> 36:39.919
Sure.

36:39.987 --> 36:43.841
But, you know, having spent
some time with Corey got me

36:43.842 --> 36:47.695
thinking that there's something
that I'd like in exchange.

36:47.762 --> 36:50.564
What's that?

36:50.631 --> 36:55.869
Would you be willing
to consider...

36:55.937 --> 36:58.772
...giving us another shot?

37:04.411 --> 37:05.711
What?

37:05.712 --> 37:07.313
That's funny?

37:07.314 --> 37:09.214
I mean, why not?

37:09.282 --> 37:11.850
I mean, you and I made a damn
good couple.

37:11.918 --> 37:13.652
We had a great life together.

37:13.653 --> 37:16.088
Didn't we?

37:16.156 --> 37:18.590
You're serious.

37:18.658 --> 37:26.933
Yes.

37:30.104 --> 37:32.106
What?

37:32.173 --> 37:33.140
Oh, God, Phil.

37:33.141 --> 37:35.276
What's the point?

37:35.344 --> 37:40.149
Michael's out of the house
and you were a great father...

37:40.216 --> 37:42.451
but I don't need you anymore.

37:42.519 --> 37:45.655
And I certainly don't want you.

38:05.313 --> 38:07.832
If you're really looking
for companionship,

38:07.833 --> 38:10.351
I can give you the
name of a great breeder.

38:34.173 --> 38:38.037
Hello, Danielle.

38:38.103 --> 38:40.870
I don't think
your father would want you here.

38:40.938 --> 38:43.269
Oh, I'm sure he
wouldn't.

38:43.337 --> 38:45.704
Joe, Joe!

38:46.905 --> 38:48.570
Wow.

38:48.571 --> 38:51.070
What are you doing?

38:51.138 --> 38:53.038
What do you want?

38:53.039 --> 38:58.105
What do I want?

38:58.173 --> 39:01.340
I want... I want to know.

39:01.407 --> 39:03.674
All right, Joe,
seriously, you need to leave.

39:03.741 --> 39:05.339
How did it all start,
Danielle?

39:05.340 --> 39:07.240
Was it the old Tobin charm or...

39:07.272 --> 39:08.104
Get out.

39:08.105 --> 39:09.471
Did he throw money at
you right away?

39:09.472 --> 39:10.338
Get out!

39:10.339 --> 39:12.705
Jesus Christ, that's...
that's beautiful.

39:12.773 --> 39:13.772
When was this taken?

39:13.773 --> 39:16.706
This is... this is adorable.

39:16.774 --> 39:18.841
How long has it been going on,
Danielle, hmm?

39:18.908 --> 39:20.409
I'm calling the
police.

39:20.410 --> 39:21.543
How long?

39:21.544 --> 39:22.676
How long?!

39:22.677 --> 39:23.376
Do you really

39:23.377 --> 39:24.109
want me to give them your name?

39:24.110 --> 39:26.577
How long?!

39:26.645 --> 39:27.345
Hang up.

39:27.346 --> 39:29.046
Hang up. Hang up!

39:29.047 --> 39:33.984
I'm leaving.

39:41.558 --> 39:45.360
Glad everything worked out for
you.

39:56.103 --> 39:57.637
You were right.

39:57.638 --> 39:58.838
Joe Tobin was lying to us.

39:58.839 --> 40:00.106
You confirmed it?

40:00.107 --> 40:02.674
Your contact at the
State Department got back to me.

40:02.742 --> 40:05.174
Danielle Marchetti applied for
an expedited passport.

40:05.242 --> 40:08.338
So, Joe must have tipped off
his father that we're onto her.

40:08.406 --> 40:09.937
Yeah, and the
passport came through.

40:09.938 --> 40:14.128
If we don't find Marchetti, she's
going to be able to travel tonight.

40:14.195 --> 40:17.192
Cassie?

40:27.563 --> 40:29.463
Oh, goddamn it!

40:31.732 --> 40:33.732
Shit.

40:52.412 --> 40:54.712
We've got more on
Tom Shayes.

40:54.780 --> 40:57.914
The M.E. sent over his
preliminary report.

41:04.154 --> 41:05.253
Three wounds.

41:05.254 --> 41:08.855
One on the left thigh...

41:08.923 --> 41:12.457
two on the lower right abdomen.

41:12.525 --> 41:13.358
They have a read on

41:13.359 --> 41:14.192
the weapon?

41:14.193 --> 41:16.327
Not yet.

41:16.395 --> 41:17.194
>> HUNTLEYSo, what?

41:17.195 --> 41:19.229
Was his femoral artery hit?

41:19.297 --> 41:20.997
That's the thing,
Vic.

41:20.998 --> 41:24.300
None of these wounds were fatal.

41:24.368 --> 41:27.702
There was no organ damage,
no severed arteries.

41:27.770 --> 41:28.503
Okay, then...

41:28.504 --> 41:31.338
Then what killed him?

41:35.609 --> 41:38.342
He drowned.

41:39.305 --> 41:45.680
