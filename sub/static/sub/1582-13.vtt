Neptune--
eighth planet from the sun.

00:27.565 --> 00:30.600
A mystery now, we hope
to have close-up photos

00:30.635 --> 00:32.134
from <i>Voyager 2</i>

00:32.168 --> 00:34.537
in 1989.

00:34.572 --> 00:36.239
We do have them!

00:36.274 --> 00:37.707
They're my home screen!

00:37.742 --> 00:40.277
Miss Hoover, once again,
the lesson plan <i>I</i> prepared

00:40.311 --> 00:42.245
would have covered
this topic much better.

00:42.280 --> 00:43.780
But I can see...

00:46.851 --> 00:48.151
Miss Hoover?

00:48.185 --> 00:49.986
It's Tuesday, Lisa.

00:50.021 --> 00:51.421
<i>Taco</i> Tuesday.

00:52.957 --> 00:53.890
Huh?

00:53.925 --> 00:54.891
Huh?

00:56.127 --> 00:59.296
Taco Tuesday! Taco Tuesday!

00:59.330 --> 01:01.798
Taco Tuesday!

01:01.832 --> 01:06.069
Taco Tuesday, Taco Tuesday...

01:07.171 --> 01:09.239
Oh, no. I'm about to become

01:09.273 --> 01:11.574
another moppin' statistic.

01:14.145 --> 01:17.147
There's only room
for one of us, Ethel.

01:35.266 --> 01:37.334
Bart, that's
your sixth taco.

01:37.368 --> 01:39.903
You know, Whitman says,
"If anything is sacred,

01:39.937 --> 01:41.938
the human body is sacred."

01:41.973 --> 01:44.541
Fascinating.

01:45.376 --> 01:46.509
Congratulations, boys.

01:46.544 --> 01:47.978
You made it through

01:48.012 --> 01:50.013
another Taco Tuesday.

01:50.047 --> 01:52.349
Back in the bucket
till next week.

01:52.383 --> 01:54.718
Won't those
vegetables go bad?

01:54.752 --> 01:57.988
Nope. They're genetically
modified to stay fresh.

01:58.022 --> 02:00.390
Just don't ask
how old the Jell-O is.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.359
Ew.

02:03.928 --> 02:05.929
Overreactor.org
warns that over half

02:05.963 --> 02:08.732
of the vegetables
sold in this country are

02:08.765 --> 02:11.368
genetically modified organisms

02:11.402 --> 02:13.103
whose effect on humans is...

02:13.137 --> 02:14.871
unknown.

02:16.007 --> 02:19.275
Whoa! Mom,
you made me overswipe!

02:19.310 --> 02:22.545
Your parents' credit card
has been charged $20.

02:24.682 --> 02:26.583
I have to
get to the church.

02:26.617 --> 02:29.452
Helen Lovejoy is posting the
spring volunteer sign-up sheet.

02:29.487 --> 02:32.889
In five minutes, every
good task will be taken.

02:32.923 --> 02:34.190
Dang it!

02:36.427 --> 02:37.727
Jasper Beardley!

02:37.762 --> 02:39.396
You'll never make it!

02:43.701 --> 02:45.001
No!

02:52.443 --> 02:54.210
Ooh...

03:01.952 --> 03:03.053
Oh!

03:05.222 --> 03:06.756
What the hell is this thing?

03:08.359 --> 03:09.492
Bake sale-- taken.

03:09.527 --> 03:11.528
Candle snuffing-- taken.

03:11.562 --> 03:14.431
Baby shusher,
miscellaneous choir support.

03:14.465 --> 03:16.766
Everything's taken!
All that's left is...

03:16.801 --> 03:18.535
Teen abstinence
counseling.

03:18.569 --> 03:20.303
You get to pass out
abstinence pledges

03:20.337 --> 03:22.939
and make sure the kids
sign their John Han-bleeps.

03:24.642 --> 03:27.777
But, Ned, saying nay
is <i>your</i> thing.

03:27.812 --> 03:29.012
Not this month.

03:29.046 --> 03:30.914
Edna signed us up
for a tango class.

03:30.948 --> 03:34.050
It was the only way I could
avert...  wine-tasting.

03:34.085 --> 03:38.388
Look, I'm really not comfortable
talking about S-E-X

03:38.422 --> 03:40.390
with K-I-D-S.

03:40.424 --> 03:42.225
Language.

03:42.259 --> 03:43.927
Oh, it's not that hard.
Just tell them

03:43.961 --> 03:46.062
that God wants them to ignore
everything in their bodies

03:46.097 --> 03:47.330
that God is making happen.

03:47.364 --> 03:49.599
<i>We</i> took the pledge!

03:49.633 --> 03:51.734
We won't have sex
until we're married!

03:51.769 --> 03:53.570
To each other!

03:55.206 --> 03:58.475
Mm, their skipping lessons
are <i>really</i> paying off.

03:58.509 --> 03:59.976
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

04:01.445 --> 04:04.280
I'm-I'm Marge Simpson,
and I'm here to talk

04:04.315 --> 04:07.817
about a... a-a wonderful,
beautiful thing.

04:07.852 --> 04:09.752
Speaking of beautiful things,

04:09.787 --> 04:11.187
tongue me, babe.

04:19.797 --> 04:22.265
How many of you are here
for the free cookies?

04:22.299 --> 04:23.867
Because we've discontinued that.

04:23.901 --> 04:25.668
I'm out of here.
Forget you!

04:25.703 --> 04:27.670
One of our brightest
and most meddlesome students

04:27.705 --> 04:29.405
called this meeting-- somehow--

04:29.440 --> 04:31.875
to discuss an urgent
menu matter. Lisa?

04:31.909 --> 04:35.111
Our school cafeteria
is serving GMOs--

04:35.146 --> 04:36.946
genetically
modified organisms.

04:38.149 --> 04:40.083
Now, in order
to thoroughly explore the issue,

04:40.117 --> 04:43.520
I'd like to play the first video
that came up in my Web browser

04:43.554 --> 04:45.788
when I typed in
"GMO" plus "danger"

04:45.823 --> 04:47.223
plus "question mark."

04:47.258 --> 04:49.292
Hear, hear!

04:51.896 --> 04:54.497
<i>If there's one thing</i>
<i>scientists love, it's money.</i>

04:54.532 --> 04:56.132
<i>Money, money, money.</i>

04:56.167 --> 04:57.867
<i>And that's been true</i>
<i>of scientists</i>

04:57.902 --> 05:00.170
<i>ever since caveman times.</i>

05:00.204 --> 05:02.639
<i>We need look no further back</i>
<i>than the ancient Mayans,</i>

05:02.673 --> 05:04.541
<i>who crossbred</i>
<i>plants and animals</i>

05:04.575 --> 05:07.644
<i>in an unholy experiment</i>
<i>in what is now a resort</i>

05:07.678 --> 05:10.480
<i>that charges $30 a night</i>
<i>to valet park.</i>

05:10.514 --> 05:12.982
<i>Once you're there,</i>
<i>they've gotcha.</i>

05:14.351 --> 05:15.885
<i>The Mayans didn't listen...</i>

05:15.920 --> 05:17.820
<i>to themselves.</i>

05:17.855 --> 05:20.323
<i>Yet today, we toy with our fate</i>

05:20.357 --> 05:22.158
<i>by using retroviruses</i>

05:22.193 --> 05:25.195
<i>to create these</i>
<i>so-called "super foods."</i>

05:25.229 --> 05:27.197
<i>Are we doomed</i>
<i>to repeat an event</i>

05:27.231 --> 05:29.732
<i>that destroyed all human life?</i>

05:29.767 --> 05:32.302
<i>The answer is in your mouth!</i>

05:36.407 --> 05:40.109
Um, that video seemed
a little unscientific.

05:40.144 --> 05:43.913
My name is Jenny McCarthy,
and I endorse this tirade.

05:43.948 --> 05:46.082
Oh, my God,
it's worse than I thought.

05:46.116 --> 05:49.118
Everybody wait here
while I do some actual research.

05:49.153 --> 05:51.387
Nobody form any opinions
while I'm gone.

05:51.422 --> 05:53.723
Well, hurry,
we have no minds of our own.

05:55.893 --> 05:58.828
I say we do not
categorically ban

05:58.862 --> 06:01.197
genetically modified organisms.

06:01.232 --> 06:02.298
What?!

06:02.333 --> 06:04.367
Well, GMOs are
resistant to pests,

06:04.401 --> 06:05.768
disease and drought.

06:05.803 --> 06:07.570
It's just possible that GMOs

06:07.605 --> 06:10.139
can actually end world hunger.

06:10.174 --> 06:13.876
I say, let's get these GMOs
inside our children pronto!

06:13.911 --> 06:15.111
Way ahead of you!

06:20.918 --> 06:22.552
I'm eating
the food of the future.

06:22.586 --> 06:25.555
Beep, boop. What is love?

06:25.589 --> 06:27.223
Boop, beep, boop.

06:27.258 --> 06:28.891
Lisa, I'd like
to thank you

06:28.926 --> 06:30.460
for mollifying
these land apes.

06:30.494 --> 06:32.929
We'd like you and your
family to visit us

06:32.963 --> 06:34.731
at the Monsarno
research campus.

06:34.765 --> 06:37.467
Ooh, campus! Do you have
a statue of the founder

06:37.501 --> 06:39.435
I can stick
a funny hat on?

06:41.338 --> 06:42.972
Go, go, go!

06:46.010 --> 06:47.076
<i>Simpsons, we're trying</i>

06:47.111 --> 06:50.446
to change the world
one molecule at a time.

06:50.481 --> 06:52.448
Sounds like that
would take a while.

06:52.483 --> 06:53.816
Ooh, you're right.

06:53.851 --> 06:56.352
Everyone, <i>three</i>
molecules at a time.

06:56.387 --> 06:58.821
Oh, you got to
be kidding me!

06:58.856 --> 07:00.657
I'll be home late, honey.

07:00.691 --> 07:02.992
Yeah. <i>Three</i> molecules now.

07:03.027 --> 07:04.527
Well, it's nice
to see for once

07:04.561 --> 07:07.563
a corporation that does good
work and cares about people.

07:07.598 --> 07:10.600
Yes, Lisa, we finally put to bed
the silly notion

07:10.634 --> 07:12.902
that our company
is in any way evil.

07:12.936 --> 07:15.838
Now, say hello to
our chief scientist.

07:17.875 --> 07:19.676
Sideshow Bob!

07:19.710 --> 07:21.277
<i>Dr.</i> Sideshow Bob.

07:21.312 --> 07:23.012
Real doctor or PhD?

07:23.047 --> 07:23.980
PhD.

07:26.746 --> 07:29.001
All right,
I'll leave you and Bob

07:29.002 --> 07:30.836
in this locked room
to get reacquainted.

07:32.372 --> 07:33.438
Simpsons,

07:33.473 --> 07:35.707
there's no need for alarm.

07:38.611 --> 07:40.913
That's not for
you to suck!

07:40.947 --> 07:42.681
Now... where was I?

07:42.715 --> 07:44.683
Right. Uh, no need to worry.

07:44.717 --> 07:46.685
I'm still technically
shawshanking it

07:46.719 --> 07:48.654
at Springfield Penitentiary.

07:48.688 --> 07:49.988
This is getting boring.

07:50.023 --> 07:52.457
Either murder us
or tell us how you got here.

07:52.492 --> 07:53.825
Very well.

07:55.295 --> 07:58.797
<i>The inanity of</i>
<i>the vanity license plate puns</i>

07:58.831 --> 08:01.166
<i>was slowly driving me mad.</i>

08:01.200 --> 08:03.235
<i>So when Monsarno Labs asked</i>
<i>for experimental subjects,</i>

08:03.269 --> 08:05.571
<i>I... gladly volunteered.</i>

08:15.615 --> 08:17.049
<i>My job was to make sure</i>
<i>the experiments</i>

08:17.083 --> 08:19.518
<i>wouldn't be too painful</i>
<i>for the test monkeys.</i>

08:26.225 --> 08:27.626
I don't know what
we're doing here.

08:27.660 --> 08:29.494
Uh, we'll pick it up
after lunch.

08:38.337 --> 08:41.273
<i>I wrote up my results</i>
<i>and went from subject...</i>

08:41.307 --> 08:43.041
<i>to scientist.</i>

08:44.377 --> 08:46.345
Look at me!

08:46.379 --> 08:48.280
I'm Sideshow Bob!

08:48.314 --> 08:49.948
Sideshow Bob!

08:49.983 --> 08:51.850
Foolish boy!
That's phosphoric acid!

08:53.086 --> 08:54.319
A mere sip would
have dissolved

08:54.354 --> 08:56.655
a hole in your stomach the
size of a silver dollar.

08:56.689 --> 08:58.090
Yakety, yakety, yak.

08:58.124 --> 08:59.958
"The spotted hawk
accuses me,

08:59.993 --> 09:01.827
he complains of my gab."

09:01.861 --> 09:05.631
"I too am not a bit tamed,
I too am untranslatable."

09:05.665 --> 09:08.233
Walt Whitman.
<i>Leaves of Grass.</i>

09:08.267 --> 09:10.669
Very good.
Lisa, you always were

09:10.703 --> 09:14.239
the one rose petal
floating atop the cesspool

09:14.273 --> 09:15.907
that is the Simpsons.

09:15.942 --> 09:17.709
- Well!
- That's mean.

09:17.744 --> 09:19.544
Oh...

09:19.579 --> 09:23.081
If you're done, our chief scientist
has to get back to work.

09:23.116 --> 09:25.884
Our corn on the cob
has become self-aware.

09:25.918 --> 09:27.953
Wait! Wait!
Won't you visit me again?

09:27.987 --> 09:31.123
Let me show you I really am
trying to make a better world.

09:31.157 --> 09:33.125
Lisa, we can talk Walt Whitman.

09:33.159 --> 09:35.127
And, Homer, I think
you'd enjoy the company

09:35.161 --> 09:37.629
of the campus' lazy,
overfed squirrels.

09:37.664 --> 09:40.399
"Overfed"? I don't
know this word.

09:49.575 --> 09:51.710
Visit me, Lisa.
We can discuss poetry,

09:51.744 --> 09:55.547
fine art, and...
and if we must, <i>jazz.</i>

09:55.581 --> 09:58.016
Mom, can I visit
Sideshow Bob?

09:58.051 --> 09:59.951
Why would you
want to do that?

09:59.986 --> 10:01.586
He's tried to kill us!

10:01.621 --> 10:03.755
You. He tried
to kill <i>you.</i>

10:03.790 --> 10:05.891
And I refuse to concede
a mind that thinks

10:05.925 --> 10:08.060
so much like mine
can be all bad.

10:08.094 --> 10:11.630
Don't you think the parts that
aren't evil are a little, mm...

10:11.664 --> 10:12.931
pretentious?

10:12.965 --> 10:15.333
Absolutely.
We're talking about Lisa, right?

10:15.368 --> 10:17.369
Shut up!
<i>You</i> shut up!

10:17.403 --> 10:20.338
<i>This</i> is the pinnacle
of conversation around here!

10:20.373 --> 10:21.640
Fine, I'll
take you.

10:21.674 --> 10:23.208
They have this
cool psych class

10:23.242 --> 10:25.310
at the campus
I sat in on.

10:25.344 --> 10:28.313
Uh, that was
a sexual harassment seminar.

10:28.347 --> 10:30.449
It doesn't matter--
I'm taking it pass-fail.

10:33.953 --> 10:36.588
Blowing off steam
in the crafts room, Marge?

10:36.622 --> 10:39.658
No! I'm not giving up
on reaching those kids,

10:39.692 --> 10:41.893
and I might just have
a secret weapon.

10:41.928 --> 10:43.662
Mm-hmm. Is it finger puppets?

10:43.696 --> 10:45.497
Maybe!

10:45.531 --> 10:47.933
Well, we haven't had
finger puppets in this church

10:47.967 --> 10:50.435
since Reverend Brogan
was arrested.

10:50.470 --> 10:53.605
But I suppose
enough time has passed.

10:53.639 --> 10:55.640
And that's why Nancy No

10:55.675 --> 10:58.844
is the most popular girl
in Promiseville High.

10:58.878 --> 11:02.447
Mm. I prefer the modern thinking
of Yolanda Yes.

11:02.482 --> 11:05.817
And I think I'd have a
shot with Mabel Maybe.

11:08.020 --> 11:11.623
I'm so tired
of those kids sniggering.

11:11.657 --> 11:14.459
Uh-oh. It's Horndog Hank.

11:14.494 --> 11:16.895
Well, Nancy knows
how to keep him away.

11:18.865 --> 11:20.799
Darn it, they're stuck.

11:27.039 --> 11:31.943
Um, can I take one
of those girl puppets home?

11:31.978 --> 11:33.678
I won't do nothin' to it.

11:33.713 --> 11:35.013
Oh!

11:36.415 --> 11:37.949
♪ You say modified tomato

11:37.984 --> 11:39.851
♪ I say modified tomahto

11:39.886 --> 11:43.155
♪ I say engineered potato,
you say engineered potahto ♪

11:43.189 --> 11:45.023
♪ Potato!
♪ Potahto!

11:45.057 --> 11:47.159
♪ Tomato!
♪ Tomahto!

11:47.193 --> 11:49.194
♪ Let's splice some DNA!

11:56.569 --> 11:59.504
That is my first
non-evil laugh in years.

11:59.539 --> 12:00.705
Bob,

12:00.740 --> 12:02.607
there's one thing I got to know.

12:02.642 --> 12:04.810
Are you plotting revenge?

12:04.844 --> 12:07.679
I don't plot revenge anymore.

12:07.713 --> 12:09.948
It's like love.
If it happens, it happens.

12:09.982 --> 12:11.983
Now, how about those s'mores?

12:15.087 --> 12:18.390
Dad! You already ate
all the chocolate bars.

12:18.424 --> 12:21.459
That's why I got to get
the marshmallows down fast.

12:22.662 --> 12:24.329
I like how they cut them down

12:24.363 --> 12:26.064
from 140 characters

12:26.098 --> 12:28.700
to a more manageable
20 characters.

12:28.734 --> 12:31.136
Oh, another
seminar tomorrow.

12:31.170 --> 12:34.072
I just wish I could connect
with those teenagers,

12:34.106 --> 12:36.641
since it seems like
we'll never have any.

12:36.676 --> 12:38.276
Oh, Marge,

12:38.311 --> 12:40.579
teens can't control their urges.

12:40.613 --> 12:43.815
It's why there's never been
a teenage president.

12:43.850 --> 12:46.218
Are you saying
I'm wasting my time?

12:46.252 --> 12:49.187
No. I'm saying
you're wasting <i>everyone's</i> time.

12:49.222 --> 12:51.590
But it's a church thing,
so that's a given.

12:51.624 --> 12:53.091
Oh. Well, then maybe

12:53.125 --> 12:55.360
I need to give those
kids a better example.

12:55.394 --> 12:56.728
Good night!

12:56.762 --> 12:59.731
Shut your eyes.
They're too bright.

12:59.765 --> 13:01.233
Sorry.

13:02.602 --> 13:05.770
Kids, today,
we have a very special guest--

13:05.805 --> 13:08.406
my husband.

13:08.441 --> 13:09.574
I brought Homer here

13:09.609 --> 13:11.276
to show that we can,

13:11.310 --> 13:14.913
and have, abstained
for two whole days.

13:14.947 --> 13:17.449
Two days? That's all?

13:17.483 --> 13:20.318
That means, three days
ago, the two of you

13:20.353 --> 13:22.587
made the blob
with two backs!

13:22.622 --> 13:24.055
Listen, you punks,

13:24.090 --> 13:26.758
if you can't handle the image
of our naked bodies

13:26.792 --> 13:29.361
in the tender act of a-oo-ga,

13:29.395 --> 13:33.131
you should never have come to
the basement of this holy place.

13:33.165 --> 13:35.400
Ugh! He's
touching her!

13:35.434 --> 13:37.602
They're practically
doin' it here!

13:37.637 --> 13:38.203
Ugh!

13:43.242 --> 13:44.709
I'll sign the pledge!

13:44.744 --> 13:47.312
Just get your fat heaving
buttocks out of my head!

13:47.346 --> 13:48.613
Never!

13:51.317 --> 13:54.986
All right, Bob,
you've created 5,000 patents,

13:55.021 --> 13:57.188
so... one hour
of freedom.

13:57.223 --> 13:59.658
But remember,
your every move will be watched

13:59.692 --> 14:01.993
by these unarmed docents.

14:02.028 --> 14:04.896
That block's gonna
need its own ticket.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.731
I have a family membership.

14:06.766 --> 14:09.567
Well, if that's
your kid, kiss it.

14:10.903 --> 14:12.103
Mmm.

14:14.340 --> 14:16.074
What next?

14:16.108 --> 14:17.475
Proto-Cubists?

14:17.510 --> 14:19.311
The Pointillists?

14:19.345 --> 14:22.147
Or the alleged art of
Itchy and Scratchy?

14:22.181 --> 14:24.749
Ooh, ooh,
I like the Impressionists.

14:24.784 --> 14:27.252
The boy bands of the art world.

14:27.286 --> 14:31.756
But for you, Lisa, I shall face
the Renoir with sangfroid.

14:31.791 --> 14:33.491
Warmer. Calder.

14:33.526 --> 14:35.427
Warmer. Warmer. Calder.

14:35.461 --> 14:36.594
Calder. Calder!

14:36.629 --> 14:39.597
That's using
your $300,000 M.F.A.

14:47.340 --> 14:48.540
To the Calder mobile!

14:48.574 --> 14:49.975
Ugh!

14:50.009 --> 14:52.877
Bob, you saved me!

14:52.912 --> 14:54.646
But how did you
get the strength?

14:54.680 --> 14:57.082
Calder's work in this period
was marked by heavy use

14:57.116 --> 14:59.651
of sheet metal painted
to look deceptively airy.

14:59.685 --> 15:00.485
Well put.

15:00.519 --> 15:01.886
Thank you.

15:01.921 --> 15:03.154
Answer the question.

15:03.189 --> 15:05.957
Well... there is something
I should have told you.

15:05.992 --> 15:07.625
You see, it occurred to me

15:07.660 --> 15:10.395
that if I can genetically modify
fruits and vegetables,

15:10.429 --> 15:13.031
why can't I modify... me?!

15:13.065 --> 15:15.800
You've been changing your DNA?!

15:15.835 --> 15:19.671
Well, at first,
just a peptide here and there.

15:19.705 --> 15:23.141
Carrot for my presbyopia,
Brahma bull for strength,

15:23.175 --> 15:26.044
and a touch of corn
for highlights on my hair.

15:26.078 --> 15:28.480
So... how strong are you?

15:34.220 --> 15:35.954
Figurines.

15:35.988 --> 15:38.523
Get your porcelain figurines.

15:39.558 --> 15:41.860
Now, how about
those Impressionists?

15:45.903 --> 15:48.856
I... but we sang
Gershwin together!

15:48.990 --> 15:51.625
Well, rhapsody in boo-hoo.

15:51.659 --> 15:54.227
Do you know why we came
to the museum today?

15:54.262 --> 15:57.898
Well, I thought it was
because it was Tote Bag Day.

15:57.932 --> 16:02.636
Well, that was part of it,
but the biggest part was <i>that!</i>

16:02.670 --> 16:05.572
Washington's backbone,
Einstein's eyebrows.

16:05.606 --> 16:07.107
Florence Nightingale's tenacity,

16:07.141 --> 16:09.242
though I'll have
to clip around her moral fiber.

16:09.277 --> 16:11.378
You're going to take DNA

16:11.412 --> 16:14.581
from these historical figures
and add it to your own!

16:14.615 --> 16:16.950
I shall be the wisest
and strongest maniac

16:16.984 --> 16:20.654
ever to bring the blessings
of dictatorship to the world!

16:22.023 --> 16:23.990
Jig's up, Bob!

16:24.025 --> 16:26.593
Return the spear
to the <i>Homo erectus.</i>

16:26.627 --> 16:28.495
<i>Homo erectus?</i>

16:28.529 --> 16:31.197
Where has that word been
all my life?

16:31.232 --> 16:33.433
Now, Bart, I promised
I wouldn't hurt you.

16:33.467 --> 16:34.834
You did that for me?

16:34.869 --> 16:36.836
More for Mom, but yes.

16:36.871 --> 16:38.972
But beware, I have DNA in me

16:39.006 --> 16:40.774
from <i>Ophiocordyceps</i>
<i>unilateralis,</i>

16:40.808 --> 16:42.142
better known as...

16:42.176 --> 16:45.845
zombie ant fungus!

16:45.880 --> 16:50.283
And we're scared
of that because...?

16:50.318 --> 16:52.519
What I am saying is,
I could be tipped

16:52.553 --> 16:54.553
into a murderous rage
by the slightest provocation.

16:54.555 --> 16:57.023
Could you take a picture of me
with my family?

16:57.058 --> 16:58.558
Mm-hmm.

16:58.593 --> 17:01.795
Oh, would you take another
for safety?

17:01.829 --> 17:03.964
Oh, I think my eyes
were shut in that one.

17:05.733 --> 17:07.867
Now, can you take one
with my husband's camera?

17:07.902 --> 17:09.669
They're all ugly
because you're in them!

17:09.704 --> 17:11.304
Oh.

17:12.173 --> 17:15.976
Taste Praxiteles of Athens!

17:25.685 --> 17:28.188
Uh, Chief, we got a report
of a disturbance at the Met.

17:28.222 --> 17:29.689
We got bigger problems, Lou.

17:29.724 --> 17:32.325
Horny teens who should be
out having bad sex,

17:32.360 --> 17:36.196
but instead somebody made them
take an abstinence pledge,

17:36.230 --> 17:37.497
by the looks of it.

17:39.433 --> 17:41.034
I don't get it.
There are taboos

17:41.068 --> 17:42.669
about premarital sex
in the Middle East,

17:42.703 --> 17:45.405
and you don't see those people
getting all violent.

17:49.110 --> 17:50.810
You can't escape me!

17:50.845 --> 17:56.349
I've got grasshopper thighs
and the sonar of a killer whale!

18:10.097 --> 18:16.302
Uh, Bob, you can't kill us
without a little singing, right?

18:16.337 --> 18:17.637
A little singing?

18:17.672 --> 18:19.139
If there's one thing
he did not have

18:19.173 --> 18:21.408
to genetically enhance,
it's his voice.

18:21.442 --> 18:26.146
♪ Non piu andrai,
farfallone amoroso... ♪

18:27.682 --> 18:31.418
How dare you torture my children
with Mozart!

18:31.452 --> 18:33.420
Ah, you know Mozart?

18:33.454 --> 18:35.655
I call all music Mozart!

18:35.690 --> 18:38.792
We're here to stop you
with the help of

18:38.826 --> 18:40.427
the teenage
abstinence class!

18:40.461 --> 18:41.961
If you defeat this madman,

18:41.996 --> 18:43.763
I'll release you
from your pledge

18:43.798 --> 18:46.766
and teach you other fun ways
not to get pregnant.

18:46.801 --> 18:48.935
I think
I might be pregnant already.

18:48.969 --> 18:50.470
Well, that's one of 'em.

18:57.545 --> 19:00.113
Python jaw... unhinge!

19:00.147 --> 19:01.548
Aah!

19:01.582 --> 19:03.883
I don't want to die in
some old dude's mouth!

19:06.454 --> 19:08.354
Bob, would you look
at yourself?!

19:09.824 --> 19:12.192
To quote Whitman,
"This is what you shall do:

19:12.226 --> 19:14.227
"love the earth
and sun and animals,

19:14.261 --> 19:17.530
despise riches, stand up
for the stupid and crazy..."

19:20.000 --> 19:21.334
Who am I kidding?

19:21.368 --> 19:23.470
My only exit...
is a final one.

19:23.504 --> 19:24.871
What?! No!

19:24.905 --> 19:26.372
Farewell, Simpsons.

19:26.407 --> 19:28.608
And, Lisa, when
you're older,

19:28.642 --> 19:31.811
write an autobiographical novel
trashing the rest of them.

19:31.846 --> 19:33.146
How veiled?

19:33.180 --> 19:35.715
Thinly!

19:45.192 --> 19:46.392
Now, don't worry.

19:46.427 --> 19:50.330
Your friend will always be
part of our drinking water.

19:58.038 --> 20:01.374
Oh, right, I gave myself gills.

20:15.232 --> 20:18.368
I told you, the only
dancing I like is square.

20:18.402 --> 20:21.838
Hey, I let you pay for
those boys' skipping lessons.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.306
Okay.

20:33.684 --> 20:37.020
Ooh! Ned! Ha!

20:39.790 --> 20:42.025
Sure do miss that laugh.

20:42.059 --> 20:45.061
Ha, ha!
I miss her, too.
