01:39.766 --> 01:43.202
How much blood will you shed
to stay alive, Michael?

01:43.236 --> 01:46.262
Live or die,
make your choice.

01:46.306 --> 01:49.707
Who the fuck
are you?

01:59.252 --> 02:01.277
What the fuck
you doing in there?

02:01.321 --> 02:03.448
We're gonna
miss the previews.

02:06.326 --> 02:07.918
What?

02:07.961 --> 02:10.953
Tell me your earring went
in the fucking drain again.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.923
l'm pregnant.

02:16.903 --> 02:19.736
l know it's my fault. l know l shouldn't
have let you take off the rubber.

02:19.772 --> 02:22.673
l thought we were okay. l was due for my
period. My cycle's like clockwork.

02:22.709 --> 02:24.836
Stop.

02:26.846 --> 02:29.940
- l'll call the clinic tomorrow.
- Stop talking.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.493
Let's get married.

02:47.534 --> 02:50.503
What?

02:51.771 --> 02:54.296
We'll drive to A.C.,
make a day out of it.

02:54.340 --> 02:57.173
Are you serious?

03:01.648 --> 03:03.843
Christopher.
l love you.

03:11.491 --> 03:14.654
- My baby.
- Yeah.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.424
My ex, she couldn't have kids,
and l wanted 'em so bad.

03:18.698 --> 03:20.689
The one who
ran out on you?

03:23.970 --> 03:26.370
You can bet she's having some other
asshole's kid, though.

03:26.406 --> 03:29.239
That fucking tramp.

03:44.424 --> 03:48.554
Elzear, patron saint
of zeppoles.

03:48.595 --> 03:51.530
Could use a shot
of lacquer.

03:51.564 --> 03:54.897
- Fix that halo, too.
- Shh!

03:54.934 --> 03:56.959
Hello.

03:57.003 --> 03:59.198
Mr. Gaultieri,
l'm Father Jose.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.072
l'm Mr. Gaultieri.
Where's Father Felix?

04:02.108 --> 04:03.939
Unfortunately he's ill.

04:03.977 --> 04:06.445
He's having bypass surgery.
He asked me to fill in.

04:06.479 --> 04:09.209
You know Mr. Russamano
from the Neighborhood Association.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.308
Sure, Paulie, Chuck,
how you feeling?

04:11.351 --> 04:14.445
He was an altar boy.

04:14.487 --> 04:17.115
Ahh.

04:17.156 --> 04:20.454
So the Feast
of St. Elzear.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.461
Father Felix brought me
up to speed.

04:22.495 --> 04:24.622
l'd like to hear your
ideas for this year.

04:24.664 --> 04:26.564
Well, there ain't much
to talk about.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.090
lt's all done through
our nonprofit corporation.

04:29.135 --> 04:31.660
We close the streets
for five days,

04:31.704 --> 04:34.104
hire the food vendors,
rides, et cetera.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.108
Day two, we start
the procession,

04:36.142 --> 04:38.235
push the statue up
and down the block.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.075
You say a couple
of prayers and that's that.

04:40.113 --> 04:42.411
All's said and done,
you get your end.

04:42.448 --> 04:46.145
About that, as l was
telling Mr. Russamano,

04:46.185 --> 04:50.417
frankly $10,000
struck me as quite low.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.447
lt is what it is.

04:52.492 --> 04:55.461
Look, l'm new here.
l certainly don't wanna rock the boat.

04:55.495 --> 04:58.225
l realize there are
certain neighborhood traditions.

04:58.264 --> 05:00.698
lt's just that given the current costs,
we feel an increase

05:00.733 --> 05:03.566
- is long overdue.
- What kind of increase?

05:03.603 --> 05:06.595
We feel $50,000 would be
a more equitable donation.

05:06.639 --> 05:08.630
- 50?
- Just this year,

05:08.675 --> 05:10.506
we started a soup kitchen
for the homeless,

05:10.543 --> 05:12.204
a reading program
for bilingual children.

05:12.245 --> 05:14.406
There's less help than ever
from the federal government.

05:14.447 --> 05:16.415
You think this feast
pays for itself?

05:16.449 --> 05:19.009
Security, electric,
sanitation.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.849
- Not to mention fuel costs.
- Yeah.

05:20.887 --> 05:23.913
The way it seems
to break down is you spend $18

05:23.956 --> 05:26.186
for a city permit
to close down the street,

05:26.225 --> 05:28.318
charge fees
to the vendors

05:28.361 --> 05:30.659
in the thousands
of dollars to lease out land

05:30.697 --> 05:32.358
that you don't
even own.

05:32.398 --> 05:35.697
Yeah? Well, it seems to me the church
has plenty in its coffers

05:35.735 --> 05:39.034
for all those
pedophilia lawsuits.

05:39.072 --> 05:42.303
The parish's deal was negotiated since
this was Johnny Soprano's feast.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.175
These are different times,
Mr. Gaultieri.

05:45.211 --> 05:46.906
Well, some things
don't change.

05:46.946 --> 05:50.006
Couple of days, Joe Vella from the Honor
Guard will be by with the float.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.847
Transfer the statue
from his niche,

05:52.885 --> 05:55.012
pick up the hat
and other stuff.

05:55.054 --> 05:57.215
You say things
don't change.

05:57.256 --> 05:59.224
This feast was started
over 100 years ago

05:59.258 --> 06:01.158
in a spirit of giving.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.253
ltalian immigrants,
the working poor

06:03.296 --> 06:06.356
gave what little money
they had to honor St. Elzear.

06:06.399 --> 06:09.061
He's the patron saint
from my grandparent's town--

06:09.102 --> 06:10.763
Ariano di Puglia.

06:10.803 --> 06:13.067
Many of those folks gave their gold
wedding bands, which were melted

06:13.106 --> 06:15.165
- down to make the saint's hat.
- Yeah?

06:15.208 --> 06:19.406
The Holy Society
of St. Elzear,

06:19.445 --> 06:23.006
of which you are
recording secretary,

06:23.049 --> 06:25.745
has for the past
100 years entrusted us

06:25.785 --> 06:28.379
with the care
of that habiliment.

06:30.823 --> 06:32.814
Frankly...

06:32.859 --> 06:35.225
l don't feel safe
giving it over this year.

06:35.261 --> 06:37.729
We use it every year.
lt's part of the tradition.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.732
l understand,
but l'm sorry.

06:39.766 --> 06:42.735
Given the tenor of this conversation,
l sense there's a possible

06:42.769 --> 06:44.361
criminal element
in this neighborhood

06:44.404 --> 06:48.101
that could endanger
this precious piece of local history.

06:48.141 --> 06:52.237
But for 50 grand,
you wouldn't have that sense.

06:52.278 --> 06:55.372
lt would demonstrate to me that you
take this feast as seriously

06:55.415 --> 06:56.939
as the people
who began it.

06:59.285 --> 07:01.810
Okay, Father,
nice meeting you.

07:15.501 --> 07:18.265
Fuck the hat!

07:20.640 --> 07:22.608
lt's fucking bullshit.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.803
l got a fax from Eddie Lind,
Allegheny Carting.

07:24.844 --> 07:28.439
They wanna raise
the tipping fee again on solid waste.

07:28.481 --> 07:31.314
Just the man
l wanted to see.

07:31.350 --> 07:34.979
l gotta go down to Pennsylvania
and l'm gonna need backup.

07:35.021 --> 07:37.581
l'm busy managing
the feast.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.683
Vice president
in charge of calzones.

07:40.726 --> 07:42.853
Where the fuck
you been anyway?

07:44.797 --> 07:47.459
ls that what
l think it is?

07:47.500 --> 07:50.731
You are now looking
at a newly married man.

07:50.770 --> 07:53.500
- Ho-ho-holy shit!
- Kelli?

07:55.908 --> 07:58.240
What the fuck
brought this on?

07:58.277 --> 08:00.905
Visit from the stork
coming up.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.750
You never heard
of pulling out?

08:04.784 --> 08:07.184
Sweetheart, little
Cristal over here.

08:07.220 --> 08:09.586
- You know what you're having?
- Boy, l hope.

08:09.622 --> 08:12.785
l tell ya, T,
with the example you set,

08:12.825 --> 08:15.385
plus the wisdom
l learned from AA,

08:15.428 --> 08:17.623
it's an inspiration--
building blocks,

08:17.663 --> 08:19.961
home, family.

08:19.999 --> 08:23.162
Yeah, that's what
it's all about, kid.

08:23.202 --> 08:25.170
Just water for me.

08:25.204 --> 08:27.570
My son will
be my strength.

08:31.110 --> 08:32.975
Yeah.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.808
l did?

08:34.847 --> 08:36.837
What are you,
new in the office?

08:36.883 --> 08:39.215
Talk to Dr. Cipolla.

08:39.251 --> 08:41.447
l don't pay
for missed appointments.

08:41.486 --> 08:45.218
- To the baby.
- To the baby.

08:45.258 --> 08:47.249
- Salut.
- Salut.

08:49.695 --> 08:51.390
Make a note to call
Freddie at DiSorbo's.

08:51.430 --> 08:53.421
He wants to sponsor
the cannoli-eating contest,

08:53.466 --> 08:55.934
l better see an envelope
by tomorrow.

08:58.271 --> 09:02.207
Anyway, my guy
at the weigh station's on board.

09:02.241 --> 09:04.573
- You know how to get back, right?
- l MapBlasted it.

09:04.610 --> 09:06.703
All right, see you guys.

09:13.920 --> 09:16.081
Look, Pittsburgh.

09:16.122 --> 09:18.522
What the fuck?
We're supposed to be headed east.

09:20.626 --> 09:24.392
Are we .7 miles
past Route 62 yet?

09:26.265 --> 09:28.529
l gotta take a piss.

09:58.230 --> 10:00.926
You seeing this?

10:00.967 --> 10:03.128
Looks like bikers.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.439
Wooden crates.

10:09.475 --> 10:12.467
lt's good wine.

10:42.208 --> 10:45.336
- What the fuck?
- Who the fuck are you guys?

10:45.378 --> 10:48.108
- That's who l am, you mangy cocksucker.
- Take it easy.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.776
On the ground or l'll blow your greasy
fucking heads off.

10:51.817 --> 10:54.149
- You guys cops?
- How's your incision, Lieutenant?

10:54.186 --> 10:55.744
10-4.

10:55.788 --> 10:57.346
You're fucking with
the Vipers here, asshole.

10:57.390 --> 10:59.483
Ooh, really?

10:59.525 --> 11:02.119
What's that,
your Girl Scout troop?

11:02.161 --> 11:04.095
Shut up,
fucking douchebag.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.291
Let's go.

11:09.735 --> 11:11.999
- Get him!
- Ow!

11:20.413 --> 11:23.177
l hit him!
l fucking hit him!

11:23.215 --> 11:25.809
Fuck you!

11:28.187 --> 11:30.178
Yee-ha!

11:35.428 --> 11:39.364
That was fucking awesome.
Fucking old-school shit.

11:39.398 --> 11:41.161
Opportunity knocked.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.998
Knocked? Kicked
the fucking door in.

11:46.439 --> 11:48.407
Oh, fuck!

11:48.441 --> 11:50.238
You okay, T?

11:50.276 --> 11:52.767
Fucking ankle,
l guess l sprained it.

11:58.017 --> 12:01.350
You smell that?
lt's fucking autumn.

12:01.387 --> 12:04.254
lt's like the first fall night when
you're a kid, and the air's all crisp,

12:04.290 --> 12:06.622
and you start smelling
people's fireplaces.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.650
Smells like Halloween.

12:10.696 --> 12:12.687
Ha ha!

12:20.206 --> 12:22.470
Oh...

12:22.508 --> 12:25.568
Chateau Pichon-Longueville,
1986.

12:25.611 --> 12:27.977
'86-- ooh, baby.

12:28.013 --> 12:30.174
Show me the money.

12:31.450 --> 12:34.010
What's your corkage fee?

12:36.222 --> 12:39.089
How about that prick's
face when he saw the gat?

12:41.260 --> 12:44.229
The Grizzly Adams
motherfucker?

12:44.263 --> 12:47.630
''Whoa, take it easy.''

12:47.666 --> 12:50.499
''We're with the Vipers.''

13:02.581 --> 13:05.209
How's that wine, good?

13:05.251 --> 13:09.187
lt really is,
l gotta say.

13:12.324 --> 13:14.383
l tell ya, though,

13:14.426 --> 13:16.621
when he pulled
that trigger,

13:16.662 --> 13:18.596
l almost shit myself.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.290
Yeah.

13:30.109 --> 13:32.304
l miss it sometimes.
l'll be honest.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.446
The wine.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.618
You should toast
at your wedding, at least.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.143
Your kid.

13:43.722 --> 13:46.748
Discipline, that's all.

13:46.792 --> 13:49.590
Set limits for myself.

13:56.802 --> 14:00.101
On the other side,
they consider wine food.

14:00.139 --> 14:02.198
Oh, yeah?

14:03.843 --> 14:06.812
- Salut.
- Salut.

14:13.252 --> 14:17.188
l'm gonna have to
sleep on my back.

14:18.490 --> 14:21.050
- What are you doing?
- Nightcap.

14:21.093 --> 14:24.654
There's a Swiss Army
in the console.

14:29.435 --> 14:32.836
When you think of the shit
we've been through, huh?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.931
Shit we've done.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.536
Fucking
Three Musketeers.

14:48.854 --> 14:51.084
We got a bond.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.185
lt's very special.

15:01.100 --> 15:04.331
You saved my life
in a lot of ways.

15:04.370 --> 15:07.339
You've been there for me,
too, you know?

15:08.540 --> 15:10.508
Don't think
l don't know that.

15:10.542 --> 15:13.705
There were times

15:13.746 --> 15:15.714
it was hard
with me and you.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.375
l didn't understand.

15:20.486 --> 15:24.047
You were young.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.114
Stubborn.

15:27.326 --> 15:29.692
You always had
my back, though.

15:33.098 --> 15:35.760
Like that day
when l came to the house.

15:42.041 --> 15:44.100
l gotta talk to you.

16:00.859 --> 16:02.520
What's wrong?

16:03.862 --> 16:06.160
What's the matter?

16:06.198 --> 16:09.463
You know l've always
been loyal to you, T.

16:09.501 --> 16:13.130
What are you trying
to tell me, Christopher?

16:17.543 --> 16:19.534
l can't even say it.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.373
Oh, fuck.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.146
Adriana.

16:28.921 --> 16:30.821
What about her?

16:32.057 --> 16:34.048
The feds.

16:41.300 --> 16:44.531
Jesus-fucking-Christ.

16:44.570 --> 16:47.698
How long?

16:47.740 --> 16:50.504
- How fucking long?
- A year, l don't know.

16:52.544 --> 16:54.444
When did you find out?

16:54.480 --> 16:57.813
She just told me
last night.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.977
What do they know, huh?

17:00.019 --> 17:02.852
- What did she give 'em?
- l don't know.

17:05.523 --> 17:07.388
Might take a lot.

17:07.425 --> 17:10.122
Ralphie?

17:10.162 --> 17:12.425
l don't know.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.833
Oh, Tony, how could
you even think that?

17:22.340 --> 17:24.002
Where is she?

17:25.844 --> 17:29.371
- Where the fuck is she? Where is she?
- Please, Ton'.

17:29.415 --> 17:32.009
Where is she?

17:32.051 --> 17:34.042
She's home.

17:39.158 --> 17:42.821
l can't.
l can't do it, Ton'.

17:42.861 --> 17:45.421
No, please,
don't make me do it.

17:45.464 --> 17:48.900
l can't do it.
l can't do it.

17:48.934 --> 17:51.198
All right.

17:51.236 --> 17:53.329
l can't.

17:53.372 --> 17:55.101
- All right.
- l can't do it.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.301
l'm gonna
take care of it.

17:58.811 --> 18:02.338
All right.

18:02.381 --> 18:04.781
Come on, come on.

18:04.817 --> 18:08.184
Now listen to me.

18:08.220 --> 18:10.381
You go upstairs.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.788
You go out
the back door.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.816
Don't talk to Carmela.

18:16.829 --> 18:20.788
You go someplace,
have a cup of coffee.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.301
You wait
till l call you.

18:23.335 --> 18:25.428
Huh?

18:25.471 --> 18:28.463
lt's okay. We're gonna
take care of it.

18:31.877 --> 18:33.902
Go ahead.

18:48.127 --> 18:50.186
l love you, man.

18:58.036 --> 19:00.027
l love you, too.

19:43.215 --> 19:46.514
- l like it.
- Welcome.

19:46.552 --> 19:49.680
- Joan Gillespie, Pagano Realty.
- Kelli Moltisanti.

19:49.721 --> 19:52.952
We spoke on the phone.
My husband Christopher.

19:52.991 --> 19:55.892
- How do you do?
- This is what l'm talking about.

19:55.928 --> 19:58.123
''Stately Wayne Manor.''

19:58.163 --> 20:02.031
Four bedrooms, marble baths
with Kohler fixtures.

20:02.067 --> 20:04.331
Sub-Zero in the
stainless steel kitchen.

20:04.369 --> 20:06.303
We'll take it.

20:06.338 --> 20:08.465
He's what we call
an impulse buyer.

20:08.507 --> 20:10.668
Shouldn't we see
the inside first, sweetie?

20:10.709 --> 20:13.576
lf it has an inside,
we're buying it.

20:34.199 --> 20:37.532
Where's the rest?
Five days rent in advance, l said.

20:37.569 --> 20:41.335
What if it rains? Ohio State Fair gives
you a rebate for bad weather.

20:41.373 --> 20:43.864
Yet another reason
l don't live in Ohio.

20:46.878 --> 20:49.870
Easy on the sugar, hon'.
They tell me l'm sweet enough.

20:51.049 --> 20:53.108
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

20:55.587 --> 20:58.112
Jesus Christ,
what did he do now?

20:58.156 --> 21:00.124
lt's an old polo injury.

21:03.028 --> 21:07.294
- Huh?
- Let me talk to you a minute.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.538
Couple of guys we know,

21:13.572 --> 21:16.006
Lebanese or some shit,

21:16.041 --> 21:17.633
they diverted a truck,

21:17.676 --> 21:19.940
whole semi-trailer full
of Centrum Multivitamins.

21:19.978 --> 21:21.946
That's a fucking score.

21:21.980 --> 21:23.948
Yeah, the thing is
it's gotta be unloaded out of state,

21:23.982 --> 21:27.645
'cause the troopers are on it.
You interested?

21:27.686 --> 21:31.281
Could be distributed
in Long lsland.

21:31.323 --> 21:33.848
What's my end?

21:33.892 --> 21:37.089
50-50, but it's
gotta be done now, tonight.

21:37.129 --> 21:39.120
Tonight?

21:43.135 --> 21:45.797
All right,
but in this case,

21:45.837 --> 21:49.102
l'm thinking we spare John the stress
of having to hear about this.

21:55.747 --> 21:59.308
The situation he's in,
he's got enough to deal with.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.855
Get me Frankie Cosme
on the cell.

22:21.940 --> 22:24.738
Yeah, somebody wants
to talk to you. Hold on.

22:38.056 --> 22:40.149
Did you pray?

22:40.192 --> 22:42.353
Said a ''thank you''
for Daddy's recovery.

22:43.895 --> 22:47.661
You had arthroscopic surgery,
you can't bend a knee?

22:49.334 --> 22:51.734
Dad said he's gonna
meet us on the corner.

22:53.772 --> 22:56.172
lsn't that Ade's mom?

22:56.208 --> 22:59.837
- Oh my God. She looks terrible.
- Who?

22:59.878 --> 23:02.870
Chris' ex, her mom.

23:02.914 --> 23:05.246
She saw us.
l should say hello.

23:08.887 --> 23:11.117
Liz, hi.

23:11.156 --> 23:13.647
l saw you're on the committee.
That's so great.

23:13.692 --> 23:15.683
Carmela Soprano.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.560
- How's your daughter?
- Fine.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.531
Well, mine is dead.

23:20.565 --> 23:22.192
Oh my God, when?
What happened?

23:22.234 --> 23:25.761
When? That piece
of shit, your nephew.

23:25.804 --> 23:28.773
They broke up, Liz.
She ran off.

23:28.807 --> 23:31.071
She doesn't call me
for almost two years.

23:31.109 --> 23:33.100
My birthday,
Christmas.

23:33.145 --> 23:36.114
You two always did have
a very difficult relationship.

23:36.148 --> 23:38.241
The FBl came
to my home.

23:38.283 --> 23:41.252
You'd be amazed
at the questions they asked me.

23:41.286 --> 23:43.379
- Liz--
- They admitted

23:43.422 --> 23:45.049
they think that he killed her.

23:45.090 --> 23:47.058
Come on, Liz,
you're drunk.

23:47.092 --> 23:50.357
Drunk?
lt's called depression.

23:50.395 --> 23:53.057
l haven't had a drink
in years.

23:58.103 --> 24:00.765
There were times,
l was a kid,

24:00.806 --> 24:03.775
my friend Ronnie, we'd play
on the floor of my kitchen--

24:03.809 --> 24:07.575
linoleum, Matchbox cars
or whatever.

24:07.612 --> 24:10.513
He'd go home, his fucking knees
would be filthy.

24:10.549 --> 24:14.417
His elbows--
she never cleaned, my mother.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.944
Fucking house
was a pigsty.

24:16.988 --> 24:20.924
Ronnie's mother made
him stop coming over it was so dirty.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.757
- That's fucked up.
- Embarrassing.

24:23.795 --> 24:26.320
My kid,
it'll be different.

24:26.364 --> 24:28.832
He'll be proud
of his house.

24:28.867 --> 24:31.199
Wait till you see
this place.

24:33.572 --> 24:35.403
So that thing,
Rusty Milio,

24:35.440 --> 24:38.466
l heard that happened.

24:38.510 --> 24:41.479
Good job.

24:41.513 --> 24:43.504
lt's a little less cash
than we talked about.

24:43.548 --> 24:45.948
But there's a bonus
in there for you.

24:52.290 --> 24:55.418
lt's okay
if l fix?

24:55.460 --> 24:57.587
Just take me
to my car.

24:57.629 --> 25:00.325
Rock out
with your cock out.

25:06.972 --> 25:11.341
Fireplace,
parquet floors,

25:11.376 --> 25:15.312
bumper pool table
in the basement.

25:15.347 --> 25:18.339
- Huh?
- The house l'm getting.

25:18.383 --> 25:20.544
You'll come over.

25:20.585 --> 25:23.713
Christmas,
Christmas Eve, maybe.

25:23.755 --> 25:26.485
l'm gonna start
a tradition.

25:28.927 --> 25:31.760
You know, you really gotta
get yourself some help with this shit.

25:31.796 --> 25:33.627
l will.
l'm gonna.

25:41.506 --> 25:43.474
Those fucking works,
though.

25:43.508 --> 25:46.909
Whets my whistle, that spike.
Why is that?

25:48.547 --> 25:50.538
l don't know.

25:54.219 --> 25:56.380
You want some?

25:56.421 --> 25:58.218
Me? Nah.

26:01.359 --> 26:05.022
Okay, it's just,
you know, if you want.

26:08.366 --> 26:10.391
Guess l could toot some.

26:19.044 --> 26:21.239
l remember...

26:21.279 --> 26:24.043
when l did
a lot of blow,

26:24.082 --> 26:26.050
l used
to get diarrhea

26:26.084 --> 26:28.484
just from the smell
of paper money--

26:28.520 --> 26:33.014
in a store,
any fucking place,

26:33.058 --> 26:35.458
on account of all
the baby laxative in the coke

26:35.493 --> 26:38.087
when you actually
snort it.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.259
l meant what l said,
though,

26:42.300 --> 26:45.633
you need to get
your ass to rehab.

26:45.670 --> 26:48.867
Fucking Narcotics
Anonymous or some shit.

27:03.922 --> 27:05.890
How do you like
this car?

27:05.924 --> 27:10.327
lt's nice,
the leather.

29:58.263 --> 29:59.958
See ya.

30:03.234 --> 30:05.395
Here he comes.

30:05.436 --> 30:07.802
God bless you,
St. Elzear.

30:07.839 --> 30:10.433
Where's his gold hat?

30:20.952 --> 30:23.944
Pray for my mother,
St. Elzear.

30:23.988 --> 30:26.616
Hey, they forgot
his hat.

30:28.860 --> 30:32.694
This is my nephew George,
just back from lraq.

30:32.730 --> 30:36.962
- Two tours he done.
- l'm proud of you, my friend.

30:44.709 --> 30:46.677
What do you need?

30:46.711 --> 30:48.702
l don't know.

30:50.148 --> 30:54.050
There's prosciutto in there,
some leftover sesame noodles.

30:56.354 --> 30:58.822
Tofu would make
your doctor happy.

31:13.571 --> 31:15.562
How's the ankle?

31:15.607 --> 31:17.336
lt's better.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.366
Cold packs helped.

31:20.845 --> 31:24.008
Did you have
the riser fixed?

31:24.048 --> 31:28.109
Yeah, yeah, Brian Spatafore
was over the Pork Store.

31:28.152 --> 31:31.383
Had him tighten up
the banister, everything.

31:31.422 --> 31:33.413
You all right?

31:36.327 --> 31:38.295
l have been debating
all night whether

31:38.329 --> 31:40.524
to even say anything
about this.

31:45.203 --> 31:48.798
l ran into Liz La Cerva
at the feast.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.777
- Yeah...
- She's got it in her head

31:53.811 --> 31:56.245
that Christopher
killed Adriana.

31:59.250 --> 32:02.413
What?
That's insane.

32:02.453 --> 32:05.286
l know.

32:05.323 --> 32:08.554
Then again, he does have
a history of being free with his hands.

32:08.593 --> 32:11.027
That makes him O.J.?

32:11.062 --> 32:13.292
She was probably drunk.

32:13.331 --> 32:15.663
l really don't
think she was.

32:17.502 --> 32:21.131
Let me school you
on domestic violence, okay?

32:21.172 --> 32:24.369
First and foremost,
there's always a body.

32:24.409 --> 32:27.139
And 99 out of 100--

32:27.178 --> 32:29.476
and this comes straight
from my cop buddies--

32:29.514 --> 32:33.450
it happens either
in the bedroom or in the kitchen.

32:35.353 --> 32:36.911
He killed her,

32:36.955 --> 32:39.355
believe me with the forensics
they got nowadays,

32:39.390 --> 32:43.417
the fibers,
we'd know about it.

32:43.461 --> 32:46.897
The FBl came
to her house-- Liz.

32:46.931 --> 32:49.832
That's exactly my point.
lf they really thought he did it,

32:49.867 --> 32:52.700
how fast do you think
they'd haul his ass in?

32:56.207 --> 32:58.334
Sour grapes, Carm.

32:58.376 --> 33:01.470
He dumps her daughter, all of a sudden
he's Scott fucking Peterson.

33:01.512 --> 33:05.915
- l thought Ade dumped him.
- You know what l mean.

33:05.950 --> 33:07.144
She was a sweet girl, Ade,

33:07.185 --> 33:09.619
but the two of them together
was a toxic relationship.

33:09.654 --> 33:12.748
Yeah, they did have
a rough time of it.

33:12.790 --> 33:14.758
And he's doing great--
Christopher.

33:14.792 --> 33:16.760
He's a different person.

33:16.794 --> 33:18.762
He's married.
He's got a kid on the way.

33:18.796 --> 33:20.957
He's focused.

33:20.999 --> 33:24.457
Let's not sabotage
his progress.

33:26.871 --> 33:28.862
Hmm?

33:38.883 --> 33:41.818
Have a dozen extra large
brought over to Satriale's.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.483
- Hello.
- Paul, Dr. Cipolla.

33:46.524 --> 33:49.891
l'm on my way out. l received
the results of your PSA test.

33:49.927 --> 33:52.191
- And?
- Not to worry.

33:52.230 --> 33:54.255
But the numbers
are a little higher than l prefer.

33:54.298 --> 33:57.290
- What does that mean?
- Probably nothing.

33:57.335 --> 34:00.827
Likelihood is prostatitis,
simple inflammation.

34:00.872 --> 34:04.205
You have a history
of prostate cancer in your family?

34:04.242 --> 34:07.302
- Father maybe?
- l don't know.

34:07.345 --> 34:10.109
Well, l'd like to go ahead
and schedule you for a biopsy.

34:13.484 --> 34:15.975
This is lame.
l wanna go on the Octopus.

34:16.020 --> 34:18.215
Can you stop for one minute
breaking my balls?

34:18.255 --> 34:20.520
When your father gets
back from the bathroom with Sophia,

34:20.558 --> 34:22.822
- you can go on whatever.
- lt's a kiddie ride.

34:22.860 --> 34:25.487
Yeah, but she wants
to go on the ride with her big brother.

34:25.530 --> 34:28.966
Here we go!
You ready, baby?

34:29.000 --> 34:30.558
Go for a ride
with Mama?

34:30.601 --> 34:32.501
This is too small.
l'll be all squished.

34:32.536 --> 34:34.869
Yeah, so you go sit
in that one, and wave to her.

34:34.906 --> 34:37.033
Oh, there's my girl.

34:37.074 --> 34:40.237
There's my girl!

34:40.277 --> 34:43.577
Yeah, are you ready to go
on the ride with Mama?

34:44.715 --> 34:47.616
Are you ready?
Get ready.

34:47.652 --> 34:50.085
Yeah,
we're gonna go soon.

34:50.121 --> 34:53.851
Oh, here we go!

34:53.891 --> 34:56.917
All around the floor.

34:56.960 --> 35:00.055
Wipe that puss
off your face.

35:23.654 --> 35:26.782
- My baby!
- Oh my God, call an ambulance!

35:26.824 --> 35:29.054
Excuse me!

35:29.093 --> 35:31.926
lt's okay. lt's okay.

35:31.963 --> 35:33.555
This is
a temperature gun.

35:33.598 --> 35:36.294
217'.

35:36.334 --> 35:38.529
Look at that.

35:41.672 --> 35:44.140
- Yeah.
- Paulie, it's me.

35:44.175 --> 35:46.803
We had a problem down here.
The ride--

35:46.844 --> 35:48.505
the Teacups
or whatever,

35:48.546 --> 35:50.844
a bolt busted.
Thing jammed up.

35:50.882 --> 35:53.442
- Some people got hurt.
- Where's the guy who owns it?

35:53.484 --> 35:55.782
He's talking
to the cops.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.152
Fine, fuck it.
What do you want from me?

35:58.189 --> 36:01.420
lt's pretty bad, Paulie.
Lady broke her wrist.

36:01.459 --> 36:04.087
Some Puerto Rican kid
lost some teeth.

36:04.128 --> 36:06.119
What am l,
a fucking dentist?

36:06.164 --> 36:08.394
l don't know.
l thought you'd want to know.

36:08.432 --> 36:10.627
Maybe come down
or something.

36:10.668 --> 36:14.536
l gotta be up in the morning.
l got my fucking biopsy.

36:14.572 --> 36:17.006
All right,
l'll take care of it.

36:20.845 --> 36:23.279
Now's your last chance
to take advantage...

36:23.314 --> 36:25.282
One second
you're sitting there

36:25.316 --> 36:27.284
enjoying a ride
with your family,

36:27.318 --> 36:29.650
the next your entire
world comes crashing down.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.853
l close my eyes.
l can still hear the screams.

36:32.890 --> 36:35.825
We should all be
thankful it's okay.

36:35.860 --> 36:37.828
My baby could have
been killed, Tony.

36:37.862 --> 36:39.853
God forbid.

36:41.365 --> 36:44.357
You can bet the locals
will be parading in with their lawsuits.

36:44.402 --> 36:46.529
El mucho pesos.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.408
Just leave it alone,
Janice.

36:54.912 --> 36:57.278
They are entitled
to damages.

36:57.315 --> 36:59.442
Obviously,
there was negligence.

36:59.483 --> 37:02.782
Good, so then they'll have excuses
why they can't go to work.

37:02.820 --> 37:04.845
When l think what
could have happened

37:04.889 --> 37:06.982
to my baby...

37:07.024 --> 37:09.219
Oh yes, you, Nica.

37:09.260 --> 37:11.421
l'm talking
about you, angel.

37:11.462 --> 37:13.054
Oh, God, l wanna
bite those cheeks.

37:13.097 --> 37:16.965
Scumbag hillbilly,
l should have kicked his ass.

37:17.001 --> 37:19.902
Yeah, and what
did you do? Nothing.

37:19.937 --> 37:22.303
l was taking Sophia
to the bathroom.

37:28.412 --> 37:31.711
Mmm, this wine,
Tony, you're right.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.410
Delicious.

37:35.119 --> 37:38.247
l was just thinking
it lost some of its...

37:38.289 --> 37:41.486
l don't know-- pop.

37:53.137 --> 37:55.105
Manager.
You gotta move your car.

37:55.139 --> 37:57.733
l said l'm coming.

38:03.147 --> 38:06.446
You redneck fuck. My baby was
on that ride with my wife.

38:06.484 --> 38:09.078
She woke up this morning,
she could barely move her neck.

38:09.120 --> 38:12.749
l told the cops, mister. l'm sorry.
lnsurance will pay your hospital bill.

38:12.790 --> 38:16.317
- $25,000 cash.
- What?

38:16.360 --> 38:18.419
New Jersey has stringent
liability laws.

38:18.462 --> 38:20.453
l told the guy who hired me
l'd have to put on

38:20.498 --> 38:23.467
a whole repair crew, work 'em all night.
He wouldn't spring for it.

38:23.501 --> 38:25.901
Who, Paulie?
What are you talking about?

38:25.936 --> 38:28.029
First off, he wouldn't
pay for my ''A'' fleet.

38:28.072 --> 38:31.007
l leased that to the Sorghum Festival
down in Atlanta.

38:32.443 --> 38:35.469
Okay, the results
of the steroid test are in.

38:35.513 --> 38:38.380
The contestants,
they're all clean.

38:39.684 --> 38:41.652
l want a fair
contest here.

38:41.686 --> 38:44.314
No biting each other.

38:44.355 --> 38:47.722
Ready, set, mangia.

38:50.828 --> 38:54.286
Man, we got some race
going on over here, ladies and gents.

38:54.332 --> 38:55.993
Look at 'em go.

38:56.033 --> 38:58.695
Hey, cocksucker!

38:58.736 --> 39:02.502
You hire some fly-by-night
piece of shit and you don't tell nobody?

39:02.540 --> 39:04.667
- Whoa, Bobby.
- What the fuck you talking about?

39:04.709 --> 39:06.336
You know what l'm talking
about, you cheap fuck!

39:06.377 --> 39:08.368
Bobby, come on!

39:08.412 --> 39:11.108
Everybody wants to get rich,
but you don't scrimp on safety.

39:11.148 --> 39:14.481
- Mind your business, Bobby.
- My baby girl was in that car!

39:14.518 --> 39:17.009
- You owe me money, Paulie.
- l owe you shit.

39:17.054 --> 39:19.454
- My wife's got nerve damage!
- Fuck her, too!

39:19.490 --> 39:21.515
- Get the fuck off me!
- Easy, easy.

39:21.559 --> 39:25.552
Calm down.
Keep moving.

39:33.104 --> 39:36.835
Go ahead, it's over.
Crown the winner.

39:36.874 --> 39:39.570
l was at the feast,
St. Elzear's.

39:39.610 --> 39:42.579
The thing for us kids was
to blow powdered sugar

39:42.613 --> 39:45.275
on each other
from the zeppoles.

39:48.452 --> 39:52.013
Thousands of people
either praying or eating.

39:53.524 --> 39:56.925
Anyway, my sister
was on this ride

39:56.961 --> 39:59.953
with my niece
when it lurched forward

39:59.997 --> 40:02.431
- pretty bad.
- God.

40:02.466 --> 40:05.196
He wasn't there,
just Elzear.

40:05.236 --> 40:07.568
But he was so busy
getting money pinned to his ass

40:07.605 --> 40:10.574
that he got distracted
and a bolt snapped.

40:10.608 --> 40:12.906
Were they hurt?

40:12.943 --> 40:14.934
You look around, all these people
are lined up for this shit.

40:14.979 --> 40:18.107
The kids, adults,
families.

40:18.149 --> 40:19.946
Rides.

40:19.984 --> 40:22.418
Yeah, they pay money
so they can almost puke.

40:22.453 --> 40:24.546
They scream, they yell.

40:24.588 --> 40:26.920
Why do you think that is?

40:26.957 --> 40:28.982
They're bored.

40:30.494 --> 40:32.485
Are you bored?

40:39.403 --> 40:41.394
Am l bored?

40:43.774 --> 40:46.675
l got shot in the pancreas
and l recovered.

40:46.710 --> 40:48.735
No brain damage
from the septic shock,

40:48.779 --> 40:51.475
like everybody
figured l'd have.

40:51.515 --> 40:55.281
You know my feelings.
Every day is a gift.

40:56.420 --> 40:58.047
lt's just...

40:58.088 --> 41:02.024
does it have to be
a pair of socks?

41:05.996 --> 41:08.658
l'm joking.

41:08.699 --> 41:11.634
l'm joking.

41:18.642 --> 41:20.439
Well, what are
you gonna do?

41:20.478 --> 41:22.503
lt's the human
condition.

41:22.546 --> 41:24.480
What is?

41:28.719 --> 41:30.778
l don't know.

41:30.821 --> 41:32.789
Yeah, this is Peter Gaultieri.

41:32.823 --> 41:35.314
l'm calling for the result
of my biopsy again.

41:35.359 --> 41:37.827
l'm sorry, sir.
They're still not in.

41:37.862 --> 41:39.955
This is cancer
we're talking about.

41:39.997 --> 41:43.524
l understand, sir.
You'll have to call back tomorrow.

41:51.542 --> 41:53.510
Gimme an espresso...

41:53.544 --> 41:56.240
and don't touch
the lemon rind with your fingers.

42:00.918 --> 42:02.886
Hello, Paulie.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.888
What are you
doing here?

42:04.922 --> 42:08.221
The home. lt's one
of our outings.

42:08.259 --> 42:10.022
So you're still
over there, huh?

42:10.060 --> 42:12.221
They've been very nice,

42:12.263 --> 42:15.323
and your brother's
trying to work out an arrangement.

42:15.366 --> 42:18.494
ls it true
what they're saying?

42:19.503 --> 42:21.994
Who? About what?

42:22.039 --> 42:23.768
The ride,
the one that broke.

42:26.377 --> 42:28.470
You need to make
a novena, Paulie.

42:28.512 --> 42:31.242
- Those poor children.
- What are you talking about?

42:31.282 --> 42:34.547
You let St. Elzear
go without his hat.

42:34.585 --> 42:37.076
Will you listen to this?
Fuck that voodoo, huh?

42:37.121 --> 42:40.022
You cursed your mother,
a blessed nun.

42:40.057 --> 42:42.025
She had it coming.
You both did.

42:42.059 --> 42:44.527
l didn't bring
you up like that.

42:44.562 --> 42:46.757
You're a fake.
That's how you brung me up.

42:46.797 --> 42:48.788
Fuck the two of you.

42:51.802 --> 42:53.201
Sir, your espresso.

42:56.941 --> 43:00.570
So in keeping with this
longstanding tradition

43:00.611 --> 43:04.103
of doing everything
ass-fucking-backwards,

43:04.148 --> 43:06.275
we are gathered here tonight
for the bachelor party

43:06.317 --> 43:09.377
of already-married man
Christopher Moltisanti.

43:12.456 --> 43:14.856
And like l always say,

43:14.892 --> 43:17.087
a man is not complete
till he's married.

43:17.127 --> 43:19.322
Then he's finished.

43:21.432 --> 43:23.297
Chrissy.

43:23.334 --> 43:26.098
- Congratulations. T.
- Thanks.

43:41.151 --> 43:42.914
Should we order?

43:42.953 --> 43:46.354
- Yeah, what the fuck are the specials?
- Artie.

43:50.628 --> 43:54.120
l gotta go, Ton'.
The kids.

43:56.934 --> 43:59.801
- Have fun tonight, huh?
- All right.

44:01.338 --> 44:04.239
- Specials, gentlemen.
- Pray tell, my good man.

44:04.274 --> 44:07.641
l got lamb tonight, grilled, garlic,
little rosemary.

44:07.678 --> 44:09.612
Rosemary,
l'll eat her.

44:18.255 --> 44:20.416
Hey, T.

44:20.457 --> 44:22.516
You're doing a heck
of a job there, Brownie.

44:22.559 --> 44:25.357
Huh?

44:25.396 --> 44:27.591
This thing with the ride,
the shit with Bobby,

44:27.631 --> 44:29.724
you settle it
and you settle it now.

44:29.767 --> 44:32.201
And not just 'cause
she's my sister, either.

44:32.236 --> 44:34.204
- Ton', l--
- You put little kids in jeopardy

44:34.238 --> 44:36.900
at the hands of some
fucking redneck?

44:36.940 --> 44:39.636
Not to mention you leave Little Paulie
alone to deal with the cops.

44:39.677 --> 44:43.010
l thought he had it
under control.

44:43.047 --> 44:45.015
Let me ask you a question
about the feast.

44:45.049 --> 44:47.210
Do we need
negative press?

44:47.251 --> 44:49.151
With all the competition
out there

44:49.186 --> 44:51.154
for the entertainment
dollar, DVDs,

44:51.188 --> 44:53.520
the lnternet?

44:53.557 --> 44:55.650
You're right, Ton'.

44:58.195 --> 45:00.163
What happened to
the regular ride guy,

45:00.197 --> 45:02.631
the guy we used
last year?

45:02.666 --> 45:05.965
For what he wanted to charge,
l'm getting killed here, Ton'.

45:06.003 --> 45:07.994
When your dad
had St. Elzear's,

45:08.038 --> 45:10.029
it was a cash cow,
and it was easy.

45:10.074 --> 45:12.042
Nowadays, between
paying the church,

45:12.076 --> 45:13.703
these Puerto Ricans now,

45:13.744 --> 45:16.008
ha, my profit's
shrunk to nothing.

45:16.046 --> 45:18.276
lf it don't work
as a business, get rid of it.

45:18.315 --> 45:21.250
Not for nothing, but a lot of that feast
goes in your pocket.

45:22.352 --> 45:25.344
l got a lot
on my mind, T.

45:25.389 --> 45:28.517
- l'm sorry.
- Like what?

45:28.559 --> 45:31.756
l had a biopsy.

45:31.795 --> 45:34.355
l might have
prostate cancer.

45:36.200 --> 45:38.998
Well, it's a biopsy,
right?

45:39.036 --> 45:41.504
Nine times out of 10,
these things come back clean.

45:41.538 --> 45:44.837
- l don't know.
- What don't you know?

45:44.875 --> 45:48.333
Don't work yourself
up into a state like you do, hmm?

45:48.378 --> 45:50.539
l've been
having headaches.

45:50.581 --> 45:53.744
l'm afraid maybe the thing
metastasized.

45:53.784 --> 45:56.184
Jesus, will you
listen to yourself, huh?

45:56.220 --> 45:59.883
With all your weird fucking shit about
your body and the germophobias.

45:59.923 --> 46:03.689
- You don't know shit yet.
- lt's true.

46:03.727 --> 46:06.594
l'd rather face 10 guys
with shivs than something l can't see.

46:06.630 --> 46:09.497
Exactly. You're too
susceptible to the psychics

46:09.533 --> 46:12.400
and the dream messages
and dirty fucking toilet seats.

46:12.436 --> 46:14.495
lt's a biopsy.

46:14.538 --> 46:16.699
Get a grip.

46:16.740 --> 46:19.402
You're right, T.

46:19.443 --> 46:22.469
You know, and negative
thinking can help bring this shit on.

46:22.513 --> 46:26.540
Work something out
with Bobby, huh?

46:26.583 --> 46:28.710
And Eddie Lind's coming down
from Pennsylvania with an envelope.

46:28.752 --> 46:30.720
Meet him at the Bing.

46:30.754 --> 46:33.120
You call him,
you set up a time.

46:40.130 --> 46:42.860
There he is,
the bad lieutenant.

46:42.900 --> 46:44.458
Hey.

46:47.471 --> 46:49.336
l sold mine.

46:49.373 --> 46:52.672
$300 for the five cases.

47:00.617 --> 47:03.347
Oh, l had a heater
put in the Bloomfield wire room.

47:03.387 --> 47:05.617
Guys were complaining.

47:05.656 --> 47:08.056
Well, good.

47:08.091 --> 47:10.855
Yeah, yeah,
that's good.

47:18.001 --> 47:19.992
What's new with you?

47:20.037 --> 47:22.301
Copacetic.

47:34.685 --> 47:36.983
''We're with the Vipers.''

47:42.092 --> 47:44.788
- Fun night.
- Fuckin' A.

47:46.230 --> 47:49.324
''Take it easy.
Take it easy.''

47:49.366 --> 47:52.199
10-4.

47:52.236 --> 47:55.399
You remember the look
on the other guy's face?

47:55.439 --> 47:58.636
Oh, the fucking
Grizzly Adams douchebag.

48:06.984 --> 48:10.078
Yeah.

48:24.101 --> 48:26.069
Dr. Cipolla's service.

48:26.103 --> 48:27.934
l need to talk
to the doctor.

48:27.971 --> 48:29.871
- ls this an emergency?
- Of course.

48:29.907 --> 48:32.501
Dr. Cipolla's out of town.
Dr. Paglieri's on call.

48:32.542 --> 48:34.533
Do you wanna
be connected?

48:34.578 --> 48:36.603
Nah.

49:20.991 --> 49:23.926
Hey, buddy boy,
how you doing?

49:23.961 --> 49:26.657
Any of the girls
working yet?

49:29.933 --> 49:33.164
- Last day already. God, it goes fast.
- Yeah.

49:33.203 --> 49:35.933
St. Anthony's
the week after next.

49:35.973 --> 49:38.498
What's the matter, baby?

49:41.244 --> 49:44.805
Can you believe this? After all this,
she wants to go back on that ride.

49:44.848 --> 49:46.816
She cried
for three nights after.

49:46.850 --> 49:49.216
The ride's closed, baby.

49:49.252 --> 49:51.743
Hey, show everybody
how you can walk.

49:51.788 --> 49:53.756
Come on,
they wanna see.

49:53.790 --> 49:55.257
Okay, show 'em.

49:55.292 --> 49:58.090
Show everybody
how you can walk.

49:58.128 --> 49:59.857
Show 'em.

50:05.969 --> 50:08.699
Baby, come here, baby.
Come on.

50:08.739 --> 50:11.537
Have some candy.
Look, Cracker Jack.

50:13.677 --> 50:16.111
Here you go.

50:22.552 --> 50:24.611
Come on.

50:24.654 --> 50:26.645
Whoo!

50:33.663 --> 50:36.996
Whoa!

50:37.034 --> 50:38.729
Where's our belly?

50:44.508 --> 50:46.032
As you can tell
by this outfit, folks,

50:46.076 --> 50:49.136
l've picked out something
with a little Norwegian flavor.

50:49.179 --> 50:52.046
l'd like to play for you
the ''Johnny Oslo Shadish.''

50:52.082 --> 50:54.573
lt's a typical Norwegian
dance, and who could do it better

50:54.618 --> 50:57.143
than Bobby and Cissy?

51:07.297 --> 51:09.765
