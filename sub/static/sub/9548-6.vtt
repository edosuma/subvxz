WEBVTT

00:09.470 --> 00:10.990
Taxi, taxi!

00:11.340 --> 00:12.520
Come on.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.090
It's freezing.

00:14.090 --> 00:15.629
Yeah, it is cold out here.

00:15.630 --> 00:17.009
That's all right. we'll get one.

00:17.010 --> 00:17.909
I'm good at getting cabs.

00:17.910 --> 00:20.090
I'm kinda like the cab whisperer.

00:21.220 --> 00:22.699
That's a nice blazer.

00:22.700 --> 00:24.179
Thank you very much.

00:24.180 --> 00:26.149
It's a gift from, uh-- well, from me.

00:26.150 --> 00:27.799
I wish I'd taken the lining out of it, though.

00:27.800 --> 00:29.329
Sometimes it gets really hot.

00:29.330 --> 00:30.580
Really?

00:33.510 --> 00:34.509
You're shivering.

00:34.510 --> 00:35.409
You noticed.

00:35.410 --> 00:37.729
Well, I notice everything. thank you.

00:37.730 --> 00:39.159
That's my job. I'm a good cop.

00:39.160 --> 00:40.649
Oh, oh, there's a taxi!

00:40.650 --> 00:41.069
There's one. there's one.

00:41.070 --> 00:43.960
Right, right. hey! taxi, taxi!

00:44.080 --> 00:45.320
Taxi!

00:48.050 --> 00:50.420
We got it, we got it, we got it.

00:51.340 --> 00:52.990
Thanks for waiting, man.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.680
Uh, 88 underhill avenue, please.

00:59.980 --> 01:01.220
You're my hero.

01:01.430 --> 01:02.919
Do you want your coat back?

01:02.920 --> 01:05.670
Uh, no, why don't you keep it. I'll get it in the morning.

01:06.150 --> 01:07.679
You're pretty sure of yourself, huh?

01:07.680 --> 01:09.549
Uh, well, I am a cop.

01:09.550 --> 01:11.139
I read the situation.

01:11.140 --> 01:12.149
It's all in the details.

01:12.150 --> 01:16.280
Noticing all those little things that other people miss.

01:16.360 --> 01:17.550
For example,

01:18.420 --> 01:20.550
You usually wear glasses.

01:21.470 --> 01:23.470
I saw you squinting at the menu.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.399
You're pretty good.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.219
Yeah...

01:26.220 --> 01:28.680
Well, I've been doing it for years.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.809
It's second nature by now.

01:30.810 --> 01:32.230
We're not moving.

01:32.850 --> 01:34.710
Randy, oh my god!

01:40.680 --> 01:42.350
It's a jungle out there

01:43.180 --> 01:46.720
Disorder and confusion everywhere

01:47.800 --> 01:49.800
No one seems to care

01:49.970 --> 01:50.900
Well I do

01:50.980 --> 01:53.800
Hey, who's in charge here?

01:54.030 --> 01:56.230
It's a jungle out there

01:57.880 --> 02:00.650
Poison in the very air we breathe

02:01.060 --> 02:03.510
Do you know what's in the water that you drink?

02:03.510 --> 02:07.490
Well I do, and it's amazing

02:07.880 --> 02:10.949
People think I'm crazy, 'cause I worry all the time

02:11.280 --> 02:13.850
If you paid attention, you'd be worried too

02:14.580 --> 02:15.790
You better pay attention

02:15.790 --> 02:22.130
Or this world we love so much might just kill you

02:22.640 --> 02:26.440
I could be wrong now, but I don't think so

02:26.760 --> 02:28.420
It's a jungle out there

02:29.000 --> 02:31.420
It's a jungle out there

02:35.720 --> 02:37.149
Let's meet our victim.

02:37.150 --> 02:39.039
He was a cab driver

02:39.040 --> 02:40.759
Named drazen mirko.

02:40.760 --> 02:42.459
Hey, Randy, does he look familiar?

02:42.460 --> 02:43.769
I was in the backseat.

02:43.770 --> 02:45.399
Mckiernan, what do you got?

02:45.400 --> 02:47.889
Not much. he got his hack license...

02:47.890 --> 02:49.369
About six years ago.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.839
Kept to himself, no known family.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.879
And we're still trying to track down his immigration papers.

02:53.880 --> 02:56.549
The coroner puts the time of death around 9:20.

02:56.550 --> 02:59.149
Multiple puncture wounds from an antique hat pin.

02:59.150 --> 03:00.380
A hat pin?

03:00.620 --> 03:01.539
Can I see that?

03:01.540 --> 03:03.719
So, we're looking for a woman...

03:03.720 --> 03:05.099
That's a start.

03:05.100 --> 03:06.979
Oh, your "l" is a little crooked, there.

03:06.980 --> 03:07.609
No, it's not.

03:07.610 --> 03:08.990
Yes, it is.

03:10.560 --> 03:11.960
It really is.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.920
It's hanging down on the bottom there.

03:19.070 --> 03:20.589
Yeah, it's still a little off.

03:20.590 --> 03:21.780
Now it's... Monk!

03:22.040 --> 03:23.709
This is a homicide task force.

03:23.710 --> 03:24.639
You want me to run downstairs

03:24.640 --> 03:25.569
And get a t-square

03:25.570 --> 03:27.459
So all the letters are even?

03:27.460 --> 03:28.699
It doesn't have to be you necessarily.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.540
You could send... Monk!

03:31.580 --> 03:32.769
Could we move on?

03:32.770 --> 03:34.970
So what is this, a family crest?

03:35.060 --> 03:35.979
Yeah, yeah. something like that.

03:35.980 --> 03:38.470
We're still working on it.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.259
Are there any witnesses?

03:40.260 --> 03:42.049
Randy was there, so...

03:42.050 --> 03:44.209
No, there weren't any witnesses.

03:44.210 --> 03:46.469
I wasn't in cop mode. I was in date mode.

03:46.470 --> 03:47.989
We found this in the cab.

03:47.990 --> 03:49.129
It's got a design on it.

03:49.130 --> 03:50.619
Could be an invitation or something.

03:50.620 --> 03:52.299
And we found this

03:52.300 --> 03:53.319
Under the backseat.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.599
There's blood splatter on it.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.510
We think the killer was wearing it.

03:56.660 --> 03:58.349
A charm bracelet.

03:58.350 --> 04:00.180
Trudy had one of these.

04:00.490 --> 04:04.139
Usually, these aren't just decorative.

04:04.140 --> 04:05.829
Each one of these little charms

04:05.830 --> 04:07.349
Could mean something.

04:07.350 --> 04:08.219
"l.z."

04:08.220 --> 04:09.659
Probably her initials.

04:09.660 --> 04:11.549
L.z. that's good.

04:11.550 --> 04:13.629
There can't be a lot of zs out there.

04:13.630 --> 04:14.309
Ballet slippers.

04:14.310 --> 04:16.469
Maybe she's a dancer or used to be.

04:16.470 --> 04:17.709
Yeah, that's good.

04:17.709 --> 04:19.579
There's a man with a beard.

04:19.610 --> 04:21.159
Looks like santa claus.

04:21.160 --> 04:23.029
Maybe she likes christmas!

04:23.030 --> 04:25.219
I'm not going to write down that she likes christmas.

04:25.220 --> 04:26.499
He is carrying something,

04:26.500 --> 04:28.699
Could be St. Christopher.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.349
He's the patron saint

04:29.350 --> 04:31.140
Of travelers.

04:31.190 --> 04:32.290
Okay.

04:32.450 --> 04:34.210
Likes to travel.

04:34.910 --> 04:36.029
What is that? a lion?

04:36.030 --> 04:38.349
Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo...zookeeper!

04:38.350 --> 04:40.279
A traveling, dancing zookeeper.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.229
This is not a game show, Randy.

04:42.230 --> 04:42.839
Well, it could be...

04:42.840 --> 04:45.539
An astrological sign. so she's a leo.

04:45.540 --> 04:47.209
A leo. what is that?

04:47.210 --> 04:48.549
Looks like a ruby! yeah.

04:48.550 --> 04:49.769
Rubies, so that's jewelry.

04:49.770 --> 04:50.649
She makes jewelry.

04:50.650 --> 04:51.980
She's a dancing

04:52.000 --> 04:54.399
Zookeeper's daughter who makes jewelry!

04:54.400 --> 04:55.699
Okay! I'm making an announcement.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.419
If our suspect turns out to be

04:57.420 --> 04:59.569
A dancing zookeeper's daughter who makes jewelry,

04:59.570 --> 05:00.840
I'm gonna retire.

05:00.910 --> 05:02.879
Well, it could be a birthstone, right?

05:02.880 --> 05:04.190
What is ruby?

05:04.420 --> 05:05.259
Uh, my mom wears one.

05:05.260 --> 05:06.809
A ruby is july.

05:06.810 --> 05:08.299
If she's a leo that was born in july,

05:08.300 --> 05:10.389
That narrows it down to nine days

05:10.390 --> 05:12.919
Between july 23rd and the 31st.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.009
Alright, here's what we know.

05:14.010 --> 05:16.990
We're looking for a woman whose initials are l.z.,

05:17.000 --> 05:18.510
Maybe she's a dancer. She likes to travel 

05:18.510 --> 05:20.350
Or works with people who travel,

05:20.400 --> 05:21.189
And she was born between

05:21.190 --> 05:23.860
July 23rd and july 31st.

05:24.320 --> 05:25.930
I can't think of anyone.

05:27.600 --> 05:29.119
I thought maybe we'd use the computer

05:29.120 --> 05:30.620
For this one, Randy.

05:31.110 --> 05:32.300
That's a good idea.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.509
Sanchez and Mckiernan

05:38.510 --> 05:40.910
Are checking out the woman in sausalito.

05:41.290 --> 05:42.429
The other one works here.

05:42.430 --> 05:46.150
Her name is Leyla Zlatavich.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.010
You got that dmv photo?

05:48.010 --> 05:49.430
These poor people!

05:49.770 --> 05:52.219
They're all refugees... from Zemenia.

05:52.220 --> 05:53.539
Are they still fighting over there?

05:53.540 --> 05:55.409
They haven't stopped fighting for 600 years.

05:55.410 --> 05:58.279
These are the lucky ones; these people got out.

05:58.280 --> 05:59.830
Captain, over there.

06:04.260 --> 06:05.729
We found you a house.

06:07.990 --> 06:09.330
No, no, no.

06:09.540 --> 06:11.389
No room, a house

06:11.390 --> 06:13.129
With a backyard and a garden.

06:13.130 --> 06:14.420
Your own garden!

06:14.960 --> 06:17.879
No, no, no. everything is paid for.

06:17.880 --> 06:20.839
All we have to do now is fill out some residency papers.

06:20.840 --> 06:23.270
So you come with me? please.

06:25.470 --> 06:27.130
Please, come.

06:31.300 --> 06:32.660
She's beautiful.

06:33.410 --> 06:35.089
Hmm, like mother theresa.

06:35.090 --> 06:36.270
Only hotter.

06:36.330 --> 06:37.460
"only hotter"?

06:37.600 --> 06:39.510
You're gonna get hit by lightning.

06:39.660 --> 06:41.090
She didn't do it.

06:42.450 --> 06:43.189
How do you know that?

06:43.190 --> 06:45.110
We haven't even talked to her yet.

06:46.370 --> 06:47.249
This is Disher.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.680
Captain, it's Sanchez.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:03.410 --> 07:04.540
Uh.

07:04.720 --> 07:09.370
Flag was falling.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.200
Falling.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.020
That's good!

07:12.940 --> 07:14.379
Your english is really good.

07:14.380 --> 07:16.030
Keep practicing.

07:17.600 --> 07:18.980
You're frightened.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.210
I can tell.

07:20.710 --> 07:21.989
But you're safe here.

07:21.990 --> 07:23.009
Everything Will be all right.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.410
Do you underStand?

07:24.510 --> 07:25.889
We'll get you some clothes

07:25.890 --> 07:27.560
So you can fit in.

07:27.870 --> 07:29.879
No one is going to laugh at you anymore.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.320
Would you like that?

07:33.620 --> 07:35.030
Would you like some water?

07:37.530 --> 07:39.060
I'll be right back.

07:46.580 --> 07:47.850
What did she say?

07:48.320 --> 07:49.700
She's not the guy.

07:50.070 --> 07:50.869
Well, you keep saying that. But how do you know?

07:51.750 --> 07:53.360
Captain, check this out.

07:53.730 --> 07:55.379
It's from the collection box.

07:55.380 --> 07:57.290
A Zemenian ten dollar bill.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.110
That's the piece of paper we found in the cab.

08:02.630 --> 08:03.899
Nobody bats a thousand, Monk.

08:03.900 --> 08:04.809
That's a perfect match.

08:04.810 --> 08:06.210
What? perfect?

08:06.450 --> 08:08.059
You don't know that it's perfect.

08:08.060 --> 08:10.459
Don't you think I'd be the one to know if it's perfect?

08:10.460 --> 08:11.639
Well, it's not.

08:11.640 --> 08:12.820
Probably.

08:14.920 --> 08:17.290
We'll go to the lab and make sure it's perfect.

08:21.250 --> 08:22.059
Are you okay?

08:22.060 --> 08:23.769
You look a little flushed to me.

08:23.770 --> 08:25.010
What?

08:28.120 --> 08:30.240
You're--you're blushing!

08:30.570 --> 08:31.859
No, what are--

08:31.860 --> 08:33.740
What are you talking about?

08:36.090 --> 08:37.320
Oh, my god!

08:37.440 --> 08:38.780
You like her!

08:39.049 --> 08:40.208
What? stop it!

08:40.210 --> 08:41.958
That's crazy talk! you're staring right at her.

08:41.960 --> 08:43.130
No!

08:43.270 --> 08:46.159
I'm looking at... over there.

08:46.160 --> 08:47.289
All right, yes.

08:47.290 --> 08:48.549
I'm looking at her.

08:48.550 --> 08:51.599
Okay, because she fits the profile.

08:51.600 --> 08:52.969
But she didn't do it.

08:52.970 --> 08:54.239
I'll go wait in the car.

08:54.240 --> 08:55.519
And she didn't do it!

08:55.520 --> 08:58.240
And that scrap of paper doesn't mean a thing.

08:57.840 --> 08:58.520
You like her.

08:58.430 --> 09:00.969
I don't like her. and don't say that again!

09:00.970 --> 09:03.290
I don't like anybody. I'm gonna wait in the car.

09:10.610 --> 09:14.060
As you can see, all roads lead to our suspect,

09:14.060 --> 09:15.590
Leyla zlatavich.

09:16.130 --> 09:17.909
Monk, you can shake your head all you want to,

09:17.910 --> 09:20.009
But you're not going to shake all of this away.

09:20.010 --> 09:22.240
All the charms on the bracelet match.

09:22.120 --> 09:23.550
Her initials,

09:23.060 --> 09:23.819
Her birthday--

09:23.820 --> 09:26.130
She works with travelers, she used to dance.

09:26.220 --> 09:28.320
And if that's not enough, and it is,

09:28.440 --> 09:31.350
Zemenian currency at the scene.

09:31.350 --> 09:33.169
It's not enough. I don't believe this.

09:33.170 --> 09:35.320
Monk, it's more than enough!

09:35.580 --> 09:38.209
Look, last year we got that conviction on that guy

09:38.210 --> 09:40.669
By virtue of the air he blew into a beach ball.

09:40.670 --> 09:42.889
If we're gonna pick her up, we need to move on her now.

09:42.890 --> 09:43.959
I mean, she could be a flight risk.

09:43.960 --> 09:44.779
Yeah. wait!

09:44.780 --> 09:47.189
Wait, wait, wait.

09:47.190 --> 09:49.040
Wait. let me think.

10:01.350 --> 10:02.309
Where's the motive?

10:02.310 --> 10:03.810
You need a motive.

10:03.850 --> 10:05.619
She had the oldest motive in the world.

10:05.620 --> 10:06.890
She wanted cash.

10:07.230 --> 10:08.919
But the cabbie still had his wallet!

10:08.920 --> 10:11.139
She was interrupted... by lt. Disher.

10:11.140 --> 10:13.299
She didn't realize he was still in date mode.

10:13.300 --> 10:14.219
She ran away.

10:14.220 --> 10:16.029
Okay, wait--what about the other suspect?

10:16.030 --> 10:18.669
You said there were two women who fit the profile. we checked.

10:18.670 --> 10:21.090
The other woman's been dead for seven years.

10:21.270 --> 10:23.839
Whoa, whoa, whoa. wait, wait.

10:23.840 --> 10:25.349
Wait, whoa. hm. interesting, right?

10:25.350 --> 10:27.850
It's fascinating, really. let's look at this.

10:30.890 --> 10:33.879
Wow. a woman who's been dead for seven years...

10:33.880 --> 10:35.479
Hails a taxi,

10:35.480 --> 10:37.209
Kills the driver,

10:37.210 --> 10:38.860
And then-- Monk,

10:39.170 --> 10:40.470
She's the guy.

10:40.710 --> 10:41.659
Leyla's the guy.

10:41.660 --> 10:42.799
But she's not the guy.

10:42.800 --> 10:44.979
Okay. let's put it to a vote.

10:44.980 --> 10:48.100
All those who think we should bring ms. Zlatavich in?

10:48.530 --> 10:49.790
Those opposed?

10:51.210 --> 10:52.289
You cannot vote, Monk!

10:52.290 --> 10:52.949
Why not?

10:52.950 --> 10:55.279
Because you obviously have a crush on this woman.

10:55.280 --> 10:58.860
What? what? that's insane!

10:59.790 --> 11:01.829
How could I like her? I'm a married man.

11:01.830 --> 11:04.269
I have not taken this off in 18 years.

11:04.270 --> 11:06.329
I love my wife. everybody knows that!

11:06.330 --> 11:09.890
You can all go to... you know where.

11:12.220 --> 11:13.400
Hell.

11:16.560 --> 11:18.789
No, Will, it's no problem at all.

11:18.790 --> 11:20.689
All right. we'll see you soon.

11:20.690 --> 11:21.760
Bye.

11:22.220 --> 11:24.899
Mr. Monk, don't freak out.

11:24.900 --> 11:26.280
That was Leyla.

11:26.490 --> 11:28.649
Really? she wants to talk to you about the case.

11:28.650 --> 11:30.199
She sounded upset.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.410
She sounded scared, actually.

11:32.480 --> 11:34.479
I don't know. I think she might be innocent.

11:34.480 --> 11:36.819
Of course she's innocent. that's what I've been saying.

11:36.820 --> 11:38.049
Well, she's just up the street.

11:38.050 --> 11:39.880
She's gonna be here in two minutes.

11:41.420 --> 11:42.610
Two minutes.

11:42.760 --> 11:44.150
She's coming here.

11:46.920 --> 11:48.839
In two minutes, she's coming here.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.730
Yeah, you just said that.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.679
You're excited. I can tell.

11:53.680 --> 11:55.419
Who's excited? I'm not excited.

11:55.420 --> 11:57.239
You're the one who's excited.

11:57.240 --> 11:59.990
You obviously can't stop thinking about her.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.669
I think you might be obsessed with this woman,

12:01.670 --> 12:03.659
The way you keep talking about her.

12:03.660 --> 12:04.709
I'm not talking about her.

12:04.710 --> 12:05.689
Well, you're listening about her.

12:05.690 --> 12:07.810
You can't deny that.

12:10.600 --> 12:11.660
Are you okay?

12:11.660 --> 12:13.960
I'm fine. it's no big deal.

12:14.560 --> 12:15.930
She's...

12:16.190 --> 12:17.920
Just another client.

12:23.660 --> 12:24.820
Natalie.

12:26.050 --> 12:27.830
Mr. Monk.

12:28.040 --> 12:30.249
I'm very sorry to bother you at home.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.369
Bother?

12:31.370 --> 12:32.339
It's no bother.

12:32.340 --> 12:34.269
It only bothers me that it bothers you

12:34.270 --> 12:37.389
Because you think it bothers me, which it doesn't.

12:37.390 --> 12:38.999
You know, bother me.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.889
Would you like to sit down? yes, thank you.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.100
Not you!

12:44.120 --> 12:45.109
I feel so foolish.

12:45.110 --> 12:47.219
I didn't recognize you when we spoke yesterday

12:47.220 --> 12:48.239
At the refugee center.

12:48.240 --> 12:50.039
You are the famous detective.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.430
Today, some policemen came.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.599
They brought me to the police station.

12:57.600 --> 12:59.510
They asked me a lot of questions.

12:59.990 --> 13:01.449
They think I'm a suspect.

13:01.450 --> 13:03.219
They think I killed a taxi driver.

13:03.220 --> 13:05.750
How could they think that? I don't underStand.

13:05.950 --> 13:09.309
They only think that because of all the evidence against you.

13:09.310 --> 13:13.109
Some policemen have this thing about evidence.

13:13.110 --> 13:14.309
But I didn't kill anyone.

13:14.310 --> 13:15.319
I couldn't.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.349
I know you couldn't.

13:17.350 --> 13:19.340
We--we believe you.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.689
Mr. Monk, tell me what to do.

13:24.690 --> 13:27.079
I'd like to hire you, but I don't have much money.

13:27.080 --> 13:30.319
Don't worry about money. we don't need money.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.919
So you'll help me? yes!

13:32.920 --> 13:34.710
Of course, I Will help you.

13:35.860 --> 13:37.490
You're an angel.

13:37.850 --> 13:39.580
Thank you so much.

13:40.170 --> 13:42.529
Maybe we can talk about the case tonight?

13:42.530 --> 13:43.409
Over dinner?

13:43.410 --> 13:45.249
Tonight? yeah, okay.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.090
You have my address. tonight?

13:49.230 --> 13:50.640
8:00 okay?

13:52.450 --> 13:53.720
Thanks again.

13:54.660 --> 13:56.300
I feel much better.

14:05.710 --> 14:06.229
Mr. Monk. huh?

14:06.230 --> 14:08.280
Yeah. oh, yeah.

14:12.160 --> 14:13.429
You didn't wipe it off.

14:13.430 --> 14:14.939
Of course I did. you like her!

14:14.940 --> 14:16.099
Natalie, she's a client.

14:16.100 --> 14:18.209
Mr. Monk, it's okay to like somebody.

14:18.210 --> 14:20.180
Trudy would want you to be happy.

14:20.190 --> 14:21.040
I don't like anybody.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.289
Yeah, you keep saying that,

14:22.290 --> 14:23.359
But then you act all flustered.

14:23.360 --> 14:24.479
Not flustered.

14:24.480 --> 14:26.019
Where-- where's my silverware?

14:26.020 --> 14:27.310
You threw it out.

14:27.460 --> 14:28.950
Why would I do that?

14:31.600 --> 14:32.359
Okay, fine.

14:32.360 --> 14:33.629
Maybe I am a little flustered.

14:33.630 --> 14:35.559
You know, I am just not used to being

14:35.560 --> 14:37.740
Around attractive women.

14:37.890 --> 14:39.970
What? What?

14:40.130 --> 14:41.159
Nothing.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.350
Oh. come on.

14:43.990 --> 14:45.910
Natalie!

14:46.270 --> 14:47.979
You're not...a girl.

14:47.980 --> 14:50.060
You're-- you're Natalie!

14:50.560 --> 14:53.459
Natalie. Nat. you're Nat.

14:53.460 --> 14:55.750
Like Natalie, right?

14:59.420 --> 15:01.290
Natalie.

15:04.820 --> 15:07.500
I made a reservation for 8:00.

15:07.590 --> 15:08.620
It's just up the street.

15:08.650 --> 15:09.880
Sounds good.

15:12.990 --> 15:15.580
Sorry. I can't help it.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.829
Don't apologize. we all have our little quirks.

15:18.830 --> 15:21.289
If we didn't, we would have been exactly the same.

15:21.290 --> 15:22.620
And how would that be?

15:22.800 --> 15:24.080
Heaven on earth.

15:26.180 --> 15:27.870
I have a little quirk.

15:27.920 --> 15:30.039
I can't go to sleep without the radio on.

15:30.040 --> 15:33.039
Wow. that is weird. you're like a freak of nature.

15:33.040 --> 15:34.630
You need help, lady.

15:39.680 --> 15:42.259
Every time I see the wall, I wanna cry.

15:42.260 --> 15:44.299
I know, it's a mess.

15:44.300 --> 15:46.269
No, I mean it's so beautiful.

15:46.270 --> 15:47.450
Exactly.

15:48.420 --> 15:50.390
I come here almost every day.

15:50.500 --> 15:52.269
A hundred different opinions,

15:52.270 --> 15:53.329
Different voices.

15:53.330 --> 15:54.869
This wall is amErica.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.119
You don't appreciate what you have here.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.540
I hope I never take it for granted.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.139
This ain't a hotel. go on, get outta here.

16:04.140 --> 16:05.129
What are you doing?

16:05.130 --> 16:06.729
You can't treat people like that.

16:06.730 --> 16:08.289
Lady, this is none of your business.

16:08.290 --> 16:09.649
This man is a human being.

16:09.650 --> 16:10.769
Barely.

16:10.770 --> 16:13.079
I know your kind. I've seen it my whole life.

16:13.080 --> 16:15.529
You're a hooligan. you're a bully!

16:15.530 --> 16:16.969
He could've had a heart attack.

16:16.970 --> 16:19.379
Lady, get outta my face before I call a cop.

16:19.380 --> 16:22.120
Hey, I'll save you the time.

16:22.130 --> 16:23.680
I am the cops.

16:24.270 --> 16:25.710
Where's your badge?

16:26.670 --> 16:28.210
I'm a former cop.

16:29.590 --> 16:31.809
You wanna know why they kicked me out?

16:31.810 --> 16:34.600
You don't wanna know why they kicked me out.

16:39.220 --> 16:40.819
Why did they kick you out?

16:40.820 --> 16:42.460
Nervous breakdown.

17:01.750 --> 17:03.230
Look at that!

17:03.850 --> 17:06.920
He's touching it with his hands!

17:07.079 --> 17:08.380
Did you see that?

17:22.810 --> 17:23.990
Okay, here we go.

17:30.780 --> 17:31.960
Did you like this?

17:32.020 --> 17:33.259
It was wonderful.

17:33.260 --> 17:36.400
It was just-- it was just wonderful.

17:36.470 --> 17:39.010
Thank you for bringing me here.

17:39.620 --> 17:41.999
So, where do you wanna eat?

17:42.000 --> 17:43.699
Oh, no, no, no. we're eating here.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.320
This is our food.

17:46.400 --> 17:48.669
Hey, I don't think so.

17:48.670 --> 17:49.809
Pezni.

17:49.810 --> 17:51.489
"pezni" means delicious.

17:51.490 --> 17:52.069
Oh, pezni...

17:52.070 --> 17:53.699
What do you think he was doing?

17:53.700 --> 17:56.280
I-i don't know. I thought it was...

17:56.500 --> 18:02.240
Some kind of way, way off-broadway cabaret-type thing.

18:02.300 --> 18:04.229
It's an old Zemenian tradition.

18:04.230 --> 18:05.549
They prepare the food in front of you

18:05.550 --> 18:06.579
To whet your appetite.

18:06.580 --> 18:07.909
Yeah, yeah.

18:07.910 --> 18:09.539
But he was juggling the food,

18:09.540 --> 18:12.219
I mean, and then it went in his hat.

18:12.220 --> 18:13.679
Then it came out of his hat.

18:13.680 --> 18:15.119
I mean, I've never seen a recipe

18:15.120 --> 18:17.810
That included the word "hat".

18:24.000 --> 18:26.359
You know what? I just remembered.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.300
I had Zemenian for lunch.

18:29.760 --> 18:32.710
Detective Monk, I don't believe you.

18:33.450 --> 18:35.840
Why don't you eat, and I'll just watch?

18:35.890 --> 18:36.939
Are you sure?

18:36.940 --> 18:39.410
I've never been more sure of anything in my life.

18:41.530 --> 18:42.710
Pizne.

18:46.150 --> 18:48.750
I never imagined that such a thing was possible...

18:48.940 --> 18:50.090
In america.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.919
To be sent to prison for something I didn't do.

18:52.920 --> 18:54.920
You are not going to prison.

18:55.130 --> 18:57.980
All we have to do is figure out what happened.

18:58.060 --> 18:59.140
Here.

18:59.320 --> 19:01.789
They found this bracelet in the taxicab.

19:01.790 --> 19:04.359
All the charms seem to point to you.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.429
It has your initials, see.

19:06.430 --> 19:07.969
Yes, the police showed this to me.

19:07.970 --> 19:09.349
Yeah. but it isn't mine.

19:09.350 --> 19:11.540
I told them I've never seen it before.

19:12.450 --> 19:13.999
What about your alibi?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.870
Where were you monday night?

19:16.070 --> 19:17.839
Monday night was my birthday.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.239
I went home alone.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.099
I turned my telephone off.

19:21.100 --> 19:24.640
Lit a candle, made a wish, went to bed early.

19:25.870 --> 19:28.170
Pretty exciting life, huh?

19:28.180 --> 19:29.830
Is--is that it?

19:29.930 --> 19:31.720
That's your alibi.

19:32.220 --> 19:34.699
That might be the worst alibi I've ever heard...

19:34.700 --> 19:36.860
Ever, in my life.

19:37.240 --> 19:38.610
Which is good.

19:39.030 --> 19:40.879
Because if you were guilty,

19:40.880 --> 19:42.419
You would have come up with something better.

19:42.420 --> 19:43.570
Right?

19:43.630 --> 19:45.800
Did you speak to anyone?

19:46.080 --> 19:49.609
Um, your roommate, or, or your boyfriend, or--

19:49.610 --> 19:50.980
I live alone.

19:50.980 --> 19:52.179
I don't have a boyfriend. no?

19:53.990 --> 19:58.690
Not everyone is as lucky as you, adrian.

19:58.840 --> 20:00.399
The way you talk about Trudy,

20:00.400 --> 20:03.130
I can tell you have something very special.

20:03.360 --> 20:06.020
Yes, we do. we're very lucky.

20:07.710 --> 20:10.060
But back to the case.

20:10.490 --> 20:12.860
Could someone be framing you?

20:12.940 --> 20:14.109
Framing?

20:14.110 --> 20:16.459
I mean, do you have any enemies?

20:16.460 --> 20:18.980
Maybe someone back in the old country.

20:19.100 --> 20:20.639
No, All I'm trying to do

20:20.640 --> 20:24.080
Is help my people find shelter, maybe job.

20:44.270 --> 20:46.430
This was my favorite song.

20:47.390 --> 20:49.220
What is it about?

20:49.370 --> 20:52.859
The words mean, "foolish child, don't you know,

20:52.860 --> 20:55.210
"the broken heart Will never mend.

20:55.620 --> 20:58.570
"a true love story has no end."

20:58.750 --> 21:00.530
That's beautiful.

21:02.700 --> 21:04.689
Last time I heard that song,

21:04.690 --> 21:06.799
It was on my 23rd birthday.

21:06.800 --> 21:09.689
We had a garden party. my father sang it for me.

21:09.690 --> 21:11.930
Aw, that's a nice memory.

21:12.190 --> 21:13.849
Two weeks later, he was dead,

21:13.850 --> 21:16.410
Along with my two brothers and my fiance.

21:16.700 --> 21:19.900
I didn't know that when I said "nice memory."

21:20.750 --> 21:22.560
All murdered.

21:22.590 --> 21:24.769
He slaughtered half of the village.

21:24.770 --> 21:26.429
Who--who did?

21:26.430 --> 21:28.250
Who?

21:29.290 --> 21:30.589
He was an animal.

21:30.590 --> 21:33.200
They call him "zemenski morderca."

21:33.330 --> 21:35.359
The "butcher of Zemenia."

21:35.360 --> 21:36.609
He's disappeared.

21:36.610 --> 21:38.699
The whole world is looking for him.

21:38.700 --> 21:42.070
His name is Korston EmErich.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.930
Who dares to speak the butcher's name?

21:45.210 --> 21:46.819
That name is never to be spoken

21:46.820 --> 21:48.270
In my restaurant!

21:48.310 --> 21:51.420
When I hear that name I want to spit.

21:52.770 --> 21:55.349
Oh, my god. call 911.

21:55.350 --> 21:57.479
Uh, call-- call 911!

21:57.480 --> 21:58.759
What are you waiting for?

21:58.760 --> 22:00.439
It's an easy number. okay.

22:00.440 --> 22:01.689
Please stay calm.

22:01.690 --> 22:02.999
It's gonna be okay.

22:03.000 --> 22:04.289
It's just a little spittle.

22:04.290 --> 22:06.269
It's a little disgusting... spittle.

22:06.270 --> 22:09.340
We're gonna need a 55-gallon drum of boiling water

22:09.800 --> 22:11.600
And some...

22:12.420 --> 22:13.700
Adrian?

22:14.350 --> 22:15.830
Are you all right?

22:15.870 --> 22:17.390
What is it?

22:18.430 --> 22:19.949
Is that him?

22:19.950 --> 22:22.670
The man you called "the butcher"?

22:24.900 --> 22:26.750
But that's the cab driver.

22:26.910 --> 22:28.589
He must've been hiding out here...

22:28.590 --> 22:30.500
In san francisco.

22:30.870 --> 22:32.449
What does it mean?

22:32.450 --> 22:35.809
It means you have a motive... if you did it.

22:35.810 --> 22:38.370
Which of course you didn't.

22:46.330 --> 22:47.709
Let's get started.

22:47.710 --> 22:50.559
We have to move on this before the press gets wind of it.

22:50.560 --> 22:51.359
Thanks to Monk,

22:51.360 --> 22:54.599
We now have the real motive of the attack.

22:54.600 --> 22:57.100
Revenge, pure and simple.

22:57.210 --> 23:01.299
Turns out that our cabbie was a war criminal

23:01.300 --> 23:02.519
Named Korston EmErich.

23:02.520 --> 23:05.299
15 years ago, he and his troops killed Zlatavich's fiance

23:05.300 --> 23:07.240
And most of her family.

23:07.740 --> 23:09.540
Can't blame her, really.

23:09.900 --> 23:12.019
Well, given the evidence that we have,

23:12.020 --> 23:13.219
We should move forward.

23:13.220 --> 23:14.119
There's not enough.

23:14.120 --> 23:15.230
It's enough, Monk.

23:14.840 --> 23:17.380
No. she didn't do it.

23:17.790 --> 23:21.310
Monk, look at the board.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.119
There's a mountain of evidence here.

23:23.120 --> 23:25.390
This is mt. kilimanjaro.

23:25.470 --> 23:26.489
It's time to arrest her.

23:26.490 --> 23:28.970
Wait! wait.

23:36.290 --> 23:38.000
Let's just...

23:39.290 --> 23:41.870
All right. let me think. let me think.

23:52.570 --> 23:53.679
According to the driver's log,

23:53.680 --> 23:56.319
EmErich picked up his last passenger at the airport.

23:56.320 --> 23:57.249
Right? so?

23:57.250 --> 24:00.449
So, what was she doing at the airport?

24:00.450 --> 24:01.539
And...

24:01.540 --> 24:04.180
How--how did she even get to the airport?

24:04.200 --> 24:06.690
I don't know. She's your girlfriend, why don't you ask her?

24:06.760 --> 24:07.549
He's afraid to ask her

24:07.550 --> 24:08.689
Because she might tell him the truth.

24:08.690 --> 24:10.709
She's playing you, man! can't you see it?

24:10.710 --> 24:12.989
But why would she kill him there?

24:12.990 --> 24:16.509
Look, the cabbie was killed on Algonquin avenue, right?

24:16.510 --> 24:18.450
Yep. Leyla,

24:18.470 --> 24:20.289
I mean, Leyla.

24:20.290 --> 24:23.250
I mean, ley--

24:24.030 --> 24:25.510
Ms. zladavich--

24:26.430 --> 24:28.449
Ms. zladavich lives three miles from there.

24:28.450 --> 24:29.889
It doesn't make any sense!

24:29.890 --> 24:31.979
It makes perfect sense, Monk.

24:31.980 --> 24:34.410
She was at the airport. who knows why?

24:34.410 --> 24:36.649
She hails a cab. she drives into town.

24:36.650 --> 24:38.469
It's a red light. she stops.

24:38.470 --> 24:40.809
Yeah. he turns around, she recognizes him.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.649
"oh, my god, it's the butcher of blah blah blah."

24:42.650 --> 24:43.879
Out comes the hat pin.

24:43.880 --> 24:45.850
She does him in the neck, Monk.

24:45.900 --> 24:47.500
I'm buyin' it.

24:47.560 --> 24:48.950
A red light?

24:49.420 --> 24:50.569
You have a problem with that?

24:50.570 --> 24:52.540
Red light, shmed light.

24:54.730 --> 24:57.720
That--that's your argument? "red light, shmed light"?

24:57.810 --> 24:59.479
It's come down to that?

24:59.480 --> 25:00.729
Okay, Monk.

25:00.730 --> 25:02.310
It's over.

25:02.700 --> 25:04.339
She has no alibi.

25:04.340 --> 25:06.390
Alibi, shmalibi.

25:06.490 --> 25:08.389
Okay, we're not getting anywhere.

25:08.390 --> 25:10.849
I say it's time to go to the shmudge

25:10.850 --> 25:12.610
And get a shmarrant.

25:16.470 --> 25:17.639
There you are.

25:17.640 --> 25:19.940
I didn't see you leaving. Where are you going?

25:19.990 --> 25:20.700
She didn't do it.

25:20.710 --> 25:23.030
I know it's confusing. I like her too.

25:23.270 --> 25:24.839
Let's go home. I'll make you some dinner.

25:24.840 --> 25:26.329
I can't go home, I have to talk to her.

25:26.330 --> 25:27.169
No, mr. Monk, you can't.

25:27.170 --> 25:29.109
I have to. no, you can't see her any more.

25:29.110 --> 25:30.319
Leyla's an official suspect.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.159
She's about to be indicted.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.059
After you left,

25:33.060 --> 25:35.409
Detectives Sanchez and Mckiernan were talking.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.460
They think you're obstructing the case.

25:37.470 --> 25:38.740
Obstructing the case?

25:38.750 --> 25:39.739
They're calling the d.a.

25:39.740 --> 25:42.390
They're filing an official complaint.

25:43.290 --> 25:45.190
I'm sorry, mr. Monk.

25:48.220 --> 25:50.359
Misha, it's okay. there are no soldiers.

25:50.360 --> 25:52.170
It's safe here.

25:52.210 --> 25:54.099
Your sponsor Will meet you there.

25:54.100 --> 25:56.259
They Will take good care of you.

25:56.260 --> 25:58.120
Here's all the information.

25:59.750 --> 26:01.399
Know how we can thank you!

26:01.400 --> 26:02.789
Enjoy your new home.

26:02.790 --> 26:04.019
Enjoy your new life.

26:04.020 --> 26:05.780
That's how to thank me.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.939
Invite me to his wedding.

26:07.940 --> 26:09.650
Oh! bus is coming.

26:34.950 --> 26:36.210
Adrian!

26:36.460 --> 26:37.619
What are you doing here?

26:37.620 --> 26:39.629
I just came to tell you that, um,

26:39.630 --> 26:41.540
I can't see you anymore.

26:41.600 --> 26:44.670
It's a legal thing, conflict of interests, and so...

26:45.570 --> 26:46.680
So...

26:46.690 --> 26:47.840
I understand.

26:48.840 --> 26:49.699
You could've just called.

26:49.700 --> 26:51.160
Why didn't you call?

26:52.360 --> 26:53.900
I don't know.

26:55.180 --> 26:57.150
I could've just called.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.379
Why didn't I just call?

27:05.910 --> 27:10.380
It's no big deal. it's no big deal.

27:10.700 --> 27:12.859
Your pants Will be dry in 20 minutes.

27:12.860 --> 27:14.739
I really appreciate this.

27:14.740 --> 27:17.190
People in need-- that's my job.

27:22.820 --> 27:24.699
Geraniums, right?

27:24.700 --> 27:26.179
Yeah, fresh geraniums every day.

27:26.180 --> 27:28.590
Something I learned from my mother.

27:28.900 --> 27:30.749
It brightens your darkest night.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.740
She was right as usual.

27:33.910 --> 27:35.269
Where is she now?

27:35.270 --> 27:37.630
Back home. she refuses to leave.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.250
That's where I get my stubbornness from.

27:41.120 --> 27:43.029
It doesn't fit? no, it's fine.

27:43.030 --> 27:44.530
It's fine.

27:47.480 --> 27:48.499
There.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.130
Nice and even.

27:51.270 --> 27:52.959
It was my fiance's.

27:52.960 --> 27:54.289
He's gone for 15 years.

27:54.290 --> 27:55.519
I don't know why I keep it.

27:55.520 --> 27:57.460
Oh. I do.

28:01.140 --> 28:03.800
So, uh, when did you move in?

28:04.040 --> 28:05.439
About a month ago.

28:05.440 --> 28:07.930
I love this building.

28:08.340 --> 28:11.299
Detective Monk, you need to call your wife.

28:11.300 --> 28:13.170
She's probably worried.

28:13.960 --> 28:16.310
She knows where I am.

28:16.710 --> 28:18.560
How?

28:20.610 --> 28:22.010
Because...

28:22.890 --> 28:25.340
She's with me all the time.

28:28.840 --> 28:31.070
That explains a lot.

28:31.070 --> 28:33.450
That explains everything.

28:34.970 --> 28:37.369
How did she-- she was killed.

28:37.370 --> 28:38.990
Car bomb.

28:39.580 --> 28:42.420
Car bombs. I know them well.

28:42.600 --> 28:43.940
I am sorry.

28:45.440 --> 28:47.909
Adrian, I have to ask you...

28:47.910 --> 28:49.279
Everyone is against me--

28:49.280 --> 28:51.859
All the evidence, all the policemen.

28:51.860 --> 28:53.670
Why do you believe me?

28:55.030 --> 28:57.730
Because you didn't do it.

28:59.170 --> 29:00.770
Thank you for that.

29:03.350 --> 29:04.559
Tchaikovsky.

29:04.560 --> 29:07.690
This is the music that made me want to dance.

29:09.140 --> 29:10.959
So whatever happened?

29:10.960 --> 29:12.689
I grew out of it.

29:12.690 --> 29:15.379
Plus, they burned down the conservatory in my village.

29:15.380 --> 29:17.930
I took that as an omen. oh.

29:18.650 --> 29:22.459
Oh, I used to be able to do this

29:22.460 --> 29:23.099
And this.

29:23.100 --> 29:26.780
Oh, when did I get so old and stiff?

29:27.230 --> 29:28.830
I need a partner.

29:29.390 --> 29:30.169
Well, it's a little late,

29:30.170 --> 29:32.499
But we could call someone.

29:32.500 --> 29:34.600
He'd have to live nearby, I guess.

29:35.660 --> 29:37.400
Give me your hand.

30:44.140 --> 30:45.760
Excuse me.

30:48.750 --> 30:50.510
Is something wrong?

30:53.810 --> 30:56.209
Do you have anything stronger than steel wool?

30:56.210 --> 30:57.880
It's my wedding ring.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.729
There's something on it.

30:59.730 --> 31:03.040
Adrian, I'm lonely too.

31:05.520 --> 31:06.939
Stop what?

31:06.940 --> 31:08.559
Being you.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.569
I have to go. i-i have to go.

31:10.570 --> 31:11.659
Adrian, it's all right.

31:11.660 --> 31:14.760
I underStand. it's all right.

31:19.600 --> 31:20.970
I'm going.

31:23.770 --> 31:25.119
Good-bye...

31:25.120 --> 31:26.930
Good-bye. Leyla.

31:28.270 --> 31:31.400
And...good luck.

31:31.820 --> 31:33.800
You know, with the...

31:37.580 --> 31:39.280
Am I still here?

31:40.320 --> 31:42.040
Why can't I go?

31:45.780 --> 31:47.399
San francisco police department.

31:47.400 --> 31:48.940
Open the door.

31:51.870 --> 31:54.930
Ms. Zlatavich, I have a search warrant.

31:59.540 --> 32:01.099
Are you ms.Zlatavich?

32:01.100 --> 32:03.200
You are duly served.

32:04.460 --> 32:06.430
Monk?

32:11.330 --> 32:13.140
Mother of mercy.

32:16.880 --> 32:17.609
Well, here's something

32:17.610 --> 32:20.100
I never thought I'd say out loud.

32:20.220 --> 32:22.280
Monk, where are your pants?

32:26.650 --> 32:28.629
Monk, you're not supposed to be here.

32:28.630 --> 32:30.149
I was just leaving.

32:30.150 --> 32:31.610
I was--

32:31.670 --> 32:33.690
Is that your wedding ring?

32:34.380 --> 32:35.480
No.

32:35.540 --> 32:37.219
Wow.

32:37.220 --> 32:40.580
Excuse me, but...wow!

32:41.100 --> 32:42.229
Captain.

32:42.230 --> 32:44.200
Is this what you were looking for?

32:47.050 --> 32:49.500
Randy, let me see that hat pin.

32:57.080 --> 32:58.870
Well, that's a perfect match.

32:59.120 --> 33:00.870
Ms. zlatavich...

33:02.790 --> 33:04.580
What is this design?

33:06.270 --> 33:08.049
This is our family crest.

33:08.050 --> 33:09.299
Would you like to tell us how

33:09.300 --> 33:11.670
Your family crest got on the murder weapon?

33:13.140 --> 33:14.579
That's the murder weapon?

33:14.580 --> 33:17.070
Hold on. she can explain this.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.710
Leyla...

33:20.740 --> 33:21.819
Yes.

33:21.820 --> 33:23.940
Yes, yes. I can explain.

33:24.530 --> 33:25.810
Go ahead.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.170
I did it!

33:29.270 --> 33:31.080
Wh--what?

33:31.180 --> 33:33.490
I killed the taxi man, just like they said.

33:33.500 --> 33:34.550
No! you didn't.

33:34.600 --> 33:36.710
No, she didn't.

33:37.090 --> 33:38.520
I did.

33:39.430 --> 33:41.930
Okay. that's your opinion.

33:42.100 --> 33:45.509
Everyone's entitled to their opinion!

33:45.510 --> 33:46.439
I killed him.

33:46.440 --> 33:48.150
I killed the butcher of Zemenia.

33:51.180 --> 33:52.610
Turn around.

33:54.820 --> 33:56.600
I'm sorry.

34:07.960 --> 34:10.369
You were in the taxi. what happened then?

34:10.370 --> 34:11.559
Like you said.

34:11.560 --> 34:14.259
He was driving, there was a red light.

34:14.260 --> 34:16.569
I turned around, and I recognized him

34:16.570 --> 34:17.438
From the village.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.219
You recognized him.

34:19.460 --> 34:21.900
It was EmErich. The butcher.

34:22.110 --> 34:23.449
I was sure of it.

34:23.449 --> 34:24.960
And then what?

34:25.190 --> 34:26.219
Like you said,

34:26.230 --> 34:28.330
I took out my hat pin.

34:28.389 --> 34:30.938
I went crazy, and I stabbed him.

34:30.940 --> 34:32.449
How many times?

34:32.889 --> 34:33.849
Two, three.

34:33.850 --> 34:36.839
I don't remember, it was just all like a--

34:36.840 --> 34:38.049
What's the word?

34:38.050 --> 34:39.670
"big blur."

34:40.250 --> 34:41.900
She didn't do it.

34:42.060 --> 34:43.789
Mr. Monk, she's confessing.

34:43.790 --> 34:46.989
Why would anyone confess if they didn't do it?

34:52.300 --> 34:53.159
Oh, hey!

34:53.159 --> 34:55.168
No hard feelings, professor?

34:55.170 --> 34:56.549
I guess we learned a lesson here, huh?

34:56.550 --> 34:57.259
Sometimes things are

34:57.260 --> 34:59.460
Exactly what they seem. we'll see.

34:59.730 --> 35:01.049
We'll see?

35:01.050 --> 35:02.669
You can't be serious.

35:02.670 --> 35:04.059
Come on, it's over, man.

35:04.060 --> 35:05.879
Here's your girlfriend's confession.

35:05.880 --> 35:06.989
Read it and weep.

35:06.990 --> 35:09.129
Hey, you wanna save us a trip?

35:09.130 --> 35:10.759
We got her personal effects.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.459
How 'bout dropping these off downstairs?

35:12.460 --> 35:13.859
Thanks.

35:13.860 --> 35:15.510
You'll get 'em next time.

35:19.050 --> 35:20.880
Read it and weep.

35:21.430 --> 35:22.999
What was I thinking?

35:23.000 --> 35:24.949
You weren't thinking, mr. Monk. you were feeling.

35:24.950 --> 35:27.170
And that's a good thing.

35:31.870 --> 35:34.969
The past 14 years, I've been...

35:34.970 --> 35:36.600
Sleepwalking.

35:37.770 --> 35:39.540
I wanted to wake up.

35:40.150 --> 35:42.329
But I was always afraid to wake up.

35:42.330 --> 35:45.050
Until you walked into that refugee center.

35:45.300 --> 35:46.850
Don't worry.

35:47.090 --> 35:49.780
It won't happen again. I learned my lesson.

35:55.430 --> 35:56.350
What is it?

35:57.210 --> 35:58.649
It's a letter.

35:58.650 --> 36:00.150
Who's it from?

36:07.220 --> 36:08.780
Her mother.

36:12.690 --> 36:14.019
Mr. Monk, how do you know she's here?

36:14.020 --> 36:16.529
This is the largest Zemenian community in the country.

36:16.530 --> 36:18.289
She was frightened, she was on foot.

36:18.290 --> 36:19.589
Where else would she go?

36:19.590 --> 36:21.240
Excuse me, sir.

36:21.250 --> 36:22.580
Hello.

36:23.040 --> 36:25.380
We're looking for a woman.

36:28.370 --> 36:29.260
Okay.

36:29.300 --> 36:30.890
Okay, here we go.

36:33.020 --> 36:34.630
Uh, yeah...

36:48.300 --> 36:49.339
This is hopeless.

36:49.340 --> 36:51.610
They don't even know their own language.

37:09.400 --> 37:10.440
What?

37:10.450 --> 37:12.080
Geraniums.

37:15.490 --> 37:16.840
Is that her?

37:17.630 --> 37:19.560
It is. that--that is her.

37:22.130 --> 37:23.820
Wait.

37:24.190 --> 37:25.869
Policia? no, no, no, no.

37:25.870 --> 37:27.109
No, we just want to talk. no, no police.

37:27.110 --> 37:28.279
No police.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.219
I'm a former police officer.

37:30.220 --> 37:32.630
I was given a psychological discharge.

37:32.890 --> 37:34.239
Do you underStand "discharge"?

37:34.240 --> 37:35.289
You don't--discharge?

37:35.290 --> 37:36.399
We're friends of Leyla's.

37:36.400 --> 37:37.819
"discharge." Leyla.

37:37.820 --> 37:40.080
She's in trouble. she's in very big trouble.

37:41.370 --> 37:42.970
Mrs. zlatavich.

37:43.530 --> 37:44.920
We know...

37:45.270 --> 37:47.330
We know you killed this man.

37:48.070 --> 37:50.459
Your daughter is in jail now.

37:50.460 --> 37:52.739
Leyla is protecting you.

37:52.740 --> 37:55.659
You came here on her birthday, didn't you?

37:55.660 --> 37:57.660
To surprise her.

38:00.320 --> 38:03.000
Y-y-you were giving her a gift.

38:03.110 --> 38:04.010
A bracelet.

38:04.020 --> 38:06.689
Yeah, yeah. you landed at the airport.

38:06.690 --> 38:08.149
And you got into a taxi,

38:08.150 --> 38:10.079
But you had the wrong address.

38:10.080 --> 38:11.610
Look.

38:11.620 --> 38:12.810
Algonquin avenue, right?

38:12.820 --> 38:15.039
That was her old address.

38:15.040 --> 38:17.300
You didn't know she had moved.

39:09.450 --> 39:11.089
Would you like to see your daughter?

39:11.090 --> 39:13.090
Would you like to see Leyla?

39:22.160 --> 39:24.329
Look it up. it's okay.

39:24.330 --> 39:26.250
I know what she said.

39:36.580 --> 39:37.970
How'd you know?

39:38.310 --> 39:40.490
I didn't know.

39:40.840 --> 39:42.390
I was hoping.

39:42.980 --> 39:45.560
Just glad it all worked out.

39:46.020 --> 39:48.600
Yeah. lucky thing.

40:03.620 --> 40:04.700
Leyla.

40:04.790 --> 40:06.310
How's she doing?

40:06.670 --> 40:08.980
It should be me in there.

40:09.490 --> 40:10.609
You know I wanted to go.

40:10.610 --> 40:11.119
I know.

40:11.120 --> 40:13.269
I know. the d.a. just called.

40:13.270 --> 40:15.509
Everybody underStands what happened.

40:15.510 --> 40:17.429
Why she did what she did.

40:17.430 --> 40:19.109
She'll be out in two years.

40:19.110 --> 40:21.489
Probably less with good behavior.

40:21.490 --> 40:23.479
Two years? I'm sure it'll be less.

40:23.480 --> 40:26.819
She seems like a very well-behaved older woman.

40:26.820 --> 40:28.879
I only met her the one time, but--

40:28.880 --> 40:31.920
Why did you do it? why did you bring her in?

40:34.230 --> 40:35.860
Because...

40:36.640 --> 40:38.480
Because she did it.

40:40.310 --> 40:43.430
My mother is going to jail.

40:44.650 --> 40:45.949
Okay, let's--

40:45.950 --> 40:48.600
Let's go somewhere and talk about it.

40:48.850 --> 40:51.210
No. not now.

40:51.690 --> 40:54.300
Go back to your wife, Detective monk.

40:56.620 --> 41:00.760
Did you--did you just say "wife" or "life"?

41:01.110 --> 41:03.110
Both.
