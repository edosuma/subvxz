WEBVTT

00:01.044 --> 00:02.306
PREVIOUSLY ON "THE 100"...

00:02.350 --> 00:03.742
OCTAVIA: THIS IS HOW
IT WAS MEANT TO BE,

00:03.786 --> 00:05.005
YOU AND ME FIGHTING
SIDE BY SIDE.

00:05.048 --> 00:06.745
-MOMMY, PLEASE HELP!

00:06.789 --> 00:07.616
-HOPE.

00:07.659 --> 00:08.660
HELP!

00:08.704 --> 00:10.053
JORDAN?

00:10.097 --> 00:11.272
ACCORDING TO OUR
ADJUSTMENT PROTOCOL,

00:11.315 --> 00:14.231
NONBELIEVERS
MUST BE PURIFIED.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.146
BELLAMY: WEAPONS DOWN.
WE DON'T WANT TO KILL
THEM, OK?

00:16.190 --> 00:17.669
THEY WANT TO
KILL US.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.934
WELCOME BACK
DANIEL PRIME
AND KAYLEE PRIME.

00:21.978 --> 00:23.936
BETRAYING YOUR FRIENDS
IS NOT THE ANSWER.

00:23.980 --> 00:26.200
YOU'VE ONLY RESURRECTED
5 PRIMES.

00:26.243 --> 00:27.853
WE HAVE ALL
THE HOSTS WE NEED.

00:27.897 --> 00:29.377
I'M SORRY IT HAS TO
BE THIS WAY, ABBY.

00:29.420 --> 00:31.074
-DON'T DO THIS!
-NO. LEAVE HER ALONE!

00:31.118 --> 00:33.207
-NOOOO!
-NO!

00:37.037 --> 00:38.864
-MOM?
-OH, SWEETHEART.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.170
WE'RE GONNA SAVE
OUR PEOPLE.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.998
I'M PROUD OF YOU,
MURPHY.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.347
JOSEPHINE CALLED
ME JOHN.

00:43.391 --> 00:44.914
RUSSELL: THROW HER
TO THE WOLVES.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.047
NO. I SAW HER
IN CLARKE'S MIND.

00:47.090 --> 00:48.961
WE NEED HER TO GET
ON THAT SHIP.

00:54.358 --> 00:57.274
NIYLAH: CLARKE, ABBY,
WHAT RE YOU DOING?

00:57.318 --> 00:59.711
THAT'S NOT
CLARKE AND ABBY.

00:59.755 --> 01:02.497
CLARKE: VERY GOOD.
SEEMS WE GOT
OUR NIGHTBLOOD

01:02.540 --> 01:06.109
DESPITE WHAT I'M
TOLD YOU DID
WITH KANE.

01:06.153 --> 01:08.720
NOW YOU HAVE
3 SECONDS TO
STAND DOWN.

01:08.764 --> 01:11.549
OR WHAT?
IF YOU KILL THEM,

01:11.593 --> 01:13.769
WE KILL YOU.

01:13.812 --> 01:15.814
YOU DIDN'T THINK
THIS THROUGH.

01:15.858 --> 01:18.948
CLARKE: 1...

01:18.991 --> 01:20.689
2...

01:20.732 --> 01:23.692
WEAPONS DOWN NOW.

01:27.609 --> 01:29.045
TOLD YOU.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.916
CLARKE'S MEMORIES
MAY SUCK,

01:30.960 --> 01:32.527
BUT THEY DO COME
IN HANDY.

01:36.008 --> 01:38.010
GUARD: MOVE. MOVE.

01:38.054 --> 01:39.229
INDRA, WHAT IS THIS?

01:39.273 --> 01:41.057
INDRA: JUST SAY CALM.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.373
HEY!

01:52.416 --> 01:54.026
SIMONE: HOW MANY MORE
OF YOU ARE AWAKE?

01:54.070 --> 01:55.854
-NONE.
-ARE YOU SURE?

01:55.898 --> 01:57.595
WE'LL SWEEP THE SHIP.

01:57.639 --> 01:59.423
ANYONE WE FIND DIES,

01:59.467 --> 02:02.209
AND FOR EACH OF THEM,
SO DOES ONE OF YOU.

02:02.252 --> 02:03.775
CARE TO AMEND
YOUR ANSWER?

02:03.819 --> 02:05.951
NO.

02:05.995 --> 02:08.258
OK. YOU'RE
THEIR LEADER,

02:08.302 --> 02:10.042
SO HERE'S
THE SITUATION.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.262
WE'RE SETTING SAIL
FOR PLANET BETA.

02:12.306 --> 02:14.699
IT'S A 20-YEAR JOURNEY.

02:16.397 --> 02:18.486
YOU CAN TAKE IT
WITH US PEACEFULLY
IN CRYO...

02:18.529 --> 02:20.096
SAVE MADI.
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF THE REST.

02:20.140 --> 02:22.446
RUSSELL: OR YOU
CAN DIE TODAY.

02:22.490 --> 02:24.492
WE'LL GIVE YOU
AN HOUR TO DECIDE.

02:33.370 --> 02:34.676
AAH!

02:47.993 --> 02:51.562
NO ONE GIVES
ORDERS HERE BUT US.

02:51.606 --> 02:53.173
UGH!

03:00.049 --> 03:02.225
UCH.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.053
LET THEM ROT.

03:04.096 --> 03:07.665
COME ON. WE HAVE
THINGS TO DISCUSS.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.189
RUSSELL: LOCK IT UP.

03:11.930 --> 03:13.367
GUARD: STAY BACK.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.199
RAVEN.

03:20.548 --> 03:22.114
FINALLY.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.815
THERE'S A COMPUTER
UPSTAIRS IN MED BAY.

03:26.858 --> 03:29.513
FOLLOW ME.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.994
INDRA: GAIA...

03:32.037 --> 03:34.083
EXPLAIN.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.954
RUSSELL: DEVOTION
LIKE THAT IS DANGEROUS.

03:35.998 --> 03:38.174
THEY OBEYED HER
EVEN THOUGH THEY
KNEW THEY WOULD DIE.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.220
JUST WAIT. PLANET BETA--

03:40.263 --> 03:41.917
RUSSELL, WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW IF IT'S SURVIVABLE.

03:41.960 --> 03:44.224
IF IT ISN'T,
WE GO FOR GAMMA,

03:44.267 --> 03:45.964
THEN DELTA,
THEN EPSILON.

03:46.008 --> 03:48.358
WE WON'T EVEN HAVE TO
LAND TO FIND OUT
IF IT'S SURVIVABLE.

03:48.402 --> 03:51.056
ASSUMING
THERE ARE NO OTHER
SIGNAL-SUCKING ANOMALIES,

03:51.100 --> 03:52.623
WE CAN ACCESS
THE MIND DRIVES

03:52.667 --> 03:56.497
OF THE OTHER TEAMS
WIRELESSLY FROM UP HERE.

03:56.540 --> 04:03.199
COME ON. WE WERE
EXPLORERS ONCE,
WEREN'T WE?

04:03.243 --> 04:04.635
RUSSELL, I LOVE YOU,

04:04.679 --> 04:06.855
AND I WILL GO WITH YOU
ACROSS THE STARS AND BACK,

04:06.898 --> 04:08.073
BUT YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:08.117 --> 04:10.685
THAT CHILD IS A PROBLEM.

04:10.728 --> 04:14.123
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE,
SHE HAS THE BLOOD.

04:14.166 --> 04:16.908
IN FACT, DIBS ON HER
AS MY NEXT HOST.

04:16.952 --> 04:18.388
SIMONE, IF WE KILL
THEIR LEADER,

04:18.432 --> 04:20.085
THEY WILL NEVER
FOLLOW US,

04:20.129 --> 04:21.739
AND WE NEED THOSE
PEOPLE TO SERVE US

04:21.783 --> 04:25.613
UNLESS YOU PLAN
ON CLEANING LATRINES.

04:25.656 --> 04:29.747
FINE. THEN WE KILL
HER SLEEPING ARMY

04:29.791 --> 04:32.707
BECAUSE I PROMISE YOU
THEY ARE ALREADY TALKING

04:32.750 --> 04:34.404
ABOUT HOW TO WAKE THEM.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.276
WE BROUGHT ENOUGH
MIND-WIPING FLUID

04:36.319 --> 04:38.408
TO ERASE THEM ALL
IN THEIR SLEEP,

04:38.452 --> 04:40.018
WHERE THEY'LL BE
PERFECTLY PRESERVED

04:40.062 --> 04:41.803
UNTIL ONE OF US NEEDS
A NEW HOST.

04:44.588 --> 04:46.938
MIRANDA: WE'LL
NEVER EVEN HAVE
TO KNOW THEM.

04:51.465 --> 04:55.556
FINE, BUT THEN IT'S
ON TO BETA. AGREED?

04:58.907 --> 05:02.606
JOSIE, WHAT SAY YOU?

05:02.650 --> 05:06.131
HEH. ARE YOU KIDDING?
IT'S BRILLIANT.

05:06.175 --> 05:08.308
A LITTLE GENOCIDE,
A LONG NAP.

05:08.351 --> 05:12.355
WHAT THE HELL?
LET'S BE EXPLORERS.

05:56.399 --> 05:58.009
BELLAMY: HOW MUCH LONGER
WILL THIS LAST?

06:01.230 --> 06:03.319
IT'LL LAST LONGER
THAN THESE WALLS WILL.

06:03.363 --> 06:04.973
NELSON: OK.
WE MOVE TOGETHER,

06:05.016 --> 06:06.496
FIRING
ALL DIRECTIONS.

06:06.540 --> 06:08.411
ONCE WE GET TO THE STAIRS,
WE HAUL ASS TO THE WOODS.

06:08.455 --> 06:10.848
NO WAY. WE'RE NOT
LEAVING OUR PEOPLE.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.679
HERE THEY COME.
KNOCK THEM OUT,

06:15.723 --> 06:16.941
WE TIE THEM UP.

06:16.985 --> 06:18.378
TAKE OUT ENOUGH,

06:18.421 --> 06:20.336
EVENTUALLY
THEY'LL STOP.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.040
IS IT OVER?

06:40.269 --> 06:43.446
WOMAN: TODAY,
WE PURIFY SANCTUM.

06:43.490 --> 06:47.232
ADJUSTERS, GO FORTH
AND FIND THE NONBELIEVERS.

06:47.276 --> 06:49.452
BRING THEM HERE.
IF THEY RESIST,

06:49.496 --> 06:52.455
YOU MAY TAKE
THEIR LIVES.

06:52.499 --> 06:57.895
GOOD. YOU'RE ALL AWAKE.

06:57.939 --> 06:59.506
LET'S BEGIN.

07:03.727 --> 07:06.251
DO YOU OR DO YOU NOT
BELIEVE

07:06.295 --> 07:07.731
IN THE DIVINITY
OF THE PRIMES?

07:07.775 --> 07:12.867
YOU DON'T NEED
A POTION TO FIND OUT
MY TRUTH, WITCH.

07:12.910 --> 07:16.392
PRIMES ARE NOT GODS.
THEY ARE LIARS

07:16.436 --> 07:18.873
AND MURDERERS.

07:18.916 --> 07:21.005
NELSON: OHH!

07:25.096 --> 07:27.272
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THIS.

07:27.316 --> 07:29.231
WE'RE NOT YOUR ENEMY.

07:29.274 --> 07:30.972
NO. YOU'RE A DISEASE,

07:31.015 --> 07:33.322
AND THIS IS THE CURE.

07:33.365 --> 07:36.368
YOUR BLOOD OR THE BLOOD
OF SANCTUM.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.035
-GOOD.
-EHH!

08:05.136 --> 08:08.139
VOICES: BLESSED IS DANIEL.
BLESSED IS KAYLEE.

08:12.535 --> 08:15.582
WHAT IS THE MEANING
OF THIS?

08:15.625 --> 08:19.629
WOMAN: BLESSED IS DANIEL.
BLESSED IS KAYLEE.

08:19.673 --> 08:21.326
BLESSED ARE THE PRIMES.

08:21.370 --> 08:23.459
RISE...

08:23.503 --> 08:26.810
AND EXPLAIN
YOURSELF.

08:26.854 --> 08:31.336
WOMAN: WE ARE PURIFYING
SANCTUM, HOLINESS,

08:31.380 --> 08:34.122
AS SO ORDERED
BY RUSSELL PRIME,

08:34.165 --> 08:36.298
HALLOWED BE HIS NAME.

08:36.341 --> 08:37.647
OTHERS: HALLOWED
BE HIS NAME.

08:37.691 --> 08:40.345
RUSSELL IS NOT HERE.

08:40.389 --> 08:45.394
HE ABANDONED YOU!
WE DID NOT.

08:45.437 --> 08:48.571
EMORI: ADJUSTMENTS ARE
FOR OUR FLOCK.

08:48.615 --> 08:50.747
WHY ARE THE EARTH
PEOPLE HERE?

08:50.791 --> 08:53.184
YOU KNOW WHAT?
NEVER MIND.

08:53.228 --> 08:56.536
IT'S ALL RIGHT,

08:56.579 --> 08:59.190
BUT WE SHALL DECIDE
WHAT DO WITH THEM.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.935
LET'S TAKE THEM
TO THE PALACE.

09:06.110 --> 09:08.373
HELP THEM
TO THEIR FEET.

09:08.417 --> 09:09.723
WOMAN: YOU HEARD HER.
MAN: LET'S GO.

09:09.766 --> 09:10.985
WOMAN: GET THEM
ON THEIR FEET.

09:11.028 --> 09:12.595
MAN: WE'LL ESCORT
YOUR HOLINESSES.

09:12.639 --> 09:14.379
MURPHY: THAT WON'T
BE NECESSARY.

09:14.423 --> 09:15.946
YOU'VE GOT IMPORTANT
WORK TO DO.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.514
WOMAN: NOT HIM.
THE CHILD OF GABRIEL STAYS.

09:21.735 --> 09:25.565
THANK THE PRIMES.
I MISSED YOU.

09:31.266 --> 09:35.183
THAT WAS...
INTERESTING.

09:35.226 --> 09:37.054
ANOTHER TIME
PERHAPS.

09:44.845 --> 09:46.194
UNH!

09:50.590 --> 09:52.113
HE DIDN'T
REMEMBER ME.

09:54.768 --> 09:58.249
WELL, WHO'S
THE HERO NOW?

09:58.293 --> 10:00.600
MURPHY: COME ON.
BELLAMY: WHERE'S EVERYONE ELSE?

10:00.643 --> 10:03.037
SPACE. THERE'S ONLY
JORDAN HERE NOW.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.821
HE'S OUR NEXT STOP.

10:04.865 --> 10:06.780
MURPHY: JUST KEEP
YOUR EYES DOWN
AND MOVE CALMLY.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.433
THESE PEOPLE ARE
STILL WHACKED OUT
OF THEIR MINDS.

10:08.477 --> 10:09.913
ECHO: WHY DO THEY
THINK YOU'RE PRIMES?

10:09.957 --> 10:12.612
MILLER: UH, GUYS.
BELLAMY: IT'S THE TOXIN.

10:12.655 --> 10:13.917
EMORI: WE JUST HAVE TO
GET HIM TO THE PALACE.

10:13.961 --> 10:15.615
GABRIEL'S WAITING.
HE'LL KNOW WHAT TO DO.

10:15.658 --> 10:17.921
WOMAN: THE EARTH PEOPLE!
IT'S THEIR FAULT

10:17.965 --> 10:20.097
RUSSELL LEFT US!

10:20.141 --> 10:21.359
KILL THEM!

10:22.796 --> 10:24.754
OCTAVIA: RUN! RUN
GET TO THE PALACE!

10:24.798 --> 10:26.974
WOMAN: KILL THEM!
KILL THEM!

10:31.456 --> 10:33.937
MURPHY: GABRIEL,
OPEN THE DOOR!

10:43.338 --> 10:45.383
GO, GO, GO, GO!

10:45.427 --> 10:46.471
MY PEOPLE?

10:46.515 --> 10:48.169
WE GOT WHO WE COULD.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.520
GABRIEL: GET INSIDE.
LET'S GO.

11:11.148 --> 11:12.541
HEH.

11:12.584 --> 11:14.586
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS,

11:14.630 --> 11:19.766
BUT...ARE WE SURE?

11:19.809 --> 11:23.726
I MEAN, IT IS THE REST
OF THE HUMAN RACE AFTER ALL.

11:23.770 --> 11:26.250
SIMONE: YOU SOUND
LIKE YOUR FATHER.

11:26.294 --> 11:30.515
WELL, IT'S BIGGER
THAN THE TANK
ON ELIGIUS 3,

11:30.559 --> 11:33.823
BUT THIS IS
WHERE IT GOES.

11:33.867 --> 11:38.741
-HAND ME THE SERUM.
-JUST WAIT.

11:38.785 --> 11:41.831
ARE YOU FEELING OK?
YOU LOOK PALE.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.051
HAVE YOU HAD ANY
NOSEBLEEDS

11:44.094 --> 11:47.707
OR MEMORY FLASHES
THAT AREN'T FAMILIAR?

11:47.750 --> 11:51.275
NO. WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

11:51.319 --> 11:54.365
OH, IT'S SOMETHING I SAW
IN CLARKE'S MINDSPACE.

11:54.409 --> 11:57.629
HER MOTHER HAD THE SAME
NEUROMESH AS SHE DID.

11:57.673 --> 11:59.501
I THOUGHT THEY DESTROYED
IT WITH AN EMP, BUT--

11:59.544 --> 12:02.809
RUSSELL: THEY DID.
I EXAMINED HER
BEFORE RESURRECTION.

12:02.852 --> 12:05.637
I WASN'T ABOUT TO
MAKE THE SAME
MISTAKE TWICE.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.555
JOSEPHINE...

12:10.599 --> 12:12.253
GIVE IT TO ME.

12:22.219 --> 12:23.917
NO.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.881
RUSSELL: NO.
NOT JOSIE.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.929
I CAN'T LET YOU
KILL THESE PEOPLE.

12:37.365 --> 12:41.673
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
I AM SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.288
DARLING, LISTEN TO ME.

12:47.331 --> 12:50.595
I'LL GET THE OTHERS
AND TRACK CLARKE'S
MIND DRIVE.

12:50.639 --> 12:51.771
YOU GET THE CHILD.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.947
WE ARE GONNA USE
HER AS LEVERAGE.

13:05.306 --> 13:08.788
JAMES: ALL RIGHT.
SECOND HARD DRIVE'S
JACKED IN.

13:08.831 --> 13:11.660
WHOA. WHERE'D YOU LEARN
TO CODE LIKE THAT?

13:11.703 --> 13:13.531
CITY OF LIGHT
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.185
RAVEN, FOCUS, PLEASE.

13:18.145 --> 13:22.062
INDRA: I SAW
HIM ONCE--SHEIDHEDA.

13:22.105 --> 13:25.195
I WAS ONLY A GIRL
WHEN HE TOOK TRIKRU.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.241
HE WENT FROM VILLAGE
TO VILLAGE,

13:27.284 --> 13:30.548
BUTCHERING ANYONE
WHO REFUSED TO KNEEL,

13:30.592 --> 13:33.334
THEIR FAMILIES, TOO.

13:33.377 --> 13:36.728
WE CANNOT LET
THIS CREATURE
COMMAND WONKRU.

13:36.772 --> 13:39.122
I KNOW, MOTHER.

13:39.166 --> 13:43.866
IF WE FAIL,
I'LL TAKE HER LIFE.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.650
RAVEN: THEN HOW ABOUT
WE DON'T FAIL?

13:45.694 --> 13:47.043
THANKS TO BECCA'S BOOK,

13:47.087 --> 13:48.958
WE'RE PAST
THE A.I.'S SECURITY.

13:49.002 --> 13:51.178
IF I'M RIGHT AND IT
QUARANTINED THE MINDS

13:51.221 --> 13:53.049
OF THE OTHER COMMANDERS,
IT SHOULD BE EASY

13:53.093 --> 13:55.747
TO ISOLATE SHEIDHEDA
AND DUMP IT ONTO
THE SECOND COMPUTER.

13:55.791 --> 13:58.185
IN THERE, WE KILL
THE SON OF A BITCH.

14:00.840 --> 14:03.973
GAIA: WHAT IS IT?
WHAT'S WRONG?

14:04.017 --> 14:06.976
IT LOOKS LIKE
THERE'S A KILL CODE,

14:07.020 --> 14:09.500
BUT BECCA DOESN'T
MENTION THAT
IN HER NOTES.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.546
SO CAN YOU KILL IT
OR NOT?

14:11.589 --> 14:13.983
I CAN, BUT...

14:14.027 --> 14:15.985
IT'LL DESTROY
THE FLAME.

14:18.596 --> 14:20.381
HE'S MAKING US CHOOSE.

14:25.038 --> 14:27.214
GUYS, SHE'S WAKING UP.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.655
ERR! UGH!

14:33.698 --> 14:35.700
RELEASE ME! UGH!

14:35.744 --> 14:37.615
RAVEN: GAIA, WHAT
DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

14:46.407 --> 14:48.583
KILL THE SON OF A BITCH.

14:48.626 --> 14:50.063
WITH PLEASURE.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.197
I WILL KILL YOU, SEDA!

14:55.590 --> 14:57.505
I WILL KILL YOU ALL!

14:57.548 --> 14:58.985
AAH! UNH!

14:59.028 --> 15:00.595
NO MORE KNEELING.

15:00.638 --> 15:01.988
YOU WILL ALL BURN!

15:02.031 --> 15:06.775
MAN: OUT OF THE WAY!
RUSSELL: WHERE'S THE CHILD?

15:06.818 --> 15:07.950
RAVEN.

15:07.994 --> 15:09.560
IN THERE!
MOVE, MOVE.

15:09.604 --> 15:11.432
WE'RE
ALMOST THERE.

15:14.957 --> 15:17.307
RUSSELL: IF ANYONE MOVES,
SHOOT THEM, TOO.

15:20.484 --> 15:22.443
THE CHILD COMES
WITH ME.

15:27.622 --> 15:30.581
SHE STOPPED.
WE'RE CLOSE.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.761
MAN: DON'T MOVE!

15:36.805 --> 15:38.285
THAT'S FAR ENOUGH.

15:38.328 --> 15:40.374
I SET THE INNER DOOR
TO STAY OPEN

15:40.417 --> 15:41.636
WHEN I PULL THIS,

15:41.679 --> 15:43.290
SO YOU CAN PUT
THE GUNS DOWN,

15:43.333 --> 15:46.554
OR YOU CAN FLOAT.

15:46.597 --> 15:49.426
YOU HEARD HER.

15:49.470 --> 15:54.127
WEAPONS DOWN NOW.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.519
MOM?

16:00.829 --> 16:04.267
YES. IT'S ME.

16:04.311 --> 16:07.879
MIRANDA: SIMONE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

16:07.923 --> 16:10.970
JASMINE: OK, OK.
WE'RE DOING IT.

16:14.321 --> 16:17.367
CLARKE, I'VE BEEN
PRETENDING, TOO.

16:17.411 --> 16:21.110
NOW LET'S LOCK THEM UP
AND GO SAVE MADI.

16:24.070 --> 16:27.987
DON'T MOVE. KEEP YOUR
HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.163
WHAT'S MY
FATHER'S NAME?

17:39.928 --> 17:42.452
TAKE OFF HER GAG
AND BRING HER CLOSER.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.718
I WANT CLARKE
TO HEAR THIS.

17:47.762 --> 17:50.504
SHEIDHEDA: I TAKE IT THAT MEANS
THE BITCH IS STILL ALIVE.

17:53.507 --> 17:56.118
YOU THINK SHE TOOK
EVERYTHING FROM YOU,

17:56.162 --> 17:58.120
BUT YOU HAVE YOUR LIFE,

17:58.164 --> 18:00.296
YOU HAVE YOUR KINGDOM.

18:00.340 --> 18:03.734
I CAN SAVE BOTH
OF THOSE FOR YOU.

18:03.778 --> 18:07.086
WHAT I WANT IS
REVENGE!

18:07.129 --> 18:09.827
SHE'LL GRIEVE FOR MADI
IF YOU KILL HER.

18:09.871 --> 18:12.134
IT'S TRUE,
BUT SINCE THE CHILD

18:12.178 --> 18:13.396
IS ALREADY GONE,

18:13.440 --> 18:17.139
WHAT ARE YOU REALLY
ACCOMPLISHING?

18:17.183 --> 18:20.011
THE REVENGE I CAN OFFER

18:20.055 --> 18:23.145
WILL BE SO MUCH SWEETER.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.553
WHO THE HELL
ARE YOU?

18:43.818 --> 18:45.124
TREY: YOU'RE THERE NOW.

18:45.167 --> 18:47.822
LET THE BLOOD OF SANCTUM
DO ITS WORK.

18:47.865 --> 18:50.564
FEEL THE RED SUN
ON YOUR FACE.

18:50.607 --> 18:53.044
KNOW THAT THE PRIMES
WILL PROTECT YOU,

18:53.088 --> 18:56.961
THAT PRIYA WILL
PROTECT YOU

18:57.005 --> 18:59.790
BUT ONLY
IF YOU BELIEVE.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.966
JORDAN...

19:02.010 --> 19:04.665
DO YOU BELIEVE
IN THE DIVINITY--

19:08.582 --> 19:10.453
EMORI: HE'S HERE!

19:10.497 --> 19:14.153
MURPHY: THAT'S EVERYONE.
MISSION ACCOMPLISHED.

19:14.196 --> 19:16.851
JORDAN, WE'RE HERE.
YOU'RE SAFE.

19:16.894 --> 19:17.982
GABRIEL: LAY HIM DOWN.

19:18.026 --> 19:19.636
HE'LL BE OUT
FOR HOURS.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.072
BELLAMY: JORDAN?

19:21.116 --> 19:22.987
GABRIEL: HE'S IN
TO DEEP TO RESPOND.

19:23.031 --> 19:25.555
-ADJUSTMENT PROTOCOL?
-UH-HUH.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.124
THE BLOOD OF SANCTUM
IS REAL BLOOD?

19:29.168 --> 19:31.213
GABRIEL: ONLY PARTIALLY.
SIMONE PREDICTED

19:31.257 --> 19:32.867
THAT THE BLOODLETTING
WOULD DEEPEN

19:32.910 --> 19:34.173
THE RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE,

19:34.216 --> 19:35.348
BUT THE PSYCHOACTIVE
COMPONENT IS

19:35.391 --> 19:37.219
IS PURE RED SUN
TOXIN.

19:37.263 --> 19:38.873
BELLAMY: USEFUL STUFF.
GABRIEL: WHEN USED PROPERLY,

19:38.916 --> 19:40.179
IT CAN BE, YEAH.

19:40.222 --> 19:42.181
TREY: HELP!

19:44.705 --> 19:48.012
GABRIEL: LOOKS LIKE
WE FOUND THE ADJUSTER.

19:48.056 --> 19:49.971
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.494
WE TOLD THEM
THE TRUTH.

19:51.538 --> 19:53.366
WHY ARE THEY
STILL DOING THIS?

19:53.409 --> 19:55.368
OCTAVIA: IF THEY ACCEPT
THE TRUTH,

19:55.411 --> 19:58.327
THEIR LIVES MEAN NOTHING.

19:58.371 --> 20:01.852
IT'S WHY I BURNT
THE FARM.

20:01.896 --> 20:03.506
HELP ME TIE HIM UP.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.991
GABRIEL: WE CAN USE THAT TO SAVE
THE PEOPLE IN THE TAVERN.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.298
COGNITIVE DISSONANCE.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.038
THEY'LL BELIEVE ANYTHING
IF IT REINFORCES

20:14.082 --> 20:16.345
WHAT THEY WANT
TO BE TRUE,

20:16.389 --> 20:19.870
EVEN THAT YOU'RE
STILL DANIEL LEE.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.571
ANTITOXIN AGAIN?
WHY?

20:24.614 --> 20:26.268
THE BLOOD OF SANCTUM
IS FOR MORE POTENT

20:26.312 --> 20:28.357
THAN WHAT WAS
IN RUSSELL'S BOMB.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.576
YOU TAKE ME IN
AS A PRISONER.

20:29.619 --> 20:31.230
THEN ONCE WE'RE
INSIDE THE TAVERN--

20:31.273 --> 20:32.405
WHAT? NO, NO, NO, NO.
SLOW DOWN.

20:32.448 --> 20:33.536
NO WAY AM I
DRINKING THAT STUFF.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.277
THEY'RE KILLING
NONBELIEVERS.

20:35.321 --> 20:37.497
MY FRIEND WHO YOU LEFT
BEHIND IS ONE OF THEM.

20:40.761 --> 20:43.546
LOOK. I AM SORRY,
BUT WE STAYED
TO SAVE OUR FRIENDS,

20:43.590 --> 20:45.853
AND WE DID THAT.

20:45.896 --> 20:47.637
WE'RE ALL HERE.

20:47.681 --> 20:51.119
IF I COULD HELP
OUR PEOPLE IN SPACE,
I WOULD,

20:51.162 --> 20:53.164
BUT THIS ISN'T
OUR FIGHT.

21:01.782 --> 21:03.262
OK.

21:04.611 --> 21:06.177
WAIT FOR ME.

21:09.659 --> 21:12.183
I CAN'T LET
THESE PEOPLE DIE, BELL.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.665
SIDE BY SIDE.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.843
LIKE IT WAS
MEANT TO BE.

21:32.116 --> 21:36.207
I GUESS IT'S TIME
TO DO BETTER.

21:36.251 --> 21:38.427
KAYLEE PRIME
AT YOUR SERVICE.

21:38.471 --> 21:42.257
-EMORI.
-JOHN, IT'S OK.

21:42.301 --> 21:45.173
SOMEONE NEEDS TO
STAY BEHIND AND LOOK
AFTER MILLER AND JORDAN.

21:45.216 --> 21:46.827
GABRIEL:
EXCUSE ME. SORRY.

21:46.870 --> 21:49.046
KAYLEE WAS AGAINST
THE ADJUSTMENT PROTOCOL.

21:49.090 --> 21:53.050
IT'S WHY THEY BELIEVED IT
WHEN YOU TOOK THEM ALL AWAY.

21:53.094 --> 21:54.835
IT HAS TO BE DANIEL.

22:00.667 --> 22:05.976
FINE, BUT IF I DIE,
YOU'RE BRINGING ME BACK.

22:06.020 --> 22:08.457
NO, I'M NOT.

22:08.501 --> 22:10.329
AT LEAST LIE TO ME.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.863
BEING A GOD SHOULD
BE MORE FUN THAN THIS.

22:35.354 --> 22:36.398
INDRA: WE NEED
THAT DOOR OPEN, RAVEN.

22:36.442 --> 22:37.921
RAVEN: WORKING ON IT.

22:37.965 --> 22:41.360
I'M ACTUALLY ANNOYED
AT ELIGIUS' COMPETENCE
RIGHT NOW.

22:44.972 --> 22:46.626
IT WASN'T ME.

22:49.193 --> 22:51.326
CLARKE, HOW--HOW
DID YOU--

22:51.370 --> 22:52.936
SHAW'S FAILSAFE CODE.

22:57.811 --> 23:00.683
WHERE'S MADI?

23:00.727 --> 23:04.470
RUSSELL--
RUSSELL TOOK HER.

23:04.513 --> 23:07.386
OH, NO. OH, NO.
NO, NO.

23:07.429 --> 23:08.648
WE'LL GET HER BACK.

23:08.691 --> 23:12.956
NO. YOU DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.220
I KILLED HIS FAMILY,

23:16.264 --> 23:19.223
AND NOW HE'S
GONNA KILL MINE.

23:19.267 --> 23:21.008
I WON'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

23:33.324 --> 23:35.457
INDRA: THE DEMON
AWOKE WONKRU.

23:54.302 --> 23:58.175
LEXA FROM TRIKRU
SAID YOU WERE STRONG,

23:58.219 --> 24:02.484
BUT YOU'RE AS WEAK
AS HER.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.921
YOUR LOVE
HAS MADE YOU SO.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.234
MAN: GUN!

24:13.277 --> 24:14.931
RUSSELL: HOLD.

24:14.975 --> 24:16.498
CLARKE: MADI.

24:16.542 --> 24:19.458
MADI, I KNOW
YOU'RE IN THERE.

24:19.501 --> 24:23.287
PLEASE COME BACK TO ME.

24:23.331 --> 24:25.638
I LOST MY MOTHER TODAY.

24:29.293 --> 24:33.472
I CAN'T LOSE YOU, TOO.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.386
OH, PLEASE.

24:39.347 --> 24:41.001
I'M GONNA PULL
THE TRIGGER...

24:42.481 --> 24:45.309
IN 3...

24:45.353 --> 24:48.965
2...

24:54.275 --> 24:55.885
MAN: WEAPONS DOWN!

25:13.947 --> 25:16.340
RAWWW!

25:17.690 --> 25:18.778
-MADI?
-SHE'S SEIZING.

25:18.821 --> 25:20.040
RAVEN: GET HER
UPSTAIRS!

25:20.083 --> 25:21.520
-MADI?
-HURRY!

25:32.966 --> 25:34.837
RAWWW!

25:37.231 --> 25:38.972
HOLD HER STEADY.

25:41.583 --> 25:43.846
MADI, MADI, I'M HERE.

25:43.890 --> 25:48.416
LISTEN TO MY VOICE.
YOU CAN DO THIS.

25:48.459 --> 25:50.026
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT,
MADI.

25:50.070 --> 25:51.985
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT!

25:55.118 --> 25:56.859
ONCE MORE WITH FEELING.

26:05.912 --> 26:07.522
RAVEN: GOT HIM!

26:22.581 --> 26:24.757
NIYLAH: WHY ISN'T SHE
WAKING UP?

26:27.281 --> 26:28.587
HER PULSE
IS TOO WEAK.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.850
NO, NO, NO, NO.

26:30.893 --> 26:33.635
WAIT. I KNOW
WHAT THIS IS.

26:33.679 --> 26:34.897
WE HAVE TO TAKE
IT OUT

26:34.941 --> 26:38.292
LIKE YOU DID WITH ME
AFTER THE EMP.

26:38.335 --> 26:39.902
I NEED A BLADE.

27:03.056 --> 27:04.535
FORCEPS.

27:30.518 --> 27:32.128
I'LL CLOSE.

27:33.521 --> 27:37.046
CLARKE: I'M HERE.
YOU'RE OK.

27:39.962 --> 27:42.661
I'M NOT THE COMMANDER
ANYMORE.

27:49.493 --> 27:51.539
THANK YOU.

27:55.369 --> 27:59.547
I'M SORRY
ABOUT ABBY.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.288
INDRA: RAVEN.

28:10.166 --> 28:11.864
WHERE DID HE GO?

28:19.567 --> 28:21.874
MURPHY: LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

28:21.917 --> 28:24.964
WELCOME TO THE MAIN
EVENT OF THE EVENING,

28:25.007 --> 28:29.185
AN ADJUSTMENT
FOR THE DEMON
GABRIEL HIMSELF.

28:34.234 --> 28:35.888
MURPHY: EASY, BIG BOY.

28:39.674 --> 28:41.720
GOT ROOM FOR ONE MORE?

28:43.373 --> 28:45.245
RIGHT THIS WAY,
HOLINESS.

28:55.908 --> 28:58.388
ECHO: AS SOON AS
SOMEONE ELSE KNOCKS
ON THAT DOOR,

28:58.432 --> 28:59.738
THEY'LL KNOW WE TOOK
THE TAVERN.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.087
THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN.

29:01.130 --> 29:02.871
GABRIEL AND MURPHY
CONTROL THE INSIDE.

29:02.915 --> 29:04.960
WE MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE
GETS INSIDE.

29:05.004 --> 29:10.226
IF THAT HAPPENS,
IT'LL BE 30 ON 3.

29:10.270 --> 29:11.837
I LIKE
OUR CHANCES.

29:19.061 --> 29:20.671
ADJUSTER: THE FOREST IS AWAKE.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.717
THE VINES PIERCE
YOUR SKIN.

29:22.761 --> 29:25.459
THE SWARM IS DEVOURING YOU.

29:25.502 --> 29:26.852
DO YOU FEEL IT?

29:26.895 --> 29:29.898
THE PRIMES WILL SAVE YOU
IF YOU LET THEM.

29:29.942 --> 29:32.771
WOMAN: ZEV, WE HAVE
A SPECIAL GUEST.

29:40.474 --> 29:42.432
IS SOMETHING WRONG,
YOUR GRACE?

29:42.476 --> 29:45.087
NO. LET'S GET THIS
OVER WITH.

29:45.131 --> 29:48.743
DOSE US BOTH.
I NEED ADJUSTING, TOO.

29:54.053 --> 29:56.620
SOMETHING WENT WRONG
WITH MY RESURRECTION.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.884
MY MEMORY IS SHOT.

30:06.674 --> 30:08.807
FOR THE GLORY
AND GRACE OF ME.

30:25.780 --> 30:27.956
I'M SORRY THIS
HAPPENED TO YOU.

30:31.264 --> 30:34.093
YOUR BLOOD
OR THE BLOOD OF SANCTUM.

30:57.943 --> 31:00.989
WE PURIFY SANCTUM
THROUGH FIRE!

31:01.033 --> 31:04.036
GET THE FUEL!
SOAK IT DOWN!

31:08.214 --> 31:11.695
TOGETHER, WE SEND
THE DEMON

31:11.739 --> 31:15.264
AND HIS FALSE PROPHET
TO HELL!

31:15.308 --> 31:20.139
BELLAMY: LEAVE THE TORCH
AND BACK AWAY.

31:20.182 --> 31:22.489
THOSE ARE YOUR PEOPLE
IN THERE.

31:22.532 --> 31:23.794
HELP US SAVE THEM.

31:23.838 --> 31:25.796
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.799
THEIR SACRIFICE
WILL BE A BLESSING
TO US ALL.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.889
ECHO: CAN'T LET YOU
DO THAT.

31:44.990 --> 31:47.949
THE TOXIN IS QUICK
IN THIS HOST.

31:57.654 --> 31:59.221
I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS.

31:59.265 --> 32:01.571
YOU REALLY DO SEEM LIKE
A NICE GUY.

32:01.615 --> 32:03.095
GOOD KISSER, TOO.

32:03.138 --> 32:05.053
OCTAVIA: I GOT THESE GUYS!
GO FOR THE TORCHES!

32:05.097 --> 32:07.534
KEEP THEM AWAY
FROM THE TAVERN!

32:42.482 --> 32:43.744
TOOK YOUR TIME.

32:43.787 --> 32:45.267
MY GUY WAS TOUGHER.

33:20.128 --> 33:23.523
FOR THE GLORY
AND THE GRACE

33:23.566 --> 33:25.394
OF THE PRIMES!

33:28.267 --> 33:30.051
AAH!

33:54.510 --> 33:56.643
BELLAMY: ECHO,
CHECK ON THE OTHERS.

33:58.253 --> 33:59.994
YOU OK?

34:04.085 --> 34:05.869
EVERYTHING OK
IN THERE?

34:05.913 --> 34:07.610
MURPHY: YEAH.
BEST PARTY EVER.

34:13.790 --> 34:15.575
SHOW-OFF.

34:17.142 --> 34:19.057
COUNTED AT LEAST
A DOZEN RUNNERS.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.580
WATCH ALL SIDES
OF THE TAVERN

34:20.623 --> 34:21.885
IN CASE THEY
COME BACK.

34:23.757 --> 34:25.411
AGH!

34:28.849 --> 34:30.720
WHEN DID YOU
GET THAT?

34:30.764 --> 34:33.375
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?

34:33.419 --> 34:34.942
MAY I?

34:43.124 --> 34:44.995
HAVE YOU SEEN
THAT BEFORE?

34:45.039 --> 34:48.086
GABRIEL: THE TATTOO? NO.

34:48.129 --> 34:49.652
NO, BUT I'VE BEEN
STUDYING IT

34:49.696 --> 34:51.872
FOR 150 YEARS.

34:51.915 --> 34:53.961
WE CALL IT
THE ANOMALY STONE.

34:54.004 --> 34:57.921
YOU MUST HAVE GOTTEN IT
ON THE OTHER SIDE.

34:57.965 --> 35:02.012
HEY. STILL THINK
YOU WERE GONE

35:02.056 --> 35:03.971
FOR ONLY A FEW SECONDS?

35:06.278 --> 35:09.019
IT'S BEAUTIFUL,
BUT WHAT DOES IT MEAN?

35:09.063 --> 35:10.630
GABRIEL: GOOD QUESTION.

35:13.415 --> 35:15.374
IT MEANS I HAVE TO
GO BACK.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.129
BELLAMY: THEY'RE BACK.

35:41.313 --> 35:43.271
DON'T LET THIS
DELAY YOU.

35:43.315 --> 35:46.666
WE'RE STILL LEAVING.

35:46.709 --> 35:49.190

LOOK LIKE YOU HAD
A ROUGH NIGHT.

36:03.030 --> 36:07.252
NOT AS ROUGH AS SOME.

36:07.295 --> 36:10.037
COME ON. THEY'RE
BACK FROM SPACE.

36:10.080 --> 36:13.562
I SAW THE SHIP.
YOU GO.

36:13.606 --> 36:15.738

SANCTUM WASN'T PERFECT,

36:39.501 --> 36:42.678

HAD PEACE

36:42.722 --> 36:45.812

37:33.860 --> 37:36.254
I DID,

37:36.297 --> 37:40.823
AND THEN I LOST
MY MOM.

37:40.867 --> 37:43.478
TELL ME IT WAS
WORTH IT.

37:43.522 --> 37:45.480

37:45.524 --> 37:48.091
HEY, HEY. WE DID.
WE DID DO BETTER.

I'M VERY EXCITED
ABOUT THIS.

38:08.155 --> 38:09.809
I'VE BEEN STUDYING
THOSE SYMBOLS

38:09.852 --> 38:12.028
SINCE WE FOUND
THE STONE.

38:12.072 --> 38:14.292
WE BUILT THE CAMP HERE
BECAUSE OF IT.

38:41.144 --> 38:42.537
THE TATTOO.

38:42.581 --> 38:44.496
GABRIEL: IT'S THOUSANDS
TO YEARS OLD.

38:44.539 --> 38:46.541
WE HAVE NO IDEA
WHO MADE IT

38:46.585 --> 38:49.196
OR WHAT GENERATES
THE MAGNETIC FIELD
THAT HOLDS IT UP,

38:49.239 --> 38:51.677
BUT WE'RE PRETTY SURE
IT'S WHAT SUCKS IN
ALL THE RADIO SIGNALS.

38:51.720 --> 38:53.983
ECHO: SOME
OF THE SYMBOLS
ON HER BACK ARE RED.

38:54.027 --> 38:55.376
IT'S A CODE.

38:55.420 --> 38:58.336
VERY GOOD. WE'RE ABOUT
TO FIND OUT WHAT IT'S FOR.

38:58.379 --> 39:00.512
MAY I SEE
THE DRAWING, PLEASE?

39:12.741 --> 39:15.048
MOMENT OF TRUTH.

39:25.406 --> 39:27.539
WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU'RE RIGHT?

39:27.582 --> 39:30.672
I FILLED 100 NOTEBOOKS
WITH POSSIBLE ANSWERS
TO THAT QUESTION.

39:33.414 --> 39:35.024
THE LAST SYMBOL
IN THE SERIES

39:35.068 --> 39:37.113
IS CALLED
AN OCTONION.

39:37.157 --> 39:39.202
ADVANCED MATHEMATICS
WAY ABOVE MY HEAD,

39:39.246 --> 39:43.032
BUT I DON'T THINK
IT'S A COINCIDENCE
YOU SHARE A NAME.

39:43.076 --> 39:45.383
PLEASE.
IT SHOULD BE YOU.

40:02.617 --> 40:04.097
GABRIEL:
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

40:04.140 --> 40:06.055
IT CAN 'T BE RIGHT.

40:06.099 --> 40:08.144
LET ME SEE
THE TATTOO AGAIN.

40:08.188 --> 40:09.798
MUST HAVE GOT
SOMETHING WRONG.

40:09.842 --> 40:10.930
QUIET.

40:19.852 --> 40:21.593
OH, MY GOD.

40:23.769 --> 40:25.335
I KNEW IT.

40:36.956 --> 40:40.655
WHAT THE HELL
IS THIS?

40:40.699 --> 40:42.527
SHE'S HERE.

40:47.619 --> 40:49.534
DIYOZA?

40:56.323 --> 40:57.977
HOPE?

40:58.020 --> 40:59.500
I COULDN'T GET
OUT OF IT.

40:59.544 --> 41:02.460
HE HAS MY MOTHER.

41:02.503 --> 41:05.593
I'M SO SORRY,
OCTAVIA.

41:09.510 --> 41:13.253
BELLAMY: OCTAVIA,
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

41:13.296 --> 41:18.388
BE BRAVE.
TELL HIM IT'S DONE.

41:18.432 --> 41:21.653
ECHO: KNIFE!
BELLAMY: NO! NO!

41:25.352 --> 41:27.006
BELLAMY: OCTAVIA!

41:35.449 --> 41:37.495
OCTAVIA!

41:40.367 --> 41:42.543
OCTAVIA!

41:47.853 --> 41:49.855
OCTAVIA!
