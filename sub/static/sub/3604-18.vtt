NARRA TOR:
Previously on Heroes.

00:06.757 --> 00:07.792
Give me one good reason

00:07.884 --> 00:09.215
why I shouldn't tear open
your head right here.

00:09.302 --> 00:10.712
Because you'll
never find your dad.

00:11.888 --> 00:13.094
We need to show progress.

00:13.222 --> 00:14.428
These are our targets.

00:14.515 --> 00:18.053
Hunt them, track them,
and bring them home alive.

00:18.686 --> 00:21.598
If you kill me,
I'll get exactly
what I want.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.099
And what is that?

00:23.274 --> 00:24.730
They'll see what
I've been telling them.

00:24.817 --> 00:27.229
They'll knowjust how
dangerous you people are.

00:28.196 --> 00:29.276
Daphne's alive, Matt!

00:29.363 --> 00:30.978
They have her, alive.
You're lying to me!

00:31.073 --> 00:32.734
No,no,no,no,no.
I won't fight you.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.983
Your mother wants me to move
out of the house for a while.

00:36.078 --> 00:37.454
She's right.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.075
We keep too many
secrets in this family.

00:40.833 --> 00:42.039
They're just
locking people up?

00:42.126 --> 00:43.206
Believe it, it's happening.

00:43.544 --> 00:44.875
Somebody sent me
to warn you.

00:45.004 --> 00:46.369
You must be on
a list or something.

00:46.464 --> 00:47.874
I can breathe underwater.

00:47.965 --> 00:50.798
CLAIRE: You’re in danger.
You need to get out
of here immediate/y.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.550
We're all out of
whole wheat. Sorry.

01:01.687 --> 01:03.552
Whatever. l'm starving.

01:03.648 --> 01:04.979
Well, my mom's going
to the market soon,

01:05.107 --> 01:06.438
so hopefully,
she'll take Lyle.

01:06.525 --> 01:09.187
You can come downstairs,
stretch your legs a bit.

01:09.278 --> 01:10.814
Well, that's a good thing.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.569
I'm starting to stink.

01:14.700 --> 01:15.780
Look, I've got the cash.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.859
There's a train leaving
for Albuquerque tonight.

01:17.954 --> 01:19.319
Albuquerque?

01:20.957 --> 01:23.198
I don't know
anyone in Albuquerque.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.407
Well,
that's the point.

01:24.502 --> 01:27.244
You can start over,
become a new person

01:27.713 --> 01:28.964
where no one can find you.

01:29.048 --> 01:31.209
Yeah, but I never
agreed to that.

01:31.300 --> 01:34.042
Okay, my family's here,
my friends, my life.

01:34.136 --> 01:35.751
Look, do you want them
to find you?

01:35.888 --> 01:37.549
Make you disappear forever?

01:37.640 --> 01:39.301
They're gonna
find me anyways.

01:39.392 --> 01:40.928
The government has
those spy satellites.

01:41.018 --> 01:43.009
They're probably
watching us right now.

01:44.522 --> 01:45.637
No.

01:46.607 --> 01:47.767
No, we're fine.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.394
Yeah, but you
don't know that.

01:49.944 --> 01:51.935
Look, you're not Harriet
Tubman, Claire, all right?

01:52.029 --> 01:54.520
And this isn't
the Underground Railroad.

01:54.615 --> 01:55.695
You're just
a high school girl,

01:55.783 --> 01:57.739
and you're in
way over your head.

01:58.744 --> 02:00.280
Well, if it wasn't for
this high school girl,

02:00.371 --> 02:02.362
you might already be dead.

02:02.581 --> 02:03.866
So you want to survive,
you're gonna

02:04.041 --> 02:05.326
have to do
exactly what | tell you.

02:05.418 --> 02:06.703
Got it?

02:07.920 --> 02:09.000
SANDRA: Claire?

02:10.631 --> 02:12.963
I need to speak with you.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.164
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

02:14.719 --> 02:16.175
Claire?

02:17.179 --> 02:18.555
Hey, Mom. What's up?

02:18.639 --> 02:20.800
Our house money is gone.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.807
You know, the money I keep in
Mr. Muggles' rubber sneaker.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.885
Any idea where that went?

02:26.355 --> 02:27.765
Maybe Ly|e took it.

02:27.898 --> 02:29.354
Already grilled him.

02:29.442 --> 02:31.398
Per usual, he has no clue.

02:35.156 --> 02:36.362
Okay, fine, I took it.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.696
l was gonna pay you back.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.193
Claire, I don't get it.

02:39.994 --> 02:41.154
You have a nice allowance.

02:41.245 --> 02:42.781
What do you need $300 for?

02:42.955 --> 02:44.240
Are you in some
kind of trouble?

02:44.373 --> 02:45.658
No, ljust...

02:45.750 --> 02:46.739
(MR. MUGGLES BARKING)

02:47.626 --> 02:49.457
What is it, Muggles?

02:51.213 --> 02:53.955
What's under the bed, boy?
What is it?

02:59.722 --> 03:02.259
What is going on
with you, Claire?

03:02.558 --> 03:04.674
Nothing.
Nothing, I swear.

03:04.769 --> 03:06.179
(BANGING)

03:09.357 --> 03:11.348
I didn't hear anything.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.862
Mrs. Bennet, right?

03:22.953 --> 03:24.079
Hi.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.714
Home, sweet home.

03:38.552 --> 03:39.803
Not anymore.

03:39.887 --> 03:41.627
Got a one-bedroom
in Dupont Circle.

03:43.140 --> 03:44.550
You don't mind that
we're keeping an eye

03:44.642 --> 03:45.882
on your daughter?

03:45.976 --> 03:48.638
Making sure she's
behaving herself?

03:48.729 --> 03:51.220
Claire's a big girl.
She makes her own decisions.

03:51.315 --> 03:52.555
If she does something wrong,

03:52.650 --> 03:54.857
she can live with
the consequences.

03:56.779 --> 03:59.521
Ladies and gentlemen,
your attention please.

04:00.825 --> 04:05.239
Peter Petrelli has joined
Matt Parkman as priority one.

04:05.329 --> 04:07.320
Charged with kidnapping,
assauH

04:07.456 --> 04:09.412
and attempted murder
of federal officers.

04:09.500 --> 04:11.741
Both of these men are
considered armed and dangerous

04:11.836 --> 04:15.420
and should be taken down
by any means necessary.

04:15.506 --> 04:16.837
Short of lethal force.

04:16.966 --> 04:20.174
Actually, Senator,
my men have been
given the go-ahead,

04:20.261 --> 04:21.250
shoot to kill.

04:21.345 --> 04:22.551
On whose authority, Danko?

04:23.431 --> 04:24.591
Mine.

04:27.309 --> 04:28.970
Back to work.

04:29.687 --> 04:31.598
Do you really
want to push my hand?

04:31.689 --> 04:33.350
Your brother came
into my house

04:33.441 --> 04:34.931
and put a gun to my head.

04:35.025 --> 04:36.856
I saved your life,
if I remember.

04:36.986 --> 04:38.476
He made this personal.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.148
I do what I need to do.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.280
Keep an eye on him
for me, will you?

04:47.371 --> 04:50.784
Matt and Peter kidnapped me
and threatened my life.

04:52.042 --> 04:54.954
What makes you think
I won't shoot them myself?

04:55.045 --> 04:57.036
Sir, we have a lead.

04:58.174 --> 04:59.630
Manhattan.

05:08.142 --> 05:10.884
Matt. Matt.

05:10.978 --> 05:12.218
What?

05:13.898 --> 05:16.230
Matt, you need
to stop. Matt.

05:17.902 --> 05:19.688
Matt, you need to stop.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.936
Stop. Stop.
What happened?

05:22.031 --> 05:23.567
Look, you've been
painting the same image

05:23.699 --> 05:25.200
over and over
again all night, okay?

05:25.284 --> 05:26.490
I'm guessing you're
trying to find

05:26.577 --> 05:28.442
some answers
how to stop this.

05:28.537 --> 05:29.652
Oh, God.

05:29.788 --> 05:30.914
Look, we need to
leave,okay?

05:31.040 --> 05:32.325
It's too dangerous here.
We gotta go now.

05:32.458 --> 05:33.743
No!

05:33.876 --> 05:35.161
The only thing
that matters right now

05:35.252 --> 05:37.504
is finding Daphne
and getting her back.

05:37.588 --> 05:39.419
One life at a time.

05:41.759 --> 05:42.919
Okay.

05:43.427 --> 05:44.792
Look, man, what...

05:44.887 --> 05:47.253
When you were in Bennet's
head, could you see,

05:47.389 --> 05:49.175
could you tell
where Daphne was?
Anything?

05:49.266 --> 05:51.052
I don't know. I don't know.

05:51.143 --> 05:53.099
I mean, I didn't see much.
I saw a hallway.

05:53.187 --> 05:54.176
Okay.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.647
(COMPUTER BEEPING)

05:56.774 --> 05:58.184
Did you turn that on?

05:58.317 --> 05:59.773
No.

06:03.239 --> 06:04.445
Who the hell is Rebel?

06:04.615 --> 06:05.821
l have no idea.

06:05.950 --> 06:06.985
Address. Daphne.

06:08.911 --> 06:10.526
Someone's listening
to our conversation.

06:10.663 --> 06:12.278
No,no,no.
He's just hacking in.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.790
This could be information.

06:13.916 --> 06:15.156
We need this information.

06:15.292 --> 06:16.543
No.
We don't know who this is.

06:16.627 --> 06:19.118
How can we trust
this person, huh?

06:23.801 --> 06:26.087
What if this is a setup?

06:27.304 --> 06:30.216
And what if he's
telling the truth?

06:30.307 --> 06:32.468
Go! Go, go, go.

06:44.989 --> 06:46.320
AGENT: They’re gone.

06:50.286 --> 06:52.026
We just missed them.

07:07.344 --> 07:11.758
I think I know
where they're headed.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.692
Mom, this is Alex.

07:33.412 --> 07:34.697
He's...

07:35.998 --> 07:38.034
He's my new boyfriend.

07:38.125 --> 07:39.581
Okay, that doesn't explain

07:39.668 --> 07:41.624
why he's hiding
in your closet.

07:41.712 --> 07:42.952
Right.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.962
Well, we're...

07:48.260 --> 07:50.467
Are you really gonna make me
say it out loud?

07:50.554 --> 07:52.169
Absolutely.

07:54.141 --> 07:58.430
We're having sex,
and I know it's wrong,
very, very wrong.

07:58.520 --> 08:01.057
You do understand
that my daughter
is only 17?

08:01.148 --> 08:03.309
lhavent
touched her,okay?

08:03.400 --> 08:05.436
I barely even
make eye contact.

08:06.028 --> 08:07.313
SANDRA: Claire?

08:08.405 --> 08:09.736
The truth?

08:15.079 --> 08:16.569
He's like me.

08:17.456 --> 08:19.196
He has an ability.

08:20.793 --> 08:22.499
You can tell her.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.959
I can breathe underwater.

08:25.047 --> 08:28.210
He has a power and
you brought him here?

08:28.300 --> 08:29.335
Dad was after him.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.415
I didn't know
what else to do.

08:30.511 --> 08:32.467
Do you have any idea
how dangerous this is?

08:32.554 --> 08:33.509
Yes, I do.

08:33.597 --> 08:34.837
But what was
I supposed to do?
Just let him...

08:34.932 --> 08:37.765
And on top of that,
you lied to me.

08:41.355 --> 08:43.220
I am so disappointed.

08:50.781 --> 08:52.237
SYLAR: The agents still there?

08:52.324 --> 08:55.862
Pretty sure you lost them
when you skidded off
onto the dirt road.

Butjust to be sure.

09:00.082 --> 09:02.573

09:07.589 --> 09:08.999
Well, maybe lam.

09:09.091 --> 09:10.046
I mean, the way I see it,

I just wanted my dad

09:26.608 --> 09:27.563
to take me fishing.

He used my arm as
an ashtray instead.

to get anything.

gonna lock him up.

the same thing to you.

than you think I know.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.683
For example,
I know that right now,

11:26.812 --> 11:29.428
there's a van parked
outside on the street.

11:29.523 --> 11:32.731
They're watching us.
They're watching you.

11:45.789 --> 11:47.370
MAN: You think she's
hiding the Woolsley kid?

11:47.499 --> 11:49.080
Absolutely.

11:49.585 --> 11:52.122
I'm telling you,
she's helping him.

11:54.089 --> 11:57.707
Those pool cleaners
have been parked out
there for four hours.

11:58.302 --> 12:00.463
Nobody's pool is that dirty.

12:00.596 --> 12:02.132
This is bad.

12:02.639 --> 12:04.675
How are you gonna
save Alex, Claire?

12:04.808 --> 12:06.890
You can't go out there.

12:06.977 --> 12:09.218
Are you gonna keep him
up in your closet forever?

12:09.313 --> 12:11.975
No. No, I'll
come up with something.

12:12.816 --> 12:14.397
l have a plan.

12:15.569 --> 12:18.151
| just haven't
thought of it yet.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.145
l have an idea.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.821
You do?
Yeah.

12:23.160 --> 12:27.324
And you can either
keep me in the dark
and lie to protect me,

12:27.789 --> 12:29.074
or you can let me help.

12:29.166 --> 12:31.657
I say we definitely
let her help.

12:35.505 --> 12:38.838
All right, Mom,
what's the plan?

12:39.468 --> 12:40.924
We're not gonna
have a lot of time.

12:41.011 --> 12:43.002
We get in there,
you do your
mind-control magic,

12:43.096 --> 12:45.428
and then we get
Daphne and we're out.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.176
MATT: It's impossible.
I mean, look
at this building.

12:47.309 --> 12:49.015
It's gotta be jam-packed
full of people.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.354
There're only so many
minds that I can control
at any given time.

12:51.480 --> 12:53.846
You know what?
You're right.
You're right.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.432
Hey, what are you doing?
What is that?

12:56.526 --> 12:57.515
| just borrowed your power.

12:57.694 --> 12:58.683
Great.

12:58.820 --> 12:59.980
That way we can
watch each other's backs.

13:00.113 --> 13:01.273
And you can't fly now.

13:01.365 --> 13:03.947
Which basically rules out
our rooftop escape plan.

13:04.034 --> 13:06.616
You see, we gotta get
into the building first.

13:06.703 --> 13:09.866
And two guys pushing thoughts
is better than one.

13:09.957 --> 13:11.447
Come on.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.884
Top floor.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.330
I love doing that.

14:01.425 --> 14:03.711
Right. It makes it
a lot easier.

14:04.428 --> 14:06.089
They got cameras
everywhere. Let's go.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.465
PETER: ln here, come on.

14:14.438 --> 14:15.928
Hey, you're not
allowed in here.

14:16.064 --> 14:17.679
You're gonna finish
your lunch in the hall

14:17.774 --> 14:19.765
and make sure
no one comes in.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.601
I'll just finish
my lunch in the hall.

14:26.116 --> 14:27.902
I thought the plan
was to find Daphne.

14:28.035 --> 14:29.775
Gotta know
where to look, huh?

14:35.083 --> 14:37.119
Sir, take a look at this.

14:38.587 --> 14:40.873
MR. BENNET:
Okay, this is a problem.

14:40.964 --> 14:43.125
How the hell did
they get in here?

14:44.551 --> 14:45.961
The targets are
in Operations.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.550
Shut down the computer
systems. Everything.

14:47.637 --> 14:48.888
Can't. Someone's
hacking in.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.212
Damn it,
just shut it down!

14:50.307 --> 14:52.138
Let's go.
Wait.

14:52.267 --> 14:55.054
To hell with that.
I wouldn't go out there
if I were you.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.760
You're not me.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.483
Son of a bitch.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.924
What?
How'd you do on
your history exam?

15:25.008 --> 15:26.168
C minus.

15:26.301 --> 15:27.416
Right.
You're grounded.

15:27.511 --> 15:30.298
Driver's license,
please. Now.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.431
Thank you.

15:35.519 --> 15:36.474
That was harsh.

15:36.561 --> 15:38.062
He's a terrible
driver anyway.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.096
(SlGHlNG)

15:43.527 --> 15:46.360
SANDRA: To disappear,
you'll need a new identity.

15:46.488 --> 15:50.777
Trick is to
remove the photo

15:50.867 --> 15:52.448
without tearing it.

15:52.536 --> 15:54.197
There.

15:54.871 --> 15:56.657
(SCOFFING) I cannot
believe you know
how to make

15:56.748 --> 15:57.737
a fake ID.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.616
Where did you
learn that? Dad?

16:00.710 --> 16:01.699
No.

16:01.795 --> 16:04.036
Claire, believe it or not,
I was a teenager once.

16:04.172 --> 16:07.790
An enterprising one
not unlike you,
young lady.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.552
There was this band once,
I just had to see.

16:09.636 --> 16:10.967
Def Leppard.

16:11.054 --> 16:15.718
Oh, my God, Rick Savage,
bass player, so cute.

16:16.852 --> 16:17.967
What I would
have given to...

16:18.061 --> 16:19.176
Mom!

16:20.897 --> 16:23.479
Sorry. Alex, you need
to change your looks.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.979
They're probably
using facial
recognition algorithms.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.401
That I learned
from your father.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.820
You can find a change
of clothes upstairs.

16:30.949 --> 16:33.315
I appreciate
everything that
you're doing.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.825
Wow.

16:39.916 --> 16:40.905
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:44.713 --> 16:47.671
You know,
I didn't mean to drag
you into all of this.

16:47.757 --> 16:50.089
You were gonna do it
one way or another, Claire.

16:50.218 --> 16:52.379
Just thought I might help.

16:53.263 --> 16:56.175
I'm sorry for
being the way I am,

16:59.102 --> 17:01.514
making everything
so much harder.

17:01.646 --> 17:04.103
Sometimes,
I just wish I was normal.

17:07.110 --> 17:09.601
Why on Earth
would you want that?

17:09.738 --> 17:12.229
It would just make
everything easier.

17:14.951 --> 17:17.283
Maybe you and Dad
would still be together.

17:17.412 --> 17:21.451
Honey,
your father and I had issues
long before you came around.

17:21.583 --> 17:22.698
Why did you marry him?

17:22.792 --> 17:24.328
'Cause I fell
in love with him,

17:24.878 --> 17:25.867
warts and all.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.498
He was dangerous, handsome...

17:28.256 --> 17:31.043
I accepted everything
that went with that.

17:33.094 --> 17:34.300
But now,

17:37.015 --> 17:39.131
I'm tired of being lied to.

17:40.644 --> 17:43.977
I can't see
my marriage anymore.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.396
So, it's over?

17:47.525 --> 17:49.481
You guys are
gonna get a divorce?

17:50.737 --> 17:52.477
I don't know.

17:52.614 --> 17:53.945
Maybe.

17:54.324 --> 17:58.488
But whatever happens
between your father and l

17:58.620 --> 18:00.781
has nothing to do with you.

18:04.501 --> 18:05.707
Okay?

18:19.975 --> 18:22.307
(WHlSPERlNG) So,
what are we looking for?

18:23.186 --> 18:25.097
Something happened here.

18:25.188 --> 18:26.177
(COUGHING)

18:26.856 --> 18:29.347
Yeah, like
a million years ago.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.318
I've been here before.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.147
How do you know?

18:49.504 --> 18:51.040
I remember.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.711
My father was here, too.

19:46.144 --> 19:48.135
Where did you just go?

19:50.940 --> 19:52.680
I can remember my father.

19:53.276 --> 19:54.777
Are you sure?

20:20.970 --> 20:22.471
Positive.

20:31.898 --> 20:32.887
Sorry.

20:32.982 --> 20:33.971
It's okay.

20:35.610 --> 20:39.148
I still don't know
why you're doing
all this for me.

20:39.239 --> 20:42.276
Well, we're
an endangered species,
ljust...

20:44.327 --> 20:46.909
Doing my best to
try to save us.

20:46.996 --> 20:49.988
Hell, I didn't even know
there were others like me.

20:50.125 --> 20:51.740
I remember that feeling.

20:51.835 --> 20:54.326
So, how do I look?

20:57.799 --> 21:00.836
Like an exceptionally
cute boy who
can breathe underwater.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.510
You're special, Claire.

21:04.639 --> 21:09.258
And notjust
because of the whole
immortal, healing thing.

21:10.478 --> 21:13.015
I don't know, maybe if
things were different,

21:13.148 --> 21:15.685
we could've gone out
or something.

21:15.817 --> 21:16.852
We could've been
hiding in your bedroom

21:16.943 --> 21:18.899

different reasons.

21:22.699 --> 21:23.939
Even if things
were different,

21:24.033 --> 21:28.197
I'm not really into
the whole relationship
thing right now.

21:28.288 --> 21:29.403
Hmm.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.119
ltjust seems like
everyone who gets married

21:34.210 --> 21:35.711
gets a divorce.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.704
Okay, I think
it's more like half

21:38.840 --> 21:41.081
of all marriages get
a divorce or something.

21:41.217 --> 21:44.584
Yeah, but who knows
how happy that
other half is?

21:44.721 --> 21:46.211
I don't know.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.597
I still think it's worth it.

21:51.895 --> 21:53.055
VVhy?

21:54.272 --> 21:56.228
For moments like this.

21:57.442 --> 22:01.731
When someone gets you
the way that no one else does,

22:04.824 --> 22:06.906
it's definitely worth it.

coming toward the house.

the first place
they're gonna look.

whack it. Watch.

else in there.

I know about it.
Careful.

Okay. Now, close it.
Close it behind you.

in the Bennet house.

That is so weird.

supposed to be here.

wouldn't it?

are finished here,

23:35.331 --> 23:38.164

the hell out of my house.

the way you stood
up to that bitch.

celebrate yet.

give up so easily.

24:09.532 --> 24:11.864
We need to find a way
to get you to the station.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.942
You have both
done enough.

24:14.037 --> 24:16.699
Maybe I can slip out back,
make a run for it.

24:16.789 --> 24:18.040
No, they'll catch you.

24:18.207 --> 24:19.458
Maybe not.

24:21.669 --> 24:23.876
We're gonna give
him a head start.

24:49.280 --> 24:50.690
I think there's something
he wants us to see.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.898
What? What is it?
Come here. Come here.

24:52.992 --> 24:54.368
That's us.

24:55.244 --> 24:56.495
(EXCLAIMING) That's us.
That's the entire operation.

24:56.579 --> 24:58.945

on tape.

What are you doing?

25:00.750 --> 25:02.615
Copying the files.
What for?

25:02.835 --> 25:04.621
To expose them. Look...

rounded up like this,

25:06.422 --> 25:08.208
no warrants, no trials.

This is gonna look great
on the evening news.

25:10.051 --> 25:11.257
Nathan's not gonna
know what hit him.

25:11.344 --> 25:12.584
We'll use this
as leverage.

25:12.679 --> 25:13.885
Daphne's not here, Matt.

25:13.971 --> 25:15.711
There's no guarantee
that we're gonna find her.

25:15.807 --> 25:17.263
But if we have this...

25:17.350 --> 25:18.760
We can make a deal.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.352
Everything we've got
in exchange for Daphne.

Parkman's a telepath,
incredibly powerful,
but when he uses his ability

25:30.196 --> 25:33.859
his senses become raw nerves,
and he becomes susceptible.

25:33.950 --> 25:38.034
We exploit that,
we can disrupt his thoughts.

I need more time!

25:55.096 --> 25:56.427

Wait, wait.
Down, down.
Good, good, good.

26:16.492 --> 26:19.575
Don't do it.
This is only
gonna end badly.

26:21.330 --> 26:22.831
Don't do this!

26:23.791 --> 26:25.327

No, what about you?

You go. Go.

Matt, you know me.

26:37.472 --> 26:39.212
Nice and easy.

26:48.191 --> 26:50.147
Something terrible
happened here.

26:50.234 --> 26:51.223
What are you talking about?

26:51.319 --> 26:53.184
It's a toy car.
What's the big deal?

26:54.614 --> 26:55.979
No.

26:57.909 --> 27:00.116
My father did
something to me,

27:01.412 --> 27:03.152
something I forgot.

27:03.289 --> 27:05.029
Well, that's
a good thing, right?

27:06.250 --> 27:07.626
I mean,

all the crap

28:44.181 --> 28:46.342
So you didn't find Peter?

28:48.060 --> 28:50.597
You're not
helping him, are you?

28:50.688 --> 28:52.724
Don't be ridiculous.

28:52.815 --> 28:55.306
Someone's out there
calling himself Rebel.

28:55.401 --> 28:59.815
He knows where
Building 26 is,
how it runs.

29:00.323 --> 29:01.688
So I see.

29:02.408 --> 29:04.319
You have all
that information, too.

29:04.452 --> 29:06.363
Tell me this isn't you.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.361
Of course not.

29:08.497 --> 29:10.829
First of all,
I don't know the
first thing about computers.

29:10.917 --> 29:12.202
Yeah, you can hire
someone for that, Mom.

29:12.335 --> 29:14.997
And beyond that, I know who's
keeping me safe, Nathan.

29:15.087 --> 29:18.579
I can live my life in peace
thanks to your generosity.

29:18.674 --> 29:20.756
I would never betray you.

29:24.430 --> 29:27.718
Look, Peter...
He stole dangerous files,

29:27.850 --> 29:30.262
and there are people who want
him dead because of that.

29:30.353 --> 29:31.934
You're in charge.
You can protect him.

29:33.189 --> 29:34.725
to contain and control
these people with abilities,

29:34.857 --> 29:36.222
but there are other people

29:36.317 --> 29:38.524
that want to see them
all dead.

29:38.903 --> 29:42.521

experience with all this.

to killing us.

responsible for that.

In fact,
I'm the only one
who can fix it.

Why is that?
Because you're
one of us?

who really cares if
you're alive or not, Pete.

go after him right now.

footage taken directly

be a clear violation

constitutional rights.

tell me? Really?

close to the border

and we can rob
some old ladies.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.475

express my feelings.

some joyride, an escape.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.026
There is no escape.

And you can never outrun it,

39:05.344 --> 39:06.424
Wait.

Where are you going?

39:10.474 --> 39:12.135
To find my father.

39:12.518 --> 39:15.134
Because now that
I've seen the truth,

39:17.606 --> 39:19.096
I want him to die.

39:21.109 --> 39:22.315
Wait.

39:32.329 --> 39:33.785
What are you doing?

39:34.998 --> 39:35.987
You must've realized

39:36.083 --> 39:38.540
there'd be consequences
for your actions.

39:38.627 --> 39:41.084
Yeah, when that
story breaks,
you're exposed,

39:41.171 --> 39:44.379
and the world will
see what you're doing.

innocent people.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.671
You're not innocent.

The world just
doesn't realize
how dangerous you are.

Now they will,

39:55.394 --> 39:58.557
and they'll beg me to
hunt you down and kill you.

hurt anyone.

41:19.394 --> 41:20.975
just the way you are.

41:23.065 --> 41:25.807
I wouldn't trade
this life for anything.

41:28.445 --> 41:29.776
Me neither.

41:31.573 --> 41:35.111
So, I made popcorn. Figured
we could watch a movie,

41:35.243 --> 41:36.904
some sappy love story.

41:37.079 --> 41:38.819
Sounds perfect.

41:42.125 --> 41:43.911
I'll be right down.

42:08.068 --> 42:09.433
(GASPS)

42:09.528 --> 42:10.859
Hey, Barbie.

42:12.239 --> 42:13.354
You!

42:14.116 --> 42:18.200
I got a message from
someone named Rebel.

42:22.791 --> 42:24.873
I need your help, Barbie.
