00:00.346 --> 00:01.887
<i>Previously on "Switched at birth"...</i>

00:01.887 --> 00:04.141
They say you're wanted
for assault and battery.

00:04.141 --> 00:06.101
- This has to be a mistake.
- No, it isn't.

00:06.101 --> 00:08.189
- You turned Angelo in!
- You what?

00:08.189 --> 00:09.353
I didn't turn anybody in.

00:09.353 --> 00:10.833
Your parents didn't turn Angelo in.

00:10.833 --> 00:13.489
- I did.
- Immigration has no record of him.

00:13.489 --> 00:16.725
They are so disorganized.
I mean he could be deported already

00:16.725 --> 00:17.835
and they wouldn't know.

00:17.835 --> 00:21.255
My ex came back into my
life a few months ago

00:21.255 --> 00:23.191
and I'm just not ready.

00:23.191 --> 00:25.421
I thought we were in this
together... as a team.

00:25.421 --> 00:27.761
But lately you've been
acting like a free agent.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.491
Full disclosure: I have always
had a thing for redheads.

00:30.491 --> 00:32.993
_

00:32.993 --> 00:34.593
I know. I'm sorry.

00:35.841 --> 00:37.537
I have a bottle of vodka in my room.

00:37.537 --> 00:40.787
I was planning on having a few
shots and watching pay-per-view.

00:42.835 --> 00:44.785
- You hooked up with Emmett?
- I am asking you

00:44.785 --> 00:47.485
to just let this one die
for everybody's sake.

00:53.034 --> 00:54.366
Hey, what's up?

00:54.366 --> 00:56.732
How was your history test?

01:03.168 --> 01:04.843
Is something going on?

01:04.843 --> 01:09.816
_

01:11.131 --> 01:14.002
Okay. It seems sort of serious.

01:14.002 --> 01:15.672
Emmett, whatever it is, we...

01:17.828 --> 01:20.180
Wow! Emmett, whoa.

01:20.180 --> 01:21.902
Uh... I...

01:28.558 --> 01:31.403
Those are earplugs.
You're giving me earplugs?

01:31.403 --> 01:33.737
_

01:34.758 --> 01:36.459
Prom?

01:37.909 --> 01:39.257
What are these for?

01:39.257 --> 01:42.824
_

01:45.073 --> 01:47.264
Prom... you're inviting me to prom.

01:47.264 --> 01:48.886
_

01:48.886 --> 01:50.227
_

01:50.227 --> 01:51.602
You suck.

01:52.934 --> 01:54.225
_

01:54.996 --> 01:57.281
_

01:57.746 --> 01:58.636
To prom?

02:00.761 --> 02:03.176
Yes. Yes, I will.

02:14.855 --> 02:16.197
Ugh, I have to go.

02:16.648 --> 02:18.815
- I have a 3:00.
- Oh, come on.

02:18.849 --> 02:20.782
Blow off work.

02:20.815 --> 02:22.037
We'll take a nap together.

02:22.949 --> 02:23.971
I can't.

02:24.715 --> 02:26.782
You better not be
flirting with this client

02:26.815 --> 02:27.830
as much as you flirted with me.

02:28.059 --> 02:31.092
She's 72... attractive,

02:31.384 --> 02:33.092
- but not my type.
- Good.

02:34.630 --> 02:38.377
Oh, um, I forgot

02:38.377 --> 02:43.024
to tell you that Saturday
is Daphne's prom.

02:43.024 --> 02:45.862
- Okay.
- And, um,

02:45.862 --> 02:47.819
my mom's going to be out of town

02:47.819 --> 02:50.450
and Daphne is going to be home late.

02:51.716 --> 02:54.121
- Very late.
- Aha.

02:54.991 --> 02:56.017
Interesting.

02:57.647 --> 03:00.779
Yeah, I thought
you might found that interesting.

03:13.832 --> 03:18.697
I might have misjudged
the size of the letters.

03:18.697 --> 03:21.095
I still have to add on the "With me."

03:22.250 --> 03:23.872
What are the, uh, the...

03:24.247 --> 03:26.786
Gingerbread smurf people?

03:27.262 --> 03:29.265
That's Wilke and me.

03:30.295 --> 03:31.306
Right, right.

03:31.916 --> 03:33.035
It's gonna be great.

03:33.035 --> 03:34.353
It's just that at Buckner,

03:34.353 --> 03:38.226
people ask each other to
prom with kind of a twist.

03:38.963 --> 03:40.583
Carlton too.

03:46.567 --> 03:48.434
It's really lame, isn't it?

03:50.368 --> 03:52.434
You're really good at basketball.

03:52.741 --> 03:56.534
I know that a deaf prom
isn't Wilke's thing,

03:56.567 --> 03:59.302
but I really want him to come.

03:59.335 --> 04:02.402
Will you help me? You're so much
better at this stuff than me.

04:02.893 --> 04:03.935
Sure.

04:05.402 --> 04:06.113
Thank you.

04:11.434 --> 04:13.434
Ta-dah.

04:13.467 --> 04:16.235
Wow. Where are you going?

04:16.267 --> 04:19.634
Hello? The prom.
You volunteered us to chaperone.

04:21.180 --> 04:23.882
this is the same color dress
I wore at our rehearsal dinner.

04:23.882 --> 04:25.310
It still suits you.

04:25.310 --> 04:30.122
Not exactly the reaction I was hoping for.

04:31.296 --> 04:34.253
I appreciate what
you're trying to do, Kathryn...

04:34.253 --> 04:37.654
Hey, hope I'm not interrupting.
Toby let me in.

04:37.654 --> 04:40.150
- You look amazing.
- Yeah, we're going to the prom.

04:40.486 --> 04:41.686
What's up, Craig?

04:41.686 --> 04:43.011
My PI finished running the numbers

04:43.011 --> 04:45.838
on the phone you found in
Angelo's storage locker.

04:45.838 --> 04:48.248
Several of the calls came
from inside the hospital.

04:48.248 --> 04:50.534
I found the name of a lactation consultant

04:50.534 --> 04:52.768
who was on that night
but was never deposed.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.314
Colleen Vandernoot.
Does that ring any bells?

04:55.794 --> 04:58.514
Uh, no, I think I'd remember that name.

04:58.514 --> 05:01.786
I thought we could go talk to her together
and maybe it would ** your memory.

05:01.786 --> 05:03.294
- Okay.
- Great, I'm in.

05:03.294 --> 05:06.436
I'm concern that
if you're going together that,

05:06.436 --> 05:08.715
well, she might
feel a little intimidated.

05:08.715 --> 05:10.497
- "Intimidated"... you mean me.

05:10.497 --> 05:12.766
I just think... all right, you two go.

05:12.766 --> 05:14.701
Just do me a favor:
leave your checkbook here

05:14.734 --> 05:17.661
and please try to return in
the same car you leave in.

05:24.940 --> 05:27.434
This is perfect! You're a genius.

05:28.537 --> 05:29.634
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:29.951 --> 05:31.477
Bay's helping me come up

05:31.477 --> 05:34.584
with a great new way to ask Wilke to prom.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.777
What about my banner- on-his-car idea?

05:38.073 --> 05:40.985
I was wondering... would you be interested

05:40.985 --> 05:43.060
in doing my hair for the prom.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.693
Oh, yes!

05:44.693 --> 05:46.782
- Yes!
- Really?

05:47.085 --> 05:49.240
Oh, you have such beautiful hair,

05:49.240 --> 05:53.392
and I've been wanting to get
my hands on it for a really long time.

05:54.128 --> 05:55.952
A really long time.

05:58.019 --> 05:58.907
If that's okay with you.

05:58.907 --> 06:01.423
I don't want to interfere
with your hair plans.

06:01.423 --> 06:05.219
Oh please. I have been her hair guinea pig

06:05.219 --> 06:08.364
for years now. I'll be happy for a break.

06:08.720 --> 06:11.385
Oh, and I have millions of ideas.

06:11.385 --> 06:13.125
Let me just go get my magazines.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.402
Uh, it's blocked.

06:18.821 --> 06:21.076
- That's weird. Can you get it?
- Sure.

06:21.835 --> 06:22.662
Hello?

06:25.732 --> 06:26.995
No, it's Bay.

06:28.024 --> 06:29.423
How are you?

06:33.486 --> 06:35.357
Sure, hold on.

06:39.048 --> 06:40.457
He wants to talk to you.

06:41.576 --> 06:42.478
Who?

06:46.301 --> 06:47.389
Angelo.

07:11.073 --> 07:11.876
Gina.

07:12.545 --> 07:14.445
Thank you for coming.

07:15.545 --> 07:17.380
How are the girls?

07:17.412 --> 07:18.412
They're fine.

07:20.230 --> 07:20.994
Sit down.

07:28.104 --> 07:30.445
They're treating me like a criminal.

07:31.298 --> 07:32.538
You are a criminal.

07:33.858 --> 07:36.280
I went back to Italy
to clear everything up.

07:36.313 --> 07:37.746
For us.

07:37.779 --> 07:41.111
And when I came back,
they detained me at the airport.

07:41.111 --> 07:42.712
You could have let me know where you were.

07:42.746 --> 07:45.346
As far as I knew, you'd vanished... again.

07:45.380 --> 07:47.779
- I did try to call you.
- You never left a message.

07:48.040 --> 07:50.850
I was trying to keep you out of it...
you and the girls.

07:50.850 --> 07:53.179
Keep us out of it? We're in it.
The minute you come back...

07:53.179 --> 07:56.646
I was trying to do the right thing, Gina.

07:59.618 --> 08:00.941
So what are you going to do?

08:02.573 --> 08:05.380
I hate to ask you for anything,

08:05.585 --> 08:07.612
but I'm gonna need an immigration lawyer.

08:08.329 --> 08:12.186
I have one in Italy,
but I need someone here.

08:13.071 --> 08:15.380
Even if I get you
a lawyer and you get out,

08:15.412 --> 08:17.346
you can't come back.

08:17.380 --> 08:18.686
I'm still the girls' father.

08:18.686 --> 08:19.550
with me.

08:20.275 --> 08:21.882
You can't come back with me. We're done.

08:21.882 --> 08:24.380
Gina, I've thought of you constantly.

08:24.412 --> 08:27.313
Everything I do is for us to
finally get back together.

08:27.346 --> 08:29.479
No. You can't keep
disappearing and coming back

08:29.512 --> 08:31.712
and turning my life upside down.
I won't do it anymore.

08:34.005 --> 08:35.511
The girls can make their own decisions about you,

08:36.113 --> 08:37.544
but my mind is made up.

08:41.409 --> 08:44.044
I'll see what I can do
about getting you a lawyer.

08:54.316 --> 08:57.349
So is Bay going anywhere after prom?

08:57.910 --> 09:00.295
I don't know yet. What about Daphne?

09:00.295 --> 09:03.249
I haven't asked yet.

09:03.249 --> 09:06.041
Well, Toby and a bunch of his friends,

09:06.041 --> 09:07.111
they rented a hotel suite

09:07.111 --> 09:09.462
after the Buckner prom. It's what they do.

09:09.462 --> 09:10.928
Although, I have to admit,

09:10.928 --> 09:12.744
it feels a little different with girls.

09:13.603 --> 09:16.323
So what did you say to Toby?

09:16.937 --> 09:19.838
Well, at the advice of a counselor friend,

09:19.838 --> 09:24.202
I told John to go out and
buy a box of condoms.

09:24.236 --> 09:27.022
And we told him that we were
putting them in his bathroom

09:27.022 --> 09:29.706
and that we expected him to be responsible

09:29.706 --> 09:33.413
If he was having sex,
but we weren't encouraging it.

09:33.413 --> 09:36.277
And then I promised not
to count the condoms.

09:40.652 --> 09:42.685
- What?
- Nothing.

09:43.719 --> 09:45.269
- Nothing.
- Nothing.

10:08.603 --> 10:10.860
You have the right to remain silent.

10:10.860 --> 10:13.544
Anything you sign can be used against you,

10:14.537 --> 10:17.614
because I'm taking you
to the Carlton prom.

10:20.241 --> 10:22.007
It's this Saturday.

10:23.607 --> 10:24.770
Uh, Daphne, I...

10:24.770 --> 10:27.074
I thought you'd like the handcuffs.

10:27.450 --> 10:31.669
Look, I'd love to go, but I can't.

10:32.108 --> 10:33.007
I'm... I'm sorry.

10:33.040 --> 10:35.074
I have this modern civ
paper due on Monday.

10:35.107 --> 10:36.485
My dad's on my ass about my grades.

10:36.485 --> 10:37.836
He won't let me out of the house.

10:39.040 --> 10:40.850
Can't you get an extension?

10:40.850 --> 10:42.974
This is the extension of the extension.

10:44.038 --> 10:45.207
You know I wanna go.

10:45.241 --> 10:47.274
If there was any other way...

10:47.307 --> 10:48.274
No, I know.

10:48.725 --> 10:50.787
It's okay... really.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.508
I guess I should let you go.

11:06.937 --> 11:08.282
Hi, prom!

11:08.713 --> 11:09.795
Oh god, the only thing that

11:09.795 --> 11:11.497
would make her happier
is a double wedding.

11:11.497 --> 11:12.747
Very funny.

11:13.100 --> 11:14.187
Here.

11:17.461 --> 11:19.594
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:19.628 --> 11:21.594
She's been eyeing it since she was five.

11:21.628 --> 11:23.528
I was saving it for a big night.

11:24.297 --> 11:27.425
I take back anything snarky
that I may have just said.

11:27.664 --> 11:29.327
Thank you, mom.

11:31.294 --> 11:32.389
You're welcome.

11:33.147 --> 11:34.953
I don't know what you're gonna be wearing,

11:34.953 --> 11:38.761
but this is like a magic purse...
it goes with everything.

11:40.628 --> 11:44.327
Oh, thank you so much. It's perfect

11:45.327 --> 11:46.728
I am so excited!

11:46.761 --> 11:49.661
Take a bunch of pictures of you
guys and your dates together!

11:51.293 --> 11:52.292
Bye.

11:54.594 --> 11:56.594
Great, now I'm disappointing her too.

11:57.594 --> 11:58.702
What are you talking about?

12:00.282 --> 12:02.093
I'm not going to the prom.

12:02.093 --> 12:04.710
Wilke can't come. He has a paper due.

12:05.494 --> 12:07.688
I'm sorry, are we talking
about the same Wilke?

12:08.048 --> 12:11.227
Tall, blonde, really in love with himself,

12:11.261 --> 12:12.471
no interest in school?

12:12.471 --> 12:16.561
He said his dad grounded him
until the paper was finished.

12:16.764 --> 12:19.561
Well, forget Wilke.
You don't need him to go.

12:19.594 --> 12:22.561
Lots of people go without
dates at Buckner.

12:22.594 --> 12:24.081
They just hang out with their friends.

12:24.081 --> 12:25.810
It has to be the same at Carlton.

12:26.944 --> 12:27.846
I guess.

12:28.179 --> 12:32.561
And you got me and you got Emmett
and you got the magic purse!

12:32.594 --> 12:36.196
And I'll be there making
horrifying A.S.L. blunders

12:36.196 --> 12:39.161
that will provide hilarious
memories for years to come.

12:39.161 --> 12:40.617
You can't miss that.

12:41.898 --> 12:43.741
Okay, I'll go.

12:48.561 --> 12:51.410

12:51.749 --> 12:53.142

12:53.541 --> 12:55.676

12:55.689 --> 12:58.894

12:58.894 --> 13:01.864

13:01.877 --> 13:04.775

13:04.847 --> 13:07.632

13:07.712 --> 13:09.558

13:09.634 --> 13:13.309

13:13.371 --> 13:14.878

13:15.415 --> 13:17.982
_

13:18.863 --> 13:22.026
_

13:22.160 --> 13:26.087
_

13:26.196 --> 13:28.441
_

13:28.537 --> 13:33.018
_

13:36.874 --> 13:39.874
Mrs. Vandernoot, we are thrilled
you agreed to meet with us,

13:39.907 --> 13:42.473
but we haven't been
able to find any record

13:42.506 --> 13:44.171
of you having ever worked at the hospital.

13:44.171 --> 13:46.807
Oh, I was an independent contractor.

13:47.657 --> 13:50.773
I'm afraid I don't remember
you or the other mom.

13:50.807 --> 13:53.007
But I've read about your story.

13:53.007 --> 13:56.363
I can't even imagine
what you've been through.

13:56.363 --> 13:57.115
Thank you.

13:57.958 --> 13:59.740
Were there any hospital policies

13:59.773 --> 14:02.540
that might have contributed to the switch?

14:02.573 --> 14:05.001
Nurses' hours, a lack of oversight?

14:05.001 --> 14:08.640
Oh, absolutely.
Those nurses were run ragged.

14:09.198 --> 14:12.900
We were just transitioning to
a computer system back then,

14:12.900 --> 14:16.030
so they were still writing all
the babies' names with pen.

14:16.122 --> 14:19.864
Well, you can imagine
the different handwriting,

14:19.864 --> 14:22.571
smudges, bracelets slipping off...

14:23.164 --> 14:24.124
Frankly,

14:25.069 --> 14:28.368
I'm surprised it didn't
happen more often than it did.

14:33.335 --> 14:36.740
I'm really happy to testify
to whatever you need.

14:39.498 --> 14:41.565
This is fantastic. We're both so grateful

14:41.598 --> 14:44.231
for your courage in coming forward.

14:44.264 --> 14:46.331
This is a huge break for us.

14:46.364 --> 14:48.498
Of course! I'm glad to do it.

14:48.531 --> 14:51.631
That hospital's been
a lawsuit waiting to happen.

14:54.231 --> 14:57.431
'Cause once they got that
computer system up and running,

14:57.464 --> 15:00.531
they started imprinting
the babies with bar codes.

15:02.164 --> 15:03.206
Bar codes?

15:03.206 --> 15:07.097
Yeah, I'm not sure I understand either.

15:07.436 --> 15:09.630
Well, they're laying the groundwork

15:09.630 --> 15:11.498
for the coming of the anti-christ.

15:18.197 --> 15:21.464
So tonight... are you nervous?

15:22.333 --> 15:23.331
Yeah!

15:24.047 --> 15:26.531
It's like my signing coming-out party.

15:26.565 --> 15:29.131
Or like the A.S.L. final.

15:30.197 --> 15:32.498
Do you remember your first all-deaf party?

15:32.531 --> 15:36.231
Oh god, yeah. Melody took me way too soon.

15:36.264 --> 15:39.164
Your signing is much better than mine was.

15:41.331 --> 15:42.563
- Regina?
- Mm-hmm?

15:42.563 --> 15:44.531
This is going to be so beautiful.

15:48.264 --> 15:50.164
Did Angelo ask about me?

15:50.526 --> 15:52.197
Of course.

15:52.532 --> 15:54.565
He wanted to make sure
that you were all right.

15:55.842 --> 15:58.164
Do you think he's gonna be able to stay?

15:58.451 --> 16:00.197
I...

16:00.231 --> 16:01.531
I don't know.

16:04.705 --> 16:08.298
But he knows that we want him here, right?

16:08.530 --> 16:11.298
Bay, even if he gets to stay,

16:11.331 --> 16:13.398
it's not going to be
the way it was before.

16:13.621 --> 16:15.095
I told him that none of us

16:15.096 --> 16:18.231
wants to keep going on
the Angelo roller coaster.

16:19.431 --> 16:21.531
So he doesn't know that we want him.

16:23.264 --> 16:25.631
He knows what to realistically expect.

16:34.812 --> 16:36.431
Yes?

16:36.464 --> 16:40.164
Hi, I'm Daphne. I brought
Wilke some lemon bars.

16:41.016 --> 16:42.331
Oh, how nice.

16:42.878 --> 16:44.221
And how nice to finally meet you.

16:44.221 --> 16:45.594
Come in, come in.

16:49.298 --> 16:51.298
Hey, I'm gonna have to call you back.

16:51.748 --> 16:53.298
Yeah, that works.

16:53.331 --> 16:56.364
I was starting to believe that
you didn't actually exist.

16:56.789 --> 17:00.197
Oh no, I'm totally real.

17:01.681 --> 17:03.498
James has told us so much about you.

17:03.531 --> 17:04.329
You'r...

17:05.079 --> 17:08.397
you're just so different from
anybody that he's ever dated.

17:08.758 --> 17:12.196
- Is that a good thing?
- Well, for him, absolutely.

17:12.231 --> 17:14.464
But given what he's told us about you,

17:14.498 --> 17:17.164
I'm not so sure what you see in him.

17:18.364 --> 17:20.531
Wilke's great... funny, smart.

17:22.364 --> 17:24.298
Is he here?

17:24.330 --> 17:28.531
No, he snuck off again without
telling me where he was going.

17:29.024 --> 17:33.131
I assume it's one final act
of rebellion before he leaves.

17:33.164 --> 17:35.298
Leaves? Is he going somewhere?

17:35.762 --> 17:37.431
Boarding school.

17:40.164 --> 17:41.598
Did you just say "Boarding school"?

17:42.598 --> 17:44.498
He didn't tell you, did he?

17:45.498 --> 17:47.231
No.

17:50.391 --> 17:51.565
I'm sorry.

17:52.944 --> 17:55.398
- It was nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

18:04.561 --> 18:07.915
No. Victory! Victory and gardner.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.323
Yes it's a flat tire

18:10.323 --> 18:13.475
can... look, we have been
waiting here an hour already.

18:14.463 --> 18:16.320
As soon as you can... thank you.

18:38.303 --> 18:39.603
_

18:39.677 --> 18:42.307
No, the bike looks amazing.

18:42.307 --> 18:43.212
_

18:43.867 --> 18:46.084
_

18:51.472 --> 18:53.620
Ohhh. Here.

18:56.139 --> 18:57.833
This is a night to remember.

18:59.329 --> 19:01.007
_

19:06.694 --> 19:08.201
You put my name on it.

19:09.548 --> 19:12.802
That is way cooler than a corsage.

19:16.105 --> 19:17.239
Have fun.

19:18.406 --> 19:20.709
Tell Daphne that we'll meet her there.

19:20.709 --> 19:22.070
Okay.

19:22.843 --> 19:23.788
Bye.

19:33.262 --> 19:34.814
_

19:36.171 --> 19:37.559
It's Angelo.

19:38.182 --> 19:40.796
I'm sorry. I hate that I'm
thinking about this tonight,

19:40.796 --> 19:43.227
but it sounds like Regina made him feel

19:43.227 --> 19:45.030
like no one wants him here

19:45.718 --> 19:47.774
and I don't want him to leave

19:47.774 --> 19:50.214
before I get the chance to see him again.

19:50.309 --> 19:52.197
_

19:52.717 --> 19:54.408
We can't go now.

19:54.408 --> 19:55.736
_

19:56.087 --> 19:58.967
Because... it's your prom.

19:58.967 --> 20:00.450
_

20:00.831 --> 20:02.916
_

20:21.891 --> 20:24.018
_

20:44.280 --> 20:45.191
_

20:45.338 --> 20:47.259
_

20:48.354 --> 20:50.045
_

20:51.094 --> 20:53.833
_

20:54.001 --> 20:55.662
_

20:55.784 --> 20:58.523
_

20:58.678 --> 21:00.499
_

21:02.232 --> 21:04.552
_

21:04.887 --> 21:07.098
_

21:07.253 --> 21:11.147
_

21:11.872 --> 21:14.461
_

21:16.915 --> 21:20.548
_

21:20.657 --> 21:23.418
_

21:24.282 --> 21:25.675
_

21:25.889 --> 21:27.147
_

21:41.887 --> 21:43.720
Finished my paper early.

21:43.753 --> 21:45.920
You still up for a little prom action?

21:50.402 --> 21:51.548
What the hell?

21:54.714 --> 21:56.063
I turn my phone off for a few hours

21:56.063 --> 21:57.860
and you go find yourself another date?

21:58.470 --> 22:01.158
It's not a date and you didn't
tell me you were coming.

22:01.298 --> 22:03.114
I wanted to surprise you!

22:03.879 --> 22:06.536
Yeah, I guess you're full of surprises.

22:07.681 --> 22:11.407
_

22:12.069 --> 22:13.912
- What did he say?
- He wants to know

22:13.913 --> 22:15.364
how your paper's going.

22:16.295 --> 22:18.113
It's great, man. I'll let you read it.

22:18.114 --> 22:19.191
Can we get out of here?

22:19.192 --> 22:20.637
I kinda have this whole
night planned for us.

22:20.638 --> 22:22.913
Yes, just give me a minute.

22:22.914 --> 22:25.920
Okay. Thanks for the gesture,
but I got this.

22:28.609 --> 22:30.940
We're gonna give him a ride to prom.

22:32.010 --> 22:32.730
Are you kidding?

22:34.358 --> 22:38.398
_

22:50.222 --> 22:51.348
Hey.

22:53.035 --> 22:54.060
No touching.

22:58.786 --> 23:00.243
Look how gorgeous you are.

23:00.735 --> 23:04.101
Thank you. I'm going to
my boyfriend's prom actually.

23:04.460 --> 23:05.971
He's waiting outside right now.

23:05.972 --> 23:07.261
I can't wait to meet him.

23:07.719 --> 23:09.551
Sit down, please. Sit down.

23:14.757 --> 23:18.244
So what happened?
I mean you just disappeared.

23:19.034 --> 23:21.436
I just wanted to clear everything up

23:21.468 --> 23:22.888
and just be done with it.

23:24.715 --> 23:27.679
Why didn't you call? I was really worried.

23:28.209 --> 23:29.145
I'm sorry.

23:29.173 --> 23:31.991
I just knew your parents
were badmouthing me.

23:31.992 --> 23:35.154
And I figured I would wait
until I see you on my own.

23:35.300 --> 23:37.195
They weren't badmouthing you.

23:37.454 --> 23:39.857
I'm sure they were not
so upset that I was gone.

23:40.561 --> 23:42.325
If Adrianna hadn't called immigration,

23:42.326 --> 23:43.990
I'm sure your parents would have done it.

23:43.991 --> 23:47.683
No, they were actually
going to try to help you.

23:52.028 --> 23:53.680
Well, what happens next?

23:54.409 --> 23:56.741
Um, I'm going to try everything I can do

23:56.742 --> 23:59.646
to stay here... I mean not here.

24:01.465 --> 24:03.881
Can I do anything? Do you need anything?

24:04.498 --> 24:05.824
No no.

24:07.688 --> 24:08.853
There is something.

24:11.490 --> 24:15.163
I'm trying to call my
lawyer in Italy but...

24:15.338 --> 24:16.261
But?

24:18.005 --> 24:20.625
But I have to pay for
those calls personally,

24:20.918 --> 24:22.895
and I've run through everything.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.959
I have like $40.

24:43.119 --> 24:44.105
Do you mind?

24:44.956 --> 24:45.950
Does he mind?

24:48.312 --> 24:49.821
Hey hey, buddy?

24:50.876 --> 24:54.122
Did you rent that shirt or do you own it?

24:54.123 --> 24:55.393
- Wilke!
- Sorry.

24:55.394 --> 24:57.031
But he's ruining this.

24:57.032 --> 24:59.645
Well, maybe you should've
answered my texts.

25:00.018 --> 25:01.794
I told you. My phone was off.

25:01.874 --> 25:04.848
I was writing my paper. And then I was out

25:04.849 --> 25:06.725
planning the perfect prom night,

25:06.785 --> 25:08.214
which at least someone is enjoying.

25:32.587 --> 25:34.547
_

25:34.719 --> 25:36.141
_

25:37.639 --> 25:39.874
Are you kidding? After that

25:39.875 --> 25:42.087
there is nothing I want more

25:42.311 --> 25:43.156
than to be here.

25:43.906 --> 25:44.959
_

25:45.098 --> 25:47.099
_

26:17.327 --> 26:19.536
Come on, car wash guy's gone.

26:19.537 --> 26:21.119
It's just you and me,

26:21.430 --> 26:24.328
and music so loud
it'll make your ears bleed.

26:25.330 --> 26:27.927
Did your dad tell you I stopped by today?

26:30.318 --> 26:33.178
No, I haven't seen him since this morning.

26:34.458 --> 26:36.841
Why, did he say something?

26:38.384 --> 26:39.489
Yeah, he did.

26:40.574 --> 26:42.923
He said you were going to boarding school.

26:46.358 --> 26:49.059
- Yeah, I was gonna get to that.
- Really? When?

26:49.686 --> 26:51.389
When were you gonna get to that?

26:51.390 --> 26:52.616
After prom.

26:54.690 --> 26:57.398
Look, my grades suck.

26:57.743 --> 27:00.033
I thought maybe if I aced this paper,

27:00.597 --> 27:01.730
I could convince him to

27:01.731 --> 27:03.765
give me one more chance
to stay at Buckner.

27:03.879 --> 27:05.613
But then I realized
with only two days left,

27:05.614 --> 27:07.703
there was no way I could finish the paper,

27:07.704 --> 27:08.778
let alone ace it.

27:09.734 --> 27:12.631
So I just chucked it in
and came out with you.

27:14.142 --> 27:16.348
And you never said a word.

27:16.735 --> 27:18.386
I was hoping I'd figure it out.

27:18.962 --> 27:20.994
I don't even know why
you bothered to tell me at all.

27:20.995 --> 27:23.451
- You should have just disappeared.
- Daphne.

27:23.452 --> 27:24.842
I'm sorry.

27:39.008 --> 27:43.142
Hi. I don't know the sign for alcohol,

27:43.143 --> 27:46.637
but I'm pretty sure you're not
supposed to be drinking it.

27:48.400 --> 27:52.633
Oh, you drinky no.

27:54.583 --> 27:56.188
Uh-huh, let's have it.

27:57.691 --> 27:59.707
I'll take that and the flask.

28:01.118 --> 28:02.103
Very good.

28:04.578 --> 28:06.676
Is the chicken marsala that bad?

28:06.884 --> 28:08.935
Or should I be taking this as a hint?

28:08.997 --> 28:09.882
What?

28:11.577 --> 28:14.333
Oh. Um, I'm sorry.

28:14.334 --> 28:16.878
It's just Angelo, my ex,

28:16.879 --> 28:19.352
- well, whatever...
- I know who he is.

28:19.538 --> 28:21.809
Okay, just John said that

28:21.810 --> 28:23.625
he would try to find him
an immigration lawyer,

28:23.626 --> 28:25.891
and I know that Bay and
Daphne are waiting...

28:28.084 --> 28:30.013
You know what? Never mind.

28:30.064 --> 28:31.915
- You can tell me about it.
- No.

28:32.022 --> 28:36.753
I mean, I appreciate that,
but I shouldn't be...

28:38.892 --> 28:42.171
Here I am on a date with a great guy,

28:42.246 --> 28:45.297
a wonderful, interesting guy,

28:45.298 --> 28:48.298
who hasn't once mentioned needing a lawyer

28:48.338 --> 28:49.823
or being deported.

28:50.092 --> 28:51.052
So that's all I have to do to

28:51.053 --> 28:54.102
get good credit is not
mention being deported?

28:54.917 --> 28:55.821
Crap.

28:55.822 --> 28:57.980
There goes my dessert conversation.

28:58.400 --> 28:59.300
Okay.

29:01.314 --> 29:03.541
I am here with you,

29:04.123 --> 29:04.813
end of story.

29:08.825 --> 29:11.271
_

29:11.468 --> 29:13.197
_

29:14.042 --> 29:16.026
Sure. No problem.

29:16.580 --> 29:17.328
I'm totally fine.

29:17.329 --> 29:20.255
I'm just gonna stand here
and try to look deaf.

29:20.429 --> 29:22.250
_

29:32.067 --> 29:34.238
Were you requesting
"Taking care of business"?

29:34.239 --> 29:35.163
What?

29:35.635 --> 29:37.642
Were you requesting
"Taking care of business"?

29:37.643 --> 29:40.546
Honey, that is not a bad song.

29:41.027 --> 29:41.962
I said

29:41.963 --> 29:45.201
'cause I like to party party.

29:45.202 --> 29:46.529
Okay, I'm sorry.

29:47.845 --> 29:49.231
I'm terrible.

29:52.288 --> 29:55.247
No, actually,

29:56.233 --> 29:57.433
you're pretty great.

29:59.062 --> 30:02.027
- C'mere.
- Oh no, that's far too much.

30:02.028 --> 30:03.446
- Okay.
- Okay.

30:04.179 --> 30:07.177
I can't believe I'm missing
my daughter's prom.

30:07.178 --> 30:09.420
I really thought this whole thing

30:09.421 --> 30:11.544
would take two hours max. I am so sorry.

30:11.545 --> 30:14.361
I promise these guys
are like a minute away.

30:15.255 --> 30:16.508
I just hope our tow-truck

30:16.509 --> 30:18.613
driver doesn't have the mark of the devil.

30:18.614 --> 30:20.636
- Bizarre, right?
- I know!

30:20.637 --> 30:22.856
She's definitely not going
to make a credible witness,

30:22.857 --> 30:24.473
but I'll tell you what.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.363
There was some pretty useful
stuff in all that crazy.

30:26.364 --> 30:28.551
- Really? I hope so.
- Yeah.

30:28.552 --> 30:30.739
Hey, you're cold.
Let me give you my jacket.

30:30.740 --> 30:31.476
- Oh no no no.
- Naw, come on.

30:31.477 --> 30:32.822
- I'll just go sit in the car.
- Wear it, really.

30:32.823 --> 30:34.922
- Honestly, I don't want to.
- Really nice and warm.

30:34.923 --> 30:37.883
- I'm not gonna let you freeze.
- Honestly, I...

30:43.375 --> 30:44.304
Oh.

30:45.174 --> 30:47.212
- Um...
- I am so sorry.

30:47.213 --> 30:51.373
No. I... I... I just think
I better call my son

30:51.374 --> 30:53.176
and have him pick me up.

30:55.568 --> 30:57.087
It wasn't just you.

31:10.306 --> 31:12.525
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:12.817 --> 31:15.138
You guys are so late. Is everything okay?

31:15.152 --> 31:16.754
Yeah, we...

31:18.042 --> 31:20.296
I went to go see Angelo.

31:21.521 --> 31:23.038
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

31:23.135 --> 31:24.717
Do you want to hear about it?

31:24.793 --> 31:26.873
- Not really.
- Good,

31:26.874 --> 31:29.077
because I don't want to talk about it.

31:29.078 --> 31:32.041
I think we both deserve
one night free of drama,

31:32.042 --> 31:33.751
if that's humanly possible.

31:34.189 --> 31:35.091
Yeah.

31:35.257 --> 31:37.955
Well, my night is already ruined.

31:38.750 --> 31:40.500
Wilke is going to boarding school.

31:41.994 --> 31:42.970
Really?

31:44.994 --> 31:48.483
Damn. I know his dad has been
threatening that for years,

31:48.611 --> 31:51.398
but I had no idea that he was serious.

31:51.928 --> 31:54.020
Yeah. Well, he is.

31:55.453 --> 31:57.714
Aww, man. Good ol' Wilke.

31:58.113 --> 31:59.070
Yeah.

32:00.789 --> 32:03.161
Hey, why don't we get out of here

32:03.162 --> 32:05.179
and give him a proper send-off?

32:05.180 --> 32:08.193
We could hit the golf
course or worlds of fun.

32:08.659 --> 32:10.063
I'll call Toby and Simone

32:10.064 --> 32:12.162
and we'll have a night to remember.

32:21.592 --> 32:23.018
Oh... sheesh.

32:24.123 --> 32:26.050
Is there alcohol in the flask?

32:26.051 --> 32:27.722
No, there's no alcohol.

32:27.723 --> 32:30.216
It's more like lighter fluid.

32:48.706 --> 32:49.706
Show-off.

32:52.174 --> 32:53.898
_

32:54.529 --> 32:56.051
Kathryn is, um...

32:56.052 --> 32:58.944
out playing Nancy Drew

32:59.110 --> 33:01.068
with our attorney. Yeah, mm-hmm.

33:01.197 --> 33:02.692
Yeah, exactly.

33:04.659 --> 33:08.279
_

33:08.405 --> 33:10.546
"Been through a lot" yes.

33:10.858 --> 33:11.835
Yeah.

33:20.253 --> 33:22.003
Long something.

33:22.004 --> 33:23.971
- But I don't know what the rest of it...
- She said

33:24.369 --> 33:26.920
she envies your devotion.

33:26.923 --> 33:29.391
You're long-distance runners.

33:33.239 --> 33:34.391
Yes, we are.

33:35.651 --> 33:37.882
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

33:43.436 --> 33:44.820
Come on. You said nobody's home.

33:44.821 --> 33:47.030
I know. But I don't usually come in

33:47.031 --> 33:49.453
when they're not here.
It's kind of a thing.

33:49.454 --> 33:50.520
A thing?

33:51.179 --> 33:53.068
Wait! No lights.

33:53.929 --> 33:55.151
This is their home.

33:55.793 --> 33:57.563
- But you have the key.
- I know,

33:57.564 --> 34:00.518
but not for sneaking in the middle
of the night to steal condoms.

34:11.228 --> 34:13.409
Thanks for the lift, Toby. Hi honey!

34:13.409 --> 34:14.623
- Mom, no!
- What?

34:14.623 --> 34:15.918
No, don't...

34:16.351 --> 34:19.292
- I just wanted to say hi.
- No. Daphne either.

34:19.293 --> 34:22.214
Just go dance with dad.
I'm going to go get you some punch.

34:22.215 --> 34:23.618
Don't say hi to either of them.

34:29.321 --> 34:32.706
Hi.

34:32.708 --> 34:33.895
Do you

34:34.237 --> 34:35.648
want to dance?

34:37.295 --> 34:39.047
I would love to dance.

34:57.366 --> 34:59.707
I'm sorry I've been so hard on you lately.

35:02.377 --> 35:04.416
I haven't exactly been prince charming.

35:08.220 --> 35:09.680
I just want us back.

35:13.272 --> 35:14.250
Me too.

35:47.841 --> 35:48.988
You were right.

35:49.130 --> 35:50.938
Let's just put it all aside

35:50.939 --> 35:53.546
and have one last great night together.

35:53.649 --> 35:55.283
Or at least I'm going to try.

35:55.687 --> 35:56.626
I'm in.

35:57.373 --> 35:59.589
Bay was just saying maybe
we should all go out...

35:59.590 --> 36:02.058
her, Emmett, maybe Toby and Simone.

36:02.599 --> 36:05.022
Yeah, I don't know about
inviting those guys.

36:05.296 --> 36:06.642
Especially Emmett.

36:07.221 --> 36:09.151
What is the deal with you and Emmett?

36:09.152 --> 36:12.088
Since the day I met you,
you've given me crap about him.

36:12.346 --> 36:14.348
Honestly? I think the guy's a phony.

36:14.349 --> 36:18.097
A phony? Emmett is
the most real person I know.

36:18.200 --> 36:20.591
I don't think you know him
as well as you think you do.

36:21.917 --> 36:22.948
What'd you say?

36:23.778 --> 36:25.402
Forget it.

36:25.636 --> 36:26.920
No, say it.

36:29.251 --> 36:30.973
Emmett slept with Simone

36:30.974 --> 36:32.751
at the basketball tournament.

36:34.743 --> 36:36.049
Why would you say that?

36:36.135 --> 36:38.660
Because it's true. Simone told me.

36:38.661 --> 36:41.240
- Simone's a liar.
- Well yeah,

36:41.241 --> 36:42.391
maybe she lied.

36:42.424 --> 36:45.366
- When did she tell you this?
- At the movie shoot.

36:45.367 --> 36:48.476
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Because I don't want to get involved.

36:48.493 --> 36:51.721
This concerns my brother,
my best friend and Bay.

36:51.722 --> 36:53.142
You didn't think I should know?

36:53.143 --> 36:54.837
Well, I'm telling you now!

36:56.657 --> 36:57.711
Where are you going?

36:57.978 --> 36:59.003
What are you doing?

37:04.378 --> 37:05.561
I'm sorry to interrupt...

37:05.623 --> 37:08.199
_

37:21.430 --> 37:25.038
_

37:28.126 --> 37:29.649
_

37:30.035 --> 37:31.453
_

37:32.195 --> 37:33.588
_

37:34.108 --> 37:36.550
_

37:36.789 --> 37:40.191
_

37:40.523 --> 37:41.899
_

37:42.322 --> 37:45.632
_

37:47.097 --> 37:48.615
_

37:54.375 --> 37:55.680
_

37:55.772 --> 37:57.459
_

38:11.641 --> 38:12.870
He lied to me.

38:13.243 --> 38:16.303
He looked me in the eye and he lied to me.

38:17.148 --> 38:19.607
What am I supposed to do
with this information?

38:20.791 --> 38:22.924
I wasn't sure so I went with "Nothing."

38:25.152 --> 38:26.556
Simone said it was all a big mistake.

38:26.557 --> 38:28.846
It's not going to happen again,
for what that's worth.

38:31.058 --> 38:32.662
Look, I'll do whatever you want.

38:32.663 --> 38:34.613
If you want to tell Bay, we'll tell her.

38:36.302 --> 38:39.966
It's their night too.
I'm not sure I can ruin it for them.

38:39.967 --> 38:41.330
You can decide this tomorrow.

38:42.585 --> 38:45.109
Let's all have one last night,
just you and me,

38:45.110 --> 38:46.858
without any of this getting in the way.

39:05.860 --> 39:08.428
Hey... hey!

39:08.429 --> 39:10.380
All right, slow down.

39:11.065 --> 39:13.942
Okay. Wait wait... hold on.

39:14.233 --> 39:15.361
Oh, that is so much better.

39:15.362 --> 39:16.472
My ears can breathe!

39:20.641 --> 39:22.059
_

39:30.555 --> 39:31.658
_

39:36.159 --> 39:37.868
What's going on?

39:38.030 --> 39:40.027
_

39:41.002 --> 39:41.975
Mistake.

39:43.425 --> 39:44.366
What happened?

39:44.366 --> 39:46.716
Whatever it is, we can fix it.

39:50.750 --> 39:52.978
_

39:53.209 --> 39:54.908
_

39:55.667 --> 39:57.119
_

39:57.349 --> 39:58.532
_

40:01.398 --> 40:05.350
_

40:06.695 --> 40:07.704
Is this a joke...

40:08.397 --> 40:11.635
like the ring box with the earplugs?

40:12.104 --> 40:14.350
Because it's not funny.

40:25.268 --> 40:27.026
Daphne? You and Daphne?

40:28.434 --> 40:29.681
You slept with Daphne?

40:30.673 --> 40:32.680
But someone. You slept with someone.

40:35.118 --> 40:36.121
Emmett!

40:46.531 --> 40:47.650
But you don't even know her.

40:47.725 --> 40:49.735
_

40:54.417 --> 40:57.332
_

41:00.850 --> 41:02.406
Don't follow me.

41:11.449 --> 41:14.075
You know, I never fought so
hard for anyone in my life.

41:15.104 --> 41:16.961
I finally get her and I'm sent away.

41:18.225 --> 41:20.398
Come on. You're going
to forget all about me.

41:20.586 --> 41:22.313
Two weeks at that fancy boarding school

41:22.314 --> 41:24.465
and it'll be like, "Daphne who?"

41:25.395 --> 41:27.495
You are the one who is
going to forget about me.

41:29.226 --> 41:30.939
Yeah, probably.

41:31.477 --> 41:32.398
You are!

41:32.962 --> 41:34.330
You're going to go on to...

41:35.170 --> 41:39.009
I don't know, run some
four-star restaurant

41:39.608 --> 41:41.220
and marry some perfect guy

41:41.758 --> 41:43.570
and have like six perfect kids.

41:44.918 --> 41:47.384
And I'll be disowned by my family

41:47.385 --> 41:50.666
and forced to trade on
my looks to become a kept man.

41:53.349 --> 41:56.145
Do you really think that about yourself?

41:56.758 --> 41:58.289
That that's all you are?

42:02.980 --> 42:05.035
Hey, I'm serious. Listen to me.

42:06.059 --> 42:07.671
Don't shortchange yourself.

42:11.582 --> 42:12.609
C'mere.

42:28.396 --> 42:31.455
Hey, man. The sound is amazing.

42:32.412 --> 42:34.761
So where's Bay?

42:37.573 --> 42:39.389
_

42:40.241 --> 42:42.426
You okay? Something happen?

43:27.738 --> 43:29.204
Oh, you're home early.

43:29.205 --> 43:31.403
- Is everything okay?
- Oh yeah, sure.

43:31.506 --> 43:33.445
The lawyer that Craig
recommended called me

43:33.446 --> 43:35.743
and he's willing to take Angelo's case.

43:35.744 --> 43:37.512
I can't get pulled into this.

43:37.513 --> 43:39.090
Of course I want to help Angelo stay

43:39.091 --> 43:42.039
- for the girls' sake, but...
- Regina, any way we come at this,

43:42.040 --> 43:43.413
we're gonna be involved.

43:44.789 --> 43:46.132
Okay, come on in.

43:46.699 --> 43:47.678
Thank you.

43:52.481 --> 43:54.610
So what are his options?

43:55.052 --> 43:58.207
The lawyer can fight
deportation on the grounds

43:58.208 --> 44:00.786
that Angelo has been in
the country for 10 years.

44:00.792 --> 44:02.897
- Okay.
- But that probably is not gonna work

44:02.898 --> 44:04.871
because Angelo has a criminal record.

44:05.428 --> 44:09.016
Now he can fight deportation on
the grounds that it would cause

44:09.017 --> 44:12.523
undue hardship to his child...
who is a U.S. citizen.

44:12.524 --> 44:15.298
I don't want to do anything
where Bay has to testify.

44:15.299 --> 44:17.998
I agree 100% and it probably wouldn't work.

44:18.840 --> 44:21.767
So there isn't much that can be done.

44:21.771 --> 44:24.098
Well, he might be able to stay if...

44:26.016 --> 44:27.654
- If?
- I'm trying to remember

44:27.655 --> 44:29.853
the exact words the lawyer used.

44:30.098 --> 44:32.272
If Angelo...

44:32.530 --> 44:34.099
- Mm-hmm?
- In good faith,

44:34.907 --> 44:37.671
marries a U.S. citizen.
