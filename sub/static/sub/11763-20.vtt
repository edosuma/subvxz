WEBVTT

00:03.604 --> 00:04.705
NO LIGHTS.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.537
SWEETIE, YOU HAVE BEEN
LYING AROUND

00:06.537 --> 00:08.439
THIS DARK ROOM FOR TWO WEEKS.

00:08.439 --> 00:11.112
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE
TO PROPOSE TO SOMEONE

00:11.112 --> 00:14.045
AND HAVE THEM SAY NO, BUT WE'VE
ALL HAD OUR HEARTS BROKEN.

00:14.045 --> 00:17.048
I MEAN, WHEN YOUR DAD AND I
SPLIT UP, WE WERE BOTH CRUSHED.

00:17.048 --> 00:21.292
IT TOOK ME A YEAR
TO BOUNCE BACK.
WORST WEEKEND
OF MY LIFE. WHAT?

00:21.292 --> 00:24.155
I'M WORRIED YOU'RE
FALLING BEHIND AT SCHOOL.

00:24.155 --> 00:27.058
IT'S FINE. WE'VE HAD SPRING
BREAK FOR THE LAST TWO WEEKS.

00:27.058 --> 00:30.061
BACK IN OUR DAY,
WE'D BE DOWN IN DAYTONA BEACH,

00:30.061 --> 00:33.134
TEARING IT UP, CRASHING PARTIES,
PUNCHING COPS.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.306
YOU PUNCHED A COP?
(whistles)

00:35.306 --> 00:38.469
WELL, DON'T TRY TO STOP ME
IF I'M VOGUING ON TOP OF A CAB.

00:38.469 --> 00:39.470
I MEAN...

00:39.470 --> 00:41.672
(dance music plays)

00:41.672 --> 00:43.144
(chuckles)

00:43.144 --> 00:44.445
WAIT. ARE YOU LAUGHING?

00:44.445 --> 00:46.717
NO. COULDN'T BE.
THIS IS A SAD ROOM.

00:46.717 --> 00:49.120
THANK YOU. YOU CAN LEAVE NOW.

00:49.120 --> 00:51.122
ALL RIGHT.

00:51.122 --> 00:52.323
(rattle)

00:52.323 --> 00:53.824
(all, high-pitched voices)
PENNY CAN!

00:53.824 --> 00:56.827
GUYS, THAT WAS THREE IN A ROW.
THAT MEANS WE GO ROBOT.

00:56.827 --> 00:58.829
(all, robotic voices)
PENNY CAN.

00:58.829 --> 01:02.133
(imitates beeping sounds)
WE'RE ADULTS.

01:02.133 --> 01:04.435
WE ARE SO KICKING ASS
RIGHT NOW AS PARENTS. YEAH.
MM!

01:04.435 --> 01:07.138
NO, SERIOUSLY, I THINK
WE'RE ABOUT TO PULL TRAVIS

01:07.138 --> 01:09.800
OUT OF HIS DEPRESSION.
(gasps) RIM SHOT!
OW! (gasps)

01:09.800 --> 01:12.143
DID YOU KNOW THAT THESE TWO
ARE MAKING A KILLING

01:12.143 --> 01:13.644
WITH THEIR PENNY CAN
BUSINESS?

01:13.644 --> 01:15.206
WHAT?
WHOO!

01:15.206 --> 01:18.279
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO HELP THEM
MAKE SMART FINANCIAL CHOICES.

01:18.279 --> 01:21.612
YEAH, I WANT TO STOP
WORKING OUT OF MY BOAT

01:21.612 --> 01:24.715
AND BUILD A GIANT
CAN-SHAPED OFFICE.
IT'S NOT AN EASY JOB.

01:24.715 --> 01:27.418
WELL, I'M SO HAPPY FOR YOU BOTH.
(clank)

01:27.418 --> 01:29.860
(gasps)
SPINNER! FACE SANDWICH!

01:29.860 --> 01:32.223
OH! HOW IS IT STILL SPINNING?

01:32.223 --> 01:35.626
LAST CUP OF COFFEE--
WHO GETS IT?
(grunts)

01:35.626 --> 01:39.270
HMM, BEST FRIEND OR BOYFRIEND?
I'LL HEAR CLOSING ARGUMENTS.

01:39.270 --> 01:41.432
I LOVE YOU.
MM.

01:41.432 --> 01:44.705
I GOT YOU A BAGEL.
SORRY, DUDE. YOU CAN'T
EAT LOVE. GIVE IT TO ME.

01:44.705 --> 01:46.207
OHH.
WOW.

01:46.207 --> 01:47.878
CHICKS--AM I RIGHT?

01:47.878 --> 01:51.182
HELLO, TOM. TO WHAT DO WE OWE
THE CREEPY DISPLEASURE?

01:51.182 --> 01:53.184
JULES LEFT
HER CURTAINS OPEN.

01:53.184 --> 01:55.546
THAT'S HOW SHE SIGNALS ME
TO COME OVER.

01:55.546 --> 01:58.189
OH, SWEETIE, THAT'S SOMETHING
YOU JUSTTHINKIS TRUE,

01:58.189 --> 02:00.891
KIND OF LIKE WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT
A WOMAN'S PERIOD ATTRACTS BEES.

02:00.891 --> 02:03.724
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO BE CAREFUL.
TOM, POOF.

02:03.724 --> 02:05.226
(groans)

02:05.226 --> 02:07.228
BYE, TOMMY!

02:07.228 --> 02:09.560
THAT'S RIGHT.
I THREW HIM A "TOMMY,"

02:09.560 --> 02:12.703
BECAUSE YOU GUYS ARE TOO MEAN.
I MEAN, SURE,

02:12.703 --> 02:14.905
HE'S A LITTLE CREEPY,
BUT HE SEEMS HARMLESS.

02:14.905 --> 02:16.607
WHEN HE MURDERS YOU,

02:16.607 --> 02:19.210
THAT'S GONNA BE MY EXACT QUOTE
TO THE NEWS CREW.

02:19.210 --> 02:20.711
ANYONE SEEN MOM?

02:20.711 --> 02:22.213
(click)
HERE SHE IS.

02:22.213 --> 02:23.714
(click)
WHERE'D SHE GO?

02:23.714 --> 02:25.216
(click)
I'M RIGHT HERE!

02:25.216 --> 02:27.678
THAT'S... PLAYFUL.
(click)

02:27.678 --> 02:29.450
(groans)
(click)

02:29.450 --> 02:31.522
NO WAY! OH, MY GOSH!
OHH! OW! OW!

02:31.522 --> 02:34.225
CAN'T STAY HOLED UP
IN THE DARKNESS FOREVER.

02:34.225 --> 02:37.388
GET TOO PALE. LOOK, YOU CAN
KIND OF SEE THROUGH MY HAND.

02:37.388 --> 02:40.631
SO MAYBE YOU'RE THINKING
ABOUT HEADING BACK TO COLLEGE?

02:40.631 --> 02:44.835
OH, UH, YES. I'LL PROBABLY
HEAD BACK LATER TODAY.

02:44.835 --> 02:47.938
UHH! PARENTS!
PARENTS!

02:47.938 --> 02:50.871
OH, SO YOU PRACTICED
FOR THIS MOMENT?

02:50.871 --> 02:52.373
YES.(giggles, grunts)

02:52.373 --> 02:56.247
(both grunt) PARENTS!

02:56.247 --> 03:00.411
WHAT THE HELL? I DON'T WANT
TO HAVE TO SEE THIS EVERY DAY.

03:00.411 --> 03:02.783
REALLY?
RAINBOWS GET YOU RILED UP?

03:02.783 --> 03:05.216
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE DOING
GRAFFITI NEAR OUR HOUSES EITHER.

03:05.216 --> 03:08.219
OH, NOW IT'S GRAFFITI.
I SAW THE KIDS THAT DID IT.

03:08.219 --> 03:10.691
YEAH, I WOULD HAVE STOPPED THEM,
BUT THEY DIDN'T SEEM

03:10.691 --> 03:14.225
LIKE THE KIND OF KIDS
YOU WANT TO MESS WITH.
HOW OLD WERE THEY?

03:14.225 --> 03:16.767
THE BIG ONE WAS,
LIKE, UH... LIKE, 9.

03:16.767 --> 03:18.699
YOU HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE SEXY.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.201
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
HOW CREEPY THESE KIDS WERE.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.634
OKAY? IT WAS LIKE--LIKE
"CHILDREN OF THE CORN."

03:23.634 --> 03:27.738
I CROWN YOU
KING OF THE WUSSIES.

03:27.738 --> 03:28.879
WHAT?

03:28.879 --> 03:31.982
(dog barking in distance)

03:31.982 --> 03:33.614
(chorus) в™ЄDOMINUSв™Є

03:33.614 --> 03:35.646
THEY DON'T BLINK.
I FEEL COLD.

03:35.646 --> 03:37.688
TOLD YOU.

03:39.620 --> 03:42.993
ROGER, WE WORKED ON THIS.
YOU GET MORE OUT OF YOUR DRIVE

03:42.993 --> 03:46.297
IF YOU PLAY ANGRY.
LAURIE, LITTLE HELP.

03:46.297 --> 03:49.300
I'M GONNA TRICK YOUR SON
INTO PUTTING A BABY IN ME

03:49.300 --> 03:51.902
SO I GET ALL YOUR MONEY
WHEN YOU CROAK.

03:51.902 --> 03:55.436
NOW MAKE THE BALL HER FACE,
AND WHAT DO WE DO?

03:55.436 --> 03:57.668
I SMASH HERFACE!
(thwack)

03:57.668 --> 03:58.839
(cheers)
(laughs)

03:58.839 --> 04:00.911
AW, THAT'S A HUMDINGER.
THANKS, GUYS.

04:00.911 --> 04:03.314
YOU GOT IT, BUD.
NOW FINISH THAT BUCKET.

04:03.314 --> 04:05.846
WE GOT TO TALK BUSINESS
FOR A SEC.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.848
LAURIE, WE'RE NOT
WASTING OUR PROFITS

04:07.848 --> 04:10.881
BY MAKING "PENNY CAN"
SPORTSWEAR.
BUT MY DESIGNS ROCK. SERIOUSLY,

04:10.881 --> 04:13.384
ANDY'S WEARING THE BIKE SHORTS
UNDER HIS PANTS TODAY.

04:13.384 --> 04:16.787
THEY HUG THE AREA BUT STILL
MANAGE TO LET IT BREATHE.

04:16.787 --> 04:17.958
HMM.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.460
I SMASH HERFACE!
(thwack)

04:19.460 --> 04:21.892
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU GUYS

04:21.892 --> 04:24.395
ARE STILL WASTING YOUR TIME
TALKING ABOUT THAT GAME.

04:24.395 --> 04:27.638
YOU MIGHT AS WELL JUST
THROW YOUR MONEY IN A HOLE.

04:27.638 --> 04:29.400
ACTUALLY, THATISTHE GAME.

04:29.400 --> 04:32.803
WELL, THAT ISRIDICULOUS.

04:32.803 --> 04:34.004
(whistles)

04:36.006 --> 04:37.378
(rattle)

04:37.378 --> 04:38.949
(high-pitched voices)
PENNY CAN!

04:38.949 --> 04:42.282
HA! MY COMPANY NEEDS
TO BUY THIS. (laughs)

04:42.282 --> 04:45.986
WHAT A GREAT DAY. MAN, THIS
CALLS FOR SOME CELEBRATION WINE.

04:45.986 --> 04:49.890
OH, SORRY. THIS IS ALSO MY
THERE'S-NOTHING-GOOD-ON-TV WINE.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.393
DOESN'T MATTER. YOU AND LAURIE
ARE SELLING PENNY CANS,

04:52.393 --> 04:54.695
AND WE GOT TRAV
BACK OUT THERE.

04:54.695 --> 04:57.828
THERE HE IS. HE'S BACK, FOLKS.
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

04:57.828 --> 05:00.901
LIKE I'M ON ONE OF THOSE
COMMERCIALS WHERE THE SAD LADY

05:00.901 --> 05:02.903
TAKES HAPPY PILLS,
STARTS PLAYING TENNIS AGAIN.

05:02.903 --> 05:05.606
(doorbell rings)
ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS
WAS ON THAT DRUG...

05:05.606 --> 05:07.978
(singsongy) BUT I CAN'T
TELL YOU WHO IT WAS.
(door opens)

05:07.978 --> 05:10.080
IT WAS ELLIE.
WHAT WAS ELLIE?

05:10.080 --> 05:12.713
HEY, KEV. NICE TO SEE YOU.
YOU HERE TO GIVE TRAV

05:12.713 --> 05:15.916
A RIDE BACK TO SCHOOL?
NO, I CAME TO CHECK ON HIM. HE
HASN'T BEEN AT SCHOOL IN WEEKS.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.648
WELL, IT'S SPRING BREAK.

05:17.648 --> 05:20.751
SPRING BREAK
WAS LAST MONTH.

05:20.751 --> 05:23.053
DID TRAV
DROP OUT OF SCHOOL?

05:25.095 --> 05:30.030
в™Єв™Єв™Є

05:35.966 --> 05:38.509
YOU STOPPED GOING TO COLLEGE?

05:38.509 --> 05:40.771
(door closes)
(gasps) OH, FUN.
I LOVE A GOOD BEAT DOWN.

05:40.771 --> 05:42.913
MOM, I'M SORRY, OKAY?
I JUST...

05:42.913 --> 05:45.345
LOOK, I'M LOST RIGHT NOW.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.747
COME HERE.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.950
NO. NO "COME HERE."
HE'S PLAYING YOU.

05:49.950 --> 05:53.083
I'M NOT PLAYING YOU, OKAY?
I JUST...

05:53.083 --> 05:56.587
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT
A LOT LATELY, AND, UH, MAYBE...

05:56.587 --> 05:59.390
COLLEGE ISN'T RIGHT FOR ME.

05:59.390 --> 06:01.932
YOU'RE GIVING UP YOUR FUTURE.

06:01.932 --> 06:05.996
HOW LONG DID YOU
LAST IN COLLEGE?
SIX WEEKS.
HE'S RIGHT. I'M OUT.

06:05.996 --> 06:09.940
I PAID YOUR TUITION.
DO YOU KNOW HOW USED I FEEL?

06:09.940 --> 06:12.643
IT'S LIKE WHEN
YOU HOOK UP WITH A DUDE,

06:12.643 --> 06:15.646
AND THEN YOU WAKE UP
THE NEXT MORNING, AND HE'S GONE,

06:15.646 --> 06:17.948
AND THERE'S JUST A NOTE
ON YOUR PILLOW, THAT SAYS,

06:17.948 --> 06:21.051
"LAST NIGHT WAS FUN. CALL ME
NEXT TIME YOU'RE IN TAMPA,"

06:21.051 --> 06:24.054
AND YOU'RE LIKE,
"WHAT?I'M IN TAMPA?"
ALL RIGHT,
YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES.

06:24.054 --> 06:26.917
YOU EITHER GO BACK TO COLLEGE,
OR YOU MOVE OUT AND GET A JOB.

06:26.917 --> 06:29.420
WELL, I THINK
I'M JUST GONNA STAY HERE

06:29.420 --> 06:32.423
TILL I GET MY HEAD STRAIGHT.
NOT ONE OF THE CHOICES.

06:32.423 --> 06:35.566
IT'S TIME FOR TOUGH LOVE, BUDDY.
I WILL TOSS YOU OUT ON YOUR ASS.

06:35.566 --> 06:38.769
MOM, THAT'S NOT YOU.
OH, IT'S ME. I TOSS ASSES.

06:38.769 --> 06:42.002
(laughs)
(crinkles)

06:42.002 --> 06:45.506
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I'M GOING TO
EAT SOME CHIPS.

06:45.506 --> 06:47.708
PUT THOSE DOWN.

06:47.708 --> 06:49.940
THEY'RE STALE.
HERE, HAVE A FRESH BAG.

06:49.940 --> 06:52.783
TRAV 1, JULES 0.

06:54.645 --> 06:58.148
MAN, I'M NERVOUS. CAN'T QUIT
CHEWING MY FINGERNAILS.

06:58.148 --> 07:01.652
AAH! THIS ONE'S POINTY
LIKE A WITCH'S NAIL.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.654
(sighs) THIS IS
A BUSINESS MEETING.

07:03.654 --> 07:06.126
BE PROFESSIONAL, OKAY?

07:06.126 --> 07:09.560
(laughs)

07:09.560 --> 07:10.661
FINE.

07:10.661 --> 07:12.963
(sighs) I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HERE WITH ME, ANDY.

07:12.963 --> 07:16.436
YOU ALWAYS GOT MY BACK,
AND THAT'S WHY I LOVE YA.

07:16.436 --> 07:19.439
(voice breaking) DON'T MAKE ME
CRY BEFORE THIS MEETING, OKAY?

07:19.439 --> 07:20.941
(Roger speaks indistinctly
in distance)

07:20.941 --> 07:23.443
ALL RIGHT. REMEMBER, DON'T
FALL FOR ANY RAZZLE-DAZZLE.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.515
(door opens)

07:24.515 --> 07:27.017
HEY, GANG.
I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU

07:27.017 --> 07:30.851
TO THE NEW SPOKESPERSON
FOR PENNY CAN...

07:30.851 --> 07:34.084
MR. LOU DIAMOND PHILLIPS.

07:34.084 --> 07:35.225
NO WAY!

07:35.225 --> 07:36.487
WAY.

07:36.487 --> 07:37.958
PERFECT.

07:39.990 --> 07:42.462
WELL, YOU SHOULD BE SPRAYING IT
FROM THE OTHER SIDE

07:42.462 --> 07:44.595
TO PUSH IT ALL
TOWARDS THE CURB.

07:44.595 --> 07:47.838
ARE YOU REALLY
TELLING ME HOW TO HOSE?
I AM.

07:47.838 --> 07:49.840
GOD, I WISH I COULD BE ANDY.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.972
I WOULDN'T DO THAT
IF I WERE YOU.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.043
WHY?

07:53.043 --> 07:54.745
(whispers) COME HERE.

07:54.745 --> 07:58.909
CHALK CHILDREN AREN'T LIKE
OTHER KIDS. THEY'RE DARK--

07:58.909 --> 08:02.553
WELL, NOT PHYSICALLY,
BUT... EMOTIONLESS...

08:02.553 --> 08:04.815
(whispers)
THEY'RE HOME-SCHOOLED.

08:04.815 --> 08:05.916
(gasps)

08:05.916 --> 08:07.918
WHEN MY WIFE JOANNE
WAS ALIVE,

08:07.918 --> 08:10.721
THEY CHALKED MY DRIVEWAY,
AND I HOSED IT OFF.

08:10.721 --> 08:13.063
THEN BAD THINGS
STARTED HAPPENING.

08:13.063 --> 08:16.196
BRANCHES FALLING,
WINDOWS BREAKING...

08:16.196 --> 08:17.928
CHINS DISAPPEARING.

08:17.928 --> 08:19.169
(laughs)

08:19.169 --> 08:21.802
YOU MOCK, BUT KNOW THIS--

08:21.802 --> 08:25.676
CHALK CHILDREN DON'T FORGIVE,

08:25.676 --> 08:27.678
AND THEY NEVER FORGET.

08:27.678 --> 08:29.610
OHH.

08:29.610 --> 08:32.242
(chorus sings in Latin)

08:32.242 --> 08:34.715
(gasps)

08:34.715 --> 08:36.717
(whispers)
THAT ONE'S THE LEADER.

08:36.717 --> 08:40.090
OKAY. IF YOU'RE STAYING HERE,
I'LL GIVE YOU A DEAL ON RENT.

08:40.090 --> 08:42.653
BUT I'M ADDING
YOUR FIRST YEAR OF COLLEGE,

08:42.653 --> 08:45.726
SO YOU'RE GONNA NEED
TO GIVEME$11,270.

08:45.726 --> 08:48.729
YOU KNOW WHAT SUCKS? IS THAT
WHEN YOUR LIFE FALLS APART

08:48.729 --> 08:51.932
AND YOU GET LET DOWN BY THE ONE
PERSON YOU COUNT ON MOST.

08:51.932 --> 08:54.004
IS THAT ME?
YEAH.

08:54.004 --> 08:56.006
(whispers) YES.

08:56.006 --> 08:58.869
I JUST NEED A BREAK.

08:58.869 --> 09:00.941
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

09:00.941 --> 09:03.944
AND YOU'D COME TO SCHOOL AND LIE
ABOUT SOME AUNT OR UNCLE DYING,

09:03.944 --> 09:06.176
AND THEN WE'D GO
TO THE BEACH?

09:06.176 --> 09:09.119
(chuckles) OH, SWEETIE...
THOSE PEOPLE ACTUALLY DIED.

09:09.119 --> 09:11.822
HOW COME WE DIDN'T
GO TO THE FUNERALS?

09:11.822 --> 09:13.654
BECAUSETHEY'RE
SO DEPRESSING.

09:13.654 --> 09:15.155
SOLID PARENTING.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.157
STILL, I JUST LOVED
OUR BEACH DAYS.

09:17.157 --> 09:20.260
IT WAS LIKE I DIDN'T HAVE
A CARE IN THE WORLD AND...

09:20.260 --> 09:22.963
CAN'T WE DO THAT AGAIN?

09:22.963 --> 09:26.066
NO. I TOLD EVERYONE
I WAS GONNA DO TOUGH LOVE.

09:26.066 --> 09:29.069
MOM,
THEY DON'T HAVE TO KNOW.

09:29.069 --> 09:32.072
в™Єв™Єв™Є

09:57.668 --> 10:00.200
SO IT'S GONNA BE
THE LOU DIAMOND PHILLIPS

10:00.200 --> 10:02.773
OFFICIAL BOBBY COBB'S
PENNY CAN CAN?

10:02.773 --> 10:05.105
THAT WOULD BE
FAR TOO MANY NAMES.

10:05.105 --> 10:09.039
OH, SO IT'S GONNA STAY
BOBBY COBB'S PENNY CAN?
HE'S NOT GETTING IT.

10:09.039 --> 10:10.681
NO.

10:10.681 --> 10:13.814
IS THERE SOMETHING ON MY FACE?

10:13.814 --> 10:16.346
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOUR RACE IS,

10:16.346 --> 10:21.151
BUT I AM INTO IT
IN A BIG WAY.

10:21.151 --> 10:22.653
ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

10:22.653 --> 10:25.696
CHECK OUT THIS PROTOTYPE
THAT MY NERDS HERE PUT TOGETHER.

10:25.696 --> 10:29.930
IT EVEN TALKS TO YOU
WHEN YOU MAKE A SHOT. BOOM! AAH!
(clatter)

10:29.930 --> 10:32.302
(Lou Diamond Phillips) HEY,
THIS IS LOU DIAMOND PHILLIPS

10:32.302 --> 10:34.104
SAYING, "PENNY CAN."
(whirring)

10:34.104 --> 10:36.336
I KNOCKED THAT OUT
IN ONE TAKE.

10:36.336 --> 10:40.811
THIS ISN'T THE GAME. I MEAN,
THERE'S NO LIGHTS OR SPINNING.

10:40.811 --> 10:43.213
AND THE PEOPLE
ARE SUPPOSED TO SING...

10:43.213 --> 10:44.775
(high-pitched voices) PENNY CAN!

10:44.775 --> 10:48.719
I LIKE IT.
IT'S SHINY AND IT MOVES.

10:48.719 --> 10:50.220
THE RULES ARE DIFFERENT.

10:50.220 --> 10:53.223
I MEAN, THERE'S NO DANCING,
THERE'S NO 'STACHE ATTACK...

10:53.223 --> 10:56.026
YOU TOOK OUT THE EAR FLICK.

10:56.026 --> 10:59.129
WELL, MY OTHER NERDS THOUGHT
IT WAS A LIABILITY ISSUE.

10:59.129 --> 11:01.061
OH, PLEASE.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.432
(thwack)
(grunts, groans)

11:02.432 --> 11:05.135
OOH. DID I GET YOU
WITH MY WITCH NAIL?

11:05.135 --> 11:07.738
NO, NO, NO, NO. WE SHOULD
KEEP THIS MOVING, THOUGH.
RIGHT.

11:07.738 --> 11:10.070
DID YOU SEE THIS PART HERE
OF THE CONTRACT, BOBBY?

11:10.070 --> 11:12.442
(gasps) OH, GOD.

11:12.442 --> 11:16.076
THAT WAS AN EVEN BETTER BEACH
DAY THAN WHEN UNCLE DUSTY DIED.

11:16.076 --> 11:20.010
AND TO CAP IT ALL OFF...
EMILIO ESTГ©VEZ MOVIE MARATHON.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.882
MY FIRST ESTГ©VEZ FESTEVEZ.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.184
AND WE'RE NOT STOPPING
AT HIS ON-CAMERA WORK, EITHER.

11:24.184 --> 11:27.718
GUESS WHO DIRECTED
TWO EPISODES OF"COLD CASE"?
SHUT UP.

11:27.718 --> 11:30.791
YEAH. HEY, IT'S COOL
IF I FALL ASLEEP IN HERE, RIGHT?

11:30.791 --> 11:34.224
DID UNCLE DUSTY THROW
HIMSELF OFF A BRIDGE?
DID HE?

11:34.224 --> 11:37.097
(crunches) NO.

11:38.368 --> 11:41.071
ARE THOSE ALL OUR HOUSES?

11:41.071 --> 11:44.404
AND THAT'S US, THERE...
BURNING ALIVE.

11:44.404 --> 11:48.208
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A HEAD.
NO, WAIT, THERE IT IS.

11:48.208 --> 11:51.211
WHY IS MY SEVERED HEAD
STILL SCREAMING?

11:51.211 --> 11:53.113
BECAUSE THEY DRAW
WHAT THEY DREAM.

11:53.113 --> 11:56.817
OH, MAN. HERE THEY COME.
WHAT NOW?

11:56.817 --> 11:59.089
WE MAKE THEM A PEACE OFFERING--
NEW CHALK, MAYBE A SCOOTER.

11:59.089 --> 12:01.852
JUST BE COOL,
JUST BE COOL.
HEY, KIDS.

12:01.852 --> 12:04.154
(chuckles)
NEAT PICTURE.

12:04.154 --> 12:06.196
(gasps)

12:06.196 --> 12:09.159
YOU FOOL. YOU'VE KILLED US ALL.

12:09.159 --> 12:12.202
(chorus singing in Latin)

12:12.202 --> 12:13.804
(gasps)

12:13.804 --> 12:17.107
в™Єв™Єв™Є

12:17.107 --> 12:20.110
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS...
SIGN THESE CONTRACTS.

12:20.110 --> 12:24.314
THIS FEELS WRONG, MAN. YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE RUINING PENNY CAN.

12:24.314 --> 12:27.277
I HATE IT WHEN BIG BUSINESS
GETS THEIR HOOKS INTO SOMETHING.

12:27.277 --> 12:28.849
LOOK AT "YOUNG GUNS II."

12:28.849 --> 12:31.181
IT'S LIKE, "HEY,
LET'S TAKE EVERYTHING AWESOME

12:31.181 --> 12:34.184
ABOUT THE FIRST MOVIE AND PUKE
BON JOVI ALL OVER IT." TRAVESTY.

12:34.184 --> 12:36.957
I'M SORRY, GUYS.
I CAN'T SIGN.

12:36.957 --> 12:39.790
I AM 100% NOT INTO THIS.

12:39.790 --> 12:42.863
WELL, I AM ONE ZILLION PERCENT
FOR IT.

12:42.863 --> 12:45.165
INFINITY!
INFINITY!

12:45.165 --> 12:50.370
DAMN, TIE. GO AHEAD
AND BREAK THE TIE, BUDDY.

12:50.370 --> 12:53.904
(sighs) SORRY, MAN,
BUT... YOU GUYS SPLIT 40 GRAND

12:53.904 --> 12:57.207
PLUS A SHARE OF THE PROFITS?
YOU GOT TO SELL.

12:57.207 --> 12:59.779
(scoffs)

13:02.382 --> 13:06.516
(Laurie) HEY, LADY, ARE YOU
DECENT? I'M BRINGING YOU COFFEE.

13:06.516 --> 13:08.518
OH, THANKS.
HAVE YOU SEEN TRAV?

13:08.518 --> 13:11.261
HE SAID HE WAS GONNA
CRASH IN HERE.

13:11.261 --> 13:13.563
WEIRD.
HEY, WHAT'S WITH THE NOTE?

13:13.563 --> 13:15.966
LET'S SEE. OHH.

13:15.966 --> 13:19.369
"THANKS.
LAST NIGHT WAS FUN"?

13:19.369 --> 13:22.432
DID YOU JUST GET ONE-NIGHT
STANDED BY YOUR OWN SON?

13:22.432 --> 13:24.434
HE SAID WE WERE
GOING TO BRUNCH.

13:24.434 --> 13:26.436
OH, NO.

13:35.015 --> 13:37.317
YOU SPEND A NIGHT
LIKE THAT WITH SOMEONE,

13:37.317 --> 13:39.249
AND YOU THINK
IT MEANS SOMETHING.

13:39.249 --> 13:40.250
ME?

13:40.250 --> 13:41.351
TRAVIS.

13:41.351 --> 13:43.523
GOOD... I THINK.

13:43.523 --> 13:46.256
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE PLAYED ME.

13:46.256 --> 13:48.398
SHOCKER--YOUR SON IS
AS MANIPULATIVE AS YOU ARE.

13:48.398 --> 13:50.100
YOU MUST BE SO PROUD.

13:50.100 --> 13:52.402
MAYBE I WENT EASY ON HIM
BECAUSE DEEP DOWN,

13:52.402 --> 13:55.405
I KNOW THAT HE NEEDS ME
TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

13:55.405 --> 13:58.368
WHAT DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO?
LIVE HERE UNTIL HE'S 60

13:58.368 --> 14:02.112
SO YOU TWO CAN SPEND EVERY
SECOND OF YOUR LIVES TOGETHER?
OH, MY GOD.
THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.

14:02.112 --> 14:04.975
PUSHED THE WRONG BUTTON THERE.

14:04.975 --> 14:07.277
YOU HAVE TO CRUSH HIM.
YOU'RE JUST SCARED.

14:07.277 --> 14:11.151
PRACTICE WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND.
GRAYSON, GET YOUR TRAVIS ON.

14:11.151 --> 14:12.953
(imitating Travis) MOM...

14:12.953 --> 14:16.987
DON'T MAKE ME LEAVE.
I'M JUST SO LOST RIGHT NOW.

14:18.188 --> 14:19.529
GO.

14:19.529 --> 14:22.132
I'M ONLY DOING THIS
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU.

14:22.132 --> 14:24.064
I LOVE YOU, TOO...

14:24.064 --> 14:26.036
SO MUCH.

14:37.607 --> 14:41.311
SHOULD WE ALL
JUST WALK AWAY?
MM-HMM. I'M GONNA GO.

14:41.311 --> 14:43.313
(indistinct conversations,
horn honks in distance)

14:43.313 --> 14:46.216
HEY, GUYS, I'VE BEEN
LOOKING ALL OVER FOR YOU.

14:46.216 --> 14:49.019
REALLY? BECAUSE IF YOU HAD
SIGNED THE CONTRACT,

14:49.019 --> 14:51.291
YOU COULD HAVE SPOTTED US
FROM YOUR HELICOPTER

14:51.291 --> 14:54.524
AND THROWN HANDFULS OF GOLD
ON US TO GET OUR ATTENTION.

14:54.524 --> 14:57.067
I'M NOT SURE YOU KNOW
HOW FAR $20,000 GOES.

14:57.067 --> 14:59.329
(chuckles) DIDN'T SAY
IT WAS A NEW HELICOPTER.

14:59.329 --> 15:01.071
OH, MY BAD.

15:01.071 --> 15:03.373
LOOK, I CAME HERE
FOR TWO THINGS--NUMBER ONE,

15:03.373 --> 15:06.036
TO RETURN THE IMAGINARY KNIFE...
(pops lips)

15:06.036 --> 15:08.608
THAT YOU STABBED ME
IN THE BACK WITH.
NOT MINE.

15:08.608 --> 15:12.082
YOUR INITIALS ARE CARVED
RIGHT HERE IN THE HANDLE.
SOMEONE ELSE DID IT.

15:12.082 --> 15:14.514
JUST TAKE IT.
YOU GRABBED IT BY THE BLADE.

15:14.514 --> 15:15.615
OW!

15:15.615 --> 15:17.917
GUY FIGHTS AREWEIRD.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.220
LOOK, I KNOW PENNY CAN
IS JUST A SILLY GAME.

15:20.220 --> 15:22.922
STILL, I'M THE KIND OF GUY
THAT'S NOT GONNA GET

15:22.922 --> 15:25.555
TOO MANY CHANCES TO MAKE
HIS MARK ON THE WORLD.

15:25.555 --> 15:28.458
I THOUGHT PENNY CAN
WAS GONNA BE MY THING.

15:28.458 --> 15:30.400
BUT WE VOTED,
AND I LOST, SO...

15:30.400 --> 15:34.364
I'LL SIGN THE CONTRACT.

15:34.364 --> 15:36.536
(pen thuds)
YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT.

15:36.536 --> 15:40.270
I FEEL AWESOME AND TERRIBLE
AT THE SAME TIME.

15:40.270 --> 15:42.272
STOP IT WITH THE HAND.

15:42.272 --> 15:44.274
IT'S GONNA LEAVE A SCAR.
AI-YI-YI.

15:44.274 --> 15:47.947
I DON'T THINK RECREATING THEIR
DRAWINGS WILL APPEASE THEM.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.250
WE DON'T HAVE A LOT
OF OPTIONS RIGHT NOW, TOM.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.252
I DON'T LIKE DRAWING MYSELF
BURNING ALIVE.

15:52.252 --> 15:54.254
WELL, YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE DRAWING ME.

15:54.254 --> 15:56.956
OH, I'M COOL WITH THAT.

15:56.956 --> 15:59.589
YOU KNOW
WHAT'S ANNOYING, TOM?
ME?

15:59.589 --> 16:01.591
DON'T STEAL MY JOKES,
BUT YES.

16:01.591 --> 16:05.165
WHY WOULD YOU
HOSE OFF THE PICTURE?
I DON'T KNOW.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.168
I GUESS I ENJOYED THE THREE
OF US BEING A TEAM SO MUCH,

16:08.168 --> 16:11.171
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO END.
LOOK, I KNOW I SHOULDN'T TRY

16:11.171 --> 16:14.204
TO PUSH MY WAY INTO THE GROUP.
IT'S JUST, YOU GUYS SEEM SO FUN.

16:14.204 --> 16:16.006
I'M HORRIBLE
AT MAKING FRIENDS.

16:16.006 --> 16:18.648
JOANNE WAS THE ONE
THAT HANDLED IT FOR US,

16:18.648 --> 16:21.081
AND EVER SINCE SHE DIED,

16:21.081 --> 16:23.613
I GUESS I'VE JUST
BEEN SO LONELY.

16:23.613 --> 16:26.686
ANYWAY, I-I'M SORRY.

16:26.686 --> 16:28.688
WELL...

16:28.688 --> 16:32.292
DOWNER-VILLE, POPULATION HIM.

16:32.292 --> 16:34.494
(chuckles)

16:34.494 --> 16:36.626
WHAT UP, GIRLFRIEND?

16:36.626 --> 16:40.030
DON'T CALL ME THAT.
IT MAKES ME FEEL DIRTY NOW.

16:40.030 --> 16:42.302
DO YOU PREFERMAMACITA?

16:42.302 --> 16:45.305
IS THIS REALLY THE WAY
YOU WANT TO LIVE YOUR LIFE?

16:45.305 --> 16:48.438
IT'S NOON AND YOU'RE
STILL IN YOUR PAJAMAS.
YOU'RE STILL
IN YOUR PAJAMAS.

16:48.438 --> 16:50.710
NO, THIS IS COMFORTABLE...

16:50.710 --> 16:53.213
SPORTSWEAR
FOR ACTIVE OLDER PEOPLE.

16:53.213 --> 16:54.284
(sighs)

16:54.284 --> 16:57.287
(sighs) TRAVIS, I LOVE YOU.

16:57.287 --> 16:59.219
(Spanish accent)
I LOVE YOU, TOO,MAMACITA.

16:59.219 --> 17:03.153
REMEMBER THAT... BECAUSE I'M
KICKING YOU OUT OF THE HOUSE.

17:03.153 --> 17:04.754
SOMEBODY'S MAD.

17:04.754 --> 17:06.556
IT'S FOR REAL THIS TIME.

17:06.556 --> 17:09.599
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
YOU DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL.

17:09.599 --> 17:12.602
I'M SO DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

17:12.602 --> 17:16.306
BUT THIS IS WHAT'S
RIGHT FOR ME RIGHT N--
NO, IT'S NOT.

17:16.306 --> 17:18.808
YOU GOT HURT AND YOU MADE
A SCARED, LAZY DECISION.

17:18.808 --> 17:22.242
AND I'M NOT GONNA JUST SIT HERE
AND SUPPORT YOU. I WON'T.

17:22.242 --> 17:26.116
SO EITHER YOU GO BACK
TO COLLEGE AND I WILL PAY...

17:26.116 --> 17:28.648
OTHERWISE, YOU'VE GOT
TO GO START YOUR LIFE.

17:28.648 --> 17:31.321
EITHER WAY, YOU HAVE
UNTIL TOMORROW MORNING

17:31.321 --> 17:34.654
TO GET OUT OF MY HOUSE.

17:38.788 --> 17:40.530
(chorus) в™ЄDOMINUSв™Є

17:40.530 --> 17:42.392
DAMN IT,
WE AREN'T FINISHED YET.

17:42.392 --> 17:45.095
THERE'S NO TIME.
WE GOT TO GO AT THEM.

17:45.095 --> 17:48.138
THEY WANT TO LAY THE CREEPY
ON US? WE GO EVEN CREEPIER.

17:48.138 --> 17:50.140
I'M GONNA CHANNEL
VINCENT D'ONOFRIO FROM

17:50.140 --> 17:53.343
"FULL METAL JACKET." YOU DO,
LIKE, UH, HELENA BONHAM CARTER.

17:53.343 --> 17:55.605
(British accent)
ONE STEP AHEAD OF YOU, DEARIE.
(gasps)

17:55.605 --> 17:58.378
THAT'S AWFUL, TOM.
WHO ARE YOU DOING?

17:58.378 --> 18:00.350
OH, THAT'S JUST
MY THINKING FACE.

18:00.350 --> 18:03.183
AH, HERE THEY COME.

18:13.463 --> 18:14.464
YES!

18:14.464 --> 18:18.328
WAY TO GO!
WE SCARED SOME KIDS.

18:18.328 --> 18:20.500
COFFEE?
YEAH.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.832
COME ON, TOM. COFFEE.

18:22.832 --> 18:26.206
OH, OKAY. (whispers) YES.

18:27.707 --> 18:28.708
(clatter)

18:28.708 --> 18:30.640
HEY, PARTNER.

18:30.640 --> 18:32.342
HOW YOU DOING?

18:32.342 --> 18:33.343
(clatter)

18:33.343 --> 18:34.644
NOT GREAT.

18:36.786 --> 18:38.188
(rattle)

18:38.188 --> 18:40.850
(all, high-pitched voices)
PENNY CAN.

18:40.850 --> 18:42.352
LOOK, YOU'RE BOBBY COBB.

18:42.352 --> 18:45.695
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A TON
OF CHANCES TO MAKE YOUR MARK.

18:45.695 --> 18:48.398
(clatter)
YEAH, AND EVEN THOUGH
IT WOULD BECRAZYFOR YOU

18:48.398 --> 18:51.401
TO TURN DOWN THIS MONEY, OUR
FRIENDSHIP IS MORE IMPORTANT,

18:51.401 --> 18:55.665
AND IF YOU DON'T WANT
TO SELL IT, WE WON'T SELL IT.
I DON'T WANT TO SELL IT.

18:55.665 --> 18:58.168
WE ALREADY SOLD IT.
WHY WOULD YOU LIE?

18:58.168 --> 19:01.811
BECAUSE WE ASKED ROGER FOR MORE
TIME AND HE SAID NOW OR NEVER.

19:01.811 --> 19:04.314
LOOK, I PROMISED
TO ALWAYS HAVE YOUR BACK.

19:04.314 --> 19:06.316
THIS IS ME HAVING YOUR BACK.

19:06.316 --> 19:10.480
THAT CHECK GETS YOU OFF
YOUR BOAT AND INTO AN APARTMENT.

19:10.480 --> 19:13.183
IT'S THE FRESH START
I'VE DREAMED ABOUT FOR US.

19:13.183 --> 19:14.184
MNH-MNH.

19:14.184 --> 19:15.585

19:15.585 --> 19:16.826
OKAY.

19:16.826 --> 19:19.158
BEHOLD...

19:25.395 --> 19:27.467
LOOK AT THAT PIECE OF JUNK.

19:27.467 --> 19:30.740

19:30.740 --> 19:33.603
IT CLIMBS WALLS? NO WAY.

19:33.603 --> 19:36.276
IT ALSO SAYS THAT
WHENEVER YOU SAY, "WAY."

AND LOOK WHAT WE MADE 'EM
PUT ON THE INSIDE.

19:38.748 --> 19:42.352
"INVENTED BY BOBBY COBB."

19:42.352 --> 19:43.653
NO WAY!

19:43.653 --> 19:45.455
HA! THIS IS AWESOME!

19:45.455 --> 19:47.457
FRIENDS AGAIN?
OH, WE'RE MORE THAN FRIENDS.

19:47.457 --> 19:49.959
