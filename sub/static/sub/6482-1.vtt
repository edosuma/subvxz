00:33.900 --> 00:38.769
<i>The oldest stories ever told
are written in the stars.</i>

00:40.173 --> 00:45.941
<i>Stories of time before man and gods,
when Titans ruled the earth.</i>

00:46.913 --> 00:48.540
<i>The Titans were powerful...</i>

00:48.715 --> 00:51.741
<i>...but their reign was ended
by their own sons...</i>

00:51.918 --> 00:56.912
<i>...Zeus, Poseidon and Hades.</i>

00:58.725 --> 01:00.522
<i>Zeus convinced his brother Hades...</i>

01:00.693 --> 01:04.629
<i>...to create a beast so strong
it could defeat their parents.</i>

01:04.798 --> 01:06.663
<i>And from his own flesh...</i>

01:06.833 --> 01:11.236
<i>...Hades gave birth
to an unspeakable horror...</i>

01:11.404 --> 01:13.304
<i>...the Kraken.</i>

01:20.046 --> 01:23.573
<i>Zeus became king of the heavens.</i>

01:24.384 --> 01:27.820
<i>Poseidon, king of the seas.</i>

01:28.455 --> 01:31.356
<i>And Hades, tricked by Zeus...</i>

01:31.524 --> 01:36.791
<i>...was left to rule the underworld
in darkness and in misery.</i>

01:38.832 --> 01:41.300
<i>It was Zeus who created man...</i>

01:41.468 --> 01:45.632
<i>...and man's prayers
fed the gods' immortality.</i>

01:48.875 --> 01:52.868
<i>But in time, mankind grew restless.</i>

01:53.046 --> 01:55.173
<i>They began to question the gods...</i>

01:55.348 --> 01:59.409
<i>...and, finally, rise up against them.</i>

02:05.792 --> 02:09.353
<i>Into this world, a child was born.</i>

02:10.295 --> 02:13.060
<i>A boy who would change everything.</i>

02:44.230 --> 02:46.027
Shh. Shh.

02:50.270 --> 02:52.170
Perseus.

03:23.469 --> 03:25.300
What is it, son?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.064
I'll have a brother or a sister soon.

03:30.143 --> 03:34.375
Think we're gonna love this child differently
to the way we love you? We won't.

03:35.682 --> 03:37.707
This child will be yours.

03:37.884 --> 03:39.545
Me...

03:40.220 --> 03:41.414
...I'm no one's son.

03:41.955 --> 03:45.015
I am your father, Perseus.
Marmara is your mother.

03:45.191 --> 03:48.957
And you'll always be our son.

03:49.729 --> 03:53.893
The bond between us
is much more than flesh and bone.

03:54.334 --> 03:55.961
The love we have for you...

03:56.135 --> 04:01.038
...it's that love that gods and kings
fight over.

04:01.774 --> 04:03.571
I've never understood the gods.

04:03.743 --> 04:06.576
But even I don't question
that you were saved for a reason.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.010
And some day...

04:09.182 --> 04:14.347
...that reason is gonna take you
far away from here.

04:15.688 --> 04:16.848
But not tonight, eh?

04:37.577 --> 04:40.011
Perseus. Perseus!

04:40.179 --> 04:42.374
Getting frail, old man.

04:42.548 --> 04:45.142
Marmara! Marmara!

04:49.756 --> 04:53.283
Another day, nothing.

04:53.960 --> 04:56.019
Caught on the reef.

04:56.195 --> 04:59.596
To whom do I direct our gratitude
for this glorious bounty?

04:59.766 --> 05:01.028
Spyros, please.

05:01.200 --> 05:04.465
Poseidon, Zeus?
Who do I thank, Marmara?

05:04.637 --> 05:07.470
- Thank the men who provoke them.
They crush my island.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.737
They put a plague on yours.

05:09.909 --> 05:12.469
They take from us what they want.
We're their slaves.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.078
The gods gave us life.

05:14.514 --> 05:18.848
- For that, we should be thankful.
- I'm tired of being thankful for scraps.

05:19.018 --> 05:21.543
I'm a fisherman. Perseus is a fisherman.

05:21.721 --> 05:25.020
They've even taken that away from us.
What we are.

05:25.525 --> 05:27.493
Still they want us to love them anyway.

05:28.561 --> 05:29.823
One day...

05:29.996 --> 05:32.464
...somebody's gonna have to
make a stand.

05:32.632 --> 05:34.964
One day, somebody's gonna have to say:

05:35.134 --> 05:36.396
"Enough."

06:07.800 --> 06:10.428
Just like the day you came to me.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.634
The storm brought me right to you.

06:22.415 --> 06:24.042
I know you have questions, son.

06:24.684 --> 06:27.016
I wish I had the answers.

06:31.924 --> 06:33.551
I have everything I need...

06:34.093 --> 06:35.583
...right here.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.794
Good night, son.

06:58.584 --> 07:00.643
Hold her steady!

07:01.087 --> 07:02.577
Tekla, the wreath.

07:02.755 --> 07:04.279
Fetch the wreath.

07:04.457 --> 07:07.449
The statue of Zeus. Magnificent.

07:21.307 --> 07:22.365
Something isn't right.

07:23.743 --> 07:26.234
The soldiers, what are they doing?

07:30.783 --> 07:31.807
Come on!

07:31.984 --> 07:33.508
Lift it!

07:36.456 --> 07:37.821
Hang on!

07:44.230 --> 07:46.494
In the name of the king and queen!

07:47.633 --> 07:48.657
Who are they?

07:48.835 --> 07:50.735
Soldiers from Argos.

07:51.370 --> 07:53.429
What have they done?

07:53.606 --> 07:57.064
They've declared war.
War against the gods.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.427
- Let's turn the boat around.
No.

08:21.601 --> 08:23.034
Do nothing.

08:27.874 --> 08:29.808
Behind you!

08:51.864 --> 08:53.388
Hold on!

08:59.872 --> 09:01.032
Tekla.

09:01.207 --> 09:02.299
Where's the boy?

09:08.414 --> 09:10.143
Tekla!

09:35.741 --> 09:38.141
No!

09:39.912 --> 09:42.005
Go!
- No!

10:03.970 --> 10:06.438
No!

10:08.874 --> 10:13.106
<i>Zeus, you must bring an end
to this. They attack our temples!</i>

10:13.279 --> 10:15.907
<i>Now they dare to desecrate Zeus' image.</i>

10:16.082 --> 10:17.379
<i>We could reach out to them.</i>

10:17.550 --> 10:19.177
<i>An accommodation could be made.
A truce!</i>

10:19.352 --> 10:21.149
No!

10:25.591 --> 10:27.616
I created them...

10:27.793 --> 10:31.854
...and they reward my love with defiance?

10:32.031 --> 10:34.329
There will be no truce.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.463
Finally.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.570
Some rage from you.

10:42.508 --> 10:43.873
How long has it been?

10:44.710 --> 10:46.234
How long, brother...

10:46.412 --> 10:49.210
...since you've seen my face?

10:50.216 --> 10:51.478
Hades.

10:57.857 --> 11:03.420
Endless years,
I've watched from the underworld...

11:03.829 --> 11:08.789
...and saw your wrath
tempered with love.

11:08.968 --> 11:11.266
You created them for one reason...

11:11.437 --> 11:16.841
...so their prayers
would fuel our immortality.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.534
But you love them too well.

11:19.712 --> 11:21.202
They've grown strong.

11:21.380 --> 11:26.647
And now I am forced to rise
because we are all threatened.

11:26.819 --> 11:28.719
What do you want, brother?

11:28.888 --> 11:31.789
Let me loose upon them.

11:32.491 --> 11:34.789
They will pray again...

11:34.960 --> 11:38.123
...and you will bathe in their awe
and fear.

11:38.297 --> 11:41.232
And we will grow strong again.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.664
He belongs in the underworld, not here.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.100
You do not tell me where I belong.

11:48.307 --> 11:51.765
You say it is love that feeds us.

11:51.944 --> 11:55.539
But you depend on their love.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.479
I've only learned to live on their fear...

11:59.518 --> 12:01.042
...their pain.

12:01.220 --> 12:05.623
Zeus, our brother speaks the truth.
Hear him.

12:11.931 --> 12:14.456
Go. Do what you will.

12:14.633 --> 12:16.032
Father, we need the mortals.

12:16.202 --> 12:17.499
No, Apollo.

12:17.670 --> 12:19.137
Hades is right.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.899
Their insolence has a price.

12:22.074 --> 12:26.033
Like children, they need to be
reminded of the order of things.

12:26.212 --> 12:28.373
Set an example, brother.

12:28.547 --> 12:30.344
Turn them on each other...

12:31.283 --> 12:33.251
...and back into our arms.

13:14.794 --> 13:17.695
- Are we the last boat to come in?
No, captain.

13:18.130 --> 13:20.098
You're the only one.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.624
Is he one of ours?

13:22.802 --> 13:25.430
No. We found him off Paxos
amongst our dead.

13:25.604 --> 13:27.094
He was the only survivor.

13:27.273 --> 13:30.003
Let the palace figure out
what to do with him.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.807
Squad by four!

13:33.512 --> 13:35.002
Go on.

13:36.415 --> 13:38.280
Because if we show the gods our love...

13:38.450 --> 13:40.714
...they shall show us love in return.
They shall.

13:40.886 --> 13:43.446
They gave us the corn in the fields,
the sun in the sky.

13:43.622 --> 13:45.180
These are all gifts given to us.

13:45.357 --> 13:47.689
Gifts can be taken away.
This will be taken away...

13:47.860 --> 13:49.589
...if we do not pay love to our gods.

13:49.762 --> 13:53.493
If we do not, we stay in filth and misery,
which we have brought upon ourselves.

13:53.666 --> 13:56.362
Move. Out of the way.
Our gods, we beg for the whip...

13:56.535 --> 13:59.402
The beauty and clarity of servitude.

13:59.738 --> 14:03.333
Man cannot rule man. You defy the gods
and you will be punished.

14:43.515 --> 14:44.743
Is this all there is?

14:45.417 --> 14:47.942
We lost many men, Your Majesty...

14:48.120 --> 14:49.951
...but we have victory.

14:52.491 --> 14:55.722
To King Kepheus! To Queen Cassiopeia!

14:59.565 --> 15:00.896
No.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.395
To you...

15:07.606 --> 15:09.073
...our mighty legion.

15:09.241 --> 15:13.974
Our heroes who have dared
to strike a blow at the heart of Zeus!

15:17.082 --> 15:19.073
The temples are burning.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.515
The statues have fallen.

15:21.687 --> 15:24.121
We have starved them of our prayers.

15:24.556 --> 15:25.784
Tonight...

15:25.958 --> 15:28.324
...after a generation of struggle...

15:28.494 --> 15:31.156
...the sun does not set over the ocean.

15:31.330 --> 15:34.629
It sets on Olympus itself.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.368
A new era has begun.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.361
The era of man!

15:42.241 --> 15:44.106
That frown doesn't suit you, Andromeda.

15:44.276 --> 15:47.302
Have something to drink.
You'll feel more lively.

15:50.749 --> 15:52.649
Andromeda.

16:02.594 --> 16:03.618
What's your name?

16:04.596 --> 16:05.620
Perseus.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.260
Take this.

16:09.702 --> 16:11.636
Please drink.

16:15.174 --> 16:16.903
Hands off.
Enough.

16:17.076 --> 16:19.909
Our daughter, the missionary.

16:21.981 --> 16:24.848
Have you seen what's happening
out there?

16:25.417 --> 16:27.214
Have you even bothered to look?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.483
We serve as an inspiration.

16:29.655 --> 16:32.818
Hundreds of our men
have lost their lives...

16:33.292 --> 16:35.453
...yet we celebrate.

16:35.894 --> 16:39.022
You provoke the gods and you act
as if there will be no consequence.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.189
Well, what do you want?
Should we be afraid?

16:41.367 --> 16:45.531
Should we be trembling
and soiling ourselves in fear?

16:45.704 --> 16:47.228
The gods need us.

16:47.406 --> 16:48.703
They need our worship.

16:49.641 --> 16:51.905
What do we need of them?

16:52.077 --> 16:54.671
- Look at my daughter.
- Don't.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.873
What could be more divine than her face?

16:58.050 --> 17:00.575
More beautiful
than all the women of Greece.

17:00.753 --> 17:05.348
More beautiful than Aphrodite herself.
The Olympians should envy her.

17:05.523 --> 17:10.393
- We are the gods now.
- My queen. You're making a spectacle.

17:55.507 --> 17:56.735
Interesting.

17:56.909 --> 17:58.900
You!

18:17.396 --> 18:21.162
You are specks of dust
beneath our fingernails.

18:21.667 --> 18:24.636
Your very breath is a gift from Olympus.

18:24.803 --> 18:28.466
You have insulted powers
beyond your comprehension.

18:29.074 --> 18:30.166
Who are you?

18:31.043 --> 18:34.479
I am Hades.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.045
Kneel.

18:47.226 --> 18:48.352
Not now, Perseus.

18:49.027 --> 18:50.324
You will have your chance.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.565
What do you know of beauty?

18:59.738 --> 19:02.707
What is more beautiful than death?

19:06.979 --> 19:10.346
Gaze upon me, mortal queen.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.517
Mother.
Princess.

19:28.333 --> 19:29.925
In 10 days...

19:30.102 --> 19:33.333
...when the sun is eclipsed...

19:34.273 --> 19:36.764
...I will unleash the Kraken.

19:37.876 --> 19:40.106
Argos will be swept from the earth...

19:40.779 --> 19:43.441
...and all of you with it.

19:45.317 --> 19:46.875
Unless...

19:47.052 --> 19:50.078
...you sacrifice the princess...

19:50.255 --> 19:53.315
...you so foolishly compare to the gods.

19:53.492 --> 19:56.552
Only her blood will sate the Kraken...

19:56.728 --> 19:58.787
...and Zeus...

19:58.964 --> 20:02.832
...who you have so offended.

20:05.971 --> 20:08.565
Choose your penance, Argos.

20:08.740 --> 20:11.641
Destruction or sacrifice.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.937
This is the will of Zeus.

20:14.846 --> 20:18.976
The will of your father.

20:32.064 --> 20:35.158
There is a demigod in Argos.

20:36.868 --> 20:39.063
That is impossible.

20:39.871 --> 20:41.236
He's yours.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.903
His name is Perseus.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.443
We could offer him sanctuary.

20:48.647 --> 20:51.013
Have I heard his prayers?

20:51.183 --> 20:54.346
This son knows no love for me.

20:54.720 --> 20:58.486
He's no different from any of the others
who have turned their backs on us.

20:59.124 --> 21:02.525
For the last time, demigod, speak!

21:02.928 --> 21:06.694
- I'm not a demigod.
- Who are you? Why were you sent?

21:07.165 --> 21:08.496
I don't know.

21:16.408 --> 21:17.773
I advise against this, sire.

21:17.943 --> 21:20.912
- He's not to be trusted.
- What would you have me do? Draco.

21:24.449 --> 21:25.711
Leave him.

21:30.555 --> 21:32.284
Is it possible?

21:32.924 --> 21:35.688
If it's true you are the son of Zeus...

21:35.861 --> 21:37.726
...you can save us.

21:40.299 --> 21:41.789
You must save us.

21:41.967 --> 21:44.458
I can't save you. I'm just a man.

21:44.636 --> 21:48.231
My lord, as terrible as it is
to utter the words...

21:48.407 --> 21:50.136
...a sacrifice is the only way.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.038
Don't even say the word.

21:52.210 --> 21:53.643
He's right.

21:54.413 --> 21:56.711
No one should have to die for me.

21:57.849 --> 21:59.180
Let Perseus go.

22:00.218 --> 22:03.915
Sire, we need to get the princess
out of the city now.

22:04.089 --> 22:06.922
- I'll find a place to hide her.
- You can't hide from Hades.

22:07.092 --> 22:09.492
So says the bastard son of a god.

22:14.533 --> 22:16.228
My father...

22:17.135 --> 22:18.762
...was killed by a god.

22:20.038 --> 22:23.371
My mother, sister...

22:24.109 --> 22:27.840
...everyone I loved was killed by a god.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.838
I mend nets...

22:31.016 --> 22:32.950
...not wield a sword.

22:41.893 --> 22:44.521
So, demigod, you have a visitor.

22:45.931 --> 22:47.956
She says she knows you.

22:51.303 --> 22:54.238
My name is lo, Perseus.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.371
And how do you know me?

22:57.042 --> 22:58.907
I've watched you all your life.

22:59.478 --> 23:01.673
I guided you to your family.

23:05.283 --> 23:06.477
Are you a god?

23:06.651 --> 23:08.312
There are gods and there are men...

23:09.087 --> 23:11.988
...and there are those of us
who are in between.

23:12.424 --> 23:13.448
Many years ago...

23:14.092 --> 23:17.255
...I refused a god's advance.

23:17.429 --> 23:19.420
I was cursed with agelessness.

23:20.165 --> 23:22.133
That's not much of a curse.

23:22.300 --> 23:25.565
I've lived for years
watching my loved ones die.

23:26.171 --> 23:28.605
I imagine you're sympathetic
to that plight.

23:33.612 --> 23:35.375
Is it true?

23:37.549 --> 23:39.107
Am I the son of Zeus?

23:40.185 --> 23:41.243
Yes.

23:42.988 --> 23:47.357
The story of your birth
began with the rebellion of King Acrisius.

23:49.528 --> 23:54.591
<i>Mankind had grown tired
of the gods' mistreatment and cruelty.</i>

23:55.267 --> 23:58.794
<i>Acrisius led a siege on Olympus.</i>

24:00.071 --> 24:01.436
<i>It is said the other gods...</i>

24:01.606 --> 24:05.406
<i>...wanted to simply lay waste to Acrisius
and his army...</i>

24:05.577 --> 24:08.341
<i>...but Zeus loved man too much.</i>

24:08.513 --> 24:13.143
<i>Instead, he chose to make an example
of Acrisius.</i>

24:14.453 --> 24:17.911
<i>He disguised himself as the king...</i>

24:18.089 --> 24:21.456
<i>...and visited the chamber
where the king's wife was sleeping.</i>

24:21.626 --> 24:22.650
My king.

24:32.204 --> 24:33.865
Zeus?

24:40.212 --> 24:42.578
<i>Acrisius grew mad with rage.</i>

24:43.315 --> 24:46.341
He ordered the execution of his wife...

24:46.518 --> 24:48.918
...and Zeus' newborn son.

24:55.260 --> 24:56.693
I curse you, Zeus.

24:56.862 --> 24:59.330
I deny you the body you soiled...

24:59.498 --> 25:01.398
...and the bastard child with it!

25:05.070 --> 25:06.799
No!

25:20.151 --> 25:23.348
The queen and her child
were cast into the sea.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.547
Your mother was killed, but you...

25:25.724 --> 25:28.454
...part man, part god, you lived.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.161
I've watched over you ever since...

25:31.329 --> 25:35.356
...waiting for the day when you will help
bring an end to the tyranny of the gods.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.731
You were born to kill the Kraken.

25:40.906 --> 25:43.431
I don't know why I was born...

25:44.843 --> 25:46.777
...or what I am.

25:48.713 --> 25:50.738
But I know it's not the Kraken
I wanna kill.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.450
How do I get to Hades?

25:53.618 --> 25:55.643
If the Kraken falls...

25:55.820 --> 25:59.517
...Hades will be weak enough
for you to strike a deathly blow.

25:59.691 --> 26:02.455
Only then will you have the revenge
you seek.

26:02.627 --> 26:04.686
Then they better release me.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.398
If the Kraken can be killed...

26:10.569 --> 26:12.764
...the Stygian witches will know how.

26:12.938 --> 26:15.736
The witches are further away
than the legion has ever been.

26:15.907 --> 26:16.999
No man can go there.

26:17.175 --> 26:18.836
No man.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.673
Keep your distance, lo.

26:26.284 --> 26:29.481
Zeus, forgive us for these affronts
and protect us.

26:31.623 --> 26:34.319
And you still believe
they're going to help?

26:35.060 --> 26:36.459
This is suicide.

26:36.628 --> 26:38.960
And the shields. Come on, boys.

26:39.130 --> 26:41.155
It's a lost cause.

26:41.333 --> 26:43.961
We've no chance, and you know it.

26:44.302 --> 26:48.170
Here's who you drew into this, Perseus.
An honor guard.

26:49.474 --> 26:52.739
Young men who look good
on a reviewing stand...

26:52.911 --> 26:56.608
...and old soldiers,
heading towards retirement.

26:57.248 --> 26:59.443
Do you know what the Kraken is?

27:00.752 --> 27:04.882
The Kraken is the end of us.
A colossal, elemental beast.

27:05.056 --> 27:07.957
It doesn't think. It doesn't feel.
Even the gods fear it.

27:08.126 --> 27:12.529
- And you, you're going to kill it?
- Don't come.

27:13.098 --> 27:16.295
- I don't need your help.
- Of course not.

27:17.235 --> 27:19.328
You're the son of Zeus.

27:19.904 --> 27:21.997
- But we have orders.
Come, we need to leave!

27:22.173 --> 27:27.042
Gentlemen, may our journey be long,
filled with agony and torment...

27:27.212 --> 27:30.147
...and may we all complain about it
bitterly as old men.

27:30.315 --> 27:33.341
- So what should we bring?
- Bring everything.

27:37.622 --> 27:40.147
What makes you think the witches
will tell us anything?

27:40.325 --> 27:43.556
Oh, they'll tell us, or I'll kill them too.

27:48.600 --> 27:50.397
Come on. Let's go, boys.

27:51.803 --> 27:53.930
- What is this?
- Just leave it.

27:58.643 --> 28:02.272
Don't leave us
to the mercy of the gods! Please.

28:02.447 --> 28:05.041
Don't go. Please stay!

28:07.085 --> 28:10.054
Stay here. Please? Please? Help us.

28:12.223 --> 28:14.885
You're just going to
make the gods angrier. Please.

28:15.060 --> 28:17.119
Just sacrifice the princess!

28:17.295 --> 28:20.287
Watch your mouth! Stay back. Stay back!

28:20.465 --> 28:22.092
You'd think they might be thankful.

28:23.101 --> 28:24.363
You cannot desert us!

28:24.536 --> 28:26.299
Maybe they're tired of being thankful.

28:27.439 --> 28:28.963
Good news!

28:29.140 --> 28:31.233
My brother and I have decided...

28:31.409 --> 28:35.140
...to accompany you on your journey.
- We have enough strangers here.

28:35.313 --> 28:38.180
We can be of great help to you,
trust me. You'll need us.

28:38.349 --> 28:40.078
I need soldiers, not hunters.

28:41.519 --> 28:45.216
Which one of your soldiers
knows how to cut the impenetrable skin...

28:45.390 --> 28:46.823
...of the Nemean lion?

28:46.991 --> 28:51.052
Which one of them knows the soft points
on a centaur's armor?

28:51.229 --> 28:56.462
Which one of them knows which jugular
to slice on a five-headed Hydra?

28:57.235 --> 29:00.033
- The middle one.
- The middle one. Good guess.

29:00.205 --> 29:02.571
My brother and I, we know how to kill.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.368
- We enjoy it.
- Lf you can keep up...

29:04.542 --> 29:06.442
...and you don't mind dying, come along.

29:07.479 --> 29:09.674
It is death who should be afraid of us.

29:57.495 --> 29:59.463
King Acrisius.

29:59.631 --> 30:02.259
There is no Acrisius.

30:02.567 --> 30:04.626
Just Calibos.

30:12.510 --> 30:14.671
We have an enemy in common.

30:15.547 --> 30:17.913
- Zeus.
- Zeus.

30:21.219 --> 30:23.278
My brother.

30:25.523 --> 30:27.150
What do you want from me?

30:27.325 --> 30:31.728
Zeus' seed in your wife survived.

30:31.996 --> 30:34.521
The child of your shame.

30:35.733 --> 30:37.325
Perseus.

30:37.502 --> 30:38.992
He lives?

30:39.571 --> 30:42.062
You murdered your wife for nothing.

30:42.707 --> 30:48.202
Now Perseus hurls himself
from Argos to destroy me.

30:48.780 --> 30:50.509
He must die.

30:50.682 --> 30:55.244
- What would you have me do?
- Zeus must think I serve him...

30:55.420 --> 30:58.218
...but I am growing stronger.

30:58.857 --> 31:02.122
Until I possess my full power...

31:04.128 --> 31:07.461
...you will be my weapon.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.168
Come.

31:41.232 --> 31:42.722
Use this.

31:43.835 --> 31:46.804
Kill Perseus for me.

31:47.238 --> 31:51.072
And I'll destroy Zeus for you.

31:51.242 --> 31:53.233
I serve you.

31:53.411 --> 31:55.606
The boy will die.

32:00.718 --> 32:02.481
How far is it?

32:02.654 --> 32:04.645
Four days to the witches.

32:04.822 --> 32:08.258
Four days? I'm tired already.

32:11.462 --> 32:13.623
Here, use this.

32:18.536 --> 32:20.436
Would you like us to wait?

32:21.306 --> 32:23.171
Oops.

33:19.764 --> 33:21.356
You really are a fisherman.

33:21.532 --> 33:23.500
You should've seen my father.

33:23.935 --> 33:25.425
You.

33:26.037 --> 33:27.732
Bring your weapon.

33:37.415 --> 33:39.042
Have you handled a sword before?

33:39.217 --> 33:41.344
- There's been no need.
- I see.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.011
Left foot forward.

33:47.291 --> 33:50.749
Your motions should be fluid.

33:51.429 --> 33:53.624
The weapon is a part of you.

33:55.967 --> 33:57.195
Like the sting on a wasp.

34:00.238 --> 34:01.796
Stay focused.

34:02.306 --> 34:03.432
Know what's around you.

34:06.277 --> 34:08.643
Keep your balance at all times.

34:08.813 --> 34:10.280
You fall...

34:12.016 --> 34:13.210
...you die.

34:17.789 --> 34:19.154
Get up.

34:24.996 --> 34:26.554
Don't...

34:45.183 --> 34:46.775
There is a god in you.

34:47.552 --> 34:48.643
Be sure to bring it.

34:51.522 --> 34:53.353
End of lesson.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.311
Perseus.

36:19.577 --> 36:21.010
A gift from the gods.

36:21.646 --> 36:24.012
- Forged on Olympus.
- Why?

36:25.116 --> 36:26.276
Just accept it.

36:28.953 --> 36:30.420
I can do this as a man.

36:33.391 --> 36:34.415
So it's yours.

36:45.203 --> 36:47.967
Gentlemen, retrieve our savior.

37:43.661 --> 37:45.561
Shh.

37:48.199 --> 37:49.666
The Pegasus.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.862
No man has ever ridden one.

38:00.244 --> 38:02.212
It's a message.

38:02.513 --> 38:04.413
They're watching us.

38:21.565 --> 38:23.260
Perseus!

38:24.001 --> 38:25.866
Perseus!

38:27.938 --> 38:28.962
Perseus!

38:31.676 --> 38:33.576
Why does it always have to be...?
- Shh!

38:33.744 --> 38:35.336
Listen.

38:43.721 --> 38:45.484
Help me!

38:46.924 --> 38:48.357
Help me!

38:52.763 --> 38:55.357
You reek of your father.

40:01.232 --> 40:05.225
- Who was that?
- I don't know. Let's ask him.

40:49.213 --> 40:50.578
Let it go.

40:51.482 --> 40:52.506
No. We split up.

40:53.184 --> 40:55.152
Just follow the blood.

41:06.897 --> 41:08.125
Come on!

41:13.037 --> 41:15.665
Look! His blood.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.723
Are you happy now?

41:44.435 --> 41:45.663
Attack!

41:55.379 --> 41:56.869
Wait! Wait!

42:00.451 --> 42:02.214
What is that?

43:39.450 --> 43:40.747
Come on!

43:43.120 --> 43:44.144
Lxas!

43:45.623 --> 43:47.420
Spear!

44:06.810 --> 44:08.801
Draco!

44:26.363 --> 44:27.853
Faster!

44:33.504 --> 44:35.062
Let's go, let's go!

44:35.839 --> 44:37.170
Go, jump!

45:10.107 --> 45:12.371
Run!

45:12.543 --> 45:14.807
Back up! Back up! Back up!
There's more!

45:14.978 --> 45:17.276
- Run!
Everyone. Back to back!

45:30.728 --> 45:32.389
Stand your ground.

45:37.935 --> 45:40.961
Three more!
In the name of the gods, they're bigger.

46:01.291 --> 46:02.883
What are they?

46:03.794 --> 46:04.818
Djinn.

46:08.232 --> 46:11.065
I fought them in the legion.

46:11.235 --> 46:13.260
This is their desert.

46:13.804 --> 46:16.432
- Enemies?
- I thought so.

46:16.607 --> 46:20.509
They aren't human. Not anymore.
Desert conjurers, cutthroats.

46:20.677 --> 46:23.271
- Well, somebody should thank them.
What?

46:46.003 --> 46:49.495
- What is it?
- Venom. From Hades.

46:51.675 --> 46:55.668
- Pray. Pray to Zeus for strength.
- No. No.

46:55.846 --> 46:57.780
Pray to your damn father.

46:57.948 --> 47:00.075
Hear my prayer.
Protect and heal your son.

47:00.250 --> 47:02.684
- No.
Please, Zeus, hear me.

47:12.429 --> 47:14.363
Would you like some bread?

47:14.531 --> 47:16.226
Thank you.
Thank you.

47:16.400 --> 47:17.594
- Please.
Have some bread.

47:17.768 --> 47:19.326
Over here. Over here.

47:19.503 --> 47:21.664
- For you.
- Please.

47:31.248 --> 47:32.545
No.

47:33.517 --> 47:36.611
We must turn our hearts to Hades!

47:36.787 --> 47:39.085
It is the only way!

47:41.625 --> 47:43.593
Brothers and sisters!

47:44.194 --> 47:47.095
Come to me! Come!

47:49.900 --> 47:53.199
I have the way out of our misery.

47:53.370 --> 47:55.736
Hades has asked for the princess.

47:56.840 --> 48:00.867
Sacrifice one for the life of the city.

48:03.513 --> 48:05.913
Why do they remain silent
while we suffer?

48:06.083 --> 48:09.610
Why do they guard the woman
whose death will save us?

48:10.120 --> 48:12.111
Is she better than any one of you?

48:12.589 --> 48:15.422
We have long worshiped Zeus in Argos.

48:15.592 --> 48:19.926
But it is Hades
who now offers us salvation.

48:20.530 --> 48:24.591
We must pray to the one
who showed us our sin...

48:24.768 --> 48:27.703
...and who offers us redemption...

48:28.071 --> 48:29.971
...through blood.

48:45.088 --> 48:47.454
A bribe for the ferryman.

48:55.799 --> 48:57.699
When they get injured in battle...

48:57.868 --> 49:01.827
...they replace their limbs
with charwood and black magic.

49:03.473 --> 49:05.441
They feel no pain.

49:05.609 --> 49:07.406
Live hundreds of years.

49:07.577 --> 49:09.511
So how old is that one?

49:13.250 --> 49:16.048
I don't care. I don't trust them.

49:25.662 --> 49:27.357
You're burning.

49:31.401 --> 49:33.130
Drink this.

49:39.509 --> 49:40.533
I'll get more water.

50:19.116 --> 50:20.276
Come on!

50:24.888 --> 50:26.287
Look out!

50:35.966 --> 50:37.763
What?

50:38.702 --> 50:40.329
What's he saying?

50:40.937 --> 50:44.737
The Djinn have waited many years for
the one who will free them from the gods.

50:45.642 --> 50:48.543
- He says he is no friend of the humans.
- You don't say.

50:50.147 --> 50:52.547
But the only way we can help Perseus
is together.

51:00.157 --> 51:01.681
Draco.

51:02.225 --> 51:03.385
Look.

51:13.170 --> 51:14.637
Together.

51:32.556 --> 51:35.024
- He's not ready to travel.
- Time is slipping away, lo.

51:35.192 --> 51:37.990
- He may be a demigod, but he's still mortal.
- Feeling better?

51:38.161 --> 51:39.355
- Yeah, a bit.
- Good.

51:41.798 --> 51:43.527
Your pride is killing my men.

51:43.700 --> 51:46.362
- You were given gifts. Use them.
- Those gifts are a trap!

51:46.536 --> 51:48.800
- I don't care what they are. Use them.
- No.

51:49.272 --> 51:51.968
I will not use that sword
or anything that they give me!

51:52.142 --> 51:54.303
So we'll just continue to die.

52:02.518 --> 52:04.543
I can't become like them.

52:07.556 --> 52:10.992
If I do this, I do it as a man.

52:12.895 --> 52:15.261
But you are not just a man.

52:16.198 --> 52:17.961
I choose to be.

52:19.135 --> 52:21.603
A man cannot do this, Perseus.

52:22.271 --> 52:23.636
According to who?

52:23.806 --> 52:25.569
The gods?

52:38.154 --> 52:40.019
If I had your gifts...

52:41.390 --> 52:44.188
When you need your sword,
it's in my bag.

52:55.304 --> 52:56.328
They're riding them.

53:11.988 --> 53:14.218
They tried to kill us. I'm not getting on it.

53:16.625 --> 53:18.286
Magnificent.

53:18.461 --> 53:20.520
What are you waiting for?

53:21.097 --> 53:23.725
Well, we need to make up for lost time.

53:57.533 --> 53:59.125
We're making good time.

53:59.301 --> 54:02.202
Not good enough.
The eclipse is drawing near.

54:03.139 --> 54:05.664
How close are we to the Norn Mountains?

54:05.841 --> 54:09.277
It'll be two days
before we reach the witches.

54:14.717 --> 54:16.446
This thing is making me feel sick.

54:16.619 --> 54:18.746
Trust me, it's better to be on one
than in one.

54:26.695 --> 54:28.424
What, don't you ever smile?

54:28.597 --> 54:31.464
When I spit in the eyes of the gods...

54:32.701 --> 54:34.430
...then I'll smile.

55:13.676 --> 55:17.407
- What is this place?
- The Garden of Stygia.

55:18.447 --> 55:21.348
This is where the Kraken
defeated the Titans.

55:21.517 --> 55:23.747
It's what Argos will look like
when we fail.

55:24.820 --> 55:26.811
Every step we take
is an insult to the gods.

55:26.989 --> 55:29.116
- Good.
- Perseus.

55:30.226 --> 55:34.492
Only ask what you need to know.
Nothing more.

55:35.197 --> 55:36.721
Of course.

56:17.673 --> 56:18.799
Visitors.

56:18.974 --> 56:20.407
Who is it?
Visitors.

56:20.576 --> 56:22.510
Got the eye.

56:22.678 --> 56:25.044
Give it to me.
Who is it?

56:28.250 --> 56:30.309
Who is it? Who is it?

56:32.254 --> 56:33.812
The eye. Give it to me.

56:33.989 --> 56:35.286
Perseus, no.

56:36.192 --> 56:37.591
We didn't come here to fight.

56:39.628 --> 56:41.994
- We just have one question.
Young Perseus.

56:42.164 --> 56:44.462
Son of Zeus.
So fresh.

56:44.633 --> 56:45.657
Perseus.
Closer.

56:45.834 --> 56:46.892
A little nibble.

56:48.037 --> 56:50.597
- Flesh of a god.
Flesh of a god.

56:50.773 --> 56:54.038
- Witch.
- Don't. Easy.

56:56.078 --> 56:57.943
Stale meat, ladies.

57:03.085 --> 57:05.246
So which one's
gonna answer my question?

57:05.421 --> 57:07.821
You want to know about the Kraken.
Kraken?

57:08.290 --> 57:09.518
Do it.
- Kill it.

57:09.692 --> 57:11.785
- That's right.
A wasted journey.

57:11.961 --> 57:13.861
The Kraken fears no weapon.

57:14.663 --> 57:15.857
It must have a weakness.

57:16.999 --> 57:18.432
Maybe.

57:19.468 --> 57:21.060
But knowledge demands payment.

57:21.237 --> 57:23.467
- Sacrifice.
Sacrifice.

57:23.639 --> 57:24.765
Eusebios!
Watch out!

57:26.909 --> 57:29.104
Look out!
Lxas, shoot!

57:33.315 --> 57:34.873
Help!
The eye!

57:40.122 --> 57:44.525
Let him go! Do it!
You wouldn't dare.

57:45.394 --> 57:47.294
We cannot see the answers
without the eye!

57:47.463 --> 57:48.589
Let him go!

57:50.566 --> 57:52.534
Now answer the question.

57:53.202 --> 57:55.067
How do we kill the Kraken?

57:56.205 --> 57:57.797
- There is a solution.
Solution.

57:57.973 --> 57:59.634
But it is an impossible one.

57:59.808 --> 58:01.867
- Yeah?
- The Gorgon, Medusa.

58:02.044 --> 58:03.534
Medusa.

58:03.712 --> 58:06.875
Anything of flesh is killed by her gaze.

58:07.049 --> 58:10.849
Killed by her.
- Her prison lies across the River Styx...

58:11.020 --> 58:14.114
...at the edge of the underworld.
A Titan against a Titan.

58:14.290 --> 58:17.020
She's no use against the Kraken.
We can't control her.

58:18.694 --> 58:19.991
Then we take her head.

58:20.629 --> 58:24.121
Clever boy.
- Now the eye. Give us the eye.

58:24.300 --> 58:25.631
- The eye.
- The eye.

58:30.806 --> 58:31.932
Where is it?

58:36.578 --> 58:39.775
But wait. There's more.
Don't you want to know more?

58:39.948 --> 58:41.176
Perseus, no.

58:42.618 --> 58:44.347
Tell him.
Tell him.

58:44.520 --> 58:45.544
What?

58:45.721 --> 58:48.315
Your journey does not end well.

58:49.358 --> 58:51.258
Fate has spoken.

58:54.530 --> 58:57.727
You will die, son of Zeus!

59:00.369 --> 59:01.802
It's a lie. Come.

59:02.671 --> 59:03.899
Written as history.

59:06.875 --> 59:08.103
Perseus.

59:08.277 --> 59:11.337
You will die.

59:30.866 --> 59:32.356
Why are the Djinn leaving us?

59:32.534 --> 59:35.503
They believe we will all die.
It's the prophecy.

59:57.593 --> 59:58.617
Who are you?

01:00:07.102 --> 01:00:11.402
Well, you can call me "Father"...

01:00:12.374 --> 01:00:15.104
...if you wish.
- My father's dead.

01:00:15.711 --> 01:00:17.269
He was killed by a god.

01:00:17.446 --> 01:00:20.313
An unfortunate casualty
in a war men brought on themselves.

01:00:21.016 --> 01:00:24.747
Men didn't murder my family.
Your brother did.

01:00:25.687 --> 01:00:27.348
You heard the witches' prophesy.

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:29.991
You will not defeat the Kraken,
much less Hades.

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:34.323
If you continue this journey,
you will die, and Argos will still fall.

01:00:34.496 --> 01:00:36.157
If you're so sure, why are you here?

01:00:36.331 --> 01:00:38.128
To offer you sanctuary.

01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:42.100
Your blood is mine, Perseus,
and that makes you a god.

01:00:42.271 --> 01:00:44.933
It's time you came to Olympus
and started living like one.

01:00:45.107 --> 01:00:48.076
Rather die in the mud with those men
than live forever as a god.

01:00:48.243 --> 01:00:49.608
You foolish boy.

01:00:49.778 --> 01:00:52.770
Man's entire existence
is a gift of my grace.

01:00:52.948 --> 01:00:54.347
For someone who created man...

01:00:54.516 --> 01:00:56.916
...you don't know much about us.

01:00:57.586 --> 01:00:59.554
We live...

01:00:59.888 --> 01:01:02.448
...we fight and we die...

01:01:02.624 --> 01:01:05.320
...for each other, not for you.

01:01:07.029 --> 01:01:08.690
Tell Hades I'll see him soon.

01:01:09.998 --> 01:01:12.967
- I will not make this offer again.
- Good.

01:01:13.135 --> 01:01:15.035
Because I'd hate to refuse you twice.

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:17.263
Perseus.

01:01:17.439 --> 01:01:18.997
Wait.

01:01:25.747 --> 01:01:28.181
It's expensive where you're going.

01:01:52.341 --> 01:01:54.809
Kucuk fashioned this shield
from the Scorpioch.

01:01:56.078 --> 01:01:59.013
Stronger and lighter than any metal.

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:01.506
Very rare and high-quality item.

01:02:06.054 --> 01:02:07.851
We can fight anywhere...

01:02:09.925 --> 01:02:12.257
...but not in the underworld.

01:02:13.462 --> 01:02:14.986
Yeah.

01:02:19.568 --> 01:02:21.058
Good luck, fisherman.

01:02:35.784 --> 01:02:37.718
We all heard what the witches said.

01:02:39.087 --> 01:02:41.385
But we can prove them wrong.

01:02:43.025 --> 01:02:44.390
I need your help.

01:02:55.470 --> 01:02:57.370
It wasn't the gods
that saved me up there.

01:02:59.908 --> 01:03:02.240
If you believe that we have a chance.

01:03:06.214 --> 01:03:08.409
I never liked Argos much anyway.

01:03:13.689 --> 01:03:15.384
I know the way.

01:03:20.295 --> 01:03:23.492
Then we go to the underworld.
We kill Medusa.

01:04:13.615 --> 01:04:17.381
Now what?
- We wait for Charon.

01:04:18.453 --> 01:04:20.148
Charon only ferries the dead.

01:04:21.189 --> 01:04:22.713
Any volunteers?

01:04:32.934 --> 01:04:34.128
Heads we swim.

01:04:59.861 --> 01:05:01.954
A bribe for the ferryman.

01:05:57.786 --> 01:05:59.481
So, what happens when we get there?

01:06:00.322 --> 01:06:01.721
Just another beast to kill.

01:06:02.491 --> 01:06:04.118
A beast?

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.420
Medusa was beautiful once.

01:06:07.596 --> 01:06:10.429
So beautiful as to tempt Poseidon.

01:06:10.599 --> 01:06:12.794
When he came for her...

01:06:12.968 --> 01:06:17.166
...she ran to Athena's temple thinking
that the goddess would protect her.

01:06:17.906 --> 01:06:19.396
She didn't.

01:06:20.709 --> 01:06:22.904
Poseidon took her on the cold floor.

01:06:23.712 --> 01:06:26.078
She prayed to Athena for comfort...

01:06:26.248 --> 01:06:28.614
...but the goddess felt nothing
but disgust.

01:06:28.784 --> 01:06:32.447
She made sure
no one would ever want Medusa again.

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:36.921
One look at the creature she has become
will turn any living thing to stone.

01:06:37.726 --> 01:06:41.423
I cannot assist you there.
A curse prevents me.

01:06:42.531 --> 01:06:46.524
It was Athena's one bit of solace to Medusa
so that Medusa would never harm a woman.

01:06:47.736 --> 01:06:50.261
Only men are allowed in the temple.

01:06:51.139 --> 01:06:53.869
Though no man has ever made it out.

01:07:27.809 --> 01:07:30.903
Medusa's got a tail
and that's how she'll use it.

01:07:32.147 --> 01:07:33.637
Listen.

01:07:34.416 --> 01:07:36.976
Hear her muscles coil.

01:07:37.652 --> 01:07:40.052
Smell her skin.

01:07:40.722 --> 01:07:43.418
Feel her hunger in your gut.

01:07:44.726 --> 01:07:46.216
Medusa's killed you twice now.

01:07:47.495 --> 01:07:52.023
Do you think she'll hand you her head?
She won't be gracious about it.

01:07:52.500 --> 01:07:55.901
One look in her eyes
and you'll turn to stone.

01:07:57.772 --> 01:07:59.262
Good.

01:08:03.078 --> 01:08:06.479
- Try not to enjoy this so much.
- I'm trying to help you live.

01:08:08.516 --> 01:08:09.813
Don't look at me.

01:08:30.372 --> 01:08:32.237
Ease your storm.

01:08:41.216 --> 01:08:42.911
We're nearing Medusa's lair.

01:08:59.301 --> 01:09:02.429
I never thought I could reach this place.

01:09:04.372 --> 01:09:05.634
Who'd you lose?

01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:14.109
My daughter.

01:09:16.184 --> 01:09:18.812
Taken away on her 16th birthday.

01:09:20.087 --> 01:09:22.318
Dragged down here.

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:25.225
I have a feeling I'll see her soon.

01:09:29.096 --> 01:09:32.794
You brought us this far.
Let's go the rest of the way.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.020
- How many coins did you get, Perseus?
- Just the one.

01:10:21.349 --> 01:10:23.340
I only knew one great man in my life.

01:10:26.354 --> 01:10:27.878
My father.

01:10:30.892 --> 01:10:32.086
Now I know four more.

01:10:35.964 --> 01:10:36.988
And a woman.

01:10:40.035 --> 01:10:41.434
And whatever the hell you are.

01:10:46.207 --> 01:10:48.300
I know we're all afraid.

01:10:48.576 --> 01:10:50.009
But my father told me:

01:10:50.178 --> 01:10:53.204
Someday someone was gonna have to
take a stand.

01:10:53.715 --> 01:10:56.878
Someday someone
was gonna have to say, "Enough."

01:10:59.788 --> 01:11:01.016
This could be that day.

01:11:03.058 --> 01:11:04.855
Trust your senses.

01:11:05.026 --> 01:11:07.187
And don't look this bitch in the eye.

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:41.785
- Doesn't really inspire confidence.
- Quiet.

01:11:42.297 --> 01:11:44.561
- Listen.
Eusebios.

01:11:44.732 --> 01:11:46.529
Keep your eyes down.

01:12:08.823 --> 01:12:10.017
Here we go.

01:12:20.768 --> 01:12:22.793
Solon!

01:12:26.941 --> 01:12:28.272
Keep going!

01:12:30.745 --> 01:12:32.406
Flank her.

01:12:36.384 --> 01:12:39.046
- Draco.
- Go!

01:12:40.121 --> 01:12:41.554
Eusebios, follow me.

01:12:46.995 --> 01:12:48.292
Hang on!

01:13:21.629 --> 01:13:23.494
Eusebios.

01:13:26.034 --> 01:13:28.332
Remember what Perseus said.

01:13:34.609 --> 01:13:36.406
Eyes down.

01:13:50.959 --> 01:13:52.517
Lxas, no.

01:13:59.167 --> 01:14:00.657
Eyes down.

01:14:05.506 --> 01:14:08.031
Where are you?

01:14:10.144 --> 01:14:12.009
Where are you?

01:14:20.455 --> 01:14:22.218
Eusebios.

01:14:28.463 --> 01:14:29.896
Go!

01:14:44.779 --> 01:14:46.406
Wait here.

01:14:47.949 --> 01:14:49.007
I'll lure her out.

01:14:50.318 --> 01:14:51.979
Get ready.

01:15:39.334 --> 01:15:40.392
Now!

01:15:57.685 --> 01:16:00.483
Together.

01:16:42.530 --> 01:16:44.930
Let them know men did this.

01:18:10.585 --> 01:18:12.450
Just you and me, son of Zeus.

01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:23.980
Perseus.

01:19:24.926 --> 01:19:26.689
Don't become one of them.

01:19:42.510 --> 01:19:44.307
lo, I'm here.

01:19:46.714 --> 01:19:48.705
There's no time.

01:19:51.686 --> 01:19:53.313
The eclipse.

01:19:54.622 --> 01:19:58.023
Perseus, you must go before it's too late.

01:20:02.897 --> 01:20:04.455
I'm not going anywhere.

01:20:05.666 --> 01:20:07.759
My fate is certain.

01:20:07.935 --> 01:20:11.268
But the fate of Argos
is still in your hands.

01:20:12.173 --> 01:20:14.505
All my life you've been there.

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:16.836
You never left me.

01:20:18.946 --> 01:20:20.106
I can't leave you.

01:20:21.916 --> 01:20:24.407
This part of the journey
you must do alone.

01:20:25.119 --> 01:20:26.518
Perseus...

01:20:26.687 --> 01:20:29.019
...you're not just part man, part god...

01:20:31.258 --> 01:20:33.419
...you're the best of both.

01:20:38.933 --> 01:20:41.299
Everything will be all right.

01:21:37.091 --> 01:21:38.649
Brother.

01:21:39.293 --> 01:21:42.751
It is time for the mortals to pay.

01:21:45.466 --> 01:21:47.832
My child waits to do your will.

01:21:58.345 --> 01:22:00.074
Leave us.

01:22:07.121 --> 01:22:09.385
Release the Kraken!

01:22:37.017 --> 01:22:40.077
The Kraken comes now!

01:22:40.554 --> 01:22:44.888
Our suffering ends
when the beast is sated!

01:22:45.459 --> 01:22:47.450
Will it take us...

01:22:48.262 --> 01:22:51.390
...or will it take Andromeda?

01:22:51.565 --> 01:22:53.624
Andromeda!

01:22:56.837 --> 01:22:58.600
It's my name they're calling.

01:22:59.774 --> 01:23:02.038
This cannot continue.

01:23:12.453 --> 01:23:14.580
Stay back!
Stay back!

01:23:44.618 --> 01:23:47.348
Look! The Kraken! Help us!

01:24:14.381 --> 01:24:16.474
Andromeda!

01:24:18.986 --> 01:24:23.980
Hades, we sacrifice our princess
in your name.

01:24:29.530 --> 01:24:32.761
It comes, brothers and sisters!

01:25:03.731 --> 01:25:05.358
Argos has fallen.

01:25:06.433 --> 01:25:09.095
Do you feel stronger, brother?

01:25:09.737 --> 01:25:12.467
You thought the Kraken
would bring you their prayers.

01:25:13.007 --> 01:25:17.239
But the Kraken is my child.
It feeds only me.

01:25:17.411 --> 01:25:20.778
I command Olympus.
Remember who you serve.

01:25:21.448 --> 01:25:23.712
I serve myself.

01:25:23.884 --> 01:25:26.978
I have since you cheated me.

01:25:28.255 --> 01:25:30.450
You sent me to the underworld
to be hated...

01:25:30.624 --> 01:25:32.717
...while you basked in their love.

01:25:33.827 --> 01:25:35.385
We need the love of humans.

01:25:35.562 --> 01:25:37.462
No, you need it.

01:25:37.631 --> 01:25:39.258
I survive on their fear.

01:25:39.867 --> 01:25:42.028
Your reign is over, brother Zeus.

01:25:42.202 --> 01:25:46.298
You'll watch while my blessed avenger
devours their hopes.

01:25:46.473 --> 01:25:49.499
And then finally you'll know my pain.

01:25:50.077 --> 01:25:53.308
There is still a demigod in Argos...

01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:55.175
...brother.

01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:01.080
Perseus.

01:26:34.221 --> 01:26:36.519
The bag! Come on!

01:26:49.036 --> 01:26:50.697
Hyah!

01:28:07.147 --> 01:28:10.412
Hey, fisherman!

01:29:15.415 --> 01:29:17.110
Come on!

01:30:21.582 --> 01:30:23.447
No!

01:31:10.564 --> 01:31:12.327
I'm a god.

01:31:12.499 --> 01:31:14.228
I will live forever.

01:31:14.401 --> 01:31:15.834
But not here.

01:32:41.588 --> 01:32:44.079
The boats are coming for us.

01:32:49.062 --> 01:32:50.495
For you. Not for me.

01:32:51.965 --> 01:32:53.557
You won't stay, will you?

01:32:55.235 --> 01:32:57.100
Perseus, Argos needs a ruler.

01:32:58.004 --> 01:32:59.335
I cannot be a king.

01:33:00.340 --> 01:33:02.171
I serve you better as a man.

01:33:03.410 --> 01:33:05.878
You'll make a fine queen for them.

01:33:45.886 --> 01:33:48.684
Olympus owes you a debt of gratitude.

01:33:50.323 --> 01:33:51.950
As do I.

01:33:52.125 --> 01:33:53.752
Hades lives.

01:33:54.227 --> 01:33:56.525
He's just sent back to the underworld.

01:33:56.696 --> 01:33:58.630
Biding his time, no doubt.

01:33:58.799 --> 01:34:02.496
Waiting for men to grow weak,
and in their weakness, he grows stronger.

01:34:03.370 --> 01:34:05.634
It's mankind who holds the key
to Hades' rise.

01:34:05.806 --> 01:34:06.830
It always was.

01:34:07.007 --> 01:34:09.407
So we'll see him again.

01:34:10.010 --> 01:34:11.272
Yes.

01:34:11.445 --> 01:34:14.243
But now the world knows
a man can stop him.

01:34:15.048 --> 01:34:17.846
Of course, you had some help.

01:34:18.018 --> 01:34:21.181
A sword, the Pegasus...

01:34:22.155 --> 01:34:26.819
I wanted men to worship us again,
but I didn't want it to cost me a son.

01:34:29.095 --> 01:34:30.357
That's almost human of you.

01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:34.330
I don't suppose you'll reconsider my offer
to take your place as one of us.

01:34:38.939 --> 01:34:41.339
I've got everything I need right here.

01:34:42.142 --> 01:34:44.007
You may not want to be a god, Perseus...

01:34:44.177 --> 01:34:47.704
...but after feats like yours,
men will worship you.

01:34:49.115 --> 01:34:50.980
Be good to them.

01:34:51.151 --> 01:34:53.483
Be better than we were.

01:34:54.721 --> 01:34:58.088
And if you insist on continuing
this mundane human existence...

01:34:58.258 --> 01:35:00.021
...I won't have you do it alone.

01:35:01.361 --> 01:35:02.953
You're the son of Zeus, after all.
