10:40.416 --> 10:41.416
Whew!

10:41.450 --> 10:45.050
That a--that water's
down here somewhere.

10:45.083 --> 10:47.116
The dowsing rod
says so.

10:47.150 --> 10:48.200
Wrong.

10:48.233 --> 10:50.000
The water
is up here. Science
tells me so.

10:50.033 --> 10:52.316
With my state-of-the-art
triple-filtering flask,

10:52.350 --> 10:54.350
any liquid source
can be filtered
through

10:54.383 --> 10:56.000
its triple layers
of charcoal,

10:56.033 --> 10:59.350
removing 99.9%
of the organic
wasted impurities,

10:59.383 --> 11:01.233
thus leaving you
with a glass

11:01.266 --> 11:04.350
of clean,
crystal-clear,

11:04.383 --> 11:08.083
ice-cold
drinking water.

11:08.116 --> 11:09.450
[Panting]

11:09.483 --> 11:12.000
No sweat.
Pun intended.

11:12.033 --> 11:13.200
[Gulping]

11:13.233 --> 11:14.450
Aah! Refreshing.

11:14.483 --> 11:16.233
But don't let me
spoil your fun.

11:16.266 --> 11:18.183
I'll see you back
at the Van.

11:18.216 --> 11:20.400
Ha ha ha!

11:20.433 --> 11:21.433
That's it!

11:21.466 --> 11:23.283
I am taking all
your evil techno gadgets

11:23.316 --> 11:25.283
and locking them
in the Van.

11:25.316 --> 11:27.000
There!

11:30.150 --> 11:33.416
Aah! Nothing like a stroll
in the wilderness

11:33.450 --> 11:36.033
to realign
one's chakras.

11:36.066 --> 11:38.100
Under
the moonlit sky.

11:38.133 --> 11:39.200
The fresh air...

11:39.233 --> 11:41.133
The soothing
sounds...

11:41.166 --> 11:43.050
The fragrant smells.

11:43.083 --> 11:46.216
I love nature
at night.

11:46.250 --> 11:47.400
I hate nature
at night:

11:47.433 --> 11:49.483
It's too quiet,
the air smells funny,

11:50.016 --> 11:51.000
I can't see a thing,

11:51.033 --> 11:52.316
the thin air
is killing my sinuses,

11:52.350 --> 11:55.366
and i'm...Being
eaten alive out here.

11:55.400 --> 11:56.483
My feet hurt.

11:57.016 --> 11:58.050
Can't we go back?

11:58.083 --> 11:59.250
I have to go
to the bathroom.

11:59.283 --> 12:00.316
When we get back,

12:00.350 --> 12:02.283
I'm turning you two in
to the humane society.

12:02.316 --> 12:05.366
Are you two
even listening
to me?

12:05.400 --> 12:06.483
[Wolf howling]

12:07.016 --> 12:09.066
Windbear? Oceanbird?

12:09.100 --> 12:10.383
Hello?

12:10.416 --> 12:11.383
[Crack]

12:11.416 --> 12:12.283
Wha--

12:12.316 --> 12:14.283
what's that?
Who's there?

12:14.316 --> 12:16.216
D--Dexter?

12:16.250 --> 12:17.300
[Growling]

12:17.333 --> 12:19.166
Aah!

12:20.483 --> 12:22.433
[Watch alarm sounding]

12:22.466 --> 12:24.116
Aah!

12:24.150 --> 12:25.150
Aha ha!

12:25.183 --> 12:27.133
My wrist communicator--
I still have it.

12:27.166 --> 12:28.350
No thanks
to windbear.

12:28.383 --> 12:31.466
Just a push of a button,
and my robots will come
to my aid.

12:32.000 --> 12:33.200
Ha ha!

12:33.233 --> 12:35.083
So long, nature.

12:35.116 --> 12:36.050
Hey!

12:36.083 --> 12:38.166
Come back here!
Come back here!

12:38.200 --> 12:40.133
Come back...

12:40.166 --> 12:41.250
Here.

12:41.283 --> 12:42.200
[Sobs]

12:42.233 --> 12:45.483
No food, no water,
no gadgets.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.033
What was that thing

12:47.066 --> 12:49.083
that I wasn't listening
to windbear saying

12:49.116 --> 12:50.483
about surviving
in the wild?

12:51.016 --> 12:53.116
Take a stick
and a Berry,

12:53.150 --> 12:55.033
and if you rub
the 2 together,

12:55.066 --> 12:57.133
you'll get water.

12:59.183 --> 13:00.333
I'm doomed.

13:00.366 --> 13:02.216
[Sobs]

13:02.250 --> 13:04.316
What am I to do?

13:05.333 --> 13:06.416
What am I saying?

13:06.450 --> 13:08.450
I mandark, evil genius,
possesses a superior mind

13:08.483 --> 13:10.366
to over come
any obstacle.

13:10.400 --> 13:13.300
I will tame
this wild beast
called nature.

13:13.333 --> 13:15.100
I will survive.

13:15.133 --> 13:16.366
I will survive.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.183
I will survive.

13:55.150 --> 13:58.150
I denounce science.
I throw away technology.

13:58.183 --> 13:59.216
I embrace the natural

13:59.250 --> 14:01.266
and harness the powers
of the forest spirits,

14:01.300 --> 14:05.200
for I am
mountain mandark,

14:05.233 --> 14:09.000
and I am king
of the mountains.

14:09.033 --> 14:10.183
Ha ha ha!

14:10.216 --> 14:11.416
What's that sound?

14:11.450 --> 14:13.100
[Cars honking]

14:13.133 --> 14:14.316
Civilization?
Technology?

14:14.350 --> 14:17.150
Thank goodness.
I got to get out
of this rotten place.

14:17.183 --> 14:20.000
I'm coming home, lab.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.333
Ha ha ha!

14:22.366 --> 14:25.133
Well, I guess
that about
wraps it up.

14:25.166 --> 14:27.300
Pun intended.

14:42.483 --> 14:45.283
Ha ha ha!

14:45.316 --> 14:46.266
At last,

14:46.300 --> 14:48.350
my darkest creation
is completed.

14:48.383 --> 14:49.466
With a push
of this button,

14:50.000 --> 14:51.383
I will unleash
a mind-bending
transmitter,

14:51.416 --> 14:55.133
which will
put the world
under my control.

15:03.050 --> 15:05.316
[Beeping]

15:07.083 --> 15:08.000
Who is it?

15:08.033 --> 15:09.333
Dexter:
Hello, mandark?

15:09.366 --> 15:10.450
This is Dexter.

15:10.483 --> 15:12.316
How dare
you call me.

15:12.350 --> 15:13.300
Ah, you see?

15:13.333 --> 15:15.333
That is exactly why
I am calling.

15:15.366 --> 15:18.100
This constant feud
of good and evil

15:18.133 --> 15:19.483
just is not working
for me.

15:20.016 --> 15:23.166
Well, get used to it,
because you'll never
defeat me.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.466
Exactly my point.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.050
I'm glad to hear

15:26.083 --> 15:27.466
you're
finally beginning
to see the light.

15:28.000 --> 15:29.450
When you're
so diabolical...

15:29.483 --> 15:31.050
Uh-huh.

15:31.083 --> 15:32.133
Right.

15:32.166 --> 15:33.000
Yeah.

15:33.033 --> 15:34.066
Uh-huh.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.433
You see, that is why
I am giving you my lab.

15:36.466 --> 15:39.100
Yeah, so deranged,
so...

15:39.133 --> 15:41.450
Did you just say...

15:41.483 --> 15:44.200
That is right.

15:44.233 --> 15:46.066
I'm sorry,
can you repeat that.

15:46.100 --> 15:47.100
I didn't hear you.

15:47.133 --> 15:49.100
I am giving you
my laboratory.

15:49.133 --> 15:50.300
Well, you are
probably thinking,

15:50.333 --> 15:52.400
what is that
poor little genius
up to?

15:52.433 --> 15:55.183
But I promise,
no tricks.

15:55.216 --> 15:57.183
How stupid
do you think I am?

15:57.216 --> 16:00.000
I'm not stepping one foot
in your lab.

16:00.033 --> 16:01.416
Hey, man,
how's it going?

16:01.450 --> 16:03.083
Welcome to my home.

16:03.116 --> 16:05.116
I don't know
what you're up to, but--

16:05.150 --> 16:06.250
relax. Relax.

16:06.283 --> 16:08.416
Everything
is cool, man.

16:08.450 --> 16:10.433
Once you see
the lab, you will--

16:10.466 --> 16:11.450
hyah! Hyah!

16:11.483 --> 16:13.316
Hyah! Hyah!

16:13.350 --> 16:18.050
Would you like me
to hang your cape?

16:18.083 --> 16:20.316
Heh heh!
Hang my cape?

16:20.350 --> 16:22.300
Thanks.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.216
Hmm...

16:25.316 --> 16:28.350
Now just behind
this unassuming bookcase
lies--

16:28.383 --> 16:32.233
mandark, would I
really go through
all this trouble

16:32.266 --> 16:34.100
for some prank?

16:34.133 --> 16:36.400
That's the way.

16:36.433 --> 16:41.066
Behold. Dexter's lab.

16:41.100 --> 16:43.200
Follow me, please.

16:54.450 --> 16:57.066
Aha! A trap!

16:57.100 --> 16:58.083
No!

16:58.116 --> 17:00.066
Why?! Why?! Why?!

17:00.100 --> 17:02.150
[Sobbing]

17:02.183 --> 17:03.216
Mandark.

17:03.250 --> 17:04.200
Mandark.

17:04.233 --> 17:05.150
Huh?

17:05.183 --> 17:06.233
Let me know
when you are done,

17:06.266 --> 17:08.266
and I'll show you
the rest of the lab.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.350
Here we have
the main directory.

17:10.383 --> 17:13.350
My lab is divided
into 5 sectors:

17:13.383 --> 17:15.133
Artificial
intelligence,

17:15.166 --> 17:16.316
synthetic
technology,

17:16.350 --> 17:18.150
biochemistry,
electromechanics,

17:18.183 --> 17:19.283
and top secret stuff.

17:19.316 --> 17:21.366
Anything
you would like
to see first?

17:21.400 --> 17:23.183
Um, top secret stuff?

17:23.216 --> 17:25.250
Good choice.
Right this way.

17:25.283 --> 17:29.183
To your left,
we have your basic
robot army,

17:29.216 --> 17:32.133
alien communicator,
atom smasher,

17:32.166 --> 17:35.266
teleporter,
giant robot,
time portal.

17:35.300 --> 17:37.316
Yeah, I'm sure you
got all this stuff

17:37.350 --> 17:38.416
back at your lab.

17:38.450 --> 17:41.016
Uh, oh,
yeah, totally.

17:41.050 --> 17:44.466
Ah, yes, this is
a personal favorite.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.466
By a process
of neural infusion,

17:47.000 --> 17:50.100
I am able to harness
the collective
unconscious,

17:50.133 --> 17:51.250
thus,
for a limited time,

17:51.283 --> 17:53.416
becoming
the smartest being
on earth.

17:53.450 --> 17:56.183
Not specifically
diabolical,

17:56.216 --> 17:57.333
but hey--ha ha ha!--

17:57.366 --> 17:59.283
it couldn't hurt,
right?

17:59.316 --> 18:00.483
Right.

18:01.016 --> 18:02.050
I mean, I guess.

18:02.083 --> 18:04.033
Would you like
to try it?

18:04.066 --> 18:08.033
Just stand over there
and hold still.

18:10.083 --> 18:12.100
Hold it. Nice try.

18:12.133 --> 18:13.450
I see what
you're up to.

18:13.483 --> 18:15.233
Really, mandark.

18:15.266 --> 18:16.400
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

18:16.433 --> 18:17.433
Now hold still.

18:17.466 --> 18:22.300
Ah, if you must,
but you will see.

18:28.316 --> 18:30.050
If "x" is
a hypersulfuric surface

18:30.083 --> 18:32.400
composed of future
inextendable null
geodesic generators

18:32.433 --> 18:34.166
without equastics,

18:34.200 --> 18:37.033
I.e. The expansion
of the nil geodesics
comprising of the horizon,

18:37.066 --> 18:39.083
cannot become
negatively infinite.

18:39.116 --> 18:40.183
It worked.

18:40.216 --> 18:41.283
Well, of course
it did.

18:41.316 --> 18:44.450
Like I said, mandark,
my lab is your lab.

18:44.483 --> 18:46.433
Use it as you would
your own.

18:46.466 --> 18:48.083
For evil?
Whatever.

18:48.116 --> 18:49.450
How about a mind-bending
transmitter,

18:49.483 --> 18:52.283
which will allow me
to control the world?

18:52.316 --> 18:53.316
Why stop there?

18:53.350 --> 18:55.416
Why not control
the universe?

18:55.450 --> 18:57.150
Yes, the universe.

18:57.183 --> 18:59.450
Shall we
get started?

19:46.016 --> 19:48.300
[Crash]

20:09.116 --> 20:10.350
Whew!

20:10.383 --> 20:12.400
Ah, all done.

20:12.433 --> 20:13.450
It's about time.

20:13.483 --> 20:16.333
Well, let's see
what we've got.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.416
Ah!

20:19.450 --> 20:22.316
At last,
my darkest creation
is completed.

20:22.350 --> 20:23.416
After you.

20:23.450 --> 20:25.066
May I?

20:25.100 --> 20:26.216
With a push
of this button,

20:26.250 --> 20:28.316
I, mandark, will
unleash a mind-bending
transmission

20:28.350 --> 20:31.383
which will put
the entire universe
under my control.

20:31.416 --> 20:34.000
And that means you,
too, dorkster.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.083
I have
double-crossed you
once again.

20:36.116 --> 20:38.366
And now it will all
be mine.

20:38.400 --> 20:42.116
Ha ha ha!

20:42.150 --> 20:43.416
Ha!

20:55.416 --> 20:58.366
Ha! Well, well,
well, mandark,

20:58.400 --> 21:00.400
who double-crossed
whom?

21:00.433 --> 21:02.400
This was supposed
to be mine, Dexter.

21:02.433 --> 21:05.000
All mine, not yours.
Mine.

21:05.033 --> 21:07.150
Well, like
I always say,

21:07.183 --> 21:09.466
if you can't play
with the big dogs,

21:10.000 --> 21:12.083
stay on the porch.

21:12.116 --> 21:13.016
Ha ha!

21:13.050 --> 21:14.366
Hey! What is going on?

21:14.400 --> 21:18.233
I am trying to
wax poetic here.

21:20.383 --> 21:22.450
Man:
Enter at your own peril.

21:22.483 --> 21:25.433
Pass the bolted door

21:25.466 --> 21:29.216
where impossible things
may happen that the world's
never seen before.
