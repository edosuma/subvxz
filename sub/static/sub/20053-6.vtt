11:49.346 --> 11:52.650
Why wear a saddle when
you like to feel the horse?

11:52.683 --> 11:56.120
Because some horses...
they have Gonorrhea.

19:42.558 --> 19:43.760
[Chuckles]

19:44.316 --> 19:47.153
Okay, what did we learn from this?

19:47.187 --> 19:51.158
If I see a random line, say
"No, thank you, I'm fine."

19:51.191 --> 19:52.459
[Laughs] No, I'm serious.

19:52.491 --> 19:54.426
Something positive
should come out of this.

19:54.460 --> 19:56.529
We should... We should
do something for a kid.

19:58.753 --> 20:00.789
Hey, how about 13 kids?

20:03.923 --> 20:05.724
[Laughter]

20:05.920 --> 20:07.122
[Speaks Spanish]

20:07.154 --> 20:09.124
Man, that is a lot of children.

20:13.827 --> 20:15.096
Yes. <i>Corazon.</i>

20:15.128 --> 20:17.698
Love you, too. [Chuckles]

20:17.731 --> 20:19.200
Look at this.

20:19.232 --> 20:21.702
We put a little, tiny bit
of good into the world.

20:21.735 --> 20:24.105
- Mm-hmm.
- [Laughs]

20:26.406 --> 20:28.175
Holy shit. Is that...

20:28.209 --> 20:30.045
That's Robbie Butler!

20:30.077 --> 20:31.779
- Robbie Butler?
- Jim.

20:31.812 --> 20:33.113
The hell are you doing here, man?

20:33.146 --> 20:34.715
God, it's good to see you!

20:34.749 --> 20:37.085
- Good to see you, buddy.
- What are you up to?

20:37.117 --> 20:39.053
Well, I'm coaching at Oklahoma State.

20:39.087 --> 20:41.122
- Get out of here. Well, that's fantastic!
- Yeah.

20:41.154 --> 20:42.389
- Yeah.
- My God.

20:42.423 --> 20:43.724
How you doing?

20:43.758 --> 20:45.460
Oh, you know, I'm all right.

20:45.492 --> 20:49.063
Hey, Robbie. I... I got to say,

20:49.096 --> 20:51.331
[Sighs] of all the awful
things I did in my life,

20:51.365 --> 20:53.067
how I treated you was right up there.

20:53.100 --> 20:55.202
No, really. I mean,
you were a good friend

20:55.235 --> 20:57.137
and an adequate
broadcaster, and I just...

20:57.171 --> 21:00.141
I should have helped you out
more, and, well, I'm sorry.

21:00.173 --> 21:02.410
Well, it's great to
hear you say that, Jim.

21:02.442 --> 21:05.312
But, hey, listen. Before
we get into our shit, um...

21:05.346 --> 21:07.449
I got to tell you, the
reason I'm here is, uh...

21:07.481 --> 21:09.250
Joe Buck sent me to come talk...

21:09.282 --> 21:11.719
- Oh!
- No fighting!

21:11.752 --> 21:12.986
You chose the wrong side, Butler!

21:13.019 --> 21:14.321
- Jim!
- It's okay, kids.

21:14.355 --> 21:16.257
- They're just pretending!
- The kids!

21:16.289 --> 21:18.158
They need to see what
justice looks like!

21:18.192 --> 21:20.060
Stop it! No fighting! [Speaks Spanish]

21:20.094 --> 21:21.395
Right now, it looks like me

21:21.429 --> 21:23.992
beating the shit out of this traitor!
