00:59.727 --> 01:01.395
- There we go!

01:04.197 --> 01:05.366
And we're on.

01:24.485 --> 01:25.786
I accidentally hit un-record.

01:30.291 --> 01:31.459
Look at that.

01:40.268 --> 01:44.805
Is that a farm over there?
I love it.

01:44.872 --> 01:45.873
What did I tell you guys?

01:45.939 --> 01:49.410
Is this awesome or what?

01:49.477 --> 01:54.848
This is a very creepy area.

01:54.915 --> 01:55.549
- Yo, you got some good shit?

01:55.616 --> 01:58.452
- You know I am, man.

02:03.391 --> 02:08.461
- Look at Johnny and Nicole!

02:08.529 --> 02:13.601
- We got the money shot.

02:13.667 --> 02:17.571
Not that kind of money
shot, I apologize.

02:19.940 --> 02:23.444
- She's so cute!

02:23.511 --> 02:24.812
Kait's always prepared

02:24.878 --> 02:25.846
with some sort of
controlled substance.

02:25.913 --> 02:29.283
- Okay, now--

02:29.350 --> 02:29.850
- Oh, hi!

02:29.917 --> 02:39.860
- No.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.429
The end of something great.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.438
- This early example of the
German Expressionist movement

05:05.473 --> 05:07.441
was made during the
height of silent cinema

05:08.676 --> 05:13.447
and had a profound effect on
the history of horror films.

05:13.514 --> 05:14.682
Yes, Miss Monroe?

05:15.616 --> 05:17.451
- I love a good scary movie.

05:21.822 --> 05:24.558
- Yes, horror films have
fascinated the movie-going public

05:25.593 --> 05:27.160
since the beginning of
motion picture history.

05:27.227 --> 05:29.062
I would like you all
to ask yourselves

05:29.129 --> 05:31.632
what does horror mean to you?

05:33.567 --> 05:36.670
Now since this class is part
theory and part practical,

05:36.737 --> 05:39.540
I've created groups of five
person teams that will allow you

05:40.741 --> 05:43.010
to create a horror short
and present it here in class

05:43.076 --> 05:44.011
after the winter break.

05:44.077 --> 05:45.679
Yes, Miss Monroe?

05:45.746 --> 05:49.417
- Can we act in them?

05:49.483 --> 05:51.752
- That is up to your director.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.421
Okay, go out there
and make something

05:53.487 --> 05:54.622
that is special and personal.

05:57.791 --> 06:00.360
The local multiplexes are filled
with fast food hamburgers.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.564
Go out there and make
a finely cooked steak.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.503
- Winter
Ball's coming up.

06:11.772 --> 06:14.775
Maybe Darren will take me.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.744
You know, we haven't
been on that many dates.

06:16.810 --> 06:17.778
But that could be really fun.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.179
You wanna go?

06:19.246 --> 06:21.782
You could take
Johnny.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.216
- I don't think so.

06:23.283 --> 06:25.853
- You're not yourself today.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.856
- It's my mom.

06:28.922 --> 06:31.058
What about your mom?

06:31.124 --> 06:32.660
- She called and this
may be my last semester

06:33.260 --> 06:35.095
in the psych grad program.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.697
- But you only have
one more semester left.

06:37.297 --> 06:38.499
- I know.

06:42.536 --> 06:46.474
Yeah.

06:52.312 --> 06:53.346
- Aw, dude, look.

06:53.413 --> 06:54.548
They're about to make
out, look!

06:54.615 --> 06:57.084
- Dude, she's
upset about something.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.619
Come on, where's
your sensitivity?

06:58.686 --> 07:01.722
- Dude, where's your balls?

07:01.789 --> 07:02.456
What are we doin'
out here anyway?

07:02.523 --> 07:04.558
- We're testing the 7-D.

07:04.625 --> 07:05.893
Yeah well, if Lizzie knew

07:05.959 --> 07:08.095
I was watching her
she'd be pissed off.

07:08.161 --> 07:14.735
Plus I don't want her to
think I care that much, so.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.203
Ah, I see how it is.

07:17.905 --> 07:20.173
You like that
chocolate, huh?

07:20.240 --> 07:22.175
- Come on, dude, we're
gonna be late for class.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.443
- You
know, I can put a good word

07:23.511 --> 07:25.278
in with Lizzie for ya. You know.
- Dude.

07:26.947 --> 07:28.582
Dude, come on, that's
not, that's not cool.

07:28.649 --> 07:30.150
- Is that
Darren and Johnny?

07:31.752 --> 07:32.720
- Come on, dude.

07:32.786 --> 07:33.521
I don't even like
know her that well.

07:33.587 --> 07:34.387
- You know you want Nicole!

07:34.454 --> 07:35.455
- Oh my god.

07:35.523 --> 07:37.758
- Break up
with him right now.

07:37.825 --> 07:39.593
- He's cute.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.194
- I think
I'm gonna go, okay?

07:41.261 --> 07:49.202
See ya later.
- Okay.

07:49.269 --> 07:49.870
- Okay, so now
that we have an idea,

07:49.937 --> 07:51.539
we need a location.

07:51.605 --> 07:52.740
- We could shoot at
my parents' house.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.941
- I got the best
idea for the location.

07:54.007 --> 07:54.775
- What?

07:55.643 --> 07:56.710
- Alright, do you guys remember

07:56.777 --> 07:57.144
that Halloween fright
farm in Mullica Hill?

07:57.210 --> 07:57.745
- Yes.

07:57.811 --> 07:58.746
- Creamy Acres?

07:58.812 --> 08:00.614
- Yeah,
yeah, what about it?

08:00.681 --> 08:01.448
- I think that would be

08:01.515 --> 08:02.650
the best place to shoot this.

08:02.716 --> 08:03.684
- They're not
gonna let us shoot there.

08:03.751 --> 08:05.986
- I
could talk to them.

08:06.053 --> 08:06.754
They'll have a hard
time saying no to me.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.857
- Yeah, no,
no worries there.

08:09.923 --> 08:10.958
It's closed for the
winter so it's empty.

08:11.024 --> 08:11.825
- Yeah, well the place is like

08:11.892 --> 08:13.794
a Hollywood backlot for horror.

08:13.861 --> 08:14.928
It's great.
It's a great job, man.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.163
- Thank you.

08:16.229 --> 08:17.731
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

08:17.798 --> 08:19.567
- Oh hi, Nicole.
- Hey.

08:19.633 --> 08:20.968
- We're going to Creamy
Acres to shoot a movie.

08:21.034 --> 08:22.870
- And I'm going to star in it.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.572
- Actually we haven't
cast any parts yet.

08:24.638 --> 08:25.973
- I
deserve to star in it.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.541
After all, it is my calling.

08:28.709 --> 08:29.943
- I wish we
were doing a love story.

08:32.312 --> 08:33.647
- And who are you?

08:34.414 --> 08:35.315
- Oh,
I'm Holly Monroe.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.585
I had my mom change
my birth name

08:37.650 --> 08:39.251
to the actress I
model my life after.

08:40.688 --> 08:43.591
The only thing is, Marilyn
wasn't a filmmaker.

08:43.657 --> 08:47.628
So I thought if I went to film
school I could write, direct,

08:48.428 --> 08:52.532
produce, and yes,
star in my own movies.

08:52.766 --> 08:53.801
- Mmhmm.

08:54.668 --> 08:55.535
I'm Nicole.

08:55.969 --> 08:56.870
- Do you think I'm pretty?

08:56.937 --> 08:58.606
- Holly,

08:59.339 --> 09:01.642
beauty is in the soul.

09:02.075 --> 09:04.544
It's what's on the inside

09:05.312 --> 09:07.247
that truly determines
our outer glow.

09:07.314 --> 09:08.716
- Right on, sister.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.886
Lizzie, I'll see you
back at the apartment. Okay?

09:12.953 --> 09:14.221
That okay?
- Okay.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.789
- Alright.
- Bye, Nicole!

09:15.856 --> 09:17.024
- Bye.

09:17.090 --> 09:18.291
Bye, Johnny.

09:18.358 --> 09:19.760
- Darren.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.561
Now about that part...

09:23.964 --> 09:24.832
- Wait, Nicole!

09:25.365 --> 09:26.834
I'm coming with you.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.317
- Okay, kiddies,
who's ready to make a movie?

09:44.384 --> 09:46.286
- Yeah.

09:46.353 --> 09:49.322
Alright, uh, please state
your full name for the camera.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.692
- My name
is Nicole Hart,

09:51.759 --> 09:54.061
and I've joined this
crazy group of filmmakers

09:54.127 --> 09:56.263
on a journey in
intellectual curiosity.

09:57.497 --> 10:00.367
It was my best friend Lizzie
Davis who made me do it.

10:00.433 --> 10:03.971
She manipulated me doing a
series of adorable gestures.

10:04.738 --> 10:06.039
- Guilty.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.909
- Johnny, I
have something to say.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.878
That's much better.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.080
I've always felt more comfortable
in front of the camera.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.948
You see my name is Holly Monroe

10:16.016 --> 10:17.751
and I'm what you'd
call a power woman.

10:18.752 --> 10:19.519
- Okay, Johnny,
you should document

10:19.586 --> 10:20.587
the making of this film, man.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.289
- I would
if I had enough crew.

10:22.355 --> 10:23.824
- Johnny, you should
make a documentary

10:24.424 --> 10:25.793
about my rise to stardom.

10:30.831 --> 10:32.399
I always smoke when
I take long drives.

10:32.465 --> 10:33.767
Helps pass the time.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.402
Here, babe.

10:43.443 --> 10:44.444
- I don't
like to smoke usually,

10:44.511 --> 10:46.747
but I guess this is
a special occasion.

10:47.380 --> 10:49.917
Because it makes me so hungry.

10:52.820 --> 10:54.454
And you know I'm trying
to watch my calories

10:54.521 --> 10:56.423
because you know the
camera adds 10 pounds.

11:09.202 --> 11:10.403
- Score!

11:10.470 --> 11:11.071
- You alright there?

11:11.138 --> 11:12.672
- It's been awhile.

11:14.842 --> 11:15.876
- Yo, Johnny,
I want that tape, man.

11:15.943 --> 11:17.144
- You got it, man.

11:17.210 --> 11:18.011
- No, erase that.

11:18.078 --> 11:20.013
Right now.

11:20.080 --> 11:21.815
- That's right,
blackmail us with that footage.

11:21.882 --> 11:22.916
- Ah, that's
Johnny "Handheld" Thompson.

11:22.983 --> 11:23.951
He'll never do that.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.385
- I might.
- Nuh-uh.

11:25.452 --> 11:26.219
- Nuh-uh.

11:26.286 --> 11:36.429
- Are we almost there?

11:36.496 --> 11:51.178
- Are we almost there?

11:58.118 --> 12:00.187
- You're
a terrible boy!

12:00.253 --> 12:03.390
Wretched, putrid monster!

12:04.958 --> 12:06.026
You hear me?

12:06.994 --> 12:08.128
Do you hear what I'm sayin'?

12:08.195 --> 12:10.097
You make me sick!

12:12.465 --> 12:13.867
Why do you treat me like this?

12:13.934 --> 12:15.068
Why?

12:20.007 --> 12:20.941
You're disgusting!

12:21.574 --> 12:22.475
You're filth, you're trash!

12:22.542 --> 12:23.877
You ain't nothing!

12:24.144 --> 12:25.445
You hear me?

12:26.279 --> 12:27.214
You ain't never
gonna be nothing!

12:27.280 --> 12:28.748
You're just disgusting!

12:29.149 --> 12:30.050
Why?

12:31.084 --> 12:34.021
Why do you do this to me?

12:34.087 --> 12:36.023
Your man parts
should be cut off!

12:36.089 --> 12:37.024
You hear me?

12:47.300 --> 12:48.902
- Man.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.239
- You see those
vultures up there?

12:52.305 --> 12:53.540
- I see them.

12:54.574 --> 12:56.243
They're waiting for something.

12:56.309 --> 13:00.513
- They eat dead things.

13:00.580 --> 13:01.381
- You know
I've been thinking

13:01.448 --> 13:03.516
about what you said about Darren

13:03.583 --> 13:04.751
and I really think you should--

13:04.818 --> 13:06.854
- Nicole, I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

13:06.920 --> 13:07.554
- Save yourself for someone
who really loves you.

13:07.620 --> 13:08.889
- You don't know him.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.259
There's a side of him
that you haven't seen yet.

13:12.325 --> 13:13.927
- Mmm.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.864
- Like when he was little,
his dad used to say

13:16.930 --> 13:20.133
he was going to pick
him up and never did.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.002
His parents are
divorced, you know.

13:24.271 --> 13:26.606
He's trying, he just
has trouble trusting.

13:26.673 --> 13:28.876
- I get it, but as
far as I'm concerned,

13:28.942 --> 13:31.011
he has much to prove to
me to be worthy of you.

13:31.544 --> 13:33.080
- Please, Nicole.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.116
I need you to like him.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.820
He's cute.
- Shut up.

13:41.588 --> 13:44.657
Look at that.

13:44.724 --> 13:46.894
- This place is creepy.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.661
We should probably try
to catch up to them.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.931
I don't want to get lost here.
- Yeah, me neither.

13:50.998 --> 13:51.598
- Come on.
- This is really heavy.

13:51.664 --> 13:53.266
It's hurting my arm.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.568
- It's okay, Holly.
We'll get there.

13:56.236 --> 13:57.570
- Oh, what the fuck?

13:57.637 --> 13:59.172
- At least
this is good lighting.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.208
- Beautiful.

14:01.274 --> 14:02.976
- I'm gonna
look so pretty in it.

14:18.391 --> 14:20.527
- Holly, please relax.

14:20.593 --> 14:24.331
- That would be good.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.632
So what did I tell you guys?

14:25.698 --> 14:29.202
Is this place awesome or what?

14:29.269 --> 14:32.172
Well I'm very glad
we found this.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.640
- These girls are
truly gonna know

14:33.706 --> 14:34.574
what guerrilla filmmaking's
all about.

14:34.641 --> 14:35.608
- You're telling me.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.710
So have you come up
with a title yet?

14:37.777 --> 14:39.012
- I'm just gonna
throw this out there.

14:39.079 --> 14:39.879
- Hmm?

14:40.280 --> 14:41.148
- Familiar Stranger.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.715
- I like it.

14:42.782 --> 14:43.183
I like it, it's
got a ring to it.

14:43.250 --> 14:44.184
- Yeah?

14:45.152 --> 14:46.353
- Why do I have
to carry anything?

14:46.419 --> 14:47.887
I'm a star.

14:48.621 --> 14:49.722
- We have to work together.

14:49.789 --> 14:53.093
If we work together,
it'll be easier on us all.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.028
- God.

14:55.428 --> 14:57.130
I need an assistant.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.365
- Got the hangman thing going.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.133
Got a fuckin' thing dead

15:00.200 --> 15:02.269
and fuckin' people in there
in this like boardhouse.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.139
It looks like someone built
this house in two days.

15:06.206 --> 15:07.274
Could happen.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.378
Dude, look!

15:11.444 --> 15:12.579
A fuckin' pirate ship!

15:13.713 --> 15:15.015
What is that?

15:15.082 --> 15:16.216
- Oh my god.

15:16.283 --> 15:17.650
Dude, that's gonna look great.

15:17.717 --> 15:21.254
Goonies!

15:21.321 --> 15:22.755
- I'll show her
my one-eyed willy.

15:24.191 --> 15:27.027
- Girlfriend.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.062
- Oh man, alright.

15:32.132 --> 15:33.233
Let's keep movin'.

15:35.135 --> 15:38.338
- Ugh!

15:38.405 --> 15:39.306
This is so--

15:39.372 --> 15:41.641
- Skeletons.

15:41.708 --> 15:43.043
Ugh, we've got some crates.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.245
We're gonna string
together the best

15:46.346 --> 15:48.181
nonsensical story ever created.

15:48.248 --> 15:50.617
- Donovan's gonna be
like, "Shit, this is amazing!"

15:51.218 --> 15:52.619
- Right?

15:53.720 --> 15:54.587
- He's gonna blow his
load over our movie.

15:54.654 --> 15:55.188
- That's,
alright, well.

15:56.856 --> 15:59.159
- Oh wow.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.327
- God, these are
just not the right shoes.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.195
- Look at this, look at this.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.297
Look.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.132
- Wow.

16:05.765 --> 16:06.699
- Alright, alright.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.035
Now let's stop here.

16:09.069 --> 16:10.437
This will protect us
from the elements.

16:10.503 --> 16:13.106
- I'll keep you warm.

16:13.173 --> 16:13.873
Just make sure you always
shoot me from the right.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.109
It's my much better side.

16:17.377 --> 16:18.711
- Is this bitch for real?

16:20.513 --> 16:21.448
- So, how do you
guys like the place?

16:21.514 --> 16:23.450
- Great location.

16:23.516 --> 16:24.084
- If you're going
to shoot a horror film,

16:24.151 --> 16:25.185
this would be it.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.254
- Uh, which brings me
to my next question.

16:28.255 --> 16:31.024
Uh, Nicole, um, I know
you're not an actress,

16:31.858 --> 16:34.294
uh, but, you know, you
have this real beauty

16:35.195 --> 16:36.229
and style about you--

16:36.296 --> 16:37.064
- Johnny, I'm
not someone you have

16:37.130 --> 16:38.265
to beat around the bush with.

16:38.331 --> 16:40.467
If you want me to be in
your movie, just say it.

16:40.533 --> 16:42.102
- You mean you'll do it?

16:43.736 --> 16:44.771
- For you, yes, I will.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.339
- Thank you, Nicole.

16:46.406 --> 16:47.840
You know, you really
are beautiful.

16:47.907 --> 16:49.076
- I said I'd be in the movie.

16:49.142 --> 16:50.110
Don't push it.

16:50.177 --> 16:51.144
- Okay, okay.

16:51.211 --> 16:52.212
Dude, she's in.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.247
- Oh, that's great man.

16:54.314 --> 16:55.415
You sure there's no one here?

16:55.482 --> 16:57.084
- Yeah, dude, it's empty.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.718
Why is everyone
so scared of that?

16:59.819 --> 17:00.853
Come on, look at this place.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.355
It's a filmmaker's dream.

17:02.422 --> 17:03.390
Yeah, yeah, I know,
I just don't want

17:03.456 --> 17:05.125
anyone fuckin' up our shoot.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.060
This one will be my magnum opus.

17:21.241 --> 17:24.042
- Yeah.

17:24.277 --> 17:25.044
- What?

17:26.113 --> 17:37.157
- That's that, that's
that guy McInnes.

17:37.224 --> 17:38.458
- What
will it be, John?

17:38.525 --> 17:39.359
- Beer.

17:40.360 --> 17:47.334
- Shelly, can I have
a beer for John?

17:47.400 --> 17:49.068
Enjoy, Johnny.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.309
- Hey, buddy.

17:57.477 --> 17:58.345
You're that guy.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.080
- What guy is that?

18:01.414 --> 18:04.317
- You're that cop.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.218
- I was a cop.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.920
- What happened?

18:07.987 --> 18:09.822
- Retired.

18:09.889 --> 18:11.491
Or they retired me.

18:11.558 --> 18:13.426
Yeah, you're the guy

18:13.493 --> 18:16.095
that was chasin' down the guy
that killed all those women.

18:16.496 --> 18:17.830
- Yeah, that was me.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.199
- I knew it.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.335
I never forget a face.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.207
But let me ask you a question.

18:27.907 --> 18:32.345
How did it feel
when you caught him?

18:32.412 --> 18:34.181
- We never caught the real guy.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.883
- What
about the newspapers?

18:36.949 --> 18:39.852
- Can't believe
everything you read.

18:39.919 --> 18:43.590
What do you believe in?

18:43.656 --> 18:47.227
- You know what I believe in?

18:47.294 --> 18:48.861
I believe in God.

18:48.928 --> 18:52.965
I believe in family.

18:53.032 --> 18:57.504
And I believe there's a place
in hell for serial killers.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.272
- Let's have a drink
together, me and you.

19:01.541 --> 19:04.977
- Here's to my new best friend.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.917
- Okay, kid, you
have to understand.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.353
This place is filled
with strong egos.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.288
Sometimes you gotta remind
them who's in charge.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.163
Angelice, you think
this is a rest home?

19:24.697 --> 19:26.299
Get your fuckin'
feet off the desk!

19:26.899 --> 19:27.400
Giddy up, motherfucker.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.001
Do somethin'!

19:29.068 --> 19:30.403
- Captain, why you
always breakin' my balls?

19:30.470 --> 19:31.371
- 'Cause it's fun.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.374
You, keep your eye on him.

19:34.441 --> 19:35.542
- You got it, Captain!

19:41.981 --> 19:44.451
- Gentlemen, I'm
showin' the kid the ropes.

19:45.618 --> 19:47.854
- Aw, ain't that sweet?

19:48.688 --> 19:50.423
And who's gonna show
you the ropes, Cap?

19:52.091 --> 19:53.025
- Is that insubordination
I just heard?

19:53.092 --> 19:55.462
- Sounds like he
was kidding, Edward.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.230
- Don't be such a sourpuss.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.033
Didn't I get you a gift
when you made Captain?

20:01.100 --> 20:02.535
- You
see, what Captain Links here

20:02.602 --> 20:03.970
neglected to tell you was that

20:05.004 --> 20:06.873
Mansfield and I have
been detectives since he

20:06.939 --> 20:08.541
was wearing a blue uniform
and walkin' a beat.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.978
- You two
are pains in my ass.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.580
- Speaking
of pains in the ass,

20:13.646 --> 20:15.348
how are those hemorrhoids, Cap?

20:17.650 --> 20:19.486
- About as big
as your fuckin' ugly head.

20:19.552 --> 20:21.254
- Ooh.

20:22.121 --> 20:22.922
- So, what's it like
being the Captain's bitch?

20:22.989 --> 20:25.258
- Leave the kid alone, will ya?

20:25.625 --> 20:26.693
Voight, let's go.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.461
These two are hopeless.

20:28.528 --> 20:29.796
- I'm tellin' ya,

20:29.862 --> 20:30.430
you're gonna wake up one
mornin' and have a baboon's ass.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.033
- Cap, you got a phone call.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.067
- Who is it?

20:35.134 --> 20:37.236
- It's Cherry Hill
P.D. Captain Eason.

20:38.037 --> 20:39.038
- I'll
take it in my office.

20:44.043 --> 20:46.245
Make sure you shut that door.

20:48.515 --> 20:49.916
Have a seat, kid.

20:51.718 --> 20:53.386
Yeah, this is Captain Links.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.054
- We got
a Detective McInnes

20:55.121 --> 20:56.923
calling over here
regarding a murder victim.

20:58.157 --> 20:59.526
- Tell me, is there a problem?

21:00.460 --> 21:01.494
- No,
I was just calling

21:01.561 --> 21:02.562
to confirm he was with you.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.096
- Yeah,
he's one of mine.

21:04.163 --> 21:05.665
What did he want to know?

21:05.732 --> 21:06.599
- He
asked if the victim

21:06.666 --> 21:08.401
was raped post-mortem.

21:08.468 --> 21:09.302
- I see.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.105
Anything else I
can help you with?

21:13.172 --> 21:13.573
- No,
Captain, we're all good.

21:19.178 --> 21:21.381
Tell me, what do you know
about the Corpse Collector case

21:21.781 --> 21:24.417
from five years ago?

21:27.787 --> 21:30.357
- So fucking cold out here.

23:33.780 --> 23:36.115
At the time I was
newly appointed.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.885
Lots of pressure from City
Hall to find this guy.

23:38.951 --> 23:41.721
One night, guy walks in,
confesses to everything.

23:42.689 --> 23:43.790
All my problems are solved.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.125
Except for one small thing.

23:46.192 --> 23:48.094
- What's that, sir?

23:49.596 --> 23:50.630
- John McInnes.

23:55.602 --> 24:06.913
This is your guy.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.115
John, he made a full confession.

24:09.181 --> 24:10.717
- You just want to
please the public.

24:10.783 --> 24:11.651
- You think that?

24:12.619 --> 24:13.786
I got a confession,
you got shit.

24:15.655 --> 24:17.123
You got nothin'.

24:17.757 --> 24:19.191
John, look at your desk.

24:20.693 --> 24:22.294
You ever hear of a
fuckin' computer?

24:22.361 --> 24:23.863
Why don't you join
the 21st century?

24:23.930 --> 24:25.632
- Go fuck yourself.

24:26.766 --> 24:28.668
- Mac was
workin' the case for me.

24:28.735 --> 24:29.736
He was sure he had the guy.

24:30.803 --> 24:32.238
Black guy named Harrison Graves.

24:32.304 --> 24:34.240
Even I thought
the fucker did it.

24:35.942 --> 24:37.610
And then comes Charlie Booker.

24:38.277 --> 24:41.247
- Good evening, Mr. Booker.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.215
My name's Kevin Mitchell and
I'm your public defender.

24:43.282 --> 24:45.685
The detectives tell me
that you waived your right

24:46.352 --> 24:47.787
to counsel and gave a statement.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.957
- Yes, I did.

24:51.023 --> 24:51.591
- In fact, they tell me
you're takin' ownership

24:51.658 --> 24:52.825
of 15 dead bodies.

24:54.894 --> 24:56.495
- I killed them all.

24:57.630 --> 24:59.666
- Mr. Booker, I certainly
hope that's not true

24:59.732 --> 25:00.767
because if it is, you're
almost certainly looking

25:00.833 --> 25:02.501
at the death penalty.

25:03.035 --> 25:04.837
- John, it ain't worth it.

25:04.904 --> 25:05.738
Let it go, man.

25:06.739 --> 25:07.840
- This
is about a month

25:07.907 --> 25:08.841
after Mac lost his kid.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.844
I let him stay on the case.

25:11.911 --> 25:16.949
I thought it would distract him.

25:17.016 --> 25:18.951
Mac was never the
same after that.

25:37.904 --> 25:40.339
- I'm not sure that was
a good idea.

25:40.406 --> 25:42.308
Give me another.

25:43.075 --> 25:46.245
What, you're not gonna give me

25:46.946 --> 25:47.980
another fuckin' drink or what?

25:48.047 --> 25:49.882
- Wouldn't it be best
if you slowed down?

25:49.949 --> 25:51.217
Got your car here, Johnny?

25:52.719 --> 25:54.286
- You
sound like my ex.

25:54.353 --> 25:55.955
That's why I got rid of her.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.390
- That's not what
happened, John.

25:58.457 --> 26:02.361
- You're my bartender,
not my therapist.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.897
Give me another drink ,
you Irish bastard.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.866
- Don't you lay your hands
on me in my fuckin' bar.

26:06.933 --> 26:07.767
I'm cutting you off.
- Fuck it.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.769
- I'm cutting...
Give me that.

26:09.836 --> 26:10.937
- Don't you--
I'm cutting you off.

26:11.003 --> 26:11.971
- Yeah, I'll fuckin'
beat the fuck out of you!

26:12.038 --> 26:12.905
- Don't
you do this, John.

26:12.972 --> 26:14.874
Don't you do this.
Give me that.

26:14.941 --> 26:15.708
- Ha!

26:16.042 --> 26:17.043
Motherfucker.

26:17.109 --> 26:18.044
- You motherfucker.

26:18.110 --> 26:18.845
- Ha!

26:19.812 --> 26:21.681
- Get the fuck out
of my bar, John.

26:27.119 --> 26:27.920
Get the fuck out of
here, you fuckin' drunk!

26:27.987 --> 26:29.889
Get out of here!

26:30.757 --> 26:33.693
Don't drive.

26:33.760 --> 26:34.593
Fucker!

26:59.752 --> 27:01.888
- I'm so sorry.

27:22.441 --> 27:25.745
- Tonight is the night.

27:25.812 --> 27:27.646
- Why do you feel so
compelled to be with him?

27:28.414 --> 27:30.950
What's the rush?

27:31.550 --> 27:32.919
Hmm?

27:33.452 --> 27:36.488
- A man has needs.

27:36.555 --> 27:38.424
And Darren says that a
good girlfriend's job

27:38.490 --> 27:39.992
is to make sure
those needs are met.

27:40.059 --> 27:41.794
- Oh he does, does he?

27:42.461 --> 27:44.797
What about what a woman wants?

27:44.864 --> 27:46.799
- Why do you have to be so
analytical about everything?

27:46.866 --> 27:48.901
Have some fun!

27:50.970 --> 27:53.072
Plus, I know Johnny has
a little crush on you.

27:53.139 --> 27:54.741
- Oh, Johnny.

27:54.807 --> 27:55.775
That boy wouldn't know what

27:55.842 --> 27:57.777
to do with me even
if I was interested.

27:59.011 --> 28:02.749
Plus it's, um, it's been
a little while for me.

28:03.482 --> 28:05.752
- Hang out with him
tonight and see.

28:06.218 --> 28:07.153
He really is sweet.

28:07.219 --> 28:08.821
- Whatever.

28:09.588 --> 28:11.690
You just promise me
not to do anything

28:12.491 --> 28:13.960
just because Darren
wants you to.

28:15.594 --> 28:17.429
You have to want to do it.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.366
- I don't know why
you don't like him.

28:20.432 --> 28:21.901
- It's not
that I don't like him.

28:21.968 --> 28:23.369
He's cool and all.

28:24.603 --> 28:26.973
I just see him in
a different light.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.975
He uses his ego to make
decisions and I don't think

28:30.009 --> 28:32.144
he treats you the way
you need to be treated.

28:32.211 --> 28:33.913
- I know you're
worried about me.

28:33.980 --> 28:35.014
- Mmhmm.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.185
- But do you think this
could be something else?

28:39.251 --> 28:40.853
- Like what?

28:42.254 --> 28:44.056
- Well, it could go
back to that story you told me.

28:44.123 --> 28:46.759
About your sister.

28:49.528 --> 28:50.897
- I don't want to
talk about that.

28:50.963 --> 28:51.964
- Come on!

28:52.031 --> 28:53.966
It's okay for me to
tell you everything

28:54.033 --> 28:55.802
and you won't even entertain
that this could definitely

28:55.868 --> 28:56.502
have something to do with that.

28:56.568 --> 28:57.736
- You know what, fine.

28:57.804 --> 28:58.805
If you want to cheapen
yourself and be with someone

28:58.871 --> 29:01.440
who doesn't deserve
you, that's on you.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.945
- That was
wrong of you to say.

29:06.578 --> 29:07.880
What you say affects me!

29:12.985 --> 29:15.087
- Why do we
have to scout this?

29:15.154 --> 29:16.488
- We're part of a team.

29:17.957 --> 29:18.958
Darren needs us to.

29:27.166 --> 29:29.869
- That thing is creepy.

29:29.936 --> 29:33.005
- It almost looks like a real
person could be in there.

29:33.072 --> 29:33.973
Ugh.

29:35.274 --> 29:37.844
I will say this place
definitely has a darkness to it.

29:45.617 --> 29:46.953
- Ugh!

29:50.189 --> 29:51.523
Never was good at sports.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.525
- You know, neither was I.

29:58.264 --> 29:59.631
- Let's go.

29:59.698 --> 30:00.867
I want to get back to shooting.

30:00.933 --> 30:02.034
- Okay.

30:02.101 --> 30:04.503
- So do you think I'll
be a big star some day?

30:07.339 --> 30:09.942
- I think you
should follow your dreams.

30:18.284 --> 30:19.518
- I'm sorry.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.620
You were right.

30:21.687 --> 30:23.255
It's your life and I just
want you to be happy.

30:23.322 --> 30:25.157
- Thank you.

30:30.262 --> 30:32.164
- Okay, now that we're set up,

30:32.231 --> 30:34.166
let's continue the wondrous
process of creating cinema.

30:34.233 --> 30:35.935
- Uh, do you want me to
take this off sticks? I could--

30:36.002 --> 30:37.103
- No, no, no, no.

30:37.169 --> 30:39.305
In this shot we're
composing inside the frame.

30:39.371 --> 30:40.940
- I'm ready for my
closeup, Mr. DeMille.

30:41.007 --> 30:42.942
- Yes,
Sunset Boulevard.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.544
Paid attention in film class.

30:46.112 --> 30:47.113
Good girl.

30:50.716 --> 30:53.219
- This is Familiar Stranger,
scene four, take 20.

30:59.758 --> 31:01.527
- I'm so sorry, it just slipped.

31:01.994 --> 31:02.528
- Ugh.

31:03.129 --> 31:04.196
Watch that thing.

31:06.665 --> 31:08.067
- Is everyone ready?

31:08.134 --> 31:10.036
Quiet on the set!

31:12.271 --> 31:14.006
- Dude, there's no one here.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.008
- Quiet on the set!

31:17.676 --> 31:19.111
Camera's rolling!

31:21.413 --> 31:22.214
Action!

31:36.095 --> 31:38.897
Cut, cut, cut!

31:40.199 --> 31:41.167
Just stop the camera.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.201
Stop it.

31:43.102 --> 31:49.141
I need time to think.

31:49.208 --> 31:51.277
Kait, did you tell
everyone to come tonight?

31:51.343 --> 31:53.679
- Yeah, I posted it on Facebook.

31:53.745 --> 31:55.281
That we're making a
movie, so there should be

31:55.347 --> 31:57.183
a bunch of people here
in about four hours.

32:02.121 --> 32:03.990
- Alright, just
cut the camera off.

32:04.056 --> 32:08.094
Gonna break till
the party scene.

32:08.160 --> 32:09.228
- I'm good.

33:33.879 --> 33:36.315
- Holly, this place
is really weird.

34:10.516 --> 34:17.356
- Yo, hey, Johnny, you
gotta see this, man.

34:17.422 --> 34:18.357
Johnny!

34:19.391 --> 34:21.327
- Can you guys hear me?
- Huh?

34:21.393 --> 34:22.360
Holly?

34:23.594 --> 34:26.498
- Where are you guys?

34:26.565 --> 34:27.433
- Nicole?

34:33.605 --> 34:35.141
- Johnny!

34:35.541 --> 34:45.516
- Yo, Darren!

34:45.583 --> 34:53.925
- Yo, Darren!

34:53.992 --> 34:55.092
- Hello?

35:03.969 --> 35:05.304
Can you guys hear me?

35:05.571 --> 35:07.206
- Holly!

35:07.606 --> 35:08.840
Where are you?

35:17.316 --> 35:18.250
- Oh my god!

35:18.650 --> 35:20.118
- That's gross!

35:20.619 --> 35:21.453
- What?

35:21.520 --> 35:22.454
- Ugh!

35:22.521 --> 35:23.088
- That's gross!

35:23.989 --> 35:25.291
- We can use that in my film!

35:25.357 --> 35:26.392
- Ugh, no, you know what kind
of germs those things carry?

35:26.458 --> 35:28.860
- What do you think
happened to that deer?

35:28.927 --> 35:30.529
- Have you ever heard
of the chupacabra?

35:30.596 --> 35:32.331
- No.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.266
What's that?

35:34.333 --> 35:35.867
- It's a creature
that's been spotted

35:35.934 --> 35:36.935
on farms just like this one.

35:37.002 --> 35:39.371
Affectionately known
as the goat-sucker,

35:39.438 --> 35:42.408
it's known for attacking livestock
and drinking their blood.

35:43.542 --> 35:46.345
Specifically goats, but I guess
this time it chose a deer.

35:46.412 --> 35:48.414
- Stop scaring her.

35:48.480 --> 35:50.982
The chupacabra is only
found in the Southwest.

35:51.049 --> 35:53.219
I think we're safe from that
creature here, honey, okay?

35:53.285 --> 35:54.820
Now the Jersey Devil,
that's a different story.

35:57.289 --> 35:58.424
- Wait, how
do you know about that?

35:58.490 --> 35:59.225
- I watch the
History Channel, you know.

35:59.291 --> 36:01.493
- A girl after my own heart.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.395
Lizzie, you never told me.

36:03.462 --> 36:04.496
- Nice try, Johnny, but mmm-mmm.

36:04.563 --> 36:06.332
This is disgusting.

36:06.932 --> 36:08.166
Whoo, let's go!

36:09.468 --> 36:11.570
- I'm gonna get my GoPro and
we're gonna come back out

36:11.637 --> 36:12.438
and we're gonna shoot
this fuckin' thing.

36:14.406 --> 36:14.906
- So disgusting!

36:14.973 --> 36:15.974
- I feel bad.

36:16.041 --> 36:24.416
- Oh, it's gonna look
great.

36:32.924 --> 36:35.227
- Hey, baby.

36:35.727 --> 36:37.963
You lookin' for some company?

36:38.029 --> 36:39.531
- Keep walkin', you
don't want any of this.

36:39.598 --> 36:41.267
- I want you to be my daddy.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.269
- Mmm?

36:44.069 --> 36:44.936
- I'll make you
feel really good.

36:48.740 --> 36:49.941
And I'll be a good baby.

37:01.587 --> 37:02.321
What, you don't like Pepsi?

37:02.388 --> 37:03.322
- Stop.

37:03.655 --> 37:04.290
- Hmm?

37:05.491 --> 37:07.293
- Is that your real name?

37:07.359 --> 37:09.328
- Yes,
because I taste so good.

37:13.732 --> 37:15.000
You don't like me, huh?

37:21.139 --> 37:30.616
I knew there was
somethin' wrong with you.

37:37.055 --> 37:38.324
♪ When a girl walks
in with an itty bitty waist

37:38.390 --> 37:39.658
♪ And a round thing in
your face, you get sprung ♪

38:02.414 --> 38:03.515
- Please, please let go of it.

38:03.582 --> 38:04.583
No, no, no, no.

38:38.484 --> 38:39.150
- Are you okay?

38:39.217 --> 38:40.018
- Yeah.

38:57.736 --> 39:00.472
- Say Darren, Darren!

39:01.206 --> 39:03.709
- Darren,
Darren, Darren,

39:04.710 --> 39:06.645
Darren, Darren, Darren, Darren!

39:07.846 --> 39:10.649
- And who's the star
of your movie but Holly Monroe!

39:11.483 --> 39:14.019
Holly, Holly, Holly, Holly!

39:15.220 --> 39:17.389
- Darren, Darren,
Darren, Darren, Darren, Darren!

39:31.169 --> 39:33.071
- I decided that
tonight is your night.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.043
- Really?

39:38.644 --> 39:40.078
After all this time?

40:44.576 --> 40:45.644
- I love you.

41:04.663 --> 41:06.464
- That was awesome.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.605
- I feel so connected to you.

41:15.774 --> 41:16.742
- Yeah, that was great.

41:20.278 --> 41:35.193
- Do you feel the connection?

42:21.673 --> 42:23.675
- Guys, I
can't find my iPhone.

42:29.314 --> 42:30.849
- Mine is gone too.

42:33.351 --> 42:35.621
- Where is
everyone from the party?

42:35.687 --> 42:36.855
- They must've stolen
our cellphones.

42:36.922 --> 42:37.555
- Who?

42:38.323 --> 42:39.858
- Someone from the party.

42:42.093 --> 42:43.762
- Alright, mine's
gone too, guys.

42:44.362 --> 42:45.964
We gotta get back to school.

42:46.031 --> 42:47.733
Come on, wrap it up.

42:47.799 --> 42:48.934
Lizzie, I told you I had
to study this weekend.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.368
- Sorry.

42:50.435 --> 42:52.037
- I didn't come here
to lose my phone.

42:52.103 --> 42:53.905
- Yeah, I have
photos on my phone.

42:53.972 --> 42:55.907
I can't have people just see
those photos on my phone!

42:55.974 --> 42:57.042
They're not for everybody!

43:00.846 --> 43:01.913
- Hey!

43:01.980 --> 43:02.781
Hey!

43:03.615 --> 43:04.816
Hey, wait a second, calm down!

43:08.486 --> 43:09.821
Listen...

43:11.489 --> 43:13.324
I know we're too
young to remember,

43:14.392 --> 43:16.662
but there was a time when
there was no cell phones

43:16.728 --> 43:18.930
and a group of hungry
filmmakers went out

43:20.098 --> 43:23.301
and focused and made a
movie and created art.

43:26.037 --> 43:28.740
Yeah, we could quit,
we could go home,

43:30.842 --> 43:32.744
and that's what they
would expect us to do.

43:35.480 --> 43:39.350
And we probably wouldn't
be wrong to do so.

43:39.417 --> 43:41.319
However, I believe that
each and every one of you

43:42.087 --> 43:43.922
has a fire burning
deep inside them

43:44.890 --> 43:46.024
to create something special.

43:46.091 --> 43:47.826
Something great.

43:49.160 --> 43:52.898
Despite the setbacks
or the odds.

43:55.834 --> 43:57.803
- That was one hell of a speech.

43:59.437 --> 44:01.406
So I guess everybody
wants to stay?

44:02.173 --> 44:03.875
- We can
make this movie.

44:03.942 --> 44:05.777
- We can make this movie.

44:07.913 --> 44:09.447
- Come on,
Nicole, that was inspiring.

44:09.514 --> 44:10.381
- It's
inspiring because it's--

44:10.448 --> 44:11.717
- That was amazing!

44:13.051 --> 44:14.720
- I saw Copolla give that speech

44:14.786 --> 44:15.887
on the behind the scenes
of Apocalypse Now.

44:15.954 --> 44:16.888
It's all I had.

44:16.955 --> 44:17.889
- It worked, bro.

44:19.357 --> 44:25.663
- Darren, you are so talented
and such an amazing director.

44:26.564 --> 44:28.033
I was just wondering
if you could use me

44:28.967 --> 44:30.668
in this scene in any way?

44:31.970 --> 44:34.005
- Holly, this is the scene,
uh, where Nicole realizes

44:34.973 --> 44:36.507
who the familiar stranger is.

44:36.574 --> 44:37.675
Your scene will
be shot tomorrow.

44:37.743 --> 44:39.945
If you could just hang
around and help Lizzie,

44:40.011 --> 44:41.012
that would be great.

44:41.079 --> 44:42.748
- Fine.

44:51.222 --> 44:53.391
- Shit.

44:53.458 --> 44:54.926
- One of the coldest
winters in years.

44:54.993 --> 44:55.961
- Fuck yeah.

44:57.562 --> 44:59.030
- Voight, go get us some coffee.

45:00.498 --> 45:02.801
Right over there, by
the train entrance.

45:03.101 --> 45:04.435
- Okay.

45:18.116 --> 45:18.917
- Hello?

45:19.885 --> 45:20.651
It's Captain Eason

45:20.718 --> 45:21.486
over here at Cherry Hill P.D.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.488
- Yeah, what can I do for you?

45:23.554 --> 45:24.990
- Your
guy, he came back.

45:25.623 --> 45:27.793
- What's he lookin' for now?

45:27.859 --> 45:30.095
- He told me
you gave him authorization

45:30.161 --> 45:32.063
and consent to
catch this killer.

45:32.130 --> 45:33.865
Hold on, this is what he said:

45:34.866 --> 45:36.501
"Captain Links stands
behind all my--"

45:36.567 --> 45:38.403
- Do me a favor, Captain Eason.

45:39.537 --> 45:40.571
Just give me a call if
he needs anything else.

45:40.638 --> 45:42.440
- Sure thing.

45:42.507 --> 45:43.942
It's good to know you
stand behind your people.

45:44.009 --> 45:45.110
- Thank you.

45:56.154 --> 45:57.488
- Here you go.

46:04.195 --> 46:06.097
What's wrong, Cap?

46:06.164 --> 46:07.032
- You're not gonna fuckin'
believe who just called me.

46:07.098 --> 46:08.199
- Who?

46:08.266 --> 46:09.935
- Cherry Hill P.D.

46:10.001 --> 46:10.969
Mac is at it again.

46:11.302 --> 46:12.603
Crazy fuck.

46:12.670 --> 46:14.105
- God, what he do this time?

46:14.172 --> 46:16.007
- Fuckin' won't give up.

46:16.607 --> 46:18.443
Fired him five years ago.

46:19.978 --> 46:22.080
He was unstable after
Charlie Booker confessed

46:22.147 --> 46:24.049
to those fuckin' murders.

46:24.115 --> 46:26.217
I'll admit, there was a
point he was so convincing

46:26.284 --> 46:27.953
he led me to believe that

46:28.686 --> 46:30.455
this Harrison Graves
was the killer.

46:31.990 --> 46:33.124
How 'bout that?

46:33.191 --> 46:34.792
A black serial killer.

46:35.193 --> 46:36.995
Who ever heard of that?

46:37.062 --> 46:38.529
And this one, he looks like
a fuckin' underwear model.

46:41.066 --> 46:42.067
Yeah, it was clear.

46:43.234 --> 46:44.936
When Booker turned himself
in, he was our guy.

46:45.670 --> 46:50.075
- Captain, can I
ask you something?

46:50.341 --> 46:52.010
- Sure, kid.

46:52.944 --> 46:54.545
- Whatever happened
to McInnes' son?

46:59.217 --> 47:02.187
- We needed to find this guy,
so Mac was workin' long days

47:03.221 --> 47:04.923
following down
every lead he could.

47:06.624 --> 47:08.927
That winter his kid
Kyle got pneumonia.

47:09.727 --> 47:11.562
Mac was out talkin' to
some local informant

47:12.730 --> 47:14.933
who had some information about
one of the missing women.

47:15.666 --> 47:17.102
When Kyle's fever
rose to the point

47:18.403 --> 47:20.305
to where he needed to be
rushed to the emergency room,

47:20.371 --> 47:22.107
McInnes didn't make it in time.

47:24.109 --> 47:25.143
Kid Kyle went into shock.

47:26.577 --> 47:28.113
Died right there before
he was even admitted.

47:28.379 --> 47:29.647
- Fuck.

47:32.117 --> 47:34.585
- After that,
McInnes started drinking

47:34.652 --> 47:36.154
and him and his wife,
they just grew apart.

47:37.388 --> 47:39.190
He really blamed himself
for what happened.

47:40.325 --> 47:42.627
I think he blamed
me a little too.

47:42.693 --> 47:44.862
I had to let him go
when he wouldn't accept

47:45.263 --> 47:46.998
that Booker was our guy.

47:47.665 --> 47:49.200
- Whatever happened to Booker?

47:49.267 --> 47:50.601
- Booker, he got the chair.

47:50.668 --> 47:53.038
Justice was served.

47:53.638 --> 47:56.241
- You two were close?

47:56.307 --> 47:58.043
- What, it wasn't my fault.

47:58.376 --> 48:00.011
Shit happens.

48:00.778 --> 48:02.948
I can't keep cleanin'
up after him.

48:03.014 --> 48:05.050
He's gotta take responsibility.

48:06.084 --> 48:09.087
It took me years to
get to where I am

48:09.154 --> 48:12.657
and not him, or anyone
else, is gonna fuck that up.

48:12.723 --> 48:16.094
- Well, I found out
where he's staying.

48:16.727 --> 48:18.129
The sleazy motel on Route 73.

48:19.797 --> 48:20.731
- That fuckin' hooker motel?

48:20.798 --> 48:21.899
- Yup.

48:22.900 --> 48:24.569
- Man, he has really
hit rock bottom.

48:25.136 --> 48:26.938
Let's go.

48:27.438 --> 48:27.838
Let's go see that fuckin' moron.

48:27.905 --> 48:29.007
Come on.

48:34.312 --> 48:36.081
- Take 17.

48:38.249 --> 48:39.985
- The camera's
not focused, but okay.

48:40.051 --> 48:41.286
- Camera's rolling!

48:43.121 --> 48:44.022
Action!

48:48.059 --> 48:49.027
Cut, cut, cut!

48:50.028 --> 48:52.030
Holly, what the
fuck are you doin'?

48:52.830 --> 48:55.000
- Oh, I thought that
if I was in the scene,

48:55.733 --> 48:57.002
then it would make
the killing scarier

48:57.068 --> 48:58.736
because I could react to it.

48:58.803 --> 49:01.072
- Oh, that's what you thought?

49:01.139 --> 49:02.740
First of all, Nicole
doesn't die in this scene.

49:02.807 --> 49:05.276
Second of all, get the
fuck out of my frame!

49:05.343 --> 49:07.245
- Fine.

49:08.213 --> 49:10.081
If you don't like my ideas,

49:10.848 --> 49:12.650
then I'm just gonna
go take the GoPro

49:12.717 --> 49:13.251
and make my own
movie without you.

49:13.318 --> 49:14.385
- Good!

49:14.452 --> 49:16.354
Fuckin' hallelujah!

49:16.421 --> 49:17.788
Grab the GoPro, get
the fuck out of here!

49:19.190 --> 49:21.059
- Excuse you!

49:21.859 --> 49:23.294
- Excuse me?
- You know who I am.

49:23.361 --> 49:25.030
I am Holly Monroe.

49:25.496 --> 49:27.265
- You're not a Marilyn Monroe!

49:27.332 --> 49:29.300
You're in your fuckin' head!
Move!

49:29.367 --> 49:31.736
- You wouldn't know talent
if it hit you in the face.

49:32.370 --> 49:34.205
I am the star of this film.

49:34.272 --> 49:36.707
If this film is successful,
it's because of me.

49:36.774 --> 49:37.542
- Oh really?
- It's not because of you.

49:37.608 --> 49:38.743
- You are nothing!
- What?

49:38.809 --> 49:40.645
- You are nothing
without Holly Monroe!

49:40.711 --> 49:41.979
I am the fucking star!

49:42.513 --> 49:43.748
- Yeah, you may
look like a star,

49:43.814 --> 49:44.715
but you can act
like fuckin' shit.

49:44.782 --> 49:45.916
- Oh, really?

49:45.983 --> 49:46.717
- So grab the GoPro and
get the fuck off my set!

49:46.784 --> 49:49.054
- Oh I will gladly do that.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.988
- Go!
- Good luck with your own movie.

49:51.789 --> 49:53.724
- This is the last
you're gonna see of me!

49:53.791 --> 49:55.826
- Thank you, thank you!
- Good luck without me!

49:55.893 --> 49:57.728
- Thank you, thank you!
- Goodbye!

49:57.795 --> 49:59.164
- Thank you, thank
you, thank you!

49:59.230 --> 50:00.231
Jesus fucking Christ.

50:00.798 --> 50:02.367
She's unbelievable.

50:02.433 --> 50:03.834
- , dude.

50:03.901 --> 50:04.835
- From the top, yes.

50:04.902 --> 50:05.536
Can we start again?
- Yeah.

50:05.603 --> 50:06.504
- Thank you.

50:06.571 --> 50:17.715
- I want
the GoPro back.

50:17.782 --> 50:20.085
- Hello, my name is Holly Monroe

50:20.918 --> 50:24.255
and I am broadcasting
from my first big film.

50:25.256 --> 50:27.292
Today I will be doing
a monologue for you

50:28.226 --> 50:30.795
from To Die For
with Nicole Kidman.

51:00.458 --> 51:03.228
Here's
what I found out:

51:04.229 --> 51:06.364
That all of life is a
learning experience.

51:07.565 --> 51:10.101
Everything is part
of a big master plan.

51:11.202 --> 51:15.206
But sometimes it's,
well, it's hard to read.

51:16.274 --> 51:18.343
It's like when you stand
too close to the screen.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.846
All you can see is a
bunch of little dots.

51:23.214 --> 51:25.550
You can't see the big
picture until you stand back.

51:25.616 --> 51:29.354
But when you do, everything
comes into focus.

51:59.650 --> 52:01.219
- McInnes!

52:11.362 --> 52:12.397
Get out of there.

52:12.463 --> 52:13.564
Get back, get away
from that fuckin' door.

52:15.032 --> 52:15.866
Fuck!

52:19.337 --> 52:20.371
What?

52:21.972 --> 52:23.441
Look at this fuckin' shithole.

52:25.443 --> 52:26.444
- Hello, Edward.

52:28.446 --> 52:29.414
- Holy shit.

52:30.715 --> 52:32.517
- Congratulations, Edward,
you've become a drama queen.

52:33.951 --> 52:36.254
- Will you look at this sorry
piece of shit over here?

52:36.954 --> 52:38.823
Look at this fuckin' guy.

52:39.557 --> 52:40.858
Want me to help ya up, John?

52:40.925 --> 52:42.327
Yeah, let me help ya up.

52:42.927 --> 52:44.295
Come on get up, get up!

52:44.695 --> 52:45.863
Look at you souse.

52:46.364 --> 52:47.432
Holy shit.

52:48.065 --> 52:49.367
- And who the fuck are you?

52:50.568 --> 52:51.836
Oh!

52:52.069 --> 52:52.903
- Wow.

52:55.673 --> 52:57.542
- John, you called
Cherry Hill police

52:58.576 --> 53:00.345
and tell them you're
one of my guys?

53:00.978 --> 53:01.379
You fuckin' stupid or what?

53:01.446 --> 53:02.913
- Maybe.

53:03.481 --> 53:04.482
- Maybe?
- Maybe.

53:05.316 --> 53:06.851
- Yes or no?

53:06.917 --> 53:08.185
- Okay, I did.

53:09.554 --> 53:12.189
I've called every fuckin' one
of them, you mother fucker!

53:12.657 --> 53:15.192
Every fuckin' station I called

53:16.494 --> 53:18.529
because you're not calling them.

53:18.596 --> 53:21.666
Until last week at Cherry
Hill, he's been silent.

53:21.732 --> 53:23.334
Morons.

53:24.369 --> 53:26.304
You morons can't figure
anything out, can you?

53:27.037 --> 53:28.906
He's going to go again, Edward!

53:28.973 --> 53:30.641
And this time the
bodies are gonna be

53:30.708 --> 53:32.209
on your motherfucking head!

53:32.610 --> 53:33.844
- Wow.

53:33.911 --> 53:36.481
- Get, if you touch me I'll
fuckin' break your skull!

53:36.547 --> 53:38.883
- Calm down,
just calm down. Captain.

53:38.949 --> 53:40.885
- Let's just pretend like
none of this ever happened.

53:41.719 --> 53:43.288
And why don't you
guys get the fuck out?

53:45.556 --> 53:46.624
- That's
it, take this fuck!

53:49.394 --> 53:50.027
Get this fuck!

53:50.695 --> 53:52.530
You stupid son of a bitch.

53:53.764 --> 53:55.700
- You must be
so proud of yourselves.

53:55.766 --> 53:57.067
- Now you've done it, you fuck.

53:57.134 --> 53:58.503
Shut up and listen to me!

53:58.769 --> 54:00.438
Shut up!

54:00.505 --> 54:02.540
This is what we're gonna
fuckin' do with you.

54:02.607 --> 54:03.641
- You know you're
spitting on me.

54:03.708 --> 54:05.976
- I am going to leave
you my phone number,

54:06.677 --> 54:07.978
and you're gonna call me instead

54:08.045 --> 54:09.514
of the fuckin' police station.

54:09.580 --> 54:10.681
Fuckin' idiot.

54:10.748 --> 54:11.916
We're gonna let him up.

54:11.982 --> 54:12.883
We're gonna let him up.

54:12.950 --> 54:13.951
- I'm not
lettin' him up.

54:14.018 --> 54:14.719
- Let
him up, let him up.

54:14.785 --> 54:15.686
- I have something to say.

54:15.753 --> 54:17.388
- Okay, what's it
gonna be, John?

54:17.455 --> 54:17.588
Go 'head.

54:18.656 --> 54:20.725
- I bet you've no idea
what pain is like.

54:20.791 --> 54:23.294
Every day I wake up
and because of you,

54:24.061 --> 54:25.930
my wife doesn't want
to see me anymore.

54:26.764 --> 54:31.536
And I lost my son
because of this case.

54:33.704 --> 54:36.040
Now you need to
go fuck yourself.

54:36.674 --> 54:39.444
- Let him up, let him up.

54:39.744 --> 54:40.978
Let him up.

54:41.612 --> 54:43.481
Fuckin' lunatic.

54:43.548 --> 54:45.282
Voight, let's go.

54:46.016 --> 54:47.618
Leave him be in
his fuckin' misery.

54:47.685 --> 54:49.420
Holy shit.

54:58.629 --> 54:59.630
- Alright, is
everyone ready for the scene?

54:59.697 --> 55:01.432
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

55:01.499 --> 55:02.567
- Alright, I think
this is our actor here.

55:02.633 --> 55:03.901
Hello, Michael?
- Yeah, what's up?

55:03.968 --> 55:05.370
- Darren. Thank you so much for
bein' in my little film.

55:05.436 --> 55:06.537
- Mmhmm.

55:06.604 --> 55:07.605
- Here's your mask.
- Mask.

55:12.042 --> 55:13.043
- I was
gonna have you, uh,

55:13.110 --> 55:14.211
go around the corner here

55:14.278 --> 55:16.447
and then I'm gonna signal
you when I need you.

55:16.514 --> 55:19.149
They're gonna have a little
bit of dialogue first. Okay?

55:19.216 --> 55:20.685
Uh, can you fill up the
knife and give it to Michael?

55:20.751 --> 55:21.786
- Yes, yes.

55:21.852 --> 55:23.120
- Okay, thank you.

55:23.187 --> 55:24.689
Now this is a real knife.

55:24.755 --> 55:25.523
Just be, be very careful, okay?

55:25.590 --> 55:27.392
- Okay, definitely.

55:27.458 --> 55:28.325
Yeah.

55:29.794 --> 55:32.129
- Be careful.

55:38.536 --> 55:40.137
- Okay, this is
what's going to happen.

55:40.204 --> 55:42.473
You guys are gonna run out
here, a little bit of dialogue.

55:42.540 --> 55:44.141
Michael's gonna come
around from the corner.

55:44.208 --> 55:46.411
He's gonna kill Johnny, he's
doubling as an actor today.

55:46.477 --> 55:47.678
Okay?

55:49.547 --> 55:50.114
You fine with that?
- Oh yeah.

55:50.180 --> 55:50.581
- You understand?

55:50.648 --> 55:53.050
- Mmhmm.

55:53.117 --> 55:54.419
- Yeah, so, I look back at
him as the killer kills him?

55:54.485 --> 55:55.219
- Mmhmm.

55:55.285 --> 55:56.421
- Do you want me to scream?

55:57.622 --> 55:59.557
- I want you to act as
if it's really happening.

55:59.624 --> 56:01.091
- Okay, I can do that.

56:01.158 --> 56:02.159
- Alright, thank you.

56:02.226 --> 56:03.027
- 'kay.

56:04.194 --> 56:04.962
- Okay, well
I'm gonna shoot this one

56:05.029 --> 56:05.396
because Johnny's in the scene.

56:05.463 --> 56:06.330
Okay?

56:06.397 --> 56:08.833
Alright, let's
go, let's do this.

56:08.899 --> 56:14.138
- Alright, let's do it!

56:14.204 --> 56:15.706
- I'm ready when you are.

56:15.773 --> 56:19.777
- I'm ready.

56:19.844 --> 56:21.446
Ready?

56:22.179 --> 56:23.481
- You ready for my mark?

56:23.814 --> 56:24.582
- Yep.

56:24.649 --> 56:26.083
- Okay.

56:26.150 --> 56:28.586
We have Familiar Stranger,
scene two, take one.

56:31.789 --> 56:33.424
- Alright,
camera's rolling!

56:35.826 --> 56:37.061
Action!

56:40.130 --> 56:41.231
- What are we gonna do?

56:41.298 --> 56:42.833
I think he killed them all.

56:42.900 --> 56:44.201
- We have got to
get out of here!

56:44.268 --> 56:45.736
- We should go
back to the house.

56:45.803 --> 56:46.871
She might be still alive.

56:46.937 --> 56:48.539
- No she's not.

56:48.606 --> 56:48.939
I saw the body.

56:49.006 --> 56:49.674
Oh!

56:54.812 --> 56:56.581
Ow!

57:04.722 --> 57:05.723
- Cut!

57:06.824 --> 57:07.592
Oh shit, that's fuckin' amazing.

57:09.560 --> 57:10.661
Oh, oh wow.

57:10.728 --> 57:13.430
Michael, you walked off.

57:13.898 --> 57:15.500
I need you to go after Nicole.

57:15.566 --> 57:16.433
You know what?

57:16.834 --> 57:18.569
No worries, no worries.

57:19.837 --> 57:21.238
We'll get it in a closeup, okay?

57:21.305 --> 57:23.173
I think I got that in one shot.

57:23.240 --> 57:24.642
- I think so.

57:24.709 --> 57:26.176
- Oh wow.

57:26.243 --> 57:26.977
Come on, guys, yo, let's
take a look at this.

57:27.044 --> 57:28.646
It looked so real, come on.

57:28.713 --> 57:29.547

57:29.614 --> 57:30.715
- Johnny, get up.

57:30.781 --> 57:31.582
Come on, let's watch this.
- This guy.

57:31.649 --> 57:32.750
- Yo, everyone, it was so real.

57:32.817 --> 57:33.718
You gotta see it.
- come on, Johnny.

57:34.785 --> 57:35.853
- Johnny,
come on, get up.

57:35.920 --> 57:36.320
I want you to take your
hand out, let's go.

57:36.386 --> 57:36.453
Come on!

57:37.722 --> 57:38.523
Johnny?

57:38.989 --> 57:41.526
- Johnny.

57:41.592 --> 57:42.727
Johnny, get up.

57:42.793 --> 57:44.795
Johnny, get up!

57:46.931 --> 57:48.465
He's dead.

57:48.866 --> 57:51.201
- What?

57:51.268 --> 57:51.902
Johnny, Johnny, let's go!

57:51.969 --> 57:53.203
- What?

57:53.871 --> 57:55.472
- Who was that guy?

57:58.275 --> 58:00.545
We gotta get out of here.

58:00.611 --> 58:00.945
Grab everything you
can and let's go!

58:01.011 --> 58:02.680
Now!

58:03.013 --> 58:03.948
Come on, let's go!

58:05.282 --> 58:06.316
Darren, let's go!

58:06.383 --> 58:08.686
Kait, come on, we
gotta leave him, honey.

58:08.919 --> 58:10.588
Come on.

58:10.888 --> 58:11.789
Come on.

58:11.856 --> 58:12.757
No, no, no, no.

58:13.023 --> 58:13.958
Let's go.

58:14.024 --> 58:15.225
Darren, come on.

58:24.301 --> 58:29.607
- What the
fuck's happening?

58:29.674 --> 58:31.576
- In the
farming community made popular

58:31.642 --> 58:33.811
by Creamy Acres Night
of Terror Fright Farm,

58:33.878 --> 58:36.180
the terror for one family
has become all too real.

58:36.947 --> 58:38.248
As I'm standing in
front of the home

58:38.315 --> 58:39.650
of Betsy and John Andrews.

58:40.384 --> 58:42.787
Parents anxiously
awaiting the news

58:42.853 --> 58:45.255
of their missing teenage
daughter, Vanessa Andrews,

58:45.322 --> 58:46.857
with a rash of kidnappings

58:46.924 --> 58:48.525
and murders all
over south Jersey.

58:49.426 --> 58:51.528
Earlier today, the mother
of this missing teenager

58:51.929 --> 58:53.831
made a heartfelt appeal.

58:54.665 --> 58:56.667
- My name is Betsy Andrews.

58:56.734 --> 58:58.703
If you have any
information on my daughter,

58:58.769 --> 59:01.538
my baby, Vanessa,

59:04.041 --> 59:04.875
please.

59:06.811 --> 59:08.913
- Reporting
live in south Jersey for WMAM,

59:08.979 --> 59:10.681
I'm Gail Scott Key.

59:57.795 --> 59:59.363
- Shh.

01:00:09.139 --> 01:00:10.741
- Oh fuck, shit.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:11.876
Oh shit.

01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:17.347
Oh.

01:00:24.021 --> 01:00:24.989
I wanna see where she went.

01:00:25.055 --> 01:00:26.957
- Everything
comes into focus.

01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:47.097
- Lizzie.

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:52.136
Let her go.

01:02:53.037 --> 01:02:55.172
Lizzie, come on!

01:03:00.177 --> 01:03:01.045
Lizzie!

01:03:02.179 --> 01:03:03.013
Let, let her go!

01:04:22.759 --> 01:04:24.995
Okay, we have to get to a phone.

01:04:25.662 --> 01:04:27.597
Let's go inside that farmhouse.

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:32.202
I know it's not safe
but we have to get help.

01:04:32.269 --> 01:04:34.071
On three.

01:04:34.771 --> 01:04:35.872
One,

01:04:36.106 --> 01:04:36.974
two,

01:04:37.174 --> 01:04:38.542
three!

01:04:47.417 --> 01:04:49.186
Okay, try to find a phone.

01:04:49.753 --> 01:04:51.121
- Okay.

01:05:04.168 --> 01:05:05.135
- Okay, we have to hide.

01:05:06.403 --> 01:05:08.205
We have a better chance of
surviving if we split up.

01:05:08.272 --> 01:05:10.040
You have to go now.

01:05:10.107 --> 01:05:10.540
Go, go, go, go, go.

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:15.145
Go Lizzie.

01:08:55.532 --> 01:08:57.133
- Hey, you fucker!

01:09:02.439 --> 01:09:03.340
- Go!

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:17.421
Help us!

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:18.854
- If anything
comes outside that house,

01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:19.456
just start shooting.

01:09:19.523 --> 01:09:20.823
Get in the car.

01:09:24.361 --> 01:09:25.495
Call my Captain.

01:09:25.562 --> 01:09:26.595
Tell him I have Harrison Graves.

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:27.631
He's killed again.

01:09:27.697 --> 01:09:29.265
- You're a cop?

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:33.903
- Today I am.

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:44.881
- I hope he kills
this motherfucker.

01:09:45.549 --> 01:09:49.286
- Hey, Harrison!

01:09:52.356 --> 01:09:53.957

01:10:36.433 --> 01:10:38.435
- The keys,

Nicole.

01:10:52.749 --> 01:10:54.384

Contact local police
and state troopers.

01:11:31.154 --> 01:11:32.422
I gotta fix you up, buddy.

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:34.591
- Stop him.

01:12:06.756 --> 01:12:08.458
- Are you sure
you want to do that?

01:12:31.147 --> 01:12:32.649
See what happens the
next time you do it.

01:13:04.781 --> 01:13:05.749
- It came from over there!

01:13:11.688 --> 01:13:12.689

01:13:50.894 --> 01:13:51.861

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:13.577

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:45.675
This is Captain Links!

01:15:46.075 --> 01:15:47.276
Is anybody in here?

01:15:47.343 --> 01:15:48.612

You're gonna come to

We have the situation

01:18:29.138 --> 01:18:30.706
- Is that a toy?

01:18:31.074 --> 01:18:32.708
- It was my son's.

01:18:33.176 --> 01:18:34.911
He loved playing detective.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.382
- Good news is,

01:18:39.448 --> 01:18:41.417
as soon as you're better,
you're reinstated.

01:18:41.484 --> 01:18:42.852
Special Victims Unit.

Will you call my wife?

Tell her I was right?

01:18:56.499 --> 01:18:58.034
