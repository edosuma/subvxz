00:06.640 --> 00:08.640
<i>Previously
on "falling water"...</i>

00:08.642 --> 00:09.641
I wanna see my baby.

00:09.643 --> 00:11.510
There is no baby, dear.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.779
<i>Bill Boerg really wants
to meet with you.</i>

00:13.781 --> 00:15.781
<i>See if you can think about
what he might be dreaming.</i>

00:15.783 --> 00:17.316
<i>- Your man was there.
- Andy?</i>

00:17.318 --> 00:19.651
Go to st. Joseph's hospital
in queens.

00:19.653 --> 00:22.254
And the billing code
is for an epidural.

00:22.256 --> 00:24.289
<i>The next time you shag
the wife of a senior partner,</i>

00:24.291 --> 00:26.191
tell her not to sext you
on your company cell.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.626
<i>Think jones
is insider trading?</i>

00:27.628 --> 00:29.395
The answer is,
I have no idea.

00:29.397 --> 00:31.230
<i>I thought we weren't
seeing each other.</i>

00:31.232 --> 00:33.265
<i>We're not.
I'm not even here.</i>

00:36.237 --> 00:38.303
<i>you look like you got
run over in your sleep.</i>

00:38.305 --> 00:40.105
got a line on your vic.

00:40.107 --> 00:42.808
- Lady's name is ann-marie bowen.
- You need to call 911.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.443
Send the police
to this location.

00:44.445 --> 00:46.512
- What's going on?
<i>- It's topeka.</i>

00:46.514 --> 00:49.181
It's always topeka.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.250
you look like
the sky's about to fall.

00:51.252 --> 00:52.484
<i>Sky's fine
right where it is.</i>

01:12.807 --> 01:16.241
<i>a quote from shakespeare.</i>

01:16.243 --> 01:19.411
<i>Forgive me if I get it wrong.</i>

01:19.413 --> 01:23.682
<i>"'I can call spirits
from the vasty deep.'</i>

01:23.684 --> 01:28.187
<i>"'why, so can I,
so can any man;</i>

01:28.189 --> 01:31.256
<i>but will they come
when you do call them?'"</i>

01:31.258 --> 01:33.125
never seen her in my life,

01:33.127 --> 01:34.460
but if she's some big deal,

01:34.462 --> 01:36.495
I can keep my eye out.

01:36.497 --> 01:38.297
Sure, that'd be great.
Thanks.

01:38.299 --> 01:41.433
You look like
the sky's about to fall.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.135
Sky's fine right where it is.

01:43.137 --> 01:45.471
Thank you for your help.

01:53.581 --> 01:54.746
we're done here.

01:54.748 --> 01:56.748
Let's torch it.

02:51.505 --> 02:54.439
can I clear the rusty nail?

02:54.441 --> 02:55.541
I'm with someone.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.409
The rusty nail's for her.

02:57.411 --> 02:59.278
I don't think so.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.846
I think you're alone.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.465
sir, the restaurant's closing.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.801
No, no, we were here.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.369
Four...

03:24.371 --> 03:26.371
Uh, three nights ago.

03:26.373 --> 03:29.675
She, uh...we went outside,

03:29.677 --> 03:31.643
and they, uh...

03:34.615 --> 03:37.549
She was taken by men.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.251
That was a dream.

03:40.821 --> 03:42.955
This is a dream.

03:48.696 --> 03:49.995
we were here.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.739
you owe the hospital $10.

05:09.543 --> 05:11.710
I'd like to see
the rest of my patient file.

05:11.712 --> 05:14.646
You don't have a file.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.349
So how do you know
I owe $10?

05:17.351 --> 05:21.320
'cause it says here
you owe $10.

05:21.322 --> 05:23.855
How can I owe $10
if I've never been a patient?

05:23.857 --> 05:25.590
Mysteries of the universe.

05:44.611 --> 05:45.744
thanks for making time.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.112
Oh, we all gotta
help each other.

05:47.114 --> 05:48.113
Come on back.

05:48.115 --> 05:49.448
We got coffee if you want,

05:49.450 --> 05:50.582
and some bastard
brought doughnuts.

05:50.584 --> 05:52.117
As if I need the temptation.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.586
They say a little temptation's
good for the soul.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.988
Yeah, assuming
we've got one.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.057
So, uh, where do things stand?

05:59.059 --> 06:01.526
Uh, the investigation's
ongoing.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.761
It's been almost a week.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.096
You've had to have made
some progress.

06:04.098 --> 06:06.765
Yeah, four days,
and it's ongoing.

06:08.402 --> 06:10.702
12 people laid down in a house
and killed themselves.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.572
I mean, forget they blew up
the house across the street.

06:13.574 --> 06:17.676
How do 12 people decide
just to kill themselves?

06:17.678 --> 06:19.444
Well, I have my own opinions,

06:19.446 --> 06:21.513
but they're no more informed
than anyone else's.

06:21.515 --> 06:23.448
Al-qaeda posts videos
on the web.

06:23.450 --> 06:25.016
These guys don't even have
a known ethos,

06:25.018 --> 06:26.785
much less a public profile.

06:26.787 --> 06:28.487
Unless you count
the word "topeka,"

06:28.489 --> 06:31.156
which apparently means
"a good place to grow potatoes."

06:31.158 --> 06:32.891
"a good place
to dig for roots."

06:32.893 --> 06:34.760
yeah, well,
we know they're a cult,

06:34.762 --> 06:36.628
but they're not jihadist
or far right wing.

06:36.630 --> 06:38.029
We know they blew up the house,

06:38.031 --> 06:39.931
but they've made no calls
for violence.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.566
They're still dangerous.

06:41.568 --> 06:44.703
And that's why
the investigation's ongoing.

06:44.705 --> 06:46.538
Is there anything
in the green sneakers?

06:46.540 --> 06:48.807
Generic brand,
national chain.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.543
Here we go.

06:51.545 --> 06:54.746
Logbook from
the belgian consulate...

06:56.049 --> 06:59.885
And the personal effects
of ann-marie bowen,

06:59.887 --> 07:01.686
the white one.

07:01.688 --> 07:03.755
We've closed off that portion
of the investigation,

07:03.757 --> 07:07.426
so nypd can dispose of them
as you see fit.

07:07.428 --> 07:08.560
Is that it?

07:08.562 --> 07:09.861
You just need me
to take the logbook

07:09.863 --> 07:11.096
back to the consulate?

07:11.098 --> 07:13.598
You're nypd liaison.

07:23.110 --> 07:25.043
thank you.

08:05.719 --> 08:08.587
I expected you in early.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.956
I saw you, uh, speaking
with woody hammond?

08:10.958 --> 08:12.991
We're giving him
some of jones' accounts.

08:12.993 --> 08:14.893
His numbers are better
than you think,

08:14.895 --> 08:18.497
and he and jones came over
from deutsche together, so...

08:18.499 --> 08:21.233
"continuity
of client relations."

08:21.235 --> 08:23.969
- whole thing's tragic.
- Did you call campbell's?

08:23.971 --> 08:26.271
They'll pick up the body
as soon as the me releases it.

08:26.273 --> 08:27.839
What about the obit
in the "times"?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.708
It'll run Monday.
Three-inch column.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.777
All right,
so how bad off are we?

08:32.779 --> 08:35.013
I combed jones' computer
and files.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.548
They're immaculate.

08:36.549 --> 08:37.682
If there was anything
to hurt the firm,

08:37.683 --> 08:39.017
he scrubbed it.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.751
Well, at least he did us
that courtesy.

08:40.754 --> 08:42.187
Or maybe there was
nothing to find.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.222
Jones was regularly predicting
market swings

08:44.224 --> 08:46.157
like he could see into the minds
of half the street.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.726
That's an argument
for clairvoyance,

08:47.728 --> 08:48.894
not insider trading.

08:48.896 --> 08:50.562
Then why was he
only clairvoyant

08:50.564 --> 08:52.764
- in his topeka accounts?
- The man killed himself.

08:52.766 --> 08:54.165
He didn't do it for no reason.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.134
I'd like to search
jones' apartment.

08:56.136 --> 08:58.136
If there's nothing here,
maybe the evidence is buried

08:58.138 --> 08:59.671
in his home files.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.273
Is his wife back in the city?

09:01.275 --> 09:03.708
Bizzy and I are supposed to go
over and pay our respects today.

09:03.710 --> 09:05.043
If the government
comes knocking,

09:05.045 --> 09:07.145
we need to make sure
we're inoculated.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.014
Get a ride in the car uptown
with my wife.

09:09.016 --> 09:10.849
I've still got a call
with antwerp,

09:10.851 --> 09:13.852
and she'll appreciate
the company.

09:21.128 --> 09:24.296
swell office.

09:24.298 --> 09:26.698
This is my office.
This is just a room.

09:26.700 --> 09:29.267
There are no other records
at the hospital.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.903
I know.
I looked.

09:31.905 --> 09:34.072
- I looked hard.
- So it's a coding error.

09:34.074 --> 09:35.874
Really,
some random clerk

09:35.876 --> 09:38.610
randomly mis-entered
the exact code for an epidural,

09:38.612 --> 09:40.145
one of ten thousand
possible codes,

09:40.147 --> 09:42.280
in your file
of all possible files?

09:42.282 --> 09:44.082
Then you explain it.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.584
You had an epidural.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.652
You gave birth to a son.

09:48.989 --> 09:51.723
Tess, I believe you.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.024
Of all the people
in your life,

09:53.026 --> 09:55.226
how many
actually believe you?

09:56.897 --> 09:58.296
none of 'em.

09:58.298 --> 09:59.631
So have a little faith

09:59.633 --> 10:01.833
in those of us who have faith.

10:01.835 --> 10:04.302
It's dreams that connect us.
You experienced it.

10:04.304 --> 10:08.640
What we don't know
is how those connections work,

10:08.642 --> 10:12.043
but with your help, I was hoping
we could figure that out.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.778
How do you know
so much about me?

10:13.780 --> 10:14.879
Truth?

10:14.881 --> 10:17.015
I stalked you.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.783
Cyberstalked.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.688
Five years ago,
I tried to hire you

10:23.690 --> 10:26.124
to consult on my 3gen phone,
and you turned me down,

10:26.126 --> 10:27.993
and I still don't know why,

10:27.995 --> 10:29.761
but I decided
you were interesting,

10:29.763 --> 10:32.864
and data mining
and algorithms did the rest.

10:34.368 --> 10:38.036
If you wanna convince me,
you're not helping yourself.

10:38.038 --> 10:42.007
Listen to your language.
You wanna be convinced.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.309
No.

10:44.311 --> 10:47.779
Then go.

10:47.781 --> 10:49.648
No.

10:49.650 --> 10:51.349
Well, there we are.

11:01.928 --> 11:03.128
This is your new phone.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.163
We need you to track
your sleep patterns,

11:05.165 --> 11:07.432
exercise, diet.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.167
Carry it with you at all times.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.235
I already have a phone.

11:10.237 --> 11:12.437
So don't use it as a phone.

11:12.439 --> 11:14.172
Now, before you can
participate,

11:14.174 --> 11:16.174
we need to establish
a baseline medical history.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.976
Please answer honestly.

11:17.978 --> 11:20.045
have you ever been diagnosed
with any of the following:

11:20.047 --> 11:21.046
- Cancer?
- No.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.847
- Arrhythmia?
- No.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.115
- Seizures?
- No.

11:24.117 --> 11:26.851
Are you currently
menstruating?

11:26.853 --> 11:29.454
No.

11:29.456 --> 11:30.955
I'll wait outside.

11:34.461 --> 11:35.927
have you ever been diagnosed

11:35.929 --> 11:37.195
with a sexually transmitted
disease?

11:37.197 --> 11:38.329
No.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.764
Have you ever
been hospitalized

11:39.766 --> 11:42.067
for mental illness?

11:42.069 --> 11:43.301
No.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.036
We know about your time
at cranwell

11:45.038 --> 11:46.304
and st. John b.

11:46.306 --> 11:47.305
Then why ask the question?

11:47.307 --> 11:48.940
Purity of the data.

11:48.942 --> 11:50.909
If the data's faulty,
the study's meaningless

11:50.911 --> 11:53.478
and we're all wasting our time.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.947
Have you ever been diagnosed
with genetic disorder:

11:55.949 --> 11:59.050
- Ms, als, crohn's?
- No.

11:59.052 --> 12:02.187
I've always had nightmares
about that staircase.

12:02.189 --> 12:05.724
And then those people killing
themselves in that house.

12:05.726 --> 12:07.225
So many things,

12:07.227 --> 12:09.327
just beyond
the corner of your eye.

12:09.329 --> 12:12.130
That's new york.

12:12.132 --> 12:14.032
8 million people side by side,

12:14.034 --> 12:15.433
trying not to notice each other.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.507
You know, is it possible for me
to speak with the ambassador?

12:22.509 --> 12:24.109
Ann-marie bowen
asked to see him,

12:24.111 --> 12:25.443
and I wanna make sure
it wasn't about someone

12:25.445 --> 12:27.145
who didn't make it
into the book.

12:27.147 --> 12:29.380
The ambassador's in montreal
with his wife,

12:29.382 --> 12:31.116
but I can pull his diary.

12:31.118 --> 12:32.984
I'd appreciate it.

13:03.049 --> 13:04.449
is that your son?

13:04.451 --> 13:06.951
- You think he could be?
- He's not?

13:06.953 --> 13:09.454
It was a gift
from the ambassador.

13:09.456 --> 13:11.790
We were in a record store
in the west village.

13:11.792 --> 13:14.192
I saw the sketch on the wall.
He bought it for me.

13:14.194 --> 13:17.462
Hmm. You and the ambassador
go to record stores a lot?

13:17.464 --> 13:19.931
Only when his wife's
out of the country.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.800
We're belgian, not french.

13:21.802 --> 13:24.435
It was drawn by some musician
I'd never heard of

13:24.437 --> 13:26.471
a million years ago.

13:26.473 --> 13:28.940
I'm not even sure
why I like it.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.309
Maybe it's the way
he watches over me.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.945
What was the name
of the store?

13:33.947 --> 13:36.981
Topeka city blues.

13:52.933 --> 13:55.366
please, let us take care of it.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.149
you haven't seen a bible
around here,

14:11.151 --> 14:12.417
preferably king james?

14:12.419 --> 14:14.285
Laura needs a reading
for the service,

14:14.287 --> 14:15.620
and I'll be damned
if I let her settle

14:15.622 --> 14:18.890
for "my father's house
has many rooms."

14:18.892 --> 14:20.592
it's about as personal
as a walmart.

14:20.594 --> 14:23.628
- Aha.
- Try job 19.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.097
"for I know my redeemer liveth."

14:27.267 --> 14:28.433
all right.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.506
Ha.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.275
"for I know
that my redeemer liveth

14:37.277 --> 14:39.978
"and that he shall stand
the latter day upon the earth.

14:39.980 --> 14:42.313
"and after my skin
has been destroyed,

14:42.315 --> 14:46.251
yet in my flesh
I shall see god."

14:46.253 --> 14:48.920
well, that's a cheery vision.

14:48.922 --> 14:50.421
A body without skin.

14:50.423 --> 14:52.590
A man redeemed is a man
whose life was worthwhile.

14:55.462 --> 14:57.962
So saith
the dirty-laundry man.

14:57.964 --> 14:59.464
That is why you're here,
isn't it?

14:59.466 --> 15:01.199
To destroy a dead man's
good name

15:01.201 --> 15:02.433
while his wife sits
in the other room

15:02.435 --> 15:04.202
chewing valium?

15:04.204 --> 15:05.904
I'm here to protect the firm.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.106
You say potato.

15:08.108 --> 15:11.943
I didn't destroy your life.

15:11.945 --> 15:14.312
When you sent those texts
to woody hammond,

15:14.314 --> 15:16.614
you sent them to his
company-owned cell phone.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.450
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.920
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

15:21.922 --> 15:24.355
They were quite explicit...

15:24.357 --> 15:25.456
Sexually.

15:30.063 --> 15:33.364
But not every truth needs
the light of day.

15:44.511 --> 15:47.245
you'll be one of eight
participants in today's test.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.113
Your goal is to dream
and, in your dream,

15:49.115 --> 15:51.115
rendezvous
with the other subjects.

15:51.117 --> 15:54.218
- Would you like a sleep aid?
- No.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.287
If you change your mind
once you lie down,

15:56.289 --> 15:58.056
raise your hand;
we'll come to you.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.291
If you wake up
before the other participants,

16:00.293 --> 16:02.593
raise your hand;
do not wake the others.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.229
If you and another participant
wake at the same time,

16:05.231 --> 16:07.231
do not acknowledge each other.

16:07.233 --> 16:08.967
Waking interaction
between the subjects

16:08.969 --> 16:12.136
jeopardizes the purity
of the data.

16:12.138 --> 16:14.973
Don't drag your wires
on the floor.

16:29.089 --> 16:31.990
are you sure
you don't want something?

16:46.606 --> 16:48.039
lie down.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.118
close your eyes.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.452
Now dream.

19:08.448 --> 19:11.215
you're new.

19:11.217 --> 19:13.317
Where are the others?

19:13.319 --> 19:14.919
Not everybody makes it.

19:14.921 --> 19:16.754
We're really
not supposed to talk.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.840
I thought andy
might be here.

19:35.842 --> 19:37.808
He had a beard.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.444
Yeah.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.313
No, andy...

19:42.315 --> 19:44.849
He hasn't been around
in a while.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.851
Where is he?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.386
No way to know.

19:48.388 --> 19:50.922
He was here;
he was gone.

19:50.924 --> 19:53.658
Sue heard he stroked out,
went catatonic.

19:53.660 --> 19:54.926
Shh.

20:07.273 --> 20:09.740
you have a nice face.

20:09.742 --> 20:11.943
It's just a face.

20:14.948 --> 20:17.648
hey, don't get distracted.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.650
Your own dream
will suck you back in.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.786
He's here.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.288
who?

20:24.290 --> 20:25.690
Where you going?

20:25.692 --> 20:27.358
We're supposed to stay together.

21:16.943 --> 21:18.309
wait.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.823
how long have I been alone?

21:32.825 --> 21:35.860
I can't tell you that.
Purity of the data.

21:52.578 --> 21:53.978
hi, I'm looking for a record.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.580
Hmm, close your eyes
and swing a dead cat.

21:56.582 --> 21:58.316
Or were you looking
for something specific?

21:58.318 --> 22:00.318
Cult musician.
New york guy.

22:00.320 --> 22:01.919
Robert eacey.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.722
All right, "somnambulism."

22:04.724 --> 22:07.892
one and only album
of bobby eacey.

22:10.830 --> 22:12.697
One of 12,000 pressed.

22:12.699 --> 22:14.965
<i>♪ got a hole in my pocket ♪</i>

22:14.967 --> 22:18.569
<i>♪ and it just keeps burning ♪</i>

22:18.571 --> 22:20.705
yeah, I was told you have
some of his artwork for sale.

22:20.707 --> 22:22.640
- Uh, sketches?
- "the boy," yeah.

22:22.642 --> 22:24.508
Yeah, I sold that.

22:24.510 --> 22:26.777
You have any others?

22:26.779 --> 22:28.479
Cost of bobby being dead,

22:28.481 --> 22:30.348
truncated supply.

22:30.350 --> 22:32.783
- When did he die?
- 1984, '85.

22:32.785 --> 22:36.854
Legend is, he went nuts,
got stabbed by his girlfriend.

22:36.856 --> 22:38.122
But who knows?

22:38.124 --> 22:40.658
Truth's only true
about half the time.

22:40.660 --> 22:41.859
When did he draw the picture?

22:41.861 --> 22:43.728
Uh, '82, '83.

22:43.730 --> 22:45.529
Album's got a scratch
on the b side,

22:45.531 --> 22:48.733
so it's only $200.

23:27.440 --> 23:30.040
they tell you
it gets easier, but...

23:30.042 --> 23:32.943
It still leaves me messed up
every time.

23:35.181 --> 23:38.749
I thought we weren't supposed
to have outside contact.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.918
Purity of the data.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.653
Man, to hell with it.

23:42.655 --> 23:44.555
They don't know what it's like.

23:44.557 --> 23:45.589
We're the ones deep in it.

23:45.591 --> 23:46.824
They're just...

23:46.826 --> 23:48.926
On the outside
watching dials.

24:01.574 --> 24:04.108
What are they?

24:04.110 --> 24:06.744
Forget-me-nots.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.546
They'll help even you out.

24:14.454 --> 24:18.589
If the tests are so awful,
why don't you walk away?

24:18.591 --> 24:20.157
The money.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.793
general laziness.

24:24.564 --> 24:27.465
You still have
a really nice face.

30:09.909 --> 30:12.376
Ugh, it's shit!

32:13.198 --> 32:14.965
how's the scavenger hunt?

32:14.967 --> 32:17.701
If jones was insider trading,
no one will ever know.

32:17.703 --> 32:19.102
So that's good news.

32:19.104 --> 32:20.704
We close the door
and walk away?

32:20.706 --> 32:22.239
Yeah.

32:22.241 --> 32:24.474
The firm's safe.

32:24.476 --> 32:27.377
It's not like jones
outsmarted you somehow.

32:27.379 --> 32:30.247
He's dead in a casket.

32:34.720 --> 32:38.255
you're good.
You know?

32:38.257 --> 32:40.557
You're a good dreamer.

32:40.559 --> 32:42.092

the guy you were looking for?

33:14.293 --> 33:16.660
In the dream?

33:16.662 --> 33:18.528
You said,

33:18.530 --> 33:20.630
"he's here."

33:20.632 --> 33:22.366
did I?

33:22.368 --> 33:24.034
I don't know.

33:36.648 --> 33:40.050
I sold Bill Boerg
three hits of molly.

33:40.052 --> 33:43.153
Next day,
he offered me a job.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.022
You?

33:45.024 --> 33:46.390
Same.

33:51.797 --> 33:53.563
yeah.

33:53.565 --> 33:56.199
I used to love to dream.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.567
Like a warm blanket.

33:57.569 --> 34:01.071
I'd...Wrap myself up
and hide.

34:03.509 --> 34:06.476
- My own private world.
- Mm.

34:06.478 --> 34:08.512
God...

34:08.514 --> 34:10.580
I wish I was
that young again.

34:15.054 --> 34:17.621
Tell me what you dreamed.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.425
No.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.427
Come on.

34:23.429 --> 34:26.362
We all dream.

34:30.235 --> 34:33.303
there's a stain on your
ceiling shaped like a rabbit.

34:35.239 --> 34:37.306
don't change the subject.

34:40.446 --> 34:43.413
I like rabbits.

34:43.415 --> 34:46.850
They're very attuned.

34:46.851 --> 34:50.187
Twitchy pink noses.

34:50.188 --> 34:52.822
Is that what you are
in your dreams?

34:52.824 --> 34:54.724
A rabbit?

34:54.726 --> 34:57.194
No.

34:57.196 --> 34:59.329
No, I'm a fox.

35:02.167 --> 35:05.435
so you eat rabbits?

35:05.437 --> 35:07.270
shut up.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.893
you would be the one
to catch me.

35:29.895 --> 35:32.262
don't do that.

35:34.133 --> 35:35.765
it barely registers.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.134
Is it because woody's here?

35:37.136 --> 35:40.303
you're so goddamn literal.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.405
Then why?

35:44.710 --> 35:47.244
to wake myself up.

35:47.246 --> 35:50.547
When all I wanna do is dream.

35:50.549 --> 35:52.249
Go ahead, tell nicholas.

35:52.251 --> 35:53.450
I don't care anymore.

35:53.452 --> 35:55.418
Tell me about your dreams.

35:55.420 --> 35:58.421
What do you dream about?

35:58.423 --> 36:00.423
Woody.

36:02.161 --> 36:03.727
every night.

36:03.729 --> 36:06.196
<i>We have this...</i>

36:06.198 --> 36:08.498
<i>Mad, passionate love affair.</i>

36:10.636 --> 36:13.937
<i>A relationship with
conversations and adventures.</i>

36:18.243 --> 36:20.443
Then I wake up
and it's all a dream.

36:20.445 --> 36:23.580
A reoccurring dream...

36:23.582 --> 36:25.749
about a pathetic, squirrelly man

36:25.751 --> 36:26.850
I don't even know.

36:26.852 --> 36:28.285
I don't believe you.

36:28.287 --> 36:30.220
I don't care.

36:30.222 --> 36:32.689
You can't have a relationship
that only exists in your dreams.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.424
why not?

36:34.426 --> 36:35.692
They're my dreams.

36:37.763 --> 36:39.496
Who cares?

36:39.498 --> 36:40.630
Your husband.

36:40.632 --> 36:42.632
wrong card.

36:43.936 --> 36:46.736
I care.

36:46.738 --> 36:48.939
Why?

36:48.941 --> 36:50.640
When I dream,

36:50.642 --> 36:52.309
I'm happy.

36:53.679 --> 36:56.446
I won't tell nicholas.

36:56.448 --> 36:59.950
Oh, don't be so kind.

38:01.413 --> 38:02.712
what the hell is this?

38:02.714 --> 38:04.581
Where'd you get this?

38:04.583 --> 38:06.583
Some guy shoved it in my hand
outside the subway.

38:06.585 --> 38:07.851
And you hung it
in your bathroom?

38:07.853 --> 38:09.052
Yeah,
the kid's creepy-looking.

38:09.054 --> 38:10.620
I thought it was cool.
What have I done?

38:10.622 --> 38:12.522
- I'm innocent.
- Get off me.

38:12.524 --> 38:15.292
Whoa, I'm sorry.
Tell me what I've done.

38:15.294 --> 38:17.560
Hey, tess, wait a minute.

38:17.562 --> 38:18.862
I didn't do anything.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.870
do you think I don't know
where my phones are?

38:29.841 --> 38:32.842
what aren't you telling me?

38:32.844 --> 38:35.478
About what?
About levon?

38:35.480 --> 38:37.981
That's a picture of my son.

38:37.983 --> 38:39.783
I have no idea.

38:39.785 --> 38:41.017
Where did he get it?

38:41.019 --> 38:43.586
He said someone
shoved it in his hand.

38:43.588 --> 38:44.921
Do you want me
to talk to him,

38:44.923 --> 38:47.390
see if I can get the truth?

38:47.392 --> 38:48.858
Tess?

38:48.860 --> 38:51.628
I am only here
because I need you to obey

38:51.630 --> 38:53.363
the rules of the experiment.

38:53.365 --> 38:54.698
The purity of the data.

38:57.936 --> 39:00.036
Here.
Take your toy back.

39:00.038 --> 39:01.037
Tess.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.906
Tess, you're special.

39:02.908 --> 39:05.108
What you did today
without instruction

39:05.110 --> 39:07.677
took the others nine months
of lucid dream training.

39:07.679 --> 39:09.579
You are the only one
in that room who matters.

39:09.581 --> 39:10.814
I will do whatever you want.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.082
I will get rid of levon.

39:12.084 --> 39:13.883
- Just stay.
- What happened to andy?

39:13.885 --> 39:15.485
The stroke rumor?

39:15.487 --> 39:18.054
Yeah, no, he's fine.

39:18.056 --> 39:19.656
Then where is he?

39:19.658 --> 39:22.525
He moved on.
He quit.

39:22.527 --> 39:24.127
Tess, I promise you.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.429
Andy did not stroke out.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.100
I know this is scary,

39:30.102 --> 39:32.068
but together
we can find your son.

39:35.073 --> 39:36.706
The problem with your phones?

39:36.708 --> 39:38.074
They're too perfect.

39:38.076 --> 39:40.410
The way they fit in my hand,
the interface,

39:40.412 --> 39:42.045
it's...it's perfect.

39:42.047 --> 39:44.748
Like your designers have been
inside my head.

39:44.750 --> 39:47.851
You know,
most people like that.

39:47.853 --> 39:50.453
I don't.

39:50.455 --> 39:52.789
Duly noted.

39:52.791 --> 39:54.424
This is one of your drills,
right?

39:54.426 --> 39:55.859
This isn't a drill.

39:55.861 --> 39:58.461
You always say that
and it's always a drill.

40:02.634 --> 40:04.401
Where is she?

40:04.403 --> 40:05.668
She was in the lobby.

40:05.670 --> 40:06.903
We had a conversation.

40:06.905 --> 40:08.705
And I looked for you.

40:08.707 --> 40:11.608
All I found was this.

40:13.412 --> 40:14.944
That's you.

40:18.850 --> 40:21.618
So it's a drill.
Right?

40:21.620 --> 40:24.020
- Yeah.
- Next time, give me a heads-up.

40:24.022 --> 40:26.956
My wife and I were supposed to
have drinks with the costellos.

42:30.315 --> 42:32.081
I'm sorry.

42:32.083 --> 42:33.917
You can close the door.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.588
<i>I know you're in there.</i>

43:13.692 --> 43:15.625

43:15.627 --> 43:16.993
Go away.

43:16.995 --> 43:18.695

43:21.099 --> 43:22.732

43:22.734 --> 43:24.968
Yeah, well, time's up.

43:24.970 --> 43:27.837

43:27.839 --> 43:29.639

43:29.641 --> 43:31.107
<i>He said he's gonna kick me out

43:31.109 --> 43:33.009

43:33.011 --> 43:34.310
<i>He won't say it's you, but...</i>

43:34.312 --> 43:36.646
I don't know anything
about that.

43:36.648 --> 43:38.281

43:41.286 --> 43:43.853

44:02.707 --> 44:04.307
<i>I'm not your goddamn dildo!</i>

45:15.180 --> 45:16.913
hi.

45:16.915 --> 45:19.048
I almost thought
you weren't coming.

45:21.453 --> 45:23.820
I couldn't get a cab.
