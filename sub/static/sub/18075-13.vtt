00:01.101 --> 00:04.135
[Man]
Ten years ago, a crack commando unit
was sent to prison by a military court...

00:04.226 --> 00:06.134
for a crime they didn"t commit.

00:06.226 --> 00:10.683
These men promptly escaped
from a maximum-security stockade
to the Los Angeles underground.

00:10.768 --> 00:14.762
Today, still wanted by the government,
they survive as soldiers of fortune.

00:14.852 --> 00:18.680
If you have a problem, if no one else
can help, and if you can find them...

00:18.769 --> 00:21.258
maybe you can hire... the A-Team.

02:03.860 --> 02:06.120
Hey! Keep 'em open!

02:11.569 --> 02:14.057
What do we got here?
Idiots?

02:31.195 --> 02:33.103
[Whispers]
It's a go.

02:33.195 --> 02:37.770
[Man On P.A.] Final call for Beller
Flight 2-6-7, now boarding at Gate Six.

03:10.656 --> 03:13.227
- We a go?
- Yeah, yeah. Everything's working out.

03:13.323 --> 03:16.606
- You got the parachutes?
- Yeah, yeah. You seen Jackson?

03:16.698 --> 03:20.278
You won't see him till you get on board.
Relax, now, will ya, bro?

03:20.365 --> 03:22.356
Let's go.

03:28.533 --> 03:30.488
That's on your right.

03:33.033 --> 03:35.024
That's on your left, sir.

03:36.075 --> 03:38.943
[Flight Attendant]
That"s to your right. To your left, sir.

03:39.033 --> 03:40.941
Welcome aboard, Private.
On leave?

03:41.034 --> 03:43.948
- Yeah. It's my first one.
- Well, I hope you enjoy your flight.

03:44.034 --> 03:45.776
I will.

03:45.867 --> 03:48.901
All right, everybody stay calm,
or this lady's gonna get it!

03:48.992 --> 03:51.860
- [Passengers Screaming]
- [Groaning]

03:53.576 --> 03:56.942
Go on!
Get outta here! Now!

03:57.035 --> 03:58.777
Get those passengers
in here right now!

03:58.868 --> 04:01.985
Move! Move!
In, in, in, in, in! Move!

04:02.077 --> 04:04.068
Come on! Bring her in!

04:10.244 --> 04:13.159
This is a freedom fighter
from the United People's Resistance.

04:13.244 --> 04:16.159
We have just commandeered
Beller Flight 2-6-7...

04:16.244 --> 04:19.776
and demand permission
for immediate take-off on runway 2-4.

04:19.870 --> 04:21.777
[Engines Starting]

04:21.870 --> 04:25.283
This is Beller Flight 2-6-7.
Priority clearance requested.

04:25.370 --> 04:28.736
[Controller] Permission for take-off
denied. Stand by.

04:29.912 --> 04:33.243
Beller 2-6-7 has been commandeered
by the United People's Resistance.

04:33.329 --> 04:37.537
You either clear us for immediate take-off,
or we starting shooting the passengers.

04:39.663 --> 04:41.986
[Beeping]

05:19.749 --> 05:22.747
[Man] As soon as you contact
Mr Beller, put the call right through.

05:24.041 --> 05:26.874
As soon as they gave us their demands,
they cut off radio contact.

05:26.958 --> 05:28.865
Have we been able to
reach Mr Beller yet?

05:28.958 --> 05:31.162
No, he's still fishing
off the coast of Greece somewhere.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.785
Then we're out of options.
We must call in the F.B.I.

05:33.875 --> 05:37.620
- You heard what they said. Call in the feds,
and they'll start killing the passengers.
- Calm down!

05:37.709 --> 05:42.911
You read the printout on Jackson.
The F.B.I. thinks he pulled that Brinks job
in Jersey last year. The guy's a nut job.

05:43.001 --> 05:45.287
Now he wants
$5 million in cash.

05:45.376 --> 05:47.414
Plus guaranteed passage to Libya.

05:47.501 --> 05:52.242
I say we give it to him. The replacement
cost on the jet alone is $50 million.

05:52.335 --> 05:55.250
- Plus all the bad publicity
we'll get out of this.
- We can't.

05:55.335 --> 05:57.242
Not without Beller's okay.

05:57.335 --> 05:59.243
Meanwhile, we can't
just sit on our hands.

05:59.335 --> 06:01.789
What about those guys
you told me about... the A-Team?

06:01.877 --> 06:03.785
I put out the word.

06:03.877 --> 06:07.954
I've got some contacts
in some Vietnam veteran activist groups,
but so far it's a dead end.

06:08.044 --> 06:09.952
I think they're
probably just a rumour.

06:10.044 --> 06:13.043
- Got an order from Sam's Deli.
Got a bacon and cheese...
- That's mine.

06:13.128 --> 06:15.035
There you go, pal.

06:15.128 --> 06:19.288
Oh! Right. And a tomato and turkey.
That's yours, sir.

06:19.378 --> 06:22.246
- Black coffee here.
- Coffee, black, for you, sir. Yes, sir.

06:22.337 --> 06:24.624
- Black coffee here.
- Black coffee right there.

06:24.712 --> 06:27.117
And there's coffee with cream.
Here's your cream, sir. Thank you.

06:27.212 --> 06:28.788
Sorry about that.

06:28.879 --> 06:31.119
What's the matter with you?
For cryin' out loud!

06:31.213 --> 06:33.915
We got some soda here.
You owe me $ 16.18.

06:34.004 --> 06:36.919
And I don't mind havin' a tip either,
pal. See ya later.

06:37.005 --> 06:39.244
Just a minute, mister!

06:39.338 --> 06:41.246
Got some soda here.
Great for stains.

06:41.338 --> 06:44.005
Stay away from me.
I don't want your help!

06:46.047 --> 06:49.081
- I thought you wanted to hire the A-Team.
- This is crazy.

06:49.172 --> 06:51.921
No, it isn't.

06:52.006 --> 06:54.921
Yes, it is!
[Quacking]

06:55.006 --> 06:58.502
It's crazy. [Continues Quacking]
It's very crazy.

06:59.881 --> 07:01.919
l"m crazy.

07:02.006 --> 07:06.001
You wanna see
how crazy I am, Doc?

07:08.215 --> 07:11.130
[lmitating Humphrey Bogart]
Don't be silly, pal. You're taking a fall.

07:11.215 --> 07:15.458
When a man's partner is killed,
he's supposed to do something about it.

07:15.549 --> 07:20.088
It's bad business to let a killer
get away with it... bad all around.

07:20.174 --> 07:22.544
Bad for detectives everywhere.

07:22.633 --> 07:25.750
[Quacking]
You see? I'm bananas, Doc.

07:25.842 --> 07:29.788
Murdock, you've been
institutionalized for 10 years.

07:29.883 --> 07:32.965
It"s only natural you don"t
want to be released. It"s scary.

07:33.050 --> 07:35.965
But I can assure you that I would not
release you from this hospital...

07:36.051 --> 07:39.298
unless I was absolutely certain
that you are just as sane as I am.

07:39.384 --> 07:42.299
[Barking, Growling]
G-Get down, Billy! Back! Back!

07:42.384 --> 07:45.299
I'd get outta here if I was you.
I don't know how long I can hold him off.

07:45.385 --> 07:47.624
Don't worry. We'll take
good care of your dog, Billy.

07:47.718 --> 07:50.123
I don't get it!

07:50.218 --> 07:53.300
I mean... No, ma'am,
I don't wanna eat my squash.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.625
[Gasps]
Oh, this is horrible.

07:55.719 --> 07:57.295
This is just horrible.

07:57.385 --> 08:00.135
I see a giant fish
eating the White House.

08:00.219 --> 08:02.126
That's a cute bit, Murdock.

08:02.219 --> 08:05.134
But, listen, why don't you
try reality for a while, huh?

08:05.219 --> 08:07.127
You're makin' a grave mistake,
General.

08:07.220 --> 08:10.134
Those tanks are up to their turrets
in mud. We gotta surrender...

08:10.220 --> 08:13.337
Come in for group anytime you have any
difficulty getting over the rough spots.

08:13.428 --> 08:19.010
Rough spots? I'm talkin' about
a major breakdown here... Doc!

08:19.095 --> 08:21.003
Oh, Murdock, Murdock.

08:21.096 --> 08:23.086
Ohh!

08:25.304 --> 08:27.295
You'll be fine, son.

08:37.222 --> 08:39.626
Don't give away my room, Doc.

08:39.722 --> 08:42.293
[Face] I think we"re giving
this one away, Hannibal.

08:42.389 --> 08:45.304
One percent of the ransom
comes to 50 grand.

08:45.389 --> 08:47.960
Our expenses have been
running higher than that.

08:48.056 --> 08:50.971
Beller can't afford any more.
The fuel crisis whacked him hard.

08:51.056 --> 08:53.971
Ah, so now we're in
the charity business.

08:54.056 --> 08:59.093
Face, don't you remember in '69 when
we had six days of "R" and "R" coming?

08:59.182 --> 09:02.096
Yeah. We tried to get that flight
out of Da Nang to Hawaii.

09:02.182 --> 09:03.924
Right.
All the flights were booked.

09:04.015 --> 09:06.930
Beller Air bumped two tourists,
and we got a flight out.

09:07.016 --> 09:08.757
We owe 'em this one.

09:08.849 --> 09:13.590
Uh, B.A., how long is it gonna
take you to get through the top
of the baggage compartment?

09:13.683 --> 09:17.298
- With the proper tools, about 20 minutes.
- It's gotta be quicker.

09:17.391 --> 09:22.594
I get those clowns off the ground,
all we can be thinking about is
a fast refuel and exchange of passengers.

09:22.683 --> 09:24.757
That's if they go
for the exchange.

09:24.850 --> 09:26.758
Oh, they will.

09:26.850 --> 09:30.097
We're gonna give them the president,
Edward Beller the Third...

09:30.184 --> 09:33.384
and the executive vice president
of Beller Air as hostages.

09:33.476 --> 09:36.889
- I thought nobody could get
in touch with Beller.
- Right.

09:37.893 --> 09:40.381
- [Car Horn Honking]
- Must be our pilot.

09:40.476 --> 09:42.384
I ain't flyin', Hannibal.

09:42.476 --> 09:45.475
B.A., you're gonna be
ground crew on this one.

09:45.560 --> 09:48.475
Your little red tennies
will never leave the asphalt.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.262
Answer the door.

10:06.186 --> 10:07.809
Where's Murdock?

10:08.853 --> 10:11.602
I had the field trip
to the newspaper office all set up.

10:11.687 --> 10:14.638
- I hope you didn't blow it, Amy.
- Murdock wasn't even at the hospital.

10:14.729 --> 10:17.431
When I got there, they were
moving his things out of his room.

10:17.521 --> 10:19.891
The front desk said the administration
had "made a change."

10:19.979 --> 10:24.103
What kind of a change
can they make with a dude like that,
aside from giving him a new brain?

10:24.188 --> 10:26.593
Hannibal,
that puts us in kinda deep.

10:26.688 --> 10:29.935
How are we gonna rescue a jet
without a pilot?

10:30.022 --> 10:32.936
Don't make no difference.
I ain't flyin' with that crazy fool anyway.

10:33.022 --> 10:34.929
[Car Horn Beeps]

10:35.022 --> 10:37.143
You guys tell anybody
about this place?

10:39.897 --> 10:41.888
It's all right.
Open 'em up.

10:41.981 --> 10:44.386
What am I, the doorman?

10:44.481 --> 10:47.396
[lmitates Buzzing Engine]

10:47.481 --> 10:50.847
[lmitates Screeching Tyres]

10:51.856 --> 10:55.139
Darn thing only gets
10 miles to the gallon.

10:55.232 --> 10:58.644
Murdock, we've got a situation here.

10:59.690 --> 11:01.930
[Sniffles]

11:02.024 --> 11:04.429
What's the matter, Captain?

11:05.899 --> 11:11.730
Colonel, I'm afraid I have some
terrible, terrible... terrible news.

11:11.816 --> 11:14.021
What happened?
Your dog Billy get hit by a car?

11:14.108 --> 11:16.063
Worse.

11:20.900 --> 11:23.602
[lmitating James Cagney]
I have been kicked out.

11:23.692 --> 11:26.097
Caine has been kicked out
of the harbour.

11:26.192 --> 11:29.523
So pull up the gangplanks, Mr Roberts,
and tell all the officers...

11:29.609 --> 11:32.180
to meet me in the wardroom.

11:32.276 --> 11:34.812
- You've been found sane.
- You got it.

11:35.735 --> 11:37.393
My career is over.

11:37.485 --> 11:40.815
No, it isn't.
We need you, Captain. Right now.

11:40.902 --> 11:44.481
You mean, we're goin'... up there?

11:44.569 --> 11:47.650
B.A., you take Murdock to the airport
and brief him on the way.

11:47.735 --> 11:51.433
Hey, man, why do I gotta be the one
always bein' stuck with this crazy fool?

11:51.527 --> 11:53.933
You go in as ground crew.

11:54.028 --> 11:57.310
When I talk that jet in,
stall the refuelling till we get aboard.

11:57.403 --> 11:59.310
Murdock'll help you
pull the floor paneling.

11:59.403 --> 12:01.808
I told you before...
I ain't goin' up.

12:01.903 --> 12:04.985
Just get Murdock on board.
Face, did you con us that limo?

12:05.070 --> 12:07.226
Chauffeur and all.

12:07.320 --> 12:09.228
All right.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.105
You know the plan.
Let's go, guys.

12:12.196 --> 12:14.519
- I think this is gonna work.
- It always works, Face.

12:14.612 --> 12:16.105
Git!

12:26.488 --> 12:28.609
Help us! Please, help us!

12:29.697 --> 12:32.612
You try that again, lady,
and you're dead!

12:32.697 --> 12:35.648
[Controller]
Beller 2-6-7, do you read? Over.

12:42.739 --> 12:44.896
This is Rourke, Thomas.
Open up.

12:47.365 --> 12:49.272
So, how they doin'?

12:49.365 --> 12:52.944
They're pretty freaked out,
but no one's panicking... yet.

12:53.032 --> 12:56.694
Well, when this sucker
hits the ocean, they'll panic.

12:57.699 --> 13:01.610
Beller Airways Flight 2-6-7
to Operations. Come in, Operations.

13:02.616 --> 13:04.772
This is Operations,
Beller Air 2-6-7.

13:04.866 --> 13:07.699
Switch to security channel
nine-delta.

13:11.075 --> 13:15.151
I want to talk to the man right now.
I'm losing patience.

13:15.242 --> 13:17.149
Where are those guys?

13:17.242 --> 13:20.027
Smith gave me his word
the A-Team will be here.

13:21.034 --> 13:25.324
Mr Beller's out raising
the rest of the five million.
He'll be with you as soon as he can.

13:25.409 --> 13:29.273
Well, he'd better get it. Otherwise we're
gonna turn this plane into a boat.

13:33.951 --> 13:37.448
[Allen] What am I supposed to do
while you guys are up in the air?

13:37.535 --> 13:39.940
You're our liaison on the ground.

13:40.035 --> 13:42.275
If Lynch gets a spotlight on us...

13:42.369 --> 13:44.774
we're gonna have to
get out of there quick.

13:44.869 --> 13:47.358
- So don't leave Beller operations room.
- Okay.

13:47.452 --> 13:49.360
I don't know, Colonel.

13:49.453 --> 13:53.150
This reminds me of the time
you fixed me up with that blind date
who turned out to be the general's wife.

13:53.245 --> 13:55.152
Now, now, Face.

13:55.245 --> 13:59.452
I'm Edward Beller the Third,
President of Beller Airlines.
You're my executive vice president.

13:59.537 --> 14:03.447
We give them the five million
and ourselves as hostages
when they turn over the passengers.

14:03.537 --> 14:07.613
Then we overpower them
and, uh, Murdock flies us home.

14:07.704 --> 14:10.157
Ah, we just overpower them.

14:10.246 --> 14:13.612
Right. We assume
an offensive posture.

14:13.704 --> 14:19.618
Military history has taught us
that conflict is merely the seizing
of space from one"s aggressor.

14:19.705 --> 14:24.030
They've got the space up there. We've
got the offensive posture down here.

14:24.122 --> 14:28.032
So, the two of us assume an offensive
posture against six guys with guns...

14:28.122 --> 14:30.955
in an aeroplane at 35,000 feet
over the ocean.

14:31.039 --> 14:34.037
Well, it's the application
of the theory that's interesting.

14:35.706 --> 14:39.119
I don't know. Do you think
you look enough like Beller?

14:39.206 --> 14:41.363
Of course I look
enough like Beller.

14:41.456 --> 14:44.703
- What's the name of the guard?
- Scotty.

14:45.790 --> 14:47.532
Watch Scotty.

14:53.874 --> 14:57.121
Good afternoon.
I got the big guy in back.

14:58.583 --> 15:02.493
- What do you say, Scotty?
How are the wife and kids?
- Just fine, Mr Beller.

15:02.583 --> 15:05.036
Good to see you, sir.

15:08.042 --> 15:10.032
[Knocking]

15:11.792 --> 15:15.205
I don't know, Larry. This guy
doesn't look a lot like Beller to me.

15:15.292 --> 15:17.698
Save the raves, friend.
You got the money?

15:17.792 --> 15:21.621
Miss Allen is part of the A-Team.
She'll be our liaison with the ground.

15:22.876 --> 15:25.791
If the feds are tipped,
we're gonna need some warning.

15:25.876 --> 15:29.740
There are couple of guys
in the military who'd like to
see us again... behind bars.

15:29.835 --> 15:32.750
- It's not that we don't trust you...
- But we don't trust anybody.

15:32.835 --> 15:35.240
- You talk to the hijackers?
- You said not to.

15:35.335 --> 15:38.168
Good. Get 'em on the radio.

15:41.211 --> 15:44.126
This is Operations
to Beller Air Flight 2-6-7.

15:44.211 --> 15:45.869
[Jackson]
Beller Air 2-6-7.

15:45.961 --> 15:48.532
This is Edward Beller.

15:48.628 --> 15:51.543
Well, finally.
You've got the money, pal?

15:51.628 --> 15:53.832
- [Hannibal] I have it.
- Good.

15:53.920 --> 15:58.624
Now, put us on a final approach,
and put the money in a fuel truck
at the end of the runway.

15:58.712 --> 16:03.832
We"ll pick up a full load of fuel,
and we"ll release the hostages
when we get to Libya.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.835
- No deal.
- Come on, now, pal.
Don't pull out on us now.

16:06.921 --> 16:08.959
We're prepared to dump this thing
in the ocean.

16:09.046 --> 16:11.001
We'll let you have the money...

16:11.088 --> 16:15.544
but we want an exchange of hostages...
Their safety is our first concern.

16:15.630 --> 16:17.537
You release the passengers...

16:17.630 --> 16:20.463
and myself and the vice president
of Beller Air...

16:20.547 --> 16:23.829
will come aboard
with the $5 million ransom.

16:23.922 --> 16:25.960
And what if I say no?

16:27.422 --> 16:30.374
You're running out of fuel, pal.

16:34.090 --> 16:36.376
That's it.
We don't say another word.

16:36.465 --> 16:39.961
- What if he doesn't buy it?
- He wants the money.

16:40.965 --> 16:45.623
[Jackson] This is Beller 2-6-7.
Clear us for immediate approach,
runway seven-right.

16:45.715 --> 16:48.667
2- 6-7 requesting
permission to land.

16:54.633 --> 16:56.623
Murdock, you drive.

17:08.384 --> 17:10.374
[Engine Starts]

17:13.134 --> 17:16.214
This is gonna be tough dropping
the paneling out of the monocoque.

17:16.300 --> 17:20.212
Got struts everywhere, and that opening
gonna be hard for you to squeeze through.

17:20.300 --> 17:24.710
[lmitating Marlon Brando]
Hey, I'll just shrink down
and squeeze through the cracks.

17:24.801 --> 17:28.132
- I thought you said
you wasn't crazy any more.
- Only on paper.

17:30.385 --> 17:33.965
Look, man, I want you to take
a long time fillin' up them wing tanks...

17:34.052 --> 17:35.960
'cause I'm gonna need
some time in there.

17:36.052 --> 17:39.465
I don't wanna wind up
in the sky in an aeroplane.

17:44.970 --> 17:49.343
[Controller] Beller 2-6-7,
taxi to end of runway seven-right.

17:56.054 --> 18:00.048
- Boy, oh, boy,
if there was ever a time...
- Don't get any ideas, Face.

18:00.137 --> 18:03.136
Well, they do say
every man has his price.

18:03.221 --> 18:05.626
And you think five million
might just be yours, huh?

18:05.721 --> 18:08.885
No, but it's real close.

18:09.805 --> 18:11.796
Not for me.

18:40.349 --> 18:42.968
[Jackson]
Here they are.

18:43.057 --> 18:46.055
All right, the two of you
come on up here real slow!

18:46.141 --> 18:48.676
And keep your hands clear!

19:08.642 --> 19:10.716
All right, that's him.
Come on.

19:19.477 --> 19:21.716
Is it there?
Okay.

19:21.810 --> 19:24.299
Get 'em in there, get the passengers out.
Come on.

19:26.977 --> 19:28.884
Get 'em out of here.

19:28.977 --> 19:31.300
- Come on! Move it! Let's go!
- Come on, come on.

19:43.103 --> 19:45.177
Get up here, fool.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.727
Beller Air Flight 267,
clear us for take-off.

19:50.812 --> 19:52.720
[Control Tower]
You"ll be cleared immediately, 2-6-7.

19:52.812 --> 19:55.727
We're gonna need more time
if we're gonna put
a full load of fuel onboard.

19:55.812 --> 19:58.218
We've got plenty of fuel
for where we're going.

19:58.313 --> 20:02.638
Clear us immediately on 24.
Repeat: priority clearing on 24.

20:02.730 --> 20:06.475
[Austrian Accent] Do you think
the patient is going to make it, Doctor?

20:06.563 --> 20:10.688
How you ever gonna make it
on the outside world if you
keep makin' a fool out yourself?

20:10.772 --> 20:12.478
I'm thinking about
a career in medicine.

20:12.564 --> 20:15.052
Only thing you should be doin'
with medicine is usin' it for your head.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.055
How much time do we have?

20:17.147 --> 20:19.387
- About half a tank.
- [Engine Starting]

20:20.564 --> 20:22.472
What's that?

20:22.564 --> 20:25.516
Um, sounds like... noise.

20:27.481 --> 20:29.058
Let me outta here!

20:29.148 --> 20:32.479
Don't!
Do you wanna kill yourself?

20:32.565 --> 20:34.556
If I gotta fly, I do!

21:06.443 --> 21:08.599
Hello!
Hello in there.

21:09.943 --> 21:14.849
Now, B.A., involuntary paralyzation is one
of the primary symptoms of panic anxiety.

21:14.943 --> 21:17.514
So just try to breathe deep.

21:19.569 --> 21:21.892
Okay, forget deep...

21:21.985 --> 21:23.976
and just try to breathe.

21:25.819 --> 21:28.853
[Austrian Accent]
Trust me! I am an expert in my field!

21:30.903 --> 21:34.648
# Pardon me, Roy
Is that the catatonic choo choo #

21:34.736 --> 21:37.142
Come on, man!

21:37.236 --> 21:39.725
Hannibal's got this whole thing
locked down!

21:44.737 --> 21:47.190
- Why don't I sit here?
- That ain't him, Jack.

21:49.737 --> 21:51.563
[Jackson]
lt"s just a make-up job.

21:59.571 --> 22:01.646
Seems you've lost some weight,
Mr Beller.

22:01.738 --> 22:04.985
- He's been sick.
- Yeah. I had a virus.

22:05.072 --> 22:06.979
Haven't been able to eat for weeks.

22:07.072 --> 22:10.319
Runny nose, infected ears,
mustache falls off.

22:10.406 --> 22:12.396
Who are you?

22:12.489 --> 22:15.819
We're a couple of
freelance Lone Ranger types.

22:15.906 --> 22:18.821
Beller hired us
to handle you guys.

22:18.906 --> 22:21.312
- "Lone Ranger types"?
- Yeah.

22:21.406 --> 22:23.444
All right.

22:24.573 --> 22:27.276
Go back to the luggage compartment
and get the parachutes.

22:27.365 --> 22:29.569
We"re bailing out just as soon
as we"re out of range of the radar.

22:29.657 --> 22:32.062
Unless you have wings,
you're dead.

22:32.157 --> 22:37.739
You and Tonto can crack your lousy jokes
as you go into the ocean.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.282
Get 'em up, Scout.

22:41.658 --> 22:44.656
Okay, B.A.,
if you can hear me, blink.

22:46.033 --> 22:48.190
Raise your eyebrow.

22:48.283 --> 22:52.112
Smirk. Smile. Wince!

22:52.200 --> 22:54.108
Come on, B.A.!

22:54.200 --> 22:57.566
If you stay like this, they're gonna stand
you in front of a bank holding a clock.

22:57.659 --> 22:59.650
[Grunts]

23:38.912 --> 23:41.910
- Darn airline's always
losing your luggage, isn't it?
- [Groans]

24:00.080 --> 24:03.909
- Think B.A. and Murdock pulled it off?
- I don't think so. Not enough time.

24:05.164 --> 24:08.660
Look, we may be
running out of road on this one.

24:08.747 --> 24:13.286
What are you, nuts? Cut the John Wayne
stuff. We're in real trouble here.

24:13.373 --> 24:15.908
- Get creative.
- My hands are tied.

24:15.998 --> 24:18.913
- Cuffed.
- [Sighs]

24:20.248 --> 24:22.654
[Grunts]
Okay, pal.

24:22.748 --> 24:25.154
Try to keep my friend
company here.

24:25.249 --> 24:29.159
He doesn't talk much,
but he's got a heck of a smile.

24:31.707 --> 24:35.120
Tommy, give me the heading
and coordinates, for the jump zone.

24:35.208 --> 24:37.245
I'm gonna put it
on automatic.

24:37.333 --> 24:39.868
Go for a 1-5-3 heading.

24:41.416 --> 24:44.331
Latitude's 23 degrees,
two minutes north...

24:44.417 --> 24:48.493
and longitude is 109 degrees,
59 minutes west.

24:49.584 --> 24:52.286
That's gonna put us right on the tip
of the Baja Peninsula.

24:52.376 --> 24:55.290
Good, 'cause we're bailing out
in about ten minutes.

24:55.376 --> 24:57.947
Our friends back there
are gonna go for a swim.

25:25.836 --> 25:28.669
[Sighs]
We're over the jump zone.

25:28.753 --> 25:31.668
- Where's Rourke?
- He's back getting the parachutes.

25:31.753 --> 25:35.250
He's taking his time too.
Why don't you give him a hand.

25:43.546 --> 25:45.951
You squeak,
and you're gonna leak.

25:46.046 --> 25:48.369
Now, real quiet, pal, move.

26:02.089 --> 26:04.080
[B.A. Moaning]

26:06.381 --> 26:09.912
Hey!
You got your porch lights on.

26:10.006 --> 26:11.878
Come on out of it, guy...

26:11.965 --> 26:15.461
- Slap me again, and I'll break your arm.
- Welcome back, man.

26:16.965 --> 26:18.872
- Where are we, man?
- You don't remember?

26:18.965 --> 26:22.212
Of course I don't remember, fool,
or I wouldn't be asking you.

26:22.299 --> 26:25.297
Well, we're about 36,000 feet,
travelling about 540 miles an hour...

26:25.382 --> 26:28.215
and I think we're going south
somewhere over Mexico.

26:29.174 --> 26:30.584
We in a plane?

26:30.674 --> 26:33.080
Take it easy!
Hannibal and Face are in trouble.

26:33.175 --> 26:36.089
They're being held hostage in the first
class compartment by those skyjackers.

26:36.175 --> 26:38.924
I don't remember any skyjackers.
I don't remember none of this.

26:39.008 --> 26:41.923
[Austrian Accent] Traumatic shock.
Memory loss is a primary symptom.

26:42.009 --> 26:44.165
- We in a plane?
- Don't panic.

26:44.259 --> 26:47.173
- We're in a plane! A plane!
- Don't panic. Take it easy!

26:47.259 --> 26:51.087
- A plane! A plane! A plane!
- Relax! Relax! Relax!
Relax! Don't... Don't...

26:51.176 --> 26:53.581
But stay angry,
you ugly mudsucker!

26:53.676 --> 26:55.750
We gotta help our unit!

26:55.843 --> 26:57.750
- [Growling]
- [Yells]

26:57.843 --> 27:01.754
We gotta come up with something.
There's at least three more of them,
and there's only two of us.

27:01.843 --> 27:03.751
And one of us is crazy.

27:03.843 --> 27:06.758
B.A., I'm gonna need the love and
support of all the friends I can get...

27:06.844 --> 27:08.751
and I want you to be my role model...

27:08.844 --> 27:11.759
somebody I can look up to when
the purple wobblies start to wobble.

27:11.844 --> 27:13.716
- Say what?
- Ah, forget it!

27:13.802 --> 27:15.877
You gotta come up
with some kind of plan!

27:15.969 --> 27:18.540
If you ain't crazy no more,
why don't you come up with a plan?

27:18.636 --> 27:24.385
Why don't you make up your mind!
First I'm crazy, then I'm not.
She loves me, she loves me not...

27:24.470 --> 27:26.377
Shut up, Murdock!
Shut up!

27:26.470 --> 27:30.546
Now, listen, I want you
to crawl up under the floor
and try to get a message to Hannibal.

27:30.637 --> 27:32.711
Okay.

27:33.471 --> 27:35.794
T.K.? Baker!

27:39.679 --> 27:41.670
Baker?

27:43.888 --> 27:45.879
- What's going on here?
- [Pistol Cocks]

27:48.347 --> 27:50.254
I'll check the bathroom
and the galley.

27:50.347 --> 27:52.338
Get those chutes up front.

28:14.140 --> 28:16.759
[Quiet Tapping]

28:16.849 --> 28:18.756
- [Whispering] Listen.
- [Tapping Continues]

28:18.849 --> 28:21.764
- What?
- Hear that tapping?

28:21.849 --> 28:23.757
I think it's Morse code.

28:23.849 --> 28:26.800
No, it sounds like something
broken in the hydraulic unit.

28:26.891 --> 28:28.799
No, it's Morse code.

28:32.058 --> 28:33.551
It's Murdock.

28:35.725 --> 28:37.965
"Go... to...

28:41.142 --> 28:42.469
lavatory."

28:42.559 --> 28:44.349
I can't.
I went before I left.

28:44.434 --> 28:47.847
Now who's making jokes?
We gotta get you to the bathroom.

28:47.934 --> 28:49.842
Sing.

28:49.934 --> 28:53.596
[Together]
# You are my sunshine #

29:11.061 --> 29:14.723
[lmitates Morse Code Beeping]

29:24.729 --> 29:26.636
- You see anything?
- Nothing.

29:26.729 --> 29:30.142
I don't like this. We started out,
we were six. Now we're down to four.

29:30.229 --> 29:32.136
People just don't disappear,
you know.

29:32.229 --> 29:34.635
Just grab those other chutes,
get 'em up front.

29:34.729 --> 29:38.640
- We gotta bail out this bird
while it still has fuel.
- What about T.K. and Baker?

29:38.730 --> 29:41.135
You wanna stay around
and look for 'em? Fine.

29:41.230 --> 29:44.228
I'm gettin' off this sucker
while it's still in the air.

29:45.730 --> 29:48.479
# You make me happy #

29:48.564 --> 29:50.471
# When skies are grey ##

29:50.564 --> 29:52.471
What's goin' on here,
dirtball?

29:52.564 --> 29:55.479
I wouldn't wave that
around, friend.

29:55.564 --> 29:58.811
Pressurized aeroplanes don't fly well
when they got holes in 'em.

29:58.898 --> 30:02.808
You put somebody else on board
this plane when we stopped and got fuel?

30:02.898 --> 30:05.303
Come on!
I ain't askin' you twice!

30:05.398 --> 30:09.060
I wanted to bring my pet cat,
but I didn't have a kitty carrier.

30:09.149 --> 30:11.554
Uh, now, how could we
get anybody on board?

30:11.649 --> 30:14.563
You guys were only
on the ground two minutes.

30:14.649 --> 30:18.892
Yeah, and I didn't have time
to go to the bathroom. Would you mind...

30:18.983 --> 30:21.897
Well, flying makes
my stomach nervous. l...

30:21.983 --> 30:24.732
Huh? Please?

30:24.816 --> 30:26.807
Take him to the john,
Price.

30:34.692 --> 30:36.683
I never
go to the bathroom.

30:39.859 --> 30:44.268
Ah, I, uh... I really can't
go with these on.

30:44.359 --> 30:47.855
Ah, come on. What am I gonna do,
flush myself down the toilet?

30:49.485 --> 30:51.476
Yeah.

30:52.652 --> 30:54.642
I appreciate this.

31:07.528 --> 31:09.435
J...

31:09.528 --> 31:12.526
- Hey, hurry it up!
- Hurry.

31:15.903 --> 31:18.024
Come on. Let's go.

31:20.195 --> 31:23.976
Shh. We don't want to
wake the passengers.

31:24.071 --> 31:25.812
[Grunting]

31:25.904 --> 31:28.191
Thom... Thomas!

31:30.946 --> 31:33.269
Move, and you're dead.

31:35.030 --> 31:37.104
I told you
about that gun, pal.

31:37.197 --> 31:40.776
You blow a hole in this bird, it'll
depressurize. Then we'll all go down.

31:42.197 --> 31:45.112
We got trouble out here.
Price just called for help.

31:45.197 --> 31:48.195
Grab the cash.
Let's get ready to bail out.

32:21.616 --> 32:23.524
[Yells]

32:23.617 --> 32:26.615
[Grunting]

32:27.700 --> 32:29.821
Oh! My eyes! My eyes!

32:29.909 --> 32:31.899
[Punches Landing]

32:44.118 --> 32:45.824
- Murdock, you okay?
- My eyes.

32:53.577 --> 32:55.982
It's a powder burn
when the gun discharged.

32:56.077 --> 32:59.858
- I can't see, man.
- You'll be all right, man.
I'll get you outta here.

33:10.037 --> 33:12.869
- Drop your gun!
- B.A., don't shoot!

33:41.622 --> 33:44.620
Hannibal, grab ahold
of my hand! Grab it!

33:45.623 --> 33:48.111
[Gasping]

33:49.373 --> 33:51.529
[Screaming]

33:53.290 --> 33:55.778
[Alarm Beeping]

34:03.124 --> 34:05.613
[Controller] There"s no response
from Flight 2-6-7.

34:08.708 --> 34:11.621
- How much fuel do they have left?
- Thirty minutes at most.

34:11.708 --> 34:14.623
They've been holding this pattern
for the last hour.

34:14.708 --> 34:18.868
I don't understand it.
Maybe the A-Team couldn't pull it off.

34:18.958 --> 34:20.866
They'll pull it off.

34:20.958 --> 34:22.866
With a tailwind, maybe.

34:22.958 --> 34:26.538
Considering the pattern that jet's
circling in, it's like nobody's flying it.

34:26.625 --> 34:29.197
[Alarms Beeping, Blaring]

34:31.626 --> 34:33.996
[B.A.] We"re gonna die, man.
We"re gonna die.

34:34.083 --> 34:38.458
Did any of you guys ever see that old
Doug McClure movie, Terror in the Sky?

34:38.543 --> 34:41.956
Shut up, Murdock. I ain't got time
for your crazy rap up here.

34:42.043 --> 34:46.914
No, McClure's in this plane, and the pilots
get ptomaine poisoning from the food.

34:47.002 --> 34:50.036
So he has to take the controls,
and the tower talks him in.

34:50.127 --> 34:52.793
- So?
- You guys ever fly anything?

34:54.002 --> 34:56.668
Kites. But that was
when I was a kid.

34:56.753 --> 34:59.076
I took an introductory flight once...

34:59.170 --> 35:02.831
where they let me hold the stick of
a single-engine for a couple of minutes.

35:02.920 --> 35:06.866
Well, Hannibal, you be my eyes,
and I'll bring this sucker home.

35:06.962 --> 35:10.577
- You're on.
- This is my worst nightmare.

35:10.670 --> 35:13.834
Cheer up, B.A.
Your insurance is up to date.

35:13.921 --> 35:15.579
Come on, Captain.

35:16.629 --> 35:18.869
Let me show you
how to fly this bird.

35:27.797 --> 35:30.202
Are you ready, Cap'n?

35:30.297 --> 35:32.620
I'm always ready.

35:34.714 --> 35:37.795
What can I say?
The man's on the jazz.

35:39.839 --> 35:43.252
Okay, um, there's a little gauge
to your right, and it might be flashing.

35:43.339 --> 35:45.745
- What does it say?
- "Fasten seat belts."

35:45.840 --> 35:48.589
- Not that one. The one next to it.
- Attitude indicator?

35:48.673 --> 35:51.209
- Uh, yeah. Give me the reading.
- In pitch or yaw?

35:51.298 --> 35:54.415
- How about English?
- Murdock, do you really know
how to fly this thing?

35:54.507 --> 35:57.873
Let me tell you, Colonel, when they turn
these babies over they all look alike.

35:57.965 --> 36:01.876
Listen, Murdock, I'm only gonna say this
once. Don't be messin' around up here.

36:01.966 --> 36:06.670
You tell Hannibal how to
get this thing down, 'cause I'm scared,
and when I'm scared I tend to get mean.

36:06.758 --> 36:10.373
- And you don't ever wanna see me mean.
- Secure that, Sergeant.

36:11.383 --> 36:14.417
- What"s next?
- Okay, we gon' fly this thing.

36:14.508 --> 36:16.962
Get on the radio
and contact the tower.

36:17.050 --> 36:21.423
Uh, Face, how much fuel we got left?
The gauge should be there on your right.

36:21.509 --> 36:23.299
And it should say "fuel."

36:25.217 --> 36:28.381
- Uh, 6,000, uh, pounds?
- That's about 13 minutes.

36:30.968 --> 36:35.044
Beller Operations, this is Beller
Flight 2-6-7. Do you read?

36:35.135 --> 36:38.133
This is Operations, 2-6-7.
Go ahead.

36:38.218 --> 36:41.335
This is Hannibal Smith.
We've secured your aircraft.

36:41.427 --> 36:44.176
- Great.
- But we"ve got one problem.

36:44.260 --> 36:48.550
Jackson, the other pilot on board,
was blown from the aeroplane.

36:48.636 --> 36:51.041
You should find him
somewhere over Tijuana.

36:52.428 --> 36:56.089
- What about your own pilot
you brought on board?
- Blinded in a firefight.

36:56.178 --> 36:59.129
We"re depressurized.
We"re running out of fuel.

37:00.512 --> 37:02.798
Have you had
any flight experience, Smith?

37:04.054 --> 37:06.589
Paper aeroplanes.
Does that count?

37:06.679 --> 37:10.091
Okay, Smith, just take 'er easy,
and we'll get right back to you.

37:10.179 --> 37:15.050
There is no way someone who has
not flown a heavy jet can land at L.A.X.

37:15.138 --> 37:19.048
One incident... one mess-up...
and he'll wipe out half the city.

37:19.138 --> 37:23.677
All right, Larry, what's normal standard
operating procedure in this situation?

37:23.763 --> 37:28.753
We give him a false heading
and send him into the ocean.

37:28.847 --> 37:31.252
- You can't do that!
- Look, lady...

37:31.347 --> 37:34.760
Smith doesn't have enough fuel
for us to talk him down by autopilot.

37:34.847 --> 37:37.134
He'll have to land that thing by stick.

37:37.223 --> 37:41.513
And there is one chance in 500
he can do that without incident.

37:41.598 --> 37:43.505
Now, we just can't risk it.

37:43.598 --> 37:47.130
I'm sorry, but we're gonna have to
send him into the ocean.

37:50.640 --> 37:52.548
Do it.

37:52.640 --> 37:55.555
Okay, Smith, uh, we're gonna
take you off autopilot.

37:55.641 --> 37:59.053
- You're gonna have to
fly this thing yourself.
- No kidding.

37:59.141 --> 38:01.297
Is your pilot
well enough to help you?

38:01.391 --> 38:04.591
- I'm here.
- Okay, Captain, he"ll be your eyes.

38:04.683 --> 38:06.508
Begin final approach procedure.

38:06.600 --> 38:09.267
Okay, grab hold of this baby.

38:09.350 --> 38:12.632
- Got 'er.
- Autopilot's off.

38:12.725 --> 38:14.930
- [Alarm Blaring]
- What's happening?

38:15.017 --> 38:18.181
Fly this thing, man. We goin' up,
and we supposed to be goin' down!

38:18.267 --> 38:20.673
Uh, the trim tab's under your thumbs.
Uh, up and down.

38:20.767 --> 38:23.766
- And, uh, wing level is your hands.
- Okay.

38:23.851 --> 38:26.256
Now, on your artificial horizon...

38:26.351 --> 38:29.266
below that is a white line that
cuts across the centre of the grid.

38:29.351 --> 38:31.259
Right.

38:31.352 --> 38:34.717
Put that small plane on the first line
below the centre line.

38:34.810 --> 38:36.386
Mm-hmm.

38:36.477 --> 38:38.717
Slowly push the yoke forward.

38:39.894 --> 38:42.892
- [Alarm Continues Blaring]
- What's next?

38:42.977 --> 38:46.806
I think maybe a short prayer and
a couple of warm goodbyes would be nice.

38:52.311 --> 38:55.807
I'm gonna send him into the ocean
just west of Catalina.

39:01.895 --> 39:03.970
- Okay, Captain, turn...
- Okay, listen straight.

39:04.062 --> 39:08.886
You tell Hannibal how to bring the jet
back to this airport, or I'll blow you away.

39:11.896 --> 39:14.266
Hannibal, this is Amy.

39:14.355 --> 39:17.518
I want you to double-check everything
these guys tell you with Murdock.

39:17.605 --> 39:19.512
What's going on, kid?

39:19.605 --> 39:22.805
- They"re trying to make you
crash in the ocean.
- [Face] What are we gonna do now?

39:27.064 --> 39:30.062
Now, you just help 'em
land this thing.

39:33.356 --> 39:36.271
Okay, Smith,
we're gonna bring you in V.F.R.

39:36.356 --> 39:40.397
- "V.F.R."?
- That's pilot talk. It just means
you're flying this baby on your own.

39:40.482 --> 39:42.686
Now, we"re gonna bank right.

39:42.773 --> 39:45.523
So turn the yoke right real slow.

39:59.108 --> 40:01.015
This is Captain H.M. Murdock.

40:01.108 --> 40:05.979
You wanna give me the, uh, headings
on our final approach,
and we'll get this sled in for ya.

40:07.817 --> 40:12.190
Murdock... turn right.

40:12.276 --> 40:15.357
Heading 0-6-niner.

40:15.442 --> 40:19.306
Okay, you wanna
keep that little plane...

40:19.401 --> 40:21.522
below the artificial horizon...

40:21.610 --> 40:27.144
and you just keep turning 'er until
you see zero-six-niner on the compass.

40:31.735 --> 40:33.892
Not so fast, Colonel.
Not so fast.

40:33.985 --> 40:37.730
You just do it real slow,
like you was dancin' with a big, fat girl.

40:37.819 --> 40:39.525
You got it?

40:42.486 --> 40:45.188
- I think so.
- All right, what's our airspeed?

40:45.278 --> 40:47.482
Uh... 225.

40:47.570 --> 40:50.354
- Altitude?
- 3,500.

40:50.445 --> 40:52.483
Can you find the flaps?

40:52.570 --> 40:54.975
- Yeah.
- Okay, give me one notch.

40:55.070 --> 40:57.310
One notch.

41:00.821 --> 41:04.980
- You see the one little green light?
- No.

41:09.363 --> 41:12.148
- Now I do.
- Landing gear is down.

41:12.238 --> 41:15.236
You should see the airport
out there on the coast.

41:19.114 --> 41:22.028
All right, give me one more notch.

41:22.114 --> 41:23.986
One more notch.

41:27.739 --> 41:29.695
We don't see any land, fellas.

41:30.740 --> 41:32.896
How much fuel have we got, Face?

41:32.990 --> 41:36.735
Uh, uh... 3,500 pounds.

41:36.823 --> 41:38.980
Oh... that's six minutes.

41:40.407 --> 41:43.986
You'll make visual contact
anytime now, Smith.

41:44.074 --> 41:46.230
Keep the yoke moving forward.

41:46.324 --> 41:49.322
Get the nose down.
You're gonna have to lose some altitude.

41:51.116 --> 41:53.818
If we lose any more altitude,
we're gonna be waterskiing.

41:53.908 --> 41:56.112
What is our altitude
and airspeed?

41:56.200 --> 42:00.110
Uh, 2,200 feet, 190 knots.

42:00.200 --> 42:02.653
All right, try to hold that.

42:04.284 --> 42:06.570
[Hannibal]
l"ve got visual contact.

42:06.659 --> 42:09.776
Uh, full flaps. Don't go below 140
on the airspeed, though.

42:09.867 --> 42:13.482
Full flaps.
I got, uh, 150.

42:13.576 --> 42:15.732
Bring the nose up a little.

42:15.826 --> 42:19.239
All right, clear that runway
and get some emergency units out there.

42:19.326 --> 42:22.408
We've only got enough fuel
to do this once, and we're coming in.

42:22.493 --> 42:25.859
Get our emergency units
out to runway seven-right.

42:25.952 --> 42:28.736
Face, if we crash...

42:29.827 --> 42:31.948
We gonna crash!
We gonna crash!

42:32.036 --> 42:34.322
Face, get him off me!
Get him off me!

42:42.286 --> 42:44.905
Sorry, fellas.
I lost my head.

42:49.537 --> 42:52.072
- Fasten your seat belts.
- Keep the nose down!

42:52.162 --> 42:54.567
[Alarm Blaring]

42:54.662 --> 42:56.985
Uh, I, uh...
I think we"re about out of fuel.

42:57.079 --> 42:59.994
[Engine Decelerating]

43:00.079 --> 43:02.402
Yeah, we're
definitely out of fuel.

43:02.496 --> 43:05.827
- [Murdock] Altitude?
- One hundred feet.

43:05.913 --> 43:08.236
[Alarm Continues Blaring]

43:08.330 --> 43:12.988
When you think you're gonna
hit the runway, you pull back
on that yoke as hard as you can.

43:14.997 --> 43:17.568
Okay, stand by.

43:17.664 --> 43:20.579
Stand by.

43:21.998 --> 43:24.486
Here we go.

43:29.623 --> 43:33.036
Forward!
Go forward with that yoke!

43:33.123 --> 43:36.785
Reverse your thrusters!
Get on the brakes, Smith!

43:36.874 --> 43:38.497
- Hit the brakes!
- Where are they?

43:38.582 --> 43:40.703
I got 'em!

43:41.999 --> 43:44.037
Okay, get your heads down!

43:54.500 --> 43:58.162
Maybe they'll let me fly one of these birds,
now that I'm not crazy any more.

43:58.250 --> 44:00.324
See, B.A.?
Flying isn't so bad.

44:01.875 --> 44:04.660
Hello. B.A.?

44:05.792 --> 44:08.328
I love it
when a plan comes together.

44:14.918 --> 44:17.751
It's been almost a week,
and I still ain't recovered from that.

44:17.835 --> 44:19.826
- Me neither.
- How's the swelling?

44:19.918 --> 44:22.833
Oh, it's goin' down.
I can see all right now.

44:22.919 --> 44:25.324
I hope I never see you again.

44:25.419 --> 44:30.242
By the way, B.A., I thought
that now that I'm not nuts any more,
maybe you and I could room together.

44:33.294 --> 44:37.241
On the other hand,
good fences do make good neighbours.

44:38.336 --> 44:42.165
- How'd we make out, Face?
- How'd we make out? Lousy.

44:42.253 --> 44:44.707
One percent of the ransom.
Fifty thousand dollars, right?

44:44.795 --> 44:47.995
Split that five ways,
that's 10 grand apiece.

44:48.087 --> 44:53.041
Now, we each put half of our take
into our retirement programmes
and hold back a third for taxes.

44:53.129 --> 44:56.246
[Allen]
Since when are we paying taxes?

44:56.338 --> 44:58.245
[B.A.]
We don"t pay taxes.

44:58.338 --> 45:01.585
Various expenses... fees, insurance,
medical, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

45:01.671 --> 45:04.835
That leaves us with $236.

45:04.922 --> 45:07.836
- Apiece?
- No, no, no. All together.

45:09.255 --> 45:11.542
[Sighs]

45:13.422 --> 45:16.255
We're almost there,
Murdock.

45:20.423 --> 45:24.334
Now, go in there and get your stuff.
Don't mess around.

45:24.423 --> 45:27.338
You know, I'm really
gonna miss this place...

45:27.423 --> 45:29.295
and those warm nights
in post-shock...

45:29.382 --> 45:32.297
carvin' birds out of soap
with blunt Popsicle sticks.

45:32.382 --> 45:35.380
Well, they ain't gonna miss you.
Now get goin'.

45:41.424 --> 45:43.332
Hi, Doc.

45:43.424 --> 45:48.710
Murdock! I want you to tell
these gentlemen that I am an emissary
from the planet Fargo...

45:48.800 --> 45:53.339
and that I am here
to release Commander Gutar
from the enemies of the Dark Star.

45:53.425 --> 45:55.748
- Huh?
- You Murdock?

45:55.842 --> 45:58.757
- Sometimes.
- We've been looking
all over for you, chief.

45:58.842 --> 46:01.757
Now, Dr Nutball here
released all of his patients.

46:01.842 --> 46:06.500
[lmitating Richard Burton]
No! My good sir, this doctor
has released me because I'm sane!

46:06.593 --> 46:09.508
- I have papers and everything!
- Just take it easy.

46:09.593 --> 46:12.082
No! No! Tell 'em!
Tell 'em, Doc! Tell 'em!

46:12.177 --> 46:16.087
Oh, I've tried!
But these men do not speak the code!

46:16.177 --> 46:19.839
They are ignorant
of the ways of our galaxy!

46:19.927 --> 46:22.463
- What galaxy?
- Our galaxy.

46:23.469 --> 46:25.376
Courage, Murdock!

46:25.469 --> 46:27.875
Let me show you
my release papers.

46:27.969 --> 46:31.584
You see? "Sane."
S-A-N-E!

46:31.678 --> 46:35.506
Sound! Sensible!
Wise! Rational!

46:35.595 --> 46:40.253
Lucid! Prudent! Reasonable!

46:41.387 --> 46:43.378
[Murdock]
Home! Home at last!
