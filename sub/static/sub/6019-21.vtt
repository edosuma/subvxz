00:04.240 --> 00:05.992
The concept of being separated
is strange.

00:06.160 --> 00:07.991
It's like you're engaged
to be divorced.

00:08.160 --> 00:11.197
"We're gonna try and make
not being together work.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.999
First we were separated, then we met,
then we were together.

00:14.160 --> 00:16.071
Now we're gonna try
being separated again.

00:16.239 --> 00:19.676
We think actually some sort of giant
rubber band might be the solution."

00:19.840 --> 00:21.592
Of course, when you were
a kid in school...

00:21.760 --> 00:23.955
...you'd get separated
for having too good a time.

00:24.120 --> 00:26.395
"lf you two kids don't stop laughing
and having fun...

00:26.560 --> 00:28.391
...I'm gonna have to separate you."

00:29.080 --> 00:31.355
Then the kid finds out his parents
are breaking up...

00:31.520 --> 00:35.274
...thinks it's because they got caught
fooling around, which is probably true.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.831
-Hairdo?
-Yeah.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.195
You look like Brenda Starr.

00:46.920 --> 00:49.514
-ls that good?
-Better than Dondi.

00:51.120 --> 00:53.111
Hey, my God, look at that.

00:53.280 --> 00:54.872
It's David and Beth Lukner.

00:55.040 --> 00:58.555
You know, I heard a rumour
their marriage is a little rocky.

00:58.720 --> 01:01.598
Really? You know, I have
a little thing for Beth Lukner.

01:01.760 --> 01:03.113
Well....

01:03.280 --> 01:07.910
I have to admit I've always thought
David was kind of sponge-worthy.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.272
Yeah, I've been waiting out
their marriage for three years.

01:12.440 --> 01:15.034
Me too. Well, I've been waiting out
two or three marriages...

01:15.200 --> 01:17.395
...but this is the one I really
had my eye on.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.591
This car out there is taking up
like three parking spaces.

01:21.760 --> 01:23.352
That's mine.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.792
-You have a car?
-My friend lent it to me for the week.

01:26.960 --> 01:28.951
-She's out of town.
-I've never seen you drive.

01:29.120 --> 01:30.712
-Me neither.
-Jerry?

01:30.880 --> 01:33.713
-Elaine, hi.
-Hi, David.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.029
Hi, Beth.

01:35.840 --> 01:38.035
Oh, George,
this is my husband, David.

01:38.200 --> 01:39.519
-Oh, hi, David.
-Hello.

01:39.680 --> 01:42.148
George, you're the one who works
for the Yankees, right?

01:42.320 --> 01:43.639
Yeah. Why, what do you do?

01:43.800 --> 01:46.951
Well, I sell insurance, but Beth
used to be Don Mattingly's doctor.

01:47.120 --> 01:48.314
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:49.280 --> 01:51.669
A physician married to a salesman.

01:51.840 --> 01:54.752
I gotta tell you, Beth, you could have
done a lot better than him.

02:03.360 --> 02:05.271
-Hey.
-Hey. Hey, Mickey, what's going on?

02:05.440 --> 02:08.193
I'm nervous. I'm auditioning to be
in the Actors Studio tonight.

02:08.360 --> 02:12.148
-Really?
-It's Method, Jerry. It's intense.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.276
-Kramer's my scene partner.
-Kramer?

02:14.440 --> 02:15.839
He doesn't have to say anything.

02:16.000 --> 02:18.116
He just has to sit there.
I'm playing a detective.

02:18.280 --> 02:20.236
I'm playing a businessman
accused of murder.

02:20.400 --> 02:21.753
Oh, boy.

02:21.920 --> 02:23.956
I gotta meet Elaine
and run some errands, so....

02:24.480 --> 02:25.833
Look at this, Mickey.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.353
These pants are falling apart.

02:27.520 --> 02:29.875
When I met you, you used
to wear jeans all the time.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.598
Well, I was a different man then.

02:31.760 --> 02:33.751
With a different body.

02:34.640 --> 02:39.953
Hey, I got the body of a taut,
preteen Swedish boy.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.671
I don't know.

02:43.840 --> 02:46.957
What are you thinking? You think that
I'm not able to wear jeans anymore?

02:47.120 --> 02:50.556
Is that what you're saying?
Because I'll go and I'll buy some jeans.

02:51.960 --> 02:54.030
I swear to God, I will.

02:54.480 --> 02:56.072
Don't think I won't, Jerry.

02:58.080 --> 03:00.310
All right. That's it.

03:02.880 --> 03:05.519
God, it is so great to drive again.

03:05.680 --> 03:08.035
I miss it so much.

03:08.640 --> 03:11.996
How about a left turn signal,
you moron!

03:13.440 --> 03:14.998
I'm so nauseous.

03:15.160 --> 03:16.639
She's the worst driver.

03:16.800 --> 03:20.395
You know what,
on my first road test, I hit a dog.

03:21.880 --> 03:23.359
I think it was a golden retriever.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.431
No, no, no, it was a yellow lab.

03:26.440 --> 03:28.635
I gotta check my messages.

03:31.040 --> 03:32.439
Hey.

03:33.160 --> 03:34.991
I'm so carsick I'm gonna vomit.

03:35.680 --> 03:36.874
Oh, my God, Jerry.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.512
My friend Kim called.

03:39.680 --> 03:41.750
David and Beth
got separated last night.

03:41.920 --> 03:44.639
-Yeah?
-They're getting divorced!

03:50.280 --> 03:52.430
So now, what is our move?
What do we do?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.397
I don't know,
but we don't have much time.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.790
City's teeming with people
waiting out that marriage.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.234
Right.

03:58.400 --> 04:00.868
It's like when a tenant dies
in a rent-controlled building.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.712
You gotta take immediate action.

04:03.120 --> 04:05.554
But David and Beth are gonna need
their grieving time.

04:05.720 --> 04:08.359
Their grieving time is a luxury
I can't afford.

04:08.520 --> 04:11.080
I'm calling Beth tonight,
and if you want a shot at David...

04:11.240 --> 04:12.798
-...I suggest you do likewise.
-Yeah.

04:12.960 --> 04:15.633
But we gotta make it seem like
we're not calling for dates.

04:15.800 --> 04:17.438
Then why are we calling?

04:18.160 --> 04:21.072
-Good question. Why are we calling?
-Why are we calling?

04:21.240 --> 04:25.279
-Calling, calling, calling.
-Why are we calling? Why do we call?

04:27.200 --> 04:29.191
I got it. I've got it.

04:29.360 --> 04:32.477
We're calling just to say;

04:32.640 --> 04:35.598
"I'm there for you."

04:36.280 --> 04:37.759
I'm there for you.

04:37.920 --> 04:41.469
Then, after a period
of being there for you...

04:41.640 --> 04:46.077
...we slowly remove
the two words "for you"...

04:46.240 --> 04:49.915
...and we're just there.

04:50.960 --> 04:52.154
-Hey.
-Hey.

04:52.320 --> 04:54.072
Remember Beth and David
from yesterday?

04:54.240 --> 04:56.310
-They got separated.
-Really?

04:57.320 --> 05:00.790
Well, you don't think it had anything
to do with what I said, do you?

05:02.520 --> 05:03.669
What did you say?

05:03.840 --> 05:06.912
You know, that thing
about her being too good for him.

05:07.080 --> 05:10.675
I mean, I was just being folksy.
They could tell I was being folksy?

05:10.840 --> 05:13.718
-Yeah, I thought you were being folksy.
-Totally folksy.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.591
Hey....

05:44.960 --> 05:46.712
-What did you get?
-I bought dungarees.

05:47.800 --> 05:49.916
Kramer, they're painted on.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.632
Well, they're the slim fit.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.438
-Slim fit?
-Yeah, they're streamlined.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.309
You're walking like Frankenstein.

05:59.240 --> 06:01.959
They just gotta be worked in
a little bit, that's all.

06:03.080 --> 06:04.559
See you.

06:07.200 --> 06:10.556
Well, David, it happens.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.518
Sure, Beth, these things happen.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.797
So have you told many people yet?

06:16.960 --> 06:19.633
Because it's really
nobody's business.

06:19.800 --> 06:22.360
Anyway, I just called
to tell you that...

06:22.520 --> 06:24.476
...I'm there for you.

06:24.960 --> 06:27.155
There is...

06:27.600 --> 06:30.160
...anywhere you want me to be.

06:30.320 --> 06:31.992
Sure. Dinner would be fine.

06:32.160 --> 06:35.994
And I can just be there for you.

06:37.080 --> 06:38.832
-Jerry, you gotta help me.
-What's wrong?

06:39.000 --> 06:41.719
I can't get my pants off.
Mickey's audition is in 20 minutes.

06:41.880 --> 06:44.235
I'm supposed to be a businessman.
I gotta be in costume.

06:44.400 --> 06:46.709
All right. Undo them,
I'll help you get them off.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.917
-I already did, and it won't come off.
-You just gotta wiggle your hips.

06:50.080 --> 06:51.638
Pull down.

06:53.920 --> 06:55.558
All right. All right.
That's no good.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.676
Let me try getting them
from the bottom.

06:57.840 --> 06:59.353
Just give me....

06:59.520 --> 07:02.080
Wait. Jerry, wait a minute.

07:02.240 --> 07:04.390
Man, these are tight.

07:04.560 --> 07:07.393
-Squinch your hips in.
-I am squinching my hips.

07:07.600 --> 07:09.033
Keep squinching them.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.309
All right, that's not gonna work.
That's not gonna work.

07:14.480 --> 07:16.710
Let me just think for a second here.

07:16.880 --> 07:18.916
You better get me.

07:22.920 --> 07:24.876
Get me up, get me up.

07:25.040 --> 07:26.712
Hold it, hold it, hold it.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.917
Look, you're gonna need the
Jaws of Life to get out of those things.

07:30.080 --> 07:31.718
I don't have time.
I'm gonna be late.

07:31.880 --> 07:34.872
-Maybe you could soak in a tub.
-You better get the door.

07:45.520 --> 07:46.873
It was nice to get your call.

07:47.200 --> 07:50.237
Well, I just want you to know
I'm there for you.

07:50.480 --> 07:51.959
Of course, now I'm here for you...

07:52.120 --> 07:54.350
...but when I'm not here for you,
I'm there for you.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.918
Well, wherever you are,
I appreciate it.

07:58.080 --> 07:59.354
So how did this all happen?

07:59.920 --> 08:03.674
Well, actually, it had a lot to do
with George's comment.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.436
-ls that right?
-I thought maybe I could do better.

08:10.640 --> 08:12.073
Maybe, maybe.

08:12.240 --> 08:13.719
Well, it wasn't just that.

08:13.880 --> 08:15.677
I realized after
three years of marriage...

08:15.840 --> 08:18.229
...that David's little quirks
were getting on my nerves.

08:18.400 --> 08:21.517
Three years is a long time
to be married.

08:24.640 --> 08:28.713
In the middle of our fight last night,
he did this thing that he always does...

08:28.880 --> 08:31.713
...where he asks questions
to himself aloud...

08:31.880 --> 08:33.073
...and then answers them.

08:33.240 --> 08:36.630
Am I happy Beth left me?
Of course not.

08:36.799 --> 08:39.519
Can I hope to pick up the pieces
and move on? Absolutely.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.355
You're gonna pick up the pieces.

08:42.520 --> 08:44.556
We just had
our third anniversary on April 8th.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.675
-Tenth.
-Right.

08:45.840 --> 08:47.114
Right.

08:48.960 --> 08:53.431
You know, as far as I'm concerned,
this whole thing is George's fault.

08:53.600 --> 08:57.275
Well, David, the thing
about George is that...

08:57.440 --> 08:59.670
...he's an idiot.

09:02.360 --> 09:05.193
All right. Auditioning next
is Mickey Abbott...

09:07.040 --> 09:09.190
...doing a scene from
the Terence Klufer play...

09:09.360 --> 09:10.713
...Flesh Wounds in Ithaca.

09:13.200 --> 09:15.509
I'm sorry, my scene partner
isn't here yet so I guess--

09:18.240 --> 09:19.878
-Sorry I'm late.
-What's with the jeans?

09:20.040 --> 09:21.553
-You're a businessman.
-Long story.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.517
Well, just get up here.

09:32.320 --> 09:35.357
So, Bradley...

09:35.520 --> 09:38.318
...I guess this is the last place
you expected to find yourself.

09:38.480 --> 09:41.438
Well, we're gonna be here a while,
so take a seat.

09:47.760 --> 09:50.069
If it hadn't been
for that secretary of yours....

09:50.600 --> 09:51.953
I said, sit down.

09:54.480 --> 09:57.119
Are you deaf, Bradley?
I said, sit down.

09:59.640 --> 10:03.076
Bradley, it's very important
that you sit down.

10:04.680 --> 10:06.352
Now, for the last time...

10:06.520 --> 10:10.399
...try again to sit down!

10:10.560 --> 10:13.279
Sit down, you big, stupid ape!

10:18.080 --> 10:20.640
Did I have a great time with
David Lukner last night?

10:21.080 --> 10:22.229
I sure did.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.956
Do I think there's a future here?

10:26.120 --> 10:27.792
I don't see why not.

10:27.960 --> 10:33.353
I'll tell you, that "there for you" crap
was a stroke of genius.

10:34.240 --> 10:36.196
-Oh, please.
-Never mind.

10:36.360 --> 10:37.634
-Oh, come on.
-You're a genius.

10:37.800 --> 10:39.153
All right.

10:40.080 --> 10:41.593
Hey.

10:41.760 --> 10:44.228
-Georgie!
-Hey, there he is!

10:44.400 --> 10:46.630
Georgie boy!

10:49.160 --> 10:50.639
-What's going on?
-What's going on?

10:50.800 --> 10:52.950
You're the man of the hour,
that's what's going on.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.394
-Right.
-What do you mean?

10:54.560 --> 10:57.791
Well, thanks to you and your little
comment there to David and Beth...

10:57.960 --> 11:00.474
...Jerry and l
are in prime pouncing position...

11:00.640 --> 11:05.077
...to scoop these two up
before they know what hit them.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.871
So it was my comment
that broke them up?

11:10.080 --> 11:11.832
-According to them.
-Yeah.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.956
I feel terrible.

11:14.120 --> 11:16.793
I can't be responsible
for breaking up a marriage.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.313
-Oh, no.
-Where are you going?

11:18.480 --> 11:20.072
Well, I gotta go talk to Beth.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.151
-Talk to Beth?
-I gotta undo what I did.

11:22.320 --> 11:24.470
You're not undoing anything.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.631
-Oh, yes, I am.
-Oh, no, you're not.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.472
All right, get out of my way.

11:30.920 --> 11:33.514
All right, don't make me
get physical here!

11:34.720 --> 11:36.438
You be careful, George.

11:48.160 --> 11:51.038
-George.
-Hi, Beth.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.595
Anyway, Jerry told me that...

11:58.760 --> 12:02.230
...it might have been my comment
in the coffee shop that broke you up.

12:03.520 --> 12:05.078
Well, you know,
it's funny, George...

12:05.240 --> 12:07.993
...sometimes you don't know
how you're feeling about something...

12:08.160 --> 12:11.197
...until a person like you comes along
and articulates it so perfectly.

12:12.000 --> 12:13.752
Articulate?

12:14.200 --> 12:18.079
Me? I've never articulated anything.
I'm completely incoherent.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.312
I don't know about that.

12:20.480 --> 12:23.074
Hold on. Hello.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.673
Hi.

12:24.840 --> 12:27.832
Yeah, last night. I did too.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.878
Really? That's so funny,
he's here right now.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.792
Can you put him on?
I'd love to say hello.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.633
Sure. George, it's Jerry.

12:35.840 --> 12:37.671
-He wants to talk to me?
-Yeah.

12:37.840 --> 12:40.957
-He says he wants to say hello.
-Sweet guy.

12:46.560 --> 12:48.152
Hello?

12:48.560 --> 12:50.198
What the hell are you doing
over there?

12:50.360 --> 12:52.794
Mind your own business.
Now, stay out of my affairs!

12:52.960 --> 12:54.791
Jerry, Jerry,
that is so sweet of you...

12:54.960 --> 12:56.951
...but actually, I already ate.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.872
Ate? What the hell
are you talking about?

12:59.040 --> 13:00.837
Listen to me.
Get out of that apartment.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.669
-lf you screw this up for me, I swear--
-Chocolate chip mint?

13:06.040 --> 13:08.190
Actually, Jerry,
I prefer chocolate chip.

13:08.360 --> 13:10.555
What is it about the chocolate
and the mint...

13:10.720 --> 13:12.915
...that makes it go so well together?

13:13.360 --> 13:16.158
-What are you talking about?
-Oh, of course you can use it. Sure.

13:16.320 --> 13:19.756
-Okay. Bye-bye.
-Don't hang up on me, George, I--

13:24.520 --> 13:26.476
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.915
Are you still wearing those things?

13:29.080 --> 13:30.229
Oh, yeah.

13:30.400 --> 13:32.960
Yeah, I think they're starting
to loosen up a bit.

13:35.200 --> 13:37.760
-Oh, hi, Mrs. Zanfino.
-Kramer, would you do me a favour?

13:37.920 --> 13:40.957
My babysitter hasn't shown up.
Could you watch Joey for an hour?

13:41.120 --> 13:42.155
Yeah, sure, Mrs. Zanfino.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.914
He's sleeping already.
You don't have to do anything.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.595
-See you later, buddy.
-See you later.

13:50.400 --> 13:52.311
-Hello?
-Hi, Jerry. It's Beth.

13:52.480 --> 13:54.357
-Oh, hi, Beth.
-Hi.

13:54.560 --> 13:56.551
I've been doing
a lot of thinking today...

13:56.720 --> 13:59.473
...and I don't know,
maybe I made a huge mistake.

13:59.800 --> 14:02.872
-George.
-I'm just feeling very confused.

14:04.440 --> 14:07.512
-I'll call you back, okay?
-Okay.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.549
-Trouble.
-What?

14:09.720 --> 14:11.039
-George. Yeah.
-ls it? Damn.

14:11.200 --> 14:12.633
-What do we do?
-What do we do?

14:12.800 --> 14:14.711
You get your ass
over to Beth's tout de suite.

14:14.880 --> 14:17.348
Turn on some of that so-called charm
you tell me about.

14:17.680 --> 14:20.797
-Yeah, I can try and do that.
-You don't try, you do it.

14:20.960 --> 14:23.997
I got the loser in this relationship.
I'm breathing new life into him.

14:24.160 --> 14:26.720
Give me three more days,
he won't remember her name.

14:26.880 --> 14:28.393
You got the winner, the easy part.

14:28.600 --> 14:30.636
Let's go. I'll drive you over there.
Come on.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.633
-You go on ahead. I'll take the bus.
-What? I'm parked outside.

14:33.800 --> 14:36.234
-I'll take the subway.
-lt doesn't matter. I'll take you.

14:36.400 --> 14:38.038
-I can hitchhike.
-What's your problem?

14:38.200 --> 14:40.236
-It's really not necessary.
-What's your problem?

14:54.920 --> 14:56.592
The....

14:56.760 --> 14:59.035
The shoelaces
that you bought me...

14:59.200 --> 15:01.111
...they worked out well.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.628
Well, you know,
if you need some more...

15:04.800 --> 15:06.791
...I can get them for you.

15:07.960 --> 15:10.349
It should be a while, though.

15:16.640 --> 15:18.517
That was close.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.032
Confide in her. Open up to her.

15:23.200 --> 15:24.394
You know, women like that.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.916
I don't feel so good.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.954
Anyway, Beth....

15:29.120 --> 15:31.031
You know, I was thinking
on my way over...

15:31.200 --> 15:34.397
...how when I was 9,
I wanted these handball sneakers.

15:34.560 --> 15:35.913
They were all black.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.469
But they only came in adult sizes.

15:39.360 --> 15:43.638
So, you know,
I never got the sneakers.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.119
Oh, really?

15:47.280 --> 15:49.510
My father left us when I was 9...

15:49.680 --> 15:53.275
...so I guess that's why
I have such a fear of abandonment.

15:53.440 --> 15:56.557
-Wow, that's so touching.
-Yes, it is.

15:58.200 --> 16:00.634
Hey, it's George.

16:00.800 --> 16:03.109
Oh, maybe we should go
someplace else.

16:03.280 --> 16:04.474
No, let's go in.

16:08.640 --> 16:12.349
-Oh, hi. Hi, David.
-Hi, George.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.476
-Elaine.
-Hi.

16:14.640 --> 16:17.757
Listen, David, I want to apologize
about that comment--

16:17.920 --> 16:20.150
George, please, please. I'm fine.

16:20.320 --> 16:21.912
Oh, yeah, this is my fiancée.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.718
-Susan, this is David.
-David.

16:23.920 --> 16:27.435
Oh, fiancée? Boy, you could've
done a lot better than him.

16:29.920 --> 16:32.150
Come on, Elaine, let's go.

16:58.400 --> 17:00.994
It's Frankenstein! It's Frankenstein!

17:01.160 --> 17:02.673
Joey.

17:03.560 --> 17:04.753
Joey.

17:04.920 --> 17:09.755
Mickey, you were so incredible
in that scene yesterday.

17:09.920 --> 17:11.637
-The rage.
-Right.

17:11.800 --> 17:13.676
The rage. Tons of rage.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.037
I don't believe this.

17:22.000 --> 17:23.194
-Hello.
-Mickey.

17:23.359 --> 17:24.509
Oh, hi, Kramer.

17:24.680 --> 17:27.273
-What do you want? I'm busy.
-You gotta do me a favour.

17:27.440 --> 17:30.034
-What? Now? I can't.
-Hey, you owe me.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.593
I got you in the Actors Studio.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.432
They thought what we did
was the scene.

17:33.600 --> 17:35.909
All right, all right. I'll be right over.

17:38.480 --> 17:39.993
You ready?

17:41.600 --> 17:43.397
You know what, George...

17:43.560 --> 17:45.391
...why don't you go ahead.

17:45.760 --> 17:48.320
I think I'd like
to be alone for a while.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.353
Oh, sure.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.034
Sure, you want to be alone?
Sure, I understand that.

17:53.200 --> 17:55.555
You want a little time to think?
Think. Ponder things.

17:55.720 --> 17:57.438
You know, ruminate.

17:57.600 --> 17:59.352
You go ahead.
A lot of stuff on your mind.

17:59.520 --> 18:00.748
You think things out. Think.

18:00.920 --> 18:04.230
Mull, just mull. Do a lot of mulling.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.748
I gotta go find this kid.

18:06.920 --> 18:09.388
All you gotta do is lay here
and pretend you're asleep...

18:09.560 --> 18:11.357
...in case she gets back.
Here, the covers.

18:11.520 --> 18:13.750
Why don't you just cut the pants
and get them off.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.480
-I'm breaking them in.
-What am I gonna do in here?

18:16.640 --> 18:19.234
Just keep the lights out
and your eyes closed. I'll be back.

18:21.880 --> 18:23.836
Jerry, Jerry!

18:24.320 --> 18:26.959
Jerry, Jerry, the most
unbelievable thing has happened.

18:27.120 --> 18:28.269
It is so unbelievable!

18:28.440 --> 18:30.749
I'm sitting in the coffee shop,
I'm talking to Susan...

18:30.920 --> 18:32.638
...we're talking
about shoelaces...right?

18:32.800 --> 18:36.713
So in walks David, right?
He walks right up to the table, right?

18:36.880 --> 18:39.519
I introduce him to Susan,
and he says-- Now, get this.

18:39.680 --> 18:42.240
He says, "Boy, you could do
a lot better than this guy."

18:42.920 --> 18:45.036
He said the exact same thing
that I said to him...

18:45.200 --> 18:46.394
...just to get back at me.

18:46.560 --> 18:51.270
And then she says she wants
to be alone for a while. Alone, Jerry.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.876
I think that she thinks
that she could do better.

18:55.040 --> 18:56.473
Do you appreciate this?

18:56.640 --> 18:57.914
You see the irony of this?

18:58.080 --> 18:59.593
You see what's going on here?

19:00.120 --> 19:01.269
What's the matter?

19:01.440 --> 19:03.271
I'm nauseous.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.032
That what's hurting
your appreciation?

19:05.200 --> 19:06.269
A little.

19:06.440 --> 19:07.953
It's a good story,
don't you think?

19:08.120 --> 19:09.109
-It's not bad.
-Yeah.

19:17.280 --> 19:19.510
Joey, there you are. Hey, Joey!

19:19.680 --> 19:21.272
It's a monster!

19:21.440 --> 19:23.510
I'm the babysitter.

19:34.240 --> 19:35.878
Good night, honey.

19:36.360 --> 19:37.873
Good night.

19:45.280 --> 19:47.748
It's gotta have
something to do with Kramer.

19:55.600 --> 19:56.794
Elaine...

19:57.880 --> 19:59.438
...here's to you being there.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.272
And here.

20:02.400 --> 20:03.992
Excuse me.

20:08.320 --> 20:09.912
-Beth.
-David.

20:18.280 --> 20:19.679
I'll tell you, it's not bad.

20:39.520 --> 20:40.919
-George?
-Yeah?

20:41.080 --> 20:44.311
-Can I talk to you for a minute?
-Yeah, sure, sure.

20:46.160 --> 20:48.799
I've been doing a lot of thinking
about the wedding and all...

20:54.360 --> 20:57.272
...and I've decided
to go with the chicken.

21:12.320 --> 21:16.199
So chasing little kids, huh?
You're in a lot of trouble, mister.

21:16.400 --> 21:18.868
-No, look, I was babysitting--
-Yeah, yeah, all right.

21:19.040 --> 21:20.598
Sit down.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.750
What are you, deaf?
I said, sit down.

21:32.400 --> 21:37.713
-Hey, for the last time, sit down.
-Oh, yeah.
