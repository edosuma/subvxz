WEBVTT

00:06.005 --> 00:09.968
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

00:11.845 --> 00:14.264
This way, madam.

00:15.432 --> 00:16.266
Oh, my.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.939
Yumeko Jabami? Why?

00:24.816 --> 00:26.735
No, I need to concentrate.

00:26.818 --> 00:30.363
Oh, my. Don't look so upset.

00:30.447 --> 00:34.117
Let's enjoy our gambling.

00:34.701 --> 00:35.577
Damn it.

00:35.660 --> 00:40.457
All have to do is guess the right numbers.
Skill has nothing to do with it.

00:40.874 --> 00:43.251
Why are the results
so tilted in her favor?

00:43.334 --> 00:46.921
If I'm not on one hell of an unlucky
streak, the only possibility is...

00:47.005 --> 00:48.006
she's cheating.

00:48.923 --> 00:54.095
I don't know how, but she's probably
slowly setting something up.

00:54.679 --> 00:55.597
Which means...

00:57.057 --> 00:59.684
Thirty-two chips.
I'm betting my whole stack!

00:59.768 --> 01:02.604
Oh, my. Going on the offensive, huh?

01:02.687 --> 01:03.772
Very well.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.150
Both players are ready.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.111
Ten swords. Beginning.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.532
Lay your bets!

01:14.949 --> 01:17.202
Ten, nine, eight...

01:17.285 --> 01:24.000
- She fell for it. All I have to do...
- ...seven, six, five, four, three, two...

01:25.877 --> 01:26.753
I see.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.549
I've bet on five spots, six chips apiece.

01:31.633 --> 01:34.761
I'll end the game
so she won't have a chance to cheat.

01:34.844 --> 01:37.806
Time's up. Bets are laid.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.808
Here we go.

01:39.891 --> 01:44.938
Two, four, eight, 16, 22.
I just need one, please.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.523
Revealing the board.

01:47.899 --> 01:49.192
22

01:49.943 --> 01:52.195
Twenty-two. Mary got it right!

01:52.779 --> 01:56.407
Oh, my. You picked the right spot.

01:56.866 --> 01:57.700
But...

01:58.785 --> 02:00.286
the judgment is death.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.125
Too bad.

02:05.708 --> 02:09.003
What? The judgment? Didn't Mary win?

02:09.462 --> 02:13.383
Twenty-two. Since the blade is embedded
in the board, the judgment is death.

02:13.466 --> 02:16.177
Saotome bet six chips.
She loses 30 times that.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.721
One hundred eighty chips,
or 18 million yen.

02:19.305 --> 02:25.186
Adding in Yuriko's chips, she loses
with a total of minus 49.6 million chips.

02:25.270 --> 02:27.438
Good game, Mary.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.192
I'll tell you later
how I intend to collect.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.112
Someone take her outside.

02:35.446 --> 02:38.116
I'm done with her.

02:41.077 --> 02:45.582
- You're bothering the other customers.
- Don't touch me!

02:51.004 --> 02:53.715
I could've paid the money if I wanted to.

02:54.382 --> 02:57.886
But I couldn't get
the position I lost back.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.264
I never should've played this game.

03:01.931 --> 03:05.727
I should've never dreamed
of taking back my old position.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.480
No, more than that,

03:10.064 --> 03:15.945
it was a mistake to ever get involved
with Yumeko Jabami.

04:54.043 --> 04:58.881
Mary was in bad enough shape
that she challenged her to a formal match?

04:58.965 --> 05:01.592
Ryota, what's a formal match?

05:02.510 --> 05:03.344
Right.

05:03.428 --> 05:07.307
A formal match
is the one right given to a house pet.

05:08.057 --> 05:11.561
A pet has the right to challenge
anyone to a match once.

05:12.145 --> 05:16.190
If the betting amount is reasonable,
you're not allowed to refuse.

05:16.274 --> 05:19.360
It's traditional for members
of the student council to accept them

05:19.444 --> 05:21.571
with no upper betting limit.

05:22.155 --> 05:27.368
Sometimes, the house pets
will challenge them for one big game.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.454
And Mary just did that?

05:29.537 --> 05:31.080
That's right.

05:31.164 --> 05:31.998
SLIT-EYED WOMAN

05:32.081 --> 05:34.250
Yumeko Jabami, right?

05:34.334 --> 05:37.086
Welcome
to the Traditional Culture Research Club.

05:37.795 --> 05:43.176
I'm a member of the student council,
as well as the president of the club.

05:43.760 --> 05:46.471
My name is Yuriko Nishinotoin.

05:46.554 --> 05:47.847
Hello.

05:48.306 --> 05:52.310
What brings you here?
I guess I don't need to ask, do I?

05:52.894 --> 05:55.146
Why not play a game with me?

05:56.022 --> 06:00.610
It's an original gambling game
my club came up with, Life or Death.

06:00.693 --> 06:04.113
That sounds like lots of fun! I'd love to.

06:08.326 --> 06:09.786
Life or Death.

06:09.869 --> 06:14.290
First, ten small sword pieces
are put into a pot.

06:15.124 --> 06:18.961
There are 30 spots on the board
with numbers.

06:19.045 --> 06:22.548
You bet your chips
where you think the swords will fall.

06:22.632 --> 06:26.010
It's very similar to roulette
or Japanese Cho-Han gambling.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.054
You try to guess the right number.

06:28.638 --> 06:33.434
But what makes Life or Death interesting
is that if the sword comes up blade-first,

06:33.518 --> 06:36.896
it's life,
and the return is multiplied by 30.

06:37.396 --> 06:41.901
If it lands hilt-first, it's death,
and the result is minus 30.

06:41.984 --> 06:45.321
In other words, you pay your opponent
30 times the amount.

06:46.030 --> 06:48.116
There are rules for betting.

06:48.199 --> 06:52.829
Each round both players decide
how many chips they're going to bet.

06:53.663 --> 06:58.501
The judge shakes the pot for ten seconds.
Meanwhile, you put chips on the board.

06:59.127 --> 07:02.588
And when one person runs out of chips,

07:02.672 --> 07:05.591
the difference between both sides
becomes the amount won.

07:06.926 --> 07:12.056
Let's decide on the amount to bet.
It would be boring to bet too little.

07:13.057 --> 07:15.476
Okay, let's do 40 million yen.

07:16.686 --> 07:17.854
Very well.

07:18.813 --> 07:22.358
So, Yumeko, what chips shall we bet first?

07:22.442 --> 07:28.239
Let's see. I guess I'll start
by getting a feel for it. Ten chips.

07:28.823 --> 07:29.991
Very well.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.492
Both players are ready.

07:32.076 --> 07:34.287
Ten swords. Beginning.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.249
Lay your bets!

07:38.833 --> 07:42.670
Ten, nine, eight, seven...

07:42.753 --> 07:43.921
13

07:44.005 --> 07:48.801
- ...six, five, four, three, two...
- I've decided.

07:48.885 --> 07:50.094
...one, zero.

07:50.178 --> 07:51.012
Time's up.

07:51.596 --> 07:53.264
Bets are laid.

07:54.765 --> 07:57.643
You seemed to be thinking
until the last second.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.437
Do you have some plan?

08:00.021 --> 08:03.608
Yes. That pot is slightly wider
at the top than the bottom.

08:04.192 --> 08:09.780
It's more likely that the swords will land
on the small numbers in the center.

08:10.323 --> 08:14.494
Whether I get life or death, if I don't
get the number right, it's boring.

08:15.077 --> 08:18.164
I'm not a very patient girl.

08:20.041 --> 08:23.669
I pray that does not come back
to haunt you.

08:24.253 --> 08:26.672
Here we go. Revealing the board.

08:27.256 --> 08:28.174
Seventeen, life.

08:28.257 --> 08:29.550
Thirty, death.

08:31.135 --> 08:33.638
Yumeko didn't get one right.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.639
Nishinotoin got...

08:35.848 --> 08:38.893
That was close. She was one off.

08:38.976 --> 08:41.771
Every chip on life is 30 million yen.

08:41.854 --> 08:45.066
Since both players won nothing,
no chips will change hands.

08:45.149 --> 08:48.402
How close.
Let's move on to the next round.

08:48.486 --> 08:53.157
Yumeko, I can't watch this. You can't
gamble with this stupid amount of money.

08:53.241 --> 08:57.203
Ryota, you don't need to worry.

08:57.870 --> 09:01.040
This tiny amount of money
is meaningless to me.

09:01.624 --> 09:06.087
And the speed at which chips change hands
is what makes this game interesting.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.965
It would be a waste to stop now.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.968
- Ryota, was it?
- Yes.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.262
The feeling
of unimaginable amounts of money

09:14.345 --> 09:17.139
moving around
with a single shake of a pot...

09:17.974 --> 09:22.478
If you tasted it once, you'd understand.
Right, Yumeko?

09:23.062 --> 09:26.190
Yes. I can see myself getting addicted.

09:26.983 --> 09:29.068
But, Nishinotoin,

09:30.653 --> 09:32.655
the way you're playing is terrible.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.493
I'm sorry, what was that?

09:37.577 --> 09:42.206
Did you not hear me?
I said you're terrible.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.459
That official match with Mary...

09:45.543 --> 09:48.588
You're the one
who suggested this game, right?

09:49.422 --> 09:55.386
I think Mary challenged you to restore
her honor, but if that's all she wanted,

09:55.469 --> 09:59.765
she didn't need to play a game
with such huge potential losses.

10:00.474 --> 10:04.895
Giving someone in a bad spot hope,
then sending them into deeper despair...

10:05.479 --> 10:07.898
It's the same as being sleazy loan broker.

10:07.982 --> 10:13.904
I don't know how good a gambler you are,
but you're the worst kind of human being.

10:17.825 --> 10:22.496
- You're a piece of shit, aren't you?
- How rude! Yuriko, let's kick her out!

10:28.336 --> 10:31.505
What's wrong, Kumagusu?

10:35.217 --> 10:37.303
We're just bantering a little.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.807
- Of course.
- It's a shame, though.

10:41.891 --> 10:47.438
I was sure I'd see two, four, and ten.
But it didn't work that way.

10:48.022 --> 10:49.732
Two, four, ten?

10:49.815 --> 10:53.110
I love word games.

10:53.194 --> 10:58.824
In Japanese,
the name Nishinotoin can be read "2410in."

10:58.908 --> 11:01.619
Are you not superstitious?

11:02.787 --> 11:06.082
Would you not play games with my name?

11:06.832 --> 11:10.795
Nishinotoin is a name stretching back
to the earliest days of Japan.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.089
If you count them as even numbers,

11:13.172 --> 11:16.050
the six and eight in the middle
are missing.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.927
There's an empty space between them.

11:18.928 --> 11:23.224
An empty space just like the empty space
in your head. That's hilarious!

11:23.307 --> 11:25.101
Right, Ryota?

11:25.184 --> 11:27.478
Would you knock it off?

11:32.483 --> 11:33.526
Interesting.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.570
Just like
what the student council president said,

11:36.654 --> 11:38.364
you really are interesting.

11:39.573 --> 11:42.868
When you compliment me,
it makes me feel all tingly.

11:50.501 --> 11:54.088
Let's continue. How much will you bet?

11:56.257 --> 11:58.676
All I have left. 40 chips.

11:59.844 --> 12:03.889
You've got quite a bit of resolve, huh?
Kumagusu?

12:04.557 --> 12:06.517
Both players are ready.

12:07.184 --> 12:09.395
Ten swords. Beginning!

12:21.449 --> 12:23.784
Lay your bets! Ten...

12:24.368 --> 12:29.039
It wouldn't be good for my mental state
to just win normally, would it?

12:30.166 --> 12:32.251
Stress is the enemy of beauty.

12:34.420 --> 12:38.549
Life or death. I'll kill you, literally.

12:43.471 --> 12:44.680
Five chips on eight spots.

12:44.763 --> 12:48.392
If she wanted to take Yumeko down,
there'd be no need to bet all five.

12:48.976 --> 12:52.688
She's definitely crazy.
I knew provoking her was a mistake.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.774
...two, one, zer--

12:57.526 --> 13:02.323
Nishinotoin, if you were offended
by what I said, I apologize.

13:03.032 --> 13:06.702
It was all lies I told
to bring us to this point.

13:06.785 --> 13:07.786
24

13:07.870 --> 13:09.330
Please forgive me.

13:11.373 --> 13:15.836
- Why?
- Why? Because you're cheating.

13:18.714 --> 13:19.798
Cheating?

13:19.882 --> 13:23.302
Yes. Look at the judge's right hand.

13:23.886 --> 13:26.430
You see what looks like moles, right?

13:26.514 --> 13:27.765
That's right.

13:28.224 --> 13:32.311
I saw the same thing on the girl
who brought us in here.

13:33.020 --> 13:36.649
- What does that mean?
- Those moles are artificial.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.400
Piercings, I'm sure.

13:39.109 --> 13:43.614
You're piercing your club members' hands
just for the sake of this trick.

13:44.365 --> 13:49.203
Nishinotoin, that's really wonderful.

13:49.954 --> 13:53.457
I imagine every single sword
has a magnet in it.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.503
If you put a magnetic field
on the piercings,

13:57.586 --> 14:00.005
you can fix the sword in a certain spot.

14:00.798 --> 14:05.010
Then you just slide your hand
along the pot like this,

14:05.678 --> 14:09.848
and you can send the sword
wherever you like.

14:09.932 --> 14:15.062
Wait. You're telling me you provoked her
to make sure she cheated this round?

14:15.145 --> 14:16.480
Wait.

14:17.314 --> 14:21.402
I haven't gotten a single spot right
since you came here.

14:21.986 --> 14:26.198
Your friend only bet in the last game
while the pot was being shaken.

14:26.365 --> 14:29.493
There's no way I could've cheated!

14:30.452 --> 14:32.913
What makes this cheat so wonderful

14:32.997 --> 14:36.083
is that you can't win
100 percent of the time.

14:36.166 --> 14:41.422
It takes a lot of control for the judge
to send the sword to the right spot.

14:42.006 --> 14:45.050
Another sword might block it.

14:45.134 --> 14:49.179
Since you can only control one sword,
the others are left to luck.

14:49.763 --> 14:53.517
I'd imagine your actual win ratio
isn't that high, is it?

14:53.601 --> 14:58.898
That's why Mary couldn't catch you.
The cheating isn't a sure thing.

14:59.815 --> 15:02.109
But that was enough for you.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.237
You're the president
of the Traditional Culture Research Club

15:05.321 --> 15:07.197
and a member of the student council.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.409
You've got plenty of money when you play.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.872
You don't need to win every match.

15:14.955 --> 15:17.958
You just need to win a little more
than your opponents.

15:18.042 --> 15:24.632
Over the course of hundreds of games,
you can win stable earnings.

15:25.215 --> 15:29.094
The core of this trick isn't the trick
itself, it's how much money you have.

15:30.262 --> 15:35.059
A few million yen is nothing to you.

15:35.643 --> 15:39.021
But that's not a fair game.

15:39.104 --> 15:42.524
I'm betting my entire fortune.
It's not fair.

15:45.527 --> 15:47.321
Let's feel the same pain.

15:48.280 --> 15:50.616
My bet is 40 chips.

15:50.699 --> 15:54.662
If I get the life, your loss will be

15:55.245 --> 15:57.790
2.17 billion yen.

16:01.293 --> 16:04.755
You may lose all that in a single round.

16:05.339 --> 16:08.008
It's truly life or death, isn't it?

16:08.092 --> 16:11.720
Come on.

16:17.685 --> 16:19.603
Let's get our gamble freak on!

16:26.986 --> 16:29.196
Come on, let's finish it!

16:30.406 --> 16:31.782
Open the pot!

16:33.367 --> 16:34.785
Nishinotoin!

16:35.369 --> 16:41.792
If I lose, I lose 2.17 billion yen.
I can't afford to lose that much money.

16:41.875 --> 16:45.170
I'd have to take all the funds
in the club's pool.

16:45.254 --> 16:49.466
But if I can't maintain that,
I lose my seat on the student council.

16:49.550 --> 16:53.220
The club can only exist
because I'm on the council.

16:53.303 --> 16:56.348
That's how I keep the girls
from being house pets.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.976
If I lose that, I lose everything.

16:59.810 --> 17:05.482
I'm ruined. I have to talk her down.
If I do it before she opens the pot...

17:06.066 --> 17:07.985
Yumeko.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.243
Excuse me.

17:16.326 --> 17:18.662
President? Why?

17:18.746 --> 17:21.957
This looks fun.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.337
It looks like you're betting a lot.

17:27.421 --> 17:32.384
At times like this, trouble is likely
to occur. I'll be an observer.

17:32.468 --> 17:37.389
There's no need for you to.
I can handle this myself.

17:39.308 --> 17:41.477
Just shut up and play.

17:43.103 --> 17:45.439
You're dead pale, Yuriko. Are you okay?

17:46.023 --> 17:46.857
Nishinotoin.

17:51.945 --> 17:54.323
Here we go. Revealing the board.

17:58.952 --> 18:01.038
Death on ten and life on seven!

18:01.121 --> 18:04.750
Seven. I just bet there randomly.

18:05.626 --> 18:10.214
No, more importantly,
it didn't land on 24?

18:10.297 --> 18:15.928
Nishinotoin bet five chips on life,
so she has 195 chips in total.

18:16.011 --> 18:18.305
Jabami has minus 115 chips.

18:18.388 --> 18:22.392
Yuriko wins with 310 million yen.

18:23.519 --> 18:26.396
Impossible. Yumeko lost?

18:28.565 --> 18:31.860
I didn't think you'd actually win.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.864
Yuriko, you've got some good luck.
I'm impressed.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.618
But, you, I'm disappointed in you.

18:40.452 --> 18:44.248
You tried so hard
and lost to a lucky punch.

18:44.832 --> 18:48.752
Was it a badger? You got me there.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.756
I couldn't say.

19:03.308 --> 19:08.605
A badger was a trick once used
in Japanese Cho-Han gambling.

19:09.231 --> 19:13.819
First, you put a small hole in the floor.

19:13.902 --> 19:16.029
The gambling's done on top of it.

19:16.113 --> 19:18.782
Since a white cloth is put down,
it's hard to see.

19:19.491 --> 19:22.452
Japanese houses have space
under the floors, right?

19:23.036 --> 19:25.372
The cheater hides under the floorboards.

19:25.914 --> 19:27.708
He uses candlelight or something else

19:27.791 --> 19:30.836
to see through the floor
and look at the dice.

19:31.420 --> 19:35.048
And depending on what they are,
pokes at them with a needle,

19:35.132 --> 19:38.218
changing them to something
that benefits the house.

19:38.969 --> 19:43.724
I bet the student council president used
magnets to make someone do the same thing.

19:44.641 --> 19:49.104
She used the magnets
to knock the sword out of spot 24.

19:49.688 --> 19:54.860
From the look on Nishinotoin's face,
she wasn't told.

19:55.444 --> 19:59.781
It was coincidence,
pure luck, that she won.

19:59.865 --> 20:04.369
But you can only do that if you have space
under the floor, like a Japanese building.

20:04.453 --> 20:10.792
You can just make a space above the room.
You just build the room to accommodate it.

20:10.876 --> 20:16.089
No, perhaps the president put it in
just for that game.

20:16.173 --> 20:17.257
Don't tell me...

20:19.051 --> 20:21.178
How wonderful that would be.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.598
Normally, you wouldn't think of that.

20:24.681 --> 20:30.354
Even if you did, you wouldn't actually
do it. Only a madwoman would.

20:31.104 --> 20:33.732
This academy, no,
the student council president,

20:33.815 --> 20:35.692
is beyond what I imagined.

20:37.527 --> 20:38.362
I've decided.

20:39.905 --> 20:42.950
I want to gamble
with the student council president.

20:52.459 --> 20:54.711
Mittens!

20:54.795 --> 20:56.463
BOTTOM-FEEDER 0001 MITTENS

20:57.881 --> 20:58.882
Jabami.

20:59.549 --> 21:03.345
I heard you gambled
with the student council yesterday.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.931
Yes, but I lost.

21:06.014 --> 21:07.849
Yeah, I heard that too.

21:07.933 --> 21:10.769
And so, we...

21:10.852 --> 21:13.146
Oh, you're all worried--

21:14.690 --> 21:18.568
What are you talking about, house pet?
We're here to laugh at you!

21:18.652 --> 21:21.488
Nobody's worried about you, Mittens.

21:21.571 --> 21:24.366
Your loser cat genes might rub off on us.

21:24.908 --> 21:27.953
I see. So, female house pets are Mittens.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.788
Loser cats.

21:30.372 --> 21:32.541
Cats are cute, though, right?

21:34.668 --> 21:39.298
Meow, meow. I'm a losing cat
with a gambling addiction.

21:39.881 --> 21:44.386
I lost to the student council,
and now I have 300 million yen in debt.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.140
How should I get it back, huh?

21:48.890 --> 21:52.227
I want to gamble more.

21:52.811 --> 21:55.939
Would anybody like to be my patron?

21:56.023 --> 21:57.733
What's with her?

21:57.816 --> 22:00.402
- She's crazy.
- Let's go.

22:00.944 --> 22:02.446
Yumeko.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.448
What are you doing?

22:05.615 --> 22:08.118
They've got no sense of humor, huh?

22:08.201 --> 22:10.829
- Right, Ryota?
- I get it.

22:10.912 --> 22:14.082
I could get into this.

22:14.166 --> 22:17.836
- Should I wear a tail?
- Stop it.

22:19.629 --> 22:21.298
Good morning, everyone.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.176
Morning.

22:24.760 --> 22:26.553
Yuriko's not here, is she?

22:26.636 --> 22:30.599
She couldn't show up after that failure.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.477
But she won, though.

22:34.770 --> 22:36.146
Good morning, Sayaka.

22:36.229 --> 22:37.939
Good morning, Student Council President.

22:38.023 --> 22:42.778
These are the plans for Yumeko Jabami
and Mary Saotome.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.323
LIFE PLANS - YUMEKO

24:19.499 --> 24:21.710
- We call it the Debt Swap Game.
- Shut up!

24:21.793 --> 24:24.963
- I heard you're Mittens now.
- The only choice here is to shoot!

24:25.046 --> 24:26.381
Call. One Tsubomi chip.

24:26.464 --> 24:28.675
This feeling, it's wonderful.

24:28.758 --> 24:30.969
