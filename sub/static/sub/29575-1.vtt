02:58.245 --> 03:05.684
(Groaning)

03:06.253 --> 03:13.892
(Groaning)

03:14.962 --> 03:18.764
This is heavier than
the stone hedge we found in..

03:18.766 --> 03:20.933
..Annawood Tooty, professor.

03:23.437 --> 03:25.470
Bend at the knees, old friend.

03:25.472 --> 03:27.372
I have confidence in you.

03:28.976 --> 03:31.476
Now this is interesting.

03:34.715 --> 03:37.416
It's a maze. A pattern.

03:37.618 --> 03:38.917
A puzzle.

03:52.866 --> 03:55.467
Amazing technology.

03:56.003 --> 03:57.536
Careful professor.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.905
You know these temples
are booby traps.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.874
Professor!

04:08.616 --> 04:11.350
Really Willard.
You must be more careful.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.919
These things are thousands
of years old, you know.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.654
Of course, professor.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.724
The ancients were remarkable.

04:18.726 --> 04:20.259
Here, check this out.

04:20.394 --> 04:23.428
This tablet confirms my
theory about the existence..

04:23.430 --> 04:26.732
..of fantastical creatures
in a hidden land.

04:26.734 --> 04:29.768
Always with the hidden lands,
isn't Willard?

04:29.770 --> 04:33.538
Yes, a land of unicorns,
rocs, Minotaur.

04:33.540 --> 04:34.773
The whole bunch.

04:36.844 --> 04:39.011
My kids will love this.

04:40.314 --> 04:42.948
Primitive Sanskrit in Bolivia.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.883
That's something I love.

04:45.386 --> 04:47.686
True character leads the ways.

04:47.688 --> 04:50.455
Sleeping sentinel. Leap of
faith.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.957
The dream world.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.926
No unicorns, Willard.

04:55.763 --> 04:58.563
If you really want to
show your children a unicorn..

04:58.565 --> 05:01.867
..I can extract its DNA
from the global gene pool.

05:01.869 --> 05:03.568
I got my notes right here.

05:03.570 --> 05:07.005
No, I don't want to make it,
Shonku.
I want to find it.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.907
Professor Shonku.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.677
Franjotti!

05:13.314 --> 05:16.014
You have lost weight.
Are you feeling well?

05:16.350 --> 05:20.052
My old friend. I heard a
crashing.

05:20.054 --> 05:24.356
But it had to be you. Hello
Willard.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.358
You know how this works.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.727
You two go out and then find
things..

05:28.729 --> 05:33.332
..and get all dusty and dirty.
And full of mummy cooties.

05:33.334 --> 05:37.369
And then I take those things
from you.

05:37.571 --> 05:40.105
Easy. Peasy. Squeezy Huh?

05:40.507 --> 05:44.443
Well my friends, Luigi and
Thomasina..

05:44.445 --> 05:46.812
..will show you what happens
next.

05:46.814 --> 05:48.747
Love to Mr. Franzotti.

05:48.749 --> 05:51.383
Nothing would make us happier.

05:57.391 --> 06:01.126
1600. No 1700 feet to the
bottom.

06:01.128 --> 06:03.061
You won't survive the fall.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.629
We will have to escape.

06:04.631 --> 06:06.365
Good to go, Mr. Franzotti sir.

06:06.367 --> 06:08.433
You can't rob the temple,
Franzotti.

06:08.435 --> 06:10.702
These artifacts are priceless.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.872
They have their price, all
right.

06:13.874 --> 06:18.377
Someone like reading before bed
time,
Mr. Franzotti.

06:19.146 --> 06:25.150
But this.
The diary of Prof. Shonku is
priceless.

06:25.152 --> 06:28.620
Compared to your research
the notebooks of Da Vinci..

06:28.622 --> 06:30.756
..are petrified back guano.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.124
(Sighing)

06:32.126 --> 06:34.760
Your inventions in
the first few pages alone..

06:34.762 --> 06:38.430
..will make me a very wealthy
man.

06:38.432 --> 06:39.798
(Laughing)

06:39.800 --> 06:41.933
And that's a lot of wealth.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.136
Sorry, I can't hang around.

06:44.138 --> 06:48.840
I have got a date with the
twins.
Fame and Fortune.

06:48.842 --> 06:49.875
Yes.

06:50.444 --> 06:52.811
(Laughing)

06:55.048 --> 06:57.649
(Laughing) Clumsy little me.

07:00.187 --> 07:02.954
Stalactites. Great news.

07:03.757 --> 07:07.526
Shonku, focus.
The temple is crumbling.

07:07.528 --> 07:10.896
These deposits of calcium
carbonate
shall save us.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.130
Swing.

07:14.601 --> 07:15.634
(Groaning)

07:17.037 --> 07:18.570
What are you doing?

07:18.705 --> 07:21.873
Geometry. Timing is everything.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.409
(Groaning)

07:24.410 --> 07:26.944
Scream like you have seen a
bunch.
- With pleasure.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.147
(Screaming)

07:31.685 --> 07:33.618
(Screaming)

07:34.755 --> 07:36.955
How fast can you run, old
friend?

07:37.891 --> 07:39.458
I will race you.

07:43.564 --> 07:46.097
We made it. Willard!

07:46.099 --> 07:49.734
(Panting)

07:50.237 --> 07:52.571
At least I saved the tablet.

07:56.844 --> 07:59.077
Time for a ride, old friend.

08:06.820 --> 08:09.921
I do so love the beauty of
stolen art.

08:10.724 --> 08:14.092
It is so beautifully free. Yeah?

08:22.269 --> 08:25.770
Shonku. That's what I like about
you.

08:25.772 --> 08:27.672
You keep fighting.

08:27.975 --> 08:29.808
Got it, professor.

08:30.010 --> 08:31.610
Pull and don't use your knees.

08:36.116 --> 08:39.116
Thomasina. What do I pay you
for?

08:48.195 --> 08:50.028
No!

08:50.898 --> 08:53.665
I will make a deal with you,
professor.

08:53.834 --> 08:58.603
You keep your friend
and I will keep your diary.

08:58.805 --> 09:00.071
Win-win.

09:00.240 --> 09:04.075
This is Timbuctoo all over
again.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.879
Willard.

09:09.182 --> 09:10.615
(Laughing)

09:13.787 --> 09:15.620
Hold on, Willard.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.023
Do I have a choice?

09:18.025 --> 09:18.957
(Groaning)

09:32.205 --> 09:33.905
The plane!

09:56.163 --> 09:59.064
Melody, you should check
out the food car on this train.

09:59.066 --> 10:02.667
It's... delicious.

10:03.236 --> 10:05.904
Not hungry. Thanks though.

10:06.239 --> 10:09.307
Safe and sound so far.

10:09.309 --> 10:10.909
Who you are texting?

10:12.179 --> 10:14.413
Nana Willard.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.648
You know how she worries
when we go off on our own.

10:16.650 --> 10:19.384
Even if it's just
to professor Shonku's.

10:19.853 --> 10:21.886
You think he can help us find
dad.

10:21.888 --> 10:23.355
He is dad's best friend.

10:23.357 --> 10:28.827
If anyone can help, it's him.
Nana says good luck.

10:28.829 --> 10:33.231
And to stop drinking soda.
It's bad for you.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.207
We are coming into the station
now.

10:42.909 --> 10:44.743
I better grab a refill.

11:15.909 --> 11:18.777
Okay. We are here. What's next?

11:19.079 --> 11:22.380
Somebody got to know
the way to Shonku's house.

11:22.749 --> 11:24.849
We will try to find a taxi.

11:25.752 --> 11:30.755
Shonku? Professor Shonku, did
you say?

11:30.757 --> 11:33.058
Do you know him?
- Of course.

11:33.060 --> 11:34.726
This way please.

11:34.728 --> 11:39.197
My husband has a car, little
darling.

11:39.766 --> 11:43.368
We have wireless internet,
video games..

11:43.370 --> 11:47.105
..and other things to keep
you busy during the journey.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.108
Melody! Mo! Delighted to see
you.

11:50.110 --> 11:54.079
So careful around strangers
at a train station.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.781
I am Robu, series 3.

11:56.783 --> 11:59.117
Personal Shonku's personal
assistant.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.119
He will be delighted to see you.

12:01.421 --> 12:03.421
Come along. Leap it.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.258
My transportation is right this
way.

12:11.298 --> 12:12.263
(Surprised)

12:14.868 --> 12:16.301
Shall we be off then?

12:20.240 --> 12:22.874
Professor Shonku's old
invention.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.160
Quadro diesel.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.445
Even though it is
orange its green energy.

12:27.447 --> 12:28.913
(Laughing)

12:29.249 --> 12:32.150
Buckle up. I am still learning.

12:37.124 --> 12:37.989
(Groaning)

12:47.868 --> 12:49.234
Watch out.

12:51.471 --> 12:53.471
How much further?

12:53.840 --> 12:56.775
"Who has come into my dreams?"

12:59.880 --> 13:02.413
Watch out! Over there!

13:02.816 --> 13:03.815
(Groaning)

13:06.353 --> 13:07.485
(Groaning)

13:11.792 --> 13:13.191
No!

13:18.465 --> 13:20.265
This is great!

13:21.501 --> 13:22.834
Yes.

13:27.574 --> 13:29.007
We have arrived.

13:30.510 --> 13:31.976
Wow!

13:31.978 --> 13:33.812
Do press the remote. Will you?

13:45.091 --> 13:47.926
(Screaming)

13:48.528 --> 13:49.928
Wow!

13:58.205 --> 14:00.104
It's beautiful!

14:05.612 --> 14:07.312
(Excited)

14:25.966 --> 14:27.899
Welcome to Shonku manor.

14:27.901 --> 14:30.335
Home of the great professor
Shonku.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.972
He will be delighted to meet
the children of Charles Willard.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.186
Sir, I believe I found...

14:48.188 --> 14:49.888
My new assistants?

14:49.890 --> 14:52.123
About time Robu.
Get them to the laboratory.

14:57.030 --> 14:59.931
Don't just stand there
with your mouths open.

14:59.933 --> 15:01.633
Unless you want to catch a bug.

15:02.002 --> 15:04.035
Are you trying to catch a bug?

15:11.244 --> 15:13.278
You. Boy?
- Mo.

15:14.047 --> 15:16.614
Professor, we have to talk.
- Later Mo.

15:16.616 --> 15:18.283
Here hold this.

15:18.551 --> 15:20.518
Always be prepared.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.553
You girl?
- Melody.

15:22.555 --> 15:25.456
Harmony? Melody? Cacophony?
Whatever.

15:25.992 --> 15:27.191
Hold this.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.595
Now you Jo. Hold the vial
steady..

15:30.597 --> 15:32.463
..while she draw us 10cc..

15:32.465 --> 15:35.633
But sir, professor we...
- I will do it myself.

15:35.635 --> 15:39.370
Robu, if these new assistants
are going to work out..

15:39.372 --> 15:41.606
..they will have to learn my
system.

15:56.489 --> 16:01.292
It's a thing,
with a thing on its thing.

16:01.561 --> 16:04.662
It's a unicorn.

16:05.198 --> 16:08.032
I told Willard that I could do
it.

16:08.034 --> 16:10.668
No need for a quest around the
world.

16:11.237 --> 16:14.272
It.. It is beautiful.

16:14.274 --> 16:19.077
Really? Maybe on planet
Frankenvon-creasturestine.

16:19.079 --> 16:23.114
Young man.
That is a living breathing
unicorn.

16:23.116 --> 16:26.150
Extracted from the
universal gene pool..

16:26.152 --> 16:28.419
..using just my memory.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.155
Since my notebooks seemed to
have...

16:31.491 --> 16:35.326
Well, the less said
about that the better I say.

16:40.100 --> 16:42.633
Newton! Show some manners.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.370
Obviously cat manners are
different.

16:45.638 --> 16:47.305
Exactly, sir.

16:49.676 --> 16:53.277
Professor,
we are not your new lab
assistants.

16:53.513 --> 16:57.015
We have to talk to you.
- Professor Shonku.

16:57.017 --> 17:00.551
It is I, Avi.
Your neighbour from next door.

17:00.553 --> 17:03.755
Such a crop of mangoes
I am delivering.

17:03.757 --> 17:05.607
Hi.

17:05.608 --> 17:07.458
Fresh from my hydro farming
garden.

17:07.660 --> 17:09.260
(Groaning)

17:09.695 --> 17:13.598
It's a mini horse. It's a baby
rhinoceros.

17:20.272 --> 17:24.541
Oh no! Mangoes bruise easily.

17:26.112 --> 17:28.346
Just look at it, Robu.

17:28.348 --> 17:32.050
It's amazing. Willard would love
it.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.652
Science gives us all pleasure,
sir.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.122
Shall I get the vacuum?

17:38.124 --> 17:42.527
Sir, Professor Shonku.
- May we have a word please?

17:42.529 --> 17:44.195
It's about our father.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.763
Wait a minute.

17:45.765 --> 17:49.167
Mo! Harmony!
- Melody.

17:49.169 --> 17:52.270
Of course, you are Willard's
children.

17:52.272 --> 17:56.240
Wonderful!
Robu! Why didn't you tell me?

17:56.242 --> 17:57.842
Well sir. There was...

17:57.844 --> 18:01.245
I had lemonade prepared
and we can sit on the deck..

18:01.247 --> 18:05.183
..and you can tell me
all about my dear, dear friend.

18:05.318 --> 18:08.286
What's he even up to?
- He is missing.

18:09.155 --> 18:11.155
That's why we came to find you.

18:23.803 --> 18:27.338
Professor Shonku! Pardon me.

18:27.674 --> 18:30.374
Where should I put the mangoes?

18:31.511 --> 18:35.113
I am on the verge of
something truly amazing.

18:35.115 --> 18:38.416
Proof! Living breathing proof of
life.

18:38.551 --> 18:41.719
Professor Shonku have
to see it with his own eyes.

18:41.721 --> 18:44.489
It's absolutely outstanding.

18:44.491 --> 18:45.456
(Screaming)

18:47.894 --> 18:51.295
So what do you think?
He's okay. Right?

18:51.764 --> 18:54.699
Our dad said to find you
if there was ever trouble.

18:56.603 --> 18:57.702
Professor.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.342
Yes, body guard.

19:04.344 --> 19:06.711
Fire up the jet and
clear up the runway.

19:07.347 --> 19:10.348
Don't just stand there
with your mouths hanging open?

19:10.350 --> 19:13.885
Bounce! Remember.
We have got to find your father?

19:22.729 --> 19:24.462
Melody! Mo!

19:24.931 --> 19:26.564
Professor Shonku!

19:27.333 --> 19:29.200
Professor Shonku!

19:46.653 --> 19:48.920
Greetings, professor.
- Body guard.

19:48.922 --> 19:51.489
All is in readiness and beyond.

19:53.660 --> 19:57.328
Alukot! Don't forget
to feed my unicorn.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.050
Wait sis.

20:02.051 --> 20:03.768
We are getting on a plane
with a crazy old rich bloke..

20:03.770 --> 20:06.537
..who makes unicorns
in his spare time.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.839
Is that a good idea?

20:09.442 --> 20:12.243
To find dad I would
rather laser shock through..

20:12.245 --> 20:14.478
..a school of hungry zombie
piranhas.

20:14.480 --> 20:18.716
Okay, but if there is a laser
shock,
you go first.

20:36.369 --> 20:41.539
Robu, cut across to the airfield
nearest to Willard's last
communication.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.007
Yes.

20:43.343 --> 20:46.444
Almora. We are off to Almora.

20:46.646 --> 20:48.613
Let's see what's waiting for us.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.314
Excuse me.

20:50.950 --> 20:52.383
Avi?

20:53.386 --> 20:57.288
You never said where
you wanted the mangoes.

20:57.290 --> 21:00.258
Obviously I want them in Almora.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.028
Almora.

21:04.397 --> 21:06.430
Do you see them yet, Robu?

21:08.534 --> 21:11.669
Right behind us.
I didn't expect them so soon.

21:11.671 --> 21:12.803
Who's behind us?

21:12.805 --> 21:15.373
We have been followed.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.942
I have a business rival
who likes to know what I am up
to.

21:20.413 --> 21:22.613
There is a storm
coming up from the west.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.548
Head into it.

21:24.717 --> 21:27.718
This is my favourite part. The
chase.

21:32.792 --> 21:37.395
(Lightning)

21:37.397 --> 21:39.630
They are not following
us into the storm.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.333
Franzotti must not
be paying them enough.

21:49.842 --> 21:52.043
Are you ready, my darling?

21:52.045 --> 21:53.678
(Lightning)

21:53.680 --> 21:57.915
The track is all set.
And stop calling me darling.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.024
Sorry.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.931
Luigi!

22:15.401 --> 22:17.535
Next time I am the pilot.

22:17.737 --> 22:19.870
Okay, okay. Sorry, my love.

22:19.872 --> 22:24.809
If it's any consolation,
Mr. Franzotti says job well
done.

22:26.079 --> 22:29.613
I am not your love. (Angry)

22:34.554 --> 22:36.120
(Groaning)

22:39.525 --> 22:42.760
Robu! Emergency battery power.

22:48.901 --> 22:50.634
Everybody paddle.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.637
This is your emergency power
supply?

22:53.639 --> 22:55.506
At least it is green.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.808
I am going to need a mango.

23:21.134 --> 23:25.002
Robu! You have done it again.
Excellent job.

23:25.538 --> 23:28.139
One of our better landings,
I do believe.

23:29.976 --> 23:32.710
I take my mangoes aboard.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.583
Refuel us and check out the
engines.

23:39.585 --> 23:42.019
Will you, Robu?
- Yes.

23:44.991 --> 23:47.858
Harmony.
- Melody.

23:48.161 --> 23:50.461
You and Mo stay here with Avi.

23:50.463 --> 23:52.496
I have got business in town.

23:53.099 --> 23:54.899
Yes.
- Yes.

23:56.669 --> 23:59.603
No rush, sir. This will take a
while.

24:01.674 --> 24:05.976
Was there a body?
- No, just this professor.

24:07.680 --> 24:11.215
A group of nomads got them down
from the mountains.

24:11.617 --> 24:16.554
It seems pretty clear that
Mr. Charles Willard is dead.

24:19.692 --> 24:21.892
Did you ever meet Willard,
Captain?

24:21.894 --> 24:24.829
No, sir. I never had the chance.

24:24.831 --> 24:27.498
My friend Willard is an
archaeologist.

24:27.667 --> 24:31.469
He loves clues.
He is still alive, captain.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.537
And I will find him.

24:37.009 --> 24:39.109
Hey Melody, look at this little
guy.

24:40.646 --> 24:44.615
He acts like a clown.
- And he bites like a monkey.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.750
With really sharp teeth.

24:46.886 --> 24:49.720
You are no fun, Harmony.

24:50.122 --> 24:51.755
Ha-ha.

24:53.192 --> 24:54.959
Hey! Give that bag.

24:55.761 --> 24:58.162
That's funny. He wants to play.

24:58.698 --> 25:01.532
He doesn't wants to play.
He wants to steal.

25:03.135 --> 25:04.235
(Laughing)

25:08.708 --> 25:09.907
(Laughing)

25:14.180 --> 25:17.615
Got it! Now I am going
to post it on the internet.

25:18.050 --> 25:22.186
I am calling it,
my little brother visits Almora.

25:24.524 --> 25:26.757
It's already got 6 comments.

25:26.759 --> 25:32.763
And a 7, 8, 9. You make a viral.

25:33.266 --> 25:36.934
Who cares about that?
Help me get back my music.

25:42.875 --> 25:47.244
(Groaning)

25:49.282 --> 25:52.283
Definitely a problem
with the electrical output.

25:52.285 --> 25:54.618
Stop. Leave!

25:57.056 --> 25:58.289
Mr. Avi, sir.

25:58.291 --> 26:00.024
Yes, Robu.

26:00.192 --> 26:01.292
The children.

26:01.294 --> 26:03.060
You are supposed to be watching
them.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.895
Not watching them run away.

26:08.868 --> 26:10.100
Come on.

26:15.207 --> 26:16.774
Down here.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.146
Brilliant! We have got him now.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.182
Mo! I don't... I don't think
that's..

26:26.285 --> 26:28.586
..such a good idea.

26:31.324 --> 26:34.658
Look, its curious little
children.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.794
You know what they say.

26:37.763 --> 26:40.965
Curiosity killed the water
buffalo.

26:41.667 --> 26:44.802
Cat. Its curiosity killed the
cat.

26:45.871 --> 26:49.673
Cat, water buffalo.
Who are we to argue, really.

26:50.610 --> 26:53.277
So nice to meet you in a dark
alley.

26:53.279 --> 26:56.013
Come along, Mo. We have got to
hurry.

26:56.015 --> 26:59.350
Our parents get shooting
when they get worried, right?

27:00.686 --> 27:02.720
Yes. Yes, that's right.

27:03.723 --> 27:05.656
(Screaming)

27:07.159 --> 27:09.393
(Groaning)

27:11.631 --> 27:14.398
Look, this is all just
a big misunderstanding.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.167
Big misunderstanding.

27:17.370 --> 27:20.638
We are just looking for a
monkey.
Not trouble.

27:20.640 --> 27:21.905
Just the monkey.

27:23.743 --> 27:25.843
Melody.
- I am working on it.

27:25.845 --> 27:28.078
How much taekwondo
do you still remember?

27:28.280 --> 27:30.881
Enough to call it taekwondon't.

27:36.689 --> 27:38.188
What is going on here?

27:38.190 --> 27:42.226
A private matter. Large person.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.261
I am Markovitch.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.764
It does not concern you.

27:46.766 --> 27:48.999
That monkey stole my music.

27:50.736 --> 27:52.936
We are just trying to get it
back.

27:52.938 --> 27:56.273
If this is true,
give the boy his music back.

27:56.275 --> 28:00.778
You were warned. Cut him.
- Got it.

28:04.450 --> 28:07.184
Hey! That was my favourite hat.

28:08.287 --> 28:09.386
(Angry)

28:25.137 --> 28:28.238
My cousin Porguvitch.
He taught me to punch.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.474
I practice with ox. (Laughing)

28:40.186 --> 28:43.454
Do you know how many punches
it takes to drop an ox?

28:50.796 --> 28:52.463
He is good.

28:53.332 --> 28:54.832
Are you okay?

28:54.834 --> 28:58.268
We are fine.
Thanks. They are getting away.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.771
And stay away from my new
friends.

29:02.074 --> 29:04.775
I want to learn that move. Cool.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.053
I think he learned his lesson.

29:16.455 --> 29:17.955
Thanks Mr. Markovitch.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.189
(Laughing)

29:20.793 --> 29:23.460
Oh my! Is everyone okay?

29:23.462 --> 29:26.096
Did I miss everything terrible?

29:26.932 --> 29:30.334
Everything is great now.
- Sword.

29:45.518 --> 29:49.553
We have returned from a
successful thrashing of thugs.

29:49.922 --> 29:51.955
Hey! Dad's things.

29:52.091 --> 29:54.358
Did you find him? Is he here?

29:54.493 --> 29:56.426
No, he is here.

29:59.498 --> 30:02.533
Can you tell where he is?
- Is there a clue?

30:02.968 --> 30:04.201
There is a poem.

30:04.537 --> 30:06.870
But dad's not much of a poet.

30:06.872 --> 30:10.908
Journey forth to a
paradise where we dwell.

30:11.510 --> 30:16.180
True character leads the way
at the whim of the sun.

30:16.182 --> 30:17.548
That doesn't even rhyme.

30:17.550 --> 30:19.516
Where is the paradise?

30:20.953 --> 30:22.519
Willard is clever, you see.

30:22.521 --> 30:24.488
He left a trail of clues.

30:24.490 --> 30:28.025
We just follow them and boom.
Instant Willard.

30:28.294 --> 30:30.561
I love a mystery, sir.

30:30.930 --> 30:31.895
Lead on.

30:31.897 --> 30:33.463
We are going all right.

30:33.465 --> 30:35.098
(Laughing, clapping)

30:35.100 --> 30:39.536
Yes. Home sweet home.
I am already sick for it.

30:39.538 --> 30:42.506
We are going all the way
up there and beyond.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.208
That's where Willard went.

30:44.210 --> 30:46.043
And that's where he is.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.578
Oh!

30:48.214 --> 30:50.180
Robu, pack my scarf.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.383
Looks like we might
be hiking in the snow.

30:53.519 --> 30:56.019
I am going to need my deicer.

30:57.990 --> 31:00.891
Professor Shonku. My feet.

31:01.060 --> 31:02.626
Yes, bring them.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.428
Do you know anyone in the
village..

31:04.430 --> 31:06.897
..who could serve as
a guide up the mountains?

31:06.899 --> 31:08.398
Yes, professor.

31:10.169 --> 31:13.203
Markovitch could do this. That's
me.

31:13.906 --> 31:16.039
Many times I have
been up the mountains.

31:16.041 --> 31:18.442
Excellent. And we will need some
yaks.

31:18.444 --> 31:21.945
My uncle Gargovitch
is known for his yaks.

31:21.947 --> 31:23.614
I can get good price.

31:23.616 --> 31:28.285
Yaks. A yak once bit
and spit on my Systasvia.

31:28.888 --> 31:31.922
Is she coming with us?
- No.

31:32.224 --> 31:33.423
Perfect.

31:33.626 --> 31:35.259
2 yaks if you please.

31:35.261 --> 31:37.561
And I would like to
leave as soon as possible.

31:45.070 --> 31:47.604
Let's go guys. Willard awaits.

31:58.217 --> 32:00.584
What is this disturbing kind of
music?

32:01.587 --> 32:03.520
I forgot to use my buds.

32:04.023 --> 32:07.124
Everybody keep an eye
out for the whim of the sun.

32:07.126 --> 32:09.326
I don't know what it could look
like?

32:09.328 --> 32:10.627
What's a whim?

32:11.230 --> 32:13.263
I guess we will know
when we will see it.

32:45.998 --> 32:49.466
Sir, I hear a distinct rumble.
- Yes.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.469
Sorry. It must be my gastronomy.

32:52.471 --> 32:55.405
I am feeling the
need of a snack already.

32:57.443 --> 33:00.444
Me too. But that's not stomach.

33:00.446 --> 33:03.513
Oh yes. It is.
It's where my food goes.

33:04.016 --> 33:06.616
He means the rumble. It's that.

33:07.586 --> 33:08.986
(Scares)

33:09.188 --> 33:11.254
Be very, very quiet.

33:11.256 --> 33:14.191
The slightest moment could
trigger.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.462
Avalanche.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.535
Run!

33:33.712 --> 33:36.046
Mo! Harmony!

33:36.281 --> 33:37.581
Melody!

33:38.183 --> 33:40.384
I don't care. Just go.

33:40.386 --> 33:41.651
Melody! Melody!

33:48.427 --> 33:50.160
Robu!

33:50.162 --> 33:51.561
Robu!

33:56.235 --> 33:57.734
He is gone.

33:57.736 --> 33:59.269
No!

34:00.272 --> 34:01.571
No!

34:09.715 --> 34:12.549
Mo! Harmony! I assure you.

34:13.385 --> 34:17.087
I nearly turned my
deicer under full blast.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.724
Robu. You gave us such a scare.

34:20.726 --> 34:23.726
Do not hug me yet.
Or you will get such a burn.

34:24.063 --> 34:26.129
I am still emanating heat.

34:38.110 --> 34:45.081
According to Willard's
co-ordinates
the temple should be right here.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.384
Here?

34:47.386 --> 34:49.386
It has to be here.

34:49.588 --> 34:53.556
Ancient temples just
don't disappear. I mean...

34:53.559 --> 34:56.626
I am right.
Right? They don't just do that.

34:57.463 --> 35:00.297
No temple.
That's what I am saying,
professor.

35:00.299 --> 35:03.467
Maybe the aliens took
it back to their home planet.

35:05.104 --> 35:07.204
Aliens will come, right?

35:09.341 --> 35:11.508
Perhaps try the satellite mode.

35:12.111 --> 35:13.877
I was just getting to that.

35:17.449 --> 35:19.683
The whim of the sun.

35:20.152 --> 35:23.386
Whim. Whim. Sun.

35:24.189 --> 35:25.589
Found it!

35:28.660 --> 35:30.727
What have you found, professor?

35:31.563 --> 35:33.697
Don't disturb, Harmony.

35:34.500 --> 35:36.133
Melody.

35:36.135 --> 35:39.169
We are going to camp on top
of this mountain?

35:39.171 --> 35:41.705
What if we freeze or slide off?

35:42.641 --> 35:45.142
Nope. Nothing.

35:47.846 --> 35:52.415
Maybe here. Nope. Here for sure.

35:53.152 --> 35:54.251
No.

35:55.921 --> 35:56.920
(Excited)

35:56.922 --> 35:58.455
Here we go.

36:00.659 --> 36:05.228
We will be sleeping inside
tonight.
Just like Willard did.

36:09.334 --> 36:11.168
A secret entrance.

36:12.171 --> 36:13.870
What's down inside?

36:15.374 --> 36:16.706
The aliens.

36:17.576 --> 36:19.342
Avi!
- Avi!

36:19.344 --> 36:23.346
(Groaning)

36:23.715 --> 36:25.582
Avi!
- Avi!

36:25.784 --> 36:30.787
I've reached the bottom. Ouch!
Monster!

36:30.789 --> 36:34.624
Robu! We might need
some light on the stairs.

36:34.626 --> 36:38.795
I am okay.
Only frightened from the
grounding.

36:39.431 --> 36:43.567
I see a light.
I am hoping it's you, professor.

36:51.510 --> 36:55.212
Welcome to the temple of Taurus.

36:55.214 --> 36:59.749
Wow! Now that's a secret
passage.

37:04.923 --> 37:07.357
It's beautiful.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.927
Now let's find your father.

37:11.296 --> 37:14.364
Journey forth to a
paradise where we dwell.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.500
True character leads the
way at the whim of the sun.

37:17.502 --> 37:19.502
Glimmering through the arc of
mist.

37:19.504 --> 37:22.439
A sleeping sentinel lays in
Unity.

37:22.874 --> 37:26.443
What's a sleeping sentinel?
Does it bite?

37:26.445 --> 37:28.245
It's like a guard.

37:28.247 --> 37:30.780
A guard. What is he guarding?

37:30.782 --> 37:35.552
Alright, let's spread out
and find a sleeping sentinel.

37:36.021 --> 37:38.755
Also there's a note from
Willard.

37:38.924 --> 37:41.424
Beware of the snow bats.

37:41.426 --> 37:42.626
Good to know.

37:42.628 --> 37:45.028
Watch out for snow bats
everyone.

37:45.831 --> 37:46.763
Avi.

37:46.765 --> 37:49.266
(Screaming)

37:49.268 --> 37:51.434
I believe they have been found.

37:52.404 --> 37:55.872
Bats! Help. Help me.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.042
Hang on, Avi.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.783
Go away, go away bats!

38:08.420 --> 38:10.787
Do not let them bite you.

38:10.789 --> 38:14.457
Tell that to them please and
quickly.

38:17.029 --> 38:19.896
So Robu, what's for dinner?

38:24.436 --> 38:26.670
Good night to everyone. Bye.

38:26.672 --> 38:28.338
Good night everyone.

38:28.340 --> 38:30.373
Good night everyone.

38:37.649 --> 38:40.016
Do you really think that dad's
alive?

38:40.018 --> 38:44.354
I don't just think it Mo.
I feel it. He has to be.

38:44.523 --> 38:47.457
The professor wouldn't drag us
here,
if he didn't believe it too.

38:47.459 --> 38:51.995
But look at us.
You. Me. Markovitch. Avi.

38:52.331 --> 38:54.698
And a professor who
can't remember one name.

38:54.700 --> 38:55.932
And a robot.

38:55.934 --> 39:00.670
Dad trusted Shonku with his life
on more than one occasion.

39:00.806 --> 39:03.039
So I trust dad's judgement.

39:04.543 --> 39:07.711
(Snoring)

39:18.523 --> 39:19.923
You are up early.

39:20.492 --> 39:22.792
(Yawning) Can't sleep.

39:22.794 --> 39:26.463
Spider bite.
Bed bugs? The ancient temple
curse.

39:26.465 --> 39:29.065
Or were you dreaming
about Avi's aliens.

39:29.067 --> 39:31.401
Just thinking about dad.

39:34.473 --> 39:38.141
One time Willard and I were
searching for pirate treasure..

39:38.143 --> 39:40.443
..at the bottom of Shark Tooth's
Bay.

39:40.445 --> 39:44.647
There in the sand I saw a gold
bloom.
18th century.

39:44.649 --> 39:48.118
What I didn't see was
a 14 feet tiger shark..

39:48.120 --> 39:51.788
...coming up behind me...
jaws open like this.

39:51.790 --> 39:53.590
How did you get away?

39:53.592 --> 39:55.925
Your father. He swam behind me.

39:56.161 --> 39:57.794
Punched the shark.

39:58.697 --> 40:02.866
Grabbed his dorsal fin
and rode it into a kelp forest.

40:03.702 --> 40:05.101
Then what happened?

40:05.103 --> 40:08.138
Your father's tough. I'll find
him.

40:13.412 --> 40:14.611
Wow.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.083
Is that the morning sun?

40:20.519 --> 40:21.818
(Yawning)

40:21.953 --> 40:24.521
Morning comes early around here.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.189
Right on time.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.725
They probably put this temple
here..

40:28.727 --> 40:31.027
..exactly to catch the sun's
rays.

40:31.029 --> 40:32.061
And...

40:32.063 --> 40:37.734
Catch the sun's rays. Of course.
Robu, move.

40:37.736 --> 40:41.538
I want the shadows to
fall as the ancients intended.

40:43.909 --> 40:47.744
I see a shadow that
has to be deliberate. Right?

40:48.013 --> 40:50.947
Of course.
But what do you think it is?

40:53.919 --> 40:58.054
2 butterflies fighting
while riding motorcycles.

40:58.557 --> 41:00.023
What about now?

41:01.493 --> 41:04.527
Monkey hitting a coconut
with a cricket bat.

41:04.529 --> 41:08.598
Don't be silly.
It's a clue. Watch the shape.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.970
I don't know.
What do you see, professor?

41:14.206 --> 41:15.672
Bull.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.774
No, really. What do you see?

41:18.143 --> 41:22.579
He is right. It's a bull. Here.

41:22.581 --> 41:25.515
This is the tail.
The body starts here.

41:25.917 --> 41:29.819
Right? Its fat in the
middle leading to the neck.

41:30.021 --> 41:32.021
And these are the horns.

41:32.023 --> 41:34.591
They are pointing there.

41:41.600 --> 41:43.500
What are we looking for?

41:43.502 --> 41:45.134
A sleeping man.

41:46.505 --> 41:49.939
It's the sentinel. Dad was
right.

41:50.609 --> 41:52.909
Willard is a very smart man.

41:57.148 --> 41:59.215
We are going to follow that
path.

41:59.217 --> 42:00.750
Robu!

42:07.092 --> 42:09.292
I do have an alarm function,
sir.

42:09.294 --> 42:12.795
I know. But how often
do I really get to do that?

42:12.797 --> 42:16.299
Eat a hearty breakfast my
friends.
Big day ahead.

42:20.672 --> 42:22.071
We are coming dad.

42:36.154 --> 42:37.854
Come along everyone.

42:37.856 --> 42:40.957
We should be at the Kung-pao
river by lunch time.

42:41.826 --> 42:45.795
I like the sound of lunch.
But a river.

42:45.797 --> 42:49.032
My parents never
taught young me to swim.

42:49.034 --> 42:51.868
Don't worry, Avi.
We won't be swimming.

42:51.870 --> 42:53.636
It will be frozen over.

42:53.638 --> 42:56.706
We could just walk across.
It's like ice skating.

42:56.708 --> 42:58.107
When I was with little
Markovitch..

42:58.109 --> 43:00.944
..I remember going Bengal
tiger hunting in Sahara..

43:00.946 --> 43:02.779
..with my uncle Snargoritch.

43:02.781 --> 43:05.715
Wow. Did you see one?
- I should hope not.

43:05.717 --> 43:08.217
There aren't any
Bengal tigers in Sahara.

43:08.219 --> 43:09.752
(Laughing)

43:09.754 --> 43:12.322
Maybe that's why we never saw
any.

43:30.375 --> 43:31.741
Yeah.

43:32.877 --> 43:35.278
We can walk over it. I can
just...

43:38.850 --> 43:40.283
(Laughing)

43:40.285 --> 43:42.785
- I think I should use the sled.
- (Laughing)

43:45.890 --> 43:46.923
(Groaning)

43:50.629 --> 43:53.296
Once we cross, what's next
professor?

43:53.298 --> 43:56.933
Willard's note suggests
we go off trail to save time.

43:57.769 --> 43:59.802
We can pick up the trail again
here.

44:00.071 --> 44:03.640
We should stay on the trail.
- Really Markovitch?

44:03.642 --> 44:06.242
An adventurer like
you playing it safe!

44:06.244 --> 44:07.276
(Laughing)

44:07.278 --> 44:09.646
Not for me, of course.

44:09.648 --> 44:12.215
For the sake of the
children naturally.

44:12.217 --> 44:15.284
And what would happen
to your reputation..

44:15.286 --> 44:17.353
..if should any harm come to
them?

44:18.356 --> 44:20.056
All right. Fine.

44:20.058 --> 44:22.959
We will do things the Markovitch
way.

44:22.961 --> 44:24.861
Everyone get on the sled.

44:31.736 --> 44:32.969
Careful.

44:34.305 --> 44:37.040
Robu. Wind speed if you please.

44:38.710 --> 44:42.779
4 knots sir, from the north.
No. Northeast.

44:42.781 --> 44:45.381
Slight chance of flurries
if that matters to you.

44:45.750 --> 44:46.983
The road ahead?

44:47.318 --> 44:49.752
Smooth as ice this time.

45:14.779 --> 45:15.845
The ice.

45:16.247 --> 45:17.380
It's crackling!

45:17.816 --> 45:18.881
The yaks!

45:20.485 --> 45:23.186
(Screaming)

45:29.260 --> 45:30.460
Robu!

45:32.197 --> 45:34.831
(Screaming)

45:44.476 --> 45:47.076
Professor. The sled has no
brakes.

45:47.412 --> 45:49.512
An obvious design flaw.

45:49.514 --> 45:52.749
(Screaming)

45:53.752 --> 45:55.885
I suggest everyone should
hold on to something..

45:55.887 --> 45:57.420
..as if their lives depended on
it.

45:59.824 --> 46:00.957
No!

46:07.065 --> 46:11.200
(Screaming)

46:12.137 --> 46:14.337
Remind you of anything, Robu?

46:14.906 --> 46:18.241
That time you and Willard
hit the white water at the
Semetite.

46:18.243 --> 46:21.210
Yes, and what was waiting
for us in the end?

46:21.846 --> 46:26.082
I believe it was a waterfall,
sir.
A big drop.

46:26.251 --> 46:27.950
Precisely.

46:28.486 --> 46:32.255
Hold on tight!
It is time for this. Robu.

46:36.494 --> 46:38.528
I am the Spiderman.

46:38.530 --> 46:39.896
Firing.

46:46.037 --> 46:47.537
It's working.

46:48.306 --> 46:51.274
I should have not looked down.

46:52.577 --> 46:55.077
I should never looked. I should
not.

46:55.480 --> 46:59.315
Melody, dad's phone!.
- No, it's gone.

46:59.517 --> 47:02.585
Markovitch! You saved it.

47:18.937 --> 47:20.970
(Screaming)

47:27.946 --> 47:31.013
(Screaming)

47:37.355 --> 47:40.456
(Screaming)

47:49.033 --> 47:51.434
(Screaming)

47:51.636 --> 47:54.570
I think I am feeling queasy
again.

47:54.572 --> 47:55.972
Hold still, Mr. Avi.

47:55.974 --> 47:58.541
(Groaning)

47:59.510 --> 48:03.579
Memo to us, Robu.
Our next sled needs a brake.

48:04.148 --> 48:05.915
Duly noted, sir.

48:06.217 --> 48:10.119
Good news, everyone.
We just saved four days.

48:17.962 --> 48:22.098
What is young Mo and
her boys seen her Bolov?

48:22.467 --> 48:26.135
I believe your people
in your movies have a saying..

48:26.137 --> 48:29.338
..for the situation
of things such as these.

48:30.041 --> 48:31.240
Stick 'em up.

48:31.910 --> 48:33.442
Not you Bolov.

48:34.345 --> 48:37.380
When is a snowball
ever shy of an avalanche?

48:37.382 --> 48:40.082
If you know what I mean.
(Laughing)

48:40.084 --> 48:44.053
Welcome, intruders to Yamu's
valley.

48:44.355 --> 48:46.923
I am Yamu.

48:47.158 --> 48:49.258
Bandit.
- Well, duhh!

48:49.260 --> 48:52.295
Your valley? It's quite nice
actually.

48:52.931 --> 48:54.497
Could be less chilly though.

48:55.066 --> 48:56.265
Silence.

48:56.935 --> 48:58.701
You are trespassing.

48:59.070 --> 49:02.605
And according to the
first law of Yamu's valley..

49:03.041 --> 49:05.174
..you shall be punished.

49:05.176 --> 49:07.443
Your valley almost killed us.

49:07.445 --> 49:09.712
We have lost all our supplies.

49:09.714 --> 49:12.048
And my bones are freezing.

49:12.050 --> 49:13.683
Quit that jibber jabber.

49:18.556 --> 49:24.060
My judgement is swift
and final like a Yeti's belch.

49:24.362 --> 49:27.430
Now I am nice enough to give a
choice.

49:27.565 --> 49:30.099
You can go home safely.

49:30.101 --> 49:33.602
Just leave me the mechanical
fellow.

49:34.739 --> 49:36.672
You mean little old me?

49:36.674 --> 49:38.641
Are you made from car parts?

49:38.643 --> 49:41.444
No, that metal fellow over
there.

49:41.446 --> 49:43.412
That's simply not possible.

49:44.482 --> 49:47.316
Because he is not
working well you know.

49:47.318 --> 49:49.285
He is looking fine to me.

49:49.287 --> 49:53.522
And my looking is all that
matters around in these parts.

50:00.498 --> 50:02.531
His name is Robu.

50:02.533 --> 50:05.534
I have been teaching
him sign language.

50:05.703 --> 50:09.205
Obviously,
there is still some work to do.

50:09.207 --> 50:12.608
What's he trying to say?
Is he out of oil?

50:12.610 --> 50:16.645
No. I believe he is trying
to tell me what I have got to
do.

50:18.449 --> 50:20.683
This.
- Let them have it boys.

50:21.586 --> 50:23.386
Get to cover everyone.

50:26.190 --> 50:27.456
Come on, Mo.

50:30.728 --> 50:32.361
Keep it up, old man.

50:32.630 --> 50:36.032
Yamu's law rules these parts.

50:37.602 --> 50:40.469
How are you snow ball skills?
- Yes.

50:40.772 --> 50:42.538
All right Yamu.

50:43.141 --> 50:45.708
Obviously you are too smart for
me.

50:45.710 --> 50:48.411
I got to think of
the children of course.

50:48.546 --> 50:50.212
Now would be great.

50:52.483 --> 50:53.716
Bull's eye.

50:58.389 --> 51:00.322
They are standing still.

51:00.324 --> 51:02.491
What kind of a gun is that?

51:02.493 --> 51:07.096
I call it Shonku shooter.
Harmless, sort of.

51:07.098 --> 51:09.698
The darts are packed
with my own invention.

51:09.700 --> 51:14.270
Nightmarium, an extract
of a plant your father and I..

51:14.272 --> 51:16.739
..found growing at
the edge of the Limpopo.

51:16.741 --> 51:19.208
It's put them to sleep?

51:19.510 --> 51:21.911
Eventually.

51:21.912 --> 51:24.313
But first they should get
really,
really scared.

51:24.315 --> 51:26.082
Should be fun.

51:35.193 --> 51:37.593
(Screaming)

51:38.729 --> 51:41.363
Sleepy time. Good night.

51:42.834 --> 51:44.667
Pleasant dreams.

51:45.536 --> 51:47.670
I don't know what
you have done to my boys.

51:47.672 --> 51:52.441
But I do know your kind
would not strike a woman.

51:52.710 --> 51:55.711
You are absolutely right.
Of course Yamu.

51:56.180 --> 51:58.447
That's why I let my friend do
it.

51:58.449 --> 51:59.615
Sorry.

52:00.118 --> 52:01.717
(Groaning)

52:04.722 --> 52:07.223
I am only going to ask once,
Yamu.

52:07.225 --> 52:08.891
Where did you get the watch?

52:08.893 --> 52:11.127
What are you talking about?

52:11.129 --> 52:13.162
Can I punch her next?

52:14.332 --> 52:17.333
The watch please. We are all
waiting.

52:19.203 --> 52:21.537
I wonder what kind of
nightmares..

52:21.539 --> 52:24.140
..a mountain bandit queen might
have.

52:24.742 --> 52:27.576
It was a gift from my Charlie.

52:27.712 --> 52:31.147
Charlie! You mean Charles
Willard?

52:31.149 --> 52:35.151
Yes, of course. Do you know him?

52:35.153 --> 52:39.221
He is wonderful. Isn't he?

52:39.357 --> 52:40.623
What?

52:41.626 --> 52:43.859
Enough of that chit chat.

52:43.861 --> 52:46.262
Do you have any food, lady
bandit?

52:46.264 --> 52:48.397
For all of us I speak
when I say that..

52:48.399 --> 52:52.201
..hunger is moving
mountains inside my tummy.

52:57.408 --> 52:59.875
Charlie passed through here for
sure.

53:00.578 --> 53:03.179
He was tired from his travels.

53:03.181 --> 53:06.749
But otherwise finer than a yak
here.

53:06.751 --> 53:08.450
Very excited.

53:08.452 --> 53:10.553
He had to find something.

53:10.721 --> 53:12.955
A dream well thing.

53:13.291 --> 53:15.691
A beautiful, beautiful man.

53:15.826 --> 53:19.895
He was with us for a week.
Maybe more. Maybe less.

53:19.897 --> 53:22.731
Time loses its way up here.

53:23.301 --> 53:25.968
But where did he go?
- We fed him.

53:25.970 --> 53:29.305
He told me stories
of his great adventures..

53:29.307 --> 53:33.976
..with his two children
and you professor Shonku.

53:33.978 --> 53:37.546
What happened to dad?
- We are here to find him.

53:37.682 --> 53:39.915
He gave me the watch as a gift.

53:39.917 --> 53:42.751
Saying that he will return
once he finished..

53:42.753 --> 53:45.688
..his business in the mountains.

53:45.690 --> 53:47.523
Where in the mountains?

53:47.525 --> 53:49.525
Could you make us a map?
- Even better.

53:49.794 --> 53:53.996
At first light, I will
take you to where Charlie left
me.

53:53.998 --> 53:56.232
I mean us.

53:56.234 --> 53:57.933
Do you also serve breakfast?

53:57.935 --> 54:01.971
Yes, the food is good here.
3 stars. Easy.

54:02.340 --> 54:04.707
You know in the village
where I was born.

54:04.709 --> 54:09.545
My grandmother Glarkowitch used
to
make a wonderful porridge
breakfast.

54:13.718 --> 54:17.620
This is as far as we go.
Good luck professor.

54:17.622 --> 54:20.589
So long, Yamu. We will find
Willard.

54:20.758 --> 54:24.560
Tell my little Charlie,
I am waiting for him.

54:24.562 --> 54:25.561
Good bye.

54:26.564 --> 54:28.464
Thank you.
- Goodbye.

54:28.466 --> 54:30.633
Bye, bye.
- Thanks for the yak cheese.

55:10.541 --> 55:13.642
Yikes is the word for this.

55:13.644 --> 55:17.346
This? Dad went across this?

55:17.848 --> 55:20.316
We can do it with our eyes
closed.

55:20.318 --> 55:21.784
Who is first to go over there.

55:21.786 --> 55:24.386
Not Avi. That is for being
certain.

55:24.555 --> 55:28.324
I should go.
The unknown, I am used to.

55:28.326 --> 55:33.429
No! I should go.
I am smaller and weigh less.

55:33.597 --> 55:36.065
Nonsense. I am going...
- Hurry up.

55:36.634 --> 55:39.535
While you old ladies are
discussing rescue etiquette..

55:39.537 --> 55:41.503
..I am already half way to dad.

55:41.505 --> 55:42.738
Harmony!

55:45.509 --> 55:48.010
Melody! And I am fine. the
bridge is...

55:48.012 --> 55:49.078
(Screaming)

55:49.080 --> 55:50.512
Hold on.

55:51.782 --> 55:53.048
Melody.

55:57.855 --> 56:00.522
I am okay.

56:07.698 --> 56:08.831
Sis!

56:10.101 --> 56:11.834
(Screaming)

56:11.836 --> 56:13.969
Harmony!
- Melody!

56:15.973 --> 56:19.808
Stay right there.
I am coming over somehow.

56:19.810 --> 56:22.978
Grab the wall.
Dig you fingers into the ice.

56:26.417 --> 56:27.950
(Screaming)

56:29.387 --> 56:30.953
I cannot look.

56:31.489 --> 56:33.088
Okay a little.

56:37.762 --> 56:40.162
I can see you right through it.

56:42.500 --> 56:43.866
It's not ice.

56:44.735 --> 56:48.737
It's crystal. Pure crystal.

56:49.807 --> 56:51.106
Professor.

56:54.412 --> 56:56.712
I think I found a way out.

57:05.623 --> 57:07.723
This is the way to go professor.

57:07.725 --> 57:10.893
Those things aren't carved
into the cliff by accident.

57:11.195 --> 57:12.594
Professor.

57:18.536 --> 57:20.836
It's got to be here somewhere.

57:21.572 --> 57:23.772
What?

57:23.773 --> 57:25.973
Look where we are.
Where does this bridge go?

57:29.113 --> 57:30.979
To a secret door.

57:31.482 --> 57:33.482
See how much fun this is.

57:34.819 --> 57:38.654
This is why your father and I
do... Aha!

57:38.656 --> 57:40.489
What is it? What's wrong?

57:40.891 --> 57:43.225
Nothing. I want you to do it.

57:46.197 --> 57:50.566
Righty. Tighty.
So here's this thing. Here we
go.

57:59.009 --> 58:01.910
Hurry up, everyone. We are going
in.
- Come on.

58:06.784 --> 58:07.883
(Laughing)

58:21.966 --> 58:23.732
What are you going to do?

58:24.101 --> 58:26.268
I am going to touch it of
course.

58:32.776 --> 58:33.909
Dad!

58:34.245 --> 58:37.145
Are you in here?
Answer us.

58:40.017 --> 58:42.684
You check over there.
I will look over here.

58:42.686 --> 58:45.821
If I find something
I will just scream.

58:46.724 --> 58:49.658
(Screaming)

58:50.961 --> 58:52.194
Oh my!

59:01.705 --> 59:04.106
What an amazing place!

59:05.910 --> 59:08.076
They really knew how to build.

59:08.746 --> 59:12.881
Uransutra. A treatise on flying.

59:13.050 --> 59:14.917
You know Sanskrit?

59:14.919 --> 59:18.020
Of course. Dad taught us both.

59:18.656 --> 59:21.823
And yes, the girls
at school think I am weird.

59:22.192 --> 59:24.993
Leap of faith. Flying monks.

59:25.229 --> 59:28.330
Piercing the clouds
over the dream world.

59:29.066 --> 59:30.332
Dream world!

59:30.734 --> 59:34.836
Willard was here.
That's great, Melody.

59:36.106 --> 59:38.707
I don't think this is their
library.

59:38.976 --> 59:43.111
It's a laboratory.
Someone made stuff here.

59:43.314 --> 59:46.782
Stuff. That's not very
scientific.

59:46.784 --> 59:48.116
But this is.

59:48.118 --> 59:52.087
Formulas for invisibility,
invincibility.

59:52.089 --> 59:55.724
Some anti-gravity
thing called Neugborn.

59:56.193 --> 59:58.327
Turn the pages while I take
photos.

59:58.329 --> 01:00:01.229
I will fill up a new diary in no
time.

01:00:02.866 --> 01:00:06.101
Nothing. No sign of dad
anywhere.

01:00:06.837 --> 01:00:10.973
And no refrigerator either.
Not a speck of food.

01:00:10.975 --> 01:00:13.141
You know what I miss when I
travel?

01:00:13.277 --> 01:00:14.676
Hamburgers.

01:00:14.678 --> 01:00:17.946
I miss being safe at in my own
house.

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:20.282
Granola bar.

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:21.917
Please.

01:00:36.934 --> 01:00:39.167
It's me. I have found it.

01:00:39.169 --> 01:00:43.071
Enough gold to paint the city.
It's everywhere.

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:48.677
Yes, I am activating the GPS
now.

01:00:48.912 --> 01:00:51.747
Bring bags with you. Big bags.

01:00:51.749 --> 01:00:53.015
And someone to carry them.

01:00:53.017 --> 01:00:55.951
Don't worry.

01:00:55.952 --> 01:00:58.886
If there are any problems,
I still have bullets in my guns.

01:01:01.992 --> 01:01:04.292
Wow! That's bright.

01:01:04.662 --> 01:01:07.429
Why is it so bright
at this time of the day?

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:11.033
Sunlight! At last.

01:01:11.335 --> 01:01:12.768
(Sighs)

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:14.703
It's reflected light.

01:01:14.872 --> 01:01:19.875
Leap of faith, piercing
the clouds over the dream world.

01:01:20.244 --> 01:01:22.110
That's got to be the wall.

01:01:22.112 --> 01:01:24.212
Then we are going over it.

01:01:24.848 --> 01:01:26.882
Has anyone seen Markovitch?

01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:33.021
Mr. Markovitch, what are you
doing?

01:01:35.759 --> 01:01:37.392
I am flying out of here.

01:01:37.394 --> 01:01:39.995
I am going to be one rich
Markovitch.

01:01:39.997 --> 01:01:42.197
Richer than my cousin
Porguvitch.

01:01:45.302 --> 01:01:49.071
Markovitch!
I made an astounding discovery.

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:56.945
That you are just
a common temple robber.

01:01:56.947 --> 01:01:59.881
I am much more than that,
professor.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:03.018
(Sighing)

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.757
I thought I might have to shoot
you.

01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:11.860
But once I discover
the power of these boots.

01:02:11.862 --> 01:02:14.863
Of course. Mun Lung.

01:02:17.234 --> 01:02:19.000
Good luck, professor.

01:02:19.002 --> 01:02:21.803
Markovitch has to meet his ride
home.

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:30.145
Professor, I found a whole
room full of flying boots.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:31.480
Here.

01:02:34.184 --> 01:02:36.384
Leap of faith! Leap of faith!

01:02:38.322 --> 01:02:40.239
Melody!

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:42.157
You need boots to take
another step young Mo.

01:02:42.159 --> 01:02:43.492
(Excited)

01:02:43.494 --> 01:02:47.329
Dad's up here somewhere.
Leap of faith, professor.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:51.967
She reminds me of me, Robu.
- She is faster.

01:02:52.970 --> 01:02:55.337
We will see about that. Avi.

01:02:55.339 --> 01:02:59.241
I know. We are all going to fly
now.
Aren't we?

01:02:59.243 --> 01:03:03.278
It's my curse for finding
a room full of flying boots.

01:03:05.215 --> 01:03:06.948
This is great.

01:03:12.823 --> 01:03:14.389
(Excited)

01:03:14.858 --> 01:03:16.491
I am going to beat you.

01:03:16.827 --> 01:03:19.294
(Laughing) Never. Watch.

01:03:19.296 --> 01:03:21.396
(Screaming)

01:03:21.398 --> 01:03:23.298
Professor.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:28.336
Yeah!

01:03:32.176 --> 01:03:35.177
It's beautiful.

01:03:36.013 --> 01:03:40.015
It's the garden of dreams.
Willard was right.

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:42.984
It is the garden of wonders.

01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:50.292
(Sneezing)

01:03:50.294 --> 01:03:54.196
This is going to make
my allergies act up.

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:56.464
(Screaming)

01:04:04.908 --> 01:04:07.008
Let's see where they landed.

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.048
And what else is out here?

01:04:19.456 --> 01:04:20.956
Fascinating.

01:04:21.491 --> 01:04:23.491
It's your Shonkuscope sir.

01:04:23.493 --> 01:04:25.527
The frequency must irritate it.

01:04:25.996 --> 01:04:27.929
I am going to like it here.

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:46.047
(Laughing)

01:05:01.365 --> 01:05:05.066
Beautiful. There is money here.

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:07.269
Maybe money, money.

01:05:07.271 --> 01:05:11.006
Get me plants, animals, insects.

01:05:11.008 --> 01:05:13.675
Dirt from the ground.
Everything.

01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:16.011
Grab them all, boys.

01:05:16.346 --> 01:05:18.113
And be careful.

01:05:26.189 --> 01:05:27.322
Idiots!

01:05:40.637 --> 01:05:43.939
Beautiful. It's just beautiful.

01:05:49.980 --> 01:05:52.681
They have to be around here
somewhere.

01:05:55.252 --> 01:05:56.952
I can hear them.

01:06:04.428 --> 01:06:06.561
My bad. It is a bull.

01:06:07.531 --> 01:06:10.231
I thought it is a bull.
It is a Minotaur.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:11.733
Yikes.

01:06:16.406 --> 01:06:19.207
Avi!
- Running away now.

01:06:31.121 --> 01:06:32.320
I am trapped.

01:06:35.058 --> 01:06:38.226
3 against 1. I like those odds.

01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:45.133
Get ready, my friends.

01:06:47.371 --> 01:06:48.921
Willard!

01:06:48.922 --> 01:06:50.472
Professor. What took you so
long?

01:06:50.474 --> 01:06:52.240
My best man.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:55.110
(Laughing)

01:06:55.112 --> 01:06:57.645
We were expecting maybe a
minotaur.

01:06:57.647 --> 01:06:59.714
Oh yes, I saw. I sent him away.

01:06:59.716 --> 01:07:02.217
You can do that when
you speak Minotaurium.

01:07:02.552 --> 01:07:04.786
I had a lot of free time.

01:07:04.788 --> 01:07:07.655
You really should leave
tougher clues next time.

01:07:07.657 --> 01:07:10.658
I knew it was you as
soon as I saw the airship.

01:07:10.660 --> 01:07:13.461
Airship? I don't have an
airship.

01:07:14.631 --> 01:07:16.398
Franzotti!

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.767
That's got to be
Markovitch's ride home.

01:07:18.769 --> 01:07:21.202
He set me up from the very
beginning.

01:07:46.630 --> 01:07:49.397
Okay. Stop. We are lost.

01:07:53.170 --> 01:07:54.469
Seriously.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:57.138
Want a bite.

01:07:57.340 --> 01:07:58.773
(Screaming)

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:00.141
Mo!

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:04.279
Melody!

01:08:10.754 --> 01:08:13.121
(Groaning)

01:08:13.824 --> 01:08:16.825
(Groaning)

01:08:19.662 --> 01:08:20.828
Saved.

01:08:22.265 --> 01:08:23.765
So now what?

01:08:25.535 --> 01:08:28.502
(Sighing)

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:47.455
Remind me to thank dad
for teaching us to swim.

01:08:49.126 --> 01:08:51.158
Be very, very quiet.

01:08:56.133 --> 01:08:58.733
Unicorn! Wow.

01:08:59.336 --> 01:09:00.801
Dad was right.

01:09:00.804 --> 01:09:02.737
Wait till the professor sees it.

01:09:03.607 --> 01:09:04.805
What?

01:09:05.175 --> 01:09:05.707
No!

01:09:05.709 --> 01:09:06.608
(Laughing)

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:08.376
Markovitch!
- Stop!

01:09:18.188 --> 01:09:20.721
I can't believe you
brought my kids with you.

01:09:20.724 --> 01:09:24.158
I didn't bring them. They
brought me.

01:09:25.162 --> 01:09:27.828
I am here because
of a misunderstanding..

01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:30.465
..with the mangoes
I have already eaten.

01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:35.236
This is the place Shonku
from the tablet. This is it.

01:09:42.312 --> 01:09:45.446
I came over the dream
world with those boots.

01:09:52.656 --> 01:09:54.822
And when I crashed into a tree..

01:09:55.258 --> 01:09:58.860
..I broke my shoulder,
injured my leg too.

01:09:59.629 --> 01:10:00.962
I couldn't walk.

01:10:01.431 --> 01:10:03.298
There was no doctor here you
know.

01:10:03.300 --> 01:10:06.201
None. I was on my own.

01:10:06.403 --> 01:10:07.602
I was sure I was going to die.

01:10:12.509 --> 01:10:16.211
Fortunately I was near
a grove of orange trees.

01:10:16.213 --> 01:10:18.546
So I started eating the fruit.

01:10:22.452 --> 01:10:23.952
Delicious.

01:10:25.689 --> 01:10:28.556
I started getting stronger.
Better even.

01:10:30.694 --> 01:10:33.595
I wanted to get back
home to my children.

01:10:33.597 --> 01:10:35.730
So as soon as I felt strong
enough..

01:10:35.732 --> 01:10:39.267
..I packed for the journey
and started down the mountains.

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:43.871
As I passed the dream wall..

01:10:44.274 --> 01:10:46.641
..I noticed something horrible.

01:10:47.277 --> 01:10:49.844
I started to fade away.

01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:53.781
The fruit had altered
my body chemistry.

01:10:55.352 --> 01:10:57.418
I can't leave.

01:10:57.988 --> 01:11:01.389
There has to be a cure. Has to.

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.960
I would rather starve than
disappear.

01:11:06.529 --> 01:11:08.463
Their ship is this way. Come on.

01:11:12.702 --> 01:11:14.669
(Laughing)

01:11:19.509 --> 01:11:20.908
(Whistling)

01:11:31.621 --> 01:11:32.954
What are they doing?

01:11:33.323 --> 01:11:35.290
They are robbing the place.

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:45.667
Here's what we will do.
We will commit them from...

01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:46.768
(Sneezing)

01:11:46.903 --> 01:11:49.070
Allergies! I knew it.

01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:54.876
Don't bother with the plan,
little children.

01:11:55.512 --> 01:11:57.745
We dig the professor
who try to free you.

01:11:57.747 --> 01:11:59.781
(Laughing)

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:02.417
Plan A just became extinct.

01:12:02.652 --> 01:12:05.720
You had a plan B, right? Right?

01:12:05.722 --> 01:12:11.025
(Laughing) Plan B.
You children are adorable.

01:12:13.530 --> 01:12:17.031
Markovitch, you were
magnificent.

01:12:17.634 --> 01:12:19.567
It was easy.

01:12:19.569 --> 01:12:23.504
The professor is as easy
to trick as baby Karkovitch.

01:12:26.409 --> 01:12:29.377
I may name it this one after
myself.

01:12:31.915 --> 01:12:32.847
(Sighs)

01:12:32.849 --> 01:12:37.118
The spawns of the Charles
Willard.
Welcome.

01:12:43.093 --> 01:12:44.859
Melody's diary.

01:12:45.562 --> 01:12:49.397
We are on the right track.

01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:54.869
Remember, what we did in
Tasmania.
- Yes.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.904
Let's do that again.

01:13:09.552 --> 01:13:11.569
Avi.

01:13:11.570 --> 01:13:13.587
How can I know what
happened in Tasmania?

01:13:22.132 --> 01:13:24.699
(Screaming)

01:13:24.701 --> 01:13:28.703
A big bee.
Is that what happened in
Tasmania?

01:13:28.838 --> 01:13:30.138
Robu!

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:38.846
It's amazing what you can make..

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:41.849
..when you have nothing but
time.

01:13:44.821 --> 01:13:46.454
(Screaming)

01:14:09.913 --> 01:14:11.512
(Sighs)

01:14:11.848 --> 01:14:14.549
I am feeling sleepy.

01:14:17.153 --> 01:14:19.787
What? Shonku!
- Dad.

01:14:19.789 --> 01:14:23.791
Luigi! Thomasina.
To the ship. We are leaving.

01:14:30.033 --> 01:14:31.132
(Sighing)

01:14:31.134 --> 01:14:36.737
Professor Shonku.
Always so nice to see you.

01:14:37.607 --> 01:14:38.873
Kill him.

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:41.909
Dad.

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:43.678
Melody! Mo!

01:14:43.680 --> 01:14:47.148
Willard, you want to
stop me from getting rich.

01:14:47.150 --> 01:14:48.916
Rich.

01:14:49.052 --> 01:14:50.685
Professor.

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:55.122
(Groaning)

01:14:55.558 --> 01:14:56.824
No!

01:14:56.826 --> 01:14:58.059
No!

01:14:58.061 --> 01:14:59.494
Dad!

01:15:01.064 --> 01:15:02.063
Dad!

01:15:02.065 --> 01:15:04.165
(Crying)

01:15:04.167 --> 01:15:07.068
(Groaning)

01:15:07.537 --> 01:15:09.770
I have never been shot before.

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.707
(Laughing)

01:15:15.211 --> 01:15:16.210
(Shocked)

01:15:17.547 --> 01:15:20.515
Out of darts. I hate that.

01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:22.016
I don't.

01:15:22.519 --> 01:15:23.851
(Laughing)

01:15:27.690 --> 01:15:29.590
What? Ouch.

01:15:30.093 --> 01:15:31.959
Let me leave, Shonku.

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:34.061
And you can have the brats.

01:15:34.063 --> 01:15:37.732
Otherwise over the edge with
them.

01:15:38.101 --> 01:15:39.667
Boohoo.

01:15:39.669 --> 01:15:43.671
Ouch. I am healing.
The tissue is growing.

01:15:43.673 --> 01:15:47.675
My wound is mending.
Is this a great place or what?

01:15:47.677 --> 01:15:49.010
Charlie.

01:15:51.014 --> 01:15:55.550
Fantastic. The secret of
immortality.

01:15:55.919 --> 01:16:00.321
I think Willard is the
true prize in this place.

01:16:02.258 --> 01:16:04.725
Get my new friend into the
airship.

01:16:05.228 --> 01:16:09.897
Once again Shonku,
you find interesting things.

01:16:09.899 --> 01:16:12.099
I take them from you.

01:16:12.302 --> 01:16:15.170
Take them where.

01:16:15.171 --> 01:16:18.039
Once you pass the dream wall
everything you have will cease
to exist.

01:16:18.274 --> 01:16:21.642
It will be gone like
yesterday's dinosaur.

01:16:23.112 --> 01:16:27.615
Shonku, you are still not a good
liar.

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:29.884
You are right. You are right.

01:16:29.886 --> 01:16:32.253
Once again you have defeated..

01:16:32.255 --> 01:16:35.156
..the mighty intellect
of Professor Shonku.

01:16:35.758 --> 01:16:37.825
Oh the shame of it.

01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:40.027
Except for one little thing.

01:16:40.029 --> 01:16:41.729
And that would be?

01:16:41.731 --> 01:16:44.865
Sure, you can have Willard. Take
him.

01:16:45.201 --> 01:16:48.102
But how long will it take
you to uncover the secrets of..

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:51.105
..immortality contained in his
body.

01:16:51.307 --> 01:16:53.841
Months. Years. Maybe.

01:16:54.077 --> 01:16:58.312
But I wrote it all
down in my new diary.

01:16:58.314 --> 01:17:00.781
Not your diary professor.

01:17:01.784 --> 01:17:04.302
No.

01:17:04.303 --> 01:17:06.821
Another Shonku's diaries
with the secret of immortality.

01:17:06.823 --> 01:17:11.892
The diary is too powerful.
He could rule the world forever.

01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:15.930
I could be wealthy. Wealthy.
Wealthy.

01:17:15.932 --> 01:17:17.398
That's three of these.

01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:21.202
Then release my friends
and you can have the diary.

01:17:21.204 --> 01:17:23.037
Easy-peasy.

01:17:25.008 --> 01:17:27.308
Talk it over with that.

01:17:39.856 --> 01:17:40.888
Professor.

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:44.258
I am all right.

01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:47.128
And by that I mean nothing's
broken.

01:17:51.968 --> 01:17:53.668
Let's go. Go. Go.

01:17:54.103 --> 01:17:56.303
Right foot first.
- No left.

01:17:56.439 --> 01:17:58.339
Listen, I got it.

01:17:58.341 --> 01:18:00.841
(Screaming)

01:18:00.843 --> 01:18:03.144
Shonku. Help them.

01:18:03.146 --> 01:18:04.979
Farewell, Shonku.

01:18:04.981 --> 01:18:08.282
I believe the score is now,
me a winner.

01:18:08.284 --> 01:18:10.151
You, a loser.

01:18:10.153 --> 01:18:12.720
(Laughing)

01:18:14.724 --> 01:18:16.190
But I have got a plan.

01:18:16.192 --> 01:18:17.058
(Whistle)

01:18:29.706 --> 01:18:33.007
Get me out of here.
Now. I have got money to earn.

01:18:33.009 --> 01:18:34.875
(Laughing)

01:18:35.311 --> 01:18:40.948
Day 1, Mo and I are on
our way to see professor Shonku.

01:18:41.284 --> 01:18:43.017
Wait. What?

01:18:43.019 --> 01:18:44.719
(Laughing)

01:18:44.721 --> 01:18:46.987
That's my daughter's diary.

01:18:46.989 --> 01:18:50.825
Looks like Shonku got the
best of you this time,
Franzotti.

01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:54.128
Turn the ship around.
We are going back.

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:55.196
(Surprised)

01:18:56.966 --> 01:18:59.033
I have got to go shoot somebody.

01:19:05.875 --> 01:19:08.209
Let's go this way, bird.

01:19:10.847 --> 01:19:13.314
Melody! You and Mo hang on.

01:19:13.316 --> 01:19:15.449
You will be safe in a second.

01:19:32.802 --> 01:19:35.803
Enjoying Franzotti's
hospitality, I see.

01:19:36.205 --> 01:19:39.140
It is better than
that hotel in Shanghai.

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:42.143
Not as good as that
camp ground at Ibisis.

01:19:42.378 --> 01:19:44.178
What about Melody and Mo?

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:46.947
They will be fine.
Robu is handling it.

01:19:51.888 --> 01:19:55.055
Now this is something
I am very good at doing.

01:19:55.057 --> 01:19:57.992
When I saw go, sir you bow.

01:19:59.529 --> 01:20:01.228
(Screaming)

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:02.997
Now Mr. Avi.

01:20:08.304 --> 01:20:09.537
Locked in

01:20:13.009 --> 01:20:15.843
(Screaming)

01:20:17.079 --> 01:20:18.245
Wow.

01:20:23.052 --> 01:20:24.552
This is great.

01:20:26.956 --> 01:20:29.089
Time to go, old friend.

01:20:29.826 --> 01:20:31.826
Not without my new friend.

01:20:38.501 --> 01:20:42.603
Unbelievable.
You found a real unicorn.

01:20:42.605 --> 01:20:44.605
I accept your apology.

01:20:44.607 --> 01:20:47.975
Shonku, you have the perfect
timing.

01:20:47.977 --> 01:20:50.878
You see I wanted to
punch you into the face.

01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:55.549
And here you are,
so go punch him in the face.

01:20:55.551 --> 01:20:57.551
You got it, Mr. Franzotti.

01:20:57.553 --> 01:20:59.353
Come along, honey.

01:20:59.355 --> 01:21:02.389
I am going to punch you in the
face.

01:21:02.391 --> 01:21:03.424
(Laughing)

01:21:03.426 --> 01:21:04.992
Did you bring any guns?

01:21:04.994 --> 01:21:07.027
Where do you think I would keep
them?

01:21:07.029 --> 01:21:09.063
Right?

01:21:09.064 --> 01:21:11.098
We will have to do this
the old fashioned way then.

01:21:11.100 --> 01:21:14.101
It will be an honor
to punch him in the face.

01:21:14.337 --> 01:21:16.403
Give it all you've got,
hoodlums.

01:21:20.610 --> 01:21:22.309
(Laughing)

01:21:44.667 --> 01:21:47.668
I have to return this. Let's go.

01:21:52.008 --> 01:21:53.641
Not without my unicorn.

01:21:55.011 --> 01:21:56.243
(Whistles)

01:21:58.547 --> 01:22:01.382
I hope you're right behind me,
Shonku.

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:13.160
I will see you again,
until we meet again, Franzotti.

01:22:13.296 --> 01:22:15.996
I hope you are right
in front of me, Willard.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.240
(Screaming)

01:22:30.413 --> 01:22:32.279
What was that about?

01:22:32.281 --> 01:22:34.281
We discovered that
the bird doesn't respond..

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:36.317
..favorably to high
pitched frequencies.

01:22:36.652 --> 01:22:39.553
I imagine that has annoyed
him more than we have.

01:22:40.656 --> 01:22:45.059
Got you. Now who will get me?
Shonku.

01:22:45.061 --> 01:22:47.194
Almost. Got you.

01:22:50.599 --> 01:22:52.333
I think it is purring.

01:22:56.372 --> 01:22:57.671
The unicorn.

01:23:01.010 --> 01:23:04.111
Avinash Chatterjee.
This is your big moment.

01:23:04.380 --> 01:23:06.347
How many in your family can ever
say..

01:23:06.349 --> 01:23:08.282
..that they have caught
a falling unicorn?

01:23:08.284 --> 01:23:09.383
None but me.

01:23:09.585 --> 01:23:12.319
I hope. A little bit more, Mr.
Avi.

01:23:12.588 --> 01:23:15.489
Little bit. Perfect.

01:23:21.364 --> 01:23:22.463
(Laughing)

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:28.602
I will return with an
army and destroy, destroy.

01:23:28.604 --> 01:23:31.005
Destroy this place.

01:23:31.007 --> 01:23:32.706
That's three destroys.

01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:35.743
Get me out of here.

01:23:39.482 --> 01:23:42.016
Dad! Dad!

01:23:45.121 --> 01:23:48.389
Now this is truly a garden of
dreams.

01:23:48.657 --> 01:23:52.059
I knew you were alive. I just
knew it.

01:23:52.061 --> 01:23:55.129
People tried to tell me no.
But I wouldn't listen.

01:23:58.501 --> 01:24:01.201
Can we just hug you for a long
time?

01:24:01.437 --> 01:24:04.271
Franzotti got away again.

01:24:04.273 --> 01:24:05.806
He got away with nothing.

01:24:05.808 --> 01:24:07.808
And he won't find his way back.

01:24:07.810 --> 01:24:09.743
Can we go home now?

01:24:12.782 --> 01:24:15.049
I made it. Yes.

01:24:15.484 --> 01:24:17.718
I may not be wealthy, wealthy.

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:20.487
But I will be wealthy.

01:24:20.689 --> 01:24:24.358
Just one of these creatures
is worth a fortune.

01:24:45.548 --> 01:24:48.082
Shonku!

01:25:24.887 --> 01:25:28.255
But when can you come home?

01:25:28.491 --> 01:25:31.458
If you are not going, I am not
going.

01:25:31.794 --> 01:25:35.229
But I am counting on you.
Both of you and Shonku.

01:25:35.498 --> 01:25:36.830
The professor needs help.

01:25:37.233 --> 01:25:39.833
One of you will find
a cure and bring me home.

01:25:40.202 --> 01:25:42.536
I like it here.

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:44.871
But I want to be with my
family on the next great
adventure.

01:25:45.474 --> 01:25:47.875
Where did all these
creatures come from?

01:25:47.877 --> 01:25:50.244
Legend has it that
the unicorn has created..

01:25:50.246 --> 01:25:52.379
..by the power of positive
thinking.

01:25:52.381 --> 01:25:56.783
So you can just think
unicorn and one pops out.

01:25:57.186 --> 01:26:00.354
Sort of. Negative thoughts,
you get a minotaur.

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:03.924
Good thoughts, unicorn. So be
good.

01:26:03.926 --> 01:26:06.627
I am thinking of a good curry,
back home..

01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:08.495
..were the good curries are.

01:26:08.864 --> 01:26:10.931
We are going to home.

01:26:14.503 --> 01:26:17.337
Good bye Mo. Good bye Melody.

01:26:17.540 --> 01:26:19.873
I know we will see
each other very soon.

01:26:19.875 --> 01:26:23.310
Good luck professor.
I am counting on you.

01:26:23.479 --> 01:26:27.347
We will be back, Willard
to take you out of here safely.

01:26:27.583 --> 01:26:30.450
I know that to be true, my
friend.

01:26:30.452 --> 01:26:31.585
Goodbye, Willard.
- Goodbye, dad.

01:26:31.587 --> 01:26:33.253
Bye. Bye.
- Love you.

01:26:34.657 --> 01:26:36.290
I have a question.

01:26:36.492 --> 01:26:37.958
How are we going to get back
home?

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.794
I believe, I can answer that.

01:26:41.363 --> 01:26:44.331
During the unpleasantness
I took the liberty of..

01:26:44.333 --> 01:26:46.300
..procuring some
transportation..

01:26:46.302 --> 01:26:48.302
..from Mr. Franzotti's airship.

01:26:48.437 --> 01:26:50.237
I am sure, he won't mind.

01:26:50.372 --> 01:26:53.307
Of course,
it might be a little crowded.

01:26:54.543 --> 01:26:56.877
Farewell, Mr. Willard.
- See you later, dad.

01:26:57.213 --> 01:26:58.312
Bye.

01:26:59.281 --> 01:27:00.747
Have a good trip.

01:27:17.466 --> 01:27:19.967
How is it going, Melody?
- Good.

01:27:20.569 --> 01:27:24.938
Add 6 milliliters of
sodium chloride. Got it.

01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:28.242
My senses indicate
this batch might be done.

01:27:28.844 --> 01:27:31.945
The new storage containers
are here professor.

01:27:31.947 --> 01:27:36.016
Also I brought Hydrophonic
tomatoes from my garden.

01:27:37.453 --> 01:27:41.555
Professor, your homemade fly
monkeys.
Brilliant.

01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:48.729
(Groaning)

01:27:50.866 --> 01:27:54.001
Of course,
I still have to work on the
steering.

01:27:54.003 --> 01:27:56.770
(Laughing)

01:27:58.574 --> 01:28:02.009
With a little luck and
a lot of help from you two..

01:28:02.011 --> 01:28:06.780
..I believe that we can bring
your father home very shortly.
