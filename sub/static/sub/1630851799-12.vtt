00:17.649 --> 00:20.859
- Whoo!

00:17.649 --> 00:20.859
- Garcelle?

00:20.120 --> 00:21.687
She didn't wanna stay

00:20.120 --> 00:21.687
at the house because of COVID,

00:21.721 --> 00:23.890
or maybe it's someone,

00:21.721 --> 00:23.890
who knows?

00:23.922 --> 00:26.658
- I am still in the process

00:23.922 --> 00:26.658
of repairing

00:26.693 --> 00:28.940
<i>my relationship with Garcelle</i>

00:28.128 --> 00:30.300
because we aren't

00:28.128 --> 00:30.300
where we used to be.

00:30.629 --> 00:32.649
- Do we know how it went

00:30.629 --> 00:32.649
with Tom today?

00:32.979 --> 00:34.634
- The government froze

00:32.979 --> 00:34.634
all of his assets.

00:34.667 --> 00:36.902
- Remember, he had that

00:34.667 --> 00:36.902
car accident a few years ago.

00:36.936 --> 00:38.470
He crashed into a wall,

00:36.936 --> 00:38.470
or what did he crash into?

00:38.505 --> 00:41.274
- He drove off a cliff.

00:38.505 --> 00:41.274
- Oh, what?

00:41.307 --> 00:44.610
- There was a significant shift

00:41.307 --> 00:44.610
in his decision making

00:44.643 --> 00:46.311
in those years.

00:47.746 --> 00:49.215
- He does?

00:49.249 --> 00:51.317
- If you don't mind me saying,

00:49.249 --> 00:51.317
Tom calls her.

00:52.118 --> 00:54.286
- Well, I do mind you

00:52.118 --> 00:54.286
saying that, 'cause I feel

00:54.320 --> 00:56.289
like you're betraying

00:54.320 --> 00:56.289
my friendship right now.

00:56.322 --> 00:57.923
But please, have your moment.

00:57.957 --> 00:59.359
- Erika.

00:59.392 --> 01:02.462
- Sometimes not everything

00:59.392 --> 01:02.462
is up for discussion.

01:02.494 --> 01:04.531
So I think that was dirty.

01:06.432 --> 01:08.335
I just want to go

01:06.432 --> 01:08.335
to the bathroom

01:08.367 --> 01:10.503
for a... [hiccups] minute.

01:10.537 --> 01:12.438

01:12.471 --> 01:14.340
unless something else

01:12.471 --> 01:14.340
is happening.

01:14.974 --> 01:15.942
- If someone says, you know,

01:15.974 --> 01:18.780
"Listen, I-I don't want

01:15.974 --> 01:18.780
to talk about it"--

01:18.111 --> 01:20.313
- Well, you're making it like

01:18.111 --> 01:20.313
I did this intentionally.

01:20.347 --> 01:21.313
- You did not hear.

01:20.347 --> 01:21.313
I know that.

01:21.347 --> 01:23.682
I knew Erika didn't want

01:21.347 --> 01:23.682
to talk about this.

01:23.716 --> 01:25.849
<i>This is a misunderstanding.</i>

01:25.617 --> 01:27.287

<i>- I would never want</i>

01:37.831 --> 01:39.531
<i>to hurt her.</i>

01:39.566 --> 01:41.301
She's already

01:39.566 --> 01:41.301
going through a lot.

01:41.334 --> 01:42.368
I would never want to do that,

01:42.402 --> 01:44.403
but I never got told not to.

01:44.436 --> 01:45.972
I didn't know.

01:46.599 --> 01:47.340
- No, I get it.

01:46.599 --> 01:47.340
You weren't actually there.

01:47.373 --> 01:48.741
I was there.

01:47.373 --> 01:48.741
You had already got in the car

01:48.775 --> 01:50.509
when she said

01:48.775 --> 01:50.509
didn't want to talk about it.

01:50.543 --> 01:52.746
So I would never bring it up,

01:50.543 --> 01:52.746
but you didn't hear that.

01:52.778 --> 01:54.347
If you were there with her,

01:54.381 --> 01:56.216
I know you would have been

01:54.381 --> 01:56.216
like me and not said anything.

01:56.248 --> 01:57.283
- No.

01:57.317 --> 02:02.549
- I don't even know

01:57.317 --> 02:02.549
why if Tom had called Erika

02:02.549 --> 02:05.579
would be that big of a deal.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.235
- Obviously, if you've been

02:14.167 --> 02:16.235
married all of these years,

02:16.269 --> 02:17.836
<i>your husband's</i>

02:16.269 --> 02:17.836

02:17.871 --> 02:19.506
- Do you want any more

02:17.871 --> 02:19.506
of these?

02:19.538 --> 02:21.675
- Just take that.

02:19.538 --> 02:21.675
- Okay.

02:32.585 --> 02:34.586
- You know, this is very hard.

02:40.826 --> 02:45.198
This is a hard time in my life.

02:58.110 --> 03:00.413
- Just breathe.

03:06.819 --> 03:10.423
- I'm leaving.

03:06.819 --> 03:10.423
I'm going.

03:10.456 --> 03:11.858
I'm going back to [inaudible].

03:16.329 --> 03:18.631
<i>- This really pisses me off</i>

03:16.329 --> 03:18.631
<i>because I don't think</i>

03:18.664 --> 03:20.533
Rinna's giving me

03:18.664 --> 03:20.533
the benefit of the doubt.

03:25.938 --> 03:27.173
She shared a lot.

03:27.206 --> 03:30.776
She's supposed to be building

03:27.206 --> 03:30.776
a relationship with me, right?

03:33.712 --> 03:35.882
- Look at her.

03:35.914 --> 03:38.585
I don't want to add to her...

03:43.355 --> 03:44.524
- You're important to me.

03:44.557 --> 03:45.759
- I know.

03:44.557 --> 03:45.759
It's okay.

03:45.792 --> 03:49.361
- And I'm not--it's not

03:45.792 --> 03:49.361
worth it for me, for anything,

03:49.396 --> 03:50.829
for you to think

03:50.864 --> 03:52.831
that I was doing this

03:50.864 --> 03:52.831
intentionally.

03:52.865 --> 03:54.834
You shared so much.

03:54.867 --> 03:56.536
- It's okay.

03:58.271 --> 03:59.472
- Oh, (BLEEP).

03:59.506 --> 04:00.939
- It's okay.

03:59.506 --> 04:00.939
You don't need to leave.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.376
It's okay.

04:01.409 --> 04:03.376

I would not want to hurt you.

04:47.420 --> 04:48.855
I would not want

05:25.824 --> 05:26.893
So--

- But she wasn't there.

08:32.711 --> 08:35.715
- Are you sure that that's what

08:32.711 --> 08:35.715
she was upset about?

08:36.883 --> 08:38.817
- I mean, she's upset

08:36.883 --> 08:38.817
about a lot of things.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.653
Like, it just comes out.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.653
I get it.

08:41.687 --> 08:42.855
- I'm just gonna get

08:41.687 --> 08:42.855
some cheese

08:42.889 --> 08:44.570
while we're talking.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.570
Sorry.

08:44.570 --> 08:45.158
- No, it's okay.

08:45.191 --> 08:46.793
- So let's go back

08:45.191 --> 08:46.793
and let's get ready.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.528
- Yeah.

08:46.826 --> 08:48.528
- Because 7:00 is dinner.

08:48.561 --> 08:50.163
- Let's say 7:00, guys.

08:50.196 --> 08:51.530
- Bye!

08:50.196 --> 08:51.530
See you at 7:00.

08:51.563 --> 08:52.899
- Bye.

08:52.932 --> 08:55.567
- I was literally,

08:52.932 --> 08:55.567
like, stress eating during it.

08:55.601 --> 08:57.903
I was like,

08:55.601 --> 08:57.903
"My taco, my popcorn."

08:57.937 --> 09:00.399
Oh, my God.

09:00.730 --> 09:01.341
- It's unfortunate.

09:01.374 --> 09:05.745
But I feel like, you know, not

09:01.374 --> 09:05.745
a lot of people are on my side.

09:05.778 --> 09:07.799
- I mean, sides is weird

09:07.113 --> 09:08.615
because it shouldn't--it's not

09:07.113 --> 09:08.615
you and her side.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.115
- But that's how it is, though.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.115
That's how it is.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.851
- And that's bullsh--.

09:10.149 --> 09:12.851
- That's why they were here,

09:12.885 --> 09:14.653
and we were in there.

09:14.687 --> 09:16.155
I think ever since I started

09:14.687 --> 09:16.155
hanging out with this group,

09:16.188 --> 09:19.590
I felt like there was

09:16.188 --> 09:19.590
an inner circle to our group.

09:19.919 --> 09:21.940
<i>It's just my feeling</i>

09:19.919 --> 09:21.940
<i>that I can't shake,</i>

09:21.126 --> 09:24.639
and I think I'm not being made

09:21.126 --> 09:24.639
to feel differently, either.

09:24.970 --> 09:26.599
- I don't think it's our job

09:24.970 --> 09:26.599
to ask her questions

09:26.633 --> 09:28.600
unless she wants to share it.

09:28.634 --> 09:30.470
If you've already been

09:28.634 --> 09:30.470
asking questions...

09:30.503 --> 09:31.770
- Are you gonna have

09:30.503 --> 09:31.770
to go to court?

09:31.804 --> 09:34.399
- I don't know.

09:31.804 --> 09:34.399
Every day is different.

09:34.399 --> 09:37.811
- Was he in the hospital?

09:34.399 --> 09:37.811
- Not to my knowledge.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.460
- And you had no idea.

09:40.212 --> 09:41.780
- No.

09:40.212 --> 09:41.780
- Wow.

09:41.815 --> 09:44.717
- You don't need to ask

09:41.815 --> 09:44.717
any more questions maybe.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.519
- She was expressing so much.

09:46.519 --> 09:47.821
It was because

09:46.519 --> 09:47.821
she feels safe with us.

09:47.854 --> 09:48.922
- We were just talking about it

09:48.955 --> 09:50.590
in the kitchen

09:48.955 --> 09:50.590
before we sat down.

09:50.623 --> 09:51.691
- She's like, "Hang on."

09:51.725 --> 09:52.725
- Well, she's seen

09:51.725 --> 09:52.725
what's happening.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.793
- She was waiting--

09:53.826 --> 09:54.894
- She said

09:53.826 --> 09:54.894
something new came out.

09:54.927 --> 09:58.664
- I'm waiting

09:54.927 --> 09:58.664
for the transcript

09:58.697 --> 10:00.659
for the hearing today.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.100
- Was there a hearing today?

10:01.134 --> 10:02.601
- But yeah, it's not good.

10:02.634 --> 10:05.638
It's another great day

10:02.634 --> 10:05.638
in paradise for me.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.907
- An involuntary bankruptcy

10:05.672 --> 10:07.907
petition is being filed.

10:07.941 --> 10:09.142
<i>What does that mean?</i>

10:09.174 --> 10:10.909
<i>- Involuntary.</i>

10:09.174 --> 10:10.909
<i>- What does that mean?</i>

10:10.943 --> 10:14.880
- In the event of a divorce,

10:10.943 --> 10:14.880
she would expect to get 50%.

10:14.913 --> 10:16.615
If he is now--

10:16.649 --> 10:20.220
everything that they have

10:16.649 --> 10:20.220
is going into the bankruptcy,

10:20.253 --> 10:22.121
Ericka cannot get a dime.

10:22.154 --> 10:24.724
Tom is one

10:22.154 --> 10:24.724
of the wealthiest lawyers

10:24.758 --> 10:26.393
I've ever heard of.

10:26.426 --> 10:28.961
<i>I mean, this man traveled</i>

10:26.426 --> 10:28.961
<i>on private planes,</i>

10:28.995 --> 10:34.669
lived in a mansion,

10:28.995 --> 10:34.669
and now, it's gone.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.403
- Listen, let's think about--

10:34.100 --> 10:36.403
what are we having for dinner?

10:36.436 --> 10:37.836
- You know what looks

10:36.436 --> 10:37.836
really good?

10:37.870 --> 10:39.500
- What?

10:39.389 --> 10:40.874
Come on and tell us.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.874
- Is Ruth's Chris.

10:40.907 --> 10:43.429
They have

10:40.907 --> 10:43.429
the sweet potato casserole.

10:43.759 --> 10:44.677
They had

10:43.759 --> 10:44.677
the lobster mac and cheese,

10:44.711 --> 10:47.246
the baked potato, the spinach.

10:44.711 --> 10:47.246
They have fish.

10:47.279 --> 10:48.782
- I'm allergic to lobster.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.649
- They have--what do you

10:48.815 --> 10:50.649
feel like?

10:50.683 --> 10:52.818
- I will--

10:50.683 --> 10:52.818
I-I honestly--what's happening?

10:52.851 --> 10:54.421
- Get whatever.

10:54.453 --> 10:57.222
- I will set the table

10:54.453 --> 10:57.222
so you can relax.

10:57.256 --> 10:58.357
- They have seared ahi tuna,

10:58.390 --> 11:02.696
they have barbecued shrimp,

10:58.390 --> 11:02.696
or they have crab cake.

11:02.729 --> 11:04.630
- I'm going to get dressed.

11:05.932 --> 11:08.902
<i>[electronic music]</i>

11:10.235 --> 11:11.870

11:13.730 --> 11:14.441
- This is what I got today.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.208
- Working, Ri--

11:14.474 --> 11:16.208
I love your outfit.

11:16.241 --> 11:17.309
- Thank you.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.789
- This is gorgeous.

11:17.344 --> 11:19.789
I'm coveting.

11:19.789 --> 11:21.447
- I'm gonna do

11:19.789 --> 11:21.447
a dangle earring, or no?

11:21.480 --> 11:23.149
- No, I think that's adorable,

11:23.182 --> 11:25.850
but the necklace

11:23.182 --> 11:25.850
looks a little daytime.

11:37.996 --> 11:40.100

11:37.996 --> 11:40.100
I don't want--

Ice.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.302
- Ice?

11:41.768 --> 11:43.302
Okay, hold on.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.105
- Hi, Kathy.

11:43.336 --> 11:45.105
- Hi, darling.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.740
- How are you?

11:45.138 --> 11:46.740
- Good.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.274
- Why is it not going--

11:49.308 --> 11:51.110
why is it going everywhere

11:49.308 --> 11:51.110
except the glass?

11:51.110 --> 11:54.980
- I mean--

11:51.110 --> 11:54.980
- Oh, gorgeous!

11:55.149 --> 11:57.683
- Good evening.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.683
- Wow, that's Gucci.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.285
Wow, Dorit.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.285
That's amazing.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.549
- Beautiful.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.549
- Wait a minute.

12:02.549 --> 12:06.225
You're gonna waste this outfit

12:02.549 --> 12:06.225
with us girls just here?

12:06.259 --> 12:12.649
- Look, naughty Santa's helper,

12:06.259 --> 12:12.649
sweet Santa's helper.

12:12.980 --> 12:16.101
Dorit.

12:12.980 --> 12:16.101
Oh, I just, I love her so much.

12:16.135 --> 12:18.937

12:18.971 --> 12:21.674

12:25.177 --> 12:28.347
- Oh, my God.

12:25.177 --> 12:28.347
What is my problem?

12:30.250 --> 12:31.717
- Cheers.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.352
- Is that real? It's real.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.352
Isn't it?

12:33.385 --> 12:34.888
- What do you mean?

12:33.385 --> 12:34.888
Of course, it's real.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.623
It's vintage Cartier.

12:40.929 --> 12:41.394
- No.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.730
- What?

12:43.763 --> 12:46.990
You're so ----ing rich.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.990
I forget.

12:46.990 --> 12:48.335
- Should we sit?

12:46.990 --> 12:48.335
- Yeah, we should sit.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.437
- They're like

12:48.368 --> 12:50.437

12:50.470 --> 12:54.341
- There they are.

12:50.470 --> 12:54.341

12:54.374 --> 12:55.875

12:54.374 --> 12:55.875
You guys look great.

12:55.908 --> 12:57.110
- Thank you.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.977
- Look how great we all look.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.977
- I know.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.214
- I'm just gonna say it.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.214
- Hi.

- Oh, that's a gorgeous blouse.

13:03.490 --> 13:05.118
- Thank you.

such a great hostess.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.688
- Oh, thank you.

13:07.153 --> 13:09.688
I mean, trying.

13:09.722 --> 13:11.791

- Sorry.

- What was that?

13:14.326 --> 13:15.562
- Stop!

13:15.595 --> 13:16.962
- Scared the living daylights

13:15.595 --> 13:16.962
out of me.

13:17.629 --> 13:19.966
- Who was that?

13:20.659 --> 13:21.669
- That was Kathy!

13:21.100 --> 13:24.403
- I'm just burring.

13:21.100 --> 13:24.403
I'm cold.

13:24.437 --> 13:26.840
- Guys, has anyone spoken

13:24.437 --> 13:26.840
to Erika?

13:26.873 --> 13:27.841
- I texted with her.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.759
- Oh, good.

13:27.874 --> 13:30.759
Just so she knows that people--

13:30.759 --> 13:31.344
- I texted her.

13:30.759 --> 13:31.344
- You know?

13:31.378 --> 13:33.789
- I sent her a text.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.789
- You know?

13:33.789 --> 13:34.713
- Of course.

13:33.789 --> 13:34.713
- You sent her a text?

13:34.748 --> 13:35.849
- Of course.

13:35.881 --> 13:37.830
- And? Did she respond?

13:37.830 --> 13:38.384
- No, I didn't expect

13:37.830 --> 13:38.384
a response.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.860
I was just like,

13:38.418 --> 13:40.860
"I'm so sorry."

13:40.120 --> 13:42.154
Does it bother me

13:40.120 --> 13:42.154
that Erika got upset?

13:42.187 --> 13:43.222
Absolutely.

13:43.255 --> 13:45.991
But I know

13:43.255 --> 13:45.991
where I was coming from.

13:46.919 --> 13:47.860
<i>I wasn't trying</i>

13:46.919 --> 13:47.860
<i>to get at Erika.</i>

13:47.894 --> 13:49.461
So my conscience is clear.

13:49.495 --> 13:52.231
- The next time she sees you,

13:49.495 --> 13:52.231
she's not gonna be a bitch.

13:52.264 --> 13:55.100
She's not gonna be,

13:52.264 --> 13:55.100
you know, screaming at you.

13:55.134 --> 13:57.236
She's just not gonna trust you.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.371
- Okay, I get that.

13:57.269 --> 13:59.371
- In my head--

13:59.405 --> 14:02.307
- I get that, but I did not

13:59.405 --> 14:02.307
do it intentionally.

14:02.341 --> 14:04.309
- Is there anything

14:02.341 --> 14:04.309
that you can own in it?

14:04.344 --> 14:05.778
- Excuse me?

14:05.812 --> 14:09.149
- Garcelle needs

14:05.812 --> 14:09.149
to check herself

14:09.182 --> 14:11.250
as to why

14:09.182 --> 14:11.250
she does what she does.

14:11.283 --> 14:14.620
Garcelle throws a little darts,

14:11.283 --> 14:14.620
and people are like, "Ow."

14:14.653 --> 14:16.255
- Every time somebody

14:14.653 --> 14:16.255
brought up

14:16.288 --> 14:18.357
Erika's Broadway debut,

14:18.390 --> 14:21.860
Lisa chimed in, like,

14:18.390 --> 14:21.860
"I did it 18 years ago."

14:21.894 --> 14:24.730
Do you think that

14:21.894 --> 14:24.730
your body image

14:24.764 --> 14:26.432
affected your daughter

14:24.764 --> 14:26.432
in any way?

14:26.466 --> 14:29.903
Dancing? Barely naked?

14:29.936 --> 14:32.272
- This is not somebody

14:29.936 --> 14:32.272
that has your back.

14:32.304 --> 14:34.139
And that's what I'm trying

14:32.304 --> 14:34.139
to get Garcelle

14:34.173 --> 14:35.408
to just take a peek at.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.643
- Is there any part of it

14:36.676 --> 14:39.278
that you--

14:36.676 --> 14:39.278
that you can own in it?

14:39.312 --> 14:41.947
- Absolutely not.

14:42.182 --> 14:44.384
Maybe Rinna feels like

14:42.182 --> 14:44.384
I asked too many questions,

14:44.417 --> 14:47.519
but, you know, seeing

14:44.417 --> 14:47.519
the way she treated Denise,

14:47.553 --> 14:49.355
I think that's

14:47.553 --> 14:49.355
a little bit hypocritical.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.290
- Denise, have you said things

14:49.389 --> 14:51.290
about me

14:51.323 --> 14:52.392
to other people

14:51.323 --> 14:52.392
that are negative?

14:52.424 --> 14:53.893
- I have not.

14:53.927 --> 14:56.960
- Did you say anything

14:53.927 --> 14:56.960
about Erika?

14:56.960 --> 14:57.330
- No, I didn't.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.798
- Someone's not being honest.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.567
- She can take her "own this"

15:01.600 --> 15:03.669
and shove it,

15:01.600 --> 15:03.669
as far as I'm concerned.

15:03.702 --> 15:04.937
- I don't think

15:03.702 --> 15:04.937
you were looking

15:05.379 --> 15:06.339
to kick her when she's down.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.409
I don't think

15:06.373 --> 15:08.409
you were trying to hurt her.

15:08.740 --> 15:09.875
Maybe, needling a little bit.

15:09.908 --> 15:13.278
- I would not do that to her.

15:09.908 --> 15:13.278
I am not going to sh-- on her

15:13.312 --> 15:15.480
when she's at her bottom.

15:15.809 --> 15:18.509
That's not who I am.

15:15.809 --> 15:18.509
I'm just not that person.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.120
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

15:22.121 --> 15:24.899
<i>- Coming up...</i>

15:24.124 --> 15:25.924
- What kind of game

15:24.124 --> 15:25.924
do you want to play?

15:25.958 --> 15:27.394
- I think a happy one.

15:25.958 --> 15:27.394
- Wait.

15:27.427 --> 15:30.263
Was--is there any situation

15:27.427 --> 15:30.263
you would say a sad one?

15:37.437 --> 15:38.672
<i>- I am not going</i>

15:37.437 --> 15:38.672
<i>to sh-- on her</i>

15:39.205 --> 15:40.940
when she's at her bottom.

15:40.974 --> 15:44.769
That's not who I am.

15:40.974 --> 15:44.769
I'm just not that person.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.647
- I was there. She--

15:45.544 --> 15:47.647
- I'm telling you.

15:47.681 --> 15:49.182
- When she didn't want it

15:47.681 --> 15:49.182
to come out,

15:49.215 --> 15:50.383
Garcelle was not there.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.850
- You don't even have

15:50.417 --> 15:52.850
to defend me.

15:52.850 --> 15:53.519
I know who I am.

15:52.850 --> 15:53.519
- I know.

15:53.552 --> 15:55.187
- It could happen

15:53.552 --> 15:55.187
to any one of us.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.899
I'm not taking that on.

15:57.899 --> 15:59.192
Obviously, you feel like

15:57.899 --> 15:59.192
maybe I should.

16:00.929 --> 16:01.461
- Let's get really clear.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.363
Make me understand

16:01.494 --> 16:03.363
what happened.

16:04.299 --> 16:07.366
- I wish I had been told

16:04.299 --> 16:07.366
not to say anything

16:07.399 --> 16:09.350
'cause I wouldn't,

16:07.399 --> 16:09.350
and I wasn't,

16:09.690 --> 16:11.710
and I--and I-I overstepped.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.730
- Okay, that's good.

16:13.105 --> 16:14.139
- I overstepped.

16:14.173 --> 16:15.341
- That's good right there.

16:15.375 --> 16:19.245
- I did not do it deliberately,

16:15.375 --> 16:19.245
so I have nothing to own.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.181
I'm just trying to shut her up.

16:21.213 --> 16:23.917
- Okay, I'm getting

16:21.213 --> 16:23.917
the food ready, guys.

16:24.918 --> 16:28.539
- Help a girl up.

16:24.918 --> 16:28.539
- Jeez, okay.

16:28.879 --> 16:32.919
- Santa came early and brought

16:28.879 --> 16:32.919
dinner from Ruth's Chris.

16:32.125 --> 16:33.293
- We kind of match.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.495
I keep trying to match with

16:33.326 --> 16:35.495
people, and it's impossible.

16:35.528 --> 16:37.970
- I know!

16:35.528 --> 16:37.970
But let me tell you,

16:37.129 --> 16:38.498
last night and tonight:

16:37.129 --> 16:38.498
really good.

16:38.530 --> 16:39.532
- You like this?

16:38.530 --> 16:39.532
- Yeah.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.934
I think it's good.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.934
Yes!

16:41.967 --> 16:45.171
It's not couture--or is it?

16:45.205 --> 16:46.905
- No.

16:46.940 --> 16:48.607
It's ready to wear.

16:50.275 --> 16:51.577
- Sutton, this is yours.

16:51.610 --> 16:53.580
- Is there any more white wine?

16:53.613 --> 16:56.820
- Take a sip.

16:53.613 --> 16:56.820
Take a sip.

16:56.115 --> 16:57.149
- Oh, my God.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.585
- [scatting]

16:58.618 --> 17:00.352
We got to eat, guys.

16:58.618 --> 17:00.352
You need to eat.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.554
- Did we forget to pay

17:00.386 --> 17:02.554
the heating bill?

17:03.456 --> 17:05.258
- It's really, really chilly.

17:05.290 --> 17:07.359
- Should I shut the door?

17:05.290 --> 17:07.359
- Yeah.

17:07.394 --> 17:09.362
- Whoo!

17:07.394 --> 17:09.362
- (BLEEP), man, this group.

17:09.395 --> 17:11.230
Sh--.

17:11.263 --> 17:13.329
- I have a potato somewhere.

17:13.660 --> 17:14.933
- Where is the sweet potato?

17:15.349 --> 17:17.403
- Anything else

17:15.349 --> 17:17.403
while we're behind the bar?

17:17.436 --> 17:18.637
- A glass.

17:18.672 --> 17:20.606
I don't like drinking

17:18.672 --> 17:20.606
out of plastic.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.142
- This is really heavy.

17:22.174 --> 17:23.442
- This is one of the best

17:22.174 --> 17:23.442
burgers I've ever had.

17:23.476 --> 17:25.450
- I'm so happy.

17:25.450 --> 17:27.470
- I feel like

17:25.450 --> 17:27.470
we're missing someone.

17:27.413 --> 17:29.182
- Erika.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.518
- No, somebody else, no?

17:29.214 --> 17:31.518
- Nope.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.286
- I'm way down here at the end

17:31.550 --> 17:33.286
of the table, Kathy.

17:33.318 --> 17:34.520
- Oh, there you are.

17:34.554 --> 17:36.189
- Hey, let's play a game.

17:36.221 --> 17:38.910
<i>- Games always lead</i>

17:36.221 --> 17:38.910
<i>to trouble.</i>

17:38.490 --> 17:40.359
Hello, haven't we learned

17:38.490 --> 17:40.359
our lesson?

17:40.393 --> 17:41.528
- Should we play a game?

17:41.560 --> 17:42.729
- I thought that, Teddi,

17:42.761 --> 17:44.698
you were gonna be

17:42.761 --> 17:44.698
a little boring.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.199
- I'll see you in the car.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.199
- It's like, enough!

17:46.231 --> 17:48.634
Just let me have a break, guys.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.136
- I call a thousand.

17:48.667 --> 17:51.136
- The blue, the blue.

17:51.171 --> 17:52.404
- You don't even know

17:51.171 --> 17:52.404
what you're doing.

17:52.439 --> 17:53.405
Are you stupid?

17:53.440 --> 17:55.508
- I don't know what I'm doing.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.508
- (BLEEP) you.

17:55.541 --> 17:57.644
- Don't ----ing call me stupid.

17:57.676 --> 17:59.645
- Stop it, child, upstairs.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.548
- Don't you ----ing--

17:59.679 --> 18:01.548
oh, wow, really?

18:01.580 --> 18:03.717
- Don't ----ing touch me.

18:01.580 --> 18:03.717
- Don't ----ing do that.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.317
- Don't ----ing touch me.

18:05.352 --> 18:07.220
- What kind of game

18:05.352 --> 18:07.220
do you want to play?

18:07.252 --> 18:08.587
- I think a happy one.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.559
- Wait, was there--is there

18:08.621 --> 18:10.559
any situation

18:10.900 --> 18:11.691
you would say a sad one?

18:11.724 --> 18:12.791
- Oh, we'll get to those games.

18:12.826 --> 18:15.295
- We have no games,

18:12.826 --> 18:15.295
like, for example, last night.

18:15.327 --> 18:17.299
- What would Confucius say?

18:17.630 --> 18:19.465
- Oh, shut up!

18:19.499 --> 18:20.799
- She was related to him.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.501
- Oh, I thought you were

18:20.834 --> 18:22.501
----ing being rude.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.104
- No!

18:24.136 --> 18:27.507
- It was Confucius.

18:24.136 --> 18:27.507
- Oh, my God.

18:27.539 --> 18:29.509
- That's racist.

18:27.539 --> 18:29.509
- That's so racist.

18:29.541 --> 18:30.809
- Don't start that again.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.345
- You guys.

18:30.844 --> 18:32.345
- Oh, my God.

18:32.378 --> 18:33.346
That was so funny

18:32.378 --> 18:33.346
that they thought

18:33.380 --> 18:34.814
that was a racist comment.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.682
- You know, and I heard

18:34.847 --> 18:36.682
that you had an issue

18:36.715 --> 18:39.184
with somebody saying,

18:36.715 --> 18:39.184
"I don't see color."

18:39.219 --> 18:41.587
- Are you one of those people

18:39.219 --> 18:41.587
that you don't see color?

18:41.621 --> 18:44.900
Tell me, you're that girl.

18:41.621 --> 18:44.900
I don't see color.

18:44.124 --> 18:45.224
- Are you serious with me

18:44.124 --> 18:45.224
right now?

18:45.258 --> 18:46.358
- Is that what you're saying?

18:46.393 --> 18:48.228
- You know, Michael Jackson

18:46.393 --> 18:48.228
and I grew up together,

18:48.260 --> 18:51.970
and Michael said to me,

18:48.260 --> 18:51.970
"Kathy, I don't see color."

18:51.131 --> 18:52.632
I said, "Well, either do we."

18:52.664 --> 18:54.299
<i>- Mm-mm.</i>

18:52.664 --> 18:54.299
<i>No, no, no.</i>

18:54.334 --> 18:56.301
I'm at the other end

18:54.334 --> 18:56.301
of the table.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.703
<i>I'm gonna stick</i>

18:56.336 --> 18:57.703
<i>to my cream spinach.</i>

18:57.737 --> 18:59.538
I'm not touching this one.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.207
- I know you can see me

18:59.572 --> 19:01.207
as a woman.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.175
You can see me as a mother.

19:01.240 --> 19:03.175
You can see me as a friend,

19:03.209 --> 19:06.578
but if you don't see color,

19:03.209 --> 19:06.578
then you don't see me.

19:07.212 --> 19:09.516
I think Kathy saying

19:07.212 --> 19:09.516
that she doesn't see color

19:09.548 --> 19:11.750
is her way of saying,

19:09.548 --> 19:11.750
"I love everybody,"

19:11.785 --> 19:14.869
<i>but we've moved on from that,</i>

19:14.119 --> 19:17.123
and now,

19:14.119 --> 19:17.123
I need you to see color.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.920
<i>I'm still a Black woman</i>

19:17.156 --> 19:19.920
<i>at the end of the day.</i>

19:19.125 --> 19:21.461
That shows up

19:19.125 --> 19:21.461
before my intelligence,

19:21.493 --> 19:22.761
before my fashion.

19:22.796 --> 19:25.464
<i>That shows up before anything</i>

19:22.796 --> 19:25.464
<i>when I walk in the room,</i>

19:25.498 --> 19:27.099
and I need you to see that.

19:27.133 --> 19:28.835
- She's saying that everybody,

19:27.133 --> 19:28.835
to her, is equal.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.603
- But we're not.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.603
We're not equal.

19:30.636 --> 19:31.738
- But I think we are.

19:30.636 --> 19:31.738
- Right.

19:31.770 --> 19:33.405
That is

19:31.770 --> 19:33.405
the conversation we had.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.840
- That's the conversation

19:33.440 --> 19:34.840
that we need to have, then.

19:34.874 --> 19:35.741
- Yeah, we're not equal.

19:35.775 --> 19:36.809
- What does that mean?

19:35.775 --> 19:36.809
- Why aren't we?

19:36.843 --> 19:39.746
- Because we are not treated

19:36.843 --> 19:39.746
equally as you are.

19:39.778 --> 19:42.414
And I'm not saying you--

19:39.778 --> 19:42.414
- But we should be.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.839
But we should be.

19:42.449 --> 19:44.839
- Yes, absolutely.

19:44.116 --> 19:45.417
- We're not talking

19:44.116 --> 19:45.417
about should.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.385
We're talking

19:45.451 --> 19:46.385
about what's reality.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.855
- Absolutely, we should be.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.855
But we're not.

19:48.887 --> 19:52.759
I mean, has anybody with

19:48.887 --> 19:52.759
adult children here ever said,

19:52.791 --> 19:54.227
"Be careful.

19:54.259 --> 19:57.130
If the cops pull you over,

19:54.259 --> 19:57.130
you might get shot"?

19:57.163 --> 19:58.832
- Never. Never. Never.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.166
- Jax and Jaid can't drive yet,

20:01.201 --> 20:03.702
<i>but I worry about Oliver</i>

20:01.201 --> 20:03.702
<i>being pulled over.</i>

20:03.737 --> 20:05.238
<i>I worry about it every day.</i>

20:05.904 --> 20:09.442
Because in an instant,

20:05.904 --> 20:09.442
he's not my son.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.844
<i>He's just a Black man.</i>

20:10.876 --> 20:15.848
And, um...

20:15.882 --> 20:19.385
this world doesn't see

20:15.882 --> 20:19.385
the value of Black men.

20:19.419 --> 20:22.221
- We can say, of course,

20:19.419 --> 20:22.221
we're all equal,

20:22.255 --> 20:24.391
but I have never walked

20:22.255 --> 20:24.391
in her shoes.

20:24.423 --> 20:26.425
- I thank God

20:24.423 --> 20:26.425
and I'm so grateful

20:26.459 --> 20:28.528
that I, too, grew up

20:26.459 --> 20:28.528
in a family

20:28.560 --> 20:31.698
where you could never dislike

20:28.560 --> 20:31.698
someone

20:31.730 --> 20:33.566
or treat them differently.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.800
I grew up with that.

20:33.599 --> 20:34.800
I wasn't--

20:34.834 --> 20:36.603
- But because you haven't

20:34.834 --> 20:36.603
grown up with it

20:36.635 --> 20:38.570
doesn't mean

20:36.635 --> 20:38.570
I haven't experienced it.

20:38.605 --> 20:40.472
- No, of course not. That's--

20:38.605 --> 20:40.472
- Right.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.142
- My God, that's not at all

20:40.507 --> 20:42.142
what I'm saying.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.210
- Right.

20:42.174 --> 20:44.210
- I wish I grew up in a house

20:44.243 --> 20:46.479
where it's like, let's all,

20:44.243 --> 20:46.479
you know, everyone's the same.

20:46.512 --> 20:50.182
Like, I always grew up

20:46.512 --> 20:50.182
with "Protect yourself.

20:50.215 --> 20:51.651
"People are gonna attack you.

20:51.684 --> 20:53.752
People are

20:51.684 --> 20:53.752
gonna treat you badly."

20:53.787 --> 20:55.555
And I was in a lot of ways.

20:56.789 --> 20:59.893
<i>In elementary school,</i>

20:56.789 --> 20:59.893
<i>get little comments,</i>

20:59.925 --> 21:03.296
"slanted eyes," or you know,

20:59.925 --> 21:03.296
they make fun of my last name.

21:03.829 --> 21:06.799
<i>My parents--they didn't</i>

21:03.829 --> 21:06.799
<i>want us to engage,</i>

21:06.833 --> 21:08.801
but just keep your head down

21:06.833 --> 21:08.801
and, like, walk away,

21:08.835 --> 21:10.869
<i>'cause they were afraid</i>

21:08.835 --> 21:10.869
<i>we'd get hurt.</i>

21:10.903 --> 21:12.372
<i>And I think that's why having</i>

21:12.404 --> 21:14.773
an open conversation

21:12.404 --> 21:14.773
about race is important.

21:14.807 --> 21:16.476
- Tell me if I'm wrong.

21:16.509 --> 21:19.645
I don't want to sit down

21:16.509 --> 21:19.645
with a little four-year-old

21:19.679 --> 21:20.980
and point things out to them

21:21.809 --> 21:23.316
with these innocent

21:21.809 --> 21:23.316
little minds that never--

21:23.349 --> 21:24.250
- I agree.

21:24.284 --> 21:26.185
You shouldn't have

21:24.284 --> 21:26.185
to go to a four-year-old

21:26.219 --> 21:28.688
and say,

21:26.219 --> 21:28.688
you know, you needs to be.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.957
Like, it's a lot

21:28.721 --> 21:30.957
for a four-year-old.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.925
I get it.

21:30.990 --> 21:32.925
Yeah.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.493
I don't think you need to.

21:34.527 --> 21:36.429
But I'm going to say that

21:36.462 --> 21:38.664
to a four-year-old

21:36.462 --> 21:38.664
if he's Black.

21:38.698 --> 21:41.534
It's a privilege not to have

21:38.698 --> 21:41.534
to have that conversation.

21:41.567 --> 21:45.672
I wish I had that choice,

21:41.567 --> 21:45.672
and I don't.

21:45.704 --> 21:46.806
- Well, I've always said

21:45.704 --> 21:46.806
to them,

21:46.839 --> 21:48.842
"You guys, it doesn't matter

21:46.839 --> 21:48.842
the color of your skin."

21:48.875 --> 21:50.343
And we've had a lot of people

21:50.376 --> 21:52.578
that work for us

21:50.376 --> 21:52.578
that are very multicultural.

21:52.612 --> 21:55.615
I've had a lot of Black

21:52.612 --> 21:55.615
and Hispanic and Filipino,

21:55.647 --> 21:57.884
and my kids are used to it.

21:57.916 --> 21:59.752
I mean, some of the people

21:57.916 --> 21:59.752
they've loved most

21:59.786 --> 22:04.223
in this world

21:59.786 --> 22:04.223
are dark skin, and they--

22:04.257 --> 22:07.527
- But is the brown people

22:04.257 --> 22:07.527
only help at your house?

22:10.497 --> 22:12.198
- No.

22:10.497 --> 22:12.198
- Okay.

22:12.231 --> 22:15.680
- In fact, my mother's

22:12.231 --> 22:15.680
best friend is Black.

22:15.934 --> 22:17.369
- Awesome.

22:17.403 --> 22:19.720
I just wanted

22:17.403 --> 22:19.720
to clarify that.

22:19.720 --> 22:21.407
- It's not only brown people

22:19.720 --> 22:21.407
that work in my house.

22:21.441 --> 22:24.911
Garcelle has been to my house,

22:21.441 --> 22:24.911
so she knows that.

22:24.943 --> 22:28.314
- We already did this.

22:24.943 --> 22:28.314
I'm not reliving this.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.750
- Okay, this is

22:28.347 --> 22:30.750
a tough conversation to have.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.685
- Well...

22:30.784 --> 22:32.685
- It's heavy.

22:32.719 --> 22:34.854
- When you said, "a nice game

22:32.719 --> 22:34.854
or a dark game,"

22:34.887 --> 22:36.789
I think this is the game.

22:36.823 --> 22:38.924
- No, I don't like this game.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.626
<i>- Coming up...</i>

22:40.660 --> 22:44.230
- Rinna shared with us today

22:40.660 --> 22:44.230
that Harry has acrylic nails.

22:50.103 --> 22:50.970
<i>- You guys, can everyone</i>

22:50.103 --> 22:50.970
<i>do me a favor?</i>

22:52.105 --> 22:55.407
Can everyone just rinse

22:52.105 --> 22:55.407
their plate in the dishwasher?

22:55.442 --> 22:56.209
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:56.241 --> 22:57.711
- That will make

22:56.241 --> 22:57.711
my life easier.

22:57.743 --> 22:58.877
- When you invite us

22:57.743 --> 22:58.877
on vacation,

22:58.912 --> 23:00.446
can you just get some help?

23:00.480 --> 23:02.414
- I don't have help here,

23:00.480 --> 23:02.414
----er.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.750
- Okay, let's do it.

23:02.449 --> 23:04.750
Let's do it.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.621
- Do you want

23:06.653 --> 23:08.621
some sweet potato?

23:08.654 --> 23:11.290
- Sorry, guys, they don't have

23:08.654 --> 23:11.290
a housekeeper here.

23:11.324 --> 23:12.892
- No, you don't need

23:11.324 --> 23:12.892
to have a help here.

23:12.925 --> 23:14.626
I'm just saying that

23:12.925 --> 23:14.626
if we're all in the kitchen,

23:14.661 --> 23:15.862
we can all kind of chip in,

23:15.894 --> 23:17.931
maybe, to have someone

23:15.894 --> 23:17.931
to help us clean up.

23:17.963 --> 23:19.432
- It's not about

23:17.963 --> 23:19.432
chipping in, honey.

23:19.465 --> 23:20.700
I have a housekeeper that comes

23:20.733 --> 23:22.669
before I get here

23:20.733 --> 23:22.669
and when I leave.

23:22.701 --> 23:24.570
<i>- Kyle, what kind</i>

23:22.701 --> 23:24.570
<i>of a vacation is this?</i>

23:24.604 --> 23:27.730
We dressed for dinner,

23:24.604 --> 23:27.730
not for dishes.

23:27.106 --> 23:28.273
- I'm just saying

23:27.106 --> 23:28.273
so it's not, like,

23:28.307 --> 23:29.942
such a, you know,

23:28.307 --> 23:29.942
overwhelming...

23:29.976 --> 23:31.544
'Cause it's hard to have--

23:29.976 --> 23:31.544
- It's not overwhelming.

23:31.577 --> 23:33.480
If everyone carries one dish

23:31.577 --> 23:33.480
and rinses it,

23:33.512 --> 23:34.780
it's not overwhelming.

23:34.814 --> 23:37.549
It is one dish that--

23:37.584 --> 23:40.319
<i>all you have to do is rinse.</i>

23:40.353 --> 23:43.957
You'd think I'm asking them

23:40.353 --> 23:43.957
to detail my car or something.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.959
- I'm going to bed.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.959
- No one's brave e--

23:45.991 --> 23:46.960
- You're leaving?

23:45.991 --> 23:46.960
- I am, honey.

23:46.992 --> 23:47.961
I'll see you tomorrow.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.950
- Okay.

23:47.993 --> 23:49.950
- Thank you.

23:49.950 --> 23:50.663
[muffled dialogue]

23:50.697 --> 23:52.464
- Good night.

23:50.697 --> 23:52.464
- Good night, honey.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.567
- Dorit, you look

23:52.499 --> 23:54.567
like you're leaving.

23:54.601 --> 23:56.200
- I'm tempted to go.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.804
Erika is gone.

23:56.102 --> 23:57.804
I could use her room.

23:57.836 --> 23:59.939
- Kyle, thank you so much.

23:57.836 --> 23:59.939
It was such a fun night.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.410
- Bye, honey.

24:00.400 --> 24:01.410
See you later.

24:01.410 --> 24:02.474
- Awesome.

24:01.410 --> 24:02.474
Bye, guys.

24:02.509 --> 24:03.609
- Bye.

24:03.643 --> 24:06.479
- I'm gonna get my jammies on.

24:06.512 --> 24:08.114
<i>- You guys,</i>

24:06.512 --> 24:08.114
<i>that was hard today.</i>

24:08.147 --> 24:09.682
I'm sad that Erika is not here.

24:09.715 --> 24:11.617
- I know.

24:09.715 --> 24:11.617
I know for me,

24:11.651 --> 24:13.653
it's hard to be, like, 100%.

24:13.686 --> 24:15.549
- I felt her absence tonight.

24:15.549 --> 24:17.390
- You feel it.

24:15.549 --> 24:17.390
- Hold on. Hold on.

24:17.423 --> 24:19.526
You guys are sleeping,

24:17.423 --> 24:19.526
and Rinna shared with us today

24:19.558 --> 24:21.827
that Harry has acrylic nails.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.363
- Oh, God.

24:21.861 --> 24:23.363
- Oh, yes.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.650
- You know, Harry plays

24:23.395 --> 24:25.650
the guitar,

24:25.650 --> 24:26.700
and he gets acrylics

24:25.650 --> 24:26.700
on one hand

24:26.732 --> 24:28.680
'cause he doesn't like

24:26.732 --> 24:28.680
to use a pick.

24:28.101 --> 24:29.568
- Harry has acrylic nails?

24:29.602 --> 24:31.770
- Harry has acrylic nails

24:29.602 --> 24:31.770
on one hand.

24:31.805 --> 24:33.138
- I would--

24:31.805 --> 24:33.138
you know what I'm gonna do?

24:33.173 --> 24:35.750
I'm gonna ask him

24:33.173 --> 24:35.750
to send us a picture.

24:35.750 --> 24:36.809
- But you need to say,

24:35.750 --> 24:36.809
"Honey, Kyle's looking

24:36.843 --> 24:39.846
for someone for good acrylics.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.846
Show me your nails."

24:39.878 --> 24:42.819
- Kyle's looking for inspo.

24:39.878 --> 24:42.819
Send me your nails,

24:47.953 --> 24:51.891

24:55.894 --> 24:58.832

25:59.625 --> 26:00.826
How are you feeling?

26:00.859 --> 26:03.630
Did she text you back, Erika?

26:03.663 --> 26:05.309
- Oh, I don't think so.

26:03.663 --> 26:05.309
- Yesterday.

26:05.309 --> 26:06.319
- I don't think so,

26:05.309 --> 26:06.319
and that's okay.

26:06.660 --> 26:07.834
- Okay.

26:06.660 --> 26:07.834
- As long as she knows

26:07.866 --> 26:09.635
how I--

26:07.866 --> 26:09.635
you know, what I was feeling.

26:09.669 --> 26:11.104
- Yeah.

26:11.136 --> 26:13.173
[phone chimes]

26:13.205 --> 26:14.606
- Rinna.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.420
- Wait, hold on.

26:14.641 --> 26:16.420
I'll be there in a second.

26:16.759 --> 26:17.443
Hang on.

26:17.477 --> 26:19.450

26:30.656 --> 26:32.125

26:32.157 --> 26:34.728

26:32.157 --> 26:34.728

like, yeah.

26:38.980 --> 26:40.660
Someone sent it to me.

26:46.740 --> 26:47.906
How bad?

26:47.941 --> 26:49.108
I have to read.

26:47.941 --> 26:49.108
I have to have copies.

26:49.142 --> 26:50.643
- It's just too long.

26:50.676 --> 26:53.789
I can't--like,

26:50.676 --> 26:53.789
it's gonna take a minute.

26:54.213 --> 26:57.150
- I mean, the article is like,

26:54.213 --> 26:57.150
"The rise and fall."

26:57.182 --> 27:00.653
I thought it couldn't get

27:00.686 --> 27:05.579

27:26.913 --> 27:29.490

27:35.587 --> 27:39.224
that--

27:39.259 --> 27:41.161
that someone

27:39.259 --> 27:41.161

27:41.193 --> 27:42.929
of people like that.

- It liter--it's so heartbreak.

27:42.961 --> 27:45.798
It's, like, it kills me.

27:45.832 --> 27:46.932
- Oh, my God.

27:45.832 --> 27:46.932
Oh, my God.

27:46.965 --> 27:48.867
- It kills me.

27:46.965 --> 27:48.867
"LA Times" is really--you know,

'cause he's like such a legend

since 7:30.

28:53.633 --> 28:55.769
- Have you seen the latest?

28:53.633 --> 28:55.769
- I did.

28:55.801 --> 28:56.935
- Did you read the whole thing?

28:56.970 --> 28:58.805
- I read the whole thing.

- Oh, you did?

So then you tell us, 'cause

28:58.837 --> 29:00.740
haven't had time to read it.

29:00.773 --> 29:02.375

29:00.773 --> 29:02.375
- Yeah. Well, yeah.

29:02.409 --> 29:03.410
And that's

29:02.409 --> 29:03.410
with the whole article.

29:03.442 --> 29:04.678
It's just so long.

29:04.711 --> 29:06.119
- They used

29:04.711 --> 29:06.119
the word Ponzi scheme.

29:06.460 --> 29:07.913
- No, they did?

29:06.460 --> 29:07.913
- Yes.

29:08.140 --> 29:09.490
- In this article?

29:08.140 --> 29:09.490
- Oh, (BLEEP)

29:09.819 --> 29:10.282
(BLEEP).

29:09.819 --> 29:10.282
- Yes.

29:10.316 --> 29:11.417
- It's taking from Peter

29:10.316 --> 29:11.417
to pay Paul.

29:11.451 --> 29:13.752
- Yes.

29:11.451 --> 29:13.752
- Is someone going to jail?

29:14.287 --> 29:17.230
- Well, if he's found guilty,

29:14.287 --> 29:17.230
yeah, he's going to jail.

29:17.230 --> 29:18.424
- (BLEEP).

29:17.230 --> 29:18.424
- Let's just think

29:18.458 --> 29:20.727
about the--when Madoff

29:18.458 --> 29:20.727
is going through this.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.162
- It screams Madoff.

29:22.194 --> 29:27.200
- Was--was Ruth Madoff

29:22.194 --> 29:27.200
implicated in that whole--

29:27.232 --> 29:28.768
- No, she wasn't implicated.

29:28.801 --> 29:30.359
- But she didn't go to jail

29:28.801 --> 29:30.359
or anything?

29:30.359 --> 29:31.704
- She did not go to jail.

29:30.359 --> 29:31.704
- Right.

29:31.738 --> 29:33.205
- And here's the--here's

29:31.738 --> 29:33.205
gonna be the tricky part.

29:33.239 --> 29:36.276
If Erika's business

29:33.239 --> 29:36.276
is under her name

29:36.308 --> 29:39.450
and was accepting these funds,

29:36.308 --> 29:39.450
that's trouble.

29:39.846 --> 29:41.114
That's not good.

29:41.146 --> 29:42.248
- What's gonna happen to Erika?

29:42.281 --> 29:43.817
That's what I want to know.

29:43.849 --> 29:46.318
- I mean, there's gonna have

29:43.849 --> 29:46.318
to be some reconciliation

29:46.353 --> 29:47.953
where she goes to court.

29:48.539 --> 29:52.579
If she did receive $20 million

29:48.539 --> 29:52.579
from him, from the firm,

29:52.579 --> 29:54.861
that money should be going back

29:52.579 --> 29:54.861
to all the victims.

29:54.894 --> 29:57.197
- And is that money gone,

29:54.894 --> 29:57.197
spent, frozen?

29:57.230 --> 29:58.865
What's--what is the situation

29:57.230 --> 29:58.865
with that?

29:58.897 --> 30:00.329
- We don't know that.

30:00.660 --> 30:01.334
- I think it's gone.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.169
- Well, then she's ----ed.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.270
- Well, she might be.

30:03.202 --> 30:05.270
- (BLEEP).

30:05.305 --> 30:07.740
- Lisa, I know.

30:05.305 --> 30:07.740
Girl, this is not good.

30:07.773 --> 30:09.420
- It's not good.

30:09.750 --> 30:10.777
- Hi, Dorit.

30:09.750 --> 30:10.777
- Hi, baby.

30:10.809 --> 30:11.778
- Good morning.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.179
<i>- I can't even imagine.</i>

30:13.212 --> 30:14.913
Every day you wake up

30:13.212 --> 30:14.913
and something new.

30:14.948 --> 30:16.160
- Yeah.

30:16.490 --> 30:18.180
- You know,

30:16.490 --> 30:18.180
my divorce was public,

30:18.509 --> 30:20.119
and that was hard.

30:18.509 --> 30:20.119
It's hard when people

30:20.153 --> 30:21.954
know stuff

30:20.153 --> 30:21.954
and they don't even know you,

30:21.988 --> 30:23.890
you know what I mean?

30:24.190 --> 30:26.492
- It just feels like

30:24.190 --> 30:26.492
it can't--it can't be worse.

30:26.526 --> 30:28.694
- Wow.

30:28.728 --> 30:31.309
<i>It's not a tabloid.</i>

30:28.728 --> 30:31.309
<i>It's the "LA Times."</i>

30:31.640 --> 30:33.232
And I can't imagine

30:31.640 --> 30:33.232
this article came out

30:33.266 --> 30:35.201
without her getting a heads-up.

30:35.234 --> 30:37.537
Let's go say hi to Rob,

30:35.234 --> 30:37.537
hi to the kids.

30:37.569 --> 30:40.440
Which would explain

30:37.569 --> 30:40.440
why she flipped out at me

30:40.472 --> 30:41.775
and she left La Quinta.

30:41.807 --> 30:43.809
<i>So it happened to be me,</i>

30:43.843 --> 30:45.944
but I think

30:43.843 --> 30:45.944
it could have been anybody.

30:46.378 --> 30:48.248
Bye, La Quinta.

30:49.490 --> 30:50.316
- The article

30:49.490 --> 30:50.316
that just came out.

30:50.349 --> 30:51.951
- It said

30:50.349 --> 30:51.951
that he's been running

30:51.984 --> 30:53.787
his business

30:51.984 --> 30:53.787
like a Ponzi scheme.

30:53.819 --> 30:55.221
- Well, that's what

30:53.819 --> 30:55.221
we were just saying.

30:55.255 --> 30:56.522
- That's what it says

30:55.255 --> 30:56.522
in the article.

30:56.556 --> 30:57.824
- Yeah, it says that.

30:57.856 --> 30:59.392
- The Boeing victims

30:57.856 --> 30:59.392
were not paid.

30:59.425 --> 31:02.950
The orphans

30:59.425 --> 31:02.950
from the plane crash,

31:02.127 --> 31:03.762
which breaks my heart.

31:03.797 --> 31:05.198
- There's not only

31:03.797 --> 31:05.198
orphans involved.

31:05.230 --> 31:08.535
There's a burn victim.

31:05.230 --> 31:08.535
There's a group of women.

31:08.567 --> 31:09.903
- The hormone.

31:09.935 --> 31:11.371
- Yes.

31:09.935 --> 31:11.371
They weren't paid.

31:11.403 --> 31:12.271
- Because they got cancer

31:12.305 --> 31:14.307
from, supposedly, taking

31:12.305 --> 31:14.307
the hormones.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.108
- Yes, that's right.

31:16.142 --> 31:18.779
- It's awful

31:16.142 --> 31:18.779
on every single level.

31:18.779 --> 31:19.813
We all know it's horrible.

31:19.846 --> 31:21.748
<i>- These aren't</i>

31:19.846 --> 31:21.748
<i>white-collar crimes.</i>

31:21.780 --> 31:24.839
<i>These are crimes</i>

31:21.780 --> 31:24.839
<i>that have victims.</i>

31:24.116 --> 31:26.519
It looks like this is

31:24.116 --> 31:26.519
a lot bigger

31:26.553 --> 31:31.910
and has been going on

31:26.553 --> 31:31.910
a lot longer than we were told.

31:31.910 --> 31:33.226
- Do you think she knew

31:31.910 --> 31:33.226
about this article coming out?

31:33.259 --> 31:34.861
- Yes.

31:33.259 --> 31:34.861
- I think she did.

31:34.894 --> 31:36.796
- That's one of the reasons

31:34.894 --> 31:36.796
she left yesterday.

31:36.829 --> 31:39.231
- Right. I mean, yeah,

31:36.829 --> 31:39.231
she was upset with Garcelle.

31:39.265 --> 31:40.467
- That's right.

31:40.500 --> 31:42.836
- I mean, this article

31:40.500 --> 31:42.836
is implying

31:42.868 --> 31:45.838
that Erika was complicit

31:42.868 --> 31:45.838
and knew everything.

31:45.872 --> 31:49.942
I mean, how do you have

31:45.872 --> 31:49.942
a business and not know?

31:51.344 --> 31:53.445
- If I had $20 million

31:51.344 --> 31:53.445
in my account,

31:53.480 --> 31:56.281
whether it was over 20 years

31:53.480 --> 31:56.281
or one year,

31:56.316 --> 31:58.351
it would be very strange.

31:58.384 --> 31:59.519
But I also know

31:58.384 --> 31:59.519
where my homes are.

31:59.551 --> 32:03.455
- See, I'd always been told

31:59.551 --> 32:03.455
that we have a house here.

32:03.490 --> 32:05.791
But I still don't have

32:03.490 --> 32:05.791
any addresses

- Look at that ring.

33:47.930 --> 33:48.427
- Thank you.

33:48.461 --> 33:51.463
- It's basically like wearing

33:48.461 --> 33:51.463

33:51.498 --> 33:53.566
- I mean, it's literally been

33:51.498 --> 33:53.566
since we've known her.

33:54.433 --> 33:55.934
So everything we thought,

33:55.969 --> 33:57.403
the picture

33:55.969 --> 33:57.403
that was being painted,

33:57.436 --> 34:00.472
is a very, very, very different

33:57.436 --> 34:00.472

You've known her six years.

34:19.458 --> 34:21.226
- I don't know her.

34:21.260 --> 34:24.639

34:21.260 --> 34:24.639
not known her at all.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.666

this together.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.681

41:24.818 --> 41:27.686

41:24.818 --> 41:27.686
infidelities and everything.

41:27.721 --> 41:30.322
- But I had asked her.

41:27.721 --> 41:30.322
She came to my house,

41:30.356 --> 41:33.929
and I said to her,

41:30.356 --> 41:33.929
"Is there a third party?"

41:33.126 --> 41:34.760
<i>I went to a store,</i>

41:34.793 --> 41:36.795

41:34.793 --> 41:36.795
a salesperson there said,

41:36.829 --> 41:39.833
"Well, I've seen Tom

41:36.829 --> 41:39.833
at a restaurant

41:39.865 --> 41:42.369

41:39.865 --> 41:42.369

I don't know

41:44.137 --> 41:47.106
who that person is.

41:47.106 --> 41:49.108
- So no third party

41:47.106 --> 41:49.108
on his part.

41:49.108 --> 41:50.876
- Not that I know of.

41:50.909 --> 41:53.813

41:50.909 --> 41:53.813
about Tom having an affair.

41:54.748 --> 41:57.117
But now, thinking about it,

41:57.117 --> 41:59.686
maybe she's not

41:57.117 --> 41:59.686
telling us everything.

42:01.521 --> 42:02.454
- Yes, and?

42:01.521 --> 42:02.454
- About the loss.

42:02.489 --> 42:05.579
- Well, it was, like,

42:02.489 --> 42:05.579
"I did it, you know,

42:05.579 --> 42:07.427
"and my divorce lawyer

42:05.579 --> 42:07.427

42:07.460 --> 42:10.960

42:07.460 --> 42:10.960

42:31.885 --> 42:33.152

42:33.186 --> 42:37.489

42:33.186 --> 42:37.489
