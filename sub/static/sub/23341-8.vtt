00:02.669 --> 00:04.752
Everything you love will be dust!

00:04.804 --> 00:06.838
There's no stopping it now!

00:06.840 --> 00:08.005
I like you,

00:08.057 --> 00:10.758
and I would be garbage
if I let this go any further.

00:10.810 --> 00:12.378
Pastor Ian isn't who he says he is.

00:12.378 --> 00:15.262
He belongs to some cult,
and the FBI is investigating.

00:15.297 --> 00:18.165
I found a camera.
I want that footage now.

00:18.167 --> 00:19.383
I truly doubt you'd wanna see it.

00:20.553 --> 00:22.169
I tried to turn myself in.

00:22.221 --> 00:23.337
- Tom...
- Let go!

00:23.389 --> 00:24.421
Hey, hey! Let me go!

00:24.473 --> 00:27.257
I'm Dr. Tolan, Edgar's
head doctor. Shall we?

00:27.309 --> 00:28.509
They're here, aren't they?

00:28.561 --> 00:30.227
We gotta come back for 'em.

00:30.262 --> 00:32.179
We gotta use that freezer
to block more of them

00:32.180 --> 00:33.180
from comin' over.

00:33.232 --> 00:34.348
Ahh!

00:36.000 --> 00:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:04.379 --> 01:05.379
Ughh...

01:07.099 --> 01:08.298
This is just great.

01:32.157 --> 01:35.208
All cryo chambers online.

01:53.429 --> 01:55.395
Ms. Shoemacher... they're gone!

02:02.571 --> 02:04.488
Where did they go?

02:16.118 --> 02:18.118
Your mom doesn't know you're here?

02:20.339 --> 02:22.289
Are you okay?

02:23.459 --> 02:27.177
No. No. I am pretty far from being okay.

02:27.212 --> 02:28.261
I just...

02:34.436 --> 02:37.137
I just really hope you're for real.

02:40.359 --> 02:41.475
I'm for real.

02:43.278 --> 02:44.311
And I'm here to help.

02:47.232 --> 02:49.483
Then tell me what you know
about Hollow Sky.

02:51.620 --> 02:55.122
I have been pursuing Isaac Frost

02:55.157 --> 02:58.125
and his organization for years now,

02:58.160 --> 02:59.493
and I am this close

02:59.545 --> 03:02.129
to having the whole thing by the balls.

03:02.164 --> 03:06.500
But meanwhile, your family
is still in very real danger.

03:06.552 --> 03:10.337
So, if you can share what you know...

03:10.389 --> 03:11.505
I can help you.

03:13.559 --> 03:15.392
Here's the thing...

03:15.427 --> 03:19.229
Hollow Sky is searching for something.

03:19.264 --> 03:22.482
Chasing rumors about people
who've developed abilities,

03:22.518 --> 03:26.069
powers, and some kind of machine,

03:26.105 --> 03:29.489
invented by this cryptomystic,
Arthur Forman.

03:29.525 --> 03:33.493
And... I ha... no, I didn't bring it.

03:33.529 --> 03:37.197
Okay.

03:37.249 --> 03:39.082
Luke, I'm just gonna
ask you point blank:

03:41.170 --> 03:42.502
Has Holden ever demonstrated

03:42.538 --> 03:47.541
any... odd or unusual behavior?

03:52.214 --> 03:53.513
Do flying cars count?

03:56.518 --> 04:02.189
Then yeah, I would say
he has some... unique abilities.

04:02.224 --> 04:04.057
Okay, but more importantly,

04:04.059 --> 04:07.527
Hollow Sky is a warped criminal cult.

04:07.563 --> 04:10.397
Like full stop, I mean,
they kidnapped Holden,

04:10.449 --> 04:12.449
like, held us under armed
guard against our will.

04:12.484 --> 04:14.367
- Wait, wait. Shh, shh!
- They put cameras in my house!

04:14.403 --> 04:16.403
Shh! Shh, shh, shh.

04:19.491 --> 04:21.408
They threatened us,

04:21.459 --> 04:22.542
chased us!

04:22.578 --> 04:24.127
Luke, that's why I'm here.

04:25.414 --> 04:27.080
We know about the machines.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.217
- Do you know about the machines?
- Nothing good.

04:31.336 --> 04:33.086
Elaborate.

04:33.088 --> 04:37.174
How 'bout... we start with the...

04:37.226 --> 04:41.261
location of their little...
"black helicopter compound."

04:44.149 --> 04:46.566
But you need to give me your word...

04:46.602 --> 04:49.569
that you will raid that damn place

04:49.605 --> 04:53.273
with, like... big-ass guns.

04:54.276 --> 04:55.442
Doin' the right thing.

05:03.452 --> 05:05.168
Still can't believe we're
really gonna do this.

05:05.204 --> 05:07.037
Still can't believe you
almost didn't do this,

05:07.089 --> 05:10.123
especially after you guys
got so close last time?

05:10.125 --> 05:12.092
It shouldn't even be that hard.

05:12.127 --> 05:13.460
You're suddenly
Seal Team commando now.

05:13.462 --> 05:16.129
Yeah, we walk in, snag Edgar, walk out,

05:16.181 --> 05:19.132
put him in an ancient freezer
you found buried in the woods,

05:19.184 --> 05:21.184
which will transport him
interdimensionally

05:21.220 --> 05:23.053
to another realm of existence,

05:23.105 --> 05:26.056
where Edgar will make it stop
leaking cranky demons

05:26.108 --> 05:27.440
hellbent on destroying our world,

05:27.476 --> 05:29.309
starting with the Matthews family.

05:29.311 --> 05:33.480
What is so hard about that?
Grab the Kit-Kats.

05:33.482 --> 05:36.316
I don't care how hard it is, okay?

05:36.318 --> 05:40.070
We've got one shot, one.
To pull this off.

05:41.290 --> 05:43.490
Like we talked about
last night, I'm through running.

05:43.542 --> 05:45.158
So are you.

05:45.160 --> 05:46.243
You got it, hotshot.

05:47.579 --> 05:51.464
And, um... listen.
I am totally down to rescue

05:51.500 --> 05:54.167
a fellow Hollow-Sky patient-slave,

05:54.169 --> 05:56.503
as long as you're up to it.

05:56.555 --> 05:59.172
You can't keep going on
like this forever.

05:59.224 --> 06:01.258
It's gotta be hittin' close to home.

06:01.310 --> 06:03.476
And this is the easy part.

06:03.512 --> 06:06.396
I'm only rescuing Edgar
so I can stop Diego.

06:07.516 --> 06:09.149
I know.

06:10.185 --> 06:12.402
I saw him, too.

06:13.522 --> 06:15.071
Uhh...

06:15.107 --> 06:16.439
Hey. Hey...

06:17.526 --> 06:19.359
You okay?

06:19.411 --> 06:24.497
Yeah. Sorry, just, uh...
pre-game jitters.

06:26.418 --> 06:29.169
Woo-hoo! Three points!

06:29.204 --> 06:30.420
Huh-ha!

06:30.455 --> 06:32.422
And 20 percent off!

06:32.457 --> 06:34.374
Look, Jeff, I told you,
we're not here for this.

06:34.426 --> 06:37.377
- This is my membership card, motherf...
- Funyuns!

06:39.431 --> 06:42.215
All right, listen, I only had a few
minutes to case the area,

06:42.217 --> 06:45.518
but my... somewhat
crude map here shows...

06:45.554 --> 06:48.355
Crude? No, Jeff, not crude at all.

06:48.390 --> 06:51.524
Shows that the TV room's adjacent
to the loading area there.

06:51.560 --> 06:55.478
Thursday just so happens
to be... Edgar's TV day.

06:55.530 --> 06:58.281
Now, if we're able to find
an alternate entrance

06:58.317 --> 07:00.103
- and avoid detection...
- We'll have ourselves

07:00.103 --> 07:04.154
a standard grab-and-bag.
Hey. Hey! Get back! Back! Back!

07:04.206 --> 07:05.405
I wouldn't say standard.

07:05.457 --> 07:07.290
This is a guy who blew up a TV.

07:07.326 --> 07:08.314
With his mind.

07:08.314 --> 07:11.463
And you know, as a TV-exploding veteran,

07:11.463 --> 07:13.330
I can promise you...

07:13.382 --> 07:17.334
we don't know what this guy
will do, or doesn't do...

07:17.386 --> 07:18.418
or won't do.

07:22.090 --> 07:25.342
Why didn't he wake up? Every other
cryo patient gone, but not Frost.

07:26.428 --> 07:29.479
- Why?
- Good question.

07:29.514 --> 07:32.182
I've been wondering the same thing.

07:32.234 --> 07:34.234
But does it really matter?

07:34.269 --> 07:36.102
Would it explain any of this?

07:36.154 --> 07:38.104
Or the side effects?

07:38.106 --> 07:40.357
Get me up to speed. Do you have
any idea where they went?

07:40.409 --> 07:42.409
We're not the Missing Persons Bureau,

07:42.444 --> 07:44.277
and it's time we cut our losses.

07:44.329 --> 07:46.329
We're moving Frost to another lab.

07:46.365 --> 07:48.415
Our people on the outside are
keeping the authorities at bay

07:48.450 --> 07:51.084
until this can all get broomed,

07:51.119 --> 07:53.453
before anyone in the
congregation gets wind of it.

07:53.455 --> 07:57.257
Why does it seem
like you're just checking boxes?

07:57.292 --> 07:59.125
Because that's what managers do.

07:59.127 --> 08:02.095
Anticipate. Decide.
Be proactive, not reactive.

08:03.298 --> 08:04.464
Some of this you can learn at school.

08:04.516 --> 08:06.433
Now those who wear the big-boy pants

08:06.468 --> 08:09.352
know that we're sitting on nearly
nine figures in contributions.

08:09.388 --> 08:11.271
Our job is to protect that investment,

08:11.306 --> 08:13.189
as well as the belief system
of our clientele,

08:13.225 --> 08:16.142
which this would, in my estimation,

08:16.144 --> 08:17.277
threaten.

08:17.312 --> 08:20.146
Yeah. It's all threatening something.

08:22.234 --> 08:24.150
It just seems like our clientele

08:24.202 --> 08:25.485
aren't the only ones
you've been lookin' out for.

08:25.537 --> 08:27.203
What's that supposed to mean?

08:27.239 --> 08:29.155
Means I don't believe you.

08:29.207 --> 08:31.157
I see.

08:31.209 --> 08:34.410
And yet, I thought you'd
do anything for the cause.

08:35.547 --> 08:37.380
Maybe it's time you started acting

08:37.416 --> 08:39.499
like you believed in something.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.419
Well, I believe we have
a much bigger problem.

08:43.472 --> 08:45.472
What's that?

08:45.507 --> 08:48.058
The FBI.

08:48.093 --> 08:50.060
They've been working
with the Holden Matthews family.

08:50.095 --> 08:54.481
From what I understand...
they're extremely proactive.

09:06.290 --> 09:07.372
Diane.

09:08.509 --> 09:10.638
- Stay away.
- Hey. Please.

09:10.835 --> 09:12.000
I need you to understand.

09:13.087 --> 09:15.170
My feelings for you were true.

09:16.257 --> 09:18.257
I never betrayed you in my heart.

09:18.309 --> 09:20.058
Really?

09:20.094 --> 09:21.143
And where was your heart

09:21.178 --> 09:23.095
when you were recording
me and the boys in our home

09:23.147 --> 09:24.146
without my knowledge?

09:25.232 --> 09:27.182
What reason could you possibly have?

09:29.236 --> 09:31.797
Do you understand that
I will destroy any threat

09:31.797 --> 09:34.189
to protect my children?
So are you gonna stop apologizing

09:34.191 --> 09:36.191
and tell me something
that will actually help?

09:38.946 --> 09:40.863
No. I didn't think so.

09:46.036 --> 09:48.203
Diane, I'm... I'm not a bad man.

09:48.205 --> 09:50.172
I'm just not a strong man.

09:50.207 --> 09:52.040
We were... We were together for months

09:52.042 --> 09:54.209
before they came to me
with this request.

09:55.930 --> 09:58.964
- And by then, I was...
- You thought it wouldn't matter.

10:03.053 --> 10:04.186
Yes!

10:08.142 --> 10:10.225
I have a meeting with the FBI today.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.112
So if you...

10:15.399 --> 10:18.951
ever cared about me, or Luke, or Holden,

10:18.986 --> 10:19.985
come with me.

10:20.037 --> 10:23.038
Talk to them. It's your choice.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.241
Thank you.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.296
Thank you, I will. I'll be there.

10:54.104 --> 10:56.188
Lunchtime, fellas.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.024
Suit yourself.

11:08.118 --> 11:09.952
Hey, who's in there?

11:09.954 --> 11:12.087
Hey! Hey!

11:23.968 --> 11:25.350
You're the one who
attacked my son, aren't you?

11:25.386 --> 11:26.935
You son of a bitch.

11:29.974 --> 11:31.106
Turn around.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.905
The hell did you say?

11:49.043 --> 11:53.128
You can't protect your son... Papa.

12:01.088 --> 12:04.890
What's coming at your son, Holden...

12:11.015 --> 12:13.098
you can't protect him.

12:20.024 --> 12:22.024
You better hope to hell
I never get outta here.

12:33.203 --> 12:34.202
How's it going?

12:44.181 --> 12:46.014
Hey, can you get the door? Thank you.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.275
Okay. She's in.

13:03.033 --> 13:06.034
It's like Christmas mornin'
every Thursday, am I right?

13:06.070 --> 13:10.872
No. I said, we can't take
anything frozen today.

13:10.908 --> 13:12.207
Sorry, it's gotta go back in the truck.

13:12.242 --> 13:15.877
Are you kidding me? I can't let
this stuff melt in my truck.

13:15.913 --> 13:17.045
Not my problem.

13:23.971 --> 13:25.253
Through reception.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.256
Corridor two, which leads
to the TV break room.

13:28.308 --> 13:32.060
Great map, gents.
Six-year-old draw this thing?

13:37.151 --> 13:39.184
I'm at the TV room.

13:39.236 --> 13:41.269
I got it. I got it from here.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.021
- Sshh!
- What?

13:43.073 --> 13:44.072
Okay? I can't hear.

13:44.108 --> 13:45.273
Guys, we may have a problem.

13:45.275 --> 13:47.275
It's 2:00 p.m.

13:47.277 --> 13:49.361
You guys said Edgar
wouldn't miss an Alf rerun

13:49.413 --> 13:51.079
for all the freezers in Kansas,

13:51.115 --> 13:54.116
so where... is he?

13:54.118 --> 13:56.284
I wouldn't eat a cat,
I only like kittens.

14:02.009 --> 14:04.042
Do you even know what Edgar looks like?

14:04.094 --> 14:06.094
Yeah, okay... yeah,
I'm pretty sure I remember,

14:06.130 --> 14:08.263
a tall, fat, Chinese guy
with red hair, right?

14:09.883 --> 14:11.933
- Ice cream.
- Hey.

14:11.969 --> 14:13.268
- Ice cream.
- Sssh. Ssshh.

14:13.303 --> 14:16.583
There's no ice cream today,
I told you before.

14:17.141 --> 14:19.858
- Ice... cream.
- C'mon. Calm down.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.310
- Calm down.
- Ice cream.

14:22.312 --> 14:25.981
- Guys!
- Ice cream! Ice cream!

14:26.033 --> 14:28.066
Ice cream!

14:29.319 --> 14:32.154
Okay, girl. I guess plan B is on you.

14:32.156 --> 14:34.039
What else is new?

14:34.074 --> 14:36.992
- Sit down!
- Ice cream!

14:36.994 --> 14:38.326
Ice cream.

14:40.330 --> 14:43.999
Explain to me why receiving
won't hold my stuff

14:44.051 --> 14:45.300
till the freezer's fixed?

14:45.335 --> 14:48.336
I mean, you know ice cream melts, right?

14:53.343 --> 14:56.344
Hey, guys... it looks like
your, uh, Dr. Tolan?

14:56.346 --> 14:58.180
Dead to rights.

15:00.984 --> 15:03.068
Except, why is she wearing a parka?

15:03.103 --> 15:04.853
Jeff, Jeff! Jeff, Jeff, Jeff!

15:04.905 --> 15:05.987
We got Tolan.

15:06.023 --> 15:07.322
Edgar can't be far away.

15:43.227 --> 15:45.894
Put the game away
and give me your radio.

16:05.153 --> 16:07.286
I lost Tolan in the freight elevator,
which is locked.

16:07.322 --> 16:08.404
This way.

16:08.456 --> 16:10.156
What do you mean it's locked?

16:10.208 --> 16:11.157
You need a key card to get in.

16:12.460 --> 16:14.210
Ice cream!

16:14.245 --> 16:16.295
Okay, well, Edgar's not here.

16:17.415 --> 16:19.332
Why didn't you check his room?

16:19.334 --> 16:21.250
Using these crappy maps?

16:21.302 --> 16:23.469
- Hey...
- Besides, there's guards everywhere,

16:23.505 --> 16:25.238
and everything's locked.

16:25.273 --> 16:27.540
I mean, what do I look like, Buffy?

16:27.575 --> 16:31.310
- Kinda.
- Shhhhh! Guys, keep it down.

16:31.346 --> 16:33.563
There's no ice cream
for the TV group today.

16:33.598 --> 16:35.348
Okay, didn't you hear?

16:35.400 --> 16:37.183
But I don't want the group's ice cream.

16:37.185 --> 16:39.519
I want my ice cream!

16:39.571 --> 16:41.270
I want ice cream!

16:41.322 --> 16:42.522
It's Thursday!

16:42.524 --> 16:44.357
Where's my ice cream?

16:44.359 --> 16:46.158
You know ice cream melts, right?

16:47.445 --> 16:49.495
- Ice cream.
- Edgar's in the freezer.

16:49.531 --> 16:52.448
Yeah, we know, we gotta
get Edgar to the freezer.

16:52.500 --> 16:55.201
No no no, no. Edgar's in the freezer.

16:55.253 --> 16:56.536
Here.

16:56.538 --> 16:58.371
Ice cream!

16:58.373 --> 16:59.589
We gotta get down there.

16:59.624 --> 17:01.340
Ice cream!

17:02.427 --> 17:03.459
Wait here.

17:05.213 --> 17:06.462
I've got an idea.

17:06.513 --> 17:09.515
It's ice cream time! Here, everyone!

17:09.550 --> 17:11.384
Here you go. We've got chocolate.

17:11.386 --> 17:13.386
Who likes tutti fruiti? I know you do.

17:13.387 --> 17:14.554
And I know you do.

17:16.223 --> 17:17.223
Nice.

17:22.396 --> 17:23.563
Here's one for you.

17:26.117 --> 17:28.483
Nice.

17:28.536 --> 17:30.486
C'mon, let's go. Let's go!

17:47.138 --> 17:48.337
He'll show up.

17:53.261 --> 17:55.394
And... if he doesn't show up,

17:55.430 --> 17:58.481
it doesn't necessarily mean
he was lying about everything.

17:58.516 --> 17:59.482
You know?

18:02.153 --> 18:03.519
I understand.

18:03.571 --> 18:05.237
- Thank you.
- Mm.

18:05.273 --> 18:08.407
But it's not just about Ian anymore,
it's about my family now.

18:10.161 --> 18:12.194
Believe me, I get it.

18:12.246 --> 18:14.447
I have a handful myself.

18:14.449 --> 18:17.249
James. Seventeen.

18:17.285 --> 18:19.418
He's playing the saxophone
in the school band tonight,

18:19.454 --> 18:21.120
and I'll miss it...

18:21.172 --> 18:22.254
again.

18:23.291 --> 18:24.507
I know, I work too much.

18:24.542 --> 18:26.292
Yeah. I know how you feel.

18:28.463 --> 18:31.180
God, Holden's younger brother Luke,

18:31.215 --> 18:34.550
he's had to practically
fend for himself most of his life.

18:34.602 --> 18:36.385
I didn't know you had another son.

18:38.189 --> 18:39.555
Can we get a couple of refills?

19:05.133 --> 19:06.382
There it is.

19:21.232 --> 19:23.065
Son of a...

19:23.101 --> 19:24.400
What the hell were you thinking?

19:29.273 --> 19:31.357
You know I don't like this,

19:31.409 --> 19:34.076
but I'm trying to help you.

19:34.112 --> 19:37.163
And I can't help you unless
you give me some answers,

19:37.198 --> 19:38.447
so, why don't we try again?

19:38.499 --> 19:40.533
Edgar?

19:40.585 --> 19:43.085
How are you starting fires?

19:44.338 --> 19:45.454
Talk to me.

19:45.506 --> 19:48.124
Have you gotten a hold of medications?

19:48.176 --> 19:50.509
Chemicals? Is there some trick?

19:50.545 --> 19:53.095
Why are you doing this to me?

19:53.131 --> 19:57.299
Edgar, these past few weeks,
it's nothing but outbursts

19:57.351 --> 20:00.352
and Holden, Holden, Holden.

20:00.388 --> 20:03.472
Yes. I've looked into
Holden Matthews, Edgar,

20:03.524 --> 20:05.224
he was also in a coma.

20:05.276 --> 20:07.393
Just like you.

20:08.479 --> 20:11.230
I find that rather coincidental,
don't you?

20:11.282 --> 20:14.316
Can he do unusual things, too?

20:14.368 --> 20:15.401
Stop.

20:17.238 --> 20:18.571
Something's not right.

20:19.574 --> 20:21.490
Edgar.

20:21.542 --> 20:23.492
These aren't doctor questions.

20:37.592 --> 20:40.392
Edgar, you don't wanna do this.

20:41.429 --> 20:43.179
You know it's pointless.

20:46.400 --> 20:50.269
Hey, Eddie, we've got
a disturbance in the TV room.

20:57.578 --> 21:01.280
This can be over, Edgar. Anytime.

21:31.444 --> 21:33.361
All right, we need to
haul ass right now.

21:33.413 --> 21:35.496
Let's put this rent-a-cop
outta commission ASAP.

21:35.532 --> 21:38.366
Yeah.

21:39.536 --> 21:40.535
What?

21:42.539 --> 21:44.539
- Outta commission.
- Right.

21:44.541 --> 21:47.542
Let's go coma-boy,
you got a smorgasbord here.

21:47.594 --> 21:48.543
Okay.

21:49.679 --> 21:51.346
Too noisy.

21:52.549 --> 21:53.631
Too Manson.

21:53.683 --> 21:56.384
- Um...
- Dude.

21:59.472 --> 22:01.389
Okay.

22:20.660 --> 22:22.543
Nice try.

22:22.579 --> 22:24.545
They can't all be winners.

22:24.581 --> 22:26.381
Okay, Jeff, you got any ideas?

22:26.416 --> 22:28.249
Jeff? Jeff?

22:28.251 --> 22:29.584
Excuse me?

22:29.586 --> 22:31.419
Mr. Fat-Ass?

22:31.421 --> 22:35.340
Are you gonna save any of that food
in the freezer for the rest of us?

22:38.261 --> 22:40.428
- Is he always this impatient?
- I...

22:43.433 --> 22:44.482
Damn!

22:47.437 --> 22:50.405
All right... now I'm ready.

22:50.440 --> 22:52.240
Ooh!

22:56.279 --> 22:59.280
Ooh...

23:01.534 --> 23:03.251
- Ahhh...
- Oooh!

23:05.622 --> 23:07.505
Go. Go!

23:08.625 --> 23:10.124
Now! Now!

23:10.176 --> 23:12.460
I got this!

23:12.512 --> 23:14.545
Ohh! Ohh!

23:16.299 --> 23:17.432
Edgar!

23:19.185 --> 23:21.469
Um, we're here to rescue you!

23:21.471 --> 23:23.388
That's the best you got?

23:27.310 --> 23:28.359
Ooh.

23:30.313 --> 23:32.146
Ooh!

23:36.569 --> 23:37.568
Ahh!

23:37.620 --> 23:39.153
Aaah!

23:41.624 --> 23:42.657
Okay, here we go.

23:52.669 --> 23:54.168
Come on!

23:56.222 --> 23:59.223
- You okay?
- You good? Okay. Let's go!

24:04.564 --> 24:05.596
Jeff!

24:09.185 --> 24:11.152
- Jeff!
- Uhh!

24:18.611 --> 24:20.528
Jeff! Open the door!

24:20.530 --> 24:23.331
We got trapped in here! We've gotta go!

24:27.454 --> 24:29.420
Uggh! Oww!

24:44.521 --> 24:45.520
Were you ready for that?

24:51.394 --> 24:52.393
Hey.

24:53.446 --> 24:55.396
You better be worth it, man.

24:55.448 --> 24:57.231
Saddle up, let's get
the hell outta here.

24:57.283 --> 24:58.449
Yeah.

25:04.407 --> 25:05.573
Good job.

25:08.294 --> 25:11.496
Ohh... party's over, Scarface.

25:13.216 --> 25:15.216
Try to focus.

25:51.371 --> 25:54.372
Okay, I know that I said that
we shouldn't see each other,

25:54.424 --> 25:58.626
and... you know, I totally butchered
that whole conversation,

25:58.678 --> 26:01.345
'cause... why are you leading with that?

26:01.381 --> 26:04.432
Why? God, you're such an idiot.

26:04.467 --> 26:06.267
Luke.

26:08.471 --> 26:10.138
Uhh...

26:10.140 --> 26:12.223
hey, Willa.

26:14.227 --> 26:15.443
Are you okay?

26:16.563 --> 26:18.613
Yeah. Yeah, I, uh...

26:20.283 --> 26:21.649
Hey, look, I... I'm... I'm sorry,

26:21.701 --> 26:25.153
I... I actually really despise people
that just show up like this.

26:25.155 --> 26:28.289
I mean, why can't they
just pick up the phone first?

26:29.375 --> 26:30.575
Let you know that they're coming?

26:31.661 --> 26:34.162
Do you... wanna come in?

26:35.215 --> 26:37.331
Yeah. I do.

26:37.333 --> 26:38.332
Good.

26:39.502 --> 26:41.169
I wanna show you something.

26:45.391 --> 26:47.425
Whoa-hah-hoh.

26:50.430 --> 26:52.480
Wha... So, uh...

26:52.515 --> 26:56.350
this thing also takes
you into the Realm?

26:56.402 --> 26:57.351
At one time, it did.

26:59.239 --> 27:00.188
What...

27:01.491 --> 27:06.327
very, uh... county fair.

27:06.362 --> 27:10.414
Mm, before Hollow Sky turned
into a theme park, I guess.

27:14.621 --> 27:18.539
But if this machine
takes you into the Realm,

27:18.541 --> 27:22.376
I mean, like, wh... why the hell
are you trying to fix it?

27:22.428 --> 27:26.430
Because, Holden believes he did
something to corrupt the Realm,

27:26.466 --> 27:29.350
that he let something bad
cross over into our world.

27:29.385 --> 27:31.302
If I can get this machine to work,

27:31.354 --> 27:33.187
I think I can set things right,

27:33.223 --> 27:34.522
make everything how it was.

27:34.557 --> 27:37.225
You wanna know what I think?

27:37.227 --> 27:40.561
I... I think it's time to stop
obsessing over magic machines.

27:40.613 --> 27:43.147
- Luke.
- Willa.

27:43.199 --> 27:44.532
I spoke to the FBI.

27:46.286 --> 27:48.152
- You what?
- I had to.

27:48.204 --> 27:51.572
They already have an investigation
going on for Hollow Sky.

27:51.574 --> 27:56.210
Hey... Hey? I really think
that they can help us.

27:56.246 --> 27:59.297
And what's gonna happen
to Arthur when they help us?

27:59.332 --> 28:01.415
When the FBI breaks all of this open,

28:01.467 --> 28:03.251
what's gonna happen to him?

28:03.303 --> 28:06.387
Something that should've
happened long ago.

28:08.258 --> 28:09.557
He's right, Willa.

28:09.592 --> 28:11.592
- It's caused too much suffering.
- Arthur...

28:13.429 --> 28:16.430
Maybe it's time for all of
this to come to an end.

28:19.235 --> 28:20.518
I'm ready if you are.

28:27.243 --> 28:28.492
C'mon, c'mon c'mon, c'mon.

28:28.528 --> 28:30.494
Oh, no no no no no.
It's supposed... It's supposed to work.

28:32.615 --> 28:35.166
Oh, great.

28:35.201 --> 28:36.284
Holden Matthews.

28:38.371 --> 28:40.254
So nice to see you again.

28:40.290 --> 28:41.455
You too, Dr. Chang.

28:43.176 --> 28:44.125
Stand back.

28:56.556 --> 28:59.473
We may not have time for the usual
wind-up here, know what I mean?

29:15.375 --> 29:18.326
Edgar? You've
known me for many years,

29:18.328 --> 29:21.295
I've always looked out for you,
you're safe here.

29:21.331 --> 29:24.332
We've always taken care of you
when no one else would.

29:26.469 --> 29:29.220
Those men from yesterday,
they weren't who they said they were,

29:29.255 --> 29:30.471
that makes them liars.

29:30.506 --> 29:32.173
Edgar, you understand that?

29:34.427 --> 29:38.145
You guys move on. I got this.

29:44.354 --> 29:48.189
Edgar... we're your family here.

29:49.575 --> 29:51.359
My family's dead.

29:53.496 --> 29:55.529
Don't talk about my family.

29:55.531 --> 29:57.164
Edgar...

30:06.542 --> 30:08.592
He's turning this place into an oven!

30:10.546 --> 30:11.629
Uhhh...

30:15.518 --> 30:18.185
This can be over... anytime.

30:23.393 --> 30:24.475
Edgar.

30:24.527 --> 30:26.227
Oh god!

30:26.279 --> 30:27.395
Edgar.

30:27.447 --> 30:29.280
Please!

30:30.566 --> 30:31.532
Edgar!

30:33.403 --> 30:34.568
We need to go.

30:36.406 --> 30:38.205
It's over...

30:38.241 --> 30:39.623
now.

30:54.750 --> 30:56.535
Just let me go!

30:57.144 --> 30:58.978
I... I won't tell anyone.

30:59.013 --> 31:01.897
I promise. I mean, I haven't
even seen your faces.

31:05.069 --> 31:09.188
Problem is... I don't believe
anything you say...

31:10.274 --> 31:11.323
because you lied to me before

31:11.359 --> 31:13.108
about recording your surveillance.

31:13.160 --> 31:16.161
I didn't lie. I didn't lie.

31:16.197 --> 31:17.997
Holden's folks wouldn't
have hit the panic button

31:18.032 --> 31:20.464
and called the feds
if they didn't see proof

31:20.464 --> 31:21.834
that you were spying on 'em.

31:21.834 --> 31:24.203
Me? No no, not me,
no, y... your people...

31:24.255 --> 31:26.205
- I was just...
- Only following orders?

31:27.959 --> 31:29.925
You know, I think I've heard
that someplace before.

31:29.961 --> 31:32.211
Listen. Listen.

31:32.213 --> 31:35.381
I have been a Hollow Sky
youth leader for six years.

31:35.383 --> 31:38.183
I wouldn't have done anything
to harm the church.

31:39.220 --> 31:41.053
Then why were you running?

31:45.109 --> 31:46.942
I was coming in from the cold.

31:46.978 --> 31:48.277
Coming in to whom?

31:50.197 --> 31:52.147
I'm not your enemy.

31:52.199 --> 31:55.150
I have followed the teachings
of Isaac Frost.

31:55.202 --> 31:56.986
That's interesting.

31:57.038 --> 31:58.237
So then you'd say
that you're a true believer?

31:58.289 --> 32:00.322
- Yes.
- And as a man of God,

32:00.374 --> 32:02.447
you believe in what
we're trying to accomplish?

32:02.447 --> 32:03.459
Yes.

32:03.459 --> 32:05.244
I don't mean the mental health
stuff and the yoga classes.

32:05.246 --> 32:07.046
I'm talkin' about beating death.

32:07.081 --> 32:08.297
- Yes!
- You're sayin' you believe in them?

32:08.332 --> 32:11.383
Yes! Yes! Yes, I believe in the
bridge to the afterlife.

32:11.419 --> 32:13.252
That we can cross that bridge
back and forth?

32:13.304 --> 32:15.054
Yes! Yes.

32:17.091 --> 32:19.091
Then why are you afraid to die?

32:22.263 --> 32:23.395
I'm not afraid to die.

32:26.267 --> 32:27.266
Good.

32:28.986 --> 32:32.938
Because as you know...
death is only the beginning.

32:34.025 --> 32:36.108
So then we agree...

32:36.160 --> 32:38.077
you're not gonna kill me then?

32:39.280 --> 32:40.245
No.

32:42.249 --> 32:44.116
I'm in management now.

32:55.046 --> 32:57.429
No. No, no, no.

32:57.465 --> 33:00.215
No, no, no! No! No!

33:07.191 --> 33:10.142
- Thank you.
- Here's to us.

33:10.144 --> 33:12.227
Hm-hm, and our new project.

33:12.279 --> 33:16.065
Some things are worth waiting for.

33:17.318 --> 33:19.068
Baby, I told you.

33:22.156 --> 33:25.074
Don't play with me, Tess.

33:25.126 --> 33:28.243
Something is wrong, and it's been
wrong for a while now.

33:28.295 --> 33:30.162
So just level with me
and tell me what it is.

33:30.164 --> 33:31.330
I have cancer.

33:34.385 --> 33:35.968
Ovarian.

33:45.096 --> 33:46.979
How long have you known?

33:48.349 --> 33:52.101
- Couple months.
- A couple...

33:52.153 --> 33:54.269
Wh... how on earth could you justify

33:54.321 --> 33:56.271
keeping something like this from me?

33:56.323 --> 33:57.990
I'm sorry, Robin.

33:58.025 --> 33:59.408
Robin, truly, I'm...

33:59.443 --> 34:02.995
I just could never
seem to find the words.

34:05.082 --> 34:06.115
Just listen.

34:09.253 --> 34:12.036
It's in remission.

34:12.039 --> 34:15.174
The prognosis is extremely optimistic.

34:15.208 --> 34:16.958
And that's not even the good news.

34:19.295 --> 34:21.179
What good news?

34:23.050 --> 34:25.934
I'm about to wrap
some things up at work.

34:25.969 --> 34:26.935
I mean...

34:28.139 --> 34:30.304
You mean... retire?

34:32.143 --> 34:36.311
I'm on the brink...
of finally reaping the benefits

34:36.362 --> 34:39.063
of all this... struggle.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.985
We both know that things
have been complicated at work.

34:45.239 --> 34:47.206
I know.

34:47.241 --> 34:48.322
You don't have to explain.

34:50.293 --> 34:51.409
To see this through...

34:53.130 --> 34:55.964
to finally do the things
that we talked about,

34:56.000 --> 34:57.132
dreamed about.

34:58.385 --> 35:01.086
We're going to have to go
as far away as possible...

35:02.306 --> 35:05.140
and never come back.

35:09.096 --> 35:10.979
You got an exit strategy?

35:14.068 --> 35:15.234
Yeah.

35:15.269 --> 35:17.186
You bet your ass.

35:21.275 --> 35:24.193
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy, easy.

35:24.245 --> 35:25.944
Easy!

35:25.946 --> 35:27.112
You're coming in too hot.

35:29.416 --> 35:30.365
Boom.

35:31.952 --> 35:33.952
Much as I enjoy your company,

35:34.004 --> 35:35.921
can't say I wouldn't
rather be down at Wayne's

35:35.956 --> 35:37.289
for LT's going away party.

35:37.291 --> 35:38.373
Your turn.

35:38.425 --> 35:41.093
Someone's gotta mind the store
in case of a city riot.

35:52.306 --> 35:54.056
I'm looking for the prisoner.

35:55.309 --> 35:58.110
- Come again?
- The prisoner.

36:02.199 --> 36:03.198
What prisoner?

36:07.121 --> 36:08.203
Why don't you just take a seat, homie?

36:19.917 --> 36:21.333
Senior Deputy Garza for Sheriff Dayton.

36:26.307 --> 36:27.339
Well, find him.

36:33.147 --> 36:34.146
Pete?

36:35.182 --> 36:36.348
Where the hell'd you go?

36:39.103 --> 36:40.102
Pete?

36:41.355 --> 36:43.939
Deputy Adler, respond!

36:59.373 --> 37:00.872
Pete?

37:08.882 --> 37:09.881
Pete?

37:11.101 --> 37:12.217
Are you there?!

37:21.061 --> 37:22.060
Run!

37:24.031 --> 37:25.063
Run!

37:32.072 --> 37:34.206
We're under attack, Jimmy!

37:34.241 --> 37:36.208
I saw them out front.
They're surrounding the place.

37:39.213 --> 37:40.329
Who the hell are they?

37:43.050 --> 37:44.299
What the hell?

37:56.981 --> 37:58.230
Stay calm.

37:58.265 --> 37:59.264
Take a position.

38:10.361 --> 38:12.327
Go, go! Now!

38:14.164 --> 38:15.998
Hey!

38:16.033 --> 38:18.116
What's going on out there?!

38:18.168 --> 38:20.919
Let me out!

38:36.490 --> 38:38.223
Who are you people?

39:06.504 --> 39:09.254
Do you remember, Papa,

39:09.307 --> 39:11.473
what I said about how
you couldn't protect your son?

39:15.262 --> 39:16.428
Told ya.

39:28.043 --> 39:29.209
It's here!

39:29.244 --> 39:30.377
This is where I buried it.

39:32.297 --> 39:34.080
How'd you bury it so deep?

39:34.133 --> 39:35.248
With a shovel.

39:38.253 --> 39:40.921
Edgar was amazing back there.

39:40.973 --> 39:43.173
- Yep.
- We're close!

39:43.225 --> 39:44.341
We're getting close!

39:44.393 --> 39:47.310
I'm just not sure
it's the kind of amazing

39:47.346 --> 39:49.179
I find personally attractive.

39:49.231 --> 39:50.397
You know what I mean.

39:50.432 --> 39:52.349
He was brave.

39:52.401 --> 39:53.400
You know, braver than anyone

39:53.435 --> 39:56.019
I'd ever seen up close like that before.

39:57.356 --> 39:59.406
Yeah, that is not a guy
who's ever gonna be...

39:59.441 --> 40:00.440
Normal.

40:00.442 --> 40:02.943
I thought we gave up on that whole...

40:02.995 --> 40:05.078
- I know, we did. It's just...
- It's just up here!

40:05.113 --> 40:06.363
Edgar, calm down.

40:06.415 --> 40:10.250
It's just... is that
gonna be me in 20 years?

40:10.285 --> 40:11.284
Is that where I'm heading?

40:12.454 --> 40:15.205
You know, someone's tool
rotting in a lab,

40:15.257 --> 40:18.291
praying to be rescued
by a merry band of soc...

40:27.469 --> 40:30.053
You know I won't let that happen.

40:30.105 --> 40:31.221
I found it!

40:33.108 --> 40:34.191
I found it!

40:40.365 --> 40:42.032
Okay, so, uh...

40:42.067 --> 40:43.984
you get in the... the freezer.

40:44.036 --> 40:45.402
The freezer takes you to the Realm,

40:45.454 --> 40:47.225
and that's basically
how you're going to...

40:47.225 --> 40:48.905
Oh, no, no, no. No.

40:49.291 --> 40:50.991
"Oh, no," what? What's "Oh, no?"

40:51.043 --> 40:53.076
I'm not going in, Holden Matthews.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.162
You are.

40:56.164 --> 40:57.998
Uh, come again, bro?

40:58.050 --> 40:59.082
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

40:59.134 --> 41:00.250
Hold up a damn second.

41:00.302 --> 41:02.252
We just busted you out,
so you could go...

41:02.304 --> 41:03.303
I can only show you how.

41:04.473 --> 41:06.089
But the actual journey? That...

41:06.141 --> 41:09.009
that privilege belongs to Holden...

41:09.011 --> 41:10.310
and Holden alone.

41:22.491 --> 41:24.407
Screw it.

41:26.495 --> 41:28.194
Let's do this.
