Sha-ha, dah.

01:18.828 --> 01:20.336
Broosk-da-da-da-boom.

01:20.337 --> 01:21.504
Shadeet-hamah.

01:33.395 --> 01:35.478
Brooks-dask-dask-da-boom.

01:44.337 --> 01:46.454
Milo-tamale-shakinee.

02:12.884 --> 02:14.825
You are a winner.

02:14.826 --> 02:16.585
You soar with the eagles.

02:16.586 --> 02:17.419
No.

02:17.420 --> 02:19.559
The eagles soar with you.

02:24.946 --> 02:25.779
Shit.

02:31.948 --> 02:34.698
I'm gonna be late for work again.

02:36.009 --> 02:40.342
I know I shouldn't have
stayed over on a work night.

02:41.289 --> 02:42.122
Did you hear me, babe?

02:42.123 --> 02:43.854
I'm gonna be late for work again.

02:43.855 --> 02:45.022
Bye jellybear.

02:46.893 --> 02:50.039
You are destined for greatness.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.587
You are a caterpillar
waiting to transform

02:52.588 --> 02:55.530
into a magnificent butterfly.

02:59.311 --> 03:01.990
He's so cute when he's sleeping.

03:01.991 --> 03:05.074
I'm gonna go start the coffee.
Okay.

03:12.047 --> 03:14.359
Your life has meaning.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.687
You are a king among
ordinary men.

03:16.688 --> 03:19.451
A king with a huge penis.

03:19.452 --> 03:21.338
A glorious penis.

03:21.339 --> 03:25.879
A penis that should be
praised and worshiped.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.682
Suagar-booger.

03:27.683 --> 03:29.649
My little astronaut.

03:29.650 --> 03:32.359
It's time to get up sleepy head.

03:34.543 --> 03:38.189
You can achieve
anything you set you mind to.

03:38.190 --> 03:41.107
Other men cower in your greatness.

03:45.438 --> 03:48.233
Come on, Matty,
breakfast is almost ready.

03:48.234 --> 03:49.835
If you were an animal,

03:49.836 --> 03:52.176
you would be a dinosaur.

03:52.177 --> 03:55.177
Matt, Honey, it's time to wake up.

03:59.915 --> 04:00.848
Whoa!

04:08.585 --> 04:09.766
Thanks, Shaniqua.

04:09.767 --> 04:11.434
I'm not even hungry.

04:25.808 --> 04:28.247
Every fucking morning.

04:28.248 --> 04:29.081
Come on.

04:31.426 --> 04:33.843
Oh, shit, holy chode balls.

04:35.608 --> 04:39.908
So sorry, Alexander, he's
gonna be a few more minutes.

04:39.909 --> 04:42.609
It's all right, Miss Gaye.

04:42.610 --> 04:43.810
There he is.

04:45.166 --> 04:47.584
Give your mom a kiss goodbye.

04:47.585 --> 04:48.918
Have a good day.

04:51.808 --> 04:53.486
Have a great day, sugar-booger.

04:53.487 --> 04:55.904
It's Matt to you, Shaniqua.

05:22.939 --> 05:24.320
You wanna just let
me borrow your car

05:24.321 --> 05:26.926
so you can stay here
and bang my mom?

05:26.927 --> 05:30.195
Do you know if your mom is
working tonight, sugar booger?

05:30.196 --> 05:31.047
Fuck off.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.721
I was watching Terminator
the other night, right.

05:36.722 --> 05:37.921
And not that new garbage.

05:37.922 --> 05:39.644
I'm talking about that classic shit.

05:39.645 --> 05:40.724
It got me thinking.

05:40.725 --> 05:45.308
What if I time travel back in
time as my 28-year-old self,

05:45.309 --> 05:46.935
and I found my 10-year-old self

05:46.936 --> 05:49.182
and I fucking jerked him off.

05:49.183 --> 05:52.926
Would that be molestation
or masturbation?

05:52.927 --> 05:54.927
I don't got time for your nonsense.

05:54.928 --> 05:58.345
I'm too busy being
employee of the month.

05:59.374 --> 06:01.319
Hey you two. Quit
giving each other FJs

06:01.320 --> 06:03.482
and get back to work.

06:03.483 --> 06:04.316
Idiots.

06:21.368 --> 06:23.959
Bro, bro, it's Jenna

06:34.874 --> 06:37.213
<i>♪ One hundid every
time you go away ♪</i>

06:37.214 --> 06:39.733
<i>♪ One hundid go on
and say my name ♪</i>

06:39.734 --> 06:42.535
<i>♪ One hundid if we
gonna make it last ♪</i>

06:42.536 --> 06:44.176
<i>♪ All I ever ask ♪</i>

06:44.177 --> 06:46.426
Here's your chance,
man, go talk to her.

06:46.427 --> 06:47.738
I can't just go talk to her.

06:47.739 --> 06:49.219
This is a workplace.

06:49.220 --> 06:50.276
Who cares?

06:50.277 --> 06:51.998
I'm so tired of listening
to you cry about

06:51.999 --> 06:53.906
not having a girl to cuddle with.

06:53.907 --> 06:55.099
Who cares?

06:55.100 --> 06:58.143
Uh, how about title seven
of the Civil Rights Act.

06:58.144 --> 07:00.592
Uh, how do you know that?

07:00.593 --> 07:01.855
Are you fucking kidding me?

07:01.856 --> 07:02.975
It's in the break room.

07:02.976 --> 07:04.240
And you know what
happens to people

07:04.241 --> 07:06.115
accused of sexual harassment?

07:06.116 --> 07:08.959
What, they hold a parade for them?

07:08.960 --> 07:10.374
Termination.

07:10.375 --> 07:13.062
Dude, they're not gonna
fire you for talking to her.

07:13.063 --> 07:14.742
Just go over there before she leaves.

07:14.743 --> 07:17.557
Stop being a little bitch.

07:17.558 --> 07:20.558
I'll buy you a beer after work.

07:20.559 --> 07:21.726
Make it two?

07:22.722 --> 07:24.055
Fine, just go.

07:27.849 --> 07:28.682
Dick.

07:30.464 --> 07:32.714
Nice files you got there.

07:33.991 --> 07:35.884
Do you work here?

07:35.885 --> 07:37.034
Seriously?

07:37.035 --> 07:39.042
I've worked here longer than you.

07:39.043 --> 07:41.770
Oh, so you're in like
shipping and receiving?

07:41.771 --> 07:42.604
What?

07:42.605 --> 07:45.406
No, I work right here in this office.

07:45.407 --> 07:47.848
I was sitting at my
desk when you walked in.

07:47.849 --> 07:49.445
You didn't see me?
Really?

07:49.446 --> 07:51.223
Yeah, I didn't see you.

07:51.224 --> 07:52.427
You didn't see me?

07:52.428 --> 07:54.390
I was like two inches away from you.

07:54.391 --> 07:56.351
And how do you not know I work here?

07:56.352 --> 07:58.030
I see you every single day.

07:58.031 --> 07:59.794
Wait, so you've been watching me?

07:59.795 --> 08:01.722
Like some kind of perverted stalker.

08:01.723 --> 08:03.504
You know that's sexual harassment?

08:03.505 --> 08:05.268
Sexual harassment?

08:05.269 --> 08:06.869
For seeing you come in?

08:06.870 --> 08:09.189
Maybe you should take yourself
on down to the break room

08:09.190 --> 08:10.472
and get a refresher course

08:10.473 --> 08:12.755
because that's not sexual harassment.

08:12.756 --> 08:13.589
Hmm.

08:14.431 --> 08:15.314
What's up, Jenna?

08:15.315 --> 08:17.957
Oh, hey, Matt.
Seriously?

08:17.958 --> 08:19.638
We actually have to go, I'm sorry.

08:19.639 --> 08:22.472
Alex is having a family emergency.

08:25.106 --> 08:27.865
How the hell does Jenna
know who you are and not me?

08:27.866 --> 08:28.706
I don't know.

08:28.707 --> 08:32.586
Maybe because I'm not
a perverted stalker.

08:32.587 --> 08:35.604
Well if it isn't the two
biggest vaginas in the office.

08:35.605 --> 08:38.352
I knew I'd find you two in
here circle jerking each other.

08:38.354 --> 08:39.905
So we have vaginas,

08:39.907 --> 08:42.190
or we're jerking each other's dicks off?

08:42.191 --> 08:43.751
I'm confused.

08:43.751 --> 08:44.585
Both.

08:44.586 --> 08:46.752
You fucking gender ninjas.

08:47.638 --> 08:49.848
You know what, fuck
you, I got shit to do.

08:49.849 --> 08:51.907
What the hell, man?

08:53.731 --> 08:57.148
You gonna do something about it, pussy?

09:00.345 --> 09:01.998
That's what I thought.

09:16.370 --> 09:19.412
Oh, you got to be fist fucking me, man.

09:19.413 --> 09:20.330
What now?

09:21.173 --> 09:24.311
Oh nothing, I'm just having
PTSD flashbacks, you know,

09:24.312 --> 09:25.473
remembering that time you were

09:25.474 --> 09:28.353
talking to Jenna at the office.

09:28.354 --> 09:29.992
Made yourself look like a dumb idiot.

09:29.993 --> 09:32.240
Remember that?
Fuck off.

09:32.241 --> 09:33.643
I don't understand
how you're so horrible

09:33.644 --> 09:35.003
at talking to women.

09:35.004 --> 09:37.166
It's like watching one
of those shitty Novelas.

09:37.167 --> 09:38.545
All Novelas are shitty,

09:38.546 --> 09:40.788
and you wouldn't have done any better.

09:40.789 --> 09:41.732
Fucking right I would have.

09:41.733 --> 09:44.493
Compared to you I'm
like Zac Efron's cock.

09:44.494 --> 09:45.327
Yeah, whatever.

09:45.328 --> 09:48.189
If you're so smooth,
let's see you do better.

09:48.190 --> 09:50.273
Challenge accepted ese.

09:52.254 --> 09:54.415
Can I get you guys a refill?

09:54.416 --> 09:57.135
Actually, I was wondering
if you might possibly know

09:57.136 --> 10:00.037
the difference between me and my couch?

10:00.038 --> 10:02.797
One's more fun to sit on than the other.

10:02.798 --> 10:03.900
Sort of.

10:03.901 --> 10:06.155
The real difference
between me and my couch

10:06.156 --> 10:07.989
is my couch pulls out.

10:10.266 --> 10:12.508
So can I get you guys another drink?

10:12.509 --> 10:14.926
Six shots of vodka de nada.

10:17.047 --> 10:18.449
Nice.

10:18.450 --> 10:20.451
A dirty joke and a drink order.

10:20.452 --> 10:22.212
You're a real lady's man.

10:22.213 --> 10:23.534
I'm sorry I doubted you.

10:23.535 --> 10:25.880
Your moms would be so proud.

10:25.881 --> 10:28.548
Just wait for it, wait for it.

10:43.570 --> 10:44.403
Ah, snap.

10:46.032 --> 10:47.369
Told you.

10:47.370 --> 10:49.370
You probably know her.

10:50.940 --> 10:53.516
Ah, come on, I wasn't even ready dude.

10:53.517 --> 10:54.984
I don't care.

10:59.913 --> 11:01.317
Six more shots.

11:26.330 --> 11:29.950
Gross, I think you got some on me.

11:29.951 --> 11:33.152
You know, I can't even
wrap my brain around

11:33.153 --> 11:37.755
the fact that you are so
horrible at talking to chicks.

11:37.756 --> 11:40.799
Look at you, you're like an
Abercrombie model over here.

11:40.800 --> 11:43.959
You should be banging
bitches every single day

11:43.960 --> 11:47.043
and every single night and afternoon.

11:47.926 --> 11:50.685
Well it's not easy
for me to talk to women

11:50.686 --> 11:52.647
like it is for you.

11:52.648 --> 11:54.409
I'm not surrounded by a hot girlfriend

11:54.410 --> 11:57.219
and hot stripper moms 24/7

11:57.220 --> 12:01.911
who wipe the tip of my penis
every time I take a piss.

12:01.912 --> 12:03.748
Fuck you dude.

12:03.749 --> 12:06.512
I told you a million times,
my mom is not a stripper,

12:06.513 --> 12:09.847
she's an exotic dancer and a saint.

12:10.394 --> 12:12.733
And I don't even want
to hear this shit, man.

12:12.734 --> 12:14.375
Look at you.

12:14.376 --> 12:18.740
I would give both nuts and
the sack to have your life.

12:18.741 --> 12:20.781
You can run a billion miles,

12:20.782 --> 12:23.944
you get to wear all this stylish
clothes, and most of all,

12:23.945 --> 12:26.038
you're not smothered like I am.

12:26.039 --> 12:28.817
Well, I'd do the same to have your life.

12:28.818 --> 12:32.941
You have a girlfriend
and a mom, two moms,

12:32.942 --> 12:36.302
that love you, you're never lonely

12:36.303 --> 12:39.386
and you get to eat whatever you want.

12:45.470 --> 12:49.970
That there is a bum with
his hand on his hobo balls.

12:51.315 --> 12:54.499
Day-bu gah-boos-uhn
day-boos-uhn-go.

12:54.500 --> 12:55.404
Bay-tah.

12:55.405 --> 12:57.987
Queta-su-noba day-boos-uhn-dah.

12:59.704 --> 13:01.145
God damn it.

13:01.146 --> 13:02.504
What the fuck?

13:04.133 --> 13:05.515
Dude I'm gonna get AIDS!

13:31.265 --> 13:32.464
Whoa.

13:32.465 --> 13:34.882
Somebody's up early this morning.

13:34.883 --> 13:36.981
I slept here last night?

13:36.982 --> 13:39.040
I don't remember coming over.

13:39.041 --> 13:42.641
It sounds like you had too
much to drink last night.

13:42.642 --> 13:44.125
Where's, where's Matt?

13:44.983 --> 13:46.483
Is he down stairs?

14:05.995 --> 14:07.874
What the fuck.

14:07.875 --> 14:08.708
I'm Matt?

14:15.556 --> 14:18.789
Hey, Ms. Gaye, who do you think I am?

14:19.912 --> 14:21.657
You're so funny Matty.

14:21.658 --> 14:22.741
Are you okay?

14:23.880 --> 14:25.213
What the fuck?

14:26.709 --> 14:29.092
Oh, shit, I really am Matt.

14:49.954 --> 14:50.787
Alex.

14:54.645 --> 14:55.478
Alex.

14:57.934 --> 15:00.542
Did you see where I put my phone?

15:00.543 --> 15:02.624
I need to call my mom.

15:02.625 --> 15:05.292
She's probably worried about me.

15:07.071 --> 15:07.904
Alex.

15:09.273 --> 15:14.190
Yo, I need to let her know I
spent the night at your house.

15:38.905 --> 15:40.530
The fuck?

15:54.129 --> 15:56.421
Am I high right now?

15:58.138 --> 16:02.030
I don't remember doing
any drugs last night.

16:06.047 --> 16:06.880
Ah.

16:08.208 --> 16:09.041
What?

16:26.951 --> 16:28.473
Nice bike, fat ass.

16:28.474 --> 16:31.568
I'm surprised your tires
haven't exploded.

16:31.569 --> 16:33.476
Good one, Vir-Gina.

16:33.477 --> 16:36.159
We have the same bike dumb-ass.

16:36.160 --> 16:40.323
It's Virgil, asshole and I
don't have that faggy basket.

16:40.324 --> 16:42.325
Why don't you take
your bitch ass back home

16:42.326 --> 16:44.206
before I shit on Matt's porch again,

16:44.207 --> 16:48.790
blame you and watch your
whore of a mom whoop your ass.

16:51.347 --> 16:53.388
No, I won't put my hands down your pants

16:53.389 --> 16:55.312
and play with your tiny dick.

16:55.313 --> 16:57.724
Leave me alone, Jared from Subway.

16:57.725 --> 16:59.686
Hey man, you get away from that kid.

16:59.687 --> 17:01.251
Tiny dick.

17:01.252 --> 17:02.085
Oh shit.

17:12.347 --> 17:16.097
I fucking knew it,
dude, get out of my way.

17:18.709 --> 17:20.188
What the hell is going on, dude?

17:20.189 --> 17:22.559
Why am I in your Ethiopian body?

17:22.560 --> 17:24.105
I don't know, why don't you tell me?

17:24.106 --> 17:26.271
I just rode here on
your mom's gay ass bike

17:26.271 --> 17:28.676
in this fat ass Jabba
the Hutt body you have.

17:28.677 --> 17:30.441
Have you ever done
a day of cardio

17:30.442 --> 17:32.231
in your entire fucking life?

17:32.232 --> 17:35.636
I find it and honor to
resemble Jabba Desilijic Tiure.

17:35.637 --> 17:40.484
One of the most notorious
crime lords in the galaxy.

17:40.485 --> 17:42.049
The hell are you talking about?

17:42.050 --> 17:46.058
Jabba Desilijic Tiure aka Jabba the Hutt

17:46.532 --> 17:48.056
or the Bloated one.

17:48.057 --> 17:48.890
Seriously?

17:50.019 --> 17:53.825
First introduced in 1983
with the third installment

17:53.826 --> 17:58.826
of the original Star Wars
trilogy, Return of the Jedi.

17:59.074 --> 17:59.954
No?

17:59.955 --> 18:01.120
Got the little Ewoks,

18:01.121 --> 18:02.766
they look like little George Lucas's.

18:02.767 --> 18:04.301
I swear, sometimes you're the smartest

18:04.302 --> 18:07.624
mentally handicap person that I know.

18:07.625 --> 18:10.553
Is there a god damn reason
why my AC's not on right now?

18:10.554 --> 18:13.356
My balls are sweaty and they're
like sticking to my ankles.

18:13.357 --> 18:14.648
What are you talking about?

18:14.649 --> 18:16.136
It's freezing in here.

18:16.137 --> 18:19.704
Your nipples are fucking
hard as fuck right now.

18:19.705 --> 18:20.679
Yeah.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.320
So what are we gonna do?

18:22.321 --> 18:24.303
You figure out what switched us yet?

18:24.304 --> 18:26.065
I'm thinking.

18:26.066 --> 18:28.274
Well think faster you're the smart one.

18:28.275 --> 18:29.359
Will you shut the hell up?

18:29.360 --> 18:30.660
I'm trying to concentrate.

18:30.661 --> 18:31.494
Jesus.

18:32.524 --> 18:33.603
Okay.

18:33.604 --> 18:35.563
So we went to work.

18:35.564 --> 18:38.173
We stopped by the bar afterward.

18:38.948 --> 18:41.448
You puked like a little bitch.

18:43.032 --> 18:44.873
Obviously the bum.

18:44.874 --> 18:46.295
The one that slapped us.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.452
It had to be him.

18:48.453 --> 18:50.578
Oh yeah, right.

18:50.579 --> 18:52.162
That mother fucker.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.933
Well let's go find him and
make him switch us back.

18:55.934 --> 18:56.767
Come on.

18:57.659 --> 18:58.492
Skedaddle.

19:21.001 --> 19:22.179
Oh, come on!

19:31.359 --> 19:33.501
Dude, we crashed.

19:33.502 --> 19:35.143
What the fuck?

19:35.144 --> 19:36.369
Did you hit someone?

19:36.370 --> 19:37.308
Dude, pay attention.

19:37.309 --> 19:41.625
I'm not gonna be the only one
looking for this guy, okay.

19:47.158 --> 19:49.143
Oh shit, Kratos.

19:49.144 --> 19:50.384
You know that guy?

19:50.385 --> 19:52.086
Ah, yeah, he's my dealer.

19:52.087 --> 19:53.525
I told you about him before.

19:53.526 --> 19:54.624
No.

19:54.625 --> 19:55.458
Come on.

19:55.459 --> 19:57.999
He probably knows that
fuck that slapped us.

20:02.670 --> 20:05.357
What the fuck's is this guy's problem?

20:05.358 --> 20:06.957
Just pretend like you're me.

20:06.958 --> 20:09.084
Kratos, it's me Matt.

20:09.085 --> 20:11.652
I buy pot from you homebroski.

20:12.557 --> 20:13.536
Calm down.

20:13.537 --> 20:14.874
This is my friend Ma...

20:14.875 --> 20:16.600
This is my friend Alex.

20:16.601 --> 20:18.520
I know who you are.

20:18.521 --> 20:21.209
You think you could steal Matt's face

20:21.210 --> 20:24.270
and then come up on my
corner and deal drugs?

20:24.271 --> 20:25.817
What?

20:25.818 --> 20:27.977
I knew about your machine.

20:27.978 --> 20:31.496
Takes someone's face and
then puts on someone else's.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.856
We didn't steal anybody's face.

20:33.857 --> 20:35.273
We just came here to ask you a question

20:35.274 --> 20:36.724
about one of your friends.

20:36.725 --> 20:39.276
How do you know about my friends?

20:40.251 --> 20:42.611
I don't got any bum friends.

20:42.612 --> 20:44.836
Now get out of here.

20:44.837 --> 20:47.520
This is my empire.

20:48.287 --> 20:50.703
You can't have it.

20:54.190 --> 20:57.435
Kratos, look into my eyes, man.

20:57.436 --> 20:59.239
It's me Matt.

20:59.240 --> 21:00.725
My buddy Alex and I were here last night

21:00.726 --> 21:04.213
when some bum who walks around
with his hands down his pants

21:04.214 --> 21:07.180
caressing his nuts, slapped
both of us in the face.

21:07.181 --> 21:10.396
And by some weird voodoo
or magic or some shit,

21:10.397 --> 21:11.920
we switched bodies.

21:11.921 --> 21:14.286
He's me and I'm him.

21:14.287 --> 21:17.009
And we just want to switch
and get our own bodies back.

21:17.010 --> 21:19.188
Now can you help us?

21:19.189 --> 21:21.797
Matt, my man.

21:22.191 --> 21:25.049
Why didn't you tell me in
the first place, my brotha?

21:28.334 --> 21:29.576
Not this guy again.

21:29.577 --> 21:31.910
I see you've met Joe Blow.

21:33.142 --> 21:35.559
Is he sucking his own dick?

21:37.386 --> 21:38.553
Lucky bastard.

21:41.109 --> 21:43.075
Ah, what the hell man?

21:43.076 --> 21:43.909
Get off of me.

21:43.910 --> 21:46.701
I am so sorry.

21:48.717 --> 21:49.984
Hey, Kratos.

21:50.494 --> 21:52.508
This is Steve.

21:52.509 --> 21:55.432
He's been diagnosed
with this rare disease

21:55.433 --> 21:58.250
called Alien Hand Syndrome.

21:58.914 --> 22:01.994
He's got no control over his right arm.

22:01.995 --> 22:05.951
I told him it's proof that aliens exist,

22:05.952 --> 22:08.285
and I offered to cut it off.

22:10.657 --> 22:12.424
But he won't let me.

22:19.617 --> 22:22.673
Do you guys know the bum
we're talking about or what?

22:22.674 --> 22:25.597
Yeah, I know about the
guy you're looking for.

22:25.598 --> 22:27.598
His name's Magic Mike.

22:27.599 --> 22:30.315
He comes around every Friday

22:32.246 --> 22:34.079
to get the recyclables

22:34.966 --> 22:37.049
before the garbage comes.

22:38.337 --> 22:41.250
Is he jerking you off right now?

22:41.251 --> 22:43.168
Just go with it, bro.

22:45.473 --> 22:48.307
I think we got the
answers we're looking for.

22:48.308 --> 22:49.850
Hey wait.

22:49.851 --> 22:51.652
Don't you guys want to buy something?

22:51.653 --> 22:54.220
I just got in some real goodies.

22:54.221 --> 22:55.971
No man, we're good.

22:58.548 --> 22:59.381
Oh.

23:03.539 --> 23:05.013
Oh, god. Oh.

23:14.422 --> 23:16.097
I am so sorry.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.507
I'm not.

23:24.791 --> 23:27.913
I cannot believe I'm gonna
be stuck in this body tonight.

23:27.914 --> 23:29.774
Bitch please.

23:29.775 --> 23:31.857
You get to eat snacks and play Xbox

23:31.858 --> 23:34.669
while my mom and girlfriend spoil you.

23:34.670 --> 23:36.729
And why in the hell would I do that?

23:36.730 --> 23:38.649
Because you're me.

23:38.650 --> 23:39.483
So?

23:39.484 --> 23:43.082
So we have to pretend
like we're each other.

23:43.083 --> 23:45.540
What, why?
Seriously?

23:45.541 --> 23:48.439
You honestly think anyone
besides my drugged out dealer

23:48.440 --> 23:51.721
is gonna believe us if we
tell them we switched bodies?

23:51.722 --> 23:53.922
I'm gonna go with no.

23:53.923 --> 23:58.923
They're more likely to lock
us away in some creepy asylum.

23:59.086 --> 24:01.086
You know I hate asylums.

24:02.771 --> 24:05.080
I guess you have a point.

24:05.081 --> 24:06.738
You're fucking right I do.

24:06.739 --> 24:07.778
Fine, whatever.

24:07.779 --> 24:10.529
Lets just get this over with man.

24:11.819 --> 24:14.236
Shit, Holly's already here.

24:15.106 --> 24:17.348
What's the protocol on that anyway?

24:17.349 --> 24:19.596
If she comes on to me, do I hit that or?

24:19.597 --> 24:21.219
She's definitely gonna come on to you

24:21.220 --> 24:22.676
and you're not gonna do a damn thing.

24:22.677 --> 24:24.729
You're gonna shut that shit down.

24:24.730 --> 24:26.649
Whatever it takes.

24:26.650 --> 24:28.330
I understand it's been a while

24:28.331 --> 24:30.716
since you felt a woman's touch,

24:30.717 --> 24:33.043
but you better not do anything man.

24:33.044 --> 24:33.926
All right, all right.

24:33.927 --> 24:35.343
Jesus, calm down.

24:37.076 --> 24:38.435
What's this?

24:38.436 --> 24:41.236
That is your itinerary for the week.

24:41.237 --> 24:43.641
I don't even know what
half these exercises are.

24:43.642 --> 24:46.059
And raw foods?

24:47.204 --> 24:49.183
You know I'm not gonna
eat this shit, right?

24:49.184 --> 24:50.542
You are gonna eat that shit

24:50.543 --> 24:53.626
or Holly's gonna be eating this dick.

25:25.292 --> 25:27.091
This mother fucking guy.

25:27.092 --> 25:27.925
Fuck.

25:30.899 --> 25:32.149
Chubby bunny.

25:35.703 --> 25:36.536
No.

25:42.158 --> 25:43.238
What's wrong baby?

25:43.239 --> 25:46.082
I'm just not in the mood, okay?

25:46.083 --> 25:48.035
Not according to Mr. Action Jackson!

25:48.036 --> 25:48.939
Action Jackson?

25:54.927 --> 25:57.594
I need to answer the door, okay?

26:00.942 --> 26:02.654
What the fuck do you
think you're doing, dude?

26:02.655 --> 26:04.068
What?
Don't what me.

26:04.069 --> 26:07.215
I saw you grabbing her dick.

26:07.216 --> 26:08.217
Her grabbing your dick.

26:08.218 --> 26:09.454
You know what the fuck I meant.

26:09.455 --> 26:10.848
She was grabbing your dick actually,

26:10.849 --> 26:12.616
and she was the one all over me.

26:12.617 --> 26:16.200
Whatever, just give
me the damn car keys.

26:17.117 --> 26:18.755
You're a real asshole, you know that?

26:18.756 --> 26:20.755
I'm telling you the truth.

26:20.756 --> 26:23.756
It wasn't me, it was Action Jackson.

26:28.720 --> 26:33.078
Yeah, I'm gonna eat
real healthy all right.

26:41.361 --> 26:43.361
Do you have any sixes?

26:47.371 --> 26:48.260
No.

26:48.261 --> 26:49.794
I mean go fish.

26:52.240 --> 26:53.666
Okay.

26:53.667 --> 26:56.542
Do you have any jacks?

26:57.055 --> 26:57.888
Yep.

26:59.045 --> 27:03.283
You know, we should really
switch this to strip go fish.

27:03.284 --> 27:06.593
No, I think we should
stick to the regular go fish.

27:06.594 --> 27:07.427
Please.

27:16.067 --> 27:18.808
What the fuck, motha fucka?

27:19.133 --> 27:21.048
Did you just talk?

27:21.049 --> 27:23.929
Fuck yeah, I said what the fuck?

27:24.371 --> 27:26.732
Alex tries to fuck your girl

27:26.733 --> 27:29.940
and you're just gonna
eat a fucking pizza?

27:29.941 --> 27:32.641
Bitch move motha fucka.

27:32.642 --> 27:36.780
Yeah, well what the fuck
do you suggest then, asshole?

27:36.781 --> 27:39.979
You gotta fucking eat everything.

27:39.980 --> 27:41.019
Everything?

27:41.020 --> 27:45.378
Fucking every motha
fucking thing, motha fucka.

27:46.106 --> 27:48.425
Do you have any fives?

27:48.426 --> 27:49.259
Go fish.

27:50.496 --> 27:53.529
Uhm, do you have any eights?

27:56.340 --> 27:57.897
No, go fish.

28:27.088 --> 28:29.169
That's it, I'm gonna kill him.

28:29.170 --> 28:30.051
Where are you going?

28:30.051 --> 28:31.005
What's going on?

28:31.006 --> 28:33.619
I'm going to my, I'm
going to Alex's house.

28:33.620 --> 28:34.453
Why?

28:34.454 --> 28:36.304
Because I'm gonna kick
the shit out of him.

28:36.305 --> 28:39.938
Okay, well before you go
can I get a kiss at least?

28:39.939 --> 28:41.298
Uh, sure.

28:47.747 --> 28:49.083
I love you chubby bunny.

28:49.084 --> 28:52.009
I love you too my thin bunny.

29:04.243 --> 29:06.283
I'm gonna kick your fucking teeth in.

29:07.843 --> 29:08.676
What?

29:10.353 --> 29:13.735
I said, go ahead, they're your teeth.

29:13.736 --> 29:14.966
Motherfucker!

29:14.967 --> 29:16.467
I can't breathe.

29:17.708 --> 29:18.803
It wasn't me.

29:18.804 --> 29:21.787
It was the oven mitt's idea, tell him.

29:21.788 --> 29:23.705
You mother fucking rat.

29:26.163 --> 29:26.996
Help.

29:28.859 --> 29:29.692
Puke it up.

29:29.693 --> 29:31.405
Get off me Kevin Spacey.

29:31.406 --> 29:32.721
Puke it up.
Rape!

29:32.722 --> 29:33.972
He's raping me!

29:35.045 --> 29:38.964
Puke it up or I'm gonna
make you puke it up.

29:50.474 --> 29:52.391
Now clean yourself off.

30:15.883 --> 30:18.889
So you really didn't diddle my girl?

30:18.890 --> 30:21.561
No, like I said, she ambushed me.

30:21.562 --> 30:22.683
She fucking jumped on me.

30:22.684 --> 30:24.550
I had to fight just to get away.

30:24.551 --> 30:29.359
It's not my fault your body
is so irresistibly sexy.

30:29.360 --> 30:32.688
And you haven't been
doing anything since I left?

30:32.689 --> 30:33.612
Hell no.

30:33.613 --> 30:37.524
We've just been playing go fish
like two real mature adults.

30:37.525 --> 30:39.826
Man, Holly always kicks
my ass at that game.

30:39.827 --> 30:42.585
Yeah, that's 'cause you suck.

30:43.938 --> 30:47.071
Oh yeah, I made you a new itinerary.

30:47.072 --> 30:49.060
How about you try
following it this time,

30:49.061 --> 30:50.882
instead of throwing it away.

30:50.883 --> 30:52.484
I'm not gonna throw it away.

30:52.485 --> 30:54.188
Yeah, like you didn't throw
away the crinkled up one

30:54.189 --> 30:56.575
I found in your driveway.

30:56.576 --> 30:57.777
Can you wash that shit off my face

30:57.778 --> 30:59.903
so I don't break out with pimples?

30:59.904 --> 31:02.778
And please, please for the love of god,

31:02.779 --> 31:05.248
will you stop eating junk
food while you're in my body.

31:05.249 --> 31:06.763
Can you do that?

31:06.764 --> 31:07.597
Fine.

31:16.439 --> 31:17.726
Bitch.

31:37.303 --> 31:39.479
Best night of sleep, ever.

31:41.845 --> 31:43.830
Good morning my little astronaut.

31:43.831 --> 31:46.034
You forgot to put your sleep
mask on again last night

31:46.035 --> 31:49.452
so I put it on you
while you were asleep.

31:52.922 --> 31:54.955
I wish you would've told me Ms. Gaye.

31:54.956 --> 31:56.549
This damn thing freaks me out.

31:56.550 --> 31:58.531
Ms. Gaye?

31:58.532 --> 32:00.032
Very funny, Matty.

32:04.844 --> 32:06.181
What's that?

32:06.182 --> 32:07.349
What's what?

32:09.066 --> 32:12.316
Oh, nothing, I thought I saw a ghost.

32:14.816 --> 32:17.201
Queeri.
Hey there cock boy.

32:17.202 --> 32:18.035
Make me a pizza.

32:18.036 --> 32:19.561
Oh fuck yeah.

32:19.562 --> 32:23.562
One dirty little pizza
coming right up cock boy.

32:25.956 --> 32:27.196
Oh fuck yeah.

32:27.197 --> 32:30.947
How's that pizza taste
there little cock boy?

32:35.449 --> 32:36.282
Hurry up and get ready.

32:36.283 --> 32:38.199
Alex will be here soon.

32:45.516 --> 32:48.369
Can you put some damn
clothes on Miss, mom.

32:48.370 --> 32:50.167
I'm trying to get ready for work.

32:50.168 --> 32:52.889
What honey?

32:52.890 --> 32:53.723
No.

32:53.724 --> 32:56.416
Hey let me in on this action.

32:56.417 --> 32:57.250
Shaniqua.

32:57.251 --> 32:58.922
Oh do you need some privacy?

32:58.923 --> 33:00.298
Get off-get off.

33:00.747 --> 33:02.873
Someone's a grumpy butt this morning.

33:02.874 --> 33:06.957
I think you may have
drooled last night, Matty.

33:11.996 --> 33:13.115
Whoa.

33:13.116 --> 33:15.783
Those are some funky balls, son.

33:17.759 --> 33:19.413
Ah, whatever.

Ah, yeah.

34:13.266 --> 34:15.106
Have a good day today, sugar booger.

34:15.107 --> 34:15.940
You too.

34:19.774 --> 34:21.524
Fuck you, Shaniqua.

34:29.097 --> 34:30.578
The hell is this?

34:30.579 --> 34:31.411
Nice, right?

34:31.413 --> 34:34.429
It's an exact replica
of Taylor Swift's mouth.

34:34.431 --> 34:36.206
It's to help you take the edge off.

34:36.206 --> 34:40.686
You know, so you don't try
and fuck my girlfriend.

34:40.687 --> 34:41.520
Thanks.

34:42.905 --> 34:45.567
Not in my body pothead.

34:45.568 --> 34:46.400
Asshole.

34:57.258 --> 35:00.298
Thank you ladies and
gentleman for showing up.

35:00.299 --> 35:03.005
Can't believe we have
a sold out show today.

35:03.006 --> 35:05.261
Although I'm not a fan
of your health care plan

35:05.262 --> 35:09.261
I do appreciate President
Obama for coming to see me.

35:09.262 --> 35:13.125
Speaking of health, I
obviously have none.

35:13.126 --> 35:15.306
Will you at least pretend
to work while you're me?

35:15.307 --> 35:16.868
I don't have time for that.

35:16.869 --> 35:18.362
You do realize that the comedy contest

35:18.363 --> 35:20.286
is in a few days, right?

35:20.287 --> 35:21.211
Yes.

35:21.212 --> 35:22.892
And do you realize there's a big chance

35:22.893 --> 35:26.053
we'll still be in each
other's bodies by then?

35:26.054 --> 35:28.617
Fuck, you're right.

35:28.618 --> 35:31.984
Well then, you're just gonna
have to do the contest for me.

35:31.985 --> 35:32.818
Nope.

35:34.562 --> 35:35.683
No.

35:35.684 --> 35:36.669
No no no no.

35:36.670 --> 35:38.511
I didn't sign up for that bullshit.

35:38.512 --> 35:40.151
You're gonna have to cancel.

35:40.152 --> 35:42.534
I don't do big crowds.

35:42.535 --> 35:45.177
Besides, you can re-enter
next year anyway.

35:45.178 --> 35:47.621
Get over yourself you damn drama queen.

35:47.622 --> 35:49.782
You do presentations
all the time at work

35:49.783 --> 35:51.262
and you seem to do just fine.

35:51.263 --> 35:52.384
There's a huge difference.

35:52.385 --> 35:54.253
There's only a handful of
people who actually work here,

35:54.254 --> 35:56.215
most of them we hate.

35:56.216 --> 35:58.138
When I'm doing presentations
I'm not attempting

35:58.139 --> 36:00.321
to make a huge crowd laugh.

36:00.322 --> 36:02.545
What if I freeze?

36:02.546 --> 36:04.465
Or they hate me?

36:04.466 --> 36:06.868
I'm not trying to make
a fool out of myself.

36:06.869 --> 36:11.058
Relax, if anything you'll
be making a fool out of me.

36:11.059 --> 36:14.591
I already given you my
body, my secret weapon.

36:14.592 --> 36:16.991
Now here are the bullets.

36:16.992 --> 36:17.992
My material.

36:18.832 --> 36:19.665
Read it,

36:20.282 --> 36:21.115
live it,

36:22.355 --> 36:23.188
be it.

36:27.634 --> 36:30.717
I really don't think I can do this.

36:32.850 --> 36:34.218
How about this,

36:34.219 --> 36:35.698
you stop being a smelly clit

36:35.699 --> 36:37.338
and do this competition for me

36:37.339 --> 36:38.980
and I'll get you a date with Jenna.

36:38.981 --> 36:40.802
I'll get her all wet and juicy for you

36:40.803 --> 36:43.200
so when we switch and
get our bodies back

36:43.201 --> 36:47.300
all you have to do is
slip the tip right in.

36:47.301 --> 36:48.500
Yeah.

36:48.501 --> 36:49.701
How does that sound?

36:49.702 --> 36:51.516
Give your hand a night off for once.

36:51.517 --> 36:54.684
It's a little graphic, but enticing.

36:55.961 --> 36:56.842
How about this?

36:56.843 --> 36:59.522
You get me the date with
Jenna while staying in shape

36:59.523 --> 37:01.282
until I get my body back.

37:01.283 --> 37:04.083
I actually have a respectable
competition coming up.

37:04.084 --> 37:05.615
It's called a triathlon.

37:05.616 --> 37:07.456
You probably have no clue what that is

37:07.457 --> 37:09.697
considering it involves
physical exercise

37:09.698 --> 37:10.898
but you're gonna need to learn,

37:10.899 --> 37:13.458
because you're probably
gonna have to do it for me.

37:13.459 --> 37:16.939
All right, and if you
help shed a few pounds,

37:16.940 --> 37:19.440
I think we can seal this deal.

37:26.703 --> 37:28.011
Come on, man.

37:31.397 --> 37:33.146
Hey you two retards,

37:33.147 --> 37:34.747
quit finger diddling
each other's urethras

37:34.748 --> 37:36.267
and get back to work.

37:36.268 --> 37:38.720
Alex, I need you to
start with this and then,

37:38.721 --> 37:40.240
I said Alex.

37:40.241 --> 37:43.408
And then get back to your other tasks.

37:44.250 --> 37:45.500
What is this?

37:46.936 --> 37:48.269
Is this cocaine?

37:56.591 --> 38:01.591
If anyone asks, I was with
you two fucktards last night.

38:01.936 --> 38:05.516
Hey boss, hanging out
with that white girl, huh?

38:05.517 --> 38:08.076
Classy, classy, I would partake

38:08.077 --> 38:11.319
but I'm currently doing
a full body cleanse.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.884
I love those scrumptious shakes.

38:13.885 --> 38:16.124
If you mention white girl

38:16.125 --> 38:19.165
or say the word scrumptious again,

38:19.166 --> 38:20.768
I'll fucking kill you.

38:20.769 --> 38:21.769
Now get back to work.

38:21.770 --> 38:26.569
There's shit smeared all over
the bathroom walls again.

38:26.570 --> 38:28.211
It was me.

38:30.220 --> 38:32.387
I wasn't done with that.

38:33.949 --> 38:35.766
Look at these two anus clowns blowing

38:35.767 --> 38:38.531
each other's dicks like animal balloons.

38:38.532 --> 38:40.131
You do know they don't actually

38:40.132 --> 38:43.371
blow on your dick when
you get a blowjob, right?

38:43.372 --> 38:45.505
Have you ever even gotten head before?

38:45.506 --> 38:48.105
No shit, I've had literally millions

38:48.106 --> 38:49.764
of blow jays in my life.

38:49.765 --> 38:51.848
You mean blowgays?

38:51.849 --> 38:53.570
We don't have time for
your shit today Chad,

38:53.571 --> 38:54.988
so fuck off.

38:56.613 --> 39:00.491
Where did you get the balls
to step up to me, civilian?

39:00.492 --> 39:04.459
You have no idea the
shit I saw over there.

39:11.157 --> 39:14.598
You're not even close to being
on my level you little bitch.

39:14.599 --> 39:18.691
I used to laugh at weak ass
chumps like you in boot camp.

39:18.692 --> 39:19.525
Yeah?

39:19.526 --> 39:20.910
Did you laugh at yourself
when they booted

39:20.911 --> 39:23.830
your bitch ass out of boot camp?

39:23.831 --> 39:24.990
That's right.

39:24.991 --> 39:27.991
I know all about your Swiss
cheese heart full of holes.

39:27.992 --> 39:30.591
So why don't you and your faulty heart

39:30.592 --> 39:32.625
murmur the fuck out of here.

39:37.332 --> 39:41.211
Yeah, look at Mr. Big
shot over here, huh.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.045
Fuck you and fuck you.

39:44.895 --> 39:49.057
Jesus, you know I got you guys this job?

39:49.058 --> 39:50.641
I can fire you too.

39:51.899 --> 39:54.898
I'm actually the one
that got you this job.

39:54.899 --> 39:58.232
And you can't fire us, you're a janitor.

39:59.429 --> 40:02.908
I'm a fucking custodian level two.

40:02.909 --> 40:05.326
There's a difference ass hat.

40:06.845 --> 40:07.678
What is this?

40:07.679 --> 40:09.764
I'm getting it from both sides now?

40:09.765 --> 40:10.857
You want some?

40:10.858 --> 40:15.174
No, I'm just saying I got you the job.

40:17.201 --> 40:19.692
Whatever, I have to go.

40:19.693 --> 40:23.408
Apparently I'm the only one
who actually works around here.

40:24.108 --> 40:26.050
But I'll be over at
your house later Matt,

40:26.051 --> 40:30.268
to motorboat your
mom's fat tittaayyys.

40:30.969 --> 40:34.852
I think you mean your
aunt's tits, you sick fuck.

40:37.408 --> 40:39.491
Bro, it's Jenna.

40:49.569 --> 40:51.848
<i>♪ One hundid every time you go away ♪</i>

40:51.849 --> 40:54.288
<i>♪ One hundid go on and say my name ♪</i>

40:54.289 --> 40:56.930
<i>♪ One hundid if we gonna make it last ♪</i>

40:56.931 --> 40:58.763
Here's your chance player.

40:58.764 --> 41:01.547
It's pronounced play-a.

41:08.616 --> 41:09.449
Playa.

41:15.345 --> 41:18.425
Hey, prettiest lady in this office.

41:18.426 --> 41:20.867
I'm the only lady in this office.

41:20.868 --> 41:21.701
I know.

41:33.143 --> 41:35.182
So, what happened?

41:35.183 --> 41:39.266
Oh wait let me guess, you
messed it up, as usual.

41:39.856 --> 41:41.760
Looks like you better start working out,

41:41.761 --> 41:44.525
you obese son of a bitch.

41:44.526 --> 41:47.026
You actually got her number?

41:53.815 --> 41:55.935
Hey there little guy.

41:55.936 --> 41:57.910
Looks like you were so
excited for our date tonight

41:57.911 --> 42:00.161
that you woke up before me.

42:01.033 --> 42:02.633
Be patient buddy,

42:02.634 --> 42:04.317
I know Alex beats you
with his hand every night

42:04.318 --> 42:07.398
until you throw up but I promise,

42:07.399 --> 42:12.399
I'ma take you to VagTown if
it's the last thing I do.

42:13.955 --> 42:16.939
All right, I know there's some muscles

42:16.940 --> 42:20.037
deep down in this fat
somewhere to stretch out.

42:47.909 --> 42:48.742
Yes.

42:49.629 --> 42:50.462
Yes.

42:54.797 --> 42:58.573
How does this mother
fucker not have a girlfriend?

43:04.515 --> 43:05.878
Yee-haw.

43:05.879 --> 43:09.651
It's hotter than a goat's
ass in a pepper patch.

43:09.652 --> 43:11.255
Well how do Missy?

43:11.256 --> 43:14.217
I see you've run into
quite a predicament.

43:14.218 --> 43:18.144
Your pussy farm's in need of harvesting.

43:18.145 --> 43:20.238
Oh, my, my, my,.

43:20.239 --> 43:24.086
I reckon I have the
right tool for the job.

43:24.087 --> 43:27.487
Bonjour, I'm about to make yo' skank ass

43:27.488 --> 43:30.947
a dick club sandwich with double meat.

43:30.948 --> 43:33.365
Extra heavy on zee jizz mayo.

43:34.392 --> 43:35.559
Hon, hon, hon.

43:37.854 --> 43:39.453
What's that you say?

43:39.454 --> 43:40.894
Pussy caught in a tree?

43:40.895 --> 43:41.957
Puh.

43:41.958 --> 43:45.375
Well slide on down
this long dick ladder.

43:48.478 --> 43:49.392
Freeze!

43:49.393 --> 43:50.631
You're under arrest for giving me

43:50.632 --> 43:53.440
a veiny throbbing cop boner.

43:54.032 --> 43:56.596
I'm the head detective
of the pussy division

43:56.597 --> 43:58.764
and you're about to serve

43:59.942 --> 44:01.300
hard time!

44:04.559 --> 44:05.879
Huh, Lieutenant McDickles mam.

44:05.880 --> 44:07.762
Call my Johnson Ryan
because your pussy's

44:07.763 --> 44:08.943
about to save my privates.

44:17.647 --> 44:20.046
There's been a nuclear cum-plosion.

44:20.047 --> 44:22.655
Clean up in aisle my pants.

44:24.977 --> 44:25.810
Okay.

44:29.795 --> 44:32.754
Not today Vir-Gina, god damn.

44:33.580 --> 44:38.058
So my mom tells me that
fat people have small dicks.

44:38.059 --> 44:40.832
I would be offended, but
I'm literally channeling

44:40.833 --> 44:44.398
all the energy I have into breathing

44:44.399 --> 44:46.558
and grasping onto the
fact that your mom talks

44:46.559 --> 44:48.778
to you about fat dicks?

44:48.779 --> 44:49.940
Tiny dick!

44:49.941 --> 44:51.382
He has a tiny dick!

44:51.383 --> 44:52.358
He showed me it!

44:52.359 --> 44:54.078
Will you shut the hell up, Virgil?

44:54.079 --> 44:55.720
I don't have a tiny dick, okay.

44:55.721 --> 44:57.360
I'll show you my dick right now bro.

44:57.361 --> 44:58.520
Want me to whip it out?

44:58.521 --> 45:00.081
I'll whip out my dick.

45:00.082 --> 45:01.931
Whatever micro penis.

45:01.932 --> 45:06.923
Waddle waddle all day
but you'll always be fat!

45:09.702 --> 45:10.535
Fucker.

45:16.145 --> 45:16.978
Bitch.

45:20.524 --> 45:24.561
I'm gonna tell my mom you fat asshole.

45:31.660 --> 45:33.019
This was definitely a good call.

45:33.020 --> 45:36.353
I've always wanted to take an art class.

45:38.222 --> 45:41.788
Once again, it feels so good
to be here with all of you,

45:41.789 --> 45:44.471
in a creative environment.

45:44.472 --> 45:46.925
Free from our smart phones and tablets

45:46.926 --> 45:50.001
and computers and TVs.

45:56.507 --> 45:59.757
Let's start with some
breathing exercises.

45:59.758 --> 46:02.175
Now everyone close your eyes,

46:03.243 --> 46:05.734
relax your bodies

46:05.735 --> 46:08.518
and slowly inhale.

46:13.384 --> 46:15.718
And exhale.

46:18.880 --> 46:21.172
Now, with your eyes closed,

46:21.173 --> 46:23.840
grab your pencils and just draw.

46:25.266 --> 46:28.668
Let the energy around
you flow through you

46:28.669 --> 46:30.226
and onto your paper.

46:37.046 --> 46:39.379
Now everyone open your eyes.

46:41.573 --> 46:43.655
Is that a dick?

46:43.656 --> 46:45.297
Well, we know where your head's at.

46:45.298 --> 46:47.873
I swear I was drawing something else.

46:47.874 --> 46:49.493
What did you draw?

46:49.494 --> 46:50.661
Same as you.

46:53.102 --> 46:54.356
Now that we're all warmed up

46:54.357 --> 46:57.598
and connected with our surroundings,

46:57.599 --> 47:00.099
it's time to begin our lesson.

47:03.261 --> 47:07.594
What kind of art class
did you say this was again?

47:09.214 --> 47:11.903
Bare witness and let
your naked eye connect

47:11.904 --> 47:13.702
with my naked human body.

47:13.703 --> 47:17.823
Look very closely and study every curve,

47:17.824 --> 47:19.399
wrinkle and pore.

47:21.834 --> 47:22.667
Yes?

47:23.958 --> 47:25.958
Is that a ding-a-ling?

47:26.872 --> 47:29.541
Yes, is there a problem?

47:29.542 --> 47:31.008
No, just,

47:32.525 --> 47:33.608
I'm good.

47:34.531 --> 47:35.967
We're good.

47:35.968 --> 47:37.385
Everybody's good.

47:40.413 --> 47:45.212
Now, let my features flow into your mind

47:45.213 --> 47:48.046
and spill out onto your paper.

47:49.327 --> 47:53.468
Well, I think I captured her

47:53.469 --> 47:55.469
and her penis perfectly.

47:57.206 --> 47:58.406
Another penis?

47:58.407 --> 48:00.568
Is there something you want
to come out of the closet

48:00.569 --> 48:02.028
for and tell me?

48:02.029 --> 48:04.184
I'm just really good at drawing penises.

48:04.185 --> 48:05.663
It's a gift.

48:05.664 --> 48:06.497
Sure.

48:06.498 --> 48:09.185
Let's see your drawing then, Picasso.

48:09.186 --> 48:11.045
All right, you're really good.

48:11.046 --> 48:12.231
Thank you.

48:12.232 --> 48:16.200
Do you like sausages?
I guess so.

48:16.201 --> 48:17.242
Why?

48:17.243 --> 48:18.459
All these penises reminded me

48:18.460 --> 48:21.689
of this fucking awesome Italian
sausage joint by my house.

48:21.690 --> 48:22.656
They're closed now,

48:22.657 --> 48:25.949
but if you're game we should
definitely go there sometime.

48:25.950 --> 48:27.433
It's molto bene.

48:28.116 --> 48:29.962
Sounds interesting, I'm game.

48:29.963 --> 48:32.463
All right, let's the fuck out of here.

48:32.464 --> 48:33.297
Bye guys.

48:33.298 --> 48:35.751
Don't forget to leave
me a review on Jewpon.

48:51.419 --> 48:52.252
Hello?

48:53.874 --> 48:56.822
Yeah, I know we don't have work today.

48:56.823 --> 48:58.745
Oh, I can sleep in?

48:58.746 --> 48:59.579
Oh really?

49:01.108 --> 49:01.941
Goodbye.

49:03.028 --> 49:04.286
Goodbye.

49:09.853 --> 49:11.809
Who's this all this for?

49:11.810 --> 49:13.256
For you silly goose.

49:13.257 --> 49:14.315
Round one.

49:14.316 --> 49:15.966
We're gonna see if you can
beat your seventh round record,

49:15.967 --> 49:17.527
my little cowboy.

49:17.528 --> 49:20.351
If you believe it, you can achieve it.

49:20.352 --> 49:22.852
Oh, I forgot your orange soda.

49:24.034 --> 49:26.130
I swear this bitch is
trying to give me diabetes.

49:34.358 --> 49:37.058
Jewpon.com.

49:39.216 --> 49:40.524
And print.

49:46.229 --> 49:48.912
How the fuck did he
make it to seven rounds?

49:48.913 --> 49:51.805
Don't give up, Matty.
You're almost there.

49:53.300 --> 49:55.787
I just, I can't do it.

49:55.788 --> 49:57.068
I can't eat another bite.

49:57.069 --> 49:58.612
Sure you can.

49:58.613 --> 50:00.358
Coming in for a landing.

50:16.210 --> 50:18.292
I understand why Matt hates you now.

50:21.245 --> 50:22.912
Good ball control.

50:23.992 --> 50:25.522
Get that ball, nobody has it!

50:25.523 --> 50:27.486
Come on, oh yeah, take it down.

50:30.971 --> 50:33.010
Hey is this the bubble soccer game?

50:33.011 --> 50:34.342
For the Jewpon promotion?

50:34.343 --> 50:36.144
Yes, are you one of the parents?

50:36.145 --> 50:39.277
No, here to kick some ass holes, sir.

50:39.278 --> 50:41.016
You didn't happen to
notice there's a slight age

50:41.017 --> 50:42.553
difference between yourself

50:42.554 --> 50:44.841
and these kids out here, did you?

50:44.842 --> 50:47.014
Yeah, but I read the coupon

50:47.015 --> 50:50.793
and it looks like there's
no age restriction, so.

50:50.794 --> 50:53.127
I'm in like nuts on yo chin!

51:18.377 --> 51:19.967
Feels like you have a few knots.

51:19.968 --> 51:20.817
Do I?

51:20.818 --> 51:22.223
Do you think you can get em out for me?

51:22.224 --> 51:23.103
Yeah, I can try.

51:23.104 --> 51:25.020
Oh, great, thank you.

51:31.010 --> 51:33.367
How's that feel?
Amazing.

51:33.368 --> 51:34.201
Good.

52:16.409 --> 52:17.939
Yes, go.

52:52.336 --> 52:53.169
Hey!

52:56.788 --> 52:58.621
Come on, lean into it.

53:18.622 --> 53:19.889
Come on, get it in there.

53:19.890 --> 53:20.723
Let's go!

53:23.283 --> 53:24.116
There!

53:45.320 --> 53:46.737
Aren't you gonna do something?

53:46.738 --> 53:47.571
Well...

53:47.572 --> 53:50.057
He is way too old to be
out there with our kids.

53:50.058 --> 53:52.299
But the coupon it doesn't restrict age.

53:52.300 --> 53:53.458
Oh, come on.

53:53.459 --> 53:54.292
That's it.

53:54.293 --> 53:56.124
Either you do something about
it or we're out of here.

53:56.125 --> 53:59.224
And we're taking our money back.

53:59.225 --> 54:00.142
Hey, you.

54:01.119 --> 54:02.720
I don't wanna play anymore.

54:02.721 --> 54:03.602
Whoo!

54:03.603 --> 54:04.884
Not in my house.

54:04.885 --> 54:06.304
Not in my house.

54:06.305 --> 54:07.900
I hate you.

54:07.901 --> 54:09.535
Hey you, it's game over.

54:09.536 --> 54:14.511
Put that bubble back where you
got it and get out of here.

54:14.512 --> 54:16.945
Hey asshole, get back here.

54:18.754 --> 54:20.504
Aw, that's my bubble.

54:22.519 --> 54:24.019
Yeah, about to get it.

54:25.851 --> 54:27.034
Oh yeah.

55:08.036 --> 55:09.850
You okay in there honey?

55:09.851 --> 55:11.371
I'm fine.

55:11.372 --> 55:12.603
Leave me alone.

55:12.604 --> 55:14.903
Okay, no need to be so rude.

55:14.904 --> 55:16.540
Wait, mom.

55:16.541 --> 55:18.584
Yes, sugar booger?

55:18.585 --> 55:20.506
What's my best friend's name?

55:20.507 --> 55:21.340
Alex?

55:22.895 --> 55:24.272
What?

55:24.273 --> 55:25.106
Alex.

55:25.698 --> 55:26.531
What?

55:26.995 --> 55:28.194
Alex!

55:28.868 --> 55:30.361
Huh?

55:30.362 --> 55:31.195
Alex.

55:34.730 --> 55:37.366
Are you sure you're
okay in there, honey?

55:37.367 --> 55:39.000
I am now.

55:46.068 --> 55:48.593
How the fuck does he survive?

55:48.594 --> 55:51.891
Why have a fridge if
you have no food in it?

55:51.892 --> 55:54.334
Get your fucking life together, man.

56:08.145 --> 56:10.225
Hey, hey, hey fat ass Albert.

56:10.226 --> 56:11.946
What's this?

56:11.947 --> 56:13.390
Dude, give that back!

56:13.391 --> 56:14.607
Just what in the hell
are you doing with a

56:14.608 --> 56:16.896
pocket pussy anyway you pathetic perv?

56:16.897 --> 56:19.457
It's not what you think, Chad.

56:19.458 --> 56:21.699
You know how girls have
a bachelorette party

56:21.700 --> 56:24.200
and they do like a dick theme?

56:24.614 --> 56:26.747
Um, my friend Eric.

56:27.222 --> 56:29.418
He is having a bachelor party

56:29.419 --> 56:32.077
and he asked me to throw it for him.

56:32.078 --> 56:34.394
So naturally I'm going
with a pussy theme.

56:34.395 --> 56:38.145
And I'm using pocket
pussies as shot glasses.

56:39.100 --> 56:41.342
See, I was just testing it.

56:41.343 --> 56:43.284
Wait, Eric.

56:43.824 --> 56:45.784
Like Eric from work Eric?

56:45.785 --> 56:47.427
Yeah.

56:47.428 --> 56:50.200
No invite for big boy Chad, huh?

56:50.201 --> 56:53.656
Fuck it, we'll have our own
party right here right now!

56:53.657 --> 56:57.282
Shots shots shots shots shots shots!

56:58.887 --> 57:01.020
Dude, dude, wait, wait.

57:03.767 --> 57:05.846
You know what, go for it bro.

57:05.847 --> 57:07.055
All yours.

57:13.102 --> 57:16.482
Oh, god, what
did you mix this with?

57:16.483 --> 57:17.316
Cum?

57:17.317 --> 57:19.341
This is the most
disgustingly awesome thing

57:19.342 --> 57:20.759
I have ever seen.

57:25.815 --> 57:28.615
Man, this shit has me buzzed.

57:29.923 --> 57:31.931
Hashtag, facial.

57:34.049 --> 57:37.032
Hashtag, money shot.

57:39.322 --> 57:42.455
Hashtag, seagulled.

57:43.857 --> 57:47.115
And, post.

57:56.991 --> 57:58.603
Your video will continue after

57:58.604 --> 58:00.604
a word from our sponsor.

58:03.585 --> 58:05.348
What are you doing?

58:05.349 --> 58:06.613
Oh my god, what are you doing?

58:06.614 --> 58:07.447
Stop.

58:07.447 --> 58:08.280
No.

58:12.609 --> 58:15.684
Well, well, well, I do declare.

58:15.685 --> 58:17.845
It looks like we have another suicide

58:17.846 --> 58:20.766
by someone high off marijuana.

58:20.767 --> 58:23.928
I'm Winfred Wade Wallace reminding you

58:23.929 --> 58:27.889
that just because weed has
been legal in Washington,

58:27.890 --> 58:29.811
does not make it safe.

58:29.812 --> 58:34.013
So next time you get
wasted on that stick-icky,

58:34.014 --> 58:37.272
remember it could be your last.

58:37.273 --> 58:40.256
What the fuck did I just watch?

59:00.160 --> 59:02.219
Hey fellas, don't you hate it

59:02.220 --> 59:04.987
when you're watching
porn and jerking off.

59:04.988 --> 59:06.947
Everything is going perfectly.

59:06.948 --> 59:08.898
The woman is beautiful.

59:08.899 --> 59:11.779
She's moaning loud because
the guy is pounding her

59:11.780 --> 59:14.505
like some insane centaur.

59:16.262 --> 59:19.422
You're close to shooting
out your cum sprinkles

59:19.423 --> 59:21.664
when out of nowhere the
angle of the video

59:21.665 --> 59:24.266
takes a turn for the worse.

59:24.267 --> 59:27.550
You're suddenly in a
very non flattering angle

59:27.551 --> 59:28.872
for straight people.

59:28.873 --> 59:30.714
You know what I'm talking about.

59:30.715 --> 59:34.599
The angle behind the dude
where absolutely zero

59:34.600 --> 59:36.963
of the girl is showing.

59:36.964 --> 59:39.205
All you see is a hairy back

59:39.206 --> 59:44.206
and ass crack with sweaty
manballs bouncing up and down.

59:44.494 --> 59:46.293
Who directed this thing?

59:46.294 --> 59:48.893
This was not what I signed up for.

59:48.894 --> 59:50.977
Talk about a jizz killer.

59:52.301 --> 59:54.851
Yep, there's no way I'm
getting this down in time.

59:54.852 --> 59:56.501
Babe, what are you doing?

59:56.502 --> 59:59.902
Have you forgotten about our
annual camping trip of love?

59:59.903 --> 01:00:04.903
Uh, no, why would I forget
something that important?

01:00:05.186 --> 01:00:08.806
Uhm, remind me what made
it so awesome last year?

01:00:08.807 --> 01:00:11.167
Oh, last year was amazing.

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:21.099
You were so romantic.

01:00:21.100 --> 01:00:22.939
I love spending time
with you by the lake

01:00:22.940 --> 01:00:24.715
just eating junk food.

01:00:24.716 --> 01:00:27.267
Making love under the stars.

01:00:27.268 --> 01:00:30.031
Having you to myself for three days.

01:00:30.032 --> 01:00:31.041
Grrrr.

01:00:31.042 --> 01:00:32.821
It'll be amazing.

01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:34.893
Uh, I'm just gonna forewarn you

01:00:34.894 --> 01:00:37.199
this year might be a
little bit different.

01:00:37.200 --> 01:00:39.533
I'm not feeling like myself.

01:00:42.307 --> 01:00:43.780
What up mother fuckers?

01:00:43.781 --> 01:00:48.033
And welcome to another segment
of E Zee Doez it on a Budget.

01:00:48.034 --> 01:00:49.397
I'm your host E Zee

01:00:49.398 --> 01:00:52.123
and if you're watching
this you're probably hungry

01:00:52.124 --> 01:00:54.054
or just fucking high.

01:00:54.055 --> 01:00:56.981
Either way, let's get this shit started.

01:00:56.982 --> 01:01:00.744
Today I'm gonna be teaching you
how to make Ghetto S'ghetti.

01:01:00.745 --> 01:01:03.369
And for all those haters out
there leaving bullshit comments

01:01:03.370 --> 01:01:06.851
on my feed below, you
can go fuck yourselves.

01:01:06.852 --> 01:01:09.993
Especially you RashelleRay24

01:01:10.202 --> 01:01:12.660
and GordonGramsy62.

01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:15.660
I will find you, and when I do,

01:01:15.661 --> 01:01:17.462
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you

01:01:17.463 --> 01:01:19.782
with your own fucking keyboards.

01:01:19.783 --> 01:01:21.248
So remember,

01:01:21.249 --> 01:01:25.257
words don't leave marks,
but keyboards do.

01:01:25.540 --> 01:01:29.032
Hot dog, I'm high as shit.

01:01:29.347 --> 01:01:32.150
What you will need for this
deliciously cheap ass meal

01:01:32.151 --> 01:01:34.273
is a packet of ramen noodles

01:01:34.274 --> 01:01:37.608
including the spices,
a package of hotdogs,

01:01:37.609 --> 01:01:40.933
and last but not least
a bottle of ketchup

01:01:40.934 --> 01:01:42.542
or Sriracha

01:01:43.125 --> 01:01:46.241
for you weird mexi chinks out there.

01:01:47.350 --> 01:01:49.567
Ewh, gross.

01:01:49.974 --> 01:01:52.184
So now what you're gonna
want to do is open up

01:01:52.185 --> 01:01:56.089
your noodle packet and
set it in the bowl.

01:01:56.090 --> 01:01:57.970
Now it's time to set you noodles

01:01:57.971 --> 01:02:00.804
in the microwave for five minutes.

01:02:04.256 --> 01:02:05.256
Seriously,

01:02:07.444 --> 01:02:10.623
how did this weird bitch
open the package so fast?

01:02:10.624 --> 01:02:11.624
Excuse me?

01:02:12.761 --> 01:02:13.777
Excuse me?

01:02:14.842 --> 01:02:15.900
Excuse me?

01:02:17.001 --> 01:02:20.402
Who the fuck are you calling
weird you fugly ass nerd?

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:21.780
Are you talking to me?

01:02:21.781 --> 01:02:24.144
Yeah asshole, I am.

01:02:24.145 --> 01:02:26.427
Maybe if you didn't have bitch arms

01:02:26.428 --> 01:02:30.230
you could open the
fucking package yourself.

01:02:30.231 --> 01:02:32.686
Well my hands are kind of sweaty.

01:02:32.687 --> 01:02:34.504
Here you go retard.

01:02:36.001 --> 01:02:37.700
What the fuck?

01:02:39.728 --> 01:02:40.728
How did you?

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:49.793
Oh yeah!

01:02:50.243 --> 01:02:51.993
The noodles are done.

01:02:53.416 --> 01:02:57.849
Now's the time that you're
gonna wanna strain that water.

01:03:00.942 --> 01:03:02.738
Do you still need this?

01:03:02.739 --> 01:03:04.072
Thanks fucker.

01:03:05.510 --> 01:03:08.915
Take this and just add that shit.

01:03:08.916 --> 01:03:12.317
Now's the time that you're
gonna add your ketchup.

01:03:12.318 --> 01:03:13.426
Or Sriracha.

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:17.859
And just get it all up in there.

01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:21.502
Mix it together and
then add your hotdogs.

01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:25.508
Bon appetit.

01:03:28.894 --> 01:03:30.892
And there you have it.

01:03:30.893 --> 01:03:32.430
Ghetto S'ghetti.

01:03:32.688 --> 01:03:35.874
Be sure to tell me how fucking
terrible this recipe is,

01:03:35.875 --> 01:03:39.114
along with all my other
ones in the comments below.

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:42.448
You sacks of shit with no fucking lives.

01:03:45.963 --> 01:03:49.046
Maybe I should stop smoking weed...

01:03:50.685 --> 01:03:52.285
Huh, nah.

01:03:52.686 --> 01:03:53.519
Stupid.

01:03:59.016 --> 01:04:01.808
Awh, holy mother of god.

01:04:07.506 --> 01:04:09.756
That is disturbingly gross.

01:04:11.987 --> 01:04:14.154
I miss my mommy's cooking.

01:04:41.341 --> 01:04:42.741
Oh, Jesus.

01:04:42.742 --> 01:04:46.082
I just wanted to give you
your second bag of brownies.

01:04:46.083 --> 01:04:48.041
Are you okay? You seem distracted?

01:04:48.718 --> 01:04:50.176
Uh, yeah.

01:04:50.177 --> 01:04:51.586
I'm fine.

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:54.591
I'm so glad we finally get
some alone time together.

01:04:54.592 --> 01:04:57.357
You've been avoiding me a lot lately.

01:04:57.358 --> 01:04:59.260
Tonight though you're all mine.

01:04:59.261 --> 01:05:02.341
Momma wants some of that
anaconda you're packing.

01:05:02.342 --> 01:05:04.624
Hey, hey, stop it with that lady!

01:05:04.625 --> 01:05:06.049
Geez.

01:05:06.050 --> 01:05:07.150
And let's be realistic here,

01:05:07.151 --> 01:05:09.819
it's more like a baby
garden snake if anything.

01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:14.151
Besides, I told you I'm just
not feeling up to it tonight.

01:05:14.152 --> 01:05:15.554
What's going on?

01:05:15.555 --> 01:05:17.684
Are you not attracted to me anymore?

01:05:17.685 --> 01:05:19.043
Don't be sad.

01:05:19.044 --> 01:05:20.645
It's not you I promise.

01:05:20.646 --> 01:05:22.005
Work's stressing me out.

01:05:22.006 --> 01:05:24.248
I got this comedy show coming
up I'm not prepared for,

01:05:24.249 --> 01:05:25.391
like at all.

01:05:27.615 --> 01:05:30.067
I'm just having stupid
man problems, okay?

01:05:30.068 --> 01:05:31.758
I promise I'll have lots and lots

01:05:31.759 --> 01:05:34.124
of crazy sex with you soon.

01:05:34.724 --> 01:05:37.318
And you'll put it in my butt too?

01:05:37.710 --> 01:05:39.433
Uh. Yeah.

01:05:39.434 --> 01:05:42.312
If you get like a million enemas first.

01:05:42.313 --> 01:05:44.335
Come on, let's go back to the tent.

01:05:44.336 --> 01:05:47.476
Those brownies are definitely
gonna hit you soon.

01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.440
Wait, what?

01:05:50.441 --> 01:05:51.274
Hit me?

Hey Alex, I hear you
want a private dance?

01:07:07.935 --> 01:07:08.885
What?

01:07:08.886 --> 01:07:11.562
No, I was in the area getting some food.

01:07:11.563 --> 01:07:13.255
Thought I'd stop by and see you.

01:07:13.256 --> 01:07:15.006
Ahh, so sweet.

01:07:16.524 --> 01:07:18.787
Hey Alex, I thought that was you.

01:07:18.788 --> 01:07:22.096
There's more seats over there, Shaniqua.

01:07:22.097 --> 01:07:23.206
What the hell mom.

01:07:23.207 --> 01:07:24.956
I mean, you're my best friend's mom.

01:07:24.957 --> 01:07:27.797
This is getting weird. Would
you give me some space?

01:07:27.798 --> 01:07:31.105
Calm down honey, there's
nothing weird going on here.

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:32.762
Ah, gross.

01:07:32.763 --> 01:07:34.084
Get out of here.

01:07:34.085 --> 01:07:35.246
Ahh.

01:07:35.247 --> 01:07:36.621
It's making it worse.

01:07:36.622 --> 01:07:38.788
Don't freak out.
It's making it worse.

01:07:38.930 --> 01:07:39.763
Ah.

01:07:41.102 --> 01:07:43.851
There's nothing to be
embarrassed about sweetie.

01:07:43.852 --> 01:07:46.413
It's a perfectly natural body function.

01:07:46.414 --> 01:07:47.247
Yeah.

01:07:47.248 --> 01:07:49.415
I'm sure you're just
feeling lonely right now.

01:07:49.416 --> 01:07:50.883
Very, lonely.

01:07:52.056 --> 01:07:53.594
You serve alcohol here, right?

01:07:53.595 --> 01:07:56.024
Yes, yes, of course we do.
Of course.

01:07:56.025 --> 01:07:56.858
What do you drink?

01:07:56.859 --> 01:07:58.196
I can get you something, sweetie.

01:07:58.197 --> 01:08:02.334
I'm a grown ass man, Shaniqua,
I can get my own alcohol.

01:08:02.335 --> 01:08:04.311
Mom, Ms. Gay.
Yeah.

01:08:04.312 --> 01:08:05.512
Can you get me something to drink?

01:08:05.513 --> 01:08:07.874
Absolutely, of course
sweetie, what do you want?

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:09.753
Uh, you know that drink
you make Matt sometimes?

01:08:09.754 --> 01:08:13.945
The blue one with the ring
of salt and the wedges.

01:08:13.946 --> 01:08:16.118
Blue balls.
Blue balls.

01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:17.261
Coming right up, sweetie.

01:08:17.261 --> 01:08:18.429
Be right back.

01:08:28.042 --> 01:08:31.517
Holly, can I ask you a question?

01:08:31.518 --> 01:08:34.423
Anything you want babe.

01:08:34.424 --> 01:08:36.947
How can someone that looks like you

01:08:36.948 --> 01:08:39.865
be with someone that looks like me?

01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:44.796
Matt, I've told you this over and over.

01:08:46.121 --> 01:08:49.725
When will you get it through
that thick sexy skull of yours?

01:08:49.725 --> 01:08:52.770
It doesn't matter what you look like,

01:08:52.770 --> 01:08:56.493
even though I think you're sexy as hell.

01:08:56.495 --> 01:08:59.737
I'm attracted to the
person I know you are.

01:08:59.738 --> 01:09:01.828
I love you for you.

01:09:03.385 --> 01:09:07.085
And I always will, with all my heart.

01:09:08.716 --> 01:09:11.510
Whether you look like this

01:09:11.511 --> 01:09:14.698
or you turn into a skinny
little toothpick like Alex.

01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.450
You'll always be my chubby bunny.

01:09:18.742 --> 01:09:20.334
I feel so weird.

01:09:21.716 --> 01:09:25.258
I'm all dizzy in my brain head.

01:09:26.234 --> 01:09:27.562
Well, I probably would too

01:09:27.563 --> 01:09:31.365
if I ate an entire bag of
shroom infused pot brownies.

01:09:31.366 --> 01:09:32.606
What?

01:09:32.607 --> 01:09:34.861
Who the hell mixes shrooms
with weed brownies?

01:09:34.862 --> 01:09:37.321
It doesn't even make any sense.

01:09:37.496 --> 01:09:39.162
Oh my fucking taint.

01:09:40.862 --> 01:09:43.640

01:10:19.279 --> 01:10:22.370
in the whole wide world

01:10:22.371 --> 01:10:25.373
to erase the memories from tonight.

01:10:27.204 --> 01:10:29.025
All right.

01:10:29.026 --> 01:10:30.226
Are you okay?

01:10:30.227 --> 01:10:31.587
Keep em coming, Shaniqua.

01:10:31.588 --> 01:10:34.124
Oh honey, I think you've had enough.

01:10:34.125 --> 01:10:35.866
Shhhh.

01:10:36.730 --> 01:10:38.541
What'd I say?

01:10:38.542 --> 01:10:40.382
What'd I say, Shaniqua?

01:10:40.383 --> 01:10:41.458
I said

01:10:42.226 --> 01:10:44.567
I'm a grown ass boy.

01:10:45.811 --> 01:10:48.411
You are.
Keep 'em coming.

01:10:50.610 --> 01:10:52.466
For the bus ride home.

01:11:02.254 --> 01:11:03.087
Holly?

01:11:04.575 --> 01:11:05.408
Holly?

01:11:11.472 --> 01:11:12.513
Calm down, sweetie.

01:11:12.514 --> 01:11:14.231
You're starting to have a bad trip.

01:11:14.232 --> 01:11:15.065
It's okay.

01:11:15.065 --> 01:11:15.950
Calm down sweetie.

01:11:15.951 --> 01:11:17.871
You're starting to have a bad trip.

01:11:17.872 --> 01:11:18.705
It's okay.

01:11:18.705 --> 01:11:19.538
Calm down sweetie.

01:11:19.539 --> 01:11:21.365
You're starting to have a bad trip.

01:11:21.366 --> 01:11:22.437
It's okay.

01:11:22.438 --> 01:11:23.296
Calm down sweetie.

01:11:23.297 --> 01:11:25.294
Calm down sweetie.
Calm down sweetie.

01:11:25.295 --> 01:11:27.337
You're starting to have a bad trip.

01:11:27.338 --> 01:11:28.580
It's okay.

01:11:32.416 --> 01:11:33.634
What's wrong, Alex?

01:11:33.635 --> 01:11:35.852
Are you feeling okay, Alex?

01:11:35.853 --> 01:11:37.718
Are you all right, Alex?

01:11:37.719 --> 01:11:39.881
Haven't you ever been high before, Alex?

01:11:39.882 --> 01:11:42.043
Alex, Alex, Alex.

01:12:00.008 --> 01:12:00.841
Gotcha.

01:12:03.546 --> 01:12:04.379
Tag.

01:12:05.310 --> 01:12:06.143
Gotcha.

01:12:08.577 --> 01:12:10.820
Hey, you little bastards.

01:12:10.821 --> 01:12:12.704
Keep it down.

01:12:12.705 --> 01:12:16.335
Wake me up again and
nobody's getting any dinner.

01:12:16.336 --> 01:12:18.003
You little shits.

01:12:24.068 --> 01:12:27.450
You're supposed to be
watching us, you stupid bitch.

01:12:27.451 --> 01:12:28.402
Tag.

01:12:28.403 --> 01:12:30.037
Tag.

01:13:00.436 --> 01:13:03.221
I made you more pot brownies.

01:13:03.222 --> 01:13:04.722
They're delicious.

01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:07.653
Holly?

01:13:14.800 --> 01:13:15.633
Holly?

01:13:18.370 --> 01:13:19.203
Holly?

01:13:21.946 --> 01:13:24.946
Hey, Alex, do you want to join us?

01:13:27.131 --> 01:13:28.748
Come join us, Alex.
Come join us Alex.

01:13:28.749 --> 01:13:29.870
Come join us.

01:13:29.871 --> 01:13:31.286
Join us, Alex.

01:13:31.287 --> 01:13:33.370
Come on, Alex, join us.

01:13:34.789 --> 01:13:36.510
What are you waiting for?

01:13:36.511 --> 01:13:38.152
The milk's nice and warm.

01:13:38.153 --> 01:13:41.069
Yeah, Alex, join us.
Join us.

01:13:41.070 --> 01:13:43.455
Join us.
Join us.

01:13:43.456 --> 01:13:45.747
The milk's nice and warm.

01:13:46.832 --> 01:13:48.624

01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:51.461

How's it-how's it hanging?

01:15:04.106 --> 01:15:05.218
Matt?

01:15:05.468 --> 01:15:06.610
Is that you?

01:15:07.679 --> 01:15:09.179
You're an old man.

01:15:12.096 --> 01:15:13.417
You're old.

01:15:13.418 --> 01:15:15.768
Yeah, so are you.

01:15:15.903 --> 01:15:17.428
Who gives a fuck?

01:15:22.463 --> 01:15:24.565
The hell is going on?

01:15:24.566 --> 01:15:26.447
Matt? Matt?

01:15:26.448 --> 01:15:29.174
Why do you keep calling me Matt?

01:15:29.175 --> 01:15:30.908
I'm not Matt

01:15:30.909 --> 01:15:31.792
Huh?

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:33.116
I'm Alex.

01:15:33.117 --> 01:15:33.950
What?

01:15:40.386 --> 01:15:42.786
What we never changed?

01:16:00.188 --> 01:16:01.428
Oh, it's okay.

01:16:01.429 --> 01:16:02.262
It's okay.

01:16:03.349 --> 01:16:05.682
Rise and shine chubby bunny.

01:16:09.949 --> 01:16:11.782
Okay, okay, I'm awake.

01:16:11.783 --> 01:16:12.782
Jesus.

01:16:12.783 --> 01:16:15.862
Ah, where are your clothes?

01:16:15.863 --> 01:16:18.704
Uhm, don't you remember
anything about last night?

01:16:18.705 --> 01:16:23.273
I know you were on a crazy
trip but you were an animal.

01:16:23.274 --> 01:16:24.107
No.

01:16:24.107 --> 01:16:24.940
No way.

01:16:26.198 --> 01:16:29.320
My clothes are still
on and the arm floats.

01:16:29.321 --> 01:16:32.240
Come on, we didn't really do anything.

01:16:32.241 --> 01:16:33.281
Did we?

01:16:33.282 --> 01:16:36.303
Well you just whipped out
Action Jackson and went at it.

01:16:36.304 --> 01:16:37.385
I went at it?

01:16:37.386 --> 01:16:38.587
Bullshit.

01:16:38.588 --> 01:16:40.735
You drugged and raped me.

01:16:40.736 --> 01:16:42.096
I should've known you were lying.

01:16:42.097 --> 01:16:42.930
Nobody mixes shrooms with weed,

01:16:42.931 --> 01:16:46.182
that doesn't even make any sense.

01:16:46.183 --> 01:16:47.903
You roofied me didn't you?

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:50.743
I wasn't giving it up, you
decided to roofie rape me.

01:16:50.744 --> 01:16:53.019
That's what happened.

01:16:53.020 --> 01:16:54.437
The fuck is that?

01:16:55.417 --> 01:16:58.360
See, I was fucking right.

01:16:58.361 --> 01:16:59.374
The fuck!

01:17:15.921 --> 01:17:17.588
Good morning, mom.

01:17:22.207 --> 01:17:24.540
The fuck are you doing here?

01:17:28.689 --> 01:17:29.522
Wait...

01:17:31.654 --> 01:17:32.487
Did we...

01:17:35.903 --> 01:17:36.753
No.

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:38.030
No.

01:17:38.305 --> 01:17:39.138
No.

01:17:40.429 --> 01:17:41.329
No.

01:17:41.820 --> 01:17:44.322
We need to talk about last night.

01:17:44.747 --> 01:17:47.791
Figure out what we're gonna tell Matt.

01:17:48.366 --> 01:17:52.687
We are not going to talk
to Matt about anything,

01:17:52.688 --> 01:17:55.371
especially what happened last night.

01:17:55.372 --> 01:17:56.963
I'm outta here.

01:17:56.964 --> 01:17:59.357
Put some damn clothes on.

01:18:19.993 --> 01:18:21.429
Fucking voice mail.

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.467
Answer your phone dick.

01:18:23.468 --> 01:18:25.635
Fuck.

01:18:28.190 --> 01:18:30.374
Come on, Holly, answer.

01:18:31.072 --> 01:18:34.499
I need to hear your voice right now.

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.214
Hey, you've reached, Holly.

01:18:36.215 --> 01:18:38.578
I'm on a camping trip with
the sexiest man alive.

01:18:38.579 --> 01:18:40.200
No cell service, so leave a message

01:18:40.201 --> 01:18:42.161
and I'll get back to you
when I have a signal.

01:18:42.162 --> 01:18:43.884
You know, unless we're eaten by bears.

01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:44.718
Roar.

01:18:45.561 --> 01:18:47.300
Bye.
The trip was today?

01:18:47.301 --> 01:18:48.862
Hey, Alex.

01:18:48.863 --> 01:18:50.314
Everything all right this morning?

01:18:50.315 --> 01:18:51.148
Yeah.

01:18:51.149 --> 01:18:53.065
Now fuck off, Shaniqua.

01:19:14.743 --> 01:19:17.010
Are those fucking JNCOs?

01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:20.422
Fuck yeah.

01:19:20.423 --> 01:19:22.041
Dope, right?

01:19:22.042 --> 01:19:24.850
Wait, what the hell are you doing?

01:19:24.851 --> 01:19:26.253
Don't worry about me,

01:19:26.254 --> 01:19:27.855
just getting rid of
evidence from something

01:19:27.856 --> 01:19:31.006
I'll never speak of ever again.

01:19:34.285 --> 01:19:36.665
So did you and my girlfriend have fun

01:19:36.666 --> 01:19:40.099
on our very, very romantic

01:19:40.732 --> 01:19:41.847
anniversary trip?

01:19:41.848 --> 01:19:46.504
Yeah, we just, it was
really boring actually.

01:19:46.505 --> 01:19:47.572
We just stayed up all night

01:19:47.573 --> 01:19:49.258
and she talked about
how awesome you are.

01:19:49.259 --> 01:19:51.092
I disagreed of course.

01:19:51.905 --> 01:19:53.386
And then we fell asleep,

01:19:53.387 --> 01:19:56.829
very, very far away from each other.

01:19:57.830 --> 01:20:00.247
Wow, after last night...

01:20:03.077 --> 01:20:05.966
This situation is
obviously pretty crazy.

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:09.202
That, mixed with the fact
that Holly is so fucking sexy.

01:20:09.203 --> 01:20:11.722
She can't resist my handsome mug.

01:20:11.723 --> 01:20:14.241
I know fighting her off must be hard.

01:20:14.242 --> 01:20:15.726
So thank you.

01:20:15.727 --> 01:20:17.727
Uhm, you're welcome...

01:20:19.693 --> 01:20:22.340
I guess it kinda has been pretty hard.

01:20:22.341 --> 01:20:24.999
Like I said, thanks.

01:20:25.383 --> 01:20:26.216
I really apprec...

01:20:26.217 --> 01:20:27.925
Hey babe, why'd you storm out?

01:20:27.926 --> 01:20:28.926
Oh hey Alex.

01:20:29.810 --> 01:20:32.538
Did you fuck my girlfriend?

01:20:32.539 --> 01:20:33.372
Did you?

01:20:34.616 --> 01:20:36.449
Did you mother fucker?

01:20:37.638 --> 01:20:40.520
Did you fuck my future wife

01:20:40.521 --> 01:20:42.523
and mother of my unborn children?

01:20:42.524 --> 01:20:43.566
Will you stop it.

01:20:43.567 --> 01:20:44.882
Oh, you want me to stop?

01:20:44.883 --> 01:20:47.259
Like how you stopped yourself
from fucking my girlfriend?

01:20:47.260 --> 01:20:50.129
You're going to burn your
own body over an accident?

01:20:50.130 --> 01:20:51.051
Why not?

01:20:51.052 --> 01:20:53.173
I'll go kamikaze to take you out.

01:20:53.174 --> 01:20:55.457
And please, elaborate,

01:20:55.458 --> 01:20:57.962
how does one go about
accidentally fucking someone?

01:20:57.963 --> 01:20:59.388
Huh?
Will you-

01:20:59.695 --> 01:21:01.299
Will you knock it off?

01:21:01.300 --> 01:21:03.869
Last night was the worst
night of my life.

01:21:03.870 --> 01:21:05.476
You don't even understand, dude.

01:21:05.477 --> 01:21:08.473
I'm not getting into any details ever,

01:21:08.474 --> 01:21:12.761
but I guarantee my night
was way worse than yours.

01:21:12.762 --> 01:21:14.801
No, my night was worse.

01:21:14.802 --> 01:21:16.084
I promise you.

01:21:16.085 --> 01:21:18.727
And I swear I didn't
plan or even remember

01:21:18.728 --> 01:21:20.332
what happened last night.

01:21:20.333 --> 01:21:21.861
I put that on my mother.

01:21:21.862 --> 01:21:23.585
You don't have a real mom to swear on.

01:21:23.586 --> 01:21:25.826
We both know your real
mom dropped you off

01:21:25.827 --> 01:21:27.589
at some ghetto ass foster home

01:21:27.590 --> 01:21:31.310
because she couldn't possibly
love a piece of shit like you.

01:21:31.311 --> 01:21:33.190
You're a real funny guy, Matt.

01:21:33.191 --> 01:21:34.042
Thank you.

01:21:34.043 --> 01:21:37.156
No, you're all fun and
games, that's your problem.

01:21:37.157 --> 01:21:38.929
You sit on your fat fucking ass all day

01:21:38.930 --> 01:21:41.829
while your moms and your
girlfriend do everything for you.

01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:43.150
You have no motivation at all,

01:21:43.151 --> 01:21:44.532
you haven't even made
one grown up decision

01:21:44.533 --> 01:21:46.119
in your entire life.

01:21:46.120 --> 01:21:47.639
You've only been in my
body for a few days

01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:49.083
and you've already gained weight,

01:21:49.084 --> 01:21:50.446
god only knows what
you've done to my lungs

01:21:50.447 --> 01:21:52.127
with all that shit that you smoke.

01:21:52.128 --> 01:21:54.532
Oh, you're one to talk about motivation.

01:21:54.533 --> 01:21:56.164
You've barely even practiced my stand up

01:21:56.165 --> 01:21:58.066
and the contest is in two days.

01:21:58.067 --> 01:22:00.025
You're going to either not show up

01:22:00.026 --> 01:22:02.163
or choke like you always do

01:22:02.164 --> 01:22:05.891
when you talk to anyone else besides me.

01:22:05.892 --> 01:22:08.294
There's a reason you have
no real family or friends.

01:22:08.295 --> 01:22:12.181
It's because you have
a shitty personality.

01:22:12.182 --> 01:22:14.181
And the only reason I've tolerated you

01:22:14.182 --> 01:22:17.676
all this time is because
I felt sorry for you.

01:22:17.677 --> 01:22:18.718
I don't need you.

01:22:18.719 --> 01:22:20.643
You're literally the most annoying

01:22:20.644 --> 01:22:22.445
fucking person in the entire world.

01:22:22.446 --> 01:22:25.333
And now that I'm stuck in this
fat fucking disgusting body

01:22:25.334 --> 01:22:26.776
I can't comprehend why you haven't

01:22:26.777 --> 01:22:28.619
fucking killed yourself yet.

01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:30.905
And the reason why I haven't
practice your stand up

01:22:30.906 --> 01:22:33.796
is because your material fucking blows.

01:22:33.797 --> 01:22:35.973
You are not funny!

01:22:35.974 --> 01:22:39.030
You take that
back you son of a bitch.

01:22:39.031 --> 01:22:41.281
Nope, I put it out there.

01:22:42.461 --> 01:22:43.654
I set it free.

01:22:43.655 --> 01:22:47.105
And besides, it's not like it
news to anyone anyway, bitch.

01:23:08.046 --> 01:23:11.063
Yeah, walk away pussy.

01:23:52.599 --> 01:23:53.432
Hah hah.

01:23:57.516 --> 01:23:59.166
You okay?

01:23:59.167 --> 01:24:02.084
I realize that a bottle to the face

01:24:03.489 --> 01:24:06.489
may not have been the best idea but,

01:24:07.553 --> 01:24:09.652
you did say I wasn't funny.

01:24:34.222 --> 01:24:35.759
Get off him, you're hurting him.

01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:37.051
Oh, fuck.

01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:39.961
I'm sorry babe, are you okay?

01:24:39.962 --> 01:24:41.459
I didn't mean to.
Get off me, Alex.

01:24:41.460 --> 01:24:43.135
Babe, are you okay?

01:24:44.677 --> 01:24:46.210
Did he hurt you?

01:24:50.724 --> 01:24:54.048
You know, you only had one friend.

01:24:54.049 --> 01:24:57.754
You slept with my girlfriend
so now you have zero friends.

01:24:57.755 --> 01:25:00.615
Unless you have information
on how to switch us back

01:25:00.616 --> 01:25:02.261
I don't want to hear shit from you.

01:25:02.262 --> 01:25:04.863
And once we do figure
this whole thing out,

01:25:04.864 --> 01:25:08.398
I'll really be done with you for good.

01:25:08.399 --> 01:25:10.280
What's going on?

01:25:10.281 --> 01:25:11.114
Nothing.

01:25:12.122 --> 01:25:13.467
It's complicated.

01:25:13.468 --> 01:25:14.887
Is there someone else?

01:25:14.888 --> 01:25:18.055
No, it's just you, Holly, I promise.

01:25:20.530 --> 01:25:21.771
You're lazy.

01:25:21.772 --> 01:25:23.619
You can't make any grown up decisions.

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.834
Yeah, okay.

01:25:24.835 --> 01:25:26.101
You won't be saying that
when I kick the shit

01:25:26.102 --> 01:25:28.760
out of this bitch ass triathlon.

01:25:28.761 --> 01:25:32.051
Bonjour, you are a
disgusting fat American.

01:25:33.142 --> 01:25:33.975
You are weak.

01:25:33.976 --> 01:25:35.015
You are fat.

01:25:45.766 --> 01:25:48.807
You remind me of my
wife, ugly and stiff.

01:25:49.642 --> 01:25:53.960
I bet if there was a cheeseburger
you'd make it to the end.

01:26:01.286 --> 01:26:02.119
What is this?

01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:03.326
You think you are pretty?

01:26:03.327 --> 01:26:04.732
You are a hippopotamus.

01:26:04.733 --> 01:26:06.096
Look at your fat ass.

01:26:06.097 --> 01:26:07.178
Get out of here.

01:26:15.621 --> 01:26:16.897
Get out of my sight.

01:26:17.105 --> 01:26:18.087
Get out of here.

01:26:18.487 --> 01:26:19.712
Get out of here.

01:26:25.223 --> 01:26:27.263
Don't be a fat American.

01:26:27.264 --> 01:26:29.767
Call me, I will make you skinny.

01:26:29.768 --> 01:26:32.518
About to step up my game today.

01:26:40.496 --> 01:26:42.508
Talk about a jizz killer.

01:26:42.509 --> 01:26:43.342
What.

01:26:45.519 --> 01:26:47.415
Honey bunny, I made your

01:26:47.416 --> 01:26:50.154
third round of breakfast,
come and get it.

01:26:50.155 --> 01:26:54.155
Not right now, mom,
I'm working on something.

01:26:56.345 --> 01:26:58.069
I'm a real man.

01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.987
I got this.

01:27:00.113 --> 01:27:01.722
I won't choke.

01:27:08.187 --> 01:27:11.566
Seriously, I thought
he had a smart fridge.

01:27:11.567 --> 01:27:15.150
Isn't this shit supposed
to refill itself?

01:27:16.326 --> 01:27:18.687
Where the hell is this trainer guy?

01:27:18.688 --> 01:27:20.728
I've been waiting for minutes.

01:27:20.729 --> 01:27:25.479
Man, maybe paying over the
phone wasn't such a good idea.

01:27:26.977 --> 01:27:27.977
You know what?

01:27:27.978 --> 01:27:29.298
Fuck this.

01:27:29.299 --> 01:27:31.504
I don't need anyone's help.

01:27:31.505 --> 01:27:33.255
I can do this myself.

01:27:56.951 --> 01:27:58.518
What the fuck?

01:28:01.583 --> 01:28:05.174
It's called a tomato, fat American.

01:28:05.175 --> 01:28:07.911
Get the fuck away
from me you crazy fuck.

01:28:07.912 --> 01:28:10.280
And this is called a banana.

01:28:19.561 --> 01:28:22.236
I think jizzing for me

01:28:22.722 --> 01:28:26.755
is a lot like when I sneeze.

01:28:27.754 --> 01:28:28.587
Uhm,

01:28:29.712 --> 01:28:32.828
once I start I can't stop

01:28:33.264 --> 01:28:36.239
and it usually happens out of nowhere

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:39.496
and very quickly.

01:28:39.744 --> 01:28:42.008
And I also look funny as hell

01:28:42.009 --> 01:28:45.593
because I'm making
weird faces like, awh.

01:28:46.035 --> 01:28:47.173
How was that?

01:28:47.174 --> 01:28:49.242
Well it's great babe
if you could just maybe

01:28:49.243 --> 01:28:50.669
loosen up a little bit.

01:28:50.670 --> 01:28:53.839
Yeah, I mean, like it's good.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:57.118
But you're really tense right now.

01:28:57.119 --> 01:28:58.622
Thank you.

01:29:09.318 --> 01:29:12.570
Hey ladies and ladies,
here's a fun fact about me.

01:29:12.571 --> 01:29:14.956
If you're not man or a family member

01:29:14.957 --> 01:29:18.511
there's a small tiny part of
me that wants to fuck you.

01:29:19.631 --> 01:29:24.381
And that small and tiny part
of me, it's called my penis.

01:29:27.722 --> 01:29:31.202
I don't know why you're
laughing, you're my girlfriend.

01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:39.129
Hey little piggie.

01:29:39.130 --> 01:29:41.297
Swim fat American piggie.

01:29:43.478 --> 01:29:45.401
I'm not even fat anymore asshole.

01:29:49.069 --> 01:29:52.194
Just want to say that it
is fantastic to be here.

01:29:52.195 --> 01:29:54.957
I actually just flew into town

01:29:54.958 --> 01:29:57.125
and boy are my arms tired.

01:29:58.802 --> 01:30:01.123
From masturbating on the plane.

01:30:01.985 --> 01:30:03.958
It's exhausting.

01:30:10.867 --> 01:30:15.792
Hey, I'm Alex.

01:30:17.291 --> 01:30:18.124
I mean.

01:30:18.124 --> 01:30:18.957
Fuck.

01:30:20.312 --> 01:30:24.287
Hey everybody, I'm Matt and a-

01:30:25.997 --> 01:30:27.497
Fuck is, fuck you.

01:30:28.436 --> 01:30:30.733
Piece of shit. Ah damn it.

01:30:31.679 --> 01:30:32.760
All right you got this.

01:30:32.761 --> 01:30:34.134
You got this.

01:30:34.135 --> 01:30:36.468
All right everyone, line up.

01:30:39.426 --> 01:30:40.672
Who's ready to run?

01:30:41.923 --> 01:30:44.336
All right, that's what I like to see.

01:30:44.337 --> 01:30:47.105
Remember, if you believe
in it you can achieve it.

01:30:47.106 --> 01:30:49.216
I wanna see some hustle today.

01:30:49.217 --> 01:30:50.893
On your marks.

01:30:50.894 --> 01:30:52.409
Get set.

01:30:52.410 --> 01:30:53.243
Go.

01:30:57.426 --> 01:30:59.009
What are you doing?

01:31:02.451 --> 01:31:04.457
Basically what I'm
trying to say is, you know

01:31:04.458 --> 01:31:05.859
I'm still horny from last night.

01:31:05.860 --> 01:31:08.661
So after the show if you want
to have some horrible sex,

01:31:08.662 --> 01:31:09.562
come find me.

01:31:11.846 --> 01:31:12.949
Thank you.

01:31:16.546 --> 01:31:17.881
Good job man, good job.

01:31:17.882 --> 01:31:18.715
Good job.

01:31:18.716 --> 01:31:21.088
Give it up one more time guys for Kyle.

01:31:23.073 --> 01:31:28.073
Your next person coming
to the stage is Matt Gaye.

01:31:28.909 --> 01:31:30.874
Don't be a pussy.

01:31:30.875 --> 01:31:32.625
You fucking got this.

01:31:34.741 --> 01:31:36.688
Matt Gaye, to the stage.
Oh fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:31:36.689 --> 01:31:37.522
Okay.

01:31:39.629 --> 01:31:42.332
Matt Gaye, you out there buddy?

01:31:42.333 --> 01:31:44.500
Oh, are you, are you Matt?

01:31:45.970 --> 01:31:47.170
You can come up this way.

01:31:47.171 --> 01:31:48.004
Okay.

01:31:52.788 --> 01:31:53.771
Hello every...

01:31:53.772 --> 01:31:55.559
Hello everybody.

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:56.643
Hello.
Hi.

01:31:58.612 --> 01:31:59.445
Okay.

01:32:02.204 --> 01:32:03.745
Uh, so...

01:32:04.854 --> 01:32:07.708
One tiny fact you might know about me.

01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:09.393
That you probably don't know about me.

01:32:09.394 --> 01:32:10.869
I mean, I mean why would you know,

01:32:10.870 --> 01:32:12.563
we haven't had sex, or fucked it up,

01:32:12.564 --> 01:32:14.311
or fucked and sex, so.

01:32:16.482 --> 01:32:20.499
I don't have an above
average size penis.

01:32:20.982 --> 01:32:21.815
Uh.

01:32:22.269 --> 01:32:26.185
I also don't own an average sized penis.

01:32:26.662 --> 01:32:28.477
Okay, what I'm trying
to say is that, I just,

01:32:28.478 --> 01:32:30.478
I have a tiny dick, so.

01:32:35.604 --> 01:32:38.271
I

01:32:47.491 --> 01:32:50.134
Another fun fact about me

01:32:50.135 --> 01:32:54.704
is I thoroughly enjoy
masturbating, like a lot.

01:32:54.705 --> 01:32:58.085
And I've noticed that
I jerk off really fast.

01:32:58.086 --> 01:32:59.419
I'm much like the flash.

01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:00.858
You can't even see my hand.

01:33:00.859 --> 01:33:04.520
It's faster than that, I'm
just not horny right now, so.

01:33:04.521 --> 01:33:06.780
This inspired me for a brilliant script

01:33:06.781 --> 01:33:07.933
that I'm writing right now,

01:33:07.934 --> 01:33:10.579
it's actually called
Whack to the Future.

01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:11.463
It's action packed.

01:33:11.464 --> 01:33:14.159
It's starring Tom Hardy
and Palmela Handerson.

01:33:14.994 --> 01:33:16.463
Every time Mr. Hardy finds himself

01:33:16.464 --> 01:33:18.813
in a sticky situation he
runs out to the streets,

01:33:18.814 --> 01:33:21.033
just jerking off.

01:33:21.034 --> 01:33:23.373
That's how he looks.

01:33:23.374 --> 01:33:25.656
And right when he
reaches 88 miles per hour

01:33:25.657 --> 01:33:28.464
he ejaculates and
disappears in the distance.

01:33:28.465 --> 01:33:30.464
But instead of two flames in the road,

01:33:30.465 --> 01:33:32.909
there's two steamy, gooey piles of cum.

01:33:34.357 --> 01:33:36.235
Whack to the future.

01:33:36.236 --> 01:33:38.528
Cumming, eh, this summer.

01:33:41.373 --> 01:33:43.566
Masturbation doesn't turn you blind,

01:33:43.567 --> 01:33:46.295
it takes you back in time.

01:34:07.928 --> 01:34:10.152
So fucking tired.

01:34:10.153 --> 01:34:12.075
I can't do this.

01:34:12.076 --> 01:34:13.409
I want my mommy.

01:34:15.577 --> 01:34:19.160
Ahh, thanks for showing
me your dick asshole.

01:34:20.366 --> 01:34:23.533
At least I don't have to piss anymore.

01:34:26.441 --> 01:34:28.218
Ladies and gentleman give it up

01:34:28.219 --> 01:34:31.633
for your winner of
tonight's competition.

01:34:31.634 --> 01:34:32.992
Carlos.

01:34:35.279 --> 01:34:37.700
Congratulations Carlos.

01:34:37.701 --> 01:34:39.240
Thank you, thank you.
You just won $5,000

01:34:39.241 --> 01:34:42.057
and you're gonna headline at
our club for the next month.

01:34:42.058 --> 01:34:43.889
Give it up for our runner-ups.

01:34:43.890 --> 01:34:45.970
They're gonna be getting
some comedy classes,

01:34:45.971 --> 01:34:48.863
hey, they need 'em obviously.

01:34:48.864 --> 01:34:50.183
Once again give it up for Carlos.

01:34:50.184 --> 01:34:52.513
Every one make it home
safe, thanks for coming out.

01:35:02.227 --> 01:35:03.671
Sand in my ass.

01:35:03.672 --> 01:35:05.422
Sand in my ass crack.

01:35:06.677 --> 01:35:09.401
Why didn't I change before
jumping in the water?

01:35:09.402 --> 01:35:10.735
So many regrets.

01:35:12.727 --> 01:35:15.871
Who am I kidding, I can't do this.

01:35:15.872 --> 01:35:17.650
So fucking tired.

01:35:17.651 --> 01:35:19.856
Where the hell is everyone?

01:35:19.857 --> 01:35:22.253
I can't be the only one out here still.

01:35:22.254 --> 01:35:23.254
Hey there.

01:35:25.860 --> 01:35:28.277
Whoa, are you like a ninja?

01:35:29.848 --> 01:35:31.090
How am I supposed to finish this thing

01:35:31.091 --> 01:35:32.998
with all this shit running down my leg?

01:35:32.999 --> 01:35:34.275
Ewh.

01:35:34.276 --> 01:35:37.891
Whatever, I'm just glad I'm
not the only one still here.

01:35:37.892 --> 01:35:39.069
Oh, sorry.

01:35:39.070 --> 01:35:39.903
Here.

01:35:41.269 --> 01:35:42.487
What's this?

01:35:42.488 --> 01:35:44.334
That's your medal.

01:35:44.335 --> 01:35:46.933
You actually ran out of
time for the triathlon.

01:35:46.934 --> 01:35:48.815
Everyone else left.

01:35:48.816 --> 01:35:51.697
Thanks for trying and have a great day.

01:35:51.698 --> 01:35:52.531
Bye.

01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:13.358
Are you fucking serious?

01:36:19.339 --> 01:36:20.172
Hey.

01:36:21.702 --> 01:36:24.542
Stop crying you girly American.

01:36:24.543 --> 01:36:26.453
Would you leave me alone?

01:36:26.454 --> 01:36:28.450
The race is over. I lost, okay?

01:36:28.451 --> 01:36:30.368
Go bother someone else.

01:36:35.057 --> 01:36:38.102
I don't know what the
fuck you're saying.

01:36:38.103 --> 01:36:41.828
I said, you are no
longer a fat American.

01:36:43.127 --> 01:36:46.544
Maybe a chubby American,
but that's okay.

01:36:47.849 --> 01:36:48.682
Stand up.

01:36:50.742 --> 01:36:53.158
Finish the pointless race.

01:36:53.159 --> 01:36:57.242
Do something for once in
your insignificant life.

01:38:03.656 --> 01:38:04.489
Yes.

01:38:06.296 --> 01:38:07.129
Yes.

01:38:08.902 --> 01:38:09.735
Whoo.

01:38:11.151 --> 01:38:12.559
Whoo.

01:38:12.560 --> 01:38:14.166
I finished the race.

01:38:14.167 --> 01:38:15.693
You hear that Alex?

01:38:15.694 --> 01:38:16.527
Fuck you.

01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:19.543
Fuck you.

01:38:49.947 --> 01:38:52.026
Didn't we just have sex the other night?

01:38:52.027 --> 01:38:53.281
No, we haven't.

01:38:53.282 --> 01:38:56.106
We haven't had sex in days
and it feels like an eternity.

01:38:56.107 --> 01:38:57.786
Lately I feel like Action Jackson's

01:38:57.787 --> 01:39:01.189
turning into like old retired Jackson.

01:39:01.190 --> 01:39:03.476
Wait, are you saying we did not sleep

01:39:03.477 --> 01:39:05.962
with each other on the camping trip?

01:39:05.963 --> 01:39:07.806
Don't sound so excited about it.

01:39:07.807 --> 01:39:09.529
No we didn't.

01:39:09.530 --> 01:39:12.616
I tried but you just pulled it out

01:39:12.617 --> 01:39:14.420
and started touching yourself.

01:39:14.421 --> 01:39:17.185
So naturally, I did the
same thing to Misses Jackson

01:39:17.186 --> 01:39:19.402
and we fell asleep.

01:39:20.233 --> 01:39:24.678
As disturbing as that
sounds I'm actually relieved.

01:39:24.679 --> 01:39:26.398
Relieved?

01:39:26.399 --> 01:39:28.838
You're relieved we didn't have sex?

01:39:28.839 --> 01:39:29.882
What's going on with you?

01:39:29.883 --> 01:39:31.124
Are you cheating on me?

01:39:31.125 --> 01:39:33.525
Do you think I'm ugly?

01:39:33.526 --> 01:39:36.934
No, no, it's not any of that.

01:39:39.293 --> 01:39:42.660
Lately I've been working
on fixing myself.

01:39:42.661 --> 01:39:45.312
I know it sounds dumb,

01:39:45.313 --> 01:39:48.630
but I swear it's not you it's me, okay?

01:39:50.465 --> 01:39:53.145
One of the many lessons I've
learned these last few days

01:39:53.146 --> 01:39:55.269
is that you are one of the most kindest

01:39:55.270 --> 01:39:58.451
and caring women I've
met in my entire life.

01:39:58.452 --> 01:40:00.875
You are so beautiful inside and out

01:40:00.876 --> 01:40:02.894
and the fact that you
feel the same about me

01:40:02.895 --> 01:40:04.978
will always blow my mind.

01:40:06.378 --> 01:40:10.899
And for your information, Mr.
Action Jackson is not retired.

01:40:10.900 --> 01:40:13.651
He's more like on a hiatus
gaining his strength

01:40:13.652 --> 01:40:16.405
and I have a feeling he's
gonna be back very soon

01:40:16.406 --> 01:40:18.156
and better than ever.

01:40:19.943 --> 01:40:21.943
I love you jelly bear.

01:40:23.273 --> 01:40:28.273
Well, it's been fun, but
it's time to say goodbye.

01:40:28.650 --> 01:40:29.724
I know.

01:40:29.725 --> 01:40:31.403
I'm going to miss you too,

01:40:31.404 --> 01:40:35.513
but we'll see each other all the time.

01:40:35.514 --> 01:40:36.465
I promise,

01:40:36.466 --> 01:40:39.614
I promise we're gonna see
each other again, all right?

01:40:39.615 --> 01:40:42.482
No, don't you, don't you dare.

01:40:43.909 --> 01:40:45.831
We said we weren't gonna cry.

01:40:46.206 --> 01:40:47.803
Might as well eat shitty one last time

01:40:47.804 --> 01:40:49.926
before I get my body back.

01:40:49.927 --> 01:40:51.367
Aww, that's so cute.

01:40:51.368 --> 01:40:53.761
Is my baby trying to lose some weight?

01:40:53.762 --> 01:40:55.682
I guess you can say that.

01:40:55.683 --> 01:40:58.032
I only have time for four rounds
of breakfast this morning.

01:40:58.033 --> 01:40:59.371
I gotta meet up with Alex.

01:40:59.372 --> 01:41:01.593
Hey how's he doing anyway
after the other night?

01:41:01.594 --> 01:41:05.176
He seemed really upset and
pretty sure he's avoiding us.

01:41:05.177 --> 01:41:07.767
He's been a little weird lately.

01:41:07.768 --> 01:41:11.759
Since the whole thingy between you.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:12.924
What do you mean?

01:41:12.925 --> 01:41:14.010
I don't know.

01:41:14.011 --> 01:41:17.549
What'd you guys get it on or something?

01:41:17.557 --> 01:41:19.230
Don't be a silly willy.

01:41:19.231 --> 01:41:20.765
He came to the bar last night.

01:41:20.766 --> 01:41:24.083
He drank way too much, so
we put him on the couch

01:41:24.084 --> 01:41:25.335
and I think about midnight

01:41:25.336 --> 01:41:28.700
he came into our room
crying, asking for his mommy.

01:41:28.701 --> 01:41:30.739
It's really sad he's
never had a mother figure.

01:41:30.740 --> 01:41:32.082
You know, we've really
enjoyed raising him

01:41:32.083 --> 01:41:33.842
over the last few years.

01:41:33.843 --> 01:41:35.676
He's like a son to us.

01:41:37.445 --> 01:41:40.326
I'm gonna miss having you
guys around all the time.

01:41:40.327 --> 01:41:41.160
Miss us?

01:41:41.161 --> 01:41:42.528
What are you talking about?

01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:43.821
You're not planning on moving?

01:41:43.822 --> 01:41:45.267
Who'm I going to cook for?

01:41:45.268 --> 01:41:46.101
No, no, no, no, no.

01:41:46.102 --> 01:41:48.196
I'm just saying that you
guys are really awesome

01:41:48.197 --> 01:41:50.456
and I love you so much.

01:41:50.457 --> 01:41:51.606
Aw, babe.

01:41:51.607 --> 01:41:54.690
We love you too.
We love you too.

01:42:02.678 --> 01:42:04.346
You see him?

01:42:04.347 --> 01:42:06.847
No, he's not here obviously.

01:42:10.034 --> 01:42:14.276
So I did that triathlon
you were training for.

01:42:14.885 --> 01:42:15.768
Yeah?

01:42:15.768 --> 01:42:16.601
Yeah.

01:42:16.602 --> 01:42:20.969
I actually hired this crazy
foreign dude off of Craigslist.

01:42:20.970 --> 01:42:23.491
He kept talking shit to
me in another language

01:42:23.492 --> 01:42:26.311
and was like throwing
fruits and vegetable at me

01:42:26.312 --> 01:42:28.145
when we were training.

01:42:30.027 --> 01:42:33.218
I actually lost the race.

01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:35.439
But I finished.

01:42:36.266 --> 01:42:38.699
They even gave me this cool medal.

01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:39.914
You finished the race?

01:42:39.915 --> 01:42:42.450
Like from start to finish?

01:42:42.451 --> 01:42:45.551
Yeah, but like I said I lost.

01:42:45.874 --> 01:42:47.007
Who cares man?

01:42:47.008 --> 01:42:48.929
You finished a triathlon.

01:42:48.930 --> 01:42:50.451
Like how many people can
say they've done that?

01:42:50.452 --> 01:42:52.093
That's pretty fucking awesome.

01:42:52.094 --> 01:42:53.594
I'm proud of you, man.

01:42:53.595 --> 01:42:54.428
Thanks.

01:42:55.351 --> 01:42:56.752
And I know when you came
by the tent the other day

01:42:56.753 --> 01:42:58.633
it looked like something went
down between me and Holly,

01:42:58.634 --> 01:43:00.700
but nothing happened I swear.

01:43:00.701 --> 01:43:03.220
I mean besides me being
overdosed on the weed brownies

01:43:03.221 --> 01:43:04.614
that she poisoned me with,

01:43:04.615 --> 01:43:07.214
I couldn't even get a
hard on if I tried.

01:43:07.215 --> 01:43:09.557
Wait, you got high?

01:43:09.938 --> 01:43:11.849
Yeah, I don't want to talk about it man.

01:43:11.850 --> 01:43:14.005
Oh, I bet Holly gave
you those weed brownies

01:43:14.006 --> 01:43:15.539
I was cooking up.

01:43:15.540 --> 01:43:17.012
They had shrooms in them.

01:43:17.013 --> 01:43:19.014
You were probably tripping balls.

01:43:19.015 --> 01:43:20.138
Yeah.

01:43:20.139 --> 01:43:23.901
So let's talk about what happened
between you and your mom?

01:43:23.902 --> 01:43:26.223
You know, your mother?

01:43:26.224 --> 01:43:28.463
The woman who gave birth to you?

01:43:28.464 --> 01:43:30.962
You didn't have sex with
her by any chance, did you?

01:43:30.963 --> 01:43:33.643
I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

01:43:33.644 --> 01:43:35.188
Yeah, you do.

01:43:35.189 --> 01:43:36.270
You're mom told me.

01:43:36.271 --> 01:43:39.341
You did her and Shaniqua dirty.

01:43:39.342 --> 01:43:42.897
Even if there were true, which it's not,

01:43:42.898 --> 01:43:45.017
how could I even have sex with my mom?

01:43:45.018 --> 01:43:45.851
I'm not even me.

01:43:45.852 --> 01:43:46.967
I'm not even Matt.

01:43:46.968 --> 01:43:49.344
I'm not...
Hey, hey, hey.

01:43:49.345 --> 01:43:50.306
Relax bro.

01:43:50.307 --> 01:43:51.427
I'm just messing with you.

01:43:51.428 --> 01:43:52.590
I wanted to see your face.

01:43:52.591 --> 01:43:54.967
See my face, whatever.

01:43:54.968 --> 01:43:56.701
Nothing happened, all right?

01:43:56.702 --> 01:43:57.944
Nothing happened?

01:43:57.945 --> 01:43:59.704
Yeah, nothing.

01:43:59.705 --> 01:44:00.706
Are you sure?

01:44:00.707 --> 01:44:02.174
Yes.

01:44:02.175 --> 01:44:05.620
Thank god.

01:44:05.621 --> 01:44:07.826
You know that comedy show
you were practicing for?

01:44:07.827 --> 01:44:09.801
I did that, I didn't get first place

01:44:09.802 --> 01:44:11.045
but you are now the proud owner

01:44:11.046 --> 01:44:13.407
of three free comedy workshop classes,

01:44:13.408 --> 01:44:14.848
so, you're welcome.

01:44:14.849 --> 01:44:16.129
Fucking, fuck yeah.

01:44:16.130 --> 01:44:17.171
Awesome.

01:44:17.172 --> 01:44:18.673
I'm gonna give you those for Christmas.

01:44:18.674 --> 01:44:19.713
Wow, thank you.

01:44:19.714 --> 01:44:21.478
That's amazing.

01:44:21.479 --> 01:44:22.571
Can't wait.

01:44:22.572 --> 01:44:23.851
And I'm proud of you.

01:44:23.852 --> 01:44:25.119
You must've done a lot of work

01:44:25.120 --> 01:44:27.830
because you were fucking terrible.

01:44:27.831 --> 01:44:30.243
Yeah, I worked pretty hard on it.

01:44:30.244 --> 01:44:32.353
No, I mean you were the worst.

01:44:32.354 --> 01:44:36.525
Like watching you tell a
joke was like getting fisted

01:44:36.526 --> 01:44:39.745
by someone wearing Hulk hands.

01:44:39.746 --> 01:44:41.961
I get it, I was bad, all right?

01:44:41.962 --> 01:44:44.212
Yeah, fucking unbearable.

01:44:49.405 --> 01:44:53.198
I'm sorry I thought you
slept with my girlfriend.

01:44:53.199 --> 01:44:54.673
Should've trusted you.

01:44:54.674 --> 01:44:57.682
Yeah, I'm sorry that...

01:44:59.442 --> 01:45:00.609
I'm sorry too.

01:45:02.553 --> 01:45:04.008
I shouldn't have said the things I said.

01:45:04.009 --> 01:45:07.084
I was just angry, being a dumb ass.

01:45:07.085 --> 01:45:08.010
We cool?

01:45:08.943 --> 01:45:10.246
Yeah, we cool.

01:45:19.171 --> 01:45:21.254
Oh shit, it's Magic Mike.

01:45:30.190 --> 01:45:31.107
What the?

01:45:32.163 --> 01:45:32.996
Crap.

01:45:41.489 --> 01:45:43.489
It said it's right here.

01:45:45.738 --> 01:45:46.571
Come on.

01:45:47.926 --> 01:45:49.118
Come on.

01:45:49.119 --> 01:45:49.952
Gotcha.

01:45:49.956 --> 01:45:51.506
Ha, yes.

01:46:04.817 --> 01:46:06.392
Holy shit.

01:46:06.393 --> 01:46:09.498
I hope your hobo legs are
broken, you fucking asshole.

01:46:11.859 --> 01:46:13.542
Come on, wake up.

01:46:13.543 --> 01:46:15.214
Quit fucking around.

01:46:15.215 --> 01:46:16.531
You gotta change us back, dude.

01:46:16.532 --> 01:46:17.365
Come on.

01:46:17.366 --> 01:46:19.031
Come here. Come here.

01:46:21.325 --> 01:46:22.788
You feel anything?

01:46:22.789 --> 01:46:24.232
No, do you?

01:46:24.233 --> 01:46:25.248
No.
