WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:04.372
I don't want to spend anytime
in a Laotian prison camp

00:04.438 --> 00:06.349
for invading their sovereign airspace.

00:09.376 --> 00:10.582
[machine guns firing]

00:14.114 --> 00:16.151
I'd go through hell to get Sin Jin out.

00:16.817 --> 00:17.887
[chuckling]

00:19.453 --> 00:21.262
Come in, Dom. We're pinned down. Come in.

00:21.321 --> 00:22.459
[guns firing]

00:22.523 --> 00:23.968
I'm gonna blow the road in front of us.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.300
Careful, String. What if
Sin Jin is in that truck?

00:28.000 --> 00:34.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:30.717 --> 02:32.094
Excuse me.

02:45.632 --> 02:47.134
(Tommy) Hold it!

02:53.206 --> 02:55.243
Move before you get hurt.

02:56.276 --> 02:57.346
[speaking Thai]

03:07.688 --> 03:09.326
Thank you, Tommy.

03:13.660 --> 03:15.662
[men chattering]

03:27.107 --> 03:28.780
See what he's got.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.683
Not so much as a fare-thee-well, Hawke?

03:34.948 --> 03:36.859
Show him the photographs.

03:36.983 --> 03:38.291
[speaking Thai]

03:38.852 --> 03:40.422
He wants the money first.

03:40.487 --> 03:44.060
These refugees know the value
of cash on the barrelhead.

03:46.126 --> 03:47.503
[speaking Thai]

03:48.428 --> 03:50.271
The price was agreed.

03:52.199 --> 03:54.042
He wants $2,000 now.

03:54.101 --> 03:55.603
(Stringfellow) That's par for the course.

03:56.436 --> 03:57.938
[man laughing]

04:00.807 --> 04:03.515
If he has what I want, it's worth it.

04:04.878 --> 04:06.357
Show it to him.

04:14.521 --> 04:17.399
You're always saying the Firm's
never done anything for you.

04:17.457 --> 04:19.197
Keep on saying it.

04:31.805 --> 04:34.012
That's him. That's Sin Jin.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.318
I couldn't tell, the photograph's so grainy.

04:44.651 --> 04:46.597
The figure's in shadow.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.432
I know my own brother.

04:50.524 --> 04:53.471
Sometimes we see what we want to see, Hawke.

04:54.728 --> 04:57.971
Anyway, that prison camp isn't even government.

04:58.031 --> 05:00.739
It belongs to some local warlord.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.610
But it's deep in Laos.

05:02.669 --> 05:05.650
Politically, it's information we can't act on.

05:06.006 --> 05:09.681
However, if you know someone who can…

05:13.680 --> 05:15.318
Good luck, Hawke.

05:16.183 --> 05:17.423
Michael.

05:19.853 --> 05:21.230
Thank you.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.430
For what?

05:38.104 --> 05:40.277
Laos is Communist territory.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.446
One of the most heavily
armed countries on Earth.

05:46.613 --> 05:49.253
I've been waiting for this
the better part of my life.

05:51.585 --> 05:54.122
I'd go through hell to get Sin Jin out.

05:56.122 --> 05:57.601
[speaking Thai]

06:04.064 --> 06:06.374
There's so many Communist troops in that place,

06:06.433 --> 06:09.437
it'll take a whole Marine
Division to crack ‘em.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.379
What if we put together
a small, specialized unit?

06:14.040 --> 06:17.283
Just zip right in there,
snatch him out and be gone.

06:17.344 --> 06:20.985
Yeah? And what about supplies, ammunition?

06:21.348 --> 06:23.225
Where you gonna get ‘em?

06:26.853 --> 06:28.457
I'll sell a painting.

06:28.521 --> 06:30.728
Hell, I'll sell them all if I have to.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.599
Well, it might just work.

06:32.659 --> 06:34.366
If you had John Wayne with you.

06:34.427 --> 06:36.873
[scoffs] Where are you
gonna find a bunch of guys

06:36.930 --> 06:40.207
who are trained in this kind
of stuff on such short notice?

06:40.267 --> 06:41.541
(Announcer) Well, we're down to the final laps

06:41.601 --> 06:42.944
of the last heat, ladies and gentlemen.

06:43.003 --> 06:45.745
It's been one of the toughest and
a grueling season for these men.

06:45.805 --> 06:49.275
Number 98 Mike Willamite takes a header
off the bumps leaving the field wide open

06:49.342 --> 06:50.946
for the number 2 and 3 man.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.423
The track is heating up
as we get into the last lap.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.484
Now, 16, Lancaster pulls up
to the 3rd pole position

06:56.549 --> 06:59.689
as these 3 fight it out for dominance
in the Olive County Dirt Bike Rally.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.529
It's been a thrilling night for all
the competitors as well as the fans,

07:02.589 --> 07:03.932
who've followed them from the beginning.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.664
And the winner is Sebastian Robmiger-Kinney.

07:06.726 --> 07:08.967
Robmiger was hiding there
throughout the season,

07:09.029 --> 07:11.532
never placing higher than 2nd
with his sheer determination.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.976
And let's hope this works…

07:14.034 --> 07:17.880
I don't know, Hawke. It's been over
10 years since I handled an M-16.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.812
Now, we've changed a lot since Nam.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.114
Now, I don't mean slowed down.

07:22.175 --> 07:24.655
I mean just… changed.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.749
He sure could use you.

07:29.549 --> 07:30.755
[sighs]

07:31.451 --> 07:32.930
When do we go?

07:33.186 --> 07:34.688
[chuckling]

07:41.661 --> 07:43.197
(Wallace on TV) And this great nation of ours

07:43.263 --> 07:46.608
has always cherished its
many national resources.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.943
Let us not just preserve our environment,

07:50.003 --> 07:54.076
but enhance it for the benefit
of all our future generations.

07:54.474 --> 07:58.422
It is the one legacy we must
pass on to our children

07:58.678 --> 08:02.285
and to our children's children, for all time.

08:02.682 --> 08:03.717
Thank you.

08:03.783 --> 08:05.524
[audience applauding]

08:06.286 --> 08:07.526
Thank you.

08:10.190 --> 08:11.396
Are you kidd’n?

08:11.458 --> 08:14.371
The next Senator of this
state is com’n with us?

08:14.594 --> 08:15.800
No way.

08:16.730 --> 08:20.200
He owes as much to Sin Jin
as the rest of us. Maybe more.

08:20.567 --> 08:21.705
We need him.

08:23.636 --> 08:26.549
Gary Wallace can get us visas, permits.

08:26.606 --> 08:29.780
Without his political help,
things’ll be a lot tougher.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.154
He was one of us once.

08:35.315 --> 08:37.158
(Stringfellow) Maybe he won't forget.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.335
Hell, I'm glad that's over.

08:45.625 --> 08:48.629
So, it's good to see you guys again. Really is.

08:49.162 --> 08:50.539
My name is Dominic Santini.

08:50.597 --> 08:51.598
Nice to meet you, sir.

08:51.664 --> 08:53.371
- How are you?
- Fine, thanks.

08:54.467 --> 08:57.573
Hawke, I've given your plan a lot of thought.

08:58.938 --> 08:59.973
Did you buy it?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.713
I just can't go along with it.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.517
We got a few bumps to work out.

09:04.577 --> 09:07.148
There's not a chance in a
million you'll pull it off.

09:09.249 --> 09:11.160
Well, we'll do it somehow.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.323
Hey, come on, Hawke, stop it.
This is complete madness.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.025
It just cannot be done.

09:16.089 --> 09:18.865
Handful of men against an
entire garrison? Come on!

09:20.060 --> 09:22.233
No explanations or apologies.

09:23.363 --> 09:25.138
Good to see you again.

09:28.134 --> 09:29.772
Good luck, Senator.

09:32.005 --> 09:33.609
Hey, wait a minute, huh?

09:34.140 --> 09:36.211
You guys'll never get back without me.

09:36.342 --> 09:37.787
[scoffing]

09:39.612 --> 09:41.683
- Hey, it's going to be a ball.
- Yeah, right, right, right.

09:41.748 --> 09:43.523
[all laughing] Come on.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.464
(Stringfellow) This is a replica of
the camp that we've reconstructed

09:49.522 --> 09:51.968
from 2-month-old surveillance photos.

09:52.759 --> 09:54.136
2 months?

09:54.694 --> 09:56.503
Everything could've changed by now.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.440
You know, more guards.

09:58.498 --> 10:00.239
You know how they moved us around.

10:00.300 --> 10:01.870
The prisoners, they might not even be there.

10:01.935 --> 10:03.676
We know where they are.

10:04.170 --> 10:06.844
Before we move, we'll have
up-to-date reconnaissance.

10:06.906 --> 10:08.351
You got any other questions?

10:08.408 --> 10:10.183
Yeah, I got a couple.

10:10.243 --> 10:12.689
Like, who's gonna take out these guard towers?

10:12.745 --> 10:13.780
I'll handle it.

10:13.847 --> 10:14.882
And the guard barracks?

10:14.948 --> 10:17.929
Helicopter pad, armed jeeps,
snipers, ground fire.

10:17.984 --> 10:19.463
You're gonna handle all that, too?

10:19.519 --> 10:21.021
Yeah, I got it covered.

10:21.087 --> 10:24.591
String, call this madness
off before it's too late.

10:25.325 --> 10:27.805
He's right, Hawke. It's impossible.

10:28.361 --> 10:30.102
I told you, I'll handle it.

10:30.563 --> 10:31.906
[sighs]

10:33.733 --> 10:37.510
You're right, Wallace. There's no
way Hawke could cover all that.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.087
[engine humming]

10:51.151 --> 10:52.562
What the hell?

11:15.308 --> 11:16.878
[engine revving]

11:33.993 --> 11:35.301
[chuckling]

11:37.197 --> 11:39.370
Well, what are we all waiting for?

11:39.732 --> 11:41.143
Let's go get Sin Jin.

12:01.454 --> 12:05.231
(Dominic) We've got Tonkin Bay to
the north. We're on course for Laos.

12:16.469 --> 12:19.279
(Stringfellow) Well, there's the
Mekong Delta. For better or worse.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.945
We're in Laos. Keep a sharp eye out for bogeys.

12:24.644 --> 12:26.055
Start cameras.

12:28.414 --> 12:30.553
(Stringfellow) Run infrared,
thermal and standards.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.924
Infrared, thermal, and standard.

12:33.987 --> 12:35.489
[buzzing]

12:45.198 --> 12:46.472
[beeping]

12:47.800 --> 12:49.746
(Dominic) All strokes tracking.

13:01.814 --> 13:04.090
[mechanical whirring]

13:17.930 --> 13:19.705
- How’s it look?
- Done.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.973
Let's get outta here. We can analyze later.

13:22.568 --> 13:23.876
I'm gonna go in.

13:24.737 --> 13:26.375
I gotta find out what they really got.

13:26.439 --> 13:29.886
I knew it, I knew it.
You just couldn't resist it.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.589
Oh, pray for me, Mother.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.098
Just keep it bolted to the treetops, partner.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.733
I don't wanna spend any time in a Laotian jail

13:51.798 --> 13:53.744
for invading their sovereign airspace.

14:17.657 --> 14:19.034
[machine guns firing]

14:48.187 --> 14:50.463
You've seen enough? Let's get outta here.

14:55.194 --> 14:57.037
[machine guns firing]

15:00.933 --> 15:03.311
They're well-armed. At least we learned that.

15:06.372 --> 15:09.717
Now, I just want to know how you
plan on getting into that camp.

15:10.576 --> 15:11.748
Walk.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.582
Here they are.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.886
- Here we are.
- Hey.

15:51.284 --> 15:53.025
(Stringfellow) Did you ever think
you'd see this place again?

15:53.085 --> 15:54.428
- No.
- Hi. How are you?

15:54.487 --> 15:57.195
- Just like R & R, right, Wallace?
- You bet.

15:57.256 --> 15:58.860
Hey, let's get your stuff
stowed in the hotel here.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.336
I'll take you over to meet Chin Mao.

16:00.393 --> 16:01.667
Let's do it.

16:02.695 --> 16:04.402
[car horns honking]

16:13.673 --> 16:15.550
[people chattering]

16:24.784 --> 16:26.764
(Kearns) Tom yum kung!

16:26.819 --> 16:29.299
[clears throat] This stuff is pretty good.

16:33.159 --> 16:35.696
Hey, Wallace. Relax.

16:36.229 --> 16:38.470
Enjoy the surroundings while
you still have a chance, huh?

16:38.865 --> 16:40.173
Well, even in Bangkok,

16:40.233 --> 16:42.076
4 Americans with a warehouse full of weapons

16:42.134 --> 16:43.807
could draw a bit of attention.

16:43.870 --> 16:46.043
He's right. If we ever get caught,

16:46.105 --> 16:48.608
we could spend the rest of
our lives in a Bangkok jail

16:48.941 --> 16:51.285
following elephants with a shovel.

16:52.245 --> 16:54.885
Well, I'm in favor of
starting as soon as we can.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.153
Ditto.

16:56.215 --> 16:59.526
(Kearns) This Thai brew hasn't gotten
any worse over the years, has it?

17:00.119 --> 17:01.723
(Stringfellow) Neither has she.

17:16.335 --> 17:17.905
It's been a long time, Hawke.

17:19.105 --> 17:20.448
Too long.

17:22.808 --> 17:26.085
Gentlemen, meet Charmaine Beaucaire.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.224
- This is Jack Kearns.
- Hello.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.488
Gary Wallace.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.790
- Hello.
- Hello.

17:32.151 --> 17:33.653
- [speaking French]
- And Dominic Santini.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.598
- Would you care to sit?
- No. Merci, Monsieur Santini.

17:36.656 --> 17:38.932
[speaking French]

17:41.427 --> 17:43.964
It's a small team for what
you have in mind, Hawke.

17:45.031 --> 17:46.942
That's why we need an expert guide.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.015
Gentlemen, meet Chin Mao.

18:02.982 --> 18:05.519
[music playing on radio]

18:05.585 --> 18:07.030
[rattling]

18:16.529 --> 18:17.599
I tell you,

18:18.431 --> 18:21.002
I think Kearns would be
late for his own funeral.

18:21.067 --> 18:22.978
He probably got himself in trouble.

18:24.003 --> 18:27.541
If the Thai police have him, we'll never
get him out in time for this mission.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.553
[Kearns singing]

18:38.117 --> 18:40.427
You know a better cover than
being an American tourist?

18:47.860 --> 18:49.601
[metallic clanging]

18:50.930 --> 18:52.204
Shovels?

18:57.970 --> 19:00.712
Now that's the kind of farm work I like.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.852
Well, what do we have here?

19:16.689 --> 19:19.363
Okay, since none of you have to be here,

19:19.425 --> 19:23.202
I'd like to just take a
second to tell you thanks.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.906
Tomorrow we're gonna go in and get Sin Jin

19:25.965 --> 19:28.673
and any other Americans
we can, out of that camp.

19:29.702 --> 19:31.272
But I'll tell you,

19:32.405 --> 19:34.976
there's nobody else on Earth
I'd rather go in with.

19:36.642 --> 19:38.451
[banging on door]

19:41.614 --> 19:44.925
Hey, you guys, get those weapons loaded, now.

19:45.418 --> 19:47.056
[banging on door] Hurry up!

19:47.953 --> 19:49.523
Get it. Let's go.

[speaking French]

19:53.192 --> 19:54.762
[speaking French]

19:55.461 --> 19:56.599
Customs.

19:56.762 --> 19:58.070
Stall ‘em.

20:01.400 --> 20:02.606
[speaking Thai]

20:18.117 --> 20:19.858
Very interesting group.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.097
Is there a problem here?

20:23.089 --> 20:24.932
I want to check your equipment.

20:26.225 --> 20:30.970
Oh, it's just farm equipment
for my chateau in the country.

20:38.304 --> 20:41.183
Your friend got something against agriculture?

20:41.707 --> 20:44.119
Very interesting vehicle for tourists.

20:45.010 --> 20:47.183
Kearns, why don't you show him how it works?

20:48.380 --> 20:49.450
Stop!

20:49.515 --> 20:50.721

[siren wailing]

20:54.220 --> 20:55.927

20:57.490 --> 21:00.334
(Kearns) Hop in! Come on,
let's go, let's go, let's go!

21:00.392 --> 21:03.305
Keep your head down.
We're out of here. Let's go!

21:41.233 --> 21:42.837
[engine humming]

21:57.683 --> 21:58.855
Let's go.

23:03.716 --> 23:05.559
(Stringfellow) Punji sticks.

23:06.518 --> 23:07.826
For hunting?

23:08.120 --> 23:09.997
These can't be left over from the war.

23:10.055 --> 23:11.398
No, they're new.

23:11.891 --> 23:14.098
Whoever put them there is saying,

23:14.326 --> 23:16.431
"Any further, and you risk your life."

23:16.495 --> 23:17.530
Yeah, but who'd bother?

23:17.596 --> 23:20.440
This is nothing but a freeway
for lizards and rats.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.069
Why don't you ask him?

23:26.939 --> 23:28.976
Don't anybody move.

23:29.041 --> 23:31.385
I ain't even gonna breathe.

23:32.311 --> 23:33.722

[man ordering in Thai]

24:48.887 --> 24:50.958
[speaking Thai]

24:51.724 --> 24:54.500
He asks if you are American mercenaries.

24:57.763 --> 24:58.901
No.

25:00.032 --> 25:02.808
We're combat archaeologists on a field trip.

25:04.403 --> 25:06.144
[Charmaine speaks Thai]

[speaking Thai]

25:07.706 --> 25:08.776
[chuckling]

25:11.377 --> 25:12.981
What'd he say?

25:13.846 --> 25:16.690
Something to me which I will not translate.

25:18.317 --> 25:21.821
Well, you tell him I don't
care for his hospitality.

25:23.655 --> 25:25.464
[speaking Thai]

25:25.758 --> 25:28.568
You can also tell him if he
doesn't get his act together,

25:28.627 --> 25:30.664
I'm not gonna do business with him.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.142
[speaking Thai]

25:36.802 --> 25:38.713
[speaking Thai]

25:39.204 --> 25:42.549
(Charmaine) He says, "What is this
business, before I kill you?"

25:42.741 --> 25:45.381
American POWs, Prisoners of War.

25:45.911 --> 25:47.515
[speaking Thai]

25:47.613 --> 25:49.752
Tell him, if he knows where they are,

25:49.815 --> 25:51.988
I'll pay him in American money.

25:53.619 --> 25:55.326
[speaking Thai]

25:55.587 --> 25:56.657
[speaking Thai]

25:56.722 --> 25:58.360
He wants to know where the money is.

25:58.457 --> 25:59.663
First we deal.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.335
To show good faith.

26:08.467 --> 26:10.378
[people murmuring]

26:17.342 --> 26:18.377
There's more.

[speaking Thai]

26:32.224 --> 26:33.897
[people murmuring]

26:35.694 --> 26:37.935

[bird screeching]

28:07.152 --> 28:09.632

28:09.788 --> 28:11.768
So terribly continental.

28:11.823 --> 28:12.961
[chuckling]

28:13.525 --> 28:16.563
[in French accent] You know,
nothing but the best for my team.

28:17.396 --> 28:20.002
Well, where's the champagne, hmm?

28:20.499 --> 28:21.944
Don't you worry about it.

28:22.000 --> 28:24.742
We get Sin Jin out tomorrow,
we'll be swimming in it.

28:28.140 --> 28:29.619
To Sin Jin.

28:29.875 --> 28:31.286
- Yeah.
- Huh?

28:31.343 --> 28:33.254
- (Dominic) I'll drink to that.
- To...

28:34.279 --> 28:35.349
[chuckling]

28:35.414 --> 28:37.121
[all chuckling] Well, it's about time.

28:37.182 --> 28:39.128
Are we glad to see you.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.527
Hell, I got her all bedded down.

28:41.587 --> 28:44.329
She's camouflaged and
fueled up and ready to go.

28:45.891 --> 28:47.495
Then tomorrow we do it.

28:47.893 --> 28:49.531
Yep. Tomorrow.

29:06.812 --> 29:08.553
Nice and peaceful.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.892
Let's go.

29:28.066 --> 29:29.306
(Kearns) Wallace.

30:43.442 --> 30:45.615
[whispering] Wallace, come on.

31:06.998 --> 31:09.672
They're Asians. Where are the Americans?

31:10.369 --> 31:12.007
Let's get outta here.

31:14.973 --> 31:16.316
It's a trap.

31:16.942 --> 31:18.353
They're prisoners.

31:19.578 --> 31:21.353
The Cong know we're here.

31:21.947 --> 31:23.017
[panting]

31:23.081 --> 31:25.925
The Cong? What's the matter with you, Wallace?

31:25.984 --> 31:27.588
They always know.

31:32.691 --> 31:34.932
Come on. Let's get outta here.

31:42.434 --> 31:45.415
[panting]

[man speaking Vietnamese]

31:48.807 --> 31:50.912
[groaning]

31:56.748 --> 31:59.251
(Wallace) I can't stand it anymore. I'm sorry.

32:00.318 --> 32:02.457
I'm sorry man, I'm sorry.

32:02.721 --> 32:04.257
I'm sorry.

32:05.457 --> 32:06.993
It was me, Kearnsie.

32:07.058 --> 32:08.799
What do you mean? What was you?

32:09.060 --> 32:10.937
I sold you out.

32:10.996 --> 32:12.236
(Kearns) What?

32:14.032 --> 32:18.538
I sold you out man. I told them about
the… I told them about the break.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.911
The tunnel, I told them where it was.

32:22.974 --> 32:26.512
You buried me in that
hellhole for another year?

32:28.547 --> 32:30.549
I just couldn't stand it anymore.

32:35.487 --> 32:39.435
We had the tunnel finished. We were home.

32:40.425 --> 32:42.996
I just thought if I came
back here, I'd make it up.

32:43.061 --> 32:46.099
Nothing you do is gonna make
up for all you did, Wallace.

32:48.433 --> 32:49.503
No!

33:51.630 --> 33:56.306
I bit my tongue until it bled.
I tried to pass out. I tried.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.008
We all almost broke, but we didn't.

34:00.105 --> 34:01.550
I was too weak.

34:01.606 --> 34:03.279
Oh, no. No way.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.385
[machine guns firing]

34:07.779 --> 34:09.781
They're moving the prisoners out.

[Airwolf engine humming]

34:16.353 --> 34:17.458
All right.

34:47.452 --> 34:48.487
Move!

34:48.553 --> 34:51.033
Not him, he left us here.

34:51.590 --> 34:52.967
To hell with him.

34:53.024 --> 34:56.938
I need him. I need all of ya. Let's go.

34:57.462 --> 34:59.772
Let's get those prisoners moved out.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.354
- Watch it!
- Let's go.

35:24.756 --> 35:26.201
Come on, move it!

Come on, get in, get in, get in!

35:59.924 --> 36:02.063
[machine guns firing]

36:22.047 --> 36:23.458
Sin Jin?

36:23.548 --> 36:25.824
We didn't get him. I think he's in that truck.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.989
We got to cut him off before
they get to that bridge.

36:28.053 --> 36:30.260
We'll be facing whole divisions.
We'll never get him back.

36:36.795 --> 36:40.265
I don't show ‘em. The river road's a blank.

36:40.965 --> 36:43.036
No, they're down there. Just keep scann’n.

36:53.611 --> 36:55.557
[machine guns firing]

37:11.730 --> 37:14.176
We'll never knock ‘em out with small arms.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.439
We need Hawke and that chopper.

37:17.035 --> 37:19.037
We can't wait for Hawke.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.273
Wallace!

What the hell are you doing? Wallace!

38:21.199 --> 38:22.473
There they are.

38:24.636 --> 38:28.243
It's an old plantation road.
They're almost to the river.

38:48.993 --> 38:50.597
I'm gonna blow the road in front of ‘em.

Careful String, what if
Sin Jin is in that truck?

Give me the guns.

40:03.067 --> 40:06.640
Sin Jin Hawke. 1st Air Cav. Where is he?

40:07.538 --> 40:10.417
They took the others away just after the rains.

40:10.608 --> 40:12.815
When? Where?

40:13.845 --> 40:15.153
Don't know.

40:15.880 --> 40:19.327
Gone, all gone.

40:46.577 --> 40:47.988

Oh, Hawke.

40:54.118 --> 40:55.461

40:56.587 --> 41:00.160
Let's get them out of here.
Come on! Here! Let's go! Go!

[guns firing]

41:08.299 --> 41:10.176

- Got it!

42:56.641 --> 42:58.314
We're outta here.

43:10.888 --> 43:13.095
I'm not leaving without Sin Jin.

43:13.157 --> 43:15.137
Another time, String.

If you can you hear me,

43:31.142 --> 43:32.985
this is your brother, String.

43:35.413 --> 43:37.120
I'm coming back.

43:40.618 --> 43:43.155
Pal, I swear to God, I'm coming back.

43:59.270 --> 44:00.544
(man) Aim!

44:01.939 --> 44:03.213
Out.

44:03.574 --> 44:05.986
Aim. Out.

44:06.978 --> 44:09.117
Aim. Out.

44:10.281 --> 44:12.818
Order out.

44:13.050 --> 44:15.428
Freeze it. Out.

44:22.126 --> 44:24.106
[trumpet playing taps]

44:57.361 --> 44:58.635
Hell of a eulogy.

44:58.696 --> 45:01.233
Yeah. And I thought he was a coward.

45:02.333 --> 45:04.335
But he sure died a hero.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.640
Well, Cong made him crack one time.

45:07.438 --> 45:09.645
But what about all the other times?

45:11.075 --> 45:12.577
He was a hero.

45:16.414 --> 45:18.257
Anybody want a beer?

45:19.717 --> 45:21.628
Too many calories.

45:34.131 --> 45:35.633
Hey, Kearns?

45:39.270 --> 45:40.840
Maybe just one.

45:48.546 --> 45:49.684
You know, they say,

45:49.747 --> 45:51.852
[speaking Italian]

45:52.250 --> 45:55.754
"He who drinks with old
friends never puts on weight."

45:55.820 --> 45:57.493
That's an old Italian saying, you know.

45:57.555 --> 45:58.727
(Kearns) Yeah?

45:58.789 --> 46:00.359
