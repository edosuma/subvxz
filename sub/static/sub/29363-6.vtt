Go ahead.

three years ago...

16:52.386 --> 16:55.389
I just knew that I had met
the love of my life.

16:55.473 --> 16:58.893
And I'm pretty sure
you felt the same way.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.022
We were so in love.

17:03.105 --> 17:07.109
We talked about
getting married...

17:07.193 --> 17:09.028
and having kids.

17:11.197 --> 17:13.741
But you just destroyed it.

17:17.036 --> 17:20.498
When I became successful...

17:20.581 --> 17:21.749
you just‐‐

17:23.417 --> 17:25.670
you became jealous,

17:25.753 --> 17:29.090
petty, resentful,

17:29.173 --> 17:32.260
angry...

17:32.343 --> 17:35.263
and you destroyed
what we had.

17:37.765 --> 17:41.102
I felt like
you stopped loving me.

17:42.937 --> 17:46.315
You made me feel terrible
about myself.

17:46.399 --> 17:50.528
And you took away
the most important
thing to me‐‐

17:50.611 --> 17:51.988
us.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.904
Well, it's difficult

18:33.988 --> 18:37.908
when the person you're with
is more successful than you

18:37.992 --> 18:41.829
and...
more talented than you...

18:44.749 --> 18:48.919
...just generally
a better person than you.

18:49.003 --> 18:51.005
It changed me.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.470
I didn't recognize myself.

18:59.347 --> 19:01.682
I was jealous.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.813
And I'm sorry.

19:09.231 --> 19:11.025
But I need to get over you.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.199
I see these images.

19:18.282 --> 19:21.869
They're everywhere.

19:23.537 --> 19:28.084
Like, I'll be taking a walk...

19:28.167 --> 19:31.671
and I'll see the image of us.

19:33.589 --> 19:37.510
Or even if
I'm at a coffee shop,

19:37.593 --> 19:41.681
I'll turn around
and it'll be playing
on the wall.

19:43.432 --> 19:46.060
I can't get away from it.

19:48.354 --> 19:50.773
It's like
you're haunting me.

19:53.567 --> 19:56.445
And I understand why
you don't want to talk to me.

19:57.988 --> 20:00.074
But you can't
just shut me out.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.414
I still carry you with me.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.711

20:30.938 --> 20:33.441

or...?

It's ruined.
