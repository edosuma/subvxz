WEBVTT

00:01.349 --> 00:03.177
My name is Kara Zor-El.

00:03.220 --> 00:04.743
I'm from Krypton.

00:04.787 --> 00:06.963
I'm a refugee on this planet.

00:07.007 --> 00:09.357
I was sent to Earth
to protect my cousin.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.446
But my pod got knocked
off course.

00:11.489 --> 00:13.100
And by the time I got here,

00:13.143 --> 00:17.887
my cousin had already grown up
and become... Superman.

00:17.930 --> 00:20.324
I hid who I really was
until one day

00:20.368 --> 00:24.546
when an accident forced me
to reveal myself to the world.

00:24.589 --> 00:28.158
To most people, I'm a reporter
at CatCo Worldwide Media.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.769
But in secret I work
with my adopted sister

00:30.813 --> 00:33.946
and my friends to protect
my city from anyone
that means to cause it harm.

00:38.777 --> 00:40.910
I am Supergirl.

00:40.953 --> 00:41.954
[theme music playing]

00:43.130 --> 00:45.219
Previously onSupergirl...

00:45.262 --> 00:48.222
[Brainy] We're in a race
against Nyxly
to find seven Totems

00:48.265 --> 00:51.007
before she can use them
to wipe us out of existence.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.748
[Mr. Mxyzptlk] Courage,
Humanity, Truth,

00:52.791 --> 00:55.316
Destiny, Love, Dreams and Hope.

00:55.359 --> 00:58.406
[Lena] We now have three
of the seven Totems
in our possession.

00:58.449 --> 01:01.017
Humanity, Hope and Courage.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.932
And Nyxly has none.

01:02.975 --> 01:04.934
Nia hasn't had
any luck in Parthas
finding the Dream Totem.

01:04.977 --> 01:07.067
[Nyxly] Supergirl destroyed
the Hope Totem.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.069
Now the AllStone
will never be whole.

01:11.245 --> 01:12.898
"A secret admirer"?

01:15.814 --> 01:17.990
You didn't choose to be
the sister with powers.

01:18.034 --> 01:20.602
They're supposed
to be passed down
from mother to daughter.

01:20.645 --> 01:22.343
So how did someone
like you get them?

01:22.386 --> 01:24.040
You're not even a real woman.

01:29.001 --> 01:31.482
-And she took everything?
-[Nia] Mmm-hmm.

01:31.526 --> 01:34.311
But what my dad
didn't tell me was that
apparently he and Maeve

01:34.355 --> 01:37.619
got into some big blowout fight
over what she said to me
at Mom's funeral.

01:37.662 --> 01:40.143
In other words,
he took your side
when she denied your identity.

01:40.187 --> 01:42.145
Of course he did.
So she skipped town,

01:42.189 --> 01:45.888
took all of
Mom's books and journals
and research with her.

01:45.931 --> 01:48.108
So my search
for the Dream Totem was a bust.

01:48.151 --> 01:49.674
I'm back to square one.

01:49.718 --> 01:51.372
Then perhaps we should consider
a fresh start.

01:53.591 --> 01:56.159
You've been so focused
on finding the Dream Totem,

01:57.769 --> 01:59.728
maybe you should cast
a wider net.

01:59.771 --> 02:02.383
Simply open yourself
to whatever the Dream Realm
shows you.

02:02.426 --> 02:03.993
Hmm, seems kind of vague.

02:04.036 --> 02:05.908
If you doubt me,

02:05.951 --> 02:08.128
try my spinach pancakes.

02:08.171 --> 02:09.346
Hmm?

02:10.217 --> 02:11.870
Taste my genius.

02:12.436 --> 02:13.350
Fine.

02:24.231 --> 02:25.101
You okay?

02:26.058 --> 02:27.277
Yes, it worked.

02:28.148 --> 02:29.323
I saw an address.

02:29.366 --> 02:31.499
Um... Crippen University.

02:31.542 --> 02:34.241
-What do you think it means?
-I don't know.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.852
But whatever is there
is going to help me
find the Totem.

02:36.895 --> 02:37.983
Hmm.

02:42.466 --> 02:46.035
I know you went green full-time
because William's been
at the Tower

02:46.078 --> 02:48.211
but, um,
you should stick with it.

02:48.255 --> 02:49.212
It makes you a better cook.

02:51.693 --> 02:52.694
Hmm.

02:53.825 --> 02:56.654
Interesting frock you got me.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.395
Who are you?

02:58.439 --> 03:01.529
Your secret admirer sent you
more than a frock.

03:01.572 --> 03:02.486
He sent me.

03:10.581 --> 03:11.974
[woman laughs]

03:12.017 --> 03:14.933
Can't you tell,
Princess Nyxlygsptlnz?

03:14.977 --> 03:15.804
I'm you.

03:16.631 --> 03:18.459
[chuckles]

03:19.111 --> 03:20.200
Me?

03:21.462 --> 03:22.854
That's impossible.

03:22.898 --> 03:25.379
[chuckles] Is it?

03:25.422 --> 03:28.556
When you were
in your tenth year, you had
a crush on Mxyzptlk's cousin,

03:28.599 --> 03:31.080
Duke Nzykmlk.

03:31.123 --> 03:34.562
You'd whisper his name
to your pillow.

03:34.605 --> 03:36.172
Never told anyone, did you?

03:37.129 --> 03:38.261
How did you...

03:38.305 --> 03:40.916
I can't tell you yet.

03:40.959 --> 03:45.616
For now, let's simply say
I know you think all is lost.

03:45.660 --> 03:48.532
But you can have
everything you want.

03:48.576 --> 03:51.970
All we have to do
is claim the Dream Totem.

03:52.014 --> 03:54.190
And I know how.

03:54.234 --> 03:57.324
So are you ready
to believe in yourself?

04:06.333 --> 04:07.377
Okay.

04:07.421 --> 04:09.423
I come bearing gifts.

04:09.466 --> 04:11.207
This is for you.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.513
[laughs]

04:12.556 --> 04:14.384
This for you.

04:14.428 --> 04:17.692
-[laughs]
-And of course,
last but not least, Supergirl.

04:17.735 --> 04:19.128
[Supergirl] Oh, my gosh.

04:19.171 --> 04:21.217
My niece is one heck
of an artist.

04:21.261 --> 04:23.132
I think you mean
my granddaughter.

04:23.175 --> 04:24.655
[Supergirl] Oh, is that her
and you?

04:24.699 --> 04:27.005
When do Esme and Kelly
get back from Calvintown?

04:27.049 --> 04:28.920
After the weekend.

04:28.964 --> 04:31.445
Kelly wants
to give Esme the full
Olsen family experience.

04:31.488 --> 04:35.884
So catching fireflies,
climbing trees,
the enormous chili bowls.

04:35.927 --> 04:38.060
So, if things stay as calm
as they have been,

04:38.103 --> 04:39.496
I think I'm just gonna
go back and join 'em.

04:39.540 --> 04:41.455
Yeah, I guess destroying
the Hope Totem

04:41.498 --> 04:43.805
and having Brainy hide the rest
was the right move.

04:43.848 --> 04:45.981
And now I even have time
for my interview.

04:46.024 --> 04:47.852
-What interview?
-Well, you know, Kaznia

04:47.896 --> 04:50.028
and Corto Maltese agreed
to a truce last week.

04:50.072 --> 04:54.990
Well, now, Prime Minister Perez
and President Zakharov
are in town

04:55.033 --> 04:56.992
negotiating
the official treaty.

04:57.035 --> 04:59.342
Yeah, and my sources
have told me that things
are getting tense.

04:59.386 --> 05:02.345
But then I remembered
this interview Larry King
did years ago

05:02.389 --> 05:04.129
with three
Middle Eastern leaders.

05:04.173 --> 05:06.654
Yeah, that was Arafat, Rabin
and King Hussein of Jordan.

05:06.697 --> 05:08.743
They called it
"World Diplomacy Live."

05:08.786 --> 05:11.049
I remember that.
Were you on Earth back then?

05:11.093 --> 05:14.879
No, I was actually in my pod,
but I saw it.

05:14.923 --> 05:18.318
I just remember being so moved
that a reporter

05:18.361 --> 05:20.363
could be a part of something
so momentous.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.105
So I went out on a limb
and asked Cat
if she'd be willing

05:23.148 --> 05:25.150
to introduce me
to the president
and prime minister

05:25.194 --> 05:27.022
and she said, "Yes."

05:27.065 --> 05:29.851
And now CatCo has the chance
to do something just like that.

05:29.894 --> 05:32.157
A once-in-a-generation
interview

05:32.201 --> 05:35.247
that will show that even
in these contentious times,

05:35.291 --> 05:37.772
two enemies were able
to cross the divide

05:37.815 --> 05:40.470
and come together
and help the Super Friends,

05:40.514 --> 05:45.562
by eliminating
both countries' threats
and, most importantly,

05:45.606 --> 05:48.391
how when people
really set their minds to it,

05:48.435 --> 05:51.002
real peace is possible.

05:51.046 --> 05:52.352
Wow.

05:52.395 --> 05:53.570
That is inspiring.

05:55.093 --> 05:57.400
But not really
interesting, is it?

05:57.444 --> 05:58.749
What?

05:58.793 --> 06:01.273
[stammers] Well,
this could be historic.

06:01.317 --> 06:03.101
[gasps] Oh, I know.

06:03.145 --> 06:07.410
We'll hype it as our version
of Oprah and the Royals.

06:07.454 --> 06:09.891
"Kara Danvers
and the heads of state."

06:09.934 --> 06:13.416
We'll put it on
all the platforms.
Our foreign markets will boom.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.897
Okay, but I-I really think
you're not getting this.

06:15.940 --> 06:19.422
Oh, but I am.
Tomorrow at the Civic Center,

06:19.466 --> 06:22.904
we will have a full crew
to support your broadcast.

06:22.947 --> 06:25.210
Anything you need before then,
you let me know.

06:25.254 --> 06:26.603
Okay. Bye.

06:34.219 --> 06:37.397
All right, Doctor Revee.
Let's see what you can tell me.

06:44.578 --> 06:45.405
Maeve?

06:54.414 --> 06:55.893
You tracked me down?

06:58.809 --> 07:00.202
Don't flatter yourself.

07:01.333 --> 07:03.292
I didn't know it was you.

07:03.335 --> 07:04.859
The name change
made sure of that.

07:07.775 --> 07:09.733
A dream led me here.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.822
Well, since you're here...

07:14.869 --> 07:17.132
I've been thinking
about things and...

07:19.177 --> 07:22.790
Look, I owe you an apology.

07:22.833 --> 07:25.140
-What I said to you
at Mom's funeral--
-Don't.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.144
Um...

07:29.187 --> 07:31.059
I'm not here
to talk about that.

07:31.102 --> 07:33.322
My dream showed me
that something here

07:33.365 --> 07:35.977
would lead me
to the Fifth-Dimensional
Totem of Dreaming.

07:36.020 --> 07:38.022
The Dream Totem?

07:38.066 --> 07:39.894
-It's real?
-What do you know about it?

07:39.937 --> 07:42.200
Allegedly, it's a relic
from another dimension

07:42.244 --> 07:45.160
that can bestow Dream power
to whoever wields it.

07:45.203 --> 07:49.294
-Do you know where it is?
-It's in the Dream Realm,
supposedly.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.296
But why are you looking for it?

07:51.340 --> 07:54.865
The fate of the universe
depends on me finding it
before Nyxly does.

07:54.909 --> 07:57.912
I need you to tell me
everything that you know
about this.

07:58.695 --> 07:59.870
[scoffs]

07:59.914 --> 08:02.351
Really?

08:02.394 --> 08:04.962
Yeah, that's like me asking you
to tell me everything
you know about journalism.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.356
Okay. Is there a book
I could read?

08:07.399 --> 08:08.270
Sure.

08:11.186 --> 08:12.274
Right here.

08:13.188 --> 08:14.668
Great.

08:14.711 --> 08:16.321
Which one?

08:16.365 --> 08:17.366
All of them.

08:26.810 --> 08:30.161
I think that is the fastest
I've ever seen anyone
watch a video.

08:30.205 --> 08:32.207
Yeah, it's 1.5 speed.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.252
It gets easier to follow
once you're used to it.

08:34.296 --> 08:36.559
-What's up?
-Well, I heard about your scoop

08:36.603 --> 08:39.693
and I wanted to offer
my services as a partner
for mock interviews.

08:39.736 --> 08:42.217
Back in London,
I was The Time's
point man on Kaznia,

08:42.260 --> 08:45.525
but I also did a big piece
on the corruption
in Corto Maltese.

08:45.568 --> 08:47.614
Yeah, that'd be great.

08:47.657 --> 08:51.226
And I will take you up on
as many practice interviews
as I can get.

08:51.269 --> 08:52.923
[phone chimes]

08:52.967 --> 08:54.969
Starting this afternoon.

08:55.012 --> 08:57.711
Because right now
I'm researching.

08:57.754 --> 08:59.582
That is the cardinal rule
of interviewing.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.279
Research, research, research.

09:02.454 --> 09:03.281
Right.

09:06.807 --> 09:08.373
[alarm blaring]

09:11.420 --> 09:14.031
Hmm.

09:14.075 --> 09:16.947
What does a sleeping man
have to do with me getting
the Dream Totem?

09:16.991 --> 09:20.690
Dr. Pavoni has created
a machine to get into
the Dream Realm.

09:20.734 --> 09:22.649
All you need to do
is access the machine

09:22.692 --> 09:25.521
and you can use the gauntlet
to access the Dream Realm.

09:25.565 --> 09:26.391
All right.

09:47.978 --> 09:49.632
No rest for the wicked, Nyxly.

09:49.676 --> 09:50.764
Use the gauntlet.

09:53.331 --> 09:55.943
Now use your Dream energy hand
to create the portal.

10:00.338 --> 10:01.775
Get into the Dream portal.

10:01.818 --> 10:04.342
Hear that?
Sounds like something's coming.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.344
[J'onn J'onzz] Nyxly's gone.

10:17.878 --> 10:18.966
[people screaming]

10:30.847 --> 10:34.634
Supergirl, J'onn. Brainy
just updated us. You're chasing
a "Nightmare monster?"

10:38.376 --> 10:41.118
Yes, and it's headed
toward a nuclear plant.

10:41.162 --> 10:42.816
Bringing up
the coordinates now.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.513
If it attacks the plant
and the core is compromised,

10:44.556 --> 10:46.515
that entire area
will be exposed to radiation.

10:46.558 --> 10:48.299
J'onn, can you calm
the creature?

10:53.261 --> 10:54.741
[J'onn J'onzz]
Nothing I can do
is stopping it.

10:54.784 --> 10:56.786
It's almost at the power plant.

10:56.830 --> 10:58.962
Lena, what about something
from your mother's
book of spells?

10:59.006 --> 11:02.226
Magic doesn't work that way.
It's a process
and I'm still learning.

11:02.270 --> 11:04.315
I could try something
old-school.

11:04.359 --> 11:06.709
When Lex was at the DEO,

11:06.753 --> 11:08.319
he developed a satellite-based
force field that could wall off
an entire city.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.191
If I could bypass
the satellite's security

11:10.234 --> 11:12.410
and re-route Dreamer's adaptors
to the feed,

11:12.454 --> 11:14.761
I could put up a dome
that not even that creature
could get through.

11:14.804 --> 11:17.024
Okay, but that'll trap
that thing in with
half the city.

11:17.067 --> 11:17.981
Do we have a choice?

11:18.895 --> 11:19.896
Supergirl?

11:22.246 --> 11:23.073
Do it!

11:44.181 --> 11:46.357
We did it. We trapped it.

11:48.359 --> 11:49.926
But now it's invisible.

11:56.324 --> 12:00.154
Writings on the Minoan
Oracle of Delphi suggest
the Dream Totem was housed

12:00.197 --> 12:01.982
in their main temple.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.767
When the Dorians invaded
in 1100 BC,

12:04.811 --> 12:08.423
the Oracle hid the Totem
in the safest place
she could think of.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.555
Dream Realm.

12:10.599 --> 12:13.341
Is there anything in there
that says what the Dream Totems
might be?

12:13.384 --> 12:15.125
None that I'm seeing.

12:15.169 --> 12:18.259
But since the Totem
was housed by the Minoans,

12:18.302 --> 12:21.088
the gauntlet may have
been replaced
with a kind of maze.

12:21.131 --> 12:22.567
Lucky for us,

12:22.611 --> 12:24.569
Mom was infatuated
with how Earth's cultures

12:24.613 --> 12:25.788
depicted the Dream Realms.

12:29.270 --> 12:32.447
Which led her to uncover this.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.884
It's a medieval tapestry
that supposedly depicts

12:34.928 --> 12:36.930
the Oracle's
original instructions.

12:36.973 --> 12:40.890
Allegedly, it can be deciphered
only by one of pure heart,

12:41.673 --> 12:43.806
mind and sight.

12:43.850 --> 12:45.808
And you understand all this?

12:45.852 --> 12:47.810
I've been studying
these things my whole life.

12:48.724 --> 12:50.030
Like this.

12:50.073 --> 12:53.033
It's a Naltorian symbol
for purity.

12:53.076 --> 12:54.121
Same as this.

12:55.165 --> 12:56.906
Where'd you get it?

12:56.950 --> 12:57.820
Mom.

12:59.691 --> 13:01.824
She said it would help
light up my dreams

13:01.868 --> 13:04.914
back when everyone
thought I'd be the Dreamer.

13:04.958 --> 13:09.658
It didn't do that,
but it did help spark
my interest in all of this.

13:10.746 --> 13:12.400
Must be nice.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.576
Having something to guide you
during unknown times.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.360
It is.

13:16.404 --> 13:17.840
Especially when
your whole world
gets flipped upside-down

13:17.884 --> 13:20.060
because someone's
keeping secrets.

13:20.103 --> 13:21.583
So what does the tree mean?

13:23.324 --> 13:25.761
Given its position,

13:25.805 --> 13:27.937
probably that the journey
to the Dream Totem

13:27.981 --> 13:30.244
starts in a forest somewhere.

13:30.287 --> 13:33.900
Lately, when I've been
entering my dreams,
I start in this forest.

13:33.943 --> 13:35.815
-Could that be it?
-It could.

13:35.858 --> 13:37.512
And what about
these other symbols?
What do they mean?

13:37.555 --> 13:39.035
To decipher the tapestry,

13:39.079 --> 13:41.168
you have to be able
to see the Dream Realm.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.866
So it's difficult for me
to say, but there are
some books

13:43.910 --> 13:44.824
that can help...

13:49.916 --> 13:52.788
You kept news clippings
about me?

13:52.832 --> 13:55.443
I might be furious with you,

13:55.486 --> 13:57.053
but you are still my sister.

14:02.929 --> 14:04.669
I have to take all of these?

14:05.583 --> 14:06.889
Plus a few more.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.765
Or you could come with me.

14:16.420 --> 14:18.031
Really?

14:18.074 --> 14:19.467
Look, like it or not,

14:19.510 --> 14:21.861
I can't decipher
this tapestry without you.

14:21.904 --> 14:23.471
And if I can't do that,

14:23.514 --> 14:25.865
then there's no way
I'm going to find the Totem.

14:28.345 --> 14:30.739
Just wanna text Brainy
and let him know the plan.

14:30.782 --> 14:33.089
My boyfriend,
he's a twelfth-level intellect.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.227
[clears throat]

14:40.270 --> 14:41.271
Are you coming?

14:55.372 --> 14:59.028
I crisscrossed the dome
a dozen times and couldn't
find that thing anywhere.

14:59.072 --> 15:01.596
-Please tell me
you had better luck.
-Unfortunately not.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.728
It appears that
when the creature
goes invisible,

15:03.772 --> 15:05.861
its energy signature does, too.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.907
My sense is it's either scared
or hiding.

15:07.950 --> 15:10.213
Better that than
terrorizing the locals.

15:10.257 --> 15:13.695
And people seem to be
staying inside, but who knows
how long that'll last?

15:13.738 --> 15:16.654
-We need to fix this now.
-Right.

15:16.698 --> 15:19.875
-How's it going over here?
-Very slowly.

15:19.919 --> 15:22.269
When Brainy took
Dr. Pavoni from
the sleep lab to the hospital,

15:22.312 --> 15:24.140
he discovered that his device
actually allows you

15:24.184 --> 15:26.316
to look into people's
dream spaces.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.492
So Nyxly was able
to piggyback on that
to get back in the Dream Realm.

15:28.536 --> 15:30.581
I'm hoping if we combine
the doctor's device

15:30.625 --> 15:32.322
with our portal technology,

15:32.366 --> 15:33.976
we can create what Nyxly did
so we can go in after her.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.587
Nyxly tricked Nia to get out
of the Dream Realm,

15:36.631 --> 15:38.241
why would she want
to go back in?

15:38.285 --> 15:39.982
[Brainy] Because that's where
the Dream Totem is.

15:40.026 --> 15:42.506
Nia had a dream flash
that led to her sister, Maeve,

15:42.550 --> 15:44.769
who told her the Dream Totem
is in there.

15:44.813 --> 15:46.815
She texted saying that
they're entering the Realm
now to go look for it.

15:46.858 --> 15:49.557
If Nyxly gets her hand
on that Dream Totem,

15:49.600 --> 15:53.039
she could access Dream Powers
even without the other Totems.

15:53.082 --> 15:54.605
That could
make her unstoppable.

15:54.649 --> 15:56.825
We need to get that portal up
and running fast.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.827
[buzzing]

16:01.047 --> 16:03.571
Uh, hey, William.
Yeah, of course

16:03.614 --> 16:05.703
-we're still on
for the mock interview.
-Go. Go.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.357
Lena and Brainy
can handle the portal.

16:07.401 --> 16:08.750
Alex and I will handle
the creature.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.578
We'll call
when we have something.

16:10.621 --> 16:12.101
Okay, William,
I'll see you soon.

16:14.277 --> 16:17.498
This forest reminds me
of that camping trip

16:17.541 --> 16:19.804
Mom took us on
in middle school.

16:19.848 --> 16:24.026
She forgot all the flashlights
so we had to sit
in the dark all night.

16:24.070 --> 16:27.682
The trees kept
scratching the tent
and you were terrified

16:27.725 --> 16:30.163
because you thought it was
some witch coming to get us.

16:30.206 --> 16:31.773
How much further do we have?

16:31.816 --> 16:34.254
I think we might have to go
beyond the forest.

16:35.342 --> 16:37.039
Beyond?

16:37.083 --> 16:39.172
There is an entire
Dream Expanse out there.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.087
You've never accessed it?

16:41.130 --> 16:43.915
Haven't you read
Of Dreams Beyond
or anything M.K. Nessler?

16:43.959 --> 16:47.049
You know, it wouldn't kill you
to crack open a book
every once in a while.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.182
Okay, Maeve,
if you're such an expert,

16:49.225 --> 16:51.488
-how do you access
the Dream Expanse?
-Don't turn this around on me.

16:51.532 --> 16:53.012
-Stop.
-You stop.

16:53.055 --> 16:56.754
Your necklace is glowing.
Go back to the tree.

17:03.239 --> 17:04.719
It's never done that before.

17:06.982 --> 17:08.418
What do you think it means?

17:38.231 --> 17:39.275
We found it.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.017
The Dream Expanse.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.062
[doors clanging]

17:48.980 --> 17:51.113
Mr. President...

17:51.157 --> 17:55.074
while some feel
Corto Maltese is to blame
for the recent hostilities,

17:55.117 --> 17:59.339
others say it's Kaznia's
economic sanctions
that started the tension.

17:59.382 --> 18:01.297
Will you admit there's
some truth to that?

18:01.341 --> 18:03.386
[in strong accent]
My opinion is not the issue.

18:03.430 --> 18:07.216
What matters is the actions
of the countries involved.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.436
Next question.

18:09.479 --> 18:12.439
-Uh... Okay. I guess--
-Don't let them
duck the question.

18:12.482 --> 18:15.006
Make them confront it.

18:15.050 --> 18:17.357
William is absolutely right.

18:17.400 --> 18:21.578
Especially since
I just arranged for
an off-the-books meeting

18:21.622 --> 18:25.930
between you
and the chief Kaznian
treaty negotiator.

18:25.974 --> 18:28.629
-What?
-His other plans got canceled

18:28.672 --> 18:30.761
because of this
ridiculous dome.

18:30.805 --> 18:33.895
Meeting's at 2:00
this afternoon
at Noonan's on Main.

18:33.938 --> 18:37.638
Yeah, of course.
Yes, I will be there.
Thank you.

18:37.681 --> 18:40.945
-You really are having
a day of days.
-Yeah.

18:40.989 --> 18:43.034
[reporter] The governor
is demanding

18:43.078 --> 18:44.601
Supergirl and
the Super Friends
take down the dome

18:44.645 --> 18:46.647
they've constructed
in National City.

18:46.690 --> 18:49.867
What they did with that dome
was madness.

18:49.911 --> 18:52.957
-What who did?
-The Super Friends.

18:53.001 --> 18:57.266
I know they mean well
and they're dealing with Nyxly
on top of everything else,

18:57.310 --> 19:01.052
but, they did erect a dome
over half the city without
consulting anyone.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.750
But there was no time to.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.839
That creature was going
to destroy a nuclear plant.

19:04.882 --> 19:07.015
Of course.
I'm not arguing that.

19:07.058 --> 19:10.192
But now I'm hearing stories
that employees are being
cut off from work.

19:10.236 --> 19:12.412
Parents separated
from children.

19:12.455 --> 19:14.892
I just hope the Super Friends'
recent success hasn't gone
to their head.

19:14.936 --> 19:18.679
No, it hasn't. It hasn't.
They can handle this.

19:18.722 --> 19:23.074
-Like I can handle you,
President Zakharov.
-[clears throat]

19:25.729 --> 19:29.690
The spires of light represent
the dreams of everyone
on Earth.

19:29.733 --> 19:33.128
But only one houses
the Dream Totem.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.478
The lit path
will lead us there.

19:35.522 --> 19:38.046
Right, where is
this bloody path?

19:38.089 --> 19:40.962
[chuckles] We'll come to it
soon enough.

19:41.005 --> 19:43.530
We've passed
these spires before.
I'm heading back.

19:47.403 --> 19:49.884
-What was that?
-I don't know.

19:49.927 --> 19:53.192
I suppose you could
go investigate
and face a nightmare.

19:53.235 --> 19:55.585
Or you could go back
the way I told you to.

19:55.629 --> 20:00.416
I know trust is hard,
but maybe take a look
around the corner.

20:17.303 --> 20:21.002
-Is that--
-Nia Nal and her sister.

20:21.568 --> 20:23.004
Huh.

20:23.047 --> 20:25.615
Maybe you're
not so bad after all.

20:29.663 --> 20:32.405
Like I said, Governor,
we didn't have
a choice in this.

20:32.448 --> 20:35.234
And like I said,
if you won't take
your dome down,

20:35.277 --> 20:36.800
the National Guard will.

20:36.844 --> 20:38.976
This situation is above
the National Guard, okay?

20:39.020 --> 20:42.806
This creature is
from the Dream Realm.
Bullets can't harm it.

20:42.850 --> 20:46.114
And from what we can tell,
Dream energy is very similar
to nuclear energy.

20:46.157 --> 20:47.811
So if you take that dome down,

20:47.855 --> 20:49.465
it's going to go
straight back for the plant

20:49.509 --> 20:51.685
-making matters even worse.
-Worse?

20:51.728 --> 20:55.254
Than trapping thousands
of citizens in a bubble

20:55.297 --> 20:57.430
with some
other-dimensional terror?

20:57.473 --> 21:02.130
My phone is ringing
off the hook with people
locked indoors,

21:02.173 --> 21:05.786
sheltering in place,
not knowing when they're going
to see their family again.

21:05.829 --> 21:08.092
Governor, I assure you,
we're working on a device

21:08.136 --> 21:10.878
that will allow us to transport
the creature back to
where it came from.

21:10.921 --> 21:11.835
And when will that be ready?

21:14.098 --> 21:16.318
-Twenty-four hours.
-You have 12.

21:16.362 --> 21:18.015
[trilling]

21:18.059 --> 21:21.018
Alex, we're not 12 hours away
from completing this.

21:21.062 --> 21:23.282
-How long then?
-Uncertain.

21:23.325 --> 21:25.980
Restructuring Dream tech
requires massive concentration.

21:26.023 --> 21:28.461
Brainy's just distracted
because there's no word
from Nia yet.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.854
I'm not distracted.
I'm appropriately concerned.

21:32.334 --> 21:33.901
[Lena] Ah!

21:33.944 --> 21:35.119
Brainy...

21:35.163 --> 21:36.251
[alarm blaring]

21:37.557 --> 21:38.993
[J'onn J'onzz]
Is that the creature?

21:39.036 --> 21:43.040
No, that is a mob
trying to escape the dome.

21:43.084 --> 21:45.826
-Supergirl, we have
a situation.
-Where?

21:48.394 --> 21:50.309
[beeping]

21:53.050 --> 21:55.923
I think I've figured
something out.

21:55.966 --> 21:58.229
Do you see these small
diamond shapes here?

21:58.273 --> 22:00.014
[Nia] Little ones
around the big one?

22:00.057 --> 22:03.626
I always assumed
they were decorative,
like a frame.

22:03.670 --> 22:08.501
What if these small diamonds
represent these spires, here?

22:08.544 --> 22:10.590
Guess it's possible.

22:10.633 --> 22:13.810
And if that's true, then maybe
this big diamond
in the center

22:13.854 --> 22:16.509
isn't just a symbol
of the Dream Totem.

22:16.552 --> 22:19.947
It's the actual location.

22:19.990 --> 22:24.386
I know looking
for a giant Dream spire
in the middle of this place

22:24.430 --> 22:27.258
is like looking
for a big tree
in an endless forest.

22:28.434 --> 22:29.739
At least it's something.

22:32.176 --> 22:34.570
Just wish we could get
a better view.

22:34.614 --> 22:36.050
I may have a way.

22:48.584 --> 22:49.455
Wow.

22:58.768 --> 23:01.205
That was amazing.

23:01.249 --> 23:03.686
-Did Mom teach you
how to do this?
-No.

23:03.730 --> 23:06.385
I figured it out by myself.

23:06.428 --> 23:09.866
So, do you see any spires
that look bigger
than the others?

23:09.910 --> 23:10.737
No.

23:14.044 --> 23:15.132
There's one that's more...

23:15.872 --> 23:16.743
gold.

23:22.662 --> 23:25.839
-Maeve, that's it, we found it.
-We did.

23:30.365 --> 23:31.714
We should get moving.

23:36.153 --> 23:38.852
[reporter] Supergirl
calmed rioters
at the dome last night

23:38.895 --> 23:41.463
but tensions are still rising
as people try and get out.

23:41.507 --> 23:43.813
Our government is calling
for people not to intervene,

23:43.857 --> 23:48.035
remain indoors
as our National Guard
averts the crisis.

23:48.078 --> 23:51.342
Hey. What are you doing here?
Your interview's in less
than an hour.

23:51.386 --> 23:54.781
I know. But that riot
broke out last night
because people are furious

23:54.824 --> 23:56.522
at being trapped inside
with the monster.

23:56.565 --> 23:58.828
After I broke it up,
I couldn't not search for it.

23:59.655 --> 24:00.961
And?

24:01.004 --> 24:03.311
[sighs] Still nothing.

24:03.354 --> 24:05.879
Where are Brainy and Lena
with the Dream portal?

24:05.922 --> 24:07.533
Well, they figured out
the interface,

24:07.576 --> 24:09.360
and they think activating it

24:09.404 --> 24:11.275
might function like a beacon
drawing the creature to it.

24:11.319 --> 24:14.191
The question is,
will they be done before
the Guard moves in?

24:14.235 --> 24:16.498
Did Governor Pena say
if she would grant
an extension?

24:16.542 --> 24:17.978
I haven't heard
anything back yet.

24:18.021 --> 24:19.153
[cell phone buzzing]

24:20.415 --> 24:22.809
It's Andrea.

24:22.852 --> 24:25.246
Kara, you didn't
show up for the meeting
I arranged yesterday.

24:26.160 --> 24:28.815
I know. I know, I, uh...

24:28.858 --> 24:32.296
Something came up
and I had to cancel,
but I let the negotiator know.

24:32.340 --> 24:35.517
No, no, I don't wanna
hear excuses.

24:35.561 --> 24:39.303
Kara, you're one of the most
talented reporters
I have ever seen.

24:39.347 --> 24:40.609
So often I give you leeway.

24:41.523 --> 24:43.351
I don't ask where you go

24:43.394 --> 24:45.788
when you leave the office
in the middle of the day.

24:45.832 --> 24:48.791
I don't get upset
when you disappear
for weeks on end

24:48.835 --> 24:50.967
saying you're working
on a huge story
with Cat Grant

24:51.011 --> 24:53.535
only to return empty-handed.

24:53.579 --> 24:57.844
Because your work
is usually flawless.

24:57.887 --> 25:03.763
But lately, Kara,
you're not here
and it's beginning to show.

25:03.806 --> 25:06.417
You told me that an interview
showing these two leaders

25:06.461 --> 25:10.378
coming together peacefully
could inspire the world.

25:10.421 --> 25:14.077
-It... It can. It will.
-Then start acting like it.

25:15.992 --> 25:18.081
I'll see you
at the Civic Center
in 30 minutes.

25:19.082 --> 25:20.170
Don't be late.

25:20.214 --> 25:21.781
[line beeps]

25:21.824 --> 25:23.870
[Alex] Hey. What's going on?

25:23.913 --> 25:25.480
Is everything okay
with the interview?

25:26.350 --> 25:27.569
Uh...

25:28.222 --> 25:29.484
I just...

25:29.528 --> 25:30.572
Um...

25:30.616 --> 25:31.442
It will be.

25:32.487 --> 25:34.794
I just feel like...

25:34.837 --> 25:36.926
ever since I got back
from the Phantom Zone,

25:36.970 --> 25:39.146
ever since Nyxly arrived,

25:39.189 --> 25:43.019
I feel like I have been
one step behind on everything.

25:43.063 --> 25:46.762
And the stakes are so high,
like, if we make
one wrong move,

25:46.806 --> 25:48.851
it could mean literally
the end of everything.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.940
We are not going
to let that happen.

25:50.984 --> 25:53.943
We just have to take things
one step at a time.

25:53.987 --> 25:57.164
And step one
is you need to get
your butt to that interview.

25:57.207 --> 25:59.035
We will take care
of the nightmare creature.

25:59.079 --> 26:03.039
And step two, we need
to take this freaking imp down.

26:09.002 --> 26:10.699
[J'onn J'onzz] Governor,
you're making a big mistake.

26:10.743 --> 26:12.614
If you breach the dome,
the creature might run.

26:12.658 --> 26:14.181
And then we may never find it

26:14.224 --> 26:16.575
until it does who knows
what sort of damage.

26:16.618 --> 26:19.012
We are on the verge
of being able to send it back.

26:19.752 --> 26:20.753
Governor?

26:22.363 --> 26:24.234
What's up?

26:24.278 --> 26:26.933
Apparently, the governor
has been liaising
with the Air Force.

26:26.976 --> 26:28.935
In one hour,
the Luthor Corp satellites

26:28.978 --> 26:30.980
that have been
sustaining the dome
will be shut down.

26:31.024 --> 26:33.809
A group of National Guardsmen
will be charging in.

26:33.853 --> 26:35.898
Okay, well, one hour
is within the time frame

26:35.942 --> 26:37.857
that Lena said
she and Brainy would be done.

26:37.900 --> 26:39.728
-So we can still do this?
-Yeah.

26:39.772 --> 26:43.079
But first, I think
you need to do something.

26:43.123 --> 26:45.038
William, what are you
doing here?

26:45.081 --> 26:47.083
My contact at the Capitol
told me about
the governor's plan

26:47.127 --> 26:49.303
so I thought I'd come here
to get a statement
that might help

26:49.346 --> 26:50.347
bring down the heat.

26:51.697 --> 26:52.698
The governor is scared.

26:53.829 --> 26:55.788
The people are scared.

26:55.831 --> 26:58.312
In the past few weeks,
this city has seen
buildings explode,

26:58.355 --> 27:00.227
giant cats, mass riots...

27:00.270 --> 27:04.710
And now a dome, with Nyxly
and a nightmare monster.

27:06.668 --> 27:11.020
What everyone needs
is to hear a calm
and clear voice.

27:14.023 --> 27:15.546
William.

27:15.590 --> 27:17.113
J'onn and I are more than happy
to make a--

27:17.157 --> 27:19.159
Supergirl was there
when the dome went up.

27:19.202 --> 27:22.205
The people need to hear
from the Girl of Steel herself.

27:22.249 --> 27:25.208
[hesitating] I don't have time
to make comments. I'm sorry.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.172
This is it.

27:32.215 --> 27:36.045
-The Dream Totem
should be in this spire.
-Maeve, wait.

27:36.089 --> 27:39.701
If the Oracle put the Totem
in this spire for protection,

27:39.745 --> 27:41.050
we need to be ready
for anything.

27:42.356 --> 27:43.400
So what do we do?

27:53.323 --> 27:54.585
Let me take the lead.

28:05.596 --> 28:06.685
There it is.

28:07.598 --> 28:08.556
The Dream Totem.

28:10.123 --> 28:13.213
I'll grab it, then we can
get out of here.

28:15.650 --> 28:16.651
Maeve?

28:17.260 --> 28:18.522
[yelps]

28:18.566 --> 28:20.699
[Oracle] You're not pure,
Maeve Nal.

28:20.742 --> 28:24.615
You're a traitor to your blood,
to try to take her power
for your own.

28:27.444 --> 28:29.098
It was supposed to be mine.

28:31.318 --> 28:35.496
I worked my entire life
towards becoming the Dreamer.

28:35.539 --> 28:40.457
Studying, preparing...
Every decision I ever made
was for that.

28:41.850 --> 28:44.505
It was my purpose, my identity.

28:46.028 --> 28:50.641
-And you took it.
-I didn't have a choice.

28:50.685 --> 28:53.079
I tried to transfer
the powers to you,
I told you that.

28:53.122 --> 28:54.210
But I couldn't.

28:54.254 --> 28:55.646
So what do you want me to say?

28:56.909 --> 28:57.997
That...

28:58.040 --> 28:59.694
That you should be the Dreamer?

28:59.738 --> 29:01.348
That I don't know
what I'm doing
most of the time?

29:01.391 --> 29:02.784
That I'm in over my head?

29:02.828 --> 29:05.265
-Honesty, finally.
-Oh, you want honesty?

29:06.266 --> 29:07.267
Okay.

29:08.485 --> 29:12.794
I have no pity for you!

29:12.838 --> 29:15.623
I'm sorry that you wasted
all of those years

29:15.666 --> 29:17.625
reading all of those books,

29:17.668 --> 29:20.846
assuming with no cause,
by the way, that you'd be
the Dreamer.

29:20.889 --> 29:23.457
But look at yourself, Maeve.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.460
You were willing to put
the entire universe at stake

29:26.503 --> 29:28.810
so you could take the powers.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.681
Are you really that selfish?

29:32.248 --> 29:35.295
Do you think that's what
the Dreamer would do?

29:35.338 --> 29:37.471
You don't think I deserve
these powers?

29:37.514 --> 29:38.820
You don't think
I'm a real woman?

29:38.864 --> 29:40.691
Well, I don't care.

29:42.868 --> 29:44.565
I know who I am.

29:46.654 --> 29:47.698
I am the Dreamer.

29:49.091 --> 29:50.832
The question is who are you?

29:52.921 --> 29:55.663
Because you are clearly
not the sister that
I thought you were.

29:57.534 --> 30:00.189
Am I interrupting
a family fight or something?

30:01.712 --> 30:02.844
I'll make this quick, then.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.331
No!

30:13.159 --> 30:15.335
Wow, nice move.
Who taught you that one?
Your mama, or your sister?

30:16.249 --> 30:17.250
No!

30:19.600 --> 30:22.777
Well done.
Now take the Totem.

30:22.821 --> 30:26.085
Aren't I supposed to be pure
of heart and mind,
or some such?

30:26.128 --> 30:28.261
That's to get past
the Oracle's ward.

30:28.304 --> 30:32.700
If, however,
the Oracle is no more,
we can be just us girls.

30:32.743 --> 30:33.788
[giggles]

30:40.577 --> 30:42.884
That thing is breaking down
the Oracle's ward.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.712
If it does,
she can take the Totem.

30:53.939 --> 30:56.028
I'll tell Supergirl
you died nobly.

30:57.507 --> 30:59.161
Mom said it could
light up my dreams.

30:59.205 --> 31:00.946
Maybe it can give you
the extra power you need.

31:05.124 --> 31:06.603
[laughs menacingly]

31:08.649 --> 31:10.956
This is for using me.

31:14.350 --> 31:17.571
And this is for hurting
my friends.

31:22.054 --> 31:23.272
[screams]

31:25.971 --> 31:28.277
Princess, we can't win this.

31:28.321 --> 31:29.626
I guess it's time to go then.

31:36.459 --> 31:37.460
[clears throat]

31:41.551 --> 31:43.945
Miss Danvers?
Miss Rojas wanted me
to let you know that

31:43.989 --> 31:46.165
the prime minister
and the president
are running late.

31:46.208 --> 31:49.124
-Oh, okay, no worries.
Thank you.
-Thanks.

31:51.910 --> 31:53.476
[mutters indistinctly]

31:57.916 --> 32:00.135
-Alex, any update?
-All good.

32:00.179 --> 32:02.921
We will have the portal
powered up at the northernmost
point of the dome.

32:02.964 --> 32:05.010
As soon as it's up,
it should draw the monster here

32:05.053 --> 32:07.099
and then we'll get it home
before the dome goes down.

32:07.142 --> 32:11.277
Well, that's a problem
because the dome
is coming down now.

32:11.320 --> 32:13.322
Hey, don't worry. We got this.

32:16.412 --> 32:17.979
Not without me. I'm coming.

32:19.894 --> 32:22.201
Now that the portal's up,
the monster should
be drawn here.

32:22.244 --> 32:24.159
[Alex] You see anything
up there, J'onn?

32:24.203 --> 32:26.988
No trace of the monster,
but the National Guard
is on its way.

32:28.337 --> 32:29.512
Any sign?

32:31.427 --> 32:33.168
[rumbling]

32:33.212 --> 32:34.996
I believe that is the creature.

32:44.919 --> 32:45.920
[J'onn J'onzz] It's working.

32:51.882 --> 32:54.059
No!

32:54.102 --> 32:56.887
Stop this now!
You're drawing him away
from where it needs to go.

33:07.898 --> 33:09.726
-The columns.
-Yeah, I've got it.

33:12.338 --> 33:15.297
I'm getting
the portal back online.
It's now or never.

33:16.907 --> 33:17.908
Now!

33:27.092 --> 33:28.876
You did it.

33:28.919 --> 33:30.399
[J'onn J'onzz] I'll go talk
to the National Guard.

33:31.226 --> 33:32.793
Oh, no, I gotta go.

33:32.836 --> 33:34.751
-The interview.
-We'll talk to the governor.

33:43.760 --> 33:46.894
What happened?
I thought you said
they were late.

33:46.937 --> 33:49.897
Not that late.
When they couldn't
find you, they left.

33:49.940 --> 33:51.507
Miss Rojas said
she tried calling you.

33:56.773 --> 33:58.166
[buzzing]

33:59.776 --> 34:01.300
-Brainy?
-Supergirl.

34:01.996 --> 34:04.042
Nia just called.

34:04.085 --> 34:06.566
Her and her sister made it out
of the Dream Realm
in one piece.

34:06.609 --> 34:08.611
But Nyxly got away
with the Dream Totem.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.113
I messed up, William.

34:33.636 --> 34:35.682
Big time.

34:35.725 --> 34:39.033
Having a dome
over half the city has
a way of disrupting plans.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.383
What can you do?

34:41.427 --> 34:45.518
I just feel like there's
never enough time in a day
to get everything done.

34:45.561 --> 34:47.737
And then when I am able
to check everything off,

34:47.781 --> 34:51.437
I still... I wake up
the next day and realize
there's more to do.

34:53.047 --> 34:54.657
It just never ends and...

34:56.659 --> 34:58.531
I'm drowning.

35:00.707 --> 35:03.144
And I'm worried
I'm bringing everyone
around me down.

35:03.188 --> 35:04.493
No.

35:04.537 --> 35:07.366
Today was a bad day.

35:07.409 --> 35:09.498
But you are allowed
those once in a while.

35:10.717 --> 35:11.848
I don't know that I am.

35:15.200 --> 35:19.160
May I remind you
of something you told me
Cat Grant once said?

35:21.641 --> 35:23.947
"You can have it all.

35:23.991 --> 35:25.732
You just can't have it all
at the same time."

35:27.429 --> 35:30.998
So maybe ask yourself...

35:31.041 --> 35:34.044
What does Kara Danvers
want right now?

35:36.003 --> 35:37.483
When you figure that out,

35:37.526 --> 35:40.703
all you need to do is not stop
until you get it.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.055
Andrea?

35:46.709 --> 35:48.189
I'm so sorry.

35:48.233 --> 35:50.060
Your contrition
isn't important right now.

35:50.104 --> 35:53.194
What is important
is that I was able
to salvage your faux pas

35:53.238 --> 35:56.676
and convince President Zakharov
and Prime Minister Perez

35:56.719 --> 35:59.331
to extend their trip by a day.

35:59.374 --> 36:02.856
Tomorrow, 12:30
at the Civic Center.

36:03.726 --> 36:04.771
Do not be late.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.994
William should
do the interview.

36:11.038 --> 36:12.735
-What?
-I've given him
my interview packet.

36:12.779 --> 36:14.955
He has background
on both leaders

36:14.998 --> 36:17.436
plus the deal points
of the peace treaty.

36:17.479 --> 36:21.179
I've delegated
all my other articles
to Franklin and Mackenzie.

36:21.222 --> 36:24.573
-Kara, what are
you talking about?
-You were right, Andrea.

36:25.705 --> 36:26.923
I'm not here.

36:27.707 --> 36:28.577
Not fully.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.886
And there's too much at stake
for that right now.

36:33.756 --> 36:34.583
So, uh...

36:36.281 --> 36:37.107
I quit.

36:40.850 --> 36:41.764
[sighs]

36:51.905 --> 36:56.257
William, I should have
taken you up on your offer
to talk directly to the people.

36:56.301 --> 36:57.824
Maybe it's not too late
to fix that.

36:59.129 --> 37:00.130
Will you help me?

37:09.879 --> 37:10.924
Nia?

37:12.926 --> 37:14.406
You have to understand.

37:17.626 --> 37:20.499
I was so wrapped up
in my own pain.

37:22.327 --> 37:27.288
I never even thought about you
or our family or...

37:27.332 --> 37:31.161
the ramifications
my words could have
on any of us.

37:34.948 --> 37:37.429
And I'm sorry.

37:37.472 --> 37:40.954
I'm sorry for trying
to steal the Totem.

37:41.998 --> 37:43.565
For abandoning you.

37:47.352 --> 37:49.963
I never thought you weren't
a real woman.

37:52.792 --> 37:53.749
I just...

37:55.621 --> 37:58.537
I wanted you to be
in as much pain as I was.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.016
But seeing you today,

38:01.366 --> 38:04.630
your abilities,
your selflessness.

38:08.547 --> 38:09.765
You are the Dreamer.

38:11.245 --> 38:13.508
You always have been.

38:15.597 --> 38:16.903
Forgive me?

38:18.208 --> 38:20.994
No.

38:21.037 --> 38:25.085
Maeve, you may
have spent your life
studying to be the Dreamer,

38:25.128 --> 38:28.262
but I spent mine trying
to make you happy.

38:29.872 --> 38:31.221
You were my best friend.

38:34.703 --> 38:37.315
And you tore me down
like it was nothing.

38:37.358 --> 38:39.534
Then you ran away.

38:39.578 --> 38:43.364
You changed your name.
You pretended like
nothing ever happened.

38:43.408 --> 38:45.540
You can't erase
what you did, Maeve.

38:45.584 --> 38:50.545
Because of your actions,
we both had to grieve
Mom alone.

38:50.589 --> 38:54.419
And I had to learn these powers
that I didn't ask for alone.

38:54.462 --> 38:55.681
I needed you!

38:59.162 --> 39:00.642
I needed my big sister.

39:03.253 --> 39:06.387
If it wasn't for Kara
and Brainy, I would have
been completely lost.

39:08.258 --> 39:10.260
So, no, I can't forgive you.

39:13.655 --> 39:16.092
But I can offer you
a second chance.

39:18.268 --> 39:20.793
A final chance...

39:24.579 --> 39:25.885
for us to be sisters again.

39:29.454 --> 39:30.411
Thank you.

39:37.679 --> 39:40.203
Hey, you should have this.

39:45.121 --> 39:47.559
-And you should
probably call Dad.
-[laughs]

39:48.995 --> 39:50.300
He misses you.

39:54.957 --> 39:57.133
Brainy and I
re-fortified the hiding place

39:57.177 --> 40:00.528
for the Courage
and Humanity Totem using
Coluan science and Earth magic.

40:00.572 --> 40:04.097
So even with the Dream Totem,
she won't be able to create
the AllStone.

40:04.140 --> 40:06.273
Well, that's good.
That helps on one battlefront.

40:06.316 --> 40:09.450
Now, if we could
just do something
about the negative press.

40:09.494 --> 40:11.147
[speaking indistinctly]

40:11.191 --> 40:13.062
People just disagree
with us sometimes.

40:13.106 --> 40:14.934
Well, this is true,

40:14.977 --> 40:16.457
but if we're going to take on
a threat as powerful as Nyxly,

40:16.501 --> 40:18.938
we're going to need
the public on our side.

40:18.981 --> 40:21.331
Speaking of.

40:21.375 --> 40:24.900
Citizens of National City,
I come to you tonight
with an apology.

40:24.944 --> 40:27.642
I know you have always placed
your hope and trust in me.

40:27.686 --> 40:32.125
But now, as we face the alien
you know as Nyxly,

40:32.168 --> 40:34.867
I fear I haven't always
been able to deliver.

40:34.910 --> 40:36.390
And for that, I am sorry.

40:37.522 --> 40:39.306
But I give you my word...

40:40.525 --> 40:42.570
Nyxly will be stopped.

40:42.614 --> 40:44.616
No matter the cost.

40:44.659 --> 40:49.534
Because for me and my friends,
failure is not an option.

41:01.284 --> 41:03.765
If only I had my bloody magic.

41:03.809 --> 41:08.640
[labored] Before it's too late,
please give me the Totem.

41:08.683 --> 41:10.119
Why?

41:10.163 --> 41:12.644
[distorted] To guarantee
your... future.

41:12.687 --> 41:15.385
There's one last thing
for me to... To do.

41:20.913 --> 41:22.828
[dramatic music playing]

41:36.624 --> 41:37.495
What are you?

41:40.454 --> 41:42.108
The key to your success.

41:48.636 --> 41:50.246
[theme music playing]
