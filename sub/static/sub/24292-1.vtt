to me about stock prices?

29:03.242 --> 29:05.274
The shareholders won't be happy.

29:05.275 --> 29:07.944
It's not our job to make them happy.
It's our job to make them money,

29:13.317 --> 29:16.517

29:16.520 --> 29:18.420
This is the first of
our planned upgrades.

Halliday's ad restrictions,

And so here it is.

Of course I am.

54:39.175 --> 54:41.805
Because the first
thing that I would do

54:41.810 --> 54:45.547
is convert all the schools
on Ludus to replicas

54:45.548 --> 54:48.716

and Ferris Bueller.

54:48.717 --> 54:51.886
No way. That's a great idea.

54:51.887 --> 54:54.355
Which school,
Ridgemont or Faber?

54:54.356 --> 54:57.456
Fast Times at Ridgemont
High, not John Hughes.

54:57.459 --> 55:00.695
It's a trap. Faber College
from Animal House.

55:00.696 --> 55:02.326

55:02.331 --> 55:05.331

High or Animal House.

55:05.334 --> 55:08.673

they went to Shermer High School,

which is in Shermer, Illinois.

02:06:06.591 --> 02:06:08.291
They want your signature, Wade.

02:06:16.167 --> 02:06:18.435
I'm splitting it with my clan.

02:06:18.436 --> 02:06:20.306
We're gonna run things together.

02:06:24.776 --> 02:06:26.976
That's a good choice.

02:06:26.978 --> 02:06:29.048
<font color="#ff00ff">(CROWD CHEERING)</font>

02:06:54.772 --> 02:06:58.375
F'Nale, listen to
me very carefully.

02:06:58.376 --> 02:06:59.536
<font color="#ff00ff">(NOLAN GROANS)</font>

02:07:07.018 --> 02:07:09.948
Mr. Morrow... I mean, Og,

02:07:09.954 --> 02:07:11.460
how'd you get here so fast?

02:07:11.461 --> 02:07:14.156
I flew from the stars
on my magic sleigh.

02:07:14.158 --> 02:07:16.727
<font color="#ff00ff">(CHUCKLES)</font> Everyone's
been watching.

02:07:16.728 --> 02:07:20.028
Of course, I've been watching
a little closer than most.

02:07:24.002 --> 02:07:25.902
You?

02:07:25.904 --> 02:07:27.214
You're the Curator?

02:07:30.875 --> 02:07:34.344
<font color="#ff00ff">(IN BRITISH ACCENT)</font>
Well played, Parzival.

02:07:34.345 --> 02:07:36.375
<font color="#ff00ff">(IN NORMAL VOICE)</font> Jim told me
nothing about the contest,

02:07:36.381 --> 02:07:39.750
so there was no rule about me
losing a bet to a smart kid.

02:07:39.751 --> 02:07:42.386
Not that you needed my help.

02:07:42.387 --> 02:07:46.717
You figured out that Kira
was the key on your own.

02:07:46.724 --> 02:07:49.434
Yeah, but... Kira
wasn't the key.

02:07:50.695 --> 02:07:52.625
It was you, Mr. Morrow.

02:07:54.699 --> 02:07:56.529
You were the Rosebud.

02:07:56.534 --> 02:07:58.804
And Halliday's
biggest regret was

02:08:00.438 --> 02:08:02.108
losing his only friend.

02:08:04.909 --> 02:08:06.276
<font color="#ff00ff">(CLEARS THROAT)</font>

02:08:06.277 --> 02:08:08.607
You know, Jim used
to say the OASIS

02:08:08.613 --> 02:08:11.153
was never supposed to
be a one-player game.

02:08:14.786 --> 02:08:17.586
Now, who do we have here?

02:08:17.589 --> 02:08:20.257
Oh. Well, look who it is.

02:08:20.258 --> 02:08:22.027
It's my heroes, the High Five.

02:08:22.028 --> 02:08:23.696
You must be Art3mis. Samantha.

02:08:23.697 --> 02:08:25.625
<font color="#ff8000">WADE</font>: The High Five
took over the OASIS,

02:08:25.630 --> 02:08:27.530
and the first thing we did

02:08:27.532 --> 02:08:30.772
was sign Ogden Morrow to a
non-exclusive consultancy.

02:08:30.773 --> 02:08:33.768
The salary, per his demand,

02:08:33.771 --> 02:08:37.040
was 25 cents. One quarter.

02:08:37.041 --> 02:08:38.311
<font color="#ff00ff">(COIN CLINKS)</font>

02:08:40.244 --> 02:08:42.654
With his guidance, our
second move was to ban

02:08:42.655 --> 02:08:46.116
any loyalty centers from
accessing the OASIS.

02:08:46.117 --> 02:08:49.617
IOI had no choice. They
shut 'em all down.

02:08:52.323 --> 02:08:55.325
The third thing we did
wasn't as popular.

02:08:55.326 --> 02:08:59.326
We closed the OASIS on
Tuesdays and Thursdays.

02:08:59.330 --> 02:09:01.830
I know, it sounds
like a weird move,

02:09:01.833 --> 02:09:04.803
but people need to spend
more time in the real world.

02:09:06.404 --> 02:09:09.473
'Cause, like Halliday said,

02:09:09.474 --> 02:09:13.884
reality is the only
thing that's real.
