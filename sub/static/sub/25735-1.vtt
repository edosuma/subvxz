03:33.129 --> 03:34.128
People are dying in the

03:34.130 --> 03:35.630
streets by the thousands.

03:35.632 --> 03:37.674
The police are trying
to form a defensive zone

03:37.676 --> 03:38.800
but I don't know if
they're gonna be

03:38.802 --> 03:41.010
able to stop those things.

03:41.012 --> 03:43.388
They're closing the freeways
and there is no way to get out...

03:43.390 --> 03:44.722
Frightened people
are pouring into the

03:44.724 --> 03:46.683
hospitals by the thousands.

03:46.685 --> 03:48.851
Doctors say that almost all
wounds show immediate infection.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.561
Time before final transformation

03:50.563 --> 03:52.647
depends on the size
of the wound...

03:52.649 --> 03:54.734
Ladies and gentlemen this
will be our last transmission.

03:56.111 --> 03:58.196
The dead are rising.

04:00.073 --> 04:03.116
The few cities that have
managed to keep the

04:03.118 --> 04:06.077
epidemic at bay have fallen.

04:06.079 --> 04:09.249
Montreal is the last city in
the country still standing.

04:13.503 --> 04:17.046
Reports of sporadic
violence and madness

04:17.048 --> 04:22.385
indicate that this will
soon come to an end.

04:22.387 --> 04:26.889
The Public Safety Authority has
organized a mass evacuation

04:26.891 --> 04:29.892
from the last exit point

04:29.894 --> 04:33.815
of the city, Parc Jean-Drapeau,
on October 25th 2014.

04:35.525 --> 04:39.527
There will be five and 10
kilometer paths available.

04:39.529 --> 04:46.828
You can register at
www.courirmontreal.com.

04:49.247 --> 04:53.501
What ever these things are you
can not let them get to you.

04:55.420 --> 04:59.382
Running is the key to your
survival, be prepared to run.

05:00.759 --> 05:04.218
Good luck.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.932
Hey, come on, come

13:29.934 --> 13:31.768
Come and fucking get

13:57.379 --> 13:58.920
Come on you.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.528
Come on.

19:56.613 --> 19:59.614
I know you're in there, come on.

19:59.616 --> 20:02.617
Hey, get out here come on.

22:48.410 --> 22:49.951
Go.

22:49.953 --> 22:50.954
Check it's pack.

22:55.417 --> 22:56.668
- He's got food.
- Take it.

23:02.382 --> 23:04.966
Come on there'll be
more coming soon.

23:12.851 --> 23:13.975
Go go go.

25:08.049 --> 25:10.051
Fine, fine, I
know, I'll do it.

25:30.989 --> 25:32.532
Hello Alan.

25:37.454 --> 25:39.829
You aren't still mad about
the other day are you?

26:14.949 --> 26:17.202
Howdy Wendy,
nice day isn't it?

26:22.582 --> 26:24.582
Don't you wish it would
just stay like this forever?

26:40.975 --> 26:42.892
Careful what
you wish for Alan.

27:06.835 --> 27:09.379
Sorry about that
Mrs. Carruthers.

27:10.588 --> 27:13.091
I know, I know,
just a little water.

27:13.758 --> 27:15.260
You're getting a little dry.

27:19.222 --> 27:21.472
I don't care if it's
the king of England.

27:21.474 --> 27:24.144
He has to pay a good faith
deposit, same as everyone else.

27:26.062 --> 27:28.271
Tell him if he doesn't
pay in seven days

27:28.273 --> 27:30.191
the deal is off, it's
as simple as that.

27:30.608 --> 27:32.902
I don't wait around for anyone.

27:46.583 --> 27:48.875
How's this Mrs. Carruthers,

27:48.877 --> 27:50.960
I'll look in the Nelson house
and see if there's any makeup.

27:50.962 --> 27:52.420
It's really no problem.

28:28.333 --> 28:29.791
Who's taking who on
a walk this afternoon?

28:29.793 --> 28:31.459
You're telling me?

28:31.461 --> 28:33.505
She never wants to sit
still for a second.

28:34.589 --> 28:37.465
Holly, come on inside and
wash up for dinner you hear?

28:37.467 --> 28:39.258
Not yet, just a
few more minutes.

28:39.260 --> 28:42.970
You too sexy angel lady.

28:42.972 --> 28:45.848
Looks like my better
half is calling.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.517
You two stay out of trouble.

28:47.519 --> 28:49.435
Come on girl, Daddy
has a new bottle

28:49.437 --> 28:50.855
of wine he wants to break in.

28:51.314 --> 28:52.816
Afternoon Rhonda.

28:58.405 --> 29:01.197
Time's up little lady.

29:01.199 --> 29:03.533
Hey Missy, you keep
making your face like that

29:03.535 --> 29:05.370
it's gonna freeze, come on.

29:36.317 --> 29:39.235
I'm sorry you know the rules.

29:39.237 --> 29:41.239
I can only take care of the
ones on this side of the tape.

29:41.990 --> 29:43.825
If I help you I
gotta help everybody,

29:45.035 --> 29:46.659
then I would never
see my neighbors,

29:46.661 --> 29:48.204
then I would never see...

29:53.710 --> 29:56.546
I have to stop somewhere,
you know the rules.

30:02.427 --> 30:04.761
Bitch, you better
get back to him,

30:04.763 --> 30:06.637
isn't what all this is about,

30:06.639 --> 30:08.097
all this trekking
about with your bucket?

30:32.791 --> 30:34.459
Hi.

30:37.462 --> 30:38.838
I'm wearing your shirt.

30:42.092 --> 30:43.424
You remember how I told
you to throw it out

30:43.426 --> 30:45.093
'cause it was too sweaty?

30:53.353 --> 30:55.478
You never did.

31:05.407 --> 31:07.826
I used to hate
this shirt so much,

31:09.619 --> 31:11.369
and now...

31:14.749 --> 31:16.668
How much longer,

31:19.170 --> 31:21.006
tell me will you?

31:25.385 --> 31:27.510
- Come on.
- Slow down.

31:27.512 --> 31:30.388
Come on.
Hey, Wendy no peeking.

31:30.390 --> 31:32.056
Come on this isn't
funny, what is it, come on.

31:32.058 --> 31:36.062
- Right here, ready?
- I'm ready.

31:38.857 --> 31:40.525
Wendy Pickett...

32:30.909 --> 32:32.742
Hey babe just sending
you a quick message here

32:32.744 --> 32:33.703
before I leave for the airport.

32:35.080 --> 32:38.247
I miss you and I
will see you soon

32:38.249 --> 32:41.876
and I just wanted you
to know that I am sorry

32:41.878 --> 32:45.046
for having to travel all
the time and not be home

32:45.048 --> 32:49.717
and I know I know, but I
just wanted you to know

32:49.719 --> 32:53.638
that when I get back I won't
be leaving you for a long time.

32:53.640 --> 32:56.641
Anyway, I love
you babe, I'll see you soon.

33:15.578 --> 33:17.080
Wendy.

33:18.331 --> 33:20.083
Wendy.

33:25.380 --> 33:27.382
Let me in sweetie.

33:28.842 --> 33:30.967
Jason?

33:30.969 --> 33:32.095
I'm hungry Wendy.

33:34.347 --> 33:36.431
I need sustenance.

33:36.433 --> 33:37.890
What do you want babe?

33:37.892 --> 33:38.727
I'll get you anything.

33:40.562 --> 33:42.562
I want to eat.

33:42.564 --> 33:44.981
What do you want to eat?

33:44.983 --> 33:48.653
I want to eat your skinny legs.

34:35.158 --> 34:36.326
I'm going.

35:41.558 --> 35:44.058
No, no.

35:44.060 --> 35:45.770
No no no.

35:47.355 --> 35:50.440
No, no, no.

36:42.077 --> 36:42.952
Wait.

36:44.954 --> 36:45.789
I'm coming.

36:46.289 --> 36:49.040
The president is coming.

36:49.042 --> 36:52.170
Fuck! the annual results report!

36:52.962 --> 36:54.589
No no no no.

36:55.757 --> 36:56.633
I don't have it.

36:57.092 --> 36:57.926
The data.

36:58.802 --> 37:00.343
We have no time.

37:00.345 --> 37:01.594
What can we do now?

37:01.596 --> 37:02.931
He is arriving!

37:06.851 --> 37:07.686
Let's play dead!

37:28.456 --> 37:29.332
Oh shit!

37:30.583 --> 37:31.459
Everyone is dead.

37:36.131 --> 37:38.675
And now who is going
to get the pay raise?

38:03.700 --> 38:05.992
Out! Out!

38:05.994 --> 38:08.786
I have an open ended contract!

38:16.296 --> 38:17.839
It's temporary!

38:30.560 --> 38:31.934
Matesanz!

38:31.936 --> 38:32.977
Matesanz, are you there?

38:32.979 --> 38:34.812
Open for Dos Equis!

38:34.814 --> 38:36.230
How can I know you
are not one of them?

38:36.232 --> 38:38.441
Oh god! Matesanz! Open the door.

38:38.443 --> 38:39.444
They are coming!

38:46.034 --> 38:47.452
What is your opinion about
the flexibility of labour?

38:49.454 --> 38:51.956
Is a progress and has gotten
no jobs destruction.

38:55.043 --> 38:58.586
Fuck!
Matesanz, What is happening?

38:58.588 --> 38:59.881
I don't know
I think, they have rebelled.

39:03.134 --> 39:05.468
The table!
The table!

39:05.470 --> 39:07.095
Come on! come on!
Help me!

39:07.097 --> 39:08.056
What are you waiting for?

39:10.392 --> 39:11.724
What do you know?
How many are left?

39:11.726 --> 39:13.226
- Any director?
- No.

39:13.228 --> 39:14.143
- Chief executives?
- No.

39:14.145 --> 39:15.478
- Vice president?
- No

39:15.480 --> 39:17.855
- Deputy directors?
- No, Mr. There is nobody left!

39:17.857 --> 39:18.858
Oh! Shit!

39:20.068 --> 39:21.027
It seems that is contagious.

39:24.030 --> 39:25.824
Contagious? What do you mean?

39:32.080 --> 39:33.998
Yes sir.

39:34.874 --> 39:35.750
Around 30 min ago,

39:37.002 --> 39:38.501
I opened the door to Pelaez.

39:38.503 --> 39:39.337
He looked very bad.

39:40.588 --> 39:41.546
He told me that they
surrounded him near

39:41.548 --> 39:42.922
to the vending machines.

39:42.924 --> 39:47.218
When he arrived,
he was sweating; nervous.

39:47.220 --> 39:49.887
He began to claim a
collective agreement.

39:49.889 --> 39:51.973
Register the scholars
in social security.

39:51.975 --> 39:53.266
Stop the salary decreases.

39:53.268 --> 39:55.103
Holy God!

39:55.562 --> 39:57.478
What did you do?

39:57.480 --> 39:59.399
Before it was worse,
I put it in quarantine.

40:01.776 --> 40:03.153
I want to see it. Where is he?

40:04.112 --> 40:05.071
There.

40:19.794 --> 40:20.670
Poor Pelaez, we lost him.

40:22.797 --> 40:23.631
We can't do nothing for him.

40:26.843 --> 40:29.552
We need to go, to
Human Resources.

40:32.932 --> 40:35.433
We can advance through
the air-conditioning

40:35.435 --> 40:38.061
ducts to reach the office.

40:38.063 --> 40:40.398
There is all the documentation.
We need to find a way out.

40:43.026 --> 40:45.109
Fuck Matesanz.
So hot in here!

40:45.111 --> 40:48.237
Is this not supposed to be
the air conditioner tubes?

40:48.239 --> 40:50.698
Sir, it's because you, in the last
shareholders meeting,

40:50.700 --> 40:51.868
- decided to suppress the air conditioner.
- Silence! Look!

41:10.303 --> 41:13.181
Let's go Matesanz,
we have no time to waste.

41:23.316 --> 41:24.317
Here they are.

41:42.210 --> 41:43.668
Ok, Matesanz.

41:43.670 --> 41:44.504
Ready!

41:46.006 --> 41:47.924
You start to preparing the
dismissal letters.

41:49.801 --> 41:52.051
I'm signing it.

41:55.056 --> 41:59.183
Free dismissal!!!

42:02.272 --> 42:03.855
World Health
Organization today raised

42:03.857 --> 42:06.607
it's alert to the
highest possible level.

42:06.609 --> 42:08.109
Doctors and
emergency rooms

42:08.111 --> 42:09.610
across the country are getting ready

42:09.612 --> 42:11.404
for the increased number of people

42:11.406 --> 42:12.780
who may become
infected with the vi...

42:18.204 --> 42:21.414
The burial grounds
were used by organized

42:21.416 --> 42:25.251
crime at first, to hide
away their victims.

42:25.253 --> 42:28.838
And soon after became industrial
zones, were factories

42:28.840 --> 42:31.549
started to spill their
waste on this grounds.

42:31.551 --> 42:37.347
They started to exhume this
corpses and in a few hours.

42:37.349 --> 42:41.559
The corpses, they started
to wake up; to reanimate.

42:41.561 --> 42:44.604
People out of the burial
grounds or exhumed

42:44.606 --> 42:47.648
corpses started to stand
up and started to-

42:47.650 --> 42:50.151
- Homicides have
doubled in Tijuana-

42:50.153 --> 42:51.861
- A person that came
back from the dead.

42:51.863 --> 42:53.907
Infecting other people.

42:55.867 --> 42:58.868
Its effects takes
away flesh in pieces-

42:58.870 --> 43:00.997
They live only by instinct,
a survival instinct.

43:02.499 --> 43:06.793
In an ongoing search for food.

43:09.339 --> 43:10.423
So the started to
eat, other people.

43:14.302 --> 43:18.306
They killed them and when
they were down. Just dead.

43:20.100 --> 43:22.266
In a few hours,

43:22.268 --> 43:24.229
again they started to
reanimate and do the same!

43:26.314 --> 43:33.569
The government had to act,
so they had to eliminate them.

43:33.571 --> 43:36.116
They seized control of
the situation and the zone.

43:36.783 --> 43:38.825
There are healthy
people inside the zone.

43:38.827 --> 43:39.661
There definitely are.

44:16.906 --> 44:18.199
Guess you never think it's
going to happen to you.

44:25.790 --> 44:27.625
How much time?

44:30.420 --> 44:31.588
It's been like, two hours.

45:31.690 --> 45:33.858
Go now.

45:35.777 --> 45:36.611
Don't waste it.

48:02.632 --> 48:05.633
Thank you for your
infinite kindness God.

48:05.635 --> 48:09.470
Because you love us and free
us from contamination!

48:09.472 --> 48:12.223
From the sorrows,
pain and anguish.

48:12.225 --> 48:14.559
We bless your name, my Lord.

48:14.561 --> 48:17.812
We pray for this place.

48:17.814 --> 48:21.858
We pray for this
souls that listen.

48:21.860 --> 48:26.279
Because we know Holy Father,
that you have not left us.

48:26.281 --> 48:29.240
And have not forsaken us.
You are here wit us

48:29.242 --> 48:32.287
everyday, until the
end of the world.

48:37.417 --> 48:40.628
I think they took the right
measures in this.

48:43.048 --> 48:47.592
The government took the
infected corpses in quarantine.

48:47.594 --> 48:52.805
And they build a wall containing
the entire zone.

48:52.807 --> 48:56.392
They managed to evacuate all
the healthy people they could.

48:56.394 --> 49:00.273
And kept inside the zone all of
the infected.

49:04.611 --> 49:07.236
I cannot say it
wasn't difficult,

49:07.238 --> 49:08.740
only because it was
so surprising.

49:10.909 --> 49:15.328
But fortunately one
that has the means

49:15.330 --> 49:19.084
or the money, really, or
contacts. We managed to get out.

49:22.170 --> 49:25.799
Me and my family, my
two kids and my wife.

50:37.704 --> 50:40.621
DID YOU SURVIVE AN ATTACK?
DIAL 086

50:40.623 --> 50:42.542
THE CURE IS OUR COMMITMENT,
YOU CAN BE THE KEY.

53:52.899 --> 53:53.733
Who is it?

53:55.068 --> 53:56.945
Your neighbor!
You want something to eat?

53:59.364 --> 54:00.782
No, thanks!

54:01.116 --> 54:02.951
I'm about
to close the kitchen!

54:04.285 --> 54:05.120
Thank you.

54:07.497 --> 54:08.331
Sara, are you ok?

54:14.045 --> 54:15.463
Sara open the door!

54:20.635 --> 54:21.803
Sara?

54:24.681 --> 54:25.557
Sara?

54:27.684 --> 54:29.602
Are you ok?

54:34.024 --> 54:37.817
- Sorry I was busy.
- Aren't you hungry?

54:37.819 --> 54:40.737
- No no no.
- Are You okay?

54:40.739 --> 54:44.284
Yes, I am fine, I just need
to sleep so good night.

54:50.081 --> 54:51.291
Sara, can I see that?

54:53.335 --> 54:54.876
- What do you want?
- What happened to your arm?

54:54.878 --> 54:55.712
Did they bite you?!

55:00.175 --> 55:02.592
Let me go! Let go!

55:02.594 --> 55:04.346
Sara, when did they bite you?

55:11.478 --> 55:12.979
You know what we have
to do in this case.

55:17.317 --> 55:19.650
And we will be judged
for our deeds and the

55:19.652 --> 55:23.446
book of life will return
us for our miracles.

55:23.448 --> 55:27.450
And the false prophets will be
cast to the lake of brimstone.

55:27.452 --> 55:32.121
Blessed are the saints and who
believe in our Lord.

55:32.123 --> 55:37.710
And I saw the dead, men and
child, walk before God.

55:37.712 --> 55:43.174
Holy is the father in heaven.
Blessed are those

55:43.176 --> 55:46.094
who believe In the resurrection,
for heaven is theirs.

55:46.096 --> 55:47.762
Sara, be assured.

55:47.764 --> 55:48.723
It will be quick.

57:25.820 --> 57:28.821
It's been a while, and
a lot has happened.

57:28.823 --> 57:34.535
There can be people that may
have been bit by the reanimated.

57:34.537 --> 57:40.502
And may be immune. But it's hard
to pin down by us, here outside.

58:42.981 --> 58:45.982
Hi, I wanted to trade
you some things

58:45.984 --> 58:47.819
I need some food.

58:48.987 --> 58:49.821
What you got?

58:50.864 --> 58:51.823
Only these things.

58:53.074 --> 58:54.991
And, can I try the phone?

58:54.993 --> 58:55.827
Sure. Go ahead.

59:24.898 --> 59:29.778
Hi? Yes? Can you hear me?

59:32.489 --> 59:33.573
- Center for disease control.
- Yes.

59:35.492 --> 59:38.368
I am calling because I
survived an attack and I'm fine.

59:38.370 --> 59:40.828
Nothing has happened to me.

59:40.830 --> 59:45.124
I have nothing, I'm not sick and
don't know what's going on.

59:45.126 --> 59:46.169
I found this paper,
and that's why I'm calling.

59:48.838 --> 59:50.672
Look,
yesterday we received call

59:50.674 --> 59:52.715
from a case similar to yours.

59:52.717 --> 59:55.760
A guy said that his daughter
was bitten and was fine.

59:55.762 --> 59:57.597
We sent a unit but
found nothing.

01:00:00.016 --> 01:00:01.267
Look, those kinds of cases are
taken care of north of the zone.

01:00:03.478 --> 01:00:04.312
Yes.

01:00:06.481 --> 01:00:10.149
Yes, there you will find a tower

01:00:10.151 --> 01:00:11.653
and the watchman will
be waiting for you.

01:00:14.447 --> 01:00:17.242
Hello? Hey?!

01:00:28.795 --> 01:00:29.961
Is there food in there?

01:00:29.963 --> 01:00:30.797
Yes, there is too.

01:00:32.716 --> 01:00:33.591
Thank you.

01:01:03.830 --> 01:01:06.122
On the Internet, there
are many videos of

01:01:06.124 --> 01:01:08.541
what's happening
inside the zone.

01:01:08.543 --> 01:01:12.380
We can see things, like
when they take the infected

01:01:14.424 --> 01:01:17.344
and lock them up, they treat
them as pets in some cases

01:02:32.168 --> 01:02:33.962
Stay back.

01:02:38.049 --> 01:02:39.134
No!

01:03:22.594 --> 01:03:25.470
Is by this footage
that I can notice

01:03:25.472 --> 01:03:27.515
the changes in society
inside there.

01:03:29.559 --> 01:03:33.271
Of all the sane
people inside there.

01:08:28.108 --> 01:08:29.776
Where are you woman!

01:08:41.121 --> 01:08:42.788
Come on!

01:08:49.129 --> 01:08:50.714
Move it!

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:02.517
I'm going to kill you!

01:12:42.028 --> 01:12:46.864
I think that, the world, our
world split in to two.

01:12:46.866 --> 01:12:49.450
In that moment, its not that
I'm just saying

01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:52.370
but we live in
paradise, comparing to

01:12:52.372 --> 01:12:55.123
and if they live in hell.
Well it's their hell.

01:13:56.728 --> 01:13:58.480
Stop! Don't move!

01:14:01.483 --> 01:14:03.566
Turn around! Hands Up!

01:14:03.568 --> 01:14:04.402
They told me to get here!

01:14:10.450 --> 01:14:11.493
I survived an attack!

01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:16.081
Then why
are you here?!

01:14:17.665 --> 01:14:18.500
Don't turn around!

01:14:19.417 --> 01:14:20.543
I am not infected!

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:30.804
Ok, we are going to
check. We are coming down!

01:14:47.404 --> 01:14:51.030
Since the measures were taken,
you can see a before and after.

01:14:51.032 --> 01:14:54.867
We are living here in freedom.

01:14:54.869 --> 01:15:00.289
The separation is final;
we are two different worlds now.

01:15:00.291 --> 01:15:01.459
And we have to get used to that.

01:15:05.672 --> 01:15:09.342
I do believe that the measures
were the good ones.

01:15:12.137 --> 01:15:13.847
Until they find the cure.
