WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.882
- Previously on Gotham...
- You have five minutes, quiz kids.

00:03.969 --> 00:05.869
Wayne Enterprises runs Indian Hill,

00:06.031 --> 00:09.546
but who runs Wayne Enterprises?

00:09.664 --> 00:11.975
A weapon is en route
to destroy the city.

00:12.010 --> 00:14.976
I can't take on Nygma and Barbara

00:15.046 --> 00:16.513
and the rest of them by myself.

00:16.548 --> 00:17.847
Said you wanted to build an army, right?

00:17.883 --> 00:20.550
What about an army of freaks?

00:20.585 --> 00:21.885
Who ordered the hit on my father?

00:21.920 --> 00:23.186
Frank Gordon.

00:23.221 --> 00:25.655
- Your uncle.
- You have the right to remain silent.

00:28.527 --> 00:29.859
Dock 9C.

00:29.895 --> 00:31.327
It's where the weapon will be arriving.

00:31.363 --> 00:33.630
Jim, do I hear a favor coming on?

00:33.665 --> 00:36.299
What is coming into

00:36.334 --> 00:38.134
Dock 9C?

00:38.170 --> 00:39.969
Now I know who I am...

00:40.005 --> 00:41.271
I'm the Riddler.

00:42.374 --> 00:43.373
It's good to see you, too.

00:43.408 --> 00:45.141
How'd things go with Selina?

00:45.177 --> 00:47.544
This... is what I was made for.

00:47.579 --> 00:48.878
The clone is in place.

00:48.914 --> 00:50.413
Good evening, Alfred.

00:50.744 --> 00:52.148
And to you, Master Bruce.

00:52.184 --> 00:53.817
You need to join the Court of Owls, Jim.

00:53.852 --> 00:55.652
A woman named Kathryn is going to call.

00:55.687 --> 00:57.087
He would have been so proud of you.

00:57.122 --> 00:58.951
No!

01:00.559 --> 01:01.825
Kathryn, I presume.

01:01.860 --> 01:03.259
I killed my uncle.

01:03.295 --> 01:04.561
I make no apologies for it.

01:04.596 --> 01:05.922
Maybe it's time we meet.

01:05.947 --> 01:08.032
My thought exactly.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:35.966 --> 01:37.527
Hello?!

01:38.138 --> 01:39.395
Anyone home?

01:39.716 --> 01:42.458
When this guy gets home, we got
to ask him to kick on the heat.

01:42.563 --> 01:44.989
It's colder in here
than it is out there.

01:48.626 --> 01:50.140
Fascinating.

01:50.517 --> 01:52.398
I know you're hell-bent
on getting revenge

01:52.423 --> 01:53.562
on Nygma and all,

01:53.689 --> 01:56.626
and forming an army of freaks
is a great plan, I mean,

01:56.712 --> 01:57.981
it was my idea, but...

01:58.016 --> 02:00.136
Shh! Quiet.

02:00.401 --> 02:02.042
I think I hear something.

02:02.232 --> 02:04.128
Do you think it's him?

02:13.604 --> 02:15.905
Mr. Fries.

02:18.021 --> 02:19.112
Welcome home.

02:23.038 --> 02:24.817
I see you still hold me responsible

02:24.842 --> 02:28.118
for all of that awful monster rhetoric
I spewed during my campaign.

02:28.143 --> 02:30.299
You ran people like me out of Gotham.

02:30.682 --> 02:32.348
We both know I only said those things

02:32.384 --> 02:35.250
because that's
what the voters wanted to hear.

02:36.521 --> 02:38.477
Your experiments, Mr. Fries.

02:38.829 --> 02:41.719
You're trying to reverse
your condition, aren't you?

02:41.893 --> 02:43.500
I can help you.

02:44.089 --> 02:45.321
And why would you do that?

02:45.397 --> 02:47.616
My enemies took everything from me.

02:47.799 --> 02:49.499
Tried to murder me.

02:50.249 --> 02:52.186
You help me get my revenge,

02:52.452 --> 02:54.311
and when I take back
my throne, I will give you

02:54.382 --> 02:57.537
every resource you need to free
yourself from this icy prison.

03:01.178 --> 03:02.842
Even if I wanted to say yes,

03:02.867 --> 03:05.293
I can only survive
a few hours outside the cold

03:05.318 --> 03:06.783
without my suit.

03:07.512 --> 03:10.471
And you don't have it
because it's been locked away

03:10.496 --> 03:14.412
in a Wayne Enterprises black site
ever since you escaped Indian Hill.

03:15.893 --> 03:17.370
Ivy?

03:17.529 --> 03:18.901
Oh.

03:21.346 --> 03:22.523
Ta-da.

03:22.651 --> 03:23.666
My suit.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.413
So, Mr. Fries, will you join us?

03:38.350 --> 03:43.546
<font color="#0080ff">Synced & corrected by</font> kinglouisxx
<font color="#0080ff">www.</font>addic7ed<font color="#0080ff">.com</font>

03:49.491 --> 03:51.160
Where are we?

03:51.327 --> 03:54.038
Where we are is not important, James.

03:54.436 --> 03:57.225
What matters is why you're here.

03:57.826 --> 03:59.366
You know why I killed my uncle.

03:59.485 --> 04:01.037
Yes, I do.

04:01.216 --> 04:03.633
Frank murdered your father.

04:04.242 --> 04:08.289
What I need to know is if you hold
us accountable for his action.

04:08.772 --> 04:10.179
Frank acted alone.

04:10.490 --> 04:12.654
He admitted as much to me.

04:13.279 --> 04:14.490
Good.

04:15.387 --> 04:16.741
Then we can proceed.

04:17.373 --> 04:21.209
The city needs you now
more than ever, James.

04:21.326 --> 04:23.815
There's turmoil ahead,

04:23.929 --> 04:26.001
and good men like you
are going to be needed

04:26.026 --> 04:27.423
to hold it together.

04:27.448 --> 04:29.105
But make no mistake,

04:29.261 --> 04:33.414
the Court, and the Court alone,
can save Gotham.

04:34.297 --> 04:35.972
So what do you want me to do?

04:36.211 --> 04:38.841
Prove your loyalty to the Court.

04:40.111 --> 04:42.069
Killing my uncle wasn't enough?

04:42.215 --> 04:43.781
That was between you and Frank.

04:43.890 --> 04:45.915
It had nothing to do with us.

04:47.478 --> 04:49.953
When the time is right,
we will call upon you.

04:51.156 --> 04:53.823
And Frank's body?
It's still in the brownstone.

04:53.994 --> 04:56.215
We've already taken care of it.

04:59.316 --> 05:02.863
- Who's the stiff?
- Jim's uncle, Frank Gordon.

05:03.001 --> 05:04.133
Never met him.

05:04.238 --> 05:05.435
They were estranged.

05:05.470 --> 05:06.836
Have you seen Jim?

05:06.979 --> 05:08.571
He's working a case.

05:08.643 --> 05:11.311
Or he's walking in the door as we speak.

05:11.336 --> 05:14.577
Hey, Jim. Come in, we, uh,
have some bad news for you.

05:15.288 --> 05:16.675
What's going on?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.202
I'm sorry.

05:18.389 --> 05:20.456
We found your uncle's body this morning.

05:22.345 --> 05:23.953
He was pulled out of the harbor.

05:24.016 --> 05:25.219
I did my prelim.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.977
The burns on his left temple
suggest he was shot at close range.

05:28.055 --> 05:29.501
Lab is running ballistics.

05:29.743 --> 05:32.295
You saw him at the cemetery yesterday.
He seemed on edge.

05:32.330 --> 05:34.150
Did he say anything?

05:34.332 --> 05:35.939
No. He, uh,

05:36.063 --> 05:37.822
just stopped by to pay his respects.

05:38.603 --> 05:40.136
We didn't talk much.

05:40.854 --> 05:43.027
Thanks, Lee. I'll take it from here.

05:43.105 --> 05:44.807
That's it? That's your reaction?

05:45.215 --> 05:46.642
What do you want me to say?

05:48.313 --> 05:49.879
I know you.

05:50.116 --> 05:51.663
You're hiding something.

05:51.741 --> 05:53.273
- You know something.
- Lee, come on.

05:53.343 --> 05:54.888
The man just lost his uncle.

05:54.929 --> 05:56.863
Yeah, Harvey, you just
keep covering for him.

05:56.991 --> 05:58.521
My condolences.

06:02.247 --> 06:05.248
She's right. You do know
something, don't you?

06:05.646 --> 06:07.179
Uncle Frank shot himself.

06:07.866 --> 06:10.166
Said it was the only way
to get me inside the Court.

06:10.319 --> 06:13.302
- Did it work?
- I met with a woman named Kathryn.

06:13.635 --> 06:16.973
She says I have to prove
my loyalty to the Court first.

06:17.659 --> 06:20.081
Look, I see the need
for playing it cool.

06:20.432 --> 06:22.211
But right now,
the Court's readying a weapon

06:22.247 --> 06:23.479
that could destroy the city.

06:23.504 --> 06:26.349
We don't have time to sit
on our thumbs and do nothing.

06:26.384 --> 06:28.823
I don't like it any more than
you do, but if I push too hard,

06:28.956 --> 06:31.128
we might blow the only chance
we have at stopping this.

06:31.776 --> 06:33.523
And Uncle Frank will have died in vain.

06:33.737 --> 06:36.714
Okay, so what do we do now?

06:37.542 --> 06:40.329
Kathryn said to get back to work.
Keep up appearances.

06:40.431 --> 06:42.220
That shouldn't be too hard.

06:42.367 --> 06:44.399
- Look who resurfaced.
- _

06:47.539 --> 06:49.599
Hello?

06:50.108 --> 06:51.732
Ed?

06:52.396 --> 06:54.083
It's Barbara.

06:54.379 --> 06:57.107
Your old friend you've been blowing off.

06:59.384 --> 07:01.176
I'll allow you to call me Ed

07:01.262 --> 07:03.160
'cause we have history.

07:03.388 --> 07:05.145
But my name...

07:07.066 --> 07:08.424
is the Riddler.

07:08.887 --> 07:10.760
So the headlines say.

07:11.927 --> 07:13.230
Now, why are you here?

07:13.872 --> 07:15.614
When Penguin was mayor,

07:15.778 --> 07:17.708
did he mention a mysterious group?

07:17.896 --> 07:20.131
One that controlled
the levers of power in Gotham

07:20.156 --> 07:23.039
from the shadows with total impunity?

07:23.141 --> 07:26.042
- No.
- See, I didn't claw my way to the top

07:26.140 --> 07:28.242
only to find out
there was someone above me.

07:28.507 --> 07:30.578
I've been trying to find out
who they are,

07:30.664 --> 07:34.062
but no one in this town seems
to know anything about them.

07:34.273 --> 07:35.651
And how is it that you know about them?

07:36.491 --> 07:38.574
Jim Gordon put me onto them.

07:38.675 --> 07:41.308
And what is his interest in all this?

07:41.371 --> 07:42.281
He didn't say.

07:42.374 --> 07:46.218
But he did ask me
to investigate a shipment

07:46.320 --> 07:49.191
coming into Dock 9C yesterday.

07:49.253 --> 07:52.917
The harbormaster was protecting
a crate from Indian Hill.

07:53.026 --> 07:54.963
- What was inside?
- I don't know.

07:55.066 --> 07:57.853
Before I got a chance to
find out, some masked assassin

07:57.878 --> 07:59.675
slaughtered half my men.

08:01.339 --> 08:03.345
What do you know?

08:03.558 --> 08:05.237
When I was at Indian Hill,

08:05.659 --> 08:10.283
Professor Strange hinted at
some powerful, secret group,

08:10.361 --> 08:11.845
but he didn't tell me who they were.

08:12.970 --> 08:17.059
This is the one riddle that got away.

08:18.900 --> 08:20.910
I will...

08:21.332 --> 08:23.722
get you the answer you seek.

08:24.480 --> 08:26.621
But I will do it in my own way.

08:27.005 --> 08:29.939
You're gonna make a big
production of this, aren't you?

08:30.277 --> 08:32.777
Only someone with power and connections

08:32.863 --> 08:34.676
would have information on this group.

08:34.754 --> 08:37.246
I need to speak with Gotham's elite.

08:37.629 --> 08:40.025
And nothing brings out
the bourgeoisie quite like

08:40.142 --> 08:42.611
opening night at the theater.

08:43.164 --> 08:45.306
Where wilt thou lead me?

08:46.224 --> 08:47.689
Speak,

08:48.059 --> 08:50.412
for I will go no further.

08:58.786 --> 09:01.153
I say, Ghost,

09:01.419 --> 09:03.880
speak your business

09:05.067 --> 09:08.083
or I shall go no further!

09:08.213 --> 09:10.012
My business

09:10.381 --> 09:12.702
is not with you, Prince of Denmark.

09:12.850 --> 09:14.968
But with your audience.

09:21.194 --> 09:24.381
I've come to address you,

09:24.467 --> 09:27.319
the ruling class of Gotham.

09:27.432 --> 09:31.155
You've kept a secret for far too long.

09:31.302 --> 09:33.248
But tonight

09:33.571 --> 09:36.912
I will kidnap and torture one of you

09:37.075 --> 09:38.475
to expose the truth.

09:38.576 --> 09:42.045
So, spread the word to all your friends,

09:42.146 --> 09:45.214
the Riddler is coming.

09:46.670 --> 09:50.620
Also, I found your performance
to be wooden

09:50.693 --> 09:53.552
and unrealistic.

09:58.732 --> 10:01.247
And scene.

10:17.349 --> 10:19.364
And that, my old mucker,

10:19.518 --> 10:21.278
is checkmate.

10:24.918 --> 10:26.831
Good game, Alfred.

10:28.245 --> 10:29.993
You let me win, didn't you,
Master Bruce?

10:30.526 --> 10:32.830
- No way, Alfred.
- No way, my foot.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.399
That's very unlike you, isn't it?

10:35.948 --> 10:37.201
And to be honest, I mean,

10:37.236 --> 10:39.603
you haven't been yourself
these past few days, have you?

10:40.172 --> 10:41.839
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:41.874 --> 10:44.563
I think you do know what
I'm talking about, so come on.

10:48.285 --> 10:49.580
Out with it.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.512
The other day when I came home,

10:53.719 --> 10:55.285
you asked how things were with Selina.

10:55.582 --> 10:58.088
I made it sound like
things were hopeful.

10:59.725 --> 11:01.452
I lied.

11:02.428 --> 11:04.436
She said she never wanted
to see me again.

11:04.834 --> 11:06.396
I was embarrassed.

11:06.736 --> 11:08.454
I was afraid you'd...

11:08.768 --> 11:11.650
ask me about seeing Selina,
and I'd lie and...

11:13.352 --> 11:14.921
I just didn't want to talk about it.

11:15.310 --> 11:18.857
Well, then... I understand, Master B.

11:20.943 --> 11:23.013
And thank you very much
for being so candid.

11:25.036 --> 11:27.484
And I really wouldn't worry
about Ms. Kyle.

11:27.519 --> 11:31.788
You know, time has a way
of sorting these things out,

11:31.824 --> 11:32.722
doesn't it?

11:35.661 --> 11:37.949
Talking of which,
I should check on the dinner.

11:39.443 --> 11:40.742
Alfred.

11:40.833 --> 11:42.465
Sir?

11:43.469 --> 11:45.002
Thank you.

11:47.122 --> 11:49.036
You're a good friend.

11:50.035 --> 11:51.918
Glad to hear it, sir.

12:16.090 --> 12:17.770
It's me.

12:18.360 --> 12:20.168
It's happening again.

12:23.223 --> 12:24.927
Hey.

12:25.632 --> 12:28.076
So, the audience has been accounted for.

12:28.347 --> 12:30.466
Uh, is this Hamlet?

12:31.029 --> 12:32.983
I guess he wasn't meant to be.

12:33.174 --> 12:35.986
You crossed paths with Nygma recently.

12:36.021 --> 12:38.244
Any idea what this secret is
he's talking about?

12:38.324 --> 12:39.723
No, I have no clue.

12:39.799 --> 12:41.224
My guess is he just made it up.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.493
Captain, we got the all clear.

12:43.529 --> 12:44.945
All right.

13:00.457 --> 13:02.463
This is all that's in there.

13:10.622 --> 13:11.922
It's a riddle.

13:11.957 --> 13:13.258
Shocker.

13:13.644 --> 13:17.054
Written in iambic pentameter
like a Shakespearean sonnet.

13:17.363 --> 13:20.076
"I am a man who holds a high position,

13:20.299 --> 13:22.699
"Who shows two faces
to all those he rules,

13:22.861 --> 13:26.271
"A fraud, criminal,
and sometime politician.

13:26.572 --> 13:29.889
Gotham, my constituency of fools."

13:30.615 --> 13:32.376
A two-faced politician

13:32.411 --> 13:35.225
whose constituency is Gotham. The mayor?

13:35.366 --> 13:39.068
"Fraud, criminal" sounds
like he's describing Penguin,

13:39.093 --> 13:40.896
but that doesn't make any sense.

13:41.043 --> 13:43.365
Ed told Lucius he killed Penguin.

13:43.576 --> 13:45.068
Aubrey James.

13:45.192 --> 13:47.559
He was recently reinstated
and he's been mayor before.

13:47.748 --> 13:50.260
"Sometime politician,"
but why not just grab him?

13:50.560 --> 13:51.895
Why tell us in advance?

13:51.930 --> 13:53.363
Because Nygma wants to make a show of it

13:53.459 --> 13:54.965
and make us look bad in the process.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.560
Call the mayor's office.
Tell him we're on our way.

14:03.433 --> 14:06.543
We don't need Nygma for anything.
He should be dead by now.

14:06.644 --> 14:10.280
He's obsessed with finding the answer,
which is an easy solution for us.

14:10.337 --> 14:12.602
Once he does, we'll get rid of him.

14:12.727 --> 14:13.817
I promise.

14:14.391 --> 14:16.825
And how's him causing a scene
at the theater help us?

14:17.015 --> 14:18.793
It doesn't.

14:19.309 --> 14:20.848
But it does help me more

14:20.959 --> 14:24.489
fully announce myself
on the Gotham stage.

14:24.801 --> 14:26.815
If you'll forgive the pun.

14:27.299 --> 14:28.331
Do you want to become famous?

14:28.581 --> 14:30.042
Try dying.

14:30.174 --> 14:33.284
- I can help you with that.
- Okay, that's enough.

14:34.401 --> 14:36.170
What actually is your plan?

14:37.569 --> 14:39.393
Kidnap Mayor James.

14:40.579 --> 14:42.977
The man ran this place for ten years.

14:43.098 --> 14:46.278
If anyone knows about this
mysterious group, he does.

14:46.303 --> 14:47.872
You could've just said that.

14:47.966 --> 14:49.903
I could've had him here, being tortured.

14:50.356 --> 14:53.403
Okay. See, but first
I had to tell the GCPD

14:53.528 --> 14:54.997
what I was going to do.

14:55.177 --> 14:58.232
How else am I supposed to properly
embarrass them publicly?

14:58.431 --> 15:01.349
My crimes must live up to my name,

15:01.483 --> 15:02.843
and this is no exception.

15:02.929 --> 15:05.507
And what if the mayor doesn't know
anything about this group?

15:05.587 --> 15:07.890
Hmm? What then?

15:07.968 --> 15:09.456
I have a plan B to smoke them out,

15:09.563 --> 15:13.627
but first... I need something from you.

15:14.126 --> 15:16.532
There's a biker bar on the
corner of Spaulding and Eighth.

15:16.665 --> 15:18.265
It's full of brawlers, lowlifes.

15:18.493 --> 15:20.897
I need a bomb

15:21.036 --> 15:22.843
to detonate there.

15:23.335 --> 15:24.780
Tonight.

15:25.107 --> 15:26.554
I'll let you know when.

15:26.675 --> 15:27.941
So tell us, genius,

15:28.319 --> 15:29.930
how do you plan to get Aubrey James

15:29.955 --> 15:32.135
now that you've told the GCPD
you're going after him?

15:32.213 --> 15:33.783
Oh, that's simple.

15:34.236 --> 15:36.483
They're gonna bring him to me.

15:41.230 --> 15:43.757
You know how many crooked politicians
there are in this city?

15:43.909 --> 15:45.737
This riddle could be for anyone.

15:45.828 --> 15:47.327
Oh, my gosh, these are delicious.

15:47.352 --> 15:48.475
All the same, Mr. Mayor,

15:48.500 --> 15:51.131
we'd like to move you
to a safe house immediately.

15:51.584 --> 15:54.134
Did you not see
the muscle twins over there?

15:54.366 --> 15:56.288
I'm perfectly safe here.

15:56.405 --> 15:58.398
Besides, what's the Riddler
want with me, anyway?

15:58.461 --> 15:59.867
We're not really sure.

15:59.975 --> 16:03.554
He did say something to the crowd
at the theater about a secret.

16:04.880 --> 16:06.955
My life's an open book.

16:08.502 --> 16:11.051
Are you feeling okay, Mr. Mayor?
You look a little...

16:11.182 --> 16:13.908
It's my blood sugar.
I've had too many of these Danishes.

16:14.067 --> 16:15.962
Where are my pills?

16:16.158 --> 16:17.624
Wait a minute, where'd you get these?

16:17.830 --> 16:20.026
An appreciative citizen. Why?

16:22.406 --> 16:23.663
Oh, boy.

16:23.766 --> 16:25.258
Nygma.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.664
This is bad.

16:39.015 --> 16:40.648
Coming through.

16:47.954 --> 16:50.156
Yeah, I think I'll pass.

16:50.394 --> 16:52.094
You cannot be serious.

16:52.129 --> 16:55.097
I've seen mass graves more
inviting than this place.

16:55.578 --> 16:58.272
Strange messed me up pretty good.

16:58.297 --> 16:59.323
He convinced me

16:59.357 --> 17:01.132
I was some sort of goddess,

17:01.319 --> 17:03.561
and it took me a long time to get over it.

17:03.586 --> 17:06.428
Now, this place might be bad,
but Gotham is worse.

17:06.453 --> 17:08.830
Hey, freak! You're on company time.

17:09.290 --> 17:10.776
Get back to work.

17:12.675 --> 17:14.652
You don't have to take that.

17:14.855 --> 17:18.683
- You should totally kick his ass.
- Yeah, but he's my boss.

17:18.810 --> 17:22.278
Bridgit, there is nothing wrong
with being a freak.

17:23.615 --> 17:25.181
I'm a freak.

17:25.416 --> 17:26.845
So is Penguin.

17:26.984 --> 17:28.284
You belong with us.

17:30.488 --> 17:32.699
We've met before, haven't we?

17:32.724 --> 17:35.024
Yeah. I'm Ivy Pepper.

17:35.149 --> 17:36.860
Selina's friend.

17:37.162 --> 17:40.134
Oh, I know. I ran into
one of Strange's puppies.

17:40.159 --> 17:41.397
Kind of had a growth spurt.

17:41.433 --> 17:43.644
Though, to be honest,
I'm not complaining.

17:44.120 --> 17:45.863
Ivy.

17:46.263 --> 17:48.225
And you're part of this?

17:48.306 --> 17:51.441
Yeah. It's almost like we're a family.

17:52.170 --> 17:54.397
You don't have to be alone anymore.

17:56.539 --> 17:59.199
I could kill your boss
just to sweeten the deal.

18:01.565 --> 18:02.975
Nah.

18:07.315 --> 18:08.807
Hey, you.

18:08.853 --> 18:10.235
I quit.

18:19.938 --> 18:22.126
Thank you for letting me come in.

18:22.759 --> 18:24.507
The nosebleeds are getting worse.

18:24.610 --> 18:26.483
You did the right thing coming here.

18:26.735 --> 18:29.104
- What did you tell Alfred?
- Nothing.

18:29.681 --> 18:32.443
I said I was tired,
then snuck out of my room.

18:38.890 --> 18:40.423
I'm dying, aren't I?

18:40.606 --> 18:41.958
Yes.

18:42.263 --> 18:43.593
I'm sorry.

18:43.825 --> 18:46.996
The process that brought you
into this world was flawed.

18:48.099 --> 18:50.333
Will I die before Bruce returns?

18:50.368 --> 18:53.310
No, Bruce Wayne will be back
in Gotham well before then.

18:55.373 --> 18:58.529
I know we've asked a lot of you.

18:59.592 --> 19:03.279
After Indian Hill I didn't know
what to do or where to go.

19:04.382 --> 19:06.557
You gave me a purpose.

19:07.886 --> 19:09.869
That's more than most people could say.

19:09.954 --> 19:12.455
I'm glad you see it that way.

19:14.159 --> 19:16.101
When Bruce returns...

19:17.729 --> 19:19.969
people are going to die, aren't they?

19:20.282 --> 19:21.639
A lot of people.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.626
You haven't gotten attached
to anyone, have you?

19:25.133 --> 19:27.243
Alfred, perhaps?

19:27.571 --> 19:28.971
You've spoken fondly of him.

19:29.007 --> 19:30.230
No.

19:31.332 --> 19:33.186
I just want to know.

19:34.441 --> 19:37.012
The number is immaterial.

19:37.863 --> 19:41.319
What matters is that Gotham must fall.

19:41.886 --> 19:44.592
And because of your sacrifice, it will.

19:46.925 --> 19:48.631
Can we count on you?

19:50.105 --> 19:51.621
Yes.

19:53.498 --> 19:55.198
His BP's dropping.

19:55.233 --> 19:57.423
- We need to stabilize him!
- I want this ER secured.

19:57.448 --> 20:00.079
Badge access only. No one gets in

20:00.104 --> 20:01.759
- unless they're sick or dying.
- 10-4.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.181
Nygma knows this is the closest
hospital to the mayor's office.

20:04.206 --> 20:05.366
We brought him right to him.

20:05.410 --> 20:08.077
Great, let him show his face.
I got unis all over the place.

20:08.112 --> 20:10.046
But what are we missing, Harvey?

20:10.081 --> 20:12.371
What could Aubrey James know
that's so important to Nygma?

20:12.418 --> 20:14.852
<i>Paging Detective James Gordon.</i>

20:14.919 --> 20:17.687
<i>- Paging Detective James Gordon.</i>
- Where's that coming from?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.264
Communications room. Second floor.

20:19.319 --> 20:21.116
- It's a trap.
<i>- Please don't kill me!</i>

20:21.141 --> 20:23.067
<i>Please don't kill me!</i>

20:23.092 --> 20:24.114
You stay here.

20:25.114 --> 20:26.989
<i>So, Jimbo,</i>

20:27.083 --> 20:31.540
<i>I know you must be wondering what
I want from that ding-dong Aubrey James.</i>

20:32.143 --> 20:36.073
<i>Well... turns out,
he has answers to a riddle,</i>

20:36.241 --> 20:39.621
<i>one that you put into motion
when you sent Barbara down to Dock 9C.</i>

20:39.813 --> 20:43.517
<i>The question being, who runs Gotham?</i>

20:45.360 --> 20:47.374
- I got to get out of here.
- No, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:47.399 --> 20:49.591
Mr. Mayor, you're in no
condition to go anywhere.

20:52.320 --> 20:53.856
Jim. Tell me you got him.

20:53.958 --> 20:55.317
He wasn't there.

20:55.342 --> 20:57.937
But the secret he's after,
it's the Court.

20:58.224 --> 21:00.229
Lidocaine and an IV push.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.950
<i>- You better get back here quick.</i>
- What is it?

21:04.035 --> 21:06.435
There was some kind of explosion.
A lot of victims.

21:06.460 --> 21:08.326
- I got a bad feeling.
<i>- It's him.</i>

21:08.373 --> 21:09.909
Don't leave the mayor's side.

21:10.448 --> 21:11.941
Authorized personnel only.

21:11.976 --> 21:14.143
Hell with that. My friends got blown up!

21:25.035 --> 21:26.367
Hello, Aubrey.

21:47.232 --> 21:48.661
We got company.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.141
Where is she?

21:50.685 --> 21:51.934
Not here.

21:51.959 --> 21:54.259
I know she and Nygma
kidnapped Mayor James.

21:54.364 --> 21:57.286
Nygma mentioned Dock 9C and
she's the only one I told.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.431
Nygma's got a big mouth.

21:59.466 --> 22:01.028
Wait, wait, wait,
let me get this straight.

22:01.168 --> 22:04.036
You mean this whole stupid
riddle thing with Nygma is real?

22:04.697 --> 22:07.306
What? He clearly knows
everything already.

22:08.776 --> 22:10.369
I heard a rumor

22:10.651 --> 22:13.305
he hurt you pretty bad
a while back, both of you.

22:13.517 --> 22:15.322
Surprised you're defending him.

22:15.596 --> 22:17.356
Listen, you tell me where they are,

22:17.602 --> 22:19.321
I'll take Nygma down,

22:19.813 --> 22:21.594
but I'll give Barbara a free pass.

22:26.611 --> 22:28.701
It's true. I hate him.

22:30.024 --> 22:31.557
But I don't know where they are.

22:35.181 --> 22:37.103
Harvey?

22:37.378 --> 22:39.439
Okay. I'll be right there.

22:39.714 --> 22:41.610
Nygma sent another riddle.

22:41.647 --> 22:43.580
Never should have brought
Barbara into this.

22:43.702 --> 22:45.768
You better hope I get to her first.

22:47.255 --> 22:49.184
You should have given that freak up.

22:49.428 --> 22:51.361
No one wants Nygma dead more than me.

22:52.460 --> 22:54.093
But I can't betray Barbara.

22:54.497 --> 22:55.661
Yeah.

22:55.747 --> 22:58.083
'Cause she's always got
your best interests at heart.

23:02.275 --> 23:03.517
Listen.

23:03.638 --> 23:05.666
You're in way over your head
on this one.

23:05.853 --> 23:07.740
You don't want to mess
with these people.

23:07.885 --> 23:09.951
You see, everything that you say

23:10.103 --> 23:11.537
just makes me more intrigued.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.140
And determined.

23:14.779 --> 23:18.511
I will be the one who unmasks them.

23:18.573 --> 23:19.785
You're insane.

23:20.980 --> 23:23.456
Remember me, Aubrey?

23:24.050 --> 23:25.894
I know that voice.

23:25.993 --> 23:27.769
I'm so glad.

23:28.269 --> 23:30.907
I thought maybe it got muffled.

23:31.066 --> 23:33.499
We put that box on your head.

23:34.669 --> 23:38.245
That was fun. We should do
that again for old times' sake.

23:38.606 --> 23:40.370
You don't get it, do you?

23:40.807 --> 23:42.228
These people, they're...

23:42.253 --> 23:44.276
they're like God.
They see and hear everything.

23:44.312 --> 23:45.678
They'll know I talked.

23:45.745 --> 23:47.735
Then it's the box.

23:47.807 --> 23:50.180
No, no, no. Please, a-anything but that.

23:53.829 --> 23:56.350
They call themselves the Court.

23:57.694 --> 23:58.912
And?

23:59.393 --> 24:00.993
That's all I know.

24:01.241 --> 24:03.123
I-I've never met these people.

24:03.248 --> 24:05.164
I just did what they asked me to, I swear.

24:08.502 --> 24:11.266
Very good! Thank you, Mr. Mayor.

24:11.376 --> 24:13.422
You've been very helpful.

24:14.575 --> 24:15.852
Helpful?

24:15.977 --> 24:17.843
All he gave us was "the Court."

24:18.080 --> 24:20.931
He gave us tangible evidence
of their existence.

24:21.382 --> 24:22.982
Now they'll know I'm not bluffing.

24:23.338 --> 24:24.984
What are you talking about?

24:25.019 --> 24:28.554
I'm going to force the Court
to reveal themselves.

24:29.690 --> 24:32.358
What is the one thing that every
secret organization is afraid of?

24:32.685 --> 24:34.216
Being exposed.

24:35.329 --> 24:37.062
Bingo.

24:38.933 --> 24:40.933
Finally. Did you bring what I asked for?

24:47.316 --> 24:49.041
It's time to get the Court's attention.

24:51.854 --> 24:53.322
Baby...

24:53.547 --> 24:56.115
Gordon came to the club.
He knows everything.

24:57.852 --> 24:59.875
You should have never gotten
Nygma involved.

25:12.030 --> 25:14.677
I boosted the premium stuff, Otto.

25:16.863 --> 25:18.483
You're welcome.

25:21.108 --> 25:22.536
Hello, Selina.

25:24.848 --> 25:26.512
What the hell are you doing here?

25:26.747 --> 25:28.474
I wanted to see you.

25:29.099 --> 25:30.549
I missed you.

25:30.669 --> 25:33.252
Did you fall on your head?
I told you to stay away.

25:33.287 --> 25:35.005
You did?

25:35.656 --> 25:37.056
I forgot.

25:38.092 --> 25:39.831
Why are you acting so weird?

25:40.378 --> 25:42.307
I'm... I'm sorry.

25:42.417 --> 25:44.589
I didn't sleep well last night.

25:44.732 --> 25:46.308
Uh-huh.

25:47.234 --> 25:49.103
Well, I just came to feed my cat.

25:49.128 --> 25:50.869
So, if you're not gonna leave, I am.

25:50.961 --> 25:52.852
I promised myself I'd stay away.

25:53.944 --> 25:55.836
That it would be safer that way, but...

25:56.281 --> 25:57.476
things have changed.

25:57.687 --> 25:59.278
What are you talking about?

25:59.719 --> 26:01.313
You know what? I don't care.

26:01.348 --> 26:03.267
Just don't be here when I get back.

26:03.292 --> 26:04.884
Selina, wait.

26:09.156 --> 26:11.276
I am not Bruce.

26:15.296 --> 26:16.595
Jim?

26:16.682 --> 26:19.518
- Lee, now is not a good time.
- Your uncle's autopsy.

26:19.659 --> 26:22.217
Ballistics came back negative. No match.

26:22.303 --> 26:24.570
But there were microscopic
tears along the entry wound,

26:24.605 --> 26:26.108
made postmortem.

26:26.397 --> 26:27.806
What are you saying?

26:27.944 --> 26:30.476
Someone removed the bullet
that killed your uncle

26:30.511 --> 26:32.077
and replaced it with another one.

26:32.158 --> 26:34.180
It's an old mob trick
to cover up a murder.

26:34.205 --> 26:36.266
- You're reaching, Lee.
- I don't think so.

26:36.291 --> 26:38.586
And I think you know what happened.

26:38.915 --> 26:40.352
Listen to me.

26:40.387 --> 26:42.538
You need to drop this.
You could get yourself hurt.

26:42.563 --> 26:44.423
You think I care what happens to me?

26:44.532 --> 26:46.258
I am sick of watching you

26:46.293 --> 26:48.494
destroy people's lives
and get away with it.

26:48.529 --> 26:50.175
When I find out what you did,

26:50.397 --> 26:53.132
I'm gonna make sure you pay for it.
And I'm gonna enjoy it.

26:53.167 --> 26:54.133
Jim, hey.

27:02.700 --> 27:05.511
- Where's the riddle?
- Me and Lucius took a crack at it,

27:05.546 --> 27:07.786
but maybe you'll have better luck.

27:08.036 --> 27:11.076
"You can see me,
but you cannot touch me.

27:11.552 --> 27:14.288
"The flick of a switch,
I enter your home.

27:14.522 --> 27:16.811
"With another, I leave you alone.

27:17.318 --> 27:18.357
Where am I?"

27:18.392 --> 27:20.459
He's taunting us. If he kills James,

27:20.585 --> 27:24.076
the press is gonna hand us
our asses on the 6:00 news.

27:24.178 --> 27:25.564
Harvey, you're a genius.

27:25.756 --> 27:27.599
Yeah, tell me something I don't know.

27:29.270 --> 27:30.879
<i>I have a question.</i>

27:31.005 --> 27:34.090
<i>What is this mysterious "Court"</i>

27:34.192 --> 27:37.409
<i>that controls the levers
of power here in Gotham?</i>

27:37.444 --> 27:39.144
Alvarez, go to channel seven!

27:39.180 --> 27:41.046
Find out where Nygma's broadcasting from.

27:41.081 --> 27:45.595
<i>...let our dear mayor's head
be blown to bits</i>

27:45.686 --> 27:48.187
<i>in order to keep their anonymity?</i>

27:53.460 --> 27:54.737
<i>Are you watching the television?</i>

27:54.762 --> 27:55.861
I am.

27:55.896 --> 27:59.025
The Court cannot be exposed.

27:59.700 --> 28:01.420
We would clean this up on our own,

28:01.445 --> 28:03.602
but there are too many eyes watching.

28:03.818 --> 28:08.029
<i>However, this does afford us
an opportunity, James.</i>

28:08.123 --> 28:09.932
To prove my loyalty.

28:10.770 --> 28:13.395
You want me to find Nygma
and bring him to you?

28:13.948 --> 28:17.549
I understand this puts you
in a difficult position.

28:17.808 --> 28:20.245
He's a cop killer. He belongs in prison.

28:20.321 --> 28:23.050
<i>If you decline, this
conversation will be our last.</i>

28:23.123 --> 28:24.556
The choice is yours.

28:26.060 --> 28:27.392
That was the Court.

28:27.988 --> 28:29.674
If I hand him over, I'm in.

28:29.699 --> 28:31.563
- They'll probably kill him.
- And if I don't,

28:31.599 --> 28:33.855
we'll never stop them
from destroying the city.

28:34.910 --> 28:36.635
<i>I know what you're thinking, Aubrey.</i>

28:36.737 --> 28:40.405
That the police are gonna
somehow find you, rescue you.

28:40.877 --> 28:44.213
But I gave the GCPD
every chance to save you.

28:44.393 --> 28:48.244
<i>But they're no match for me!</i>

28:50.149 --> 28:51.947
We're both dead men.

28:52.455 --> 28:54.598
You don't get it, do you?

28:55.403 --> 28:58.098
The Court isn't gonna bargain with you.

28:58.864 --> 29:00.892
You underestimate me, Mr. James.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.332
- Hello.
- Nygma.

29:09.803 --> 29:11.480
<i>Jim, I'm so sorry.</i>

29:11.505 --> 29:12.904
We can't be clogging up the lines.

29:12.940 --> 29:14.473
I'm actually expecting
an important call.

29:14.501 --> 29:16.668
<i>You want to know who runs Gotham?</i>

29:16.816 --> 29:18.076
<i>I have the answer.</i>

29:18.112 --> 29:21.269
Come by the GCPD. I'll tell it to you.

29:21.386 --> 29:23.448
Hmm. Yeah, I think I'll pass on that.

29:23.484 --> 29:24.916
<i>Then you'll never know the truth.</i>

29:25.213 --> 29:27.219
You think I told Barbara
everything I know?

29:28.289 --> 29:31.775
You always were clever, Jim.
I respect that.

29:32.025 --> 29:34.026
<i>Empty out the GCPD.</i>

29:34.201 --> 29:36.528
<i>I want it to just be you and me.</i>

29:36.709 --> 29:38.363
<i>Alone.</i>

29:38.399 --> 29:42.167
<i>Well, and this idiot
with the bomb around his neck.</i>

29:48.332 --> 29:49.879
You think he'll show?

29:50.222 --> 29:52.667
The thing that drives
Nygma is also his weakness.

29:52.732 --> 29:53.839
He'll be here.

29:53.864 --> 29:56.222
It's not like every man,
woman and child in Gotham

29:56.247 --> 29:58.066
isn't depending on you to succeed.

29:58.091 --> 30:00.309
Yeah. No pressure.

30:02.301 --> 30:04.489
- Good luck, pal.
- Thanks.

30:11.026 --> 30:12.192
Where's Ed?

30:12.220 --> 30:14.414
That lunatic dropped me off.
Sent me in alone.

30:14.439 --> 30:17.156
- Get the bomb squad in here!
- Sit down and shut up.

30:19.644 --> 30:20.726
Ed?

30:20.824 --> 30:22.925
It's just the two of us in here.

30:25.032 --> 30:27.266
Just wanted to make sure
I wasn't walking into a trap.

30:28.730 --> 30:29.882
Nah, ah, ah.

30:31.015 --> 30:32.771
Sit down, Aubrey.

30:36.173 --> 30:38.423
You said you have the answer
I was looking for, Jim.

30:38.493 --> 30:40.346
It would be incredibly disappointing

30:40.381 --> 30:43.137
if this was all a ruse.
More so for Mayor James.

30:43.162 --> 30:44.483
Just tell him what he wants.

30:44.685 --> 30:46.185
He talks too much.

30:47.955 --> 30:49.943
You should probably just go ahead
and blow him up.

30:50.024 --> 30:51.523
I'll have your badge, Gordon.

30:53.094 --> 30:54.634
I'm not bluffing, Jim.

30:54.762 --> 30:56.853
Neither am I.

30:57.098 --> 30:59.365
What's the blast radius on
that thing? Am I good here?

30:59.400 --> 31:01.775
Or should I... duck behind a desk?

31:01.800 --> 31:04.203
I want the answer, Jim!

31:07.775 --> 31:12.378
I kill him, I still walk out
of here with you as my hostage.

31:15.583 --> 31:16.882
No!

31:16.917 --> 31:17.750
No!

31:19.403 --> 31:20.819
No!

31:22.137 --> 31:23.822
Oh, come on.

31:25.237 --> 31:26.821
There's a radio frequency

31:26.846 --> 31:29.048
jamming the signal between
the detonator and the bomb.

31:29.080 --> 31:31.096
- How?
- Tabitha.

31:31.265 --> 31:33.060
She holds quite the grudge against you.

31:33.119 --> 31:34.099
She called me.

31:34.135 --> 31:36.268
Told me how to disarm the bomb.

31:39.329 --> 31:41.106
I'll admit, I didn't see this coming.

31:42.276 --> 31:44.650
But that doesn't change anything.

31:44.812 --> 31:46.243
I want...

31:46.447 --> 31:48.096
to know...

31:48.449 --> 31:50.229
who the Court is.

31:51.771 --> 31:53.377
Or Aubrey dies.

31:55.022 --> 31:56.288
Don't!

31:59.627 --> 32:01.260
You want to know who runs Gotham?

32:02.052 --> 32:04.075
Then let Mayor James go.

32:04.665 --> 32:06.177
Take a ride with me.

32:06.267 --> 32:07.903
But if you pull that trigger,

32:08.035 --> 32:10.135
you'll never get the answer
you're looking for.

32:12.039 --> 32:13.982
You fool me once, Jim,

32:14.175 --> 32:16.178
shame on you.

32:17.178 --> 32:19.170
You fool me twice...

32:20.281 --> 32:21.780
...well, that's just not gonna happen.

32:21.816 --> 32:23.902
Then the riddle will go unsolved.

32:30.878 --> 32:32.791
Fine!

32:39.477 --> 32:40.777
Let's go.

32:43.571 --> 32:45.355
<i>Let me get this straight.</i>

32:45.506 --> 32:49.975
So, this limo pulls up
literally out of nowhere,

32:50.066 --> 32:53.679
and this creepy lady tells you
to get in because

32:53.714 --> 32:56.428
"you could be so much more"?

32:56.851 --> 32:58.183
And you did?

32:58.350 --> 33:00.006
I had nowhere else to go.

33:00.131 --> 33:02.029
So where have you been
the last few months?

33:02.079 --> 33:03.412
It's not important.

33:03.557 --> 33:05.190
What matters is
you need to leave Gotham.

33:05.226 --> 33:06.892
- Right away.
- Why?

33:07.693 --> 33:09.372
Because the city has been judged.

33:09.443 --> 33:12.364
- And something bad is going to happen.
- Judged by who?

33:14.902 --> 33:16.573
The people who took you?

33:17.037 --> 33:19.901
Wait a minute, your clothes, your hair,

33:20.198 --> 33:21.840
the way you talk.

33:25.246 --> 33:26.478
Where is Bruce?

33:26.594 --> 33:29.024
- Selina...
- What did you do to him?

33:29.049 --> 33:30.582
He's fine. He's not in Gotham.

33:30.829 --> 33:32.584
But nothing bad is going
to happen to him.

33:32.620 --> 33:34.653
- Then where is he?
- It doesn't matter.

33:34.688 --> 33:37.189
You just have to trust me.
You need to leave Gotham today.

33:37.224 --> 33:38.624
Trust you?

33:40.433 --> 33:43.130
- I don't even know you.
- Where you going?

33:44.231 --> 33:45.430
To tell Alfred.

33:45.466 --> 33:47.402
- Selina...
- Now let me go!

33:47.427 --> 33:50.035
- Selina, you can't tell anyone.
- Then why the hell did you tell me?

33:52.773 --> 33:54.540
Because I care about you.

33:55.197 --> 33:57.209
And if there's one
person I want to save,

33:57.244 --> 33:58.861
I want it to be you.

34:01.415 --> 34:05.417
That's the difference
between you and Bruce Wayne.

34:07.054 --> 34:09.562
He would try and save everyone.

34:11.000 --> 34:16.527
You can pretend all you want,
but you will never be him.

34:16.730 --> 34:18.263
You're nothing.

34:18.420 --> 34:20.293
You're not even a real person.

34:21.735 --> 34:22.967
You don't matter.

34:25.947 --> 34:28.012
You're wrong about me.

34:28.911 --> 34:30.844
I do matter.

34:31.411 --> 34:32.811
And I won't let you tell Alfred.

34:32.943 --> 34:34.553
Oh, yeah?

34:34.996 --> 34:36.371
How you gonna stop...

35:09.610 --> 35:14.285
You remember the night you
came over to Lee's for dinner?

35:15.937 --> 35:17.929
It was like a lifetime ago.

35:18.094 --> 35:20.539
Leslie made fondue.

35:21.063 --> 35:23.240
The wine was a Bordeaux.

35:24.279 --> 35:26.951
Well-aged. Smooth tannins.

35:28.771 --> 35:32.365
Ms. Kringle wore a black dress
with pink trim.

35:33.476 --> 35:35.376
I tried like hell to get out of it.

35:37.558 --> 35:39.024
But Lee insisted.

35:39.703 --> 35:42.116
The truth is, I had a good time.

35:45.421 --> 35:47.121
I considered you a friend.

35:49.392 --> 35:51.025
I can sneak up on you

35:51.190 --> 35:53.526
or be right in front of you
without you even knowing.

35:53.663 --> 35:55.690
But when I reveal myself,

35:57.054 --> 35:58.899
you will never be the same. What am I?

35:58.924 --> 36:01.325
- I don't care, Ed...
- Betrayal.

36:03.439 --> 36:04.972
That's how every friendship ends.

36:05.490 --> 36:06.850
So...

36:07.276 --> 36:09.576
so what good are friends anyway?

36:23.259 --> 36:24.558
Who are they?

36:24.593 --> 36:26.407
The answer to your question.

36:45.435 --> 36:47.216
Hello, Mr. Nygma.

36:47.427 --> 36:49.239
I hear you've been asking about us.

36:49.380 --> 36:51.185
How do I know you're real?

36:52.655 --> 36:55.082
Isn't that the point of a good mystery?

36:55.481 --> 36:58.659
You're never quite sure what
to believe until the end.

36:59.082 --> 37:00.761
Gordon could've put you up to this.

37:00.786 --> 37:01.719
I assure you,

37:01.744 --> 37:05.610
Detective Gordon had to be
convinced to bring you here.

37:06.357 --> 37:08.250
But let me put it like this:

37:08.685 --> 37:11.598
that question Professor
Strange had you ask

37:11.623 --> 37:15.240
Bruce Wayne and Lucius Fox
last year at Indian Hill,

37:15.571 --> 37:18.378
the one that has tortured you,

37:18.914 --> 37:21.839
the one you'll never be able to answer.

37:22.089 --> 37:23.679
That answer is with me.

37:27.723 --> 37:29.007
What now?

37:29.158 --> 37:30.499
Get in.

37:30.659 --> 37:33.227
And all your questions will be answered.

37:34.649 --> 37:36.063
You won't be needing the gun.

37:59.722 --> 38:02.462
You've made us proud, Detective Gordon.

38:02.758 --> 38:04.591
What are you going to do with him?

38:04.707 --> 38:08.480
A man with Nygma's intellect
could be quite useful to us.

38:08.715 --> 38:10.898
I'm sure we'll find
something for him to do.

38:12.762 --> 38:14.270
We'll be in touch.

38:19.731 --> 38:24.043
♪ Till the fearless come ♪

38:24.113 --> 38:27.328
♪ And the act is done ♪

38:27.353 --> 38:29.783
♪ A love like blood ♪

38:29.819 --> 38:31.418
♪ A love like blood ♪

38:36.477 --> 38:38.692
Good evening, Ms. Kean.
May I offer you a drink?

38:40.629 --> 38:42.129
Something went wrong.

38:42.154 --> 38:43.999
Gordon took down Nygma
before he could find out

38:43.999 --> 38:45.699
the truth about the Court.

38:46.021 --> 38:48.763
Probably 'cause I told Gordon
how to disarm the bomb.

38:48.825 --> 38:50.254
What?

38:50.504 --> 38:52.238
Why?

38:52.308 --> 38:54.894
You promised that when Nygma
handed over the underworld,

38:54.927 --> 38:56.840
I would get to kill him.

38:58.147 --> 39:00.130
Sealed it with a kiss, remember?

39:01.270 --> 39:03.059
Don't you get it?

39:03.278 --> 39:05.953
As long as the Court is out there,

39:06.119 --> 39:09.080
I'll never be in control!

39:11.299 --> 39:13.791
Don't you mean we'll
never be in control?

39:22.316 --> 39:24.950
Seen it a thousand times.

39:25.270 --> 39:27.814
Ambition, power.

39:28.252 --> 39:29.743
People can't help themselves.

39:30.236 --> 39:32.252
She's changed, baby.

39:32.525 --> 39:33.994
When are you gonna see that?

39:34.106 --> 39:36.041
Shut up, Butch!

39:36.318 --> 39:37.551
Move!

39:39.522 --> 39:41.404
This is trouble.

39:47.563 --> 39:48.888
It's good to be home.

39:48.913 --> 39:52.763
FYI, I've been to Wayne Manor.
It's way cleaner.

39:53.469 --> 39:56.136
You never said anything about
Fries being a part of this.

39:56.585 --> 39:58.355
You're a little hot.

39:58.410 --> 39:59.722
Maybe you need to cool off.

39:59.808 --> 40:01.333
Oh, come on, you guys.

40:01.402 --> 40:03.644
We're on the same team now, remember?

40:04.647 --> 40:06.793
A family?

40:09.385 --> 40:10.884
Keep him away from me.

40:18.024 --> 40:20.852
There's a question mark on your face.

40:21.548 --> 40:23.582
You can sleep in the freezer.

40:24.059 --> 40:27.768
<i>The study speculates that widespread
chemical dumping is to blame.</i>

40:27.822 --> 40:30.438
<i>And this just in:
we now go to breaking news...</i>

40:30.463 --> 40:34.326
- Hey, Pengy. Check it out.
- Do not call me "Pengy"!

40:34.351 --> 40:36.139
- My...
- <i>The Riddler, aka Edward Nygma,</i>

40:36.164 --> 40:38.065
<i>was apprehended by the GCPD</i>

40:38.090 --> 40:41.926
<i>this afternoon after kidnapping
Interim Mayor Aubrey James.</i>

40:42.043 --> 40:44.550
<i>However, while en route
to Arkham Asylum, he managed</i>

40:44.575 --> 40:46.683
- <i>to escape police custody...</i>
- Riddler.

40:46.708 --> 40:48.120
<i>...and is now at large.</i>

40:48.145 --> 40:50.257
How long did he have
to think about that one?

40:53.269 --> 40:54.728
<i>Once the right hand</i>

40:54.763 --> 40:56.840
<i>to former mayor Oswald Kap...</i>

40:58.082 --> 40:59.855
Rest up, everyone.

41:00.640 --> 41:04.359
Tomorrow is going to be a busy day.

42:05.801 --> 42:08.468
I'd like to introduce our newest member,

42:08.754 --> 42:10.887
James Gordon.

42:23.515 --> 42:26.712
Welcome to the Court of Owls.
