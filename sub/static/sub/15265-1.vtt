01:34.427 --> 01:36.512
You ever seen a ghost?

01:40.725 --> 01:45.354
There's this guy,
comes in here every May 1st.

01:46.397 --> 01:49.441
Every May 1st, every December 1st.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.778
Like clockwork.

01:55.865 --> 02:00.744
What's he want?
Well, frankly, I ain't exactly sure.

02:04.124 --> 02:06.917
He had the strangest story to tell.

02:11.506 --> 02:14.508
He left this here, and I keep it for him.

02:19.430 --> 02:21.598
How do I know he'll be back?

02:28.431 --> 02:32.183
What's that? A woman was involved?

02:36.197 --> 02:39.074
Mmm. Just fits.

02:42.120 --> 02:44.538
I was married once myself.

02:56.259 --> 02:59.011
Hmm. Beautiful girl.

03:00.513 --> 03:05.058
And by the way, I'm Jim Daugherty.
I run the place.

03:05.518 --> 03:08.061
His name? Sure.

03:08.730 --> 03:11.565
His name is Jack Grimaldi.

03:12.483 --> 03:14.735
Hey, there he is now.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.620
Jack was a romantic guy.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.108
Big dreams.

03:28.208 --> 03:32.654
Problem was, there was always
a little daylight between his dreams

03:32.754 --> 03:38.032
and his wallet.
See, he was a working stiff.

03:38.134 --> 03:39.160
Hey, Billy.

03:39.260 --> 03:43.790
Fifty-six grand a year
and never made it past sergeant.

03:43.890 --> 03:47.267
And every day,
he looked at a little of this,

03:52.815 --> 03:55.651
and then he looked at too much of that.

03:57.820 --> 04:01.558
And all the time, he was thinkin'...

04:03.076 --> 04:06.662
I bet you know
what he was thinkin', don't ya?

04:07.372 --> 04:10.624
You'd have done just what
he wound up doing, I'll bet.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.655
Honey, I'm home.

04:15.755 --> 04:18.714
He walked around, just like anybody.

04:20.385 --> 04:24.388
But inside, he wasn't like anybody.

04:25.807 --> 04:30.018
'Cause he was doin' somethin'
about those big dreams.

04:30.728 --> 04:34.439
Something only
your true love would understand.

04:40.446 --> 04:44.199
Something you'd whisper to her
in the middle of the night

04:45.952 --> 04:48.203
and then hold her tight.

04:52.875 --> 04:55.210
That's the way it used to be with them.

05:00.800 --> 05:03.885
He could've told her anything.

05:11.519 --> 05:13.478
Hey! Hey, wait a minute!

05:14.564 --> 05:17.133
I'm getting a little ahead of myself here.

05:18.735 --> 05:24.239
Pretend you didn't see that.
Now, where was I? Oh, yeah.

05:26.200 --> 05:30.412
Anyway, his little plan was workin'.

05:32.415 --> 05:34.958
He was doin' great

05:36.919 --> 05:40.005
until the day things started to go wrong.

05:41.924 --> 05:46.595
See, he was watching the feds
hiding a mobster.

05:47.513 --> 05:51.016
A guy named Nick Gazzara.

05:51.267 --> 05:55.979
And tomorrow, Nick was supposed
to testify against the Mob.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.934
So we put Tommy and Louie in the trunk,

06:08.034 --> 06:10.353
and we drive it over
to Hunt's Point Market.

06:10.453 --> 06:13.356
You know, where the dump is over there?

06:13.456 --> 06:16.943
So Ray says to me "Let's burn them."

06:17.043 --> 06:20.113
I says, "Here?"
He says, "Yeah." I say, "Okay."

06:20.213 --> 06:24.909
So we go to take Lou out of the trunk,
because he was bleeding all over,

06:25.009 --> 06:28.538
and all we had was this,
like, shower curtain thing. It was a mess.

06:28.638 --> 06:32.292
So anyway, just as we're
about to take him out...

06:35.853 --> 06:39.731
Lou makes this little move
like he's still alive. Hmm?

06:41.275 --> 06:43.761
So this makes Ray go crazy, right?

06:43.861 --> 06:47.473
And he starts chopping at him
and chopping at him and chopping at him.

06:47.573 --> 06:51.451
And he's calling him all kinds of names.
He's calling him a bastard...

06:52.161 --> 06:53.730
This is very good. You wanna taste it?

06:53.830 --> 06:55.023
- No, thanks.
- Okay.

06:55.123 --> 06:58.509
So finally, we take Lou out of the trunk,

06:58.609 --> 07:02.670
and Ray pours gasoline
all over him and he sets him on fire.

07:03.256 --> 07:06.784
So Ray turns to me, real happy-like.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.954
He was a crazy son of a bitch.
I miss him. I really do.

07:10.054 --> 07:12.415
And he's got this real
happy look on his face.

07:12.515 --> 07:16.960
And he says to me,
"Don't Lou make a nice fire?"

07:18.771 --> 07:21.174
Don't Lou make a nice
fire?" That kills me.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.426
We parked the car over at La Guardia.

07:23.526 --> 07:27.630
In a week, they still hadn't found him.
Stank like a motherfucker!

07:38.416 --> 07:43.488
Gazzara's at the Monte Carlo, room 515.

07:43.588 --> 07:48.884
Plaza post office, box 1740. Paid in full.

07:51.554 --> 07:57.809
A quarter goes into a phone booth,
and 65,000 comes out.

07:59.562 --> 08:03.549
Could you ask for better odds at Vegas?

08:03.649 --> 08:04.816
Thank you.

08:09.405 --> 08:13.909
Now, tell me who you are.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.206
Marilyn Monroe.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.751
It's too corny.

08:25.546 --> 08:28.241
All right. I'm Madam Curie.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.467
And what did Madam Curie do?

08:32.595 --> 08:37.265
I forgot. Jack, you were supposed
to take me away for the weekend.

08:38.058 --> 08:41.436
I was in court. Try again.

08:42.145 --> 08:46.316
All right. I'm one of them girls
in a Budweiser commercial.

08:47.944 --> 08:54.699
You know,
with the big, soft, round, creamy tits.

08:56.536 --> 08:59.579
And long tanned legs.

09:01.290 --> 09:03.083
Who am I?

09:05.044 --> 09:08.004
I had a dream about you last night, Jack.

09:09.382 --> 09:10.766
What did you dream?

09:10.951 --> 09:13.202
Hey, Sheri, let's go! It's nuts out here.

09:13.302 --> 09:16.096
I'm still on my break! Fuck off!

09:20.643 --> 09:22.962
I dreamed you had a wife.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.815
Yeah? And what did she look like?

09:29.860 --> 09:31.319
Me.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.657
Who am I?

09:37.451 --> 09:39.661
Paul Newman.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.080
In what movie?

09:43.666 --> 09:44.833
Hud.

09:48.170 --> 09:49.671
You never saw Hud.

09:50.881 --> 09:54.160
So? I know what happened in it,

09:54.260 --> 09:57.705
and I know that he was
the prettiest thing there ever was.

09:57.805 --> 09:59.097
Come on.

10:03.811 --> 10:09.133
Jack, you know what the best part
about making it with a cop is?

10:09.233 --> 10:10.301
What?

10:10.401 --> 10:12.553
- You got two guns.
- Huh?

10:12.653 --> 10:15.056
One for me, and one for them.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.364
Yeah?

10:18.534 --> 10:23.272
Jack, when I'm walkin'
down the street, you know,

10:23.372 --> 10:27.709
and all them guys are lookin' at me,

10:28.044 --> 10:32.365
and I always think to myself
"You guys are assholes."

10:32.465 --> 10:35.634
'Cause no matter what they got,
my guy's got better.

10:52.485 --> 10:57.405
You know, like they say, a man
don't always do what's best for him.

11:01.410 --> 11:04.188
Sometimes he does the worst,

11:04.288 --> 11:06.983
he listens to a voice in his head.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.417
But what do you know? Too late.

11:09.877 --> 11:12.587
He finds out it's the wrong voice.

11:13.422 --> 11:17.994
That's what love can do to ya.
That's what it did to him.

11:18.094 --> 11:19.511
Oh, Jack.

11:23.224 --> 11:26.335
Jack. Oh, Jack.

11:26.435 --> 11:30.464
What else did she say?
Huh? You fuckin' Romeo.

11:30.564 --> 11:32.916
How come nobody loves me like that?

11:33.609 --> 11:38.556
I don't know. I don't know.
What are you doin' today?

11:38.656 --> 11:43.060
I'm gonna follow Frank Malacci out
to Aqueduct, like yesterday and last week.

11:43.160 --> 11:45.896
He's gonna meet with nobody
and do nothin' wrong.

11:45.996 --> 11:48.623
And I'm gonna go home, and tomorrow,

11:49.625 --> 11:51.793
I'm gonna do the same thing.

11:52.294 --> 11:54.295
Last night, I got fed up.

11:54.672 --> 11:56.407
Me and Joey wired the guy.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.326
What'd you get?

11:58.426 --> 12:00.760
You really wanna know, Sergeant?

12:01.011 --> 12:02.387
Here it is.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.459
11:00 pm. Malacci to Reilly,

12:06.559 --> 12:08.878
"Where do you wanna eat, Pat?"

12:08.978 --> 12:12.423
Reilly to Malacci, "I don't know, Frank.
Where do you wanna eat?"

12:12.523 --> 12:15.217
Malacci to Reilly,
"How about the Riviera?"

12:15.317 --> 12:20.113
Reilly to Malacci, "That place is full of shit.
How about the Paradise Diner?"

12:20.698 --> 12:22.266
"Oh, no."

12:22.366 --> 12:24.727
The feds want this guy?
This guy is a killer?

12:24.827 --> 12:27.871
This guy ain't a killer, Jack.
This guy is an eater.

12:28.497 --> 12:32.777
2:00 am. Malacci, "Let me stop by here
a minute. I wanna pick up some rolls."

12:32.877 --> 12:35.363
Reilly, "Hey, Frank,
try the place on the corner."

12:35.463 --> 12:37.964
Hey, hey, Lorraine. All right?

12:43.304 --> 12:45.414
Nick Gazzara got popped.

12:45.514 --> 12:48.042
Boom, boom.

12:48.142 --> 12:52.254
They think what's-her-face,
uh, that Russian bitch, Demarkov, did it.

12:52.354 --> 12:55.257
- What they got on it?
- Multiple murder. Adds that touch.

12:55.357 --> 12:57.927
Smell like a meat market Easter week.

12:58.027 --> 13:02.431
- Well, what do you want?
- Give me a sandwich. Somethin'.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.934
Feds ain't got Gazzara no more.

13:05.034 --> 13:06.602
They gotta make Demarkov talk.

13:06.702 --> 13:07.978
Yeah.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.189
Lorraine, you got somethin' for me?

13:10.289 --> 13:12.274
Yeah, Jack. This.

13:12.374 --> 13:14.902
Hey, how about we go out this weekend?

13:15.002 --> 13:16.904
Eddie wouldn't like it, Jack.

13:17.004 --> 13:22.868
I don't get it. Ever since I sent her husband
away, it's like she don't know me.

13:22.968 --> 13:25.913
- Where'd they get him?
- A hole-in-the-wall in Williamsburg.

13:26.013 --> 13:27.998
- Monte Carlo.
- That's right.

13:28.098 --> 13:30.459
They set him up with a new name,
the whole thing.

13:30.559 --> 13:32.920
They were shippin' him to Arizona.

13:33.020 --> 13:34.880
Phoenix. Holiday Diner.

13:34.980 --> 13:36.298
Red velour, right?

13:36.398 --> 13:38.551
Fuck him. He's better off dead.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.976
Those feds didn't come out too good.

13:47.076 --> 13:50.578
She sprayed the place. If you hadn't known,
you'd think it was a drug war.

13:59.713 --> 14:01.589
Shit.

14:02.508 --> 14:04.926
Just winged him. The fuck.

14:05.594 --> 14:06.594
So...

14:07.972 --> 14:10.306
It's in the box. Same as always.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.063
She took down that whole room.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.441
It's a new world, right?

14:21.610 --> 14:24.638
They were gonna wait
until he got out into the car.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.614
Well, she didn't wait.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.853
No way Nick was gonna make it
back to the stand again.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.815
Don Falcone on down, we're looking at life.
Ah, couldn't happen.

14:34.915 --> 14:36.692
There's gonna be a lot of heat.

14:36.792 --> 14:38.319
- So?
- So?

14:38.419 --> 14:40.628
So you made me a cop killer.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.464
A bullet's a bullet, Jack.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.244
Taking anybody else with him
wasn't the deal.

14:47.344 --> 14:50.080
Hey, what are you,
out of the business now or what?

14:50.180 --> 14:53.892
You wanna keep him safe,
just keep him at home, all right?

14:54.476 --> 14:55.727
Come on.

15:00.816 --> 15:06.347
So this girl, this Demarkov,
she's very modern.

15:06.447 --> 15:09.683
She doesn't give a fuck about nothin',
except for you-know-what.

15:09.783 --> 15:11.811
Falcone would've given it all to her, too.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.662
She wouldn't wait. Ah, too bad for her.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.234
How much time she lookin' at?

15:18.334 --> 15:20.668
That ain't the point, Jack.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.255
It's not her talkin' Falcone's scared of.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.284
She wants it all. You know the kind.

15:27.384 --> 15:31.179
You gotta take her out
before she takes him out. So...

15:33.724 --> 15:35.516
Want the job or not?

15:38.479 --> 15:40.005
What's the money like?

15:40.105 --> 15:41.356
Same as always.

15:44.234 --> 15:46.945
Nobody else gets hurt this time, huh?

15:50.282 --> 15:51.366
Yeah.

15:54.119 --> 15:55.370
Take it.

15:57.623 --> 16:00.192
Like the fall of Rome out there.

16:00.292 --> 16:03.920
Streets gonna be filled with animals.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.468
You keep breathing, huh? See ya next time.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.892
So, what? They playing with new rules now?

16:18.435 --> 16:20.061
More cops' blood?

16:20.479 --> 16:22.563
That was anybody's guess.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.067
He didn't wanna think about that.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.236
And he didn't.

16:35.244 --> 16:36.744
Shit.

16:37.037 --> 16:38.788
Come on.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.751
Fuck you!

16:48.382 --> 16:50.758
Sign here for Mona Demarkov.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.963
The job was to take her
over to the safe house

17:03.063 --> 17:05.647
and hand her ass over to the feds.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.946
And that voice in his head
said it was gonna be very easy.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.117
So you're the big hoodlum.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.747
Personally,

17:22.207 --> 17:23.790
I don't see it.

17:24.917 --> 17:26.419
Keep lookin'.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.040
Honeymoon rate?

17:38.140 --> 17:39.124
Short stay.

17:39.224 --> 17:42.143
Don't cry to me, pal. Just sign the book.

18:07.294 --> 18:09.003
Knock yourself out.

19:05.227 --> 19:07.228
It's not polite to stare.

19:19.575 --> 19:23.244
How'd you like to become
a rich man, Sergeant?

19:25.622 --> 19:28.541
Well, I've already got my health.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.477
You know what it feels like?

19:49.396 --> 19:52.315
I mean, when it's just sitting
in your hand.

19:55.402 --> 19:58.154
$200,000.

20:02.743 --> 20:06.120
You take the first bill
off the pile, a 20 or a 50...

20:08.415 --> 20:11.250
You're never gonna have
to pay taxes on it.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.382
Nothin' feels like that.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.678
Does it?

20:45.369 --> 20:48.746
What would you do with
all that money, Sergeant?

20:54.002 --> 20:56.420
It's better than sex, isn't it?

22:22.883 --> 22:25.259
Federal agents Cage and Skouras.

22:34.261 --> 22:35.779
Nice work, Sergeant.

22:51.703 --> 22:55.414
Well, I guess that
about says it all, don't it?

22:56.458 --> 22:59.919
He could hear her laughing
all the way down the hall.

23:00.337 --> 23:03.156
He wondered how smart she was.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.758
Smart enough to be on top, I guess.

23:06.426 --> 23:10.372
Well, he'd be the one laughing soon.

23:10.472 --> 23:14.141
So what? Romeo, did she confess?

23:40.001 --> 23:43.003
Yeah, she's at the Niagara, room 310.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.532
I left her there with the feds.

23:45.632 --> 23:48.884
And remember, Sal,
she's the only one who gets hit.

23:53.682 --> 23:55.015
Hey, Tony.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.932
You hungry?

24:38.727 --> 24:40.295
- Yeah.
- Hmm?

24:40.395 --> 24:41.562
Mmm-hmm.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.150
Come on.

24:58.079 --> 24:59.773
How was your day, baby?

24:59.873 --> 25:00.956
Fine.

25:02.083 --> 25:04.194
- Did the refrigerator guy come?
- Yeah.

25:04.294 --> 25:06.045
- How much?
- $86.

25:07.714 --> 25:08.824
How long was he here?

25:08.924 --> 25:11.926
Oh, about 15 minutes.

25:12.802 --> 25:17.014
What is that? That's five,
six hundred dollars a day or somethin'?

25:18.642 --> 25:22.170
Me? You know, I get kicked,
shot at, run over for what?

25:22.270 --> 25:23.463
42,000 and change.

25:23.563 --> 25:26.982
Here's a guy who makes $180,000
for changing a washer.

25:29.903 --> 25:32.613
You win. What is it?

25:34.157 --> 25:36.075
Chicken Francois, Jack.

25:41.248 --> 25:44.041
I wish you'd stop reading those magazines.

25:45.126 --> 25:47.753
Whatever happened to meat and potatoes?

25:54.886 --> 25:58.556
I don't know, Jack. You tell me.

26:22.956 --> 26:25.332
- That's cute.
- I got you.

26:29.087 --> 26:31.880
Here. I got you something.

26:33.883 --> 26:35.843
They got a new one.

26:39.180 --> 26:45.519
Okay, now, either I was really good,
Jack, or you were really bad.

26:51.359 --> 26:54.612
How come you never show me
those pictures you take?

26:55.280 --> 26:57.891
- Your sister called today.
- Mmm-hmm?

26:57.991 --> 27:00.659
Yeah. You know Marcy?

27:02.037 --> 27:04.371
I don't know nobody named Marcy.

27:06.833 --> 27:11.045
She's the nurse your sister works with
down at the hospital.

27:12.213 --> 27:16.050
She was caught giving
this doctor a blow job in the OR.

27:18.386 --> 27:20.721
He was taking out an appendix.

27:21.181 --> 27:25.293
Is that all you talk about? Huh?
God, you women are awful.

27:25.393 --> 27:27.144
Oh, really, Jack.

27:29.147 --> 27:30.689
And why's that?

27:31.232 --> 27:32.634
What did you say?

27:32.734 --> 27:34.068
You heard me.

27:41.618 --> 27:45.245
Jesus, Jack. You look like
you just been arrested.

27:46.581 --> 27:51.528
When I get good at this,
I thought I'd do weddings.

27:51.628 --> 27:54.281
- Weddings. You want weddings?
- Yeah.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.366
- You want weddings?
- Yeah.

27:56.466 --> 27:58.994
- You want weddings?
- Yeah.

27:59.094 --> 28:01.261
There's your honeymoon!

28:08.103 --> 28:11.006
Maybe it was just his imagination,

28:11.106 --> 28:16.235
but whenever he'd pull up
that plate, he'd hear a sucking sound.

28:17.612 --> 28:21.115
It started out small,
with the first 65 grand.

28:22.367 --> 28:27.371
And then it got bigger.
Pretty soon, it was the only thing he heard.

28:28.373 --> 28:32.084
Pretty soon, all he could think
about was feeding the hole.

28:33.461 --> 28:36.171
He didn't think about when he was a kid.

28:37.090 --> 28:40.327
He didn't think about
the guys who he started with,

28:40.427 --> 28:42.761
who were still on the up-and-up.

28:44.514 --> 28:47.891
He didn't think about the dreams
he had with Natalie.

28:50.562 --> 28:53.981
He didn't think
about those feds, lying there.

28:55.191 --> 28:59.319
Most of all, he didn't think
about Mona Demarkov

29:00.488 --> 29:04.199
because the way he saw it, she was done.

29:05.702 --> 29:08.579
Just another 65 grand meal for the hole.

29:09.414 --> 29:13.250
He'd fed the hole,
and he made the hole happy.

29:14.794 --> 29:17.880
It was the only thing
he knew how to make happy.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.349
Hey!

29:31.311 --> 29:32.561
Natalie!

29:37.233 --> 29:38.358
Hey!

29:43.865 --> 29:45.115
Natalie!

29:51.790 --> 29:53.040
Natalie!

29:58.254 --> 29:59.713
Hey, Natalie!

30:00.173 --> 30:03.884
That night, he had a terrible dream.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.016
The winner!

31:01.150 --> 31:02.860
A bad dream.

31:03.319 --> 31:06.613
Didn't mean nothin'.
Could've been something he ate.

31:07.198 --> 31:10.284
But after that, he couldn't sleep.

31:13.079 --> 31:17.791
Checked out the boys.
Thought he'd take his mind off things.

31:20.528 --> 31:22.054
What?

31:27.468 --> 31:31.388
This could be the night, boss.
He's headed for a heart attack.

31:35.810 --> 31:40.131
A guy with his blood pressure,
he goes in the saddle, end of problem.

31:40.231 --> 31:42.190
More of the same.

31:48.615 --> 31:52.659
Look at this guy. He should be
in a rest-home, not a threesome.

31:54.329 --> 31:58.998
Shit. What's he got
that old Jack ain't got?

32:44.671 --> 32:46.531
Coroner's office. Collins speaking.

32:46.631 --> 32:48.715
Hello, Stan. How you doin'?

32:49.133 --> 32:51.286
- It's Jack.
- I'm broke.

32:51.386 --> 32:55.180
Well, maybe you bet on
the wrong team or something. Listen...

32:55.473 --> 32:57.265
Yeah, do me a favor.

32:58.059 --> 33:00.978
You check the book?
Any new ones last night?

33:02.063 --> 33:04.507
A female. Homicide.

33:04.607 --> 33:07.302
Zip so far, boss. Anything else?

33:07.402 --> 33:10.471
Uh, no, thanks. I'll work it out.

33:10.571 --> 33:11.639
Yeah, sure.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.448
- Yeah.
- Bye.

33:34.095 --> 33:35.887
Is it hard yet, baby?

33:37.265 --> 33:38.932
It ain't easy.

33:39.642 --> 33:41.309
Yeah, I know.

33:47.316 --> 33:49.719
- Okay, what do you got?
- I got a pair.

33:49.819 --> 33:52.279
Three of a kind.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.140
Ace.

33:54.240 --> 33:57.560
Yeah? All right, hold on.

33:57.660 --> 33:59.604
Jack, pick it up over there.

33:59.704 --> 34:02.330
All right, everybody ante up, ante up.

34:04.417 --> 34:07.002
- Grimaldi.
- Downstairs. We gotta talk.

34:07.587 --> 34:08.862
Look, I'm busy...

34:08.963 --> 34:11.380
Hey, downstairs. Now.

34:37.283 --> 34:38.449
So?

34:41.161 --> 34:42.245
So?

34:45.291 --> 34:46.917
She wasn't there.

34:48.503 --> 34:51.670
Demarkov. She wasn't there, Jack.

34:53.674 --> 34:55.300
Falcone's upset.

34:56.010 --> 34:58.496
He wants to see you. Tomorrow.

34:58.596 --> 35:01.181
You'd better have something for him.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.350
What happened?

35:05.019 --> 35:06.686
I don't know.

35:07.688 --> 35:11.191
They think you're trying to
fuck with them, you know?

35:19.534 --> 35:21.034
I don't know.

35:23.204 --> 35:27.692
Jack, I already told him, this is done.
I mean, you gotta give me an address.

35:27.792 --> 35:30.319
You gotta give me something, all right?

35:30.419 --> 35:32.447
The old man thinks
you're holding out on him.

35:32.547 --> 35:37.551
Hey, you gotta give me something!
The fuck you lookin' at?

35:38.553 --> 35:41.122
You've forgotten
who the fuck you're dealing with?

35:41.222 --> 35:45.058
It's us. And you're in up to here. Okay?

35:45.977 --> 35:51.148
Now, there's a long walk.
If I take it, you take it too.

36:31.439 --> 36:34.941
Hey, Martie. Where you been?

36:37.278 --> 36:40.389
It was a thing for the feds.
They're movin' a witness.

36:40.489 --> 36:43.226
- Moving him where?
- How the fuck should I know?

36:43.326 --> 36:46.020
They think somebody's workin' both sides.

36:46.120 --> 36:48.689
I get up there, it's fuckin'
Mona Demarkov, man!

36:48.789 --> 36:52.026
- Why'd they move her?
- Hey, Jack, all right? Who knows?

36:52.126 --> 36:54.362
We're gettin' her in the car there, huh?

36:54.462 --> 36:56.405
Everything's goin' smooth, you know?

36:56.505 --> 37:00.800
Then all of the sudden,
from out of nowhere, she grabs my gun.

37:02.136 --> 37:05.164
I'm just one of the feds, you know,
who tries to peg her,

37:05.264 --> 37:09.544
but by then, she's making for the corner.
I couldn't believe it.

37:09.644 --> 37:12.229
Oh, fuck, Jack! She got my gun!

37:14.065 --> 37:16.483
Runnin' around with my gun, Jack.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.721
They'll take my shield
and put me back in a uniform.

37:20.821 --> 37:23.406
- What do they got on it?
- Nothin'.

37:24.617 --> 37:28.828
You know, she turned around
and pointed my own gun at me, Jack.

37:30.665 --> 37:33.568
She turned around
and she pointed my own gun at me, Jack!

37:33.668 --> 37:35.502
You know? Like some kind of an animal!

38:36.564 --> 38:38.633
Anything I could do to help, Sarge?

38:38.733 --> 38:39.899
Not a thing.

38:47.867 --> 38:50.228
Psychiatric report
on Agent Charles Stevens,

38:50.328 --> 38:53.898
FBI Eastern Field Office. June 1989.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.859
Stevens assigned to surveillance
of organized crime suspect,

38:56.959 --> 38:58.402
Mona Demarkov.

38:58.502 --> 39:01.864
Association to suspect Demarkov
with indicted Moscow crime family.

39:01.964 --> 39:06.577
An association with the Falcone crime
family confirmed October 1988.

39:06.677 --> 39:10.748
Revelation of criminal conspiracy
involving Demarkov and Stevens.

39:10.848 --> 39:14.585
Severe emotional disturbance
suffered by Agent Stevens after revelation.

39:14.685 --> 39:17.213
Escalating violent episodes,
hallucinations.

39:17.313 --> 39:21.676
December 1989, Agent Charles Stevens,
death by suicide.

39:21.776 --> 39:25.695
Criminal conspiracy charges
against suspect Demarkov dismissed.

41:38.370 --> 41:41.289
Look, you broke our deal.

41:42.791 --> 41:46.336
- How's that, Sergeant?
- I said nobody else gets hurt.

41:47.087 --> 41:48.823
You were paid, weren't you, Jack?

41:48.923 --> 41:50.757
Yeah. I said no cops!

41:52.635 --> 41:54.260
A life's a life.

41:55.095 --> 41:57.847
Moral distinctions can paralyze you.

41:59.975 --> 42:01.601
Something to eat?

42:05.272 --> 42:06.773
Come here.

42:13.781 --> 42:15.698
Altogether, what is it?

42:16.116 --> 42:21.079
Close to half a million dollars
over the course of our partnership?

42:24.959 --> 42:27.168
They must've moved her. Here.

42:28.087 --> 42:30.296
Just give me a couple of days.

42:31.966 --> 42:34.592
I don't want the money back, Sergeant.

42:35.427 --> 42:37.470
I want Mona Demarkov dead.

42:38.138 --> 42:41.391
I want you to find her,
and I want you to kill her.

42:43.310 --> 42:45.770
No, I won't do that.

42:50.776 --> 42:52.402
I won't kill her.

43:00.661 --> 43:01.828
Coffee?

43:12.172 --> 43:15.883
I don't suppose you're familiar
with the 20th-century poets.

43:16.677 --> 43:18.954
Robert Lowell was a pacifist.

43:19.054 --> 43:21.499
Mind you, I have no respect for pacifism.

43:21.599 --> 43:23.891
It's a morally bankrupt belief.

43:24.643 --> 43:28.214
Pacifists believe
that they have the right not to kill,

43:28.314 --> 43:31.357
but others always die
in defense of that right.

43:32.026 --> 43:34.345
Anyway, during the Second World War,

43:34.445 --> 43:38.432
Lowell was in prison for refusing
to serve in the armed forces.

43:38.532 --> 43:41.242
In the cell next to him was Louis Lepke.

43:42.369 --> 43:45.163
You're familiar with Murder Incorporated?

43:45.623 --> 43:49.042
- Yeah.
- Ah, so you're a reader, after all.

43:49.877 --> 43:52.321
One day, Lepke says to Lowell,

43:52.421 --> 43:56.174
"I'm here because I killed someone.
How about you?"

43:57.217 --> 44:00.803
Lowell replies,
"I'm here because I wouldn't kill anyone."

44:02.973 --> 44:04.641
You get the point?

44:08.854 --> 44:10.855
You like the money, Jack?

44:12.066 --> 44:13.608
- Yeah.
- So do I.

44:15.235 --> 44:17.779
We do what we do out of convenience.

44:18.947 --> 44:22.575
Does the end justify the means? Ask Lepke.

44:24.161 --> 44:27.372
Of course, he's dead. So is Lowell.

44:30.417 --> 44:33.127
Eventually, I'll be destroyed.

44:33.837 --> 44:37.548
The next generation of barbarians
are waiting to take over.

44:38.425 --> 44:41.219
Mona. People like that.

44:42.888 --> 44:45.499
It doesn't mean I have to
throw open the door.

44:45.599 --> 44:50.395
Now, you will do the job.
You will live your life.

44:51.897 --> 44:55.942
You know right from wrong.
You just don't care.

44:57.444 --> 45:00.530
And that's the most
natural thing in the world.

45:04.576 --> 45:08.939
I could have you shot, torn to pieces,

45:09.039 --> 45:13.751
your wife made ugly, your house
burned down, your girlfriend gutted.

45:14.294 --> 45:16.963
By noon Wednesday, I may authorize it.

45:18.632 --> 45:22.427
You see, you don't make the deals, Jack.
I make the deals.

45:23.554 --> 45:26.097
And you're in until I say otherwise.

45:33.439 --> 45:34.647
Well...

45:36.817 --> 45:42.488
We've said everything that needs
to be said, haven't we? Good day.

46:19.151 --> 46:22.028
He was between a rock and a hard place.

46:22.488 --> 46:23.780
Now what?

46:28.285 --> 46:30.312
What was he gonna do?

46:30.412 --> 46:33.873
He knew what he had to do
if he wanted that 65 grand.

46:35.000 --> 46:37.543
If he wanted to stay alive, that is.

46:39.046 --> 46:43.090
Stay alive. 65 grand. Feed the hole.

46:43.717 --> 46:47.496
Stay alive. 65 grand. Feed the hole.

46:47.596 --> 46:48.664
Jack...

46:48.764 --> 46:50.207
Sixty-five grand.

46:50.307 --> 46:53.794
- Jack?
- Feed the hole. 65 grand.

46:53.894 --> 46:55.421
Where's the funeral?

46:55.521 --> 46:57.021
Feed the hole.

46:57.439 --> 46:59.690
- What?
- Hey, Jack!

46:59.983 --> 47:01.317
Telephone.

47:17.960 --> 47:18.986
Yeah?

47:19.086 --> 47:21.087
Hello, Jack.

47:22.214 --> 47:23.297
Jack?

47:25.092 --> 47:26.160
Where are you?

47:26.260 --> 47:30.179
He wants you to kill me.
You've got till Wednesday, right?

47:32.516 --> 47:34.042
Right.

47:35.102 --> 47:38.696
I'm at the hotel. Our room.

48:04.089 --> 48:05.673
How've you been?

48:17.394 --> 48:19.061
A little bit busy.

48:20.188 --> 48:22.883
What have they offered you, Jack?

48:22.983 --> 48:25.109
What are you talkin' about?

48:26.069 --> 48:29.196
All I'm asking is
if Falcone's upped your price.

48:37.122 --> 48:38.440
Sixty-five.

48:38.540 --> 48:40.432
For me?

48:43.128 --> 48:45.671
That prick's livin' in the past.

48:49.676 --> 48:52.303
I'll up that five times.

48:59.686 --> 49:03.773
$325,000.

49:05.776 --> 49:08.027
Half now, half on delivery.

49:10.572 --> 49:12.432
- For what?
- You go to him.

49:12.532 --> 49:13.851
Tell him it's been done.

49:13.951 --> 49:15.102
What's been done?

49:15.202 --> 49:17.771
Tell me I'm already dead, Jack.

49:17.871 --> 49:20.607
Later on, we'll get ourselves a body.

49:20.707 --> 49:22.708
Until they do an autopsy.

49:24.878 --> 49:27.004
That's all the time I need.

49:31.218 --> 49:33.052
My money's no good?

49:34.304 --> 49:36.389
Your money's got more risk.

49:39.059 --> 49:40.935
More risk, more pay.

49:47.317 --> 49:49.944
The autopsy will confirm that it's me.

49:54.116 --> 49:56.450
And how's that gonna happen?

50:00.580 --> 50:04.583
You think you're the only person
in the world that's been bought?

50:16.096 --> 50:17.722
You got a girl?

50:18.724 --> 50:22.435
What is it? Cathy? Linda? Susan?

50:24.479 --> 50:25.730
Sheri.

50:26.231 --> 50:30.276
Cocktail waitress. Maloney's. Yeah?

50:33.405 --> 50:38.200
You take your money and your Sheri

50:39.661 --> 50:41.620
and you'll be a big guy.

50:42.873 --> 50:47.752
All I need is a couple of days to finish
my business and get out of the country.

50:50.047 --> 50:51.422
It's yours.

50:55.469 --> 50:56.969
It's all yours.

51:00.307 --> 51:02.433
All you gotta do is take it.

51:04.978 --> 51:08.646
Go on, Jack. Go on.

51:09.941 --> 51:12.151
All you gotta do is take it.

51:33.548 --> 51:37.551
Tuesday? The docks.

51:43.225 --> 51:44.767
The other half.

51:45.977 --> 51:47.728
Death certificate.

51:56.029 --> 52:00.074
It was that old voice in his head,
the wrong voice,

52:01.201 --> 52:04.537
that sucked his brain out,
spit it on the floor.

52:05.288 --> 52:09.208
He could've gone back,
begged Natalie to forgive him.

52:11.628 --> 52:13.254
But he didn't.

52:13.854 --> 52:17.106
Ah, that old voice.

52:26.810 --> 52:28.545
What are you doin'? Where are you goin'?

52:28.645 --> 52:31.730
I'm goin' to Florida.
My sister lives in Boca.

52:36.153 --> 52:37.820
You can't do that.

52:38.321 --> 52:40.239
Yeah, well, I am, Jack.

52:44.911 --> 52:48.455
I never fool around with married men,
unless I'm married.

52:49.082 --> 52:51.276
So maybe I'll go get married.

52:51.376 --> 52:54.837
And I'll come back,
and then I'll fool around with you.

52:57.257 --> 53:01.844
Or maybe I won't get married now,
and I'll just fool around with unmarried men.

53:02.012 --> 53:05.499
Or maybe something will just happen
that I don't know about.

53:05.599 --> 53:07.933
You know? You never know, right?

53:12.981 --> 53:14.607
I won't let you.

53:16.735 --> 53:17.818
Jack.

53:18.945 --> 53:21.447
Jack, wait a second. Wait.

53:24.743 --> 53:25.826
Um...

53:27.954 --> 53:29.580
I love you, Jack.

53:32.292 --> 53:36.128
And I even think you love me,
but you just don't know it yet.

53:38.673 --> 53:42.092
And I can't keep waitin'
for you to come around.

53:42.802 --> 53:46.305
Otherwise, I ain't gonna have a life left.

53:47.891 --> 53:49.141
You know?

53:59.736 --> 54:02.071
You're breakin' my heart, Sheri.

54:21.174 --> 54:24.134
Cardio pulmonary arrest.

54:26.137 --> 54:28.582
Penetrating gunshot wound.

54:28.682 --> 54:31.392
Exsanguination by internal hemorrhage.

54:33.728 --> 54:35.688
You mean she's dead?

54:37.357 --> 54:38.440
Yeah.

54:41.027 --> 54:43.529
Do you remember on our second date,

54:44.781 --> 54:48.951
when we went to the Rialto
and saw The Sound of Music and you cried?

54:50.203 --> 54:53.122
You cried. I never cry.

54:56.334 --> 54:57.944
You cried the day we got married.

54:58.044 --> 55:00.462
Who wouldn't cry, marryin' you?

55:04.884 --> 55:06.885
Let me ask you something.

55:17.063 --> 55:20.008
How come instead of gettin' better,
it got worse?

55:20.108 --> 55:22.234
What's "it"?

55:28.074 --> 55:32.020
I wish I had a million dollars.
Know what I'd do if I had a million dollars?

55:32.120 --> 55:34.163
Buy myself some happiness.

55:37.584 --> 55:39.877
You don't get it by being good.

55:43.798 --> 55:46.159
And you don't get it by being poor,

55:46.259 --> 55:50.179
and all those people
who said you don't get it by being rich...

55:55.143 --> 55:56.769
They were lyin'.

56:02.359 --> 56:04.052
What do you think?

56:04.152 --> 56:06.653
What is this, a new religion?

56:07.864 --> 56:10.616
I don't understand a word you're sayin'.

56:11.284 --> 56:13.285
Everything else runs out.

56:16.498 --> 56:18.290
You get tired of sex.

56:21.169 --> 56:22.836
Love doesn't last.

56:26.007 --> 56:30.219
You got both of them,
you worry about your health.

56:31.805 --> 56:34.473
If that's okay, you get scared of dyin'.

56:47.445 --> 56:50.155
You know what I used to like about you?

56:50.657 --> 56:52.616
You didn't used to talk.

56:54.369 --> 56:56.870
Was it my sister you screwed, Jack?

56:58.623 --> 57:00.249
Or just my niece?

57:25.900 --> 57:30.571
I don't know what you're doin', but
whatever it is, don't bring it back here.

57:36.619 --> 57:41.206
A time to be born, a time to die.

57:42.709 --> 57:46.879
A time to plant, a time to harvest.

57:47.714 --> 57:52.050
A time to destroy, a time to rebuild.

57:53.052 --> 57:55.053
A time to cry.

57:55.430 --> 58:00.794
Heavenly Father, you take
your beloved child, Nicholas Gazzara,

58:00.894 --> 58:03.505
beloved husband of Rosemary Gazzara,

58:03.605 --> 58:07.399
father of Frederico, Paulo and Estelle.

58:08.234 --> 58:11.904
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

58:12.572 --> 58:17.644
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

58:17.744 --> 58:20.271
That's a legend bein'
put in that hole, Joey.

58:20.371 --> 58:23.749
Yeah, plant the prick.
Let's get the hell outta here.

58:26.252 --> 58:28.378
Let's get somethin' to eat.

58:36.262 --> 58:38.055
You all right, Jack?

58:38.806 --> 58:43.185
I ain't feelin' too good.
You go on with Scully and Joey.

58:59.118 --> 59:00.702
Moving ceremony.

59:03.164 --> 59:04.289
Yeah.

59:05.792 --> 59:07.417
Life is fleeting.

59:09.045 --> 59:10.963
Take him to that tree.

59:12.131 --> 59:16.703
You said Wednesday.
I'm meetin' her tomorrow. I'll get her then!

59:16.803 --> 59:18.470
Which is it, Jack?

59:18.972 --> 59:21.249
Toes, take two.

59:21.349 --> 59:23.376
You said Wednesday!

59:23.476 --> 59:25.462
Take one, I'll get the rest tomorrow.

59:25.562 --> 59:27.771
No! Listen!

59:29.232 --> 59:31.316
Wait a minute...

59:37.156 --> 59:38.824
Goodbye, Jack.

59:46.249 --> 59:49.861
Natalie, get a suitcase.
Go upstairs, get dressed!

59:49.961 --> 59:51.404
- Jack?
- I fucked up!

59:51.504 --> 59:53.589
What happened?

59:54.382 --> 59:56.216
I stole some money!

01:00:00.847 --> 01:00:05.517
There's $350,000 here. It's ours!
It's free money, Natalie!

01:00:07.478 --> 01:00:10.689
Now, you go somewhere...
Out west, Phoenix.

01:00:12.692 --> 01:00:14.943
Nat... Nat...

01:00:16.237 --> 01:00:19.265
I took... I...

01:00:19.365 --> 01:00:23.910
I played both sides against the middle.
I got caught. I'm sorry.

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:27.122
Take the money. It's yours.

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:32.794
You settle somewhere...
Arizona, New Mexico.

01:00:34.505 --> 01:00:37.742
Get yourself a job. Nothin' fancy.

01:00:37.842 --> 01:00:40.578
You know, like a waitress or something.

01:00:40.678 --> 01:00:42.596
Use your maiden name.

01:00:43.389 --> 01:00:46.224
Don't bank the cash. Keep it handy.

01:00:48.061 --> 01:00:50.312
Meet me May 1st.

01:00:50.730 --> 01:00:52.814
That's a year, Jack.

01:00:52.914 --> 01:00:54.342
That's a year!

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:57.011
I'll get you a new place.
Some place real nice...

01:00:57.111 --> 01:00:59.764
It's a fuckin' year, Jack!

01:00:59.864 --> 01:01:03.075
I promise! Fill it full of stuff you like!

01:01:06.329 --> 01:01:08.997
Phoenix, the Holiday Diner.

01:01:09.916 --> 01:01:12.125
It's off the interstate. Here.

01:01:18.633 --> 01:01:19.925
Route 10.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:25.097
What if you're not there?

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:30.352
Try every six months.
May 1st, December 1st.

01:01:30.603 --> 01:01:32.479
May 1st, December 1st.

01:01:36.150 --> 01:01:37.818
Will you be there?

01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:41.446
We're married, aren't we?

01:01:47.620 --> 01:01:49.287
That's no answer.

01:01:52.959 --> 01:01:54.292
I'm sorry.

01:01:56.671 --> 01:01:59.631
I'm sorry. I do love you.

01:02:01.384 --> 01:02:02.718
I'm sorry.

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:07.931
I can't, uh...

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:17.441
I can't live without you, Natalie.

01:02:19.485 --> 01:02:21.153
Don't leave me.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:27.117
I just wanna be sure that you'll be there.

01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:32.080
I left you something at home
so you'll know for sure. It's in the...

01:02:33.958 --> 01:02:36.585
It's in the bureau in the top drawer.

01:02:41.632 --> 01:02:44.243
I promise, I'll do anything.

01:02:44.343 --> 01:02:46.344
I love you anyway, Jackie.

01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:58.648
Hey.

01:03:07.116 --> 01:03:08.992
See ya when I see ya.

01:03:22.256 --> 01:03:24.049
I'll do anything.

01:03:24.383 --> 01:03:26.301
Do what, exactly?

01:03:29.555 --> 01:03:32.557
Can I tell you
what makes love so frightening?

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:35.894
It's that you don't own it.

01:03:36.979 --> 01:03:38.396
It owns you.

01:03:53.412 --> 01:03:55.747
Why don't you just say it, Jack?

01:04:00.002 --> 01:04:01.461
Say it, Jack.

01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:05.966
It's over.

01:04:06.801 --> 01:04:11.304
And you're sorry, right?
You're so fuckin' sorry.

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:57.017
Dear Natalie, I'm sorry.

01:04:58.936 --> 01:05:03.148
Like I told you at the airport,
I mean that.

01:05:04.817 --> 01:05:07.402
You're the sweetest thing I ever had.

01:05:08.946 --> 01:05:12.157
Please, Nat, don't give up on me.

01:05:13.492 --> 01:05:17.996
I'm so sorry.
I keep makin' the same mistakes.

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:23.209
But, everything's gonna
be different from now on.

01:05:24.503 --> 01:05:25.837
I promise.

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:31.244
I just need a little time
to settle a couple of things here,

01:05:31.344 --> 01:05:34.679
and then we're gonna
be back together. You know, Nat?

01:05:35.723 --> 01:05:38.751
I was thinkin' the other day

01:05:38.851 --> 01:05:42.020
about you wantin'
one of those new gas barbecues.

01:05:43.022 --> 01:05:48.386
I saw one this mornin'
and I put a little deposit on it.

01:05:48.486 --> 01:05:51.404
You know, right?
Hey, we'll take it with us.

01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:54.407
Ditto for the furniture.

01:05:55.242 --> 01:05:57.535
We're gonna need all new stuff.

01:05:59.038 --> 01:06:00.747
Wait. You'll see.

01:06:01.207 --> 01:06:03.500
It's gonna be just like I said.

01:06:05.127 --> 01:06:10.340
And remember, May 1st, December 1st.

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:13.301
You'll see.

01:06:15.721 --> 01:06:16.805
Jack.

01:07:18.826 --> 01:07:21.562
He loves those toes, doesn't he?

01:07:21.662 --> 01:07:23.288
The money!

01:07:46.395 --> 01:07:48.063
What did I die of?

01:07:48.773 --> 01:07:50.398
Haemopericardium.

01:07:52.818 --> 01:07:55.320
You took one in the chest.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:02.827
New ID card.

01:08:04.497 --> 01:08:06.164
Driver's license.

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:11.002
Wanna count it?

01:08:19.011 --> 01:08:20.511
You ever been in love?

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:29.395
I'm just askin'.

01:12:40.439 --> 01:12:42.675
I don't remember.

01:12:42.775 --> 01:12:45.761
Next it was that voice in my head.
It was driving me nuts.

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:48.696
- She's gone.
- She was gone. I...

01:12:50.324 --> 01:12:51.892
She's got the money. Where was the money?

01:12:51.992 --> 01:12:53.602
But it ain't the money, is it?

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:56.996
It wasn't the money.
It was something else.

01:13:09.301 --> 01:13:13.763
They'd torn up the place.
Done a good job. Get in, get out.

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:25.358
Hear that? Those fuckin' bells.

01:13:26.235 --> 01:13:29.529
You need some time.
You're not thinkin' right.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:33.225
- You need to relax.
- I needed to relax.

01:13:33.325 --> 01:13:35.894
- You can't go back home.
- I couldn't go back home.

01:13:35.994 --> 01:13:40.899
You gotta stay away from the usual places.
Sleep in the car.

01:13:40.999 --> 01:13:43.251
Yeah, sleep in the car.

01:13:44.962 --> 01:13:46.071
Hello, Norm?

01:13:46.171 --> 01:13:47.573
You've been sick...

01:13:47.673 --> 01:13:50.576
Nah, I've just been sick.

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:52.077
It ain't serious...

01:13:52.177 --> 01:13:55.289
Nah, it ain't serious.

01:13:55.389 --> 01:13:57.750
- What about her?
- Demarkov?

01:13:57.850 --> 01:13:59.668
The bitch is gone, boss.

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:02.270
She must be all the way
to Buenos Aires by now.

01:14:14.074 --> 01:14:16.560
I tried to stop thinkin'.

01:14:16.660 --> 01:14:19.104
Tried to get my head straight.

01:14:19.204 --> 01:14:22.399
If I could just get my head straight,

01:14:22.499 --> 01:14:25.001
then everything would be all right.

01:14:25.794 --> 01:14:30.047
I slept in the car.
I stayed away from the usual places.

01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:36.596
Something was eatin' at me.
Where was Sal in all of this?

01:14:37.222 --> 01:14:41.893
Who was payin' his rent?
I had no fuckin' idea.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:46.814
I tracked him, thinkin' I could
figure a way to stop all this.

01:14:47.441 --> 01:14:51.402
But inside, I knew there
was only one way to stop it.

01:14:51.778 --> 01:14:54.572
And when she showed...

01:14:55.115 --> 01:14:57.325
I almost could've called it.

01:14:57.576 --> 01:15:03.456
Like I used to say, whoever you shoot,
you may as well marry 'em,

01:15:04.583 --> 01:15:07.528
'cause you're tied to 'em for life,

01:15:07.628 --> 01:15:12.173
till the end of their life
or the end of yours.

01:15:28.732 --> 01:15:31.609
Fuck! Shit!

01:19:35.353 --> 01:19:39.216
Hey, buddy! Come on, get outta here!

01:19:39.316 --> 01:19:41.525
Hey. Don't make me call a cop.

01:20:06.218 --> 01:20:08.010
Give me some Tylenol.

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:43.379
Let's go!

01:20:45.966 --> 01:20:47.967
Go around the other side!

01:21:03.316 --> 01:21:06.443
- Get outta the way.
- Get back.

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:21.917
Hmm.

01:21:55.619 --> 01:21:56.952
I love summer.

01:22:19.476 --> 01:22:21.602
Did you miss me, sweetheart?

01:22:26.691 --> 01:22:28.359
Don't worry, Jack.

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:35.991
I'm not angry at you.

01:22:39.913 --> 01:22:41.538
You'll let me go?

01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:44.416
I didn't say that.

01:22:45.919 --> 01:22:47.711
You're a murderer.

01:23:00.392 --> 01:23:02.559
Wanna buy yourself some time?

01:23:35.093 --> 01:23:36.677
With or without?

01:23:40.348 --> 01:23:41.598
Without.

01:24:09.961 --> 01:24:12.463
I was 16. What did I know?

01:24:13.548 --> 01:24:18.052
I wanted to, you understand.
He was young too.

01:24:18.553 --> 01:24:20.372
The hardest part was getting
a place alone.

01:24:20.472 --> 01:24:22.457
You know what it's like when you're 16.

01:24:22.557 --> 01:24:24.751
Everybody always lookin' at you.

01:24:24.851 --> 01:24:28.964
20 years later, you wish they were
lookin' at you again, but, hey,

01:24:29.064 --> 01:24:30.481
that's life.

01:24:31.107 --> 01:24:35.319
- Yeah.
- So, we finally went off by ourselves,

01:24:36.488 --> 01:24:39.891
down to the beach,
one of those lifeguard chairs.

01:24:39.991 --> 01:24:43.228
Middle of the winter.
You know you're crazy when you're a kid.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:49.124
It was freezing in that chair.
But it was nice. Quiet.

01:24:58.343 --> 01:25:00.094
Later on, I just...

01:25:02.472 --> 01:25:05.682
I... just left him there.

01:25:08.186 --> 01:25:09.937
I closed his eyes,

01:25:12.232 --> 01:25:14.274
climbed out and went home.

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:21.365
They were beautiful blue eyes.

01:25:27.872 --> 01:25:29.248
Like yours.

01:25:43.012 --> 01:25:44.346
I guess,

01:25:45.431 --> 01:25:47.766
you never forget the first time.

01:25:53.898 --> 01:25:55.774
Okay, let's get him out.

01:25:59.070 --> 01:26:00.737
Let's get who out?

01:26:03.449 --> 01:26:04.533
Who?

01:26:11.416 --> 01:26:13.834
Jack? Jack!

01:26:17.589 --> 01:26:19.381
What are you doing?

01:26:19.924 --> 01:26:21.717
We're gonna bury him.

01:26:22.802 --> 01:26:25.512
Right there, deep. Dig.

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:37.274
Mona,

01:26:39.777 --> 01:26:41.179
don't ask me to kill him.

01:26:41.279 --> 01:26:44.307
I don't want you to kill him.
I just want you to bury him.

01:26:44.407 --> 01:26:48.202
If he dies in the process,
that's his problem.

01:26:48.953 --> 01:26:50.954
Whoa. No.

01:26:51.414 --> 01:26:55.751
You settle us both right now,
you walk away a free man.

01:27:03.343 --> 01:27:05.536
You can dig one grave...

01:27:08.473 --> 01:27:10.265
Or you can dig two.

01:27:15.146 --> 01:27:17.048
It's hard diggin' a grave

01:27:17.148 --> 01:27:20.525
when the guy it's for
is starin' straight at you.

01:27:21.569 --> 01:27:24.404
But I kept thinkin', this was it.

01:27:25.615 --> 01:27:29.034
When he was gone, all this'd be over.

01:27:31.162 --> 01:27:35.332
Dear Natalie,
I hope this letter finds you well.

01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:39.904
I guess you've guessed that my joining you
has been delayed a little bit.

01:27:40.004 --> 01:27:44.576
I'm still coming, right after
I finish taking care of this thing.

01:27:44.676 --> 01:27:46.260
I gotta finish.

01:27:47.595 --> 01:27:49.805
You know what we're gonna do?

01:27:50.265 --> 01:27:54.351
We're gonna find a little place,
maybe up the mountains.

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:58.730
I've been looking
into finding us this place on this lake.

01:27:59.691 --> 01:28:03.610
I've been making a few calls,
checking into a couple of places.

01:28:06.281 --> 01:28:07.823
Here?

01:28:09.033 --> 01:28:10.367
In a hole?

01:28:15.373 --> 01:28:16.790
In Brooklyn?

01:28:18.084 --> 01:28:22.530
It wasn't so far from here
I first took you in.

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:25.450
What's life without good friends?

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:27.801
We could've shared everything.

01:28:29.887 --> 01:28:31.096
We did.

01:28:44.777 --> 01:28:47.388
Anyway, Nat, like I said,

01:28:47.488 --> 01:28:51.825
I've been looking into these places,
places I think you'd like.

01:28:52.827 --> 01:28:57.607
I think I found the perfect spot.
Blue skies every day.

01:28:57.707 --> 01:29:00.151
You could smell eucalyptus
trees everywhere.

01:29:00.251 --> 01:29:03.920
It's paradise.
Just like we always dreamed about.

01:29:05.089 --> 01:29:07.325
And don't forget what I told you.

01:29:07.425 --> 01:29:12.095
Phoenix, Holiday Diner.
May 1st, December 1st.

01:29:14.265 --> 01:29:15.932
It'll be heaven.

01:29:19.771 --> 01:29:23.315
Congratulations, Jack. You're a free man.

01:29:34.869 --> 01:29:37.662
You ever wonder what hell is like?

01:29:38.581 --> 01:29:41.083
Maybe it ain't the place you think.

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:43.794
Fire and brimstone?

01:29:44.337 --> 01:29:47.923
Devil with horns poking you
in the butt with a pitchfork?

01:29:49.634 --> 01:29:51.009
What's hell?

01:29:51.803 --> 01:29:55.764
The time you should've walked,
but you didn't.

01:29:57.141 --> 01:29:58.517
That's hell.

01:30:02.438 --> 01:30:04.147
You're lookin' at it.

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:27.003
Goodbye.

01:30:28.673 --> 01:30:29.798
Jack.

01:30:35.805 --> 01:30:37.305
Come on, Jack.

01:30:41.811 --> 01:30:43.562
Just one last dance.

01:30:53.531 --> 01:30:54.656
Yeah.

01:30:57.743 --> 01:30:58.869
Sure.

01:31:03.416 --> 01:31:04.666
Why not?

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:39.826
Jesus, Jack! I'm sorry.

01:31:41.037 --> 01:31:42.480
You're under arrest.

01:31:42.580 --> 01:31:44.956
Careful. He's got a gun.

01:31:58.304 --> 01:32:01.374
Jack, you have the right to remain silent.

01:32:01.474 --> 01:32:02.959
Anything you say will be held...

01:32:03.059 --> 01:32:04.726
Are you kiddin'?

01:32:09.065 --> 01:32:11.358
All right, take it easy on him.

01:32:12.109 --> 01:32:15.987
Here's a letter from Martie and us.

01:32:22.787 --> 01:32:24.329
What? Sorry.

01:32:25.164 --> 01:32:27.332
"Dear Jack, what a pisser.

01:32:28.042 --> 01:32:31.112
"Here we are,
fighting the bullshit for 15 years,

01:32:31.212 --> 01:32:34.198
"and now we find out that
you're part of the bullshit.

01:32:34.298 --> 01:32:38.327
"What can we tell you?
You broke our hearts, you dumbest of fucks.

01:32:38.427 --> 01:32:40.512
"And we mean that sincerely.

01:32:41.931 --> 01:32:43.181
"The boys."

01:32:50.314 --> 01:32:52.357
The Monte Carlo?

01:33:00.533 --> 01:33:02.576
Party's over, Jack.

01:33:03.995 --> 01:33:05.537
Nice place.

01:33:06.414 --> 01:33:08.290
You know what I think?

01:33:10.334 --> 01:33:12.987
I think she's gonna kill you right here.

01:33:14.130 --> 01:33:16.949
You know what she's doin' right now, Jack?

01:33:17.049 --> 01:33:20.578
She's downtown
cuttin' herself the deal of the century.

01:33:20.678 --> 01:33:24.514
She's gonna walk away scot-free.
Leave you to pay for it all.

01:33:26.392 --> 01:33:30.186
Next week at this time,
you're gonna be nothin' but a memory.

01:33:32.523 --> 01:33:34.107
If I were you,

01:33:36.444 --> 01:33:38.069
I'd cut that deal first.

01:33:47.371 --> 01:33:51.275
And in return for
Sergeant Grimaldi's cooperation,

01:33:51.375 --> 01:33:55.446
he'll be expecting standard protection
taken for his own personal safety,

01:33:55.546 --> 01:33:59.090
the procurement of a new identity

01:34:00.468 --> 01:34:03.011
and relocation if necessary.

01:34:18.486 --> 01:34:21.180
Congratulations, Mona. Like they say,

01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:24.770
never underestimate
the value of cooperation.

01:34:28.537 --> 01:34:30.830
What'd she do, fuck the judge?

01:34:31.207 --> 01:34:32.984
It's all right, sir. Let him go.

01:34:33.084 --> 01:34:34.376
Okay. All right.

01:34:37.588 --> 01:34:39.156
You think you can get away with this?

01:34:39.256 --> 01:34:40.366
They're slow, Jack.

01:34:40.466 --> 01:34:44.161
They're fat and they're slow,
and I'm hungry.

01:34:44.261 --> 01:34:46.971
I made the Don and now the Don is dead.

01:34:47.765 --> 01:34:50.266
- Some dog'll dig him up.
- Next week.

01:34:51.268 --> 01:34:53.921
I never liked you, Jack. You're filth.

01:34:54.021 --> 01:34:57.842
Not even when I screwed you,
you poor, stupid fuck.

01:34:57.942 --> 01:34:59.567
It made me sick.

01:35:00.361 --> 01:35:01.596
- You went crazy.
- Never.

01:35:01.696 --> 01:35:03.598
- You said you did.
- I lied.

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:06.533
You never got to me. Not for a minute.

01:35:07.785 --> 01:35:10.704
You're a dry fuck, Jack.
That's what you are.

01:35:12.873 --> 01:35:16.193
When I came, you know what
I was thinkin' about? My wife.

01:35:16.293 --> 01:35:20.422
Too bad, Jack, 'cause you're never gonna
get a chance to do it to her again.

01:35:21.215 --> 01:35:24.342
She's a dead woman,
just like you're a dead man.

01:35:37.022 --> 01:35:38.523
So long, Jack.

01:35:55.207 --> 01:35:56.499
Fuck!

01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:39.375
Jack! Easy! Easy!

01:36:45.341 --> 01:36:46.424
Jack.

01:36:48.302 --> 01:36:49.969
No! Hey, whoa.

01:37:49.154 --> 01:37:50.780
Well done, Jack.

01:37:52.908 --> 01:37:54.409
Good shooting.

01:37:54.952 --> 01:38:00.357
Well, in the end, things didn't
work out too badly for me after all.

01:38:00.457 --> 01:38:04.794
Did they?
They gave me the police combat cross,

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:10.242
"For his act of self-defense,
one of extraordinary heroism,

01:38:10.342 --> 01:38:13.537
"saving the lives of other officers."

01:38:13.637 --> 01:38:18.892
They gave me a new residence.
They gave me a new identity.

01:38:20.936 --> 01:38:22.437
Jim Daugherty.

01:38:25.733 --> 01:38:26.983
May 1st.

01:38:28.027 --> 01:38:30.695
That was five years ago to the day.

01:38:32.114 --> 01:38:35.392
I guess this is where I came in

01:38:35.492 --> 01:38:38.562
to tell you the story of an unlucky guy

01:38:38.662 --> 01:38:41.748
who fell in love with a hole
in the ground.

01:38:42.333 --> 01:38:45.043
A ghost hauntin' his own grave.

01:38:47.838 --> 01:38:51.716
Celebratin' every six months
with the same party,

01:38:52.927 --> 01:38:56.304
waitin' for the same guest
of honor to show.

01:38:59.516 --> 01:39:03.186
Demarkov? Dead and buried.

01:39:04.897 --> 01:39:07.857
Everything I had, finito.

01:39:09.193 --> 01:39:13.404
Except that old voice in my head.

01:39:15.199 --> 01:39:17.533
Some things you never let go of.

01:39:18.953 --> 01:39:24.791
Of course, Natalie,
she wasn't the only guest invited.

01:39:26.835 --> 01:39:29.712
Can't be a party without a crowd.

01:39:38.097 --> 01:39:40.932
I don't remember much of 'em, really.

01:39:41.934 --> 01:39:44.477
Don't remember what I said to 'em,

01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:48.398
or what they said to me back.

01:39:50.859 --> 01:39:53.945
Don't remember how I felt.

01:39:57.574 --> 01:40:01.995
But once in a while, I do remember.

01:40:06.792 --> 01:40:08.668
How they looked at me.

01:40:55.007 --> 01:40:58.259
Well, I guess she's not gonna make it.

01:40:59.636 --> 01:41:02.055
Always next time, though, right?

01:41:04.016 --> 01:41:05.542
December 1st.

01:41:36.173 --> 01:41:37.340
Nat?

01:42:17.631 --> 01:42:21.509
Sometimes, she stays a little longer.

01:42:22.845 --> 01:42:24.512
But not too often.

01:43:12.978 --> 01:43:15.813
Maybe you think I'm ready to give up,

01:43:16.565 --> 01:43:18.566
but that ain't how it is.

01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:22.278
She could come walkin'
through that door any day.

01:43:25.949 --> 01:43:28.117
'Cause even after all of this,

01:43:30.913 --> 01:43:32.955
I bet she still loves me.
