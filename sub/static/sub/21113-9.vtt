WEBVTT

00:00.293 --> 00:01.625
There's changes afoot

00:01.661 --> 00:02.927
At "Scarlet," so let's catch up

00:02.961 --> 00:04.762
With our favorite young throuple.

00:04.797 --> 00:06.497
Jane set aside her political agenda

00:06.532 --> 00:08.298
To try her hand at clickbait...

00:08.299 --> 00:09.850
That interests you?

00:09.885 --> 00:11.251
Yes, I'm very interested in a butt facial.

00:11.287 --> 00:13.186
And caught something unexpected.

00:13.222 --> 00:15.821
We don't want you to just be
an "Incite" writer.

00:15.856 --> 00:17.723
We want you to be Jane Sloan.

00:17.758 --> 00:19.625
Sutton learned at crunch time

00:19.660 --> 00:22.428
That she can always count on herself.

00:22.463 --> 00:24.463
Yes, so fierce. Okay, let's step you in.

00:24.498 --> 00:26.732
Helpful, given her romantic status.

00:26.767 --> 00:28.534
This isn't gonna work, is it?

00:28.569 --> 00:30.502
So what are we deciding here?

00:30.538 --> 00:32.738
And Kat tried
to be long-distance friends

00:32.773 --> 00:34.640
With Adena, but in the end they realized

00:34.675 --> 00:36.608
They didn't want to be long-distance,

00:36.644 --> 00:38.677
And they definitely didn't
want to be just friends.

00:38.712 --> 00:41.480
What if I were to book a ticket

00:41.515 --> 00:43.449
To return to New York? What?

00:43.484 --> 00:45.617
So come travel
with us on "The Bold Type."

00:53.527 --> 00:54.693
We're officially late.

00:54.728 --> 00:56.628
I'm gonna miss the pitch meeting.

00:56.664 --> 00:58.497
How many times does Trump
have to come back here?

00:58.532 --> 01:00.365
Doesn't he live somewhere else now?

01:00.401 --> 01:02.634
Yeah, Mar-a-Lago.
How's the pro/con list coming?

01:02.670 --> 01:04.569
It's a pro/pro list.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.538
In this column is all the
reasons to stay at "Scarlet,"

01:06.574 --> 01:09.374
And in this column is all
the reasons to go to "Incite."

01:09.410 --> 01:12.411
You're not going to "Incite."
Yeah, but I might.

01:12.446 --> 01:13.779
I mean, look at this pro list.

01:13.814 --> 01:16.682
It's a super sexy startup,
it's well-funded,

01:16.717 --> 01:18.450
And there's no patriarchy upstairs

01:18.486 --> 01:19.785
Telling us what we can and can't cover.

01:19.820 --> 01:21.687
I have to give them
an answer by tomorrow,

01:21.722 --> 01:23.722
And I don't know what I'm gonna do.

01:23.757 --> 01:26.792
It's tied. Oh, I could help with that.

01:26.827 --> 01:30.562
"work with best..."

01:30.598 --> 01:32.531
"friends."

01:32.566 --> 01:34.800
oh!

01:34.835 --> 01:36.735
Sorry. Do you think that's a sign?

01:36.770 --> 01:38.537
That Sutton needs to quit primping

01:38.572 --> 01:40.372
Before she takes out an eye?

01:40.407 --> 01:42.474
Okay,
we're gonna let the universe decide.

01:42.510 --> 01:44.510
If the cab goes left at 34th,

01:44.545 --> 01:46.478
Then that means that I stay
at "Scarlet,"

01:46.514 --> 01:48.647
And if it goes right,
then that means I go to "Incite."

01:52.887 --> 01:54.586
oh, my God. What?

01:54.622 --> 01:56.488
What happened? She's over boston.

01:56.524 --> 01:58.423
Adena's plane should land
within the hour.

01:58.459 --> 01:59.758
I'm so happy at least
one of us is killing it

01:59.793 --> 02:01.560
In the dating department. Oh, hey, look,

02:01.595 --> 02:03.729
We're almost there.
My fate is in the hands

02:03.764 --> 02:05.731
Of the universe. Left, left, left.

02:08.769 --> 02:10.702
Sir, what is this? Why aren't we moving?

02:14.375 --> 02:15.574
Presidential motorcade.

02:15.609 --> 02:17.409
Oh, my God. What does this mean?

02:17.444 --> 02:19.645
That you're not going anywhere.

02:19.680 --> 02:21.580
Sir, is there anything you could do?

02:21.615 --> 02:23.582
Hang on, ladies.

02:23.617 --> 02:26.351
I'll get you there
on time if you tip me.

02:27.755 --> 02:29.721
Aah!

02:32.426 --> 02:34.459
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

02:41.769 --> 02:44.670
Good morning, Jacqueline. Thank you.

02:44.705 --> 02:47.673
Andrew, tell Miranda that
if she can't move that preview,

02:47.708 --> 02:49.441
I will have to conference in
from the sidelines

02:49.476 --> 02:50.742
Of my son's basketball game,

02:50.778 --> 02:52.711
Which I will absolutely do if necessary.

02:52.746 --> 02:54.546
Uh, the coach didn't really
appreciate that last time.

02:54.582 --> 02:56.582
Then let's get it moved. Thank you!

02:58.519 --> 03:00.519
Did everyone quit?
They're all running late

03:00.554 --> 03:02.688
Because of the road closures. Of course.

03:02.723 --> 03:05.390
Nevertheless, we will persist.

03:05.426 --> 03:06.592
I refuse to cancel a pitch meeting

03:06.627 --> 03:07.659
On account of that man.

03:07.695 --> 03:08.760
Jane, you first.

03:08.796 --> 03:10.596
Nothing political this time.

03:10.631 --> 03:12.331
We have that covered
with the feature piece

03:12.366 --> 03:14.633
That ella's doing. Okay, um...

03:17.805 --> 03:19.705
Oh, here it is.

03:19.740 --> 03:22.641
Gucci, St. Laurent,
and Burberry have all been experimenting

03:22.676 --> 03:24.610
With the concept of genderless fashion

03:24.645 --> 03:26.612
In their recent runways.
And we've covered it.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.547
With Tilda Swinton and Jaden Smith,

03:28.582 --> 03:31.350
But genderless fashion
isn't just for models

03:31.385 --> 03:33.485
And the celeb elite.
Retailers have been marketing

03:33.520 --> 03:35.587
To everyday consumers like you and...

03:35.623 --> 03:38.657
I'm not an everyday consumer.
Right... but I am,

03:38.692 --> 03:40.592
So I thought that
I could just spend a day

03:40.628 --> 03:42.694
In genderless clothes, see if that makes

03:42.730 --> 03:44.529
People interact with me differently.

03:44.565 --> 03:46.665
I would wear androgynous suits,

03:46.700 --> 03:49.801
Drop-crotch floral pants, and...
stop right there.

03:49.837 --> 03:52.704
You had me at "drop-crotch
floral pants,"

03:52.740 --> 03:54.840
But we need something more.

03:54.875 --> 03:57.809
Women have been donning menswear
for decades

03:57.845 --> 03:59.444
And calling it subversive, you know?

03:59.480 --> 04:01.546
We need that extra layer.

04:01.582 --> 04:02.648
Absolutely.

04:02.683 --> 04:05.717
Sorry, they shut down my stop,

04:05.753 --> 04:07.486
So I had to detour through midtown,
and then...

04:07.521 --> 04:09.488
And in walks our extra layer.

04:09.523 --> 04:11.423
I'm sorry? I really like your concept,

04:11.458 --> 04:13.792
Jane,
but we need the right man for the job.

04:13.827 --> 04:17.329
wait, what? Yeah, what?

04:17.363 --> 04:18.730
Jane'll tell you about the assignment.

04:18.766 --> 04:20.599
Let's get you doing
the "red check" this issue.

04:20.634 --> 04:21.800
The monthly quiz?

04:21.834 --> 04:23.335
You've got a problem with that?

04:23.370 --> 04:24.603
Nope, no problem.

04:26.640 --> 04:27.739
So, guess what?

04:27.775 --> 04:29.441
Jacqueline took my pitch

04:29.476 --> 04:30.676
And gave it to Alex.

04:30.711 --> 04:32.444
The intersectional feminism thing?

04:32.479 --> 04:33.779
No, I didn't even get to pitch that one.

04:33.814 --> 04:36.381
Now, instead,
I'm writing the monthly quiz.

04:36.417 --> 04:37.649
This is going in your pro-"Incite"
column,

04:37.685 --> 04:38.784
Isn't it? There's not a lot of

04:38.819 --> 04:40.585
Political real estate here,

04:40.621 --> 04:42.487
So...Yeah,
it's something to think about.

04:42.523 --> 04:43.722
Hey, which one did Alex take?

04:43.757 --> 04:45.590
This androgynous fashion piece.

04:45.626 --> 04:46.725
I wasn't even that excited about it,

04:46.760 --> 04:49.461
But it was still my pitch.

04:51.665 --> 04:54.566
It's pinstripe guy.

04:55.869 --> 04:57.669
Oh, you're just not gonna respond?

04:57.705 --> 04:59.438
Our chapter's closed. He wants coffee,

04:59.473 --> 05:00.706
Not relationship counseling.

05:00.741 --> 05:03.742
What! Sutton, don't.

05:03.777 --> 05:05.744
Oh, my God. Stop.

05:05.779 --> 05:08.647
Stop it, stop... ooh! you stop!

05:08.682 --> 05:12.384
Ooh, now I'm really curious.

05:14.000 --> 05:20.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:22.663 --> 05:23.729
Hey. Hey.

05:25.666 --> 05:27.366
Uh...

05:27.401 --> 05:28.800
I was surprised to hear from you.

05:28.836 --> 05:30.402
It's been a while.

05:30.437 --> 05:31.803
Yeah. What's up?

05:31.839 --> 05:34.339
I just wanted to say good-bye.

05:34.375 --> 05:35.540
good-bye? What?

05:35.576 --> 05:37.476
You won't be running into this guy

05:37.511 --> 05:39.344
In the elevator anymore.

05:39.413 --> 05:40.679
No more coffee shop banter,

05:40.714 --> 05:42.814
'cause...I just got fired.

05:42.850 --> 05:44.416
What? Yup.

05:44.451 --> 05:45.684
"pinstripe's" downsizing?

05:45.719 --> 05:47.686
Yeah, over half the editorial staff.

05:47.721 --> 05:49.654
I'm so sorry. Thanks.

05:49.690 --> 05:53.625
I'm still kind of in shock,
but I wanted to tell you

05:53.660 --> 05:56.728
That I liked sharing a lobby with you,
Jane Sloan.

05:56.764 --> 05:58.363
I'll miss seeing you around.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.831
Yeah, I'll miss seeing you too.

06:01.668 --> 06:03.769
Put that away.

06:07.541 --> 06:10.342
Good luck. Thanks.

06:10.377 --> 06:14.446
I've got to go, uh... Empty out my desk.

06:14.481 --> 06:15.447
Bye.

06:17.451 --> 06:20.318
Jane told me that you stole
her fashion story.

06:20.354 --> 06:21.620
I did the opposite of stealing it,

06:21.655 --> 06:22.754
And I'd like to give it back,

06:22.790 --> 06:24.656
So if you're her hired muscle...

06:24.691 --> 06:26.558
I'm actually here to pitch
myself as your stylist.

06:26.593 --> 06:29.594
Mercenary.
I love it, but what about Jane?

06:29.630 --> 06:32.764
She makes her own decisions,
as do I, so hear me out,

06:32.800 --> 06:34.666
And don't just give me a shot
because we're friends.

06:34.701 --> 06:36.501
Okay. Or do,

06:36.537 --> 06:38.370
Because friendship
is very important in business.

06:38.405 --> 06:39.704
Pitch me, Sutton. What do you got?

06:39.740 --> 06:41.540
So I'm thinking something accessible,

06:41.575 --> 06:42.741
But still strong.

06:44.745 --> 06:46.545
You want to put me in a dress?

06:46.580 --> 06:48.513
I want a solo styling
credit in the magazine.

06:48.549 --> 06:51.383
Putting you in a dress is a bonus.

06:51.418 --> 06:52.818
Oh, do you want to take that?

06:52.853 --> 06:54.519
Oh. No.

06:54.555 --> 06:56.621
I don't know what he wants. Anyway,

06:56.657 --> 06:58.757
Feel free to ask someone else,
but Oliver's really busy,

06:58.792 --> 07:00.559
And this would be a great shot for me.

07:00.594 --> 07:01.760
I would work really hard.

07:01.795 --> 07:03.495
You got it. Seriously?

07:03.530 --> 07:05.664
Show me what you got. Yes!

07:05.699 --> 07:08.700
Okay, I have to show you
the rest of the stuff.

07:14.341 --> 07:15.674
Hey. Finally.

07:15.709 --> 07:17.409
I've been following your flight.

07:17.444 --> 07:19.444
Kat? Are you on your way over?

07:19.480 --> 07:21.680
'cause I can leave early.
I made us reservations...

07:21.715 --> 07:24.349
No, Kat, there's a problem.

07:24.384 --> 07:26.551
I'm being held here at Customs.

07:26.587 --> 07:28.787
They won't let me into the country.

07:28.822 --> 07:30.589
What? They're putting me

07:30.624 --> 07:32.457
On a flight home tomorrow,
first one out.

07:32.493 --> 07:34.392
Wait,
they're sending you back to France?

07:34.428 --> 07:35.460
No, they can't do that.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.629
Not France, home.

07:37.664 --> 07:38.730
Oh, my God.

07:40.601 --> 07:42.667
Um, I can't be on the phone.
Kat, I'm...

07:42.703 --> 07:45.370
I just want to say I'm sorry,
and I tried.

07:45.405 --> 07:47.639
Adena, just tell me where
you are so that I can...

07:57.994 --> 07:59.160
What happened to pinstripe.

08:00.997 --> 08:02.864
What, what's going on?
They won't let Adena

08:02.899 --> 08:04.232
Into the country. Yeah, she's...

08:04.267 --> 08:06.868
She's not picking up, so... Do you think

08:06.903 --> 08:08.102
They took her phone?
Like, can they do that?

08:08.138 --> 08:10.204
I think they can do whatever they want.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.073
Okay, how can we help?

08:12.108 --> 08:14.809
I... I don't know.

08:14.844 --> 08:17.078
I don't know.

08:17.113 --> 08:19.981
Hello, you've reached
the Immigrant Rights Hotline,

08:20.016 --> 08:21.883
Serving all of New York State.

08:21.918 --> 08:24.185
Our current call volume
is extremely high.

08:24.220 --> 08:25.887
Please hold, and we'll be with
you as soon as we're able...

08:32.261 --> 08:34.162
Hi, Victoria. Jane, am I catching you

08:34.197 --> 08:36.931
At a bad time? No... yes.

08:36.966 --> 08:39.232
I'm sorry... I'm just helping a friend

08:39.269 --> 08:42.135
With some immigration issues.
I'm truly sorry to hear that.

08:42.172 --> 08:44.072
Look, I'll be fast.
I know you haven't made

08:44.107 --> 08:45.873
Your decision yet,
but we're getting down

08:45.909 --> 08:47.275
To the wire here.
I understand,

08:47.310 --> 08:48.976
And I really want to give you an answer.

08:49.012 --> 08:50.244
I just...
listen, I get it.

08:50.280 --> 08:51.946
You have a lot of loyalty to "Scarlet."

08:51.981 --> 08:52.947
I love that about you.

08:52.982 --> 08:54.048
I'm emailing a few

08:54.084 --> 08:55.283
Of our upcoming pieces,

08:55.318 --> 08:57.218
Which include an evisceration

08:57.253 --> 08:59.887
Of this administration's
immigration policy.

08:59.923 --> 09:01.255
If they excite you,
then I will expect to hear

09:01.291 --> 09:03.157
Good news from you tomorrow. Deal.

09:03.193 --> 09:04.258
And stay indoors today if you can,

09:04.294 --> 09:05.927
Because the president has things

09:05.962 --> 09:07.228
Totally screwed up out here.

09:07.263 --> 09:08.996
Thank you, Victoria, um...

09:09.032 --> 09:10.164
Talk soon.

09:13.303 --> 09:18.172
Hello?

09:18.208 --> 09:20.074
Okay, great, thank you so much.

09:20.110 --> 09:22.110
So that was legal aid.
They're gonna contact

09:22.145 --> 09:23.911
The authorities directly
and see if they can put

09:23.947 --> 09:25.213
The brakes on Adena's deportation.

09:25.248 --> 09:27.115
Okay, thanks. So, any luck?

09:27.150 --> 09:29.117
Have you heard anything? Nothing.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.285
Well, I just got off with
the immigrant rights hotline,

09:31.321 --> 09:34.021
And they said that Customs
doesn't need to give Adena

09:34.057 --> 09:36.891
A reason to turn her away.
Wish I could just talk to her.

09:36.926 --> 09:38.126
She's gonna call you as soon as she can.

09:38.161 --> 09:39.961
Yeah, when she gets home,

09:39.996 --> 09:42.163
A home that isn't exactly
super friendly to her.

09:42.198 --> 09:44.899
God, just call me.
I need to know that you're okay.

09:48.271 --> 09:50.304
I need to know she's okay.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.073
What are you doing? I'm buying a ticket.

09:52.108 --> 09:53.841
What? To where?

09:53.877 --> 09:55.977
It's the only way
to get through security

09:56.012 --> 09:58.146
And into the terminal,
and maybe I can see her.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.081
Look, air nazar. There's a flight out

10:00.116 --> 10:02.016
Tomorrow morning,
and that has to be the flight

10:02.051 --> 10:04.218
That they put her on.
Let's just take a breath.

10:04.254 --> 10:07.288
I don't have a breath, Jane.
I have 14 hours,

10:07.323 --> 10:09.223
And there's only one ticket left,

10:09.259 --> 10:11.125
So if you want a sign, that's a sign.

10:11.161 --> 10:12.226
That's not a sign.
That's a first-class ticket

10:12.262 --> 10:15.296
For...Just $11,000.

10:15.331 --> 10:17.198
$11,000?

10:17.233 --> 10:18.966
My parents have a bunch of
points that they never use,

10:19.002 --> 10:21.202
So I'll just, you know,
empty their account.

10:21.237 --> 10:23.237
This is crazy.

10:23.273 --> 10:25.940
Okay, I got to go pick up my passport.

10:25.975 --> 10:28.142
You are insane.
But really, really romantic.

10:28.178 --> 10:29.310
I love you. Good luck.

10:29.345 --> 10:31.212
Love you. Love you too.

10:37.020 --> 10:38.252
And if you're not feeling any of this,

10:38.288 --> 10:40.087
I do have a few pieces coming in

10:40.123 --> 10:42.089
From a boutique designer.

10:42.125 --> 10:44.091
Seriously?
You have to keep an open mind.

10:44.127 --> 10:45.993
This is the same
as when Jane had to try on

10:46.029 --> 10:48.329
All of those spanx at once,
or when sage had to figure out

10:48.364 --> 10:51.265
How to make under-boob work appropriate.

10:51.301 --> 10:54.001
Okay,
I'm getting a little nervous about this.

10:54.037 --> 10:55.269
Good, you should be.

10:55.305 --> 10:57.071
The response I was hoping for was,

10:57.106 --> 10:59.140
"don't worry, Alex. You can trust me."

10:59.175 --> 11:00.908
Oh, you can.

11:00.944 --> 11:02.910
No more Trump! No more Trump!

11:13.957 --> 11:15.856
what's this?

11:15.892 --> 11:17.959
Oh, hey, avert your eyes.

11:17.994 --> 11:19.126
You weren't supposed
to see me like this.

11:19.162 --> 11:20.995
With what I can only assume

11:21.030 --> 11:23.064
Is stolen stationery,

11:23.099 --> 11:26.033
A thing that looks like a sex toy,
and lube samples?

11:26.069 --> 11:27.235
I know, I'm hideous.

11:29.205 --> 11:31.038
I really am sorry about your job.

11:31.074 --> 11:32.240
No, we're not doing this.
We've already had

11:32.275 --> 11:34.041
Our tearful good-bye.

11:34.077 --> 11:36.177
I don't remember crying. Weird.

11:36.212 --> 11:38.079
You were devastated.

11:40.016 --> 11:41.315
What is going on? Yes, some of us

11:41.351 --> 11:43.117
Have plans to drink alone tonight.

11:43.152 --> 11:45.052
The President's having dinner next door,

11:45.088 --> 11:46.887
And there are protesters,

11:46.923 --> 11:49.023
So the Secret Service
shut down the block.

11:49.058 --> 11:51.993
I guess we go back up and wait it out?

11:52.028 --> 11:53.060
Yeah.

12:02.872 --> 12:06.040
This way. Okay... oh, okay.

12:15.351 --> 12:18.119
Adena!

12:18.154 --> 12:19.887
Kat?

12:19.922 --> 12:21.022
I can't believe I found you. Hey.

12:21.057 --> 12:22.990
What are you doing here?

12:32.518 --> 12:35.452
They confiscated my phone,
or I would have called you back.

12:35.487 --> 12:37.387
Oh, no, that's okay.

12:37.422 --> 12:38.722
I'm just trying to figure
out what's going on, like...

12:38.757 --> 12:41.558
So basically,
I haven't received the extension

12:41.593 --> 12:42.726
Of my work visa yet,

12:42.761 --> 12:44.761
So I thought that it was best

12:44.797 --> 12:46.630
For me to enter as a visitor.

12:46.665 --> 12:50.400
Right. But I guess I got flagged

12:50.435 --> 12:53.470
Because I only have a one-way ticket

12:53.505 --> 12:55.639
And no residence elsewhere,

12:55.674 --> 12:59.743
So I could just decide to stay
in the u.S. Illegally.

12:59.778 --> 13:02.546
And your visa application?

13:02.581 --> 13:05.482
Could actually be revoked now.

13:05.517 --> 13:07.717
I knew it was a risk...

13:07.753 --> 13:09.452
But I took it.

13:11.590 --> 13:13.323
Just so stupid.

13:13.358 --> 13:15.592
This is just a temporary obstacle.

13:15.627 --> 13:17.761
So, you'll go home.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.497
We'll get you a crazy-amazing lawyer,

13:20.532 --> 13:22.766
And we'll figure it out.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.435
You think so?

13:25.470 --> 13:27.404
Yeah.

13:27.439 --> 13:29.806
But... hey.

13:29.842 --> 13:32.409
Hey, Adena.

13:32.444 --> 13:34.578
I just want you to know that I'm here.

13:36.615 --> 13:38.515
I'm in this with you.

13:50.662 --> 13:52.829
Hey, Sutton. I saw you called.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.464
I'm calling you back. Take care.

13:56.869 --> 13:59.369
Hey, hi. Hi, Sutton.

13:59.404 --> 14:00.737
What's up?
No one can leave the building.

14:00.772 --> 14:02.439
Because... Trump.

14:02.474 --> 14:04.574
So...Vodka?

14:04.610 --> 14:05.575
I'm in.

14:07.579 --> 14:09.579
I was promised vodka.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.681
It's vodka-based.

14:11.717 --> 14:14.718
The unicorn dreamtini
is "Scarlet's" official cocktail

14:14.753 --> 14:16.553
Of fall. You're kidding.

14:16.588 --> 14:17.621
She's not. So, what are we drinking to?

14:17.656 --> 14:19.389
To new opportunities.

14:19.424 --> 14:20.657
And leaving old jobs behind.

14:20.692 --> 14:22.392
Wait, you're taking it? Taking what?

14:22.427 --> 14:23.526
He doesn't know about that yet.

14:23.562 --> 14:25.395
I don't know about what yet?

14:25.430 --> 14:26.730
So what were you talking about,
new opportunities?

14:26.765 --> 14:28.498
I think she was trying
to make me feel better

14:28.533 --> 14:29.566
About the fact that I just got fired.

14:29.601 --> 14:31.768
Bottoms up.

14:31.803 --> 14:33.603
I'm sorry.

14:33.639 --> 14:36.339
Well,
that tastes exactly the way it looks.

14:36.375 --> 14:37.674
Mm. What are you two

14:37.709 --> 14:40.777
Talking about?
I got a job offer at "Incite."

14:40.812 --> 14:43.346
You got the "Incite" job?

14:43.382 --> 14:45.749
I was gonna tell you...

14:45.784 --> 14:47.450
But I don't even know if I'm taking it.

14:48.720 --> 14:50.353
Dreamtini?

15:02.367 --> 15:05.302
Everything okay? Yeah.

15:05.337 --> 15:07.604
Mm, that's sweet... they're concerned.

15:07.639 --> 15:08.638
Mm-hmm.

15:11.543 --> 15:14.377
I just don't want to worry them,
you know?

15:14.413 --> 15:16.613
Get a million calls and texts.

15:16.648 --> 15:19.749
I don't really feel like
being on my phone right now.

15:19.785 --> 15:22.485
You know, we still have ten hours left.

15:22.521 --> 15:25.455
Yeah, not a lot of time.
It's not nothing.

15:27.826 --> 15:30.527
You know what?

15:30.562 --> 15:33.663
Adena el-amin,
will you go on a date with me?

15:33.699 --> 15:35.665
Yes.

15:35.701 --> 15:38.501
I thought you would never ask.
All right...

15:39.671 --> 15:41.538
Sorry, I was surprised before,

15:41.573 --> 15:43.540
But congrats, by the way, on "Incite."

15:43.575 --> 15:46.609
I see big things for you.

15:46.645 --> 15:50.413
Hey, I'm really sorry.
I should have told you.

15:50.449 --> 15:51.781
Eh, it's not personal. It's business.

15:51.817 --> 15:53.783
It's both. Well, besides, it turns out

15:53.819 --> 15:58.755
I'm...Actually happy where I am.

15:58.790 --> 16:02.525
Stuck in the steinem building
with a cheap bottle of tequila?

16:02.561 --> 16:04.527
Exactly.

16:04.563 --> 16:06.296
Here, take these.

16:10.602 --> 16:12.369
smart man.

16:12.404 --> 16:15.305
Sutton found a deck of cards.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.440
Do you want to join us? Maybe later.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.309
But don't let her shuffle.

16:19.344 --> 16:21.611
She cheats.

16:21.646 --> 16:25.682
I knew it. Sutton, a word, please.

16:25.717 --> 16:28.485
Yes... yes.

16:35.394 --> 16:38.395
Please don't jump.
Well, I wasn't going to,

16:38.430 --> 16:40.563
But now that you mention it...

16:40.599 --> 16:43.333
My take on a tequila sunrise.

16:43.368 --> 16:45.368
My dad's favorite.

16:45.404 --> 16:46.703
Cheers. Cheers.

16:49.741 --> 16:51.775
See? Isn't this so much better

16:51.810 --> 16:53.443
Than drinking alone?

16:53.478 --> 16:55.345
It's like bizarro world up here.

16:55.380 --> 16:57.714
We have the exact same view
from our conference room...

16:57.749 --> 17:01.351
Or... "pinstripe's" conference room.

17:01.386 --> 17:03.286
Speaking of which, is Scarlet girl

17:03.321 --> 17:04.621
Really leaving "Scarlet?"

17:04.656 --> 17:06.522
Kind of feels like the universe

17:06.558 --> 17:08.391
Is trying to keep me here.

17:08.426 --> 17:09.592
Well, forget about the universe.

17:09.627 --> 17:11.493
What does your pro/con list tell you?

17:11.530 --> 17:14.464
What makes you so sure
that I have a pro/con list?

17:14.499 --> 17:17.333
I know you. Come on, let's see it.

17:17.368 --> 17:18.501
You don't know me at all.

17:18.537 --> 17:19.769
It's a pro/pro list.

17:19.805 --> 17:21.503
I don't want you or Jane to leave.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.772
I'm not going anywhere. Not by choice.

17:23.809 --> 17:26.409
Oh, okay, okay. Burn.

17:26.444 --> 17:27.743
Sorry. I have made my peace.

17:27.779 --> 17:29.479
Yeah. You know, I remember

17:29.514 --> 17:31.448
When you first started. You do?

17:31.483 --> 17:33.750
It was really hard
not to notice the khakis.

17:33.785 --> 17:36.653
Oh, aces Trump jacks. Drink.

17:36.688 --> 17:39.522
You just said the no-no word. Oh, man.

17:39.558 --> 17:41.658
Take a drink.
Touche.

17:45.464 --> 17:46.663
Ah. Ugh.

17:46.698 --> 17:48.331
You were so serious back then,

17:48.366 --> 17:49.766
I told Jane I didn't think

17:49.801 --> 17:51.768
You would last six months.
Uh, thank you very much?

17:51.803 --> 17:54.471
Well, I was wrong.

17:54.506 --> 17:57.340
What was your first impression of me?

17:57.375 --> 17:58.675
That you were stuck up. What?

17:58.710 --> 18:00.643
You asked. I'm not stuck up.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.479
I would say good morning to you,

18:02.514 --> 18:04.481
And you would barely
look up from this desk.

18:04.516 --> 18:08.284
I was busy...And tortured.
And judging my khakis.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.353
Always judging the khakis.

18:10.388 --> 18:11.754
So what would happen
if we got you out of them?

18:15.560 --> 18:18.294
Looks like "Incite" has pulled ahead.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.729
It's still a work in progress.

18:19.764 --> 18:21.664
Jane,
you could fill this whole notebook up

18:21.700 --> 18:23.566
With pros about "Incite."

18:23.602 --> 18:25.668
"Scarlet" is what you know.
It's what you love.

18:27.706 --> 18:30.340
Yeah, which means it's safe.

18:30.375 --> 18:32.442
Well, I don't mean it in a bad way.

18:32.477 --> 18:35.612
"Incite" is a risk. It's the unknown.

18:35.647 --> 18:38.515
Not exactly your two favorite things.

18:38.550 --> 18:42.452
Okay...Well,
let's just remember who kissed who.

18:42.487 --> 18:43.553
See, that's what I'm talking about.

18:43.588 --> 18:45.522
When you do take a risk,

18:45.557 --> 18:47.690
It seems to pay off.

18:47.726 --> 18:50.627
You've scored political exclusives,

18:50.662 --> 18:52.595
First orgasms...

18:52.631 --> 18:53.663
Me.

18:56.501 --> 18:59.502
Do you ever wonder
if this could have worked?

19:01.773 --> 19:05.375
Hey, guys! I think we can see Trump.

19:05.410 --> 19:07.410
Yeah, I'm gonna take you out for dinner.

19:07.445 --> 19:09.279
Somewhere really fancy, like, uh...

19:09.314 --> 19:10.513
sbarro. Oh!

19:10.549 --> 19:12.282
or cinnabon.

19:12.317 --> 19:14.384
Oof. The night is ours.

19:14.419 --> 19:15.718
How romantic.

19:19.424 --> 19:22.292
Oh, no, everything is closed. It's okay.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.527
I'm really not that hungry.
I said I would take you out

19:24.563 --> 19:26.362
On a date...

19:26.398 --> 19:29.732
And I'm gonna take you out on a date.

19:29.768 --> 19:31.301
Come on.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.411
What exactly am I looking for?
Alex said he saw

19:41.446 --> 19:43.413
A small orange blur.

19:43.448 --> 19:45.481
I said I thought I saw the motorcade.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.482
Same thing.

19:47.752 --> 19:51.321
I think we should go back
to the conference room.

19:51.356 --> 19:52.655
It's on the other side of the building.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.424
We're not even gonna
be able to see anything.

19:54.459 --> 19:55.525
She's intimidated by this office.

19:55.560 --> 19:56.726
No, I'm not.

19:56.761 --> 19:59.495
I just respect its sanctity.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.364
You know what I want? One of these.

20:01.399 --> 20:03.666
Okay, please don't change the settings.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.603
Jane, come here.

20:06.638 --> 20:08.771
You want to figure out
if you should stay at "Scarlet?"

20:08.807 --> 20:11.407
Well, have a seat.

20:11.443 --> 20:13.743
What? No.

20:13.778 --> 20:15.678
Not until I've earned it.
How do you know

20:15.714 --> 20:17.780
You really want it
if you haven't tried it?

20:17.816 --> 20:19.682
Come on,
imagine that all of this is yours.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.451
You've worked hard. You've risen up

20:21.486 --> 20:23.386
Through the ranks under the guidance

20:23.421 --> 20:25.688
Of Jacqueline Carlyle.
Now, take your rightful place

20:25.724 --> 20:27.690
As editor-in-chief.

20:31.396 --> 20:32.362
Okay.

20:36.835 --> 20:39.369
How does it feel? Mm, feels pretty good.

20:40.672 --> 20:41.671
Hello, everyone.

20:44.809 --> 20:47.610
Jacqueline, we're, uh,
stuck in the building.

20:47.646 --> 20:49.545
Yes, as am I.

20:49.581 --> 20:51.414
I was just upstairs with the board

20:51.449 --> 20:52.782
While you were all down here,

20:52.817 --> 20:55.618
Apparently making yourselves
at home in my office.

20:55.654 --> 20:57.620
We didn't know you were here.
we were just

20:57.656 --> 20:58.721
Looking at Trump. Why don't you just...

20:58.757 --> 20:59.756
get out?

20:59.791 --> 21:01.691
Yeah. Yeah.

21:12.637 --> 21:14.437
Andrew! Here!

21:23.048 --> 21:25.082
W we can have our date.

21:25.117 --> 21:29.853
Well, this is certainly
an upgrade from sbarro.

21:29.889 --> 21:32.122
First class, baby.

21:32.158 --> 21:34.925
You know, in all my travels
I never flew first class?

21:34.960 --> 21:37.094
Really? Once, actually, I sat

21:37.129 --> 21:40.130
On a plastic folding chair
taped to the floor.

21:40.166 --> 21:42.299
I don't think it was entirely legal.

21:42.334 --> 21:45.102
Well, sounds exciting, though.
More like death-defying,

21:45.137 --> 21:48.272
But...We landed in one piece.

21:48.307 --> 21:52.075
So exactly how many countries
have you actually visited?

21:54.113 --> 21:55.078
Oh...

21:57.249 --> 21:59.183
Oh, wow, you added pages?
I didn't even know

21:59.218 --> 22:02.252
You could do that.
I left home very young.

22:02.288 --> 22:04.154
17.

22:04.190 --> 22:06.190
I couldn't even do
my own laundry when I was 17.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.263
You know, everywhere I go,

22:13.299 --> 22:15.232
I discover something new about myself.

22:15.267 --> 22:20.270
Amsterdam was where I first
fell in love with a woman.

22:20.306 --> 22:22.940
South Africa was where I discovered

22:22.975 --> 22:26.276
The power of portrait photography.

22:26.312 --> 22:30.981
Everything you want to know
about me is in those pages.

22:31.016 --> 22:32.916
I haven't done anything.

22:32.952 --> 22:36.153
I've just spent my entire
adult life in one city.

22:36.188 --> 22:39.890
But you had something I didn't have...

22:39.925 --> 22:41.992
Stability. Mm.

22:42.027 --> 22:45.963
You know, I am very grateful
for all my experiences,

22:45.998 --> 22:49.233
But I feel I'm ready
to stay still for a minute...

22:49.268 --> 22:51.301
To build a home.

22:51.337 --> 22:55.138
Although,
I do not know where that will be now.

22:58.010 --> 22:59.943
Shall we eat? That's what I brought

22:59.979 --> 23:01.945
You here for, our date.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.114
What would you like?
Let me get it for you.

23:04.149 --> 23:05.182
What do you need? I'd like to start

23:05.217 --> 23:06.183
With dessert.

23:23.836 --> 23:26.003
You know,
tequila really does taste better

23:26.038 --> 23:27.871
The second time down.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.874
I'll have to take your word for it.

23:30.910 --> 23:35.012
Hey, so...Do you think I'm risk-averse?

23:35.047 --> 23:36.847
Definitely. Why?

23:36.882 --> 23:38.248
Oh,
it was just something pinstripe said.

23:38.284 --> 23:40.250
He thinks you're being
risk-averse to the job?

23:40.286 --> 23:42.853
No, about what happened with him,

23:42.888 --> 23:44.922
But that's not true. Just...

23:44.957 --> 23:48.292
Whatever we had ran its course.

23:48.327 --> 23:50.027
Right? That's one way to put it.

23:50.062 --> 23:52.829
You broke up with him

23:52.865 --> 23:53.897
Before you could give it a chance

23:53.933 --> 23:56.166
And see where it went.

23:56.201 --> 23:57.234
Richard called me.

23:59.104 --> 24:01.238
Why? He's calling me back.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.907
It was such a polite voicemail.

24:03.943 --> 24:06.910
I don't know why I called him.

24:06.946 --> 24:07.978
Yeah, you do.

24:09.949 --> 24:12.983
I loved him, and I never told him.

24:13.018 --> 24:14.184
If it was meant to be,

24:14.219 --> 24:16.987
Do you think it would be this hard?

24:17.022 --> 24:20.190
Let the genderless fashion show begin.

24:20.225 --> 24:22.926
Ooh! You guys look amazing.

24:24.063 --> 24:25.929
Oh, this has to come out.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.098
What do you mean? The sling is in.

24:28.133 --> 24:29.266
It's out.

24:29.301 --> 24:31.835
How is this happening, marcel?

24:31.870 --> 24:35.005
How many courses can he eat?

24:35.040 --> 24:36.807
Well, he sent the steaks back

24:36.842 --> 24:38.809
Because what he really wants
is a burger.

24:38.844 --> 24:42.045
It's your restaurant.
Send over the check.

24:44.216 --> 24:46.049
Marcel, Marcel... Marcel!

24:46.085 --> 24:47.884
We all need to get on with our lives.

24:49.221 --> 24:50.887
Y... gah.

24:59.198 --> 25:02.065
"how to tell

25:02.101 --> 25:03.133
If he wants to have a threesome."

25:03.168 --> 25:04.968
The answer is yes.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.004
"with another dude." okay.

25:07.039 --> 25:09.139
So, okay, this is your assignment?

25:09.174 --> 25:10.841
You have to write one of these quizzes?

25:10.876 --> 25:12.109
Well, someone's got to do it,

25:12.144 --> 25:14.211
And this month it's my turn.

25:14.246 --> 25:16.179
All right, well, let's see what we got.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.849
"are you too obsessed with your ex?"

25:18.884 --> 25:21.785
Next... drink. Why, what did I do?

25:21.820 --> 25:23.186
Just drink. Okay.

25:25.824 --> 25:28.091
"what does your netflix queue

25:28.127 --> 25:30.027
Say about your love life?" hmm.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.195
"is your queue mostly a, fun sitcoms,

25:32.231 --> 25:34.097
"b, home renovation shows, or c,

25:34.133 --> 25:36.033
Serial killer documentaries
and prison dramas?"

25:36.068 --> 25:39.803
C, and that means I am a...
Killer in the bedroom.

25:39.838 --> 25:41.171
Very nice.

25:41.206 --> 25:43.807
Well, I wrote the quiz,
so I stacked the answers.

25:43.842 --> 25:45.909
Okay, mine would

25:45.944 --> 25:49.046
Be home renovation shows.
That means that you, Jane,

25:49.081 --> 25:52.015
Are a "restless romantic.
You're always looking

25:52.051 --> 25:56.086
To upgrade your life,
even when it may not need it."

25:56.121 --> 25:58.188
That's scary.
Nothing personal, of course.

25:58.223 --> 25:59.890
No, it's fine,

25:59.925 --> 26:03.126
And I think I found a pitch for my quiz.

26:03.162 --> 26:05.962
"how do you know when it's time
to move on from your job?"

26:05.998 --> 26:08.865
Easy, they fire you, right? Ooh.

26:08.901 --> 26:10.200
Too soon? Your friends are mean.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.969
You drink.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.905
No, but seriously, let's write this.

26:14.940 --> 26:17.207
I'm gonna let this quiz decide my fate.

26:17.242 --> 26:18.975
Where's my...

26:19.011 --> 26:21.244
What? Oh, my God.

26:21.280 --> 26:22.879
What? My notebook.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.214
Ah... you're on, like, a nine.

26:24.249 --> 26:26.049
I'm gonna need you
to come down to a four.

26:26.085 --> 26:27.250
I think I left it
in Jacqueline's office.

26:27.286 --> 26:29.886
Are you sure? No, I don't...

26:31.957 --> 26:35.125
So what? It was open to my list.

26:39.865 --> 26:41.832
So what's the plan, slim?

26:41.867 --> 26:45.001
Okay, so we are just gonna do
a super casual walk-by,

26:45.037 --> 26:47.204
Peek in, and just see if it's there.

26:47.272 --> 26:50.841
Let's do it. But, um...

26:50.909 --> 26:54.111
Be casual. Oh, yeah, totally.

26:54.146 --> 26:56.980
We're super casual.
We're just two people,

26:57.015 --> 26:59.983
Out for a walk in an office, drunk,

27:00.018 --> 27:01.751
Wearing gender neutral clothing.
She'll never see it coming.

27:03.021 --> 27:04.921
Jane.

27:04.957 --> 27:06.823
We need to talk.

27:08.827 --> 27:10.994
So, how do you like your outfit?

27:11.029 --> 27:12.829
Well, I don't feel like myself,

27:12.865 --> 27:17.000
But that's not always such a bad thing.

27:17.035 --> 27:20.170
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

27:20.205 --> 27:24.174
It turns out that number 45 has
ordered a souffle to go along

27:24.209 --> 27:26.243
With his two scoops of ice cream,

27:26.278 --> 27:28.145
Which has an hour prep time.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.247
So, anyone want a scotch?

27:30.282 --> 27:31.248
Yeah.

27:35.988 --> 27:37.154
hey!

27:37.189 --> 27:41.024
Hey. I wasn't ready.

27:41.059 --> 27:43.193
You know, I'm thinking about
starting a new photo series.

27:43.228 --> 27:45.028
Oh, really? Is this a follow up

27:45.063 --> 27:46.963
To "the woman behind the veil?" yes.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.266
The working title is "the woman
inside the pillow fort."

27:49.301 --> 27:52.802
Oh!

27:52.838 --> 27:55.138
You know, I like our pillow fort.

27:55.174 --> 27:56.940
Maybe you could make this your home.

27:56.975 --> 27:59.075
I have lived in worse places. Mm.

28:01.213 --> 28:04.748
You know, this reminds me of growing up.

28:04.783 --> 28:06.116
I think every kid builds forts.

28:06.151 --> 28:08.985
It's a...A rite of passage.

28:09.021 --> 28:11.755
No, not really the fort.

28:11.790 --> 28:14.090
It's the quiet.

28:14.126 --> 28:18.862
'cause it was always just me
and my shrink parents,

28:18.897 --> 28:21.932
And we never even fought.

28:21.967 --> 28:24.234
If anyone was pissed off
about something,

28:24.269 --> 28:26.937
We would sit down
at the dining room table,

28:26.972 --> 28:30.207
And we would talk it out for hours.

28:30.275 --> 28:33.076
That sounds very... evolved.

28:33.111 --> 28:35.078
Yes, it was. Civilized.

28:35.113 --> 28:37.847
yeah, I hated it.

28:37.883 --> 28:40.116
God, I was so bored.

28:40.185 --> 28:42.953
So I... I moved to New York,

28:42.988 --> 28:47.023
Because I wanted dirt and imperfection

28:47.059 --> 28:50.827
And really cheap hot dogs.

28:50.862 --> 28:54.064
You came to the right place. Yeah.

28:54.099 --> 28:56.800
Okay, this is me.

28:56.835 --> 28:59.135
Mm. It's almost empty.

29:02.007 --> 29:05.008
That just means there's
more room for possibility.

29:05.043 --> 29:08.211
Sure. With an american passport,

29:08.247 --> 29:11.147
You could do anything.

29:11.183 --> 29:12.983
Yeah, that's what I want to do.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.187
Adena,
I know that you said that you're tired

29:17.222 --> 29:20.190
Of adventure and everything, but...

29:20.225 --> 29:23.126
I've never had one.

29:23.161 --> 29:27.130
And I already have the plane ticket,
so...

29:27.165 --> 29:28.999
What if I just went with you?

29:35.248 --> 29:38.215
Ronic music]

29:40.687 --> 29:42.319
This is fun.

29:45.625 --> 29:48.592
Now, what were you guys doing before?

29:48.628 --> 29:51.495
I heard laughter in here.

29:51.531 --> 29:53.564
Um...

29:53.599 --> 29:55.232
Not a trick question.

29:56.602 --> 30:00.237
They were just helping me with my quiz.

30:00.273 --> 30:02.440
Oh, yeah, she came up with

30:02.475 --> 30:04.575
"how to tell when it's time
to move on from your job."

30:04.610 --> 30:07.244
I-I don't think that was a good idea,
though.

30:07.280 --> 30:08.512
Well, it is a good one.

30:08.548 --> 30:10.247
Did you come up with some questions?

30:10.283 --> 30:11.682
Did we? We didn't really get that far.

30:11.718 --> 30:13.551
Well, let's do it now, all of us.

30:13.586 --> 30:15.586
Fun. Somebody grab a notepad.

30:15.621 --> 30:17.455
Yeah, I have a notepad. All right.

30:17.490 --> 30:21.292
Anybody, a first question?

30:21.327 --> 30:23.427
Uh, hmm...

30:23.463 --> 30:26.530
Jane? I was thinking that, um...

30:26.566 --> 30:30.334
Maybe it's time to move on from your job

30:30.369 --> 30:35.606
When you feel like you've
learned everything that you can.

30:35.641 --> 30:38.642
Or if your employer doesn't give you

30:38.678 --> 30:43.447
Adequate opportunities... For growth.

30:43.483 --> 30:45.683
That would be a strong indication.

30:45.718 --> 30:48.686
Let me write that down.
Sorry to interrupt.

30:48.721 --> 30:51.455
Building's clear,
and you can all go home.

30:51.491 --> 30:53.424
What a relief. Hoorah.

30:53.459 --> 30:56.393
Thank you. Thank you, frank.

30:56.429 --> 30:59.263
Well, that was fun.
See you all tomorrow.

31:02.301 --> 31:04.568
I could always just work remotely

31:04.604 --> 31:07.671
Or drum up freelance gigs, or...

31:07.707 --> 31:10.674
Just not work at all,
you know, see the country.

31:10.710 --> 31:13.444
I can't believe
we're talking about this.

31:13.479 --> 31:16.213
are we talking about this?

31:16.249 --> 31:18.616
Yeah, why not?
Your friends, your home...

31:18.651 --> 31:22.286
Everything is here.
It'll be here when I get back.

31:22.321 --> 31:25.356
Or it won't. I don't care.

31:25.391 --> 31:27.324
You might care later.
No, I don't feel like

31:27.360 --> 31:30.394
Being logical right now. I feel like...

31:30.429 --> 31:32.263
I feel like I want to get out of here.

31:32.298 --> 31:35.499
I...
I could be your personal tour guide.

31:35.535 --> 31:38.702
I would show you
the most incredible places.

31:38.738 --> 31:40.538
Yeah,
and you could teach me the language.

31:40.573 --> 31:42.640
Like, how do you say, um...

31:42.675 --> 31:45.643
"what is the wi-fi password?"
in persian?

31:45.678 --> 31:47.344
This is very important.

31:51.384 --> 31:54.285
I feel like that wasn't
"what is the wi-fi password?"

31:54.320 --> 31:55.486
Was it?

31:59.258 --> 32:01.192
What's that one?

32:01.227 --> 32:03.227
You are so beautiful.

32:12.605 --> 32:15.239
Hey, where do you want us to put these?

32:15.274 --> 32:17.208
Oh, you can just leave them.
I'll put them away.

32:17.243 --> 32:19.476
Great, thank you.
Are you sure you don't need

32:19.512 --> 32:21.478
Any help? I could stay.

32:22.682 --> 32:25.316
No, I'm good... go. Okay, bye.

32:25.351 --> 32:26.650
Bye. Goodnight.

32:31.724 --> 32:35.492
Have a good night, andrew.
Well, that was exciting.

32:35.528 --> 32:37.528
Yeah, yes, it was.

32:37.563 --> 32:40.631
Thank you for giving me refuge.
Well, I am glad we could help.

32:43.369 --> 32:45.369
Ryan,
do you think you could go on ahead?

32:45.404 --> 32:46.704
I just want to have
a quick word with Jane.

32:48.608 --> 32:49.573
Sure.

32:57.583 --> 33:00.417
I know you're frustrated
that I assigned you the quiz.

33:00.453 --> 33:03.354
No, I wasn't excited about it, but...

33:03.389 --> 33:07.424
And I have been thinking
about that idea you floated...

33:07.460 --> 33:11.262
How to know when it is time
to move on from your job.

33:11.297 --> 33:13.197
And that is a very important question.

33:13.232 --> 33:15.432
When I was considering
taking this job at "Scarlet,"

33:15.468 --> 33:16.667
It was a very different magazine...

33:16.702 --> 33:19.236
Much more conservative, set in its ways,

33:19.272 --> 33:21.639
And I knew it was an incredible risk

33:21.674 --> 33:23.507
To come in and shift its identity.

33:23.542 --> 33:27.344
I could fail... spectacularly,

33:27.380 --> 33:29.513
And I almost didn't take
the job because of that,

33:29.548 --> 33:34.418
But looking back, that's exactly
why it was the right decision.

33:34.453 --> 33:36.553
Because it was the one
that scared the shit out of me.

33:41.327 --> 33:43.427
I will be sure to work
that into the quiz.

33:45.531 --> 33:47.631
Good.

33:54.674 --> 33:56.707
You're still here. Yeah, I'm surprised

33:56.742 --> 33:59.343
No one's brought me
another dreamtini by now.

33:59.378 --> 34:01.245
I don't think you need another.

34:01.280 --> 34:04.181
I probably don't.

34:04.216 --> 34:06.450
So, did she find your notebook?

34:06.485 --> 34:08.518
I have absolutely no idea.

34:08.554 --> 34:10.219
Well,
it probably won't make a difference

34:10.255 --> 34:11.522
Either way if you leave.

34:11.556 --> 34:13.389
What are you gonna do about "Incite?"

34:13.426 --> 34:15.391
I have absolutely no idea.
Well, let me know when

34:15.428 --> 34:16.560
You make up your mind.

34:23.601 --> 34:25.502
Wait, ryan?

34:25.538 --> 34:28.438
Why did you call me...

34:28.474 --> 34:30.341
When you found out about your job?

34:30.376 --> 34:31.675
You know why.

34:31.710 --> 34:34.311
Don't over-think it, Jane.

34:40.252 --> 34:42.252
You have the legs

34:42.288 --> 34:44.554
For a skirt, my friend.
Hey, my butt looks good

34:44.590 --> 34:46.389
In that skirt. Agreed.

34:46.425 --> 34:49.226
Yes, you do. I will take the next one.

34:49.261 --> 34:51.495
This chariot is yours, madam.

34:51.530 --> 34:52.563
For me? Mm-hmm.

34:52.598 --> 34:54.297
Thank you.

37:12.163 --> 37:13.829
Ugh.

37:20.038 --> 37:22.872
Good morning. Morning.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.907
I could use some aspirin and coffee,
yeah?

37:24.942 --> 37:29.745
Yeah, that's two for me, thank you.

37:36.120 --> 37:38.788
I can go get us breakfast.

37:38.823 --> 37:41.991
No, five more minutes.

37:42.026 --> 37:43.826
Okay.

37:59.043 --> 38:00.743
Oh, my God, you're here early.

38:00.778 --> 38:02.111
Yep.

38:16.928 --> 38:18.861
Good morning, passengers.

38:18.896 --> 38:22.865
This is flight 815 now ready
to begin initial boarding.

38:22.900 --> 38:24.867
Are you ready? Yeah.

38:24.902 --> 38:27.803
What's persian for "this is crazy"?

38:59.704 --> 39:00.870
We are now inviting
those passengers joining us

39:00.905 --> 39:02.705
In our first-class cabin

39:02.740 --> 39:04.840
To make your way toward
the boarding area.

39:04.876 --> 39:06.742
That's you.

39:06.778 --> 39:07.810
No, it's okay.

39:07.845 --> 39:09.812
I'll wait with you.

39:14.886 --> 39:18.020
Hey, Victoria, it's Jane Sloan.

39:18.055 --> 39:21.824
Hi, uh, listen,
I read the stories you sent me,

39:21.859 --> 39:25.027
And honestly,
joining your staff feels like

39:25.062 --> 39:28.164
A really massive leap for me,

39:28.199 --> 39:30.766
Which is why I'm accepting your offer.

39:30.802 --> 39:33.736
I'm taking the job.

40:01.132 --> 40:03.098
We need to talk. Yeah, we do.

40:03.134 --> 40:04.900
Have you seen Kat?

40:04.936 --> 40:08.103
Never mind. We need to talk now.

40:08.139 --> 40:10.005
We'll now continue with regular boarding

40:10.041 --> 40:12.842
For those passengers seated
in rows 18 or higher.

40:12.877 --> 40:15.845
That's me.

40:17.849 --> 40:19.815
You ready?

40:22.119 --> 40:23.953
Uh...

40:26.991 --> 40:28.757
Adena, I...

40:28.793 --> 40:29.992
Kat.

40:30.027 --> 40:32.228
Look at me.

40:32.263 --> 40:35.164
If you want to go,
you have to go for yourself.

40:35.199 --> 40:39.001
If you want to stay, you...
you should stay.

40:39.036 --> 40:41.971
Uh...

40:42.039 --> 40:43.772
I'm sorry.

40:43.808 --> 40:45.941
You have nothing to apologize for.

40:45.977 --> 40:48.043
No, I'm sorry that you're the one going,

40:48.079 --> 40:50.112
And I'm the one crying.

40:50.147 --> 40:51.213
No.

40:53.818 --> 40:55.985
It's okay.

40:56.020 --> 40:57.887
Everything is gonna be okay.

40:57.922 --> 40:59.188
Yep.
