00:18.945 --> 00:20.845
It's alive!

00:39.199 --> 00:42.100
In "Tonight's news," you can
find the words "night," "tight,"

00:42.168 --> 00:45.695
"tits," "tots," "stew," "wino,"
"ghost" and the name "Toni,"

00:45.772 --> 00:47.205
if spell it with an "i".

00:48.841 --> 00:50.331
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

00:50.410 --> 00:51.308
Oh, my god!

00:51.377 --> 00:53.937
Oh, my god!
Not one more day of this!

00:54.013 --> 00:57.471
<i>Not one more day!</i>

01:07.327 --> 01:08.658
Oh, this is gonna be good.

01:09.629 --> 01:10.823
Honey, what are you doing?

01:10.897 --> 01:11.727
Shut up!

01:11.798 --> 01:13.766
That's what I'm doing.

01:18.371 --> 01:19.201
Ha!

01:19.272 --> 01:21.297
Time to go to work.

01:21.374 --> 01:22.363
Be careful, dear.

01:22.442 --> 01:23.875
You are not the boss of me!

01:27.814 --> 01:28.712
Aah!

01:28.781 --> 01:30.874
Jewish fucking holiday!

01:33.386 --> 01:36.617
Ha!
Are you not entertained?!

01:36.689 --> 01:37.917
No!

01:37.991 --> 01:38.980
Do a dance!

01:40.960 --> 01:42.427
# Ah doo bop da-da la doo da #

01:42.495 --> 01:43.723
# Da ooh dah #

01:43.796 --> 01:45.388
# Ah ta da dun dun dun da-dun #

01:45.465 --> 01:47.592
# Diddly daa! #

01:47.667 --> 01:50.636
Are you not entertained now?!

01:50.703 --> 01:52.500
Tell a joke!

01:53.806 --> 01:57.173
A priest, a rabbi, and a monk
walk into a...

01:57.243 --> 01:59.404
What's a rabbi?!

01:59.479 --> 02:01.037
Okay, I'm gonna show you these
cards,

02:01.114 --> 02:02.411
and you just tell
me what you see.

02:02.482 --> 02:03.506
Breasts!

02:03.583 --> 02:04.914
Boobs!
Knockers!

02:04.984 --> 02:06.383
Funbags!
Hooters!

02:06.452 --> 02:07.441
Dirty pillows!

02:07.520 --> 02:08.350
Milk sacks!

02:08.420 --> 02:09.683
Ta-tas!
Melons!

02:09.756 --> 02:11.280
Gazongas!
Flesh pumpkins!

02:11.357 --> 02:13.086
Sweater meat!
Nipple backstops!

02:13.159 --> 02:14.683
Big, bopplin' boobly oobly
ooblies!

02:14.761 --> 02:15.955
Two moons in tractor beam!

02:16.029 --> 02:18.623
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-
mmm-mmm!

02:18.698 --> 02:21.565
Just tell me your demands and
we can end this!

02:21.634 --> 02:24.660
There's no reason to hurt those
babies!

02:24.737 --> 02:29.106
All I want is for someone to
tell me that they love me!

02:36.182 --> 02:38.309
I knew nobody loved me!

02:38.384 --> 02:41.444
It's your fault,
mom!

02:41.521 --> 02:44.820
Why didn't you love me?!

02:44.891 --> 02:47.519
Veringular... we're dropping
your calls on purpose,

02:47.593 --> 02:50.221
and there isn't shit you can
do about it.

02:50.296 --> 02:52.196
Happy birthday, son!

02:52.265 --> 02:53.493
Wow!

02:53.566 --> 02:55.830
<i>It's the mustang
I've always wanted!</i>

02:55.902 --> 02:56.834
Wow, dad!

02:56.903 --> 02:59.736
I can't believe that you...
Hey.

02:59.806 --> 03:01.774
Aw, dad, what'd you do that for?

03:01.841 --> 03:02.865
Wait, that's my car.

03:02.942 --> 03:03.874
Yours is over there.

03:03.943 --> 03:04.932
Oh...

03:05.011 --> 03:06.103
Aw!

03:06.779 --> 03:08.041
I've made a deal

03:08.114 --> 03:10.605
that will keep the empire out of
our affairs forever.

03:19.992 --> 03:23.587
We'd be honored if you could
join us.

03:46.552 --> 03:47.951
C-can I get a little more
water?

03:48.020 --> 03:48.952
What?

03:49.021 --> 03:50.181
Nothing!

03:50.256 --> 03:52.247
I just asked for more water.

03:55.728 --> 03:57.195
Hmm?

03:57.263 --> 03:58.195
Ckk!

03:58.264 --> 03:59.788
Rrr!

03:59.866 --> 04:01.060
Pkww!

04:06.773 --> 04:07.831
Rrr!

04:07.907 --> 04:09.465
So, how we doing?!

04:09.542 --> 04:11.567
Leia, how's the soup?

04:11.644 --> 04:12.906
You ever have soup this good?

04:12.979 --> 04:14.640
Yes, on Alderaan.

04:14.714 --> 04:19.413
<i>Hey, princess, let it go.</i>

04:21.286 --> 04:22.845
"Oh, help me!

04:22.922 --> 04:24.253
We're a peaceful planet!"

04:24.323 --> 04:25.847
"You may fire when ready."

04:25.925 --> 04:29.417
Boo-o-o-o-o-o-o-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!

04:29.495 --> 04:31.895
Big laser!
Pkk-k-k-k-k-k-k!

04:31.964 --> 04:34.091
Alderaan chunks everywhere!

04:34.167 --> 04:37.261
Ps-s-s-h-h-h-h-h-h-h!

04:40.139 --> 04:42.767
Anyone, uh...
anyone got a joke?

04:42.842 --> 04:44.104
I've got one.

04:44.177 --> 04:47.943
Who's got two thumbs and
betrayed his best friend?

04:48.014 --> 04:49.174
This guy!

04:51.617 --> 04:53.676
Uh... too soon?

04:53.753 --> 04:56.847
Well, it's been a time and a
half, but...

04:58.658 --> 05:00.387
Lot of torturing to do.

05:00.460 --> 05:02.257
A boo-oop bah boo!

05:02.328 --> 05:04.296
Doo deedle-dee doo doo!

05:04.363 --> 05:05.660
Aroo-oo!

05:08.000 --> 05:11.333
From the people who claim
"300" is a true story

05:11.404 --> 05:13.736
comes the tale of our nation's
birth.

05:13.806 --> 05:14.932
General Washington,

05:15.007 --> 05:17.976
the Redcoats outnumber us a
billion to 12!

05:18.044 --> 05:19.841
Fear not, American!

05:19.912 --> 05:24.713
For tonight, we dine...
in Virginia!

05:30.156 --> 05:33.648
King George would like to
speak with you.

05:33.726 --> 05:36.752
This is a British colony!

05:36.829 --> 05:37.989
British?

05:38.064 --> 05:41.090
This is America!

05:47.573 --> 05:49.564
Hancock, now!

05:59.785 --> 06:03.221
Y-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!

06:05.591 --> 06:09.789
It ain't accurate,
but it'll blow your fucking mind.

06:09.862 --> 06:13.354
And the power cell recharges
as it moves.

06:13.432 --> 06:16.560
It's a revolution
in robotic longevity!

06:16.636 --> 06:17.466
Yes?

06:17.537 --> 06:18.663
Can you fuck it?

06:18.738 --> 06:19.670
Excuse me?

06:19.739 --> 06:21.866
Can you fuck it?

06:21.941 --> 06:22.771
No.

06:22.842 --> 06:25.037
Oh, jeez! Come on!

06:25.111 --> 06:27.636
Tragedy struck today as
beloved children's icon

06:27.713 --> 06:30.614
Raggedy Ann committed suicide
by steam press.

06:30.683 --> 06:33.277
Viewers will remember that her
longtime companion,

06:33.352 --> 06:35.320
Raggedy Andy,
died in the late '80s

06:35.388 --> 06:39.119
and is now a permanent part of
the AIDS quilt.

06:39.191 --> 06:40.453
All too common.

06:40.526 --> 06:42.585
While boys hang on to action
figures forever,

06:42.662 --> 06:45.597
girls dump their old playthings
with a cruel lack of compassion.

06:45.665 --> 06:47.292
But enough about
my personal life.

06:47.366 --> 06:49.926
What happens to girls' toys when
they're no longer loved?

06:50.002 --> 06:53.301
Jem was on top of the rock 'n'
roll world in the '80s,

06:53.372 --> 06:55.897
but when she fell,
she fell hard...

06:55.975 --> 06:57.636
some say right into a
cheesecake.

06:57.710 --> 07:00.907
# The wheels on the bus go
quack quack quack #

07:00.980 --> 07:02.504
# Open and shut #

07:02.582 --> 07:04.140
# Beep beep beep #

07:04.216 --> 07:07.344
# The driver on the bus goes
swish swish open quack #

07:07.420 --> 07:09.217
# Bus beep beep #

07:09.288 --> 07:10.414
# That's how it goes #

07:10.489 --> 07:11.751
No, they don't!

07:11.824 --> 07:15.123
You're ruining my party!

07:15.194 --> 07:18.095
# Little stupid bitch better
shut the fuck up #

07:18.164 --> 07:21.600
You want to know what's truly,
truly outrageous?

07:21.667 --> 07:23.134
Chlamydia.

07:23.202 --> 07:24.533
$40, right?

07:24.604 --> 07:26.595
You know, this is really
embarrassing, but in the '80s,

07:26.672 --> 07:28.799
I used to masturbate to you all
the time.

07:28.874 --> 07:30.432
Yeah, you were just a boy then,

07:30.509 --> 07:33.239
but now you're a man,
right?

07:33.312 --> 07:35.337
Well, yes... a married man.

07:35.414 --> 07:37.405
So, is it an open marriage
or...

07:49.161 --> 07:51.356
So, is it an open marriage?

07:51.430 --> 07:53.625
The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
briefly added

07:53.699 --> 07:57.601
a fifth member with a very
special accessory... a vagina.

07:57.670 --> 07:59.467
But after getting dumped from
the team,

07:59.538 --> 08:00.971
Venus chose to end her life

08:01.040 --> 08:03.338
the way all discarded
turtles meet their maker.

08:03.409 --> 08:04.637
Seen it a million times...

08:04.710 --> 08:06.473
tried to flush herself down the
toilet.

08:06.545 --> 08:09.480
Ironically, when she died,
she crapped herself.

08:09.548 --> 08:11.345
Is that ironic or just funny?

08:11.417 --> 08:13.180
Strawberry Shortcake
was bullied

08:13.252 --> 08:15.379
for years by the evil
Purple Pieman.

08:15.454 --> 08:16.751
Now, for the first time,

08:16.822 --> 08:18.653
she'll get to confront her
former tormentor.

08:19.859 --> 08:20.883
Eh?

08:20.960 --> 08:22.325
Who's there?

08:22.395 --> 08:23.987
I am blind now.

08:24.063 --> 08:26.725
The diabetes saw to that.

08:26.799 --> 08:29.233
Cha-cha-cha cha.

08:29.301 --> 08:30.996
Still got the moves, ha ha.

08:31.070 --> 08:32.503
And so Strawberry Shortcake

08:32.571 --> 08:34.903
has been denied the
confrontation she so craves.

08:34.974 --> 08:35.941
Oh, no!

08:36.008 --> 08:36.996
Bull crap!

08:37.076 --> 08:38.736
Aah!

08:38.811 --> 08:39.640
What the...

08:39.712 --> 08:40.542
Fucker!

08:40.613 --> 08:41.909
Aah!

08:41.981 --> 08:44.677
Motherfucker,
take my berries now, bitch!

08:44.750 --> 08:45.717
Yaah!

08:46.786 --> 08:48.913
Whoo!

08:48.988 --> 08:51.047
I told that motherfucker I'd
bury him,

08:51.123 --> 08:54.388
and that's not some
fruit-related speech impediment.

08:54.460 --> 08:59.261
B-u-r-y... bury, like in the
fucking ground.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.390
Rainbow Brite was a huge hit
with girls...

09:01.467 --> 09:03.162
and boys who
wanted to be girls.

09:03.235 --> 09:04.827
So, Rainbow,
what have you been up to?

09:04.904 --> 09:07.532
Well, after I retired as
ruler of Rainbow Land,

09:07.606 --> 09:10.700
I continued to seek out all the
pretty colors of the world.

09:10.776 --> 09:13.745
I dated a black guy, a Korean
guy, a black guy,

09:13.813 --> 09:16.611
a Puerto Rican guy, a black guy,
some Indian guys...

09:16.682 --> 09:20.049
dot and feather... a
black guy, a black guy... oh,

09:20.119 --> 09:23.054
another black guy... daddy was
so pissed.

09:23.122 --> 09:25.647
And how does Sailor Moon make
a living these days?

09:25.725 --> 09:28.626
I sell my used panties to old
men online.

09:28.694 --> 09:31.857
It's a tragedy when a beloved
icon is discarded on purpose.

09:31.931 --> 09:33.364
We Cabbage Patch people were
abandoned

09:33.432 --> 09:36.959
as soon as we grew out of our
cute baby stage.

09:37.036 --> 09:38.833
Adoption, my asshole.

09:38.904 --> 09:40.394
With nobody to care for them,

09:40.473 --> 09:44.068
the Cabbage Patch community fell
on hard times.

09:44.143 --> 09:46.907
Perhaps the greatest tragedy of
all befell Chatty Cathy.

09:46.979 --> 09:48.276
After witnessing a mob crime,

09:48.347 --> 09:50.542
the mafia tried to make sure she
couldn't talk.

09:50.616 --> 09:52.311
They cut out my tongue,

09:52.384 --> 09:55.649
but I would not be
intimidated.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.689
I testified anyway.

09:57.757 --> 09:59.054
Oh, good for you.

09:59.125 --> 10:02.322
I wish I was dead.

10:02.394 --> 10:05.056
Let's never again forget that
those girls' toys of yesteryear

10:05.131 --> 10:06.792
should be treated with the
dignity

10:06.866 --> 10:07.958
and respect that they deserve.

10:08.968 --> 10:10.265
Am I done yet?

10:10.336 --> 10:12.236
You'll know, Chatty Cathy.

10:12.304 --> 10:14.636
You'll know.

10:14.707 --> 10:17.039
