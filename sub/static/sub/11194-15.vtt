01:19.880 --> 01:22.760
Please... help me...

02:29.840 --> 02:31.760
(alarm)

02:38.240 --> 02:41.960
- Still no incoming signal, sir.
- All units are Earth side.

02:43.720 --> 02:45.960
Is it my eyes
or does that iris look kinda...?

02:46.120 --> 02:48.160
It's losing integrity.

02:53.320 --> 02:55.240
Hold fire!

03:08.280 --> 03:11.720
It's Schroedinger.
The cat I gave to the Tollan Narim.

03:11.880 --> 03:14.360
- A cat.
- The Tollan possess the technology...

03:14.520 --> 03:18.040
- ..to walk through solid matter.
- A technology which, by the way,...

03:18.200 --> 03:21.120
..they refused to share with us.

03:28.760 --> 03:32.040
General Hammond,
I am unfamiliar with Earth protocol.

03:32.520 --> 03:34.800
I sent Schroedinger
so you'd know I was a friend.

03:34.960 --> 03:38.920
It's all right, Narim. The Tollan
are welcome here. Units, stand down.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.760
Samantha...

03:51.200 --> 03:54.680
- It's good to see you again.
- It's good to see you too.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.520
What can we do for you, Narim?

04:00.880 --> 04:04.360
I am here to deliver a message
from our highest governing body.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.720
Colonel O'Neill.

04:07.120 --> 04:12.040
The Tollan curia request the presence
of you and your team for Triad.

04:12.200 --> 04:14.760
I feel like I'm being served.

04:15.640 --> 04:18.880
So, what exactly is this Triad?

04:19.040 --> 04:21.720
An ancient ceremony of justice.
Quite honourable.

04:21.880 --> 04:25.000
So, it's kinda like a tri-al.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.600
I am not familiar with "trial".

04:29.680 --> 04:34.960
Trial. It's like a tribunal. A place where
matters of justice and law are decided.

04:35.120 --> 04:38.280
Then, yes. A Triad is similar to your trial.

04:38.440 --> 04:40.640
So, who's on trial?

04:40.800 --> 04:43.400
- Ad.
- Tr... Triad.

04:44.320 --> 04:47.720
The decision the Triad must reach
is of concern to a friend of yours.

04:47.880 --> 04:50.600
- An Abydonian by the name of Skaara.
- What?

04:50.760 --> 04:53.600
- It is he who requested your presence.
- He's alive, he's OK?

04:53.760 --> 04:57.600
He is well.
But he does need your help for Triad.

04:58.040 --> 04:59.960
Where's this taking place?

05:00.120 --> 05:03.040
Our destination is
the new home world: Tollana.

05:03.200 --> 05:06.400
But we sent you to the Nox planet.
There wasn't a gate on Tollana.

05:06.560 --> 05:10.120
The Nox and the Tollan were able
to devise a way to get us there.

05:10.520 --> 05:14.200
- Of course you were.
- Way smarter than we are.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.680
- Very nice.
- So you built that...

05:35.040 --> 05:36.960
- ..Stargate?
- Yes.

05:37.840 --> 05:39.760
Way smarter than we are.

05:41.280 --> 05:43.200
Ours is bigger.

06:24.800 --> 06:28.360
- What just happened?
- Your weapons have been disabled.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.960
- What?
- They do not work.

06:32.120 --> 06:35.080
You may continue to
carry them if you wish.

06:36.160 --> 06:39.480
You don't think you should have
told us about this before we came?

06:39.640 --> 06:42.680
- I didn't find it relevant.
- We don't go to other planets...

06:42.840 --> 06:45.120
..without weapons to defend ourselves.

06:45.280 --> 06:47.680
What do you intend
to defend yourself against?

06:47.840 --> 06:51.520
- The Tollan have never threatened you.
- That is correct, O'Neill.

06:51.680 --> 06:54.280
I do not feel the need
to carry a weapon in this place.

06:54.440 --> 06:57.640
And, sir, judging by what I've seen
in the last five minutes,...

06:57.800 --> 07:01.480
..our weapons wouldn't be much of
a match for their technology anyway.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.120
No harm will come to you.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.760
The Tollan will guarantee it.

07:06.920 --> 07:11.080
Is that a "money back
if you're not completely alive" guarantee?

07:12.640 --> 07:14.560
This way.

07:41.200 --> 07:43.760
These must be our visitors from Earth.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.520
Welcome.

07:46.680 --> 07:49.440
High Chancellor Travell,
this is Colonel Jack O'Neill.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.400
Hi.

07:50.560 --> 07:52.840
Dr Daniel Jackson.
Major Samantha Carter.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.840
- Hello.
- And Teal'c.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.720
We are honoured that you have
agreed to participate in Triad.

07:58.880 --> 08:02.480
Your seeker will decide
which one of you will be archon.

08:04.920 --> 08:07.040
Seeker? Archon?

08:08.360 --> 08:09.720
Daniel?

08:09.880 --> 08:14.400
With respect, High Chancellor, Narim
didn't really explain the Triad very well.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.120
Could you please define
those terms for us?

08:17.280 --> 08:21.560
In Triad there are two
arguing parties called seekers.

08:21.720 --> 08:25.960
Triadic law requires one archon
who's sympathetic to each cause...

08:26.120 --> 08:27.800
..and one neutral archon.

08:28.080 --> 08:31.720
The archons argue the dispute
until a decision is reached.

08:31.880 --> 08:35.080
A seeker is like a defendant
and the archon is his attorney.

08:35.240 --> 08:37.159
I got it.

08:38.480 --> 08:40.600
So Skaara is our...

08:41.720 --> 08:43.640
- Seeker.
- ..seeker?

08:44.360 --> 08:46.680
Narim will take you to him now.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.760
This way.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.800
Skaara?

09:10.480 --> 09:12.480
(distorted) You.

09:12.640 --> 09:16.280
(distorted) You will pay
for what you did to my father.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.000
It's good to see you too.

09:27.480 --> 09:30.160
I'm very happy to see you. All of you.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.760
What's the deal? What just happened?

09:32.920 --> 09:38.160
The device about his chest suppresses
the Goa'uld's ability to silence his host.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.080
The Goa'uld and host
are free to speak at will.

09:41.240 --> 09:44.840
The device cannot be removed as long
as Klorel and Skaara are our guests.

09:45.000 --> 09:48.120
The indicator prevents one
from pretending to be the other.

09:48.280 --> 09:51.080
Red indicates it is Klorel who speaks.
Blue, Skaara.

09:51.240 --> 09:54.000
Nice device. We'll take a dozen.

09:55.160 --> 09:57.160
As you may recall from last time,...

09:57.320 --> 10:01.400
..it is forbidden for the Tollan to give our
technology to a less-advanced culture.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.000
Still got that arrogance bug, I see.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.720
It is l, O'Neill.

10:06.880 --> 10:09.200
Are you not happy to see me?

10:16.640 --> 10:18.560
Yeah.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.520
It's good to see you.

10:21.680 --> 10:23.600
I knew you would come.

10:23.760 --> 10:26.880
Soon, with your help,
I'll be free of this demon.

10:27.040 --> 10:29.080
Every day I fight him.

10:29.240 --> 10:31.360
I listen. I learn.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.600
It is time for Skaara to choose his archon.

10:38.400 --> 10:40.320
O'Neill is strong.

10:40.880 --> 10:42.800
Daniel is wise.

10:44.680 --> 10:47.760
- May I not choose both?
- You may. They may both argue.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.480
However, they will have but one vote.

10:51.400 --> 10:55.240
OK. What's this Triad about?
What's to be decided?

10:55.400 --> 10:58.960
Two days ago, a small Goa'uld vessel
crashed in a remote area.

10:59.120 --> 11:01.720
The occupant was badly injured.
It was Skaara.

11:01.880 --> 11:04.280
We were fleeing a battle group
sent by Heru-ur.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.400
My demon knew the Tollans
would stop them.

11:06.560 --> 11:08.480
Which we did.

11:09.040 --> 11:11.360
We warned them, but they came anyway.

11:12.240 --> 11:15.120
Our defence grid
was forced to destroy them.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.440
- So, Heru-ur is dead?
- No.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.720
But two of his mother ships
are destroyed.

11:22.880 --> 11:26.640
Wait a minute. You blew away
two Goa'uld mother ships?

11:27.000 --> 11:29.560
We are not a warring people.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.760
But our defensive technology
is far advanced of the Goa'uld's.

11:32.920 --> 11:37.240
This weapons chatter gets my blood
pumping. Can we get back to the Triad?

11:37.400 --> 11:41.000
Yes, of course. When our sentries
reached the crashed vessel,...

11:41.160 --> 11:45.600
..Skaara asked us to free him
of his Goa'uld. But the Goa'uld refuses.

11:45.760 --> 11:49.360
Under Tollan law we have no choice but
to hear both arguments before acting.

11:49.520 --> 11:51.080
- And Klorel's...
- Archon.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.160
..archon is who?

12:13.920 --> 12:18.960
My Lord Zipacna, we are honoured that
you have agreed to participate in Triad.

12:19.120 --> 12:24.680
Due to your dispatch of Heru-ur's mother
ships, it appears I do not have a choice.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.720
- (Klorel) We would speak in private.
- As you wish.

12:46.960 --> 12:48.880
So...

12:49.480 --> 12:54.400
..when you were trying to get us to
come here and then... disarmed us,...

12:54.560 --> 12:58.280
..you didn't feel it appropriate to mention
a freakin' Goa'uld would be here?

12:58.440 --> 13:01.800
- Not to mention his associates?
- They are as unarmed as you.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.440
- You sure of that?
- Our technology disables any weaponry.

13:05.600 --> 13:07.080
Uh-huh.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.680
You said there was a third neutral archon.
That's... a Tollan?

13:10.840 --> 13:16.520
No. We have asked our friends to send
someone capable of remaining neutral.

13:16.680 --> 13:18.600
I believe you have met.

13:26.640 --> 13:30.920
- Lya.
- It is good to see you once again, friends.

13:34.160 --> 13:37.200
Well, this just became a piece of cake,
a day at the beach!

13:37.360 --> 13:39.960
An accident waiting for a place to happen.

13:41.040 --> 13:42.960
Mr Negative.

13:43.680 --> 13:47.640
- Yes.
- Sir, what makes you so confident?

13:47.800 --> 13:52.720
Because Lya is a fair and insightful
person who will vote our way.

13:52.880 --> 13:54.920
Besides, she likes us.

13:55.080 --> 13:58.400
Lya likes everyone. That's the Nox way.

13:58.560 --> 14:01.400
The Nox are not in conflict
with the Goa'uld.

14:01.560 --> 14:04.480
They saved Apophis
when you attempted to eliminate him.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.880
So, what do we have
on this fine Goa'uld fella?

14:08.040 --> 14:10.760
Zipacna was one of Apophis's
most loyal underlords.

14:10.920 --> 14:14.960
I don't believe for a second
he's come to talk Klorel outta here.

14:15.120 --> 14:17.280
(tinkling)

14:20.120 --> 14:23.000
- They are ready for you.
- Thank you.

14:26.120 --> 14:28.880
Carter, you and Teal'c
keep an eye on Zippy's kids.

14:29.040 --> 14:31.360
- Yes, sir.
- See what they're up to.

14:36.440 --> 14:41.560
This dispute involves two sentient
beings who inhabit the same body.

14:41.720 --> 14:43.880
Both have requested
sole use of the body,...

14:44.040 --> 14:47.840
..therefore we must establish
right of priority over the body.

14:48.000 --> 14:49.920
To whom does it belong?

14:50.080 --> 14:53.040
Ostensibly, the one to whom it was born.

14:54.120 --> 14:58.200
Your Eminence, I must request that
the human contingent follow decorum...

14:58.360 --> 15:01.800
..appropriate to such
an auspicious body as this one.

15:01.960 --> 15:06.280
I agree. The archons will refrain
from questions or comments...

15:06.440 --> 15:09.480
..until their side is acknowledged.

15:09.640 --> 15:13.200
At this time I recognise
Lord Zipacna and Klorel.

15:14.000 --> 15:18.760
Until three years ago, the humans
on Abydos lived under Goa'uld law,...

15:19.400 --> 15:23.840
..administered by Ra. Now, by that law,
they were Goa'uld property.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.400
Lord Klorel merely took
what was already his.

15:26.560 --> 15:28.920
- By force.
- Colonel O'Neill, please.

15:29.080 --> 15:30.440
Sorry. Sorry.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.440
I understand your desire
to defend your position,...

15:33.600 --> 15:35.960
..and I will give you that opportunity.

15:36.120 --> 15:39.080
I would first like to hear
Skaara's perspective.

15:53.640 --> 15:55.960
I was born to this body,...

15:56.960 --> 15:59.720
..free of the demon Klorel.

15:59.880 --> 16:02.080
He stole my body.

16:02.240 --> 16:05.280
On Abydos I would have married,...

16:06.400 --> 16:08.240
..had children,...

16:08.400 --> 16:10.720
..grown old and died.

16:12.120 --> 16:15.440
The Goa'uld took more than my body.

16:16.440 --> 16:18.360
He stole my life.

16:20.840 --> 16:22.760
Human archons.

16:30.120 --> 16:34.480
Skaara, when you were born,
did your people believe they were slaves?

16:34.920 --> 16:36.240
No.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.800
Just so we can all be clear, who was Ra?

16:39.680 --> 16:42.240
We believed him to be an evil god.

16:42.360 --> 16:46.080
So he enslaved your people
through superstition and fear?

16:46.880 --> 16:49.800
Until you came, yes.

17:14.560 --> 17:18.359
Tell me, do the people of Abydos hunt?

17:21.000 --> 17:22.319
Yes.

17:22.480 --> 17:28.680
Do they also use animals as beasts
of burden? For food? For clothing?

17:30.480 --> 17:32.400
Yes.

17:35.680 --> 17:39.520
- Do you also eat the flesh of humans?
- No! Never!

17:39.680 --> 17:42.760
You make judgment that animals
are of lesser value than humans.

17:42.920 --> 17:46.080
We care for our animals.
We worship them.

17:46.240 --> 17:51.560
- We thank them for the gifts they give us.
- Yes, but you keep them to do your will.

17:51.720 --> 17:55.120
- And you kill them to survive.
- When we have the need.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.960
As we do with humans...
when we have the need.

18:02.000 --> 18:05.520
If a human has the right to take an animal
and do with it as he pleases...

18:05.680 --> 18:10.800
..because he is a superior being...
then so does a Goa'uld.

18:12.040 --> 18:16.040
And by that argument alone,
the Goa'uld has priority.

18:17.880 --> 18:19.960
And the host belongs to Klorel.

18:26.440 --> 18:30.920
- Do the human archons wish to respond?
- Yes, ma'am. You betcha.

18:31.760 --> 18:33.680
We do, Your Eminence.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.840
Can I go first?

18:41.360 --> 18:45.240
Your argument is flawed
in oh so many ways.

18:47.800 --> 18:50.920
Humans are self-aware. Animals aren't.

18:51.520 --> 18:55.600
Animals are not because
you deem them not to be.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.920
Just as we deem humans not to be.

18:59.960 --> 19:03.600
What we mean is that humans
have a more advanced intelligence...

19:03.760 --> 19:08.120
- ..than lower caste animals.
- Exactly. Just like that.

19:08.280 --> 19:10.440
Is that not a matter of perspective?

19:10.600 --> 19:15.160
Just like a human considers itself
more intelligent than a pig,...

19:15.320 --> 19:19.040
..might a pig consider itself
more intelligent than a rat?

19:19.200 --> 19:22.000
Speaking of rats... What's your point?

19:22.600 --> 19:26.640
My point is that the Goa'uld consider
ourselves more intelligent than humans.

19:26.800 --> 19:30.840
Our technology is more advanced,
our mere knowledge of the universe...

19:31.280 --> 19:35.720
- ..is more advanced than yours.
- You stole that knowledge!

19:38.720 --> 19:43.320
You took human knowledge
when you took humans as hosts.

19:43.600 --> 19:46.920
Just as you took knowledge
from other species.

19:48.080 --> 19:52.040
The Stargate isn't your technology.
You just... you took that.

19:52.200 --> 19:57.560
As far as we know...
nothing you have came from you,...

19:57.720 --> 20:03.000
..so clearly the evidence is not that you're
more intelligent, just more parasitic.

20:04.360 --> 20:07.880
The method of gaining
the knowledge is not in question.

20:08.720 --> 20:11.080
We were able to obtain it. You were not.

20:11.360 --> 20:13.040
Oh, please.

20:13.200 --> 20:17.640
Gentlemen, we seem to have
wandered away from the central topic.

20:18.360 --> 20:21.320
Which seeker has priority over this body?

20:21.480 --> 20:24.240
I don't think we ventured away
from the central topic.

20:24.400 --> 20:29.520
What we're trying to point out is that
the Goa'uld steal what they possess.

20:29.640 --> 20:32.800
As they have, in fact,
stolen Skaara's body.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.920
Can l... Sorry, Daniel.
Can I say something?

20:42.240 --> 20:44.160
Skaara.

20:45.160 --> 20:49.920
You once told me you'd rather die...
than live another day as a Goa'uld.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.840
Why?

20:55.760 --> 20:59.160
What I suffer each day
is worse than death.

21:03.520 --> 21:05.440
For example?

21:06.640 --> 21:08.560
I remember the demon...

21:09.120 --> 21:12.160
..stretching out my hand to kill Daniel,...

21:13.880 --> 21:16.560
..the husband of my sister.

21:16.720 --> 21:19.160
There was nothing I could do to stop it.

21:26.440 --> 21:31.880
And I have seen many more...
far worse atrocities than this.

21:32.040 --> 21:35.080
- I demand that the human stay on topic!
- It is on topic!

21:35.240 --> 21:39.680
You just wanna avoid talking about
all the nasty stuff he's witnessed.

21:39.840 --> 21:42.080
The host witnesses nothing.

21:42.240 --> 21:44.800
Since nothing of the host survives.

22:00.440 --> 22:02.560
What are they doing?

22:04.080 --> 22:06.000
I am uncertain.

22:19.680 --> 22:22.280
Lord Zipacna,
I'd like to ask you a question, if I may.

22:22.440 --> 22:25.360
- I hope I have the answer.
- I'm sure you will.

22:30.600 --> 22:33.160
Is your host...

22:34.440 --> 22:37.120
..in there somewhere?

22:37.280 --> 22:39.720
Nothing of the host survives.

22:39.960 --> 22:43.080
Really? Then how do you explain Skaara?

22:45.040 --> 22:47.920
What you call Skaara
is nothing but a remnant.

22:48.840 --> 22:51.120
He can speak now
only because the Tollan...

22:51.280 --> 22:53.880
..used their technology to silence Klorel.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.920
But how could he speak at all
if he hadn't survived?

22:57.080 --> 23:01.960
And he spoke well. His words were
not those of a remnant personality.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.480
Carter?

23:14.640 --> 23:17.200
- Sir, we may have a problem.
- Do tell.

23:17.320 --> 23:21.120
We tracked a serpent guard and two Jaffa
to just outside the city limits.

23:21.280 --> 23:23.720
We observed them locate
six Tollan weapon sites.

23:23.880 --> 23:26.240
We think they were disabling them, sir.

23:26.400 --> 23:29.760
Which means Zipacna
is using the Triad to stall for time...

23:29.920 --> 23:32.240
..so his men can disable
the Tollan defences.

23:32.400 --> 23:35.720
- Then take the opportunity to...
- Wipe out the Tollan.

23:50.320 --> 23:53.080
Samantha, I hope you've not waited long.

23:53.240 --> 23:56.400
- No. Thank you for coming.
- It's my pleasure.

23:56.560 --> 24:00.440
In fact, I'm pleased that
we can finally be alone together.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.000
I asked you to meet me
because I need your help.

24:03.160 --> 24:05.080
Samantha, l...

24:07.200 --> 24:09.520
I have missed you.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.760
A lot's happened to me
since I last saw you.

24:15.520 --> 24:17.880
- There is another.
- No.

24:18.040 --> 24:20.640
Not in the way that you mean.

24:20.800 --> 24:24.560
You see, I was blended with a Tok'ra,
and she died to save my life,...

24:24.720 --> 24:27.120
..but I still have
her memories and feelings.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.400
- And she is part of you?
- Yes.

24:31.160 --> 24:35.320
I can't have a relationship with anyone
until I'm absolutely sure whose feelings...

24:35.480 --> 24:38.360
..l'm feeling. Do you understand?

24:40.720 --> 24:43.280
You are very wise, Samantha.

24:45.560 --> 24:48.120
May I ask, then, why you summoned me?

24:48.280 --> 24:51.480
Teal'c and I followed the Jaffa
that came with the Goa'uld.

24:51.640 --> 24:55.080
Why would you do that? I was sure
your people were more diplomatic.

24:55.240 --> 24:57.720
We did it out of concern for your people.

24:57.880 --> 25:00.480
We think the Goa'uld are
using the Triad to buy time...

25:00.640 --> 25:03.440
..so that they can prepare
for an attack on Tollana.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.400
- Why do you think that?
- They tampered with your weapons.

25:06.560 --> 25:09.400
Impossible.
They are made of an impenetrable alloy...

25:09.560 --> 25:12.120
- ..and protected by security codes.
- Narim,...

25:12.240 --> 25:14.800
..they were doing something to them.

25:18.800 --> 25:21.800
We asked Lord Zipacna
about your accusation.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.600
He denied it and he was quite offended.

25:24.840 --> 25:29.400
Well, that's a shocker.
I hope you didn't take his word for it.

25:30.040 --> 25:35.280
Our experts have been unable to find any
form of tampering on any of the cannons.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.040
Carter?

25:37.200 --> 25:40.800
- Maybe they were painting them, sir.
- I see no paint.

25:40.960 --> 25:44.760
Sorry. It's an Earth military expression.
It means marking them as targets.

25:44.920 --> 25:47.920
Nor do I see any markings.

25:48.760 --> 25:52.280
There are ways they can target
the weapons without leaving a mark.

25:52.440 --> 25:55.840
If so, the instant
one of these cannons is attacked,...

25:56.000 --> 26:00.720
..the rest will automatically locate the
position of the attacker and destroy it.

26:00.880 --> 26:04.080
Unless they're all taken out
simultaneously.

26:04.560 --> 26:07.560
If that were possible,
why did the Goa'uld Heru-ur...

26:07.720 --> 26:10.280
..not do so when he pursued Klorel?

26:10.600 --> 26:15.120
Maybe he didn't have a contingent on the
planet targeting the weapons in advance.

26:15.280 --> 26:18.560
He didn't do it because it is impossible.

26:18.720 --> 26:23.400
It would take but one of these devices to
protect us from a Goa'uld mother ship,...

26:23.560 --> 26:25.480
..and we have many more than that.

26:25.640 --> 26:30.240
Our technology is superior
in every way to theirs... and to yours.

26:30.400 --> 26:32.960
My, aren't we cocky?

26:33.480 --> 26:37.960
Colonel, if this is an attempt
to influence the outcome of Triad,...

26:38.120 --> 26:40.800
..it is a feeble attempt indeed.

26:41.560 --> 26:45.400
This is not intended as anything other
than an attempt to help your people.

26:45.560 --> 26:51.840
I hope so. But understand, if you continue
to pursue this matter in any way,...

26:52.160 --> 26:55.120
..l will disqualify you
from Triad and replace you.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.800
Skaara will be represented
by someone else. Is that understood?

26:58.960 --> 27:01.800
- With protest.
- Now,...

27:01.960 --> 27:04.640
..you will return to Triad in the morning...

27:04.800 --> 27:08.120
..and you will not mention
this matter any further.

27:17.880 --> 27:21.600
Just stay away from Zippy
and his gaggle of Goa'ulds, OK?

27:21.760 --> 27:24.600
I know the Goa'uld, O'Neill.
They will attack.

27:24.760 --> 27:26.800
But I don't see a choice here.

27:26.960 --> 27:30.480
If we pursue the issue, Skaara will be
represented by God knows who,...

27:30.640 --> 27:34.800
..then we won't stand a chance in hell.
I'm not gonna let that happen.

27:34.960 --> 27:37.600
I must disagree with you
in this situation, O'Neill.

27:37.760 --> 27:40.680
We are faced with the loss of Skaara -
one individual -

27:40.840 --> 27:43.960
versus the death of many Tollan.
And possibly ourselves.

27:44.120 --> 27:48.480
That's assuming the Tollan can't defend
themselves, which is a false assumption.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.440
They did bring down two mother ships.
I think they'll be OK.

27:51.600 --> 27:54.880
The Tollan have not been at war
in many generations.

27:55.040 --> 27:59.440
They do not think strategically.
I believe that to be a fatal flaw.

28:00.640 --> 28:04.440
- Their naivete could be their downfall.
- That is correct.

28:07.640 --> 28:12.440
Allow Major Carter and myself to continue
monitoring the Goa'ulds in case of...

28:13.000 --> 28:14.920
Excuse my interruption.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.000
The Triad resumes.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.560
You've got your orders. Stand down.

28:34.640 --> 28:36.560
Teal'c.

28:38.240 --> 28:41.840
This is highly inappropriate of you
to come to me during Triad.

28:42.000 --> 28:46.720
I assure you that I would never intend
to influence your decision in any way.

28:46.880 --> 28:50.200
I wish to speak to you
concerning another matter.

28:50.360 --> 28:53.200
You must not mention Klorel or Skaara.

28:53.360 --> 28:56.360
If you do, I will be forced
to report the matter to the Tollan.

28:56.520 --> 28:58.440
Understood.

28:59.160 --> 29:01.400
What is it, then?

29:01.560 --> 29:04.640
As you are aware, I was formerly
in the service of the Goa'uld.

29:04.800 --> 29:07.880
If this is designed to bias me
against the Goa'uld...

29:08.040 --> 29:11.680
I would never do such a thing,
nor do I feel the need.

29:11.840 --> 29:16.240
I am here in direct violation
of an order given by Colonel O'Neill.

29:16.400 --> 29:19.280
- Go on.
- I am convinced that the Goa'uld...

29:19.440 --> 29:23.600
..are planning to destroy all the Tollan
weapon installations simultaneously...

29:23.760 --> 29:26.840
..thereby preventing them
from ever returning fire.

29:27.000 --> 29:31.000
The Goa'uld will then attack this world
which will be defenceless.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.480
Why do you tell me this?

29:34.360 --> 29:39.360
I believe that you and I are the only ones
capable of preventing this tragedy.

29:39.520 --> 29:45.720
You and l? Teal'c, you are
a strong warrior, but I am of the Nox.

29:45.880 --> 29:49.280
If you've learned anything of us,
you know that we defend ourselves...

29:49.440 --> 29:52.480
..through illusion
and mastery of the mind.

29:52.640 --> 29:55.200
Precisely.

30:11.160 --> 30:13.800
I apologise for my tardiness.

30:15.520 --> 30:17.720
We will resume.

30:17.880 --> 30:20.800
Lord Zipacna has asked us
to reconvene early...

30:20.960 --> 30:24.000
..because he wishes to make a challenge.

30:35.640 --> 30:40.160
Tollan law does not provide
for a penalty of death. Is that correct?

30:41.360 --> 30:43.040
It is.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.640
Then I wish to point out
the futility of this Triad.

30:47.760 --> 30:53.040
A Goa'uld needs a host to survive. This is
a biological fact beyond our control.

30:53.960 --> 30:59.600
If you award priority to Skaara,
then it is as a death sentence for Klorel.

31:00.320 --> 31:04.280
Of course, if you flip that around,
you got Skaara on death row.

31:04.440 --> 31:06.160
Yes.

31:06.320 --> 31:10.080
But as you proved earlier in Triad,
the host survives.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.240
Yeah...

31:14.400 --> 31:16.400
We concede this point.

31:16.560 --> 31:22.440
Therefore, if you award priority to Klorel,
both host and symbiote live.

31:25.720 --> 31:29.440
Yeah. One lives freely.
The other lives as a slave.

31:31.440 --> 31:34.800
We would put forth that life
as a slave is not life at all.

31:34.960 --> 31:39.440
And if you wanna save both lives,
give us Skaara and you take Klorel.

31:41.480 --> 31:45.400
The Tok'ra can put him
in another host for all I care.

31:46.280 --> 31:49.200
Who, Colonel?
Perhaps you would volunteer?

31:49.360 --> 31:51.280
Uh...

31:51.880 --> 31:53.080
No.

31:53.240 --> 31:57.680
Perhaps you could find someone
who would choose to be a host.

32:03.080 --> 32:08.000
Narim, what is the meaning of this? You
know Triad is held as a closed session.

32:09.760 --> 32:14.480
Your Eminence, please adjust
your viewer to the orbital observatory.

32:17.920 --> 32:20.520
A Goa'uld mother ship?

32:21.240 --> 32:23.160
Yes. It approaches Tollana.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.360
Explain.

32:35.520 --> 32:38.880
My vessel comes in anticipation
of our victory in Triad.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.320
It is merely coming to take us along.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.800
Why not take a Stargate
like the rest of us?

32:44.960 --> 32:49.200
Not that it is of your concern, but
there is no Chaapa-ai where we are going.

32:49.360 --> 32:52.200
Then gate to where there is one
and get picked up.

32:52.360 --> 32:56.240
Your Eminence, if our intentions were
hostile, we would have attacked already.

32:56.400 --> 33:01.400
Even so, your ship's arrival is premature
and in violation of Tollan space.

33:03.320 --> 33:06.960
I must warn you that
if your ship moves any closer...

33:07.120 --> 33:12.280
..before the conclusion of Triad, our
automated defence system will destroy it.

33:12.440 --> 33:17.400
The Goa'uld rest our case and we are
prepared to vote. Therefore, Triad is over.

33:17.560 --> 33:22.360
Triad is over when all parties agree,
Lord Zipacna.

33:25.600 --> 33:28.240
Do the human archons
have any further arguments?

33:28.400 --> 33:32.960
Nope. I think the Goa'uld
made our case for us quite nicely.

33:35.200 --> 33:39.120
No further arguments, Your Eminence.
We are prepared to vote.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.800
Nox archon?

33:42.440 --> 33:44.720
Yes.

33:44.880 --> 33:46.880
Then bring in the seekers.

34:20.880 --> 34:25.040
Klorel and Skaara,
you can both hear the Triad's ruling?

34:25.560 --> 34:27.480
Yes, Your Eminence.

34:32.800 --> 34:34.480
(Klorel) I can.

34:34.639 --> 34:37.440
Human archons, may we hear your vote?

34:40.440 --> 34:42.760
We find in favour of Skaara.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.199
Goa'uld archon.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.679
In favour of Klorel.

34:56.960 --> 34:58.800
Big surprise there.

34:58.960 --> 35:00.880
Nox archon?

35:09.400 --> 35:11.720
After careful consideration,...

35:11.880 --> 35:16.280
..l believe that both Klorel
and Skaara have the right to live.

35:17.000 --> 35:21.560
But living as a host,
with no will of one's own, is not life.

35:21.720 --> 35:24.640
Therefore,
only one may remain in the body.

35:25.320 --> 35:29.840
To that end, I award priority
to the original owner of the body.

35:31.680 --> 35:32.600
Skaara.

35:32.760 --> 35:35.560
Yes! Now get that mother ship outta here.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.680
We will summon the Tok'ra
to come to Tollana...

35:38.840 --> 35:42.360
..to assist in the removal
of the Goa'uld Klorel.

35:43.600 --> 35:46.200
He will be removed from the host,...

35:46.360 --> 35:50.920
..and, if he survives, will be sent to
the Goa'uld world of his choice.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.520
I have locked the detachment device.

36:03.080 --> 36:08.120
Skaara, you have priority control
until the Goa'uld is removed.

36:08.280 --> 36:10.000
Prepare yourself.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.760
The Tok'ra will arrive as soon as possible.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.440
And congratulations.

36:15.600 --> 36:17.520
Thank you.

36:18.600 --> 36:21.640
Lord Zipacna, you are dismissed...

36:22.920 --> 36:24.840
..with our thanks.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.240
Ha'tak.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.240
Ree nok, Ha'tak.

36:42.040 --> 36:43.960
Hey!

36:51.800 --> 36:54.120
Nice. Let's go!

36:57.600 --> 36:59.520
(alarm)

37:00.160 --> 37:02.720
Skaara, wait here. Just trust me.

37:04.320 --> 37:09.560
How's that superior technology looking?
Security system serving you pretty good?

37:13.520 --> 37:15.880
- The ion cannons.
- Got a dead lock on all of 'em.

37:16.040 --> 37:19.040
I hate when people
waste my time like this.

37:21.160 --> 37:23.440
Where's Teal'c?

37:26.160 --> 37:28.080
Colonel!

37:28.440 --> 37:30.360
Cover!

37:38.400 --> 37:42.240
- I must inform Travell.
- Zipacna's escaped through the Stargate.

37:42.800 --> 37:46.520
Well, that's the least of our prob...
Where have you been?

37:46.680 --> 37:50.640
I must inform you that I have disregarded
your orders concerning the Goa'uld.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.920
Please explain.

38:01.760 --> 38:05.560
- So what's going on here?
- I have requested Lya's assistance.

38:12.640 --> 38:15.640
- You hid one of them.
- That is correct.

38:15.800 --> 38:21.360
Travell explained it would take but one
of these to destroy a Goa'uld mother ship.

38:24.080 --> 38:26.400
It should have already fired.

38:28.160 --> 38:30.080
Well, it hasn't.

38:31.200 --> 38:33.120
Let's take cover, huh?

39:21.640 --> 39:23.560
Very nice.

39:31.480 --> 39:33.800
You disregarded my warnings.

39:35.360 --> 39:37.480
Mine, too. Well done.

39:38.680 --> 39:41.840
If you were my subject,
I would be forced to discipline you.

39:42.000 --> 39:45.000
However, you are not one of my subjects.

39:46.120 --> 39:49.640
It could not have been done
without the assistance of Lya.

39:50.640 --> 39:52.960
I thought the Nox were pacifists.

39:53.680 --> 39:56.440
I only hid the weapon. I did not fire it.

39:56.920 --> 39:58.360
Ah.

39:58.520 --> 40:00.840
Pretty fine line you didn't cross.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.680
Yes, it is.

40:03.840 --> 40:08.360
So, we basically
saved your whole planet, right?

40:08.760 --> 40:10.320
Yes.

40:11.080 --> 40:14.720
Are you therefore indebted to us
in any modest way?

40:16.560 --> 40:19.840
I suppose that is the case.

40:20.000 --> 40:24.120
So how about giving us the plans
to build one of those ion cannons?

40:24.280 --> 40:28.200
You have been told our policy.
That has not changed.

40:32.600 --> 40:34.880
The Tok'ra have
completed the procedure.

40:35.040 --> 40:36.960
Yeah?

40:38.840 --> 40:42.920
- What will become of Klorel?
- He will be sent to a Goa'uld world.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.400
- To hell with him...
- O'Neill!

40:53.120 --> 40:55.040
Much better.
