01:10.236 --> 01:12.534

Hey, guys, come on.
Just stay where you are, okay?

01:32.292 --> 01:36.126
My superiors say to let you
look at the flying saucer.

01:36.196 --> 01:38.255
It's not a flying saucer.

01:38.331 --> 01:40.663
It sure looks like one.

01:40.733 --> 01:43.497
Local kids dirt-biking.
Something shiny poking from the dirt.

01:43.570 --> 01:46.733
They dig it out, look in the window
and see aliens.

01:46.806 --> 01:50.674
- Did you look?
- Yes, ma'am. Then called for backup.

01:50.743 --> 01:53.712
- <i>[Booth] Uh, why?</i>
- On account of, well, they are aliens.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.276
All right.
[Grunts]

02:03.256 --> 02:05.247
You wanna take a look?

02:10.763 --> 02:12.731
Oh.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.733
<i>Are those what I think they are?</i>

02:14.801 --> 02:18.828
Yes. As long as you think
they're two adolescent human males.

02:18.905 --> 02:21.169
Mmm, how long?

02:21.241 --> 02:24.699
The amount of dehydrated
tissue suggests...

02:24.777 --> 02:27.211
<i>the tank is sealed and intact.</i>

02:27.280 --> 02:30.807
- <i>Years.</i>
- Man. Two kids, huh?

02:30.884 --> 02:33.682
I liked it better when they were aliens.

02:33.753 --> 02:36.688
One set of remains shows trauma
to the legs... compound fractures.

02:36.756 --> 02:38.690
And his pelvis
is broken in three places.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.692
The other is virtually untouched.

02:40.760 --> 02:43.888
- Cause of death?
- The amount of blood suggests
at least one of them bled out.

02:43.963 --> 02:46.557
Probably the one with the injuries.

02:46.633 --> 02:51.935
I've also noted a constellation of identical
non-metric variants. Extra foramina.

02:52.005 --> 02:55.031
<i>Does that mean they were twins?</i>

02:55.108 --> 02:58.271
- How did you know?
- Matthew and Ryan Kent.

02:58.344 --> 03:01.939
Kidnapped October 31, 2001.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.983
No one has seen 'em since.

03:39.819 --> 03:41.844
The remains in the beer vat...

03:41.921 --> 03:45.618
have been positively identified
as Matthew and Ryan Kent.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.626
Oh, God.

03:47.694 --> 03:49.628
Come on, Peter.
It's better than never knowing.

03:49.696 --> 03:52.756
Agent Sanders, you were assigned
to the Kent kidnapping?

03:52.832 --> 03:54.925
Uh, Mr. Sanders.

03:55.001 --> 03:57.026
I, uh, retired from the F.B. I...

03:57.103 --> 03:59.936
to pursue a career
in general contracting...

04:00.006 --> 04:01.940
uh, when I'm sober.

04:02.008 --> 04:05.774
Uh, Kim here was the assistant United States
attorney attached to the case.

04:05.845 --> 04:07.779
Still attached. The file's still open.

04:07.847 --> 04:10.111
<i>[Kim] The boys were snatched</i>
<i>after a drinking party.</i>

04:10.183 --> 04:12.310
Was the ransom paid?

04:12.385 --> 04:16.617
As the duly sworn representative
of the F.B. I...

04:16.689 --> 04:18.680
I advised Mr. Kent not to pay the ransom.

04:18.757 --> 04:21.988
Unfortunately, the Kents listened to me
and not the K & R guy...

04:22.060 --> 04:25.121
and, uh, now their sons are dead.

04:25.198 --> 04:28.964
- K & R?
- That's "kidnap and ransom" experts.

04:29.035 --> 04:31.663
The Kent boys were the Grave Digger's
third victims.

04:31.738 --> 04:34.400
Third of the six we know of.

04:34.474 --> 04:37.705
Uh, altogether,
four paid the ransom and lived.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.711
And the other one that didn't?

04:39.779 --> 04:43.044
- Never found him.
- That's why they call him the Grave Digger.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.313
He takes people, and he buries them.

04:46.386 --> 04:49.651
<i>You pay the ransom,</i>
<i>and he tells you how to dig 'em up.</i>

04:49.722 --> 04:53.158
You don't and, uh,
you never see 'em again.

04:54.994 --> 04:56.859
You won't catch him.

04:56.929 --> 04:59.363
With all due respect,
uh, Agent Sanders...

04:59.432 --> 05:02.162
we have the beer vat and human remains.

05:02.235 --> 05:05.033
What are two dead bodies gonna tell you
that four live victims couldn't?

05:05.104 --> 05:09.200
Dr. Brennan... she's pretty good at, uh,
making dead people tell her things.

05:09.275 --> 05:11.675
Look, my advice...
talk to the K & R guy.

05:11.744 --> 05:15.840
"Kidnap and ransom" expert,
Thomas Vega. Former F.B.I.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.042
<i>[Kim]</i>
<i>He literally wrote the book on the Grave Digger.</i>

05:19.419 --> 05:21.614
<i>I became a "kidnap and ransom" specialist...</i>

05:21.688 --> 05:24.657
after I realized that the Bureau's policy
on nonpayment to kidnappers...

05:24.724 --> 05:27.352
is antiquated and dangerous.

05:27.427 --> 05:29.554
You've dealt with
the Grave Digger how many times?

05:29.629 --> 05:32.325
- In total? Five.
- Janine is a journalist.

05:32.398 --> 05:34.525
She helped me write the book
on the Grave Digger.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.626
Next to me, she's the ranking
expert on that son of a bitch.

05:37.704 --> 05:39.695
Journalist, huh?

05:39.772 --> 05:41.899
Oh, don't be like that, Agent Booth.

05:43.042 --> 05:44.976
The Grave Digger is totally consistent.

05:45.044 --> 05:46.978
<i>No one ever sees the victim taken.</i>

05:47.046 --> 05:49.480
<i>The ransom demand is made using</i>
<i>a digitally altered voice.</i>

05:49.549 --> 05:52.882
<i>A time limit is given.</i>
<i>There's never a second call.</i>

05:52.952 --> 05:55.045
As soon as the ransom is paid...

05:55.121 --> 05:57.919
to a numbered untraceable account
in Bahrain, the Caribbean, et cetera...

05:57.990 --> 06:00.720
G.P.S. coordinates are provided
leading to the victim.

06:00.793 --> 06:03.227
None of the surviving victims
remembers anything before being taken?

06:03.296 --> 06:05.924
<i>Nothing. Burn marks</i>
<i>on the back of the neck...</i>

06:05.998 --> 06:09.126
suggests the use
of a stun gun or cattle prod.

06:09.202 --> 06:11.136
That'll scramble your brains pretty good.

06:11.204 --> 06:13.866
Also, when you try to trace whatever
container the boys were found in...

06:13.940 --> 06:15.771
well, you'll reach a dead end.

06:15.842 --> 06:18.333
He gets everything from
landfills or cash auctions.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.345
No last chance to pay up?

06:20.413 --> 06:22.347
Never.

06:22.415 --> 06:24.349
You know, most kidnappers are caught...

06:24.417 --> 06:26.681
because they start negotiating the ransom.

06:26.753 --> 06:28.584
The Grave Digger simply won't play.

06:28.654 --> 06:30.588
Really not looking to help you
write another book.

06:30.656 --> 06:32.920
You know, <i>Capturing the Grave Digger.</i>

06:32.992 --> 06:36.621
<i>Agent Booth, I have seen what this guy</i>
<i>does to families, up close.</i>

06:41.567 --> 06:43.831
You know what?
Dislike me as much as you want.

06:43.903 --> 06:47.862
But I'm still gonna help you
because I want this bastard caught.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.314
You were kind of mean to them.

06:56.382 --> 06:58.475
Yeah, thanks.

06:58.684 --> 07:02.643
Zack, did you catalog this anomaly
between C1 and C2 on Matthew?

07:02.722 --> 07:05.691
Yes. If you increase magnification
on the atlanto-axial joint...

07:05.758 --> 07:08.784
you'll see calcining
on the articular process.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.528
[Beeping]

07:13.599 --> 07:15.897
Bone burn.

07:15.968 --> 07:18.061
Yes. Over 300 degrees.

07:18.137 --> 07:20.071
Stun gun.

07:20.139 --> 07:22.300
Does the same mark
appear on Ryan?

07:22.375 --> 07:24.900
- No.
- Okay.

07:24.977 --> 07:29.914
Get the F.B.I. to send you photos and medical
exam results of the Grave Digger's victims.

07:29.982 --> 07:33.145
See if he uses
the same stun gun every time.

07:33.219 --> 07:35.187
Aluminum.

07:35.254 --> 07:40.021
- Aluminum?
- The Brits say aluminium,
but it sounds, well, British.

07:40.092 --> 07:42.652
Manganese alloy,
strain-hardened and stabilized.

07:42.728 --> 07:45.253
Traces on both sets of clothing.

07:45.331 --> 07:48.232
- From the vat?
- No. The inside of the vat is pure copper.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.599
Both boys' clothing was stained
with a sooty residue...

07:50.670 --> 07:55.266
- made up of lead and carbon,
benzene and aldehydes.
- Engine exhaust.

07:55.341 --> 07:58.037
Yeah. Particulates from lots of engines,
both gasoline and diesel.

07:59.111 --> 08:01.545
- Parking lot?
- <i>Underground probably.</i>

08:01.614 --> 08:03.946
Think that's where the Digger
grabs his victims?

08:04.016 --> 08:06.143
Compare your findings with the results...

08:06.219 --> 08:08.847
found on the clothing
of the surviving victims.

08:08.921 --> 08:10.889
See if they share anything in common.

08:10.957 --> 08:13.016
<i>And measure oxygen volume in the vat.</i>

08:13.092 --> 08:16.357
- <i>Find out how long the twins survived.</i>
- I'll get right on it.

08:16.429 --> 08:18.420
Mr. Kent, I'd like to start...

08:18.498 --> 08:21.592
by expressing theJustice Department's
sincere condolences...

08:21.667 --> 08:24.227
for the death of your sons,
Matthew and Ryan.

08:24.303 --> 08:26.430
If I'd ignored theJustice Department...

08:26.506 --> 08:28.474
and listened to Mr. Vega here...

08:28.541 --> 08:31.305
paid the two million...
my boys would still be alive today.

08:31.377 --> 08:36.405
- Sir, I understand your feelings towards the F.B.I.
- I doubt that.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.813
<i>[Vega]Jim, Agent Booth here</i>
<i>is investigating your sons' murder.</i>

08:38.885 --> 08:41.910
You know my problems with
the F.B.I.'s approach to kidnapping...

08:41.988 --> 08:44.821
but when it comes to finding killers...

08:44.891 --> 08:47.519
you want these people on your side.

08:51.097 --> 08:55.830
Ryan and Matty were spoiled.
[Chuckles]

08:55.902 --> 08:58.996
I know. They, uh, partied.

08:59.071 --> 09:01.767
- <i>They chased girls. They,</i> uh...
- <i>[Cell Phone Chimes]</i>

09:01.841 --> 09:03.832
<i>They got expelled from school.</i>

09:05.478 --> 09:08.311
<i>But they weren't bad kids.</i>

09:08.381 --> 09:13.341
<i>And there's no way that</i>
<i>they deserved suffocation.</i>

09:14.420 --> 09:17.287
<i>Is it painful?</i>

09:17.356 --> 09:19.688
Like falling asleep.

09:21.894 --> 09:25.796
Mr. Kent, the Grave Digger
lied to you and the F.B.I.

09:25.865 --> 09:29.096
<i>That's unlikely.</i>
<i>He doesn't play games.</i>

09:29.168 --> 09:32.968
Mr. Kent, is there any way you could've put
together the ransom in 12 hours?

09:33.039 --> 09:34.939
No way in the world.

09:35.007 --> 09:37.942
Which is exactly why the Grave Digger
provided Mr. Kent with 24 hours.

09:38.010 --> 09:41.537
His sons only had enough air for 12 hours.

09:41.614 --> 09:44.515
- Oh, my God.
- Even if you had ignored the F.B. I...

09:44.584 --> 09:48.145
and listened to Mr. Vega, you still wouldn't
have been able to save your sons.

09:48.220 --> 09:49.847
You're backstopping for the Bureau.

09:49.922 --> 09:54.552
<i>There were two of them in that vat.</i>
<i>They used up their oxygen twice as fast.</i>

09:54.627 --> 09:58.222
- The Grave Digger miscalculated.
- No, he doesn't do that.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.891
Then it was never his intention
that these boys survive.

10:00.967 --> 10:03.128
He just didn't care, Mr. Kent.

10:03.202 --> 10:07.866
So my decision to listen to the F.B.I.,
to not pay the ransom...

10:07.940 --> 10:12.172
If you had paid the ransom, your sons would
still have been dead by the time you got to them.

10:12.244 --> 10:14.235
There was nothing you could
have done, Mr. Kent.

10:14.313 --> 10:17.749
You are in no way responsible
for the death of your sons.

10:25.157 --> 10:27.091
[Tires Screeching]

10:27.159 --> 10:30.253
Had it occurred to you that God
is a lot like the Grave Digger?

10:30.329 --> 10:33.423
What?
What? What?

10:33.499 --> 10:37.094
He lays down the rules,
no way to question him or negotiate.

10:37.169 --> 10:39.933
Then it's almost as though
he doesn't care how it works out.

10:40.006 --> 10:43.567
Either you do as he says...
make some sacrifices, and they're delivered...

10:43.643 --> 10:46.441
or you don't,
and you end up in hell.

10:46.512 --> 10:48.946
You know what? I'd appreciate
if you didn't say things like that...

10:49.015 --> 10:51.040
because I really don't want
to get struck by lightning.

10:51.117 --> 10:52.709
Do you go to church every Sunday?

10:52.785 --> 10:54.446
- Yes, I do.
- Can I come with you?

10:54.520 --> 10:56.511
- No, you can't.
- Why? It might help me to understand.

10:56.589 --> 10:59.422
I am not gonna help you disrespect God
in his own house, okay?

10:59.492 --> 11:03.428
If you wanna do some kind of,
you know, anthropological study,
turn on the religious channel.

11:05.965 --> 11:08.433
Each of these contained one
of the Grave Digger's victims.

11:08.501 --> 11:10.401
Cozy.

11:10.469 --> 11:13.029
We also provided your people
with the clothes each victim was wearing.

11:13.105 --> 11:17.565
<i>Regarding the clothing, every one of them</i>
<i>shows traces of aluminum and sooty residue.</i>

11:17.643 --> 11:20.271
We know each victim was taken
from an underground garage...

11:20.346 --> 11:22.712
beyond the reach of security cameras.

11:22.782 --> 11:26.411
The typical kidnap-for-ransom profile
is middle-aged, in a job that's beneath him.

11:26.485 --> 11:30.683
<i>Smart guy who's an underachiever and someone</i>
<i>who enjoys control over somebody else's life.</i>

11:30.756 --> 11:33.384
- There's just one problem.
- What's that?

11:33.459 --> 11:36.155
See, there's nothing typical
about this guy.

11:36.228 --> 11:38.992
Don't expect him to fit the profile.

11:39.065 --> 11:40.999
Okay, the dimensions of the vat...

11:41.067 --> 11:43.661
six feet wide by eight feet tall...

11:43.736 --> 11:47.638
make it impossible for Matthew Kent
to have fractured his brother's pelvis.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.938
Even if Matthew knocked Ryan down
and, you know, stomped on him?

11:51.010 --> 11:53.911
Cam and I agree the fracture
was the result of one hard blow.

11:53.979 --> 11:56.106
<i>[Console Beeps]</i>

11:56.182 --> 11:59.674
A break like that would require a lot more
force than Matthew could have generated.

11:59.752 --> 12:03.347
<i>All right. So you're saying that Ryan</i>
<i>was injured before he went into that vat.</i>

12:03.422 --> 12:09.019
Yes. But the amount of blood on the floor
can't be explained by his injuries alone.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.689
- What?
- It was a mistake.

12:11.764 --> 12:16.428
- What was?
- Look, he intended to take one boy,
but he ended up with two.

12:16.502 --> 12:19.630
Oh. That's why they died
12 hours ahead of schedule.

12:19.705 --> 12:23.106
If he intended to take two boys, he would've
put 'em in a container twice as big.

12:23.175 --> 12:24.836
All right?
The Grave Digger... he messed up.

12:24.910 --> 12:28.209
He snuck up on Matthew, knocked him
unconscious, whatever, and Ryan was there.

12:28.280 --> 12:30.214
He shows up, and he fought the guy.

12:30.282 --> 12:32.182
No, Booth. Not fight.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.651
The leg damage, the fractured pelvis.

12:34.720 --> 12:37.018
These injuries are classic
human-versus-car.

12:37.089 --> 12:40.354
Ryan interrupts the kidnapping
of his brother.

12:40.426 --> 12:43.691
- And the Grave Digger runs him down.
- It was a mistake.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.027
The Grave Digger is not God, Bones...

12:46.098 --> 12:48.123
because God does not make mistakes.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.134
Mmm, I don't know.

12:50.202 --> 12:53.000
Putting testicles on the outside
didn't seem like such a good idea.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.935
Commercial stun gun, 625,000 volts...

12:57.009 --> 13:00.877
- still not enough.
- Well, it sounds like a lot of volts.

13:00.946 --> 13:03.676
Actually, it's the amperage
that does the real damage.

13:03.749 --> 13:06.809
But still, I've checked every
commercial stun gun I can find...

13:06.886 --> 13:09.252
and none of them generate
the right amount of power...

13:09.321 --> 13:11.346
to make those distinctive marks
on the bone.

13:11.423 --> 13:13.823
Well, what about a cattle prod?

13:13.893 --> 13:16.726
<i>Stun guns generate a lot more</i>
<i>power than cattle prods.</i>

13:16.796 --> 13:19.890
You haven't figured out the stun gun?
Then I am this week's king of the lab...

13:19.965 --> 13:22.024
- because I found something huge.
- [Sighs]

13:22.101 --> 13:25.935
You compete to be king of the lab?

13:26.972 --> 13:29.372
No.
[Scoffs]

13:29.441 --> 13:32.569
Hey, Angela.
I didn't know that you were...

13:35.948 --> 13:40.351
This sucks. [Clears Throat] I'm gonna
go catch Brennan, then bolt for the night.

13:40.419 --> 13:42.944
She just left. Hey.

13:45.591 --> 13:48.458
Could you stop being
so weird, please?

13:48.527 --> 13:50.518
It's making me very uncomfortable.

13:55.434 --> 13:57.368
You should give him a chance.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.404
Excuse me?

13:59.471 --> 14:03.567
- I apologize. I didn't say anything.
- Mm-hmm.

14:03.642 --> 14:05.974
- <i>[Footsteps Approaching]</i>
- <i>[Car Alarm Chirps]</i>

14:08.347 --> 14:10.406
<i>[Footsteps Rapidly Approaching]</i>

14:10.482 --> 14:12.245
- <i>[Brennan Gasps]</i>
- <i>[Electricity Crackling]</i>

14:12.318 --> 14:15.287
<i>Dr. Brennan.</i>
<i>Dr. Brennan?</i>

14:15.354 --> 14:17.652
<i>[Tires Screeching]</i>

14:18.824 --> 14:20.758
<i>[Cash Register Rings]</i>

14:20.826 --> 14:23.624
- What do you say we go
to New York for the weekend?
- Yeah.

14:23.696 --> 14:27.393
- I don't know.
- Come on. We're two adults with no obligations.

14:27.466 --> 14:30.867
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>
- Let it go to voice mail.

14:30.936 --> 14:34.235
We're not cheating.
We're not hurting anybody, Seeley.

14:34.306 --> 14:37.469
Then why are we keeping our relationship
such a secret, Camille?

14:37.543 --> 14:42.003
Because we work together,
and we're professionals,
and it's nobody's business. That's all.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.914
- So come to New York. We'll go to a musical.
- <i># [Cell Phone]</i>

14:44.984 --> 14:47.009
[Chuckles]

14:47.086 --> 14:49.987
Talking and singing and talking and dancing
and more singing?

14:50.055 --> 14:52.148
- [Beeps]
- You know? [Chuckles]

14:52.224 --> 14:54.454
If you wanna stop what we're doing,
just say so.

14:54.526 --> 14:57.586
You can fantasize about pulling out your gun
and shooting everyone on stage.

14:57.663 --> 14:59.597
And you know you like that.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.633
No, seriously.
We'll do something that you like...

15:01.700 --> 15:04.965
like climbing the outside
of the Empire State Building...

15:05.037 --> 15:07.369
or swimming the East River or...

15:07.439 --> 15:10.499
<i>What? What happened?</i>

15:13.412 --> 15:16.347
[Distorted Voice] Temperance Brennan
and Jack Hodgins have been buried alive.

15:16.415 --> 15:18.542
<i>Wire transfer eight million dollars...</i>

15:18.617 --> 15:21.211
to the following Grand Cayman account...

15:21.287 --> 15:23.517
or they will suffocate to death.

15:26.959 --> 15:28.893
[Distorted Voice]
Upon receiving the wire transfer...

15:28.961 --> 15:31.725
I will provide you with Brennan
and Hodgins's G.P.S. coordinates.

15:31.797 --> 15:34.129
This will be my last communication.

15:34.199 --> 15:36.793
It will be his last communication too.
He's never varied.

15:36.869 --> 15:39.963
He learned from the Kent boys.
He got two of them. He cut the deadline in half.

15:40.039 --> 15:43.372
Why is the Grave Digger demanding
so much money? It doesn't make any sense.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.967
He's always been reasonable at knowing
how much money people could raise...

15:46.045 --> 15:50.482
- within the time limit.
- Has, uh, Dr. Brennan made
that much money from her books?

15:50.549 --> 15:54.007
It's Hodgins. He's the sole heir to this thing
called the Cantilever Group.

15:54.086 --> 15:55.280
And what's that?

15:56.088 --> 15:58.318
Just the third largest privately owned
corporation in the country.

15:58.390 --> 16:01.518
Make sense now, Tom?

16:07.299 --> 16:11.429
[Grunts] I was on my way to karate class,
so we have lots of bottled water.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.471
What happened?
Where are we?

16:13.539 --> 16:16.667
<i>The last thing I remember</i>
<i>is being at the lab.</i>

16:16.742 --> 16:19.267
- I'm really confused.
- <i>Yeah.</i>

16:19.345 --> 16:21.279
What happened to my legs?

16:22.448 --> 16:27.112
- Where are we?
- Underground. Buried.

16:28.253 --> 16:31.086
I have a burn.

16:33.092 --> 16:35.856
Zack was trying to figure out
what kind of stun gun.

16:35.928 --> 16:38.192
It has to be the Grave Digger.

16:38.263 --> 16:41.721
<i>I think he ran you down</i>
<i>with his car and then...</i>

16:41.800 --> 16:44.564
pumped you full of drugs
to ruin your short-term memory.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.934
- Same as Ryan Kent.
- How long have we been down here?

16:47.006 --> 16:50.806
Um, maybe two hours, I think.

16:50.876 --> 16:52.810
Okay.

16:52.878 --> 16:56.575
So this vehicle has, I'd say,
60... 60 cubic feet of air.

16:56.648 --> 17:01.108
Uh, it's 20 percent just oxygen.
Two people.

17:01.186 --> 17:03.120
My brain is not working.

17:03.188 --> 17:06.021
The Grave Digger is very consistent.

17:06.090 --> 17:09.219
If we started with 12 hours of air...

17:09.294 --> 17:11.387
we'll be unconscious in 10.

17:11.463 --> 17:13.988
<i>After that,</i> if...

17:14.066 --> 17:17.194
if no one pays the ransom...

17:18.203 --> 17:20.728
We're dead.

17:23.776 --> 17:26.040
<i>How are we gonna get our hands</i>
<i>on eight million dollars?</i>

17:26.111 --> 17:28.045
- Hodgins is rich.
- He is?

17:28.113 --> 17:30.946
Rich squared to the power of 10
times four is how he describes it.

17:31.016 --> 17:32.950
You're gonna
pay the ransom, right?

17:33.018 --> 17:36.249
Yes. F.B.I. standard ops... they won't work.
Grave Digger operates outside statistics.

17:36.321 --> 17:39.017
- They'll fire you.
- Oh, that's cool. One less reason to wear a suit.

17:39.091 --> 17:42.788
- <i>How did the Grave Digger catch</i>
<i>Brennan and Hodgins together?</i>
- Bones was on her way to karate.

17:42.861 --> 17:45.295
And Hodgins said that
he'd found something huge.

17:45.364 --> 17:47.355
He tried to catch Dr. Brennan.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.802
Here!

18:00.879 --> 18:02.870
Oh, my God.

18:02.948 --> 18:04.973
Oh, that's blood, isn't it?

18:05.050 --> 18:08.884
- It'll turn out to be Hodgins's.
- Dr. Brennan doesn't like it
when we jump to conclusions.

18:08.954 --> 18:10.444
She'll appreciate we're on a deadline.

18:10.522 --> 18:12.888
Look, Hodgins interrupted the kidnapping
just like Ryan and Matthew.

18:12.958 --> 18:16.359
- <i>[Booth] The Grave Digger must've run him over.</i>
- God, what are we gonna do?

18:16.428 --> 18:18.362
It's a crime scene.
They'll look for tire tracks.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.864
They'll check the security cameras.
I need you to be Dr. Brennan.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.367
- I don't know what that means.
- It means keep working the case.

18:23.435 --> 18:28.065
- <i>I need to know why Hodgins</i>
<i>was chasing after Bones.</i>
- I'll look at his notes.

18:28.140 --> 18:30.768
- Well, what about me?
- Call Bones's brother Russ.
Tell him what's going on.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.141
I'm gonna go talk to the chairman
of the Cantilever Group.

18:33.212 --> 18:35.203
[Dialing]

18:38.217 --> 18:40.515
We have water, towels...

18:40.586 --> 18:43.714
a mini-kit, ibuprofen...

18:43.789 --> 18:45.723
two cell phones
with no batteries...

18:45.791 --> 18:47.759
a digital camera
with a backup battery...

18:47.826 --> 18:50.852
and a handful of pens.

18:50.929 --> 18:53.159
That one's a laser pointer.

18:53.232 --> 18:55.666
And a copy of my novel.

18:55.734 --> 18:58.862
Hey, we can read it
to each other if we get bored.

18:58.937 --> 19:03.533
- Deep Rhapsody.
- <i>Careful.</i>

19:03.609 --> 19:06.510
That's three grand a quarter ounce.
[Winces]

19:06.578 --> 19:11.447
Yeah, I'd make that face too
if I spent $3,000 on perfume.

19:11.517 --> 19:14.008
Oh, man. Something...

19:14.086 --> 19:17.852
- My leg.
- Okay, here. Here.

19:20.025 --> 19:22.789
I'm worried you have
compartment syndrome.

19:22.861 --> 19:25.921
[Grunts]
Is that terminal?

19:25.998 --> 19:27.932
I mean, within the next few hours?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.595
- No.
- But?

19:31.670 --> 19:34.230
It's gonna get painful.

19:34.306 --> 19:37.798
- More painful than now?
- Yeah.

19:37.876 --> 19:39.810
Slip-into-shock-and-die painful.

19:39.878 --> 19:41.869
Wow.

19:42.881 --> 19:45.315
There's nothing we can do about that?

19:45.384 --> 19:48.046
Actually, there is.

19:48.120 --> 19:51.487
Oh, I'm not gonna like this, am I?

19:55.827 --> 19:57.761
What are you doing?

19:57.829 --> 20:01.595
The Grave Digger modified
a commercial stun gun to knock out his victims.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.601
I've figured out
the voltage and amperage...

20:03.669 --> 20:06.069
but not how he modified it
to boost the current.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.743
Which will not help us find
Dr. Brennan and Hodgins.

20:14.813 --> 20:18.112
- I did figure out how Ryan Kent died.
- Let's hear it.

20:18.183 --> 20:21.812
He killed himself. Punctured his carotid artery,
which explains the amount of blood we found.

20:21.887 --> 20:25.345
He used a pen. There's a nick
on the inferior angle of the mandible.

20:25.424 --> 20:28.860
I don't know why he did it.
I don't really do "why." I just do "how."

20:28.927 --> 20:33.421
He did it to give his brother more air.
So his twin would survive.

20:33.498 --> 20:36.797
- That's why we found them holding each other.
- How does that help?

20:36.868 --> 20:39.769
When we tell Mr. Kent that one
of his sons gave his own life...

20:39.838 --> 20:42.432
in an effort to save his brother,
it'll mean something, Zack.

20:44.209 --> 20:47.144
Just keep searching, okay?

21:00.525 --> 21:03.392
Okay, I'm ready.

21:03.462 --> 21:05.726
Is that a note to Angela?

21:05.797 --> 21:09.028
Yes. Just in case.

21:09.101 --> 21:12.468
<i>If whatever you're gonna</i>
<i>do to me sends me into shock...</i>

21:12.537 --> 21:14.528
I might die.

21:14.606 --> 21:19.634
Upside? Me not breathing
doubles your survival time.

21:19.711 --> 21:22.407
I'm not interested
in surviving that way.

21:23.782 --> 21:27.047
What I'm going to do is make
a long incision in the fascia...

21:27.119 --> 21:29.986
to release the pressure inside.

21:30.055 --> 21:32.990
And how... how long is a "long incision"?

21:33.058 --> 21:35.424
Wait. You know what?
Don't tell me.

21:35.494 --> 21:38.520
It's best if I do it very fast
and without empathy.

21:40.666 --> 21:42.861
Here.

21:42.934 --> 21:45.425
Hang on to something.

21:45.504 --> 21:47.665
And don't fight passing out.

21:50.275 --> 21:52.743
You ready?

21:58.583 --> 22:01.051
Wait.

22:04.723 --> 22:06.714
<i>What is that?</i>

22:06.792 --> 22:09.022
Evidence of what happened to you.

22:09.094 --> 22:11.187
Let's... Let's worry about it later.

22:11.263 --> 22:15.791
Here. Just put it
in the pages of your book.

22:15.867 --> 22:18.529
<i>I'll take a look at it later.</i>

22:21.973 --> 22:23.907
[Mumbling]

22:25.610 --> 22:27.544
It's best if you don't talk right now.

22:29.214 --> 22:31.307
I am nuts about Angela.

22:31.383 --> 22:34.045
<i>Over the moon.</i>

22:34.119 --> 22:36.553
Stupid in love with her.

22:39.224 --> 22:43.058
That's why I bought her that...
that crazy expensive perfume.

22:45.430 --> 22:48.627
A man gives you a bottle
of perfume like that, it says...

22:49.968 --> 22:51.902
It says, "I love you."

22:53.905 --> 22:57.841
There.
I said it out loud.

23:11.723 --> 23:13.657
[Muffled Screaming]

23:24.202 --> 23:26.136
Did you find Russ?

23:26.204 --> 23:28.764
He's on a fishing trip with friends
in the White Mountains.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.774
No phone, no cell service.

23:30.842 --> 23:34.869
- You?
- Hodgins seems to write everything
in some kind of code.

23:34.946 --> 23:38.643
I might have to get Zack
over here to break it.

23:38.717 --> 23:41.743
It says that the traces of aluminum
found on the clothing...

23:41.820 --> 23:45.119
were almost certainly
from the kidnapper's vehicle...

23:45.190 --> 23:49.627
like a box in the back
of a trunk or a van.

23:49.694 --> 23:51.685
You can read that?

23:52.764 --> 23:55.358
Yeah. Hodgins sends me a lot of notes.

23:56.935 --> 24:01.133
Why bother with all of this?

24:01.206 --> 24:03.800
We don't need evidence.
We need millions of dollars.

24:11.283 --> 24:13.945
I can't get the ransom together,
not in time.

24:14.019 --> 24:16.010
The Cantilever Group
has got this policy.

24:16.087 --> 24:20.148
No proof of life from the kidnapper,
no ransom.

24:20.225 --> 24:23.194
- Not even for the boss?
- It's his rule. It's no exceptions.

24:23.261 --> 24:28.324
They say they need more time.
Except the Grave Digger
doesn't give us that or proof of life.

24:28.400 --> 24:31.426
Booth, I don't think it's a coincidence
that he took Brennan when he did.

24:31.503 --> 24:34.404
Yeah. I was kinda thinking the same thing.

24:37.409 --> 24:39.274
- <i>[Horn Honks]</i>
- [Gasps]

24:39.344 --> 24:43.110
Oh, thank God I didn't kill you.

24:43.181 --> 24:45.172
- How long was I unconscious?
- <i>For a while.</i>

24:45.250 --> 24:47.912
- How's your leg?
- Better.

24:47.986 --> 24:50.887
Lots better.
What are you doing?

24:50.956 --> 24:54.084
Hot-wiring the phone to the
horn so we can send a message.

24:54.159 --> 24:57.390
- From underground?
- We get radio reception.

24:57.462 --> 24:59.896
Direct current 12-volt
will burn out the circuits...

24:59.965 --> 25:02.195
in a 4.2- volt cell phone
in a microsecond.

25:02.267 --> 25:04.792
- <i>Betterjury-rig a resistor.</i>
- Smart.

25:04.870 --> 25:07.532
Might work long enough to send
a single burst transmission.

25:07.606 --> 25:11.565
A very short text message.
Booth can trace it to a cell phone relay tower.

25:11.643 --> 25:14.908
And what message shall we send?
"Good-bye"?

25:14.980 --> 25:17.278
- <i>"Nice to know you"?</i>
- What are we surrounded by?

25:17.349 --> 25:19.408
Pain...

25:19.484 --> 25:21.543
despair...

25:21.620 --> 25:24.646
and a subsoil accumulation
of agglutinate aridisols.

25:24.723 --> 25:27.988
- Dirt.
- I don't like the term "dirt."

25:28.059 --> 25:30.323
All right. Then...

25:34.733 --> 25:36.667
tell me something I don't know.

25:41.806 --> 25:45.105
Ash.
[Sniffs]

25:46.711 --> 25:50.841
Hints of nitrogen and sulfur.
[Spits]

25:50.916 --> 25:54.408
- So where are we?
- We're in coal country.

25:54.486 --> 25:56.545
Bituminous coal country.

25:56.621 --> 25:59.488
Basically, Virginia.

25:59.558 --> 26:01.958
We need more than that.

26:02.027 --> 26:04.052
The laser.

26:04.129 --> 26:06.723
And we need benzophenone.

26:06.798 --> 26:10.825
Benzophenone... it's in soaps
and plastic packaging...

26:10.902 --> 26:13.029
sunscreen.

26:13.104 --> 26:15.800
We don't have any sunscreen.

26:15.874 --> 26:17.865
Angela's perfume.

26:17.943 --> 26:21.344
Three grand that cost.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.541
Hodgins, I will split the cost
when we get out of here.

26:24.616 --> 26:27.779
There's something
you don't know about me.

26:29.287 --> 26:31.278
I'm rich.

26:31.356 --> 26:33.347
Me too.

26:33.425 --> 26:38.226
No. No, you're... well-off.

26:38.296 --> 26:41.493
My family owns the Cantilever Group.

26:41.566 --> 26:44.626
And there's not many of us left alive.

26:44.703 --> 26:46.898
One, to be exact.

26:46.972 --> 26:50.806
- Me.
- Okay, I won't split it with you.

26:57.983 --> 27:00.850
It smells nice.

27:02.854 --> 27:04.822
I need the camera.

27:07.325 --> 27:09.793
Okay.

27:09.861 --> 27:11.852
Okay.

27:17.335 --> 27:19.326
[Camera Whirring]

27:23.742 --> 27:25.676
I know where we are.

27:29.614 --> 27:32.947
There's no negotiating
with the Grave Digger.

27:33.018 --> 27:36.784
[Exhales] You've been through this,
what, uh, five times with this guy?

27:36.855 --> 27:40.416
Exactly. So I know him.
And he does not negotiate.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.460
Aw, what?
What, no chat room action with him?

27:42.527 --> 27:45.087
Are you nuts?
I hate the son of a bitch.

27:45.163 --> 27:47.757
Why? He's made you rich.

27:47.832 --> 27:50.460
You know what?
You just need to deal with the facts.

27:50.535 --> 27:55.404
That if you can't put the ransom together
in the time he gave you, your partner is dead.

27:57.976 --> 28:00.604
Here's the deal, all right?
You have a relationship with this guy.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.944
What they call symbiotic.
You benefit from each other. Hmm?

28:04.015 --> 28:06.609
So know this, huh?

28:06.685 --> 28:10.883
That deadline comes around and my partner
is still underground, I will end you.

28:10.955 --> 28:12.889
You understand?

28:12.957 --> 28:15.221
- [Gasping]
- Yeah?

28:16.294 --> 28:18.956

is anodized plastic filament...

28:36.481 --> 28:40.110
encoded metallic tape
with dried-out adhesive.

28:41.586 --> 28:43.781
I think it's a bumper sticker.

28:43.855 --> 28:46.346
You mean like,
"If you can read this, you're too close"?

28:46.424 --> 28:49.257
No. Like a prepaid toll road pass.

28:51.296 --> 28:53.355
Someone ran me down with a car.

28:53.431 --> 28:55.422
We knew that already.

28:55.500 --> 28:58.526
Yeah, but now we've proved it,
and I find I'm really annoyed.

28:58.603 --> 29:01.834
Four to six seconds to enter a message
and hit speed dial.

29:01.906 --> 29:06.138
- I figured out a text message
using eight key strikes.
- How's your text messaging?

29:06.211 --> 29:09.772
Thumbs like lightning.
I can do it.

29:09.848 --> 29:11.975
Okay.

- Yeah.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.888

29:50.955 --> 29:52.889
Hypoxia leads to mental confusion.

29:52.957 --> 29:55.482
- It's Bones. This means something.
- Did you try dialing the number?

29:55.560 --> 29:57.653

normal stuff, okay?

29:57.729 --> 30:00.391
That's why I'm here talking

30:03.168 --> 30:05.762
- Booth, they're not cops.
- Yeah. We're running out of time.

30:05.837 --> 30:10.433
Minor correction. Dr. Brennan and Hodgins
will run out of air in four seconds.

30:12.911 --> 30:14.845

30:35.433 --> 30:37.958

30:38.036 --> 30:42.837
A little. Four other tires,
but we can't get to 'em.

30:42.907 --> 30:44.898
Is there anything else?

30:44.976 --> 30:47.240
If the ransom was paid,
we'd be out by now.

30:47.312 --> 30:50.748
- Why prolong the inevitable?
- Booth will find us.

30:50.815 --> 30:53.807
You have a lot of faith in Booth.

30:53.885 --> 30:55.819
No.

30:55.887 --> 30:58.981
Faith is an irrational belief in something
that is logically impossible.

30:59.057 --> 31:02.493
Over time, I've seen what Booth can do.
It's not faith.

31:02.560 --> 31:04.551
No offense.

31:04.629 --> 31:07.496
And I'm not just saying this
because you filleted me with a knife.

31:08.900 --> 31:10.993
We are out of air.

31:11.069 --> 31:15.096
We don't know if our message got out,
much less if anyone understood it.

31:15.173 --> 31:18.506
And we are buried underground.

31:19.944 --> 31:21.935
What you have is faith, baby.

31:22.013 --> 31:23.742
- [Chuckles]
- Sorry.

31:23.815 --> 31:26.443
The "baby" thing is a reflex.

31:26.517 --> 31:30.351
You shouldn't talk right now,
to conserve air.

31:34.259 --> 31:37.251
I need the camera batteries
and the preservative powder from your kit.

31:37.328 --> 31:39.523
Soda ash and lithium?

31:41.099 --> 31:44.193
You're going to make
a carbon dioxide scrubber?

31:44.269 --> 31:47.705
If you can perform surgery
out of thin air...

31:47.772 --> 31:51.435
then I can pull a little
thin air out of thin air.

31:51.509 --> 31:53.340
[Chuckling]

31:53.411 --> 31:57.040
Okay. Zack figured out what stun gun
the Grave Digger uses and how it's modified.

31:57.115 --> 31:59.049
Thanks to Angela, we know
that the Grave Digger...

31:59.117 --> 32:01.449
has a customized aluminum case
in the back of his vehicle.

32:01.519 --> 32:03.453
I got about a hundred agents
working that angle.

32:03.521 --> 32:05.682
What does this mean?
Right here. What does that mean?

32:05.757 --> 32:08.817
You're forgetting something!
Brennan and Hodgins are out of air.

32:08.893 --> 32:12.192
Great. You wanna give up, huh? This is Bones
we're talking about, and Hodgins.

32:12.263 --> 32:14.322
<i>You think they didn't find a way</i>
<i>to extend their air?</i>

32:14.399 --> 32:19.200
<i>They found a way to send us a message, ask</i>
<i>for help. And you want to give up because of math?</i>

32:21.105 --> 32:25.701
Soda ash. Lithium reacts with high
concentrations of carbon dioxide...

32:25.777 --> 32:28.007
produces oxygen.

32:28.079 --> 32:30.070
- Oh.
- [Laughing]

32:34.585 --> 32:37.554
That gives us just long enough.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.613
Just long enough for what?

32:39.691 --> 32:42.216
My next idea, which will kill us.

32:42.293 --> 32:44.227
Air bags.

32:44.295 --> 32:46.229
They aren't actually bags of air.

32:46.297 --> 32:49.323
I'm not looking to extend
our survival underground.

32:49.400 --> 32:51.391
I'm looking to blow our way
out of here.

32:51.469 --> 32:54.165
Using the explosives
from the air bags?

32:55.506 --> 32:57.770
That could definitely kill us.

32:57.842 --> 33:00.709
So will doing nothing.

- Great. Then what is it?

33:34.946 --> 33:37.779
Can I make a suggestion?
See, this is exactly why I was sent here.

33:37.849 --> 33:40.545
You guys are brilliant, but
you won't make intuitive leaps.

33:40.618 --> 33:43.212
- You mean jump to conclusions?
- That's exactly what I mean.

33:43.287 --> 33:46.484
This is a message from one of them
to one of us... specific, focused.

33:46.557 --> 33:48.957
- Who was it meant to get to?
- Easy. Brennan's cell to mine.

33:49.027 --> 33:51.723
Right? The message was for me.
We have an understanding. We work together.

33:51.796 --> 33:54.560
We all work together.
She's my best friend.

33:54.632 --> 33:56.759
And Hodgins...

33:57.902 --> 34:00.496
- Hodgins...
- She's right.

34:00.571 --> 34:02.937
- We should assume the message
is from Hodgins, not Brennan.
- Why?

34:03.007 --> 34:06.101
- Because they're buried alive.
- <i>[Angela] And Hodgins is all about dirt.</i>

34:06.177 --> 34:08.804
Okay, great.
The message is about dirt. But who is it to?

34:08.880 --> 34:12.679
Angela. Hodgins is all about
dirt and Angela.

34:12.750 --> 34:15.617
But it's numbers, Zack.
It's for you.

34:15.686 --> 34:18.280
Hodgins would've written me
a line of poetry or something.

34:18.356 --> 34:22.190
Agent Booth. Janine used all her contacts
and got me on all the local news shows.

34:22.260 --> 34:25.092
And I explained that we needed more time.
I asked him to call.

34:25.163 --> 34:27.255
I'm sorry,
but he's completely consistent.

34:27.331 --> 34:29.458
Six, seven, 16.

34:29.534 --> 34:33.094
Carbon, nitrogen and sulfur
on the periodic table of elements.

34:33.170 --> 34:35.935
They are buried in coal-rich soil.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.440
- [Beeping]
- You gotta narrow it down, Zack.

34:38.509 --> 34:42.467
- Keep going, Zack.
- The mineral components in coal are all the same.

34:42.547 --> 34:47.382
It's the organic components that provide
a unique fingerprint. They're called macerals.

34:47.452 --> 34:49.283
They fluoresce at different levels.

34:49.353 --> 34:52.049
<i>A reflectance of 1.4 is quite rare...</i>

34:52.123 --> 34:56.286
suggesting a high concentration of inertinite.

34:56.360 --> 34:59.454
- Zack, tell me what that means.
- It means he knows where they are.

34:59.530 --> 35:02.658
- Zack?
- [Beeping]

35:02.733 --> 35:05.668
I know where they are.

35:09.240 --> 35:13.643
- <i>Can this possibly work?</i>
- I'm not really an explosives expert...

35:13.711 --> 35:17.306
but the dash might shape the charge
enough to blow out the windshield.

35:17.381 --> 35:21.010
If we're less than four feet
beneath the surface...

35:21.085 --> 35:23.076
this charge could blow us to freedom.

35:23.154 --> 35:25.418
If we're buried more than four feet deep?

35:26.657 --> 35:30.354
Then the concussion
will turn our brains into jelly.

35:30.428 --> 35:34.387
Well, then we can run for Congress,
so it's a win-win.

35:34.465 --> 35:37.161
[Chuckles]

35:37.235 --> 35:39.533

I can't sleep, Angela.

40:10.775 --> 40:13.676
I thought that they gave you
something for that.

40:13.744 --> 40:16.144
No. I mean...

40:16.213 --> 40:18.875
I'm afraid...

40:18.949 --> 40:21.850
that if I close my eyes, when I...

40:21.919 --> 40:25.616
when I open them, I'm gonna
be back in that car...

40:25.689 --> 40:28.783
and buried, running out of air.

40:32.263 --> 40:37.394
Okay. Then you should
come home with me.

40:37.468 --> 40:39.333
What?

40:39.403 --> 40:44.238
When you open your eyes, I'll be there.

40:44.308 --> 40:46.242
Yeah?

40:46.310 --> 40:49.143
Yeah.

40:49.213 --> 40:51.204
Okay.

40:55.920 --> 40:58.650
You know I'm good
for that crutch money.

40:58.722 --> 41:00.917
[Both Chuckling]

41:05.963 --> 41:07.988
[Sniffles]

41:10.234 --> 41:12.759
<i># [Soft Rock]</i>

41:15.940 --> 41:19.171
<i># [Continues]</i>

41:19.243 --> 41:21.404
What'd you ask for?

41:21.479 --> 41:25.040
That's between me and a certain saint.

41:25.115 --> 41:29.609
- Although I did ask for a little help
finding the Grave Digger.
- Good move.

41:31.822 --> 41:34.086
What's that smell?

41:34.158 --> 41:36.820
The candles.

41:36.894 --> 41:38.919
And I said thanks.

41:38.996 --> 41:41.931
- You should try it sometime.
- If I were going to pray...

41:41.999 --> 41:44.559
I would have done it just before
we set off the explosion.

41:44.635 --> 41:47.297
- And you didn't?
- No.

41:47.371 --> 41:49.532
See, if there was a God,
which there isn't...

41:49.607 --> 41:54.977
Shh.
Do you see where we are?

41:55.045 --> 41:59.277
- And if I were someone
who believed he had a plan...
- Which I do.

41:59.350 --> 42:04.083
then I'd be tempted to think he wanted me
to go through something like I went through...

42:04.154 --> 42:09.490
because it might make me more
open to the whole... concept.

42:09.560 --> 42:12.552
Hmm. And it obviously hasn't.

42:12.630 --> 42:16.327
I'm okay with you thanking God
for saving me and Hodgins.

42:17.401 --> 42:20.666
That's not what I thanked him for.

42:20.738 --> 42:25.641
I thanked him for saving all of us.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.644
<i>It was all of us.</i>

42:28.712 --> 42:32.273
Every single one.

42:32.349 --> 42:34.977
You take one of us away...

42:35.052 --> 42:37.953
and you and Hodgins
are in that hole forever.

42:40.925 --> 42:44.088
And I'm thankful for that.

42:45.162 --> 42:48.131
I knew you wouldn't give up.

42:51.702 --> 42:54.136
I knew you wouldn't give up.

42:59.243 --> 43:04.340
<i># [Ends]</i>

43:40.117 --> 43:41.516
What's that mean?
