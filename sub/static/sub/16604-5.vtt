WEBVTT

00:02.309 --> 00:04.078
Look, I have Frank and
Monica as parents,

00:04.080 --> 00:06.150
even I know how to show up
and turn on a fuckin' TV.

00:06.151 --> 00:07.754
What the fuck happened to you?

00:07.755 --> 00:10.091
First of the month. Pony up.

00:10.092 --> 00:12.295
Fiona's gonna kick me out
unless I can pull my weight.

00:12.296 --> 00:13.666
Find husband.

00:13.667 --> 00:15.402
- Where's Derek?
- You scared him.

00:15.403 --> 00:16.938
He doesn't want to have a baby.

00:16.939 --> 00:18.174
I've had a hell of a day.

00:18.175 --> 00:19.678
We haven't really spoken in weeks.

00:19.679 --> 00:21.948
You're busy. No time for me and my shit.

00:21.949 --> 00:23.418
Military school changed my life.

00:23.419 --> 00:25.021
Fiona, I want to go to military school.

00:25.022 --> 00:26.424
You serious?

00:26.425 --> 00:27.760
<i>Svetlana's been going over</i>

00:27.761 --> 00:29.263
our bills and income from the bar.

00:29.264 --> 00:32.034
Our yield on gross revenues are shit.

00:32.036 --> 00:33.872
<i>You know that the
woman who owns this place</i>

00:33.873 --> 00:35.542
<i>dropped out of high school,</i>

00:35.543 --> 00:37.345
<i>and now she owns, like,
half the South Side?</i>

00:38.850 --> 00:40.018
I'm packing, dummy.

00:40.019 --> 00:41.187
Fuck, you brought a gun in here?

00:41.188 --> 00:43.291
No, I am trans man.

00:43.292 --> 00:44.728
So you don't have a dick?

00:44.729 --> 00:47.532
Tinder rocks... Free
sex anytime I want it,

00:47.533 --> 00:48.635
no strings attached.

00:48.636 --> 00:49.904
Welcome, new Gallaghers.

00:49.905 --> 00:52.075
<i>Home sweet homeless shelter.</i>

00:52.076 --> 00:55.081
All in favor of preserving the shelter?

00:55.082 --> 00:58.756
<i>One local hero has decided
to take a stand.</i>

00:58.757 --> 01:00.358
- Uh, who are you?
- Dylan Oswald.

01:00.359 --> 01:01.527
Your new boss.

01:01.528 --> 01:02.864
You knew that you were hooking me up

01:02.865 --> 01:04.465
<i>with a shady business?</i>

01:04.467 --> 01:05.970
<i>Is it a crime to rip people off</i>

01:05.971 --> 01:07.006
<i>who are ripping other people off?</i>

01:14.780 --> 01:18.085
<i>* Think of all the luck you got *</i>

01:18.086 --> 01:21.191
<i>* Know that it's not for naught *</i>

01:21.192 --> 01:24.297
<i>* You were beaming once before *</i>

01:24.298 --> 01:28.840
<i>* But it's not like that anymore *</i>

01:28.841 --> 01:32.046
<i>* What is this downside *</i>

01:32.047 --> 01:35.454
<i>* That you speak of? *</i>

01:35.455 --> 01:37.725
<i>* What is this feeling *</i>

01:37.726 --> 01:42.234
<i>* You're so sure of? *</i>

01:49.148 --> 01:52.320

02:24.162 --> 02:25.230
Hey.

02:28.070 --> 02:31.710
Hey.

02:31.711 --> 02:33.547
Shit, what time is it?

02:33.548 --> 02:35.985
It's still early.

02:35.986 --> 02:38.022
Oh.

02:38.023 --> 02:40.159
Um, sorry for crashing overnight.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.997
It's all good.

02:41.998 --> 02:44.268
I got to jump in the shower and
get ready for work, though.

02:44.269 --> 02:45.403
Oh, so should I wait?

02:45.404 --> 02:47.675
Or, you know, I could join you.

02:49.647 --> 02:51.883
Everybody's gonna be up soon.

02:51.884 --> 02:53.486
Better if you're not still here.

02:53.487 --> 02:55.324
Oh, yeah. Yeah, okay.

02:57.028 --> 02:59.699
I don't like a lot of
casual guys hanging around.

02:59.700 --> 03:02.003
It confuses Lucas.

03:02.004 --> 03:04.174
Yeah. No, I-I get that.

03:07.481 --> 03:09.585
I'll see you at the diner later?

03:09.586 --> 03:11.355
Yeah, after my intern gig.

03:11.356 --> 03:13.593
It's the first day back
after the Feds busted us,

03:13.594 --> 03:15.496
so I have no idea what I'm walking into.

03:15.497 --> 03:17.703
Sounds fun.

03:37.776 --> 03:41.048
- What the hell?
- Mm, sugar...

03:41.049 --> 03:44.889
either I'm still high,
or we got company.

03:44.890 --> 03:46.726
What're you doing there, amigo?

03:46.727 --> 03:49.398
- Checking the roof, <i>pendejo.</i>
- Oh, no.

03:49.399 --> 03:51.435
Wait.

03:51.436 --> 03:52.705
Wait.

03:52.706 --> 03:53.707
Oh, God.

03:57.181 --> 04:00.921
Are they throwing us out again?

04:16.319 --> 04:18.122
- Mr. Gallagher?
- No.

04:18.123 --> 04:19.324
Maybe.

04:19.325 --> 04:20.894
I'm Elena Torres

04:20.894 --> 04:23.399
from the Make A Nest
nonprofit on Troy Street.

04:23.400 --> 04:26.472
Your news coverage has
been making quite a stir

04:26.473 --> 04:27.975
in the social-services community.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.679
It has?

04:29.680 --> 04:32.918
We've got some good news
concerning your housing crisis.

04:32.919 --> 04:35.323
You... you, uh...

04:35.324 --> 04:37.093
Here. Uh, Jesus.

04:37.094 --> 04:38.496
Oh, come on, hey, hey.

04:38.497 --> 04:41.603
G-get a room, you two.

04:41.604 --> 04:43.305
Uh, sit, sit.

04:43.306 --> 04:46.813
I-I, uh... Yeah, I-I'll stand.

04:46.814 --> 04:48.382
- Yeah.
- Mr. Gallagher...

04:48.383 --> 04:50.587
perhaps you've heard of Simon Epstein,

04:50.588 --> 04:53.225
the real estate mogul?

04:53.226 --> 04:57.500
The billionaire who got
busted emailing dick pics?

04:57.501 --> 04:59.672
Mr. Epstein, um, is
actually a philanthropist

04:59.673 --> 05:01.275
for the homeless.

05:01.276 --> 05:02.978
After seeing you on the news,

05:02.979 --> 05:07.320
he immediately contacted our
community-service organization.

05:07.321 --> 05:10.827
- You're kicking us out?
- N-no, no, Mr. Gallagher.

05:10.828 --> 05:13.365
Simon Epstein purchased this house

05:13.366 --> 05:16.773
for the South Side homeless.

05:16.774 --> 05:19.010
A billionaire with a bleeding heart

05:19.011 --> 05:20.881
and a big dick bought this place for me?

05:20.882 --> 05:23.853
Uh, he, uh... He bought
it for all of you.

05:23.854 --> 05:26.993
And he's asked our organization
to manage the property.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.364
We're getting calls from
corporate interests

05:29.365 --> 05:31.501
who would like to become sponsors.

05:31.502 --> 05:34.374
Because of your commitment
to the homeless,

05:34.375 --> 05:38.148
this is now public housing.

05:38.149 --> 05:39.885
Mr. Epstein will drop by later today

05:39.886 --> 05:42.758
for a quick photo opportunity
with you and your family.

05:42.759 --> 05:44.060
I own this place.

05:44.061 --> 05:46.599
Uh, no. Uh...

05:46.600 --> 05:50.039
not just you, but, yes,
it is off the market,

05:50.040 --> 05:52.510
and we are thrilled to
be part of your cause,

05:52.511 --> 05:56.184
and we would love to
participate in any way we can.

05:59.358 --> 06:00.493
Yes.

06:00.494 --> 06:01.663
<i>* Do somethin' crazy *</i>

06:04.670 --> 06:05.837
<i>* Okay *</i>

06:08.569 --> 06:09.872
<i>* Good vibes only. *</i>

06:09.880 --> 06:11.715
<i>* I'll just have to cave *</i>

06:11.716 --> 06:13.519
<i>* I'ma fill my cup *</i>

06:13.520 --> 06:15.523
<i>* Got fireworks, got booze *</i>

06:15.524 --> 06:17.460
<i>* Let's blow some shit up *</i>

06:17.461 --> 06:19.464
<i>* Tonight I'm goin' stupid *</i>

06:19.465 --> 06:21.568
<i>* Doin' things I've never done *</i>

06:21.569 --> 06:23.773
<i>* We all got one thing in common *</i>

06:23.774 --> 06:25.309
<i>* We just want to have fun *</i>

06:25.310 --> 06:26.578
<i>* Hey! *</i>

06:26.579 --> 06:28.615
<i>So what you want to do?</i>

06:32.792 --> 06:33.993
<i>* Do somethin' crazy *</i>

06:38.236 --> 06:40.239
Whew.

06:40.240 --> 06:41.976
I may have broken a Tinder record

06:41.977 --> 06:43.980
for how many places to
hit it in one room.

06:43.981 --> 06:47.253
So, uh, take the El or call an Uber?

06:47.254 --> 06:50.392
Wow. Okay.

06:50.393 --> 06:52.764
Down to business, huh?

06:52.765 --> 06:54.969
No offense, it's just
I'm running a business,

06:54.970 --> 06:56.806
and I can't save chips
unless I'm working.

06:56.807 --> 06:58.041
Oh, I get it...

06:58.042 --> 07:01.281
Sex and back to thinking money.

07:01.282 --> 07:03.051
Just a little word of advice...

07:03.052 --> 07:04.888
If you're really a businesswoman,

07:04.889 --> 07:06.892
you'd stack chips, not save 'em.

07:06.893 --> 07:09.899
What are you,
my financial consultant?

07:12.471 --> 07:15.743
Marketplace Consulting International?

07:15.744 --> 07:19.317
You mean you're actually
a financial consultant?

07:19.318 --> 07:22.490
Let me know when you want to
book an investment consultation.

07:22.491 --> 07:25.330
I'm just a swipe away.

07:26.800 --> 07:28.536
Bye, Fiona.

07:48.476 --> 07:49.912
Shit.

07:49.913 --> 07:51.448
Uh-oh.

07:55.423 --> 07:57.626
- What was that noise?
- I think it was the sound

07:57.627 --> 07:59.464
of the washer dyin'.

07:59.465 --> 08:00.666
Fiona broke it.

08:00.667 --> 08:01.802
I got to get some loads in

08:01.803 --> 08:04.875
before I have to go to work.

08:04.876 --> 08:06.344
- Ugh.
- Just call V.

08:06.345 --> 08:07.446
You can use her washer.

08:07.447 --> 08:09.350
No V.

08:09.351 --> 08:11.187
What's wrong with V?

08:11.188 --> 08:12.824
I guess we're on the outs.

08:12.825 --> 08:15.496
We got into it pretty bad about
me not being there for her

08:15.497 --> 08:17.233
and her not givin' a shit about me,

08:17.234 --> 08:19.370
and we haven't spoken since.

08:19.371 --> 08:20.706
Don't start the wash.

08:20.707 --> 08:22.042
I need to throw in one of my shirts.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.745
- Can't.
- Washer's broken.

08:23.746 --> 08:25.984
What am I supposed to do about
my military-school interview?

08:25.985 --> 08:28.188
I can't go on there smelling
like one of Frank's homeless.

08:28.189 --> 08:29.690
You're still going through with that?

08:29.691 --> 08:31.896
Don't they check your GPA
for military school?

08:31.897 --> 08:34.400
Dom's dad wrote me a
killer recommendation.

08:36.172 --> 08:37.006
Who died?

08:37.006 --> 08:38.842
Another appliance.

08:38.844 --> 08:40.546
Oh, shit, the washing machine?

08:40.547 --> 08:42.751
Yeah, it's the one fucking
Jimmy bought for us.

08:42.751 --> 08:44.620
I should've known it would never last.

08:44.621 --> 08:46.892
I guess you're gonna have to
date another shithead con artist

08:46.893 --> 08:48.195
to replace it for us, huh?

08:48.196 --> 08:50.132
Somebody has to call to get this fixed,

08:50.133 --> 08:51.802
and it's not going to be me.

08:51.803 --> 08:53.205
What am I supposed to do about my shirt?

08:53.206 --> 08:55.810
Oh, uh, there's such a thing as a sink.

08:55.811 --> 08:57.881
Oh, Flintstones living up in here?

08:57.882 --> 08:59.517
Yo, where's Debs?

08:59.518 --> 09:00.854
I think she's avoidin' me

09:00.855 --> 09:02.089
'cause she doesn't have her portion

09:02.090 --> 09:03.491
of the monthly utilities.

09:03.492 --> 09:05.930
You are being kind of cunty about it.

09:05.931 --> 09:08.168
Yeah, she really thinks
you're gonna kick her out.

09:08.169 --> 09:09.938
Maybe you want to set her straight?

09:09.939 --> 09:12.209
Who says that I'm not?

09:12.210 --> 09:15.449
Somebody drop Liam at day care.
I got to hit the Laundromat.

09:15.450 --> 09:16.785
Yeah, I'll take him.

09:16.786 --> 09:18.255
Come on, bud.

09:18.256 --> 09:22.029
- Go, go, go, go, go.
- Straight cavemen.

09:27.775 --> 09:29.577
How are the books comin', Lana?

09:29.578 --> 09:31.982
Ah, much better with reduced overhead.

09:31.983 --> 09:33.819
Now we just have to collect running tabs

09:33.820 --> 09:35.222
from regulars who don't pay.

09:35.223 --> 09:36.892
Come on, fist bumps, kid. Fist bumps.

09:36.893 --> 09:40.399
Mommy, Mommy, and Daddy
are makin' money.

09:40.400 --> 09:41.734
Ha, breaking even.

09:41.735 --> 09:44.407
We are getting out of tax debt.

09:44.408 --> 09:46.744
Can we claim each other's
kids on our tax returns?

09:46.745 --> 09:48.515
We're married.

09:48.516 --> 09:50.185
We got tax returns?

09:50.186 --> 09:51.487
We can claim as dependents,

09:51.488 --> 09:53.024
but we would have to do adoption.

09:53.025 --> 09:54.427
Whose kids are we adopting?

09:54.428 --> 09:55.830
She and I would adopt each others'

09:55.831 --> 09:57.132
since we're married.

09:57.133 --> 09:58.501
We would save money on write-offs

09:58.502 --> 10:00.038
and become legitimate family.

10:00.039 --> 10:01.307
Wait, wait, wait.

10:01.308 --> 10:02.877
So, V adopts Yevgeny.

10:02.878 --> 10:05.716
Svetlana adopts Amy and Gemma.
Where does that leave me?

10:05.717 --> 10:08.189
That leaves you big, sexy
man in boxer shorts.

10:16.171 --> 10:18.074
He either said, "I
burnt your breakfast,"

10:18.075 --> 10:19.243
or, "I fucked up your eggs."

10:19.244 --> 10:20.479
He said, "Good morning."

10:20.480 --> 10:23.486
Hey.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.530
Fiona gone?

10:29.531 --> 10:31.034
She knows you're avoiding her.

10:31.035 --> 10:32.871
Don't feel like being
harassed about the bills.

10:32.872 --> 10:34.440
I still got two days to pay up.

10:34.441 --> 10:35.877
She's not really gonna kick you out.

10:35.878 --> 10:37.679
She just wants you to make an effort.

10:37.680 --> 10:39.050
She's a bitch.

10:39.051 --> 10:40.953
My stuff will be on the
street in 48 hours.

10:40.954 --> 10:43.058
I've got to find financial
security for me and Harry.

10:43.059 --> 10:44.560
All right, well, I'll
loan you the money.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.863
I get paid on Tuesday.

10:45.864 --> 10:48.168
Hmm, yeah, $372?

10:48.169 --> 10:50.138
You owe $372?

10:50.139 --> 10:52.811
What, is that baby formula made
out of caviar or something?

10:52.812 --> 10:54.713
It's cool. I'll get the money.

10:54.714 --> 10:58.221
I've got time. I can handle it.

10:58.222 --> 11:01.161
She's not gonna kick you out.

11:05.570 --> 11:07.239
Hot water?

11:07.240 --> 11:09.043
Thank God!

11:09.044 --> 11:12.449
Don't got to clean my flaps with
disinfectant wipes no more.

11:12.450 --> 11:15.355
Whoa.

11:15.356 --> 11:17.693
Uh, whoa.

11:19.464 --> 11:22.136
My family and unbathed brethren,

11:22.137 --> 11:24.808
we have won the first
battle for homeless dignity

11:24.809 --> 11:26.611
by staking our claim.

11:26.612 --> 11:29.216
We demanded our 40 acres and a mule,

11:29.217 --> 11:31.755
our three bedrooms and a toilet,

11:31.756 --> 11:34.560
and yours truly has
delivered it upon you.

11:34.561 --> 11:36.631
- Thank you very much.
- Great job, Frank!

11:36.632 --> 11:38.268
But... but listen,

11:38.269 --> 11:40.739
now... now that we got
the hot water turned on,

11:40.740 --> 11:43.144
we want to make sure that it stays on,

11:43.145 --> 11:44.480
and let's keep food

11:44.481 --> 11:47.486
and illicit substances in our belly.

11:47.487 --> 11:50.025
So I'm sending you out in groups

11:50.026 --> 11:53.933
to ply the most basic
commerce known to mankind...

11:53.934 --> 11:55.702
Begging, okay?

11:55.703 --> 11:57.974
You four, take the bodega.

11:57.975 --> 12:02.282
You three, uh, um, the dry cleaners.

12:02.283 --> 12:04.888
You, sir, you look like you
could use a touch of grooming,

12:04.889 --> 12:07.226
so let's send you to the barbershop.

12:07.227 --> 12:09.263
Okay, let's go.

12:09.264 --> 12:11.300
Other people's money waits for no man.

12:11.301 --> 12:12.469
Go out there.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.474
Give 'em homeless! Yeah!

12:16.078 --> 12:18.514
I don't understand why
you're not on board.

12:18.515 --> 12:20.485
It's just the whole
lesbian-wedding thing again.

12:20.486 --> 12:22.991
You and Svetlana are a thing,
and I'm the third wheel.

12:22.992 --> 12:25.195
It is just paperwork
to secure more money

12:25.196 --> 12:26.697
for Amy and Gemma.

12:26.698 --> 12:28.501
What if somethin' happens to us?

12:28.502 --> 12:30.672
Svetlana will be able
to take care of 'em.

12:30.673 --> 12:32.509
I thought you wanted Fiona
to take care of 'em

12:32.510 --> 12:33.879
if somethin' happened to us?

12:33.880 --> 12:35.682
Fiona only cares about herself anymore.

12:35.683 --> 12:38.822
Oh, would you please?
Fiona's your best friend.

12:38.823 --> 12:41.294
We have the key to her
house, And I'm pretty sure

12:41.295 --> 12:43.298
that half our clothes
in our closet are hers.

12:43.299 --> 12:45.335
- Then I'll take 'em back.
- Is this a permanent thing

12:45.336 --> 12:47.673
between you two, or is it
until one of you caves

12:47.674 --> 12:49.743
- and apologizes?
- Screw Fiona!

12:49.744 --> 12:51.480
It's time for us to move on and think

12:51.481 --> 12:53.351
about what's best of our
family, and that's Svetlana.

12:53.352 --> 12:55.188
Adoption will give our kids stability.

12:55.189 --> 12:58.127
Don't you want them to have more
than what we had growin' up?

12:58.128 --> 13:01.033
I still get to be called
"Daddy" no matter what.

13:01.034 --> 13:03.438
- Or Big Papa.
- Oh!

13:03.439 --> 13:05.609
Your choice, baby.

13:07.013 --> 13:09.683
Chicks in uniform rule.

13:09.684 --> 13:11.888
Not into dudes,

13:11.889 --> 13:13.725
especially the teenage kind.

13:13.726 --> 13:17.065
Save your compliments.

13:17.066 --> 13:19.871
Impressive letter of
recommendation, Mr. Gallagher.

13:19.872 --> 13:21.842
I know some people.

13:21.843 --> 13:23.745
You should definitely reapply next year.

13:23.746 --> 13:25.315
We're at capacity this fall.

13:25.316 --> 13:29.323
All 75 slots for this upcoming
term have been filled.

13:29.324 --> 13:30.926
Wait, so that's it? No interview?

13:30.927 --> 13:33.264
We'll definitely keep
your application on file.

13:33.265 --> 13:34.768
Well, the brochure says

13:34.769 --> 13:37.038
that incoming classes have 100 students.

13:37.039 --> 13:39.343
The remaining slots are reserved

13:39.344 --> 13:40.678
for students of color.

13:40.679 --> 13:42.549
We try to strongly encourage

13:42.550 --> 13:44.520
the underrepresented groups to apply...

13:44.521 --> 13:47.392
Native Americans, Pacific
Islanders, Hispanic,

13:47.393 --> 13:49.129
and, of course, African-Americans.

13:49.130 --> 13:51.567
I'm part black.

13:51.568 --> 13:53.304
Black Irish doesn't count.

13:53.305 --> 13:56.744
We'll contact you if
anything becomes available.

13:56.745 --> 13:58.414
Marco Nunez, you're up.

14:02.723 --> 14:04.994
Go fuck yourself, Pancho.

14:14.782 --> 14:16.183
Slow mornin', Etta?

14:16.184 --> 14:18.789
Change machine's out of quarters.

14:18.790 --> 14:20.692
I brought quarters.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.763
Some of your machines
are broken, too, huh?

14:22.764 --> 14:27.138
Ah, people keep using slugs
so they won't have to pay.

14:27.139 --> 14:28.407
They get jammed in there

14:28.408 --> 14:31.313
tighter than a string bikini in my ass.

14:31.314 --> 14:34.119
I ain't fishin' 'em out.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.421
My load's not done.

14:35.422 --> 14:37.627
I need change for a dollar.

14:40.099 --> 14:42.303
There's your change.

14:47.748 --> 14:49.082
Gave her too much change.

14:49.083 --> 14:50.886
I did?

14:50.887 --> 14:52.556
You wouldn't have to deal with quarters

14:52.557 --> 14:53.691
if you got swipe cards.

14:53.692 --> 14:55.728
Tell that to the new owners.

14:55.729 --> 14:58.301
Not that they'd care anyway.

14:58.302 --> 14:59.871
You're sellin' the place?

14:59.872 --> 15:02.075
Ah, those North Side suits...

15:02.076 --> 15:05.415
They've been pokin' around,
trying to buy out my lease.

15:05.416 --> 15:08.154
I think they're trying to
rack up the whole block.

15:08.155 --> 15:11.226
I told 'em to get lost.

15:11.227 --> 15:12.930
What do they want to do with it?

15:12.931 --> 15:15.068
Turn it into a Starbucks

15:15.069 --> 15:18.574
or... or a cheese and wine shop.

15:18.575 --> 15:22.315
I-I can't handle this
place since Wendell died.

15:22.316 --> 15:25.088
You know, we tripled customers
over at Patsy's when we updated.

15:25.089 --> 15:28.094
I'm too old for that.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.966
Worried about my babies, though.

15:30.967 --> 15:33.305
Seriously? The cats?

15:35.542 --> 15:37.612
Kittie's gettin' her thrills, huh?

15:37.613 --> 15:41.888
The newbies around here don't
understand the South Side.

15:41.889 --> 15:44.292
You and me... the lifers...

15:44.293 --> 15:45.963
We still get it.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.775
Just rented this
new space yesterday,

15:51.776 --> 15:54.346
and I need you to order 25 desks,

15:54.347 --> 15:55.749
5 printers, scanners,

15:55.750 --> 15:57.652
make sure the Trinity
gets the swivel seats

15:57.653 --> 15:58.955
with the nice butt cushion.

15:58.956 --> 16:00.692
Uh, need a new espresso machine,

16:00.693 --> 16:02.529
the Breville 870XL,

16:02.530 --> 16:04.767
and a treadmill desk for Joe an...

16:04.768 --> 16:07.138
- You jotting this down?
- Yeah, yeah, no, I got it.

16:07.139 --> 16:08.607
All right, got to pimp
this place back out, man.

16:08.608 --> 16:10.044
We lost a quarter of our staff,

16:10.045 --> 16:11.480
so we need you to get
everyone back on the network.

16:11.481 --> 16:13.050
Lost a quarter of our staff, huh?

16:13.051 --> 16:14.854
Yep.

16:14.855 --> 16:16.825
And your intern got scared
off, so you're gonna have

16:16.826 --> 16:18.694
to hire a new one and
fetch your own lunch.

16:18.695 --> 16:21.366
Mine too.

16:21.367 --> 16:23.872
Yeah, Game Change is
back up and running.

16:25.542 --> 16:28.080
<i>* Hey, you'll finally be free now *</i>

16:29.417 --> 16:31.520
<i>* Take it slow *</i>

16:31.521 --> 16:33.224
<i>* Let that beat take you home *</i>

16:33.225 --> 16:34.526
Good, Candice.

16:34.527 --> 16:37.699
Fifty bucks is a great start,

16:37.700 --> 16:40.338
but, um, we got to talk about technique

16:40.339 --> 16:43.077
to increase our profits.

16:43.078 --> 16:45.081
Oh, an out-of-work vet

16:45.082 --> 16:48.254
is worth at least 40
bucks an hour, Hector.

16:48.255 --> 16:50.525
You're gon... try to
triple this, all right?

16:50.526 --> 16:52.797
And, please, just say no to pennies.

16:54.367 --> 16:57.071
Frank, I need to speak with you.

16:57.072 --> 16:58.909
Well, well, well...

16:58.910 --> 17:01.313
the prodigal daughter returns.

17:01.314 --> 17:02.983
How do I make some money, fast?

17:02.984 --> 17:05.087
No, no, no, no, no, no free advice

17:05.088 --> 17:07.692
- for Gallagher traitors.
- Come on, Frank.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.061
You've been hustlin' your entire life.

17:09.063 --> 17:10.431
I need expertise.

17:10.432 --> 17:12.502
I already have a Debbie

17:12.502 --> 17:15.241
to bestow my gentle wisdom upon.

17:15.242 --> 17:17.111
- Yes, Daddy Frank?
- You see?

17:17.112 --> 17:19.348
She knows who the real papa is.

17:19.349 --> 17:21.855
- Isn't that a boy?
- Not to me.

17:21.856 --> 17:23.223
Well, what about your granddaughter?

17:23.224 --> 17:24.626
Don't you care what happens to her?

17:24.627 --> 17:27.365
Oh, you mean that strange mixed-race kid

17:27.366 --> 17:28.969
with the butch name?

17:28.970 --> 17:30.940
What if I change her
name back to Franny?

17:32.476 --> 17:34.814
Franny for life? No take-backs.

17:34.815 --> 17:36.717
Fine.

17:36.718 --> 17:39.489
Come here. Can I pick you up?

17:39.490 --> 17:41.627
Oh, I've missed you. Yes, yes, yes.

17:41.628 --> 17:43.430
How much cash we talkin' about?

17:43.431 --> 17:45.601
Three hundred and seventy-two
dollars in 48 hours.

17:45.602 --> 17:47.472
Well, that's a fast turnaround.

17:47.473 --> 17:48.875
I hope you're good at hand jobs.

17:48.876 --> 17:50.611
I don't know.

17:50.612 --> 17:53.785
Got to shake a lot of snakes to
come up with that kind of dough.

17:53.786 --> 17:57.692
Anything that doesn't involve
touching male anatomy?

17:57.693 --> 18:00.933
Oh, good sign, Morris.

18:00.934 --> 18:03.037
- Yeah.
- Shouldn't that be "homeless"?

18:03.038 --> 18:05.374
No, spelling deficiency
is good for the cause.

18:05.375 --> 18:08.782
You know, you're really
wasting your best assets.

18:08.783 --> 18:12.088
Young, white, mother, female.

18:12.089 --> 18:13.457
You're a cash cow on the corner.

18:13.458 --> 18:15.594
You want me to be a prostitute?

18:15.595 --> 18:17.598
No, don't be ridiculous.

18:17.599 --> 18:19.971
Competition is way too steep,

18:19.972 --> 18:23.110
but stick a sign with you
and a baby in your arms

18:23.111 --> 18:27.118
and just watch the
middle-class pity roll in.

18:27.119 --> 18:28.989
- Go.
- Begging?

18:28.990 --> 18:30.759
Yep. Hey.

18:33.866 --> 18:35.134
Hey.

18:35.135 --> 18:37.305
Got your text. What's up?

18:37.306 --> 18:39.376
Uh, grab a bag.

18:39.377 --> 18:41.179
- This for Frank's shelter?
- Yeah.

18:41.180 --> 18:43.318
One of my teens from the
youth center is moving in.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.458
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:47.459 --> 18:49.662
Ian, this is Gia.

18:49.663 --> 18:51.666
Hi. Appreciate it.

18:51.667 --> 18:53.504
Not as strong as I look.

18:53.505 --> 18:55.810
These shits are heavy.

18:57.947 --> 19:00.317
Cute and got manners?

19:00.318 --> 19:02.488
Nice.

19:02.489 --> 19:04.359
Gia got kicked out of the house.

19:04.360 --> 19:06.530
We're lucky the shelter had some space.

19:06.531 --> 19:07.966
Hey, Frank didn't give him too much shit

19:07.967 --> 19:09.335
about moving in, did he?

19:09.336 --> 19:10.939
Gia's a her, not a him.

19:10.940 --> 19:12.275
Her proper pronoun is "she."

19:12.276 --> 19:14.145
Your dad's a local hero.

19:14.146 --> 19:17.285
Well, Frank is a Frank, not a dad,

19:17.286 --> 19:18.855
and his proper pronoun is "it."

19:18.856 --> 19:21.961
We, uh... we hangin' tonight?

19:21.962 --> 19:23.398
Hope so.

19:36.892 --> 19:38.360
<i>* And the boss *</i>

19:38.361 --> 19:40.932
<i>* Of your will is extreme *</i>

19:40.933 --> 19:43.771
<i>* And you cannot be stopped *</i>

19:43.772 --> 19:46.076
<i>* You have to hang around *</i>

19:46.077 --> 19:48.247
- <i>* And desecrate the town. *</i>
- Jesus!

19:48.248 --> 19:49.783
<i>* I said it... *</i>

19:49.784 --> 19:51.052
Sorry.

19:51.053 --> 19:52.421
Uh, what are you doin' here?

19:52.422 --> 19:54.559
Uh, lookin' for Margo.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.029
Is this still her office?

19:56.030 --> 19:59.136
Uh, she's out for a deposition today.

20:00.605 --> 20:01.974
What's the problem?

20:01.975 --> 20:03.577
No problem.

20:03.578 --> 20:06.650
I just came to report that
Patsy's is doing great.

20:06.651 --> 20:08.654
We've been overcrowded
on our off shifts,

20:08.655 --> 20:10.424
and our nighttime crowds are so heavy,

20:10.425 --> 20:12.261
we have to take names for tables.

20:12.262 --> 20:14.499
- Good work.
- Thanks.

20:14.500 --> 20:17.305
I got a lot more ideas,
but I'd like to discuss

20:17.306 --> 20:19.142
me gettin' a reasonable cut.

20:19.143 --> 20:20.979
Cut of what?

20:20.980 --> 20:22.582
The profits,

20:22.583 --> 20:24.820
seein' as how I'm the
reason that they increased.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.529
On what planet do diner managers

20:29.530 --> 20:31.600
get a cut of the business profits?

20:31.601 --> 20:33.003
I turned that place around.

20:33.004 --> 20:34.706
Yeah, so we wouldn't close it down.

20:34.707 --> 20:37.445
I worked 24-7 and got it jumpin'.

20:37.446 --> 20:39.382
That's above and beyond manager.

20:39.383 --> 20:41.286
I busted my ass on that shit diner,

20:41.287 --> 20:42.990
and I'm not gettin' paid what I'm worth.

20:42.991 --> 20:44.692
Join the club.

20:44.693 --> 20:47.698
Nobody making a paycheck is
paid what they're worth.

20:47.699 --> 20:49.636
Look, you have to own
something to make real money,

20:49.637 --> 20:51.775
and Margo's the only owner around here.

20:54.981 --> 20:57.351
Fine. What about an
additional 50 bucks a week?

20:57.352 --> 20:59.355
You just got a raise.

20:59.356 --> 21:01.526
Not gonna happen.

21:03.631 --> 21:06.603
<i>* You're just a wreckin' machine *</i>

21:06.604 --> 21:10.611
<i>* You don't know what
you're doin' to me *</i>

21:10.612 --> 21:14.519
<i>* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *</i>

21:14.520 --> 21:17.525
So who's married to whom?

21:17.526 --> 21:19.562
- We're married...
- To each other.

21:19.563 --> 21:22.034
But we still have relationship
with all three of us.

21:22.035 --> 21:23.537
I'm Big Papa.

21:23.538 --> 21:25.741
And who's adopting whom?

21:25.742 --> 21:27.078
She's adopting our daughters.

21:27.079 --> 21:29.382
She's adopting son I have with jailbird.

21:29.383 --> 21:31.887
- And that's him?
- No, this is Big Papa.

21:31.888 --> 21:33.490
He's a good daddy and a good husband.

21:33.491 --> 21:34.893
Jailbird in jail.

21:34.894 --> 21:38.734
Not daddy anymore. New daddy, Big Papa.

21:38.735 --> 21:40.371
Huh, fascinating.

21:40.372 --> 21:41.406
A-a-and your triplets?

21:41.407 --> 21:43.911
My son, their daughters.

21:43.912 --> 21:45.681
So weird how we have to keep explaining

21:45.682 --> 21:47.351
our situation to people.

21:47.352 --> 21:48.788
It's like they never heard
of a menage-a-three.

21:48.789 --> 21:50.825
This may be the most
exciting adoption case

21:50.826 --> 21:52.461
this firm has ever seen.

21:52.462 --> 21:54.565
I mean, I'll be the face
of the modern family.

21:54.566 --> 21:58.039
- This is career changing.
- So we negotiate discount fee

21:58.040 --> 21:59.642
for mutual benefit.

21:59.643 --> 22:00.912
Let's get the paperwork started

22:00.913 --> 22:02.548
to begin the application process.

22:02.549 --> 22:03.885
You'll need to gather

22:03.886 --> 22:05.521
all of your health-care information

22:05.522 --> 22:06.824
to build your case file,

22:06.825 --> 22:08.160
and the same for the children.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.164
All of their checkups, immunizations,

22:10.165 --> 22:11.566
MMR vaccines.

22:11.567 --> 22:13.871
Uh...

22:13.872 --> 22:16.510
- MMR vaccine?
- Not now, Kev.

22:27.732 --> 22:29.202
What do you want?

22:29.203 --> 22:30.972
I didn't get into military school, sir.

22:30.973 --> 22:32.943
You fail the drug test?

22:32.944 --> 22:34.378
No.

22:34.379 --> 22:37.819
Said the only slots left
were for colored people.

22:37.820 --> 22:39.957
People of color, son.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.459
Don't say "colored people."

22:41.460 --> 22:42.829
That's reverse racism.

22:42.830 --> 22:44.265
So what you call all the white slots?

22:44.266 --> 22:46.402
Reverse reverse racism?

22:46.403 --> 22:48.106
Well, I told 'em I was part black.

22:48.107 --> 22:50.110
They didn't believe me.
You've met my brother, Liam.

22:50.111 --> 22:52.248
Somebody in my families been
dipping in the chocolate.

22:52.249 --> 22:53.617
Can you write me another letter?

22:53.618 --> 22:55.454
Tell 'em I qualify for a diversity slot?

22:55.455 --> 22:58.260
You want me to vouch for your blackness?

22:58.261 --> 23:00.063
If it wouldn't be too much trouble.

23:00.064 --> 23:01.599
I don't know what you are, Gallagher...

23:01.600 --> 23:03.637
Part black, part white, part dipshit.

23:03.638 --> 23:05.942
Any asshole can claim
black by convenience.

23:05.943 --> 23:09.081
- It's not fair, sir.
- White man's burden, son.

23:09.082 --> 23:12.321
Until there's some genuine
racial balance out there,

23:12.322 --> 23:14.826
you got to take the short
end of the diversity stick.

23:14.827 --> 23:17.264
Well, where am I supposed
to learn to be a real man?

23:17.265 --> 23:20.003
I'm gonna be stuck in this hood forever.

23:20.004 --> 23:21.739
<i>* I ain't got no money *</i>

23:21.740 --> 23:24.579
<i>* Money *</i>

23:24.580 --> 23:26.817
<i>* I can't take you to no ball *</i>

23:26.818 --> 23:28.119
<i>* Go ahead and say somethin' to me *</i>

23:28.120 --> 23:29.622
<i>* Tell me you love me *</i>

23:29.623 --> 23:31.359
<i>* Take it all in, take it all *</i>

23:31.360 --> 23:32.661
<i>* No, that's sad, girl, shake it off *</i>

23:32.662 --> 23:34.432
<i>* Shake it off *</i>

23:34.433 --> 23:36.436
<i>* Baby, you know what I want *</i>

23:36.437 --> 23:37.872
<i>* Ooh *</i>

23:37.873 --> 23:39.141
<i>* Shake it *</i>

23:39.142 --> 23:40.778
<i>* You know just what I need *</i>

23:40.779 --> 23:43.116
<i>* Don't you? *</i>

23:43.117 --> 23:44.987
<i>* And I just want to do it at all *</i>

23:44.988 --> 23:46.824
<i>* Ooh, honey *</i>

23:46.825 --> 23:48.560
<i>* I know it was you *</i>

23:48.561 --> 23:52.668
<i>* Baby, baby, please do it for me *</i>

23:58.849 --> 24:00.684
<i>* La, la, la, yes *</i>

24:00.685 --> 24:02.488
<i>* Shake it, shake it, shake it *</i>

24:07.365 --> 24:09.535
Ugh, two arson victims,

24:09.536 --> 24:11.272
a 35-year-old heart attack,

24:11.273 --> 24:13.143
and a projectile-vomiting
three-year-old,

24:13.144 --> 24:14.612
and it's not even five o'clock.

24:14.613 --> 24:16.015
Yep.

24:16.016 --> 24:17.718
How's your stain coming?

24:17.719 --> 24:19.890
Gonna need something
stronger than baby wipes.

24:19.891 --> 24:21.526
That kid got you good.

24:21.527 --> 24:23.964
It's not my first time
wearing projectile vomit.

24:23.965 --> 24:25.902
Usually there's cheap
beer and fists involved.

24:25.903 --> 24:27.471
Oh, we're all hittin'
up the bar after work.

24:27.472 --> 24:29.008
- You want to come?
- Ah, no, I'm supposed

24:29.009 --> 24:30.677
to meet up with a new friend later.

24:30.678 --> 24:33.483
A new friend, huh?

24:33.484 --> 24:35.687
Sounds like a rebound.

24:35.688 --> 24:37.558
You got to go slow.

24:37.559 --> 24:39.161
My last rebound

24:39.162 --> 24:40.998
slashed the tires of
the rig I was workin'.

24:40.999 --> 24:42.434
I had a patient in the back

24:42.435 --> 24:44.405
with a Coke bottle shoved up his ass.

24:44.406 --> 24:46.844
Not a rebound, all right?

24:46.845 --> 24:48.279
Just a guy I met.

24:48.280 --> 24:49.482
His name's Trevor.

24:49.483 --> 24:51.018
He's a lot of fun to hang out with.

24:51.019 --> 24:53.022
It's just platonic.

24:53.023 --> 24:54.960
There's no such thing as platonic.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.529
You're either bonin',

24:56.530 --> 24:58.233
or you're waitin' to bone.

24:58.234 --> 25:00.470
See, that's why I only hang
out with my coworkers,

25:00.471 --> 25:02.007
'cause after a day on the rig

25:02.008 --> 25:03.409
wearin' everybody's piss and vomit,

25:03.410 --> 25:04.846
- none of us are fuckable.
- What?

25:04.847 --> 25:06.315
- No offense.
- Oh.

25:06.316 --> 25:09.355
No, trust me, this
friend is just a friend.

25:09.356 --> 25:11.592
Can't be any other way.

25:11.593 --> 25:15.902
Is that your strictly
friend there texting?

25:15.903 --> 25:18.540
Address to a yard party tonight.

25:18.541 --> 25:21.948
Bonin' or waitin' to bone, Gallagher.

25:33.704 --> 25:35.740
- Yo, we connected yet?
- Uh, nah.

25:35.741 --> 25:39.081
I need someone to log in to
complete the network setup.

25:39.082 --> 25:41.652
All right.

25:46.230 --> 25:47.731
There.

25:47.732 --> 25:49.435
Create a temporary
password and get it done.

25:49.436 --> 25:51.372
Once we're back on, start
tweeting from our account.

25:51.373 --> 25:52.843
Folks need to know we're alive.

25:54.746 --> 25:57.451
So one second the offices
are getting raided by the Feds,

25:57.452 --> 26:00.791
and the next we're here

26:00.792 --> 26:02.929
like nothin' happened.

26:02.930 --> 26:04.265
How do you guys stay afloat?

26:04.266 --> 26:06.904
By makin' a shit-ton of money.

26:06.905 --> 26:08.774
Think we don't budget
for that kind of crap?

26:08.775 --> 26:10.744
It's part of the business plan.

26:10.745 --> 26:13.449
Like, the first time we
were alive, 14 months.

26:13.450 --> 26:15.988
This time it was 20. Called progress.

26:15.989 --> 26:18.092
Yeah, but won't you guys just
end up gettin' busted again?

26:18.093 --> 26:20.230
No, there's no crime in fantasy sports

26:20.231 --> 26:21.967
and processing credit cards.

26:21.968 --> 26:24.406
The Feds can try and fight it
till they're blue in the face.

26:27.078 --> 26:29.148
Hey, so I was thinkin', you know,

26:29.149 --> 26:31.987
since we got less staff now, um...

26:31.988 --> 26:33.623
you know, any chance
maybe I could get paid?

26:33.624 --> 26:36.329
Sarah's Pomeranian needs to be

26:36.330 --> 26:38.969
at the groomer before lunch.

26:40.839 --> 26:42.675
Got it.

26:51.126 --> 26:52.561
Since we're gonna be new parents,

26:52.562 --> 26:54.631
we should probably all
have the same last name.

26:54.632 --> 26:55.835
How about Kev's?

26:55.836 --> 26:57.637
Great. We'll all be Balls.

26:57.638 --> 26:59.408
Pregnant again, V? Congrats.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.744
I'm not pregnant.

27:00.745 --> 27:02.180
We're adopting each other's kids.

27:02.181 --> 27:03.917
Adoptin' kids you already have?

27:03.918 --> 27:05.487
You want to take some of
mine while you're at it?

27:05.488 --> 27:07.591
Did we get the kids the MMR shot?

27:07.592 --> 27:09.261
Isn't that linked to autism?

27:09.262 --> 27:11.098
In Russia, we don't do vaccines.

27:11.099 --> 27:13.503
In winter, we send baby
out to nap in cold.

27:13.504 --> 27:15.273
It gets immune to virus.

27:15.274 --> 27:18.646
So the doctors inject
the babies with a virus

27:18.647 --> 27:20.683
to prevent the virus, but does that mean

27:20.684 --> 27:22.889
that they give 'em a virus
that they didn't already have?

27:22.890 --> 27:26.228
The government did that to black
soldiers with penicillin.

27:26.229 --> 27:28.699
Gave 'em syphilis. A lot of 'em died.

27:28.700 --> 27:30.570
Government wants to give
our babies syphilis?

27:30.571 --> 27:32.074
My sister gave her kid that shot.

27:32.075 --> 27:33.912
Now he just hides in
the corner and hums...

27:35.381 --> 27:38.086
Vaccines are the greatest
medical invention

27:38.087 --> 27:39.388
of all time.

27:39.389 --> 27:43.196
No polio, no smallpox, no measles.

27:43.197 --> 27:46.001
You want your kids to end
up with scarlet fever?

27:46.002 --> 27:48.673
- Used to kill thousands.
- Sounds bad.

27:48.674 --> 27:50.845
- It was bad.
- It's not as safe as they say.

27:50.846 --> 27:52.347
Better than polio.

27:52.348 --> 27:53.951
So we experiment.

27:53.952 --> 27:55.821
Don't give vaccine to
all babies, just some.

27:55.822 --> 27:57.825
See what happens.

28:02.535 --> 28:04.238
- This is like my family.
- Yeah.

28:04.239 --> 28:06.308
It's like a family. Highs
and lows, right, ladies?

28:06.309 --> 28:07.879
- A lot of highs.
- A lot of lows.

28:07.880 --> 28:09.749
You're a real people's
champion, Mr. Gallagher.

28:09.750 --> 28:11.152
- Thank you.
- If there's more you need,

28:11.153 --> 28:12.554
please don't hesitate

28:12.555 --> 28:14.258
to let Elena and the organization know.

28:14.259 --> 28:16.562
Well, good sir, since
you're so generous,

28:16.563 --> 28:17.999
we could use a new television

28:18.000 --> 28:20.771
to keep us distracted from the drugs...

28:20.772 --> 28:22.942
and a microwave, new refrigerator,

28:22.943 --> 28:25.881
some appliances, maybe
a furniture upgrade.

28:25.882 --> 28:27.551
- We'll send some things over.
- Thank you.

28:27.552 --> 28:29.721
Now, which ones of these kids are yours?

28:29.722 --> 28:31.192
Want to make sure they
get in the picture.

28:31.193 --> 28:34.464
Oh, this is little Liam right here.

28:34.465 --> 28:36.235
Hey, there.

28:36.236 --> 28:38.439
Nice smile, son.

28:38.440 --> 28:41.111
Okay, show 'em your pearly browns.

28:54.606 --> 28:56.843
- Here's your check.
- Thank you.

28:56.844 --> 28:58.112
Hi.

28:58.113 --> 29:00.216
Sixteen dollars and eighty-three cents.

29:00.217 --> 29:02.220
Take it off my tab, and
I'll be back with more,

29:02.221 --> 29:03.623
so don't touch my things.

29:03.624 --> 29:07.765
<i>* Oh, oh, oh *</i>

29:07.766 --> 29:11.139
<i>* Oh, oh, oh *</i>

29:15.714 --> 29:18.486
Gallagher.

29:18.487 --> 29:20.590
Been looking for you.

29:20.591 --> 29:22.227
As much as an annoying

29:22.228 --> 29:24.431
and otherwise rodent-like pest

29:24.432 --> 29:27.671
you've become in my daughter's life...

29:27.672 --> 29:30.109
I've grown to feel a sense
of responsibility for you.

29:30.110 --> 29:32.113
Military school might be your best shot

29:32.114 --> 29:33.850
to avoid being human scum.

29:33.851 --> 29:35.687
You're gonna vouch for my blackness?

29:35.688 --> 29:37.958
Still no.

29:37.959 --> 29:41.131
But you can take a DNA test to
prove your African ancestry.

29:41.132 --> 29:43.135
All it takes is an oral
swab of your cheek.

29:43.136 --> 29:45.039
They swab my ass cheeks?

29:45.040 --> 29:46.843
Oral, Gallagher.

29:46.844 --> 29:48.546
That's the mouth.

29:48.547 --> 29:50.149
Oh, cool.

29:50.150 --> 29:52.555
Pick you up at 10 a. m. sharp.

30:04.145 --> 30:05.680
Debbie?

30:07.819 --> 30:09.721
Hey, Tanya, what's up?

30:09.722 --> 30:11.225
What are you doing out here?

30:11.226 --> 30:13.195
Just raisin' money for Franny.

30:13.196 --> 30:15.032
Job scarcity, and nobody's hiring.

30:15.033 --> 30:16.268
Crazy, right?

30:16.269 --> 30:18.707
Got any spare change?

30:20.611 --> 30:22.782
Do you need help or something?

30:22.783 --> 30:24.886
Or, like, a babysitter?

30:24.887 --> 30:26.455
No, we're fine.

30:26.456 --> 30:28.259
Just doing whatever it takes.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.264
If you talk to Derek,
tell him I said hi.

30:33.470 --> 30:36.276
I'll see you later.

30:37.711 --> 30:38.780
Hey...

30:38.781 --> 30:41.385
my corner, freckle face.

30:41.386 --> 30:42.620
Excuse me?

30:42.621 --> 30:45.293
Pack up your stuff and get lost.

30:45.294 --> 30:46.963
This belongs to me and my baby.

30:46.964 --> 30:48.834
I've still got 355 bucks to earn.

30:48.835 --> 30:50.603
Find another fuckin' corner.

30:50.604 --> 30:54.711
Oh, no, you know what? I
think I'll keep this one.

30:56.416 --> 30:59.421
- What are you doing?
- Marking my territory.

30:59.422 --> 31:01.525
So am I, bitch.

31:01.526 --> 31:03.362
- No, no, no!
- Hey!

31:06.937 --> 31:08.038
Oh!

31:11.246 --> 31:12.113
Back off!

31:12.114 --> 31:13.549
Ooh!

31:19.395 --> 31:21.431
You're a terrible person!

31:34.358 --> 31:35.928
- Hey.
- Hey.

31:35.929 --> 31:37.497
You get a quote on the washer?

31:37.498 --> 31:38.934
Uh, I didn't have time today.

31:38.935 --> 31:40.369
Can't you handle it?

31:40.370 --> 31:42.841
I was serious about not
taking this house shit on.

31:42.842 --> 31:44.979
I'll pay my fair share of
whatever it costs to fix it,

31:44.980 --> 31:46.783
but until then, I'll
keep taking my quarters

31:46.784 --> 31:49.087
to Etta's at the 'mat.

32:07.024 --> 32:08.258
- Uh-huh!
<i>- * I say *</i>

32:15.207 --> 32:17.978
This DJ's wild. Whose place is this?

32:17.979 --> 32:19.180
My friend Kali.

32:19.181 --> 32:21.685
She's a legendary party promoter.

32:21.686 --> 32:24.691
She even planned one for
Prince in Paisley Park.

32:26.362 --> 32:28.800
It's been a while since I had
someone to party-hop with.

32:30.003 --> 32:31.538
I miss this shit.

32:31.539 --> 32:34.544
It's good to see you let
your hair down, Red.

32:36.750 --> 32:38.018
<i>* I say *</i>

32:40.424 --> 32:41.491
<i>* I say *</i>

32:44.198 --> 32:45.166
<i>* I say *</i>

32:48.006 --> 32:50.176
I turned around profits at the diner,

32:50.177 --> 32:54.284
and I asked for a raise, but
how can I ensure my future?

32:54.285 --> 32:56.789
Well, you might want
to consider a SEP IRA

32:56.790 --> 32:59.895
or a Roth IRA to prepare
for the long term.

32:59.896 --> 33:02.066
I'm surprised you messaged me again.

33:02.067 --> 33:03.669
I know.

33:03.670 --> 33:06.408
My rule's one time, but I
could really use the tips,

33:06.409 --> 33:08.078
and, you know, you're a great lay.

33:08.079 --> 33:10.316
No problem.

33:10.317 --> 33:12.855
You might also want to consider bonds.

33:12.856 --> 33:14.992
Some low risk, high yield.

33:14.993 --> 33:17.998
Perhaps something more aggressive.

33:17.999 --> 33:20.336
I can do all this stuff
on a manager's salary?

33:20.337 --> 33:23.777
Investing and ownership is
really the only way to go

33:23.778 --> 33:26.081
from being poor to rich.

33:26.082 --> 33:28.218
- Ownership?
- Yeah.

33:28.219 --> 33:30.523
Anybody who's really
rich, owns something.

33:30.524 --> 33:32.528
Or lots of something.

33:35.467 --> 33:37.603
Next time, we can just
meet in my office.

33:37.604 --> 33:39.909
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

33:39.910 --> 33:43.282
Three hundred thirty-seven
dollars per pint of blood.

33:43.283 --> 33:46.555
I could sell two pints before
my body goes into shock.

33:46.556 --> 33:48.058
Ugh. Nah, you're right.

33:48.059 --> 33:50.062
That would only last
us a couple of months.

33:50.063 --> 33:53.269
Ten dollars per square inch of skin.

33:54.371 --> 33:57.343
Seems kind of low.

33:57.344 --> 33:59.380
We still have time. I am
not going to let Fiona

33:59.381 --> 34:01.284
kick us to the curb.

34:01.285 --> 34:05.360
How much for one cornea?

34:21.726 --> 34:23.594
Had some of your things at my house,

34:23.596 --> 34:26.333
so I thought I'd bring 'em by.

34:26.335 --> 34:27.971
Oh, those fit you better
than they fit me anyway.

34:27.972 --> 34:29.641
You can just keep 'em.

34:29.641 --> 34:32.079
Not sure what you want to do
with the spare key, but...

34:32.080 --> 34:33.614
I can bring by your stuff later.

34:33.616 --> 34:35.351
No need. Kev will pick it up.

34:35.353 --> 34:37.489
- Fine.
- Cool.

34:37.491 --> 34:38.960
- Hey, V.
- Hey.

34:38.960 --> 34:41.431
Sorry. Kev put that one
in with the colors.

34:41.431 --> 34:42.632
Ah, it's okay.

34:42.634 --> 34:44.137
- Thanks.
- No problem.

34:44.138 --> 34:45.775
That's what friends do for each other.

34:49.983 --> 34:52.553
Jesus, any colder in here,
we're gonna need parkas.

34:52.554 --> 34:53.790
What's with you and V?

34:53.791 --> 34:55.292
Really couldn't go to the Laundromat

34:55.293 --> 34:56.996
just like everyone else?

34:56.996 --> 34:58.332
Well, just 'cause you
want to ice everyone out

34:58.333 --> 35:00.002
doesn't mean I have to.

35:00.003 --> 35:02.006
- What's up with you?
- What's up with me?

35:02.007 --> 35:03.742
I'm workin' around the clock.

35:03.743 --> 35:06.147
I'm doin' great. What's up with you?

35:06.148 --> 35:08.753
Jesus, how hard can
managing a fucking diner be

35:08.754 --> 35:10.489
for you to stop giving
a shit about us and V?

35:10.490 --> 35:12.460
Who says I don't give a shit?

35:12.461 --> 35:16.034
I'm not gonna apologize for
gettin' my life together.

35:16.035 --> 35:18.940
V will be fine once she
realizes that self-improvement

35:18.941 --> 35:20.878
is not a crime, and so will all of you.

35:33.669 --> 35:34.872
Guys, watch your backs.

35:34.873 --> 35:37.310
You fuckin' seein' this?

35:38.413 --> 35:39.748
Is that a new washer/dryer

35:39.749 --> 35:41.251
gettin' delivered to Frank?

35:41.252 --> 35:43.523
Even the homeless get
better stuff than us.

35:51.605 --> 35:53.608
Okay, so which one

35:53.609 --> 35:55.712
of you little titans is
getting vaccinated first?

35:55.713 --> 35:58.351
This one's first. She
gets the whole bundle.

35:58.352 --> 35:59.788
None for her, and for the boy,

35:59.789 --> 36:02.394
can we get, like, half of 'em?

36:11.045 --> 36:12.313
- Oh, shit.
- Hey!

36:12.314 --> 36:14.383
- Yo, bro.
- Jesus.

36:14.384 --> 36:15.887
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What's up, dude?

36:15.888 --> 36:17.022
Nah, nah, we're... We're good here.

36:17.023 --> 36:18.525
Yeah?

36:18.526 --> 36:19.660
So, uh, catch you later?

36:19.661 --> 36:22.767
Fuck off, Joaquin.

36:22.768 --> 36:25.006
Hey.

36:26.442 --> 36:28.178
Hey, you guys here to get the swab kit?

36:28.179 --> 36:29.882
- That's right.
- For both of you?

36:29.883 --> 36:32.186
- Just for the kid.
- All right, just so you know,

36:32.187 --> 36:34.257
we got a special promo going
on today if you're interested.

36:34.258 --> 36:36.094
Get two DNA tests at half off,

36:36.095 --> 36:37.864
so, basically, you get one free.

36:37.865 --> 36:40.302
Just for the kid, thanks.

36:40.303 --> 36:43.608
What are my chances of
being from the Motherland?

36:43.609 --> 36:46.147
As in Africa or as in...

36:46.148 --> 36:48.218
Africa.

36:48.219 --> 36:49.855
It's pretty fair, actually.

36:49.856 --> 36:51.892
You know, I had the test done,
and it changed my life.

36:51.893 --> 36:54.865
Found out my family was from
the Fulani tribe of Nigeria.

36:54.866 --> 36:56.067
Been there twice now.

36:56.068 --> 36:57.603
Planning on moving there next year.

36:57.604 --> 37:00.209
Even changed my name to Chuku.

37:00.210 --> 37:02.112
What was your name before?

37:02.113 --> 37:04.584
My slave name was Lin.

37:04.585 --> 37:07.089
Hey, what if we're in
the same tribe, Mr. W?

37:07.090 --> 37:09.560
- Wouldn't that be cool?
- I don't think so, Gallagher.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.366
- How do you know we aren't?
- You could find out.

37:12.367 --> 37:14.270
We'll let you know when
we get the results.

37:14.271 --> 37:17.277
Our two-for-one special's
kind of unbeatable.

37:19.615 --> 37:21.384
If I find out

37:21.385 --> 37:24.624
any of your people owned
any of my people,

37:24.625 --> 37:27.631
I'm gonna have to shoot you.

37:49.942 --> 37:51.711
- Whoa!
- Ow, ooh, oh!

37:51.712 --> 37:53.548
I'm sorry.

37:53.549 --> 37:54.618
Need a ride?

37:58.994 --> 38:01.731
Ah.

38:01.732 --> 38:04.603
Frank, aren't you
supposed to be buried

38:04.604 --> 38:06.140
under some bulldozers?

38:06.141 --> 38:08.745
Take more than that to
kill this cockroach.

38:08.746 --> 38:11.985
Barmaids, whatever you have
on tap for the wife and me.

38:11.986 --> 38:14.091
- We gettin' married?
- No.

38:16.830 --> 38:20.001
It's a figure of speech.

38:20.002 --> 38:22.974
No more running bar tab for sewer rat

38:22.975 --> 38:24.176
who never pays.

38:24.177 --> 38:25.712
I assume

38:25.713 --> 38:27.282
you're referring to Kermit,

38:27.283 --> 38:30.155
but I'm ready to reconcile my debt.

38:30.156 --> 38:31.724
Give me the numbers.

38:31.725 --> 38:34.163
Two hundred twenty-three dollars
and seventy-five cents.

38:34.164 --> 38:36.534
How about just for the last 30 days?

38:36.535 --> 38:41.310
Two hundred twenty-three dollars
and seventy-five cents.

38:41.311 --> 38:42.847
It's gonna take real money, Frank.

38:42.848 --> 38:44.049
Kev's not here for you to confuse.

38:44.050 --> 38:45.185
Mm-hmm.

38:45.186 --> 38:47.089
What other kind of money is there?

38:47.090 --> 38:48.859
What, did you rob a bum there, Frank?

38:48.860 --> 38:50.930
Or a lousy stripper?

38:50.931 --> 38:54.203
Old-fashioned
entrepreneurship, my friends.

38:54.204 --> 38:56.875
I create financial opportunities

38:56.876 --> 38:58.144
for the homeless,

38:58.145 --> 39:00.015
I get to keep a nest egg for myself...

39:00.016 --> 39:01.350
The American way.

39:01.351 --> 39:03.321
Hey, careful spending
all that in one place.

39:03.322 --> 39:04.791
How you gonna afford your drugs?

39:04.792 --> 39:06.160
That's a good point.

39:06.161 --> 39:08.398
It may be time to increase my profits.

39:08.399 --> 39:10.702
Two hundred twenty-three dollars...

39:10.703 --> 39:12.907
And 75 cents.

39:14.678 --> 39:17.649
Mm.

39:17.650 --> 39:19.855
Oh, my God, I'm crazy...

39:24.064 --> 39:26.534
Properly boozed and debt-free...

39:26.535 --> 39:28.004
What a way to live.

39:31.245 --> 39:32.847
Uh, one second, please.

39:32.848 --> 39:34.250
Neil?

39:34.251 --> 39:35.685
I took the bus.

39:35.686 --> 39:38.959
I met a redheaded girl with big tatas.

39:38.960 --> 39:41.197
Uh, you two know each other?

39:41.198 --> 39:43.101
This is my brother. Excuse him.

39:43.102 --> 39:44.737
He was in an accident and
says whatever he's thinking.

39:44.738 --> 39:47.944
Hey, Neil, no tatas.

39:47.945 --> 39:49.647
Oh, sorry.

39:49.648 --> 39:50.983
He seems sweet,

39:50.984 --> 39:52.386
and Franny seems to really like him.

39:52.387 --> 39:53.789
I'm hungry.

39:53.790 --> 39:55.492
I have to work, but I'll
bring you a burger,

39:55.493 --> 39:57.262
- all right?
- Okay.

39:57.263 --> 40:00.068
- I could sit with him.
- You sure you don't mind?

40:00.069 --> 40:01.637
Totally sure.

40:01.638 --> 40:04.410
Okay, uh, if he tries to
touch your tits or anything,

40:04.411 --> 40:06.247
just swat his hands
away. It's involuntary.

40:06.248 --> 40:07.583
Okay.

40:07.584 --> 40:08.853
I'll bring you guys some Cokes.

40:12.660 --> 40:15.432
Who is that weird, creepy
guy sitting with my sister?

40:15.433 --> 40:16.935
Uh, my brain-damaged brother.

40:16.936 --> 40:18.939
Debbie sitting with him cool?

40:18.940 --> 40:21.143
- Yeah, of course.
- All right.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.562
- Hey.
- Hey. Peppermint tea.

40:30.563 --> 40:33.234
Sober tonic before headin' into work.

40:33.235 --> 40:35.338
Good idea. Thanks.

40:35.339 --> 40:37.343
Come on.

40:43.355 --> 40:45.659
I, um... I had a blast
hangin' last night.

40:45.660 --> 40:48.097
Yeah, the party was epic.

40:48.098 --> 40:50.001
Might need to go light
a few days to recover.

40:50.002 --> 40:52.639
Oh, we can always hang out
at my place next time.

40:52.640 --> 40:54.376
Watch a movie or fuck.

40:54.377 --> 40:55.780
What?

40:55.781 --> 40:57.115
Well, dude, come on.

40:57.116 --> 40:58.819
You were all over me last night.

40:58.820 --> 41:01.557
- We were drunk.
- Call it whatever you want,

41:01.558 --> 41:03.695
but, uh, you couldn't keep
your tongue off of me.

41:03.696 --> 41:04.898
You were in heat,

41:04.899 --> 41:08.204
ready to hump anything that moves.

41:08.205 --> 41:10.375
I, uh... I get it if
you're too scared to admit

41:10.376 --> 41:12.212
that you've got the
hots for a trans dude.

41:12.213 --> 41:15.251
I'm not scared of anything.

41:15.252 --> 41:16.922
I-I'm into cock.

41:16.923 --> 41:20.362
What, afraid you'll
get your world rocked, Red?

41:22.700 --> 41:24.336
You do have a vagina, right?

41:24.337 --> 41:27.509
Like, technically, not philosophically?

41:27.510 --> 41:30.281
I have a cock for packing.

41:30.282 --> 41:33.554
I have a... several
silicone cocks for fucking.

41:33.555 --> 41:35.926
I consider to have a cock
connected to my body.

41:35.927 --> 41:39.133
The "vagina" is a nonfactor.

41:39.134 --> 41:40.702
It's cool, okay?

41:40.703 --> 41:42.940
There's no need to be freaked out.

41:42.941 --> 41:44.911
We can just be friends...

41:44.912 --> 41:46.614
really hot friends

41:46.615 --> 41:49.386
who both have cocks.

41:49.387 --> 41:51.090
Give me a shout when you're
free to hang, all right?

41:51.091 --> 41:52.828
Yeah, yeah.

41:57.905 --> 42:00.275
See you later, friend.

42:07.089 --> 42:08.892
So workforce or college...

42:08.893 --> 42:11.197
Which one's the bigger scam?

42:11.198 --> 42:13.568
Uh...

42:13.569 --> 42:16.273
I don't know. Maybe equal, I guess.

42:16.274 --> 42:18.377
Look at all this fresh meat.

42:18.378 --> 42:20.315
College has got to have
an edge on that, right?

42:20.316 --> 42:22.920
Yeah, higher concentration maybe.

42:22.921 --> 42:24.656
I don't know about an edge.

42:24.657 --> 42:26.896
You not planning to come back?

42:29.567 --> 42:31.570
Nah, I'm, um...

42:31.571 --> 42:34.176
interning for a bunch of
rich college friends.

42:34.177 --> 42:37.984
Degrees bought and paid for
by trust funds or whatever.

42:37.985 --> 42:40.655
I tutor douche bags like
that in Micro Engineering,

42:40.656 --> 42:43.795
and they'll still end up with the jobs.

42:43.796 --> 42:45.698
It sucks ass, but...

42:45.699 --> 42:48.104
We could hack these fucks, and
they wouldn't know what hit 'em.

42:54.752 --> 42:56.788
Wait, w-what?

42:56.789 --> 42:58.391
Look, I'm already into their system

42:58.392 --> 43:00.561
helping them reboot the company, right?

43:00.562 --> 43:02.967
Easy access to reroute
credit card payments

43:02.968 --> 43:04.503
to our own account.

43:04.504 --> 43:06.307
This is what you came up here for?

43:06.308 --> 43:08.812
You're the smartest lowlife I know.

43:10.416 --> 43:11.751
So you had an accident?

43:11.752 --> 43:13.789
I rode my skateboard into a bus.

43:13.790 --> 43:15.525
What does your hair smell like?

43:15.526 --> 43:17.629
Uh, shampoo, I think.

43:17.630 --> 43:19.299
- Were you wearin' a helmet?
- No.

43:19.300 --> 43:22.138
Like strawberry shampoo
or dandruff shampoo?

43:22.139 --> 43:24.209
Closer to strawberry, I think.

43:24.210 --> 43:25.478
Did you sue the bus company?

43:25.479 --> 43:28.017
Yeah, won a lot of money and disability.

43:28.018 --> 43:31.023
And I like babies. And I
like your juicy booty.

43:31.024 --> 43:33.694
Involuntary, right?

43:33.695 --> 43:35.331
Uh, do you have your own place?

43:35.332 --> 43:36.734
Yeah, with my sister.

43:36.735 --> 43:39.706
- Is it soft?
- My booty?

43:39.707 --> 43:42.045
Uh, sort of, I guess.

43:42.046 --> 43:45.485
Your nipples are hard
through your shirt.

43:45.486 --> 43:48.324
Uh, who takes care of you?

43:48.325 --> 43:50.829
Sierra, when she's not busy,
but she's busy a lot.

43:50.830 --> 43:53.467
Hmm.

43:53.468 --> 43:55.705
So let me get this straight.

43:55.706 --> 43:57.375
You have your own place,

43:57.376 --> 44:00.615
your own money, and nobody
to take care of you?

44:00.616 --> 44:03.454
Neil, do you believe in fate?

44:06.461 --> 44:09.066
<i>* There's nobody's gonna take my *</i>

44:10.302 --> 44:12.172
<i>* Name *</i>

44:12.173 --> 44:15.879
<i>* And nobody's gonna
take me to yesterday *</i>

44:17.583 --> 44:22.325
<i>* And nobody's gonna take my name *</i>

44:22.326 --> 44:27.068
<i>* No, and nobody's gonna
take me to yesterday *</i>

44:27.069 --> 44:28.204
<i>* No *</i>

44:28.205 --> 44:30.074
- Hey.
- What's up?

44:30.075 --> 44:32.545
Mind if I use the washer?
It's some of Liam's stuff.

44:32.546 --> 44:34.382
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
Just keep your mouth shut.

44:34.383 --> 44:35.853
The babies are still sleepin'.

44:35.854 --> 44:37.857
Oh, man, they got their shots today.

44:37.858 --> 44:39.259
Well, some did.

44:39.260 --> 44:40.695
We're waitin' to see on who gets sick.

44:40.696 --> 44:43.902
These viruses... Deadly stuff, man.

44:43.903 --> 44:46.473
Oh, uh, Fiona left some,
uh, shit for you.

44:46.474 --> 44:49.746
It's V's, I guess.

44:49.747 --> 44:52.585
What, hooker boots and CDs?

44:52.586 --> 44:54.824
Did Fiona tell you what's
goin' on with those two?

44:54.825 --> 44:56.493
I-I think I must've missed somethin'.

44:56.494 --> 44:58.197
Uh, not really. She's just being weird

44:58.198 --> 45:00.034
- about the whole thing.
- Must be what it's like

45:00.035 --> 45:01.670
for kids whose folks are
going through a divorce.

45:01.671 --> 45:03.040
One minute they're BFFs,

45:03.041 --> 45:04.844
the next minute you're picking on

45:04.845 --> 45:06.547
who you want to live with.
It's stressin' me out.

45:06.548 --> 45:08.250
I mean, I'm pickin' V, obviously,

45:08.251 --> 45:09.754
but it doesn't mean I don't miss Fiona.

45:09.755 --> 45:11.958
Ah, they're both being stupid.

45:11.959 --> 45:14.462
What's goin' on with you?

45:14.463 --> 45:15.933
Same old, same old.

45:15.934 --> 45:17.569
Ah, dude, don't hold out on me.

45:17.570 --> 45:20.575
I've been dealing with toddlers
all day, talking ABCs,

45:20.576 --> 45:23.080
telling 'em what sounds a cow makes.

45:23.081 --> 45:25.586
It's moo, motherfucker. It's moo.

45:29.060 --> 45:30.728
I'm thinkin' about fuckin'
one of my friends.

45:30.729 --> 45:33.133
Sweet. Why... why even think about it?

45:33.134 --> 45:36.006
- Just do it.
- He's got a vagina, kind of.

45:36.007 --> 45:38.310
What, like a real vagina,
or he acts like a pussy?

45:38.311 --> 45:39.746
No, no, like a real, live vagina,

45:39.747 --> 45:41.483
except I'm not supposed to call it that

45:41.484 --> 45:45.191
because the vagina's, like,
a fuckin' nonfactor.

45:45.192 --> 45:47.161
- I don't know.
- So is it imaginary?

45:47.162 --> 45:49.432
No, I think it's more like a man cave.

45:49.433 --> 45:51.737
I don't even know if we're still
talking about body parts.

45:51.738 --> 45:53.374
Uh, you know...

45:53.375 --> 45:56.079
I re... I really like the guy,

45:56.080 --> 45:57.482
and, uh, he's... he's hot.

45:57.483 --> 45:59.319
I don't want to mess up
the friendship part,

45:59.320 --> 46:01.623
and I-I don't know if I
can suck silicone cock.

46:01.624 --> 46:03.494
Right.

46:03.495 --> 46:04.663
Right. I'm still confused.

46:04.664 --> 46:06.934
Is guy vag different from girl vag?

46:09.106 --> 46:11.811
Uh, don't worry about it. I'll
be back for Liam's clothes.

46:11.812 --> 46:14.182
Yo, thanks for the adult convo, Kev.

46:14.183 --> 46:16.019
Glad I could help, man.

46:21.331 --> 46:22.766
Hey, Etta,

46:22.767 --> 46:24.269
those suit guys hassling you again?

46:24.270 --> 46:25.671
Whose suits?

46:25.672 --> 46:27.475
From the North Side, the realtors?

46:27.476 --> 46:29.479
Oh.

46:29.480 --> 46:32.786
They offered me 100 grand for the lease,

46:32.787 --> 46:36.560
but they said I couldn't live
upstairs with my cats no more.

46:36.561 --> 46:38.464
They're tryin' to kick you
out of your apartment?

46:38.465 --> 46:42.004
I've lived in this place since the '50s,

46:42.005 --> 46:44.376
and now they're tryin'
to buy out my lease

46:44.377 --> 46:46.513
and take my apartment, too.

46:46.514 --> 46:48.417
You don't have to get
run out by these guys.

46:48.418 --> 46:50.154
I bet if you offered a few perks,

46:50.155 --> 46:51.958
offered free delivery, maybe.

46:51.959 --> 46:55.264
You'd get a ton more people up in here.

46:55.265 --> 46:56.533
Hell, I've been doin'
other people's wash

46:56.534 --> 46:58.203
since I was in diapers.

46:58.204 --> 46:59.807
We could split the profits.

46:59.808 --> 47:01.543
You wouldn't even have
to worry about it.

47:01.544 --> 47:05.117
What's the use, honey?

47:05.118 --> 47:07.523
Rich people always win.

47:15.405 --> 47:18.210
Seventy-four, 75 bucks!

47:18.211 --> 47:20.481
Not bad, New Lip.

47:20.482 --> 47:22.151
Not bad at all.

47:22.152 --> 47:25.591
I'm gonna take, uh, 50%
for the savings fund.

47:25.592 --> 47:28.497
I thought it was 25%?

47:28.498 --> 47:30.869
I'm contributing to home improvement.

47:30.870 --> 47:33.707
Electric bills for flat
screens and washers

47:33.708 --> 47:36.447
don't pay themselves.

47:38.084 --> 47:41.289
What do you say, troops?
Keep it or send it back?

47:41.290 --> 47:44.128
Keep it, keep it, keep it.

47:44.129 --> 47:47.401
Don't forget who's lookin'
after your financial future.

47:47.402 --> 47:49.974
Daddy Frank, Daddy Frank,

47:49.975 --> 47:52.913
Daddy Frank, Daddy Frank,

47:52.914 --> 47:57.088
Daddy Frank, Daddy Frank, Daddy Frank.

47:57.089 --> 48:00.762
Hey, hey, hey, we can't hear the TV.

48:02.432 --> 48:03.700
Excuse me.

48:03.701 --> 48:04.904
Tight-ass lady at table two

48:04.905 --> 48:07.209
said she owns the place, asked for you.

48:11.350 --> 48:13.720
Mushroom turkey burger
with sweet-potato fries

48:13.721 --> 48:15.691
is our most popular.

48:15.692 --> 48:19.599
Chad said you stopped by
today askin' for a raise.

48:19.600 --> 48:22.071
We're doin' great. I think I earned it.

48:22.072 --> 48:25.277
- How are your prime costs?
- Food cost is at 35%.

48:25.278 --> 48:27.381
Lots of new items on this menu.

48:27.382 --> 48:29.652
I removed 20 old items
that weren't sellin',

48:29.653 --> 48:31.489
and I saved two percent on meat costs

48:31.490 --> 48:32.759
by gettin' rid of the
triple beef burger.

48:32.760 --> 48:34.930
- Labor costs?
- Down to 28%.

48:34.931 --> 48:37.435
I deserve that raise.

48:37.436 --> 48:40.642
I authorized Chad to give
you 25 extra bucks a week.

48:41.778 --> 48:43.480
I asked for 50.

48:43.481 --> 48:45.986
- We're negotiating now?
- Yeah, we are.

48:45.987 --> 48:48.256
You got a city block for sale somewhere

48:48.257 --> 48:50.361
or a rundown apartment building

48:50.362 --> 48:52.031
in some up-and-coming neighborhood?

48:52.032 --> 48:54.803
'Cause those are the only
people that I negotiate with.

48:54.804 --> 48:56.874
I'm throwin' you a bone. Take it.

48:56.875 --> 49:00.547
And I will take that
mushroom turkey burger.

49:13.074 --> 49:16.246
Okay, adoption application
is ready for signature.

49:16.247 --> 49:18.116
So I got to admit...

49:18.117 --> 49:20.855
As much as I was worried about
this whole adoption thing,

49:20.856 --> 49:23.694
I kind of like bein' Big Papa.

49:23.695 --> 49:26.934
On count of three, we
take shots, and we sign.

49:26.935 --> 49:28.670
<i>Speaking Russian</i>

49:28.671 --> 49:30.674
To thrupple kids.

49:49.146 --> 49:50.314
- Yo?
- <i>What's up?</i>

49:50.315 --> 49:51.516
We in the system?

49:51.517 --> 49:54.088
Uh...

49:54.089 --> 49:57.728
All right, hide a transfer
beta where they won't see it.

49:57.729 --> 49:58.730
Now.

50:10.688 --> 50:12.091
Screw you, Rocky.

50:12.092 --> 50:15.030
Mr. Gallagher, we didn't find

50:15.031 --> 50:17.034
any African lineage in your strand.

50:17.035 --> 50:19.071
Wait, rea... Are you sure?

50:19.072 --> 50:22.211
Ah, but we did find 33.5%
Native American ancestry

50:22.212 --> 50:25.952
traceable to the Apache tribe.

50:25.953 --> 50:27.588
- You mean I'm an Indian?
- Mmm.

50:27.589 --> 50:29.258
And, uh, Mr. Winslow,

50:29.259 --> 50:33.099
your DNA test reveals 22% Irish
traceable to the Puritans.

50:33.100 --> 50:36.673
What? As in Pilgrims?

50:36.674 --> 50:37.943
Mm-hmm, that's right.

50:37.944 --> 50:40.113
You two are the Pilgrims
and the Indians.

50:40.114 --> 50:42.284
Didn't your people kill my people?

50:42.285 --> 50:44.655
Don't say another word.

50:44.656 --> 50:46.192
Apache, bitch.

50:46.193 --> 50:48.430
I'm goin' to military school.

50:50.635 --> 50:53.274
Who is it?

50:56.313 --> 50:58.951
Deb Gallagher at this address?

51:03.896 --> 51:06.300
Debs, for you.

51:13.014 --> 51:14.783
- Uh, yeah?
- Debbie Gallagher?

51:14.784 --> 51:16.286
I'm Tony Casas

51:16.287 --> 51:18.623
from the Department of
Children and Family Services.

51:18.624 --> 51:21.029
We want to inform you that
we're opening an investigation

51:21.030 --> 51:23.768
to determine whether or not your
daughter, Frances Gallagher,

51:23.769 --> 51:26.506
is the victim of child
endangerment and neglect.

51:26.507 --> 51:28.711
What?

51:35.960 --> 51:38.697
This is you, correct?

51:50.421 --> 51:52.859
Babies look okay so far.

51:52.860 --> 51:55.197
I don't see any smallpox or measles.

51:55.198 --> 51:57.134
Ooh.

51:57.135 --> 51:58.536
Gemma sounds like she's gettin' a cold.

51:58.537 --> 51:59.840
Did she get vaccinated or no?

51:59.841 --> 52:02.457
Yes. Wait, no.

52:02.459 --> 52:03.346
Wait.

52:03.347 --> 52:05.050
Shit, I forgot to write it down.

52:05.051 --> 52:08.374
No, yeah. I don't know.
