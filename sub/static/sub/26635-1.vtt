<i>- Hey!
- Hey.</i>

01:18.943 --> 01:21.277
I think I'm gonna
leave Mr. Hugsy here.

01:21.312 --> 01:23.946
- Really?
- I'm eighteen.

01:23.982 --> 01:26.749
But he's so cute, and
you've had him for so long.

01:26.784 --> 01:29.252
Mom, it's not really cool
to show up to college

01:29.287 --> 01:30.119
with a stuffed animal.

01:30.155 --> 01:32.188
I did, Penelope
Josephine got me through

01:32.223 --> 01:34.157
a lot of late-night studying.

01:34.459 --> 01:37.660
So, are you hungry, can I
make you something for the road?

01:37.695 --> 01:39.762
We should grab some
food on the drive.

01:39.797 --> 01:42.899
Okay, gas station hot dogs,
are not an option.

01:43.134 --> 01:46.502
I'm serious Mom, I'm not hungry.
But thank you!

02:31.950 --> 02:35.051
- Hello?
- Hey Marcus, in here.

02:36.721 --> 02:38.921
- You're baking?
- Yeah, for the road.

02:38.957 --> 02:41.857
- I tried to reason with her.
- Well I am who I am.

02:41.893 --> 02:44.393
For the new freshman.

02:44.429 --> 02:46.162
Thank you Uncle Marcus.

02:46.197 --> 02:46.963
Well, spoiler alert...

02:46.998 --> 02:49.732
It's a gift card for the off-chance
your mother forgot something.

02:49.767 --> 02:51.033
Never.

02:52.070 --> 02:53.402
- Maddy!
- Maddy?

02:53.438 --> 02:54.403
New roommate.

02:54.439 --> 02:56.105
Hey! We're almost on the road.

02:56.140 --> 02:57.707
Make sure I have
Maddy's phone number,

02:57.742 --> 03:01.344
her parents home and cell numbers,
and everyone's emails.

03:01.379 --> 03:02.945
Did you get everything
on that list?

03:02.981 --> 03:04.814
My gosh.

03:04.916 --> 03:08.751
You... are the best.

03:08.786 --> 03:09.819
True.

03:09.854 --> 03:12.121
And your freshly watered
plants will say the same,

03:12.156 --> 03:13.889
when you get back from Oregon.

03:14.125 --> 03:16.359
This was out front.

03:16.394 --> 03:20.062
Those real estate agents have
been circling this house forever.

03:21.332 --> 03:22.465
What is that look for?

03:22.500 --> 03:26.202
Just, you know, maybe now
is a good time to consider.

03:26.237 --> 03:29.205
I'm not going to sell this house.
Joe and I bought it together.

03:29.240 --> 03:32.108
Cara... took her first steps
right over there.

03:34.912 --> 03:38.781
- All my memories are here.
- Why not make new memories?

03:38.816 --> 03:43.819
- It's been six years.
- I know, it's just...

03:43.855 --> 03:48.658
I don't know...
what to do next.

03:48.693 --> 03:54.096
It's just been me and Cara
for so long, and now it's... me.

03:54.365 --> 03:56.299
Well, why not go back to work?

03:56.334 --> 03:57.411
Well, I haven't been
an accountant

03:57.435 --> 04:01.771
for anyone outside this family
since Cara was born?

04:01.806 --> 04:02.950
I mean, what would I put
on my resume?

04:02.974 --> 04:07.109
Girl Scout leader, chaperone
to all the school dances,

04:07.145 --> 04:09.745
the head of the PTA
for the last 18 years!

04:09.781 --> 04:14.083
That would be outstanding head
of the PTA for the past 18 years.

04:14.118 --> 04:16.584
No, but seriously Marcus,
I mean, who's gonna hire me?

04:16.620 --> 04:20.956
Hey... Someone smart, someone
who wants someone smart.

04:20.992 --> 04:25.294
Detail oriented,
always gets things done.

04:25.330 --> 04:28.264
Look sis, whatever
step you do take,

04:28.299 --> 04:30.433
make sure it's the
best one for you.

04:31.035 --> 04:32.668
Yeah.

04:32.704 --> 04:34.270
And don't stop baking.

04:34.305 --> 04:37.106
- Hey those are for the road.
- Excellent idea, I'll take two.

04:37.141 --> 04:38.441
Hey!

04:43.648 --> 04:45.614
- You ready?
- Yeah.

04:45.650 --> 04:46.982
Let's go.

05:06.537 --> 05:08.971
Alright, I'm spending the night
at Cheryl and Burt's

05:09.006 --> 05:12.875
before heading out tomorrow,
so I'll still be here if you need me.

05:12.910 --> 05:16.312
Cool, it'll be nice to see
Mr. and Mrs. Morgan again.

05:16.347 --> 05:18.214
Don't forget, Cheryl
is not just my friend,

05:18.249 --> 05:20.583
she's the director
of admissions,

05:20.618 --> 05:22.918
- ... and Burt's...
- Burt's an econ' professor.

05:22.954 --> 05:25.087
Yes Mom. I know.

05:25.123 --> 05:27.757
Look, I'm just saying
you have people there,

05:27.792 --> 05:30.226
- so you won't be alone.
- I'm not going to be alone.

05:30.261 --> 05:33.496
I'll have Maddy,
and all of my new friends.

05:33.531 --> 05:37.099
And it's not like you and I won't
be talkin' everyday anyway,

05:37.135 --> 05:38.868
but thank you.

05:42.106 --> 05:43.539
What is it?

05:44.208 --> 05:46.175
I'm hungry.

05:50.415 --> 05:52.915
<i>I love your pumpkin
zucchini muffins.</i>

05:52.950 --> 05:53.916
I know.

05:53.951 --> 05:55.384
Yes!

06:13.905 --> 06:16.605
- So exciting.
- I know.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.480
Are these dorms?

06:24.515 --> 06:26.782
These, I think...
are these your dorms?

06:27.418 --> 06:29.852
I think my class is actually.

06:31.422 --> 06:32.388
What is that?

06:32.423 --> 06:34.256
We should get that lamp.

06:34.358 --> 06:35.358
Mom watch out.

06:48.673 --> 06:51.140
You can go forward now.

06:51.175 --> 06:54.276
So I downloaded your meal plan
to your calendar.

06:54.312 --> 06:57.112
And, you're signed up
for all the school alerts.

06:57.148 --> 06:58.314
Mom, seriously?

06:58.349 --> 07:02.398
Well, I mean dorm rooms are like
preschool all over again. Trust me.

07:02.433 --> 07:04.298
I'm going to be like 30
by the time the thing's empty!

07:04.322 --> 07:06.655
Wait... just...

07:08.359 --> 07:10.326
Let me help you out here.

07:13.164 --> 07:16.232
- Mr...?
- Hugsy.

07:16.334 --> 07:18.100
Hugsy.

07:18.135 --> 07:20.302
- Yours?
- My daughters.

07:20.338 --> 07:23.339
From a long time ago, and
he isn't supposed to be here.

07:23.374 --> 07:25.274
Well I thought you
might change your mind.

07:25.309 --> 07:28.244
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

07:28.279 --> 07:30.779
I think it's time
I moved on from Mr. Hugsy.

07:30.815 --> 07:33.048
Thank you.

07:36.754 --> 07:39.188
I've seen this scenario
play out a lot.

07:39.223 --> 07:40.422
Teddy bear rejection?

07:40.458 --> 07:44.527
Parents that have a tough time
hitting the release button.

07:44.562 --> 07:47.496
Why would you say that?

07:47.532 --> 07:48.364
Just a feeling.

07:48.399 --> 07:52.668
Really, I'm sorry,
and who are you?

07:52.703 --> 07:55.337
- I'm Noah.
- Noah...

07:55.373 --> 07:58.341
- Well Noah, are you a parent?
- No, I'm not.

07:58.376 --> 08:01.577
Then how could you possibly know
how difficult a day like today is?

08:01.612 --> 08:03.412
Yes and no,
I've worked here for 3 years,

08:03.447 --> 08:05.259
and this is the fifth
school that I've worked at.

08:05.283 --> 08:08.384
So I've seen it a few times.

08:08.419 --> 08:11.687
- How many schools?
- Five.

08:11.789 --> 08:15.190
It sounds like
moving on is your specialty.

08:15.226 --> 08:17.560
Touche.

08:17.595 --> 08:20.729
- Did she go...
- Yeah straight through there.

08:25.937 --> 08:27.336
And for the record...

08:27.371 --> 08:30.005
I can hit the
release button just fine.

08:30.041 --> 08:31.941
When it's time.

08:51.762 --> 08:53.796
<i>- Hi!
- Hi! New roomie!</i>

08:53.831 --> 08:54.663
Roomies oh my gosh.

08:54.699 --> 08:56.632
We're gonna have
so much fun together.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.367
Maddy this is my mother.

08:58.402 --> 08:59.646
- Nice to meet you Maddy.
- You too.

08:59.670 --> 09:01.570
- Maddy Seaton.
- Hi.

09:02.173 --> 09:05.274
Okay Girls, so, I got,

09:05.309 --> 09:09.745
matching bedding if you want
okay, there's no pressure.

09:10.815 --> 09:13.782
This way you'll have the
best room in the hallway.

09:13.818 --> 09:15.951
Mom, she has her own.

09:15.987 --> 09:20.289
- But this is cool, we can match.
- Okay, yeah.

09:21.792 --> 09:23.225
So Maddy, are you
from around here?

09:23.260 --> 09:24.660
Yes Ma'mm. Portland.

09:24.695 --> 09:27.096
And you chose to go
to school at Oregon College

09:27.131 --> 09:28.664
because you wanted
to be close to home?

09:28.699 --> 09:31.166
Actually I picked it because
my grandfather's an allum'

09:31.202 --> 09:34.303
and he wanted my dad to go, but
Dad ended up settling up abroad.

09:34.338 --> 09:36.805
So now it's up to me
to carry the torch.

09:36.841 --> 09:39.141
And I couldn't
be prouder of you.

09:39.176 --> 09:41.477
Granddad, this is
my new roommate Cara,

09:41.512 --> 09:43.512
and her mom, Mrs. Andolini.

09:43.547 --> 09:45.981
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

09:46.017 --> 09:49.151
I just stopped by
to tell my granddaughter

09:49.186 --> 09:51.520
that I am heading home now.

09:51.555 --> 09:54.957
- Well walk me to the car.
- Sure.

09:54.992 --> 09:56.992
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

09:57.028 --> 09:59.662
Do you wanna come with?
We can explore the campus.

09:59.697 --> 10:00.963
Yeah, sure!

10:00.967 --> 10:03.365
You don't have to come
with us if you don't want to.

10:03.368 --> 10:04.240
What do you mean?

10:04.241 --> 10:05.712
Like if you want to meet
the Morgans earlier or something.

10:05.736 --> 10:10.105
- But your room's a disaster.
- No I'll organize it later, I promise.

10:10.207 --> 10:11.607
I learned from the best.

10:11.642 --> 10:12.953
Well, I'll say goodbye
before I leave tomorrow.

10:12.977 --> 10:15.177
- I love you!
- I love you!

10:15.212 --> 10:20.215
- Okay.
- Okay.

10:25.656 --> 10:29.058
I guess it's just
you and me Mr. Hugsy.

10:39.370 --> 10:42.037
You driving, or is Mr. Hugsy?

10:42.406 --> 10:43.439
I mean I'm just asking

10:43.474 --> 10:45.808
so I know how much
of a head start I'm gonna need.

10:45.843 --> 10:47.643
Well you better start now.

11:03.360 --> 11:06.061
And... lift.

11:06.397 --> 11:08.664
- I got an idea.
- Yeah, what's that?

11:08.699 --> 11:11.633
Yeah, you should come for
dinner tonight my friend.

11:12.269 --> 11:15.237
Cheryl's from from her sorority
days is in town from L.A..

11:15.272 --> 11:19.108
Raincheque.
I'm washing my hair tonight.

11:19.143 --> 11:21.076
You just said that didn't you.

11:21.112 --> 11:22.303
That reference is about
50 years out of date,

11:22.304 --> 11:23.623
but I'm gonna let it slide
because I'm a good guy.

11:23.647 --> 11:25.681
Well thank you
for your benevolence.

11:25.716 --> 11:28.250
Look Grandma, wash your
hair another night alright.

11:28.285 --> 11:30.185
Amy's fantastic, she's single,

11:30.221 --> 11:32.087
she just dropped off
her daughter at school.

11:32.123 --> 11:33.055
Well then definitely not.

11:33.090 --> 11:35.124
I deal with parents
way too much as it is.

11:35.159 --> 11:37.459
Buddy you gotta date,
you have to date.

11:37.495 --> 11:38.460
I do date.

11:38.496 --> 11:40.129
Yeah you do,
but you don't date anyone

11:40.164 --> 11:42.131
you could actually
fall in love with.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.533
- Not yet.
- Not yet, yeah.

11:44.568 --> 11:46.935
For a guy who loves
to plant so much,

11:47.271 --> 11:49.037
you sure don't like
to put down roots.

11:49.073 --> 11:52.441
I dunno, that my friend
is why you are a tumbleweed...

11:52.476 --> 11:54.576
Tumbleweed, I know.

11:54.612 --> 11:56.311
There we go.

11:56.347 --> 11:59.882
Alright Tumbleweed, let's row.

12:10.828 --> 12:12.494
The way she bolted out
of the house,

12:12.530 --> 12:15.497
you'd think she was on a track
scholarship and not science.

12:15.533 --> 12:17.399
You were the same way
in college.

12:17.434 --> 12:19.468
- I was not!
- Yes you were!

12:19.503 --> 12:21.637
Remember I was the one
you were going off with.

12:21.672 --> 12:24.473
Okay, fine, but I spent
plenty of time with my parents.

12:24.508 --> 12:25.674
It'll never be enough.

12:25.709 --> 12:29.778
I mean Connor is five, and I'm dreading
the day he goes off to college.

12:29.814 --> 12:31.158
You're the
director of administration,

12:31.182 --> 12:32.881
like he's going anywhere else.

12:32.917 --> 12:36.118
And just to make sure, I've completely
decorated his room in navy and orange.

12:36.153 --> 12:38.921
Well, I tried pushing
L.A. area schools on Cara,

12:38.956 --> 12:42.090
but one of my best friends
decided to woo her North.

12:42.126 --> 12:44.126
Well, sorry.
We're lucky to have her.

12:44.161 --> 12:46.628
Anyway, I could
woo her mother too.

12:46.664 --> 12:47.563
I have my degree.

12:47.598 --> 12:49.965
Not as a student,
to help me with events.

12:50.000 --> 12:51.611
You were always so good
at it back in college.

12:51.635 --> 12:52.434
Don't you already have someone?

12:52.469 --> 12:54.837
We do, and she's due
in two weeks.

12:54.872 --> 12:56.672
Exactly.
I had temp lined up,

12:56.707 --> 12:59.107
but he decides to take a
permanent position at tech.

12:59.143 --> 13:02.311
- So it's all on you.
- These shoulders, right here.

13:03.647 --> 13:05.647
I mean Burt's been a dear,
but it's like my life...

13:08.552 --> 13:11.520
Slow down!
Hold on.

13:14.658 --> 13:16.491
<i>Now that Jeff's got
everything in place,</i>

13:16.527 --> 13:19.962
<i>Success hangs on whether or not
he can get the generator started.</i>

13:19.997 --> 13:23.031
<i>There I go.</i>

13:23.067 --> 13:25.534
<i>One species,
the Siberian Chipmunk...</i>

13:28.038 --> 13:30.839
<i>The tumbleweed dispersal
strategies are unusual among...</i>

13:30.875 --> 13:31.740
Seriously?

13:31.775 --> 13:36.144
<i>Most species disperse their seeds,
by other mechanisms.</i>

13:38.849 --> 13:40.850
My darling, dinner was...

13:40.885 --> 13:42.818
Fantastico!

13:45.356 --> 13:46.833
Hey, what's with the phone
at the table.

13:46.857 --> 13:50.359
I'm sorry hun, but somebody's gotta
take point on this Harvest Fest,

13:50.394 --> 13:53.795
and since I can't get lady here
to bite, it's all me.

13:53.831 --> 13:56.031
What is the deal with
this Harvest Fest anyway.

13:56.066 --> 13:59.201
Well that is my cue to get you
into the bathtub Young Man.

13:59.236 --> 14:02.004
- No!
- Yes! You're going!

14:02.039 --> 14:04.239
Say goodnight.
Say goodnight.

14:04.275 --> 14:06.208
Goodnight.

14:06.243 --> 14:09.511
Careful.
Goodnight sweetie.

14:09.546 --> 14:13.248
Well the Harvest Festival is
your basic small-town festival.

14:13.284 --> 14:15.250
And it's supposed
to be a fundraiser

14:15.286 --> 14:17.586
- for the agriculture department.
- Is it?

14:17.621 --> 14:19.788
No, it's been in the red
for the last few years.

14:19.823 --> 14:22.291
So the new school president,
issued an ultimatum...

14:22.326 --> 14:25.427
If it doesn't make money this year,
it's not coming back next year.

14:25.462 --> 14:27.796
- And why is it failing?
- It's boring.

14:27.831 --> 14:30.699
- No, That's the worst.
- Stop it.

14:30.734 --> 14:32.367
Our special events
director likes to

14:32.403 --> 14:34.069
focus a little
bit more on sports,

14:34.104 --> 14:36.104
so she seated most
of the responsibility

14:36.140 --> 14:37.306
for the Harvest Festival

14:37.341 --> 14:40.242
to professor Farris, he runs
our environmental sciences.

14:40.277 --> 14:42.978
He's an amazing teacher,
he's excellent with his students,

14:43.013 --> 14:45.914
but let's just say he puts
a little more emphasis

14:45.950 --> 14:49.084
on the harvest,
and not the festival.

14:49.119 --> 14:51.320
So it's basically
a farmers market.

14:51.355 --> 14:53.488
Yes!

14:53.524 --> 14:58.627
You know I was only mostly joking
earlier, it's not such a crazy idea.

14:59.096 --> 15:02.564
- Cheryl...
- For real, just listen to me okay?

15:02.599 --> 15:03.498
I remember how good you were

15:03.534 --> 15:06.601
at organizing our
parties back in college.

15:06.637 --> 15:08.603
You made things fun
and profitable,

15:08.639 --> 15:11.673
and you've run all the events
in Cara's school since kindergarten.

15:11.709 --> 15:15.110
You my friend are a natural,
and I need a natural.

15:15.145 --> 15:19.581
- I can't just leave Los Angeles.
- Why not? Cara's here.

15:19.616 --> 15:22.651
Why, did you have a job lined up,
are you going back to accounting?

15:22.686 --> 15:25.854
No, actually, I don't know
what I'm gonna do next.

15:25.889 --> 15:29.791
I've just...
I've been a mom for so long.

15:29.827 --> 15:32.561
Well this is perfect then.
Okay.

15:32.596 --> 15:34.329
The Harvest Festival
is six weeks away,

15:34.365 --> 15:36.365
you take this time to
figure out your next step.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.867
- Six weeks?
- That's all I need, okay.

15:38.902 --> 15:42.004
And then I can find someone to take
over for Josey's maternity leave.

15:42.039 --> 15:43.350
Yeah, but I don't even
live in Oregon.

15:43.374 --> 15:45.107
I deal in temporary
housing all the time,

15:45.142 --> 15:46.508
I know the perfect place.

15:46.543 --> 15:48.543
And what about her independence?

15:48.579 --> 15:50.512
I will keep you too busy,
she will have it.

15:50.547 --> 15:53.348
I forgot what a good
negotiator you are.

15:53.384 --> 15:57.019
- Six weeks?
- Six weeks!

15:57.054 --> 15:58.286
Is that a yes?

15:58.322 --> 16:01.523
It's a strong maybe, but I have
to make sure it's okay with Cara.

16:01.558 --> 16:03.025
Understood.

16:03.060 --> 16:05.460
And I wanna meet
this Professor Ferris.

16:05.496 --> 16:07.996
Done, he's usually
on the campus farm.

16:22.579 --> 16:24.312
Excuse me?

16:24.348 --> 16:28.216
Excuse me. Have you seen
Professor Farris.

16:32.056 --> 16:33.488
At your service.

16:41.465 --> 16:46.334
If you're looking for
Mr. Hugsy, he's not here.

16:46.370 --> 16:50.338
- You're a professor?
- I am.

16:50.607 --> 16:52.908
You look like a farmer.

16:54.111 --> 16:57.846
- And what brings you by?
- Did Sheryl Morgan talk to you?

16:57.881 --> 17:00.115
I'm assuming it's not help me
plant the broccoli,

17:00.150 --> 17:03.819
which I gotta get goin' on
before the events planner get...

17:06.824 --> 17:09.925
- You.
- Me.

17:11.395 --> 17:13.428
I thought you were a mom.

17:13.464 --> 17:17.332
Moms can do two things at once.
It's actually our superpower.

17:18.935 --> 17:22.570
And you're Sheryl's friend.
How 'bout that.

17:22.839 --> 17:24.917
And you're here to talk to me
about the Harvest Festival.

17:24.942 --> 17:28.310
And see if we can work together.

17:28.345 --> 17:31.613
Well, I'm just gonna do the same thing
I've been doing the last three years so...

17:32.249 --> 17:35.951
- Well, that might be a problem.
- How so?

17:35.986 --> 17:40.622
Well are you aware that the Harvest
Festival needs to make money this year?

17:40.657 --> 17:43.058
How far off are we?

17:45.662 --> 17:47.662
That's a lot worse
than I thought.

17:47.698 --> 17:50.190
- You didn't know?
- No, no.

17:50.225 --> 17:52.434
I mean the budget details,
that was never my department.

17:52.469 --> 17:54.936
My job, was to make sure
the campus farm

17:54.972 --> 17:57.506
was highlighted in the community,
and in doing so,

17:57.541 --> 18:00.742
the farming community would
be highlighted at the festival.

18:00.777 --> 18:02.177
Right, and my job if I take it

18:02.212 --> 18:04.946
is to make sure I get the people
there, and increase the revenue.

18:04.982 --> 18:09.417
And though I'm sure that the
tomato crops are riveting...

18:09.453 --> 18:12.420
We need to up our game in
terms fun and activities.

18:12.456 --> 18:14.523
Emphasis on festival.

18:14.558 --> 18:17.692
- It's too cold for tomatoes.
- You know what I mean.

18:17.728 --> 18:20.128
- Look, Mrs Andolini...
- Amy.

18:20.164 --> 18:24.299
Local farmers need exposure,
they don't need pumpkin games.

18:24.334 --> 18:25.934
Yeah, but pumpkin games
sell tickets.

18:25.969 --> 18:27.380
That's giving
exposure to the farmers.

18:27.404 --> 18:28.815
Yeah, but there's only
so many spots.

18:28.839 --> 18:32.040
So for every pizazzy
element that you put in,

18:32.075 --> 18:33.275
a farm gets left out.

18:33.310 --> 18:35.188
Yeah but imagine how left out
they're gonna feel next year

18:35.212 --> 18:37.179
if there is no festival.

18:37.214 --> 18:39.681
And the campus farms don't get
the attention they need

18:39.716 --> 18:41.917
for future funding.

18:42.352 --> 18:44.653
Okay, that's a fair point.

18:44.688 --> 18:45.654
Thank you.

18:45.689 --> 18:47.189
But it's not the only point.

18:47.224 --> 18:48.468
I mean if this
whole event turns into

18:48.492 --> 18:50.825
a bunch of frivolous
activities that are,

18:50.861 --> 18:53.295
vaguely associated to
anything Harvest related,

18:53.330 --> 18:55.542
then my department doesn't even
need to be involved to begin with.

18:55.566 --> 18:58.166
You know, that's
a totally fair point,

18:58.202 --> 19:00.669
and I'll keep it in mind
if I decide to take the job.

19:00.704 --> 19:03.572
And when are you deciding.

19:03.607 --> 19:05.574
After I talk to my daughter.

19:20.692 --> 19:22.091
<i>Hey sweetheart.</i>

19:22.127 --> 19:23.526
Hey Mom.

19:23.562 --> 19:25.829
Hey.

19:25.864 --> 19:27.197
Have you left yet?

19:27.232 --> 19:28.865
<i>No.</i>

19:28.900 --> 19:30.033
Good.

19:30.068 --> 19:30.900
Thought you were
gonna leave town

19:30.936 --> 19:33.269
before I got a chance
to say goodbye.

19:33.305 --> 19:34.737
Well, that's never gonna happen.

19:35.774 --> 19:39.242
Hey can I...
Can I ask you a favor?

19:39.277 --> 19:40.410
<i>Sure.</i>

19:40.445 --> 19:41.556
Whenever you go back to L.A.

19:41.580 --> 19:43.413
do you mind sending me
some jackets?

19:43.448 --> 19:46.349
- Jackets?
- Yeah, like a lot of them.

19:46.384 --> 19:49.185
It's already in the 60's here.
This weather's been a total...

19:49.888 --> 19:51.621
Surprise.

19:51.656 --> 19:54.858
- Your mom's been busy.
- Oh my gosh.

19:54.893 --> 19:58.661
Well, just while I was waiting
for you.

19:58.964 --> 20:02.599
- Is that lemon grass?
- You mom bought us a diffuser.

20:02.634 --> 20:06.135
Well just a... with a little
selection of essential oils

20:06.171 --> 20:08.271
so you girls can relax
after a hard day of studying.

20:08.306 --> 20:10.373
Mom, thank you!

20:11.476 --> 20:12.587
Wait, it's getting kinda late,

20:12.611 --> 20:14.455
you're not thinking of driving
home right now are you?

20:14.479 --> 20:18.715
Well, that's an interesting story
I wanna run by you.

20:19.918 --> 20:23.319
So you would be here...

20:23.355 --> 20:25.321
- at my school...
- For six weeks.

20:25.357 --> 20:27.423
I am fully aware
that you did not plan

20:27.459 --> 20:29.092
to bring your mother
to college with you.

20:29.127 --> 20:30.860
No...

20:30.962 --> 20:31.962
Look don't get me wrong,

20:31.997 --> 20:33.808
like, I love hanging out
with you, I really do.

20:33.832 --> 20:35.565
- It's just...
- You're eighteen.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.744
And you need your independence.

20:36.768 --> 20:37.600
Yes!

20:37.636 --> 20:38.679
You know your grandmother
used to joke

20:38.703 --> 20:40.414
that she was going to come
to college with me...

20:40.438 --> 20:42.839
And, she was joking, I think...

20:42.874 --> 20:46.409
But I knew how important it was
for me to be on my own,

20:46.444 --> 20:48.578
and I would never want
to do anything

20:48.613 --> 20:51.314
to get in the way
of that for you.

20:51.516 --> 20:54.884
- So I can explain to Cheryl...
- No wait.

20:57.389 --> 20:59.889
Do you want to take the job?

21:00.725 --> 21:03.793
- I do.
- Well then you should take it.

21:03.828 --> 21:06.095
Really? I'm...

21:06.131 --> 21:10.266
- It is just six weeks though right?
- Yes, 'til Harvest Fest is over.

21:10.302 --> 21:12.669
Yeah.
I promise.

21:12.704 --> 21:14.203
Okay.

21:51.242 --> 21:53.142
I like what
you've done with the place.

21:56.247 --> 21:58.081
Well, well, well.

21:58.116 --> 22:00.717
I almost didn't recognize you
in a sportcoat.

22:01.619 --> 22:03.686
With elbow patches
and everything.

22:03.722 --> 22:06.122
That makes me
the cool professor.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.325
So I guess your daughter
gave you permission to stay.

22:09.361 --> 22:10.293
Well, we have an understanding.

22:10.328 --> 22:12.195
I'm gonna stay until
Harvest Fest is over,

22:12.230 --> 22:13.908
and then I'm gonna go back
to Los Angeles.

22:13.932 --> 22:15.932
And do what?

22:15.967 --> 22:21.537
I mean, are you an event planner,
or are you a baker?

22:26.077 --> 22:27.543
I'm well... I was.

22:27.579 --> 22:30.847
Well, I guess I still am,
an accountant.

22:31.116 --> 22:34.117
I do a lot of school events.

22:35.253 --> 22:37.186
I mean, not professionally.

22:37.222 --> 22:39.922
- Okay.
- But I can do this one.

22:39.958 --> 22:41.691
Alright.

22:41.726 --> 22:44.060
So, the first thing to do

22:44.095 --> 22:46.763
when holding an event like this
is to determine your resources.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.232
So I read through
the last three years

22:49.267 --> 22:51.234
of the Harvest Festival files,

22:51.269 --> 22:54.370
and we have our work
cut out for us.

22:54.406 --> 22:55.371
How so?

22:55.407 --> 22:58.941
Well, one of the reasons
that the Harvest Fest

22:58.977 --> 23:02.211
has been so barebones
is that the same sponsors

23:02.247 --> 23:04.714
have always
given the same amount.

23:04.816 --> 23:06.916
- At least we're consistent.
- Yes, but we need more.

23:06.951 --> 23:10.119
We need more vendors,
we need more sponsors,

23:10.155 --> 23:12.066
or the people that are giving,
need to give more.

23:12.090 --> 23:13.256
Because we need the resources

23:13.291 --> 23:17.293
to expand the fun activities
that attract the attendees,

23:17.328 --> 23:20.063
Like...
Like pumpkin games.

23:20.098 --> 23:22.932
We do not need pumpkin games.

23:22.967 --> 23:24.567
What do you have
against pumpkin games?

23:24.602 --> 23:26.803
- They are wasteful.
- They're fun.

23:26.838 --> 23:29.939
Someone takes the time to plant
the seed, in fertile soil,

23:29.974 --> 23:32.942
they water it, they wait like
3-4 months for something to grow,

23:32.977 --> 23:36.813
only to have someone else
throw the fruits of their labor

23:36.848 --> 23:41.150
against the wall, or across
the field, or whatever. No.

23:42.954 --> 23:44.620
I see.

23:44.656 --> 23:45.988
See what?

23:48.760 --> 23:51.928
You've never actually played
Harvest Festival games, have you?

23:51.963 --> 23:53.296
Of course not,
they're ridiculous.

23:55.366 --> 23:58.501
Professor Noah Ferris,
I have a question for you.

24:00.138 --> 24:02.805
What are you doing
this Saturday afternoon?

24:07.512 --> 24:10.179
- Pumpkin. Bowling.
- It's fun!

24:10.215 --> 24:12.381
Look, there's not exactly
a dearth of these things,

24:12.417 --> 24:15.318
so you can sorta dial
down the pumpkin guilt.

24:15.353 --> 24:16.986
Okay.

24:17.021 --> 24:18.955
I'm sorry about this.

24:24.863 --> 24:28.164
Well, I think
that's a gutterball.

24:28.199 --> 24:31.234
Yeah.
Well, I mean, it's not easy. So.

24:34.172 --> 24:34.937
Alright!

24:34.973 --> 24:38.708
- Yes!
- Yeah! Good job Elliot. Yeah.

24:38.743 --> 24:40.910
Wait, did I just get
out-bowled by a toddler.

24:40.945 --> 24:43.513
- Yes, I think you did.
- Thanks.

24:43.548 --> 24:45.648
- You wanna...
- Yeah, no please.

24:52.290 --> 24:53.422
<i>What?</i>

24:53.458 --> 24:55.958
- Nice form.
- Thanks.

24:56.294 --> 24:58.361
- Really?
- Yeah.

24:58.396 --> 25:00.096
Okay.

25:00.131 --> 25:02.031
I see how it is.

25:02.066 --> 25:03.866
I got this, I got this.

25:05.570 --> 25:06.914
Trying a little different
technique here.

25:06.938 --> 25:07.938
Okay.

25:11.876 --> 25:13.075
C'mon.

25:14.746 --> 25:16.078
Yeah.

25:16.114 --> 25:17.847
Hold it where the stem is.

25:17.882 --> 25:20.082
Okay, thank you.
I appreciate that, bud.

25:27.825 --> 25:30.225
Pretty sure that kid's got a future
in professional bowling.

25:31.229 --> 25:34.197
I told you it was fun, you just
have to get the hang of it.

25:34.232 --> 25:37.400
I gotta be honest, I...
had a really good time.

25:37.435 --> 25:39.869
But see, this is the draw I'm
talking about for the festival.

25:39.904 --> 25:43.773
You make it so fun that people don't
even feel like they're at a fundraiser.

25:43.808 --> 25:45.007
It's a good trick.

25:45.043 --> 25:48.144
Oh my gosh, I worked on millions
of carnivals, and festivals,

25:48.179 --> 25:52.248
and fundraisers while
Cara was growing up.

25:52.283 --> 25:54.450
Especially after
my husband passed.

25:54.752 --> 25:59.288
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

26:00.158 --> 26:04.060
I just threw myself into
doing as much as possible.

26:04.095 --> 26:06.128
Probably a lot more
than Cara liked.

26:06.164 --> 26:09.432
I don't know, I'm sure she
appreciated having you there.

26:09.767 --> 26:12.435
So, what about you
Professor Ferris?

26:12.470 --> 26:13.970
Where did you grow up.

26:14.872 --> 26:18.774
- Believe it or not, Brooklyn.
- Brooklyn!?

26:18.810 --> 26:20.476
But you don't have an accent.

26:20.511 --> 26:22.756
When you go to Stanford,
you lose your accent pretty quickly.

26:22.780 --> 26:24.647
And how did you end up
at Stanford?

26:24.682 --> 26:27.583
- Bowling scholarship.
- Bowling.

26:27.619 --> 26:29.652
<i>Rowing scholarship.</i>

26:29.687 --> 26:33.489
I was gonna major in finance,
and then in my freshmen year,

26:33.524 --> 26:35.591
a buddy of mine took me
for a hike in Yosemite

26:35.627 --> 26:38.794
and I just... I mean I just
fell in love with nature

26:38.830 --> 26:40.763
right then and there.

26:40.798 --> 26:42.632
And yeah...

26:42.667 --> 26:45.101
No more concrete jungle for me.

26:46.304 --> 26:50.306
It's like it freed me up entirely
and just started traveling like crazy,

26:50.341 --> 26:54.143
and exploring all the things
that I missed out on growing up.

26:54.178 --> 26:56.345
And why'd you stop traveling?

26:56.381 --> 26:58.514
Well, if you ask Burt
and Cheryl, I haven't.

26:59.751 --> 27:02.618
They kinda call me Tumbleweed.

27:02.654 --> 27:05.354
Because I tend to change
schools every few years.

27:05.390 --> 27:07.957
So I take it you're
not in the tenure track.

27:07.992 --> 27:12.194
No. Not so much.
Although watching Burt stay put

27:12.230 --> 27:14.196
and seeing what he's got
with Cheryl and Connor

27:14.232 --> 27:16.666
and their life together...

27:16.701 --> 27:18.334
It's really nice.

27:18.369 --> 27:23.372
Yeah, so that means it's about time
for you to go a new school?

27:23.408 --> 27:27.243
You know what, I got a meeting
I gotta get to, so I'm sorry.

27:27.278 --> 27:29.023
You know what, I know
it's not your specialty,

27:29.047 --> 27:31.981
but do you mind going over
the sponsor list with me,

27:32.016 --> 27:33.716
it might help me with.

27:34.118 --> 27:37.086
You know, before I do
any formal outreach.

27:37.121 --> 27:39.922
Yeah, I have Wednesday
afternoon available.

27:39.957 --> 27:41.190
That's great, that's great.

27:41.225 --> 27:42.558
- Okay.
- Okay. Good.

27:42.593 --> 27:44.193
- Alright.
- See you soon.

27:44.228 --> 27:46.929
Yeah, I'll see you then in...
Amy, Harvest Festival.

27:46.964 --> 27:49.665
Pumpkin bowling rematch.
It's on.

27:49.701 --> 27:51.834
Well, you better
practice Professor.

29:11.750 --> 29:12.713
Amy!

29:12.718 --> 29:15.042
- Hey.
- Hey! What are you doing here?

29:15.043 --> 29:17.131
I thought we were meeting
tomorrow to go over everything.

29:17.155 --> 29:18.532
We are, I'm just
trying to figure out

29:18.556 --> 29:21.391
where the best place
to put the stage is.

29:22.827 --> 29:25.662
- What stage?
- For the band.

29:25.697 --> 29:26.796
What band?

29:26.831 --> 29:29.699
I have been like
scoping the area for options,

29:29.734 --> 29:31.801
of which there are
disappointingly few.

29:31.836 --> 29:34.938
And I've narrowed it
down to Molly Sheep

29:34.973 --> 29:39.142
and Mercury In Retrograde,
they're both cover bands mostly.

29:39.177 --> 29:40.677
Leaning towards
Mercury In Retrograde,

29:40.712 --> 29:43.947
thought I'm a little worried
that their name may portend disaster.

29:43.982 --> 29:47.450
What, I'm sorry...
Why do we need a band?

29:47.485 --> 29:50.787
Music... you... you know
there's gonna be music, right?

29:50.822 --> 29:52.889
Yeah, I just thought
we would be playing it

29:52.924 --> 29:54.857
over the stereo
like we usually do.

29:54.893 --> 29:57.527
Yeah, but not
if you're having dancing.

29:57.562 --> 30:01.030
Wait, you wanna
have dancing in my barn?

30:01.833 --> 30:04.701
One, I'm pretty sure
it belongs to the school,

30:04.736 --> 30:06.903
unless there's something
you're not telling me.

30:06.938 --> 30:09.906
And two, it's the
best space available.

30:09.941 --> 30:10.840
What, there is
no space available.

30:10.875 --> 30:14.477
Take a look around
it's full of equipment.

30:15.914 --> 30:18.047
We can move all the equipment.

30:20.752 --> 30:25.421
No, I mean, I got
a cedar spreader over there,

30:25.457 --> 30:27.357
I've got a tractor with a loader

30:27.392 --> 30:29.659
and a landscape rake,
and some corn, a water tank.

30:29.694 --> 30:33.162
I've got lots of stuff. I mean do you
even know what a plot forge harvester is?

30:33.198 --> 30:34.664
Is it bigger than a breadbox?

30:34.699 --> 30:36.499
Yeah, it's a little bigger
than a breadbox.

30:36.534 --> 30:39.402
- So where are we gonna put all this?
- Well, baseball season's over,

30:39.437 --> 30:42.905
so maybe we can park some of the bigger
stuff out on the field for a few days,

30:42.941 --> 30:45.608
and the rest of it we
can just put up there.

30:45.643 --> 30:47.744
Good luck getting Coach
Stuart to agree to that.

30:47.779 --> 30:49.912
Oh he will... watch.

30:50.749 --> 30:53.883
Do you really need
all of this stuff.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.853
You really don't know
anything about farming do you?

30:56.888 --> 31:00.490
Well if you mean like,
driving by on the freeway.

31:00.725 --> 31:03.426
- No, that's not what I mean.
- No, then no.

31:03.461 --> 31:05.595
So how are you gonna
throw a Harvest Festival

31:05.630 --> 31:08.664
when you actually don't know
anything about harvesting?

31:08.833 --> 31:10.011
Well I've never been
to the North Pole,

31:10.035 --> 31:13.169
and I've thrown some pretty
legendary Christmas parties.

31:13.338 --> 31:15.271
Thank you very much.

31:15.306 --> 31:16.384
Well, before you get
too confident,

31:16.408 --> 31:19.342
I think a little turnaround
would be fair play here.

31:19.377 --> 31:19.968
What do you mean?

31:19.969 --> 31:21.655
Well you wanted to show me
all the finer points

31:21.679 --> 31:24.447
of the festival part
of what we're doing...

31:24.482 --> 31:25.283
Yes.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.884
Yeah, well I think it's only fair
that I show you

31:27.919 --> 31:30.486
the harvest part
of the equation.

31:45.870 --> 31:48.137
I thought you were gonna
take me to see farming.

31:48.173 --> 31:50.440
This all part of farming.
This is the middle-part,

31:50.475 --> 31:52.608
and here's the star of the
farmers market right here.

31:52.644 --> 31:54.911
- Hi!
- Sammy's here every week aren't you.

31:54.946 --> 31:55.986
- How you doin'?
- So cute.

31:56.014 --> 31:58.948
Yeah, most of the vendors
at the farmers market,

31:58.983 --> 32:00.850
they follow the 80-20 rule,

32:00.885 --> 32:04.787
which means, 80 percent of what
they sell, is grown locally,

32:04.823 --> 32:07.523
and 20 percent is brought in
from elsewhere.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.025
And...

32:09.060 --> 32:10.638
I mean there's not gonna be
a quiz or anything.

32:10.662 --> 32:15.298
No, I'm just taking names
for possible sponsors you know.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.600
Well, I think
maybe some of these guys

32:17.635 --> 32:19.180
might be a little
too small for sponsors.

32:19.204 --> 32:20.603
Mom?

32:21.139 --> 32:22.149
- What are you...
- Hey!

32:22.173 --> 32:23.606
Hey guys.

32:23.641 --> 32:25.108
Hey Mrs. Andolini,
Professor Ferris.

32:25.143 --> 32:27.643
Hey Girls, what
are you both doing here?

32:27.679 --> 32:30.880
My Grandfather has an orchard,
and I help out sometimes.

32:30.915 --> 32:33.216
And I'm just
helping Maddy out today.

32:33.251 --> 32:36.864
Don't worry, I promise both you guys
I'm caught up with all my courses.

32:36.888 --> 32:38.833
Yeah, that's a good thing
'cause one of your professors

32:38.857 --> 32:40.297
just might have
a pop quiz coming up.

32:40.325 --> 32:42.058
- Good.
- Just so you know.

32:42.093 --> 32:44.660
- Your Grandfather is...
- Edward Seaton.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.130
- One of our sponsors.
- OK, I knew, I knew the name.

32:47.165 --> 32:51.067
I was actually gonna reach out to him
about upping his sponsorship.

32:51.102 --> 32:53.703
Well is he at the orchard
today by any chance?

32:53.738 --> 32:54.537
Every Saturday.

32:54.572 --> 32:56.506
- Okay perfect.
- This is great.

32:56.541 --> 32:58.541
Now, you get to see
some farming.

32:58.576 --> 33:00.510
- Yay.
- Good to see you guys.

33:00.545 --> 33:02.678
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

33:16.294 --> 33:17.326
Planting.

33:17.362 --> 33:19.862
It's the more important step
in the whole process.

33:19.898 --> 33:22.031
You have to make sure that
you plant in the Fall,

33:22.066 --> 33:24.600
because apples need
a period of dormancy,

33:24.636 --> 33:26.435
so they can complete
their ripening process.

33:26.471 --> 33:28.604
- I can relate.
- Yeah?

33:28.640 --> 33:31.507
Well, maybe it's time
for you to grow.

33:32.977 --> 33:36.445
- See what I did there?
- Yes I see.

33:36.481 --> 33:39.048
Okay, you plant the seeds,

33:39.083 --> 33:43.119
Just about a half inch into
the soil, about like that.

33:43.154 --> 33:45.521
I'll give you the seeds,
so you can do the honors,

33:45.557 --> 33:47.456
just sprinkle them in there.

33:47.492 --> 33:48.724
Perfect, yeah.

33:49.994 --> 33:52.361
Just like that.

33:52.397 --> 33:55.765
And now we just cover it up,
just throw some dirt on there.

33:55.800 --> 33:57.567
Loosely, we don't wanna
pack it down.

33:57.602 --> 33:59.202
And then we just...

33:59.237 --> 34:01.370
- We just wait.
- And when do we get to see something?

34:01.406 --> 34:04.106
Well, by the Spring, there'll be
a row of saplings all along here.

34:04.142 --> 34:06.576
Nice.

34:06.611 --> 34:08.222
It would be great if life
that was that easy.

34:08.246 --> 34:10.413
You plant some seeds,
you water it,

34:10.447 --> 34:12.315
and wait for it to grow.

34:12.350 --> 34:14.217
Well it's not gonna be that easy,

34:14.252 --> 34:17.620
I mean only a small fraction
of these will grow into trees.

34:17.655 --> 34:20.755
It will take years of cultivation
before they start bearing fruit.

34:20.792 --> 34:24.627
And, I realize I'm brimming
with analogy right now,

34:24.661 --> 34:26.161
but it's true.

34:26.197 --> 34:30.433
I mean, some things just
take time before they're ready.

34:30.935 --> 34:32.400
Yeah.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.340
- So you wanna see the next stage?
- Yep.

34:37.375 --> 34:38.407
Okay.

34:42.179 --> 34:45.215
So I still need to talk
to Edward about sponsorship.

34:45.250 --> 34:47.751
Yeah, we can check in
with him on the way out.

34:47.786 --> 34:50.620
I'm guessing that you've
never picked apples before.

34:50.655 --> 34:52.222
Well I have at the market,

34:52.257 --> 34:56.760
I mean, don't you just
reach up and pick... one?

34:57.262 --> 35:01.598
- Well, don't tell Edward...
- No, you're safe.

35:04.436 --> 35:06.903
You know we never
did finish that story.

35:06.938 --> 35:07.889
Which one?

35:07.890 --> 35:10.240
Whether you're nearing
your time to move on from here.

35:10.275 --> 35:16.146
- Yeah, right.
- So are you moving on?

35:16.181 --> 35:17.947
Possibly.

35:17.983 --> 35:21.417
I'm up for a position
at the University of Sydney.

35:21.453 --> 35:24.654
Australia.

35:24.689 --> 35:26.856
Yeah, I should be hearing
from them soon actually.

35:26.892 --> 35:31.795
Such a distance, and well
such a great opportunity.

35:31.830 --> 35:35.331
Yeah, I mean, I've
worked in Melbourne before.

35:35.367 --> 35:38.434
And I really like it there.

35:38.470 --> 35:42.438
- Well, good luck with that.
- Thank you.

35:43.842 --> 35:45.386
You know I think I got
the hang of this.

35:45.410 --> 35:47.811
You do! But
there's one lesson left.

35:47.846 --> 35:48.711
Really, what is it?

35:48.747 --> 35:51.147
It's actually the
most important step.

35:59.257 --> 36:02.158
That's really good.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.640
Now that we've
picked a tonne of apples,

36:05.664 --> 36:07.197
what do we do with them?

36:07.232 --> 36:08.531
We donate them.

36:08.567 --> 36:10.200
- To who?
- To a shelter.

36:10.235 --> 36:12.969
So that they can store them
and use them for the holidays.

36:13.004 --> 36:15.338
Agriculture in action.

36:15.373 --> 36:17.440
We just need a...

36:18.710 --> 36:22.979
I'll be right back.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.081
Well you got yourself
quite a haul.

36:25.116 --> 36:28.751
Noah's been giving me some
pointers about Harvest Fest.

36:28.787 --> 36:31.754
- Which by the way...
- Honey Crisp.

36:31.790 --> 36:34.424
Yes, I actually use those
when I make baked apples.

36:34.459 --> 36:38.261
- Baked apples are my favorite.
- They are?

36:38.296 --> 36:42.599
- Haven't had one in a long time.
- Why not?

36:42.634 --> 36:46.636
- My wife used to make them.
- I see...

36:46.671 --> 36:51.040
And I don't know if I'm ready
to make them myself y'know?

36:51.076 --> 36:53.276
Actually, I do.

36:53.311 --> 36:54.611
You know when I lost my husband,

36:54.646 --> 36:56.512
it felt like forever
before I was comfortable

36:56.548 --> 36:58.615
with things going back
to the way they were.

36:58.650 --> 37:02.252
And especially happy things.

37:02.287 --> 37:05.521
Like baked apples.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.990
How did you deal with it?

37:08.126 --> 37:09.759
Time.

37:09.794 --> 37:12.629
And I probably threw myself
into my daughter's life

37:12.664 --> 37:17.100
much more than I care to admit.
But it does get better.

37:17.469 --> 37:21.371
Well, sorry
for getting sentimental.

37:21.406 --> 37:22.906
Listen,
my Granddaughter said that

37:22.941 --> 37:25.141
you wanted to speak to me
about something?

37:25.176 --> 37:29.746
Well, actually,
I just wanted to tell you

37:29.781 --> 37:32.048
what a beautiful orchard
you have here.

37:32.083 --> 37:35.485
Well, thank you.

37:35.520 --> 37:40.924
- Nice seeing you.
- You too.

37:40.959 --> 37:44.060
So, how'd it go with Edward?

37:44.095 --> 37:47.230
You know, I just
don't think now's the time.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.232
Yeah.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.467
Hey, I have an idea.

37:58.843 --> 38:01.177
- Hey, see!
- That's great.

38:01.212 --> 38:03.413
It's like a solid 6.5 out of 10.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.289
Two more.

38:38.183 --> 38:40.883
There we go.

38:40.919 --> 38:43.886
Well thanks for the farm lesson.
Well, I mean orchard lesson.

38:43.922 --> 38:45.688
Same idea.

38:45.724 --> 38:46.701
Hey you know what I'll do is

38:46.702 --> 38:49.359
I'll have Maddy send photos
of the saplings when they come in.

38:49.394 --> 38:52.128
Yes please.
I'll be rooting for them.

38:52.530 --> 38:53.296
Did you see that?

38:53.331 --> 38:56.332
I saw that. I saw that.
Thank you.

38:56.368 --> 38:59.302
Okay.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.803
- Here.
- Okay great.

39:03.074 --> 39:06.476
- I had a lot of fun.
- Good, me too.

39:53.158 --> 39:54.335
So we have the barn
animals over there,

39:54.359 --> 39:56.270
there's the little piggy,
and we have the cow over there.

39:56.294 --> 39:58.728
And, I think if it's like this,

39:58.763 --> 40:00.963
then the beginning
of the hay ride,

40:00.999 --> 40:03.266
needs to be kinda over there.

40:03.301 --> 40:08.538
Okay, but I like it
by the barn and the dancing.

40:08.573 --> 40:10.907
- Really?
- Yeah. I do.

40:10.942 --> 40:12.453
I still can't believe
those pecan squares

40:12.477 --> 40:14.243
were enough to sway the coach.

40:14.279 --> 40:16.646
Well, they're really
good pecan squares.

40:16.681 --> 40:18.948
I'd be happy to find out.

40:23.988 --> 40:26.589
- For me?
- Yeah.

40:26.624 --> 40:27.857
Thank you.

40:27.892 --> 40:31.794
Alright, fine you can have your
hay ride entrance by the barn.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.270
- If I can get pecan squares.
- Good.

41:07.799 --> 41:10.166
Check it out.

41:10.201 --> 41:11.373
I'm just saying that
I think we've earned it.

41:11.374 --> 41:12.502
Okay.

41:12.537 --> 41:14.170
- Yeah? C'mon.
- Yeah.

41:14.572 --> 41:15.612
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

41:15.640 --> 41:19.008
These are Fire Cider,
that is jalapeño and lime.

41:19.043 --> 41:20.977
Mom's Kitchen, that
is honey and pear.

41:21.012 --> 41:25.481
And this one is my favorite, Fall Spice,
it has cinnamon cloves, and nutmeg.

41:25.517 --> 41:27.717
- It sounds amazing.
- Yeah.

41:27.752 --> 41:29.630
My name's Chloe, let me know
if you need anything.

41:29.654 --> 41:30.694
You know what actually,

41:30.722 --> 41:32.500
would you mind putting up
one of these flyers,

41:32.524 --> 41:34.023
we're trying to
get the word out.

41:34.492 --> 41:37.994
- Harvest Festival, at the college?
- Yeah, you haven't heard about it?

41:38.029 --> 41:41.631
Kinda new around here,
but it sounds awesome, thanks.

41:41.733 --> 41:44.233
- Enjoy your cider.
- Thank you.

41:44.269 --> 41:45.568
- You ready?
- Yes.

41:45.603 --> 41:46.969
Okay, how about this.

41:47.772 --> 41:49.038
Smells good.

41:49.073 --> 41:51.207
- You know what?
- What?

41:51.242 --> 41:52.808
We should have them do a booth.

41:52.844 --> 41:55.811
- Do you always work 24/7?!
- Yeah, when I can.

41:56.214 --> 41:57.725
Well look, right back
at you Professor.

41:57.749 --> 42:00.650
You're doing everything I am,
and two jobs.

42:01.119 --> 42:04.453
- Barely notice that anymore.
- Always on the go?

42:04.956 --> 42:08.357
Yes, I guess so, I am.

42:08.393 --> 42:12.195
Why would a man like you
who teaches agriculture in action,

42:12.230 --> 42:15.131
refuse to put roots
down himself.

42:16.100 --> 42:21.504
I don't refuse, I just I haven't
found a good reason to...

42:21.539 --> 42:23.940
...yet.

42:23.975 --> 42:25.007
Okay.

42:27.612 --> 42:30.947
You have done a fantastic job
getting the word out.

42:30.982 --> 42:32.082
Well, it isn't just me,

42:32.117 --> 42:35.418
I mean Noah's been doing a
great job of promoting it.

42:35.454 --> 42:36.886
So you two are getting along?

42:40.859 --> 42:44.094
- How well are you getting along?
- What do you mean?

42:44.129 --> 42:47.797
Well, I have eyes, and
he's not exactly hard on them,

42:47.833 --> 42:49.499
and you are blushing.

42:49.534 --> 42:51.468
Okay, spill.

42:51.503 --> 42:54.337
No, I mean there's
nothing to spill.

42:54.372 --> 42:57.807
- Those rosy cheeks say otherwise.
- I mean nothing's happened.

42:57.843 --> 43:00.610
Do you want it to?

43:00.645 --> 43:03.580
I mean, I wouldn't
find it objectionable.

43:03.615 --> 43:06.683
Which from you it's like
shouting from the rooftops.

43:06.718 --> 43:10.420
I mean hardly, it's been so long
since I've even had a little crush.

43:10.455 --> 43:11.855
Yes!

43:11.890 --> 43:16.626
Alright, scale back the parade, okay!
It's a little crush, a tiny one.

43:16.661 --> 43:18.828
And I'm not even sure
how I feel about this.

43:18.864 --> 43:21.131
Well, I'm happy.

43:21.166 --> 43:26.102
Ever since Joe, you've put all your
focus on Cara, which, I get,

43:26.138 --> 43:29.372
but part of me wants to say
'hey what about my amazing friend?'.

43:29.407 --> 43:30.573
Thank you.

43:30.609 --> 43:33.343
But you know what, I mean
nothing is going to come of it.

43:33.378 --> 43:35.556
- Why not?
- Because I live in Los Angeles,

43:35.580 --> 43:39.282
and he's getting ready to move,
like... to another planet.

43:39.317 --> 43:40.517
That's geography.

43:40.552 --> 43:43.486
Yeah, but geography's a great
hindrance to a relationship.

43:43.522 --> 43:46.322
I mean not that it's using
the word relationship...

43:46.358 --> 43:49.225
Safer subject, how
is the festival going?

43:49.261 --> 43:53.530
Well, I got Noah to agree
to pumpkin games.

43:53.565 --> 43:55.198
Yeah, that's practically a miracle.

43:55.233 --> 43:58.001
Yes, and I know he love
to have more farm booths,

43:58.036 --> 44:00.570
but I can't seem to work it out
in our budget.

44:00.605 --> 44:03.840
Would an extra $5,000 help?

44:03.875 --> 44:07.377
Last minute sponsor upgrade.
Seaton Orchards.

44:07.412 --> 44:09.879
I didn't even get a chance
to give him my sales pitch.

44:09.915 --> 44:11.681
Well, whatever you did worked.

44:11.716 --> 44:13.528
Is that going to be enough
for everything we need.

44:13.552 --> 44:17.220
Yes, including the corn maze.

44:17.255 --> 44:19.222
You got Noah to agree
to a corn maze?

44:19.257 --> 44:20.902
Well no, I haven't discussed it
with him yet,

44:20.926 --> 44:23.493
but I mean who would object
to a corn maze.

44:25.730 --> 44:29.032
- Absolutely not.
- Corn mazes are huge draws.

44:29.067 --> 44:31.367
It's one thing to move some
equipment out of the barn,

44:31.403 --> 44:33.903
it is another to do thi...
No! I'm not doing it.

44:33.939 --> 44:36.840
My students work so hard
planting all this corn,

44:36.875 --> 44:38.553
I'm gonna destroy it
for a one-day festival.

44:38.577 --> 44:39.687
You're not going
to be destroying it.

44:39.711 --> 44:41.377
You'd just be harvesting you know,

44:41.413 --> 44:44.614
small sections a little earlier
than the rest, in an intricate pattern.

44:44.649 --> 44:47.050
That is not how corn mazes work.

44:47.085 --> 44:49.919
They paths are all laid
out before the planting.

44:49.955 --> 44:53.256
Yeah, but those are the big ones,
we're just talking a few acres.

44:53.291 --> 44:54.624
You know, super simple.

44:54.659 --> 44:58.428
Making a corn maze at this stage
of the game is not 'super simple'.

44:58.463 --> 45:01.531
And can you guarantee me all
the corn will be harvestable?

45:01.566 --> 45:03.933
- Well no.
- Well then no.

45:03.969 --> 45:06.402
- But you're being stubborn.
- I'm being a professor.

45:06.438 --> 45:08.037
You're being a
shortsighted professor.

45:08.073 --> 45:09.138
I'm being shortsighted?

45:09.174 --> 45:10.106
- Yes.
- How?

45:10.141 --> 45:12.609
You're protecting a
few sections of corn,

45:12.644 --> 45:14.777
at the expense of
the overall festival.

45:14.813 --> 45:15.990
Which is happening in two weeks.

45:16.014 --> 45:18.781
And let me remind you, if
it's not successful this year,

45:18.817 --> 45:21.885
- it's not happening next year.
- I am aware of that.

45:21.920 --> 45:25.421
Believe me, I want
this festival to succeed.

45:25.457 --> 45:26.956
Look, we may lose some corn now,

45:26.992 --> 45:32.629
but mazes and games, and
music are the key to success.

45:32.664 --> 45:35.064
But what am I going to
be teaching my students?

45:35.100 --> 45:37.634
To think long term.

45:46.177 --> 45:48.511
Gimme three more of these guys.

45:48.546 --> 45:50.780
Yep.

45:50.815 --> 45:52.649
Yeah, perfect.

45:52.684 --> 45:56.319
Hey, I heard back
from Sydney by the way.

45:56.354 --> 45:58.087
Looks promising.

45:58.123 --> 46:00.823
Well I can't say
I won't miss you.

46:00.859 --> 46:02.659
But if that's
where you want to be.

46:02.694 --> 46:03.793
Is it?

46:03.828 --> 46:07.030
- Not sure actually.
- What do you mean?

46:07.065 --> 46:10.833
It's something that Amy said.

46:10.869 --> 46:12.201
Amy huh?

46:12.237 --> 46:13.714
Well it was when she
was trying to convince me

46:13.738 --> 46:16.072
to ruin part
of the cornfield, she...

46:17.342 --> 46:21.044
she kinda implied that
I don't think long term.

46:21.079 --> 46:25.815
- She totally has a point.
- What, how?!

46:25.850 --> 46:27.483
Well, when I first met you
at Stanford,

46:27.519 --> 46:29.886
you had just been bitten
by the travel bug, right?

46:29.921 --> 46:31.387
And you traveled
all over the world.

46:31.423 --> 46:35.692
But you always said that
you wanted to settle down.

46:35.727 --> 46:37.627
Eventually.

46:37.662 --> 46:39.929
Except you haven't.

46:41.099 --> 46:42.065
I want do.

46:42.100 --> 46:44.467
<i>You want to. Do you?
Do you really want to?</i>

46:44.502 --> 46:45.668
Yeah.

46:45.704 --> 46:47.804
I do, I mean...

46:47.839 --> 46:51.674
- When it's right.
- When it's right.

46:52.811 --> 46:56.412
Well, I guess I worry
it's become kind of a habit,

46:56.448 --> 46:58.848
you moving from place to place.

46:58.883 --> 47:00.695
Realistically you never
stick around long enough

47:00.719 --> 47:03.019
to figure out
if it could be right.

47:05.023 --> 47:06.889
Okay, ready for next step.

47:09.227 --> 47:12.695
Maybe.
You know if find the right...

47:12.731 --> 47:14.764
No I'm talking about
the bunk-beds Romeo.

47:14.799 --> 47:16.332
Bunk beds.

47:21.039 --> 47:22.372
Got it.

47:29.114 --> 47:31.280
Hey!

47:31.316 --> 47:33.516
You sound, terrible.

47:33.551 --> 47:36.786
Oh gosh, I gave Cara a stink
about getting sick,

47:36.821 --> 47:38.187
and then I get the cold.

47:38.223 --> 47:44.127
- Well, what are you doing for it?
- It's fine, it's just a cold.

47:44.162 --> 47:46.462
I'll get through it.
Why are you calling?

47:46.498 --> 47:51.601
To... see where you'll be
in a couple hours.

47:51.636 --> 47:54.137
I'll be on the sofa, sneezing.

47:56.674 --> 47:58.041
Why?

48:04.682 --> 48:07.950
Chicken soup.
My mother's recipe.

48:07.986 --> 48:10.153
You made me chicken soup?

48:10.188 --> 48:12.722
Vegetables straight
from the garden.

48:12.757 --> 48:17.593
Nobody's done something
this nice for me in a long time.

48:17.629 --> 48:21.097
I figured that you're always
taking care of everybody else,

48:21.132 --> 48:23.800
so it's time that somebody
takes care of you.

48:23.835 --> 48:26.836
- Okay.
- No, no, you gotta go sit.

48:26.871 --> 48:28.304
And I'll bring you a bowl.

48:28.339 --> 48:30.239
- Okay.
- Yeah, go on.

49:04.976 --> 49:06.709
Thank you.

49:17.388 --> 49:20.356
- This is amazing.
- Good.

49:20.391 --> 49:22.525
It's all the fresh ingredients.

49:24.062 --> 49:27.096
I probably look awful.

49:27.432 --> 49:29.465
Not even remotely.

49:31.102 --> 49:33.202
So the other reason
I wanted to come by...

49:33.338 --> 49:39.329
I wanted to aPologize
for being a little difficult

49:39.544 --> 49:40.877
about the corn maze.

49:40.912 --> 49:44.213
It's okay.

49:44.249 --> 49:48.684
- It was a big ask.
- Well, not an impossible one.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.821
All we gotta do
is get a little creative.

49:51.856 --> 49:53.990
I can definitely handle that.

49:54.025 --> 49:57.693
- Thank you.
- Okay.

49:58.463 --> 49:59.840
Well I should probably
let you get some rest,

49:59.864 --> 50:03.432
I mean the big event is
less than ten days away.

50:03.468 --> 50:05.501
You need to get healthy.

50:05.537 --> 50:07.370
Okay.

50:07.739 --> 50:10.006
No-no-no-no,
you stay right there.

50:10.041 --> 50:11.207
I want you to stay there.

50:11.242 --> 50:13.876
I'll lock the
door on my way out.

50:13.912 --> 50:19.682
You get nice and comfy.

50:22.587 --> 50:23.786
Go to sleep.

50:31.663 --> 50:34.063
Thank you.

50:34.098 --> 50:36.098
For everything.

52:36.689 --> 52:40.992
- Hello?
- Cara?

52:41.027 --> 52:43.361
- Hi!
- Hey!

52:43.396 --> 52:45.530
What a surprise.

52:45.565 --> 52:48.633
I haven't had a chance
to see this place yet.

52:48.668 --> 52:50.268
It's nice, I really like it.

52:50.303 --> 52:52.603
Me too, now that
I'm getting all settled in.

52:52.639 --> 52:55.206
- So, is everything okay?
- Yeah, what do you mean?

52:55.241 --> 53:00.111
You haven't like... called or
texted or anything in a while.

53:00.146 --> 53:02.647
I've been...
I had a cold last week.

53:02.682 --> 53:04.882
Cold? Mom, why
didn't you tell me?

53:04.918 --> 53:08.319
Well, I... because I've been
busy with the festival,

53:08.354 --> 53:10.521
and because I promised
to give you space.

53:10.557 --> 53:13.458
Yeah, but it doesn't need
to be like that much space.

53:13.493 --> 53:16.794
I mean especially if you're sick.
Besides, I've been worried.

53:16.830 --> 53:19.163
- You have?
- Yeah of course.

53:19.199 --> 53:20.298
Is everything else okay?

53:20.333 --> 53:21.699
- Yeah.
- With work.

53:21.734 --> 53:25.336
Well, the festival's on course,
and Cheryl is super happy.

53:25.371 --> 53:26.137
That's good.

53:26.172 --> 53:28.239
And what about you?
How's school?

53:28.274 --> 53:31.008
- All A's.
- I know.

53:31.044 --> 53:34.712
- Even in Professor Ferris' class.
- Really, is he a good professor?

53:34.747 --> 53:35.913
He is.

53:35.949 --> 53:39.395
And actually I'm learning a lot.
We should start our own garden.

53:39.419 --> 53:41.085
- That's a great idea.
- Yeah right?

53:41.120 --> 53:42.153
Yeah.

53:45.124 --> 53:47.158
What?

53:47.193 --> 53:49.660
Well, it's the esteemed
Professor himself.

53:52.131 --> 53:53.731
Anyway.

53:53.766 --> 53:57.168
- Are you guys hanging out a lot?
- Well, we kinda have to.

53:57.203 --> 53:59.843
I mean there's so many moving parts
with an event like this and...

54:01.941 --> 54:03.975
<i>What?</i>

54:06.779 --> 54:08.179
You should go to him.

54:08.214 --> 54:10.615
- But you just got here?
- Go, I'm fine.

54:10.650 --> 54:12.283
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

54:12.318 --> 54:15.119
There's leftover pot roast
in the fridge, and some yams.

54:15.154 --> 54:17.021
And just lock up
before you leave, okay?

54:17.056 --> 54:18.689
Okay.

54:18.725 --> 54:23.194
- I love you.
- Okay thank you, I love you too.

54:23.229 --> 54:25.563
- Have fun.
- Bye.

54:50.356 --> 54:54.091
Okay, I'm here.
Now what?

54:57.130 --> 54:59.897
You've really been
working hard here.

54:59.933 --> 55:01.899
<i>It looks nice.</i>

55:01.935 --> 55:04.235
Thank you.

55:04.270 --> 55:07.271
Okay, I'm at the first turn.

55:07.307 --> 55:09.974
Okay, go right.

55:10.009 --> 55:12.410
I like how the path narrows.

55:13.046 --> 55:14.612
Okay, second turn.

55:14.647 --> 55:16.747
Make a left.

55:17.784 --> 55:18.994
Well, didn't have
a whole lot of room,

55:19.018 --> 55:21.586
so we didn't have much choice.

55:21.621 --> 55:23.421
Third turn.

55:23.456 --> 55:25.356
Right again.

55:31.064 --> 55:33.798
It really works
in this sort of...

55:33.833 --> 55:38.669
spooky, Goblet of Fire meets
Children of The Corn sort of way.

55:38.705 --> 55:41.305
That's a little disturbing.

55:42.446 --> 55:47.245
Yeah, well I never actually planned
on walking the corn maze myself.

55:47.880 --> 55:49.814
Which way.

55:49.849 --> 55:54.151
<i>I'm pretty sure that's a left.</i>

55:55.021 --> 55:58.100
- Pretty sure?
- Well. I got a little distracted

55:58.124 --> 56:01.258
with the whole ' Children
of the Corn ' thing...

56:01.561 --> 56:05.162
Okay, so can you
hear me without the phone.

56:05.565 --> 56:07.231
I dunno, shout something.

56:07.266 --> 56:08.566
Well, like what?

56:08.601 --> 56:11.469
<i>- Marco!
- Did you just Marco-Polo?</i>

56:12.905 --> 56:14.805
Well you come up
with something then.

56:14.841 --> 56:17.074
No, I like Marco-Polo.

56:17.110 --> 56:21.579
Okay, alright, try it again,
let me see if I can hear you.

56:21.614 --> 56:24.882
<i>- Marco!
- Oh I do hear you.</i>

56:24.917 --> 56:26.917
Polo!

56:26.953 --> 56:28.319
Marco!?

56:28.354 --> 56:30.855
Why is it that people
scream Marco-Polo?

56:30.890 --> 56:32.256
Polo!

56:32.291 --> 56:34.258
I have no idea.

56:34.293 --> 56:35.526
Marco!

56:35.561 --> 56:39.830
Maybe it's that somebody lets
a part of themselves out there.

56:39.866 --> 56:41.198
Polo!

56:41.234 --> 56:43.534
Marco!

56:43.770 --> 56:47.872
And then the other person
get it, and sends it back.

56:47.907 --> 56:50.841
- Polo!
- You're close.

56:50.877 --> 56:52.176
Marco!

56:52.211 --> 56:54.512
Until they find each other.

56:59.652 --> 57:01.218
- There you go.
- Thanks.

57:02.789 --> 57:04.288
You saved me.

57:14.434 --> 57:16.267
Okay.

57:16.302 --> 57:19.303
Fingers crossed, ready?

57:21.441 --> 57:24.208
- We got it! Okay c'mon.
- What?

57:24.243 --> 57:26.644
Yeah, c'mon up here.

57:26.679 --> 57:29.880
You're fine, you're fine.
You're not gonna walk back.

57:29.916 --> 57:30.934
There we go.

57:31.250 --> 57:32.407
There we go.

57:32.785 --> 57:34.785
Right in there.
You good?

57:34.821 --> 57:36.587
- Yeah.
- Okay.

57:36.622 --> 57:39.090
Right, let me release the brake.

57:39.492 --> 57:41.759
- You good?
- Yeah.

57:41.794 --> 57:43.260
Here we go.

57:53.039 --> 57:54.171
- You alright?
- Yeah.

58:08.187 --> 58:10.921
I wasn't really being serious.

58:10.957 --> 58:14.291
We have got to plan
this better next year.

58:14.327 --> 58:18.929
Or... you know,
whoever is in charge.

58:18.965 --> 58:24.201
C'mere for a second.

58:24.237 --> 58:25.269
There we go.

58:25.304 --> 58:28.873
- That's nice.
- Thank you.

58:28.908 --> 58:33.944
So you're definitely going back
to Los Angeles then after all this?

58:33.980 --> 58:38.382
I promised Cara.

58:38.417 --> 58:41.552
And if you hadn't promised Cara?

58:41.587 --> 58:45.256
I mean I've lived there so long.
I...

58:46.392 --> 58:49.693
What about you?

58:49.729 --> 58:54.031
What about me?

58:54.066 --> 58:55.633
<i>Hey...</i>

58:55.668 --> 58:58.536
Just thought I'd stop by,
and check out my investment.

58:58.571 --> 59:00.037
Edward, how are you?

59:00.072 --> 59:01.806
Thank you so much
for the donation.

59:02.675 --> 59:05.009
- We just finished the corn maze.
- Yeah.

59:05.044 --> 59:08.179
- Can I give you a tour?
- I would love that.

59:08.214 --> 59:11.182
- Noah, you wanna join us?
- No you guys go ahead,

59:11.217 --> 59:13.083
I gotta return the zero-turn
to my buddy's.

59:13.119 --> 59:16.720
But maybe we can finish
our conversation later.

59:16.756 --> 59:19.757
Yeah, maybe.

59:19.792 --> 59:23.561
Okay Edward, I'm really
excited to show this to you.

59:50.390 --> 59:52.724
Amy Andolini.

59:52.759 --> 59:55.393
Yes, hi Teddy.

59:56.396 --> 59:58.563
What?

59:59.266 --> 01:00:02.100
So, they're totally unavailable.

01:00:02.135 --> 01:00:03.968
Yes, the lead singer
of Mercury in Retrograde

01:00:04.004 --> 01:00:06.537
got a job in Toronto,
and the band broke up.

01:00:06.573 --> 01:00:08.640
The next time I pick
a band named after

01:00:08.675 --> 01:00:11.743
an astrological movement
known for bad communication,

01:00:11.778 --> 01:00:13.645
remind me to look elsewhere.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.749
So what are gonna do?
The festival is just in a few days.

01:00:17.784 --> 01:00:19.817
Can I just on record
saying how thankful I am

01:00:19.853 --> 01:00:22.253
that you didn't
just say "no band".

01:00:22.289 --> 01:00:24.389
I'm actually looking
forward to the band.

01:00:25.025 --> 01:00:28.059
What? I dance.

01:00:28.094 --> 01:00:29.894
<i>I do!</i>

01:00:29.929 --> 01:00:31.963
Well listen, our options
are limited,

01:00:31.998 --> 01:00:35.233
okay, and I did see
this band: McBanjo,

01:00:35.268 --> 01:00:37.001
I watched some of
their YouTube videos,

01:00:37.037 --> 01:00:38.303
and they're not half bad.

01:00:38.338 --> 01:00:41.172
"McBanjo"? That's their name?
Are they half good?

01:00:41.207 --> 01:00:44.142
If you're up for it, it says on their
website they're playing tonight

01:00:44.177 --> 01:00:46.444
at a place called
The Pretty Coyote.

01:00:46.479 --> 01:00:49.380
I know that place, okay great.
Sounds good.

01:00:52.285 --> 01:00:53.518
Hey.

01:00:53.553 --> 01:00:55.687
Private event folks,
you on the list?

01:00:55.722 --> 01:00:57.989
Can you tell us if McBanjo
is even playing here.

01:00:58.024 --> 01:00:59.190
No.

01:00:59.225 --> 01:01:01.526
Why is it some
sort of state secret?

01:01:01.561 --> 01:01:03.461
No, as in they're
not playing tonight.

01:01:03.496 --> 01:01:07.131
- Gosh, now what?
- Hey do you hear that?

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:12.804
Isn't that the place
that we got the cider?

01:01:14.374 --> 01:01:15.840
- Let's check it out.
- Okay.

01:01:25.552 --> 01:01:27.318
Hey that's our waitress.

01:01:44.170 --> 01:01:45.236
Thank you.

01:01:54.214 --> 01:01:57.382
- To Fall Spice.
- Yes!

01:02:03.556 --> 01:02:04.622
She's good.

01:02:04.657 --> 01:02:06.769
- Are you thinking what...
- What you're thinkin', I am.

01:02:06.793 --> 01:02:09.360
Well, let's go talk
to her after, okay?

01:02:09.396 --> 01:02:10.661
Okay.

01:02:10.697 --> 01:02:13.731
- There's still one test though.
- What?

01:02:13.767 --> 01:02:16.534
Whether or not we can dance
to her, c'mon.

01:02:16.569 --> 01:02:17.702
What, to this?

01:03:06.019 --> 01:03:07.819
That was so good!

01:03:07.854 --> 01:03:08.820
Thanks guys.

01:03:08.855 --> 01:03:11.656
This next one is a song
that I wrote last year.

01:04:16.823 --> 01:04:18.623
Well I think our
replacement singer

01:04:18.658 --> 01:04:20.958
is even better
than our original band.

01:04:20.994 --> 01:04:24.228
Amy...

01:04:24.264 --> 01:04:25.796
I had a...

01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.100
really nice time tonight.

01:04:29.435 --> 01:04:31.068
You did?

01:04:34.607 --> 01:04:36.116
And...

01:04:39.379 --> 01:04:42.480
Dancing with you,
that was my favorite part.

01:04:50.723 --> 01:04:52.223
Noah...

01:04:52.258 --> 01:04:56.027
It's been a while
since I've kissed anyone.

01:05:08.541 --> 01:05:11.876
- I changed my mind.
- Yeah?

01:05:11.911 --> 01:05:14.545
This is my favorite part.

01:05:31.467 --> 01:05:32.595
Goodnight.

01:05:33.766 --> 01:05:35.566
Goodnight.

01:06:13.039 --> 01:06:14.672
Hello Marcus.

01:06:14.707 --> 01:06:18.342
To what do I owe
this late night call?

01:06:18.378 --> 01:06:19.777
I'm just calling to let you know

01:06:19.812 --> 01:06:22.647
that your plants
are still alive and thriving.

01:06:22.682 --> 01:06:25.316
Excellent update.

01:06:25.351 --> 01:06:31.055
- So you liking it up there?
- Actually, I am.

01:06:31.290 --> 01:06:32.223
Why...?

01:06:32.258 --> 01:06:35.426
Well because, a Realtor
who left that flyer

01:06:35.461 --> 01:06:36.627
dropped by the house earlier,

01:06:36.663 --> 01:06:40.631
she had a really interesting
offer, I emailed it to you.

01:06:40.667 --> 01:06:45.569
Sis, I...
I think you should consider it.

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.720
Okay.

01:08:50.897 --> 01:08:52.997
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:08:53.032 --> 01:08:57.234
I brought you
a pumpkin spice latte.

01:08:57.670 --> 01:09:01.104
Who said you can't teach
an old dog new tricks?

01:09:01.140 --> 01:09:03.974
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:09:05.278 --> 01:09:09.479
- How you doing, you okay?
- I got an offer on my house.

01:09:09.582 --> 01:09:11.715
I didn't even know
you were selling your house.

01:09:11.751 --> 01:09:16.921
Well, I'm not, it's just a spec offer
from a very ambitious Realtor.

01:09:16.956 --> 01:09:20.357
Well, was it at least
a good offer?

01:09:20.393 --> 01:09:24.261
It's easily the best offer
I could have imagined.

01:09:24.296 --> 01:09:25.261
Nice!

01:09:25.298 --> 01:09:28.599
- Well...
- Or not nice?

01:09:28.634 --> 01:09:30.935
I mean if I were
selling it would be, but...

01:09:30.970 --> 01:09:32.603
I'm not.

01:09:32.904 --> 01:09:37.140
I see... So you're definitely
going back to Los Angles

01:09:37.176 --> 01:09:39.877
after all this is over?

01:09:39.912 --> 01:09:45.316
My life is there,
and I've lived there so long I...

01:09:47.153 --> 01:09:50.054
That's I've got an appointment
with Maria's Bakery,

01:09:50.089 --> 01:09:53.057
they're sponsoring
one of our desert booths.

01:09:55.928 --> 01:09:58.462
Thank you for this.

01:09:58.497 --> 01:10:00.531
- You got it.
- Okay.

01:10:33.299 --> 01:10:34.865
I'm totally slowing down.

01:10:36.035 --> 01:10:37.279
Hey, did I tell you
we got a replacement act,

01:10:37.303 --> 01:10:40.437
and I think she's gonna be even
better than the original band.

01:10:40.473 --> 01:10:41.972
Really?

01:10:42.074 --> 01:10:44.975
Getting pretty good
at this whole event thing.

01:10:45.211 --> 01:10:46.944
Next year you're gonna
be running the show.

01:10:48.347 --> 01:10:50.381
Yeah, about that...

01:10:50.416 --> 01:10:53.217
The University of
Sydney came through.

01:10:53.252 --> 01:10:55.486
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

01:10:55.521 --> 01:10:58.689
Gonna miss you though buddy.
I think Cheryl will too.

01:10:58.724 --> 01:11:01.492
I think she was hoping to keep you
around a little longer maybe.

01:11:01.527 --> 01:11:03.160
Get Amy to convince you.

01:11:03.195 --> 01:11:06.597
Yeah...
Amy's not gonna be around either.

01:11:08.167 --> 01:11:09.867
Well, how'd it go last night?

01:11:09.902 --> 01:11:12.102
It was...

01:11:13.005 --> 01:11:14.505
It was amazing.

01:11:14.540 --> 01:11:18.709
It was the best night
that I've had in...

01:11:18.744 --> 01:11:20.544
in as long as I can remember.

01:11:20.913 --> 01:11:22.713
What's brought you
down to Earth buddy?

01:11:22.748 --> 01:11:24.448
Amy.

01:11:24.784 --> 01:11:27.518
I sense a theme.

01:11:27.553 --> 01:11:31.655
Yeah. Well, she's not ready
to move on,

01:11:31.691 --> 01:11:33.757
start a life
outside of Los Angeles.

01:11:33.793 --> 01:11:35.759
Well I'm sorry
to hear that buddy.

01:11:35.795 --> 01:11:38.262
I was hoping Amy would give
you a reason to stick around.

01:11:38.297 --> 01:11:39.697
Yeah.

01:11:39.732 --> 01:11:41.598
Well...

01:11:41.634 --> 01:11:44.101
Not this time.

01:11:46.372 --> 01:11:48.238
Chloe has signed
her contract already,

01:11:48.274 --> 01:11:52.009
and Maria's Bakery has agreed
to be our final food vendor.

01:11:53.212 --> 01:11:55.713
I'll make sure Josie or
whoever her temp replacement is

01:11:55.748 --> 01:11:57.715
has all the contact info,

01:11:57.750 --> 01:12:00.784
so that they can use
it for the spring events.

01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:02.786
Great, but it won't be Josie,

01:12:02.822 --> 01:12:04.722
because her
husband's in the military,

01:12:04.757 --> 01:12:07.524
and got transferred to Oklahoma.

01:12:08.461 --> 01:12:10.594
You know you could
make this very easy on me.

01:12:10.629 --> 01:12:11.862
I can't.

01:12:11.897 --> 01:12:15.766
I made a promise to Cara that
I would go back to Los Angeles

01:12:15.801 --> 01:12:17.401
when the festival was over.

01:12:17.436 --> 01:12:20.304
Well you two are so close,
I'm sure she'd understand.

01:12:20.339 --> 01:12:22.706
But this, it's time for
her to make her own way.

01:12:22.742 --> 01:12:24.908
You know, without me underfoot.

01:12:24.944 --> 01:12:29.380
If Noah was staying,
would you reconsider?

01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:31.615
Is he leaving for sure?

01:12:31.650 --> 01:12:34.952
Burt called earlier,
told me Sydney made the offer.

01:12:34.987 --> 01:12:37.721
- But did he take it?
- It sounded that way.

01:12:37.757 --> 01:12:40.357
Well then I guess that's that.

01:12:43.763 --> 01:12:46.797
Hey Rick, I'm good from here, just go
grab some of those pumpkins out back

01:12:46.832 --> 01:12:48.365
start bringing them out.

01:12:48.534 --> 01:12:50.667
Alright.

01:13:19.131 --> 01:13:22.699
Hey!
This looks so good.

01:13:22.735 --> 01:13:26.136
It's gonna be fantastic
when it's all said and done.

01:13:26.172 --> 01:13:28.672
- I don't doubt that.
- Thank you.

01:13:28.707 --> 01:13:30.507
So what brings you by,
sweetheart.

01:13:30.543 --> 01:13:33.277
I was talking with Uncle Marcus,
and he mentioned something

01:13:33.312 --> 01:13:35.446
about someone wanting our house, or...

01:13:35.481 --> 01:13:36.814
Yes, there's a real estate agent

01:13:36.849 --> 01:13:38.649
that's trying to stir up
business, but no,

01:13:38.684 --> 01:13:41.351
- I'm not selling our house.
- Why not?

01:13:41.387 --> 01:13:44.288
Why not?
Because it's our home.

01:13:44.690 --> 01:13:49.525
I'm just saying, I'd be okay
if you wanted to.

01:13:51.130 --> 01:13:55.032
Mrs. Morgan offered you
that job, didn't she?

01:13:55.067 --> 01:13:57.968
How did you hear that Josie
wasn't coming back?

01:13:58.003 --> 01:13:59.670
I didn't.

01:13:59.705 --> 01:14:03.407
I just figured she'd find a way
to keep you here somehow.

01:14:03.442 --> 01:14:06.410
I mean you're pretty good
at everything you do so...

01:14:06.445 --> 01:14:07.978
What about your Independence and...

01:14:08.013 --> 01:14:12.116
I'm lucky to have you there
for me.

01:14:12.451 --> 01:14:15.185
I'd be lucky
to have you close by.

01:14:15.387 --> 01:14:18.388
- How close by?
- Oh gosh!

01:14:18.424 --> 01:14:21.391
We'll negotiate that.

01:14:28.067 --> 01:14:31.001
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

01:14:32.438 --> 01:14:34.438
Noah!

01:14:35.174 --> 01:14:36.207
Hi.

01:14:38.578 --> 01:14:42.179
It's looking really good.
Very, very festive.

01:14:42.415 --> 01:14:43.447
You okay with that?

01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:48.452
I'm beginning to see some validity
to your perspective, yes.

01:14:48.487 --> 01:14:51.922
- You sound like a professor.
- Well, you know...

01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:54.625
So I was talking to Cheryl,
and she said you got the position

01:14:54.660 --> 01:14:57.228
at the University of Sydney.

01:14:57.263 --> 01:14:58.329
I did.

01:14:58.364 --> 01:15:00.965
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:15:08.007 --> 01:15:11.075
What about you, are you
gonna head back to Los Angeles

01:15:11.110 --> 01:15:12.610
when you're all finished up here?

01:15:12.645 --> 01:15:15.045
- Yeah, that's the plan.
- Okay.

01:15:15.314 --> 01:15:17.581
Well, make sure that you...

01:15:17.617 --> 01:15:19.483
make sure that you say
goodbye before you go.

01:15:19.518 --> 01:15:20.818
Of course.

01:15:22.455 --> 01:15:24.088
Okay.

01:15:24.123 --> 01:15:26.323
'Cause...

01:15:27.126 --> 01:15:28.492
I'm gonna miss ya.

01:15:28.527 --> 01:15:30.094
You know, it's only been
a few weeks,

01:15:30.129 --> 01:15:32.162
but you make a big impression,
I'll say that.

01:15:33.165 --> 01:15:35.833
Well, I feel the same way...

01:15:35.868 --> 01:15:37.868
Impression-wise.

01:15:42.842 --> 01:15:45.342
Noah...

01:15:45.678 --> 01:15:47.778
I'm gonna miss you too.

01:16:16.343 --> 01:16:18.844
Two bucks man, fair price.

01:16:18.879 --> 01:16:21.446
Alright thanks man, for sure.

01:16:22.249 --> 01:16:24.049
I know me too.
Hi!

01:16:24.084 --> 01:16:26.718
- Hey!
- Hey!

01:16:26.754 --> 01:16:28.854
Well...

01:16:28.889 --> 01:16:33.358
You were right, this is very
different than past Harvest Festivals.

01:16:33.393 --> 01:16:37.229
- In a good way?
- In a great way, yeah.

01:16:37.264 --> 01:16:39.442
There's definitely going to
be a Harvest Fest next year.

01:16:39.466 --> 01:16:40.365
Yep.

01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.834
Hey, thank you for
all your help really.

01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:46.304
Thank you.
You did great work here.

01:16:46.573 --> 01:16:48.907
Not bad for an accountant
from Los Angeles.

01:16:51.145 --> 01:16:54.045
Well...

01:17:00.254 --> 01:17:01.820
Excuse me.

01:17:01.922 --> 01:17:02.922
Hey guys.

01:17:05.559 --> 01:17:07.926
Was everything okay
with Professor Farris?

01:17:07.961 --> 01:17:10.395
Yeah, Noah he's Professor Ferris

01:17:10.430 --> 01:17:15.400
is moving to Australia at the end
of the Semester, that's all.

01:17:15.435 --> 01:17:18.069
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry,
that's too bad.

01:17:18.105 --> 01:17:19.037
Why?

01:17:19.072 --> 01:17:21.673
It just seemed like
you really liked him.

01:17:23.744 --> 01:17:26.689
You know what, hey, I...
I've been meaning to tell you,

01:17:26.713 --> 01:17:29.047
you know, I'm sorry
I brought Mr. Hugsy up here,

01:17:29.082 --> 01:17:32.117
but now I've been looking for him,
and I can't seem to find him.

01:17:32.152 --> 01:17:35.887
Well, I sort of noticed him
when I came by your house.

01:17:35.923 --> 01:17:41.293
I had a Geology midterm,
so I took him.

01:17:41.328 --> 01:17:43.795
- And was he helpful?
- Well, I aced it!

01:17:43.831 --> 01:17:47.566
- So you were right!
- Yay! I know.

01:17:50.337 --> 01:17:53.805
Hey.
Nice to see ya.

01:18:41.788 --> 01:18:43.521
What do you think of
your investment now?

01:18:44.925 --> 01:18:47.959
It's wonderful.

01:18:48.128 --> 01:18:49.594
We sold out of apples

01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:51.229
and got bookings
all through spring

01:18:51.265 --> 01:18:52.864
for folks that wanna pick
their own.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:57.035
- And signed up two more stores.
- I am so happy it's working out.

01:18:57.070 --> 01:19:01.339
And that is why she is gonna
take over the orchard for me.

01:19:01.375 --> 01:19:02.741
Maddy's also trying to figure out

01:19:02.776 --> 01:19:04.843
how we're gonna
top this next year.

01:19:06.146 --> 01:19:07.445
That's what I'd like to know,

01:19:07.481 --> 01:19:09.748
and our esteemed
school president.

01:19:09.783 --> 01:19:12.584
- I do have some ideas.
- You do, do you, do tell.

01:19:12.619 --> 01:19:16.254
- Well I will, when you hire me officially.
- Wha... seriously?

01:19:16.290 --> 01:19:19.858
I talked to Cara and it
turns out she wouldn't mind

01:19:19.893 --> 01:19:22.894
having me here
after all within reason,

01:19:22.930 --> 01:19:26.531
and I'm thinking here might be
the next step, if the offer is still...

01:19:26.566 --> 01:19:27.777
It's still...
it's still... It's still!

01:19:27.801 --> 01:19:29.100
Yay!

01:19:35.142 --> 01:19:36.142
Hey.

01:19:36.176 --> 01:19:37.242
Professor Ferris.

01:19:37.277 --> 01:19:39.744
Hey. Cara, how you doin'
you having fun?

01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:40.780
- Yes.
- Good.

01:19:40.814 --> 01:19:43.882
My mom was saying
that you're leaving.

01:19:43.917 --> 01:19:45.417
I am, yes.

01:19:45.452 --> 01:19:49.254
I mean I was gonna wait
until I officially took the job

01:19:49.289 --> 01:19:53.858
before I made the big
announcement, but yes I am.

01:19:54.094 --> 01:19:57.062
So you haven't
accepted it yet...

01:19:57.097 --> 01:19:59.631
No, I mean I haven't yet because
of the timezone difference,

01:19:59.666 --> 01:20:01.666
and I think it's Spring Break
down there right now,

01:20:01.702 --> 01:20:04.436
but on Monday I'm gonna call
and make it official.

01:20:04.838 --> 01:20:06.504
That's really interesting...

01:20:06.540 --> 01:20:10.875
- Can you excuse me, for a second.
- Sure.

01:20:11.345 --> 01:20:14.479
- Hey Noah!
- 'Ey!

01:20:14.514 --> 01:20:15.981
Got a bit of an update
for you buddy.

01:20:16.016 --> 01:20:18.783
You do?
About what?

01:20:18.819 --> 01:20:20.752
Amy.

01:20:23.457 --> 01:20:25.657
Hey Mom?
Sorry.

01:20:25.692 --> 01:20:29.294
- Do you have a second?
- For you, I have whole minutes.

01:20:29.329 --> 01:20:32.297
I just had a conversation
with Professor Ferris...

01:20:32.332 --> 01:20:33.332
You did?

01:20:34.001 --> 01:20:37.302
I think you're gonna
find it very interesting...

01:21:00.394 --> 01:21:02.127
Have you seen Noah?

01:21:02.162 --> 01:21:05.330
- He just left.
- He left?

01:21:05.365 --> 01:21:07.565
Good luck...

01:21:16.510 --> 01:21:18.643
Marco!

01:21:22.115 --> 01:21:23.515
Marco!

01:21:28.088 --> 01:21:29.921
Marco...

01:21:29.956 --> 01:21:31.990
<i>Polo.</i>

01:21:34.561 --> 01:21:39.998
Is it true? You haven't
officially accepted the job?

01:21:40.033 --> 01:21:41.266
I have been hesitating,

01:21:41.301 --> 01:21:45.670
and I haven't exactly been sure
why until Burt just told me now,

01:21:45.705 --> 01:21:48.073
that you're staying here,
and taking the job here.

01:21:48.108 --> 01:21:49.074
I did.

01:21:49.109 --> 01:21:50.887
What about Los Angeles,
what about your house?

01:21:50.911 --> 01:21:52.911
Well, it's just...
it's just a house.

01:21:52.946 --> 01:21:57.348
And I wanna make new
memories in a new place...

01:21:57.384 --> 01:21:58.349
In this place.

01:21:58.385 --> 01:22:00.952
And my daughter's here,
and I have friends here,

01:22:00.987 --> 01:22:05.123
and, I think I found a job
that I'm really good at.

01:22:05.158 --> 01:22:06.791
Yeah, you are.

01:22:06.827 --> 01:22:08.460
And the only thing
that's keeping it

01:22:08.495 --> 01:22:13.868
from not being perfect
is your not being here.

01:22:15.068 --> 01:22:17.435
Well...

01:22:17.471 --> 01:22:21.306
- I can change that.
- Only if you want to.

01:22:21.341 --> 01:22:23.741
Believe me, I want to.

01:22:57.444 --> 01:23:00.411
Does this mean you're staying?

01:23:00.447 --> 01:23:03.114
Yeah.
That's what it means.

01:23:03.150 --> 01:23:04.649
Why?

01:23:04.684 --> 01:23:07.285
- Why?
- Why?

01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:09.888
For love, of course.
