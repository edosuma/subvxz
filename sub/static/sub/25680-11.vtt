Bernie, Zane, and Rodney
have gotten really close lately.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.014
We can't ruin that.

We're witnessing the birth
of a beautiful friendship.

Look, I'll admit

02:33.611 --> 02:35.196
the boys can be
a little annoying.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.990
But I haven't seen
Bernie this happy

02:40.577 --> 02:42.579
that Bernie's found
new buddies to hang out with.

02:42.662 --> 02:43.955
So I, for one,

02:44.039 --> 02:46.875
am happy to do my part
to nurture this new friendship.

02:46.958 --> 02:48.293

our house back.

03:02.223 --> 03:03.725
we can have peace
and quiet in the house

03:03.808 --> 03:04.934

03:05.018 --> 03:06.478
I think it's possible
to make everyone happy.

And you should channel that.

This morning, I got sore
skipping down the stairs.

what I'm gonna do

even talking about?

for this conversation.

forever to explain.

She wants something
special and unique,

05:28.828 --> 05:30.163
If I get her
the wrong thing,

05:30.246 --> 05:31.664
she'll just end up
returning it

05:31.748 --> 05:35.168

bath soap I got last year.

Yay!

05:59.484 --> 06:00.652
I haven't felt
this relieved

06:00.735 --> 06:02.654

gave me a full refund

06:02.737 --> 06:04.531

getting you money.

different stores

06:17.460 --> 06:19.546
It was at
the Scarecrow Emporium.

gone there first.

18:54.718 --> 18:55.969
Absolutely!

18:56.052 --> 18:57.345
They live on a California beach.

18:57.429 --> 18:58.888
It's totally their lifestyle.

18:58.972 --> 19:00.306
Great! Book 'em!

19:02.726 --> 19:05.228
Sorry, boys, you're fired!

19:05.311 --> 19:07.063
But if you could pop
some of these umbrellas

19:07.147 --> 19:08.273
in the cornbread
on your way out,

19:08.356 --> 19:10.358
that'd be a real Kentucky favor!

19:12.277 --> 19:14.404
Paige, I know your angle here,

19:14.487 --> 19:16.239
and if you think
for one second,

19:16.322 --> 19:17.657
I'm gonna let
those three bozos play--

19:17.741 --> 19:19.159
They're not bozos!

19:19.242 --> 19:22.746
They're friends
who happen to be bozos!

19:22.829 --> 19:23.830
And I haven't come this far

19:23.913 --> 19:26.958
just to let that friendship
die on my watch!

19:27.042 --> 19:27.876
[shouts]
Not on my watch!

19:29.669 --> 19:30.920
You know I'm a sucker

19:31.004 --> 19:33.798
for getting my own words
thrown back in my face.

19:33.882 --> 19:36.885
Now go get that band,
you beautiful people pleaser!

19:40.221 --> 19:43.016
Hey, this isn't
a piñata party.

19:43.099 --> 19:45.268
Where's the
nacho cheese waterfall?

19:47.228 --> 19:49.606
There's no bear in here!

19:49.689 --> 19:51.483
Guys, I'm sorry I tricked you.

19:51.566 --> 19:53.485
I just needed to get all three of you in
the same room to tell you something.

19:53.568 --> 19:55.153
Well, I don't wanna
be in the same room

19:55.236 --> 19:57.322
as Brad and Chad here.

19:57.405 --> 19:59.616
That's right!
I gave you boring nicknames.

20:00.909 --> 20:02.202
-Guys!
-Well, did you ever think

20:02.285 --> 20:03.411
that maybe me
and Brad don't--

20:03.495 --> 20:04.954
Wait, I'm Brad?

20:05.038 --> 20:06.164
How do you know
I'm not Chad?

20:06.247 --> 20:07.248
Ha!

20:07.332 --> 20:08.917
Like you could
pull off Chad.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.169
That's such a
Brad thing to say!

20:11.252 --> 20:13.254
Everybody's yelling,
so I'm yelling!

20:13.338 --> 20:14.172
[indistinct shouting]

20:15.840 --> 20:17.092
Guys, I booked you a gig!

20:18.343 --> 20:20.220
No way! A real gig!

20:20.303 --> 20:21.471
That's awesome!

20:21.554 --> 20:24.099
[boys chanting]
We are Paige's Idea!

20:25.183 --> 20:27.227
Wow! You made up that fast?

20:27.310 --> 20:28.353
[boys] We're ten!

20:30.397 --> 20:31.690
Funny, you're 15.

20:31.773 --> 20:34.234
Oh, I thought we were
ranking on general hotness.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.112
Yes.

20:37.195 --> 20:39.155
So, uh, a gig.
You guys want it?

20:39.239 --> 20:40.240
I do!

20:40.323 --> 20:41.449
Me, too!

20:41.533 --> 20:42.659
What do you think, Bernie?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.244
Yeah, Bernie.

20:44.327 --> 20:45.412
What do you think?

20:45.495 --> 20:46.663
The boys wanna know.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.249
What do I think?

20:49.332 --> 20:51.376
I'm glad you asked!

20:51.459 --> 20:52.836
The history of rock and roll

20:52.919 --> 20:54.587
has been filled
with important moments,

20:54.671 --> 20:56.965
but when people
look back on this day,

20:57.048 --> 20:58.258
they will say,

20:58.341 --> 21:00.844
nay, scream,

21:00.927 --> 21:02.679
that this is one of them.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.472
So grab your
instruments boys,

21:04.556 --> 21:07.308
because we have
booked ourselves a "gag!"

21:07.392 --> 21:08.226
[groans]

21:08.685 --> 21:09.728
I almost had it.

21:13.106 --> 21:15.525
Happy 10th birthday, Willow!

21:15.650 --> 21:17.277
[all] Surprise!

21:19.863 --> 21:23.283
Oh my gosh!
There's California stuff.

21:23.366 --> 21:26.202
But also... farm stuff?

21:26.286 --> 21:28.997
And what do you
think about that?

21:29.080 --> 21:30.665
Do you like it?
If not, Frankie did it.

21:32.250 --> 21:33.293
I love it!

21:33.376 --> 21:35.837
It was all me!

21:35.920 --> 21:37.172
I need better friends.

21:38.173 --> 21:39.174
Happy birthday, Willow.

21:39.257 --> 21:40.258
Thanks, Frankie.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.343
Thanks, Meels.

21:41.426 --> 21:44.220
I knew you'd plan
the perfect birthday.

21:45.889 --> 21:46.848
Hey, Olvera.

21:46.931 --> 21:49.726
Where's that California
beach band you promised?

21:49.809 --> 21:51.186
Here they come now.

22:02.864 --> 22:05.200
There is no way
those three bozos

22:05.283 --> 22:06.451
are playing this party!

22:06.534 --> 22:09.079
Amelia, you booked
Paige's Idea?

22:09.162 --> 22:10.288
I love them!

22:10.372 --> 22:11.247
You do?

22:11.331 --> 22:14.042
Yeah! I've been into them
since the beginning.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.002
They formed two days ago.

22:16.086 --> 22:17.212
Yeah! Since then!

22:18.338 --> 22:19.339
Well...

22:19.381 --> 22:21.424
that's exactly
why I booked them!

22:21.508 --> 22:23.301
All me! Nobody else!
Paige did nothing.

22:25.512 --> 22:27.097
We need better friends.

22:30.141 --> 22:32.143
Alright, boys,
you ready to rock this place?

22:32.227 --> 22:33.061
[boys hoarsely] Yeah!

22:33.478 --> 22:35.438
What happened
to your voices?

22:35.522 --> 22:37.607
[hoarsely] We were so excited when
you got the band back together,

22:37.691 --> 22:39.484
that we decided to have
a screaming contest.

22:39.567 --> 22:40.610
[boys] I won!

22:42.362 --> 22:43.488
[hoarsely]
Maybe we should cancel.

22:43.655 --> 22:45.323
We don't have anyone
who can sing.

22:48.368 --> 22:50.495
I think I know a singer
who's available.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.372
Happy birthday, Willow!

22:52.455 --> 22:54.374
The boys wrote
this one just for you.
