WEBVTT

00:00.233 --> 00:02.167
 TONIGHT ON THE PROFIT...

00:02.167 --> 00:04.600
 MARCUS, NICE TO MEET YOU.

00:02.167 --> 00:04.600
 I GO INSIDE JACOB MAARSE,

00:04.600 --> 00:07.567
A HIGH-END FLORIST AND GIFT SHOP

00:04.600 --> 00:07.567
IN PASADENA, CALIFORNIA THAT

00:07.567 --> 00:11.200
HASN'T EARNED A PROFIT SINCE ITS

00:07.567 --> 00:11.200
 FOUNDER DIED IN 2010.

00:11.200 --> 00:13.667
HOW MUCH MONEY WILL THIS

00:11.200 --> 00:13.667
BUSINESS LOSE THIS YEAR?

00:13.667 --> 00:17.633
 CLOSE TO 200,000.

00:13.667 --> 00:17.633
 SLOPPY BUSINESS PRACTICES...

00:17.633 --> 00:19.667
DO YOU HAVE AN INVENTORY SYSTEM?

00:17.633 --> 00:19.667
 NO.

00:19.667 --> 00:23.067
 TOGETHER WITH LAX MANAGEMENT

00:19.667 --> 00:23.067
HAS DRIVEN DOWN SALES AND PILED

00:23.067 --> 00:25.133
UP DEBT.

00:23.067 --> 00:25.133
SO ARE WE GOING THE RIGHT WAY?

00:25.133 --> 00:27.100
 I BELIEVE SO.

00:25.133 --> 00:27.100
 WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE WE'RE

00:27.100 --> 00:28.900
GOING.

00:27.100 --> 00:28.900
IF THEY DON'T MAKE CHANGES, THIS

00:28.900 --> 00:33.067
47-YEAR-OLD FAMILY BUSINESS WILL

00:28.900 --> 00:33.067
BE FORCED TO CLOSE ITS DOORS.

00:33.067 --> 00:36.867
THIS BUSINESS IS A TOTAL MESS.

00:33.067 --> 00:36.867
I'M FIGHTING AGAINST TIME TO

00:36.867 --> 00:38.533
LIGHT A FIRE UNDER THESE

00:36.867 --> 00:38.533
PEOPLE...

00:38.533 --> 00:41.667
THIS IS THE THING THAT WILL HELP

00:38.533 --> 00:41.667
US GO FROM THE RED TO THE BLACK

00:41.667 --> 00:44.400
IN ONE MONTH.

00:41.667 --> 00:44.400
BEFORE THIS BUSINESS CRUMBLES

00:44.400 --> 00:48.300
AND DOZENS OF EMPLOYEES ARE OUT

00:44.400 --> 00:48.300
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO MANAGE

00:48.300 --> 00:48.967
THIS PLACE.

00:48.300 --> 00:48.967
ON THE STREET.

00:48.967 --> 00:52.900
 WELL...[blathers]

00:48.967 --> 00:52.900
 MY NAME IS MARCUS LEMONIS,

00:52.900 --> 00:57.300
AND I FIX FAILING BUSINESSES.

00:52.900 --> 00:57.300
I WANT 25%.

00:57.300 --> 00:59.200
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A DECISION

00:57.300 --> 00:59.200
NOW.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.633
I MAKE TOUGH DECISIONS...

00:59.200 --> 01:02.633
YOU'RE BEING DEMOTED.

01:02.633 --> 01:05.833
BACK THEM UP WITH MY OWN CASH.

01:02.633 --> 01:05.833
IT'S NOT ALWAYS PRETTY.

01:05.833 --> 01:08.000
GET YOUR ASS BACK HERE RIGHT

01:05.833 --> 01:08.000
NOW.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.933
THIS IS BUSINESS.

01:08.000 --> 01:10.933
I DO IT TO SAVE JOBS, AND I DO

01:10.933 --> 01:13.667
IT TO MAKE MONEY.

01:10.933 --> 01:13.667
THIS IS THE PROFIT.

01:13.667 --> 01:23.767
[upbeat music]

01:13.667 --> 01:23.767
â™ª â™ª

01:23.767 --> 01:26.833
JACOB MAARSE FLORISTS IS

01:23.767 --> 01:26.833
A PASADENA INSTITUTION.

01:26.833 --> 01:29.967
FOR 52 YEARS HE WAS THE GO-TO

01:26.833 --> 01:29.967
FLORIST.

01:29.967 --> 01:33.100
THE BUSINESS MADE MILLIONS

01:29.967 --> 01:33.100
PRESIDENTIAL INAUGURATIONS,

01:33.100 --> 01:35.300
CELEBRITY EVENTS, AND THE ANNUAL

01:33.100 --> 01:35.300
SUPPLYING FLOWERS FOR

01:35.300 --> 01:39.900
ROSE BOWL PARADE.

01:35.300 --> 01:39.900
WHEN JACOB DIED IN 2010, HIS SON

01:39.900 --> 01:43.167
HANK TOOK OVER THE BUSINESS.

01:39.900 --> 01:43.167
IT'S BEEN A VERY TOUGH

01:43.167 --> 01:46.267
TRANSITION.

01:43.167 --> 01:46.267
HANK HAS STRUGGLED TO LEAD.

01:46.267 --> 01:47.733
 THERE'LL BE SOME GROWING

01:46.267 --> 01:47.733
PAINS.

01:47.733 --> 01:50.600
UM...

01:47.733 --> 01:50.600
SO, WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I'M ON

01:50.600 --> 01:53.867
THE TOP, I'M THE PRESIDENT,

01:50.600 --> 01:53.867
 JUST THREE YEARS LATER,

01:53.867 --> 01:58.033
REVENUE IS DOWN AND THOSE

01:53.867 --> 01:58.033
PROFITS HAVE TURNED INTO LOSSES.

01:58.033 --> 02:01.667
LAST YEAR MAARSE GENERATED

01:58.033 --> 02:01.667
$3.6 MILLION IN REVENUE BUT

02:01.667 --> 02:05.167
STILL SHOWED A LOSS OF $20,000.

02:01.667 --> 02:05.167
 BETWEEN THE PRICES AND THE

02:05.167 --> 02:07.800
DISAPPOINTING PRODUCT, I DON'T

02:05.167 --> 02:07.800
KNOW THAT I WOULD KEEP COMING

02:07.800 --> 02:09.233
BACK.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.233
 TO KEEP THE BUSINESS UP AND

02:09.233 --> 02:13.267
GOING, HANK TOOK A $200,000 LOAN

02:09.233 --> 02:13.267
FROM HIS MOM AND BORROWED

02:13.267 --> 02:17.933
ANOTHER $100,000 FROM THE BANK.

02:13.267 --> 02:17.933
 I WOULD AGREE WE'RE NOT

02:17.933 --> 02:20.667
MAKING MONEY.

02:17.933 --> 02:20.667
 RIGHT.

02:20.667 --> 02:25.333
 HANK HASN'T MADE A PROFIT IN

02:20.667 --> 02:25.333
THREE YEARS, AND HE'S $300,000

02:25.333 --> 02:27.433
IN DEBT.

02:25.333 --> 02:27.433
THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN FOR THE

02:27.433 --> 02:32.433
30-PLUS EMPLOYEES WHO DEPEND ON

02:27.433 --> 02:32.433
THIS COMPANY TO EARN A LIVING.

02:32.433 --> 02:36.800
THE FLOWER INDUSTRY GENERATES

02:32.433 --> 02:36.800
$6.5 BILLION A YEAR, AND I WANT

02:36.800 --> 02:39.267
A PIECE OF THAT.

02:36.800 --> 02:39.267
IF HANK MAARSE IS WILLING TO

02:39.267 --> 02:40.867
FOLLOW MY LEAD, I KNOW I CAN

02:39.267 --> 02:40.867
I'M THE OWNER.

02:40.867 --> 02:44.133
TURN THIS PLACE AROUND AND SHOW

02:40.867 --> 02:44.133
PROFITS WITHIN A VERY SHORT

02:44.133 --> 02:50.933
TIME.

02:44.133 --> 02:50.933
THERE IS SO MUCH STUFF IN HERE.

02:50.933 --> 02:54.033
THE LAYOUT OF THE STORE MAKES

02:50.933 --> 02:54.033
ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE TO ME.

02:54.033 --> 02:57.467
I MEAN, THERE IS MERCHANDISE

02:54.033 --> 02:57.467
EVERYWHERE.

02:57.467 --> 03:00.067
SEEMS LIKE A LOT OF STUFF.

02:57.467 --> 03:00.067
 [laughs]

03:00.067 --> 03:02.733
WHERE TO LOOK FIRST.

03:00.067 --> 03:02.733
I SEE CANDLES, I SEE GREETING

03:02.733 --> 03:04.233
CARDS, I SEE LOTIONS.

03:02.733 --> 03:04.233
 LIKE, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW

03:04.233 --> 03:06.300
HOW COULD YOU POSSIBLY SELL

03:04.233 --> 03:06.300
ANYTHING IF THE CUSTOMER CAN'T

03:06.300 --> 03:09.867
FIND WHAT THEY ACTUALLY NEED?

03:06.300 --> 03:09.867
CONFUSING YOUR CUSTOMERS IS AN

03:09.867 --> 03:12.500
ABSOLUTE GUARANTEE THAT YOU WILL

03:09.867 --> 03:12.500
LOSE MONEY.

03:12.500 --> 03:17.667
BURNED-OUT BULBS AND COBWEBS.

03:12.500 --> 03:17.667
IT'S FILTHY. IT'S DIRTY.

03:17.667 --> 03:21.567
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

03:17.667 --> 03:21.567
NO ARRANGEMENTS HERE. NOTHING.

03:21.567 --> 03:23.800
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR OVER

03:21.567 --> 03:23.800
FIVE MINUTES, AND I DON'T SEE AN

03:23.800 --> 03:26.567
EMPLOYEE ANYWHERE.

03:23.800 --> 03:26.567
ANYTIME I GO INTO A BUSINESS AND

03:26.567 --> 03:31.767
THEY DON'T GREET ME WITHIN THE

03:26.567 --> 03:31.767
AROUND AND LEAVE.

03:31.767 --> 03:27.867
HI, GUYS.

03:31.767 --> 03:27.867
WELL, THERE YOU ARE.

03:27.867 --> 03:34.767
FIRST FIVE MINUTES, I TURN

03:27.867 --> 03:34.767
 HELLO.

03:34.767 --> 03:36.100
 I'M MARCUS.

03:34.767 --> 03:36.100
 DAVID.

03:36.100 --> 03:37.933
 THERE'S BARELY ANY FLOWERS ON

03:36.100 --> 03:37.933
DISPLAY.

03:37.933 --> 03:40.233
AND THE FLORAL DESIGNERS, WELL,

03:37.933 --> 03:40.233
IT'S LIKE THEY'VE HIDDEN THEM IN

03:40.233 --> 03:41.967
THE BACK.

03:40.233 --> 03:41.967
WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT TO PUT

03:41.967 --> 03:44.100
YOUR MOST IMPORTANT ASSET FRONT

03:41.967 --> 03:44.100
AND CENTER?

03:44.100 --> 03:46.667
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I FIND HANK?

03:44.100 --> 03:46.667
AS I WALK THROUGH THE STORE, I

03:46.667 --> 03:49.433
DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE HANK IS.

03:46.667 --> 03:49.433
DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHERE HANK IS?

03:49.433 --> 03:51.867
THIS GUY'S SUPPOSED TO BE THE

03:49.433 --> 03:51.867
BUSINESS OWNER?

03:51.867 --> 03:54.667
HE'S ASKED ME TO COME, AND I

03:51.867 --> 03:54.667
CAN'T FIND HIM ANYWHERE.

03:54.667 --> 04:01.233
PROBABLY HAS HIS HANDS FULL WITH

03:54.667 --> 04:01.233
SOMETHING.

04:01.233 --> 04:04.467
OUT FRONT AND CENTER, ESPECIALLY

04:01.233 --> 04:04.467
IF SOMEBODY LIKE ME WAS COMING

04:04.467 --> 04:07.833
TO HELP.

04:04.467 --> 04:07.833
IF THIS WAS MY BUSINESS, I'D BE

04:07.833 --> 04:09.433
 I'M ACCUSTOMED TO THE OLD

04:07.833 --> 04:09.433
SCHOOL.

04:09.433 --> 04:13.300
WE HAD A VERY GOOD MANAGEMENT.

04:09.433 --> 04:13.300
 SOME OF THE REVIEWS I WAS

04:13.300 --> 04:16.267
READING ONLINE IS THAT THE

04:13.300 --> 04:16.267
BUSINESS REALLY CHANGED AFTER

04:16.267 --> 04:18.632
JACOB'S PASSING.

04:16.267 --> 04:18.632
 YEAH.

04:18.632 --> 04:19.966
PEOPLE COME IN HERE AND SAY,

04:18.632 --> 04:19.966
"WHAT'S HAPPENED TO

04:19.966 --> 04:22.067
JACOB MAARSE?"

04:19.966 --> 04:22.067
 WOULD HE HAVE ALLOWED THAT?

04:22.067 --> 04:25.900
 NO. NO.

04:22.067 --> 04:25.900
 HI. MARINA.

04:25.900 --> 04:24.333
 HOW ARE YOU?

04:25.900 --> 04:24.333
 both: NICE TO MEET YOU.

04:24.333 --> 04:28.533
 HELLO, I'M MARCUS.

04:24.333 --> 04:28.533
 YOU'VE BEEN HERE HOW LONG?

04:28.533 --> 04:31.800
 CLOSE TO TEN YEARS.

04:28.533 --> 04:31.800
 TEN YEARS?

04:31.800 --> 04:33.933
 I LOVE WORKING IN THE STORE.

04:31.800 --> 04:33.933
I GREW UP HERE.

04:33.933 --> 04:36.133
I MEAN, I GOT MARRIED HERE, I

04:33.933 --> 04:36.133
HAD A CHILD HERE, IT'S A DEAR

04:36.133 --> 04:38.233
PLACE TO ME, AND JACOB WAS

04:36.133 --> 04:38.233
A WONDERFUL MAN.

04:38.233 --> 04:40.133
 ARE YOU RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

04:38.233 --> 04:40.133
SHOWROOM?

04:40.133 --> 04:42.100
 YES.

04:40.133 --> 04:42.100
 SO WHY WOULD ALL THE BULBS BE

04:42.100 --> 04:45.100
BURNED OUT?

04:42.100 --> 04:45.100
 WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON GETTING

04:45.100 --> 04:47.567
NEW LIGHT FIXTURES.

04:45.100 --> 04:47.567
 AND THE COBWEBS, THOSE ARE

04:47.567 --> 04:49.533
FROM HALLOWEEN?

04:47.567 --> 04:49.533
 PROBABLY.

04:49.533 --> 04:52.067
 LEFT OVER FROM HALLOWEEN.

04:49.533 --> 04:52.067
 SOME OF THESE THINGS ARE

04:52.067 --> 04:55.033
DEFINITELY LONG OVERDUE.

04:52.067 --> 04:55.033
SO ANYTHING THAT'S GONNA MAKE

04:55.033 --> 04:57.300
THE BUSINESS A LOT MORE

04:55.033 --> 04:57.300
SUCCESSFUL AND GIVE A DIFFERENT

04:57.300 --> 05:00.367
TWIST TO IT, I'M ALL FOR IT.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.367
 YOU THINK THERE'S TOO MUCH

05:00.367 --> 05:02.533
STUFF IN HERE?

05:00.367 --> 05:02.533
 YEAH.

05:02.533 --> 05:04.133
 DO YOU GUYS THINK YOU HAVE

05:02.533 --> 05:04.133
GOOD INVENTORY MANAGEMENT?

05:04.133 --> 05:09.733
 INVENTORY MANAGEMENT--UM, AS

05:04.133 --> 05:09.733
FAR AS KNOWING WHAT'S COMING AND

05:09.733 --> 05:11.433
GOING?

05:09.733 --> 05:11.433
 WHEN I MEET A GENERAL

05:11.433 --> 05:14.000
MANAGER, I EXPECT THEM TO

05:11.433 --> 05:14.000
UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTALS OF

05:14.000 --> 05:17.167
BUSINESS, ESPECIALLY INVENTORY.

05:14.000 --> 05:17.167
YOU HAVE TO KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE,

05:17.167 --> 05:20.700
HOW MUCH IT COSTS, WHAT YOU'RE

05:17.167 --> 05:20.700
SELLING IT FOR, HOW OLD IT IS.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.133
ALL THOSE THINGS ADD UP TO

05:22.933 --> 05:26.100
IF YOU DON'T KNOW IT, HOW ARE

05:23.733 --> 05:26.100
YOU SUPPOSED TO MAKE MONEY?

05:33.267 --> 05:35.900
HANK, I'M MARCUS.

05:33.267 --> 05:35.900
 MARCUS, NICE TO MEET YOU.

 NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.833
HOW ARE YOU?

05:37.833 --> 05:39.167
 THANKS FOR COMING BY.

05:37.833 --> 05:39.167
DOING WELL. THANK YOU.

05:39.167 --> 05:40.633
 YOU'VE GOT A BEAUTIFUL SHOP

05:39.167 --> 05:40.633
HERE.

05:40.633 --> 05:41.967
 THANK YOU.

05:40.633 --> 05:41.967
 LOT OF HISTORY.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.433
 A LOT.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.433
 BY THE WAY, THAT'S A KILLER

05:43.433 --> 05:45.400
PICTURE OF YOUR DAD.

05:43.433 --> 05:45.400
 THANK YOU.

05:45.400 --> 05:47.600
 WHEN YOU TOOK OVER

05:45.400 --> 05:47.600
OFFICIALLY--YOUR DAD PASSED TWO

05:47.600 --> 05:49.167
YEARS AGO?

05:47.600 --> 05:49.167
 YES.

05:49.167 --> 05:50.833
 IS THAT WHEN YOU OFFICIALLY

05:49.167 --> 05:50.833
KIND OF STEPPED IN?

05:50.833 --> 05:52.533
 YEAH.

05:50.833 --> 05:52.533
 HOW MUCH MONEY WILL THIS

05:52.533 --> 05:56.033
BUSINESS LOSE THIS YEAR?

05:52.533 --> 05:56.033
100,000?

05:56.033 --> 05:57.767
 NO. LESS.

05:56.033 --> 05:57.767
 AND LAST YEAR?

05:57.767 --> 06:00.500
HOW MUCH DID IT MAKE OR LOSE?

05:57.767 --> 06:00.500
 LAST YEAR WAS 20,000.

06:00.500 --> 06:03.533
 20,000. AND THE YEAR BEFORE?

06:00.500 --> 06:03.533
 A LOSS OF 20,000.

06:03.533 --> 06:06.233
40,000.

06:03.533 --> 06:06.233
 AND IF YOU HAD A COUPLE BAD

06:06.233 --> 06:09.067
MONTHS AND YOU RAN OUT OF CASH,

06:06.233 --> 06:09.067
WHAT DO YOU DO?

06:09.067 --> 06:11.833
 GET A LOAN FROM THE OFFICER.

06:09.067 --> 06:11.833
 YOUR MOM?

06:11.833 --> 06:13.867
 YES.

06:11.833 --> 06:13.867
 OKAY.

06:13.867 --> 06:17.300
AND HOW MUCH WOULD YOU SAY SHE'S

06:13.867 --> 06:17.300
PUT IN HERE IN THE LAST...

06:17.300 --> 06:21.133
THREE YEARS?

06:17.300 --> 06:21.133
 PROBABLY CLOSE TO 200,000 AS

06:21.133 --> 06:22.767
LOANS.

06:21.133 --> 06:22.767
 IS THAT THE ONLY DEBT ON YOUR

06:22.767 --> 06:25.900
BOOKS?

06:22.767 --> 06:25.900
 AND WE'VE USED OUR LINE OF

06:25.900 --> 06:27.733
CREDIT AT THE BANK.

06:25.900 --> 06:27.733
 HOW MUCH IS THAT?

06:27.733 --> 06:29.833
 100,000.

06:27.733 --> 06:29.833
 THAT'S TAPPED OUT?

06:29.833 --> 06:32.967
 YEAH.

06:29.833 --> 06:32.967
 OVER THE YEARS I'VE MET A LOT

06:32.967 --> 06:35.400
OF SECOND-GENERATION BUSINESS

06:32.967 --> 06:35.400
OWNERS.

06:35.400 --> 06:38.567
WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT HERE

06:35.400 --> 06:38.567
IS HANK'S MOTHER CONTINUES TO

06:38.567 --> 06:40.967
WRITE CHECKS TO KEEP THIS

06:38.567 --> 06:40.967
BUSINESS OPEN.

06:40.967 --> 06:44.567
WHEN YOU WALK IN THE FRONT DOOR,

06:40.967 --> 06:44.567
IF I SAID TO YOU, "OKAY, WHAT IS

06:44.567 --> 06:47.467
THIS PLACE?", HOW WOULD YOU

06:44.567 --> 06:47.467
DESCRIBE IT?

06:47.467 --> 06:50.067
 FLOWER SHOP.

06:47.467 --> 06:50.067
 YOU WOULD SAY A FLOWER SHOP.

06:50.067 --> 06:52.700
 AND GIFT SHOP.

06:50.067 --> 06:52.700
[laughter]

06:52.700 --> 06:55.067
 AND WHAT ELSE?

06:52.700 --> 06:55.067
AND CANDLE SHOP.

06:55.067 --> 06:56.733
IS SELLING FLOWERS THE MOST

06:55.067 --> 06:56.733
PROFITABLE?

06:56.733 --> 07:02.133
 TO BE HONEST WITH YOU...

06:56.733 --> 07:02.133
I DON'T KNOW.

07:02.133 --> 07:03.933
 YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO KNOW

07:02.133 --> 07:03.933
THESE NUMBERS, RIGHT?

07:03.933 --> 07:05.667
 YEAH, I KNOW I DO.

07:03.933 --> 07:05.667
 OKAY.

07:05.667 --> 07:12.600
DOES YOUR MOM EVER ASK YOU?

07:05.667 --> 07:12.600
 NO.

07:12.600 --> 07:08.067
OH, MY GOODNESS.

07:12.600 --> 07:08.067
THERE IS SO MUCH INVENTORY IN

07:08.067 --> 07:15.800
 OKAY.

07:08.067 --> 07:15.800
HERE.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.867
WHAT DO YOU THINK THIS IS?

07:15.800 --> 07:19.867
 YEAH.

07:19.867 --> 07:22.833
 THE WAREHOUSE LOOKS LIKE

07:19.867 --> 07:22.833
THEY'VE STOCKPILED FIVE YEARS'

07:22.833 --> 07:25.400
WORTH OF INVENTORY, AND IT'S

07:22.833 --> 07:25.400
UNORGANIZED.

07:25.400 --> 07:27.400
YOU KNOW HOW MANY ARE IN THIS

07:25.400 --> 07:27.400
PALLET?

07:27.400 --> 07:30.067
 UH...

07:27.400 --> 07:30.067
UH...

07:30.067 --> 07:32.233
 HANK HAS NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING

07:30.067 --> 07:32.233
ON AROUND HERE.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.867
THERE IS MERCHANDISE THAT'S BEEN

07:32.233 --> 07:34.867
HERE SINCE HANK'S DAD WAS

07:34.867 --> 07:37.300
RUNNING THE PLACE.

07:34.867 --> 07:37.300
HOW DO YOU KEEP TRACK OF ALL

07:37.300 --> 07:38.833
THIS STUFF?

07:37.300 --> 07:38.833
DO YOU HAVE A GOOD INVENTORY

07:38.833 --> 07:40.333
SYSTEM?

07:38.833 --> 07:40.333
 WE HAVE A BOOK THAT WE GO

07:40.333 --> 07:41.767
ALONG WITH.

07:40.333 --> 07:41.767
 HANDWRITTEN?

07:41.767 --> 07:43.400
 OH, YES.

07:41.767 --> 07:43.400
 SO NONE OF THIS STUFF IS IN A

07:43.400 --> 07:45.867
COMPUTER OR ANY SORT OF

07:43.400 --> 07:45.867
INVENTORY SYSTEM?

07:45.867 --> 07:48.200
 NO. NO.

07:45.867 --> 07:48.200
 WOW.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.900
WHEN YOU HAVE INVENTORY SIT

07:48.200 --> 07:50.900
AROUND FOR YEARS AND YEARS,

07:50.900 --> 07:55.667
WHILE IT'S DEPRECIATING, IT'S

07:50.900 --> 07:55.667
JUST LIKE BURNING MONEY.

07:55.667 --> 08:00.400
IS THERE A LOCATION IN L.A.?

07:55.667 --> 08:00.400
 THERE WAS.

08:00.400 --> 08:03.867
 WHEN DID THIS ONE CLOSE?

08:00.400 --> 08:03.867
 TEN YEARS AGO.

08:03.867 --> 08:07.300
 YOU CLOSED TEN YEARS AGO AND

08:03.867 --> 08:07.300
YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN IT OFF YET?

08:07.300 --> 08:10.600
NOW WHERE'S THE PHONE NUMBER?

08:07.300 --> 08:10.600
OR WHO DO YOU CALL?

08:10.600 --> 08:13.100
 I DIDN'T LIKE HAVING THE

08:10.600 --> 08:13.100
PHONE NUMBER ON IT.

08:13.100 --> 08:14.700
 YOU DON'T WANT ANYBODY TO

08:13.100 --> 08:14.700
CALL?

08:14.700 --> 08:16.467
 MM-MM.

08:14.700 --> 08:16.467
 NO, 'CAUSE THAT WOULD MEAN

08:16.467 --> 08:19.033
BUSINESS WOULD GO UP AND YOU'D

08:16.467 --> 08:19.033
HAVE TO WORK HARDER.

08:19.033 --> 08:20.567
 RIGHT, AND THEN I'D HAVE TO

08:19.033 --> 08:20.567
WORK MORE AND BUY MORE FLOWERS.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.500
 OKAY.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.500
 YEAH.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.933
 HANK IS SO LAX ABOUT HOW HE

08:22.500 --> 08:24.933
RUNS HIS COMPANY HE CAN'T EVEN

08:24.933 --> 08:28.933
BE BOTHERED WITH PUTTING A

08:24.933 --> 08:28.933
SIMPLE PHONE NUMBER ON HIS VAN.

08:28.933 --> 08:31.333
DOESN'T CHANGE HIS WAYS, MORE

08:28.933 --> 08:31.333
THAN 30 PEOPLE COULD LOSE THEIR

08:31.333 --> 08:27.933
JOBS.

08:31.333 --> 08:27.933
MAARSE DOES OVER $3.6 MILLION

08:27.933 --> 08:35.933
HE JOKES ABOUT IT, BUT, IF HE

08:27.933 --> 08:35.933
A YEAR IN SALES.

08:35.933 --> 08:38.700
AND FLOWERS ACCOUNT FOR 3/4 OF

08:35.933 --> 08:38.700
THAT.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.832
AND SINCE MOST OF IT IS

08:38.700 --> 08:40.832
DELIVERED, I NEED TO GET OUT AND

08:40.832 --> 08:45.800
SEE IF THIS DELIVERY PROCESS IS

08:40.832 --> 08:45.800
ACTUALLY WORKING.

08:45.800 --> 08:48.367
I WENT ONLINE TO LEARN MORE

08:45.800 --> 08:48.367
ABOUT THIS BUSINESS, AND THE ONE

08:48.367 --> 08:52.800
THING I NOTICED, THERE ARE A LOT

08:48.367 --> 08:52.800
OF COMPLAINTS ABOUT THE

08:52.800 --> 08:55.333
THEY GOT THERE.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.333
HOW MANY MILES ON THIS, DO YOU

08:55.333 --> 08:56.000
KNOW?

08:55.333 --> 08:56.000
DELIVERIES AND THE PRODUCTS ONCE

08:56.000 --> 08:59.167
 THIS VAN?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.167
116,000.

08:59.167 --> 09:01.333
 HOW'S IT RUN?

08:59.167 --> 09:01.333
 IT RUNS PRETTY GOOD.

09:01.333 --> 09:03.700
 DOES THE AIR WORK?

09:01.333 --> 09:03.700
 THE AIR IN THE VAN DOESN'T

09:03.700 --> 09:06.367
WORK, AND YOU'RE IN SOUTHERN

09:03.700 --> 09:06.367
CALIFORNIA?

09:06.367 --> 09:09.733
HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO DELIVER

09:06.367 --> 09:09.733
FRESH FLOWERS IN 90-DEGREE HEAT?

09:09.733 --> 09:13.767
NO WONDER PEOPLE COMPLAIN.

09:09.733 --> 09:13.767
SO ARE WE GOING THE RIGHT WAY?

09:13.767 --> 09:17.133
 I BELIEVE SO.

09:13.767 --> 09:17.133
 CHRIS, WE CAN'T DO IT THAT

09:17.133 --> 09:19.500
WAY.

09:17.133 --> 09:19.500
WE NEED--WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE

09:19.500 --> 09:21.400
WE'RE GOING.

09:19.500 --> 09:21.400
 I'M KIND OF AN OLD SCHOOL,

09:21.400 --> 09:25.867
ANALOG GUY, SO A MAP BOOK

09:21.400 --> 09:25.867
PROVIDES AN OVERVIEW OF THE AREA

09:25.867 --> 09:28.633
AS OPPOSED TO JUST "TURN LEFT,

09:25.867 --> 09:28.633
TURN RIGHT, TURN LEFT" KIND OF

09:28.633 --> 09:30.533
STUFF.

09:28.633 --> 09:30.533
 THEIR DELIVERY PROCESS IS

09:30.533 --> 09:33.367
EXTREMELY ARCHAIC.

09:30.533 --> 09:33.367
 THIS ISN'T LEGAL, BUT I'M

09:33.367 --> 09:35.700
DOING IT ANYWAY.

09:33.367 --> 09:35.700
 THEY HAVE NO GPS.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.133
THEY USE A MAP WHEN THEY'RE

09:35.700 --> 09:38.133
GONNA LEAVE THE STORE.

09:38.133 --> 09:40.500
THEY HAVE NO ROUTING SYSTEM.

09:38.133 --> 09:40.500
NO WONDER THESE DELIVERIES ARE

09:40.500 --> 09:44.533
LATE.

09:40.500 --> 09:44.533
IS THIS IT?

09:44.533 --> 09:46.233
 SO WE PASSED IT?

09:44.533 --> 09:46.233
 WE DID, 'CAUSE I WAS TOO BUSY

09:46.233 --> 09:42.100
YAPPING.

09:46.233 --> 09:42.100
 MAARSE SPENDS OVER A MILLION

09:42.100 --> 09:49.567
 NO. THIS IS 69.

09:42.100 --> 09:49.567
DOLLARS A YEAR BUYING FLOWERS,

09:49.567 --> 09:53.133
AND 10% OF THAT, $100,000, IS

09:49.567 --> 09:53.133
THROWN AWAY.

09:53.133 --> 09:55.633
A BETTER DELIVERY PROCESS AND

09:53.133 --> 09:55.633
WORKING COOLERS WILL CUT THAT

09:55.633 --> 09:58.900
NUMBER IN HALF.

09:55.633 --> 09:58.900
 DON'T HIT THE CAT.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.967
 EL GATO.

09:58.900 --> 10:01.967
[meowing sound effect]

10:01.967 --> 10:04.867
 JACOB MAARSE IS MARGINALLY

10:01.967 --> 10:04.867
UNPROFITABLE TODAY, BUT IT

10:04.867 --> 10:07.200
WOULDN'T TAKE MUCH TO RETURN IT

10:04.867 --> 10:07.200
TO ITS GLORY DAYS.

10:07.200 --> 10:10.200
A FEW SMALL CHANGES, AND THIS

10:07.200 --> 10:10.200
PLACE WOULD BE WILDLY PROFITABLE

10:10.200 --> 10:13.000
AGAIN.

10:10.200 --> 10:13.000
SO YOU HAVE A BUSINESS THAT HAS

10:13.000 --> 10:16.533
A BROKEN PROCESS, A GOOD

10:13.000 --> 10:16.533
PRODUCT.

10:16.533 --> 10:19.267
YOUR MOM PUTS MONEY IN THE

10:16.533 --> 10:19.267
BUSINESS, AND YOU HAVE TO RUN

10:19.267 --> 10:21.167
MOST OF THE DECISIONS BY YOUR

10:19.267 --> 10:21.167
MOM?

10:21.167 --> 10:22.967
 YES.

10:21.167 --> 10:22.967
 AND YOU'RE 49?

10:22.967 --> 10:26.867
 YES.

10:22.967 --> 10:26.867
 HOW'S THAT SOUND TO YOU?

10:26.867 --> 10:28.600
IT SOUNDS PRETTY [bleep].

10:26.867 --> 10:28.600
 UM...

10:28.600 --> 10:30.667
 LET'S PRETEND FOR A MINUTE

10:28.600 --> 10:30.667
THAT YOUR MOM DIDN'T WANT TO

10:30.667 --> 10:32.933
WRITE ANY MORE CHECKS.

10:30.667 --> 10:32.933
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THIS

10:32.933 --> 10:37.167
BUSINESS IN A YEAR?

10:32.933 --> 10:37.167
 I DON'T KNOW.

10:37.167 --> 10:39.833
 RUNNING A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS

10:37.167 --> 10:39.833
REQUIRES THE THREE Ps--PEOPLE,

10:39.833 --> 10:43.033
PROCESS, AND PRODUCT.

10:39.833 --> 10:43.033
AND MAARSE HAS A GREAT PRODUCT.

10:43.033 --> 10:46.267
BUT THEIR PROCESS IS LACKING.

10:43.033 --> 10:46.267
I THINK IT'S A DIRECT RESULT OF

10:46.267 --> 10:49.833
THE PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY HANK.

10:46.267 --> 10:49.833
AND PEOPLE COULD BE THE HARDEST

10:49.833 --> 10:52.900
THING TO FIX.

10:49.833 --> 10:52.900
SO DO YOU AGREE THAT YOU NEED

10:52.900 --> 10:55.667
A FINANCIAL PARTNER THAT'S NOT

10:52.900 --> 10:55.667
YOUR MOM?

10:55.667 --> 10:57.300
 YES.

10:55.667 --> 10:57.300
 DO YOU AGREE THAT YOU COULD

10:57.300 --> 10:59.900
USE A BUSINESS PARTNER THAT'S

10:57.300 --> 10:59.900
NOT YOUR MOM?

10:59.900 --> 11:02.833
 MM, I DON'T KNOW THAT I WOULD

10:59.900 --> 11:02.833
WANT TO HAVE A PARTNER.

11:02.833 --> 11:05.400
 YOU HAVE ONE NOW.

11:02.833 --> 11:05.400
 WELL, MY PARENTS, YEAH.

11:05.400 --> 11:10.100
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO MAINTAIN

11:05.400 --> 11:10.100
100% OWNERSHIP HERE.

11:10.100 --> 11:12.433
 HANK CALLED ME HERE BECAUSE

11:10.100 --> 11:12.433
HE WANTS MY MONEY, BUT WHAT HE

11:12.433 --> 11:15.800
REALLY NEEDS IS MY EXPERTISE.

11:12.433 --> 11:15.800
BUT THIS BUSINESS CAN ONLY

11:15.800 --> 11:18.133
SUCCEED IF HANK'S WILLING TO

11:15.800 --> 11:18.133
CHANGE HIS WAYS.

11:18.133 --> 11:21.467
HANK, LET ME BE VERY CLEAR.

11:18.133 --> 11:21.467
YOU NEED SOME HELP, AND YOU NEED

11:21.467 --> 11:23.800
IT NOW.

11:21.467 --> 11:23.800
YOU'RE GONNA KEEP CALLING YOUR

11:23.800 --> 11:28.033
MOM EVERY TIME YOU HAVE

11:23.800 --> 11:28.033
AM I WASTING MY TIME HERE, OR

11:28.033 --> 11:30.300
ARE WE ABOUT TO GET DOWN AND GET

11:28.033 --> 11:30.300
TO BUSINESS?

11:30.300 --> 11:33.300
WHICH ONE IS IT?

11:30.300 --> 11:33.300
COMING UP...

11:33.300 --> 11:36.633
MARINA, LOOK, I DON'T THINK HANK

11:33.300 --> 11:36.633
IS MAKING THIS VERY CLEAR.

11:36.633 --> 11:40.067
YOU'RE BEING DEMOTED.

11:36.633 --> 11:40.067
AND LATER...

11:40.067 --> 11:42.900
YOU HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT YOUR

11:40.067 --> 11:42.900
INVENTORY.

11:42.900 --> 11:24.767
 THIS PILE OF STUFF IS SITTING

11:26.000 --> 11:32.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

11:44.333 --> 11:48.133
HERE, AND WE STILL DON'T KNOW

11:45.333 --> 11:48.133
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH IT.

11:53.700 --> 11:56.633
 AM I WASTING MY TIME HERE, OR

11:53.700 --> 11:56.633
ARE WE ABOUT TO GET DOWN AND GET

11:56.633 --> 12:02.300
TO BUSINESS?

11:56.633 --> 12:02.300
WHICH ONE IS IT?

12:02.300 --> 12:04.433
IS THAT YOUR MOM?

12:02.300 --> 12:04.433
 YEAH.

12:04.433 --> 12:06.600
 IS SHE COMING HERE TO HELP

12:04.433 --> 12:06.600
YOU NEGOTIATE?

12:06.600 --> 12:10.567
SHE'S THE REAL CHECK-WRITER,

12:06.600 --> 12:10.567
RIGHT?

12:10.567 --> 12:12.433
HANK'S NOT THE DECISION-MAKER

12:10.567 --> 12:12.433
HERE.

12:12.433 --> 12:14.067
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:12.433 --> 12:14.067
 TO MEET YOU.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.500
 HE MAY OWN 100% OF THE STOCK,

12:14.067 --> 12:15.500
SO WHY DON'T WE BRING HER IN?

12:15.500 --> 12:18.800
BUT HE DOESN'T EVEN OWN 1% OF

12:15.500 --> 12:18.800
THE DECISION-MAKING.

12:18.800 --> 12:22.400
IN MY BRIEF DAY HERE--I WAS

12:18.800 --> 12:22.400
ASKED TO COME HERE BY HANK.

12:22.400 --> 12:23.900
I WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT

12:22.400 --> 12:23.900
THAT.

12:23.900 --> 12:26.367
I'VE CONCLUDED THAT THIS

12:23.900 --> 12:26.367
BUSINESS IS A TOTAL MESS.

12:26.367 --> 12:30.133
AND, MRS. MAARSE, I WISH JACOB

12:26.367 --> 12:30.133
COULD BE HERE, BECAUSE I'M SURE

12:30.133 --> 12:33.800
JACOB WOULD THROW ME OUT.

12:30.133 --> 12:33.800
BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS IS THAT I

12:33.800 --> 12:37.533
DON'T THINK THINGS WOULD BE THIS

12:33.800 --> 12:37.533
WAY IF JACOB WAS HERE.

12:37.533 --> 12:40.667
HANK, LOOK, IF YOU CONTINUE TO

12:37.533 --> 12:40.667
DO THE SAME THING, YOUR BUSINESS

12:40.667 --> 12:44.733
IS GONNA CLOSE AT SOME POINT.

12:40.667 --> 12:44.733
I KNOW THAT SHE CAN AFFORD TO

12:44.733 --> 12:49.067
WRITE CHECKS FOREVER BECAUSE SHE

12:44.733 --> 12:49.067
DOESN'T WANT HER HUSBAND AND HER

12:49.067 --> 12:51.100
NAME--

12:49.067 --> 12:51.100
 ABSOLUTELY.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.900
 OKAY, MRS. MAARSE, WHAT I'M

12:51.100 --> 12:53.900
TELLING YOU IS, IF YOU CONTINUE

12:53.900 --> 12:57.833
TO WRITE THE CHECKS ON A MONTHLY

12:53.900 --> 12:57.833
BASIS, HE WILL NEVER HAVE TO

12:57.833 --> 13:01.433
FEND FOR HIMSELF.

12:57.833 --> 13:01.433
HE NEEDS SOMEONE LIKE ME TO HOLD

13:01.433 --> 13:04.533
HIM ACCOUNTABLE FOR POOR

13:01.433 --> 13:04.533
PERFORMANCE.

13:04.533 --> 13:06.933
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE WILLING TO

13:04.533 --> 13:06.933
DO THAT, AND I UNDERSTAND WHY.

13:06.933 --> 13:09.200
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT

13:06.933 --> 13:09.200
THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO RUN

13:09.200 --> 13:11.967
THE BUSINESS.

13:09.200 --> 13:11.967
SO I'M GONNA GIVE YOU MY OFFER.

13:11.967 --> 13:14.800
 OKAY.

13:11.967 --> 13:14.800
 OKAY?

13:14.800 --> 13:16.900
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A CHECK FOR

13:14.800 --> 13:16.900
100,000.

13:16.900 --> 13:23.667
FOR THIS $100,000, I WANT 25% OF

13:16.900 --> 13:23.667
THE PROFIT SO THAT I'M

13:23.667 --> 13:27.233
INCENTIVIZED TO HELP YOU GROW

13:23.667 --> 13:27.233
YOUR BUSINESS WITH YOU SIDE BY

13:27.233 --> 13:31.467
SIDE.

13:27.233 --> 13:31.467
 I WAS THINKING MORE OF 20%.

13:31.467 --> 13:33.033
 HANK, LOOK, MY TIME IS

13:31.467 --> 13:33.033
VALUABLE.

13:33.033 --> 13:34.667
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE DOING

13:33.033 --> 13:34.667
THIS ALL NIGHT.

13:34.667 --> 13:38.267
25% IS REALLY THE NUMBER THAT I

13:34.667 --> 13:38.267
NEED THAT INCENTIVIZES ME TO DO

13:38.267 --> 13:40.867
THE THINGS THAT I THINK NEED TO

13:38.267 --> 13:40.867
BE DONE.

13:40.867 --> 13:44.367
INVESTING IN BUSINESSES IS

13:40.867 --> 13:44.367
BUT I ALWAYS GEAR MY OFFERS

13:44.367 --> 13:48.700
TOWARDS MINIMIZING MY RISK.

13:44.367 --> 13:48.700
THERE'S OVER $400,000 OF

13:48.700 --> 13:52.800
INVENTORY HERE, SO MY $100,000

13:48.700 --> 13:52.800
OFFER IS SAFE.

13:52.800 --> 13:53.800
IF THIS DEAL GOES BAD, I KNOW

13:52.800 --> 13:53.800
ALWAYS A RISK.

13:53.800 --> 13:57.567
FOR CERTAIN I'LL GET MY MONEY

13:53.800 --> 13:57.567
BACK.

13:57.567 --> 14:01.333
AND YOU UNDERSTAND, FOR THE NEXT

13:57.567 --> 14:01.333
WEEK, I'M 100% IN CHARGE.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.733
LAST YEAR, MAARSE LOST $20,000.

14:01.333 --> 14:04.733
BUT I KNOW WITH A FEW TWEAKS, WE

14:04.733 --> 14:07.733
CAN GO FROM LOSING $20,000 TO

14:04.733 --> 14:07.733
MAKING $1/2 MILLION VERY

14:07.733 --> 14:10.033
QUICKLY.

14:07.733 --> 14:10.033
I'M SO CONFIDENT THAT I CAN MAKE

14:10.033 --> 14:12.133
A DIFFERENCE, I'M WRITING

14:10.033 --> 14:12.133
A CHECK.

14:12.133 --> 14:16.600
 IS THIS A NOW OR NEVER DEAL?

14:13.900 --> 14:16.600
 YOU'RE GONNA MAKE A DECISION

14:14.700 --> 14:16.600
RIGHT NOW.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.900
 ALL RIGHT.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.900
I'M OKAY WITH THAT, FOR ONE

14:24.900 --> 14:27.667
WEEK.

14:24.900 --> 14:27.667
 BUT ALL I ASK IS THAT YOU

14:27.667 --> 14:30.867
DON'T SCREW ME.

14:27.667 --> 14:30.867
YOU DON'T TAKE MY MONEY.

14:30.867 --> 14:36.500
 WE'RE NOT THE TYPE.

14:30.867 --> 14:36.500
 YEAH, YOU WON'T FIND ANYBODY

14:36.500 --> 14:37.867
THAT--

14:36.500 --> 14:37.867
 WELL, WHY DID IT TAKE YOU

14:37.867 --> 14:39.967
A WHILE TO SAY THAT TO ME?

14:37.867 --> 14:39.967
YOUR MOM SAID IT RIGHT AWAY.

14:39.967 --> 14:41.767
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO THINK ABOUT

14:39.967 --> 14:41.767
IT?

14:41.767 --> 14:44.033
 I'M JUST SURPRISED YOU WOULD

14:41.767 --> 14:44.033
EVEN SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

14:44.033 --> 14:45.600
 WELL, SURE, YOU HAVE TO SAY

14:44.033 --> 14:45.600
THINGS LIKE THAT.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.900
 YEAH.

14:45.600 --> 14:47.900
 WE HAVE A DEAL?

14:47.900 --> 14:49.367
 THIS IS ALL DONE ON THE

14:47.900 --> 14:49.367
HANDSHAKE?

14:49.367 --> 14:52.433
 IS YOUR HANDSHAKE NOT GOOD?

14:49.367 --> 14:52.433
 MINE IS.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.833
 YOURS IS GOOD?

14:52.433 --> 14:53.833
 ALWAYS.

14:53.833 --> 14:56.133
 OKAY. WE HAVE A DEAL?

14:53.833 --> 14:56.133
 DEAL.

14:56.133 --> 14:59.000
 NOW THAT THEY'VE SHAKEN MY

14:56.133 --> 14:59.000
HAND, I'M DONE BEING A NICE GUY.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.767
I'M GONNA TEST THEM AND THEIR

14:59.000 --> 15:01.767
BUSINESSES IN WAYS THEY'VE NEVER

15:01.767 --> 15:04.000
BEEN TESTED BEFORE.

15:01.767 --> 15:04.000
LET'S GET TO WORK.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.333
 ALL RIGHT.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.333
 THANK YOU.

15:05.333 --> 15:13.267
THANK YOU AGAIN.

15:05.333 --> 15:13.267
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A STORE

15:13.267 --> 15:16.167
MEETING.

15:13.267 --> 15:16.167
PROFITABLE BUSINESSES NEED THREE

15:16.167 --> 15:20.533
THINGS: THE RIGHT PROCESS, A

15:16.167 --> 15:20.533
GREAT PRODUCT, AND GOOD PEOPLE.

15:20.533 --> 15:22.867
HERE, THEY NEED HELP WITH ALL

15:20.533 --> 15:22.867
THREE.

15:22.867 --> 15:25.533
MY NAME IS MARCUS LEMONIS, AND

15:22.867 --> 15:25.533
SOME OF YOU HAVE SEEN ME AROUND.

15:25.533 --> 15:28.200
AND I'M HERE TO HELP FIX THIS

15:25.533 --> 15:28.200
BUSINESS, SO PEOPLE DON'T LOSE

15:28.200 --> 15:31.733
THEIR JOB.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.733
THERE ARE 32 EMPLOYEES RELYING

15:31.733 --> 15:33.800
ON THIS BUSINESS FOR THEIR

15:31.733 --> 15:33.800
LIVELIHOOD.

15:33.800 --> 15:11.867
AND EVER SINCE JACOB'S PASSING,

15:33.800 --> 15:11.867
THEY'RE STARVING FOR LEADERSHIP.

15:11.867 --> 15:38.867
COULD ALL OF YOU JOIN US?

15:11.867 --> 15:38.867
FOR THE NEXT WEEK, I'M IN

15:38.867 --> 15:40.867
CHARGE.

15:38.867 --> 15:40.867
SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IS WE'RE

15:40.867 --> 15:44.200
GONNA MAKE SOME MASSIVE CHANGES,

15:40.867 --> 15:44.200
AND, AT THE END OF THIS WEEK,

15:44.200 --> 15:46.667
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GRAND

15:44.200 --> 15:46.667
REOPENING.

15:46.667 --> 15:48.800
TELL US IF WE'VE GOTTEN IT

15:46.667 --> 15:48.800
RIGHT.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.267
I NEED TO GET RID OF EXCESS

15:48.800 --> 15:51.267
INVENTORY, MAKE TIME-SAVING

15:51.267 --> 15:53.967
CHANGES, AND I NEED TO ORGANIZE

15:51.267 --> 15:53.967
WHAT'S LEFT.

15:53.967 --> 15:55.067
IN ORDER FOR THAT TO HAPPEN, I

15:53.967 --> 15:55.067
WE'RE GONNA LET OUR CUSTOMERS

15:55.067 --> 15:58.300
NEED TO PUT IN THE RIGHT SYSTEM,

15:55.067 --> 15:58.300
LIKE A BAR-CODING SYSTEM.

15:58.300 --> 16:02.000
THIS BUILDING LOOKS TERRIBLE.

15:58.300 --> 16:02.000
MAARSE HAS A VIABLE PRODUCT

16:02.000 --> 16:05.767
HERE, BUT, IN ORDER TO MAKE IT

16:02.000 --> 16:05.767
THE CUSTOMERS IN A WAY THAT'S

16:05.767 --> 16:07.833
APPEALING.

16:05.767 --> 16:07.833
THEY NEED TO SEE IT,

16:07.833 --> 16:09.833
AND IT NEEDS TO BE PRESENTED

16:07.833 --> 16:09.833
IN A LESS-CLUTTERED,

16:09.833 --> 16:11.300
LESS-DISORGANIZED MANNER.

16:09.833 --> 16:11.300
GOOD, WE NEED TO DISPLAY IT TO

16:11.300 --> 16:13.933
THE ENTIRE STORE NEEDS TO BE

16:11.300 --> 16:13.933
RE-MERCHANDISED.

16:13.933 --> 16:16.000
WE'RE GONNA BECOME PROFITABLE

16:13.933 --> 16:16.000
TOGETHER.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.800
SO, MARINA, YOU HAVE SOMETHING

16:16.000 --> 16:18.800
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY?

16:18.800 --> 16:21.733
 I AM EXTREMELY EXCITED TO SEE

16:18.800 --> 16:21.733
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

16:21.733 --> 16:25.833
AND THE FACT THAT WE ARE GONNA

16:21.733 --> 16:25.833
HONOR JACOB'S NAME IS EXTREMELY

16:25.833 --> 16:29.100
CLOSE TO THE HEART.

16:25.833 --> 16:29.100
 HANK.

16:29.100 --> 16:32.167
 UM, I DON'T KNOW.

16:29.100 --> 16:32.167
I'M JUST EXCITED THAT WE'RE

16:32.167 --> 16:37.333
GONNA ACTUALLY LIVE UP TO

16:32.167 --> 16:37.333
THE LEGACY THAT THEY BEGAN.

16:37.333 --> 16:40.767
 THAT YOU BEGAN, YOUR FAMILY.

16:37.333 --> 16:40.767
 THAT MY FAMILY BEGAN, YES.

16:40.767 --> 16:45.367
 OKAY?

16:42.267 --> 16:45.367
SO LET'S GO GET TO WORK.

16:43.467 --> 16:45.367
THANK YOU.

16:51.167 --> 16:55.267
WHAT I WANT TO DO IS HAVE YOU

16:51.167 --> 16:55.267
GUYS UNDERSTAND WHAT I THINK IS

16:55.267 --> 16:59.133
THE SINGLE BIGGEST REASON THAT

16:55.267 --> 16:59.133
THE PLACE LOSES MONEY TODAY.

16:59.133 --> 17:02.033
I WANT TO ACTUALLY MAKE

16:59.133 --> 17:02.033
AN ARRANGEMENT.

17:02.033 --> 17:04.333
THIS SIMPLE EXERCISE THAT I'M

17:02.033 --> 17:04.333
ASKING HANK AND THE TEAM TO DO

17:04.333 --> 17:06.967
ISN'T COMPLICATED.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.967
I WANT THEM TO TAKE A TYPICAL

17:06.967 --> 17:09.967
ARRANGEMENT AND BREAK IT DOWN

17:06.967 --> 17:09.967
INTO PARTS AND PIECES SO WE

17:09.967 --> 17:13.032
KNOW WHAT WE'RE SELLING THE

17:09.967 --> 17:13.032
PRODUCT FOR AND HOW MUCH EACH

17:13.032 --> 17:15.032
PIECE COSTS.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.032
THIS IS THE THING THAT WILL HELP

17:15.032 --> 17:18.599
US GO FROM THE RED TO THE BLACK

17:15.032 --> 17:18.599
IN ONE MONTH.

17:18.599 --> 17:21.200
 MARCUS HAS A GOOD REPUTATION

17:18.599 --> 17:21.200
AS FAR AS A BUSINESSMAN, BUT I

17:21.200 --> 17:25.666
DON'T KNOW THAT HE NECESSARILY

17:21.200 --> 17:25.666
KNOWS THE FLOWER BUSINESS.

17:25.666 --> 17:27.867
 SOMEBODY CALLED IN A $75

17:25.666 --> 17:27.867
ORDER.

17:27.867 --> 17:30.000
 WELL, I'M DO--THIS IS 85.

17:27.867 --> 17:30.000
 85, OKAY.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.900
 IT'S AN ACTUAL ORDER.

17:30.000 --> 17:31.900
 SO THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT GO

17:31.900 --> 17:36.667
INTO THIS ARRANGEMENT--RAW

17:31.900 --> 17:36.667
MATERIALS AND LABOR.

17:36.667 --> 17:38.333
HOW MUCH IS THE BOWL?

17:36.667 --> 17:38.333
 TEN.

17:38.333 --> 17:40.200
 HOW MUCH IS YOUR TIME?

17:38.333 --> 17:40.200
 15 MINUTES.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.433
 15 MINUTES AT 20 BUCKS IS HOW

17:40.200 --> 17:42.433
MUCH?

17:42.433 --> 17:45.700
 $5.

17:42.433 --> 17:45.700
 SO NOW WE'RE UP TO $15.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.867
OKAY, KEEP GOING.

17:45.700 --> 17:48.867
HOW MUCH ARE THE HYDRANGEA?

17:48.867 --> 17:51.167
 THE HYDRANGEAS ARE $3 EACH

17:48.867 --> 17:51.167
FOR THE WHITE.

17:51.167 --> 17:54.733
 SO NOW WE'RE AT $33.

17:51.167 --> 17:54.733
HOW MUCH ARE THE TULIPS?

17:54.733 --> 17:58.933
 $15 A BUNCH.

17:54.733 --> 17:58.933
 OKAY, SO NOW WE'RE AT $48.

17:58.933 --> 18:01.500
 ONE BUNCH OF HYACINTHS,

17:58.933 --> 18:01.500
THEY'RE $15 A BUNCH.

18:01.500 --> 18:05.533
 OKAY, NOW WE'RE AT $63.

18:01.500 --> 18:05.533
 I'M GONNA DO GARDEN ROSES.

18:05.533 --> 18:08.033
 HOW MUCH IS THAT?

18:05.533 --> 18:08.033
 2.50 EACH.

18:08.033 --> 18:11.800
 7.50?

18:08.033 --> 18:11.800
WE'RE AT $70.50 RIGHT NOW.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.533
 THREE STEMS OF LILAC.

18:11.800 --> 18:15.533
LILAC IS $60 A BUNCH.

18:15.533 --> 18:17.400
 SO WE'LL CALL IT $3 FOR THIS

18:15.533 --> 18:17.400
DISCUSSION?

18:17.400 --> 18:21.167
 SOUNDS GOOD, YEAH.

18:17.400 --> 18:21.167
 SO WE'RE AT $81 IN COST.

18:21.167 --> 18:24.733
SO IF YOU'RE SELLING THIS FOR

18:21.167 --> 18:24.733
$85, YOU KNOW WHAT, GOOD JOB.

18:24.733 --> 18:26.900
WE JUST MADE $4.

18:24.733 --> 18:26.900
SO THAT'S YET TO BE SEEN.

18:26.900 --> 18:29.400
PRICING AT JACOB MAARSE HASN'T

18:26.900 --> 18:29.400
CHANGED IN YEARS.

18:29.400 --> 18:32.233
THE COST OF MATERIALS HAS GONE

18:29.400 --> 18:32.233
UP, BUT THEY HAVEN'T RAISED THE

18:32.233 --> 18:34.867
PRICE TO THE RETAIL CONSUMER AT

18:32.233 --> 18:34.867
THE SAME TIME.

18:34.867 --> 18:36.900
SO IF YOU LOOK AT A SIMPLE

18:34.867 --> 18:36.900
ARRANGEMENT, AND THE COST USED

18:36.900 --> 18:42.200
TO BE $75, AND NOW THE COST IS

18:36.900 --> 18:42.200
$85, YOU CAN'T PRICE IT AT $85.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.533
YOU HAVE TO MOVE THE NUMBERS UP

18:44.733 --> 18:48.967
THESE MARGINS AREN'T ACCEPTABLE.

18:46.533 --> 18:48.967
WE CAN'T MAKE MONEY THAT WAY.

18:56.100 --> 18:59.433
CAN YOU GRAB THIS WITH ME?

18:56.100 --> 18:59.433
WE'RE ALL WORKING TO GET THIS

18:59.433 --> 19:03.033
WAREHOUSE CLEANED UP.

18:59.433 --> 19:03.033
GET READY FOR THIS RE-GRAND

19:03.033 --> 19:05.033
OPENING.

19:03.033 --> 19:05.033
IS RAUL HERE TODAY?

19:05.033 --> 19:05.867
 HE WAS ASLEEP.

19:05.033 --> 19:05.867
AND I WANT ALL HANDS ON DECK TO

19:05.867 --> 19:08.733
HE KIND OF FORGOT.

19:05.867 --> 19:08.733
HE'S COMING RIGHT NOW.

19:08.733 --> 19:12.133
 EMPLOYEE TARDINESS COSTS

19:08.733 --> 19:12.133
BUSINESS THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

19:12.133 --> 19:14.433
EACH YEAR.

19:12.133 --> 19:14.433
NOT ONLY IS IT BAD BUSINESS,

19:14.433 --> 19:16.767
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN ON MY

19:14.433 --> 19:16.767
WATCH.

19:16.767 --> 19:19.300
I TALKED TO ERICK ABOUT RAUL...

19:16.767 --> 19:19.300
 MM-HMM.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.400
 WHO'S NOT HERE.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.400
 RIGHT.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.633
 PEOPLE CAN KIND OF NOT SHOW

19:21.400 --> 19:23.633
UP, AND THEY WOULD JUST KIND OF

19:23.633 --> 19:25.933
GET AWAY WITH IT?

19:23.633 --> 19:25.933
AS GENERAL MANAGER, MARINA NEEDS

19:25.933 --> 19:29.067
TO SET THE TONE.

19:25.933 --> 19:29.067
AND SHOWING UP FOR WORK LATE IS

19:29.067 --> 19:31.667
NOT ACCEPTABLE.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.667
AND HAVING THE EMPLOYEES RESPECT

19:31.667 --> 19:34.033
YOU IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN

19:31.667 --> 19:34.033
HAVING THEM LIKE YOU.

19:34.033 --> 19:35.433
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THIS THING

19:34.033 --> 19:35.433
COSTS?

19:35.433 --> 19:36.767
 OUR COST?

19:35.433 --> 19:36.767
 YEAH.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.200
 NO.

19:36.767 --> 19:38.200
 MARINA'S THE FIRST GENERAL

19:38.200 --> 19:40.767
MANAGER I'VE EVER MET THAT

19:38.200 --> 19:40.767
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND HER BUSINESS.

19:40.767 --> 19:42.600
DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR SALES PER

19:40.767 --> 19:42.600
SQUARE FOOT ARE?

19:42.600 --> 19:44.300
 NO.

19:42.600 --> 19:44.300
 HAVE YOU EVER EVEN THOUGHT

19:44.300 --> 19:45.633
ABOUT THAT?

19:44.300 --> 19:45.633
 NO.

19:45.633 --> 19:48.467
 HAVE YOU EVER EVEN HEARD THAT

19:45.633 --> 19:48.467
PHRASE?

19:48.467 --> 19:51.333
 NO. IS THAT BAD?

19:48.467 --> 19:51.333
 WHAT KIND OF GENERAL MANAGER

19:51.333 --> 19:55.800
IS THIS?

19:51.333 --> 19:55.800
THE THING THAT I REALLY WANT YOU

19:55.800 --> 19:59.333
TO DO IS BUILD A TEAM AROUND

19:55.800 --> 19:59.333
YOU.

19:59.333 --> 20:01.800
AND I'VE BEEN HERE A COUPLE

19:59.333 --> 20:01.800
DAYS.

20:01.800 --> 20:05.167
ONE THING THAT GLARES FOR ME IS

20:01.800 --> 20:05.167
THAT MARINA IS NOT YOUR GENERAL

20:05.167 --> 20:08.800
MANAGER.

20:05.167 --> 20:08.800
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE AFTER TODAY.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.733
THERE'S A NEED FOR A RETAIL

20:08.800 --> 20:11.733
MANAGER.

20:11.733 --> 20:13.233
THIS IS THE RIGHT JOB FOR

20:11.733 --> 20:13.233
MARINA.

20:13.233 --> 20:16.433
IT'S NOT FACILITY.

20:13.233 --> 20:16.433
IT'S NOT WORRYING ABOUT

20:16.433 --> 20:19.733
THE PRICING OR INVENTORY.

20:16.433 --> 20:19.733
IT'S JUST SELLING AND TAKING

20:19.733 --> 20:23.233
CARE OF CUSTOMERS.

20:19.733 --> 20:23.233
DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT?

20:23.233 --> 20:24.600
 YEAH.

20:23.233 --> 20:24.600
IT'S A HARD PROCESS.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.167
IT'S A LOT OF WORK.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.167
AND I'M NOT A REAL, UH,

20:27.167 --> 20:30.967
DISCIPLINARIAN, GET-IN-YOUR-FACE

20:27.167 --> 20:30.967
PERSON.

20:30.967 --> 20:33.567
 AND IF MARINA DOESN'T CUT IT

20:30.967 --> 20:33.567
IN THIS NEW ROLE, THEN

20:33.567 --> 20:35.800
UNFORTUNATELY SHE'S GONNA BE

20:33.567 --> 20:35.800
OUT.

20:35.800 --> 20:38.333
MARINA HAS NOT PROVEN TO ME

20:35.800 --> 20:38.333
SHE'S CAPABLE OF BEING A GENERAL

20:38.333 --> 20:40.367
MANAGER.

20:38.333 --> 20:40.367
HEY, MARINA, CAN HANK AND I

20:40.367 --> 20:41.967
BORROW YOU FOR A MINUTE?

20:40.367 --> 20:41.967
 YES.

20:41.967 --> 20:43.500
 OKAY.

20:41.967 --> 20:43.500
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE BASIC

20:43.500 --> 20:46.000
INVENTORY FUNCTIONS.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.000
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THE

20:46.000 --> 20:48.700
PROFIT AND LOSS STATEMENTS.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.700
SHE CAN'T BE A GENERAL MANAGER

20:48.700 --> 20:50.867
IN MY WORLD.

20:48.700 --> 20:50.867
IT'S IMPORTANT, HANK, THAT

20:50.867 --> 20:54.967
MARINA UNDERSTANDS FROM YOU WITH

20:50.867 --> 20:54.967
A MORE CLEAR JOB DESCRIPTION AND

20:54.967 --> 20:57.867
HOW HER WAGE IS GONNA TIE TO

20:54.967 --> 20:57.867
THAT.

20:57.867 --> 20:59.467
 I AGREE.

20:57.867 --> 20:59.467
 WHAT DO YOU WANT HER TO DO,

20:59.467 --> 21:01.533
LONG-TERM?

20:59.467 --> 21:01.533
 OKAY.

21:01.533 --> 21:03.667
SALES, WEDDINGS, PARTIES,

21:01.533 --> 21:03.667
WHATEVER.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.200
 ANYTHING THAT GOES THROUGH

21:03.667 --> 21:05.200
THE REGISTER, RIGHT?

21:05.200 --> 21:06.733
 RIGHT.

21:05.200 --> 21:06.733
 DOES SHE NEED TO MESS AROUND

21:06.733 --> 21:08.600
IN THE WAREHOUSE ANYMORE?

21:06.733 --> 21:08.600
 NO.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.000
 DOES SHE NEED TO BE IN

21:08.600 --> 21:10.000
THE PLANT DEPARTMENT?

21:10.000 --> 21:11.633
 NO.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.633
 DOES SHE NEED TO WORRY ABOUT

21:11.633 --> 21:13.133
IF THE AIR-CONDITIONING'S

21:11.633 --> 21:13.133
BROKEN?

21:13.133 --> 21:16.933
 NO.

21:13.133 --> 21:16.933
 ALL THAT STUFF, RELIEVED.

21:16.933 --> 21:19.700
HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

21:16.933 --> 21:19.700
 AM I COMPLETELY BEING

21:19.700 --> 21:23.633
WITHDRAWN FROM THE STAFF?

21:19.700 --> 21:23.633
'CAUSE USUALLY NOW THE EMPLOYEES

21:23.633 --> 21:26.567
WILL KIND OF REPORT TO ME, AND

21:23.633 --> 21:26.567
THEN, IF IT'S A BIGGER PROBLEM,

21:26.567 --> 21:29.467
I'LL GO TO HIM.

21:26.567 --> 21:29.467
SO IS THAT STILL GONNA HAPPEN?

21:29.467 --> 21:33.300
 I WOULD LIKE YOU TO STILL BE

21:29.467 --> 21:33.300
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT.

21:33.300 --> 21:34.800
 OKAY.

21:33.300 --> 21:34.800
 WELL, THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN

21:34.800 --> 21:36.733
WHAT WE TALKED ABOUT.

21:34.800 --> 21:36.733
HANK AND I HAD AN AGREEMENT

21:36.733 --> 21:39.800
THAT, WHEN MARINA CAME IN, HE

21:36.733 --> 21:39.800
WAS GONNA DEMOTE HER HIMSELF.

21:39.800 --> 21:42.200
BUT THE MINUTE MARINA CAME IN,

21:39.800 --> 21:42.200
HE CAVED.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.167
MARINA, LOOK.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.167
I DON'T THINK HANK IS MAKING

21:44.167 --> 21:46.567
THIS VERY CLEAR.

21:44.167 --> 21:46.567
AND IT'S HARD FOR HIM, BECAUSE

21:46.567 --> 21:49.067
HE HAS A LONGTIME RELATIONSHIP

21:46.567 --> 21:49.067
WITH YOU.

21:49.067 --> 21:52.500
FOR ME, THIS IS BUSINESS.

21:49.067 --> 21:52.500
AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE, YOU'RE

21:52.500 --> 21:57.633
BEING DEMOTED.

21:52.500 --> 21:57.633
YOU ARE NO LONGER THE GENERAL

21:57.633 --> 22:00.267
MANAGER.

21:57.633 --> 22:00.267
 WHY IS THAT?

22:00.267 --> 22:01.700
 I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE

22:00.267 --> 22:01.700
QUALIFIED.

22:01.700 --> 22:04.700
 WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL THAT WAY?

22:01.700 --> 22:04.700
 QUITE FRANKLY, I DON'T THINK

22:04.700 --> 22:07.667
THAT THE PEOPLE THAT WORK HERE

22:04.700 --> 22:07.667
HAVE ANY DISCIPLINE OR ANY

22:07.667 --> 22:09.600
STRUCTURE.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.600
AND AM I SUPPOSED TO BLAME HANK,

22:09.600 --> 22:12.267
OR AM I SUPPOSED TO BLAME YOU?

22:09.600 --> 22:12.267
YOU'RE THE GENERAL MANAGER.

22:12.267 --> 22:17.867
WHO DO YOU WANT ME TO BLAME?

22:12.267 --> 22:17.867
 THE BLAME WOULD BE ON ME.

22:17.867 --> 22:19.867
 WELL, THEN THAT'S WHY YOU'RE

22:17.867 --> 22:19.867
BEING DEMOTED.

22:19.867 --> 22:22.400
 I DON'T KNOW WHERE MARCUS IS

22:19.867 --> 22:22.400
COMING FROM.

22:22.400 --> 22:25.767
HE DOESN'T KNOW EVERYTHING THAT

22:22.400 --> 22:25.767
I DO IN THE STORE.

22:25.767 --> 22:28.667
I WORK HARD EVERYWHERE THAT I'VE

22:25.767 --> 22:28.667
BEEN.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.900
AND THAT'S HOW I'VE BEEN TAUGHT.

22:28.667 --> 22:30.900
THAT'S HOW I'VE BEEN RAISED.

22:30.900 --> 22:32.667
BUT HANK JUST DOESN'T TAKE

22:33.867 --> 22:41.267
AND THAT ADDS A LOT OF PRESSURE.

22:36.033 --> 22:41.267
[sobs]

22:45.233 --> 22:47.100
 I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

22:45.233 --> 22:47.100
WE'RE CLEAR, OKAY?

22:47.100 --> 22:52.367
 ALL RIGHT.

22:47.100 --> 22:52.367
 COMING UP...

22:52.367 --> 22:55.367
THE NEW VAN, CHECK IT OUT.

22:52.367 --> 22:55.367
 UNBELIEVABLE.

22:55.367 --> 22:57.333
 VERY ELEGANT.

22:55.367 --> 22:57.333
 IT'S EASY TO BUY THIS ONLINE

22:57.333 --> 23:01.367
OR WHEREVER AND JUST SLAP IT ON

22:57.333 --> 23:01.367
A TRUCK.

23:01.367 --> 23:02.233
 AND LATER...

23:04.767 --> 23:07.667
ASS BACK HERE, AND BE A LEADER

23:05.767 --> 23:07.667
RIGHT NOW.

23:18.500 --> 23:22.667
 WHEN HANK AND MARCUS DEMOTED

23:18.500 --> 23:22.667
ME, IT WAS HARD, BUT HE'S THE

23:22.667 --> 23:25.833
BUSINESS EXPERT, AND, YOU KNOW,

23:22.667 --> 23:25.833
I STILL WANT TO DO EVERYTHING

23:25.833 --> 23:30.367
IN MY POWER TO KEEP, YOU KNOW,

23:25.833 --> 23:30.367
THE FAMILY BUSINESS GOING.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.067
 I WANT YOU TO SEE THE LINES

23:30.367 --> 23:33.067
OF SIGHT, OKAY?

23:33.067 --> 23:34.633
 RIGHT.

23:33.067 --> 23:34.633
 AND WE WANT TO HAVE CLEAR

23:34.633 --> 23:37.467
LINES OF SIGHT, SO WHEN THE

23:34.633 --> 23:37.467
CUSTOMER COMES IN, IT'S

23:37.467 --> 23:39.533
INVITING.

23:37.467 --> 23:39.533
IF THERE'S ONE THING I KNOW

23:39.533 --> 23:41.633
ABOUT A BUSINESS, APPEARANCE

23:39.533 --> 23:41.633
MATTERS.

23:41.633 --> 23:43.900
SO I'M GONNA REORGANIZE THE

23:41.633 --> 23:43.900
STORE AND CHANGE THE LAYOUT,

23:43.900 --> 23:46.067
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY WAY

23:43.900 --> 23:46.067
WE'RE GONNA MAKE MONEY.

23:46.067 --> 23:49.133
WE HAVE EVERYTHING HERE FROM

23:46.067 --> 23:49.133
VASES TO LAMPS TO FLOWERS TO

23:49.133 --> 23:52.767
FURNITURE TO CANDLES TO

23:49.133 --> 23:52.767
WALLPAPER TO GREETING CARDS.

23:52.767 --> 23:54.400
 OKAY.

23:52.767 --> 23:54.400
 ALL I'M THINKING ABOUT IS

23:54.400 --> 23:57.667
CUSTOMER FLOW AND EASE OF ACCESS

23:54.400 --> 23:57.667
TO PRODUCT.

23:57.667 --> 23:59.500
THE FIRST IMPRESSION IN THE

23:57.667 --> 23:59.500
BUSINESS IS THE ONLY IMPRESSION

23:59.500 --> 24:01.300
THAT MATTERS.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.300
SO I'M BRINGING IN SOME

24:01.300 --> 24:04.200
DESIGNERS TO HELP ME REORGANIZE

24:01.300 --> 24:04.200
THE STORE AND RE-MERCHANDISE IT.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.933
IF THE CUSTOMERS CAN FIND THE

24:04.200 --> 24:06.933
INVENTORY, THEY CAN BUY IT.

24:06.933 --> 24:14.500
AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL MAKE MONEY.

24:06.933 --> 24:14.500
THERE ARE WORKERS EVERYWHERE

24:14.500 --> 24:16.333
AROUND HERE.

24:14.500 --> 24:16.333
ELECTRICIANS...

24:16.333 --> 24:17.767
 I'M GOING TO GET YOU LIGHT

24:16.333 --> 24:17.767
FIXTURES.

24:17.767 --> 24:19.267
 OKAY.

24:17.767 --> 24:19.267
I'M LOOKING FOR THIS THING TO BE

24:19.267 --> 24:21.500
AS BRIGHT AS DAY.

24:19.267 --> 24:21.500
NOT ONLY IS THIS BUILDING OLD,

24:21.500 --> 24:24.433
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN MAINTAINED IN

24:21.500 --> 24:24.433
YEARS.

24:24.433 --> 24:29.100
I'M REPLACING FIXTURES, WIRING,

24:24.433 --> 24:29.100
EVERYTHING YOU CAN THINK OF.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.500
WE ARE INSTALLING SECURITY

24:29.100 --> 24:31.500
CAMERAS, SO I'LL BE ABLE TO

24:31.500 --> 24:35.100
LITERALLY, ON MY PHONE, CLICK

24:31.500 --> 24:35.100
SOMETHING AND SEE ALL THE

24:35.100 --> 24:38.100
DIFFERENT CAMERAS.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.100
THE SECURITY CAMERAS ARE GONNA

24:38.100 --> 24:36.633
BUSY AND WHICH ONES AREN'T AND

24:38.100 --> 24:36.633
THE TRAFFIC PATTERNS OF THE

24:36.633 --> 24:41.467
TELL ME WHAT DEPARTMENTS ARE

24:36.633 --> 24:41.467
CUSTOMERS.

24:41.467 --> 24:45.233
I ALSO ORDERED GPSs FOR ALL

24:41.467 --> 24:45.233
THE VEHICLES.

24:45.233 --> 24:47.767
I'VE PUT A NEW INVENTORY SYSTEM

24:45.233 --> 24:47.767
IN PLACE, SO I KNOW WHERE ALL

24:47.767 --> 24:50.067
THE INVENTORY IS.

24:47.767 --> 24:50.067
ALL OF IT'S INPUT, AND NOW WE'RE

24:50.067 --> 24:52.100
IN THE RIGHT CENTURY.

24:50.067 --> 24:52.100
I'M REPLACING THE FILTHY

24:52.100 --> 24:54.100
FLOORING WITH FRESH, NEW

24:52.100 --> 24:54.100
CARPETING.

24:54.100 --> 24:57.567
WE'RE REPLACING THE ABSOLUTELY

24:54.100 --> 24:57.567
RIDICULOUS PLASTIC WINDOWS WITH

24:57.567 --> 25:00.267
GLASS.

24:57.567 --> 25:00.267
WE'RE ALSO DE-CLUTTERING THE

25:00.267 --> 25:03.267
INVENTORY BY MOVING THINGS INTO

25:00.267 --> 25:03.267
A BRAND-NEW SALE SECTION IN THE

25:03.267 --> 25:05.500
WAREHOUSE.

25:03.267 --> 25:05.500
WE'RE GONNA TURN THIS INVENTORY,

25:05.500 --> 25:07.967
AND WE'RE GONNA FREE UP OUR

25:05.500 --> 25:07.967
CASH.

25:07.967 --> 25:11.667
THAT FIXTURE, THIS FIXTURE, THIS

25:07.967 --> 25:11.667
FIXTURE, AND THIS FIXTURE ALL GO

25:11.667 --> 25:14.300
INTO THE WAREHOUSE.

25:11.667 --> 25:14.300
 MARCUS TOOK A LOT OF STUFF

25:14.300 --> 25:16.867
OUT OF THE STORE AND JUST KIND

25:14.300 --> 25:16.867
OF DUMPED IT IN THE GARAGE.

25:16.867 --> 25:18.567
THIS DOESN'T SEEM LIKE A GREAT

25:16.867 --> 25:18.567
PLAN AT ALL.

25:18.567 --> 25:20.433
I MEAN, I COULD'VE TAKEN ALL THE

25:18.567 --> 25:20.433
STUFF OUT OF THE STORE AND JUST

25:20.433 --> 25:23.067
PUT IT IN THE GARAGE AND THEN

25:20.433 --> 25:23.067
CALLED IT A DAY, SO I'M NOT SURE

25:23.067 --> 25:27.167
WHAT WE'RE DOING OR WHAT HIS

25:23.067 --> 25:27.167
IDEA IS.

25:27.167 --> 25:30.500
 HEY, I SEE YOU GUYS.

25:27.167 --> 25:30.500
ONE OF MY IDEAS IS TO MAKE SURE

25:30.500 --> 25:33.067
THAT, WHEN THE CUSTOMER COMES

25:30.500 --> 25:33.067
IN, THEY CAN SEE ALL THE FLORAL

25:33.067 --> 25:35.267
DESIGNERS ALONG THE LEFT-HAND

25:33.067 --> 25:35.267
SIDE.

25:35.267 --> 25:36.833
WHAT DO YOU THINK, DAVID?

25:35.267 --> 25:36.833
BETTER?

25:36.833 --> 25:38.200
 GOOD.

25:36.833 --> 25:38.200
I DEFINITELY THINK THE CHANGES

25:38.200 --> 25:40.467
ARE FOR THE BETTER.

25:38.200 --> 25:40.467
IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME COMING.

25:40.467 --> 25:44.400
I AM VERY HAPPY.

25:40.467 --> 25:44.400
 WE'LL GO RIGHT TO THE

25:44.400 --> 25:46.033
GARBAGE.

25:44.400 --> 25:46.033
 IS THERE A WAY--'CAUSE WE'VE

25:46.033 --> 25:48.433
TALKED ABOUT THIS--TO, LIKE,

25:46.033 --> 25:48.433
FROST THAT WINDOW?

25:48.433 --> 25:50.533
SO THAT WAY YOU CAN'T SEE.

25:48.433 --> 25:50.533
 YEAH.

25:50.533 --> 25:53.033
 'CAUSE IT LOOKS REAL--I MEAN,

25:50.533 --> 25:53.033
THE FLOORS DO LOOK TRASHY WHEN

25:53.033 --> 25:54.933
YOU'RE WALKING THAT WAY,

25:53.033 --> 25:54.933
ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE THROWING--

25:54.933 --> 25:56.500
 YOU'RE SAYING ALL THE WAY

25:54.933 --> 25:56.500
DOWN?

25:56.500 --> 25:58.267
 YEAH.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.267
 I LIKE THAT IDEA.

25:58.267 --> 26:00.867
GREAT JOB.

25:58.267 --> 26:00.867
REALLY GREAT JOB.

26:00.867 --> 26:02.667
LET'S START WORKING ON THAT.

26:00.867 --> 26:02.667
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT HOW MARINA

26:02.667 --> 26:05.367
WAS GONNA HANDLE HER DEMOTION.

26:02.667 --> 26:05.367
BUT I HAVE TO TELL YOU, I'M

26:05.367 --> 26:08.333
PLEASANTLY SURPRISED.

26:05.367 --> 26:08.333
SHE SEEMS VERY COMMITTED, WHICH

26:08.333 --> 26:11.333
PROVES TO ME THAT SHE CARES

26:08.333 --> 26:11.333
ABOUT THIS COMPANY.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.100
 THIS IS REALLY, REALLY NICE.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.100
I THINK NOW YOU KNOW YOU'RE IN A

26:13.100 --> 26:14.900
FLOWER SHOP.

26:13.100 --> 26:14.900
 OKAY.

26:14.900 --> 26:17.033
I FEEL REALLY GOOD ABOUT THE

26:14.900 --> 26:17.033
PROGRESS THESE TEAM MEMBERS ARE

26:17.033 --> 26:18.767
MAKING.

26:17.033 --> 26:18.767
AND THE VIBE IN THIS BUILDING IS

26:18.767 --> 26:22.167
THE BEST IT'S EVER BEEN.

26:18.767 --> 26:22.167
 GOOD.

26:22.167 --> 26:24.233
 WE'LL GET THESE TABLES SET UP

26:22.167 --> 26:24.233
SO THAT TOMORROW MORNING, WHEN

26:24.233 --> 26:27.700
THE FRESH-CUT STUFF COMES OUT,

26:24.233 --> 26:27.700
THIS POWER AISLE WILL HAVE THE

26:27.700 --> 26:30.500
RIGHT STUFF HERE.

26:27.700 --> 26:30.500
SO I THINK WE'RE GOOD.

26:30.500 --> 26:33.667
 I'M NOT SURE THAT THE STORE

26:30.500 --> 26:33.667
LOOKS THAT MUCH BETTER.

26:33.667 --> 26:38.567
SO MY CONFIDENCE IN MARCUS RIGHT

26:33.667 --> 26:38.567
NOW IS KIND OF WISHY-WASHY.

26:38.567 --> 26:40.833
 OKAY?

26:38.567 --> 26:40.833
 ALL RIGHT. [clears throat]

26:40.833 --> 26:43.767
 YES? NO?

26:40.833 --> 26:43.767
 WELL, WHEN THE STORE OPENS, I

26:43.767 --> 26:49.033
DON'T WANT IT TO LOOK LIKE WE'RE

26:43.767 --> 26:49.033
GOING OUT OF BUSINESS OR--

26:49.033 --> 26:51.667
 OR RENOVATING STUFF?

26:49.033 --> 26:51.667
 OR SOMEBODY CAME IN AND STOLE

26:51.667 --> 26:55.933
THE TABLES THAT THE ARRANGEMENTS

26:51.667 --> 26:55.933
GO ON.

26:55.933 --> 26:59.600
 HANK, WHY DON'T WE GO JUST

26:55.933 --> 26:59.600
CHAT?

26:59.600 --> 27:02.600
MAARSE HAS OVER $400,000 OF

26:59.600 --> 27:02.600
INVENTORY, AND OVER HALF OF IT

27:02.600 --> 27:05.600
HAS BEEN HERE FOR YEARS.

27:02.600 --> 27:05.600
WE NEED TO LIQUIDATE THE BAD

27:05.600 --> 27:08.500
STUFF AND REINVEST THAT CASH

27:05.600 --> 27:08.500
EITHER IN PAYING OFF OUR DEBT OR

27:08.500 --> 27:11.667
BUYING INVENTORY THAT SELLS.

27:08.500 --> 27:11.667
YOU'RE TIRED.

27:11.667 --> 27:13.400
IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY.

27:11.667 --> 27:13.400
YOU'RE FRUSTRATED.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.733
YOU'RE SEEING ALL YOUR CASH

27:13.400 --> 27:15.733
SITTING OUT HERE, AND YOU'RE

27:15.733 --> 27:18.300
THINKING TO YOURSELF, "THIS GUY

27:15.733 --> 27:18.300
CAME IN HERE, HE TOOK ALL THE

27:18.300 --> 27:20.933
[bleep] OUT OF MY STORE, AND

27:18.300 --> 27:20.933
HE'S ACTING LIKE IT'S NOT WORTH

27:20.933 --> 27:23.600
ANYTHING."

27:20.933 --> 27:23.600
AM I PRETTY CLOSE?

27:23.600 --> 27:26.267
 WELL, YOU TOOK IT ALL OUT.

27:23.600 --> 27:26.267
AND NOW IT'S IN THE GARAGE.

27:26.267 --> 27:28.633
AND NOW WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

27:26.267 --> 27:28.633
THIS IS ALL THE NEW STUFF.

27:28.633 --> 27:31.467
HOW LONG IS THIS GONNA SIT HERE?

27:28.633 --> 27:31.467
OR ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME WHAT TO

27:31.467 --> 27:33.000
DO WITH IT?

27:31.467 --> 27:33.000
 DON'T GET FRUSTRATED.

27:33.000 --> 27:35.400
BUT WHEN YOU SAY TO ME,

27:33.000 --> 27:35.400
"EVERYTHING'S NEW--"

27:35.400 --> 27:37.767
 90% OF THAT CART IS NEW,

27:35.400 --> 27:37.767
YEAH.

27:37.767 --> 27:40.200
 HOW ABOUT THAT CART?

27:37.767 --> 27:40.200
90% OF THAT CART?

27:40.200 --> 27:43.633
 WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

27:40.200 --> 27:43.633
LUGGAGES AND THIS, EVERYTHING

27:43.633 --> 27:46.167
ELSE IS NEW.

27:43.633 --> 27:46.167
OH, AND THOSE LAMPS.

27:46.167 --> 27:48.133
 THE PAINTINGS ARE NEW.

27:46.167 --> 27:48.133
THE METAL'S NEW.

27:48.133 --> 27:51.500
 I GOT TO TELL YOU GUYS, YOU

27:48.133 --> 27:51.500
HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT YOUR

27:51.500 --> 27:53.533
INVENTORY.

27:51.500 --> 27:53.533
 YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T CLEAR

27:53.533 --> 27:56.767
THE FACT THAT THIS PILE OF STUFF

27:53.533 --> 27:56.767
IS SITTING HERE, AND WE STILL

27:56.767 --> 27:58.433
DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

27:56.767 --> 27:58.433
WITH IT.

27:58.433 --> 28:00.967
 HANK HAS NO IDEA HOW MUCH

27:58.433 --> 28:00.967
MERCHANDISE HE HAS.

28:00.967 --> 28:03.533
SITTING ON DEAD INVENTORY WILL

28:00.967 --> 28:03.533
LEAD TO BANKRUPTCY.

28:03.533 --> 28:05.600
IF WE WANT TO AVOID THAT, WE'D

28:03.533 --> 28:05.600
BETTER GET RID OF THE STUFF THAT

28:05.600 --> 28:08.567
DOESN'T SELL.

28:05.600 --> 28:08.567
IT'S GOT TO GO NOW.

28:08.567 --> 28:10.433
I WANT TO MAKE IT EASY.

28:08.567 --> 28:10.433
IS THIS NEW?

28:10.433 --> 28:16.567
 NO.

28:10.433 --> 28:16.567
 WHAT ELSE?

28:16.567 --> 28:18.233
COMING UP...

28:16.567 --> 28:18.233
 SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, SINCE

28:18.233 --> 28:20.400
YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE?

28:18.233 --> 28:20.400
 REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

28:20.400 --> 28:21.867
 SO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE COMING

28:20.400 --> 28:21.867
BACK?

28:21.867 --> 28:23.200
 OH, YEAH.

28:21.867 --> 28:23.200
 AND LATER...

28:23.200 --> 28:24.800
 NO, I'M NOT [bleep] KIDDING.

28:23.200 --> 28:24.800
 YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO TELL ME

28:24.800 --> 28:26.267
THAT I DIDN'T PUT MONEY IN YOUR

28:24.800 --> 28:26.267
BUSINESS?

28:26.267 --> 28:29.667
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID.

28:27.033 --> 28:29.667
 YOU BETTER CALL YOUR MAMA AND

28:27.767 --> 28:29.667
GET MY MONEY BACK.

28:38.567 --> 28:40.800
 YOU KNOW, HANK'S NOT TOTALLY

28:38.567 --> 28:40.800
COMFORTABLE WITH ALL THE CHANGES

28:40.800 --> 28:43.000
THAT I'M MAKING, BUT HE WILL BE

28:40.800 --> 28:43.000
WHEN HE SEES HIS BOTTOM LINE IN

28:43.000 --> 28:45.233
A COUPLE MONTHS.

28:43.000 --> 28:45.233
I'M GONNA TAKE HIM TO THE FLOWER

28:45.233 --> 28:52.967
MART, AND I'M GONNA SHOW HIM HOW

28:45.233 --> 28:52.967
EASY IT IS TO MAKE MORE MONEY.

28:52.967 --> 28:53.733
IF YOU'RE GONNA MAKE MONEY IN

28:54.833 --> 28:57.867
SELL IT FOR, BUT IT'S ALSO WHAT

28:55.967 --> 28:57.867
YOU BUY IT FOR.

29:04.067 --> 29:08.567
CREDIT CARD?

29:04.067 --> 29:08.567
IF HANK TAKES MY ADVICE AND

29:08.567 --> 29:12.033
TAKES CASH TO THE FLOWER MART,

29:08.567 --> 29:12.033
I THINK HE CAN PICK UP 10 TO

29:12.033 --> 29:14.967
15 POINTS OF MARGIN ON WHAT

29:12.033 --> 29:14.967
HE BUYS.

29:14.967 --> 29:17.367
WELL, MAARSE BUYS $1 MILLION

29:14.967 --> 29:17.367
A YEAR IN FLOWERS.

29:17.367 --> 29:20.267
SO JUST WITH THAT SIMPLE ADVICE,

29:17.367 --> 29:20.267
I THINK HE COULD PICK UP

29:20.267 --> 29:26.867
$100,000 TO $150,000 IN PROFIT.

29:20.267 --> 29:26.867
70% OF SECOND-GENERATION

29:26.867 --> 29:30.000
BUSINESSES FAIL IN THIS COUNTRY.

29:26.867 --> 29:30.000
I NEED TO FIGURE OUT IF HANK

29:30.000 --> 29:32.300
REALLY IS COMMITTED TO THIS

29:30.000 --> 29:32.300
BUSINESS AND IF HE REALLY WANTS

29:32.300 --> 29:34.500
TO BE IN IT.

29:32.300 --> 29:34.500
EARLY INDICATIONS TELL ME THAT

29:34.500 --> 29:36.567
HE DOESN'T.

29:34.500 --> 29:36.567
TELL ME HOW YOU THINK YOU DID

29:36.567 --> 29:38.900
BEFORE WE GOT HERE.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.900
 AS FAR AS?

29:38.900 --> 29:42.100
 AS A BUSINESS OWNER.

29:38.900 --> 29:42.100
 I MEAN, TO BE HONEST, BETWEEN

29:42.100 --> 29:47.333
YOU AND ME, I'VE FELT TERRIBLE

29:42.100 --> 29:47.333
FOR THE LAST, I DON'T KNOW--

29:47.333 --> 29:50.233
 COUPLE YEARS?

29:47.333 --> 29:50.233
 AT LEAST, YEAH.

29:50.233 --> 29:53.400
 WELL, YOU GOT TO BE A LITTLE

29:50.233 --> 29:53.400
SICK OF IT.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.533
 YEAH, COMPLETELY.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.533
 I MEAN, THE STUFF THAT WE'RE

29:55.533 --> 29:57.567
DOING, THE 100,000 THAT'S BEEN

29:55.533 --> 29:57.567
SPENT--

29:57.567 --> 29:59.433
 I THINK YOU'VE SPENT MORE

29:57.567 --> 29:59.433
THAN THAT.

29:59.433 --> 30:00.867
 HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK I'VE

29:59.433 --> 30:00.867
SPENT?

30:00.867 --> 30:04.667
 I THINK YOU'VE PROBABLY

30:00.867 --> 30:04.667
SPENT, LIKE, 150,000.

30:04.667 --> 30:06.033
 NOW LET ME ASK YOU

30:04.667 --> 30:06.033
A QUESTION.

30:06.033 --> 30:08.867
HAVE I COME BACK TO YOU AND

30:06.033 --> 30:08.867
ASKED YOU FOR ANYTHING FOR IT?

30:08.867 --> 30:10.500
 NO.

30:08.867 --> 30:10.500
 AND HAVE I EVEN BROUGHT IT

30:10.500 --> 30:12.233
UP?

30:10.500 --> 30:12.233
 NO.

30:12.233 --> 30:13.933
 WHY?

30:12.233 --> 30:13.933
 'CAUSE YOU BELIEVE IN THE

30:13.933 --> 30:16.600
BUSINESS.

30:13.933 --> 30:16.600
 THAT'S EXACTLY WHY.

30:16.600 --> 30:18.800
THE BUSINESS HAS A TON OF

30:16.600 --> 30:18.800
POTENTIAL.

30:18.800 --> 30:21.100
I THINK THE WORRY I HAVE, AND I

30:18.800 --> 30:21.100
DIDN'T TELL THIS TO ANYBODY

30:21.100 --> 30:24.300
ELSE, IS THAT I DON'T THINK YOU

30:21.100 --> 30:24.300
WANT TO DO IT ANYMORE.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.833
YOU'RE A REALLY GOOD GUY.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.833
BUT YOU ARE A REALLY, REALLY

30:26.833 --> 30:31.067
[bleep] BUSINESSPERSON.

30:26.833 --> 30:31.067
 [laughs]

30:31.067 --> 30:33.467
WELL, I HOPE YOU'RE NOT GONNA

30:31.067 --> 30:33.467
PUT IT LIKE THAT.

30:33.467 --> 30:37.133
 DO YOU AGREE WITH IT?

30:33.467 --> 30:37.133
 I DON'T KNOW IF I'M A REAL

30:37.133 --> 30:43.667
[bleep] BUSINESSPERSON.

30:37.133 --> 30:43.667
 ARE YOU GOOD?

30:43.667 --> 30:46.767
 I THINK I'M PRETTY GOOD.

30:43.667 --> 30:46.767
 I'M SENSING THAT THE WEIGHT

30:46.767 --> 30:50.033
OF HIS FATHER'S SUCCESS IS

30:46.767 --> 30:50.033
A LITTLE TOO MUCH FOR HANK TO

30:50.033 --> 30:51.833
HANDLE.

30:50.033 --> 30:51.833
 I MEAN, YOU KNOW I'M GONNA

30:51.833 --> 30:54.800
MAKE MONEY EVENTUALLY.

30:51.833 --> 30:54.800
IT MAY TAKE YOU 30 YEARS TO GET

30:54.800 --> 30:56.733
BACK YOUR INVESTMENT, BUT YOU

30:54.800 --> 30:56.733
KNOW I'M GONNA MAKE MONEY

30:56.733 --> 30:58.600
EVENTUALLY.

30:56.733 --> 30:58.600
 DID YOU ACTUALLY JUST TELL ME

30:58.600 --> 31:02.300
THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE 30 YEARS?

30:58.600 --> 31:02.300
 [laughs]

31:02.300 --> 31:11.000
 OH, MY GOD.

31:02.300 --> 31:11.000
AS I LOOK AT THESE VANS, I CAN'T

31:11.000 --> 31:13.567
UNDERSTAND WHY HANK DOESN'T HAVE

31:11.000 --> 31:13.567
THE PHONE NUMBER ON THEM.

31:13.567 --> 31:16.367
SO I ENDED UP WRAPPING ALL THE

31:13.567 --> 31:16.367
VANS WITH NOT ONLY NEW ARTWORK,

31:16.367 --> 31:18.933
BUT THE ACTUAL PHONE NUMBER AND

31:16.367 --> 31:18.933
WEBSITE.

31:18.933 --> 31:22.333
THE NEW VAN, CHECK IT OUT.

31:18.933 --> 31:22.333
 UNBELIEVABLE.

31:22.333 --> 31:25.600
I LOVE THE WAY IT'S GOING AROUND

31:22.333 --> 31:25.600
THE WHOLE BOTTOM OF THE TRUCK.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.933
IT'S VERY CLASSY.

31:25.600 --> 31:26.933
 WOW.

31:26.933 --> 31:29.333
 YEAH, IT'S FANTASTIC.

31:26.933 --> 31:29.333
AND THE TELEPHONE NUMBER'S ON

31:29.333 --> 31:31.700
THERE.

31:29.333 --> 31:31.700
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

31:31.700 --> 31:33.700
 YOU ARE?

31:31.700 --> 31:33.700
 I LIKE THIS LOOK SPECIFICALLY

31:33.700 --> 31:37.000
'CAUSE IT'S NEW, AND IT'S

31:33.700 --> 31:37.000
DIFFERENT, AND IT'S CONTRASTING.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.233
 I THINK IT'S AWESOME.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.233
IT'S VERY VIBRANT.

31:39.233 --> 31:42.467
EYE-CATCHING, VERY ELEGANT.

31:39.233 --> 31:42.467
 INSTEAD OF THE DECAL BEING A

31:42.467 --> 31:46.867
PHOTOGRAPH, I WOULD'VE DONE IT

31:42.467 --> 31:46.867
IN A PAINTING INSTEAD, 'CAUSE

31:46.867 --> 31:51.500
IT'S EASY TO BUY THIS ONLINE OR

31:46.867 --> 31:51.500
WHEREVER AND JUST SLAP IT ON

31:51.500 --> 31:55.000
THE TRUCK.

31:51.500 --> 31:55.000
 WE HAVE A GRAND OPENING

31:55.000 --> 31:59.000
TODAY.

31:56.000 --> 31:59.000
AND ALL I'M GETTING FROM HANK IS

31:57.100 --> 31:59.000
DISSENTION.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.333
ALL THIS HARD WORK'S FINALLY

32:11.000 --> 32:13.333
COMING TO AN END.

32:13.333 --> 32:15.767
I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE RE-GRAND

32:13.333 --> 32:15.767
OPENING.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.600
 IT'S GOOD HAVING MARCUS

32:15.767 --> 32:17.600
AROUND.

32:17.600 --> 32:20.733
HE'S JUST GOT ENERGY AND IDEAS,

32:17.600 --> 32:20.733
AND THEY BOUNCE OFF THE ROOM.

32:20.733 --> 32:22.867
AND EVERYBODY GETS EXCITED.

32:20.733 --> 32:22.867
"WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO NEXT?"

32:22.867 --> 32:31.867
AND I LOVE ALL THE CHANGES.

32:22.867 --> 32:31.867
 I THINK HIM COMING HERE HAS

32:31.867 --> 32:30.567
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

32:31.867 --> 32:30.567
AND I THINK IT'S WHAT IT'S

32:30.567 --> 32:38.200
BEEN ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC.

32:30.567 --> 32:38.200
 WHOO-HOO.

32:38.200 --> 32:41.467
 I LOVE THE WINDOWS WITH THE

32:38.200 --> 32:41.467
PICTURES OF ROSES ON THEM.

32:41.467 --> 32:43.800
AND I LIKE THINGS NOT BEING IN

32:41.467 --> 32:43.800
FRONT OF ME SO THAT I FEEL

32:43.800 --> 32:47.000
INCLUDED WITH ALL OF THE OTHER

32:43.800 --> 32:47.000
DESIGNERS.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.700
 TELL PEOPLE TO COME IN HERE.

32:47.000 --> 32:48.700
 OKAY.

32:48.700 --> 32:50.600
 AND TELL THEM WE'RE HAVING A

32:48.700 --> 32:50.600
RE-GRAND OPENING.

32:50.600 --> 32:33.333
 OKAY.

32:50.600 --> 32:33.333
 QUICKLY.

32:33.333 --> 32:53.233
NEEDED FOR A LONG, LONG TIME.

32:33.333 --> 32:53.233
BE BACK IN, LIKE, TEN MINUTES AT

32:53.233 --> 32:57.167
MOST.

32:53.233 --> 32:57.167
RUN.

32:57.167 --> 32:59.267
 WE'RE JUST DOING A RE-GRAND

32:57.167 --> 32:59.267
OPENING.

32:59.267 --> 33:03.133
I'VE INVESTED CLOSE TO $150,000

32:59.267 --> 33:03.133
SO FAR TO FIX THIS BUSINESS.

33:03.133 --> 33:06.267
WE'VE MADE OVER THE WHOLE STORE.

33:03.133 --> 33:06.267
AND I'M HAVING A RE-GRAND

33:06.267 --> 33:08.733
OPENING TODAY, SO THAT I CAN

33:06.267 --> 33:08.733
HAVE THE CUSTOMERS ACTUALLY

33:08.733 --> 33:11.300
TEST-DRIVE THE NEW PROCESS AND

33:08.733 --> 33:11.300
THE NEW PRODUCT AND TELL ME IF

33:11.300 --> 33:13.633
THEY LIKE IT.

33:11.300 --> 33:13.633
 HAVE A GREAT WEEKEND.

33:13.633 --> 33:15.700
 THANK YOU.

33:13.633 --> 33:15.700
 THE DECOR INSIDE HAS CHANGED

33:15.700 --> 33:17.800
A LOT.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.800
I LOVE SHOPPING HERE.

33:17.800 --> 33:20.933
[laughs]

33:17.800 --> 33:20.933
 THE STORE IS DEFINITELY

33:20.933 --> 33:22.267
INVITING.

33:20.933 --> 33:22.267
I NOTICED A LOT MORE

33:22.267 --> 33:24.900
PRE-ARRANGED FLOWERS TO CHOOSE

33:22.267 --> 33:24.900
FROM.

33:24.900 --> 33:30.433
THEY HAD A GREAT VARIETY TODAY.

33:24.900 --> 33:30.433
 SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, SINCE

33:30.433 --> 33:32.433
YOU'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE?

33:30.433 --> 33:32.433
 REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

33:32.433 --> 33:34.467
 NO, IT FEELS GOOD, YEAH.

33:32.433 --> 33:34.467
 SO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE COMING

33:34.467 --> 33:35.800
BACK?

33:34.467 --> 33:35.800
 OH, YEAH.

33:35.800 --> 33:39.367
 IN A TYPICAL YEAR, MAARSE

33:35.800 --> 33:39.367
AVERAGES ABOUT $10,000 A DAY.

33:39.367 --> 33:43.167
SO FAR, THIS BUSINESS HAS DONE

33:39.367 --> 33:43.167
$13,000 TODAY.

33:43.167 --> 33:46.100
THAT'S ALMOST A 30% INCREASE IN

33:43.167 --> 33:46.100
BUSINESS.

33:46.100 --> 33:49.800
I'M HAPPY WITH THE PROGRESS.

33:46.100 --> 33:49.800
AND THERE'S A CLEAR STANDOUT.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.800
MARINA'S DOING A GREAT JOB.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.800
 AND I THINK IT'S TERRIFIC.

33:52.800 --> 33:54.200
 YOU DO?

33:52.800 --> 33:54.200
 I DO. IT'S BRIGHT.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.533
 RIGHT.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.533
 IT'S CHEERFUL.

33:55.533 --> 33:58.233
 SHE'S REALLY TAKING THIS

33:55.533 --> 33:58.233
LEADERSHIP ROLE SERIOUSLY.

33:58.233 --> 33:59.800
SHE'S INTERACTING WITH

33:58.233 --> 33:59.800
CUSTOMERS.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.200
 THANKS FOR COMING IN.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.200
 YOU'RE WELCOME.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.633
 TAKE CARE.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.633
 SHE'S DOING ALL THE THINGS

34:02.633 --> 34:05.067
THAT, QUITE FRANKLY, HANK SHOULD

34:02.633 --> 34:05.067
BE DOING.

34:05.067 --> 34:08.567
HAVE YOU SEEN HANK?

34:05.067 --> 34:08.567
 I SAW HANK NOT TOO LONG AGO.

34:08.567 --> 34:12.632
 A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS OWNER

34:08.567 --> 34:12.632
SUBSCRIBES TO ONE THEORY.

34:12.632 --> 34:15.567
THEY SHOW UP FIRST, AND THEY

34:12.632 --> 34:15.567
LEAVE LAST.

34:15.567 --> 34:17.367
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HANK IS?

34:15.567 --> 34:17.367
 I DON'T KNOW.

34:17.367 --> 34:20.433
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S GONE HOME

34:17.367 --> 34:20.433
OR WHAT.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.667
 I CANNOT BELIEVE HE LEFT.

34:20.433 --> 34:23.667
NOT ONLY IS IT DISRESPECTFUL TO

34:23.667 --> 34:26.533
THE EMPLOYEES, IT'S

34:23.667 --> 34:26.533
DISRESPECTFUL TO ALL THE

34:26.533 --> 34:29.033
CUSTOMERS WHO ARE COMING HERE

34:26.533 --> 34:29.033
TODAY.

34:29.033 --> 34:33.067
HE REALLY LEFT?

34:29.033 --> 34:33.067
LIKE, HE'S GONE?

34:33.067 --> 34:41.300
 AS FAR AS I KNOW.

34:33.067 --> 34:41.300
 HE LITERALLY DISAPPEARED.

34:41.300 --> 34:43.699
OH, HEY, HANK.

34:41.300 --> 34:43.699
WHERE'D YOU GO, BUDDY?

34:43.699 --> 34:37.100
WE HAVE A GRAND OPENING.

34:43.699 --> 34:37.100
HANK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

34:37.100 --> 34:51.933
I'M PISSED.

34:37.100 --> 34:51.933
YOU LEFT.

34:51.933 --> 34:54.367
THIS IS [bleep] RIDICULOUS.

34:51.933 --> 34:54.367
YOU NEED TO [bleep] COME BACK

34:54.367 --> 34:55.766
HERE.

34:54.367 --> 34:55.766
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR A WEEK.

34:55.766 --> 34:57.700
I'M DOING ALL THIS STUFF.

34:55.766 --> 34:57.700
THIS IS RIDICULOUS THAT YOU

34:57.700 --> 35:00.900
LEFT.

34:57.700 --> 35:00.900
TURN THE CAR AROUND, GET YOUR

35:00.900 --> 35:08.033
ASS BACK HERE, AND BE A LEADER

35:00.900 --> 35:08.033
RIGHT NOW.

35:08.033 --> 35:13.433
FOR BUSINESS ADVICE AND EXTRA

35:09.100 --> 35:13.433
SCENES FROM THE SHOW, GO ON TO

35:10.533 --> 35:13.433
CNBC.COM/THE-PROFIT.

35:18.667 --> 35:17.133
ASS BACK HERE, AND BE A LEADER

35:18.667 --> 35:17.133
RIGHT NOW.

35:17.133 --> 35:27.900
 TURN THE CAR AROUND, GET YOUR

35:17.133 --> 35:27.900
DISAPPOINTMENT.

35:27.900 --> 35:24.800
NOT ONLY WALKING AWAY FROM HIS

35:27.900 --> 35:24.800
RE-GRAND OPENING, BUT HIS

35:24.800 --> 35:31.500
HANK HAS TURNED OUT TO BE A REAL

35:24.800 --> 35:31.500
UNWILLINGNESS TO MAKE

35:31.500 --> 35:34.567
THE CHANGES NECESSARY.

35:31.500 --> 35:34.567
HE'S PUSHED ME ON EVERYTHING.

35:34.567 --> 35:37.433
HE DOESN'T WANT TO GET RID OF

35:34.567 --> 35:37.433
OLD-AGE INVENTORY.

35:37.433 --> 35:39.400
HE DOESN'T WANT TO TAKE CASH TO

35:37.433 --> 35:39.400
THE FLOWER MART.

35:39.400 --> 35:43.033
HE DOESN'T WANT TO RAISE PRICES.

35:39.400 --> 35:43.033
I NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S

35:43.033 --> 35:44.833
A LEADER IN PLACE.

35:43.033 --> 35:44.833
AND THAT LEADER, FOR ME, IS

35:44.833 --> 35:47.133
MARINA.

35:44.833 --> 35:47.133
I WILL TELL YOU THAT, BASED ON

35:47.133 --> 35:50.433
WHAT I'VE SEEN SINCE THE DAY

35:47.133 --> 35:50.433
WHERE YOU WERE TAKEN OUT OF THAT

35:50.433 --> 35:54.000
JOB, YOU ARE A TOTALLY DIFFERENT

35:50.433 --> 35:54.000
MANAGER.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.033
I'VE WATCHED YOU INTERACT WITH

35:54.000 --> 35:56.033
THE EMPLOYEES.

35:56.033 --> 35:58.033
I'VE WATCHED YOU DISCIPLINE THEM

35:56.033 --> 35:58.033
PROPERLY.

35:58.033 --> 36:00.800
I'VE WATCHED YOU WORK.

35:58.033 --> 36:00.800
AND YOU FOUGHT THROUGH IT, AND

36:00.800 --> 36:02.767
YOU SAID, "YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M

36:00.800 --> 36:02.767
NOT GONNA WORRY ABOUT THE

36:02.767 --> 36:04.367
DEMOTION.

36:02.767 --> 36:04.367
I'M NOT GONNA WORRY ABOUT

36:04.367 --> 36:06.000
ANYTHING ELSE.

36:04.367 --> 36:06.000
I'M JUST GONNA DO MY JOB."

36:06.000 --> 36:08.333
THAT'S THE ATTITUDE THAT I SAW.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.333
YOU SHOULD BE VERY PROUD OF

36:08.333 --> 36:10.367
YOURSELF.

36:08.333 --> 36:10.367
 WELL, THANKS.

36:10.367 --> 36:13.800
 IN MY OPINION, YOU KNOW, YOU

36:10.367 --> 36:13.800
NEED TO CLEARLY BE THE LEADER

36:13.800 --> 36:17.200
WHEN HANK'S NOT HERE AND EVEN

36:13.800 --> 36:17.200
WHEN HANK'S HERE.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.700
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

36:17.200 --> 36:19.700
 THANKS.

36:19.700 --> 36:23.467
 ANYTIME I'M TESTING A LEADER,

36:19.700 --> 36:23.467
THERE'S ONE THING I WANT TO SEE.

36:23.467 --> 36:26.933
WILL THEY STAND SIDE BY SIDE

36:23.467 --> 36:26.933
WITH ME AND DO THE SAME WORK?

36:26.933 --> 36:28.533
WELL, THIS WEEK, MARINA DID

36:26.933 --> 36:28.533
THAT.

36:28.533 --> 36:31.800
CONGRATULATIONS.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.800
 THANK YOU.

36:29.900 --> 36:31.800
 YOU EARNED IT.

36:36.900 --> 36:39.200
IT'S BEEN A COUPLE DAYS SINCE

36:36.900 --> 36:39.200
THE RE-GRAND OPENING, AND I'VE

36:39.200 --> 36:41.600
TALKED TO MARINA.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.600
SHE TELLS ME BUSINESS IS REALLY

36:41.600 --> 36:43.933
PICKING UP.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.933
MORE IMPORTANTLY, THE NEW

36:43.933 --> 36:46.533
SYSTEMS THAT WE PUT IN PLACE,

36:43.933 --> 36:46.533
WELL, THEY'RE MAKING THINGS NOT

36:46.533 --> 36:49.867
ONLY MORE EFFICIENT, BUT

36:46.533 --> 36:49.867
MORALE'S AT AN ALL-TIME HIGH.

36:49.867 --> 36:52.333
TODAY, I SHOWED UP FOR A MEETING

36:49.867 --> 36:52.333
WITH HANK, WHO SAID HE NEEDED TO

36:52.333 --> 36:55.600
TALK.

36:52.333 --> 36:55.600
SEEN EACH OTHER SINCE HE TOOK

36:55.600 --> 36:53.100
OFF BEFORE THE RE-GRAND OPENING.

36:55.600 --> 36:53.100
HOW YOU DOING, BUDDY?

36:53.100 --> 37:00.267
IT'LL BE THE FIRST TIME WE'VE

36:53.100 --> 37:00.267
 GOOD. HOW ARE YOU?

37:00.267 --> 37:02.433
 I'M GOOD.

37:00.267 --> 37:02.433
WHAT'S THE GOOD WORD?

37:02.433 --> 37:04.167
 WELL, IT'S BEEN A DISRUPTIVE

37:02.433 --> 37:04.167
TWO WEEKS.

37:04.167 --> 37:07.100
I APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORT, BUT

37:04.167 --> 37:07.100
WHATEVER YOU TRIED DIDN'T REALLY

37:07.100 --> 37:08.667
WORK.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.667
BETWEEN YOU AND ME, I'M NOT

37:08.667 --> 37:11.433
GONNA TAKE YOUR DEAL.

37:08.667 --> 37:11.433
 WHY IS THAT?

37:11.433 --> 37:13.833
WE HAD A HANDSHAKE ON IT.

37:11.433 --> 37:13.833
 YEAH.

37:13.833 --> 37:15.633
I MEAN, THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF

37:13.833 --> 37:15.633
THAT YOU PROMISED THAT DIDN'T GO

37:15.633 --> 37:17.167
THROUGH.

37:15.633 --> 37:17.167
 LIKE WHAT? LIKE WHAT?

37:17.167 --> 37:19.200
 WELL, YOU SAID YOU WERE GONNA

37:17.167 --> 37:19.200
GIVE US 100,000.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.300
 I SPENT OVER 100,000.

37:19.200 --> 37:21.300
 WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU

37:21.300 --> 37:23.133
DID--SPENT.

37:21.300 --> 37:23.133
I MEAN, I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

37:23.133 --> 37:24.667
 HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK I'VE

37:23.133 --> 37:24.667
SPENT?

37:24.667 --> 37:27.500
 150,000.

37:24.667 --> 37:27.500
 YOU DIDN'T SEE ALL THIS BEING

37:27.500 --> 37:28.833
SPENT?

37:27.500 --> 37:28.833
 OH, I SAW SOME LIGHTS AND

37:28.833 --> 37:31.000
STUFF GOING UP.

37:28.833 --> 37:31.000
THAT WAS ABOUT IT.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.633
 YOU SAW SOME LIGHTS?

37:31.000 --> 37:32.633
 I SAW SOME--

37:32.633 --> 37:34.200
 HOW ABOUT THE GPSs THAT WENT

37:32.633 --> 37:34.200
IN THE VEHICLE?

37:34.200 --> 37:36.667
HOW ABOUT THE INVENTORY SYSTEM?

37:34.200 --> 37:36.667
 I SAW SOME--

37:36.667 --> 37:38.167
 HOW ABOUT THE CAMERA SYSTEM

37:36.667 --> 37:38.167
THAT WENT IN?

37:38.167 --> 37:39.600
 I SAW SOME GRAFFITI BEING

37:38.167 --> 37:39.600
PAINTED ON THE GARAGE.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.233
 HOW ABOUT THE NEW GLASS BEING

37:39.600 --> 37:41.233
DONE IN THE FRONT OF THE--

37:41.233 --> 37:46.000
 WELL, A COUPLE PANES OF GLASS

37:41.233 --> 37:46.000
IS NOT WORTH $100,000.

37:46.000 --> 37:47.900
 HANK, ARE YOU [bleep] KIDDING

37:46.000 --> 37:47.900
ME?

37:47.900 --> 37:49.500
 NO, I'M NOT [bleep] KIDDING.

37:47.900 --> 37:49.500
 YOU'RE GONNA TRY TO TELL ME

37:49.500 --> 37:50.967
THAT I DIDN'T PUT MONEY IN YOUR

37:49.500 --> 37:50.967
BUSINESS?

37:50.967 --> 37:52.867
 I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU DID,

37:50.967 --> 37:52.867
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T SHOW IT TO US.

37:52.867 --> 37:55.367
 WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE IT?

37:52.867 --> 37:55.367
 WELL, IT'S TOO LATE NOW.

37:55.367 --> 37:56.967
 WHY IS IT TOO LATE?

37:55.367 --> 37:56.967
 WE HAD A DEAL, AND YOU DIDN'T

37:56.967 --> 37:58.500
DO IT.

37:56.967 --> 37:58.500
AND YOU SAID BUSINESS WAS GONNA

37:58.500 --> 37:59.967
GO--

37:58.500 --> 37:59.967
 YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

37:59.967 --> 38:01.867
 'CAUSE SALES DIDN'T GO UP.

37:59.967 --> 38:01.867
 IN A MATTER OF TWO DAYS?

38:01.867 --> 38:03.433
 YOU SAID--

38:01.867 --> 38:03.433
 THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE NEVER

38:03.433 --> 38:04.767
HERE.

38:03.433 --> 38:04.767
 YOU SAID A WEEK.

38:04.767 --> 38:06.367
 THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW

38:04.767 --> 38:06.367
HOW TO MANAGE THIS PLACE.

38:06.367 --> 38:07.133
 WELL, THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

38:07.867 --> 38:10.067
BETTER CALL YOUR MAMA AND GET MY

38:08.600 --> 38:10.067
MONEY BACK.

38:14.300 --> 38:16.367
 SALES DIDN'T GO UP.

38:14.300 --> 38:16.367
 IN A MATTER OF TWO DAYS?

38:16.367 --> 38:17.933
 YOU SAID--

38:16.367 --> 38:17.933
 THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE NEVER

38:17.933 --> 38:19.300
HERE.

38:17.933 --> 38:19.300
 YOU SAID A WEEK.

38:19.300 --> 38:20.900
 THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW

38:19.300 --> 38:20.900
HOW TO MANAGE THIS PLACE.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.400
 WELL, THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

38:20.900 --> 38:22.400
 SO YOU'RE TELLING ME--YOU

38:22.400 --> 38:25.900
BETTER CALL YOUR MAMA AND GET MY

38:22.400 --> 38:25.900
JACOB MAARSE HASN'T TURNED

38:25.900 --> 38:28.233
A PROFIT IN YEARS.

38:25.900 --> 38:28.233
I'VE TURNED THIS PLACE AROUND IN

38:28.233 --> 38:23.133
ONE WEEK.

38:28.233 --> 38:23.133
AND ONE THING I KNOW FOR SURE, I

38:23.133 --> 38:32.133
MONEY BACK.

38:23.133 --> 38:32.133
CARE ABOUT THIS PLACE MORE THAN

38:32.133 --> 38:33.867
HE DOES.

38:32.133 --> 38:33.867
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE TO TAKE THIS

38:33.867 --> 38:36.033
PATH?

38:33.867 --> 38:36.033
 BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S

38:36.033 --> 38:37.933
A GOOD DEAL FOR US.

38:36.033 --> 38:37.933
 THEN WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST

38:37.933 --> 38:39.733
CALL AND SAY THAT?

38:37.933 --> 38:39.733
 BECAUSE I WANTED TO DO IT IN

38:39.733 --> 38:41.567
PERSON.

38:39.733 --> 38:41.567
 THIS WAY?

38:41.567 --> 38:44.433
 WELL, IT'S KIND OF YOUR

38:41.567 --> 38:44.433
STYLE.

38:44.433 --> 38:47.100
YOU KNOW, I LEARNED FROM YOU.

38:44.433 --> 38:47.100
 YOU'RE A PUNK, HANK.

38:47.100 --> 38:52.067
 WOW, THANKS.

38:47.100 --> 38:52.067
 WHEN HANK MAARSE DECIDED TO

38:52.067 --> 38:58.500
DISAPPOINTED.

38:52.067 --> 38:58.500
I WAS PISSED.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.367
 HELLO.

38:58.500 --> 39:00.367
 CLARA?

39:00.367 --> 39:01.067
 YES.

39:00.367 --> 39:01.067
BACK OUT OF THE DEAL, I WASN'T

39:01.067 --> 39:05.600
 HI, THIS IS MARCUS.

39:01.067 --> 39:05.600
HOW ARE YOU?

39:05.600 --> 39:09.767
WHEN YOU AND I FIRST TALKED,

39:05.600 --> 39:09.767
YOU TOLD ME THAT, IF I SPENT THE

39:09.767 --> 39:13.800
MONEY AND YOU DIDN'T WANT TO DO

39:09.767 --> 39:13.800
BACK, SO I WOULD LIKE MY MONEY

39:13.800 --> 39:11.433
BACK.

39:13.800 --> 39:11.433
I MEAN, HE'S GONNA HAVE TO GET

39:11.433 --> 39:21.933
THE DEAL, YOU'D GIVE ME MY MONEY

39:11.433 --> 39:21.933
IT FROM YOU, OBVIOUSLY.

39:21.933 --> 39:24.100
PERFECT.

39:21.933 --> 39:24.100
 WHY ARE YOU TALKING TO MY

39:24.100 --> 39:26.167
MOM?

39:24.100 --> 39:26.167
MOM, YOU DON'T HAVE TO TALK TO

39:26.167 --> 39:27.700
HIM.

39:26.167 --> 39:27.700
 BUT SHE ACTUALLY WAS--

39:27.700 --> 39:30.600
 I'M HANDLING IT.

39:27.700 --> 39:30.600
 SHE WAS ACTUALLY ON SPEAKER.

39:30.600 --> 39:32.067
 WHAT DID YOU TELL HER?

39:30.600 --> 39:32.067
 YOU KNOW SHE CAN'T--I'M

39:32.067 --> 39:34.833
TELLING HER WHAT HAPPENED.

39:32.067 --> 39:34.833
I'M TELLING HER THAT YOU DON'T

39:34.833 --> 39:37.000
WANT TO HONOR WHAT WE AGREED TO.

39:34.833 --> 39:37.000
 RIGHT.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.533
 25% OF THE PROFITS.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.533
 'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T HONOR IT.

39:39.533 --> 39:41.167
YOU SAID YOU'D DO IT IN A WEEK,

39:39.533 --> 39:41.167
AND YOU DIDN'T.

39:41.167 --> 39:42.733
 NO, I SAID I WAS IN CHARGE

39:41.167 --> 39:42.733
FOR A WEEK.

39:42.733 --> 39:44.500
I DIDN'T SAY THE WORLD WAS GONNA

39:42.733 --> 39:44.500
CHANGE IN A WEEK.

39:44.500 --> 39:46.467
 WELL, YOU PRETTY MUCH MADE IT

39:44.500 --> 39:46.467
SOUND LIKE IT WAS, AND IT

39:46.467 --> 39:49.467
DIDN'T.

39:46.467 --> 39:49.467
SO YOU HAPPY NOW THAT YOU HAD TO

39:49.467 --> 39:51.933
CALL MY MOM TO DO THAT?

39:49.467 --> 39:51.933
 WELL, I HAD TO CALL YOUR MOM.

39:51.933 --> 39:55.200
I MEAN, IT'S HER DECISION.

39:51.933 --> 39:55.200
 HANK, IT'S YOUR MOM'S

39:55.200 --> 39:57.000
DECISION.

39:55.200 --> 39:57.000
 NO, IT'S NOT.

39:57.000 --> 40:00.933
OKAY, ARE YOU DONE NOW WITH HER?

39:57.000 --> 40:00.933
 NO, IT'S MY DECISION.

40:00.933 --> 40:03.133
THANKS, MOM. I'LL HANDLE IT.

40:00.933 --> 40:03.133
 YEAH.

40:03.133 --> 40:05.067
 YOU JUST HUNG UP ON YOUR MOM

40:03.133 --> 40:05.067
NOW?

40:05.067 --> 40:06.533
 WHY ARE YOU CALLING HER?

40:05.067 --> 40:06.533
YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT?

40:06.533 --> 40:08.133
YOU CAN'T DEAL WITH ME?

40:06.533 --> 40:08.133
 FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU GREW

40:08.133 --> 40:10.000
A SET OF BALLS?

40:08.133 --> 40:10.000
 I DON'T KNOW.

40:10.000 --> 40:11.867
ARE YOU CHECKING?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.867
 ACTUALLY, I'M LOOKING FOR

40:11.867 --> 40:13.200
'EM.

40:11.867 --> 40:13.200
I CAN'T FIND 'EM.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.867
 OKAY. WELL, WHATEVER.

40:13.200 --> 40:15.867
 YOU DON'T MAKE A DEAL WITH

40:15.867 --> 40:17.567
SOMEONE AND THEN RENEGE.

40:15.867 --> 40:17.567
THAT'S NOT HOW IT--

40:17.567 --> 40:19.333
 YEAH, I KNOW.

40:17.567 --> 40:19.333
 HANK, YOU KNOW WHAT, I'M NOT

40:19.333 --> 40:21.900
GONNA WASTE MY TIME DEALING WITH

40:19.333 --> 40:21.900
SOMEBODY--

40:21.900 --> 40:23.367
 YOU DIDN'T KEEP UP YOUR PART

40:21.900 --> 40:23.367
OF THE BARGAIN.

40:23.367 --> 40:25.567
 I'M GONNA CALL YOUR MOTHER.

40:23.367 --> 40:25.567
DON'T TOUCH ME.

40:25.567 --> 40:28.133
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU THOUGHT I

40:25.567 --> 40:28.133
SPENT 150,000, WHICH IS NOT THE

40:28.133 --> 40:30.333
NUMBER, BY THE WAY.

40:28.133 --> 40:30.333
 YEAH. [scoffs]

40:30.333 --> 40:31.700
 WELL, WHY DID YOU SAY IT,

40:30.333 --> 40:31.700
THEN?

40:31.700 --> 40:34.233
 I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

40:31.700 --> 40:34.233
YOU PROBABLY SAID IT.

40:34.233 --> 40:36.067
 HANK, IT CAME OUT OF YOUR

40:34.233 --> 40:36.067
MOUTH.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.633
 NO, IT CAME OUT OF YOUR

40:36.067 --> 40:37.633
MOUTH, MARCUS, JUST LIKE A LOT

40:37.633 --> 40:39.100
OF STUFF COMES OUT OF YOUR

40:37.633 --> 40:39.100
MOUTH.

40:39.100 --> 40:40.533
 SO YOU'RE TELLING ME THIS

40:39.100 --> 40:40.533
PLACE--

40:40.533 --> 40:44.200
 "SALES WILL GO UP 200%."

40:40.533 --> 40:44.200
[muttering]

40:44.200 --> 40:47.000
WELL, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.

40:44.200 --> 40:47.000
 HANK, ARE YOU 49 OR 14?

40:47.000 --> 40:48.633
 49.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.633
 REALLY?

40:48.633 --> 40:52.533
 YEAH.

40:48.633 --> 40:52.533
THANKS, MARCUS.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.533
 HANK, HOW WOULD YOUR DAD FEEL

40:52.533 --> 40:54.533
ABOUT YOU DOING SOMETHING LIKE

40:54.533 --> 40:56.867
THIS?

40:54.533 --> 40:56.867
SOMEBODY COMES IN, THEY PUT

40:56.867 --> 40:59.433
MONEY IN WITH A HANDSHAKE.

40:56.867 --> 40:59.433
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

40:59.433 --> 41:02.367
THEY WORK THEIR ASS OFF.

40:59.433 --> 41:02.367
WE TRY TO MAKE THIS NICE THING.

41:02.367 --> 41:05.233
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE DEAL,

41:02.367 --> 41:05.233
YOU SHOULD BE A MAN ABOUT IT.

41:05.233 --> 41:06.667
BUT TO TELL SOMEBODY THEY DID

41:05.233 --> 41:06.667
NOTHING.

41:06.667 --> 41:08.200
 I'M NOT SAYING YOU DIDN'T DO

41:06.667 --> 41:08.200
ANYTHING.

41:08.200 --> 41:09.633
 YOUR DAD WOULD BE FRICKIN'

41:08.200 --> 41:09.633
EMBARRASSED OF YOU.

41:09.633 --> 41:11.000
 I'M NOT SAYING YOU DID

41:09.633 --> 41:11.000
NOTHING.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.500
I'M SAYING YOU DIDN'T DO WHAT

41:11.000 --> 41:12.500
YOU PROMISED.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.900
 GET OUT OF MY FACE.

41:12.500 --> 41:14.900
YOU'RE A THIEF AND A LIAR AND

41:14.900 --> 41:21.100
A CHEATER.

41:14.900 --> 41:21.100
LOOK, I'VE MADE REAL CHANGES

41:21.100 --> 41:24.867
HERE, BUT, AT THE END OF THE

41:21.100 --> 41:24.867
DAY, YOU CAN'T FIX A PERSON WHO

41:24.867 --> 41:27.600
JUST DOESN'T GET IT.

41:24.867 --> 41:27.600
IN ONE WEEK, I SPENT ABOUT

41:27.600 --> 41:32.567
$150,000, FIXING THE SYSTEMS,

41:27.600 --> 41:32.567
REPAIRING A BROKEN-DOWN

41:32.567 --> 41:35.800
BUILDING, PUTTING THINGS IN

41:32.567 --> 41:35.800
PLACE THAT I KNOW NOT ONLY FIXED

41:35.800 --> 41:38.400
MORALE, BUT THEY FIXED THE

41:35.800 --> 41:38.400
BUSINESS.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.667
HANK MADE A BIG MISTAKE.

41:38.400 --> 41:40.667
HE MISTOOK MY KINDNESS FOR

41:40.667 --> 41:43.233
WEAKNESS.

41:40.667 --> 41:43.233
THIS WASN'T A CHARITY.

41:43.233 --> 41:45.500
THIS WAS A BUSINESS DEAL, AND HE

41:43.233 --> 41:45.500
SHOOK MY HAND.

41:45.500 --> 41:47.200
SO I'M GONNA PUT A LIEN ON THE

41:45.500 --> 41:47.200
BUILDING, AND I'M GONNA DO

41:47.200 --> 41:52.633
WHATEVER IT TAKES TO GET MY

41:48.200 --> 41:52.633
MONEY BACK, MAKE NO MISTAKE

41:50.533 --> 41:52.633
ABOUT IT.
