08:51.490 --> 08:52.699
because you wear a top hat

08:52.740 --> 08:54.368
and pull white doves

08:52.740 --> 08:54.368
out of your pants.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.996
Fine. That's fine.

08:58.038 --> 08:59.580
In Jesse's defense..

08:59.622 --> 09:01.041
...when it comes to love..

09:01.082 --> 09:03.543
...I think anything is possible.

09:03.584 --> 09:06.296
I felt the same instant

09:03.584 --> 09:06.296
magic when I met Pam.

09:06.338 --> 09:09.049
She walked into

09:06.338 --> 09:09.049
my 10th grade geometry class

09:09.090 --> 09:11.885
sat down right next to me,

09:09.090 --> 09:11.885
and I said..

09:11.926 --> 09:14.095
[high-pitched]

09:11.926 --> 09:14.095
"Hi. Can I borrow

09:11.926 --> 09:14.095
your slide rule?"

09:16.390 --> 09:18.350
You didn't reach puberty

09:16.390 --> 09:18.350
by the 10th grade?

09:19.976 --> 09:22.103
Not till I met Pam.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.731
The next morning

09:22.145 --> 09:24.731
I woke up with a mustache.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.693
I'm sorry.

09:26.983 --> 09:28.693
No sale, boys.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.071
Love just does not

09:28.735 --> 09:31.071
happen that fast.

09:31.112 --> 09:33.407
Hey, guys, you know

09:31.112 --> 09:33.407
how I know it's real?

09:34.324 --> 09:36.284
I can't stop smiling.

09:36.326 --> 09:39.746
I'm just smiling away

09:36.326 --> 09:39.746
like I'm Nancy Reagan.

09:42.207 --> 09:44.376
I just can't stop smiling.

09:45.752 --> 09:48.671
I stopped, thanks to him.

09:48.713 --> 09:50.882
But Corinna and me

09:48.713 --> 09:50.882
were madly in love.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.884
We did see him kissing.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.969
- Ew!

09:55.011 --> 09:58.139
Jesse, please stop making out

09:55.011 --> 09:58.139
in front of my kids.

09:58.181 --> 10:00.350
Mr. Back-stabber..

10:00.392 --> 10:03.186
...why don't you tell everybody

10:00.392 --> 10:03.186
what you did today?

10:04.479 --> 10:07.815
Well, I woke up,

10:04.479 --> 10:07.815
turned off the alarm

10:07.857 --> 10:09.276
did that stretching thing--

10:09.317 --> 10:11.819
Not the stretching thing,

10:09.317 --> 10:11.819
the back-stabbing thing!

10:11.861 --> 10:13.738
Hey, could you pick up

10:11.861 --> 10:13.738
the pace a little bit?

10:13.780 --> 10:14.781
I'd like to get

10:13.780 --> 10:14.781
the girls to bed

10:14.822 --> 10:16.241
before "Good morning, America."

10:18.452 --> 10:20.287
Well, it was stormy, and..

10:20.328 --> 10:21.996
...me and Danny and the girls

10:20.328 --> 10:21.996
were getting ready

10:22.038 --> 10:23.498
to watch "The Wizard of Oz."

10:25.708 --> 10:28.753
Here we go. Popcorn<i> du jour.</i>

10:28.795 --> 10:30.755
All in honor of Stephanie's

10:28.795 --> 10:30.755
first viewing

10:30.797 --> 10:32.382
of "The Wizard of Oz."

10:32.424 --> 10:34.008
I'm psyched.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.094
You should be, honey.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.094
It's the sweetest little movie.

10:36.136 --> 10:37.678
There's this pretty girl Dorothy

10:37.720 --> 10:39.931
and she's got this

10:37.720 --> 10:39.931
adorable dog Toto

10:39.973 --> 10:42.934
who gets kidnapped

10:39.973 --> 10:42.934
by this horrible witch.

10:42.976 --> 10:44.185
But she gets her dog back

10:44.227 --> 10:45.853
and her house flies

10:44.227 --> 10:45.853
through the air

10:45.895 --> 10:49.608
and then it-it lands

10:45.895 --> 10:49.608
on this other horrible witch

10:49.649 --> 10:52.235
whose feet curl up

10:49.649 --> 10:52.235
like party favors.

10:52.277 --> 10:53.653

10:57.240 --> 10:59.951
Hi. I'm, uh, Joey.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.951
Can I help you, please?

10:59.993 --> 11:02.496
- I'm here to see Jesse.

10:59.993 --> 11:02.496
- Aren't they all?

11:02.537 --> 11:04.998
I'm Corinna Spencer.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.998
I have a guitar lesson.

11:05.039 --> 11:07.542
Oh, Jesse called to say

11:05.039 --> 11:07.542
he's running a little bit late.

11:07.584 --> 11:09.919
Uh, would you like to watch

11:07.584 --> 11:09.919
"The Wizard of Oz" with us?

11:09.961 --> 11:11.296
Oh, that's

11:09.961 --> 11:11.296
my favorite movie. Yeah.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.298
Uh, it's mine, too.

11:11.338 --> 11:13.298
Come on in.

Stephanie, DJ, and Michelle.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.179
- Corinna.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.179

- Hi.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.640
[thunder rumbling]

11:21.680 --> 11:24.518
Oh, dad, something happened

11:21.680 --> 11:24.518
to the TV.

11:24.559 --> 11:26.520
It's snowing in Kansas.

11:26.561 --> 11:29.356
The cable goes out every

11:26.561 --> 11:29.356
time there's a storm.

11:29.397 --> 11:30.940
Fix it.

11:30.982 --> 11:33.109
Steph, this is not something

11:30.982 --> 11:33.109
I can fix.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.528
Fix it.

11:34.569 --> 11:36.363
Steph, I'm gonna call

11:34.569 --> 11:36.363
the cable company.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.948
You'll get a busy signal.

11:38.990 --> 11:40.992
Fix it.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.744
Why wasn't I born

11:41.034 --> 11:43.744
a cable repairman?

11:46.456 --> 11:50.001
Somebody do something.

11:46.456 --> 11:50.001
I'm very upset.

11:50.043 --> 11:52.711
Okay, everybody gather around

11:50.043 --> 11:52.711
for "The Wizard of Oz."

are you checking on?

15:25.508 --> 15:28.386

Yeah, well,

15:28.428 --> 15:30.805
Jesse's really a terrific guy

15:30.847 --> 15:34.475
and we had a really

15:30.847 --> 15:34.475
nice day together.

15:34.517 --> 15:36.143
But to be honest,

15:34.517 --> 15:36.143
there was nothing

15:36.185 --> 15:37.812
really special between us.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.734
in life that's sacred..

...you never mess

15:42.776 --> 15:44.778
with a buddy's girl.

All Jesse and I

15:46.487 --> 15:47.822
had between us

15:47.864 --> 15:50.199
was one little

15:50.241 --> 15:52.118
It was nothing, really.

15:52.159 --> 15:54.704
It was one of these.

15:54.746 --> 15:57.707
Oh, that right there,

15:54.746 --> 15:57.707
that was-that was nothing.

15:57.749 --> 16:00.209
It's how I kiss my grandmother.

16:00.251 --> 16:02.837
You must be very close.

16:02.879 --> 16:05.506
It was like four lips

So where was I?

16:33.033 --> 16:36.496
I came in and found you

16:33.033 --> 16:36.496
kissing the woman of my dreams.

16:36.537 --> 16:37.831
Oh, yeah.

16:37.872 --> 16:39.874
Good memory.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.417
'So there we were.'

16:41.459 --> 16:43.085
Jesse had walked in to find me

16:43.127 --> 16:45.171
kissing the woman of his dreams.

16:49.216 --> 16:50.468
Oh, good. You're home.

16:52.386 --> 16:55.139
What the hell's

16:52.386 --> 16:55.139
going on here?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.433
Well, Jesse, actually,

16:55.181 --> 16:57.433
it's-it's very simple.

16:57.475 --> 17:00.687
Um, Corinna was choking

16:57.475 --> 17:00.687
on some bad cheese

17:00.728 --> 17:03.439
so I initiated

17:00.728 --> 17:03.439
a Heimlich maneuver.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.274
And when that didn't work

17:05.316 --> 17:08.695
I tried to suck out

17:05.316 --> 17:08.695
the cheese..

17:08.736 --> 17:10.404
...using the hoover maneuver.

17:12.907 --> 17:14.283
So you weren't kissing?

17:14.325 --> 17:16.327
You were searching for cheese?

17:18.496 --> 17:19.831
You look upset.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.958
Oh, why would I be upset?

17:22.000 --> 17:24.544
You saving the life of someone

17:22.000 --> 17:24.544
who's very special to me.

17:24.585 --> 17:27.005
- Jesse--

17:24.585 --> 17:27.005
- Oh, Corinna, please.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.422
Now, I'm not really in the mood

17:28.464 --> 17:29.841
to give a guitar lesson tonight.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.384
Besides, you're probably

17:29.883 --> 17:31.384
still reeling

17:31.425 --> 17:33.260
from that near death by cheese.

17:34.428 --> 17:36.472
Why don't you

17:34.428 --> 17:36.472
go home and practice?

17:41.811 --> 17:43.688
Jesse, wait a minute.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.733
There's something

17:43.730 --> 17:46.733
I have to say.

17:46.774 --> 17:48.526
Corinna really wasn't choking

17:48.568 --> 17:49.944
on any bad cheese.

17:49.986 --> 17:51.111
No!

17:53.364 --> 17:54.365
We were kissing.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.533
No!

17:58.745 --> 18:01.288
Corinna, Joey and I

17:58.745 --> 18:01.288
should probably, uh..

18:01.330 --> 18:02.832
have a word together alone.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.005
Look, I'm-I'm really sorry

18:05.793 --> 18:09.005
if there's any misunderstanding.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.339
I didn't mean

18:09.047 --> 18:10.339
to cause any trouble.

18:10.381 --> 18:11.674
Oh, there won't be any trouble.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.342
Jesse and I are

18:11.716 --> 18:13.342
very close friends.

18:13.384 --> 18:16.012
We'll have a heart to heart

18:13.384 --> 18:16.012
and work this thing out

18:16.054 --> 18:18.973
in a very calm,

18:16.054 --> 18:18.973
rational, adult manner.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.568
Come here! Come here, you!

18:34.238 --> 18:35.531
Freeze!

18:35.573 --> 18:37.241
I have a baby

18:35.573 --> 18:37.241
and I know how to use it.

18:37.283 --> 18:40.578
- Joey--

18:37.283 --> 18:40.578
- I'm warning you, she's loaded.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.455
Put the baby down.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.373
Not a chance.

18:44.415 --> 18:46.333
Good.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.127
Okay, fine. I'll wait.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.088
You've got to put

18:48.168 --> 18:50.088
the kid down sometime.

18:50.129 --> 18:51.672
Two or three days,

18:50.129 --> 18:51.672
that diaper's gonna weigh

18:51.714 --> 18:53.173
five to six hundred pounds.

18:55.093 --> 18:57.428
Jesse, I'm really sorry.

18:57.470 --> 18:59.013
I should have stopped

18:57.470 --> 18:59.013
everything cold

18:59.055 --> 19:01.015
before anything happened.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.266
I should have talked to you.

19:02.308 --> 19:04.351
- Really?

19:02.308 --> 19:04.351
- Yeah, you-you were right.

19:04.393 --> 19:06.562
I-I felt this instant magic

19:06.604 --> 19:08.397
and I fell in love with her.

19:08.439 --> 19:09.690
You fell in love with her?

19:09.732 --> 19:10.942
You can't fall

19:09.732 --> 19:10.942
in love with her, man.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.569
I fell in love with her first!

19:13.611 --> 19:15.780
I'm sorry,

19:13.611 --> 19:15.780
but she likes me more.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.658
How can she like you

19:15.822 --> 19:18.658
more than she likes me?

19:18.699 --> 19:21.661
Boys, stop this.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.080
Michelle has enough love

19:21.702 --> 19:24.080
for all of us.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.749
Don't make her choose.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.960
Now, both of you,

19:26.791 --> 19:28.960
give her a kiss.

19:29.002 --> 19:30.795
Go ahead. Give her a kiss.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.547
[Michelle cooing]

19:43.933 --> 19:46.435
So now a second woman

19:43.933 --> 19:46.435
had come between us.

19:46.477 --> 19:47.937
I wanted to talk things out

19:47.979 --> 19:51.398
but Jesse said

19:47.979 --> 19:51.398
he couldn't stand to look at me.

19:51.440 --> 19:53.067
Apparently, a Louisville slugger

19:53.109 --> 19:54.986
puts him in the mood

19:53.109 --> 19:54.986
for a conversation.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.405
I told you I heard a noise.

19:55.028 --> 19:58.405
I wasn't gonna bat you.

19:58.447 --> 20:01.034
Alright, girls,

19:58.447 --> 20:01.034
it's time to go to sleep.

20:01.075 --> 20:02.869
Your Uncle Jesse

20:01.075 --> 20:02.869
and Joey have told you

20:02.910 --> 20:04.745
a wonderful bedtime story.

20:04.787 --> 20:06.372
I'm sure you'll have visions

20:06.413 --> 20:09.876
of jealous little sugarplums

20:06.413 --> 20:09.876
dancing in your heads.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.171
Wait a minute.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.171
How does the story end?

20:13.212 --> 20:16.049
Well, Joey's guilt

20:13.212 --> 20:16.049
drives him totally insane.

20:16.090 --> 20:17.466
But no one knows

20:16.090 --> 20:17.466
the difference.

20:19.052 --> 20:20.720
I don't think so.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.305
Wake us up and tell us

20:20.761 --> 20:23.305
who gets the girl.

20:23.347 --> 20:24.682
There's a whole different world

20:24.724 --> 20:27.810
that starts the second

20:24.724 --> 20:27.810
we go to sleep.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.562
- Goodnight.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.815
Guys, come here.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.692
What do you want now?

20:34.734 --> 20:36.527
Before you guys duel

20:34.734 --> 20:36.527
to the death

20:36.569 --> 20:38.738
let's have one more

20:36.569 --> 20:38.738
conversation to work this out.

20:38.779 --> 20:40.447
Not with this scum.

20:40.489 --> 20:43.201
Okay, then, just talk to me.

20:43.242 --> 20:45.285
Let me ask you boys

20:43.242 --> 20:45.285
a question or two

20:45.327 --> 20:47.580
about your beloved Corinna.

20:47.621 --> 20:49.916
What are the things she cares

20:47.621 --> 20:49.916
about most in the world?

20:52.459 --> 20:55.588
What does she look for

20:52.459 --> 20:55.588
in a relationship with a man?

20:57.673 --> 20:59.675
Let's try this one.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.675
What color are her eyes?

20:59.717 --> 21:00.760
- Hazel.

20:59.717 --> 21:00.760
- Green.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.095
Green-hazel, hazel-green.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.763
They have white around

21:02.136 --> 21:03.763
the edge, I think.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.724
Anybody know her last name?

21:06.766 --> 21:08.517
- Spicer.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.020
Pat Sajak knows more

21:08.559 --> 21:11.020
about his contestants.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.356
You know, I don't think..

21:14.398 --> 21:16.817
...you fell in love

21:14.398 --> 21:16.817
with Corinna.

21:16.859 --> 21:17.985
That takes time.

21:19.361 --> 21:21.114
I think maybe you fell in love

21:21.155 --> 21:23.824
with being in love.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.243
Am I right, Jesse?

21:27.828 --> 21:30.790
I do seem to fall

21:27.828 --> 21:30.790
in love a lot.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.917
But it's just

21:30.831 --> 21:32.917
because I'm always hoping

21:32.959 --> 21:35.294
that this is the one.

21:35.335 --> 21:37.379
I just want to meet

21:35.335 --> 21:37.379
one nice, special girl

21:37.421 --> 21:39.590
I can spend my life with.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.801
Aw, Jesse.

21:41.842 --> 21:44.011
Everybody wants that.

21:44.053 --> 21:46.722
But you don't

21:44.053 --> 21:46.722
have to try so hard.

21:46.764 --> 21:49.142
When the right

21:46.764 --> 21:49.142
woman comes along..

21:49.183 --> 21:50.810
...you really will know it.

21:52.728 --> 21:56.149
I could have sworn

21:52.728 --> 21:56.149
Corinna was it.

21:56.190 --> 21:58.943
[sighs]

21:56.190 --> 21:58.943
Maybe I did go

21:56.190 --> 21:58.943
a little overboard.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.319
I guess I was just shocked

22:00.360 --> 22:03.489
that she liked me

22:00.360 --> 22:03.489
as much as I liked her.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.241
Why are you shocked?

22:05.283 --> 22:06.533
Have a little faith

22:05.283 --> 22:06.533
in yourself.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.701
You're a good guy.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.705
As much as I hate to admit it..

22:11.747 --> 22:13.040
...it seems like

22:11.747 --> 22:13.040
Corinna likes you

22:13.082 --> 22:15.960
more than she likes me.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.878
God, I hate to admit it.

22:20.965 --> 22:23.550
Alright, you're not scum.

22:23.592 --> 22:26.012
I know that comes

22:23.592 --> 22:26.012
from your heart, Jess.

22:26.053 --> 22:29.347
That was almost semi-touching.

22:29.389 --> 22:30.975
[Corinna sneezes]

22:31.017 --> 22:33.519
You hear that noise?

22:31.017 --> 22:33.519
I told you someone's out here.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.521
- Hi.

22:33.560 --> 22:35.521
- Corinna?

22:35.562 --> 22:37.982
What are you doing here?

22:35.562 --> 22:37.982
Come in.

22:38.024 --> 22:40.109
I-I really felt terrible

22:38.024 --> 22:40.109
about tonight

22:40.151 --> 22:42.360
and I came back to apologize.

22:42.402 --> 22:44.155
'But then I heard shouting,

22:42.402 --> 22:44.155
so I decided to go home.'

22:44.197 --> 22:46.657
Then I felt even worse,

22:44.197 --> 22:46.657
so I decided to come back.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.744
Look...you both are great guys

22:50.786 --> 22:52.412
and I would hate to do anything

22:52.454 --> 22:54.207
to mess up your friendship.

22:54.248 --> 22:56.625
I'm really sorry.

22:56.667 --> 22:59.337
Okay, now I'm going

22:56.667 --> 22:59.337
to go home again. Goodbye.

22:59.377 --> 23:02.215
Hold on a second.

23:02.256 --> 23:03.507
I may have met you first

23:03.549 --> 23:05.383
but I...think we all know

23:05.425 --> 23:07.803
who belongs together here.

23:07.845 --> 23:09.847
Why don't you take

23:07.845 --> 23:09.847
some time and..

23:09.889 --> 23:11.140
...get to know Joey.

23:11.182 --> 23:12.641
He's a good guy.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.310
He's got pajama problems, but..

23:16.062 --> 23:17.521
I love this guy.

23:17.563 --> 23:18.814
Hug her, not me.

23:18.856 --> 23:20.774
- Sorry.

23:18.856 --> 23:20.774
- Big dummy.

23:20.816 --> 23:22.318
Come on, Jesse,

23:20.816 --> 23:22.318
let's leave these two alone.

...what were you really

23:26.155 --> 23:28.366
gonna do with the bat?

23:28.406 --> 23:29.992
I was gonna kill him.

23:31.285 --> 23:33.079
That's what I would have done.

- Ew!

- Goodnight.

23:42.629 --> 23:44.882
- 'Goodnight.'

- Goodnight.
