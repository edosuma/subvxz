01:13.800 --> 01:17.162
Obsessional, negative
thoughts about work.

01:17.498 --> 01:22.053
The hours, ludicrous staff meetings...

01:22.363 --> 01:25.452
...the stink of the halls
and the patients.

01:26.561 --> 01:27.924
The patients....

01:29.659 --> 01:33.986
You find yourself searching
for ways not to hate them.

01:34.357 --> 01:36.821
You know, little tricks, like...

01:38.054 --> 01:41.110
...she shares a birthday
with your mother...

01:41.319 --> 01:44.045
...or he looks like
the brother of a friend.

01:47.249 --> 01:48.771
lt doesn't work.

01:51.348 --> 01:52.973
You feel nothing.

01:53.979 --> 01:57.603
Every drop of pleasure
has drained from your life.

01:59.243 --> 02:01.105
You can't sleep.

02:01.309 --> 02:03.705
You can't think.
You can't concentrate--

02:08.139 --> 02:09.126
Trouble sleeping?

02:11.637 --> 02:15.068
No, l was just catching up
on some work.

02:22.532 --> 02:26.019
l worry you're not getting
enough sleep. Are you okay?

02:26.430 --> 02:27.759
Fine.

02:28.228 --> 02:29.989
What are you working on?

02:31.560 --> 02:32.991
Patient history.

02:36.224 --> 02:39.121
-Div....
-Listen, you go back to bed.

02:39.290 --> 02:40.277
Okay?

02:45.187 --> 02:46.345
lt's late.

04:02.580 --> 04:04.205
Who is it?

04:04.413 --> 04:06.877
You think that l could maybe--

04:07.444 --> 04:08.875
Come in?

04:10.410 --> 04:11.397
Thank you.

04:12.276 --> 04:15.297
Rain stopped.
lt's gonna be a beautiful day.

04:18.471 --> 04:19.903
Have you seen my razor?

04:20.105 --> 04:21.228
l don't think so.

04:21.437 --> 04:23.231
Sorry about the mess.

04:23.736 --> 04:27.132
l'm amazed how much stuff women
can fit in an overnight bag.

04:27.334 --> 04:29.265
Just the bare essentials.

04:30.999 --> 04:33.828
''Hydrating eye mask number four.''

04:34.031 --> 04:35.723
Takes five years off.

04:35.930 --> 04:37.190
Really?

04:38.328 --> 04:40.792
Are you packed?
We'll be rushing tonight.

04:40.994 --> 04:42.788
Yeah, except for my razor.

04:42.993 --> 04:45.822
Good.
Oh, Mr. Button missed a hole.

04:46.025 --> 04:47.489
Come here.

04:47.690 --> 04:49.484
l'll pick you up after work.

04:49.689 --> 04:53.744
We'll be in Nassau by morning,
and the next three days...

04:54.020 --> 04:55.315
...you're mine.

04:56.019 --> 04:57.348
Sounds good to me.

04:58.418 --> 05:01.610
l tell you, l feel funny about
you paying for everything.

05:01.817 --> 05:03.247
Oh, please.

05:03.449 --> 05:06.845
We both know you don't make any money.
You're a resident.

05:07.047 --> 05:09.171
A pediatric resident.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.902
You know what?

05:13.111 --> 05:16.939
That blue Armani shirt l got you
would go better with this tie.

05:17.941 --> 05:19.304
Happy Thanksgiving.

05:32.434 --> 05:35.331
-Malik, Happy Thanksgiving.
-You too. Nice shirt.

05:35.499 --> 05:36.486
Thanks.

05:41.430 --> 05:43.621
-Hi, Dr. Ross.
-Hi.

05:45.361 --> 05:47.917
Excuse--
What's your name?

05:48.492 --> 05:51.979
-Bob. Happy Thanksgiving.
-Happy Thanksgiving to you, Bob.

05:52.190 --> 05:54.246
These are Halloween decorations.

05:54.456 --> 05:56.046
We just took those down.

05:56.255 --> 05:58.345
No, l...

05:58.720 --> 06:00.049
...put up.

06:00.253 --> 06:01.241
See?

06:02.018 --> 06:03.279
Yes, l see.

06:03.885 --> 06:04.975
Carry on.

06:10.581 --> 06:13.603
-Dr. Ross.
-Hey, Jer, what's the good word?

06:13.813 --> 06:16.743
l got a little interoffice
minutiae for you here.

06:17.111 --> 06:19.473
Your contribution
to the potluck dinner?

06:19.677 --> 06:22.698
lt's pecan pie.
l bought it myself.

06:24.408 --> 06:26.236
Don't be shy.
Just help yourself.

06:26.439 --> 06:27.462
Thanks.

06:28.471 --> 06:30.732
Dr. John, what do you
got over there?

06:31.304 --> 06:32.963
l'm practicing sutures.

06:33.503 --> 06:34.490
What is that?

06:35.435 --> 06:36.832
Oh, it's a pig's foot.

06:38.100 --> 06:40.621
The elasticity's comparable
to human skin.

06:40.832 --> 06:44.421
lt's great for practicing. l've got
half a dozen in my freezer at home.

06:44.630 --> 06:46.788
Carter, are you snacking
between meals?

06:46.995 --> 06:49.824
See what's holding up the blood gases
on the wheezer in 3.

06:50.028 --> 06:51.515
You got it. Hey, Doug.

06:51.726 --> 06:53.191
Good morning, Carol.

06:54.559 --> 06:57.251
Still going to Bermuda,
or can you work Saturday night?

06:57.456 --> 07:00.512
The Bahamas, and forget it.
l'm gone.

07:01.255 --> 07:02.947
Jen and Rach coming down?

07:03.154 --> 07:04.778
And her folks.

07:05.220 --> 07:06.515
Dinner with the reverend.

07:08.185 --> 07:11.343
-Kid with the croup in 3.
-Thank you, Lydia.

07:20.379 --> 07:21.844
Terrific.

07:23.377 --> 07:26.206
When things slow down,
l need to talk to you.

07:26.409 --> 07:27.567
All right.

07:29.707 --> 07:30.694
Carol....

07:31.406 --> 07:32.394
Thank you.

07:33.871 --> 07:35.166
Who put this here?

07:35.604 --> 07:36.864
l believe it was Bob.

07:37.069 --> 07:38.796
Can we move it somewhere?

07:39.003 --> 07:40.900
We can certainly try.

07:44.966 --> 07:47.522
Thanksgiving.
What a farce!

07:47.731 --> 07:50.128
What do we gotta be grateful for, huh?

07:50.329 --> 07:54.259
<i>Rwanda? Flesh-eating bacteria?
Entertainment Tonight?</i>

07:54.461 --> 07:57.221
-Mr. Luck, quiet.
-Piss off!

07:57.426 --> 07:59.652
That's ironic, coming from
a man with no kidneys.

07:59.858 --> 08:01.084
Labs are back.

08:01.291 --> 08:03.482
He's uremic.
Blood alcohol's .25.

08:03.689 --> 08:06.245
And the media. Brainwashers,
all of them...

08:06.455 --> 08:08.283
...filling kids' heads with filth!

08:08.487 --> 08:12.281
<i>I love you, you love me
We're a happy family</i>

08:12.985 --> 08:15.882
Mr. Luck, how long has it been
since you were dialyzed?

08:16.083 --> 08:19.139
Those Nazis at the clinic
won't let me in the door.

08:19.648 --> 08:22.374
Apparently Mr. Luck was banned
for abusing the staff.

08:22.580 --> 08:24.840
l got a right to my opinion, don't l?

08:25.045 --> 08:27.566
Mr. Luck, you're an end-stage
renal failure.

08:27.777 --> 08:30.173
But don't worry.
We're going to save your life.

08:30.376 --> 08:31.773
Such as it is.

08:32.008 --> 08:34.097
Prep him for dialysis.
l'll get the machine.

08:34.307 --> 08:36.533
And you know what really gets me?

08:36.739 --> 08:41.169
All this talk about
an ''information superhighway.''

08:41.669 --> 08:44.134
Five hundred channels of crap!

08:44.402 --> 08:47.991
You know, the more l see of people,
the more l like pigs.

08:49.832 --> 08:52.729
42-year-old woman crashed
into a bridge abutment.

08:52.931 --> 08:55.952
She's alert and oriented.
Vitals are normal.

08:56.163 --> 08:59.059
-Should l bring anything for tonight?
-Tonight?

08:59.261 --> 09:01.851
Thanksgiving dinner.
Your mother invited me.

09:02.060 --> 09:05.286
Carter, my mother isn't in control
of her faculties.

09:05.492 --> 09:06.752
So...

09:06.957 --> 09:08.354
...l'm not invited now?

09:08.556 --> 09:10.418
Don't your parents want you at home?

09:10.622 --> 09:13.552
My parents are in Switzerland
visiting my sister.

09:14.253 --> 09:15.479
Switzerland, huh?

09:21.250 --> 09:23.078
-Have you seen Mookie?
-No.

09:23.648 --> 09:25.238
Mrs. Carleton, l'm Dr. Benton.

09:25.447 --> 09:29.242
We're gonna make sure you don't
have any serious injuries, okay?

09:29.445 --> 09:31.535
Carter, take a look at the head.

09:33.177 --> 09:35.108
This isn't gonna hurt a bit.

09:39.041 --> 09:41.369
Okay. Do you feel any
pain here, ma'am?

09:41.606 --> 09:43.003
Okay. What about here?

09:44.004 --> 09:46.162
A little blood in the canals.
Excuse me.

09:49.569 --> 09:52.295
We've got a deep lac here.
About 1 0 centimeters.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.692
Don't worry.
There won't be scarring.

09:54.899 --> 09:59.090
Penetrating lac on the right side.
Ma'am, we have to remove your clothes.

10:00.663 --> 10:03.957
Okay, if you could just turn
on your side, please.

10:05.060 --> 10:06.048
Okay.

10:06.426 --> 10:08.584
Lower back looks good.

10:09.624 --> 10:11.919
Upper back looks good.
A few scratches.

10:12.124 --> 10:14.816
Contusion to the left scapula,
no costal--

10:15.022 --> 10:19.316
Dr. Benton? We seem to have
a new piece of information here.

10:19.753 --> 10:22.309
With superficial bruises
along the co--

10:22.585 --> 10:23.777
Coccyx.

10:26.116 --> 10:28.842
Could somebody please get me a gown?

10:33.813 --> 10:35.835
-Mr. Carleton--
-l go by ''Miss.''

10:36.044 --> 10:38.532
Trauma coming.
MVA, 3 people, all critical.

10:39.810 --> 10:42.968
Alright, Carter, take her
next door and sew her up.

10:44.807 --> 10:46.238
By myself?

10:47.971 --> 10:50.527
High-speed collision.
Two teenagers in one car.

10:50.737 --> 10:54.361
Both thrown from the vehicle,
one unconscious. Head injuries.

10:54.568 --> 10:56.295
-Vitals?
-None. Looks like a loser.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.261
Doug, we need your help!

10:59.266 --> 11:00.731
What have we got?

11:03.297 --> 11:05.558
-Talk to me.
-Traumatic full arrest.

11:05.762 --> 11:08.454
-Here comes the second one.
-Clear the way!

11:08.628 --> 11:09.616
He's conscious.

11:09.860 --> 11:13.416
Broken right femur, pressure 90 over 60.
Pulse 1 1 0. Let's go.

11:13.625 --> 11:15.284
-Someone call Ortho.
-lt hurts!

11:15.491 --> 11:16.978
-Where does it hurt?
-My guts.

11:17.190 --> 11:20.053
-What happened?
-Ran a red, hit a 22-year-old girl.

11:20.255 --> 11:22.447
-He the driver?
-Don't know. Car belonged to...

11:22.654 --> 11:24.017
...Larry Parks.

11:24.319 --> 11:26.682
-Are you Larry Parks?
-No, Andy.

11:28.184 --> 11:30.547
-That must be the girl.
-They left her there.

11:30.750 --> 11:32.180
Decapitated.

11:37.413 --> 11:39.878
Okay, Andy? Andy, tell me
where it hurts.

11:40.078 --> 11:41.237
Here? Here?

11:41.444 --> 11:42.501
Everywhere!

11:42.710 --> 11:44.698
Carol, we need to hold him down.

11:46.308 --> 11:48.170
-You gotta stay still.
-lt hurts!

11:48.374 --> 11:51.066
-Can we give him something?
-50 mg of Demerol.

11:51.272 --> 11:52.568
Let's prep for lavage.

11:52.772 --> 11:54.397
-l need a catheter.
-l got it.

11:57.536 --> 11:58.523
Any heart sounds?

11:58.735 --> 12:01.325
-Negative.
-Give him more atropine.

12:02.933 --> 12:04.898
-A lot of gray matter here.
-Oh, God.

12:05.099 --> 12:06.121
ls he salvageable?

12:06.332 --> 12:07.422
Call Neuro.

12:09.430 --> 12:11.327
Get the saline and tube ready.

12:11.728 --> 12:13.886
l'm not giving up yet.
Come on.

12:18.159 --> 12:19.522
Wait! What are you doing?

12:20.924 --> 12:24.547
Relax. They gave you an
anesthetic so you won't be in pain.

12:24.756 --> 12:26.016
Why are they cutting me?

12:26.222 --> 12:29.743
Listen to me. My name is Carol.
l'll tell you what's happening.

12:30.486 --> 12:34.939
They made a nick in your belly so they
can fill your abdomen with fluid.

12:35.317 --> 12:38.974
Once it's full, they'll watch
as the fluid drains out.

12:39.614 --> 12:41.670
lf blood comes out,
you have injuries...

12:41.880 --> 12:44.038
...and you'll need to have surgery.

12:50.209 --> 12:51.731
What do you think?

13:10.898 --> 13:13.056
Call the O.R., tell them
we're on our way.

13:13.263 --> 13:15.455
-You're going to surgery now.
-Oh, God!

13:18.295 --> 13:19.816
Larry!

13:20.127 --> 13:22.285
Time of death, 9:33.

13:22.459 --> 13:23.447
Oh, God.

13:23.758 --> 13:24.781
Let's move.

13:29.155 --> 13:31.211
l'll make sure we got a room.

13:31.421 --> 13:32.408
Carol.

13:33.087 --> 13:34.518
-lt was me.
-What was you?

13:34.720 --> 13:37.446
l was driving Larry's car.
lt's my fault.

13:37.651 --> 13:39.082
l killed him.

13:39.317 --> 13:41.179
Oh, God, l killed him!

14:21.162 --> 14:22.219
The space shuttle.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.189
Now there's a bright idea.

14:24.394 --> 14:28.381
Let's spend 50 billion
so six guys can sit in a tin can...

14:28.591 --> 14:31.249
...and test the effect
of weightlessness on fruit flies.

14:31.457 --> 14:33.978
-ls that kid gonna make it?
-l think so.

14:34.189 --> 14:35.881
One out of three.
What a waste.

14:36.088 --> 14:38.984
When l see that, l think,
''There but for the grace of God....''

14:39.153 --> 14:40.141
Tell me about it.

14:40.352 --> 14:43.839
ln high school, we'd race
this guy's TR7 on River Road...

14:44.051 --> 14:46.413
...pin the speedometer at 1 20.

14:46.616 --> 14:49.580
We'd climb those giant TV
antennas up to the top.

14:49.781 --> 14:52.245
-Must've been 200, 300 feet.
-You did that?

14:52.446 --> 14:54.842
Otto Jevitch.
His dad was a demolitions expert.

14:55.045 --> 14:57.340
We'd steal dynamite
and play chicken.

14:58.109 --> 15:01.404
l don't believe you.
The worst thing Howie and l ever did...

15:01.608 --> 15:04.698
...was Chinese fire drills
at the Velvet Freeze.

15:05.340 --> 15:08.429
l guess you and Howie
were born to be wild.

15:11.670 --> 15:13.328
Did l miss something?

15:13.635 --> 15:15.827
Just being publicly ridiculed.

15:16.767 --> 15:17.993
How about some coffee?

15:18.500 --> 15:19.522
Sure.

15:22.697 --> 15:23.754
Hey, Doug.

15:24.096 --> 15:27.856
John, glad you showed up. This kid's
elbow's the size of a grapefruit.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.083
Sure, just give me one second.

15:30.327 --> 15:31.314
Yeah.

15:31.726 --> 15:33.588
l'll just go through my mail.

15:38.056 --> 15:39.578
-Sorry, Lydia.
-Oh, don't be.

15:39.788 --> 15:42.776
That's the best kiss
l've experienced in months.

15:42.987 --> 15:44.611
-Find someone to cover you?
-No.

15:44.819 --> 15:47.045
Keep trying. Mom won't
start supper till 7.

15:47.251 --> 15:49.478
She's really looking forward
to seeing you.

15:49.683 --> 15:51.807
-l'll try.
-l gotta go, but...

15:53.048 --> 15:55.206
-...l'll see you.
-Bye.

15:57.213 --> 15:58.644
All yours.

16:01.478 --> 16:03.033
So what's your name?

16:03.609 --> 16:05.131
My name is John Carter.

16:07.707 --> 16:10.399
You've grown awfully quiet,
John Carter.

16:14.638 --> 16:16.159
Oh, l see.

16:18.768 --> 16:20.097
l had a friend once.

16:20.401 --> 16:23.331
We would go to lunch,
happy hours...

16:23.532 --> 16:24.929
...shopping.

16:26.465 --> 16:29.623
Over drinks one night,
l told her about myself.

16:30.229 --> 16:33.216
She stood up, left the table...

16:33.427 --> 16:35.619
...and never spoke to me again.

16:37.958 --> 16:40.616
l used to feel those things
made me stronger...

16:41.123 --> 16:42.816
...more sure of who l was.

16:44.022 --> 16:45.647
These days...

16:46.587 --> 16:50.018
...l spend three hours putting
on my face before l dare go outside.

16:50.485 --> 16:52.643
Plucking and waxing.

16:53.217 --> 16:55.444
And even then,
someone always notices.

16:55.949 --> 16:58.436
l can see by the look
in their eyes.

17:00.447 --> 17:01.776
The disgust.

17:06.711 --> 17:08.175
Maybe they're right.

17:10.175 --> 17:12.231
Maybe l am disgusting.

17:15.138 --> 17:17.501
Turn your head the other way, please.

17:18.570 --> 17:19.797
Thank you.

17:21.435 --> 17:22.424
Hey, Lydia!

17:23.435 --> 17:25.060
Hey, Al. What you got?

17:25.268 --> 17:27.233
Guy needs to be cleared for booking.

17:27.433 --> 17:29.796
He's bleeding all over my squad car.

17:30.332 --> 17:33.455
-Dr. Ross, got a patient.
-l'm not a ''grownup'' doctor.

17:33.663 --> 17:37.059
We all know that, but there's
no one else available.

17:40.126 --> 17:41.114
What happened?

17:41.326 --> 17:43.950
-He was attacked by a turkey.
-A turkey?

17:44.391 --> 17:45.855
-What's open?
-Trauma One.

17:46.057 --> 17:48.215
Francis is an animal-rights nut.

17:48.423 --> 17:49.853
-Activist.
-Whatever.

17:50.055 --> 17:52.849
There's this Thanksgiving
display in one of the malls.

17:53.054 --> 17:55.916
Dried corn, straw,
guys dressed like Pilgrims.

17:56.118 --> 17:59.105
They also got this live,
big mother of a turkey--

17:59.317 --> 18:02.770
They were exploiting the bird.
lt was disgusting.

18:02.981 --> 18:05.208
So Francis decides
to steal the bird.

18:05.414 --> 18:06.470
To rescue it!

18:06.680 --> 18:09.803
You grabbed the bird, threw it
in your car and took off.

18:10.011 --> 18:12.441
-That's stealing.
-lt was being abused.

18:12.643 --> 18:14.232
Now comes the good part.

18:14.442 --> 18:16.737
During the getaway,
the turkey attacks him.

18:17.241 --> 18:21.466
lt starts clawing and pecking at
his head. So what does Francis do?

18:24.137 --> 18:26.659
He breaks the bird's neck!

18:29.868 --> 18:33.889
And the upshot of it is, you guys
get a fresh bird for your party.

18:34.132 --> 18:35.825
Oh, my God!

18:36.031 --> 18:37.724
You better take that outside.

18:39.063 --> 18:41.119
ls that a Narragansett tom?

18:42.495 --> 18:44.016
lt sure is!

18:44.227 --> 18:45.487
He's a big fella too.

18:45.693 --> 18:48.851
l kind of doubt if Dietary
will want to prepare it.

18:49.058 --> 18:53.147
l'll do it. l used to pluck birds
as a kid. This one's a beaut.

18:56.354 --> 18:59.749
He was listing all the symptoms
of a major depression.

18:59.952 --> 19:01.679
That explains a few things.

19:01.884 --> 19:03.974
l know you've never liked Div, but...

19:04.184 --> 19:06.546
...please don't run him down
in front of me.

19:06.749 --> 19:07.873
Sorry.

19:08.514 --> 19:11.070
lt just hurts to see him like this.

19:11.346 --> 19:12.868
l don't know what to do.

19:13.078 --> 19:15.634
lf he's depressed,
he needs psychiatric help.

19:16.011 --> 19:18.567
l don't want to back him
into a corner.

19:18.776 --> 19:21.206
Someone's gotta say something.
lf he's that bad...

19:21.408 --> 19:23.702
...he shouldn't be treating patients.

19:24.174 --> 19:27.660
Your concern for Div is touching.
Thanks for the advice.

19:27.871 --> 19:31.427
-l just think he should see someone.
-l got that.

19:33.635 --> 19:36.691
You should've seen the
condition of his cage.

19:37.066 --> 19:38.361
lt was like a cell.

19:38.566 --> 19:40.656
His water dish was dry.

19:40.864 --> 19:42.489
That's no good.

19:43.164 --> 19:46.787
People forget that we share
the same biological heritage...

19:46.995 --> 19:50.050
...as every creature on the planet.
That first lizard...

19:50.260 --> 19:53.713
...who crawled out of the ooze
is a distant cousin to us all.

19:53.924 --> 19:55.219
l never thought about it.

19:55.423 --> 19:58.252
You don't keep your cousin
in a cage with no water.

19:58.456 --> 20:00.511
You don't eat your family.

20:00.721 --> 20:01.879
Oh, my God!

20:03.486 --> 20:05.212
Could you please...

20:05.418 --> 20:06.815
...shut the blind?

20:07.817 --> 20:09.214
Sure, Francis.

20:17.845 --> 20:18.868
Are you okay?

20:21.544 --> 20:23.270
Doctor, can l tell you something?

20:26.142 --> 20:28.538
When l was under attack...

20:30.272 --> 20:34.895
...my most primitive fight-or-flight
instinct kicked in...

20:35.103 --> 20:36.500
...and l was a beast!

20:36.703 --> 20:39.633
When l grabbed the bird's neck
and heard it snap...

20:42.633 --> 20:45.154
...there was a part of me...

20:45.365 --> 20:47.227
...that secretly enjoyed it.

20:52.061 --> 20:53.924
ls your father still living?

20:54.726 --> 20:56.248
Yes, he is.

20:57.759 --> 21:01.314
l didn't really know my dad
until just a few years ago.

21:02.490 --> 21:05.420
l hadn't seen him for ten years,
when out of the blue...

21:06.054 --> 21:07.383
...he called.

21:07.787 --> 21:09.376
Said he wanted to see me.

21:10.152 --> 21:11.878
He had no idea.

21:13.584 --> 21:16.174
So l put on a jade-green...

21:16.548 --> 21:18.945
...short-sleeved silk dress.

21:19.547 --> 21:21.671
And that's how l answered the door.

21:22.412 --> 21:23.435
Know what he said?

21:26.410 --> 21:28.841
He said,
''Are you Henry's girlfriend?''

21:30.275 --> 21:32.001
And l said, ''No, Dad.

21:33.107 --> 21:34.265
lt's me.''

21:35.039 --> 21:36.299
And he said...

21:38.571 --> 21:40.933
...''You look just like your sister.''

21:43.102 --> 21:46.726
Then he said he came to see me
because he was dying.

21:47.400 --> 21:50.159
Before he died, he said,
''Henry...

21:50.531 --> 21:52.689
...you may wear a dress...

21:54.496 --> 21:56.461
...but you're still my son.''

21:58.960 --> 22:02.447
l'm done. You should stay here
for about a half-hour...

22:02.658 --> 22:06.952
...to make sure there's no reaction
to the antibiotics. Dr. Greene.

22:09.354 --> 22:10.649
Good morning, ma'am.

22:11.287 --> 22:14.514
-What kind of thread you using?
-4-0 absorbable sub-Q.

22:14.719 --> 22:16.775
Nice apposition, well spaced.

22:17.217 --> 22:18.274
Good job.

22:18.883 --> 22:20.075
Thanks.

22:23.114 --> 22:24.205
Bravo.

22:36.541 --> 22:37.529
Thank God.

22:37.940 --> 22:40.132
God? There is no God, lady.

22:40.338 --> 22:42.326
When can l get the hell out of here?

22:42.871 --> 22:44.460
Very soon.
lt took some doing...

22:44.670 --> 22:47.464
...but l talked the clinic
into taking you back.

22:47.668 --> 22:49.599
Who asked you?

22:50.567 --> 22:52.225
Your appointment is Tuesday.

22:52.766 --> 22:53.788
l ain't going.

22:56.997 --> 22:58.292
Mr. Luck...

22:58.862 --> 23:00.225
...if you don't go...

23:00.429 --> 23:03.326
...you'll come back here,
and neither of us wants that.

23:03.493 --> 23:04.481
Shove it!

23:04.859 --> 23:07.881
-Excuse me?
-Are you deaf too? l said, shove it...

23:08.091 --> 23:10.454
...you little pinheaded puke!

23:19.719 --> 23:22.343
Excuse me. l'm trying to find my son.

23:22.550 --> 23:25.208
-What's his name?
-Andrew Bohlmeyer.

23:25.416 --> 23:28.471
-Andy.
-Yes. ls he all right?

23:28.681 --> 23:31.873
He was taken to surgery.
They're removing his spleen.

23:32.079 --> 23:33.305
Oh, my God!

23:33.512 --> 23:35.772
-l'll take you up.
-Please.

23:40.574 --> 23:42.596
-Edie!
-Andrea, l went by the house!

23:42.807 --> 23:46.964
-l was out. Where are they?
-Where's the other boy? Larry Parks?

23:47.171 --> 23:49.761
-Are you Larry's mother?
-Yes. Where is he?

23:51.769 --> 23:52.961
What?

23:53.901 --> 23:55.491
Mrs. Parks...

23:56.167 --> 23:59.097
...your son was brought in
with injuries to his head--

23:59.298 --> 24:00.990
Are you telling me...

24:01.563 --> 24:02.926
...he's dead?

24:03.562 --> 24:05.618
Yes, he is. l'm sorry.

24:19.321 --> 24:21.718
l am not a baby, for God's sake.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.975
Can't you just put it in my mouth?

24:24.185 --> 24:27.411
Hospital policy, Mr. Luck.
l'll be back in ten minutes.

24:27.617 --> 24:30.775
Wait a minute. How about a
little privacy here?

24:36.479 --> 24:38.035
What's so funny?

24:38.245 --> 24:41.368
You never seen a guy get his
temperature taken before?

24:48.439 --> 24:49.564
Andy....

24:52.038 --> 24:53.560
How you doing, honey?

24:54.104 --> 24:55.126
Tired.

24:56.236 --> 24:58.666
-Numb.
-You're not in any pain?

24:58.835 --> 24:59.822
No.

25:00.367 --> 25:02.355
The girl, is she okay?

25:02.566 --> 25:04.031
No, she's not.

25:04.864 --> 25:06.830
How did it happen, honey?

25:08.929 --> 25:11.553
Larry ran a red light.

25:11.761 --> 25:13.783
He was trying to beat it.

25:15.093 --> 25:17.557
l told him to stop, but...

25:18.157 --> 25:19.679
...he said he could make it.

25:20.624 --> 25:22.213
Oh, Andy.

25:24.054 --> 25:25.383
How awful.

25:30.618 --> 25:32.208
Sweetie.

25:33.583 --> 25:35.571
Thank God you're all right.

25:41.346 --> 25:43.334
l never said you were boring.

25:43.545 --> 25:44.601
You implied it.

25:44.811 --> 25:48.741
You're an extremely dynamic individual,
especially in those glasses.

25:48.942 --> 25:50.873
-What's wrong with them?
-Nothing.

25:51.074 --> 25:52.630
Going to surgery.

25:54.373 --> 25:56.428
ln college, every Friday night...

25:56.638 --> 26:00.568
...l'd go to the Rathskeller
and drink lots of beer. Pitchers!

26:01.102 --> 26:04.430
You're right. l've never done
anything irresponsible.

26:04.634 --> 26:07.497
-lrresponsible is overrated.
-l've never been arrested.

26:07.699 --> 26:11.221
l've never spent money on something
that l didn't need.

26:11.431 --> 26:15.088
And l have never been to Bermuda
with a horny saleslady.

26:15.295 --> 26:18.691
lt's the Bahamas, and l wouldn't
go if she weren't paying.

26:18.893 --> 26:21.483
-She's paying?
-She pays for everything.

26:21.692 --> 26:23.351
l feel like a kept man.

26:23.557 --> 26:26.386
l have never been a kept man.

26:26.922 --> 26:31.114
Dr. Greene! She came in with chest pain,
collapsed in the waiting room.

26:31.321 --> 26:33.149
How long have you been in pain?

26:33.352 --> 26:36.215
An hour. l was in the kitchen,
cooking dinner...

26:36.418 --> 26:38.110
...and the pressure started here.

26:38.317 --> 26:41.372
-ls it a heart attack?
-l'm not sure. Have you been sick?

26:41.582 --> 26:44.274
l was diagnosed with lupus last year.

26:44.480 --> 26:46.104
She's been in remission.

26:46.612 --> 26:48.839
Call Cardiology.
We need to get a consult.

26:49.045 --> 26:52.873
Get an EKG, cardiac enzyme
and a chest film.

26:53.076 --> 26:56.437
-Sir, you'll have to wait outside.
-No! l want him here.

26:56.807 --> 26:58.238
All right. All right.

26:58.439 --> 27:00.132
Here we go. Sit down.

27:00.339 --> 27:03.235
Lie back.
Just relax, breathe easy.

27:03.437 --> 27:05.299
We're gonna take care of you.

27:06.569 --> 27:09.557
He told you he was driving
and you didn't tell anyone?

27:09.767 --> 27:11.460
Who am l supposed to tell?

27:11.666 --> 27:13.461
The police, for one.

27:14.032 --> 27:18.587
Carol, the kid committed manslaughter.
He killed two people.

27:19.329 --> 27:21.385
l'm not sure it's my place.

27:22.594 --> 27:24.320
Well, you know how it is.

27:25.059 --> 27:27.615
Patients think they're dying
and tell us things...

27:27.824 --> 27:31.050
...they wouldn't tell their husbands
or wives. Or their priests.

27:31.789 --> 27:34.447
This kid unburdened his soul to me.

27:36.220 --> 27:38.810
l just don't feel right
passing that on.

27:49.680 --> 27:50.667
Mark.

27:52.245 --> 27:54.607
You guys moonlighting
as cardiologists?

27:54.810 --> 27:57.707
Gurunian and Bell are in surgery,
Kayson's on his way.

27:57.909 --> 27:59.840
Until he gets here, we're it.

28:01.240 --> 28:04.636
Patient's 40, history of lupus,
treated with prednisone.

28:04.839 --> 28:08.395
Presented with chest pain,
heart rate's 1 1 2, pulsus paradoxlus.

28:08.603 --> 28:11.397
EKG shows an ST elevation.
Think there's an effusion?

28:11.602 --> 28:13.226
l do. Sarah?

28:13.434 --> 28:15.694
Well, there's the silhouette sign.

28:16.033 --> 28:18.793
-Blood pressure's dropping.
-She needs a centesis.

28:18.998 --> 28:20.463
-Ever done one?
-Lots of times.

28:20.664 --> 28:23.822
-She's unconscious.
-Move her to Trauma. We can't wait.

28:24.029 --> 28:26.755
l'll need an 1 8-gauge
PC needle and clip.

28:26.960 --> 28:28.085
What's happening?

28:28.293 --> 28:31.849
There's a thin sack around the
heart called the pericardium.

28:32.058 --> 28:36.317
Your wife's is filling with fluid,
so the heart can't beat properly.

28:36.523 --> 28:38.987
We'll insert a needle
and drain the fluid--

28:39.188 --> 28:41.346
-Stick a needle in her heart?
-Near her heart.

28:41.553 --> 28:42.848
You know, Sarah...

28:43.052 --> 28:45.949
...l've never done
one of these procedures...

28:46.150 --> 28:47.911
...and since you've done a lot--

28:48.116 --> 28:49.741
You want to do it?

28:50.215 --> 28:52.578
Do it. l'll back you up.

29:01.909 --> 29:03.238
Hey.

29:06.474 --> 29:07.904
That's funny.

29:08.772 --> 29:10.737
l was just thinking about you.

29:10.938 --> 29:12.403
Pleasant thoughts?

29:12.871 --> 29:14.268
Very pleasant.

29:15.569 --> 29:16.864
Have a seat.

29:20.666 --> 29:22.188
Actually...

29:25.930 --> 29:28.588
...l feel like l owe you an apology.

29:30.428 --> 29:34.586
l know that lately l've been
difficult, to put it mildly.

29:36.325 --> 29:38.381
l'm sorry if l've embarrassed you.

29:39.057 --> 29:40.954
You haven't embarrassed me.

29:42.188 --> 29:43.915
l'm worried about you.

29:44.387 --> 29:45.909
Well, l've been...

29:46.119 --> 29:47.880
...pretty depressed.

29:49.551 --> 29:51.812
Have you thought about...

29:52.017 --> 29:53.675
...talking to someone?

29:54.115 --> 29:55.444
A therapist?

29:56.348 --> 29:59.074
Things are starting
to fall into place.

30:00.346 --> 30:01.868
l wouldn't worry too much.

30:03.278 --> 30:04.708
Are we still on for dinner?

30:04.910 --> 30:08.238
With your sister and her new beau?
l wouldn't miss it.

30:09.907 --> 30:12.168
Maybe we can talk afterwards.

30:12.373 --> 30:13.565
l'd like that.

30:25.633 --> 30:27.120
Mrs. Parks?

30:29.364 --> 30:31.591
Can l get you anything?
Call you a ride?

30:31.796 --> 30:33.421
What?

30:33.629 --> 30:35.957
No. lf l...

30:36.195 --> 30:38.682
-...could just sit down.
-Sure. Sure.

30:39.725 --> 30:41.315
l just saw my son.

30:42.858 --> 30:44.413
He was so cold.

30:52.352 --> 30:54.180
l looked at his face...

30:54.685 --> 30:56.673
...and all l wanted to do...

30:57.583 --> 30:59.105
...was to slap him.

31:01.148 --> 31:04.408
To hit him and to say...

31:04.647 --> 31:06.770
...''You stupid boy!

31:08.178 --> 31:11.007
How could you do this...

31:11.910 --> 31:13.670
...to yourself?

31:13.875 --> 31:15.635
That poor girl.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.628
How could you leave me?''

31:22.304 --> 31:23.633
Oh, my God!

31:25.235 --> 31:26.825
What's wrong with me?

31:36.663 --> 31:39.718
-You seen my patient? Middle-aged....
-She-male?

31:40.828 --> 31:42.725
Must've gone to the ladies room.

31:48.990 --> 31:53.387
lnsert the needle at about 45 degrees,
gently aspirating as you go.

31:53.921 --> 31:56.442
When you reach the pericardium,
you'll draw fluid.

31:56.653 --> 31:59.515
The EKG will let you know
if you touch the heart.

32:03.183 --> 32:05.273
l gotta be getting close.

32:06.715 --> 32:07.839
Anything?

32:08.014 --> 32:09.001
No.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.574
Pull back!
You've hit heart muscle.

32:13.778 --> 32:15.800
What's going on?
Nothing's coming out.

32:16.009 --> 32:19.996
The pericardium must be infected.
The fluid's too thick for the needle.

32:21.040 --> 32:22.471
She's fibrillating.

32:24.938 --> 32:26.369
Charging.

32:27.504 --> 32:29.662
-Ready.
-Clear!

32:32.468 --> 32:33.932
-Got a pulse.
-Let's crack her.

32:34.134 --> 32:35.962
Crack her and morbidity
increases greatly.

32:36.166 --> 32:38.460
lf we don't release the pressure,
she could die.

32:38.664 --> 32:42.390
Do a window. Make an 8-centimeter
cut at the xiphoid. Do it now.

32:45.961 --> 32:47.153
Okay.

32:47.594 --> 32:50.490
Open the diaphragm.
Cut out a window of pericardium.

32:50.925 --> 32:53.980
Two inches. Not too big
or her heart will jump out.

32:54.190 --> 32:55.779
You can do it. Do it.

32:58.855 --> 33:00.877
That's it. Keep going.

33:01.453 --> 33:03.008
Keep going.

33:06.983 --> 33:08.243
That's it. Suction.

33:11.581 --> 33:12.910
Okay, here it comes.

33:13.646 --> 33:14.634
We got fluid.

33:14.946 --> 33:16.037
We got a beat.

33:16.612 --> 33:17.736
Oh, man.

33:18.111 --> 33:19.099
Pressure's back.

33:19.311 --> 33:23.468
Stitch around the tube. l think
you can take it from here.

33:38.533 --> 33:39.794
Andy?

33:43.598 --> 33:44.688
How are you?

33:46.996 --> 33:48.120
l'm okay.

33:49.794 --> 33:51.623
Police talk to you yet?

33:52.693 --> 33:54.056
They will.

33:56.025 --> 33:57.251
Andy...

33:58.623 --> 34:01.087
...l heard what you told your mother.

34:01.788 --> 34:03.844
And l understand why.

34:04.287 --> 34:07.275
You're in a lot of pain.
You don't want to bring on more.

34:11.384 --> 34:14.746
ls it fair to let Larry's mother
believe he killed that girl?

34:17.914 --> 34:21.469
l know you feel guilty,
but it's only gonna get worse.

34:21.678 --> 34:22.835
l know.

34:26.010 --> 34:29.031
l've kept things from people.
lt makes you hate yourself.

34:29.241 --> 34:31.603
lt makes it hard to live
with yourself.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.697
Ever kill anyone before?

34:39.502 --> 34:40.489
No.

34:45.965 --> 34:48.362
But l've done things to hurt people.

34:48.563 --> 34:49.757
People close to me.

34:51.097 --> 34:52.255
And you told them?

34:53.195 --> 34:54.751
Not everything, no.

34:56.393 --> 34:58.120
lt's not so easy.

34:59.559 --> 35:00.581
ls it?

35:05.489 --> 35:08.181
-What's going on?
-Jumper on the roof. Some lady.

35:08.387 --> 35:10.250
Looks like she's gonna go.

35:12.819 --> 35:13.841
Oh, God!

35:17.849 --> 35:18.837
Excuse me.

35:19.049 --> 35:20.309
She's my patient.

35:22.280 --> 35:23.506
Miss Carleton!

35:23.746 --> 35:24.734
Please.

35:25.612 --> 35:26.703
Please.

35:26.911 --> 35:28.399
-Don't come any closer.
-Okay.

35:28.678 --> 35:29.665
Okay.

35:34.207 --> 35:37.694
Miss Carleton, l know you're
feeling terrible right now...

35:40.438 --> 35:41.733
...but there's people...

35:42.003 --> 35:44.661
...in the hospital that can help you.

35:45.669 --> 35:48.156
l can't pass for a woman anymore.

35:53.765 --> 35:55.854
That's all l've ever wanted to be.

35:56.063 --> 35:59.721
Could you just look at me?
Just look at me and talk to me.

36:00.994 --> 36:02.425
We could talk about it.

36:06.858 --> 36:09.220
-Carter.
-Oh, thank God!

36:10.722 --> 36:12.983
Like to introduce me to your friend?

36:13.354 --> 36:15.114
Miss Carleton...

36:15.487 --> 36:18.008
...there's a doctor here
who can help you.

36:20.384 --> 36:22.815
ls it okay if he talks--
No! Don't!

36:23.082 --> 36:24.809
Oh, God!

36:44.205 --> 36:46.795
That looks good.
This is really good--

36:48.004 --> 36:49.060
Party time!

36:56.932 --> 36:59.090
Hey, Haleh, pass the yams, please.

36:59.297 --> 37:02.285
lt's a buffet.
Get your own yams.

37:06.361 --> 37:09.053
-You heard about the--
-Yeah, awful.

37:09.259 --> 37:11.588
-Any luck getting off?
-No.

37:13.390 --> 37:14.878
Can we take a walk?

37:15.989 --> 37:16.977
Sure.

37:27.483 --> 37:29.380
-Ready?
-Ready as l'll ever be.

37:29.582 --> 37:31.240
Here's your ticket.

37:32.280 --> 37:33.337
Oh, my God!

37:34.146 --> 37:35.509
These are coach.

37:36.278 --> 37:37.403
Hold on.

37:39.610 --> 37:41.166
Oh, to be a kept man.

37:41.376 --> 37:43.897
Not one complaint out of you.

37:44.108 --> 37:46.901
ln an hour you'll be at the table
with your wife...

37:47.106 --> 37:49.570
...your daughter and your
family all around.

37:49.771 --> 37:53.531
And l'm gonna be at 30,000 feet
sucking down vodka gimlets...

37:53.736 --> 37:55.394
...with a woman who dresses me.

37:55.602 --> 37:57.590
You have no idea how lucky you are.

37:57.801 --> 37:59.789
lf you don't want to go, don't go.

38:00.433 --> 38:01.728
A little late for that.

38:01.932 --> 38:03.692
-l don't know.
-Here she comes.

38:03.898 --> 38:06.328
All fixed.
The limo's waiting.

38:06.530 --> 38:09.824
-Well, Happy Thanksgiving.
-Okay. Happy Thanksgiving.

38:10.428 --> 38:11.518
Bye.

38:32.482 --> 38:34.743
So is this good news...

38:35.048 --> 38:36.071
...or bad?

38:38.846 --> 38:39.833
Oh, boy.

38:40.545 --> 38:42.635
l need to talk to you
about something.

38:43.010 --> 38:43.998
What?

38:46.875 --> 38:49.272
During the time that we've
been going out...

38:52.172 --> 38:54.001
...l slept with Doug Ross.

38:57.404 --> 38:58.494
When?

38:59.402 --> 39:00.867
Last winter.

39:02.967 --> 39:04.864
Before you took the pills?

39:05.300 --> 39:06.287
Yeah.

39:09.264 --> 39:10.422
Since then?

39:11.763 --> 39:12.785
No.

39:16.394 --> 39:18.018
But two weeks ago...

39:19.991 --> 39:21.479
...he kissed me and l let him.

39:29.320 --> 39:30.308
Tag, please.

39:30.519 --> 39:32.984
Just go to hell, okay?
Just go to hell!

39:33.218 --> 39:37.205
Am l supposed to sit back and smile
while you screw your old boyfriend?

39:37.416 --> 39:39.142
What more do you want from me?

39:39.348 --> 39:41.643
l've been patient.
l've been faithful.

39:41.847 --> 39:44.005
Should l treat you like garbage,
like Doug?

39:44.213 --> 39:45.200
No.

39:45.579 --> 39:46.805
l want you.

39:48.410 --> 39:50.035
Why would you tell me this?

39:50.242 --> 39:53.264
Because l've been dishonest,
and l need you to know.

39:53.475 --> 39:56.598
Okay, great. Now l know, okay?
l know!

39:56.939 --> 39:59.200
What am l supposed to do now, okay?

40:01.670 --> 40:03.192
Tag.

40:08.799 --> 40:10.264
Hey, Sarah.

40:10.798 --> 40:11.786
Yeah?

40:14.330 --> 40:17.954
The heart lady's doing fine.
She'll be with her family tomorrow.

40:18.162 --> 40:19.286
Good.

40:21.527 --> 40:24.650
-You start the fellowship next week?
-l leave tomorrow.

40:24.825 --> 40:25.813
Yeah.

40:26.991 --> 40:29.717
-l'm sure you'll be just great.
-Probably.

40:29.922 --> 40:30.979
See you.

40:31.188 --> 40:32.653
Sarah?

40:34.154 --> 40:35.176
l....

40:37.619 --> 40:39.345
Thanks, you know...

40:39.651 --> 40:41.240
...for...

40:42.016 --> 40:45.208
...letting me do the procedure...

40:45.414 --> 40:48.038
...and backing me up
when things got crazy today.

40:48.346 --> 40:51.505
This is a teaching hospital.
Helping those under you...

40:51.711 --> 40:55.369
...looking out for each other,
that's what it's supposed to be about.

40:56.609 --> 40:57.596
Yeah.

41:00.540 --> 41:02.334
lt was a great save.

41:04.538 --> 41:06.469
l'll see you in the spring.

41:31.324 --> 41:32.483
Carter...

41:34.655 --> 41:37.313
...if anybody's responsible, it's me.

41:40.853 --> 41:44.306
She came in here because she crashed
her car into a bridge.

41:49.081 --> 41:52.205
l should've recognized that
as a suicide attempt...

41:52.413 --> 41:54.072
...but l didn't.

41:55.412 --> 41:58.604
So next time, we'll both
be more attentive.

42:10.870 --> 42:12.631
Come on, Carter. Let's go.

42:14.901 --> 42:15.889
What?

42:16.167 --> 42:18.394
My family's holding
dinner until 7:30.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.326
lf we hurry,
we'll catch the prayer.

42:21.565 --> 42:24.462
Thank you, Dr. Benton.
l just want to be alone.

42:24.729 --> 42:28.387
You promised my mother, didn't you?
You're gonna back out?

42:30.860 --> 42:33.257
Come on. Grab your coat.
Let's go.

42:34.991 --> 42:36.547
Let's go, Carter.

43:03.110 --> 43:04.735
Come and get it!

43:05.609 --> 43:08.471
Ronnie, come on.
Turn off the damn TV.

43:08.941 --> 43:12.961
-l guess we shouldn't wait for Div.
-You snooze, you lose. l'm starving.

43:19.802 --> 43:22.665
Chloe, how long did you
cook this turkey?

43:22.866 --> 43:24.695
l don't know. A couple hours.

43:24.899 --> 43:28.058
A turkey this size needs
at least six hours.

43:28.697 --> 43:30.628
Try some. lt tastes good.

43:30.829 --> 43:33.260
lt's teeming with bacteria.

43:33.494 --> 43:35.755
l'll put it back.
Maybe we can eat at ten.

43:35.960 --> 43:39.515
-Maybe Div'll be here by then.
-Wait. You gotta be kidding.

43:40.491 --> 43:42.149
You can't read a cookbook?

43:42.357 --> 43:44.947
Why don't you shut up?
All you did was watch TV.

43:45.522 --> 43:48.510
That's what l do on Thanksgiving.
That is Thanksgiving.

43:48.720 --> 43:52.310
Besides, who bought the groceries?
Who bought the beer?

43:52.519 --> 43:53.949
-With my money!
-Shut up!

43:54.151 --> 43:56.446
You act like two-year-olds.

44:27.200 --> 44:28.460
Come on.
