WEBVTT

00:03.300 --> 00:05.480
I've come to get you, Princess.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.810
Who might you be?

00:07.810 --> 00:09.620
My apologies...

00:09.620 --> 00:12.360
I'm the leader of one of the 
Round Table's eleven guilds.

00:12.900 --> 00:16.160
Shiroe, of Log Horizon.

00:16.630 --> 00:20.750
And I'm Michitaka, of the Marine Agency.

00:21.420 --> 00:25.130
Crusty, of D.D.D.

00:26.110 --> 00:27.600
Crusty?

01:58.800 --> 02:01.010
What do you want?

02:01.360 --> 02:04.880
I'm having an important discussion 
with Princess Lenessiaâ€”

02:04.880 --> 02:07.060
That's why we're here, as well.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.470
I'm told the princess made a mistake.

02:11.750 --> 02:14.080
She was asked to prepare warehouses for you,

02:14.080 --> 02:17.100
but she lost your letter, 
or forgot it, or something?

02:17.100 --> 02:20.280
Regardless, she messed up, 
and trouble has arisen from it.

02:20.920 --> 02:23.240
This is quite a problem, isn't it, Princess?

02:24.570 --> 02:28.370
I'm told that the cargo consists 
largely of food and spices?

02:28.370 --> 02:31.670
And that, if left outside, they'll spoil quickly?

02:32.170 --> 02:35.760
What a problem you've caused, Princess.

02:37.330 --> 02:39.740
Shiroe, you don't need to put it like that...

02:40.570 --> 02:44.600
And this Round Table represents Akihabara?

02:44.910 --> 02:48.910
Then a mistake made by the granddaughter

02:48.910 --> 02:52.160
of Eastal's leader, their ally,

02:52.160 --> 02:54.820
is something you'll take responsibility for, yes?

02:56.400 --> 02:58.590
The Round Table has nothing to do with this!

02:58.590 --> 03:01.000
It was strictly my...

03:02.270 --> 03:06.550
Actually, Lord Malves, your letter 
was received by the Round Table.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.730
That's impossible!

03:10.460 --> 03:12.410
<b>Please ensure warehouses are 
secured for the above goods 
during my stay in Akihabara.</b>

03:10.920 --> 03:14.040
Th-This is my signature!

03:14.240 --> 03:15.720
What's wrong?

03:15.720 --> 03:20.380
You seem as surprised as though 
you'd never even sent a letter.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.820
Then that letter...

03:23.820 --> 03:25.680
Shiroe probably...

03:26.370 --> 03:29.860
N-Never mind the letter! 
What of the warehouses?

03:29.860 --> 03:32.110
Are they ready?!

03:32.110 --> 03:33.380
Oh, no...

03:33.380 --> 03:38.230
I'm told that the Round Table's trade 
warehouses are already full...

03:38.230 --> 03:41.470
My ship has five hundred tons of cargo!

03:41.470 --> 03:43.450
Are you saying you can arrange

03:43.450 --> 03:47.740
a temperature-controlled warehouse with 
that kind of capacity immediately?

03:47.960 --> 03:50.170
Well, Michitaka?

03:50.170 --> 03:52.870
It's true that the warehouses are full...

03:53.910 --> 03:56.650
The Round Table's warehouses, anyway.

03:56.650 --> 03:57.880
However...

03:58.260 --> 04:04.220
The Marine Agency's warehouses can hold 
five thousand tons as easily as five hundred.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.700
If you like, I can also lend you carts.

04:07.420 --> 04:10.130
Then, let's get everything moved.

04:11.550 --> 04:13.260
What's wrong?

04:13.260 --> 04:16.240
You aren't going to tell me there isn't any cargo,

04:16.640 --> 04:20.280
and this was all a plot against 
the princess, are you?

04:21.900 --> 04:24.780
I'm sorry... That was a bad joke.

04:25.150 --> 04:30.070
A nobleman of the proud Holy 
Empire Westelande would never

04:30.880 --> 04:32.660
do a thing like that.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.700
I feel unwell!

04:39.270 --> 04:42.140
Um, I really am...

04:42.140 --> 04:43.720
If you're thanking someone, thank Shiroe.

04:45.480 --> 04:47.680
This was just something I dealt with on the side.

04:48.130 --> 04:50.150
Then, shall we go?

04:52.010 --> 04:53.390
On the side?

04:53.700 --> 04:54.810
I told you, right?

04:55.950 --> 04:57.810
That I've come to get you.

04:59.820 --> 05:05.740
<b>The Scale Festival</b>

05:01.820 --> 05:03.370
The Scale Festival.

05:12.330 --> 05:13.830
Okay, here we go!

05:14.700 --> 05:18.790
We will now begin the Akihabara 
Autumn Collection Fashion Show!

05:27.630 --> 05:31.700
This is much nicer than the 
stage inside the building.

05:32.360 --> 05:35.270
This was a great idea, Shiro...

05:35.710 --> 05:37.050
Very clever!

05:38.530 --> 05:40.110
Now, come on, Akatsuki.

05:40.110 --> 05:42.150
Smile. Smile!

05:51.740 --> 05:52.850
My lord...

05:56.340 --> 05:57.810
Hey, is that...

05:57.810 --> 05:59.190
...Princess Lenessia?

05:59.190 --> 06:00.510
It's the princess!

06:00.510 --> 06:01.710
The princess...

06:04.990 --> 06:06.740
There's no need to kneel.

06:07.170 --> 06:10.620
Tonight, Princess Lenessia is here

06:10.620 --> 06:13.720
to enjoy the festival with all of you.

06:14.550 --> 06:18.530
For security reasons, she can't leave this couch.

06:19.020 --> 06:23.860
But she's said she'll greet anyone 
who wants to say hello.

06:24.390 --> 06:28.360
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, 
so take advantage of it!

06:28.360 --> 06:30.870
Seriously? I don't know if I feel worthy...

06:31.380 --> 06:33.180
Oh, fine...

06:33.180 --> 06:34.540
We'll be the first ones up!

06:34.540 --> 06:35.860
Yeah!

06:36.570 --> 06:39.760
Crusty was so cool back there.

06:39.760 --> 06:44.250
But that Shiroe guy was so creepy...

06:44.250 --> 06:46.650
He was mean to the princess.

06:46.650 --> 06:47.910
Yeah.

06:53.350 --> 06:56.450
Looks like the enemy's attempts 
to confuse us have ceased...

06:57.020 --> 07:00.520
Does that mean Malves was the 
mastermind behind it, after all?

07:01.340 --> 07:04.910
Though, given how he acted, I don't 
know if I can call him a "mastermind."

07:06.130 --> 07:07.140
Shiroe...

07:07.500 --> 07:08.530
Minori?

07:10.290 --> 07:12.200
You did well today.

07:12.200 --> 07:13.030
Thanks.

07:13.710 --> 07:15.040
S-Sure!

07:17.530 --> 07:19.390
U-Um...

07:20.730 --> 07:24.410
Aren't you going to say hello 
to Princess Lenessia?

07:25.700 --> 07:29.920
The Round Table's other guild 
masters are already there.

07:30.200 --> 07:33.350
I just saw her, anyway.

07:34.050 --> 07:37.560
I've already done my job here, too.

07:37.560 --> 07:38.810
Your job?

07:39.150 --> 07:41.310
You're so cute!

07:41.640 --> 07:44.060
There, there, there, there...

07:45.370 --> 07:46.440
What's going on?

07:46.440 --> 07:48.410
Did Marie do something?

07:50.470 --> 07:53.320
Did you do that deliberately?

07:54.480 --> 07:58.200
Did you deliberately make 
Princess Lenessia dislike you?

08:00.620 --> 08:02.710
Yeah... I did.

08:03.710 --> 08:08.630
Sometimes, having both good cop 
and bad cop is for the best.

08:09.290 --> 08:12.130
In the princess's case, Crusty is the good cop.

08:16.500 --> 08:19.430
<i>Then he really is doing it all deliberately.</i>

08:19.730 --> 08:23.660
Especially when you have an 
aggressive plan to carry out.

08:24.990 --> 08:26.540
Are you okay with that?

08:27.600 --> 08:32.110
Oh, you're worried that people might 
dislike Log Horizon, not just me?

08:32.610 --> 08:34.230
I can talk to the chief about...

08:34.230 --> 08:35.530
That's not it!

08:35.810 --> 08:38.990
Doesn't it hurt you?!

08:42.130 --> 08:44.980
I've never thought about it.

08:45.460 --> 08:46.630
But... I see.

08:47.190 --> 08:49.260
I guess it would look that way.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.300
You really helped me out this time.

08:56.180 --> 09:01.320
You did more than ten others 
in your place could have.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.650
It's the same thing.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.090
Something needs to be done, and you can do it.

09:08.450 --> 09:11.280
If that's what people want from 
you, I think it's a good thing.

09:13.570 --> 09:16.570
I was afraid of even making a guild.

09:17.480 --> 09:18.740
But I realized...

09:19.740 --> 09:22.280
Being strong on your own is meaningless.

09:22.970 --> 09:25.710
To use your power, you need other people.

09:26.220 --> 09:29.410
And you need a world where 
they can all be at their best.

09:31.350 --> 09:34.150
And if there's something I can do for that world,

09:34.150 --> 09:36.590
I'll work at least as hard as you.

09:37.590 --> 09:40.930
I'll do my best, so I don't cause you problems.

09:43.690 --> 09:44.980
Shiroe...

09:50.780 --> 09:55.230
Did you deliberately make 
Princess Lenessia dislike you?

09:56.650 --> 09:58.090
<i>I didn't know...</i>

09:59.150 --> 10:02.620
Doesn't it hurt you?!

10:03.500 --> 10:05.000
<i>I didn't realize...</i>

10:05.990 --> 10:11.250
You did more than ten others 
in your place could have.

10:13.670 --> 10:15.590
<i>I was with him the whole time.</i>

10:17.370 --> 10:18.510
<i>And I...</i>

10:31.890 --> 10:33.140
Ooshima?

10:33.140 --> 10:34.280
Where are you?

10:34.970 --> 10:37.960
Ooshima won't be here tonight.

10:39.300 --> 10:41.110
You are Shiroe, correct?

10:41.110 --> 10:42.570
I am Dariella.

10:42.570 --> 10:45.410
One of the People of the Land 
and a traveling author.

10:46.300 --> 10:50.670
Ooshima is tied up with something 
right now, and unable to come.

10:50.920 --> 10:54.670
<b>Dariella 
Race/ Human 
Chronicler, Lv. 13 
Second-class Citizen</b>

10:51.290 --> 10:54.670
So I'll tell you about Minami instead.

10:55.820 --> 10:58.170
I've never heard of that spell.

10:58.740 --> 11:00.300
What kind of disguise is that...

11:00.950 --> 11:02.000
Nureha?

11:09.720 --> 11:13.000
How could you tell, Shiro?

11:15.290 --> 11:19.070
You shouldn't have been aware of Overlay,

11:20.360 --> 11:23.710
my information-control spell, yet.

11:23.710 --> 11:24.830
Intuition.

11:25.690 --> 11:26.820
Intuition?

11:28.000 --> 11:30.850
Well, I won't inquire further.

11:30.850 --> 11:34.590
But I'm happy you knew my name.

11:31.580 --> 11:34.590
<b>Nureha 
Race/ Fox Tail 
Enchanter, Lv. 90 
Plant Hwyaden Guild Master</b>

11:35.030 --> 11:37.840
You're the ruler of the west, after all.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.720
I'm not a ruler.

11:41.280 --> 11:43.690
That doesn't change the fact 
that you're the leader.

11:44.340 --> 11:49.230
Even if you've left Intex, Mizuha, 
and Zeldus in charge.

11:50.500 --> 11:55.980
The guild that oversees the western 
city, Minami, is Plant Hwyaden.

11:56.830 --> 12:00.910
And its guild master, who controls 
the west, is Nureha.

12:02.820 --> 12:05.070
Soon after the Apocalypse, you won the favor

12:05.070 --> 12:09.780
of the People of the Land's nobility in Minami, 
and even made its guards your servants.

12:09.780 --> 12:14.240
Then you used the nobility's wealth 
to buy the Cathedral.

12:15.250 --> 12:18.250
Where dead adventurers revive.

12:19.810 --> 12:24.370
You gained enormous authority as well 
as the very lives of the adventurers,

12:24.370 --> 12:26.020
and then you declared

12:26.850 --> 12:31.630
that every adventurer in Minami 
had to join Plant Hwyaden.

12:33.690 --> 12:38.430
I'm told it's a town with only one guild, 
so there's no discrimination among guilds.

12:39.300 --> 12:40.530
Isn't it wonderful?

12:41.440 --> 12:44.410
So what brings you to Akihabara?

12:44.830 --> 12:49.150
I've come to invite you to join Plant Hwyaden.

12:49.650 --> 12:51.160
To be next to me...

12:52.000 --> 12:53.670
To walk with me...

12:54.060 --> 12:56.170
And to protect me.

12:56.560 --> 12:57.590
Why?

12:57.590 --> 12:58.920
Exactly as I said...

13:00.300 --> 13:02.470
I want you.

13:02.850 --> 13:06.680
I've known about you for a long, long time.

13:07.550 --> 13:10.390
Yes, I know everything.

13:10.680 --> 13:14.390
Including your creation of 
a new magic at Zantleaf.

13:14.390 --> 13:16.940
I could say the same of you.

13:17.430 --> 13:18.680
They're still unstable,

13:18.680 --> 13:21.500
but you restarted the transport 
gates between cities, right?

13:22.240 --> 13:25.950
You really do know everything, don't you?

13:26.410 --> 13:29.090
Was it your order that all information 
from the west be cut off?

13:29.500 --> 13:32.540
That was something Mizuha did.

13:32.540 --> 13:35.960
And the disturbances aimed at the Round Table?

13:35.960 --> 13:38.590
One of Malves's ideas that got out of hand.

13:39.560 --> 13:42.460
You dealt with it splendidly.

13:43.360 --> 13:45.490
You knew about it, and you did nothingâ€”

13:48.910 --> 13:51.780
Won't you come with me?

13:53.100 --> 13:54.500
You won't?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.020
None of what you're saying is true.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.490
If I tell the truth, will you?

14:02.000 --> 14:03.780
I can't say until you tell me.

14:05.580 --> 14:08.030
Then I'll tell you.

14:09.290 --> 14:12.760
Though I assure you the truth is nothing good.

14:13.320 --> 14:16.540
But you're special.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.800
I was a plain woman...

14:23.830 --> 14:28.050
I was plain and never stood out, 
as though I were no more than air.

14:28.850 --> 14:31.160
No one even remembered my name.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.040
No one cared if I was there or not.

14:35.500 --> 14:39.310
And then I discovered <i>Elder Tale</i>.

14:40.480 --> 14:43.940
I thought that, here, someone might notice me.

14:44.740 --> 14:48.130
Someone might need me.

14:48.690 --> 14:52.530
But it was no different than reality.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.320
No matter where it goes, air is still air.

14:58.250 --> 14:59.080
However...

15:00.110 --> 15:03.390
One person noticed me.

15:04.710 --> 15:08.220
He told me I was a talented player.

15:09.280 --> 15:13.850
He told me he respected how I played solo.

15:14.610 --> 15:18.300
He was an enchanter, like I am.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.610
That enchanter couldn't be...

15:25.780 --> 15:28.360
That's a lie. I made it all up.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.280
No way. But...

15:30.280 --> 15:31.540
Shiro...

15:31.990 --> 15:35.740
Shiro, aren't you on the verge of finding it?

15:36.070 --> 15:39.760
Fraction... A way to go home.

15:42.030 --> 15:45.050
You really are special, Shiro!

15:46.410 --> 15:49.930
A means of going back to our 
own world has been discovered.

15:50.360 --> 15:53.470
I can't prove that it's a way back yet.

15:53.800 --> 15:55.980
Only that it can make someone disappear.

15:57.420 --> 16:02.400
Don't you think that if you worked 
with me, you could prove it?

16:03.730 --> 16:05.890
If you came with me,

16:05.890 --> 16:10.400
you'd have access to far more information 
than you'll find in Akihabara...

16:10.750 --> 16:13.180
And you could use the People of the Land's

16:13.180 --> 16:15.780
money and power in any way you liked.

16:17.180 --> 16:20.360
I think it's the best way for 
you to find a way home,

16:20.360 --> 16:26.080
the best thing for all this world's adventurers.

16:28.560 --> 16:29.550
Also,

16:30.030 --> 16:33.880
you don't actually have a reason at all, do you?

16:34.180 --> 16:35.170
A reason?

16:35.170 --> 16:36.050
That's right...

16:36.570 --> 16:39.040
A reason to help Akihabara,

16:39.040 --> 16:42.440
or a reason to help the People of the Land.

16:42.440 --> 16:45.560
All you have is a vague sense of ethics.

16:46.050 --> 16:49.250
Isn't that painful for you?

16:51.010 --> 16:55.830
Then why not make me your reason?

16:55.830 --> 17:00.210
You can use me as your excuse 
to do whatever you want.

17:01.550 --> 17:05.080
I'll do anything for you.

17:05.510 --> 17:07.090
Whatever you wish.

17:07.630 --> 17:10.340
Whatever you need...

17:10.720 --> 17:13.220
I shall give it to you.

17:15.310 --> 17:16.340
Why?

17:16.750 --> 17:19.470
Because I want you.

17:19.840 --> 17:23.100
So make me your reason...

17:24.560 --> 17:26.750
Make me your excuse...

17:29.820 --> 17:30.890
My reason...

17:34.840 --> 17:36.160
Shiro?

17:36.690 --> 17:38.560
I have a reason now.

17:38.980 --> 17:40.790
And I can't make it an excuse.

17:41.620 --> 17:45.040
If I do that, everything will turn into a lie.

17:46.090 --> 17:48.290
Everything we've worked so hard to build.

17:49.080 --> 17:53.010
So I can't make someone into an excuse!

17:54.700 --> 17:58.120
I'll believe every one of the "lies" you told me.

17:58.940 --> 18:01.370
However, I'm sorry...

18:01.370 --> 18:03.510
I don't remember you.

18:05.180 --> 18:09.350
But if I ever did tell you that you had talent,

18:09.350 --> 18:10.820
I can't use you as an excuse.

18:12.330 --> 18:14.140
And I can't go with you...

18:14.140 --> 18:16.320
Why not, Shiro?

18:17.220 --> 18:21.560
I can give you what you want more 
easily as a foe than a friend.

18:22.770 --> 18:26.740
I'll be your enemy, whenever you 
decide to find a reason.

18:30.650 --> 18:34.840
Now I want you even more, Shiro...

18:35.710 --> 18:37.560
Someday...

18:39.070 --> 18:41.290
You will be mine.

18:44.860 --> 18:46.320
Okay, this way!

18:46.710 --> 18:48.340
Two or three more signs coming!

18:48.340 --> 18:49.850
This is quite a sight.

18:49.980 --> 18:52.770
At last, it's the finale.

18:52.770 --> 18:55.050
It's kind of sad.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.990
I feel so exhausted, so desolate...

18:59.230 --> 19:02.050
Do you know what "desolate" means?

19:03.440 --> 19:06.520
I want to have another festival someday, Marielle!

19:06.520 --> 19:07.870
Th-That's right.

19:07.870 --> 19:10.130
We'll have to hold one in winter!

19:10.420 --> 19:12.810
Christmas, New Year's Eve, and New Year's.

19:13.270 --> 19:14.880
Also, Setsubun and the Doll Festival!

19:15.310 --> 19:17.540
There's Boy's Day, too.

19:17.850 --> 19:20.140
A-And the obon dance...

19:20.460 --> 19:22.620
You want to have festivals all year round?

19:23.070 --> 19:24.140
Jeez.

19:24.140 --> 19:25.990
They sure are taking it easy.

19:25.990 --> 19:30.240
Well, there's nothing wrong with a 
festival like this once in a while.

19:30.550 --> 19:33.020
Anyway, the city really has grown...

19:33.670 --> 19:37.030
Hard to believe it all started with 
a hamburger that had some flavor.

19:46.230 --> 19:47.520
You seem down.

19:47.520 --> 19:48.910
What's wrong, shrimp?

19:49.950 --> 19:51.250
It's nothing.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.420
Really?

19:53.560 --> 19:56.580
Do you want to discuss something, Shiroe?

19:57.410 --> 19:58.420
Why?

19:58.930 --> 20:02.720
If you want, you can give us the order.

20:03.090 --> 20:04.300
Order?

20:05.040 --> 20:07.310
After all, you're the guild master.

20:08.090 --> 20:11.900
You're the one who made the city into what it is.

20:12.460 --> 20:15.680
Lots of people know that.

20:16.310 --> 20:18.760
They believe in you.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.920
So you can take them with you,

20:23.920 --> 20:26.210
down whatever path you follow.

20:29.610 --> 20:30.710
Chief...

20:31.220 --> 20:35.210
I don't know what you want to discuss, 
but if it's a fight, leave it to me!

20:35.760 --> 20:38.860
Then, I'll act as your resplendent rear guard.

20:39.240 --> 20:40.470
Everyone, just relax andâ€”

20:40.470 --> 20:42.740
Look, there's sauce on your shirt, Rudy.

20:42.740 --> 20:43.340
What?!

20:43.950 --> 20:47.110
Whether it's a quest or whatever, 
I'll handle it, Shiroe!

20:47.500 --> 20:48.970
I'll do my best, too!

20:49.830 --> 20:50.850
Everyone...

20:51.500 --> 20:52.410
My lord...

20:53.410 --> 20:55.980
I'll be with you forever, my lord.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.550
I'm counting on you, Akatsuki.

21:00.460 --> 21:04.470
If it's a quest, I hope we get some cool items...

21:04.470 --> 21:07.960
Like a giant treasure chest filled with panâ€”

21:09.810 --> 21:13.130
My lord, may I knee this pervert in the face?

21:13.590 --> 21:15.580
Let me finish my last syllable!

21:18.870 --> 21:22.680
So what are we really doing, Shiroe?

21:23.270 --> 21:25.690
Rebuilding the other towns?

21:26.220 --> 21:30.060
Why not make the entire Yamato 
island chain gorgeous?

21:31.240 --> 21:35.020
No matter what we do, 
we need to raise our levels.

21:39.400 --> 21:43.400
Perhaps we should go back to our own world?

21:45.160 --> 21:47.990
No, we're doing something bigger.

21:49.520 --> 21:51.540
Hey, Shiro... Something bigger?

21:53.300 --> 21:55.480
Everyone, listen to me.

21:56.600 --> 21:59.170
Log Horizon's next goal is...

21:59.740 --> 22:00.670
Leave it to me.

22:01.170 --> 22:01.840
Right!

22:02.520 --> 22:03.670
It's the end for you.

22:08.460 --> 22:11.930
<i>The MMORPG</i> Elder Tale...

22:13.520 --> 22:18.610
<i>One day, tens of thousands 
of players were trapped</i>

22:19.260 --> 22:21.370
<i>within a world that looked just like it.</i>

22:25.140 --> 22:27.200
<i>Right now, this is our world.</i>

22:29.680 --> 22:30.990
<i>This is our reality.</i>

22:32.410 --> 22:33.480
<i>From here...</i>

22:34.290 --> 22:36.200
<i>We will change the world.</i>

24:08.420 --> 24:11.570
I've been waiting for you, Shiroe.

24:11.570 --> 24:12.470
Actually...

24:13.420 --> 24:15.880
I've decided to leave Akihabara.

24:18.750 --> 24:21.550
May I accompany you?

24:21.980 --> 24:29.990
<b>Log Horizon</b>

24:21.980 --> 24:29.990
<b>Season 2 
Airing this fall!!</b>

24:23.060 --> 24:26.710
All of you adventurers in front of 
the TV, this is big, big news!
