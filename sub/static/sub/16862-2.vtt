00:01.560 --> 00:03.020
Previously on "rescue me"...

00:03.030 --> 00:05.030
Made my decision.

00:05.740 --> 00:08.900
I'm gonna leave the fdny.

00:09.750 --> 00:11.320
Maggie,we've been married 9 months.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.330
What are you talking about,

00:12.370 --> 00:13.940
"breathing life into the relationship"?

00:14.060 --> 00:15.330
Everyone needs breath.

00:15.400 --> 00:16.810
Everyone needs a spark,sean.

00:16.910 --> 00:19.920
Ok,and the spark is by watching
some chick get double-teamed

00:20.000 --> 00:22.260
by guys with cocks the
size of telephone poles?

00:22.340 --> 00:23.480
***

00:23.520 --> 00:24.240
Who?

00:24.300 --> 00:25.200
Tony.

00:25.210 --> 00:26.360
Yeah,he's my boyfriend.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.410
I'm pretty sure that
she's banging this guy.

00:28.530 --> 00:29.240
I know.

00:29.940 --> 00:31.050
Look,she's on the pill.

00:31.110 --> 00:32.439
You put her on the pill?

00:32.520 --> 00:33.850
I got a girl.

00:33.890 --> 00:35.260
Really?

00:35.320 --> 00:38.020
She's in a wheelchair...

00:38.170 --> 00:40.460
but she's got the sweetest ass.

00:40.470 --> 00:44.150
Coming through the probie class right
now is a black kid-- afro-american,

00:44.220 --> 00:47.720
as kramer might say--who is so
goddamn good as an outside shooter,

00:47.780 --> 00:49.680
people are calling him
the next jackie ryan.

00:49.730 --> 00:50.540
What?

00:50.640 --> 00:53.780
You know,how come you
never ask me about my day?

00:53.840 --> 00:55.430
Listen,you got to get
me the hell out of here.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.390
My wife,she's driving me nuts.

00:57.430 --> 01:00.930
You mark my words,once I'm sprung,
she'll lose all interest in me.

01:01.000 --> 01:01.800
That's her M.O.

01:01.880 --> 01:03.280
How you doin',kid?

01:03.340 --> 01:04.420
I'm engaged.

01:04.459 --> 01:05.510
You're kiddin'.

01:05.580 --> 01:06.440
Nope.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.150
Who's the lucky girl?

01:08.220 --> 01:10.130
Steven--my
boyfriend.

01:10.140 --> 01:11.670
I didn't put my papers in.

01:11.720 --> 01:12.360
Hmm?

01:12.420 --> 01:13.200
Things changed.

01:13.260 --> 01:15.490
Things stayed the
same,but they changed.

01:24.630 --> 01:25.900
I bought this for us.

01:25.960 --> 01:27.790
I--you think I
wanted this,huh?

01:27.810 --> 01:31.300
Is that what you think,
you son of a bitch?!

01:31.450 --> 01:33.360
Shit!

01:33.400 --> 01:34.020
Oh!

01:34.100 --> 01:34.850
Tommy!

01:34.890 --> 01:35.660
Tommy!

01:35.690 --> 01:37.300
Wake up!

01:38.690 --> 01:40.810
The word on the street
is you're going to jail.

01:40.890 --> 01:41.890
I don't know what street that is,

01:41.960 --> 01:43.630
but that's the wrong street,
'cause I'm not going to jail.

01:43.690 --> 01:45.660
I'm just saying--
That's not what I hear.

01:45.670 --> 01:46.940
I got a friend down at H.Q.

01:46.950 --> 01:49.070
He says they're this close
to getting rid of you.

01:49.080 --> 01:49.660
I'm telling you,

01:49.740 --> 01:52.360
I think I would remember-- You
don't remember starting the fire.

01:52.420 --> 01:54.970
How the hell can we expect you to
remember signing the go the goddamn policy?

01:55.050 --> 01:56.340
I didn't start the fire,ok?

01:56.410 --> 01:57.840
Listen to me.

01:59.900 --> 02:02.340
We've got $2 million on the line,

02:02.400 --> 02:05.200
and you are totally screwing this up.

02:11.280 --> 02:14.480
Look,I knew you wouldn't
sign the policies yourself.

02:14.560 --> 02:17.250
But I knew that it was
the right thing to do.

02:17.310 --> 02:20.790
Thank god I did it,
considering the circumstances.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.860
You're stuck with a newborn
child and two other kids,tommy.

02:24.920 --> 02:26.090
Listen,we get this money,

02:26.150 --> 02:30.950
you are never gonna have to worry about
anything else ever again,all right?

02:31.020 --> 02:37.710
Colleen's college tuition,katy's
college,a trust fund for the baby.

02:38.180 --> 02:40.460
Janet can get her own house.

02:40.620 --> 02:46.570
The insurance payoff is gonna
be,like,close to $2 million.

02:46.650 --> 02:48.660
And,um...

02:48.720 --> 02:50.750
we can cut that right down the middle.

02:50.790 --> 02:53.910
I got an offer on the
land where the house was.

02:53.970 --> 02:56.060
400 grand.

02:56.120 --> 02:58.160
I don't want your money.

02:59.730 --> 03:05.550
You're not gonna do anybody any good
sitting in prison,you big dum-dum.

03:05.610 --> 03:06.580
What the--what
are you doing?

03:06.700 --> 03:08.670
You had a little,
like,baby stink on you.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.720
And anyway,it's curious,
by britney spears.

03:10.800 --> 03:11.600
It's fancy.

03:11.670 --> 03:12.730
Well,the Well,the mystery's over.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.400
She's a whore,ok?

03:14.440 --> 03:20.540
I want to know what really
happened that night,ok?

03:20.620 --> 03:21.870
All of it.

03:21.930 --> 03:24.550
You know the truth,tommy.

03:24.630 --> 03:29.260
You're an uncontrollable alcoholic
with a heavy case of survivor's guilt.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.760
A couple of big swigs,your guilt goes
right out the window,bing,bang,zoom--

03:32.820 --> 03:35.940
you're whipping off my panties
and whipping out your dick.

03:35.980 --> 03:40.660
I saw something about it on
"oprah"--the whole grieving process?

03:40.740 --> 03:45.270
That's how men deal with death--
they want to have a lot of sex.

03:45.340 --> 03:48.510
They think it kills off
all the emotions inside.

03:48.590 --> 03:49.570
Oprah said that?

03:49.670 --> 03:51.360
She did.

03:52.220 --> 03:54.510
What,did you buy all
new stuff for this place?

03:54.560 --> 03:55.770
Yeah,I did.

03:55.820 --> 03:57.280
I went to this place on fifth avenue.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.310
I mean,you can't fill
a manhattan apartment

03:59.410 --> 04:01.260
with all the same stuff
that you had in bay ridge.

04:01.310 --> 04:03.680
So what,did you spend,like,
the rest of the widow money?

04:03.710 --> 04:05.930
I needed a place to live.

04:05.950 --> 04:07.540
I needed a change.

04:07.600 --> 04:08.570
Damien's at nyu.

04:08.650 --> 04:09.580
I wanted to be close to him.

04:09.630 --> 04:11.650
Besides which,we pull this off,

04:11.690 --> 04:15.650
this apartment is just
the tip of the iceberg.

04:15.710 --> 04:16.940
What are you doing?

04:17.000 --> 04:18.910
I want the truth.

04:19.529 --> 04:21.750
Ho ho ho!

04:21.829 --> 04:23.440
That bowl...

04:23.520 --> 04:25.030
cost me 5 grand.

04:25.090 --> 04:25.690
-Really?
-Yeah.

04:25.970 --> 04:26.820
Mm-hmm.

04:26.870 --> 04:28.000
What about this?

04:28.080 --> 04:30.430
Listen,I told you the truth already.

04:30.500 --> 04:31.740
Ooh!

04:31.820 --> 04:33.510
Look,you can destroy this
whole goddamn apartment.

04:33.590 --> 04:35.740
It's not gonna make a
shit lick of a difference.

04:35.810 --> 04:36.590
Oh.

04:36.650 --> 04:37.310
Oh,no.

04:37.350 --> 04:38.600
Oh,no,no,no!

04:38.610 --> 04:40.050
Give me that!
Give me that!

04:40.060 --> 04:40.620
No,no,no,no!

04:40.720 --> 04:41.310
Give me that...

04:41.400 --> 04:43.090
Nope.

04:43.170 --> 04:44.570
I want the whole truth.

04:44.610 --> 04:46.230
Ok!

04:52.320 --> 04:53.590
God!

04:54.830 --> 04:57.190
Ooh...

05:00.420 --> 05:02.690
You were sober--

05:03.780 --> 05:06.290
you were sober when you first came over.

05:06.380 --> 05:07.830
***

05:07.910 --> 05:12.910
I remember breaking the news
to you,I remember you...

05:12.960 --> 05:17.370
getting pissed off,and I remember...

05:17.400 --> 05:19.080
watching the meerkats.

05:19.120 --> 05:21.190
You were more interested in
the meerkats than my feelings.

05:21.260 --> 05:25.510
That's such a bunch
of bull-- Anyhoo!

05:25.590 --> 05:27.650
We watched the meerkats
for-- I don't know--like,

05:27.690 --> 05:29.850
minutes or something; I
wasn't really paying attention.

05:29.930 --> 05:33.440
And then,that's when I realized...

05:33.490 --> 05:38.160
that apparently,this entire time...

05:38.270 --> 05:40.960
you were making drink
after drink for yourself.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.300
Actually,you weren't
even making drinks;

05:42.370 --> 05:44.980
you were just pouring these huge
glasses of vodka for yourself.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.070
I thought that you were drinking water.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.690
And then,the next thing I know...

05:49.750 --> 05:55.330
you were all over me,
and it was getting...

05:55.410 --> 05:57.380
really hot.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.260
And then...

06:00.560 --> 06:01.560
What?

06:01.630 --> 06:03.480
You couldn't get it up.

06:03.520 --> 06:05.430
I tried everything.

06:05.490 --> 06:06.120
I did.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.980
And then,the more I
tried,the madder you got.

06:09.060 --> 06:13.440
And then you flipped out,
and then you picked up this,

06:13.520 --> 06:15.670
like,vase or
something--I don't know--

06:15.750 --> 06:18.700
and hit the gas lantern
antiquey thing that I bought.

06:18.780 --> 06:23.340
And so I ran upstairs to go
get the fire extinguisher...

06:23.400 --> 06:28.790
and then I heard this--
this huge explosion,

06:28.890 --> 06:30.700
and you came running
up the stairs to get me,

06:30.770 --> 06:35.660
and then I saw you--I saw you
fall backwards down the stairs.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.290
So...

06:38.670 --> 06:40.730
you're telling me...

06:41.710 --> 06:43.910
you tried everything?

06:45.350 --> 06:46.700
Even the...

06:47.010 --> 06:50.450
tongue thing that you sometimes do?

06:50.530 --> 06:52.380
I tried it...

06:53.170 --> 06:54.580
twice.

06:55.140 --> 06:56.190
I got to go.

06:56.270 --> 06:57.190
No,wait.

06:57.220 --> 06:58.170
I--wait.

06:58.250 --> 06:59.030
Where are you going?

06:59.140 --> 07:00.020
I got to talk to eddie.

07:00.100 --> 07:02.030
My hearing's in,like,an hour.

07:02.090 --> 07:05.040
I'll call you when we decide
which story we're gonna use.

07:05.070 --> 07:06.550
Christ.

08:03.370 --> 08:04.630
It's not that funny.

08:04.730 --> 08:06.670
Oh,no,it's not just
funny,man,it is brilliant.

08:06.680 --> 08:08.550
Shh. What,huh? Brilliant how?

08:08.560 --> 08:12.070
Because,I am telling you,
this is manna from heaven.

08:12.130 --> 08:15.030
Well,I know it's good,but--
No,no,no,listen,listen.

08:15.070 --> 08:17.990
Every time you been in there,
you been feeding them this...

08:18.030 --> 08:21.400
convoluted couple of tales of alcohol

08:21.470 --> 08:23.280
and passing out and it's
all pretty suspicious.

08:23.290 --> 08:23.820
Mm-hmm.

08:23.830 --> 08:26.180
Right,but this-- god damn,
this is perfect,you know?

08:26.250 --> 08:29.170
First,it tells how
the fire started,right?

08:29.480 --> 08:31.330
Right.It was truly accidental.
-Yeah.

08:31.370 --> 08:35.330
Second,it shows you doing your dead-level
best to save her,which goes to character.

08:35.419 --> 08:38.650
And third,it gives a plausible reason
why you didn't want to confess to the truth

08:38.690 --> 08:40.850
in the first place--the fact
that you couldn't get it up.

08:40.919 --> 08:41.520
Shh.

08:41.620 --> 08:46.360
Your limp,lifeless little dick
might actually save your a your ass.

08:48.850 --> 08:51.080
Works fine now.

08:56.810 --> 08:57.740
5 more minutes,jerry.

08:57.800 --> 08:58.840
It's lookin' good.

09:06.170 --> 09:07.880
Hey,ma.

09:08.710 --> 09:10.450
How you feelin'?

09:10.520 --> 09:12.300
You look good.

09:12.340 --> 09:14.100
Oh,look who's here again.

09:14.210 --> 09:15.550
Oh,hey,marlene.

09:15.630 --> 09:18.870
Oh,and look at the
balloons and the flowers.

09:18.950 --> 09:20.620
You're a lucky woman,mrs. Silletti,

09:20.660 --> 09:23.500
to have such a sweet
boy to take care of you.

09:24.200 --> 09:25.520
I have to shift her now.

09:25.570 --> 09:28.540
She's got significant skin breakdown.

09:28.560 --> 09:30.210
You can wait outside.

09:30.260 --> 09:32.360
Oh,I'll stay.

09:32.400 --> 09:33.850
It's quite painful,michael.

09:33.890 --> 09:35.480
I'm not sure you want to be here.

09:35.520 --> 09:37.190
No,I'm not leaving her.

09:37.250 --> 09:38.920
Michael.

09:38.970 --> 09:40.370
I'll stay.

09:40.410 --> 09:41.980
Ok.

09:42.770 --> 09:44.780
Here we go,mrs. Silletti.

09:46.830 --> 09:48.940
-Ohhh...
-Ok.

09:55.360 --> 09:56.290
Which one is he?

09:56.350 --> 09:58.420
Number 11,do-rag.

10:02.760 --> 10:04.640
-Whoo,shit.
-Yes.

10:04.690 --> 10:05.660
Kid's the second coming,isn't he?

10:05.720 --> 10:08.340
Yeah,he's the black jackie ryan.

10:08.380 --> 10:09.830
Why can't he just be a kick-ass baller

10:09.910 --> 10:12.640
without being the black
version of some old white guy?

10:12.680 --> 10:14.430
'Cause I'm a lieutenant.
I get to say what I want.

10:14.520 --> 10:17.210
I could have said he was "the
chocolate jackie ryan," but I didn'T.

10:17.290 --> 10:19.490
Jesus,even basketball
makes you think of chocolate.

10:19.550 --> 10:20.740
No,basketball makes
me think of pumpkin,

10:20.790 --> 10:23.710
which makes me think of pie,which
makes me think of whipped cream.

10:23.780 --> 10:25.920
This probie makes me think of chocolate.

10:25.970 --> 10:27.220
Oh.

10:27.300 --> 10:28.590
Man,he does have all the skills.

10:28.650 --> 10:31.970
Yes,he does,and everyone out here
just licking their lips for him.

10:32.030 --> 10:35.860
Look,murph the surf,75 truck.

10:35.890 --> 10:37.590
Jimmy the jew from 66.

10:37.670 --> 10:41.450
Hey,you know,I thought jimmy was
famous for,like,hating jewish guys.

10:41.530 --> 10:42.800
Oh,gotcha.

10:42.830 --> 10:44.730
We're gonna have to make
this kid a serious offer.

10:44.770 --> 10:45.770
Yeah,like what?

10:45.780 --> 10:46.320
I don't know.

10:46.330 --> 10:51.080
You know,no grunt work-- no sweeping
the floors,no cleaning up the shitter.

10:51.140 --> 10:53.520
Nah,nah,tommy ain't gonna go for that.

10:53.530 --> 10:54.400
Well,you know what?

10:54.480 --> 10:56.810
If we want a winning hoops team again,
we're gonna have to pay the price.

10:56.890 --> 10:59.100
They're gonna offer this kid the world.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.530
Shit,the last time murph pulled a
hot shooter out of the probie school,

11:01.610 --> 11:04.850
the kid didn't even see his
first fire for,like,6 months.

11:04.940 --> 11:05.550
Ok,now,look.

11:05.610 --> 11:07.780
Laugh,put your arm around me
like I said something funny.

11:07.850 --> 11:08.350
What?

11:08.410 --> 11:08.940
Come on,he's coming right over here.

11:08.990 --> 11:10.660
I want to promote racial
harmony in the house.

11:10.710 --> 11:11.410
Come on,quick.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.710
All right,promise me I don't have to
clean the kitchen after dinner next shift.

11:13.710 --> 11:14.880
-Blow me.
-All right.

11:14.890 --> 11:16.940
No kitchen deal,no racial harmony.
Here he comes.

11:16.970 --> 11:18.330
Ok,ok,ok.

11:18.370 --> 11:20.970
-Fat-ass irish donkey.
-You sneaky little spic.

11:24.210 --> 11:25.270
Hello?

11:25.320 --> 11:27.150
Franco,it's me.

11:27.190 --> 11:28.080
High-five me.

11:28.160 --> 11:29.950
Uh,hey,what's going on,man?

11:30.030 --> 11:31.900
I need you to come get me.

11:32.000 --> 11:33.170
Go low.

11:33.220 --> 11:35.980
Uh,richie,I'm a little
bit busy right now.

11:36.040 --> 11:41.440
And I also need $2,000. 4.

11:41.540 --> 11:42.280
What?

11:42.340 --> 11:44.410
Where are you?

11:51.300 --> 11:55.460
Oh,what?Is it impossible for you to
put your own lunch in knapsack?

11:55.520 --> 12:00.670
You know,when I was your age-- You didn't
have backpacks or buses or electricity.

12:00.740 --> 12:02.650
Very funny,smarty pants.

12:02.730 --> 12:03.890
Did you wake up your sister?

12:03.930 --> 12:05.060
She's already gone.

12:05.120 --> 12:07.780
Oh,ok. Good.

12:07.820 --> 12:09.730
So go. Go. Go,go,go.

12:09.740 --> 12:10.810
-Mom?
-Mm-hmm?

12:10.820 --> 12:13.650
Does the new baby hate you?

12:13.730 --> 12:15.320
No,no,of course not.

12:15.380 --> 12:20.260
It's just--he's colicky,
which means-- He pukes a lot.I know.

12:21.270 --> 12:23.050
Can we name him puke face?

12:23.090 --> 12:24.080
No.

12:24.120 --> 12:26.000
Ok,go,go,go.

12:26.040 --> 12:27.180
Go.

12:27.210 --> 12:28.000
Bye,mom.

12:28.050 --> 12:29.410
Bye,puke face.

12:31.780 --> 12:32.820
Hey.

12:32.890 --> 12:34.480
Flying colors,huh?

12:34.530 --> 12:40.810
Well,the doctors have to check all the bells
and whistles,you know-- ekg and blood work.

12:40.870 --> 12:42.680
Someone from headquarters
will give you a call.

12:42.740 --> 12:44.130
Ah,that's great.

12:44.170 --> 12:46.070
Look,I never felt better in my life.

12:46.100 --> 12:48.580
I just had to buy a new
suit for my son's wedding.

12:48.640 --> 12:49.990
Old one's too big.

12:50.050 --> 12:51.340
Good for you.

12:51.380 --> 12:52.750
Congratulations on both fronts.

12:52.790 --> 12:53.810
Mm-hmm.

12:53.870 --> 12:56.390
So do you like his fiancee?

12:56.440 --> 12:57.600
Yeah.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.390
She's a real doll.

12:59.440 --> 13:00.360
Good.

13:00.390 --> 13:03.350
And as I was showing a
customer these rings,your...son?

13:03.380 --> 13:04.260
Brother...

13:04.350 --> 13:06.750
in-law,possibly,in the future.

13:06.810 --> 13:09.230
He grabbed one and
stuck it in his mouth.

13:09.280 --> 13:10.070
Nigger.

13:10.110 --> 13:11.640
Ok,that's it.

13:11.680 --> 13:13.140
Look,I don't care if he is retarded.

13:13.190 --> 13:14.940
If he says that again,we're
gonna have a serious problem.

13:15.010 --> 13:16.190
Sir,I understand,all right?

13:16.250 --> 13:21.100
He's got,like,a tourette's thing going
on and he's a little,you know,slow.

13:21.140 --> 13:22.770
Richie,just please apologize.

13:22.830 --> 13:24.240
No.

13:24.280 --> 13:24.860
Rich.

13:24.930 --> 13:26.410
I want that ring,franco.

13:26.460 --> 13:27.680
Buy me that ring!

13:27.720 --> 13:29.960
That ring costs more than i
make in a goddamn month,rich.

13:29.990 --> 13:32.110
Hey,hey,yo.

13:32.780 --> 13:33.810
I'm sorry.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.650
We can't afford to buy
anything in here,all right?

13:35.690 --> 13:38.970
Now,rich,please,say you're sorry.

13:40.950 --> 13:43.500
I'm very,very sorry I
tried to eat the ring.

13:43.540 --> 13:47.120
And I'm sorry that we
wasted your time tonight,ok?

13:47.160 --> 13:49.120
Come on,rich.

13:49.220 --> 13:50.990
I'm sorry.

13:52.150 --> 13:53.910
Whoa.

13:55.310 --> 13:56.970
That is dope.

13:57.050 --> 13:57.760
Uh,sir,I'm sorry.

13:57.820 --> 14:01.600
Just on a lark,what would something
like that ring right there--

14:01.660 --> 14:02.630
what would that go for?

14:02.690 --> 14:05.470
That would be 37... hundred.

14:06.030 --> 14:06.940
Hundred.

14:07.010 --> 14:10.860
My girlfriend would love that one,too.

14:10.920 --> 14:12.520
Yeah,well,you know,
quite frankly,rich,

14:12.570 --> 14:14.570
we could buy your girlfriend
a beveled glass doorknob

14:14.620 --> 14:16.770
and it'd keep her mollified
for at least a month.

14:16.840 --> 14:18.870
You know where to get one of those?

14:18.930 --> 14:19.850
Yeah.

14:19.890 --> 14:21.090
Come on.

14:25.400 --> 14:26.320
Dr. Lowry?

14:26.410 --> 14:28.400
Oh,mike. Good morning.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.330
Morning.She seems,uh,worse today.

14:30.560 --> 14:32.940
She's--she's
coughing a lot.

14:33.060 --> 14:37.440
Mike,we got the most recent
blood work back and the biopsy.

14:37.480 --> 14:39.120
Yeah?

14:39.190 --> 14:40.820
It's not good.

14:40.900 --> 14:43.180
She's she's got two more
major malignant polyps,

14:43.220 --> 14:46.440
and the lower intestine is
being eaten away very quickly.

14:46.480 --> 14:48.390
We can't remove any more of it.

14:48.430 --> 14:50.740
We could operate again,

14:50.770 --> 14:54.590
but we'd have to operate several
more times over the next few weeks.

14:54.650 --> 14:57.290
Or we could try another round
of aggressive radiation therapy,

14:57.330 --> 15:02.360
which would significantly
weaken her immune system.

15:02.440 --> 15:05.140
I'm afraid that's her best chance.

15:05.200 --> 15:10.220
So,um,she's gonna be fine then?

15:10.280 --> 15:14.700
Ok.Michael,I want you to
listen to me very carefully.

15:15.280 --> 15:17.150
It's not good.

15:17.210 --> 15:24.140
The chances of your mother's
recovery are very,very,very...

15:24.170 --> 15:25.620
slim.

15:27.650 --> 15:30.510
You mean,
like--like...

15:30.570 --> 15:34.010
like slim like when the red sox are
down to the yanks 3 games to zero,

15:34.070 --> 15:37.070
and they're,like,
suddenly-- Slim to none,ok?

15:37.090 --> 15:39.180
Slim to none.

15:39.260 --> 15:41.460
Closer to none.

15:41.500 --> 15:42.760
Much closer.

15:42.830 --> 15:45.050
Wow.

15:45.100 --> 15:47.250
Talk about dropping the bomb.

15:47.290 --> 15:50.170
And that's my mom we're talking
about,not some goddamn baseball team.

15:50.190 --> 15:51.620
I--I know
my mom.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.130
She...

15:53.190 --> 15:55.720
she's like--she's like
the babe ruth of moms.

15:55.760 --> 15:59.550
If anyone can beat cancer,she can.

15:59.890 --> 16:00.820
What?

16:00.860 --> 16:03.880
Mike,babe
ruth--he,uh...

16:03.900 --> 16:06.750
he actually died from cancer.

16:06.810 --> 16:09.020
-Oh.
Yeah,ok.

16:09.040 --> 16:12.160
Look,I'm really sorry,michael.

16:12.220 --> 16:14.050
I'll talk to you later,ok?

16:24.310 --> 16:26.300
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:33.610 --> 16:35.010
How's the coffee?

16:35.090 --> 16:36.640
Coffee's good.

16:36.710 --> 16:40.530
Was that your,um-- That
was--that was my porno,yeah.

16:40.590 --> 16:41.350
Wow.

16:41.410 --> 16:44.050
I just started thinking about
it from your point of view,sean.

16:44.090 --> 16:47.470
And I thought about it and i realized
that I was wrong and you were right.

16:47.530 --> 16:50.430
I was emasculating you in
order to get myself off.

16:50.490 --> 16:54.530
I was injecting my former fantasies
into a present-day relationship.

16:54.610 --> 17:00.660
Totally unfair,totally
unnecessary,'cause I have you.

17:01.180 --> 17:05.170
You are so sweet and gorgeous,
and you're here and now.

17:05.170 --> 17:09.060
So I'm all done with porno.

17:09.130 --> 17:10.430
I'm all yours,sean.

17:10.510 --> 17:13.099
Wow,that's--thank you
so much,maggie,really.

17:13.180 --> 17:16.089
That's just a really nice
gesture on your part,really.

17:16.140 --> 17:16.829
So good.

17:16.839 --> 17:17.359
Ok.

17:17.369 --> 17:20.450
Ok,'cause I was getting sick
of always hiding that box.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.470
Yeah,I was getting
sick of looking for it.

17:22.530 --> 17:24.900
Yeah,and always having
to dust off those dvds.

17:24.930 --> 17:26.500
Can't imagine how dusty they get.

17:26.579 --> 17:27.810
Yeah.

17:27.869 --> 17:30.830
Yeah,so I guess it's back to
the old spank bank for mags.

17:30.890 --> 17:33.180
Hey,honey,did you get my tampons?

17:33.240 --> 17:34.040
Honey,jesus.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.520
Did you just say...

17:35.570 --> 17:37.170
maggie?

17:37.250 --> 17:39.600
Did you just say "spank bank"?

17:39.640 --> 17:41.450
Well,yeah.

17:41.470 --> 17:42.040
Wow.

17:42.050 --> 17:43.830
So you--you actually
have a-- A spank bank?

17:44.070 --> 17:46.430
Yeah,yeah,a huge one.

17:46.490 --> 17:48.520
Oh,I know,I know.

17:48.570 --> 17:51.220
You think only men have spank banks.

17:51.290 --> 17:56.250
But don't forget that I grew up around
tommy,the king of the spank bank.

17:56.330 --> 18:00.370
I learned from the master how to
store up all my eager little fantasies

18:00.450 --> 18:05.420
and then access them in my mind
whenever I feel the need to get off.

18:06.620 --> 18:07.180
Huh.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.090
I haven't done that in a while,though.

18:09.160 --> 18:12.280
Speaking of which,don't you
have somewhere you have to be?

18:12.360 --> 18:15.820
Well,I--no,I--not
at all,really.

18:15.850 --> 18:16.500
What,what?

18:16.580 --> 18:17.820
You don't have a spank bank?

18:17.890 --> 18:19.200
Yeah,of course I have a spank bank.

18:19.260 --> 18:21.390
I'm a guy,but--
So am I in it?

18:21.460 --> 18:22.520
Yeah,yeah,of course.

18:22.560 --> 18:26.160
You're in it in a variety of ways.

18:26.170 --> 18:28.000
What about me?
Am I in yours?

18:28.330 --> 18:30.480
Well,I--I'm gonna be
putting you in this afternoon.

18:30.570 --> 18:34.040
Maggie-- I just said I haven't
been using the goddamn thing!

18:34.070 --> 18:37.530
Sean,sean,sean.Sweetie.Ahem.

18:45.860 --> 18:47.820
I,uh...

18:51.200 --> 18:56.500
I feel,uh,like I'm
better prepared to,uh,

18:56.550 --> 19:03.190
illuminate you about
what went on that night.

19:03.590 --> 19:07.190
And why would that be,mr. Gavin?

19:07.280 --> 19:09.500
Well,um...

19:10.390 --> 19:13.680
you know,I've put--ahem--I've
put some thought into it--ahem.

19:13.760 --> 19:16.400
And I think,um,um...

19:16.500 --> 19:22.160
uh,you know,I'm more capable
of--of presenting the facts.

19:22.240 --> 19:22.900
Perfect.

19:22.990 --> 19:25.120
We are eager to listen.

19:26.000 --> 19:27.470
Um--ahem.

19:27.510 --> 19:30.860
Does she have to be in here?

19:30.870 --> 19:33.020
Yes,she does.

19:33.090 --> 19:35.360
She's the recording secretary.

19:35.410 --> 19:38.500
Please,continue,mr. Gavin.

19:46.810 --> 19:48.360
Hey,tommy,how'd it go in there?

19:48.410 --> 19:50.130
It went fine,all right?

19:50.170 --> 19:52.160
It went fine.

19:54.380 --> 19:56.670
Hey,don't worry about the chick,huh?

19:56.710 --> 19:57.330
All right?

19:57.420 --> 19:58.660
Who's she gonna tell?

19:58.700 --> 20:00.590
15,20 people,tops.

20:00.630 --> 20:03.250
Look,the important thing is
that sheila is backing us up.

20:03.330 --> 20:04.450
We're ready for you.

20:04.520 --> 20:05.540
Now after we get past this thing,

20:05.580 --> 20:08.460
the next fire you have to put out is
the one down at headquarters,all right?

20:08.500 --> 20:09.850
I called down there
about 10 times already.

20:09.860 --> 20:12.440
Nobody's calling me back.
Fdny,man.

20:12.630 --> 20:14.020
Ain't like it used to be.

20:14.060 --> 20:17.180
It's all bea it's all bean
counters and brown nosers now.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.360
Guys like me?Dying breed.

20:19.450 --> 20:20.230
Oh,yeah.

20:20.310 --> 20:21.470
Yeah,with the drinking and the drugging

20:21.550 --> 20:24.590
and the mistresses and the
lying and the cheating,yeah.

20:24.630 --> 20:26.430
World ain't what it
used to be,huh,tom?

20:26.500 --> 20:27.670
Hey,we got to go.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.070
Teddy's jury just came in.

20:29.110 --> 20:30.100
Is that good or bad?

20:30.140 --> 20:33.870
Look,if I had to bet right now on your
case or teddy's,I'd have to call it even.

20:33.930 --> 20:34.610
Why's that?

20:34.660 --> 20:36.460
Because they both
hinge on the same thing.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.170
Which is?

20:37.230 --> 20:40.460
Dead dicks.Ha ha ha!

20:40.790 --> 20:42.600
So,no slide show then,right?

20:42.680 --> 20:43.380
Dad.

20:43.390 --> 20:45.320
Come on.I mean,you were such a cute kid.

20:45.510 --> 20:47.820
Remember when you had that
lead in the elvis musical?

20:47.860 --> 20:48.730
"Bye,bye,birdie.

20:48.780 --> 20:52.380
" Dad-- Yeah,and how about
the junior prom,the beach?

20:52.420 --> 20:54.680
Remember,tommy had that
really,really bad sunburn?

20:54.720 --> 20:57.360
Dad,no slide show.

20:57.440 --> 20:59.370
It's a wedding reception,
not a birthday party.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.290
Just a quick little speech.

21:01.350 --> 21:02.730
Hey!

21:02.800 --> 21:03.500
Ok,I got it.

21:03.550 --> 21:05.820
Who told you to move this shit?

21:05.830 --> 21:06.440
Hey.

21:06.450 --> 21:07.540
Hey,jer,how are you?

21:07.690 --> 21:08.630
Well,I'm doing ok.

21:08.670 --> 21:11.390
I just come back from my stress
test,passed with flying colors.

21:11.390 --> 21:12.900
-That's great.
-Yeah,it's great.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.850
You believe these ...?

21:14.910 --> 21:16.000
What are you standing around for?

21:16.080 --> 21:17.420
Oh,wait,needles.Hold on,guys.

21:17.450 --> 21:18.920
I told them to do that.

21:18.980 --> 21:20.940
It's been just sitting
there for about 5 years.

21:20.990 --> 21:22.160
Nobody's touched it.

21:22.200 --> 21:26.090
Just taking up space,so i figured I'd
put the lockers back where they used to be,

21:26.120 --> 21:28.160
and then I want to take
a couple of-- I touch it.

21:28.200 --> 21:28.900
Huh?

21:28.940 --> 21:30.210
Yeah,me and chief pecker.

21:30.250 --> 21:31.410
We got a
best-of-7 going.

21:31.460 --> 21:32.810
We play between shifts.

21:32.850 --> 21:33.770
I'm up 3-nothing.

21:33.840 --> 21:35.080
Oh.Oh,well,good.

21:35.140 --> 21:37.670
Then I'll just have them throw it down
in the basement so this way you guys-

21:37.730 --> 21:38.860
- No,you see,it's better up here.

21:38.900 --> 21:41.540
That way,if we get a call,
we just jump in the suburban.

21:41.590 --> 21:42.740
You're shittin' me I mean,

21:42.780 --> 21:45.760
you want me to rearrange my rearrangement
because of you two julio fangulios?

21:45.820 --> 21:47.400
Oh,ok.Hey,guys,guys.

21:47.660 --> 21:49.110
Give us a minute,huh?

21:49.150 --> 21:50.770
Thank you.

21:52.950 --> 21:55.090
All right,look,jer,
this is your house.

21:55.150 --> 21:55.710
I know that.

21:55.790 --> 21:58.660
But me and chief pecker,you
got to give us a break here.

21:58.730 --> 21:59.750
What?

21:59.810 --> 22:01.900
Hey,look,we're covering for you,
and we got no problem doing it.

22:01.940 --> 22:04.740
Happy to help,jerry,but
you come waltzing in here,

22:04.790 --> 22:06.140
these guys don't know which way to look.

22:06.220 --> 22:07.370
I mean,it's hard enough
to keep these mugs in line,

22:07.430 --> 22:09.040
but we're doing our best.

22:09.120 --> 22:12.000
You can't keep whacking us
off at the knees like this.

22:12.040 --> 22:13.050
Oh,is that what I'm doing?

22:13.090 --> 22:15.440
I'm just saying,jer-- And I'm
just saying to you,needles,

22:15.500 --> 22:19.290
you just shut your mouth and tell
chief peckerhead to do the same thing.

22:19.340 --> 22:22.490
You want to go and play chief,you
go play in some other goddamn house.

22:22.520 --> 22:23.490
This is my house.

22:23.550 --> 22:26.510
I make the rules,all right?

22:26.560 --> 22:28.600
These are my guys.

22:28.640 --> 22:33.210
I keep these mugs in line,and that's
including you and the other guy.

22:33.270 --> 22:34.960
Now,I'm gonna go upstairs in my office

22:35.010 --> 22:38.120
and get it ready for when I come back
to full duty in a couple of weeks.

22:38.170 --> 22:39.910
You want to make yourself useful?

22:39.970 --> 22:42.200
Go get me a cup of coffee.
Make it black.

22:43.820 --> 22:45.230
Get that piece of shit out of here

22:45.310 --> 22:47.920
and put the lockers
back where I told you to.

22:51.630 --> 22:53.430
Hello?

22:53.450 --> 22:55.260
Yeah, this is she.

22:55.280 --> 22:56.450
Her absence?

22:56.480 --> 22:58.560
When, today?

22:59.460 --> 23:01.620
No, no, that's not possible.

23:01.660 --> 23:03.500
No, I mean, I didn't see her leave for school this morning.

23:03.520 --> 23:04.850
I have a new baby here,

23:04.870 --> 23:08.800
but every other day this week, she's left at her regular time.

23:09.350 --> 23:11.690
3 days?

23:12.570 --> 23:14.600
Ok, thank you.

23:34.660 --> 23:38.230
A victory celebration this morning at the courthouse in lower manhattan,

23:38.250 --> 23:41.760
as 54-year-old theodore gavin is being released.

23:41.780 --> 23:44.880
Gavin's closely watched murder trial ended moments ago

23:44.900 --> 23:47.370
when the jury handed down a not-guilty verdict,

23:47.400 --> 23:52.420
a result influenced in no small part by the very vocal support gavin received

23:52.460 --> 23:54.710
from the mothers against drunk driving.

23:54.740 --> 23:57.510
- Mr. Gavin, how do you feel?
- I feel great!

23:57.530 --> 24:00.110
I want to thank the girls from mothers against drunk driving.

24:00.130 --> 24:02.750
They do nice work, and the first thing I'm gonna do today is

24:02.800 --> 24:04.180
raise a glass in their honor.

24:04.200 --> 24:05.420
Not while driving, of course.

24:05.440 --> 24:08.590
Mr. Gavin, now that you're a free man, what are you looking forward to most?

24:08.610 --> 24:10.360
Oh, I'm looking forward to a lot of things:

24:10.380 --> 24:13.100
A nice, big breakfast, a trip up to aqueduct,

24:13.120 --> 24:15.600
and finally being able to sleep on my stomach again!

24:15.620 --> 24:17.240
See ya!

24:17.830 --> 24:19.170
So how's your thing going, tommy?

24:19.190 --> 24:21.200
Well, I'm waiting to hear, you know?

24:21.230 --> 24:22.770
Good.I hope you don't have to go to jail.

24:22.800 --> 24:25.000
- Yeah, me, too.
- What'd you say that for?

24:25.030 --> 24:26.450
- Hello?
- I'm trying to be nice.

24:26.470 --> 24:27.950
- Hey, it's me.
- What's up?

24:27.970 --> 24:30.540
Hey, colleen hasn't been to school in at least 3 days.

24:30.560 --> 24:31.240
What?

24:31.270 --> 24:33.590
Yeah, and that's not the worst part.
I think she may have run away.

24:33.610 --> 24:35.480
- Why?
- Why?

24:35.500 --> 24:37.750
Oh, let's see.Your affair with her aunt,

24:37.770 --> 24:39.860
your possible jail sentence, your drinking.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.710
Yeah, how about your affair with my brother

24:41.720 --> 24:43.090
and then having an affair with me

24:43.110 --> 24:44.850
while you're having an affair with my brother, huh?

24:44.880 --> 24:46.950
How about that?
Sorry, it's the wife.

24:46.970 --> 24:47.570
You know?

24:47.590 --> 24:49.910
I don't mean "why"-- psychologically, emotionally "why"--

24:49.940 --> 24:51.660
I mean, "why do you think she ran away" why?

24:51.680 --> 24:54.040
Because she emptied out her bra and panty drawer,

24:54.060 --> 24:57.080
and no girl does that unless she's leaving for a long, long time.

24:57.100 --> 24:58.040
Hey.

24:58.060 --> 25:00.240
When a girl takes off and she takes all her bras and panties with her,

25:00.260 --> 25:01.160
what does that mean?

25:01.180 --> 25:02.990
It means she's going to the laundromat.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.170
Really?

25:04.190 --> 25:06.170
Yeah, and she's never back.

25:06.200 --> 25:07.120
Where are you?

25:07.140 --> 25:08.960
I'm in a car with teddy and ellie.
He just got off.

25:08.980 --> 25:11.540
- Oh, um, tell her I said hello.
- Janet says hello.

25:11.570 --> 25:13.540
- And congratulate teddy.
- I will.

25:13.570 --> 25:15.830
And call the police about your missing daughter.

25:15.850 --> 25:18.640
Ok, first of all, you can't file a missing persons report

25:18.660 --> 25:20.010
for, like, the first 48 hours.

25:20.030 --> 25:21.460
- 24.
- What?

25:21.490 --> 25:24.060
24 hours.
You can file the report in 24 hours.

25:24.080 --> 25:26.870
- How old is she?
- 18.

25:26.890 --> 25:28.770
- She have a boyfriend?
- Yeah.

25:28.790 --> 25:31.210
- Is he in a band?
- Yeah.

25:31.230 --> 25:32.550
She'll be home in two months.

25:32.570 --> 25:34.530
Two months?!
Jesus!

25:34.560 --> 25:37.040
- Ok, calm down.
- How do you know?

25:37.060 --> 25:39.950
Well, I ran away with a lead guitarist when I was 18.

25:39.970 --> 25:42.940
Then, two months later, I found him in bed with a groupie.

25:42.950 --> 25:44.540
What'd you do?

25:44.560 --> 25:46.650
I joined in.
What do you mean, what did I do?

25:46.680 --> 25:49.870
I threw his guitar out the window and then I called my mother.

25:50.910 --> 25:52.500
Is her boyfriend a lead singer?

25:52.520 --> 25:54.470
- Uh, yeah.
- Yes.

25:54.500 --> 25:55.740
Well, then that's totally different.

25:55.760 --> 25:57.270
- That's different.
- It is?

25:57.290 --> 25:58.770
Yeah, she'll be back in two weeks.

25:58.800 --> 26:01.300
- Two weeks?
- Take it easy.

26:02.010 --> 26:03.390
Honey, stop crying.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.440
That is not me, tommy.
That's the baby.

26:05.460 --> 26:07.610
Give him some benadryl.

26:07.630 --> 26:08.750
All right.
You know what, honey?

26:08.780 --> 26:10.590
Hang on a second.
You got a pen?

26:10.610 --> 26:11.760
What's this guy's name?

26:11.780 --> 26:14.460
Oh, uh, it's so italian.

26:14.480 --> 26:15.880
Verucci.

26:15.900 --> 26:17.690
Verucci, ok.
Where's he live?

26:17.710 --> 26:19.630
- I don't know.
- Great.

26:19.650 --> 26:21.250
What's the name of the band?

26:21.270 --> 26:23.030
Christ, uh...

26:23.060 --> 26:24.500
something...

26:24.520 --> 26:26.680
fake baby head.
Why?

26:26.700 --> 26:28.630
Never mind why, ok?
Here you go.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.380
- Jameson'S.
- What?

26:30.400 --> 26:31.770
My mother.When we were babies,

26:31.790 --> 26:34.200
she used to put a little drop of jameson's in our bottles.

26:34.220 --> 26:35.700
Worked like a charm.

26:35.720 --> 26:36.990
Not in this family.

26:37.010 --> 26:38.060
I'll call you back.

26:38.090 --> 26:41.430
You know where the secret ingredient in jameson comes from?

26:41.450 --> 26:43.920
- Where?
- The gavin dna.

26:43.940 --> 26:45.920
Hey, if you see a liquor store, pull over.

26:45.950 --> 26:46.950
See?

26:46.970 --> 26:48.850
That is a bad idea, tom.

26:48.870 --> 26:49.720
Here's one.

26:49.740 --> 26:51.160
Tom, it's a bad idea.

26:51.170 --> 26:53.260
Pull over, eddie, pull over.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.060
All right.
I'll see you guys later.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.230
- It's a bad idea.
- Yeah, it's a bad idea.

26:57.260 --> 26:58.810
I'm doing it.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.020
I'll see you later.

27:02.050 --> 27:03.780
Tom Tommy.
Tom.

27:03.790 --> 27:05.650
Hey, tom, he's right.It's a bad idea,

27:05.660 --> 27:08.610
but since you're going in anyway, could you get me a bottle of cristal?

27:08.640 --> 27:10.170
Yeah, right.
Screw.I'll see you later.

27:10.180 --> 27:11.200
Not those little shooters--

27:11.220 --> 27:12.580
- Screw!
- Would you shut up?

27:12.600 --> 27:14.600
Hey, I've been away for a year.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.530
Sir.

27:36.390 --> 27:37.610
Hey.
Um...

27:37.640 --> 27:40.350
give me a bottle of...

27:40.370 --> 27:41.960
johnnie walker blue.

27:41.990 --> 27:43.610
Ok.

27:46.050 --> 27:47.600
- Yeah?
- "Yeah"?

27:47.620 --> 27:49.130
Uh, that's a nice greeting.

27:49.150 --> 27:50.290
Who's this?

27:50.310 --> 27:52.070
It's nona, you asshole.

27:52.090 --> 27:54.380
Hey, nona.
Uh, what's up?

27:54.400 --> 27:56.520
All right.So are we on for thursday night?

27:56.550 --> 27:58.880
Oh, shit.
You know what?Nona, I--

27:58.910 --> 28:00.420
Tommy, you owe me.

28:00.440 --> 28:01.220
I know.
You know what?

28:01.240 --> 28:03.260
I'm not really dating right now.

28:03.280 --> 28:05.470
Oh, please.
Yeah, right.

28:05.500 --> 28:06.850
I bought a goddamn dress.

28:06.870 --> 28:09.840
Ok, I understand, but, you know...

28:09.890 --> 28:11.480
it just doesn't make any sense, nona.

28:11.500 --> 28:14.210
I got my--you know, I got a baby, I got my wife.

28:14.230 --> 28:16.370
Oh, please, not with the wife again.

28:16.390 --> 28:18.610
Ok, you know what?

28:19.160 --> 28:20.550
My daughter's missing.

28:20.580 --> 28:22.200
- What?
- Yeah.

28:22.230 --> 28:23.320
My daughter ran away.

28:23.340 --> 28:25.390
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah, ok?

28:25.410 --> 28:29.190
I cannot believe you would stoop to this level of bullshit.

28:29.210 --> 28:30.750
I'm not bullshitting, ok?

28:30.770 --> 28:33.460
She ran away with her stupid rock star boyfriend.

28:33.470 --> 28:35.640
Ok, ok, fine.
Sorry.

28:35.670 --> 28:38.850
Yeah, you--you should be, all right?

28:38.880 --> 28:42.080
So everything takes a back seat until I find her.

28:42.100 --> 28:44.060
Yeah.
Right.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.990
Ok.
I got to go.

28:46.010 --> 28:47.540
Jesus.

28:50.190 --> 28:52.900
- How much?
- $229.98.

28:52.940 --> 28:54.880
Jesus christ.
It's whiskey, right?

28:54.900 --> 28:56.270
40-year-old whiskey, sir.

28:56.290 --> 28:59.270
What, are you charging me 8 bucks a year?

28:59.300 --> 29:00.910
There you go.

29:06.890 --> 29:08.310
Michael.

29:09.900 --> 29:11.600
How are you feeling?

29:11.620 --> 29:13.940
I want you to do something for me.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.470
Anything, ma.

29:15.480 --> 29:17.400
Kill me.

29:17.420 --> 29:19.220
I'm--I'm sorry, mom.

29:19.240 --> 29:22.950
The machines and so much stuff.
I couldn't quite catch what you said.

29:22.960 --> 29:24.630
Kill me.

29:25.420 --> 29:27.710
Tonight, if you can.

29:27.740 --> 29:29.650
But, ma...

29:29.670 --> 29:34.730
I don't want a long, slow, ugly death,

29:34.760 --> 29:39.560
stuck in here with these vultures looming above me,

29:39.600 --> 29:42.260
waiting for me to waste away,

29:42.280 --> 29:46.510
sucking all the money I have left into their medical vacuum.

29:46.530 --> 29:49.610
I just want to leave with dignity.

29:49.630 --> 29:55.400
Promise me you won't let me waste away like this.

29:56.850 --> 29:59.230
Promise me.

30:00.300 --> 30:02.010
I love you, mom.

30:02.040 --> 30:04.600
- I don't know if I can--
- You have to.

30:05.360 --> 30:08.830
I don't want to die a penniless vegetable.

30:08.850 --> 30:12.540
Put me out of my misery.
Please.

30:14.760 --> 30:16.470
Ok.

30:17.430 --> 30:18.780
I'll do it.

30:18.800 --> 30:20.360
Good.

30:22.660 --> 30:24.930
Mommy loves you, baby.

30:26.160 --> 30:29.080
Now go find something to kill me with.

30:29.740 --> 30:31.650
Honey, I got to get something out in the open.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.380
- What?
- I know how you are.

30:33.410 --> 30:35.860
You're into guys that are cooped up, and once they get sprung,

30:35.880 --> 30:38.420
you lose interest.
At least that's how it's been, right?

30:38.440 --> 30:40.640
- Oh, but--
- Let Let me finish, darling.

30:40.670 --> 30:43.250
The way I feel about you,

30:43.270 --> 30:45.390
I'll cut right to the chase.

30:45.420 --> 30:48.300
You want to let me go, do it now.

30:48.310 --> 30:50.240
Don't drag it out.

30:50.260 --> 30:52.680
I'd rather get my heart broken now.

30:53.140 --> 30:55.120
Oh, theodore.

30:55.150 --> 30:56.930
You're right.

30:56.950 --> 30:59.300
I used to be that way.

30:59.720 --> 31:01.480
But I've changed.

31:01.500 --> 31:05.420
Your love has transformed me.

31:05.440 --> 31:08.480
I will never leave you,

31:08.510 --> 31:09.870
never.

31:09.890 --> 31:11.470
Oh...

31:11.500 --> 31:14.410
that's fantastic.

31:15.220 --> 31:17.090
I got to go to the can.

31:49.000 --> 31:52.260
Hey, where do the probie wannabes come out after their--

31:52.290 --> 31:53.130
thank you.

31:53.150 --> 31:55.540
- Kenny shea.
- Hey, jimmy the jew.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.240
- Not funny.
- Very funny.

31:57.260 --> 31:59.600
If you're waiting on that black point guard, get in goddamn line.

31:59.620 --> 32:02.470
- Who says I'm waiting on him?
- Common goddamn sense.

32:02.490 --> 32:04.100
- He's mine.
- Oh.

32:04.120 --> 32:05.820
You know, here's a heads-up.

32:05.840 --> 32:08.790
A guy named abraham lincoln freed the slaves,

32:08.810 --> 32:11.340
and then lbj, he re-freed them.

32:11.350 --> 32:13.370
This was decades ago.

32:13.380 --> 32:14.580
One more thing.

32:14.600 --> 32:19.790
There's millions and millions of jews

32:19.820 --> 32:23.290
roaming the world, untethered,

32:23.310 --> 32:25.180
including right here in the big apple.

32:25.200 --> 32:27.370
Hell, you might as well call it the big bagel now.

32:27.390 --> 32:29.500
I'm gettin' that kid, all right?

32:29.520 --> 32:31.540
And if you try to steal him away from me,

32:31.560 --> 32:34.530
I'll use any piece of dirt I can dig up on you

32:34.550 --> 32:37.820
or gavin or anyone else in your lowlife goddamn house.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.080
Anything.

32:39.090 --> 32:41.050
Yeah, well...

32:42.020 --> 32:43.870
- good luck with that.
- Yeah.

32:45.430 --> 32:48.860
Johnny always got me one of tse on my birthday.

32:48.890 --> 32:50.860
He knew I loved the stuff.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.100
It was during the 6 months or so it'd take me to polish it off

32:53.130 --> 32:55.690
that every time I looked the label, I'd see his name

32:55.720 --> 32:57.470
and I'd think of him.

32:58.350 --> 33:00.810
I still think of him, tommy.

33:00.830 --> 33:03.450
Every goddamn day, I think of him.

33:04.110 --> 33:05.770
We all do.

33:05.790 --> 33:08.520
But, you know, you can't go

33:08.540 --> 33:10.820
banging around every day with that kind of guilt,

33:10.830 --> 33:12.580
you know?I mean, my job...

33:13.320 --> 33:19.320
I get 5, 6 shoulda woulda coulda situations a year, and...

33:19.340 --> 33:20.690
I mean, 9/11 alone.

33:20.710 --> 33:23.060
That morning, I got a--

33:23.080 --> 33:24.700
I got a million

33:24.720 --> 33:27.150
shoulda woulda couldas just from that morning alone, you know?

33:27.160 --> 33:28.720
I know, man, but...

33:28.730 --> 33:30.700
he was my partner, you know?

33:30.710 --> 33:32.310
Anyway...

33:34.090 --> 33:35.850
How's--how's the baby?

33:35.880 --> 33:37.600
Spitting image?

33:38.110 --> 33:41.590
He looks, um, a lot like his mother, actually.

33:42.260 --> 33:46.380
So, um, you remember when at johnny's funeral,

33:46.400 --> 33:49.560
you said, you know, any time I needed anything,

33:49.580 --> 33:50.690
you know, I could call you?

33:50.720 --> 33:52.730
Yeah, anything.
Look...

33:52.750 --> 33:54.440
I feel like...

33:54.970 --> 33:57.980
I feel like I owe your family so much, man.

33:58.000 --> 34:00.190
Right.
Anyways...

34:01.470 --> 34:03.360
do you remember

34:03.380 --> 34:06.170
colleen, my oldest?

34:06.190 --> 34:09.659
She ran away with her scumbag boyfriend.

34:09.690 --> 34:11.210
- She's 18 now?
- Yeah.

34:11.239 --> 34:12.270
Her mother just, you know,

34:12.300 --> 34:13.860
completely yessed her to death

34:13.880 --> 34:16.060
from the time--she's spoiled.
I mean, when she was small,

34:16.080 --> 34:18.070
"yes" this, "yes" that, "anything you want, sweetheart,"

34:18.100 --> 34:19.620
"yes, yes, yes." Blah blah blah.

34:19.650 --> 34:20.960
Now, of course, you know,

34:20.989 --> 34:24.190
she's 18 years old and then pulls the ultimate test on her mother--

34:24.210 --> 34:26.900
- she runs away from home.
- Actually...

34:26.920 --> 34:29.440
in a lot of these cases, tommy,

34:29.469 --> 34:31.810
both parents are at fault, bro.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.719
Yeah.

34:36.820 --> 34:38.389
You gonna help me or what?

34:38.420 --> 34:40.710
We usually wait at least 24 hours.

34:40.730 --> 34:45.310
- Plus, she's legal, bro.
- I understand.Are you even gonna

34:45.330 --> 34:47.469
cut me some slack or what?

34:47.469 --> 34:48.830
Yeah.

34:48.850 --> 34:50.610
Give me the boyfriend's name.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.130
This is his name.

34:52.150 --> 34:53.900
That's a band name.

34:53.920 --> 34:55.190
He's in a band.

34:55.210 --> 34:57.090
Now I don't have an address or anything, but

34:57.110 --> 34:58.740
colleen told her mother that his band plays

34:58.790 --> 35:01.610
in all those joints down on the lower east side, so...

35:01.640 --> 35:04.170
- Least I can do, bro.
- Yeah.

35:04.190 --> 35:05.940
I would hope so.

35:05.970 --> 35:07.130
Huh?

35:07.160 --> 35:09.730
I said johnny--johnny'd be proud.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.800
Always here, man.

35:23.650 --> 35:25.490
Are you worried?

35:27.020 --> 35:28.390
Huh?

35:28.410 --> 35:30.800
I said are you worried?

35:30.830 --> 35:32.820
Yeah, I'm worried.

35:35.200 --> 35:37.790
Well, how can you fall asleep, then?

35:42.210 --> 35:44.680
Because somewhere between...

35:45.770 --> 35:48.270
me sleeping with her aunt

35:48.300 --> 35:52.950
and you sleeping with her uncle, I thought maybe

35:52.970 --> 35:57.020
we'd come to a little bit of a mexican standoff.

35:57.810 --> 35:59.550
Ow!
God damn it.

35:59.570 --> 36:01.590
You slept with sheila first.

36:02.070 --> 36:03.480
Ok, ok.

36:03.490 --> 36:05.850
Yeah, when we were separated.

36:05.870 --> 36:07.560
Who had sex first, huh?

36:07.600 --> 36:09.860
Oh, that we can prove?

36:13.780 --> 36:15.530
- That might be her.
- Ok.

36:15.540 --> 36:17.500
You stay here.
I'll go.

36:22.080 --> 36:23.800
Just the neighbors.

36:24.240 --> 36:26.620
- You want a water?
- No.

36:40.810 --> 36:42.250
Hey.

36:44.230 --> 36:45.910
Colleen?

36:49.920 --> 36:52.000
- Tommy?
- Yeah.

36:52.030 --> 36:54.110
You all right?

36:55.420 --> 36:56.460
Yeah, I'm fine.

36:56.480 --> 36:57.440
Tom Tommy, the baby.

36:57.470 --> 36:59.690
Yeah, ok.
I got it, I got it.

37:01.860 --> 37:04.520
- Any word on mike's mom yet?
- No, nothing.

37:04.540 --> 37:08.090
He's basically just gonna move in with her, sit in the room and wait.

37:08.110 --> 37:09.330
Hey, you got something.

37:09.350 --> 37:10.060
Huh?
What?

37:10.080 --> 37:10.930
Hey, why are you touching me?

37:10.960 --> 37:13.920
You had some schmutz on you.
Sorry, it's the baby.

37:13.930 --> 37:15.890
Hey, guys, uh, can I ask you something?

37:15.920 --> 37:17.160
Oh, here we go.

37:17.180 --> 37:18.380
What?What do you mean, "here we go"?

37:18.400 --> 37:20.420
Well, whenever you say, "hey, guys, can I ask you something?"

37:20.440 --> 37:23.450
We're either gonna end up in some ridiculous, dead-end,

37:23.450 --> 37:25.120
incredibly moronic conversation,

37:25.140 --> 37:27.260
or you're gonna say something so stupid that

37:27.290 --> 37:29.240
we're gonna spend the night unable to sleep

37:29.270 --> 37:31.110
because we keep thinking back about what you said

37:31.130 --> 37:34.560
and laughing our tired asses off, not like it's gonna stop you.

37:34.590 --> 37:36.720
My grandmother's lemon chicken, by the way,

37:36.740 --> 37:39.100
so eat slow, you dumb irish micks.

37:39.120 --> 37:40.380
Proceed, sean.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.860
Thank you.

37:41.880 --> 37:43.820
Ok, you know how, uh...

37:44.340 --> 37:46.370
porn has come out, like, on dvd,

37:46.400 --> 37:48.420
so it's, like, really cheap and available and you can

37:48.440 --> 37:51.380
go onto the internet and it's, like, right there, kind of pop-uppable...

37:51.400 --> 37:53.190
- Yeah?
- In your face?

37:53.220 --> 37:54.900
Well, here's my question:

37:54.920 --> 37:57.910
Do you guys--you know, do you still use...

37:57.940 --> 37:59.550
the old spank bank?

37:59.570 --> 38:02.620
Finally, a perfect fit for some fine dinner conversation.

38:02.650 --> 38:04.730
- Congratulations, garrity.
- You're welcome.

38:04.750 --> 38:06.460
I'll play.

38:06.470 --> 38:07.720
My wife's a snoop.

38:07.740 --> 38:09.100
I don't use a computer.

38:09.110 --> 38:11.880
I hate my wife and I have a lot of romantic regrets, so

38:11.890 --> 38:14.850
my spank bank's open every goddamn day.

38:15.470 --> 38:16.900
Who you got, "t"?

38:17.610 --> 38:20.760
Ellen degeneres.

38:24.750 --> 38:26.550
What?
You guys seen her dance?

38:26.570 --> 38:28.140
Ok, you know what?
It's official now.

38:28.170 --> 38:31.280
You definitely need some sleep.Nils?

38:31.310 --> 38:32.920
This chicken.
Jesus, lou.

38:32.940 --> 38:34.660
Yeah, well, my grandmother will be very proud.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.920
Thank you.
Frank?

38:35.940 --> 38:38.760
Um, yeah, you know, I usually keep a rotating stable of,

38:38.780 --> 38:41.440
like, a dozen or so women in my bank:

38:41.460 --> 38:43.640
Famous chicks, chicks I've saved in fires,

38:43.670 --> 38:44.920
chicks I meet at my actual bank.

38:44.940 --> 38:46.980
That's my bank spank bank.

38:47.000 --> 38:49.220
But ever since I met natalie, you know, she's the only one in there.

38:49.250 --> 38:50.010
I might be in love.

38:50.040 --> 38:52.420
Love in the spank bank.
That allowed?

38:52.440 --> 38:54.880
Well, in franco's case, we'll make an exception.

38:55.760 --> 38:56.890
Who do you got, lou?

38:56.910 --> 38:59.920
Well, you're assuming I get to jerk off, which...

38:59.940 --> 39:03.020
in my case, seeing as how I'm dating a sex-crazed ex-nun,

39:03.050 --> 39:05.020
it's not the case.

39:05.050 --> 39:07.840
I make a move for my joint, 9 times out of 10,

39:07.860 --> 39:09.570
she's already saddled up and ready for the ride.

39:09.600 --> 39:11.360
All right, well, when you were jerking off?

39:11.390 --> 39:12.680
An eclectic mix:

39:12.700 --> 39:14.950
Jessica lange, jessica biel.

39:14.980 --> 39:16.540
Jesus, lou, she's old enough to be your daughter.

39:16.570 --> 39:18.090
Yeah, bingo.
Sally field.

39:18.110 --> 39:19.160
Now or "gidget"?

39:19.190 --> 39:20.600
No, "flying nun," which

39:20.620 --> 39:23.090
might explain my current situation.

39:23.550 --> 39:25.660
How 'bout you, hot stuff?

39:25.680 --> 39:28.290
Well, at this stage of the game, my wife's got a bigger bank than I do.

39:28.310 --> 39:29.700
I'm eating.

39:29.730 --> 39:31.410
Let me think, though.
Scarlet johansson.

39:31.430 --> 39:32.540
- Oh, yeah.
- For sure.

39:32.560 --> 39:35.550
Jennifer aniston, jennifer garner,

39:35.580 --> 39:37.100
uh, barbara hirsch.

39:37.120 --> 39:37.940
Who?

39:37.960 --> 39:39.490
She was this chick I went to high school with.

39:39.510 --> 39:42.360
Uh, brittany klein, another chick I went to high school with.

39:42.390 --> 39:44.230
Karen posnowski.
Whoo!

39:44.250 --> 39:45.770
She was on the swim team.

39:45.790 --> 39:47.660
Uh, janet.
Uh, let's see.

39:47.680 --> 39:48.930
This chick I met, um--

39:48.950 --> 39:50.300
Janet who?

39:52.510 --> 39:53.470
What?

39:53.500 --> 39:55.350
Janet who?

39:57.000 --> 39:58.340
Janet...

39:58.370 --> 40:01.990
uh, jana...kowski.

40:02.010 --> 40:05.190
She was, uh, on the debate team.

40:05.210 --> 40:06.680
She was so hot.

40:06.700 --> 40:08.230
She was really--she could really debate.

40:08.230 --> 40:09.830
- Who else?
- Uh-- Shit.

40:09.870 --> 40:11.040
Give me the knives.

40:11.070 --> 40:12.290
What?
What's happening?

40:12.310 --> 40:14.150
- Give me your knife.
- What's happening?

40:14.170 --> 40:15.850
I don't understand.

40:18.740 --> 40:19.830
Anyway, where was I?

40:19.850 --> 40:21.730
Uh--oh, the chick that we-- remember the--remember the--

40:21.760 --> 40:23.420
I think you were talking about my wife,

40:23.460 --> 40:24.340
- that's what I think.
- No, god!

40:24.370 --> 40:26.110
- I was not talking--your wife?
- Yes, you were.

40:26.130 --> 40:27.440
You're jerking off to my wife.

40:27.460 --> 40:28.470
No!
Oh, my god!

40:28.490 --> 40:30.450
That's what you said.
Yes, you did.

40:30.450 --> 40:31.830
- Tom, I would never--
- You just said it.

40:31.830 --> 40:33.590
- Yes, you did.You said--
- I did not.

40:33.610 --> 40:34.480
Yes, you did.Yes, you did.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.190
- Yes, you did.
- I d I did?

40:35.220 --> 40:36.270
Yes, yes.

40:36.290 --> 40:37.350
Ok, I did, but let me explain.

40:37.370 --> 40:39.170
It was the picnic a few years ago, ok?

40:39.220 --> 40:41.400
Remember, she showed up with the white blouse on

40:41.410 --> 40:42.430
and it was kind of see-through, you know,

40:42.450 --> 40:43.840
and then we had a water balloon fight!

40:43.860 --> 40:45.750
I mean, come on!

40:46.630 --> 40:48.690
The water balloon fight?

40:48.710 --> 40:51.610
Come on.You guys remember the water balloon fight, right?

40:51.630 --> 40:53.900
Come on.
Guys, help me out.

40:54.560 --> 40:56.810
Oh, my god!
Come on!

40:56.840 --> 40:58.290
Ohhh...

40:58.320 --> 40:59.620
Tommy, listen.

40:59.640 --> 41:02.100
You're jerking off to my wife?

41:02.120 --> 41:04.270
- I never jerk off to janet--
- Ah, ah, ah!

41:04.290 --> 41:05.810
Don't use her name in the same sentence.

41:05.830 --> 41:07.200
Ok, if you just let me explain, it's very innocent.

41:07.220 --> 41:08.490
Ok, yeah.
Explain, explain.

41:08.510 --> 41:09.630
- In my mind...
- In your mind.

41:09.650 --> 41:11.510
She--she just kind of wanders in

41:11.520 --> 41:12.980
- and she happens--
- She wanders in where?

41:13.010 --> 41:14.290
She wanders into my mind,

41:14.310 --> 41:16.900
and she comes in wearing the same white blouse,

41:16.930 --> 41:19.360
and it's see-through and wet and clingy,

41:19.380 --> 41:21.240
- and she tries to seduce me, ok?
- And she does what?

41:21.260 --> 41:22.780
She--she tries to seduce me, ok?

41:22.800 --> 41:24.470
She tries to un--un...

41:24.500 --> 41:27.140
- blouse herself.
- Janet tried to unblouse herself?

41:27.160 --> 41:29.400
From the clingy, wet blouse,

41:29.420 --> 41:31.450
but here's the thing.
I don't--I don't do it.

41:31.470 --> 41:32.610
I run--I run away.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.670
I run into the arms of janet--

41:34.690 --> 41:36.900
janet-fer aniston.

41:42.920 --> 41:44.240
You believe--this is--

41:44.260 --> 41:45.320
he's married to my sister and he's

41:45.340 --> 41:47.700
jerking off to my wife.

41:47.740 --> 41:50.060
- No, I'm not.
- I mean, I--I--y-yeah.

41:50.090 --> 41:53.600
It's just a matter of time before my 18-year-old daughter.

42:12.520 --> 42:14.630
Excuse me.

42:17.120 --> 42:18.750

42:21.560 --> 42:22.990

42:28.400 --> 42:29.310
Yeah?

42:29.330 --> 42:31.610

42:31.630 --> 42:34.500

42:34.510 --> 42:36.010

42:36.920 --> 42:39.480

42:43.240 --> 42:45.560

42:54.340 --> 42:55.870

42:55.890 --> 42:57.370

42:57.390 --> 42:59.130
