So why do our schools stop kids

01:50.211 --> 01:51.379

Damn it, I quit "Barney"

The "agrarian" calendar

02:16.404 --> 02:18.206

02:18.206 --> 02:19.573
The real reason schools close

02:19.573 --> 02:20.908
in the summer is because

02:20.908 --> 02:21.575
of the heat.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.177
A 100 years ago, we didn't have

(power drains)

02:26.947 --> 02:28.416
During the summer, classrooms

02:28.416 --> 02:30.418
would become so unbearably hot

02:30.418 --> 02:31.752

especially hard on the poorest

with every day.

04:59.367 --> 05:00.334
Why?

05:00.334 --> 05:01.335
Well, our kids live in really

05:01.335 --> 05:02.670
unsafe neighborhoods, so they

05:02.670 --> 05:04.104
stay inside in front of the

05:04.104 --> 05:05.839
television all summer long.

05:05.839 --> 05:07.007
What do you guys do to help?

05:07.007 --> 05:08.175
We provide free summer

05:08.175 --> 05:09.877
programs and academics, arts,

05:09.877 --> 05:11.244
and athletics so the kids can

05:11.244 --> 05:13.046
stay safe, off the street, and

05:13.046 --> 05:13.847
away from gangs.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.349
That doesn't sound that bad.

05:15.349 --> 05:16.417
We're doing all we can, but

05:16.417 --> 05:17.951
unfortunately there's still

05:17.951 --> 05:19.086
millions of kids who have no

05:19.086 --> 05:19.887
where to go during the summer.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.689
Speaking of which, we got to get

05:21.689 --> 05:22.756
back to work.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.558
Bye, guys.

05:24.558 --> 05:25.426
Oh, man.

05:25.426 --> 05:26.927
I want to love summer,

05:26.927 --> 05:28.762
but that's just so sad.

05:28.762 --> 05:29.530
Yeah.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.064
In other countries like Japan

05:31.064 --> 05:32.433
and England, students get

05:32.433 --> 05:34.034
multiple short breaks throughout

05:34.034 --> 05:34.735
the year.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.604
But in our system, we just wash

05:36.604 --> 05:38.439
our hands of the neediest kids

05:38.439 --> 05:40.941
for three whole months.

05:40.941 --> 05:42.142
And that means summer vacation

05:42.142 --> 05:44.445
hurts kids just like you.

05:44.445 --> 05:46.914
Ugh, knowledge is the worst.

06:35.162 --> 06:36.697
America's copyright laws.

06:36.697 --> 06:38.932
Uh, okay.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.868
I'm just a kid, why should I

06:40.868 --> 06:41.869
care about that dumb law?

06:41.869 --> 06:43.671
Because that dumb law is

06:43.671 --> 06:44.838
keeping you from your favorite

06:44.838 --> 06:45.606

06:45.606 --> 06:47.608
No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:47.608 --> 06:48.609
I don't want learn anything

06:48.609 --> 06:49.276
about this.

06:49.276 --> 06:50.343
Well, I'm gonna make you

06:50.343 --> 06:52.212
through the magic of cartoons.

06:52.212 --> 06:53.614
Ever since his first appearance

06:53.614 --> 06:54.715
as Steamboat Willie,

06:54.715 --> 06:56.817
kids have loved Mickey Mouse.

06:56.817 --> 06:58.886
All right, no pants.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.521
Wait, why are my knees doing

07:00.521 --> 07:01.655
this?

07:01.655 --> 07:02.890
Old cartoons are mostly about

07:02.890 --> 07:05.325
bouncing and torturing animals.

07:05.325 --> 07:06.627
(duck honks)

07:06.627 --> 07:07.628
And back in the 20's our

07:07.628 --> 07:08.629
copyright system worked the way

07:08.629 --> 07:09.797
it was supposed to.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.364
An artist who created a new work

07:11.364 --> 07:12.966

09:08.849 --> 09:09.850
Books, songs, movies, even

they can't share themselves.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.787
That's so sad.

09:46.787 --> 09:47.955
They just want to be part

09:47.955 --> 09:49.022

09:49.022 --> 09:49.957
That's right.

09:49.957 --> 09:50.958
Until the last 50 years, every

09:50.958 --> 09:52.860
generation in American history

09:52.860 --> 09:54.962
has had free and legal access

09:54.962 --> 09:56.463

09:56.463 --> 09:57.297
They can learn from it,

09:57.297 --> 09:58.565
they can build on it.

09:58.565 --> 10:00.300
Now, all that creativity is

10:00.300 --> 10:02.636
locked away.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.304
And the true irony is that

10:04.304 --> 10:05.906
no one understood that better

10:05.906 --> 10:06.573
than Walt Disney.

10:06.573 --> 10:07.574
Dozen of Disney characters were

10:07.574 --> 10:10.744

11:42.069 --> 11:43.737
until the 1980's.

11:43.737 --> 11:45.338
But that was so long ago.

11:45.338 --> 11:46.807

11:55.448 --> 11:58.418
a frilly dress, and pretty hat.

11:58.418 --> 11:59.619
What gender are they?

11:59.619 --> 12:02.022
Well, based on my knowledge

12:02.022 --> 12:03.857
of disgusting girls,

12:03.857 --> 12:05.492
I say female.

12:05.492 --> 12:06.159
Wrong.

12:06.159 --> 12:07.160
I'm describing our 32nd

12:07.160 --> 12:08.929
president Franklin Delano

12:08.929 --> 12:09.662
Roosevelt.

12:09.662 --> 12:11.664
Before Word War II, little boys

12:11.664 --> 12:13.033
and little girls wore the same

12:13.033 --> 12:15.035
outfits: pretty dresses.

12:15.035 --> 12:18.338
Ugh, I hate it.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.841
Wait a minute, I can actually

12:20.841 --> 12:23.510
really move in this.

12:23.510 --> 12:25.645
In the 1950's, gender

12:25.645 --> 12:26.313
specific clothing came

12:26.313 --> 12:27.647
into fashion.

12:27.647 --> 12:28.515
And it all basically

12:28.515 --> 12:29.349
started dressing kids like

12:29.349 --> 12:31.684
smaller versions of themselves.

12:31.684 --> 12:34.687
Ah, man, I liked the dress.

12:34.687 --> 12:35.856
Hey, cool, I look like a car

12:35.856 --> 12:37.224
salesmen!

12:37.224 --> 12:39.192
In the 70's, unisex fashion

12:39.192 --> 12:42.162
once again became all the rage.

12:42.162 --> 12:44.832
I can't tell what I am.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.633
Well, at least my neck is warm.

12:46.633 --> 12:48.701
Until the mid-80's

12:48.701 --> 12:50.203
when gender norms once again

12:50.203 --> 12:52.172
took over, and pink for girls

12:52.172 --> 12:53.807
and blue for boys became

12:53.807 --> 12:55.876
basically mandatory.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.544
This looks great, but it

12:57.544 --> 12:59.847
could use a bit more blue.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.514
And it wasn't just clothes,

13:01.514 --> 13:03.650
in the 80's the toy aisle also

13:03.650 --> 13:05.986
became strictly divided into boy

13:05.986 --> 13:08.321
and girl, trucks and dolls.

13:08.321 --> 13:10.257
And that's when the same thing

13:10.257 --> 13:12.392
happened to video games.

13:12.392 --> 13:13.693
(straining)

13:17.898 --> 13:19.566
Early video games like "Pong"

13:19.566 --> 13:21.168
were totally unisex.

13:21.168 --> 13:23.736
Am I boy dot or girl dot?

13:23.736 --> 13:25.105
You're just a dot.

13:25.105 --> 13:26.739
Ow, ow, ow, ow.

13:26.739 --> 13:27.841
In fact, the game was

13:27.841 --> 13:29.709
marketed to the entire family.

13:29.709 --> 13:30.743
What about "Pac-Man"?

13:30.743 --> 13:31.744
He was a boy.

13:31.744 --> 13:33.080
True, but the game was so

13:33.080 --> 13:34.547
popular with women, that when

13:34.547 --> 13:36.049
came time for a sequel the

13:36.049 --> 13:37.584
developers gave it a female

13:37.584 --> 13:40.020
main character, "Ms. Pac-Man".

13:40.020 --> 13:42.355
Oh yeah, I'm spooky.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.957
Not "Mrs.", "Ms."

13:43.957 --> 13:45.225
She was a modern 80's

13:45.225 --> 13:46.059
career woman.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.527
I have an MBA in eating

13:47.527 --> 13:48.228
ghosts.

13:48.228 --> 13:50.030
Wacha-wacha-wacha-wacha-wacha.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.298
(cries out)

13:51.298 --> 13:52.565
She's so confident.

13:52.565 --> 13:53.967
And not only was much of the

13:53.967 --> 13:55.735
audience female, many of the

13:55.768 --> 13:56.769
developers were too.

13:56.769 --> 13:58.305
Among the stars of early game

13:58.305 --> 14:00.407
design were Atari's Carol Shaw,

14:00.407 --> 14:02.375
"Centipede" creator Donna

14:02.375 --> 14:03.710
Bailey, and Roberta Williams,

14:03.743 --> 14:05.078
an adventure game pioneer and

14:05.078 --> 14:07.047
company co-founder whose

14:07.047 --> 14:07.981
"King's Quest" series was a

14:07.981 --> 14:10.117
massive hit among gamers of all

14:10.117 --> 14:10.918
stripes.

14:10.918 --> 14:11.919
Cool, seems like everything's

14:11.919 --> 14:12.652
great.

14:12.652 --> 14:13.653
Can I play my game now?

14:13.653 --> 14:15.088
Nope, because all of that

14:15.088 --> 14:16.756
changed thanks to video game

14:16.756 --> 14:18.725
crash of 1983.

14:18.725 --> 14:20.093
Greedy publishers started

14:20.093 --> 14:21.428
flooding the market with shoddy

14:21.428 --> 14:24.131
games like "I Want My Mommy",

14:24.131 --> 14:26.900
"Lost Luggage", and "E.T." for

14:26.900 --> 14:28.969
the Atari 2600, which has been

14:28.969 --> 14:30.003
called one of the worst games

14:30.003 --> 14:31.204
of all time.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.173
Yuck! I'll play anything

14:33.173 --> 14:34.975
and even I know that's a turd.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.409
Most adults stop playing

14:36.409 --> 14:37.477
games entirely, and the video

14:37.510 --> 14:39.412
game market cratered.

14:39.412 --> 14:40.813
(explosions)

14:40.813 --> 14:41.781
So when it came time to

14:41.781 --> 14:43.083
marketing the original Nintendo

14:43.083 --> 14:44.084
entertainment system, Nintendo

14:44.084 --> 14:45.986
devised a plan.

14:45.986 --> 14:46.987
Instead of selling it in the

14:46.987 --> 14:48.755
electronics section, they sold

14:48.755 --> 14:50.490
it toy aisle.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.325
But by then the toy aisle was

14:52.325 --> 14:53.994
completely separated into pink

14:53.994 --> 14:55.996
and blue, boy and girl.

14:55.996 --> 14:58.098
Nintendo had to choose a side.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.333
They went with boy, and then

15:00.333 --> 15:01.534
they marketed to those boys

15:01.534 --> 15:02.802
restlessly.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.637
What's it like to play the

15:04.637 --> 15:07.307
Nintendo entertainment system?

kind of advertising...

What's up, bitch?

15:50.383 --> 15:51.584
...we now think of video

15:51.584 --> 15:53.886
games as being the exclusive

15:53.920 --> 15:55.722
domain of the male sex.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.058
Okay, those ads are weird.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.060
But boys just like video games

16:00.060 --> 16:01.061
more than girls do.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.395
Sorry, Jake, that's a

16:02.395 --> 16:03.363
straight up myth.

16:03.363 --> 16:04.864
More adult women play video

16:04.864 --> 16:07.000
games than teenage boys do.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.236
That's just counting stupid

16:09.269 --> 16:10.237
phone games.

16:10.237 --> 16:11.038
Uh, so?

16:11.038 --> 16:12.572
Games are games, Jake.

16:12.572 --> 16:13.706
All that means is that

16:13.740 --> 16:15.542
mainstream consoles like PS4

16:15.542 --> 16:17.344
and Xbox One are refusing to

16:17.344 --> 16:19.379
serve a huge untapped market.

16:21.348 --> 16:22.882
We're talking millions of women

16:22.882 --> 16:24.717
who love to play more games,

16:24.717 --> 16:26.186
but are being pushed away from

16:26.186 --> 16:28.188
the hobby weird, old-fashion

16:28.188 --> 16:29.689
marketing that publishers are

16:29.689 --> 16:31.191
sticking with seemingly out of

16:31.191 --> 16:32.692
sheer force of habit.

16:34.527 --> 16:35.695
Aah, who's doing that?

16:37.930 --> 16:39.699
Why are you hurting me, Megan?

16:39.699 --> 16:41.101
Because I'm mad at you.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.202
I like games.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.570
I've always like them.

16:43.570 --> 16:44.771
It's just sometimes I feel like

16:44.771 --> 16:45.805
they don't love me back.

16:45.805 --> 16:47.107
You act like I'm not supposed to

16:47.107 --> 16:48.275
play them or something just

16:48.275 --> 16:49.142
because you listen to all these

16:49.142 --> 16:50.377
stupid ads.

16:50.377 --> 16:51.644
Jake, video games are the

16:51.644 --> 16:53.246
greatest new art form of the

16:53.246 --> 16:53.946
century.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.882
They can do anything.

16:55.882 --> 16:56.916
Saying they're for just one

16:56.916 --> 16:58.918
gender is ridiculous.

16:58.918 --> 17:00.087
Yeah, it's like saying movies

17:00.087 --> 17:01.321
are just for girls or books are

17:01.321 --> 17:02.622
just for dads.

17:02.622 --> 17:03.456
It's stupid.

17:03.456 --> 17:04.324
When we think about

17:04.324 --> 17:05.592
video games in such a limited

17:05.592 --> 17:07.627
way, it makes the games worse,

17:07.627 --> 17:09.262
it loses the industry money,

17:09.262 --> 17:10.730
and it really mean to your

17:10.730 --> 17:11.564
sister.

17:12.632 --> 17:13.433
Fine!

17:13.433 --> 17:14.467
All I wanted to do was have fun

17:14.467 --> 17:15.668
on the last day of summer.

17:15.668 --> 17:17.337
But I guess summer sucks,

17:17.337 --> 17:21.508
cartoons suck, video games suck,

17:21.508 --> 17:23.009
and all I have to do forever

17:23.009 --> 17:24.511
is learn about stupid things

17:24.511 --> 17:26.146
that make fun suck!

17:26.146 --> 17:27.147
Jake, if you wait one second,

I'll tell you why learning makes

17:28.581 --> 17:29.516
everything more fun.

anything today, buddy?

17:47.200 --> 17:52.205

Where are we?

18:03.116 --> 18:03.950
Oh, these are games that

18:03.950 --> 18:05.051
I play when you're not around.

18:05.051 --> 18:06.319
So, Jake, when Nintendo

18:06.319 --> 18:07.554
learned that making games just

18:07.554 --> 18:08.788
for boys was limiting their

18:08.788 --> 18:10.890
audience, they hired a female

18:10.890 --> 18:12.225
director to create

18:12.225 --> 18:15.027
"Animal Crossing: New Leaf".

18:15.027 --> 18:16.396
You play this too, Megan?

18:16.396 --> 18:17.797
I love this game.

18:17.797 --> 18:18.465
Uh-huh.

18:18.465 --> 18:19.566
Me too, it fulfills my

18:19.566 --> 18:20.733
childhood fantasy of making

18:20.733 --> 18:22.235
friends and owning property.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.137
It also broke sales records,

18:24.137 --> 18:26.038
and 56 percent of the people

18:26.038 --> 18:27.073
playing it are women.

18:27.073 --> 18:27.874
Really?

18:27.874 --> 18:29.409
(imitates explosion)

18:29.409 --> 18:30.710
Yeah, and with the rise of

18:30.710 --> 18:31.844
indie games, more and more

18:31.844 --> 18:33.480
female developers are getting to

18:33.513 --> 18:34.681
make whole new types of

18:34.714 --> 18:35.648
video games.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.049
Just ask Kellee Santiago,

18:37.049 --> 18:38.351
one of creators of "Journey".

18:38.351 --> 18:39.586
Oh, I love "Journey",

18:39.586 --> 18:40.553
it's so beautiful,

18:40.553 --> 18:42.489
But where is she?

18:42.489 --> 18:43.190
Over here, Megan.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.457
I'm just hanging out

18:44.491 --> 18:45.858
in my own game.

18:45.858 --> 18:47.160
Cool.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.395
When we created "Journey",

18:48.395 --> 18:49.329
we wanted to make a game that

18:49.362 --> 18:50.897
anyone could relate to.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.932
So our theory was that console

18:52.932 --> 18:54.434
video games and gamers

18:54.434 --> 18:56.369
were being unfairly pigeon holed

18:56.369 --> 18:57.837
into only a limited range

18:57.837 --> 18:58.505
of genres.

18:58.505 --> 18:59.706
Our goal with "Journey" was to

18:59.706 --> 19:00.540
show that games can be about

19:00.540 --> 19:02.008
something else and that both

19:02.008 --> 19:03.610
avid and first-time gamers would

19:03.610 --> 19:04.877
embrace these new types

19:04.877 --> 19:05.878
of games.

19:05.878 --> 19:06.679
And it worked.

19:06.679 --> 19:07.747
"Journey" was a massive hit

19:07.747 --> 19:09.582
among all types of gamers.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.050
It does look pretty fun.

19:11.050 --> 19:12.285
And now developers are really

19:12.285 --> 19:13.920
experimenting with reaching all

19:13.920 --> 19:14.854
types of players.

19:14.854 --> 19:16.689
It's an incredibly exciting time

19:16.689 --> 19:17.757
in video games.

19:17.757 --> 19:18.525
Thanks, Kellee.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.859
Bye, got to go, there's a

19:19.859 --> 19:20.927
sandstorm coming.

19:20.927 --> 19:21.728
Bye, Kellee.

19:21.728 --> 19:22.595
Bye.

19:22.595 --> 19:23.863
Video games are all about

19:23.863 --> 19:25.064
unbridled imagination.

19:25.064 --> 19:26.233
So when we set them free of

19:26.233 --> 19:28.034
arbitrary restrictions, they're

19:28.034 --> 19:29.302
more fun than ever.

19:29.302 --> 19:30.903
Copy right law's

19:30.903 --> 19:31.804
the same way.

19:31.804 --> 19:33.440
If we just let the Public Domain

19:33.440 --> 19:34.641
flourish, think of all the

19:34.641 --> 19:36.276
awesome new works that would be

19:36.276 --> 19:37.477
created.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.479
Or summer breaks.

19:39.479 --> 19:40.580
If we looked at our educational

19:40.580 --> 19:42.148
system with fresh eyes, we can

19:42.148 --> 19:43.383
make sure that every kid has

19:43.383 --> 19:45.084
just as fun a summer as you.

19:45.084 --> 19:46.118
We don't have to keep doing

19:46.118 --> 19:48.120
things the same way just because

19:48.120 --> 19:48.821
that's how people did them in

19:48.821 --> 19:49.722
the past.

19:49.722 --> 19:51.491
We have the power to learn about

19:51.491 --> 19:53.226
the world and improve it

19:53.226 --> 19:54.727
so that future generations can

19:54.727 --> 19:56.763
have fun without limits.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.431
So what you're saying is

19:58.431 --> 20:00.600
if we learn we can be free of

20:00.600 --> 20:02.269
society's dumb rules?

20:02.269 --> 20:04.070
That's exactly right.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.972
Okay, well, then you know

20:05.972 --> 20:06.639
what I want.

20:06.639 --> 20:07.440
Mm-hm.

20:09.742 --> 20:12.144
All right!

20:12.144 --> 20:14.514
But-- oh, no.

20:14.514 --> 20:15.282
The last day of summer

20:15.282 --> 20:17.617
is almost over, and I ripped up

20:17.617 --> 20:19.286
my notebook.

20:19.286 --> 20:22.154
How will I have fun now?

20:22.154 --> 20:24.156
Want to play "Journey"?

20:24.156 --> 20:25.124
You still want to play

20:25.124 --> 20:25.858
with me?

20:25.858 --> 20:28.261
You're annoying and weird,

20:28.261 --> 20:30.397
but okay.

20:31.498 --> 20:35.435
(both whispering)

20:35.435 --> 20:36.336
Looks like my work here

20:36.336 --> 20:37.003
is done.

20:37.003 --> 20:39.272
(chuckling)

20:39.272 --> 20:41.941
Megan, Jake, we're home.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.344
Who the (bleep) are you?

20:44.344 --> 20:45.345
♪♪

20:47.647 --> 20:49.449
Woo, don't get those,

20:49.449 --> 20:50.983
they're loaded with sugar.

20:50.983 --> 20:52.051
Thanks for the tip.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.553
And the beef jerky is

20:53.553 --> 20:54.854
high in sodium.

20:54.887 --> 20:55.622
I know, I'm just gonna get

20:55.622 --> 20:58.124
like a little bit, so it's fine.

20:58.124 --> 20:59.726
Not staying away from the

20:59.726 --> 21:01.193
gluten I see.

21:01.193 --> 21:02.128
You know, has anyone ever

21:02.128 --> 21:03.062
told you, you can be

21:03.062 --> 21:04.030
a little abrasive?
