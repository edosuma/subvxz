00:00.888 --> 00:02.848
One, two. One, two.

00:03.015 --> 00:05.225
Hello, I'm Jordan.
Best stand-up comic this side of Mars.

00:05.392 --> 00:07.352
Also the only stand-up comic
this side of Mars,

00:07.519 --> 00:09.770
but don't tell my mum that,
she's super impressed.

00:09.937 --> 00:11.689
Laugh, laugh, laugh.

00:11.856 --> 00:14.316
-Two, two, "is this thing on"?
-Yeah, it's on...

00:14.483 --> 00:18.361
No... I know. It's a bit,
the "is this on" thing,

00:18.528 --> 00:21.197
to imply that the audience
weren't laughing.

00:22.489 --> 00:26.243
Best thing about doing stand-up
in space? Literally no pressure.

00:27.285 --> 00:29.245
-Is this thing on?
-Yup.

00:29.412 --> 00:31.288
No, I know it's...

00:32.331 --> 00:35.959
And then I'll plug the beer. And...

00:36.126 --> 00:38.586
When I first took this gig on,
they told me

00:38.753 --> 00:41.672
that I needed enough material
to cover the first half of the journey,

00:41.839 --> 00:45.509
so I guess now I need a tight
one year and three quarters.

00:45.676 --> 00:47.927
Is that funny?
Or is that too much maths?

00:48.094 --> 00:49.929
Math.

00:51.514 --> 00:56.393
-Oh, God! That's not good.
-It's shit. That's all shit!

00:56.560 --> 00:58.394
Hey, maybe they heard your set.

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074

01:17.160 --> 01:20.330
Captain, are you ready to do this?

01:21.622 --> 01:26.710
I always hoped that my last words
might be better than, "Fuck me, no".

01:26.877 --> 01:28.920
I don't know how to attach the tether.

01:29.087 --> 01:32.340
There should be an instruction panel
right in front of you.

01:33.382 --> 01:35.425
<i>To attach your safety tether</i>

01:35.592 --> 01:39.471
<i>simply grasp the narrow end of the clamp</i>
<i>to release the G Catch.</i>

01:39.637 --> 01:41.973
<i>There. That wasn't so hard was it?</i>

01:42.139 --> 01:44.016
Well, you fucking try it.

01:46.226 --> 01:50.772
<i>Okay, it's a space walk, so... walk.</i>

01:54.733 --> 01:58.528
So Captain, what exactly
are you looking at?

01:58.695 --> 02:00.363
The inside of my eyelids.

02:02.698 --> 02:04.283
There appears to be no floor.

02:08.036 --> 02:11.622
Yes, Captain.
<i>You really make this look easy.</i>

02:11.789 --> 02:13.958
Why is he flailing around like that?
What...

02:14.125 --> 02:16.293
-No, look. He's up right now.
-Yes.

02:16.460 --> 02:20.046
No, just gone back. Where you going?

02:20.213 --> 02:22.256
I'm going to do 600 pushups
and then throw up in the sink.

02:22.423 --> 02:25.259
Can you get visuals
on the wet suit compromise?

02:25.426 --> 02:28.845
"Have visuals"?
What's wrong with "see"?

02:29.012 --> 02:30.972
-Or "come back in"?
-Engineering?

02:31.139 --> 02:32.765
-Present.
-Yeah. Not you.

02:32.932 --> 02:36.518
Looking at wet suit protocol three now.
Captain Courageous needs to locate

02:36.685 --> 02:40.271
the lateral access valve,
where it intersects with the bi...

02:40.438 --> 02:44.608
Intersects with the binary caps
from the lower deck. Did you get that?

02:44.775 --> 02:47.236
All I got from that was
"you're going to die out here".

02:47.402 --> 02:50.113
<i>Find a big metal wheel and turn it off.</i>

02:50.280 --> 02:52.865
-Estimate of her velocity, Captain?
<i>-I might actually sneeze.</i>

02:53.032 --> 02:55.659
He can't hear you,
because, well, you know, he's outside...

02:55.826 --> 02:58.662
<i>What happens then? Billie? What's</i>
<i>the sneezing protocol in space?</i>

02:58.829 --> 03:00.413
Get me in his ear. I'll walk him home.

03:00.580 --> 03:03.124
<i>Is there one? Did you look that up?</i>

03:03.291 --> 03:05.209
<i>-Voila.</i>
<i>-Gracias.</i>

03:05.376 --> 03:11.339
Yeah, in other devastating news,
Spike is about to join the auto comms.

03:11.506 --> 03:14.759
-The icing on the shit.
<i>-I got you now, buddy.</i>

03:14.925 --> 03:18.345
-Oh, she's a gusher.
-Please don't call it "she."

03:18.512 --> 03:22.265
Why? That things powerful.
And I respect it.

03:22.432 --> 03:23.933
I'm going to check on a valve.

03:24.100 --> 03:27.394
-Billie?
-Mr. Tambourine man, you're up.

03:27.561 --> 03:29.062
-Yeah, sure.
-Billy?

03:29.229 --> 03:34.901
So, we're just splitting forward
protocol three. It's just a thing we do.

03:35.067 --> 03:39.029
-We love you, Spike!
<i>-I'm splitting forward protocol three.</i>

03:39.196 --> 03:41.614
<i>It's just a thing we do, don't worry.</i>

03:41.781 --> 03:45.785
-Make way for the shit shooter.
-Oh, God, was that me?

03:45.951 --> 03:47.745
It's a little bit of all of us.

03:47.911 --> 03:50.372
Hey! I got a button
on the end of my fist.

03:50.539 --> 03:53.291
Do you want to press it with your face,
button dick?

03:53.458 --> 03:54.876
I think she's talking to me.

03:58.045 --> 04:01.047
<i>Yeah, so nobody thought to put</i>
<i>this wheel on the inside.</i>

04:01.214 --> 04:02.841
<i>Wouldn't that have been easier?</i>

04:07.094 --> 04:08.971
-Oh, bugger me!
-Oh, no!

04:09.138 --> 04:11.598
Oh, I can taste last year's breakfast.

04:11.765 --> 04:15.017
Some guys would pay good money
to have that done to them.

04:15.184 --> 04:17.853
And girls. Women.

04:18.896 --> 04:20.564
Not me though.

04:20.731 --> 04:23.525
<i>Other way, other way.</i>

04:24.984 --> 04:29.363
Don't worry, Captain, you got this.
<i>I've got this.</i>

04:29.530 --> 04:31.281
Turn it this way.

04:32.324 --> 04:35.243
Of course I've got it.
I was born getting it.

04:35.410 --> 04:37.745
<i>I haven't got it. Help me more.</i>

04:38.912 --> 04:40.581
That's it.

04:55.927 --> 04:57.345
Yeah!

04:59.138 --> 05:01.265
Alan, get me a car to Buffalo!

05:01.431 --> 05:03.224
-You're going to the White House?
-Oh, yes.

05:03.391 --> 05:05.184
Time to do
some corporate begging. Yes?

05:13.775 --> 05:18.154
<i>There he is.</i>
<i>There he is. I believed in you.</i>

05:18.320 --> 05:21.323
<i>Unlike Iris.</i>
<i>She already rented out your cabin.</i>

05:21.490 --> 05:24.200
That was nothing. But then what isn't?

05:24.367 --> 05:26.994
<i>He's so modest,</i>
<i>he could almost be British.</i>

05:27.161 --> 05:30.372
-Why the fuck did I say that?
-That stuff is neuro developmental.

05:30.539 --> 05:34.959
I was very, very proud of how Captain
Ryan followed my direction out there.

05:35.126 --> 05:36.836
You were out of depth on the bridge.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.756
<i>Yes, you're much better suited</i>
<i>in a secondary position.</i>

05:43.383 --> 05:47.136
Fucking balls!
Burn those suits, they smell like hell!

05:47.303 --> 05:50.055
-I can actually hear that smell.
-Dude...

05:50.222 --> 05:53.183
<i>Hey, beautiful, tonight at midnight,</i>
<i>we reach our furthest point from Earth</i>

05:53.350 --> 05:54.726
<i>and turn around to head back.</i>

05:54.893 --> 05:57.395
I know, time flies.
I don't want to go home, either.

05:57.562 --> 06:00.147
But I'll see you later
at the halfway-home party.

06:00.314 --> 06:02.774
Hey, is that true?

06:02.941 --> 06:05.777
Well, it was true when I said it.
Like a marriage vow.

06:05.944 --> 06:07.695
And you just kept this up.

06:07.862 --> 06:12.199
Sure, I mean we can still have
a 146th-of-the-way-home party.

06:12.366 --> 06:14.159
-Yeah, that could work.
-Spike gets it.

06:14.326 --> 06:16.369
We brought $200,000 worth of streamers.

06:16.536 --> 06:18.454
The only other use would be
for your funeral.

06:20.831 --> 06:24.126
-Hey, it's the shit whisperer.
Hey, Benjamin Button!

06:24.292 --> 06:27.086
-Shit stack walking.
-Frankenfuck!

06:27.253 --> 06:28.671
Mr. Crapatoa.

06:28.838 --> 06:33.008
Wow, couldn't you just stay
in this cabin all day?

06:33.175 --> 06:36.845
I mean, I know I could.
And I think you should.

06:38.554 --> 06:41.932
-Why?
-There's just so much to explore, baby.

06:42.099 --> 06:45.101
We have booze, right?
Who doesn't love booze?

06:45.268 --> 06:50.106
And, and four books, five books here,
I mean, that's just... Right?

06:50.272 --> 06:52.024
All I did was...

06:52.191 --> 06:54.151
And then they...

06:54.318 --> 06:55.735
And...

06:57.987 --> 06:59.447
Don't ever sit!

07:01.282 --> 07:03.283
Inflate one thousand balloons.

07:08.162 --> 07:10.623
I need to vet your materials
for this show this evening.

07:10.790 --> 07:13.000
Oh, wow, so it's true,
the show really does go on.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.335
It's in your contract,
you'd be doing a show tonight

07:15.502 --> 07:20.256
even if this was a burned-out hull full
of space junk and dead animals, so...

07:21.298 --> 07:23.175
Jokes.

07:23.342 --> 07:24.718
Do some.

07:24.885 --> 07:26.845
-Okay, what makes you laugh?
-Comedy.

07:27.012 --> 07:30.014
-Obviously.
-And sometimes tragedy.

07:30.181 --> 07:31.557
Light tragedy.

07:31.724 --> 07:35.227
Erectile dysfunction,
non-fatal hunting accidents,

07:35.394 --> 07:36.770
waving at someone you think you know,

07:36.937 --> 07:39.314
but it turns out to be a stranger,
that sort of thing.

07:39.480 --> 07:43.067
Now, make it topical.
Mention "it", but don't mention it.

07:43.233 --> 07:45.527
"It?" That's horrible.

07:46.570 --> 07:48.154
Go.

07:48.321 --> 07:50.490
-Okay, I can start with...
-It's not called sit-down.

07:59.580 --> 08:01.040
I can start with...

08:01.207 --> 08:02.666
This is some hot shit.

08:02.833 --> 08:05.043
You know it's actually extremely cold
in space?

08:05.210 --> 08:06.670
-Are you going to do this the whole way?
-Yes.

08:06.837 --> 08:09.214
And I'd say you're a heckler's wet dream
right now.

08:11.924 --> 08:14.426
You see what I did?
Did you... did you see?

08:14.593 --> 08:16.970
I put a fucking goldfish bowl
on my head,

08:17.137 --> 08:19.055
went out there, and fixed a spaceship!

08:19.222 --> 08:22.933
I know. I need you to make it clear
that it wasn't Frank's fault.

08:23.100 --> 08:25.060
-Who's Frank?
-My husband!

08:25.227 --> 08:27.479
Oh, do you mind
if we don't talk about him?

08:27.646 --> 08:30.648
He's only there to stop his skeleton
from falling over.

08:30.815 --> 08:34.693
Christ, I'm coming off my fucking nut.
I feel like I can kill and eat a man.

08:34.860 --> 08:38.488
Oh, God! Just fuck me
and don't even give me your name.

08:38.655 --> 08:42.366
Okay, so, somebody needs some soap
for their mouth

08:42.533 --> 08:45.160
and a hot totty for their mood. Sit.

08:46.787 --> 08:48.747
Chill.

08:48.913 --> 08:51.874
I just did something,
and I don't know what it was.

08:52.041 --> 08:55.252
I don't know what I'm doing.
I don't know how...

08:55.419 --> 08:57.587
Anybody knows what they’re doing.
Does anybody know what they’re doing?

08:57.754 --> 08:59.714
How does everything work?
Does anybody know?

08:59.881 --> 09:02.508
-I mean, who knows how that door works?
-It doesn't work.

09:02.675 --> 09:06.220
Well, I didn't even know
how it doesn't work. And look at this.

09:07.304 --> 09:13.059
I mean, how am I doing that? I do not
know how the fuck I'm doing that.

09:13.225 --> 09:16.103
-Drink this.
-Now... You see... See, orifices!

09:16.270 --> 09:19.064
They're all over us.
Well, that can't be safe, can it?

09:19.231 --> 09:22.233
You know what's ironic? I just left
a man who can't finish his sentence,

09:22.400 --> 09:25.361
and here you are,
and you just can't shut the F up.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.113
-Hi.
<i>-Hi.</i>

09:28.280 --> 09:32.450
-I feel a bit trapped.
<i>-Well honey, we're all trapped.</i>

09:32.617 --> 09:36.745
The sky is full of S-H-I-T.

09:36.912 --> 09:38.580
<i>Oh, no.</i>

09:38.747 --> 09:41.874
-There it floats.
-Bollocks!

09:43.668 --> 09:46.754
Oh, can everything just fuck off?

09:46.920 --> 09:49.965
Wait, is that... Was that Captain Ryan?

09:51.841 --> 09:54.051
It was not, in fact.

09:54.218 --> 09:57.638
I will be back soon, tootsie roll, okay?

10:01.057 --> 10:03.393
HALF WAY HOME

10:03.559 --> 10:06.854
I'll see you all tonight.
Bring your children.

10:07.021 --> 10:09.147
Unless they have behavioral disorders.

10:09.314 --> 10:11.232
And bring them, too. It's a party.

10:17.446 --> 10:19.364
Hey, I don't want
to get you overexcited,

10:19.531 --> 10:22.242
but this party is going to be
an orgy of the gods.

10:22.408 --> 10:25.286
I don't get overexcited. I'm always
on the same fucking level of excited.

10:25.453 --> 10:27.496
-Right, Iris?
-Yes.

10:27.663 --> 10:29.456
I'll have another shot of water please?

10:29.623 --> 10:32.834
All right, let's go yell
in some people's faces!

10:36.337 --> 10:39.548
I'm so sorry, please enjoy
this Judd voucher.

10:39.715 --> 10:42.300
I apologize, these are valid
anywhere on the ship.

10:42.467 --> 10:45.052
Take the French fries. Leave the beer.

10:45.219 --> 10:48.472
I'm so sorry, these are valid everywhere
on the ship except the golf course.

10:48.639 --> 10:50.057
Oh, really? Can I get one of those?

10:50.223 --> 10:53.476
-Oh, hey, Billie. You look nice.
-Hey. So do you.

10:53.643 --> 10:56.520
I decided to go for
"I just saved the ship casual".

10:56.687 --> 10:58.355
-We just saved the ship.
-What did I say?

10:58.522 --> 11:01.942
-Yeah. "We".
-Oh, hey, come on.

11:02.108 --> 11:04.360
-Stop that.
-Stop. Stop. Stop it.

11:04.527 --> 11:08.405
-Thank you! We were just doing our job.
-I was just doing my job.

11:08.572 --> 11:11.825
-We just did what we had to do.
-I did what I had to do.

11:11.992 --> 11:14.452
Yes. Yes. Did you see me out there?

11:14.619 --> 11:16.495
Do you understand I have not slept
a wink since you freaked me out?

11:16.662 --> 11:19.915
I'm writing my jokes on tissue paper.
Who does that these days?

11:20.082 --> 11:22.000
We can delay the start by five minutes.

11:23.293 --> 11:27.129
Are you sure it's safe for me here?
I'm getting sneering looks.

11:27.296 --> 11:30.924
Oh, honey, relax. Everybody's here
to celebrate Captain Ryan.

11:31.091 --> 11:34.135
Oh, my God, he looks amazing
in that turtleneck.

11:34.302 --> 11:38.139
Listen, with him wearing that, I
guarantee nobody is thinking about you.

11:38.305 --> 11:40.224
We make a really great team.

11:40.390 --> 11:43.601
You saving the ship,
and me thanking you for that.

11:43.768 --> 11:46.270
Yeah. I mean, you know,
they were probably live streaming

11:46.437 --> 11:49.940
the whole thing all over the world.
So, right now, I'm probably more famous

11:50.107 --> 11:51.983
than that guy who shat his pants
at the Superbowl.

11:52.150 --> 11:53.693
-Daniel Radcliffe?
-Yeah.

11:53.860 --> 11:56.362
-Those two are an item.
-Those two?

11:56.529 --> 11:58.864
-Yeah. Yeah.
-No. No way. Nuh-uh.

11:59.031 --> 12:01.283
No, she's not his type.

12:01.450 --> 12:02.909
I mean, I think he would...

12:03.076 --> 12:05.453
I think he would probably want
an older woman.

12:05.620 --> 12:09.123
You know, a woman who's more,
like, mature.

12:09.290 --> 12:12.000
The way I see it,
like, 2500 women on board?

12:12.167 --> 12:16.045
At least 700 of them I would totally
want a consensual meeting with.

12:16.212 --> 12:19.632
-Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah.
-I'll get some informed consent tonight.

12:19.798 --> 12:23.468
Just some sweet, sweet informed consent
from a strong autonomous woman...

12:23.635 --> 12:27.638
Hey guys, did you hear that? I think
that was the sound of 700 vaginas

12:27.805 --> 12:30.140
-snapping shut.
-It's not.

12:30.307 --> 12:34.185
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I am horny as hell,

12:34.352 --> 12:37.230
so I am going to go out
and get my body slammed.

12:37.396 --> 12:40.441
And it's okay that she said.
We're separated.

12:40.607 --> 12:42.526
They just haven't found me
my own cabin yet.

12:42.693 --> 12:44.527
-We should...
-Yeah, we should.

12:44.694 --> 12:46.487
I'll freshen up and see you down there.

12:46.654 --> 12:49.532
-That means he has to have a little cry.
-I really don't.

12:49.698 --> 12:51.867
-Shots?
-You know, I usually don't drink

12:52.034 --> 12:53.702
because it makes me blunt
and opinionated.

12:53.869 --> 12:55.245
As opposed to?

12:55.412 --> 12:59.081
Hey, everyone. Welcome
to the Halfway Home party.

13:00.124 --> 13:03.418
Now, in a second, I'm going to bring out
our comedian for the evening.

13:03.585 --> 13:08.256
His name's Jordan Hatwal.
He is extremely nervous, okay?

13:08.422 --> 13:11.133
But I know you guys are going
to love him, right?

13:12.968 --> 13:15.720
Okay, okay, I think that's probably
gonna make him more nervous

13:15.887 --> 13:18.973
because it was pretty underwhelming.
Let's try it again, right?

13:19.140 --> 13:22.267
-Are you excited for Jordan Hatwal?
-Yeah!

13:23.727 --> 13:27.188
Okay, okay. Okay, I don't think
he can live up to that.

13:27.355 --> 13:31.609
You know, if he was that good, he would
probably be doing arena shows on Earth.

13:31.775 --> 13:35.654
But now that I've lowered
your expectations again,

13:35.820 --> 13:38.281
I think you might be
pleasantly surprised

13:38.448 --> 13:42.326
by the competent, workman-like comedy
of Jordan Hatwal.

13:42.493 --> 13:46.996
But before he comes out to win you over
or die horribly,

13:47.163 --> 13:52.793
I want to give a big round of applause
to our heroes, Captain Ryan Clark!

14:01.050 --> 14:03.093
-And...
-Billie McEvoy!

14:03.260 --> 14:06.179
...former astronaut, Spike Martin.

14:06.346 --> 14:07.722
What?

14:10.891 --> 14:13.811
-Okay. Jordan, are you ready to go?
-Yep.

14:13.977 --> 14:16.896
-Listen to him. He's nervous, right?
-Yeah!

14:17.063 --> 14:19.190
Okay! Please put your hands together,

14:19.357 --> 14:23.902
or silently reserve judgment,
for Jordan Hatwal!

14:26.780 --> 14:29.157
All right. Hey, how you going?

14:30.658 --> 14:32.910
I've been asleep for the last 120 hours,
what'd I miss?

14:33.077 --> 14:35.245
-We're stuck up here for three years.
-Okay, guys.

14:35.412 --> 14:38.540
That was his first joke,
so you can laugh. It's okay to laugh.

14:38.706 --> 14:41.751
-Matt.
-I'm just... I'm just trying to help.

14:41.917 --> 14:45.003
Yeah, it's hard doing
a halfway-home gig when...

14:45.170 --> 14:46.546
I mean, we're not even halfway...

14:46.713 --> 14:48.381
-I vetoed that angle.
-Okay.

14:48.548 --> 14:52.009
Guys, pretend that we're 21 months
into the voyage, right.

14:52.176 --> 14:54.720
-Is that helpful?
-No.

14:54.887 --> 14:56.388
It doesn't... It's not helpful.

14:56.555 --> 14:58.431
Do you want... Do you want
to come up here and do the set?

14:58.598 --> 15:01.851
-Sure, yeah.
-I wasn't actually asking.

15:02.018 --> 15:05.062
-You were joking?
-Yep, that was a joke.

15:05.229 --> 15:08.481
It's what I'm here to do.
It's like the joke police over here.

15:08.648 --> 15:14.069
-Anyway, shoehorns. Pretty weird, no?
-Yes!

15:15.988 --> 15:19.449
-Thank you for your service.
-You're real-life heroes!

15:19.616 --> 15:21.659
-People loved us.
-No, no, no. No, I'm sorry, no.

15:21.826 --> 15:24.453
I don't get it. I just don't...
I don't get this, this...

15:24.620 --> 15:28.206
I arm wrestled with space and I won,
so that was me.

15:28.373 --> 15:31.667
Speaking of arms, yours are so firm.

15:31.834 --> 15:35.129
How do you find gym time
in between saving lives?

15:36.296 --> 15:40.842
-Well, firm is my middle name.
-What's your first name?

15:41.009 --> 15:43.010
-Colin.
-Colin Firm.

15:43.177 --> 15:47.806
-Yeah, Colin Firm Erbifritz.
-Oh, is that Italian?

15:47.973 --> 15:49.808
-No, it's actually... Okay.
-Oh, who cares. Okay.

15:49.974 --> 15:52.893
Oh! Guess who else will be
on the prowl tonight?

15:53.060 --> 15:56.105
Captain Ryan Clark,
ladies and gentlemen!

15:56.271 --> 15:59.316
He's as horny and as hairy as a tomcat

15:59.482 --> 16:04.361
and I should know because back
in the day, he put a baby up me.

16:05.738 --> 16:09.115
Was your oxygen restricted
in your early developmental years?

16:09.282 --> 16:12.493
Oh, you can't wash
the shame away, Frank.

16:12.660 --> 16:15.829
Next time, leave it
to the professionals, you silly man!

16:15.996 --> 16:20.041
Why can't the captain be a womanizer?
Or a maninizer?

16:20.208 --> 16:22.418
He can do what he wants.
I actually don't care at this point.

16:22.585 --> 16:25.421
-Captain Clark is a sex man?
-He's a dog.

16:25.588 --> 16:30.383
Hey, fuck it, shall we start the conga?
Let's do a conga. Frank, come on.

16:30.550 --> 16:33.010
<i>Allez!</i>

16:33.177 --> 16:35.429
<i>He cannot press a button</i>

16:37.472 --> 16:41.392
<i>-He cannot press a button</i>
-Come on, let's get out of here.

16:41.559 --> 16:44.103
<i>-He always fucks it up</i>
<i>-Fucks it up!</i>

16:44.270 --> 16:47.356
-Check it.
-I'm so sorry.

16:47.523 --> 16:49.941
First person that's laughed
in quite some time.

16:50.108 --> 16:52.860
-Hey, you want to come back to my place?
-Sure, I'll take it where I can get it.

16:53.027 --> 16:55.779
-A hole's a hole.
-Oh, no, thank you.

16:55.946 --> 16:57.906
I have a flight simulation game
I would love to play with you.

16:58.073 --> 16:59.658
-It'd be an honor, sir.
-Oh, well, okay, well,

16:59.825 --> 17:02.785
batten down the sexual hatches,
let's fly some ships.

17:04.453 --> 17:08.957
So, do you remember the phones
that you had to plug in to charge?

17:09.124 --> 17:14.127
-Yes, I do.
-Yeah, well, they...

17:14.295 --> 17:15.671
They were...

17:18.048 --> 17:20.509
No, no. That one's gone.

17:20.675 --> 17:22.719
Just give it a second, because this
could be good when you think of it.

17:22.886 --> 17:25.429
-They had a cord.
-They had a cord, yeah.

17:25.596 --> 17:28.473
I don't think
that was the punchline though.

17:28.640 --> 17:30.642
Promote the beer!

17:33.603 --> 17:35.146
-Hey.
<i>-You can tell from our expressions</i>

17:35.313 --> 17:37.439
<i>-that we need to talk face to face...</i>
-Uh, no, no, no, you're talking.

17:37.606 --> 17:40.233
You should know because I called you,
so you should really wait and...

17:40.400 --> 17:42.694
-Anyway, it doesn't matter.
<i>-Ryan, we have to tell you something.</i>

17:42.861 --> 17:45.404
-I know, it was impressive.
-Well, it's not bad.

17:45.571 --> 17:47.156
What do you mean "bad"?

17:47.323 --> 17:52.118
<i>We love you, but we didn't sign up</i>
<i>for three and a half years, and...</i>

17:52.285 --> 17:53.745
<i>with that crazy spacewalk?</i>

17:53.911 --> 17:55.913
-You're looking at a hero basically.
<i>-We can't...</i>

17:56.080 --> 17:58.290
<i>-We can't take the stress.</i>
-The what?

17:58.457 --> 18:00.208
<i>You lose the plot, you lose your slot.</i>

18:00.375 --> 18:04.337
"Slot?" This is a marriage,
not a fucking squash court!

18:04.504 --> 18:07.548
We're getting trivorced.
Two thirds majority. Motion carried.

18:07.715 --> 18:09.633
What about our vows?
"Hand in hand in hand?"

18:13.720 --> 18:17.473
And then I downed it in one
and I threw up on her dress.

18:18.515 --> 18:24.520
That’s the end of prom
and that's the first time I had a drink.

18:24.687 --> 18:29.149
But it was a Judd Light, and Judd Light
is available throughout the ship.

18:29.316 --> 18:32.277
It's a liquid party.

18:33.903 --> 18:36.030
I'm right in here.

18:36.197 --> 18:38.824
What are you doing? What?

18:38.991 --> 18:40.951
-Just going to my room.
-Why are you here?

18:41.118 --> 18:43.661
-It's my room.
-You trying to trick us into a foursome,

18:43.828 --> 18:45.204
there's no tricking needed.

18:45.371 --> 18:48.707
-This isn't a foursome, it's a twosome.
-I'm easy.

18:48.874 --> 18:51.251
-You guys stay here.
-What? I...

18:51.418 --> 18:54.003
-Why did you bring the peat bog man?
-We're going on my flight simulator.

18:54.170 --> 18:56.881
You need to vacate the room,
because I'll be making love everywhere.

18:57.048 --> 18:59.091
Yeah, we could go to your room.

18:59.258 --> 19:01.593
-Can I keep that as a back-up?
-Oh, sure, yeah.

19:01.760 --> 19:03.178
Give them a minute, see what pans out.

19:03.345 --> 19:05.346
-Colin Firm get in here!
-What?

19:05.513 --> 19:08.057
Sorry, Doug, the viewing gallery
is closed.

19:09.141 --> 19:10.934
Come here, let's just do it here.

19:11.101 --> 19:13.395
-No.
-No, no. Just do it quickly before he...

19:13.562 --> 19:14.979
-Just do it. Do it!
-Okay, who cares about him?

19:15.146 --> 19:16.898
-Do you want it? Do you want it?
-Do it! Do it! Do it!

19:17.064 --> 19:19.817
-Don't be a pussy, Colin!
-I'm sorry, I wasn't trained for this.

19:19.984 --> 19:21.652
-I'm sorry.
-This reminds me of my last days

19:21.818 --> 19:24.112
of the International Space station.
That was a scene.

19:26.197 --> 19:29.366
I ruined it for her, so I won.

19:30.868 --> 19:33.495
So, my last relationship
didn't end well.

19:33.662 --> 19:36.080
But then in some ways,
you can say it did.

19:36.247 --> 19:38.749
Because my girlfriend fell down a well.

19:38.916 --> 19:43.462
-Gravity, what a downer.
-No, no, no, no. No. No.

19:43.628 --> 19:47.590
-Hey, it's Mr. Judd everyone.
-No, no, hold your applause.

19:47.757 --> 19:52.427
Four people died because of that gravity
fail. Don't joke about stuff like that.

19:54.596 --> 19:57.598
Maybe that's why your girlfriend
jumped down that well,

19:57.765 --> 20:00.309
because of those kinds of jokes.

20:00.476 --> 20:04.938
-She didn't. She just left me.
-I was going to say a few words later,

20:05.105 --> 20:09.150
but now that... sucked
all the good energy out of the room

20:09.317 --> 20:15.780
and just flushed it out into space like
<i>fuh-barg, </i> I'm just going to read it now.

20:18.574 --> 20:20.618
"As you know, this was meant to be
the halfway point,

20:20.784 --> 20:22.661
but we're not halfway.

20:22.828 --> 20:26.623
And yet in so many ways,
we're more than halfway."

20:26.790 --> 20:28.624
-Iris, who wrote this?
-I did.

20:28.791 --> 20:31.085
And is it like this all the way through,
or does it get any better?

20:31.252 --> 20:33.462
Well, that was the best part
and you kind of threw it away.

20:33.629 --> 20:36.881
Fuck! All right.

20:37.048 --> 20:41.844
"Because we've come a long way,
and I'm proud of you and of me,

20:42.011 --> 20:44.805
and I'm inspired by you and me."

20:46.598 --> 20:48.725
I'm just going to skip to the end.

20:48.891 --> 20:52.019
All right. "We can do this, we're
nearly there, we're not, but we are!"

21:02.111 --> 21:03.987
Ever been to Buffalo before?

21:04.154 --> 21:06.823
It's changed a lot since they moved
the White House there for a start...

21:06.990 --> 21:09.117
Shut up!

21:09.283 --> 21:13.412
Alan, this better not be bad news. I...
What the fuck is that?

21:13.579 --> 21:16.831
<i>I'm afraid some</i>
<i>of the residual matter</i>

21:16.998 --> 21:19.625
has escaped
the ship's gravitational pull.

21:21.544 --> 21:25.505
-Okay, well, it's a ring of shit.
-Yeah.

21:25.672 --> 21:28.091
-"A ring of shit?"
-Could you just... Back to the book.

21:28.258 --> 21:30.801
On the upside, you can't see
the coffins anymore.

21:30.968 --> 21:32.845
No, there's one.

21:34.930 --> 21:38.099
Get ready to pretend
we're 10 minutes to halfway there!

21:40.226 --> 21:42.186
-Can I get one of those?
-Sure.

21:42.353 --> 21:46.481
Billie, don't ever, ever show anyone
your feelings.

21:46.648 --> 21:49.234
Right? Just bury them
as deep as you can.

21:49.400 --> 21:53.112
Scrunch them up into a little tiny ball
and then just...

21:53.279 --> 21:55.697
Grow a couple of ulcers
if you want to mark the spot,

21:55.864 --> 21:59.617
but otherwise just smile
and say that everything is fine.

21:59.784 --> 22:02.495
-You're not a happy drunk.
-I'm not a happy anything.

22:04.538 --> 22:05.914
-Hi, there. Hey.
-Hey there.

22:06.081 --> 22:08.792
Why is the shit still outside there?

22:08.958 --> 22:12.586
Iris! It's getting thicker.

22:12.753 --> 22:15.130
We're working on it.

22:15.297 --> 22:19.384
All right, it's Mr. Judd, everybody.
Give it up.

22:19.551 --> 22:20.927
Yeah, it's on. I know it's on.

22:21.094 --> 22:24.805
You're going to have to compensate us
for this. This is your fault!

22:24.972 --> 22:28.099
I mean, it's Frank's fault.
He hit the big brown button.

22:28.266 --> 22:32.186
You mean shit the button.
You see, that's comedy, man.

22:32.353 --> 22:35.439
That right there is comedy, word play.
I love it.

22:35.606 --> 22:39.484
Hey, Frank, what if I came
and took a shit outside of your room?

22:39.651 --> 22:43.112
The shit is already outside my room.

22:43.279 --> 22:47.282
Okay, then I'll come take a shit
inside your room.

22:47.449 --> 22:49.826
I'll pay for the cleanup,
so you can do it again tomorrow.

22:51.619 --> 22:54.413
We should shit Frank out the airlock.

22:54.580 --> 22:57.165
You hurt him without my consent
and involvement,

22:57.332 --> 22:59.668
and I will harm you deeply!

22:59.834 --> 23:02.128
Shit him out!

23:02.295 --> 23:04.755
Shit him out!

23:04.922 --> 23:07.216
Shit him out!

23:07.382 --> 23:10.969
-Shit him out! Shit him out!
-Guys, come on. Calm down!

23:11.135 --> 23:13.346
-Shit him out!
-Hey, who remembers the last Oscars?

23:13.512 --> 23:14.889
-That was a real shit show, wasn't it?
-Shit him out!

23:15.055 --> 23:17.766
-They gave an award to a sparrow.
-Shit him out! Shit him out!

23:17.933 --> 23:20.518
Is there a whistle you can blow
that can keep him under control?

23:20.685 --> 23:23.854
When he gets like this, it's best
just to let him wear himself out.

23:24.021 --> 23:27.316
Security, shit him the shit out
of the airlock and into the shit!

23:27.482 --> 23:31.236
You need to shut the F up,
before I knock you the F...

23:31.402 --> 23:33.529
-Shit him out! Shit him out!
-Frank! Frank!

23:33.696 --> 23:36.198
-Shit him out! Shit him out!
-Frank! Frank!

23:36.365 --> 23:38.283
-Frank! Frank!
-Shit him out!

23:38.450 --> 23:40.869
-Shit him out!
-Frank! Put him down, he's mine!

23:41.035 --> 23:43.913
-Shit him out! Shit him out!
-No! Stop murdering someone!

23:44.080 --> 23:47.499
-Frank!
-Shit him out! Shit him out!

23:47.666 --> 23:49.209
Do something!

23:51.002 --> 23:53.671
Well, I guess things are looking up
for... Oh, thank fuck!

23:58.300 --> 24:03.179
Calm, and I cannot stress this enough,
the fuck down!

24:04.513 --> 24:09.184
Mr. Judd did not mean shit anybody out,
he was making a joke.

24:09.351 --> 24:14.188
Yeah. Yeah.
You guys don't understand comedy. I do.

24:14.355 --> 24:17.149
What I did back there,
that was comedy. Idiots.

24:17.316 --> 24:21.361
Yeah, but right, and the comedy was,
may I say, exquisitely performed,

24:21.528 --> 24:26.866
unlike this guy who I assume was abused
by a punchline when he was a kid.

24:28.033 --> 24:29.534
-Oh, come on!
-Taking his revenge.

24:29.701 --> 24:31.077
Do you mind? Please?

24:31.244 --> 24:34.831
Security, can we bring Frank
back down? Right?

24:34.997 --> 24:38.333
-Let's bring Frank back down.
-Thank God!

24:38.500 --> 24:44.422
Thank you. And can we render him
vertical? There we go.

24:44.589 --> 24:47.341
Okay, now, do you know
what's gonna get us out of this?

24:47.508 --> 24:51.261
-A big rocket?
-No. Well, yes, that would be...

24:51.428 --> 24:53.763
Okay, there's two ways
we can get out of this.

24:53.930 --> 24:58.142
Captain Ryan saved you, okay?
So, you just owe him a big handshake.

24:58.309 --> 25:03.021
-Go on. Go ahead.
-We work together as a team, all right?

25:03.188 --> 25:05.481
Like the Egyptians
building the pyramids.

25:05.648 --> 25:08.817
We can be like bricks
in one of those Mexican palaces

25:08.984 --> 25:11.236
with the steps up the side,
we climb the steps...

25:13.071 --> 25:14.530
Frank!

25:14.697 --> 25:17.825
You stay away from my wife, you jackal!

25:17.992 --> 25:21.745
Or you will have me
and my wife to deal with!

25:21.912 --> 25:24.164
Got it? Captain Turtleneck?

25:24.330 --> 25:26.332
-Frank. That was wrong.
-Honey!

25:26.499 --> 25:28.042
Hot, but wrong!

25:28.209 --> 25:30.169
<i>-We're 10 seconds from halfway home.</i>
-So, it's funny, isn't it?

25:30.335 --> 25:33.088
You call them elevators,
but they just don't elevate.

25:33.254 --> 25:36.007
-They also lower.
-...seven, zero!

25:36.174 --> 25:38.092
Yeah!

25:39.218 --> 25:44.806
<i>We're halfway home! Let's party so loud,</i>
<i>they hear us back on Earth.</i>

25:44.973 --> 25:47.016
Who threw that? You are a dead man.

25:47.183 --> 25:49.059
All right, or woman.
Let's not be sexist.

25:49.226 --> 25:50.853
But actually, no, it was a man.
It was him there.

25:51.895 --> 25:54.147
Not him. Him.

25:56.566 --> 25:58.442
-This is all on you!
-What?

25:58.609 --> 26:01.737
You had one job. I expect,
I'm not sure exactly what you do.

26:01.903 --> 26:04.697
I saved everybody, so I think
the words you're looking for are,

26:04.864 --> 26:08.576
"Thank you, Billie", and "I'm sorry
I've got a rod up my metal ass".

26:08.743 --> 26:11.912
I hope you're trampled
by this conga line...

26:12.079 --> 26:15.707
Iris, I'll be in my cabin
with a protein ball and a gun.

26:15.873 --> 26:17.875
-Yes, Mr. Judd...
-Iris!

26:18.042 --> 26:19.585
I heard you!

26:21.086 --> 26:22.504
Well, I think that's my time.

26:22.671 --> 26:27.175
So, thanks for coming everyone
to see the funniest man in the universe.

26:27.341 --> 26:30.052
That's me, in case it wasn't clear.

26:30.219 --> 26:33.972
I think everything will be okay
if we just stick together.

26:35.098 --> 26:38.142
Worked for every extinct species
in history.

26:38.309 --> 26:39.810
What a crazy night, right?

26:41.395 --> 26:43.313
Knock, knock.

26:45.106 --> 26:46.482
Knock, knock.

26:50.736 --> 26:54.197
These people are the bravest
and the boldest.

26:54.364 --> 26:58.159
They are humanity's finest
and they need safe...

27:08.126 --> 27:10.628
-The president will see you now.
-Great.

27:12.296 --> 27:15.048
Jordan is goona be signing
merchandise at the bar.

27:15.215 --> 27:17.133
I'm just kidding. He's in hiding.
