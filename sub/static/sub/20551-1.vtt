03:42.223 --> 03:48.438
<i>Guenevere, Guenevere</i>

03:48.605 --> 03:54.611
<i>In that dim, mournful year</i>

03:54.777 --> 04:01.034
<i>Saw the men she held so dear</i>

04:01.200 --> 04:08.041
<i>Go to war for Guenevere</i>

04:21.095 --> 04:24.390
The rules of battle are not for
Lancelot Du Lac, Your Majesty.

04:24.599 --> 04:26.476
Let us attack now while they sleep.

04:28.770 --> 04:33.191
We will attack when
I give the command, at dawn.

04:45.870 --> 04:47.205
Merlyn...

04:48.790 --> 04:51.250
...why is Jenny in that castle...

04:51.459 --> 04:54.671
...behind walls I cannot enter?

04:55.964 --> 04:59.175
How did I blunder into this...

04:59.801 --> 05:02.387
...agonizing absurdity?

05:06.975 --> 05:10.895
When did I stumble?
Where did I go wrong?

05:13.898 --> 05:16.734
Should I not have loved her?

05:18.987 --> 05:22.240
Then I should not have been...

05:22.699 --> 05:24.075
...born.

05:24.617 --> 05:25.994
Oh, Merlyn...

05:27.161 --> 05:29.414
...how did it happen?

05:29.998 --> 05:32.000
I haven't got much time.

05:34.168 --> 05:36.587
A thin inch of sunlight...

05:36.754 --> 05:39.549
...the arrows begin to fly.

05:42.510 --> 05:43.845
Merlyn...

05:44.345 --> 05:48.099
...if I am to die...

05:48.307 --> 05:49.726
...in battle...

05:52.520 --> 05:55.857
...please do not let me die...

05:56.065 --> 05:57.692
...bewildered.

06:01.362 --> 06:02.947
<i>Think, Arthur.</i>

06:03.156 --> 06:04.949
<i>Think back.</i>

06:22.717 --> 06:24.135
Think back.

06:24.302 --> 06:25.887
Think back!

06:26.888 --> 06:28.765
Oh, Merlyn!

06:31.059 --> 06:32.643
Think back.

06:32.810 --> 06:34.771
Think back!

06:36.898 --> 06:38.316
Think...

06:38.483 --> 06:39.984
...back.

06:40.902 --> 06:45.531
Back! To one of the most
important days of your life.

06:47.033 --> 06:48.785
Oh, yes, heh!

06:56.250 --> 06:57.376
Hello.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.094
My name is Arthur.

07:06.427 --> 07:08.721
I think I'll call you...

07:09.347 --> 07:10.389
...Wart.

07:11.265 --> 07:13.476
"I think I'll call you Wart."

07:15.269 --> 07:16.813
No, no, no!

07:17.021 --> 07:19.357
Now you've gone too far back.

07:19.649 --> 07:22.360
Shoo, shoo, shoo!

07:23.402 --> 07:25.571
Not the day you met me!

07:26.114 --> 07:29.367
The day you met Guenevere.

07:30.952 --> 07:33.121
The day she came...

07:33.454 --> 07:35.039
...to Camelot.

07:37.125 --> 07:39.377
That's the beginning.

07:45.049 --> 07:46.551
Yes.

08:21.711 --> 08:23.296
I know...

08:23.546 --> 08:25.131
...what my people...

08:25.339 --> 08:27.425
...are thinking tonight.

08:27.842 --> 08:29.552
<i>I know what my people</i>

08:29.719 --> 08:31.429
<i>Are thinking tonight</i>

08:32.013 --> 08:35.765
<i>As home through the shadows
They wander</i>

08:36.851 --> 08:41.022
<i>Everyone smiling in secret delight</i>

08:41.522 --> 08:44.692
<i>As they stare at the castle and ponder</i>

08:46.360 --> 08:49.864
<i>Whenever the wind blows this way</i>

08:50.698 --> 08:54.660
<i>You can almost hear everyone say...</i>

08:57.205 --> 09:00.708
<i>...I wonder what the king
Is doing tonight</i>

09:00.917 --> 09:04.045
<i>What merriment is the king
Pursuing tonight?</i>

09:04.378 --> 09:07.548
<i>The candles at the court
They never burned as bright</i>

09:07.882 --> 09:10.885
<i>I wonder what the king
Is up to tonight</i>

09:11.219 --> 09:14.889
<i>How goes the final hour
As he sees the bridal bower</i>

09:15.223 --> 09:17.558
<i>Being legally and regally prepared?</i>

09:18.392 --> 09:21.896
<i>Well, I'll tell you what the king
Is doing tonight</i>

09:22.104 --> 09:25.233
<i>He's scared Oh, he's scared</i>

09:27.735 --> 09:31.656
<i>You mean that a king who fought a dragon
Whacked him in two and fixed his wagon</i>

09:31.822 --> 09:34.742
<i>Goes to wed in terror and distress?</i>

09:34.992 --> 09:36.452
<i>Oh, yes!</i>

09:36.744 --> 09:40.414
<i>A warrior who's so calm in battle
Even his armor doesn't rattle</i>

09:40.748 --> 09:42.917
<i>Faces a woman petrified with fright?</i>

09:44.043 --> 09:45.086
<i>Right!</i>

09:45.753 --> 09:49.090
<i>You mean the appalling clamoring
That sounds like a blacksmith hammering</i>

09:49.423 --> 09:52.718
<i>Is merely the banging
Of his royal knees?</i>

09:52.969 --> 09:54.512
<i>Please!</i>

09:54.929 --> 09:58.432
<i>You wonder what the king
Is wishing tonight?</i>

09:58.766 --> 10:01.936
<i>He's wishing he were
In Scotland fishing tonight</i>

10:02.270 --> 10:05.773
<i>What occupies his time
While waiting for his bride?</i>

10:06.107 --> 10:09.360
<i>He's searching high and low
For someplace to hide</i>

10:09.777 --> 10:12.613
<i>And, oh, the expectation
The sublime anticipation</i>

10:12.947 --> 10:15.783
<i>He must feel about
The wedding night to come</i>

10:16.784 --> 10:20.454
<i>Well, I'll tell you what the king
Is feeling tonight</i>

10:20.788 --> 10:24.458
<i>He's numb! He shakes!
He quails! He quakes!</i>

10:24.792 --> 10:27.795
<i>And that's what the king is doing</i>

10:34.343 --> 10:35.720
<i>Tonight!</i>

11:03.456 --> 11:05.583
How long before we get to Camelot?

11:05.791 --> 11:09.503
Soon, ma'am, but don't look out there,
it's a ghastly forest.

11:10.129 --> 11:12.965
It's the most ferocious, savage...

11:13.632 --> 11:16.260
...terrifying forest I've ever seen.

11:17.136 --> 11:19.597
I simply adore it.

11:19.764 --> 11:24.143
Does Your Ladyship not realize
that this forest is crawling...

11:24.477 --> 11:26.479
...with outlaws and brigands?

11:26.645 --> 11:29.357
Oh, Clary! You think there's
a chance of meeting one?

11:30.316 --> 11:31.609
Don't say it, ma'am.

11:32.526 --> 11:34.820
It would be marvelous.

11:36.614 --> 11:41.285
Imagine, ma'am, soon you will
not only meet the man you will marry...

11:41.494 --> 11:44.789
...but His Majesty,
King Arthur of England.

11:44.997 --> 11:48.501
And one is the other.
What have you to say to that?

11:49.418 --> 11:51.504
Oh, Clary.

11:51.670 --> 11:55.716
Was there ever a more
inconvenient marriage of convenience?

11:56.509 --> 12:00.471
I am at the golden age of seductability,
and is my fate sealed with a kiss?

12:00.763 --> 12:03.140
Is it?
No, sealed with a seal!

12:08.687 --> 12:11.023
<i>Where are all the simple joys</i>

12:11.190 --> 12:12.858
<i>Of maidenhood?</i>

12:13.692 --> 12:18.197
<i>Where are all those
Adoring, daring boys?</i>

12:19.365 --> 12:22.535
<i>Where's the knight pining so for me?</i>

12:22.868 --> 12:26.038
<i>He leaps to death in woe for me</i>

12:26.539 --> 12:30.835
<i>Oh where are a maiden's simple joys?</i>

12:32.711 --> 12:37.049
<i>Shan't I have the normal life
A maiden should?</i>

12:38.008 --> 12:42.388
<i>Shall I never be rescued in the wood?</i>

12:43.722 --> 12:47.059
<i>Shall two knights never tilt for me</i>

12:47.393 --> 12:50.563
<i>And let their blood be spilt for me?</i>

12:51.230 --> 12:53.899
<i>Oh, where are the simple joys</i>

12:54.233 --> 12:56.902
<i>Of maidenhood?</i>

12:58.070 --> 13:01.240
<i>Shall I never be disputed for</i>

13:01.907 --> 13:04.577
<i>Or on any minstrel's lips?</i>

13:05.578 --> 13:09.457
<i>Never have my face recruited for</i>

13:09.915 --> 13:14.211
<i>Launching countless ships?</i>

13:16.255 --> 13:20.593
<i>Where are the simple joys
Of maidenhood?</i>

13:21.427 --> 13:25.764
<i>Are those sweet, gentle pleasures
Gone for good?</i>

13:27.266 --> 13:30.227
<i>Shall a feud not begin for me?</i>

13:30.394 --> 13:33.939
<i>Shall kith not kill their kin for me?</i>

13:34.607 --> 13:38.444
<i>Oh where are the trivial joys?</i>

13:39.445 --> 13:43.282
<i>Harmless, convivial joys?</i>

13:44.116 --> 13:46.952
<i>Where are the simple joys</i>

13:47.286 --> 13:50.372
<i>Of maidenhood?</i>

13:50.915 --> 13:51.957
Halt!

13:52.291 --> 13:55.794
Her Highness will rest here
while the Royal Hairdresser...

13:56.086 --> 13:57.421
...attends her.

13:57.630 --> 14:00.174
Can someone help with this canopy?

14:00.341 --> 14:02.927
Take that case down
and bring it over here.

14:03.093 --> 14:04.762
Hurry up now, would you, please?

14:04.929 --> 14:06.639
Careful now.

14:07.014 --> 14:08.891
Clarinda.

14:11.477 --> 14:14.563
I should like some tea
while I'm being coifed.

14:14.730 --> 14:16.774
Yes, Your Highness.

14:16.941 --> 14:18.817
Can he get somebody to help there?

14:18.984 --> 14:22.196
You, you come over here and help me.

14:24.949 --> 14:28.160
Bring that horse over here.
He needs water.

14:56.897 --> 14:58.857
St. Genevieve.

15:00.651 --> 15:03.028
<i>St. Genevieve</i>

15:04.363 --> 15:06.365
<i>It's Guenevere</i>

15:08.033 --> 15:09.368
Remember me?

15:10.786 --> 15:12.580
<i>St. Genevieve</i>

15:13.247 --> 15:15.332
<i>St. Genevieve</i>

15:16.375 --> 15:19.003
I'm over here, beneath this tree!

15:20.254 --> 15:23.382
<i>You know how faithful and devout I am</i>

15:24.383 --> 15:27.595
<i>You must admit
I've always been a lamb</i>

15:29.722 --> 15:33.058
<i>But Genevieve, St. Genevieve</i>

15:35.060 --> 15:38.355
<i>I won't obey you anymore
You've gone a bit too far</i>

15:38.564 --> 15:41.817
<i>I won't be bid and bargained for
Like beads at a bazaar</i>

15:42.192 --> 15:44.945
<i>St. Genevieve, I've run away
Eluded them and fled</i>

15:45.904 --> 15:50.034
<i>And from now on I intend
To pray to someone else instead</i>

15:56.081 --> 15:59.752
<i>Oh, Genevieve, St. Genevieve</i>

16:01.587 --> 16:05.090
<i>Where were you
When my youth was sold?</i>

16:07.426 --> 16:09.595
<i>Dear Genevieve</i>

16:10.596 --> 16:12.806
<i>Sweet Genevieve</i>

16:13.766 --> 16:19.647
<i>Shan't I be young before I'm old?</i>

16:23.609 --> 16:25.319
A thousand pardons, my lady.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.154
Don't run, I won't harm you.

16:27.363 --> 16:29.948
You lie! You'll leap on me
and throw me down!

16:30.449 --> 16:31.825
I'll do no such thing.

16:32.034 --> 16:34.286
You'll carry me off on your shoulder!

16:34.495 --> 16:37.581
No, I swear by the sword Excalibur
I won't touch you.

16:38.916 --> 16:39.958
Why not?

16:40.292 --> 16:44.129
How dare you insult me in this fashion?
Do my looks repel you?

16:44.630 --> 16:48.217
- No, you're beautiful!
- Did you hear me praying?

16:48.425 --> 16:50.636
I couldn't help it.
You did pray loudly.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.429
So you know who I am?

16:52.638 --> 16:54.473
Yes, you're Guenevere.

16:54.682 --> 16:58.936
So that accounts for your polite,
respectful, despicable behavior?

16:59.103 --> 17:00.312
Oh.

17:00.479 --> 17:02.981
Why isn't Merlyn here?

17:03.190 --> 17:05.483
- Who?
- Merlyn. He's my teacher.

17:05.983 --> 17:09.988
He's the wisest man alive. He'd know
what to do. He lives backwards.

17:10.781 --> 17:14.451
- Beg your pardon?
- He lives backwards.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.496
He doesn't age.
He...

17:17.704 --> 17:18.914
...youthens?

17:21.500 --> 17:24.169
He can remember the future...

17:24.377 --> 17:26.672
...so he can tell you
what you'll do in it.

17:31.301 --> 17:32.386
Come here.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.139
Please.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.518
Close your eyes.

17:41.687 --> 17:42.813
Please.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.316
Now just turn, gently.

17:47.484 --> 17:48.527
Now....

17:48.694 --> 17:51.196
Very slowly, open them.

17:53.866 --> 17:56.410
Do you see that castle?

17:58.412 --> 17:59.455
Yeah.

17:59.621 --> 18:03.375
It used to light up
in a sort of pink glow.

18:05.836 --> 18:08.714
When I was young,
everything looked a little pink to me.

18:10.215 --> 18:12.134
But then, one....

18:13.177 --> 18:16.096
When Merlyn left,
he took all the pink with him.

18:19.224 --> 18:21.268
Don't stare. It's rude.

18:22.561 --> 18:23.979
Who are you?

18:26.732 --> 18:27.775
Well....

18:27.941 --> 18:30.527
Actually, they call me Wart, actually.

18:32.738 --> 18:37.034
- You sure you heard them properly?
- It's a nickname. Merlyn gave it to me.

18:40.871 --> 18:42.247
Wart, what--?

18:42.414 --> 18:44.041
- Is it really Wart?
- Mm-hm.

18:45.876 --> 18:47.085
Wart.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.713
Why don't you run away with me?

18:50.005 --> 18:51.048
I?

18:51.215 --> 18:54.593
You could be my protector,
defend me all over the world...

18:54.927 --> 18:56.887
...in France, in England,
Mongolia, Scotland.

18:57.054 --> 18:59.556
Oh, what a wonderful dream you spin.

18:59.723 --> 19:02.726
And how easy it would be for me
to be caught up in it.

19:03.268 --> 19:04.436
But...

19:05.229 --> 19:06.730
...I must decline.

19:07.231 --> 19:08.690
You forcing me to stay?

19:08.982 --> 19:10.275
Oh, no, my lady!

19:10.484 --> 19:14.321
If you persist in escaping, I'll find
somebody brave to accompany you.

19:14.947 --> 19:17.658
Then do so at once before
your wretched king finds me.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.786
Oh, do look around you, my lady!

19:21.620 --> 19:22.996
Reconsider.

19:23.789 --> 19:26.124
Camelot is unique.

19:26.750 --> 19:31.296
And we have, by far and away,
the most equable climate in all England.

19:32.631 --> 19:34.675
Ordained by decree.

19:37.719 --> 19:39.179
Oh, come now!

19:41.807 --> 19:43.100
It's true.

19:44.059 --> 19:46.019
Heh, it's true!

19:46.812 --> 19:49.439
<i>The Crown has made it clear</i>

19:49.648 --> 19:52.359
<i>The climate must be perfect</i>

19:52.568 --> 19:54.778
<i>All the year</i>

19:55.487 --> 19:59.324
<i>A law was made
A distant moon ago here</i>

20:00.158 --> 20:03.495
<i>July and August cannot be too hot</i>

20:04.830 --> 20:08.500
<i>And there's a legal limit
To the snow here</i>

20:09.501 --> 20:11.003
<i>In Camelot</i>

20:14.339 --> 20:17.801
<i>The winter is forbidden till December</i>

20:18.677 --> 20:22.806
<i>And exits March the second on the dot</i>

20:23.181 --> 20:27.185
<i>By order, summer lingers
Through September</i>

20:28.020 --> 20:29.187
<i>In Camelot</i>

20:32.816 --> 20:33.984
<i>Camelot</i>

20:34.943 --> 20:36.028
<i>Camelot</i>

20:37.195 --> 20:39.573
<i>I know it sounds a bit bizarre</i>

20:41.366 --> 20:43.201
<i>But in Camelot</i>

20:44.620 --> 20:45.954
<i>Camelot</i>

20:46.538 --> 20:49.333
<i>That's how conditions are</i>

20:51.209 --> 20:55.213
<i>The rain may never fall
Till after sundown</i>

20:56.048 --> 20:59.384
<i>By 8 the morning fog must disappear</i>

21:00.552 --> 21:05.223
<i>In short, there's simply not
A more congenial spot</i>

21:05.724 --> 21:08.894
<i>For happily-ever-aftering</i>

21:09.227 --> 21:14.900
<i>Than here in Camelot</i>

21:17.402 --> 21:20.864
And I suppose the autumn leaves
fall into neat little piles?

21:21.740 --> 21:25.535
Oh, no, my lady.
They, pfft, blow away completely.

21:26.244 --> 21:28.413
At night, of course.

21:33.460 --> 21:35.379
Of course.

21:36.838 --> 21:38.215
<i>Camelot</i>

21:39.049 --> 21:40.092
<i>Camelot</i>

21:40.258 --> 21:42.928
<i>I know it gives a person pause</i>

21:45.263 --> 21:47.057
<i>But in Camelot</i>

21:48.225 --> 21:49.601
<i>Camelot</i>

21:50.102 --> 21:52.437
<i>Those are the legal laws</i>

21:55.607 --> 21:59.111
<i>The snow may never
Slush upon the hillside</i>

22:00.779 --> 22:04.616
<i>By 9 p.m.
The moonlight must appear</i>

22:06.284 --> 22:08.620
<i>In short, there's simply not</i>

22:09.538 --> 22:11.623
<i>A more congenial spot</i>

22:12.457 --> 22:16.461
<i>For happily-ever-aftering</i>

22:17.963 --> 22:20.465
<i>Than here</i>

22:20.799 --> 22:23.635
<i>In Camelot</i>

22:28.390 --> 22:31.059
Look! There, on the hill!

22:31.727 --> 22:32.811
What?

22:35.564 --> 22:37.274
I'm truly sorry, but...

22:37.441 --> 22:41.028
...I'm-- I'm afraid, on account of me...

22:41.236 --> 22:43.113
- ...you may be hanged!
- Hanged?

22:43.280 --> 22:45.115
Or burnt at the stake for abducting me!

22:45.282 --> 22:48.535
That uncivilized king of yours will....
Defend yourself!

22:50.954 --> 22:54.041
There she is!
But who's that peasant with her?

22:55.125 --> 22:57.085
You rogue.

22:58.545 --> 22:59.963
The king!

23:00.839 --> 23:02.924
- The king!
- His Majesty.

23:03.091 --> 23:06.261
It's the king!

23:06.428 --> 23:08.138
It's the king! Wart, it's the king!

23:08.346 --> 23:10.223
Your Majesty, forgive.... Forgive me.

23:10.557 --> 23:12.309
I did not know it was you.

23:21.651 --> 23:22.986
The king.

23:49.554 --> 23:52.182
When I was a young lad
of 18 years of age...

23:52.390 --> 23:57.145
...our good king, Pendragon, died,
leaving no one to succeed him...

23:57.395 --> 24:01.191
...but a sword stuck through an anvil
that stood on a stone.

24:01.399 --> 24:03.527
Written on it,
in gold letters, it said:

24:03.735 --> 24:06.404
"Who so pulleth this sword
from this stone...

24:06.613 --> 24:08.990
...is rightwise born
King of all England."

24:09.574 --> 24:13.203
Well, many chaps tried to
dislodge it, but they failed.

24:13.411 --> 24:17.415
So finally, a great tournament was
proclaimed for New Year's Day.

24:18.083 --> 24:21.711
All the mightiest knights in England
were assembled at one time to have...

24:21.878 --> 24:23.588
...a go at the sword.

24:27.259 --> 24:28.718
Well....

24:29.553 --> 24:34.099
I-- I-- I went to London as squire
to my cousin, Sir Kay.

24:34.432 --> 24:37.894
On tournament day, Sir Kay found
he had left his sword at home...

24:38.103 --> 24:40.564
...and he gave me
a shilling to fetch it.

24:40.772 --> 24:44.401
Going through London,
I passed a square and saw a sword...

24:44.943 --> 24:47.070
...rising out of a stone.

24:47.279 --> 24:49.072
Not thinking very clearly, I...

24:50.323 --> 24:53.076
...I thought it was a war memorial.

24:57.122 --> 24:59.457
So I decided to borrow it...

24:59.666 --> 25:02.210
...and to save myself the trip.

25:02.627 --> 25:03.920
So I...

25:04.921 --> 25:06.590
...took the sword....

25:07.632 --> 25:09.551
Took the sword and...

25:09.968 --> 25:11.303
...I failed.

25:11.553 --> 25:13.263
So I tried again.

25:14.639 --> 25:16.641
And I failed again.

25:18.810 --> 25:22.314
So, with all my might,
I closed my eyes...

25:23.148 --> 25:24.649
...and I tried...

25:24.858 --> 25:28.445
...one last time.

25:29.654 --> 25:31.031
And, lo!

25:31.239 --> 25:33.491
The sword moved in my hand.

25:36.161 --> 25:37.704
And slowly...

25:38.538 --> 25:42.000
...it slid out of the stone.

25:44.336 --> 25:46.004
I heard...

25:46.213 --> 25:47.464
...a great roar.

25:47.672 --> 25:50.967
I opened my eyes.
The square was full of people saying:

25:51.134 --> 25:53.845
"Long live the king!
Long live...

25:56.723 --> 25:58.016
...the king."

26:04.522 --> 26:06.358
That's how I became king.

26:06.566 --> 26:09.444
I never knew I would be.
I never wanted to be.

26:09.694 --> 26:13.156
And since I am,
I've been ill at ease in my crown.

26:13.531 --> 26:16.534
Until I dropped from the tree...

26:18.203 --> 26:20.121
...and my eyes...

26:20.330 --> 26:22.040
...beheld you.

26:25.710 --> 26:29.965
And then, for the first time...

26:30.173 --> 26:33.718
...I felt like a king.
I was glad to be king.

26:34.719 --> 26:39.307
And most astonishing of all,
I wanted to be the most heroic...

26:39.724 --> 26:42.185
...the wisest, the most...

26:42.602 --> 26:45.063
...splendid king ever to sit...

26:45.272 --> 26:47.357
...on any throne.

27:01.037 --> 27:02.622
Well, if you'll....

27:03.415 --> 27:05.875
If my lady will follow me, I'll...

27:06.042 --> 27:08.712
...I'll find a proper companion...

27:10.505 --> 27:12.382
...to accompany you.

27:35.280 --> 27:38.283
<i>I hear it never rains</i>

27:38.950 --> 27:41.411
<i>Till after sundown</i>

27:43.955 --> 27:49.919
<i>By 8 the morning fog
Must disappear</i>

27:50.962 --> 27:53.631
<i>In short, there's simply not</i>

27:54.632 --> 27:56.968
<i>A more congenial spot</i>

27:57.635 --> 28:01.306
<i>For happily-ever-aftering</i>

28:05.143 --> 28:09.147
<i>Than here</i>

28:09.314 --> 28:16.237
<i>In Camelot</i>

28:33.171 --> 28:38.134
<i>A law was made a distant moon ago here</i>

28:39.386 --> 28:43.223
<i>July and August cannot be too hot</i>

28:45.100 --> 28:50.688
<i>And there's a legal limit
To the snow here</i>

28:51.064 --> 28:52.982

28:54.150 --> 28:56.236

29:46.536 --> 29:53.460
<i>In Camelot</i>

29:57.797 --> 30:00.049
<i>The map of England.</i>

30:00.216 --> 30:01.718
Map, indeed.

30:01.885 --> 30:05.221
A fishnet of ill-begotten kingdoms
ruled by immoral lords...

30:05.555 --> 30:10.393
...battling with their own unlawful
armies over illegal border lines.

30:10.727 --> 30:12.187
And who is...

30:12.395 --> 30:14.230
...king of this...

30:14.439 --> 30:15.773
...jungle?

30:15.940 --> 30:17.066
Hmm?

30:17.233 --> 30:19.903
The man who four years ago
pledged he would become...

30:20.069 --> 30:22.572
...the greatest king
who ever sat on any throne.

30:22.739 --> 30:23.823
I...

30:24.407 --> 30:26.242
...Arthur of England.

30:26.951 --> 30:28.036
Yes.

30:28.244 --> 30:31.414
The greatest warrior in the land.

30:31.748 --> 30:33.833
For what purpose?

30:35.043 --> 30:36.085
Might...

30:36.252 --> 30:39.130
...doesn't always mean right.

30:39.797 --> 30:43.676
What are you saying? To be right
and lose couldn't possibly be right.

30:44.052 --> 30:45.220
Merlyn...

30:46.054 --> 30:48.348
...used to frown on battles.

30:48.556 --> 30:50.475
Yet he always...

30:50.683 --> 30:52.018
...helped me win them.

30:52.227 --> 30:53.269
Why?

30:59.317 --> 31:00.527
Proposition:

31:01.986 --> 31:05.657
Is it far better to be alive than dead?

31:05.949 --> 31:07.283
Yes, far better. Mm.

31:07.784 --> 31:09.452
If that is so...

31:10.161 --> 31:13.081
...then why do we have wars...

31:13.289 --> 31:16.042
...in which people can get killed?

31:16.251 --> 31:17.961
I don't know, do you?

31:18.169 --> 31:19.420
Yes.

31:19.796 --> 31:22.674
Because somebody attacks.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.509
Why do they attack?

31:31.808 --> 31:33.309
Jenny.

31:34.644 --> 31:36.312
Did I ever tell you...

31:36.521 --> 31:39.816
...how Merlyn taught me how to think?

31:40.233 --> 31:41.276
No.

31:41.484 --> 31:44.862
By changing me into animals.

31:45.363 --> 31:47.532
Oh, really! Arthur!

31:51.703 --> 31:54.539
Jenny, I mean by making me believe...

31:55.540 --> 31:57.875
...he had changed me into animals.

31:58.626 --> 32:02.338
For instance, when a hawk
is up there looking down at the world...

32:02.547 --> 32:05.633
...there are no boundaries.

32:06.551 --> 32:07.885
Right?

32:08.511 --> 32:09.804
Hmm.

32:11.306 --> 32:12.515
Yet boundaries are what...

32:12.682 --> 32:14.267
...somebody always attacks about.

32:14.475 --> 32:18.521
And you win by pushing them
back across something that...

32:19.272 --> 32:21.232
...that doesn't exist.

32:21.441 --> 32:25.445
So we have battles for no reason at all.
Why, Jenny, why?

32:25.653 --> 32:28.573
Because ladies love knights.
To see your knight in armor....

32:28.781 --> 32:30.241
That's it, Jenny.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.660
Jenny, that is it!

32:32.869 --> 32:34.120
It's the armor!

32:34.329 --> 32:36.998
It's the armor, Jenny.
The armor.

32:38.207 --> 32:42.378
Look, only the knights are rich enough
to have armor. The foot soldiers....

32:42.545 --> 32:43.921
Well, they have nothing.

32:44.505 --> 32:47.383
So, all that can happen
to a knight is, uh...

32:47.550 --> 32:51.054
...an occasional, unh, dent.

32:51.804 --> 32:53.056
<i>Proposition:</i>

32:53.348 --> 32:55.350
<i>Right or wrong...</i>

32:55.558 --> 32:59.062
<i>...they have the might.
So right or wrong, they're always right.</i>

32:59.228 --> 33:01.522
<i>That's wrong.
Right?</i>

33:02.273 --> 33:03.900
Jenny.

33:05.443 --> 33:07.278
Jenny.

33:10.365 --> 33:12.241
Jenny.

33:15.578 --> 33:17.080
- Jenny.
- I'm here.

33:19.749 --> 33:21.376
Jenny, Jenny.

33:21.542 --> 33:24.337
Suppose we create
a new order of chivalry?

33:25.630 --> 33:28.925
A new order where
might is only used for right.

33:29.425 --> 33:32.595
To improve instead of to destroy.
Look, we'll invite all knights...

33:32.804 --> 33:36.557
...and kings of all kingdoms to lay down
their arms to come and join us.

33:36.891 --> 33:38.059
Oh, yes, Jenny.

33:38.518 --> 33:39.769
And we'll...

33:40.311 --> 33:43.064
...take one of the large rooms
in the castle...

33:43.272 --> 33:46.359
...put a table in it
and all the knights will gather at it.

33:46.693 --> 33:47.860
And do what?

33:48.986 --> 33:50.488
Talk across it.

33:51.447 --> 33:52.740
Debate.

33:53.116 --> 33:55.284
Make laws.
Plan improvements.

33:56.244 --> 34:00.123
But, Arthur, do you think
all the knights will ever want to...

34:00.415 --> 34:03.334
...to do such a ridiculously
peaceful thing?

34:03.918 --> 34:06.713
We'll make it a great honor.

34:07.296 --> 34:09.966
Very fashionable.
Everyone will want to join.

34:10.425 --> 34:11.634
Only now...

34:13.052 --> 34:15.554
...the knights will whack only for good.

34:15.763 --> 34:17.098
Might for right.

34:21.101 --> 34:22.937
Might for right.

34:26.315 --> 34:27.400
Might...

34:27.608 --> 34:29.402
...for right!

34:30.277 --> 34:31.320
That's it, Jenny!

34:33.781 --> 34:35.116
Might....

34:36.617 --> 34:39.161
No, not might is right!

34:40.455 --> 34:41.998
Might...

34:42.623 --> 34:43.791
...for...

34:44.876 --> 34:45.918
...right!

34:47.628 --> 34:49.213
It's very original. Heh.

34:49.380 --> 34:50.965
Yes. Yes, yes. And--

34:51.132 --> 34:52.382
And civilized, Jenny.

34:52.592 --> 34:54.927
It will have to be
an awfully large table.

34:55.136 --> 34:59.599
What of jealousy? All will claim
superiority and want to sit at the head.

35:00.308 --> 35:01.684
We'll make it...

35:02.101 --> 35:04.103
...a round table.

35:04.312 --> 35:06.230
So there is no head.

35:06.647 --> 35:09.108
A round table!

35:09.734 --> 35:15.698
Round...

35:18.075 --> 35:20.495
...table.

35:20.661 --> 35:24.832
My father's got one
that would be perfect. It seats 150.

35:25.041 --> 35:28.377
He had it as a wedding present
and he never used it.

35:29.504 --> 35:31.631
<i>We'll send the heralds</i>

35:31.798 --> 35:33.841
<i>Riding through the country</i>

35:35.343 --> 35:39.514
<i>Tell every living person far and near</i>

35:41.015 --> 35:43.184
<i>That there is simply not</i>

35:43.518 --> 35:46.187
<i>In all the world a spot</i>

35:46.854 --> 35:51.526
<i>Where rules a more resplendent king</i>

35:53.194 --> 35:55.112
<i>Than here</i>

38:24.971 --> 38:28.641
<i>And all that and more I shall be</i>

38:29.976 --> 38:33.980
<i>A knight of the table round
Should be invincible</i>

38:34.939 --> 38:38.359
<i>Succeed where a less fantastic man
Would fail</i>

38:39.151 --> 38:43.489
<i>Climb a wall no one else can climb
Cleave a dragon in record time</i>

38:43.823 --> 38:47.827
<i>Swim a moat
In a coat of heavy iron mail</i>

38:48.995 --> 38:52.999
<i>No matter the pain
He ought to be unwinceable</i>

38:53.833 --> 38:57.837
<i>Impossible deeds
Should be his daily fare</i>

38:58.504 --> 39:00.673
<i>But where in the world</i>

39:01.007 --> 39:03.676
<i>Is there in the world</i>

39:04.010 --> 39:11.559
<i>A man so extraordinaire?</i>

39:14.186 --> 39:17.690
C'est moi, c'est moi
<i>I'm forced to admit</i>

39:18.024 --> 39:21.360
<i>'Tis I I humbly reply</i>

39:21.569 --> 39:24.864
<i>That mortal who these marvels can do</i>

39:25.197 --> 39:28.325
C'est moi, c'est moi <i>'Tis I</i>

39:28.951 --> 39:32.580
<i>I've never lost
In battle or game</i>

39:32.788 --> 39:36.000
<i>I'm simply the best by far</i>

39:36.375 --> 39:40.129
<i>When swords are crossed
'Tis always the same</i>

39:40.463 --> 39:43.799
<i>One blow and</i> Au revoir

39:44.216 --> 39:47.970
C'est moi, c'est moi
<i>So admirably fit</i>

39:48.220 --> 39:51.974
<i>A French Prometheus Unbound</i>

39:52.308 --> 39:56.312
<i>And here am I With valor untold</i>

39:56.979 --> 39:59.648
<i>Exceptionally brave</i>

39:59.982 --> 40:03.152
<i>Amazingly bold</i>

40:03.611 --> 40:06.989
<i>To serve at the table round</i>

40:07.782 --> 40:11.452
<i>The soul of a knight
Should be a thing remarkable</i>

40:12.161 --> 40:15.664
<i>His heart and his mind
As pure as morning dew</i>

40:16.457 --> 40:20.795
<i>With a will and a self-restraint
That's the envy of every saint</i>

40:21.128 --> 40:24.632
<i>He could easily work a miracle or two</i>

40:26.342 --> 40:30.221
<i>To love and desire
He ought to be unsparkable</i>

40:30.971 --> 40:35.142
<i>The ways of the flesh
Should offer no allure</i>

40:35.476 --> 40:40.147
<i>But where in the world
Is there in the world</i>

40:40.648 --> 40:43.484
<i>A man so untouched</i>

40:43.818 --> 40:49.907
<i>And pure?</i>

40:50.825 --> 40:51.867
C'est moi

40:52.701 --> 40:56.163
C'est moi, c'est moi
<i>I blush to disclose</i>

40:56.497 --> 41:00.000
<i>I'm far too noble to lie</i>

41:00.334 --> 41:04.255
<i>That man in whom
These qualities bloom</i>

41:04.463 --> 41:08.008
C'est moi, C'est moi <i>'Tis I</i>

41:08.425 --> 41:12.304
<i>I've never strayed
From all I believe</i>

41:12.513 --> 41:15.850
<i>I'm blessed with an iron will</i>

41:16.183 --> 41:20.062
<i>Had I been made
The partner of Eve</i>

41:20.229 --> 41:23.691
<i>We'd be in Eden still</i>

41:24.275 --> 41:28.195
C'est moi, c'est moi
<i>The angels have chosen</i>

41:28.404 --> 41:32.032
<i>To fight their battles below</i>

41:32.575 --> 41:37.371
<i>And here am I
As pure as a prayer</i>

41:38.205 --> 41:40.666
<i>Incredibly clean</i>

41:41.417 --> 41:44.086
<i>With virtue to spare</i>

41:44.753 --> 41:48.757
<i>The godliest man I know</i>
C'est moi!

42:18.829 --> 42:20.873
Oh, King Arthur!

42:21.081 --> 42:23.834
What caliber of man you must be...

42:24.335 --> 42:27.421
...to have envisioned
a new order of life.

42:28.130 --> 42:30.758
I worship you before knowing you.

42:56.575 --> 42:58.244
Don't run away, coward!

42:58.869 --> 43:00.663
Come back and fight!

43:32.528 --> 43:33.696
The swine!

43:33.904 --> 43:36.156
- Are you hurt, Your Majesty?
- Fine.

43:41.412 --> 43:42.705
Please!

43:46.709 --> 43:48.585
The next time you traffic with me...

43:48.836 --> 43:52.798
...remember, you challenge
the right arm of King Arthur.

43:53.882 --> 43:55.175
Really?

43:57.636 --> 43:59.430
I am King Arthur.

44:04.893 --> 44:06.395
What?

44:08.314 --> 44:09.523
You...

44:11.317 --> 44:12.860
...are the king!

44:13.068 --> 44:16.280
Yes, almost the late king.

44:17.239 --> 44:19.742
And I struck you?

44:25.247 --> 44:26.665
Your Majesty!

44:27.916 --> 44:28.959
Your Majesty.

44:29.126 --> 44:30.627
I'm Lancelot Du Lac.

44:30.836 --> 44:34.089
In France I heard of your new order
and came to join.

44:34.423 --> 44:36.467
I beg Your Majesty to forgive me.

44:37.426 --> 44:39.094
Not because I deserve it...

44:39.261 --> 44:41.680
...but because by forgiving me...

44:41.889 --> 44:43.182
...I'll suffer more.

44:43.474 --> 44:45.100
But, really, dear chap...

44:45.309 --> 44:47.895
...I don't want you to suffer at all.

44:48.062 --> 44:52.024
I want to congratulate you.
Please rise. You, too, squire.

44:52.191 --> 44:53.984
Uh, I can't, <i>Mon roi.</i>

44:54.193 --> 44:58.072
- I'm too ashamed to lift my head.
- Well, then I command you.

44:58.614 --> 45:01.325
I have never felt
a bash in my chest quite like it.

45:01.533 --> 45:04.286
It was most spectacular.
Where did you learn to do it?

45:05.287 --> 45:08.040
My skill comes from training, <i>Mon roi.</i>

45:08.916 --> 45:11.168
My strength from purity.

45:13.545 --> 45:16.382
Well, that's a unique recipe.

45:16.673 --> 45:19.176
He's a unique man, Your Majesty.

45:19.385 --> 45:23.305
At the age of fourteen
he could defeat any jouster in France.

45:23.722 --> 45:26.475
His father, King Ban,
made me his squire.

45:26.683 --> 45:28.227
- King Ban?
- Yes.

45:29.144 --> 45:30.646
In France?

45:31.814 --> 45:33.482
What did you say your name was?

45:33.732 --> 45:36.318
Lancelot Du Lac, Your Majesty.

45:37.986 --> 45:41.824
You're Lancelot?
I was told you were coming.

45:42.741 --> 45:45.160
You were told?

45:46.078 --> 45:47.496
Yes.

45:47.663 --> 45:50.374
By Merlyn, the court magician.

45:50.582 --> 45:51.959
He said to me one day:

45:52.126 --> 45:57.381
"Arthur, keep your eye out for a
Frenchman called Lancelot Du Lac.

45:57.589 --> 46:01.051
He will come to the court of Camelot
and he will be...."

46:02.594 --> 46:04.179
What was it now?

46:04.513 --> 46:05.639
"He will be...."

46:06.348 --> 46:09.059
Your ally, if you'll take me.

46:09.268 --> 46:11.728
Your friend, who asks no friendship.

46:11.937 --> 46:14.189
Your defender when you need one...

46:14.398 --> 46:16.900
...whose body is your sword to brandish.

46:17.609 --> 46:19.611
Did he prophesy that, Your Majesty?

46:19.820 --> 46:22.364
For all that, I am.

46:23.115 --> 46:24.741
Really, my dear fellow...

46:24.950 --> 46:27.703
...this is far more
than I could wish for...

46:28.370 --> 46:30.539
...uh, or even ask.

46:31.415 --> 46:33.250
Then you will accept me?

46:33.459 --> 46:35.586
Without hesitation.

46:35.836 --> 46:38.714
- We will arrange for your knighthood.
- Oh, thank you!

46:43.469 --> 46:46.388
We must arrange for
your knighthood immediately.

46:46.597 --> 46:49.641
Oh, no. No, Your Majesty.
All you know of me is words.

46:49.850 --> 46:52.561
Invest me because of deeds, sire.
Give me an order.

46:52.769 --> 46:54.062
- Now?
- This moment.

46:54.271 --> 46:57.399
Send me on a mission.
Is there some wrong I can right?

46:57.608 --> 47:00.819
Some enemy I can battle?
Some peril I can undertake?

47:01.653 --> 47:04.907
Well, actually,
there's not much going on today.

47:05.491 --> 47:09.369
Uh, it's the first of May. The Queen and
some of the court have gone a-Maying.

47:09.953 --> 47:12.164
Gone a-Maying?

47:12.581 --> 47:14.875
Yes, it's a sort of...

47:16.502 --> 47:17.961
...picnic?

47:18.337 --> 47:21.423
They eat berries
and chase young girls around--

47:21.590 --> 47:23.258
Picnic?

47:23.425 --> 47:26.261
It's a custom we have here.

47:26.470 --> 47:28.931
This is England, you know.

47:29.097 --> 47:31.767
And this is the season
for gathering flowers.

47:32.100 --> 47:34.269
Knights gathering flowers?

47:34.436 --> 47:36.772
Well, someone has to do it!

47:38.482 --> 47:40.776
And besides, it's....

47:41.610 --> 47:43.779
It's civilized.

47:44.029 --> 47:46.865
And civilization should have...

47:47.074 --> 47:50.077
...a few gentle hobbies.

47:52.246 --> 47:53.288
Come, come.

47:54.706 --> 47:56.959
I want you to meet the queen.

47:59.419 --> 48:02.339
Dap, take the horses and feed them.

48:12.641 --> 48:15.686
By George, Lancelot!

48:15.852 --> 48:18.480
I suddenly remembered
what Merlyn said of you.

48:18.939 --> 48:20.607
How strange!

48:21.149 --> 48:25.279
He said that you would be the
greatest knight ever to sit at my table.

48:25.779 --> 48:28.031
That was long before
I thought of a table.

48:28.240 --> 48:30.826
So he knew it would exist.

48:31.368 --> 48:35.330
I.... I.... Oh, dear!
I thought he meant a dining table.

48:35.497 --> 48:37.124
But he meant this.

48:37.332 --> 48:38.792
The Round Table!

48:39.001 --> 48:42.004
And I have stumbled on my future.

48:42.170 --> 48:43.589
I've done...

48:43.797 --> 48:45.465
...the right thing.

48:45.841 --> 48:48.427
Did you ever doubt it, Your Majesty?

48:48.677 --> 48:51.013
Oh, of course, of course.

48:51.179 --> 48:52.681
Only fools...

48:52.889 --> 48:54.433
...never doubt.

48:55.434 --> 48:57.686
Oh, welcome, Lancelot.

48:59.605 --> 49:00.814
Bless you for coming.

49:01.023 --> 49:03.191
Welcome to my table.

49:44.900 --> 49:48.612
<i>It's May</i>

49:48.779 --> 49:51.239
<i>It's May</i>

49:52.324 --> 49:58.038
<i>The lusty month of May</i>

49:58.497 --> 50:00.957
<i>That lovely month</i>

50:01.583 --> 50:03.877
<i>When everyone goes</i>

50:05.253 --> 50:08.882
<i>Blissfully astray</i>

50:10.092 --> 50:12.761
<i>It's here, it's here</i>

50:13.095 --> 50:15.389
<i>That shocking time of year</i>

50:15.597 --> 50:18.767
<i>When tons of wicked little thoughts</i>

50:18.975 --> 50:20.769
<i>Merrily appear</i>

50:21.103 --> 50:22.145
<i>It's May!</i>

50:22.521 --> 50:23.730
<i>Oh, it's May</i>

50:23.897 --> 50:26.108
<i>That gorgeous holiday</i>

50:26.608 --> 50:31.113
<i>When every maiden itches for fun</i>

50:31.446 --> 50:33.949
<i>Wholesome or "un"</i>

50:34.282 --> 50:35.742
<i>It's mad!</i>

50:35.909 --> 50:36.952
<i>Oh, it's gay</i>

50:37.119 --> 50:39.788
<i>Depraved in every way</i>

50:40.122 --> 50:44.626
<i>Those dreary vows that everyone takes
Everyone breaks</i>

50:44.960 --> 50:47.587
<i>Everyone makes divine mistakes</i>

50:47.796 --> 50:53.301

<i>It's May</i>

50:54.720 --> 50:55.762
<i>Oh, it's May</i>

50:55.929 --> 50:58.056
<i>The lusty month of May</i>

50:58.432 --> 51:01.393
<i>That darling month
When everyone throws</i>

51:01.601 --> 51:03.520
<i>Self-control away</i>

51:03.937 --> 51:06.148
<i>It's time to do</i>

51:06.815 --> 51:08.984
<i>A wretched thing or two</i>

51:09.484 --> 51:12.279
<i>And try to make each precious day</i>

51:12.487 --> 51:14.948
<i>One you'll always rue</i>

51:15.115 --> 51:16.366
<i>It's May</i>

51:16.533 --> 51:17.868
<i>It's May</i>

51:18.034 --> 51:20.287
<i>The month of "Yes, you may"</i>

51:20.996 --> 51:23.498
<i>A time for every</i>

51:23.707 --> 51:25.000
<i>Frivolous whim</i>

51:25.459 --> 51:28.128
<i>Proper or "im"</i>

51:28.462 --> 51:29.546
<i>It's wild!</i>

51:29.963 --> 51:31.381
<i>It's wild! It's gay!</i>

51:32.299 --> 51:35.177
<i>A libelous display</i>

51:35.802 --> 51:37.471
<i>The birds and bees</i>

51:37.679 --> 51:41.141
<i>Will all of their vast
Amorous past</i>

51:41.349 --> 51:44.644
<i>Gaze at the human race Aghast!</i>

51:44.853 --> 51:46.521
<i>The lusty</i>

51:46.730 --> 51:50.901
<i>Month of May!</i>

51:56.323 --> 51:57.699

51:57.866 --> 51:59.701
<i>The lusty month of May</i>

52:13.381 --> 52:15.217
<i>The month of great dismay</i>

52:15.383 --> 52:18.553
<i>When all the world is brimming with fun</i>

<i>Wholesome or "un"</i>

52:38.240 --> 52:40.492
<i>The month of "Yes, you may"</i>

<i>It's May, it's May</i>

53:04.808 --> 53:07.310
<i>It's May</i>

53:10.772 --> 53:12.107
Now then...

53:12.315 --> 53:14.276
...which way to go?

53:14.442 --> 53:15.610
North.

53:16.027 --> 53:17.112
Uh.

53:17.279 --> 53:18.822
No, no, that's north.

53:19.447 --> 53:20.448
No.

53:20.615 --> 53:22.200
No, that's north.

53:22.576 --> 53:24.244
That's, uh....

53:25.745 --> 53:27.539
I'm completely lost.

53:28.456 --> 53:30.625
Who's that rusty old fellow?

53:31.042 --> 53:33.962
I've never seen him before,
Your Majesty.

53:34.754 --> 53:36.548
Offer him assistance.

53:40.594 --> 53:42.721
That mountain seems familiar.

53:42.888 --> 53:45.098
Uh, let's see.

53:45.765 --> 53:47.100
Good day, milord.

53:48.268 --> 53:51.730
How do you do, young man?
The name of King Pellinore here.

53:51.980 --> 53:54.482
- You are a king, sire?
- Yes.

53:56.484 --> 53:58.361
Of what country?

53:59.446 --> 54:03.033
I don't know.
I.... I lost my kingdom.

54:03.909 --> 54:05.035
To whom?

54:05.243 --> 54:08.455
Well, I mislaid it.
I left it somewhere and I....

54:09.581 --> 54:11.750
- I can't find my way back.
- What?

54:12.334 --> 54:15.170
- Why, I believe him.
- Your Majesty!

54:16.922 --> 54:18.256
Your.... Your Majesty?

54:18.465 --> 54:22.344
Yes, milord. You are addressing
Her Majesty, the Queen of England.

54:22.761 --> 54:25.847
The queen?
Why, why! How do you do?

54:27.223 --> 54:29.851
Forgive me, ma'am.
The beastly hinges need oiling.

54:30.143 --> 54:32.854
Be at ease, my lord.
Welcome to Camelot.

54:33.688 --> 54:35.190
Camelot?

54:36.024 --> 54:37.067
Camelot....

54:37.233 --> 54:38.944
Haven't I been here before?

54:39.152 --> 54:43.782
Yes, years ago. I spent a jolly
fortnight with a fine little fellow...

54:43.990 --> 54:46.785
...called Wart.
Ever met him, ma'am?

54:47.202 --> 54:48.870
Constantly.
He's my husband.

54:49.037 --> 54:50.580
Oh.

54:51.206 --> 54:52.874
King Arthur of England.

54:53.083 --> 54:55.377
The King? Is he?

54:55.627 --> 54:58.088
Well, well! Is he?
By Jove, good for him!

54:58.296 --> 55:03.593
That's what I call well done.
Imagine. The king! Oh.

55:04.386 --> 55:07.305
And he knows the name
of what he's king of.

55:07.806 --> 55:11.267
Arthur would be pleased to see you.
Would you care to spend the night?

55:12.143 --> 55:15.146
What, in a bed?
In a real bed?

55:15.355 --> 55:16.564
Damnation, I'd like that.

55:16.773 --> 55:20.110
I haven't put spine to feathers
since I left....

55:20.318 --> 55:21.903
Since I left, uh....

55:24.406 --> 55:27.575
Go, one of you.
Escort His Majesty to the castle.

55:27.742 --> 55:30.161
Oh, I'm very grateful to you, ma'am.

55:30.370 --> 55:31.579
Oh, thank you, very much.

55:41.339 --> 55:42.924
Jenny!

55:43.133 --> 55:44.300
Jenny!

55:45.427 --> 55:47.262
Arthur.

55:48.680 --> 55:50.140
- Jenny, Jenny.
- Ha, ha.

55:50.306 --> 55:52.684
I want to present to you
Lancelot Du Lac.

55:52.892 --> 55:54.978
He's come all the way from France
to join our Table.

55:55.145 --> 55:56.855
<i>- Monsieur.</i>
- Your Majesty.

55:57.439 --> 56:01.359
This is the Lancelot
that Merlyn used to speak of.

56:01.526 --> 56:02.819
You're most welcome.

56:03.653 --> 56:05.613
I'm honored to be among you, milady.

56:05.905 --> 56:10.452
And allow me to pledge my eternal
dedication to this noble cause.

56:10.618 --> 56:13.455
Thank you, <i>monsieur.</i>
Arthur, I met this strange man--

56:13.621 --> 56:16.916
This splendid dream
must become a universal reality.

56:17.125 --> 56:18.168
What?

56:18.877 --> 56:20.837
Oh, absolutely. It really must.

56:21.171 --> 56:23.673
I have assured the king
he may call upon me...

56:23.882 --> 56:27.135
...at any time to perform any deed,
no matter the danger.

56:27.343 --> 56:29.512
Thank you, <i>monsieur.</i>
That's most comforting.

56:30.013 --> 56:31.931
I'm always on duty.

56:32.265 --> 56:33.600
Yes, I can see that.

56:33.808 --> 56:35.602
I would love to come to lunch...

56:35.810 --> 56:38.813
...but I want you to listen to the plans
we have been discussing.

56:38.980 --> 56:41.399
Now, Lancelot, uh, explain it.

56:41.900 --> 56:45.820
- Uh, to the queen, sire?
- Yes, yes, of course.

56:46.029 --> 56:48.531
Would not Madame find it tedious?

56:49.657 --> 56:52.327
I have never found chivalry tedious.

56:53.036 --> 56:54.496
So far.

56:55.038 --> 56:56.498
May I remind you, <i>monsieur...</i>

56:56.706 --> 57:00.460
...that the Round Table happens to be
the idea of my husband.

57:00.668 --> 57:02.337
My husband's idea.

57:05.423 --> 57:07.842
Any idea, milady...

57:08.009 --> 57:11.096
...however exalted, could be improved.

57:11.513 --> 57:13.973
- Oh, really?
- Of course.

57:14.182 --> 57:17.185
I've suggested that we create
a training program for knights.

57:17.393 --> 57:20.021
- Isn't that a marvelous idea, Jenny?
- A training program?

57:20.188 --> 57:21.356
Mm-hm.

57:21.523 --> 57:22.774
Yes, milady.

57:23.108 --> 57:25.985
The Round Table
must have a standard.

57:26.319 --> 57:29.489
A standard physical
and a standard moral.

57:29.823 --> 57:32.826
And whose abilities would serve
as a standard, <i>monsieur?</i>

57:33.034 --> 57:34.869
Oh, certainly not mine, milady.

57:35.203 --> 57:36.579
It would not be fair.

57:36.788 --> 57:38.456
Not fair? In what way?

57:38.665 --> 57:42.877
I would never ask anyone to live
by my standards, milady.

57:43.128 --> 57:44.796
To devote your life...

57:45.004 --> 57:49.759
...to the tortured quest
for perfection in body and spirit.

57:50.468 --> 57:52.387
Oh, no. I would not ask that of anyone.

57:52.804 --> 57:54.055
No, nor would I.

57:54.264 --> 57:56.891
And have you achieved perfection,
<i>monsieur?</i>

57:58.143 --> 57:59.727
Physically, yes, milady.

58:00.145 --> 58:04.524
But the refining of the soul
is an endless struggle.

58:06.151 --> 58:09.070
I daresay. I do daresay.

58:10.321 --> 58:13.825
Do you mean you've never been
defeated in battle or in a tournament?

58:15.160 --> 58:16.327
No, Your Majesty.

58:18.496 --> 58:19.747
And I gather...

58:19.914 --> 58:23.668
...you consider it unlikely
ever to happen in the future?

58:24.169 --> 58:26.045
Highly, Your Majesty!

58:27.046 --> 58:30.175
How was the channel, Lancelot?
Was it a good crossing?

58:30.341 --> 58:31.467
Uh....

58:31.634 --> 58:35.597
Tell me a little of your struggle
for the perfection of the spirit.

58:36.264 --> 58:39.434
Have you jousted with humility lately?

58:40.602 --> 58:42.228
"Humility," milady?

58:45.023 --> 58:47.650
Or isn't it fashionable
in France this year?

58:48.735 --> 58:52.655
Well, we best discuss the program
elsewhere. You look too beautiful...

58:52.864 --> 58:56.784
...to have anything on your mind
other than frolic and flowers.

58:58.453 --> 59:01.039
Have a lovely day.
Same to all of you.

59:01.247 --> 59:02.832
Come along, Lancelot.

59:03.041 --> 59:04.417
Come quickly.

59:04.626 --> 59:06.252
Good day, my queen.

59:09.214 --> 59:13.635
<i>- Mon dieu</i>, he's unpleasant.
- And so poisonously good.

59:14.093 --> 59:16.221
He probably walked across
the channel.

59:24.229 --> 59:25.813
Sir Dinadan?

59:27.315 --> 59:29.150
Your Majesty.

59:29.317 --> 59:31.569
When is the next tournament?

59:32.070 --> 59:34.364
A week from Saturday, Your Majesty.

59:36.324 --> 59:39.077
And who are the three best jousters
we have?

59:39.994 --> 59:41.829
Sir Lionel, Sir Sagramore...

59:43.331 --> 59:45.959
...and with all <i>humilitÃ©...</i>

59:46.709 --> 59:49.170
...I, Your Majesty.

59:51.381 --> 59:52.840
Really?

01:00:09.649 --> 01:00:10.984
Sir Lionel?

01:00:15.363 --> 01:00:17.031
<i>Do you recall the other night</i>

01:00:17.198 --> 01:00:18.491
<i>That I distinctly said you might</i>

01:00:18.658 --> 01:00:21.369
<i>Serve as my escort
At the next town fair?</i>

01:00:21.703 --> 01:00:25.206
<i>Well, I'm afraid there's someone
Who I must invite in place of you</i>

01:00:25.540 --> 01:00:28.876
<i>Someone who plainly is
Beyond compare</i>

01:00:29.377 --> 01:00:32.714
<i>The Frenchman's power
Is more tremendous</i>

01:00:33.047 --> 01:00:36.384
<i>Than I have ever seen anywhere</i>

01:00:36.718 --> 01:00:40.054
<i>And when a man is that stupendous</i>

01:00:40.388 --> 01:00:43.725
<i>He, by right, should take me
To the fair</i>

01:00:44.726 --> 01:00:45.810
<i>Your Majesty</i>

01:00:45.977 --> 01:00:47.562
<i>Let me tilt with him
And smite him</i>

01:00:48.229 --> 01:00:51.232
<i>Don't refuse me so abruptly
I implore</i>

01:00:52.233 --> 01:00:55.069
<i>Oh, give me the opportunity
To fight him</i>

01:00:55.737 --> 01:01:00.867
<i>And Gaul will be divided
Once more</i>

01:01:02.035 --> 01:01:03.578
You will bash and thrash him?

01:01:04.162 --> 01:01:07.832
I will smash and mash him!

01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:10.251
You'll give him trouble?

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:12.420
He will be rubble.

01:01:12.920 --> 01:01:14.297
A mighty whack?

01:01:14.505 --> 01:01:17.592
His skull will crack!

01:01:19.135 --> 01:01:20.928
<i>Mon dieu.</i>

01:01:21.095 --> 01:01:23.598
<i>Then you may</i>

01:01:23.931 --> 01:01:26.601
<i>Take me to the fair</i>

01:01:26.934 --> 01:01:30.271
<i>If you do all the things
You promise</i>

01:01:30.605 --> 01:01:34.609
<i>In fact, my heart will break
Should you not take me</i>

01:01:34.942 --> 01:01:38.279
<i>To the fair</i>

01:01:39.155 --> 01:01:40.198
Your Majesty.

01:01:40.365 --> 01:01:41.908
Sir Sagramore?

01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:47.580
<i>I have some rather painful news</i>

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:49.290
<i>Relative to the subject who's</i>

01:01:49.499 --> 01:01:52.126
<i>To be beside me at the next court ball</i>

01:01:52.794 --> 01:01:56.464
<i>You were the chosen one, I know
But it's tradition it should go</i>

01:01:56.631 --> 01:01:59.467
<i>To the unquestioned champion
In the hall</i>

01:02:00.134 --> 01:02:03.638
<i>And I'm convinced
That splendid Frenchman</i>

01:02:04.138 --> 01:02:07.975
<i>Can easily conquer one and all</i>

01:02:08.976 --> 01:02:12.814
<i>And besting all our local
Henchmen, he</i>

01:02:13.106 --> 01:02:15.817
<i>Should sit beside me At the ball</i>

01:02:16.651 --> 01:02:17.819
<i>I beg of you, ma'am</i>

01:02:17.985 --> 01:02:19.612
<i>Withhold your invitation</i>

01:02:20.154 --> 01:02:23.658
<i>I swear to you this challenge
Will be met</i>

01:02:24.033 --> 01:02:27.078
<i>And when I have finished up
The operation</i>

01:02:27.662 --> 01:02:31.833
<i>I shall serve him to Your Highness</i>
En brochette

01:02:33.334 --> 01:02:35.503
You'll pierce right through him?

01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:38.464
Ha, ha. I'll barbecue him!

01:02:38.673 --> 01:02:40.341
A wicked thrust?

01:02:40.550 --> 01:02:42.760
It will be dust to dust.

01:02:42.969 --> 01:02:45.179
From fore to aft?

01:02:45.346 --> 01:02:46.597
He'll feel...

01:02:46.806 --> 01:02:48.474
...a draft.

01:02:52.270 --> 01:02:54.856
My goodness!
Well, Sir Sagramore.

01:02:55.022 --> 01:02:56.858
<i>You may sit</i>

01:02:57.066 --> 01:03:00.194
<i>By me at the ball</i>

01:03:00.361 --> 01:03:03.531
<i>If you demolish him In battle</i>

01:03:04.157 --> 01:03:07.869
<i>In fact, I know I'd cry
Were you not by me</i>

01:03:08.202 --> 01:03:10.872
<i>At the ball</i>

01:03:15.042 --> 01:03:16.210
Sir Dinadan?

01:03:24.177 --> 01:03:25.678
<i>Didn't I promise that you may</i>

01:03:25.845 --> 01:03:27.388
<i>Guide me to London on the day</i>

01:03:27.555 --> 01:03:30.057
<i>That I go up to judge
The cattle show</i>

01:03:30.808 --> 01:03:34.228
<i>As it is quite a nasty ride
There must be someone by my side</i>

01:03:34.437 --> 01:03:36.898
<i>Who'll be defending me
From beast and foe</i>

01:03:37.565 --> 01:03:40.902
<i>So when I choose whom I prefer go</i>

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:43.905
<i>I take the strongest knight I know</i>

01:03:44.989 --> 01:03:49.494
<i>And young Du Lac seems strongest
Ergo</i>

01:03:49.827 --> 01:03:51.412
<i>He should</i>

01:03:51.579 --> 01:03:54.540
<i>Take me to the cattle show</i>

01:03:54.916 --> 01:03:56.584
<i>Your Majesty can't believe</i>

01:03:56.751 --> 01:03:57.919
<i>This blustering prattle</i>

01:03:58.669 --> 01:04:01.422
<i>Let him prove it
With a sword or lance instead</i>

01:04:02.381 --> 01:04:05.343
<i>I promise you when I'm done
This gory battle</i>

01:04:06.010 --> 01:04:09.472
<i>His shoulders will be lonesome
For his head</i>

01:04:11.516 --> 01:04:12.808
You'll disconnect him?

01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:15.102
I'll vivisect him!

01:04:15.686 --> 01:04:17.230
You'll open wide him?

01:04:17.480 --> 01:04:19.607
I'll subdivide him!

01:04:22.109 --> 01:04:23.819
<i>Then you may guide me</i>

01:04:23.986 --> 01:04:25.279
<i>To the show</i>

01:04:25.863 --> 01:04:29.116
<i>If you can carry out
Your program</i>

01:04:29.408 --> 01:04:33.454
<i>In fact, I'd grieve inside
Should you not guide me</i>

01:04:33.788 --> 01:04:36.290
<i>To the show</i>

01:04:36.791 --> 01:04:40.127
<i>Milady, we shall put an end to</i>

01:04:40.628 --> 01:04:44.131
<i>That Gallic bag of noise
And nerve</i>

01:04:44.632 --> 01:04:48.302
<i>When we do all that we Intend to</i>

01:04:48.636 --> 01:04:52.306
<i>He'll be a plate of French
Hors d'oeuvres</i>

01:04:52.974 --> 01:04:56.310
<i>I do applaud your noble goals</i>

01:04:57.144 --> 01:05:00.815
<i>Now let us see if you
Achieve them</i>

01:05:01.274 --> 01:05:04.652
<i>And if you do
Then you will be the three</i>

01:05:05.069 --> 01:05:07.989
<i>Who will go to the ball
To the show</i>

01:05:08.322 --> 01:05:09.657
<i>And take me</i>

01:05:10.992 --> 01:05:13.953
<i>To the fair</i>

01:05:14.120 --> 01:05:15.913
<i>- To the fair
- To the fair</i>

01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:18.332
<i>- To the fair
- To the fair</i>

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.793
<i>To the fair</i>

01:05:44.191 --> 01:05:45.276
My lords!

01:05:45.526 --> 01:05:49.196
Have you seen the latest edict?
'Tis the final straw.

01:05:49.572 --> 01:05:52.700
Knights who refuse to lay down
their arms will be attacked...

01:05:52.908 --> 01:05:54.535
...as if they were serfs.

01:05:54.744 --> 01:05:57.747
We're not only to kill foot soldiers,
but knights as well.

01:05:57.955 --> 01:06:00.166
Oh, we know all about it, Dinadan.

01:06:04.879 --> 01:06:06.839
But these other knights...

01:06:09.383 --> 01:06:11.677
...if they fight back...

01:06:12.261 --> 01:06:14.972
- ...we could be killed.
- That's right.

01:06:15.139 --> 01:06:18.100
What's the sense of being born
in the upper class...

01:06:18.309 --> 01:06:21.729
...if you can get killed
like the lower class? Huh?

01:06:21.896 --> 01:06:24.565
It has the stink of French cooking.

01:06:26.692 --> 01:06:28.861
Well, after Saturday...

01:06:29.070 --> 01:06:32.031
...we shall be back
on Yorkshire pudding.

01:06:34.533 --> 01:06:36.285
Pelly, why don't you...

01:06:37.078 --> 01:06:39.288
...give up searching for your kingdom...

01:06:39.497 --> 01:06:41.749
...and come settle down
with us for good?

01:06:41.916 --> 01:06:44.293
That's jolly kind of you, Arthur.

01:06:44.543 --> 01:06:46.629
I mean, I love the bed and all that...

01:06:46.879 --> 01:06:50.591
...but the truth is I don't find things
too restful around here.

01:06:50.758 --> 01:06:53.260
I can't help wishing
that you'd stop...

01:06:53.427 --> 01:06:54.804
...thinking...

01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:56.931
...and leave well enough alone.

01:06:57.098 --> 01:07:00.601
- I'm all against these new ideas of yours.
- What new ideas?

01:07:00.851 --> 01:07:03.104
Any new ideas.

01:07:03.562 --> 01:07:08.234
Best people whacking best people.
That's not right. That's not.

01:07:08.901 --> 01:07:11.946
The chaps downstairs,
they're gnashing mad.

01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:13.447
Gnashing.

01:07:16.992 --> 01:07:18.619
It's all his fault, you know.

01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:20.955
Emperor Charlemagne there.

01:07:21.706 --> 01:07:24.500
He has no activities,
that's his trouble.

01:07:24.709 --> 01:07:27.169
No secular pleasures.

01:07:27.628 --> 01:07:29.130
Quiet, Pelly!

01:07:31.132 --> 01:07:33.426
<i>Excusez,</i> uh....

01:07:33.592 --> 01:07:35.136
Ahem, me.

01:07:36.137 --> 01:07:38.514
Uh, but do you not have
any, uh, activities?

01:07:39.181 --> 01:07:41.684
Any, uh, hobbies? Any, uh...?

01:07:46.188 --> 01:07:47.440
No, Pellinore.

01:07:47.648 --> 01:07:49.066
There, you see.
Do you see?

01:07:49.275 --> 01:07:52.987
Now why can't he be like the other chaps
instead of like himself?

01:07:53.195 --> 01:07:56.282
Why can't he come home of an evening,
hang up his shield...

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:59.994
...and do something
that he can be ashamed of? Hmm?

01:08:01.287 --> 01:08:02.955
You sure he's French?

01:08:03.372 --> 01:08:04.498
Pelly.

01:08:04.790 --> 01:08:06.542
I'm afraid milord is right.

01:08:13.883 --> 01:08:17.136
All fanatics are irritating, Pellinore.

01:08:18.345 --> 01:08:20.639
And I am a fanatic.

01:08:22.725 --> 01:08:25.728
And I don't enjoy it
any more than you do.

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:36.113
Lance, didn't you have
a change to suggest?

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:42.328
We can discuss my idea tomorrow.
If you will excuse me.

01:08:52.587 --> 01:08:56.550
While I was napping, did I miss
any improvements in chivalry?

01:08:59.678 --> 01:09:01.764
No, milady.
If you will excuse me--

01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:05.600
<i>Monsieur</i>, when you're arranging things
with God tonight...

01:09:05.810 --> 01:09:08.895
...do be sure to give us
fine weather tomorrow.

01:09:18.613 --> 01:09:20.407
- Good night, sire.
- Good night, Lance.

01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:22.408
Good night, Pellinore.

01:09:22.618 --> 01:09:24.118
Good night.

01:09:30.751 --> 01:09:34.380
Heard the latest? He believes his purity
gives him miraculous powers. Heh.

01:09:36.256 --> 01:09:39.635
He was undoubtedly referring
to his physical prowess.

01:09:39.844 --> 01:09:41.470
Which is vast, indeed.

01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:44.390
Oh, yes. Well,
we'll see about that tomorrow.

01:09:44.598 --> 01:09:48.560
Sagramore, Lionel and Dinadan
have all challenged him to a joust.

01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:50.395
Three damn strong men!

01:09:51.856 --> 01:09:54.441
- All three in one day?
- Quite, exactly.

01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:56.777
Isn't it marvelous? Marvelous!

01:09:56.944 --> 01:09:58.445
Exactly, yes!

01:09:58.737 --> 01:10:00.781
I tell you, Arthur.

01:10:00.948 --> 01:10:03.534
I've never met anyone like him.

01:10:03.742 --> 01:10:04.869
I mean...

01:10:05.077 --> 01:10:06.787
...he has no lady.

01:10:07.454 --> 01:10:09.707
Talks to no one but you and God...

01:10:09.915 --> 01:10:13.252
...crammed full of religion,
an all-around unpleasant fellow.

01:10:13.460 --> 01:10:16.338
I can't wait until tomorrow.
It'll be a jolly massacre.

01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.342
Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.

01:10:20.509 --> 01:10:24.638
I'm really looking forward to it.
It's going to be marvelous. Ha, ha.

01:10:27.641 --> 01:10:30.144
A note of thanks from Sir Lionel.

01:10:30.853 --> 01:10:34.815
I've promised he can carry
my kerchief in the joust tomorrow.

01:10:37.318 --> 01:10:38.360
Jenny.

01:10:38.527 --> 01:10:41.113
I would be most grateful if you...

01:10:41.322 --> 01:10:44.366
...would withdraw your permission
from Sir Lionel.

01:10:44.992 --> 01:10:47.870
Uh, I don't think I could.
It would be rather awkward.

01:10:48.078 --> 01:10:51.373
Then allow Lancelot
to carry it against Sagramore.

01:10:51.540 --> 01:10:54.543
- I've promised my kerchief to him.
- Then against Dinadan?

01:10:54.752 --> 01:10:59.089
I've promised him too.
He asked so prettily, I couldn't refuse.

01:10:59.298 --> 01:11:00.966
Well, this is appalling, Jenny.

01:11:01.133 --> 01:11:04.219
It will seem to the court
that you are championing his defeat.

01:11:04.428 --> 01:11:08.265
Perhaps he won't be. He knocked
you unconscious. You became friends.

01:11:08.474 --> 01:11:11.852
He may knock them out,
and they'll all take a house together.

01:11:12.019 --> 01:11:14.772
I realize he's having
a difficult time adjusting.

01:11:14.980 --> 01:11:16.440
But he's a stranger.

01:11:16.649 --> 01:11:19.360
He's not even English.
He's French.

01:11:19.526 --> 01:11:21.528
Well, he suffers in translation.

01:11:21.695 --> 01:11:23.197
Jenny, I ask you--

01:11:23.405 --> 01:11:26.825
I believe you're jealous of the knights
and their attentions to me.

01:11:26.992 --> 01:11:30.204
- Are you, my love?
- Jealous? What absolute rubbish!

01:11:30.371 --> 01:11:33.207
You know I am delighted
the court adores you so.

01:11:33.415 --> 01:11:35.376
I trust you as God above.

01:11:36.043 --> 01:11:39.296
You have dragged me off the subject
and I want you back on it.

01:11:39.505 --> 01:11:42.007
Will you withdraw those kerchiefs?

01:11:42.216 --> 01:11:44.009
Only if you command me as king.

01:11:47.638 --> 01:11:48.806
If I do...

01:11:49.890 --> 01:11:51.100
...will you forgive me?

01:11:52.059 --> 01:11:53.227
Never.

01:11:54.061 --> 01:11:57.564
Then, if I ask you as a husband,
will you as a favor?

01:11:57.731 --> 01:12:01.235
I find him overbearing and pretentious.
The knights are against him.

01:12:01.443 --> 01:12:04.738
Can we not stay on the subject?

01:12:04.947 --> 01:12:07.074
There's nothing more to be said.

01:12:11.245 --> 01:12:13.872
If the king wishes me to withdraw
what I have given...

01:12:14.081 --> 01:12:17.251
...let him command me
and Yours Humbly will graciously obey.

01:12:18.252 --> 01:12:19.878
What, what.

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:45.529
Blast you, Merlyn!
This is all your fault!

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:47.948
<i>You swore that you had taught me</i>

01:12:48.115 --> 01:12:49.283
<i>Everything from A to Z</i>

01:12:49.491 --> 01:12:51.618
<i>With nary an omission in between</i>

01:12:52.327 --> 01:12:55.164
<i>Well, I shall tell you what
You obviously forgot</i>

01:12:55.372 --> 01:12:57.958
<i>That's how a ruler rules a queen</i>

01:13:02.504 --> 01:13:05.591
<i>And what of teaching me
By turning me to animal and bird</i>

01:13:05.799 --> 01:13:07.885
<i>From beaver
To the smallest bobolink?</i>

01:13:08.635 --> 01:13:11.305
<i>I should have had a whirl
At changing to a girl</i>

01:13:11.513 --> 01:13:14.099
<i>To learn the way the creatures think</i>

01:13:21.065 --> 01:13:23.192
<i>But wasn't there a night</i>

01:13:23.400 --> 01:13:26.612
<i>On a summer long gone by</i>

01:13:26.987 --> 01:13:30.574
<i>We passed a couple
Wrangling away</i>

01:13:31.742 --> 01:13:33.202
<i>And did I not say</i>

01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:36.997
<i>Merlyn What if that chap were I</i>

01:13:37.164 --> 01:13:41.251
<i>And did he not give counsel
And say</i>

01:13:43.545 --> 01:13:45.089
What was it now?

01:13:45.297 --> 01:13:48.258
<i>Oh, my mind's a wall</i>

01:13:49.843 --> 01:13:52.346
<i>Oh, yes! By Jove!</i>

01:13:53.180 --> 01:13:54.681
<i>Now I recall</i>

01:13:56.517 --> 01:14:00.187
<i>How to handle a woman</i>

01:14:01.522 --> 01:14:05.734
<i>There's a way
Said the wise old man</i>

01:14:06.860 --> 01:14:10.697
<i>A way known by every woman</i>

01:14:11.365 --> 01:14:15.702
<i>Since the whole rigmarole began</i>

01:14:17.037 --> 01:14:20.541
<i>Do I flatter her?
I begged him answer</i>

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:24.878
<i>Do I threaten or cajole or plead?</i>

01:14:26.046 --> 01:14:30.050
<i>Do I brood or play the gay romancer?</i>

01:14:30.884 --> 01:14:35.264
<i>Said he, smiling No, indeed!</i>

01:14:37.391 --> 01:14:41.311
<i>How to handle a woman</i>

01:14:42.229 --> 01:14:47.442
<i>Mark me well
I will tell you, sir</i>

01:14:47.734 --> 01:14:52.739
<i>The way to handle a woman</i>

01:14:52.906 --> 01:14:56.243
<i>Is to love her</i>

01:14:57.911 --> 01:14:59.204
<i>Simply</i>

01:14:59.413 --> 01:15:03.083
<i>Love her</i>

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:08.881
<i>Merely love her</i>

01:15:09.089 --> 01:15:11.592
<i>Love her</i>

01:15:12.384 --> 01:15:16.221
<i>Love her</i>

01:15:26.273 --> 01:15:28.817
What's wrong, Jenny?

01:15:31.445 --> 01:15:34.239
Where are you these days?

01:15:36.408 --> 01:15:38.243
What are you thinking?

01:15:42.748 --> 01:15:44.917
I don't understand you.

01:15:46.418 --> 01:15:49.296
But no matter.
Merlyn told me once:

01:15:49.504 --> 01:15:54.176
"Never be disturbed if you don't
understand what a woman is thinking.

01:15:54.384 --> 01:15:56.303
They don't do it very often."

01:15:56.803 --> 01:16:00.140
But what do you do
while they're doing it?

01:16:06.146 --> 01:16:09.149
<i>How to handle a woman</i>

01:16:10.484 --> 01:16:14.655
<i>Mark me well
And I'll tell you, sir</i>

01:16:16.823 --> 01:16:22.329
<i>The way to handle a woman</i>

01:16:22.496 --> 01:16:27.167
<i>Is to love her</i>

01:16:28.335 --> 01:16:29.503
<i>Simply</i>

01:16:29.670 --> 01:16:34.007
<i>Love her</i>

01:16:34.174 --> 01:16:39.846
<i>Merely love her</i>

01:16:40.013 --> 01:16:43.767
<i>Love her</i>

01:16:44.351 --> 01:16:45.394
Oh.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:46.895
Just...

01:16:47.771 --> 01:16:49.189
...love her.

01:17:37.529 --> 01:17:38.989
Here comes Sir Lionel.

01:18:35.796 --> 01:18:36.838
One.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:46.139
Watch the way Sir Sagramore maneuvers
his horse. It's extraordinary.

01:19:04.658 --> 01:19:08.036
You see how he drives to the right?
And then suddenly....

01:19:12.332 --> 01:19:14.000
Ah, how clever!

01:19:14.167 --> 01:19:17.295
He maneuvered his horse
right out from under himself.

01:19:17.504 --> 01:19:19.005
What control!

01:19:29.391 --> 01:19:30.851
Two, Jenny.

01:20:26.448 --> 01:20:27.908
Hyah!

01:20:56.478 --> 01:20:57.729
Arthur!

01:21:41.773 --> 01:21:43.108
He's dead, Jenny.

01:22:47.964 --> 01:22:49.549
Please!

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.636
Please.

01:22:55.722 --> 01:22:56.890
Live!

01:22:57.515 --> 01:22:58.558
Live!

01:22:59.017 --> 01:23:00.560
Live.

01:23:00.769 --> 01:23:01.811
Live.

01:23:02.896 --> 01:23:04.356
I beg you.

01:23:06.399 --> 01:23:08.818
Live. Live.

01:23:09.694 --> 01:23:11.237
Live.

01:23:11.613 --> 01:23:13.531
- Live. Live.
- Lance.

01:23:14.491 --> 01:23:16.242
- Live. Please.
- Lance, Lance.

01:23:44.771 --> 01:23:47.107
He lives! He lives!

01:26:30.228 --> 01:26:31.688
Dap.

01:26:32.689 --> 01:26:35.149
I'm trembling with fear.

01:26:41.614 --> 01:26:42.949
And the strength...

01:26:43.157 --> 01:26:45.994
...has left my arms.

01:26:47.495 --> 01:26:49.873
And terrible feelings...

01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.292
...burn within me.

01:26:53.543 --> 01:26:54.752
Tell me.

01:26:56.421 --> 01:26:58.548
You're older than I.

01:27:00.300 --> 01:27:01.759
You know this earth...

01:27:01.968 --> 01:27:03.636
...better than I.

01:27:07.974 --> 01:27:10.351
I only fell upon it...

01:27:10.768 --> 01:27:12.478
...a few hours ago.

01:27:14.981 --> 01:27:17.609
What are you talking about?

01:27:20.528 --> 01:27:21.988
Guenevere.

01:27:36.336 --> 01:27:37.712
Wait, Pelly.

01:27:38.338 --> 01:27:39.380
What?

01:27:40.632 --> 01:27:43.343
You've never been in love...

01:27:43.551 --> 01:27:45.011
...have you, Pelly?

01:27:45.678 --> 01:27:46.679
Once.

01:27:46.888 --> 01:27:50.975
But not lately.
Now I'm not young enough.

01:27:51.392 --> 01:27:53.061
Or not old enough.

01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:57.273
And I'm too young and too old.

01:27:58.066 --> 01:28:00.360
Too old not to know that fears...

01:28:00.568 --> 01:28:02.737
...can be imaginary.

01:28:03.613 --> 01:28:07.450
And too young not to be...

01:28:07.659 --> 01:28:10.495
...tormented by them.

01:28:28.221 --> 01:28:30.348
Forgive me, milady,
for disturbing you.

01:28:32.392 --> 01:28:35.353
Clarinda told me
Arthur was expected here.

01:28:36.396 --> 01:28:37.605
Yes, he is.

01:29:24.527 --> 01:29:26.738
Jenny, I....

01:29:28.114 --> 01:29:29.449
I love you.

01:29:35.788 --> 01:29:37.373
God forgive me...

01:29:37.582 --> 01:29:38.875
...but I do!

01:29:44.130 --> 01:29:46.674
Then God forgive us both, Lance.

01:29:48.676 --> 01:29:50.094
Jenny, Jenny.

01:29:50.261 --> 01:29:52.472
Oh, what a glorious day!

01:29:54.182 --> 01:29:55.391
This is your day, Lance.

01:29:55.558 --> 01:29:57.310
And at last you shall receive...

01:29:57.477 --> 01:30:00.646
...your earned and proper knighthood.

01:30:02.315 --> 01:30:03.566
Oh, Lance. Lance.

01:30:05.985 --> 01:30:07.320
Jenny.

01:30:08.905 --> 01:30:12.450
Unfortunately,
sainthood is not in my power.

01:30:14.577 --> 01:30:19.707
Heh, before the ceremony, we three
will have a nice quiet drink together.

01:30:21.667 --> 01:30:23.503
It was on such a day as this...

01:30:23.669 --> 01:30:27.173
...that the idea of the Round Table
was given birth.

01:30:28.216 --> 01:30:29.634
Remember, Jenny?

01:30:31.302 --> 01:30:34.055
Jenny, Lance.

01:30:41.896 --> 01:30:43.731
To the Round Table!

01:32:41.057 --> 01:32:42.391
To be invested...

01:32:43.059 --> 01:32:46.062
...Knight of the Round Table
of England...

01:32:47.647 --> 01:32:50.399
...of the Castle of Joyous Gard...

01:32:51.150 --> 01:32:53.653
...Lancelot Du Lac.

01:34:02.847 --> 01:34:03.889
Excalibur.

01:34:17.236 --> 01:34:18.571
Arise...

01:34:18.821 --> 01:34:21.198
...Sir Lancelot.

01:35:52.665 --> 01:35:54.083
Proposition:

01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:56.710
If I could choose...

01:35:56.919 --> 01:36:00.256
...from every woman
who breathes on this earth...

01:36:00.506 --> 01:36:03.008
...the face I would most love...

01:36:03.342 --> 01:36:07.596
...the smile, the touch, the heart...

01:36:08.013 --> 01:36:10.433
...the voice, the laugh,
the soul itself...

01:36:10.641 --> 01:36:15.312
...every detail and feature
to the last strand of the hair...

01:36:15.729 --> 01:36:17.648
...they would all be Jenny's.

01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:20.025
Proposition:

01:36:20.443 --> 01:36:24.780
If I could choose from every man
who breathes on this earth...

01:36:24.989 --> 01:36:27.366
...a man for my brother...

01:36:27.533 --> 01:36:29.452
...a man for my son...

01:36:29.660 --> 01:36:32.705
...and a man for my friend...

01:36:32.872 --> 01:36:36.542
...they would all be Lance.

01:36:37.543 --> 01:36:39.044
I love them.

01:36:40.045 --> 01:36:44.300
I love them
and they answer me with pain...

01:36:44.717 --> 01:36:46.552
...and torment.

01:36:47.178 --> 01:36:50.139
Be it sin or not sin...

01:36:50.347 --> 01:36:53.851
...they have betrayed me
in their hearts...

01:36:54.059 --> 01:36:56.228
...and that's far sin enough.

01:36:56.562 --> 01:37:01.358
I can see it in their eyes.
I can feel it when they speak.

01:37:01.567 --> 01:37:04.570
And they must pay for it
and be punished.

01:37:05.070 --> 01:37:09.116
I shall not be wounded
and not return it in kind.

01:37:12.661 --> 01:37:15.748
I'm through with feeble hoping.

01:37:16.123 --> 01:37:17.708
I demand...

01:37:17.917 --> 01:37:21.921
...a man's vengeance!

01:37:36.185 --> 01:37:37.478
Proposition:

01:37:39.980 --> 01:37:41.524
I'm a king...

01:37:44.818 --> 01:37:46.153
...not a man.

01:37:46.362 --> 01:37:48.447
And a very civilized king.

01:37:49.281 --> 01:37:50.533
Could it...

01:37:51.450 --> 01:37:53.786
...possibly be civilized...

01:37:54.870 --> 01:37:57.164
...to destroy the thing I love?

01:37:58.290 --> 01:38:02.920
Could it possibly be civilized
to love myself above all?

01:38:04.463 --> 01:38:06.882
What about their pain...

01:38:08.425 --> 01:38:10.427
...and their torment?

01:38:13.931 --> 01:38:16.725
Did they ask for this calamity?

01:38:18.310 --> 01:38:20.187
Can passion...

01:38:20.396 --> 01:38:22.314
...be selected?

01:38:28.445 --> 01:38:31.073
Is there any doubt...

01:38:32.032 --> 01:38:35.160
...of their devotion to me,
and to our Table?

01:38:50.217 --> 01:38:52.511
By God...

01:38:53.637 --> 01:38:56.849
...I shall be a king!

01:38:59.685 --> 01:39:03.355
This is the time of King Arthur...

01:39:03.564 --> 01:39:04.898
...when we shall...

01:39:05.899 --> 01:39:08.027
...reach for the stars!

01:39:08.193 --> 01:39:10.571
This is the time of King Arthur...

01:39:10.779 --> 01:39:15.034
...when violence is not strength,
and compassion is not weakness.

01:39:15.993 --> 01:39:18.954
We are civilized!

01:39:21.332 --> 01:39:23.334
Resolved:

01:39:24.543 --> 01:39:28.839
We shall live through this together!

01:39:29.256 --> 01:39:31.216
Excalibur!

01:39:31.592 --> 01:39:32.801
They...

01:39:34.637 --> 01:39:35.846
...you...

01:39:36.055 --> 01:39:37.431
...and I.

01:39:39.391 --> 01:39:41.393
And may...

01:39:41.685 --> 01:39:44.897
...God have mercy on us all.

01:42:32.314 --> 01:42:33.357
Your Majesty!

01:42:34.024 --> 01:42:35.067
Your Majesty!

01:42:35.275 --> 01:42:38.362
I come as an emissary
from the village of Glenfield.

01:42:38.904 --> 01:42:40.739
We have 23 shops...

01:42:40.906 --> 01:42:45.327
...and not one door with a bolt.
And not a chain on a stable...

01:42:45.536 --> 01:42:48.747
...a bar on a gate,
a latch with a lock.

01:42:49.414 --> 01:42:52.584
And our children walk free on the roads.

01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:57.714
Because we live
in the England of King Arthur.

01:43:01.802 --> 01:43:04.847
Here are the keys of Glenfield,
Your Majesty.

01:43:05.389 --> 01:43:07.391
We need them no more.

01:43:13.188 --> 01:43:17.568
You have been
the queen's lover for years.

01:43:17.734 --> 01:43:19.236
Get on your feet...

01:43:19.444 --> 01:43:21.029
...and defend your slander!

01:43:21.697 --> 01:43:23.907
Does killing me kill the truth?

01:43:25.784 --> 01:43:30.831
There's a poison in this court
that will kill us all!

01:43:32.499 --> 01:43:33.917
Get up and fight!

01:43:34.501 --> 01:43:35.836
Get up and fight!

01:43:36.003 --> 01:43:39.172
I give you this.
And I'll use dagger alone.

01:43:49.516 --> 01:43:50.726
I...

01:43:51.810 --> 01:43:54.062
...take it back.

01:43:58.817 --> 01:44:01.695
If the king grants you clemency...

01:44:02.195 --> 01:44:03.989
...you shall be banished.

01:44:05.824 --> 01:44:08.327
If not, you hang.

01:44:17.169 --> 01:44:18.420
Clemency is granted.

01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:25.237
Is he dead?

01:45:30.033 --> 01:45:32.369
Bruce has withdrawn the accusation.

01:45:35.580 --> 01:45:36.581
And Arthur?

01:45:38.083 --> 01:45:39.710
Clemency.

01:45:40.794 --> 01:45:45.257
What an agony for him.
Seven of his knights banished.

01:45:46.800 --> 01:45:50.595
If those charges
had not been withdrawn...

01:45:51.138 --> 01:45:53.265
...what would I have done?

01:45:55.809 --> 01:45:57.269
Commit murder?

01:46:03.358 --> 01:46:05.027
I don't know.

01:46:07.362 --> 01:46:10.907
At least he's still spared
the anguish of the truth.

01:46:13.285 --> 01:46:14.953
Jenny.

01:46:16.288 --> 01:46:17.748
He knows.

01:46:18.874 --> 01:46:20.000
Oh, no.

01:46:20.167 --> 01:46:22.377
- I'm certain.
- He couldn't.

01:46:24.671 --> 01:46:27.966
Arthur would never banish
the knights so unjustly.

01:46:28.133 --> 01:46:31.928
It's your conscience talking.
It's impatient for you to be punished.

01:46:32.095 --> 01:46:33.805
- No, no.
- He knows!

01:46:33.972 --> 01:46:36.641
Well, why would he change the law?

01:46:36.850 --> 01:46:40.103
Rule out the use of swords
to settle disputes...

01:46:40.312 --> 01:46:42.522
...and replace it
with a court and judge?

01:46:42.731 --> 01:46:45.734
- He hasn't done that.
- He's preparing to!

01:46:45.942 --> 01:46:48.987
And if no evidence can be produced...

01:46:49.196 --> 01:46:52.240
...then the matters
cannot be disputed at all.

01:46:52.449 --> 01:46:54.910
And there will be no evidence.

01:46:55.118 --> 01:46:57.412
- He'll see to that.
- How?

01:46:59.331 --> 01:47:03.210
He will never leave this castle
unless one of us is with him.

01:47:05.587 --> 01:47:08.965
He will never leave us alone again.
Never!

01:47:10.175 --> 01:47:11.510
Oh, God!

01:47:11.676 --> 01:47:13.678
What will become of us?

01:47:13.887 --> 01:47:15.514
What will become of me?

01:47:19.226 --> 01:47:20.519
Oh, Lance.

01:47:20.685 --> 01:47:22.229
How long can I...

01:47:22.437 --> 01:47:25.524
...go on asking the same question
and not lose my mind?

01:47:25.732 --> 01:47:28.151
Or is my mind gone from me now?

01:47:28.318 --> 01:47:29.486
Lance, Lance.

01:47:29.653 --> 01:47:31.530
What shall we do?

01:47:31.696 --> 01:47:33.031
What shall we do?

01:47:38.703 --> 01:47:41.540
I know what I should do.

01:47:41.873 --> 01:47:44.501
Leave and never come back.

01:47:45.544 --> 01:47:47.379
Today. This minute.

01:47:50.465 --> 01:47:52.843
But to leave so abruptly...

01:47:53.426 --> 01:47:55.345
...it would seem a confession.

01:47:58.098 --> 01:47:59.558
No.

01:47:59.724 --> 01:48:02.227
Better in a week or two.

01:48:02.602 --> 01:48:04.062
Or a month.

01:48:06.148 --> 01:48:07.941
How can I go, Jenny?

01:48:08.358 --> 01:48:09.943
Look at you.

01:48:11.319 --> 01:48:13.238
When would I?

01:48:16.074 --> 01:48:19.286
<i>If ever I would leave you</i>

01:48:20.620 --> 01:48:24.958
<i>It wouldn't be in summer</i>

01:48:25.125 --> 01:48:27.294
<i>Seeing you in summer</i>

01:48:27.460 --> 01:48:32.424
<i>I never would go</i>

01:48:32.591 --> 01:48:37.470
<i>Your hair streaked with sunlight</i>

01:48:37.637 --> 01:48:42.142
<i>Your lips red as flame</i>

01:48:42.309 --> 01:48:46.605
<i>Your face with a luster</i>

01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:52.527
<i>That puts gold to shame</i>

01:48:53.320 --> 01:48:57.616
<i>But if I'd ever leave you</i>

01:48:57.824 --> 01:49:01.953
<i>It couldn't be in autumn</i>

01:49:02.162 --> 01:49:04.497
<i>How I'd leave in autumn</i>

01:49:04.831 --> 01:49:09.961
<i>I never would know</i>

01:49:10.170 --> 01:49:14.633
<i>I've seen how you sparkle</i>

01:49:15.008 --> 01:49:19.262
<i>When fall nips the air</i>

01:49:19.679 --> 01:49:24.100
<i>I know you in autumn</i>

01:49:24.851 --> 01:49:30.941
<i>And I must be there</i>

01:49:31.191 --> 01:49:33.193
<i>And could I leave you</i>

01:49:33.526 --> 01:49:38.114
<i>Running merrily through the snow?</i>

01:49:38.365 --> 01:49:41.368
<i>Or on a wintery evening</i>

01:49:42.202 --> 01:49:49.209
<i>When you catch the fire's glow?</i>

01:49:50.043 --> 01:49:55.882
<i>If ever I would leave you</i>

01:49:56.049 --> 01:49:59.386
<i>How could it be in springtime</i>

01:50:00.345 --> 01:50:02.639
<i>Knowing how in spring</i>

01:50:02.847 --> 01:50:07.560
<i>I'm bewitched by you so</i>

01:50:07.727 --> 01:50:12.899
<i>Oh, no Not in springtime</i>

01:50:13.066 --> 01:50:22.242
<i>Summer, winter or fall</i>

01:50:22.409 --> 01:50:29.416
<i>No, never could I leave you</i>

01:50:30.083 --> 01:50:34.462
<i>At all</i>

01:50:43.305 --> 01:50:45.390
I want you to go, Lance.

01:50:45.890 --> 01:50:47.434
Jenny, Jenny.

01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:48.935
I do.

01:50:49.394 --> 01:50:52.731
I don't worry about the future.
We have none.

01:50:54.899 --> 01:50:57.527
But if anything happened to the past...

01:50:59.070 --> 01:51:01.197
...any more shame...

01:51:01.406 --> 01:51:05.452
...and any more guilt
could make ruin of it.

01:51:08.204 --> 01:51:10.206
The past is all I have.

01:51:13.918 --> 01:51:16.588
<i>The past is all I have.</i>

01:52:59.149 --> 01:53:03.695
<i>If ever I would leave you</i>

01:53:04.028 --> 01:53:07.907
<i>How could it be in springtime</i>

01:53:08.116 --> 01:53:10.743
<i>Knowing how in spring</i>

01:53:10.952 --> 01:53:15.957
<i>I'm bewitched by you so</i>

01:53:16.124 --> 01:53:21.171
<i>Oh, no Not in springtime</i>

01:53:21.629 --> 01:53:22.839
<i>Summer</i>

01:53:23.006 --> 01:53:25.049
<i>Winter</i>

01:53:25.216 --> 01:53:31.389
<i>Or fall</i>

01:53:32.307 --> 01:53:39.063
<i>No, never could I leave you</i>

01:53:40.148 --> 01:53:44.360
<i>At all</i>

01:54:03.713 --> 01:54:06.508
Damn it, Arthur!
Forgive me, damn it.

01:54:08.092 --> 01:54:10.762
But damn it!
If this banishing goes on...

01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:14.390
...there'll be more out there
than there are in here.

01:54:18.603 --> 01:54:19.812
Your Majesty.

01:54:19.979 --> 01:54:24.025
There's a young man from Scotland
who brings you royal greetings.

01:54:24.609 --> 01:54:29.280
His Majesty is occupied.
Ask him to return in the afternoon.

01:54:36.120 --> 01:54:37.705
Arthur.

01:54:39.791 --> 01:54:43.795
The uglier the truth,
the truer the friend that tells you...

01:54:44.003 --> 01:54:46.297
...and unless you are told the truth...

01:54:47.131 --> 01:54:49.551
...your Round Table is doomed.

01:54:58.226 --> 01:54:59.811
Arthur.

01:55:00.186 --> 01:55:01.479
Guenevere...

01:55:01.646 --> 01:55:02.855
...and Lancelot...

01:55:05.024 --> 01:55:06.484
...have betrayed you.

01:55:06.985 --> 01:55:09.070
And because you don't know it...

01:55:09.279 --> 01:55:12.574
...innocent men are being punished.

01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:19.414
Pellinore, you will either...

01:55:19.998 --> 01:55:23.251
...withdraw
that treasonous allegation...

01:55:23.835 --> 01:55:25.336
...at once...

01:55:25.545 --> 01:55:27.547
...or defend it with your life!

01:55:28.006 --> 01:55:29.257
What?

01:55:29.591 --> 01:55:31.092
Now speak up!

01:55:31.301 --> 01:55:35.346
Which is it, Pellinore?
The sword or withdrawal?

01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:37.307
Well, I-- I....

01:55:37.724 --> 01:55:38.766
Guard!

01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:41.894
No, Arthur! Wait!

01:55:42.145 --> 01:55:44.606
Um, wait.

01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:52.488
I must have been mistaken, sir.

01:56:03.708 --> 01:56:05.209
Now, Pelly....

01:56:06.711 --> 01:56:09.672
Under this new civil law of mine
you can...

01:56:09.881 --> 01:56:13.092
...make that accusation again
without fear of your life...

01:56:13.301 --> 01:56:15.887
...if there is evidence,
which there is not, of course.

01:56:16.095 --> 01:56:19.057
Repetition, Pelly, is not evidence.

01:56:19.265 --> 01:56:20.767
Brilliant, Your Majesty!

01:56:21.517 --> 01:56:23.603
Not only wise but clever.

01:56:24.479 --> 01:56:28.608
- How dare you enter unannounced?
- But I was announced.

01:56:28.816 --> 01:56:31.486
And were you not informed
to return this afternoon?

01:56:31.694 --> 01:56:33.279
I'm busy this afternoon.

01:56:33.488 --> 01:56:35.114
By Jove!

01:56:35.323 --> 01:56:37.909
- What presumption!
- Don't touch me. I'm unarmed.

01:56:38.076 --> 01:56:41.663
Pelly, call the guard and have this
pompous young ass thrown out.

01:56:43.748 --> 01:56:44.791
Yes, do.

01:56:44.999 --> 01:56:47.752
Tell them His Majesty
wants Mordred evicted.

01:56:50.880 --> 01:56:52.507
Mordred?

01:56:53.424 --> 01:56:54.801
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:57.178
I'm Mordred.

01:57:01.808 --> 01:57:03.017
Wait, Pelly.

01:57:05.228 --> 01:57:07.105
I know this boy.

01:57:07.772 --> 01:57:08.773
He's...

01:57:09.607 --> 01:57:10.650
...the brother...

01:57:11.025 --> 01:57:12.985
...the half-brother....

01:57:13.736 --> 01:57:15.446
He's the son...

01:57:15.613 --> 01:57:19.242
...of the Princess Margause of Orkny.

01:57:19.701 --> 01:57:20.785
Please.

01:57:33.131 --> 01:57:34.257
So....

01:57:34.424 --> 01:57:38.594
This is the famous throne room
where sits His Majesty, King of England.

01:57:41.139 --> 01:57:43.015
It's quite handsome, really.

01:57:43.599 --> 01:57:44.976
Marvelous for parties.

01:57:46.519 --> 01:57:51.858
I had lost track of the time, Mordred.

01:57:52.525 --> 01:57:54.193
You've grown to manhood.

01:57:56.821 --> 01:57:58.156
How...

01:57:58.865 --> 01:58:00.199
...is your mother?

01:58:00.867 --> 01:58:02.994
As ravishing as ever.

01:58:04.495 --> 01:58:05.955
Which is hardly surprising.

01:58:06.164 --> 01:58:09.000
Vigilant selfishness
is wonderful for the skin.

01:58:09.459 --> 01:58:11.169
And Prince Claudius?

01:58:11.335 --> 01:58:13.838
Oh, I haven't seen him in a while.
He locked himself...

01:58:14.046 --> 01:58:17.008
...in a tower four years ago
to get away from Mother.

01:58:18.885 --> 01:58:22.597
Do you always sit there, or do you
sometimes switch with Guenevere?

01:58:22.805 --> 01:58:24.682
Protocol intrigues me.

01:58:25.892 --> 01:58:29.020
And where the famous Lancelot?

01:58:29.187 --> 01:58:31.606
Or does he stand in between?

01:58:34.317 --> 01:58:36.360
What brings you to Camelot, Mordred?

01:58:37.528 --> 01:58:41.240
A desire of blood, Your Majesty.
My brothers are here.

01:58:41.991 --> 01:58:43.534
Half-brothers.

01:58:45.745 --> 01:58:48.623
They'll be very, very,
very miserable to see me.

01:58:51.459 --> 01:58:54.295
Mother had a potion which took off
10 years and they...

01:58:54.504 --> 01:58:57.381
...gave it to me when I was 9
to make me minus one.

01:58:59.717 --> 01:59:03.387
You've come all this way to see
your brothers, whom you detest?

01:59:03.971 --> 01:59:07.725
That's hardly reason
for such a long journey.

01:59:08.559 --> 01:59:10.102
There's you, Your Majesty.

01:59:11.062 --> 01:59:14.524
I always wondered why old Claudius
detested me so.

01:59:14.899 --> 01:59:17.985
Then, heh, one day Mother told me
the marvelous news.

01:59:18.486 --> 01:59:19.862
He's not my father.

01:59:21.531 --> 01:59:23.783
How once when
she was visiting England...

01:59:23.991 --> 01:59:26.702
...she met an attractive young lad
called Arthur...

01:59:26.911 --> 01:59:28.538
...invited him to her room...

01:59:29.288 --> 01:59:30.456
...so on.

01:59:31.249 --> 01:59:33.042
Is that how the story goes?

01:59:34.418 --> 01:59:35.920
Yes.

01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:38.756
Yes, that's how the story goes.

01:59:39.924 --> 01:59:44.720
Imagine her surprise when that
young man became King of all England.

01:59:46.013 --> 01:59:49.141
Now that you're here,
what are your plans?

01:59:49.350 --> 01:59:51.519
My plans are your wishes, Your Majesty.

01:59:52.061 --> 01:59:55.815
Then you are to remain in Camelot
and become a knight of the Round Table.

01:59:56.023 --> 01:59:59.151
I admit you're not
very promising material...

01:59:59.360 --> 02:00:01.571
...but you have brains, youth...

02:00:01.863 --> 02:00:04.073
...and a proper heritage.

02:00:04.365 --> 02:00:06.701
Much could be done
if you applied yourself.

02:00:08.953 --> 02:00:09.996
I a knight?

02:00:14.083 --> 02:00:15.751
Come, Your Majesty!

02:00:16.002 --> 02:00:17.336
Look at me!

02:00:19.088 --> 02:00:22.592
I despise the sword, I loathe the spear,
and I detest horses.

02:00:22.800 --> 02:00:26.095
I've been taught to place needs
ahead of conscience...

02:00:26.304 --> 02:00:27.889
...comfort ahead of principle.

02:00:28.097 --> 02:00:31.267
I find charity offensive
and kindness a trap.

02:00:32.518 --> 02:00:34.437
I like my ladies married...

02:00:34.645 --> 02:00:37.440
...my willpower weak, my wine strong...

02:00:37.648 --> 02:00:39.901
...and my saints fallen.

02:00:42.987 --> 02:00:44.280
Come.

02:00:44.488 --> 02:00:47.033
What kind of knight
could you make of me, hmm?

02:00:48.367 --> 02:00:51.704
Put it that way,
it would take a miracle.

02:00:51.913 --> 02:00:55.666
And I'm told there's a shortage
of miracles at Camelot these days.

02:00:59.503 --> 02:01:01.923
I must warn you, Mordred...

02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:06.969
...that I am a civilized man
with occasional lapses.

02:01:08.137 --> 02:01:11.641
And far more seasoned rascals
than you have polished their souls.

02:01:11.849 --> 02:01:14.352
I advise you get out the wax.

02:01:15.019 --> 02:01:17.355
Better be rubbed clean...

02:01:17.563 --> 02:01:20.191
...than rubbed out?

02:01:21.400 --> 02:01:23.903
- Heh.
- You will dine with the queen and me...

02:01:24.111 --> 02:01:26.238
...and try
to get to know each other better.

02:01:27.198 --> 02:01:29.659
Good, I shall look forward
to meeting the queen.

02:01:29.909 --> 02:01:31.410
Mordred.

02:01:31.953 --> 02:01:34.872
You will leave when you are dismissed.

02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:40.211
And remember...

02:01:40.670 --> 02:01:42.380
...Mordred...

02:01:42.546 --> 02:01:44.674
...that I and I alone shall decide...

02:01:44.882 --> 02:01:49.679
...when you may address me
by the name that your kinship allows.

02:01:50.554 --> 02:01:52.932
But it shall remain unspoken...

02:01:53.140 --> 02:01:57.061
...till you have earned the right
by proper deeds.

02:01:57.728 --> 02:01:58.938
The adage...

02:01:59.563 --> 02:02:03.234
... "Blood is thicker than water"
was invented by ...

02:02:04.235 --> 02:02:06.404
...undeserving relatives.

02:02:08.197 --> 02:02:10.282
I look forward to seeing you this evening.

02:02:34.473 --> 02:02:36.767
It is simple, Pellinore.

02:02:37.435 --> 02:02:40.271
Once you get it
into that armored head of yours...

02:02:40.521 --> 02:02:44.066
...that all disputes
will be settled by law...

02:02:44.275 --> 02:02:47.278
...and not by bloodshed.

02:02:47.528 --> 02:02:49.905
Wart, I understand that perfectly.

02:02:50.114 --> 02:02:52.616
I do not understand how it works.

02:02:53.451 --> 02:02:55.244
Oh, Pelly.

02:02:55.411 --> 02:02:56.454
Um....

02:02:56.620 --> 02:03:00.124
Let us see. Supposing you
are accused of burning down a stable.

02:03:00.332 --> 02:03:01.459
Whose?

02:03:03.794 --> 02:03:06.881
Let us say a farmer named William.

02:03:08.299 --> 02:03:09.717
William?

02:03:09.884 --> 02:03:13.179
I wouldn't, of course,
but, uh, get along.

02:03:13.387 --> 02:03:15.973
Now, Pelly, you claim you haven't.

02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:17.641
What does he do?

02:03:17.808 --> 02:03:20.603
He holds his tongue
if he knows what's good for him...

02:03:20.811 --> 02:03:23.355
- ...or he'll get a sword through his chest.
- Oh, Pelly.

02:03:23.564 --> 02:03:26.859
- Pelly, he takes you to court.
- Ah.

02:03:27.026 --> 02:03:28.944
And we fight there.

02:03:30.029 --> 02:03:31.739
No, Pellinore.

02:03:31.906 --> 02:03:35.034
In court, there is a prosecutor
for Farmer William...

02:03:35.242 --> 02:03:37.828
...and a defender for you.

02:03:38.037 --> 02:03:39.121
Oh, I see!

02:03:39.288 --> 02:03:42.208
Ah! I see. And they fight.

02:03:43.834 --> 02:03:46.837
No, Pellinore. A jury decides.

02:03:47.004 --> 02:03:51.050
That is why
it is called "trial by jury."

02:03:51.258 --> 02:03:53.719
The jury?
Who in thunderation are they?

02:03:53.928 --> 02:03:55.805
It's none of their damn business.

02:03:56.013 --> 02:03:59.350
But you don't know them, Pelly.
And they don't know you.

02:03:59.558 --> 02:04:03.062
If they don't know me
and they don't know Farmer William...

02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:05.898
...how can you expect them
to care a fig who wins?

02:04:06.107 --> 02:04:09.985
How can you get a fair decision
from people so impartial?

02:04:11.403 --> 02:04:14.615
That is precisely the point, Pelly.

02:04:14.824 --> 02:04:17.785
They are impartial
and there will be no bloodshed.

02:04:17.993 --> 02:04:22.414
If that jury finds me guilty,
there'll be plenty of bloodshed.

02:04:22.623 --> 02:04:24.667
I'll have a whack
at every last one of them.

02:04:24.875 --> 02:04:28.003
Then you will be charged
with murder, Pelly.

02:04:28.212 --> 02:04:30.131
The ruddy thing's endless!

02:04:30.422 --> 02:04:33.592
Another jury finds me guilty,
and I'll have to whack them...

02:04:33.801 --> 02:04:36.053
...and so on and so on
and whacking and--

02:04:36.220 --> 02:04:38.055
Oh, Pelly....

02:04:39.223 --> 02:04:42.226
Pellinore, forget it!
You will never burn down a stable...

02:04:42.393 --> 02:04:46.230
...you will never know a farmer
named William and you will never...

02:04:46.438 --> 02:04:48.858
...ever be found in a court.

02:04:52.403 --> 02:04:54.530
Not without my ruddy sword, I won't.

02:05:05.416 --> 02:05:07.251
Oh, Jenny.

02:05:08.586 --> 02:05:10.337
Jenny, I'm getting old.

02:05:12.923 --> 02:05:14.300
It's true.

02:05:15.134 --> 02:05:16.927
I thought about it this morning.

02:05:17.970 --> 02:05:20.848
I walked to the stables
as briskly as ever...

02:05:21.056 --> 02:05:23.934
...and arrived much later
than I expected to.

02:05:24.643 --> 02:05:27.771
You've been closeted far too long
with the civil court.

02:05:29.356 --> 02:05:31.150
I'm glad it's finally opening.

02:05:31.442 --> 02:05:33.110
Ten o'clock tomorrow morning.

02:05:34.653 --> 02:05:38.282
- The first English court.
- May I attend the ceremony?

02:05:38.490 --> 02:05:41.076
Would you, Jenny?
Everyone would love it.

02:05:41.285 --> 02:05:42.703
Yes, of course.

02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:44.538
It may be our greatest achievement.

02:05:45.915 --> 02:05:46.957
Come in.

02:05:49.335 --> 02:05:50.920
Your Majesty.

02:05:51.462 --> 02:05:52.504
Oh, Lance.

02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:57.843
Good day, milady.

02:05:58.135 --> 02:05:59.553
Good day, Lance.

02:06:06.810 --> 02:06:09.730
- Arthur, it's about Mordred.
- Mordred?

02:06:09.897 --> 02:06:11.774
Must we talk about Mordred?

02:06:12.233 --> 02:06:15.736
This is the first day in a month
he'll not be here for dinner...

02:06:15.945 --> 02:06:18.113
...and that makes it seem like a party.

02:06:19.657 --> 02:06:22.493
Arthur, get rid of him.

02:06:23.118 --> 02:06:25.496
He's bent on the destruction
of the Table.

02:06:25.996 --> 02:06:27.831
He's setting knight against knight.

02:06:27.998 --> 02:06:31.001
Making them yearn for their own lands.

02:06:32.419 --> 02:06:36.966
Every evening like a witch over a
cauldron he mixes wine and disloyalty.

02:06:37.341 --> 02:06:39.260
I know of his activities, Lance.

02:06:40.010 --> 02:06:43.973
Do you also know he is in constant touch
with the knights you banished?

02:06:44.932 --> 02:06:46.517
And they're raising an army.

02:06:47.184 --> 02:06:48.352
I know.

02:06:50.479 --> 02:06:53.190
And it is my own fault.

02:06:54.858 --> 02:06:58.779
I should have officially recognized him
when I took the throne.

02:06:59.029 --> 02:07:00.823
It is the proper procedure.

02:07:01.448 --> 02:07:04.451
I intended to do it
and I should have done it.

02:07:05.035 --> 02:07:06.287
But I didn't.

02:07:07.288 --> 02:07:08.664
I couldn't.

02:07:08.872 --> 02:07:10.040
I hadn't...

02:07:11.292 --> 02:07:12.710
...counted on...

02:07:16.171 --> 02:07:19.341
...caring for Jenny as much...

02:07:21.760 --> 02:07:24.888
...and I had hoped that one day
our child would sit...

02:07:26.181 --> 02:07:28.142
...on the throne of England.

02:07:31.854 --> 02:07:34.189
The fates...

02:07:34.523 --> 02:07:36.358
...have not been kind.

02:07:36.734 --> 02:07:37.776
The fates...

02:07:37.985 --> 02:07:41.196
...must not have the last word, Lance.

02:07:43.449 --> 02:07:46.368
We have been through
much together, we three.

02:07:47.703 --> 02:07:50.998
And by the sword, Excalibur,
we will go through this.

02:07:51.206 --> 02:07:54.668
Oh, Mordred is filled with hatred,
trying to destroy those I love...

02:07:55.002 --> 02:07:58.255
...and trying to make
his inheritance come faster.

02:07:58.464 --> 02:08:01.091
But we must not
give him the opportunity.

02:08:02.593 --> 02:08:04.178
We must not let...

02:08:05.471 --> 02:08:09.475
...our passions destroy our dreams.

02:08:14.396 --> 02:08:16.357
Let him cross my path.

02:08:16.565 --> 02:08:18.067
I'll run him through.

02:08:19.443 --> 02:08:21.278
You will not, Lance.

02:08:25.616 --> 02:08:27.368
He's your mortal enemy!

02:08:27.951 --> 02:08:29.411
He's my son.

02:08:30.371 --> 02:08:34.458
He's all there is of me.
The only child I will ever have.

02:08:37.544 --> 02:08:40.881
Oh, it may be madness,
but somehow I hope that there is...

02:08:41.090 --> 02:08:43.717
...something of me in him
that I can reach.

02:08:45.969 --> 02:08:48.597
So I will have your word, Lance?

02:08:50.432 --> 02:08:52.768
You have my word.

02:09:10.577 --> 02:09:12.788
Would you like to be alone, Arthur?

02:09:12.996 --> 02:09:15.749
No, Jenny. Jenny, please.
Please don't go.

02:09:20.003 --> 02:09:21.839
What did you do today, Jenny?

02:09:27.052 --> 02:09:28.512
Just trivial things.

02:09:28.679 --> 02:09:32.349
Oh! That's exactly
what I want to hear about.

02:09:33.100 --> 02:09:35.227
Tempests and tea cups...

02:09:36.019 --> 02:09:39.440
...mountains made out of molehills,
anything.

02:09:39.857 --> 02:09:42.025
Anything you can think of...

02:09:42.192 --> 02:09:44.445
...that is not fit for a king.

02:09:51.618 --> 02:09:54.872
<i>What do the simple folk do</i>

02:09:56.373 --> 02:09:59.543
<i>To help them escape when they're blue?</i>

02:10:01.378 --> 02:10:05.883
<i>The shepherd who is ailing
The milkmaid who is glum</i>

02:10:06.467 --> 02:10:10.387
<i>The cobbler who is wailing
From nailing his thumb</i>

02:10:11.054 --> 02:10:14.057
<i>When they're beset and besieged</i>

02:10:15.058 --> 02:10:18.395
<i>The folks not noblesse-ly obliged</i>

02:10:19.396 --> 02:10:23.400
<i>However do they manage
To shed their weary lot?</i>

02:10:23.734 --> 02:10:25.569
<i>Oh, what</i>

02:10:25.903 --> 02:10:29.072
<i>Do simple folk do?</i>

02:10:30.240 --> 02:10:31.408
<i>We do not</i>

02:10:33.911 --> 02:10:35.329
<i>I have been informed</i>

02:10:35.496 --> 02:10:37.247
<i>By those who know them well</i>

02:10:37.581 --> 02:10:40.751
<i>They find relief in quite a clever way</i>

02:10:41.418 --> 02:10:45.088
<i>When they're sorely pressed
They whistle for a spell</i>

02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:48.926
<i>And whistling seems
To brighten up their day</i>

02:10:49.760 --> 02:10:52.429
<i>And that's what</i>

02:10:52.763 --> 02:10:55.265
<i>Simple folk do</i>

02:10:56.099 --> 02:10:57.768
<i>So they say</i>

02:10:58.101 --> 02:10:59.436
They just whistle?

02:11:01.605 --> 02:11:02.606
So they say.

02:11:34.596 --> 02:11:37.933
<i>What else do the simple folk do</i>

02:11:38.934 --> 02:11:42.271
<i>To perk up the heart and get through?</i>

02:11:43.272 --> 02:11:47.109
<i>The wee folk and the grown folk
Who wander to and fro</i>

02:11:47.442 --> 02:11:51.446
<i>Have ways known to their own folk
We throne-folk don't know</i>

02:11:51.947 --> 02:11:54.783
<i>When all the doldrums begin</i>

02:11:56.159 --> 02:11:58.954
<i>What keeps each of them in his skin?</i>

02:12:00.414 --> 02:12:04.042
<i>What ancient native custom
Provides the needed glow?</i>

02:12:04.585 --> 02:12:05.627
<i>Oh, what</i>

02:12:06.628 --> 02:12:09.965
<i>Do simple folk do?</i>

02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:12.634
Do you know?

02:12:15.137 --> 02:12:16.847
<i>Once along the road</i>

02:12:17.014 --> 02:12:19.141
<i>I came upon a lad</i>

02:12:19.683 --> 02:12:22.978
<i>Singing in a voice
Three times his size</i>

02:12:23.979 --> 02:12:27.649
<i>And when I asked him why
He told me he was sad</i>

02:12:28.108 --> 02:12:31.653
<i>And singing always made his spirits rise</i>

02:12:32.321 --> 02:12:33.488
<i>So that's</i>

02:12:34.197 --> 02:12:37.659
<i>What simple folk do</i>

02:12:39.536 --> 02:12:40.996
<i>I surmise</i>

02:12:42.748 --> 02:12:46.960
<i>Arise, my love, arise my love
Apollo's lighting the skies, my love</i>

02:12:47.169 --> 02:12:50.213
<i>The meadows shine with columbine
And daffodils blossom away</i>

02:12:50.714 --> 02:12:54.384
<i>Hear Venus call to one and all
Come taste delight while you may</i>

02:12:54.593 --> 02:12:58.180
<i>The world is bright, and all is right
And life is merry and gay</i>

02:12:59.973 --> 02:13:04.394
<i>The world is bright, and all is right
And life is merry and gay</i>

02:13:07.689 --> 02:13:10.859
<i>What else do the simple folk do?</i>

02:13:12.319 --> 02:13:15.322
<i>They must have a system or two</i>

02:13:16.657 --> 02:13:20.494
<i>They obviously outshine us
At turning tears to mirth</i>

02:13:20.827 --> 02:13:24.790
<i>Have tricks a royal highness
Is minus from birth</i>

02:13:25.207 --> 02:13:28.168
<i>What, then, I wonder Do they</i>

02:13:29.086 --> 02:13:32.506
<i>To chase all the goblins away?</i>

02:13:33.382 --> 02:13:37.219
<i>They have some tribal sorcery
You haven't mentioned yet</i>

02:13:37.511 --> 02:13:39.304
<i>Oh, what</i>

02:13:39.513 --> 02:13:42.891
<i>Do simple folk do</i>

02:13:44.059 --> 02:13:45.394
<i>To forget?</i>

02:13:46.728 --> 02:13:50.607
<i>Often, I am told
They dance a fiery dance</i>

02:13:51.066 --> 02:13:53.902
<i>And whirl till they're
Completely uncontrolled</i>

02:13:55.070 --> 02:13:58.740
<i>Soon the mind is blank
And all are in a trance</i>

02:13:59.408 --> 02:14:02.119
<i>A violent trance astounding to behold</i>

02:14:03.078 --> 02:14:04.246
<i>And that's</i>

02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:08.583
<i>What simple folk do</i>

02:14:09.751 --> 02:14:11.086
<i>So I'm told</i>

02:14:11.878 --> 02:14:15.549
- Really?
- I have it on the best authority.

02:16:20.882 --> 02:16:22.300
Stop it!

02:16:22.509 --> 02:16:25.470
For God's sake, stop it!

02:17:14.727 --> 02:17:18.898
<i>Through the clouds gray with years</i>

02:17:19.107 --> 02:17:22.903
<i>Over hills wet with tears</i>

02:17:23.570 --> 02:17:26.448
<i>To a world young and free</i>

02:17:27.490 --> 02:17:31.827
<i>We will fly Follow me</i>

02:17:32.245 --> 02:17:36.082
<i>April green everywhere</i>

02:17:36.540 --> 02:17:40.253
<i>April's song always there</i>

02:17:40.879 --> 02:17:44.424
<i>Come and hear Come and see</i>

02:17:45.342 --> 02:17:47.177
<i>Follow me</i>

02:17:47.385 --> 02:17:50.096
Merlyn's schoolhouse.

02:17:50.305 --> 02:17:52.057
<i>To a tree</i>

02:17:52.264 --> 02:17:55.727
<i>Where our hopes hang high</i>

02:17:56.019 --> 02:18:00.357
<i>To a dream that should never die</i>

02:18:00.898 --> 02:18:03.526
<i>Where our long lost tomorrows</i>

02:18:03.735 --> 02:18:10.157
<i>Still are in the sweet bye and bye</i>

02:18:12.369 --> 02:18:15.956
<i>Time goes by Or do we</i>

02:18:16.539 --> 02:18:19.709
<i>Close your eyes And you'll see</i>

02:18:21.044 --> 02:18:24.630
<i>As we were We can be</i>

02:18:25.215 --> 02:18:29.177
<i>Weep no more Follow me</i>

02:18:29.593 --> 02:18:33.556
<i>Follow me Follow me</i>

02:18:33.889 --> 02:18:35.392
<i>Follow me</i>

02:18:41.064 --> 02:18:42.482
Hello!

02:18:52.242 --> 02:18:53.535
Hello...

02:18:54.369 --> 02:18:56.204
...Wart!

02:19:01.501 --> 02:19:02.919
Hello...

02:19:03.085 --> 02:19:04.254
...Wart.

02:19:34.659 --> 02:19:39.414
What's the best thing
for being sad? You taught me once.

02:19:39.831 --> 02:19:43.376
The best thing for being sad
is to learn something.

02:19:43.959 --> 02:19:45.503
Learn something?

02:19:45.712 --> 02:19:49.632
It's the one thing, Wart,
that never fails.

02:19:50.133 --> 02:19:51.843
You may grow old...

02:19:53.303 --> 02:19:55.138
...and trembling in your arteries.

02:19:55.305 --> 02:19:57.348
You may lie awake at night...

02:19:57.557 --> 02:20:00.643
...listening to the disorder
of your veins.

02:20:01.061 --> 02:20:04.147
You may miss your father,
your mother...

02:20:04.898 --> 02:20:05.940
...your dog...

02:20:07.108 --> 02:20:08.234
...your only love.

02:20:09.694 --> 02:20:11.237
My love.

02:20:11.446 --> 02:20:13.740
There's only one thing for all of it.

02:20:13.948 --> 02:20:15.283
Learn.

02:20:15.742 --> 02:20:17.035
Learn...

02:20:17.243 --> 02:20:19.329
...why the world wags...

02:20:19.537 --> 02:20:22.415
...and what wags it.

02:20:29.047 --> 02:20:32.467
<i>How could I learn if I couldn't think?</i>

02:20:32.675 --> 02:20:37.013
<i>And I couldn't think,
so I couldn't learn.</i>

02:20:37.430 --> 02:20:41.684
<i>Not even to think the thought,
I thought.</i>

02:20:45.271 --> 02:20:48.358
But even the thought,
"I'm not thinking a thought"...

02:20:48.566 --> 02:20:51.152
...is thinking, isn't it?

02:20:51.319 --> 02:20:53.029
Yes.

02:20:54.364 --> 02:20:58.201
And thinking is something you should
get into the habit of making use of...

02:20:58.368 --> 02:20:59.577
...as often as possible.

02:20:59.994 --> 02:21:03.623
Thinking helps in everything.
Everything but love, that is.

02:21:03.832 --> 02:21:05.375
Love is a sort of...

02:21:05.542 --> 02:21:08.878
...seventh day.
So thinking can rest.

02:21:09.921 --> 02:21:13.842
But this is not Sunday,
so look down.

02:21:14.050 --> 02:21:15.969
Look into the water, Wart.

02:21:16.886 --> 02:21:18.513
Tell me what you see.

02:21:18.972 --> 02:21:20.140
Water...

02:21:20.348 --> 02:21:22.517
...fish and us.

02:21:22.725 --> 02:21:23.810
Forget the water.

02:21:24.060 --> 02:21:26.896
Forget us, and think of the fish.

02:21:27.897 --> 02:21:30.024
Think yourself a fish.

02:21:30.650 --> 02:21:32.485
Feel yourself a fish.

02:21:33.069 --> 02:21:36.239
Breathe with your gills.

02:21:37.991 --> 02:21:43.454
Now be a fish.

02:21:52.422 --> 02:21:55.258
Well, how do you like it?

02:21:55.592 --> 02:22:00.263
How big a fish am I? I just saw
a big fish chasing a smaller fish.

02:22:00.763 --> 02:22:03.099
Am I the dinner or the diner?

02:22:03.266 --> 02:22:06.436
Work it out. Think!

02:22:07.103 --> 02:22:09.772
What are you learning as a fish?

02:22:09.939 --> 02:22:14.194
Oh, not very much. Big fish eat
little fish, just like everywhere else.

02:22:14.444 --> 02:22:18.198
Except somehow that doesn't
seem right, does it?

02:22:18.364 --> 02:22:20.033
Ah!

02:22:21.284 --> 02:22:23.786
Why couldn't I be a bird?

02:22:24.120 --> 02:22:26.039
I would really enjoy being....

02:22:27.624 --> 02:22:29.209
What am I?

02:22:29.459 --> 02:22:31.002
You're a hawk!

02:22:31.294 --> 02:22:33.713
Has the hunting season started?

02:22:33.963 --> 02:22:35.965
By George, I believe it has!

02:22:37.133 --> 02:22:38.927
I'm flying higher!

02:22:39.636 --> 02:22:42.805
Look down.
Tell me what you see.

02:22:42.972 --> 02:22:44.682
I see lakes...

02:22:44.933 --> 02:22:46.809
...trees, forests.

02:22:46.976 --> 02:22:48.478
Can you see Camelot?

02:22:48.645 --> 02:22:50.480
Yes, I can.

02:22:50.980 --> 02:22:53.191
Can you see the next county?

02:22:53.399 --> 02:22:56.319
Uh, yes! I can see the middle of it.

02:22:56.486 --> 02:22:59.280
It's Greylock Valley,
but I can't see the edges of it.

02:22:59.656 --> 02:23:01.866
You see the edges
when you're down here?

02:23:02.659 --> 02:23:05.328
Of course I can.
The boundaries are clearly marked.

02:23:05.662 --> 02:23:08.164
Then what do you know as a hawk...

02:23:08.665 --> 02:23:12.460
...that you don't know as Arthur?
Think!

02:23:12.669 --> 02:23:15.672
I'm not thinking.
I'm just gliding!

02:23:19.676 --> 02:23:21.636
Your majesty.

02:23:28.017 --> 02:23:29.560
Are you alone?

02:23:33.856 --> 02:23:35.525
Not now.

02:23:36.192 --> 02:23:40.863
Isn't this rather far from
the palace for you, Mordred?

02:23:42.031 --> 02:23:46.494
I wanted to see this legendary forest
you've told me so much about.

02:23:46.703 --> 02:23:49.080
This is where Merlyn taught you,
is it not?

02:23:50.331 --> 02:23:51.874
Yes.

02:23:52.208 --> 02:23:54.168
Oh, yes, it is.

02:23:55.712 --> 02:23:59.841
There are times when the only
vacation spot in the world...

02:24:00.049 --> 02:24:01.592
...is the past.

02:24:02.719 --> 02:24:07.515
I can't quite remember all that Merlyn
taught me, but I do remember this.

02:24:08.558 --> 02:24:10.643
That happiness is a virtue.

02:24:11.394 --> 02:24:13.229
No one can be...

02:24:13.438 --> 02:24:15.732
...happy and wicked.

02:24:16.399 --> 02:24:18.860
Triumphant, perhaps,
but not happy.

02:24:19.027 --> 02:24:22.697
Now, if I could teach you that...

02:24:23.406 --> 02:24:25.533
...and make you believe it...

02:24:26.743 --> 02:24:29.912
...then at last,
you could be my son.

02:24:34.083 --> 02:24:36.127
Are you happy, Your Majesty?

02:24:37.420 --> 02:24:38.421
Yes.

02:24:38.588 --> 02:24:39.797
Is the queen?

02:24:40.465 --> 02:24:41.674
Yes.

02:24:41.966 --> 02:24:43.593
And Sir Lancelot?

02:24:44.093 --> 02:24:45.595
What are you implying?

02:24:47.263 --> 02:24:49.015
Nothing, Your Majesty.

02:24:50.600 --> 02:24:52.935
Simply that I did not realize...

02:24:53.519 --> 02:24:57.940
...that deception and infidelity
were candidates for the badge of virtue.

02:24:59.108 --> 02:25:01.027
Whom are you accusing?

02:25:02.945 --> 02:25:04.739
And of what crime?

02:25:04.947 --> 02:25:08.284
And with what proof?

02:25:09.786 --> 02:25:11.996
Isn't your civil law marvelous?

02:25:14.123 --> 02:25:16.793
No proof, no crime.

02:25:18.127 --> 02:25:19.337
Ergo:

02:25:19.962 --> 02:25:22.799
Virtue, happiness.

02:25:23.633 --> 02:25:26.761
You want me to be your son.
No more than I.

02:25:27.637 --> 02:25:29.389
Then prove to me I'm wrong.

02:25:29.806 --> 02:25:34.227
Stay in the forest tonight.
Give your son the lesson of this life.

02:25:35.478 --> 02:25:39.482
Show him how virtue can triumph
without the help of...

02:25:39.649 --> 02:25:41.317
...fear?

02:25:44.404 --> 02:25:46.572
Return to the palace...

02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:49.826
...and inform the court...

02:25:49.992 --> 02:25:54.664
...that His Majesty will be hunting
all through the night...

02:25:55.498 --> 02:25:57.500
...and will return...

02:25:58.334 --> 02:26:00.086
...in the midmorning.

02:26:05.925 --> 02:26:07.135
Yes...

02:26:07.635 --> 02:26:09.262
...milord.

02:26:23.401 --> 02:26:24.819
Merlyn.

02:26:26.696 --> 02:26:28.030
Merlyn?

02:26:29.866 --> 02:26:30.908
Where are you?

02:26:58.144 --> 02:26:59.645
Merlyn....

02:27:00.396 --> 02:27:02.148
Merlyn....

02:27:03.399 --> 02:27:04.650
Get to them.

02:27:05.401 --> 02:27:06.861
Warn them.

02:27:08.613 --> 02:27:11.491
Oh, tell them to be wise.

02:27:30.092 --> 02:27:33.804
Milords! Both of you!
Are you drunk or mad?

02:27:35.264 --> 02:27:37.892
Directly under the king's window!

02:27:39.101 --> 02:27:40.520
The king's not there.

02:27:40.811 --> 02:27:43.439
- He's away for the night.
- Where?

02:27:44.273 --> 02:27:47.652
Hunting.
He'll be back at midmorning.

02:28:32.989 --> 02:28:35.575
I must get back to the castle myself.

02:28:39.328 --> 02:28:40.913
I must get back!

02:28:53.676 --> 02:28:55.344
Jenny.

02:29:01.684 --> 02:29:03.519
Jenny, come away with me.

02:29:04.186 --> 02:29:08.524
To Joyous Gard.
Let's have it open and aboveboard.

02:29:08.858 --> 02:29:11.527
I cannot live like this another day.

02:29:12.028 --> 02:29:13.613
And this man we both love...

02:29:13.821 --> 02:29:16.866
...what would you do,
force him to declare war on you?

02:29:17.033 --> 02:29:21.203
Where either you or he or both would
be killed? And hundreds of others?

02:29:27.126 --> 02:29:28.794
I never wanted to love you.

02:29:29.378 --> 02:29:31.255
Your God arranged it.

02:29:32.214 --> 02:29:34.133
Your God must solve it.

02:29:37.219 --> 02:29:41.891
Arthur is my husband. I must stay
with him as long as he wants me.

02:29:52.234 --> 02:29:54.278
Then so be it, Jenny.

02:29:56.906 --> 02:29:59.158
I will...

02:29:59.367 --> 02:30:01.577
...never ask you again.

02:30:04.080 --> 02:30:06.248
Nor shall I come to you again.

02:30:07.249 --> 02:30:08.709
I swear it.

02:30:11.754 --> 02:30:14.423
And I will never come to you again.

02:30:20.763 --> 02:30:23.057
<i>I loved you</i>

02:30:23.599 --> 02:30:27.144
<i>Once in silence</i>

02:30:27.937 --> 02:30:33.651
<i>And misery was all I knew</i>

02:30:34.110 --> 02:30:35.945
<i>Trying so</i>

02:30:36.278 --> 02:30:40.282
<i>To keep my love from showing</i>

02:30:40.449 --> 02:30:44.120
<i>All the while not knowing</i>

02:30:44.286 --> 02:30:48.040
<i>You loved me too</i>

02:30:48.290 --> 02:30:51.460
<i>Yes, loved me</i>

02:30:51.627 --> 02:30:55.297
<i>In lonesome silence</i>

02:30:55.631 --> 02:30:57.967
<i>Your heart</i>

02:30:58.300 --> 02:31:02.304
<i>Filled with dark despair</i>

02:31:02.972 --> 02:31:04.974
<i>Thinking love</i>

02:31:05.141 --> 02:31:08.561
<i>Would flame in you forever</i>

02:31:08.894 --> 02:31:12.148
<i>And I'd never, never</i>

02:31:12.565 --> 02:31:16.235
<i>Know the flame was there</i>

02:31:17.069 --> 02:31:21.991
<i>Then one day we cast away
Our secret longing</i>

02:31:22.241 --> 02:31:28.372
<i>The raging tide we held inside
Would hold no more</i>

02:31:29.915 --> 02:31:32.418
<i>The silence</i>

02:31:32.626 --> 02:31:35.963
<i>At last was broken</i>

02:31:36.589 --> 02:31:39.258
<i>We flung wide</i>

02:31:39.592 --> 02:31:42.970
<i>Our prison door</i>

02:31:43.596 --> 02:31:49.685
<i>Every joyous word of love
Was spoken</i>

02:31:51.103 --> 02:31:54.815
<i>And now there's
Twice as much grief</i>

02:31:55.024 --> 02:31:57.943
<i>Twice the strain for us</i>

02:31:59.278 --> 02:32:04.617
<i>Twice the despair
Twice the pain for us</i>

02:32:06.285 --> 02:32:16.284
<i>As we had known before</i>

02:32:20.466 --> 02:32:22.510
<i>The silence</i>

02:32:22.718 --> 02:32:25.429
<i>At last was broken</i>

02:32:26.388 --> 02:32:31.894
<i>We flung wide Our prison door</i>

02:32:32.645 --> 02:32:38.400
<i>Every joyous word of love
Was spoken</i>

02:32:39.318 --> 02:32:42.988
<i>And after all had been said</i>

02:32:43.322 --> 02:32:45.991
<i>Here we are, my love</i>

02:32:46.826 --> 02:32:49.286
<i>Silent once more</i>

02:32:49.662 --> 02:32:52.081
<i>And not far....</i>

02:32:52.706 --> 02:32:54.208
My love!

02:32:55.501 --> 02:33:03.926
<i>From where we were before</i>

02:33:26.448 --> 02:33:28.951
Don't reach for your dagger, Lancelot.

02:33:31.829 --> 02:33:34.832
I accuse you of treason and order
you both to stand trial...

02:33:35.040 --> 02:33:36.417
...for your crime.

02:33:37.418 --> 02:33:39.086
Surrender in the name of the king.

02:34:09.742 --> 02:34:11.577
Take him! Take him!

02:34:11.785 --> 02:34:13.370
You cowards!

02:34:34.350 --> 02:34:36.518
Guard! That man!

02:35:35.077 --> 02:35:36.662
Lance!

02:35:45.212 --> 02:35:47.256
Oh, no!

02:36:29.506 --> 02:36:33.469
<i>Guenevere, Guenevere</i>

02:36:33.677 --> 02:36:37.681
<i>Oh they found Guenevere</i>

02:36:38.182 --> 02:36:42.352
<i>In the dying candle's gleam</i>

02:36:42.519 --> 02:36:46.774
<i>Came the sundown Of a dream</i>

02:36:46.940 --> 02:36:50.944
<i>On a day dark and drear</i>

02:36:51.153 --> 02:36:55.491
<i>Came to trial Guenevere</i>

02:36:55.657 --> 02:36:59.703
<i>Ruled the jury For her shame</i>

02:36:59.953 --> 02:37:04.291
<i>She be sentenced To the flame</i>

02:37:06.376 --> 02:37:07.795
Verdict:

02:37:08.545 --> 02:37:12.716
Guilty of treason
against king and country.

02:37:14.009 --> 02:37:15.052
Sentence:

02:37:15.886 --> 02:37:19.723
To be burned
at the stake until death!

02:37:20.891 --> 02:37:25.062
<i>Guenevere, Guenevere</i>

02:37:25.229 --> 02:37:28.816
<i>Lance will save Guenevere</i>

02:37:29.566 --> 02:37:33.612
<i>Any moment he'll appear</i>

02:37:34.071 --> 02:37:38.158
<i>And he'll rescue Guenevere</i>

02:37:38.575 --> 02:37:42.496
<i>Five a.m., oh, it's near</i>

02:37:42.788 --> 02:37:46.583
<i>Not a sound do I hear</i>

02:37:47.167 --> 02:37:51.380
<i>And the bells
Will soon ring clear</i>

02:37:51.755 --> 02:37:56.718
<i>Won't he rescue Guenevere?</i>

02:37:57.094 --> 02:38:01.098
<i>Oh hurry, Lancelot, hurry
There isn't too much time</i>

02:38:01.431 --> 02:38:05.519
<i>Oh hurry, or soon those evil bells
In the tower will chime</i>

02:38:05.811 --> 02:38:09.398
<i>Oh hurry, the guard will soon
Be gathering around the stake</i>

02:38:09.565 --> 02:38:13.652
<i>And soon they will come
To take Guenevere</i>

02:38:13.902 --> 02:38:18.198
<i>Guenevere, Guenevere</i>

02:38:18.365 --> 02:38:22.494
<i>Cannot save Guenevere</i>

02:38:22.703 --> 02:38:26.957
<i>As this fighting time is near</i>

02:38:27.124 --> 02:38:31.378
<i>And the dust blew Guenevere</i>

02:38:31.587 --> 02:38:35.757
<i>Who will save Guenevere?</i>

02:38:35.924 --> 02:38:42.598
<i>Who will save Guenevere?</i>

02:39:23.013 --> 02:39:24.514
Where is the King?

02:39:25.557 --> 02:39:27.559
He's supposed
to watch the execution.

02:39:27.768 --> 02:39:31.688
He's supposed to be here,
at this window. It's the law, isn't it?

02:39:32.439 --> 02:39:36.360
Do you think for one moment
Lancelot will not rescue her?

02:39:36.860 --> 02:39:38.362
But if he tries...

02:39:41.531 --> 02:39:44.993
...that means that Arthur
will have to fight him, won't he?

02:40:19.444 --> 02:40:21.738
Is there no rescue in sight?

02:40:21.947 --> 02:40:23.573
No, not yet, sir.

02:40:24.491 --> 02:40:28.787
Your Majesty, why not ignore
the verdict and pardon her?

02:40:29.371 --> 02:40:31.832
But you can't do that, can you?

02:40:33.333 --> 02:40:35.210
Let her die, your life is over.

02:40:36.169 --> 02:40:38.088
Let her live, your life's a fraud.

02:40:38.297 --> 02:40:40.173
Kill the queen or kill the law.

02:40:49.599 --> 02:40:50.976
Wart!

02:40:52.978 --> 02:40:54.730
I'm afraid...

02:40:54.938 --> 02:40:58.400
...you must come to the window.

02:41:22.591 --> 02:41:26.595
The executioner is waiting...

02:41:26.762 --> 02:41:29.056
...for your signal.

02:41:54.706 --> 02:41:56.458
- Is it Lancelot?
- I don't know.

02:42:10.889 --> 02:42:11.932
Is it, Pelly?

02:42:12.599 --> 02:42:13.642
It is!

02:42:14.559 --> 02:42:16.019
It is!

02:42:16.311 --> 02:42:18.146
Wart, my dear fellow...

02:42:19.481 --> 02:42:20.524
...it is!

02:42:37.916 --> 02:42:40.001
Sweet heaven, what a sight!

02:42:40.877 --> 02:42:42.671
Can you see it from there, Arthur?

02:42:43.088 --> 02:42:46.550
Can you see your goodly Lancelot
murdering your goodly knights?

02:43:31.136 --> 02:43:32.387
Sire...

02:43:33.054 --> 02:43:34.639
...most of the guard...

02:43:36.433 --> 02:43:37.476
...is killed.

02:43:37.684 --> 02:43:38.935
And over 80 knights.

02:43:39.561 --> 02:43:43.773
They must be heading for the channel.
We'll make ready the army to follow.

02:43:43.982 --> 02:43:46.860
We want revenge!
Revenge!

02:43:48.445 --> 02:43:50.989
Your table has cracked, Arthur.

02:43:52.157 --> 02:43:54.951
Shall I save the timbers
for her next stake?

02:44:06.713 --> 02:44:08.131
Merlyn...

02:44:10.008 --> 02:44:12.344
...make me a hawk.

02:44:12.552 --> 02:44:17.599
Let me fly away from here.

02:45:49.983 --> 02:45:51.651
Arthur....

02:45:52.611 --> 02:45:54.863
We want to return with you.

02:45:56.114 --> 02:45:58.491
Let us pay for what we've done.

02:45:58.950 --> 02:46:00.327
At the stake?

02:46:03.371 --> 02:46:04.623
No.

02:46:04.789 --> 02:46:08.835
For what end? Justice?
They've forgotten justice.

02:46:09.044 --> 02:46:11.963
They want revenge.

02:46:12.505 --> 02:46:13.798
Revenge...

02:46:14.049 --> 02:46:16.718
...the most worthless of causes.

02:46:20.305 --> 02:46:21.723
It's too late.

02:46:23.308 --> 02:46:24.601
The Table is dead.

02:46:25.810 --> 02:46:27.729
It exists no more.

02:46:29.606 --> 02:46:33.318
Half my knights
were killed in the yard.

02:46:33.526 --> 02:46:35.904
Mordred is organizing
an army against me.

02:46:36.112 --> 02:46:39.658
The rest of the knights
are in their tents...

02:46:39.866 --> 02:46:42.410
...itching for dawn, cheerful.

02:46:42.577 --> 02:46:44.371
Cheerful to be at war.

02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:48.833
It's those old uncivilized days...

02:46:49.167 --> 02:46:50.502
...come back again.

02:46:51.419 --> 02:46:53.004
Those days...

02:46:55.548 --> 02:46:57.842
...those dreadful days that we tried...

02:46:58.468 --> 02:47:00.679
...to put asleep forever.

02:47:02.639 --> 02:47:06.017
It is your wish
that this dread battle go on?

02:47:06.685 --> 02:47:08.770
It is not my wish!

02:47:09.354 --> 02:47:13.358
I can think no longer of what to do
except to ride the tide of events.

02:47:13.608 --> 02:47:15.235
Oh, what folly!

02:47:15.819 --> 02:47:17.696
All we've been through...

02:47:17.904 --> 02:47:19.531
...for nothing except an idea.

02:47:19.948 --> 02:47:23.159
Something that you cannot taste...

02:47:23.535 --> 02:47:25.662
...or touch, smell...

02:47:26.037 --> 02:47:27.288
...or feel.

02:47:27.789 --> 02:47:29.124
Without...

02:47:29.833 --> 02:47:32.043
...substance, without life...

02:47:32.252 --> 02:47:33.920
...reality...

02:47:34.879 --> 02:47:36.005
...memory.

02:47:46.725 --> 02:47:48.727
The charade will soon begin.

02:47:51.563 --> 02:47:55.650
Please, please.
Please go back to Joyous Gard.

02:47:56.484 --> 02:47:59.779
Jenny is not at Joyous Gard, Arthur.

02:48:00.113 --> 02:48:02.323
She is with the Holy Sisters.

02:48:39.402 --> 02:48:41.070
Is there nothing to be done?

02:48:41.279 --> 02:48:43.281
There's nothing to be done...

02:48:44.199 --> 02:48:46.159
...but to play out the game...

02:48:46.367 --> 02:48:49.078
...and leave the decisions to God.

02:48:52.373 --> 02:48:53.750
Go now, Lance.

02:49:22.403 --> 02:49:24.239
You must go too, Jenny.

02:49:26.241 --> 02:49:27.575
I know.

02:49:32.580 --> 02:49:34.457
So often, in the past...

02:49:34.666 --> 02:49:38.878
...I would look in your eyes
and I would find there forgiveness.

02:49:39.254 --> 02:49:42.173
Perhaps one day, in the future...

02:49:42.382 --> 02:49:44.384
...it shall be there again.

02:49:44.926 --> 02:49:48.930
But I won't be with you.
I won't see it.

02:50:13.997 --> 02:50:15.790
Goodbye...

02:50:15.999 --> 02:50:17.917
...my love.

02:50:44.819 --> 02:50:48.990
My dearest love.

02:51:04.172 --> 02:51:05.590
Who's there?

02:51:07.675 --> 02:51:08.843
Who's there?

02:51:09.719 --> 02:51:11.179
Come out, I say!

02:51:13.765 --> 02:51:14.849
Uh--

02:51:17.018 --> 02:51:18.645
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

02:51:18.853 --> 02:51:21.689
I was searching for
the sergeant of arms and got lost.

02:51:22.023 --> 02:51:24.025
I did not wish to disturb you.

02:51:26.611 --> 02:51:29.364
Who are you?
Where did you come from?

02:51:30.198 --> 02:51:31.824
You ought to be in bed.

02:51:32.200 --> 02:51:33.534
Are you a page?

02:51:34.202 --> 02:51:37.205
I stowed away on one
of the boats, Your Majesty.

02:51:37.664 --> 02:51:39.874
I came to fight for the Round Table.

02:51:40.083 --> 02:51:42.210
I'm very good with a bow.

02:51:42.877 --> 02:51:46.339
And do you intend to kill people
with this bow of yours?

02:51:47.048 --> 02:51:50.218
Oh, yes, milord!
A great many, I hope!

02:51:50.718 --> 02:51:53.221
But supposing that they...

02:51:53.429 --> 02:51:55.098
...killed you?

02:51:55.306 --> 02:51:57.308
Then I shall be dead, milord.

02:51:57.517 --> 02:52:00.853
But I don't intend to be dead.
I intend to be a knight!

02:52:06.067 --> 02:52:07.276
A knight?

02:52:07.652 --> 02:52:10.571
Yes, milord.
Of the Round Table.

02:52:10.905 --> 02:52:14.409
And when did you decide
upon this extinct profession?

02:52:15.284 --> 02:52:17.245
Was your village
once protected by knights?

02:52:17.537 --> 02:52:21.749
Did your father serve a knight?
Was your mother once saved by a knight?

02:52:22.083 --> 02:52:26.295
Oh, no, milord! I'd never even
seen a knight until I stowed away.

02:52:26.504 --> 02:52:27.797
I only know of them...

02:52:28.089 --> 02:52:30.091
...the stories people tell!

02:52:43.438 --> 02:52:45.940
From the stories people tell...

02:52:47.275 --> 02:52:50.111
...you wish to become...

02:52:50.319 --> 02:52:51.529
...a knight?

02:52:54.073 --> 02:52:58.286
Now tell me, what do you think you know
of the Knights of the Round Table?

02:52:58.786 --> 02:53:01.247
I know everything, milord.

02:53:01.456 --> 02:53:02.749
Might for right!

02:53:03.416 --> 02:53:05.126
Right for right!

02:53:05.293 --> 02:53:07.128
Justice for all!

02:53:07.795 --> 02:53:11.340
A Round Table
where all knights would sit.

02:53:12.050 --> 02:53:13.092
Everything!

02:53:21.142 --> 02:53:22.560
Come here.

02:53:24.228 --> 02:53:27.065
- What's your name?
- It is Tom, milord.

02:53:27.482 --> 02:53:30.151
- Where do you come from?
- From Warwick, milord.

02:53:30.359 --> 02:53:33.780
Now listen to me, Tom of Warwick.

02:53:33.988 --> 02:53:36.157
You will not fight in the battle,
understand?

02:53:36.532 --> 02:53:37.658
Yes, milord.

02:53:37.825 --> 02:53:41.496
You will run behind the lines
and hide until it is over.

02:53:42.330 --> 02:53:44.332
And then you will return home...

02:53:44.499 --> 02:53:45.917
...to England...

02:53:47.460 --> 02:53:48.669
...alive.

02:53:50.254 --> 02:53:51.964
To grow up...

02:53:52.507 --> 02:53:54.258
...and grow old.

02:53:55.009 --> 02:53:56.177
Do you understand?

02:53:59.347 --> 02:54:00.848
You will remember...

02:54:01.015 --> 02:54:03.351
...what I, the king, tell you...

02:54:07.021 --> 02:54:10.024
...and do as I command.

02:54:11.526 --> 02:54:13.194
<i>Each evening</i>

02:54:13.694 --> 02:54:16.697
<i>From December to December</i>

02:54:18.533 --> 02:54:22.745
<i>Before you drift to sleep
Upon your cot</i>

02:54:24.038 --> 02:54:29.377
<i>Think back on all the tales
That you remember</i>

02:54:30.211 --> 02:54:32.088
<i>Of Camelot</i>

02:54:35.049 --> 02:54:38.553
<i>Ask every person
If he's heard the story</i>

02:54:40.221 --> 02:54:43.891
<i>And tell it strong and clear
If he has not</i>

02:54:45.059 --> 02:54:50.565
<i>That once there was
A fleeting wisp of glory</i>

02:54:51.065 --> 02:54:52.567
<i>Called Camelot</i>

02:54:56.404 --> 02:54:57.780
<i>Camelot</i>

02:54:58.573 --> 02:54:59.907
<i>Camelot!</i>

02:55:00.074 --> 02:55:03.411
<i>Now say it out With love and joy</i>

02:55:05.663 --> 02:55:07.081
<i>Camelot!</i>

02:55:07.999 --> 02:55:09.250
<i>Camelot!</i>

02:55:09.458 --> 02:55:11.586
Yes, Camelot...

02:55:11.752 --> 02:55:13.087
...my boy.

02:55:16.090 --> 02:55:18.634
<i>Where once it never rained</i>

02:55:18.801 --> 02:55:20.761
<i>Till after sundown</i>

02:55:22.555 --> 02:55:27.018
<i>By 8 a.m.
The morning fog had flown</i>

02:55:28.769 --> 02:55:31.272
<i>Don't let it be forgot</i>

02:55:32.106 --> 02:55:35.109
<i>That once there was a spot</i>

02:55:35.776 --> 02:55:40.364
<i>For one brief shining moment</i>

02:55:40.781 --> 02:55:44.785
<i>That was known as</i>

02:55:47.413 --> 02:55:48.956
<i>Camelot!</i>

02:55:54.795 --> 02:55:56.422
Your Majesty.

02:55:57.715 --> 02:55:59.133
Give me that sword.

02:56:00.301 --> 02:56:02.803
Kneel, Tom. Kneel.

02:56:05.431 --> 02:56:07.892
With this sword, Excalibur...

02:56:08.684 --> 02:56:11.312
...I knight you Sir Tom of Warwick.

02:56:12.271 --> 02:56:14.398
<i>Camelot</i>

02:56:14.815 --> 02:56:16.484
And I command you...

02:56:16.692 --> 02:56:18.319
...to return home...

02:56:18.653 --> 02:56:21.155
...and carry out my orders.

02:56:21.906 --> 02:56:23.491
Yes, milord!

02:56:23.658 --> 02:56:26.202
Arthur, what are you doing?
You have a battle to fight.

02:56:26.452 --> 02:56:28.621
I have won my battle, Pelly.

02:56:30.039 --> 02:56:31.290
And here...

02:56:31.499 --> 02:56:32.667
...is my victory.

02:56:32.833 --> 02:56:35.670
What we did will be remembered.
You'll see.

02:56:37.004 --> 02:56:38.923
Now run, Sir Tom.

02:56:39.882 --> 02:56:42.301
Behind the lines!

02:56:53.896 --> 02:56:56.232
Arthur. Who was that?

02:56:56.440 --> 02:56:58.859
One of what we all are, Pelly.

02:56:59.485 --> 02:57:04.240
Less than a drop in the great blue
motion of the sunlit sea.

02:57:04.824 --> 02:57:08.202
But it seems that some
of the drops sparkle!

02:57:08.536 --> 02:57:11.872
Some of them do sparkle!

02:57:12.707 --> 02:57:15.209
Run, boy!

02:57:15.459 --> 02:57:19.547
Run, boy!

02:57:19.714 --> 02:57:24.218
Run!

02:57:26.637 --> 02:57:29.015
Oh, run...

02:57:29.223 --> 02:57:30.391
...my boy!

02:57:30.558 --> 02:57:33.477
<i>Where once it never rained</i>

02:57:33.644 --> 02:57:35.730
