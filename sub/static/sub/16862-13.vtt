00:00.640 --> 00:02.469
Previously on rescue me...

00:02.500 --> 00:04.070
This is gonna sound so screwed up...

00:04.110 --> 00:05.870
I saw a guy making a save.

00:05.910 --> 00:07.680
It was all smokey and everything, but

00:07.710 --> 00:09.520
I caught the name on the jacket.

00:09.550 --> 00:11.370
Jimmy goddamn keefe.

00:11.400 --> 00:12.840
I want a divorce.

00:12.870 --> 00:15.370
Things have gotta change around here, or I want a divorce, ok?

00:15.410 --> 00:16.970
You want a divorce?

00:17.420 --> 00:18.950
I'll give you a divorce.

00:18.980 --> 00:20.940
You're sleeping with your new boss,

00:20.980 --> 00:21.870
and you don't want me coming around

00:21.900 --> 00:24.340
beuse you don't want him comparing himself to-

00:24.390 --> 00:25.740
- Hey.
- Hi.

00:25.770 --> 00:29.450
Uh, bob, this is my ex, tommy gavin.

00:29.480 --> 00:30.650
Tommy.
How you doin'?

00:30.690 --> 00:32.439
What are you-whoa, whoa, come on!

00:32.470 --> 00:35.840
My daughter's credit card, ok, and throw down $5,000?

00:35.870 --> 00:38.540
You are not going to marry my daughter, you understand?

00:39.260 --> 00:40.530
I'm not going to marry your daughter.

00:40.560 --> 00:41.730
What are you talking about?

00:41.760 --> 00:43.360
- Listen!
- Wait, wait...

00:43.400 --> 00:44.770
- what?
- I got her-

00:44.800 --> 00:46.650
I bought the ring for janelle here.

00:46.680 --> 00:48.210
That's awesome.

00:48.690 --> 00:50.030
I have to go away, just for a week or so.

00:50.060 --> 00:52.150
I've got some interviews lined up in chicago.

00:52.180 --> 00:53.960
Can you look after richie for me?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.200
Richie loves you.

00:55.230 --> 00:57.130
I know he doesn't feel comfortable with anybody else.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.630
Yeah, well, then he can stay at the center.

00:58.650 --> 01:01.570
I would, but he's been talking about wanting to marry that barbara girl,

01:01.610 --> 01:02.690
the one in the wheelchair.

01:02.710 --> 01:04.140
I'm worried that they're gonna run off together.

01:04.170 --> 01:05.660
12 years of catholic school

01:05.690 --> 01:08.820
and you can't remember the shortest prayer they wrote.

01:11.360 --> 01:12.650
All right.

01:13.030 --> 01:14.170
I'm gonna go get her number.

01:14.200 --> 01:15.530
We need to have a little chat.

01:15.560 --> 01:18.470
No, we need to chow down and get it on.

01:18.490 --> 01:20.350
I'm having some trouble with this, latrina.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.020
Hey, if you can't, you can'T.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.890
- Well, what are you doing?
- Cleaning up this mess.

01:23.930 --> 01:25.350
Well, wait a minute!
Don't do that!

01:25.380 --> 01:28.330
I don't throw it away, what you gonna do for me?

01:32.050 --> 01:35.190
After we've done it about 10, 12 times,

01:35.230 --> 01:36.900
you know, after that initial...

01:36.920 --> 01:38.720
I'll just get a little bored.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.000
So...

01:40.030 --> 01:42.250
you're basically sayin s that

01:42.300 --> 01:44.960
this relationship is kind of doomed?

01:46.280 --> 01:47.760
Well, aren't they all?

01:51.960 --> 01:54.270
Hey, give me a whiskey...

01:54.310 --> 01:55.740
that big.

You want another soda?

02:55.930 --> 02:57.940
No, no, no, I'm good. M good.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.600
So, what about the ball game?

03:01.010 --> 03:02.230
TheAll game?

03:02.250 --> 03:04.380
Yeah, I wanna go to a ball game.

03:04.410 --> 03:06.380
Me and you, teddy.

03:06.990 --> 03:08.530
A yankees game?

03:08.560 --> 03:09.830
Yankees?

03:09.870 --> 03:12.080
I want to see a minor league team,

03:12.100 --> 03:13.310
single "a" ball.

03:13.330 --> 03:16.020
You want to go to a minor league baseball game?

03:16.050 --> 03:18.220
They got a whole amusement park

03:18.250 --> 03:20.800
- right outside the outfield wall.
- Yeah, I know.

03:20.830 --> 03:22.730
- With a rollercoaster.
- I know.

03:22.760 --> 03:26.460
So you want to go to a minor league ballgame?

03:26.490 --> 03:27.260
Yep.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.800
All right, I'll get tickets to a minor league game, all right?

03:30.830 --> 03:33.780
How's the not drinking thing going?

03:33.800 --> 03:35.920
It's going fine.
Good.

03:35.950 --> 03:38.430
- You?
- Horrible.

03:38.460 --> 03:42.640
All I think about is booze and drugs.

03:42.670 --> 03:44.040
Well, maybe if you weren't hanging arnd

03:44.070 --> 03:45.850
in a place all day that's full of both of them,

03:45.890 --> 03:47.020
you'd be better off.

03:47.050 --> 03:48.720
You know what they say,

03:48.750 --> 03:50.450
keep your friends close-

03:50.490 --> 03:52.750
Keep your enemies closer.
Yeah.

03:52.780 --> 03:54.350
All right.

04:37.550 --> 04:45.890
I pray that I may live each day as though it were my last.

04:47.940 --> 04:55.790
I pray that I may live my life as though it were everlasting.

04:55.820 --> 04:57.480
Even though it ain'T.

05:02.280 --> 05:03.470
Hey.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.690
Hey!

05:26.120 --> 05:27.900
Hello?

05:33.250 --> 05:34.610
Hey.

Firefighter Awarded FDNY's Top
Honor For Heroic Rescue

06:00.260 --> 06:02.380
Oh, jesus christ!

06:56.100 --> 06:58.780
yes in the back, yes.

06:58.800 --> 07:01.060
I'm derek. I'm an alcoholic and a drug addict.

07:01.110 --> 07:02.550
Hi, derek.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.300
I screwed up at work last night.

07:04.330 --> 07:07.340
22 years I'm working this goddamn program.

07:07.370 --> 07:10.410
2 decades I walk past bags of coke,

07:10.450 --> 07:14.030
half-smoked joints, full glasses of chilled vodka.

07:14.060 --> 07:17.040
I work in a nightclub, every goddamn night for years.

07:17.070 --> 07:20.370
and last night some chick drops a bag of blow on the bar.

07:20.400 --> 07:21.520
Instead of saying something,

07:21.560 --> 07:24.460
I pick up the bag of coke and I grab a drink off the bar,

07:24.500 --> 07:27.060
someone's double vodka, and I slam it.

07:27.090 --> 07:29.260
I grab another drink,

07:29.690 --> 07:32.950
go into the bathroom, and shove the whole bag up my nose.

07:33.410 --> 07:36.080
The next think you know, I'm banging this girl.

07:36.770 --> 07:38.090
She had an ass.

07:38.120 --> 07:40.840
God, you had to see this girl's ass, it was perfect.

07:40.870 --> 07:42.790
It was a michelle pfeiffer,

07:42.830 --> 07:45.370
jennifer lopez combo platter ass.

07:45.400 --> 07:46.790
Nice.

07:47.810 --> 07:51.020
and you know what?
It was great.

07:51.060 --> 07:53.280
It was goddamn spine-bending.

07:53.980 --> 07:56.310
And I felt like I was in control, man.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.810
And the way she was, moving ainst me,

07:58.850 --> 08:01.480
felt like she would have done anything I wanted.

08:01.520 --> 08:04.480
It was the best I felt in a long, long time.

08:04.510 --> 08:06.930
Powerful, engaged.

08:06.970 --> 08:10.120
I was ready to goddamn roll, man. Anywhere.

08:10.160 --> 08:12.030
And then she came.

08:12.230 --> 08:15.370
And that made me feel awesome,

08:15.410 --> 08:18.810
like a master, like the homerun king, you know?

08:18.850 --> 08:21.260
And just when I was about to explode...

08:21.910 --> 08:23.720
I don't know.

08:23.740 --> 08:27.250
I suddenly felt exactly the way I feel right now-

08:28.350 --> 08:29.810
low.

08:29.830 --> 08:31.920
Lower than a snake.

08:32.400 --> 08:35.549
The sex and the booze and the drugs,

08:35.580 --> 08:37.640
it's all just a dead-end.

08:37.659 --> 08:40.409
I want a real goddamned thing, you know?

08:40.440 --> 08:42.830
A girlfriend, a relationship.

08:42.860 --> 08:45.140
I want to feel the way I do about booze.

08:45.170 --> 08:48.650
I want to get that fix from another human being.

08:48.680 --> 08:52.110
Anyway, that was my week.

08:56.610 --> 08:59.260
Hey, guys, I ordered some pizza, it's waiting up in the kitchen.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.810
Mike, do me a favor, I've got to hit the head.

09:01.840 --> 09:03.200
Would you run a slice up to my office?

09:03.230 --> 09:04.480
Yeah, sure thing, chief.

09:06.410 --> 09:09.400
You know, I love a false alarm as much as any other firemen.

09:09.430 --> 09:11.410
No dead kids, no burnt up grandmas,

09:11.440 --> 09:14.360
no playing peek-a-boo through the smoke for lost family pets,

09:14.400 --> 09:16.110
but I really gotta be honest with you.

09:16.140 --> 09:19.960
I was kind of praying to the god of all pizzas thate'd have a really ripping fire

09:19.990 --> 09:21.520
so that we could get another,

09:21.560 --> 09:24.680
you know, jimmy keefe ghost sighting.

09:30.980 --> 09:34.870
Um, I guess I'll just put it on his desk, right?

09:44.920 --> 09:47.740
Yeah, you know, guys, I've heard the rumors, you know.

09:47.770 --> 09:49.430
And all I can say is...

09:50.200 --> 09:51.570
I mean, come on.

09:51.590 --> 09:52.800
This is not the sixth sense.

09:52.820 --> 09:54.820
There are no ghosts roaming the halls.

09:54.840 --> 09:57.150
Hey, lou, I saw what I saw.

09:57.190 --> 09:59.420
No, you saw what you think you saw.

09:59.460 --> 10:02.070
And you know, ever since I've been doing doubles with youopes,

10:02.110 --> 10:04.570
I've been watching you put away the booze, ok?

10:04.610 --> 10:06.460
Now I didn't say shit, ok,

10:06.500 --> 10:08.620
because you're still getting the job done, all right?

10:08.660 --> 10:11.370
And whatever it takes to get through the day sane is ok with me.

10:11.410 --> 10:13.630
Now what I need to know now is

10:13.670 --> 10:17.100
who has seen the ghost of jimmy keefe?

10:17.130 --> 10:18.550
So far?

10:18.580 --> 10:20.060
The both of us and larry.

10:20.080 --> 10:21.830
But we've each seen him a couple of times.

10:21.860 --> 10:24.350
Yeah. I just saw him in the bathroom, just last night.

10:24.370 --> 10:25.270
All right, look, you know,

10:25.300 --> 10:28.300
obviously sanity has gone right out the window here, all right?

10:28.330 --> 10:30.520
So I need you guys to collect every bottle of booze

10:30.560 --> 10:32.530
thatyou've stashed away in this house

10:32.580 --> 10:34.260
and pour it down the goddamned drain.

10:34.290 --> 10:36.110
- Do you hear me?
- We did that already.

10:36.140 --> 10:38.650
Nther one of us have had a drop in 3 days.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.130
What?

10:41.160 --> 10:43.740
We just saw jimmy keefe in the hallway outside chief's office.

10:43.770 --> 10:45.560
- See?
- Clear as day.

10:46.130 --> 10:49.000
Said "keefe" right on the jacket.

10:49.030 --> 10:50.960
Ok, well, then...

10:51.380 --> 10:53.630
someone's gonna have to run out,

10:54.010 --> 10:55.450
get us another bottle.

11:29.150 --> 11:31.700
Hey!What the hell's going on here, huh?

11:31.730 --> 11:33.890
I got goddamn pizza all over my shoes.

11:33.910 --> 11:36.070
What kind of a bullshit rookie prank is this, huh?

11:36.100 --> 11:39.680
I buy you guys pizza, this is the way you pay me back?Huh?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.480
Lou, come on in the office, now.

11:41.500 --> 11:43.240
- Chief, wait.
- What?

11:44.940 --> 11:46.440
It wasn't a gag.

11:46.890 --> 11:48.360
What then?

11:48.390 --> 11:50.360
- D't tell him.
- Tell me what?

11:50.370 --> 11:54.090
All right, look, chief, let's go in, ok?
T was all my stupid idea.

11:54.110 --> 11:55.570
It wasn't goddamn funny.
Look at my shoes.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.240
- I'm sorry.
- Wait, wait, chief.

11:57.270 --> 12:00.310
It was a ghost.

12:02.130 --> 12:03.370
What?

12:03.400 --> 12:09.150
There's-we've all been seeing jimmy keefe's ghost.

12:09.170 --> 12:11.560
They've seen him here in the firehouse,

12:11.590 --> 12:14.230
they've seen him on jobs.

12:14.250 --> 12:16.750
Working inside the jobs.

12:17.840 --> 12:19.430
You, uh...

12:19.450 --> 12:21.340
you all have seen him?

12:24.020 --> 12:24.900
Lou?

12:24.920 --> 12:26.630
No, no, not yet.

12:26.650 --> 12:28.270
Although, to be honest with you,

12:28.300 --> 12:30.820
I'm kind of looking forward to, you know, running into him.

12:31.850 --> 12:35.500
You guys ever hear of section 8,

12:35.530 --> 12:37.740
which means you're alnutsl hmm?

12:38.220 --> 12:40.110
Never brought a guy up on a charge like that before,

12:40.150 --> 12:42.190
let alone the whole goddamned crew.

12:42.210 --> 12:45.440
Now there's gotta be an explanation, no such thing as ghosts.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.680
Unless of course I see jimmy keefe,

12:47.720 --> 12:50.220
in which case all off us hop into the suburban,

12:50.260 --> 12:51.420
head down to H.Q.

12:51.450 --> 12:54.290
, And turn ourselves into the psychiatric board.

12:55.290 --> 12:56.790
- Hey, guys.
- Oh!

12:56.820 --> 12:58.840
The pizza's getting cold down here.

13:06.490 --> 13:09.020
That's 6 messages I lef for her today.

13:09.040 --> 13:11.400
How many goddamned job interviews did she have?

13:11.420 --> 13:12.750
None.

13:12.780 --> 13:14.350
What?

13:14.380 --> 13:16.950
There's no job in chicago.

13:17.650 --> 13:19.640
The guy she's been seeing?

13:19.670 --> 13:24.020
The ashton kutcher artist shitbag?

13:24.050 --> 13:26.130
He lives there.

13:26.700 --> 13:28.940
So she's gonna go there for a week

13:28.980 --> 13:31.670
to see if she likes it enough to move.

13:33.040 --> 13:35.870
I told her, "I'm not going to chicago.

13:35.900 --> 13:39.350
I don't care what you say, natalie.

13:39.380 --> 13:41.880
I'm gonna stay here

13:41.900 --> 13:44.160
and marry barbara

13:44.190 --> 13:46.050
and have sex with her.

13:46.760 --> 13:49.470
Right after it's official. "

13:51.550 --> 13:54.050
She lied to you, franco.

13:55.200 --> 13:56.730
I'm sorry.

13:58.990 --> 14:00.230
Me, too.

14:06.840 --> 14:09.870
2 fake baby head t-shirts, that's all I owned here?

14:09.890 --> 14:12.940
And, uh, this.

14:13.660 --> 14:15.600
- Shit.
- Thanks.

14:15.620 --> 14:19.500
Um, I may need this for the gig tomorrow night.

14:19.530 --> 14:21.850
You know, my dad paid for everything else, tony,

14:21.880 --> 14:23.950
including your new girriend's wedding ring.

14:23.980 --> 14:25.400
It's an engagement ring.

14:25.430 --> 14:27.780
- Engagement.
- Whatever.

14:33.110 --> 14:34.870
That...

14:34.910 --> 14:37.150
that ring could have been for you.

14:38.210 --> 14:39.730
What?

14:39.760 --> 14:42.350
I- I want to get hitched.

14:42.370 --> 14:44.620
I dig that whole, you know,

14:44.650 --> 14:47.570
let's tribe up and have kids thing, but

14:47.610 --> 14:49.770
your old man, col,

14:49.800 --> 14:51.740
he scares the shit out of me.

14:52.500 --> 14:56.940
So my dad is the reason we're not getting married?

14:56.980 --> 14:58.410
Yeah.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.750
That and the fact that I met this other chick.

15:00.790 --> 15:01.710
But that would have never happened

15:01.750 --> 15:04.840
if your dad wasn't such a pain in the ass.

15:07.540 --> 15:11.280
Oh, my god, I'm already going through little elvis withdrawal.

15:11.310 --> 15:13.770
Ok, speaking of which, you gotta drop the elvis thing, ok?

15:13.800 --> 15:14.260
Why?

15:14.290 --> 15:15.960
Because janet's calling him something else,

15:16.020 --> 15:17.240
and I'm starting to get confused,

15:17.270 --> 15:18.280
and it's just going to lead to trouble.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.810
Well, why?
What's she calling him?

15:19.840 --> 15:21.460
She's call him wyatt.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.810
- Not my idea, ok?
- Wyatt?

15:23.840 --> 15:26.390
That's so stupid!
What is he, a rodeo clown?

15:26.420 --> 15:27.760
Wyatt, as in wyatt earp,

15:27.800 --> 15:29.060
as in kevin costner's wyatt earp.

15:29.090 --> 15:30.530
You know what a big fan of costner she is.

15:30.550 --> 15:32.310
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

15:32.740 --> 15:34.400
Did you see dancing with wolves?

15:34.440 --> 15:35.550
7 oscars.

15:35.580 --> 15:37.900
Did 3 of the greatest baseball movies ever made, ok?

15:37.920 --> 15:39.420
Field of dreams, classic.

15:39.440 --> 15:41.560
Bull durham, classic. And then-

15:41.590 --> 15:42.660
what the hell's the name of the other one?

15:42.680 --> 15:44.740
But his girlfriend tt was unbelievably hot,

15:44.770 --> 15:47.490
- she was john travolta's wife.
- That's it, ok?

15:47.520 --> 15:49.530
The best movie that kevin costner has ever done-

15:49.570 --> 15:50.660
Oh, I know exactly what you're going to say,

15:50.690 --> 15:52.090
- message in a bottle.
- Waterworld.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.990
- Waterworld?
- What-are you-

15:54.020 --> 15:56.490
He was tan, he was buff, he was delicious.

15:56.520 --> 15:58.090
He did have a vagina in his neck,

15:58.130 --> 15:58.720
but I can take it.

15:58.740 --> 16:00.770
Ok, so jet skis and neck vaginas,

16:00.800 --> 16:02.400
this is your idea of a great kevin costner movie?

16:02.440 --> 16:03.280
You're out of your mind.

16:03.310 --> 16:04.500
You know, just because he looks tan and buff.

16:04.530 --> 16:05.340
Such a chick thing.

16:05.360 --> 16:06.730
Listen, let me just-

16:06.760 --> 16:08.690
in theory,

16:08.720 --> 16:12.020
let's just say that I was gonna give elvis a little earring.

16:12.040 --> 16:13.960
What's the worst that could happen?

16:13.980 --> 16:16.410
Janet wou shilda turkey dinner, ok?

16:16.440 --> 16:18.960
So then we'll wait till right before thanksgiving.

16:20.280 --> 16:22.500
All right, see you later.

16:26.220 --> 16:27.890
Yeah?

16:29.480 --> 16:31.530
Come in.

16:54.630 --> 17:00.150
Storage

17:42.610 --> 17:43.990
Yeah?

17:44.010 --> 17:45.230
Hey.

17:45.250 --> 17:48.280
I'm sensing a little confusion about our situation here,

17:48.310 --> 17:51.490
so I thought it would be helpful if we got everything on the table.

17:51.510 --> 17:53.090
The situation.

17:53.120 --> 17:55.830
Listen, I don't want a husband.

17:55.850 --> 17:57.140
I already had one of those,

17:57.180 --> 17:58.800
and he was a real pain in the ass.

17:58.830 --> 18:00.350
I think, by the end, he was even wearing my underwear.

18:00.380 --> 18:02.790
Oh, he sounds perfect.

18:02.820 --> 18:03.960
I don't know.

18:03.990 --> 18:08.600
I don't know what happened to men and women and good old-fashioned sex.

18:08.630 --> 18:11.250
It's like all this intimacy bullshit

18:11.290 --> 18:14.900
and this talk about our feelings and bitching about our needs

18:14.930 --> 18:16.670
and blah, blahblah, blah, blah.

18:16.700 --> 18:18.920
I'm sorry, it just doesn't work for m Uh-huh.

18:18.950 --> 18:20.320
You're old school.

18:20.350 --> 18:21.330
You want to know the truth,

18:21.360 --> 18:23.950
a little hair pulling and a little ass slapping every now and then...

18:24.070 --> 18:27.950
Ok, you know what, I haven't even had time to think about pulling your hair, ok?

18:27.970 --> 18:30.450
And-and-and as far as spanking goes,

18:30.480 --> 18:32.000
we're months away from spanking,

18:32.040 --> 18:34.320
so I don't know what to tell you.

18:34.350 --> 18:36.350
Listen, all I'm saying is this-

18:36.380 --> 18:37.960
what works for me now

18:38.000 --> 18:41.850
is one guy who will do whatever I want whenever I have the urge.

18:41.870 --> 18:44.960
No whining, no dinner, no seeing other people.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.000
Right.

18:46.030 --> 18:47.680
Well, that's not really going to work for me, though.

18:47.700 --> 18:48.980
I'm a man, I want a woman.

18:49.010 --> 18:51.290
I finally figured i out.
That's what I want, ok?

18:51.320 --> 18:52.760
I want to come home to a woman.

18:52.790 --> 18:53.830
I don't want you to tell me what to do.

18:53.860 --> 18:55.620
I want you to tell me how to make you happy in bed

18:55.660 --> 18:58.120
and what's broken in the house that you need me to fix, ok?

18:58.150 --> 18:59.510
That's my deal, all right?

18:59.540 --> 19:01.680
So good luck with the urges and the no,

19:01.710 --> 19:03.290
you know, whining at all,

19:03.320 --> 19:06.630
and the underweabeing worn by the guy. All right?

19:06.660 --> 19:09.300
I mean, it's been nice knowing you, though.

19:14.970 --> 19:17.110
- Hey.
- He's sound asleep now.

19:22.710 --> 19:24.090
So...

19:25.300 --> 19:27.430
everything's going all right, then?

19:27.440 --> 19:28.540
Yeah.

19:28.570 --> 19:30.650
- Yeah, it's good.
- Yeah?

19:30.670 --> 19:31.960
Yeah.

19:31.990 --> 19:33.950
So everything'S...

19:34.600 --> 19:36.180
- with bob?
- Bob?

19:36.200 --> 19:38.640
- Yeah, it's great.
- Good.

19:38.670 --> 19:39.900
So are you seeing anyone?

19:39.920 --> 19:42.760
No, no, no.
Not now.

19:42.790 --> 19:44.940
Look, we're, um,

19:44.970 --> 19:46.650
bob's coming over for dinner.

19:46.680 --> 19:48.650
Oh, ok.

19:49.410 --> 19:51.510
That would explain the dress, I guess. That'S...

19:52.130 --> 19:53.860
must be going good.

19:53.880 --> 19:55.990
Yeah.
It's good.

19:56.010 --> 19:58.810
- Really?
- Yeah, yeah.

19:58.840 --> 20:02.040
You know, he reads actually the same books that I read.

20:02.060 --> 20:04.000
He actually goes to the opera,

20:04.040 --> 20:05.950
which I didn't know I like.

20:05.990 --> 20:07.680
- Wow.
- Yeah.

20:07.710 --> 20:10.950
He helps around the house and with wyatt.

20:11.410 --> 20:14.630
Let's be honest, I mean, it's always been the kid thing.

20:14.670 --> 20:16.400
Not spending enough time with the kids,

20:16.430 --> 20:19.300
that was always the big problem.

20:19.320 --> 20:21.170
Which is funny now.

20:21.200 --> 20:25.770
I spend half my time driving the kid between you and colleen, so...

20:27.390 --> 20:29.030
It was a bunch of things, but, tommy,

20:29.060 --> 20:31.790
you didn't learn how to change a diaper until-

20:31.840 --> 20:34.920
- Ok, because I was working-
- Until katy was almost 2 years old.

20:34.940 --> 20:37.490
We've been through this.

20:38.140 --> 20:40.280
Ok, you're right.
You're right.

20:40.310 --> 20:41.850
It's going nowhere.

20:42.410 --> 20:44.360
All right.

20:47.930 --> 20:50.000
I- I mean, you know, whatever else you want to say,

20:50.020 --> 20:52.870
I pe that you realize this...

20:52.890 --> 20:56.920
it's just now th I'm starting to understand how much money I make.

20:56.950 --> 20:59.730
Even the stuff I made under the table, I gave to you,

20:59.760 --> 21:00.910
you know, so you could buy

21:00.950 --> 21:02.360
- everything for the kids.
- Tommy, you were always generous.

21:02.380 --> 21:03.670
Right.

21:03.700 --> 21:07.430
What was it, the chinese guy with the designer shoes?

21:07.460 --> 21:09.830
- Jimmy choos.
- Yes.

21:09.850 --> 21:13.100
There are certain things that you carry away from a relationship.

21:13.120 --> 21:16.040
That's one of the things I will never begrudge you.

21:16.060 --> 21:17.900
My jimmy choos?

21:17.920 --> 21:19.970
Yeah, because I'll tell you something...

21:19.990 --> 21:23.090
some of those- just the way that...

21:25.190 --> 21:27.850
they made your ass...

21:29.350 --> 21:32.370
and your legs look.

21:33.800 --> 21:37.260
I mean, if you were wearing a pair of those shoes

21:37.280 --> 21:40.040
with this dress in particular-uh...

22:08.650 --> 22:10.920
I gotta go.

22:23.170 --> 22:26.160
I hear people speak about one night stands...

22:26.180 --> 22:29.140
I used to dream about one night stands,

22:29.160 --> 22:32.620
'cause that implied actually having spent the night with someone.

22:32.640 --> 22:35.330
What I was having was quickies.

22:35.340 --> 22:40.370
In the morning, in the late morning, in the early afternoon.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.680
Mega-ultra quickies.

22:42.710 --> 22:47.880
Like, I'd order breakfast and I'd have sex with the delivery guy.

22:47.900 --> 22:52.450
Or I'd oer up lunch and I'd go down on the delivery guy.

22:52.470 --> 22:53.580
Different restaurants, by the way,

22:53.610 --> 22:56.480
and I never ordered from the same place twice.

22:56.510 --> 22:59.090
Except for the mexican joint.

22:59.120 --> 23:03.330
They had this young delivery guy who looked like erik estrada.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.440
And then over the holidays, forget it.

23:05.460 --> 23:07.730
You know, I went down to the corner to pick out a tree

23:07.760 --> 23:12.630
and they had these really cute young guys who'd deliver them for you.

23:13.110 --> 23:15.850
Needless to say, my living room looked like a goddamned pine forest

23:15.880 --> 23:18.030
bythe time christmas day rolled around.

23:20.570 --> 23:21.930
Maggie.

23:24.310 --> 23:26.910
Maggie, wait, will you listen to me for one second?

23:26.940 --> 23:29.930
You are not an alcoholic.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.040
Oh, no?
Well, 2 nights ago?

23:32.070 --> 23:32.480
Yeah?

23:32.510 --> 23:35.030
Yeah, I went to a bar and I got shitfaced, ok?

23:35.060 --> 23:37.050
And I ended up taking home this woman

23:37.070 --> 23:38.310
who I thought looked like julianne moore,

23:38.340 --> 23:39.960
and I banged her brains out all night, ok?

23:39.980 --> 23:42.090
And I woke up the next day, and you know who she actually looked like?

23:42.120 --> 23:43.220
Tawny kitaen.

23:43.260 --> 23:45.160
No, lucille ball.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.550
Wait a second, tawny kitaen,

23:46.580 --> 23:48.020
she's the girl who used to go out with the guy from whitesnake

23:48.050 --> 23:50.670
and all the music videos she's like on the hot rod and all that lingerie?

23:50.700 --> 23:51.360
Yeah, that's her.

23:51.390 --> 23:54.240
Oh, god, yeah, she's so hot.
I wish.

23:55.430 --> 23:58.810
- Wait, why are you smiling?
- I'm happy for you.

23:58.830 --> 24:00.310
You're happy I slept with lucille ball?

24:00.340 --> 24:03.510
No, I'm happy that you had sex with someone.

24:03.530 --> 24:06.020
I felt so guilty after all these months

24:06.050 --> 24:08.310
of not wanting to sleep with you.

24:08.340 --> 24:11.340
So she wasn't tawny kitaen, big deal, at least

24:11.370 --> 24:13.370
you got laid!

24:13.890 --> 24:14.970
And you know what, sean,

24:15.010 --> 24:16.760
the only reason why you slept with her

24:16.790 --> 24:18.780
was to prove to me that you're a drunk,

24:18.810 --> 24:19.860
which you're not.

24:19.890 --> 24:21.090
Because a real drunk

24:21.130 --> 24:22.520
either wouldn't have remembered doing it

24:22.550 --> 24:24.070
or would have been so ashamed and afraid,

24:24.110 --> 24:26.200
he'd do anything possible

24:26.240 --> 24:29.790
to cover up what he did, including lie through his teeth to his wife

24:29.830 --> 24:31.960
to keep her from finding out.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.680
We are all good.

24:35.460 --> 24:38.660
I love you, I always will.

24:40.050 --> 24:42.440
But it's time to move on.

24:45.580 --> 24:47.010
Bye.

24:50.330 --> 24:54.140
You mean like really move on, or, likejust, a temporary good-bye?

24:58.280 --> 24:59.710
Hey, kid, I want to ask you something.

24:59.730 --> 25:02.210
'Cause, you know, I respect your opinion about shit.

25:02.230 --> 25:03.700
Yeah, sure.

25:03.730 --> 25:06.090
What do you think of latrina?

25:06.770 --> 25:08.640
You mean the, um,

25:08.680 --> 25:12.130
heavyset black woman who's pretty much kind of moved into my apartment?

25:12.160 --> 25:14.280
Yeah, her.
What do you think?

25:14.800 --> 25:16.930
She's ok, I guess.

25:17.390 --> 25:20.680
I don't know, she's been acting funny lately.

25:20.710 --> 25:24.090
I'm starting to get the feeling like she don't like me anymore.

25:27.690 --> 25:31.590
Look, mike, I, uh, did a bad thing.

25:31.620 --> 25:32.700
What, did you piss yourself?

25:32.750 --> 25:33.820
No, no, not yet.

25:33.850 --> 25:35.350
Oh.
No.

25:35.380 --> 25:39.290
But you know how we were supposed to bury the hatchet over the teresa thing?

25:39.740 --> 25:44.150
I didn't really bury it as much as I kind of kicked some dirt over it.

25:44.190 --> 25:46.190
And, you know, being...

25:46.220 --> 25:48.370
The emotional 12-year-old that I am,

25:48.400 --> 25:51.260
I decided rather than to discuss it with you,

25:51.290 --> 25:54.620
iould go and have sex,

25:54.660 --> 25:58.930
revenge sex, with latrina.

26:01.090 --> 26:02.720
Oh.

26:06.670 --> 26:09.070
But I thought you don't even like black chicks.

26:09.090 --> 26:10.640
- I made an exception.
- Yeah.

26:10.660 --> 26:13.120
And I thought you liked them a lot slimmer than latrina.

26:13.160 --> 26:15.070
I was really, really angry.

26:17.480 --> 26:19.110
Ok.

26:19.990 --> 26:23.400
Hey, pal, 2 more here.
2 more.

26:24.040 --> 26:26.400
Wait a minute, that's it?
You're not angry?

26:26.440 --> 26:28.410
You're not gonna throw a punch?

26:28.440 --> 26:32.000
Hey, it had to happen sooner or later.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.410
It's all right.

26:41.110 --> 26:43.460
Wait a minute.

26:43.770 --> 26:44.980
You...

26:45.010 --> 26:47.890
you asked latrina out because

26:47.930 --> 26:52.230
you knew I was gonna hit on your first girlfriend.

26:52.250 --> 26:54.470
This one's for you, pal.

26:54.490 --> 26:57.370
Devious 362 pound bitch that you are.

26:57.400 --> 27:00.080
Sorry, calista flockhart.

27:00.110 --> 27:01.460
So she finally got to you, huh?

27:01.490 --> 27:03.450
What was it, the old bedonka-donk?

27:03.470 --> 27:05.890
No, it was the triangle ravioli

27:05.920 --> 27:07.980
and the goddamn chocolate pizza.

27:08.500 --> 27:10.120
Xcuse me?

27:10.140 --> 27:12.220
Well, she seduced me with that chocolate pizza.

27:12.250 --> 27:14.390
One bite, I was putty in her hands.

27:14.410 --> 27:15.510
I saw the face of god.

27:15.530 --> 27:17.510
Boy, you think you know somebody!

27:17.540 --> 27:19.220
That lying bitch!

27:19.250 --> 27:20.690
That's a shame.

27:20.720 --> 27:22.680
You should have tasted that pizza.

27:37.720 --> 27:40.880
I talked to lori cunningham at rite-aid,

27:40.920 --> 27:42.460
she told me everything!

27:42.490 --> 27:44.860
She told me how the other crew's been seeing him on the rig,

27:44.890 --> 27:46.870
how he pulled someone out of a fire!

27:46.890 --> 27:49.090
- Stop, stop, stop!
- No!

27:49.120 --> 27:50.590
Get off me!

27:50.630 --> 27:52.620
Stop!
You goddamned liar!

27:52.640 --> 27:53.690
You're a goddamned liar!

27:53.720 --> 27:55.980
Why didn't you tell me?
Why didn't you tell me?

27:56.010 --> 27:58.400
I knew this was going to happen. Now stop.

27:58.420 --> 28:00.790
Ok?
Will you stop swinging?

28:00.820 --> 28:06.350
Ever-everybody's been seeing him!

28:06.380 --> 28:08.760
Hey, shh!

28:08.790 --> 28:10.340
Ok?

28:12.810 --> 28:13.860
The guy's shitfaced.

28:13.890 --> 28:14.970
The whole crew's been shitfaced.

28:15.000 --> 28:18.530
They've been seeing his name on the back of I don't know whs coat.

28:18.550 --> 28:19.560
It's bullshit.

28:19.610 --> 28:21.570
There's no one else in this house with that last name.

28:21.600 --> 28:24.400
There's no one else in a house and not from manhattan wh that name,

28:24.435 --> 28:26.480
and all of his things disintegrated!

28:26.520 --> 28:30.470
I don't even have any of his damn things!

28:31.030 --> 28:33.410
Ok, ok.
Have you seen him again?

28:33.440 --> 28:35.270
Have you seen him again?

28:36.260 --> 28:37.370
No, I haven't seen him again.

28:37.390 --> 28:39.370
I'm telling you, these guys are shitfaced.

28:39.390 --> 28:42.210
Ok?This is why- I knew this was gonna happen.

28:42.230 --> 28:43.550
You know?

28:44.160 --> 28:45.550
What?

28:47.460 --> 28:48.930
You need to be on medication.

28:48.950 --> 28:51.120
I'm telling you.
This is why I didn't tell you, ok?

28:51.150 --> 28:52.710
I just want to know one thing.

28:52.740 --> 28:55.950
- Is it because I'm a bad person?
- You're not a bad person.

28:55.990 --> 28:59.920
Because I know I've done stuff, I know I did a lot of crazy, bad things.

28:59.950 --> 29:02.080
And what I did to you, I'm so sorry.

29:02.100 --> 29:02.700
Stop it.

29:02.740 --> 29:05.850
But I did it because you were the closest thing to him.

29:05.880 --> 29:11.240
You were a version of him, and I-I wanted him.

29:11.270 --> 29:14.200
I'm owed a visit!

29:15.890 --> 29:21.000
Even it's so I can say I'm sorry for what I did.

29:21.030 --> 29:24.120
So I can explain.

29:26.420 --> 29:28.600
Are you done?

29:40.340 --> 29:42.800
I'm gonna just st here.

29:42.830 --> 29:46.590
I'm gonna stay right here until he shows me his face.

29:48.190 --> 29:50.480
What's with all the freakin' dog bones?

29:50.510 --> 29:53.060
I'm here between-for like a week-between places.

29:53.090 --> 29:54.350
You're staying here?

29:54.380 --> 29:55.960
Yes.
I have the dog there.

29:55.980 --> 29:57.560
Tommy, have you seen him again?

29:59.490 --> 30:00.290
ladder...

30:00.320 --> 30:02.250
You know, do it if you want.

30:02.280 --> 30:03.600
Battalion...

30:10.120 --> 30:12.020
What?

30:13.100 --> 30:18.220
Gentlemen, the winning ticket says there's an elevator stopped between floors 15 and 16.

30:18.250 --> 30:22.210
There's 2 people trapped, and the super can see the car visible from the doors on 15.

30:22.230 --> 30:24.270
Start there, please be careful.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.990
- I hate these things.
- Yeah.

30:26.020 --> 30:29.150
Guys, we got no access to the elevator shaft.

30:29.170 --> 30:32.400
We're gonna have to go up, we're gonna have to smash a hole into the blind shaft.

30:32.420 --> 30:34.200
- You got that, slaggy?
- Yeah, I got it.

30:34.220 --> 30:35.880
All right, good.
Let's go make a mess.

30:35.910 --> 30:37.480
It's 15 flights up, by the way.

30:37.510 --> 30:38.550
- What?!
- You're kidding, right?

30:38.580 --> 30:40.270
Yeah.
Do I look like I'm kidding?

30:50.560 --> 30:51.820
- Tighter.
- Ll right, it's tight.

30:51.840 --> 30:54.670
Tighter. Last time I had thisuch rope near my balls,

30:54.720 --> 30:56.780
I was aring a leather mask, gettin' my ass paddled.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.440
Oh, yeah, s&m club?

30:58.460 --> 31:00.510
No, it's thanksgiving about 5 years ago.

31:10.980 --> 31:12.400
Easy.

31:17.750 --> 31:20.480
Here we go.

31:20.860 --> 31:22.640
Easy, easy, easy.

31:22.660 --> 31:24.530
Got him, got him.

31:24.560 --> 31:26.160
Wanna grab the groceries?

31:26.190 --> 31:27.590
Of course, the groceries.

31:27.620 --> 31:29.930
Ok. Oh.
All right.

31:40.870 --> 31:42.310
Wow.

31:42.340 --> 31:44.380
Holy it.

31:44.410 --> 31:45.820
You want to go again?

31:45.850 --> 31:47.600
Must you be such an asshole?

31:47.630 --> 31:48.910
What's a matter with you?

31:48.940 --> 31:50.620
You're not afraid of heights.

31:50.640 --> 31:52.860
No, claustrophobia, remember?

31:52.880 --> 31:54.300
Oh, yeah.

32:10.950 --> 32:12.420
My dad here?

32:12.440 --> 32:16.720
Oh, uh, no, I haven't seen him.

32:16.750 --> 32:19.050
Should I leave a message or something?

32:19.070 --> 32:19.980
Yeah.

32:20.870 --> 32:22.740
Tell him he ruined my goddamned life.

32:22.770 --> 32:23.840
I hate his guts.

32:23.860 --> 32:25.540
I hope his soul rots in hell.

32:26.240 --> 32:27.840
Are you gonna write this down?

32:27.870 --> 32:30.220
I'm pretty sure I ain't gonna forget this.

32:30.250 --> 32:31.890
Ruined your life, rot in hell, hate his guts.

32:31.910 --> 32:34.020
Yeah, I got it.
Anything else?

32:34.060 --> 32:35.290
Yeah.

32:35.350 --> 32:40.190
Ok, tell him never, ever, ever, ever, ever to call me ever again!

32:40.230 --> 32:42.580
You sure about that?

32:43.620 --> 32:45.020
Sorry.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.980
Bastard really gets under your skin, don't he?

32:48.600 --> 32:50.270
You have no idea.

32:50.300 --> 32:52.540
Oh, I think I do.

32:55.790 --> 32:57.240
Thanks.

33:03.810 --> 33:05.880
See you around.

33:14.410 --> 33:16.530
What are you doing here?

33:17.260 --> 33:20.800
Excuse me. I thought that you said that we weren't seeing each other anymore.

33:20.830 --> 33:23.790
Why don't you just make yourself right at home?Come on in.

33:24.950 --> 33:26.680
Hey!

33:27.510 --> 33:30.870
Hey, excuse mewhat do you thk you're doing?

33:30.900 --> 33:33.250
What, are you kidding me?

33:33.270 --> 33:36.130
I don't go to your house and throw your shit all over the place.

33:36.160 --> 33:38.690
Are you look- why don't you tell me what you're looking for?

33:38.720 --> 33:40.140
- You know what?
- What are you doing?

33:40.170 --> 33:41.660
Put that one on.

33:41.680 --> 33:43.820
These are really nice shoes.

33:43.850 --> 33:46.210
I'd really prefer you didn't- what?

33:48.070 --> 33:49.460
Put those on.

33:49.480 --> 33:52.010
I'll meet you downstairs.

34:17.380 --> 34:20.310
You want to tell me what's going on?

34:20.330 --> 34:22.120
I'm hungry.

34:22.150 --> 34:23.460
So?

34:24.190 --> 34:26.429
Start cooking.

34:29.590 --> 34:32.320
You want me to cook for you?

34:33.150 --> 34:35.110
Yep.

34:35.139 --> 34:37.630
Take your hair down, by the way.

34:39.360 --> 34:41.090
All right.

34:44.900 --> 34:46.969
That's for you to drink.

34:48.010 --> 34:50.190
That's for me torink d

34:50.219 --> 34:52.630
there you go.

34:52.650 --> 34:54.250
All right?

35:06.170 --> 35:09.250
Once you're done cooking the steaks,

35:09.280 --> 35:13.250
and I have eaten, then

35:13.280 --> 35:15.770
I'm gonna lay you across this table and

35:15.800 --> 35:17.360
make love to you.

35:17.380 --> 35:19.710
I just have one question.

35:21.280 --> 35:23.900
How do you like your meat?

35:29.520 --> 35:31.400
There it is, dad.

35:31.420 --> 35:34.720
Just like you asked for.
Minor league baseball at its best.

35:34.750 --> 35:36.840
All right, so we got 3 up here and then we got 2 more down there.

35:36.870 --> 35:38.770
So me and my old man will take the 2 down there, all right?

35:38.790 --> 35:41.230
Me and your old man will sit down there, you guys take these three.

35:41.250 --> 35:42.220
What are you talkin' about?

35:42.240 --> 35:43.640
Well, why do you get the good seats?

35:43.670 --> 35:45.240
What do you mean, why do I get the good seats?

35:45.260 --> 35:47.290
- Seniority.
- We're old.

35:47.360 --> 35:48.410
And fat.

35:48.430 --> 35:50.320
Hey, you're no swimsuit model, either, you know.

35:50.350 --> 35:52.020

It's just been crazy here.

36:15.130 --> 36:16.440
- How's richie?
- Oh, he's great.

36:16.470 --> 36:17.770
You know, we're having a great time.

36:17.780 --> 36:19.210
Everything good in chicago?

36:19.220 --> 36:24.400
Franco, I haven't been, uh, 100% honest with you.

36:24.420 --> 36:26.630
You're there with your new boyfriend. I know.

36:27.650 --> 36:29.020
You know?

36:29.040 --> 36:30.980
Yeah, richie let it slip.

36:31.010 --> 36:32.620
It's cool.

36:33.270 --> 36:35.230
It's cool?

36:35.250 --> 36:37.480
I mean, hey, you know, you need some time to figure things out.

36:37.510 --> 36:39.340
I understand that.
I've been there.

36:39.360 --> 36:42.190
Last thing I want to do is pile on the pressure, so...

36:42.670 --> 36:44.250
I don't know.

36:44.270 --> 36:45.320
You know, I love you, natalie.

36:45.340 --> 36:47.260
I want you to have all the space and time you need to

36:47.290 --> 36:49.230
make the decision that's right for you, so

36:49.260 --> 36:51.470
stay in chicago as long as you need to.

36:51.490 --> 36:53.170
Do whatever it is you gotta do.

36:53.190 --> 36:54.940
And, you know, when you get back to new york,

36:54.970 --> 36:57.070
if you still want me, I'll be waiting. Ok?

36:57.100 --> 37:00.100
Wow, franco.
That's, um...

37:00.130 --> 37:04.630
that's the sweetest, dearest thing you've ever said to me.

37:04.650 --> 37:06.550
So, um...

37:06.570 --> 37:08.970
yeah, I guess I'll just keep an eye on richie and

37:09.000 --> 37:10.600
talk to you when you get backyeah?

37:10.630 --> 37:12.390
Give him my love.

37:12.420 --> 37:14.820

37:15.500 --> 37:17.620

Ra Thank you for being so understanding.

37:21.240 --> 37:23.390
Hey, whatever it takes, babe.

37:24.220 --> 37:26.230
All right, bye.

37:36.540 --> 37:38.910
- Nice ballpark.(Thanks for bringin' me, kid.)

37:38.940 --> 37:40.290
- Who needs brooklyn, right?
- Yeah.

37:40.320 --> 37:42.820
(Anytime, Dad. Least I could do.)

37:47.110 --> 37:49.040
Ah, come on!

37:49.070 --> 37:49.800
Beer here.

37:49.820 --> 37:52.760
Jesus, what are these, the midget seats?

37:52.780 --> 37:54.560
My god, now I know why they call yankee stadium

37:54.600 --> 37:56.120
the house that ruth built.

37:56.150 --> 37:59.570
Those seats are big enough for giant fat asses like mine.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.980
This is a minor league seat, I got a major league ass.

38:02.000 --> 38:03.150
Beer here.

38:03.180 --> 38:04.360
These guys are killing me.

38:04.380 --> 38:06.780
Hey, pal, will you give it a break?
I'm an alcoholic!

38:06.810 --> 38:08.970
So am I.
Go call your sponsor.

38:10.650 --> 38:12.240
I know what you're doing, jesus.

38:12.260 --> 38:13.680
You're testing me, right?

38:13.700 --> 38:17.400
Surrounding me with temptation just to see how I'll respond?

38:17.420 --> 38:19.950
I'll show you.
I can be strong.

38:19.970 --> 38:21.320
I can do it.

38:21.340 --> 38:22.780
Beer here.

38:24.950 --> 38:26.140
Ah, hell!

38:26.170 --> 38:27.600
Hey, you.
Over here.

38:28.050 --> 38:29.290
How many?

38:29.310 --> 38:30.990
How much for the whole tray?

38:31.010 --> 38:33.280
20 beers, 5.50 a piece?

38:33.300 --> 38:34.400
It's a bk teuc

38:34.430 --> 38:35.960
Tell you what. I'll give you 200,

38:35.990 --> 38:37.840
you stay the hell out of this section.

38:37.870 --> 38:38.910
Deal.

38:38.940 --> 38:41.540
Beers for everyonE.
Pass it around.

38:41.560 --> 38:42.550
Thanks, ted.

38:42.570 --> 38:43.850
Everybody, everybody.

38:43.870 --> 38:45.960
Everybody but me.

38:46.650 --> 38:49.420
Look at the size of that screen in left field, dad, huh?

38:49.440 --> 38:53.910
It's probably as high as the, uh, green monster in fenway, right?

38:53.940 --> 38:55.630
Yeah.

38:55.650 --> 38:57.390
Makes me think of yaz.

38:57.410 --> 38:58.650
Yeah.

38:58.670 --> 39:02.680
- Carl yastrzemski
- Carl yastrzemski,

39:02.710 --> 39:04.200
the man they call yaz,

39:04.250 --> 39:06.330
- we love him
- We love him

39:06.370 --> 39:08.300
- That song sucked.
- Yeah.

39:08.330 --> 39:10.190
Horrible song.

39:10.220 --> 39:11.540
Who invented that song?

39:11.560 --> 39:14.010
I think it was probably yaz's mom.

39:15.620 --> 39:17.600
You know the only thing I hate about watching games live?

39:17.620 --> 39:19.110
Going to the men's room?

39:19.130 --> 39:20.480
Yeah, ok, well, 2 things.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.920
It's just so slow, you know?

39:21.950 --> 39:24.210
It's like you're sittin' there half the time

39:24.240 --> 39:25.420
just waitin' for something to happen.

39:25.440 --> 39:26.680
It's ridiculous.
It's like work.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.100
It's like life.

39:28.130 --> 39:31.440
Actually, baseball's the perfect metaphor for life.

39:31.460 --> 39:33.070
I read something like that in a book once.

39:33.090 --> 39:34.610
You read a book?

39:34.630 --> 39:36.320
Well-well, no.

39:36.340 --> 39:38.310
It was one of those hbo documentaries.

39:38.330 --> 39:39.910
Bob costas hosted it.

39:39.930 --> 39:41.730
- He's a midget.
- Is he really?

39:41.750 --> 39:45.010
Well, close to it. He could fit 2 of his asses in tse shets.

39:45.030 --> 39:48.210
Anyy, bwaeball and life, one and the same.

39:48.780 --> 39:51.410
Everyby saod that life is too short.

39:51.440 --> 39:52.970
Bullshit.

39:53.010 --> 39:56.660
Life, unless you get cancer or hit by a bus or set on fire,

39:56.700 --> 39:57.890
it takes forever.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.750
Just like baseball.

39:59.770 --> 40:01.570
It's a series of long,

40:01.590 --> 40:05.080
mind-bogglingly boring stretches of time where

40:05.120 --> 40:07.560
absolutely nothing happens.

40:07.590 --> 40:10.880
So, you take a nap.

40:10.900 --> 40:14.180
And then, after a little while,

40:14.230 --> 40:18.270
when that crisp crack of a bat hitting the ball,

40:18.310 --> 40:22.050
so crisp you could almost smell that wood burning,

40:22.080 --> 40:24.920
jolts you awake and you open your eyes

40:24.950 --> 40:28.790
to see something so exciting and intricate

40:28.830 --> 40:33.850
and possibly very, very meaningful has just happenedbut

40:33.880 --> 40:35.730
you missed it because you were

40:35.760 --> 40:39.190
just so goddamn bored in the first place.

40:39.210 --> 40:42.910
You know, a couple of hot dogs,

40:42.950 --> 40:44.720
throw in some beers,

40:44.800 --> 40:47.510
the occasional blow job, and that's that.

40:53.610 --> 40:55.270
What happened?

40:55.300 --> 40:57.810
You know, these guys got a couple more runs,

40:57.830 --> 41:00.890
- it's basically over.
- Yeah, I know.

41:01.305 --> 41:07.779
