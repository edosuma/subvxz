00:34.435 --> 00:38.383
Marriage has always been
a big deal to my mother.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.050
She loves weddings.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.218
Especially hers.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.882
And hers.

00:51.552 --> 00:53.293
And hers.

00:57.958 --> 00:59.460
And, well...

01:00.060 --> 01:01.562
you get the picture.

01:09.903 --> 01:13.407
But as easy as it was for
my mom to get married...

01:13.474 --> 01:15.010
Whee!

01:16.577 --> 01:18.579
my relationships...

01:20.147 --> 01:22.753
have never been
cleared for takeoff.

01:28.922 --> 01:33.428
I fell in love again
and it happened in a minute

01:34.728 --> 01:39.143
My eyes shot out like a fish out
of water and I'm jumpin' in it

01:39.800 --> 01:42.838
Oh, I don't hold back
No, I don't hold back

01:42.903 --> 01:45.440
I never stay within the lines

01:46.040 --> 01:48.714
I don't hold back
No, I don't hold back

01:48.776 --> 01:51.256
I'm gonna take what's mine

01:52.713 --> 01:55.421
Oh, don't get scared for me

01:55.749 --> 01:57.990
Just be prepared for me

01:58.052 --> 02:02.523
'Cause I'm in love with love

02:02.589 --> 02:03.932
In love

02:03.991 --> 02:09.737
When it comes to love
can't get enough

02:10.064 --> 02:15.673
I'm not gonna change, I'm not gonna
change, I'm not gonna change my ways

02:16.003 --> 02:21.976
'Cause I'm in love with love

02:22.042 --> 02:27.424
'Cause I'm in love with love

02:27.481 --> 02:33.796
When it comes to love
can't get enough

02:33.887 --> 02:36.595
Can't get enough

02:36.724 --> 02:40.831
I always wanted to be a
flight attendant. It's a great job.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.799
You get to travel around the world,

02:42.863 --> 02:45.810
meet interesting people
and see exotic places.

02:46.500 --> 02:50.346
But that hasn't left
a whole lat of time for love.

02:50.671 --> 02:53.345
My mom says it's
because I'm too picky.

02:53.574 --> 02:56.851
I don't think I'm picky.
I just know what I don't want.

02:57.511 --> 03:00.685
I don't want a man
with wandering eyes.

03:01.014 --> 03:03.688
Or one that cares
more about his work than me.

03:04.118 --> 03:06.962
I don't want a guy with
too much attitude.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.796
Or too little ambition.

03:11.024 --> 03:14.028
But I also don't want
to end up alone...

03:14.361 --> 03:16.705
living in a house
full of cats...

03:17.030 --> 03:18.873
smelling like soup.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.770
And I don't want to spend
my entire life...

03:21.835 --> 03:23.712
listening to my mother tell me

03:24.004 --> 03:25.745
how she can find five husbands...

03:25.873 --> 03:28.046
and I can't even find one.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.386
But she won't be able
to say that for long.

03:31.712 --> 03:35.717
A few months ago, I met this
amazing guy on a flight to Miami.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.222
His name is Graham.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.889
And I think he's the one.

03:42.656 --> 03:45.159
"I've had a change
of business plans...

03:45.392 --> 03:48.999
"...and it looks like I'll be spending
Thanksgiving at home in Chicago."

03:49.229 --> 03:51.072
"I know it's short notice, but..."

03:51.331 --> 03:52.833
Give me that.

03:53.033 --> 03:56.913
"... If you can make it, I would love
for you to join me for a weekend...

03:57.237 --> 03:59.217
"...you'll never forget."

04:00.073 --> 04:01.347
"Love, Graham."

04:01.575 --> 04:02.747
Graham is...

04:04.244 --> 04:06.588
Someone I've been dating
for a few months.

04:06.847 --> 04:10.795
- Wow. A few months? That's a record, Mo.
- Shut up.

04:10.851 --> 04:11.852
Ta-da!

04:12.352 --> 04:14.354
Montana! Buongiorno!

04:14.588 --> 04:15.931
Buongiorno, Taylor.

04:16.190 --> 04:18.761
It's zeppole. Italian donuts.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.098
Thank you, but I'm
watching my figure.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.035
Okay, but if you
change your mind, there's plenty.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.099
- Aw!
- Ciao bella.

04:26.333 --> 04:29.109
- Ciao bella.
- I'll get you some milk.

04:29.236 --> 04:30.943
Sounds great.

04:31.271 --> 04:34.218
She's so sweet.
What's with the Italian?

04:34.441 --> 04:36.785
She planned a trip to Rome
for our one-year anniversary.

04:36.844 --> 04:37.845
William!

04:37.945 --> 04:39.288
How do you turn your oven off?

04:39.546 --> 04:43.961
Oh! Okay, babe, I'll be right there.
I just put in a new oven.

04:44.218 --> 04:47.392
Of course you did.
Are you ever going to finish that place?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.396
- William?
- Hey?

04:49.456 --> 04:50.457
Got it.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.662
Aw, I'm coming.

04:51.725 --> 04:53.227
- Okay, good.
- Okay.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.564
I got to go.

04:54.695 --> 04:55.799
Yes, you do.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.064
Good luck in Rome.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.077
If it were me,
I would have chosen Paris.

05:00.133 --> 05:01.168
Hmm.

05:01.235 --> 05:02.646
So romantic.

05:03.003 --> 05:04.004
Good luck in Chicago.

05:04.238 --> 05:06.411
You think just because someone...

05:06.640 --> 05:11.146
sends me a rose, I'm just going
to fly off to whatever town he's in?

05:11.478 --> 05:12.821
Absolutely.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.491
According to my mother, you're not
a lady unless you're married...

05:16.550 --> 05:18.655
on or before your 30th birthday,

05:19.152 --> 05:21.758
and you're not a woman
until you've had at least two kids.

05:21.989 --> 05:24.663
If you Te not a lady
and you Te not a woman...

05:25.158 --> 05:27.160
you're like my best friend, Gail.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.666
Warm nuts?

05:36.837 --> 05:39.181
Oh, I'm so sorry.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.343
I got your nuts all messy.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.687
Sorry about that.

05:49.182 --> 05:50.525
That all better?

05:51.518 --> 05:52.792
Good.

05:58.292 --> 06:00.135
Happy Thanksgiving. Welcome.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.033
I could have been late, too.

06:02.296 --> 06:05.209
Remember 9F?
Boston to Cleveland?

06:05.532 --> 06:08.638
He invited me to his cabin in Vermont.
But I couldn't go.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.873
Why? Because I had to
be at work on time.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.707
- Happy Thanksgiving.
- Hi.

06:14.474 --> 06:16.818
Why are you working?
I thought you were off.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.217
I was. And now I'm not.

06:19.546 --> 06:20.547
Hello.

06:20.681 --> 06:21.716
Sam.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.920
I misplaced my badge.
Gail, could you check your cleavage?

06:27.154 --> 06:29.065
Trolling for men again, I see.

06:29.890 --> 06:31.494
Hi. Welcome aboard.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.834
So check this out.
A friend of my cousin's...

06:36.063 --> 06:38.543
bought a penthouse
on top of the Water Tower

06:38.632 --> 06:40.908
and he's having a party tonight.

06:41.168 --> 06:44.308
Lots of celebrities.
Oprah's supposed to be there.

06:44.371 --> 06:45.932
And Stedman.
How often does that happen?

06:46.506 --> 06:49.146
I have a plus one...
it has your name on it.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.688
Don't thank me, it's no problem.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.246
Wow, Sam.

06:52.512 --> 06:56.858
That sounds amazing.
I'd love to... but I can't.

06:59.853 --> 07:02.857
A person would need a hell of a
reason not to party with Oprah.

07:03.090 --> 07:06.196
Like dying or giving birth
or getting married.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.769
Cranberry juice.

07:12.933 --> 07:14.276
You're getting married?

07:14.534 --> 07:16.377
Montana is not getting married.

07:16.603 --> 07:19.777
If she was, being her best
friend, I'd know first.

07:20.040 --> 07:21.951
- I'm not getting married.
- See?

07:22.209 --> 07:23.210
Not yet.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.557
See? Does Mr. Not Yet have a name?

07:27.214 --> 07:28.386
Graham.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.125
Graham Jackson.

07:30.384 --> 07:32.557
5C, Philadelphia
to Chicago Graham Jackson?

07:32.786 --> 07:36.461
Blue Label on the rocks,
seven figures a year Graham Jackson?

07:37.791 --> 07:41.136
He could have invited
me for any holiday.

07:41.461 --> 07:42.963
Christmas, New Year's Eve.

07:43.230 --> 07:44.573
But Thanksgiving?

07:45.132 --> 07:48.636
Thanksgiving feels like... forever.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.904
- Yes, it does.
- You think so?

07:52.305 --> 07:54.342
There'll be more than
turkey getting stuffed.

07:54.408 --> 07:55.751
Such a hooker.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.819
Shut up. Does your mother know?

07:58.078 --> 08:00.183
No, and she won't
until I have a ring on this finger,

08:00.247 --> 08:02.193
which may be this weekend.

08:02.582 --> 08:04.323
I just have a feeling.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.991
I'm sorry.
Be right there with your vodka.

08:13.460 --> 08:14.461
Montana...

08:15.696 --> 08:19.701
when my grandmother
was very sick, she gave me this.

08:20.033 --> 08:22.274
I couldn't understand
what she was saying...

08:22.369 --> 08:24.542
she was in and out of
consciousness, but...

08:25.539 --> 08:27.849
I want you to have it.
It'll help you find true love.

08:27.941 --> 08:30.387
Aw! Thank you, Sam.
That's so sweet.

08:30.610 --> 08:32.283
I'm about to go.

08:32.546 --> 08:35.720
But before I do,
I want you to have these.

08:37.284 --> 08:40.288
Cranberry flavored
for the holidays.

08:42.054 --> 08:43.432
Go get 'em, girl.

08:43.557 --> 08:44.900
Thanks, Gail.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.765
These waters

08:50.564 --> 08:53.477
Can get a little busy

08:54.901 --> 08:57.507
But I've got experience

08:59.940 --> 09:03.478
Don't mind trekking
through the storm

09:03.577 --> 09:04.749
Wow.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.756
Graham, you've talked
about this for so long.

09:08.081 --> 09:13.087
I can't believe I finally got to see it.
It's absolutely beautiful.

09:14.755 --> 09:16.530
This is the first
time we're together

09:16.656 --> 09:18.431
in the city where I actually live.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.605
I wanted this to be special.

09:23.697 --> 09:24.835
It is.

09:24.931 --> 09:28.606
I wanted you to see a part of
me that most people don't.

09:34.274 --> 09:35.947
Look at that water.

09:36.777 --> 09:40.623
It just seems like it could go
on and on, forever and ever.

09:43.116 --> 09:45.960
That's what I felt
the day you walked into my life.

09:46.686 --> 09:48.359
And I was hoping...

09:48.955 --> 09:53.802
that we could go on and
on and on and on. Forever.

09:54.461 --> 09:55.804
Really?

09:59.733 --> 10:02.475
And ever since we first met

10:02.769 --> 10:08.048
I knew that I,
I knew I was ready baby

10:09.743 --> 10:12.553
To take that dive

10:12.746 --> 10:16.216
I'll be inside when
the tides are rolling baby

10:16.349 --> 10:20.798
You'll be at my place tonight,
all night

10:21.555 --> 10:22.966
All night, baby

10:23.023 --> 10:27.665
I'm not afraid to try

10:27.961 --> 10:32.273
And knew I, don't mind
playing in the rain

10:33.200 --> 10:36.579
And I was hoping that I'd get to

10:36.970 --> 10:41.749
Take that dive

10:41.808 --> 10:46.484
It's raining and I don't mind
if I get wet, baby

10:46.546 --> 10:53.521
Lovin' made you so wet,
your legs, your thighs

10:53.720 --> 10:56.633
And ever since we first met

10:56.690 --> 10:59.967
I knew that I

11:00.026 --> 11:01.528
I knew I was

11:01.862 --> 11:02.863
ready, baby

11:03.830 --> 11:07.209
To take that dive

11:09.202 --> 11:10.374
Sweetie?

11:11.204 --> 11:12.547
We're here.

11:14.941 --> 11:16.784
I thought we were
going to your house.

11:17.544 --> 11:21.048
We were. But I got an
emergency phone call.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.224
I have to fly to New York.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.896
There's tons of paperwork
I have to look over.

11:26.119 --> 11:29.726
I have to prepare for a meeting.
I'm sorry.

11:29.956 --> 11:32.402
I booked you in the
best suite in town.

11:32.626 --> 11:35.800
I'll make it up to
you when I come back, I promise.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.208
I could help you.
I could come with you.

11:40.333 --> 11:41.676
That's sweet.

11:42.469 --> 11:44.415
Let me just take care
of this business.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.211
I'll be back in a couple days.

11:46.573 --> 11:48.075
Then it's just me and you.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.582
- All right?
- Okay.

11:51.000 --> 11:57.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:00.720 --> 12:01.755
Yes?

12:01.821 --> 12:03.266
Are you guys doing it?

12:03.490 --> 12:06.835
No. If we were doing it,
I would not be answering my phone.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.504
I would. So, how was it?

12:11.431 --> 12:12.933
None of your business.

12:13.166 --> 12:14.509
That bad, huh?

12:14.768 --> 12:15.769
I didn't say it was bad.

12:15.902 --> 12:17.108
You didn't say it was good.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.308
It was good.

12:18.438 --> 12:20.611
- Damn good.
- Then why are you on the phone?

12:20.840 --> 12:24.287
If you must know,
Graham had an emergency...

12:24.511 --> 12:26.855
business call and had to
fly out for an early meeting.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.189
Being a gentleman...

12:29.449 --> 12:32.453
he put me up at this amazing
hotel in one of the best suites.

12:32.686 --> 12:33.858
Girl, please.

12:34.454 --> 12:37.731
Montana, that man did not ask
you to fly all the way...

12:37.791 --> 12:40.931
to Chicago on
Thanksgiving to insist...

12:41.027 --> 12:44.201
that you stay in a hotel.
I smell a rat.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.465
I don't want to hear it.

12:45.799 --> 12:47.142
Hear what?

12:47.300 --> 12:49.143
That he dropped you off

12:49.202 --> 12:51.705
so he can dip his turkey neck
in another woman's gravy?

12:51.972 --> 12:53.645
Graham is not seeing another woman.

12:53.974 --> 12:55.317
- Prove it.
- How?

12:55.542 --> 12:58.216
Go to his house and
see for yourself.

12:58.478 --> 13:01.687
Gail, I am not
going over to that man's house.

13:01.748 --> 13:03.549
Do you know how crazy
that would make me look?

13:04.050 --> 13:05.393
Gail, I'm here.

13:05.652 --> 13:07.325
- Where?
- Graham's house.

13:07.654 --> 13:08.928
He came back and picked you up.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.329
Sort of.

13:13.493 --> 13:15.336
You went to his house uninvited?

13:15.562 --> 13:16.734
You told me to.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.567
I didn't think you'd do it.

13:18.665 --> 13:20.235
Are you kidding me?

13:20.667 --> 13:22.707
- What are you doing now?
- Going to his front door.

13:22.902 --> 13:25.246
Umm-umm. Do not knock
on that man's door.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.341
You'll look like a stalker.

13:27.574 --> 13:28.935
Right now you just look desperate.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.518
What am I supposed to do?

13:30.744 --> 13:31.848
Go to the back.

13:34.848 --> 13:36.191
Oh!

13:45.692 --> 13:46.864
Okay.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.706
What the hell was that?

13:55.902 --> 13:56.937
Hello?

13:57.037 --> 13:59.039
He's at the back door.
What do I do?

13:59.372 --> 14:02.046
Do you see a trash can?

14:02.375 --> 14:04.048
- Yeah. Why?
- Get in it.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.550
Are you crazy?
I'm not getting in a trash can.

14:06.780 --> 14:08.225
If I'm wrong about Graham...

14:08.448 --> 14:09.791
- ...and he catches you...
- Hello?

14:10.050 --> 14:12.394
At his house,
forget any future together.

14:13.219 --> 14:14.220
Get in the can!

14:25.465 --> 14:26.967
What are you doing?

14:27.300 --> 14:28.301
I'm in the trash can.

14:29.235 --> 14:30.236
Are you nuts?

14:30.370 --> 14:31.405
You told me to.

14:31.638 --> 14:32.810
Hello?

14:36.242 --> 14:37.243
Montana?

14:37.477 --> 14:38.649
I have to go.

15:20.019 --> 15:21.054
Yes?

15:21.121 --> 15:22.464
What are you doing now?

15:22.789 --> 15:24.462
Looking thru his window.

15:24.958 --> 15:27.962
Gail... it's beautiful.

15:28.194 --> 15:29.537
Any panties on the floor?

15:32.465 --> 15:34.103
No.

15:37.637 --> 15:40.880
He's preparing for his meeting,
just like he said he was.

15:42.475 --> 15:44.148
Gail was wrong.

15:44.477 --> 15:46.320
Graham was alone.

15:46.646 --> 15:48.489
And I was...

15:49.482 --> 15:51.655
right where I wanted to be.

15:52.152 --> 15:56.498
Sipping from the same mug.
Resting on the same rug.

15:56.823 --> 15:58.496
Just the two of us.

15:58.825 --> 16:00.498
And the kids.

16:00.827 --> 16:02.329
And friends.

16:08.168 --> 16:10.512
Toasting to our wonderful life.

16:14.674 --> 16:15.744
What was that noise?

16:16.409 --> 16:18.013
The sound of us toasting.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.756
No, that is the sound of
somebody coming in the house!

16:22.015 --> 16:23.187
Duck!

17:25.144 --> 17:28.215
Un-break my heart

17:28.281 --> 17:31.125
Say you'll love me again

17:33.119 --> 17:35.121
Undo this hurt you caused

17:35.188 --> 17:37.134
Oh my God.

17:37.290 --> 17:39.167
When you walked out the door

17:39.225 --> 17:41.933
And walked out of my life

17:41.995 --> 17:44.737
Un-cry these tears

17:47.967 --> 17:50.641
Montana? You want to talk about it?

17:51.404 --> 17:52.576
Go away.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.083
Hey.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.418
You've been playing
that song all day.

17:57.644 --> 17:59.089
Let's get something to eat.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.657
I don't want to get dressed.

18:00.913 --> 18:03.257
Okay, you don't have
to get dressed.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.761
But you got to get out
of this apartment.

18:06.319 --> 18:07.320
Okay?

18:08.655 --> 18:10.657
I don't have to get dressed?

18:11.090 --> 18:13.434
My cooking always cheers you up.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.305
A little wine.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.441
- Mo, you love avocado.
- All right.

18:28.341 --> 18:29.820
Look at that.

18:29.942 --> 18:32.354
Hey, vegan!

18:39.452 --> 18:43.195
We are so excited. We wanted
you to be the first to know.

18:43.456 --> 18:45.458
I wanted you to be
the first to know.

18:45.692 --> 18:46.693
After me.

18:46.759 --> 18:47.829
I'm engaged!

18:48.027 --> 18:51.031
Derrick proposed
with a two-carat diamond ring!

18:51.364 --> 18:54.038
I didn't get my first carat
until my third marriage.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.645
Montana, does this single rose mean
you're not single anymore?

18:58.538 --> 18:59.881
It's nothing.

19:00.206 --> 19:04.313
Sheree's fiance is taking us
all out to dinner tonight.

19:04.644 --> 19:07.488
I'm borrowing those earrings
I bought you for Christmas.

19:07.714 --> 19:11.059
Oh, yes, honey. I should
have bought them for myself!

19:11.384 --> 19:13.193
He's on track to break
the college record

19:13.319 --> 19:15.128
for most receptions in a season,

19:15.188 --> 19:16.394
maybe win a Heisman.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.400
You know I'm happy for
you, right, Sheree?

19:20.393 --> 19:21.736
But...

19:22.228 --> 19:24.902
you're just a
sophomore in college.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.508
You barely
know what you want to major in...

19:27.734 --> 19:30.510
much less, who you want to
spend the rest of your life with.

19:30.903 --> 19:32.007
Why now?

19:32.071 --> 19:34.517
Why not now? He's a great guy.

19:34.640 --> 19:37.086
And I don't want
to wait until I'm all old, like...

19:38.244 --> 19:39.245
Like me.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.355
I didn't mean it like that.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.083
What do you think?

19:44.083 --> 19:46.927
Yes? Fabulous? I hate them.

19:48.087 --> 19:50.192
Mom's letting me wear
her wedding dress.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.267
You can pick
whichever one you want.

19:54.594 --> 19:57.939
Only one thing that would make
this the best wedding ever.

20:00.233 --> 20:02.110
A bridesmaid again?

20:02.368 --> 20:06.111
I can't go to
my little sister's wedding single.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.613
I'll be the laughingstock
of my entire family.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.446
If you need a man,
I can get you one.

20:11.744 --> 20:12.825
Hey!

20:13.045 --> 20:16.049
Don't embarrass me.
It's not a man I need...

20:16.115 --> 20:18.959
it's a husband,
or a potential husband, in a month.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.720
Marry Gail.

20:20.787 --> 20:22.667
If she goes a week
without waxing her moustache,

20:22.688 --> 20:23.968
they'll think it's Steve Harvey.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.131
I'm serious.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.736
Why is it so hard to
find the right guy?

20:28.928 --> 20:29.929
Tell me about it.

20:30.129 --> 20:31.472
Tell me about it.

20:31.798 --> 20:34.142
A girl could have everything...

20:34.467 --> 20:38.176
an MBA, a J-O-B, but no M-A-N.

20:38.304 --> 20:41.808
That's because
men are intimidated by strong women.

20:42.141 --> 20:44.485
I never tell guys
that I have a degree.

20:44.911 --> 20:46.584
That's because you
don't have a degree.

20:46.813 --> 20:49.259
Sam, you keep missing
the damn point.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.993
I should give this back to you.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.595
It's hopeless with me.

20:58.491 --> 21:00.664
You won't show up single.
Give me your phone.

21:00.726 --> 21:01.932
Uh, uh, uh!

21:01.994 --> 21:04.167
Hang on. Now, look.

21:04.430 --> 21:06.432
She hasn't got time
to meet someone new.

21:06.566 --> 21:08.603
So why not revisit somebody old?

21:08.835 --> 21:10.678
But I don't even know...

21:11.003 --> 21:12.414
Picky is single.

21:12.472 --> 21:15.248
If we're lucky, one of these guys
has blossomed into Mr. Right.

21:16.108 --> 21:17.451
Let me see.

21:18.177 --> 21:20.521
She hasn't talked
to any of these guys in years.

21:20.780 --> 21:23.784
If she bumped into
one of them on a plane, she might.

21:24.016 --> 21:26.189
How would I know if
they were traveling?

21:26.452 --> 21:28.625
It's the holiday season...
everyone's traveling.

21:28.688 --> 21:31.066
And when someone
wants to fly, what do they do?

21:31.190 --> 21:32.191
Book a flight.

21:32.358 --> 21:33.860
There's Tanya in ticketing.

21:34.193 --> 21:37.538
I'm Tanya. Welcome to
TransAlliance. May I see your I.D.?

21:37.797 --> 21:39.708
Frankie in the Frequent
Flyer program.

21:39.966 --> 21:42.310
Thank you for choosing
TransAlliance.

21:42.535 --> 21:43.735
I turned them on to my hook-up

21:43.769 --> 21:45.976
at Louis Vuitton so
they owe me biggies.

21:46.572 --> 21:48.813
There's Calvin at
curbside check-in.

21:48.875 --> 21:50.548
Hi, I'm Calvin at curbside.

21:50.877 --> 21:53.551
Welcome to TransAlliance,
a flight you can afford...

21:53.813 --> 21:56.487
where your soul and bag
can be on one accord.

21:56.716 --> 21:59.219
And there's Cedric in security.

21:59.485 --> 22:03.729
First name, Cedric. Last name, take
everything out of your pockets!

22:03.990 --> 22:05.731
I need your pockets
out of your pockets!

22:05.992 --> 22:07.835
For the next few weeks,
any ex of yours

22:07.960 --> 22:09.837
who flies anywhere, we'll know.

22:10.062 --> 22:12.906
We just arrange your schedule
so you're on that flight.

22:14.166 --> 22:18.478
First of all, this is the stupidest
idea ever. Secondly of all...

22:18.538 --> 22:19.539
There's the degree.

22:19.906 --> 22:23.581
Assuming you could find out
when these guys are flying...

22:23.843 --> 22:26.517
which I doubt,
because it's your dumb-ass idea...

22:26.579 --> 22:27.614
Gail!

22:27.680 --> 22:31.753
These are all men you've dated
before, and it didn't work out.

22:32.018 --> 22:34.692
So what is going to
make this any different?

22:34.921 --> 22:36.696
Because this time, she's different.

22:36.923 --> 22:40.427
Same action, same outcome.
New actions, new outcome.

22:40.760 --> 22:44.367
Clearly, we have all
had too much to drink.

22:44.597 --> 22:49.046
This is illegal. We can all get
fired, and we can go to jail.

22:49.101 --> 22:52.446
Or we could come to the aid of
the sweetest...

22:52.705 --> 22:55.549
and most romantically
deserving human being alive...

22:55.775 --> 22:59.780
and help her find the truest
and fastest love of her life.

23:00.947 --> 23:04.292
We have thirty days
and 30,000 miles.

23:04.550 --> 23:06.461
To be brought up on federal charges.

23:06.719 --> 23:08.721
To find me a husband.

23:13.626 --> 23:17.802
I don't understand why you guys
think this is a good idea.

23:18.130 --> 23:22.977
It's the 21st century.
You don't need a man to define you.

23:27.139 --> 23:30.313
Everyone I know
is getting married and having kids.

23:30.576 --> 23:31.748
So what?

23:31.978 --> 23:34.322
I want someone to love me, too.

23:35.648 --> 23:38.128
Someone who thinks I'm the best.

23:38.217 --> 23:40.060
Who only sees me in the room.

23:41.153 --> 23:44.157
I know it might sound corny
or unrealistic, but...

23:45.658 --> 23:47.831
I know he's out there.

23:48.327 --> 23:50.500
And I don't want to
wait any longer.

23:53.099 --> 23:55.943
And you think you can
find him in 30 days?

23:57.003 --> 23:59.005
Of course not!

23:59.672 --> 24:00.844
Maybe?

24:05.411 --> 24:06.446
Hey Sam.

24:06.512 --> 24:08.514
- It actually worked.
- What worked?

24:08.781 --> 24:10.590
Our plan.
He's flying from Los Angeles

24:10.716 --> 24:12.525
to New York, connecting in Houston.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.128
- Who?
- One of your exes.

24:14.353 --> 24:15.957
Damon Diesel.

24:16.022 --> 24:17.023
One second!

24:17.289 --> 24:18.529
You've got to be kidding me.

24:18.624 --> 24:20.934
Damon Diesel
could barely take care of himself,

24:20.993 --> 24:22.301
much less a family.

24:22.361 --> 24:24.568
Google him. He's produced three

24:24.697 --> 24:26.870
number-one singles
in the last year.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.373
And he's Essence?
"Bachelor of the Month".

24:28.467 --> 24:31.107
He is looking for Mrs. Diesel.

24:32.338 --> 24:34.340
Hey! I'm on the toilet!

24:34.540 --> 24:36.713
Sam? I love you,

24:36.776 --> 24:39.382
- but I'm not getting on that flight. Okay?
- Montana!

24:41.213 --> 24:43.557
Oh, God, my mother
came over uninvited again.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.227
I will jack you up!
I will jack you up hard!

24:46.485 --> 24:47.555
I got to go.

24:49.221 --> 24:50.564
Montana.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.560
Honey, Mama's having a rough day.

24:54.226 --> 24:56.672
All this planning for
your sister's wedding...

24:56.796 --> 24:59.242
it's making me feel
like such a failure.

24:59.565 --> 25:03.012
Mom, five marriages
doesn't make you a failure.

25:03.235 --> 25:04.839
I wasn't talking about me.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.178
I started thinking...

25:08.574 --> 25:11.783
my youngest
daughter is marrying a wonderful...

25:11.844 --> 25:13.915
handsome, athletic young man.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.589
Yes, she is.

25:15.915 --> 25:19.920
And I might not even be alive to
see my oldest do the same.

25:20.586 --> 25:25.262
Anyway, we have to discuss your
sister's rehearsal dinner...

25:25.591 --> 25:28.595
seeing you are a
maid of honor again.

25:28.861 --> 25:32.866
I would love to talk about this,
but I have a flight to catch.

25:33.099 --> 25:35.943
Why didn't you tell me
you had a flight to catch?

25:36.202 --> 25:38.546
If you had called, I
would have told you.

25:38.771 --> 25:41.274
Make sure you call me when you land.

25:41.540 --> 25:45.283
I will call you whenever
I get to wherever I'm going.

25:45.611 --> 25:48.285
- I love you.
- Yeah, I love you.

25:55.621 --> 25:57.965
Sam? What's the flight number?

25:59.091 --> 26:03.403
I fell in love again
and it happened in a minute

26:05.064 --> 26:09.376
My eyes shot out like a fish out
of water and I'm jumpin' in it

26:10.903 --> 26:13.509
Oh, don't get scared for me

26:13.873 --> 26:15.944
Just be prepared for me

26:16.041 --> 26:22.014
'Cause I'm in love with love in love

26:22.648 --> 26:23.820
Taxi!

26:24.150 --> 26:25.652
Taxi! Taxi!

26:27.486 --> 26:29.488
William! William!

26:34.493 --> 26:35.836
Sorry!

26:36.662 --> 26:40.337
I have to get to the airport
fast... it's an emergency.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.010
- Somebody's looking good.
- Yeah?

26:44.436 --> 26:45.779
I almost didn't recognize you.

26:46.005 --> 26:48.849
Some of us like to update our
image every decade or so.

26:49.108 --> 26:51.418
This was the truck my father bought

26:51.544 --> 26:53.854
before he started his business.
It's vintage.

26:54.513 --> 26:56.288
I wasn't talking about the truck.

26:59.618 --> 27:01.620
You want to get to the airport?

27:04.857 --> 27:06.859
So what's the occasion?

27:06.926 --> 27:07.961
Oh,

27:08.027 --> 27:10.871
I'm meeting a friend in Houston,
then we're flying to New York.

27:11.130 --> 27:13.542
Why fly all the way to Houston

27:13.632 --> 27:16.044
to meet a friend
when New York is just an hour away?

27:17.703 --> 27:21.742
He doesn't exactly know I'm meeting him.
It's a surprise.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.315
Would this have anything to
do with Sheree's wedding?

27:25.578 --> 27:28.081
It has nothing to do with it.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.752
Okay, maybe it does. A little.

27:34.086 --> 27:36.589
My parents were together
almost 40 years...

27:37.089 --> 27:39.091
before my dad passed away.

27:39.758 --> 27:43.262
He kept the same job.
Drove the same truck.

27:43.596 --> 27:45.940
And stayed in love
with the same woman.

27:47.433 --> 27:51.609
Every night at six, there was an
oven-cooked meal waiting for him.

27:52.037 --> 27:53.038
The same one?

27:54.673 --> 27:56.016
Poor woman.

27:56.609 --> 27:58.111
You know, Mo...

27:59.445 --> 28:02.016
the magic isn't
in getting married.

28:02.481 --> 28:04.017
It's in the staying married.

28:05.618 --> 28:06.619
Yeah.

28:10.956 --> 28:13.960
William, I can't thank you enough.
Bye.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.462
Wish me luck, okay?

28:16.795 --> 28:18.138
I got my bag.

28:25.037 --> 28:26.038
I know, I know.

28:26.305 --> 28:29.149
- Your phone.
- I'm sorry. Bye.

28:29.575 --> 28:30.849
Hey! Hey!

28:34.813 --> 28:36.486
- Your earpiece.
- I'm sorry. You know me.

28:36.548 --> 28:38.323
Okay, see you later!

28:38.651 --> 28:39.652
- Thank you!
- Mo!

28:40.653 --> 28:42.655
Mo! Your lipstick!

28:43.322 --> 28:45.495
She's always forgetting something.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.164
Cedric!

28:52.665 --> 28:55.009
Nobody move! Back up! Nobody move!

28:55.334 --> 28:57.678
Sorry. Excuse me, it's an emergency.

29:00.506 --> 29:04.750
I have no life! Which gives
me all day to ruin yours!

29:05.077 --> 29:07.117
Welcome aboard
TransAlliance flight 143.

29:22.194 --> 29:24.299
Sam, I'm on the plane in a dress

29:24.430 --> 29:26.535
I can barely breathe in.
But he's not here.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.006
- Who?
- Damon Diesel. He's not on the flight.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.202
He is.

29:30.436 --> 29:31.779
No, he's not.

29:32.037 --> 29:33.607
This is ridiculous.

29:33.706 --> 29:35.083
I don't know how
you convinced me to do this,

29:35.207 --> 29:37.483
but I'm leaving. I love you, bye.

29:37.543 --> 29:39.784
I'd love to be the
stitches in that skirt.

29:41.547 --> 29:43.049
Montana Moore.

29:43.282 --> 29:44.625
Damon Diesel.

29:44.883 --> 29:48.057
- Wassup?
- Wow. Not much.

29:48.721 --> 29:51.065
You look great.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.302
You're in first class?

29:55.561 --> 29:57.563
That's the only way to ride.

30:01.567 --> 30:03.410
Okay, I'll be sitting down.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.481
Usually, I don't really
write about jewelry

30:06.572 --> 30:09.382
It's foolery, But something
about the way you look on my arm

30:09.441 --> 30:11.648
An arm on my neck
like you're my charm

30:11.710 --> 30:13.690
So, so fresh when we
step out at midnight

30:13.746 --> 30:15.783
Up to the spat we
chill and sit tight

30:18.417 --> 30:19.794
How long are you in town?

30:19.918 --> 30:21.261
Two or three days.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.800
I have meetings and family to see.

30:23.856 --> 30:25.096
How long are you in town?

30:25.157 --> 30:26.500
Long enough.

30:27.092 --> 30:28.765
Long enough for what?

30:29.261 --> 30:33.437
Long enough for us to spend some
quality time, if I'm allowed.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.176
You're allowed.

30:36.435 --> 30:38.779
Great. Let's go.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.181
Let's go.

30:41.440 --> 30:42.441
After you.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.985
I can't believe we
ran into each other. It's crazy.

30:49.615 --> 30:50.958
I'm busy.

30:51.617 --> 30:52.687
Damon Diesel.

30:52.818 --> 30:53.853
What's up, baby?

30:54.119 --> 30:55.154
Can I get you something to drink?

30:55.287 --> 30:56.288
The usual.

30:56.622 --> 31:00.297
A bottle of Chateau Margaux
'66, coming right up.

31:00.959 --> 31:03.371
You should think way
larger than that.

31:03.629 --> 31:05.131
- London, Dubai.
- Your check.

31:05.464 --> 31:06.807
Thank you.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.477
See you next time.

31:09.301 --> 31:12.646
Damon, I should
probably get back to my hotel.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.873
I have an early morning, and...

31:15.307 --> 31:17.810
a girl does need
her beauty rest.

31:18.977 --> 31:20.320
Real talk?

31:20.813 --> 31:24.989
You could stay awake the rest of
your life and still be beautiful.

31:26.485 --> 31:27.657
Thank you, Damon.

31:27.886 --> 31:29.888
Being with you tonight...

31:30.155 --> 31:33.568
you got a brother on
some till-death-do-we-part shit.

31:33.826 --> 31:36.500
Don't laugh. Why are you laughing?

31:37.729 --> 31:40.005
Damon. I've been
trying to reach you.

31:40.833 --> 31:42.870
Janine, Montana. Montana, Janine.

31:43.135 --> 31:44.170
Hi.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.580
Janine and her
husband work with me at the label.

31:46.839 --> 31:48.648
Can you call me when
you get a moment?

31:48.774 --> 31:50.583
I want to wrap up a few things.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.089
Have a good evening.

31:54.346 --> 31:55.620
It was really nice
to meet you, Janine.

31:55.747 --> 31:57.021
You, too.

31:58.684 --> 32:00.186
Where were we?

32:01.386 --> 32:02.387
To us.

32:08.694 --> 32:10.037
So this is it.

32:10.362 --> 32:12.364
Work hard, play hard, baby.

32:12.698 --> 32:14.200
Clearly.

32:14.867 --> 32:16.710
I want to show you something.

32:17.035 --> 32:18.708
Check this out.

32:21.273 --> 32:23.810
A little different
than the last time you saw me.

32:23.909 --> 32:25.286
You think?

32:25.544 --> 32:27.217
Hope you like it. Come on.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.050
Okay, coming.

32:31.717 --> 32:33.390
It's sexy, right?

32:34.386 --> 32:36.730
Yeah. Wow.

32:37.055 --> 32:39.558
Damon, you're doing big things.

32:39.892 --> 32:41.394
I'm impressed.

32:41.960 --> 32:43.735
I'm not getting in the hot tub.

32:47.733 --> 32:49.406
You know you want to.

32:49.735 --> 32:51.737
Maybe, but I'm not getting in.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.313
Okay.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.383
Will you stop acting silly?

32:59.578 --> 33:01.216
Is that meant to be inviting?

33:01.747 --> 33:02.782
Damon?

33:04.816 --> 33:07.490
Damon! Damon, I know you hear me!

33:07.753 --> 33:09.096
Who is that?

33:09.421 --> 33:11.094
You said you weren't
seeing anybody.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.324
That's Janine.

33:12.591 --> 33:13.934
From the restaurant?

33:14.159 --> 33:15.160
Damon!

33:15.427 --> 33:17.429
Damon, you better open up!

33:18.664 --> 33:20.610
It's your house.
Tell her you're busy.

33:20.832 --> 33:22.607
- I can't.
- Why not?

33:23.335 --> 33:27.613
This ain't my house.
It's hers. I can't afford this shit.

33:27.839 --> 33:30.012
Damon, open this damn door!

33:30.275 --> 33:31.948
- You can afford a Range Rover.
- Uh-uh.

33:32.177 --> 33:34.680
You have a titanium
American Express card.

33:34.947 --> 33:36.290
That's hers, too.

33:36.515 --> 33:37.687
You said she's married.

33:37.950 --> 33:39.793
She is. Sometimes she not.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.294
I know you got that ho
from the restaurant there!

33:42.521 --> 33:44.125
Who's she calling a ho?

33:44.189 --> 33:45.293
Shh!

33:45.357 --> 33:47.359
- I'm not shushing!
- You better shush.

33:47.626 --> 33:48.627
She crazy.

33:48.860 --> 33:51.636
I'll shoot you and that bitch,
'cause you know I'm crazy!

33:51.863 --> 33:54.469
I told you. She crazy.
Crazy! She crazy.

33:57.970 --> 33:59.643
Why are
you doing this to me?

33:59.871 --> 34:02.818
Open, open, open, open, open.
Open, open, open!

34:02.908 --> 34:04.251
When she come through the door...

34:04.309 --> 34:08.655
when she break the door
down, you don't want to be here.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.659
Well, where should I be?

34:14.719 --> 34:16.824
I am not getting on
that fire escape.

34:17.054 --> 34:18.659
Damon, open this damn door!

34:19.491 --> 34:20.764
Damon, I got something for you!

34:22.393 --> 34:24.195
- Where is this bitch?
- Nobody's here.

34:24.329 --> 34:26.070
Is Sam's
dumb-ass idea working?

34:26.331 --> 34:28.004
Did he pop the question?

34:28.333 --> 34:30.677
I'm on a fire escape!

34:31.003 --> 34:32.414
I'll assume that's a no.

34:32.670 --> 34:34.844
Anyway, bachelor number two...

34:35.072 --> 34:39.418
is on the flight
in the morning from Atlanta to D.C.

34:39.678 --> 34:41.521
You need to be at JFK in an hour

34:41.647 --> 34:43.524
to catch the last
commuter flight out...

34:43.748 --> 34:45.751
to make his morning
connecting flight.

34:46.018 --> 34:47.520
You've now got...

34:49.021 --> 34:53.367
sixty-nine...
I mean, fifty-nine minutes, honey.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.534
You got fifty-nine minutes.

34:56.094 --> 34:57.869
I'm looking
for the bitch, too!

34:58.096 --> 34:59.598
Bitch, where are you!

34:59.865 --> 35:02.038
Could this get any worse?

35:07.372 --> 35:10.717
Hey, Montana, it's your mother.
Listen.

35:11.043 --> 35:15.048
Sheree decided to have a
bridesmaid slumber party.

35:15.280 --> 35:19.126
We're all here in our pajamas
and we want you to come over.

35:19.384 --> 35:21.057
All right, sweetie, I love you.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.120
Uh-uh!

35:22.721 --> 35:26.066
You know you don't
need that cookie. Sit down.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.144
This is your pilot speaking.

35:38.403 --> 35:41.077
The flight time today
to Reagan International Airport

35:41.139 --> 35:42.914
is 1 hour, 40 minutes.

35:43.241 --> 35:45.585
Sit back and enjoy the short flight.

35:45.911 --> 35:47.788
Sir, may I offer you a blanket?

35:47.846 --> 35:49.348
No, thank you.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.087
Montana.

35:51.483 --> 35:52.757
Langston.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.055
Montana.

35:56.421 --> 35:58.594
Curtis. Hi.

35:59.491 --> 36:01.266
- Would you like a blanket?
- I'm okay.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.534
Hey!

36:08.600 --> 36:10.602
Two of m y exes are on the plane.

36:10.836 --> 36:13.612
I know about Langston.
Who's the other guy?

36:13.839 --> 36:15.841
Curtis.
He and Langston are both here.

36:16.108 --> 36:17.280
I'll get Sam.

36:19.111 --> 36:20.146
Curtis is here, too.

36:20.278 --> 36:21.279
You said he got married.

36:21.613 --> 36:24.958
I thought he did, but I don't think
he is now. No wedding ring.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.322
None of the married guys I
date wear wedding rings.

36:27.386 --> 36:28.729
It's tacky.

36:29.855 --> 36:33.359
Go with Langston. He's running for
Congress, so he needs a running mate.

36:35.961 --> 36:36.996
Curtis.

36:37.062 --> 36:38.132
Langston.

36:38.296 --> 36:39.468
You know Montana?

36:39.798 --> 36:41.471
Yeah, we're old friends.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.304
Flight attendants,
prepare the cabin for takeoff

36:48.974 --> 36:51.978
You know, I'm running
for Congress now.

36:52.310 --> 36:55.985
And I'm having dinner tonight
with some potentially major...

36:56.047 --> 36:58.049
campaign contributors.

36:58.316 --> 37:01.490
Would you know a young lady
- -Gorgeous, intelligent...

37:01.720 --> 37:04.564
that would be so
gracious as to join me?

37:04.823 --> 37:06.097
If asked, I might.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.498
Consider yourself asked.

37:07.726 --> 37:09.228
Consider yourself answered.

37:13.665 --> 37:16.009
Right over here, this is me.

37:16.835 --> 37:21.147
Wow. Langston,
you've done very well for yourself.

37:21.206 --> 37:25.211
Thank you. This is probably my
favorite room in the house.

37:25.677 --> 37:27.020
I can see why.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.253
Oh, you have a dog!

37:31.516 --> 37:34.520
Montana, this is Juicy.
Juicy, this is Montana.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.764
She's so cute. Can I pet her?

37:39.691 --> 37:42.194
Juicy. Stop that, shame on you.

37:42.527 --> 37:46.976
I'm sorry. She's jealous.
She likes to mark her territory.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.308
- Sorry about that.
- I understand.

37:49.367 --> 37:52.871
If you were around more,
Juicy wouldn't have these problems.

37:53.104 --> 37:56.711
So my being around
more often would be just for Juicy?

37:57.042 --> 37:59.044
Yes, strictly for Juicy.

38:00.378 --> 38:04.383
I hope it's okay... I had my assistant
pick you out something to wear.

38:04.616 --> 38:07.392
I'm assuming your
size is the same as I remember.

38:07.619 --> 38:08.962
I hope so.

38:10.055 --> 38:13.400
It's hanging in the bathroom
- -Two doors down to the left.

38:13.725 --> 38:15.398
Great. Okay.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.066
Bye, Juicy. We're going to be friends.

38:18.396 --> 38:20.239
I certainly hope so.

38:23.068 --> 38:24.411
See you shortly.

38:25.237 --> 38:26.739
Juicy, pee.

38:31.243 --> 38:32.984
God, I love that Juicy.

38:46.324 --> 38:50.329
Montana, allow me to introduce
you to Howard Donaldson...

38:50.595 --> 38:52.165
and his beautiful wife, Estelle.

38:52.430 --> 38:55.604
Mr. Donaldson is the owner and
founder of Donaldson Steel...

38:55.834 --> 39:00.112
the largest contractor
in the Washington metropolitan area.

39:00.338 --> 39:04.115
And who might this
stunning young lady be?

39:04.342 --> 39:07.289
She is too pretty to be your date.

39:07.445 --> 39:08.788
You got that right.

39:09.014 --> 39:13.463
This is Montana Moore,
my very significant other...

39:13.685 --> 39:17.360
who was gracious enough to
fly here to join us for dinner.

39:17.622 --> 39:22.469
Well, young lady, I hope you're
prepared to withstand the heat...

39:22.794 --> 39:25.798
which this coming
election will surely bring.

39:26.031 --> 39:28.307
Montana comes from a long line of

39:28.433 --> 39:30.709
flame-retardant women.
She'll be just fine.

39:30.969 --> 39:34.644
All right. I got a
great table, let's go.

39:35.807 --> 39:37.480
Flame retardant.

39:38.476 --> 39:39.819
He surprised me.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.488
How you doing, sir?

39:42.213 --> 39:43.521
May I take your drink order?

39:43.715 --> 39:47.390
I'll have a scotch,
single-malt, on the rocks...

39:47.652 --> 39:50.326
and a Shirley Temple
with extra cherries for my wife.

39:50.555 --> 39:53.900
That sounds good. I'll have
what the gentleman's having.

39:54.159 --> 39:56.833
The lady will also have a
Shirley Temple, extra cherries.

39:57.062 --> 39:59.064
Oh, no, actually, I'd like a...

39:59.331 --> 40:00.571
it's okay, I got it.

40:01.399 --> 40:02.901
A Shirley Temple, please.

40:09.007 --> 40:13.251
Actually, would you excuse us?
Lam dying to show Montana...

40:13.712 --> 40:16.124
the breathtaking
view of the atrium.

40:16.181 --> 40:17.182
Excuse us.

40:21.853 --> 40:23.196
Sweetheart, listen.

40:23.521 --> 40:24.882
These are the kind of contributors

40:24.956 --> 40:28.995
who want to know the candidate
they're investing in is a leader.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.404
A take-charge type of man.

40:31.463 --> 40:34.103
Now, if I sit there
and let you order your own drink,

40:34.165 --> 40:37.476
then that would be
like you're leading.

40:37.535 --> 40:39.037
Please, just bear with me.

40:39.304 --> 40:41.477
I promise, when this
thing is over...

40:41.706 --> 40:45.153
I'll take you anywhere and you can
order for the entire restaurant.

40:45.877 --> 40:49.552
But can you just do me this solid?
For me?

40:51.883 --> 40:52.884
Of course.

40:53.218 --> 40:54.720
- I'll do it for you.
- Thank you.

40:54.986 --> 40:57.057
You look great tonight.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.167
Langston?

41:05.497 --> 41:09.070
Your record in
the city council is impeccable.

41:09.334 --> 41:10.404
Well, thank you.

41:10.669 --> 41:14.674
If you're not elected to
Congress, it won't be because of...

41:15.907 --> 41:18.581
insufficient financial support.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.785
I like that sound.

41:25.583 --> 41:26.926
Mr. Donaldson.

41:28.953 --> 41:32.799
I can't tell you how
much this means to me. Us.

41:34.259 --> 41:38.867
There is no reason you can't
do something for your people.

41:38.930 --> 41:42.776
You could do something really great.
Historic, maybe.

41:43.101 --> 41:45.274
I mean, we're talking the Obamas.

41:45.537 --> 41:46.880
The Williams sisters.

41:47.105 --> 41:50.109
And like Tiger Woods.

41:51.943 --> 41:53.445
Well, if, uh...

41:53.945 --> 41:56.619
you're referring to
the American people...

41:56.948 --> 41:59.053
then, yes, I have
every intention of

41:59.184 --> 42:01.289
making the American
people very proud.

42:01.553 --> 42:05.899
Well, I was thinking specifically
of your people, the black people.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.730
Well, I live in
Georgetown, so I guess

42:09.861 --> 42:11.966
these... these would be my people.

42:12.297 --> 42:16.143
And Tiger Woods lives in Florida,
so those would be his people.

42:16.468 --> 42:20.314
Are you saying that where
Tiger Woods lives...

42:20.638 --> 42:24.643
makes him irrelevant to
people of the same skin color?

42:24.976 --> 42:28.150
You'd first have to
determine Tiger Woods' skin color.

42:30.648 --> 42:31.991
He's black.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.658
Well, I think...

42:35.987 --> 42:38.763
what would make
Tiger Woods black...

42:39.090 --> 42:42.333
would be his
passion for things, uh, that...

42:42.827 --> 42:45.831
are related to the
African-American race as a whole.

42:46.097 --> 42:49.510
Which he has not yet proven to have.

42:55.607 --> 42:57.848
What I think would make
Tiger Woods black...

42:58.109 --> 43:01.454
is the fact he drives an Escalade
and his daddy's name is Earl.

43:17.729 --> 43:19.709
An Escalade? Why...

43:20.365 --> 43:21.708
A daddy named Earl?

43:22.033 --> 43:23.444
It was a joke.

43:23.501 --> 43:25.037
Things were getting heavy

43:25.103 --> 43:26.844
and I was just trying to lighten them up.

43:28.039 --> 43:29.109
Juicy, no!

43:33.645 --> 43:34.646
This is Langston.

43:35.046 --> 43:36.650
Good evening, sir.

43:37.549 --> 43:39.893
Yes, she is quite the funny lady.

43:41.886 --> 43:43.092
I'm sorry?

43:44.589 --> 43:46.591
Of course, I accept.

43:46.925 --> 43:48.927
Thank you again, sir.

43:49.327 --> 43:50.431
Good night.

43:52.263 --> 43:55.676
That was Mr. Donaldson.
He just doubled his contribution.

43:56.334 --> 43:59.178
Apparently your little
Tiger Woods joke...

43:59.437 --> 44:01.280
was the highlight
of his evening.

44:02.607 --> 44:03.847
Juicy! Go pee.

44:10.782 --> 44:15.458
Then the dinner was a success.
Langston, we should celebrate.

44:17.789 --> 44:18.961
Okay.

44:23.294 --> 44:24.637
Sweetheart.

44:26.464 --> 44:27.807
You're so pretty.

44:29.801 --> 44:31.144
There's a saying.

44:32.804 --> 44:35.148
Behind every great man...

44:35.473 --> 44:38.215
there is an even greater woman.

44:39.310 --> 44:42.154
I want that for you.
I want you to be greater.

44:42.480 --> 44:45.154
But sometimes being greater...

44:46.818 --> 44:48.320
means being quiet.

44:50.121 --> 44:51.122
Hmm.

44:51.489 --> 44:56.063
I always thought the saying
was, Beside every great man...

44:56.127 --> 45:00.098
Beside, behind, between...
it's all semantics. The point is...

45:00.164 --> 45:03.668
that if she is
to be great, wherever she is...

45:04.002 --> 45:08.348
she must follow.
And he must lead.

45:08.840 --> 45:11.514
Well, when I led...

45:12.010 --> 45:13.683
I got you twice as much money.

45:13.912 --> 45:16.188
- It's not just about money.
- What is it about?

45:16.414 --> 45:18.860
I'll tell you, Juicy.
I'm running for office.

45:19.083 --> 45:21.188
Did you just call me "Juicy"?

45:22.020 --> 45:24.364
- Did I?
- Yeah, you did.

45:24.856 --> 45:26.858
Well, I apologize.

45:27.091 --> 45:29.367
I don't know how I
could confuse you two,

45:29.494 --> 45:31.770
because Juicy knows how to obey.

45:32.030 --> 45:33.270
Juicy, come!

45:35.867 --> 45:37.210
See that?

45:38.102 --> 45:39.103
You know what?

45:39.537 --> 45:42.211
"New actions, new outcome."

45:42.540 --> 45:45.544
Same asshole, same outcome.

45:46.444 --> 45:47.946
You haven't changed a bit.

45:49.380 --> 45:52.884
And I'm keeping the outfit and
the shoes. I earned them.

45:56.888 --> 45:58.561
Get off, you little rat.

45:58.890 --> 46:00.233
Juicy.

46:02.060 --> 46:03.403
Juicy!

46:10.802 --> 46:11.837
Hello?

46:11.903 --> 46:14.406
Hey, it's me.
I didn't wake Taylor, did I?

46:14.639 --> 46:18.746
No. Her grandma got sick,
so she went out of town to see her.

46:18.977 --> 46:22.151
I'm sorry to hear that.
I hope she feels better.

46:22.747 --> 46:24.590
- You doing anything?
- Not anymore.

46:24.816 --> 46:25.920
Want to watch a movie?

46:28.086 --> 46:29.429
Sure.

46:29.921 --> 46:31.491
Great. Can you pick me up?

46:31.756 --> 46:33.167
You live across the hall.

46:33.424 --> 46:36.098
I'm not at home, silly.
I'm in Georgetown.

46:37.595 --> 46:38.596
Hello?

46:39.163 --> 46:40.335
William?

46:40.765 --> 46:41.937
Hello?

46:49.607 --> 46:50.608
Hello?

46:50.842 --> 46:52.844
Sorry. I guess we got cut off.

46:53.177 --> 46:54.281
No, I hung up.

46:56.614 --> 46:58.287
Yeah, sure, of course.

46:58.516 --> 47:00.962
I guess a 25-year
friendship doesn't give

47:01.085 --> 47:03.531
me the right to call
you or expect you...

47:03.788 --> 47:06.359
to drive less than an
hour when I'm stranded

47:06.457 --> 47:08.528
at midnight in the crime
capital of the world.

47:08.960 --> 47:13.204
Wait, stop, don't! I don't have any
money, or any real friends, either!

47:15.466 --> 47:16.809
Stop!

47:19.971 --> 47:21.314
So cold out there.

47:21.639 --> 47:23.482
Yeah? Comfortable?

47:27.578 --> 47:30.081
Why didn't you get one of your
friends to pick you up?

47:30.314 --> 47:34.160
Oh, that's right. He
lives in Chicago.

47:34.919 --> 47:36.262
Or was it Houston?

47:36.487 --> 47:38.831
No, no, no. New York City, right?

47:42.160 --> 47:45.004
I know this all seems
very silly to you.

47:45.263 --> 47:46.833
I'm sorry you had a rough night.

47:47.165 --> 47:49.338
It has been a very rough night.

47:50.001 --> 47:51.503
God, it's cold in here.

47:52.003 --> 47:55.849
Does "vintage" mean you don't
have any heat in this car?

47:57.008 --> 47:58.681
I'm so cold.

47:59.510 --> 48:02.514
Come sit next to me.
I'll keep you warm.

48:06.851 --> 48:08.125
Thank you for coming.

48:08.252 --> 48:09.526
You're welcome.

48:10.521 --> 48:14.025
You give me hope that there's
still some good men out there.

48:25.470 --> 48:27.541
Are you ever going to
finish this place?

48:27.805 --> 48:32.151
- It'll be finished...
- When it's finished, I know.

48:34.045 --> 48:37.390
I can't believe you're making me
watch a movie at two A.M.

48:37.882 --> 48:39.884
On VHS.

48:40.318 --> 48:41.729
All righty.

48:42.220 --> 48:43.893
Our choices.

48:44.555 --> 48:46.228
- Enter the Dragon.
- Uh-huh.

48:46.557 --> 48:48.400
Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.

48:48.893 --> 48:51.169
Or The Last Dragon. Whoo!

48:51.229 --> 48:52.230
You have Misery?

48:52.730 --> 48:54.073
The Last Dragon?

48:55.066 --> 48:58.741
There you go.
Get it started. I'll make us some drinks.

49:00.905 --> 49:02.350
Mo?

49:02.406 --> 49:05.910
What color in
the dining room? Cherry or Espresso?

49:06.244 --> 49:07.587
Espresso.

49:07.712 --> 49:09.089
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

49:09.347 --> 49:11.759
Wait. Is this our
high school yearbook?

49:12.250 --> 49:14.457
Yeah. My mom was cleaning
the garage and found it.

49:17.088 --> 49:20.092
I'm surprised your photo
didn't slide off the page.

49:22.093 --> 49:24.937
You'd be walking around
with that activator...

49:25.196 --> 49:28.040
Funny.
You must have forgot how you looked.

49:28.266 --> 49:31.770
There wasn't a tube of gel in a
thousand miles that was safe.

49:34.939 --> 49:37.283
Oh, my gosh. Look at our prom.

49:38.209 --> 49:40.052
We were gettin' down.

49:40.278 --> 49:43.953
No, I was getting dumped.
My date got jealous and left.

49:44.215 --> 49:46.627
It's not my fault
she couldn't dance.

49:47.785 --> 49:50.129
What was that song
we were dancing to?

49:59.730 --> 50:01.038
I don't love her

50:01.599 --> 50:03.510
I tried to tell myself

50:04.035 --> 50:07.039
But you can see it in my eyes

50:09.507 --> 50:10.679
So don't deny

50:11.442 --> 50:13.319
I can't fool no one else

50:13.778 --> 50:16.725
The truth is in the tears I cry

50:18.249 --> 50:20.092
Cause if it isn't love

50:20.284 --> 50:22.730
Why do I feel this way

50:23.054 --> 50:26.661
Why does she stay on my mind

50:27.992 --> 50:29.972
And if it isn't love

50:30.094 --> 50:33.507
Why does it hurt so bad

50:33.564 --> 50:37.603
Why does she stay on my mind

50:37.668 --> 50:39.477
If it isn't love

50:43.174 --> 50:44.847
Oh, my God.

50:46.177 --> 50:48.521
I'll get us a drink.
This is for you.

50:48.846 --> 50:50.018
- Thank you.
- Mmm-hmm.

50:51.015 --> 50:52.358
Here we go.

50:56.020 --> 50:57.693
This is a toast...

50:58.522 --> 51:00.763
to us never dancing...

51:00.825 --> 51:01.963
or dressing...

51:02.026 --> 51:03.334
like that ever again.

51:03.394 --> 51:04.395
Cheers.

51:07.198 --> 51:08.973
Know what else my mom found?

51:09.467 --> 51:13.040
Some DVD's? A couple romantic
comedies, hopefully?

51:13.304 --> 51:15.375
Stop talking about a
black man's mama.

51:19.710 --> 51:20.711
Remember this?

51:20.978 --> 51:23.390
Please don't tell me
you still have that.

51:23.648 --> 51:25.389
Paging Dr. William Wright.

51:27.051 --> 51:31.056
If not for this, you wouldn't have
known you had a heartbeat.

51:31.322 --> 51:33.199
You didn't know, either,
because you were

51:33.324 --> 51:35.429
always trying to put
it on my booty.

51:35.493 --> 51:37.495
You saying your booty
ain't got a heartbeat?

51:38.396 --> 51:39.500
I don't think it does.

51:39.630 --> 51:40.734
You don't?

51:41.065 --> 51:42.169
Let me check.

51:42.300 --> 51:43.404
Can you check it?

51:43.668 --> 51:44.840
Oh, my God.

51:45.069 --> 51:47.515
I can tell, young lady,
you're of African heritage.

51:47.905 --> 51:49.248
Thank you.

51:52.510 --> 51:53.853
I'm starting to hear something.

51:56.247 --> 51:58.693
Be glad you know a doctor
who makes house calls.

51:59.517 --> 52:01.087
Is that all you can make?

52:23.941 --> 52:25.113
William...

52:27.278 --> 52:28.450
Montana?

52:28.779 --> 52:29.951
William?

52:30.614 --> 52:32.287
Montana, we're here.

52:34.285 --> 52:36.128
We sure are.

52:46.297 --> 52:47.799
You still up for a movie?

52:58.309 --> 52:59.652
Mo, you forgot...

53:03.147 --> 53:05.491
She's always
forgetting something.

53:23.434 --> 53:24.435
Ahh!

53:25.503 --> 53:28.347
That was quite the dream you
were having, little girl.

53:29.173 --> 53:31.585
You were sleeping so
peacefully, I decided

53:31.709 --> 53:34.121
to clean that nasty
little kitchen of yours.

53:34.945 --> 53:39.189
The way a woman keeps her kitchen
is the way she keeps her man.

53:40.451 --> 53:41.623
I ought to know.

53:43.187 --> 53:44.359
Mom...

53:45.022 --> 53:47.366
in the interest of
me keeping my sanity...

53:47.691 --> 53:51.935
I think we should establish
some clear-cut boundaries.

53:52.029 --> 53:53.372
Boundaries.

53:53.864 --> 53:57.073
After 74-and-a-half hours in labor,

53:57.168 --> 53:58.647
struggling to give you life.

53:59.370 --> 54:01.043
This is how you thank me?

54:01.872 --> 54:04.876
Well, you're welcome.
And I am leaving.

54:06.710 --> 54:07.882
Mom?

54:10.214 --> 54:12.558
And do me a favor, Pig-pen.

54:12.883 --> 54:14.885
That funky little attitude you got?

54:15.019 --> 54:17.056
Don't bring that to
your sister's wedding.

54:17.388 --> 54:19.061
We don't need it, okay?

54:19.323 --> 54:20.324
Uh-huh.

54:22.893 --> 54:25.169
Maybe I want to have a
funky little attitude.

54:25.663 --> 54:29.076
Maybe because I'll have
someone of my own.

54:29.400 --> 54:31.641
And I'm bringing
him to the rehearsal dinner.

54:31.902 --> 54:33.245
What do you think about that?

54:35.406 --> 54:37.408
Really, Montana?

54:39.243 --> 54:40.916
You told your mother what?

54:41.178 --> 54:44.921
I had to get her
off my back. You know how she is.

54:45.182 --> 54:48.425
She got off your back, but a
10,000-pound gorilla jumped on.

54:48.752 --> 54:50.425
You'll see.

54:50.754 --> 54:52.097
- I'll see?
- You will.

54:52.423 --> 54:54.528
- Montana.
- Weisha!

54:54.592 --> 54:56.128
It's so good to see you.

54:56.260 --> 54:57.762
Good to see you.

54:58.095 --> 54:59.938
This is my good friend, William.

55:00.197 --> 55:01.870
Hello.

55:04.435 --> 55:06.608
For bridesmaid.

55:07.037 --> 55:08.038
Again.

55:09.607 --> 55:11.280
Try on.

55:11.609 --> 55:13.282
Thank you, Weisha.

55:13.611 --> 55:15.113
For the groom.

55:15.946 --> 55:17.050
Try on.

55:17.214 --> 55:19.091
Um, I'm not the groom.

55:19.450 --> 55:22.294
But you're same size as groom.
Try on.

55:22.620 --> 55:24.793
I need measurement.

55:29.960 --> 55:31.462
This could have been you.

55:31.695 --> 55:34.733
I proposed to you
and your answer was, "Eaugh!"

55:36.400 --> 55:39.904
You proposed to me in elementary
school during recess...

55:40.137 --> 55:41.912
"because you wanted my cupcake...

55:42.139 --> 55:44.312
and the only way to get it...

55:44.575 --> 55:47.647
was by giving me the toy ring
from your Cracker Jack box.

55:48.479 --> 55:50.322
At least I offered
you a ring for it.

55:50.414 --> 55:53.327
That's more than I can say for
the men you've dated since.

55:54.151 --> 55:59.157
Touche. If I had known the
proposals would be so infrequent...

55:59.490 --> 56:01.663
I would have accepted.

56:02.826 --> 56:04.499
And then we'd be married.

56:22.179 --> 56:23.522
Mo, you look amazing.

56:24.682 --> 56:27.026
You don't look half bad yourself.

56:35.025 --> 56:36.527
I have to get this.

56:38.462 --> 56:39.634
Taylor.

56:40.864 --> 56:42.969
How's your grandmother doing?

56:46.870 --> 56:48.474
I miss you, too.

56:52.576 --> 56:58.652
Got one... flight 1763 headed to
Houston, sitting in seat 3A.

56:58.716 --> 57:00.320
Houston, we got a problem!

57:00.551 --> 57:01.928
Move, move, move!

57:01.986 --> 57:03.659
Feet can't touch the ground

57:03.721 --> 57:05.496
And I can't hear a sound

57:05.756 --> 57:09.067
But you just keep on
running up your mouth, yeah

57:09.126 --> 57:11.970
Walk, walk on over there

57:12.029 --> 57:14.509
'Cause I'm too fly to care

57:14.565 --> 57:16.977
Oh, yeah

57:17.234 --> 57:20.738
He's on his way to D.C. Right
there with my President.

57:21.005 --> 57:23.918
This boy got some Frequent Flyer miles.
He's going to Miami.

57:24.241 --> 57:28.087
Got another one, Sam,
on his way to Detroit. Motown!

57:32.182 --> 57:33.525
Just one second.

57:33.751 --> 57:34.752
One minute, please.

57:34.885 --> 57:35.886
One second.

57:35.953 --> 57:39.594
Don't let what they say
keep you up at night

57:40.190 --> 57:46.402
And they can't detain you
'Cause wings are made to fly

57:46.630 --> 57:50.601
And we don't let
nobody bring us down

57:50.868 --> 57:54.111
No matter what you
say, it won't hurt me

57:54.838 --> 57:58.285
Don't matter if I fall from the sky

57:58.942 --> 58:01.752
These wings are made to fly

58:01.945 --> 58:03.117
She like light-skinned dudes?

58:03.380 --> 58:05.053
I got Leo DiCaprio up here.

58:05.282 --> 58:07.455
Do her husband have to be a man?

58:13.223 --> 58:16.227
Now is not the time to get
down on yourself, Montana.

58:16.627 --> 58:17.662
In a week, maybe.

58:19.029 --> 58:20.201
Thank you.

58:20.464 --> 58:22.137
Don't mention it.

58:22.533 --> 58:23.534
Ohh!

58:24.201 --> 58:25.475
Taylor?

58:26.303 --> 58:28.647
Montana. What a...

58:28.872 --> 58:29.873
Ho-ho-ho.

58:30.140 --> 58:31.210
Surprise?

58:32.476 --> 58:33.648
How's your grandmother?

58:38.546 --> 58:39.946
William is better looking.

58:40.148 --> 58:43.322
And he's a great guy.
And she's here being a two-timing...

58:43.551 --> 58:44.723
Whore.

58:46.721 --> 58:48.564
- Montana.
- Taylor.

58:48.823 --> 58:50.666
I know this looks really bad.

58:52.393 --> 58:55.237
But what you don't know is
me and William broke up.

58:55.496 --> 59:00.104
It's a long story. I'd appreciate
it if you don't mention it.

59:00.568 --> 59:04.243
You know how it is when you break up.
The wound's still open.

59:05.907 --> 59:07.409
Sure, yeah.

59:08.743 --> 59:10.086
Thank you.

59:12.914 --> 59:15.918
Could you get me a hot tea?
Two sugars, no cream.

59:17.351 --> 59:18.591
Ciao!

59:23.191 --> 59:27.435
Flight 901 is headed to New Mexico.
Feliz Navidad.

59:29.597 --> 59:32.271
Got another one, Sam, 506...

59:32.533 --> 59:35.707
coming straight
to Los Angeles. You want him?

59:39.373 --> 59:41.944
Do you mind if I...
Sorry, I'm really sorry.

59:45.112 --> 59:46.284
Sorry.

01:00:11.973 --> 01:00:15.978
No, Gail, there's
four days left before the wedding.

01:00:16.644 --> 01:00:19.318
I'm just going to get
some rest and...

01:00:19.647 --> 01:00:21.820
hop on the first
flight in the morning.

01:00:22.817 --> 01:00:24.319
Thanks for trying.

01:00:25.319 --> 01:00:27.663
Yeah. I love you, too.

01:00:28.322 --> 01:00:30.666
Okay. Bye.

01:00:49.777 --> 01:00:52.519
Montana Moore.
Do you know what time it is?

01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:54.350
It's ten o'clock in L.A.

01:00:54.615 --> 01:00:56.617
it's one A.M. in Baltimore.

01:00:58.219 --> 01:00:59.562
I know.

01:00:59.887 --> 01:01:02.891
I'm sorry, I just thought
maybe you might want to...

01:01:03.224 --> 01:01:04.567
you know...

01:01:05.126 --> 01:01:06.127
talk.

01:01:07.295 --> 01:01:08.296
About?

01:01:08.563 --> 01:01:10.236
Come on, William.

01:01:10.565 --> 01:01:14.069
How long have we
known each other? You can tell me.

01:01:14.302 --> 01:01:15.406
What are you talking about?

01:01:15.636 --> 01:01:16.637
I'm talking about...

01:01:17.305 --> 01:01:18.409
Montana.

01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:20.141
Taylor.

01:01:20.207 --> 01:01:21.407
I was thinking about you, too.

01:01:22.076 --> 01:01:23.646
Oh, you got another call.

01:01:23.878 --> 01:01:25.448
Taylor, don't do that.

01:01:25.746 --> 01:01:28.420
And Merry Christmas to you, too.
Bye.

01:01:28.749 --> 01:01:30.751
What happened to the Italian guy?

01:01:38.926 --> 01:01:40.269
What are you working on?

01:01:41.929 --> 01:01:43.931
Just trying to figure things out.

01:01:45.266 --> 01:01:47.268
I like this little thing here.

01:01:47.602 --> 01:01:48.945
Oh. yeah?

01:02:10.458 --> 01:02:12.028
Anybody in a holiday spirit?

01:02:12.293 --> 01:02:14.136
Come on, it's open mike.

01:02:16.297 --> 01:02:18.337
A cottage small is all I'm after

01:02:18.733 --> 01:02:22.044
Not one that's spacious and wide.

01:02:22.570 --> 01:02:24.311
A house that's filled...

01:02:24.472 --> 01:02:26.645
What are you guys whispering about?

01:02:26.974 --> 01:02:29.818
Hey, I'm singing right now.

01:02:32.146 --> 01:02:34.990
Sam e people like the high life.
I like the low life.

01:02:38.052 --> 01:02:42.660
Sounds corny and seedy,
but yes, indeed-y,

01:02:42.823 --> 01:02:46.635
Give me the simple life

01:02:48.329 --> 01:02:50.172
You know? Okay.

01:02:52.166 --> 01:02:55.511
Bravo, bravo. That was amazing.

01:02:55.736 --> 01:02:57.010
Quinton!

01:02:57.838 --> 01:02:59.181
Montana.

01:03:00.408 --> 01:03:01.751
Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

01:03:02.009 --> 01:03:04.353
Oh, please. Don't be.

01:03:05.179 --> 01:03:06.522
You were wonderful.

01:03:06.847 --> 01:03:08.849
- Really?
- Well, no.

01:03:11.852 --> 01:03:13.525
it's so good to see you.

01:03:13.854 --> 01:03:16.858
You, too. I'm so pleased
you still remember me.

01:03:17.091 --> 01:03:21.096
Of course I remember you. You
were on my route for over a year.

01:03:21.362 --> 01:03:24.536
L.A. to New York.
Let me see if I can remember.

01:03:24.765 --> 01:03:27.871
Columbia graduate,
top of your class, of course.

01:03:28.202 --> 01:03:32.378
Hobbies-racquetball,
skiing and art.

01:03:32.707 --> 01:03:36.712
I guess it's obvious how much I enjoyed
talking to you during our flights.

01:03:36.944 --> 01:03:40.790
Luckily, there was always an empty
seat next to you so we could talk.

01:03:41.048 --> 01:03:43.892
It wasn't luck.
I paid for both seats.

01:03:44.785 --> 01:03:46.059
You didn't.

01:03:46.287 --> 01:03:47.630
Of course.

01:03:49.390 --> 01:03:50.562
Excuse me.

01:03:58.232 --> 01:04:00.906
I have no idea
what you just said, but you don't...

01:04:01.135 --> 01:04:02.808
Please. I insist.

01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:04.913
Let's go have a drink.

01:04:05.239 --> 01:04:07.082
Okay, if you insist.

01:04:08.909 --> 01:04:11.412
So you've been a maid
of honor nine times.

01:04:11.912 --> 01:04:14.415
I should call
the Guinness Book of World Records.

01:04:14.648 --> 01:04:16.650
More like Ripley's
Believe It or Not.

01:04:16.917 --> 01:04:19.420
It could have been ten, actually...

01:04:19.653 --> 01:04:22.133
but my cousin called off her
third wedding the day before.

01:04:22.189 --> 01:04:24.465
So it's really nine
with an asterisk.

01:04:25.593 --> 01:04:26.765
Yeah, I know.

01:04:26.994 --> 01:04:28.837
As you requested, Mr. Jamison.

01:04:29.096 --> 01:04:31.269
Oh, Quinton, this is too much.

01:04:31.499 --> 01:04:35.675
You can never have too much of a good
thing. Besides, it's on the house.

01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:38.614
You work for the hotel?

01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.113
I own the hotel.

01:04:44.612 --> 01:04:45.955
This hotel?

01:04:46.947 --> 01:04:47.948
Yes.

01:04:50.384 --> 01:04:55.265
It's a lovely day for going nowhere

01:04:59.160 --> 01:05:04.508
It's a lovely day for being in love

01:05:08.068 --> 01:05:14.451
It's a lovely day
Feel like chasing the clouds away

01:05:17.044 --> 01:05:22.858
To a perfect place I'm dreaming of

01:05:26.687 --> 01:05:31.830
It's a lovely day for going nowhere

01:05:35.496 --> 01:05:38.670
Have you ever imagined
what it would feel like...

01:05:38.999 --> 01:05:42.344
to take off a year
and travel the world?

01:05:43.504 --> 01:05:47.850
What woman hasn't?
But without the means or the time...

01:05:48.342 --> 01:05:51.687
it remains just that,
a thought, a dream.

01:05:53.848 --> 01:05:56.351
So if you were given the means...

01:05:57.184 --> 01:05:59.027
would you find the time?

01:06:01.021 --> 01:06:03.194
I don't know what you mean.

01:06:05.192 --> 01:06:06.193
Oh.

01:06:07.194 --> 01:06:09.538
You think this sunrise is beautiful?

01:06:10.865 --> 01:06:13.038
Wait till you
see the sunrise in the Serengeti.

01:06:13.534 --> 01:06:16.208
Or the view from the top
of the Eiffel Tower.

01:06:17.037 --> 01:06:19.039
We could shop in Milan.

01:06:19.273 --> 01:06:21.776
Cruise the Greek Isles
on a private yacht.

01:06:22.543 --> 01:06:26.218
Wow, that... that sounds incredible.

01:06:27.882 --> 01:06:30.726
Quinton, I'm so flattered.
I don't know what to say.

01:06:30.951 --> 01:06:34.057
Say... "I accept your invitation."

01:06:34.388 --> 01:06:37.062
You mean... your proposal?

01:06:38.058 --> 01:06:40.231
If that's what you want
to call it, then yes.

01:06:40.628 --> 01:06:42.630
What do you want me to call it?

01:06:43.397 --> 01:06:45.604
I'm taking time off
to travel the world

01:06:45.666 --> 01:06:47.145
and I'm asking you to join me.

01:06:50.237 --> 01:06:51.409
Montana...

01:06:51.739 --> 01:06:54.242
if you thought
I was talking about marriage

01:06:54.575 --> 01:06:56.748
I've tried it, twice...

01:06:57.077 --> 01:07:00.081
and all it did
was ruin two very good friendships.

01:07:01.615 --> 01:07:02.616
Listen.

01:07:02.917 --> 01:07:05.124
If marriage is what
you need, you should

01:07:05.252 --> 01:07:07.425
find someone willing
to give you that.

01:07:07.755 --> 01:07:10.292
But if passion and
adventure are what you want,

01:07:10.624 --> 01:07:12.763
you'll never want it again.

01:07:15.996 --> 01:07:17.998
I'm passing through D.C.
in a couple of days

01:07:18.132 --> 01:07:20.373
on my way to Rome, then London...

01:07:20.434 --> 01:07:22.107
and then to Greece.

01:07:22.436 --> 01:07:24.040
I'll have my assistant book you

01:07:24.171 --> 01:07:25.851
a ticket to all three places,
just in case.

01:07:28.442 --> 01:07:29.785
Okay.

01:07:31.445 --> 01:07:33.789
If you're going to be in D.C...

01:07:34.114 --> 01:07:37.118
I'd really like you to come
to my sister's rehearsal dinner.

01:07:37.451 --> 01:07:40.625
If won't be anything fancy,
like you're used to, but...

01:07:41.288 --> 01:07:42.858
we could talk about it then.

01:07:43.123 --> 01:07:44.363
Okay.

01:07:46.293 --> 01:07:50.298
Now you get some rest
and think about it. Yes?

01:07:52.466 --> 01:07:53.809
Okay.

01:07:59.139 --> 01:08:00.982
It's been a great night.

01:08:38.511 --> 01:08:42.688
Now I realize why it's
so hard to find the perfect guy.

01:08:43.517 --> 01:08:46.361
Maybe he just doesn't exist.

01:08:54.661 --> 01:08:59.201
From the first time we met

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:03.814
Saw a glow I can't forget

01:09:04.071 --> 01:09:08.314
Felt the sun rise and set

01:09:08.776 --> 01:09:13.225
In your eyes

01:09:14.014 --> 01:09:18.359
I knew that I wanted

01:09:18.585 --> 01:09:22.055
You near me

01:09:22.356 --> 01:09:26.532
Is it love I feel?

01:09:27.060 --> 01:09:31.510
Tell me, is it real?

01:09:31.932 --> 01:09:38.816
Is it love, please tell me

01:09:41.675 --> 01:09:44.417
Now

01:09:49.917 --> 01:09:50.917
What you doing?

01:09:50.984 --> 01:09:54.090
About to
get ready for the rehearsal dinner.

01:09:54.321 --> 01:09:55.823
It's your mailman.

01:09:57.091 --> 01:09:58.365
From your mailbox.

01:09:58.492 --> 01:09:59.766
You didn't have to do that.

01:10:03.764 --> 01:10:05.266
And that's from me.

01:10:06.166 --> 01:10:07.839
Early Christmas gift.

01:10:08.168 --> 01:10:09.272
Thanks.

01:10:09.403 --> 01:10:10.507
It'll help get your
mother off your back.

01:10:10.771 --> 01:10:12.444
That's no longer a problem.

01:10:12.673 --> 01:10:14.448
Tonight at Sheree's
rehearsal dinner,

01:10:14.508 --> 01:10:17.455
after my sister
introduces her soon-to-be husband...

01:10:17.845 --> 01:10:20.018
I'll make an
introduction of my own.

01:10:21.348 --> 01:10:22.452
What's so funny?

01:10:22.683 --> 01:10:24.356
You're turning into your mother.

01:10:24.618 --> 01:10:28.964
No. I'm just realizing that maybe
fairy tales don't come true.

01:10:29.623 --> 01:10:33.799
We weren't all lucky enough
to have parents like you...

01:10:34.128 --> 01:10:38.133
that ate dinner every night
together for 40 years.

01:10:38.532 --> 01:10:40.842
I never said my
parents were perfect.

01:10:40.934 --> 01:10:43.210
They went through
it just like any other couple.

01:10:43.470 --> 01:10:46.644
But when they took those
vows, they meant it.

01:10:46.974 --> 01:10:49.978
My mom loved my dad.
And my dad loved her back.

01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:53.054
Well, my mom loved my dad.

01:10:53.313 --> 01:10:55.020
And then she loved another man.

01:10:55.149 --> 01:10:57.527
And another man and another man.

01:10:57.818 --> 01:11:01.664
People get married and divorced.
That's just what people do.

01:11:01.889 --> 01:11:04.995
You spent your life being your own
woman. Why change now?

01:11:05.325 --> 01:11:07.828
Who said I wouldn't be my own woman?

01:11:07.895 --> 01:11:11.001
I just would really like to
be somebody else's, too.

01:11:11.331 --> 01:11:13.834
Somebody's? Or anybody's?

01:11:18.172 --> 01:11:20.516
You know what? William...

01:11:22.009 --> 01:11:25.513
why don't you save your
really great relationship advice

01:11:25.746 --> 01:11:29.091
for someone
who really needs it? Like Taylor...

01:11:29.349 --> 01:11:31.920
when she's kissing some
Italian dude at 30,000 feet.

01:11:33.687 --> 01:11:34.927
Wow.

01:11:36.590 --> 01:11:37.694
That's my cue.

01:11:40.694 --> 01:11:42.196
Merry Christmas, Mo.

01:11:44.865 --> 01:11:46.276
I thought you should know!

01:11:47.601 --> 01:11:49.274
Thank you, I know.

01:11:52.372 --> 01:11:53.373
William?

01:11:59.446 --> 01:12:01.050
I'm sorry.

01:12:14.394 --> 01:12:16.237
Montana, it's your mother.

01:12:16.563 --> 01:12:20.409
I have told everybody
about your announcement...

01:12:20.734 --> 01:12:22.736
so don't let me down!

01:12:42.589 --> 01:12:44.432
Good evening.

01:12:44.758 --> 01:12:47.602
As you all know,
my youngest daughter...

01:12:47.928 --> 01:12:51.273
is marrying a
handsome young man...

01:12:51.598 --> 01:12:53.271
from Rhoda Island.

01:12:53.533 --> 01:12:55.376
Rocky Mountains.

01:12:55.435 --> 01:12:56.607
Rocky Mountains.

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.283
What are you doing here?

01:13:01.608 --> 01:13:03.610
Same as you, just being nosy.

01:13:03.877 --> 01:13:05.879
This is to welcome
him to the family.

01:13:06.613 --> 01:13:09.457
And give him a last
chance to back out.

01:13:11.285 --> 01:13:14.459
But before I bring you
my youngest daughter...

01:13:14.788 --> 01:13:16.961
I'd like to present my oldest...

01:13:17.791 --> 01:13:20.965
who has an announcement
that is lovely...

01:13:22.129 --> 01:13:23.802
and long overdue.

01:13:24.398 --> 01:13:26.639
I give you Montana!

01:13:27.401 --> 01:13:29.142
Montana, come up.

01:13:29.469 --> 01:13:30.743
Come up here.

01:13:37.978 --> 01:13:39.821
So, um...

01:13:41.148 --> 01:13:43.150
...I have an announcement..

01:13:43.483 --> 01:13:46.657
...as I am sure you are all aware.

01:13:47.321 --> 01:13:50.666
The tricky thing about
announcements is...

01:13:51.158 --> 01:13:53.832
you need to have
something to announce...

01:13:54.094 --> 01:13:56.597
in order for it to
be an announcement.

01:13:57.831 --> 01:13:59.174
What is she doing?

01:13:59.433 --> 01:14:00.434
I don't know.

01:14:02.002 --> 01:14:03.845
So, here it is.

01:14:04.171 --> 01:14:07.118
Friends... family...
fellow Americans.

01:14:07.341 --> 01:14:08.342
Langston.

01:14:08.775 --> 01:14:09.896
Langston?

01:14:10.844 --> 01:14:13.848
Montana, I was flipping
through the newspaper...

01:14:14.114 --> 01:14:17.459
and saw the notice
for your sister's wedding.

01:14:17.684 --> 01:14:20.358
Congratulations.
You look ravishing.

01:14:20.687 --> 01:14:21.961
Thank you.

01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:23.869
- Montana...
- Who is he?

01:14:24.024 --> 01:14:26.630
I thought about what you said.
You were right.

01:14:26.860 --> 01:14:29.204
A woman can lead.

01:14:29.796 --> 01:14:31.639
Under the right
circumstances, of course.

01:14:32.532 --> 01:14:34.944
One of which is a campaign brunch

01:14:35.068 --> 01:14:37.480
next week, with a very
influential senator.

01:14:38.205 --> 01:14:39.878
A senator.

01:14:40.307 --> 01:14:42.548
This is to beside...

01:14:43.009 --> 01:14:44.010
behind...

01:14:45.879 --> 01:14:47.552
and to nothing...

01:14:48.148 --> 01:14:49.650
coming between us.

01:14:55.555 --> 01:14:56.727
Montana...

01:14:57.891 --> 01:14:59.837
would you...
- Oh, yes, she will!

01:15:00.727 --> 01:15:02.729
No, I won't.

01:15:03.063 --> 01:15:04.906
- Yes, you will.
- I won't.

01:15:05.165 --> 01:15:06.508
- Will.
- Won't.

01:15:06.733 --> 01:15:08.406
What's gotten into you?

01:15:08.668 --> 01:15:09.840
What's gotten into you?

01:15:10.737 --> 01:15:12.739
You don't even know this man.

01:15:13.407 --> 01:15:15.512
- Hi.
- Hello. How are you?

01:15:15.575 --> 01:15:16.576
Fine, thank you.

01:15:16.843 --> 01:15:21.019
You're just going to marry me off
to the first person you see?

01:15:21.581 --> 01:15:23.254
Unbelievable.

01:15:24.584 --> 01:15:26.757
This is a man...

01:15:27.087 --> 01:15:28.589
who I would...

01:15:29.189 --> 01:15:30.190
never marry.

01:15:32.759 --> 01:15:34.432
I wouldn't even vote for you.

01:15:36.096 --> 01:15:38.940
I don't trust black
Republicans, I'm sorry.

01:15:39.933 --> 01:15:41.276
I'm actually a Libertarian.

01:15:41.535 --> 01:15:45.540
You know, I spent the
last thirty days...

01:15:46.606 --> 01:15:49.109
looking for somebody, anybody...

01:15:49.443 --> 01:15:51.116
to come here tonight.

01:15:51.445 --> 01:15:54.119
So I could... fit in.

01:15:55.115 --> 01:15:56.890
Be part of the club.

01:15:58.118 --> 01:16:01.964
So all of you would say,
"We love you, Montana."

01:16:02.289 --> 01:16:05.793
"You did it. We're so proud of you.
You're a lady."

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.732
But...

01:16:08.128 --> 01:16:09.971
marriage doesn't
make you a lady...

01:16:10.297 --> 01:16:14.803
any more than standing in
a garage makes you a car.

01:16:16.136 --> 01:16:17.809
That's a weird analogy.

01:16:19.639 --> 01:16:20.982
So, um...

01:16:22.142 --> 01:16:24.144
where's my announcement.

01:16:25.078 --> 01:16:26.318
I'm not getting married.

01:16:27.914 --> 01:16:29.416
I don't even have any prospects.

01:16:29.983 --> 01:16:32.156
No, none, zero.

01:16:32.419 --> 01:16:33.762
I'm all alone.

01:16:35.989 --> 01:16:38.333
But I did meet somebody...

01:16:38.825 --> 01:16:41.829
have been really,
really needing to meet.

01:16:43.663 --> 01:16:44.835
Me.

01:16:48.168 --> 01:16:49.772
And it turns out...

01:16:51.838 --> 01:16:53.511
I like me.

01:16:55.342 --> 01:16:56.685
A lot.

01:16:57.511 --> 01:16:59.787
With or without a husband.

01:17:03.016 --> 01:17:07.021
And I say this, from
your older sister...

01:17:07.954 --> 01:17:09.126
that...

01:17:10.357 --> 01:17:14.032
if you are really in
love with Derrick...

01:17:14.528 --> 01:17:16.132
and you can't imagine...

01:17:16.196 --> 01:17:19.040
spending another
day without him...

01:17:19.533 --> 01:17:22.139
then you two should
absolutely get married.

01:17:22.702 --> 01:17:25.205
And I'm so happy for you.

01:17:26.473 --> 01:17:27.474
But...

01:17:28.708 --> 01:17:32.053
if you're making this
decision for any other reason...

01:17:32.546 --> 01:17:36.221
sweetie, you're making the
biggest mistake of your life.

01:17:42.222 --> 01:17:45.066
A really good friend once told me...

01:17:46.893 --> 01:17:48.236
the magic...

01:17:48.895 --> 01:17:52.069
the magic isn't
in getting married.

01:17:53.333 --> 01:17:54.903
It's in staying married.

01:18:03.577 --> 01:18:04.578
I don't know.

01:18:07.247 --> 01:18:10.421
What are you saying?
You don't want to get married?

01:18:10.684 --> 01:18:12.027
Do you?

01:18:12.919 --> 01:18:15.923
I was just doing
this 'cause your mom said we had to.

01:18:19.593 --> 01:18:23.268
Baby, we can wait until
after we graduate.

01:18:23.597 --> 01:18:26.703
Maybe get to
know each other a little better.

01:18:27.601 --> 01:18:28.944
Are you sure?

01:18:30.770 --> 01:18:32.443
Yes. I am.

01:18:32.772 --> 01:18:34.274
That's okay. Give me a kiss.

01:18:35.942 --> 01:18:38.115
- I'm fine with that. I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:18:38.945 --> 01:18:40.618
I feel so much better.

01:18:41.448 --> 01:18:42.791
Let's get out of here.

01:18:46.453 --> 01:18:47.796
Thank you.

01:18:48.288 --> 01:18:49.460
I love you.

01:19:00.967 --> 01:19:04.813
Hello. My name is Langston
Jefferson Battle Ill...

01:19:05.071 --> 01:19:08.143
and I am running for
the United States Congress.

01:19:10.610 --> 01:19:13.454
You met someone? You met yourself?

01:19:14.447 --> 01:19:17.121
I had to say I was
introducing someone.

01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:23.524
Whatever you need, we are here
for you. Right by your side.

01:19:24.124 --> 01:19:25.296
Montana!

01:19:25.458 --> 01:19:26.801
From way over there.

01:19:27.027 --> 01:19:28.870
Way, way over there.

01:19:29.129 --> 01:19:30.472
Wait for me, okay?

01:19:30.797 --> 01:19:31.798
Not now, Mom.

01:19:31.931 --> 01:19:33.239
Montana, wait.

01:19:33.299 --> 01:19:37.304
Listen, Mom. I need a few
days. Weeks. Maybe even a month.

01:19:37.537 --> 01:19:40.040
I can't give you that.

01:19:41.474 --> 01:19:44.819
I can risk losing another
husband, but not my daughter.

01:19:48.481 --> 01:19:50.483
I was proud of you in there.

01:19:52.819 --> 01:19:56.665
That woman in there was the
woman I raised you to be.

01:19:57.490 --> 01:19:59.834
Confident. Smart.

01:20:00.326 --> 01:20:01.828
Independent.

01:20:02.829 --> 01:20:04.172
A lady.

01:20:11.004 --> 01:20:12.677
I'm sorry.

01:20:13.506 --> 01:20:15.349
I was scared.

01:20:18.745 --> 01:20:21.419
I put all that pressure
on you and your sister...

01:20:21.681 --> 01:20:25.754
'cause I didn't want you to go
through five husbands like I did.

01:20:26.186 --> 01:20:27.256
Do you mean that?

01:20:27.387 --> 01:20:28.422
Of course I do.

01:20:29.522 --> 01:20:31.365
And you know I do.

01:20:32.358 --> 01:20:35.430
I don't know if I
ever told you this...

01:20:38.865 --> 01:20:40.776
but your father...

01:20:42.368 --> 01:20:44.041
was my first...

01:20:45.038 --> 01:20:46.711
and only...

01:20:48.208 --> 01:20:49.551
true love...

01:20:51.544 --> 01:20:53.217
And I loved him...

01:20:53.713 --> 01:20:55.715
until the day he died.

01:20:57.217 --> 01:20:59.629
You're too young to
remember, Montana.

01:20:59.886 --> 01:21:03.561
But every Sunday,
your father would let me sleep.

01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:06.234
He'd rush downstairs...

01:21:06.559 --> 01:21:08.232
to make pancakes.

01:21:08.895 --> 01:21:12.809
He'd rattle his pots and pans
and carry on down there.

01:21:13.900 --> 01:21:15.777
And then he'd yell up the stairs,

01:21:15.835 --> 01:21:18.907
"Catherine, you come on down
here and eat these pancakes!"

01:21:20.406 --> 01:21:21.680
I wouldn't move.

01:21:23.243 --> 01:21:26.588
And then he'd come
and kiss me on my cheek.

01:21:28.248 --> 01:21:30.592
So sweet.

01:21:33.753 --> 01:21:36.427
And he'd say,
"Get up, baby. Come and eat."

01:21:41.594 --> 01:21:43.767
That was thirty years ago, Montana.

01:21:46.766 --> 01:21:48.768
And some Sundays...

01:21:49.602 --> 01:21:51.946
I still close my eyes...

01:21:52.772 --> 01:21:56.345
and I can smell those
pancakes like it was yesterday.

01:21:59.612 --> 01:22:00.613
So, yeah.

01:22:01.281 --> 01:22:03.625
Love does matter.

01:22:07.954 --> 01:22:09.956
And when you find love...

01:22:11.624 --> 01:22:12.967
and you will, baby...

01:22:13.293 --> 01:22:14.636
No, no.

01:22:17.463 --> 01:22:19.136
Don't ever let it go.

01:22:28.308 --> 01:22:29.309
I love you, Mom.

01:22:29.442 --> 01:22:30.477
I love you, too.

01:22:34.147 --> 01:22:35.148
Mom.

01:22:35.215 --> 01:22:36.216
Come on, let's go.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.823
I just want to make you proud of me.

01:22:45.391 --> 01:22:47.837
I don't think I'm
ever going to meet somebody.

01:22:48.061 --> 01:22:51.565
Who knows? But you can have
really great sex while you look.

01:22:53.166 --> 01:22:54.167
She can.

01:22:54.400 --> 01:22:56.573
We get it, Gail. You like to bone.

01:23:08.848 --> 01:23:10.020
Montana!

01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:12.491
Did you enter the Publisher's
Clearing House Sweepstakes?

01:23:16.256 --> 01:23:18.031
Who is that?

01:23:18.691 --> 01:23:19.863
Montana!

01:23:20.093 --> 01:23:24.098
Montana, I think the King of
Zamunda might be here to see you.

01:23:29.669 --> 01:23:31.774
Oh. That's Quinton.

01:23:32.939 --> 01:23:34.384
That is Quinton.

01:23:34.607 --> 01:23:37.281
That's who you were supposed
to meet at the rehearsal?

01:23:37.877 --> 01:23:39.550
That's the one that gave you...

01:23:39.879 --> 01:23:41.222
Those diamonds are...

01:23:41.714 --> 01:23:43.216
Those diamonds are real?

01:23:43.549 --> 01:23:44.823
Montana!

01:23:46.386 --> 01:23:48.297
Get ready, go down there.

01:23:48.554 --> 01:23:50.056
No. I'm not.

01:23:50.290 --> 01:23:51.462
What are you doing?

01:23:51.591 --> 01:23:52.797
Gail, move.

01:23:53.059 --> 01:23:54.129
Put the bracelet down.

01:23:54.394 --> 01:23:55.600
Let her go.

01:23:55.728 --> 01:23:57.208
Don't do something
we will all regret!

01:23:57.897 --> 01:23:59.740
We can all retire off that bracelet!

01:24:01.734 --> 01:24:02.906
Quinton!

01:24:04.737 --> 01:24:09.083
I apologize for being late. I had an
event that ran longer than expected.

01:24:09.309 --> 01:24:11.311
I hope I didn't ruin
anything for you.

01:24:13.246 --> 01:24:16.591
Look. I thought
about what you said in Los Angeles.

01:24:16.816 --> 01:24:18.227
I said a lot.

01:24:18.351 --> 01:24:19.762
And I listened.

01:24:21.587 --> 01:24:25.262
I want more than
extravagant trips and...

01:24:25.758 --> 01:24:27.601
expensive gifts.

01:24:27.927 --> 01:24:31.101
They're nice. They're really nice.

01:24:32.265 --> 01:24:33.266
But...

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:35.773
I want a lifetime.

01:24:36.502 --> 01:24:41.451
And as silly as it may sound, I'm not
going to settle for anything less.

01:24:42.775 --> 01:24:45.119
And as silly as it sounds...

01:24:45.945 --> 01:24:47.288
I don't think you should.

01:24:52.285 --> 01:24:53.355
Thanks.

01:24:58.124 --> 01:25:00.468
I can't see! I can't see!

01:25:12.472 --> 01:25:13.576
That was super brave.

01:25:13.706 --> 01:25:14.810
Thanks.

01:25:15.141 --> 01:25:17.485
That was super stupid.

01:25:20.613 --> 01:25:21.614
Uh, uh, uh!

01:25:23.983 --> 01:25:24.984
I just...

01:25:26.652 --> 01:25:29.326
I want a commitment. Real love.

01:25:29.655 --> 01:25:33.000
He just wanted international
travel booty.

01:25:33.326 --> 01:25:37.172
That man could have
intergalactic travel booty.

01:25:39.165 --> 01:25:40.769
So who gave you this?

01:25:40.900 --> 01:25:42.504
William.

01:25:42.835 --> 01:25:44.678
Did William wrap that himself?

01:25:45.571 --> 01:25:46.982
He can wrap a gift.

01:25:47.340 --> 01:25:48.341
You going to open it?

01:25:48.841 --> 01:25:49.842
No.

01:25:49.909 --> 01:25:50.944
Okay, I will.

01:25:51.077 --> 01:25:54.251
Hey, hey. She said she
doesn't want to open it.

01:25:54.414 --> 01:25:56.189
That's why I'm opening it.

01:25:56.416 --> 01:25:57.759
- You want it?
- Yes.

01:25:58.017 --> 01:25:59.052
I would.

01:25:59.185 --> 01:26:00.186
Don't you touch my...!

01:26:00.420 --> 01:26:01.763
I'll open it!

01:26:02.021 --> 01:26:05.025
God! I have had enough
drama for one night.

01:26:05.258 --> 01:26:07.260
- You said you didn't want to open it.
- Stop it!

01:26:07.527 --> 01:26:08.938
I'll open it.

01:26:14.967 --> 01:26:15.968
Really.

01:26:24.877 --> 01:26:27.551
Is William going through a bit
of a financial situation?

01:26:29.882 --> 01:26:34.558
When we were seven, he proposed
to me with a toy ring...

01:26:36.055 --> 01:26:37.728
and I laughed at him.

01:26:38.891 --> 01:26:41.394
And he said, "Someday."

01:26:44.564 --> 01:26:45.907
it's a plane ticket.

01:26:46.132 --> 01:26:47.975
Is it? Hey, now.

01:26:51.137 --> 01:26:53.811
Okay.
This is a plane ticket to France.

01:26:56.476 --> 01:26:58.649
He wants you to marry a Frenchman.

01:26:58.911 --> 01:26:59.912
Gail.

01:27:00.913 --> 01:27:03.359
He was going to take his
girlfriend to Italy

01:27:03.483 --> 01:27:05.929
for their one-year
anniversary and I said...

01:27:06.252 --> 01:27:10.598
if it was me,
I would have chosen... France.

01:27:13.826 --> 01:27:15.931
What date is the ticket for?

01:27:18.598 --> 01:27:19.941
Today.

01:27:22.101 --> 01:27:23.671
At 11:45 P.M.

01:27:25.938 --> 01:27:28.282
Here we go, looking for a taxi!

01:27:28.774 --> 01:27:30.117
That one!

01:27:30.343 --> 01:27:31.464
Stop in the name of the law!

01:27:32.612 --> 01:27:33.955
We need to get to the airport!

01:27:34.180 --> 01:27:35.625
I'm off duty!

01:27:36.182 --> 01:27:37.354
What are you doing?

01:27:37.483 --> 01:27:38.621
Sir, you must!

01:27:41.954 --> 01:27:45.197
Hey, my brother, I'm Calvin.
Let me help you with your bag.

01:27:45.258 --> 01:27:46.396
I'm good, bro.

01:27:46.459 --> 01:27:49.804
You can't go in there with
liquids and gels. You got any?

01:27:50.029 --> 01:27:51.702
Cabbie, cabbie!

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:55.543
Stop!

01:27:56.302 --> 01:27:58.646
Brother, you don't have
no lotion or nothing?

01:27:58.704 --> 01:27:59.808
No, I don't.

01:27:59.872 --> 01:28:03.479
So you out here for the
holidays just ashy?

01:28:03.709 --> 01:28:06.815
You already dark-skinned.
Brother, we got a black President.

01:28:07.046 --> 01:28:09.993
I am not sitting bitch!
I resent the implication!

01:28:10.316 --> 01:28:12.318
I want the seat by the window!

01:28:12.552 --> 01:28:14.054
Happy holidays, brother.

01:28:18.324 --> 01:28:19.667
I couldn't hold him.

01:28:19.992 --> 01:28:21.835
Drive, drive, drive!

01:28:23.329 --> 01:28:24.330
How may I help you, sir?

01:28:24.463 --> 01:28:25.498
I'm going to Paris.

01:28:25.698 --> 01:28:26.699
I need your passport.

01:28:27.233 --> 01:28:28.576
Here you go.

01:28:29.835 --> 01:28:33.180
Calvin couldn't stop him.
I'll text Tanya and Cedric.

01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:36.683
Here you go.

01:28:39.245 --> 01:28:40.349
Actually!

01:28:40.580 --> 01:28:45.256
These computers are always doing
something weird. Just one second.

01:28:45.518 --> 01:28:46.656
Enjoying the holidays?

01:28:46.719 --> 01:28:47.754
Is it snowing?

01:28:47.853 --> 01:28:49.992
Paris sounds amazing.
Is the Eiffel Tower there?

01:28:57.930 --> 01:28:59.773
I'm stuck here!

01:29:00.032 --> 01:29:01.072
Where are you going?

01:29:01.100 --> 01:29:02.101
I have to try!

01:29:02.602 --> 01:29:03.945
Is there...?

01:29:04.203 --> 01:29:06.274
Sorry, Mr. Wright, just one second.

01:29:07.039 --> 01:29:08.712
Good luck! We love you!

01:29:08.841 --> 01:29:10.548
I love you! Thanks, guys!

01:29:11.043 --> 01:29:13.045
Text me Quinton's number!

01:29:13.279 --> 01:29:15.054
- Really?
- Really.

01:29:15.381 --> 01:29:17.987
Finally, I got it.
Here's your ticket.

01:29:18.050 --> 01:29:21.554
Enjoy your trip to Paris.
Your gate is that way.

01:29:21.787 --> 01:29:24.563
Have a safe flight, Mr. Wright!

01:29:51.317 --> 01:29:52.421
What are you doing?

01:30:17.777 --> 01:30:21.953
- Please, please, please!
- It's too late. I'm sorry.

01:30:40.466 --> 01:30:41.638
William.

01:30:41.767 --> 01:30:42.802
Montana?

01:30:43.302 --> 01:30:45.304
William, oh, my God.

01:30:46.138 --> 01:30:50.644
I just saw your plane leave
and I thought you were gone.

01:30:51.143 --> 01:30:54.283
The agent entered
the wrong gate on my boarding pass.

01:30:54.347 --> 01:30:56.623
But I thought you...

01:30:56.982 --> 01:30:58.655
I thought you got your proposal.

01:30:59.852 --> 01:31:01.126
I said no.

01:31:02.488 --> 01:31:03.489
No husband?

01:31:05.725 --> 01:31:06.726
No Taylor?

01:31:07.493 --> 01:31:09.166
Not anymore.

01:31:10.996 --> 01:31:14.409
The only baggage I've got is on
the way to France right now.

01:31:15.835 --> 01:31:17.337
It's just me.

01:31:18.671 --> 01:31:22.517
What are you trying to say
with the Cracker Jack box?

01:31:22.742 --> 01:31:24.016
I don't understand.

01:31:24.143 --> 01:31:25.417
Mo, listen.

01:31:29.181 --> 01:31:32.185
I was standing alone
in my apartment.

01:31:33.185 --> 01:31:34.858
And I realized...

01:31:37.189 --> 01:31:39.362
why wasn't it finished?

01:31:40.526 --> 01:31:42.597
It wasn't finished
because you weren't in it.

01:31:44.864 --> 01:31:49.711
And I realized that little Cracker Jack
box ring wasn't gonna fit no more.

01:31:50.035 --> 01:31:51.105
So...

01:31:53.205 --> 01:31:55.446
I found one that would.

01:32:06.218 --> 01:32:08.391
Montana Christina Moore...

01:32:13.893 --> 01:32:15.736
for the second time...

01:32:16.128 --> 01:32:18.301
and this time for all
the right reasons...

01:32:22.234 --> 01:32:23.577
would you marry me?

01:32:23.903 --> 01:32:26.247
Yes, yes, yes.

01:32:27.239 --> 01:32:28.411
William.

01:32:31.911 --> 01:32:34.983
After thirty days
and 30,000 miles

01:32:35.047 --> 01:32:37.254
of searching the skies
for Mr. Right...

01:32:37.316 --> 01:32:41.321
it turns out he was living
across the hall the whole time.

01:32:41.587 --> 01:32:44.761
And with any luck,
he'll work the same job...

01:32:45.090 --> 01:32:48.594
drive the same truck
and love the same woman...

01:32:48.928 --> 01:32:51.272
for the rest of his life.

01:32:56.936 --> 01:32:58.438
- We did it!
- Yes!

01:32:59.438 --> 01:33:00.781
We did it.

01:33:01.273 --> 01:33:03.344
I am so glad that's over.

01:33:03.609 --> 01:33:06.783
Now I can finally get
back to my life.

01:33:09.448 --> 01:33:13.453
Which starts this weekend.

01:33:13.953 --> 01:33:17.127
I have a date with an
amazingly gorgeous man.

01:33:18.290 --> 01:33:19.291
Oh!

01:33:19.692 --> 01:33:21.365
Looks like I got a hot date, too.

01:33:21.627 --> 01:33:23.470
Oh, Sam.

01:33:23.796 --> 01:33:25.798
He works at the Renaissance.

01:33:27.533 --> 01:33:29.206
Well, mine's the manager.

01:33:31.704 --> 01:33:32.774
No.

01:33:38.377 --> 01:33:40.721
You bitch! Why?

01:33:41.146 --> 01:33:43.490
That's my man!
I had him first!

01:33:43.816 --> 01:33:45.420
He's mine! I'm going to...

01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:52.291
I fell in love again
and it happened in a minute

01:33:53.626 --> 01:33:58.302
My eyes shot out like a fish out of
water and I'm jumpin' in it

01:33:58.697 --> 01:34:01.644
Oh, I don't hold back
No, I don't hold back

01:34:01.734 --> 01:34:04.408
I never stay within the lines

01:34:04.737 --> 01:34:07.650
I don't hold back
No, I don't hold back

01:34:07.706 --> 01:34:10.312
I'm gonna take what's mine

01:34:11.644 --> 01:34:14.250
Oh, don't get scared for me

01:34:14.613 --> 01:34:16.718
Just be prepared for me

01:34:16.849 --> 01:34:22.891
'Cause I'm in love with love

01:34:22.955 --> 01:34:29.065
'Cause I'm in love with love

01:34:29.128 --> 01:34:30.732
In love

01:34:31.305 --> 01:34:37.394
