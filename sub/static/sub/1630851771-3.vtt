00:00.083 --> 00:01.709
Previously, on "Below Deck"...

00:01.709 --> 00:02.959
How you doing, pal?

00:02.959 --> 00:04.250
-Good, Cap.
-Good to be here.

00:04.250 --> 00:05.626
My Captain Lee is
----ing back.

00:05.626 --> 00:10.667
Mwah.

00:10.667 --> 00:12.250
This ----ing sucks.

00:12.250 --> 00:14.125
I just need to train them
to do a little better.

00:14.125 --> 00:15.876
We have to step up our game.

00:15.876 --> 00:18.167
Loving service, but doing
both is gonna be difficult,

00:18.167 --> 00:20.417
because I can't pick up
the slack if there is any.

00:20.417 --> 00:22.918
Get your sh--
together, Heather.

00:22.918 --> 00:26.626
Nobody wants me to
get sour, trust me.

00:26.626 --> 00:29.626
You need anything?

00:29.626 --> 00:31.792
Okay.

00:31.792 --> 00:33.626
I have.

00:33.626 --> 00:35.959
I'm really shocked about
Eddie's behavior behind my back.

00:35.959 --> 00:37.542
It was actually very hurtful.

00:37.542 --> 00:40.250
You are going to be a
working first officer.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.918
You are directly under me.

00:41.918 --> 00:44.417
With great power comes
great responsibility indeed.

00:44.417 --> 00:53.000
Cheers, guys, to
a happy season ahead.

00:53.000 --> 00:54.417
Oh!

00:54.417 --> 00:56.000
But did you guys see
Rayna kinda, like...

00:56.000 --> 00:57.167
I think they're gonna
hook up, straight up.

00:57.167 --> 00:58.501
Yeah, I think so.

00:58.501 --> 01:23.542
I have never seen
a crew romance work out.

01:23.542 --> 01:25.083
[alarm blares]

01:25.083 --> 01:32.626
New day, hella sh-- to do.

01:32.626 --> 01:35.459
No butties, no.

01:35.459 --> 01:37.834
Oh, God, I hope I got this
before the captain saw it.

01:37.834 --> 01:40.459
I need Advil.

01:40.459 --> 01:42.792
No, I can't wear that,
that's disgusting.

01:42.792 --> 01:47.876
Hey, good morning.

01:47.876 --> 01:49.167
Morning.

01:49.167 --> 01:51.834
How's it going?

01:51.834 --> 01:54.959
-How's it going?
-Good, how are you?

01:54.959 --> 01:59.250
Good, good.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.584
I kissed Jake.

02:00.584 --> 02:03.834
I mean, whatever, who cares?

02:03.834 --> 02:05.459
Morning, everyone feeling
all right today?

02:05.459 --> 02:09.459
Yeah.

02:09.459 --> 02:10.876
Yeah? Good.

02:10.876 --> 02:12.542
It was so hot.

02:12.542 --> 02:15.709
Like, the pulse of my coochie's,
like [beating noises].

02:15.709 --> 02:22.083
So, it wants to.

02:22.083 --> 02:23.584
Morning, see you guys
on deck in five minutes.

02:23.584 --> 02:25.000
See you, see you.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.751
Did you have fun
last night, darling?

02:26.751 --> 02:27.751
I did, I had a blast.

02:27.751 --> 02:29.501
I drank too much, but...

02:29.501 --> 02:31.334
We might wanna see how
Rayna's feeling today.

02:31.334 --> 02:34.417
Yeah, Rayna and Jake,
it's a thing.

02:34.417 --> 02:36.834
So today, you can kind
of run the wash-down.

02:36.834 --> 02:38.417
Cool.

02:38.417 --> 02:39.667
You know, let people
know where they need to be,

02:39.667 --> 02:40.792
see how that goes for you.

02:40.792 --> 02:41.959
Yeah.

02:41.959 --> 02:43.834
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

02:43.834 --> 02:46.501
So, I'm gonna start
you on crew mess.

02:46.501 --> 02:47.834
Okay.

02:47.834 --> 02:49.584
And then Fraser,
I'm gonna have you

02:49.584 --> 02:51.250
just get straight
on to master.

02:51.250 --> 02:54.584
After this last charter,
I'm irritated with my team.

02:54.584 --> 02:57.375
So, really need
to be more hands-on,

02:57.375 --> 02:59.334
because
we have to do better.

02:59.334 --> 03:02.751
Better.

03:02.751 --> 03:05.501
Let's do better.

03:05.501 --> 03:07.042
Cool.

03:07.042 --> 03:08.501
Did you guys just
listen to our sh--

03:08.501 --> 03:09.626
when it comes to
entertainment stuff?

03:09.626 --> 03:11.000
I ----ing hate
American music.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.292
Yeah, [bleep] American music.

03:12.292 --> 03:14.083
I know.

03:14.083 --> 03:16.709
Go to a concert to see some guy
standing behind a desk, going...

03:16.709 --> 03:18.501

03:27.876 --> 03:31.792
Oh, my Lord.

03:31.792 --> 03:39.292
Stop, and then... yeah.

03:39.292 --> 03:44.000
Heather, Eddie, and Rachel, can
I see you guys in the crew mess?

03:44.000 --> 03:45.209
Copy for Rachel.

03:45.209 --> 03:46.834
-Copy.
-Copy.

03:46.834 --> 03:50.834
[yawns]

03:50.834 --> 03:52.584
There he is.
Hey, sports fans.

03:52.584 --> 03:53.751
What's up?

03:53.751 --> 03:56.167
Thank you very much, sir.

03:56.167 --> 03:58.375
Okay, primary charter
guest is Michael Durham.

03:58.375 --> 04:01.334
Michael is a Seattle-based
real estate broker

04:01.334 --> 04:03.542
with an appreciation
for fine whiskey.

04:03.542 --> 04:06.542
Joining Michael are his
other broker friends,

04:06.542 --> 04:09.667
Justin and Terri, who work
together at the same firm;

04:09.667 --> 04:12.584
Colin, Sean, and
his fiancé, Curtis.

04:12.584 --> 04:15.584
That is your classic
real estate broker pose.

04:15.584 --> 04:17.918
Can't you just picture that
on a billboard somewhere?

04:17.918 --> 04:20.709
I can actually see me sitting
on his face at a bus stop.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.125
[laughing]

04:22.125 --> 04:24.334
Okay.

04:24.334 --> 04:25.709
Which you know what
I'm talking about, right?

04:25.709 --> 04:27.876
On the bench.

04:27.876 --> 04:29.501
Okay, so big bourbon drinkers.

04:29.501 --> 04:31.083
-Coffee...
-Coffee with bourbon.

04:31.083 --> 04:32.876
They would like to invite
me to a whiskey-paired,

04:32.876 --> 04:35.083
multi-course dinner.

04:35.083 --> 04:37.709
The guests are requesting
a white party on night one,

04:37.709 --> 04:42.459
and they wanna do a
Hawaiian luau on day number two.

04:42.459 --> 04:43.834
Love!

04:43.834 --> 04:45.959
The good news is we have
a late pickup, so...

04:45.959 --> 04:47.375
Ooh.

04:47.375 --> 04:48.375
We don't need to worry
about lunch

04:48.375 --> 04:50.042
Okay, cool.

04:50.042 --> 04:52.375
They also want golf balls off
the back of the boat.

04:52.375 --> 04:53.542
Cool, sounds good.

04:53.542 --> 04:54.792
-Thank you.
-Later, kids.

04:54.792 --> 04:56.501
-Later.
-Bye, Captain, thank you.

04:56.501 --> 04:59.042
♪ Do, do, do, do

04:59.042 --> 05:05.834
Oi...

05:05.834 --> 05:07.167
I was trying to slow up,
and then those

05:07.167 --> 05:08.334
----ing blue shots
came in.

05:08.334 --> 05:09.417
Yeah, I had two of them.

05:09.417 --> 05:11.417
-I had two of them, too.
-Ugh!

05:11.417 --> 05:13.667
How's your team doing
the day after the night out?

05:13.667 --> 05:15.000
Get a little lit up last night?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.042
-I loved it.
-They're cool, man.

05:17.042 --> 05:18.083
-Yeah.
-They're good.

05:18.083 --> 05:19.501
They're all working hard.

05:19.501 --> 05:21.292
With Eddie, I am playing
nice at this point.

05:21.292 --> 05:22.709
Saying the things that
he did about me,

05:22.709 --> 05:24.125
it felt like betrayal,

05:24.125 --> 05:26.501
because to my face,
he was my friend.

05:26.501 --> 05:28.751
Someone's gotta have a talk
with her when she's sober again.

05:28.751 --> 05:30.501
Be like, you're a ----ing
monster when you drink.

05:30.501 --> 05:32.042
Rachel is obnoxious.

05:32.042 --> 05:33.417
Just keep her the [bleep]
away from me right now.

05:33.417 --> 05:35.834
I hold maybe just a
tad bit of bitterness,

05:35.834 --> 05:37.501
but I really need
to get rid of that,

05:37.501 --> 05:39.083
because that's not my flavor.

05:39.083 --> 05:40.667
Can't wait till they're
not my team anymore.

05:40.667 --> 05:43.334
Aw!

05:43.334 --> 05:46.125
I can just sulk away
into the shadows

05:46.125 --> 05:49.250
-of the first officer's cabin.
-Right.

05:49.250 --> 05:51.125
Hey, cutie.

05:51.125 --> 05:53.959
I'm so tired.

05:53.959 --> 05:55.792
-It's terrible.
-How are you?

05:55.792 --> 05:57.250
Good, how are you?

05:57.250 --> 05:59.626
Well, okay, so I was
a bit tipsy last night.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.542
I love you.

06:01.542 --> 06:04.334
To put it lightly.

06:04.334 --> 06:05.918
-What?
-Did I do anything silly?

06:05.918 --> 06:08.125
-No, you didn't.
-Did we all go to bed together?

06:08.125 --> 06:10.709
-You went to bed, and then...
-Oh!

06:10.709 --> 06:12.501
We went to bed, like,
maybe 10 minutes after you.

06:12.501 --> 06:14.417
Did you have a smooch?

06:14.417 --> 06:15.626
-Did I?
-Yeah, a little kissy?

06:15.626 --> 06:16.626
Ugh.

06:16.626 --> 06:18.959
Did you?
Did you?

06:18.959 --> 06:21.375
Well, it's good.
He's amazing.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.876
I know, but I don't
want to, like...

06:23.876 --> 06:26.709
I really like someone,
and he lives in Canada.

06:26.709 --> 06:28.292
Issa's someone that I hooked up
with a couple months ago

06:28.292 --> 06:29.834
in Mexico in the club.

06:29.834 --> 06:31.709
And then no one can
really stop drunk Rayna,

06:31.709 --> 06:34.042
so next thing I know,
I left with Issa.

06:34.042 --> 06:36.250
We've just been talking,
nothing, you know, too serious.

06:36.250 --> 06:38.334
He's the one I'm
still trying to figure out.

06:38.334 --> 06:41.709
But you know,
he loves him some Rayna.

06:41.709 --> 06:43.125
And so you don't
wanna mess with...

06:43.125 --> 06:44.626
I don't care if I kissed Jake,

06:44.626 --> 06:45.667
because I'm still
single or whatever.

06:45.667 --> 06:46.834
Of course, right.

06:46.834 --> 06:48.125
But I don't wanna [bleep] him.

06:48.125 --> 06:49.667
-You don't have to.
-I know, I know.

06:49.667 --> 06:50.709
So you just... you wanted,
like, a friendly flirt.

06:50.709 --> 06:52.667
Yeah, yeah.

06:52.667 --> 06:54.709
I would friendly flirt with
Jake until the cows come home.

06:54.709 --> 06:57.167
He's so cute.
Like, I'm so into that.

06:57.167 --> 06:59.000
I ----ing love you.

06:59.000 --> 07:10.792

07:14.417 --> 07:16.000
Hi, Nick speaking.

07:16.000 --> 07:18.209
Hi, Nick, it's
Rachel from My Seanna.

07:18.209 --> 07:20.792
-Hey.
-I
'm calling about a pig

07:20.792 --> 07:22.959
for a beach luau,

07:22.959 --> 07:29.167
and then also do you
have a spit available?

07:29.167 --> 07:37.042
-Thank you, Nick. Bye-bye.
-Bye.

07:37.042 --> 07:41.542
I want a Modelo Pacifico.

07:41.542 --> 07:43.709
Woo, dinner.

07:43.709 --> 07:45.709
-Heather?
-Yes, darling?

07:45.709 --> 07:47.918
-I've finished the cabins.
-Nice.

07:47.918 --> 07:48.918
And then am I
okay to clock off?

07:48.918 --> 07:50.667
-Please.
-Perfect.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.417
Hey, Jake, what else
needs to get done?

07:52.417 --> 07:54.626
Well, we're just doing
the polishing for now.

07:54.626 --> 07:56.000
Okay.

07:56.000 --> 07:57.334
Yeah, everything's
pretty good to be honest.

07:57.334 --> 07:58.334
Good, that's awesome, thank you.

07:58.334 --> 07:59.626
Go take a shower.

07:59.626 --> 08:01.042
Yeah, we can smell
you from here.

08:01.042 --> 08:02.542
Eddie, Eddie, Rachel.

08:02.542 --> 08:06.459
Can I talk to you
in the main salon?

08:06.459 --> 08:07.876
Hey, babe!

08:07.876 --> 08:12.542
Oh sh--.

08:12.542 --> 08:15.292
So, what's up?

08:15.292 --> 08:17.209
Um...

08:17.209 --> 08:20.459
I kinda wanna have
a little chat.

08:20.459 --> 08:25.125
Last season, there were
some really alarming things

08:25.125 --> 08:29.167
that were said on
your behalf about me.

08:29.167 --> 08:30.584
It was, like,
viciously attacking.

08:30.584 --> 08:32.334
Hm.

08:32.334 --> 08:34.334
Going straight for, like,
my integrity and character,

08:34.334 --> 08:40.834
and it was really uncalled for.

08:40.834 --> 08:42.292
Coming up...

08:42.292 --> 08:44.792
All I expect out of you
is to do your jobs.

08:44.792 --> 08:46.876
I do have two rules:

08:46.876 --> 08:49.709
Do not embarrass yourself,
do not embarrass the boat.

08:49.709 --> 08:49.709
I will bury your ass.

08:49.709 --> 08:59.000
Previously, on "Below Deck"...

08:59.000 --> 09:01.792
There were some really
alarming things

09:01.792 --> 09:04.626
that were said on
your behalf about me.

09:04.626 --> 09:06.751
It was, like,
viciously attacking

09:06.751 --> 09:08.167
that kind of threw me
for a loop,

09:08.167 --> 09:09.959
and it was really,
really hurtful,

09:09.959 --> 09:11.459
and it stayed with me

09:11.459 --> 09:15.792
for the whole duration
before this season.

09:15.792 --> 09:17.584
I'm really sorry for
saying anything

09:17.584 --> 09:19.167
that might have
hurt your feelings.

09:19.167 --> 09:22.042
I did not get along with
the Rachel of last season,

09:22.042 --> 09:24.417
and I never came and
talked to you directly

09:24.417 --> 09:27.083
about my issues with you,
and I'm sorry that I didn't.

09:27.083 --> 09:28.501
Yeah.

09:28.501 --> 09:30.209
Last time Rachel and
I worked together,

09:30.209 --> 09:32.167
we started out with, like,
a really good relationship,

09:32.167 --> 09:33.501
but then she started drinking.

09:33.501 --> 09:34.918
She's just a different person.

09:34.918 --> 09:36.834
I want some ----ing
dirty-ass sh--.

09:36.834 --> 09:38.000
Walking away from
this situation.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.000
I ----ing hate this.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.375
It makes my skin crawl.

09:41.375 --> 09:43.000
Titties!

09:43.000 --> 09:45.292
But I should have talked
to Rachel personally.

09:45.292 --> 09:47.918
So, the only thing I can do
is just be better from here.

09:47.918 --> 09:50.042
Just to make sure that,
like, it doesn't happen again,

09:50.042 --> 09:52.334
that's all,
because it's super hurtful.

09:52.334 --> 09:54.083
I get that,
that must have been hard.

09:54.083 --> 09:55.667
Thank you for giving
me another chance

09:55.667 --> 09:57.042
to be your friend this season.

09:57.042 --> 09:58.542
-Okay, thank you.
-Seriously.

09:58.542 --> 10:00.709
Moving forward through
this sh--uation,

10:00.709 --> 10:03.542
I think Eddie and I can play
in the same sandbox this season

10:03.542 --> 10:05.501
without stabbing
each other with spades.

10:05.501 --> 10:07.459
Yay.

10:07.459 --> 10:10.250
I won't have to flip
a table or eat someone's larynx.

10:10.250 --> 10:12.375
All right, well,
let's go [bleep] this charter

10:12.375 --> 10:13.959
in the face.

10:13.959 --> 10:18.042
-I'm gonna hug it out.
-Hug it out!

10:18.042 --> 10:19.584
-You're awesome.
-All right.

10:19.584 --> 10:20.626
Get some sleep,
I'll see you in the morning.

10:20.626 --> 10:21.626
See you in the morning, buddy.

10:21.626 --> 10:23.375
This looks great.

10:23.375 --> 10:25.209
And I'm gonna be up earlier,
so it'll be fine.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.375
[phone rings]

10:26.375 --> 10:27.417
Hi, good evening.

10:27.417 --> 10:29.375
This is Ed Lucas on My Seanna.

10:29.375 --> 10:30.792
Listen, I got some
provisions that we need

10:30.792 --> 10:32.667
for this charter coming up.

10:32.667 --> 10:35.000
Golf clubs and
biodegradable golf balls.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.417
We'd also need Astroturf
for the tee.

10:38.417 --> 10:44.042
I really appreciate that,
thank you.

10:44.042 --> 10:45.459
Hello.

10:45.459 --> 10:47.876
I had to make my one
phone call from prison.

10:47.876 --> 10:49.042
You look tired.

10:49.042 --> 10:52.167
Yeah, I'm ----ing exhausted.

10:52.167 --> 10:54.626
Shut up!

10:54.626 --> 10:57.042
Stop making fun of my pajamas.

10:57.042 --> 11:00.834
Why are you in the garage?

11:00.834 --> 11:03.459
Oh, my God.

11:03.459 --> 11:05.083
My mom and I are close.

11:05.083 --> 11:09.292
She had me at a very young age,
19, so we bicker a lot.

11:09.292 --> 11:11.667
Stop talking, stop talking,
stop talking.

11:11.667 --> 11:14.292
When I decided I was going to
school to be a cosmetologist,

11:14.292 --> 11:16.375
she went back to school
to be a mortician.

11:16.375 --> 11:18.709
She wants me to do hair
and makeup on her bodies.

11:18.709 --> 11:19.876
I said no.

11:19.876 --> 11:21.792
[laughing]

11:21.792 --> 11:23.542
I don't know why
I ever call you.

11:23.542 --> 11:24.542
Because you love me.

11:24.542 --> 11:37.667
Love you, goodbye.

11:37.667 --> 11:38.834
Oof!

11:38.834 --> 11:42.834
I'm so tired.

11:42.834 --> 11:44.959
Note to self...
don't start projects.

11:44.959 --> 11:46.459
-How you doing, Wes?
-Hey, Captain.

11:46.459 --> 11:48.584
That slip over there is gonna
be our new home.

11:48.584 --> 11:50.292
Ooh!

11:50.292 --> 11:51.292
Oh, man, that'll make things
a heck of a lot easier.

11:51.292 --> 11:53.083
Yes, it will.

11:53.083 --> 11:54.667
Look at all the room
we got to maneuver over there.

11:54.667 --> 11:56.000
I know, right?

11:56.000 --> 11:57.626
We've got about
18 feet here, so.

11:57.626 --> 11:59.000
Nice.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.000
Because we only draw
eight and a half.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.042
What?

12:01.042 --> 12:02.876
My boat's 7.5.

12:02.876 --> 12:04.125
I can't go really
that many places.

12:04.125 --> 12:05.709
Yeah.

12:05.709 --> 12:06.709
How are you doing?

12:06.709 --> 12:08.083
Good, how are you, love?

12:08.083 --> 12:09.167
Did you wanna get
started on ironing

12:09.167 --> 12:10.751
all of Captain Lee's clothes?

12:10.751 --> 12:12.292
Try to get them done
in the next hour and a half.

12:12.292 --> 12:15.918
Okay.

12:15.918 --> 12:23.751
-Are we uncovering?
-Why not?

12:23.751 --> 12:30.083
It is hot in here.

12:30.083 --> 12:32.334
All crew, we have
provisions on the dock.

12:32.334 --> 12:37.375
Copy.

12:37.375 --> 12:38.584
More!

12:38.584 --> 12:43.334
----ing hell.

12:43.334 --> 12:45.375
Ah!
That shocked my whole arm!

12:45.375 --> 12:48.417
-You all right?
-Yeah.

12:48.417 --> 12:50.626
As my grandma says,
"Good enough."

12:50.626 --> 12:52.083
Attention all crew,

12:52.083 --> 12:56.667
I'm gonna need everybody
in the sky lounge.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.000
Copy.

12:58.000 --> 13:00.626
Uh-oh.

13:00.626 --> 13:02.334
It is assigned seating.

13:02.334 --> 13:04.083
It's like you pick your seat
the first day in school,

13:04.083 --> 13:06.000
-and if somebody else...
-Takes it?

13:06.000 --> 13:09.083
Oh, enemy for life.

13:09.083 --> 13:10.459
How's everybody doing?

13:10.459 --> 13:12.417
-Good, Cap.
-Good.

13:12.417 --> 13:16.083
We didn't get to have our formal
meeting that we normally have,

13:16.083 --> 13:18.167
so I thought
I would take this opportunity,

13:18.167 --> 13:19.584
because we have a late pickup.

13:19.584 --> 13:22.334
All I expect out of you
is to do your jobs.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.626
Radios is my pet peeve.

13:24.626 --> 13:26.667
If you are looking
for your radio,

13:26.667 --> 13:30.751
odds are I already have it.

13:30.751 --> 13:32.334
I will bury your ass.

13:32.334 --> 13:34.000
I do have two rules:

13:34.000 --> 13:38.542
Do not embarrass yourself,
do not embarrass the boat.

13:38.542 --> 13:40.542
I have no problem
with letting somebody go

13:40.542 --> 13:42.000
in the middle of a charter.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.751
I've got a pocketful
of plane tickets

13:43.751 --> 13:46.375
that I hope I don't have to use,

13:46.375 --> 13:49.375
but if I do,
it'll be quick and severe.

13:49.375 --> 13:51.667
Captain Lee reminds me
of my dad.

13:51.667 --> 13:54.334
It's like a chocolate chip
cookie that's been sitting out.

13:54.334 --> 13:58.125
Like, hard on the exterior,
but very soft and mushy inside.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.792
I mean, well,
that's how my dad is,

13:59.792 --> 14:01.501
but I'm hoping that's
how Captain Lee is, too.

14:01.501 --> 14:04.000
Work hard or get fired...
that's it.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
-Have a good season.
-Thank you, Captain.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.334
Let's kick this charter's booty.

14:09.334 --> 14:11.042
Those dresses don't
need to be steamed.

14:11.042 --> 14:13.083
-We have so much to do up there.
-I know, I know.

14:13.083 --> 14:14.834
-This is dinner stuff.
-I get it.

14:14.834 --> 14:16.042
-You done scuppers?
-Yeah, man.

14:16.042 --> 14:18.209
-Sick.
-And everything nice and shiny.

14:18.209 --> 14:21.042
This could be the year, Eddie.
I like what I'm seeing so far.

14:21.042 --> 14:22.042
-Jake?
-Yeah.

14:22.042 --> 14:23.334
He hustles.

14:23.334 --> 14:24.417
What's his background?

14:24.417 --> 14:26.542
Worked on two 50-meter yachts,

14:26.542 --> 14:28.459
and he got up to lead
deckhand in one of them.

14:28.459 --> 14:30.125
That speaks well for him.

14:30.125 --> 14:32.542
I know that Eddie
would like to promote Jake,

14:32.542 --> 14:35.083
but I have seen that backfire,

14:35.083 --> 14:37.459
where you give
somebody too much responsibility

14:37.459 --> 14:39.584
and they crash and burn.

14:39.584 --> 14:42.918
Watch the bow, please.
Goddamn it!

14:42.918 --> 14:44.584
I need the spring line done!

14:44.584 --> 14:46.125
Watch your bow,
watch your bow, watch your bow!

14:46.125 --> 14:47.792
Goddamn it!

14:47.792 --> 14:50.959
And it's your fault, because
you set them up to fail.

14:50.959 --> 14:52.626
I don't want that to happen.

14:52.626 --> 14:54.209
Since I'm first officer,

14:54.209 --> 14:56.167
I would like to get off deck
as soon as possible.

14:56.167 --> 14:57.959
After I do a
little more observing,

14:57.959 --> 15:00.125
we'll maybe make a call
on a lead deckhand.

15:00.125 --> 15:01.375
Cool.

15:01.375 --> 15:02.626
Fraser, can you meet me
in the master?

15:02.626 --> 15:04.417
Copy that.

15:04.417 --> 15:07.626
I'll just walk you through what
I want for final touches.

15:07.626 --> 15:08.918
-Yeah.
-You need a towel in here.

15:08.918 --> 15:10.334
Yeah.

15:10.334 --> 15:12.584
One more hand towel
on this side as well.

15:12.584 --> 15:16.417
I feel absolutely terrified
going into this second charter.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.209
These orchids, like,
need more love.

15:18.209 --> 15:19.834
Okay, okay, okay.

15:19.834 --> 15:22.042
I'm a little scarred
from the trip we just had.

15:22.042 --> 15:23.709
It just never stopped.

15:23.709 --> 15:30.876
Hi, how's it going?

15:30.876 --> 15:32.083
Oh, my gosh.

15:32.083 --> 15:33.709
We don't have our game together.

15:33.709 --> 15:35.417
Wipe this one, and this.

15:35.417 --> 15:37.042
That... yeah.

15:37.042 --> 15:39.167
Shall we have a quick liaison
in the sky lounge?

15:39.167 --> 15:41.417
Yeah, let's do it.

15:41.417 --> 15:43.751
Jess, do you wanna come
up to the sky lounge?

15:43.751 --> 15:46.459
I've climbed the ladder
for the last five years,

15:46.459 --> 15:48.959
and I've done every sh--
job you could ever think of,

15:48.959 --> 15:51.792
and I busted my ass, and
that's exactly what I expect

15:51.792 --> 15:53.667
from my team.

15:53.667 --> 15:57.125
There is no room for errors.

15:57.125 --> 15:59.584
I want you both to
know where I come from

15:59.584 --> 16:01.918
in a bigger picture sense.

16:01.918 --> 16:05.000
I'm gonna need to pull you
to make the guests happy.

16:05.000 --> 16:06.918
I need you both to
be a little fluid.

16:06.918 --> 16:09.834
With that being said,
I feel that we need to pick up

16:09.834 --> 16:12.501
the pace in laundry and
making some cocktails.

16:12.501 --> 16:14.125
Fifteen-minute martinis,

16:14.125 --> 16:16.667
we should really try to
come up with a quicker way

16:16.667 --> 16:19.000
and a quicker recipe.

16:19.000 --> 16:20.542
It's not that I'm saying
we need to drop

16:20.542 --> 16:22.417
the standard down in any way.

16:22.417 --> 16:26.876
It's just I want us to be able
to keep the ball rolling.

16:26.876 --> 16:28.876
All I got from this meeting
is that we're going to be

16:28.876 --> 16:30.709
running it the same way
we just ran it for the last,

16:30.709 --> 16:32.834
which was a load of sh--.

16:32.834 --> 16:35.751
We'll keep you on mornings,
we'll keep you on lates.

16:35.751 --> 16:39.667
I have never worked with
a chief stew...

16:39.667 --> 16:43.292
And so, I'm feeling insecure
with her as my leader.

16:43.292 --> 16:45.542
I feel that if you don't
keep progressing every day,

16:45.542 --> 16:47.083
you might as well die.

16:47.083 --> 16:48.751
I mean, let's kick some ass.

16:48.751 --> 16:52.417
Heather reminds me of
my grandmother...

16:52.417 --> 16:54.667
She always has to have
a hand in something.

16:54.667 --> 16:56.501
We just have to do
everything the way

16:56.501 --> 16:57.876
that Heather wants it done.

16:57.876 --> 16:59.125
[snorts]

16:59.125 --> 17:01.000
Let's get it!

17:01.000 --> 17:02.584
Attention all crew, I need
everybody in their whites.

17:02.584 --> 17:07.959
-Copy that.
-Copy, Captain.

17:07.959 --> 17:09.375
-Try to get those streaks off...
-Yeah.

17:09.375 --> 17:10.792
And see if it's, like...

17:10.792 --> 17:12.167
-I'll get that glass stuff...
-Yeah.

17:12.167 --> 17:13.501
We have 15 minutes
till guest arrival.

17:13.501 --> 17:14.501
Always down to
the wire, isn't it?

17:14.501 --> 17:16.083
Let's go get 'em.

17:16.083 --> 17:17.417
[champagne pops]

17:17.417 --> 17:18.417
Jesus.

17:18.417 --> 17:20.042
[laughing]

17:20.042 --> 17:22.417
This is so awesome,
I love it!

17:22.417 --> 17:23.876
Oh, here they come.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.542
All crew, they are
walking down the dock.

17:25.542 --> 17:26.876
Oh sh--.

17:26.876 --> 17:28.000
God, this is gonna
be ----ing great.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.834
-Dude, look at that boat.
-Oh, my God.

17:32.834 --> 17:34.459
I dunno about you,
I'm ready for a cock... oh!

17:34.459 --> 17:39.626
I'm throwing somebody
in the ----ing water.

17:39.626 --> 17:41.459
So it's gonna be...

17:41.459 --> 17:45.000
This crew has no idea
what's in store for them.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.000
Coming up...

17:46.000 --> 17:47.417
Justin?

17:47.417 --> 17:49.834
What the [bleep]
is going on, right?

17:49.834 --> 17:51.751
They're drunker'n
a four-peckered goat.

17:51.751 --> 17:53.125
What's going on, man?

17:53.125 --> 17:54.876
This sh-- upstairs
can kiss my ass.

17:54.876 --> 17:57.167
They're drunker than a
herd of four-peckered goats.

17:57.167 --> 17:58.501
You're being a ----ing jackass.

17:58.501 --> 17:58.501
-Thank you.
-Go [bleep] yourself.

17:58.501 --> 18:05.667
There were some really
alarming things

18:05.667 --> 18:08.584
I dunno about you,
I'm ready for a cock... oh!

18:08.584 --> 18:11.959
I'm throwing somebody
in the ----ing water.

18:11.959 --> 18:14.167
This crew has no idea
what's in store for them.

18:14.167 --> 18:15.751
-Hello, everybody!
-How we doing?

18:15.751 --> 18:16.792
-Hello!
-Captain Lee.

18:16.792 --> 18:18.125
Yes, sir, good to see you.

18:18.125 --> 18:19.501
Hi, Heather, pleasure
to meet you.

18:19.501 --> 18:20.751
-Hello, Heather.
-Can I offer you a cold towel?

18:20.751 --> 18:21.959
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi, Heather.

18:21.959 --> 18:26.542
You can take a towel.

18:26.542 --> 18:27.542
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

18:27.542 --> 18:28.918
-Cheers.
-Yeah.

18:28.918 --> 18:30.626
Welcome to St. Kitts.

18:30.626 --> 18:32.083
I'm gonna have Heather
give you a tour of the boat,

18:32.083 --> 18:33.876
and we're gonna get
the hell outta Dodge

18:33.876 --> 18:35.000
and go have some fun.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.042
Let's get the hell out of here!

18:36.042 --> 18:37.501
That sounds like a good plan.

18:37.501 --> 18:38.501
-Thank you.
-Let's take a tour of the boat.

18:38.501 --> 18:39.626
Go to work.

18:39.626 --> 18:40.667
We can get into our blue polos.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.000
Let's come on up this way.

18:42.000 --> 18:44.626
This is what we call
our bridge deck aft.

18:44.626 --> 18:46.709
You'll find me passed out
there about every damn day.

18:46.709 --> 18:52.250
Well, just tell me if we
should wake you or not.

18:52.250 --> 18:54.667
Nah.

18:54.667 --> 18:55.918
-Yeah.
-Maybe.

18:55.918 --> 18:58.000
And this is what
we call the sundeck.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.250
My hot tub at home
is set up the same way,

18:59.250 --> 19:00.250
just bar and everything.

19:00.250 --> 19:02.000
Minus the yacht.

19:02.000 --> 19:03.292
Minus the hot tub and the bar.

19:03.292 --> 19:07.083
Here you go, guys.

19:07.083 --> 19:09.876
I'm gonna kick you down
the Goddamn stairs.

19:09.876 --> 19:10.876
-Is that all of it?
-Yep.

19:10.876 --> 19:12.042
Come down this way.

19:12.042 --> 19:14.125
I will do whatever
the [bleep] I want.

19:14.125 --> 19:15.083
The master stateroom.

19:15.083 --> 19:16.918
-Wow!
-This is nice.

19:16.918 --> 19:18.125
Are you gonna sit like
Richard Nixon at that desk?

19:18.125 --> 19:19.959
Trump, Donald Trump.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.584
You have two bathrooms?

19:21.584 --> 19:23.083
One for when I sh--
and one for when I don't.

19:23.083 --> 19:24.542
-Okay, those rails off.
-Copy.

19:24.542 --> 19:25.584
Nice.

19:25.584 --> 19:26.542
Will this work for the queen?

19:26.542 --> 19:27.542
That'll work.

19:27.542 --> 19:29.125
With your 38,000 shirts?

19:29.125 --> 19:31.042
-Let's make a train?
-Yeah, no.

19:31.042 --> 19:32.125
Makin' trains.

19:32.125 --> 19:33.125
So, how are you guys feeling?

19:33.125 --> 19:34.834
Are you feeling like
a little nibble?

19:34.834 --> 19:36.542
Bites would be lovely,
because we just finished

19:36.542 --> 19:40.042
an entire bottle of Tito's
while we were waiting.

19:40.042 --> 19:42.042
In my experience in yachting,

19:42.042 --> 19:45.000
having guests come on the
boat drunk is a great sign,

19:45.000 --> 19:46.918
because that just means
they're gonna get

19:46.918 --> 19:49.167
their hangover
in about three hours,

19:49.167 --> 19:51.918
so they're probably gonna
skip dinner, hopefully.

19:51.918 --> 19:54.042
Chahoo!

19:54.042 --> 19:56.459
We're just gonna set up some
nibbles on the bridge deck aft.

19:56.459 --> 19:59.042
I'd love it if you can find out
what time they want dinner.

19:59.042 --> 20:04.042
Yeah, of course.

20:04.042 --> 20:05.751
Passerelle secured,
we're all set.

20:05.751 --> 20:07.459
All right,
let's get outta here.

20:07.459 --> 20:08.417
You're starting with the
first line up there on the bow.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.792
-Copy.
-Here we go.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.000
Hey, let's go up front,
you wanna go?

20:11.000 --> 20:12.042
Let's watch them get outta here.

20:12.042 --> 20:13.501
Hold on, I need more
bourbon, though.

20:13.501 --> 20:14.584
All right, you got
that first line?

20:14.584 --> 20:16.000
-Yes.
-Yeah, pull, pull, pull.

20:16.000 --> 20:20.542
-Okay, I'll take that.
-Loosen it.

20:20.542 --> 20:21.626
And we're off.

20:21.626 --> 20:23.042
-This...
-This is ----ing cool.

20:23.042 --> 20:24.501
-...is amazing.
-Does not suck.

20:24.501 --> 20:27.542
All right,
let's tidy these lines up.

20:27.542 --> 20:29.792
No, we don't need to do fenders
until we get out of the channel.

20:29.792 --> 20:31.000
Yeah, let's take a picture
of all three of you.

20:31.000 --> 20:32.876
It's just shadows.

20:32.876 --> 20:36.459
-Jesus tap-dancing Christ.
-Port side is clear.

20:36.459 --> 20:37.667
Good job, everybody.

20:37.667 --> 20:39.167
Interior, interior, galley.

20:39.167 --> 20:41.083
Is there any way I can run
the platters up?

20:41.083 --> 20:42.584
Copy that, Rachel.

20:42.584 --> 20:44.792
And I've got some fresh
hummous coming up.

20:44.792 --> 20:49.125
Okay, so is this
going up to the bar?

20:49.125 --> 20:55.626
I'm a'comin'.

20:55.626 --> 20:56.876
How are you doing?

20:56.876 --> 20:57.876
Lovely, these peppers
are really good.

20:57.876 --> 20:58.918
Really good.

20:58.918 --> 21:00.626
Oh, just sit back and wait...

21:00.626 --> 21:02.209
Chef Rachel's about to take
you for a wild ride.

21:02.209 --> 21:05.125
Don't you even [bleep]
with me today.

21:05.125 --> 21:06.876
Would you like to chat
about a dinner time?

21:06.876 --> 21:08.542
Seven-thirtyish?

21:08.542 --> 21:10.000
Okay, tonight is the white
party and whiskey pairing.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.042
Chef Rachel wants to
plan around it,

21:12.042 --> 21:15.083
so we just wanted to touch base
with you which ones you liked,

21:15.083 --> 21:16.751
which you didn't.

21:16.751 --> 21:18.667
So, we've got the
Woodford Reserve,

21:18.667 --> 21:22.751
the Bullitt bourbon, Knob Creek,
Chivas Regal, and Maker's Mark.

21:22.751 --> 21:24.375
Okay, if we have
to choose three...

21:24.375 --> 21:26.167
The first three....
those are the actual bourbons.

21:26.167 --> 21:27.167
Oh, Woodford, Bullitt, and Knob?

21:27.167 --> 21:28.751
-Yes.
-Beautiful.

21:28.751 --> 21:29.959
-That'll be fine.
-It's gonna be great.

21:29.959 --> 21:30.959
Can I have this in
a thermal cup?

21:30.959 --> 21:32.751
In a little coffee cup?

21:32.751 --> 21:34.375
Well, I swear to God,
it'll make your life easier.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.584
Nothing says classy
like whiskey out of a thermos

21:36.584 --> 21:38.167
on a mega yacht.

21:38.167 --> 21:39.918
Lid or no lid, good sir?

21:39.918 --> 21:41.626
I'll take lid, thank you.

21:41.626 --> 21:43.417
Pleasure's all mine.

21:43.417 --> 21:45.042
-'Sup, sugarpuss?
-Wassup, wassup?

21:45.042 --> 21:47.083
How's your department work?

21:47.083 --> 21:48.083
How does my department work?

21:48.083 --> 21:49.292
Yeah.

21:49.292 --> 21:53.125
I am third,
so I do the grunt work.

21:53.125 --> 22:00.626
Fraser's usually on service,

22:00.626 --> 22:03.709
Good point.

22:03.709 --> 22:04.709
Ready on the anchor.

22:04.709 --> 22:11.918
On my mark, drop.

22:11.918 --> 22:13.042
Two and a half shots out.

22:13.042 --> 22:14.751
Copy that, check the stay.

22:14.751 --> 22:16.542
Short stay, 12:00.

22:16.542 --> 22:18.667
-Oh, yeah, you got it.
-Let's lock it in.

22:18.667 --> 22:22.501
All right,
securing her in.

22:22.501 --> 22:24.459
Ugh, ugh, ugh,
get it, get it, girl

22:24.459 --> 22:25.667
Drop it, drop it, drop it

22:25.667 --> 22:27.209
All the way down,
all the way down

22:27.209 --> 22:29.542
Ah, ah, ah, scrub that floor,
scrub that floor

22:29.542 --> 22:31.417
-Two hours till dinner.
-Yeah, no worries.

22:31.417 --> 22:32.709
-I'm gonna pull.
-I wanna do a Tom Yum.

22:32.709 --> 22:34.125
Yum.

22:34.125 --> 22:35.751
We'll do a pad Thai,
but it will be

22:35.751 --> 22:37.584
with lobster instead,
good to go.

22:37.584 --> 22:39.959
This one time
I was in Bangkok, right,

22:39.959 --> 22:42.751
I'm drinking shots of
Thai whiskey

22:42.751 --> 22:44.417
and all of a sudden
I come across this really

22:44.417 --> 22:47.334
dodgy guy on Khaosan Road
selling pad Thai with,

22:47.334 --> 22:50.459
like, the random street meat
that was incredibly greasy.

22:50.459 --> 22:51.626
Nothing says good times
like the next morning

22:51.626 --> 22:55.125
when you have fire snakes.

22:55.125 --> 22:57.542
Hello.

22:57.542 --> 22:58.542
How's it going?

22:58.542 --> 23:00.042
Good, how are you?

23:00.042 --> 23:02.209
I'm doing good, I just
wanted to check in,

23:02.209 --> 23:04.792
see if you're gonna join
them for dinner this evening.

23:04.792 --> 23:06.501
Okay. I can.

23:06.501 --> 23:09.167
I will not be participating
in the bourbon tasting, though.

23:09.167 --> 23:10.834
Of course.

23:10.834 --> 23:12.709
You want apple juice in
your bourbon shooters?

23:12.709 --> 23:15.959
Apple juice would be fine, give
it a little color with a lime.

23:15.959 --> 23:17.000
I would say we're gonna
be two people down soon.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.918
Really?

23:18.918 --> 23:20.501
If you wouldn't mind putting
more bourbon in that?

23:20.501 --> 23:22.000
Yeah, of course I can.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.626
They're enjoying their first
day, to say the least.

23:23.626 --> 23:25.042
They weren't lying
when they said

23:25.042 --> 23:29.167
they had mouths like
sailors, were they?

23:29.167 --> 23:30.709
Nice!

23:30.709 --> 23:32.542
That's not really enough
balls, I would say.

23:32.542 --> 23:34.709
I mean, they're not gonna be
hitting balls all ----ing night.

23:34.709 --> 23:36.709
Really, they're just gonna
wanna hit drivers anyway.

23:36.709 --> 23:38.501
[squealing]

23:38.501 --> 23:40.000
Oh, it's hard to contain,
it's alive.

23:40.000 --> 23:42.000
Where would you like it?

23:42.000 --> 23:43.125
-The corner over there.
-All right.

23:43.125 --> 23:44.751
Thank you.

23:44.751 --> 23:46.959
-Oh, I missed it!
-Are you guys golfing?

23:46.959 --> 23:47.959
Can we join you?

23:47.959 --> 23:49.000
[bleep] yeah, we can.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.584
-You gonna have a swing at this?
-Yeah.

23:50.584 --> 23:52.000
-Do you see that white boat?
-Yeah.

23:52.000 --> 23:54.959
I'm gonna hit it.

23:54.959 --> 23:56.083
You're not supposed to hit
the ----ing boat.

23:56.083 --> 23:57.125
Too late.

23:57.125 --> 23:58.542
Come on, get after it.

23:58.542 --> 24:00.751
Nice... nope.
Not that nice.

24:00.751 --> 24:02.209
Better than yours.

24:02.209 --> 24:04.167
-That was garbage.
-You didn't hit the deck.

24:04.167 --> 24:05.792
Watch this sh--.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.459
Oh [bleep].

24:07.459 --> 24:08.959
Jesus Christ, Durham,
you haven't played with that

24:08.959 --> 24:10.626
much carpet since you
were married last time.

24:10.626 --> 24:13.042
Ah!

24:13.042 --> 24:16.000
Hope you can sell houses better
than you can hit a golf ball.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.042
[bleep] off.

24:18.042 --> 24:27.459
All right, deck crew,
get into blacks.

24:27.459 --> 24:28.667
What's happening?

24:28.667 --> 24:29.876
Nothing.

24:29.876 --> 24:32.876
I'm really proud of my team.

24:32.876 --> 24:34.042
How did you think they did?

24:34.042 --> 24:35.501
You know, they'll be fine,

24:35.501 --> 24:37.459
and I like the fact that
Jake pays attention.

24:37.459 --> 24:39.751
Have you given any more
thought to Jake as lead?

24:39.751 --> 24:42.083
We could certainly
use a lead deckhand.

24:42.083 --> 24:46.167
I'm just concerned that
it might be too soon.

24:46.167 --> 24:47.959
Does he step up to the plate?

24:47.959 --> 24:49.000
Mm-hmm.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.417
Or do his nerves
get the better of him,

24:51.417 --> 24:54.083
and he comes apart
like a cheap suit?

24:54.083 --> 24:56.584
Captain Lee hired me to this
position because he trusts me,

24:56.584 --> 24:59.209
and so I would hope that
Captain Lee would also respect

24:59.209 --> 25:02.125
my decision that Jake would
make a good lead deckhand,

25:02.125 --> 25:05.167
because right now, I'm a
----ing three-stripe bosun,

25:05.167 --> 25:07.209
and I'm ready to move
off the deck.

25:07.209 --> 25:09.000
He's a goofy guy,
but you know,

25:09.000 --> 25:10.834
I think he's got a really
good head on his shoulders,

25:10.834 --> 25:12.542
and the other deckhands
look up to him.

25:12.542 --> 25:14.542
If I have someone up there
that I can rely on

25:14.542 --> 25:16.626
and that can get me
off deck a little bit

25:16.626 --> 25:19.083
and get me in here to learn,
that'd be a win.

25:19.083 --> 25:21.209
-It's a roll of the dice.
-Yeah.

25:21.209 --> 25:23.167
I hope I don't regret this...
get him up here.

25:23.167 --> 25:25.709
Jake, Jake, Eddie, can you
come to the wheelhouse, please?

25:25.709 --> 25:27.083
Yeah, copy.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.209
But if I do regret it,
so will you.

25:29.209 --> 25:33.834
Okay.

25:33.834 --> 25:35.542
Coming up...

25:35.542 --> 25:38.167
Get your ass up and get the
[bleep] down these stairs.

25:38.167 --> 25:39.167
Oh, my God.

25:39.167 --> 25:40.167
Hurry up.

25:40.167 --> 25:41.417
Pitter-patter, mother----er.

25:41.417 --> 25:42.751
Somebody can go [bleep]
right off,

25:42.751 --> 25:42.751
as far as
I'm ----ing concerned.

25:42.751 --> 25:46.209
I dunno about you,
I'm ready for a cock... oh!

25:46.209 --> 25:49.083
He's a goofy guy, but you know,

25:49.083 --> 25:50.209
I think he's got a really
good head on his shoulders.

25:50.209 --> 25:53.167
Well, I hope
I don't regret this.

25:53.167 --> 25:55.042
Jake, Jake, Eddie.
Come to the wheelhouse, please.

25:55.042 --> 25:56.876
Yeah, copy.

25:56.876 --> 25:59.417
But if I do regret it,
so will you.

25:59.417 --> 26:01.000
Okay.

26:01.000 --> 26:03.000
-How you doing, bud?
-Yeah, all good, thank you.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.000
Well, listen, Cap and
I were just sitting here

26:04.000 --> 26:05.834
talking about you.

26:05.834 --> 26:07.709
We wanna give you the
opportunity to be lead deckhand.

26:07.709 --> 26:09.709
I'd love to take it, if
you guys think I'm up to it.

26:09.709 --> 26:10.792
That's great.
You got a big day tomorrow.

26:10.792 --> 26:12.125
-Yeah.
-You got the luau.

26:12.125 --> 26:14.167
We really want you to take that
and get your deck team in order,

26:14.167 --> 26:15.125
and make sure everything runs
as smoothly as possible.

26:15.125 --> 26:17.000
Thank you.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.792
You got this team under you
that doesn't have

26:18.792 --> 26:20.125
the same experience you have,
but I think you can lead them,

26:20.125 --> 26:21.125
and that's what both
of us wanna see.

26:21.125 --> 26:22.667
I can do that for sure.

26:22.667 --> 26:24.083
And do something
about that hair.

26:24.083 --> 26:26.292
Try to keep it as nice
as your moustache.

26:26.292 --> 26:28.209
Really happy that Captain Lee
finally saw the light

26:28.209 --> 26:30.209
and that we got a lead deckhand.

26:30.209 --> 26:32.083
I'm already gonna look
like a leather bag

26:32.083 --> 26:34.083
by the time I'm 60,
so, thank you, Cap.

26:34.083 --> 26:35.876
-Thank you.
-Do me well.

26:35.876 --> 26:36.918
-Swear to God, you better.
-Thank you, Captain.

26:36.918 --> 26:38.125
-Cheers.
-You're welcome.

26:38.125 --> 26:39.709
-Thank you.
-It's a roll of the dice.

26:39.709 --> 26:41.125
-Yeah.
-Do you feel lucky?

26:41.125 --> 26:46.083
No, never.

26:46.083 --> 26:48.125
-Thank you so much.
-Pleasure.

26:48.125 --> 26:51.542
Jess, do you wanna jump down
to Colin and Justin's cabin

26:51.542 --> 26:53.876
and just give it
a spruce, please?

26:53.876 --> 26:56.751
Is it ready for
a turndown, or no?

26:56.751 --> 26:57.959
Hey, Richards, you
can go [bleep] yourself

26:57.959 --> 26:59.209
whenever you want from me.

26:59.209 --> 27:00.209
Would you get me
a bourbon, please?

27:00.209 --> 27:01.334
Nope.

27:01.334 --> 27:02.709
Did I hear someone
yell for a bourbon?

27:02.709 --> 27:03.709
-Yes, please.
-Are you ready?

27:03.709 --> 27:06.125
Yep!

27:06.125 --> 27:07.709
What happened?

27:07.709 --> 27:09.125
They gave me lead deckhand.

27:09.125 --> 27:10.792
Yes! Ah!

27:10.792 --> 27:12.209
[radio feedback]

27:12.209 --> 27:14.375
Oh, the captain's gonna kill me.

27:14.375 --> 27:17.167
Jake being the lead deckhand
is a great idea.

27:17.167 --> 27:18.209
Cheers, thank you very much.

27:18.209 --> 27:19.959
Yeah, man, absolutely.

27:19.959 --> 27:23.042
Perfect for me, because what
is he gonna do, yell at me?

27:23.042 --> 27:26.000
That's not possible,
he just kissed me.

27:26.000 --> 27:29.167
See this guy?

27:29.167 --> 27:31.000
Oh, yeah!

27:31.000 --> 27:33.918
I think Jake is a pretty
solid bet as lead deckhand.

27:33.918 --> 27:35.792
I mean, it's mostly
the moustache,

27:35.792 --> 27:37.209
and that thing
commands respect.

27:37.209 --> 27:38.751
So, I'm all for it.

27:38.751 --> 27:42.751
I wonder how he gets
his moustache so dark?

27:42.751 --> 27:46.667
I don't know, gotta ask him.

27:46.667 --> 27:48.125
[laughing]

27:48.125 --> 27:50.042
I hate these pillowcases.

27:50.042 --> 27:53.292
So, where's Richard?

27:53.292 --> 27:56.000
-There he is.
-Richard.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.334
No, I was not.
I was on the--

27:58.334 --> 27:59.334
We didn't know where you were.

27:59.334 --> 28:00.959
I would not go in there.

28:00.959 --> 28:01.959
How many pounds lighter
are you right now?

28:01.959 --> 28:03.083
I would not go in there.

28:03.083 --> 28:04.250
We'll talk about
that tomorrow, okay?

28:04.250 --> 28:06.042
Okay.

28:06.042 --> 28:07.042
Hey, are we supposed to put
white clothes on right now?

28:07.042 --> 28:08.709
Well, I don't want to.

28:08.709 --> 28:10.125
-Why do you not want to?
-We could.

28:10.125 --> 28:11.250
Because I don't wanna
----ing change, actually.

28:11.250 --> 28:12.918
Not one Goddamn bit.

28:12.918 --> 28:14.209
I'm gonna go change.

28:14.209 --> 28:15.417
Well, it's a white dinner
tonight.

28:15.417 --> 28:20.125
I'm gonna go change into
some rainbow sh--.

28:20.125 --> 28:22.209
-Yeah, he is.
-Goddamn it.

28:22.209 --> 28:25.334
-Whose side am I on?
-The side of sanity?

28:25.334 --> 28:27.209
-Where you going?
-I have to change.

28:27.209 --> 28:29.000
Your room is down here, Terri.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.751
This way? Okay.

28:30.751 --> 28:32.042
So is Justin's, for that matter.

28:32.042 --> 28:39.000
-Really?
-Yes.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.042
Yeah.

28:40.042 --> 28:41.792
Wes, may I be able to use you?

28:41.792 --> 28:43.000
Yeah, what's up?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.167
Add about that much mint here...

28:44.167 --> 28:46.000
-Mm-hmm.
-Here,

28:46.000 --> 28:50.959
and then it's gonna go
coriander, coriander, basil.

28:50.959 --> 28:53.125
So, I'm not gonna...

28:53.125 --> 28:54.417
I'm gonna tell you, I've never
done things in the kitchen.

28:54.417 --> 28:56.792
I don't care.

28:56.792 --> 28:58.042
What in the hell is that?

28:58.042 --> 28:59.709
Espresso martini.

28:59.709 --> 29:01.083
Jesus Christ, did you
wanna throw up

29:01.083 --> 29:03.417
on the boat tonight, or what?

29:03.417 --> 29:04.959
-Time for dinner.
-Is it time for dinner?

29:04.959 --> 29:06.042
Let's go.

29:06.042 --> 29:07.334
Two, four, six, eight.

29:07.334 --> 29:12.167
Oh, this is just wonderful.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.375
Still or sparkling?

29:13.375 --> 29:15.209
I would like more
bourbon, please.

29:15.209 --> 29:16.334
Beautiful.

29:16.334 --> 29:18.292
What in the high name
of hell is this?

29:18.292 --> 29:20.167
Captain Lee, the guests
are all seated

29:20.167 --> 29:21.292
and we're ready when you are.

29:21.292 --> 29:23.000
Copy that, thank you.

29:23.000 --> 29:24.000
Can I have a little
more bourbon in my...

29:24.000 --> 29:25.918
I would love to.

29:25.918 --> 29:27.792
-Where's Captain?
-Just be patient.

29:27.792 --> 29:29.042
I'm hungry.

29:29.042 --> 29:31.000
You still have
three full drinks.

29:31.000 --> 29:35.000
How about I be in
control of what I drink?

29:35.000 --> 29:37.375
-Who's that?
-That was Jake.

29:37.375 --> 29:38.626
Jesus.

29:38.626 --> 29:40.167
Oh, God.

29:40.167 --> 29:41.751
Has anybody ever told her
we can't take her anywhere?

29:41.751 --> 29:42.876
Are you talking
about yourself again?

29:42.876 --> 29:44.167
Because that's accurate, too.

29:44.167 --> 29:46.918
You have a Thermos at a
formal dinner on a yacht.

29:46.918 --> 29:48.125
Because I'm trying
to be efficient.

29:48.125 --> 29:49.626
-Hey!
-Good evening.

29:49.626 --> 29:51.626
-There he is!
-How's everybody tonight?

29:51.626 --> 29:52.751
-Good, how are you?
-I'm doing good.

29:52.751 --> 29:54.626
I'm gonna go into the soup.

29:54.626 --> 29:58.042
And does the soup
have a pairing, or no?

29:58.042 --> 30:00.167
Jess, can I get you to the
galley to help with service?

30:00.167 --> 30:01.125
On my way.

30:01.125 --> 30:02.042
Are you from Florida originally?

30:02.042 --> 30:03.959
-No, Michigan.
-So is Terri!

30:03.959 --> 30:05.626
I grew up in Ann Arbor.
I went to Ferris State.

30:05.626 --> 30:07.042
That's a nice college.

30:07.042 --> 30:08.209
Jesus, Terri,
you went to college?

30:08.209 --> 30:10.125
I wouldn't know it
by your mouth.

30:10.125 --> 30:12.542
I'm sorry, how many words
do you use a day?

30:12.542 --> 30:19.292
Usually they start
with [bleep] and "you."

30:19.292 --> 30:22.626
-These are ready to roll.
-I can carry this.

30:22.626 --> 30:23.626
I'm coming.

30:23.626 --> 30:24.751
This is amazing.

30:24.751 --> 30:26.584
What the hell is that?

30:26.584 --> 30:29.959
For our tasting, we've got
Tom Kha Gai with coconut milk,

30:29.959 --> 30:31.626
infused with lemongrass.

30:31.626 --> 30:33.417
This is accompanied with
a Woodford Reserve

30:33.417 --> 30:36.000
due to the fact that there is
a sweet, oaky palate on it

30:36.000 --> 30:38.042
with a hint of vanilla
that will coincide

30:38.042 --> 30:40.000
with the spiciness of the dish,
thank you.

30:40.000 --> 30:41.876
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

30:41.876 --> 30:43.459
There it is.

30:43.459 --> 30:45.167
-What'd you order?
-Apple juice with lime.

30:45.167 --> 30:46.918
Fair enough.

30:46.918 --> 30:48.626
I have no idea what I'm eating.

30:48.626 --> 30:49.667
It's got a little kick
to it, it's not bad.

30:49.667 --> 30:50.959
A little spicy.

30:50.959 --> 30:52.167
This is soup?

30:52.167 --> 30:59.959
Oh, and then you take
a drink of this.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.667
I'm smelling it.

31:01.667 --> 31:04.250
How the [bleep] do I eat this?

31:04.250 --> 31:06.209
Mm.

31:06.209 --> 31:09.083
[belching]

31:09.083 --> 31:12.125
So, if you can put
this in there to here.

31:12.125 --> 31:13.918
Okay.

31:13.918 --> 31:15.709
You've dealt with a bunch
of assholes, haven't you?

31:15.709 --> 31:17.042
On occasion.

31:17.042 --> 31:19.542
We're just a bunch of
real estate buffoons.

31:19.542 --> 31:20.918
Can I clear this glass?

31:20.918 --> 31:22.209
Absolutely not.

31:22.209 --> 31:23.125
Hold on a minute.

31:23.125 --> 31:24.959
So good.

31:24.959 --> 31:27.042
Notice how he's, like,
clutching his Thermos.

31:27.042 --> 31:29.000
Listen, I have not had
to ask anybody

31:29.000 --> 31:31.584
for a refill on my drink because
my ice is still original.

31:31.584 --> 31:33.876
You are at the fanciest dinner
of your entire life,

31:33.876 --> 31:35.542
and you have a Thermos...

31:35.542 --> 31:37.667
This is not the fanciest
dinner of my entire life.

31:37.667 --> 31:41.000
How do I get tequila down here?

31:41.000 --> 31:42.959
-Jesus Christ.
-No.

31:42.959 --> 31:44.834
We are in the middle
of a whiskey pairing.

31:44.834 --> 31:46.834
If you ask for tequila,
I will kill you.

31:46.834 --> 31:48.209
You can just go
[bleep] yourselves.

31:48.209 --> 31:50.209
-Justin.
-Stop.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.000
-Shut the [bleep] up.
-Stop.

31:52.000 --> 31:53.626
Okay, well, there you go.

31:53.626 --> 31:59.000
I'm throwing myself
off the boat.

31:59.000 --> 31:59.000
I'm hungry.

31:59.000 --> 32:03.125
He's a goofy guy, but you know,

32:03.125 --> 32:05.125
You all finished with dinner?

32:05.125 --> 32:06.292
No, actually,
I walked out of dinner.

32:06.292 --> 32:07.292
Oh, God, they're
gonna be pissed.

32:07.292 --> 32:08.959
Justin.

32:08.959 --> 32:11.209
What the French [bleep]
is going on, right?

32:11.209 --> 32:14.459
I ----ing hate that sh--.

32:14.459 --> 32:17.042
I'm ready to go in, like,
two minutes; not even.

32:17.042 --> 32:19.042
We're down a guy,
he left the table.

32:19.042 --> 32:21.209
What's going on, man?

32:21.209 --> 32:23.792
I can't ----ing stand sitting at
a formal ----ing dinner

32:23.792 --> 32:26.334
with a ----ing kiss-asses
for no asses.

32:26.334 --> 32:27.918
Oh, no.

32:27.918 --> 32:29.751
That guy's being
a petulant drunk.

32:29.751 --> 32:32.042
I'm sitting here just
trying to enjoy myself.

32:32.042 --> 32:33.959
I think you're doing
a fantastic job.

32:33.959 --> 32:35.209
I'm peanut butter
and jealous right now.

32:35.209 --> 32:37.834
Go, I'll be there in a second.

32:37.834 --> 32:40.167
Hello.

32:40.167 --> 32:41.167
Where's Justin at?

32:41.167 --> 32:45.209
Fancy ----ing dinner
can kiss my ass.

32:45.209 --> 32:46.959
Oh, my goodness,
this looks amazing.

32:46.959 --> 32:48.334
That girl down in
the galley is...

32:48.334 --> 32:50.042
-oh, that... that...
-Rachel!

32:50.042 --> 32:51.209
Yeah, that...

32:51.209 --> 32:52.959
that's the one
I was talking about.

32:52.959 --> 32:54.334
This beef is from
Buckhead, Georgia.

32:54.334 --> 32:56.334
It's signature 1855 filet,

32:56.334 --> 32:59.167
and so the bourbon will help
break down the fattiness.

32:59.167 --> 33:01.167
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

33:01.167 --> 33:03.209
-Hey, Captain Lee?
-Yes, sir.

33:03.209 --> 33:06.918
Where the [bleep]
did she come from?

33:06.918 --> 33:09.375
She was probably born,
like the rest of us.

33:09.375 --> 33:11.292
They're drunker'n a
four-peckered goat.

33:11.292 --> 33:16.083
I've never had anything
better in my mouth.

33:16.083 --> 33:18.250
They're drunker than a herd
of four-peckered goats.

33:18.250 --> 33:21.209
Morons.

33:21.209 --> 33:24.834
You look like a hatful of
assholes, and you're perfect.

33:24.834 --> 33:26.042
How are they doing?

33:26.042 --> 33:27.167
They're doing amazing right now.

33:27.167 --> 33:28.042
He said he's loving the steak.

33:28.042 --> 33:32.876
Awesome.

33:32.876 --> 33:36.459
Getting that anchor watch in.
Hell yeah, pure excitement.

33:36.459 --> 33:39.167
Oh ----ing good God.

33:39.167 --> 33:40.792
Thank you.

33:40.792 --> 33:42.292
This is gonna be
delightful, isn't it?

33:42.292 --> 33:46.792
This is a pad Thai sauce sautéed
down with lobster, poached.

33:46.792 --> 33:48.167
-It's absolutely stunning.
-This looks wonderful.

33:48.167 --> 33:50.876
Thanks, Rachel.

33:50.876 --> 33:55.167
Son of a bitch.

33:55.167 --> 33:56.292
Can I get you anything?

33:56.292 --> 33:57.918
You know what,
here's what I want.

33:57.918 --> 33:59.292
I would like my dinner here.

33:59.292 --> 34:00.501
I can do that.

34:00.501 --> 34:02.000
This guy's so litty-titty,

34:02.000 --> 34:03.959
and that's why
I don't drink whiskey.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.000
Never give me whiskey.

34:05.000 --> 34:06.042
I'm like a Goddamn gremlin.

34:06.042 --> 34:07.834
I once started
a fight with a Jeep.

34:07.834 --> 34:08.959
It was parked, no one was in it,
kicked the tires.

34:08.959 --> 34:10.209
It was like [bleep] you, Jeep!

34:10.209 --> 34:12.918
I do handle my alcohol well,
just not whiskey.

34:12.918 --> 34:14.417
Hey, Rachel,
Justin's on the swim platform,

34:14.417 --> 34:16.834
and he would like his dinner.

34:16.834 --> 34:18.959
Sure, you need to roll
up a napkin, a tray...

34:18.959 --> 34:20.250
-Yeah.
-Okay, let me go grab a tray.

34:20.250 --> 34:23.042
Okay, awesome.

34:23.042 --> 34:24.292
-What does your wife do?
-Nothing.

34:24.292 --> 34:25.918
She's paid her dues.

34:25.918 --> 34:30.167
She has to put up with your ass.

34:30.167 --> 34:31.250
Is she in did you say Florida?

34:31.250 --> 34:34.042
-Ft. Lauderdale.
-Okay.

34:34.042 --> 34:36.125
It's a horrible place
to live, isn't it?

34:36.125 --> 34:38.250
I love Florida.

34:38.250 --> 34:41.751
-Oh, yeah.
-Yes.

34:41.751 --> 34:44.000
Justin wants to have his
dinner on the swim platform.

34:44.000 --> 34:45.792
What?

34:45.792 --> 34:47.000
Bon appetito.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Kiss my ----ing ass.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.792
-Hey there.
-Hi.

34:49.792 --> 34:51.209
I'm gonna set up a little
table for you.

34:51.209 --> 34:53.167
God, I ----ing love you.

34:53.167 --> 34:56.209
Ugh... well, let's do that.

34:56.209 --> 34:58.334
-Fraser, Heather.
-G
o ahead, Heather.

34:58.334 --> 35:00.209
If I could send you
down to cabins.

35:00.209 --> 35:01.334
Copy that, on my way.

35:01.334 --> 35:04.000
We have warm ones in the master;
keep those cold.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.125
Pardon?

35:05.125 --> 35:06.209
I'm just saying there's...

35:06.209 --> 35:07.834
don't put the cold one down,

35:07.834 --> 35:08.959
because it's just gonna
leave a stain.

35:08.959 --> 35:09.959
-I have warm Evian.
-Yeah.

35:09.959 --> 35:14.959
[bleep] me.

35:14.959 --> 35:16.167
Hardly.

35:16.167 --> 35:17.125
Do you know what it is, babe?

35:17.125 --> 35:18.459
What?

35:18.459 --> 35:19.918
It's the tone of voice
that's used.

35:19.918 --> 35:21.000
You don't like it?

35:21.000 --> 35:22.083
No, I really don't.

35:22.083 --> 35:23.417
I just try and ignore her.

35:23.417 --> 35:25.417
Fraser's entitled
to his opinions,

35:25.417 --> 35:26.501
and I can understand it.

35:26.501 --> 35:28.125
I feel the same way sometimes.

35:28.125 --> 35:30.000
But you just have to put
all your feelings

35:30.000 --> 35:32.083
into a little balloon
and go whew...

35:32.083 --> 35:33.876
you let it go.
Bye!

35:33.876 --> 35:35.042
I'm just happy that
I'm not the only one

35:35.042 --> 35:36.250
who finds her so difficult.

35:36.250 --> 35:37.751
Yeah, no, it's not you.

35:37.751 --> 35:41.083
-How's it going?
-Peachy keen.

35:41.083 --> 35:43.209
Oh, my God.

35:43.209 --> 35:44.918
It looks good,
that looks really organized.

35:44.918 --> 35:46.459
Good, because it wasn't.

35:46.459 --> 35:48.042
I don't wanna eat up there.
I hate that sh-- .

35:48.042 --> 35:49.042
-I can't stand...
-I know.

35:49.042 --> 35:50.083
-Oop.
-It's okay.

35:50.083 --> 35:51.876
Hold on, how do we fix that?

35:51.876 --> 35:55.167
I'll go grab you some more.

35:55.167 --> 35:56.167
-Do we have his meal?
-Yeah.

35:56.167 --> 35:57.501
Thank you very much.

35:57.501 --> 36:00.167
I feel really fat right now.

36:00.167 --> 36:02.167
-Thank you very much.
-You're very welcome, enjoy.

36:02.167 --> 36:04.959
I don't know what I'm eating.

36:04.959 --> 36:06.209
Where did you go to school?

36:06.209 --> 36:07.417
-In Michigan.
-Really?

36:07.417 --> 36:11.125
-Did you grow up in that area?
-Saginaw.

36:11.125 --> 36:14.042
I worked in Saginaw,
everything, and Detroit.

36:14.042 --> 36:17.209
So, where did you grow up?

36:17.209 --> 36:19.167
Michigan.

36:19.167 --> 36:20.959
It's so interesting, because
we grew up in the same place.

36:20.959 --> 36:26.918
We did.

36:26.918 --> 36:28.167
Super annoying.

36:28.167 --> 36:35.209
Oh, my God, this is so good.

36:35.209 --> 36:36.751
You all done?

36:36.751 --> 36:38.501
Yeah?

36:38.501 --> 36:39.709
It was delicious, by the way.

36:39.709 --> 36:47.334
Good.

36:47.334 --> 36:49.709
Well, if you will excuse me,
thank you for dinner.

36:49.709 --> 36:50.876
Thank you very much
for joining us tonight.

36:50.876 --> 36:52.876
Thank you for having me.

36:52.876 --> 36:57.125
And we... well, you know, yeah,
it's our pleasure, really.

36:57.125 --> 37:00.042
I'll take my ----ing bourbon in
a ----ing coffee cup, thank you.

37:00.042 --> 37:02.334
-Good night.
-Get some rest.

37:02.334 --> 37:04.375
You looked like you were
having your teeth pulled.

37:04.375 --> 37:06.167
Like I had two root canals.

37:06.167 --> 37:08.375
Oh, my God, that was a disaster.

37:08.375 --> 37:11.959
No way.

37:11.959 --> 37:13.792
-What happened?
-That was brutal.

37:13.792 --> 37:16.959
I don't know how many times
she told me she's from Michigan.

37:16.959 --> 37:20.375
And Justin, that boy
is just flat-out rude.

37:20.375 --> 37:22.042
I'd rather be hanging out
with you ----ing people.

37:22.042 --> 37:23.876
I don't give a sh--.

37:23.876 --> 37:25.167
Dinner was very good, though.

37:25.167 --> 37:26.167
-It was great.
-Thank you.

37:26.167 --> 37:27.167
Okay.
I'm outta here, kids.

37:27.167 --> 37:28.334
See you in the morning, Cap.

37:28.334 --> 37:29.918
I'm gonna dream about Michigan.

37:29.918 --> 37:31.417
[laughing]

37:31.417 --> 37:33.083
Jess, Jess, Heather.

37:33.083 --> 37:34.083
Go down for the night.

37:34.083 --> 37:35.417
Thank you so much.

37:35.417 --> 37:37.042
I'm going to head to bed.

37:37.042 --> 37:38.209
See you shortly, my dear.

37:38.209 --> 37:40.125
Good night, Beetlejuice.

37:40.125 --> 37:41.876
Tomorrow.

37:41.876 --> 37:44.292
Tomorrow, I feel like
we're gonna be rock stars.

37:44.292 --> 37:45.959
Durham, go to bed.

37:45.959 --> 37:48.209
-Durham, Durham, go to bed.
-[hiccups]

37:48.209 --> 37:49.250
What?

37:49.250 --> 37:50.417
You should go to bed.

37:50.417 --> 37:53.250
I'm doing it.
[hiccups]

37:53.250 --> 37:55.375
Excuse me.

37:55.375 --> 37:57.000
Good night, good sir.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.000
Night-night.

37:59.000 --> 38:02.918
Oh, my God.

38:02.918 --> 38:03.918
You have a great evening.

38:03.918 --> 38:06.876
Thank you.

38:06.876 --> 38:10.083
[hiccups]

38:10.083 --> 38:12.417
I want something to drink.

38:12.417 --> 38:14.042
-Richards.
-What?

38:14.042 --> 38:16.167
What the [bleep] are you
doing, you dumb...

38:16.167 --> 38:17.584
Jesus Christ.

38:17.584 --> 38:19.125
I swear to God, I will kill him.

38:19.125 --> 38:21.292
He missed a lovely lobster...

38:21.292 --> 38:23.167
No, I just ate my dinner
down here,

38:23.167 --> 38:24.542
so go [bleep] yourself,
dickhead.

38:24.542 --> 38:26.125
[laughing]

38:26.125 --> 38:28.125
Go [bleep] yourself and
throw yourself off the...

38:28.125 --> 38:32.792
No, you can [bleep] yourself,
right now.

38:32.792 --> 38:33.792
Asshole.

38:33.792 --> 38:35.876
Hey, Terri, no.

38:35.876 --> 38:37.042
There she goes.

38:37.042 --> 38:38.083
-Eddie?
-Yes?

38:38.083 --> 38:39.459
What is going on down here?

38:39.459 --> 38:41.292
He's just sitting out.

38:41.292 --> 38:45.125
----ing dick.

38:45.125 --> 38:46.959
Justin, what are you doing?

38:46.959 --> 38:48.459
Sitting my ass on the
----ing back of the boat.

38:48.459 --> 38:50.292
Are you ----ing kidding
me right now?

38:50.292 --> 38:52.459
Justin, look at me,
in the... in my eyes...

38:52.459 --> 38:53.876
go [bleep] yourself.

38:53.876 --> 38:55.209
Okay.

38:55.209 --> 38:56.876
No!

38:56.876 --> 38:59.209
I'm gonna kill somebody.

38:59.209 --> 39:01.125
I'm just comfortable as
----ing sh-- down here.

39:01.125 --> 39:02.167
No, you're not comfortable,
you're being

39:02.167 --> 39:03.459
a ----ing jackass right now.

39:03.459 --> 39:05.876
-No... no, I am not.
-Are you kidding me?

39:05.876 --> 39:05.876
No.

39:05.876 --> 39:15.542
You all finished with dinner?

39:15.542 --> 39:18.209
I'm just comfortable
as ----ing sh-- down here.

39:18.209 --> 39:19.501
No, you're not comfortable,

39:19.501 --> 39:20.626
you're being a ----ing
jackass right now.

39:20.626 --> 39:21.751
No, no, I am not.

39:21.751 --> 39:23.000
Justin, are you kidding me?

39:23.000 --> 39:25.125
No.

39:25.125 --> 39:30.209
I love guest drama, because
it's not my drama, finally!

39:30.209 --> 39:33.334
I'm wonderful and comfortable.

39:33.334 --> 39:34.334
Okay, cool, cool, cool.

39:34.334 --> 39:35.459
All right.

39:35.459 --> 39:36.542
-How are you doing?
-Good.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.167
Hey, girl.

39:38.167 --> 39:46.667
Oop!

39:46.667 --> 39:48.042
I wish I was there for that.

39:48.042 --> 39:49.918
I don't like you right now.

39:49.918 --> 39:52.459
I wish I could muster up a
give a [bleep] about that.

39:52.459 --> 39:57.626
You did not show up to what
we are doing right now,

39:57.626 --> 39:58.626
and that's bullsh--.

39:58.626 --> 40:00.083
Can you unpack that for me?

40:00.083 --> 40:03.167
We were all in a ----ing
dinner, and you were...

40:03.167 --> 40:04.417
well, I don't know what
the [bleep] you were doing,

40:04.417 --> 40:07.083
but you did not show up.

40:07.083 --> 40:08.292
Unpack it further.

40:08.292 --> 40:10.876
No, I don't have to
pack it unfurther.

40:10.876 --> 40:12.876
I said "unpack," not
"pack it further."

40:12.876 --> 40:14.250
Heather, Heather, Fraser.

40:14.250 --> 40:16.083
You really wanna see this,
come upstairs.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.167
We've got drama.

40:17.167 --> 40:18.167
-We came on here...
-No.

40:18.167 --> 40:20.000
...as a family, and you
were not there.

40:20.000 --> 40:27.209
-Did we really?
-Go [bleep] off.

40:27.209 --> 40:28.834
Like, of all the ----ing
people in the group,

40:28.834 --> 40:30.000
I ----ing love you the most.

40:30.000 --> 40:31.876
Are you ----ing kidding me?

40:31.876 --> 40:34.417
I think that Terri and
Justin are secretly ----ing

40:34.417 --> 40:36.083
and none of their friends know.

40:36.083 --> 40:37.876
But she's the dominant here,

40:37.876 --> 40:40.042
and he's finally
drunkenly getting angry

40:40.042 --> 40:41.918
and being like, no, bitch,
go [bleep] off.

40:41.918 --> 40:43.083
-Nope.
-Yep.

40:43.083 --> 40:45.792
I run this show, all right?
It's me.

40:45.792 --> 40:49.501
No more pegging, no more
screaming, I'm in charge here.

40:49.501 --> 40:51.125
Drop it, Terri.

40:51.125 --> 40:52.375
If you wanna get ----ing
pissed about it,

40:52.375 --> 40:53.501
just watch how ----ing
confident...

40:53.501 --> 40:55.125
Done. I'm done.

40:55.125 --> 40:56.417
Just watch how Goddamn
confident I am

40:56.417 --> 40:59.292
sitting here happy as
----ing [bleep].

40:59.292 --> 41:01.042
Justin!

41:01.042 --> 41:02.334
Shut up and listen to me
for a second.

41:02.334 --> 41:04.125
No!

41:04.125 --> 41:07.042
Come back to the stairs, you can
hear everything word for word.

41:07.042 --> 41:09.209
I cannot believe you're
doing this right now.

41:09.209 --> 41:11.083
Wait, is something
good happening?

41:11.083 --> 41:13.626
I'm missing it.

41:13.626 --> 41:16.375
You just, like
----ing [bleep] everything.

41:16.375 --> 41:18.167
They're just really not chic.

41:18.167 --> 41:20.209
They probably won
this trip

41:20.209 --> 41:23.167
from some form of lottery
or something, I don't know.

41:23.167 --> 41:25.125
I'm gonna do a favor, okay?

41:25.125 --> 41:27.000
No, don't do me a favor.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.209
I'm not asking you to
do a ----ing favor.

41:28.209 --> 41:31.000
You ----ing know better
than that, okay?

41:31.000 --> 41:33.876
I'm gonna walk you back to
your ----ing room,

41:33.876 --> 41:35.375
and you're gonna shut
the [bleep] up.

41:35.375 --> 41:39.125
They don't belong on a yacht.

41:39.125 --> 41:40.959
What?

41:40.959 --> 41:43.209
Get your ass up and get
the [bleep] down these stairs.

41:43.209 --> 41:46.042
Oh, my God.

41:46.042 --> 41:48.417
Hurry up, pitter-patter,
mother----er, let's go.

41:48.417 --> 41:50.792
No ----ing [bleep].

41:50.792 --> 41:53.209
You crouching tiger,
hidden stew?

41:53.209 --> 41:56.042
Son of a bitch, this is a
whole ----ing circus.

41:56.042 --> 41:57.626
Everybody can go [bleep]
right off

41:57.626 --> 41:59.042
as far as I'm ----ing concerned.

41:59.042 --> 42:01.167
I'm just nervous
something's gonna happen

42:01.167 --> 42:04.167
that we can't control.

42:04.167 --> 42:05.125
Can I get you anything?

42:05.125 --> 42:07.083
-Nope.
-Okay.

42:07.083 --> 42:10.959
Nope.

42:10.959 --> 42:12.167
No sh--. What do you
want me to do?

42:12.167 --> 42:15.083
No, nope, come here.

42:15.083 --> 42:19.125
Stop it.
Stop it.

42:19.125 --> 42:20.334
She needs to go away, now.

42:20.334 --> 42:22.167
-Stop.
-Pardon?

42:22.167 --> 42:24.125
She needs to go away.

42:24.125 --> 42:25.250
What does "go" mean?

42:25.250 --> 42:26.501
Can you elaborate a little more?

42:26.501 --> 42:28.209
She needs to go in
her ----ing...

42:28.209 --> 42:29.918
her room and
shut the [bleep] up.

42:29.918 --> 42:32.584
Justin is just out of
control and overly aggressive.

42:32.584 --> 42:35.292
This is absolutely unacceptable
behavior from a charter guest.

42:35.292 --> 42:36.417
It's dangerous.

42:36.417 --> 42:38.167
I think it's best we all just...

42:38.167 --> 42:39.542
No, go [bleep] yourself and
throw yourself off the boat.

42:39.542 --> 42:40.584
Take a walk...

42:40.584 --> 42:43.000
[sobbing]

42:43.000 --> 42:44.167
-Two fingers, or one?
-Three, actually.

42:44.167 --> 42:50.125
Hold on...
no, come here.

42:50.125 --> 42:51.167
What the [bleep]?

42:51.167 --> 42:53.083
She needs...
she needs to go.

42:53.083 --> 42:54.501
So, maybe it's just best if
you just kind of just,

42:54.501 --> 42:56.083
like, stay away from
each other right now.

42:56.083 --> 42:57.542
-Just, like,...
-Bullsh--.

42:57.542 --> 42:59.667
-We can't...
-No, can I stop them?

42:59.667 --> 43:01.334
There'll be somebody jumping off
this boat tonight.

43:01.334 --> 43:02.542
[bleep].
