00:23.273 --> 00:25.899
Friends, let me introduce myself.

00:26.276 --> 00:28.485
Peltzer's the name.
Rand Peltzer.

00:29.070 --> 00:30.904
That's me there on the corner.

00:31.531 --> 00:32.906
I'm an inventor.

00:33.199 --> 00:35.284
And I have a story to tell.

00:35.618 --> 00:38.078
I know.
Who hasn't got a story?

00:38.329 --> 00:41.165
Well, nobody's got a story
like this one.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.042
Nobody.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.794
It all started here in Chinatown.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.797
I was trying
to move a little merchandise...

00:49.049 --> 00:51.383
...maybe find a present
for my kid.

00:51.676 --> 00:53.802
I tried this one place.

00:58.433 --> 01:00.100
Wait a minute.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.227
What's down here?

01:02.437 --> 01:03.645
This is it.

01:03.938 --> 01:06.315
This is your grandfather's store?

01:07.317 --> 01:08.567
Come on.

01:10.153 --> 01:13.072
No wonder you gotta drag
people in off the street.

01:18.745 --> 01:20.954
Go ahead, mister.
Look around.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.332
See if there's something you like.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.228
Are these things real?

01:44.437 --> 01:47.064
I told you, everything's real.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.860
You do have
interesting artifacts here...

01:52.112 --> 01:53.946
...but there's one thing
you don't have.

01:54.197 --> 01:55.364
And what's that?

01:55.740 --> 01:58.992
Let me show you.
I'm an inventor. I made this.

01:59.619 --> 02:02.788
The Bathroom Buddy.
The invention of the century.

02:03.039 --> 02:07.376
It eliminates the need to carry
heavy luggage when you travel.

02:07.669 --> 02:10.545
You got yourself
your shaving mirror...

02:10.755 --> 02:14.883
...your toothbrush, a toothpick.
You got toenail clippers...

02:15.885 --> 02:16.969
...a nail file...

02:17.303 --> 02:19.805
...and you got yourself
a dental mirror.

02:20.014 --> 02:22.182
This is gonna revolutionize traveling.

02:22.684 --> 02:25.269
Let's just say,
for the sake of argument...

02:25.520 --> 02:27.896
...that you're on a bus,
a plane or a train.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.233
You forgot to brush your teeth.

02:31.901 --> 02:35.404
You got yourself a bad case
of dragon breath.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.448
Bad breath.

02:38.658 --> 02:40.033
What do you do?

02:40.201 --> 02:42.828
No problem, friend.
All you do is...

02:43.079 --> 02:44.746
...you take your toothbrush out...

02:45.123 --> 02:46.707
...and you push this button.

02:48.209 --> 02:50.043
That's absolutely no problem.

02:50.753 --> 02:52.796
Cleans up easily.

02:53.047 --> 02:55.924
What I'd like to do, sir,
is give you my card.

02:56.176 --> 02:59.428
Rand Peltzer. "Fantastic Ideas
for a Fantastic World. "

02:59.637 --> 03:01.138
I make the illogical logical.

03:02.015 --> 03:03.724
I can get you these.

03:04.017 --> 03:06.310
I can get them by the dozen
if you'd like.

03:10.315 --> 03:14.943
What do you think?

03:18.281 --> 03:19.948
Where's that coming from?

03:39.135 --> 03:40.135
What is that?

03:40.303 --> 03:41.511
Mogwai.

03:44.849 --> 03:45.974
What's he doing?

03:46.226 --> 03:47.392
Singing.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.312
He does that sometimes.

03:56.277 --> 03:58.820
I gotta have him.
He's incredible.

03:59.822 --> 04:01.114
Tell you what I'll do.

04:01.366 --> 04:04.243
- I'll give you $100 for him.
No.

04:04.661 --> 04:07.788
I've gotta have him. It's
a present for my son for Christmas.

04:07.997 --> 04:09.748
It's what I've been looking for.

04:09.999 --> 04:12.501
I've been everywhere.
I'll give you $200.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.211
That's $200!

04:14.587 --> 04:15.837
I'm sorry.

04:16.214 --> 04:19.091
Mogwai not for sale.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.678
You said everything here was for sale.

04:22.887 --> 04:23.887
Grandfather!

04:24.097 --> 04:27.849
With mogwai comes much responsibility.

04:28.059 --> 04:31.395
I cannot sell him at any price.

04:37.235 --> 04:40.028
Wait outside. I'll be right out.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.613
Just go.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.126
Okay, mister, here it is.

04:55.253 --> 04:56.545
What about your grandfather?

04:56.713 --> 04:59.548
Forget what he said. He's crazy.
We need the money.

04:59.716 --> 05:01.216
Do you want it or not?

05:01.426 --> 05:02.676
I want it.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.097
There's three rules
you've gotta follow.

05:07.348 --> 05:08.724
What kind of rules?

05:09.058 --> 05:10.392
Keep him out of the light.

05:10.601 --> 05:13.562
He hates bright light,
especially sunlight.

05:13.730 --> 05:14.938
It'll kill him.

05:15.148 --> 05:18.734
And keep him away from water.
Don't get him wet.

05:18.943 --> 05:22.738
But the most important rule,
the rule you can never forget...

05:22.947 --> 05:26.199
...no matter how much he cries
or how much he begs...

05:26.451 --> 05:30.287
...never, never feed him
after midnight. Got it?

05:30.496 --> 05:31.872
Sure. Whatever you say.

05:32.081 --> 05:34.875
Thanks.
And have a merry Christmas.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.469
You're rolling with
Rockin' Ricky Rialto...

05:45.720 --> 05:48.513
...the voice of Kingston Falls, U.S.A.!

06:22.006 --> 06:23.382
Alex...

06:23.800 --> 06:25.509
Getting close to Christmas.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.053
You'll get stuck
with a lot of trees again.

06:28.304 --> 06:31.348
I thought I'd see you about now.
Ow!

06:31.557 --> 06:32.933
What the hell is this?

06:33.893 --> 06:35.644
What are you doing in there?

06:35.895 --> 06:37.396
Don't ask.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.898
Alex, I came to get my tree.

06:40.149 --> 06:42.943
Pete, take that tree
to Mr. Anderson's truck.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.154
What do you say, Alex?

06:46.406 --> 06:48.490
You can spare one
for the sheriff's station.

06:48.699 --> 06:51.243
I paid for mine, Frank.

07:39.375 --> 07:41.001
Billy, you need a jump?

07:41.419 --> 07:44.504
No, thanks, Mr. Futterman.
I'm late for work as it is.

07:44.755 --> 07:47.591
These goddamn foreign cars
always freeze up on you.

07:47.925 --> 07:51.011
You don't find American
machinery doing that.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.429
See that plow?

07:52.805 --> 07:55.223
Hasn't given me a day's trouble
in 15 years.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.142
You know why?
Kentucky Harvester.

07:57.435 --> 08:01.521
It ain't some foreign piece of crap.
That's a Kentucky Harvester.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.025
If I wanna keep my job,
I should be going now.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.985
How's your comic strip coming?

08:07.445 --> 08:11.281
I expect to see you in the funnies
with "Smilin' Jack," "Li'I Abner. "

08:11.491 --> 08:13.783
They don't run those comics anymore.

08:13.993 --> 08:15.243
They don't?

08:15.661 --> 08:17.245
Come on, Barn.

08:17.747 --> 08:19.956
Say hello to your wife, okay?

08:20.166 --> 08:21.625
So long, Billy.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.089
Goddamn foreign cars.

08:52.615 --> 08:53.615
Hey, doctor.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.200
Morning, Billy.

09:16.222 --> 09:18.848
Morning, Tom.
Hey, Billy. Barney.

09:29.819 --> 09:32.320
Get in there and be quiet.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.174
- You just made it.
- Again.

09:53.759 --> 09:55.343
Will you sign this petition?

09:55.553 --> 09:57.429
Sure. What's it for?

09:57.638 --> 09:59.681
To declare Dorry's pub a landmark.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.350
Mrs. Deagle's trying to take
his lease away.

10:02.643 --> 10:03.685
His too?

10:03.853 --> 10:07.105
Yeah, she says it's a dive,
a public nuisance.

10:07.356 --> 10:09.357
That's where my dad
proposed to my mom.

10:09.525 --> 10:13.194
That's where everybody's dad
proposed to their mom. Cross your "T."

10:17.491 --> 10:18.533
Thanks.

10:26.125 --> 10:27.626
Good morning, Mrs. Deagle.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.461
What's good about it?

10:32.882 --> 10:34.090
Klutz!

10:36.886 --> 10:38.511
Watch it, watch it!

10:39.013 --> 10:41.890
40, 60, 80...

10:48.814 --> 10:51.274
Two hundred. Thank you.

10:51.734 --> 10:53.026
- Mrs. Deagle?
- What?

10:53.235 --> 10:56.196
I just wanted you to know
that Joe got another job.

10:56.447 --> 10:57.739
My husband, Joe Harris.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.699
And I've taken up some sewing.

10:59.950 --> 11:01.701
What are you trying to tell me?

11:02.244 --> 11:04.913
Neither of us will be paid
for two weeks.

11:05.122 --> 11:07.082
Couldn't you get Mr. Corben...

11:07.583 --> 11:09.459
...to give us a little more time?

11:09.669 --> 11:10.835
Mrs. Harris...

11:11.003 --> 11:13.296
...the bank and I have
the same purpose in life...

11:13.547 --> 11:15.423
...to make money.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.300
Not to support a lot of...

11:17.510 --> 11:18.677
...deadbeats.

11:20.137 --> 11:22.639
Mrs. Deagle, it's Christmas!

11:26.435 --> 11:29.729
Now you know what to ask Santa for,
don't you?

11:31.982 --> 11:33.608
Mommy, I'm hungry.

11:33.984 --> 11:36.236
Yes, honey. So am I.

11:41.992 --> 11:44.869
This is what's left
of my imported Bavarian snowman.

11:45.121 --> 11:47.872
Your dog broke it this morning!

11:49.500 --> 11:50.792
I'm terribly sorry.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.544
Tell me how much I owe you...

11:52.753 --> 11:54.337
I don't want money.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.467
I want your dog.

12:02.471 --> 12:03.722
Barney?

12:04.473 --> 12:06.516
Give him to me.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.853
I'll take him to the kennel.
They'll put him to sleep.

12:10.062 --> 12:13.356
It'll be quick and painless,
compared to what I could do to him.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.525
What could you do?

12:18.612 --> 12:21.281
I'll catch the beast myself.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.409
Then he'll get what he deserves.

12:24.618 --> 12:27.162
A slow, painful death.

12:28.289 --> 12:31.916
Maybe I'll put him in my spin dryer
on high heat.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.294
That'd do it.

12:37.715 --> 12:40.550
Barney!

12:42.178 --> 12:44.137
Barney, will you get off of her?

12:44.346 --> 12:46.931
My dear lady, are you all right?

12:47.141 --> 12:50.393
I have a very weak heart.
I can't stand a shock like that!

12:50.603 --> 12:52.562
What is that dog doing in here?

12:52.813 --> 12:54.522
This is a bank, not a pet store.

12:54.690 --> 12:55.690
Very good, Gerald.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.192
He wouldn't hurt you.

12:57.401 --> 13:00.320
Excuses, excuses.
You're just like your father.

13:00.613 --> 13:04.824
I've listened to his excuses
for 10 years, the loser!

13:05.034 --> 13:07.952
As for you, you mangy cur...

13:08.329 --> 13:10.038
...I'll get you...

13:10.873 --> 13:12.749
...when you least expect it!

13:13.209 --> 13:14.626
Oh, my heart!

13:14.877 --> 13:17.754
I must apologize
for this most unusual...

13:17.963 --> 13:19.631
You putz.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.720
The old bat never looked better.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.847
It's great. You're doing fine.

13:28.474 --> 13:29.682
Thanks.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.559
Hello, Gerald.

13:31.811 --> 13:34.854
If it isn't Captain Clip-on.

13:35.105 --> 13:38.483
Guess who almost applied
for unemployment today?

13:38.692 --> 13:40.985
- I give up.
- You.

13:41.195 --> 13:44.072
But Mr. Corben had second thoughts.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.908
He gets so sentimental
about the holidays.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.827
Imagine that.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.579
I would've fired you in a second.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.082
Merry Christmas to you too.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.125
Excuse me, Mr. Jones.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.462
Hey, Peltzer.

13:59.672 --> 14:02.799
Look, I'm a junior
vice president at 23.

14:03.008 --> 14:06.386
By the time I'm 25,
I'm gonna have Mr. Corben's job.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.972
By the time I'm 30,
I'll be a millionaire.

14:09.181 --> 14:10.807
Look at you.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.935
You're practically supporting
your whole family.

14:14.520 --> 14:16.187
The world's changing.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.857
You gotta change with it.
You gotta be tough.

14:19.275 --> 14:22.277
Tough? And no one's
tougher than you, Ger?

14:23.737 --> 14:25.947
Don't call me that.
My name's Gerald.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.448
Can I get you a drink?

14:27.658 --> 14:30.118
Give me a vodka martini.
Shake, don't stir.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.327
You work here?

14:31.537 --> 14:34.122
Weeknights so Dorry doesn't
have to pay an extra waitress.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.290
That's great.

14:35.457 --> 14:38.751
Yeah, that's swell, if you
like working for nothing.

14:38.961 --> 14:42.213
Two more rounds for the pool table,
on the house.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.216
You haven't seen my new apartment.

14:45.426 --> 14:47.260
I haven't seen your old apartment.

14:48.053 --> 14:51.806
We're talking cable.
Can we have dinner tomorrow night?

14:53.350 --> 14:54.726
I'm working.

14:55.728 --> 14:59.147
Why don't you tell Dorry
you're sick? He can't dock your pay.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.824
Billy, is that you?

15:10.034 --> 15:11.576
Yeah, Mom, it's me.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.745
I'm in the kitchen.

15:15.831 --> 15:17.498
Merry Christmas!

15:21.086 --> 15:23.671
Merry Christmas, movie house!

15:24.089 --> 15:26.341
Merry Christmas, emporium!

15:26.842 --> 15:29.177
- Hi, Mom.
- Hi, sweetie.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.012
Do you need any help?

15:31.513 --> 15:33.389
Yeah, you could do the eggs.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.183
Thanks.

16:00.918 --> 16:04.963
Dad's machines work so well
the first couple of weeks, then...

16:05.214 --> 16:06.714
Use the sink.

16:12.304 --> 16:13.972
Is something wrong?

16:14.890 --> 16:17.100
No, it's a sad movie.

16:20.729 --> 16:22.063
How was your day?

16:22.272 --> 16:23.564
It was fine.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.528
Come on, what is it?
What's wrong?

16:29.363 --> 16:32.532
Mrs. Deagle called again
this afternoon.

16:36.954 --> 16:40.081
Let's not talk about it now.
Don't say anything to Dad.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.541
Fine with me.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.341
Hi, sweetheart!

16:52.803 --> 16:55.179
- Welcome home.
- Hey, Dad.

16:56.598 --> 16:59.017
I'm glad you're back.
How was the trip?

16:59.184 --> 17:00.184
It was great.

17:00.352 --> 17:03.062
The Miracle Company, who has
the Kitchen Companion...

17:03.272 --> 17:06.148
...might be interested
in the Bathroom Buddy.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.775
Great!

17:10.779 --> 17:12.320
- Thanks!
- You'll like this.

17:13.198 --> 17:14.866
What is it? A birdcage?

17:15.451 --> 17:18.911
No, don't shake it. Open it now.
It won't wait till Christmas.

17:22.165 --> 17:23.458
It's a puppy, isn't it?

17:24.126 --> 17:25.292
Yeah, I can tell.

17:25.502 --> 17:26.961
It's a new car.

17:33.093 --> 17:35.803
- Honey, would you dim the lights?
- Sure.

17:36.013 --> 17:38.389
Dim the lights?
Does it glow in the dark?

17:38.599 --> 17:41.100
It's important. Trust me.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.062
Go ahead, open it.

18:06.376 --> 18:07.668
What is it?

18:07.878 --> 18:09.462
It's your new pet.

18:09.671 --> 18:11.589
Come on, Barney.
Be a good dog.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.267
You're kidding.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.064
Dad, it's really neat.

18:31.193 --> 18:32.276
Where'd you get this?

18:32.528 --> 18:34.987
Some little junk store in Chinatown.

18:35.197 --> 18:38.199
- Can I pick him up?
- Sure, go ahead. Just be careful.

18:38.450 --> 18:39.992
- You gotta be gentle.
- I will.

18:41.161 --> 18:42.870
I hope he's housebroken.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.707
Isn't he cute?

18:48.210 --> 18:49.293
Has it got a name?

18:49.503 --> 18:50.711
Mogwai.

18:51.004 --> 18:53.005
- What?
Mogwai.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.217
Some Chinese word.
I just call him...

18:56.426 --> 18:59.011
...Gizmo.
He seems to like it.

19:03.559 --> 19:05.059
Look up here a minute.

19:06.186 --> 19:08.229
We're getting our picture taken.

19:08.438 --> 19:09.438
Smile.

19:09.690 --> 19:10.857
Ready?

19:11.066 --> 19:13.734
One, two, three...

19:15.070 --> 19:16.362
No, no.
Bright light!

19:16.572 --> 19:17.697
What happened?

19:17.906 --> 19:19.657
He hates bright lights.

19:20.450 --> 19:23.244
There's some important things
I forgot to tell you.

19:23.495 --> 19:28.583
Number one, he hates bright lights.
You gotta keep him out of the sunlight.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.918
Sunlight will kill him.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.754
Number two, keep him
away from water.

19:34.047 --> 19:39.093
Don't give him any water to drink.
Whatever you do, don't give him a bath.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.596
And the most important thing...

19:41.847 --> 19:45.725
...don't ever feed him
after midnight.

20:57.673 --> 20:58.673
Shh!

21:01.927 --> 21:03.344
Looks like you hurt yourself.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.473
Light bright! Light bright!

21:10.852 --> 21:14.981
Just sit down there
and don't fall off, okay?

21:15.190 --> 21:17.483
I'll get you fixed up in no time.

21:20.195 --> 21:21.862
All right.

21:22.864 --> 21:24.156
Hold still.

21:25.158 --> 21:27.493
Sorry. Sorry.

21:34.668 --> 21:37.086
Try not to move so much, okay?

21:55.105 --> 21:57.523
Good night, Giz.
I'll see you in the morning.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.284
Hello!

22:51.578 --> 22:52.912
Mrs. Peltzer?

22:55.957 --> 22:57.458
I got a tree!

22:58.460 --> 23:00.294
Oh, Christ!

23:01.963 --> 23:03.756
Billy!

23:08.720 --> 23:11.305
I just brought in
your Christmas tree.

23:11.556 --> 23:13.099
What happened?

23:13.308 --> 23:16.394
Slight problem
with the Peltzer Peeler-Juicer.

23:16.603 --> 23:19.063
I thought your dad fixed it.

23:19.272 --> 23:20.940
I thought so too.

23:22.818 --> 23:26.570
You should just buy orange juice
in cartons. It's a lot easier.

23:27.781 --> 23:29.698
See, it works.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.081
I had to come.
So I see.

23:37.290 --> 23:39.250
Now I can see. It takes...

23:39.459 --> 23:41.001
...a certain kind of guy.

23:41.211 --> 23:44.088
And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.153
It's no problem, Pete.
Leave it up here.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.529
What'll you tell him?

24:08.780 --> 24:12.741
I'll just tell him a bunch of
bikers stole it from me on my way home.

24:16.037 --> 24:18.873
Wow! The Hooded Menace.
Issue number one!

24:19.124 --> 24:20.374
Pretty neat, huh?

24:20.625 --> 24:22.042
Where'd you get it?

24:22.752 --> 24:24.753
Dr. Fantasy's, I think.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.883
- What's that?
- Come here. I'll show you.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.552
This is my new pet.
My dad gave him to me.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.053
Neat! What's his name?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.556
His name's Gizmo. Hi, Giz.

24:35.765 --> 24:37.475
He's a mogwai.

24:44.065 --> 24:45.399
Cute!

24:49.404 --> 24:51.030
Blink your eyes.

24:51.406 --> 24:54.575
Go like that.
Can you do that?

25:01.082 --> 25:02.708
Watch. Maybe he'll sing.

25:03.502 --> 25:07.338
Come on, Giz.
Let's go over to the table.

25:07.589 --> 25:08.923
I'll be careful.

25:10.425 --> 25:12.301
There we go.

25:15.055 --> 25:18.015
Gee, Billy, where
can I get one of those?

25:18.225 --> 25:21.060
I don't know.
This is the only one I've ever seen.

25:22.103 --> 25:23.103
Can I hold him?

25:23.355 --> 25:27.107
Sure. I don't see why not.
He seems to like you.

25:28.235 --> 25:30.444
Great! Thanks a lot.

25:30.695 --> 25:31.904
Sorry.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.948
What was in that jar?

25:34.199 --> 25:35.699
Nothing! Just water!

25:36.868 --> 25:38.285
Why is he making that noise?

25:46.086 --> 25:47.670
What is it?

25:47.837 --> 25:48.963
I don't know.

25:53.635 --> 25:55.469
Is it alive?

25:56.054 --> 25:57.471
I don't know.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.908
One, two, three,
four, five new ones.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.661
Now can I have one?

27:02.912 --> 27:03.954
I don't know.

27:04.205 --> 27:06.707
Look, that one's got
a cute stripe on its head.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.047
Isn't that incredible, Pete?

27:13.340 --> 27:15.132
Yeah, great.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.552
Don't you think this...?
This is incredible!

27:19.554 --> 27:21.305
Oh, it is neat.

27:22.932 --> 27:24.725
I'm serious. It's neat.

27:28.730 --> 27:31.065
Gizmo, what's the matter?

27:45.538 --> 27:47.748
- No, no, no.
- Hey, Dad?

27:49.584 --> 27:52.086
- There's something I should tell you.
- Look.

27:52.253 --> 27:54.254
You're familiar
with the Bathroom Buddy?

27:54.506 --> 27:56.882
I have made an improvement.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.092
Watch this.

27:58.385 --> 28:02.262
Now, let's say you're
late for the big meeting.

28:02.472 --> 28:03.847
It's really important.

28:04.099 --> 28:08.060
You're on your way. You reach up.
You forgot to shave.

28:08.353 --> 28:11.271
What're you gonna do?
Under normal circumstances...

28:11.523 --> 28:13.273
...you are in trouble.

28:13.483 --> 28:16.235
But not if you have
the Bathroom Buddy.

28:16.945 --> 28:18.278
Watch this.

28:20.490 --> 28:21.865
What do you think?

28:22.575 --> 28:24.118
That's pretty neat.

28:25.787 --> 28:26.870
What's this button?

28:31.084 --> 28:32.626
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's okay.

28:32.794 --> 28:33.836
I'm sorry.

28:34.003 --> 28:37.548
It's not your fault. I'm working
on that. I haven't finished that.

28:37.757 --> 28:41.260
I came up here because
there's a problem with the mogwai.

28:41.469 --> 28:43.011
Yeah, what's that?

28:44.139 --> 28:46.306
It multiplies with water.

28:48.476 --> 28:49.560
What?

28:52.814 --> 28:54.398
Do you see what I mean?

28:55.150 --> 28:57.151
I don't believe that.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.278
All that from water?
They got wet?

28:59.487 --> 29:00.821
Plain water.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.327
It's funny.
The new ones aren't like Gizmo.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.663
The striped one
seems to be the leader.

29:09.831 --> 29:10.914
You know what?

29:11.332 --> 29:14.418
I'll bet every kid in America
would like one of these.

29:14.919 --> 29:17.171
They might replace
the dog as the family pet.

29:28.975 --> 29:30.017
Think about it.

29:30.310 --> 29:32.144
The Peltzer Pet.

29:34.105 --> 29:37.566
This could really be the big one.

29:58.338 --> 29:59.379
Barn?

30:01.508 --> 30:28.575
Barney?

30:31.120 --> 30:33.247
Barney, who did this to you?

30:33.540 --> 30:35.207
Hold on, I'll get you down.

30:35.416 --> 30:36.750
Stay still.

30:38.086 --> 30:41.588
Poor dog. Another minute
and he would've been a dog-sicle.

30:43.258 --> 30:47.219
All I know is that I'm positive
that I closed and locked the door.

30:48.555 --> 30:50.347
How else did she get to him?

30:50.557 --> 30:54.726
We can't point any fingers,
not even at Mrs. Deagle.

30:55.603 --> 30:58.897
She's been threatening him.
She'd love to get her hands on him.

30:59.107 --> 31:04.236
We don't have proof. We can't even
find footprints leading up to the house.

31:05.738 --> 31:08.949
I'm gonna take Barney
to your grandmother's.

31:09.242 --> 31:12.744
Take him there on the way to the
convention, pick him up on the way home.

31:12.954 --> 31:16.623
He'll be here for Christmas.
It'll be all right.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.298
I don't think we can drink this.

31:29.095 --> 31:30.596
Why not?

31:31.055 --> 31:32.681
What's wrong with this?

31:40.982 --> 31:42.316
Hey, Billy.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.151
Is that a mogwai?

31:44.319 --> 31:47.321
Yeah, I'm gonna have
Mr. Hanson check it out.

31:47.488 --> 31:51.241
And all of a sudden, there were
five new ones like this one.

31:52.911 --> 31:54.578
Now watch this.

32:31.824 --> 32:35.285
Can I keep one of these here,
run some tests on him?

32:36.537 --> 32:38.455
I think I can spare one.

32:47.757 --> 32:50.550
This is some Christmas,
Katie, I'll tell you.

32:50.760 --> 32:55.806
First the old bat closes the factory,
and now it's my goddamn plow.

32:56.015 --> 32:59.059
Mr. Futterman, guess what?
It's time to go home now.

32:59.268 --> 33:01.520
- How about one more beer?
- No, it's late.

33:01.729 --> 33:03.647
One more beer,
I'll help you clean up.

33:03.856 --> 33:06.566
No, thanks, though.
It'll be okay.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.030
- It'll be okay.
- It will not be okay.

33:12.240 --> 33:16.410
I brought my plow in for a tune-up
and found it loaded with foreign parts.

33:16.786 --> 33:19.913
I mean, everything.
Gaskets, pistons, spark plugs.

33:20.206 --> 33:21.999
All of it's foreign.

33:22.417 --> 33:24.251
Billy!
Hi.

33:26.379 --> 33:27.838
Going home?

33:28.214 --> 33:29.423
Oh, yeah.

33:33.553 --> 33:34.845
Gremlins!

33:36.180 --> 33:38.265
You gotta watch out for foreigners.

33:38.516 --> 33:40.809
They plant gremlins
in their machinery.

33:41.019 --> 33:44.855
The same gremlins brought down
our planes in the big one.

33:45.606 --> 33:47.065
That's right.

33:47.316 --> 33:48.817
World War II.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.027
Good old...

33:50.236 --> 33:52.612
...W- W-I-I.

33:56.576 --> 33:59.119
They're still shipping them over here.

33:59.328 --> 34:01.204
They put them in the cars, the TV.

34:01.414 --> 34:04.124
They put them in the radios
you stick in your ears.

34:04.417 --> 34:07.252
They put them in the watches.
Little teeny gremlins.

34:07.462 --> 34:10.964
It's not a good idea that you drive.
Why don't you walk home?

34:11.591 --> 34:14.384
You know, Katie, I think
maybe I'll walk home.

34:14.635 --> 34:17.637
- Good.
- It's a nice night.

34:21.809 --> 34:23.310
- Good night, kids.
- Good night.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.106
Gremlins.

34:54.675 --> 34:58.178
That was really good,
the way you handled Mr. Futterman.

34:58.596 --> 35:00.180
I'm used to it.

35:00.681 --> 35:03.517
He's been like that
ever since he lost his job.

35:04.435 --> 35:08.939
He's like a lot of people around here.
He just wants somebody to listen.

35:09.148 --> 35:11.024
Especially around the holidays.

35:12.193 --> 35:13.652
Why is that?

35:13.861 --> 35:16.696
It's when a lot of people
get really depressed.

35:18.032 --> 35:22.702
I always thought everyone was happy
during the holidays, no matter what.

35:22.912 --> 35:25.539
Most people are, but some aren't.

35:25.706 --> 35:29.876
While everybody else opens up presents,
they're opening up their wrists.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.212
Cheery thought.

35:32.380 --> 35:36.049
It's true. The suicide rate's
always the highest around the holidays.

35:37.552 --> 35:39.427
Now I'm depressed.

35:39.720 --> 35:41.805
Do you ever get depressed on Christmas?

35:43.182 --> 35:45.058
I don't celebrate Christmas.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.685
Are you Hindu or something?

35:46.894 --> 35:48.812
No, I just don't like to.

35:50.064 --> 35:52.732
What's not to like?
I mean, it's a lot of fun.

35:53.025 --> 35:54.067
God!

35:54.318 --> 35:56.820
Say you hate Thanksgiving,
and nobody cares.

35:57.029 --> 36:01.533
But say you hate Christmas, everybody
makes you feel like you're a leper.

36:04.036 --> 36:05.996
I'm sorry.
It's okay.

36:06.205 --> 36:10.500
I'm sorry. I'm just
a little tired and cranky.

36:10.751 --> 36:12.043
Yeah.

36:15.756 --> 36:17.424
Thanks for walking me home.

36:17.675 --> 36:19.676
No problem.

36:20.386 --> 36:21.553
- Good night.
- Good night.

36:22.555 --> 36:23.763
Kate?

36:26.601 --> 36:30.562
I was just wondering, do you
get any free nights off from Dorry's?

36:31.731 --> 36:33.190
Thursdays.

36:33.774 --> 36:35.692
Thursdays, yeah.

36:35.902 --> 36:38.486
Because I was just wondering...

36:38.696 --> 36:43.200
...if you're free this Thursday night,
maybe you'd like to go out on a date...

36:44.285 --> 36:45.327
...with me?

36:45.494 --> 36:46.620
I'd love to.

36:48.539 --> 36:49.748
Oh, yeah?

36:49.999 --> 36:51.583
Well, that's great!

36:53.044 --> 36:57.380
We can talk about it
on the phone and kind of...

36:57.632 --> 36:59.591
...square everything away.

37:01.677 --> 37:03.136
Good night, Billy.

37:11.312 --> 37:12.646
'Night.

37:30.498 --> 37:31.873
Hey there.

37:34.877 --> 37:37.545
Give me your arm, boy.
Come here, come on.

37:37.838 --> 37:40.674
Give me your arm.
No, this is not gonna hurt.

37:41.550 --> 37:43.385
This isn't gonna hurt.

37:43.678 --> 37:47.138
Not a big guy like you. Come on.

37:47.390 --> 37:51.268
There you go.
See, that's not so bad. Come on.

37:51.560 --> 37:54.396
Good, good.
Oh, that's good.

37:55.189 --> 37:58.525
Just a little blood test, pal.
You'll never miss it.

38:02.655 --> 38:05.031
They're like huge seedpods!

38:11.789 --> 38:14.082
- Having fun?
- Fun!

38:14.292 --> 38:15.542
Pretty neat, huh?

38:15.751 --> 38:16.918
Neat!

38:18.754 --> 38:20.463
Yum, yum! Yum, yum!

38:24.719 --> 38:27.220
How about shutting up
for a change, okay?

38:27.430 --> 38:29.055
I already fed you.

38:35.771 --> 38:38.231
Well, it's not 12:00 yet.

38:38.899 --> 38:42.944
All right. Keep an eye on them, Giz.
I'll be back in a second.

39:04.133 --> 39:05.592
Here we go.

39:05.801 --> 39:08.762
Now maybe you guys will be quiet.

39:19.648 --> 39:21.274
You guys are really hungry.

39:24.278 --> 39:25.945
Giz, you want some?

39:29.950 --> 39:31.368
Do you want some chicken?

39:32.495 --> 39:34.120
No?

39:34.455 --> 39:35.663
All right.

39:42.797 --> 39:44.297
Yum, yum.

39:54.975 --> 39:57.644
That's it, good buddy.
Call it a night.

40:36.517 --> 40:38.852
Can't you see?
They're after you!

40:39.019 --> 40:42.689
They're after all of us!
Our wives, our children, everyone!

40:42.857 --> 40:46.526
They're here already!
You're next!

40:47.069 --> 40:51.448
You're next!
You're next! You're next!

40:59.248 --> 41:01.082
Uh-oh.

41:02.710 --> 41:04.836
Mom?
Yeah?

41:05.045 --> 41:07.338
Mom, could you come up here, please?

41:13.053 --> 41:16.723
Then I want you to bring
the vacuum cleaner upstairs for me.

41:24.148 --> 41:25.148
What are they?

41:26.400 --> 41:29.068
Well, they're the mogwai, I guess.

41:29.278 --> 41:30.653
Except for Gizmo.

41:32.281 --> 41:34.240
Did you get them wet?

41:35.451 --> 41:36.618
No.

41:38.370 --> 41:40.371
Did you feed them
after midnight?

41:40.581 --> 41:42.624
Well, I gave them
some chicken.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.417
But I made sure that it...

41:46.253 --> 41:48.087
No, no, no. Wait a minute.

41:48.255 --> 41:50.089
I made sure...

41:56.972 --> 41:58.181
Mom?

41:58.432 --> 42:00.266
What's going on here?

42:02.102 --> 42:03.478
Yuck!

42:05.439 --> 42:07.524
What'd you say this was called?

42:07.775 --> 42:09.609
A putrid stage?

42:09.902 --> 42:12.529
Pupal. Pupal stage.

42:12.780 --> 42:14.322
Like a butterfly.

42:14.532 --> 42:15.573
Yeah, right.

42:15.741 --> 42:20.537
This is a cocoon, and inside
he's going through changes.

42:21.413 --> 42:22.997
Lots of changes.

42:23.290 --> 42:24.916
Like my mother.

42:26.460 --> 42:27.627
No, that's different.

42:27.836 --> 42:31.339
This is called a metamorphosis.

42:31.632 --> 42:33.716
It's a change in form...

42:33.968 --> 42:35.969
...and in appearance.

42:52.987 --> 42:54.153
Hello?

43:02.204 --> 43:04.747
Hello? Hi, honey!

43:05.165 --> 43:06.374
No, I'm sure it works fine.

43:06.584 --> 43:08.835
I was just out on the back porch
for a second.

43:09.378 --> 43:11.379
The convention's great.

43:14.675 --> 43:16.217
I said it's great!

43:16.468 --> 43:18.011
Actually, the competition's...

43:18.178 --> 43:19.220
Sorry, miss.

43:19.388 --> 43:22.265
The competition's a little more
advanced than I expected.

43:22.516 --> 43:26.394
I was changing my oil.
Some really neat things.

43:30.107 --> 43:31.733
Oh, Rand.

43:32.026 --> 43:35.695
You've never been so far
away on Christmas Eve before.

43:36.530 --> 43:38.698
I know it's Christmas Eve.

43:40.117 --> 43:41.701
I'll do the best I can.

43:42.244 --> 43:43.703
All right. Bye-bye.

43:45.789 --> 43:48.082
All I could get for it was $36!

43:48.292 --> 43:52.045
If there's anything I can do...
But it's completely out of my hands.

43:52.254 --> 43:53.796
I'll be delighted...

43:54.048 --> 43:57.050
Hello, Gerald.
I'm under such terrible pressure.

43:57.426 --> 44:00.053
Why don't you just
speak to Mrs. Deagle about it?

44:00.262 --> 44:02.555
Speak to Mrs. Deagle?

44:05.517 --> 44:06.559
Mrs. Deagle!

44:07.436 --> 44:09.145
Deposit this to my account.

44:17.279 --> 44:19.155
Where's that psychotic canine?

44:19.406 --> 44:21.324
Still hiding under the counter?

44:21.575 --> 44:24.077
No, I'm afraid he's on vacation.

44:24.244 --> 44:27.246
Better keep him behind locked doors,
because if I catch him...

44:27.456 --> 44:29.749
...he's in for a slow death.

44:37.174 --> 44:39.258
Here's Mr. Bird's heart.

44:41.345 --> 44:43.971
Small animals lose heat
faster than large ones.

44:44.181 --> 44:47.433
Their blood must circulate
faster to keep their bodies warm.

44:47.601 --> 44:48.851
Now, in small birds...

44:49.103 --> 44:51.938
...their hearts beat
about 600 times per minute.

44:52.147 --> 44:54.190
Cats, 130.

44:54.441 --> 44:55.983
Man, about 75...

44:56.276 --> 44:59.946
...and a big old elephant's heart,
only 25 a minute.

45:00.322 --> 45:03.282
Hey, doc, you
got a human heart?

45:03.450 --> 45:08.162
Has he got a human heart?
Wait till you see this! Roll 10.

46:14.354 --> 46:17.857
Okay, class.
Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.

46:18.150 --> 46:20.193
If any of you wanna bring me
a present...

46:20.360 --> 46:22.653
...a cassette deck wouldn't be bad.

46:22.863 --> 46:25.948
Of course, tickets to the Super Bowl
would be very nice.

46:27.034 --> 46:30.161
Mr. Hanson, wait.
Let me just talk to you for a second.

46:32.206 --> 46:33.247
Bye.

47:02.736 --> 47:03.778
Billy...

47:06.281 --> 47:07.824
It just hatched.

47:08.408 --> 47:09.784
I'll be right there.

47:30.931 --> 47:32.431
Hey there.

47:34.810 --> 47:37.979
You remember me?

47:45.279 --> 47:47.113
Remember me, don't you?

47:47.948 --> 47:49.615
I went and got you...

47:50.784 --> 47:52.493
...a candy bar.

47:52.786 --> 47:54.996
I thought you might be hungry.

47:56.248 --> 47:57.748
You hungry?

48:03.005 --> 48:05.339
You should try one of these.

48:20.647 --> 48:21.898
Hey there.

48:22.691 --> 48:26.360
Come here. Don't be afraid.
There's no reason to be afraid.

48:27.654 --> 48:28.988
Where'd you go?

48:30.324 --> 48:32.992
Where are you?
I know you're in there.

48:33.201 --> 48:35.036
I know you're under there.

48:36.580 --> 48:38.372
Come on, now.

48:38.832 --> 48:42.418
You're not still angry
about that little blood test, are you?

48:43.337 --> 48:45.880
Come on out.
Take a bite. Let me see you.

48:46.089 --> 48:48.716
I just wanna see you.

48:51.678 --> 48:54.847
You try some of this now.
I know you gotta be hungry.

48:56.391 --> 48:58.351
Yum, yum.

49:00.354 --> 49:03.064
There now. Don't you feel better?

49:26.046 --> 49:27.713
Mr. Hanson?

49:57.077 --> 49:59.787
Yum, yum.

51:43.266 --> 51:45.476
Gizmo ca-ca!

52:31.898 --> 52:33.816
Billy, are you okay?
Where are you?

52:34.234 --> 52:36.652
Mom, they hatched.
Get out of the house.

52:36.903 --> 52:39.238
Phone home. Ca-ca!

52:40.115 --> 52:42.408
Mom? Mom!

54:30.183 --> 54:32.226
Yum, yum.

55:09.180 --> 55:11.223
Get out of my kitchen!

57:06.089 --> 57:07.798
Neat!

57:27.694 --> 57:28.694
Hey!

57:34.284 --> 57:36.493
- Are you all right?
- I think so.

57:46.171 --> 57:47.754
Mom, it's Stripe!

57:59.225 --> 58:01.935
- Should I get it?
- Yeah, go ahead and get it.

58:02.353 --> 58:04.021
Oh, I didn't mean that.

58:05.023 --> 58:07.983
Hello, Dr. Molinaro. Can we come in?

58:08.193 --> 58:10.277
My mom's had a bit of an accident.

58:12.447 --> 58:14.239
Be careful!

58:14.657 --> 58:15.908
What happened?

58:25.543 --> 58:26.793
Giz?

58:40.975 --> 58:42.851
Bright light! Bright light!

58:43.102 --> 58:44.478
Come here.

58:45.063 --> 58:46.563
They almost got you, huh?

58:47.357 --> 58:48.857
Climb in here.

58:51.778 --> 58:54.905
The question is
totally without meaning.

58:56.199 --> 58:58.450
Pardon me, sir. Stuff.

58:59.994 --> 59:01.578
Thick and heavy.

59:01.829 --> 59:04.498
Would 60 gallons be sufficient?

59:05.124 --> 59:08.794
I rarely use it myself, sir.
It promotes rust.

59:19.305 --> 59:21.390
Don't worry, Giz, we'll find him.

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.946
Gremlins, huh?

01:01:41.197 --> 01:01:43.156
Little monsters.
- Right.

01:01:43.324 --> 01:01:47.577
- Hundreds of them?
- I'm not sure. Maybe thousands.

01:01:48.788 --> 01:01:51.790
Look, I know it sounds crazy.
I know it does.

01:01:51.999 --> 01:01:55.585
But in a matter of hours,
this town's gonna be a disaster area.

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:57.254
You've got to warn people!

01:01:57.463 --> 01:02:00.507
- You think this kid is drunk?
- No, but you are.

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:01.967
I am not drunk!

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:06.346
Tell me something. Where do
these little gremlins come from?

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:07.723
All right.

01:02:07.974 --> 01:02:11.351
My father gave me one as a present.

01:02:11.769 --> 01:02:15.105
Does your father always
give you vicious little monsters?

01:02:15.314 --> 01:02:18.108
No, they don't
start out vicious at first!

01:02:18.317 --> 01:02:19.568
Of course not.

01:02:19.777 --> 01:02:23.029
They don't!
They look like this.

01:02:24.282 --> 01:02:25.949
Could you dim the lights?

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:27.659
Sure.

01:02:28.286 --> 01:02:30.495
Go ahead, Brent.
Dim the lights.

01:02:40.506 --> 01:02:41.798
Gusto!

01:03:05.156 --> 01:03:06.823
Right, Murray?

01:03:16.167 --> 01:03:18.502
Sheila, will you quit messing
with the TV?

01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:21.421
You have the thingy.

01:03:25.843 --> 01:03:27.677
Goddamn foreign TV.

01:03:30.223 --> 01:03:32.015
We should've got a Zenith!

01:03:43.402 --> 01:03:44.653
Foreigners.

01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:51.034
I can't get a damn thing on this!

01:03:52.119 --> 01:03:53.119
Where are you going?

01:03:53.329 --> 01:03:56.540
I'm gonna check the antenna.
Maybe the damn thing blew down.

01:03:56.749 --> 01:03:58.458
Be careful, dear.

01:04:16.561 --> 01:04:18.353
What the hell is that?

01:05:04.775 --> 01:05:07.319
- It's them!
- You're crazy!

01:05:07.528 --> 01:05:10.280
There's a real gremlin in my cab!

01:05:42.146 --> 01:05:44.731
Hello, Anderson.
Wanna mail something, do you?

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.942
Just a last-minute package, Father.

01:05:47.151 --> 01:05:48.485
Be my guest.

01:05:50.488 --> 01:05:51.988
That's strange.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:23.144
Patriotic little fellow, ain't he?

01:06:23.354 --> 01:06:25.355
Waving the flag and everything.

01:06:27.316 --> 01:06:30.110
Be careful, Frank!
He might tear your arm off.

01:06:30.319 --> 01:06:32.487
You want me to put the cuffs on him?

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:35.240
Tell me. How come
a cute guy like this...

01:06:35.449 --> 01:06:37.951
...can turn into
a thousand ugly monsters?

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:41.246
You see, this is before
it enters the pupal stage.

01:06:41.455 --> 01:06:42.706
It multiplies with water.

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:47.002
Get the kid some water.
I wouldn't do that.

01:06:47.211 --> 01:06:48.712
Sheriff's office.

01:06:49.547 --> 01:06:50.797
Yeah, speaking.

01:06:53.050 --> 01:06:54.300
What?

01:06:56.679 --> 01:06:58.013
Oh, no.

01:06:58.723 --> 01:07:01.224
Yeah, sure, we'll be right over.

01:07:02.018 --> 01:07:03.309
What happened?

01:07:03.894 --> 01:07:05.145
The Futtermans.

01:07:05.688 --> 01:07:09.441
Something about a snowplow.
A freak accident.

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:10.984
It's the creatures!

01:07:11.193 --> 01:07:14.571
The creatures are making it
look like an accident!

01:07:16.115 --> 01:07:17.407
Will you listen to me?

01:07:17.658 --> 01:07:19.367
You listen to me, kid!

01:07:19.744 --> 01:07:21.745
Go on home, take little Gizmo...

01:07:21.954 --> 01:07:25.248
...sit by the fireplace
and open your Christmas presents.

01:07:25.458 --> 01:07:26.875
Attaboy.

01:07:27.668 --> 01:07:29.544
Let me drive.
No, you're drunk.

01:07:29.754 --> 01:07:30.837
You always drive!

01:07:31.047 --> 01:07:33.256
Because I'm the sheriff, asshole.

01:07:49.190 --> 01:07:52.734
Kopeck, you stop that, you bad kitty!

01:07:53.319 --> 01:07:55.487
Kopeck's a bad kitty.

01:07:55.738 --> 01:07:57.947
Ruble's a good little kitty.

01:07:58.199 --> 01:08:03.328
We'll find you something to eat.
She's a good kitty.

01:08:06.040 --> 01:08:08.583
Here we go. Here we go. Come on.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.335
All right, you stop that!

01:08:10.544 --> 01:08:12.128
Stop it!

01:08:15.674 --> 01:08:19.051
Mean kitty, you start eating
before everybody gets here.

01:08:19.261 --> 01:08:20.929
Come on, Dollar Bill.

01:08:21.138 --> 01:08:23.848
Yes, here we go, Dollar Bill.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:27.310
Mommy'll fix you
something good to eat.

01:08:27.520 --> 01:08:28.937
Everybody here?

01:08:29.188 --> 01:08:32.064
All right, let go of Mommy's coat.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.274
Here.

01:08:38.488 --> 01:08:40.490
Christmas carolers.

01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:43.868
I hate Christmas carolers.

01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:47.997
Screechy-voiced little glue-sniffers.

01:08:49.166 --> 01:08:51.751
I warned you brats!

01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:54.712
Ya-ya-ya! Ya-ya-ya!

01:09:06.892 --> 01:09:08.518
What are they?

01:09:08.727 --> 01:09:10.728
What are they?!

01:09:16.569 --> 01:09:17.986
They're here!

01:09:18.194 --> 01:09:21.363
They've come for me!
They've come!

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:25.618
I'm not ready.

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:28.830
I'm not ready yet.
I'm not ready!

01:09:54.398 --> 01:09:56.191
My God, Frye!

01:09:56.567 --> 01:09:57.984
That was Mrs. Deagle.

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:08.870
Get them off! Get them off! Help me!

01:10:10.164 --> 01:10:12.999
That's Dave Myers.
He does Santa every year.

01:10:18.130 --> 01:10:20.173
What the hell is he doing now?

01:10:21.008 --> 01:10:23.092
What's that stuff he's
got all over him?

01:10:25.679 --> 01:10:27.889
Frank, I really think
we should go now.

01:10:28.098 --> 01:10:31.267
Start the car. I'd really like
to go back to the station.

01:10:32.853 --> 01:10:34.103
Please!

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:38.733
Frank!

01:11:02.591 --> 01:11:04.133
Jesus, Frank!

01:11:04.343 --> 01:11:05.969
What the hell are those things?

01:11:08.013 --> 01:11:10.598
It's Christmas.
What the hell's going on?

01:11:10.808 --> 01:11:11.933
Shut up, will you?!

01:11:40.254 --> 01:11:41.921
I don't believe it.

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:48.261
You're on with Rockin' Ricky! Go!

01:11:48.470 --> 01:11:50.221
Hi, my name's Pete.

01:11:50.431 --> 01:11:53.474
These green guys are
running around wrecking things.

01:11:53.684 --> 01:11:56.102
This is Christmas, not Halloween!

01:11:56.353 --> 01:11:57.395
Listen, gang.

01:11:57.688 --> 01:12:00.898
Rockin' Ricky's getting fed up
with this Orson Welles crap!

01:12:01.108 --> 01:12:04.819
What's that? Kitty, what's that?
Some of Rockin' Ricky fans?

01:12:05.195 --> 01:12:07.613
You're not a Rockin' Ricky fan!

01:12:31.889 --> 01:12:35.391
Sir, I notice that you're a smoker.

01:12:36.143 --> 01:12:39.937
I notice that you're a smoker.
I see the cigarettes.

01:12:40.898 --> 01:12:43.483
I noticed, here, this broken ashtray.

01:12:44.485 --> 01:12:47.111
It's very fortunate
that I happened to come by.

01:12:47.279 --> 01:12:51.074
Let me introduce myself. My name's
Randall Peltzer. I'm an inventor.

01:12:51.283 --> 01:12:54.619
"Fantastic Ideas for a Fantastic World. "
I make the illogical logical.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:58.414
I have something here that I think
you might be interested in.

01:12:58.999 --> 01:13:00.625
Yes, sir, I do.

01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:02.460
This is...

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:05.296
...the Peltzer Smokeless Ashtray.

01:13:05.464 --> 01:13:08.466
I think this can solve
your problem here, sir.

01:14:01.019 --> 01:14:03.187
Please don't bite me!

01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:05.690
Wait a minute.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:32.730
You all right?

01:17:32.898 --> 01:17:34.398
Let's get out of here!

01:17:37.861 --> 01:17:39.070
What's that?

01:17:39.237 --> 01:17:42.156
Don't worry. He's with me.
He's not one of them.

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:50.706
What's wrong?
Why isn't the car starting?

01:17:51.541 --> 01:17:54.043
We're gonna have to
make a run for it, okay?

01:17:54.252 --> 01:17:56.587
One, two, three!

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:32.623
They've been here too.

01:18:33.458 --> 01:18:36.335
What are these things?
Where do they come from?

01:18:37.796 --> 01:18:39.714
They're gremlins, Kate.

01:18:40.966 --> 01:18:43.259
Just like Mr. Futterman said.

01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:52.435
Now I have another reason
to hate Christmas.

01:18:53.311 --> 01:18:54.812
What are you talking about?

01:18:55.772 --> 01:19:00.317
The worst thing that ever
happened to me was on Christmas.

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:03.320
Oh, God. It was so horrible.

01:19:06.825 --> 01:19:08.659
It was Christmas Eve.

01:19:09.327 --> 01:19:10.995
I was 9 years old.

01:19:12.497 --> 01:19:15.291
Me and Mom were decorating the tree...

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:18.043
...waiting for Dad
to come home from work.

01:19:19.838 --> 01:19:21.630
A couple hours went by.

01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:23.507
Dad wasn't home.

01:19:23.884 --> 01:19:26.510
So Mom called the office.
No answer.

01:19:27.971 --> 01:19:32.683
Christmas Day came and went,
and still nothing.

01:19:34.394 --> 01:19:36.645
So the police began a search.

01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:39.398
Four or five days went by.

01:19:39.691 --> 01:19:42.485
Neither one of us
could eat or sleep.

01:19:43.361 --> 01:19:45.321
Everything was falling apart.

01:19:47.032 --> 01:19:48.699
It was snowing outside.

01:19:49.659 --> 01:19:54.038
The house was freezing, so I went
to try to light up the fire.

01:19:54.206 --> 01:19:56.415
That's when I noticed the smell.

01:20:00.837 --> 01:20:03.714
The firemen came and
broke through the chimney top.

01:20:03.882 --> 01:20:08.052
And me and Mom were expecting
them to pull out a dead cat or a bird.

01:20:08.303 --> 01:20:11.055
And instead they pulled out my father.

01:20:15.393 --> 01:20:18.729
He was dressed
in a Santa Claus suit.

01:20:19.606 --> 01:20:22.107
He'd been climbing down the chimney...

01:20:22.359 --> 01:20:24.610
...his arms loaded with presents.

01:20:25.237 --> 01:20:27.071
He was gonna surprise us.

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:33.369
He slipped and broke his neck.
He died instantly.

01:20:37.582 --> 01:20:40.417
And that's how I found out
there was no Santa Claus.

01:20:44.214 --> 01:20:47.758
Don't worry about that smoke.
It'll stop. It's guaranteed.

01:20:58.228 --> 01:20:59.728
Barney, shut up!

01:20:59.938 --> 01:21:02.356
Don't start with me.
I got a long way to go.

01:21:03.066 --> 01:21:04.149
Shut up!

01:21:59.998 --> 01:22:01.332
Where did they all go?

01:22:01.541 --> 01:22:03.334
It'll be light soon.

01:22:03.501 --> 01:22:05.711
I bet they're all
together someplace dark.

01:22:14.304 --> 01:22:15.721
Mogwai!

01:22:25.941 --> 01:22:28.192
Shh, Gizmo.

01:22:45.877 --> 01:22:47.336
They're inside.

01:22:47.545 --> 01:22:48.963
All of them?

01:22:55.220 --> 01:22:56.679
Milk Duds.

01:24:18.261 --> 01:24:19.678
What are they doing?

01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:23.140
They're watching Snow White.

01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.768
And they love it.

01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:35.069
Where's the boiler room?

01:24:35.278 --> 01:24:36.987
It's in the back of the theater.

01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:52.169
Down there.

01:25:02.180 --> 01:25:03.180
Milk Duds.

01:25:26.746 --> 01:25:29.164
Yum, yum.

01:25:39.884 --> 01:25:42.386
Cover your mouth.
Don't breathe any gas.

01:25:57.402 --> 01:25:58.485
Billy!

01:25:58.653 --> 01:25:59.903
Go.

01:26:23.261 --> 01:26:24.428
Billy!

01:26:42.405 --> 01:26:43.572
Billy!

01:26:45.116 --> 01:26:48.952
- Hurry up!
- Move, Katie! Watch out!

01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:52.915
Come on!

01:27:31.996 --> 01:27:32.996
Billy...

01:27:33.373 --> 01:27:35.457
In the department store.

01:27:36.459 --> 01:27:37.793
Stripe!

01:28:06.823 --> 01:28:09.491
That's Stripe.
He's the leader.

01:28:12.036 --> 01:28:14.871
If he gets to water,
it'll start all over again.

01:28:31.806 --> 01:28:36.560
Take Giz, go back and try
and find some kind of light switch.

01:28:48.239 --> 01:28:50.073
Careful, Billy.

01:30:00.937 --> 01:30:03.188
Ward is your snowplow headquarters.

01:30:27.672 --> 01:30:29.423
Attention, Christmas shoppers.

01:30:29.632 --> 01:30:34.469
Saturday morning at 8:30, we'll have
Santa Claus for all the kiddies.

01:30:49.318 --> 01:30:51.653
We have the Kingston Falls...

01:30:53.072 --> 01:30:54.698
Attention, shoppers.

01:32:17.573 --> 01:32:19.241
Light bright!

01:32:26.666 --> 01:32:28.833
Bye-bye.

01:33:26.976 --> 01:33:28.893
It takes a certain kind of guy.

01:33:29.103 --> 01:33:31.938
And that guy needs
a certain kind of dame.

01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:29.579
Water!

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:33.583
Gun!

01:34:34.168 --> 01:34:36.961
It's been a rough night
for Rockin' Ricky...

01:34:37.672 --> 01:34:40.548
...but he's still on the air!

01:34:40.925 --> 01:34:43.885
The Marines are standing by
with fire hoses.

01:35:30.599 --> 01:35:32.392
Billy.

01:36:26.947 --> 01:36:29.449
Gizmo ca-ca!

01:36:29.658 --> 01:36:31.701
Light bright! Light bright!

01:37:10.699 --> 01:37:13.034
What the hell is that?

01:37:25.089 --> 01:37:26.089
Your scarf.

01:38:29.361 --> 01:38:30.820
We switch to a report...

01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:34.073
...from the scene of
the Christmas Eve riots.

01:38:35.618 --> 01:38:39.579
This is Lew Landers,
WDHB's Action Central News...

01:38:39.788 --> 01:38:41.831
...at the site of Dorry's Tavern...

01:38:42.207 --> 01:38:45.627
...or what used to be Dorry's Tavern,
in Kingston Falls...

01:38:45.836 --> 01:38:47.253
...where officials blame...

01:38:47.463 --> 01:38:51.341
...mass hysteria for the escalating
series of unexplained...

01:38:51.550 --> 01:38:55.929
...accidents, fires and explosions
that rocked this once-peaceful town...

01:38:56.472 --> 01:38:57.931
...on Christmas Eve.

01:38:58.140 --> 01:39:01.225
The bizarre demise
of Mrs. Ruby Deagle, widow...

01:39:01.435 --> 01:39:04.771
...of convicted stock-swindler
Donald Deagle...

01:39:05.230 --> 01:39:07.148
Don't chew that.

01:39:07.399 --> 01:39:08.691
Don't chew.

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:13.571
I bet he'd like
some chicken soup.

01:39:19.203 --> 01:39:23.498
Honey, this is the gentleman
who sold me the mogwai.

01:39:23.999 --> 01:39:27.877
"Sold. " An interesting choice of words.

01:39:32.257 --> 01:39:35.677
Conflicting eyewitness reports
concerning "little green men"...

01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:42.266
You teach him to watch television?

01:39:48.190 --> 01:39:50.817
There was, I believe, a box.

01:40:00.411 --> 01:40:01.577
Dad...

01:40:12.047 --> 01:40:13.756
Rand, your scarf.

01:40:15.801 --> 01:40:16.968
I warned you.

01:40:17.594 --> 01:40:20.888
With mogwai comes much responsibility.

01:40:21.140 --> 01:40:22.557
But you didn't listen.

01:40:22.808 --> 01:40:25.143
And you see what happens.

01:40:25.352 --> 01:40:27.186
I didn't mean it.

01:40:27.396 --> 01:40:30.815
You do with mogwai what your society...

01:40:31.066 --> 01:40:35.194
...has done with all of nature's gifts.

01:40:35.404 --> 01:40:37.530
You do not understand.

01:40:39.992 --> 01:40:41.367
You are not ready.

01:40:52.171 --> 01:40:53.713
Papa?
Yes?

01:40:57.301 --> 01:40:59.510
He has something to say to you.

01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:08.853
You understand what
he says when he speaks to you?

01:41:09.063 --> 01:41:12.356
To hear, one has only to listen.

01:41:16.195 --> 01:41:17.779
Bye, Billy.

01:41:23.786 --> 01:41:26.829
Perhaps someday you may be ready.

01:41:27.039 --> 01:41:28.956
Until then, mogwai...

01:41:29.374 --> 01:41:30.917
...will be waiting.

01:41:34.129 --> 01:41:35.505
Excuse me, sir.

01:41:36.381 --> 01:41:38.466
Before you go, I wanted to tell you...

01:41:38.717 --> 01:41:41.511
...that I am truly sorry
for what's happened.

01:41:42.012 --> 01:41:44.931
And if you would accept it,
I'd like to...

01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:47.141
...give you this small token.

01:41:47.434 --> 01:41:50.728
There's one other one.
This is an invention of mine.

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:52.980
Smokeless Ashtray.

01:41:53.190 --> 01:41:54.232
How did you know?

01:41:54.441 --> 01:41:57.360
Man at gas station tried to sell me.

01:41:57.611 --> 01:42:00.321
Latest word in technology.

01:42:00.906 --> 01:42:03.074
Very generous of you.

01:42:03.283 --> 01:42:06.160
I'm sure it will come in handy.
