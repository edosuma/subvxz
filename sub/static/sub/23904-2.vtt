WEBVTT

00:00.668 --> 00:01.435
We've been sent a leg.

00:01.502 --> 00:04.638
- A human leg.

00:04.705 --> 00:06.974
Whose leg did you think it was?

00:07.041 --> 00:10.378
It might be a girl
called Brittany Brockbank.

00:10.444 --> 00:12.113
Do you still think
it's one of those three men?

00:12.180 --> 00:14.182
Whittaker got away
with murder twice.

00:14.248 --> 00:16.684
Laing charmed everyone while
he kept his wife terrified.

00:16.750 --> 00:18.619
Brockbank was a child rapist
who managed

00:18.686 --> 00:21.622
to convince everyone that
he was the injured party.

00:21.689 --> 00:24.558
Careful exiting the hotel.
We were followed last night.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.763
- Robs, please, I haven't even..

00:29.830 --> 00:31.599
We just found
the young woman's body

00:31.665 --> 00:33.567
in a building
in Whitechapel High Street.

00:33.634 --> 00:36.137
'We found it was you
that invited her there.'

00:36.204 --> 00:39.607
You've never met her?
Kelsey Platt.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.345
* You and me *

00:46.013 --> 00:48.849
* Me and you *

00:48.916 --> 00:53.821
* Somehow we make it through *

00:55.189 --> 00:57.891
* I may be gone *

00:57.958 --> 01:00.194
* I may be far away *

01:01.662 --> 01:05.099
* But I'll walk beside you *

01:05.166 --> 01:09.103
* Every step of the way *

01:09.170 --> 01:13.941
* When you're used bruised *

01:14.007 --> 01:16.210
* Black and blue *

01:16.277 --> 01:19.313
* Don't think about it *

01:20.781 --> 01:23.317
* Never doubt it *

01:23.384 --> 01:26.820
* I'll walk beside you **

01:48.108 --> 01:50.178
'Let's start
with the photograph.'

01:50.244 --> 01:52.213
Sent to the papers
by a concerned friend.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.381
Is that right?

01:53.447 --> 01:55.216
Pedophile and murder suspect.

01:55.283 --> 01:57.451
It's not a popular spot
on the Venn diagram.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.153
Do you think
the photo's doctored?

01:59.220 --> 02:02.323
No.
Excuse me, is this seat taken?

02:02.390 --> 02:04.124
- No.
- Thanks.

02:04.192 --> 02:05.659
Simple as that.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.161
If you're trying
to make me look dodgy

02:07.228 --> 02:08.896
at some point,
I'll look up at the same moment

02:08.962 --> 02:10.198
you're looking at me.

02:10.264 --> 02:11.765
'The photo taken
in that split second'

02:11.832 --> 02:13.667
will make it look like
we're havin' a conversation.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.337
You find the person
who took that photograph

02:16.404 --> 02:17.638
you'll have Kelsey's killer.

02:17.705 --> 02:19.106
And it's probably
someone she trusted.

02:19.173 --> 02:20.674
What else?

02:20.741 --> 02:23.277
That girl's wearing a vest top,
so it was warm weather.

02:23.344 --> 02:24.845
Probably taken at least
five months ago.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.580
And she's reading a magazine.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.416
If the papers were sent
a hi-res image

02:28.482 --> 02:31.084
that will help you date it.
Anything else?

02:31.151 --> 02:33.387
Kelsey's holding
a bottle of water.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.456
Who goes to a coffee shop
to sit and drink water?

02:35.523 --> 02:37.391
I'd skew toward saying
she came specifically

02:37.458 --> 02:39.193
to sit next to me
rather than to enjoy

02:39.260 --> 02:41.462
a freshly prepared
caffeinated beverage.

02:42.730 --> 02:43.997
You seem annoyed.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.933
Have you found the three men
I told Wardle about?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.301
I can't discuss that with you.

02:47.368 --> 02:49.136
Because it's now a part
of a murder investigation.

02:49.203 --> 02:50.571
Exactly.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.806
I don't care, I'll pay the fine.

02:52.873 --> 02:54.375
I have asthma.

02:57.645 --> 02:58.746
Sorry.

03:28.342 --> 03:31.345
Do we have a printout of Donald
Laing's fundraising page?

03:31.412 --> 03:32.946
'Uh, yeah, somewhere.
Where are you?'

03:33.013 --> 03:35.316
I just had a social
down at the station.

03:35.383 --> 03:38.118
'
- Yes, me.

03:38.185 --> 03:40.187
So we'd better get a move on.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.823
Just coming up now.

03:42.890 --> 03:45.959
'This is the Strata building,
Elephant and Castle.'

03:46.026 --> 03:48.095
We can use this to work out
what block he lived in.

03:48.161 --> 03:49.630
There's no guarantee
he's still there.

03:49.697 --> 03:51.265
Great.

03:51.332 --> 03:53.233
I called Brockbank last night.

03:55.369 --> 03:57.271
He suggested meeting
in Shoreditch

03:57.338 --> 03:58.872
but then he hung up on me.

03:58.939 --> 04:01.475
Well, you know, he has a history
of bouncing around strip clubs.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.777
I thought that'd be
a good place to start.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.879
I think he's living
with a little girl.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.050
Okay.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.552
'Head down
to Elephant and Castle.'

04:11.619 --> 04:13.621
'If you see Laing,
keep your distance.'

04:13.687 --> 04:15.956
No walking after dark,
keep on the busy routes.

04:16.023 --> 04:17.858
Yes, I have done
counter-surveillance.

04:17.925 --> 04:21.329
If it was up to me, you'd stay
in Yorkshire till he's caught.

04:21.395 --> 04:23.397
He addressed the leg to you.
He followed you.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.132
That's the pattern
we have so far.

04:25.198 --> 04:27.368
I know, and I will be careful.

04:27.435 --> 04:30.103
'Right.
So, you're checking out Laing.'

04:30.170 --> 04:31.839
I'll look for Brockbank.

04:57.398 --> 04:58.899
'Do you know this guy?'

04:58.966 --> 05:01.068
No, I don't think so, mate.
Sorry.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.604
Have you been here before,
darling?

05:36.670 --> 05:37.705
No.

05:37.771 --> 05:40.674
- Yeah, I think so.

05:46.814 --> 05:50.484
You wanna dance,
private dance with me?

05:50.551 --> 05:52.386
I'm looking for a friend.

05:52.453 --> 05:54.688
I'll be your friend.

05:58.258 --> 06:01.529
Not that kind of friend, sadly.

06:08.936 --> 06:12.239
Perhaps you know my friend.
Noel Brockbank.

06:12.305 --> 06:15.175
- He owes me some money.
- Des fired him.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.410
You're no use as a bouncer

06:16.477 --> 06:18.479
if you have a fit
and piss yourself.

06:18.546 --> 06:20.548
Would anyone here
have his address?

06:20.614 --> 06:22.416
I think he lives with Alyssa.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.618
'She's got
the worst taste in men.'

06:30.190 --> 06:32.793
- Mm-hmm.

06:32.860 --> 06:34.795
Des fired her as well.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.930
There's some council flat
over in Bow.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.131
She bitches about it

06:38.198 --> 06:41.334
but she likes the nursery
her kids are in, so..

06:43.403 --> 06:45.172
Could you introduce me to Des?

06:45.238 --> 06:48.976
Thanks for the drink, darling,
but I reckon you're trouble.

06:49.042 --> 06:50.778
Normally, I like trouble.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.625
What is it

07:04.692 --> 07:06.359
'Uh, nothing, I'm fine.'

07:06.426 --> 07:08.228
I found Laing's block.

07:08.295 --> 07:10.063
It could be one
of a hundred flats, but..

07:10.130 --> 07:13.100
Well, make sure you're home
before sunset.

07:13.166 --> 07:15.969
'
- Expensive.

07:17.571 --> 07:19.139
'Look, put yourself
in a cab now. I can't--'

07:19.206 --> 07:20.908
Cormoran, you have
to stop treating me

07:20.974 --> 07:22.710
like I'm part of the problem.

07:22.776 --> 07:24.745
'I'm having dinner with my mum
tonight around the corner'

07:24.812 --> 07:27.815
'from work,
so I will be perfectly safe.'

07:27.881 --> 07:29.449
Right.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.284
Matt shouldn't have called you.

07:31.351 --> 07:32.820
I'm glad he did.

07:32.886 --> 07:36.089
Well, I'm not stopping doing
this job. Not for anyone.

07:36.156 --> 07:38.091
Whatever you do, you'll always
have mine and your dad's

07:38.158 --> 07:40.260
full support, but, Robin,
I do think it's time

07:40.327 --> 07:43.497
to make a decision.
The wedding day's nearly here.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.480
You seen this guy?
Donald Laing?

08:00.548 --> 08:01.915
No.

08:03.216 --> 08:04.652
Thank you.

08:09.623 --> 08:10.791
- Hello.
- Hello.

08:10.858 --> 08:13.894
- No.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.463
Would you like to come back
to Masham for a bit?

08:16.530 --> 08:19.166
- Be a bit looked after.
- No.

08:19.232 --> 08:20.901
Sorry.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.637
I didn't, I didn't mean it
like that. I just, um..

08:27.675 --> 08:29.677
I worry I'd f..

08:30.978 --> 08:34.214
I, I worry I'd feel
like I did before.

08:34.281 --> 08:38.018
Like I was...shutting
out the world, and..

08:40.120 --> 08:42.122
...I want to stay in it.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.807
Is that the famous
Cormoran Strike?

08:59.873 --> 09:02.776
- Donny Laing.

09:05.312 --> 09:07.915
Not on license or anything?

09:07.981 --> 09:09.983
I'm a private investigator now.

09:10.050 --> 09:11.585
Oh, dear.

09:11.652 --> 09:15.022
Well, what are you
here for then?

09:15.088 --> 09:17.925
I recently spoke
to a woman in Corby.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.895
- That's right.

09:21.962 --> 09:25.032
I never hurt her,
you understand?

09:25.098 --> 09:27.234
Lesson learned
first fuckin' time.

09:27.300 --> 09:29.670
Did you steal her jewelry?

09:29.737 --> 09:31.872
You've come to find..

09:31.939 --> 09:33.373
That was years ago.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.143
Well, it had sentimental value.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.978
Well, tell her I'm sorry

09:38.045 --> 09:40.047
but her stuff's long gone.

09:40.113 --> 09:43.350
It's the truth.
I don't feel good about it.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.587
I'll pass that back to her.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.559
What, is that it from you?

09:52.626 --> 09:54.261
Yeah.

09:54.327 --> 09:58.365
Fine private investigator
you turned out.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.934
Trackin' down old bits of tar.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.997
That's 500 pounds.

10:30.063 --> 10:33.433
It can be the deposit
on renting a flat of your own

10:33.500 --> 10:37.838
or it can be a pair of really
beautiful wedding shoes.

11:16.243 --> 11:17.945
Cormoran?

11:52.145 --> 11:53.313
Thanks.

11:53.380 --> 11:56.483
I, uh, came back
for some files and you were..

11:59.319 --> 12:03.490
Look, I've, um,
been given some money.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.558
'Oh, it's only 500 quid'

12:05.625 --> 12:07.160
but if we don't pay the bills

12:07.227 --> 12:08.996
we won't be able
to work here anymore.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.630
Someone's trying to destroy me.

12:10.697 --> 12:13.967
I think I make a fairly
poor prospect for investment.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.302
Under the circumstances

12:15.368 --> 12:17.004
you're better off
putting it on a horse.

12:17.070 --> 12:19.206
Uh, I'm better off here.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.810
Let me do this for us.

12:27.480 --> 12:30.017
- Shit!

12:30.083 --> 12:32.385
- Slept through a date.
- Oh.

12:33.921 --> 12:37.724
- Swedish, pretty.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.427
Doesn't give a fuck.

12:40.493 --> 12:41.895
Sounds perfect.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.401
I should go to bed.

12:52.439 --> 12:54.607
'Thanks for Donald Laing,
by the way.'

12:54.674 --> 12:56.109
'But it's a dead end.'

12:56.176 --> 12:58.812
'Guy's even more crippled
than I am.'

13:00.513 --> 13:03.817
I really don't like
you being out after dark.

13:03.884 --> 13:06.286
- Take a cab.
- Sure.

13:11.524 --> 13:12.960
'Night.'

13:14.161 --> 13:15.295
Night.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.283
'What's all this?'

13:36.349 --> 13:39.086
Uh, I made that Nigel Slater
salmon thing you like.

13:41.855 --> 13:43.223
Thanks.

13:44.524 --> 13:46.226
I ate with mum.

13:50.730 --> 13:53.300
- She's fine.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.202
'Good.'

13:55.268 --> 13:58.005
'Look, I've got something
I need to say to you.'

14:17.157 --> 14:19.359
What I did was unforgivable.

14:21.461 --> 14:23.463
I was 21.

14:23.530 --> 14:26.099
I was in so much pain.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.501
I was incredibly lonely,
and I made a mistake.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.606
You are the love of my life..

14:36.343 --> 14:38.111
...and I want to marry you.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.313
More than anything,
that's what I want.

14:41.848 --> 14:45.185
But that's for you
to decide, so..

14:50.623 --> 14:53.126
...I'm askin' you again.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.962
And if you say no,
I'll accept it

14:55.028 --> 14:57.264
and I'll leave the flat
in the mornin'.

15:21.989 --> 15:23.890
I love him, darling.

15:23.957 --> 15:26.926
One day, you'll feel like that
about somebody.

17:06.493 --> 17:08.895
Went for the knife, very good.

17:08.961 --> 17:10.497
'I'm just checking the locks.'

17:10.563 --> 17:13.200
And see, your door
at the back, there is, um..

17:15.635 --> 17:17.204
Well, it's not adequate.

17:17.270 --> 17:20.006
'I need to get back
to Masham for a few days'

17:20.073 --> 17:22.742
for dress fittings and stuff.

17:22.809 --> 17:25.612
I know it's not great timing,
but is that okay?

17:25.678 --> 17:27.647
No, it's..

17:27.714 --> 17:30.150
It's good.
Keep you out of harm's way.

17:31.484 --> 17:33.019
Good.

17:33.086 --> 17:34.721
Well, just stick
a padlock on that.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.122
Where's mum?

18:43.323 --> 18:46.125
You've never met her?

18:46.193 --> 18:47.694
Kelsey Platt.

19:10.850 --> 19:12.185
Look..

19:13.553 --> 19:15.388
Oh, my God, it's you.

19:15.455 --> 19:18.425
I need to ask you
about your sister.

19:18.491 --> 19:20.960
- Please.
'

19:21.027 --> 19:24.964
It's, uh, it's Cormoran Strike.

19:25.031 --> 19:27.434
Why is he here? Close the door.

19:27.500 --> 19:30.437
Um, wait.
Yeah, can

19:30.503 --> 19:32.605
Yeah.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.074
'You saw those photos
of him and Kelsey.'

19:35.141 --> 19:37.744
Look, I know what you're saying,
but the, the police say

19:37.810 --> 19:39.178
they think he got set up.

19:39.246 --> 19:40.813
How is he even allowed
to come here?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.950
I know, but...
but Kelsey looked up to him.

19:44.016 --> 19:45.685
Yeah, and look where she is now.

19:47.019 --> 19:49.055
'Look, sorry,
I know she was your sister'

19:49.121 --> 19:50.823
'but I cared about her too.'

19:50.890 --> 19:53.293
'Talk to him if you want.
I won't.'

19:55.995 --> 19:58.898
- I think you could come in.
- Thank you.

20:01.568 --> 20:03.436
Alright. Do you wanna sit down?

20:04.804 --> 20:06.539
Could I, uh..

20:06.606 --> 20:07.907
Yeah.

20:15.047 --> 20:16.983
I'm very sorry for your loss.

20:19.185 --> 20:21.988
I suppose the police have
asked you a lot of questions.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.257
Yeah, was I workin'.

20:24.324 --> 20:26.759
Had solid statements
from colleagues, pay slips..

20:28.795 --> 20:31.531
Uh, right up
to printin' off photos

20:31.598 --> 20:33.232
of him and Ritchie fishin'.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.635
Boat wasn't still up.

20:35.702 --> 20:38.571
'They were away
that week in Wales.'

20:38.638 --> 20:41.140
And now, we're the ones
who've lost her.

20:44.277 --> 20:46.613
- Do you mind if I..
- No.

20:55.021 --> 20:57.857
Do you have any idea who might
have got close to Kelsey?

20:57.924 --> 21:00.693
No, uh,
she didn't have many friends.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.864
'She came and lived with us
after our mum died.'

21:04.931 --> 21:08.335
But there was always
the age gap, so..

21:11.203 --> 21:12.639
I don't know.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.483
- Uh, it's upstairs.

23:05.184 --> 23:06.853
You didn't do it, did you?

23:09.155 --> 23:11.758
No. I didn't.

23:23.269 --> 23:24.837
You alright?

23:26.473 --> 23:28.475
Mm.

23:28.541 --> 23:30.810
You should redecorate in here.

23:30.877 --> 23:33.546
It will always be
your room, love.

23:54.266 --> 23:56.202
You stupid bastard.

23:58.671 --> 24:01.173
'Ray said it felt like
you were attackin' Hazel.'

24:01.240 --> 24:03.876
Can you imagine if he'd gone
to the papers instead of us?

24:03.943 --> 24:06.445
Murder suspect shows up
at grieving relatives' house

24:06.513 --> 24:08.548
and demands
to check their alibis.

24:08.615 --> 24:10.182
- That is not what I was--
- You went there.

24:10.249 --> 24:11.383
It's unbelievable.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.652
So what do you think
I should do?

24:12.719 --> 24:15.287
Well, stay out of it,
work your own cases.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.423
Nobody wants to hire
a detective who's accused

24:17.490 --> 24:19.058
of being a pedophile
and a murderer.

24:19.125 --> 24:21.561
Can't afford the rent
on this place next month.

24:21.628 --> 24:23.530
I'll have to make
my partner redundant

24:23.596 --> 24:24.931
while she's on her honeymoon.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.699
So what exactly
do you suggest I do

24:26.766 --> 24:28.968
while someone's cutting up
little girls on my account?

24:29.035 --> 24:31.203
We need you to trust us
to do our job.

24:31.270 --> 24:33.806
The three names I gave you,
who've you found?

24:33.873 --> 24:35.842
We're still makin' enquiries.

24:35.908 --> 24:37.443
'Right, Whittaker's in Catford.'

24:37.510 --> 24:39.712
'Laing was in Corby but is
now in Elephant and Castle.'

24:39.779 --> 24:42.281
And Brockbank just got fired
from a strip club in Shoreditch.

24:42.348 --> 24:44.183
And-and your suggestion
is that I just sit back

24:44.250 --> 24:47.319
and wait for London's finest to
plod along to the finish line?

24:47.386 --> 24:49.488
By the time you figure things
out, I'll be on the street

24:49.556 --> 24:50.657
and Robin will be dead.

24:50.723 --> 24:52.892
We're on your side, you idiot.

24:54.861 --> 24:57.196
I'm sorry.
I don't know what else to do.

25:10.677 --> 25:12.111
Oh, uh, it's Zaharah's mum.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.113
Look, I haven't been gettin'
any letters from you lot.

25:14.180 --> 25:15.615
'I was thinking maybe
you got my address wrong.'

25:16.916 --> 25:18.350
Shh.

25:18.417 --> 25:19.919
Piss off.

25:19.986 --> 25:22.254
It's Alyssa, Zaharah's mum.

25:24.356 --> 25:25.625
No?

25:25.692 --> 25:26.826
Oh, it's alright, it's alright.

25:26.893 --> 25:29.629
No worries, thanks. Thanks.

25:29.696 --> 25:32.799
- That was horrific.
- It's work.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.808
Hiya, it's Alyssa,
Zaharah's mum.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.576
Look, I've not been gettin'
letters for a while.

25:43.643 --> 25:44.711
I was just checking
that you're not

25:44.777 --> 25:46.613
still using the old address.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.992
Ah! Yeah, no,
that's fine, that's..

26:00.059 --> 26:02.261
That's the right one, yeah.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.296
Which number are you usin'?

26:37.163 --> 26:40.733
Plate for the meat,
come on, come on. Ow!

26:45.772 --> 26:48.741
Ooh. You make a gravy, love.

27:53.940 --> 27:55.607
Darling, Matthew's on the phone.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.243
'Is he alright?'

27:58.711 --> 28:00.346
Matt, are you okay?

28:04.150 --> 28:05.484
A what?

28:19.065 --> 28:21.567
A friend of Matthew's.
Here to check if he's alright.

28:21.633 --> 28:23.235
Okay. Incoming.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.955
'Robin asked me
to check in on you.'

28:43.022 --> 28:45.291
I'm fine, thanks.

28:45.357 --> 28:46.759
'The police have got
everything covered.'

28:46.826 --> 28:47.994
Well, she's driving down now.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.195
You know that, obviously.

28:49.261 --> 28:52.031
What would it take
for you to let her go?

28:52.098 --> 28:53.532
- She's been followed.

28:53.599 --> 28:55.667
She's had body parts
sent to her.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.369
She's had her flat broken into

28:57.436 --> 29:00.706
by someone who butchers women.

29:00.773 --> 29:04.010
I mean, you're just gonna, like,
see what happens to her next?

29:04.076 --> 29:05.912
I understand you're having
a difficult morning.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.279
Robin's good at what she does.

29:07.346 --> 29:09.515
She's very good.
She manages the risks.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.083
If she ever decides
to hand in her notice

29:11.150 --> 29:12.284
that'll be her decision

29:12.351 --> 29:14.520
but I would try
to persuade her to stay.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.489
The police will watch
your flat at night.

29:17.556 --> 29:19.158
I don't think he'll try
anything here again.

29:19.225 --> 29:20.993
You mean,
you don't know anything.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.195
Really, though. Do you?

29:24.496 --> 29:26.432
It's proving challenging.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.896
Hiya.

30:05.304 --> 30:07.974
- Oh, he's fine.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.242
- He went to work in the end.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.213
I spent about an hour
checkin' the flat over

30:14.280 --> 30:15.882
and bleaching everything.

30:15.948 --> 30:18.217
- You know, the police--
- Yeah, I know. I just..

30:20.386 --> 30:23.189
I got an exact address
for Brockbank.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.024
I called around
all the nurseries in Bow

30:25.091 --> 30:26.825
pretending to be Alyssa
until one of them

30:26.893 --> 30:29.595
finally confirmed they have
my address details right.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.030
Very clever.

30:32.064 --> 30:33.933
Let's just find this guy.

30:34.000 --> 30:36.435
I can't go back to Whittaker.
He saw me.

30:36.502 --> 30:40.006
But the person
we're looking for is careful.

30:40.072 --> 30:43.475
Deliberate.
Doesn't feel like Whittaker.

30:43.542 --> 30:45.177
But I don't know.

30:45.244 --> 30:47.346
I'll watch Whittaker.

30:47.413 --> 30:50.016
It's a long--
- I'll watch Whittaker.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.486
- Yeah.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.960
- Ta.
- 'Thank you.'

31:12.404 --> 31:13.539
Gosh.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.242
Are you alright?

31:25.417 --> 31:27.486
Oh, you look like you're having
one of those days.

31:27.553 --> 31:30.122
I just thought.. Uh, order
what you want. I'll pay.

31:43.235 --> 31:44.603
'Cheers.'

31:50.909 --> 31:53.012
- Hmm.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.546
Did your boyfriend do this?

31:56.415 --> 31:58.617
- 'He's goin' away.'

31:58.684 --> 32:01.988
I didn't want him to go.
That's why he's done it.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.356
I, I think
he's got someone else.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.125
H-he says he's only going
with the band.

32:06.192 --> 32:08.227
But I don't believe him.

32:08.294 --> 32:09.528
What sort of music does he play?

32:09.595 --> 32:12.965
Metal.
The band's called Death Cult.

32:13.032 --> 32:15.467
He's lead guitar.

32:15.534 --> 32:19.371
- Yeah. They're good.

32:19.438 --> 32:21.140
'What's this?'

32:24.276 --> 32:25.711
What's your name?

32:27.379 --> 32:28.947
- You made a little friend.
- No.

32:29.015 --> 32:31.217
Uh, actually,
I was just leaving.

32:31.283 --> 32:34.153
Oh, really?
Seems like such a shame.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.522
- Nice to meet you, Stephanie.
- Fuck off.

32:38.424 --> 32:40.392
Obviously, you're not such
good friends after all.

32:40.459 --> 32:42.528
And you've obviously
tried very hard.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.737
Just being kind, were you?

32:51.803 --> 32:55.374
I was just concerned.
She looked a bit beaten up.

32:55.441 --> 32:57.176
Oh, I wouldn't worry
too much about her.

32:57.243 --> 33:00.746
She can be a clumsy
little bitch at times.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.348
Get help for that tooth.

33:26.572 --> 33:30.209
Is everything okay?
Are you still out? It's late.

33:30.276 --> 33:31.443
Yeah, but I'm heading back now.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.145
Listen, I spoke to Stephanie

33:33.212 --> 33:36.548
and Whittaker's in a band
called Death Cult.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.084
Hang on.

33:41.153 --> 33:42.921
'
- Yeah, I'm fine.

33:42.988 --> 33:45.757
I was just looking something up.
I've taken a wrong turn.

33:45.824 --> 33:47.259
Where are you?

33:47.326 --> 33:50.196
I've just gone under
the shopping precinct.

33:50.262 --> 33:52.131
Have you seen something?

33:52.198 --> 33:55.301
No. No, I'm fine.
I'm just a bit jumpy.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.703
'Where exactly are you?
Street name?'

33:57.769 --> 34:00.906
Well, I'm not quite sure
this has a name, actually.

34:03.675 --> 34:04.743
'Robin!'

34:04.810 --> 34:06.112
Robin.

34:19.158 --> 34:20.192
Robin!

34:24.330 --> 34:25.497
'Robin.'

34:52.991 --> 34:54.560
He caught me.

34:56.728 --> 34:57.896
Sorry, I messed up.

34:57.963 --> 34:59.731
'I'm not here to tell you off.'

34:59.798 --> 35:00.966
How did you manage to--

35:01.032 --> 35:02.734
I told you,
I did a self-defense course.

35:02.801 --> 35:05.504
He grabbed me from behind,
so I did what they taught me.

35:06.805 --> 35:07.939
Kneed him in the groin.

35:09.541 --> 35:11.677
Whittaker's disappeared.
They're looking for him.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.246
I just..

35:14.313 --> 35:18.116
Whittaker's sort of thin,
and he..

35:18.184 --> 35:21.052
The guy that attacked me
had a-a different build.

35:21.119 --> 35:22.421
Uh, I looked up
Whittaker's band.

35:22.488 --> 35:24.556
They had a gig the night
Kelsey was killed.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.892
I just..

35:26.958 --> 35:28.360
I don't think it was him.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.664
I still want to work.

35:32.731 --> 35:34.900
Well, you've got
your wedding to think about.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.068
Don't patronize me. Thanks.

35:37.135 --> 35:40.172
You can leave us alone now.
Robin needs her rest.

35:40.239 --> 35:42.241
Matthew's right.
You should rest.

35:42.308 --> 35:45.010
Cormoran, what are we doing
about Brockbank?

35:45.076 --> 35:46.111
The police are watching him.

35:46.178 --> 35:47.346
'Well, it's not where he goes.'

35:47.413 --> 35:49.248
It's what he does
inside the flat.

35:49.315 --> 35:50.316
We can't save everyone.

35:50.382 --> 35:51.650
You were nearly killed tonight.

35:51.717 --> 35:54.420
'Let someone else
take this one on.'

35:54.486 --> 35:56.522
Cormoran, we can't
leave him with children.

36:00.626 --> 36:03.629
- Fine, I need to rest.
- I get why you wanna help--

36:03.695 --> 36:05.231
I need to rest.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.500
Back in a minute.

36:11.237 --> 36:13.239
Cormoran, this has to end.

36:13.305 --> 36:16.708
She's barely trained and you
send her out with no support?

36:16.775 --> 36:18.444
You're a sociopath.

37:03.655 --> 37:06.925
Hello?

37:06.992 --> 37:09.561
'Is that Ray?
This is Cormoran Strike.'

37:09.628 --> 37:13.665
I'd like you and Hazel to look
at some photos of suspects.

37:13.732 --> 37:17.403
Th-they're not great pictures,
but they might jog your memory.

37:17.469 --> 37:19.505
Hazel needs some space.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.540
Don't you understand that,
fella?

37:30.248 --> 37:31.650
Oh, sorry. One second.

37:34.553 --> 37:36.822
Uh, can I just have a minute?
Thanks.

37:40.459 --> 37:43.629
Shanker, hi.
Thanks for calling back.

37:43.695 --> 37:46.097
Yeah, he, uh, he told me
to give you a call.

37:46.164 --> 37:47.933
I need some help.

37:58.744 --> 38:01.347
Sayin' the girl's to get her
stitches out, innit?

38:01.413 --> 38:04.015
Hang on a sec.

38:04.082 --> 38:08.920
If that Cormoran Strike calls
while I'm away, hang up.

38:08.987 --> 38:10.489
I don't trust him.

38:22.601 --> 38:24.302
I'm just poppin' out.

38:25.437 --> 38:28.407
- Um, police interview.

38:28.474 --> 38:29.675
Can't I come too?

38:29.741 --> 38:31.410
'Well, they want me
to have a look'

38:31.477 --> 38:32.744
at some stuff
they can't take off-site.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.279
'Are you sure you're okay?'

38:34.346 --> 38:36.482
Yeah, I'm fine.
I won't use the arm.

39:10.516 --> 39:12.317
- She's coming.

39:12.384 --> 39:14.453
'Fit black girl, two kids.'

39:14.520 --> 39:15.754
Positive you don't want me
in there?

39:15.821 --> 39:18.023
No. No, keep an eye out for him.

39:23.662 --> 39:26.331
- Ooh.

39:26.398 --> 39:29.167
It's alright, darlin'.

39:29.234 --> 39:31.302
- Alyssa.

39:31.369 --> 39:33.238
Uh, could I have a word?

39:33.304 --> 39:34.706
It's about Noel.

39:34.773 --> 39:37.142
- 'Um..'

39:38.844 --> 39:41.680
Could we talk inside?
It's important.

39:43.214 --> 39:45.951
Upstairs, Angel.
Take your sister.

39:59.498 --> 40:01.166
I, um..

40:03.334 --> 40:06.037
Well, spit it out then.

40:06.104 --> 40:08.173
My name's Robin.

40:08.239 --> 40:10.576
I'm a...investigator.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.679
Cou-could we, um..

40:16.482 --> 40:19.951
Look, this is gonna be

40:20.018 --> 40:21.587
quite hard to hear

40:21.653 --> 40:23.655
but during the course of a case

40:23.722 --> 40:25.524
we've been working on,
we found out--

40:25.591 --> 40:27.959
Sorry, who's this we?

40:28.026 --> 40:29.995
So, I..

40:30.061 --> 40:33.532
I work for an agency that's run
by a guy called Cormoran Strike

40:33.599 --> 40:35.233
and we've been looking
into Noel's--

40:35.300 --> 40:37.903
Alright, then.
You can get out now.

40:37.969 --> 40:38.970
No, I-I really--

40:39.037 --> 40:40.739
'Now, I know
who Cormoran Strike is.'

40:40.806 --> 40:43.542
He gave my boyfriend epilepsy.
Just get out.

40:43.609 --> 40:44.976
- Please. Alyssa, please.
- Right now.

40:45.043 --> 40:46.845
- Just listen to this--
- Well, he sent him up.

40:46.912 --> 40:48.980
Ruined his marriage.
I know all about you lot.

40:49.047 --> 40:52.217
Noel sexually abuses young
girls. I am really sorry, but--

40:52.283 --> 40:55.353
Get out of my house before
I give you a proper smack.

40:55.420 --> 40:57.355
He has been doing it
for a long time.

40:57.422 --> 40:58.824
Just ask your daughters.

40:58.890 --> 41:01.026
- Get out!
- Ow! Ah!

41:02.928 --> 41:04.062
Mum.

41:09.635 --> 41:11.469
Just ask her.

41:13.471 --> 41:15.974
Upstairs, Angel, now!

41:18.777 --> 41:20.846
What's goin' on?
You alright, Angel?

41:20.912 --> 41:23.448
'Noel, this bitch
is telling lies about you.'

41:23.515 --> 41:24.883
Is she now?

41:24.950 --> 41:27.152
Said she's with Cormoran Strike.

41:31.757 --> 41:33.058
Look after Angel.

41:36.628 --> 41:39.430
You're not phonin' anyone.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.032
Stay there.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.637
He done it to me.

41:47.038 --> 41:48.506
'What?'

41:49.708 --> 41:51.276
What's the idea?

41:51.342 --> 41:55.180
Bargin' into people's houses,
upsettin' their kids, eh?

41:56.281 --> 41:57.749
What the lady said.

42:00.418 --> 42:02.420
W

42:02.487 --> 42:04.623
Now she barks at Strike.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.291
Ah, Shanker!

42:10.996 --> 42:12.097
Shanker!

42:13.965 --> 42:16.534
You dirty nonce. I'll skin ya.

42:16.602 --> 42:18.536
- Shanker, do not stab him.
- No.

42:33.885 --> 42:36.955
Why didn't you say
anything, darlin'?

42:37.022 --> 42:39.157
Because he said
he'd hurt Zaharah.

42:58.209 --> 43:00.145
- Look, we're actually--
- I don't care.

43:02.648 --> 43:04.115
Robin!

43:10.521 --> 43:12.824
'I told you we were leaving
Brockbank to the police.'

43:12.891 --> 43:15.093
- I know.
- 'And you went in anyway.'

43:16.427 --> 43:18.630
He was raping Alyssa's daughter.

43:18.697 --> 43:20.065
Wardle thinks
I sent you in there.

43:20.131 --> 43:21.867
And now, thanks to you,
Brockbank's vanished.

43:21.933 --> 43:24.135
- Don't you dare put that on me.
- I do.

43:24.202 --> 43:26.404
If you hadn't messed up,
Brockbank would have been

43:26.471 --> 43:27.939
in prison years ago.

43:28.006 --> 43:30.041
Laing is a cripple.
You ruled out Whittaker.

43:30.108 --> 43:32.310
That means that Brockbank
was our number one suspect

43:32.377 --> 43:35.747
and now he's off the radar.
We're finished.

43:35.814 --> 43:38.249
- You don't mean that.
- I'll send your last salary on.

43:38.316 --> 43:41.086
Quick and clean.
Gross misconduct.

43:51.596 --> 43:53.732
It's probably
for the best, love.

44:12.718 --> 44:15.153
Goodbye forever,
Cormoran Strike.

45:16.782 --> 45:19.417
- Hello.
- 'Uncle Ted.'

45:19.484 --> 45:20.852
Oh, hello, Cormoran.

45:20.919 --> 45:22.620
Were you at mum's grave
recently?

45:22.687 --> 45:26.157
'I wasn't, but I had
a friend pop something'

45:26.224 --> 45:28.827
'on the grave
for the anniversary.'

45:28.894 --> 45:30.862
It's sea holly, isn't it?

45:30.929 --> 45:32.263
Not much to look at right now.

45:32.330 --> 45:36.101
But come June,
it'll be rather special.

45:36.167 --> 45:38.103
Call me next time
you're up, alright?

45:38.169 --> 45:40.171
- 'Right.'
- Take care.

45:40.238 --> 45:41.439
'Bye.'

45:43.208 --> 45:44.275
Gotcha.

45:46.845 --> 45:49.180
Donnie did some work
for Mrs. Williams

45:49.247 --> 45:50.748
across the road.

45:50.816 --> 45:52.283
Eighty-seven with a lawn to cut

45:52.350 --> 45:55.053
and all her family
have gone abroad.

45:55.120 --> 45:58.689
Why is he here? Close the door.

45:58.756 --> 46:01.159
Is that the famous
Cormoran Strike?

46:04.462 --> 46:06.231
I need the number
for the fire service.

46:06.297 --> 46:08.466
Not the emergency number,
the one for people

46:08.533 --> 46:09.901
who hire firemen.

46:36.895 --> 46:39.197
'Let me guess.
You want a favor.'

46:39.264 --> 46:41.799
I need you to watch my back.

46:41.867 --> 46:43.801
Can you meet me at Elephant
at 8:00?

46:43.869 --> 46:46.571
- 'Right.'
- I'll text you the address.

46:48.573 --> 46:49.841
'Cheers.'

47:27.178 --> 47:29.747
Donnie. That you, Donnie?

47:29.814 --> 47:31.316
What's that smell?

47:31.382 --> 47:34.019
Gas. I got a call from upstairs.
Probably coming from here.

47:34.085 --> 47:35.853
We're not gonna get blown up,
are we?

47:35.921 --> 47:37.855
Well, don't light
any cigarettes.

47:37.923 --> 47:39.857
Shit. Alright.

47:39.925 --> 47:42.160
Um, is Donnie in there?
He owes me 40 quid.

47:42.227 --> 47:44.762
Afraid I can't help you, mate.

47:44.829 --> 47:46.164
Cheers.

49:42.313 --> 49:43.548
Where are you, bastard?

49:47.685 --> 49:48.719
Bunsen?

49:53.124 --> 49:54.425
'Bunsen!'

49:55.393 --> 49:56.661
'Bunsen!'

50:06.037 --> 50:07.472
'Bunsen!'

50:11.276 --> 50:13.078
'What's going on?'

50:13.144 --> 50:14.712
'Bunsen, open up!'

50:24.289 --> 50:26.724
'Calls to this number
have been blocked.'

50:32.363 --> 50:34.865
'What kept you?'

50:34.932 --> 50:36.634
This steel door.

50:44.542 --> 50:46.777
'They're still cleanin' up
but Forensics think'

50:46.844 --> 50:48.746
'there's more than one body
in there.'

50:50.648 --> 50:54.219
'So, what made you think Ray
and Laing were the same person?'

50:54.285 --> 50:56.821
The photo Ray gave the police
has him on the beach

50:56.887 --> 50:59.157
next to sea holly in full bloom

50:59.224 --> 51:01.292
supposedly in April.

51:01.359 --> 51:03.494
It was like
the coffee shop photo.

51:05.163 --> 51:08.099
- It was staged.

51:08.166 --> 51:09.400
Yeah.

51:09.467 --> 51:12.503
Sea holly doesn't flower
in the wild till June.

51:12.570 --> 51:14.472
'If you find
the other bloke, Ritchie'

51:14.539 --> 51:16.741
I'm sure he'll tell you
that it was taken last year.

51:16.807 --> 51:20.445
Height of summer, but they put
coats on to try and look cold.

51:20.511 --> 51:22.347
Ritchie probably thought
he was taking part

51:22.413 --> 51:24.549
in a benefit scam or something.

51:24.615 --> 51:26.751
I'm imagining
Ritchie's none too clever.

51:28.153 --> 51:30.020
There was a certificate
for bravery

51:30.087 --> 51:32.390
hanging in Kelsey's
sister's house.

51:33.491 --> 51:35.426
I called the fire service.

51:35.493 --> 51:37.662
'The real Ray Williams,
Mrs. William's son'

51:37.728 --> 51:40.698
'retired to Spain
six years ago.'

51:40.765 --> 51:42.300
Laing stole his identity.

51:42.367 --> 51:44.369
He was good at accents
and he spent a lot of money

51:44.435 --> 51:46.137
disguising his appearance.

51:46.204 --> 51:47.472
He even managed to find a girl

51:47.538 --> 51:49.774
who'd made the mistake
of having a crush on me.

51:54.645 --> 51:57.615
I'll come down to the station
tomorrow morning.

51:57.682 --> 51:59.150
Sounds good.

52:06.757 --> 52:08.326
We picked up Brockbank.

52:11.061 --> 52:12.597
Get some sleep.

52:52.903 --> 52:55.440
Daddy wouldn't do that.

52:55.506 --> 52:57.242
I didn't mean any of it.

53:15.560 --> 53:17.862
I'm a friend of Brittany.

53:21.566 --> 53:23.534
- Won't be long.
- Alright.

54:02.873 --> 54:04.675
What'll happen to him now?

54:06.210 --> 54:08.413
Nothing that involves you.

54:08.479 --> 54:11.982
He'll be tried and put away
for a very long time.

54:12.049 --> 54:15.720
And when he's released, he'll be
on the sex offender's register.

54:15.786 --> 54:16.821
For life.

54:16.887 --> 54:17.988
That's good.

54:19.657 --> 54:22.827
I wanted you to know...
before, you know.

54:25.863 --> 54:28.999
He should've been put in prison
a long time ago.

54:29.066 --> 54:31.001
We failed you there, Brittany.

54:32.169 --> 54:33.471
I failed you.

54:33.538 --> 54:35.873
You believed me, though.

54:35.940 --> 54:37.475
And you tried.

54:37.542 --> 54:39.009
That helped a lot.

54:41.211 --> 54:43.013
Was it you who caught him?

54:44.415 --> 54:46.717
No. It was my partner.

54:46.784 --> 54:50.220
- No.

54:50.287 --> 54:52.657
- But she did it anyway.
- Yep.

54:54.091 --> 54:56.361
Is she alright?

54:56.427 --> 55:00.030
She's a bit bruised,
but she'll live.

55:00.097 --> 55:01.566
Will you thank her for this?

55:03.601 --> 55:05.970
What's her name, your partner?

55:07.171 --> 55:08.939
Her name is Robin.

55:16.146 --> 55:18.516
We've got a second stop.
Yorkshire.

55:18.583 --> 55:21.619
- Yorkshire.

55:21.686 --> 55:24.389
The county. You know, Yorkshire.

55:27.024 --> 55:29.494
Just keep going north
till I tell you to stop.

56:01.526 --> 56:03.961
- Put your foot down.
- It's down.

56:04.028 --> 56:06.030
- Put it down further.
- Jesus.

56:06.096 --> 56:08.666
I am not havin' this
for the next hundred miles.

56:15.806 --> 56:18.142
At last, you solved it then,
innit?

56:18.208 --> 56:19.810
Better being
the hero of the hour.

56:19.877 --> 56:21.879
Yeah.

56:21.946 --> 56:24.915
I mean, there's no
fixing everything, but..

56:24.982 --> 56:27.918
Nah, nah, there's not much,
just life, innit, mate?

56:35.793 --> 56:37.261
What's the deal then, Bunsen?

56:37.327 --> 56:39.129
You're gonna full on graduate?

56:39.196 --> 56:41.365
Elaine! Elaine!

56:41.432 --> 56:43.434
What about me?

56:43.501 --> 56:46.537
No, I was invited.
I'm a friend, a guest.

56:46.604 --> 56:48.939
Oh, you're a friend? Yeah,
right. You sacked her, mate.

56:49.006 --> 56:51.175
That's not exactly a friend
where I come from.

56:55.112 --> 56:58.082
- Reminds me of your mum.

56:58.148 --> 57:00.417
Who? Your Robin.

57:00.485 --> 57:02.753
She kind, isn't she?

57:02.820 --> 57:05.890
Right away,
she wanted to save that kid.

57:05.956 --> 57:07.625
Well, I'm going to try
and get her back, aren't I?

57:07.692 --> 57:09.026
But next time she calls you,
if she calls you--

57:09.093 --> 57:11.128
Yeah, alright, yeah,
I'll call you first.

57:11.195 --> 57:12.863
- Yeah, alright.

57:12.930 --> 57:14.865

57:40.491 --> 57:43.227
Do, you, Matthew John Cunliffe

57:43.293 --> 57:47.464
take Robin Venetia Ellacott
to be your wife?

57:47.532 --> 57:50.134
Will you love her, comfort her

honor and protect her

57:54.505 --> 57:56.306
be faithful to her

57:56.373 --> 57:58.676
as long as you both shall live?

58:00.077 --> 58:01.612
I do.

'Do you, Robin Venetia Ellacott'

58:05.683 --> 58:09.419
'take Matthew John Cunliffe
to be your husband?'

58:09.486 --> 58:12.289

58:18.663 --> 58:21.431
'as long as you both
shall live?'

58:24.635 --> 58:25.870
Sorry.

58:33.210 --> 58:34.478
I do.
