00:05.273 --> 00:07.508
[girl] Previously on
Make It or Break It:

00:07.541 --> 00:10.044
I'll be able to recover in time
for the Olympics?

00:10.078 --> 00:12.580
If you do gymnastics,
you may never walk again.

00:12.613 --> 00:15.283
- [sobbing] My God.
- You slept with my boyfriend?

00:15.316 --> 00:18.586
I'll be your teammate,
but I'll never be
your friend again.

00:18.619 --> 00:22.090
I'm lifting your suspension.
I'm giving you a second chance.
Don't blow it.

00:22.123 --> 00:26.294
- You OK with me being here?
- I'll stay so focused,
I'll barely notice you.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.461
Why would my dad
blackmail Marty?

00:27.495 --> 00:29.397
Marty was sleeping with my mom.

00:29.430 --> 00:32.466
Damon, this is Emily Kmetko.
Watch out for her while I'm out.

00:32.500 --> 00:33.601
Yes, sir.

00:33.634 --> 00:34.602
I sent some songs
to a producer.

00:34.635 --> 00:36.304
They sent me a ticket to LA.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.406
- I leave next week.
- Yo, brother!

00:38.439 --> 00:40.474
Just got back from a
couple months on the road.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.576
- Emily, will you wait for me?
- Yes.

00:46.514 --> 00:49.150
Mom? We've got to go!

00:49.183 --> 00:52.320
OK, OK. I just
have to put my face on.

00:52.353 --> 00:55.156
I can't be late!
The National Committee
is coming this morning

00:55.189 --> 00:56.557
to name the
National Team coach.

00:56.590 --> 00:58.559
And you have
your makeup on.

00:58.592 --> 01:00.528
Oh, honey,
this is just primer.

01:02.630 --> 01:05.233
Have you seen
my National Team jacket?
I have to wear it.

01:05.266 --> 01:08.202
I think I washed it.
Check the laundry basket
in the bedroom.

01:08.236 --> 01:12.106
Now, if The Rock is gonna be
the National Team home gym,

01:12.140 --> 01:14.375
doesn't that mean they're gonna
pick Sasha to be the coach?

01:14.408 --> 01:16.444
That's why this
is such a big deal.

01:16.477 --> 01:19.413
Having your coach
as the National Team coach
is a huge advantage,

01:19.447 --> 01:22.550
which I'm gonna need, especially
since I barely made the team.

01:22.583 --> 01:26.387
- What did you wash this with?
- Oh, no!

01:26.420 --> 01:29.157
- It's ruined!
- No! No, it's not!

01:29.190 --> 01:30.658
I can fix this.
Don't worry.

01:30.691 --> 01:35.129
Look. Just wear my hoodie
in the meantime.

01:35.163 --> 01:38.266
It's blue-ish.
I bet no one will even notice.

01:38.299 --> 01:40.668
Great. My jacket is ruined
and we're gonna be late.

01:40.701 --> 01:43.671
No, we're not! I'm gonna
put my makeup on in the car!

01:43.704 --> 01:47.508
Oh. Putting on your makeup
while you drive.
That's a great idea.

01:47.541 --> 01:51.279
Oh, honey, I've done
worse things while driving.

01:51.312 --> 01:53.447
- Like what?
- Never mind.

01:53.481 --> 01:56.584
I'll put my makeup on
in the parking lot.
Now, come on! Let's go!

02:01.589 --> 02:05.526
Now, remember, you're here
as supportive dad,

02:05.559 --> 02:08.596
- not as her manager.
- I'm being supportive.

02:08.629 --> 02:13.234
Good. Then maybe you could
wipe that scowl off your face.

02:19.607 --> 02:21.175
What is she doing here?

02:22.610 --> 02:24.612
Hi, teamies.

02:24.645 --> 02:27.581
Hi. I thought
Friday was trash day.

02:27.615 --> 02:32.653
Funny. You know, almost as funny
as the condoms you planted
in my gym bag at Nationals.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.722
[laughs] No,
that was way funnier.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.458
- What are you doing here?
- Denver's so close,

02:37.491 --> 02:40.594
I thought I'd pop over
to schmooze the new
National Team coach.

02:40.628 --> 02:43.731
You can kiss Sasha's butt
all you want,
but we'll always come first.

02:43.764 --> 02:47.735
You're right,
having your own coach
is a huge advantage.

02:47.768 --> 02:50.571
He decides which girls
go to all the big meets.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.773
And don't you forget it.
[chuckles]

02:55.476 --> 02:57.978
Wow. That's pathetic.

02:58.011 --> 03:00.614
If I could never
do gymnastics again,

03:00.648 --> 03:02.750
I wouldn't hang around
the gym like a has been.

03:02.783 --> 03:06.587
Because you don't have
any friends who would care
enough to see your face again.

03:06.620 --> 03:09.457
Says the girl who slept
with her bestie's boyfriend.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.393
I bet you'd really
be missed around here.

03:12.426 --> 03:14.695
Would you both just shut up.

03:15.629 --> 03:17.565
Hi. Look who's here.

03:17.598 --> 03:19.533
- Hey, Pay, I'm glad you came.
- Thanks.

03:19.567 --> 03:21.669
We're here to hear
the big announcement.

03:21.702 --> 03:23.771
- It's not official yet.
- Hey.

03:23.804 --> 03:27.641
- Hey, great banner.
- Oh, I thought it was festive.

03:27.675 --> 03:29.510
Looks like I left
the gym in good hands.

03:29.543 --> 03:32.246
And Summer
invited the press.

03:32.280 --> 03:36.384
Well, the publicity is good for
The Rock and good for you, too.

03:36.417 --> 03:39.453
- Fine.
- Oh! They're...

03:39.487 --> 03:41.455
They're ready. Excuse me.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.624
- Are you nervous?
- Apprehensive.

03:43.657 --> 03:47.461
Don't be. They never would
have chosen The Rock if they
weren't gonna choose you.

03:47.495 --> 03:51.231
Plus, you got three girls
on the National team. That's
more than any other club.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.336
It should have been four.

03:57.571 --> 04:00.308
Listen, I need all
the help I can get,

04:00.341 --> 04:01.642
and all the girls
look up to you.

04:01.675 --> 04:05.679
So how would you like
to be my assistant coach?

04:05.713 --> 04:08.849
- Oh, that is so...
- I'm not interested
in coaching.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.687
- Payson.
- But thank you for the offer.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.023
[man] If we could have
your attention, please?

04:16.056 --> 04:19.560
First of all,
we want to say how happy we are

04:19.593 --> 04:24.432
to have such a fine club
hosting the National Team
practices and the U.S. meets.

04:24.465 --> 04:27.768
- [applause]
- [chanting] Rock! Rock! Rock!

04:30.338 --> 04:33.307
It must be distracting
training with the ex
that broke your heart.

04:33.341 --> 04:38.446
Look, you can try all you want,
but nothing and no one
is gonna mess with my head.

04:38.479 --> 04:41.315
We all know
why we're here today.

04:41.349 --> 04:43.517
[Chloe] Sorry we're late!
My fault!

04:43.551 --> 04:48.322
- Carry on!
- What team jacket is that?
Team Tacky?

04:48.356 --> 04:52.393
[man] So without further ado,
it is with great excitement

04:52.426 --> 04:56.063
that we are pleased to announce
this year's National Team coach

04:56.096 --> 05:00.067
is Marty Walsh from
The Denver Elite Club!

05:00.100 --> 05:02.670
[applause]

05:34.167 --> 05:36.637
- [applause]
- [Kaylie] This is crazy.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.606
No way I'm gonna be coached
by Marty Walsh.

05:38.639 --> 05:40.674
Doesn't look like
you have a choice.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.543
Unless you care
to abdicate your title.

05:42.576 --> 05:45.145
Nobody expects you
to hold onto it anyway.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.549
Thank you all for that,
uh, warm reception.

05:48.582 --> 05:51.452
You knew they were
picking Marty, didn't you?

05:51.485 --> 05:54.655
Well, duh. I'm gonna go
congratulate my coach.

05:54.688 --> 05:58.492
And, uh, don't you forget
who has the advantage now.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.494
I'll see you girls
at practice tomorrow.

06:02.796 --> 06:05.833
As to my friend and esteemed
colleague, Sasha Belov,

06:05.866 --> 06:07.901
thank you for your hospitality.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.903
The Rock is a fine club,

06:09.937 --> 06:13.807
and I know when all 12
National Team members arrive

06:13.841 --> 06:17.678
for our first team practice
tomorrow, they'll feel
right at home.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.913
Thank you very much.

06:19.947 --> 06:22.716
[applause]

06:24.652 --> 06:27.688
How can they bring
Marty back here?
The Rock is Sasha's gym now.

06:27.721 --> 06:31.859
Thank God the National Team only
practices together once a month.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.827
Mom, that's not the point.

06:33.861 --> 06:36.530
Sasha deserves
to be the National coach.

06:36.564 --> 06:40.668
I agree. Unfortunately,
people don't always
get what they deserve.

06:45.606 --> 06:48.976
- [Sasha] Congratulations.
- I'm as surprised as you are.

06:49.009 --> 06:52.212
Are you surprised?
I think we both could
have predicted this.

06:52.245 --> 06:56.584
- Sasha, that was years ago.
- Hm. And history repeats.

06:56.617 --> 07:00.588
In any case, uh,
the National Team,
we're in excellent hands

07:00.621 --> 07:02.723
and we're honored
to host you here at The Rock.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.993
- So no hard feelings, right?
- I wouldn't go that far.

07:08.829 --> 07:11.665
Emily, can I have a word
with you and your mother?

07:11.699 --> 07:15.869
- If this is about
my team jacket...
- Oh! It's at the dry cleaners.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.738
Actually, this is
about her math scores.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.874
She'll have to maintain
a B average in order
to remain on the team.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.910
But she gets straight
A's in everything else.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.745
Your daughter
is a role model now.

07:24.778 --> 07:27.648
We hold our girls
to high academic as well
as gymnastic standards.

07:27.681 --> 07:28.716
Perhaps a tutor
might be helpful.

07:28.749 --> 07:32.653
You know what? Sure,
we'll get a tutor. No problem.

07:32.686 --> 07:35.789
And she'll do better than a B.
She'll get an A.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.959
- I'm sure she will.
- Mm-hm.

07:40.928 --> 07:42.796
- What?
- An A?

07:43.597 --> 07:45.699
Kaylie?

07:45.733 --> 07:48.602
I didn't get a chance to
congratulate you at Nationals.

07:48.636 --> 07:50.003
You were incredible.

07:50.037 --> 07:52.973
But then I always
knew you had it in you

07:53.006 --> 07:56.744
to be a champion
and I'm really looking forward
to coaching you again.

07:56.777 --> 07:58.011
Well, that makes one of us.

08:03.817 --> 08:06.654
I bet Kelly Parker paid off
the National Committee.

08:06.687 --> 08:08.656
And here go
the conspiracy theories.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.658
Why would they pick
The Rock but not Sasha?

08:10.691 --> 08:12.793
Look, we need to talk.
After practice.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.596
- I can't. I have to work.
- Fine.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.698
We'll meet at the Pizza Shack.

08:19.733 --> 08:21.969
There you go. Thanks.

08:26.640 --> 08:28.809
You expecting someone?

08:28.842 --> 08:31.979
Look, there's something
you don't know about me.

08:32.012 --> 08:34.548
You're dating
my best friend.

08:34.582 --> 08:37.050
Oh, wait,
I did know that.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.553
But it's cool.
It's cool. Yeah.

08:39.587 --> 08:42.022
Whatever blows your
skirt up, so to speak.

08:42.055 --> 08:44.892
Look, when you left
to go on the road,
you and I were just friends.

08:47.327 --> 08:50.931
I wouldn't even say friends.
More like co-workers.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.634
Right.

08:53.667 --> 08:57.871
Anyway, there was something I
never got a chance to tell you.

08:57.905 --> 09:00.741
- You're a Scientologist?
- [scoffs] No.

09:01.742 --> 09:04.678
President of the
school Abstinence Club?

09:04.712 --> 09:06.714
Actually, I'm home-schooled.

09:06.747 --> 09:08.782
Oh, you're one of those.

09:08.816 --> 09:11.118
I'm home-schooled
because I'm an elite gymnast

09:11.151 --> 09:14.722
and I spend eight hours
a day training at The Rock.

09:14.755 --> 09:17.591
Wait.

09:17.625 --> 09:20.661
That gym where country-club
people take their
toe-headed tots to tumble?

09:20.694 --> 09:22.963
It's a little more
professional than that.

09:22.996 --> 09:26.734
We have three members
on the Women's National
Gymnastics Team.

09:26.767 --> 09:30.738
- And I'm one of them.
- Wow.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.708
All right.
So you're a Gumby girl.

09:34.742 --> 09:37.611
So during our six-hour shifts,
five nights a week,

09:37.645 --> 09:41.014
you never thought to work
that into our conversation?

09:41.048 --> 09:43.884
- It's complicated.
- Oh.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.654
How long did it
take you to tell Damon?

09:46.687 --> 09:49.389
Actually,
my mother told him.

09:49.422 --> 09:53.627
Anyway, a couple of my
friends from The Rock are...

09:53.661 --> 09:54.695
Are here.

09:58.799 --> 10:00.734
[Razor] What happened to her?

10:00.768 --> 10:03.771
Gumby girls
don't always bend.

10:03.804 --> 10:06.206
Sometimes, we break.

10:09.777 --> 10:12.045
Sasha should be our coach and
we should have a say in it.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.847
We're all on the National Team.

10:13.881 --> 10:17.785
The worst part is that Marty's
gonna be playing favorites

10:17.818 --> 10:21.121
- with Kelly Parker.
- Favorites was fine when you
thought Sasha was the coach.

10:21.154 --> 10:25.425
- Hey, we're on the same side.
- Unfortunately, I can't
do anything about that.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.662
But we gotta find
a way to get rid of Marty.

10:28.696 --> 10:32.666
We could tell the National
Committee that he had
an affair with your mom.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.803
And we can tell them that
your father blackmailed him,

10:35.836 --> 10:38.438
which I believe is a felony.

10:38.471 --> 10:40.974
The only good thing
about having a broken back

10:41.008 --> 10:43.777
is I don't have to deal
with all The Rock drama anymore.

10:43.811 --> 10:45.746
Come on, Pay. You're
still a part of this team.

10:46.747 --> 10:49.649
Am I?

10:50.751 --> 10:52.119
You guys are on your own.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.154
- Bathroom?
- In the back.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.756
I don't need help.

11:00.493 --> 11:04.464
- What's with her, anyway?
- What do you think?

11:04.497 --> 11:07.200
She's lost everything
she ever wanted.

11:07.234 --> 11:10.170
It must be torture for her
to see us living our dream.

11:10.203 --> 11:14.674
Our dream is going to be a
nightmare if we don't figure
out a way to get Marty fired.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.078
How can we get him fired?

11:18.111 --> 11:20.781
Well, the National
Committee members

11:20.814 --> 11:23.717
are observing practice
tomorrow, right?

11:23.751 --> 11:24.952
Right.

11:24.985 --> 11:28.722
So, what if we make
Marty look bad.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.791
Really bad.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.695
This is all your fault!

11:35.729 --> 11:40.033
I'm not responsible
for the National Committee
choosing Marty over Sasha.

11:40.067 --> 11:43.804
Yeah. Which maybe I could
live with if you hadn't
had an affair with him!

11:45.105 --> 11:46.874
[whispering] What do
you want me to do?

11:46.907 --> 11:49.877
Nothing.
I'll get rid of him myself.

11:49.910 --> 11:52.980
I hope we're
talking about Marty.

11:53.013 --> 11:55.248
What's wrong?

11:57.017 --> 11:59.052
Nothing. We just
didn't hear you come in.

11:59.086 --> 12:02.823
- Yeah.
- Well, if you ask me,

12:02.856 --> 12:06.760
somebody bought off
the National Committee.
Somebody like Steve Tanner.

12:06.794 --> 12:10.097
- Why would Steve Tanner
choose Marty over Sasha?
- We know he owns Marty.

12:10.130 --> 12:13.266
How else does he get him
to Denver when all the best
girls were at The Rock?

12:15.135 --> 12:17.304
Well, this time,
I'm not standing still.

12:17.337 --> 12:20.874
I'm gonna dig up all
the dirty little details,
and I'm taking Marty down.

12:24.945 --> 12:26.246
I can't do this anymore.

12:33.887 --> 12:36.523
I thought we agreed
that you were gonna
stop managing my career.

12:36.556 --> 12:40.027
I'm not doing this
as your manager. I'm doing
it as a concerned parent.

12:40.060 --> 12:44.097
None of the other parents
are trying to dig up dirt
or trying to bring Marty down.

12:44.131 --> 12:47.534
So I'd appreciate it
if you didn't get
involved in the politics

12:47.567 --> 12:50.137
at The Rock or at
the National Committee.

12:53.206 --> 12:55.175
You'd just embarrass me.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.349
Fine.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.885
But when you realize
you're only 16 years old

13:04.918 --> 13:08.021
and no one else has your back
like your dear old dad,

13:08.055 --> 13:10.190
I'll still be here for you.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.860
Just like I've always been.

13:20.968 --> 13:23.603
If Algebra is math, then
why is it all about letters?

13:23.636 --> 13:26.874
It's actually
not about letters.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.241
They are only used
to represent numbers

13:28.275 --> 13:32.245
which are either unknown
or change during
the course of the problem,

13:32.279 --> 13:36.316
in which case the letters
are called variables.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.321
You want to get high?

13:41.354 --> 13:43.323
No.

13:44.424 --> 13:46.026
I was kidding.

13:46.059 --> 13:48.896
Pot is a gateway drug.

13:48.929 --> 13:51.398
[chuckles] Right.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.933
Hi!

13:55.035 --> 13:57.337
Oh! Razor, right?

13:57.370 --> 14:01.208
Ah! So Emily has mentioned me?

14:01.241 --> 14:04.611
And here I thought she'd
totally forgot about me.

14:04.644 --> 14:08.882
So they only hire cute, charming
boys to work here, I see.

14:08.916 --> 14:10.417
Are you talking
about that other guy?

14:10.450 --> 14:12.319
Yeah. He was just
filling in for me.

14:12.352 --> 14:15.889
But I'm back now.

14:15.923 --> 14:19.226
I'm... gonna, um,
go get my stuff.

14:19.259 --> 14:20.427
Hm.

14:21.328 --> 14:23.396
[sighs]

14:23.430 --> 14:25.332
I almost failed algebra.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.902
Maybe I did fail algebra.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.972
- I guess it's genetic.
- Don't tell anyone,

14:32.005 --> 14:34.441
but, uh, I was a mathlete

14:34.474 --> 14:37.110
before I joined a band
and became so cool.

14:37.144 --> 14:39.012
Really?

14:41.048 --> 14:43.283
What part aren't you buying?
The math part or the cool part?

14:43.316 --> 14:47.320
- Oh, the math part.
- [laughs]

14:47.354 --> 14:52.425
You wouldn't by any
chance be interesting
in tutoring Emily?

15:05.738 --> 15:07.207
[Marty] Congratulations.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.243
You are the best women gymnasts
in the nation.

15:10.277 --> 15:13.380
And it's my job to make sure
that you become the best
in the world.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.483
But you are
all role models now.

15:16.516 --> 15:19.119
You are representing
this great nation of ours

15:19.152 --> 15:22.455
not just gymnastically
but ethically,

15:22.489 --> 15:24.958
and you'll be held
to high moral standards.

15:24.992 --> 15:27.961
- What a hypocrite!
- [Marty] You're competing
as a team now.

15:27.995 --> 15:32.265
This isn't about individual
glory, which is why we need
to help and support one another.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.500
Really?

15:35.268 --> 15:37.437
All right, then.
I've coached a few of you before

15:37.470 --> 15:41.308
so anyone new to the team,
just ask their teammates
what to expect.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.345
All right, ladies.
Let's get to work.

15:48.315 --> 15:51.351
Shall we educate our
teammates on their new coach?

15:51.384 --> 15:54.087
I don't know if I can do this.

15:54.121 --> 15:57.457
Hey. Don't forget,
Marty brought you to The Rock

15:57.490 --> 15:59.026
and walked out on you
after two days.

15:59.059 --> 16:04.964
But who believed in you,
who took you to Nationals
and who's never abandoned you?

16:06.266 --> 16:08.135
- Sasha.
- Right.

16:08.168 --> 16:12.139
Isn't this exciting? So you
guys have worked with Marty.

16:12.172 --> 16:15.175
- What's he like?
- I got this.

16:16.309 --> 16:19.179
Marty's great. But...

16:19.212 --> 16:22.149
...he tends to be
a little handsy.

16:22.182 --> 16:26.153
Oh, he's never
crossed the line, exactly,

16:26.186 --> 16:29.022
but unless you want
to open that door,

16:29.056 --> 16:31.558
don't let him touch you.
At all.

16:31.591 --> 16:34.294
So listen. I've trained
with Marty a long time,

16:34.327 --> 16:37.264
and he's got
this weird pet peeve.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.166
He hates to be looked
straight in the eye.

16:39.199 --> 16:41.534
He thinks it's disrespectful
or something.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.136
OK. Thanks for the heads up.

16:43.170 --> 16:45.505
* Ooh, la, la, la, la
Come on *

16:45.538 --> 16:48.541
* Ohh, la, la

16:48.575 --> 16:52.512
* Say ooh, la, la, la, la
Come on *

16:52.545 --> 16:55.448
* I'm coming fast
I'm coming hard *

16:55.482 --> 16:57.584
- * Ready to blow...
- Great, Tarah.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.487
But on that switch ring,
I need you to throw
your head back more.

17:00.520 --> 17:03.323
- You looking at me?
- No.

17:03.356 --> 17:05.558
I mean, yes.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.496
* Come on, come on, go

17:09.529 --> 17:12.465
- Nice dismount.
- Thanks.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.202
So, um, watch out for Marty.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.137
Why?

17:17.170 --> 17:20.573
He, uh...
has really bad breath.

17:20.607 --> 17:23.510
* Buh, buh, buh

17:23.543 --> 17:26.479
- * Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh
- OK, freeze.

17:26.513 --> 17:30.417
See where your
shoulders are?
I want them back like this.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.087
Can I please touch you? Here...

17:34.121 --> 17:36.456
[girl whimpers]

17:37.290 --> 17:38.658
Breath mint?

17:42.129 --> 17:45.198
Coach Walsh?
Could we have a word?

17:46.466 --> 17:49.369
* Ooh, la, la

17:49.402 --> 17:53.206
* Sing ooh, la, la, la, la
Come on, ya'll **

17:54.674 --> 17:58.845
Kaylie! Kaylie!

17:58.878 --> 18:02.115
- What the hell was
going on out there today?
- We were practicing.

18:02.149 --> 18:06.253
- You were sabotaging.
- We want you to be our coach.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.520
I am your coach,
here at The Rock.

18:07.554 --> 18:10.290
I expect you
to welcome your National
teammates and Marty Walsh

18:10.323 --> 18:12.525
respectfully and graciously.
Do you understand?

18:12.559 --> 18:15.328
- I can't work with Marty.
- Why?

18:17.397 --> 18:20.600
You want to get kicked
off the National Team?
That's the way you're headed.

18:20.633 --> 18:23.470
You're National Champion,
Kaylie. You're the leader now.

18:23.503 --> 18:27.140
It's your job to set
the right example.
And right now, you're failing.

18:27.174 --> 18:28.175
Miserably.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.420
[Marty] Payson.

18:40.453 --> 18:42.689
Hey. Hey, Kim.

18:42.722 --> 18:47.227
- Hi, Becca.
- I, uh...

18:47.260 --> 18:50.563
I just want to tell you know
how sorry I am about
what happened to you.

18:50.597 --> 18:53.200
I've never coached anyone

18:53.233 --> 18:55.368
with as much talent
and determination as you.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.571
You still have a lot
to offer the sport.

18:58.605 --> 19:01.208
If you're ever interested
in coaching...

19:01.241 --> 19:02.309
I'm not.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.344
Thanks.

19:08.615 --> 19:10.617
How's Kaylie
doing with all this?

19:10.650 --> 19:11.918
With all what?

19:11.951 --> 19:14.587
You know, Marty
back at The Rock after...

19:14.621 --> 19:18.191
After... he had an affair
with Kaylie's mother?

19:18.225 --> 19:21.528
- You know?
- Yes, Kaylie told me.

19:21.561 --> 19:23.263
We've been friends
for ten years.

19:23.296 --> 19:25.432
Did you really think a guy
could get between us?

19:25.465 --> 19:27.400
She's over you, Carter.

19:27.434 --> 19:29.536
You need to accept that
and move on.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.642
[cell phone rings]

19:40.680 --> 19:41.848
Kaylie?

19:44.651 --> 19:46.286
[* Matthew Perryman Jones:

19:46.319 --> 19:50.223

I'm glad you called me.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.738
Are you OK?

20:05.772 --> 20:09.476
My best friend
has a broken back,

20:09.509 --> 20:12.245
I have Kelly Parker
on my ass

20:12.279 --> 20:16.549
and my new coach is the man
my mom cheated on my dad with.

20:19.686 --> 20:23.790
And I feel like there's no one
in the world I can talk to.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.592
You can talk to me.

20:27.026 --> 20:29.662
Did I mention my other best
friend slept with my boyfriend?

20:35.435 --> 20:38.638
It's not supposed
to be like this.

20:38.671 --> 20:41.774
I'm the National
Gymnastics Champion!

20:41.808 --> 20:45.745
I should be on top of the world,
calling the shots.

20:45.778 --> 20:51.351
And instead, I feel like I can't
act too happy around Payson,

20:51.384 --> 20:53.320
I can't have
the coach I want

20:53.353 --> 20:58.691
and I feel like
I'm in the middle of all
of these secrets and betrayals.

20:58.725 --> 21:00.560
I won!

21:00.593 --> 21:03.596
It's finally supposed
to be about me!

21:03.630 --> 21:06.433
And it's still
about everybody else!

21:06.466 --> 21:09.469
What can I do?

21:12.739 --> 21:14.674
You can tell me why.

21:16.709 --> 21:19.579
Why did you have sex
with Lauren?

21:19.612 --> 21:23.550
And don't tell me that it's
because we had a fight
and you were drinking

21:23.583 --> 21:26.386
because that is
a pathetic excuse.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.588
I was angry.

21:31.090 --> 21:35.528
And I guess I felt
like I wanted to be with you

21:35.562 --> 21:37.597
more than you wanted
to be with me.

21:37.630 --> 21:40.367
So...

21:40.400 --> 21:43.570
So you wanted to hurt me?

21:45.372 --> 21:48.708
I don't know. Maybe.

21:52.479 --> 21:53.913
I am so sorry.

21:56.416 --> 21:57.650
I love you.

21:58.585 --> 22:01.488
I'm so sorry.
I love you.

22:12.532 --> 22:13.600
Kaylie.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.469
Kaylie, don't.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.704
Not like this.

22:17.737 --> 22:20.507
You can have sex with Lauren
but you can't have sex with me?

22:20.540 --> 22:22.609
You're angry and frustrated

22:22.642 --> 22:25.144
and you're doing this
so you feel in control.

22:25.177 --> 22:28.481
Why? Why can everybody else

22:28.515 --> 22:30.617
cheat and lie and have sex?

22:30.650 --> 22:33.720
- And why can't I just
do whatever I want?
- Kaylie.

22:33.753 --> 22:37.724
- Kaylie! I...
- Get out.

22:38.725 --> 22:41.694
* We're kicking at shadows

22:41.728 --> 22:44.631
* When everyone around us

22:44.664 --> 22:47.567
* Is making up chaos

22:47.600 --> 22:51.438
You can lash out at me
and hurt me back.

22:51.471 --> 22:53.673
You can even hate me.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.675
But we are soul mates
and belong together.

22:55.708 --> 22:58.745
And I'm not giving up on you.

23:18.731 --> 23:21.601
- Hi, honey, you're home.
- Surprise!

23:21.634 --> 23:24.704
- What is he doing here?
- He is here to tutor you.

23:24.737 --> 23:27.840
And from the looks
of these worksheets, you need
all the help you can get.

23:27.874 --> 23:32.979
- What do you know about math?
- Hey, I didn't
fail every subject.

23:33.012 --> 23:36.583
- Mom?
- You needed a tutor
and Razor volunteered.

23:36.616 --> 23:39.786
- Pro bono.
- That means for free.

23:39.819 --> 23:41.854
I get A's in English.
I know what it means.

23:41.888 --> 23:45.725
Now, English,
that was a different story.
All that reading and writing.

23:45.758 --> 23:47.494
When are you ever
gonna use that?

23:47.527 --> 23:51.598
But math? Not a day goes
by that I don't find myself

23:51.631 --> 23:54.734
trying to simplify the negative
exponents in fractions.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.603
[Chloe] Mm-hm.

23:56.636 --> 23:58.905
- [Emily scoffs]
- Right?

24:05.512 --> 24:07.680
How's it going, chickie?

24:07.714 --> 24:10.783
I always wondered who those
people were who had time
to surf the Net all day.

24:12.051 --> 24:13.753
They're me.

24:15.688 --> 24:19.559
Well, just because you
can't do gymnastics anymore

24:19.592 --> 24:22.662
- doesn't mean you can't...
- Please don't say coach.

24:22.695 --> 24:24.697
But you have
so much to offer.

24:24.731 --> 24:27.233
And all those girls
look up to you.

24:27.266 --> 24:29.936
Why not just consider it?

24:32.805 --> 24:34.907
Because it feels like
admitting that it's over.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.610
And I just...

24:37.644 --> 24:39.746
I just can't accept that yet.
OK? I just can't.

24:39.779 --> 24:43.516
I know. I'm sorry.
It's OK.

24:43.550 --> 24:44.917
All in good time.

24:56.563 --> 25:00.633
So I'm having a little
trouble fixing your
National Team jacket.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.802
Are you sure you can't
just ask for another one?

25:02.835 --> 25:05.838
- Positive.
- Um, well, what if I ask?

25:05.872 --> 25:09.976
Mom, I know you mean well,

25:10.009 --> 25:13.680
but I just think it works
better if you don't get
involved with my gymnastics.

25:13.713 --> 25:18.685
No offense, it's just
when you try to help,

25:18.718 --> 25:20.720
sometimes you just don't.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.756
I'm sorry.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.958
It's OK, sweetie.

25:25.992 --> 25:28.861
I understand. You got
here all by yourself,

25:28.895 --> 25:33.766
without any help from me,
and I promise I won't meddle.

25:33.800 --> 25:36.002
Thanks.
I'll see you later.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.773
Can I get all National Team
members lined up on the floor?

25:47.113 --> 25:48.948
[Marty clears throat]
Now, as you all know,

25:48.981 --> 25:52.018
only six of you will
get to compete in three weeks

25:52.051 --> 25:53.753
against the EU team in London.

25:53.786 --> 25:55.855
I can't wait! The shopping
is awesome in London.

25:55.888 --> 25:58.991
- I've never been to London.
- [Marty] Based
on yesterday's practice,

25:59.025 --> 26:01.093
I've already made the cut.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.830
Will the following girls
please step forward.

26:03.863 --> 26:04.864
Kaylie.

26:06.065 --> 26:07.700
Courtney.

26:07.734 --> 26:09.769
Tasha. Lindsay.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.906
Emily. And Lauren.

26:15.775 --> 26:20.046
Sorry you couldn't
come to London. But you can
always rent Mary Poppins.

26:21.714 --> 26:24.617
You girls will not
be going to London.

26:24.651 --> 26:27.620
- [laughs]
- What?

26:27.654 --> 26:29.989
I'm the National Champion.
You have to take me.

26:30.022 --> 26:32.692
Actually, I don't.
None of you girls can rest
on your laurels in practice.

26:32.725 --> 26:36.128
You have to bring it every day.
And yesterday, you six didn't.

26:36.162 --> 26:38.898
This isn't fair. What would
the National Committee say?

26:38.931 --> 26:43.770
After observing yesterday's
practice, they've approved
of my choices unanimously.

26:43.803 --> 26:45.705
So today's a new day.

26:45.738 --> 26:47.740
Let's get to work.
Oh, and don't forget.

26:47.774 --> 26:50.376
Tomorrow, you're all
gonna be signing your
National Team paperwork,

26:50.409 --> 26:52.011
and taking the
official photo.

26:52.044 --> 26:54.881
We need you all to be
in your team jackets.

26:54.914 --> 26:56.783
Thank you, ladies.

27:00.787 --> 27:03.089
You know, I'm actually sorry
you won't be going to London.

27:03.122 --> 27:07.026
Now the whole world
will have to wait to see
your fall from grace.

27:09.028 --> 27:11.063
I have just one thing
to say to you:

27:11.097 --> 27:14.801
"Super-califragilistic-
expialidocious."

27:14.834 --> 27:16.135
Stuff it!

27:22.074 --> 27:24.076
[gasps]

27:24.977 --> 27:27.747
OK, we need a new plan.

27:27.780 --> 27:30.116
No, we don't.
I got it covered.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.918
I'm telling my father.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.120
Don't worry.

27:34.153 --> 27:35.822
I'm leaving your
dad out of it.

27:37.757 --> 27:40.226
- What about your family?
- What about me?

27:40.259 --> 27:43.696
Why do I always have to keep
everybody else's secrets?

27:43.730 --> 27:47.867
Besides, I know what it's like
to be the last one to know.

27:49.769 --> 27:51.738
I'm telling my dad
after practice.

28:05.885 --> 28:07.820
[Kim] I'll be in the
viewing area, Payson.

28:07.854 --> 28:10.890
- Take your time.
I'm in no hurry.
- Thanks, Mom.

28:15.127 --> 28:16.128
Hey.

28:17.163 --> 28:18.865
I haven't had
a chance to say

28:18.898 --> 28:21.801
I'm sorry about
what happened to you.

28:21.834 --> 28:23.502
And I'm sure you
really mean that.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.138
Actually, I do.
Look, I know I'm a bitch,

28:26.172 --> 28:28.875
but psyching out
the competition
is just part of the game.

28:28.908 --> 28:31.744
- It wasn't for me.
- I know.

28:31.778 --> 28:34.013
That's why
I'm gonna miss you.
You were a challenge.

28:34.046 --> 28:37.850
Unlike Kaylie.
I don't even have to huff
or puff to blow her down.

28:37.884 --> 28:41.187
- Leave her alone.
- Not a problem.

28:41.220 --> 28:43.089
She's already
self-destructing.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.758
You may want to give
your friends a heads-up.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.126
Even if they could
get rid of Marty,

28:47.159 --> 28:50.229
the National Committee's
never gonna pick Sasha
to coach the team.

28:50.262 --> 28:54.500
- Why not?
- Well, isn't it obvious?

28:54.533 --> 28:57.003
No.

28:58.070 --> 28:59.806
Because of you.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.276
Payson, his star
gymnast broke her back

29:04.310 --> 29:06.512
in front of the whole world.

29:06.545 --> 29:09.949
They could never pick
Sasha after that.

29:09.982 --> 29:12.952
- [Kim] Hey, Alex.
- Kim.

29:14.954 --> 29:17.924
You must be
very proud of Kaylie.

29:17.957 --> 29:19.758
I am.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.029
But I don't know how
you gym moms do it.

29:23.062 --> 29:25.331
Sitting behind this glass
with nothing to do all day.

29:25.364 --> 29:27.800
We're not doing nothing.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.101
We're supporting our kids.

29:30.069 --> 29:32.538
Yeah, right,
but, you know...

29:32.571 --> 29:33.940
...I used to
manage this place.

29:33.973 --> 29:36.943
- Me, too.
- Of course.

29:36.976 --> 29:39.578
- [laughing]
- Are you coming back?

29:39.611 --> 29:42.314
I'd like to.
But Payson needs me.

29:42.348 --> 29:44.817
With physical therapy and
everything she's going through,

29:44.851 --> 29:46.853
my place is
with Payson right now.

29:48.855 --> 29:50.857
I don't know
where my place is anymore.

29:52.391 --> 29:55.061
Kaylie fired me
as her manager.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.866
Well, she didn't
fire you as her dad.

30:00.933 --> 30:03.035
If you're not sure
where your place is,

30:03.069 --> 30:05.037
maybe it's at home.

30:05.071 --> 30:07.339
You think I've
neglected my family?

30:07.373 --> 30:10.843
I think it's easy
to take things for granted.

30:10.877 --> 30:14.146
Our daughter lost her dream

30:14.180 --> 30:15.414
in the blink of an eye.

30:18.050 --> 30:19.818
But she still has us.

30:22.088 --> 30:26.592
And it's times
like these you realize
you can lose everything,

30:26.625 --> 30:29.128
but if you still
have your family,

30:29.161 --> 30:31.197
you've got the thing
that matters most.

30:36.002 --> 30:37.436
Hm...

30:45.377 --> 30:48.380
- Why didn't you tell me
that it's my fault?
- Excuse me?

30:48.414 --> 30:51.417
They didn't pick you
to be the National coach
because I broke my back.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.886
It's more complex than that.

30:53.920 --> 30:56.055
They have no right
to hold you responsible!

30:56.088 --> 30:57.423
Actually, they
have every right.

30:57.456 --> 31:00.626
You didn't know!
I lied about how
much pain I was in.

31:00.659 --> 31:04.130
Of course you did.
Every gymnast
competes in pain.

31:04.163 --> 31:06.398
The more you want it,
the more you're
willing to endure.

31:06.432 --> 31:09.435
And I've never seen
anyone who wanted it
more than you, Payson.

31:10.937 --> 31:12.905
And that's why
I should have known.

31:12.939 --> 31:15.307
I am the only one
responsible for my injury.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.476
- I'm gonna go
tell the committee.
- Payson.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.048
It won't matter.

31:22.081 --> 31:25.151
Please, sit down.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.920
There was another girl.

31:27.954 --> 31:31.390
It was while I was
still coaching in Romania.

31:31.423 --> 31:34.193
Her name was Amelia.

31:34.226 --> 31:36.062
She was 14.

31:36.095 --> 31:39.431
She, uh... She took
a fall off the bars,

31:39.465 --> 31:42.034
and hit her head
pretty hard.

31:42.068 --> 31:44.270
But she got straight up
and wanted to go again.

31:44.303 --> 31:48.274
She was actually
a lot like you.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.945
I made her sit out
the rest of practice.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.714
And she seemed fine so I told
her parents it was their call

31:55.747 --> 31:58.184
whether to take her to
the doctor's or take her home.

31:58.217 --> 32:01.020
And... they took her home.

32:04.190 --> 32:08.260
And... an hour later,
she was dead.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.131
How could you have known?

32:12.164 --> 32:14.400
I should have insisted
that she go to the hospital.

32:14.433 --> 32:18.504
- You told her parents.
- It was a fatal
lack of judgment,

32:18.537 --> 32:20.506
and I will never
forgive myself.

32:23.542 --> 32:27.413
I'll never forgive myself
for costing you this job.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.482
I never realized my injury
could hurt anybody but me.

32:30.516 --> 32:35.121
- Payson, don't.
- Isn't there
something I can do?

32:35.154 --> 32:39.391
Yeah. You can convince the
girls to stop this foolishness

32:39.425 --> 32:44.063
and to support Marty
before they're all kicked
off the National Team.

32:44.096 --> 32:46.265
- Why me?
- Because like it or not,

32:46.298 --> 32:48.734
they listen to you.
You're a leader.

32:48.767 --> 32:52.238
And one thing a leader
does well is coach others.

32:54.773 --> 32:57.243
What if I don't want
to be a leader?

32:57.276 --> 33:01.047
I'm not on the team.
I can never do gymnastics again.

33:01.080 --> 33:04.416
Why is it my job
to coach them?
It's not my job!

33:04.450 --> 33:06.485
No.

33:06.518 --> 33:09.055
It's not your job,

33:09.088 --> 33:11.023
but maybe it's your calling.

33:28.074 --> 33:30.209
Dad?

33:30.242 --> 33:31.443
Can I talk to you?

33:31.477 --> 33:35.281
Of course. Come, sit with me.

33:40.352 --> 33:42.388
What are you doing?

33:42.421 --> 33:45.057
Have you ever felt
like I neglected you?

33:45.091 --> 33:48.560
Not as a gymnast,
but as a daughter.

33:48.594 --> 33:52.831
- Dad...
- I never thought that I was
one of those ambitious dads

33:52.864 --> 33:57.369
pushing their kids
for their own glory
because I was your manager.

33:58.204 --> 34:00.439
What a bunch of BS.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.208
I was worse.

34:02.241 --> 34:05.511
I was a former athlete trying
to pin his unfulfilled dreams

34:05.544 --> 34:10.116
on his very beautiful,
very talented little girl.

34:10.149 --> 34:12.218
- I'm glad you fired me.
- Dad...

34:12.251 --> 34:15.254
I mean it. I haven't
been a great father.

34:15.287 --> 34:19.358
And I don't want to be
one of those guys who doesn't
realize what he's got...

34:19.391 --> 34:21.260
...until it's gone.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.532
If I lost you all...

34:29.501 --> 34:31.637
...I'd lose everything.

34:35.141 --> 34:37.476
You won't lose me, Dad.

34:37.509 --> 34:39.411
Not ever.

34:39.445 --> 34:41.547
I promise.

34:45.251 --> 34:47.286
[chuckles] Look at that.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.660
And that's time.

34:56.695 --> 34:59.531
I never minded algebra so much,

34:59.565 --> 35:02.868
but geometry,
ugh, that was a bear.

35:02.901 --> 35:05.204
Can't wait.

35:05.237 --> 35:08.540
Emily, if you
don't mind me asking,

35:08.574 --> 35:12.311
I noticed all the other girls
are wearing their
National Team jackets.

35:14.380 --> 35:17.549
My mother washed mine
with her hot pink mini-skirt,

35:17.583 --> 35:22.488
or halter top or baby dolls.
It's her new signature color.

35:22.521 --> 35:27.326
Anyways, she ruined it and we
can't afford to buy another one.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.595
I'm sure it was an accident.

35:30.662 --> 35:33.432
I'm sure it was.

35:33.465 --> 35:37.569
I just wish she would stay out
of anything gymnastics related.

35:37.603 --> 35:40.306
Whenever she tries to help out,
it always seems to backfire.

35:40.339 --> 35:43.442
Well, she got you
into The Rock, didn't she?

35:43.475 --> 35:45.277
She didn't have anything
to do with it.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.712
Marty found me
at the Y in Fresno.

35:46.745 --> 35:50.249
Huh.

35:50.282 --> 35:55.621
You know, I was cleaning up some
old files and I found something
I thought you might want.

35:59.325 --> 36:03.495
There must be at least three
dozen cards and letters in there

36:03.529 --> 36:07.366
from your mother begging
Marty to come see you.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.514
"One golden ticket

36:22.548 --> 36:27.753
to see the golden girl
at the Fresno Y who
will blow your socks off.

36:27.786 --> 36:31.623
Please, please, please come.
You won't be sorry."

36:47.606 --> 36:52.244
Hi, honey. I'm dying
your jacket in the bathroom.

36:52.278 --> 36:53.512
Thank you.

36:53.545 --> 36:55.614
Well, I don't know
if it's gonna work yet.

36:55.647 --> 36:58.284
For being my mom.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.288
I love you.

37:04.022 --> 37:07.326
Oh! I love you, too, honey.

37:16.802 --> 37:19.638
[camera shutter clicking]

37:23.309 --> 37:25.677
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:25.711 --> 37:29.014
Your girls aren't here yet.

37:29.047 --> 37:31.683
- I'd hate to see them
make a big mistake.
- Yeah, thank you.

37:31.717 --> 37:35.487
Don't worry.
I have a feeling they won't.

37:35.521 --> 37:39.658
All right, so
if we get in that picture,

37:39.691 --> 37:43.695
- it means Marty wins.
- And his little brat,
Kelly Parker.

37:43.729 --> 37:46.598
So I guess you
didn't tell your dad
about your mom and Marty.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.834
I couldn't.

37:48.867 --> 37:52.338
I don't know
what else we can do.

37:52.371 --> 37:53.605
[Payson] I do.

37:56.875 --> 37:59.778
You're gonna go out there
and take the
National Team picture

37:59.811 --> 38:02.348
like the professionals you are.

38:02.381 --> 38:04.316
I thought we were
on our own.

38:04.350 --> 38:07.319
You didn't want any part
of The Rock drama.

38:07.353 --> 38:11.623
Turns out,
I am the drama.

38:13.459 --> 38:15.694
It's my fault Sasha
wasn't picked to be
the National Team coach.

38:15.727 --> 38:18.330
- Your fault?
- Why?

38:18.364 --> 38:21.700
His top gymnast broke
her back on TV in front
of the whole world.

38:21.733 --> 38:24.736
They're not gonna entrust him
to coach the National Team.

38:24.770 --> 38:27.673
- That wasn't Sasha's fault.
- It doesn't matter.

38:27.706 --> 38:31.877
The point is, even if
you could get rid of Marty,
you're not gonna get Sasha.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.580
And at least you know Marty.

38:34.613 --> 38:38.550
And you know
he's a good coach.

38:38.584 --> 38:40.819
Look, you don't
always get what you want.

38:40.852 --> 38:43.822
Or what you
think you deserve.

38:43.855 --> 38:47.493
But you're
on the National Team.

38:49.595 --> 38:52.798
Do you guys know what
I would give to be you?

38:52.831 --> 38:56.702
Who cares who the coach is?

38:56.735 --> 38:58.637
This is about you

38:58.670 --> 39:01.740
and what you've worked
your entire life to achieve.

39:03.809 --> 39:06.645
You guys know you do not
deserve to go to London.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.847
And you know you
haven't been your best.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.749
How does that feel?

39:13.852 --> 39:19.525
Go out there and be
the athletes I've spent
my career training with.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.560
The ones who
respect their coach,

39:21.593 --> 39:24.630
respect themselves
and respect their club.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.800
Let's go be
the champions that we are,

39:28.834 --> 39:31.603
and promise to let
nothing stop us.

39:31.637 --> 39:34.473
So when you say "us,"

39:34.506 --> 39:37.609
does that mean you're
gonna coach after all?

39:39.845 --> 39:43.582
It means we're still
going to the Olympics.

39:43.615 --> 39:46.685
Maybe not exactly
like we planned it,

39:46.718 --> 39:48.587
but we'll get there.

39:51.623 --> 39:54.526
- Together.
- [all laugh]

39:59.665 --> 40:00.999
OK, do we have everyone?

40:06.672 --> 40:09.608
Ladies, it's about time.

40:09.641 --> 40:10.842
- Sorry, coach.
- Sorry, coach.

40:10.876 --> 40:11.877
Sorry, coach.

40:13.812 --> 40:15.714
[Marty] Emily,
where's your team jacket?

40:15.747 --> 40:17.716
- [Chloe] Oh! It's right here!
- Um...

40:17.749 --> 40:19.985
Sorry! Those
darn dry cleaners!

40:20.018 --> 40:21.853
See, honey?
It's just like new.

40:21.887 --> 40:24.656
Oh!

40:24.690 --> 40:26.858
You know, you keep
hugging me like that,

40:26.892 --> 40:31.463
I'm gonna put out
a missing persons report
on my daughter Emily Kmetko.

40:31.497 --> 40:32.764
Let's go.

40:34.600 --> 40:37.603
- Emily, I got
your quiz results.
- Oh! Open it!

40:37.636 --> 40:40.005
Why ruin
a perfectly good day?

40:42.641 --> 40:46.011
As good as new
because it is new.
Thank you.

40:46.044 --> 40:50.882
I catered to the National
Committee's every whim
all week. They owed me.

40:50.916 --> 40:53.719
* I'm so uptight

40:53.752 --> 40:57.489
* I got two hands
With all my might... *

40:57.523 --> 40:59.991
Let's get the National
Champ in at center, please.

41:00.025 --> 41:03.662
* But you can only have one

41:03.695 --> 41:08.567
* We're in service
by starlight *

41:08.600 --> 41:11.703
Enjoy your 15 minutes.
If it even lasts that long.

41:11.737 --> 41:15.541
* All right, all right

41:19.310 --> 41:22.648
* All right, all right *

41:23.949 --> 41:28.053
I'm proud of you, showing up
for your friends like this.

41:28.086 --> 41:30.656
You should be in that photo.

41:30.689 --> 41:33.725
I will be. Next year.

41:33.759 --> 41:39.064
- As a coach?
- As the new National Champion.

41:39.097 --> 41:41.700
OK, in one, two, three.

41:50.842 --> 41:53.779
Hey. Any word
on that algebra test?

41:55.847 --> 41:56.982
I can't look.

41:59.585 --> 42:03.622
Yeah. We can't
all get straight A's.

42:03.655 --> 42:06.925
Unless... we are Emily Kmetko!

42:06.958 --> 42:09.695
Girl genius,
flippity-flop artist.

42:09.728 --> 42:12.530
Oh, my God!
I can't believe it!
Thank you!

42:16.602 --> 42:18.970
[phone rings]

42:19.004 --> 42:23.609
- Um, I should...
- [phone ringing]

42:23.642 --> 42:25.310
Hello. Pizza Shack,
how can I help you?

42:25.343 --> 42:28.614
Hi! [laughs]

42:28.647 --> 42:31.817
How's LA? Tell me everything.

42:44.162 --> 42:45.697
Razor says hi.

42:48.634 --> 42:50.001
No, it's fine.

42:51.637 --> 42:53.939
Guess what?
I got an A on my algebra test.

42:59.811 --> 43:02.648
Yeah. I miss you, too.
