00:10.218 --> 00:12.470
[cheeping]

00:12.929 --> 00:14.723
-Mom!
-[cheeps]

00:15.473 --> 00:16.850
Mom! Dad's here!

00:17.851 --> 00:18.685
[Jen] Huh?

00:19.102 --> 00:21.604
-Wait. What did you just say?
-Dad came to visit me again.

00:21.688 --> 00:24.274
Okay. Honey, I'm not really following you.

00:24.607 --> 00:26.735
I see a little bird.

00:26.943 --> 00:29.279
You know how Dad used to come in
and wake me up for school,

00:29.612 --> 00:30.488
when he was...

00:31.573 --> 00:33.199
-You know.
-Mm-hm.

00:33.324 --> 00:36.327
Now the bird started coming to my window
every morning. Just like Dad.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.204
Oh, Boop.

00:38.538 --> 00:40.999
Hey. Breakfast is almost ready.
It's a frittata.

00:42.292 --> 00:46.046
[whispering] Henry thinks that the bird
is his dead father.

00:47.505 --> 00:48.840
That's where we're at right now.

00:48.923 --> 00:50.133
[cheeps]

00:50.550 --> 00:52.135
Oh, maybe it <i>is </i>him.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.220
I know you're into some woo-woo stuff,

00:54.304 --> 00:56.181
but you don't really think that
that's his dad?

00:56.264 --> 00:59.642
I don't know. I mean, I do believe
the spirits of our loved ones

00:59.726 --> 01:01.770
can find a way to come back to us.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.106
-Okay.
-Look at him.

01:05.482 --> 01:07.859
Come on, what's the harm? He's so happy.

01:08.610 --> 01:09.819
-[cheeps]
-[Jen] I guess.

01:10.695 --> 01:11.738
[cheeps]

01:18.203 --> 01:20.288
-[cheep]
-[birds cawing]

01:23.917 --> 01:26.294
[Wayne] Before we get started, I wanna say

01:26.377 --> 01:29.506
I am happy to see Jen and Judy
here together.

01:29.589 --> 01:30.590
What a nice surprise.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.258
-Thank you.
-Surprise!

01:32.342 --> 01:33.843
Last time, you was really pissed at her.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.263
I was actually scared for you.

01:37.680 --> 01:39.599
All right, you know what, guys?
I have an idea.

01:39.891 --> 01:40.934
Let's talk about death.

01:41.226 --> 01:42.185
[Wayne] Yes, please.

01:42.435 --> 01:43.686
And remember our rule, everyone.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.605
You only have to share
what you wanna share.

01:46.564 --> 01:49.901
I would like to share
that I'm really grateful to Jen

01:50.276 --> 01:52.779
for her friendship and for so much more.

01:53.029 --> 01:53.863
So...

01:54.405 --> 01:58.118
That's wonderful. It just goes to show
that through all of this pain and tragedy,

01:58.201 --> 01:59.452
good things can happen.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.664
-Anyone else?
-[Jen] I'll go.

02:03.957 --> 02:08.753
My son has started talking
to a bird that he thinks is his dead dad.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.631
Which, I understand, is not crazy.

02:12.006 --> 02:12.841
So, thank you.

02:13.424 --> 02:14.509
I think it's sweet.

02:14.592 --> 02:16.761
And who knows? Right?

02:17.303 --> 02:19.889
Come on. I mean, I think I know, but...

02:21.057 --> 02:22.976
it is... it is sweet.

02:23.726 --> 02:24.769
I mean, I...

02:25.937 --> 02:28.773
I want him to, you know,
think what he needs to think

02:28.857 --> 02:32.902
to feel better, but it just doesn't
make <i>me </i>feel any better.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.614
I'm ready to not be
reminded of Ted every day,

02:36.698 --> 02:39.701
and everywhere I look,
and every conversation that I have...

02:39.784 --> 02:42.036
I'm really, really tired
of talking about it.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.038
You brought it up.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.709
[Wayne] Jen, I know
it feels relentless now, but...

02:48.293 --> 02:50.295
maybe those reminders
are there for a reason.

02:50.503 --> 02:52.172
So we're forced to face our grief.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.257
Oh... I'm facing it.

02:56.301 --> 02:57.635
It's his birthday tomorrow.

02:59.095 --> 02:59.929
It is?

03:00.388 --> 03:01.347
Fiftieth.

03:02.932 --> 03:06.936
Jen... I think you should celebrate
Ted's birthday.

03:07.395 --> 03:08.438
I don't.

03:09.147 --> 03:12.483
I'm not gonna sing
happy birthday to a dead man.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.027
That's weird.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.905
[Wayne] Maybe you wanna do something
to memorialize Ted.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.324
On the first birthday after my aunt died,

03:19.407 --> 03:23.953
my family wrote messages to my aunt of all
the things they never got a chance to say.

03:24.412 --> 03:27.207
And they put these messages
inside balloons, and then...

03:27.707 --> 03:29.209
we released them to heaven.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.502
-[laughing] Absolutely not.
-I love that.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.505
[Christopher] <i>Look around, enjoy.</i>

03:35.506 --> 03:38.843
Hi. You see the couple over there
with matching sweaters?

03:39.260 --> 03:41.679
Oh, yeah. Mr. and Mrs. Talbots.

03:41.804 --> 03:44.432
Verbal offer, 50 over asking.
She loves it.

03:44.515 --> 03:47.143
And he cheated on her,
so his opinion doesn't matter.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.020
Ooh!

03:49.395 --> 03:51.314
Is that Jen the Closer I see?

03:51.731 --> 03:53.274
-I missed her.
-Me too.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.526
-It's nice to focus on something else.
-Right.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.527
[door opens]

04:00.448 --> 04:01.991
-Uh-oh.
-Oh, God.

04:02.116 --> 04:03.660
The Queen has arrived.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.246
Fan out, team.
I want our own pictures of everything.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.705
Angelica, closets.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.875
-[Jen] Not it.
-You'll be talking to her...

04:10.959 --> 04:13.253
-I said "not it." You didn't hear me.
-I don't think you said that.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.254
I said "not it" first.

04:14.337 --> 04:16.756
You can talk to her in a way
that no one else can.

04:16.839 --> 04:20.301
When I'm talking to her, I'm imagining
stabbing her in the fucking throat.

04:20.385 --> 04:22.679
-Enjoy. She's right behind you.
-I said "not..." I hate you.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.266
Hi, Lorna.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.435
Hi. Was that Christopher?
He's paler than I remember.

04:29.686 --> 04:32.814
-Yeah.
-So, this is a decent listing for you.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.023
Good neighborhood.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.942
-Yeah.
-Though I hear the schools are slipping.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.819
Really? I hadn't heard that.

04:37.986 --> 04:42.073
Well, you know me. Eyes and ears
everywhere, my little spies.

04:42.865 --> 04:45.368
-Is the seller motivated?
-Yes, he is.

04:45.451 --> 04:47.745
I think we're gonna have
a competitive situation.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.539
Blowing up on Zillow...

04:50.164 --> 04:51.958
Well, you priced it too low.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.169
Are we done?

04:56.671 --> 05:00.216
We should probably talk about
Ted's birthday tomorrow.

05:01.092 --> 05:03.136
Must be hard on you. I'm a wreck.

05:04.095 --> 05:05.013
Actually, I'm okay.

05:06.764 --> 05:09.434
You've always been able
to compartmentalize. I envy that.

05:10.059 --> 05:12.520
The floors are nice.
But of course I can't.

05:13.187 --> 05:14.480
Ted was my only son.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.982
Ted was my only husband.

05:16.566 --> 05:17.650
Oh, I know.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.485
But you can always remarry.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.488
I'm his mother. I can't replace him.

05:24.782 --> 05:27.660
You know what? You should really
look at the master bathroom.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.370
It is beautifully appointed.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.164
His and hers sinks?

05:31.914 --> 05:33.124
You better fucking believe it.

05:33.374 --> 05:34.250
Hmm.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.003
Oh...

05:37.628 --> 05:38.755
-One more thing.
-Yup?

05:38.921 --> 05:42.008
I'm planning a small event
for Ted's birthday at my house.

05:42.091 --> 05:43.801
-No.
-Nothing elaborate.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.012
Just friends, work friends, acquaintances.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.180
I said no.

05:48.097 --> 05:50.058
-What do you mean, "no"?
-Because it...

05:51.434 --> 05:52.518
Because...

05:53.644 --> 05:58.316
I'm planning an event for Ted's birthday
at my house with the boys.

05:59.484 --> 06:00.610
What kind of event?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.196
A memorial.

06:04.864 --> 06:06.032
We're gonna, like...

06:09.077 --> 06:11.621
gonna write little messages
on pieces of paper, and then...

06:12.121 --> 06:15.416
put them into balloons, and, you know...

06:17.668 --> 06:19.045
float 'em up to the heavens.

06:19.379 --> 06:20.505
That's what we're doing.

06:21.672 --> 06:23.257
-I'll be there.
-Don't go out of your way.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.842
-See you then.
-Fuck!

06:26.719 --> 06:28.137
[Judy] Wow!

06:29.180 --> 06:30.807
Hey, this looks great.

06:31.474 --> 06:34.977
Agatha, I really have to compliment
your sense of perspective.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.813
I'm very good, right?

06:36.896 --> 06:38.314
-Yeah.
-[man] Where is it?

06:38.398 --> 06:39.315
You too.

06:39.732 --> 06:40.650
[man] Where is it?

06:42.860 --> 06:44.195
You gotta be kidding me.

06:44.821 --> 06:46.155
There's a piece missing!

06:46.239 --> 06:49.117
What? Here. I'll help you find it.
Don't get your blood pressure up.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.411
How disappointing it is
to work on a puzzle for a week

06:51.494 --> 06:54.080
and you end up
and the last piece is missing!

06:54.163 --> 06:56.416
I mean, this is gonna
stay with me for months.

06:57.166 --> 06:58.418
God Almighty!

06:59.085 --> 07:00.169
-Huh?
-I found it.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.880
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.383
-Yeah.
-Hi, Judy.

07:11.222 --> 07:12.056
Hi.

07:13.349 --> 07:14.725
Uh, I wanna talk.

07:15.977 --> 07:16.936
Hello, Abe.

07:17.019 --> 07:18.312
Hello, Steve.

07:18.604 --> 07:19.814
You asshole.

07:20.273 --> 07:21.107
Uh...

07:21.983 --> 07:23.901
Yeah, okay.

07:25.903 --> 07:26.821
Thought I couldn't get

07:26.904 --> 07:29.866
-within 100 yards of you?
-Judy, Judy... I spoke to Jen.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.826
Super cool chick, by the way.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.244
Uh...

07:33.786 --> 07:37.582
She said something that...
I don't know, it kind of...

07:38.666 --> 07:39.500
hit me.

07:40.126 --> 07:43.588
And it made me think I went a little
overboard about the restraining order.

07:43.671 --> 07:48.217
So, sorry, and I wanted to
let you know that I had it revoked.

07:50.219 --> 07:52.513
[whispers] She's his <i>wife.</i>

07:52.889 --> 07:53.848
Whose wife?

07:54.682 --> 07:56.350
The guy we hit.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.270
We hit a deer.

07:59.353 --> 08:02.231
-Well, the deer had a wife.
-Okay.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.527
And I befriended her, and I've been trying
to tell you, but you keep shutting me out.

08:06.611 --> 08:08.905
Why would you...
What the fuck are you thinking?

08:08.988 --> 08:11.115
-We ruined her life!
-Oh, Jesus, no.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.993
I made friends with her. We're friends.
And I'm helping her.

08:14.076 --> 08:15.495
It's the least I can do. Maybe...

08:15.578 --> 08:18.122
Maybe there could be something good
that comes out of this.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.124
Oh, my God.

08:20.875 --> 08:21.792
You <i>are </i>nuts.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.003
-Don't do that.
-Sorry.

08:24.086 --> 08:25.004
It's okay.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.841
Judy, you murdered her husband!

08:29.717 --> 08:34.222
You said it was manslaughter. And it was
an accident. And you were there too.

08:34.305 --> 08:37.099
So you thought it'd be a great idea
to invite her into both of our lives?

08:37.183 --> 08:38.392
She's selling my fucking house!

08:38.476 --> 08:40.853
Which I have a lot of feelings about
because that's <i>our </i>house.

08:40.937 --> 08:43.189
-We are so far past that right now!
-Don't yell at me.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.398
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

08:45.483 --> 08:46.984
Look, we had a plan. Right?

08:47.610 --> 08:49.946
We were gonna lock this away
and not bring it up again.

08:50.029 --> 08:52.698
No. <i>You </i>had a plan.
I wanted to tell the truth.

08:52.782 --> 08:53.783
[Abe] Judy!

08:54.408 --> 08:55.910
Is everything all right out there?

08:56.744 --> 08:58.829
Yeah, Abe, I'm fine, thanks.

08:59.288 --> 09:01.249
Well, you let me know if you need backup.

09:01.916 --> 09:04.418
-I got nothing to lose.
-I will.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.260
-Look, baby--
-Don't call me that.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.013
-Force of habit. Sorry.
-It's okay.

09:17.431 --> 09:18.432
[Steve sighs]

09:19.100 --> 09:19.976
Judy,

09:20.851 --> 09:22.228
we can't change the past.

09:23.604 --> 09:26.816
Now, I know this has been
really hard for you. I get it.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.735
But I promise you,
if you tell Jen what happened,

09:29.819 --> 09:32.738
you will only be making it worse
for her and for me.

09:33.406 --> 09:36.534
I know you don't want that. You don't want
to cause any more pain, do you?

09:37.785 --> 09:39.036
You don't know what I want.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.163
And I don't have to do your plan.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.625
-You know, you're the one who left me.
-Judy, don't be stupid.

09:45.501 --> 09:47.044
You're not my fiancé anymore.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.714
-You're not even my lawyer anymore.
-Judy, listen to me...

09:49.797 --> 09:51.132
[cell phone chimes]

09:51.716 --> 09:54.176
[gasps] Oh, look! It's my friend.

09:54.260 --> 09:56.053
-Okay. Judy?
-Sorry.

09:57.013 --> 09:57.930
Judy!

09:58.931 --> 10:00.182
[Judy] I'm at work.

10:01.976 --> 10:03.394
[growls]

10:04.020 --> 10:06.647
She just backed me into a corner.
I had no choice.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.984
God, there's a lot
of fucking piñatas in here.

10:10.318 --> 10:12.612
I'm surprised you opted
for the balloon release thing.

10:12.695 --> 10:15.197
-I thought that you said it was "woo-woo."
-It is.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.116
I'm repulsed by it, actually.

10:17.199 --> 10:20.161
But there was no way
I was gonna let Lorna take over.

10:20.244 --> 10:21.996
I mean, she is <i>awful.</i>

10:22.538 --> 10:25.416
She is one of the world's
great narcissists.

10:25.499 --> 10:28.169
-Oh, she's internationally recognized?
-Yes.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.296
Oh, you should've seen her
at Ted's funeral.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.423
It was her finest performance.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.135
[wailing dramatically]  My son!

10:36.802 --> 10:38.763
My baby boy!

10:39.055 --> 10:40.806
My teddy bear!

10:41.140 --> 10:42.725
[howls]

10:47.688 --> 10:49.482
[Jen] He was dreading turning 50.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.109
God, he would've hated all this shit.

10:56.572 --> 10:58.407
I wish I could bring him back for you.

10:59.909 --> 11:01.535
I know, but you can't.

11:02.578 --> 11:04.372
Unless you know something
that I don't know.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.793
Why don't I take over?

11:09.543 --> 11:11.337
No, Judy. I decided to do this.
I have to--

11:11.420 --> 11:13.506
No. Please. Come on.

11:13.923 --> 11:15.925
-[sighs]
-Let me. I can whip something up.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.426
It's totally in my wheelhouse.

11:17.635 --> 11:20.304
Ew! I was in until you said "wheelhouse."

11:20.471 --> 11:21.889
Stop it. Come on.

11:22.515 --> 11:23.391
Really?

11:23.808 --> 11:26.394
Because I don't know if you can tell,
but this store is, like,

11:26.644 --> 11:28.437
depressing the shit out of me.

11:28.646 --> 11:30.022
I got it. I swear.

11:30.272 --> 11:33.067
Lorna is gonna love it so much,
she's gonna die.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.985
Mmm! You promise?

11:37.655 --> 11:38.739
[sighs]

11:39.240 --> 11:40.825
[Jen] Off the computer, please.

11:42.910 --> 11:43.994
Yo, bro!

11:44.078 --> 11:45.830
-Ow!
-That did not hurt.

11:46.163 --> 11:49.041
Please just turn it off, okay?
Your grandmother is gonna be here soon.

11:49.125 --> 11:50.084
I don't want to.

11:50.376 --> 11:52.378
I'm sorry.
What words did you just say to me?

11:53.963 --> 11:55.715
I don't wanna do this memorial thing.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.218
Okay. Well, you know what?
Neither do I, but we're still doing it.

11:59.301 --> 12:00.636
Okay. Can I go now?

12:00.720 --> 12:03.597
'Cause I'm in the middle of a campaign
and I'm playing with other people.

12:03.931 --> 12:05.516
-What people?
-Game friends.

12:05.599 --> 12:08.853
<i>Wrath of Hades </i>is multiplayer
and we're getting slaughtered.

12:09.186 --> 12:10.938
Oh. That sounds fun.

12:11.480 --> 12:12.732
Dad thought it was fun.

12:15.359 --> 12:16.694
And he used to play with me.

12:18.529 --> 12:19.947
Of course he played with you.

12:20.448 --> 12:23.617
Yeah. His... laptop's right there.

12:23.701 --> 12:27.538
If you want, you could give it a try or...
You probably wouldn't get it.

12:28.414 --> 12:29.874
We both know I would not.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.375
-Yeah.
-[Henry] Mom!

12:31.459 --> 12:35.171
You have to come see the backyard.
Oh, my gosh. Dad is gonna love this!

12:39.383 --> 12:40.551
Okay, let's do this.

12:47.141 --> 12:49.685
Judy, seriously?

12:50.394 --> 12:51.312
Is it okay?

12:51.395 --> 12:54.440
No. It's ridiculous, in the best way.

12:55.065 --> 12:55.983
Thank you.

12:58.736 --> 12:59.904
Charlie, there's candy.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.491
I think it's good we're doing this.

13:04.074 --> 13:06.285
You know?
I think it'll be good for the boys.

13:06.535 --> 13:08.037
I think it'll be good for everyone.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.917
Look who I found
poking around outside your house.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.251
[Lorna] I wasn't poking.

13:14.543 --> 13:17.797
I noticed some dead spots on your lawn.
You need a gardener, Jennifer.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.132
-I'll send Manuel over.
-No, I'm good.

13:20.216 --> 13:23.052
We just got a third offer
on Steve's house, over asking.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.970
That's because you priced it too low.

13:25.054 --> 13:27.598
You could just say congratulations,
you know?

13:27.681 --> 13:29.141
Congratulations.

13:32.436 --> 13:37.399
Jennifer, I must compliment you
on your decorations. They're <i>muy</i> tasteful.

13:37.483 --> 13:38.484
Oh, well.

13:38.776 --> 13:39.693
Gracias.

13:39.777 --> 13:42.863
Uh, I actually cannot take credit
for any of this. It's...

13:43.197 --> 13:44.532
Decorations are all Judy.

13:44.990 --> 13:49.870
-Oh. You hire well. That's also a skill.
-Jesus Christ, Lorna. I didn't hire her.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.331
She isn't your house girl?

13:52.706 --> 13:53.749
[sighs]

13:53.833 --> 13:56.794
No. Judy is a friend of mine
who is living with us.

13:56.877 --> 13:58.003
Why didn't I know about this?

13:58.254 --> 14:00.923
You know, Judy?
Can we get this balloon thing

14:01.006 --> 14:02.466
-going before I...
-[Judy] Oh, yeah.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.344
-Come on, everybody...
-...stab this fucking bitch in the twat.

14:05.678 --> 14:09.682
So, the idea is you write down something

14:09.765 --> 14:14.144
that you wish you'd gotten the chance
to say to Ted, or your dad,

14:14.854 --> 14:17.565
when he was still here.
Something you'd like him to know.

14:17.982 --> 14:21.277
And we'll release them
to his spirit in the sky.

14:21.360 --> 14:22.236
[scoffs]

14:23.737 --> 14:26.574
When you're ready,
you roll up your message...

14:28.284 --> 14:30.494
and work it into the balloon's hole.

14:30.578 --> 14:31.954
-[sniggers]
-[Jen whacks his leg]

14:32.329 --> 14:34.665
-Okay.
-I don't know how I'm supposed to fit

14:35.082 --> 14:38.669
a lifetime of feeling
onto one tiny piece of paper.

14:41.171 --> 14:44.091
-Mommy, aren't you gonna write one?
-Yes, of course, babe.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.261
Oh, Judy, you have to write one too.

14:47.761 --> 14:50.222
And say what? She never met him.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.766
[Lorna wailing] <i>My son!</i>

14:53.183 --> 14:55.269
My baby boy!

14:55.394 --> 14:57.438
My teddy bear!

14:57.605 --> 14:59.148
[howls]

15:16.206 --> 15:17.291
[Jen] You just...

15:35.225 --> 15:36.518
[sniveling]

15:40.564 --> 15:42.024
[sobbing]

16:24.233 --> 16:25.275
[sniffs]

16:35.828 --> 16:37.121
Oh! God.

16:38.205 --> 16:39.331
Oh, hi.

16:40.457 --> 16:41.834
You're very pretty.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.836
Oh, thank you.

16:45.170 --> 16:47.339
You're a very curious
kind of person, aren't you?

16:48.590 --> 16:49.758
Where'd she find you?

16:51.885 --> 16:56.098
Uh... At a grief support group thing.
Um...

16:57.433 --> 16:58.684
Friends of Heaven.

16:59.018 --> 16:59.852
I see.

17:00.602 --> 17:02.354
And you were homeless at the time?

17:03.564 --> 17:06.108
-Come again?
-Jennifer told me you were living with her

17:06.191 --> 17:07.735
and the boys. Seems very quick.

17:09.236 --> 17:12.406
So, I assumed you must have been...
in need.

17:16.368 --> 17:19.830
Jen's just a very generous person.

17:30.716 --> 17:32.051
Is there anything else?

17:32.760 --> 17:33.677
Or...

17:34.887 --> 17:36.138
do you want a glass of wine?

17:36.221 --> 17:40.309
You know, Ted was a musician.
Naturally gifted.

17:40.392 --> 17:43.312
But his true job
was as a stay-at-home father.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.272
He did the majority of the parenting.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.275
Mothering never came naturally
to Jennifer.

17:49.651 --> 17:50.694
That's not true.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.362
Jen is a wonderful mother.

17:53.697 --> 17:54.531
Well...

17:55.491 --> 17:56.992
now who's being generous?

18:01.789 --> 18:03.582
Would you mind helping me with something?

18:05.000 --> 18:05.834
Sure.

18:11.840 --> 18:16.011
[all] <i>♪ Happy birthday to Ted ♪</i>

18:16.637 --> 18:20.599
<i>♪ Happy birthday to Ted ♪</i>

18:21.642 --> 18:25.687
<i>♪ Happy birthday,  dear Ted ♪</i>

18:26.230 --> 18:30.067
<i>♪ Happy birthday to Ted ♪</i>

18:30.234 --> 18:33.320
Wow. Lorna, I mean,
this cake is wonderfully specific.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.865
Mmm. Well, it's Teddy's
christening portrait.

18:37.282 --> 18:40.035
I have a client who creates them.
She's phenomenal.

18:40.202 --> 18:41.912
-Should we do the balloons now?
-[Judy] Yeah.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.164
What do you--
Like, one at a time or...?

18:44.248 --> 18:45.958
I think we do them all at once

18:46.041 --> 18:50.170
and then we have a quiet moment
of reflection as they drift away.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.922
-I could say a prayer.
-No.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.552
-Oh... Fine.
-Yeah?

18:56.635 --> 18:57.636
Yeah. Fine.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.388
Just hold my hand.

19:01.014 --> 19:02.516
Oh, we're holding? All right.

19:04.810 --> 19:08.689
Heavenly Father, you showed us
where two or more are gathered,

19:08.981 --> 19:10.357
you are always with us.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.902
We gather here today to celebrate Ted.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.071
[knocking]

19:16.155 --> 19:16.989
[woman] Hello?

19:18.115 --> 19:20.826
Sorry to interrupt the party.
We rang the doorbell.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.787
-Mrs. Harding, can we have a word?
-Oh, yeah.

19:27.958 --> 19:28.792
Hi.

19:29.001 --> 19:30.210
Did you find something?

19:30.294 --> 19:31.879
Okay. I have been here before. I--

19:31.962 --> 19:33.755
Is this about my son?

19:34.173 --> 19:36.425
Did you find the lunatic
who was driving the car?

19:39.595 --> 19:41.638
-No, ma'am.
-[female officer] We should talk inside.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.683
This is about the car
you called me about the other day.

19:45.726 --> 19:46.685
What about it?

19:47.436 --> 19:50.022
-Someone took a golf club to it.
-Did they?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.692
Obviously, it's a coincidence
that you called, let's go with

19:53.817 --> 19:57.196
"screaming at me," about the exact
same car right before it was--

19:57.279 --> 19:59.531
You know what? I'm so...
Gosh. I'm so sorry.

19:59.948 --> 20:02.492
Uh... It's just
this is not really a great time.

20:02.951 --> 20:03.827
Just, we're...

20:03.911 --> 20:07.539
We're having a birthday party
for my dead husband, so...

20:07.748 --> 20:09.249
Really nice you're doing something.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.502
Mrs. Harding,
I have a heavily vandalized car.

20:12.586 --> 20:14.588
Although I have a hunch,
I need to know who--

20:14.671 --> 20:17.841
You know what I need to know?
I need to know who killed my husband.

20:18.675 --> 20:21.470
All right? So what?
So some car gets fucked up,

20:21.553 --> 20:23.013
-and you come after me?
-Language.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.514
-That's not fair.
-Fair?

20:24.598 --> 20:28.060
Lady, there is a murderer on the loose
and you guys have done nothing!

20:28.602 --> 20:29.603
You wanna talk about fair?

20:29.686 --> 20:33.148
I wanna talk about where you were
two nights ago. It's Detective, not lady.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.484
-[Jen] Oh, God. So, you come here
-[heartbeat]

20:35.567 --> 20:38.528
because some dickhead
lost his windshield, Detective?

20:38.946 --> 20:40.489
Well, I lost my husband.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.574
-Just tell me who--
-You tell me.

20:42.950 --> 20:43.784
Who did it?

20:44.826 --> 20:45.869
Who did it?

20:46.536 --> 20:47.496
Who did it?

20:50.040 --> 20:50.958
I did it.

20:55.712 --> 20:56.672
It was me.

20:59.549 --> 21:01.093
I destroyed that Corvette.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.305
I saw the guy speeding, and he could've
hurt someone and then Jen was so upset.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.766
So, I went out and I found that car

21:08.058 --> 21:09.893
all by myself, and I just...

21:11.645 --> 21:12.771
went nuts on it.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.403
-[male officer] All right.
-She went nuts.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.616
-Hey. I'll be right behind you, okay?
-No. Stay.

21:24.700 --> 21:26.618
I'm not gonna let you sit
in some police station.

21:26.702 --> 21:29.830
I have a lawyer, I'll be fine.
Please, go do the balloons.

21:29.913 --> 21:31.832
I'm okay. Thank you.

21:33.667 --> 21:36.086
-[male officer] Watch your step.
-[Judy] This is a nice car.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.717
-Are you okay?
-I will be. Give me this. Thank you.

21:42.634 --> 21:45.637
You invited a violent criminal
into your home.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.055
[Jen] She's not a criminal, Lorna.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.766
[Lorna]
She's a confessed violent criminal,

21:49.850 --> 21:52.394
living under your roof
with my grandchildren.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.647
She actually lives in the guesthouse,
so technically she lives under Ted's roof.

21:55.939 --> 21:58.025
-And what would Ted say?
-I don't know, Lorna.

21:58.108 --> 22:02.154
I can't ask him that question,
but my friend is not a criminal.

22:02.529 --> 22:03.363
Okay?

22:04.114 --> 22:05.949
She's the only person
who has been here for me.

22:06.033 --> 22:10.203
The only person that doesn't make me
feel like I am failing at everything,

22:10.579 --> 22:11.830
including being a widow.

22:12.873 --> 22:15.625
She cares about me.
She cares about the boys.

22:15.959 --> 22:19.588
And so what? So she...
she smashed up a car.

22:20.172 --> 22:22.841
-You know what? Sometimes you just snap!
-[Lorna gasps]

22:22.924 --> 22:25.093
-Okay. Wow.
-How dare you!

22:28.388 --> 22:29.389
Hey, boys?

22:30.098 --> 22:32.142
Get in here and punch that cake.
It's really fun.

22:32.225 --> 22:33.852
-Are you sure?
-I'm sure.

22:33.935 --> 22:35.437
I want you to come destroy the cake.

22:35.520 --> 22:38.440
-I don't wanna punch the cake.
-That's my sweet boy.

22:38.857 --> 22:40.025
I want Judy to come back.

22:40.108 --> 22:42.235
You know what?
Judy would want you to punch the cake.

22:42.444 --> 22:44.738
Come on. Get in here. Let's do this.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.658
-There you go, get in there.
-Oh, wow.

22:48.742 --> 22:49.826
Yeah. Beat it up.

22:51.703 --> 22:52.996
[kids laugh]

22:53.872 --> 22:56.792
Of all the days,
you pick this one to hurt me?

22:57.250 --> 22:58.085
[Jen] You know what?

22:58.668 --> 23:01.004
Lighten up, Lorna.
Look, it's a birthday party.

23:01.505 --> 23:05.342
-I thought you said it was a memorial.
-Well, you know what I remember?

23:05.967 --> 23:06.802
Hmm.

23:07.803 --> 23:10.680
...is that I loved Ted and he loved me,

23:11.932 --> 23:13.308
and we had a really good marriage.

23:14.059 --> 23:17.687
And the only reason we ever had
any problems was because of you.

23:21.608 --> 23:25.529
We both know your marriage
was far from perfect.

23:26.113 --> 23:28.740
You don't know anything about my marriage.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.577
He called me. The night he died.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.121
Ted called me.

23:34.871 --> 23:36.581
Shall we talk about that?

23:39.376 --> 23:40.794
Go home, Lorna.

23:44.673 --> 23:48.385
[female officer sighs] And the golf club
you used on the car, where did you get it?

23:49.177 --> 23:51.179
God. I don't remember.

23:51.680 --> 23:52.848
You an avid golfer?

23:53.098 --> 23:53.932
No.

23:54.599 --> 23:57.018
So you just carry around
a golf club at night,

23:57.394 --> 24:00.772
nowhere near a golf course, just in case
you find something you might wanna smash?

24:01.356 --> 24:04.067
Yes. Yes, exactly.

24:05.318 --> 24:06.361
Thank you.

24:06.570 --> 24:08.405
All right. Ms. Hale,

24:09.114 --> 24:12.284
let me remind you that you are confessing
to a criminal act.

24:12.492 --> 24:16.079
If you didn't do it, it would be
in your best interest to tell me now.

24:16.163 --> 24:17.873
So, I'm gonna ask you again.

24:17.956 --> 24:20.959
-Did you do it?
-[heartbeat]

24:25.547 --> 24:26.381
I did it.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.179
[exhales deeply]

24:33.346 --> 24:34.222
I did it.

24:37.642 --> 24:40.270
And you have no idea how sorry I am.

24:43.523 --> 24:46.985
[Christopher] <i>Lord, make me</i>
<i>an instrument of your peace.</i>

24:47.569 --> 24:50.238
Where there is hatred, let me sow love.

24:50.780 --> 24:53.533
Where there is injury, pardon.

24:54.951 --> 24:57.496
Where there is darkness, light.

24:58.580 --> 25:00.832
For it is in giving that we receive.

25:01.374 --> 25:03.710
<i>It is in pardoning that we are pardoned.</i>

25:04.669 --> 25:08.548
It is in dying that we are born
to eternal life.

25:09.132 --> 25:10.008
Amen.

25:10.175 --> 25:13.428
All right.
Let's release the balloons, guys. Okay?

25:13.803 --> 25:17.057
-In three, two, one.
-[Henry] Two, one...

25:17.140 --> 25:18.016
[Jen] Go.

25:27.192 --> 25:29.736
-So, is that it?
-Yup. I think so.

25:30.904 --> 25:32.614
I thought something magical would happen.

25:34.282 --> 25:35.867
It's just not that kind of day, Boop.

25:42.707 --> 25:45.085
-I know what you're gonna say.
-Are you trying to get caught?

25:45.168 --> 25:46.002
No.

25:46.127 --> 25:49.214
Please. You don't have to follow
every impulse.

25:49.297 --> 25:52.259
-It is possible to have a bad idea.
-Okay. Thank you for coming.

25:52.634 --> 25:55.845
I was at dinner with my parents.
I had to lie and tell them my tummy hurt.

25:55.929 --> 25:58.265
You could've come up with a better lie.
You're 44.

25:58.348 --> 26:01.101
Well, I panicked, okay?
You almost gave me a heart attack.

26:01.476 --> 26:04.062
Well, it really wasn't very pleasant
for me, either.

26:04.145 --> 26:05.689
Oh, you didn't like jail? Try prison.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.441
I know. Oh, God.

26:09.568 --> 26:12.237
Thank you.
I appreciate you taking care of it.

26:17.409 --> 26:21.913
Listen, whether we like it or not,
we're both in this thing together.

26:24.666 --> 26:26.710
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

26:29.713 --> 26:31.590
You're right. I can't tell her.

26:32.299 --> 26:34.217
I don't wanna make
anyone's life any worse.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.135
Hey.

26:36.344 --> 26:37.178
Baby.

26:38.597 --> 26:39.973
You just listen to me.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.017
Trust me.

26:42.934 --> 26:44.519
It'll all be okay.

26:45.353 --> 26:46.187
Okay.

26:47.647 --> 26:48.690
I got you.

26:51.484 --> 26:52.569
I got you.

26:53.862 --> 26:54.696
Oh!

27:01.202 --> 27:02.245
[cheep]

27:04.289 --> 27:05.165
[cheep]

27:07.000 --> 27:08.126
[cheep]

27:08.835 --> 27:09.669
[cheep]

27:11.212 --> 27:12.756
Well, look who's back.

27:16.593 --> 27:18.553
[inhales and exhales sharply]

27:38.948 --> 27:41.159
[sighs] Happy birthday, baby.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.704
I miss you.

27:48.958 --> 27:49.834
I just...

27:51.795 --> 27:53.171
-Just wanted to say...
-[fluttering]

27:53.254 --> 27:55.465
Okay, fine.
I was trying a thing. Fuck you too.

27:56.216 --> 27:57.133
[sighs]

29:04.909 --> 29:06.119
[sniffles]

29:13.126 --> 29:14.252
[exhales]

29:18.339 --> 29:19.299
All right.

29:47.660 --> 29:48.620
Bambi?
