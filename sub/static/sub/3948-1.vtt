00:32.073 --> 00:35.493
In May 1980, the Korean military massacred
innocent citizens who wanted democracy.

00:35.577 --> 00:40.290
There were 4,122 confirmed casualties,
the highest since the Korean War.

00:40.373 --> 00:43.877
As a result, the military's top officer
became South Korea's 11th president.

00:43.960 --> 00:47.922
This movie is a work of fiction
based on these historical facts.

00:54.304 --> 00:56.681
Does it have a range of over 100 meters?

00:57.682 --> 00:58.558
No.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.896
Competition air rifles
don't have that kind of range.

01:03.063 --> 01:04.606
I guess you didn't believe me.

01:05.648 --> 01:08.068
You forced me to make it regardless.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.402
So I had no choice.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.322
I already had the money
deposited in my account.

01:21.873 --> 01:24.083
It's a scaled-down industrial compressor.

01:25.126 --> 01:28.046
If you use this to
compress the air, it'll work.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.757
The compression will take some time.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.467
It takes five seconds.

01:32.717 --> 01:35.595
It won't be that powerful
if there isn't enough air compressed.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.640
At the same time,
too much air will make it explode.

01:42.602 --> 01:43.436
<i>One,</i> <i>two,</i>

01:45.605 --> 01:46.439
<i>three,</i>

01:47.106 --> 01:47.941
<i>four.</i>

01:56.699 --> 01:58.076
Fuck!

02:09.379 --> 02:11.422
LAUGHTER WILL BRING GOOD FORTUNE.

02:17.053 --> 02:17.887
MAY 1980, GWANGJU

02:17.971 --> 02:21.349
"Sun" means kind and fine.

02:22.392 --> 02:23.685
"Sook" means clear.

02:24.269 --> 02:25.770
"Young" means flower.

02:26.229 --> 02:27.897
"Lim" means forest.

02:28.898 --> 02:31.025
"Mi" means beauty.

02:31.734 --> 02:34.946
"Jung" means righteous.
"Jin" means treasure.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.573
"Jin" also means progress.

02:37.031 --> 02:39.367
-Grace...
-That's it.

02:40.118 --> 02:43.288
-I like that one.
-What? Which one?

02:43.746 --> 02:46.166
-Jin?
-Yes, Jin.

02:46.457 --> 02:47.292
Mi-jin.

02:47.834 --> 02:48.960
Mi-jin Shim.

02:49.627 --> 02:51.254
Not the Jin that means treasure.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.299
-What was the other one?
-The one that means progress?

02:54.382 --> 02:55.884
Yes, that's it.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.802
It's not just a lovely name,

02:58.094 --> 03:00.638
but also has a good meaning.

03:01.097 --> 03:04.142
It means looking towards the future
like you hoped...

03:19.574 --> 03:23.745
Sun-hwa!

03:24.913 --> 03:26.664
What happened?

03:26.873 --> 03:29.792
Sun-hwa!

03:30.418 --> 03:32.086
Sun-hwa!

03:32.378 --> 03:33.838
Sun-hwa!

03:34.088 --> 03:36.633
Sun-hwa!

03:37.300 --> 03:40.345
What is all this?

03:40.720 --> 03:42.889
Sun-hwa!

03:52.690 --> 03:53.775
Damn it.

03:54.192 --> 03:55.902
Where the hell are we exactly going?

03:56.486 --> 03:58.488
-I don't know.
-Damn it.

04:02.951 --> 04:04.827
Hurry up and get off!

04:05.119 --> 04:06.829
Let's go, Gap-sae.
They want us to get off.

04:11.209 --> 04:15.713
-One, two, one, two.
-One, two, one, two.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.439
-Get out!
-Get out!

04:37.068 --> 04:38.194
-Get out!
-Get out!

04:38.278 --> 04:39.737
Jung-hyuk.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.407
-Get out!
-Get out!

04:42.532 --> 04:43.700
There are soldiers.

04:43.783 --> 04:45.493
-What?
-Wow.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.543
Fire! Jung-hyuk!

05:00.550 --> 05:01.384
Run!

05:04.095 --> 05:05.638
Hurry!

05:10.059 --> 05:11.853
Kill them all!

05:12.812 --> 05:13.855
Come quickly!

05:25.074 --> 05:26.576
Su-jin, hurry up.

05:31.247 --> 05:32.248
Su-jin.

05:33.750 --> 05:34.792
Are you okay?

05:38.129 --> 05:39.088
Su-jin.

05:40.757 --> 05:41.632
Jung-hyuk.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.804
You can go by yourself, right?

05:49.265 --> 05:50.475
I don't want to.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.935
Commie insurgents!

05:53.061 --> 05:55.521
Come here! Die!

05:58.107 --> 05:59.108
Quickly.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.569
You go ahead.

06:03.529 --> 06:05.907
I'll follow you soon.

06:07.867 --> 06:10.286
They're still alive! Get them!

06:10.369 --> 06:11.329
Let's go, kid!

06:11.537 --> 06:12.705
Get every one of them!

06:15.458 --> 06:16.584
Commie!

06:16.793 --> 06:17.752
Where are the rest?

06:18.044 --> 06:19.128
Where are they?

06:19.212 --> 06:22.090
Su-jin!

06:23.174 --> 06:25.009
There's another one! Get him!

06:25.093 --> 06:26.677
Su-jin!

06:28.721 --> 06:30.473
Su-jin! What have I done?

06:44.821 --> 06:49.033
What did I do wrong?

06:51.577 --> 06:53.329
Aren't you ashamed?

06:53.663 --> 06:55.998
You're a military officer.

07:28.364 --> 07:29.532
<i>Attention, team!</i>

07:30.074 --> 07:31.534
Damn commies!

07:33.161 --> 07:34.287
Damn commies!

07:35.371 --> 07:36.622
Damn commies!

07:37.874 --> 07:41.461
-Damn commies!
-Sang-ryul!

07:41.961 --> 07:42.962
Sang-ryul!

07:43.421 --> 07:44.255
Hey, man!

07:45.590 --> 07:47.133
What are you doing?

07:51.888 --> 07:52.722
No!

08:11.073 --> 08:11.908
Where is he?

08:12.575 --> 08:13.409
Mom.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.369
Where is he?

08:16.746 --> 08:18.164
Honey.

08:40.394 --> 08:41.270
Oh, no.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.897
What should we do?

08:52.532 --> 08:53.533
Honey!

09:07.296 --> 09:08.130
Mom.

09:13.970 --> 09:17.223
Honey!

09:20.059 --> 09:21.102
Mom.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.479
Don't cry.

09:24.313 --> 09:28.025
-How will we live by ourselves?
-Mom.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.876
Evil bastards.

09:47.169 --> 09:50.172
You evil bastards!

09:58.681 --> 10:04.020
<i>As the 11th president elected into office,</i>

10:04.645 --> 10:07.648
<i>I would like to thank
the people of the nation</i>

10:08.649 --> 10:13.446
<i>along with the members of
the National Conference for Unification.</i>

10:20.703 --> 10:22.788
What did I tell you before?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.416
My goodness. I'm sorry.

10:25.499 --> 10:26.334
YEAR 1983

10:26.417 --> 10:27.877
-I'm sorry.
-Hey, lady!

10:28.377 --> 10:31.672
You're mentally ill,
so you should stay home!

10:31.756 --> 10:33.382
I'm pretty sure that's the law!

10:33.799 --> 10:34.884
I'm sorry.

10:35.259 --> 10:39.639
-I'm sorry.
-I'll let it go this time.

10:39.722 --> 10:43.059
I'll forget what happened
earlier this month and today.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.019
So don't come starting tomorrow. Ma'am.

10:47.605 --> 10:49.565
-I'm sorry, ma'am.
-The president

10:50.441 --> 10:51.817
visited the market in Cheongjin-dong.

10:51.901 --> 10:54.403
-Stop apologizing already.
-He supported the merchants.

10:54.487 --> 10:56.072
How many times are you going to be sorry?

10:56.405 --> 10:57.782
How many times has it been?

10:58.074 --> 11:00.618
<i>In modest clothes,</i>

11:00.910 --> 11:05.414
<i>he inspected the cleanliness
of the alleys in Cheongjin-dong.</i>

11:09.168 --> 11:10.586
Hey.

11:10.878 --> 11:12.505
Where is her son?

11:12.588 --> 11:14.465
His name's Jin-bae, right?

11:17.468 --> 11:18.302
Mom.

11:20.513 --> 11:22.723
-Mom.
-<i>The president</i>

11:23.391 --> 11:25.393
-Mom.
-<i>revealed his support</i>

11:26.102 --> 11:30.481
<i>for the economic advancement
of the merchants.</i>

11:32.149 --> 11:34.568
<i>As someone leaving it all behind,</i>

11:34.652 --> 11:35.486
YEAR 1988

11:35.569 --> 11:39.073
<i>I don't have any regrets or desires left.</i>

11:40.866 --> 11:45.121
Dad, Seoul is way better
than Gwangju, isn't it?

11:45.204 --> 11:46.956
That's why we're moving, right?

11:49.583 --> 11:52.044
Let's ride a cruise ship in Seoul, okay?

11:52.378 --> 11:57.508
<i>He will go down in history
as the president who did his best.</i>

11:59.218 --> 12:02.221
Fucker!

12:08.310 --> 12:09.437
Stop!

12:21.824 --> 12:22.658
Here.

12:24.285 --> 12:25.286
YEAR 1997

12:25.661 --> 12:26.954
Be careful on your way.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.957
You'll have another chance next spring.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.378
What's with your father?

12:37.131 --> 12:40.634
<i>The former president
received a special pardon</i>

12:40.718 --> 12:45.222
<i>and was released from prison today
after two years.</i>

12:45.556 --> 12:48.517
<i>He apologized to the citizens...</i>

12:48.601 --> 12:51.353
Why is that on the news?

12:52.730 --> 12:54.356
-Chief.
-Yes?

12:54.732 --> 12:57.443
Doesn't it remind you
of the final scene in a mafia movie?

12:59.028 --> 12:59.945
Goodness.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.530
That's true.

13:01.822 --> 13:04.492
Hey, but don't you think he did
a pretty good job?

13:04.950 --> 13:06.243
He saved the economy.

13:06.494 --> 13:08.454
We even hosted the Olympics.
Don't you agree?

13:10.039 --> 13:10.998
Hey, sir.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.210
Give me a cigarette. It's cold.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.098
Hey, sir.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.311
Got a light? Let's go.

13:41.070 --> 13:42.780
Assholes.

13:45.449 --> 13:47.826
<i>The bus headed to Seoul is leaving.
Please board.</i>

13:47.952 --> 13:49.578
<i>The bus headed to Seoul is leaving.</i>

13:50.538 --> 13:53.123
-No special pardon!
-Punish the one in charge!

13:53.207 --> 13:55.876
<i>Some citizens are refusing
to accept the pardon</i>

13:55.960 --> 13:59.046
<i>and are showing it by staging a protest.</i>

13:59.672 --> 14:03.509
<i>-In particular, his hidden assets...</i>
-National unity?

14:05.219 --> 14:06.887
-Fuck you!
-My goodness.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.389
Take your dad home.

14:08.472 --> 14:10.432
Just kill me, fuckers.

14:11.517 --> 14:16.021
Shoot us all to death, you fuckers.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.275
I missed spring training again.

14:20.442 --> 14:21.694
Fuckers...

14:21.777 --> 14:22.820
I missed it because of you.

14:29.243 --> 14:31.036
Just die, Dad.

14:34.290 --> 14:35.833
Hurry up and go.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.837
I won't charge you today
since I'm in a good mood.

14:41.422 --> 14:42.423
Why?

14:43.340 --> 14:46.510
My son is being discharged
from the military today.

14:47.344 --> 14:48.345
Go home.

14:48.429 --> 14:50.347
-Really?
-Just hurry up and go.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.474
-Oh, my.
-I'm leaving then.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.852
I'll clean up quickly.

14:57.688 --> 14:59.023
Is he coming or not?

15:05.654 --> 15:08.490
THE FORMER PRESIDENT ARRIVED AT HIS HOUSE
AS HE WAS WELCOMED BY PEOPLE.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.044
THE FORMER PRESIDENT ARRIVED HIS HOUSE
AS HE WAS WELCOMED BY PEOPLE.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.180
No. Gosh.

15:44.818 --> 15:46.654
You haven't changed at all, Mom.

15:47.321 --> 15:48.781
You're exactly like how you were before.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.368
You haven't changed at all.

15:53.410 --> 15:54.495
Not at all.

16:05.547 --> 16:06.674
Go get him.

16:06.757 --> 16:07.591
YEAR 2003

16:07.675 --> 16:09.301
-Fuck!
-What is he?

16:10.302 --> 16:11.470
What's with that guy?

16:13.013 --> 16:15.265
-What is this?
-Come on, punks!

16:23.482 --> 16:24.400
My leg!

16:25.818 --> 16:27.486
Stop!

16:29.571 --> 16:31.323
Fucker!

16:35.369 --> 16:36.203
Hey.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.455
Do you have a death wish?

16:39.248 --> 16:40.124
What, fucker?

16:41.709 --> 16:42.710
Goodness!

16:47.214 --> 16:48.757
-I'm at a loss for words.
-He's crazy. Let's talk man-to-man.

16:51.635 --> 16:53.887
We're in the same business.
We don't have to do this.

16:53.971 --> 16:56.515
What do you mean the same business?

16:56.598 --> 16:59.309
You thugs are driving me insane.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.020
I'm sick of this!

17:01.103 --> 17:02.771
What is so difficult about it?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.398
You have wheels on your cart.

17:04.481 --> 17:05.858
Just push it and go!

17:05.941 --> 17:08.235
Stop making speeches.
Did I get shot in the head?

17:08.318 --> 17:10.195
Why would I leave a good location?

17:10.446 --> 17:13.240
My mom started here ten years ago!

17:13.323 --> 17:15.284
Do you have shit in your ears?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.953
Listen while I'm still being nice!

17:18.037 --> 17:19.663
Do what you want, you son of a bitch.

17:19.747 --> 17:22.708
You can even split me open if you want to!

17:22.791 --> 17:26.003
Who is he calling a thug?

17:26.962 --> 17:28.255
Fuckers.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.718
My eel is probably burned.

17:32.801 --> 17:34.803
I'll kill you all!

17:35.596 --> 17:36.597
Suho Gang?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.269
<i>As for Gwangju,</i>

17:43.062 --> 17:48.358
<i>insurrection occurred
when rioters took up arms.</i>

17:48.859 --> 17:51.028
<i>There was no choice
but to invoke martial law.</i>

17:51.737 --> 17:53.781
-Welcome...
-<i>Of course,</i>

17:54.031 --> 17:55.449
<i>politics should come to a standstill.</i>

17:56.825 --> 17:58.869
Are you really all that?

18:06.543 --> 18:07.377
Wow.

18:08.712 --> 18:12.091
The world is shitty enough
to make me sweat just sitting here.

18:12.716 --> 18:15.427
Gwangju people shouldn't fight
amongst themselves.

18:15.844 --> 18:19.848
I just came to try the noodles.

18:29.691 --> 18:31.568
Wow.

18:31.985 --> 18:33.612
The broth is great.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.537
When it comes to power,

18:42.496 --> 18:44.498
the key is to have balance.

18:45.332 --> 18:48.460
You can't survive on guts alone! Hey, don't look at me like that.

19:02.307 --> 19:04.810
I'm not a lowlife.

19:09.064 --> 19:11.233
You should come visit my place next time.

19:11.441 --> 19:13.652
I'll buy you a drink, okay?

19:18.323 --> 19:21.076
-Six, seven, eight, nine.
-<i>Next report.</i>

19:21.160 --> 19:24.538
<i>The former president is in court again
after six and a half years.</i>

19:24.872 --> 19:28.584
<i>In response to the judge's request
to reveal his assets,</i>

19:28.876 --> 19:32.045
<i>the former president stated that
his total net worth is 291,000 won.</i>

19:34.798 --> 19:36.967
<i>Take a look at my savings account.</i>

19:38.051 --> 19:41.597
<i>-The total balance is 291,000 won.</i>
-Son of a bitch!

19:43.765 --> 19:45.434
Fuck!

19:46.101 --> 19:47.352
Goodness!

19:47.728 --> 19:48.562
Damn it!

19:54.526 --> 19:57.112
It's so damned hot.

20:11.585 --> 20:12.461
Hey, Jung-hyuk.

20:12.836 --> 20:13.962
Just relax.

20:14.338 --> 20:15.797
Here.

20:16.673 --> 20:19.259
Focus and push the button
at the right time.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.427
Got it?

20:20.802 --> 20:21.929
-Yes.
-It's easy, right?

20:23.263 --> 20:24.598
Gosh, I can't believe this.

20:24.681 --> 20:28.352
He's just going to play badminton.
Why order the police around?

20:30.979 --> 20:32.147
I feel sorry for you.

20:33.023 --> 20:33.857
Why?

20:34.858 --> 20:36.109
In the beginning,

20:37.611 --> 20:39.696
it feels like being raped.

20:41.698 --> 20:42.950
What do you mean?

20:43.700 --> 20:44.534
You'll find out soon.

20:44.618 --> 20:46.662
-<i>Entering Seodaemun. Change the signal.</i>
-Here they come.

20:48.455 --> 20:51.541
YEAR 2005

20:51.625 --> 20:52.459
Here they come.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.170
<i>Change the signal.</i>

21:23.156 --> 21:26.034
POLICE OFFICER WORK NOTEBOOK

21:36.336 --> 21:37.170
Jung-hyuk.

21:37.754 --> 21:39.006
Are you hungry?

21:45.762 --> 21:46.888
Hurry up and eat.

21:47.723 --> 21:48.557
Su-jin.

21:50.058 --> 21:51.393
Now that I became a police officer,

21:53.228 --> 21:54.813
there's still nothing...

21:57.190 --> 21:58.150
Damn it.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.029
There's nothing I can do.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.823
Life is so harsh.

22:05.741 --> 22:07.701
It's so unfair.

22:08.869 --> 22:10.412
I'm sorry.

22:11.538 --> 22:14.541
I'm so sorry.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.962
Su-jin.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.715
Su-jin.

22:30.265 --> 22:31.266
Hey, come here.

22:31.475 --> 22:32.309
What's going on?

22:33.185 --> 22:34.436
Are you leaving again?

22:34.644 --> 22:37.397
-I have to go quickly.
-Hey, Won-bin.

22:37.898 --> 22:38.857
Why are you going?

22:39.357 --> 22:40.984
Jung-hyuk is supposed to be on duty.

22:41.485 --> 22:42.527
Is he sick?

22:43.111 --> 22:46.281
I don't think Jung-hyuk can handle this.

22:46.698 --> 22:47.699
What are you talking about?

22:48.075 --> 22:50.077
He never says anything,

22:50.160 --> 22:53.163
but I heard his sister died
during the Gwangju Uprising.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.753
That makes sense. Go ahead.

23:10.430 --> 23:11.598
Please go.

23:11.681 --> 23:14.309
-You shouldn't be here.
-Hey.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.062
Don't work at places like this.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.147
-Go home!
-You go home.

23:19.231 --> 23:21.608
It's dangerous, so go home!

23:21.691 --> 23:23.944
It's more dangerous for you!
Just quickly leave!

23:24.027 --> 23:25.612
Aren't you really going?

23:25.737 --> 23:26.571
Sir.

23:27.280 --> 23:29.241
You'll get arrested if you drink here.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.201
Sir, listen to me.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.078
Sir. Sir, what...

23:34.079 --> 23:35.205
What is that?

23:35.288 --> 23:37.707
-Don't!
-Sons of bitches!

23:37.791 --> 23:39.668
What are you doing?

23:39.751 --> 23:41.378
-Hurry!
-Put out the fire!

23:42.879 --> 23:43.713
Come out.

23:44.297 --> 23:46.091
Gwangju is still in pain.

23:46.550 --> 23:48.468
It's dying in agony!

23:48.885 --> 23:50.137
Come out and apologize!

23:50.220 --> 23:52.973
-What the hell? Get him!
-Come out, you bastard!

23:53.682 --> 23:55.142
Hey!

23:55.433 --> 23:57.853
-Come out, fucker!
-Stop him!

23:57.936 --> 23:59.312
Grab the bottle!

24:04.109 --> 24:05.152
What's going on?

24:07.028 --> 24:07.904
Don't move!

24:12.742 --> 24:15.412
Get the fire extinguisher!

24:16.371 --> 24:17.622
Put the fire out!

24:32.929 --> 24:35.098
-Get something to cover him.
-What are you doing? Leave!

24:35.182 --> 24:37.893
-Take care of him.
-Quickly!

24:38.393 --> 24:39.728
Take care of it quickly!

24:39.811 --> 24:41.188
Call the local police.

24:53.074 --> 24:53.909
<i>Mi-jin.</i>

24:54.659 --> 24:56.578
<i>Your name is Mi-jin.</i>

24:56.661 --> 24:58.455
<i>Mi-jin.</i>

24:58.538 --> 25:02.918
<i>So you can move forward with courage.</i>

25:04.127 --> 25:06.213
Do you know who named you?

25:08.548 --> 25:09.633
Your mother.

25:10.592 --> 25:12.302
She's the one who chose your name.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.434
<i>After your mother died,</i>

25:21.019 --> 25:23.104
<i>we moved to Seoul.</i>

25:24.564 --> 25:30.362
<i>I wanted to take the chance
to start a new life with you.</i>

25:31.154 --> 25:31.988
<i>It's the truth.</i> Dad.

25:58.765 --> 26:03.103
YEAR 2006

26:03.853 --> 26:09.359
TWENTY-SIX YEARS LATER

26:12.779 --> 26:14.197
<i>He seized power with a coup d'état.</i>

26:14.281 --> 26:17.450
<i>He is a convicted felon
who was sentenced to death.</i>

26:17.534 --> 26:22.038
<i>In addition, he was fined 220 billion won,
but said he only had 290,000 won.</i>

26:22.247 --> 26:24.291
<i>He has yet to pay it.</i>

26:24.416 --> 26:27.085
<i>Many of our listeners
have probably forgotten about it,</i>

26:27.502 --> 26:32.632
<i>but he still lives a luxurious lifestyle
and still has power to this day.</i>

26:32.716 --> 26:33.717
Thank you.

26:34.134 --> 26:35.218
Have you all eaten?

26:35.719 --> 26:37.554
Someone is here to see you.

26:37.637 --> 26:38.471
Who?

26:38.722 --> 26:39.806
I don't know.

26:47.522 --> 26:48.982
We're closed.

26:50.608 --> 26:51.651
I know.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.075
I know you from somewhere.

27:00.076 --> 27:01.119
I guess you still remember.

27:02.037 --> 27:05.749
I met you at your father's funeral.

27:17.761 --> 27:20.305
You're not from around here. What can I do for someone like you?

27:27.896 --> 27:30.815
Is it that difficult for you to say it?

27:31.858 --> 27:32.692
What is it?

27:33.360 --> 27:35.278
Do you want me to kill someone?

27:37.655 --> 27:39.574
Wow, I guess it's true.

27:42.660 --> 27:43.995
I don't know what it is.

27:44.746 --> 27:45.663
But whatever it is,

27:46.081 --> 27:49.125
just settle it and move on.

27:50.335 --> 27:51.169
Okay?

27:53.755 --> 27:55.173
Okay, I'm done.

28:03.056 --> 28:03.932
Take care.

28:04.557 --> 28:05.392
It's someone

28:06.643 --> 28:07.977
you know as well.

28:56.276 --> 28:57.819
Here, take one.

29:20.383 --> 29:24.095
Coming all the way here
must have been hard for all of you.

29:25.013 --> 29:25.930
My name is

29:27.640 --> 29:28.767
Gap-sae Kim.

29:30.643 --> 29:33.688
Thank you for coming.

29:36.274 --> 29:38.485
My name is Joo-an Kim.

29:41.070 --> 29:42.530
I'm the chairman's secretary.

29:45.992 --> 29:47.368
This is Jung-hyuk Kwon.

29:47.744 --> 29:48.995
He's a police officer.

29:51.289 --> 29:54.584
This is Mi-jin Shim who is a member
of the national shooting team.

29:56.836 --> 29:59.047
-This is...
-Gwangju thug, Jin-bae Kwak.

30:00.173 --> 30:02.550
What a random group.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.345
All of you here

30:06.387 --> 30:08.807
are survivors of the Gwangju Uprising.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.771
Although we don't know each other well,

30:15.939 --> 30:20.443
I thought we could
all work together on this.

30:20.944 --> 30:21.778
Just a moment.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.489
Let's put the kids aside for now.

30:25.198 --> 30:27.075
What is your story?

30:27.534 --> 30:30.495
Why would someone like you do this?

30:31.079 --> 30:33.581
I'll answer that
on behalf of the chairman.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.542
I didn't ask you.

30:37.377 --> 30:39.629
What? Are you a survivor too?

30:39.712 --> 30:41.297
-No.
-Then?

30:44.300 --> 30:45.134
I...

30:46.386 --> 30:47.470
I was a soldier.

30:51.808 --> 30:53.685
This is ridiculous.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.021
I can't just let this go.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.524
Let me confirm something then.

31:01.651 --> 31:02.485
Have you ever...

31:04.487 --> 31:06.239
killed someone from Gwangju?

31:16.124 --> 31:16.958
Above all,

31:18.126 --> 31:20.962
as a soldier involved
in the Gwangju Uprising,

31:21.629 --> 31:22.922
I would like to apologize first.

31:24.465 --> 31:25.466
I'm sorry.

31:29.554 --> 31:32.432
In May 1980, I was...

31:33.057 --> 31:33.975
That's enough.

31:38.396 --> 31:40.857
Let's make a distinction
between our curiosity and what we need.

31:42.859 --> 31:44.861
I don't care about anyone here.

31:46.154 --> 31:49.782
I don't care if he was a soldier
who killed Gwangju people.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.703
As long as we have the same goal,
that's enough for me.

31:54.621 --> 31:56.706
You're really something else.

32:03.004 --> 32:03.838
I'm in.

32:06.507 --> 32:10.136
Are you really going to kill him?

32:11.429 --> 32:13.598
I just want him to apologize
and to regret what he did.

32:15.016 --> 32:18.895
All I want is to see him
beg for forgiveness.

32:19.812 --> 32:23.858
Everything else will depend
on his attitude.

32:25.485 --> 32:26.319
Me too.

32:28.529 --> 32:29.405
I'll do it too.

32:39.040 --> 32:40.500
Shit.

32:41.042 --> 32:45.088
Are we going to make a blood pledge now?

32:54.097 --> 32:57.809
I don't know if it will taste like
how it did before.

32:58.393 --> 33:01.104
It's not my restaurant,
so I couldn't find kimchi.

33:01.187 --> 33:04.649
This is enough. What more could I ask for?

33:12.532 --> 33:14.951
Thank you for everything.

33:18.538 --> 33:21.624
I never thanked you.

33:24.043 --> 33:24.877
But...

33:27.255 --> 33:28.172
I'm sorry.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.011
There is something I need to do.

33:37.724 --> 33:38.808
Please let me go.

33:45.064 --> 33:46.733
You need to do something?

33:49.736 --> 33:50.820
What is it?

33:56.242 --> 33:57.160
I'm sorry,

33:58.202 --> 33:59.412
but I can't tell you what it is.

34:02.623 --> 34:03.958
Have you forgotten?

34:06.711 --> 34:08.129
I'm also a thug.

34:09.964 --> 34:11.340
And you're my family.

34:13.509 --> 34:14.761
You have to give me a reason.

34:17.597 --> 34:18.556
I'm going to Seoul

34:23.352 --> 34:24.645
to buy cigarettes.

34:30.234 --> 34:32.695
You little punk.

34:45.625 --> 34:46.626
DATA RESEARCH

34:47.126 --> 34:48.669
I'm sure you already know

34:49.128 --> 34:50.880
that he has armed guards
and police escorts

34:50.963 --> 34:52.173
whenever he goes on his outings.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.218
He looks familiar.

34:56.469 --> 34:57.553
At times,

34:58.054 --> 35:00.515
he also has personal security guards
depending on the situation.

35:01.432 --> 35:04.352
That's why we can't estimate
the scale of his security detail.

35:05.228 --> 35:06.813
LOCATION WHERE
MI-JIN'S FATHER KILLED HIMSELF

35:11.150 --> 35:14.153
The residences nearby are either vacant
or used for security purposes.

35:14.737 --> 35:18.616
There could be several other buildings
used for security other than these.

35:20.159 --> 35:23.496
If we include the suspicious buildings,

35:26.165 --> 35:27.500
this is the estimated scope.

35:30.044 --> 35:33.840
It's impossible to enter his home
or apprehend him outside of it.

35:34.841 --> 35:35.675
Oh, right.

35:35.842 --> 35:37.510
This place

35:38.511 --> 35:42.473
was built with the same layout
as his mansion.

36:11.752 --> 36:13.462
Approach while he's out.
Infiltrate his house.

36:15.464 --> 36:16.966
-Hello.
-Hello.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.471
-What the heck?
-<i>Look over here.</i>

36:23.681 --> 36:25.558
-Sir.
-<i>Click.</i>

36:26.225 --> 36:27.143
What are you doing?

36:30.146 --> 36:30.980
<i>First,</i>

36:31.439 --> 36:33.566
<i>let's start by shaking up the guards.</i>

36:34.775 --> 36:36.110
<i>The entrance is blocked off</i>

36:36.194 --> 36:40.448
<i>with uniformed officers
and personal security guards.</i>

36:42.241 --> 36:45.453
<i>They check all cars
and people passing through.</i>

36:46.120 --> 36:49.665
<i>Those who do not have prior permits
cannot access the premises.</i>

36:51.459 --> 36:54.629
<i>Once, college students were arrested
for attempting to enter the premises.</i>

36:55.296 --> 36:56.923
<i>There were several failed attempts.</i>

36:58.591 --> 37:03.179
<i>Every time such incidents happened,
they increased the number of officers.</i>

37:03.804 --> 37:05.389
<i>That's how its security was strengthened.</i>

37:06.182 --> 37:08.184
<i>It's impossible to infiltrate directly.</i>

37:08.726 --> 37:12.563
<i>We need to have a sophisticated
and detailed strategy.</i>

37:12.772 --> 37:13.731
See you later.

37:16.984 --> 37:18.361
<i>If we charge in recklessly,</i>

37:19.195 --> 37:23.032
-<i>we'll never be able to move even a meter.</i>
-Hey, it's me again.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.160
-It's me.
-What?

37:26.244 --> 37:27.328
-What?
-Stop!

37:27.411 --> 37:28.746
-You!
-Stop! Gosh, that little...

37:37.046 --> 37:38.172
Leave!

37:39.590 --> 37:41.676
Stop stretching and just go!

37:43.803 --> 37:44.679
Just go!

37:45.596 --> 37:46.514
What is he doing? Go!

37:49.600 --> 37:51.269
-What is he doing?
-Goodness!

37:53.312 --> 37:54.355
One more time!

37:55.314 --> 37:57.483
-What was that?
-Gosh, he's crazy.

37:59.902 --> 38:00.820
Hey!

38:02.405 --> 38:04.615
-One more time!
-What is he doing?

38:21.382 --> 38:22.258
What?

38:55.249 --> 38:56.751
Who the hell is that? Get him!

39:01.297 --> 39:04.258
Two hundred ninety thousand won!

39:04.717 --> 39:06.927
Come out, fucker!

39:07.011 --> 39:08.262
Shut him up first!

39:08.637 --> 39:10.097
Shut him up first!

39:16.687 --> 39:20.149
Why is it so noisy
on a residential street?

39:21.692 --> 39:24.612
-Shut it.
-What are you doing?

39:29.283 --> 39:30.534
Who are you?

39:30.868 --> 39:31.911
Are you the one in charge?

39:32.286 --> 39:33.496
I didn't ask for you.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.164
Is the old man inside?

39:35.748 --> 39:38.834
Today's the day he dies.
Does that bastard even know that?

39:39.960 --> 39:40.795
Fuck!

39:43.047 --> 39:44.548
-Is he unarmed?
-Mr. Ma.

39:46.842 --> 39:47.676
Let him go.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.598
Did I come unarmed? Fuck, yes.

40:03.067 --> 40:04.443
Why are you doing this?

40:05.111 --> 40:06.529
Would you take the hint

40:07.321 --> 40:10.866
if I say it's for my father
who died in Gwangju 26 years ago?

40:16.414 --> 40:20.084
You shouldn't underestimate this place.

40:23.379 --> 40:26.715
You're pretty strong, aren't you?

40:27.299 --> 40:29.218
I'll call it a day for now.

40:34.807 --> 40:36.267
But make sure to let him know.

40:36.600 --> 40:38.978
I'll come back and kill him.

40:39.270 --> 40:42.273
-So don't die and wait for me...
-Bastard!

40:44.275 --> 40:46.193
Go toss him somewhere.

40:47.611 --> 40:48.446
What?

40:48.696 --> 40:50.114
Let's hand him over to the police.

40:54.368 --> 40:55.202
Throw him out.

41:02.334 --> 41:05.880
This is his final schedule
that's been confirmed.

41:15.556 --> 41:17.766
<i>Joo-an? It's Jin-bae.</i>

41:18.100 --> 41:20.686
<i>I did a little cleaning up
in the alley today.</i>

41:21.103 --> 41:22.646
<i>When I woke up from a nap,</i>

41:23.189 --> 41:24.899
<i>-those jerks...</i>
-What do you see around you?

41:24.982 --> 41:26.650
-<i>Here?</i>
-Yes.

41:26.775 --> 41:29.945
<i>I see something pointed.</i>

41:30.070 --> 41:31.697
<i>It's hot here, so hurry up!</i>

41:53.385 --> 41:56.430
Fuck, my mouth is so messed up.
I can't even taste the cigarette.

41:59.058 --> 42:00.267
Why didn't you disguise yourself?

42:01.727 --> 42:03.687
Why would I disguise myself?
I'm not a kid.

42:06.607 --> 42:09.902
I hope they move according to our plan.

42:13.572 --> 42:14.573
Don't worry.

42:15.032 --> 42:16.659
I took care of it.

42:19.578 --> 42:23.082
I heard that the chairman
is actually your father.

42:26.126 --> 42:26.961
Yes.

42:29.296 --> 42:31.674
What an impressive family.

42:40.432 --> 42:41.350
Nice shot.

42:44.395 --> 42:47.690
The incident a few days ago
makes me uneasy.

42:48.524 --> 42:51.735
I believe it's time to increase security.

42:52.111 --> 42:52.945
Go ahead. However,

42:58.492 --> 43:00.494
I'm worried about
what the public would think

43:01.245 --> 43:02.371
if we utilize the police again.

43:02.663 --> 43:05.708
I'll search for external guards this time.

43:10.337 --> 43:12.464
All right, do whatever you'd like to.

43:25.769 --> 43:27.521
The weather has improved.

43:28.731 --> 43:30.274
Should I head out to the field?

43:30.441 --> 43:31.525
Please do, Your Excellency.

43:32.526 --> 43:33.569
Your Excellency...

43:38.282 --> 43:39.116
What?

43:39.658 --> 43:40.868
Worried about the public opinion? Public opinion.

43:51.879 --> 43:52.713
What?

43:53.422 --> 43:55.341
Why did you let the thug go?

43:55.924 --> 43:57.259
You're strange.

43:57.343 --> 43:58.927
Why would you make us work twice?

44:00.137 --> 44:01.347
It will be May soon.

44:02.598 --> 44:04.391
Make sure the media doesn't find out.

44:04.975 --> 44:05.976
We have to be careful.

44:06.226 --> 44:08.187
Why are you so concerned about
what the public thinks?

44:08.812 --> 44:10.689
It's my job to manage them.

44:11.065 --> 44:11.899
Besides,

44:12.316 --> 44:15.694
recruiting external security
is also within my jurisdiction.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.613
So stay out of it.

44:17.946 --> 44:20.407
Let's go by the system. This isn't
the first time we're doing this.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.330
Don't do anything stupid.

44:27.831 --> 44:29.416
His Excellency's safety is on the line.

44:41.762 --> 44:44.181
LITERATURE BOOKSTORE

44:54.400 --> 44:58.529
I thought I'd buy a book.

44:59.738 --> 45:01.365
I heard you worked hard yesterday.

45:02.199 --> 45:04.076
It wasn't a big deal.

45:16.004 --> 45:16.839
Wow.

45:17.339 --> 45:18.966
Is this a rifle for competitions?

45:19.383 --> 45:22.469
This is pretty cool.

45:25.222 --> 45:27.015
If you have something to say, just say it.

45:29.309 --> 45:30.144
Okay.

45:31.228 --> 45:35.023
I understand how you feel.

45:35.691 --> 45:37.109
But stay out of this.

45:40.112 --> 45:41.155
You're young.

45:41.405 --> 45:42.573
You're still in your 20s.

45:42.906 --> 45:45.242
You should be living your life.

45:46.577 --> 45:48.787
My life has nothing to do with you.

45:52.875 --> 45:53.709
Right. That's true.

45:55.544 --> 45:56.462
It doesn't.

45:57.463 --> 46:00.257
But getting yourself involved
in this line of work is a waste

46:01.884 --> 46:02.843
because you're too pretty.

46:03.385 --> 46:04.720
It's a waste.

46:05.053 --> 46:07.723
What a worthless advice.

46:18.442 --> 46:20.152
I'm not looking down at you.

46:21.445 --> 46:23.197
As someone older than you,

46:23.655 --> 46:25.449
I'm giving you this advice.

46:29.244 --> 46:32.623
Someone who died before me
is more important to me.

46:34.833 --> 46:36.168
Isn't it the same for you?

46:50.599 --> 46:51.892
Hey!

46:52.309 --> 46:53.227
What's going on?

46:54.102 --> 46:56.188
-Boss!
-What is this?

47:06.240 --> 47:07.366
PROSECUTOR
WOO-HYUK KANG

47:09.368 --> 47:10.452
Beethoven?

47:11.286 --> 47:12.871
You thugs have high standards.

47:13.997 --> 47:15.624
It's Mozart.

47:17.209 --> 47:18.168
Hey, Su-ho.

47:19.378 --> 47:20.295
Where is Jin-bae Kwak?

47:22.089 --> 47:23.257
Jin-bae?

47:26.969 --> 47:28.136
Why are you looking for him?

47:33.267 --> 47:34.101
Hey.

47:34.601 --> 47:36.770
Blackmail and instigation
are pretty serious.

47:37.062 --> 47:38.772
Stashing him away won't solve anything.

47:40.482 --> 47:43.819
His opponent is the former president.

47:47.406 --> 47:49.241
You don't need a calculator
to figure it out, right?

47:53.078 --> 47:53.912
Hey.

47:54.705 --> 47:55.956
Turn off the engine.

47:57.541 --> 47:59.042
Do you finally get it?

48:00.335 --> 48:04.047
Hand over Jin-bae Kwak
and negotiate with us.

48:04.631 --> 48:07.593
If you don't hand him over,
you have to take the bullet for him.

48:09.720 --> 48:10.804
I sent Jin-bae...

48:13.890 --> 48:15.976
to buy cigarettes.

48:18.061 --> 48:20.480
<i>Jin-bae, Boss got arrested.</i>

48:21.898 --> 48:22.858
<i>What are we going to do?</i>

48:23.358 --> 48:25.944
<i>We lost our place in Gwangju.</i>

48:41.585 --> 48:44.671
Have you bought cigarettes?

48:45.881 --> 48:47.424
I haven't bought it yet.

48:51.595 --> 48:52.721
Jin-bae.

48:53.722 --> 48:55.641
This thing that you're trying to do...

48:56.683 --> 48:59.853
Is it really the only way?

49:00.354 --> 49:04.274
Is it the right thing to do?
I honestly don't know.

49:04.983 --> 49:06.318
Even so,

49:08.278 --> 49:12.574
at the very least
because I never even considered it,

49:15.535 --> 49:17.412
I deserve to be in here.

49:20.957 --> 49:22.042
Until now,

49:23.126 --> 49:26.171
I've been living in Geumnamro
without any worries.

49:29.466 --> 49:30.676
Now,

49:32.135 --> 49:33.595
I feel guilty.

49:37.641 --> 49:38.975
Shit.

49:42.020 --> 49:43.647
I'm ashamed of the way I lived my life.

49:55.951 --> 49:56.785
Boss.

49:58.245 --> 49:59.121
Jin-bae.

50:03.083 --> 50:04.960
Don't look back.

50:06.128 --> 50:08.630
Look ahead and run like hell.

50:15.887 --> 50:18.181
The building was purchased years ago
for this purpose.

50:20.183 --> 50:22.728
This person will be helping you, Mi-jin.

50:30.777 --> 50:33.029
It's 600 meters ahead at two o'clock.

50:48.378 --> 50:49.671
It's like a maze.

50:56.511 --> 50:58.138
This is the best we can do.

51:13.236 --> 51:15.238
Were you sad because
I didn't visit every day?

51:16.156 --> 51:17.908
I've been busy working in Seoul.

51:21.244 --> 51:25.207
The doctor told me that
you're much better now.

51:25.665 --> 51:28.251
Let's go home once this is over, okay?

51:30.712 --> 51:33.465
Oh, do you remember?

51:34.424 --> 51:36.426
The soldier who killed your father.

51:37.594 --> 51:39.554
He came by a while ago.

51:42.724 --> 51:43.558
He was crying.

51:47.145 --> 51:48.855
He asked for forgiveness.

51:50.023 --> 51:54.444
He begged me for forgiveness while crying.

51:58.490 --> 51:59.491
<i>But...</i>

52:02.577 --> 52:04.162
<i>I didn't cry.</i>

52:06.248 --> 52:08.041
<i>All I did was look at him.</i>

52:09.167 --> 52:11.711
<i>I couldn't cry at all.</i>

52:17.008 --> 52:18.844
Here you go again. Don't cry.

52:25.851 --> 52:27.644
You've aged,

52:28.854 --> 52:30.730
but you are still the same.

52:33.483 --> 52:34.651
<i>You've never changed.</i>

52:36.152 --> 52:37.904
<i>You're still foolish.</i>

52:55.964 --> 52:58.508
Here is the material you asked for.

52:59.968 --> 53:00.802
Good work.

53:01.636 --> 53:02.637
It was difficult to obtain.

53:06.141 --> 53:08.143
Jin-bae's gang suffered a huge blow.

53:10.020 --> 53:11.897
As expected,
the prosecution got directly involved.

53:12.647 --> 53:15.650
But we haven't heard anything yet.

53:16.026 --> 53:19.154
They must be trying to intimidate us
without creating a big issue.

53:20.488 --> 53:22.574
They moved faster than expected.

53:23.366 --> 53:25.160
They're also getting help
from the government.

53:25.493 --> 53:27.329
We need to speed things up.

53:40.508 --> 53:42.719
You're the one who killed my father?

53:44.346 --> 53:48.683
You cried and put on a show
for my poor mother?

53:49.142 --> 53:51.186
You even begged her for forgiveness?

53:55.732 --> 53:56.566
So...

53:57.984 --> 54:00.445
Is that why you came to me?

54:00.779 --> 54:02.197
For revenge?

54:02.572 --> 54:05.784
You're trying to manipulate
the son of the man you killed!

54:05.951 --> 54:08.370
Fuck, is this what it's about?

54:08.453 --> 54:09.663
Jin-bae!

54:11.539 --> 54:12.707
Stop whining.

54:14.334 --> 54:17.671
My father and I suffered
as much as you did.

54:18.380 --> 54:19.422
You're not alone.

54:20.924 --> 54:22.425
I didn't plan to hide it.

54:24.177 --> 54:26.680
I just didn't think it was the right time
to ask for forgiveness.

54:28.181 --> 54:29.557
You might find it ridiculous,

54:30.725 --> 54:33.228
but I wanted to give us both a chance.

54:35.647 --> 54:37.565
If you want to kill someone,
make a choice.

55:05.760 --> 55:07.137
Fuck.

55:09.055 --> 55:11.182
Why is this so complicated?

55:12.267 --> 55:14.144
Keeping this up won't give us anything.

55:16.187 --> 55:18.481
What are you going to do?

55:21.526 --> 55:22.527
I'm going to kill him.

55:25.238 --> 55:26.156
Mi-jin.

55:26.990 --> 55:29.451
Killing him isn't my goal.

55:30.076 --> 55:32.454
My goal is to make him repent.

55:33.580 --> 55:36.082
We have given him enough chances already.

55:37.584 --> 55:38.668
It has been decades.

55:40.795 --> 55:43.882
<i>You were ordered for traffic
signal control support before, right?</i>

55:44.507 --> 55:47.761
<i>Yes, but I don't do that anymore.</i>

55:47.844 --> 55:48.845
<i>Do me a favor.</i>

55:49.971 --> 55:50.805
<i>It's simple.</i>

55:52.640 --> 55:54.684
<i>Just stall for five seconds.</i>

56:00.273 --> 56:02.067
Die, bastards!

56:02.442 --> 56:05.028
Sons of bitches.

56:05.361 --> 56:07.447
My wife is dead.

56:08.073 --> 56:09.991
Everyone is dead.

56:10.075 --> 56:14.162
What is that? I'm going to kill you all!

56:15.622 --> 56:17.248
Sons of bitches.

56:17.582 --> 56:20.877
They already have everything.
What about me?

56:30.845 --> 56:32.806
Buy food instead of alcohol.

56:36.518 --> 56:37.435
You should eat first.

56:39.229 --> 56:40.230
Then you can drink.

56:50.031 --> 56:52.784
SEODAEMUN POLICE STATION

56:53.284 --> 56:54.119
Salute!

56:56.454 --> 56:57.622
Why are you here?

56:58.873 --> 56:59.833
Aren't you on support?

57:02.210 --> 57:04.754
Well, I was told I didn't have to go.

57:06.506 --> 57:07.715
No matter how I think about it,

57:08.341 --> 57:10.718
I don't think this is right.

57:11.636 --> 57:15.807
<i>If ever Mi-jin gets hurt,
our plans would be ruined.</i>

57:17.142 --> 57:20.937
-<i>Jin-bae is the closest right now.</i>
-That idiot! Fuck!

57:21.521 --> 57:24.065
<i>He's departing soon. Take your positions.</i>

57:27.318 --> 57:28.445
<i>He has departed.</i>

57:28.528 --> 57:29.988
<i>He will be in Seodaemun in five minutes.</i>

57:33.616 --> 57:36.369
These police officers are working hard.

57:37.203 --> 57:40.373
They're being rewarded accordingly, right?

57:40.748 --> 57:43.251
Yes, Mr. Tak handles that.

57:49.591 --> 57:51.176
<i>He's passing the rotary.</i>

57:51.259 --> 57:53.094
<i>He will be there in three minutes.
Please stand by.</i>

57:57.974 --> 58:00.894
<i>He has passed Namgajwa Intersection.
Prepare the next signal.</i>

58:10.195 --> 58:13.198
<i>Prepare Seodaemun Intersection.
He will be there in two minutes.</i>

58:20.830 --> 58:21.664
Are you hot?

58:22.540 --> 58:24.459
Why are you sweating so much
when you're young?

58:25.960 --> 58:27.295
It's nothing.

58:35.678 --> 58:36.804
Hey, Jung-hyuk.

58:37.096 --> 58:42.143
I heard you volunteered
to be on duty today.

58:45.522 --> 58:46.439
Why?

58:51.319 --> 58:53.988
Isn't it tough for you to be here?

58:54.072 --> 58:56.282
<i>He's entering Seodaemun.
Change the signal.</i>

59:05.291 --> 59:06.376
<i>Change the signal.</i>

59:08.336 --> 59:09.295
What are you doing?

59:10.046 --> 59:11.673
<i>Change the signal.</i>

59:13.424 --> 59:16.261
-Hurry up and change the signal!
-<i>Change the signal.</i>

59:27.355 --> 59:29.065
<i>He's passing through Seodaemun.</i>

59:43.496 --> 59:45.999
What are you doing?

59:46.708 --> 59:47.709
Move it!

1:00:02.682 --> 1:00:03.516
<i>One.</i>

1:00:06.769 --> 1:00:07.604
<i>Two.</i>

1:00:10.189 --> 1:00:12.358
-It can't be.
-What's that?

1:00:14.193 --> 1:00:15.153
<i>Three.</i>

1:00:18.990 --> 1:00:19.824
<i>Four.</i>

1:00:22.201 --> 1:00:23.036
<i>Five.</i>

1:00:39.385 --> 1:00:41.137
-Damn it!
-It's too weak.

1:00:43.389 --> 1:00:44.223
No!

1:00:47.477 --> 1:00:48.394
Let go, you bastard!

1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:50.355
Hey!

1:00:50.438 --> 1:00:52.023
-You punk!
-Don't go!

1:00:52.357 --> 1:00:55.860
<i>One, two, three,</i>

1:00:56.486 --> 1:00:57.320
<i>four...</i>

1:01:02.325 --> 1:01:03.284
<i>Too weak again.</i>

1:01:04.369 --> 1:01:07.997
-You can't!
-Hey! Let go!

1:01:08.373 --> 1:01:10.583
-I can't!
-You punk!

1:01:11.542 --> 1:01:12.543
Out of the way!

1:01:17.090 --> 1:01:17.924
<i>One,</i> <i>two...</i>

1:01:22.220 --> 1:01:24.972
Are you insane? Let go, you bastard!

1:01:25.139 --> 1:01:27.725
<i>Three, four!</i>

1:01:29.560 --> 1:01:30.478
Security!

1:01:30.853 --> 1:01:33.690
<i>Five, six!</i>

1:01:35.358 --> 1:01:36.192
Die.

1:01:39.153 --> 1:01:40.279
Die!

1:01:47.745 --> 1:01:48.705
Police!

1:01:52.291 --> 1:01:53.334
Don't move!

1:02:03.428 --> 1:02:04.929
You little punk.

1:02:05.888 --> 1:02:07.849
-Check if His Excellency is safe.
-Yes, sir!

1:02:11.227 --> 1:02:12.395
Protect His Excellency!

1:02:12.478 --> 1:02:14.814
Cover His Excellency! Hurry!

1:02:35.376 --> 1:02:37.253
Damn it! Don't move!

1:02:38.004 --> 1:02:38.838
Jung-hyuk!

1:02:51.684 --> 1:02:54.145
It's okay.

1:02:57.231 --> 1:02:58.691
Damn it! What are you doing? Hurry up!

1:03:15.792 --> 1:03:17.418
Dad, I'm sorry.

1:03:24.884 --> 1:03:25.927
This is as far as I can go.

1:03:28.721 --> 1:03:29.680
Damn!

1:04:03.673 --> 1:04:04.841
Joo-an.

1:04:08.094 --> 1:04:08.928
Joo-an. Let it go.

1:04:11.806 --> 1:04:12.890
Don't you understand?

1:04:14.642 --> 1:04:15.893
I'm not doing this because of you.

1:04:17.436 --> 1:04:18.729
I'm doing this for myself.

1:04:19.272 --> 1:04:20.314
I'm doing this so I can live.

1:04:21.190 --> 1:04:22.733
I'm risking my life so I can live.

1:04:27.071 --> 1:04:28.072
Please don't stop me.

1:04:29.824 --> 1:04:30.867
We have already come so far.

1:04:31.158 --> 1:04:32.243
But not like this!

1:04:32.994 --> 1:04:35.454
From now on, I'll handle things!
I'll do this myself.

1:04:36.247 --> 1:04:37.331
You can't do it alone.

1:04:39.709 --> 1:04:42.962
What happened may have complicated things,
but I know we can still succeed.

1:04:43.838 --> 1:04:44.839
I'll take care of it.

1:04:44.922 --> 1:04:46.340
What can you take care of?

1:04:50.720 --> 1:04:53.180
We all have our own reasons!

1:04:56.058 --> 1:04:59.979
We may die trying,
but we can't go on living either.

1:05:00.271 --> 1:05:01.105
You know that.

1:05:29.884 --> 1:05:33.471
SEOUL SHOOTING INCIDENT
BETWEEN RIVAL GWANGJU GANGS

1:06:09.507 --> 1:06:11.842
He's right in front of me.

1:06:12.259 --> 1:06:14.178
-<i>Hey.</i>
-I'll bring him in.

1:06:14.261 --> 1:06:16.806
<i>Don't talk so much. Just follow him.</i>

1:06:16.889 --> 1:06:17.765
All right, I understand.

1:06:25.523 --> 1:06:27.608
It was on the news yesterday.

1:06:28.859 --> 1:06:30.444
What gangs?

1:06:31.070 --> 1:06:33.030
You're great at making stuff up.

1:06:35.408 --> 1:06:36.242
What is this? What?

1:06:40.788 --> 1:06:41.914
This is the guy from yesterday.

1:06:45.126 --> 1:06:48.546
He came here not long ago.

1:06:56.679 --> 1:06:59.682
-Let's eat first.
-Okay.

1:06:59.765 --> 1:07:01.475
<i>In a one-horse open sleigh</i>

1:07:01.559 --> 1:07:03.686
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>

1:07:07.523 --> 1:07:08.983
I see that you're finally awake.

1:07:09.442 --> 1:07:10.484
But you shouldn't be up.

1:07:10.776 --> 1:07:13.779
You should stay in bed.
You lost a lot of blood.

1:07:14.405 --> 1:07:16.866
-You will still feel dizzy.
-How is my hand?

1:07:17.116 --> 1:07:18.159
Well...

1:07:18.284 --> 1:07:20.077
No guests were here.

1:07:20.244 --> 1:07:21.245
Are you left-handed?

1:07:23.122 --> 1:07:23.956
No.

1:07:24.331 --> 1:07:25.332
You will be fine then.

1:07:26.375 --> 1:07:27.251
Are you hungry?

1:07:27.334 --> 1:07:29.211
We're ordering Chinese food.
What do you want?

1:07:29.336 --> 1:07:31.547
-That place?
-Their <i>jjamppong</i> is great.

1:07:31.630 --> 1:07:34.508
-That's it.
-Seven bowls of <i>jjamppong</i>.

1:07:35.259 --> 1:07:37.595
Eight dumplings as service.

1:07:39.430 --> 1:07:40.931
Come out, you punks.

1:07:41.474 --> 1:07:43.309
You even studied abroad.

1:07:43.934 --> 1:07:46.270
Why would someone like you
be so determined to join the former president's
security detail?

1:07:49.398 --> 1:07:51.817
Aren't you satisfied with being
number one in the field?

1:07:52.193 --> 1:07:53.194
I may be number one,

1:07:53.277 --> 1:07:55.446
but I haven't had the opportunity
to work for an elite.

1:07:56.530 --> 1:07:59.742
I think working for the president
would help build the company image.

1:08:00.159 --> 1:08:03.788
Right, you can't disregard status.

1:08:05.456 --> 1:08:07.541
You've never played
in the big leagues, right?

1:08:08.417 --> 1:08:12.046
I happened to hear that
you're increasing security.

1:08:12.713 --> 1:08:17.343
There are more lunatics out there lately.

1:08:18.552 --> 1:08:21.263
We need to move quickly
at times like this.

1:08:21.680 --> 1:08:25.017
But there are so many security firms.

1:08:25.851 --> 1:08:29.522
-Excuse me.
-The competition is fierce.

1:08:30.731 --> 1:08:32.191
You crazy son of a bitch.

1:08:32.983 --> 1:08:34.026
Do you want to die?

1:08:34.110 --> 1:08:35.569
What a stupid bastard.

1:08:36.070 --> 1:08:37.696
Wow.

1:08:37.905 --> 1:08:39.198
I like that type.

1:08:41.534 --> 1:08:44.411
I'm sorry for the delay,
but here are your car keys.

1:08:53.420 --> 1:08:54.964
So that's where my keys were.

1:09:00.302 --> 1:09:03.055
There are several boxes of apples
in the trunk.

1:09:04.723 --> 1:09:05.558
Apples?

1:09:06.392 --> 1:09:07.685
Apples are nice.

1:09:08.144 --> 1:09:09.603
They are simple and traditional.

1:09:11.939 --> 1:09:16.402
I also have a small gift
for His Excellency.

1:09:17.695 --> 1:09:20.823
Educated people definitely stand out.

1:09:23.909 --> 1:09:24.869
I like you.

1:09:26.829 --> 1:09:28.372
<i>The lecture will begin soon.</i>

1:09:28.455 --> 1:09:31.208
<i>We invite all guests to attend
the lecture.</i>

1:09:32.126 --> 1:09:35.504
<i>Once again, the lecture will begin soon.</i>

1:09:35.588 --> 1:09:38.674
<i>We invite all guests to attend
the lecture.</i>

1:09:38.757 --> 1:09:40.217
LECTURE BY THIS ERA'S GREATEST PRESIDENT

1:09:47.016 --> 1:09:50.853
For the era's greatest president,

1:09:50.936 --> 1:09:56.108
let us bow and wish him longevity!

1:09:56.525 --> 1:09:59.153
Everyone, please step forward!

1:10:14.752 --> 1:10:18.631
-We wish you longevity!
-We wish you longevity!

1:10:31.685 --> 1:10:35.481
-Thank you!
-Please return to your seats!

1:10:37.066 --> 1:10:38.567
Return to your seats.

1:10:45.950 --> 1:10:48.244
BACKGROUND CHECK
MI-JIN SHIM

1:10:52.748 --> 1:10:54.208
-Did you find it?
-Yes.

1:10:54.583 --> 1:10:55.417
Let me see.

1:10:57.211 --> 1:10:59.588
They don't appear to be connected.

1:11:00.172 --> 1:11:03.425
Higher-ups are asking us
to close the case.

1:11:03.717 --> 1:11:04.551
Hey.

1:11:05.177 --> 1:11:06.720
Doesn't something smell fishy to you?

1:11:07.012 --> 1:11:07.846
What do you mean? Look.

1:11:10.641 --> 1:11:14.228
Her mom and his dad both died
during the Gwangju Uprising.

1:11:14.561 --> 1:11:16.105
So what?

1:11:16.313 --> 1:11:17.815
Goodness.

1:11:19.191 --> 1:11:21.735
Is that why Jung-hyuk...

1:11:23.153 --> 1:11:24.196
Quiet, punk.

1:11:25.072 --> 1:11:26.991
His sister died
during the Gwangju Uprising.

1:11:28.701 --> 1:11:32.371
Is that why the higher-ups ordered to
disband the special investigation team?

1:11:35.791 --> 1:11:37.084
Something must be really going on.

1:11:37.876 --> 1:11:38.711
Hey.

1:11:39.336 --> 1:11:41.338
Did you find the car at the intersection?

1:11:42.089 --> 1:11:43.716
They already closed the case,

1:11:44.091 --> 1:11:46.343
so I stopped investigating.

1:11:46.677 --> 1:11:47.511
You punk. Why?

1:11:50.389 --> 1:11:51.515
The registration is fake.

1:11:52.182 --> 1:11:53.225
That's obvious.

1:11:53.726 --> 1:11:55.311
-Hey.
-What? Investigate internally.

1:11:57.730 --> 1:12:00.941
Tell the guy trailing Jung-hyuk
to keep quiet, okay?

1:12:13.412 --> 1:12:14.413
Rest up.

1:12:26.842 --> 1:12:29.803
You sure don't listen.
I told you to lie down.

1:12:33.265 --> 1:12:34.099
Move over. Is this it?

1:12:37.978 --> 1:12:39.688
This looks more normal.

1:12:45.444 --> 1:12:47.029
It looks kind of complicated though.

1:12:49.365 --> 1:12:52.409
It's supposed to have
a range of 800 meters.

1:12:55.287 --> 1:12:58.332
This is a modified M-16.

1:12:58.415 --> 1:13:00.334
It must be automatic then.

1:13:00.542 --> 1:13:01.377
Right?

1:13:03.504 --> 1:13:05.506
Why did you insert it like this?

1:13:07.591 --> 1:13:09.843
-Do you know how to assemble that?
-Yes.

1:13:11.136 --> 1:13:13.764
They teach you how to do this
when you join a gang.

1:13:15.724 --> 1:13:19.228
Were you scared?
This place is filled with thugs.

1:13:20.646 --> 1:13:21.855
I don't get scared easily.

1:13:24.108 --> 1:13:26.944
You're great at scaring others though.

1:13:30.197 --> 1:13:31.031
I'm sorry.

1:13:34.159 --> 1:13:35.160
What matters is you know.

1:13:38.163 --> 1:13:38.997
And...

1:13:42.209 --> 1:13:43.127
thank you.

1:13:46.380 --> 1:13:47.881
It's fine as long as you're aware of it.

1:13:47.965 --> 1:13:48.799
Here.

1:13:55.764 --> 1:13:59.768
So that's what you look like
when you smile!

1:14:03.021 --> 1:14:05.190
I better live righteously.

1:14:05.941 --> 1:14:08.402
I suddenly want to live that way.

1:14:26.753 --> 1:14:28.464
Jung-hyuk, all this time...

1:14:28.755 --> 1:14:30.716
I wouldn't have agreed
if I knew it would be like this.

1:14:35.804 --> 1:14:36.930
Everything is ruined.

1:14:40.017 --> 1:14:40.851
You're right.

1:14:40.934 --> 1:14:44.021
I regret how things turned out,
but we still...

1:14:44.104 --> 1:14:44.980
Turn yourselves in.

1:14:45.689 --> 1:14:46.523
All of you. What?

1:14:53.947 --> 1:14:54.781
I...

1:14:55.908 --> 1:14:57.910
I'll make sure to get reinstated
no matter what happens.

1:14:59.244 --> 1:15:00.078
So

1:15:01.246 --> 1:15:02.331
let's just end it here.

1:15:03.999 --> 1:15:06.376
-I'll wait at the police station.
-Jung-hyuk.

1:15:17.387 --> 1:15:20.557
He met someone, but I'm not sure who.

1:15:20.641 --> 1:15:21.475
<i>See?</i>

1:15:21.558 --> 1:15:22.684
What did I tell you?

1:15:24.353 --> 1:15:26.688
Anyway, don't lose him
and just keep watching him, okay?

1:15:27.397 --> 1:15:28.232
Good work.

1:15:32.027 --> 1:15:35.822
Why don't we just conduct
an open investigation?

1:15:35.906 --> 1:15:37.824
We can catch him immediately.

1:15:37.908 --> 1:15:39.159
We can't do that.

1:15:40.953 --> 1:15:42.329
Just proceed as secretly as possible.

1:15:42.788 --> 1:15:45.207
What exactly do you want from me?

1:15:45.582 --> 1:15:48.835
If we keep covering this up
and something happens later,

1:15:49.127 --> 1:15:51.213
I'll be the one on the chopping block.

1:15:51.838 --> 1:15:52.673
To put it bluntly,

1:15:52.923 --> 1:15:56.134
will the former president
take responsibility if I get fired?

1:15:59.721 --> 1:16:00.722
My goodness.

1:16:00.973 --> 1:16:02.933
This is so frustrating.

1:16:06.353 --> 1:16:07.521
What are you doing?

1:16:09.523 --> 1:16:10.607
Welcome, Jin-bae.

1:16:11.608 --> 1:16:14.069
-Hello, Jin-bae!
-Welcome, Jin-bae!

1:16:15.529 --> 1:16:16.446
Please come in.

1:16:16.738 --> 1:16:18.198
This way.

1:16:23.203 --> 1:16:24.329
What is all this?

1:16:25.497 --> 1:16:27.624
We just noticed that
you're not eating properly.

1:16:28.375 --> 1:16:30.377
That's why we decided
to prepare some food.

1:16:34.423 --> 1:16:35.257
Jin-bae.

1:16:36.758 --> 1:16:37.801
Let us go with you.

1:16:39.052 --> 1:16:40.429
Let's buy cigarettes together.

1:16:41.555 --> 1:16:43.432
Stop saying nonsense.

1:16:43.515 --> 1:16:44.683
Let's be honest here.

1:16:45.350 --> 1:16:46.685
You need manpower.

1:16:47.060 --> 1:16:48.312
What about the boss?

1:16:48.562 --> 1:16:49.396
Jin-bae.

1:16:51.273 --> 1:16:53.066
We went to see the boss this morning.

1:16:58.780 --> 1:17:00.324
You should give him a chance.

1:17:00.741 --> 1:17:03.327
And give us a chance too.

1:17:04.536 --> 1:17:05.537
Isn't that right?

1:17:06.163 --> 1:17:07.664
-That's right!
-That's right!

1:17:47.829 --> 1:17:50.207
Is Jung-hyuk out for good?

1:17:51.958 --> 1:17:52.793
Yes.

1:17:52.918 --> 1:17:56.004
He's such a coward.
Is he out there starving?

1:17:58.924 --> 1:18:00.550
We received word that a date has been set.

1:18:06.473 --> 1:18:07.307
However,

1:18:08.266 --> 1:18:11.645
the police are on high alert
due to the previous incident.

1:18:13.188 --> 1:18:17.484
That's why we need
to create a huge diversion.

1:18:18.610 --> 1:18:19.903
We need to distract the police.

1:18:20.821 --> 1:18:21.822
I'll go.

1:18:22.614 --> 1:18:25.367
I was planning to go anyway.
I made a promise.

1:18:26.785 --> 1:18:28.829
That's what I said
to the head of security.

1:18:29.329 --> 1:18:31.415
I promised him that I would be back.

1:18:33.500 --> 1:18:34.668
But what about the escape route?

1:18:36.712 --> 1:18:39.214
Can you escape safely without my help?

1:18:44.428 --> 1:18:45.512
Let's eat.

1:18:52.394 --> 1:18:54.020
I'm hungry, so come quickly and eat. It's me. What happened?

1:19:21.214 --> 1:19:24.217
<i>I lost the car Jung-hyuk got in.</i>

1:19:24.551 --> 1:19:25.385
What? <i>I lost it.</i>

1:19:27.387 --> 1:19:28.430
How could you lose it?

1:19:28.680 --> 1:19:32.267
-You're a police officer.
-<i>He stopped by a restroom.</i>

1:19:32.350 --> 1:19:35.604
<i>I had to use the restroom too,
but he was gone when I came out.</i>

1:19:36.480 --> 1:19:38.523
-It was Honam Expressway, right?
-<i>Yes.</i>

1:19:39.399 --> 1:19:42.110
He probably went to Gwangju.
Just come back for now.

1:19:42.194 --> 1:19:44.821
<i>I can go back? I'll be on my way then.</i>

1:19:44.905 --> 1:19:47.657
-What?
-Is Jung-hyuk there?

1:19:47.741 --> 1:19:48.617
-Yes.
-<i>Okay.</i>

1:19:48.700 --> 1:19:50.452
-<i>He looked awful yesterday.</i>
-He's here.

1:19:50.702 --> 1:19:51.787
<i>Is he okay?</i>

1:19:52.913 --> 1:19:54.039
<i>Are you listening? Hello?</i>

1:19:58.210 --> 1:19:59.044
I...

1:20:00.462 --> 1:20:02.631
I really want to succeed this.

1:20:06.551 --> 1:20:08.678
My parents also died
during the Gwangju Uprising.

1:20:12.599 --> 1:20:13.767
In front of my eyes.

1:20:17.395 --> 1:20:20.774
My current father raised me.

1:20:22.526 --> 1:20:23.693
What happens after...

1:20:30.075 --> 1:20:31.034
I'm not so sure.

1:20:34.454 --> 1:20:35.747
I haven't thought about it.

1:20:37.916 --> 1:20:38.834
I see.

1:20:40.877 --> 1:20:43.421
I guess you only live for today.

1:20:45.131 --> 1:20:46.049
You're just like me.

1:20:47.759 --> 1:20:49.094
I'm starting to like you.

1:20:58.645 --> 1:20:59.855
Why aren't you eating?

1:21:03.900 --> 1:21:05.777
Hey, just eat first.

1:21:05.861 --> 1:21:06.695
Here.

1:21:11.032 --> 1:21:14.035
What will happen to me now?

1:21:18.248 --> 1:21:20.625
I placed you on sick leave,
so stop worrying.

1:21:21.251 --> 1:21:23.545
Just come to work as usual, okay?

1:21:25.255 --> 1:21:29.759
It's normal for people to make mistakes.

1:21:30.552 --> 1:21:32.762
That's how life is. Don't you agree?

1:21:42.731 --> 1:21:46.234
Why are you so kind to me?

1:21:52.115 --> 1:21:53.825
We're colleagues.

1:22:05.211 --> 1:22:07.422
YOOYOUNG CEMETERY

1:22:14.012 --> 1:22:17.724
You're always running off.

1:22:22.437 --> 1:22:23.396
That's my mom.

1:22:23.480 --> 1:22:24.898
SUN-HWA KWON
MAY 22, 1980

1:22:28.193 --> 1:22:29.152
That's my dad.

1:22:29.235 --> 1:22:30.195
DONG-HOON KWAK
MAY 23, 1980

1:22:32.948 --> 1:22:37.911
It's really strange seeing this.

1:22:40.830 --> 1:22:41.873
I know.

1:22:42.332 --> 1:22:44.709
It's like they all belong to one family.

1:22:46.294 --> 1:22:48.964
This side and that side...

1:22:56.763 --> 1:22:58.056
It really does seem that way.

1:23:08.525 --> 1:23:09.484
Are you scared?

1:23:22.414 --> 1:23:24.249
Just cry and let it all out.

1:23:25.083 --> 1:23:26.292
You should do that at least once.

1:23:50.400 --> 1:23:51.317
Later.

1:23:56.698 --> 1:23:57.907
All at once.

1:24:04.372 --> 1:24:06.374
SU-JIN KWON
MAY 22, 1980

1:24:21.222 --> 1:24:24.559
<i>Over 5,000 survivors and politicians
attended the commemoration</i>

1:24:24.642 --> 1:24:27.604
<i>of the 26th anniversary
of the Gwangju Uprising this morning</i>

1:24:27.687 --> 1:24:29.564
<i>at the National Cemetery on May 18.</i>

1:24:29.898 --> 1:24:30.899
<i>Following the commemoration,</i>

1:24:30.982 --> 1:24:35.653
<i>a tribute was held throughout the day
for those who died in the uprising.</i>

1:24:55.215 --> 1:24:58.343
Over 5,000 Attend the Commemoration
Of Gwangju Uprising 26th Anniversary

1:24:58.510 --> 1:25:01.012
SEODAEMUN POLICE STATION

1:25:03.223 --> 1:25:04.057
What is it?

1:25:04.641 --> 1:25:05.850
It's the car at the intersection.

1:25:07.519 --> 1:25:09.020
Didn't you say the registration was fake?

1:25:09.104 --> 1:25:10.188
Yes, but I looked into it.

1:25:10.772 --> 1:25:14.234
It is frequently seen in this building.

1:25:21.866 --> 1:25:23.201
-X-Cop?
-Yes.

1:25:23.409 --> 1:25:24.536
What kind of a company is this?

1:25:24.619 --> 1:25:26.079
-Did you find out?
-Yes.

1:25:26.704 --> 1:25:30.959
It's known as a reputable company
in the industry.

1:25:31.543 --> 1:25:34.796
It's very well-known,
and their finances are also solid.

1:25:36.089 --> 1:25:36.923
Is that all?

1:25:38.091 --> 1:25:39.926
You should be investigating the people.

1:25:40.009 --> 1:25:41.177
I wrote it down.

1:25:41.261 --> 1:25:44.430
What was the name again?

1:25:44.514 --> 1:25:45.515
It's Gap-sae Kim.

1:25:48.309 --> 1:25:50.854
That car belongs to the chairman's
executive secretary, Joo-an Kim.

1:26:04.075 --> 1:26:05.410
<i>Identify the vehicle.</i>

1:26:06.578 --> 1:26:07.662
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1:26:09.455 --> 1:26:10.331
Go check.

1:26:13.251 --> 1:26:14.169
Can I help you?

1:26:14.377 --> 1:26:15.503
I have an appointment.

1:26:15.587 --> 1:26:16.796
<i>I'm Joo-an Kim from X-Cop.</i>

1:26:16.880 --> 1:26:17.922
<i>You're not on the list.</i>

1:26:19.632 --> 1:26:21.467
-Please check with your superiors.
-Just a moment.

1:26:22.135 --> 1:26:24.888
What should we do
about the visitors from X-Cop?

1:26:27.098 --> 1:26:28.600
-<i>Let them in.</i>
-All right.

1:26:28.850 --> 1:26:29.684
Let them in. Welcome.

1:27:00.590 --> 1:27:02.258
I heard you were coming from Mr. Tak.

1:27:02.467 --> 1:27:03.927
-Right.
-Come in.

1:27:05.678 --> 1:27:06.512
Hold on.

1:27:07.597 --> 1:27:10.683
You will have to be searched
before you can enter.

1:27:11.559 --> 1:27:14.187
-Is there a problem?
-It's just our standard procedure.

1:27:21.819 --> 1:27:22.695
This way, please.

1:27:23.780 --> 1:27:24.781
Go ahead. Nothing out of the ordinary.

1:27:41.339 --> 1:27:42.173
Please enter.

1:27:43.424 --> 1:27:44.467
What is that?

1:27:50.723 --> 1:27:52.892
It's the chairman's gift
for His Excellency.

1:27:55.728 --> 1:27:58.106
We will have to inspect what it is.

1:28:01.192 --> 1:28:02.193
Please show them what it is.

1:28:15.164 --> 1:28:15.999
Open it.

1:28:18.751 --> 1:28:20.461
Don't touch it, you punk!

1:28:21.170 --> 1:28:22.088
Close it.

1:28:23.756 --> 1:28:25.717
What are you doing
to His Excellency's guests?

1:28:26.009 --> 1:28:29.470
How dare you open a gift
meant for His Excellency?

1:28:35.518 --> 1:28:36.477
I'm sorry.

1:28:36.853 --> 1:28:38.688
I apologize on their behalf.

1:28:39.147 --> 1:28:40.440
Please come in.

1:28:50.742 --> 1:28:51.576
Mr. Ma.

1:28:52.243 --> 1:28:53.870
I personally vouch for them.

1:29:02.378 --> 1:29:03.212
Open the door.

1:29:26.277 --> 1:29:29.322
Should I give you some privacy?

1:29:29.405 --> 1:29:30.573
There is no need for that.

1:29:30.656 --> 1:29:31.491
It's okay.

1:29:31.574 --> 1:29:33.284
You should freely talk to him.

1:29:33.701 --> 1:29:35.119
We can just talk later.

1:29:36.746 --> 1:29:38.122
This way.

1:29:39.957 --> 1:29:41.084
Please wait here.

1:29:59.060 --> 1:29:59.894
Attention!

1:30:00.895 --> 1:30:02.855
Listen carefully.

1:30:04.440 --> 1:30:06.067
Get your weapons out.

1:30:08.236 --> 1:30:10.863
Put them down.

1:30:11.656 --> 1:30:12.615
What is he talking about?

1:30:12.698 --> 1:30:15.034
-Hurry up!
-Put them down.

1:30:18.162 --> 1:30:20.248
-Take it easy.
-Remember.

1:30:21.374 --> 1:30:23.084
You can't use your knives even if you die.

1:30:24.377 --> 1:30:27.630
You can't injure anyone.

1:30:28.131 --> 1:30:29.006
Got it?

1:30:30.258 --> 1:30:33.136
We're not thugs today.

1:30:35.805 --> 1:30:38.391
We're Gwangju's sons. Remember that!

1:30:51.904 --> 1:30:53.406
Please go in.

1:31:12.925 --> 1:31:14.844
Would you like to have coffee
in my office?

1:31:15.094 --> 1:31:16.304
No, thank you.

1:31:16.554 --> 1:31:19.015
-I will just wait for the chairman here.
-All right then.

1:31:40.036 --> 1:31:42.330
When you're up there,

1:31:43.247 --> 1:31:44.874
what you see is what you get.

1:31:45.708 --> 1:31:47.877
That's the best we can do.

1:31:49.170 --> 1:31:50.087
I know.

1:31:55.009 --> 1:31:57.720
I will also pick the location.

1:31:57.845 --> 1:31:59.347
I've done this more than a hundred times.

1:32:00.181 --> 1:32:02.475
-It will be accurate...
-Quiet.

1:32:05.353 --> 1:32:08.397
<i>After receiving and creating art,</i>

1:32:09.565 --> 1:32:11.817
I developed an eye for it.

1:32:16.739 --> 1:32:18.407
But this...

1:32:27.750 --> 1:32:29.752
This is...

1:32:30.086 --> 1:32:31.254
a masterpiece.

1:32:35.132 --> 1:32:36.342
I like it.

1:32:37.385 --> 1:32:39.053
<i>Thank you.</i>

1:32:41.389 --> 1:32:45.351
<i>But why did you want to see me?</i>

1:32:45.643 --> 1:32:46.644
Please have a seat.

1:32:54.610 --> 1:32:56.737
I see that you injured your toe.

1:32:58.114 --> 1:33:01.951
You put a bandage on it because it hurts.

1:33:03.869 --> 1:33:06.289
It's been 26 years.

1:33:09.417 --> 1:33:11.419
I've encountered countless setbacks
during that time.

1:33:12.712 --> 1:33:14.171
It was painful,

1:33:14.964 --> 1:33:18.551
but I was able to come this far
because of it.

1:33:21.095 --> 1:33:23.306
I made sure I would become
the head of a major corporation.

1:33:24.515 --> 1:33:26.225
That's because not just anyone
can meet you.

1:33:27.059 --> 1:33:28.936
And I had to meet you.

1:33:31.105 --> 1:33:32.064
<i>I came here today</i>

1:33:33.024 --> 1:33:34.734
because I need to hear your response.

1:33:35.026 --> 1:33:35.985
My response?

1:33:36.360 --> 1:33:37.737
Twenty-six years ago today,

1:33:38.487 --> 1:33:41.157
in May of 1980, to be exact...

1:33:41.907 --> 1:33:42.992
Do you remember what happened?

1:33:43.326 --> 1:33:44.160
What?

1:33:44.243 --> 1:33:47.413
Your attitude will decide
if you deserve to live or not.

1:33:49.123 --> 1:33:52.835
<i>Why are you talking about
such an old event?</i>

1:33:53.794 --> 1:33:56.130
<i>I already addressed that.</i>

1:33:57.048 --> 1:33:58.090
Listen carefully.

1:33:59.216 --> 1:34:03.971
The soldiers did that
to defend themselves.

1:34:07.475 --> 1:34:11.354
<i>I wasn't aware of it
until I heard a report.</i>

1:34:12.313 --> 1:34:14.065
The soldiers did it to defend themselves?

1:34:15.024 --> 1:34:16.067
You were unaware?

1:34:16.692 --> 1:34:17.526
I...

1:34:18.444 --> 1:34:19.779
I was one of the soldiers.

1:34:20.279 --> 1:34:21.781
Those were your orders.

1:34:22.198 --> 1:34:23.824
Admit the truth, and ask for forgiveness.

1:34:24.658 --> 1:34:26.452
<i>Everything will end quietly that way.</i>

1:34:26.911 --> 1:34:29.705
It already ended quietly.

1:34:30.122 --> 1:34:32.833
It may be over for you,
but it hasn't ended for me.

1:34:34.126 --> 1:34:38.130
In order to ascend the throne,
you trampled on innocent civilians.

1:34:38.422 --> 1:34:40.299
They all died because of you.

1:34:41.634 --> 1:34:44.512
Even until now after 26 years,

1:34:44.804 --> 1:34:48.891
you've never uttered a word of apology.

1:34:49.016 --> 1:34:51.852
Hey, listen.

1:34:53.020 --> 1:34:54.688
I'm getting bored of this.

1:35:04.907 --> 1:35:05.741
Bored?

1:35:06.700 --> 1:35:08.536
I wondered what this was about.

1:35:11.330 --> 1:35:12.164
What is it?

1:35:12.456 --> 1:35:15.960
The new security firm
is called X-Cop, right?

1:35:16.043 --> 1:35:19.964
<i>The executive secretary is Joo-an Kim.
The chairman is Gap-sae Kim.</i>

1:35:20.256 --> 1:35:22.174
<i>I'm kind of uneasy
since it is May 18 today.</i>

1:35:22.258 --> 1:35:24.510
<i>That's why I've decided to go there.
We're on our way.</i>

1:35:25.845 --> 1:35:26.679
Hello? Hello?

1:35:28.848 --> 1:35:29.890
Mr. Ma!

1:35:31.225 --> 1:35:33.018
Damn it. Hey, step on it!

1:35:35.229 --> 1:35:38.149
-Arrest him!
-What is this?

1:35:38.232 --> 1:35:40.443
-Block the entrance!
-What is going on?

1:35:44.363 --> 1:35:47.283
What is the matter?
Why are you so serious?

1:35:48.742 --> 1:35:50.453
I told you not to do anything stupid.

1:35:51.287 --> 1:35:52.121
Wait here.

1:35:56.709 --> 1:35:57.877
You're bored?

1:35:58.711 --> 1:36:00.671
Like I said, it wasn't me.

1:36:00.754 --> 1:36:02.131
Because of your orders,

1:36:03.007 --> 1:36:05.468
I had to murder a lot of people.

1:36:05.718 --> 1:36:07.261
Why are you still denying?

1:36:07.344 --> 1:36:10.931
You should leave now.

1:36:11.557 --> 1:36:13.809
Where did Mr. Tak go?

1:36:15.394 --> 1:36:17.855
Because evildoers like you

1:36:19.565 --> 1:36:22.067
prosper without remorse,

1:36:22.693 --> 1:36:23.694
this society...

1:36:26.322 --> 1:36:28.073
This society is corrupted.

1:36:34.038 --> 1:36:35.873
You bastard.

1:36:38.876 --> 1:36:41.086
I received special training.

1:36:42.213 --> 1:36:45.132
Do you think a gun will scare me?

1:36:45.216 --> 1:36:48.511
<i>Listen, take out the guys from X-Cop.
It's an emergency!</i>

1:36:48.844 --> 1:36:49.845
Bastard!

1:36:56.018 --> 1:36:58.521
-People come and go.
-Beg for forgiveness!

1:37:02.441 --> 1:37:06.820
You should be ashamed of what you did.

1:37:10.616 --> 1:37:11.700
Gap-sae Kim!

1:37:14.036 --> 1:37:18.791
I secured an escape route.

1:37:19.166 --> 1:37:20.376
I don't need it.

1:37:24.213 --> 1:37:25.214
Okay.

1:38:05.129 --> 1:38:06.672
-What is that?
-What is it?

1:38:07.339 --> 1:38:08.507
They're cops.

1:38:09.466 --> 1:38:10.426
Shit.

1:38:10.843 --> 1:38:13.053
-Follow them. Step on it!
-Okay.

1:38:37.494 --> 1:38:40.914
Hey brat, you better succeed!

1:39:10.694 --> 1:39:12.738
Do you know each other?

1:39:14.657 --> 1:39:16.033
I'm sorry, Your Excellency.

1:39:16.867 --> 1:39:18.285
Why don't you catch up?

1:39:21.789 --> 1:39:25.959
-Son of a bitch? How dare you?
-What's going on?

1:39:26.043 --> 1:39:27.378
Take care of it in the study.

1:39:30.547 --> 1:39:35.344
Looks like young people
don't like me that much.

1:39:37.429 --> 1:39:39.306
I never did anything to them.

1:39:40.432 --> 1:39:41.308
It's just the beginning.

1:40:01.078 --> 1:40:03.372
-Hurry up and get off!
-All right.

1:40:03.539 --> 1:40:05.040
-What happened to Mr. Ma?
-Hurry!

1:40:05.124 --> 1:40:07.084
-He's not responding on the radio.
-Block this area.

1:40:07.167 --> 1:40:09.086
Block the alley over there!

1:40:10.546 --> 1:40:12.548
-Channel 88!
-Jung-hyuk, come here.

1:40:12.798 --> 1:40:16.760
Our nation has become great.

1:40:23.100 --> 1:40:24.017
What is that?

1:40:26.061 --> 1:40:27.938
-Block the front!
-What is that?

1:40:30.399 --> 1:40:32.901
-Block them! Run!
-Who are they?

1:40:33.193 --> 1:40:34.361
It's probably Jin-bae Kwak.

1:40:35.863 --> 1:40:37.197
A little more.

1:40:43.036 --> 1:40:45.789
Long time no see!

1:40:47.374 --> 1:40:49.042
Charge!

1:40:49.585 --> 1:40:50.544
Stop them!

1:40:56.633 --> 1:40:57.843
We need backup!

1:41:10.939 --> 1:41:12.191
Just a little more.

1:41:14.026 --> 1:41:14.943
Got you.

1:41:37.007 --> 1:41:38.342
-What is that?
-What is that?

1:41:39.259 --> 1:41:40.427
-What is going on?
-Hey!

1:41:46.183 --> 1:41:48.352
Fucking charge!

1:42:14.670 --> 1:42:16.463
I found it!

1:42:26.557 --> 1:42:29.268
Did you get him? Answer me!

1:42:29.518 --> 1:42:30.477
Are you all right?

1:42:39.111 --> 1:42:40.445
-Freeze!
-Shit.

1:42:40.529 --> 1:42:41.363
Are you all right?

1:42:41.446 --> 1:42:44.533
<i>We have located the sniper.
We will quickly take care of this.</i>

1:42:50.664 --> 1:42:55.294
The anchor is busted!
We can't lower the crane!

1:42:55.377 --> 1:42:57.421
Hey, get that door open!

1:43:01.675 --> 1:43:02.509
Mr. Ma!

1:43:05.137 --> 1:43:07.097
Arrest those rioters!

1:43:07.347 --> 1:43:11.476
How can you let rioters
get so close in broad daylight?

1:43:11.560 --> 1:43:12.603
Rioters? Don't call us that.

1:43:15.564 --> 1:43:16.773
We're not rioters.

1:43:17.316 --> 1:43:20.861
Your men were the actual rioters.

1:43:20.944 --> 1:43:21.778
Understand?

1:43:36.627 --> 1:43:38.295
Stop! That's enough.

1:43:38.545 --> 1:43:40.464
-I said that's enough!
-Okay.

1:43:41.089 --> 1:43:42.341
Can you see anything?

1:43:46.637 --> 1:43:48.680
-Get rid of them!
-Sang-ryul!

1:43:49.514 --> 1:43:52.893
Get a grip, Sang-ryul!
He isn't the one you should protect.

1:43:53.644 --> 1:43:54.645
It's these kids.

1:43:55.604 --> 1:43:56.688
We have to end it here.

1:43:57.397 --> 1:43:58.523
Don't stop me, Sang-ryul.

1:43:59.191 --> 1:44:02.235
-Don't speak that way of His Excellency!
-Sang-ryul!

1:44:03.111 --> 1:44:06.615
Have you forgotten what that bastard did?

1:44:07.741 --> 1:44:11.036
Did you forget what he did
to their parents?

1:44:11.578 --> 1:44:12.829
Come to your senses!

1:44:12.913 --> 1:44:15.874
His Excellency's history is just.

1:44:15.958 --> 1:44:17.626
What fucking history?

1:44:18.710 --> 1:44:20.921
It's just your disgusting lust for power.

1:44:21.338 --> 1:44:23.340
How long will you rewrite history?

1:44:23.423 --> 1:44:25.092
-Shut up!
-Sang-ryul!

1:44:25.217 --> 1:44:27.177
-Commie bastard.
-Commie?

1:44:28.804 --> 1:44:30.263
-Commie?
-Joo-an!

1:44:31.890 --> 1:44:35.644
My parents weren't commies!

1:44:36.937 --> 1:44:38.438
But why did you kill them?

1:44:39.064 --> 1:44:41.483
Why? Why did you kill them?

1:44:41.900 --> 1:44:43.068
Why?

1:44:45.570 --> 1:44:47.656
-Joo-an! No!
-No.

1:44:47.864 --> 1:44:49.324
Joo-an!

1:44:51.326 --> 1:44:54.538
-Jin-bae, hurry!
-Come here!

1:44:54.621 --> 1:44:55.998
Out of the way!

1:44:58.667 --> 1:45:01.461
Where is the backup?
They're already climbing the wall!

1:45:01.545 --> 1:45:02.629
Oh, they're here?

1:45:07.884 --> 1:45:08.719
That's it!

1:45:10.679 --> 1:45:12.139
It's Mi-jin Shim, right?

1:45:14.307 --> 1:45:15.142
Get her!

1:45:20.814 --> 1:45:21.898
Hurry up!

1:45:25.861 --> 1:45:26.695
Joo-an. Joo-an!

1:45:30.866 --> 1:45:33.076
-Joo-an!
-I...

1:45:33.910 --> 1:45:37.914
I really...

1:45:41.835 --> 1:45:42.669
Joo-an.

1:45:43.587 --> 1:45:46.048
Dad... Joo-an!

1:45:57.184 --> 1:45:59.186
I'm sorry, son.

1:46:05.484 --> 1:46:07.152
His Excellency is just.

1:46:08.737 --> 1:46:10.489
That's enough, Sang-ryul!

1:46:11.490 --> 1:46:15.660
Stop shooting people.

1:46:17.746 --> 1:46:18.663
Mr. Ma!

1:46:19.956 --> 1:46:22.417
What are you doing? Shoot him!

1:46:25.420 --> 1:46:27.798
Don't give me orders!

1:46:28.048 --> 1:46:28.882
What?

1:46:32.260 --> 1:46:35.680
Don't give me orders.

1:46:36.014 --> 1:46:37.015
Your gun...

1:46:44.397 --> 1:46:45.273
Don't...

1:46:47.859 --> 1:46:49.528
Don't ever give me orders again.

1:46:50.570 --> 1:46:51.446
Do you understand?

1:46:51.571 --> 1:46:54.366
-Fuck, what are they doing?
-Jin-bae.

1:47:02.040 --> 1:47:03.041
Shoot him.

1:47:04.126 --> 1:47:06.211
That is the only way you will be forgiven.

1:47:06.837 --> 1:47:09.589
Let's not set a bad example.

1:47:10.215 --> 1:47:11.466
We have to end it here.

1:47:12.926 --> 1:47:13.844
Shoot him.

1:47:15.846 --> 1:47:16.805
Move aside, Sang-ryul.

1:47:17.806 --> 1:47:18.640
Move!

1:47:24.229 --> 1:47:26.773
Don't give me orders.

1:47:43.707 --> 1:47:46.793
I promised my sister that
I would be a good police officer!

1:47:46.877 --> 1:47:48.503
Sister? You fucker!

1:47:49.212 --> 1:47:51.798
Son of a bitch. Police officer?

1:47:52.048 --> 1:47:53.008
What about you?

1:47:53.341 --> 1:47:56.553
How have you lived? Tell me already!

1:47:56.636 --> 1:47:58.930
I lived like a dog!

1:47:59.014 --> 1:48:03.268
Shouldn't a police officer
protect innocent civilians?

1:48:03.351 --> 1:48:05.478
Is that bastard innocent?

1:48:05.562 --> 1:48:08.899
Should the police protect
a murderous bastard?

1:48:08.982 --> 1:48:11.526
Get a grip, Jung-hyuk!

1:48:15.197 --> 1:48:16.239
Son of a bitch!

1:48:16.781 --> 1:48:18.700
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

1:48:19.034 --> 1:48:22.078
Don't you feel bad for your sister?

1:48:22.204 --> 1:48:23.246
Mr. Ma.

1:48:26.291 --> 1:48:29.920
Are you really going to shoot me
with that gun?

1:48:32.214 --> 1:48:33.048
Of course not.

1:48:35.175 --> 1:48:36.551
You can't die.

1:48:39.721 --> 1:48:40.847
You bastard.

1:48:41.473 --> 1:48:42.724
Till the very end,

1:48:44.643 --> 1:48:46.645
you need to live your life shamelessly

1:48:48.313 --> 1:48:53.068
so I can be provided justice
for what I did.

1:48:55.070 --> 1:48:56.905
Do you understand?

1:49:05.872 --> 1:49:07.999
Your Excellency!

1:49:09.334 --> 1:49:11.169
Your Excellency.

1:49:28.019 --> 1:49:29.104
Search inside!

1:49:30.772 --> 1:49:31.606
I'm sorry.

1:49:37.821 --> 1:49:38.738
Call an ambulance.

1:49:47.664 --> 1:49:48.707
Keep moving.

1:49:53.545 --> 1:49:55.588
Hey! Where are you going?

1:49:55.672 --> 1:49:56.798
Load him in here! Hurry!

1:49:56.881 --> 1:49:58.216
We can still save him!

1:49:58.550 --> 1:50:00.302
You have to save him, okay?

1:50:00.385 --> 1:50:01.720
Gap-sae!

1:50:02.304 --> 1:50:03.263
Wake up!

1:50:04.806 --> 1:50:07.392
Fuck, I have to be one to kill you!

1:50:08.018 --> 1:50:10.145
You can't die like this!

1:50:22.198 --> 1:50:23.116
Gap-sae!

1:50:25.285 --> 1:50:26.703
Damn it.

1:50:36.129 --> 1:50:37.380
Hey, Jung-hyuk!

1:50:43.261 --> 1:50:44.095
Good work.

1:50:44.929 --> 1:50:46.222
You got Jin-bae Kwak, right?

1:50:46.598 --> 1:50:47.432
Come here.

1:50:47.515 --> 1:50:48.350
Sir.

1:50:50.435 --> 1:50:52.562
-The situation is still ongoing.
-What?

1:50:52.645 --> 1:50:55.106
<i>You need to get over here.</i>

1:50:55.774 --> 1:50:57.817
What have you been doing?

1:50:57.901 --> 1:50:59.694
-Shut it down quickly!
-<i>Shit!</i>

1:50:59.778 --> 1:51:02.030
<i>The equipment isn't here yet!
What can I do?</i>

1:51:02.113 --> 1:51:04.824
-<i>Hurry up!</i>
-I'll handle things here.

1:51:05.241 --> 1:51:06.326
Please hurry.

1:51:08.119 --> 1:51:11.998
-His Excellency is furious.
-<i>Hurry up! Seriously!</i>

1:51:12.082 --> 1:51:13.166
<i>Hurry!</i>

1:51:13.375 --> 1:51:14.667
<i>Come quickly!</i>

1:51:14.751 --> 1:51:16.378
All right. I'll head over.

1:51:27.305 --> 1:51:28.681
I guess this is how it ends.

1:51:36.231 --> 1:51:37.440
Is this really it?

1:51:40.110 --> 1:51:41.486
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

1:51:46.783 --> 1:51:48.201
<i>I'm so ashamed.</i>

1:51:54.833 --> 1:51:56.793
That's why I'm so angry.

1:52:06.553 --> 1:52:07.387
Yong-gu.

1:52:08.680 --> 1:52:09.639
Have you eaten?

1:52:10.723 --> 1:52:12.100
Joong-seok, have you eaten?

1:52:16.563 --> 1:52:19.607
Guys, have you eaten?

1:52:20.567 --> 1:52:21.943
-Yes.
-Yes.

1:52:22.235 --> 1:52:24.988
What the hell was that? Did you get your fill?

1:52:28.783 --> 1:52:30.076
-Yes!
-Yes!

1:52:30.326 --> 1:52:33.788
Then let's give everything we have
until the very end!

1:52:33.872 --> 1:52:34.706
Jin-bae.

1:52:35.039 --> 1:52:38.751
Let's go ahead and use our weapons now!

1:52:38.835 --> 1:52:41.421
Fine, do what you want!

1:52:41.796 --> 1:52:43.798
Now, charge!

1:52:53.933 --> 1:52:55.518
Hurry up!

1:53:25.048 --> 1:53:27.050
What is going on? Are they on it again?

1:53:27.133 --> 1:53:29.469
Don't just watch! Help out!

1:53:30.386 --> 1:53:31.679
Is this the only entrance?

1:53:31.846 --> 1:53:33.515
<i>-Hey, Officer Park.</i>
-Yes?

1:53:33.890 --> 1:53:35.517
Is anything there?

1:53:37.393 --> 1:53:38.686
Over there!

1:54:10.677 --> 1:54:12.804
-I'll take your bag.
-It's fine. Let's go.

1:54:30.029 --> 1:54:31.239
Son of a bitch!

1:54:33.449 --> 1:54:35.702
Son of a bitch!

1:54:41.457 --> 1:54:43.585
What is this, you fucker?

1:54:44.085 --> 1:54:44.919
Die!

1:54:48.673 --> 1:54:49.757
Die!

1:55:01.227 --> 1:55:03.479
There's no time.

1:55:03.563 --> 1:55:06.024
Fuck, there's no time!

1:55:10.904 --> 1:55:11.738
Die. <i>You're in danger!</i>

1:55:19.746 --> 1:55:22.415
Jin-bae, what are you doing?

1:55:22.749 --> 1:55:24.542
Hurry up and kill him!

1:55:29.505 --> 1:55:30.882
-Now!
-<i>No!</i>

1:55:40.058 --> 1:55:41.184
Jin-bae!

1:55:44.479 --> 1:55:45.897
-Officer Park!
-I'm okay.

1:55:46.147 --> 1:55:47.523
-Get out of there.
-Are you okay?

1:56:06.376 --> 1:56:07.627
What are you doing?

1:56:08.211 --> 1:56:09.045
Shoot!

1:56:09.879 --> 1:56:12.131
Hurry up and shoot! There's no time!

1:56:22.225 --> 1:56:24.268
<i>It's been 26 years!</i>

1:56:24.352 --> 1:56:25.937
<i>Twenty-six years!</i>

1:56:27.146 --> 1:56:32.527
If we lose this chance,
we'll never have another!

1:56:34.070 --> 1:56:35.947
<i>Don't be sorry.</i>

1:56:40.410 --> 1:56:42.787
<i>Don't be ashamed.</i>

1:56:45.081 --> 1:56:48.584
Don't blame the fucking world!

1:56:52.255 --> 1:56:56.634
Let's just shake everything off!

1:57:08.479 --> 1:57:09.522
Get in position!

1:57:11.149 --> 1:57:13.317
-What are you doing?
-Hey, punk!

1:57:13.568 --> 1:57:15.403
We already did everything we can! Let go!

1:57:15.486 --> 1:57:16.654
If I don't stop her,

1:57:16.904 --> 1:57:18.781
you and I are both dead.

1:57:20.158 --> 1:57:21.200
Captain!

1:57:28.541 --> 1:57:29.375
No.

1:57:30.293 --> 1:57:31.252
It's dangerous.

1:57:32.670 --> 1:57:33.880
You're in danger!

1:57:34.213 --> 1:57:35.214
Don't think.

1:57:35.673 --> 1:57:36.841
You will only lose if you think.

1:57:51.481 --> 1:57:52.648
Mi-jin Shim!

1:57:53.274 --> 1:57:54.484
Drop the gun!

1:57:58.488 --> 1:57:59.614
Let's...

1:58:01.824 --> 1:58:03.367
get this over with quickly.

1:58:05.661 --> 1:58:07.872
Then we can go to the movies
like normal people.

1:58:09.874 --> 1:58:11.542
We can even go to an amusement park.

1:58:11.626 --> 1:58:12.710
Fuck.

1:58:19.634 --> 1:58:22.762
So hurry up and fucking shoot!

1:58:44.367 --> 1:58:46.035
Mi-jin!

1:58:47.411 --> 1:58:48.538
Jin-bae.

1:58:51.207 --> 1:58:52.333
Fuck!

1:58:52.834 --> 1:58:57.213
Think of your father who burned to death!

1:58:58.714 --> 1:59:00.216
I'm happy I met you.

2:00:05.865 --> 2:00:09.702
THIS MORNING

2:00:15.082 --> 2:00:15.917
At ease.

2:00:19.629 --> 2:00:20.713
We're done, so let's go.

2:00:29.096 --> 2:00:30.097
Let's go.
