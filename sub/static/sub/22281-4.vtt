MAN: (ON RADIO)
The National Weather Service

00:14.600 --> 00:16.667
has issued
a fire weather message.

00:16.833 --> 00:20.467
This is for the northern
and interior Seward Peninsula.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.567
Moderate to strong gusty winds

00:22.700 --> 00:24.367
will increase tonight
through Wednesday.

00:24.467 --> 00:25.533
That's not gonna be any good.

00:25.633 --> 00:27.433
And it says,
"Red Flag Warning,"

00:27.500 --> 00:30.000
means that conditions
are occurring or will occur

00:30.067 --> 00:34.300
which could lead
to the development of large
and dangerous fires.

00:34.400 --> 00:35.467
Sounds like
we're stuck at home.

00:35.533 --> 00:37.167
-AGNES: Red flag.
-Red flag.

00:39.433 --> 00:40.767
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:02.000 --> 01:03.100
CHIP: Like,
we're stuck at home.

01:03.233 --> 01:04.767
-AGNES: Red flag.
-Red flag, I know.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.333
For three days.

01:06.433 --> 01:07.967
I should go get firewood

01:08.033 --> 01:10.000
and we should go
get a couple of days'
worth of something to eat.

01:10.067 --> 01:12.367
-Either caribou,
or a few ducks.
-Yep.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.933
NARRATOR: The Hailstone family
spends their summer
living in Kiwalik,

01:16.000 --> 01:18.833
away from their home
in their native village
of Noorvik.

01:19.367 --> 01:21.933
This nomadic lifestyle allows
them to live off the land

01:22.267 --> 01:24.967
and stockpile resources
for the harsh winter ahead.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.967
We got to start tying down
the tents and the tepees

01:30.033 --> 01:31.400
-and the kitchen.
-Yeah.

01:31.467 --> 01:33.300
We got to make sure
everything is put up.

01:33.967 --> 01:35.333
CHIP: We got
40-mile-an-hour winds

01:35.400 --> 01:37.267
coming in for
the next three days.

01:37.333 --> 01:38.600
The next three days
we're gonna need heat,

01:38.667 --> 01:40.133
we're gonna need
some fresh meat,

01:40.200 --> 01:42.900
and we're gonna need to just
basically secure our stuff.

01:43.033 --> 01:44.967
These are tents.
They can just blow away

01:45.033 --> 01:47.733
and, um, they can end up
in the river, they can end up
in the willows.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.700
They can end up destroyed.
We gotta get busy.

01:49.767 --> 01:51.700
That's really what
we got to do. Ah!

01:52.433 --> 01:53.800
You guys listen
to the weather report?

01:54.333 --> 01:57.733
We have a 40-mile-an-hour
wind warning with gusts,

01:57.800 --> 01:59.700
so we're gonna just
hunker down for a couple days.

01:59.867 --> 02:01.900
It ain't gonna be any good
to go out in the ocean,

02:01.967 --> 02:04.333
it ain't gonna be
any good to, uh, have fires.

02:04.967 --> 02:06.367
Probably ain't gonna be
any good to fish right now,

02:06.433 --> 02:08.333
'cause it's gonna be
such a low tide
with the north wind.

02:08.467 --> 02:10.033
Me and Jon are gonna take off.

02:10.100 --> 02:12.533
We're gonna go look
for the ducks, geese,
whatever's in the river.

02:12.600 --> 02:14.433
-AGNES: Few more logs.
-Yep, a few more logs.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.600
And you ladies
can just tidy up camp.

02:16.667 --> 02:19.033
Anything that's loose
and stuff has to be picked up.

02:19.100 --> 02:21.100
Anything that's up
on the rack up there,

02:21.167 --> 02:23.200
that's gonna have
to be nailed down
or secured.

02:23.267 --> 02:24.433
All right.

02:24.933 --> 02:27.433
Well, I'm gonna go
get ready for boating.

02:27.500 --> 02:29.367
I gotta go get wood,
I gotta go get meat.

02:29.433 --> 02:30.900
They're gonna
secure the camp around here

02:30.967 --> 02:33.000
and make sure that
everything's picked up
and put away,

02:33.067 --> 02:34.100
and nothing's gonna blow away.

02:34.167 --> 02:35.167
'Cause, uh, we can't just

02:35.233 --> 02:36.800
go to the store
and replace things

02:36.867 --> 02:38.433
and, uh, it's just on us.

02:42.467 --> 02:43.967
-Carol.
-CAROL: Yeah.

02:44.033 --> 02:46.233
I'm gonna come in
with these big rocks, okay?

02:46.300 --> 02:48.833
-Yeah.
-They're what I'm gonna
be tying your tent down with.

02:50.667 --> 02:51.900
(CAROL SPEAKING)

02:51.967 --> 02:54.500
Yep, it's gonna get
really windy here pretty soon.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.933
I'm pretty much just gonna
tie the whole tepee down

02:58.000 --> 03:01.933
and prepare for
the real high winds
that are coming.

03:02.233 --> 03:03.700
How fast is the wind gonna be?

03:03.767 --> 03:08.467
It's gonna be like
35 to 45 miles per hour-gusts.

03:08.533 --> 03:09.967
The cold is coming.

03:10.833 --> 03:12.667
Almost like back to winter.

03:13.033 --> 03:14.300
So I'm gonna
use these right here

03:14.367 --> 03:15.967
to hold you girls' tent down.

03:16.033 --> 03:18.633
If it start to get funny
or untied, you girls fix it

03:18.700 --> 03:20.800
to where it won't come,
just come off.

03:21.167 --> 03:22.500
It should hold.

03:22.567 --> 03:24.333
We have to
always just be prepared

03:24.433 --> 03:26.067
because once your shelter
start blowing

03:26.133 --> 03:29.367
it's pretty hard
to keep all your stuff
dry, clean, and together.

03:29.467 --> 03:30.967
So we're just trying
to make sure

03:31.033 --> 03:34.100
we have food security,
our shelter is secured

03:34.167 --> 03:35.867
and, um, we have enough heat.

03:35.933 --> 03:38.367
-There!
-Now fix it here.

03:38.433 --> 03:39.733
That should hold.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.700
I'm gonna take
the chainsaw for wood.

03:44.800 --> 03:46.767
Looks like you're ready
for geese and ducks.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.233
Let's see what
we can come home with.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.100
I'm sure we can
fill the boat with something.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.567
Looks like
the wind's already picking up.

03:53.633 --> 03:55.033
It's kind of nasty.

03:55.100 --> 03:57.433
We've gotten my son Jon
to go boating with me today.

03:57.500 --> 03:58.967
We've got firewood to collect

03:59.033 --> 04:00.933
and we've got
some meat to secure.

04:01.233 --> 04:02.800
We know the weather's coming.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.700
We know what to do
to prepare for it
and we get with it.

04:04.833 --> 04:06.500
What'll kill ya
isn't the weather,

04:06.567 --> 04:08.000
it's not being
prepared for it.

04:08.467 --> 04:09.967
And if you don't
prepare yourself

04:10.033 --> 04:11.900
and you don't go get
the things that you need
before it happens,

04:11.967 --> 04:13.800
you're gonna have to do it
while it's happening,

04:13.900 --> 04:15.133
and that's when
you can get nailed.

04:20.833 --> 04:23.067
GLENN: There's always lots
to see out here.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.733
There's work to do,
but there's also
just a lot to learn.

04:32.233 --> 04:33.967
I'm getting ready to go out
and cut some firewood

04:34.033 --> 04:35.333
in a new area today.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.233
The ice has just melted off
the lake and broken up.

04:39.633 --> 04:41.267
So I can use
the canoe to get out

04:41.333 --> 04:44.700
and access an area
where I don't normally
cut firewood in the winter...

04:46.567 --> 04:47.967
And also go see
how the fishing is

04:48.033 --> 04:49.267
over on the other side
of the lake.

04:50.400 --> 04:52.033
I don't do much fishing
all winter long,

04:52.100 --> 04:53.800
but in the springtime,
once the ice breaks up,

04:53.867 --> 04:55.733
that's when the pike
are spawning in the shallows.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.300
A good time to go fishing.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.000
Feels nice.

05:05.133 --> 05:08.167
During the winter,
I deplete the firewood
close by my cabin.

05:08.567 --> 05:09.900
I'm always cutting
close by the cabin,

05:09.967 --> 05:11.867
because I have to drag
all the wood home in a sled.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.900
This time of year,
I can get out in the canoe

05:15.967 --> 05:18.100
and I can access an area
further away from my camp

05:18.167 --> 05:20.667
so that I don't deplete the
firewood right around camp.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.067
Best thing
about this time of year is

05:26.133 --> 05:28.867
everything coming back to life
after a long winter.

05:30.600 --> 05:31.900
Great to be
out canoeing again,

05:31.967 --> 05:34.000
because it's a different way
of getting around.

05:34.367 --> 05:35.733
See the world
from a different perspective.

05:40.767 --> 05:41.800
Just looking along the shore.

05:41.867 --> 05:43.367
Looks like some deadwood
right up here.

05:43.533 --> 05:45.533
Think I'll go ashore
right around in here.

05:52.533 --> 05:54.533
I've never cut firewood
right here before.

05:58.233 --> 06:01.833
I still use a lot of firewood
in the summer and the winter,
all seasons.

06:01.933 --> 06:03.167
If I don't cook
on the wood stove,

06:03.233 --> 06:05.933
then I burn firewood outside
when it gets too hot.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.533
I have to burn
an outdoor fire to cook

06:07.600 --> 06:08.800
and that uses even more wood.

06:18.733 --> 06:22.033
This is a twisted tree,
like most of 'em out here,

06:22.167 --> 06:23.700
which makes cutting harder.

06:24.633 --> 06:27.467
'Cause the grain
is not straight,
the grain's spiral.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.267
But that's the way it goes.

06:31.100 --> 06:32.433
Things are twisted up here.

06:48.633 --> 06:52.000
Drier wood actually produces
more heat for the cabin,

06:52.067 --> 06:54.600
because if you
cut a green tree, it'll burn,

06:54.667 --> 06:56.933
but it takes a lot of heat

06:57.000 --> 06:59.300
just to evaporate
the moisture out of it.

07:02.233 --> 07:03.900
This is gonna
provide me with heat.

07:03.967 --> 07:05.667
I'll be able
to cook my food on it.

07:06.233 --> 07:08.633
I'll be able
to heat hot water with it.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.000
It's just converting it
into another source of energy.

07:12.600 --> 07:14.100
I'm gonna cut down
another tree

07:14.167 --> 07:16.000
and get
another couple of logs.

07:23.267 --> 07:24.667
JESSIE: This is Alaska,
you know.

07:24.733 --> 07:26.100
You're supposed to be free.

07:26.167 --> 07:28.133
This is the last frontier.
I'm gonna treat it like it.

07:40.967 --> 07:42.433
NARRATOR: Along
the Tanana River,

07:42.500 --> 07:44.100
Jessie Holmes
relies on fishing

07:44.167 --> 07:46.567
to feed himself
and his team of sled dogs.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.167
With the chum salmon run
in full swing,

07:50.233 --> 07:52.333
Jessie must get
his fishnet into the river,

07:52.400 --> 07:55.500
or risk losing out
on vital food and protein.

07:56.833 --> 07:58.167
JESSIE: I see people
got their nets out.

07:58.233 --> 07:59.300
I can't just sit easy.

07:59.367 --> 08:00.800
I need to catch
some fish right now,

08:00.867 --> 08:02.667
feed my dogs and feed myself.

08:03.100 --> 08:05.867
I'm gonna go
take a look at this net

08:07.133 --> 08:10.100
and hope it's not in
as bad of shape
as I remember it is.

08:10.267 --> 08:13.133
I got this old net,
I'm not too excited
about using it, you know,

08:13.200 --> 08:14.867
but I'm gonna mend it
and repair it

08:14.933 --> 08:15.967
and make the best out of it.

08:16.033 --> 08:18.000
Try to get the most life
I can out of this.

08:18.167 --> 08:19.167
So, there's no telling

08:19.233 --> 08:21.433
how long
this is gonna take me,

08:21.500 --> 08:23.633
'cause this thing
is in pretty bad shape.

08:24.467 --> 08:25.733
But I'm that kind of person,

08:25.800 --> 08:27.467
I won't throw
something like this away.

08:27.933 --> 08:29.700
It might not be perfect,

08:29.767 --> 08:32.967
but you see there's
still a lot of mesh left
that can catch a lot of fish.

08:33.333 --> 08:36.267
This is not something that I
enjoy dealing with, fishnets.

08:36.333 --> 08:39.067
It's a hell of a task
for me to have to
deal with on my own.

08:39.167 --> 08:42.733
But sitting back at home
talking about fishing
doesn't catch fish.

08:42.833 --> 08:45.033
Gonna get nothing
if I don't try, so...

08:45.533 --> 08:48.700
Getting out here, making
the best out of what you got,

08:48.767 --> 08:50.300
is what's gonna
catch fish for me.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.067
Like, a new net
would be pretty nice probably.

08:54.167 --> 08:55.867
I don't think
I've ever had a new net.

08:55.933 --> 08:57.800
I just use whatever
I can get my hands on.

08:58.000 --> 09:01.000
I'm all about
not relying on others
and relying on myself,

09:01.067 --> 09:02.367
that's why
I live this lifestyle.

09:02.433 --> 09:03.867
This lifestyle, I value it.

09:03.967 --> 09:07.400
It's important to me
to be truly subsistence.

09:08.733 --> 09:11.500
All right, so now
I've got this net mended

09:12.000 --> 09:15.533
'til the best of what
I want to do it, you know?

09:15.633 --> 09:18.000
The amount of time I have
to spend on this project,

09:18.067 --> 09:19.200
and it turned out a lot better

09:19.267 --> 09:20.667
than I thought
it was going to.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.267
Actually looks like
a fishnet again.

09:24.567 --> 09:26.433
I think I'm gonna
go right here, honestly.

09:29.700 --> 09:31.933
Fishing around here
goes on a schedule.

09:32.033 --> 09:35.033
I have a 42-hour period to see
what's out there in the water,

09:35.100 --> 09:36.667
and with any hopes

09:36.733 --> 09:38.400
there's still gonna be
some king salmon out there.

09:38.467 --> 09:40.600
Get a few kings put up,
you know?

09:40.667 --> 09:42.067
The net's going out
pretty good.

09:43.033 --> 09:44.367
Get this out of the way.

09:44.567 --> 09:45.900
Get my buoy in there.

09:47.833 --> 09:48.933
Damn.

09:50.600 --> 09:51.833
I'd say this is good.

09:53.067 --> 09:55.867
Went right into the eddy line,
that's where I wanted to go.

09:56.067 --> 09:59.333
It would be really ideal
if the fish come through
here good,

10:00.300 --> 10:02.000
because it's right next
to my fish camp.

10:04.700 --> 10:08.033
Gotta make sure
this net's not tangled up
and snagged up,

10:08.100 --> 10:09.700
so that it can get
as much coverage...

10:10.667 --> 10:13.900
And it looks like
if these fish are
comin' out of this eddy,

10:13.967 --> 10:16.900
heading up towards here,
that they'll come into here.

10:19.067 --> 10:20.500
Well, things went good.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.233
Not often you get so lucky.

10:22.733 --> 10:25.133
I'm gonna leave it here,
let it do its job

10:25.200 --> 10:27.633
and hope there's
some fish in there.

10:31.167 --> 10:32.767
SUE: Mine is not
to question why,

10:32.833 --> 10:34.267
but to find the solution.

10:34.333 --> 10:35.567
Thinking about it
doesn't solve it,

10:35.633 --> 10:36.800
getting in there does.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.467
Great.

10:43.767 --> 10:45.433
Like I didn't have
enough problems.

10:45.500 --> 10:47.167
The generator is down again.

10:47.333 --> 10:49.467
-(CLICKS)
-Boom, boom, boom,
boom. Oh, golly.

10:50.300 --> 10:51.900
Hey, this is me.
Can anybody hear me?

10:52.367 --> 10:53.767
Nope.

10:53.833 --> 10:56.600
NARRATOR: A C-46 supply plane
will soon arrive in Kavik,

10:56.667 --> 10:58.433
bringing Sue Aikens
new equipment

10:58.500 --> 11:00.400
and 12,000 pounds of food.

11:00.767 --> 11:02.467
With her generator down,

11:02.533 --> 11:04.867
Sue is unable
to communicate with the pilot

11:04.933 --> 11:07.000
and restoring power
is a priority.

11:07.367 --> 11:09.300
SUE: One of
the biggest factors

11:09.367 --> 11:13.167
to getting Kavik back up
and running for business,
food.

11:13.433 --> 11:14.433
(CLATTERS)

11:15.633 --> 11:17.033
Because of the accident,

11:17.100 --> 11:19.367
when we went from winter
to spring-summer,

11:19.567 --> 11:22.233
nobody was here
to run the gens to
keep the food frozen.

11:22.367 --> 11:23.733
It all went bad.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.300
All the food got thrown away.

11:25.633 --> 11:26.833
Winds are picking up.

11:26.900 --> 11:30.100
I've got the plane coming
with everything on it.

11:30.200 --> 11:32.567
And I can't tell him he's got
a 20-mile-an-hour crosswind.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.933
Got to have power.
It's just that simple.

11:35.700 --> 11:37.033
Jesse, ya in the shop?

11:37.133 --> 11:38.133
-JESSE: Yeah.
-All right.

11:38.267 --> 11:39.767
Gonna kick over the 40.

11:41.800 --> 11:42.967
Give it a second.

11:54.167 --> 11:55.933
Damn it. Motherfucker.

11:58.733 --> 11:59.800
(SUE SPEAKING)

11:59.900 --> 12:01.400
Okay, you want me
to grab that?

12:02.167 --> 12:04.200
-SUE: Yeah,
I can't lift that high.
-Okay.

12:04.267 --> 12:05.533
SUE: Careful,
that pipe might be hot.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.100
(JESSE GROANS)

12:08.233 --> 12:10.433
Obviously taped it shut
for the snow,

12:10.500 --> 12:14.033
and the minute you do it and
you didn't check everything,
guess who's at fault?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.567
Little bit of carbon maybe.

12:17.833 --> 12:18.967
Oh, yeah.

12:19.167 --> 12:20.500
SUE: Let's go
and try this again.

12:20.733 --> 12:22.767
Press your yellow
and then wait.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.433
Hopefully, this will be better
than the last time.

12:32.400 --> 12:34.000
-Let's go take a look.
-JESSE: All right.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.000
SUE: We're gonna go check
the volts and hertz metres

12:36.067 --> 12:37.533
and it gives you an idea

12:37.600 --> 12:39.500
of where
that generator is running.
It's the blood pressure.

12:40.800 --> 12:43.333
All right. So here you go.

12:43.600 --> 12:46.000
-It's at 117, 18 over 61.
-Mmm.

12:46.067 --> 12:47.933
-Not perfect, well
within the guidelines.
-Okay.

12:48.067 --> 12:49.833
-(CLICKS)
-But here we go.

12:49.900 --> 12:51.233
Radio check, Kavik.

12:51.433 --> 12:53.800
When I do that,
I can talk to the airplanes.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.133
Now I can tell 'em,

12:55.200 --> 12:56.833
"Hey, we've got some
volatile winds out here."

13:00.000 --> 13:02.300
NARRATOR: Since
returning to camp
after her injury,

13:02.367 --> 13:05.967
Sue has worked to reopen Kavik
as a fuel supply station.

13:06.300 --> 13:09.733
But having lost
thousands of dollars
worth of food and freezers,

13:10.767 --> 13:13.300
Kavik is not available yet
for lodging,

13:13.400 --> 13:15.900
which is Sue's main source
of revenue for the year.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.000
I've got
the delivery sorted out.

13:18.067 --> 13:20.467
It's... But it's gonna be
coming in on the C-46.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.600
Big old plane.

13:21.733 --> 13:24.233
The delivery plane
bringing in my goods,

13:24.300 --> 13:28.067
this is a 1945 war bird,
tail-dragging plane.

13:28.133 --> 13:30.400
Twelve thousand pounds on it.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.600
Bigger than your average bear.

13:32.667 --> 13:34.967
That runway has to be good.

13:35.333 --> 13:36.633
My limitations right now,

13:36.700 --> 13:39.200
I cannot do the work
on the Bobcat.

13:39.300 --> 13:41.500
Are you comfortable
getting in there

13:41.567 --> 13:42.967
with what I showed you
and how it works?

13:43.067 --> 13:44.333
-Are you comfortable?
-Yeah.

13:44.400 --> 13:45.367
-All right.
-Yeah, I should be
able to do it.

13:45.433 --> 13:46.767
All right, well,
let's get you in.

13:46.833 --> 13:48.533
I need that runway done right,

13:48.600 --> 13:50.367
I need it done quick
and I need it done now.

13:50.433 --> 13:51.767
-Okay.
-So I'll follow...

13:51.833 --> 13:53.833
Yeah, if you wanna
start 'er up and,
uh, go with me,

13:53.900 --> 13:55.900
-I'll show you exactly
what I'm looking for.
-Okay.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.933
SUE: I've called my nephew in,

13:59.033 --> 14:01.300
so I can get help
getting these chores done.

14:01.967 --> 14:04.667
Once I make
that committed choice
that I need help,

14:04.733 --> 14:07.633
I've got to get
somebody out here
and that's just the way it is,

14:07.700 --> 14:09.300
then I don't dwell on that.

14:09.367 --> 14:11.400
I dwell on, "Okay,
what can we do together?
What can we accomplish?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.067
"How can I make him
go do something else

14:13.133 --> 14:14.700
"while I can do something
over here?"

14:15.567 --> 14:17.233
Getting the food,
getting the freezers.

14:17.333 --> 14:18.933
Absolutely the biggest piece,

14:19.000 --> 14:22.167
the last piece in making Kavik
open for business again.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.467
GLENN: Time passes slowly.

14:29.567 --> 14:31.700
Things change slowly,
but they continue to change.

14:40.967 --> 14:43.467
This time of year,
the pike are spawning
in the shallows.

14:43.900 --> 14:46.700
There's a grassy area
just up around the corner
where I might find some.

14:47.633 --> 14:49.433
I haven't caught
a pike yet this year.

14:49.533 --> 14:51.200
Never know exactly
what you're gonna find,

14:51.267 --> 14:53.200
but I'm hoping
for some good fishing today.

14:53.600 --> 14:56.267
This is one of my
favourite spots, right in
where these trees are.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.667
Living out here,
you got to learn a lot

14:58.733 --> 15:02.133
about what's going on
at different places
at different times.

15:02.200 --> 15:05.100
One thing I've learned
is that if I want to get
a fish at this time of year,

15:05.167 --> 15:06.500
I go over to this inlet.

15:06.800 --> 15:09.600
Fish close to the grass,
that's where the pike
are spawning right now.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.467
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

15:14.767 --> 15:16.400
There's a big one right here.

15:18.067 --> 15:19.833
There's a real
fat pike right here,

15:19.900 --> 15:21.800
I just saw it
right beside the canoe.

15:24.367 --> 15:26.033
I see one right there.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.533
Yep, yep.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.333
Let's see if I can
get him interested in this.

15:35.133 --> 15:36.300
There's one chasing it.

15:42.833 --> 15:44.167
Whoop, whoop, whoop.

15:45.533 --> 15:46.933
Yep, I got it.

15:48.133 --> 15:50.000
I got a pike
hooked on here.

15:50.067 --> 15:51.300
Oh, it's a nice, big one,
pulling me out.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.100
It's a nice, big pike.

15:55.467 --> 15:58.200
I got to be careful.
I don't want this one
to get away.

15:59.067 --> 16:00.800
Got to watch out for those...

16:00.933 --> 16:02.933
Got to watch out
for those teeth.

16:03.900 --> 16:05.133
Pike have big teeth.

16:07.767 --> 16:10.467
Here. Got it!

16:10.533 --> 16:11.933
Look at that fish.

16:12.567 --> 16:13.567
Wow.

16:13.933 --> 16:16.133
Ah! That's gonna be lunch
and dinner.

16:26.633 --> 16:29.333
CHIP: We're not quitters.
We don't slack.

16:29.767 --> 16:31.667
We bend with the times,
we have to adapt.

16:35.400 --> 16:36.600
(JON SPEAKING)

16:37.300 --> 16:38.633
(CHIP SPEAKING)

16:39.300 --> 16:40.400
Me and Jon are going out,

16:40.467 --> 16:41.833
trying to get
a little bit of meat put up,

16:41.900 --> 16:43.467
get a little bit of firewood.

16:43.600 --> 16:47.100
We've got
a pretty strong wind already,
maybe 25 miles an hour.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.633
We can already see
the white caps,

16:48.700 --> 16:50.267
so going up and down the river

16:50.333 --> 16:52.500
isn't a very good idea
here pretty soon.

16:52.900 --> 16:56.267
We got a stronger wind
coming over the next few days

16:56.333 --> 16:58.067
and we want to be
a little more prepared
than we are,

16:58.133 --> 17:00.200
and so we're trying
to beat this.

17:00.767 --> 17:03.000
Once we get it down,
we'll be good,

17:03.067 --> 17:04.767
but we ain't got it down yet.

17:09.533 --> 17:11.133
I'm gonna go off over here
and go get a log.

17:11.200 --> 17:12.800
JON: Okay.

17:12.900 --> 17:15.567
I'm gonna go see
if I can score some birds
with the shotgun or .22.

17:15.633 --> 17:17.467
There you go.

17:17.567 --> 17:20.700
We got through to Egg Island,
where we go pick a lot of eggs
and see a lot of birds.

17:21.867 --> 17:23.600
So I'm gonna try and
go and sneak over

17:23.667 --> 17:26.100
and if I can't get
close enough with the shotgun,

17:26.167 --> 17:28.767
I'll use the .22 for
a little longer range.

17:29.767 --> 17:31.667
Let's go do some bird hunting.

17:37.833 --> 17:41.400
It's not
the ideal hunting conditions
because it's really windy.

17:46.367 --> 17:47.867
I see geese out here.

18:10.400 --> 18:11.633
Aw, damn.

18:11.733 --> 18:13.600
Aw, damn wind.

18:13.700 --> 18:15.667
Took a few shots.
They're all misses.

18:15.733 --> 18:17.667
It's kinda hard
shooting in this wind.

18:17.800 --> 18:19.867
Even my hat
keeps trying to fly off.

18:21.633 --> 18:22.933
So I'm just gonna take a walk.

18:23.000 --> 18:25.000
See if we can get some
of these at the point.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.833
Everything here
doesn't want to die.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.633
It doesn't
give itself up easily.

18:29.700 --> 18:31.533
Usually, there's a chase
you have to get into.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.633
You have to go chase them down
if you really want them.

18:36.967 --> 18:38.367
I see an eider over here.

18:38.433 --> 18:40.800
It's kinda close to the edge.
Looks like I'll be able to go

18:40.867 --> 18:42.333
and get it
if I can get close enough.

18:56.167 --> 18:57.433
(GUNSHOT)

18:59.400 --> 19:00.767
I got him.

19:03.367 --> 19:04.700
I got him.

19:06.700 --> 19:08.133
I got the eider with a .22.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.967
He was too far
for the shotgun, but...

19:10.033 --> 19:12.267
He's out here floating.
Let's go grab him.

19:12.867 --> 19:14.667
Right on. A common eider.

19:15.167 --> 19:16.300
Whoo!

19:16.467 --> 19:18.267
Well, got one king eider,
not bad.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.833
Got it with the .22,
it's kind of too far
with the shotgun.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.167
Kinda scared everything
off the island, so...

19:23.400 --> 19:26.767
Head back down to the boat
and see if I can see
anything on the way back.

19:32.567 --> 19:35.200
Getting pretty windy.
It's gonna get dark
and cold soon,

19:35.267 --> 19:37.367
so I'll be on
my way back home.

19:38.033 --> 19:40.700
My dad's going to be happy.
My sisters will be happy.

19:45.867 --> 19:47.833
GLENN: Experience,
gaining knowledge,

19:47.967 --> 19:49.800
learning how to do things
more efficiently.

19:49.867 --> 19:51.233
That's what it's about.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.400
I just gotta
load up the firewood.

20:03.733 --> 20:05.967
I got considerably
more wood here
than I could fit

20:06.033 --> 20:08.100
in my little sled that
I pull home in the winter.

20:08.167 --> 20:11.000
I'll be able to bring it all
in one load with this canoe.

20:13.333 --> 20:15.300
The canoe allows me to
get out a little further away

20:15.367 --> 20:17.033
than I would normally go
to cut firewood.

20:17.100 --> 20:20.033
I can get it back easier,
so I can go a little further.

20:20.100 --> 20:22.600
I got more than twice
of what I'd fit in my sled.

20:24.367 --> 20:26.067
Nice little pile of firewood.

20:28.300 --> 20:31.300
So I got some materials here
to build a friction fire.

20:31.367 --> 20:34.100
It's just a little
breezy out here for this.

20:34.167 --> 20:35.667
I don't know
if I'm gonna be able to do it.

20:38.033 --> 20:40.667
This is just a fungus,
grows on certain trees,

20:40.733 --> 20:43.433
and I'm just using it in order
to make a little nest here.

20:44.867 --> 20:47.767
It will allow
a small ember to grow larger

20:47.833 --> 20:49.700
and then I can add
other materials to it

20:49.767 --> 20:51.500
and eventually
get a fire, hopefully.

20:51.867 --> 20:54.567
Technique I'm gonna
try right now is a bow drill.

20:54.633 --> 20:56.600
It's a very small bow
that I made,

20:56.667 --> 20:59.533
very compact,
very small spindle.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.067
It drills a hole,
which you start with a knife.

21:02.367 --> 21:04.300
It drills
further into the wood

21:04.533 --> 21:06.800
and the friction
produces smoke.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.567
Two pieces of
poplar wood rubbing together.

21:17.000 --> 21:19.600
Uh. See smoke, that's good.

21:20.333 --> 21:21.500
Good sign.

21:23.367 --> 21:24.767
I've got a little ember.

21:26.133 --> 21:27.267
(GROANS)

21:28.367 --> 21:31.500
And I need it
to grow big enough
to actually get a flame.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.500
It's real challenging
in this wind,

21:33.567 --> 21:37.800
but I'm gonna try
and transfer it into
this fungus here.

21:38.733 --> 21:40.633
(SIGHS) Come on.

21:44.533 --> 21:45.800
It's looking good.

21:45.900 --> 21:47.633
(SNIFFLES) Getting more smoke.

22:05.467 --> 22:06.867
There it goes.

22:06.933 --> 22:09.067
Fire. Yeah!

22:09.133 --> 22:10.133
Look at that.

22:11.933 --> 22:13.233
Time to cook my fish.

22:17.200 --> 22:19.300
There's a considerable
amount of food here.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.167
Look at that fish.

22:25.267 --> 22:27.167
It's all about
taking advantage
of the opportunities

22:27.233 --> 22:29.100
and in order to take advantage
of opportunities,

22:29.167 --> 22:32.000
you have to learn the country
and you have to learn
where things are happening

22:32.067 --> 22:33.200
and when they're happening at.

22:33.267 --> 22:34.767
There's a time
and a place for everything

22:34.833 --> 22:36.933
and if you miss it,
you're out of luck.

22:37.567 --> 22:40.900
You got to be on the ball.
You got to know where to go
and when to go there.

22:44.600 --> 22:45.633
Mmm.

22:47.067 --> 22:48.300
Tasty pike.

22:54.567 --> 22:57.300
JESSIE: I try to set my
mentality up to get it done.

22:57.900 --> 22:59.600
If I set a goal,
I have to do it.

23:01.767 --> 23:02.967
Load up, buddy.

23:04.467 --> 23:07.533
NARRATOR: In Nenana,
the chum salmon run has begun.

23:07.833 --> 23:09.667
Jessie has returned
to check the net

23:09.733 --> 23:11.600
in hopes
of harvesting enough fish

23:11.667 --> 23:14.500
to feed himself and his dogs
through the months ahead.

23:15.533 --> 23:18.600
Fishing here is monitored
in openers and closures.

23:18.700 --> 23:21.567
You know, I only got
42 more hours of this period

23:21.633 --> 23:23.667
that's gonna be open
and I'd like to get some fish.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.967
Catching some grass.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.967
Over here, there might
be one, or two. (STRAINS)

23:30.333 --> 23:32.800
Got some sticks.
That's birch bark.

23:35.200 --> 23:37.467
I haven't got any fish and
I'm getting to the end of it.

23:37.533 --> 23:39.367
Doesn't look like
there's any in there.

23:39.567 --> 23:42.633
What I'm gonna do,
this thing isn't catching
here, you know.

23:42.700 --> 23:44.433
I'm gonna move it.

23:44.500 --> 23:46.267
I don't think
this is the best spot.

23:48.667 --> 23:50.367
If I'm gonna
catch some fish right now,

23:50.433 --> 23:52.567
I need to put this
in an optimal location.

23:52.633 --> 23:55.133
Time's wasting.
Okay, I got my anchor out.

23:55.200 --> 23:56.400
That'll hold my boat.

23:56.533 --> 23:59.233
Now it's time to go look
for a new spot to put this.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.933
It really isn't cost effective
to be driving like,

24:07.033 --> 24:09.400
you know, four or five miles
up and down the river

24:09.467 --> 24:10.900
and not be catching any fish,

24:10.967 --> 24:14.433
but what you got to look at
is like the end of the season.

24:14.500 --> 24:15.833
You need
to figure this all up.

24:15.967 --> 24:17.500
Well, I spent this much
in gas,

24:17.567 --> 24:22.200
but I got 3,500-4,000 fish
put up for my dogs

24:22.300 --> 24:25.667
and I got my winter supply
of fish taken care of.

24:26.767 --> 24:30.100
All right, I came
a little further upriver here
to check this spot out.

24:30.967 --> 24:33.467
This is the spot. This is it.

24:33.533 --> 24:35.033
I see markings from it.

24:35.100 --> 24:38.033
I see from the old poles and
a piece of rope hanging here

24:38.100 --> 24:40.067
and what I thought was
a little post. This is a...

24:40.133 --> 24:41.533
This is a spot.

24:42.433 --> 24:46.367
Nothing marks a fishing spot
like an old can of beer.

24:48.133 --> 24:50.667
You know, all the best spots
are established already
on this river.

24:50.900 --> 24:52.100
It's got to be deep enough.

24:52.200 --> 24:53.933
There can't be
sandbars below it.

24:54.033 --> 24:55.300
There can't be snags.

24:55.367 --> 24:57.367
There's only so many
spots like that on the river

24:57.433 --> 24:59.600
without travelling
a long distance.

25:01.600 --> 25:02.833
I'm gonna give it a shot.

25:02.900 --> 25:04.467
I'm gonna
head back down to camp

25:04.533 --> 25:06.300
and hope for the best here.

25:18.400 --> 25:20.633
All right,
so I set my net in a new spot.

25:20.700 --> 25:22.000
Now I'm going up there.

25:22.233 --> 25:24.233
Got to pull my net
before fishing closes.

25:24.333 --> 25:26.333
So I'm really hoping there's
gonna be some fish in there.

25:26.400 --> 25:27.700
I really got high hopes.

25:27.767 --> 25:30.233
I'm hoping this spot
is gonna catch some fish.

25:30.933 --> 25:32.400
(MOTOR STUTTERS)

25:40.233 --> 25:42.733
Cutting some corners
on the river
like I normally do

25:42.800 --> 25:44.300
'cause this boat's
good for shallow water,

25:44.367 --> 25:47.667
trying to save some gas
and nailed a sandbar.

25:49.200 --> 25:50.433
(MOTOR STARTS)

25:50.500 --> 25:52.567
Luckily this is an old-school,
tough motor.

25:53.700 --> 25:55.400
Made for taking abuse.

26:01.667 --> 26:02.900
Go check this net.

26:03.000 --> 26:05.800
I moved my net yesterday
to a new spot.

26:05.867 --> 26:08.033
Didn't catch any fish
where I started at.

26:08.133 --> 26:12.067
So, I got high hopes that this
spot's gonna catch some fish.

26:12.300 --> 26:15.300
I'm getting at the end
of my 42-hour period
of fishing here,

26:15.367 --> 26:18.200
so, I got to pull this net
after I check it

26:18.267 --> 26:20.500
and I'm just hoping
there's some fish in here.

26:22.467 --> 26:24.167
It's not looking good
so far though.

26:26.333 --> 26:27.900
I don't feel
any weight in the net.

26:28.467 --> 26:31.067
It's a lot of effort
put into this.

26:31.767 --> 26:34.533
Lot of money spent
and a lot of time.

26:34.600 --> 26:36.000
Caught a lot of grass.

26:37.700 --> 26:40.467
Nothing. Damn it!
Nothing in here.

26:42.933 --> 26:45.833
Zero fish to show
for three days of work.

26:48.267 --> 26:49.267
Oh!

26:49.767 --> 26:51.067
What a bummer, man.

26:51.133 --> 26:52.333
(GROANS)

26:54.667 --> 26:55.833
It's kind of discouraging,

26:55.900 --> 26:57.667
but this is just kind of
how it goes.

26:57.867 --> 27:00.800
To me, using a net,
it's not optimal.

27:00.967 --> 27:03.100
But it's not cheap
to keep a bunch of dogs,

27:03.167 --> 27:05.067
you know, like,
I need these fish.

27:05.433 --> 27:08.267
I can't give up on this.
I got to keep at it.

27:09.400 --> 27:12.033
Just hope and pray
that I'm gonna catch
some fish here soon.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.800
AGNES: Well, we all
try to help each other,

27:17.867 --> 27:19.900
share with each other,
respect each other.

27:19.967 --> 27:21.733
Every one of us, a family.

27:27.133 --> 27:28.600
We just got to
keep moving faster.

27:28.700 --> 27:30.600
That wind is really
picking up already.

27:30.667 --> 27:32.000
NARRATOR: A severe
weather warning

27:32.067 --> 27:34.467
has been issued
for the Kiwalik River area.

27:35.033 --> 27:37.967
Agnes and her daughters
must work quickly
to secure camp

27:38.033 --> 27:40.700
before the strong winds
force them to hunker down.

27:41.800 --> 27:44.200
Careful, Idi,
it might just blow right off.

27:44.600 --> 27:46.833
I'll hold it,
I'll hold it while you untie.

27:47.033 --> 27:50.133
We're doing the best we can,
working as fast as we can.

27:50.200 --> 27:51.467
Lot of girl power here

27:51.533 --> 27:54.700
and, um, hopefully
it'll hold through the gusts.

27:55.533 --> 27:56.767
There we go.

27:57.600 --> 27:59.433
So that's what
we're fighting, is wind.

27:59.833 --> 28:03.667
Idi, if you go grab
the other side and you
pull that rope we put on.

28:03.733 --> 28:05.467
Go pull
your sister's other side.

28:05.567 --> 28:08.300
We need to use that tarp
as the weight for the tepee

28:08.367 --> 28:10.867
and cover it up
so the wind won't blow

28:10.933 --> 28:14.467
and it'll be a little bit more
heavier than that, um, canvas.

28:15.000 --> 28:16.833
We almost got it.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.967
Yee! We got it.

28:19.033 --> 28:21.867
This one.
We're doing good, girls.

28:22.633 --> 28:25.267
Nothing's blown away yet,
we're doing good.

28:25.933 --> 28:27.233
Getting worried
about those guys,

28:27.300 --> 28:29.900
they never come back yet.
Man, look how windy it get.

28:35.467 --> 28:37.067
CHIP: I see you got an eider.

28:37.167 --> 28:39.867
He's, uh...
He's gonna be, like,
having a freaking turkey.

28:40.233 --> 28:41.433
You make me hungry.

28:41.867 --> 28:44.167
NARRATOR: While the
Hailstone girls secure camp,

28:44.233 --> 28:46.267
Chip and his son, Jon,
have gone down the river

28:46.333 --> 28:49.600
to harvest vital wood
and food to weather the storm.

28:50.000 --> 28:51.967
CHIP: We ain't got enough wood
for a couple nights,

28:52.033 --> 28:55.567
so we ain't going nowhere
'til we got enough wood,
but there's more down here.

28:55.633 --> 28:58.100
The thing about
the wind is that we get
a wind-chill factor up here,

28:58.167 --> 29:00.300
and when it's cold,
it gets really cold

29:00.467 --> 29:02.000
and if we have to
be in a tent,

29:02.067 --> 29:03.633
or if we have to work
with wet things,

29:03.700 --> 29:05.500
or if we have to go out and
gather things from the tent,

29:05.567 --> 29:07.633
we want to return to
somewhere really, really warm.

29:08.633 --> 29:09.967
Now it looks like
we're beating the wind,

29:10.033 --> 29:11.300
but the wind's
creeping up on us.

29:11.433 --> 29:12.967
I can see real windy clouds

29:13.033 --> 29:14.900
and I feel an increase
in the speed myself,

29:14.967 --> 29:18.400
so I'm pretty glad I'm getting
this part of it all done.

29:18.467 --> 29:21.067
Once we're at camp, we can
just work relentlessly there,

29:21.133 --> 29:22.500
'cause we can always
take a rest when we want.

29:22.567 --> 29:25.533
But out here,
there's not much to rest on,

29:25.633 --> 29:27.300
so we'll get the heat done.

29:35.533 --> 29:37.033
Right in front of you!

29:41.567 --> 29:42.600
(GUNSHOT)

29:43.933 --> 29:45.733
-(GUNSHOT)
-CHIP: Ooh.

29:46.600 --> 29:47.600
(GROANS)

29:49.300 --> 29:50.733
That one was so close

29:50.800 --> 29:52.967
I was afraid
you were gonna hit it
and just blow it up.

29:55.433 --> 29:57.433
JON: Ah! There we go.

29:57.500 --> 30:00.133
CHIP: Looks like
we got our heat,
we got our meat.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.267
We need to get to camp.

30:01.600 --> 30:03.433
We're gonna go chop it all up

30:03.500 --> 30:05.033
and we'll use one
to cook the other.

30:10.867 --> 30:15.000
SUE: You can be
as prepared as you can
make yourself for any event,

30:15.233 --> 30:16.567
and life's gonna
throw you a curveball.

30:24.567 --> 30:27.600
One of my pilots, uh,
just informed me he was...

30:27.667 --> 30:29.667
He had
a bad smell in the room.

30:30.533 --> 30:31.767
I got to check that out.

30:32.300 --> 30:34.767
I can smell hot wire
even from out here.

30:37.767 --> 30:38.867
Ooh.

30:40.133 --> 30:42.033
I mean,
I ain't got no power here.

30:42.467 --> 30:44.367
(SNIFFS) Yeah,
you can really smell it.

30:51.300 --> 30:52.467
(SNIFFS)

30:52.700 --> 30:53.700
Huh.

30:55.267 --> 30:56.767
I do not need this.

30:57.667 --> 31:00.467
I've got plane comin' in,
bringing me all my stuff.

31:00.533 --> 31:02.633
All of my food,
all of my appliances,

31:03.100 --> 31:05.800
hot wires in a trailer
and I got to shut power down.

31:05.867 --> 31:07.000
Fucking unreal.

31:10.367 --> 31:11.433
-(ENGINE REVS)
-We have, uh,

31:11.500 --> 31:12.633
an electrical issue in camp.

31:12.700 --> 31:15.633
One of the trailers
is reeking of hot wire.

31:15.700 --> 31:18.367
Half the dining hall
won't come on,

31:18.433 --> 31:20.867
and we got a break
in the electrical wires.

31:22.700 --> 31:24.700
(MOTOR STOPPING)

31:24.767 --> 31:26.200
I hate electricity. I hate it.

31:26.267 --> 31:28.433
I can say it like
two more times, I hate it.

31:29.433 --> 31:33.333
NARRATOR: With power down,
Sue is unable to communicate
with the incoming plane.

31:34.200 --> 31:37.500
She must fix the problem,
or risk missing the delivery.

31:37.667 --> 31:39.833
SUE: So it's all of this row
is dead

31:40.300 --> 31:44.167
and this side,
anything that runs on that leg
is now inoperable.

31:44.533 --> 31:46.067
I've got a plane comin' in.

31:46.133 --> 31:48.433
Tens of thousands of dollars
wrapped up into it.

31:48.667 --> 31:50.800
I am going up,

31:51.100 --> 31:52.633
hopefully not down,

31:53.100 --> 31:55.300
getting on the roof
and following wiring.

31:56.733 --> 31:58.333
I've got to follow the wires.

31:58.400 --> 32:01.300
Some go this way and go into
the gen shed that way.

32:01.367 --> 32:03.000
Some branch off
and go in here.

32:03.067 --> 32:07.367
I've got to find out
which of our offending wires
are going where.

32:09.300 --> 32:12.467
I inherited a system
that was antiquated,

32:12.733 --> 32:14.467
and I'm working on updating it

32:14.533 --> 32:17.900
and I've been feeling very
proud of myself. I still do.

32:18.000 --> 32:21.200
I can still recognise,
"Follow the wire,
this is a problem."

32:21.267 --> 32:24.033
But then it starts getting to
where it's beyond my ability.

32:26.167 --> 32:29.167
All right,
so I'm gonna kick it on
and send the power out.

32:29.233 --> 32:30.233
(WHIRRING)

32:52.500 --> 32:54.433
No power. Fuck!

32:55.700 --> 32:57.300
There's a problem on this row.

32:57.367 --> 32:59.767
I call 'em row one,
row two and row three.

32:59.833 --> 33:01.267
Two and three and doing good,

33:01.333 --> 33:02.967
but this is still
a problem child.

33:03.567 --> 33:07.600
Following the line in,
you can determine
it's got to be here.

33:07.733 --> 33:09.567
Weatherworn, cracked, dried.

33:09.633 --> 33:12.667
That looks kind of
burned out to me. Unsafe.

33:13.167 --> 33:15.467
These are some of
the harshest conditions

33:16.100 --> 33:18.767
anywhere on the planet,
to try and run a business.

33:19.567 --> 33:22.567
Metal, plastic, parts,
things break.

33:23.033 --> 33:24.200
And they break frequently.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.600
Power travels down
what you call legs.

33:34.800 --> 33:39.500
And one of the legs,
this being part of that leg,
seems to be the culprit.

33:39.967 --> 33:42.933
I have no idea why
this is going balls up now,

33:43.000 --> 33:45.200
no idea at all. It just is.

33:45.500 --> 33:49.067
You know, we've come
to the end of my knowledge
of electrical.

33:49.133 --> 33:51.267
I don't want to be the one
that burns camp down.

33:51.533 --> 33:55.800
In the back of my mind,
I'm risking the rest of camp
if there's an unstable issue.

33:55.867 --> 33:58.800
But if I don't risk it,
I won't have
power for anything.

33:58.900 --> 34:00.533
The plane's coming in.

34:00.600 --> 34:02.400
It's gonna be here.
I don't have a choice.

34:05.933 --> 34:08.467
What I did
is I removed this entire line.

34:08.533 --> 34:10.233
That's dead.
That row is dead to me now.

34:10.300 --> 34:11.967
Three trailers, gone.

34:12.233 --> 34:15.967
Now that plane can land and
I'm just gonna lose revenue
on that row of trailers.

34:17.300 --> 34:21.233
I mean, sometimes
you gotta give a little
to take what you can.

34:26.367 --> 34:29.333
CHIP: As long as we hustle,
we work hard
and we get prepared,

34:29.800 --> 34:31.400
preparedness will
always win out.

34:38.667 --> 34:40.567
-(GIGGLES)
-Uh, where's all the wood?

34:40.633 --> 34:42.567
CHIP: Ah-ha,
where's your glasses?

34:42.767 --> 34:44.833
I don't see caribou,
but you guys got some birds.

34:45.000 --> 34:46.300
Got a duck right here,
a big eider

34:46.367 --> 34:48.100
-and back there a black duck.
-IDI: Oh, right on.

34:48.200 --> 34:49.400
(IDI SPEAKING)

34:49.500 --> 34:50.767
Yeah, please do.

34:51.300 --> 34:53.733
This'll have to be skinned.
The other one
will have to be, uh, plucked.

34:54.133 --> 34:56.567
Boy, ladies,
they look like they're busy.

34:56.633 --> 35:00.100
We got everything on the,
of our little list
of need-to-be-done, done.

35:00.400 --> 35:02.400
I got more firewood
than we're gonna need.

35:02.467 --> 35:03.933
We would have liked to have
gotten a few more ducks,

35:04.000 --> 35:05.267
but that didn't turn out.

35:05.333 --> 35:06.833
But that's enough to
get us through a couple days

35:06.900 --> 35:08.933
with potatoes and rice
and whatever else we got.

35:09.000 --> 35:11.367
Right on! Looks like dinner
and some wood heat.

35:11.867 --> 35:13.300
JON: Yep. Got an eider.

35:13.367 --> 35:14.733
Eider?

35:14.933 --> 35:16.300
JON: That's some dinner.

35:16.367 --> 35:19.500
That's a big bird. Just right
for a big, family-size meal.

35:19.600 --> 35:22.267
Mary will go help you
with those, son.

35:22.367 --> 35:23.667
Or the little one at least.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.600
I'm bringing more wood in.

35:25.667 --> 35:28.033
CHIP: We finished up
what we needed to do
and I think we did it on time.

35:28.200 --> 35:31.100
And tonight, we enjoy the heat
and the meat and the tent.

35:31.633 --> 35:33.400
Mary'll start the head,
the wings, and the feet,

35:33.467 --> 35:34.667
and then you can pluck it.

35:34.900 --> 35:36.100
The heart's good.

35:36.167 --> 35:38.333
It's real important for us
to all work together.

35:40.367 --> 35:42.700
We all start off our day,
we make our plans

35:42.767 --> 35:45.133
and we all work together
to get everything done.

35:45.200 --> 35:48.533
Everything's a lot easier
when you can depend on people.

35:49.233 --> 35:50.767
It's real cold
in the wind chill,

35:50.833 --> 35:53.100
so, we'll be staying here,
staying warm.

35:53.300 --> 35:57.100
Staying dry,
staying out of the wind
and staying well fed.

35:59.233 --> 36:00.767
CHIP: I would say
dinner's done.

36:00.867 --> 36:04.967
You got some
eider duck here,
got some rice made.

36:05.033 --> 36:06.067
It's nice to be in here.

36:06.133 --> 36:07.667
-Nice and warm.
-And out of the wind.

36:07.733 --> 36:08.967
CHIP: Out of the wind, yep.

36:09.200 --> 36:11.800
I would say we've done
very well, working together.

36:11.867 --> 36:13.700
AGNES: Good duck.
Thanks, son.
JON: Mmm-hmm.

36:13.767 --> 36:14.933
-Thank you, honey.
-CHIP: Yeah.

36:15.000 --> 36:16.700
I'm glad to be warm.

36:16.767 --> 36:19.400
And thank you
for fixing this place up and
keeping us out of the wind.

36:19.567 --> 36:21.333
Jon got meat, I got heat

36:21.533 --> 36:23.033
and you girls
have got the weather beat.

36:29.467 --> 36:31.233
JESSIE: I have
an athletic bond with the fish

36:31.300 --> 36:32.567
because, you know,
I'm the same way.

36:32.700 --> 36:34.667
I'm always roaming,
always moving.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.867
I'm back down here at camp,
picking up my net.

36:40.967 --> 36:44.500
I'm gonna go back
and try to put it in
a different spot upriver.

36:44.833 --> 36:46.900
Fishing's back open now.

36:47.067 --> 36:49.167
Get this net out now
and hope for the best.

36:50.967 --> 36:52.667
This will be the third time
I've moved it.

36:52.767 --> 36:54.733
I tried a few spots
closer to town here,

36:54.800 --> 36:56.333
trying to save some gas.

36:56.400 --> 36:58.400
It didn't work out for me
or pan out for me.

37:00.200 --> 37:01.733
I come upriver further,

37:01.800 --> 37:03.133
cut off
some bends of the river,

37:03.200 --> 37:04.867
search some slews
so I could get up here.

37:04.933 --> 37:06.200
It's gonna cost me
a little more gas,

37:06.267 --> 37:09.633
but I know there's not
the competition upriver.

37:11.700 --> 37:14.000
Fishing is
just like this sometimes.

37:14.067 --> 37:15.333
Nothing comes easy.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.400
It just comes with diligence
and hard work out here.

37:18.067 --> 37:20.767
I don't think
I've ever gotten anything
too easy on this river.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.733
Think that might be
a good spot right there.

37:34.133 --> 37:35.667
Yeah, looks good.

37:36.167 --> 37:37.933
The river's narrow here.

37:39.067 --> 37:40.967
Well, this has
a really good rock bottom

37:41.033 --> 37:43.667
and it's got
a lot of depth here, so...

37:44.367 --> 37:48.133
And it's got a swirling eddy
where there's
a back current comin' up.

37:48.733 --> 37:52.967
Fish have just travelled
a big, long bend of the river
without any eddies in it,

37:53.033 --> 37:55.500
and so I'm hoping that
they're gonna stop here
and rest here

37:55.567 --> 37:58.733
as they're
coming out of the eddy,
that they'll go into my net.

37:58.800 --> 38:00.367
I think this'll be
a good spot.

38:02.367 --> 38:03.633
I decided to come up here,

38:03.700 --> 38:07.367
because I might
spend more money
driving my boat up here,

38:07.433 --> 38:09.967
but I think this will be
a more productive spot.

38:11.467 --> 38:13.533
"Third time's a charm"
would be nice here.

38:14.167 --> 38:15.233
That should do it.

38:18.833 --> 38:19.967
Fuck!

38:22.200 --> 38:24.267
-(MOTOR STOPS)
-Fuck!

38:24.633 --> 38:27.000
Fuck me, man. God damn it!

38:33.800 --> 38:36.367
Friggin' just tangled
in my net.

38:37.233 --> 38:40.267
Try to get out of this thing
before I get pulled
downriver here.

38:41.833 --> 38:43.067
Shit.

38:48.433 --> 38:49.667
Fuck.

39:09.333 --> 39:11.200
I had some difficulties there.

39:11.267 --> 39:12.900
My prop got
hung up in the net.

39:12.967 --> 39:15.400
The current
was pulling me the wrong way.

39:16.100 --> 39:17.700
It's a stressful situation.

39:18.167 --> 39:20.467
Now all I can do is
just leave it to do its magic,

39:20.533 --> 39:22.833
and hopefully
it's gonna catch fish.

39:27.233 --> 39:29.333
SUE: I'd like to keep busy
and I like challenges.

39:29.533 --> 39:30.967
Not a day goes by
I don't get one,

39:31.067 --> 39:32.933
just sometimes
not the ones I expect.

39:39.100 --> 39:42.533
Zero wind,
unlimited vis, bluebird.

39:42.800 --> 39:44.833
All right,
I'll see you down there, bro.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.533
There is just that excitement
and that buzz

39:47.600 --> 39:50.200
any time I see
a plane come in.

39:50.267 --> 39:53.367
I feel charged up, 'cause
that's why this is here.

39:53.433 --> 39:54.900
That's why Kavik exists.

39:54.967 --> 39:56.633
It wants to be
the happy little place

39:56.700 --> 39:58.900
that people can utilise
for whatever they need.

40:00.300 --> 40:01.300
Hey, guys.

40:01.533 --> 40:02.800
(PILOT SPEAKING)

40:02.967 --> 40:05.300
I know, I had, uh...

40:05.367 --> 40:06.800
Seems like every five years
I break myself.

40:06.867 --> 40:08.400
I broke myself good this time.

40:08.467 --> 40:11.133
You develop a relationship
with these people.

40:11.200 --> 40:14.133
Very close,
tight-knit relationship.
They care about me.

40:14.200 --> 40:17.300
They were worried when
they heard about my injuries.

40:17.400 --> 40:20.833
Seeing me face-to-face lets
them know I'm still alive.

40:23.067 --> 40:25.033
You know, today
just kind of wraps up

40:25.667 --> 40:28.233
the epitome of
the whole experience out here.

40:28.767 --> 40:30.633
You have challenges
that you have to meet.

40:30.767 --> 40:32.033
The runway has to be done.

40:32.367 --> 40:33.533
This has to be done.

40:33.600 --> 40:35.700
I'm having
electrical issues in camp.

40:35.767 --> 40:38.633
The old food out, bam,
the new food came in.

40:38.767 --> 40:41.400
Bam, I can now charge
the full rate for people.

40:41.567 --> 40:44.433
Everything's in place,
Kavik is open for business.

40:47.467 --> 40:49.200
-PILOT: Ciao.
-Thank you very much.

40:49.267 --> 40:50.967
As always,
you guys save my bacon

40:51.033 --> 40:53.333
-and bring it
at the same time.
-See y'all later.

40:54.500 --> 40:56.333
I got a bunch of
good food in here.

40:56.400 --> 40:58.833
Bunch of new appliances.
It's a good day to be me.

41:04.900 --> 41:06.900
JESSIE: You got to
be prepared year-to-year,

41:07.000 --> 41:10.133
week-to-week, to adapt
to the changes of the river.

41:13.667 --> 41:15.733
Heading upriver
to go check my net here

41:15.800 --> 41:18.700
and see how it's been doing.
Left it in for a good bit.

41:19.267 --> 41:21.567
I hope it's full of fish
and not driftwood,

41:21.667 --> 41:24.733
'cause I'd be very
disappointed to have
done all this work,

41:24.867 --> 41:28.300
all these days here,
and come up
empty-handed for it.

41:30.333 --> 41:32.133
(MOTOR STOPS)

41:38.833 --> 41:40.200
Oh, I'm hoping
there's some fish in here.

41:40.267 --> 41:42.333
There's a fish. Oh, yeah!

41:42.433 --> 41:43.500
All right.

41:43.567 --> 41:45.567
There's a nice summer chum
right there.

41:46.333 --> 41:48.133
That's a
good-looking fish, too.

41:49.033 --> 41:50.533
It's a female.

41:51.567 --> 41:53.367
It's gonna have
some nice roe in there to eat.

41:53.433 --> 41:55.500
I hope there's some more
in here for the dogs.

41:56.933 --> 41:58.667
I thought this was
a better spot.

41:59.767 --> 42:01.433
It is.
There's a bunch of fish!

42:01.500 --> 42:03.067
Yeah, that's what
I thought it would do.

42:03.133 --> 42:05.100
There's a whitefish!
All right, a king?

42:05.167 --> 42:07.500
You know,
I've set this net three times,

42:07.567 --> 42:09.467
I burned up a bunch
of gasoline and this is...

42:09.567 --> 42:11.167
This feels great.

42:11.267 --> 42:13.933
And I knew
this is how it was gonna be,
I just had to keep after it.

42:14.100 --> 42:15.167
There's another one.

42:15.967 --> 42:19.033
Good deal.
This net's catching them over
close to shore, too.

42:19.633 --> 42:21.700
That makes me feel like
there's gonna be more fish

42:21.767 --> 42:23.867
at the end of the net
than there is here.

42:23.933 --> 42:25.967
It doesn't get old to me

42:26.033 --> 42:28.500
to pull up to a net
or a fish wheel and see fish.

42:28.567 --> 42:29.933
It's always
an exciting feeling.

42:30.367 --> 42:33.733
And I just started
being overwhelmed with
thoughts of cutting this fish

42:33.800 --> 42:35.767
and putting it
into a good eating food.

42:36.400 --> 42:37.733
Got my net.

42:37.800 --> 42:40.500
It's back where
it needs to be,
out in the water,

42:40.567 --> 42:42.867
and take these home
and cook up for the dogs

42:42.933 --> 42:45.900
and eat some really good,
fresh fish

42:47.033 --> 42:48.200
and be thankful.

42:49.033 --> 42:52.067
Now I got my fish all put up

42:52.833 --> 42:56.267
and time to head
down back to camp
and get to work.

42:56.867 --> 42:59.300
This is a great start
to my fishing season.

43:01.967 --> 43:03.500
But you can't get
better than this.

43:03.567 --> 43:05.067
The feeling of
living on this river,

43:05.133 --> 43:08.167
and it's good start
to the fishing season for me.

43:09.567 --> 43:12.133
Summer's just
all about hard work.

43:12.200 --> 43:13.733
I think of it as play.
