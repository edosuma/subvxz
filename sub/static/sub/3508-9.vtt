<Font color=#FFFFO0>Love Me Dead</font>

00:00.258 --> 00:01.237
There are two kinds of folks

00:01.264 --> 00:02.864
who sit around thinking
about how to kill people:

00:03.198 --> 00:04.924
psychopaths and mystery writers.

00:05.262 --> 00:06.284
I'm the kind that pays better.

00:06.585 --> 00:07.285
Who am I?

00:07.374 --> 00:08.513
I'm Rick Castle.

00:08.514 --> 00:09.608
Castle.

00:08.948 --> 00:09.608
Castle.

00:09.609 --> 00:11.609
I really am ruggedly handsome,
aren't I?

00:11.855 --> 00:14.045
Every writer needs inspiration.
And I found mine.

00:14.155 --> 00:14.974
Detective Kate Beckett.

00:15.009 --> 00:16.029
- Beckett.
- Beckett.

00:16.064 --> 00:17.970
- Nikki Heat?
- The character he's basing on you.

00:18.116 --> 00:19.702
And thanks to my friendship
with the mayor,

00:19.703 --> 00:20.703
I get to be on her case.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.880
I would be happy
to let you spank me.

00:22.915 --> 00:23.991
And together, we catch killers

00:24.739 --> 00:25.827
We make a pretty
good team, you know?

00:25.928 --> 00:26.928
Like Starsky and Hutch.

00:27.062 --> 00:27.956
Turner and Hooch.

00:28.057 --> 00:29.757
You do remind me
a little of Hooch.

00:31.253 --> 00:33.055
♪ oh-a-oh-oh ♪¶

00:33.256 --> 00:35.157
♪ oh-a-oh-oh ♪

00:35.558 --> 00:37.760
I have to laugh at her jokes.
She's my boss.

00:37.761 --> 00:39.263
Do you have to stare
at her boobs, too?

00:39.464 --> 00:40.764
I wasn't. She had a stain.

00:40.864 --> 00:42.832
And you were trying
to memorize the shape?

00:43.033 --> 00:45.001
What? No. I swear.

00:46.402 --> 00:48.737
If I'm lying,
my God strike me down...

00:49.040 --> 00:50.040
Oh! Aah!

00:50.640 --> 00:51.407
Oh!

00:55.411 --> 00:56.445
Aah!

01:01.050 --> 01:03.152
Yeah, I want to.
I just... I don't know.

01:04.352 --> 01:05.355
Yes, I...

01:07.857 --> 01:09.659
I can't tell him. He'll freak.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.029
He will.

01:15.198 --> 01:16.532
- Who'll freak?
- What?

01:16.933 --> 01:17.936
Who's gonna freak?

01:17.937 --> 01:20.737
Oh, um, someone from school.
You don't know them.

01:21.737 --> 01:22.705
Are you sure?

01:22.806 --> 01:23.906
Mm-hmm.

01:25.407 --> 01:26.409
But I thought I knew all your friends.

01:26.610 --> 01:28.945
Hey, I'm sorry, Dad,
but I have a ton of schoolwork.

01:28.946 --> 01:29.680
Oh, no. Yeah.

01:34.651 --> 01:36.251
Hey, uh...

01:36.952 --> 01:38.187
You know you could
tell me anything, right?

01:38.288 --> 01:38.922
Yep.

01:44.060 --> 01:44.994
Castle.

01:47.397 --> 01:48.731
A body falls out of the sky,

01:48.832 --> 01:50.634
and somehow that's my fault?

01:50.835 --> 01:51.735
Ugh!

01:52.235 --> 01:53.169
Hey, Castle.

01:54.070 --> 01:56.138
I hope we didn't take you away
from something important

01:56.539 --> 01:57.507
or someone.

01:58.308 --> 01:59.875
Did you ever keep secrets
from your Dad?

02:00.776 --> 02:01.376
Sure.

02:01.677 --> 02:02.878
What kind?

02:03.479 --> 02:04.480
Do you really want to know?

02:04.781 --> 02:06.182
About your secrets?
Absolutely?

02:06.483 --> 02:08.717
About my daughter's? Mm.

02:09.018 --> 02:10.919
You know what?
I'm sure it's nothing.

02:10.919 --> 02:12.522
Alexis would never keep
anything serious from me.

02:12.523 --> 02:14.424
- I'm the cool Dad.
- Uh-huh.

02:16.593 --> 02:18.962
- Sir, what are you doing here?
- The victim's Jack Buckley.

02:19.763 --> 02:20.632
Who's Jack Buckley?

02:20.933 --> 02:22.933
An assistant District Attorney.
One of the good guys.

02:23.433 --> 02:24.633
Buckley hated making deals,

02:24.634 --> 02:25.935
Loved putting bad guys behind bars.

02:26.736 --> 02:30.272
He's the lawyer every cop
wanted prosecuting their case.

02:31.073 --> 02:33.175
Well, looks like he didn't
go down without a fight.

02:33.476 --> 02:35.111
Yeah, his jacket was torn.

02:35.912 --> 02:37.613
We found his briefcase
up on the roof

02:37.814 --> 02:39.348
Along with his left shoe.

02:39.749 --> 02:41.051
CSU is doing a full sweep.

02:41.252 --> 02:44.453
Well, Jack's a big boy.
Whoever did it must be strong.

02:44.754 --> 02:45.822
Wait. I know what this is.

02:46.323 --> 02:48.491
Lawyer puts criminal in jail.
Criminal feels wronged.

02:48.492 --> 02:50.026
Criminal kills lawyer.
This is "Cape Fear."

02:52.227 --> 02:53.831
Any idea what he was doing up there?

02:53.932 --> 02:55.732
No, I talked to his secretary,

02:55.832 --> 02:57.499
she said Buckley
left work around 8:00,

02:57.800 --> 02:59.869
heading straight home,
which is on the West Side.

02:59.870 --> 03:01.170
And get this.

03:01.270 --> 03:03.406
Buckley was a subway rider.
He didn't own a car.

03:03.507 --> 03:04.307
Then what's he doing

03:04.407 --> 03:05.576
at a parking garage
on the East Side?

03:06.477 --> 03:07.277
That's a good question.

03:07.977 --> 03:09.278
Was Buckley married?

03:09.379 --> 03:11.647
Divorced. Ex-wife lives in California.

03:12.148 --> 03:14.249
Reach out to his wife.
Let's start looking

03:14.250 --> 03:16.118
into his personal life
and see what we can find.

03:16.319 --> 03:17.720
The Mayor wants this solved quickly.

03:17.921 --> 03:20.590
Nobody kills a law enforcement
officer and gets away with it.

03:24.527 --> 03:26.162
I just can't believe that he's dead.

03:26.563 --> 03:29.598
And you have no idea
why he was in the garage?

03:29.599 --> 03:30.701
No.

03:30.702 --> 03:33.402
Uh, here are the printouts of
Mr. Buckley's cases you wanted.

03:33.502 --> 03:34.403
Thanks.

03:34.404 --> 03:35.805
I'm telling, you this "Cape Fear" list

03:35.806 --> 03:37.707
is gonna be a gold mine of suspects.

03:37.708 --> 03:39.709
Check out this guy... Archibald Spinks.

03:40.010 --> 03:41.711
Five counts of attempted murder,

03:41.812 --> 03:43.780
One count of indecent exposure.

03:44.381 --> 03:46.249
You don't suppose he tried
to kill 'em with his...

03:46.550 --> 03:47.617
Yeah, that wouldn't work.

03:48.518 --> 03:49.919
Had Mr. Buckley ever received
any threats,

03:49.920 --> 03:51.922
any prosecutions that went ugly?

03:51.923 --> 03:53.623
Well, he didn't think
he was doing his job right

03:53.723 --> 03:56.559
if he wasn't being threatened,
but nothing recently, no.

03:56.760 --> 03:58.862
He did seem to be upset
the past few days.

03:59.163 --> 04:00.863
- Any idea why?
- No.

04:00.963 --> 04:03.098
You know, there was that man
the police brought in.

04:03.099 --> 04:03.668
What man?

04:03.669 --> 04:06.469
It was right after lunch
on Monday. A cop brought in

04:06.569 --> 04:08.405
a tough-looking guy in
handcuffs, took him right in

04:08.406 --> 04:10.308
to Mr. Buckley's office
and then waited outside.

04:10.309 --> 04:11.709
Yeah, we heard them yelling
through the door,

04:11.809 --> 04:13.244
and then the officer took him away.

04:13.245 --> 04:14.445
That kinda thing happen a lot?

04:14.646 --> 04:15.546
Never

04:15.745 --> 04:17.346
Do you remember the officer's name?

04:17.348 --> 04:20.284
Yeah. Frank. Uh, Frank...
Frank Curtis.

04:22.885 --> 04:23.552
Curtis doesn't remember

04:23.553 --> 04:25.154
why Buckley asked him
to bring the guy in,

04:25.155 --> 04:28.090
but he does remember his name.
John Knox.

04:28.191 --> 04:30.059
Dozens of priors.
Uniforms are bringing him in.

04:30.860 --> 04:32.595
I'm guessing this guy
isn't exactly an altar boy.

04:32.596 --> 04:34.797
You think?
Come on. Let's go.

04:36.298 --> 04:37.799
<i>You've got quite a record,
Mr. Knox.</i>

04:38.000 --> 04:39.168
<i>Your parents must be proud.</i>

04:39.169 --> 04:41.537
<i>Yeah, they hang all my
mug shots on the fridge.</i>

04:41.538 --> 04:43.173
Can we cut to the chase?

04:45.174 --> 04:46.374
Two days ago, you had an argument

04:46.474 --> 04:47.676
with Buckley in his office.

04:47.777 --> 04:48.745
Last night we found him dead.

04:48.846 --> 04:50.715
So you can understand our interest.

04:50.916 --> 04:53.516
Sure, but you're wasting your time.
I didn't kill the guy.

04:53.916 --> 04:54.783
Really?

04:54.784 --> 04:56.919
Because it says here
that you have quite a history

04:56.920 --> 04:59.922
of trying to kill people...
three in the last two years,

04:59.923 --> 05:03.292
- Or am I missing any?
- I was never convicted of anything.

05:03.493 --> 05:04.960
That's not exactly a denial.

05:05.661 --> 05:07.062
Do you work out?

05:07.163 --> 05:09.298
You know, bench press, dead lift?

05:10.199 --> 05:11.700
It must take
a lot of upper body strength

05:11.701 --> 05:12.702
to throw a guy off a roof.

05:12.703 --> 05:14.903
Who is this guy?

05:15.104 --> 05:16.506
What did you and Buckley fight about?

05:16.807 --> 05:19.442
Look, he had it out for me
because he put me on trial

05:19.443 --> 05:22.311
for an assault I didn't commit
and he lost.

05:22.512 --> 05:24.014
And rather than being a man about it,

05:24.015 --> 05:25.882
he decided to rattle my cage,

05:25.883 --> 05:28.184
to show me who was the alpha male.

05:28.385 --> 05:30.920
So, yeah, it was annoying
and childish,

05:30.921 --> 05:34.656
but not something you kill
a guy over, especially a DA.

05:34.657 --> 05:38.293
Now I may be a criminal,
but I'm not... stupid.

05:38.794 --> 05:41.163
Do you have an alibi
for Buckley's murder?

05:41.764 --> 05:43.232
I don't know.
What time was he killed?

05:43.433 --> 05:46.035
- 9:30 pm
- I was at an AA Meeting.

05:46.836 --> 05:49.137
Anonymous? That's cute.

05:49.238 --> 05:51.207
- You don't believe me?
- Mnh-mnh.

05:51.608 --> 05:53.476
Well, then maybe
you'll believe my sponsor...

05:54.577 --> 05:56.413
Reverend Daniel Miller.

05:58.014 --> 05:59.548
Did you say "Reverend"?

06:02.218 --> 06:03.786
So where are we with Knox?

06:04.087 --> 06:05.387
The alibi looks solid.

06:05.588 --> 06:06.722
Castle and Beckett are interviewing

06:06.723 --> 06:07.958
the good Reverend right now.

06:08.159 --> 06:09.059
What about forensics?

06:09.159 --> 06:11.994
Looks like a bust, but I did
find something interesting

06:11.995 --> 06:14.064
when checked into Buckley's
Metro card history.

06:14.265 --> 06:16.866
His card only made two swipes
a day for the whole month...

06:16.867 --> 06:19.335
6:00 am at the subway by his apartment,

06:19.336 --> 06:20.305
8:00 pm by his office.

06:20.406 --> 06:22.506
Buckley lived for the job,
especially after the divorce.

06:23.006 --> 06:24.608
Probably trying to
lose himself in the work.

06:24.609 --> 06:26.609
On the day he was killed,
Buckley did something unusual.

06:26.709 --> 06:29.610
He made an extra trip
up to West 77th Street

06:29.611 --> 06:30.312
before he went to work.

06:30.313 --> 06:32.482
- His secretary has no idea why.
- See if you can find out.

06:32.583 --> 06:35.617
Yo, cap. Looks like somebody
was following our boy Buckley.

06:35.818 --> 06:37.620
The doorman in his apartment
said that a guy

06:37.621 --> 06:40.256
came in there two days ago
demanding to talk to Buckley,

06:40.257 --> 06:41.358
wouldn't take no for an answer.

06:41.459 --> 06:43.461
Doorman practically had to
throw the guy out.

06:43.662 --> 06:46.697
Then on the morning of Buckley's
murder, the doorman swears

06:46.698 --> 06:49.500
that he saw the same guy hanging
around outside the building.

06:50.001 --> 06:52.071
I snagged a photo
off the video surveillance.

06:53.872 --> 06:55.472
Start looking through
some mug shot books.

06:58.474 --> 06:59.474
Thank you, Reverend.

06:59.875 --> 07:00.976
- Pleasure meeting you.
- Thanks.

07:02.677 --> 07:03.645
Is this for our case?

07:04.246 --> 07:06.782
Yeah, the guy who tried to
hassle Buckley at his building.

07:06.783 --> 07:09.284
Wait a second. I know this guy.

07:09.585 --> 07:11.287
Yes. My "Cape Fear" file.

07:11.288 --> 07:12.289
Ow!

07:12.990 --> 07:16.258
Right here. Right... Here.

07:16.759 --> 07:19.093
His name is Norman Jessup.

07:20.094 --> 07:21.396
Buckley got him four years ago

07:21.397 --> 07:23.065
on a bank robbery
where a guard got shot.

07:24.066 --> 07:26.101
See? I told you this file
would solve this case.

07:26.502 --> 07:28.270
It says here he got out
two weeks ago

07:28.271 --> 07:29.805
when his conviction was overturned

07:29.806 --> 07:31.441
by the Appellate Court on a technicality.

07:31.942 --> 07:34.077
That sounds like a reason
for Jessup to celebrate

07:34.078 --> 07:35.012
not to kill Buckley.

07:35.213 --> 07:37.513
Yeah, except Buckley already filed

07:37.613 --> 07:38.814
an intent to retry.

07:39.015 --> 07:41.483
Jessup was looking
at another two years in jail

07:41.484 --> 07:42.153
if Buckley won.

07:42.454 --> 07:44.554
Well, that might have
made Jessup a little mad.

07:44.654 --> 07:45.588
Right, and then it's all...

07:45.589 --> 07:48.058
"come out,
come out wherever you are."

07:48.459 --> 07:50.493
Really?
That's your de Niro?

07:50.594 --> 07:53.195
Get a current address
and a list of known associates.

07:53.196 --> 07:54.998
I'd like to hear
what Jessup has to say.

07:56.399 --> 07:58.266
Wait. Wait.
You got it all wrong.

07:59.403 --> 08:00.203
Hey!

08:00.303 --> 08:01.672
Come on! Police! Break it up!

08:03.473 --> 08:04.341
Are you gonna do something?

08:05.142 --> 08:07.142
Breaking up a bar fight
is a sure way to get hit.

08:07.342 --> 08:08.877
Don't worry.
It'll be over in a minute.

08:09.278 --> 08:10.779
You know, I was
in a bar fight once.

08:10.880 --> 08:11.914
Really? Who won?

08:11.915 --> 08:13.318
Ow! Ah!

08:13.319 --> 08:14.319
Oh, let me guess.

08:15.819 --> 08:16.620
Not you.

08:18.921 --> 08:20.391
You want to fight, Mr. Jessup?

08:20.392 --> 08:22.092
You can fight a murder charge.

Yo, I'm sorry, man.

08:31.222 --> 08:32.190
I didn't mean to embarrass you

08:32.191 --> 08:33.193
In front of your girlfriend there.

08:33.494 --> 08:36.193
I am not his girlfriend.
I am a Homicide Detective.

08:36.794 --> 08:39.195
and you should be taking this
a little bit more seriously.

08:39.196 --> 08:41.498
Hey, that guy in that bar, he
started this whole thing, okay?

08:41.499 --> 08:42.799
He thought I was
hitting on his girlfriend,

08:42.801 --> 08:44.602
and I was not
hitting on his girlfriend.

08:44.603 --> 08:45.904
It was just a big misunderstanding.

08:45.905 --> 08:47.905
Right. Just like the bank robbery.

08:48.005 --> 08:50.174
Exactly.
I had no idea my buddies

08:50.175 --> 08:52.142
were gonna rob that bank...
no idea at all.

08:52.343 --> 08:54.279
They said their car broke down
and they needed a ride.

08:54.280 --> 08:56.081
<i>And I gave them a ride.</i>

08:56.382 --> 08:58.382
And that argument didn't sway Buckley?

08:58.482 --> 09:01.419
Can you believe it? He told my
lawyer that the guard got shot,

09:01.420 --> 09:02.821
and therefore, in the eyes of the law,

09:02.822 --> 09:05.357
I was just as responsible
as the guy who shot him.

09:05.358 --> 09:06.658
That must have made you angry.

09:07.158 --> 09:08.526
How'd you feel about the fact
that Buckley

09:08.527 --> 09:10.495
was gonna retry your case
and try to make you serve

09:10.596 --> 09:11.697
the final two years of your sentence?

09:11.698 --> 09:14.298
Honestly, lady?
I cried like a baby.

09:14.398 --> 09:14.901
Huh.

09:14.902 --> 09:17.902
Prison is not fun, okay?
I did not want to go back.

09:18.302 --> 09:19.471
I figured if I could
just talk to Mr. Buckley,

09:19.472 --> 09:20.840
I could let him know
where I'm coming from.

09:20.841 --> 09:23.841
Which is what you were doing
at Buckley's building.

09:23.941 --> 09:27.310
Whoa. Whoa. I followed the man
around for a few days, okay?

09:27.311 --> 09:29.281
Just so I could get
my courage up to talk to him.

09:29.282 --> 09:30.882
You were stalking Buckley?

09:31.782 --> 09:33.517
Stalking is a pretty damn ugly word.

09:33.618 --> 09:34.785
Let's not use stalking, okay?

09:34.786 --> 09:35.920
I was just trying
to feel the guy out.

09:35.921 --> 09:37.856
You know what I mean? Trying to
convince him, you know?

09:37.857 --> 09:38.724
In case you guys haven't noticed,

09:38.725 --> 09:40.861
I'm somewhat of a wordsmith,
you know?

09:40.862 --> 09:44.230
A real master of,
you know, of, uh...

09:44.431 --> 09:45.431
Words?

09:46.431 --> 09:48.631
Where were you between 9:00
and 10:00 last night?

09:48.632 --> 09:50.934
I was sitting in the bar
you guys just dragged me out of.

09:50.935 --> 09:53.236
Okay. Well, we're gonna
check into your alibi.

09:53.237 --> 09:55.071
In the meantime, you're going
back into holding

09:55.072 --> 09:56.541
until we can process you for assault.

09:56.742 --> 09:59.278
Oh, oh, come on!
I said I was sorry.

09:59.279 --> 10:00.979
Wait. Buckley's mystery trip.

10:01.179 --> 10:04.114
Were you following Buckley
uptown yesterday morning?

10:04.115 --> 10:05.049
Yeah, yeah, I was.

10:06.250 --> 10:07.751
- Where did he go?
- He met some asian dude

10:07.752 --> 10:10.054
outside this real fancy
apartment building.

10:10.255 --> 10:11.889
Then they started to argue
with each other.

10:13.690 --> 10:15.325
<i>You think maybe that's
the guy who killed him?</i>

10:15.526 --> 10:17.828
Would you recognize the building
if you saw it again?

10:17.929 --> 10:19.497
Oh, yeah. I get around.

10:21.298 --> 10:22.399
Road trip.

10:22.400 --> 10:26.169
♪♪

10:26.770 --> 10:28.572
Hey, you guys mind
if I take these things off?

10:29.173 --> 10:30.441
I'm starting to feel like a stereotype

10:30.442 --> 10:32.011
riding around in the back
of a police car wearing 'em.

10:32.312 --> 10:33.512
Sure. Do you want my key?

10:34.612 --> 10:37.181
No. I got it. Thanks.

10:41.885 --> 10:42.819
How did you do that?

10:42.820 --> 10:44.788
I've always
been good with locks.

10:45.089 --> 10:47.257
When I was in the joint,
I was thinking,

10:47.258 --> 10:50.160
how can I take this and make it
more productive, you know?

10:50.261 --> 10:51.929
So I been applying
to locksmith schools.

10:52.430 --> 10:54.998
But, you know, they won't let me
in on account that I'm a felon.

10:55.099 --> 10:56.034
Can you believe that?

10:56.335 --> 10:57.935
A felon who wants to be a locksmith.

10:58.035 --> 10:59.271
What could possibly go wrong there?

10:59.672 --> 11:00.972
You don't have to be mean about it.

11:01.072 --> 11:02.440
Yeah, wow.

11:03.541 --> 11:05.008
♪♪

11:08.779 --> 11:10.414
If you're gonna be a locksmith,
you gotta listen.

11:10.415 --> 11:12.651
Left to right,
right over left.

11:12.652 --> 11:13.952
I think I made it tighter.

11:14.152 --> 11:14.919
Jessup,

11:15.320 --> 11:16.120
do you see the building?

11:16.220 --> 11:17.155
Uh, that's a negative.

11:18.655 --> 11:19.455
Now bring it around...

11:19.456 --> 11:20.524
Beckett.

11:21.425 --> 11:24.295
Oh, hey. Alexis. Uh, are you
looking for your Dad?

11:26.296 --> 11:27.197
To me?

11:27.498 --> 11:28.332
Okay, what's up?

11:29.033 --> 11:31.634
Yeah, yeah. We can meet
at Sutton's around 7:30.

11:31.635 --> 11:32.536
Is that okay?

11:33.237 --> 11:34.105
All right,
I'll see you then.

11:35.306 --> 11:36.740
Was that Alexis calling you? Why?

11:37.341 --> 11:38.408
She needed my advice.

11:38.709 --> 11:39.744
About what?

11:40.645 --> 11:43.081
I don't know.
It's probably no big deal.

11:45.282 --> 11:46.683
When you kept secrets
from your father,

11:46.684 --> 11:47.785
was it not a big deal?

11:50.386 --> 11:51.989
You know,
I'm not even gonna ask.

11:53.690 --> 11:54.991
That's the building
on the right-hand side.

11:54.992 --> 11:56.127
- Right there.
- Okay.

11:56.428 --> 11:57.063
Let's go get 'em.

11:57.264 --> 11:58.864
Not you. Us.

12:00.164 --> 12:02.399
Apartment 801?
- Okay. Thanks.

12:03.400 --> 12:04.368
So it turns out that the building's

12:04.369 --> 12:06.738
only asian tenant is Paul Cho,

12:06.839 --> 12:09.706
who just happens to be
Buckley's ex-brother-in-law.

12:09.707 --> 12:12.076
Oh, well, maybe it's not "Cape Fear" then.

12:12.077 --> 12:14.912
Maybe it's "Family Feud."
maybe Buckley's bitter divorce

12:14.913 --> 12:17.281
caused enough hard feelings
that things turned violent?

12:22.719 --> 12:25.622
I don't understand.
I haven't seen Jack in months.

12:26.123 --> 12:27.658
Not since he divorced my sister.

12:28.259 --> 12:29.492
Really?

12:29.493 --> 12:30.961
Because I have an eyewitness

12:30.962 --> 12:33.597
who saw the two of you arguing
yesterday morning.

12:34.198 --> 12:36.268
So that means you're lying to me.

12:36.469 --> 12:38.069
She hates being lied to.

12:38.169 --> 12:39.903
I don't know
what you're talking about.

12:40.004 --> 12:41.739
Great. Let's go down
to the precinct.

12:41.740 --> 12:42.574
I'll arrange a perp walk,

12:42.575 --> 12:44.377
and you can put on
a show for the cameras.

12:45.178 --> 12:46.278
Love a good perp walk.

12:46.978 --> 12:48.046
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

12:52.950 --> 12:54.017
The night before last,

12:54.018 --> 12:55.920
I was attacked by a man
in a ski mask.

12:56.621 --> 12:59.289
He warned me to tell Buckley
to back off Danton

12:59.290 --> 13:00.358
or he would ruin me.

13:00.859 --> 13:01.859
Who's Danton?

13:01.959 --> 13:04.027
I don't know,
but Jack definitely knew him.

13:04.328 --> 13:06.430
He said he wasn't gonna
let him get away with this.

13:06.831 --> 13:08.066
That's why we were fighting.

13:09.067 --> 13:10.703
I told Jack to listen
for once in his life.

13:11.504 --> 13:13.905
- He had to protect me.
- From what?

13:14.606 --> 13:16.207
That's none of your business.

13:16.408 --> 13:17.608
Perp walk it is.

13:17.708 --> 13:18.643
All right, all right.

13:20.744 --> 13:22.512
I have a...

13:22.913 --> 13:24.515
slight fondness...

13:25.916 --> 13:27.152
for girls.

13:30.053 --> 13:31.254
Young girls?

13:33.190 --> 13:34.524
Fat girls?

13:37.628 --> 13:40.296
Schoolgirls?

13:40.797 --> 13:42.165
Call girls.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.466
Oh.

13:43.966 --> 13:45.869
Who else knows about this fondness?

13:46.270 --> 13:47.371
Just the girls.

13:47.372 --> 13:50.907
Actually, the girls... and their pimp.

13:51.808 --> 13:54.377
Whose name is probably Danton.

13:54.378 --> 13:56.880
O-okay, fine.
But I wasn't really lying.

13:56.881 --> 13:59.117
I-I've actually never met Danton.

13:59.118 --> 14:02.486
Uh, I got the phone number
for the Agency from a friend.

14:02.487 --> 14:04.789
I call it, and they send over a girl.

14:06.590 --> 14:10.693
So Buckley is investigating
Danton's call girl ring.

14:10.894 --> 14:11.895
When Danton discovers

14:11.896 --> 14:13.397
that Buckley's brother-in-law
is a client,

14:13.398 --> 14:16.200
he sends a message... back off
or your family gets hurt.

14:16.201 --> 14:18.135
And then when Buckley
doesn't back down,

14:18.136 --> 14:19.603
Danton kills him.

14:20.004 --> 14:21.505
So how do we find Danton?

14:22.506 --> 14:23.609
We talk to one of the call girls.

14:27.812 --> 14:30.014
Call that number and tell him
to bring one of his girls over.

14:30.215 --> 14:32.417
And tell her to wear something sexy.

14:34.318 --> 14:36.220
No reason we can't enjoy
this interview.

14:41.158 --> 14:42.058
Hey, Paul.

14:42.059 --> 14:43.827
Couldn't wait to see me, huh?

14:49.600 --> 14:51.368
Actually, I'm the one
who asked for the date.

14:52.769 --> 14:54.704
Isn't that the girl
from Buckley's office?

14:56.474 --> 14:58.175
Did she look like that before?

15:04.876 --> 15:06.710
So how exactly does a call girl

15:06.711 --> 15:08.812
end up working for
Jack Buckley, super DA?

15:09.313 --> 15:10.647
Am I under arrest?

15:10.648 --> 15:12.650
You will be if you don't
answer the question.

15:14.451 --> 15:16.186
Jack was a client.

15:17.187 --> 15:19.022
I-I'm sorry, Scarlett.
I don't believe that.

15:19.523 --> 15:21.992
I started seeing him about a year ago.

15:22.993 --> 15:24.928
He hadn't been with anyone
since his divorce.

15:25.929 --> 15:28.232
He was just lonely, you know?

15:29.433 --> 15:31.436
We'd spend
most of his dates talking.

15:33.337 --> 15:34.871
He'd take me to fancy restaurants...

15:35.672 --> 15:38.041
Even though I told him
he didn't have to.

15:38.842 --> 15:40.243
But I think he wanted
to make it feel

15:40.244 --> 15:41.779
as normal as possible.

15:43.380 --> 15:44.981
Then one night, he saw...

15:44.982 --> 15:47.117
a law book in my bag.

15:48.118 --> 15:51.455
I told him I was only
working as an escort

15:51.456 --> 15:53.590
to pay my way through law school.

15:54.591 --> 15:57.460
A few months later, he said
he had an internship

15:57.461 --> 15:59.096
opening up in his office.

16:01.097 --> 16:02.332
Would I be interested?

16:03.633 --> 16:05.770
He wanted to help you escape the life?

16:07.371 --> 16:08.571
Who's Danton?

16:08.872 --> 16:11.374
- I don't know.
- Don't lie to us, Scarlett.

16:11.375 --> 16:12.309
I'm not.

16:13.210 --> 16:16.613
I-I know he runs the business,
but I've never met him.

16:17.014 --> 16:19.149
It's not like I'm a streetwalker

16:19.150 --> 16:22.452
and he's in a fedora
and a long fur coat.

16:22.753 --> 16:25.521
He's organized the entire operation

16:25.622 --> 16:27.257
to protect his identity.

16:27.758 --> 16:29.693
The girls are independent contractors.

16:29.994 --> 16:31.995
The clients are all given numbers

16:31.996 --> 16:33.531
so we don't know their last names.

16:34.332 --> 16:36.300
They pay the business by credit card.

16:37.301 --> 16:41.804
And our fees get deposited
directly into our bank accounts.

16:41.805 --> 16:43.306
Creating the perfect firewall

16:43.307 --> 16:44.808
between the girls and the management.

16:44.809 --> 16:47.344
So then when we arrest you,
you can't give up Danton.

16:48.245 --> 16:49.946
Because I don't know who he is.

16:55.986 --> 16:58.021
I can't believe Jack Buckley
was seeing prostitutes.

16:58.722 --> 17:01.056
Yeah, well, he worked
14 hours a day,

17:01.057 --> 17:02.225
didn't have a social life.

17:03.226 --> 17:04.961
Maybe he just wanted
a little easy company.

17:05.362 --> 17:07.330
Well, the math
just doesn't add up, though.

17:08.432 --> 17:10.333
Buckley was warned to back off Danton.

17:10.434 --> 17:11.834
Why would Buckley be investigating

17:11.835 --> 17:13.470
a call girl service he was using?

17:13.971 --> 17:16.705
Maybe Danton tried to blackmail
Buckley, and it backfired.

17:17.406 --> 17:20.510
So then Danton
tried to scare Buckley

17:21.011 --> 17:22.412
by threatening his brother-in-law.

17:22.413 --> 17:24.348
And then when that didn't work,
Danton killed Buckley.

17:24.348 --> 17:26.549
All right. Let's find out everything
we can about this Danton character.

17:26.617 --> 17:28.653
Have Ryan and Esposito reach out
to Vice in the morning.

17:28.654 --> 17:29.654
Yes, sir.

17:30.354 --> 17:32.823
Castle, I need you to sign
these charges against Jessup

17:32.824 --> 17:33.992
so I can send him downtown.

17:38.528 --> 17:39.862
What?

17:41.465 --> 17:43.499
No, don't tell me you've got
a soft spot for this guy.

17:43.800 --> 17:44.969
He's a wordsmith.

17:46.370 --> 17:48.271
Okay. Fine.

17:49.807 --> 17:50.907
Hi, it's Beckett.

17:51.108 --> 17:53.076
Uh, charges are being dropped
against Jessup.

17:53.077 --> 17:54.046
Process him out.

17:54.247 --> 17:55.347
All right. Thank you.

17:56.847 --> 17:59.183
I hope the two of you
are very happy together.

18:03.319 --> 18:04.120
Are you okay?

18:04.721 --> 18:07.090
No. I... broke a heel.

18:07.991 --> 18:08.692
Let me guess.

18:08.693 --> 18:10.427
They were your favorite pair,

18:10.728 --> 18:12.729
passed through your family
for generations.

18:13.930 --> 18:15.898
My great-great-grandmother
wore them over

18:15.899 --> 18:16.799
on the "Mayflower."

18:16.900 --> 18:17.669
I knew it.

18:19.970 --> 18:21.938
So what's a nice girl like you...

18:22.939 --> 18:25.175
Really?
That's your line?

18:25.476 --> 18:26.410
I'm old-fashioned.

18:28.811 --> 18:32.248
I came to New York
in this ancient blue Beetle.

18:32.549 --> 18:33.718
The floor was so rusted,

18:33.719 --> 18:35.820
it literally sagged in the middle.

18:36.221 --> 18:39.756
But I can still remember
coming over the bridge

18:39.757 --> 18:42.859
and seeing the city
right there in front of me.

18:43.060 --> 18:45.895
I thought everything
was gonna be perfect.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.866
Something tells me this story
takes a turn for the worse.

18:49.767 --> 18:52.702
The first night, uh,
somebody broke into my car

18:52.803 --> 18:55.238
and stole all my stuff.

18:55.639 --> 18:58.907
Then the college friend
I was gonna stay with

18:58.908 --> 19:01.177
told me her boyfriend was moving in.

19:01.178 --> 19:03.846
- I had to find another place.
- Ooh.

19:03.947 --> 19:06.082
But somehow, I survived.

19:06.783 --> 19:08.551
Spent a year barely eating,

19:08.852 --> 19:10.086
living in a closet.

19:10.787 --> 19:12.388
When a friend mentioned doing this,

19:12.389 --> 19:15.525
I thought... couldn't be worse.

19:16.626 --> 19:17.760
And is it?

19:19.261 --> 19:20.396
Mostly no.

19:24.701 --> 19:26.169
Thanks for listening.

19:32.542 --> 19:33.877
Good night, Castle.

19:34.378 --> 19:36.079
- You going to meet Alexis?
- Yeah.

19:36.080 --> 19:36.715
Can I come?

19:38.216 --> 19:38.816
No.

19:38.916 --> 19:40.050
But I want to.

19:41.251 --> 19:42.752
Why are you so worried, Castle?

19:42.753 --> 19:44.322
I thought you were the cool Dad.

19:47.323 --> 19:48.559
I am.

19:54.130 --> 19:55.131
What's the secret?

19:55.732 --> 19:57.367
All in the breathing, dear.

19:57.968 --> 19:59.268
No, what's Alexis' secret

19:59.269 --> 20:00.970
that she'll tell Beckett about
but not me?

20:00.971 --> 20:03.306
I don't know.
There are some things a woman

20:03.507 --> 20:05.609
wants to talk to another woman about.

20:05.610 --> 20:06.410
The "New York Times"

20:06.510 --> 20:08.645
praised the depth
of my female characters.

20:08.746 --> 20:11.314
I know. And I couldn't be prouder.

20:11.515 --> 20:12.682
But this is real life.

20:12.683 --> 20:15.284
And obviously,
Alexis looks up to Beckett.

20:15.285 --> 20:17.554
And Beckett's smart and strong
and independent.

20:17.555 --> 20:18.455
So are you.

20:18.555 --> 20:20.356
That's sweet. Mm.

20:20.557 --> 20:22.258
I'm on the wrong side of 40

20:22.259 --> 20:23.994
for what Alexis
is going through right now.

20:24.295 --> 20:25.195
40?

20:25.295 --> 20:26.563
Deflect all you want, kiddo,

20:26.564 --> 20:28.565
but I recognize the fear in your eyes.

20:28.766 --> 20:31.202
You're afraid Alexis has
more Rick Castle in her

20:31.203 --> 20:31.939
than you thought.

20:33.440 --> 20:36.440
Hey, sweetie. How did
your talk with Beckett, go?

20:36.640 --> 20:38.241
Fine. She's really nice.

20:38.542 --> 20:40.143
Yeah, she is.

20:41.244 --> 20:42.645
You know, sweetheart,
if you don't want to tell me

20:42.646 --> 20:44.282
what you talked about
with Beckett, you don't have to.

20:44.583 --> 20:46.083
Okay. Thanks, dad.

20:48.652 --> 20:51.187
What is the matter with you?

20:51.188 --> 20:52.522
Why didn't you just ask her?

20:52.523 --> 20:55.825
Because that would be prying,
and cool dads don't do that.

20:56.226 --> 20:57.594
They go behind
their daughter's back,

20:57.595 --> 20:58.696
and they beg Beckett to tell 'em.

21:02.199 --> 21:04.534
- You ever have any cases with Buckley?
- A few.

21:04.535 --> 21:06.203
Guy was wound a little tight
if you ask me.

21:06.304 --> 21:08.405
Saw himself
as a crusader for justice.

21:08.506 --> 21:09.807
Yo, Esposito.

21:10.008 --> 21:11.608
Gil Mazzara.
What's up, man?

21:11.708 --> 21:12.577
How you doing?

21:12.578 --> 21:14.378
So you still looking at
dirty pictures up in Vice?

21:14.478 --> 21:16.280
Yeah, tell your mom
to send over some new ones.

21:16.281 --> 21:17.483
The ones I got are getting old.

21:18.284 --> 21:19.286
You know my partner... Ryan?

21:19.987 --> 21:22.687
Yeah. Honey milk.
Nice to see you.

21:23.287 --> 21:26.055
So, uh, I hear you're
looking to talk about Danton.

21:26.456 --> 21:28.325
- Yeah. You know him?
- Yeah, I arrested him five years ago.

21:28.326 --> 21:30.326
Real name's Dan Tonelli.

21:30.527 --> 21:32.061
Dan-ton.

21:32.062 --> 21:33.197
- Yeah.
- He's currently serving

21:33.198 --> 21:35.332
a 7-year stretch
in Green Haven Correctional.

21:35.933 --> 21:37.334
Wait a minute.
He's still in prison?

21:37.735 --> 21:39.503
And your boy Buckley put him there.

21:39.704 --> 21:40.804
Buckley prosecuted Danton?

21:41.104 --> 21:43.906
Yeah. And he was all over us
to make a rock-solid case.

21:44.407 --> 21:46.810
We gave Buckley enough to put
the guy away for 20 years.

21:47.811 --> 21:49.480
Could Tonelli still be running
the operation out of prison?

21:49.481 --> 21:50.481
Nah.

21:50.781 --> 21:52.882
These call girl rings
are like franchises.

21:52.983 --> 21:55.218
The business changes hands,
but the name stays the same.

21:55.619 --> 21:56.819
So who's the new Danton?

21:57.220 --> 21:59.622
I wish I knew.
Guy's like a ghost.

22:00.123 --> 22:02.325
Every time we think we're
getting close, he disappears.

22:02.726 --> 22:05.428
Five warrants in the last year,
and every time we show up,

22:05.429 --> 22:07.399
the place has been cleared out
like he knew we were coming.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.300
You call the prison. Get 'em
to bring Tonelli over here.

22:11.000 --> 22:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

22:18.308 --> 22:19.676
Hey. You guys seen Beckett?

22:20.177 --> 22:22.745
She went with the Captain
to update City Hall on the case.

22:22.746 --> 22:23.947
She'll be here in a minute.

22:24.348 --> 22:25.148
Something wrong?

22:25.248 --> 22:26.850
No. Yes.

22:27.951 --> 22:30.653
I think my daughter might be
keeping something from me.

22:30.854 --> 22:32.255
Maybe she got kicked outta school.

22:32.256 --> 22:33.056
What?

22:33.156 --> 22:36.258
- Or she's doing drugs.
- Mm-hmm. Teen pregnancy is on the rise.

22:36.359 --> 22:38.795
Whoa. All right,
you've met my daughter.

22:38.896 --> 22:40.864
You know that she is
the closest thing to perfect

22:40.865 --> 22:41.799
as humanly possible.

22:42.800 --> 22:45.502
Castle, come on. You've been
with us long enough to know

22:45.503 --> 22:47.004
that people are never
who you think they are.

22:47.105 --> 22:49.039
Isn't it possible
your perfect daughter

22:49.040 --> 22:50.642
Isn't as perfect as you think?

22:50.943 --> 22:52.343
Is Danton here yet?

22:52.643 --> 22:54.010
Yep. Interrogation room one.

22:54.811 --> 22:55.879
Wait, Danton?

22:56.180 --> 22:57.482
Come on, Castle. Keep up.

22:59.583 --> 23:01.952
We brought you in here
to talk about Danton.

23:02.653 --> 23:03.853
Ancient history.

23:04.054 --> 23:06.789
It says here, Buckley made
a plea deal with you...

23:06.790 --> 23:08.291
7 years instead of 20.

23:08.292 --> 23:10.793
But I heard
Buckley doesn't make deals.

23:11.094 --> 23:12.662
What could I say? I got lucky.

23:12.963 --> 23:15.597
The only reason that Buckley
would agree to a deal

23:15.598 --> 23:17.600
is because you brought him
something big in return.

23:17.801 --> 23:18.734
So what was it?

23:18.935 --> 23:20.070
Why don't you ask him?

23:20.471 --> 23:21.471
Because he's dead.

23:21.871 --> 23:23.839
What? How?

23:23.840 --> 23:25.875
He was murdered two nights ago.

23:26.076 --> 23:29.111
We believe that the same person
who took over your operations killed him.

23:31.948 --> 23:32.916
What's so funny?

23:33.117 --> 23:35.686
Well, you see, that would
make it a suicide.

23:35.987 --> 23:37.087
Suicide?

23:37.788 --> 23:41.288
Wait a minute. You're saying that
Jack Buckley was the new Danton?

23:42.425 --> 23:43.593
Buckley made me a deal.

23:43.994 --> 23:46.797
I provide him with
my client list, my girls,

23:46.898 --> 23:48.732
he knocks 13 years off my sentence.

23:48.733 --> 23:50.103
It was a no-brainer.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.404
Our DA was a pimp.

23:55.083 --> 23:56.183
Jack Buckley was Danton.

23:56.484 --> 23:58.185
That's why all vice's warrants failed.

23:58.486 --> 23:59.854
They had to go through the DA's office,

23:59.855 --> 24:00.788
and Buckley saw them coming.

24:00.789 --> 24:02.957
He was in the perfect position
to protect his operation.

24:03.358 --> 24:07.060
But why would a respected
prosecutor become a pimp?

24:07.061 --> 24:08.095
The outfits.

24:08.496 --> 24:09.596
It was the money.

24:10.296 --> 24:11.964
Buckley's ex-wife
took him to the cleaners.

24:11.965 --> 24:13.766
Between alimony and his own bills,

24:13.767 --> 24:15.168
Buckley was beyond broke.

24:15.469 --> 24:17.370
You know what? I'm bettin' it was
more than just the money.

24:17.671 --> 24:20.206
Everybody's talking about
how great Jack Buckley was,

24:20.307 --> 24:21.808
<i>How he was the law.</i>

24:21.909 --> 24:22.943
You start thinking like that,

24:23.944 --> 24:26.647
sometimes you can start thinking
maybe you are above the law,

24:26.848 --> 24:28.116
that you can get away with anything.

24:29.717 --> 24:31.119
Sir, how did the Mayor handle the news?

24:31.120 --> 24:32.520
Whew. You don't want to know.

24:33.120 --> 24:35.288
Okay, this doesn't make any sense.

24:35.689 --> 24:39.191
If Buckley was the new Danton,
then why would the masked man

24:39.192 --> 24:40.760
tell Buckley to back off of Danton?

24:40.761 --> 24:42.362
Buckley wouldn't threaten himself.

24:45.198 --> 24:46.833
Unless Buckley wasn't the boss anymore.

24:46.834 --> 24:48.602
- A hostile takeover.
- Of course.

24:48.903 --> 24:51.670
We know Danton was just
a business name.

24:51.671 --> 24:53.172
So "back off of Danton"

24:53.273 --> 24:54.941
was the new boss telling the old boss,

24:55.142 --> 24:56.543
"don't resist the takeover

24:56.544 --> 24:57.846
or I'll start ruining reputations."

24:57.847 --> 24:59.547
Makes sense in theory,
but how do you prove it?

25:00.447 --> 25:01.715
We talk to the call girl.

25:04.484 --> 25:05.385
There is no way

25:05.386 --> 25:07.721
that Scarlett didn't know
that Buckley was in charge.

25:10.991 --> 25:13.659
No, seriously, what did
Alexis tell you last night?

25:14.360 --> 25:16.195
I promised I wouldn't say.

25:16.196 --> 25:18.231
Well, at least tell me
if it was bad.

25:18.432 --> 25:19.933
And put you out of your misery?

25:23.470 --> 25:24.638
We're looking for Scarlett.

25:26.239 --> 25:28.074
We can't have call girls working here.

25:28.075 --> 25:29.276
No, only pimps.

25:30.377 --> 25:31.545
Detective.

25:33.346 --> 25:34.748
Could you give us a moment, please?

25:38.985 --> 25:40.553
Scarlett, you lied to us.

25:40.954 --> 25:42.888
Buckley was running
the call girl ring,

25:42.889 --> 25:44.458
and there's no way
that you didn't know.

25:46.159 --> 25:47.659
Please. I had to lie.

25:47.660 --> 25:49.428
He'd kill me if he thought
I told you anything.

25:49.429 --> 25:50.997
Who'd kill you, the new Danton?

25:51.098 --> 25:53.233
Someone took over Buckley's
business. Who was it?

25:54.234 --> 25:55.136
Answer me.

25:56.037 --> 25:57.437
He used to work for Buckley.

25:57.737 --> 26:00.340
He made sure no one hurt
the girls and everyone paid.

26:00.341 --> 26:01.341
What was his name?

26:01.441 --> 26:02.609
I can't tell you that.

26:02.610 --> 26:03.810
Scarlett, I'm done playing.

26:03.910 --> 26:06.112
You've done nothing but lie
to us. Don't think that I'm not

26:06.113 --> 26:07.981
gonna send you away
for obstruction of justice

26:07.982 --> 26:09.251
and anything else that I can think of.

26:09.752 --> 26:10.952
He'll kill me.

26:11.052 --> 26:12.054
We won't let that happen.

26:12.955 --> 26:14.255
Detective Beckett can help you,

26:14.355 --> 26:15.523
but you have to help us first.

26:15.724 --> 26:16.824
And then what happens to me?

26:17.624 --> 26:19.193
You think I'm gonna be a lawyer now?

26:19.594 --> 26:21.629
Jack was gonna write me
a letter of recommendation,

26:22.030 --> 26:23.364
pull some strings to get me a job.

26:23.565 --> 26:24.934
Who's gonna help me now?

26:24.935 --> 26:27.135
Honestly? No one.

26:28.235 --> 26:29.603
You're gonna have to do it
by yourself, Scarlett.

26:29.604 --> 26:30.739
And I got a feeling that you can.

26:31.540 --> 26:33.475
Tell us who the new boss is...

26:35.776 --> 26:36.977
and Detective Beckett will make sure

26:36.978 --> 26:38.613
no one knows
it was you who talked to us.

26:41.614 --> 26:42.649
You promise?

26:47.353 --> 26:48.587
Yes.

26:50.488 --> 26:51.824
His name is John Knox.

26:52.525 --> 26:54.127
Knox? But that's...

26:54.128 --> 26:56.464
The guy that Buckley
dragged in here in handcuffs.

26:58.765 --> 27:01.900
How does a prosecutor get into
business with a criminal?

27:02.701 --> 27:04.102
Well, it's hard out there
for a pimp...

27:04.403 --> 27:05.404
Who's also a DA

27:06.205 --> 27:08.041
Ooh, that'd be
a good character for a novel.

27:08.042 --> 27:08.942
Mm.

27:09.042 --> 27:10.776
A star prosecutor
who's always excelled

27:10.777 --> 27:11.778
at anything he's ever done...

27:11.979 --> 27:13.880
he couldn't possibly imagine
that being a pimp

27:13.881 --> 27:15.982
would be a bigger job
than he could handle by himself.

27:16.083 --> 27:17.251
But one day he gets a call...

27:17.352 --> 27:19.454
one of his girls has been
knocked around by a client.

27:19.955 --> 27:21.923
He realizes there's nothing
he can do about it.

27:22.024 --> 27:23.725
- He's a very public figure.
- Mm-hmm.

27:23.726 --> 27:26.327
So a white-collar prosecutor
decides to hire

27:26.328 --> 27:28.263
a blue-collared enforcer.

27:28.964 --> 27:30.766
Can't exactly take out an ad
on craigslist for that,

27:30.767 --> 27:33.734
but fortunately enough,
he has a big stack

27:33.735 --> 27:36.304
of qualified candidates
sitting right on his desk.

27:36.305 --> 27:38.205
Which is where he found John Knox,

27:38.305 --> 27:40.607
a criminal who mostly managed
to stay out of prison.

27:40.608 --> 27:42.108
Which makes him a smart criminal.

27:42.208 --> 27:43.576
- Yeah.
- Buckley offers him a deal...

27:43.677 --> 27:45.711
"come work for me,
I'll throw your case."

27:45.912 --> 27:47.246
- And Knox does.
- Mm-hmm.

27:47.247 --> 27:48.914
For a while, everyone's happy.

27:48.915 --> 27:50.216
But then Knox decides

27:50.217 --> 27:51.851
he's not happy
being number two anymore.

27:52.052 --> 27:54.787
He takes Buckley's client list,
tells Buckley to take a hike.

27:54.788 --> 27:56.722
Knowing that Buckley
can't do anything about it

27:56.723 --> 27:58.458
- without risking exposure.
- Mm-hmm.

27:58.459 --> 28:01.027
But Buckley's never backed down
from a fight in his life.

28:01.228 --> 28:03.230
He gets the cops to drag Knox
down to his office

28:03.231 --> 28:05.366
- to remind him who's boss.
- But Knox took it up a notch,

28:05.367 --> 28:07.534
sending a warning shot
across Buckley's bow

28:07.535 --> 28:10.437
- by threatening his brother-in-law.
- And when Buckley wouldn't back down,

28:10.538 --> 28:12.574
Knox threw him off the roof
of a parking garage.

28:12.975 --> 28:14.475
Jeez, if only we had some proof.

28:14.575 --> 28:16.744
Who needs proof?
What a great story.

28:17.445 --> 28:19.546
Of course, Knox has an alibi.

28:21.147 --> 28:22.115
You know, maybe you're right.

28:23.216 --> 28:26.619
Maybe Knox is smart.
Maybe he sent someone else.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.121
Ooh, I like the twist...

28:28.122 --> 28:29.889
The enforcer has an enforcer.

28:31.390 --> 28:32.191
But who?

28:32.792 --> 28:34.127
♪♪

28:34.128 --> 28:36.096
No, it worked out well.
It was good.

28:36.097 --> 28:38.532
You know, I'll talk
to you guys later, okay?

28:40.333 --> 28:42.368
Hi. Remember us?

28:42.969 --> 28:44.470
I definitely remember you.

28:44.671 --> 28:46.739
We need to ask you
a few questions.

28:46.840 --> 28:48.507
I already answered your questions.

28:48.708 --> 28:50.243
Maybe you didn't see the badge.

28:50.444 --> 28:52.178
Oh, I saw it.

28:53.279 --> 28:55.347
You ladies ready?
Excellent.

28:56.348 --> 28:57.850
You two have a nice evening.

28:57.851 --> 29:00.852
Who's hungry?
What do you guys feel like?

29:00.853 --> 29:01.988
Aren't you gonna stop him?

29:02.489 --> 29:05.391
I can't. Unless we arrest him,

29:05.392 --> 29:07.527
the law says that he doesn't
have to talk to us,

29:07.528 --> 29:09.662
- and he knows that.
- So arrest him.

29:09.663 --> 29:11.130
On what grounds?

29:11.531 --> 29:14.733
We promised Scarlett
that we'd keep her out of it.

29:15.134 --> 29:16.269
So unless we get some evidence,

29:16.270 --> 29:17.604
he's getting away with this.

29:32.118 --> 29:33.218
Scarlett?

29:34.287 --> 29:35.788
You're hurt.

29:35.889 --> 29:37.825
I didn't know where else to go.

29:42.412 --> 29:43.980
Come. Sit down.

29:47.249 --> 29:48.451
You should go to a hospital.

29:49.352 --> 29:51.487
It's just a few bruises.
I'll be fine.

29:52.188 --> 29:53.389
How did you find me?

29:54.490 --> 29:56.525
A client in the publishing business

29:56.526 --> 29:57.495
gave me your address.

29:59.796 --> 30:00.897
Dinner for one?

30:01.498 --> 30:03.699
Yeah, my family is at the theater.

30:03.700 --> 30:05.134
Good.

30:05.135 --> 30:07.738
I wouldn't want anyone else
to see me like this.

30:11.274 --> 30:12.809
Did Knox do this to you?

30:14.478 --> 30:15.578
It doesn't matter.

30:15.678 --> 30:16.612
Of course it does.

30:16.613 --> 30:18.081
Do you think that by protecting him,

30:18.082 --> 30:20.284
you're saving yourself somehow?
Because you're not.

30:21.685 --> 30:23.553
And if you don't get out
from under his thumb now,

30:23.554 --> 30:24.689
you never will.

30:27.390 --> 30:29.325
Why are you so nice to me?

30:29.426 --> 30:30.993
How do you know I'm not this nice

30:30.994 --> 30:32.863
to all the beautiful women
I find on my doorstep?

30:35.064 --> 30:36.832
You really think I'm beautiful?

30:38.033 --> 30:40.103
Look, maybe we should...

30:43.907 --> 30:45.242
- I'm sorry.
- No.

30:45.243 --> 30:47.344
- I shouldn't have done that.
- It's okay. It's...

30:49.345 --> 30:51.747
You're hurt and you're scared.

30:53.448 --> 30:55.785
But you don't have to be
that person with me.

30:57.920 --> 30:59.255
You're safe here.

31:04.660 --> 31:06.295
Knox killed Buckley.

31:06.296 --> 31:08.998
No. No, he has an alibi.

31:16.939 --> 31:17.907
The Reverend?

31:18.308 --> 31:19.942
Knox made me take it.

31:21.043 --> 31:23.145
Reverend Daniel is a client.

31:23.546 --> 31:25.881
Knox is blackmailing him into saying

31:25.882 --> 31:27.917
they were together
when Buckley was killed.

31:29.218 --> 31:30.786
Thank you.

31:31.587 --> 31:34.490
Now I'm taking you
to a hospital. No arguments.

31:34.491 --> 31:35.691
Okay.

31:38.361 --> 31:39.528
Hey.

31:39.729 --> 31:41.864
I'm thinking Knox killed Buckley.

31:42.365 --> 31:43.332
Knox has an alibi.

31:43.333 --> 31:45.134
Hmm, does he?

31:45.135 --> 31:49.238
Reverend alibi in the flesh...
lots of flesh...

31:50.239 --> 31:51.840
Too much flesh.

31:52.241 --> 31:54.310
- Where'd you get this?
- Scarlett Price.

31:54.911 --> 31:56.145
You saw her without me?

31:56.146 --> 31:57.947
Uh, well, yes.

31:57.948 --> 32:00.116
She's a person of interest
in our investigation,

32:00.117 --> 32:02.452
<i>- Our murder investigation.
- No, I know.</i>

32:02.453 --> 32:05.621
- Where'd you see her?
- Uh... My apartment.

32:05.622 --> 32:06.124
What?

32:06.125 --> 32:08.425
When I came home last night,
she was in my hall,

32:08.525 --> 32:10.393
- and somebody had beaten her up.
- And you didn't think to call me?

32:10.394 --> 32:11.328
Well, I took her to the hospital.

32:11.329 --> 32:13.698
The night kinda got away
from me, and then I came here,

32:13.699 --> 32:15.935
You know, to surprise you
like... like I do.

32:17.236 --> 32:19.036
We are not done talking about this.

32:20.736 --> 32:21.470
Esposito.

32:21.471 --> 32:23.239
- Yeah.
- Have surveillance pull in Knox.

32:23.240 --> 32:25.775
- On it.
- Whoa. You had Knox under surveillance

32:25.776 --> 32:26.512
and you didn't tell me?

32:27.113 --> 32:28.913
At least I didn't go out
on a date with him.

32:29.013 --> 32:31.214
- It wasn't a date.
- Really?

32:31.215 --> 32:33.716
Trouble.
Knox's apartment is empty.

32:33.717 --> 32:35.318
He must have slipped out
during the night.

32:35.519 --> 32:36.686
Scarlett...

32:36.687 --> 32:37.988
I left her
at St. Vincent's Hospital.

32:40.189 --> 32:42.391
Yes. Hello. I dropped a young
woman off there last night.

32:42.392 --> 32:43.827
Her name is Scarlett Price.
She'd been beaten up.

32:43.828 --> 32:45.163
I need to speak to her
right away, please.

32:46.664 --> 32:48.064
What? When?

32:48.464 --> 32:49.698
Thank you.

32:49.699 --> 32:51.335
A man checked her out
right after I left.

32:51.336 --> 32:52.436
Knox.

32:52.636 --> 32:54.203
Get a unit out to Scarlett's apartment

32:54.204 --> 32:55.306
and get an APB out on both of them.

32:59.175 --> 33:00.876
- Hello.
- He's got me.

33:00.977 --> 33:02.611
Scarlett, hang on, hang on.

33:02.612 --> 33:04.714
I think he's gonna kill me.

33:04.715 --> 33:06.616
- Where are you?
- I don't know. I...

33:06.717 --> 33:08.152
Hey, what are you doing in there?!

33:08.453 --> 33:09.453
Scarlett.

33:10.153 --> 33:11.988
What do we do?
We have to do something?

33:12.789 --> 33:14.323
Ryan, get the carrier on the phone.

33:14.424 --> 33:16.025
Let 'em know that I'm about
a minute away

33:16.026 --> 33:17.894
from getting a trace warrant
on the following number...

33:17.895 --> 33:21.229
212-555-0179.

33:21.230 --> 33:22.965
Got it.

33:22.966 --> 33:27.069
This is Detective Kate Beckett,
badge number 4-1-3-1-9.

33:27.070 --> 33:29.205
I need to talk
to Judge Beall right away.

33:29.506 --> 33:31.573
Scarlett's phone traced
to the East Side of the building.

33:31.643 --> 33:34.044
Hotel manager said that a guy
matching Knox's description

33:34.145 --> 33:36.213
checked into room 4-F this morning.

33:36.714 --> 33:38.014
Castle, you're staying here.

33:38.114 --> 33:39.250
No, I'm not.

33:42.051 --> 33:43.719
Okay, but stay behind me.

33:53.228 --> 33:54.162
Stop! No!

33:58.643 --> 34:00.211
Police!

34:07.685 --> 34:09.286
Over there. It's Knox.

34:11.856 --> 34:12.789
Scarlett.

34:13.590 --> 34:14.757
Hey. Hey.

34:14.958 --> 34:16.161
Hey, it's okay.

34:18.661 --> 34:19.862
I killed him.

34:20.164 --> 34:21.197
It's okay. You're okay.

34:21.998 --> 34:23.234
I killed Knox.

34:24.435 --> 34:26.902
He heard a noise outside,
and wh...

34:26.904 --> 34:28.906
And when he turned to look,
I grabbed his gun.

34:29.907 --> 34:32.743
He told me to give it back.
He came after me.

34:33.744 --> 34:35.647
I told him to stop, but he wouldn't.

34:37.047 --> 34:38.384
Why wouldn't he stop?

34:41.784 --> 34:43.154
Why wouldn't he stop?

34:53.731 --> 34:55.366
You think she'll be okay?

34:56.367 --> 34:57.634
Well, given the circumstances,

34:57.635 --> 34:59.202
I don't think the DA
will press charges.

34:59.503 --> 35:01.672
<i>No, I mean, do you think
she'll be okay?</i>

35:03.073 --> 35:04.207
I don't know.

35:06.010 --> 35:07.377
Girls in the sex industry

35:07.378 --> 35:10.080
usually come from a history
of childhood dysfunction.

35:10.281 --> 35:11.648
It's hard to escape that.

35:12.549 --> 35:14.084
But it's possible, right?

35:15.785 --> 35:16.753
Yeah.

35:17.554 --> 35:18.355
Hold it right there!

35:18.556 --> 35:19.890
Castle, little help?

35:20.491 --> 35:22.593
Oh, yeah. Julian, it's fine.
He's with me.

35:22.594 --> 35:23.694
You are outta control, man.

35:24.995 --> 35:27.430
I got good news. I finally
found a locksmith school

35:27.431 --> 35:28.832
- that's willing to admit me.
- Really?

35:28.833 --> 35:31.568
Yeah. All I need is a letter of
recommendation from the police,

35:31.569 --> 35:33.571
And I am in.
Will you write it for me?

35:33.572 --> 35:34.872
No!

35:34.972 --> 35:36.807
- What?
- Come on. Have a heart.

35:36.808 --> 35:39.076
He's a criminal.
If I write him a letter,

35:39.077 --> 35:41.713
I'll be responsible for him. I
cannot watch you 24 hours a day.

35:41.914 --> 35:43.014
Wait a minute.
What'd you say?

35:43.114 --> 35:44.515
I would be responsible for him.

35:44.716 --> 35:47.017
No, no, no.
You can't watch him...

35:47.218 --> 35:49.453
When did you put
the surveillance car on Knox?

35:49.454 --> 35:51.822
- Right after we left the bar.
- And they followed him all night?

35:51.823 --> 35:53.725
Yeah. He got home around 2:00 am

35:53.926 --> 35:55.426
Then how could he
have beaten up Scarlett?

35:55.826 --> 35:57.294
You guys do know that the deadbolt

35:57.295 --> 35:59.330
wasn set on this lock when
you guys kicked it in, right?

35:59.431 --> 36:00.331
What?

36:00.431 --> 36:02.666
See? If it would've been,

36:02.667 --> 36:04.301
this whole frame
would've been destroyed.

36:04.602 --> 36:07.805
Locking the door...
that's hostage taking 101.

36:09.406 --> 36:11.942
Unless Scarlett wasn't a hostage.

36:12.743 --> 36:14.412
She was in on it from the start.

36:14.413 --> 36:16.213
Buckley didn't set her up in his office

36:16.313 --> 36:17.380
out of the goodness of his heart.

36:17.381 --> 36:20.116
He needed somebody working there
to man the call girl business.

36:20.117 --> 36:22.619
Not realizing that he was
giving Scarlett full access

36:22.620 --> 36:26.123
- to every facet of his organization.
- Knox didn't steal the client list.

36:26.124 --> 36:28.225
Scarlett gave it to him
so that the two of them

36:28.226 --> 36:29.394
could go into business together.

36:29.395 --> 36:31.495
And when Buckley wouldn't
walk away, Knox killed him,

36:31.595 --> 36:33.464
Never thinking we'd find out
about the call girl ring.

36:33.465 --> 36:34.665
And then when we did,
Scarlett realized

36:34.765 --> 36:36.867
that the only way to save
herself was by giving up Knox

36:36.868 --> 36:39.171
by playing the ultimate victim,
making you believe that Knox

36:39.172 --> 36:41.540
Beat her up so we'd think she
killed him out of self-defense.

36:41.541 --> 36:42.741
And I fell for it.

36:42.941 --> 36:44.209
- We all did.
- I didn't.

36:47.178 --> 36:49.080
Hi. How can I make you happy today?

36:50.081 --> 36:53.583
Yes, Candy is absolutely available.

36:53.584 --> 36:54.619
How would you like her to look?

36:56.920 --> 36:58.521
Girl next door sounds perfect.

36:58.722 --> 37:00.224
Can you confirm your client code?

37:02.325 --> 37:04.195
And your card information
is the same?

37:06.496 --> 37:08.832
Great.
Candy will see you at 7:00.

37:16.573 --> 37:18.942
Hi. How can I make you happy today?

37:18.943 --> 37:20.645
Yes, I'm looking for a girl.

37:21.946 --> 37:23.647
Well, you've certainly come
to the right place.

37:24.348 --> 37:25.549
Can you describe her?

37:25.850 --> 37:28.284
She came to New York
in an ancient blue Beetle,

37:28.285 --> 37:31.087
The floor so rusted, it
literally sagged in the middle.

37:31.988 --> 37:34.023
Castle. How did you get this number?

37:34.024 --> 37:35.827
I have a friend
in the publishing business.

37:37.728 --> 37:40.196
I'm sorry if I disappointed you.

37:40.197 --> 37:42.599
I-I just needed to take
a few more jobs

37:42.600 --> 37:43.534
to set myself up.

37:43.635 --> 37:45.802
You never stop manipulating,
do you, Scarlett?

37:46.403 --> 37:48.038
I should be impressed, really,

37:48.639 --> 37:49.706
How easily you played me,

37:49.707 --> 37:53.343
but all I can think about
is how sad it is...

37:55.444 --> 37:59.148
All that brains and beauty
wasted on a heart gone rotten.

37:59.149 --> 38:01.818
You're so busy building up walls
to keep people out,

38:01.819 --> 38:03.888
you don't even realize that
you're the one trapped inside...

38:04.989 --> 38:06.023
All alone.

38:11.061 --> 38:11.962
Will you stand up, please?

38:19.570 --> 38:20.971
You have the right
to remain silent.

38:21.172 --> 38:23.275
Anything you say can and will
be used against you...

38:25.476 --> 38:26.276
Thanks.

38:26.877 --> 38:27.744
For what?

38:27.945 --> 38:29.314
For not saying I told you so.

38:31.115 --> 38:32.783
Oh, that starts tomorrow.

Oh!
what was that for?

38:46.530 --> 38:48.064
For being the best Dad ever.

38:48.365 --> 38:50.767
It's true, you know. I have
the novelty mug to prove it.

38:50.768 --> 38:53.303
Mm. Thanks for trusting me,

38:54.004 --> 38:56.906
For not pushing when you knew
I was working something out.

38:57.107 --> 39:00.610
Well... I knew when you
were ready, you would tell me.

39:01.911 --> 39:02.946
So here it is...

39:02.947 --> 39:05.815
♪ ...Just next to me ♪

39:06.216 --> 39:08.451
My school is starting
a foreign exchange program

39:08.452 --> 39:09.653
to France.

39:09.854 --> 39:11.755
- France?
- Yeah.

39:11.756 --> 39:14.091
- You weren't kicked out of school?
- No.

39:15.328 --> 39:16.928
No, the program lasts three weeks,

39:17.028 --> 39:18.996
and so I'd miss your birthday.
And I knew that Beckett

39:18.997 --> 39:20.498
had spent a semester abroad
in college,

39:20.499 --> 39:22.867
and I wanted to ask her if
the experience was worth it.

39:23.668 --> 39:24.568
And what'd she say?

39:24.868 --> 39:27.470
She said that I'd be going off
to college in a couple of years,

39:27.471 --> 39:28.939
and that everything was gonna change,

39:28.940 --> 39:32.743
and maybe it'd be good if we got
a taste of that change now.

39:34.344 --> 39:35.345
Well...

39:36.346 --> 39:37.647
She's a smart woman.

39:37.948 --> 39:39.449
Yeah, she is.

39:40.350 --> 39:43.821
But I decided not to go anyway.

39:45.222 --> 39:47.023
Because two years
will be here soon enough,

39:47.124 --> 39:48.459
And I already got you your present,

39:48.460 --> 39:50.095
and I want to watch you open it.

39:51.096 --> 39:52.096
Mm.

39:52.796 --> 39:54.164
I say we celebrate with ice cream.

39:54.165 --> 39:56.000
- We'd be fools not to.
- Serve me.

39:57.336 --> 39:58.736
Chocolate or vanilla?

39:58.936 --> 40:00.036
Duh. Chocolate.

40:00.337 --> 40:02.639
Oh, and while we're eating,
we can talk about colleges.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.274
I picked up a couple of brochures

40:04.375 --> 40:05.075
at the guidance office,

40:05.076 --> 40:07.111
and you know what looks really cool?

40:07.112 --> 40:08.112
What?

40:08.212 --> 40:09.146
Oxford.

40:10.147 --> 40:11.014
Oxford?

40:12.215 --> 40:14.284
You know... you know
that's in England, right?

40:14.485 --> 40:15.252
Yeah.
