00:08.878 --> 00:11.707
- You better leave.
You better leave right now.

00:12.882 --> 00:14.405
- Ban right fright!

00:14.449 --> 00:16.494
- Mr. Bain, Edgar Whitman.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.105
- Nice to meet you,
Nathaniel Bain.

00:18.148 --> 00:19.932
- Welcome to Paul Revere
University.

00:19.976 --> 00:20.933
Right this way.

00:20.977 --> 00:22.196
- Go rot.

00:26.417 --> 00:31.074
- We overshot equality
by a mile in this country.

00:31.118 --> 00:35.992
Gender, race,
identity politics.

00:36.036 --> 00:40.431
We spend all our time ranting
and raving about safe zones

00:40.475 --> 00:46.655
and binary bathrooms
and, uh, comfort dogs,

00:46.698 --> 00:48.831
rather than the prosperity
and joy

00:48.874 --> 00:51.094
of the middle class.

00:55.577 --> 00:56.926
Come hell or high water,

00:56.969 --> 00:58.493
we're gonna get this country
back on track.

01:00.799 --> 01:04.368
We will not apologize

01:04.412 --> 01:09.765
for being
strong, white, and male.

01:12.072 --> 01:14.857
Ever.

01:14.900 --> 01:16.946
- You tell 'em that.
Yes!

01:18.426 --> 01:21.037
- You're a fascist pig,
you Nazi scum.

01:32.527 --> 01:34.398
- Heck of a speech.

01:34.442 --> 01:36.879
- You do what you have to do.
- Hmm.

01:36.922 --> 01:40.230
Do you really believe all that
hate you preach?

01:40.274 --> 01:42.232
Or you just love making
people crazy?

01:44.234 --> 01:46.149
- Both.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.499
- I appreciate the honesty.

01:56.028 --> 01:58.422
- Hmm.

02:00.207 --> 02:01.947
It's so good.

02:05.995 --> 02:07.562
Oh, my God!

02:09.651 --> 02:12.436
Somebody help me, please!

02:12.480 --> 02:14.134
The room is on fire!

02:16.745 --> 02:20.096
Somebody!

02:20.140 --> 02:21.967
Please!

02:24.622 --> 02:25.841
Please!

02:38.506 --> 02:40.725
- We've been here two seconds,
you're already working Tinder?

02:40.769 --> 02:42.423
- Working Tinder?
No, my sister goes here.

02:42.466 --> 02:43.641
I'm just trying to make sure
she's okay.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.817
- What?

02:45.861 --> 02:47.428
Hey, Ryan.
- Hey.

02:47.471 --> 02:49.734
We have a dozen injured with
smoke inhalation,

02:49.778 --> 02:52.737
one dead, guest speaker,
Nathaniel Bain.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.261
- Anybody hear or see anything?

02:54.304 --> 02:56.132
- Don't know,
still looking for witnesses.

02:56.176 --> 02:57.612
- We're gonna need
the security footage

02:57.655 --> 02:58.613
as soon as possible.

02:58.656 --> 03:00.005
- On it.

03:02.443 --> 03:05.446
- Yeah, right that way.
Possible break-in.

03:26.293 --> 03:27.598
- Hey.

03:29.687 --> 03:31.733
Looks like part of a bottle.

03:31.776 --> 03:36.564
- Delivery device?
Molotov maybe?

03:36.607 --> 03:38.087
- Hey, Tom?
- Yeah.

03:38.130 --> 03:39.958
- Can you rush this to the lab,
please?

03:40.002 --> 03:41.438
Thanks.

03:41.482 --> 03:42.700
- Found some security footage

03:42.744 --> 03:44.006
from outside the auditorium.

03:44.049 --> 03:45.442
Camera out back caught this

03:45.486 --> 03:47.836
four minutes before
the alarm sounded.

03:49.577 --> 03:53.276
- Male, skinny build.
He's holding his left hand.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.930
Maybe he hurt it in the attack.

03:54.973 --> 03:57.672
- Or burned it somehow.

03:57.715 --> 03:59.891
- Okay, we're gonna need
the names of everyone

03:59.935 --> 04:01.806
who had access to
the green room, fast.

04:01.850 --> 04:03.286
- Yeah.

04:06.855 --> 04:09.901
- Nathaniel Bain, outspoken,

04:09.945 --> 04:12.643
self-proclaimed western
chauvinist,

04:12.687 --> 04:15.255
and protector of
American values.

04:15.298 --> 04:16.908
So he's a people person.

04:16.952 --> 04:18.562
- He's pig.
- Hmm.

04:18.606 --> 04:20.347
- He rails against
political correctness

04:20.390 --> 04:23.654
and feminism while espousing
white nationalism

04:23.698 --> 04:26.657
and the preservation of
"European" civilization.

04:26.701 --> 04:29.007
- Can you pull up his enemies?
- Sure.

04:29.051 --> 04:32.750
Just need about a thousand more
screens.

04:32.794 --> 04:35.840
- We know he was banned from
several local radio stations

04:35.884 --> 04:39.627
and every tri-state campus,
except for Paul Revere U.

04:39.670 --> 04:42.064
- Because he's a hateful,
narrow-minded,

04:42.107 --> 04:44.762
sexist racist.

04:44.806 --> 04:46.938
- Focus on the evidence,
not on the politics.

04:46.982 --> 04:49.463
Our job is to protect
free speech, not to police it,

04:49.506 --> 04:52.727
and right now that's all
that matters.

04:52.770 --> 04:55.469
- Oh, results just came back
from the lab.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.949
They lifted prints off
the glass shard

04:57.993 --> 04:59.560
found in the green room.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.433
But no hits in the system.

05:03.477 --> 05:04.913
- No record, which means

05:04.956 --> 05:06.349
he's probably young
and inexperienced.

05:06.393 --> 05:07.698
- Or just really good.

05:07.742 --> 05:09.396
- No, no one really good
would do this.

05:09.439 --> 05:10.962
Too risky, too brazen.

05:11.006 --> 05:13.400
Political activists
are idealists,

05:13.443 --> 05:15.924
young, very influenced
by other people.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.752
So I bet we're looking at
a student.

05:17.795 --> 05:20.102
- Great, 'cause Paul Revere
only has about 10,000.

05:20.145 --> 05:23.018
- Well, better than 20.
- Hmm.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.151
- So right now,
let's track down

05:26.195 --> 05:27.457
the last person who saw
Nathaniel Bain alive.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.894
- Yeah.

05:29.938 --> 05:31.200
- I dropped him off at
the green room

05:31.243 --> 05:32.288
after the speech.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.724
That was it.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.378
We shook hands
and then I walked away.

05:35.422 --> 05:37.772
- We understand that there were
threats against Bain

05:37.815 --> 05:39.121
in advance of his speech.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.079
- Yes, 33 death threats.

05:41.123 --> 05:43.212
But our security team checked
it out,

05:43.255 --> 05:45.083
concluded they weren't
credible.

05:45.127 --> 05:46.824
I know he was a lightning rod,

05:46.868 --> 05:48.435
but that's why it was
so interesting.

05:48.478 --> 05:50.350
I was trying to make a point.

05:50.393 --> 05:52.743
I was trying to stand up for
the most liberal cause of all,

05:52.787 --> 05:55.529
freedom of speech.

05:55.572 --> 05:58.662
I loathed what came out of
Nathaniel Bain's mouth,

05:58.706 --> 06:00.882
but I respected his right
to say it.

06:00.925 --> 06:02.927
- Well, unfortunately
not everyone on your campus

06:02.971 --> 06:04.494
feels the same way.

06:04.538 --> 06:06.061
- Okay, we're gonna need
all the information

06:06.104 --> 06:07.671
regarding the various
death threats,

06:07.715 --> 06:09.456
and a list of all
the left-leaning

06:09.499 --> 06:10.892
political organizations.

06:10.935 --> 06:13.373
- Yes, the registrar
can provide you

06:13.416 --> 06:17.202
with a list of all the campus
political organizations.

06:17.246 --> 06:19.814
- Thank you.
We'll be in touch.

06:19.857 --> 06:21.250
- All right.

06:23.818 --> 06:26.690
- Everyone's so riled up
about everything.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.823
Every word, every opinion,
every label.

06:28.866 --> 06:30.607
- Well, it seems to be
getting worse too.

06:30.651 --> 06:32.957
It feels like
the tipping point.

06:33.001 --> 06:34.611
- Well, a man was just
assassinated,

06:34.655 --> 06:36.004
so I'd say we've already
tipped.

06:36.047 --> 06:37.571
- True.

06:37.614 --> 06:39.355
- What?

06:39.399 --> 06:40.574
- My sister.

06:40.617 --> 06:42.140
She is upset that I had
the audacity

06:42.184 --> 06:43.664
to see if she was okay.

06:43.707 --> 06:44.839
- Hey, you sure you don't
wanna track her down

06:44.882 --> 06:46.667
and say hi?

06:46.710 --> 06:48.973
Campus isn't even that big,
it's wouldn't be that hard.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.932
- You're right, it won't be.

06:50.975 --> 06:51.933
- Resist!
together: Hate.

06:51.976 --> 06:53.238
- There she is.

06:53.282 --> 06:54.501
together: Resist.
together: Hate.

07:04.032 --> 07:06.426
- Okay, please make this quick,
my friends are here.

07:06.469 --> 07:08.558
- It's really great to see you,
too.

07:09.559 --> 07:10.821
- I'm Maggie.

07:10.865 --> 07:12.475
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

07:12.519 --> 07:14.346
- Hope they pay you extra
for having to deal with him.

07:14.390 --> 07:15.565
- Wow.

07:17.001 --> 07:20.831
- Why are you here,
Nathaniel Bain?

07:20.875 --> 07:22.137
You know who killed him?

07:22.180 --> 07:23.965
- No, not yet.

07:24.008 --> 07:25.662
- You think it was a student?

07:25.706 --> 07:27.142
- It's possible.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.361
- Can't believe someone
actually murdered him.

07:29.405 --> 07:30.928
I get the impulse, trust me.

07:30.972 --> 07:33.365
He's, like, the grossest
human being ever.

07:33.409 --> 07:36.760
But still, I mean, to actually
kill someone, that's insane.

07:36.804 --> 07:40.242
- Yes, we agree.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.549
- Uh, nice to see you, Omar,

07:42.592 --> 07:44.159
but I have to get back
to my protest.

07:44.202 --> 07:46.901
- Sure, but what are you
protesting, exactly?

07:46.944 --> 07:49.077
Someone voicing their opinion?

07:49.120 --> 07:51.427
- Someone voicing hate.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.385
- Just because you don't
agree with it?

07:55.779 --> 07:58.869
- I'm always wrong,
no matter what.

08:01.655 --> 08:03.091
- What was that about?

08:03.134 --> 08:05.397
- I don't wanna talk about it.

08:07.878 --> 08:09.663
- So I tweeted something
insulting about

08:09.706 --> 08:11.665
a revolting human being.

08:11.708 --> 08:13.536
- The problem is,
that revolting human being

08:13.580 --> 08:15.451
is dead, cremated.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.409
It was an hour after
your tweet.

08:19.020 --> 08:22.414
Okay, that was meant to
be... metaphorical,

08:22.458 --> 08:24.112
not literal.

08:24.155 --> 08:26.723
Bain's disgusting,
I hate his politics,

08:26.767 --> 08:28.595
but I didn't kill the guy,
no way.

08:28.638 --> 08:32.816
Truth is, clowns like Bain
drive up donations.

08:32.860 --> 08:35.471
Everybody needs an enemy
to rally against.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.951
- So what about other members?

08:36.994 --> 08:38.866
Are any of them less
enlightened than you,

08:38.909 --> 08:40.737
maybe more prone to violence?

08:40.781 --> 08:44.567
- Some, but they all left,
and they wanted to radicalize.

08:44.611 --> 08:45.873
I refused.

08:45.916 --> 08:47.352
- Can you give us a list
of names

08:47.396 --> 08:48.789
of people who wanted to
radicalize?

08:48.832 --> 08:50.747
- No.

08:50.791 --> 08:52.967
- Let me try and ask that
in a different way.

08:53.010 --> 08:55.665
Give me list of these names
or we will have a warrant

08:55.709 --> 08:57.014
for every computer in this
room, every hard drive...

08:57.058 --> 08:58.973
- Okay.
- Every Google search...

08:59.016 --> 09:02.063
- Okay, I'll get you the names,

09:02.106 --> 09:05.936
but we're college students,
we're not killers.

09:13.204 --> 09:15.076
- These millenials are a joke.

09:15.119 --> 09:16.512
- You are a millenial.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.340
- No, I'm young,
there's a difference.

09:18.383 --> 09:19.689
And pretty sure being
in the FBI

09:19.733 --> 09:21.256
disqualifies you
from that label.

09:21.299 --> 09:22.562
- Huh, well then
you should go back there

09:22.605 --> 09:24.172
and tell them to get off
your lawn.

09:24.215 --> 09:26.087
- I should tell them to mow it.

09:26.130 --> 09:27.654
- Is that your problem with
your sister,

09:27.697 --> 09:28.872
she's a millenial?

09:28.916 --> 09:30.831
- I wish I could blame it
on that,

09:30.874 --> 09:32.484
it's more complicated.

09:32.528 --> 09:33.747
We just never got along,

09:33.790 --> 09:34.748
there was always a lot
of resentment.

09:34.791 --> 09:35.792
- Why?

09:37.664 --> 09:39.404
- Because I'm
an overbeating G-man

09:39.448 --> 09:42.103
who doesn't respect entitled,
opinionated teenagers.

09:54.855 --> 09:55.899
- He's heading down
a one-way street,

09:55.943 --> 09:57.335
we can cut him off this way.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.707
Careful, I don't see
the shooter.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.187
Don't move!

10:39.639 --> 10:41.902
- Are you crazy?
Huh?

10:41.945 --> 10:43.686
Shooting at the FBI,
trying to kill us.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.383
- No, we weren't shooting
at you.

10:45.427 --> 10:46.428
- Who were you shooting at?

10:46.471 --> 10:48.256
- The building, the club.

10:48.299 --> 10:49.910
- Yeah, well, 30 rounds
of 9 millimeters say otherwise.

10:49.953 --> 10:52.260
- I was just shooting at
the building, I swear.

10:52.303 --> 10:53.957
- Why, you don't like brick?

10:54.001 --> 10:55.959
- No, I don't like the SDSU.

10:56.003 --> 10:57.134
- Why's that?

10:57.178 --> 10:58.309
- 'Cause they're elitist punks.

10:58.353 --> 10:59.789
- So you do a drive-by?

11:01.965 --> 11:03.967
- Just trying to scare 'em.
- Why?

11:04.011 --> 11:06.143
- Because of what they did
to Nathaniel Bain.

11:06.187 --> 11:08.058
- What, you think SDSU
had something to do

11:08.102 --> 11:09.277
with the murder?

11:09.320 --> 11:10.931
- Don't know for sure,

11:10.974 --> 11:12.976
but they torched our clubhouse
last week.

11:13.020 --> 11:14.848
So, they might have torched
Bain too.

11:14.891 --> 11:17.981
- I'm sorry, what?
Someone torched your clubhouse?

11:18.025 --> 11:20.767
- Yeah, no one got hurt, but--

11:20.810 --> 11:22.812
- Did you call the police?

11:22.856 --> 11:24.509
- No, just the fire department.

11:24.553 --> 11:26.294
- What, you didn't want
law enforcement involved?

11:29.079 --> 11:31.168
So you can get revenge?

11:36.913 --> 11:39.002
- Where's your clubhouse?

11:46.618 --> 11:50.057
- Well, fire department
put out the fire,

11:50.100 --> 11:51.754
didn't process the scene.

11:51.798 --> 11:55.540
- Another Molotov cocktail,
same M.O. as Bain's murder.

11:55.584 --> 11:57.020
- Used to be a time
where you could disagree

11:57.064 --> 11:58.848
with someone and not get
firebombed.

11:58.892 --> 12:01.503
- Yeah, well, I think
that ship has sailed.

12:04.071 --> 12:06.464
- Let's check the glass
for prints.

12:06.508 --> 12:08.249
- Thank you.

12:08.292 --> 12:10.860
So, the lab compared the prints
on the glass

12:10.904 --> 12:12.688
found at the Savage Sons'
clubhouse

12:12.732 --> 12:14.777
to those on the glass
at Bain's murder.

12:14.821 --> 12:16.605
They belong to the same person.

12:16.648 --> 12:19.347
- So the suspect moved
from arson to arson plus murder

12:19.390 --> 12:20.478
in two weeks.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.785
He's escalating.

12:22.829 --> 12:24.439
What about social media
threats?

12:24.482 --> 12:26.484
Anything before the clubhouse
fire?

12:26.528 --> 12:29.661
- No, but I did dig out
an obscure post afterwards

12:29.705 --> 12:31.751
with a nominal claim
of responsibility

12:31.794 --> 12:35.058
from someone named
"Vanguard2018."

12:35.102 --> 12:37.060
"A new dawn is rising."

12:37.104 --> 12:38.496
Could be political,

12:38.540 --> 12:40.020
someone taking credit
for the fire.

12:40.063 --> 12:41.586
- Is "New Dawn" a name

12:41.630 --> 12:43.240
or is Mr. Vanguard just
being poetic?

12:43.284 --> 12:45.939
- Well, we ran "New Dawn,"
it came up empty,

12:45.982 --> 12:47.810
but we are still tracking
the hashtag.

12:47.854 --> 12:50.291
- All right, well, for now
we consider it a shadow group.

12:50.334 --> 12:52.119
- Which means it won't stay
in the dark for long.

12:52.162 --> 12:54.077
- Any chance they're connected
to the University?

12:54.121 --> 12:55.252
- Possible.

12:55.296 --> 12:56.514
- Giving the assailant's
profile,

12:56.558 --> 12:57.907
the location of the attacks,

12:57.951 --> 12:59.300
I would say more likely
probable.

12:59.343 --> 13:01.171
- I'd say definite.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.826
Just found a few social media
posts referencing New Dawn.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.176
It was posted by someone
named Claire Taylor.

13:06.220 --> 13:09.049
Check out the tags,
#NewDawnRising,

13:09.092 --> 13:11.965
#RevTheory, #PRU.

13:12.008 --> 13:14.489
- Find out who teaches
Revolution Theory

13:14.532 --> 13:15.838
at Paul Revere.

13:15.882 --> 13:19.581
- New Dawn?
No, never heard of them.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.365
Why?
What's this about?

13:21.409 --> 13:23.411
- We're investigating
the murder of Nathaniel Bain,

13:23.454 --> 13:25.195
and we came across that name,
New Dawn.

13:25.239 --> 13:27.807
We believe it's a campus-based
political organization.

13:27.850 --> 13:30.113
- And since you seem to be
the professor of choice

13:30.157 --> 13:32.202
for lots of politically-active
students...

13:33.508 --> 13:35.989
I take that as a compliment,
but, uh,

13:36.032 --> 13:37.642
I never heard of this group,
sorry.

13:37.686 --> 13:39.166
- Hmm.
- And for the record,

13:39.209 --> 13:40.907
I teach
Brazilian Literature too.

13:40.950 --> 13:42.386
- We ran the names of
31 students

13:42.430 --> 13:44.519
who posted threats
against Bain

13:44.562 --> 13:48.697
and 30 of them take your
Revolutionary Theory class.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.699
- I'm not sure what that means.

13:50.742 --> 13:54.311
- It means we think one of
your students may be involved.

13:54.355 --> 13:55.791
- In the murder?

13:58.272 --> 14:00.317
Really?

14:00.361 --> 14:03.364
- Can you tell us about
Claire Taylor?

14:03.407 --> 14:05.366
- She's one of your students.

14:05.409 --> 14:07.629
She was arrested three weeks
ago for protesting

14:07.672 --> 14:10.284
the expansion of PRU into
an inner-city neighborhood.

14:10.327 --> 14:11.851
You bailed her out.

14:11.894 --> 14:13.853
- She called for help,
so I helped her.

14:13.896 --> 14:15.289
- Where is she now?

14:15.332 --> 14:17.334
- London.

14:17.378 --> 14:20.903
She moved there with her family
three weeks ago.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.600
- Professor Kelly wasn't lying,

14:22.644 --> 14:25.168
Claire Taylor has been in
London for the past 23 days.

14:25.212 --> 14:27.083
- Okay, so we know she didn't
kill Bain.

14:27.127 --> 14:28.302
What else do we know about her?

14:28.345 --> 14:29.390
- Born in New York,

14:29.433 --> 14:31.261
graduated from Trinity Prep,

14:31.305 --> 14:34.656
enrolled at PRU two years ago,
Poli-Sci major.

14:34.699 --> 14:36.614
She lived in an off-campus
apartment

14:36.658 --> 14:38.616
on 175th and Broadway.

14:38.660 --> 14:41.054
Was an editor of
the "Daily Pru."

14:41.097 --> 14:42.446
- The "Daily Pru"?
- Yes.

14:42.490 --> 14:43.926
- Good, that's helpful,
Kristen.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.058
Thank you.

14:45.101 --> 14:46.537
- Why's the "Daily Pru"
helpful?

14:46.581 --> 14:48.148
- Because my sister works
there too.

14:50.977 --> 14:52.369
- Yeah, I know her.

14:52.413 --> 14:54.981
We both worked at
the "Daily Pru," or used to.

14:55.024 --> 14:56.765
She left school.
Why?

14:56.808 --> 14:58.114
- We think that she might be
involved

14:58.158 --> 15:01.291
in a political organization,
New Dawn.

15:01.335 --> 15:04.033
- You think New Dawn
is involved?

15:04.077 --> 15:05.513
- You've heard of them?

15:05.556 --> 15:07.907
- Yeah, Claire mentioned
the name a few times,

15:07.950 --> 15:09.865
but they can't be
that dangerous.

15:09.909 --> 15:10.997
Claire was pretty mellow.

15:11.040 --> 15:12.737
I mean, hardcore
social warrior?

15:12.781 --> 15:14.522
Yeah, but hardly a badass.

15:14.565 --> 15:16.393
I mean, she summers
in Nantucket.

15:16.437 --> 15:19.309
- Well, right now we think that
New Dawn might be involved

15:19.353 --> 15:21.094
in the murder of
Nathaniel Bain.

15:23.966 --> 15:26.969
- Okay, other than Claire,
do you know of anyone else

15:27.013 --> 15:28.536
who's involved in
the organization?

15:28.579 --> 15:31.365
- Um...yeah.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.454
I met this girl named Heather
once through Claire.

15:33.497 --> 15:36.065
She said she was part of
a new radical group.

15:36.109 --> 15:37.327
She was all excited about it,

15:37.371 --> 15:38.676
said it was gonna change
the world

15:38.720 --> 15:40.635
or something like that.

15:40.678 --> 15:41.984
- Do you know Heather's
last name?

15:42.028 --> 15:43.768
- No,

15:43.812 --> 15:45.857
but I bet I could
track her down.

15:45.901 --> 15:47.120
- No, I don't want you
getting involved.

15:47.163 --> 15:48.251
- Why?

15:48.295 --> 15:49.992
If you're right about this,

15:50.036 --> 15:51.907
that New Dawn is involved
in the murder,

15:51.951 --> 15:53.778
it would make an awesome story.

15:55.258 --> 15:56.738
I'm a journalist, remember?

15:56.781 --> 15:58.044
- Uh, I said no, Amira.

15:58.087 --> 15:59.219
- You don't trust me?

15:59.262 --> 16:00.568
You don't think
I can handle it?

16:00.611 --> 16:01.743
- That's not what
this is about.

16:01.786 --> 16:03.484
- This is great story, Omar,

16:03.527 --> 16:06.356
and I'm going to chase it
with or without your approval.

16:12.362 --> 16:13.798
- Okay.

16:13.842 --> 16:15.452
- Okay, what?

16:15.496 --> 16:17.585
- Okay, you can track her down.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.369
- And then?
- Then nothing.

16:19.413 --> 16:21.415
You give me her last name,
we'll take it from there.

16:21.458 --> 16:25.114
- Or I introduce her to Maggie
and help you guys get under.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.769
I'll be fine, I promise.

16:36.430 --> 16:37.735
- Track her down,

16:37.779 --> 16:41.043
make the introduction,
that's it.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.349
- Okay.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.007
- All right, here's my cover.

16:48.050 --> 16:51.053
I'm a family friend with
an activist past.

16:51.097 --> 16:53.055
- Make sure you memorize
every detail.

16:53.099 --> 16:54.578
- I will, don't worry.

16:54.622 --> 16:57.712
- Amira, this is not a joke.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.105
You understand me?

17:01.281 --> 17:02.760
- She's gonna be great.

17:02.804 --> 17:04.327
And this doesn't have to
take a lot of time,

17:04.371 --> 17:07.374
I just need you to introduce me
to Heather.

17:07.417 --> 17:09.724
After that, I'll take it
from there, right?

17:09.767 --> 17:11.030
I might meet a few members

17:11.073 --> 17:12.422
and find a place
to plant the wire,

17:12.466 --> 17:14.990
but then I'm gonna
get the hell out.

17:15.034 --> 17:17.253
- Just wanna make sure
you're gonna be okay.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.561
- We're gonna be fine.

17:25.435 --> 17:26.828
- Good luck.

17:26.871 --> 17:28.047
- I don't know
how you deal with him.

17:28.090 --> 17:29.178
- He's not that bad.

17:29.222 --> 17:31.137
- Maybe with you, but with me

17:31.180 --> 17:33.139
if I zig, he thinks I should
have zagged.

17:33.182 --> 17:34.575
Know what I mean?

17:34.618 --> 17:35.880
- Yeah, I have
an older brother too.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.882
- I wish he was
my older brother.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.710
- Ten years ago our dad died
and ever since

17:39.754 --> 17:41.756
he acts more like a father.

17:43.323 --> 17:44.933
- He is right about that.

17:44.976 --> 17:48.415
You really do need to memorize
everything in there.

17:48.458 --> 17:50.460
- I will.

17:50.504 --> 17:51.940
- Don't be nervous,

17:51.983 --> 17:53.507
I'm gonna be with you
the whole time.

17:53.550 --> 17:56.423
- Good.
I'm actually kind of excited.

18:17.226 --> 18:18.619
- That's her.

18:24.799 --> 18:27.106
Heather?

18:27.149 --> 18:29.586
Hi, I'm Amira, Claire's friend.

18:29.630 --> 18:32.850
We met a while back.
- Yeah, I remember.

18:32.894 --> 18:35.244
- This is my friend, Maggie.

18:35.288 --> 18:37.246
We grew up in the same
neighborhood.

18:39.248 --> 18:40.597
- So, what's up?

18:40.641 --> 18:42.469
Why'd you call?

18:42.512 --> 18:44.949
- Claire said if I ever ran
into trouble, you could help.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.821
- What's troubling you?

18:49.867 --> 18:51.304
- The Right Stuff,

18:51.347 --> 18:52.435
they're this white nationalist
group--

18:52.479 --> 18:53.915
- I know who they are.

18:55.351 --> 18:58.441
- These punks bet up my friends
after Bain got killed,

18:58.485 --> 19:00.791
'cause one of them had on
a Bernie t-shirt.

19:00.835 --> 19:03.533
One kid is still in
the hospital.

19:03.577 --> 19:04.752
- I'm sorry to hear that,

19:04.795 --> 19:06.754
but what's that gotta do
with me?

19:06.797 --> 19:08.625
- I don't like being attacked
for my beliefs,

19:08.669 --> 19:11.237
and I don't want it happening
again.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.543
- Long road between
dislike and deed.

19:13.587 --> 19:16.894
- Well, that's where I come in.

19:16.938 --> 19:18.374
- What do you mean?

19:18.418 --> 19:21.638
- I mean I wanna be involved
with deeds.

19:23.466 --> 19:27.557
Amira told me about Claire
and New Dawn.

19:27.601 --> 19:30.256
I'm the one that asked
for the introduction.

19:34.390 --> 19:36.871
- We're not accepting
applications at the moment.

19:36.914 --> 19:40.266
- Hmm, yeah.
All bark, no bite.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.833
Like all the other candy-ass
liberals.

19:42.877 --> 19:44.270
- Excuse me?

19:47.360 --> 19:48.926
- I've shed real blood
for this cause,

19:48.970 --> 19:50.363
you understand me?

19:50.406 --> 19:51.886
So I don't appreciate
the attitude

19:51.929 --> 19:54.062
or the disrespect.

20:00.068 --> 20:01.939
- So who'd you move with?

20:01.983 --> 20:03.506
Where'd you shed the blood?

20:03.550 --> 20:05.987
- Charlottesville.

20:06.030 --> 20:07.815
- I was there too.

20:11.601 --> 20:13.212
Let me buy you drink.

20:15.475 --> 20:17.259
- All right.

20:17.303 --> 20:20.131
- Okay, Amira, you made
the introduction, time to go.

20:22.612 --> 20:25.267
- We swore we wouldn't budge.
Thanks.

20:25.311 --> 20:28.966
Uh, cops had batons, shields,
like, all their armor.

20:29.010 --> 20:30.272
- Did you hold the line?

20:30.316 --> 20:33.057
- Yeah, I mean,
until the tear gas.

20:33.101 --> 20:35.886
You go blind, it's like
breathing fire.

20:35.930 --> 20:37.584
- Right on.

20:41.936 --> 20:44.112
- Uh, is there a bathroom?

20:44.155 --> 20:45.635
- Past the stage.

20:53.991 --> 20:56.255
- Excuse me.

20:56.298 --> 20:57.647
- What's your problem?

21:04.698 --> 21:06.308
- I'm heading into
the back room.

21:15.143 --> 21:16.797
They got guns back here, OA.

21:16.840 --> 21:19.016
A lot of them.

21:20.757 --> 21:22.150
- Hey.

21:22.193 --> 21:24.413
Who are you?

21:31.507 --> 21:32.726
- I'm a friend of Heather's.

21:32.769 --> 21:34.641
- What the hell you doing
in here?

21:34.684 --> 21:36.947
- Actually, I was looking
for the bathroom.

21:40.777 --> 21:43.171
- Hey, this isn't a bathroom.

21:43.214 --> 21:45.042
- You know her?

21:45.086 --> 21:48.524
- We just met.

21:48.568 --> 21:50.178
- Who's she?

21:50.221 --> 21:53.224
- Friend of Claire's,
came here with Maggie.

21:53.268 --> 21:56.184
They're talking about
joining our movement.

21:56.227 --> 21:57.794
- You two willing to get
your hands dirty?

21:57.838 --> 21:59.970
- Wouldn't be here
if we weren't.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.892
- We were gonna take a ride.
Why don't you come with us?

22:08.936 --> 22:11.678
- Uh, yeah, great.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.070
She's gonna stay back,

22:13.114 --> 22:14.898
had a pretty rough
couple of days.

22:17.118 --> 22:20.077
- Nah, this will be
therapeutic, I promise.

22:20.121 --> 22:22.036
- I get it, but--
- You're both coming.

22:29.086 --> 22:30.174
- It's okay.

22:32.655 --> 22:34.396
- I don't like this,
they're in too deep.

22:34.440 --> 22:36.267
- You wanna pull them out?

22:49.672 --> 22:52.806
- No, let's play this out
for now.

23:04.818 --> 23:06.167
- You ever hear of Alt-Knights?

23:06.210 --> 23:09.388
- Yeah, like Savage Sons,
but dumber.

23:10.693 --> 23:12.695
- Get ready to introduce
yourself.

23:25.491 --> 23:26.927
- Is that tap code?

23:31.714 --> 23:34.456
- 10-34, shooting in progress.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.515
- Get ready, we're coming up.

23:49.558 --> 23:52.126
The one with the American flag
in front.

23:52.169 --> 23:53.867
- Are you ready for this?

23:59.263 --> 24:01.831
- There it is.

24:08.838 --> 24:10.884
- This is bad, man.

24:10.927 --> 24:12.233
- Give me that.

24:14.931 --> 24:16.498
Nah, we're good.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.848
- We got five felonies
sitting in here, man.

24:18.892 --> 24:21.547
That's real time,
that ain't nothing good.

24:21.590 --> 24:23.113
- You know what?
I'll handle this.

24:23.157 --> 24:24.941
- Just shut up and stay put.
- Kiss my ass.

24:29.119 --> 24:30.556
- Ma'am get back in your car.
- Hey!

24:30.599 --> 24:32.079
Ma'am get back in your car.

24:32.122 --> 24:33.646
- No, what's going on
right now?

24:33.689 --> 24:34.647
Why are you pulling us over?
- Stop walking.

24:34.690 --> 24:36.170
- Huh?

24:36.213 --> 24:37.824
You just wanna harass
innocent citizens?

24:37.867 --> 24:40.174
- Ma'am we're not
gonna warn you again.

24:40.217 --> 24:42.002
- Is Amira okay?
- Yeah.

24:42.045 --> 24:43.830
Look, there are AK-47s
in the car,

24:43.873 --> 24:45.048
so you need to give me
a minute.

24:45.092 --> 24:47.529
Stay on our six.

24:47.573 --> 24:49.009
I'm recording this.
- Okay.

24:49.052 --> 24:50.967
- These police officers
are harassing me,

24:51.011 --> 24:53.013
verbally abusing me
and I've done nothing wrong.

24:53.056 --> 24:54.797
- Okay, all right. Enough.

24:54.841 --> 24:56.495
- I'm an innocent citizen,
a hard working citizen.

24:56.538 --> 24:57.539
Why don't you give me
your badge number?

24:57.583 --> 24:59.149
- Okay, okay.

24:59.193 --> 25:00.716
- Put that away, you're getting
off easy tonight.

25:02.370 --> 25:04.285
- Hey, be careful.

25:16.776 --> 25:18.386
- All right, we're good,
let's go.

25:22.912 --> 25:25.349
- I mean, that was insane.

25:25.393 --> 25:27.351
- Best offense is
a good defense.

25:27.395 --> 25:28.701
- It's a gutsy call.

25:28.744 --> 25:30.964
- Not really.

25:31.007 --> 25:33.836
Isn't that what New Dawn's
all about?

25:33.880 --> 25:35.534
- That's exactly what
we're all about.

25:38.101 --> 25:39.625
To a crazy night.

25:39.668 --> 25:42.323
- To many more.
- And not getting arrested.

25:46.196 --> 25:47.284
I'll top us off.

26:00.994 --> 26:03.344
Amira, who's the guy
at the bar?

26:03.387 --> 26:05.128
Black jacket.

26:06.739 --> 26:08.044
- I don't know.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.398
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

26:14.442 --> 26:16.096
- Two whiskeys for the people
at the bar.

26:16.139 --> 26:18.620
- No problem.
- Thank you.

26:39.075 --> 26:41.338
Meet me at the door
in ten seconds.

26:48.128 --> 26:49.608
- The prints from
the shot glass

26:49.651 --> 26:52.393
match the two from
the Molotov cocktails.

26:52.436 --> 26:54.482
Now let's see
who they belong to.

27:04.187 --> 27:05.536
- Connor Whitman.

27:05.580 --> 27:08.148
- Let's see what else
we can find.

27:10.541 --> 27:12.500
- President Whitman's son.

27:24.033 --> 27:25.644
- So we have
Connor Whitman's prints

27:25.687 --> 27:27.428
at the scene of the Savage Sons
clubhouse fire

27:27.471 --> 27:28.559
and Nathaniel Bain murder.

27:28.603 --> 27:29.952
- Any criminal record?

27:29.996 --> 27:31.780
- One misdemeanor
for resisting arrest

27:31.824 --> 27:34.000
in 2017 at the Women's March.

27:34.043 --> 27:36.306
- Hmm, he's really stepped up
his game since then.

27:36.350 --> 27:37.699
- Let's bring him in,

27:37.743 --> 27:39.179
see what he has to say
for himself.

27:39.222 --> 27:41.224
- We already hit his apartment,
he wasn't there.

27:43.487 --> 27:45.359
- Talk to the father,

27:45.402 --> 27:47.013
tell him just enough to scare
him into making a phone call.

27:48.884 --> 27:51.757
- OA, Amira's waiting in
the conference room for you.

27:51.800 --> 27:54.629
- She okay?
- I think so.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.718
She's tougher than she looks.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.589
- Yeah, she's more stubborn
too.

28:03.943 --> 28:06.032
Sure you're okay?
- I'm fine.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.732
- I think that if I stay
under with Heather...

28:10.776 --> 28:14.127
- Stay under with Heather?
No, you're done.

28:14.170 --> 28:18.566
You made the introduction,
you were great.

28:18.609 --> 28:19.785
Now it's time to go back

28:19.828 --> 28:21.612
and be a normal
college student.

28:21.656 --> 28:24.398
- I'm a journalist on the verge
of cracking a major case.

28:24.441 --> 28:27.793
- They killed Nathaniel Bain.

28:27.836 --> 28:29.577
They burned him alive.

28:29.620 --> 28:30.752
- That's why it's
a great story.

28:30.796 --> 28:31.927
- No--

28:33.886 --> 28:36.845
No, it's a terrible story,

28:36.889 --> 28:39.021
a dangerous story.

28:39.065 --> 28:42.590
You are done with New Dawn,
you are done with Heather.

28:42.633 --> 28:43.896
Do you understand me?

28:52.731 --> 28:54.776
- You know, you're not Dad.

29:04.046 --> 29:06.353
- My secretary said
it was urgent, what's going on?

29:06.396 --> 29:08.485
- Uh,

29:08.529 --> 29:10.705
we found your son's name
on a hit list

29:10.749 --> 29:12.533
of the alt-right group,
the Savage Sons,

29:12.576 --> 29:14.840
and we think his life
may be in danger.

29:14.883 --> 29:16.537
- What are you talking about?

29:16.580 --> 29:17.973
- Word is they think he had
something to do with

29:18.017 --> 29:19.322
the assassination of
Nathaniel Bain,

29:19.366 --> 29:21.411
and they're seeking
retribution.

29:21.455 --> 29:22.761
- Well, that's absurd.

29:22.804 --> 29:24.675
Connor's never even
been in a fight.

29:24.719 --> 29:27.026
He's not a hitman,
this must be some mistake.

29:27.069 --> 29:28.810
- I'm just reporting
the facts, sir.

29:28.854 --> 29:30.464
- I appreciate that, but--
- Do you know where he is?

29:32.553 --> 29:34.033
I need to speak with him
as soon as possible

29:34.076 --> 29:35.774
for his own protection.

29:39.342 --> 29:41.562
- Well, you're gonna speak
to my lawyer instead.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.172
We're done here.

29:47.611 --> 29:48.874
- Kristen, we up?

29:48.917 --> 29:51.441
- Call coming through now.

29:51.485 --> 29:53.095
- Dad, I can't talk right now.

29:53.139 --> 29:56.446
- No, you're gonna talk,
so you shut up and listen.

29:56.490 --> 29:58.361
And I'm gonna ask you this
just once.

29:58.405 --> 30:00.363
Do you anything about
the murder of Nathaniel Bain?

30:00.407 --> 30:01.800
- Why would you ask me that?

30:01.843 --> 30:03.323
- Because you live
in a dream world.

30:03.366 --> 30:05.194
- Wait, did someone
say something?

30:05.238 --> 30:07.066
- Yes, the FBI was just here.

30:07.109 --> 30:10.069
The FBI and they were asking
questions about you.

30:12.375 --> 30:15.770
- I'm sorry, Dad.

30:15.814 --> 30:17.946
I was--I was just trying
to scare him.

30:17.990 --> 30:20.427
- Wait--wait, you had something
to do with this?

30:20.470 --> 30:21.428
Are you serious?

30:21.471 --> 30:23.212
Who put you up to this?

30:23.256 --> 30:24.953
- I'm sorry, Dad,
I have to go.

30:24.997 --> 30:26.825
- No, no, you stay
where you are,

30:26.868 --> 30:28.435
and if anybody comes to talk
to you,

30:28.478 --> 30:30.132
the police or the FBI,
you get a lawyer, okay?

30:30.176 --> 30:32.091
- I love you, Dad.
- Yeah, I--

30:34.223 --> 30:35.616
- Something's wrong.

30:35.659 --> 30:37.400
- This kid is spiraling.

30:37.444 --> 30:38.924
- I've got a location,

30:38.967 --> 30:40.882
corner of 145th and Amsterdam.

30:40.926 --> 30:41.927
- Go, go, go.

30:55.505 --> 30:56.637
- OA.

31:06.386 --> 31:09.389
Okay.

31:11.347 --> 31:15.264
- Roll an ambo to
338 145th Street right away.

31:17.658 --> 31:18.702
Come on.

31:20.182 --> 31:21.531
Come on.

31:33.761 --> 31:35.937
- Hey, Connor.

31:35.981 --> 31:38.026
We need to talk to you
about Nathaniel Bain.

31:38.070 --> 31:40.028
We know you threw
the Molotov cocktail

31:40.072 --> 31:41.595
in the green room.

31:41.638 --> 31:43.945
- We have your prints
on the bottle

31:43.989 --> 31:47.253
and on the bottle used to torch
the Savage Sons' clubhouse.

31:47.296 --> 31:49.559
So the second you get
discharged from here,

31:49.603 --> 31:52.562
you will be put under arrest
for murder.

31:52.606 --> 31:54.129
- Unless you cooperate.

31:54.173 --> 31:56.740
You tell us who's calling
the shots.

31:56.784 --> 31:59.439
If you do that,
we can work something out.

32:02.746 --> 32:04.574
Connor, we've recovered
your phone,

32:04.618 --> 32:07.403
and we've read
all of your texts.

32:07.447 --> 32:10.102
We know what your fearless
leader's been saying to you,

32:10.145 --> 32:12.452
how they've been
persuading you.

32:19.502 --> 32:21.940
- He wasn't persuading me.

32:25.204 --> 32:26.945
He was reminding me
of our credo.

32:26.988 --> 32:28.990
- And what's that?

32:31.210 --> 32:33.342
- "There's no more noble death
than that of

32:33.386 --> 32:35.649
a soldier dying for a cause."

32:37.042 --> 32:40.436
- Connor, suicide is not noble.

32:41.916 --> 32:44.440
And you're not a soldier.

32:47.617 --> 32:50.969
- Who told you to attack
Nathaniel Bain?

32:51.012 --> 32:53.275
You're 21 years old,

32:53.319 --> 32:55.886
you could still have a great
life ahead of you.

33:04.112 --> 33:06.941
- Okay.

33:06.985 --> 33:11.511
Okay, but, uh, but you can't
tell him I told you.

33:11.554 --> 33:14.079
- We won't.
Was it a friend?

33:19.084 --> 33:21.869
- It was, uh...

33:21.912 --> 33:23.914
It was a professor.

33:23.958 --> 33:26.221
It was a professor
at the college.

33:28.049 --> 33:31.487
- Is this your professor,
Will Kelly?

33:31.531 --> 33:33.359
Did he tell you to throw
the Molotov cocktail

33:33.402 --> 33:34.838
at Nathaniel Bain?

33:42.498 --> 33:43.891
- FBI!

33:43.934 --> 33:45.675
Charlie Team,
clear lower level.

33:45.719 --> 33:48.461
Up the stairs.
Top door, right.

33:48.504 --> 33:50.767
- Clear.
- Clear.

33:50.811 --> 33:53.074
- We're all clear, left.

33:53.118 --> 33:55.946
- Charlie Team, status report.

33:57.731 --> 33:58.775
- Hey.

34:00.777 --> 34:02.953
No professor, but we found
a ton of these in the garage.

34:14.313 --> 34:17.098
- Styrofoam and gasoline.

34:17.142 --> 34:19.622
Okay, he's making
a napalm bomb.

34:28.370 --> 34:30.807
- So BOLO's out,
air assets are airborne,

34:30.851 --> 34:32.896
NYPD, and New York
State Police,

34:32.940 --> 34:34.594
every cop and agent in
the street's in the loop,

34:34.637 --> 34:36.465
they're all looking for
Professor Will's car.

34:36.509 --> 34:38.163
- Any history on the vehicle?

34:38.206 --> 34:39.990
- He bought it used
two years ago.

34:40.034 --> 34:42.167
The previous owners included
a rental company.

34:42.210 --> 34:44.517
- Which means there's probably
a tracking system on board.

34:44.560 --> 34:46.388
- Which we can't access
without a warrant.

34:46.432 --> 34:47.694
- Hang on.

34:49.870 --> 34:51.567
Hey, this is SAC
Dana Mosier,

34:51.611 --> 34:54.222
I need to speak to AUSA Posner
right away, please.

34:56.616 --> 34:58.313
Henry, hey, it's Dana.

34:58.357 --> 35:00.446
Look, I need a verbal
authorization to activate

35:00.489 --> 35:03.449
a tracking device on
a William Kelly's vehicle.

35:03.492 --> 35:05.842
- Plate reader just got a hit
on the Queensboro Bridge,

35:05.886 --> 35:07.714
eastbound ten minutes ago.

35:07.757 --> 35:10.282
- He's heading into Queens.
- Or Brooklyn or Long Island.

35:10.325 --> 35:11.848
Further he gets,
the harder he is to find.

35:11.892 --> 35:14.329
- Yeah.
- Ah, you're the best.

35:14.373 --> 35:15.765
Thank you, Henry.

35:15.809 --> 35:18.507
Written documents
are coming now.

35:18.551 --> 35:20.030
Okay, affidavit's coming.

35:20.074 --> 35:21.728
- Lily, can you patch us
into their system?

35:21.771 --> 35:22.990
- You got it.

35:27.212 --> 35:28.517
- He's at the waterfront.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.780
- Maggie, circle the wagons.

35:30.824 --> 35:32.869
- Copy that.
We're approaching now.

35:47.101 --> 35:48.407
- It's still warm,
couldn't have gotten far,

35:48.450 --> 35:49.843
five, maybe six blocks.

35:49.886 --> 35:51.671
- All right,
this is our suspect.

35:51.714 --> 35:52.715
- Okay.
- NYPD.

35:52.759 --> 35:54.021
- Yes, ma'am.

35:54.064 --> 35:55.370
- We need a cordon
of eight blocks.

35:55.414 --> 35:56.937
- Affirmative.
- No one in or out.

35:56.980 --> 35:57.981
Agents, canvass on foot,
let's go.

36:02.986 --> 36:04.031
- OA.

36:15.434 --> 36:16.391
- Don't move.

36:16.435 --> 36:17.697
- Oh.

36:19.525 --> 36:21.048
- Hey, FBI.

36:21.091 --> 36:24.269
Put your hands up,
get against the wall now.

36:24.312 --> 36:26.184
- You're under arrest.
- For what?

36:26.227 --> 36:27.837
- For domestic terrorism,
murder,

36:27.881 --> 36:29.230
conspiracy to commit murder,

36:29.274 --> 36:30.753
but I'm sure the U.S.
Attorney's Office

36:30.797 --> 36:32.233
can think of plenty more
charges too.

36:37.586 --> 36:39.762
We found Styrofoam plates
and gasoline

36:39.806 --> 36:41.590
in your apartment.

36:41.634 --> 36:43.375
- There's no law against owning
Styrofoam and gasoline.

36:43.418 --> 36:45.420
- No, there's not, but there
is one against making

36:45.464 --> 36:47.292
and detonating napalm bombs.

36:47.335 --> 36:49.598
- What the hell
are you talking about?

36:49.642 --> 36:51.470
- You killed Nathaniel Bain.

36:51.513 --> 36:52.949
- I killed no one,

36:52.993 --> 36:54.734
my follower did,
Connor Whitman.

36:54.777 --> 36:56.388
He's actions have nothing
to do with me.

36:56.431 --> 36:58.781
- Sure they do,
it's called conspiracy.

36:58.825 --> 37:01.088
- These young men and women
idolize me.

37:01.131 --> 37:03.482
No, you know what?
They, uh, they revere me.

37:03.525 --> 37:06.354
They live to fulfill my vision
and dreams,

37:06.398 --> 37:09.575
but what they do and how
they do it, that's on them.

37:09.618 --> 37:11.141
- Hmm.

37:11.185 --> 37:13.056
Sound familiar to you?

37:16.234 --> 37:18.018
You're like Osama bin Laden,

37:18.061 --> 37:22.152
and Connor Whitman
and all the other New Dawners,

37:22.196 --> 37:23.676
they're like your jihadists?

37:23.719 --> 37:24.807
- Is that what you're saying?

37:24.851 --> 37:27.549
- Your words, not mine.

37:29.029 --> 37:30.204
- OA.

37:34.687 --> 37:36.341
You need to see his phone.

37:36.384 --> 37:38.473
We've been going through it,
and he got a text from Heather

37:38.517 --> 37:40.432
20 minutes ago
saying she and a new recruit

37:40.475 --> 37:42.695
were on their way to fulfill
the next great mission.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.479
- Did she say where they were
going, what their target is?

37:44.523 --> 37:46.829
- No, but she sent a picture
of the new recruit.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.792
- Where are they?

37:52.835 --> 37:54.359
Where's the bomb?

37:54.402 --> 37:55.708
Where are they?
- OA.

37:55.751 --> 37:56.883
- Where are they?
- What's going on?

37:56.926 --> 37:58.188
Hey--
- Where is she?

37:58.232 --> 38:00.190
Where is she?
- OA, back off.

38:00.234 --> 38:02.018
- You have three seconds.

38:12.768 --> 38:16.032
Excuse me.
Sorry.

38:19.732 --> 38:23.910
- ♪ Amazing grace

38:23.953 --> 38:27.000
♪ How sweet...

38:27.043 --> 38:29.524
- OA, to the right.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.622
Excuse me.

38:50.676 --> 38:52.373
- Stand back.

38:52.417 --> 38:55.507
- Heather, I'm Agent Zidan,
that's my little sister.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.770
Please don't do anything
stupid.

38:57.813 --> 39:00.294
You activate that phone,
you, me,

39:00.338 --> 39:02.601
and 300 innocent people
go up in flames.

39:02.644 --> 39:05.125
- These people aren't innocent,

39:05.168 --> 39:06.996
they preach hate and venom.

39:07.040 --> 39:09.129
- That's their right,

39:09.172 --> 39:11.784
just like it's yours
to speak against it.

39:11.827 --> 39:16.528
- "Flowing brooks, so longs
my soul for you, o God."

39:18.660 --> 39:20.401
Now as we gather here today...

39:20.445 --> 39:22.142
- Napalm's in the casket,
isn't it?

39:22.185 --> 39:24.579
You bypass security,
nobody checks it.

39:24.623 --> 39:27.495
- Just stop.

39:27.539 --> 39:29.367
It's time to take action.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.238
It's us or them.

39:31.281 --> 39:33.545
- No. You're wrong.

39:33.588 --> 39:35.677
It's us andthem.

39:35.721 --> 39:38.288
That's what this country
is all about.

39:38.332 --> 39:39.942
Being able to be different.

39:39.986 --> 39:44.382
Being able to disagree.

39:44.425 --> 39:47.472
- Just hand me the phone, okay?

39:47.515 --> 39:50.300
Before you do something
you can't walk back.

39:50.344 --> 39:52.781
Look, Heather, right now
you're just a college kid

39:52.825 --> 39:54.348
with a phone.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.437
No one's been hurt.
No one's been injured.

39:56.481 --> 39:58.483
- We need to make a point.

39:58.526 --> 40:01.181
Bain's loyalists
need to suffer.

40:01.224 --> 40:04.227
- And what about the 300 other
people in here, huh?

40:04.271 --> 40:05.881
The wives,

40:05.925 --> 40:07.622
the children, you?

40:10.146 --> 40:11.974
- No, he--

40:12.018 --> 40:15.413
he said it--it would just be
the leaders in the first row.

40:15.456 --> 40:16.805
- And you believed him.

40:20.592 --> 40:22.332
- Professor Will is a liar.

40:22.376 --> 40:24.117
And he's a coward.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.727
He's using you, Heather.

40:25.771 --> 40:27.207
But he doesn't care
what happens to you

40:27.250 --> 40:28.600
or the other students.

40:28.643 --> 40:31.733
- No. He's a great man.
A brave man.

40:31.777 --> 40:33.692
- Then why isn't he here?

40:37.783 --> 40:40.263
- Just hand me the phone,
Heather, please.

40:43.223 --> 40:45.747
Don't blow your life up
over this.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.229
- Don't blow it up over him,
Heather.

40:50.665 --> 40:53.407
He's not worth it,
I promise you.

41:03.112 --> 41:04.766
- Please.

41:35.536 --> 41:37.320
- You okay?

41:40.498 --> 41:42.804
- Please don't be mad at me.

41:42.848 --> 41:44.371
I'm really sorry.

41:44.414 --> 41:47.113
I'm an idiot.
- No. You're not.

41:50.116 --> 41:53.075
You're a hero.

41:53.119 --> 41:55.687
You helped save a lot of lives
up there.

42:00.213 --> 42:02.084
I'm proud of you.

42:04.217 --> 42:06.306
- Really?

42:06.349 --> 42:08.787
- Yeah, really.
