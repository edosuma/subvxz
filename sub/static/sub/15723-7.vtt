WEBVTT

00:00.739 --> 00:02.201
- What's she doing here?
- You hired her.

00:02.466 --> 00:03.883
- I did?
- I'm confused.

00:04.099 --> 00:04.802
Hello, David.

00:06.150 --> 00:08.567
Why can't two grown
drunk people act

00:08.830 --> 00:10.787
like two grown drunk people?

00:11.875 --> 00:14.561
That's when my dad
came up with the idea to make a clone.

00:14.871 --> 00:17.445
He used you to save your brother.

00:18.217 --> 00:20.219
He was diagnosed with
leukaemia a year ago.

00:20.471 --> 00:22.089
Do you got any proof that the
therapy caused the stroke?

00:22.395 --> 00:24.937
I think that the Peterson boy's
immune system over-responded.

00:25.260 --> 00:27.191
- But you don't know.
- Neither does Booker.

00:27.717 --> 00:29.075
The boy was sick.

00:29.579 --> 00:31.752
He died of a disease that
we were trying to save him from.

00:32.046 --> 00:34.680
You studied the therapy.
Does it work or doesn't it work?

00:35.115 --> 00:37.035
He might have suffered a stroke
with or without the treatment.

00:37.333 --> 00:38.655
You're willing to bet
lives on that, Carlos?

00:38.971 --> 00:41.319
The question that we are
dealing with here is:

00:41.553 --> 00:44.793
if 3,000 kids get this treatment,
will 1 die or 1,000?

00:45.353 --> 00:47.040
He's in a coma, David.

00:47.408 --> 00:49.181
- Who?
- Justin... Ricci!

00:49.689 --> 00:50.629
You....!

00:51.224 --> 00:54.112
You signed that
boy's death sentence!

00:54.489 --> 00:55.227
You!

00:57.035 --> 00:59.603
If Mick... you know,
he had a dream too,

00:59.819 --> 01:02.234
- he should like totally go for it.
- Absolutely.

01:02.505 --> 01:04.137
- And I should help him.
- Of course.

01:04.441 --> 01:05.666
- Yeah, okay, bye.
- Bye.

01:09.994 --> 01:12.779
This here is your
Mr. George Edward Plane.

01:13.620 --> 01:15.441
Oh, you're fucking beautiful.

01:15.967 --> 01:19.045
I found it.
A sample of the 1918 flu.

01:19.559 --> 01:20.730
A perfect specimen.

02:48.883 --> 02:51.932
1x07 - Faint Hope

02:56.737 --> 02:57.969
A hundred and two,

02:58.253 --> 02:59.925
a hundred and two.
It's Kobe in the heat.

03:02.685 --> 03:04.396
You ever consider table tennis?

03:05.262 --> 03:07.132
I thought you were on a flight to Houston.

03:08.262 --> 03:10.114
The cab's on its way.

03:10.448 --> 03:12.431
How's the pathology
on Justin Ricci going?

03:12.621 --> 03:14.288
I should have results soon.

03:16.641 --> 03:18.600
- You're throwing it at me?
- To you.

03:18.703 --> 03:21.734
David, we ran all the tests on
the gene treatment. It checked out.

03:22.269 --> 03:23.521
Shut up and play.

03:24.217 --> 03:25.941
The kid's in a coma, Carlos.

03:26.315 --> 03:29.922
Four hours after taking the treatment
in the trial that I sent him to.

03:35.538 --> 03:37.302
I should have been more closely involved.

03:38.327 --> 03:41.036
Oh, what? You're saying you're
the only one who could have done it right?

03:45.472 --> 03:47.534
The whole lab worked on it, David.

03:48.344 --> 03:50.098
If something was missed,

03:52.911 --> 03:54.034
then we all missed it.

03:54.445 --> 03:57.305
Well, I don't know about you,
but I'm not used to missing.

04:10.911 --> 04:12.108
Have a nice flight.

04:32.568 --> 04:33.739
Hey, David.

04:34.896 --> 04:36.315
Hit me.

04:37.372 --> 04:40.505
Oh, I got the brain scans
you ordered on the kids that survived.

04:40.878 --> 04:41.793
Let me see.

04:42.512 --> 04:44.755
Okay. Of course, these kids didn't have
a blast crisis

04:44.854 --> 04:47.384
or a cytokine storm.
They look pretty normal.

04:52.172 --> 04:54.664
- What do you think?
- I think they look pretty normal.

04:55.103 --> 04:55.824
Mayko?

04:56.868 --> 04:58.316
Isn't it a little early for that?

04:58.693 --> 05:00.089
It's never too early for basketball.

05:00.558 --> 05:03.004
Did you rerun the comparisons
on Peterson's and Ricci's genes?

05:03.463 --> 05:05.409
- You want to see the cyto genetic workup?
- Yeah.

05:08.856 --> 05:11.735
And all the kids in the trials
had the same chromosomal abnormality?

05:11.936 --> 05:13.579
Uh-hmm. An 8-11 translocation.

05:14.308 --> 05:17.573
It's just the kind of messed up chromosomal
you expect in an AML patient.

05:17.967 --> 05:20.462
Are we sure the RNA inhibitor
got to the leukaemia cells?

05:20.778 --> 05:23.967
In all the cases. The viral injection did
what it was supposed to do.

05:23.968 --> 05:24.968
Oh, fuck.

05:25.883 --> 05:27.806
Look, David. I know I was pushing you.

05:28.093 --> 05:30.143
- I mean, if you had more time you...
- And I would have made the same call

05:30.446 --> 05:32.886
and I would still be wondering
why Peterson and Ricci

05:33.077 --> 05:34.813
reacted differently to the treats.

05:45.349 --> 05:47.982
There's nothing wrong with
the decision to continue the trial.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.067
We made the right call at the time.

05:50.115 --> 05:51.939
Can you explain what
happened to the Ricci boy?

05:52.267 --> 05:55.412
He had a stroke like the Peterson kid,
but not because of the same thing.

05:55.601 --> 05:56.647
What then?

05:57.169 --> 06:00.334
Peterson had what we
call a cytokine storm,

06:00.747 --> 06:04.095
which is too many immune activating
proteins in his system.

06:04.996 --> 06:06.084
And that's bad?

06:06.185 --> 06:08.352
Too many of anything in the body is bad.

06:09.299 --> 06:14.021
- Okay, what about Justin Ricci?
- Ah, he had what we call blast crisis.

06:14.404 --> 06:16.901
Blast cells are these little baby cells,
cancerous ones,

06:17.262 --> 06:20.983
and you get too many of those guys in
your system and the same thing can result.

06:21.021 --> 06:21.868
You know: coma, death.

06:21.869 --> 06:24.207
But caused by
something totally different.

06:24.561 --> 06:26.877
Exactly. So, is it the treatment,

06:26.878 --> 06:28.157
or is it a coincidence,

06:28.594 --> 06:30.674
something to do with the two kids,

06:30.775 --> 06:33.352
or is it just plain old bad luck?

06:34.677 --> 06:36.950
- Well?
- Place your bets.

07:39.498 --> 07:41.114
Excuse me, can I help you?

07:41.509 --> 07:44.178
Yeah, I need everything you've got
on Justin Ricci for the last 24 hours:

07:44.523 --> 07:47.228
Blood tests, brain scans,
a copy of this chart, everything.

07:47.861 --> 07:48.522
Okay.

08:22.917 --> 08:23.822
Carlito!

08:32.155 --> 08:34.346
I was just thinking of you.

08:35.375 --> 08:36.964
You look good.

08:37.095 --> 08:38.369
I look good?

08:39.789 --> 08:42.841
Oh, my God! Carlos! You're going blind!

08:46.909 --> 08:51.380
I didn't know what to get you,
so I emptied out the airport gift shop.

08:52.307 --> 08:54.891
Blue Jays mug, salt water taffy,

08:55.714 --> 08:57.707
maple leaf-shaped, maple fudge.

08:58.540 --> 09:01.460
Carlos, how am I supposed
to keep my girlish figure?

09:06.913 --> 09:09.078
Why didn't you
let me know sooner?

09:09.448 --> 09:11.631
I did. You're here.

09:27.732 --> 09:30.180
My T-cell count's not so hot, huh?

09:31.220 --> 09:33.526
Your CD4+ is 11%.

09:34.834 --> 09:37.238
There are things we can do.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.419
Are we talking cure?

09:40.727 --> 09:42.879
We're talking quality of life, Lloyd.

09:43.278 --> 09:46.796
Ah, give me a break.
What about something experimental?

09:47.178 --> 09:50.515
Some of this cutting edge technology
my broker's always telling me about.

09:51.184 --> 09:55.442
- There's nothing on the market.
- Then we go off-market.

09:56.054 --> 09:59.359
Carlos, what do you know about
long-term non-progressors?

10:00.437 --> 10:02.084
I've dated a few.

10:05.174 --> 10:07.724
You haven't lost your sense of humour.

10:10.810 --> 10:11.582
David.

10:11.905 --> 10:12.579
Uh-huh?

10:12.750 --> 10:14.065
Can I grab a signature from you?

10:14.231 --> 10:15.006
What for?

10:15.425 --> 10:17.572
I put together the patent application.

10:18.196 --> 10:19.394
Oh, yeah.

10:22.061 --> 10:25.327
Flu strain 777456.

10:26.901 --> 10:28.049
It sounds kind of dull.

10:28.939 --> 10:31.056
Government protocol.
It's all very official.

10:31.527 --> 10:33.973
Hmm. She'll always
be my Spanish lady.

10:34.693 --> 10:37.574
So, after I file, do you want me
to get it over to the WHO?

10:37.888 --> 10:40.247
- What for?
- A vaccine.

10:40.774 --> 10:42.486
Who decided that?

10:43.148 --> 10:45.601
They're the biggest, fastest lab equipped
to make the vaccine.

10:45.943 --> 10:49.567
- I thought it was a no-brainer.
- No. None. No data. Nothing leaves here.

10:49.977 --> 10:52.687
David, we have a pending patent.
We're protected, they can't...

10:53.015 --> 10:54.902
like they even would, but they can't rip us off.

10:55.437 --> 10:59.259
I just don't want the WHO, or any lab
for that matter, working on my shit.

10:59.414 --> 11:02.019
- Our shit.
- Yeah. You know what I mean.

11:02.455 --> 11:04.905
No, actually, I don't know what you mean.

11:05.702 --> 11:07.871
We're going to make a vaccine right here.

11:08.448 --> 11:10.677
And then we'll think
about letting it out.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.548
You're not serious!

11:12.955 --> 11:15.547
Do I look like
I'm wearing a clown costume?

11:15.933 --> 11:18.756
David, the World Health Organization
has more manpower, more equipment,

11:19.102 --> 11:21.551
they could probably come up with a
vaccine in less than a year.

11:21.803 --> 11:25.400
What's the hurry? We found her,
I want to go all the way with her.

11:26.832 --> 11:28.750
Okay, so this is like an ego thing?

11:29.287 --> 11:30.491
Yeah, okay, I'll go with that.

11:31.078 --> 11:34.805
Jill, file the patent and we're going
to make the vaccine right here, okay?

11:36.138 --> 11:37.906
- Whatever you say, boss.
- Thank you.

11:45.279 --> 11:47.081
HIV is killing my CD4s

11:47.144 --> 11:49.945
and my CD8s aren't going
to respond to a head cold,

11:50.288 --> 11:51.824
let alone something more serious.

11:52.440 --> 11:55.231
They're making progress with the
virus every day, Lloyd.

11:55.739 --> 11:56.776
No, I've read everything:

11:57.189 --> 12:00.827
From the effects of potent anti-retroviral
therapy on Kaposi's Sarcoma,

12:01.349 --> 12:05.414
to the uses of labelled glucose
to study lymphocyte replication.

12:05.981 --> 12:08.248
And finally, you got to
long term non-progressors?

12:08.690 --> 12:13.061
These people, Carlos, they're HIV-positive
and they never get AIDS.

12:13.997 --> 12:15.555
They can save me.

12:16.512 --> 12:18.459
You can save me.

12:24.476 --> 12:27.123
Welcome. Between Quebec City
and the Atlantic Ocean

12:27.424 --> 12:29.544
lies a region of stunning beauty,

12:29.832 --> 12:31.601
a majestic landscapes of dense forests

12:31.922 --> 12:34.874
and breath-taking fjords carved out
by ancient glaciers.

12:38.242 --> 12:39.463
Are you okay?

12:39.962 --> 12:42.672
Oh yeah, I'm just a little bit stiff
from sitting down so...

12:43.049 --> 12:45.261
Mick, your nose is like, bleeding.

12:45.544 --> 12:47.979
Shit! No, it's okay,
it happens all the time.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.315
Yeah, yeah, it happens
to my mom too,

12:52.547 --> 12:54.897
and, she blames it on thin blood,

12:55.377 --> 12:58.943
but I think it's because
she's a record producer. Never mind.

12:59.839 --> 13:03.251
Don't worry, just keep reading,
it'll stop in a couple minutes.

13:05.581 --> 13:08.499
Here the Saguenay River meets
the mighty St. Lawrence

13:08.905 --> 13:11.790
and many species of whales:
the finback, humpback,

13:12.397 --> 13:15.329
hunchback, horseback and paperback...

13:15.648 --> 13:17.474
What are talking about?

13:18.373 --> 13:19.990
Just seeing if you're listening.

13:41.141 --> 13:42.891
- Do you have a minute?
- What do you want, Wes?

13:43.688 --> 13:46.359
Caroline asked me to go
through Booker's finances.

13:46.814 --> 13:47.747
Why?

13:48.307 --> 13:51.411
We became aware that he gets stock options
if the treatment goes to market.

13:52.155 --> 13:56.036
You know, there's this little thing
in the Western world called capitalism, Wes.

13:56.187 --> 13:58.430
It can get ugly,
but we allow individuals to compete

13:58.511 --> 13:59.908
for their own financial gain.

14:00.174 --> 14:03.373
Well, he stands to gain a lot of
money if this gene therapy is approved.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.487
Don't you find that a bit unethical?

14:05.802 --> 14:08.321
He has a PhD in molecular biology

14:08.613 --> 14:10.697
and he gets paid less than
an interior decorator.

14:10.873 --> 14:12.238
That's what's unethical.

14:12.387 --> 14:15.493
I'm just suggesting that Booker has a little
incentive to push this therapy through.

14:16.284 --> 14:18.079
Okay, so the
thinking is what?

14:18.462 --> 14:19.900
That after 20 years in a lab,

14:20.274 --> 14:23.077
Booker's going to throw away his reputation
for a couple of stock options?

14:24.157 --> 14:28.215
Actually, $2,750,000 worth
of stock options.

14:31.356 --> 14:32.916
Oh.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.150
Yeah?

14:38.709 --> 14:41.336
- Hey, Carlos, where are you?
- I'm still in Houston.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.406
- How's...
- Not good.

14:43.934 --> 14:47.160
David, do you know about the research
Judy Beewick has been doing on HIV?

14:47.582 --> 14:50.073
- Yeah, it's pretty hot there.
- Do you know her?

14:51.867 --> 14:54.059
Carlos, I hope you're not
thinking what I think you're...

14:54.162 --> 14:55.522
Do you know her, David?

14:57.074 --> 14:59.009
We've met at conferences.

14:59.044 --> 15:01.198
- Have you pissed her off?
- Probably,

15:01.468 --> 15:03.634
eventually, I piss everybody off.

15:03.979 --> 15:08.012
She works with HIV-positive people
who never get AIDS,

15:08.013 --> 15:09.164
non-progressors.

15:09.489 --> 15:11.120
Wait a minute, how bad is your friend?

15:11.745 --> 15:13.924
His HIV RNA is at a million copies.

15:15.168 --> 15:16.289
Jesus, Carlos, I'm sorry.

15:17.679 --> 15:20.920
- Hello, David?
- Carlos? Carlos, you are still there?

15:21.578 --> 15:23.137
- Hello?
- Call me back.

15:24.777 --> 15:26.726
Great! Ow!

15:27.193 --> 15:27.673
Shit!

15:28.906 --> 15:30.612
What the hell happened?

15:31.223 --> 15:33.203
- Darkness!
- My LC/MS run.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.341
I'll lose the vacuum,
I need emergency back up.

15:36.025 --> 15:39.370
Bob, relax, it's already tied
into the emergency generator.

15:45.769 --> 15:48.632
- Right. It looks like it's citywide.
- Are we secure?

15:49.001 --> 15:50.937
We're good, the system's on back-up.

15:50.938 --> 15:52.728
They say it could be as bad as '03.

15:53.151 --> 15:56.668
Not just Toronto, oh,
but the entire North-Eastern seaboard.

15:57.013 --> 15:58.602
I have an announcement to make.

15:59.051 --> 16:01.420
I will be having scrambled
leftovers at my place tonight

16:01.933 --> 16:04.097
for anyone stranded
without a gas stove.

16:05.487 --> 16:07.144
- Bingo!
- Free food!

16:13.254 --> 16:15.555
Our cells have padlocks,

16:15.556 --> 16:18.332
which HIV needs a key to open.

16:18.682 --> 16:21.330
Long-term non-progressors' cells have

16:21.331 --> 16:23.448
padlocks without keyholes.

16:24.441 --> 16:25.872
HIV can't get in.

16:26.159 --> 16:29.935
- So, how do you change your lock?
- Stem cells.

16:32.857 --> 16:34.010
It's me.

16:34.752 --> 16:36.294
In the dark, how about you?

16:36.429 --> 16:39.422
We should boil the drinking
water 3 to 5 minutes, not 35 minutes.

16:40.110 --> 16:42.082
No power in Baltimore?
How big is this?

16:44.717 --> 16:46.065
Any chance it's terrorism?

16:47.592 --> 16:51.037
Congresswoman Schuller, I don't think
being trapped in an elevator's funny.

16:51.753 --> 16:54.003
No. Right, right, save your batteries.

16:54.004 --> 16:54.959
Okay, good night.

16:55.745 --> 16:57.582
I'm eating at David's tonight.

16:58.666 --> 17:01.646
Wow! Hey Mom, you have
to go out and look at the stars.

17:02.132 --> 17:04.640
No, Mom, electricity doesn't
hold up a balcony!

17:05.781 --> 17:06.984
Look at the stars.

17:07.731 --> 17:09.494
The stars are unbelievable.

17:10.210 --> 17:12.582
Just like when I was back
in Vietnam.

17:13.733 --> 17:16.731
Diane! No, I'm sorry sweetie,
I'm losing you.

17:18.796 --> 17:22.450
Can you e-mail me?
No, that's not going to work.

17:23.098 --> 17:24.768
Hello? Diane?

17:27.288 --> 17:29.336
- So, are you coming for dinner?
- Hi!

17:30.824 --> 17:33.367
Uh, no, thank you.

17:33.546 --> 17:35.382
You're mad about the patent.

17:37.126 --> 17:40.138
No, David, you're the boss. All right?

17:40.339 --> 17:42.995
Well, is this about Chicago?

17:44.633 --> 17:46.052
What? No!

17:46.820 --> 17:48.773
Why aren't you coming for dinner?

17:50.129 --> 17:52.423
Because! I don't know--

17:52.895 --> 17:55.149
It's dark and I'm going to go home.

17:55.350 --> 17:58.226
Have a bubble bath, climb into bed.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.758
Can I come?

18:00.959 --> 18:03.169
You're hosting a dinner party.

18:05.074 --> 18:07.350
Well, not all night!

18:22.896 --> 18:24.480
Come on in, it's open.

18:29.171 --> 18:31.027
Oh hey, Bob.
Come on in, what's up?

18:31.890 --> 18:36.079
I brought wine, I had some left over.
My cousin brought it.

18:36.637 --> 18:37.870
Great, come on in.

18:38.109 --> 18:40.174
Gamelon doesn't like
being alone in the dark.

18:40.405 --> 18:41.661
- Well, where is she?
- Outside.

18:42.041 --> 18:43.841
You want her to come in?

18:49.458 --> 18:50.534
Behave yourself.

18:50.835 --> 18:51.928
Go! Go!

18:53.528 --> 18:56.890
Hey, hi! So what are
we having for dinner?

18:58.266 --> 19:00.461
I brought wine, I didn't
want it to go bad.

19:00.896 --> 19:01.864
Ah hello, Mayko.

19:02.143 --> 19:04.727
Yeah, okay, so I froze it
in my ice cube trays.

19:05.262 --> 19:07.610
- That's a good idea.
- Now, it's melting.

19:07.801 --> 19:09.308
Think of it as ice wine.

19:15.736 --> 19:17.906
- Morrison.
- Caroline, it's me Digby.

19:18.109 --> 19:20.972
- You guys still in the dark over there?
- Yeah. We are.

19:21.179 --> 19:23.869
Our cell phones are off and on
so you better get to your point.

19:24.019 --> 19:27.197
Right, I've got an update on our friend
Martin Jamieson aka William Zanzinger.

19:27.498 --> 19:27.989
Shoot.

19:28.272 --> 19:30.083
It turns out we're not the only ones
looking for him.

19:30.370 --> 19:31.645
- Who else?
- Oh, you name it!

19:31.941 --> 19:35.327
The South-Africans, Pakistanis, I believe
the American expression is "can of worms".

19:35.687 --> 19:38.564
- Yeah. Why Pakistan?
- I don't know yet.

19:39.356 --> 19:41.979
But wasn't that scientist
that was murdered outside your office...

19:42.157 --> 19:44.721
Hira Khan, yeah. She was Pakistani.

19:45.070 --> 19:47.149
The closer we get, the bigger it gets.

19:47.595 --> 19:49.166
- Caroline?
- Digby?

19:49.967 --> 19:51.809
- Hello? Hello?
- Hello?

19:55.033 --> 19:55.780
Thanks.

20:00.177 --> 20:01.965
What do you say?
Zucchini or courgettes?

20:02.713 --> 20:03.771
It's eggplant, Bob.

20:04.285 --> 20:06.882
I know the difference
between an aubergine and courgette.

20:07.232 --> 20:09.118
I don't understand
the question then, what do you...

20:09.428 --> 20:12.759
So, this is kind of romantic.
Candlelight, a dog...

20:12.901 --> 20:15.571
Did you have a nice day at
the office today, honey?

20:15.625 --> 20:18.411
Why, yes dear, very nice,
I schtuped my secretary at lunch.

20:18.694 --> 20:20.859
Oh again? You are a devil, aren't you?

20:21.063 --> 20:23.023
Uh-huh, and then, I made
enough crack cocaine to buy you

20:23.139 --> 20:24.910
that little house in the Annex
you've had your eye on.

20:25.108 --> 20:27.717
Oh, you are so sweet. Then,
I'm going to stop seeing the pool boy.

20:31.807 --> 20:34.007
Any new thoughts on the
gene treatment?

20:34.267 --> 20:37.375
I'm thinking maybe they should revisit
the whole immune response in animals.

20:37.963 --> 20:39.561
You mean, stop the trials?

20:45.766 --> 20:49.459
I'm sorry. Gamelon's been having
some digestive problems lately.

20:49.962 --> 20:51.955
Oh, for a second there,
I thought it was the wine.

20:52.035 --> 20:54.384
Was this sparkling before you froze it?

20:54.573 --> 20:54.985
No.

20:56.083 --> 20:58.665
I think you're reinvented
double fermentation.

20:59.136 --> 21:01.346
- Thank you.
- That's a lot of bubbles.

21:02.290 --> 21:05.926
- What about the bubble boy?
- What about what bubble boy?

21:06.223 --> 21:09.015
You remember the SCID
gene treatment trials?

21:09.421 --> 21:12.422
The kids with immune deficiency syndrome
were treated with a virus

21:12.764 --> 21:14.206
that delivered the missing gene.

21:14.207 --> 21:16.634
Oh right. Then 3 years later,
all the kids got leukaemia

21:16.904 --> 21:20.223
because the viral DNA inserted itself
next to the wrong gene in the cell.

21:20.685 --> 21:24.501
So it replaced the gene. But, also
inadvertently activated a cancer-causing gene.

21:24.896 --> 21:26.939
Are we thinking that
might have happened to Justin Ricci?

21:27.004 --> 21:29.604
The viral RNAI silenced another gene too?

21:29.680 --> 21:31.407
- Maybe. Maybe... What are you guy doing?
- Talking to you.

21:31.685 --> 21:33.144
No, I mean tonight. Let's go to the lab.

21:33.876 --> 21:34.980
Sure. Gamelon, come on.

21:35.563 --> 21:37.728
Can we eat, first?

22:24.011 --> 22:27.265
Okay, whatever
you do, just don't smile.

22:27.711 --> 22:30.118
- Why not?
- I hate fake smiles.

22:30.134 --> 22:31.945
How do you know it's fake?

22:31.962 --> 22:33.894
How do you know
I'm not actually happy?

22:36.125 --> 22:37.777
So, what do you want to do?

22:41.840 --> 22:43.213
- Okay.
- Thanks.

22:45.268 --> 22:46.386
What's wrong?

22:49.543 --> 22:51.112
Nothing. It's just...

22:52.091 --> 22:53.653
It's weird.

22:53.654 --> 22:54.629
What?

22:55.551 --> 22:57.703
We're in a motel.

22:57.704 --> 22:58.472
Yeah.

22:59.363 --> 23:00.301
Together.

23:00.922 --> 23:01.986
Yeah.

23:02.209 --> 23:03.055
All alone.

23:07.289 --> 23:08.685
I guess I...

23:09.080 --> 23:12.321
Is this whole whale watching thing
just some ploy

23:12.496 --> 23:14.481
to get me in a motel room with you?

23:15.358 --> 23:18.130
Yeah, that's why
I caused the black out too.

23:24.392 --> 23:27.111
Like, have you ever done it?

23:28.414 --> 23:29.856
Done what?

23:30.653 --> 23:32.432
You know what I mean.

23:34.088 --> 23:37.120
- Like, sex?
- Yeah.

23:39.392 --> 23:40.625
- No. You?
- No.

23:42.245 --> 23:42.965
You?

23:43.856 --> 23:44.508
No.

23:45.374 --> 23:46.585
No?

23:47.901 --> 23:49.688
Don't sound so surprised.

23:50.488 --> 23:51.665
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to...

23:52.100 --> 23:53.319
No, it's okay.

23:55.384 --> 23:56.808
What about you?

23:57.276 --> 23:59.521
No, not even close.

24:04.267 --> 24:06.393
I was just...

24:08.765 --> 24:11.481
I was just wondering if you wanted...

24:15.600 --> 24:17.523
Before you...

24:19.125 --> 24:20.522
Die?

24:30.907 --> 24:33.572
Just to know the feeling.

24:34.238 --> 24:38.484
To know how you feel,
like you know, afterwards.

24:39.197 --> 24:42.170
Hey, it's okay. Don't cry. Don't cry.

24:44.743 --> 24:48.553
I'm all right. Just...

24:57.647 --> 25:00.689
I'm just feeling so bad, Mick.

25:52.087 --> 25:54.091
The process is threefold.

25:55.093 --> 25:58.226
1: Create in-vitro fertilized eggs.

26:01.251 --> 26:03.958
2: Collect stem cells.

26:04.712 --> 26:08.150
These stem cells will become
the new CD4 cells

26:08.587 --> 26:11.468
with the defect that will save lives.

26:11.802 --> 26:12.413
Yes?

26:14.585 --> 26:17.440
Are there non-progressive
stem cells available today?

26:17.803 --> 26:20.449
- No, we'd have to grow them.
- But, isn't that illegal?

26:20.564 --> 26:22.976
That's why we're trying
to change the law.

26:23.269 --> 26:25.872
But a stem cell is a human life.

26:27.001 --> 26:31.362
Well, that would depend upon
your definition of human and life, wouldn't it?

26:31.762 --> 26:33.892
If the stem cell were
to divide and grow,

26:33.893 --> 26:36.262
wouldn't it turn into a baby?

26:36.329 --> 26:38.530
A stem cell is an undifferentiated cell

26:38.606 --> 26:40.919
capable of proliferation, self-renewal,

26:40.985 --> 26:44.545
production of a large number
of differentiated functional progeny,

26:44.660 --> 26:46.109
regenerating tissue after injury...

26:46.392 --> 26:48.692
Do you think you're right
in the eyes of God?

26:49.861 --> 26:53.105
This is graduate science class.
Theology is down the hall.

26:53.945 --> 26:55.393
Okay, that's it for today everybody.

26:55.622 --> 26:59.237
Read chapters 6 and 7,
and I'll read the New Testament.

27:08.017 --> 27:09.683
Excuse me, Dr. Beewick?

27:10.574 --> 27:14.206
I'm Carlos Serrano, I believe
Dr. Sandstrom in Toronto spoke to you?

27:14.581 --> 27:16.405
Ah, yes. David explained your situation.

27:16.882 --> 27:19.944
How close are you to a human test?

27:20.248 --> 27:21.619
Legally, we're ways away.

27:21.910 --> 27:24.077
Scientifically, we just need
the right stem cells.

27:24.454 --> 27:27.448
If I could get you those stem cells from
two non-progressors,

27:27.749 --> 27:29.762
would you include a friend
of mine who has AIDS?

27:30.206 --> 27:32.093
Where are you going to get
these stem cells?

27:32.425 --> 27:33.374
Canada.

27:34.915 --> 27:37.731
So you'd what? Culture the cells yourself
and bring them to me?

27:38.629 --> 27:41.685
If you include my friend in your trial.

27:42.272 --> 27:44.266
You know there are legal issues.

27:44.706 --> 27:47.913
Growing and harvesting stem cells
is perfectly legal in Canada,

27:48.587 --> 27:50.568
so no laws would be broken there.

27:59.835 --> 28:00.663
See ya.

28:02.859 --> 28:04.813
- How's is it going?
- It's good!

28:05.416 --> 28:08.024
It's good.
What do you got Bob so happy about?

28:08.289 --> 28:10.157
Oh, I just like to make him laugh.

28:10.541 --> 28:12.288
Listen, Mayko, I heard a rumour...

28:12.629 --> 28:14.573
I slept with him a long time ago.

28:15.632 --> 28:17.384
Oh, you slept with Bob?

28:17.824 --> 28:19.585
Oh no! God, no!

28:20.931 --> 28:24.343
Oh, yeah, no, I heard a rumour that there's
actually a city outside of this building.

28:24.928 --> 28:28.966
- Yeah, it's a big fun city.
- Really? We should go out sometime.

28:29.505 --> 28:30.998
You know, stir up some trouble.

28:31.548 --> 28:32.235
Sure.

28:32.256 --> 28:34.122
- When do you want to go?
- He wants to see us.

28:34.792 --> 28:38.304
The microarray analysis shows that the RNAI
was doing what's it was supposed to

28:38.631 --> 28:39.451
and nothing else.

28:39.452 --> 28:43.195
- Okay, so it's not a SCID.
Shit, I thought we had it there.

28:44.788 --> 28:45.926
Fuck it, you know what?

28:46.186 --> 28:48.694
We've got 6 kids in remission,
2 are negatively affected,

28:48.999 --> 28:52.352
but without this treatment,
there'd be 8 kids that are dying.

28:52.694 --> 28:55.504
You know, if I'm wrong,
somebody convince me.

28:56.016 --> 28:58.168
So Justin Ricci was just unlucky?

28:58.169 --> 28:58.834
Maybe.

28:59.923 --> 29:04.011
- Can we be clear about anything?
- I think he was unlucky.

29:04.438 --> 29:07.518
I mean, to have a blast crisis and a stroke,
all within 4 hours?

29:07.912 --> 29:10.429
That's like having 2 car
accidents on the same trip home.

29:10.457 --> 29:11.775
Something like happened to me,

29:11.776 --> 29:13.669
I was in college
and I went to the laundromat...

29:13.727 --> 29:15.155
- Bob.
- No wait.

29:15.952 --> 29:17.221
What did you just say?

29:17.658 --> 29:19.879
I went to the laundromat and
I forgot my clothes,

29:19.947 --> 29:20.886
so I went back...

29:22.252 --> 29:25.453
No. Justin Ricci
couldn't be that unlucky.

29:26.015 --> 29:29.953
- It does seem kind of quick.
- Why are we fighting this?

29:30.436 --> 29:32.401
If it couldn't happen in 4 hours,

29:32.402 --> 29:34.193
it couldn't happen in 4 hours!

29:34.489 --> 29:36.390
He was already in blast crisis
when he was given the treatment.

29:36.743 --> 29:38.729
He wouldn't have been accepted
in the trial in that condition.

29:38.939 --> 29:40.402
He shouldn't have been
accepted into the trial.

29:40.727 --> 29:41.739
David, we have his records.

29:41.996 --> 29:44.837
He wasn't in blast crisis
when he was approved for trial.

29:47.009 --> 29:48.142
What records?

29:50.333 --> 29:53.104
Hey, did I wake you?

29:54.175 --> 29:57.560
I'm sorry. I'm heading back to Toronto.

29:59.854 --> 30:01.642
I think so.

30:02.640 --> 30:04.571
No, I'm going to make it happen.

30:05.966 --> 30:06.907
Yes.

30:09.543 --> 30:10.600
Okay.

30:11.122 --> 30:12.334
Okay, sleep well.

30:37.574 --> 30:40.490
I just kept wondering if there was
something I was missing, you know?

30:40.873 --> 30:42.524
No, you made the right decision, David.

30:42.757 --> 30:45.007
I think I did.
The question is, did you?

30:45.779 --> 30:46.706
What are you talking about?

30:46.927 --> 30:49.873
Treating the Ricci kid
when he was already in blast crisis.

30:50.687 --> 30:53.138
How can you think that? I mean,
you read his prep charts, didn't you?

30:53.380 --> 30:56.075
Yeah, most of them. His white blood cell counts
were being checked daily

30:56.340 --> 30:58.580
and they were rising on their way
towards a blast crisis.

30:58.796 --> 31:00.874
We have inclusion/exclusion
criteria that he met.

31:01.221 --> 31:02.921
For Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.

31:03.213 --> 31:05.296
You gave him the
treatment on Wednesday.

31:05.632 --> 31:07.466
By Wednesday the Ricci kid was so sick,

31:07.749 --> 31:10.721
he couldn't take the treatment,
you gave him the shot anyway.

31:11.025 --> 31:12.510
I wasn't aware he was outside
the trial parameters.

31:12.851 --> 31:14.539
Oh, what? You didn't read
the prep report?

31:14.782 --> 31:16.540
All right, cut the bullshit.
You know what I think?

31:16.846 --> 31:19.051
I think you palmed Wednesday's report
and you gave him the treatment.

31:19.306 --> 31:22.037
If it failed, well it's all due
to sudden onset blast crisis,

31:22.310 --> 31:23.854
but if it succeeds,
well you can tell the world

31:24.236 --> 31:26.512
that your treatment's
even better than you claim.

31:26.867 --> 31:29.835
The white blood cell count report
was lost in the hospital's internal mail.

31:30.118 --> 31:31.729
I've used that excuse
a couple of times myself.

31:31.981 --> 31:36.412
You fucking robbed the Riccis of what
little time they had left with their son.

31:37.509 --> 31:39.363
You need a reality check, Sandstrom.

31:44.473 --> 31:47.077
- I tried to save their son's life.
- You failed.

31:47.648 --> 31:50.455
- The point is I tried.
- This isn't your call, Booker.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.326
What are you talking about?

31:52.685 --> 31:55.047
The Riccis begged me to give
their son the treatment.

31:55.407 --> 31:57.935
They knew their son was in blast crisis?

31:58.085 --> 31:59.111
Yes, of course.

31:59.643 --> 32:00.737
Jesus!

32:00.976 --> 32:03.102
I told them he'd have
to be excluded from the trial.

32:03.399 --> 32:05.186
Then why wasn't he?

32:06.013 --> 32:09.260
His chances of recovering
from blast crisis is 0, David.

32:11.127 --> 32:14.059
They begged me to save their son,
they pleaded.

32:16.452 --> 32:18.886
You corrupted the trials on a wild gamble

32:18.887 --> 32:21.966
and then tried to cover it up.
That's reason enough to end them.

32:22.218 --> 32:24.522
Would have refused the chance,
no matter how small, how remote,

32:25.003 --> 32:26.436
to save a child's life?

32:29.964 --> 32:32.020
Say nothing, nothing happens.

32:39.978 --> 32:42.041
Judy Beewick thought this
was a good idea?

32:42.257 --> 32:44.403
- Guess I got her on a good day.
- So what do you want me to do?

32:44.663 --> 32:46.423
Well, you know AIDS doctors,

32:46.607 --> 32:47.645
you have contacts at in-vitro clinics.

32:47.660 --> 32:49.985
Carlos, first of all, you've got to get
a couple of non-progressors,

32:50.347 --> 32:51.839
a male and a female.

32:52.096 --> 32:53.968
It's easy, researchers
have databases on them.

32:54.345 --> 32:57.703
Yeah, well there's a small minor detail
called confidentiality.

32:58.067 --> 33:01.439
We get around it.
We play the professional courtesy card.

33:02.073 --> 33:04.167
Okay. Then you've got to get
them to fertilize.

33:04.459 --> 33:06.558
What? We take an egg and
we do it in the lab.

33:06.876 --> 33:08.060
You've got to get them to
agree to it first.

33:08.352 --> 33:11.833
It's for research David.
What HIV-positive person would say no?

33:12.170 --> 33:14.149
How are you going to smuggle
the stem cells into the States?

33:14.397 --> 33:16.398
You're going to hide them into
a tub of butter brickle ice cream?

33:16.730 --> 33:18.608
We send them the way we send
all NorBAC samples.

33:18.958 --> 33:21.498
Caroline's never going to let NorBAC
get involved in something like this.

33:21.925 --> 33:24.442
Cut the bullshit, David. Okay?
She'll never know.

33:28.272 --> 33:30.447
What the fuck is going on here, Carlos?

33:37.369 --> 33:39.039
Lloyd was my first lover.

33:40.983 --> 33:44.614
I had a hard time
coming to grips with who I was

33:45.185 --> 33:46.235
and he helped me.

33:49.404 --> 33:50.892
Are you okay?

33:52.458 --> 33:54.553
Am I HIV-positive?

33:55.186 --> 33:56.532
No.

34:12.523 --> 34:13.618
Well...

34:18.187 --> 34:20.771
it looks like we got a lot of work to do.

34:23.264 --> 34:25.768
Dr. Hazard, David Sandstrom from NorBAC.

34:26.108 --> 34:27.241
Good, thank you.
Actually, I'm in a bit of a bind.

34:27.469 --> 34:30.179
We're looking to create
some long-term non-progressor zygotes

34:30.485 --> 34:32.878
and we're in the market
for ova and sperm.

34:33.313 --> 34:35.886
Tonight. Well, can't you miss
the first couple of innings?

34:37.123 --> 34:38.277
Apparently not.

34:38.739 --> 34:41.135
Hi, my name is Carlos Serrano.

34:41.543 --> 34:44.969
Yes, Dr. David Sandstrom
in Toronto gave me your name.

34:45.429 --> 34:46.583
Hello? Hello?

34:47.523 --> 34:49.531
Dr. Diallo, David Sandstrom.

34:57.276 --> 34:59.532
Well, if I said all of that,
it must be true.

34:59.910 --> 35:02.223
I got your name from World Health.

35:02.307 --> 35:05.339
Yes, I'm a research physician
working on non-progressors...

35:05.802 --> 35:08.645
Looking for long-term AIDS non-progressors

35:08.646 --> 35:12.199
who might want to donate eggs or sperm.

35:12.747 --> 35:14.554
Sandstrom, David Sandstrom.

35:20.365 --> 35:22.971
You have the sperm? That's fantastic!

35:23.862 --> 35:28.233
Yes. No, no, no, I'll take it. Okay.
We're going to take care of shipping.

35:29.082 --> 35:29.957
Thank you.

35:42.079 --> 35:44.626
What is it Wes, because
I'm kind of busy?

35:46.893 --> 35:50.465
I understand you're working
on an experimental AIDS therapy.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.638
No, you heard wrong.

35:53.862 --> 35:55.901
You're looking for non-progressor.

36:06.277 --> 36:08.168
I'm HIV-positive.

36:18.215 --> 36:20.884
Are you a non-progressor?

36:22.040 --> 36:23.373
No.

36:26.273 --> 36:29.820
But I have a friend who has
been HIV-positive for 15 years.

36:30.193 --> 36:32.207
Do you know what I'm
planning on doing?

36:32.610 --> 36:34.798
Yes, you're going to need
an egg from another non-progressor.

36:35.122 --> 36:35.748
Yes.

36:40.725 --> 36:43.516
If she doesn't cooperate,
you let me know.

36:45.900 --> 36:48.478
- We never had this conversation.
- Of course.

37:03.815 --> 37:05.222
Are you Iliana?

37:05.337 --> 37:08.070
Tell you what. You don't ask my name,

37:08.107 --> 37:09.686
I won't ask you questions.

37:09.797 --> 37:12.101
My name is Carlos,
I have a favour to ask you.

37:12.279 --> 37:13.541
Hand job's 20, oral is 50.

37:13.764 --> 37:17.211
You want to stick it in, it's
125 for the front or 150 for the back.

37:17.565 --> 37:18.827
It's not that kind of favour.

37:19.217 --> 37:21.188
You want me to fuck your
girlfriend or what?

37:21.529 --> 37:22.705
No, no, I'm serious. Listen to me.

37:22.966 --> 37:25.947
I'm a doctor, okay? A researcher.
I'm working on AIDS.

37:27.042 --> 37:28.927
- I don't have AIDS.
- Well, I know you don't.

37:29.272 --> 37:32.545
Look, you want to have a good time? Okay.
But I don't want to talk about this shit.

37:32.749 --> 37:34.032
Please Iliana, listen to me.

37:34.267 --> 37:37.305
You have an immunity of sorts, something
I think that you can pass along.

37:37.419 --> 37:40.105
If you'd be just willing to have
a simple medical procedure.

37:40.195 --> 37:41.084
What?

37:41.540 --> 37:43.998
We harvest one of your eggs
from your ovaries.

37:44.365 --> 37:46.479
- No. No baby!
- No, no, Iliana, it's not to make a baby.

37:46.739 --> 37:48.867
- Just to take some cells from your body.
- Don't waste my time.

37:49.299 --> 37:51.143
You could save a man's life!

37:51.144 --> 37:53.574
You could save many lives. Please.

37:54.216 --> 37:56.434
It will only take a few hours.

37:58.063 --> 38:00.613
You want Iliana for a few hours?

38:00.614 --> 38:01.371
You pay!

38:01.733 --> 38:04.892
Of course. 200 right now...

38:06.047 --> 38:09.023
and 200 after the procedure.

38:11.264 --> 38:12.964
- No sex!
- No sex.

38:15.475 --> 38:17.674
You've been in Canada too long.

38:33.439 --> 38:35.805
- How's it going?
- Almost ready.

38:36.646 --> 38:38.415
Does it look like a good egg?

38:39.011 --> 38:40.821
If it's anything like the donor,

38:41.117 --> 38:43.207
it will be tough and lively.

38:44.048 --> 38:46.415
I don't know how you do that.

38:47.354 --> 38:50.909
You know, it's a lot easier when somebody
isn't standing over your shoulder, Mayko.

38:51.284 --> 38:54.594
Got it. One false move
and the egg's toast, right?

38:55.548 --> 38:58.023
I'm getting tense just looking at you.

39:00.455 --> 39:02.275
Ready for the spermatozoa?

39:03.651 --> 39:04.420
Okay.

39:16.610 --> 39:19.512
You want to make this
a simultaneous orgasm?

39:36.049 --> 39:39.263
Phew, that was fantastic, Carlos!

39:39.618 --> 39:41.419
You got a cigarette?

39:57.739 --> 39:59.013
Wait, wait.

40:13.915 --> 40:15.655
We're like the only ones here.

40:19.521 --> 40:22.145
I don't know, should I take
a picture of the whale

40:22.595 --> 40:23.851
or you looking at it?

40:25.575 --> 40:28.572
How about I do some whale seeing faces

40:28.669 --> 40:30.759
and then, you don't have to chose?

40:32.508 --> 40:34.763
- Okay, sure.
- Okay.

40:38.421 --> 40:40.653
Look at the whales. Big whales!

41:03.667 --> 41:07.953
Okay. Lloyd, before we do this, there are
a couple of things that you need to know.

41:08.357 --> 41:10.213
1: this is very experimental.

41:10.214 --> 41:13.100
I know, you idiot. I sent you there.

41:14.029 --> 41:16.858
- It may do absolutely nothing.
- Just give it to me.

41:17.928 --> 41:21.315
- Do you know how this is supposed to work?
- What do you want to know?

41:21.793 --> 41:24.809
How the stem cells actually give
my immune system a fighting chance?

41:25.137 --> 41:27.763
You want me to diagram the molecular
structure of a CD8 cell for you?

41:28.020 --> 41:30.081
- Give me that notebook, over there.
- Okay, you've made your point.

41:30.419 --> 41:32.753
Then stop playing doctor.

41:33.058 --> 41:36.144
Although, I must admit
I find it very sexy.

41:37.081 --> 41:38.400
Then shoot me up.

41:41.994 --> 41:43.908
There's one more thing you need to know.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.050
What?

41:48.195 --> 41:50.111
Ti amo mi querido.

41:52.746 --> 41:54.622
I love you too Carlos.

42:22.858 --> 42:24.741
- You want some?
- No, thanks.

42:28.315 --> 42:30.429
- Are you getting cold?
- No.

42:33.006 --> 42:34.441
Any whales?

42:35.535 --> 42:36.869
Any second.

42:42.189 --> 42:43.381
"Bonjour Monsieur."

42:45.107 --> 42:47.461
"Nous sommes ici pour les baleines."

42:48.527 --> 42:50.444
"Oh, les baleines! Ha! Ha! Ha!"

42:52.319 --> 42:54.329
"Ce n'est pas la bonne saison."

42:55.507 --> 42:58.886
- What? Sorry?
- No whales. No whales.

42:59.637 --> 43:00.486
What?

43:00.521 --> 43:03.760
Wrong season. No whales.

43:11.063 --> 43:14.502
Don't listen to him.
We're going to see some.

43:15.840 --> 43:19.951
Seriously, just keep watching,
you're going to see one, I know it.

43:24.683 --> 43:26.474
Here, would you like to try?

43:48.716 --> 43:49.981
- Hey.
- Hey.

43:51.145 --> 43:54.488
- Have you come to a conclusion?
- Yes, I have.

43:57.296 --> 43:59.143
Are you going to share it?

44:01.267 --> 44:02.754
The trials should continue.

44:03.348 --> 44:05.384
What about the Ricci and Peterson kids?

44:05.635 --> 44:07.737
We couldn't connect
their deaths to the treatment.

44:10.720 --> 44:12.754
Oh. Okay, so Booker's clean?

44:15.580 --> 44:17.724
We weren't asked to judge Booker.

44:17.825 --> 44:20.127
We were asked to judge his trial.

44:21.001 --> 44:23.093
I can't know his motivation,

44:23.271 --> 44:25.426
but I know his biology and it's good.

44:25.896 --> 44:27.926
Even if he is a pompous asshole.

44:31.678 --> 44:34.226
But, you know, remenber,
these are trials, so...

44:34.684 --> 44:36.192
All I'm saying right now is that

44:36.193 --> 44:39.668
there's no reason
to say the treatment is bad.

44:40.248 --> 44:43.312
These are very sick kids, so,
is the drug going to save them?

44:43.600 --> 44:45.963
It saved 6 of them,
we need to keep studying it.

44:46.251 --> 44:48.744
- But folding might still be right?
- Sure.

44:48.836 --> 44:50.857
And more kids may die?

44:51.143 --> 44:56.279
Yeah. But, ultimately, this treatment
could save many lives, so...

44:57.214 --> 44:59.518
I don't know how you do it.

45:00.094 --> 45:03.063
- How do you play God?
- Oh, I try not to.

45:03.541 --> 45:05.653
This was your idea, remember?

45:16.048 --> 45:17.257
Oh my God!

45:17.937 --> 45:19.758
Look! I think I see a whale!

45:20.240 --> 45:22.792
Seriously, look, look!
Mick, can you see it?

45:24.858 --> 45:26.026
Mick?

45:28.351 --> 45:29.234
Mick?

45:31.618 --> 45:33.210
Mick? Mick?

46:24.230 --> 46:27.422
Hello, Sarah, it's me.
She's fine, sort of.

46:28.042 --> 46:30.833
A friend of hers died and she's...

46:31.401 --> 46:35.960
No, no, no, natural causes, but
she really needs you out here right now.

46:36.365 --> 46:39.581
- How come you're in Toronto?
- My God! You look so grown up!

46:39.852 --> 46:41.945
Look, I just lost my friend...

46:42.079 --> 46:43.464
my best friend!

46:46.160 --> 46:48.353
All you care about is
putting each other down.

46:48.667 --> 46:49.549
Lilith.

46:50.833 --> 46:53.218
The CIA got intercepts
of a plan to create a black out

46:53.570 --> 46:56.303
and use the chaos to move
terrorists from Canada to the U.S.

46:56.380 --> 46:57.686
Right, blame Canada!

46:58.166 --> 47:01.676
So, underground wires
seemingly spontaneously combust.

47:01.735 --> 47:03.448
And why do they think it's terrorism?

47:03.508 --> 47:05.139
I don't know.
Because that's what you do these days.

47:05.408 --> 47:07.200
You know who's really happy
about this black out?

47:07.532 --> 47:08.248
Who?

47:08.507 --> 47:10.836
That guy on death row who was supposed
to get the chair this morning.

47:11.507 --> 47:14.269
