[guitar music playing]

00:11.945 --> 00:14.240
[Mickey] Dude, this house is insane.

00:14.323 --> 00:16.325
[Gus] Oh, it's fucking nuts, right?

00:16.409 --> 00:18.244
- [Mickey] Fucking nuts.
- Yeah.

00:24.458 --> 00:25.459
Wow.

00:25.543 --> 00:28.003
[chuckles] Wow.

00:28.087 --> 00:30.256
[Gus] Gordon! Peanut!

00:30.339 --> 00:31.841
Oh, there they are.

00:31.924 --> 00:34.635
Oh, there's a Gordon and Peanut!

00:34.718 --> 00:38.639
[in baby talk] There's a Gordon
and a little Peanut. Hi.

00:38.722 --> 00:41.267
Mickey, this is Gordon. This is Peanut.

00:41.350 --> 00:42.976
Peanut, Gordon, this is Mickey.

00:43.060 --> 00:45.688
- Oh. Hi, Gordon and Peanut.
- Give me kisses.

00:45.771 --> 00:49.608
Aw, who are these goofballs?
Who are these goofballs?

00:49.692 --> 00:52.820
Gus, this house is incredible.
Just leave the dogs. Show me around.

00:52.903 --> 00:55.781
- Okay.
- [elevator bell dings]

00:55.864 --> 00:58.784
[chuckles] Well, the elevator works.

00:58.868 --> 01:00.911
Yep. This is nuts.

01:04.290 --> 01:05.458
Wow.

01:06.959 --> 01:08.169
[Mickey chuckles softly]

01:17.845 --> 01:19.347
- This kitchen.
- It's insane.

01:19.430 --> 01:20.806
What's that?

01:20.889 --> 01:22.766
- Uh, a fridge.
- No.

01:22.850 --> 01:24.184
Old-timey fridge.

01:24.268 --> 01:25.561
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:27.730 --> 01:28.930
- Oh, my God!
- [sing-song] Ah!

01:29.815 --> 01:31.484
This is all original.

01:31.567 --> 01:33.026
- Wow.
- Nice. Yeah.

01:33.110 --> 01:35.488
- Oh, my God.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:35.571 --> 01:37.072
- This bedroom's amazing.
- Yeah.

01:37.156 --> 01:38.407
What's in here?

01:39.283 --> 01:41.994
Oh, my God.
She has, like, a million pairs of shoes.

01:42.077 --> 01:44.079
Gus, how many shoes can I steal?

01:44.663 --> 01:47.666
So being a kid actor
can get you a house like this?

01:47.750 --> 01:49.084
Mmm, no.

01:49.167 --> 01:52.045
He just comes from a really rich family
and invested well.

01:52.129 --> 01:54.257
Oh. So like...
everyone I knew in New York.

01:54.340 --> 01:56.467
Mmm-hmm. Now he's married,

01:56.550 --> 02:00.929
so, uh, when he goes out of town,
he just... just asks me to house-sit.

02:01.013 --> 02:02.055
- Mmm.
- Yeah.

02:03.181 --> 02:06.559
This is gonna be such an awesome way
to watch <i>Witchita</i> tomorrow, you know?

02:06.644 --> 02:07.644
Mmm.

02:08.270 --> 02:10.564
Are you flipping out?
You must be flipping out.

02:11.482 --> 02:12.733
- I am.
- [high-pitched] Yeah?

02:12.816 --> 02:14.067
I think my parents are more.

02:14.151 --> 02:17.029
My mom drug out all
the Halloween decorations from the garage

02:17.112 --> 02:20.032
and put 'em at the house
so they'd have witch stuff everywhere.

02:20.115 --> 02:21.116
[clicks tongues] Aw.

02:28.666 --> 02:29.958
Wanna fuck outside?

02:30.834 --> 02:32.586
[both breathing heavily]

02:34.087 --> 02:35.881
[both moaning]

02:36.799 --> 02:38.801
[theme music playing]

02:55.818 --> 02:57.403
[Mickey] Oh, my God.

02:57.486 --> 03:00.948
If Shaun posts one more photo
of her baby wearing sunglasses,

03:01.031 --> 03:03.075
I am unfollowing her for life.

03:03.158 --> 03:06.454
Oh, my God.
I love hearing you shit-talk your friends.

03:06.537 --> 03:07.537
Why?

03:08.330 --> 03:11.166
'Cause it makes me know you, like,
really trust me, you know?

03:11.750 --> 03:14.795
Don't flatter yourself.
I'll shit-talk to anyone who will listen.

03:14.878 --> 03:16.296
Oh. [sniffles]

03:17.965 --> 03:21.009
- Okay, I know this is gross, but...
- Ooh.

03:21.093 --> 03:23.137
Can I please pop a zit on your back?

03:23.637 --> 03:26.515
[inhales sharply] Uh, ugh...

03:26.599 --> 03:28.284
All right,
if you think it's gross, I won't.

03:28.308 --> 03:33.356
No, no. I don't think it's gross.
I think, like, I'm gross.

03:33.439 --> 03:36.734
I'm just, like, self-conscious
about my zits and stuff, so I feel...

03:36.817 --> 03:40.195
Are you kidding me? Popping pimples
is my favorite thing in life.

03:40.278 --> 03:43.782
- [inhales deeply] Okay.
- Thank you.

03:43.866 --> 03:45.868
- Go for it.
- Thank you so much.

03:45.951 --> 03:47.035
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

03:47.119 --> 03:49.204
- One... two...
- [inhales sharply]

03:50.205 --> 03:51.457
- Did you get it?
- Yes.

03:51.540 --> 03:52.541
[groans]

03:52.625 --> 03:53.667
- Look at it.
- Mmm-mmm.

03:53.751 --> 03:56.962
- Thank you for letting me be gross.
- You're welcome.

03:57.046 --> 04:00.382
You know, I can talk shit with anyone,
but popping someone's pimples...

04:01.384 --> 04:02.885
[dog barking]

04:03.636 --> 04:04.803
[Gus clicks tongue]

04:06.430 --> 04:09.350
[groans] I should probably
go walk those dogs.

04:09.433 --> 04:10.934
[Mickey] Who else lives around here?

04:11.018 --> 04:13.396
Any celebrities that haven't
been dead for 500 years?

04:13.479 --> 04:17.815
[chuckles] Uh... I think I heard
Matthew Perry lives around here.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.402
- Cool.
- Maybe. Yeah.

04:19.485 --> 04:24.823
[gasps] So that could mean that
that is Matthew Perry's personal trainer.

04:24.907 --> 04:25.908
[Gus] Oh, yeah.

04:25.991 --> 04:29.119
Oh, you know Matthew Perry
is in cooldown mode right now.

04:29.203 --> 04:31.121
[chuckles]

04:32.540 --> 04:35.208
All right.
Ooh, I think Gordon has to poopie.

04:35.292 --> 04:36.377
Oh, okay.

04:45.761 --> 04:48.764
It's kind of weird
seeing you smoke out here, you know?

04:49.682 --> 04:51.684
'Cause this neighborhood's so fancy.

04:51.767 --> 04:54.728
Feels like it's like
one big non-smoking section, you know?

04:56.063 --> 04:57.189
Okay.

04:57.898 --> 04:58.898
What?

05:00.108 --> 05:04.029
I don't know,
that just seemed a little, uh... judge-y.

05:04.113 --> 05:05.447
Do you hate that I smoke?

05:06.407 --> 05:10.077
- Why? Do you want me to hate it?
- Do I want you to hate it?

05:10.160 --> 05:15.499
Like, if it'd help you to quit,
knowing that I hated it or something.

05:16.333 --> 05:17.376
I mean, are you...

05:18.251 --> 05:20.879
Are you trying to quit or is that not...

05:20.963 --> 05:25.468
I just noticed you've been, like,
smoking more than you did before.

05:25.551 --> 05:28.345
I've been smoking more
because I'm in AA and SLAA,

05:28.429 --> 05:31.765
and I cannot give up anything else,
like, for the rest of my life.

05:31.849 --> 05:34.852
No. Totally, totally, totally.
I get it. Yeah.

05:36.019 --> 05:38.856
I wasn't trying to shame you
or whatever, you know.

05:38.939 --> 05:41.108
I know you're rockin' it.
I'm super proud of you.

05:44.069 --> 05:45.195
Okay.

05:46.279 --> 05:48.323
That a boy, Gordon.

05:51.869 --> 05:53.120
Hmm.

05:55.413 --> 05:57.934
I put the dogs in their special room,
so they're good for the night.

05:57.958 --> 06:00.878
Cool. Hmm. Lookin' at these photo albums,

06:00.961 --> 06:04.047
I feel like I know these people on, like,
a psychological level.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.841
Oh, yeah? Do tell.

06:06.425 --> 06:07.551
He hates his parents.

06:07.635 --> 06:09.469
- That's obvious.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:09.553 --> 06:11.948
They got married too young,
but they've got a great sex life.

06:11.972 --> 06:15.142
- I think that's 100% right.
- [both chuckle]

06:16.602 --> 06:19.647
[stammers] Are you wearing new pajamas?

06:20.606 --> 06:23.817
Uh, kind of. I got 'em from that drawer.

06:24.401 --> 06:25.986
You're wearing Linda's pajamas?

06:26.069 --> 06:29.197
Well, we're in Linda's house,
sleeping in Linda's bed.

06:29.281 --> 06:31.825
Might as well wear Linda's pajamas, right?

06:32.450 --> 06:34.703
Yeah, cool with me.

06:35.328 --> 06:37.414
How much do you think
a house like this is worth?

06:37.497 --> 06:40.292
Ooh, I don't know.
I'm bad with that stuff.

06:40.375 --> 06:44.087
- Maybe, like, $200.
- Hmm.

06:44.171 --> 06:47.049
- [chuckles]
- I think, like, five to seven million.

06:47.132 --> 06:51.303
- Probably. That's crazy, huh?
- Yeah.

06:53.972 --> 06:56.767
I've always wanted
to live in a house like this.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.852
It's the dream, to be honest.

07:00.145 --> 07:04.191
- Is that lame?
- No, it's not lame to have a dream.

07:04.274 --> 07:05.442
Dreams are good.

07:05.525 --> 07:09.487
Dreams make people, you know,
work hard to earn the things they want.

07:09.572 --> 07:11.448
I don't wanna earn it.
I just wanna have it.

07:11.532 --> 07:13.826
[chuckles] Yeah, but how would you buy it?

07:13.909 --> 07:15.828
Marry some rich dude.

07:15.911 --> 07:18.580
Some guy that's about to die
and gives me all his money.

07:19.081 --> 07:23.168
Don't you think that's a little...
anti-feminist?

07:23.251 --> 07:25.588
Shouldn't a woman want to go out
in the world and...

07:25.671 --> 07:28.090
not depend on some other guy for...

07:28.173 --> 07:31.509
Are you explaining feminism
to me right now? Is that what's happening?

07:31.594 --> 07:33.887
Never mind.
I'm not gonna say anything more.

07:33.971 --> 07:36.890
I just want to have a relaxed life.
Always have.

07:36.974 --> 07:41.103
Live in a big house, read some books
and have a cat. Is that so wrong?

07:41.729 --> 07:44.481
No. It's perfect.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.359
That's a perfect dream. I... I love that.

07:48.360 --> 07:51.947
[chuckles] But, honestly, how...
how often do you think that happens?

07:52.030 --> 07:53.824
Like, really happens?

07:54.407 --> 07:57.285
- Women marrying old men for money?
- Yeah.

07:58.621 --> 08:00.497
Every 15 seconds.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.207
No.

08:02.290 --> 08:05.168
Mmm. You think that Jerry Hall
married Rupert Murdoch

08:05.252 --> 08:06.419
because she loves him?

08:06.503 --> 08:08.421
Yeah, I believe she loves him.

08:09.006 --> 08:11.216
He's living on borrowed time
and she knows it.

08:11.299 --> 08:13.426
- He's probably a cool guy.
- Uh-huh.

08:13.510 --> 08:16.554
He's, like, smart, charming, witty.

08:17.264 --> 08:21.435
Okay, you're making
a pro-Rupert Murdoch argument right now.

08:22.019 --> 08:26.439
I'm just saying we should
give more credit to these wives.

08:27.190 --> 08:29.567
Like, did you see those pictures of them
on the wedding day?

08:29.652 --> 08:30.986
They looked very happy.

08:31.069 --> 08:34.239
I'd rather see the photos of them
on the wedding night.

08:34.740 --> 08:37.034
- That's when the work starts.
- Mnh-mnh.

08:37.116 --> 08:41.371
Jesus Lord. Choking down that dick?
Please, she earned every cent.

08:41.455 --> 08:42.455
You know...

08:43.081 --> 08:45.751
if Rupert Murdoch didn't exist,
there wouldn't be <i>The Simpsons.</i>

08:46.584 --> 08:47.961
I'm willing to live with that.

08:50.881 --> 08:51.882
Wow.

09:01.224 --> 09:04.853
- Do you mind if I watch TV?
- No, it'll help me fall asleep.

09:04.937 --> 09:08.857
Fucking awesome. Okay.
All right. Here we go. [grunts]

09:12.778 --> 09:14.487
[TV playing indistinctly]

09:26.750 --> 09:27.918
Fuck.

09:31.588 --> 09:32.589
Mickey!

09:33.256 --> 09:35.759
Hey, Mickey, can you come here?

09:35.843 --> 09:36.885
[Mickey] Sure!

09:37.678 --> 09:40.973
- What's up?
- Hey, uh, did you let one of the dogs in?

09:41.056 --> 09:43.851
Oh, yeah. I was bored,
so I let Peanut in to keep me company.

09:43.934 --> 09:45.728
Mmm, okay.

09:46.729 --> 09:50.398
'Cause you know we're supposed to
keep an eye on the dogs if they're inside.

09:50.482 --> 09:52.400
Remember, that's, like, one of the...
The rules?

09:52.484 --> 09:53.986
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

09:54.069 --> 09:56.321
Well, um, Peanut pooped in the house.

09:56.404 --> 09:58.031
[groans]

09:58.115 --> 10:00.784
- I'm sorry. Where?
- [stammers] Here.

10:00.868 --> 10:03.203
[groans] Okay, I'll clean it up.
It won't leave a stain.

10:03.286 --> 10:06.581
Not so much a stain
that I'm worried about, it's more, like...

10:06.664 --> 10:08.709
When a dog poops,
it's marking its territory.

10:08.792 --> 10:11.032
So now every time he poops,
he's gonna wanna poop here...

10:11.086 --> 10:13.171
Okay, can you not say poop?
Just say shit or...

10:13.255 --> 10:17.092
Okay. Poop. Shit. Fuck. Turds.
Whatever, okay? He took a shit,

10:17.175 --> 10:20.637
and it wouldn't have happened
if you had looked and paid attention.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.556
- I'm sorry.
- I'll clean it up.

10:23.640 --> 10:27.435
Just can you take the dogs outside
or something, please? For me.

10:27.519 --> 10:30.188
Yeah, I have to smoke anyway.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.691
Peanut! Gordon!

10:51.084 --> 10:52.210
[softly] Okay.

10:58.466 --> 10:59.592
[doorbell rings]

11:00.969 --> 11:02.012
- Hi!
- Hey!

11:02.095 --> 11:03.972
- [Mickey] Syd!
- Mickey!

11:05.223 --> 11:06.492
- [Jeff] Hey.
- [Mickey and Syd] Oh!

11:06.516 --> 11:08.435
- [Mickey] You remember Gus.
- [Syd] Hi, Gus.

11:08.518 --> 11:11.438
- This is Jeff, my husband.
- Hi, welcome!

11:11.521 --> 11:13.190
- Hey. [chuckles]
- [Gus chuckles]

11:13.273 --> 11:16.026
- Hi, welcome. [chuckles]
- Oh, hello.

11:16.734 --> 11:18.486
Ooh, sorry. [chuckles]

11:18.570 --> 11:21.198
[Syd] Oh, God.
Are we the first ones here?

11:21.281 --> 11:22.675
Please tell me we're not that lame.

11:22.699 --> 11:24.343
- [Mickey] You're the first ones here.
- Fuck.

11:24.367 --> 11:25.953
Hey, come on. Don't worry.

11:26.036 --> 11:29.081
You don't think I've been
in this position before? It's no problem.

11:29.164 --> 11:31.884
The babysitter showed up, so we're like,
"Hey, let's get outta here."

11:31.959 --> 11:34.878
And then, you know, Syd and I don't do
a lot of stuff at night,

11:34.962 --> 11:36.922
so we got excited.

11:37.005 --> 11:38.274
We bolted out of the fucking house.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.507
- Yeah.
- [Gus chuckles]

11:39.591 --> 11:41.301
Hey, Syd, come check out the backyard.

11:41.384 --> 11:42.760
- Yeah.
- [Mickey] Yeah.

11:42.845 --> 11:44.847
[Jeff and Gus chuckle]

11:44.930 --> 11:47.307
- Wow, this is cool.
- It is, isn't it?

11:47.390 --> 11:48.683
- Yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:50.477 --> 11:54.940
So I slam on my brakes going, like,
60 miles an hour.

11:55.023 --> 11:58.068
Otis is in the backseat
barfing up frozen yogurt...

11:58.151 --> 12:02.530
- Oh, my God.
- and I just miss rear-ending this guy.

12:02.614 --> 12:05.283
Ugh, I almost hit an office chair
on the freeway once,

12:05.367 --> 12:07.244
and it traumatized me for, like, a year.

12:09.246 --> 12:11.807
Are you gonna get in trouble with Jeff
if he sees you smoking that?

12:11.831 --> 12:14.376
No, he'll be cool with it.
He usually is when we go out.

12:14.459 --> 12:16.962
That way I can't judge him
for whatever he does.

12:17.045 --> 12:18.685
- Yeah.
- What about Gus? He cool with it?

12:19.089 --> 12:21.549
Oh, he asked me yesterday
if I ever thought about quitting.

12:21.633 --> 12:24.136
- You didn't like that.
- I mean, I like Gus.

12:24.219 --> 12:27.890
I like him, but sometimes I feel like
I'm his fixer-upper or something.

12:27.973 --> 12:29.516
- Yeah?
- I don't know.

12:30.100 --> 12:31.820
We went to lunch with my dad
the other week,

12:31.894 --> 12:33.371
and he was really nice and supportive,

12:33.395 --> 12:38.691
but it also felt like he was getting off
on watching me be damaged, too, you know?

12:38.775 --> 12:43.947
Or, just devil's advocating here,
maybe he really is supportive and caring.

12:44.031 --> 12:48.911
But he's kinda condescending about it,
you know? It's the way he does it.

12:49.577 --> 12:53.916
And I know if I ever messed up,
he would be so disappointed in me.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.169
[stammers] It's too much pressure.

12:57.252 --> 12:59.796
I wouldn't worry about it.
I think you're just feeling this way

12:59.879 --> 13:02.424
because you guys have been cooped up
in this house together.

13:02.507 --> 13:05.177
If he goes, "I'm proud of you,"
one more time,

13:05.260 --> 13:06.928
I'm gonna slit his fucking throat.

13:08.805 --> 13:10.307
[Jeff] So, you guys know Mickey?

13:10.390 --> 13:11.766
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

13:11.850 --> 13:12.934
Great. How do you know her?

13:13.643 --> 13:15.895
- I work with her at the radio station.
- Oh, cool.

13:17.022 --> 13:18.065
How about you?

13:18.148 --> 13:19.899
Yeah, I work at the radio station, too.

13:19.983 --> 13:21.276
Oh, so you're coworkers?

13:21.359 --> 13:24.362
He doesn't work
at the radio station. [chuckling]

13:24.446 --> 13:26.614
- Nah, I was just being an asshole.
- Oh.

13:26.698 --> 13:28.951
- I don't even fucking know this guy.
- [all laugh]

13:29.034 --> 13:31.262
- I don't know him either, no.
- Are you guys fucking with me?

13:31.286 --> 13:32.287
[both] No.

13:32.370 --> 13:33.997
- Oh, wow.
- What's your name again?

13:34.081 --> 13:35.958
- Len.
- Truman. Nice to meet you.

13:36.041 --> 13:37.084
Nice to meet you.

13:37.167 --> 13:39.169
So what about you?
Uh, you've been dating anybody?

13:39.252 --> 13:42.464
Nah. Do you know what's crazy, dude?
I've been hooking up with an ex.

13:42.547 --> 13:45.300
Ever since <i>Witchita</i> ended,
I need something stable in my life.

13:45.383 --> 13:48.595
- Oh, totally. I hear that. Yeah.
- Yeah, so what about you?

13:48.678 --> 13:50.949
Is Mickey staying with you this whole time
you've been in this dump?

13:50.973 --> 13:54.392
Yeah, she was here, uh, last night
and then tonight and tomorrow night.

13:54.476 --> 13:55.602
- Three nights?
- Mmm-hmm.

13:55.685 --> 13:58.063
Three nights? That's what happens
when you're not working.

13:58.146 --> 13:59.786
You fill up your free time
with your dick.

14:00.357 --> 14:03.901
No, it's okay, 'cause, you know,
I'm going out of town pretty soon

14:03.986 --> 14:05.695
- to do that movie with Arya.
- Uh-huh.

14:05.778 --> 14:08.156
So, just trying to get in
some quality time before I go.

14:08.240 --> 14:09.241
Slow down, slow down.

14:09.324 --> 14:11.044
How long have you been talking
to this girl?

14:11.743 --> 14:14.246
I don't know, like, a month...
A little over a month.

14:14.329 --> 14:16.164
Yeah, dude, a little over a month

14:16.248 --> 14:18.017
but you're treating it
like it's been two years.

14:18.041 --> 14:19.917
Relax, bro. Relax.

14:20.002 --> 14:24.131
I'm pretty sure Mickey's a nice girl,
but she seems a bit... complex.

14:24.214 --> 14:27.259
See, that's what I like about her,
that she is complex, you know?

14:27.342 --> 14:29.927
It's like every day,
I learn a little bit more about her,

14:30.012 --> 14:33.723
and I think I start to understand her,
then she does something that just, like...

14:34.807 --> 14:38.228
I don't know. I love it.
She's like a puzzle, and I love puzzles.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.106
I like a nice 24-piece puzzle.

14:41.189 --> 14:43.816
- Mickey's like a 500-piece puzzle.
- Well...

14:44.734 --> 14:46.987
Anyway, I'm glad you're here.

14:47.070 --> 14:49.132
We get to celebrate the end
of <i>Witchita</i> together, huh?

14:49.156 --> 14:52.117
- Yes, yes, yes. RIP <i>Witchita,</i> man.
- Yes.

14:53.118 --> 14:55.370
Hey, buddy,
I'm so sorry about that tattoo.

14:55.453 --> 14:57.747
Dude, I'm not there yet.

15:02.252 --> 15:04.004
[indistinct chatter]

15:13.388 --> 15:14.764
So you two are Mickey's friends?

15:14.847 --> 15:17.059
Uh, yeah.
I've known Mickey since forever.

15:17.142 --> 15:18.726
[Chris] Cool.

15:18.810 --> 15:20.610
What about you guys?
Are you Mickey's friends?

15:20.645 --> 15:22.814
- We're Gus' friends.
- I'm his best friend.

15:22.897 --> 15:26.234
I only ask because
I never know who Mickey's friends are.

15:26.318 --> 15:28.153
Seems like
she's always making new friends.

15:28.236 --> 15:29.797
Why do you say that like it's a bad thing?

15:29.821 --> 15:32.699
Well, I think people get to know
Mickey's bullshit,

15:32.782 --> 15:35.243
- and she has to make new friends.
- Where is she, anyways?

15:35.327 --> 15:36.911
Like, I feel like I never see her.

15:36.995 --> 15:40.582
Let me guess.
Upstairs, fucking some random dude.

15:40.665 --> 15:42.959
[Shaun] Okay, shut up.
You're done talking now.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.294
- I'm done talking now.
- Yeah.

15:44.377 --> 15:47.714
Like, I've been in two fights
in my lifetime.

15:48.798 --> 15:49.841
What about you, man?

15:49.924 --> 15:52.969
Me? None. Uh, never. I've never... fight.

15:53.886 --> 15:54.887
What about you, Stretch?

15:56.139 --> 15:58.891
- [clicks tongue] About a dozen.
- What?

15:59.559 --> 16:02.019
When I see injustice, I fight.

16:02.104 --> 16:04.314
- Did you say your name was Alexis?
- Yeah.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.566
You look super familiar.
Are you on Tinder?

16:06.649 --> 16:07.734
Maybe.

16:07.817 --> 16:09.527
Jesus. What the hell am I doing here?

16:10.570 --> 16:13.198
Da-da-da-dah. Ooh!

16:13.281 --> 16:15.908
Oh, you look good.

16:15.992 --> 16:18.661
Thank you.
This Linda woman has good taste.

16:18.745 --> 16:19.745
Yeah.

16:20.330 --> 16:23.625
So, hey, um,
did you invite Randy tonight or...

16:23.708 --> 16:27.629
- Uh, no. I assumed you'd tell him.
- Okay, gotcha.

16:27.712 --> 16:32.050
- Did you? Did you tell him?
- [chuckles] Uh, no. But that's okay.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.801
Okay.

16:34.969 --> 16:37.305
So do you think
Gus could have maybe invited him?

16:37.930 --> 16:42.394
- I don't know. Why? What's going on?
- Nothing. It's just...

16:42.477 --> 16:45.397
I guess things have been a little bit
strained between Randy and I lately,

16:45.438 --> 16:48.233
so... if he doesn't come tonight,
that's okay.

16:48.316 --> 16:50.902
- Okay.
- But I love all these jewels.

16:50.985 --> 16:56.449
I feel so regal, like the kind of woman
who's probably great at dinner parties,

16:56.533 --> 16:58.243
but is a bit racist.

16:58.827 --> 17:01.246
- What time is it?
- Oh, just after 8:30.

17:01.329 --> 17:03.999
Oh, I gotta get everybody
gathered around the TV for <i>Witchita.</i>

17:04.582 --> 17:07.669
You ready for some <i>Witchita,</i>
motherfuckers?

17:07.752 --> 17:09.086
[all cheering]

17:11.964 --> 17:16.051
Yeah, and keep it going
for the man of the hour, Gus Cruikshank!

17:16.136 --> 17:18.221
[all cheering]

17:18.305 --> 17:19.722
Thank you. Thank you.

17:19.806 --> 17:23.309
All right, DVR-ed
for zero commercial interruption.

17:23.393 --> 17:24.269
Five...

17:24.352 --> 17:28.147
[all] Four, three, two, one...

17:28.231 --> 17:29.982
[all cheering]

17:30.983 --> 17:32.985
<i>[Witchita</i> theme music playing on TV]

17:41.035 --> 17:42.870
[church bell tolling on TV]

17:42.954 --> 17:45.372
[Elise] <i>It really is a beautiful steeple,
Reverend.</i>

17:45.457 --> 17:48.126
- [Pastor Lewis] <i>Hmm. Yes.</i>
- [all cheering]

17:49.961 --> 17:52.880
- [Mickey chuckles] "Story by"!
- [Gus] Yeah. Wow, wow, wow.

17:52.964 --> 17:55.967
<i>You know,
you should join me here this evening.</i>

17:56.050 --> 17:58.302
<i>Oh, uh, of course, Reverend.</i>

17:58.386 --> 18:03.057
Yeah, Heidi. Go hook up with Pastor Lewis
and stay off of Gus' dick.

18:03.140 --> 18:06.353
- [Chris laughs]
- Ha. Very funny, very funny.

18:06.436 --> 18:08.980
Yeah, Heidi.
Why don't you stay off Gus' dick?

18:09.063 --> 18:10.064
[chuckles]

18:10.147 --> 18:13.860
[laughing nervously] Oh, boy.

18:13.943 --> 18:15.570
[Elise] <i>It's just that my mother died...</i>

18:15.653 --> 18:18.281
- [softly] Why'd you say that?
- [whispers] It's a joke.

18:18.365 --> 18:21.243
Yeah. No, that's... that's funny.

18:21.326 --> 18:23.370
[Chris] Is she a witch? Gus.

18:23.453 --> 18:26.080
- What?
- Who is witches? Like, is...

18:26.163 --> 18:28.291
- She is? She's a witch?
- Yeah, they're all...

18:28.375 --> 18:30.167
- Most of them are witches.
- Oh, okay.

18:30.252 --> 18:31.837
- <i>Witchita.</i>
- [chuckles]

18:31.919 --> 18:33.963
- Do you get it? Yeah.
- [laughing] Yeah.

18:34.047 --> 18:35.548
Hello? Mickey?

18:36.591 --> 18:38.468
- Oh, my God, Andy. Sorry.
- [Andy] Echo!

18:38.551 --> 18:40.970
[Mickey] All right. Sorry. Hi!

18:41.053 --> 18:43.180
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi. Good.

18:43.265 --> 18:46.100
- Sorry, you guys.
- Uh, this is my friend, Andy.

18:47.018 --> 18:48.728
It's Andy Dick, obviously.

18:48.811 --> 18:51.356
- [woman] Hi.
- Uh, spoiler alert,

18:51.439 --> 18:54.609
Colonel Mustard is giving it
to Miss Scarlet up in the conservatory

18:54.692 --> 18:56.694
with the candlestick right now. [chuckles]

18:57.529 --> 18:59.614
- What's going on?
- Listen, can I talk to you?

18:59.697 --> 19:01.157
- Yeah.
- In private.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.867
- What's up?
- AA stuff.

19:02.950 --> 19:04.911
- [whispers indistinctly]
- Yep. Yeah.

19:04.994 --> 19:06.496
Sorry. Enjoy.

19:07.414 --> 19:11.418
Um... I just gotta go talk to Andy
about some AA stuff,

19:11.501 --> 19:15.212
so do you want to pause the episode
or is that, like, annoying for people?

19:15.297 --> 19:17.632
Uh, yeah,
I guess we'll just keep it running

19:17.715 --> 19:19.509
but come back as soon as you can.

19:19.592 --> 19:20.802
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:20.885 --> 19:24.346
[giggles] <i>I bet you can see
the whole town from up here.</i>

19:24.431 --> 19:27.142
<i>Oh, look, there's Jarvis. Jarvis!</i>

19:27.725 --> 19:30.437
I had the, um, initial audition...

19:30.520 --> 19:32.647
- Uh-huh.
- and I fuckin' killed it.

19:32.730 --> 19:36.067
I really did.
Even I was like, "Fuck," you know.

19:36.150 --> 19:40.655
Because I've been saying no to all...
About five auditions all year.

19:40.738 --> 19:42.740
- Because they're triggers for me.
- Yeah.

19:42.824 --> 19:45.702
They're triggers.
I... I used to drink...

19:47.078 --> 19:49.080
before I would audition and, um...

19:49.163 --> 19:52.249
When's the last time
you went in sober to an audition?

19:52.959 --> 19:54.210
Nineteen...

19:56.045 --> 19:57.088
Never.

19:57.171 --> 20:00.132
<i>I just feel like
death follows me wherever I go.</i>

20:00.216 --> 20:02.844
<i>All of these murders in town,
it's giving me a fright.</i>

20:02.927 --> 20:04.303
[Pastor Lewis] <i>My dear. My dear.</i>

20:04.387 --> 20:05.471
<i>Now is the time...</i>

20:06.306 --> 20:09.309
- <i>to hold our friends very close.</i>
- [cell phone vibrating]

20:10.560 --> 20:14.481
<i>You know, you never really know
who to trust these days.</i>

20:22.489 --> 20:23.823
What the fuck, Bertie?

20:23.906 --> 20:28.327
Why are you texting me, "I'm outside"?
Just come inside. We're watching <i>Witchita.</i>

20:28.411 --> 20:31.247
I'm not going in because you obviously
don't want me to be in there.

20:31.331 --> 20:33.500
No, I just... I'm sorry, I forgot.

20:33.583 --> 20:36.520
Gus texted me, "Why aren't you here?"
I had no idea what he was talking about.

20:36.544 --> 20:38.880
I had to ask him, like some sort of loser.

20:38.963 --> 20:43.050
Like, my girlfriend and all my friends
are watching TV in a big mansion,

20:43.134 --> 20:44.802
and I'm not invited to come in?

20:45.387 --> 20:48.431
[sighs] It just made me feel really sad.

20:48.515 --> 20:50.850
And I feel like
you're being weird to me and...

20:50.933 --> 20:54.145
No, I'm not. It's just...
Just come inside.

20:54.771 --> 20:56.439
I... I missed you.

20:56.523 --> 20:57.940
Aw...

20:58.024 --> 20:59.526
I missed you, too.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.905
Do you think they noticed I wasn't here?

21:03.988 --> 21:06.115
Should we say I had,
like, a flat tire or something?

21:06.198 --> 21:07.867
No. No one cares. It's fine.

21:08.743 --> 21:12.038
I mean, now, he's, like,
so into my sobriety

21:12.121 --> 21:13.641
that it's kind of borderline creepy...

21:13.665 --> 21:16.145
- Oh, God, I hate that.
- Right? He's, like, trying to, like...

21:16.208 --> 21:17.752
Well, welcome to my world.

21:17.835 --> 21:19.355
- Well...
- The whole world's into my sobriety.

21:19.379 --> 21:20.939
I know.
I can't even imagine what that feels like.

21:20.963 --> 21:22.048
Can't stand it.

21:22.131 --> 21:24.258
So now he's, like, keeping track of me.

21:24.341 --> 21:26.302
I feel like he's got a chart
in his apartment

21:26.386 --> 21:28.805
where it's like,
"number of meetings per week."

21:28.888 --> 21:31.015
I'm... I'm barely exaggerating.

21:31.599 --> 21:33.351
Oh, yeah, but you know what?

21:34.268 --> 21:35.937
God, I wish I had something like that.

21:39.231 --> 21:40.692
- No, Andy.
- What?

21:40.775 --> 21:44.946
- No, we're never gonna make out.
- Don't... Please don't say "never."

21:45.029 --> 21:49.283
[Pastor Lewis] <i>Oh, no, no, Detective.
I've never seen anything like it either.</i>

21:49.366 --> 21:51.743
<i>Hmm. Uh, let's see, well, Wednesdays?</i>

21:51.828 --> 21:53.871
<i>Wednesdays, we minister to the poor...</i>

21:53.955 --> 21:56.416
- [whispering] Are you farting?
- [whispering] No.

21:56.499 --> 22:00.086
Yes, you are.
I can smell it, Jeff. It's disgusting.

22:00.169 --> 22:02.338
Well, if you know it's me, why do you ask?

22:03.005 --> 22:04.424
[sighs]

22:04.507 --> 22:07.052
[Pastor Lewis] <i>Her memory's
a little spotty these days</i>

22:07.134 --> 22:08.970
<i>due to her advanced age and all.</i>

22:09.053 --> 22:12.974
<i>But, uh, I'm sure she'll vouch for me
and verify my whereabouts.</i> [chuckles]

22:13.057 --> 22:15.226
Hey. Hey, Len.

22:15.977 --> 22:17.579
Can you take the glass of wine
off the floor?

22:17.603 --> 22:20.440
- I just... I don't want it to spill.
- Yeah, no problem.

22:21.858 --> 22:23.651
[Elise] <i>They really are stunning at night.</i>

22:23.735 --> 22:25.027
Okay, thanks.

22:25.111 --> 22:27.780
[Pastor Lewis] <i>Yes, it is lovely, my dear.</i>

22:28.948 --> 22:32.619
- <i>Say good night... forever!</i>
- [Elise screams]

22:32.702 --> 22:33.703
[thud]

22:33.786 --> 22:35.997
<i>Oh, my God. That lady fell.</i>

22:36.664 --> 22:38.958
- <i>Someone get help!</i>
- [all chuckling]

22:43.505 --> 22:44.506
Fuck.

22:45.089 --> 22:48.384
[stammering] Um, Gus, sorry.
I think one of the dogs ate chocolate.

22:48.467 --> 22:49.761
They're acting all sick.

22:49.844 --> 22:51.554
They're barfing. They're gonna barf more.

22:51.638 --> 22:54.265
Are you serious? Did somebody
open the door to the dog room?

22:54.348 --> 22:55.808
- [bottle clatters]
- God...

22:55.892 --> 22:57.434
- [Len] Sorry.
- Fuck!

22:57.519 --> 23:00.605
- Hey, it's okay, buddy. We'll clean up.
- [Gus] It's okay. Uh...

23:00.688 --> 23:01.981
I'm gonna take care of this.

23:02.857 --> 23:05.693
- Where they at? Is it Gordon?
- I don't know. They look the same.

23:06.277 --> 23:09.405
Do we have to keep watching?
'Cause it's... I can't.

23:09.488 --> 23:11.699
We have to go, actually,
'cause we have a sitter.

23:11.783 --> 23:13.535
- Okay, guys.
- [indistinct chatter]

23:13.618 --> 23:15.036
[Shaun] Nice to see you. Bye.

23:15.119 --> 23:17.204
Bye. So good to see you guys.

23:24.336 --> 23:26.896
- [Andy speaking indistinctly]
- [Mickey] Okay. Call me tomorrow.

23:26.964 --> 23:30.217
Okay. And... and thanks.
Probably call you tonight.

23:30.301 --> 23:32.303
- Okay. Bye.
- Okay. Thank you.

23:32.386 --> 23:34.013
[door opens and closes]

23:34.096 --> 23:35.682
Oh, did everybody leave?

23:36.307 --> 23:38.434
Yeah.
Well, you were up there a long time.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.352
- So...
- Oh. Yeah.

23:41.103 --> 23:45.191
Gordon ate some chocolate, but I helped
him puke it up, so he's okay now.

23:45.274 --> 23:46.525
All right.

23:46.609 --> 23:50.112
So, why are you cleaning now?
Just leave it for tomorrow.

23:50.196 --> 23:54.533
- Because I want to clean up now.
- Wow, you're so anal.

23:54.617 --> 23:57.954
Mickey, if I wanna clean up,
I can clean up. All right?

23:58.913 --> 24:02.416
God forbid I have respect
for other people's stuff, right?

24:04.043 --> 24:05.502
Wow.

24:05.587 --> 24:07.254
Is this what you're like?

24:08.422 --> 24:10.025
If we lived together,
would you be like this?

24:10.049 --> 24:12.844
Like, get all wound up
when things are messy?

24:12.927 --> 24:15.263
Why are you picking a fight
with me right now?

24:15.763 --> 24:18.057
- You should be the one who's apologizing.
- For what?

24:18.140 --> 24:19.516
For missing my episode!

24:19.601 --> 24:21.227
Like, ten minutes in, you just stand up

24:21.310 --> 24:23.730
and, like, walk out of the room
and don't see any of it.

24:23.813 --> 24:25.213
Yeah, 'cause I had to talk to Andy.

24:25.272 --> 24:28.651
Okay, first of all...
you're friends with Andy Dick?

24:28.735 --> 24:32.113
What the fuck?
And then, second of all...

24:32.196 --> 24:35.532
I guess Andy Dick is more important
than my episode of <i>Witchita,</i> huh?

24:35.617 --> 24:38.202
He had to talk to me
about some deeply personal shit

24:38.285 --> 24:40.246
and he needed to talk
to someone in the program

24:40.329 --> 24:42.539
and that is way more important

24:42.624 --> 24:44.416
than your stupid
little episode of television

24:44.500 --> 24:46.711
that you just want
everybody to suck your dick about.

24:46.794 --> 24:48.671
Wow. You are jealous.

24:48.755 --> 24:50.547
It's like you couldn't even
be there for me

24:50.632 --> 24:51.984
when something good was happening.

24:52.008 --> 24:55.011
What was good?
Are you talking about <i>Witchita?</i>

24:55.094 --> 24:57.805
- That show fucking sucks.
- Okay, don't say that.

24:57.889 --> 24:59.265
You say that all the time!

24:59.348 --> 25:02.101
Yeah, I can say it, but you can't.
Just support me!

25:02.184 --> 25:05.271
Oh, so lie to you now?
Okay, it was great.

25:05.354 --> 25:07.481
All right, yeah.
Whatever, Mickey. Fine.

25:07.564 --> 25:10.818
I'm an asshole because I wanted
you to watch my show with me, okay?

25:11.778 --> 25:16.282
Ugh, [sighs] just... Okay, just...
Please just stop monitoring me, okay?

25:16.365 --> 25:18.242
- What?
- You monitor me all the time!

25:18.325 --> 25:20.202
I do not monitor you.

25:20.286 --> 25:22.538
You suffocate me.
I have no personal space.

25:22.621 --> 25:25.207
You're, like, keeping tallies
on me all the time.

25:25.291 --> 25:28.085
Like, four meetings this week,
three meetings last week,

25:28.169 --> 25:30.046
and you're fucking, like,
checking up on me.

25:30.129 --> 25:33.465
You know what?
Why don't you go find some rich old guy,

25:33.549 --> 25:35.551
- and you can be his kept woman...
- [scoffs]

25:35.634 --> 25:38.095
and he can fucking ignore you,
which is what you want.

25:38.179 --> 25:39.657
You don't want anybody caring about you,

25:39.681 --> 25:41.849
you don't want anybody
looking out for you.

25:41.933 --> 25:43.827
You wanted to be treated
like dirt and be ignored,

25:43.851 --> 25:45.477
'cause that's what you're familiar with.

25:45.561 --> 25:48.147
And then somebody comes along
and treats you kindly,

25:48.230 --> 25:50.482
and you don't know
how to fucking process it!

25:50.566 --> 25:53.695
Wow. That's nice.
That's real fucking rude of you.

25:53.778 --> 25:56.405
- Where are my cigarettes? Where...
- Why would I know?

25:56.488 --> 25:59.784
- Did you fucking hide my cigarettes?
- Oh, my God.

25:59.867 --> 26:03.662
Yes, Mickey, I took your cigarettes
and I hid them from you. You got me.

26:03.746 --> 26:05.974
You act like it's a joke,
but I wouldn't put it past you.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.267
I'm sure that's something
you'd love to do.

26:07.291 --> 26:09.210
You're accusing me of hiding cigarettes?

26:09.293 --> 26:12.338
- You keep tabs on me...
- That's so fucking bonkers!

26:12.421 --> 26:14.965
You wanna fucking monitor me?
Fine, watch this. Monitor this.

26:16.258 --> 26:17.969
Jesus Christ!

26:37.613 --> 26:38.906
[sighs]

26:49.041 --> 26:50.209
[sighs]

26:56.340 --> 26:57.884
[water running]

27:00.052 --> 27:01.428
Hey, Gus.

27:01.512 --> 27:03.514
Oh. Hey.

27:03.597 --> 27:04.598
Hey, what's up, man?

27:04.681 --> 27:07.476
Uh, I hope you don't mind,
I crashed here last night.

27:07.559 --> 27:09.771
Oh! That's okay. It's cool.

27:09.854 --> 27:11.773
I'm getting ready
to get out of here right now.

27:11.856 --> 27:13.107
- Good morning.
- Good...

27:14.066 --> 27:16.235
- [Alexis] Hey.
- Hey, how's everything?

27:16.318 --> 27:17.319
Can I get a ride?

27:17.403 --> 27:19.864
- Where you... Where you headed?
- Westside.

27:20.364 --> 27:22.199
Damn, I live in North Hollywood.

27:23.367 --> 27:25.744
- So?
- You know what, I...

27:25.828 --> 27:27.454
We'll figure this out outside, man.

27:27.538 --> 27:30.082
Crazy party once again.
Uh, I'll see you, bro.

27:30.166 --> 27:31.292
All right. Bye.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.920
- Great <i>Witchita.</i>
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

27:37.298 --> 27:38.299
[door closes]

27:44.638 --> 27:45.973
[footsteps approaching]

27:51.520 --> 27:53.689
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:56.067 --> 27:59.153
- What's up? Are you taking off?
- Yeah.

27:59.236 --> 28:00.876
I figured, let you take care of the house

28:00.947 --> 28:02.698
- for the last night.
- Oh.

28:03.699 --> 28:04.951
Okay.

28:07.036 --> 28:11.040
- Hey, I'm sorry about last night.
- No, I'm sorry.

28:11.123 --> 28:14.626
We were getting along
and then I started acting out and...

28:14.710 --> 28:17.171
[sighs] I don't know.

28:17.254 --> 28:19.006
Well, let's leave together. Huh?

28:19.090 --> 28:21.258
I'll just pack my stuff up
and we can take off and...

28:21.342 --> 28:22.634
Stay here.

28:22.718 --> 28:25.804
We can have lunch tomorrow.
Enjoy the house, you know.

28:25.888 --> 28:29.684
Watch a movie on the big TV.
<i>Avatar</i> or something.

28:30.767 --> 28:32.144
Okay.

28:32.228 --> 28:35.564
So, uh, yeah, we'll just...
We'll talk tomorrow.

28:35.648 --> 28:36.648
Yeah.

28:37.900 --> 28:39.110
Okay.

28:41.445 --> 28:43.280
Um... [sighs]

28:43.364 --> 28:46.826
I'm sorry about the crystal bowl.
I'll buy a new one.

28:47.993 --> 28:50.579
Yeah. I looked online and...

28:51.372 --> 28:54.625
- one of those costs $2,000.
- Oh.

28:55.542 --> 28:58.045
Okay. In that case...

28:58.129 --> 29:00.339
maybe we could pretend
like nothing happened

29:00.422 --> 29:02.091
and see if anyone notices?

29:02.758 --> 29:05.177
That's my whole philosophy
in life. [chuckles]

29:06.262 --> 29:08.014
- [inhales deeply] Okay.
- Okay.

29:08.973 --> 29:11.642
Right. [sighs]
