WEBVTT

00:02.814 --> 00:05.893
Lilly and Miles, carrots and broccoli.

00:05.894 --> 00:07.580
How great is that?

00:07.582 --> 00:09.816
- Brocky's yucky, daddy.
- What?

00:09.817 --> 00:12.701
No, no, no. Brocky's awesome.

00:12.702 --> 00:14.036
Where are the hot dogs?

00:14.037 --> 00:16.872
That is a great question, Lily.

00:16.873 --> 00:18.941
Where is the...

00:18.942 --> 00:20.442
Oh!

00:20.443 --> 00:21.710
...the hot dog?

00:21.711 --> 00:23.712
- Oh!
- How did you make that happen?

00:23.713 --> 00:25.080
Oh, no. What about you, Miles?

00:25.081 --> 00:26.014
Is there something there?

00:26.015 --> 00:27.850
When did your ears get so hungry?

00:27.851 --> 00:29.985
- (laughing)
- How'd you do that?

00:29.986 --> 00:31.954
Come on. Hey...

00:31.955 --> 00:33.722
Right.

00:33.723 --> 00:34.884
- LILY: Let's eat.
- AIDEN: Let's eat.

00:34.885 --> 00:37.566
- What do we have to do first?
- Prayer.

00:37.567 --> 00:37.593
Yes.

00:37.594 --> 00:39.061
(kids talking over each other)

00:39.062 --> 00:40.329
Come on. Who's gonna say the blessing?

00:40.330 --> 00:43.899
- I will!
- Okay, let's go.

00:43.900 --> 00:45.133
Father, in the name of Jesus,

00:45.134 --> 00:47.736
we pray for this... food. (laughs)

00:47.737 --> 00:50.072
- Amen.
- Amen. Amen.

00:50.073 --> 00:51.340
AIDEN: Amen, let's eat.

00:51.341 --> 00:52.341
MILES: Amen, let's eat!

00:52.342 --> 00:54.775

01:04.352 --> 01:07.589
WOMAN: <i>What about your old CIA friend</i>

01:07.590 --> 01:09.691
<i>you mentioned last week?</i>

01:09.692 --> 01:12.761
I believe we're calling her Jane.

01:12.762 --> 01:15.297
ELIZABETH: Nothing's changed.

01:15.298 --> 01:17.099
There's a negotiation

01:17.100 --> 01:20.434
to bring her into custody
that's ongoing, so...

01:22.905 --> 01:25.107
Oh, you want to know
how I feel about it.

01:25.108 --> 01:26.475
(laughs)

01:26.476 --> 01:28.710
Mmm. Only six sessions in,

01:28.711 --> 01:31.613
I'm already a broken record...
and a cliché.

01:31.614 --> 01:35.683
Shouldn't we be talking
about my PTSD triggers?

01:38.654 --> 01:41.690
Mostly, overwhelming loss.

01:41.691 --> 01:43.191
I think I mentioned

01:43.192 --> 01:46.028
that we started at the
Company the same week.

01:46.029 --> 01:47.829
Over 20 years ago.

01:47.830 --> 01:50.766
She's family.

01:50.767 --> 01:52.433
Or was.

01:56.104 --> 01:57.873
I just can't believe I missed it.

01:57.874 --> 01:59.875
You mean her betrayal?

01:59.876 --> 02:03.512
My job is to understand people.

02:03.513 --> 02:06.581
Judge what they're capable of.

02:06.582 --> 02:07.950
My old job.

02:07.951 --> 02:09.184
Part of it.

02:09.185 --> 02:11.586
So you let yourself down?

02:11.587 --> 02:12.955
And my country.

02:12.956 --> 02:16.825
Have you thought about
what you would say to Jane

02:16.826 --> 02:18.327
if you had the chance?

02:18.328 --> 02:20.095
Oh, yes.

02:20.096 --> 02:23.999
We have had many imaginary conversations

02:24.000 --> 02:25.701
that go on for hours.

02:25.702 --> 02:28.035
(laughs)

02:29.538 --> 02:33.007
Mostly about... why.

02:34.443 --> 02:35.744
Why she did it.

02:35.745 --> 02:38.180
"It" being classified.

02:38.181 --> 02:40.080
Highly.

02:45.754 --> 02:49.091
She didn't just betray
me and her country.

02:49.092 --> 02:52.761
She hurt...

02:52.762 --> 02:56.765
one of our friends.

02:56.766 --> 02:59.333
Horribly.

03:01.870 --> 03:04.106
That-that's the...

03:04.107 --> 03:09.410
the part that I just can't reconcile with.

03:18.086 --> 03:19.453
(sniffs)

03:23.658 --> 03:24.993
Can I ask you something?

03:24.994 --> 03:26.094
Anything.

03:26.095 --> 03:29.297
Is Russell Jackson a crier?

03:29.298 --> 03:31.800
- (laughs)
- I mean, I know he is.

03:31.801 --> 03:33.001
He is, right?

03:33.002 --> 03:35.137
That gnarly exterior.

03:35.138 --> 03:37.506
Then he comes in here and just...

03:37.507 --> 03:39.974
(laughing): ...loses it.

03:44.013 --> 03:46.915
Just get me the loan docs by tomorrow,

03:46.916 --> 03:48.849
and we'll be good to go.

03:52.921 --> 03:55.157
Act natural, Mr. Humphrey.

03:55.158 --> 03:57.358
I need to get back to work.

03:58.827 --> 04:00.395
WOMAN: <i>Have you had any contact</i>

04:00.396 --> 04:02.230
with your ex-wife in the last two months?

04:02.231 --> 04:03.498
No.

04:03.499 --> 04:05.634
- Do you have any knowledge
of her whereabouts? - No.

04:05.635 --> 04:07.069
Do you know anyone

04:07.070 --> 04:08.570
who might have knowledge
of her whereabouts?

04:08.571 --> 04:11.406
No. Come on, I tell you the
same thing every week.

04:11.407 --> 04:12.707
Nothing's changed.

04:12.708 --> 04:14.309
- What the hell is going on?
- I'll ask the questions,

04:14.310 --> 04:16.144
Mr. Humphrey.

04:16.144 --> 04:20.281
It's our little girl's birthday tomorrow.

04:20.283 --> 04:23.018
What am I supposed to
tell her about her mom?

04:23.019 --> 04:24.152
That's not my concern.

04:24.153 --> 04:25.117
But I'll remind you

04:25.118 --> 04:26.955
that if you ever tell
anyone about our meetings,

04:26.956 --> 04:28.723
you'll face ten years in federal prison

04:28.724 --> 04:30.225
under Title 18, Section...

04:30.226 --> 04:32.127
Can you at least tell me, is
she in danger or trouble...?

04:32.128 --> 04:34.395
Thank you for your time, Mr. Humphrey.

04:40.635 --> 04:42.537
This is beyond mortifying.

04:42.538 --> 04:44.473
Come on. Mom doesn't want
to completely miss out

04:44.474 --> 04:46.408
on your driver's education, Noodle.

04:46.409 --> 04:47.676
What he said.

04:47.677 --> 04:49.211
News flash: There isn't going to be

04:49.212 --> 04:50.545
a motorcade on my driving test.

04:50.546 --> 04:52.514
Well, it's D.C. You never know.

04:52.515 --> 04:53.715
It's not a big deal.

04:53.716 --> 04:55.517
Yeah, until someone tweets
a photo of me motorcading.

04:55.518 --> 04:57.185
You cannot just have a fighter pilot

04:57.186 --> 04:58.286
teaching you how to drive.

04:58.287 --> 05:00.021
- (phone ringing)
- Our life is so weird.

05:00.022 --> 05:01.456
And yet we make it work.

05:01.457 --> 05:03.925
Get in the car, will you?

05:03.926 --> 05:05.526
Hello.

05:07.362 --> 05:09.596
Yeah. Okay.

05:11.066 --> 05:12.601
Wipe that smirk

05:12.602 --> 05:13.768
off your face.

05:13.769 --> 05:14.736
I have to go in.

05:14.737 --> 05:16.037
Country first.

05:16.038 --> 05:17.172
Drive safe.

05:17.173 --> 05:18.974
- Is everything okay?
- I don't know.

05:18.975 --> 05:21.809
The president wants me
in the Situation Room.

05:23.111 --> 05:24.045
We'll see.

05:24.046 --> 05:26.248
- You be safe.
- I'll try.

05:26.249 --> 05:28.216
Wish me luck.

05:28.217 --> 05:29.518
Change of plans.

05:29.519 --> 05:32.120
ELIZABETH: <i>Russell, what's going on?</i>

05:32.121 --> 05:34.523
We found Juliet.

05:34.524 --> 05:35.857
She agreed to a deal?

05:35.858 --> 05:36.858
No.

05:36.859 --> 05:38.527
NSA got a ping on her location.

05:38.528 --> 05:39.494
How?

05:39.495 --> 05:41.530
She was masking her IP address,

05:41.531 --> 05:43.031
but she stayed online long enough

05:43.032 --> 05:44.833
for us to break the firewall.

05:44.834 --> 05:47.002
- That doesn't sound like her.
- I know.

05:47.003 --> 05:48.103
We got lucky.

05:48.104 --> 05:51.339
One of the servers
she was using crashed.

05:51.340 --> 05:53.375
When it rebooted, we
got a jump on her.

05:53.376 --> 05:54.409
Even so...

05:54.410 --> 05:56.278
Well, everyone's got a weak spot.

05:56.279 --> 05:59.014
In Juliet's case, it's her kids.

05:59.015 --> 06:01.583
She was hacking the Webcam
in her husband's kitchen.

06:01.584 --> 06:03.084
Where is she?

06:03.085 --> 06:05.720
Tindouf Province in southwestern Algeria.

06:05.721 --> 06:06.821
Near the border with Mauritania.

06:06.822 --> 06:09.224
ELIZABETH: How remote are we talking?

06:09.225 --> 06:11.259
She's in a small structure
on the base of a mountain.

06:11.260 --> 06:12.731
There's nothing else for miles.

06:12.732 --> 06:14.095
Meaning we can't get close

06:14.096 --> 06:16.364
- without blowing operational integrity.
- Exactly.

06:16.365 --> 06:19.067
AFRICOM can have an armed
drone in place in five hours.

06:19.068 --> 06:21.203
Armed? What...?

06:21.204 --> 06:22.637
Did I miss something here?

06:22.638 --> 06:24.406
Get into it, Admiral.

06:24.407 --> 06:25.773
Yes, sir, Mr. President.

06:30.011 --> 06:32.047
Bess, I'm putting Juliet on the kill list.

06:32.048 --> 06:35.150
The attorney general signed
off half an hour ago.

06:35.151 --> 06:36.718
What happened to negotiations?

06:36.719 --> 06:38.253
If-if we bring her in alive,

06:38.254 --> 06:39.421
she could have Intel.

06:39.422 --> 06:40.755
And if she slips away,

06:40.756 --> 06:42.390
we might never get a
chance like this again.

06:42.391 --> 06:44.226
Given her location,
there are too many ways

06:44.227 --> 06:45.627
she can get tipped off that we're coming

06:45.628 --> 06:47.028
if we send in the cavalry.

06:47.029 --> 06:48.530
She's been stalling.

06:48.531 --> 06:49.497
That e-mail she sent you,

06:49.498 --> 06:50.498
claiming she wanted to come in,

06:50.499 --> 06:52.167
was obviously a ploy

06:52.168 --> 06:54.636
to distract us while she got ensconced

06:54.637 --> 06:55.870
in a non-extradition country.

06:55.871 --> 06:58.039
What about how it'll play?

06:58.040 --> 07:00.809
Executing an American citizen
abroad without due process?

07:00.810 --> 07:03.278
She's a traitor and helped
murder the Secretary of State.

07:03.279 --> 07:04.980
The A.G. says it's a slam dunk.

07:04.981 --> 07:06.381
Could look like a cover-up.

07:06.382 --> 07:08.149
Could look like justice.

07:08.150 --> 07:10.552
Russell's being a good soldier.

07:10.553 --> 07:12.520
20 minutes ago, he
made the same argument

07:12.521 --> 07:13.688
you just made.

07:13.689 --> 07:16.057
All our intelligence
assessments are unanimous

07:16.058 --> 07:18.526
that Juliet is the last
of the coup conspirators.

07:18.527 --> 07:20.729
There's strong evidence
that she's still conspiring

07:20.730 --> 07:22.264
with opposition elements in Iran,

07:22.265 --> 07:23.999
which means she arguably poses

07:24.000 --> 07:26.134
a clear and present
danger to American lives.

07:26.135 --> 07:28.903
We have a real shot at taking her out.

07:28.904 --> 07:30.071
We're going to take it.

07:30.072 --> 07:32.173
I know there could be blowback,

07:32.174 --> 07:33.975
but this is about national security.

07:33.976 --> 07:35.810
President Shiraz will be here

07:35.811 --> 07:38.980
to sign the nuclear treaty in two days.

07:38.981 --> 07:40.215
I'd like to put this behind us

07:40.216 --> 07:42.483
before I stand next to
him in the East Room.

07:44.686 --> 07:46.588
In that case,

07:46.589 --> 07:48.490
you'll need me to pave
the way with Algeria.

07:48.491 --> 07:50.458
You send in a drone
without their blessing,

07:50.459 --> 07:52.827
they'll probably shoot it down.

07:52.828 --> 07:53.995
DOD can handle the Algerians.

07:53.996 --> 07:56.164
Or spook them.

07:56.165 --> 07:58.533
Let the state department handle this.

07:58.534 --> 08:00.001
Velvet glove.

08:00.002 --> 08:02.637
Bess...

08:02.638 --> 08:05.006
it's okay for you to sit this one out.

08:05.007 --> 08:07.442
Not necessary, Mr. President.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.711
We're talking about you participating

08:09.712 --> 08:12.914
in the execution of your friend.

08:12.915 --> 08:14.781
Are you sure you're okay with that?

08:15.684 --> 08:18.418
Perfectly.

08:19.321 --> 08:21.722
Excuse me.

08:30.699 --> 08:32.466
Pick him up.

08:36.538 --> 08:37.871
(grunting)

08:40.008 --> 08:40.909
All right.

08:40.909 --> 08:41.943
- Good game.
- Good game.

08:41.943 --> 08:44.679
Good game, man. Good game.

08:44.680 --> 08:46.079
Oof.

08:47.082 --> 08:48.083
Hey, Henry.

08:48.084 --> 08:49.784
Looking good out there.

08:49.785 --> 08:51.119
Hey, Aiden.

08:51.120 --> 08:52.120
Oh, man,

08:52.121 --> 08:53.221
we've missed you.

08:53.222 --> 08:55.323
Haven't had a lot of free time lately.

08:55.324 --> 08:56.823
Kids.

08:58.193 --> 09:00.462
Listen, you got a minute?

09:00.463 --> 09:03.164
Of course.

09:03.165 --> 09:07.035
The kids set a spot at
dinner every night for her.

09:07.036 --> 09:08.470
And then when I tuck Lily in,

09:08.471 --> 09:10.638
she hugs the air and
kisses her mom good night.

09:10.639 --> 09:11.973
Now, every child psychologist

09:11.974 --> 09:13.575
says you have to tell kids the truth,

09:13.576 --> 09:15.310
but I don't even know what that is.

09:15.311 --> 09:16.511
I'm so sorry, Aiden.

09:16.512 --> 09:18.380
I could go to jail for talking to you,

09:18.381 --> 09:19.647
but I don't know what to do.

09:19.648 --> 09:21.716
Has Elizabeth said
anything about Juliet?

09:21.717 --> 09:23.752
Come on, man, you know better than that.

09:23.753 --> 09:25.820
You know, I was hoping that
maybe you could ask her.

09:25.821 --> 09:27.789
I would go to her directly,

09:27.790 --> 09:30.759
but I think they're following
me and bugging my phones.

09:30.760 --> 09:32.861
Well, okay. I-I can't promise
I'll get anywhere, but...

09:32.862 --> 09:34.262
Sorry to be a burden, man,

09:34.263 --> 09:36.464
but I don't know how much
longer I can take this.

09:36.465 --> 09:38.665
Come on. Come on, man, it's not a burden.

09:40.502 --> 09:43.838
Listen, we're having Lily's
sixth birthday party

09:43.839 --> 09:45.173
tomorrow at the house.

09:45.174 --> 09:46.541
We'd love for you guys to come by.

09:46.542 --> 09:47.776
She loves your kids.

09:47.777 --> 09:49.744
- It'd mean a lot to us.
- A lot to us, too.

09:49.745 --> 09:51.812
- I'll wrangle everybody.
- All right.

09:53.948 --> 09:55.850
You know, uh, for the longest time,

09:55.851 --> 09:58.686
I thought she must've
been having an affair.

09:58.687 --> 10:01.189
After our anniversary dinner last year,

10:01.190 --> 10:03.691
she went out to get milk.

10:03.692 --> 10:06.694
And I was so paranoid,
I did the craziest thing.

10:06.695 --> 10:09.831
I left the kids home alone, asleep,

10:09.832 --> 10:11.499
and followed her.

10:11.500 --> 10:14.102
Caught her making a call from the pay phone

10:14.103 --> 10:16.204
at the 7-Eleven on H.

10:16.205 --> 10:17.906
That's not very CIA.

10:17.907 --> 10:20.108
Yeah. Why not use the
secure line at the house?

10:20.109 --> 10:21.576
You know, I never told the FBI

10:21.577 --> 10:23.178
because I didn't want it to get out,

10:23.179 --> 10:24.546
for the kids to know.

10:24.547 --> 10:28.548
But now, whatever she's
into must be even worse.

10:31.219 --> 10:33.687
♪

10:55.743 --> 10:57.944
(elevator bell dings)

10:59.247 --> 11:00.815
Hey, Blake.

11:00.816 --> 11:01.850
Hey.

11:01.851 --> 11:03.618
Where are we on the Algerians?

11:03.619 --> 11:05.587
Uh, Ambassador Kateb
is about an hour out,

11:05.588 --> 11:07.121
en route from Baltimore.

11:07.122 --> 11:09.390
Jay, dry cleaner miss a spot?

11:09.391 --> 11:11.493
Sorry, this was the cleanest
one in my closet, ma'am.

11:11.494 --> 11:12.527
Been there.

11:12.528 --> 11:14.662
How is little cutie pie Chloe baby?

11:14.663 --> 11:16.431
Already got me wrapped
around her tiny fingers.

11:16.432 --> 11:17.599
As it should be.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.167
And I'm her favorite
spit-up target, so...

11:19.168 --> 11:21.503
Oh, that's for sure, but I'm guessing

11:21.504 --> 11:23.872
that's not what you were
angling to talk to me about.

11:23.873 --> 11:26.007
President Shiraz's visit
is in a couple of days.

11:26.008 --> 11:27.942
Yes, so I heard.

11:27.943 --> 11:30.712
All's going smoothly,
except today we found out

11:30.713 --> 11:32.947
that an Iranian man named
Izad Ahmadi is gonna be stoned

11:32.948 --> 11:34.983
to death in Isfahan
Province on the same day

11:34.984 --> 11:36.618
as the treaty signing.

11:36.619 --> 11:37.752
What's the crime?

11:37.753 --> 11:39.387
Being gay in Iran.

11:39.388 --> 11:42.023
Officially, they've had
a moratorium on stonings

11:42.024 --> 11:44.692
since 2002; unofficially,
local tribal councils

11:44.693 --> 11:46.327
have continued the practice.

11:46.328 --> 11:48.396
They're turning a blind eye
and gonna let it happen.

11:48.397 --> 11:50.198
The timing can't be a coincidence.

11:50.199 --> 11:51.599
NADINE: The hard-liners in Tehran

11:51.600 --> 11:53.468
are sending a message
to their base, ma'am.

11:53.469 --> 11:55.036
Yes, they are.

11:55.037 --> 11:56.704
Just because we're dealing with the West

11:56.705 --> 11:58.139
doesn't mean we're going soft.

11:58.140 --> 12:00.041
The optics won't be good.

12:00.042 --> 12:01.942
Especially for Mr. Ahmadi.

12:04.379 --> 12:05.780
Sorry.

12:05.781 --> 12:08.516
I should get back.

12:08.517 --> 12:10.585
There's more. Human Rights Campaign

12:10.586 --> 12:12.487
is planning a protest
outside the White House

12:12.488 --> 12:14.522
during the signing ceremony.

12:14.523 --> 12:16.190
Okay.

12:16.191 --> 12:18.493
Nadine, let's back-channel
with the Iranians.

12:18.494 --> 12:22.297
See if we can get them to at
least postpone the execution.

12:22.298 --> 12:24.332
And why don't you sit down with HRC

12:24.333 --> 12:26.000
and assure them that we are doing

12:26.001 --> 12:28.603
everything we can to stop the stoning.

12:28.604 --> 12:32.340
See if you can get them
to back off the protest.

12:32.341 --> 12:34.375
Poor Aiden.

12:34.376 --> 12:36.411
Well, we both know the
person Juliet was calling

12:36.412 --> 12:38.580
from that pay phone had to
have been Andrew Munsey.

12:38.581 --> 12:40.348
The night of their anniversary, huh?

12:40.349 --> 12:41.583
Yeah.

12:41.584 --> 12:44.352
I'm gonna have the FBI pull the records

12:44.353 --> 12:47.388
from that phone just to be sure.

12:47.389 --> 12:49.891
What should we do about Lily's party?

12:49.892 --> 12:52.026
We go! Definitely go!

12:52.027 --> 12:55.163
I mean, I want to give her a hug.

12:55.164 --> 12:58.566
A real one.

12:58.567 --> 13:00.835
I wish we could tell Aiden something.

13:00.836 --> 13:04.372
You might be able to tell
him something tonight.

13:04.373 --> 13:08.041
(cell phone ringing)

13:09.243 --> 13:11.444
Speaking of which.

13:12.914 --> 13:14.916
I got to go convince the Algerians

13:14.917 --> 13:16.918
to let us blow up Juliet, so...

13:16.919 --> 13:18.052
Oh.

13:18.053 --> 13:19.520
I think it's safe to say we've

13:19.521 --> 13:22.357
officially gone through the looking glass.

13:22.358 --> 13:25.193
And it's definitely not half full.

13:25.194 --> 13:26.828
You gonna be okay?

13:26.829 --> 13:29.196
Not even close.

13:30.679 --> 13:37.233
Subtitle sync and corrections
by awaqeded for www.addic7ed.com.

13:44.569 --> 13:46.104
Drone strikes often cause

13:46.105 --> 13:48.542
civilian casualties, Madam Secretary.

13:48.543 --> 13:52.012
True. But this one won't,
Mr. Ambassador.

13:52.013 --> 13:54.682
The structure is in a remote
region of Tindouf Province.

13:54.683 --> 13:56.650
We have clear signals intelligence.

13:56.651 --> 13:58.953
There could be civilians in the structure.

13:58.954 --> 14:01.155
I highly doubt this
target would allow that.

14:01.156 --> 14:02.489
Who is the target?

14:02.490 --> 14:04.158
An American.

14:04.159 --> 14:05.659
Of extremely high value to us.

14:05.660 --> 14:07.494
Show me your intelligence.

14:07.495 --> 14:08.796
There's nothing to show.

14:08.797 --> 14:10.064
It's a ping on a server.

14:10.065 --> 14:11.565
We don't need any more than that.

14:11.566 --> 14:12.933
Physical proof is superfluous.

14:12.934 --> 14:15.169
We're happy to cooperate,
Madam Secretary.

14:15.170 --> 14:17.237
But we want to do just that.

14:17.238 --> 14:19.573
"Cooperate." No drone strike.

14:19.574 --> 14:20.507
How is that cooperating?

14:20.508 --> 14:22.609
We have an elite anti-terrorist unit.

14:22.610 --> 14:25.479
We could join in a ground
operation with your Navy SEALs.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.882
That way, we confirm that this
person really is where you say

14:28.883 --> 14:31.051
before shedding any blood on our soil.

14:31.052 --> 14:33.020
That could compromise
operational integrity.

14:33.021 --> 14:34.521
The target could get away.

14:34.522 --> 14:36.657
I have already discussed
this with President Hamidou.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.559
He has given me very strict parameters.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.961
This is the best we can offer.

14:40.962 --> 14:43.030
We can have the operation on the ground,

14:43.031 --> 14:45.998
ready to go in 24 hours.

14:48.369 --> 14:50.069
Okay.

14:52.006 --> 14:53.273
How could you possibly agree to that?

14:53.274 --> 14:55.109
It was the best I could do.

14:55.110 --> 14:56.910
It's Algeria, for God's sake!

14:56.911 --> 14:58.746
You could've taken out your
wallet and done better.

14:58.747 --> 15:00.714
Practice and theory are
two very different things.

15:00.715 --> 15:01.849
We're the United States.

15:01.850 --> 15:03.250
We practice whatever the hell we want.

15:03.251 --> 15:05.919
Not if we want the
Algerians' cooperation

15:05.920 --> 15:07.755
against Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb.

15:07.756 --> 15:09.957
This isn't about some
pissant terrorist group.

15:09.958 --> 15:10.991
You threw it.

15:10.992 --> 15:12.793
You undermined national security

15:12.794 --> 15:14.495
and betrayed the
president's express wishes

15:14.496 --> 15:17.498
'cause of your personal
relationship with the target!

15:17.499 --> 15:18.632
Is that what he thinks?

15:18.633 --> 15:21.068
Why do you think he's not here?!

15:21.069 --> 15:23.804
I was worried he'd fire you on the spot.

15:23.805 --> 15:25.839
Which wouldn't play too
well sharing the front page

15:25.840 --> 15:27.174
with the Shiraz treaty signing.

15:27.175 --> 15:29.176
Probably a good call.

15:29.177 --> 15:31.945
Maybe I didn't go the
extra mile, Russell.

15:31.946 --> 15:35.249
But I am definitely not gonna
sit here and let you accuse me

15:35.250 --> 15:36.350
of insubordination.

15:36.351 --> 15:39.386
You're in dangerous territory here.

15:39.387 --> 15:41.722
We do whatever it takes to deliver

15:41.723 --> 15:43.657
the president his objectives.

15:43.658 --> 15:47.061
And that includes the extra
mile and every mile in between.

15:47.062 --> 15:49.963
So you either get on board
and you stay there...

15:49.964 --> 15:52.798
or you get the hell out of the way.

15:55.869 --> 15:58.739
President was right about you, Russell.

15:58.740 --> 16:02.076
Fighting for an objective
you don't even believe in,

16:02.077 --> 16:04.445
and still hitting below the belt?

16:04.446 --> 16:05.846
You are a good soldier.

16:05.847 --> 16:09.248
We all serve at the pleasure.

16:10.417 --> 16:14.253
This damn operation better
go off without a hitch.

16:15.355 --> 16:17.891
They better end up
writing songs about it

16:17.892 --> 16:20.259
in the Algerian hinterlands.

16:21.495 --> 16:24.231
HENRY: <i>After you risked
your life by going to Iran?</i>

16:24.232 --> 16:25.866
That guy's got a lot of nerve.

16:25.867 --> 16:27.601
What do you have to
do to earn his trust?

16:27.602 --> 16:28.902
(chuckles)

16:28.903 --> 16:30.237
Pretty sure Russell hits

16:30.238 --> 16:33.039
the trust reset button every morning.

16:34.041 --> 16:36.043
Besides, I can't say
he's completely wrong.

16:36.044 --> 16:38.212
And the president's right, you know?

16:38.213 --> 16:40.848
Juliet's a highly trained
operative gone rogue.

16:40.849 --> 16:42.449
Who knows what else she's capable of?

16:42.450 --> 16:43.817
Drone strike is a good call.

16:43.818 --> 16:45.219
Wait, hang on. Wait... hold on.

16:45.220 --> 16:46.787
What are you saying?

16:46.788 --> 16:49.356
You don't think you pushed
the Algerians hard enough

16:49.357 --> 16:51.624
for the drone strike?

16:53.360 --> 16:54.795
I don't know.

16:54.796 --> 16:56.930
Maybe not. I...

16:56.931 --> 16:59.867
I honestly don't know.

16:59.868 --> 17:03.002
But I'm... I'm not impartial.

17:05.138 --> 17:07.473
You don't want Juliet to die.

17:09.376 --> 17:12.179
Does that make me a traitor?

17:12.180 --> 17:14.815
No.

17:14.816 --> 17:18.150
Makes you human.

17:27.227 --> 17:29.396
NADINE: I reiterate that
this is coming directly

17:29.397 --> 17:32.766
from Secretary McCord, who is
speaking for the president.

17:32.767 --> 17:35.569
It would mean a great
deal to both of them

17:35.570 --> 17:38.005
if you could exert your
authority and postpone

17:38.006 --> 17:40.941
the execution of Mr. Ahmadi until...

17:40.942 --> 17:44.176
uh, if-if you... until at least...

17:45.712 --> 17:48.615
I'll let the secretary know.

17:48.616 --> 17:51.585
So much for a postponement, huh?

17:51.586 --> 17:54.321
Shiraz's office is hiding
behind their legal system.

17:54.322 --> 17:55.989
MATT: If you can even call it that.

17:55.990 --> 17:58.358
It's more like a "we
kill whoever we want

17:58.359 --> 18:00.027
whenever we want" system.

18:00.028 --> 18:01.929
If I put out the standard
boilerplate condemning them,

18:01.930 --> 18:03.530
it could interfere with
the treaty signing.

18:03.531 --> 18:05.232
Well, we still have another day.

18:05.233 --> 18:06.913
Let's keep our options open.

18:06.914 --> 18:07.968
Mmm, Jay?

18:07.969 --> 18:11.604
Brent Rosen from the Human
Rights Campaign is here for you.

18:12.673 --> 18:14.241
Without a postponement,

18:14.242 --> 18:16.610
I don't have much to get
them to stop the protest.

18:16.611 --> 18:18.645
Well, when all else fails,

18:18.646 --> 18:21.113
charm offensive.

18:23.450 --> 18:24.885
JAY: <i>Brent.</i>

18:24.886 --> 18:27.020
Thanks for coming in on the weekend.

18:27.021 --> 18:28.288
You're welcome.

18:28.289 --> 18:30.123
We're not canceling the protest, Jay.

18:30.124 --> 18:31.558
Did I ask you to?

18:31.559 --> 18:32.859
Water?

18:32.860 --> 18:34.394
Your people told my people

18:34.395 --> 18:36.230
that's what this meeting's about.

18:36.231 --> 18:39.533
How about we make it about
everything this administration

18:39.534 --> 18:42.369
has done for gay rights in the U.S.

18:42.370 --> 18:44.271
and around the world?

18:44.272 --> 18:47.274
You don't get extra points
for doing the right thing.

18:47.275 --> 18:50.911
The Iranian government is about
to let a man be executed

18:50.912 --> 18:52.412
because he's gay.

18:52.413 --> 18:54.815
And your boss and President
Dalton are gonna

18:54.816 --> 18:56.917
shake hands with the monster
who's allowing it...

18:56.918 --> 18:58.452
at the White House, no less...

18:58.453 --> 19:00.787
then treat him to a fancy lunch.

19:00.788 --> 19:02.556
I agree. The optics are terrible.

19:02.557 --> 19:03.924
This isn't about optics!

19:03.925 --> 19:05.859
It's about Izad Ahmadi's life

19:05.860 --> 19:08.462
and the millions of gay people
in Iran and around the world.

19:08.463 --> 19:09.529
Okay.

19:09.530 --> 19:11.031
But there's a bigger picture.

19:11.032 --> 19:13.333
We can't achieve all of our
goals with Iran overnight.

19:13.334 --> 19:15.235
And this deal could
prevent us from going

19:15.236 --> 19:16.637
to war to stop their nuclear program.

19:16.638 --> 19:18.839
Think how many lives we'll
save if we can do that.

19:18.840 --> 19:20.274
That's not what our protest is about.

19:20.275 --> 19:22.943
We know Dalton's gonna sign
that deal no matter what.

19:22.944 --> 19:25.279
You just don't want us
tarnishing your victory lap.

19:25.280 --> 19:26.713
Could you at least move the protest

19:26.714 --> 19:28.782
to the mall, the Lincoln Memorial?

19:28.783 --> 19:30.517
Anywhere but in the
president's backyard?

19:30.518 --> 19:31.785
I can help you fast-track permits.

19:31.786 --> 19:33.920
- There you go with the optics again.
- In the meantime,

19:33.921 --> 19:36.256
we will keep pushing
to postpone Ahmadi's execution.

19:36.257 --> 19:38.425
Oh, man, you are just so callous,

19:38.426 --> 19:40.060
and you don't even realize it.

19:40.061 --> 19:41.528
What?

19:41.529 --> 19:43.597
Trying to postpone it?

19:43.598 --> 19:44.765
For political reasons?

19:44.766 --> 19:45.866
Why not trying to stop it?

19:45.867 --> 19:47.901
Has that even crossed your mind?

19:47.902 --> 19:49.903
Look, I hate it just as much as you do,

19:49.904 --> 19:51.571
but it's Iran's affair.
We don't get a vote.

19:51.572 --> 19:54.708
How can you even say that
with a straight face?

19:54.709 --> 19:56.843
There are plenty of
levers you could pull,

19:56.844 --> 19:58.278
but you're just choosing not to

19:58.279 --> 20:00.113
because you don't
want to rock the boat

20:00.114 --> 20:01.948
- before the signing!
- It's not my call.

20:01.949 --> 20:03.884
So now you're hiding
behind your job description?

20:03.885 --> 20:06.553
You're giving quite the
clinic on evasion.

20:06.554 --> 20:08.288
But you know what the worst part is?

20:08.289 --> 20:12.626
Somewhere in Tehran,
there is a guy just like you.

20:12.627 --> 20:14.895
Some political operative

20:14.896 --> 20:17.297
who loves the idea of executing

20:17.298 --> 20:21.234
a gay man on the day
of the treaty signing.

20:21.235 --> 20:22.836
For the optics.

20:22.837 --> 20:24.871
And you know what, Jay?

20:24.872 --> 20:27.273
You're no better than him.

20:39.434 --> 20:40.861
Why do we have to go to a six-year-old's

20:40.862 --> 20:42.263
- birthday party anyway?
- Because!

20:42.264 --> 20:44.299
Because it's Uncle Aiden,
Aunt Juliet and the kids.

20:44.300 --> 20:46.734
Yeah, dude, as I recall,
it was about your sixth birthday

20:46.735 --> 20:48.536
- when they gave you Mr. Koala.
- That's right.

20:48.537 --> 20:52.360
Which you were obsessed with
until last year, I think?

20:52.361 --> 20:53.628
- Exactly.
- Okay. Okay, fine, fine.

20:53.629 --> 20:56.332
- But Juliet's not even gonna be there.
- All the more reason to go.

20:56.333 --> 20:58.734
- Lily and Miles love you guys.
- Yeah, but where is Juliet?

20:58.735 --> 21:00.703
And why is she missing Lily's birthday?

21:00.704 --> 21:02.805
- Honey...
- She's CIA! Use your brain!

21:02.806 --> 21:04.540
- Okay!
- Okay!

21:04.541 --> 21:06.308
- Noodle? Whoa!
- (gasps) Really?

21:06.309 --> 21:07.910
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

21:07.911 --> 21:10.279
You're really gonna let Ensign
Clueless fly the <i>Enterprise?</i>

21:10.280 --> 21:13.015
- She's got to learn sometime.
- Yeah, with us as crash dummies?

21:13.016 --> 21:15.017
Oh, come on, Mom's private
army's surrounding us.

21:15.018 --> 21:16.585
- Uh, listen, driving
- Okay.

21:16.586 --> 21:18.487
with a motorcade is trickier
than flying solo, so...

21:18.488 --> 21:20.122
Oh, great!

21:20.123 --> 21:21.724
I'm just saying.

21:21.725 --> 21:24.125
(children clamoring)

21:26.995 --> 21:30.331
(all cheering)

21:32.000 --> 21:34.603
At least she looks really happy.

21:34.604 --> 21:35.904
I'm glad we're here.

21:35.905 --> 21:38.407
Me, too.

21:38.408 --> 21:40.309
Hi, Lily Bean. Happy birthday.

21:40.310 --> 21:41.844
- Thanks, Aunt Bess!
- Oh, you're so big!

21:41.845 --> 21:43.846
Oh, my God! You're heavy!

21:43.847 --> 21:45.414
Did you make a good wish?

21:45.415 --> 21:46.915
Yeah, and I know it'll come true.

21:46.916 --> 21:48.217
Well, that's great.

21:48.218 --> 21:49.918
- Want to know why?
- Why?

21:49.919 --> 21:52.788
Because I prayed to see
Mommy in church last week,

21:52.789 --> 21:55.457
and I saw her in the
glass with the angels.

21:55.458 --> 21:57.593
Mommy had a golden halo.

21:57.594 --> 21:58.694
Wow!

21:58.695 --> 22:01.729
Well, you are her little angel.

22:02.931 --> 22:05.734
Oh, happy birthday, baby.

22:05.735 --> 22:07.236
Go get some cake. My...

22:07.237 --> 22:08.837
Hey, Bess.

22:08.838 --> 22:11.005
Hey, Aiden.

22:14.209 --> 22:15.978
AIDEN: <i>I can't tell you how much</i>

22:15.979 --> 22:17.246
I appreciate you guys coming.

22:17.247 --> 22:19.181
Oh, hey, it's our pleasure, buddy.

22:19.182 --> 22:22.151
I don't know anything about Juliet.

22:22.152 --> 22:23.752
Uh...

22:23.753 --> 22:26.536
Well, you know why the
FBI's been questioning me?

22:26.537 --> 22:28.104
I don't.

22:28.105 --> 22:30.173
W-Well, can you talk to anyone?

22:30.174 --> 22:31.541
- Aiden.
- At the Company?

22:31.542 --> 22:33.476
Aiden.

22:33.477 --> 22:35.711
I mean, if you find out anything...

22:35.712 --> 22:38.381
Of course.

22:38.382 --> 22:41.150
But you know the Company.

22:41.151 --> 22:43.286
Yeah.

22:43.287 --> 22:44.921
(chuckles)

22:44.922 --> 22:48.157
Lily and Miles could
not be more adorable.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.526
Yay...!

22:49.527 --> 22:51.460
Thanks.

22:52.762 --> 22:54.431
Thanks again for being here.

22:54.432 --> 22:55.465
Oh, yeah.

22:55.466 --> 22:57.100
Yeah.

22:57.101 --> 22:59.102
When-when did Jason get so big?

22:59.103 --> 23:01.503
(chuckles)

23:10.180 --> 23:12.682
You will be standing
just behind President Dalton,

23:12.683 --> 23:15.555
next to the Iranian
Foreign Minister Rahimi,

23:15.556 --> 23:16.815
who will be on your right,

23:16.816 --> 23:18.850
uh, here.

23:18.851 --> 23:20.751
When the presidents move

23:20.752 --> 23:23.121
from their podiums
to the treaty table,

23:23.122 --> 23:26.090
you and Minister Rahimi
will fold in just behind them.

23:26.091 --> 23:28.893
So I think I might have a
solution to our Iran problem.

23:28.894 --> 23:30.461
Oh.

23:30.462 --> 23:32.897
I'm sorry, I-I was supposed
to be in this meeting, wasn't I?

23:32.898 --> 23:34.866
Baby up all night, Jay?

23:34.867 --> 23:36.534
Amazingly, no.

23:36.535 --> 23:38.469
She slept like a... Ba-baby...

23:38.470 --> 23:39.804
Sorry, uh...

23:39.805 --> 23:41.772
I was working all night, though.

23:41.773 --> 23:44.775
And it turns out that Mr. Ahmadi
has a cousin in Michigan

23:44.776 --> 23:46.177
who's willing to take him in.

23:46.178 --> 23:47.652
That's nice.

23:47.653 --> 23:48.801
It is, because it also turns out

23:48.802 --> 23:50.360
that Jordan has an Iranian national

23:50.361 --> 23:51.694
on their death row for spying

23:51.695 --> 23:53.896
that the Iranians are
desperate to get back.

23:53.897 --> 23:55.765
That is really nice.

23:55.766 --> 23:57.900
Now we need an inducement for Jordan.

23:57.901 --> 24:00.870
Already talked to His
Majesty's judicial council.

24:00.871 --> 24:03.072
A few F-16s and a player
to be named later,

24:03.073 --> 24:04.406
deal sails through.

24:04.407 --> 24:06.642
Then all that's left is
for the Iranians to sign off.

24:06.643 --> 24:10.579
Which still may prove difficult
given Iran's motivation here.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.214
True.

24:12.215 --> 24:14.250
Regardless, ingenious
work; really, inspired.

24:14.251 --> 24:17.186
Thanks. I had a little inspiration.

24:17.187 --> 24:19.722
I hear that happens about
one percent of the time.

24:19.723 --> 24:20.756
Or something.

24:20.757 --> 24:21.924
Even less in D.C.

24:21.925 --> 24:23.893
All right, now go do
the perspiration part.

24:23.894 --> 24:25.261
You have my full backing.

24:25.262 --> 24:27.363
Thank you, ma'am, but do
you mind if I just...

24:27.364 --> 24:29.230
I'm starving.

24:30.666 --> 24:32.268
Okay, where were we?

24:32.269 --> 24:35.471
Folding. I was folding back in.

24:35.472 --> 24:38.274
Ma'am, you're needed
in the Situation Room.

24:38.275 --> 24:41.143
Uh, ma'am, it's five
hours to the signing.

24:41.144 --> 24:42.812
Um... it's gonna...

24:42.813 --> 24:45.447
I think I'm... and then I-I...

24:45.448 --> 24:47.383
We got it.

24:47.384 --> 24:51.187
Mr. Jackson told me to tell
you they're going in, ma'am.

24:51.188 --> 24:53.021
Thank you.

24:56.592 --> 24:57.793
What happened?

24:57.794 --> 24:59.728
Juliet Humphrey played us.

24:59.729 --> 25:02.097
It was all an elaborate setup.

25:02.098 --> 25:04.554
The assault team found a pint of
congealed blood on the floor.

25:04.555 --> 25:06.383
A solar-powered laptop

25:06.384 --> 25:08.294
and blood stained clothing.

25:08.295 --> 25:10.296
Prelim testing says it's hers.

25:10.297 --> 25:12.631
She knew we'd get the
computer server ping.

25:12.632 --> 25:15.166
She wanted us to do a drone strike.

25:16.135 --> 25:17.803
That's why she chose the location.

25:17.804 --> 25:19.004
She was counting on it...

25:19.005 --> 25:21.574
so we'd find her DNA and
assume she was dead.

25:21.575 --> 25:23.244
Interpol scoured every
possible exit point

25:23.245 --> 25:24.977
from Northern and Western Africa.

25:24.978 --> 25:26.412
Turns out she was at an airport

25:26.413 --> 25:29.081
in Nouakchott, Mauritania,
a week and a half ago.

25:29.082 --> 25:30.482
Then the trail goes cold.

25:30.483 --> 25:31.617
What's the evidence?

25:31.618 --> 25:33.451
Airport security photo.

25:37.990 --> 25:40.326
She's here in D.C.

25:40.327 --> 25:42.061
How do you know?

25:42.062 --> 25:45.063
LILY: <i>Mommy had a golden halo.</i>

25:46.031 --> 25:49.133
Trust me, I know.

26:01.513 --> 26:04.015
- (doorbell rings)
- I'll get it.

26:06.786 --> 26:08.648
AIDEN: Don't open the door
for strangers, honey.

26:08.649 --> 26:11.573
I know, Daddy. Who is it?

26:11.574 --> 26:13.003
Aiden Humphrey, FBI!

26:13.004 --> 26:15.185
What the hell is this?

26:15.186 --> 26:17.413
I didn't open, Daddy, I swear.

26:17.414 --> 26:19.982
I know, sweetie. It's okay.

26:19.983 --> 26:21.583
All right, I'm gonna talk to this woman.

26:21.584 --> 26:24.318
You go upstairs, play with
your brother, all right?

26:26.188 --> 26:28.157
You can't just do this.

26:28.158 --> 26:29.525
What the hell is going on?

26:29.526 --> 26:30.826
You're in danger.

26:30.827 --> 26:32.027
What do you mean? From what?

26:32.028 --> 26:33.929
I can't go into the
nature of the threat,

26:33.930 --> 26:36.532
but we will be guarding you
and your children 24-7,

26:36.533 --> 26:39.000
here and wherever you go.

26:42.738 --> 26:44.773
You said I'd never see you again.

26:44.774 --> 26:47.808
I have one more job for you.

27:02.924 --> 27:05.160
(clears throat)
FBI Director Hendricks, ma'am.

27:05.161 --> 27:06.394
Hi. How are you?

27:06.395 --> 27:08.129
Have you wrapped up the family?

27:08.130 --> 27:10.765
Yes, Madam Secretary, and put out an APB

27:10.766 --> 27:12.801
and BOLO on Miss Humphrey.

27:12.802 --> 27:15.470
If she's still in the metro
D.C. area, we'll find her.

27:15.471 --> 27:17.072
(chuckles) I wouldn't be so sure.

27:17.073 --> 27:18.773
No offense.

27:18.774 --> 27:20.408
I know Juliet Humphrey.

27:20.409 --> 27:23.078
Copy that, but you can rest assured...

27:23.079 --> 27:25.080
the Bureau is working in conjunction

27:25.081 --> 27:27.482
with the NCTC and the Secret Service.

27:27.483 --> 27:29.184
Now, whatever she's up to,

27:29.185 --> 27:31.419
the Iran treaty ceremony
won't be affected.

27:31.420 --> 27:32.887
Anything on the pay phone call?

27:32.888 --> 27:36.925
Uh, there was only one call made
from the pay phone in question

27:36.926 --> 27:38.760
in the time frame that you gave us.

27:38.761 --> 27:40.395
She called a burner phone.

27:40.396 --> 27:41.830
(sighs) So that's a dead end.

27:41.831 --> 27:43.765
Actually, we caught a break.

27:43.766 --> 27:46.568
That same burner was used
to call another burner phone

27:46.569 --> 27:48.903
that was seized in a drug
bust two days later.

27:48.904 --> 27:51.239
The owner of that phone is
serving ten to 15 in Cumberland.

27:51.240 --> 27:53.641
So is he willing to give
up his burner buddy?

27:53.642 --> 27:56.277
DOJ is making him an offer as we speak.

27:56.278 --> 27:57.612
Excellent. You keep me informed, okay?

27:57.613 --> 28:00.280
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

28:01.249 --> 28:04.017
Uh, Jay would like a word, ma'am.

28:04.886 --> 28:06.621
(sighs) Bad news?

28:06.622 --> 28:10.190
The Iranians flatly
rejected the prisoner swap.

28:11.092 --> 28:13.761
I thought they really
want their spy back.

28:13.762 --> 28:17.230
They do, but not as much as
they want to kill Mr. Ahmadi.

28:20.735 --> 28:22.303
Well, you did everything you could.

28:22.304 --> 28:23.705
Did I?

28:23.706 --> 28:26.608
Due respect, this isn't
horseshoes, ma'am.

28:26.609 --> 28:30.411
Izad Ahmadi is going
to suffer, unimaginably.

28:30.412 --> 28:33.248
Yes, he will.

28:33.249 --> 28:34.949
- Unless we play our ace.
- Jay...

28:34.950 --> 28:37.318
Tell Shiraz no nuclear deal
unless they release Ahmadi.

28:37.319 --> 28:38.553
Can't threaten to do something

28:38.554 --> 28:39.988
unless you're willing
to follow it through.

28:39.989 --> 28:42.255
Then let's be willing to follow through.

28:43.558 --> 28:48.630
I appreciate how invested
you are in this,

28:48.631 --> 28:51.031
but you and I both know
that's not gonna happen.

28:54.636 --> 28:57.238
That's Izad Ahmadi...
his cousin gave me that,

28:57.239 --> 28:59.140
from when he visited him
in Tehran last year.

28:59.141 --> 29:00.341
That woman there is his mother.

29:00.342 --> 29:02.109
I get your point, Jay, thank you.

29:10.151 --> 29:12.787
Do you?

29:12.788 --> 29:14.589
'Cause I did a little research

29:14.590 --> 29:18.059
on what it's actually like
to be stoned to death.

29:18.060 --> 29:21.529
At dawn, Mr. Ahmadi will
be wrapped in a shroud,

29:21.530 --> 29:24.199
bound with ropes and then
buried up to his waist.

29:24.200 --> 29:27.302
With the ground temperature at
50 degrees this time of year,

29:27.303 --> 29:29.571
he'll be shivering.

29:29.572 --> 29:31.873
Once immobile, he'll be pummeled

29:31.874 --> 29:33.875
with stones the size of tangerines,

29:33.876 --> 29:36.377
specially chosen to
inflict maximum pain,

29:36.378 --> 29:40.315
but not too big, so he
won't be knocked out.

29:40.316 --> 29:44.018
His ribs will snap and
break into pieces,

29:44.019 --> 29:48.423
lacerating his liver and kidneys
and liquefying his spleen.

29:48.424 --> 29:51.426
And if he's lucky, his
lungs will fill up,

29:51.427 --> 29:53.461
and he'll drown in his own blood.

29:53.462 --> 29:55.063
But if not,

29:55.064 --> 29:57.098
he could be conscious
for up to two hours

29:57.099 --> 30:01.401
as his body is pushed to
the human limits of agony.

30:02.303 --> 30:05.340
Of course, all of this
will be videotaped

30:05.341 --> 30:08.309
and uploaded to the local
council's Web site.

30:08.310 --> 30:10.044
Are you gonna be able to watch that,

30:10.045 --> 30:11.713
knowing we didn't do
everything in our power

30:11.714 --> 30:13.814
to spare this man?

30:17.118 --> 30:19.787
They stone women for adultery,

30:19.788 --> 30:21.789
girls as young as 13.

30:21.790 --> 30:23.057
If you're old enough to marry,

30:23.058 --> 30:24.726
you're old enough to
get stoned to death.

30:24.727 --> 30:27.729
They torture journalists
for writing articles

30:27.730 --> 30:29.430
that are critical of the regime.

30:29.431 --> 30:31.733
They arrest dissidents in
the middle of the night,

30:31.734 --> 30:33.101
line them up and shoot them.

30:33.102 --> 30:36.771
I know precisely what we
are dealing with, Jay.

30:36.772 --> 30:38.106
All too well.

30:38.107 --> 30:40.041
Why?

30:40.042 --> 30:42.710
Why are we dealing with these people?

30:42.711 --> 30:44.444
How could we?

30:46.080 --> 30:49.684
Because I have to weigh
Izad Ahmadi's life

30:49.685 --> 30:52.553
against the prospect of a
nuclear bomb going off

30:52.554 --> 30:54.289
in New York, D.C.,

30:54.290 --> 30:56.291
Tel Aviv.

30:56.292 --> 30:58.893
Millions of lives.

30:58.894 --> 31:01.929
Th-That's funny...
I-I used that same argument

31:01.930 --> 31:04.565
with Rosen from HRC just yesterday.

31:04.566 --> 31:06.734
But at what point do we
compromise away our soul?

31:06.735 --> 31:08.936
And how do we even know
when that happens?

31:08.937 --> 31:11.372
Maybe the hawks are right.

31:11.373 --> 31:13.574
Maybe we can't trust
people whose values are

31:13.575 --> 31:15.576
so horrifically divergent from ours.

31:15.577 --> 31:17.412
Maybe war is the better option.

31:17.413 --> 31:19.679
Maybe we shouldn't have
stopped that coup after all.

31:27.221 --> 31:31.292
You and I can agree to
disagree on this one, Jay.

31:31.293 --> 31:33.561
If I didn't like you so much,
I'd definitely fire you

31:33.562 --> 31:35.930
for that little outburst.

31:35.931 --> 31:36.898
(sighs)

31:36.899 --> 31:39.534
So, you did everything you could.

31:39.535 --> 31:42.769
Horseshoes notwithstanding.

31:46.841 --> 31:48.643
I won't be at the signing ceremony.

31:48.644 --> 31:49.877
That's okay by me.

31:49.878 --> 31:53.514
Those things tend to get
pretty crowded anyway.

31:53.515 --> 31:55.949
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

32:16.472 --> 32:17.739
You ready to go?

32:17.740 --> 32:20.208
I have FBI Director Hendricks
on the line for you.

32:20.209 --> 32:22.175
He says it's urgent.

32:23.444 --> 32:25.046
Hello.

32:25.047 --> 32:27.648
HENDRICKS: DOJ just reached
a deal with Mr. Burner Phone.

32:27.649 --> 32:30.651
Guy on the other end of the
Juliet Humphrey pay phone call

32:30.652 --> 32:33.521
was Brian Curtwell, former Army Ranger.

32:33.522 --> 32:36.290
We believe they crossed
paths in Iraq 11 years ago.

32:36.291 --> 32:37.625
Where is he now?

32:37.626 --> 32:39.492
He's a D.C. Metro cop.

32:40.395 --> 32:41.729
Have you picked him up yet?

32:41.730 --> 32:43.264
We literally just got this.

32:43.265 --> 32:44.898
We think he's on duty.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.468
- Where?
- The counter-sniper unit.

32:49.537 --> 32:52.639
Then he could be about to
assassinate President Shiraz.

32:53.241 --> 32:55.008
You need to pick him up now.

42:15.560 --> 42:19.529
and... I should be elated.

42:20.497 --> 42:22.865
But you're not.

42:27.604 --> 42:30.873
I haven't said this out loud,
not even to Henry.

42:32.209 --> 42:35.378
This is a safe place.

42:38.782 --> 42:42.086
As Secretary of State, I have
to make very tough calls,

42:42.087 --> 42:44.254
and I don't have the luxury of worrying

42:44.255 --> 42:46.657
about how they make me feel.

42:46.658 --> 42:48.858
That's the job.

42:50.594 --> 42:53.597
<i>But a very trusted advisor has
recently made me question</i>

42:53.598 --> 42:56.767
<i>our relationship with Iran.</i>

42:56.768 --> 42:59.103
<i>I still believe the treaty
was the right thing to do,</i>

42:59.104 --> 43:02.806
<i>and it'll probably be the first
line in my obituary, but...</i>

43:02.807 --> 43:05.509
<i>I'm afraid</i>

43:05.510 --> 43:09.013
<i>that when I interrogate
my old CIA friend</i>

43:09.014 --> 43:11.015
<i>and ask her why she did it,</i>

43:11.016 --> 43:14.251
<i>her answer might just make me question</i>

43:14.252 --> 43:15.753
<i>if the Iranians can be trusted</i>

43:15.754 --> 43:18.689
<i>to hold up their end of the bargain.</i>

43:18.690 --> 43:21.224
<i>And now I can't stop thinking...</i>

43:23.027 --> 43:26.897
<i>...what if this treaty
I fought so hard for,</i>

43:26.898 --> 43:31.201
<i>that people close to me died for,</i>

43:31.202 --> 43:34.714
<i>is really all a big mistake?</i>

43:36.383 --> 43:44.230
