<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:33.367 --> 00:35.461
Pajama slide!

00:36.828 --> 00:39.707
Good purchase, Mom.

00:40.749 --> 00:42.217
I haven't even finished
breakfast,

00:42.209 --> 00:43.461
and that boy ain't right.

00:43.627 --> 00:45.504
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

00:45.504 --> 00:47.302
You and Bobby
are on your own tonight.

00:47.297 --> 00:49.516
I'm going to Minh's
for Ladies' Game Night.

00:49.508 --> 00:51.476
You're leaving us alone?

00:51.635 --> 00:55.356
But you're a good buffer
for when things get awkward.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.769
Oh, Hank, you'll be fine.

00:56.765 --> 00:58.108
I hope we play Scrabble.

00:58.100 --> 01:01.400
I will be unstoppable
with my two-letter words.

01:01.395 --> 01:04.399
"Am, ho, id, na, is, if..."

01:10.028 --> 01:12.497
Oh, there's nothing
more beautiful

01:12.489 --> 01:16.039
than a man and his son
alone, bonding.

01:16.034 --> 01:18.457
A time when questions
will be asked,

01:18.620 --> 01:20.497
and answers will be given.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.920
Yeah, I was kinda hoping
we could do something

01:22.916 --> 01:25.510
that didn't require
a lot of conversation.

01:25.502 --> 01:28.426
You know the type of stuff
Bobby likes to talk about.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.095
Well, you could
rent a movie.

01:30.090 --> 01:33.264
Ugh, he likes to act out
the "funny parts."

01:33.260 --> 01:35.308
What about going
out to a movie?

01:35.304 --> 01:37.102
He likes to whisper at me.

01:37.097 --> 01:39.099
I say you take him to dinner.

01:39.099 --> 01:41.522
There'll be people around.
You can talk to the waiter.

01:41.518 --> 01:42.770
You have options.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.567
Yeah, like a date.

01:44.563 --> 01:46.486
If there's a lull
in the conversation,

01:46.481 --> 01:48.483
just put a bread stick
in your mouth to cover.

01:48.483 --> 01:50.861
You know, I've been wanting
to try that new steakhouse

01:50.861 --> 01:53.114
in McMaynerbury.

01:53.113 --> 01:55.491
If there's no live music,
that's what we'll do.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.414
My idea. Mine.

02:02.623 --> 02:04.751
So, uh...

02:04.750 --> 02:06.502
How's school?

02:06.501 --> 02:09.095
Fine.

02:09.086 --> 02:10.304
How's work?

02:10.297 --> 02:11.469
Fine.

02:19.806 --> 02:22.229
Two Kansas City strips,
medium-rare.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.230
Excuse me, sir.

02:26.229 --> 02:28.402
There's something wrong
with our steaks.

02:28.398 --> 02:32.153
These should be prime, and this
isn't the marbling for prime.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.280
It's fatty in all
the wrong places.

02:34.279 --> 02:35.405
Bobby, what are you doing?

02:35.572 --> 02:38.041
Don't insult a man's steak
without tasting it.

02:38.033 --> 02:39.501
You'll get us killed.

02:39.493 --> 02:43.418
I assure you, sir, our beef
is the finest in the county.

02:43.580 --> 02:46.709
And this bone
is so big and flat.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.461
Everybody knows the tiny bone
side of the sirloin

02:49.628 --> 02:51.346
is the most tender.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.466
What kind of steak joint
is this?

02:53.465 --> 02:57.095
Uh, look, dude, two days ago
I was working at a shoe store.

02:57.094 --> 02:58.721
I'll go get my manager.

02:58.720 --> 03:02.350
Wow, Bobby, you sure do know
your way around a steak.

03:02.349 --> 03:03.726
I'd have to
agree with that.

03:03.725 --> 03:06.854
I must say, I have never
seen someone so young

03:06.853 --> 03:08.446
with such meat savvy.

03:08.605 --> 03:11.108
I'm Roger Stiles,
Professor of Meat Science

03:11.108 --> 03:12.485
at Heimlich County
Junior College.

03:12.484 --> 03:15.203
I'm also coach of their
Meat Examination Team.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.448
What's a Meat
Examination Team?

03:17.447 --> 03:19.666
It's like debate team,
but instead of doing

03:19.658 --> 03:21.160
something useless,

03:21.159 --> 03:24.504
they compete by judging
cut and quality of meat.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.498
Yep. I come here every night

03:26.498 --> 03:28.967
looking for the missing link
to our team.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.178
And tonight I found you, Bobby.

03:31.169 --> 03:32.512
See, we're all
book learning.

03:32.504 --> 03:33.505
We need passion.

03:33.505 --> 03:35.382
Heck, I'm all passion.

03:35.382 --> 03:38.511
Dad, why didn't you tell
me about any of this?

03:38.510 --> 03:40.763
Because you're never
interested in anything good.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.014
What do you say, Bobby?

03:42.013 --> 03:44.015
You ready to take raw meat
to the next level?

03:44.015 --> 03:46.518
Can I, Dad?
Can I join the team?

03:46.518 --> 03:51.490
I have been waiting 13 years
for you to ask that.

03:51.481 --> 03:52.528
Absolutely.

04:00.657 --> 04:03.160
All right, Bobby,
show 'em what you got.

04:03.160 --> 04:06.255
Two rib eyes, one porterhouse,
three filets--

04:06.246 --> 04:09.500
One medium, two medium-rare--
And a New York strip well-done.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.843
Well-done, indeed. Oh, man,
look at that dang ol' boy.

04:11.835 --> 04:14.964
Aunt Peggy, you
must be so excited

04:14.963 --> 04:17.432
to have discovered
Bobby's hidden talent.

04:17.423 --> 04:21.099
It's like buried treasure
in his head.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.471
Or is it his stomach?

04:22.471 --> 04:24.439
It is very exciting, Luanne.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.149
Who knows where
this could take him?

04:26.141 --> 04:27.859
Oh, yeah, real far.

04:27.851 --> 04:30.730
He'll be able to skip a semester
in hamburger school.

04:30.729 --> 04:33.903
Yeah, this talent is
a party trick to nowhere,

04:33.899 --> 04:36.652
but it's cute you think your boy
will be successful someday.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.449
Soup's on.

04:41.490 --> 04:43.743
Perfect choice, Bobby.

04:43.742 --> 04:46.120
I've often thought my profile

04:46.119 --> 04:48.918
bears a striking resemblance
to a New York strip.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.212
Oh, this looks
delicious, sug.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.461
Where on Earth did you learn
so much about meat?

04:55.504 --> 04:58.474
One day you will
get to eat this.

05:02.511 --> 05:05.185
The cow says moo.

05:05.180 --> 05:09.686
The cow also says, "I have
11 distinct cuts of meat,

05:09.684 --> 05:12.153
each with its own
taste and texture."

05:15.273 --> 05:17.742
I guess it just
came naturally.

05:23.949 --> 05:29.501
And the coloring indicates a
fine to moderately fine texture.

05:29.496 --> 05:31.498
Pa-tow.

05:31.498 --> 05:32.795
Hey, Coach.

05:32.791 --> 05:34.418
I'm ready to work.

05:34.417 --> 05:36.294
Should I warm up
with some ground chuck

05:36.294 --> 05:37.796
or just jump right in?

05:37.796 --> 05:38.797
There he is.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.424
Everybody, this is Bobby,

05:40.423 --> 05:43.768
the one who's gonna get us to
State and take down Texas A&F.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.478
My name is Njorl.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.518
Norway exchange student.

05:47.514 --> 05:50.518
Already know herring,
need to know meats.

05:50.517 --> 05:51.769
And I'm Lucy.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.520
It's so super great
to meet you.

05:53.520 --> 05:56.364
You're totally gonna be better
than our last guy.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.404
He was deadweight.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.494
I can feel it.
This kid's a prodigy.

06:00.485 --> 06:03.159
I'm freaking out, guys.
I'm freaking out!

06:04.239 --> 06:06.037
Okay-

06:06.032 --> 06:07.284
Don't worry
about Ron.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.957
Things get pretty
intense around here.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.954
The smell of blood
in the air doesn't help.

06:10.954 --> 06:12.422
I'm so psyched
to be here.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.959
Look, I don't know
all the technical stuff yet,

06:14.958 --> 06:16.505
but what I do know

06:16.501 --> 06:20.256
is that the rib eye thickness
of that carcass is half an inch.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.678
Bobby's awfully late
from practice.

06:25.677 --> 06:26.894
His dinner's
gonna get cold.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.514
I know. Isn't it great?

06:29.806 --> 06:31.604
Hey, sorry I'm late.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.773
We were doing cartilage work

06:33.768 --> 06:37.068
and Njorl couldn't remember
his sacral from his lumbar.

06:38.481 --> 06:40.154
We all had a good laugh.

06:40.150 --> 06:44.405
Oh, Hank, he already has inside
jokes and smells like raw beef.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.997
I've got to tell you,

06:45.989 --> 06:48.458
it's pretty great
being a child prodigy.

06:48.450 --> 06:51.294
And Coach gave me this DVD:

06:51.286 --> 06:53.835
<i>From the Kill to Your Plate.</i>

06:53.830 --> 06:55.878
Do you want to watch it later,
Dad?

06:55.874 --> 06:59.720
Bobby, I would love to watch
Slaughterhouse with you.

07:02.672 --> 07:05.721
...where the heart,
lungs and viscera

07:05.717 --> 07:10.188
are separated for inspection.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.453
This is so exciting.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.743
Now, you've worked hard
for this and you're ready.

07:27.739 --> 07:30.037
All we have to do
is get fourth place

07:30.033 --> 07:32.377
to qualify for the
state championship.

07:32.369 --> 07:34.497
We're gonna do better
than fourth place!

07:34.496 --> 07:35.918
We're taking first!

07:35.914 --> 07:38.963
Texas A&F is going down!

07:41.378 --> 07:42.470
Break!

07:59.896 --> 08:01.398
All right, Bobby!

08:04.484 --> 08:06.031
Time for the final question.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.825
The four teams
with the highest scores

08:07.821 --> 08:09.448
will advance
to the state competition.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.161
The question:

08:11.157 --> 08:14.411
Which of these carcasses
has the most muscular round?

08:14.577 --> 08:16.830
Heimlich County Junior College,
you're up.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.341
Who do we send? Ron?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.461
Ah, I suck
at muscling today.

08:22.627 --> 08:24.470
Send me to organs
where I belong.

08:24.629 --> 08:26.006
Bobby?

08:26.006 --> 08:27.474
Bobby.
Bobby.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.183
I got this.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.887
Get 'em!
Do it!

08:31.886 --> 08:33.683
All right!
You do good!

08:33.679 --> 08:34.852
Go, Bobby!

08:34.847 --> 08:36.520
Come on, Bobby!

08:36.515 --> 08:37.688
Eat the whole thing!

08:39.184 --> 08:42.905
Which of these carcasses
has the most muscular round?

08:42.897 --> 08:45.446
Number two.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.495
I'm sorry.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.238
The answer is carcass four.

08:50.238 --> 08:52.206
What?

09:02.917 --> 09:04.510
Why do you look so down, son?

09:04.502 --> 09:05.924
Your team got fourth place.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.046
You're going to State.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.300
Bobby is going to State.

09:09.299 --> 09:10.846
We did it, Peggy.

09:10.842 --> 09:12.469
I wasn't sure.

09:12.469 --> 09:13.721
Between this trophy

09:13.720 --> 09:15.518
and your certificate
for attendance

09:15.513 --> 09:17.436
at vacation Bible school,

09:17.432 --> 09:20.311
I am one proud mother.

09:20.310 --> 09:22.733
I don't know
why everyone is so happy.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.403
I almost blew it
for the whole team.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.071
You're being too hard
on yourself.

09:27.067 --> 09:29.320
This was your first competition.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.493
If I had a nickel for every time
I buckled under pressure,

09:32.489 --> 09:34.787
I would have five nickels.

09:34.783 --> 09:37.252
But these guys are intense, Dad.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.372
I've seen Coach Stiles
hack up a cow torso.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.840
This is not a man
I want to disappoint.

09:42.832 --> 09:45.506
You know who doesn't make
mistakes, Bobby?

09:45.502 --> 09:46.503
Jesus?

09:46.503 --> 09:48.676
No! I-I mean, well...

09:48.671 --> 09:50.469
Yes, but no.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.890
Look, the point is,
your team is going to State,

09:53.885 --> 09:55.933
and that's all that matters.

09:55.929 --> 09:59.650
Usually your pep talks go
in one ear and out the other,

09:59.641 --> 10:02.690
but this time,
I'm feeling the pep!

10:06.481 --> 10:08.779
Hey, how's everybody doing?

10:08.775 --> 10:11.949
Well, if it isn't
Little Gristle.

10:11.945 --> 10:15.495
hot dogs and bologna.

10:15.490 --> 10:16.491
Okay, everybody, stop!

10:16.491 --> 10:18.459
We don't have time
for squabbling.

10:18.451 --> 10:20.954
Yes, Bobby screwed up
and he should be embarrassed,

10:20.954 --> 10:23.457
and yes, we would replace him
if we had time,

10:23.456 --> 10:25.049
but he's still
a part of this team.

10:25.041 --> 10:26.384
Thank you.

10:26.376 --> 10:28.504
I promise I won't let you down.

10:28.503 --> 10:29.720
You better not.

10:29.712 --> 10:31.806
Did you know that no one
can hear you scream

10:31.798 --> 10:33.675
from inside a meat locker?

10:33.675 --> 10:34.801
Interesting fact.

10:36.719 --> 10:39.393
I bet you guys
are dying to know

10:39.389 --> 10:41.312
why I'm holding
this piece of paper.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.775
I was afraid to ask.
It's been killing me.

10:42.767 --> 10:45.520
It's a form
to make a deposit for a seat

10:45.520 --> 10:48.865
on the meat team's
State-bound chartered bus.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.951
Ooh.

10:50.942 --> 10:54.412
There is no greater sign
that a competition is legitimate

10:54.404 --> 10:55.951
than the chartering of a bus.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.496
Yep. My son is going to State.

10:58.491 --> 11:00.493
Bobby and I will have
stuff to talk about

11:00.493 --> 11:02.495
for the rest of our lives.

11:08.960 --> 11:12.339
Trimness. Less fat
opposite the rib eye.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.261
Less kidney, pelvic heart fat.

11:14.257 --> 11:16.510
Less fat over the brisket,
chuck, loin, plate,

11:16.509 --> 11:17.510
inside round...

11:18.595 --> 11:20.347
I'm ready
to stop learning about beef

11:20.346 --> 11:21.518
and start eating it!

11:24.058 --> 11:25.810
Everybody knows
you don't sully your palate

11:25.810 --> 11:27.483
with meat the night
before competition.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.230
That's incredibly basic.

11:29.230 --> 11:30.823
That's day one.

11:30.815 --> 11:31.987
It's all sides.

11:31.983 --> 11:33.235
Family style.

11:33.234 --> 11:34.952
And an egg white omelet
to share.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.447
Oh, my god! It's
the Texas A&F team!

11:39.449 --> 11:42.498
Let's stab one
in the restroom!

11:42.493 --> 11:43.870
No! Let's blind them.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.964
They can't grade beef
if they can't see it.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.458
Bobby, hand me
the red pepper flakes.

11:53.213 --> 11:54.760
Wait, you're serious?

11:58.218 --> 12:01.017
Go grade some tofu, you losers!

12:01.012 --> 12:02.514
Oh, my God!

12:02.513 --> 12:05.517
Oh, my God! He just threw
pepper in their faces!

12:05.516 --> 12:06.859
What is he doing?!

12:06.851 --> 12:08.774
Thinking like a champ.

12:11.439 --> 12:12.406
How was dinner?

12:12.565 --> 12:15.739
Did you eat lots of protein
and say some prayers?

12:15.735 --> 12:19.990
We did neither, unless
you consider eggs protein.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.115
I do not.

12:21.115 --> 12:22.992
Turns out these meat team people

12:22.992 --> 12:24.665
are a bunch of weirdos.

12:24.661 --> 12:27.915
A boy who has a unicorn
ranch in his bedroom

12:27.914 --> 12:30.508
shouldn't call
other people weird.

12:30.500 --> 12:34.130
That's right. We know
about Rancho Unicorno.

12:34.128 --> 12:36.472
I am telling you,
these guys are freaks.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.885
They don't know where meat ends
and they begin.

12:39.884 --> 12:42.854
What you're seeing is
what's called team spirit.

12:42.845 --> 12:46.224
It's like the Holy Spirit,
but more powerful.

12:46.224 --> 12:48.898
Dad, I'm quitting the team.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.520
What? No!

12:50.520 --> 12:51.737
We were so close!

12:51.729 --> 12:53.697
Why would you
pass up the chance

12:53.690 --> 12:55.738
to compete at
the state level?

12:55.733 --> 12:58.486
Especially when
that state is Texas?

12:58.486 --> 13:00.284
I'm sorry, Dad.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.954
Well, I'm gonna
support this team

13:02.949 --> 13:04.371
whether you do or not.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.166
When Hank Hill reserves
a seat on a team bus,

13:07.161 --> 13:09.380
he is gonna be on that bus.

13:09.372 --> 13:12.296
Fine. Enjoy a bunch
of crazy people

13:12.292 --> 13:13.885
rambling about meat all day.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.844
You know that I will.

13:19.507 --> 13:20.759
Name, please?

13:20.758 --> 13:21.930
Hill.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.269
Hank and Bobby?

13:23.261 --> 13:24.433
Just Hank.

13:24.429 --> 13:25.726
Aw.

13:28.766 --> 13:30.860
He just quit on me, Kaylee.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.854
He thinks all these
people are crazy.

13:32.854 --> 13:34.197
Can you believe it?

13:34.188 --> 13:36.156
Sad.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.572
What the...?

13:46.451 --> 13:49.955
Listen up, people. Y'all
won't be going anywhere today.

13:49.954 --> 13:51.706
Least of all, the
state championship.

13:53.166 --> 13:54.509
That's right, jerks.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.502
You're being hijacked.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.971
Texas A&F rules!

14:06.012 --> 14:07.810
Cell phones
in the bag.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.524
Now!

14:10.516 --> 14:12.939
I knew this
was gonna happen!

14:12.935 --> 14:15.779
Why on Earth would you think
we'd be hijacked?

14:15.772 --> 14:17.149
It doesn't make any sense.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.491
Makes perfect sense.

14:18.483 --> 14:21.407
We are going to take
state championship from them.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.287
We must be hijacked.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.873
Y'all could kiss State good-bye.

14:49.138 --> 14:52.438
Wow, the Vogner "Little Man."

14:52.433 --> 14:55.437
Mm-hmm, your father wanted
to surprise you.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.188
It was supposed
to be waiting for you

14:57.188 --> 14:58.656
when you got back
from the tournament,

14:58.648 --> 15:00.446
but you're not at
the tournament.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.489
Dad got this for me?

15:02.485 --> 15:05.284
Yeah, he wanted
to grill together,

15:05.279 --> 15:06.496
just you and him.

15:06.489 --> 15:08.742
He doesn't want
to grill with me.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.210
All he cares about is
that I'm on some team.

15:11.202 --> 15:13.079
This isn't about
you being on a team.

15:13.079 --> 15:14.501
It isn't even about beef.

15:14.497 --> 15:17.216
What your father cares about
is that you two

15:17.208 --> 15:19.882
finally have something in common.
Really?

15:19.877 --> 15:22.050
He's never chartered a bus
for me, Bobby...

15:22.046 --> 15:23.798
as much as I've asked him to.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.678
Mom, get me to State.

15:43.109 --> 15:44.986
Excuse me, sir.

15:44.986 --> 15:47.489
I'm Bobby Hill
from Heimlich County J.C.

15:47.488 --> 15:48.910
I'm looking for my team.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.078
You're it, son.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.951
The rest of your squad's
a no-show.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.168
That can't be!

15:53.161 --> 15:55.334
All they've got is beef grading.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.501
Where are they?

15:56.497 --> 15:59.421
Your father's not answering
his cell phone.

15:59.584 --> 16:01.131
Are you in or out?

16:02.336 --> 16:03.508
Check it out.

16:03.504 --> 16:05.381
I'm in.

16:05.381 --> 16:06.428
All in.

16:06.424 --> 16:09.052
Every event.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.764
Hey, Hank.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.140
We thought we'd lost you.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.734
This is a stupid place
for a meat tournament.

16:16.726 --> 16:19.070
We were hijacked and stranded

16:19.061 --> 16:21.484
by meat-grading hooligans,
you idiots.

16:21.481 --> 16:24.701
Wow, I guess it's a good thing
we blindly followed you here

16:24.692 --> 16:26.490
instead of using a map.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.658
Or common sense.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.200
What are we waiting for?

16:29.197 --> 16:31.916
To the Beef-a-Bago!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

16:42.668 --> 16:45.171
Dang ol' hello?

16:45.171 --> 16:46.889
Oh, man, talkin'
'bout ol' Peggy, man,

16:46.881 --> 16:48.428
want to talk to you, man.

16:48.424 --> 16:49.926
Peggy?

16:49.926 --> 16:51.052
Really?!

16:51.052 --> 16:52.520
Oh, there was just a hijacking.

16:52.512 --> 16:54.514
I'll fill you in later.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.312
We're on our way.

16:56.307 --> 16:58.184
Great news!
Bobby's at the tournament!

16:58.184 --> 16:59.857
He's competing right now.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.069
Oh, no!

17:01.062 --> 17:02.234
He's going
to ruin everything!

17:02.230 --> 17:03.482
We're toast.
Despair for me.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.858
Hey, that's no way
to talk about your teammate.

17:05.858 --> 17:07.734
He's saving your hides
right now.

17:07.734 --> 17:08.736
Doubtful.

17:08.736 --> 17:09.907
He's terrible.

17:09.904 --> 17:11.247
He's a <i>fjortoft.</i>

17:11.239 --> 17:12.411
Come on now.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.454
Bobby may have
different talents than you,

17:14.450 --> 17:18.079
but one thing you all share is
your love of top quality beef.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.501
I don't care about beef.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.794
I only care about winning.

17:20.790 --> 17:22.041
Dude, I'm
a vegetarian.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.338
What?!

17:23.334 --> 17:26.338
You guys are even weirder
than Bobby let on.

17:26.337 --> 17:28.010
No wonder he wanted
to quit the team.

17:28.005 --> 17:31.305
I'm gonna sit in
the back with the cow.

17:31.300 --> 17:36.522
All competitors, please
report to the examining stations.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.278
This piece of veal thinks

17:42.270 --> 17:45.490
he's gonna beat us?

17:45.481 --> 17:46.903
I do my talking

17:46.899 --> 17:48.776
on the carcass.

18:02.415 --> 18:04.463
Whoo-hoo! Oh, yeah!

18:07.003 --> 18:08.505
The final event will determine

18:08.504 --> 18:10.927
the Texas State collegiate
meat-grading champion.

18:10.923 --> 18:14.018
Each team must determine whether
the specimen beef is prime beef

18:14.010 --> 18:15.512
or flawed in any way.

18:15.511 --> 18:16.478
Good luck.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.981
The competition's
still going on.

18:18.973 --> 18:20.646
We've still got a chance.

18:22.226 --> 18:24.274
Bobby's in the finals!

18:25.479 --> 18:27.481
Thanks for somehow
not screwing things up.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.483
But now is the time
when you choke.

18:29.483 --> 18:30.450
Step aside.

18:30.610 --> 18:34.035
Okay.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.453
It looks prime, but there's got
to be a flaw somewhere.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.163
It's perfect.

18:38.159 --> 18:40.503
This is the marbling
of your fantasies.

18:40.494 --> 18:41.711
They just want us to think

18:41.704 --> 18:43.081
there's a flaw.
It's a trick!

18:43.080 --> 18:45.082
Why aren't you
up there, son?

18:45.082 --> 18:46.959
They're afraid
I'm gonna choke again.

18:46.959 --> 18:47.960
But, Dad,

18:47.960 --> 18:50.509
I think I saw a flaw.
Really?

18:50.504 --> 18:52.347
I think so.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.388
It's something
in the chine button.

18:54.383 --> 18:55.430
Are you sure?

18:59.889 --> 19:01.983
Yes, I am.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.476
Then it's time to speak up.

19:04.852 --> 19:06.820
Have you reached a decision?

19:06.812 --> 19:07.813
Prime?

19:07.813 --> 19:09.190
Prime!
Prime?

19:09.190 --> 19:10.191
Prime!

19:10.191 --> 19:11.408
Hardbone!

19:11.400 --> 19:13.494
No, no, no!

19:16.030 --> 19:18.249
If you look closely
at the chine button

19:18.240 --> 19:19.412
Of the 13th rib,

19:19.408 --> 19:21.456
you will see
it has begun to ossify.

19:21.619 --> 19:24.498
This carcass is too old
to be prime.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.216
hardbone!

19:31.253 --> 19:32.971
Correct.

19:32.963 --> 19:36.012
Heimlich County
is the new state champion.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.162
Boy, I could listen

19:57.154 --> 19:59.407
to the sound of sizzle
all day long.

19:59.407 --> 20:01.876
It's pretty relaxing.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.506
What do you say we mooch
some hillbilly barbecue?

20:07.498 --> 20:10.422
I haven't finished
my organic chemistry homework.

20:10.418 --> 20:12.216
You're three grades
ahead already.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.463
Take the night off.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.183
Oh, thank you, sug.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.519
My headache feels a lot better.

20:20.511 --> 20:23.685
Well, I may not have
John Redcorn's healing touch,

20:23.681 --> 20:26.525
but I do know a lot
about the female body

20:26.517 --> 20:29.817
on account I once saw
a possum ripped apart.

20:32.440 --> 20:34.488
I smell beef!

20:34.483 --> 20:36.030
Don't even fool with shoes.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.245
Grab Gracie and let's go!

20:46.495 --> 20:49.465
Look at you,
my two Hill men.

20:49.623 --> 20:51.500
We might need more food.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.423
We've got company.

20:53.419 --> 20:56.764
Well, Dad, it looks like
this is the last one.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.724
Oh, you're just
getting started, Bobby.

20:58.716 --> 21:01.094
You'll be grilling
your whole life.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.470
Just like you.

21:02.636 --> 21:05.480
Yep.

21:56.565 --> 21:59.444
Yep. Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm.
