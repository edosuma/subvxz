It is Cha Yeong Min.

00:33.650 --> 00:35.410
You said last time

00:35.410 --> 00:39.680
that I spoke as if I were in Cha Yeong Min's body.

00:41.220 --> 00:41.990
Stop talking.

00:41.990 --> 00:44.090
It's not that I'm in his body.

00:44.090 --> 00:46.160
It's actually the other way around.

00:46.160 --> 00:48.430
Shut your mouth.

00:48.430 --> 00:53.030
What? What are you talking about?

00:53.030 --> 00:54.700
He's standing

00:59.770 --> 01:01.410
right next to me at the moment.

01:01.410 --> 01:03.040
And he's looking very mad.

01:03.040 --> 01:06.040
Don't you dare say one more word!

01:15.420 --> 01:17.420
Dr. Go.

01:20.130 --> 01:21.690
Why are you saying that to me?

01:21.690 --> 01:23.700
Don't you see that she's scared?

01:23.700 --> 01:26.230
Let's go outside and talk.

01:26.230 --> 01:29.370
Try to act naturally, and say goodbye.

01:29.370 --> 01:33.509
Even now he's still worried about Dr. Jang.

01:37.640 --> 01:40.410
Do you want to be possessed now?

01:51.690 --> 01:52.820
What's the matter with you?

01:52.820 --> 01:54.030
Why did you tell her

01:54.030 --> 01:55.530
without discussing it with me first?

01:55.530 --> 01:56.860
Isn't that what you did?

01:56.860 --> 01:58.259
Acted on your own without discussing it with me?

01:58.259 --> 02:00.470
I've apologized to you, haven't I?

02:00.470 --> 02:02.270
I tried to hold back but I couldn't help.

02:02.270 --> 02:04.370
You lost your senses suddenly because of Dr. Jang.

02:04.370 --> 02:06.770
Yes, that's right. And I still feel sorry for that.

02:06.770 --> 02:09.539
I may feel sorry for Dr. Jang, too.

02:09.539 --> 02:10.210
What?

02:10.210 --> 02:14.110
Perhaps she hates me for this.

02:14.110 --> 02:15.650
So, she forces herself not to get close.

02:15.650 --> 02:18.350
She even has built a wall between us.

02:19.220 --> 02:23.120
When will he wake up? Can he wake up?

02:23.120 --> 02:26.760
Seeing her stay with the one who has no consciousness

02:26.760 --> 02:30.000
and keep blaming herself when she did nothing wrong,

02:30.000 --> 02:32.160
I feel so sad for her.

02:35.400 --> 02:37.300
So, you told her

02:37.300 --> 02:41.470
that I've become a ghost, wandering around her,

02:41.470 --> 02:44.240
and that I can possess your body?

02:44.240 --> 02:45.340
You think

02:45.340 --> 02:48.150
she'd believe you like Han Seung Won did?

02:48.150 --> 02:51.480
Aren't you worried that she'd get scared and confused?

02:51.480 --> 02:55.150
You have something urgent to tell her, don't you?

02:55.150 --> 02:57.220
I think she has things to tell you, too.

02:57.220 --> 03:00.290
I will hear her myself and talk to her in person.

03:00.290 --> 03:02.630
I'll look at her in her eyes

03:02.630 --> 03:04.830
and tell her with my mouth.

03:04.830 --> 03:11.940
I'll be patient, and I'll tell her everything

03:11.940 --> 03:13.100
with my own mouth!

03:13.100 --> 03:14.810
But you don't even know when you'll wake up.

03:14.810 --> 03:15.810
No matter when!

03:15.810 --> 03:17.210
You'd forget everything when you wake up.

03:17.210 --> 03:18.610
Then I'll just start over.

03:18.610 --> 03:20.680
What if you can't wake up?

03:20.680 --> 03:23.010
I've seen so many people like you since I was eight.

03:23.010 --> 03:26.890
And most of them ended up staying unconscious forever.

03:26.890 --> 03:30.420
Until one day they were gone quietly.

03:30.420 --> 03:33.590
Have you ever thought that you could miss

03:33.590 --> 03:39.130
your chance to say goodbye to the girl you love?

03:39.130 --> 03:43.840
So you mean I'll die soon

03:43.840 --> 03:45.700
and I need to say goodbye to her?

03:45.700 --> 03:47.540
I didn't mean that.

03:47.540 --> 03:49.210
Yes, I'm aware

03:49.210 --> 03:51.010
that any complication

03:51.010 --> 03:52.640
such as pneumothorax, pneumonia, and septicemia

03:52.640 --> 03:54.250
would make me die and disappear.

03:54.250 --> 03:56.450
I know that.

03:56.450 --> 04:01.490
But even if I can't wake up, even if I die…

04:06.220 --> 04:11.430
Seung Tak, do you know why people can't remember anything

04:11.430 --> 04:14.070
when they wake up from a coma?

04:14.070 --> 04:16.600
Even the fact that they once became ghosts?

04:16.600 --> 04:20.570
Because they wouldn't be able to live if they remembered.

04:20.570 --> 04:22.970
Anyone who has such experience is like that.

04:22.970 --> 04:24.680
But the living people will remember.

04:24.680 --> 04:29.210
She'd remember the words I wouldn't even remember.

04:29.210 --> 04:32.680
Like you said, if I die,

04:32.680 --> 04:34.690
even I can't even take that,

04:34.690 --> 04:38.020
how is she supposed to take it?

04:38.020 --> 04:41.890
The world can only go back to normal

04:59.909 --> 05:03.750

05:03.750 --> 05:06.080
No one knows that better than you do.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.860
You talk about privacy a lot.

05:13.860 --> 05:16.090
This is apparently an invasion of privacy.

05:16.090 --> 05:18.560
Please don't cross the line again.

05:22.870 --> 05:24.340
You'd better solve the problem you created.

05:24.340 --> 05:26.770
You are good at that. Make things right.

05:29.510 --> 05:32.280
Dr. Go, what did you say just now?

05:32.280 --> 05:34.280
What did you mean exactly?

05:35.580 --> 05:37.080
What did I say?

05:37.080 --> 05:39.280
Hey, you brat…

05:39.280 --> 05:41.590
I don't remember anymore.

05:41.590 --> 05:43.190
I can't recall what I said,

05:43.190 --> 05:45.159
so just pretend that you heard nothing.

05:45.159 --> 05:46.290
What kind of answer was that?

05:46.290 --> 05:47.890
Hey, Go Seung Tak!

05:52.800 --> 05:56.270
I think I was really wrong about you.

05:56.270 --> 05:57.740
Yes, that's right.

05:57.740 --> 06:00.910
I admit that sometimes your words make me upset.

06:00.910 --> 06:02.340
I think it's my fault.

06:02.340 --> 06:04.040
Because the thought of losing someone I love is too painful,

06:04.040 --> 06:06.340
and it's the hardest thing I need to deal with.

06:06.340 --> 06:08.410
I appreciate your help these days.

06:08.410 --> 06:13.550
And I think we are dealing with this difficult time together.

06:13.550 --> 06:18.320
I believe that you truly cared about Professor Cha.

06:18.320 --> 06:21.630
But how could you say that you can't recall

06:21.630 --> 06:23.460
and ask me to pretend I heard nothing?

06:25.960 --> 06:28.870
Do you think this is the time for jokes?

06:28.870 --> 06:30.800
How could you make fun of one's life?

06:30.800 --> 06:32.000
What kind of freak

06:32.000 --> 06:36.040
would say those things about an unconscious person?

06:36.040 --> 06:39.010
Well, Dr. Jang…

06:39.010 --> 06:40.780

06:40.780 --> 06:44.120

31:38.580 --> 31:41.180
what... what kind of doctor is that?

31:41.180 --> 31:44.510
Why can I still hear this nonsense theory?

32:46.280 --> 32:48.210
Are you alright? If you feel too cold then you should get back into the car.

32:48.210 --> 32:50.180
I'm OK.

32:51.650 --> 32:53.950
It's nice here.

32:53.950 --> 32:57.550
I thought I would never see such nice scenery.

32:58.220 --> 32:59.720
Since you are in so much pain,

32:59.720 --> 33:02.790
why are you staying with Professor Cha Yeong Min?

33:02.790 --> 33:06.000
Nobody knows when he'll wake up.

33:08.100 --> 33:11.230
I apologize. I'm talking too much.

33:15.870 --> 33:17.640
Because I'm scared.

33:19.210 --> 33:22.210
I'm scared that I would let go of his hand again.

33:23.450 --> 33:27.120
12 years ago, I took the initiative to let go of his hand.

33:27.120 --> 33:30.290
I was a fool and lack of courage.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.430
I don't want to let go of him again,

33:35.430 --> 33:38.660
so I'm going to muster up the courage.

33:42.430 --> 33:45.070
But I'm starting to feel scared.

33:45.770 --> 33:48.840
I promised to save him,

33:50.740 --> 33:53.380
but I'm worried that I won't be able to keep the promise.

33:54.440 --> 33:57.150
What I can do is little.

33:58.780 --> 34:00.650
You are doing...

34:01.350 --> 34:03.550
what you can.

34:07.320 --> 34:09.690
Which is staying by his side.

34:29.179 --> 34:34.679
The store doesn't pick up. Director Jo must be very angry.

34:35.850 --> 34:37.150
Grandpa.

34:37.150 --> 34:40.159
My mom has found out,

34:41.960 --> 34:44.290
what will happen to me in the future?

34:44.290 --> 34:45.699
[Entrance]

34:52.600 --> 34:55.710
It seems that I've seen this picture somewhere before.

35:00.010 --> 35:03.910
That being said, it wasn't Go Seung Tak last time.

35:04.380 --> 35:05.650
Ah, Professor.

35:05.650 --> 35:06.880
I've heard that you are not feeling well.

35:06.880 --> 35:07.820
Are you feeling better now?

35:07.820 --> 35:08.450
Are you alright?

35:08.450 --> 35:10.450
I was scared when I heard the news.

35:10.450 --> 35:11.990
Dr. Jang, see.

35:11.990 --> 35:12.760
After taking one day off,

35:12.760 --> 35:15.690
you look better.

35:15.690 --> 35:19.760
To be honest, I've been doing too many meaningful things lately.

35:20.730 --> 35:22.830
By the way, did you take away the black card?

35:22.830 --> 35:23.930
Do you mean that?

35:23.930 --> 35:25.570
It's in Bro Jae Won's hand,

35:25.570 --> 35:27.270
to subsidize the cost of the Department.

35:27.270 --> 35:29.370
I lend you my body and car,

35:29.370 --> 35:30.870
and you still want my card?

35:30.870 --> 35:33.410
It's okay to just use my money once or twice…

35:34.540 --> 35:35.480
Anyhow,

35:35.480 --> 35:37.750
thank you for today.

35:37.750 --> 35:40.750
Why are you thanking me suddenly?

35:40.750 --> 35:42.850
Ah, well...

35:42.850 --> 35:44.150
The cost of the clothes

35:44.150 --> 35:46.860
is 584,000 Won... or 585,000 Won?

35:46.860 --> 35:47.920
Anyhow,

35:47.920 --> 35:49.460
remember to transfer the money to Dr. Jang.

35:49.460 --> 35:50.760
Thank you.

35:50.760 --> 35:52.360
Eh?

35:53.100 --> 35:54.360
The c... cost of the body.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.430
And clothes.

36:02.070 --> 36:04.270
I'm not in Cha Yeong Min's body,

36:04.270 --> 36:07.040
but he's in mine.

36:10.010 --> 36:12.120
I know

36:12.120 --> 36:14.750
how absurd this sounds.

36:14.750 --> 36:17.620
But I hope it's all true,

36:17.620 --> 36:20.360
even only for a day.

36:21.020 --> 36:23.660
I hope it's all like a dream.

36:41.010 --> 36:44.510
I actually study so sincerely like this.

36:46.380 --> 36:48.350
It's such a high wall.

36:51.920 --> 36:52.690
My God.

36:52.690 --> 36:54.060
Son,

36:56.090 --> 36:57.890
you wake up so early.

36:57.890 --> 36:59.300
My God.

36:59.300 --> 37:02.230
Did I wake you up?

37:02.230 --> 37:03.530
So Mom,

37:03.530 --> 37:04.970
what did you do

37:04.970 --> 37:08.470
to wake up your son who hadn't come home for several days?

37:08.470 --> 37:11.340
It's the water pipe construction.

37:11.340 --> 37:15.710
The water has been on and off recently, how troublesome.

37:15.710 --> 37:17.980
I don't know where it's stuck,

37:17.980 --> 37:21.850
the worker says the whole pipe should be replaced.

37:22.850 --> 37:23.920
What should I do? My God.

37:23.920 --> 37:26.520
-Dad.
-Yes.

37:26.520 --> 37:27.620
Are you alright?

37:27.620 --> 37:28.490
Yes.

37:28.490 --> 37:29.960
My dear Grandpa,

37:29.960 --> 37:31.360
why did you stand there?

37:31.360 --> 37:32.330
What should I do?

37:32.330 --> 37:34.060
My God, my God, Dad, what should I do?

37:34.060 --> 37:35.700
If you have something to say, just say it,

37:35.700 --> 37:37.830
don't spray water on me.

37:38.670 --> 37:39.300
My son,

37:39.300 --> 37:40.300
don't just stand there,

37:40.300 --> 37:43.270
go get a towel.

37:44.370 --> 37:47.540
The pipe, the wall.

37:47.540 --> 37:49.110
-Seung Jo.
-What should I do?

37:55.890 --> 37:57.690
Eureka!

37:57.690 --> 38:00.860
What's going on? Who is it?

38:03.030 --> 38:03.860
What are you doing?

38:03.860 --> 38:05.330
Why are you here at this time?

38:05.330 --> 38:06.600
Well, I'm Go Seung Tak.

38:06.600 --> 38:07.760
Take your time and get changed, I'll wait.

38:07.760 --> 38:08.730
I found something.

38:08.730 --> 38:09.700
What did you find?

38:09.700 --> 38:11.000
What did you find?

38:11.000 --> 38:12.740
It's blocked by a wall!

38:12.740 --> 38:13.900
What?

38:13.900 --> 38:15.810
Blood flow. The blocked blood flow.

38:15.810 --> 38:17.840
You brat, can't you just say it?

38:17.840 --> 38:19.140
Although the brainwaves have improved,

38:19.140 --> 38:20.980
there is a wall blocking something.

38:21.010 --> 38:23.110
That wall, blood vessel, Seung Jo.

38:23.180 --> 38:25.680
Compression of the internal mammary artery due to increased blood flow.

38:25.680 --> 38:29.250
Is it possible that Professor Cha's blood flow there also got compressed?

38:29.250 --> 38:31.050
The examination of this aspect...

38:31.050 --> 38:31.720
We have done it.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.590
CT scan of blood vessels. It was nothing at the time,

38:33.590 --> 38:34.990
and after that, we just watched his brainwaves

38:34.990 --> 38:36.830
because that's the most important thing.

38:36.830 --> 38:39.100
And now the brainwaves are turning better.

38:39.100 --> 38:40.760
Angiography.

38:40.760 --> 38:42.830
What are you talking about?

38:42.830 --> 38:44.830
Let's go.

39:02.190 --> 39:03.020
Let's begin.

39:03.020 --> 39:04.850
OK.

39:04.850 --> 39:06.760
Inject.

39:07.820 --> 39:11.590
The left subclavian artery is OK.

39:13.000 --> 39:14.200
Let's check the common carotid artery.

39:14.200 --> 39:16.200
OK.

39:19.540 --> 39:22.410
The left common carotid artery is fine.

39:27.110 --> 39:28.510
It's there.

39:28.510 --> 39:30.350
There.

39:30.350 --> 39:31.450
It's the humeral head artery.

39:31.450 --> 39:34.280
The humeral head artery is constricted.

39:38.550 --> 39:39.590
We found it.

39:39.590 --> 39:41.690
It's this one.

39:41.690 --> 39:44.430
Hey, how did you find it?

39:44.430 --> 39:47.360
Unlike somebody, I'm a genius.

39:47.360 --> 39:51.070
When a genius sees the apple falling, he thinks of gravity.

39:51.070 --> 39:54.940
When seeing a bathtub overflowing, he understands density measurement.

39:56.210 --> 39:57.340
Um, hey, hey.

39:57.340 --> 39:59.610
What should I do?

40:15.560 --> 40:18.900
My God, sorry, I couldn't help myself.

40:18.900 --> 40:22.800
It's okay, it's understandable to be overly happy.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.340
We found a solution to Professor Cha Yeong Min's low consciousness.

40:29.340 --> 40:31.070
-What?
-Really?

40:31.070 --> 40:34.440
-Awesome!
-How did you find it?

40:38.750 --> 40:42.290
Here are the results of the angiography performed this morning.

40:42.290 --> 40:46.020
Here, you can see the constriction of the humeral head artery.

40:46.020 --> 40:47.820
As a result, blood flow to the brain is reduced,

40:47.820 --> 40:49.890
which in turn leads to impaired consciousness.

40:49.890 --> 40:52.030
Oh, that's true.

40:52.030 --> 40:53.930
Why did we miss it all the time?

40:53.930 --> 40:56.500
Didn't we do the MRI and CT?

40:56.500 --> 40:58.770
I checked the CT taken at the initial stage,

40:58.770 --> 41:01.400
but did not notice any problem.

41:01.400 --> 41:04.210
After that, the state was not stable,

41:04.210 --> 41:06.040
so it was not reflected in the CT results.

41:06.040 --> 41:08.680
Professor Cha's brainwaves have improved recently.

41:08.680 --> 41:11.110
Could it be because of increased blood flow?

41:11.110 --> 41:15.720
Maybe it... can't be explained by medicine.

41:15.720 --> 41:20.420
Because it happened in an unfathomable territory beyond human measure.

41:22.990 --> 41:25.430
-Unfathomable territory?
-What unfathomable territory?

41:25.430 --> 41:28.500
He was fine just now, why is he like this again?

41:28.500 --> 41:30.330
How remarkable, Go Seung Tak.

41:30.330 --> 41:32.700
You actually found this.

41:32.700 --> 41:37.240
In short, as long as the humeral head artery problem is solved, Professor Cha can wake up?

41:37.240 --> 41:39.580
How should we resolve it?

41:39.580 --> 41:41.310
Artificial blood vessel replacement.

41:41.310 --> 41:42.810
Replace the entire humeral head artery

41:42.810 --> 41:44.910
to improve blood flow inside the brain.

41:44.910 --> 41:46.950
Of course, there is also a safe way, which is to use a shunt.

41:46.950 --> 41:48.020
But since he is a young patient,

41:48.020 --> 41:50.950
then the fundamental solution is correct.

41:52.990 --> 41:54.660
Is the surgery scheduled?

41:54.660 --> 41:55.460
Yes.

41:55.460 --> 41:57.990
It's scheduled at 8 tomorrow morning.

42:04.230 --> 42:06.570
I am going to do Professor Cha's surgery?

42:06.570 --> 42:09.340
Dr. Go, why are you doing this to me?

42:09.340 --> 42:12.170
Thank you for doing Seung Jo's surgery last time.

42:12.170 --> 42:12.910
What?

42:12.910 --> 42:14.980
Knowing that you might be in trouble because of that,

42:14.980 --> 42:17.150
you still bravely grabbed the patient's hand.

42:17.150 --> 42:18.810
You have stepped on the same boat as me since then.

42:18.810 --> 42:21.220
The same boat? I haven't gotten on the boat.

42:21.220 --> 42:23.990
Professor Cha will get on the boat after he wakes up.

42:23.990 --> 42:27.960
Can I get off the boat? I feel dizzy.

42:27.960 --> 42:30.290
Huh? Can I?

42:33.160 --> 42:34.500
OK.

42:34.500 --> 42:38.100
Then, Dr. Go, you will be the assistant, right?

42:38.100 --> 42:40.100
What? No.

42:40.100 --> 42:41.800
Didn't you hear what Bro Tae Sik said?

42:41.800 --> 42:44.070
How can we do surgery in a state like this?

42:44.070 --> 42:46.580
We successfully completed Seung Jo's surgery, didn't we?

42:46.580 --> 42:48.410
Perfectly done without flaw.

42:48.410 --> 42:49.510
It was dangerous.

42:49.510 --> 42:51.210
Because of that buffer.

42:51.210 --> 42:52.850
You said it was temporary.

42:52.850 --> 42:55.120
Do you know how anxious I was at the time because of that so-called temporary?

42:55.120 --> 42:57.020
There was also something happened that day we went shopping.

42:57.020 --> 43:00.020
I'll pay you back.

43:01.620 --> 43:03.530
Thank you.

43:07.600 --> 43:10.330
Gee, did I buy too much?

43:11.770 --> 43:12.800
Are you not confident?

43:12.800 --> 43:14.140
Forget it then.

43:14.140 --> 43:17.840
I'm not confident? I'm Cha Yeong Min.

43:18.840 --> 43:22.210
Could it be that my belief in wanting to save patients is inferior to others?

43:22.210 --> 43:24.080
You said that you are afraid of this kind of thing.

43:24.080 --> 43:26.750
You saved countless patients with this state of mind.

43:28.120 --> 43:33.190
Is there a doctor who wants to save you more than you right now?

43:39.000 --> 43:41.900
He's making a hit like that. Are you just going to stand by?

43:41.900 --> 43:45.230
You said you were going to let him go up the altar and then let him fall.

43:45.230 --> 43:48.000
But why does he keep going up?

43:48.000 --> 43:51.670
When will he fall?

43:51.670 --> 43:53.440
He's such an unenthusiastic boy,

43:53.440 --> 43:55.680
why did he suddenly start working hard?

43:55.680 --> 43:58.080
And now they say he's a genius. How?

43:59.380 --> 44:01.350
Is he really possessed?

44:01.350 --> 44:05.590
My God. We have to resort to exorcism.

44:05.590 --> 44:08.020
Hey, what are you talking about early in the morning?

44:08.020 --> 44:10.030
Aren't you busy?

44:10.030 --> 44:13.000
Being like this, aren't you afraid that he will take away the hospital?

44:13.000 --> 44:17.130
Gee, as an older brother, why have you always been in your younger brother's shadow?

44:17.130 --> 44:20.170
You keep losing to him.

44:20.170 --> 44:21.400
Director Go.

44:21.400 --> 44:22.940
I'm leaving, I'm leaving.

44:22.940 --> 44:25.340
Gee, I thought you were going to

44:25.340 --> 44:27.040
grasp the asset that belongs to you like what I did.

44:27.040 --> 44:29.710
I'm so disappointed.

44:41.190 --> 44:43.630
What's the matter?

44:45.960 --> 44:49.030
What? Who is going to take surgery?

44:49.030 --> 44:51.830
No, after taking it, then Professor Cha...

44:53.140 --> 44:55.370
So who is going to perform it?

44:55.370 --> 44:58.070
The surgery is not the most difficult.

44:58.070 --> 45:00.210
Because it's a second surgery, there may be some little problem.

45:00.210 --> 45:03.380
But I can manage to do it even with shaking hands.

45:03.380 --> 45:04.510
It's like Seung Jo's surgery.

45:04.510 --> 45:06.050
What is the most dangerous part?

45:06.050 --> 45:07.880
Where there can be no mistakes.

45:07.880 --> 45:09.790
Here, the native blood vessel and the graft blood vessel

45:09.790 --> 45:11.120
will be sutured

45:09.990 --> 45:12.190
[Native: Native blood vessels / Graft: Artificial blood vessels]

45:11.120 --> 45:12.460
when connecting the humeral head artery.

45:12.460 --> 45:14.390
If we accidentally tore the native blood vessel,

1:03:55.710 --> 1:03:57.810
I'm not sure whether he'll come back.

1:03:57.810 --> 1:03:59.180
I don't want to do it anymore.

1:03:59.180 --> 1:04:01.150
I want my life to be what it used to be.

1:04:01.150 --> 1:04:02.620
I don't have much time left.

1:04:02.620 --> 1:04:03.990
I am going to die.

1:04:03.990 --> 1:04:07.220
You might die before entering the operating room.

1:04:07.220 --> 1:04:09.420
There's a patient you need to operate on.

1:04:09.420 --> 1:04:11.890
If there is any slip-up, he might die on the operating table.

1:04:11.890 --> 1:04:14.600
You want me to operate on Professor Cha?

1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:16.730
This will probably be the last time.
