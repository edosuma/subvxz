Hey, where's hotch?

01:51.868 --> 01:53.267
Budget meeting.

01:53.334 --> 01:54.567
Maybe he'll get us a raise.

01:54.634 --> 01:56.234
They're cutting,
not raising.

01:56.300 --> 01:57.968
I just hope they don't
take the coffee.

01:58.033 --> 01:59.267
I'd quit.

01:59.334 --> 02:02.367
Oh, yeah. That'll save 'em
like 50 bucks a week.

02:02.434 --> 02:04.300
He'll meet us on the plane.

02:04.367 --> 02:06.133
Where are we going?

02:06.200 --> 02:07.434
Last night,
3 decapitated heads

02:07.501 --> 02:08.767
Were found in front of
a sheriff's station

02:08.834 --> 02:11.501
In the small border town
of terlingua, texas.

02:11.567 --> 02:13.100
3 victims at once?

02:13.167 --> 02:17.767
Actually, they appear to be in
different stages of decomposition.

02:17.834 --> 02:19.133
M.E. Confirmed that
one of the heads

02:19.200 --> 02:20.634
Is a day or so old.

02:20.701 --> 02:22.300
The other 2 appear to
have died a few months ago,

02:22.367 --> 02:23.801
But the wound edges

02:23.868 --> 02:26.200
Suggest that they were
decapitated recently.

02:26.267 --> 02:28.701
Dirt in their mouth,
ears, and nose.

02:28.767 --> 02:30.934
At some point,
these two heads were buried.

02:31.033 --> 02:32.300
And then dug up.

02:32.367 --> 02:34.501
Ok, so why the sudden need
to display them?

02:34.567 --> 02:37.567
Garcia: the need may not
be so sudden.

02:37.634 --> 02:41.000
Mexico, in 2009 alone,

02:41.067 --> 02:43.033
10 heads in coolers,

02:43.100 --> 02:44.734
And the people
belonging to these heads

02:44.801 --> 02:46.400
Were killed just hours
before they were found.

02:46.467 --> 02:49.033
Result of a battle between
feuding drug cartels.

02:49.100 --> 02:50.400
Dea's not interested?

02:50.467 --> 02:51.834
They asked us
to take a look at it.

02:51.901 --> 02:53.534
Considering the different
decomposition,

02:53.601 --> 02:55.234
This might not even
be about drugs.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.701
Then what do we have?

02:56.767 --> 02:58.534
Well, the victims
are two males, one female,

02:58.601 --> 02:59.901
So no gender preference.

02:59.968 --> 03:01.901
Staging the heads in front
of a sheriff's station...

03:01.968 --> 03:02.934
That's aggressive.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.834
All 3 victims are hispanic.

03:04.901 --> 03:05.868
And unidentified.

03:05.934 --> 03:08.234
Terlingua has a large
illegal population.

03:08.300 --> 03:10.767
It's made i.D.Ing the victims
that much harder.

03:10.834 --> 03:13.767
He might be trying to make some
type of political statement.

03:13.834 --> 03:16.400
Volunteer border patrols do a lot
of personal policing down there.

03:16.467 --> 03:18.033
Groups like
the minutemen

03:18.100 --> 03:20.701
Prize law and order
above everything else.

03:20.767 --> 03:23.767
And those patrols serve
their political agenda.

03:23.834 --> 03:25.601
Murder would be bad
for their image.

03:25.667 --> 03:27.534
Staging the heads
in front of a police station

03:27.601 --> 03:29.534
Suggests that the unsub
might be local.

03:29.601 --> 03:30.901
He'd have to have a knowledge

03:30.968 --> 03:33.934
About how to do something
like that without being seen.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.067
So what we have
is hundreds of miles

03:37.133 --> 03:39.000
Of unincorporated desert

03:39.067 --> 03:41.400
And an endless supply
of anonymous victims

03:41.467 --> 03:42.868
Crossing the border
every day.

03:42.934 --> 03:46.133
It's a serial killer's
perfect storm.

Chuck jones.

04:35.667 --> 04:37.267
Explain this to me.

04:37.334 --> 04:39.934
The unsub hunts along
the u.S.-Mexico border.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.267
How big is that area?

04:41.334 --> 04:43.901
Over 5,000 square miles
of desert.

04:43.968 --> 04:46.400
He could have gone
undetected for years.

04:46.467 --> 04:48.033
So why announce himself?

04:48.100 --> 04:50.133
Something happened recently.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.300
What do we know
about crime in terlingua?

04:52.367 --> 04:53.968
It's a stop-Over town.

04:54.033 --> 04:56.567
Immigrants stay only
24 hours before moving on,

04:56.634 --> 04:59.033
But that also makes them
narco-Trafficking hubs.

04:59.100 --> 05:01.467
Outside of immigration
violations,

05:01.534 --> 05:03.834
Most of the arrests
are drug related.

05:03.901 --> 05:05.634
That, my pretties,
is an understatement.

05:05.701 --> 05:07.300
Anyone familiar with
the lugo cartel

05:07.367 --> 05:08.634
Out of baja california?

05:08.701 --> 05:10.767
Their greatest hits...
the pun being inescapable...

05:10.834 --> 05:12.300
Include multiple
brutal murders

05:12.367 --> 05:14.334
Along with importing
and distributing

05:14.400 --> 05:16.000
Nearly 2 tons of cocaine

05:16.067 --> 05:19.367
And copious amounts of heroin
between 1990 and 2009.

05:19.434 --> 05:21.501
Now, if we get in
our bau time machine,

05:21.567 --> 05:23.000
Flash forward to now,

05:23.067 --> 05:24.701
A super cheap,
highly addictive,

05:24.767 --> 05:27.200
And totally impure
form of black tar heroin

05:27.267 --> 05:29.334
Just showed up
on the streets of terlingua,

05:29.400 --> 05:32.567
And the dea thinks the lugo
cartel is directly responsible.

05:32.634 --> 05:34.667
So they're expanding
their operation.

05:34.734 --> 05:37.167
Which is often announced
by a wave of violence.

05:37.234 --> 05:39.868
The lugo cartel killed
2 dea agents last year.

05:39.934 --> 05:41.133
We're going to need
to watch our backs.

05:41.200 --> 05:42.834
To cartels,
feds are fair game.

05:42.901 --> 05:44.667
There's even usually
a bounty, so...

05:44.734 --> 05:46.367
We're going to
bring in the toys.

05:46.434 --> 05:48.334
Be careful with those.
I don't need broken mp-5s

05:48.400 --> 05:49.367

05:49.434 --> 05:50.567
Guys, here's the thing.

05:50.634 --> 05:52.033
I don't think i technically
have authorization

05:52.100 --> 05:53.234
To carry a weapon
like that.

05:53.300 --> 05:54.434
You don't.
You don't.

05:54.501 --> 05:57.133
You know, we're going
to have a victim pool

05:57.200 --> 05:59.801
That is extremely
hesitant to talk to us.

05:59.868 --> 06:02.033
Prentiss, you and morgan start
with the migrant community,

06:02.100 --> 06:03.267
See what inroads you can make.

to catch a killer.

something.

06:25.300 --> 06:27.467

07:18.200 --> 07:20.467
We didn't expect you
for another half hour.

07:20.534 --> 07:22.100
How many, uh,
how many officers

07:22.167 --> 07:23.434
In the whole department?

07:23.501 --> 07:24.934
Including the sheriff, 5.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.534
There are 8 men outside.

07:26.601 --> 07:28.934
And that's the point, right?
To show that they outnumber you.

07:29.000 --> 07:30.100
Well, if it came down
to numbers,

07:30.167 --> 07:31.267
We wouldn't stand a chance.

07:31.334 --> 07:32.834
Those scumbags are only
a handful

07:32.901 --> 07:34.834
Of the soldiers who work
for omar morales.

07:34.901 --> 07:36.701
He's the head of a local
narco traffic ring.

07:36.767 --> 07:38.200
We picked him up
this morning

07:38.267 --> 07:39.300
Just outside of town.

07:39.367 --> 07:40.667
He was headed
for the airport.

07:40.734 --> 07:42.100
Has he made a statement?

07:43.734 --> 07:45.434
Not exactly.

07:45.501 --> 07:46.634
Meaning?

07:46.701 --> 07:48.968
Sheriff ruiz won't
let us talk to him.

07:49.033 --> 07:50.801
And why is that?

07:50.868 --> 07:52.701
Well, maybe you can
ask her why.

07:52.767 --> 07:53.968
Right this way.

Coffee?

08:07.400 --> 08:08.334
No, thank you.

08:08.400 --> 08:09.334
Ma'am, how do you
plan on dealing

08:09.400 --> 08:10.834
With the small army
outside?

08:10.901 --> 08:12.234
I plan on ignoring them.

08:12.300 --> 08:14.200
Well, we can have
some of...

08:14.267 --> 08:15.701
They'll get hot and tired
and go away on their own.

08:15.767 --> 08:16.868
They're the least
of my worries.

08:16.934 --> 08:18.434
We heard
you made an arrest.

08:18.501 --> 08:20.334
My deputies did.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.033
But you don't agree?

08:22.100 --> 08:23.467
Because they're wrong.

08:23.534 --> 08:25.267
Whoever staged these heads
in front of your office

08:25.334 --> 08:26.467
Is trying to tell you
something.

08:26.534 --> 08:28.367
Mm-Hmm. They want me
to butt out.

08:28.434 --> 08:30.767
Of what, exactly?

08:30.834 --> 08:32.433
I count more than
20 missing immigrants

08:32.501 --> 08:34.501
Just in the 6 months
i've been sheriff.

08:34.567 --> 08:36.868
That's more than
3 in a month.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.299
Almost one victim a week.

08:38.366 --> 08:40.801
These are just names
and cursory descriptions.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.167
Is there any other
paperwork?

08:42.234 --> 08:44.133
Has there been
any investigation?

08:44.200 --> 08:46.167
No one will make
an official report,

08:46.234 --> 08:47.667
But i believe somebody
around here

08:47.734 --> 08:50.801
Has been killing
for a long time.

08:50.868 --> 08:52.067
Want a laugh?

08:52.133 --> 08:53.968
I left brooklyn north homicide

08:54.033 --> 08:55.300

part of the country

08:57.033 --> 08:58.300

08:58.367 --> 09:00.300
This place is swimming
in dysfunction.

09:00.367 --> 09:03.200
It's a game of survival,
and i can't trust anyone.

09:03.267 --> 09:04.734
Ma'am, you've got
4 deputies.

09:04.801 --> 09:07.567
Who i expressly told
to leave omar morales alone.

09:07.634 --> 09:09.801
You can see how well
they follow orders.

09:09.868 --> 09:11.834
Then you're sure this
isn't the lugo cartel?

09:11.901 --> 09:13.267
Murder to send a message

09:13.334 --> 09:14.934
Is the way these guys
communicate.

09:15.000 --> 09:16.801
Come with me.

09:22.334 --> 09:24.067
You know, contrary
to popular belief,

09:24.133 --> 09:26.100
Decapitation is not that easy.

09:26.167 --> 09:29.100
Hmm. You don't often hear
popular and decapitation

09:29.167 --> 09:30.767
In the same sentence.

09:30.834 --> 09:32.868
You need to strike on the
weakest point of the spine.

09:32.934 --> 09:35.434
It's normally between
the c3 and c7 vertebrae.

09:35.501 --> 09:37.267
There are multiple strikes,

09:37.334 --> 09:39.467
But they don't show
any hesitation.

09:39.534 --> 09:41.267
I realize you didn't have
much to work with here,

09:41.334 --> 09:42.767
But outside of the obvious,

09:42.834 --> 09:44.968
Was there anything unusual
about these victims?

09:45.033 --> 09:47.467
Well, the second victim
appeared to have been blind,

09:47.534 --> 09:49.801
If not completely, then
he had cataracts bad enough

09:49.868 --> 09:52.267
That it was difficult
for him to get around.

09:52.334 --> 09:53.467
What about the other two?

09:53.534 --> 09:54.601
No.

09:54.667 --> 09:56.467
The most recent victim
is older.

09:56.534 --> 09:59.067
So is the first one,
the woman.

09:59.133 --> 10:00.968
Well, i only had
their teeth to go by,

10:01.033 --> 10:03.133
So it would take some time
to get an accurate age,

10:03.200 --> 10:05.100
But, yeah, i'd agree.
They were older.

10:05.167 --> 10:09.133
We're looking for something
that we call a signature.

10:09.200 --> 10:11.133
Something that all
the victims shared,

10:11.200 --> 10:14.467
Some physical mark,
something postmortem.

10:14.534 --> 10:17.300
Well, i don't know
if this is what you mean,

10:17.367 --> 10:20.501
But they all had sand residue
in their noses and throats.

10:20.567 --> 10:22.133
Could that be
from being buried?

10:22.200 --> 10:24.801
Possibly. But the trachea
and the nasal passage,

10:24.868 --> 10:26.634
They were kind of torn up.

10:26.701 --> 10:28.334
If i had the lungs here,

10:28.400 --> 10:30.467
I'd guess that they were
full of sand as well.

10:30.534 --> 10:32.434
You mean like they
breathed in the sand?

10:32.501 --> 10:35.300
Forcefully enough
that it lacerated the passages.

10:35.367 --> 10:37.234
They were running.

10:41.868 --> 10:45.067
This is agent hotchner
from the fbi.

10:45.133 --> 10:47.133
Nice suit.

10:51.868 --> 10:55.534
You know how much misery
that guy is responsible for?

10:55.601 --> 10:58.801
Yeah, i've heard some of the
things this cartel's capable of.

10:59.934 --> 11:02.501
Your boss gonna talk to him?

11:02.567 --> 11:04.334
He's gonna try.

11:04.400 --> 11:06.200
Good luck.

11:07.300 --> 11:09.133
Hotch: what kind
of message is this?

11:12.367 --> 11:14.300
It's funny?

11:14.367 --> 11:15.734
Kind of, yeah.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.968
A competitor
moves in on your business,

11:18.033 --> 11:19.200
Is that what you would do?

11:23.901 --> 11:25.334
Hypothetically?

11:25.400 --> 11:27.267
Yeah.

11:29.567 --> 11:31.534
I'd gut him
from crotch to chin,

11:31.601 --> 11:35.167
Then leave his intestines
open for the animals,

11:35.234 --> 11:37.501
After i sent his left hand
to his wife,

11:37.567 --> 11:40.067
His eyes to his mother,

11:40.133 --> 11:41.868
And his tongue
to his kids,

11:41.934 --> 11:46.701
With a note saying that their
papa had died wetting himself.

11:46.767 --> 11:48.868
A coward.

11:50.934 --> 11:53.834
This ain't no message.

11:53.901 --> 11:56.200
Hypothetically.

11:56.267 --> 11:57.868
That's an interesting defense,

11:57.934 --> 11:59.300
Saying that you would do worse.

11:59.367 --> 12:00.801
A defense? You asked me a question.

12:00.868 --> 12:02.267
You think i need a defense,
charge me with something.

12:02.334 --> 12:03.667
What do you know
about the heads

12:03.734 --> 12:07.801
That were left outside the
sheriff's station last night?

12:07.868 --> 12:09.067
Seriously?

12:09.133 --> 12:11.400
You're a man who likes
to be in control.

12:11.467 --> 12:13.968
You have a small army
standing guard outside.

12:14.033 --> 12:17.934
They protect you because you've
convinced them somehow that they need you,

12:18.000 --> 12:21.334
And you don't know
what's going on in your town?

12:21.400 --> 12:22.701
You didn't tell him?

12:23.801 --> 12:25.100
Tell me what?

12:26.534 --> 12:28.534
You're looking for
santa muerte.

12:30.367 --> 12:32.734
The saint of death.

12:35.467 --> 12:37.834
Sheriff, what exactly
is omar talking about?

12:37.901 --> 12:40.434
Every job has a patron saint.

12:40.501 --> 12:42.100
Cops have saint jude,

12:42.167 --> 12:44.133
Doctors have raphael
the archangel.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.133
But if you're a drug dealer
or a killer,

12:46.200 --> 12:47.334
Who do you pray to?

12:47.400 --> 12:49.067
The saint of death.

12:49.133 --> 12:51.834
I've learned that crossing
the desert to get here,

12:51.901 --> 12:54.100
You lose track
of the ways you can die.

12:54.167 --> 12:55.767
So if someone close
doesn't make it,

12:55.834 --> 12:58.667
Sometimes it's easier to blame
a superstitious figure.

12:58.734 --> 13:00.667
Well, omar doesn't seem like
he believes what he's saying.

13:00.734 --> 13:02.434
I didn't say he believes it.

13:02.501 --> 13:04.267
I said it's who people
are blaming.

13:04.334 --> 13:05.634
What people?

13:05.701 --> 13:07.701
Look, santa muerte has been
coming up more and more.

13:07.767 --> 13:11.133
The illegals i send back.
The coyotes i arrest.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.300
Some of the drug traffickers,
they're afraid.

13:14.367 --> 13:15.767
Afraid of a saint?

13:16.868 --> 13:18.300
I handled a homicide once

13:18.367 --> 13:20.801
Where my only witness
was this 4-Year-Old girl.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.534
And she told me her mom and
dad got killed by a dragon.

13:23.601 --> 13:27.868
Turns out the bad guy wore a
green rain suit with a pointy hood.

13:27.934 --> 13:29.834
To the kid
it looked like a dragon.

13:29.901 --> 13:33.634
So when hundreds of people are
talking about the same monster,

13:33.701 --> 13:35.367
It's a sure bet
something's going on.

13:35.434 --> 13:37.167
They just don't know
what to call it.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.901
Hotch: so they call it
santa muerte.

13:42.367 --> 13:43.367
[Man speaking spanish]

13:49.067 --> 13:53.234

13:54.300 --> 13:57.901

[Coughs]

14:13.234 --> 14:15.167
[Engine revving]

14:39.267 --> 14:41.767
I told you we should have
kept that bastard locked up.

14:41.834 --> 14:43.634
And i'm telling you
for the last time, boyd,

14:43.701 --> 14:46.100
Go back on patrol.

14:46.167 --> 14:48.834
No decomposition.
It's a new victim.

14:48.901 --> 14:51.667
He's becoming more focused
on you, sheriff.

14:51.734 --> 14:53.501
Sheriff, may i have
a word with you?

14:53.567 --> 14:55.601
It's clear
that this is personal.

14:55.667 --> 14:57.501
It always was.

14:57.567 --> 14:58.734
How's that?

14:58.801 --> 15:00.734
Look, i have no idea
how many of these people

15:00.801 --> 15:02.601
Have gone missing
over the years,

15:02.667 --> 15:04.067
But one thing is clear.

15:04.133 --> 15:05.567
I'm the only one
who seems to give a damn.

15:05.634 --> 15:07.033
That's as personal
as it gets for me.

15:07.100 --> 15:09.100
We're here
because we care.

15:09.167 --> 15:11.234
Well...

15:11.300 --> 15:14.400
All i've got is a bunch of
stories and superstitions.

15:14.467 --> 15:15.934
What if it isn't even
happening?

15:16.000 --> 15:18.267
Sheriff, i can't tell you
how long this has been going on,

15:18.334 --> 15:19.868
But something's definitely
happening now.

15:19.934 --> 15:21.934
And from the way
the unsub is acting,

15:22.000 --> 15:25.100
It's obvious
that you've touched a nerve.

15:25.167 --> 15:27.434
Whoever he is, i think
you've probably talked to him.

15:27.501 --> 15:29.300
I've talked to anyone
who will listen.

15:29.367 --> 15:31.267
Drug dealers, immigrants,
business owners...

15:31.334 --> 15:33.367
Well, one of them
is your santa muerte,

15:33.434 --> 15:35.133
And he's feeling
the pressure.

15:35.200 --> 15:36.434
When we get back
to the station,

15:36.501 --> 15:38.367
I want to go over every
single interview you've done.

15:38.434 --> 15:40.601
How? Who are we even
looking for?

15:40.667 --> 15:44.000
We have a profile
to give you and your deputies.

15:44.067 --> 15:47.334
We're searching for a personality
type called a human predator...

15:47.400 --> 15:49.267
In the classic sense,
a hunter.

15:49.334 --> 15:51.167
All the victims
we've been able

15:51.234 --> 15:52.467
To conclusively
tie to him

15:52.534 --> 15:54.133
Have been older or
handicapped in some way.

15:54.200 --> 15:57.701
This suggests he waits for
someone to separate from the pack,

15:57.767 --> 15:58.801
Looks for the weakest.

15:58.868 --> 16:00.234
Like a lion
or something.

16:00.300 --> 16:01.601
Except a lion hunts food.

16:01.667 --> 16:03.934
This type of predator
hunts power.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.501
It's not about
serving a need,

16:05.567 --> 16:07.167
And everything
is a means to that end.

16:07.234 --> 16:09.334
We also believe that he makes
his victims run through the desert

16:09.400 --> 16:11.167
In order to weaken them.

16:11.234 --> 16:13.400
He may not be capable of taking
them on in their strongest state,

16:13.467 --> 16:14.934
Despite their age
or infirmity.

16:15.000 --> 16:18.200
This suggests that he's possibly
handicapped in some way himself.

16:18.267 --> 16:20.734
Certainly weak,
maybe small or even thin.

16:20.801 --> 16:23.300
And an unsub who creates
chaos and then attacks

16:23.367 --> 16:25.434
Typically carries this through
to all aspects of his life.

16:25.501 --> 16:27.267
He's unlikely to be
in a relationship.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.100
If he is,
it's an abusive one.

16:29.167 --> 16:30.767
This guy gets off
on control.

16:30.834 --> 16:32.534
He will have tried to stay
very close to the investigation.

16:32.601 --> 16:33.934
He's well aware
that the sheriff

16:34.000 --> 16:35.701
Has started looking into
the missing illegal immigrants.

16:35.767 --> 16:37.200
How do you know that?

16:37.267 --> 16:39.267
It's probably why the
decapitations started,

16:39.334 --> 16:40.601
As a countermeasure.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.434
He's trying to throw off
the investigation.

16:42.501 --> 16:45.367
It's typical in an
organized offender like this.

16:45.434 --> 16:47.167
Cary stayner,
the yosemite killer,

16:47.234 --> 16:49.434
Drove more than 50 miles
to dump cigarette packs

16:49.501 --> 16:52.167
And driver's licenses at
intersections to throw off suspicion.

16:52.234 --> 16:54.133
Start by looking back
at everyone you've talked to

16:54.200 --> 16:55.801
In connection
with these killings.

16:55.868 --> 16:57.200
We need to start
with people

16:57.267 --> 16:58.734
Who are familiar with
the immigrant journey.

16:58.801 --> 17:01.501
Like who? Advocates? None of
them will talk to us. I've tried.

17:01.567 --> 17:03.567
Well, the coyotes
want this guy caught.

17:03.634 --> 17:04.901
He's hurting their business.

17:04.968 --> 17:07.567
And if the advocates really
care about the immigrants,

17:07.634 --> 17:10.000
They're gonna want to find
whoever is responsible as well.

17:10.067 --> 17:11.501
There's one guy
who could help.

17:11.567 --> 17:14.233
He runs an outreach program
called libertad.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.701
Where can we find him?

17:15.767 --> 17:20.300
Clyde, you want to take them
over to meet richard corral?

17:21.968 --> 17:23.800
My lucky day.

17:31.968 --> 17:35.734
These fbi agents
want a word with you.

17:35.801 --> 17:38.601

Hey, baby girl, i need you to
run a check on someone for me.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.934
What is wrong with you,
clyde?

17:49.000 --> 17:50.434
None of my clients
will trust me

17:50.501 --> 17:52.100
If i've got federal agents
walking around here.

17:52.167 --> 17:53.767
Well, maybe you shouldn't
spend your time

17:53.834 --> 17:55.267
Helping illegals
sneak into the country.

17:55.334 --> 17:57.400
They only want
a better life.

17:57.467 --> 17:58.934
Well, then, they ought to
come in the front door.

17:59.000 --> 18:01.267
Uh, gentlemen,
another day?

18:02.601 --> 18:04.000
Mr. Corral,

18:04.067 --> 18:05.601
We understand
your hesitation,

18:05.667 --> 18:08.133
But we aren't here about
immigration, we're here about murder.

18:08.200 --> 18:09.934
Do you know anything
about the heads

18:10.000 --> 18:12.701
That were left in front of the
sheriff's station a few days ago?

18:12.767 --> 18:15.300
Everyone does.
My clients are terrified.

18:15.367 --> 18:16.300
Clients.

18:16.367 --> 18:18.234
Deputy...

18:18.300 --> 18:20.801
Another man was murdered
last night.

18:20.868 --> 18:21.868
An immigrant.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.400
We need to figure out
how this man

18:23.467 --> 18:24.901
Finds his victims.

18:24.968 --> 18:26.801
Sheriff ruiz said you know

18:26.868 --> 18:28.734
More about these people's
journey than anyone.

18:28.801 --> 18:30.133
Yeah.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.200
How many places
are there to cross?

18:32.267 --> 18:34.067
For every tunnel we find,

18:34.133 --> 18:35.968
There's 12 more
we don't know about.

18:36.033 --> 18:38.234
And once they've made it?

18:38.300 --> 18:40.434
Runners keep documents in
the trunks of their cars.

18:40.501 --> 18:43.400
Passports, fake social
security numbers, green cards.

18:43.467 --> 18:45.067
It's a big business.

18:45.133 --> 18:46.501
Especially in border towns.

18:46.567 --> 18:48.067
Do you know these runners?

18:48.133 --> 18:50.100
They change all the time.

18:50.167 --> 18:52.334
If immigrants don't
find you, where do they go?

18:52.400 --> 18:54.167
Safe houses.

18:54.234 --> 18:56.367
It's supposed to be
where they can find rest,

18:56.434 --> 18:57.801
Water, food.

18:57.868 --> 18:59.033
Supposed to be?

18:59.100 --> 19:00.701
It's more like a prison,

19:00.767 --> 19:03.033
Until their families
can pay off the coyotes.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.701
Where are these
safe houses?

19:04.767 --> 19:06.033
Are you kidding?

19:06.100 --> 19:08.834
They come and go
faster than the tunnels.

19:11.033 --> 19:12.901
Ok. Thank you
for your time.

19:24.968 --> 19:27.701
Sheriff, we could use a hand
with the geographical profile.

19:27.767 --> 19:30.067
We're trying to locate
likely safe houses.

19:30.133 --> 19:33.400
Your team travels all
around the country, right?

19:33.467 --> 19:34.601
That's right.

19:34.667 --> 19:37.701
My last year in homicide,
i handled 36 murders.

19:37.767 --> 19:40.234
I was one of 20 detectives
in my unit.

19:40.300 --> 19:41.968
Do the math.

19:43.701 --> 19:45.934
Don't ask me
how many i solved.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.868
I'm sure you did
the best you could.

19:47.934 --> 19:50.033
There really isn't
anywhere to go

19:50.100 --> 19:52.868
Where people aren't killing
each other, is there?

19:52.934 --> 19:54.100
Likely safe houses?

19:54.167 --> 19:56.601
Even if we could find
a safe house,

19:56.667 --> 19:59.934
You really think someone who
just crossed is gonna talk to us?

20:00.000 --> 20:03.133
Well, there's a good chance that last
night's victim didn't cross alone.

20:03.200 --> 20:04.434
Someone may be missing him.

20:04.501 --> 20:05.968
If last night's illegals
are still at safe houses,

20:06.033 --> 20:07.234
We can find
the route they used

20:07.300 --> 20:08.801
And we'll know the
unsub's hunting grounds.

20:08.868 --> 20:11.267
The whole point of a safe house
is it's a secret.

20:11.334 --> 20:13.501
If i could find them,
i'd shut them down.

20:13.567 --> 20:15.601
All right, if it's
a first stop,

20:15.667 --> 20:18.701
We should start with homes
that are closest to the border.

20:18.767 --> 20:20.901
I could pull land deeds.
Might take a while.

20:20.968 --> 20:22.534
We've got
something faster.

20:22.601 --> 20:24.033
Sir.
Hotch: garcia.

20:24.100 --> 20:26.467
We're looking for illegal
immigrant safe houses in terlingua.

20:26.534 --> 20:27.801
Mm-Hmm. What are
the parameters?

20:27.868 --> 20:30.200
Start with homeowners and
renters with criminal records.

20:30.267 --> 20:32.234
Uh-Huh. That's a start.
Give me more.

20:32.300 --> 20:33.901
Morgan said they're always
moving. Look for homes

20:33.968 --> 20:34.901
With short-Term leases.

20:34.968 --> 20:36.367
Reid: and spikes in utilities.

20:36.434 --> 20:37.534
If they're housing illegals,

20:37.601 --> 20:38.834

Reid, jj, stay out here
and stay alert.

33:07.767 --> 33:08.968
Yeah.

33:29.734 --> 33:31.200
It's gentry.

33:41.267 --> 33:43.667
Does this look
legit to you?

33:43.734 --> 33:45.334
Omar took shotgun hits.

33:45.400 --> 33:47.701
Gentry only has a pistol.

33:47.767 --> 33:50.367
There's no powder residue
on omar's hands, either.

33:50.434 --> 33:53.067
Oh, my god.
What if he heard me?

33:53.133 --> 33:54.934
Gannon,
where would boyd go?

33:55.000 --> 33:56.000
I don't know.

33:56.067 --> 33:57.567
This is no time
to be covering up.

33:57.634 --> 33:58.868
He killed your boss
and gentry.

33:58.934 --> 34:00.701
I'm not covering.
I don't know the guy that well.

34:00.767 --> 34:02.501
No one does. He's a loner.

34:02.567 --> 34:03.734
[Ring]

34:03.801 --> 34:05.100
My liege.

34:05.167 --> 34:06.601
Garcia, deputy boyd
is our unsub.

34:06.667 --> 34:08.234
He has a police radio.
Can you track it?

34:08.300 --> 34:09.400
Yeah. What's
his unit number?

34:09.467 --> 34:11.100
Call the sheriff's station.

34:11.167 --> 34:12.100
Get the serial numbers
from the dispatcher.

34:12.167 --> 34:13.400
Ok, i'll get back to you.

34:13.467 --> 34:15.400
We profiled him
as a hunter.

34:15.467 --> 34:17.067
Well,
now he's the hunted.

34:17.132 --> 34:18.868
He'll go someplace
he feels safe.

34:18.934 --> 34:20.567
Someplace he knows
he can control.

34:20.634 --> 34:21.567
Home?

34:21.634 --> 34:22.900
No, i think a preplanned
location.

34:22.967 --> 34:26.300
Sir, i've got him.
He's heading northbound.

34:26.367 --> 34:27.601
Interstate?

34:27.667 --> 34:28.766
No, he is not
on a road at all.

34:28.833 --> 34:29.868
He's driving through the desert.

34:29.934 --> 34:31.266
Keep tracking him, garcia.

34:31.333 --> 34:32.266
Jj: he's running.

34:32.333 --> 34:33.300
Not home for sure.

34:33.367 --> 34:34.501
He lives in a trailer
out west of town.

34:34.567 --> 34:35.900
So where's
he running to?

34:35.967 --> 34:37.567
Morgan, prentiss, reid...
deputy,

34:37.634 --> 34:39.534
You take them to his house,
see what you can find.

34:39.601 --> 34:41.100
I need your radio.

34:41.167 --> 34:44.033
What are you gonna do?
Keep him busy.

34:44.100 --> 34:48.434
[Over radio] deputy boyd, this
is agent hotchner with the fbi.

34:48.501 --> 34:49.667
I know you can hear me.

34:49.734 --> 34:51.100
You have no place to go.

34:51.167 --> 34:54.434
This is my desert. You think
you can find me out here,

34:54.501 --> 34:56.868
Yeah, well, come on out.

34:56.934 --> 34:57.934
Cocky little bastard.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.067
The trouble is he's right.

34:59.133 --> 35:00.901
We don't know anything
about this desert.

35:00.968 --> 35:02.534
Hope they can find something.

35:14.467 --> 35:17.767
Oh, god. [Coughs]

35:17.834 --> 35:19.501
Morgan: well, we're definitely
in the right place.

35:19.567 --> 35:21.300
Just breathe through
your nose like normal.

35:21.367 --> 35:24.300
Smell is the weakest sense. In a few
more minutes, you won't even notice it.

35:24.367 --> 35:25.968
Prentiss: what about the taste?

35:26.033 --> 35:28.133
I think
that's in your head.

35:28.200 --> 35:29.467
All right, spread out.

35:29.534 --> 35:32.434
Let's find out where
this guy's headed here.

35:32.501 --> 35:34.868
Boyd, this doesn't have to end
any worse than it already is.

35:34.934 --> 35:36.501
Is that right?

35:36.567 --> 35:38.501
Turn yourself in. I'll tell
the judge you cooperated.

35:38.567 --> 35:40.133
This is texas, agent.

35:40.200 --> 35:42.634
You think the judge gives a damn
whether or not someone cooperated

35:42.701 --> 35:44.167
When he's handing out
the death penalty?

35:44.234 --> 35:46.334
Now, don't get me wrong.

35:46.400 --> 35:49.367
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

35:49.434 --> 35:54.300
That's the only way
to deal with someone like me.

35:54.367 --> 35:55.801
You think he's suicidal?

35:55.868 --> 35:57.367
Or he's bluffing.

35:57.434 --> 35:58.701
What's north of here?

35:58.767 --> 36:00.534
A whole lot of nothing.

36:00.601 --> 36:02.167
He's not panicking.

36:02.234 --> 36:04.334
There's something out there,
and he's headed for it.

36:07.567 --> 36:09.234
Oh, god. [Coughs]

36:09.300 --> 36:13.167
I found where the source of
that smell is coming from.

36:13.234 --> 36:14.901
Ohh...

36:17.901 --> 36:19.767
Oh, my god.

36:19.834 --> 36:23.434
Well, this is where
he decapitated them.

36:23.501 --> 36:25.434
Reid: guys, come look at this.

36:25.501 --> 36:29.567
I'm ready for that smell
weakness to kick in anytime, reid.

36:29.634 --> 36:31.968
Listen. "Golden harvest
grain and feed

36:32.033 --> 36:33.801
"Suffered another
setback today

36:33.868 --> 36:37.200
In a ruling over the death
of foreman fred boyd."

36:38.367 --> 36:40.734
"Boyd survived
by his son ronald."

36:40.801 --> 36:44.734
Didn't the last victim's child say
that he saw the sun when he crossed?

36:44.801 --> 36:45.834
Yeah.

36:45.901 --> 36:47.934
Golden harvest,
that's out north of town.

37:02.601 --> 37:04.968
Sir, i...i lost him.
The signal's gone.

37:05.033 --> 37:06.901
He smashed the radio.

37:06.968 --> 37:09.767
Garcia, i need a satellite photo of
the last place that the signal showed.

37:09.834 --> 37:12.400
There's something out there
that's not on the map.

37:12.467 --> 37:13.434
Yes, sir, i'm already
working on that.

37:13.501 --> 37:15.367
Let's head north.

37:16.534 --> 37:19.300
Hotch, there's an old
grain and feed barn

37:19.367 --> 37:21.601
North of town
called golden harvest.

37:21.667 --> 37:23.801
Boyd's father was killed there.

37:23.868 --> 37:26.234
Garcia's searching for
an exact address right now.

37:26.300 --> 37:27.767
Ok, right.
We'll see you there.

37:27.834 --> 37:29.100
His victims.

37:32.367 --> 37:34.467
Reid, i want you to stay with
the crime scene, all right?

37:34.534 --> 37:36.467
I'll call the state
and local bureau offices.

37:36.534 --> 37:38.100
They'll be here
as soon as they can.

37:48.267 --> 37:50.400
Try not to shoot that
inside the car.

37:50.467 --> 37:52.367
You mean try not
to deafen you?

37:52.434 --> 37:53.534
Exactly.

37:56.934 --> 37:58.734
There's his vehicle.

38:06.701 --> 38:10.667
You take the side door.
I'll take the front.

38:14.033 --> 38:15.334
Watch the windows up top.

38:25.501 --> 38:28.167
[Gunfire]

38:28.234 --> 38:30.167
[Shouts]

38:37.367 --> 38:39.534
Do you have a shot?

38:39.601 --> 38:40.634
I can't see anything.

38:40.701 --> 38:43.200
[Engine revving]

38:46.901 --> 38:48.868
I got him, i got him.
Prentiss, look out!

39:01.567 --> 39:03.033
You all right?
Morgan: yeah!

39:03.100 --> 39:04.200
No!

39:04.267 --> 39:05.634
Are you
out of your mind?

39:05.701 --> 39:06.968
You blew out
my eardrum.

39:07.033 --> 39:08.200
What did you want me to do?
He was coming right at us.

39:08.267 --> 39:09.734
I told you i had him.

39:09.801 --> 39:11.400
He was shooting at us,
emily.

39:11.467 --> 39:13.534
Well, you could have
given me a heads-Up.

39:13.601 --> 39:17.000
The loaded mp-5 and the lunatic
shooting at us wasn't enough? Come on.

39:26.400 --> 39:29.000
Hotch: the state's sending out
a crime scene team.

39:29.067 --> 39:30.601
Rossi: it's going to be hard
to identify the bodies

39:30.667 --> 39:32.701
With out missing persons
reports.

39:32.767 --> 39:35.000
I called that advocate,
richard corral.

39:35.067 --> 39:37.200
He's contacting families
with missing relatives.

39:37.267 --> 39:39.300
He's gonna try and get
some dna.

39:39.367 --> 39:40.300
Hotch: that'll help.

39:40.367 --> 39:42.133
This is a mess.

39:42.200 --> 39:45.200
Hotch: it would have been a
bigger mess without sheriff ruiz,

39:45.267 --> 39:46.868
And it would still
be happening.

39:46.934 --> 39:48.200
Did she have any family?

39:48.267 --> 39:49.901
I already have garcia
checking into it.

39:51.033 --> 39:52.467
I'm going to call
brooklyn homicide,

39:52.534 --> 39:53.801
Talk to some of the guys
i know there.

39:53.868 --> 39:55.133
They'll honor her shield.

39:55.200 --> 39:58.567
That's good. An ex-Nypd
detective would like that.

40:03.868 --> 40:05.634
Let's go home.

40:13.534 --> 40:15.133
Hotch: "many persons
have the wrong idea

40:15.200 --> 40:17.300
"Of what constitutes
true happiness.

40:17.367 --> 40:19.467
"It is not attained
through self-Gratification

40:19.534 --> 40:22.334
But through fidelity
to a worthy purpose."

40:22.400 --> 40:24.000
Helen keller.
