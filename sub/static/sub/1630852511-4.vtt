I'm, like, you're gonna say it
to Chris' face, really?

08:14.328 --> 08:15.961
<i> - He's little [bleep] pussy.</i>

08:16.029 --> 08:17.462
<i> Wish I was there</i>
<i> to [bleep] smack him.</i>

08:17.531 --> 08:19.798
- You might think I'm a scumbag
and whatever,

08:19.867 --> 08:21.066
but when you said "snake,"

08:21.134 --> 08:22.467
that's a little [bleep]
up to even say that.

08:22.536 --> 08:24.069
- Can we just eat
and not fight?

08:24.137 --> 08:25.971
- Shut the fuck up.
- That's my opinion.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.806
<i> - Can we have the check?</i>

08:29.476 --> 08:30.408

08:33.914 --> 08:36.681
- So Vinny has
something to say.

08:36.750 --> 08:39.017
- I don't have my house
anymore.

08:39.086 --> 08:41.186
I actually sold my house.

08:41.255 --> 08:44.923
<i> [tense music]</i>

08:44.992 --> 08:47.526
- I don't know whether
to congratulate you

08:47.594 --> 08:48.693
or to punch you in the face.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.328
When the [bleep]
are you going home?

08:50.397 --> 08:51.730
- I'm leaving tonight.

08:51.798 --> 08:52.831
- Home tomorrow?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.766
- I wanted to see
you guys in Jersey.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.668
I was gonna come knock
on your door and be, like,

08:56.737 --> 08:57.802
"Hey, guys.
Surprise. I'm back".

08:57.871 --> 08:59.070
- "I'm home."

08:59.139 --> 09:00.772
Honestly, I can't
even process it right now,

09:00.841 --> 09:02.307
because I'm so delusional.

09:02.376 --> 09:05.310
I think I'm actually in a dream
and I'm still in New Jersey

09:05.379 --> 09:09.314
<i> sleeping peacefully in my bed</i>
<i> and this is all dream.</i>

09:09.383 --> 09:11.616
- It's one day in LA.
Now that you guys are here,

09:11.685 --> 09:13.785
we're gonna have a fun day.
We're gonna go to hiking.

09:13.854 --> 09:15.420
- Who the [bleep]
wants go hiking?

09:15.489 --> 09:16.821
- Lookit, this girl's
in full hair

09:16.890 --> 09:18.523
and makeup hiking gear
right now.

09:18.592 --> 09:19.791
- Listen...
- Who the [bleep] wants to go

09:19.860 --> 09:23.562
hiking after being
on an 11-hour delay?

09:23.630 --> 09:25.263
So happy, Vinny.

09:25.332 --> 09:29.434
So how was dinner?

09:29.503 --> 09:31.303
- It was actually very--
- Oh, it was wonderful.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.004
It was the typical...

09:33.073 --> 09:34.172
- You throw a drink?

09:34.241 --> 09:35.407
both: No.
- You were annoying.

09:35.475 --> 09:36.708
- No, you were annoyed,
and you were.

09:36.777 --> 09:37.709
- Stop trying to make it
like you had no--

09:37.778 --> 09:38.877
- They were fighting about

09:38.946 --> 09:40.078
what she had brought up
at the dinner.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.613
- Yes.
- Did you lie about that?

09:41.682 --> 09:43.982
- You've said a million things
about me that you brought to--

09:44.051 --> 09:45.617
- We did this last night.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.785
- You have the right to say
whatever you want.

09:46.853 --> 09:47.919
- So, so, so--

09:47.988 --> 09:49.254
- But now I don't
[bleep] with you.

09:49.323 --> 09:50.589
You lost me as, like,
a good friend.

09:50.657 --> 09:54.426
- Okay, well, then I don't
[bleep] with you then.

09:54.494 --> 09:57.195
You're so annoying.
I can't. Don't start with me.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.563
- This was last night?
- I didn't start with you.

09:58.632 --> 09:59.998
You started with me.
- No, you're starting with me.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.333
- You started with me when
you brought that [bleep] up.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.368
Because every action
has a reaction.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.370
- That's my line.
- Give me that other top.

10:05.439 --> 10:07.038
- That's your line?
- That's what I say.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.907
- I'm pretty sure that's Albert
Einstein's line or something.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.275
- Oh, okay.
- It's called physics.

10:10.344 --> 10:12.310
- We're in the social studies
book now. I forgot.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.179
- Equal and opposite reactions.

10:14.247 --> 10:15.780
- I forgot.
- Ahh!

10:15.849 --> 10:17.582
- Oh, [bleep].
- Enough!

10:17.651 --> 10:18.717
I feel like my Chris

10:18.785 --> 10:20.885
might be having an easier time
this week

10:20.954 --> 10:23.588
in taking care of the two boys
than I'm going

10:23.657 --> 10:25.857
to be taking care
of friggin' Vinnie and Angelina

10:25.926 --> 10:27.425
this entire weekend.

10:27.494 --> 10:28.493
We have things to do.
- And then you walk in here

10:28.562 --> 10:29.761
and started with me.

10:29.830 --> 10:30.996
- Angelina...

10:31.064 --> 10:32.931
<i> - You start.</i>
<i> You open yourself up.</i>

10:33.000 --> 10:34.165
- Oh, come on.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.334
- Yo, I didn't say it.
- Yeah, you did.

10:36.403 --> 10:37.702
- You're shooting the messenger
right now?

10:37.771 --> 10:38.970
- Yeah, I am shooting
the messenger,

10:39.039 --> 10:40.772
'cause the messenger
is the only thing here.

10:40.841 --> 10:44.075
Because without you,
there was no rumor, bro.

10:44.144 --> 10:46.911
- I'm taking a nap.
Figure out your [bleep]

10:46.980 --> 10:49.414
Wake me up when it's over.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.782
- [Bleep] knee in your balls.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.417
- You're eating his balls?

10:52.486 --> 10:55.286
- I don't condone any violence.
- [Bleep].

10:55.355 --> 10:57.389
- You know I would
dominate you in bed.

10:57.457 --> 10:59.557
- Who the [bleep] says that?

10:59.626 --> 11:02.127
- This is too much for me.

11:02.195 --> 11:04.829

<i> - Hey, what's up guys?</i>
<i> What are you up to?</i>

11:07.200 --> 11:10.068
- Hey.
- I actually just got here.

11:10.137 --> 11:12.570
Why are we at The London,
Vinny?

11:12.639 --> 11:14.005
- We're all leaving tonight

11:14.074 --> 11:16.141
to go back to the East Coast,
because I sold--

11:16.209 --> 11:17.308
<i> - Stop it.</i>

11:17.377 --> 11:18.777
- I sold my house,
and I'm coming home.

11:18.845 --> 11:19.911
<i> - Oh, damn. Already?</i>

11:19.980 --> 11:21.646
- Yo, money talks, bro.
I got the offer.

11:21.715 --> 11:23.181
I said you guys
do whatever you want.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.282
- Vinny. Vinny, Vinny.

11:24.351 --> 11:25.717
- It would have
been nice to know.

11:25.786 --> 11:28.286
Vinny should have said he sold
his house in group chat

11:28.355 --> 11:30.689
and then poof, trip canceled.

11:30.757 --> 11:31.956
- All right, Mike,
we'll talk to you later.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.091
- Bye, Mike. Love you.
- All right, bye.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.926
- Bye, Mike. Love you.

get some things for hiking,

11:36.863 --> 11:38.229
make sure you guys
gotta stay hydrated.

11:38.298 --> 11:39.698
You look beautiful.
You're ready for--

11:39.766 --> 11:40.799
- Oh, thank you. Thanks, sweet.

11:40.867 --> 11:42.200
- You're ready to go
for the hike.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.201
I'll meet you in the hallway
in, like, five minutes.

11:43.270 --> 11:44.402
- Bye.
- All right.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.770
- All right, snake.

11:49.242 --> 11:51.209

He said he really got nothing
out of confronting her.

that Angeliners and her
husband,

13:50.797 --> 13:52.463

22:53.005 --> 22:54.839
Now he knows
what it feels like.

22:54.907 --> 22:57.475
Last night at dinner
Vinny was like, "You guys--

22:57.543 --> 22:59.143
"you and your husband,

22:59.212 --> 23:00.845
"you guys made up
a rumor about me.

23:00.913 --> 23:04.482
You both are snakes, and now
I don't [bleep] with you both."

23:04.550 --> 23:07.351
<i> - He's a little [bleep] pussy.</i>
<i> Put him on the phone.</i>

23:07.420 --> 23:08.719

23:08.788 --> 23:10.254

23:13.259 --> 23:14.692

<i> [inaudible] [bleep].</i>

23:14.761 --> 23:16.627

<i> about me, well, guess what.</i>

23:16.696 --> 23:20.264
<i> Now on don't talk about me</i>
<i> or my wife anymore.</i>

23:20.333 --> 23:21.465

23:21.534 --> 23:23.067
<i> With the way</i>
<i> he sounds right now,</i>

23:23.136 --> 23:25.669
I'm actually scared for Vinny.

23:25.738 --> 23:27.138
- Babe, he was like,
"You both are snakes."

23:27.206 --> 23:28.939
And then I'm wearing that--that
snake outfit. He's like,

23:29.008 --> 23:31.742
"Oh, look, you're dressed
perfect for the part. A snake

23:31.811 --> 23:33.511

23:33.579 --> 23:35.379
- No, listen, I knew it.

23:35.448 --> 23:37.448
As soon as he called
Chris a snake,

23:37.517 --> 23:38.916
I knew Chris
was gonna flip out.

23:38.985 --> 23:40.618
- He was like, "You and your
husband are [bleep] snakes,

23:40.686 --> 23:42.253
and I'm gonna say it
to your husband's face."

23:42.321 --> 23:43.954
I'm like, "You're gonna say it
to Chris' face? Really?"

23:44.023 --> 23:46.457
<i> - Tell him to get</i>
<i> a ladder first.</i>

23:46.526 --> 23:47.558
- Okay--
- He did say that.

23:47.627 --> 23:48.993
- So here's the deal.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.562
I do think that Chris and Vinny
need to talk in person...

23:51.631 --> 23:52.997
- See?
- 'Cause that's not gonna be

23:53.065 --> 23:54.165

23:54.233 --> 23:56.600
Listen, I know all about
stirring the pot,

23:56.669 --> 23:58.769

the book on it.

23:58.838 --> 24:02.239

24:02.308 --> 24:04.074

37:55.440 --> 37:56.706
- I don't give a [bleep].
- You're being a dick now.

37:56.775 --> 37:58.241
- That's--but that's the truth.
- All right.

37:58.310 --> 38:00.410
Vinny has no respect for me,
and I'm so sick

38:00.479 --> 38:02.145
and tired of him
treating me like this.

38:02.214 --> 38:03.613
Like, I cannot take it anymore.

38:03.682 --> 38:05.215
We had a decent conversation
yesterday.

38:05.284 --> 38:06.549
Now it turned into [bleep].

38:06.618 --> 38:09.386
- You and Chris now did that
to me, and it's sad,

38:09.454 --> 38:10.920
because you're not
my friends anymore.

38:10.989 --> 38:12.289
- You're a [bleep] idiot.
Shut up.

38:12.357 --> 38:13.423
- See you on the East Coast.
- Bye, Pauly.

38:13.492 --> 38:14.824
- Bye, Pauly. Love you.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.526
- Oh, my God.
Are you kidding me?

38:16.595 --> 38:18.795
- Y'all about to start
really beefing, huh?

38:18.864 --> 38:20.230
- You're being a dick
right now.

38:20.299 --> 38:21.331
- How? 'Cause I'm right?

38:21.400 --> 38:22.365
- Because no, you're not
[bleep] right.

38:22.434 --> 38:23.733
- You didn't spread a rumor

38:23.802 --> 38:24.734
- I'm not gonna--I'm not gonna
put up with your [bleep]

38:24.803 --> 38:25.735
gaslighting [bleep].

38:25.804 --> 38:26.970
- You didn't spread a rumor?

38:27.039 --> 38:29.005
- Can we buy the people
behind us drinks?

38:29.074 --> 38:30.273
- I didn't spread a rumor
of that.

38:30.342 --> 38:31.441
- Yes, you did. You spread it.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.442
You didn't start it;
you spread it.

38:32.511 --> 38:33.510
- Ma'am.

38:33.578 --> 38:34.778
- You wanna go making
up--making

38:34.846 --> 38:35.945
up crazy lies about me.

38:36.014 --> 38:37.547
- This is a very classy place.

38:37.616 --> 38:38.882
- You talk [bleep] to me
all the time.

38:38.950 --> 38:40.984
- Can we buy them a round
behind us?

38:41.053 --> 38:42.652
- Vinny, you [bleep] talk down
to me all the time

38:42.721 --> 38:43.653
like I'm a piece of [bleep].
- Is that spreading a rumor?

38:43.722 --> 38:45.622
- Something nice. Thank you.

38:45.691 --> 38:47.090
- [Bleep] you. I had
no [bleep] respect for you.

38:47.159 --> 38:48.124
- So if that's how
you wanna play.

38:48.193 --> 38:49.693
- How about that?
- Jesus Christ.

38:49.761 --> 38:52.629
<i> - ♪ Smoked so much</i>
<i> that I can't even focus ♪</i>

38:52.698 --> 38:55.432
<i> ♪ I'm so lit that I can't</i>
<i> even focus ♪</i>

38:55.500 --> 38:56.900
- So much drama, man.
- What?

38:56.968 --> 38:58.835
- So I just got off with Vinny.
Remember Angelina

38:58.904 --> 39:00.437
and Chris made up
that crazy rumor about Vinny?

39:00.505 --> 39:01.438
- Yeah.

39:01.506 --> 39:02.772
- He's annoyed.
- Yeah.

39:02.841 --> 39:03.973
- All this he said,
she said crap,

39:04.042 --> 39:05.241
and it's, like, what the hell?

39:05.310 --> 39:06.576
I'm pissed that Chris
for being pissed at Vinny

39:06.645 --> 39:09.612
for being pissed that Angelina.

39:09.681 --> 39:11.448
I think it was [bleep].

39:11.516 --> 39:12.682
But I don't know
what they were trying to do.

39:12.751 --> 39:14.050
- You get mad at me
for other things,

39:14.119 --> 39:15.352
and you--and your payback

39:15.420 --> 39:17.554
is coming on the show
and spreading a rumor?

39:17.622 --> 39:18.822
- It's not payback.

39:18.890 --> 39:19.889
I never spread a [bleep]
crazy rumors about you.

39:19.958 --> 39:20.957
- Yeah, you did.
You and Chris did.

39:21.026 --> 39:22.192
- No, I didn't.

39:22.260 --> 39:23.526
- I just think you're being
really defensive,

39:23.595 --> 39:25.028
because you know
what you did was wrong.

39:25.097 --> 39:26.062
- No.

39:26.131 --> 39:27.230
- I think that Angelina
and Chris

39:27.299 --> 39:29.032
are just really mad
at themselves

39:29.101 --> 39:31.668
and mad at each other,
and I think that they're mad

39:31.737 --> 39:33.336
that they just
got caught lying.

39:33.405 --> 39:35.572
- You are [bleep]
overdramatic.

39:35.640 --> 39:38.141
If it's not true, let it go.

39:38.210 --> 39:41.444
So if you knew it was not true,
why are you so mad?

39:41.513 --> 39:43.079
- This is getting crazy.

39:43.148 --> 39:46.316
All this fighting is ruining
this beautiful view,

39:46.385 --> 39:49.152
this amazing restaurant,
and I'm just ready to go home.

39:49.221 --> 39:50.420
- You're pissing me off, Vinny.

39:50.489 --> 39:51.888
- We have 30 minutes.
- [Bleep] [inaudible].

39:51.957 --> 39:53.790
- Listen, all I know is I said
it out loud. You were MIA.

39:53.859 --> 39:55.325
- Okay, that's my--my opinion
is that's a snake move.

39:55.394 --> 39:56.793
- I thought you were gonna
be there but you weren't there.

39:56.862 --> 39:58.261
I don't give a [bleep]
what you think about.

39:58.330 --> 39:59.763
- Can we just eat
and not fight?

39:59.831 --> 40:00.764
- Shut the [bleep] up.

40:00.832 --> 40:01.765
- Oh.
- That's my opinion.

40:01.833 --> 40:02.966
- [Bleep] shut up.
- Ooh.

40:03.034 --> 40:05.168
- 'Cause I'm sick and tired
of your [bleep].

40:05.237 --> 40:08.238
<i> - It's not a lie. If somebody</i>
<i> made up a rumor about you--</i>

40:08.306 --> 40:09.406
- Which is a lie.

40:09.474 --> 40:10.673
- Which is a lie
but I didn't do that.

40:10.742 --> 40:11.741
- That's it.
- I didn't lie about you.

40:11.810 --> 40:12.809
- That's it.

40:12.878 --> 40:14.411
- You're just
continued the lie.

40:14.479 --> 40:15.612
<i> - It's not spreading rumors.</i>

40:15.680 --> 40:16.880
<i> - No, that's not</i>
<i> spreading rumors?</i>

40:16.948 --> 40:18.081
- We said trip, guys.
- It's a snake move.

40:18.150 --> 40:19.449
- That's not a snake move.
- Yes, it is.

40:19.518 --> 40:20.683
- Let's just all just [bleep]
shut the [bleep] up

40:20.752 --> 40:23.253
and enjoy our last 15 minutes.

40:23.321 --> 40:25.688
<i> - It's not about me doing</i>
<i> something tit for tat.</i>

40:25.757 --> 40:26.790
<i> - You said--</i>
<i> - What the [bleep]?</i>

40:26.858 --> 40:28.425
Are you kidding me?
You're a dick.

40:28.493 --> 40:30.059
- Can we just eat
and not fight?

40:30.128 --> 40:31.795
- I don't understand why you're
taking this out on me.

40:31.863 --> 40:34.164
Don't shoot the messenger
is--is actually irrelevant.

40:34.232 --> 40:35.732
- Tonight we're done.

40:35.801 --> 40:39.068
Let's enjoy the last five
[bleep] minutes, and that's it.

40:39.137 --> 40:40.904
- Give me a break.
- Can we have the check?

40:40.972 --> 40:42.672
- Why?
I got more balls than you?

40:42.741 --> 40:43.807
I got more backbone?
- Maybe you--

40:43.875 --> 40:45.108
- We're done.
- No.

40:45.177 --> 40:47.544
- Shut the [bleep] up.
- Let it go. Let it go!

40:47.612 --> 40:49.012
- [Bleep].

40:49.080 --> 40:52.182
<i> I just need to go home.</i>
<i> Get me on the flight.</i>

40:52.250 --> 40:54.851
<i> - See?</i>

40:56.354 --> 40:57.287
- I have a surprise
about tomorrow.

40:57.355 --> 40:58.421
- What's that?
- Oh, God.

40:58.490 --> 40:59.956
- Okay, they wouldn't
baptize Romeo

41:00.025 --> 41:03.526
if I didn't redo my baptism,
and we're gonna do it tomorrow.

41:03.595 --> 41:06.196
- You're 55.
Like, you didn't get baptized?

41:06.264 --> 41:08.465
- You and hubby are having
real turbulent issues.

41:08.533 --> 41:10.333
<i> - I need some guidance</i>
<i> in my life.</i>

41:10.402 --> 41:11.668
My grandmother said,

41:11.736 --> 41:13.603
"This pet psychic,
maybe she could help you."

41:13.672 --> 41:14.904
- She really doesn't like
Chris.

41:14.973 --> 41:16.072
- And why doesn't she like him?

41:16.141 --> 41:17.974
- 'Cause she don't like her.
- What?

41:18.043 --> 41:19.309
- Hi.
