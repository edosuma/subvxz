00:26.970 --> 00:28.970
which means
perfect weekend weather!

00:29.040 --> 00:30.770
Ugh! Damn it!

00:30.840 --> 00:32.290
So if you think
you hear thunder,

00:32.360 --> 00:33.580
it's just my stomach growling.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.510
Ha!
I love Lobster.

00:35.580 --> 00:36.910
This guy is unbelievable.

00:36.980 --> 00:38.950
Stop pimping for Lobsterfest!

00:39.010 --> 00:41.350
And start <i>primping</i>
for Lobsterfest.

00:41.420 --> 00:42.880
Mmm...

00:42.950 --> 00:44.420
Looking primpy.

00:44.490 --> 00:46.190
No, no primping for anything!

00:46.260 --> 00:48.920
Why are you so
grumpy? Come on.
You know why.

00:48.970 --> 00:51.510
It's no fun being a burger
man in a seafood town.

00:51.580 --> 00:53.180
I hate Lobsters and
their stupid fest.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.710
Plus, I'm allergic.

00:54.780 --> 00:56.480
No, you're not.
Yeah.

00:56.550 --> 00:58.230
I'm allergic.
Remember our first date?

00:58.300 --> 01:00.940
Yeah, I remember our first date.
You were a nervous wreck.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.140
♪ ♪

01:10.160 --> 01:12.130
I was having an allergic
reac... never mind.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.230
Hey, what are you guys
looking at over there?

01:14.300 --> 01:15.770
Um, nothing.

01:15.840 --> 01:17.900
Just pictures of people...
Doing it.

01:17.970 --> 01:19.970
Oh. Hey, wait a minute.
That's not porn.

01:20.040 --> 01:22.690
You brought a Lobsterfest
brochure into this house?

01:22.760 --> 01:25.330
Can we please go this year?
Absolutely not.

01:25.390 --> 01:27.660
Ugh! But there's so much
fun stuff happening.

01:27.710 --> 01:30.920
Unveiling of the world's largest
butter vat, for instance.

01:30.980 --> 01:32.720
The coronation
of the Lobster queen

01:32.790 --> 01:34.650
and her court
of lovely Lobster maidens.

01:34.720 --> 01:38.770
Entertainment by John van
horton & the music extrusion.

01:38.840 --> 01:40.640
Mm. I do love
those guys.

01:40.710 --> 01:43.390
As a matter of fact, gene, you
were conceived to a jvh song.

01:43.460 --> 01:45.360
And I plan to return the favor.

01:45.430 --> 01:48.200
Oh, great. I mean, hi, Hugo.

01:48.270 --> 01:50.000
You know, I couldn't help
but notice, Bob,

01:50.070 --> 01:52.040
uh, yours is the only window
on the street

01:52.100 --> 01:53.470
without a Lobsterfest poster
in it.

01:53.540 --> 01:54.960
Yeah.
Why might that be?

01:55.020 --> 01:56.720
Well, because
Lobsterfest is stupid!

01:56.790 --> 01:58.410
What?
I'll handle this, Ron.

01:58.480 --> 02:00.040
Put the sign up.
It's the law.

02:00.110 --> 02:02.230
-It's the law?
-Martial law.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.430
I'm grand marshal
of the fest this year!

02:04.500 --> 02:06.550
Hugo, such a fancy sash.

02:06.620 --> 02:09.220
You look like sissy spacek
in <i>Carrie.</i> Ha.

02:09.289 --> 02:10.710
Oh, thank you.

02:10.759 --> 02:12.190
But, Hugo,
as a health inspector,

02:12.260 --> 02:13.960
you must know how disgusting
Lobsters are, right?

02:14.030 --> 02:16.110
They're bottom feeders
that eat garbage all day.

02:16.180 --> 02:17.730
Huh, they like garbage?

02:17.800 --> 02:19.330
Then they must eat here!

02:19.400 --> 02:20.680
In your face, Bob.

02:20.730 --> 02:22.350
And now in your window!
Come on, Ron.

02:22.420 --> 02:24.570
Let's make like a Lobster
and get the shell out of here.

02:24.650 --> 02:25.870
All right.

02:29.640 --> 02:32.030
Hey, my two best customers!

02:32.080 --> 02:33.330
Two burgers coming up.

02:33.400 --> 02:34.730
No burgers for me, Bob.

02:34.800 --> 02:36.610
I'm saving my appetite
for Lobsterfest.

02:36.680 --> 02:38.230
None for me either, Bobby.

02:38.280 --> 02:40.650
I just come by to show you
my new Lobster cracker.

02:40.720 --> 02:42.690
Check it out-- titanium
with butter-resistant grips.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.270
It's the one
the astronauts used.

02:44.340 --> 02:45.540
Teddy, you think
the astronauts brought

02:45.610 --> 02:47.140
a Lobster cracker to space?

02:47.210 --> 02:49.130
Yeah. That's what it
says on the box. Look.

02:49.200 --> 02:51.000
"The one the astronauts
used in space!"

02:51.060 --> 02:53.000
I spent $49 on this.

02:53.070 --> 02:55.070
Hey, I bet you kids
are old enough

02:55.130 --> 02:57.250
to crack your own claws
this year, right?

02:57.320 --> 02:58.890
We don't celebrate Lobsterfest.

02:58.950 --> 03:01.240
What?!
We're like Jews on Christmas.

03:01.310 --> 03:03.140
Or Jews for Jesus on hanukkah.

03:03.210 --> 03:04.480
Or me at a lesbian bar.

03:04.540 --> 03:06.480
Last night.

03:06.550 --> 03:08.780
Watched a hockey game
at a lesbian bar, Bob.

03:08.850 --> 03:11.720
It was like I was
invisible. Uh...

03:15.220 --> 03:17.490
And who knows the name
of the delicious paste

03:17.570 --> 03:19.360
that collects here
in the pancreas?

03:19.430 --> 03:20.760
Tomalley!
Correct.

03:20.830 --> 03:23.660
Excuse me, miss labonz?

03:23.730 --> 03:26.100
Yes, Louise.
My family doesn't observe Lobsterfest.

03:26.170 --> 03:29.000
I should be excused
from class, and/or given an a.

03:29.080 --> 03:30.590
Thank you.
Good night.

03:30.640 --> 03:32.340
Louise, I don't normally use
this argument,

03:32.400 --> 03:34.640
but if everyone else
is doing it, you should, too.

03:36.730 --> 03:38.790
Huh. Attention, students.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.600
The tropical storm
has changed course

03:40.660 --> 03:43.010
and has been upgraded
to a hurricane.

03:43.100 --> 03:44.800
It could hit town
at any moment.

03:44.850 --> 03:46.230
Don't worry.

03:46.300 --> 03:48.000
We have an emergency plan.

03:48.070 --> 03:50.040
It's called
"talking it through."

03:50.110 --> 03:52.070
Now, who here thinks
the hurricane was caused

03:52.140 --> 03:53.640
by something bad they did?

03:53.710 --> 03:55.410
What about you, Nicholas?

03:55.480 --> 03:58.010
That thing you told me?
In confidence?

03:59.450 --> 04:01.180
Say it.

04:01.250 --> 04:02.380
I rub my genitals on the couch.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.800
Mm-hmm.

04:03.870 --> 04:05.570
We're all gonna die
because of you!

04:07.360 --> 04:09.820
It's weather
only a Lobster could love,

04:09.890 --> 04:12.940
but sadly,
there will be no Lobsterfest.

04:13.010 --> 04:15.900
This reporter
is getting his bib off.

04:15.970 --> 04:18.649
Ha, ha! Stupid,
failure weatherman,

04:18.720 --> 04:20.870
and your failed Lobsterfest.

04:20.940 --> 04:23.340
Where's your ugly
red sea bug God now?!

04:24.790 --> 04:26.340
All right, hold hands.

04:26.410 --> 04:28.140
Come on, down to the basement.

04:28.210 --> 04:29.440
Bob, we have to close.

04:29.510 --> 04:30.860
A hurricane is coming!

04:30.930 --> 04:32.710
I know. Isn't it great?

04:32.780 --> 04:34.820
Lobsterfest is cancelled!

04:34.880 --> 04:37.740
So this town is gonna be
crawling with empty bellies

04:37.800 --> 04:40.310
ready to eat
Bob's burgers, baby!

04:40.370 --> 04:41.720
Bob, you're crazy.

04:41.790 --> 04:43.860
I think you're crazy!

04:43.930 --> 04:46.660
'Cause it's crazy <i>not</i> to sell
burgers during a hurricane!

04:46.710 --> 04:49.230
Bob's burgers is open
for business!

04:49.300 --> 04:50.630
Oh.

04:52.690 --> 04:55.640
Is that all you got, storm?

04:55.700 --> 04:57.760
Wind chimes! Aah!

05:03.580 --> 05:06.070
Bob, I'm not sure
staying open is safe.

05:06.140 --> 05:08.170
Suppose the hurricane tears
right through here.

05:08.240 --> 05:09.950
I'll chance it!

05:10.020 --> 05:12.970
Look who I found trying
to stay dry in the bounce house.

05:13.030 --> 05:15.160
The entire royal court
of Lobster maidens.

05:15.230 --> 05:17.300
Oh, you poor things!

05:17.360 --> 05:18.930
Welcome, your highnesseses.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.870
Uh, you are henceforth
known as the royal cows.

05:21.930 --> 05:23.430
Bob!

05:23.500 --> 05:25.320
Ah, well, something
like that.

05:25.370 --> 05:26.900
I'll go throw on some burgers.

05:26.990 --> 05:28.740
Hot coffee coming up!

05:28.820 --> 05:31.230
I'd really rather get my lips
around that beer tap.

05:31.290 --> 05:33.560
Hi, guys.
Hey, Gretchen!

05:33.630 --> 05:35.410
Hi!
Oh, Lobster maiden!

05:35.480 --> 05:37.920
Teddy, this is Gretchen.

05:37.980 --> 05:39.830
She cuts my hair.
How you doing?

05:39.890 --> 05:42.070
Hey, are you still working
nights at the cop bar?

05:42.140 --> 05:44.320
Nah, there was a groping incident.

05:44.390 --> 05:47.140
I apologized, but they fired me
anyway.

05:47.210 --> 05:49.460
Oh, she's too much.
Really is.

05:49.530 --> 05:51.310
Hey, you open?
Mm-hmm.

05:51.380 --> 05:53.160
You got food?
Yup.

05:53.230 --> 05:54.720
Beer?
Absolutely!

05:54.780 --> 05:55.750
Atmosphere?

05:55.820 --> 05:57.840
Yeah... nnnn... eh...

05:57.900 --> 05:59.800
Ah, good enough.
Whoa, Bobby.

05:59.870 --> 06:02.510
I think this might develop
into a party type situation!

06:02.570 --> 06:05.080
You kids stay down
in the basement.

06:05.140 --> 06:06.740
I already picked a
corner for the bathroom.

06:06.810 --> 06:08.150
That one, where I went.

06:08.210 --> 06:09.580
And I picked that corner.

06:09.650 --> 06:10.950
Hey, we've got two bathrooms!

06:11.020 --> 06:12.400
Mom, I'm coming up!

06:12.470 --> 06:14.200
Just stay down there.

06:14.270 --> 06:16.140
They're gonna need you
to help repopulate the earth

06:16.210 --> 06:17.670
when this is all over.

06:17.740 --> 06:19.910
Ew! You want us to mate
with each other?!

06:19.980 --> 06:21.890
No, you'll mate
with the other kids

06:21.960 --> 06:23.290
in other basements.

06:23.360 --> 06:24.350
Keep talking.

06:24.410 --> 06:25.960
All right!

06:26.050 --> 06:27.520
Jvh unplugged!

06:27.580 --> 06:29.270
Look at all that wet gray hair.

06:29.350 --> 06:30.850
Oh, Bobby, look at Hugo.

06:30.920 --> 06:33.450
Oh, and poor wet Ron.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.310
Yeah. Isn't it hilarious?
Bobby.

06:35.370 --> 06:36.870
All right, I'll let 'em in.

06:36.940 --> 06:38.390
I just want to give
'em a pressed ham first.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.780
Stop it!
Come on, let me.

06:39.860 --> 06:40.700
All right.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.470
Sorry for using
all of your napkins.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.020
I want to thank you
for bringing us in, Bob.

06:47.090 --> 06:48.640
It was totally Linda's idea.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.200
She is so damn considerate!

06:50.270 --> 06:51.910
You have everything,
and I have nothing.

06:51.970 --> 06:53.420
God, so alone!

06:53.490 --> 06:54.790
Mm.

06:54.860 --> 06:56.240
Lobsterfest was all I had.

06:56.300 --> 06:57.550
And now that's gone, too.

06:57.610 --> 06:59.010
Look at me.
I'm a joke!

06:59.080 --> 07:00.580
Yeah, that's too bad.

07:00.650 --> 07:02.750
Hey, Bobby, some of the
Lobster maidens are open

07:02.820 --> 07:04.620
to the idea of a
wet gown contest.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.020
Want to put up a prize?

07:06.090 --> 07:07.470
Uh, how about a towel?

07:07.560 --> 07:09.040
Ha! Oh, my God.
That's so funny.

07:10.660 --> 07:12.290
Gretchen, have you,
uh, met Hugo?

07:12.360 --> 07:14.700
He was gonna be grand marshal
at, uh, Lobsterfest.

07:14.760 --> 07:16.660
Ooh. Nice sash.

07:16.730 --> 07:18.050
Ever take it off?

07:18.120 --> 07:19.550
Well, actually, on Monday,

07:19.620 --> 07:21.550
I have to dry-clean it
and give it back.

07:21.620 --> 07:23.800
Uh, Hugo, Gretchen is into
authority figures.

07:23.870 --> 07:25.890
Cops, firemen, even mailmen,

07:25.960 --> 07:27.260
if they have
an important route.

07:27.330 --> 07:28.660
Oh, my gosh. So am I!

07:28.730 --> 07:30.190
What, you're into mailmen?

07:30.260 --> 07:31.900
Well, if they have
an important route.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.950
I think what Bob's saying is,
she likes a man with a badge.

07:35.020 --> 07:36.630
You have a badge.
Hey, Gretchen!

07:36.700 --> 07:39.150
Huh?
Hey, Hugo's also a health inspector.

07:39.220 --> 07:41.040
That's like being
a food sheriff.

07:41.110 --> 07:42.620
This is my badge.

07:42.690 --> 07:44.060
Mm. Kind of small.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.460
You got a gun?

07:45.530 --> 07:47.330
Uh, no. Actually,
I'm not, uh...

07:47.400 --> 07:49.260
Mm.
...Licensed to carry a firearm.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.730
I do have a food safety
thermometer,

07:50.800 --> 07:52.430
and it's very sharp.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.340
Pull it out, Hugo.
Yeah, pull it out, Hugo.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.090
Whoa! Watch out.

07:56.150 --> 07:57.420
Here it is.

08:30.660 --> 08:32.140
Looting?!

08:32.210 --> 08:35.010
So how do we do
this looting thing exactly?

08:35.059 --> 08:36.429
It's easy.

08:36.500 --> 08:38.659
You grab anything
that's not nailed down.

08:38.730 --> 08:40.299
Anything?
Like this brick?

08:40.370 --> 08:42.600
It's yours.
Free brick!

08:42.669 --> 08:43.620
Free quarter.

08:43.690 --> 08:44.650
Free phone numbers.

08:44.720 --> 08:45.790
Free seaweed.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.590
Gene, free plywood.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.110
Whee!

08:49.190 --> 08:51.230
Hey, Bob, the cash register
won't open,

08:51.290 --> 08:52.940
and you're serving burgers
so fast,

08:53.030 --> 08:55.450
I don't even know
who to get an iou from.

08:55.530 --> 08:57.300
Relax, Linda. I'll take care of it.
Ugh.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.730
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
listen up, listen up.

08:59.800 --> 09:01.740
You're all my friends.

09:01.800 --> 09:04.810
And friends
don't charge friends.

09:04.870 --> 09:06.510
The burgers are free, people!

09:06.580 --> 09:08.130
Everything is gonna be free!

09:08.210 --> 09:10.480
Bob, I thought the point
of staying open

09:10.550 --> 09:12.550
during a hurricane
was to make money!

09:12.600 --> 09:15.170
This is way more
important than money, lin!

09:15.230 --> 09:17.200
Lobsterfest is dead.

09:17.270 --> 09:18.970
Bobsterfest killed it!

09:19.040 --> 09:20.350
Long live Bobsterfest!

09:22.440 --> 09:24.640
Looting is hard.

09:24.710 --> 09:26.360
Ah, I think
I'm getting loot glutes.

09:26.430 --> 09:27.780
This stuff sucks.

09:27.860 --> 09:30.200
Let's go home.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.970
Hello.

09:32.030 --> 09:33.470
What have we here?

09:33.540 --> 09:35.000
Maybe he's lost.

09:35.070 --> 09:36.500
Check his collar.

09:36.570 --> 09:38.420
Get him, gene!

09:38.490 --> 09:41.030
Looks like this little guy
got into some office supplies.

09:41.090 --> 09:43.380
Yeah, those rubber bands
don't look comfortable.

09:43.450 --> 09:44.960
You should take 'em off.

09:45.050 --> 09:46.560
Aah!

09:46.630 --> 09:48.600
This is our one chance to see

09:48.670 --> 09:50.100
What everyone else
is talking about.

09:50.170 --> 09:51.400
- What do you mean?
- Aah!

09:51.470 --> 09:53.250
We're gonna eat
Lobster tonight!

09:53.310 --> 09:55.610
But that goes against everything
we were raised to believe in!

09:55.670 --> 09:57.510
Aah!
It doesn't go against everything.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.530
Okay, but it's a start.
Aah!

09:59.590 --> 10:02.560
Now's our chance
to taste the forbidden fruit

10:02.630 --> 10:05.070
that has been kept from us
our whole lives.

10:05.130 --> 10:06.770
Are you with me?
Yeah!

10:06.840 --> 10:08.440
Okay.

10:08.500 --> 10:11.840
And one man's generosity
has turned Lobsterfest

10:11.910 --> 10:13.990
into bobsterfest.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.230
We're trying to get a word
with Bob himself here.

10:16.290 --> 10:19.150
I love you, Scott bags!

10:19.210 --> 10:20.770
Yeah, there's a cable on that.

10:20.830 --> 10:21.900
You can't go all
the way over there.

10:21.970 --> 10:23.030
You come with me!
Yeah, okay.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.470
You come with me!

10:24.540 --> 10:25.650
Can I... can I get
my mic back, please?

10:25.720 --> 10:27.790
You come up and get it.
Give me the mic!

10:27.860 --> 10:28.720
Bob! Bob! Bob...!

10:28.790 --> 10:30.170
Whoa! Oh, wow!

10:30.240 --> 10:31.410
This feels weird!

10:31.480 --> 10:32.990
Hey, bro.

10:33.060 --> 10:35.460
Did I hook you up or what, Hugo?

10:37.100 --> 10:38.930
Hey, where are we going now?
Over here?

10:39.000 --> 10:40.730
Who decides which way we go?

10:40.800 --> 10:42.190
There's Linda, my wife!

10:42.270 --> 10:45.010
Hey, Linda, you look mad.

10:45.060 --> 10:46.520
Let's go the other way.

10:46.590 --> 10:49.160
Turn around. Bye, Linda.

10:51.630 --> 10:53.500
How you feeling, Bob?

10:53.570 --> 10:55.230
What?

10:55.300 --> 10:56.700
Oh, my God. Lin!

10:56.770 --> 10:58.250
The restaurant's destroyed.

10:58.320 --> 11:00.420
The hurricane swept right
through here-- we got hit!

11:00.490 --> 11:02.460
Actually,
the hurricane missed us, Bob.

11:02.520 --> 11:04.120
It's beautiful out.

11:06.030 --> 11:08.310
<i>You</i> were the
hurricane, schmuck!

11:11.580 --> 11:13.420
Hey, Gretchen.

11:13.490 --> 11:15.170
Do you have some sweat pants
I can put on?

11:20.290 --> 11:22.340
Uh... Linda.
I don't feel well.

11:22.400 --> 11:25.010
I can't even look at you.
I don't feel well.

11:25.070 --> 11:27.340
I did this?
You and the mob you incited

11:27.410 --> 11:29.180
with free beer and burgers.

11:29.240 --> 11:31.750
Oh, who bent my
little spindle thing?

11:31.810 --> 11:33.430
<i>That's</i> what you notice?!

11:33.500 --> 11:34.970
Okay, lin, it looks bad now,

11:35.030 --> 11:37.800
but we made a lot of
new friends last night.

11:37.870 --> 11:39.740
Once word spreads
that Bob needs help,

11:39.800 --> 11:41.510
this place will
be jammed again.

11:41.570 --> 11:43.810
The biggest problem is
gonna be finding a job

11:43.880 --> 11:45.480
for everybody who wants one.

11:45.540 --> 11:48.210
Gee, I'm worried about this;
I really love it.

11:48.280 --> 11:51.850
♪ ♪

11:51.920 --> 11:54.330
Okay, technical problems from last night

11:54.400 --> 11:56.020
have been resolved.

11:56.090 --> 12:00.070
Hair dryer plus waffle iron
plus toaster equals

12:00.140 --> 12:01.760
boiling water.
So how do we

12:01.830 --> 12:03.480
kill this guy
before we boil him?

12:03.540 --> 12:05.050
We could teach
the Lobster to drive

12:05.110 --> 12:06.950
and wait until
it gets into an accident.

12:07.020 --> 12:09.350
<i>Or</i> we could hire an assassin.
No, idiots,

12:09.420 --> 12:11.920
you boil Lobsters alive.

12:11.990 --> 12:14.000
What?!
That doesn't sound right.

12:14.070 --> 12:15.390
Yep. Until he's dead.

12:15.460 --> 12:17.340
And then we boil him some more.

12:17.390 --> 12:18.610
Here we go.

12:18.680 --> 12:20.680
Wait, this does not feel right.

12:20.730 --> 12:23.480
Doing it in a dark room with
toilet paper around my neck?

12:23.550 --> 12:26.370
I thought my first time
eating Lobster would be special.

12:26.430 --> 12:29.320
And now please join Mr. and Mrs. Jimmy junior

12:29.390 --> 12:32.020
as they eat their first Lobster!

12:32.070 --> 12:33.310
Mmm, mmm...

12:33.370 --> 12:34.840
I thought my first time
eating Lobster

12:34.910 --> 12:36.630
would be different, too.

12:36.690 --> 12:38.650
Gene! Gene!

12:38.710 --> 12:41.010
They're waiting for you
in the hot tub, gene.

12:41.080 --> 12:42.370
Excellent!

12:42.430 --> 12:43.350
Whee!

12:45.240 --> 12:48.820
And the next day do it again--
same songs, different Lobsters.

12:48.890 --> 12:50.560
What's the matter with you two?

12:50.630 --> 12:52.390
Come on, Louise,
is this really how

12:52.460 --> 12:53.630
you imagined your first time?

12:53.700 --> 12:54.760
Yes.

12:54.830 --> 12:57.410
Okay, not quite.

12:57.470 --> 12:59.200
<i>Louise, today</i>

12:59.270 --> 13:01.570
you pay the super price

13:01.640 --> 13:03.070
for your super crimes.

13:03.140 --> 13:05.570
Enjoy your last meal.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.770
It'll do just fine...

13:06.840 --> 13:07.940
In a pinch!

13:08.010 --> 13:10.610
Aah...!

13:10.700 --> 13:12.930
Maybe we <i>have</i>
been rushing things.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.410
I want to wait till I'm ready.

13:14.480 --> 13:15.580
Let's not give in
to peer pressure.

13:15.650 --> 13:17.020
Let's release the Lobster

13:17.090 --> 13:19.550
back into the supermarket
from whence he came!

13:19.620 --> 13:20.620
I guess you're right.

13:20.710 --> 13:22.160
Looks like this guy'll be

13:22.220 --> 13:23.740
the one that
got a... whoa! Woops!

13:23.810 --> 13:26.080
I guess we're having Lobster.

13:26.140 --> 13:27.190
It was meant to be.

13:27.260 --> 13:28.760
When you get married,

13:28.830 --> 13:31.210
just pretend it's your
first time eating Lobster.

13:31.280 --> 13:33.180
No problem.

13:33.250 --> 13:35.020
Down it comes!
This stunning butter sculpture,

13:35.090 --> 13:36.720
the likeness of Julia child,

13:36.790 --> 13:39.520
was made from every available
stick and pat of butter

13:39.590 --> 13:42.130
within the local
and outlying communities. Oh!

13:42.190 --> 13:43.530
And there goes Julia's feet!

13:43.590 --> 13:45.800
What?!
Lobsterfest is back on?

13:45.860 --> 13:48.010
Hey, guys, um, you're not going

13:48.080 --> 13:50.070
to Lobsterfest, are you?

13:50.130 --> 13:51.500
Uh...
Uh...

13:51.570 --> 13:53.570
I'm in kind of a bind, fellas.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.810
There's a mailbox in the middle of
my restaurant.

13:55.870 --> 13:57.720
Oh! Can you mail
this for me?

13:57.790 --> 13:59.430
Wait. Hey, guys?

13:59.490 --> 14:02.400
There he is, my
buddy, Hugo! Hi.

14:02.460 --> 14:04.060
Oh, hi, Bob.
Hi, Bobby.

14:04.130 --> 14:05.600
What are you both
doing right now?

14:05.670 --> 14:07.200
My, uh, place, uh,

14:07.270 --> 14:08.940
happened to get
destroyed last night.

14:09.000 --> 14:10.340
Oh, really?
Yeah.

14:10.400 --> 14:12.070
In the middle of...
Bob, I'm very busy.

14:12.140 --> 14:14.210
I have tables and tables
of bisque to judge.

14:14.280 --> 14:16.280
Hey, I hooked you
two up last night,

14:16.340 --> 14:19.010
and you guys kind of broke the baby-changing
station in the bathroom.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.650
Slap him with a citation, Hugo.

14:21.720 --> 14:23.920
I want to watch.
Baby likes civil authority?

14:23.990 --> 14:26.720
Yes, I love civil authority.
I'll show baby civil authority.

14:26.790 --> 14:28.620
Stilts guy!
You fell through my window.

14:28.690 --> 14:30.660
Lot of glass on the floor.

14:30.730 --> 14:32.660
Where you going?
Got to go, Bob!

14:32.730 --> 14:35.030
If I stay still too
long, I fall over!

14:35.100 --> 14:37.710
P-people! Wait! Stop!

14:37.780 --> 14:39.080
Wait! People!

14:39.150 --> 14:41.450
Do you think
you can just ignore me?!

14:43.040 --> 14:45.240
Well, as far as
accidental death goes,

14:45.310 --> 14:47.110
this one was pretty tasty.

14:47.180 --> 14:49.210
I feel tingly.
Do you feel tingly?

14:49.280 --> 14:50.810
I think he's having
an allergic reaction.

14:50.880 --> 14:52.450
We should do something.

14:52.510 --> 14:54.820
Yeah, let's sit on him
and see if he pops.

14:56.370 --> 14:57.870
No, we should take him
to Lobsterfest.

14:57.940 --> 14:59.200
They have a medical tent.

14:59.270 --> 15:00.740
And I could get more Lobster!

15:00.810 --> 15:02.770
Oh, pop!
I'm trying!

15:04.580 --> 15:05.590
Let's hear it
for John van horton

15:05.680 --> 15:08.430
and the music extrusion!

15:08.500 --> 15:11.160
Uh, it's me. Bob!

15:12.200 --> 15:14.870
Bob. Bob. Bob.

15:14.940 --> 15:16.670
Okay...

15:16.740 --> 15:17.770
Settle down.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.510
Listen, what's going on here?

15:19.570 --> 15:21.010
What are we doing?

15:21.080 --> 15:23.580
Last thing I remember,
you were all in my place

15:23.640 --> 15:25.050
and it was bobsterfest.

15:25.110 --> 15:26.880
I want to get back to that.

15:26.950 --> 15:28.620
Let's go back to <i>that!</i>

15:28.680 --> 15:31.420
Or at the very least,
40 or 50 of you

15:31.490 --> 15:34.960
come with me right now and help
me clean up the restaurant!

15:35.020 --> 15:36.920
Not all at once.

15:36.990 --> 15:38.390
Clean it yourself!

15:38.460 --> 15:40.930
Whoa, dad's on the stage
at Lobsterfest.

15:41.010 --> 15:43.630
My eyes don't work.
Paint me a word picture.

15:43.700 --> 15:45.200
Kids? What are
you doing here?

15:45.270 --> 15:46.170
Nothing.

15:46.230 --> 15:47.200
What's wrong with gene?

15:47.270 --> 15:48.400
He looks horrible.

15:48.470 --> 15:49.800
He looks like he always looks.

15:49.870 --> 15:51.470
No, he doesn't. Does he?

15:51.540 --> 15:52.870
Looks like an allergic...

15:52.940 --> 15:55.110
Did you eat Lobster?!

15:55.180 --> 15:57.240
I, uh...
He refuses to answer that.

15:57.310 --> 15:59.780
What's wrong with you people!

15:59.850 --> 16:01.700
Look at my son!
Hello.

16:01.770 --> 16:02.980
<i>You</i> did this!

16:03.050 --> 16:05.950
You and your
disgusting food fetish!

16:06.020 --> 16:07.420
Bob, get off the stage!

16:07.490 --> 16:08.690
You're disorderly.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.820
Oh, yeah? Maybe
I should get disorderly

16:10.890 --> 16:12.660
with this Lobster pot here.

16:12.730 --> 16:15.230
That's right, you heard me--
you trash my restaurant,

16:15.300 --> 16:17.900
I trash Lobsterfest,
starting with this Lobster pot.

16:17.970 --> 16:19.050
Ow! It's hot.

16:19.120 --> 16:20.450
Let's leave that alone.

16:20.520 --> 16:22.120
Oh, but I-I see some butter.

16:22.190 --> 16:23.550
You wouldn't like it if someone

16:23.620 --> 16:25.090
messed with
your precious butter!

16:25.160 --> 16:27.690
Like stuff a big,
hairy toe in it!

16:27.760 --> 16:29.130
Bob, put your foot

16:29.190 --> 16:30.930
back in your sock slowly.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.430
I'm authorizing myself to use

16:32.500 --> 16:35.800
my brand-new beanbag
gun to subdue you.

16:35.850 --> 16:38.230
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
excuse me, excuse me.

16:38.300 --> 16:40.750
Bob! No!
This isn't you!

16:40.820 --> 16:42.090
This <i>is</i> me, Linda!

16:42.160 --> 16:43.920
This is the me that they made!

16:43.990 --> 16:46.390
And look what
they did to our son.

16:46.460 --> 16:47.660
That's not how

16:47.730 --> 16:49.000
he normally looks, is it?

16:49.060 --> 16:50.330
Bobby, listen to me.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.780
Excuse me, I'm sorry, oh...

16:51.850 --> 16:53.230
You don't have to keep moving!

16:53.300 --> 16:56.900
You're not a bottom-feeder, Bob!

16:56.970 --> 16:59.870
No, I'm not a bottom-feeder.

16:59.940 --> 17:02.110
I'm a burger man.

17:02.180 --> 17:05.210
All right, I'm leaving.

17:05.280 --> 17:07.950
I'm sure that's
what everybody wants.

17:08.020 --> 17:09.329
Oh, what happens
if I-- oh, woops!

17:09.400 --> 17:10.430
Ow!

17:14.520 --> 17:15.660
Bobby, are you okay?

17:15.720 --> 17:16.970
Excuse me, uh,

17:17.040 --> 17:18.630
excuse me.

17:18.690 --> 17:20.260
Oh, my God!

17:20.329 --> 17:21.859
All the butter's been
contaminated by Bob,

17:21.930 --> 17:23.859
and there isn't
any more in town!

17:27.650 --> 17:29.310
Bob destroyed Lobsterfest!

17:29.400 --> 17:31.720
Can't you just eat Lobster
without butter?

17:31.780 --> 17:33.650
No! How?
That's an outrage!

17:33.720 --> 17:35.670
Well, why don't you
call it butterfest?

17:35.740 --> 17:36.990
It brings out
the succulence, jerk!

17:37.060 --> 17:38.020
Yeah!

17:38.090 --> 17:39.440
So what should we do with him?

17:39.490 --> 17:41.060
Throw him in the shell pile!

17:41.130 --> 17:42.030
Shell pile?

17:42.090 --> 17:44.200
Shell pile! Shell pile!

17:44.260 --> 17:46.660
Shell pile! Shell pile! Shell...

17:46.730 --> 17:47.730
Oh, boy.

17:47.800 --> 17:49.670
Excuse me, excuse me, sorry.

17:49.730 --> 17:52.070
Maybe Bob shouldn't have
threatened your butter,

17:52.140 --> 17:54.710
and he definitely should have
charged you for the burgers.

17:54.770 --> 17:56.370
Boo...!

17:56.440 --> 17:58.880
But he opened his
beautiful heart last night,

17:58.940 --> 18:01.680
and you boiled it alive
like a Lobster!

18:01.750 --> 18:03.760
All you're doing
is making us angrier!

18:03.830 --> 18:04.830
Shell pile!

18:04.900 --> 18:06.070
Shell pile!

18:06.130 --> 18:08.000
Sorry, Bobby, I used
a bad analogy.

18:08.070 --> 18:09.240
Hugo, this doesn't seem right.

18:09.300 --> 18:10.870
What?
I have a girlfriend;

18:10.940 --> 18:13.170
Bob's about to be
thrown on to a shell pile--

18:13.240 --> 18:14.980
I've had this exact fantasy.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.440
Come on, Hugo.

18:16.510 --> 18:18.700
If Bob hadn't been
your wingman last night,

18:18.760 --> 18:21.200
you'd be another lonely
guy in a satin sash.

18:21.280 --> 18:22.500
I was doing fine!

18:22.570 --> 18:25.150
I don't need a wingman!

18:25.220 --> 18:26.750
Oh, no?

18:28.860 --> 18:30.390
♪ Wingman ♪

18:30.460 --> 18:32.190
♪ flying with the eagles ♪

18:32.260 --> 18:33.580
♪ wingman ♪

18:33.650 --> 18:35.580

18:35.650 --> 18:37.200

18:37.270 --> 18:40.170

18:40.240 --> 18:44.040

18:44.110 --> 18:45.890
Agh! Damn it, Ron!

18:45.970 --> 18:47.560
All right, attention, people!

18:47.640 --> 18:49.630
Stop it, everyone!
Slow down!

18:49.690 --> 18:51.730
I'm the health inspector.

18:51.800 --> 18:55.500
Someone once told me that's
like being the food sheriff.

18:55.570 --> 18:57.840
This vat of butter
isn't contaminated by Bob

18:57.900 --> 18:59.800
until I say so!

18:59.870 --> 19:03.040
I have with me
a dairy purity spectrometer.

19:03.110 --> 19:04.040
Oh...

19:04.110 --> 19:05.390
Now, give me some room.

19:05.460 --> 19:06.710
Give him some room!

19:06.780 --> 19:08.630
Thank you, Gretchen.

19:09.800 --> 19:11.220
Ow! You stabbed me!

19:11.300 --> 19:12.500
That's just epinephrine.

19:12.550 --> 19:13.630
You're in anaphylactic shock.

19:13.700 --> 19:15.250
Mm, you're a handsome shrimp.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.450
You just jumped
to the top of my list.

19:17.520 --> 19:19.660
It's a mating list
for when the world ends.

19:19.720 --> 19:21.280
Can I get your e-mail?
No.

19:21.340 --> 19:23.480
I have finished
my butter analysis.

19:26.110 --> 19:28.350
Bob's skin flakes,
arm hair and fingernail dirt

19:28.420 --> 19:29.650
are all present.

19:29.720 --> 19:31.090
No! That's disgusting!

19:31.150 --> 19:32.790
Let me finish!

19:32.850 --> 19:35.360
They're present,
but not at threatening levels.

19:35.420 --> 19:37.590
The butter is
grade c to d-minus.

19:37.660 --> 19:39.410
Fit for everyone except babies

19:39.480 --> 19:41.580
and people with
compromised immune systems.

19:41.650 --> 19:44.110
In other words, get your bib on!

19:48.050 --> 19:50.670
Man, that was the best
Lobsterfest ever.

19:50.740 --> 19:53.070
Yeah. Turns out people
are hard on the outside

19:53.140 --> 19:54.910
and soft on the inside.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.340
Like, uh...

19:56.410 --> 19:58.550
Like, uh...

19:58.610 --> 20:00.380
Uh...

20:00.450 --> 20:03.000
Oh, I don't know,
like a... like a crab.

20:03.070 --> 20:04.740
Yup. People are
just like crabs.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.350
And we witnessed the birth
of a new tradition--

20:07.420 --> 20:10.020
every year on Lobsterfest Eve,
we trash Bob's place.

20:10.090 --> 20:11.240
No, no, no, no.
Right?

20:11.310 --> 20:12.810
Let's start now!

20:12.880 --> 20:15.280
Gene, you swear
you didn't have Lobster?

20:15.350 --> 20:16.810
You've always looked like this?

20:16.880 --> 20:18.520
I was born like this.

20:18.580 --> 20:21.220
Uh, I need a picture
to compare.

20:21.290 --> 20:22.550
Oh, my God,

20:22.620 --> 20:24.020
you <i>do</i> always look like this.

20:24.090 --> 20:25.120
Hello, gorgeous!

20:26.320 --> 20:28.780
Bob, Linda.
Hey, Hugo.

20:28.830 --> 20:30.160
Where's Gretchen?

20:30.250 --> 20:32.210
She's a firecracker,
that Gretchen.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.680
You sure she's not more than you
can handle, Hugo?

20:34.750 --> 20:36.120
Gretchen just broke up with me.

20:36.180 --> 20:38.350
She said she was more
than I could handle.

20:38.420 --> 20:39.890
Oh.
It was ugly.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.960
She said she didn't
mind a small badge,

20:42.020 --> 20:45.060
but said I didn't know
how to use it, Bob!

20:45.130 --> 20:46.160
Ow.
Ouch.

20:46.230 --> 20:47.460
Oh, that's too bad.

20:47.530 --> 20:49.760
I don't need your pity!

20:49.830 --> 20:52.330
So, here we are.

20:52.400 --> 20:54.470
- Surprise inspection!
- Oh.

20:54.540 --> 20:55.470
Pencil!
Pencil.

20:55.540 --> 20:56.640
Pad!
Pad.

20:56.710 --> 21:00.539
Ooh, bent spindle.
Ron! Shut it down!
