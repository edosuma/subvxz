19:22.291 --> 19:23.945
So what are they charging him
with, capital murder

19:23.988 --> 19:25.294
or are they favoring
hate crime charges?

19:25.338 --> 19:27.601
- No charges yet.

19:27.644 --> 19:30.212
Uh, agents have questions
about Ivan's confession.

19:30.256 --> 19:31.735
- Questions?

19:31.779 --> 19:33.259
- Yeah, they wanna gather
more evidence,

19:33.302 --> 19:35.174
corroborate his story.

19:35.217 --> 19:36.305
- I get it.

19:36.349 --> 19:37.741
The Bureau wants to soft pedal
this guy

19:37.785 --> 19:39.134
because they don't want to
embarrass themselves

19:39.178 --> 19:40.744
for screwing up.

19:40.788 --> 19:42.224
- Okay, we're not trying
to cover up anything.

19:42.268 --> 19:44.139
- Not you, personally.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.054
- But my team is?

19:47.011 --> 19:48.926
- If a black guy confessed
to shooting people

19:48.970 --> 19:50.276
at an Alt-Right rally,

19:50.319 --> 19:51.886
would agents be out
looking through trash cans

19:51.929 --> 19:53.627
to prove he's innocent?

19:53.670 --> 19:54.976
Hell no.

19:55.019 --> 19:57.544
The suspect would
be halfway to death row.

20:03.332 --> 20:04.725
This is the kind of story that

20:04.768 --> 20:06.422
the people in the community
need to know about.

20:06.466 --> 20:08.381
If you want to talk
to a reporter,

20:08.424 --> 20:10.383
I know someone at "The Ledger"
that you can speak with.

20:10.426 --> 20:13.037
- A reporter?
And what would I tell them?

20:13.081 --> 20:14.778
- Tell them that the feds are
sitting on a confession

20:14.822 --> 20:15.823
because they don't want
to embarrass themselves

20:15.866 --> 20:17.172
for sitting
on actionable threats

20:17.216 --> 20:18.608
against
an African-American nightclub.

20:21.263 --> 20:24.745
I'd do it myself, but the story
will be so much bigger

20:24.788 --> 20:25.833
and get so much more attention

20:25.876 --> 20:28.183
if it came
from the inside the FBI.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.619
- I can't sell out my people.

20:29.663 --> 20:31.752
- Who, agents?

20:31.795 --> 20:34.102
Those are your people?

20:36.322 --> 20:38.628
Things won't change
unless people in power,

20:38.672 --> 20:40.717
people like you and me,
make it happen.

20:44.417 --> 20:46.810
Just think about it.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.905
- I never saw Ivan wearing
a hoodie of any kind.

20:54.949 --> 20:56.603
- Does he wear a bracelet?

20:56.646 --> 20:58.605
- No, not that I'm aware of.

20:58.648 --> 21:01.738
- Okay, did you spend time with
him the night of the shooting?

21:01.782 --> 21:03.262
- I was working.

21:03.305 --> 21:04.741
- What would you say
his mood was like?

21:04.785 --> 21:07.788
That morning
or leading up to that.

21:07.831 --> 21:12.488
- He seemed a little distant,
angry.

21:12.532 --> 21:14.577
I wish I could give you
something else but--

21:16.710 --> 21:18.929
No, it's my fault, all of this.

21:18.973 --> 21:20.757
I didn't do a good job of
shielding him

21:20.801 --> 21:22.324
from all of my problems.

21:22.368 --> 21:25.980
All the arguing--

21:26.023 --> 21:29.244
I tried, but my ex-husband,
he's--

21:30.419 --> 21:33.553
Well, he's not a nice person.
Let's just leave it at that.

21:33.596 --> 21:35.903
We were constantly arguing

21:35.946 --> 21:40.342
and Ivan became
so full of rage about it all.

21:40.386 --> 21:41.517
- So when did he
become involved

21:41.561 --> 21:42.866
with white nationalists?

21:42.910 --> 21:44.912
- A few months ago.

21:44.955 --> 21:47.044
I begged him to stay away
from it, but--

21:47.088 --> 21:48.655
- Well, how did Ivan's father
feel about that?

21:48.698 --> 21:50.352
- He was horrified.

21:50.396 --> 21:54.443
I mean, he's a son of a bitch
and all but he's not a racist.

21:54.487 --> 21:56.532
I tried to get Ivan help.

21:56.576 --> 21:59.753
We went to therapist
after therapist, but--

22:03.104 --> 22:05.802
Sorry.

22:07.630 --> 22:09.806
- Thank you for your time.

22:16.857 --> 22:18.772
Is this Ivan?

22:20.556 --> 22:22.253
- Father-son hunting trip.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.299
Ivan's dad insisted
on taking him.

22:24.343 --> 22:25.387
- How old is he there?

22:25.431 --> 22:27.128
- Hmm, about ten.

22:27.171 --> 22:31.959
Ivan loved the crisp mornings,
the fresh air, the quiet.

22:32.002 --> 22:34.353
Blood and dead animals
scared him to death.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.921
The ex and I felt
like hell about it.

22:37.965 --> 22:41.403
- Has he ever shown aggression
towards animals or pets?

22:41.447 --> 22:44.580
- My son makes a home for every
stray cat in the neighborhood.

22:44.624 --> 22:47.670
- Did he ever try
hunting again?

22:47.714 --> 22:48.976
- That's why the thought

22:49.019 --> 22:50.586
of Ivan shooting people
is so disturbing.

22:50.630 --> 22:53.372
It makes no sense.

22:58.942 --> 23:00.857
- Hey, we didn't find
any evidence

23:00.901 --> 23:03.251
to support or refute
Ivan's story.

23:03.294 --> 23:04.470
But we're gonna keep looking.

23:04.513 --> 23:06.472
- I'm with Maggie now, guys.

23:06.515 --> 23:08.561
After talking to his mom and
learning how spooked he gets

23:08.604 --> 23:10.214
at the idea of hunting,

23:10.258 --> 23:11.999
I just don't see this kid
becoming a killer.

23:12.042 --> 23:14.828
- Ivan knew details that had
never been reported.

23:14.871 --> 23:17.047
He knew the type of gun,
the number of shots.

23:17.091 --> 23:19.572
- Yeah, but he was also milling
around the crime scene.

23:19.615 --> 23:21.704
I mean, everything he told us,
he really could have overheard

23:21.748 --> 23:23.402
from witnesses.

23:26.100 --> 23:28.537
- Maybe we should show them
what we found.

23:28.581 --> 23:30.583
- Yes, um.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.933
So while you two were out
with the mother,

23:32.976 --> 23:35.588
Scola and I did
some digging of our own.

23:35.631 --> 23:38.634
A counterfeiting ring turned
over a list of fake IDs

23:38.678 --> 23:41.202
used to purchase guns from
sellers in Brooklyn.

23:41.245 --> 23:43.334
- The ring was busted
last month.

23:43.378 --> 23:44.945
- Dustin Burroughs
from Bronxville

23:44.988 --> 23:46.163
is one of the names
on the list,

23:46.207 --> 23:48.862
and agents found this
in Ivan's bedroom.

23:50.298 --> 23:51.734
- Dustin Burroughs.

23:51.778 --> 23:53.997
So Ivan had a fake ID.

23:54.041 --> 23:55.521
- Okay, so this
Dustin Burroughs guy

23:55.564 --> 23:56.783
actually buy a gun?

23:56.826 --> 23:58.828
- No, not that we know of.

24:01.048 --> 24:04.617
- So you wanna charge Ivan
with murder based on a fake ID?

24:04.660 --> 24:06.401
- No, I wanna charge him

24:06.445 --> 24:08.882
based on the fact
that he actually confessed.

24:08.925 --> 24:11.406
- Plenty of suspects have been
convicted on that alone.

24:14.322 --> 24:16.193
- Yeah, look, I know
this doesn't make much sense,

24:16.237 --> 24:19.414
but I'm telling you his tone
and mannerisms were off.

24:19.458 --> 24:20.981
- Not all killers emote.

24:23.157 --> 24:25.899
- Regardless, guys,
we need more.

24:28.075 --> 24:30.599
- Well, we can hold Ivan
for 48 hours,

24:30.643 --> 24:32.819
so let's get it right.
Do what you gotta do.

24:38.259 --> 24:40.043
- Okay, Maggie, what's next?

24:40.087 --> 24:41.088
We already searched
the dumpsters

24:41.131 --> 24:42.393
and we talked
to Ivan's mom.

24:42.437 --> 24:44.178
- Ian, the pink wristbands,
got anything?

24:44.221 --> 24:46.093
- Three different venues
issued them on Saturday.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.355
I can show you the algorithm
I used.

24:47.398 --> 24:49.270
- We don't have time for that.
Thanks.

24:49.313 --> 24:51.272
- Right, here's the list.

24:51.315 --> 24:52.795
Fundraiser for pregnant teens,

24:52.839 --> 24:54.101
the NICU at a hospital
in Queens,

24:54.144 --> 24:56.669
and a Brooklyn nightclub
called Club Nero.

24:56.712 --> 24:57.539
- Club Nero was handing out
pink wristbands

24:57.583 --> 24:59.019
on Saturday night?

24:59.062 --> 25:00.411
- Yep, with a wristband you got
access

25:00.455 --> 25:01.412
to every floor
in the club.

25:01.456 --> 25:02.544
- Okay, I'm all for confirming

25:02.588 --> 25:04.024
that Ivan was
wearing a wristband,

25:04.067 --> 25:05.721
but that club had to have
handed out hundreds of them.

25:05.765 --> 25:07.114
- I know, it's not much.

25:07.157 --> 25:08.289
But if it's a clue,
we gotta track this down.

25:08.332 --> 25:09.769
- [sighs]
Okay.

25:09.812 --> 25:11.379
- A white dude showed up
wearing sneakers and a hoodie

25:11.422 --> 25:12.467
the other night.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.642
But that ain't him.

25:13.686 --> 25:14.774
- Well, what'd he look like?

25:14.817 --> 25:16.906
- He was older.
Good looking dude.

25:16.950 --> 25:19.039
Not as fresh faced as that kid.

25:19.082 --> 25:21.345
His clothes weren't kosher,
like at all.

25:22.303 --> 25:23.565
I let him in because
it was early.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.262
I figured he'd run up a tab
at the bar.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.568
- And did he?

25:26.612 --> 25:28.178
- Yeah, sat here for hours.

25:30.180 --> 25:32.095
- Are these
security cameras on?

25:32.139 --> 25:33.575
- Should be.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.403
- We need the video from
Saturday night.

25:39.146 --> 25:40.495
- Still no charges?

25:44.020 --> 25:45.282
How long they gonna
drag this out?

25:49.504 --> 25:51.898
[whispering] It's time
to call that reporter.

25:51.941 --> 25:54.117
You know it's the right move.

26:05.520 --> 26:08.262
- Our friend unhappy
about the delay in charges?

26:08.305 --> 26:10.917
- Just wants to do right
by the people in Bushwick.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.919
You know, the victims.

26:12.962 --> 26:15.008
- So do the rest of us.

26:17.227 --> 26:19.534
Oh, he's got inside your head,
huh?

26:22.058 --> 26:24.495
Just do
what you think is right.

26:24.539 --> 26:26.062
Not what Damon thinks.

26:30.719 --> 26:33.896
You were promoted to special
agent because you're smart,

26:33.940 --> 26:36.507
'cause you've demonstrated that
you can make the right decision

26:36.551 --> 26:38.031
when the pressure is on.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.904
Just remember that.
Okay?

26:45.473 --> 26:48.432
[dramatic music]

26:48.476 --> 26:55.265
♪

27:07.234 --> 27:09.236
- Exact same clothes
as the shooter.

27:09.279 --> 27:10.498
- Yup.

27:11.064 --> 27:12.239
- Hey, Maggie just sent over

27:12.282 --> 27:13.675
a still of the suspect
from Club Nero.

27:13.719 --> 27:14.894
- Oh.

27:14.937 --> 27:16.156
- Pull it up.
- Yeah.

27:17.984 --> 27:19.681
- What's going on?

27:19.725 --> 27:22.728
- Maggie and OA got a photo
of the shooter.

27:22.771 --> 27:23.816
Yeah.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.954
- Maggie was right.

27:33.564 --> 27:35.131
- Ivan's not our killer.

27:45.968 --> 27:48.754
- First priority, we identify
our mystery man in that photo.

27:48.797 --> 27:50.233
- I'm running it through
facial recognition.

27:50.277 --> 27:51.104
- I'll help.

27:53.541 --> 27:55.369
It'll go faster
with two people.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.111
- Let us know if you find
a match.

27:58.154 --> 28:00.504
- Maggie just sent over
the surveillance video.

28:00.548 --> 28:01.592
Pulling it up right now.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.862
- Let's find him, too,
the bartender.

28:09.905 --> 28:11.124
Maybe he knows something.

28:11.167 --> 28:13.300
- Maggie and OA are talking
to him right now.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.650
- I remember that guy.

28:15.694 --> 28:16.390
I didn't get a name
or anything,

28:16.433 --> 28:17.608
but I do remember him.

28:17.652 --> 28:21.134
He kinda had an intense vibe.

28:21.177 --> 28:24.790
Is he like a mafioso or
in the import-export biz maybe?

28:24.833 --> 28:26.226
Those guys always seem shady.

28:26.269 --> 28:28.532
- Look, why don't we ask
you the questions?

28:28.576 --> 28:30.447
- Right, my bad.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.840
- Did he say why he came in?

28:31.884 --> 28:33.624
- I figured it was for
the Oliver Samuel Reserve.

28:33.668 --> 28:34.625
- What, the whiskey?

28:34.669 --> 28:36.018
- You know it?
- Yeah.

28:36.062 --> 28:37.628
- I don't drink.

28:37.672 --> 28:38.934
- Twelve-stepper?

28:40.936 --> 28:43.330
Ah, I did it again, didn't I?
- Yeah.

28:44.331 --> 28:46.942
- Uh, we don't keep the real
expensive stuff on the shelf.

28:46.986 --> 28:49.336
Only people in the know
order the stuff.

28:49.379 --> 28:51.860
- Would you say he was familiar
with this place, then?

28:51.904 --> 28:53.775
- No, he knew we carried it

28:53.819 --> 28:55.516
because he used to drive
the trucks that deliver it

28:55.559 --> 28:57.910
to bars and liquor stores
around Brooklyn.

29:00.347 --> 29:02.044
- Okay.

29:02.088 --> 29:03.829
- Yeah, I recognize him.

29:03.872 --> 29:04.830
Name's Jim.

29:04.873 --> 29:06.832
Jim Housley Dietz.

29:06.875 --> 29:08.181
- Does he work here?

29:08.224 --> 29:11.314
- Used to, but I fired him
the other day.

29:11.358 --> 29:12.794
Personally, I like the kid.

29:12.838 --> 29:15.623
Hard worker, smart,
charismatic.

29:15.666 --> 29:17.364
- Well, then,
why'd you let him go?

29:17.407 --> 29:20.236
- The other day, he went off on
an Afro-American store owner.

29:21.498 --> 29:23.457
- I think you mean
African-American.

29:24.675 --> 29:25.720
- Yeah.

29:27.635 --> 29:29.637
- Did he physically
threaten him?

29:29.680 --> 29:31.291
- No, just called him
all kinda names.

29:31.334 --> 29:32.727
Racist stuff.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.685
- Did Jim have a problem with
African-Americans?

29:34.729 --> 29:36.209
- Not that I ever knew.

29:36.252 --> 29:38.515
But there was no way I could
keep him on after that.

29:38.559 --> 29:40.082
- How'd he take that?

29:40.126 --> 29:41.823
- Like any man would.
Not well.

29:41.867 --> 29:43.433
He started making excuses.

29:43.477 --> 29:45.827
Said something about
breaking up with his girl.

29:47.481 --> 29:48.874
