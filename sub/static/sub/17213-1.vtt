00:36.537 --> 00:40.999
"You're... a... b-b...

00:43.043 --> 00:44.544
big...

00:44.628 --> 00:47.798
g... girl... now."

00:47.923 --> 00:49.549
Marcy?

00:49.675 --> 00:52.427
I gotta leave early tonight.
You all right alone?

00:53.303 --> 00:54.930
I'm... I'm fine.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.183
Don't forget to take your break.
You work too hard.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.852
I won't. I won't.

01:00.936 --> 01:03.063
Bye, Tory.

01:30.882 --> 01:31.925
Don't!

01:34.469 --> 01:35.554
Stop!

02:49.002 --> 02:52.047
David gave that to me!
David gave that to me!

02:53.548 --> 02:54.925
David--

03:04.059 --> 03:06.186
Ah!

03:07.312 --> 03:09.815
Ah!

03:10.899 --> 03:12.442
Ah!

03:16.822 --> 03:18.198
Aah!

03:37.968 --> 03:39.219
That's mine.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.347
Holy shit.

04:45.076 --> 04:46.119
Trevor.

04:46.203 --> 04:48.288
You stay down, man.
He's better than you.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.334
-You can stay down, man!
-Shut up!

04:54.294 --> 04:56.046
You should've stayed down.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.314
Trevor! Trevor!

05:23.448 --> 05:24.574
Aah!

05:49.975 --> 05:52.018
I concede the fight.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.363
-Do we need to cut it?
-Nah.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.399
Ahh!

07:26.071 --> 07:27.030
It's okay.

07:27.113 --> 07:28.448
It's okay.
It's almost ready.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.378
Carly?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.129
Carly?

07:43.254 --> 07:45.131
You're not
coming in like that.

07:45.256 --> 07:47.133
You promised, Jeff.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.135
Come on, Carly.
Don't make me mad.

07:49.260 --> 07:51.096
I gotta take a piss.

08:07.404 --> 08:09.197
Not supposed to be here
when you drink.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.282
- Why is he crying?
- He's just hungry.

08:11.408 --> 08:12.534
Give him something to eat!

08:12.617 --> 08:14.661
I'm warming it up.

08:16.538 --> 08:17.789
What is this shit?

08:18.915 --> 08:21.668
It's baby food.
He's a baby, Jeff.

08:27.424 --> 08:29.551
Don't talk to me
like I'm an idiot.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.947
This is bullshit.
Yo, come on!

08:51.031 --> 08:53.158
Hey, all you're doing
is pissing me off!

09:12.677 --> 09:15.180
Listen, I'm sorry.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.431
You make me crazy.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.641
You need to go.

09:22.437 --> 09:23.688
All right.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.191
I'm going.

10:09.192 --> 10:10.360
"Ruok"?

10:13.571 --> 10:14.614
"Ru-ok"?

10:16.950 --> 10:18.243
"Ruok..."

10:18.326 --> 10:19.536
You're up early.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.001
The headache wake you?

10:27.127 --> 10:28.586
The sound of birds.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.883
Know how stupid it is
to pick a fight before a game?

10:34.008 --> 10:36.386
How do you throw a football
with a broken hand?

10:36.469 --> 10:39.764
Doctors are more
concerned with his concussion.

10:39.848 --> 10:41.766
You blow your chance
at a scholarship,

10:41.850 --> 10:43.518
you better start
learning to flip burgers.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.771
All right.
You scoot upstairs. Get ready.

10:46.896 --> 10:49.566
They wanted to see you again
in the morning.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.525
Thank you, Mom.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.159
"Thank you, Mom"?

10:59.242 --> 11:00.785
Who the hell's that?

11:47.081 --> 11:48.207
Philip Pearson?

11:49.417 --> 11:51.711
Tried to find you
at the university.

11:51.836 --> 11:52.837
I'm Detective Gower.

11:52.921 --> 11:54.589
"Gower"?

11:54.714 --> 11:56.424
Your roommate
passed away last night.

11:59.469 --> 12:02.472
You don't seem surprised.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.484
It's me.

12:23.117 --> 12:24.744
- David?
- Yeah.

12:27.372 --> 12:30.625
Oh! That's...
not appropriate.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.210
Marcy, put some clothes on.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.130
Yeah, I can't, uh...

12:36.214 --> 12:39.759
be your boyfriend, Marcy,
w-we talked about this.

12:43.972 --> 12:45.139
What's that?

12:46.891 --> 12:48.309
Oh...

12:48.393 --> 12:50.269
What happened?

12:50.395 --> 12:52.397
Uh... I fell.

12:52.522 --> 12:55.149
And you just went home?

12:55.274 --> 12:57.193
Oh, kiddo, are you okay?
Does it hurt?

12:57.276 --> 12:59.404
I'm fine.

12:59.487 --> 13:01.406
Well, I know
going to the doctor's

13:01.489 --> 13:03.866
not your favorite thing
in the world, but...

13:06.160 --> 13:09.288
That's a--
That's a nasty cut.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.667
Is this appropriate?

13:12.792 --> 13:16.170
Appropriate? Sure.

13:16.295 --> 13:18.548
Maybe some underwear.

13:22.301 --> 13:23.720
So you skipped out?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.805
I just walked.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.181
Uh-huh.

13:27.265 --> 13:29.934
And the loaded syringe
we found on the table,

13:30.059 --> 13:32.270
that wasn't meant for you?

13:33.688 --> 13:35.732
Uh, what difference
does it make?

13:35.815 --> 13:40.319
Did Stephen inject himself,
or did you do it for him?

13:40.445 --> 13:43.239
Because your prints
were found on both syringes.

13:43.322 --> 13:45.950
I was there, but then I-I left.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.827
Yeah...

13:47.910 --> 13:50.329
because you knew
he was gonna O.D.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.126
Yeah, you knew.

13:55.209 --> 14:00.214
You know, a phone call to 911
could've saved his life.

14:00.298 --> 14:02.800
That's cold, Philip.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.596
Either way,
you have got a problem.

14:08.473 --> 14:10.391
On top of your drug problem.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.393
I don't have a drug problem.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.145
I know who your dealer is.

14:14.228 --> 14:15.730
I know how much you buy.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.357
I know who your friends are
and where you're from.

14:18.441 --> 14:20.985
You have no idea where I'm from.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.904
You inject somebody,
they O.D.,

14:22.987 --> 14:24.530
that's manslaughter.

14:24.614 --> 14:25.615
I have the right

14:25.740 --> 14:27.283
to court-appointed
legal counsel, yes?

14:27.367 --> 14:30.328
Sure you don't want
to call your parents instead?

14:34.749 --> 14:38.336
You think you're sick now,
wait till your lawyer shows up.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.589
I'm proud of you, you know.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.427
What? What for?

14:46.511 --> 14:48.388
You got knocked
in the head last night,

14:48.513 --> 14:49.764
and you're...

14:49.889 --> 14:52.266
you know, the naked thing,
that-- that was weird,

14:52.392 --> 14:55.603
but otherwise, you're handling
this amazingly well.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.527
Hey, it's Thursday.

15:03.903 --> 15:05.196
It's reading-aloud day.

15:05.279 --> 15:08.616
There's no point in wasting
time sitting on a bus.

15:09.742 --> 15:12.578
It's just me.
It can be anything at all.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.664
Think I got your favorite.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.457
"Police were forced
to use tear gas

15:16.541 --> 15:17.667
to disperse a crowd

15:17.750 --> 15:19.293
shortly after
a not-guilty verdict

15:19.377 --> 15:21.796
was announced out--"

15:27.427 --> 15:28.803
What?

15:28.886 --> 15:31.055
What-- What's wrong?

15:45.778 --> 15:48.030
You didn't answer your cell.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.701
What did they say?

15:51.784 --> 15:53.828
I have a concussion.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.079
Oh, no.

15:55.163 --> 15:57.957
Will you be able to play
in the game next week?

15:58.040 --> 15:59.709
The doctor said that...

15:59.792 --> 16:01.586
if I hadn't walked away
from the fight,

16:01.711 --> 16:02.712
I might have died.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.756
Does it hurt now?

16:05.840 --> 16:07.216
A little.

16:09.594 --> 16:10.845
Are your folks home?

16:10.970 --> 16:13.556
No. Why?

16:16.058 --> 16:18.478
Oh, I don't think
that we should, Rene,

16:18.561 --> 16:19.729
'cause my concussion.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.606
Let me make you feel better.

16:24.233 --> 16:26.903
Look. Please, stop.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.989
-I don't think that we should.
-Are you breaking up with me?

16:30.114 --> 16:31.324
No!

16:32.742 --> 16:36.871
If anything...
I want to be closer to you.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.623
There are things
I don't remember.

16:38.748 --> 16:39.665
Things about me?

16:39.749 --> 16:41.876
It's more things about myself.

16:41.959 --> 16:44.253
The doctor said
that a concussion as bad as this

16:44.378 --> 16:47.381
can cause changes in personality
and memory loss,

16:47.507 --> 16:48.883
that the only treatment
is time--

16:48.966 --> 16:52.678
that in time I'll be the person
I was before the concussion.

16:52.762 --> 16:55.515
I need you to help me
remember who that person is.

16:56.516 --> 17:00.394
Y-You want me to help you
find yourself?

17:00.520 --> 17:02.438
Trev...

17:02.522 --> 17:03.856
That is so beautiful.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.945
Look...

17:09.028 --> 17:10.947
You should go.

17:11.072 --> 17:13.449
I don't want to,
but I will.

17:13.533 --> 17:15.660
That's how much I love you.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.935
Daddy's coming.

17:51.320 --> 17:52.238
You busy right now?

17:53.239 --> 17:54.115
Not yet.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.866
We just got sent a red flag.

17:57.368 --> 17:59.495
Can't you handle it?
I'm all over Jonas Walker.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.163
I'm in court
today and tomorrow.

18:01.247 --> 18:02.665
What's the flag?

18:02.748 --> 18:04.250
Potential cell.

18:04.375 --> 18:08.379
Encrypted communication
in the deep web.

18:08.504 --> 18:10.506
I have no idea
what I'm looking at.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.551
Analyst who flagged it is hoping
that they're just gamers.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.011
Who travel, apparently.

18:15.094 --> 18:17.138
Those GPS coordinates
correspond

18:17.221 --> 18:18.639
to an abandoned building
downtown.

18:18.723 --> 18:19.807
And what's a "T.E.L.L."?

18:19.890 --> 18:21.267
I asked the same question.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.102
They ran it
and nothing showed up.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.272
Aw, shit, I'm late.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.025
It's probably nothing, but...

18:29.150 --> 18:31.319
Yeah, yeah. I got it.
I'll let you know.

18:31.402 --> 18:32.445
Have fun in court.

18:33.404 --> 18:34.572
Make sure Jonas Walker

18:34.655 --> 18:37.658
doesn't shoot anyone
while I'm gone.

18:37.742 --> 18:40.161
You didn't coach her?

18:40.244 --> 18:43.122
No amount of coaching
can do that.

18:46.751 --> 18:47.793
You recognize

18:47.918 --> 18:51.047
Marcy has a significant
intellectual disability.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.548
Yeah. "Had."

18:52.673 --> 18:54.675
You want to think
something wonderful's happened,

18:54.800 --> 18:56.344
but no traumatic brain injury

18:56.427 --> 18:58.679
is going to increase
intellectual capacity.

18:58.804 --> 18:59.805
It's just not possible.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.432
Which brings us back
to "miracle."

19:01.557 --> 19:03.726
Assuming that there was
a traumatic injury,

19:03.809 --> 19:05.561
likely a concussion,

19:05.686 --> 19:07.480
the most common symptoms
would be memory loss,

19:07.563 --> 19:08.606
change in personality--

19:08.689 --> 19:09.690
So...

19:09.774 --> 19:11.442
What if this is the real Marcy?

19:12.401 --> 19:13.277
Seriously?

19:13.361 --> 19:16.489
Up until the age of 18,
Marcy lived in an institution,

19:16.572 --> 19:19.075
one with a reputation
for neglect and abuse,

19:19.158 --> 19:21.702
right up until the time
it was shut down.

19:21.786 --> 19:23.079
She doesn't talk about that.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.830
Maybe the "Marcy" we knew

19:24.955 --> 19:26.707
was her way of coping there,

19:26.791 --> 19:29.085
her way of making people
look after her,

19:29.168 --> 19:31.712
and she just continued that
behavior after her release,

19:31.796 --> 19:33.130
and when she hit her head...

19:33.214 --> 19:35.341
She just forgot
who she was pretending to be?

19:35.424 --> 19:36.342
That's crazy.

19:36.467 --> 19:37.843
It's infinitely
more possible

19:37.968 --> 19:39.845
than her I.Q.
doubling overnight.

19:39.970 --> 19:41.847
I've been her caseworker
since her release.

19:41.972 --> 19:45.351
-That was over a year ago!
-My case in point.

19:45.476 --> 19:47.353
You got her
a subsidized apartment,

19:47.478 --> 19:49.105
a job at the library.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.524
You see her
four or five times a week--

19:51.607 --> 19:52.983
You're saying she played me?

19:53.067 --> 19:55.361
The most innocent soul
I've ever met.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.780
Played the system.
Fooled me, too.

19:57.863 --> 20:00.616
So she could live in a flophouse
full of crackheads,

20:00.700 --> 20:03.494
work nights at a library
for the rest of her adult life?

20:03.619 --> 20:05.121
No, you're right.
She's a mastermind.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.123
She's a James Bond villain.

20:07.248 --> 20:09.500
Neural pathways
can't spring up overnight.

20:09.625 --> 20:11.001
Vocabulary doesn't
come out of nowhere.

20:11.085 --> 20:12.837
And what's happened
to her stutter?

20:15.256 --> 20:17.216
Is something wrong?

20:18.843 --> 20:22.263
<i>"You're... a...</i>

20:22.388 --> 20:26.016
<i>big...</i>

20:26.100 --> 20:28.185
<i>girl...</i>

20:28.269 --> 20:29.895
<i>now,"</i>

20:30.020 --> 20:33.858
<i>said... Mary...</i>

20:36.736 --> 20:38.779

20:38.863 --> 20:40.948

20:41.031 --> 20:42.908
<i>Good.</i>

20:43.033 --> 20:45.161
Do you remember that?

20:46.537 --> 20:49.248
It was just a few months ago.

20:50.791 --> 20:52.918
I don't understand.

20:53.002 --> 20:54.170
Neither do we.

20:54.253 --> 20:58.549
I'd like to find out
what else you don't remember.

20:58.674 --> 21:00.593
It's okay... I'm here.

21:00.676 --> 21:02.678
Let's start with yesterday.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.680
Where were you?

21:04.764 --> 21:05.931
At the library.

21:06.807 --> 21:07.683
Good.

21:07.808 --> 21:09.685
What did you do
at the library?

21:09.810 --> 21:13.481
I'm a librarian, so I was...

21:13.564 --> 21:15.483
So you were
checking books in and out,

21:15.566 --> 21:17.985
helping folks find
what they were looking for?

21:18.068 --> 21:19.195
Yes.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.989
And can you name
one of those people?

21:22.072 --> 21:22.948
David.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.742
Uh, to do research.

21:24.825 --> 21:26.076
He's a reporter.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.703
Marcy, stop.

21:29.455 --> 21:31.540
What's wrong?

21:33.584 --> 21:36.086
You being a librarian,

21:36.212 --> 21:39.465
me going there to do research
for a newspaper I work for--

21:39.548 --> 21:41.592
those are all part
of a profile page

21:41.675 --> 21:43.219
that we made up.

21:43.344 --> 21:44.970
That's my profile.

21:45.054 --> 21:47.139
We created it as an exercise...

21:47.223 --> 21:50.226
so I could teach you
about social media

21:50.351 --> 21:52.353
and other things
about the world.

21:53.479 --> 21:55.481
Remember?

21:56.732 --> 21:58.234
You're not a librarian.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.902
You work there
as a cleaning lady.

21:59.985 --> 22:02.071
I'm not a reporter.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.242
I'm your social worker.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.914
So... so what...
you're saying is... that--

22:11.997 --> 22:14.124
We're just trying to understand.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.253
Marcy?

22:17.336 --> 22:18.504
Marce?

22:20.130 --> 22:22.091
- Marcy?
- Marcy!

22:28.514 --> 22:30.266
Take it you're not "Leticia."

22:30.391 --> 22:31.892
Wrong file.

22:33.978 --> 22:35.396
Go ahead, have a seat.

22:39.024 --> 22:39.984
Sit.

22:42.152 --> 22:45.656
You look like shit, Philip.
When was the last time you hit?

22:45.781 --> 22:47.408
-I don't use drugs.
-Come on, man.

22:47.491 --> 22:50.327
You don't have to pretend.
I know all about addiction.

22:50.411 --> 22:53.789
Trust me.
Mine's just legal.

22:53.914 --> 22:56.166
Have they talked
to you at all about

22:56.292 --> 22:58.043
the methadone program
they got going on?

22:58.168 --> 23:00.045
-What is it?
-Methadone?

23:00.170 --> 23:01.297
Your addiction.

23:04.008 --> 23:05.050
Is it gambling?

23:07.303 --> 23:09.221
Cigarettes.

23:09.305 --> 23:11.223
Look, I'm just trying
to be <i>simpatico</i> here.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.058
Don't be a dick.

23:13.142 --> 23:14.393
I apologize.

23:15.811 --> 23:18.188
We're gonna plea.
You'll end up doing some time.

23:18.272 --> 23:19.356
There's no way around that.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.692
They got you two ways,
all right?

23:21.817 --> 23:22.818
But, in the meantime--

23:22.943 --> 23:25.446
Are you bound by
attorney-client privilege?

23:25.571 --> 23:27.948
Can you guarantee
your confidence

23:28.073 --> 23:30.993
if I tell you information
that can help us both?

23:31.076 --> 23:33.162
Absolutely. What?

23:48.093 --> 23:49.803
I'm so sorry.

23:54.099 --> 23:56.727
Come on, you love...

23:56.810 --> 23:58.854
You love making up
after we fight.

23:58.937 --> 24:01.148
That wasn't a fight.
You struck me.

24:01.231 --> 24:04.526
If I hadn't demanded you leave,
you would've struck me again.

24:04.610 --> 24:07.738
From now on, you'll be allowed
to see your son once a day

24:07.863 --> 24:09.740
for one hour,
time to be arranged.

24:09.865 --> 24:11.742
I see him when I wanna see him.

24:11.867 --> 24:15.996
Also, you'll provide
proper financial support.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.498
Okay. Okay, okay.

24:17.623 --> 24:19.625
I get it.

24:19.750 --> 24:22.378
Let me make it up to you.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.254
What do you want me to do?

24:27.508 --> 24:29.259
Change Jeffrey's diaper.

24:39.019 --> 24:40.521
Hey! Phil!

24:41.772 --> 24:42.815
Hey.

24:42.898 --> 24:46.193
You got out quick.
What'd they tell you?

24:46.276 --> 24:48.404
They didn't say anything.
They just let me go.

24:48.487 --> 24:50.656
Come here, come here.
Come here for a sec.

24:55.661 --> 24:58.038
How did you know?

24:58.122 --> 25:00.082
Come on, man.
Three horses?

25:00.165 --> 25:01.792
Three races,
three different cities--

25:01.875 --> 25:03.669
all 20 to one or better?

25:03.752 --> 25:06.672
The bets were so stupid,
I had to go to three bookies.

25:06.755 --> 25:09.675
I wouldn't have done it if you
hadn't fronted the cash advance.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.969
It's all here, by the way,
with interest.

25:12.052 --> 25:14.430
Credit card's in there.

25:14.555 --> 25:15.973
Go ahead. Take it.

25:16.056 --> 25:17.057
Come on, come on.

25:20.561 --> 25:23.021
You gotta tell me.

25:24.189 --> 25:25.816
Do I still have
attorney-client privilege?

25:25.899 --> 25:27.693
Yeah, sure, whatever.
Yep. Yep.

25:28.902 --> 25:30.320
I'm from the future.

25:32.197 --> 25:34.199
Okay, I get it,
you can't tell me.

25:34.324 --> 25:37.703
But Phil...
you're gonna need me.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.580
The cops are gonna
be all over you.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.498
We gotta look after
each other here.

25:41.582 --> 25:42.833
All right?

25:42.958 --> 25:44.209
Oh, speaking of which--

25:44.293 --> 25:46.837
There's something extra in there
for you, from the lock-up.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.924
Just a little taste
so you don't get sick.

26:13.489 --> 26:14.823
David?

26:16.575 --> 26:17.826
There she is.

26:21.705 --> 26:23.499
What happened?

26:23.624 --> 26:27.252
Dr. Lee says you had a seizure.

26:27.336 --> 26:30.631
It's the diminished capacity.
There's too much pre-existing damage.

26:30.714 --> 26:32.049
What?

26:32.132 --> 26:33.634
How did I get--?

26:33.759 --> 26:36.011
We had to take you
to the hospital.

26:36.094 --> 26:37.805
You've been out of it all day.

26:37.888 --> 26:40.516
Soon as you feel up to it,
they wanna run tests--

26:40.599 --> 26:42.392
-No, please.
-It's not up to me.

26:42.518 --> 26:44.019
I can't be in the hospital.

26:44.102 --> 26:47.189
- Marcy.
- Listen to me.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.441
I have important work to do.

26:49.525 --> 26:50.692
At the library?

26:50.776 --> 26:54.321
No, not at the library.

26:54.404 --> 26:56.156
This is all happening
for a reason.

26:57.282 --> 26:58.534
Okay.

26:58.659 --> 27:02.246
How about I go get the doctor
and we can talk about this?

27:04.373 --> 27:05.791
Thank you.

27:05.916 --> 27:07.376
Okay.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.474
- Forbes.
<i>- Hey.</i>

28:04.600 --> 28:06.018
How's Judge What's-His-Nuts?

28:06.101 --> 28:09.146
Still an asshole.
How's our potential shooter?

28:09.229 --> 28:11.356
Jonas Walker hasn't
left his house in a week.

28:11.440 --> 28:13.984
Starting to think we're wasting
our time on that one.

28:14.109 --> 28:15.986
Our chatroom,
on the other hand,

28:16.111 --> 28:18.989
has been filling up all day
with the same weird messages.

28:19.114 --> 28:20.782
I.P.s all over town.

28:20.866 --> 28:21.992
<i>You think it's something?</i>

28:22.117 --> 28:24.870
Gotta admit,
it's making me curious.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.413
The one who set up the chatroom

28:26.496 --> 28:28.457
was arrested
and released on a technicality.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.792
Might save time if you contact
the arresting officer.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.753
<i>Name's Gower.</i>

28:32.836 --> 28:35.130
Okay. Bright and early.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.571
Marcy, what're you doing here?

28:59.655 --> 29:01.657
I was at your apartment!
I've been worried!

29:01.782 --> 29:04.284
I didn't know where else to go.

29:04.368 --> 29:06.286
What is going on?

29:07.287 --> 29:08.288
Tell me.

29:08.372 --> 29:10.415
I can't.

29:10.499 --> 29:11.541
A mistake's been made,

29:11.667 --> 29:13.919
and I'm not sure
how to correct it.

29:14.002 --> 29:16.421
I don't even know if it can be.

29:17.339 --> 29:20.050
Just... know
that I'm playing a small part

29:20.133 --> 29:21.426
in something that's important.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.178
Well, what does that even mean?

29:23.262 --> 29:25.305
I couldn't explain it
if I tried.

29:25.389 --> 29:29.393
Please...
just trust me anyway.

30:01.300 --> 30:03.593
Morning.
Sorry to bother you so early.

30:03.719 --> 30:05.971
I'm Special Agent Grant MacLaren
with the FBI.

30:06.096 --> 30:08.098
FBI? Really?

30:08.181 --> 30:09.474
Really.

30:09.558 --> 30:11.852
A message was sent
from this I.P. address--

30:11.935 --> 30:14.271
that just means one of
the computers in your house--

30:14.354 --> 30:15.981
kinda raised
a flag in our system.

30:16.106 --> 30:18.358
Please tell me
this is not about Internet porn.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.361
No. Not porn. At least,
I-I don't think so.

30:21.445 --> 30:24.656
No, this is more
of a chatroom conversation.

30:24.740 --> 30:28.493
Ah. My son's always
in those rooms.

30:28.618 --> 30:30.871
Is he a gamer, by any chance?
Video games?

30:30.996 --> 30:32.539
It's all he ever does.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.876
That, and the other thing.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.502
When do you expect him home?

30:37.586 --> 30:40.380
Said he'd be out
late tonight with friends.

30:40.464 --> 30:43.050
Is he in any kind of trouble?

30:43.133 --> 30:46.011
Nah. I doubt it.
You have a good day.

30:59.399 --> 31:01.443
Hey. What're you doing here?

31:01.526 --> 31:02.527
What do you mean?

31:02.652 --> 31:03.779
You got a free ticket

31:03.862 --> 31:06.156
to stay home
for the rest of the year.

31:06.281 --> 31:07.949
And fail to graduate?

31:08.033 --> 31:09.534
Yeah,
like that was gonna happen!

31:09.659 --> 31:12.037
Can I ask you something
without telling everyone?

31:12.120 --> 31:13.205
-Yeah.
-Honestly?

31:13.288 --> 31:16.792
-Yeah, God, what is it?
-Which locker is mine?

31:16.875 --> 31:18.293
Holy shit.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.170
You mean you got,
like, brain damage?

31:20.253 --> 31:21.797
Post-concussion syndrome.

31:22.923 --> 31:24.299
Yeah.

31:24.424 --> 31:26.802
It's, uh...
it's right here.

31:31.306 --> 31:33.100
You want me
to show you the combo?

31:33.183 --> 31:34.518
Please.

31:48.949 --> 31:49.950
Hey.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.993
Why is this body
always so tired?

31:52.077 --> 31:53.995
"This body"?

31:54.079 --> 31:56.498
Well, maybe
'cause it works nights.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.834
This body just made breakfast.

31:58.959 --> 32:00.127
That's very kind.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.212
And you're naked again.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.340
Okay.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.467
How about you get dressed
before joining me?

32:10.220 --> 32:11.096
David?

32:13.598 --> 32:16.726
If I could tell you, I would.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.980
Hey, as long as
you're not an assassin

32:20.105 --> 32:24.025
or a Hollywood actress
researching a character.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.861
Those--
Those are the...

32:25.986 --> 32:27.904
two worst-case scenarios
I came up with

32:27.988 --> 32:29.739
while I was laying
awake all night.

32:44.254 --> 32:46.006
<i>Gower.</i>

32:46.131 --> 32:47.883
Morning.
Grant MacLaren, FBI.

32:47.966 --> 32:51.553
I'm investigating a 20-year-old
male you booked yesterday--

32:51.636 --> 32:53.555
-Philip Pearson, yeah.
-That's him.

32:53.638 --> 32:56.516
<i>Well, I guess you heard he won</i>
<i>the lottery yesterday, huh?</i>

32:56.600 --> 32:59.769
-You had to drop the charges?
-No, he won the fucking lottery.

32:59.853 --> 33:02.022
<i>Six numbers outta seven.</i>
<i>92-grand and change.</i>

33:02.105 --> 33:03.273
Lucky kid.

33:03.356 --> 33:06.818
Not if I catch him with that bag of smack
he's walking around with.

33:06.902 --> 33:10.071
Our system red-flagged him as
a potential member of a terrorist cell.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.032
I got the rest of the suspects
covered,

33:12.115 --> 33:13.909
<i>but if you could watch</i>
<i>this one--</i>

33:14.034 --> 33:16.912
Agent MacLaren, there's no way
in hell this kid's a terrorist.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.664
Yeah? What were the odds
he was gonna win the lottery?

33:20.290 --> 33:21.666
Okay.

33:21.750 --> 33:23.793
Keep this number
and check in with me later.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.795
Tomorrow, he's all yours.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.554
Mm! You like that, sweetie?

33:39.684 --> 33:41.186
Yes?

33:41.269 --> 33:44.189
Special Agent MacLaren
of the FBI.

33:44.272 --> 33:46.942
-Sorry to bother you.
-"MacLaren"?

33:47.067 --> 33:48.693
How can I help you?

33:48.777 --> 33:51.446
Our computer spits stuff out,
we have to follow it up.

33:51.530 --> 33:53.865
-Do you live here alone?
-With my son.

33:53.949 --> 33:56.326
-How old is he?
-Just over a year.

33:56.451 --> 33:59.454
So, no criminal record?

33:59.579 --> 34:00.455
Sorry.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.708
I probably
know the answer to this,

34:03.792 --> 34:07.212
but do you have plans
for later tonight downtown?

34:07.337 --> 34:09.965
No. No plans.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.801
You don't sound very sure.

34:14.553 --> 34:17.430
I was trying to decide
if you were asking me out.

34:17.514 --> 34:19.558
Uh, no.

34:19.641 --> 34:22.394
Me? I'm--
I'm busy tonight.

34:25.313 --> 34:26.273
Thanks for your time.

34:49.337 --> 34:50.880
Hey! Pearson!

34:50.964 --> 34:54.134
I wonder how much smack
you can buy with 90 grand.

34:54.217 --> 34:56.094
The money's for something else.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.306
Save me the trouble of following
you and just tell me.

35:03.852 --> 35:06.229
I'm financing a secret hideout.

35:07.355 --> 35:10.483
Sorry, kid, you're gonna
have to do better than that.

35:18.992 --> 35:21.244
You're welcome
to stay while I'm at work.

35:21.369 --> 35:24.372
-There's nothing in the fridge--
-I'll be out before you're home.

35:24.497 --> 35:27.000
I'd like to come back tonight,
if that's all right.

35:27.125 --> 35:29.002
It'll be late, though.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.004
I could come with you.

35:31.087 --> 35:35.133
No. No, you should
stay home tonight.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.511
The streets won't be safe.

35:40.263 --> 35:45.477
Wh-- What?
What's gonna happen?

35:47.395 --> 35:49.397
Oh, come on,
that's going too far.

35:49.481 --> 35:52.025
-I shouldn't have said anything.
-You can't expect me to--

35:58.657 --> 36:01.159
I'll be back
just after midnight.

36:02.744 --> 36:04.871
You're Batgirl, aren't you?

36:07.916 --> 36:09.542
Bye.

38:02.280 --> 38:03.782
Shit!

38:08.536 --> 38:10.205
Come here.

38:10.288 --> 38:11.790
You're welcome.

38:11.873 --> 38:14.125
Get in. Let's go.
Come on.

38:15.919 --> 38:19.422
Had to pay a kid to dare a kid
to get Gower off your ass.

38:19.547 --> 38:21.341
Watching your back's
getting expensive, Philip.

38:21.424 --> 38:24.052
-What do you want in return?
-Today's bet.

38:24.177 --> 38:25.470
I can't do it.

38:25.553 --> 38:28.181
Yesterday, you gave me three.
I'm only asking for one.

38:28.306 --> 38:29.307
Yesterday was an emergency.

38:29.432 --> 38:31.726
Today's kind of
an emergency for me.

38:31.810 --> 38:35.063
Then you are a very bad gambler.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.732
Yeah, I'm a bad gambler...

38:46.533 --> 38:48.451
Maybe you'd like
to think about it.

38:48.535 --> 38:50.578
Get out.

38:56.668 --> 38:58.461
Pearson! Come here!

39:16.980 --> 39:18.982
-Where are you going?
-Out.

39:19.107 --> 39:20.733
With that guy?

39:28.825 --> 39:30.285
I don't have time for this.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.744
Well, make time.

39:35.707 --> 39:36.749
Okay! Damn it.

39:36.875 --> 39:38.877
Last warning.

39:39.961 --> 39:40.837
Okay.

40:01.149 --> 40:04.152
Hey! Hey!

40:08.615 --> 40:10.783
Pearson! Stop!

40:12.619 --> 40:14.621
Come on! Stop!

40:18.166 --> 40:20.168
It's a good thing
you stopped, kiddo.

40:24.422 --> 40:28.092
If I had to climb that fence,
I was gonna have a heart attack.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.679
You're having one right now.

40:31.804 --> 40:32.805
Oh, shut up.

40:32.931 --> 40:36.559
I just need to catch my breath,
that's all.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.563
Ooh!

40:40.647 --> 40:42.857
Maybe you're right.

40:42.941 --> 40:45.318
My phone--
it's in the car.

40:45.401 --> 40:47.570
-Help me.
-I can't, Mr. Gower.

40:47.695 --> 40:50.490
Then find someone
with a phone!

40:50.573 --> 40:51.741
I can't, I'm sorry.

40:51.824 --> 40:54.202
You can. I won't
come after you, I promise.

40:54.285 --> 40:55.954
You're supposed to die
this afternoon.

40:56.037 --> 40:57.830
No, you don't know--

40:57.914 --> 41:00.500
I knew the moment
that I heard your name.

41:00.583 --> 41:03.836
-I just didn't know I'd be here.
-Call 911 and go!

41:03.962 --> 41:07.966
Because we considered you
as a host.

41:08.049 --> 41:10.718
The heart attack
was inevitable within days.

41:12.220 --> 41:15.223
No... I'm okay.

41:18.726 --> 41:20.812
I think I'm okay.

41:55.263 --> 41:56.806
Hello?

41:56.889 --> 41:59.642
- <i>David Mailer?</i>
- Yeah?

41:59.726 --> 42:01.936
Special Agent
Grant MacLaren with the FBI.

42:02.020 --> 42:04.856
I came by earlier,
left a card under your door.

42:06.024 --> 42:07.900
Oh, sorry, I didn't, uh...

42:08.026 --> 42:10.653
-I didn't see it.
-Not a problem.

42:10.737 --> 42:12.321
Just following up
on a chatroom message

42:12.405 --> 42:14.782
that was sent from
your I.P. address last night.

42:14.866 --> 42:16.659
You mean my computer?

42:16.784 --> 42:19.412
<i>Right. Tell me, do you have</i>
<i>plans to meet anyone tonight</i>

42:19.537 --> 42:21.205
downtown,
on the 12th floor

42:21.289 --> 42:23.916
of an abandoned building,
about 11:17?

42:24.000 --> 42:26.169
No. Why--
Why would I do that?

42:26.252 --> 42:28.713
I guess that means
I won't be seeing you there.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.173
I'm just thinking out loud,

42:30.298 --> 42:32.925
but sometimes I let neighbors
use my Wi-Fi. Maybe that's, um--

42:33.051 --> 42:36.179
Well, that's a federal offense,
Mr. Mailer.

42:38.639 --> 42:39.557
Is it?

42:39.682 --> 42:41.893
No. I'm kidding.
Have a good evening.

43:27.688 --> 43:29.232
No. I'm not pressing charges.

43:29.315 --> 43:31.651
I just want to know
where she took it.

43:31.734 --> 43:34.195
Well, just check
and keep your mouth shut.

43:38.616 --> 43:40.618
All right. Thanks.

43:59.011 --> 44:00.388
Hello?

44:00.513 --> 44:03.432
I'm-- I'm trying to reach
Detective Gower.

44:03.516 --> 44:05.643
I thought this was his--

44:06.727 --> 44:08.563
Jesus, I'm sorry to hear that.

44:08.646 --> 44:12.275
No, it's-it's not important.
Um, thank you.

44:39.051 --> 44:40.761
Carly?

45:13.586 --> 45:15.212
Carly?

46:35.418 --> 46:36.794
Got you.

46:51.308 --> 46:52.935
You're actually all here.

46:53.894 --> 46:55.354
We've been waiting for you.

46:55.438 --> 46:56.689
Uh-huh.

46:56.772 --> 46:58.065
Where's the social worker?

46:58.190 --> 47:00.818
-David isn't one of us.
-One of--?

47:00.901 --> 47:02.820
We're travelers from the future,
Agent MacLaren.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.822
In our time,
many years from now,

47:04.947 --> 47:07.700
humanity's been
all but wiped out.

47:07.825 --> 47:09.326
We've come back to change that.

47:09.410 --> 47:12.747
There are thousands of travelers
already here taking part.

47:13.372 --> 47:14.665
Huh.

47:15.958 --> 47:19.378
Okay, what do you say
we, uh, travel downstairs

47:19.462 --> 47:20.963
and talk about this
somewhere else?

47:21.088 --> 47:22.089
It's not safe here.

47:27.219 --> 47:28.345
60 seconds.

47:28.429 --> 47:29.722
Till what?

47:29.805 --> 47:31.932
In the future,
we've developed a technology

47:32.016 --> 47:35.728
that allows a traveler to project his
or her conscious mind into a host body

47:35.811 --> 47:40.149
by knowing the precise time, elevation,
latitude, and longitude of their death.

47:40.232 --> 47:41.150
"T.E.L.L."

47:41.233 --> 47:42.485
A Traveler's consciousness

47:42.610 --> 47:45.154
arrives moments before
that historical time of death,

47:45.237 --> 47:47.615
overriding
the original host's mind,

47:47.698 --> 47:50.493
then resumes his or her life
by using their knowledge

47:50.576 --> 47:52.244
of historical records
and social media.

47:52.328 --> 47:53.662
Okay, that's enough bullshit
for now--

47:53.746 --> 47:55.748
-30 seconds.
-Wait.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.833
Who the hell is that?

47:59.210 --> 48:02.004
That's the body of Jonas Walker.

48:03.255 --> 48:05.299
We stopped him from going
on a shooting rampage,

48:05.382 --> 48:09.386
as you tried and failed to do,
between 11:14 and 11:17.

48:09.512 --> 48:10.638
20 seconds.

48:10.721 --> 48:12.807
We know the events of tonight

48:12.890 --> 48:14.266
because for us,
they've already happened.

48:14.391 --> 48:16.018
Just as we know
during a blackout,

48:16.102 --> 48:18.312
at 11:17,
in pursuit of Jonas Walker,

48:18.395 --> 48:19.772
Special Agent Grant MacLaren

48:19.897 --> 48:22.066
fell 45 meters
down an open elevator shaft

48:22.149 --> 48:24.151
to his death.

48:24.276 --> 48:25.653
Three seconds.

48:43.295 --> 48:46.090
Aah!

48:58.686 --> 49:00.396
I see we all made it.

49:03.816 --> 49:06.694
Let's begin.
