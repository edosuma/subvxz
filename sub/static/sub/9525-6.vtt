WEBVTT

00:00.416 --> 00:02.544
Okay, we can relax with pep.

00:02.710 --> 00:04.995
And then add a little Jeff garlic

00:05.120 --> 00:07.364
to curb the enthusiasm of the...

00:07.489 --> 00:10.552
Lawry's!

00:10.718 --> 00:13.937
Hello, sir!

00:14.062 --> 00:15.549
Yeah, how are you, dad?

00:15.674 --> 00:18.442
I'm just at the house
going over some business stuff.

00:18.567 --> 00:20.444
- You know, working overtime.
- Oh!

00:20.569 --> 00:22.779
Shipment has arrived!

00:22.904 --> 00:24.448
Karl took a salt pellet to the chest

00:24.573 --> 00:25.749
trying to get it too!

00:26.025 --> 00:28.111
Oh!
Ders, a little help, bud.

00:28.277 --> 00:30.954
Ye I...
This weekend?

00:31.079 --> 00:33.523
No, not ideal for me.

00:33.648 --> 00:35.125
You booked the ticket?

00:35.250 --> 00:36.626
Oh, [bleep].
We're gonna rip his head off.

00:36.751 --> 00:38.128
Well, break the face off
or something.

00:38.253 --> 00:38.747
Okay.

00:38.913 --> 00:41.164
No, that was just, um...
That was a TV.

00:41.289 --> 00:43.408
I'm watching some...
<i>Mad Money,</i>

00:43.533 --> 00:45.712
and you know how crazy
that guy can get.

00:45.878 --> 00:47.673
Hey, guys, we got a change of plans.

00:47.839 --> 00:51.009
Grab a sponge, man.
We gotta soap this bovine down.

00:51.175 --> 00:52.642
Yeah, come on, Ders.
Don't just stand there.

00:52.767 --> 00:54.429
We gotta jerk this beef, man.

00:54.595 --> 00:56.640
- Adam?
- Yeah.

00:56.806 --> 00:58.767
Look, guys,
my dad's visiting tomorrow.

00:58.933 --> 01:01.103
That's rad!

01:01.269 --> 01:02.562
Man!

01:03.044 --> 01:05.856
Whoo!

01:06.023 --> 01:07.609
Oh, yeah!
Very heavy!

01:07.775 --> 01:10.612
Aah!
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

01:10.778 --> 01:12.280
Oh!

01:12.446 --> 01:14.741
Whoo!

01:14.907 --> 01:16.618
Can I borrow one of your towels?

01:16.784 --> 01:18.235
You're already using my towel.

01:18.360 --> 01:21.164
All of your towels were my towels.

01:21.330 --> 01:33.176
<font color="#3399FF">Sync and correction by Mlmlte</font>
<font color="#3399FF">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:33.342 --> 01:36.686
Man, that is so cool that
your dad is coming this weekend.

01:36.811 --> 01:38.054
Can't wait to meet the guy.

01:38.179 --> 01:39.766
No, Blake, it's obviously not.

01:39.932 --> 01:41.424
It's gonna be awesome!
Are you kidding?

01:41.549 --> 01:42.726
He gets to meet us,

01:42.851 --> 01:44.094
and then he gets to see the unveiling

01:44.219 --> 01:45.929
of your beef jerky company.

01:46.054 --> 01:47.430
That's like "the proudest
dad ever" moment right there.

01:47.555 --> 01:49.599
Yeah, meat jerking beef boys.

01:49.724 --> 01:51.067
- That's what we're naming it.
- Yeah.

01:51.192 --> 01:52.446
Incorporated maybe.
We're not sure.

01:52.694 --> 01:54.170
I haven't been truthful with my dad

01:54.295 --> 01:57.173
about any aspect of my lifestyle.

01:57.298 --> 01:59.745
Who cares, man?
Everybody lies to their dad.

01:59.911 --> 02:02.045
My dad still sends me checks
for space camp.

02:02.170 --> 02:04.875
I haven't been in like...
I never went.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.484
Dude, my dad's expectations
are way higher, all right?

02:07.609 --> 02:10.213
I had to tell him that
I was a VP at Telamericorp.

02:10.378 --> 02:11.239
I told him I play

02:11.364 --> 02:13.423
in an all-white squash league
on Sundays,

02:13.548 --> 02:16.386
and that I own my own home,
which I don't, clearly.

02:16.552 --> 02:17.928
I wouldn't even worry about.

02:18.053 --> 02:19.806
I'm sure your dad has huge heart.

02:19.972 --> 02:24.561
Probably has big old...
Schlonger as well, huh?

02:24.727 --> 02:26.469
- Does he?
- Oh, yeah!

02:26.594 --> 02:27.731
- Dad dicks?
- Maybe.

02:27.897 --> 02:29.733
Oh, dad dicks are huge, man.

02:29.899 --> 02:31.508
And from all the stories
I've heard about your dad,

02:31.633 --> 02:33.109
forget it.
That's a monster.

02:33.234 --> 02:34.644
Totally.

02:34.769 --> 02:36.146
That's a monster
just trapped in denim.

02:36.271 --> 02:37.514
I still remember
the first dad dick I saw.

02:37.639 --> 02:38.949
- Uh-huh.
- I was seven years old.

02:39.074 --> 02:40.317
It was at a warriors game.

02:40.442 --> 02:41.551
We were at one of those
horse troughs.

02:41.676 --> 02:43.205
- Oh, God!
- And I'm like...

02:43.371 --> 02:44.854
With a stream of just power.

02:44.979 --> 02:46.124
Growling next to you.

02:46.290 --> 02:47.250
- Yeah.
- And that's the thing.

02:47.416 --> 02:50.961
Dad dicks in the late '80s,
early '90s,

02:51.086 --> 02:52.596
- they were bigger.
- Yep.

02:52.721 --> 02:54.197
I think there's something
shrinking dad dicks.

02:54.322 --> 02:55.467
That should be on <i>20/20.</i>

02:55.633 --> 02:57.761
So what is your pops packing?

02:57.927 --> 03:00.303
- Okay, you wanna know?
- Yeah.

03:00.428 --> 03:01.938
I can't even remember...

03:02.063 --> 03:03.640
- He has a legit bat.
- Yeah.

03:03.765 --> 03:05.108
I'm not gonna lie.

03:05.233 --> 03:06.476
If I close my eyes,
I can see it right now.

03:06.601 --> 03:07.944
It's got the...
Goes a little...

03:08.069 --> 03:09.856
Oh, man, dad dicks, right?
Ooh, mama!

03:10.022 --> 03:11.381
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

03:11.506 --> 03:13.777
Hi. Um,
I'm Vanessa With McMillan Realty.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.487
We're holding an open house

03:15.653 --> 03:17.587
down the street on Sunday,

03:17.712 --> 03:20.490
and I would just absolutely loved
if you weren't

03:20.615 --> 03:22.619
drinking beers on the roof.

03:22.785 --> 03:24.794
Oh, right.
You got it, no problem.

03:24.919 --> 03:26.162
- Weed only!
- Yep.

03:26.287 --> 03:28.144
- Super blunt Sunday!
- Yep.

03:28.269 --> 03:30.710
Super bowl Sunday!
We'll just smoke bowls!

03:30.876 --> 03:32.769
Or maybe not be on the roof at all.

03:32.894 --> 03:34.714
Sound doable?
Thanks!

03:34.880 --> 03:38.426
- Did she just say open house?
- Yeah.

03:38.592 --> 03:40.804
Uh-oh.
Hey, I know that look.

03:40.970 --> 03:42.931
- I don't kn any of his looks.
- Excuse me, Banessa!

03:43.097 --> 03:45.392
- I'm sorry?
- It's Banessa, wasn't it?

03:45.558 --> 03:47.144
No, Va-nessa.

03:47.408 --> 03:50.120
No, I'm actually positive you
came up, you said, "Banessa."

03:50.245 --> 03:51.988
I thought it was a stupid me.

03:52.113 --> 03:53.733
But that's your name
and you should stick with it.

03:53.899 --> 03:56.393
Would like to make an offer

03:56.518 --> 03:57.794
to buy that house for the weekend.

03:57.919 --> 03:59.072
- Is that a thing?
- Oh

03:59.238 --> 04:00.630
we can talk when
I'm back in town Sunday

04:00.755 --> 04:02.298
for the open house.

04:02.423 --> 04:04.467
You'll see my sign.
It's says, "Va-nessa...

04:04.592 --> 04:05.869
With McMillan."

04:05.994 --> 04:07.144
'Kay, thanks again!

04:07.269 --> 04:08.505
- All right.
- Ohh.

04:09.964 --> 04:11.793
- Oh, I know that look.
- Yeah.

04:11.959 --> 04:13.743
I'm sorry, lady,
I don't wanna have sex with you

04:13.868 --> 04:15.512
unless you wanna have sex with me.

04:15.637 --> 04:17.757
- In that case, yes, I'll have sex with you.
- Game on.

04:27.682 --> 04:30.551

- Quiet. Shh.

04:32.787 --> 04:35.465
- It's locked.
- Shh. I got it.

04:35.590 --> 04:37.319
What are you doing?
Shh! Quiet.

04:37.485 --> 04:38.868
Dude!

04:38.993 --> 04:40.030
- Nope, that was...
- Yeah.

04:40.196 --> 04:41.705
Well, I don't know what to do

04:41.830 --> 04:43.039
just kidding.
Yeah, I do.

04:43.164 --> 04:44.367
- What are you doing?
- Shh. Quiet.

04:45.633 --> 04:47.746
- All right, well...
- Get it, just... okay.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.581
- Jesus.
- Shh. Quiet.

04:51.706 --> 04:54.184
<i>Hola...</i>
To the <i> Casa de Ders.</i>

04:54.309 --> 04:55.712
- Thank you.
- Get in there.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.755
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Hey.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.425
You sure this is a good idea, man?

05:00.591 --> 05:02.025
This place is nice.

05:02.150 --> 05:03.553
I don't wanna go to jail
for breaking that entering.

05:03.719 --> 05:05.222
Nobody's going to jail, dude.

05:05.787 --> 05:08.622
The use is staged, man.
It's a fake house, dude!

05:09.141 --> 05:10.133
Is is a good idea.

05:10.258 --> 05:11.568
If we get outta here
by Sunday, it's perfect.

05:11.693 --> 05:13.103
I mean, my dad's
here on business, right?

05:13.228 --> 05:14.537
So he's pressed for time.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.206
He'll come by the house, quick visit,

05:16.331 --> 05:17.640
then I'll take him to dinner,
back to the hotel,

05:17.765 --> 05:18.693
and he's back outta my life again.

05:18.859 --> 05:20.310
Yeah, all right.

05:20.435 --> 05:22.530
What do you say we Ders-sersify
this little peach pit?

05:22.696 --> 05:25.159
Yeah, this couch smells
nothing like you.

05:25.573 --> 05:26.868
You should rub your balls on it.

05:27.034 --> 05:28.161
Nah, I don't think I have to do that.

05:28.327 --> 05:29.788
Yeah, I'll start.
I'll start it off.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.331
All right.- Get this.

05:31.497 --> 05:32.958
I'll go [bleep] in the bathroom.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.991
You know, I didn't masturbate
until I was 18 years old?

05:35.116 --> 05:37.127
I would just have sex
with items around my house.

05:37.294 --> 05:39.095
Or just, like, put my clothes
in the closet.

05:39.220 --> 05:42.717
You know, we don't need to hump.
We don't need to go... poop.

05:42.883 --> 05:45.053
Yeah.
Welcome home.

05:45.219 --> 05:47.270
- Whoo!
- It smells good in here.

05:47.395 --> 05:48.671
All right, dudes,
he's gonna be here soon

05:48.796 --> 05:49.873
and the living room's almost...

05:49.998 --> 05:51.226
What the [bleep] are you wearing?

05:51.392 --> 05:54.410
Well, if you'd gone to see
<i>Retaliation</i>

05:54.535 --> 05:55.814
like you said you were going to,

05:56.070 --> 05:59.149
you would know that this
is my sergeant slaught outfit.

05:59.274 --> 06:01.903
And this is my very good friend
shipwreck.

06:02.069 --> 06:04.030
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:04.196 --> 06:05.027
Uh, got that.

06:05.152 --> 06:06.241
Why are you wearing them right now?

06:06.407 --> 06:08.825
You talked yourself up so big.

06:08.950 --> 06:10.493
We didn't want you to be best friends

06:10.618 --> 06:12.289
with a couple of doo-doo heads.

06:12.455 --> 06:13.915
Mm-mm.

06:14.081 --> 06:15.598
Yeah, so which one
of these rooms is mine?

06:15.723 --> 06:16.793
Because I got this necklace
of yours I wanna hang up.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.368
I don't know
how to break this to you...

06:18.493 --> 06:20.046
What should I call your dad?

06:20.212 --> 06:22.090
Should I call him Mr. Holmvik
or Ders' dad?

06:22.256 --> 06:23.383
Or just Papi?

06:23.665 --> 06:25.302
He likes it
when you call him big Papi.

06:25.468 --> 06:26.428
Look, you guys are not
gonna meet my dad!

06:26.594 --> 06:28.430
Okay?
I'm sorry.

06:28.596 --> 06:29.813
It's just that I told him
I live alone.

06:29.938 --> 06:30.900
And I'll be perfectly honest.

06:31.025 --> 06:32.225
He doesn't even know that you exist.

06:32.391 --> 06:34.684
How does he not know
your best friends exist?

06:34.809 --> 06:36.313
Okay, that's him.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.523
Please go.
Just go. Please?

06:38.689 --> 06:39.823
- That doesn't make...
- Are you that ashamed of us?

06:39.948 --> 06:41.491
Yes! Am ashamed of you.

06:41.616 --> 06:43.193
My dad is a big... dog,
and you guys are just pup...

06:43.318 --> 06:45.328
I am a wolf!
I am a big dog too!

06:45.453 --> 06:46.729
You're a porch puppy.
So are you.

06:46.854 --> 06:49.284
- That's racist.
- Okay, wow.

06:49.450 --> 06:51.286
- Dersy!
- Hey.

06:51.452 --> 06:54.372
Go!

06:54.538 --> 06:57.042
Oh. Good to see you, sir.
No, uh, rental?

06:57.208 --> 06:58.708
No jags, all malibus.

06:58.833 --> 07:00.243
- That's not a tough call.
- Right.

07:00.368 --> 07:01.544
I'm surprised you saw that

07:01.669 --> 07:02.964
with that mop of hair in your eyes.

07:03.130 --> 07:04.591
Right, well, I was, uh...
I was just gonna get...

07:04.757 --> 07:06.259

07:06.425 --> 07:07.635
And it's <i>so</i> good to see you!

07:07.801 --> 07:11.181
It's just been so long.

07:12.847 --> 07:14.517
That a long hug.

07:19.980 --> 07:24.092
{pub}- This is your first house.
- Yeah, this is all mine.

07:24.217 --> 07:26.295
I bought it, I live here.
It's really mine.

07:26.420 --> 07:28.363
But, uh, we should get going

07:28.488 --> 07:30.098
'cause I got the chef's table
at McCormick & Schmick's,

07:30.223 --> 07:31.600
and, uh, you know...

07:31.725 --> 07:33.402
Orange roughy sounds
like hell right now.

07:33.527 --> 07:35.288
We're Holmviks.
We're going to Morton's.

07:35.454 --> 07:37.406
Yeah, I need a beer.

07:37.531 --> 07:39.841
Yeah, um, let me see what I got.

07:39.966 --> 07:41.378
- There might...
- Well, what's the deal here?

07:41.544 --> 07:43.779
You know, I'm never home
'cause I'm always at, uh...

07:43.904 --> 07:45.314
Business dinners,
you know, making deals.

07:45.439 --> 07:47.215
Just wheelin' and dealin'.

07:47.340 --> 07:50.085
So, uh, yeah,
this is the main hallway here.

07:50.210 --> 07:52.120
Kind of a gallery.

07:52.245 --> 07:56.226
Um, and in here is, uh...

07:56.392 --> 08:00.729
This is my hot yoga studio.
Yeah.

08:00.896 --> 08:02.190
Wait, wait minute.

08:02.356 --> 08:04.166
I know what's going on here.

08:04.291 --> 08:06.361
You're prepping this place to sell.

08:06.527 --> 08:09.864
No, I'm... yeah, I'm gonna
sell this place, dad.

08:10.030 --> 08:11.239
Now I gotta hit the John.

08:11.364 --> 08:13.075
Make some room for that porterhouse.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.828
- You should too.
- I'll be all right.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.579
Just do it.
Okay.

08:17.804 --> 08:19.374
Whoo!

08:19.748 --> 08:22.117
Ooh. I say we leave is
as the cooling room.

08:22.242 --> 08:25.487
And then my room will be
a little jerk flavoring,

08:25.612 --> 08:28.223
jerking station without any jerking.

08:28.348 --> 08:29.884
I won't do that
if we hang the meat in there.

08:30.050 --> 08:31.845
That's a good call.
That's a good call, man.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.195
And I'm thinking we can use my room

08:33.320 --> 08:34.763
to house all the models

08:34.888 --> 08:36.683
for the meat jerking
beef boys girls calendar.

08:36.849 --> 08:39.735
Right? I say we sprinkle
some pepper over these babes,

08:39.860 --> 08:41.770
smother them in Teriyaki.

08:41.895 --> 08:44.232
It's like jerky, but jerky
that you wanna have sex with.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.151
Marinade 'em
and then masturbate to 'em.

08:46.317 --> 08:47.542
Sex jerky.
That'll sell.

08:47.667 --> 08:48.944
You're a freakin' genius, man.

08:49.069 --> 08:49.904
No, I know.
I know that.

08:50.070 --> 08:51.880
And that just proves my theory

08:52.005 --> 08:53.515
that Ders has been holding back
our super friendship

08:53.640 --> 08:54.784
this whole time.

08:54.950 --> 08:56.661
Let's hit this A.C.,
cool this bitch out.

08:56.827 --> 08:57.871
Good call.

08:58.445 --> 08:59.888
- Hit the fan, science guy.
- You got it, science bro.

09:00.013 --> 09:02.250
- Whoo! Plug this bitch in!
- You got it.

09:02.416 --> 09:05.060
All right, let's crank
some cow cuttin' tunes!

09:05.185 --> 09:06.862
I got you on that.
Here we go.

09:06.987 --> 09:08.214
Kick out the germs!

09:09.715 --> 09:10.758
- Whoo!
- Yeah!

09:10.924 --> 09:12.801
Nice.

09:12.968 --> 09:14.002
Yeah!

09:14.127 --> 09:15.904
Lopping off a piece.

09:16.029 --> 09:17.140
Agh!

09:17.306 --> 09:19.641
- Clean cut! Lean cut!
- Whoa!

09:19.766 --> 09:21.843
- Yeah, crank that bitch down.
- That's really hairy.

09:21.968 --> 09:23.750
That's okay, man.
Hair.

09:23.875 --> 09:25.148
It'll add some spice.
It'll add some seasoning.

09:25.314 --> 09:26.982
- All right.
- Gamy. A gamy taste.

09:27.107 --> 09:28.751
That's what our jerky's gonna be.

09:28.876 --> 09:31.553
It's gonna be a little gam...

09:31.678 --> 09:33.388
Okay.

09:33.513 --> 09:34.782
Well, n-n-now why did that happen?

09:34.948 --> 09:37.159
- Shoot.
- Probably it's just...

09:37.284 --> 09:38.703
Plugged up a little bit.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.580
Yeah, go for it.

09:40.746 --> 09:43.598
Whoa!

09:43.723 --> 09:45.167
One, two, three, four, five.

09:45.292 --> 09:46.294
- Yep, I'm all good to go.
- Okay, whew!

09:48.528 --> 09:50.924
Well, look who it is.

09:51.090 --> 09:53.008
If it isn't Judas priest...

09:53.133 --> 09:55.010
From the Bible, not the band.
'Cause that'd be cool.

09:55.177 --> 09:56.596
What are you guys doing here?

09:56.870 --> 09:58.380
Believe me, we don't like this
as much as you do.

09:58.505 --> 10:01.082
But we have a few questions
about <i>our</i> house.

10:01.207 --> 10:02.810
Our house...
Where we live, not you.

10:02.976 --> 10:04.812
Dersy! Dersy!
You're out of T.P.

10:04.978 --> 10:06.688
Luckily, I had a clean pinch.

10:06.855 --> 10:08.566
- Right, um...
- Whoa.

10:08.732 --> 10:10.358
What up?
Hey!

10:10.483 --> 10:13.128
I'm Adam.
It's great to finally meet you.

10:13.253 --> 10:14.447
We live right over there.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.032
How's it going?

10:16.198 --> 10:17.399
It's a pleasure to meet you, sir.

10:17.524 --> 10:18.867
- It's very nice to meet you.
- Thor.

10:19.034 --> 10:19.953
Thor Holmvik.

10:20.119 --> 10:22.247
Thor?
Your name is Thor?

10:22.729 --> 10:24.372
Ah! That is so...

10:24.497 --> 10:25.607
I didn't know white people
had cool names anymore.

10:25.732 --> 10:28.002
He has a God's name.

10:28.168 --> 10:29.837
Tell me you named your dick
"Thor's hammer."

10:30.003 --> 10:32.006
- Nope, he doesn't.
- You have to at that point.

10:32.172 --> 10:33.615
You have to.
If you're named Thor?

10:33.740 --> 10:35.708
You definitely hit 'em
with the hammer, baby.

10:36.093 --> 10:37.136
Rad.

10:37.444 --> 10:39.554
Okay, I think, uh, you guys
should get going, right?

10:39.679 --> 10:41.349
You need to go, probably?

10:41.515 --> 10:43.258
Actually, since our houses
have similar layouts,

10:43.383 --> 10:45.060
I was wondering if I could
ask you a question.

10:45.185 --> 10:46.394
Where's your fuse box?

10:46.519 --> 10:48.630
And also how do you de-blow a fuse?

10:48.755 --> 10:50.191
Is that a thing?
Do you de-blow it?

10:50.357 --> 10:51.818
It's probably in the hallway.

10:51.984 --> 10:53.835
Okay, so where would it...

10:53.960 --> 10:55.363
Where would it be in our house then?

10:55.529 --> 10:57.873
Could be behind that Van Halen poster

10:57.998 --> 11:00.702
above the glade plug-in
in <i>your</i> house.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.310
Okay, so your fuse
is in your hallway.

11:02.435 --> 11:04.789
We're talking about <i>our</i> house.

11:04.955 --> 11:06.040
Good luck with the fuse box.

11:06.206 --> 11:07.616
- Great to meet you.
- Hold on!

11:07.741 --> 11:08.984
We'd like to play
apples to apples with Thor!

11:09.109 --> 11:10.044
No! Just get out of here.

11:10.210 --> 11:12.320
It's a good thing you're moving.

11:12.445 --> 11:14.591
With those two bisexual tweekers
living across the street,

11:14.757 --> 11:17.385
might as well be living
in a goddamn condominium.

11:17.551 --> 11:18.727
Yeah, um...

11:18.852 --> 11:20.972
What makes you say they're bisexual?

11:26.960 --> 11:28.904
Does this happen often?

11:29.029 --> 11:31.190
Well, you know,
it's part of the charm.

11:31.356 --> 11:32.107
It's mom's old 'Vo.

11:32.232 --> 11:33.651
It keeps me humble.

11:33.817 --> 11:34.976
Well, excuse me.

11:35.101 --> 11:36.613
You're a Holmvik, not a Humblevik.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.947
You finally got something
not to be humble about.

11:39.072 --> 11:39.866
Right.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.743
Okay, we're going
to the Volvo dealership.

11:41.909 --> 11:44.370
Well, I think we'll go
to dinner, and then after...

11:44.536 --> 11:45.035
No, after dinner,

11:45.160 --> 11:46.431
you're gonna be cresting
a buck thirty

11:46.556 --> 11:47.999
in your brand-new
black vagina finder.

11:48.165 --> 11:49.131
OK, well...

11:49.256 --> 11:51.711
You know, I think black cars
attract a lot of heat, so...

11:51.877 --> 11:53.728
I wasn't talking about the car.

11:53.853 --> 11:57.232
Have you seen that b.E.T. Network?

11:57.357 --> 12:00.068
Can't believe that selfish
bitch is keeping his dad

12:00.193 --> 12:02.170
- all to himself.
- Ah!

12:02.295 --> 12:04.973
- He's being a little bitch.
- Selfish little bitch, man.

12:05.098 --> 12:07.242
You can't keep Thor
from all the mortals.

12:07.367 --> 12:08.478
He belongs to us.

12:08.935 --> 12:10.445
Yeah, well, at least
we have a at locker now.

12:10.729 --> 12:12.414
Dude, if he were here right now,
I'd be like...

12:12.539 --> 12:13.748
Yeah.

12:13.873 --> 12:14.942
Yeah!

12:15.375 --> 12:17.419
Yeah, I'd be like,
"hey, oh, hi, Ders.

12:17.544 --> 12:19.578
Oh, yeah, buh-bye, Ders!"

12:23.349 --> 12:25.453
Oh, split your head open,
more like it!

12:25.619 --> 12:27.121
And then you die!

12:27.287 --> 12:28.797
"Hey, where's this guy's butthole?"

12:28.922 --> 12:29.998
I'm gonna be, "right there."

12:30.123 --> 12:31.466
And he's gonna be like,

12:31.591 --> 12:33.301
"well, I'm gonna dive on
into your ass!"

12:33.585 --> 12:36.404
How about you show us a little
r-e-s-pee in your mouth?

12:36.529 --> 12:38.640
What! Hey, no, stop!

12:38.765 --> 12:40.408
Hey, we have to eat that!

12:40.533 --> 12:41.843
It's hard to stop once you start.

12:41.968 --> 12:43.144
- Okay.
- All right.

12:43.269 --> 12:44.346
- No, get it. Get it.
- All right.

12:44.471 --> 12:46.548
Okay, whoo!

12:46.673 --> 12:48.083
All right, well,
we'll go get some bleach.

12:48.208 --> 12:50.151
A little Lawry's seasoning, right?

12:50.276 --> 12:51.920
Yeah.

12:52.045 --> 12:53.731
- Seasoning, yes.
- Sorry.

12:53.897 --> 12:56.591
Hey, you know, before we,
uh, jump the gun here,

12:56.716 --> 12:59.628
I was looking at this certified
pre-ned wagon over there.

12:59.903 --> 13:00.996
That could be kinda cool...
A shaggin' wagon.

13:01.121 --> 13:02.831
I understand your hesitation.

13:02.956 --> 13:04.833
You've got all this money now,
and you're wondering,

13:04.958 --> 13:06.468
"should I really be flaunting this

13:06.593 --> 13:08.603
- when so many have so little?"
- Yeah, exactly.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.438
And the answer is yes.

13:10.563 --> 13:13.265
Goddamn, you're gonna get
some wild tail in this car.

13:13.542 --> 13:14.476
Don't I know it?

13:14.601 --> 13:16.711
I mean, I probably would...
I will...

13:16.836 --> 13:19.507
You know, we need to celebrate.

13:19.673 --> 13:21.383
I'm gonna cancel
all my business appointments

13:21.508 --> 13:23.184
and I'm gonna be bunking with my boy

13:23.468 --> 13:25.344
on his beautiful oriental couch.

13:25.679 --> 13:26.988
I'd like your room,

13:27.113 --> 13:28.657
but a Holmvik never sleeps
in another man's bed.

13:28.782 --> 13:29.748
Yeah, no.
I know.

13:30.017 --> 13:31.793
Sir...

13:31.918 --> 13:36.698
I can't... go on just not
saying this so, um...

13:36.823 --> 13:38.423
No, no, no.
No. No. No!

13:38.692 --> 13:40.793
There's something I need to tell <i>you.</i>

13:41.069 --> 13:44.363
I am proud of you, Anders.

13:46.000 --> 13:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

14:13.268 --> 14:15.438
{pub}I figured there'd be
a lot less blood.

14:15.604 --> 14:16.913
Yeah, me too.

14:17.038 --> 14:18.248
I didn't realize there was
so much blood in a cow.

14:18.373 --> 14:20.083
Very evolved process.

14:20.208 --> 14:21.518
Oh, my God!

14:21.643 --> 14:23.086
What is that smell?

14:23.211 --> 14:25.114
Well... it's the blood, Anders.

14:25.280 --> 14:26.699
There's blood everywhere.

14:26.865 --> 14:28.576
And guts.
It's jerky. It's pre-jerky.

14:28.742 --> 14:30.026
Okay, whatever, dude.
I got an emergency.

14:30.151 --> 14:31.454
My dad's trying to crash at my ace.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.039
He's not going to a hotel.

14:33.205 --> 14:35.041
The open house tomorrow
is totally gonna blow my cover.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.733
Oh, you poor little baby bitch.

14:36.858 --> 14:38.201
What's the matter?

14:38.326 --> 14:39.295
Dad Thor kick you
out of the Avengers?

14:39.461 --> 14:41.047
Sorry, we're the X-Men.

14:41.213 --> 14:42.800
You must be looking for x-friends.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.008
I think they're down the road.

14:44.174 --> 14:45.875
Yeah, like we would ever help you out

14:46.000 --> 14:46.928
- in a "quimillion" years.
- Not happening.

14:47.094 --> 14:47.929
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.472
Why would we ever help you, dude?

14:49.638 --> 14:51.808
Because I'm gonna give you
my Brazzers password.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.476
Fine, we'll be the bigger men here.

14:53.642 --> 14:54.584
Here's what I'm thinking.

14:54.709 --> 14:55.761
You guys should come by the house,

14:55.886 --> 14:56.646
make it look like there's a break-in,

14:56.812 --> 14:58.773
just tip over some chairs,
empty a drawer or two.

14:59.147 --> 15:01.122
Just enough to freak him out
so he goes and stays at a hotel.

15:01.247 --> 15:01.776
You know what I mean?

15:04.486 --> 15:06.322
We want that password first though.

15:06.488 --> 15:07.406
That's not gonna happen.

15:07.572 --> 15:09.158
Strong move.
We'll do it your way.

15:10.295 --> 15:11.296
Okay.

15:13.445 --> 15:14.914
- Okay, now just watch me.
- Yeah.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.749
- All right?
- Oh!

15:16.915 --> 15:18.432
- Watch me.
- Yeah!

15:18.959 --> 15:19.960
Okay.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.515
Yeah, we're good to go.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.308
His wallet.

15:34.474 --> 15:37.019
You know, maybe we're being
too hard on Ders, man.

15:37.185 --> 15:39.205
He just... loves his dad
a weird amount.

15:39.330 --> 15:41.524
Yeah, you know,
it's gotta mess with his head.

15:41.690 --> 15:43.566
His dad is just swinging
Thor's hammer,

15:43.691 --> 15:45.862
and you know, Ders is working
on that little ice pick.

15:46.028 --> 15:47.737
It's a big dick to live up to.

15:47.862 --> 15:52.208
But no giant dad [bleep]
in the world can explain this.

15:52.492 --> 15:55.037
<i>G.I. Joe: Retaliation</i> ticket stab.

15:55.203 --> 15:56.497
He saw it without us!

15:56.871 --> 15:58.958
I don't know whether to cry
or explode from anger.

15:59.124 --> 16:00.550
You know what, I don't even care

16:00.675 --> 16:02.919
how many freakin' passwords
that guy gives us.

16:03.044 --> 16:04.922
We should be ashamed of him!

16:05.088 --> 16:07.814
Oh, I'm so <i>ashamed</i>
toe that dude's friend.

16:08.091 --> 16:08.885
Yeah, we're good friends!

16:09.051 --> 16:10.386
I'm proud to be your friend, man!

16:10.552 --> 16:11.596
I'm proud to be <i>your</i> friend!

16:11.762 --> 16:12.847
I'm ashamed of that dude!

16:13.013 --> 16:14.557
That guy sucks
and he doesn't appreciate us.

16:14.723 --> 16:16.467
Yeah, that dude
doesn't appreciate me.

16:16.592 --> 16:18.167
Doesn't appreciate me,
doesn't appreciate...

16:18.292 --> 16:20.136
- I appreciate this!
- Doesn't appreciate!

16:20.261 --> 16:22.064
- How about you appreciate this?
- Oh!

16:22.230 --> 16:24.641
How about appreciate this?
[bleep]!

16:24.766 --> 16:25.660
He'll appreciate that.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.443
- Yeah.
- Oh, hi, Ders.

16:27.568 --> 16:29.545
Where's your little baby dick now?

16:29.670 --> 16:31.184
Where's your little baby dick now?

16:31.309 --> 16:32.849
Uh, is there a hide-a-bed in here?

16:32.974 --> 16:34.317
- That is very heavy.
- No, this is...

16:34.442 --> 16:35.318
Let's find something else to break.

16:35.443 --> 16:36.519
Okay.

16:36.644 --> 16:37.413
Whoa, hang on, hang on.
Hang on.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.593
- What? What?
- The door.

16:38.718 --> 16:39.957
Dad, I think I've been robbed.

16:40.123 --> 16:41.533
- What's going on?
- We need to be careful.

16:41.658 --> 16:43.570
Let's just get your stuff.
We'll get you back to the hotel.

16:43.695 --> 16:44.929
It's definitely not safe here, dad.

16:45.054 --> 16:46.562
- Come on.
- Dad!

16:46.687 --> 16:48.007
We've been robbed!

16:48.923 --> 16:50.885
- Oh, my God.
- What the hell's going on?

16:51.051 --> 16:54.180
This isn't what I...
Expected to come home to.

16:54.346 --> 16:56.724
Uh, dad, I'm gonna
call the cops real quick.

16:56.890 --> 16:58.775
Adam, do not send me to voicemail.

16:58.900 --> 17:01.187
Pick up your phone.
Th is not cool, all right?

17:12.239 --> 17:16.726
All right, dad, they're gonna
send over the CSI guys to, um...

17:16.851 --> 17:19.028
You know, lo for prints, or...

17:19.153 --> 17:21.540
Uh... pubes or fibers
or whatever. Dad?

17:21.705 --> 17:24.460
Y, dad?

17:24.626 --> 17:26.045
Oh, no.

17:26.211 --> 17:27.704
Hello!

17:27.829 --> 17:31.092
I know you weedheads
are up to something!

17:44.980 --> 17:48.401
California.
Land of fruits and nuts.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.117
{pub}Thor! Hey!

17:56.283 --> 17:57.910
- What's going on here.
- Whoa!

17:58.076 --> 17:59.245
You sickos!

17:59.494 --> 18:00.771
Oh, shoot.
He's got Thor's hammer!

18:00.896 --> 18:02.289
He's got two Thor's hammers.

18:02.455 --> 18:03.907
Sir, no!
Please!

18:04.032 --> 18:05.442
These two perverts robbed you...

18:05.567 --> 18:07.744
And made some sort of sick voodoo,

18:07.869 --> 18:09.463
bisexual Jack-off shrine.

18:09.629 --> 18:11.548
No, sir, trust me.
No one's jacked-off in here.

18:11.715 --> 18:12.800
You've never jacked-off in here?

18:12.966 --> 18:15.018
Yeah, I Jack-off in here, but no...

18:15.302 --> 18:16.137
Okay, so have I.

18:16.678 --> 18:17.821
I'm trying to tell him...
Sir, this is...

18:17.946 --> 18:19.389
This is my bedroom.

18:19.514 --> 18:21.517
- This is the house I live in.
- What?

18:21.683 --> 18:23.160
Yeah, I've been lying to you
about my job,

18:23.285 --> 18:24.537
about where I live,

18:24.662 --> 18:26.856
and these two bisexual tweekers
are...

18:27.022 --> 18:28.190
These are my best friends.

18:28.356 --> 18:29.499
Best friends, huh?

18:29.624 --> 18:31.235
That's funny because

18:31.360 --> 18:34.004
why'd you ditch us
and go see <i>Retaliation</i> solo?

18:34.129 --> 18:35.372
Ticket stub right here.

18:35.655 --> 18:36.840
Look, guys, come on.

18:36.965 --> 18:39.142
You were dressed
in full G.I. Joe Regalia.

18:39.267 --> 18:40.911
It's a channing tatum vie.

18:41.036 --> 18:42.913
There's gonna be down babes there.

18:43.079 --> 18:45.015
Actually, you're right.
I never even thought about that.

18:45.140 --> 18:46.959
We should be better
at this kinda stuff, like girls.

18:47.125 --> 18:48.419
It wasn't cool of me.
I'm sorry.

18:48.585 --> 18:50.087
Apology accepted...

18:50.253 --> 18:52.715
Anders, son of Thor.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.258
Actually...

18:54.383 --> 18:57.194
I have a little secret myself.

18:57.319 --> 18:59.096
Oh, my God.
Tell me he's gay.

18:59.221 --> 19:00.664
I've always wanted
to be around someone

19:00.789 --> 19:02.141
when they come out of the closet.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.601
I lost my job three months ago.

19:04.476 --> 19:05.644
Haven't told a soul.

19:06.359 --> 19:08.064
It's bad, Dersy.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.774
We may lose the house.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.233
Oh, my God.

19:12.525 --> 19:16.155
The lake house.
Sorry about the pause.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.408
- Oh.
- Very misleading, Mr. Thor.

19:19.574 --> 19:21.118
Okay, just so we're clear,
there's no gay part?

19:21.284 --> 19:22.411
Just one.

19:24.704 --> 19:25.498
What?

19:26.047 --> 19:27.791
- Oh.
- Whoa!

19:27.958 --> 19:29.259
Oh, I thought they were gonna kiss.

19:29.384 --> 19:30.727
Oh yeah.

19:30.852 --> 19:31.819
- Sure.
- Yeah.

19:32.954 --> 19:34.598
So you guys are sure

19:34.723 --> 19:35.966
we got all the photos out
of that house of me, right?

19:36.091 --> 19:37.367
Oh, yeah.
There's nothing in there

19:37.492 --> 19:38.636
- they can trace back to you.
- All right.

19:38.802 --> 19:39.887
Dig in, boys!
First batch!

19:40.053 --> 19:41.271
Woo-hoo!

19:41.396 --> 19:42.730
- Here we go.
- Oh, you get the big dog.

19:43.056 --> 19:43.656
Here you go.

19:43.781 --> 19:44.876
Guess there were supposed
to be more strips,

19:45.001 --> 19:46.600
but chunks will do, I suppose.

19:46.725 --> 19:49.105
Well, that's our thing.
We have a chunkier jerk.

19:49.271 --> 19:50.356
- Yeah, cheers.
- Cheers.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.191
- Meat jerking beef boys.
- Mmm.

19:52.357 --> 19:54.610
Mmm.

19:54.776 --> 19:56.920
Mmm.

19:57.045 --> 19:58.239
Yum.

19:58.405 --> 19:59.990
I've never had wet jerky before.

20:00.115 --> 20:01.742
- I will say that.
- Different.

20:01.908 --> 20:02.859
- Some say wetter, the better.
- Mm-hmm.

20:02.984 --> 20:04.286
Most...
Most don't.

20:04.452 --> 20:05.704
This tastes like bacon...

20:05.870 --> 20:07.931
Like if bacon were marinated in rain

20:08.056 --> 20:09.917
for a few days in, like, a gutter.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.302
What did you do
to actually make this...

20:12.427 --> 20:13.712
Actually jerky?

20:13.878 --> 20:15.296
Well, we hung it and wiped it.

20:15.421 --> 20:16.298
That's what we did.

20:16.464 --> 20:19.218
- And I pissed on it.
- Adam pissed on it, now I remember.

20:19.384 --> 20:20.376
- Yeah.
- Yep.

20:20.501 --> 20:23.060
Why don't we just go for a spin
in my new Vo

20:23.185 --> 20:24.155
before I return it, man?

20:24.280 --> 20:26.100
Thank God for
that 24h buyer's remorse.

20:28.229 --> 20:29.630
Wait, what new Vo?

20:30.191 --> 20:32.303
Dude, my dad made me
go buy a drop-top like Vo

20:32.428 --> 20:33.621
that is parked outside
the other house.

20:33.746 --> 20:35.534
It's quite swift looking.

20:35.659 --> 20:38.154
That's not a stage car
to go along with a stage class?

20:39.108 --> 20:41.323
- No, they don't make stage cars.
- Why?

20:42.089 --> 20:43.510
- What'd you do?
- Maybe we should go inside.

20:43.635 --> 20:45.566
- What would you do?
- We quit it.

20:46.964 --> 20:48.084
And destroy it.

20:49.279 --> 20:50.147
Just kidding.

20:52.788 --> 20:54.879
I wouldn't do that to you.
