01:23.843 --> 01:24.719
Max!

01:24.844 --> 01:25.720
Uh-huh?

01:25.845 --> 01:27.597
Ready to concede?

01:27.680 --> 01:30.016
No!

01:43.863 --> 01:46.074
I thought as it's
your last night here,

01:46.199 --> 01:50.161
it only appropriate that we
open something extra special.

01:50.286 --> 01:51.329
Bandol.

01:51.412 --> 01:52.705
Excellent choice.

01:52.830 --> 01:57.460
Tempier Bandol, 1969.

01:57.543 --> 02:01.089
The kind of wine that'll pickle
even the toughest of men.

02:01.214 --> 02:05.260
I once saw a Castilian prizefighter

02:05.385 --> 02:06.719
collapse in a heap

02:06.844 --> 02:09.806
after drinking just a single glass.

02:09.889 --> 02:12.559
Perhaps my knee landing
squarely in his testicles...

02:14.227 --> 02:16.854
...may have been partly to blame.

02:16.980 --> 02:18.273
What was I talking about before?

02:18.398 --> 02:20.191
You said the importance
of a good blue suit

02:20.275 --> 02:21.484
can never be overstated.

02:21.568 --> 02:23.111
Quite right.

02:23.236 --> 02:25.989
A blue suit is the most
versatile of accoutrements.

02:26.072 --> 02:27.907
More important
than the suit itself

02:27.991 --> 02:29.701
is the man who fits it for you.

02:29.826 --> 02:31.536
Once you find a good tailor,

02:31.661 --> 02:33.621
you must never
give his name away,

02:33.746 --> 02:35.957
not even under the threat

02:36.082 --> 02:37.458
of bodily harm.

02:40.169 --> 02:43.298
(music continues in background)

02:43.423 --> 02:45.174
Now, where were we?

02:45.258 --> 02:47.093
- Whose turn is it?
- Mine.

02:47.176 --> 02:48.970
Uh-huh.

02:52.015 --> 02:53.933
Uh-huh.

02:54.058 --> 02:56.227
Max, have I told you why I enjoy

02:56.352 --> 02:58.021
- making wine so much?
- You don't

02:58.104 --> 03:00.440
make the wine, Uncle Henry,
that guy Duflot does.

03:00.565 --> 03:02.775
In France,
it's always the landowner

03:02.901 --> 03:04.903
who makes the wine.

03:05.028 --> 03:07.488
Even though he does
nothing more than supervise

03:07.614 --> 03:10.658
with binoculars
from the comfort of his study.

03:10.783 --> 03:14.621
No, I enjoy making wine
because this sublime nectar

03:14.704 --> 03:17.999
is quite simply incapable of lying.

03:18.124 --> 03:20.460
Picked too early,
picked too late, it matters not.

03:20.585 --> 03:23.463
The wine will always whisper
into your mouth

03:23.588 --> 03:25.632
with complete,
unabashed honesty,

03:25.757 --> 03:28.927
every time you take a sip.

03:30.803 --> 03:32.347
Mmm,

03:32.472 --> 03:33.932
delightful.

03:34.057 --> 03:35.975
Now, Maximillian,

03:36.100 --> 03:38.519
now you know why
I love wine so much,

03:38.645 --> 03:41.189
have you anything
you want to tell me?

03:41.314 --> 03:42.315
Yes, I do.

03:42.440 --> 03:43.983
Yes, what is it?

03:49.113 --> 03:50.490
Checkmate.

03:50.573 --> 03:53.284
You little shit.

04:08.675 --> 04:11.719
- Good morning, lab rats.
-  Good morning, Max.

04:11.844 --> 04:13.471
Today we're shifting gear.

04:13.596 --> 04:16.140
Today... is Greedy Bastard Day.

04:18.851 --> 04:20.853
The secret to riches, lab rats,

04:20.937 --> 04:25.066
is the same as the secret to comedy...

04:25.191 --> 04:26.651
timing.

04:26.859 --> 04:29.279
- 115.10, Max.

04:29.362 --> 04:31.447
So I thought we should move now.

04:31.531 --> 04:33.533
- Not yet, Alf.
- Boss,

04:33.616 --> 04:34.784
why do you keep calling me Alf?

04:34.867 --> 04:36.786
Because you're an aggressive
little flunky, Kenny.

04:36.869 --> 04:37.870
And as your boss

04:37.996 --> 04:39.455
and genetic superior,

04:39.539 --> 04:41.457
I can call you whatever I want.

04:42.709 --> 04:43.668
Max Skinner's phone.

04:43.793 --> 04:45.211
It's Kimberly.
Is Max there?

04:45.336 --> 04:46.713
Yeah. One moment, please.

04:46.838 --> 04:48.464
It's Kimberly.

04:51.175 --> 04:53.803
- Sorry, Kimberly, Max isn't here.
- Where is he?

04:53.887 --> 04:55.013
He and his fiancée

04:55.096 --> 04:56.764
are at their wedding
rehearsal today.

04:56.890 --> 04:58.516
- Their what?
- Do you want me to leave him a message?

04:58.641 --> 05:00.226
No, I don't want
to leave him a message!

05:00.351 --> 05:01.519
Okay.

05:02.687 --> 05:04.314
115.90...

05:04.397 --> 05:07.567
116...

05:07.692 --> 05:08.735
116.10.

05:08.860 --> 05:10.153
All right, lab rats,
just remember

05:10.236 --> 05:11.654
we're not here for the dental plan.

05:11.738 --> 05:14.782
50 big!
People are buying! Max?

05:14.908 --> 05:16.326
Sell.

05:20.997 --> 05:22.540
That's yours!

05:25.418 --> 05:26.669
I said that's yours!

05:33.259 --> 05:34.969
That miserable sod Skinner's
dumping bonds

05:35.094 --> 05:36.971
- onto the market.
- But he can't do that.

05:37.096 --> 05:38.431
There's a gentleman's agreement
on the exchange.

05:38.556 --> 05:40.350
A gentleman's agreement presupposes

05:40.433 --> 05:42.435
- there's a gentleman involved.
- Amis,

05:42.518 --> 05:44.771
he put out $5 billion
in sell orders- prices are

05:44.854 --> 05:46.272
- crashing through the floor!
- Come on,

05:46.356 --> 05:47.357
people, get off your asses!

05:47.440 --> 05:50.068
Come on, step to it!
Start selling!

05:50.151 --> 05:51.736
- Sell!

05:54.781 --> 05:56.574
They should bury you
face down, Max,

05:56.658 --> 05:59.202
because that's the way you're going.

06:04.457 --> 06:09.128
Free big figures to 113.50!

06:09.254 --> 06:10.880
Sell! Sell!

06:10.964 --> 06:12.465
Still going down.

06:12.590 --> 06:13.883
Buy.

06:13.967 --> 06:15.468
Fuckin' buy it all back!

06:15.552 --> 06:17.303
Buy it all back immediately!

06:17.428 --> 06:18.805
Buy it all back!
It's yours to buy back!

06:18.888 --> 06:20.848
Don't worry about it!
Buy it all back!

06:20.974 --> 06:22.350
You're a genius, Max!

06:25.311 --> 06:26.813
Filthy bugger,
he's forced down prices.

06:26.896 --> 06:28.940
He's gonna buy everything back
on the cheap!

06:29.065 --> 06:30.692
Start buying!

06:30.817 --> 06:32.151
Buying now! Start buying!

06:44.247 --> 06:46.082
- I can!
- I can!

06:46.165 --> 06:48.376
Well done today, lab rats.

06:48.501 --> 06:49.502
Wonderful work.

06:49.627 --> 06:52.046
We all made
a spectacular amount of money.

06:53.256 --> 06:55.258
Today we proved the adage that

06:55.341 --> 06:57.260
winning isn't everything...

06:57.343 --> 06:59.345
It's the only thing!

07:09.981 --> 07:11.733
And there were strange goings-on

07:11.858 --> 07:12.942
on the bond market today.

07:13.026 --> 07:17.530
Prices crashed to 112.5,
after Lorden Brothers

07:17.655 --> 07:20.283
unloaded $3 billion in sell orders.

07:20.366 --> 07:23.703
Then in an extraordinary
move, the company bought the bonds back

07:23.786 --> 07:25.413
at a substantially
reduced price,

07:25.538 --> 07:27.874
making over $77 million

07:27.999 --> 07:30.627
- in the process.
- Blimey.

07:30.710 --> 07:32.086
Cries of foul play were loud

07:32.211 --> 07:36.049
and widespread, with talks
of an inquiry to follow.

07:37.217 --> 07:38.384
Morning, Mr. Skinner.

07:38.509 --> 07:40.720
- Morning, Bert.
- And congratulations.

07:40.845 --> 07:42.597
- Thank you.
- You might've tipped me off,

07:42.722 --> 07:43.848
Mr. Skinner.

07:43.973 --> 07:45.892
I'll give you a tip, Bert:

07:45.975 --> 07:48.895
Never pat a burning dog.

07:50.063 --> 07:51.481
Wanker.

08:39.404 --> 08:42.073
Oh, Henry, bloody hell.

08:43.323 --> 08:45.910
<i>Ready for the fan mail?</i>

08:46.035 --> 08:47.870
Shoot, sunshine.

08:47.954 --> 08:49.455
- "Bastard."
- Uh-huh.

08:49.539 --> 08:50.331
"Bastard."

08:50.456 --> 08:51.082
Uh-huh.

08:51.207 --> 08:52.333
- "Burn in hell."
- Right.

08:52.458 --> 08:53.585
"Rot in hell."

08:53.710 --> 08:54.544
Oh. Lovely.

08:54.627 --> 08:55.503
"Die."

08:55.628 --> 08:56.170
Charming.

08:56.296 --> 08:57.297
Maxie?

08:57.422 --> 08:59.090
"Congratulations, you're my hero."

08:59.215 --> 09:00.633
Who said that?

09:00.717 --> 09:01.467
Your lawyer.

09:01.593 --> 09:02.510
- Oh.
- Maxie, listen,

09:02.635 --> 09:05.597
I just got off the phone
with, uh, Auzet.

09:05.722 --> 09:08.516
That's the notaire handling
your Uncle Henry's estate.

09:08.641 --> 09:09.809
She the one that sent me the letter?

09:09.934 --> 09:11.978
Yeah.

09:12.103 --> 09:15.481
Anyway, listen,
uh, it seems that

09:15.607 --> 09:16.691
your Uncle Henry

09:16.816 --> 09:18.192
hasn't updated his will

09:18.318 --> 09:19.527
in over 20 years.

09:19.652 --> 09:21.446
Which is why,
in typical frog fashion,

09:21.529 --> 09:22.739
they take over a month

09:22.822 --> 09:23.740
to notify us.

09:23.823 --> 09:25.408
All right, so what do we do with that?

09:25.491 --> 09:26.576
Is there a reading of the will,

09:26.659 --> 09:27.660
or do we just download

09:27.785 --> 09:29.537
that sort of thing these days?
What happens?

09:29.662 --> 09:31.873
No, that's the point, Max.

09:31.998 --> 09:33.958
Sorry?

09:34.083 --> 09:35.501
There is no legal will.

09:35.627 --> 09:36.502
Really?

09:36.628 --> 09:37.879
You're his closest
blood relative,

09:38.004 --> 09:40.548
- so you get everything.
- What, his clothes

09:40.673 --> 09:42.008
and his Edmundo Ross LPs?

09:43.134 --> 09:44.677
The house, you git.

09:44.802 --> 09:46.387
You get to keep his house.

09:46.512 --> 09:47.597
What, the old farmhouse

09:47.680 --> 09:49.390
and the vineyards and
the grapes and everything?

09:49.515 --> 09:53.186
Place like must be worth
a few quid these days.

09:53.311 --> 09:54.812
Hey.

09:54.938 --> 09:56.064
- Hmm.
- Anyway,

09:56.189 --> 09:58.524
I've booked you a flight

09:58.608 --> 10:01.778
and an appointment with Auzet
for 3:00 tomorrow afternoon.

10:01.861 --> 10:03.529
Just a few papers to sign.

10:03.655 --> 10:05.031
Come on, I can't go
to France tomorrow.

10:05.114 --> 10:06.449
Gem, I'm the toast of the town.

10:06.532 --> 10:07.867
I need to do
a few victory laps

10:07.992 --> 10:09.661
around the city,
show off a little bit,

10:09.786 --> 10:11.287
have a late night or two.
Oh, come on,

10:11.371 --> 10:12.914
you heard the mail-
it's times like this,

10:13.039 --> 10:14.707
when everyone hates you,
that's when it's fun.

10:14.832 --> 10:16.000
Go on, Max-
we'll take good care

10:16.125 --> 10:17.168
of the place when you're gone.

10:17.293 --> 10:18.503
No problems.

10:18.628 --> 10:19.671
Right.

10:19.796 --> 10:21.422
- Ken.
- Mm.

10:21.548 --> 10:22.924
Why don't you go
and try and find

10:23.049 --> 10:24.217
some small animals to hurt?

10:24.342 --> 10:27.887
I know, find a poodle and
punt it off the balcony.

10:35.520 --> 10:36.479
Hmm?

10:36.563 --> 10:38.064
- Tell me something, Max.
- Yes?

10:38.189 --> 10:40.066
Did you care for him?

10:41.192 --> 10:42.569
Yes, I did.

10:43.820 --> 10:45.989
When was the last time you spoke?

10:46.072 --> 10:47.198
A long time ago.

10:47.323 --> 10:48.324
Why?

10:48.408 --> 10:49.534
Well, I don't know, Gemma.

10:49.617 --> 10:51.077
That's probably got
something to do

10:51.160 --> 10:52.579
with me becoming an asshole.

10:55.081 --> 10:56.416
Okay.

11:14.767 --> 11:16.019
Max!

11:16.102 --> 11:17.854
- Hello, how are you?
- How are you?

11:17.937 --> 11:20.106
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

11:20.231 --> 11:22.692
I'm looking so much forward
to gloating through the room.

11:22.775 --> 11:25.612
Oh, well, follow me.

11:28.698 --> 11:30.992
- Danny, how are you?
- Congratulations.

11:31.117 --> 11:32.785
- Thank you. Austin.
- Max, congratulations.

11:32.911 --> 11:33.995
Say hello to your dad for me.

11:34.120 --> 11:35.955
Oh, love, mm.
How are you doing?

11:36.039 --> 11:37.665
- Very well. How are you?
- Oh, Lucy.

11:37.790 --> 11:40.084
- Hello.
- I didn't realize that you two knew each other.

11:40.168 --> 11:41.127
Whoops.

11:41.210 --> 11:43.504
He's adorable.

11:46.633 --> 11:48.885
Mm, magnificent bouquet.

11:48.968 --> 11:50.303
Alluring nose.

11:50.386 --> 11:51.429
Honey and spice.

11:51.554 --> 11:53.389
And all things nice.

11:53.473 --> 11:55.808
Inspection of the polyphenolics
reveals magnificent hues

11:55.892 --> 11:58.311
of brick red,
indicative of a mature Bordeaux.

11:58.436 --> 12:00.813
It's a burgundy.

12:02.398 --> 12:03.483
Yes, I knew it's burgundy.

12:03.608 --> 12:04.692
One for you, sir?

12:04.817 --> 12:08.154
I think I shall have an eclipse.

12:08.238 --> 12:09.530
- Thank you.
- Charles, can we get

12:09.656 --> 12:11.491
our minds off the double
frontage with the view

12:11.616 --> 12:12.867
and onto the French real estate?

12:12.992 --> 12:14.077
What do you think it's worth?

12:14.160 --> 12:16.079
Max, barely a day has passed
since you learned

12:16.162 --> 12:17.330
of the long-lost uncle's

12:17.455 --> 12:19.457
departure from this world,

12:19.582 --> 12:21.292
and all you can think of is money.

12:21.417 --> 12:23.044
The very same uncle you're
talking about, Charles, is

12:23.169 --> 12:25.004
the man who taught me every man
needs a fuck-you million.

12:25.088 --> 12:27.674
Okay, when are you gonna
furnish me with the particulars,

12:27.799 --> 12:29.092
because an estate agent
needs something

12:29.175 --> 12:30.176
he can sink his teeth into.

12:30.301 --> 12:32.845
Well, uh, it's been a while

12:32.971 --> 12:34.973
since I've been there,
but from memory,

12:35.098 --> 12:37.725
at least half a dozen
bedrooms, a pool, tennis...

12:37.850 --> 12:39.269
court, a decent-sized kitchen...

12:39.352 --> 12:42.355
- Thanks.
- 11 hectares, a vineyard.

12:42.438 --> 12:45.149
Bloody hell, Max, it sounds
like an estate to me, a château.

12:45.275 --> 12:47.527
What's a château go for these days?

12:47.652 --> 12:50.280
Well, we're obviously in the
"F-You" department, aren't we?

12:50.363 --> 12:51.739
- Maybe several.
- Really?

12:51.864 --> 12:53.700
God bless Henry.

12:53.783 --> 12:54.826
I won't count my commission.

12:54.909 --> 12:56.160
I wouldn't expect you to, Charles.

12:56.286 --> 12:57.912
That's why I'm fond of you.

12:58.037 --> 12:59.956
Well, in that case, Max...

13:00.039 --> 13:02.750
here's to you.

13:33.406 --> 13:35.533
Gemma.

13:42.749 --> 13:44.626
<i>Parlez-vous anglais?</i>

13:58.389 --> 13:59.933
- Yeah?
- Kenny,

14:00.058 --> 14:01.726
I want the current
ten-year yield,

14:01.851 --> 14:04.479
I want an update on the figures
for nonfarm payrolls,

14:04.604 --> 14:06.689
and I want you to get
your scrawny little backside

14:06.773 --> 14:07.941
out of my chair.

14:08.066 --> 14:10.568
Thank you.

14:11.527 --> 14:13.947
How'd he know that?

14:18.868 --> 14:20.995
Lance Armstrong!

14:38.388 --> 14:41.099
Maxie! Hi. How are you?

14:41.224 --> 14:42.642
Gemma, come on, love,
admit it: This is

14:42.767 --> 14:44.852
because I didn't shag you
at the Christmas party,

14:44.978 --> 14:46.604
- isn't it?
- Listen, I swear on my life,

14:46.729 --> 14:48.982
Max, they didn't have
any other cars.

14:50.316 --> 14:52.235
So, where are we, Max?

14:52.318 --> 14:54.862
Oh, for bollocky's sake!

14:54.988 --> 14:56.990
Right, I've gone
to the end of that road...

14:57.115 --> 14:59.200
- Look, they're both the D-3.
- (GPS repeats "Go!" in French)

14:59.325 --> 15:01.786
I've got Menerbes on my left,
or I've got Cavaillon on my right,

15:01.911 --> 15:03.746
and they're both on the D-3.

15:03.830 --> 15:05.623
-  Go! Go!
- Oh... shut up!

15:05.748 --> 15:08.167
Okay, okay, hang on a minute.
I'll help you. Hang on.

15:08.293 --> 15:09.586
I've got a...
I've got a GPS here

15:09.669 --> 15:11.671
-  Go! Go!
- With a stutter and a...

15:11.754 --> 15:13.798
quite frankly,
a shitty, froggy attitude!

15:15.341 --> 15:17.552
Okay, listen, you turn left
and that'll take you straight

15:17.677 --> 15:20.638
onto the N-7, and if you
really put your foot on it,

15:20.763 --> 15:23.850
you might even get
to your appointment on time.

15:26.936 --> 15:30.064
- Bollocks! Bugger!

15:32.275 --> 15:33.735
Mission control.

15:33.860 --> 15:35.653
All right, love,
please reschedule

15:35.737 --> 15:37.238
my meeting with the notaire

15:37.363 --> 15:38.615
for first thing tomorrow morning.

15:38.698 --> 15:39.616
Okay.

15:39.699 --> 15:41.367
What about the keys, Max?

15:41.492 --> 15:43.703
- Oh, there used to be a stone, you know.
- Uh-huh.

15:43.828 --> 15:46.998
Uh, by the front door. Ask her to put that...
put the keys under the stone,

15:47.123 --> 15:49.042
and I'll, um,
I'll pick them up from there.

15:49.167 --> 15:51.211
Okay, copy that. Copy that.

16:12.565 --> 16:14.567
Huh.

17:08.954 --> 17:11.915
Hello?

17:13.376 --> 17:16.880
Henry?

19:03.653 --> 19:06.322
<i>UNCLE HENRY'S VOICE:
Come on, you're slower than your Aunt Midge!</i>

19:07.907 --> 19:10.743
<i>- That's it, Maximillian.
- (Max grunting)</i>

19:10.868 --> 19:12.912
- It's not funny.

19:13.037 --> 19:15.290
What are you, a man or a mouse?

19:15.415 --> 19:17.750
Fine, then, I'm a mouse. Squeak, squeak!

19:32.724 --> 19:34.893
Hopeless, you're hopeless.

19:34.976 --> 19:36.436
Oh, stop it!

19:48.865 --> 19:51.701
Match point.

19:51.784 --> 19:53.119
Ace!

19:53.244 --> 19:54.787
Game! Set!

19:54.913 --> 19:57.165
- Match!
- You cannot be serious!

19:57.290 --> 19:58.541
- Hey.

19:58.625 --> 20:01.044
- You have to rub it in?
- Hey...

20:01.127 --> 20:03.129
The point is, Max, why
you aren't celebrating?

20:03.254 --> 20:04.714
Because I lost!

20:04.797 --> 20:06.716
Well, a man
should acknowledge

20:06.799 --> 20:12.305
his losses just as gracefully
as he celebrates his victories.

20:12.430 --> 20:14.057
Come on, give us a jig.

20:14.140 --> 20:15.725
Give your old uncle a jig.

20:15.808 --> 20:16.935
- Oh, yeah, I lost.
- Arms and up and down.

20:17.018 --> 20:20.021
Yeah, great, yeah, I lost! I lost!

20:20.146 --> 20:21.272
- Uncle Henry won!
- Yes.

20:21.397 --> 20:23.358
- Three cheers!
- Dance, don't shimmy like an Italian.

20:23.483 --> 20:24.567
Well done, Uncle Henry.

20:24.651 --> 20:26.486
This is stupid.

20:26.611 --> 20:29.239
You'll come to see

20:29.322 --> 20:32.033
that a man learns
nothing from winning.

20:32.158 --> 20:35.495
The act of losing, however,
can elicit great wisdom.

20:35.620 --> 20:37.372
Not least of which is, uh,

20:37.497 --> 20:40.166
how much more enjoyable it is to win.

20:40.291 --> 20:43.336
It's inevitable to lose now and again.

20:43.461 --> 20:46.798
The trick is not
to make a habit of it.

20:46.881 --> 20:48.007
Drink?

21:09.362 --> 21:10.780
Chicken shit.

21:10.863 --> 21:12.407
- Excuse me?

21:12.532 --> 21:14.576
On the roses.

21:14.701 --> 21:16.953
Oh, fertilizer.

21:17.036 --> 21:18.746
Oh, Tati.

21:18.871 --> 21:20.790
Hello.

21:20.873 --> 21:22.208
Duflot?

21:22.333 --> 21:23.585
<i>Oui.</i>

21:23.710 --> 21:24.878
- Max.
- My God.

21:25.003 --> 21:27.922
Haven't you... matured.

21:28.047 --> 21:30.842
<i>Ah, c'est vrai,
the floods of'78,</i>

21:30.925 --> 21:33.553
- Right.
- Mistral of'86,

21:33.678 --> 21:35.305
- fanleaf disease in '93.

21:35.388 --> 21:36.890
- Fanleaf disease.
- In each vintage I've

21:37.015 --> 21:40.351
corked away another
year of my youth.

21:40.435 --> 21:42.061
But I still have my wife, Ludivine.

21:42.186 --> 21:43.479
- Ludivine.
- Yeah.

21:43.563 --> 21:45.732
<i>And my dog...
ah, voila, Tati.</i>

21:47.275 --> 21:48.568
I expect you're hungry, no?

21:48.693 --> 21:49.694
Please, come tonight.

21:49.819 --> 21:51.237
My wife is roasting a lamb- mmm!

21:51.362 --> 21:52.572
To tell the truth,

21:52.697 --> 21:54.282
I haven't had much
of an appetite

21:54.407 --> 21:55.491
since I learned of Henry.

21:55.575 --> 21:58.661
Oh, the very last years,
his sight was failing.

21:58.745 --> 22:01.372
But I tended to things
for him, you know?

22:01.497 --> 22:03.833
We became very close.

22:03.917 --> 22:08.504
Almost like...
father and son.

22:08.588 --> 22:11.925
Well, I am most appreciative

22:12.050 --> 22:13.343
that someone was here for him.

22:13.426 --> 22:15.428
Well, my wife will
come in the morning

22:15.553 --> 22:16.721
with croissants, okay?

22:16.804 --> 22:18.890
Huh? She will resume her duties.

22:19.015 --> 22:21.601
<i>- Allez! Bon!
- If you insist.</i>

22:33.905 --> 22:35.907
Hmm.

22:37.617 --> 22:39.744
"Welcome."

22:41.454 --> 22:43.248
Ah.

22:43.331 --> 22:46.209
Don't mind if I do.

22:52.298 --> 22:54.050
Here's to you, Henry.

22:54.133 --> 22:57.762
Devoting your life to the vines...

22:57.887 --> 23:00.098
and bottling the truth.

23:05.436 --> 23:07.564
Hmm...

23:11.734 --> 23:13.570
That was honest.

23:13.653 --> 23:18.074
Jesus, ought to have
a poison sticker on it.

23:25.331 --> 23:27.667
Ah... coffee, coffee.

23:28.793 --> 23:30.587
What's in here?

23:30.670 --> 23:33.006
And that?

23:33.965 --> 23:35.592
Piss off.

23:40.179 --> 23:41.389
Hmm.

23:41.514 --> 23:44.100
Morning, Henry.

23:44.183 --> 23:47.020
Milk.

23:49.272 --> 23:51.107
Hmm.

23:58.323 --> 23:59.699
Maxie!

23:59.824 --> 24:00.742
Madame Duflot!

24:00.867 --> 24:02.702
Maxie! Maxie! Maxie!

24:07.165 --> 24:09.334
- Oh...
- Morning.

24:25.308 --> 24:26.726
Morning, Gemma.

24:26.809 --> 24:28.978
Are you enjoying yourself, Max?

24:29.062 --> 24:31.064
Oh, yes, as bereavements go, you know.

24:31.147 --> 24:32.565
This will cheer you up.

24:32.649 --> 24:33.942
You've been busted.

24:34.067 --> 24:36.903
<i>Morning Financial Times headline:</i>

24:36.986 --> 24:39.614
"Lorden Brothers trade
under investigation."

24:39.739 --> 24:42.033
You don't have to worry
about any of that.

24:42.116 --> 24:44.494
The FSA today launched
an official inquiry

24:44.577 --> 24:47.580
into recent Lorden Brothers
trade activity.

24:47.705 --> 24:49.582
Yes, well, I double-checked
it all through Legal.

24:49.707 --> 24:51.459
I covered our asses, okay?

24:51.584 --> 24:53.836
It's just bollocks to placate
the lucid back.

24:53.920 --> 24:55.463
Oh, he doesn't think so.

24:55.588 --> 24:59.467
- Nigel?
- Sir Nigel.

24:59.592 --> 25:02.720
He wants a meeting with you today,
5:00 this afternoon.

25:02.804 --> 25:05.098
Well, it must be
about something else.

25:05.223 --> 25:06.891
Um, what time is my meeting
with the notaire?

25:06.975 --> 25:08.851
A little over an hour from now.

25:08.935 --> 25:10.270
My time or yours?

25:10.353 --> 25:11.729
Oh, shit.

25:11.813 --> 25:13.565
Oh, Gemma!

25:42.635 --> 25:43.928
Yes?

25:44.012 --> 25:45.763
How's the house, Max?
Is it gorgeous?

25:45.847 --> 25:47.640
Well, to tell you
the truth, Charlie,

25:47.765 --> 25:48.892
it's a little bit shabby.

25:48.975 --> 25:50.059
We don't say shabby, Max.

25:50.143 --> 25:52.270
We say filled with the patina
of a bygone era.

25:52.353 --> 25:54.355
- How's the wine?
- Right.

25:54.480 --> 25:55.982
Uh, bouquet of a wet dog.

25:56.107 --> 25:57.942
Hits the palate
like a razor blade

25:58.026 --> 26:00.153
with a finish that hints of awful.

26:00.278 --> 26:01.529
So the house is falling apart

26:01.654 --> 26:02.947
and the vineyard
makes undrinkable wine?

26:03.031 --> 26:04.240
Excellent.

26:04.324 --> 26:06.576
One thing you are going
to need is an oenologue.

26:06.659 --> 26:07.827
All right, what's that?

26:07.952 --> 26:09.579
It's a sort of licensed wine expert.

26:09.662 --> 26:11.956
They take soil samples- bits of
the vine, that sort of thing-

26:12.081 --> 26:14.125
tests them- there must
be a couple near you.

26:14.250 --> 26:16.294
And also, I would need
a couple of sexy snaps

26:16.377 --> 26:17.712
to get the punters clamoring,

26:17.837 --> 26:20.924
and I have an e-mail address for
you to send them to, which is...

26:21.007 --> 26:23.426
Hold on a second.
I'll just put you on speaker.

26:23.509 --> 26:24.510
Okay, shoot.

26:24.594 --> 26:25.511
Provencelistings@

26:26.804 --> 26:29.641
abroadproperties. Inc.

26:29.724 --> 26:30.558
Shit.

26:30.683 --> 26:32.602
<i>- Hello?
- Attention!</i>

26:34.687 --> 26:36.189
- Hello?
- Shit.

26:38.107 --> 26:40.568
- Max?
- All right, go on.

27:07.303 --> 27:08.346
Auzet.

27:11.266 --> 27:12.684
Hello.

27:12.809 --> 27:14.602
Max Skinner.

27:14.686 --> 27:17.730
The vigneron makes the wine

27:17.814 --> 27:21.526
and the estate owner
maintains the property.

27:21.651 --> 27:22.527
Mr. Skinner?

27:22.652 --> 27:25.196
Yes, hmm, right, well, delightful.

27:25.321 --> 27:28.241
This is how your uncle
and Monsieur Duflot

27:28.324 --> 27:30.660
worked for over 20 years.

27:30.743 --> 27:31.953
Naturally, Monsieur Duflot

27:32.036 --> 27:34.330
will be anxious
as to your intentions.

27:34.414 --> 27:37.166
I think I can speed this up.

27:37.292 --> 27:40.461
I have no intention
of becoming a winemaker.

27:40.545 --> 27:44.883
So let Monsieur Duflot
make the wine

27:45.008 --> 27:47.176
and you enjoy the estate
on the weekends.

27:47.302 --> 27:49.137
I'm not sure you understand me.

27:49.220 --> 27:50.930
My life is in London.

27:51.014 --> 27:52.599
I don't do weekends.

27:52.682 --> 27:54.350
I intend to sell La Siroque

27:54.475 --> 27:55.852
as soon as possible.

27:55.935 --> 27:57.270
And what about, uh,

27:57.353 --> 27:59.188
Monsieur and Madame Duflot?

27:59.272 --> 28:01.024
Look, in all cases like this,
it simply

28:01.149 --> 28:02.358
just comes down to a figure.

28:02.483 --> 28:05.236
Well, if there's nothing else,
I have a plane to catch.

28:05.361 --> 28:07.530
Right.

28:23.880 --> 28:26.382
You're selling La Siroque?

28:26.466 --> 28:28.259
There has been a mistake, I think.

28:28.384 --> 28:29.761
News travels fast.

28:31.221 --> 28:32.639
But your uncle,

28:32.722 --> 28:34.599
he meant for you to have it,

28:34.724 --> 28:35.600
not sell it.

28:35.725 --> 28:36.893
Well, I'm sure if he did,

28:37.018 --> 28:38.895
he would have written
that down in a proper will.

28:39.020 --> 28:40.230
He didn't.

28:40.313 --> 28:42.690
You know, Henry was not
English the way you are.

28:42.774 --> 28:45.235
He was a man of secrets,
a man of passion.

28:45.360 --> 28:46.819
He didn't write things down.

28:46.903 --> 28:49.072
You would take me
away from my vines?

28:49.197 --> 28:51.574
My vines, Duflot.

28:51.699 --> 28:53.534
I live in them,

28:53.618 --> 28:54.786
I breathe in them.

28:54.911 --> 28:56.663
They tear my hands.

28:56.746 --> 28:59.249
Look, Francis, when
I sell the property,

28:59.332 --> 29:02.335
I do intend to make you
a handsome settlement.

29:02.418 --> 29:05.171
Do you know, monsieur,
what it is to love something

29:05.255 --> 29:07.674
more than your own life?

29:07.757 --> 29:10.885
To submit your days and nights
to the fickle will of nature?

29:11.010 --> 29:12.929
I have only a few vintages left.

29:13.054 --> 29:16.641
<i>Soon my body and spirit will
be defeated by the terroir.</i>

29:16.766 --> 29:18.851
And you would dare come
here and take away

29:18.935 --> 29:20.311
my last few chances of immortality?

29:20.436 --> 29:23.481
Afraid so. Be in touch.

29:32.824 --> 29:34.325
Leaving now.

29:34.450 --> 29:35.743
Oh, good.

29:35.827 --> 29:38.037
'Cause Sir Nigel has made
a special trip, Max.

29:38.121 --> 29:40.039
- Is everything okay?
- Everything's fine.

29:40.123 --> 29:42.709
Good. Oh, did you remember
to take photos for Charlie?

29:42.792 --> 29:43.877
Yes.

29:43.960 --> 29:45.670
- Damn it!

29:45.795 --> 29:47.672
Idiot.

30:40.099 --> 30:43.645
Let's see you then.

30:43.770 --> 30:44.854
One... two...

30:44.979 --> 30:46.564
...and go!

31:09.462 --> 31:11.297
- Yes?
- Get in the car.

31:11.381 --> 31:13.925
Get off my camera.

31:19.556 --> 31:21.391
- Bollocks!

31:40.910 --> 31:44.372
Oh, come on!
Where's the ladder?

31:44.497 --> 31:47.750
Where are you, tosser?

32:32.462 --> 32:34.297
- Hold on!

32:36.257 --> 32:38.635
Come to Papa. Come to Papa.

32:44.807 --> 32:49.437
Gemma, for God's sake, keep calling!

33:03.743 --> 33:05.787
Hello.

33:05.870 --> 33:07.914
Oh, no, don't worry about me.

33:07.997 --> 33:09.415
I'm... I'm the pool man.

33:09.499 --> 33:11.459
I do this every Thursday.

33:11.543 --> 33:13.127
It's just routine maintenance.

33:15.505 --> 33:18.675
It's been lovely chatting to you.

33:23.930 --> 33:27.642
And, and you are
a spectacular vision.

33:29.060 --> 33:31.354
But any chance for a rope
or a ladder?

33:31.437 --> 33:34.607
Is that your little car?

33:34.691 --> 33:36.818
Uh, yes, I'm the temporary custodian

33:36.901 --> 33:38.778
of the lime green roller skate,

33:38.861 --> 33:40.446
but it's a hired car; it's a rental.

33:40.530 --> 33:41.322
It's not for sale. Sorry?

33:41.406 --> 33:42.740
- Can you swim?
- Well, yes, but...

33:42.865 --> 33:43.992
but not in a foot of cow shit.

33:48.997 --> 33:50.456
Hello?

33:58.798 --> 34:01.175
Will all passengers on Flight...

34:03.303 --> 34:06.806
He's not on the flight.

34:06.931 --> 34:08.433
Right, right.

34:08.516 --> 34:11.728
Okay, roger that.

34:37.295 --> 34:39.505
What is it, Major Lawrence,

34:39.589 --> 34:43.635
that attracts you, personally,
to the desert?

34:45.178 --> 34:46.429
It's clean.

34:46.512 --> 34:49.514
I like it because it's clean.

35:11.621 --> 35:13.414
Great.

35:30.640 --> 35:33.142
You better be in prison, Maxie.

35:33.226 --> 35:34.644
Yes, just tell him I'm sorry.

35:34.727 --> 35:36.437
There was nothing
I could do about it.

35:36.563 --> 35:38.731
Sorry's no good, Max.
He's gone.

35:38.856 --> 35:40.233
Oh, shit.

35:40.358 --> 35:43.653
Um, what time is the first
flight out in the morning?

35:43.736 --> 35:46.072
Oh, there's no point
in rushing back, Max.

35:46.197 --> 35:49.200
You know, the last thing
Sir Nigel did on his way out

35:49.325 --> 35:52.203
- was to suspend you for a week.
- What?

35:52.287 --> 35:54.998
What the f- does he expect me
to do for a week?

35:55.081 --> 35:56.583
Take a holiday?

35:56.708 --> 35:58.251
Christ, he didn't say that, did he?

35:58.376 --> 35:59.419
No, I just did.

35:59.544 --> 36:01.212
Right, Gemma. Never say that.

36:01.296 --> 36:02.547
If anybody calls,

36:02.630 --> 36:04.591
do not say I'm on holiday.

36:04.716 --> 36:06.134
All right?
That's worse than dying.

36:06.259 --> 36:07.552
Now, look.

36:07.635 --> 36:09.762
I'll be back in the office
in a couple of days.

36:09.888 --> 36:10.889
- You just make sure
- Okay.

36:10.972 --> 36:12.974
That every man jack
in there is ready.

36:13.099 --> 36:15.101
Set it up so I can
trade in Kenny's name.

36:15.226 --> 36:16.227
What?

36:16.352 --> 36:18.396
Get him a clearance
at the highest level

36:18.479 --> 36:20.064
on Sir Nigel's recommend.

36:20.189 --> 36:21.149
Are you mad, Max?

36:21.274 --> 36:22.317
Who cares? Just do it.

36:22.442 --> 36:23.443
Don't tell anybody, all right?

36:23.568 --> 36:25.945
Especially not that
little shit, Kenny.

36:26.070 --> 36:27.780
Max, is there a problem?

36:27.906 --> 36:29.782
No, I'm having a great time.

36:29.908 --> 36:30.950
- You sure?
- Yes.

36:31.075 --> 36:33.203
- You just be careful, okay? Okay. Ciao.
- Okay.

36:33.286 --> 36:35.205
Bye.

37:32.428 --> 37:34.055
- Oh, shit!

37:34.138 --> 37:37.100
Shit! Scorpion! Scorpion!
Ludivine!

37:38.643 --> 37:39.727
Scorpion!

37:39.852 --> 37:42.647
- Oh! Drop it! Bloody hell!

37:42.730 --> 37:45.024
Get that little bastard!

37:47.402 --> 37:48.945
Of course.

37:49.070 --> 37:50.321
Okay.

38:13.303 --> 38:14.929
Fits very well; beautifully.

38:15.054 --> 38:16.598
Max?

38:16.723 --> 38:18.433
Are you back in Blighty?

38:18.516 --> 38:19.809
On the contrary, chuckles.

38:19.934 --> 38:23.479
I've decided to stick around
for a couple of days.

38:23.605 --> 38:25.565
So it's true,
you are getting the sack.

38:25.648 --> 38:27.483
No, I'm not getting
the sack, Charlie.

38:27.609 --> 38:30.320
I'm just exploring my options,
with a view to realizing

38:30.445 --> 38:32.405
the full potential
of my inheritance.

38:32.488 --> 38:33.740
Well, speaking
of your inheritance,

38:33.823 --> 38:35.158
how soon before we can view?

38:35.283 --> 38:36.618
It's cosmetic stuff mostly, I'd say.

38:36.701 --> 38:39.746
Surprising, actually,
how well it's been maintained.

38:39.871 --> 38:41.122
Hmm. So you don't need

38:41.206 --> 38:42.665
a contractor or anything like that?

38:42.790 --> 38:44.751
Uh, no, no, no, no.
Just needs a...

38:44.834 --> 38:47.462
a coat of paint
and a bit of a scrub.

38:47.587 --> 38:48.671
Okay, you sure?

38:48.796 --> 38:51.633
- No problem at all, Charlie.
- Good.

38:51.716 --> 38:54.177
Charlie?

38:54.302 --> 38:56.846
Charlie, can you hear me?

38:56.971 --> 38:58.014
- Yes.

38:58.139 --> 38:59.098
Can you hear me now?

38:59.224 --> 39:01.643
- Yes.
- Look, I wasn't joking before

39:01.726 --> 39:03.853
about what I said
about the wine they make here.

39:03.978 --> 39:08.107
It is not, I repeat,
not first-class.

39:08.191 --> 39:10.985
- Will that affect our price?
- Well, how bad can it be?

39:11.110 --> 39:12.820
Uh, well,
it gives you a blinding headache

39:12.904 --> 39:14.155
- and it makes you angry.
- Ah.

39:14.280 --> 39:16.991
I can't imagine the damage
a second sip might do.

39:17.075 --> 39:18.826
Well, we'll just have
to make sure

39:18.910 --> 39:20.662
our buyers don't know
anything about wine.

39:20.745 --> 39:22.080
We'll concentrate on the Americans.

39:23.831 --> 39:26.334
Just make sure she's match-fit
in 72 hours.

39:26.459 --> 39:27.919
72 hours.

39:28.002 --> 39:29.337
Righto.

39:32.757 --> 39:34.175
A Lamborghini tractor.

39:34.300 --> 39:35.510
<i>Paintbrush...</i>

39:35.593 --> 39:36.844
paintbrush, paintbrush.

39:40.807 --> 39:42.767
Paintbrush!

39:57.115 --> 39:58.116
You old bugger.

40:27.770 --> 40:29.939
Duflot.

40:32.025 --> 40:35.445
I was just about to use
that paintbrush.

40:35.570 --> 40:36.863
It's my paintbrush.

40:36.946 --> 40:38.239
Gee whiz.

40:38.364 --> 40:39.616
This is fun.

40:39.741 --> 40:41.534
Tell you what,

40:41.618 --> 40:44.245
I'll give you 20 euros
for your paintbrush.

40:44.370 --> 40:45.496
- Hmm?
- No.

40:45.622 --> 40:46.581
No?

40:46.706 --> 40:48.082
Fifty.

40:48.166 --> 40:50.710
I'll give you a hundred euros
for your paintbrush, Duflot.

40:50.835 --> 40:52.462
I don't care.
What do you want?

40:55.715 --> 40:57.592
When you sell, I stay vigneron.

40:57.675 --> 40:59.219
I keep my vines.

40:59.344 --> 41:00.386
You want to stay with your vines?

41:00.470 --> 41:01.721
- Mm-hmm.
- Fine.

41:01.804 --> 41:03.097
That means you...

41:03.181 --> 41:05.475
must help me...
fix the place up-

41:05.600 --> 41:06.851
do the gardens,

41:06.935 --> 41:09.437
paint the house,
clean the pool- and I,

41:09.520 --> 41:11.522
if at all possible,
will attempt to convince

41:11.648 --> 41:13.608
the new owners
of the worth and value

41:13.733 --> 41:15.109
of your services.

41:15.235 --> 41:16.444
<i>D'accord?</i>

41:17.987 --> 41:19.239
A Frenchman's hand

41:19.322 --> 41:21.574
is his word.

41:22.784 --> 41:25.453
An Englishman's word is his bond.

41:25.537 --> 41:27.622
<i>- Concord?
- Deal.</i>

41:28.498 --> 41:30.166
Frog tosspot.

41:30.291 --> 41:31.251
English prick.

41:50.436 --> 41:51.521
No.

42:28.433 --> 42:30.351
Awfully sorry.

42:32.312 --> 42:34.522
Goal of the day.

42:51.164 --> 42:53.917
Bat. Come on.

42:54.042 --> 42:55.543
Here comes the ball!

42:57.295 --> 42:58.755
Champion of the over- unh!

43:00.173 --> 43:02.759
Let's play.

43:02.884 --> 43:04.427
Come on.

43:06.638 --> 43:09.682
All right, I'm 12-none out.

43:11.935 --> 43:12.894
Okay.

43:19.150 --> 43:20.568
It won't last one month.

43:20.693 --> 43:22.946
If things go
according to plan, Francis,

43:23.071 --> 43:25.406
it will be somebody else's problem.

43:28.326 --> 43:30.370
Monsieur Max!

43:30.453 --> 43:31.538
Yes?

43:31.621 --> 43:35.583
There is, um... a person

43:35.667 --> 43:37.377
- at the door.
- A person?

43:37.502 --> 43:38.586
A person.

43:42.549 --> 43:44.217
<i>Bonjour.</i>

43:44.342 --> 43:45.510
<i>Bonjour.</i>

43:48.638 --> 43:51.391
The only country that issues
teeth like that is America.

43:51.516 --> 43:52.642
Oh.

43:52.767 --> 43:53.810
You speak English.

43:53.935 --> 43:55.353
- Like a native.

43:55.436 --> 43:57.105
I'm Christie Roberts.

43:57.230 --> 43:59.107
I'm looking for Mr. Skinner.

43:59.232 --> 44:01.734
You lucky devil, you found him.

44:01.859 --> 44:03.278
Impossible.

44:03.403 --> 44:05.405
You're way too young.

44:05.530 --> 44:08.825
You know, I was just thinking
the same thing about you.

44:08.950 --> 44:11.202
I meant too young to be my dad.

44:13.329 --> 44:15.874
Henry Skinner is my father.

44:18.084 --> 44:19.419
She has Henry's nose.

44:19.544 --> 44:20.545
<i>Allez. Allez.</i>

44:23.506 --> 44:25.258
Wow.

44:27.927 --> 44:29.762
This your mum?

44:29.888 --> 44:31.180
<i>In all her Flashdance glory.</i>

44:33.474 --> 44:35.768
So, uh...

44:35.894 --> 44:37.437
is he around?

44:39.480 --> 44:40.607
Oh, bollocks.

44:40.690 --> 44:41.774
Um...

44:45.069 --> 44:46.487
I'm sorry.
I've forgotten your name.

44:46.613 --> 44:48.489
- It's Christie.
- Christie.

44:48.615 --> 44:51.451
You see, Christie, um...

44:51.534 --> 44:53.578
Henry...

44:55.330 --> 44:57.373
He's dead, huh?

44:57.498 --> 44:59.292
A month ago.

45:02.879 --> 45:05.006
Um...

45:06.257 --> 45:07.800
Cup of tea?

45:07.884 --> 45:09.636
Yes?

45:09.719 --> 45:11.179
Madame Duflot.

45:12.889 --> 45:14.265
Well, no, it's more
than a wrinkle, Max.

45:14.349 --> 45:15.808
What if the girl
turns out to be legit?

45:15.892 --> 45:16.976
Oh, come on, she turns up

45:17.060 --> 45:18.811
a couple months after he parks it?

45:18.895 --> 45:20.563
Far too sweet, Charlie;
I'm not buying it.

45:20.688 --> 45:21.856
You need some
legal advice, mate,

45:21.981 --> 45:23.816
and you need it fast,
in case the little minx

45:23.900 --> 45:25.610
screws up the whole deal.

45:25.693 --> 45:26.986
Asking price?

45:27.111 --> 45:28.613
Uh, it's seven and a half.

45:28.696 --> 45:30.114
Did you get that?

45:30.198 --> 45:33.201
Right.

45:36.913 --> 45:39.874
Christie, I'm just going
to pop into town.

45:39.999 --> 45:42.043
Oh, no problem-
I booked a youth hostel,

45:42.168 --> 45:43.336
just in case the old man

45:43.461 --> 45:44.796
- was schizo, you know?
- Oh, right.

45:44.879 --> 45:46.839
Oh, you mind dropping me off?

45:46.923 --> 45:50.510
I really got to get
out of these clothes.

45:50.635 --> 45:52.595
Why don't you just get
out of your clothes here?

45:52.720 --> 45:54.931
Got plenty of space, lots of room.

45:55.056 --> 45:56.349
You can clean up, take a shower.

45:56.432 --> 45:58.434
- I'll be back in a jiff.
- You sure?

45:58.560 --> 46:00.520
Absolutely, absolutely.

46:00.603 --> 46:02.438
Madame Duflot?

46:02.564 --> 46:04.524
<i>Voila.</i>

46:07.735 --> 46:10.863
In the French law, there is no difference between

46:10.989 --> 46:13.783
legitimate and illegitimate
children when it comes

46:13.908 --> 46:16.202
to their right to inherit.

46:16.286 --> 46:17.662
That's bloody ridiculous.

46:17.745 --> 46:19.330
She never even met Henry.

46:19.414 --> 46:21.040
She could very well be an impostor.

46:21.124 --> 46:23.459
That is precisely why
she would be required

46:23.585 --> 46:24.878
to produce some form

46:24.961 --> 46:26.713
of documentation.

46:26.838 --> 46:28.172
Photo or even

46:28.256 --> 46:30.758
correspondence- a love letter.

46:30.884 --> 46:34.429
Yes, yes, yes, but what if I just...
sell the property

46:34.554 --> 46:37.223
before she even makes her claim?

46:37.307 --> 46:41.227
No; legally, she could
invalidate the sale

46:41.311 --> 46:43.062
even after the transfer of title.

46:43.187 --> 46:44.439
Bugger.

46:44.564 --> 46:46.107
My advice, Mr. Skinner,

46:46.232 --> 46:48.443
is to treat her
with the utmost respect.

46:48.568 --> 46:50.236
Goes without saying.

46:50.320 --> 46:52.780
And hope she'll be on her way.

46:52.906 --> 46:54.574
...bugger off.

46:54.699 --> 46:57.869
Don't let this... end in court.

47:17.013 --> 47:19.098
<i>Merci.</i>

47:31.611 --> 47:32.737
Joan of Arc?

47:33.821 --> 47:37.325
Oh, Jacques Cousteau.

47:37.450 --> 47:39.118
You tried to drown me.

47:39.202 --> 47:41.246
And you tried to run me
over with your little car.

47:41.329 --> 47:43.540
What are you talking about,
I tried to run you over?

47:43.665 --> 47:44.457
What sort of bollocks is that?

47:44.541 --> 47:46.084
Down the road
from La Siroque,

47:46.167 --> 47:48.294
you were driving your
midget car on your phone.

47:49.379 --> 47:51.089
<i>Bonjour. Bonjour.</i>

47:51.172 --> 47:52.507
And I believe

47:52.632 --> 47:54.592
had your head stuck
very far up your ass.

47:54.676 --> 47:57.345
Look at the damage
you have caused me!

47:57.470 --> 47:59.097
You tried to kill me,

47:59.180 --> 48:00.848
I tried to kill you.

48:05.478 --> 48:07.772
My God.

48:07.855 --> 48:09.941
She's fantastic.

48:15.071 --> 48:17.323
Hey, Max.

48:17.448 --> 48:18.992
Look at the view.

48:19.075 --> 48:20.201
It's like Cézanne.

48:37.969 --> 48:39.220
Oh, Tati. Psst.

48:44.392 --> 48:45.852
Francis...

48:45.935 --> 48:49.147
in, uh, in town today,

48:49.230 --> 48:51.733
I was, um,

48:51.816 --> 48:53.234
I was passing by this restaurant...

48:53.359 --> 48:55.028
Her name is Fanny Chenal.

48:56.613 --> 48:57.530
Right.

48:57.614 --> 48:58.698
Many times, I've seen

48:58.823 --> 49:01.534
this same look on your uncle's face.

49:01.618 --> 49:03.328
But you deserve credit.

49:03.411 --> 49:04.871
Why is that?

49:04.954 --> 49:07.207
You are now the town hero
for making her show

49:07.332 --> 49:08.875
her derriere.

49:13.254 --> 49:16.341
She, um...
She grew up around here, didn't she?

49:16.424 --> 49:17.717
Who?

49:17.842 --> 49:20.220
Fanny Chenal.

49:20.303 --> 49:22.388
I believe, yes.

49:22.513 --> 49:24.432
She, um...

49:26.476 --> 49:28.228
She otherwise spoken for?

49:28.353 --> 49:30.521
She was once.

49:30.605 --> 49:33.316
A football player- for Lyon.

49:33.441 --> 49:34.525
He was shit,

49:34.609 --> 49:36.152
just like his left foot.

49:36.277 --> 49:38.530
He treated her very badly, you know.

49:38.613 --> 49:41.407
Since then, it's rumored
that she will let no man

49:41.533 --> 49:43.076
near her heart.

49:54.087 --> 49:55.505
So she's alone, then.

49:56.798 --> 49:58.299
Who?

49:58.424 --> 50:00.051
Fanny Chenal.

50:00.134 --> 50:01.094
Max,

50:01.177 --> 50:02.929
recall what Proust said:

50:03.054 --> 50:04.556
"Leave pretty women

50:04.681 --> 50:06.307
to men without imagination."

50:06.474 --> 50:07.767
Duflot, I'm a banker.

50:09.269 --> 50:11.145
I have no imagination.

50:11.271 --> 50:13.064
Stop.

50:17.402 --> 50:18.903
Fred Perry.

50:20.989 --> 50:22.740
Henri Lacoste.

50:36.713 --> 50:37.672
Love-15.

50:42.844 --> 50:43.887
15-all.

50:47.515 --> 50:48.933
Yes!

50:51.811 --> 50:53.521
No, no, out.

50:53.646 --> 50:55.231
Cannot be serious!
That was in by a mile!

50:56.190 --> 50:57.942
Ball. Ball!

51:01.779 --> 51:02.447
Ah, good.

51:06.409 --> 51:07.577
- Yeah! Hey!

51:09.704 --> 51:10.997
Oh... oh, bollocks!

51:29.515 --> 51:30.808
My point.

51:43.420 --> 51:44.588
Match point.

51:54.890 --> 51:55.849
Game.

51:55.933 --> 51:57.059
Hmm.

52:17.579 --> 52:18.455
Eh, Tati.

52:50.821 --> 52:52.781
<i>Voila.</i>

52:57.995 --> 52:59.454
Oh, Maxie.

52:59.580 --> 53:01.873
Oh, look, Ludivine, um,

53:01.999 --> 53:03.041
she's my cousin.

53:03.166 --> 53:04.710
Well, she might be...
could end up turning out

53:04.835 --> 53:07.212
to be, um, a relative, uh,
from a cousinly perspect...

53:07.337 --> 53:08.589
Uh-huh.

53:08.672 --> 53:10.048
This is perhaps
a little over the top.

53:10.173 --> 53:11.049
No.

53:11.174 --> 53:12.801
Half the aristocrats in France

53:12.926 --> 53:15.304
have liaison with their cousins.

53:15.387 --> 53:16.388
Gosh, that explains a lot.

53:16.513 --> 53:18.307
- Ooh.

53:21.351 --> 53:23.145
Oh, won't do.

53:25.188 --> 53:26.982
Anything but, uh...
La Siroque.

53:27.107 --> 53:29.067
<i>Vin de merdre.</i>

53:31.904 --> 53:34.448
No label.
That looks promising.

53:36.909 --> 53:38.493
<i>HENRY: Careful on those steps.</i>

53:44.041 --> 53:45.667
What do you see up there?

53:45.751 --> 53:46.752
<i>Fervens.</i>

53:46.877 --> 53:49.796
Are you speaking in tongues, boy?

53:49.880 --> 53:52.007
"Fervere"- it's a Latin term.

53:52.132 --> 53:54.301
It means "to boil."

53:54.384 --> 53:57.971
The native yeasts in your cellar
are converting the sugar

53:58.055 --> 53:59.139
inside the grapes to alcohol.

54:00.390 --> 54:02.517
The release of
carbon dioxide gas

54:02.601 --> 54:04.937
is what causes the bubbling of it.

54:05.062 --> 54:06.438
I must be suffering from dementia.

54:06.563 --> 54:07.606
I don't recall ever
having told you that.

54:09.399 --> 54:10.484
You didn't.

54:10.567 --> 54:12.527
Monsieur Duflot explained it to me.

54:12.611 --> 54:14.863
Well done.

54:14.988 --> 54:16.156
Proves the adage

54:16.240 --> 54:18.742
that wisdom can be found
in the most unlikely places.

54:19.785 --> 54:22.329
To watch Duflot on bended knee

54:22.412 --> 54:25.207
doing something as simple
as weeding his soil,

54:25.332 --> 54:27.000
he brings a magnificent poetry

54:27.125 --> 54:29.044
in his devotion
to each and every grape.

54:30.712 --> 54:32.548
Perhaps it'd inspire you

54:32.631 --> 54:36.843
to find devotion in what you do
for a living one day.

54:36.927 --> 54:40.681
I want to be a professional
poker player when I'm older.

54:40.764 --> 54:41.932
Or a comedian.

54:42.057 --> 54:43.225
Maximillian,

54:43.350 --> 54:45.894
ask me what is

54:46.019 --> 54:48.814
the most important thing in comedy.

54:48.897 --> 54:51.608
What is the most
important thing

54:51.733 --> 54:52.776
- in comedy?
- Timing.

54:56.238 --> 54:57.281
Timing.

55:03.078 --> 55:04.955
Have you tasted Dad's wine?

55:05.080 --> 55:06.415
Oh, yes, indeed.
Bloody awful, isn't it?

55:06.498 --> 55:07.833
But I do recommend it

55:07.916 --> 55:10.419
for getting the paint out from
underneath your fingernails.

55:10.544 --> 55:11.920
So you know.

55:12.045 --> 55:14.256
Well, I'm more of a cognac drinker.

55:14.381 --> 55:15.966
I'm too impatient
to be a wine lover.

55:16.091 --> 55:17.175
If I'm gonna get drunk,
I don't want

55:17.259 --> 55:18.218
to spend all night doing it.

55:18.302 --> 55:19.219
Try that.

55:22.264 --> 55:23.140
It's better.

55:23.265 --> 55:25.893
It's extraordinary.

55:25.976 --> 55:27.936
Like a Bordeaux,

55:28.061 --> 55:29.229
only velvet rather than wool.

55:29.354 --> 55:30.355
Well, well,

55:30.439 --> 55:31.857
guess who knows a thing
or two about wine.

55:33.108 --> 55:34.026
Back in Napa,

55:34.109 --> 55:35.235
we're known to gargle

55:35.360 --> 55:37.070
and spit on occasion.

55:37.154 --> 55:39.197
That sounds like fun.

55:39.281 --> 55:42.743
Is, uh, is this made here

55:42.826 --> 55:44.077
on the estate?

55:44.161 --> 55:45.412
"Coin Perdu."

55:45.495 --> 55:46.914
Doubt it.

55:46.997 --> 55:48.540
Different bottles.

55:48.624 --> 55:50.083
Same corks.

55:50.167 --> 55:51.543
<i>Un petit mystery, n'est-ce pas?</i>

55:51.627 --> 55:54.046
Well, Henry always was
a little bit of a mystery.

55:54.129 --> 55:55.672
How so?

55:55.797 --> 55:59.259
He loved England,
but he lived in France.

55:59.384 --> 56:01.094
And he loved women,

56:01.178 --> 56:03.639
but never the same one
for more than

56:03.722 --> 56:06.225
a certain period of time.

56:06.308 --> 56:08.227
He never got married.

56:08.310 --> 56:09.686
And he loved adventure.

56:09.811 --> 56:10.729
But every single one of

56:10.812 --> 56:12.022
my memories takes place

56:12.147 --> 56:15.484
within about 100 steps
of this very spot.

56:15.567 --> 56:17.444
Are they good memories?

56:17.527 --> 56:20.280
No.

56:20.405 --> 56:22.616
They're grand.

56:24.326 --> 56:26.286
I'm going to go upstairs,

56:26.370 --> 56:28.747
finish my book.

56:28.830 --> 56:31.416
<i>Death in Venice.</i>

56:31.500 --> 56:32.542
That's my book.

56:32.668 --> 56:34.044
Don't tell me the ending.

56:41.426 --> 56:43.303
Well, actually, I never
got around to finishing it.

56:43.387 --> 56:45.681
Hello, old mate, how are you?

56:45.806 --> 56:47.057
Just a quick question.

56:47.182 --> 56:48.517
Yeah, hang on. Shirley.

56:51.228 --> 56:52.229
Yes?

56:52.354 --> 56:53.230
You'd know this.

56:53.355 --> 56:54.398
In France,

56:54.523 --> 56:57.150
is it actually illegal
to shag your own cousin?

56:57.276 --> 56:58.735
Only if she's ugly.

56:58.860 --> 57:00.195
Right.

57:05.450 --> 57:06.702
Bollocks.

57:08.745 --> 57:11.915
Lance Armstrong!

57:16.712 --> 57:17.963
I know, I'm so sorry.

57:18.046 --> 57:21.174
I'm supposed to be here
for a 7:30 reservation!

57:21.300 --> 57:23.176
30 minutes, I'm sorry.

57:23.260 --> 57:24.720
Oh, come on.

57:24.803 --> 57:26.013
I know. I know.

57:26.138 --> 57:28.181
You said we'd be seated right away.

57:28.307 --> 57:29.975
I know. Okay, you have a drink.

57:30.058 --> 57:32.352
We'll offer you a drink,

57:32.436 --> 57:34.688
and you'll have your table in
less than 20 minutes, okay?

57:34.771 --> 57:36.523
All righty. Okay.

57:36.607 --> 57:37.774
All right, what I want is-

57:37.900 --> 57:39.735
get ready, write it down:
Double mai tai.

57:43.739 --> 57:45.699
Caroline?

57:51.914 --> 57:53.248
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

57:53.332 --> 57:55.876
<i>Monsieur...</i>

57:55.959 --> 57:57.878
Well, I hope your
food's wonderful

57:57.961 --> 57:59.421
because your service
is obviously lousy.

57:59.504 --> 58:01.215
Please, Monsieur, I'm too busy
to ignore you.

58:01.298 --> 58:03.342
- Where are all your waiters, love?
- Look,

58:03.425 --> 58:05.093
<i>- my hands are full without fun
and games with you. Comprends?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

58:05.093 --> 58:05.969
<i>- My hands are full without fun
and games with you. Comprends?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

58:06.094 --> 58:09.348
McDonald's is in Avignon,
fish and chips in Marseille.

58:10.641 --> 58:11.892
Table six?

58:11.975 --> 58:13.560
Allez, allez!

58:17.272 --> 58:18.732
- What are you doing?
- Don't worry, love.

58:18.857 --> 58:19.691
Done this before.

58:19.775 --> 58:20.692
Where?

58:20.776 --> 58:21.860
Worked my way through university

58:21.944 --> 58:23.070
at London's finest restaurants.

58:25.113 --> 58:26.073
Monsieur!

58:26.156 --> 58:28.367
<i>- Mais qu'est-ce qui se passe?
- Alors?</i>

58:28.450 --> 58:30.410
<i>Venez, monsieur!</i>

58:30.494 --> 58:31.745
Okay, okay.
You can serve.

58:31.828 --> 58:34.248
But remember, if there
are any complaints,

58:34.331 --> 58:36.583
in France,
the customer is always wrong.

58:36.667 --> 58:38.418
Table six.

58:38.544 --> 58:39.878
Table six.

58:50.806 --> 58:52.808
<i>Bonsoir...</i>

58:52.891 --> 58:53.934
Table?

58:54.017 --> 58:57.437
Uh... 16.

59:03.318 --> 59:05.529
Champagne?

59:05.654 --> 59:07.990
Yes, cheers. And wha-what
are we going to have here?

59:08.073 --> 59:10.200
Garkin! Garkin! Get over here.

59:10.325 --> 59:11.577
<i>- I need, need help over here.
- En deux minutes, monsieur.</i>

59:11.660 --> 59:12.661
Where you going?

59:13.537 --> 59:14.621
Garkin!

59:14.746 --> 59:16.081
Oh, do you speak American?

59:16.164 --> 59:17.499
'Cause this menu
is all in French

59:17.624 --> 59:18.584
and we don't understand it.

59:18.667 --> 59:20.419
Yeah, we need some silverware.

59:20.502 --> 59:22.045
But, uh, let me tell you
what I would like to have.

59:22.170 --> 59:23.046
Mm-hmm.

59:23.171 --> 59:24.423
I would like a salad "Nicoisee..."

59:24.506 --> 59:25.632
with ranch dressing on it.

59:25.716 --> 59:28.135
Wait, wait, baby,
low-cal ranch dressing.

59:28.218 --> 59:29.678
Oh, that's right.
I'm still on my diet.

59:29.761 --> 59:32.681
So, I would like low-cal
ranch dressing with no oil.

59:32.764 --> 59:35.183
And could you sprinkle
some bacon bits on top?

59:35.267 --> 59:37.477
McDonald's is in Avignon,

59:37.561 --> 59:40.272
<i>fish and chips, Marseille.
Allez.</i>

59:40.355 --> 59:41.773
You people got some serious attitude around here.

59:58.332 --> 01:00:00.000
Here are your tips.

01:00:00.125 --> 01:00:01.376
Thank you for your help.

01:00:02.461 --> 01:00:03.378
You're fired.

01:00:07.090 --> 01:00:10.093
You know, my vigneron said that

01:00:10.177 --> 01:00:11.595
you grew up around Gord.

01:00:11.678 --> 01:00:13.931
Monsieur Duflot is mistaken.

01:00:14.056 --> 01:00:17.434
I only visited Gord during
the summer with my mother.

01:00:17.517 --> 01:00:18.894
I used to spend my summers here.

01:00:20.103 --> 01:00:21.897
I wonder if we ever met.

01:00:25.984 --> 01:00:29.738
Well, if we did,
I hope I was unbearable.

01:00:31.073 --> 01:00:33.450
You're a local.
You'd know the answer to this.

01:00:33.533 --> 01:00:38.997
Where would a young man,
recently cashed up, take someone

01:00:39.081 --> 01:00:41.291
for a drink?

01:00:41.416 --> 01:00:43.585
What?

01:00:43.669 --> 01:00:46.171
Are you asking me on a date?

01:00:49.091 --> 01:00:51.385
No, it's more of an apology.

01:00:51.510 --> 01:00:54.471
I just don't, uh, want you to
think I'm the sort of maniac

01:00:54.596 --> 01:00:56.473
who goes around running people
off the road.

01:00:56.557 --> 01:00:58.559
I'm not interested.

01:00:59.810 --> 01:01:00.769
Have a good night.

01:01:35.178 --> 01:01:36.889
Sunday night, 8:00.

01:01:37.014 --> 01:01:38.140
Place de I'Etang.

01:01:38.223 --> 01:01:40.809
Don't be late.

01:01:40.893 --> 01:01:42.436
I shall see you then.

01:01:49.318 --> 01:01:50.485
Oh, my God.

01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:51.653
Help! Scorpions!

01:01:51.737 --> 01:01:53.155
- Scorpions!
- Maddy!

01:01:53.238 --> 01:01:54.156
Help!

01:01:54.239 --> 01:01:56.408
Oh, my god!

01:01:56.533 --> 01:01:57.200
<i>Et voila!</i>

01:01:58.035 --> 01:02:00.120
<i>Et voila.</i>

01:02:00.245 --> 01:02:01.747
<i>- La lavande...
- No, no!</i>

01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:05.042
<i>La lavande...</i>

01:02:21.725 --> 01:02:22.976
<i>Merci.</i>

01:02:23.101 --> 01:02:25.187
You're welcome.

01:02:56.009 --> 01:02:57.594
You dance very well, Ludivine.

01:02:57.678 --> 01:02:59.805
Thank you.

01:02:59.930 --> 01:03:02.057
I miss Henry.

01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:03.809
He was an excellent dancer.

01:03:03.934 --> 01:03:05.477
Yeah.

01:03:07.938 --> 01:03:08.939
- Do you want to dance?
- Oh, oh, oh...

01:03:09.064 --> 01:03:10.107
Oh, what happened?

01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:12.317
Uh, the tennis with
(clears throat) Francis.

01:03:12.442 --> 01:03:14.611
Oh, poor boy. Do you
want me to put a bandage?

01:03:14.736 --> 01:03:15.821
No.

01:03:15.946 --> 01:03:16.655
Antiseptic?

01:03:16.780 --> 01:03:17.990
No.

01:03:18.115 --> 01:03:20.284
Oh, you are coming

01:03:20.409 --> 01:03:24.830
<i>to our house tonight,
manger ce soir, to our home.</i>

01:03:24.955 --> 01:03:25.998
<i>Oui.</i>

01:03:26.123 --> 01:03:27.040
<i>- Huh?
- Oui.</i>

01:03:27.165 --> 01:03:30.502
I am cooking for you, Max.

01:03:33.005 --> 01:03:34.172
<i>Merci.</i>

01:03:58.572 --> 01:03:59.489
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:03:59.573 --> 01:04:01.825
<i>Vous parlez français?</i>

01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:03.660
<i>Ouais.</i>

01:04:03.785 --> 01:04:07.497
Francis Duflot, vigneron.

01:04:07.581 --> 01:04:09.541
Christie Roberts.

01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:10.834
Illegitimate daughter.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:14.546
The resemblance to
Henry is unmistakable.

01:04:14.671 --> 01:04:15.631
The nose.

01:04:17.049 --> 01:04:21.511
For 23 years, I toiled
side-by-side with your father.

01:04:21.595 --> 01:04:25.891
Even now, he works from
there and I from here.

01:04:26.016 --> 01:04:28.977
That's when I first
planted the vines.

01:04:29.102 --> 01:04:31.688
But now they are sad and tired.

01:04:31.813 --> 01:04:32.689
Except here.

01:04:32.814 --> 01:04:35.192
Here?
No, it's catastrophic.

01:04:35.275 --> 01:04:38.362
Nothing but rocks and grief.

01:04:38.445 --> 01:04:40.906
Limestones absorb the sunlight.

01:04:40.989 --> 01:04:42.908
Keep the vines warm at night.

01:04:44.576 --> 01:04:46.078
Wine brat.

01:04:46.203 --> 01:04:48.538
I spent summers working
in a vineyard in California.

01:04:48.664 --> 01:04:50.082
Oui, mais...

01:04:50.207 --> 01:04:52.251
In California, they don't make wine.

01:04:52.376 --> 01:04:53.710
They make Hawaiian Punch.

01:04:53.794 --> 01:04:56.338
Mondavi might argue with that one.

01:04:56.421 --> 01:04:57.589
Maybe Henry's daughter

01:04:57.714 --> 01:05:00.092
would be interested in
a personal tour in the vines.

01:05:00.175 --> 01:05:02.052
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:05:02.135 --> 01:05:04.972
If we are lucky,
his spirit will join us.

01:05:21.029 --> 01:05:23.448
Paid to the order
of Francois Hupert, the plumber?

01:05:23.574 --> 01:05:24.491
How much?

01:05:24.616 --> 01:05:26.702
Uh, 87 francs.

01:05:26.785 --> 01:05:28.537
Mm...

01:05:28.620 --> 01:05:29.997
sign!

01:05:30.122 --> 01:05:33.083
Henry Skinner.

01:05:34.418 --> 01:05:36.086
- Next?
- The mechanic.

01:05:36.211 --> 01:05:38.130
Not a sous to that grease monkey.

01:05:38.255 --> 01:05:41.216
The old Jag's still coughing
like your Aunt Midge.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.593
Next.

01:05:42.718 --> 01:05:44.469
Uh, Jean-Pierre Lesourdre.

01:05:44.595 --> 01:05:45.762
How much?

01:05:45.846 --> 01:05:46.930
How much?

01:05:47.014 --> 01:05:47.973
2,000 francs.

01:05:48.056 --> 01:05:49.975
Huh? Uh, okay, okay.

01:05:51.643 --> 01:05:54.479
You're a genius, Maximillian.

01:05:54.605 --> 01:05:56.273
You could be me.

01:05:57.691 --> 01:05:59.151
The photos worked like a charm.

01:05:59.234 --> 01:06:00.152
MAX: Really?

01:06:00.235 --> 01:06:01.653
Yeah, massive interest, Max.

01:06:01.778 --> 01:06:02.738
Wonderful.

01:06:02.821 --> 01:06:04.615
Yes, money, money, money,
money, money.

01:06:04.698 --> 01:06:07.451
So I decided it's time
I was on-site.

01:06:07.534 --> 01:06:09.411
So I booked a flight.

01:06:09.494 --> 01:06:11.121
I'll be with you tomorrow afternoon.

01:06:11.204 --> 01:06:12.289
Terrific.

01:06:12.414 --> 01:06:15.042
Well, I'll alert the staff
and chain up the dogs.

01:06:15.167 --> 01:06:16.627
What do you mean, chain up the dogs?

01:06:16.710 --> 01:06:19.129
No, I don't have any dogs,
Charlie, that's a...

01:06:19.213 --> 01:06:21.298
that's just a figure of speech,
eh? Okay, bye.

01:06:47.366 --> 01:06:49.284
Max!

01:06:49.368 --> 01:06:51.078
Pretty cool, huh?

01:06:51.203 --> 01:06:52.412
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

01:06:54.373 --> 01:06:55.290
<i>Ça va?</i>

01:06:55.374 --> 01:06:57.084
<i>Ça va...</i>

01:06:57.209 --> 01:06:58.460
<i>Allez, we must have an appero.</i>

01:06:58.544 --> 01:07:01.380
We must have a big one.
Look at that.

01:07:07.010 --> 01:07:08.428
Ah, Ludivine.

01:07:08.554 --> 01:07:11.682
<i>Ah, non, non, non,
je ne veux pas- Maxie!</i>

01:07:11.765 --> 01:07:12.849
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

01:07:12.933 --> 01:07:13.850
Hello.

01:07:13.976 --> 01:07:15.185
<i>Ça va?</i>

01:07:15.310 --> 01:07:16.144
<i>Ça va?</i>

01:07:16.228 --> 01:07:17.521
<i>Oh, merci.</i>

01:07:17.604 --> 01:07:19.648
<i>C'est gentil, merci, merci, merci...</i>

01:07:19.731 --> 01:07:20.732
Of course.

01:07:26.154 --> 01:07:27.864
Ah, I took the liberty

01:07:27.948 --> 01:07:30.367
of inviting Henry's
daughter to join us.

01:07:35.455 --> 01:07:36.206
<i>Pastis?</i>

01:07:36.331 --> 01:07:37.291
<i>- Oui.
- Allez.</i>

01:07:38.166 --> 01:07:39.710
<i>Bonsoir, coz.</i>

01:07:39.835 --> 01:07:41.128
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

01:07:42.212 --> 01:07:43.881
I see you've managed

01:07:43.964 --> 01:07:45.757
to ingratiate yourself
with the hired help.

01:07:47.426 --> 01:07:48.552
Where'd you get the Halston?

01:07:48.635 --> 01:07:49.928
Dad's closet.

01:07:50.053 --> 01:07:51.722
Ta-da.

01:07:51.805 --> 01:07:54.516
I wonder what she wore home.

01:07:54.600 --> 01:07:57.561
A simple meal after a day's work
in the fields.

01:07:57.644 --> 01:07:59.021
Eggplant...

01:07:59.104 --> 01:08:01.982
Caviar de Bergine-very good.
Headless larks.

01:08:02.107 --> 01:08:04.067
Where are the heads? We didn't,
like, eat them already, did we?

01:08:04.192 --> 01:08:05.068
No, no, no.

01:08:05.193 --> 01:08:07.029
Uh, mushrooms of the region.

01:08:07.112 --> 01:08:09.239
<i>Et voila...</i>

01:08:09.323 --> 01:08:12.868
And finally civet
of wild boar

01:08:12.951 --> 01:08:16.580
marinated in red wine and blood
pressed from the carcass.

01:08:16.705 --> 01:08:18.957
Why would you have it any other way?

01:08:19.082 --> 01:08:21.042
<i>Allez, attaque.
Ludivine?</i>

01:08:21.126 --> 01:08:22.544
Help, help.

01:08:22.627 --> 01:08:24.129
Wine, Max?

01:08:24.254 --> 01:08:25.296
La Siroque?

01:08:25.421 --> 01:08:26.298
<i>Mais non.</i>

01:08:26.423 --> 01:08:27.090
Uh... Christie?

01:08:27.216 --> 01:08:28.716
- Wine?
- No, I'm okay.

01:08:32.095 --> 01:08:33.805
Oh, Papa.

01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:39.060
Papa speaks Provençal.

01:08:39.185 --> 01:08:40.103
You know?

01:08:40.187 --> 01:08:42.104
Oh, but very few
still understand it.

01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:44.774
It's now exclusively practiced

01:08:44.899 --> 01:08:47.903
by poets and sodomites.

01:08:48.028 --> 01:08:49.947
What a sodomite is, by the way?

01:08:50.029 --> 01:08:52.573
I will explain you tonight.

01:08:53.492 --> 01:08:55.285
Francis.

01:08:55.368 --> 01:08:56.662
Mmm...

01:08:56.787 --> 01:08:58.162
Mmm...

01:08:58.287 --> 01:08:59.957
The asparagus is-is lovely.

01:09:00.082 --> 01:09:01.542
Mmm, thank you.

01:09:01.625 --> 01:09:03.794
Very chewy, but...

01:09:03.919 --> 01:09:05.002
Iovely.

01:09:05.127 --> 01:09:06.129
Eh, bravo, eh, Ludivine?

01:09:06.255 --> 01:09:08.131
And the boar, mmm!

01:09:08.256 --> 01:09:11.385
Perhaps the best boar I've had.

01:09:11.468 --> 01:09:12.553
Can I have some bread, please?

01:09:12.636 --> 01:09:14.304
Oh, yeah.

01:09:15.846 --> 01:09:18.767
Francis, Francis?

01:09:18.850 --> 01:09:21.687
<i>Papa, donne-moi ca, Papa.</i>

01:09:24.022 --> 01:09:25.607
Sorry.

01:09:25.691 --> 01:09:27.149
<i>C'est Le Coin Perdu.</i>

01:09:27.276 --> 01:09:28.944
<i>It's a local vin de garage, c'est...</i>

01:09:29.027 --> 01:09:30.112
<i>"Vin de garage?"</i>

01:09:30.237 --> 01:09:31.697
It's a garage wine.

01:09:31.822 --> 01:09:33.365
Like a boutique wine.

01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:36.118
Small vineyards, small productions.

01:09:36.243 --> 01:09:38.287
Seriously big prices.

01:09:38.412 --> 01:09:40.205
It's overrated.

01:09:40.330 --> 01:09:42.666
It didn't say that on the Web.

01:09:42.791 --> 01:09:45.794
Turns out Le Coin Perdu
is a Provençal legend.

01:09:45.919 --> 01:09:47.379
It changes hands
among collectors,

01:09:47.504 --> 01:09:49.631
but nobody knows who makes it.

01:09:49.715 --> 01:09:52.175
<i>Well, uh, it's time for fromage.</i>

01:09:52.301 --> 01:09:53.468
Okay?

01:09:53.551 --> 01:09:55.137
You want, uh, fromage, cheese?

01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:57.306
<i>- Allez.
- Allez.</i>

01:09:57.431 --> 01:09:59.892
And now, now...

01:10:00.017 --> 01:10:00.976
Papa? Papa?

01:10:01.059 --> 01:10:02.853
Trouble you for a spot of the Coin?

01:10:02.978 --> 01:10:04.479
You know what it is, Christie?

01:10:04.563 --> 01:10:07.024
It is Mar de Provence.
I made it myself.

01:10:07.107 --> 01:10:08.775
Wow.

01:10:08.859 --> 01:10:10.152
It's a little bit strong.

01:10:10.235 --> 01:10:11.278
But very good.

01:10:11.361 --> 01:10:12.988
Chin-chin.

01:10:13.071 --> 01:10:14.031
It's your father's recipe.

01:10:14.114 --> 01:10:15.574
Yes.

01:10:15.699 --> 01:10:16.533
Max.

01:10:16.617 --> 01:10:17.451
<i>- Little bit?
- Oui, merci.</i>

01:10:17.534 --> 01:10:18.785
Tell-Tell us, Madame Duflot,

01:10:18.869 --> 01:10:23.373
what is it that makes you so
certain she is Henry's child?

01:10:23.498 --> 01:10:25.375
Oh, but of course.

01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.211
The nose.

01:10:27.336 --> 01:10:28.545
Oh, the nose.

01:10:28.670 --> 01:10:30.756
The glorious snout.
The prominent proboscis.

01:10:30.881 --> 01:10:33.717
Is there something else? Anything?

01:10:33.800 --> 01:10:35.844
No? Anything that might help

01:10:35.969 --> 01:10:37.971
corroborate Christie's claim?

01:10:40.265 --> 01:10:42.142
Henry ever discuss California?

01:10:44.728 --> 01:10:47.481
Did he ever mention a woman
in California?

01:10:49.358 --> 01:10:51.526
It's funny, isn't it?
Any moments of drunken candor

01:10:51.652 --> 01:10:55.739
where he might have mentioned offspring?

01:10:55.864 --> 01:10:56.990
No?

01:10:57.074 --> 01:10:58.533
I mean, seriously.

01:10:58.617 --> 01:11:00.911
Oh, because the last person that

01:11:01.036 --> 01:11:03.914
Henry would ever consciously
breed with would be an American.

01:11:03.997 --> 01:11:05.332
Yes, but, uh, in this moment,

01:11:05.415 --> 01:11:08.669
I see more of Henry in Christie
than I do in you.

01:11:10.087 --> 01:11:11.713
Max...

01:11:11.838 --> 01:11:14.883
all I want is to learn
about my father.

01:11:14.967 --> 01:11:18.053
This is my chance to find
out who made me and...

01:11:18.136 --> 01:11:21.640
I don't care if you
believe me or not.

01:11:26.395 --> 01:11:27.479
Oh!

01:11:27.604 --> 01:11:28.939
Oh.

01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:32.526
<i>Monsieur...</i>

01:11:32.609 --> 01:11:35.445
<i>Madame...
Papa Duflot...</i>

01:11:35.571 --> 01:11:36.572
thanks for a lovely evening.

01:11:36.697 --> 01:11:38.574
Oh, Papa will walk you back.

01:11:38.657 --> 01:11:39.825
No, Ludivine, no.

01:11:41.034 --> 01:11:41.910
The vines will guide me.

01:11:41.994 --> 01:11:43.912
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

01:11:45.873 --> 01:11:46.832
Good night.

01:11:46.957 --> 01:11:48.417
- Whoa.
- It's okay?

01:11:48.542 --> 01:11:49.835
I'm okay.

01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.086
Oh.

01:12:14.276 --> 01:12:15.277
What are you doing?

01:12:15.402 --> 01:12:17.988
I lost my shoe.

01:12:18.113 --> 01:12:19.114
What?

01:12:19.197 --> 01:12:21.158
I lost my shoe.

01:12:21.283 --> 01:12:23.869
Why can't Henry be my dad?

01:12:23.994 --> 01:12:26.038
Well, because now that
he's back in my life,

01:12:26.163 --> 01:12:27.915
I'm not sure that
I want to share him.

01:12:27.998 --> 01:12:29.666
You don't believe me, do you?

01:12:29.791 --> 01:12:31.752
Look, Christie, it's not a matter of that.

01:12:31.835 --> 01:12:36.173
Ludivine told me your parents
died when you were young.

01:12:36.256 --> 01:12:39.760
You know, I... grew up
without a dad, too.

01:12:39.843 --> 01:12:41.345
Doesn't it matter to you

01:12:41.470 --> 01:12:44.973
that I may be the only
blood relative you have?

01:12:46.350 --> 01:12:48.685
Yes, it does. That's why
I need to be sure.

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.574
Whoa... whoa!

01:13:16.672 --> 01:13:18.715
This was my room
when I was a little boy.

01:13:20.926 --> 01:13:23.470
Sleeping here...

01:13:23.554 --> 01:13:26.682
it was the safest place
in the world.

01:13:26.765 --> 01:13:30.811
No bedtimes, no chores.

01:13:30.894 --> 01:13:33.230
No squabbling adults.

01:13:33.313 --> 01:13:35.983
I loved Henry deeply,
but I never got

01:13:36.066 --> 01:13:38.569
around to telling him.

01:13:38.652 --> 01:13:41.238
It's a shitty feeling.

01:13:45.158 --> 01:13:47.911
He was someone who saved my life.

01:13:56.753 --> 01:13:58.755
Thanks a million, Maximillian.

01:14:03.010 --> 01:14:05.220
Bloody hell, Henry.
Oh, where does it come back in?

01:14:05.304 --> 01:14:07.097
- Where does it come back in?
- Maxie!

01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.099
Bugger cooked the books.

01:14:16.857 --> 01:14:18.066
Yes?

01:14:18.191 --> 01:14:19.735
Max, my boy.

01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:21.403
Amis, you old cheese.

01:14:21.528 --> 01:14:23.447
So sorry to hear you're out.

01:14:23.572 --> 01:14:25.073
Well, as usual, Amis,

01:14:25.198 --> 01:14:28.368
the only thing right about your intelligence
is that it's all wrong.

01:14:28.452 --> 01:14:30.329
Then again, you always were
at the back of the conga line.

01:14:30.454 --> 01:14:33.290
You've crossed the line
one too many times, "Sinner."

01:14:33.415 --> 01:14:35.250
You little runt!

01:14:35.334 --> 01:14:38.629
By the by, thank you so much for
your very generous contribution

01:14:38.754 --> 01:14:40.464
to my Aston Martin fund.

01:14:40.547 --> 01:14:41.965
Did you get the flowers?

01:14:42.049 --> 01:14:44.009
What flowers?
What are you talking about?

01:14:44.134 --> 01:14:46.970
...little schemes and ploys...
- Do go on.

01:14:47.054 --> 01:14:48.180
Well, you're nothing.

01:14:48.305 --> 01:14:49.431
Plonker.

01:14:49.514 --> 01:14:51.099
Oi! I heard that.

01:14:51.183 --> 01:14:52.809
Who you calling a plonker?

01:14:52.935 --> 01:14:54.436
You fat prat.

01:14:54.519 --> 01:14:56.021
Hey? Hello?

01:14:56.146 --> 01:14:57.773
<i>- Skinner?
- Bonjour.</i>

01:14:57.898 --> 01:15:00.817
Hello. I'm Jean-Marie Bougnier.

01:15:00.943 --> 01:15:02.611
Yes?

01:15:02.694 --> 01:15:04.029
I've come to test the vines.

01:15:04.154 --> 01:15:05.280
- Oh, the oenologue!
- Yeah.

01:15:05.405 --> 01:15:08.325
Right, great. Um, well, grab
your boots and off we go.

01:15:08.408 --> 01:15:10.410
Yeah.

01:15:11.495 --> 01:15:14.581
(cell phone ringing)

01:15:14.665 --> 01:15:16.792
Gemma, long time.

01:15:16.917 --> 01:15:20.671
Max, I've just had a vision
of you serving Kenny

01:15:20.754 --> 01:15:22.506
a latte at Starbucks.

01:15:22.631 --> 01:15:25.008
Getting comfortable
in my chair, is he?

01:15:25.092 --> 01:15:26.134
Yeah, listen.

01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:31.014
Remember, we are not here
for the dental plan.

01:15:31.139 --> 01:15:32.808
Sell, sell.

01:15:32.933 --> 01:15:35.978
He's even taking credit
for your trade this week.

01:15:36.061 --> 01:15:39.898
He's telling everyone in
the office that he was the one

01:15:40.023 --> 01:15:41.316
that gave you the idea.

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:43.569
Well, if he wasn't an ambitious
and mercenary little bastard,

01:15:43.694 --> 01:15:46.029
I never would have given him
the job in the first place.

01:15:46.154 --> 01:15:48.031
Yeah, but, Max,
he's really trying to take...

01:15:48.156 --> 01:15:49.950
Gemma... just
give him his head

01:15:50.033 --> 01:15:51.535
and let him do what he needs to do.

01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.161
<i>All right?
Tout a I'heure, Gemma.</i>

01:15:53.287 --> 01:15:54.830
<i>Tout a I'heure.</i>

01:15:57.958 --> 01:15:59.626
Well...

01:15:59.710 --> 01:16:00.669
<i>Piquette.</i>

01:16:00.752 --> 01:16:02.713
Wonderful, wonderful.

01:16:02.796 --> 01:16:05.340
No, no, it mean, um...
it is bad, you know?

01:16:05.465 --> 01:16:06.925
Yeah.

01:16:07.050 --> 01:16:09.261
Uh... shit.

01:16:12.764 --> 01:16:14.850
Chicken shit, no?

01:16:17.311 --> 01:16:19.396
It's very terrible,
this one, you know?

01:16:19.521 --> 01:16:23.400
<i>It's like, um, in French
we say, um... mort.</i>

01:16:23.525 --> 01:16:24.610
It's completely dead.

01:16:24.735 --> 01:16:26.904
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God.

01:16:27.029 --> 01:16:28.071
Look at this one; this is a...

01:16:28.196 --> 01:16:30.115
It's a baby.
It is a baby.

01:16:30.240 --> 01:16:32.159
Look at it.

01:16:32.242 --> 01:16:34.286
I test this one.

01:16:37.122 --> 01:16:38.665
Wow.

01:16:38.749 --> 01:16:40.209
Catastrophe.

01:16:40.292 --> 01:16:42.085
Very, very bad.

01:16:42.169 --> 01:16:44.004
I am really sorry. Eh!

01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:52.721
More like a quarry than a vineyard.

01:16:54.264 --> 01:16:56.058
Look at this-you know what it mean?

01:16:57.309 --> 01:17:00.103
You cut off two of
every three bunches.

01:17:00.229 --> 01:17:03.357
What's left gets all the nourishment,
you know?

01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:06.193
And why would you do that?

01:17:06.276 --> 01:17:08.904
Perhaps the peasants
got the time to salvage

01:17:08.987 --> 01:17:10.572
what they could, you know?

01:17:14.243 --> 01:17:15.619
Right, um...

01:17:15.744 --> 01:17:16.912
I think I follow you.

01:17:17.037 --> 01:17:19.998
Um, so wh-what's the verdict?

01:17:20.123 --> 01:17:21.917
Despite your vigneron's

01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.586
unbearable faults, you know,

01:17:24.670 --> 01:17:28.131
<i>this terroir is beyond help.</i>

01:17:28.215 --> 01:17:31.510
Nothing, um... shit.

01:17:31.635 --> 01:17:33.512
Nothing. No.

01:17:33.637 --> 01:17:38.058
You might consider growing
potatoes or squash.

01:17:39.893 --> 01:17:43.063
I will have my office
send a report

01:17:43.146 --> 01:17:44.481
and my invoice.

01:17:44.606 --> 01:17:46.441
Thank you.

01:17:51.446 --> 01:17:52.906
Oi!

01:17:52.990 --> 01:17:54.324
Wakey, wakey, beach bunny.

01:17:54.408 --> 01:17:55.951
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

01:17:56.076 --> 01:17:57.870
These are Henry's private papers.

01:17:57.995 --> 01:17:59.663
They're irreplaceable.

01:18:01.164 --> 01:18:04.126
Did you know Dad mixed a martini
for Winston Churchill?

01:18:04.209 --> 01:18:09.464
He also danced a waltz
with Amelia Earhart in 1975.

01:18:09.548 --> 01:18:12.009
Well, considering Amelia
Earhart died in the 1930s,

01:18:12.134 --> 01:18:13.594
that's a perfect
example of the type

01:18:13.677 --> 01:18:15.345
of exaggerator Uncle Henry was.

01:18:15.470 --> 01:18:17.347
Want to know the real Uncle Henry?

01:18:17.431 --> 01:18:20.225
Not the one your overactive
imagination is manufacturing?

01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:21.977
The real Henry Skinner
was a man so afraid

01:18:22.102 --> 01:18:23.770
of committing to the real world

01:18:23.854 --> 01:18:25.981
that he retreated from life
to drink and shag his way

01:18:26.064 --> 01:18:27.357
to a lonely and loveless end!

01:18:29.401 --> 01:18:32.779
Everything I need to know
about my dad is right here.

01:18:32.863 --> 01:18:35.407
It's right in front of me.

01:18:35.532 --> 01:18:38.118
You know, and if this place
meant as much to him

01:18:38.202 --> 01:18:40.537
as I believe it did,

01:18:40.621 --> 01:18:41.788
you're worse than I thought

01:18:41.872 --> 01:18:43.749
for even thinking about selling it.

01:18:50.422 --> 01:18:53.508
I'll leave tomorrow.

01:19:44.226 --> 01:19:45.644
Uncle Henry!

01:19:45.769 --> 01:19:46.728
Let's see you then.

01:19:46.812 --> 01:19:49.940
- One, two, and go!
- Yay!

01:20:14.923 --> 01:20:15.883
Yes?

01:20:15.966 --> 01:20:17.259
Hello.

01:20:17.342 --> 01:20:18.635
You working out on the house?

01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:20.387
Charlie.

01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:21.680
Yes, at it since daybreak.

01:20:21.805 --> 01:20:23.265
Really.

01:20:23.348 --> 01:20:26.184
I hate to think of you toiling
down there, all on your own.

01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:28.270
We're English, Charlie, you know?

01:20:28.395 --> 01:20:30.314
Born to rule and sacrifice.

01:20:30.397 --> 01:20:31.523
Yes.

01:20:31.648 --> 01:20:33.275
Where are you?

01:20:33.400 --> 01:20:35.152
- I'm outside.

01:20:37.988 --> 01:20:40.449
Wow.

01:20:41.825 --> 01:20:43.911
Max, take my original estimate

01:20:43.994 --> 01:20:45.787
- and shove it up my ass.
- Shh!

01:20:45.871 --> 01:20:47.539
- If I can't get you $5 million
- Charlie, shh-shh...

01:20:47.664 --> 01:20:49.541
for this baby, I'm in the wrong sport.

01:20:49.666 --> 01:20:51.126
What?

01:20:51.210 --> 01:20:53.837
What?

01:20:53.962 --> 01:20:55.130
Oh, dear.

01:20:55.255 --> 01:20:56.215
Huh?

01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:58.550
This is a disaster.

01:20:58.675 --> 01:21:00.594
Mr. Froggy Wineman

01:21:00.677 --> 01:21:02.554
has just knocked a million
off our sale price.

01:21:02.679 --> 01:21:03.680
Oh, bugger it, you know?

01:21:03.805 --> 01:21:05.182
We just go to plan two, right?

01:21:05.265 --> 01:21:07.351
Just flog it as fast as we can
for as much as we can.

01:21:07.476 --> 01:21:09.853
And just keep in mind
that the vigneron, Duflot,

01:21:09.937 --> 01:21:11.772
he stays on
as part of the deal, okay?

01:21:11.855 --> 01:21:12.940
- I'll do my best.
- Right.

01:21:13.023 --> 01:21:14.233
Max?

01:21:14.358 --> 01:21:16.109
So what's on the agenda
for this evening?

01:21:16.193 --> 01:21:17.569
<i>Steak frite?</i>

01:21:17.694 --> 01:21:19.821
Bottle of pastis?
Evening game of bridge?

01:21:19.905 --> 01:21:21.114
Charlie.

01:21:21.198 --> 01:21:22.824
Charlie, please;
real men don't play bridge,

01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:25.160
and, uh, I have a...

01:21:25.244 --> 01:21:27.996
an obligatory cultural activity
in the village this evening.

01:21:28.080 --> 01:21:29.248
Can I come?

01:21:29.373 --> 01:21:30.582
Will there be girls?

01:21:30.707 --> 01:21:33.669
No and yes.

01:21:35.379 --> 01:21:38.215
So you're leaving
your best friend alone

01:21:38.340 --> 01:21:41.718
in an eerie château
on his first night?

01:21:41.802 --> 01:21:43.095
Charlie.

01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:46.348
No. I'm leaving you alone.

01:21:46.473 --> 01:21:49.601
And, um, you're not as alone
as you think you are.

01:21:49.726 --> 01:21:50.936
You'll find a friend.

01:21:51.061 --> 01:21:52.813
Okay?

01:22:17.087 --> 01:22:18.213
Max.

01:22:18.297 --> 01:22:20.132
We thought you were dead.

01:22:20.257 --> 01:22:21.967
Kenny, I've heard the word
that Monday's auction

01:22:22.092 --> 01:22:23.468
is going to trade like a turd.

01:22:23.594 --> 01:22:24.803
Oh, yeah?

01:22:24.928 --> 01:22:25.971
A smart move

01:22:26.096 --> 01:22:31.226
would be to sell 28 gilt short
at, say, 99.10.

01:22:31.351 --> 01:22:32.561
Good grief.

01:22:32.644 --> 01:22:34.104
Are you sure?

01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:35.731
It's risky as hell;
it'd seriously piss off the markets.

01:22:35.814 --> 01:22:37.065
Now, of course,

01:22:37.190 --> 01:22:39.401
I'm not allowed to do
the trading, Kenny, but, uh,

01:22:39.484 --> 01:22:41.612
I'm sure that you'll share
the credit with me

01:22:41.737 --> 01:22:42.696
when the bouquets are passed around.

01:22:42.779 --> 01:22:44.573
- Yes?
- All right, Max.

01:22:44.656 --> 01:22:47.242
- See you later.
- Righto.

01:22:47.367 --> 01:22:50.370
Boss, someone is shorting
Monday's gilt auction.

01:22:52.831 --> 01:22:55.209
Skinner.

01:22:55.292 --> 01:22:58.295
Not this time, you miserable sod.

01:22:59.755 --> 01:23:01.882
Buy!

01:23:01.965 --> 01:23:04.718
Get your hands
on as much as you can.

01:23:30.744 --> 01:23:31.954
Hello.

01:23:32.037 --> 01:23:34.498
Hello.

01:23:34.623 --> 01:23:36.041
Anyone there?

01:23:37.125 --> 01:23:38.710
Hello?

01:23:38.835 --> 01:23:40.420
Who are you?

01:23:40.504 --> 01:23:43.090
I'm Charlie's friend Max.

01:23:43.173 --> 01:23:44.508
No, I'm not.

01:23:44.591 --> 01:23:46.301
I'm Max's friend Charlie.

01:23:46.385 --> 01:23:49.972
Okay, Max's friend.

01:23:50.055 --> 01:23:54.518
I need you to come up here
and take a look at my back.

01:23:59.022 --> 01:24:01.275
Thanks.

01:24:15.706 --> 01:24:18.917
Have I told you you're a vision?

01:24:19.042 --> 01:24:21.628
<i>Oui, from the bottom of the pool,</i>

01:24:21.712 --> 01:24:23.463
when you were peeking up my skirt.

01:24:23.547 --> 01:24:25.048
Gosh, guilty as charged.

01:24:25.132 --> 01:24:26.550
Sorry about that.

01:24:28.468 --> 01:24:30.262
<i>- Bonsoir. You look lovely.
- Bonsoir.</i>

01:24:30.387 --> 01:24:31.847
You, too.

01:24:31.930 --> 01:24:35.100
Sartorial elegance by Henri.

01:24:35.225 --> 01:24:37.436
Wow.

01:24:37.561 --> 01:24:39.563
Le Coin Perdu?

01:24:41.064 --> 01:24:42.858
I've never actually seen a bottle.

01:24:42.941 --> 01:24:44.318
Have you heard of it?

01:24:44.401 --> 01:24:46.236
It's expensive.

01:24:46.236 --> 01:24:47.112
It's expensive.

01:24:47.195 --> 01:24:49.198
Are you trying to seduce me, Max?

01:24:49.323 --> 01:24:51.450
Oh, gosh.
No, of course not.

01:24:51.533 --> 01:24:52.993
The thought would never
even cross my mind,

01:24:53.076 --> 01:24:54.661
not more than six or ten times.

01:24:57.497 --> 01:24:58.624
Um...

01:25:00.667 --> 01:25:02.085
Eh, right now,

01:25:02.169 --> 01:25:04.254
it's sort of the color of...

01:25:04.338 --> 01:25:06.173
ripe pomegranate.

01:25:07.758 --> 01:25:09.176
Bummer.

01:25:09.259 --> 01:25:11.970
Could you, uh... look

01:25:12.095 --> 01:25:14.139
in the medicine cabinet
for some aloe,

01:25:14.223 --> 01:25:16.058
aspirin, bucket of ice.

01:25:16.183 --> 01:25:17.309
Yeah.

01:25:17.434 --> 01:25:20.687
Uh, I'm Christie, by the way.

01:25:20.771 --> 01:25:21.730
Charlie.

01:25:23.023 --> 01:25:23.982
How do you do?

01:25:24.066 --> 01:25:26.026
I love your accent.

01:25:26.109 --> 01:25:27.945
Thanks.

01:25:28.028 --> 01:25:29.738
Love your bum.

01:25:29.738 --> 01:25:30.781
Love your bum.

01:26:04.565 --> 01:26:08.026
There's something you
should know about me, Max.

01:26:08.110 --> 01:26:09.027
Yes?

01:26:09.111 --> 01:26:11.947
I'm very, very choosy.

01:26:12.072 --> 01:26:14.283
Well, I'm very, very honored.

01:26:16.368 --> 01:26:19.830
I'm also very,
very suspicious;

01:26:19.913 --> 01:26:21.790
very, very irrational;

01:26:21.915 --> 01:26:24.001
and I have a very,
very short temper.

01:26:25.919 --> 01:26:29.089
I'm also extremely jealous
and slow to forgive,

01:26:29.214 --> 01:26:30.841
just so you know.

01:26:30.924 --> 01:26:32.342
Well, this promises to be

01:26:32.426 --> 01:26:34.011
- a lovely evening.
- Mm.

01:26:36.513 --> 01:26:38.140
I wouldn't go to Rome.

01:26:38.265 --> 01:26:40.017
It is quite overcrowded.

01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:43.186
I mean, there's more
tourists than pigeons.

01:26:43.270 --> 01:26:46.565
I've got to go somewhere,
maybe Venice. Ow.

01:26:46.648 --> 01:26:48.233
Yeah, but it's sinking.

01:26:48.358 --> 01:26:50.402
You know, one false move,

01:26:50.527 --> 01:26:52.946
fall in the canal- sorry.

01:26:53.071 --> 01:26:54.740
Run down by a gondolier.

01:26:54.865 --> 01:26:57.868
Whereas London has got it all,

01:26:57.951 --> 01:26:59.995
including your own

01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:03.207
<i>personal tour guide: moi.</i>

01:27:03.290 --> 01:27:05.292
Charlie.

01:27:07.211 --> 01:27:08.587
Concentrate.

01:27:08.670 --> 01:27:10.756
Sorry.

01:27:38.909 --> 01:27:40.410
Alone at last.

01:27:40.494 --> 01:27:42.704
You've been candid with me, so I

01:27:42.829 --> 01:27:44.081
should be candid with you.

01:27:46.166 --> 01:27:47.834
I'm famously callous,

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.963
even to the point
of being insensitive.

01:27:52.673 --> 01:27:56.093
And I have an absolute
inability to trust anyone.

01:27:58.303 --> 01:28:02.224
The only person I ever loved
was my Uncle Henry, and...

01:28:02.349 --> 01:28:04.685
I didn't contact him for
the last ten years of his life.

01:28:07.729 --> 01:28:09.898
He often expressed great sadness,

01:28:10.023 --> 01:28:13.777
as though he thought
you had been lost.

01:28:13.860 --> 01:28:15.654
You knew him?

01:28:15.737 --> 01:28:17.447
As a woman living here,

01:28:17.531 --> 01:28:19.408
it was impossible not to know him.

01:28:19.533 --> 01:28:21.368
Right.

01:28:21.493 --> 01:28:22.870
Um, he didn't, by any chance,

01:28:22.953 --> 01:28:24.162
ever get out the Edmundo records

01:28:24.288 --> 01:28:25.873
- And do the, um...

01:28:25.998 --> 01:28:27.666
Rumba?

01:28:29.293 --> 01:28:31.169
No.

01:28:31.253 --> 01:28:33.046
Thank you.

01:28:33.130 --> 01:28:35.007
But of course I tried.

01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:37.885
Well, you would, 'cause he
was absolutely lovable.

01:28:37.968 --> 01:28:41.179
Yes.

01:28:41.305 --> 01:28:42.806
I can't for the life
of me think of why

01:28:42.890 --> 01:28:45.100
I stopped coming down here.

01:28:46.602 --> 01:28:49.229
I love this place.

01:28:49.354 --> 01:28:51.440
It's intoxicating.

01:29:41.698 --> 01:29:43.742
Scorpions! Agh!

01:29:43.867 --> 01:29:45.285
Ow!

01:29:45.369 --> 01:29:46.995
- Scorpions!
- Mm.

01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:51.333
There are scorpions in my bedroom!

01:29:54.753 --> 01:29:57.089
I must go to work.

01:29:57.172 --> 01:29:59.758
Isn't that usually the man's line?

01:30:06.473 --> 01:30:07.975
Do you know the reason

01:30:08.058 --> 01:30:10.727
why I spent the night with you?

01:30:12.813 --> 01:30:17.192
It is because once you have done
what you came here to do,

01:30:17.317 --> 01:30:19.444
you will not return.

01:30:19.528 --> 01:30:23.824
For us, there can be no future.

01:30:23.949 --> 01:30:28.078
There is safety in that.

01:30:29.162 --> 01:30:31.498
Well...

01:30:34.126 --> 01:30:35.502
...there's absolutely nothing

01:30:35.586 --> 01:30:38.964
stopping us from setting up
your café in Notting Hill.

01:30:39.047 --> 01:30:40.549
- London definitely needs

01:30:40.674 --> 01:30:41.508
a decent bistro.

01:30:41.633 --> 01:30:43.343
Mm.

01:30:43.468 --> 01:30:46.597
How typical... to assume

01:30:46.680 --> 01:30:49.933
that I live in Provence
because I have no choice.

01:30:50.017 --> 01:30:53.604
Fanny, this place just
doesn't suit my life.

01:30:53.687 --> 01:30:55.772
No, Max.

01:30:55.856 --> 01:31:00.152
It is your life
that doesn't suit this place.

01:31:04.364 --> 01:31:07.201
<i>Au revoir.</i>

01:31:17.085 --> 01:31:19.338
What happened to the diving board?

01:31:21.381 --> 01:31:22.758
Hmm.

01:31:22.883 --> 01:31:26.094
We did quite well, didn't we?

01:31:26.220 --> 01:31:27.971
Yeah, I don't think we did
too badly, considering

01:31:28.055 --> 01:31:30.557
the oenologue's report.

01:31:34.728 --> 01:31:36.313
You know, Charlie...

01:31:38.398 --> 01:31:40.192
...I think I'm in love.

01:31:40.275 --> 01:31:41.485
I don't blame you, mate.

01:31:41.568 --> 01:31:43.654
She's a goddess,
even if she is your cousin.

01:31:43.737 --> 01:31:45.864
Not Christie, you silly sod.

01:31:45.989 --> 01:31:49.159
My, um...

01:31:49.243 --> 01:31:52.079
my obligatory cultural activity is a girl.

01:31:52.162 --> 01:31:53.914
- Oh.
- A woman.

01:31:54.039 --> 01:31:55.874
Fanny Chenal.

01:31:55.958 --> 01:31:57.626
Ooh, la la.

01:31:59.419 --> 01:32:01.463
I've been thinking,
perhaps I shouldn't sell.

01:32:01.588 --> 01:32:03.048
Max, I think

01:32:03.173 --> 01:32:05.467
at the moment,
your whole body is covered

01:32:05.592 --> 01:32:07.553
in the eau de French girl,

01:32:07.678 --> 01:32:10.013
and when you have
had a cold shower,

01:32:10.097 --> 01:32:12.224
things will look
a little bit different.

01:32:12.307 --> 01:32:14.351
I could keep it as
a pied-a-terre, a weekender,

01:32:14.434 --> 01:32:15.811
holiday house, you know.

01:32:15.936 --> 01:32:18.772
Can I remind you what happened
when your boss and mentor,

01:32:18.897 --> 01:32:23.068
a man you loved, took his
first holiday in 15 years.

01:32:23.193 --> 01:32:24.736
I stole his job.

01:32:24.862 --> 01:32:26.405
Exact.

01:32:26.488 --> 01:32:28.073
Max Skinner doesn't do weekends.

01:32:28.198 --> 01:32:29.616
Max Skinner doesn't take holidays.

01:32:29.700 --> 01:32:31.034
Max Skinner...

01:32:33.704 --> 01:32:35.664
...makes money.

01:32:35.789 --> 01:32:38.250
So do what you do best, Max.

01:32:38.375 --> 01:32:40.711
Hmm?

01:32:40.794 --> 01:32:42.671
If you're going to sell it,

01:32:42.796 --> 01:32:44.715
you got to sign it.

01:32:58.020 --> 01:33:00.147
Shh.

01:33:04.735 --> 01:33:06.778
Why is he singing to them,
Uncle Henry?

01:33:06.904 --> 01:33:08.614
Well, you see, Max,

01:33:08.697 --> 01:33:11.658
<i>the terroir needs more
than southern rain.</i>

01:33:11.742 --> 01:33:14.161
It needs harmony.

01:33:14.244 --> 01:33:16.788
It needs balance.

01:33:32.346 --> 01:33:34.473
My whole life,
people laughed at me

01:33:34.598 --> 01:33:36.225
for singing to the vines.

01:33:36.350 --> 01:33:40.187
I explained that, someday,
the vines would sing back.

01:33:40.312 --> 01:33:42.856
Here, they finally have.

01:33:42.981 --> 01:33:45.859
You don't know what you are doing.

01:33:45.984 --> 01:33:47.361
What are you talking about?

01:33:47.444 --> 01:33:48.529
Here...

01:33:48.654 --> 01:33:50.572
Le Coin Perdu.

01:33:50.697 --> 01:33:52.699
It's not possible.

01:33:52.824 --> 01:33:55.118
The oenologue said you couldn't
even grow squash or potatoes...

01:33:55.202 --> 01:33:56.537
No, no, no, no, no.

01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:59.289
The oenologue was paid to say that.

01:33:59.373 --> 01:34:02.000
We thought that if you believed
La Siroque had no value,

01:34:02.125 --> 01:34:04.920
you would leave things
as they were,

01:34:05.045 --> 01:34:06.672
so the status quo.

01:34:06.797 --> 01:34:08.799
Why didn't you tell me this before?

01:34:08.882 --> 01:34:09.883
Why didn't you trust me?

01:34:09.967 --> 01:34:12.928
Max, would you trust you?

01:34:13.053 --> 01:34:15.389
These vines, they are illegal.

01:34:15.514 --> 01:34:17.808
Your uncle always intended

01:34:17.891 --> 01:34:20.060
to leave the estate to you,

01:34:20.185 --> 01:34:22.437
but he worried about
what you had become.

01:34:22.563 --> 01:34:26.525
"My nephew is selfish,"
he used to say.

01:34:26.650 --> 01:34:28.819
"How can I give this
place to a man

01:34:28.902 --> 01:34:32.239
who can't even appreciate
the simple pleasures of life?"

01:34:32.322 --> 01:34:34.867
So it was never written.

01:34:34.992 --> 01:34:37.911
Plus, fate took him

01:34:38.036 --> 01:34:40.038
before he could decide what to do.

01:34:42.082 --> 01:34:45.210
I've already sold it.

01:34:48.463 --> 01:34:50.674
Then you have done
the very thing

01:34:50.757 --> 01:34:52.259
your uncle feared you would do.

01:34:53.844 --> 01:34:57.639
You have sold his spirit
to the highest bidder, Max,

01:34:57.764 --> 01:35:01.226
and betrayed the only man
who ever cared for you.

01:35:07.816 --> 01:35:09.401
Here, Max.

01:35:11.028 --> 01:35:14.615
Here was Henry's fuck-you money!

01:35:36.136 --> 01:35:37.888
This one.

01:35:37.971 --> 01:35:39.890
Ah, well chosen.

01:35:39.973 --> 01:35:42.476
It's not quite there yet.

01:35:42.559 --> 01:35:44.436
Once you find
something good, Max,

01:35:44.519 --> 01:35:46.396
you have to take care of it.

01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:48.273
You have to let it grow.

01:35:59.368 --> 01:36:01.370
Christie.

01:36:01.495 --> 01:36:03.539
What are you doing?
You can't just leave.

01:36:03.664 --> 01:36:04.540
Sure, I can.

01:36:04.665 --> 01:36:06.124
Well, what about last night?

01:36:06.208 --> 01:36:08.335
I nursed you through
second-degree burns.

01:36:08.460 --> 01:36:10.587
You were sweet.

01:36:10.671 --> 01:36:13.006
And I seriously damaged
the ends of my fingers.

01:36:13.131 --> 01:36:15.092
Frostbitten?

01:36:15.175 --> 01:36:16.969
Like your heart.

01:36:21.348 --> 01:36:23.141
Bye, Charlie.

01:36:23.225 --> 01:36:26.061
Bye, Christie.

01:36:37.447 --> 01:36:38.907
Where you headed?

01:36:39.032 --> 01:36:40.868
Not exactly sure.

01:36:40.993 --> 01:36:42.494
I brought you something.

01:36:42.619 --> 01:36:44.162
Your book.

01:36:44.246 --> 01:36:45.747
You didn't finish it.

01:36:50.711 --> 01:36:52.671
Christie?

01:36:53.881 --> 01:36:56.216
You do have his nose.

01:36:59.219 --> 01:37:00.554
<i>Au revoir.</i>

01:37:00.637 --> 01:37:03.098
<i>Au revoir, coz.</i>

01:37:07.102 --> 01:37:08.896
Dear Max,

01:37:09.021 --> 01:37:11.773
<i>I know it's been many years
since we last spoke,</i>

01:37:11.899 --> 01:37:14.526
<i>but I find myself
in a bit of a jam,</i>

01:37:14.651 --> 01:37:16.904
<i>and I'm afraid I need your help.</i>

01:37:17.029 --> 01:37:20.657
<i>The thing is, Max, old boy, I'm dying.</i>

01:37:20.741 --> 01:37:23.285
<i>I know this because, uh,
Dr. Karr, my physician,</i>

01:37:23.410 --> 01:37:25.746
<i>has stopped talking
about my health</i>

01:37:25.829 --> 01:37:28.123
<i>and begun discussing the weather.</i>

01:37:28.248 --> 01:37:32.294
<i>Convinced that death,
like all tradesmen,</i>

01:37:32.419 --> 01:37:34.963
<i>would be unable
to find my front door,</i>

01:37:35.088 --> 01:37:37.341
<i>and having always
believed wills</i>

01:37:37.424 --> 01:37:39.760
<i>to be written invitations
to the Reaper,</i>

01:37:39.843 --> 01:37:43.305
<i>I find myself impelled
to impress upon your kindness.</i>

01:37:44.514 --> 01:37:48.810
<i>I have a daughter, ;
her name is Christie Roberts.</i>

01:37:48.936 --> 01:37:51.230
<i>Sadly, we have never met.</i>

01:37:51.313 --> 01:37:53.565
<i>Her mother's name was Allison.</i>

01:37:53.690 --> 01:37:57.277
<i>She was a tour guide
at a tiny vineyard</i>

01:37:57.402 --> 01:37:59.530
<i>in Northern California.</i>

01:37:59.613 --> 01:38:01.240
<i>Max, I should like you
to find her,</i>

01:38:01.323 --> 01:38:03.325
<i>and to this end,
I should like to leave her</i>

01:38:03.450 --> 01:38:06.036
<i>what is rightfully hers.</i>

01:38:06.119 --> 01:38:09.248
<i>I hope this decision
doesn't hurt your feelings,</i>

01:38:09.331 --> 01:38:12.251
<i>and as successful as you are,
you don't need it.</i>

01:38:12.334 --> 01:38:14.586
<i>I hope you understand,</i>

01:38:14.711 --> 01:38:17.256
<i>because, for me,
even in its present state,</i>

01:38:17.339 --> 01:38:20.759
<i>La Siroque is a place of magic,</i>

01:38:20.842 --> 01:38:23.303
<i>and it is my heartfelt wish</i>

01:38:23.387 --> 01:38:27.683
<i>that Christie should share
in that magic.</i>

01:38:27.808 --> 01:38:30.352
<i>I like to think ofher here.</i>

01:38:30.477 --> 01:38:34.690
<i>After all, she and La Siroque
are all I leave behind.</i>

01:38:34.815 --> 01:38:36.400
<i>Your loving uncle...</i>

01:38:36.483 --> 01:38:37.901
Your loving uncle,

01:38:37.985 --> 01:38:39.695
Henry Skinner.

01:38:39.820 --> 01:38:43.031
Henry Skinner.

01:38:47.828 --> 01:38:50.539
<i>Il est un petit, um, wrinkle.</i>

01:38:50.664 --> 01:38:52.624
What do you mean? What...
What sort of wrinkle?

01:38:52.708 --> 01:38:53.792
Uh...

01:38:55.836 --> 01:38:58.005
Ah, Genghis, back from the dead.

01:38:58.130 --> 01:38:59.298
Just a lovely tie.

01:38:59.423 --> 01:39:02.134
Do tell your mother
I admire her taste.

01:39:02.259 --> 01:39:03.719
Welcome back, boss.

01:39:03.844 --> 01:39:06.555
Oh... I bet.

01:39:06.680 --> 01:39:08.473
You wanker!

01:39:08.557 --> 01:39:10.434
Kenneth. Nice haircut.

01:39:10.517 --> 01:39:11.643
You set me up.

01:39:11.768 --> 01:39:12.853
Oh, dear boy,

01:39:12.978 --> 01:39:14.646
you haven't been fired
in my absence, have you?

01:39:14.730 --> 01:39:15.856
A short order.

01:39:15.981 --> 01:39:17.900
Did my nuts in
in less than an hour.

01:39:18.025 --> 01:39:19.234
You didn't?
That's unfortunate, dear boy.

01:39:19.359 --> 01:39:22.154
Lost us six million quid.

01:39:22.237 --> 01:39:24.698
Couldn't have anything to do
with me, Kenny. I was suspended.

01:39:24.823 --> 01:39:26.909
You bastard!

01:39:27.034 --> 01:39:28.410
Morning, lab rats.

01:39:28.535 --> 01:39:29.661
- Morning, boss.
- Morning, Max.

01:39:29.786 --> 01:39:31.330
Morning, Max.

01:39:35.959 --> 01:39:38.378
<i>Bonjour, Jasminda.</i>

01:39:40.047 --> 01:39:41.840
<i>Ça va?</i>

01:39:41.924 --> 01:39:43.008
<i>Bonjour?</i>

01:39:45.219 --> 01:39:47.346
You look different.

01:39:47.471 --> 01:39:49.014
Give me everything
I need to read to catch up

01:39:49.097 --> 01:39:50.933
and an espresso.

01:39:51.058 --> 01:39:52.768
Max?

01:39:52.893 --> 01:39:54.311
Hmm?

01:39:54.394 --> 01:39:56.897
Sir Nigel's waiting for you.

01:39:56.980 --> 01:39:59.483
Make it a double.

01:40:30.597 --> 01:40:34.726
<i>Auf Wiederherren.</i>

01:40:41.108 --> 01:40:43.819
Van Gogh.

01:40:45.904 --> 01:40:48.866
Hope you've got a good lock
on the door, sir.

01:40:48.949 --> 01:40:50.325
Don't be soft.

01:40:50.450 --> 01:40:51.577
It's not real.

01:40:51.702 --> 01:40:53.412
The real one's in my vault.

01:40:53.495 --> 01:40:54.872
It's a copy.

01:40:54.955 --> 01:40:57.875
200 grand for a knockoff.

01:40:57.875 --> 01:40:58.792
200 grand for a knockoff.

01:40:58.917 --> 01:41:01.503
Sit.

01:41:02.588 --> 01:41:07.050
Art's a passion, Max.

01:41:07.134 --> 01:41:08.802
Got to have passions.

01:41:08.927 --> 01:41:12.890
I have horses, cars, money...

01:41:12.973 --> 01:41:14.266
Are they passions or vices, sir?

01:41:14.349 --> 01:41:16.268
Have I finished talking?

01:41:18.228 --> 01:41:20.439
When I finish talking,
that's when you talk,

01:41:20.522 --> 01:41:22.482
and it better be good!

01:41:22.608 --> 01:41:25.277
While you've been
on your little holiday,

01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:27.821
I've been in a shitstorm!

01:41:27.905 --> 01:41:32.284
Sir, I do appreciate that my actions
may have caused some...

01:41:32.367 --> 01:41:33.702
Max...

01:41:35.037 --> 01:41:38.332
You're one of the ballsiest
traders in this square mile,

01:41:38.457 --> 01:41:40.209
but you've got to learn
there are consequences

01:41:40.334 --> 01:41:44.004
to your sort of behavior.

01:41:45.047 --> 01:41:47.966
There it is.

01:41:49.092 --> 01:41:52.179
You have one hour.

01:41:55.849 --> 01:41:58.560
So, shall I pack my Smurfs?

01:42:17.746 --> 01:42:19.831
Oh, Max!

01:42:19.915 --> 01:42:21.583
Look after Madame Chenal's
daughter, Fanny,

01:42:21.708 --> 01:42:23.794
while I give her mother
a tour of the estate.

01:42:23.877 --> 01:42:25.754
Uh, but I really want to finish
the last chapter

01:42:25.879 --> 01:42:27.464
<i>of Death in Venice.</i>

01:42:27.548 --> 01:42:29.091
Well, given the book's title,

01:42:29.216 --> 01:42:31.969
I don't think you'll be
surprised by the ending.

01:42:32.052 --> 01:42:33.345
You be good, Fanny.

01:42:33.428 --> 01:42:34.513
Come now, Madame Chenal.

01:42:34.596 --> 01:42:36.348
There are many attractions
here at La Siroque,

01:42:36.473 --> 01:42:40.561
beginning with the view,
as seen from my bedroom.

01:43:40.787 --> 01:43:43.957
That's a lot of zeros, Max.

01:43:44.082 --> 01:43:46.585
Or a full partnership for life.

01:43:46.710 --> 01:43:49.379
My choice.

01:43:50.464 --> 01:43:52.758
Now you listen to Mommy, Max.

01:43:52.841 --> 01:43:56.303
Partner-you're made for life.

01:43:56.386 --> 01:43:58.096
Sir Nigel didn't become partner
till he was 53,

01:43:58.180 --> 01:44:00.682
and look at him.

01:44:00.807 --> 01:44:03.852
Yes.

01:44:03.977 --> 01:44:06.939
Look at him.

01:44:09.566 --> 01:44:12.069
Now what's it to be:
The money

01:44:12.152 --> 01:44:15.489
or your life?

01:44:17.491 --> 01:44:19.284
When do you ever see it, Nige?

01:44:19.368 --> 01:44:21.870
The real one?

01:44:21.995 --> 01:44:23.121
When do you look at it?

01:44:23.205 --> 01:44:25.249
Do you make late-night
pilgrimages down to the vault

01:44:25.332 --> 01:44:27.334
just to see it or?

01:44:27.417 --> 01:44:30.420
What point are you making?

01:45:00.868 --> 01:45:03.120
<i>Bonjour.</i>

01:45:08.876 --> 01:45:10.627
I think so.

01:45:12.713 --> 01:45:15.257
You sure you don't need more time?

01:45:15.382 --> 01:45:17.676
No, I know what I want.

01:45:17.759 --> 01:45:20.387
You're sure?

01:45:22.097 --> 01:45:24.850
Absolutely.

01:45:26.727 --> 01:45:30.689
So, what is it to be?

01:45:30.814 --> 01:45:34.109
How's the soup?

01:45:34.234 --> 01:45:36.862
The soup is finished.

01:45:36.945 --> 01:45:39.198
Like my job.

01:45:42.951 --> 01:45:44.203
The fish?

01:45:44.328 --> 01:45:47.039
We've run out.

01:45:47.164 --> 01:45:50.500
That's like me with excuses.

01:45:52.586 --> 01:45:53.921
Don't waste my time.

01:45:54.046 --> 01:45:55.881
Choose something we have.

01:45:59.259 --> 01:46:00.510
I would like a lifetime spent

01:46:00.594 --> 01:46:03.597
with an irrational
and suspicious goddess.

01:46:06.767 --> 01:46:09.770
Some short-tempered jealousy
on the side...

01:46:12.314 --> 01:46:15.567
...and a bottle of wine
that tastes like you...

01:46:15.651 --> 01:46:17.819
and a glass that's never empty.

01:46:40.217 --> 01:46:44.763
You remember what
I whispered to you

01:46:44.846 --> 01:46:47.933
when we were kids in the pool.

01:46:48.058 --> 01:46:50.686
And it seems that you do, too.

01:46:50.811 --> 01:46:53.230
<i>Bien sur.</i>

01:46:53.313 --> 01:46:56.275
But it was not
until just now

01:46:56.358 --> 01:47:01.363
that I recognized you: Max.

01:47:29.433 --> 01:47:31.310
I said no.

01:47:31.435 --> 01:47:32.477
What, "No, no, no, no."

01:47:32.603 --> 01:47:34.813
No way. You are not
de-stemming those grapes.

01:47:34.938 --> 01:47:36.148
But this is the way

01:47:36.231 --> 01:47:37.816
I've always done things, you know.

01:47:37.941 --> 01:47:39.860
We want structure
and color for the wine.

01:47:39.985 --> 01:47:42.446
Leaving the stems on
when we press will give it a kick in the ass.

01:47:42.571 --> 01:47:44.489
And the wine will taste like rocket fuel.

01:47:44.573 --> 01:47:45.616
No way!

01:47:45.741 --> 01:47:46.783
You are not de-stemming
those grapes.

01:47:46.867 --> 01:47:48.452
All acids and tannins.

01:47:48.535 --> 01:47:49.786
Oh, you say acid and tannins...

01:47:49.870 --> 01:47:50.829
Yes, I say tannins...

01:47:50.954 --> 01:47:52.831
I say flavor and cojones, you know,

01:47:52.956 --> 01:47:54.249
- Barolo super Tuscans.
- Whoa.

01:47:54.333 --> 01:47:55.209
That's what's selling out there.

01:47:55.334 --> 01:47:57.419
Not some wimpy wine from Louveron!

01:47:59.504 --> 01:48:01.632
Ah, Max.
Thank God you're here.

01:48:01.715 --> 01:48:04.676
<i>I will not work with this
mad person jamais! Never!</i>

01:48:06.136 --> 01:48:10.057
I love her, this woman, she...

01:48:10.182 --> 01:48:12.893
she's like Henry, with a nice ass.

01:48:15.312 --> 01:48:17.314
Oh...

01:48:17.397 --> 01:48:19.316
I can't deal with this guy, Max.

01:48:19.399 --> 01:48:23.779
What is it with the French?

01:48:23.862 --> 01:48:27.324
Oh, and, uh, by the way,

01:48:27.407 --> 01:48:28.825
you were running low
on green ink,

01:48:28.909 --> 01:48:30.702
so I bought you some more.

01:48:30.786 --> 01:48:33.830
- Never know.

01:48:33.956 --> 01:48:37.376
You might want to write
a letter or something.

01:48:41.880 --> 01:48:42.839
Yes?

01:48:42.965 --> 01:48:44.341
Max, how's Christie?

01:48:44.424 --> 01:48:47.010
How's the sale going, Charlie?

01:48:47.135 --> 01:48:48.387
Apartments in this bracket
shift in a blink.

01:48:48.512 --> 01:48:51.139
I'm very confident of getting
you more than you paid for it.

01:48:51.223 --> 01:48:52.266
Bullshit, Charlie.

01:48:52.391 --> 01:48:53.934
If you don't give me
a 40% yield,

01:48:54.059 --> 01:48:55.519
you're off the gig, Sunshine.
You got me?

01:48:56.853 --> 01:48:59.523
Max, you do realize, of course,

01:48:59.606 --> 01:49:01.441
it's not going to last
down there, don't you?

01:49:01.567 --> 01:49:03.068
You don't say.

01:49:03.193 --> 01:49:05.571
And as impossible
as it may seem,

01:49:05.654 --> 01:49:08.574
the very things that are
so unique and sexy now,

01:49:08.657 --> 01:49:12.077
will soon be the dread
of your day-to-day existence.

01:49:12.202 --> 01:49:14.830
And after a few months of eating

01:49:14.913 --> 01:49:17.666
and drinking and sleeping,

01:49:17.749 --> 01:49:21.295
and shagging, what have you got
to look forward to, huh?

01:49:21.420 --> 01:49:22.880
Boredom.

01:49:24.423 --> 01:49:28.176
I mean, what are you going
to do, write a book? Hmm?

01:49:29.595 --> 01:49:31.054
Max, I'm your best friend,

01:49:31.179 --> 01:49:33.181
and I'm telling you, you won't last.

01:49:33.265 --> 01:49:35.893
We'll see about that, Charlie.

01:49:35.976 --> 01:49:37.311
Okay, okay, okay.

01:49:37.436 --> 01:49:38.395
Like this, l-I...

01:49:50.699 --> 01:49:53.076
You know, that was Charlie
on the phone...

01:49:53.160 --> 01:49:54.119
Ah, no, no, no.

01:50:00.167 --> 01:50:01.543
<i>Un arbre.</i>

01:50:05.505 --> 01:50:06.590
<i>Oiseau.</i>

01:51:12.990 --> 01:51:15.909
So, uh, are you an actual rapper?

01:51:17.911 --> 01:51:19.788
No, he's the rapper.
I'm the manager.

01:51:21.164 --> 01:51:22.916
Mm.

01:51:24.334 --> 01:51:26.378
I'm Jasminda, by the way.

01:51:26.503 --> 01:51:27.754
Gemma for short.

01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:36.722
Bollocks!

01:51:56.658 --> 01:51:57.618
Oh.

01:52:09.171 --> 01:52:10.589
Shh.

01:52:35.239 --> 01:52:38.200
<i>- Viva La Armstrong!</i>

01:52:52.256 --> 01:52:53.298
- Be in touch.
