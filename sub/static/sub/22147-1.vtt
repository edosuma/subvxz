02:01.822 --> 02:02.756
Come on.

02:07.228 --> 02:09.530
Hey there. / Hey.

02:10.431 --> 02:14.802
Did I wake you? I'm sorry. /
That's okay, it's okay.

02:15.736 --> 02:16.737
What do you need?

02:17.771 --> 02:18.739
Are you in trouble?

02:19.607 --> 02:21.775
Nothing like that.

02:23.544 --> 02:27.948
It's just, it's my first, it's
my first night, that's all.

02:27.981 --> 02:32.753
Oh, that's right.
Is everything going okay?

02:34.755 --> 02:35.923
Sure.

02:37.258 --> 02:40.961
I'm a little nervous,
and I don't want to be.

02:40.994 --> 02:44.432
Did you, did you call your mom
like we talked about?

02:46.600 --> 02:52.406
She hasn't listened to a word
I've said since, since Jason.

02:55.309 --> 02:57.678
Do you have something on you now?

02:59.847 --> 03:02.850
Just some Xanax, nothing intense.

03:04.918 --> 03:06.654
You know what I think?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.923
I think that you should
throw those things away

03:09.957 --> 03:13.827
right now. You don't need them.

03:14.962 --> 03:18.499
You have worked so hard
for tonight, come on.

03:20.301 --> 03:22.436
Are you hearing me? Okay?

03:29.610 --> 03:32.012
I hear you. / Okay.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.914
I hear you. / Okay.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.318
Say the prayer with me, alright?

03:50.998 --> 03:54.835
Here in the glorious city of angels.

03:54.868 --> 03:57.305
Coming up later in the program,
I will shine my

03:57.338 --> 04:01.308
beacon of reality on
a massive clandestine

04:01.309 --> 04:04.478
operation that is
happening right here in

04:04.512 --> 04:06.747
our own backyard.

04:06.780 --> 04:09.417
So get ready for that
coming up shortly, but

04:09.450 --> 04:14.321
first, you know those long
stretches of factories and

04:14.322 --> 04:19.593
warehouses that sit empty,
untouched, essentially off

04:19.627 --> 04:21.028
the radar?

04:21.060 --> 04:25.833
You drive by them every day
without batting an eye, right?

04:25.866 --> 04:30.538
Well, I have some news for
you fellow truth seekers.

04:30.571 --> 04:35.743
Those are what I like to
call the nesting grounds,

04:35.776 --> 04:38.979
the hidden home bases,
this is where they will

04:39.012 --> 04:41.549
launch the attack that
will bring down this

04:41.582 --> 04:45.786
country in flame and ruin!

04:45.819 --> 04:49.357
They're not coming from
afar, they are right next

04:49.390 --> 04:53.361
to us, ready to wipe us
out from within, I'm going

04:53.394 --> 04:56.397
to tell you how to find
these hidden bases and

04:56.430 --> 05:01.802
when you do, let me know,
I will let the people know.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.920
And we're back live
from the info bunker.

05:19.953 --> 05:23.591
I promised you a major
exposÃ© on an operation

05:23.624 --> 05:28.662
happening right here
in LA, and here it is.

05:28.696 --> 05:31.932
I hope you're ready for it
because it's not pretty.

05:31.965 --> 05:34.735
Let's base jump right down
the rabbit hole, truth

05:34.768 --> 05:38.005
seekers, right now...

05:38.038 --> 05:41.542
Okay, so, yours has the cream, okay?

05:41.575 --> 05:43.877
Black, I take my coffee black.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.113
I thought you said cream and sugar?

05:46.146 --> 05:47.781
I thought you were listening?

05:48.982 --> 05:50.951
I was listening, just, it's that...

05:52.786 --> 05:54.021
Wow. / You know what?

05:54.855 --> 05:55.989
Now it doesn't matter.

05:57.124 --> 05:58.058
I'm sorry.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.594
I'll just go back and
get you another one.

06:00.628 --> 06:02.062
You know what, rookie?

06:02.095 --> 06:03.597
Don't worry about it.

06:03.631 --> 06:06.900
No it's no big deal... /
Park the coffee!

06:06.934 --> 06:08.836
Just get inside already.

06:19.447 --> 06:23.116
...society as we know it,
my sources tell me that

06:23.150 --> 06:26.520
these hidden agents are
genetically engineered

06:26.554 --> 06:31.158
soldiers, possibly mixed
with animal and alien DNA.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.794
And they are... /
Is that nutjob for real?

06:33.827 --> 06:35.496
Hundred fuckin' percent real.

06:35.529 --> 06:39.633
Now the crazy shit he's saying
is certainly up for debate.

06:39.667 --> 06:42.169
You believe in this stuff?

06:42.202 --> 06:45.806
What I believe is there is
seriously evil, fucked up

06:45.839 --> 06:47.975
things going on that most
of the population don't

06:48.008 --> 06:49.042
know about.

06:49.076 --> 06:51.679
And do you really need
a lunatic with a radio show

06:51.712 --> 06:52.980
to explain that to you?

06:53.013 --> 06:55.716
...government supplied
peace keepers. Police,

06:55.749 --> 06:58.586
National Guard, Animal Control,
et cetera, et cetera.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.153
What? / Et cetera!

07:00.187 --> 07:03.591
Just enjoying the smell of your coffee.

07:03.624 --> 07:06.059
That shit's freshly brewed, huh?

07:09.029 --> 07:10.898
I'm going back in and
I'm getting you another.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.700
Come on!

07:12.733 --> 07:15.102
No! / It was a joke, rookie!

07:21.942 --> 07:24.512
Seriously, forget the coffee,
get back in here!

07:29.750 --> 07:30.984
What the hell was that?

07:31.018 --> 07:34.021
Sounded like an explosion,
huge motherfucking

07:34.054 --> 07:37.658
explosion. Had to be close.

07:37.691 --> 07:41.261
Ambulance 12, ambulance 15,
ambulance 32,

07:41.294 --> 07:44.798
engine 3, engine 6, immediate
response required at 59th

07:44.832 --> 07:48.836
and Main, large explosion reported
at a manufacturing complex.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.804
Dispatch, ambulance 32, copy?

07:50.838 --> 07:54.107
Ambulance 32, respond to 59th
and Main immediately.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.076
Please move all radio
traffic for this incident

07:56.109 --> 07:59.780
to Channel 2. Dispatch clear at 0-1-4-2.

07:59.813 --> 08:01.849
Dispatch ambulance 32 en route.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.811
Watch the cross traffic, if
we get hit, it's your fault.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.914
Pay attention to dispatch,
you're gonna have to respond.

08:36.583 --> 08:37.951
Whoo-hoo!

08:38.686 --> 08:40.587
Last time I worked a major
fire it was some crazy ass

08:40.587 --> 08:42.990
meth lab that blew up,
found a bunch of half

08:43.023 --> 08:45.693
roasted junkies inside. The air,

08:45.726 --> 08:50.063
the air stunk like pork
overcooked on barbecue.

08:50.097 --> 08:51.732
Are you trying to freak me out?

08:51.765 --> 08:52.933
Are you freaked out?

08:52.966 --> 08:54.768
You're an EMT for fuck's sake.

08:54.802 --> 08:57.270
I'm just making sure you're prepared for

08:57.304 --> 08:59.039
whatever we're about to see.

09:04.712 --> 09:06.313
Wait, what are you doing?

09:06.346 --> 09:07.614
Shortcut.

09:07.615 --> 09:11.619
All hands on deck, must be
a huge fuckin' mess over there.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.954
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie watch out!

09:17.725 --> 09:19.026
They have the nukes!

09:20.060 --> 09:23.163
The quake will blow past
ten on the Richter scale!

09:24.064 --> 09:28.068
Must reach second position
before they do, before they do.

09:31.038 --> 09:32.840
Oh my god.

09:32.873 --> 09:34.041
Alright, it's show time.

09:35.976 --> 09:38.111
Let's go, let's do this. /
What about the explosion?

09:38.145 --> 09:40.914
I think our situation
has changed hasn't it?

09:40.948 --> 09:42.783
We're out here to help whoever needs it.

09:42.816 --> 09:46.687
Radio dispatch, unexpected PT, code 13!

09:46.720 --> 09:48.956
PT, code 13.

09:49.757 --> 09:51.391
Dispatch, ambulance 32! / Sir?

09:51.424 --> 09:53.060
Can you tell me your name, sir?

09:53.093 --> 09:55.228
Dispatch, ambulance 32!

09:57.130 --> 09:59.299
Get the board and the kit, rookie!

09:59.332 --> 10:00.934
The board and the kit, hurry up!

10:01.835 --> 10:03.236
Sir?

10:03.270 --> 10:05.706
How did this happen,
I need you to talk to me.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.911
My name is Eddie, that
over there is my partner

10:10.944 --> 10:12.144
Lauren, we're out here to help you.

10:12.145 --> 10:15.816
Gotta stop them... Please... /
Sir, I need you to stay

10:15.849 --> 10:17.617
down, I need you to remain calm.

10:20.287 --> 10:21.955
You have to help me.

10:21.989 --> 10:23.429
We might have a serious injury here.

10:24.357 --> 10:25.759
Rookie!

10:25.793 --> 10:27.360
I'm sorry.

10:27.394 --> 10:28.762
What have we got?

10:28.796 --> 10:30.229
Put pressure on his
shoulder there, we got

10:30.230 --> 10:32.733
some active bleeding.

10:32.766 --> 10:34.233
There's also a deformity
and a small lac on his

10:34.234 --> 10:35.969
inner right thigh.

10:36.003 --> 10:37.738
He's slipping in and
out of consciousness.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.072
Bullet wound?

10:39.106 --> 10:40.974
Let's get him inside,
we'll take a better look.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.410
Wait wait wait wait wait!

10:43.443 --> 10:44.411
Put a C collar on him.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.748
Right, of course, I'm sorry. /
Think, think!

10:59.326 --> 11:00.427
Roll him on 3.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.062
One, two, three!

11:08.135 --> 11:11.238
You radio dispatch? /
No, I couldn't get through.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.774
What the hell do you mean? /
I don't know, it was just like

11:13.807 --> 11:16.743
static, like some sort of... /
That doesn't even make sense.

11:16.744 --> 11:17.977
I don't know, I just
couldn't get through.

11:17.978 --> 11:19.913
Oxygen mask on him now!

11:23.116 --> 11:25.886
In ten years I've been
doing this, I've never lost

11:25.919 --> 11:27.821
touch with dispatch.

11:34.928 --> 11:37.064
Give me a four by four.

11:39.532 --> 11:42.169
I guess this guy was near
the explosion, got hit

11:42.202 --> 11:44.037
when a window blew out or something.

11:45.105 --> 11:46.940
Can you understand me, man?

11:46.974 --> 11:49.042
I'm gonna ask you a few
questions, did you take

11:49.076 --> 11:51.211
any drugs tonight, any alcohol?

11:51.244 --> 11:53.413
Do you know where you are? /
I need, I need...

11:56.884 --> 11:59.219
Oh, Jesus Christ.

11:59.252 --> 12:02.990
Turn his forearm around,
check for track marks.

12:03.023 --> 12:06.126
Sooner we know what he did,
sooner we can help him out.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.864
I need my arm.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.968
No punctures or bruises on his skin.

12:15.002 --> 12:17.905
You do know what track
marks look like right?

12:17.938 --> 12:20.941
I know a junkie when I see one, yes.

12:22.509 --> 12:25.345
You're going to be okay,
we're going to help you, okay?

12:26.947 --> 12:28.448
You'll be fine.

12:29.516 --> 12:32.152
Please, get back.

12:34.521 --> 12:36.189
What...?

12:37.825 --> 12:38.825
What is it?

12:38.826 --> 12:41.061
Looks like we got
a prosthetic on this side.

12:42.830 --> 12:44.998
And the dude's wearing dog tags.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.305
David Armstrong?

12:52.339 --> 12:54.307
We might have a vet on our hands.

12:55.108 --> 12:57.444
Sad what happens to
these guys these days.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.351
What is this?

13:04.384 --> 13:06.954
Look at this, Jesus.

13:08.388 --> 13:09.489
So strange.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.426
Whoa, whoa, whoa, partner,
slow down there.

13:13.460 --> 13:18.131
Please, please, get back,
please get back.

13:18.165 --> 13:21.234
We're not going anywhere man,
I need you to sit still.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.236
Sit still!

13:23.270 --> 13:24.971
Jesus Christ, this guy's
got some strength, hold his

13:24.972 --> 13:27.274
shoulder down, will you?

13:27.307 --> 13:28.876
I said sit still!

13:28.909 --> 13:30.310
I can't control it...

13:31.278 --> 13:33.113
Ah!

13:33.313 --> 13:34.481
Let go!

13:34.514 --> 13:36.516
Ah, fuck!

13:46.659 --> 13:48.228
Motherfu...

13:48.261 --> 13:49.930
I'm gonna need to splint this, give me a

13:49.963 --> 13:53.466
goddamn bandage.
Come on, give me a bandage!

13:55.602 --> 13:57.137
I got it.

13:59.139 --> 14:00.407
You need help?

14:04.244 --> 14:05.212
Fuck.

14:05.245 --> 14:07.214
Okay do it, you do it,
just don't fuck it up.

14:09.249 --> 14:10.483
The explosion...

14:11.618 --> 14:13.420
What kind of prosthetic is that?

14:13.453 --> 14:15.989
Grip like a goddamn vice.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.190
You have to help me...

14:21.694 --> 14:24.264
Hey, hey, hey! Get that oxygen mask on!

14:26.166 --> 14:29.536
Still getting residual
power fluctuations.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.238
Difficult to control.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.942
Alright, we're both
definitely riding up front.

14:34.975 --> 14:37.210
What about him?

14:37.244 --> 14:39.046
Well, we stopped his bleeding.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.712
And I'm not putting us
in harm's way anymore.

14:40.713 --> 14:43.650
We'll just drive him to the ER
and let them deal with

14:43.683 --> 14:47.020
whoever the fuck he is.

14:53.093 --> 14:55.128
Alright, let's go.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.105
You want me to drive?

15:05.138 --> 15:07.274
If both my hands were broken and I were

15:07.307 --> 15:11.511
blindfolded I could drive
this piece of shit to the hospital.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.280
Understood.

15:43.110 --> 15:44.743
You see, I'm telling you,
it's been like that ever

15:44.744 --> 15:46.646
since we picked him up.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.680
Maybe it's a power surge, or
some sort of interference caused

15:48.681 --> 15:50.383
by the explosion.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.189
No service on this either.

15:56.223 --> 15:58.658
Okay, okay.

15:58.691 --> 16:01.261
Just forget the ER, we're
taking him to the cops.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.433
What was that? / I don't know.

16:41.501 --> 16:43.136
Jesus Christ.

16:51.411 --> 16:55.348
Must gain control of
the distress beacon.

16:55.382 --> 17:00.653
Don't want them to find us,
can't have them find us.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.389
Help me!

17:02.422 --> 17:04.590
No no no, don't go near him!

17:07.594 --> 17:09.762
Hey, you break shit,
you pay for it buddy!

17:16.203 --> 17:18.471
Distress signal terminated.

17:18.505 --> 17:19.339
It's not too late.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.310
What the hell does he have under there?

17:24.344 --> 17:25.743
It doesn't matter, rookie,
I'm throwing him out of

17:25.744 --> 17:29.616
my ambulance.
He's clearly a danger to us!

17:29.649 --> 17:32.319
We call the cops, when we
get service and we let

17:32.352 --> 17:33.653
them handle it.

17:33.686 --> 17:35.822
Just stay away from him.

17:42.595 --> 17:45.798
Due to the damage to
my modular interface, it's

17:45.832 --> 17:48.468
impossible to override
the signal quickly.

17:49.736 --> 17:53.773
The Harbingers! It may be too late.

17:53.806 --> 17:55.507
I'm sorry but I don't know
what you're saying...

17:55.508 --> 17:57.477
It may be too late!

17:57.510 --> 17:58.711
I'll do anything you say.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.749
My wallet is in my back
pocket, got drugs in

18:02.782 --> 18:06.719
the ambulance, just, just uh,
just take whatever you need.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.288
Get down.

18:08.321 --> 18:11.524
Just don't hurt anyone man, okay?

18:11.558 --> 18:14.394
Don't move. / Shit.

18:17.630 --> 18:19.299
Put your hands behind your back.

18:22.402 --> 18:25.205
Ah! Ow, ow!

18:25.238 --> 18:27.474
Where's the man you picked up?

18:27.507 --> 18:30.243
What? What are you talking about?

18:30.277 --> 18:31.778
Some crazy man with a gun.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.680
The man with the arm.

18:33.713 --> 18:35.415
He's in the truck, he's in the back.

18:43.856 --> 18:46.793
Did he say anything to
you about his mission?

18:46.826 --> 18:48.395
No. He was unconscious!

18:50.897 --> 18:52.899
Did he tell you where he was going?

18:52.932 --> 18:54.867
No, he was unconscious!

18:55.768 --> 18:57.637
Look man, I don't know
anything, I'm an EMT!

18:57.670 --> 19:00.206
You will die on the road
in a puddle of your own...

19:00.207 --> 19:01.641
What are you doing?

19:11.351 --> 19:13.720
If you don't answer me, I will kill you.

19:25.632 --> 19:26.866
Freeze!

19:26.899 --> 19:29.369
I don't see nothing, I
don't see nothing, man!

19:31.938 --> 19:35.675
Jesus! Oh god, oh please, look, I'll do

19:35.708 --> 19:37.344
anything you want, please? / Shit.

19:54.026 --> 19:55.928
Tell your partner to get out
of the ambulance.

19:55.962 --> 19:57.964
Stay back, I can help.

19:57.997 --> 20:00.300
Hey man, she doesn't know
any more than I do!

20:00.333 --> 20:02.033
If you don't tell her
to get out here, I'm going

20:02.034 --> 20:04.237
to have to go in after her, and neither

20:04.271 --> 20:05.772
of you are going to like that.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.241
You keep asking me the same
questions, I don't know.

20:08.275 --> 20:09.376
Do you know why you're

20:09.409 --> 20:11.278
on the ground in front of me?

20:11.311 --> 20:13.346
That man in your ambulance
is on a dangerous path

20:13.380 --> 20:15.615
which will erase years of progress.

20:15.648 --> 20:18.451
Man, I don't know! / The earth will be

20:18.485 --> 20:20.453
reborn and you can choose
to be a part of it

20:20.487 --> 20:21.988
or end up like the rest!

20:22.021 --> 20:23.956
Oh god, please, please, don't,

20:23.990 --> 20:25.958
Look, please, I don't,
I'll do anything you want.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.793
We will crack the earth
and release the fire that

20:27.794 --> 20:29.429
will burn everything... Ah!

20:32.832 --> 20:34.901
You can't stop the destiny
that is planned for all

20:34.934 --> 20:39.806
of us! We will be reborn in
the fires of the Fifth Sun...

20:47.514 --> 20:48.915
What the hell is that thing?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.618
Wait, wait, don't touch
me, don't touch me... ow!

20:54.721 --> 20:56.356
You're not human.

20:58.057 --> 20:59.492
Are you okay?

20:59.526 --> 21:01.661
Yes. / Okay.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.865
My god, what the hell?

21:16.343 --> 21:18.077
Hey what are you doing?

21:18.110 --> 21:19.745
The cops won't want you
messing with whatever's

21:19.746 --> 21:20.980
left there.

21:21.013 --> 21:22.849
I'm not calling the cops.

21:29.756 --> 21:30.790
Who the hell are you?

21:30.823 --> 21:32.559
The less you know about me, the better.

21:32.592 --> 21:35.928
What's going on?
Why was that guy after you?

21:35.962 --> 21:37.630
Because I'm getting in their way.

21:37.664 --> 21:38.531
Whose way?

21:51.411 --> 21:56.416
Grant me the serenity
to accept the things that

21:56.449 --> 22:03.523
I cannot change, the courage to
change the things that I can,

22:03.556 --> 22:06.092
And the wisdom to know the difference.

22:06.125 --> 22:09.529
Hey! Get in, we're leaving, now!

22:11.864 --> 22:14.066
Oh my god.

22:26.646 --> 22:27.947
What about him?

22:29.782 --> 22:32.084
I think doctor claw is
going to be just fine.

22:33.553 --> 22:36.422
Eddie, I don't know what's going on, but

22:36.423 --> 22:38.525
he did just save our lives. /
Maybe you just better

22:38.558 --> 22:42.562
shut your mouth, and let
me get us out of here!

22:45.064 --> 22:47.834
He just vaporized someone,
he doesn't need us!

22:47.867 --> 22:50.169
You're wrong!

22:50.202 --> 22:54.073
I do need your help, both of you.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.941
And I need this ambulance
to get us away from here

22:55.942 --> 22:57.710
as quickly as possible.

22:57.744 --> 23:00.813
Look, we did our best
to fix you up, alright?

23:00.847 --> 23:02.014
We've done our job.

23:02.048 --> 23:05.618
You're gonna drive us, and
you're gonna drive us now.

23:05.652 --> 23:07.085
We don't want to be
involved with whatever

23:07.086 --> 23:08.154
you're messed up in.

23:08.187 --> 23:09.756
You're already involved because you

23:09.789 --> 23:11.691
saw what just happened.

23:11.724 --> 23:13.592
That Harbinger radioed in
that I was picked up by

23:13.593 --> 23:15.728
paramedics, they're looking for you now!

23:15.762 --> 23:18.565
Now stop wasting time and start driving!

23:21.133 --> 23:24.471
Staying with me right now is the
only way I can keep you safe.

23:37.517 --> 23:39.652
What are you waiting for? Let's go!

23:46.559 --> 23:48.861
Now you're fucking throwing
out our equipment??

23:51.230 --> 23:53.499
Great.

23:53.500 --> 23:54.667
Just great.

24:46.619 --> 24:48.621
The hell do you think it is?

24:48.655 --> 24:51.123
I don't give a shit, just
look at my finger, okay? Look!

25:00.733 --> 25:02.602
Dispatch ambulance 32!

25:05.204 --> 25:07.073
Dispatch ambulance 32!

25:15.214 --> 25:16.949
Where the hell are we going?

25:16.983 --> 25:18.585
Just drive.

25:45.812 --> 25:47.212
Have either of you been
communicating with anyone

25:47.213 --> 25:48.681
since you found me?

25:48.715 --> 25:51.651
No, we haven't been able to,
it's just static.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.052
Why does it matter?

25:53.085 --> 25:54.753
Because they have advanced
DCN that allows them to

25:54.754 --> 25:57.657
scramble and hack into
local electronics.

25:57.690 --> 25:59.257
Now that they know my
location, they can use it

25:59.258 --> 26:00.760
to track me down.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.796
What about cell phones?

26:03.830 --> 26:04.864
Very possible.

26:06.298 --> 26:08.000
In fact, hand them over.

26:12.304 --> 26:15.274
You have one too? /
I'm not giving it to you.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.744
We need to take every
measure to stay off the radar.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.245
Just let him take out the battery so

26:19.278 --> 26:21.379
then it becomes untraceable. /
Jesus, who are you taking

26:21.380 --> 26:24.651
orders from, rookie? Don't
touch... you mother...

26:32.659 --> 26:33.760
What was that?

26:33.793 --> 26:37.163
Electromagnetic pulse disabling
your phones completely.

26:37.196 --> 26:39.131
Just removing the batteries, huh?

26:39.899 --> 26:42.201
No dispatch, no cell phone,
no way to call for

26:42.234 --> 26:45.004
fuckin' help, it's perfect.
It's just perfect.

26:47.306 --> 26:50.076
Here. Pull left under this bridge,
put it in park.

26:50.109 --> 26:52.378
Nothing good ever happens
under a fucking bridge.

27:00.152 --> 27:01.320
Kill the lights.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.191
Okay you know, you know what?

27:05.224 --> 27:07.694
You're not telling me
what to do anymore.

27:08.795 --> 27:09.762
This is my vehicle,

27:09.796 --> 27:11.429
I'm in command,
and I need you out of here.

27:11.430 --> 27:12.698
Eddie, I just think
you should calm down.

27:12.699 --> 27:15.234
Rookie, I don't care what you think.
I want this guy gone!

27:15.267 --> 27:17.036
I just think you're making a mistake.

27:17.069 --> 27:20.072
Are you listening to me, buddy? What?

27:22.108 --> 27:23.375
You're right.

27:23.409 --> 27:26.178
It's your ambulance, you're in charge.

27:26.212 --> 27:29.849
Yeah. I'm in charge.
That's right.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.317
Now get out. Come on!

27:33.419 --> 27:35.888
Thank you for picking me up,
thank you for your help.

27:35.922 --> 27:36.889
Wait!

27:36.923 --> 27:38.725
Wait!

27:38.758 --> 27:41.293
What if we see another
one of those soldiers?

27:41.327 --> 27:43.362
If you see them,
hope they don't see you.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.196
It's not gonna happen,
rookie, because we're gonna

27:45.197 --> 27:46.966
go to the cops.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.135
Be careful! / You know what?

27:49.168 --> 27:51.102
When we picked him up,
you told me that we were out

27:51.103 --> 27:53.172
here to help whoever needs it.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.040
You didn't just have your
hands tied behind your

27:55.041 --> 27:57.176
back with some military
grade weaponry about to

27:57.209 --> 27:58.778
blow your brains out.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.811
You have no idea what it's
like to be that close to

28:00.813 --> 28:02.248
fucking dying, you hear me?

28:04.316 --> 28:07.219
Clearly you don't know
a god damn thing about me.

28:10.522 --> 28:13.459
Hey, maybe, maybe we should
get away from the window.

28:47.059 --> 28:48.795
Maybe it was just LAPD.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.964
I have a feeling that it wasn't.

28:51.998 --> 28:54.800
Okay, keep it together.

28:54.801 --> 28:58.871
We should have never let him go.

28:58.905 --> 29:00.973
I'll drive us out of here,
get us home as fast as we

29:01.007 --> 29:05.044
can, and then this night will be over.

29:05.077 --> 29:06.478
Okay.

29:06.512 --> 29:08.014
Fine.

29:17.489 --> 29:20.492
Stay down, stay down, stay down!

29:45.384 --> 29:47.286
Oh, shit!

29:59.431 --> 30:01.167
Weren't there three of them?

30:11.610 --> 30:14.180
How many Harbingers have been deployed?

30:14.213 --> 30:15.381
A full company.

30:15.414 --> 30:16.448
Bullshit!

30:16.482 --> 30:18.584
There isn't a full company
on the western seaboard.

30:18.617 --> 30:20.052
Can't be more than a dozen!

30:20.086 --> 30:21.566
More than enough to take care of you!

30:23.422 --> 30:25.323
What kind of security is at
the last two drill sites?

30:25.324 --> 30:27.093
I won't tell you anything!

30:29.228 --> 30:32.398
You can't stop the destiny
that is planned for all of us!

30:34.533 --> 30:36.635
How can you survive without
us when you need our

30:36.668 --> 30:40.039
power to keep you going? /
I've managed so far.

30:40.072 --> 30:42.441
You're a traitor, I can't imagine

30:42.474 --> 30:44.576
the fate that awaits you.

30:44.610 --> 30:45.743
They'll take that weapon back, and rip

30:45.744 --> 30:48.347
whatever's left of you to pieces,
and the rest of us

30:48.380 --> 30:51.583
will embark on the journey
of salvation that is

30:51.617 --> 30:52.985
already in motion!

30:53.019 --> 30:54.220
Ugh!

30:54.253 --> 30:58.524
You're alone. You simply can't
fight an army alone... Ungh!

31:03.695 --> 31:04.931
Watch out!

31:10.970 --> 31:13.472
The man you are helping is not stable!

31:13.505 --> 31:15.507
He escaped several months
ago from our care.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.610
We are trying to stop him
from causing any more

31:18.644 --> 31:20.679
destruction than he already has.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.681
He was blowing up buildings,
and he killed

31:22.714 --> 31:25.217
innocent people in the process.

31:25.251 --> 31:28.154
He is manipulating you!

31:28.187 --> 31:30.622
Has he allowed you to call for backup?

31:30.656 --> 31:34.460
For help? Probably not.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.628
There's a reason for that,
don't you think?

31:36.662 --> 31:38.964
We need him back under our care.

31:38.965 --> 31:41.667
Who do you think caused that
explosion tonight that wiped

31:41.700 --> 31:43.035
out an entire warehouse...

31:49.141 --> 31:51.010
He wasn't telling the truth.

31:52.278 --> 31:53.980
You gotta believe me.

32:06.625 --> 32:08.327
Who are they?

32:10.429 --> 32:12.298
They're called Harbingers.

32:12.331 --> 32:14.265
Front line shock troops
for an organization called

32:14.266 --> 32:15.367
the Fifth Sun.

32:15.401 --> 32:16.435
Are you one of them?

32:16.468 --> 32:19.238
I was, but I wasn't one of
the rank and file, I was

32:19.271 --> 32:20.472
one of their experiments.

32:20.506 --> 32:21.606
And what did he mean when he said that

32:21.607 --> 32:24.110
you were the one who caused
the explosion tonight?

32:24.143 --> 32:27.313
Look, you have to
understand that absolutely

32:27.346 --> 32:29.681
no civilians were killed.

32:29.715 --> 32:33.185
I did extensive recon of
the area before detonating.

32:33.219 --> 32:35.120
There were six fatalities,
but they were all verified

32:35.121 --> 32:36.555
members of the Fifth Sun.

32:36.588 --> 32:39.491
Jesus, we're fucking fools.

32:39.525 --> 32:41.527
You hear this shit?
The dead guy was right.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.793
We've been helping a fucking terrorist.

32:42.794 --> 32:45.164
Eddie, just let him explain. /
No, he blew up a building,

32:45.197 --> 32:46.632
and we helped him escape!

32:47.166 --> 32:48.434
Ow, ow!

32:48.467 --> 32:50.135
Look, I can help. /
Get that fucking thing

32:50.136 --> 32:51.537
away from me.

32:51.570 --> 32:54.440
I can help you with
the pain! /  I'm fine.

32:54.473 --> 32:57.043
When you found me, I was
semiconscious, I didn't

32:57.076 --> 32:59.111
have control of my system's
power fluctuations.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.379
No shit.

33:02.814 --> 33:04.516
This is an advanced amino ammine.

33:04.550 --> 33:06.518
It's administered with a gem injector.

33:06.552 --> 33:11.057
It's perfectly safe, will
immediately help with the pain.

33:19.365 --> 33:22.668
Eddie, you have to trust
me, I can help you.

33:22.701 --> 33:24.070
I'm not a terrorist.

33:32.144 --> 33:39.551
Ahhh, I don't know what to
think anymore. Just, whatever.

33:51.397 --> 33:53.199
Just tell us what's happening.

33:53.232 --> 33:55.401
The Fifth Sun are trying
to kill a lot of people,

33:55.434 --> 33:57.536
on a massive scale and
I'm trying to stop them.

33:57.569 --> 33:59.771
They're a very widespread,
well organized, extremely

33:59.805 --> 34:02.141
well funded doomsday cult.

34:02.174 --> 34:04.710
They believe the world must end
with cataclysmic earthquakes.

34:04.743 --> 34:07.112
Wait, I've heard of
this shit before. You're

34:07.113 --> 34:09.547
talking about some sort of
Aztec beliefs aren't you?

34:09.581 --> 34:11.248
And here you thought I was
wasting my time listening

34:11.250 --> 34:12.684
to that radio whack-job.

34:12.717 --> 34:15.221
It's the same shit he's talking about!

34:15.254 --> 34:18.657
Aztecs, they believe each
sun represents, like, a

34:18.690 --> 34:19.858
cycle of the earth.

34:19.891 --> 34:22.161
Creation and destruction.

34:22.194 --> 34:23.828
The Fifth Sun believes
that if they can control

34:23.829 --> 34:25.764
the destruction of our
planet that they'll be

34:25.797 --> 34:26.965
the only ones who are saved.

34:26.998 --> 34:30.302
How do I know you're not just
some tin foiled hat psycho

34:30.335 --> 34:32.237
who listens to the same nut I do?

34:33.304 --> 34:35.440
This thing look like it's
made out of tinfoil?

34:35.474 --> 34:38.577
So they're starting the end of days?

34:38.610 --> 34:40.378
They've used their immense
resources to acquire

34:40.379 --> 34:42.347
high-yield nukes that they
are going to drop at fault

34:42.348 --> 34:43.882
lines all over the world.

34:43.915 --> 34:47.886
And I'm talking about
massive destruction.

34:47.918 --> 34:51.157
Wiping out hundreds of
thousands... millions of people.

34:51.190 --> 34:55.393
And they're starting right
here in Los Angeles. Tonight.

34:59.831 --> 35:00.931
There's two more sites in the city

35:00.932 --> 35:02.401
that will detonate at dawn.

35:05.804 --> 35:07.484
Now do you understand
why I need your help?

35:16.715 --> 35:19.418
We've been stationary too long.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.719
We need to go.

35:21.487 --> 35:23.289
Woah, woah, woah.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.594
This is bat shit, crazy.

35:28.627 --> 35:29.595
What if he's right?

35:29.628 --> 35:31.362
I mean, the city's gonna
get wiped out, all these

35:31.363 --> 35:32.898
people are gonna die.

35:33.899 --> 35:37.503
Agh, you're right. Ugh.

35:39.205 --> 35:40.806
You realize how much heat I'm gonna

35:40.839 --> 35:43.209
get when I turn this
goddamn ambulance in.

36:15.807 --> 36:18.844
Take the next left. Keep going.

36:25.251 --> 36:26.352
So tell me something.

36:27.353 --> 36:29.288
How did you get involved
with this Fifth Sun shit

36:29.321 --> 36:31.457
in the first place?

36:31.490 --> 36:33.625
I was a typical military vet.

36:33.659 --> 36:39.264
No family, no close
connections. No future.

36:39.265 --> 36:40.931
They were good at
recruiting, gave me a job,

36:40.932 --> 36:43.335
brought me into their cause.

36:45.504 --> 36:47.973
But the more I found out about
the cause, what I was being

36:48.006 --> 36:52.744
used for, the more I needed to escape.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.351
What are those things?

36:59.385 --> 37:01.687
They're electronically
hardened detonators.

37:01.720 --> 37:04.556
I stole them when I got
away, they'll allow me to

37:04.590 --> 37:07.826
destroy the drill sites
without disturbing the faults.

37:07.859 --> 37:10.696
The Fifth Sun won't be
able to compromise them

37:10.729 --> 37:12.498
once I've started the countdown.

37:13.699 --> 37:16.535
And what if you don't get
the site sealed in time?

37:16.568 --> 37:18.035
The Fifth Sun will set
off the nukes and the

37:18.036 --> 37:19.705
earthquakes will begin.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.009
Slow down.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.515
This is the second drill site.

37:29.548 --> 37:30.649
Pull over here.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.831
Wait for me at the bottom
floor of that parking garage.

37:45.864 --> 37:48.066
I've set the explosives
to trigger in fifteen minutes.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.468
I'll be back in ten.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.771
No radio communication.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.380
You're welcome!

38:26.972 --> 38:30.375
So, how are you liking
your first day on the job?

38:36.948 --> 38:38.817
When they told me that
I would be working the

38:38.850 --> 38:41.587
graveyard shift, they said
I would be so bored, but

38:41.620 --> 38:43.021
never expected anything

38:43.054 --> 38:45.824
this dull... yeah.

38:59.538 --> 39:02.140
So, how did you get into
EMT work and get stuck

39:02.173 --> 39:03.709
with this shift?

39:07.879 --> 39:10.716
Well, I wasn't too focused
on the right things when I

39:10.749 --> 39:16.822
was young, got myself into
trouble whenever I could.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.692
So when I got my act together this was

39:20.726 --> 39:25.631
something I could do to
pay child support and pay

39:25.664 --> 39:30.101
my ex, buy my kid an ice cream
once in a while, you know?

39:32.504 --> 39:33.505
Not to mention,

39:35.807 --> 39:39.778
far less people to piss
me off during these hours.

39:39.811 --> 39:41.012
Hmm.

39:55.160 --> 39:56.962
What's with that tattoo?

39:58.864 --> 40:00.899
My older brother Jason.

40:04.570 --> 40:06.572
I followed him everywhere.

40:08.507 --> 40:10.709
Did whatever he wanted to do.

40:16.948 --> 40:18.750
That's the problem
following someone who has

40:18.784 --> 40:22.087
completely lost their way.

40:24.956 --> 40:26.057
Know what I mean?

40:30.128 --> 40:33.932
First it was the
drinking, then the drugs.

40:38.537 --> 40:47.045
Then one night, we came home
and I passed out on the couch.

40:51.717 --> 40:58.724
When I woke, he was in,
he was in the living room.

41:05.964 --> 41:08.534
He wasn't breathing.

41:15.941 --> 41:19.044
I didn't know what to do.

41:19.077 --> 41:20.746
I was frozen.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.251
I get it.

41:29.621 --> 41:32.991
May 4th, 2009.

41:38.029 --> 41:40.566
That's the day I found him.

41:44.836 --> 41:47.873
Then I vowed to turn myself around.

41:49.708 --> 41:51.810
Get clean.

42:05.857 --> 42:08.960
I should have called an
ambulance the second I

42:08.994 --> 42:19.037
found him. But I didn't call.

42:23.174 --> 42:30.816
And if a paramedic, if
a paramedic had been there...

42:59.077 --> 43:03.649
One of these days I'm gonna
break free of these fuckers.

43:10.822 --> 43:12.157
Eh?

43:12.190 --> 43:18.396
Mm-mm. Nuh uh. I quit. Few years back.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.931
You sure?

43:19.965 --> 43:21.867
Mm-hm.

43:24.302 --> 43:26.838
Well, then I won't bother
you with the memories.

44:15.721 --> 44:17.022
Say the prayer with me.

44:28.099 --> 44:30.068
Say the prayer with me.

44:38.243 --> 44:40.011
Say the prayer with me.

44:41.980 --> 44:43.481
Grant me the serenity...

44:45.416 --> 44:47.919
to accept the things I cannot change.

44:50.355 --> 44:51.823
Say the prayer with me.

45:16.514 --> 45:18.316
Don't do it, rook.

45:21.853 --> 45:23.889
Why don't you just lay off?

45:23.922 --> 45:25.824
A lot of things have
happened tonight and I'm

45:25.857 --> 45:28.326
holding myself together pretty good.

45:30.228 --> 45:31.929
I don't know why people
don't think I can't keep

45:31.930 --> 45:34.365
my shit together! /
Hey hey, slow down partner,

45:34.399 --> 45:35.967
don't blame me for however

45:36.001 --> 45:37.368
you've been treated in your life.

45:37.402 --> 45:39.370
I'm just looking out
for you, you got it?

45:39.404 --> 45:41.339
You don't need it! /
I can figure out what I

45:41.372 --> 45:44.142
need exactly on my own.

45:46.111 --> 45:48.179
You know, I've been doing
this for a long time and

45:48.213 --> 45:50.148
I've worked with a lot of newbies.

45:50.181 --> 45:52.517
You actually have a brain
in your head, you're

45:52.550 --> 45:54.519
just too scared to use it!

45:55.854 --> 45:57.522
I just finished telling
you what I've been

45:57.555 --> 46:00.992
through, and you're gonna
give me a hard time?

46:01.026 --> 46:03.862
Have you looked at yourself
in the mirror lately?

46:03.895 --> 46:07.098
At least I'm not a bitter,
selfish son of a bitch!

46:17.575 --> 46:22.447
The last thing I want you to
do is compare yourself to me.

46:27.218 --> 46:29.520
Trust me on that one, alright?

46:29.554 --> 46:30.355
Eddie...!

46:39.430 --> 46:43.101
Eddie! Eddie, come on respond
to me, Eddie, come on, Eddie.

46:43.134 --> 46:44.335
Ah!

47:51.536 --> 47:53.138
Son of a bitch...

48:07.418 --> 48:08.586
...Ungh...

48:11.722 --> 48:13.959
Oh my god...

48:56.567 --> 48:59.504
You can't stop the destiny
that's planned for all of us.

49:03.608 --> 49:05.276
Stop it.

49:05.310 --> 49:09.447
You just killed my partner
and he didn't do anything.

49:09.480 --> 49:11.716
The plan has been set in motion.

49:11.749 --> 49:14.452
We will be reborn in the new age.

49:14.485 --> 49:17.155
Surrender your passenger.

49:17.188 --> 49:19.090
You won't survive.

49:19.124 --> 49:20.558
He is helpless.

49:20.591 --> 49:22.560
Alone.

49:22.593 --> 49:25.030
And what makes you
think that he's alone?

49:27.232 --> 49:28.666
You can't...

50:15.180 --> 50:16.381
Oh yeah.

50:30.195 --> 50:31.696
It's me!

50:31.729 --> 50:33.164
It's just me.

50:38.503 --> 50:39.704
What happened?

50:40.471 --> 50:41.606
Eddie's dead.

50:43.374 --> 50:45.110
She killed him.

50:48.879 --> 50:50.215
We were helping you.

50:51.349 --> 50:53.518
You said you'd protect us.

50:55.120 --> 50:56.621
I'm sorry.

51:02.327 --> 51:04.362
I'm supposed to be helping people.

51:04.395 --> 51:07.131
This is a mistake on my part, I
did not want this to happen.

51:07.132 --> 51:10.301
Eddie's dead because of
what you got us into.

51:10.335 --> 51:11.802
Do you get that?

51:11.836 --> 51:13.538
He was right.

51:13.571 --> 51:15.852
We should have just called the
police and left you behind!

51:15.873 --> 51:18.243
Stop it!

51:18.276 --> 51:20.678
Alright listen to me!

51:20.711 --> 51:22.447
When I found out about
their plans for Los

51:22.480 --> 51:25.883
Angeles I had very little time to act.

51:25.916 --> 51:28.519
I did everything I
possibly could to prepare.

51:28.553 --> 51:32.323
Maybe it wasn't the perfect
plan, but I had to do something!

51:33.391 --> 51:36.661
Do you understand that if
their plans proceed, too

51:36.694 --> 51:38.529
many people will die?

51:38.563 --> 51:40.298
Not just here, but all over the world?

51:40.331 --> 51:41.532
This is just the beginning!

51:44.502 --> 51:47.505
I'm fighting them the
best that I know how.

51:48.173 --> 51:51.376
Well so far it doesn't seem like
you're doing too well, right?

51:54.812 --> 52:00.751
Armstrong, I watched
you zap a man to dust.

52:00.785 --> 52:06.391
If you can do that, you should
never be on the losing side.

52:06.424 --> 52:09.660
When I escaped, I took
whatever was available to me.

52:09.694 --> 52:11.762
And this weapon requires
the utmost power and

52:11.796 --> 52:14.932
maintenance, and it's not
equipped to capacity!

52:14.965 --> 52:18.836
I've never had to fight a
battle like this before.

52:21.906 --> 52:23.874
I'm sorry.

52:43.828 --> 52:45.263
We're moving up the timetable,

52:45.296 --> 52:47.232
prepare for detonation.

52:47.265 --> 52:49.500
Code 1 is on site and responsible.

52:49.534 --> 52:50.968
What is it?

52:51.001 --> 52:52.236
...No longer viable.

52:52.237 --> 52:54.239
Lethal force request that
we set Richter 5 on

52:54.272 --> 52:56.274
intercept routes around
location Charlie and

52:56.307 --> 52:57.375
secure the perimeter.

52:57.408 --> 52:59.877
What's Richter 5? /
The helicopter from earlier.

52:59.910 --> 53:02.347
And Location Charlie? /
The final drill site.

53:02.380 --> 53:03.881
Repeat, set Richter 5 on...

53:03.914 --> 53:07.252
We should go, come on, we gotta go.

53:23.601 --> 53:24.635
Where are we going?

53:26.837 --> 53:28.473
It's on the other side of the river.

53:43.020 --> 53:44.389
What's this?

53:49.560 --> 53:50.995
A mistake.

53:51.896 --> 53:56.867
Tonight, all of this is...

53:56.901 --> 53:58.369
It's been a lot to deal with.

54:01.506 --> 54:02.840
So I slipped.

54:05.810 --> 54:08.379
I can't do it anymore.

54:08.413 --> 54:12.783
I won't ever ever do it again.

54:14.419 --> 54:15.886
That's a promise.

54:16.821 --> 54:19.824
Sounds like a promise too big to keep.

54:19.857 --> 54:22.327
There's nothing wrong with
taking it one day at a time.

54:23.561 --> 54:24.528
Maybe that's the problem.

54:24.529 --> 54:28.833
If you take it one day
at a time you can't,

54:28.866 --> 54:30.835
you can't prepare for the future.

54:38.543 --> 54:41.612
I never would have escaped
if I thought that far ahead.

54:41.646 --> 54:43.448
If I knew what I was up against.

54:45.516 --> 54:46.983
You know what I did
these last few months?

54:46.984 --> 54:48.886
I focused on the task at hand.

54:48.919 --> 54:51.889
Taking out the bad guys
as they got in my way.

54:51.922 --> 54:54.492
And that approach has kept me alive.

54:54.525 --> 54:56.394
Trying to stay alive.

54:56.427 --> 54:57.628
Is that all you're doing?

54:57.662 --> 54:59.430
As long as I stay alive
I can make sure other

54:59.464 --> 55:01.932
people don't die.

55:01.966 --> 55:02.900
Right.

55:04.502 --> 55:10.475
Maybe it's time for
something else. A plan.

55:10.508 --> 55:13.878
I told you I didn't have a lot of time.

55:13.911 --> 55:16.547
I had two weeks of
training with this thing,

55:16.581 --> 55:18.147
and that was in a
controlled environment.

55:18.148 --> 55:20.485
I'm learning as I go,
I make a mistake, I try not

55:20.518 --> 55:21.619
to repeat it.

55:25.523 --> 55:27.492
Your mistakes cost lives.

55:30.060 --> 55:32.062
I know that.

55:32.096 --> 55:34.865
Like I said, I'm doing the best I can.

55:38.469 --> 55:41.672
We can't let them get away
with what they did to Eddie.

55:41.706 --> 55:43.674
You have to at least promise me that.

55:50.080 --> 55:52.883
Good.

56:18.976 --> 56:20.611
They've found us!

56:29.854 --> 56:31.489
Oh shit.

56:33.858 --> 56:35.159
What should I do?

56:35.192 --> 56:37.628
Keep driving, don't slow down!

56:44.068 --> 56:45.169
Go faster!

56:48.539 --> 56:49.707
Faster!

56:53.844 --> 56:55.880
I'm gonna try and take it out.

56:59.016 --> 57:01.919
They open fire, change
direction as much as possible.

57:17.735 --> 57:19.136
Ah!

57:20.237 --> 57:21.071
Oh, shit!

57:31.882 --> 57:32.950
Here it comes!

57:42.893 --> 57:44.061
We can't outrun it!

57:58.075 --> 57:59.243
Faster!

58:02.246 --> 58:03.781
What are you doing??

58:03.814 --> 58:05.082
Shortcut!

58:11.756 --> 58:13.090
Do you see it?

58:13.123 --> 58:15.159
No! Keep driving!

58:36.647 --> 58:38.082
I'm running low on power.

58:38.115 --> 58:40.785
Only have a few shots left
before I have to reload.

58:40.818 --> 58:42.887
Here it comes again!

58:51.161 --> 58:52.229
Go faster!

58:58.335 --> 58:59.937
Are you hit??

59:00.738 --> 59:02.907
Armstrong, talk to me, are you hit??

59:21.191 --> 59:22.693
No!

59:27.131 --> 59:28.933
I lost my battery,

59:28.966 --> 59:31.168
I can't fire. / Shit.

59:32.837 --> 59:33.838
Don't stop!

59:37.141 --> 59:38.208
Here.

59:56.360 --> 59:57.728
What's wrong, come on!

59:57.762 --> 01:00:01.065
Stabilizers, stabilizers
are acting up again.

01:00:01.098 --> 01:00:01.799
Help me!

01:00:01.832 --> 01:00:02.899
How do you want me to help you??

01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:06.070
Keep it steady and in the
green so the targeting

01:00:06.103 --> 01:00:07.371
systems can work.

01:00:07.404 --> 01:00:08.338
Okay.

01:00:13.410 --> 01:00:14.912
Got it!

01:00:18.916 --> 01:00:20.050
Come on.

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:23.888
Come on, Armstrong!

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:35.866
Ha ha!

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:37.201
We got it!

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:41.271
We did it, right?

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.778
What's wrong?

01:00:50.748 --> 01:00:53.017
EMP isn't designed as an
anti-aircraft weapon.

01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.756
The Richter's power systems
are disabled but not for long.

01:01:00.190 --> 01:01:03.260
Doesn't matter anyway, the
clock on the nuke is ticking.

01:01:03.293 --> 01:01:04.895
They know I'm coming.

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.197
The Harbingers are probably setting up

01:01:08.198 --> 01:01:10.067
defensive positions as we speak.

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:15.239
I just need to establish
connection to GPS.

01:01:15.272 --> 01:01:16.473
So now what?

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:18.308
Oh, no no no dammit!

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:22.312
They disabled the beacon.

01:01:22.346 --> 01:01:24.181
I can't locate the drill site.

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:26.383
So is it at another warehouse?

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:28.953
No, it's like a, an industrial plant, a

01:01:28.986 --> 01:01:30.453
factory complex, something like that.

01:01:30.454 --> 01:01:33.090
Okay so you'll know it if you see it?

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:34.391
Yeah, sure.

01:01:36.994 --> 01:01:37.895
UAV.

01:01:49.106 --> 01:01:52.777
Once we find it, the sensor
sweep will gather data.

01:01:55.913 --> 01:01:58.382
Find the drill site, feed
the location back to the arm.

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:07.291
Right there.

01:02:07.324 --> 01:02:09.526
To the left.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:10.995
That's it!

01:02:12.062 --> 01:02:15.065
Good news is it looks
like it's abandoned.

01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:17.367
Maybe they called everyone off?

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.406
Nothing on infrared.

01:02:27.812 --> 01:02:29.212
Thermal scans are negative as well.

01:02:31.248 --> 01:02:33.050
Switching to radiation sweep.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.185
We find radiation, we find the bomb.

01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:44.261
Still nothing, gonna
increase the sensitivity.

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:03.914
There! There's a radiation peak.

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:06.116
That's the drill site.

01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:14.324
I can help you!

01:03:14.358 --> 01:03:15.025
I'm alright!

01:03:15.059 --> 01:03:16.560
No, you're not, you've been hit!

01:03:16.593 --> 01:03:17.561
I'm okay.

01:03:22.867 --> 01:03:24.868
Let's go. There's a
gate open on the south

01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:26.370
side of the complex. / Okay.

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:29.138
I'll keep the lights off,
we don't need to draw any

01:03:29.139 --> 01:03:30.474
more attention to us.

01:03:31.308 --> 01:03:32.542
Drive fast.

01:03:34.011 --> 01:03:35.479
I don't have much time.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:07.972
How do you feel?

01:05:09.206 --> 01:05:10.574
I'm fine.

01:05:12.176 --> 01:05:14.244
No, you're not.

01:05:14.278 --> 01:05:16.680
Look, the last site is
hidden on the other side

01:05:16.713 --> 01:05:19.549
of the plant. I can cut
through there on foot.

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:23.320
You're hurt, you can't
even walk straight.

01:05:23.353 --> 01:05:26.190
Lauren, I can't put anyone
else's life at risk.

01:05:26.223 --> 01:05:28.358
You said you needed help!

01:05:28.392 --> 01:05:30.660
How can you possibly fight them alone?

01:05:30.694 --> 01:05:34.431
Lauren, I can't have anyone
else die because of me!

01:05:34.464 --> 01:05:37.001
If I make the wrong choice, that's it!

01:05:37.034 --> 01:05:38.435
I can't live with that.

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:40.637
The Richter almost got us,
I don't want you to end up

01:05:40.670 --> 01:05:41.605
like Eddie!

01:05:43.507 --> 01:05:46.710
Now please, take the ambulance
and get away from here!

01:06:23.713 --> 01:06:24.714
Hey!

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:27.484
Hey.

01:06:27.517 --> 01:06:30.620
People have been leaving
me my whole life, I'm not

01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:33.390
gonna let you leave me too.

01:06:33.423 --> 01:06:35.325
I mean, we're partners now.

01:06:35.359 --> 01:06:38.128
You don't have to fight
this alone anymore.

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:41.064
Please.

01:06:41.065 --> 01:06:44.101
Lauren, you've already done
your part, you got me here.

01:06:45.369 --> 01:06:47.471
Now go. Go back to your family.

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:50.607
I don't have a fucking family.

01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:53.177
And neither do you.

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:55.179
I mean, come on, we need each other.

01:06:55.212 --> 01:06:59.116
No, we don't. Alright, go, and forget

01:06:59.149 --> 01:07:03.820
about all this, Lauren, go! /
Is that some sort of joke?

01:07:03.853 --> 01:07:06.423
What am I going to tell
the police about tonight?

01:07:06.456 --> 01:07:07.391
About Eddie?

01:07:07.424 --> 01:07:09.459
About why we didn't show
up at the warehouse?

01:07:09.493 --> 01:07:11.127
You think they're going to
believe a fucking word I

01:07:11.128 --> 01:07:12.662
tell them about you?

01:07:12.696 --> 01:07:16.833
About, about about about
the fucking Fifth Sun,

01:07:16.866 --> 01:07:20.237
about, that I killed a Harbinger?

01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:22.172
You tell them that I took you hostage.

01:07:22.206 --> 01:07:24.408
You tell them that it was
all my fault that I got away.

01:07:24.441 --> 01:07:26.843
No, if you leave me
here, I'm gonna be held

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:30.580
responsible for everything
that went down tonight.

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:33.716
You were just doing your job, Lauren.

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:36.153
Mm-mm. My job was to
get to the warehouse

01:07:36.186 --> 01:07:40.390
that you exploded. Instead,
we picked you up and

01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:43.126
helped you save the world, right?

01:07:43.127 --> 01:07:45.629
Right?

01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:50.500
I'm in this now.

01:07:50.534 --> 01:07:52.136
No turning back.

01:08:02.346 --> 01:08:03.513
Run!

01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:16.792
How are you gonna fight
them off and seal the

01:08:16.792 --> 01:08:18.428
drill site in time? / I can do it.

01:08:18.462 --> 01:08:20.796
No! Give me the detonator,
tell me where to place it.

01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.466
Lauren don't go, just run, now!

01:08:22.499 --> 01:08:24.533
Don't argue with me about this!

01:08:24.568 --> 01:08:26.803
You gotta trust me
like I'm trusting you.

01:08:26.836 --> 01:08:29.339
Okay. Alright, you take the detonator,

01:08:29.372 --> 01:08:30.774
I'll keep them off your trail.

01:08:30.807 --> 01:08:31.939
There's a shipping
container on the other

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:33.343
side of the plant.

01:08:33.377 --> 01:08:35.578
Go up those stairs and to the left.

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:37.281
Okay, and how do I get inside?

01:08:37.314 --> 01:08:39.448
That glove you're wearing is
interwoven with access sensors.

01:08:39.448 --> 01:08:41.251
Place your hand against
the Fifth Sun emblem,

01:08:41.285 --> 01:08:42.319
that's how you'll get in.

01:08:42.352 --> 01:08:44.787
When you're there, place
the detonator as close to

01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:46.356
the shaft as possible.

01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:47.790
You have fifteen minutes
before it triggers,

01:08:47.791 --> 01:08:50.760
so get the hell out
of there. You got it?

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:51.627
I got it.

01:08:51.661 --> 01:08:53.296
Okay, meet me back at the ambulance.

01:08:55.499 --> 01:08:57.567
Lauren, go, now!

01:10:37.767 --> 01:10:38.768
This one.

01:10:40.937 --> 01:10:41.971
Come on.

01:12:14.130 --> 01:12:15.865
Turn around.

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:32.882
Don't do this. /
A greater destiny awaits us.

01:12:32.916 --> 01:12:35.852
That's what they want
you to believe isn't it?

01:12:35.885 --> 01:12:40.089
Wait. Destroying Los
Angeles isn't saving it.

01:12:41.925 --> 01:12:46.430
You can't kill all those people. Please.

01:12:46.463 --> 01:12:48.031
It looks like you broke your leg.

01:12:48.064 --> 01:12:51.034
You will burn in the
fires of the Fifth Sun.

01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:53.436
You must be in a lot of pain.

01:12:53.437 --> 01:12:55.572
I'm an EMT.

01:12:55.605 --> 01:12:58.174
I can help you! If you let me.

01:12:59.643 --> 01:13:01.010
But we have to leave now.

01:13:01.044 --> 01:13:03.079
You will burn.

01:13:03.112 --> 01:13:07.884
You will burn in the fires
of the Fifth Sun, you will

01:13:07.917 --> 01:13:10.053
burn in the fires of the Fifth Sun!

01:13:38.815 --> 01:13:39.949
You'll be fine.

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:48.592
Alright, the detonator's in place.

01:13:49.593 --> 01:13:50.960
Here we go.

01:13:53.697 --> 01:13:54.964
Wha...?

01:13:57.100 --> 01:13:58.101
What...?

01:13:59.503 --> 01:14:00.169
Wha...?

01:14:08.144 --> 01:14:09.846
That was it? / Yeah!

01:14:24.661 --> 01:14:25.829
Shit.

01:14:25.862 --> 01:14:28.022
I can't take out the Richter,
my EMP capacitor was hit.

01:14:30.166 --> 01:14:31.535
Use this!

01:14:32.902 --> 01:14:34.704
If that'll work but... / But what?

01:14:34.738 --> 01:14:36.572
My triggering mechanism was
damaged, I can't activate

01:14:36.573 --> 01:14:38.608
the laser, I need an
external power source!

01:14:38.642 --> 01:14:40.610
Like, what you mean, like a jump start?

01:14:40.644 --> 01:14:41.945
Yes! Like a jump start!

01:14:43.713 --> 01:14:44.848
Got it!

01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:48.217
It's coming back around!

01:14:50.754 --> 01:14:53.189
This was 3000 volts but
only for a split second.

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:54.123
That should work!

01:14:54.157 --> 01:14:56.726
You gotta wire the
battery to these leads.

01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:59.829
When I'm ready to fire,
power the defibrillator.

01:14:59.863 --> 01:15:01.263
The timing has to be perfect to work

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:02.966
with the targeting system.

01:15:10.907 --> 01:15:13.910
It's getting closer.
Won't be long.

01:15:16.045 --> 01:15:16.746
Hurry!

01:15:17.614 --> 01:15:19.148
I've almost got it!

01:15:21.651 --> 01:15:23.086
We have to do this now!

01:15:24.721 --> 01:15:26.089
Charging!

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:32.929
Wait!

01:15:39.235 --> 01:15:40.169
Now!

01:15:58.755 --> 01:16:00.156
It's done!

01:16:00.189 --> 01:16:04.160
We did it. / Yeah!

01:16:10.934 --> 01:16:12.201
Are you okay?

01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:23.647
You're hit. Apply pressure.

01:16:24.848 --> 01:16:26.115
Lauren, no!

01:16:26.149 --> 01:16:27.082
I got to get to the wound.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.085
It's not what I need from you right now.

01:16:33.156 --> 01:16:34.724
C'mon, breathe.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:38.695
North... Mountains...

01:16:41.765 --> 01:16:43.232
Queen Charlotte Fault.

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:44.768
What?

01:16:44.801 --> 01:16:46.736
It's on here.

01:16:46.770 --> 01:16:48.838
It's all on here.

01:16:51.675 --> 01:16:54.110
I won't let you go.

01:16:54.143 --> 01:16:55.812
Where the next attack will be.

01:16:57.246 --> 01:16:59.048
I have to fix this.

01:17:02.686 --> 01:17:06.690
Yes, you can.

01:18:25.134 --> 01:18:27.436
It's my first night, that's all.

01:18:27.470 --> 01:18:29.205
Everybody's nervous on their first

01:18:29.238 --> 01:18:31.774
night of a new job.
You survive it...

01:18:31.775 --> 01:18:33.309
Eddie! Eddie!
Eddie, watch out!

01:18:33.342 --> 01:18:35.378
...and it only gets better.

01:18:37.113 --> 01:18:39.015
You've worked so hard for tonight.

01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:41.184
You told me you want to help people!

01:18:41.217 --> 01:18:42.919
How do you want me to help you??

01:18:43.787 --> 01:18:46.455
Ha ha! We got it!

01:18:50.426 --> 01:18:51.260
You gonna be okay?

01:18:52.896 --> 01:18:54.430
I'll be fine.

01:19:33.336 --> 01:19:36.439
Dispatch, ambulance 32.

01:19:36.472 --> 01:19:39.242
Ambulance 32, where
the hell have you been?

01:19:39.275 --> 01:19:40.209
What's your status?

01:19:40.243 --> 01:19:43.446
Ambulance 32, party down.

01:19:43.479 --> 01:19:45.148
Please send additional units.

01:19:45.181 --> 01:19:49.185
Ambulance 32, okay, okay.

01:19:50.854 --> 01:19:52.555
We'll get additional
units headed your way.

01:19:55.524 --> 01:19:57.861
The EMS supervisor's
requesting a phone call

01:19:57.894 --> 01:19:59.228
and a full report.

01:20:08.905 --> 01:20:11.174
Ambulance 32, do you copy?

01:20:13.042 --> 01:20:16.012
But how do you truly feel
this world will end?

01:20:16.045 --> 01:20:17.580
Ambulance 32? / Do you think

01:20:17.613 --> 01:20:19.883
we're going to have any kind of warning?

01:20:19.916 --> 01:20:21.384
Ambulance 32? / No.

01:20:21.417 --> 01:20:23.319
Do you copy? / Wrong.

01:20:23.352 --> 01:20:26.022
When it comes, and it
might already be here, the

01:20:26.055 --> 01:20:27.957
apocalypse will unfold /
Hello? Ambulance

01:20:27.991 --> 01:20:29.292
quietly and / 32, hello?

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:33.496
methodically, according to their plan.

01:20:33.529 --> 01:20:36.032
I've dropped a lot of death
and destruction on

01:20:36.065 --> 01:20:41.170
you tonight, people, but
this is not about despair,

01:20:41.204 --> 01:20:43.539
this is about action.

01:20:43.572 --> 01:20:47.010
I've always been a man of
hope, and I believe in the

01:20:47.043 --> 01:20:51.414
forces of good just as much as
the forces of evil!

01:20:51.447 --> 01:20:57.954
We will fight back, we
must fight back, we must.

01:21:37.460 --> 01:21:39.295
You're gonna be okay.

01:21:39.963 --> 01:21:42.231
You're all gonna be okay!
