WEBVTT

00:03.045 --> 00:04.587
Hey, guys. Come on.

00:09.593 --> 00:11.636
We need a doctor!

00:12.262 --> 00:13.471
We need a doctor!

00:14.765 --> 00:16.432
Stay with us, man.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.268
Oh, dude, this would suck so bad if you died.

00:20.062 --> 00:22.313
The Ders! He's unleashed the Ders!

00:30.447 --> 00:31.447
I'm fresh

00:33.033 --> 00:35.118
You gotta, you gotta
You gotta, gotta

00:35.202 --> 00:36.452
Gotta be fresh

00:39.748 --> 00:41.791
Any minute.

00:42.292 --> 00:44.669
Man, I swear I saw three out here yesterday.

00:44.753 --> 00:45.753
No way.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.755
-Must have been a family.
-Or a gang.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.091
Squirrel gangs are a real thing.
No, it's true.

00:50.175 --> 00:52.719
I saw a squirrel get busted
into a squirrel gang.

00:52.803 --> 00:54.762
-Jumped in, sure.
-Maybe he's getting jumped out.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.181
-They do both.
-That's true.

00:57.266 --> 00:59.225
Hey, do your squirrel call.
Let's get some action.

00:59.309 --> 01:00.393
Oh, yeah. You got it.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.820
-Here you go.
-Put it in the box.

01:13.323 --> 01:14.741
Thank you, sir. I'll check it.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.534
-Looks like we're getting full.
-Oh, my God.

01:16.618 --> 01:17.702
You see those mailman calves?

01:17.786 --> 01:20.788
I hate that man.
He comes over here, "Here, take the mail."

01:20.873 --> 01:21.998
It's your job to put it in the box, man.

01:22.082 --> 01:24.459
-Oh, hey. Big naturals.
-Nice.

01:24.543 --> 01:26.586
You like that. It's automo-bills.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.421
Ders! Hey, check it out.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.757
You've got mail from Crank Yankers.

01:30.841 --> 01:33.426
I wonder if I'm still banned
in all AOL chat rooms.

01:33.510 --> 01:34.802
Chuck it, man. I don't need it.

01:34.887 --> 01:36.846
What are you talking about?
You didn't even open it yet, man.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.515
Could be a signed set photo from Booty Call.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.350
Jamie Foxx? Didn't you ask him for one?

01:41.435 --> 01:42.852
Yes, I did, but that's not what it is.

01:42.936 --> 01:44.395
Hey, man. Come on. Don't open that.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.440
Ooh...
Irvine Central High School Alumni Swim Meet.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.859
See, I knew it'd be something you like.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.569
I'm not going and I never will.

01:51.820 --> 01:53.404
Whoa. Attitude.

01:53.489 --> 01:56.657
Dude! Why aren't we going to a place?

01:56.742 --> 02:00.119
I'm not going because the guy
who runs the event, Troy Torpey,

02:00.204 --> 02:01.996
got me voted off the state relay team
in high school.

02:02.372 --> 02:05.208
Okay, that doesn't seem right.
How could he do that?

02:05.292 --> 02:06.876
He told everyone on the team
that I got a boner

02:06.960 --> 02:08.753
in the showers, in the locker room,
which isn't true.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.004
So what? You got a boner in the shower.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.673
-No, I didn't.
-I get boners all the time.

02:13.008 --> 02:14.383
I actually have one right now.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.471
Peeping this hog.

02:18.555 --> 02:20.056
This monster.

02:20.349 --> 02:21.516
Peep this hog.

02:21.975 --> 02:24.644
You actually can't see it right now
because it's so small.

02:24.728 --> 02:26.270
Anyways, dude, it's all good.

02:26.355 --> 02:29.273
This is your chance to go back
and show those pricks from high school

02:29.566 --> 02:31.150
what an awesome dude you've become, man.

02:31.235 --> 02:33.110
Jocks, they peak in high school, all right?

02:33.195 --> 02:35.404
But nerds, they become Skrillex.

02:35.489 --> 02:38.783
Hey, guys, I was kidding. I've got a huge one.

02:38.867 --> 02:41.911
Like, I wasn't in either of those groups
in high school.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.037
Me neither.

02:43.121 --> 02:45.164
-I, like, did my own thing.
-Right. Exactly.

02:45.249 --> 02:47.166
You just sit in a corner. You watch them.

02:47.251 --> 02:49.293
You study them.
You learn how to laugh on cue.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.171
-Yes.
-Oh, my God.

02:52.256 --> 02:53.339
We would have been best friends
in high school.

02:53.423 --> 02:54.507
Best friends, believe it!

02:57.928 --> 02:59.679
We would have been
best friends in high school.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.514
-Sorry, Blake.
-I don't care.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.849
-Yeah, you do.
-No, no, no.

03:02.933 --> 03:06.018
No, it's not a problem. I mean, I hung out
with a bevy of ladies at lunch.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.187
-The lunch ladies, right?
-Oh, well, you know.

03:08.272 --> 03:10.189
We would just kind of hang out
in the cafeteria.

03:10.274 --> 03:11.232
'Cause they were lunch ladies.

03:11.316 --> 03:12.984
We would just sling taco boats.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.360
No, we know the story of the lunch ladies.

03:14.444 --> 03:16.362
No, but they had the stories, okay.

03:16.446 --> 03:18.948
-These girls had jokes!
-The lunch ladies.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.826
Yes, I worked in the cafeteria.
They were lunch friends to me.

03:22.202 --> 03:26.247
Ders, we are going to that dumb, stupid,
horrible-sounding swim thing.

03:26.331 --> 03:28.249
And you are going to go up to Torpey,

03:28.333 --> 03:30.710
and you're gonna say,
"We're not in high school anymore."

03:30.794 --> 03:32.128
And you're going to prove to him

03:32.212 --> 03:36.215
that you are the freaking top dog of them all,
besides me.

03:36.300 --> 03:37.592
All right, okay. Let's do it.

03:37.676 --> 03:39.719
-I'm gonna go pack my speedos.
-All right.

03:39.803 --> 03:40.803
Wait, wait, wait, whoa.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.221
We were watching squirrels, though.

03:42.306 --> 03:43.556
Yes, we were. I'm sorry. I just...

03:43.640 --> 03:45.057
Back to the squirrels again.

03:45.142 --> 03:46.559
Back to the squirrels again

03:46.643 --> 03:48.936
Back to the squirrels again
Back to the squirrels again

03:49.021 --> 03:52.690
We're looking at squirrels in the front yard

03:54.943 --> 03:56.944
This is about to be so cool.

03:57.029 --> 03:59.739
I'm so pumped, dude. Ders is gonna kill it.

03:59.823 --> 04:01.365
Yeah, I'm excited.

04:01.450 --> 04:05.578
Hey, do you remember how we used
to always crank it to Ders' old yearbooks?

04:05.662 --> 04:08.456
-Yeah, absolutely. Hottest high school ever.
-The hottest!

04:08.540 --> 04:10.583
Yeah, I was always into Aurora Brown,

04:10.667 --> 04:12.543
and then I got into Laura Rocca for a while.

04:12.628 --> 04:14.045
But now I found this new chick.

04:14.129 --> 04:17.715
This banging black chick on Ders' swim team
that I've been peeping.

04:17.799 --> 04:20.718
And I've really been building something
very special with her.

04:20.802 --> 04:24.597
It's like, more than masturbation.
It's, like, deeper.

04:25.432 --> 04:27.141
So, like, you don't even masturbate to her?

04:27.559 --> 04:31.228
No, I do, but it's like deeper.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.607
I get it, man. I mean,
that whole swim team is stacked, dude.

04:34.691 --> 04:35.816
They're a good-looking crew.

04:35.901 --> 04:38.027
Yeah, there's like that Asa Akira-looking
Asian chick?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.278
-Mama!
-Ooh!

04:39.363 --> 04:41.906
-She's got my jeans steaming.
-Oh, I freaking...

04:41.990 --> 04:43.157
I love chicks.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.077
All these chicks are about to be
at this party today, man!

04:46.161 --> 04:47.370
They're definitely gonna be there today.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.163
That's why I'm so freaking
psyched and pumped.

04:49.247 --> 04:52.750
Guys, I'm gonna ship out so wish me luck.

04:52.834 --> 04:56.337
Actually, we were gonna go with
if that's cool.

04:56.630 --> 04:57.630
All right. Cool!

04:57.714 --> 04:58.839
-All right.
-Yes!

04:58.924 --> 05:00.049
All right. Cool.

05:00.133 --> 05:02.051
I actually feel I need to change.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.636
I feel like I'm a little underdressed.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.471
Yeah, me too.
You got to have the perfect outfit

05:05.555 --> 05:07.473
for these type of occasions.

05:07.724 --> 05:09.308
Ders, are you read to...

05:09.893 --> 05:10.893
Hyah!

05:10.978 --> 05:12.728
This Torpey dude, or what?

05:12.813 --> 05:14.438
-You know it, man.
-Sick, man.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.774
Oh, wait up. Before we go in there...

05:16.858 --> 05:20.111
Um, just keep an eye on me and Adam
'cause we're not the strongest swimmers.

05:20.195 --> 05:21.737
-I'm very drown-able.
-Okay.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.489
And, you know, the deep end.

05:23.573 --> 05:26.075
It just will scare the chum out of me
if you know what I mean.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.159
Semen.

05:27.244 --> 05:28.452
No, 'rhea.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.997
Oh, when I get really scared, I secrete semen.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.082
- It's true.
- You'll be fine, okay?

05:33.166 --> 05:34.834
If you fall in, just don't panic.

05:34.918 --> 05:38.004
And remember... Here, I'll just...
Quick lesson.

05:38.088 --> 05:41.048
Hove, right, to hanging with Mr. Cooper

05:41.425 --> 05:43.801
and then up for an Asian girl laughing.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.927
Oh, yeah. I know about that.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.137
-Hov!
-Hov!

05:46.221 --> 05:48.764
Hanging with Mr. Cooper.
Asian girl laughing.

05:49.016 --> 05:50.891
Hov. Hanging with Mr. Cooper.

05:50.976 --> 05:52.351
Asian girl laughing.

05:52.436 --> 05:55.187
Oh, ay Chihuahua.

05:55.272 --> 05:57.106
She-Hulk's got a ride.

05:58.942 --> 06:02.194
Oh, my God, you guys,
it's my dream girl from high school.

06:02.279 --> 06:04.572
-What?
-Magda Marzuski!

06:04.656 --> 06:06.949
-Nice Escalade.
-Oh, thanks.

06:07.743 --> 06:10.244
-Actually, it's Magda Torpey now.
-What?

06:13.290 --> 06:15.541
Anders Boner-vik.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.626
-Look at you.
-Oh.

06:17.961 --> 06:19.545
Troy Torpey-nis.

06:19.629 --> 06:20.629
-Tor-penis.
-Yeah.

06:20.714 --> 06:21.756
That's funny, dude.

06:21.840 --> 06:24.383
I'm just messing around. You look good.

06:24.468 --> 06:26.135
Obviously, you remember Magda.

06:26.762 --> 06:28.721
Say hello to the little monsters
she bore for me,

06:28.805 --> 06:30.431
Declan and Caleb.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.391
You better believe I got them in the pool too.

06:32.476 --> 06:36.312
Declan just took down the last Chas Morton
Ten and under NAG Record in Orlando.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.105
No kidding. Orlando. Fast pool.

06:39.566 --> 06:40.900
- We should race if you're up for it.
- Yeah.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.777
All right, Caleb, Declan, hold your breath.

06:42.861 --> 06:44.945
Start now, exercises.

06:45.030 --> 06:47.907
Two, three, four.

06:47.991 --> 06:51.243
Oh, my God, you guys, he's still the man.
I can't do this.

06:51.328 --> 06:54.497
Ders, it's fine.
He's just handsome and rich,

06:54.581 --> 06:57.500
and banging Magda,
the "Lady Rock" Johnson,

06:57.584 --> 07:00.336
and you have...

07:02.214 --> 07:03.964
Blake, what does Ders have?

07:04.049 --> 07:06.467
Uh, Ders, you have...

07:07.469 --> 07:08.677
Lips.

07:17.020 --> 07:19.772
Anyway, I just think about that write-off.
It's a write-off.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.233
Yeah, my life's pretty sweet these days also.

07:22.317 --> 07:25.361
-Chef Ders is cooking up some tangy treats.
-What's that?

07:26.404 --> 07:27.947
You were talking about your life out there,

07:28.031 --> 07:31.033
-so I was just gonna catch up on stuff.
-Oh, right, right. So, where was I?

07:31.118 --> 07:32.326
-I was...
-Anyway...

07:32.410 --> 07:34.120
So, I got sick of running the hedge fund,

07:34.204 --> 07:36.622
and I met Ryan Lochte at Golden Goggles.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.165
He's on the board at USA Swimming.

07:38.333 --> 07:40.459
-No way.
-So, now I'm Lochte's money guy.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.086
-What?
-Making investments.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.546
Chasing sponsorships.

07:43.630 --> 07:46.006
He's the one who came up
with the term "j'yeah!"

07:46.842 --> 07:48.050
What?

07:48.135 --> 07:49.718
Oh, well, hey.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.221
You ever hear "tight butthole"?
I came up with that.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.140
I'm not sure I get it.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.976
But you and buttholes make sense.

07:58.687 --> 07:59.937
You are so funny.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.689
Hey, would you mind grabbing me that drink?

08:01.773 --> 08:02.898
Oh, of course.

08:03.733 --> 08:05.317
God, I wish Magda would let me do anal.

08:05.402 --> 08:08.279
She says it's unnatural.
No offense to you and your buddies.

08:09.656 --> 08:11.407
-I prefer snatch anyway.
-Mmm-hmm.

08:11.491 --> 08:14.660
-I mean, and she can go all night.
-"Snatch."

08:14.744 --> 08:17.163
I'm not ashamed to say I got to
pop a couple of Viagra just to keep up.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.247
Oh, yeah.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.415
-Voilà.
-Thank you.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.293
Anyway, it was really great catching up
with you, man. Cheers.

08:22.377 --> 08:23.335
Yeah.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.171
All right, you kiddos ready
to go get stretched out?

08:25.255 --> 08:26.630
You gonna win this one?

08:38.393 --> 08:39.685
Oh, there's my girl.

08:41.646 --> 08:44.940
Excuse me. Miss Cruz?

08:45.942 --> 08:48.152
-Yeah.
-Sorry for being so formal.

08:48.236 --> 08:52.740
It's just an honor to meet you.

08:54.451 --> 08:57.411
I'm friends with one of the alumni
swimmers here.

08:57.495 --> 09:01.373
and I've been admiring your photo
in the yearbook

09:01.458 --> 09:03.334
for quite some time now.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.961
You mean, like, pictures of me as a kid?

09:06.588 --> 09:07.588
Yeah.

09:08.089 --> 09:11.133
And may I say you still look very young.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.844
-Ew...
-In a good way, you still look very young.

09:13.929 --> 09:16.180
But cutting to the chase like a Ginsu,

09:16.973 --> 09:21.143
I was just wondering if maybe you would like
to accompany me to a sushi dinner?

09:21.394 --> 09:23.646
I love eating sashimi,

09:23.980 --> 09:27.900
but I would rather eat sashi-you.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.486
Ooh, not really into sushi.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.657
Thanks, though, and I'm not Japanese
if that's what you're doing.

09:34.741 --> 09:36.784
Yeah, no, it was. Sorry, I blew that.

09:36.868 --> 09:41.247
Oh, hey, so, Adam, what's up?
This is my girl, Sherry.

09:41.414 --> 09:44.708
-Uh, this is my ninja, Adam.
-Your girl?

09:44.793 --> 09:46.085
But this is...

09:48.338 --> 09:51.924
You're messing with the same girl, same girl

09:52.008 --> 09:55.886
How could the love of my life
and my potential wife be the

09:55.971 --> 09:57.763
The same girl
Same girl

09:57.847 --> 09:58.931
Same girl

09:59.015 --> 10:00.599
Just I can't believe

10:00.684 --> 10:02.518
Break the grip, break the grip.

10:02.602 --> 10:03.602
Ah!

10:03.937 --> 10:05.396
Okay...

10:05.605 --> 10:07.314
Ow! Adam, you're hurting me.

10:07.399 --> 10:09.275
Okay? Not in front of my girl.

10:09.526 --> 10:10.734
-Your girl?
-Yeah.

10:10.819 --> 10:12.194
- More like my girl.

10:12.279 --> 10:13.737
I'm the Macaulay Culkin of this situation.

10:13.822 --> 10:15.990
-What are you talking about?
-I'm talking about the movie My Girl!

10:16.074 --> 10:17.658
With the little girl, loves Macaulay Culkin

10:17.742 --> 10:19.785
so much she gets stinged by a ton of bees
and dies.

10:19.869 --> 10:21.453
-I thought he died.
-I don't know.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.663
I haven't seen the movie in a long time.

10:22.747 --> 10:23.747
It's besides the point, man.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.458
I thought you told me that your chick
was a black girl, dude.

10:27.377 --> 10:31.130
Yeah, and that girl is super black.
She's a super black beauty.

10:31.214 --> 10:33.215
And you said your girl was Asian.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.467
-And that is not what she looks like.
-She is...

10:35.802 --> 10:37.469
-Hey, Sherry...
-Sherry.

10:37.554 --> 10:38.762
What are you?

10:39.222 --> 10:40.848
- Excuse me?
- Your ethnicity.

10:40.932 --> 10:43.309
Yeah, your background,
like, your genetic buildup.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.644
Jesus... Filipino.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.813
Ha, that's Asian! That is Asian.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.523
On my dad's side. My mother is black.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.067
Yes! Okay, yeah.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.737
And half black equals full black.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.905
And that's not my rule, that's society's rule.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.824
That's why Drake can say the N-word
a million times,

10:58.908 --> 11:01.160
and everyone's like, "I love this song.
I want to dance to this song.

11:01.244 --> 11:02.286
"I want to slow grind to it."

11:02.370 --> 11:04.079
It's because he's Canadian
that's why he can say it.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.497
It means something different
in their language.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.915
I don't think that is the case.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.004
Look, she's obviously valuing both of her
Filipino and black heritage equally,

11:12.088 --> 11:17.009
so if anything, she's a full-bodied Pinot Noir.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.969
Okay, I'm offended

11:19.054 --> 11:23.349
because she's not a gross alcoholic
wine drink for adults.

11:23.433 --> 11:27.269
She is a chocolate-colored human being,
you racist fuck.

11:27.437 --> 11:28.854
-That was offensive.
-No, I'm offended.

11:28.938 --> 11:31.190
-That was offensive.
-How was that offensive?

11:31.274 --> 11:32.483
Chocolate?

11:32.567 --> 11:34.234
-It's a delicious treat.
-That is true.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.903
Okay, so that wasn't racist.

11:36.237 --> 11:38.113
Sherry, let's go get some Roscoe's.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.239
Okay.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.368
Hey, everybody, I just want to say
a few words real quick

11:42.452 --> 11:44.411
before the meet gets started.

11:44.496 --> 11:47.122
First of all, thank you all for showing up
here today.

11:47.332 --> 11:50.042
I really appreciate getting everybody
back together,

11:50.126 --> 11:53.504
and we've raised a lot of money
for this high school team, so...

11:53.797 --> 11:56.882
-You ready?
-Now I am. That felt really good.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.759
Good, get up there.

12:00.261 --> 12:05.349
It's especially fun to see our once
missing-in-action Anders Holmvik.

12:05.433 --> 12:08.310
- He's back. He's here, ready to shine!

12:08.395 --> 12:09.770
-Let's give it up for the Ders.
-That's our guy!

12:09.854 --> 12:11.814
Whoo! That's our friend. My friend.

12:11.898 --> 12:14.566
Why don't you get up here
and say a few words, Ders?

12:14.651 --> 12:16.068
-Nah.
-Get on up here.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.569
Come on, we want to hear from you.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.279
Our old pal, Ders. Let's give it up.

12:19.364 --> 12:21.740
-Yeah, get 'em Ders!
-Ders, doggy!

12:21.825 --> 12:22.783
Nice.

12:22.867 --> 12:24.618
Good to see you again.
Tell us what's on your mind.

12:24.702 --> 12:29.957
Man, just like you said, good to see everyone,

12:30.041 --> 12:32.793
and let's have some fun.
Just like old times, huh?

12:32.877 --> 12:35.087
-It will be just like old times.
-Yeah.

12:35.171 --> 12:37.631
'Cause you got a boner!

12:37.715 --> 12:40.008
-You got a boner!
-No! No, stop it!

12:40.093 --> 12:42.886
-Look at that! Look at that!
-I don't have a boner!

12:44.097 --> 12:45.806
-It's not bad, actually.
-Why does this keep happening?

12:45.890 --> 12:47.766
-He's got a decent one.
-It's super hard.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.768
I slipped you some Viagra
in that drink earlier.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.020
-No!
-I did. I did.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.940
You've been torpedoed.

12:55.233 --> 12:57.317
-There he goes.
-Yo!

12:57.402 --> 12:59.069
Where are you going with all our booze, bud?

13:00.613 --> 13:03.782
Maybe we ought to see
if Ders needs some alone time,

13:03.867 --> 13:05.534
'cause I'm gonna stick right around here.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.536
Hey, Sherry. What's up?

13:07.745 --> 13:10.122
About that Roscoe's,
I was thinking maybe we'd get it to go,

13:10.206 --> 13:11.623
take it to where you stay at.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.292
I don't even know you two.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.127
So, why would I even consider going out
to dinner

13:15.211 --> 13:17.045
with either of you two idiots?

13:17.338 --> 13:19.715
I already told you,
we know you from the yearbook.

13:19.799 --> 13:22.468
No, I don't. I swam for another school.

13:22.552 --> 13:23.927
Wow, big deal, all right?

13:24.012 --> 13:26.096
So what? He knows how to swim. So do I.
Check it out.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.723
Hov. Hanging with Mr. Cooper.

13:27.807 --> 13:28.974
-Asian girl laughing.
-Asian girl laughing.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.684
-Hov. Hanging with Mr. Cooper.
-Hov. Hanging with Mr. Cooper.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.269
-That's not a thing.
-No, it's a thing.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.520
It's like a swim stroke.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.564
Yeah, I mean Ders taught it to us,
so it's got to be real.

13:35.773 --> 13:38.901
Okay. You're friends of Anders.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.820
-I'm not.
-Stop lying to her, man.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.823
Just tell her you know her from the yearbook,
just like me, all right?

13:44.908 --> 13:46.492
Oh, and while you're at it,
why don't you tell her

13:46.576 --> 13:48.952
about your little relationship
with Aurora Brown?

13:49.412 --> 13:51.497
I don't crank it to her anymore,
and you know that.

13:51.581 --> 13:52.789
Okay, since when?

13:52.874 --> 13:55.125
Okay, 'cause I can't get serious
with a sophomore.

13:55.210 --> 13:56.543
That's social suicide.

13:59.881 --> 14:03.008
-The Ders.
-The Ders.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.178
-I just said that.
-Oh, did you? I didn't hear you.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.138
The Ders...

14:16.773 --> 14:18.357
Look at all these shotgun shells, man.

14:18.441 --> 14:21.318
He's been slamming them like no other
human I've ever seen.

14:22.320 --> 14:26.031
Well, except for me.
But to your point, I'm not fully human.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.866
My uncle, he was a zookeeper.

14:30.745 --> 14:32.788
-The Ders!
-Where is he?

14:35.124 --> 14:36.750
What the hell?

14:40.964 --> 14:43.215
It should be my name on that banner.

14:43.299 --> 14:46.218
Whoa, hey, spiders, man.

14:46.302 --> 14:49.680
Why don't you swoop on down here, buddy?
Very safely, though, please.

14:49.764 --> 14:52.224
Yeah, why do you worry so much
about banners, dude?

14:52.308 --> 14:54.393
Drake's not rapping about banners.

14:54.477 --> 14:56.603
-You're really into Drake, huh?
-He's, like, a real talent.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.897
I just found out about him
and he raps about trophies.

15:01.442 --> 15:03.819
I could just put my name on it, right?

15:05.405 --> 15:08.448
I'll just... I'll pull it down.

15:09.701 --> 15:12.369
And cross off Torpey's name
and make everything all right.

15:12.453 --> 15:15.247
If you do that, you're gonna destroy yourself.

15:15.331 --> 15:17.332
And actually, that's be awesome to watch,
so I vote yes.

15:17.667 --> 15:19.918
No, Anders. Okay, if you can hear me,

15:20.003 --> 15:23.088
if you're even in there anymore,
just come down, dude.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.256
We can fix this.

15:24.340 --> 15:25.674
I am fixing this.

15:40.815 --> 15:43.483
I got it!

15:44.777 --> 15:47.613
-Oh, my God!
-Yes, the Ders!

15:48.156 --> 15:49.281
Yeah!

15:49.991 --> 15:51.116
Yes!

15:51.200 --> 15:53.619
That could have gone way worse.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.829
-Uh, don't look down.
-Huh?

15:55.913 --> 15:59.791
'Cause you have an entire trophy
sticking out of your flubber.

16:00.918 --> 16:03.629
Oh, my God! What do I do?

16:03.713 --> 16:04.755
Just relax, dude.

16:04.839 --> 16:08.091
My uncle Bobby actually impaled himself
with a fire poker one Christmas.

16:08.176 --> 16:09.801
He had it in there until New Years.

16:09.886 --> 16:12.804
-Okay, so leave it in.
-Okay.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.056
Yeah, and he's fine now.

16:14.265 --> 16:17.225
No, no, he's dead.
They found him dead New Year's day

16:17.310 --> 16:18.393
'cause of the fire poker.

16:21.439 --> 16:23.398
We need a doctor!

16:24.025 --> 16:25.233
We need a doctor!

16:25.902 --> 16:27.235
Stay with us.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.820
The Ders is unleashed.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.447
Stay awake. Stay awake!

16:30.531 --> 16:31.907
You are heavy, you fat fuck.

16:33.493 --> 16:35.452
Is there a doctor in the house?

16:35.536 --> 16:37.371
Come on, Dersie, we're gonna take you
to the hospital.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.706
That's one way to get a trophy.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.334
What are you doing?

16:44.837 --> 16:46.171
What did you just say?

16:46.255 --> 16:48.674
I said that's one way to get a trophy, and it is.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.217
I'll kick your ass right now...

16:50.301 --> 16:52.552
At swimming.
I will kick your ass at swimming.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.264
One on one. 50 free.

16:56.849 --> 16:59.017
Oh, God. I hate these.

16:59.102 --> 17:00.268
No, no, no, no, actually, I love it.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.270
I needed a nap. I'm very tired.

17:03.147 --> 17:04.356
Zinger!

17:04.440 --> 17:07.651
I think you should definitely not race
and go immediately to the hospital.

17:07.735 --> 17:09.194
How convenient.

17:09.278 --> 17:12.239
Right after I challenge you,
you tell me to do that.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.866
Not happening, honky, bitch.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.618
Okay, let's do this.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.454
Let's do this right now.

17:20.957 --> 17:22.499
-Who's calling this?
-I'll call it, baby.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.000
Put that hammer down.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.550
On your marks...

17:35.972 --> 17:37.305
-Oh, God.
-Ders!

17:39.475 --> 17:41.017
Is somebody gonna go and save him?

17:41.102 --> 17:44.229
Uh, yes, Adam, he's the swimmer, right? Go.
Go save him, man.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.522
He's actually dying.

17:45.773 --> 17:48.066
Would you just go and save your friend?

17:48.151 --> 17:51.528
Fine, I'll be a hero. Save a man's life.
What's new?

17:51.612 --> 17:55.824
No, no, no, actually, I'm gonna be a hero too,
even though it is in the deep end, so...

17:56.075 --> 17:57.284
No!

18:05.084 --> 18:06.418
-Help!
-It's not working!

18:06.502 --> 18:07.502
Help!

18:14.343 --> 18:15.385
It's not working!

18:17.680 --> 18:19.264
I'll save Holmvik!

18:35.865 --> 18:37.073
Oh, my God.

18:40.203 --> 18:41.620
Come on, come on.

18:48.377 --> 18:51.630
Are you guys kidding me?
They're not even drowning!

18:53.216 --> 18:54.216
Jerks!

18:57.053 --> 18:58.929
Ders, don't die.

19:02.558 --> 19:05.060
Get off of me. Get off of me!

19:07.396 --> 19:09.731
-Hey.
-How are you doing? Are you all right?

19:10.441 --> 19:12.818
What are you guys doing?
You guys got to get him to a hospital.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.736
Hey. Torpey.

19:15.905 --> 19:19.324
I did get a boner that day in the showers
in high school.

19:19.408 --> 19:20.534
I know.

19:20.743 --> 19:23.995
But I want to know what's up with you
kissing a dude here today

19:24.080 --> 19:26.957
in front of all these people?
Right, guys? You see him?

19:27.041 --> 19:27.999
He was kissing Ders.

19:28.084 --> 19:29.334
What's up with that, right?

19:29.418 --> 19:30.710
-He's still got it!
-Huh?

19:30.795 --> 19:32.754
-Yeah.
-He just saved your life, man.

19:34.715 --> 19:35.966
-What?
-Yes, he did.

19:36.050 --> 19:37.050
Let's get you out of here.

19:37.134 --> 19:38.134
I just don't remember.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.762
I thought he was kissing me.

19:40.972 --> 19:42.389
Later, Tor-penis.

19:47.812 --> 19:51.606
Oh, man. These pain pills are kicking in
right about now.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.150
You got to eat something before, bud.

19:54.235 --> 19:55.694
Sherry Cruz.

19:55.778 --> 19:58.280
Yep, the one that got away.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.198
She doesn't know what she's missing, man.

20:00.283 --> 20:01.283
She really doesn't, man.

20:01.367 --> 20:02.492
She missed out on some good guys.

20:02.577 --> 20:04.286
-Yeah.
-Well, whatever...

20:04.370 --> 20:06.705
-Oh, look at Allison Fields.
-Oh!

20:06.789 --> 20:08.665
-Oh, my gosh!
-Holy moley.

20:08.749 --> 20:11.376
-I'm into that.
-I'm calling dibs right now.

20:11.878 --> 20:15.547
You can't do that because I'm the one
who actually pointed her out.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.174
-Squirrel. Squirrel!
-There's a squirrel!

20:18.259 --> 20:19.217
-A squirrel.
-Oh, no!

20:19.302 --> 20:20.510
I want to see the squirrel!

20:20.595 --> 20:21.595
There's a squirrel right there!

20:23.139 --> 20:24.764
Okay. Well, all right.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.808
What's he doing? I want to go see it.

20:26.893 --> 20:28.894
Is he eating the hot dog off my trophy?

20:28.978 --> 20:30.020
Uh...

20:30.104 --> 20:31.229
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.397
Yeah.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.357
Oh, it's a little baby girl squirrel.

20:34.442 --> 20:37.068
Oh, look! It's eating it.

20:37.153 --> 20:39.404
-Look at its big bushy tail.
-Aw!

20:39.488 --> 20:40.488
Oh, it's so cute!

20:40.990 --> 20:43.158
It's, oh... Why is it looking at me like that?

20:43.242 --> 20:44.492
-What is that look in its eyes?
-Oh, Blake!

20:44.744 --> 20:46.411
- It's chasing me, Blake!
- No!

20:46.495 --> 20:49.331
-It's chasing me.
-Adam, drop the hot dog!

20:50.583 --> 20:51.791
The gangs are real!

20:52.001 --> 20:53.251
Blake, save him. Help him!

20:53.336 --> 20:54.961
Oh, they're wearing matching bandanas!

20:55.046 --> 20:56.922
Oh, my God!

21:04.221 --> 21:05.221
J'yeah.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.140
J'yeah!

21:08.225 --> 21:09.225
There you go.

21:10.144 --> 21:11.144
J'yeah!

21:12.438 --> 21:14.105
Does anybody want to go to Roscoe's?

21:14.190 --> 21:15.190
J'yeah!

21:15.566 --> 21:16.900
Oh, she's really cooking.
