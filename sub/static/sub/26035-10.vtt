WEBVTT

00:01.669 --> 00:03.737
-(knocking)
-FRANK: Mac, Mac, open up!

00:03.771 --> 00:06.140
Let me in! There's no time
to waste! Come on!

00:06.174 --> 00:08.142
Come on, man!
I know you're in there!

00:08.176 --> 00:10.711
Oh, that's it! I'm coming in!

00:11.745 --> 00:14.715
Ow! Oh, shit!

00:14.748 --> 00:16.217
I just opened up the old cut.

00:16.250 --> 00:17.985
Why didn't you open the door?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.987
-It wasn't locked.
-Come on, we got to get going.

00:20.020 --> 00:21.689
You got any ice in there? Ow.

00:21.722 --> 00:23.491
They put me in charge.

00:23.524 --> 00:26.160
-It's a gay pride parade
or something.
-(refrigerator opens, closes)

00:26.194 --> 00:27.661
Can I use this sock?

00:27.695 --> 00:28.729
Oh, my God.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.264
We're making a float
for the parade,

00:30.298 --> 00:31.765
to rope in the gays.

00:31.799 --> 00:34.268
Ow! But we only got 24 hours.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.703
I'm gonna use this newspaper.

00:35.736 --> 00:37.004
(grunts)
I stuff it up.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.672
I plug it. Okay.

00:38.706 --> 00:41.209
Well, you're gonna be
our prize gay.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.177
You're gonna dance on top.
They told me to get you.

00:43.211 --> 00:46.280
I told 'em, "I don't get
the whole gay thing."

00:46.314 --> 00:49.717
I drew the short straw,
so here I am. Let's roll.

00:49.750 --> 00:52.386
I-I don't want to do that,
because I-I just...

00:52.420 --> 00:54.688
I don't know where I fit in
as a gay man,

00:54.722 --> 00:56.224
and it's starting to get to me.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.759
Oh, Christ! Now?

00:58.792 --> 01:01.529
They give me one job and I got
to deal with your feelings?

01:01.562 --> 01:02.896
I-I don't know. I-I...

01:02.930 --> 01:05.199
I'm not feeling very proud.

01:05.233 --> 01:08.402
A-All right. Look, Mac,
I never really got you.

01:08.436 --> 01:11.071
And-and, to be honest,
now that you're gay,

01:11.105 --> 01:12.740
I get you even less.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.041
Nothing against it.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.043
I just don't get it.

01:16.076 --> 01:18.579
But let's try
and work together, okay?

01:18.612 --> 01:20.714
Help me help you, all right?

01:20.748 --> 01:22.216
All right. I guess. Sure.

01:22.250 --> 01:24.218
Okay. Let's go find your pride.

01:24.252 --> 01:26.254
*

01:48.008 --> 01:49.443
Where exactly
are you taking me, Frank?

01:49.477 --> 01:52.313
Your problem is you're
only hanging out with straights.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.915
I'm gonna take you to a club
where you can meet a few guys,

01:54.948 --> 01:56.784
maybe snap you out
of that funk you're in.

01:56.817 --> 01:58.419
All right.
I just don't know if I'm ready

01:58.452 --> 02:00.321
for a relationship, you know?

02:00.354 --> 02:01.922
You're just scared, is all.

02:01.955 --> 02:05.259
You got to meet
a couple of normal gays.

02:05.293 --> 02:06.927
And, by the way,
when we're in there,

02:06.960 --> 02:08.429
you got to watch my back.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.265
If one of these queens comes
at me, I'm gonna go berserk.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.800
Frank, you're a 75-year-old man

02:12.833 --> 02:14.268
with a face
that looks like hamburger meat.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.436
I'm sure you're safe.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.604
Yeah.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.606
L-Let's try to blend in.

02:18.639 --> 02:20.441
Okay.

02:20.474 --> 02:22.443
(techno music playing)

02:22.476 --> 02:24.378
Ooh.

02:25.379 --> 02:27.981
MAC:
Jesus Christ, Frank.

02:28.015 --> 02:30.184
Isn't this what all gay guys
are into?

02:30.218 --> 02:33.187
I-I don't think so, but, either
way, I know I'm not into it.

02:33.221 --> 02:35.789
A-All right, all right, relax.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.358
Let's hit the buffet.
We'll hang back.

02:37.391 --> 02:39.227
We'll scope out the scene.
(chuckles)

02:39.260 --> 02:41.128
Okay? Ooh, look at that.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.364
Ooh. This is
a much better spread

02:43.397 --> 02:45.499
than they have
at the straight orgies.

02:45.533 --> 02:48.802
-Yeah, I don't feel comfortable
in here, Frank.
-Oh. Hmm.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.138
I know. That's why you got
to jump in headfirst.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.974
Go find some nice guys,
smack you around a little bit.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.509
I don't want
to get smacked around.

02:55.543 --> 02:57.144
That's part of the culture, Mac.

02:57.177 --> 02:59.413
It's a very small subset
of the culture.

02:59.447 --> 03:01.081
And it's totally fine
for these guys,

03:01.114 --> 03:02.983
but it's just
a little too much for me.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.853
Too... Ow.
Oh, and this cut.

03:05.886 --> 03:07.488
I got to take 'em out
and restuff.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.323
-Oh, God.
-Goddamn, dude,
that is disgusting.

03:09.357 --> 03:11.659
-Mm, I got to plug it.
I got to plug it up.
-Oh!

03:11.692 --> 03:13.661
-You're putting it
in the chicken?
-Got to... Yeah.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.163
-What are you... Oh, my God.
-No, I got to keep it plugged.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.666
Ooh, ooh, ooh, that's spicy.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.335
Ooh, there must be some hot
sauce on them wings. (groans)

03:21.369 --> 03:23.036
-They're buffalo wings.
-(grunts)

03:23.070 --> 03:25.706
-Let me try one.
-Don't eat the god... Oh, Frank.

03:25.739 --> 03:26.874
(muffled shouting)

03:26.907 --> 03:28.175
Oh, look out. Incoming.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.445
Um, how may we help you?

03:31.479 --> 03:33.247
(muffled shouting)

03:33.281 --> 03:36.149
Mac, unzip this thing, so
we can find out what it wants.

03:37.418 --> 03:40.187
Sir, I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.622
Why? Because I'm straight?

03:41.655 --> 03:44.425
No. Because you put
your nose rags in the chicken.

03:44.458 --> 03:47.227
Oh, uh, excuse me, Your
Highness, I'll be more careful.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.562
Hey, how much I got to pay you

03:48.596 --> 03:51.365
to let my boy Mac here
take you for a spin?

03:51.399 --> 03:52.900
I'm not a prostitute.

03:52.933 --> 03:54.868
-You do this for fun?
-Yes.

03:54.902 --> 03:57.037
I'm never gonna get it.
I'll never get this.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.939
Why did I get this mission?

03:58.972 --> 04:00.874
-I... You see,
I drew the short straw.
-Okay.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.876
-Uh, let's go, Frank.
I'm so sorry, sir.
-That's it. (groaning)

04:02.910 --> 04:05.479
W-We'll be leaving.
Frank, let's just go home.

04:05.513 --> 04:08.482
No, no, no. No, Goldilocks,
we're not going home.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.284
You got to find that pride.

04:10.318 --> 04:12.052
Okay, this place is
a little too rough.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.754
I-I admit it. Fine.

04:13.787 --> 04:16.256
We're gonna go someplace softer.

04:16.290 --> 04:19.460
* Oh, no, no, finally,
it has happened to me *

04:19.493 --> 04:23.397
* Right in front of my face, my
feelings can't describe it... *

04:23.431 --> 04:25.399
(exhales)
So, you see anything you like?

04:25.433 --> 04:27.067
Not really.
These are drag queens, Frank.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.769
Come on, Mac. Help me out.

04:28.802 --> 04:31.739
I'm sticking my neck out for you
and you're giving me nothing.

04:31.772 --> 04:33.574
How are you sticking your neck
out for me?

04:33.607 --> 04:35.976
I'm running a real risk
coming to a joint like this.

04:36.009 --> 04:37.244
I mean, one false move,

04:37.277 --> 04:39.580
these fairies could
poke me full of holes.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.149
Fairies?
What year is it in your head?

04:42.182 --> 04:43.684
Well, help me out here, man.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.486
We're running out of time.

04:45.519 --> 04:47.154
When you came out
to your father, did you come out

04:47.187 --> 04:48.422
as a top or a bottom?

04:48.456 --> 04:49.923
A boy or a girl?

04:49.957 --> 04:51.124
Oh, I haven't come out
to him yet.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.326
Well, maybe that's it.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.094
You got to tell your dad.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.664
Yeah, I-I just don't think
I can come out and tell him.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.265
I-I feel like I got to show him.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.867
And-and I've been working
on something, actually,

04:59.900 --> 05:02.269
but it's just gonna take me
a few more weeks, so...

05:02.302 --> 05:03.937
No, no, weeks, weeks, no.

05:03.971 --> 05:05.773
-We got to be
on that float tomorrow.
-(sighs)

05:05.806 --> 05:07.441
Look... (sighs) I don't know
what to tell you, man.

05:07.475 --> 05:10.177
You just don't... you don't know
what's going on inside of me.

05:10.210 --> 05:12.179
Well, I'm sure
there's five or six superviruses

05:12.212 --> 05:14.515
-eating out your insides.
-No, no.

05:14.548 --> 05:16.784
I mean the struggle
to be who I am.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.453
I-I just want to show him,
so that he can understand.

05:19.487 --> 05:21.121
All right, well,
explain it to me.

05:21.154 --> 05:22.890
Okay, well, there's...

05:22.923 --> 05:24.825
there's, like,
this storm inside of me

05:24.858 --> 05:27.160
and-and it's been raging
my whole life.

05:27.194 --> 05:30.798
And-and I'm down on my knees
and-and I'm-I'm looking

05:30.831 --> 05:32.466
for answers
and then God comes down

05:32.500 --> 05:34.802
to me--
and it's a very hot chick--

05:34.835 --> 05:37.571
-and she pulls me up
and we start dancing, okay?
-W-Wait, wait, wait.

05:37.605 --> 05:39.573
You're gay and you're dancing
with a hot chick

05:39.607 --> 05:41.375
-who is God?
-Yes.

05:41.409 --> 05:43.744
-The Catholics
really fucked you up.
-Oh, you didn't get it?

05:43.777 --> 05:45.479
-I'm never gonna get it.
-Okay. All right.

05:45.513 --> 05:47.214
-Let me start at the beginning,
and I'll...
-No, no. Wait.

05:47.247 --> 05:48.749
Christ, I'm sweating.

05:48.782 --> 05:50.751
My-my head is exploding.

05:50.784 --> 05:54.021
I'm gonna try some of this...
put a little of this...

05:54.054 --> 05:55.823
It'll be good.

05:55.856 --> 05:57.558
(screams)

05:57.591 --> 05:59.226
Aah! Aah!

05:59.259 --> 06:00.561
Ah, shit!

06:00.594 --> 06:02.029
Ah, that burns.

06:03.964 --> 06:07.868
Oh, Christ, it's swelling.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.369
-(groans)
-Frank, I think your nose

06:09.403 --> 06:11.204
-is infected, man.
-No, no, no, no.

06:11.238 --> 06:12.940
I got...
I'm using this insulation

06:12.973 --> 06:15.175
-to plug up the flow. I just...
-(lock buzzes)

06:15.208 --> 06:17.177
Yeah, that seems safe.
Oh, shit! Here he comes.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.513
-I'm freaking out.
-Don't-don't dance around it.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.682
Just tell him.
Rip the Band-Aid off.

06:21.715 --> 06:23.283
-He'll be cool. You'll see.
-He'll be cool.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.752
-Yeah.
-Yeah, he's cool, he's cool.

06:24.785 --> 06:26.186
Yeah.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.521
-Go for it.
-Yeah.

06:27.555 --> 06:30.057
H-Hey.

06:31.091 --> 06:33.393
(clears throat)

06:34.828 --> 06:37.197
Hey, Dad! H-Hey, it's, uh...

06:37.230 --> 06:38.866
it's-it's been a couple years.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.868
-(chuckles) So, how you been?
-Yeah.

06:40.901 --> 06:44.271
My cellmate ratted on me
for having an extra pillow.

06:44.304 --> 06:47.475
I cut out his tongue
with a rusty pair of pliers

06:47.508 --> 06:50.444
and fed it to the maggots.

06:51.979 --> 06:54.748
Cool...

06:54.782 --> 06:57.618
Very cool.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.553
MAC:
So, um...

06:59.587 --> 07:00.821
there's something that, uh,

07:00.854 --> 07:03.624
I've been meaning to tell you
for a while now.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.058
Uh-huh...

07:05.092 --> 07:07.394
All right, there's, like,
a storm inside of me, all right?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.898
And-and-and...
and God sent me an angel...

07:10.931 --> 07:14.101
-an angel, and this...
this angel is a woman.
-No. Don't.

07:14.134 --> 07:15.936
And this woman and I--
we start dancing,

07:15.969 --> 07:17.505
and we get very passionate,
and then...

07:17.538 --> 07:20.107
It's all very confusing,
but in the end,

07:20.140 --> 07:22.109
something new is born.

07:22.142 --> 07:25.278
Well, wha-what
he's trying to say...

07:25.312 --> 07:28.482
Oh, I know exactly
what he's trying to say.

07:28.516 --> 07:30.684
My son...

07:30.718 --> 07:33.286
finally knocked someone up.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.422
I'm gonna be a grandfather.

07:35.455 --> 07:37.691
(laughing)

07:37.725 --> 07:39.126
-Uh...
-Finally!

07:39.159 --> 07:42.095
Someone to carry on my name.

07:42.129 --> 07:43.764
(laughing)

07:43.797 --> 07:45.332
Yeah, I mean...

07:45.365 --> 07:47.601
You know,
I-I could carry on your name.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.870
Yeah. Son, listen to me.

07:49.903 --> 07:53.273
I never really got you,

07:53.306 --> 07:54.441
you know?

07:54.474 --> 07:56.977
But now,

07:57.010 --> 08:00.447
I see that there's hope
for you yet.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.551
Well, I-I mean,
not with your life,

08:03.584 --> 08:06.453
but with the life of your son.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.622
Well, we don't know
that it's gonna be a boy.

08:08.656 --> 08:11.224
Hey, if it's not a boy,

08:11.258 --> 08:14.862
you flush that shit out
and try again!

08:14.895 --> 08:16.496
Yeah. Yeah, definitely.

08:16.530 --> 08:17.831
I'll flush that shit out,
and you...

08:17.865 --> 08:19.166
I'm gonna give you a boy, Dad.

08:19.199 --> 08:21.134
(laughing)

08:21.168 --> 08:22.803
I'm gonna be a grandfather.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.806
We will! Dad, you are gonna be
a grandfather. Daddy.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.741
-Uh, Dad? Dad?
-(laughing continues)

08:27.775 --> 08:29.409
Hey, Dad? Yeah, Dad.

08:29.442 --> 08:31.645
Oh, no, he had to go.
The guards called him back.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.080
The guards called him back.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.915
Oh, that went well.

08:39.286 --> 08:42.022
-(groaning)
-CHARLIE: Frank? Frank?

08:42.055 --> 08:45.358
-Aah! Ah, this goddamn cut!
-Yeah...

08:45.392 --> 08:47.327
-Oh!
-Trying to plug it up.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.495
-Whoa!
-But I can't stop it.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.197
-Holy shit!
-Oh.

08:50.230 --> 08:53.734
I'm using lemon juice and
hot glue to close up the wound.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.102
-Uh, yeah, okay.
-Huh?

08:55.135 --> 08:57.170
-All right, look,
where's Mac, dude?
-Huh?

08:57.204 --> 08:58.872
-Mac. You were supposed
to get him. Where is he?
-Yeah!

08:58.906 --> 09:01.041
-Yeah!
-Yeah! Well, is he...
is he here? Come on.

09:01.074 --> 09:03.577
-He's coming.
-All right, well, good.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.212
-Well, he's super late,
though. Come on.
-(grunts)

09:05.245 --> 09:07.347
No big deal
if he doesn't do it, right?

09:07.380 --> 09:09.950
I mean, we could
find somebody else.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.384
Someone else? Come on, come on.

09:11.418 --> 09:13.854
What are you gonna have you, me,
dancing on top of the gay float?

09:13.887 --> 09:15.889
-No.
-No, no, the press'll murder us!

09:15.923 --> 09:17.524
-We need
an authentically gay man.
-Huh.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.526
They'll see right through it,
man. They'll kill us.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.429
I didn't know you guys
were taking this so seriously.

09:22.462 --> 09:23.597
We're taking it very seriously.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.932
You know what?
I got something to show you.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.767
Come look, okay?
That will change everything.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.568
Hey-oh!

09:28.602 --> 09:30.537
-Holy shit!
-(laughs)
-*

09:30.570 --> 09:32.806
-Yeah, right?
-Right?
-Huh? Oh!

09:32.840 --> 09:34.541
-I mean,
this thing's amazing, man.
-Aw.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.910
Like, it's got a working bar,
it's got these confetti cannons.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.578
-Huh.
-It's even got, like, a shower

09:38.612 --> 09:40.047
-that's gonna pour water
on Mac...
-Ooh.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.882
-...while he does his,
like, sexy gay dance...
-Oh!

09:41.915 --> 09:43.250
...or whatever the hell he's
been working on this whole time.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.718
-Yeah.
-So, the only thing
that's missing...

09:44.752 --> 09:46.153
-Yeah?
-...is Mac!

09:46.186 --> 09:48.221
Yeah. Uh, uh...

09:48.255 --> 09:50.791
Yeah, good, good.
No problem, I got that covered.

09:50.824 --> 09:51.992
-I got it.
-I hope so, dude,

09:52.025 --> 09:53.426
'cause you only had one job
to do, man.

09:53.460 --> 09:54.728
I got it, I got it.
(groans)

09:54.762 --> 09:57.430
Go, go. Don't mess around
the bar. Go!

09:59.266 --> 10:02.736
Sure. What? Ugh!
(mutters)

10:02.770 --> 10:05.238
(door squeaks open)

10:05.272 --> 10:07.107
Who the hell are you?

10:07.140 --> 10:09.076
Who the hell are you?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.011
Oh!

10:11.044 --> 10:13.180
Ah, no!

10:13.213 --> 10:15.448
-Mac!
-What do you want, Frank?

10:15.482 --> 10:17.250
You were banging that broad,
weren't you?

10:17.284 --> 10:19.753
You're-you're trying
to get a girl pregnant

10:19.787 --> 10:22.289
just because that's what
your father wants you to do!

10:22.322 --> 10:25.759
-Ah! Ah! Ah.
-No, no. Frank,
that's not what it is, man.

10:25.793 --> 10:27.194
You don't understand.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.362
You're going back in the closet,
aren't you?

10:29.396 --> 10:32.766
I can't stand it.
Nobody can stand it. Ah.

10:32.800 --> 10:34.768
I'm not going back
in the closet, all right?

10:34.802 --> 10:36.704
I-I just need
to come out to him my way,

10:36.737 --> 10:38.605
and I'm not ready
to do that yet, all right?

10:38.638 --> 10:41.141
Ah! Ah! I don't care!

10:41.174 --> 10:44.011
You're coming with me,
you're going on that float.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.113
No! Frank, I'm not ready.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.281
I don't want to do it,
and you can't make me.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.517
Fine! Fine. Okay.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.786
Stay here and bang your broads

10:52.820 --> 10:54.955
and feel sorry for yourself.
You know, I don't care.

10:54.988 --> 10:57.457
I don't need you.
I'll get another gay.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.659
Somebody way hotter than you.

10:59.693 --> 11:01.494
(sighs)

11:01.528 --> 11:03.296
FRANK:
Hey-oh!

11:03.330 --> 11:06.800
Allow me to introduce
Paddy's top gay,

11:06.834 --> 11:09.703
a man everybody
in the neighborhood knows,

11:09.737 --> 11:11.404
everybody loves.

11:11.438 --> 11:14.507
The gay that will rope in
all the gays.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.509
-Cricket!
-What?

11:16.543 --> 11:19.512
-Hey! Huh?
-Oh! Ah, ha, ha, ha.

11:19.546 --> 11:23.851
(grunting rhythmically)

11:23.884 --> 11:25.853
Oh! (laughs) Yeah.

11:25.886 --> 11:27.087
-Huh?
-Yeah.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.488
What the hell, Frank?
Where's Mac?

11:28.521 --> 11:30.157
-Mac's out.
-Why?!

11:30.190 --> 11:31.524
-Well, I think he's
going back in the closet.
-Goddamn it.

11:31.558 --> 11:33.994
You had one job: get the gay man
to dance on the gay float.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.228
-I know. No, he's, he...
-It's not that hard.

11:35.262 --> 11:36.429
We got a problem.
We got a problem.

11:36.463 --> 11:37.697
Dennis doesn't want to drive.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.032
Now he's saying
he's claustrophobic under there.

11:39.066 --> 11:40.267
What is Cricket doing here?

11:40.300 --> 11:41.534
-DEE: Because Frank blew it!
-Aw, come on, man.

11:41.568 --> 11:43.503
-You had one job to do.
-That's what I said.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.405
Cricket's gonna do the dance.
Dance, Cricket. Go. Dance.

11:45.438 --> 11:47.841
No. No, no, no. He look...
Oh, God. No! Come on, man.

11:47.875 --> 11:50.343
-No.
-He looks like a monster,
and you look like a monster.

11:50.377 --> 11:52.846
We're not trying to invite
a bar full of monster men.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.848
We're-we're looking
for high-spending gay men.

11:54.882 --> 11:56.083
Yeah, but get Dennis to dance.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.250
You can't get
the straight man to dance.

11:57.284 --> 11:58.685
The press would murder us.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.387
The press doesn't give two shits
about us.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.355
Frank, it's 2018,
and you're the only person

12:02.389 --> 12:04.091
who doesn't seem
to understand gay culture.

12:04.124 --> 12:05.425
That's true. That's true.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.627
My head is swelling with blood.

12:07.660 --> 12:09.229
Goddamn it, Charlie. We got to
be there in 20 minutes.

12:09.262 --> 12:10.430
-All right. You know what?
-(Frank groaning)

12:10.463 --> 12:11.765
Um, Cricket, fine.
You can dance. Let's go.

12:11.799 --> 12:13.033
-Yo.
-Frank, can you at least

12:13.066 --> 12:14.434
-drive the thing? Let's go.
-Yeah. All right.

12:14.467 --> 12:15.969
-Yes.
-You're driving.
You'll squeeze in there.

12:16.003 --> 12:18.371
-You drive.
-Come on, man.
-Uh, no, no, no, no, no.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.875
Lady, I'm not going anywhere
until I see an Abraham Lincoln.

12:21.909 --> 12:23.944
Here you go.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.278
What is this? What is this?

12:25.312 --> 12:28.215
-Like, 73 cents.
-No. I-I said Abraham Lincoln.

12:28.248 --> 12:30.250
-There's a bunch of Lincolns
in there.
-Oh, those are pennies!

12:30.283 --> 12:31.785
-Okay. You want
to give it back to me?
-Well, no. Hold on.

12:31.819 --> 12:33.320
-Okay, you're gonna do it?
-Yeah, I'll do it.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.222
-Yes, of course I'll do it.
(scoffs)
-Then go do it. Go!

12:35.255 --> 12:36.423
-(grunts)
-(door squeaks closed)

12:36.456 --> 12:37.657
All right, now wait a second.

12:37.690 --> 12:38.892
How do you turn it on?
First the lights.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.293
-(engine starts)
-What is that?

12:40.327 --> 12:42.062
Oh, that must be...

12:42.095 --> 12:44.131
Okay, let's see
what we got here.

12:44.164 --> 12:47.134
Okay, uh,
"Start north on Second Street.

12:47.167 --> 12:51.004
Turn right on...
Dickens Avenue."

12:51.038 --> 12:52.840
Straight to... What the...?

12:52.873 --> 12:56.176
Oh. Oh, shit. I... (groans)

12:56.209 --> 12:59.446
Oh, God. Oh, this is ridiculous.

12:59.479 --> 13:01.915
Oh, shit, I can't do this.

13:01.949 --> 13:04.918
You know what? Screw this.

13:04.952 --> 13:06.920
No good.

13:06.954 --> 13:09.089
-(knocking)
-FRANK: Mac?

13:09.122 --> 13:10.690
-Mac?
-(knocking)

13:10.723 --> 13:12.625
Mac, come here.
Let me in. Let me in.

13:12.659 --> 13:14.661
-I'm gonna break the door down!
-(woman speaking on TV)

13:14.694 --> 13:19.499
One. Two. Three.

13:19.532 --> 13:21.168
Whoa. Ah, sh...

13:21.201 --> 13:23.636
Ah, shit!

13:23.670 --> 13:26.439
Jesus, Frank, that's a lot of
blood. Is that from just now?

13:26.473 --> 13:29.209
Oh, no. No, that's from earlier.

13:29.242 --> 13:32.612
You-you see, Mac, I've been
in agony the whole day,

13:32.645 --> 13:34.814
but I came to this realization

13:34.848 --> 13:37.284
that sometimes
you got to let the blood flow

13:37.317 --> 13:39.119
in order to start the healing.

13:39.152 --> 13:41.821
Some cuts
you just can't plug up.

13:41.855 --> 13:45.025
That's the same for you.
You got this thing inside you,

13:45.058 --> 13:47.394
and you're trying to plug it up.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.496
But you got
to let that shit out.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.164
You got to let it flow.

13:51.198 --> 13:54.001
Otherwise you're gonna be in
agony for the rest of your life.

13:54.034 --> 13:56.836
So you're saying
that if I dance on the float,

13:56.870 --> 13:58.471
that maybe I'll find my pride?

13:58.505 --> 14:01.074
No. No, forget the float.

14:01.108 --> 14:03.443
That's just doing it
for the wrong reasons.

14:04.945 --> 14:06.779
You got to do something else.

14:10.717 --> 14:11.818
FRANK:
I got you a couple things

14:11.851 --> 14:13.220
from the float that you can use.

14:13.253 --> 14:14.754
I paid off the warden.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.756
They think they're seeing
a Blake Shelton concert,

14:16.789 --> 14:18.758
and I put your dad
in the front row.

14:18.791 --> 14:20.227
All right, I just...

14:20.260 --> 14:22.362
I just don't know
if I can do this, Frank.

14:22.395 --> 14:24.697
Mac, I don't get it,
and I may never get it,

14:24.731 --> 14:27.334
but I do know
you got to do this.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.370
You said you want
to tell your dad your way.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.873
So, now, do it.

14:33.907 --> 14:35.508
(exhales)

14:35.542 --> 14:38.245
Yeah. Yeah.

14:39.246 --> 14:40.213

14:40.247 --> 14:41.781
Hello, gentlemen.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.516
Dudes.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.085

14:45.118 --> 14:48.355
Blake Shelton
will not be making it today.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.524
-(all groaning)
-But, uh, he did send me
in his stead,

14:51.558 --> 14:54.294
and I've got something special
to show you.

14:54.327 --> 14:57.864
-Uh, my name
is Ronald McDonald, and...
-(laughter)

14:57.897 --> 15:01.134
(laughs):
I named him that.

15:01.168 --> 15:03.971
I got something
that I got to tell you, Dad,

15:04.004 --> 15:07.240
and I've been trying to find
the best way to do it, and...

15:07.274 --> 15:09.576
(sighs) I just thought
instead of saying it,

15:09.609 --> 15:13.580
maybe I could just show you
how I feel inside.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.151
Dad...

15:18.185 --> 15:20.187
I'm gay.
