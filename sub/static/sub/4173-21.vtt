used leftover parts.

an obstacle course this entire summer?

00:30.330 --> 00:30.830

I'm filled with remorse
that we haven't, of course,

00:33.500 --> 00:35.267
even thought of building
an obstacle course.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.703
Then let's build one and make
it our new tour de force.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.538

That does it.
It's busting time!

09:55.961 --> 09:58.830
Mother, may I please
speak with you?

gotten into you?

10:32.399 --> 10:33.464
Look!

10:33.832 --> 10:35.133
Hi, boys!
What?

10:35.534 --> 10:38.202
