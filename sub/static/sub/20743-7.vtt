In the village lived a man.

32:07.158 --> 32:09.388
He had a child, a girl.

wanted most in the world.

32:56.741 --> 32:59.335

He shot the man's wife.

Just give me two minutes.

39:17.788 --> 39:19.346
Please.

39:25.162 --> 39:27.153
How long have you known,

39:27.231 --> 39:28.960
exactly?

39:30.101 --> 39:32.399
Not until I saw the drawing on your fridge.

What made you think he killed Bridget?

The night she went missing,

my brother told my parents
he was at the movies,

39:42.847 --> 39:44.280
but he wasn't.

39:44.348 --> 39:46.942
He snuck back into the house late,

39:47.017 --> 39:51.249
and I remember seeing dirt on his clothes.

39:53.224 --> 39:54.919
Why didn't you say anything?

I don't know.

I was 13.

40:02.633 --> 40:04.965
I mean, he was my big brother.

40:05.035 --> 40:07.697
It would have made a difference, Jack.

- I didn't come looking for this.
- Bullshit.

40:22.686 --> 40:25.177
You knew exactly what you were doing.

40:29.627 --> 40:31.618

Ms. Millwright, we know that
you're working for Fausto Galvan.

42:38.622 --> 42:40.783
It was in Agent Froome's file.

Reassigned, to Latvia.

Now, why the distress call?

Let me tell you how this
is gonna work, Charlotte.

You're gonna tell me exactly
what I want to know,

43:08.118 --> 43:09.983
when I want to know it,

43:10.054 --> 43:13.615
or you're gonna do time
in a federal prison on drug charges.

43:13.691 --> 43:17.821
You are gonna help me
take down Fausto Galvan.
