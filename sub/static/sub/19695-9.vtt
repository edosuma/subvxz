00:00.667 --> 00:02.502
<i>Previously on "Shades of Blue"...</i>

00:02.527 --> 00:05.304
Sap, you're gonna have to
cover for me one more time.

00:06.152 --> 00:07.885
<i>Every day I'm alive I owe to you.</i>

00:08.128 --> 00:09.513
Anything you need, you got it.

00:09.600 --> 00:11.868
<i>The only family I got left is
in the hospital.</i>

00:11.933 --> 00:13.165
I'm gonna find out who put him there.

00:13.234 --> 00:15.334
Quince. Shot caller on Astoria.

00:15.403 --> 00:17.103
Maybe you ain't notice,
but baby girl here's

00:17.171 --> 00:17.970
packing an automatic.

00:17.995 --> 00:19.802
Baby girl ain't gonna light up a room

00:19.841 --> 00:21.217
with the little man watching,
now, is she?

00:21.242 --> 00:23.100
I'm writing a piece for the "Post."

00:23.169 --> 00:24.300
Think I can get an interview?

00:24.369 --> 00:26.045
Make all the judgments you want.

00:26.114 --> 00:29.081
It doesn't change the fact
that you're a dirty cop.

00:29.150 --> 00:31.584
You okay if I record this?
some unusual stories.

00:31.652 --> 00:34.773
<i>Well, there's the two murders
your dad covered up.</i>

00:34.842 --> 00:37.022
You really don't know your dad, do you?

00:37.588 --> 00:40.422
<i>Hi, Mr. Clark. This is Cristina Santos.</i>

00:40.491 --> 00:42.825
I was thinking maybe I could
help you with information

00:42.893 --> 00:44.410
to track down my dad.

00:44.435 --> 00:46.978
<i>If you hear from Miguel,
could you let me know?</i>

00:47.031 --> 00:49.553
When's the last time
you heard from Miguel?

00:50.246 --> 00:51.577
Hasn't bothered me in weeks.

00:51.646 --> 00:54.494
I guess God didn't grant me
enough serenity.

00:54.563 --> 00:56.739
Don't worry about it, man.
I brought some more.

00:59.175 --> 01:02.978
Tell me what 57-4-F has to do
with Detective Saperstein.

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

01:15.130 --> 01:17.531
This is Detective Santos
of the six-four.

01:17.599 --> 01:20.233
I have shots fired.
I repeat, heavy fire.

01:20.302 --> 01:23.236
Requesting immediate backup
and paramedics.

01:25.841 --> 01:28.909
Stay with me. Stay with me.
We're going for help.

01:28.978 --> 01:30.610
Officer down.

01:30.679 --> 01:34.010
I repeat: officer down.

01:44.421 --> 01:45.785
Got one of those for me?

01:45.854 --> 01:47.351
You know, a shower wouldn't hurt.

01:47.420 --> 01:49.480
Wash that FBI stench off.

01:49.982 --> 01:51.465
- Make a good impression.
- What's this?

01:51.533 --> 01:55.702
Transfer you asked for,
unless you don't want it.

01:56.915 --> 01:58.548
School Safety Division? Come on.

01:58.617 --> 02:00.850
Figured you be safer
with the middle school.

02:00.919 --> 02:03.406
Are you guys gonna tell me
how it is they let me go?

02:05.123 --> 02:07.490
- We took their milk money.
- Cute.

02:09.026 --> 02:12.529
Wonder if the FBI is gonna
send my pardon in the mail.

02:13.375 --> 02:15.098
Ceasefire anyway.

02:15.167 --> 02:18.601
Seriously? Think Stahl's backing down?

02:26.378 --> 02:29.445
- What'd you tell your mom?
- Oh, that the ferry was late.

02:29.514 --> 02:32.582
She can't know that I'm looking
for my dad.

02:32.651 --> 02:34.217
I mean, not that she'd
really notice anyway.

02:34.286 --> 02:36.631
She's been pretty busy lately.

02:38.161 --> 02:40.857
So she usually works
with the same detectives?

02:40.926 --> 02:42.534
Yeah, yeah.

02:42.559 --> 02:45.662
My own private collection
of crazy aunts and uncles.

02:46.202 --> 02:49.966
You must have pretty close
with David Saperstein then, huh?

02:50.712 --> 02:53.670
Uh, yeah. Yeah, that was horrible.

02:54.312 --> 02:56.294
My mom doesn't think I know
how much it's affected her,

02:56.363 --> 02:59.075
but it's never really been the same.

03:01.210 --> 03:03.714
So, um, is this why you called me?

03:03.783 --> 03:06.947
No, well, actually, I think
may have found a lead here.

03:07.241 --> 03:10.617
It's a piece of paper that...
some numbers scribbled on it.

03:10.642 --> 03:13.108
I found it in your father's belongings.

03:13.611 --> 03:15.545
I'm not sure what it could be.
I mean, it could be anything.

03:15.613 --> 03:19.143
Combination to a safe, an address...

03:20.084 --> 03:22.084
name is pretty clear.

03:22.153 --> 03:24.220
Might be a clue on how to reach him.

03:24.289 --> 03:25.321
Yeah, I don't know.

03:25.448 --> 03:27.456
I mean, you could ask
my grandmother if you want.

03:27.525 --> 03:29.525
Well, I was hoping maybe you
could help me with that.

03:30.157 --> 03:33.095
Perhaps you could talk
to Mrs. Saperstein.

03:33.164 --> 03:34.964
Uh...

03:35.833 --> 03:37.466
I'm sure she'd love to hear from you.

03:38.061 --> 03:40.069
She didn't really know my dad.
Neither did Sap.

03:40.138 --> 03:43.751
I mean, he died before Miguel got out...

03:43.776 --> 03:45.576
Yeah, but she might know what
these numbers mean.

03:45.645 --> 03:49.197
I don't... I don't think I want
to bother her with that.

03:49.849 --> 03:51.482
I mean, if my dad wants
to get in touch with me,

03:51.550 --> 03:53.651
he knows how.

03:55.221 --> 03:57.554
Where are you going?
I can give you a ride.

03:57.623 --> 03:59.657
No, I'm just gonna take a cab.

04:09.201 --> 04:11.101
If you don't mind me
saying so, Detective,

04:11.170 --> 04:14.305
you are looking particularly
ill at ease this morning.

04:14.373 --> 04:16.473
Loman, woman says you
know her as Baby Girl...

04:16.541 --> 04:18.235
is waiting for you at your desk.

04:18.314 --> 04:20.209
You pay him to say that
and make you look cool?

04:20.279 --> 04:21.445
I always look cool.

04:25.885 --> 04:28.719
Sit down and question me
or people gon' stare, man.

04:34.193 --> 04:35.626
Are you in trouble?

04:35.695 --> 04:37.628
Not me. My boy.

04:38.268 --> 04:40.237
The one in the doorway yesterday?

04:40.933 --> 04:42.833
That's Adrian.

04:42.902 --> 04:45.970
He's gone. I've looked everywhere.

04:46.843 --> 04:49.440
Dropped him off at school.
Something wasn't right.

04:49.508 --> 04:53.203
I could tell he was nervous,
but he wouldn't talk to me.

04:53.228 --> 04:56.897
He never made it to class.
My boy is in danger.

04:56.965 --> 04:57.964
I agree.

04:58.070 --> 05:00.700
His mother slings an assault
rifle for a drug lord.

05:00.769 --> 05:03.051
I do what I gotta do to survive.

05:03.806 --> 05:06.419
But I keep Quince away from my boy.

05:06.875 --> 05:08.778
If he know I was here,

05:09.203 --> 05:10.759
he would kill us both.

05:20.233 --> 05:24.524
Is this hat in hand
or we going for round two?

05:24.999 --> 05:27.327
Neither. Neighborhood kid went missing.

05:27.396 --> 05:28.595
I didn't get a call.

05:29.128 --> 05:31.431
His mother came to me off the books.

05:32.092 --> 05:33.558
She's part of Quince's crew.

05:33.627 --> 05:36.161
Kid may have been taken
by one of his rivals.

05:37.064 --> 05:41.132
I don't know this Quince.
This could be a setup.

05:41.201 --> 05:42.867
Kid's nine years old.

05:45.605 --> 05:48.673
All right, start at
his last known whereabouts

05:48.742 --> 05:50.487
and loop in the crew.

05:51.346 --> 05:52.711
Including Tufo.

05:53.111 --> 05:54.846
Tufo turned in his badge.

05:54.915 --> 05:56.882
I'm aware.

06:08.061 --> 06:10.562
Christina, I've got a deal for you.

06:10.630 --> 06:13.431
In exchange for this glorious
brunch coming your way,

06:13.500 --> 06:16.101
you get to move the car
to the other side of the street.

06:16.169 --> 06:18.203
I gotta get to school, Mom.

06:18.271 --> 06:19.635
Besides, you're a cop.

06:20.140 --> 06:21.906
You don't have to move the car
on ticket days.

06:21.975 --> 06:25.183
But I should be setting an
example, not abusing my power.

06:25.224 --> 06:27.357
Hey, eggs go on the toast.

06:27.426 --> 06:30.093
Which should be ready
by the time you find parking.

06:30.162 --> 06:32.629
I'm gonna be 25 by the time
I find parking.

06:32.698 --> 06:34.698
Guess I'll be eating your toast then.

06:34.766 --> 06:36.989
Hey, how much would this
ticket be anyway?

06:37.061 --> 06:39.128
- $65.
- So if I move the car,

06:39.197 --> 06:40.763
I get, like, half of that?

06:40.832 --> 06:42.932
I come back from work to cook
for my daughter

06:43.000 --> 06:45.668
and this is what I get? Negotiations?

06:48.802 --> 06:50.539
Willing to settle out of court.

07:24.628 --> 07:25.594
Pay for that, tough guy?

07:25.663 --> 07:26.929
That's called profiling, Loman.

07:26.997 --> 07:29.264
I didn't take you for that kind of cop.

07:29.333 --> 07:30.265
Suspect has multiple priors.

07:30.334 --> 07:31.932
So let him finish his muffin in peace.

07:32.001 --> 07:33.368
I would, but we got a problem.

07:33.401 --> 07:34.891
So it's you who's been
blowing up my phone

07:34.916 --> 07:36.579
like you want a second date, huh?

07:37.042 --> 07:38.574
Remember the girl from Quince's place?

07:38.642 --> 07:40.475
- The one with the kid?
- Yeah.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.169
The sister that pointed an AK at me,

07:42.216 --> 07:43.949
forced me to push up laundry day.

07:44.018 --> 07:45.183
That's the one.

07:45.252 --> 07:47.219
Listen, she came to me asking for help.

07:47.288 --> 07:49.656
Seriously, Mom, what's with the detour?

07:50.090 --> 07:52.157
I can't miss French. I'll get detention.

07:52.226 --> 07:54.293
- I had a dream last night.
- Yeah, me too.

07:54.361 --> 07:57.029
It was that I didn't get detention.

07:57.097 --> 07:59.321
Mine was about your dad.

08:00.445 --> 08:02.034
What was it?

08:03.203 --> 08:06.305
A memory. We came here once.

08:06.373 --> 08:09.007
- The three of us?
- Looking at the horses.

08:10.944 --> 08:12.144
Then the ride started.

08:12.212 --> 08:16.014
Your horse circled out of view
and you thought it ran away.

08:16.083 --> 08:17.883
Oh, God. Tantrum?

08:17.951 --> 08:20.519
Immediately.

08:20.587 --> 08:23.555
Then your father did something
I'll never forget.

08:23.624 --> 08:25.991
He took off running,
ran after your horse.

08:26.060 --> 08:29.094
By the time it circled back around,

08:29.163 --> 08:31.063
he was holding the reigns.

08:33.333 --> 08:36.201
He caught it for me?

08:36.270 --> 08:38.130
You know, in that moment,

08:39.173 --> 08:41.469
it all seemed possible.

08:41.909 --> 08:46.278
The life I wanted for you, for us.

08:46.347 --> 08:48.513
You made a pretty great life
for us, Mom.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.616
You know, even with everything
that he's put me through,

08:52.007 --> 08:54.419
sometimes I wish I could

08:54.488 --> 08:56.288
just say thank you.

08:56.357 --> 08:58.990
For that, and for this beautiful girl.

09:01.647 --> 09:03.428
Maybe one day you'll be able to.

09:03.497 --> 09:06.531
No. He's gone.

09:07.527 --> 09:09.868
And it's for the best.

09:09.937 --> 09:12.237
And I wouldn't even know where to look.

09:14.074 --> 09:15.577
I might.

09:15.976 --> 09:17.478
You might what?

09:18.045 --> 09:20.367
Know where to find out where Dad is.

09:20.948 --> 09:23.115
Or get a message to him, at least.

09:23.183 --> 09:25.039
Oh, has he contacted you?

09:25.064 --> 09:26.063
No.

09:28.692 --> 09:31.111
But I know someone who could help.

09:32.159 --> 09:33.696
Who's that?

09:35.028 --> 09:36.495
You're gonna be mad.

09:36.563 --> 09:38.296
Try me.

09:43.103 --> 09:47.072
Caddie, I'm gonna keep
calling you until you pick up.

09:47.141 --> 09:48.573
Listen to me.

09:48.642 --> 09:51.109
If a man you don't know,

09:51.178 --> 09:53.578
5'11", blond, lean,

09:53.647 --> 09:55.632
approaches you about anything,

09:55.701 --> 09:57.682
he's posing as a private investigator.

09:57.751 --> 09:59.618
Stay away from him.
Just get away from him.

09:59.686 --> 10:02.387
He is dangerous
and not who he says he is.

10:05.058 --> 10:06.258
Hey.

10:06.326 --> 10:08.762
It's gonna be a long stakeout.

10:09.096 --> 10:10.695
Your dad's working a case.

10:11.250 --> 10:13.198
The song of my youth.

10:13.267 --> 10:15.602
He didn't have a cell phone back then.

10:16.764 --> 10:18.570
This one's a face to face.

10:21.275 --> 10:22.288
Well, shouldn't you be

10:22.315 --> 10:24.242
spell-checking that article by now?

10:24.638 --> 10:26.551
Still deciding on an angle.

10:28.038 --> 10:30.078
Got more than I bargained for.

10:30.684 --> 10:32.038
Hey.

10:32.912 --> 10:34.453
Is it something I can help with?

10:37.009 --> 10:38.190
You guys have a problem.

10:44.264 --> 10:47.532
Hey, this school has
an antique security camera

10:47.601 --> 10:49.501
pointed towards the wall.

10:49.928 --> 10:51.570
Did you find anything useful?

10:51.999 --> 10:53.505
Teacher says he's a smart kid.

10:54.002 --> 10:55.373
- So the answer's no.
- No.

10:55.442 --> 10:57.108
Hey, uh...

10:57.534 --> 10:59.685
did you speak to your son today?

11:00.971 --> 11:03.215
The hell does that have to do
with anything?

11:03.283 --> 11:05.150
- Will do.
- All right, thank you.

11:05.219 --> 11:06.218
Hey, how'd it go?

11:06.243 --> 11:08.086
Did you remember how to secure
a witness statement?

11:08.155 --> 11:09.387
No, but I got some great school gossip.

11:09.456 --> 11:12.257
Adrian told one of his friends
he had to go to the Y.

11:12.326 --> 11:14.292
Gave him his homework to hand in.

11:15.562 --> 11:17.183
Caddie!

11:19.766 --> 11:21.600
Caddie, you in there?

12:16.709 --> 12:17.802
Tess, how we doing?

12:17.844 --> 12:19.010
He's losing consciousness.

12:19.078 --> 12:21.078
Just hold on, okay?

12:21.147 --> 12:22.913
We're close. We're so close.

12:22.982 --> 12:26.135
10-13, 10-13, en route
to Mercy Hospital.

12:26.191 --> 12:29.259
I have a GSW to the chest
and the abdomen.

12:29.328 --> 12:32.696
Losing lots of blood.
Have a trauma unit on standby.

12:36.535 --> 12:37.901
Harlee?

12:37.970 --> 12:39.603
Whoa.

12:47.451 --> 12:49.179
Overdose.

12:51.069 --> 12:53.190
Accidental?

12:54.231 --> 12:56.486
That would be the happy story.

12:56.805 --> 12:58.388
What's the likely one?

13:02.388 --> 13:04.628
My best friend got killed because of me.

13:04.697 --> 13:09.166
He was an addict.
He knew the end was gonna come.

13:09.437 --> 13:11.501
Not if he was forced to do it.

13:14.645 --> 13:16.606
I lied to my baby girl today.

13:18.621 --> 13:20.310
More than lied. I...

13:22.797 --> 13:25.366
I played her. I had to.

13:25.737 --> 13:28.104
All right, then you had to.

13:28.173 --> 13:30.297
But I know the way out.

13:32.477 --> 13:33.844
What is it?

13:33.912 --> 13:35.776
The truth.

13:36.248 --> 13:40.350
I know you, Harlee. Just tell me.

13:45.557 --> 13:47.958
I didn't pay Miguel to leave town.

13:48.026 --> 13:50.060
I mean, I did.

13:52.764 --> 13:54.931
But he showed up that night...

13:55.000 --> 13:57.467
you know, the night
that you were picked up.

14:00.138 --> 14:01.771
He broke into the house and...

14:01.840 --> 14:04.808
Harlee, whatever happened, it just...

14:04.877 --> 14:06.877
Don't say it's okay.

14:06.945 --> 14:09.412
Because it... it is not.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.616
And I don't want it to be.

14:18.328 --> 14:20.223
I killed him.

14:20.735 --> 14:22.559
He threatened me,
he threatened Christina,

14:22.628 --> 14:24.227
and I snapped his neck.

14:24.296 --> 14:28.098
You did what you had to do. Good!

14:32.303 --> 14:34.037
It's too much death.

14:41.376 --> 14:43.079
Nobody near me is safe.

14:44.981 --> 14:47.370
Except the ones you keep safe.

14:50.289 --> 14:51.558
Stahl knows.

14:52.296 --> 14:53.593
He's been talking to Christina,

14:54.160 --> 14:56.670
posing as some private investigator.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.778
Using her to get to me.

14:58.847 --> 15:00.647
Texting her like he's Miguel.

15:00.716 --> 15:05.185
It doesn't mean that he knows.
He's just desperate.

15:05.253 --> 15:08.221
Look, Harlee, I've been watching you.

15:08.290 --> 15:10.290
I've been looking for lies.

15:10.359 --> 15:12.993
But even I had no idea.

15:13.061 --> 15:14.627
There's more.

15:20.535 --> 15:23.169
Caddie helped me bury Miguel.

15:25.261 --> 15:27.273
He could have led Stahl
straight to his body.

15:31.102 --> 15:32.812
We'll fix this.

15:34.914 --> 15:36.249
He won't stop.

15:38.316 --> 15:40.253
We go to his boss.

15:41.008 --> 15:44.122
Without his shield, he has no power.

15:44.191 --> 15:46.944
He will never stop, Woz. Never.

15:48.736 --> 15:52.198
He is going to keep coming after me.

15:52.925 --> 15:54.401
Until I stop him.

15:56.996 --> 15:59.129
Harlee, no!

15:59.198 --> 16:00.097
Harlee!

16:00.489 --> 16:01.832
I won't let him
think he got away with this.

16:01.857 --> 16:03.934
Harlee, if you kill him,
the world will come

16:04.003 --> 16:06.136
crashing down on all of us,
just like you told me

16:06.205 --> 16:07.838
when I had my hands wrapped
around his throat.

16:07.907 --> 16:09.413
Yeah, I should've let you do it.

16:09.438 --> 16:11.241
- No, you shouldn't, though.
- He went after my girl.

16:11.310 --> 16:13.978
And he destroyed my marriage.

16:14.046 --> 16:16.613
But killing him isn't gonna help us.

16:16.869 --> 16:19.083
Right now, all I care about

16:19.151 --> 16:21.685
is that I am the last thing
that he ever sees.

16:21.754 --> 16:25.167
And you will be. But not right now.

16:25.691 --> 16:27.491
Promise me you're not gonna go there.

16:27.560 --> 16:31.128
- He deserves it.
- Harlee, you don't.

16:31.517 --> 16:33.718
Promise me, Harlee.

16:34.847 --> 16:36.734
I need to hear you say it.

16:40.573 --> 16:42.539
Well, done, guys. Let's go.

16:42.608 --> 16:44.304
- Loman.
- Yeah?

16:44.378 --> 16:46.278
- Where we at?
- Nothing yet.

16:46.346 --> 16:49.848
Wozniak got a call from Harlee,
took off, gave no specifics.

16:50.389 --> 16:53.185
- Tufo?
- Searching upstairs, no?

16:53.253 --> 16:54.920
Good.

16:54.988 --> 16:57.322
You want to confess to
something, arrest a priest.

16:57.391 --> 16:59.524
But don't ever talk to a reporter.

16:59.593 --> 17:01.932
Especially not Woz's son.

17:02.066 --> 17:03.298
I didn't make anything up.

17:03.367 --> 17:06.435
Oh, is that what you're gonna
tell Woz when he finds out?

17:06.502 --> 17:09.503
Because I doubt he's gonna be
moved by your integrity.

17:09.573 --> 17:11.973
Yeah, well, as long as it's still there.

17:12.041 --> 17:14.343
You are missing the point.

17:14.411 --> 17:15.911
What you want is to do good.

17:15.980 --> 17:17.746
You want the bad guys to go to jail.

17:17.815 --> 17:19.480
You want the world to feel right again.

17:19.505 --> 17:21.849
Bad guys should go to jail.

17:21.919 --> 17:25.219
Then your world is never
gonna feel right again.

17:25.955 --> 17:27.700
You wanna know why, Loman?

17:30.218 --> 17:31.618
Because I killed an unarmed man.

17:31.687 --> 17:34.287
Wrong. Try again.

17:40.095 --> 17:42.929
Because I got away with it.

17:42.998 --> 17:44.514
Yo, you two ladies shooting hoops

17:44.539 --> 17:47.367
- or do you wanna find this kid?
- No, us ladies, we multitask.

17:47.436 --> 17:49.169
One of the instructors recognized Adrian

17:49.237 --> 17:50.718
from their chess club.

17:51.725 --> 17:53.273
Yeah, his teacher said he's a smart kid.

17:53.342 --> 17:54.485
Too smart, apparently.

17:54.510 --> 17:56.743
He graduated to the big games
at McKinley Park.

17:56.944 --> 18:00.246
- You think he would go there?
- Hey, it's worth a shot.

18:04.820 --> 18:06.853
We good, Loman?

18:43.917 --> 18:46.084
Hey, how'd you beat us here?

18:46.153 --> 18:48.653
12:00. Next Bobby Fisher.

18:49.063 --> 18:50.922
I got two boys. I can handle it.

18:50.991 --> 18:52.857
He's playing chess, not checkers.

18:52.926 --> 18:54.025
I got him.

18:54.094 --> 18:55.593
Why don't you guys get his mother?

18:59.399 --> 19:01.399
Is it okay if I sit here?

19:01.468 --> 19:04.336
I got a rock in my shoe.

19:04.404 --> 19:06.805
Oh, it's killing me.

19:08.108 --> 19:10.342
I'm pretty good at this game.

19:10.410 --> 19:13.078
I'm actually scary, scary good at it.

19:13.146 --> 19:15.647
You wouldn't wanna play
somebody like me.

19:20.141 --> 19:22.554
All right. Let's see.

19:23.248 --> 19:25.156
Let's see how good you are.

19:26.802 --> 19:28.468
Do you want me to spot you a castle?

19:28.537 --> 19:31.271
- No, thanks.
- No?

19:31.606 --> 19:33.440
You want me to take it easy on you?

19:33.509 --> 19:36.376
- No.
- No?

19:36.445 --> 19:38.478
Are you gonna take it easy on me?

19:38.547 --> 19:42.315
No.

19:42.384 --> 19:44.985
Then we got a fair fight going, huh?

19:45.053 --> 19:48.155
I prefer checkers then chess.

19:50.532 --> 19:52.966
Oh! That's right.

19:53.499 --> 19:55.869
I don't like the horses anyway.

19:56.771 --> 19:58.538
Your move.

19:59.050 --> 20:00.833
Is your name Adrian?

20:01.610 --> 20:03.243
It is.

20:03.311 --> 20:05.879
My name's Matt. It's nice to meet you.

20:06.594 --> 20:09.716
You weren't supposed to look in
this bag here, were you?

20:10.258 --> 20:12.018
But you did, didn't you?

20:13.475 --> 20:15.021
Yeah?

20:18.867 --> 20:20.160
It's your move.

20:20.228 --> 20:21.895
Hey!

20:22.471 --> 20:24.371
Where's my other horse?

20:24.440 --> 20:26.440
Right here.

20:29.178 --> 20:30.577
Adrian! Adrian!

20:31.175 --> 20:33.275
Oh! Oh, my God, my baby!

20:33.300 --> 20:34.399
That was quick game, Woz.

20:34.468 --> 20:36.735
You wanna pretend that you let him win?

20:36.803 --> 20:39.204
- Only if you back me up.
- What'd I miss?

20:39.273 --> 20:40.539
Woz lost to a nine-year-old.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.707
Who had a bag full of Fentanyl.

20:42.776 --> 20:45.377
- Now we know who's pushing it.
- Quince?

20:45.445 --> 20:46.912
He used the kid to transport
the product.

20:46.980 --> 20:49.714
What kind of a scumbag uses
a nine-year-old as a drug mule?

20:49.783 --> 20:51.850
One who deserves what he's gonna get.

20:51.919 --> 20:55.420
If we arrest Quince,
my brother goes down too.

20:55.489 --> 20:58.231
- He'd be in jail before sunset.
- I'll think of something.

20:58.300 --> 21:00.725
- I can't lose him again.
- What'd I just say?

21:02.229 --> 21:04.129
Anyone ever messed
with my kid like that,

21:04.198 --> 21:06.131
I would drop 'em without even blinking.

21:21.815 --> 21:25.050
_

21:30.958 --> 21:34.226
_

21:34.294 --> 21:37.028
_

21:39.066 --> 21:41.866
_

21:41.935 --> 21:45.737
_

21:47.841 --> 21:53.557
_

21:57.863 --> 22:00.731
So how's your day?

22:01.320 --> 22:03.233
Improving.

22:20.309 --> 22:21.610
Going through the boss's desk.

22:22.513 --> 22:24.045
You know, he'd want me
to have you arrested.

22:24.778 --> 22:27.749
Then he'd have to bail me out,
which would mean showing up.

22:27.818 --> 22:30.986
- You must be the wayward son.
- You must be Nancy Drew.

22:31.283 --> 22:32.483
Oh, is that what they're calling me?

22:32.508 --> 22:34.375
Gotta protect my sources.

22:38.841 --> 22:39.873
You know, if I recall,

22:39.942 --> 22:41.708
Nancy Drew had a very high
conviction rate.

22:41.777 --> 22:42.943
Hey.

22:43.012 --> 22:44.108
I've, uh...

22:44.133 --> 22:46.580
Got 15 minutes now if
you want do do that interview.

22:49.084 --> 22:50.751
All right, yeah, if it's gotta be now.

22:50.820 --> 22:52.119
You don't look enthused.

22:52.188 --> 22:54.087
Detective Loman here is a genuine hero.

22:54.156 --> 22:58.091
Adds a dash of respectability
to the unit.

22:59.128 --> 23:00.394
Could we have the room, please?

23:00.462 --> 23:01.929
Of course, he does have issues

23:01.997 --> 23:04.097
with our brand of justice on occasion.

23:04.166 --> 23:05.833
Isn't that right, Detective Loman?

23:05.901 --> 23:08.135
I'd say you should schedule
your own interview.

23:08.204 --> 23:09.979
I'm a much better listener.

23:10.506 --> 23:14.107
Oh, by the way, that picture...
in the second drawer.

23:14.176 --> 23:15.409
He'll notice.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.751
Been calling you all day.

23:24.820 --> 23:26.688
Yeah, sorry I never got back to you.

23:26.757 --> 23:28.655
I was doing some research.

23:28.724 --> 23:30.224
I'm gonna need that tape.

23:30.851 --> 23:33.026
Brace yourself for disappointment.

23:41.151 --> 23:42.317
<i>I shouldn't have said those things.</i>

23:42.386 --> 23:44.195
<i>- I know.
- None of that can be printed.</i>

23:44.264 --> 23:45.620
No, that tape has all of my interviews.

23:45.689 --> 23:46.705
I'm not giving it to you.

23:46.732 --> 23:48.240
Then be liberal with the erase button.

23:48.240 --> 23:50.974
You know, you and my dad seem
to have quite the history.

23:54.591 --> 23:55.990
It's complicated.

23:56.059 --> 23:58.447
<i>Yeah, it didn't
seem complicated yesterday.</i>

23:58.515 --> 23:59.694
<i>You were pretty clear.</i>

23:59.719 --> 24:01.383
Your dad can be
a piece of work; you know that.

24:01.452 --> 24:05.436
But some days he can surprise you.

24:05.504 --> 24:06.956
How?

24:08.038 --> 24:09.971
How did he surprise you today?

24:32.295 --> 24:34.028
Quince went in five minutes ago.

24:34.097 --> 24:34.929
How'd you get him here?

24:35.445 --> 24:37.432
I told him Adrian came home on his own.

24:37.501 --> 24:39.334
He can't know I went to you.

24:39.402 --> 24:41.870
He thinks I found Adrian by myself.

24:46.143 --> 24:48.076
But he wanted to meet
to pick up the bag,

24:48.145 --> 24:50.345
so I suggested pancakes.

24:50.834 --> 24:52.847
Did you know?

24:53.295 --> 24:56.050
- What, about the drugs?
- Mm-hmm.

24:56.119 --> 24:57.367
No.

24:57.654 --> 24:59.087
Adrian ever run a shipment before?

24:59.156 --> 25:01.823
- Not that I know of.
- You're his mother.

25:03.793 --> 25:05.793
Did you even know he played chess?

25:11.285 --> 25:13.568
You know, that was me.

25:13.908 --> 25:17.002
Surrounded by the game,
close to getting lost in it,

25:17.070 --> 25:18.540
but I had someone looking out for me.

25:18.608 --> 25:20.909
Saved my life. Hey.

25:21.654 --> 25:24.512
Either get involved or get un-involved.

25:26.891 --> 25:28.947
No sense to anything in between.

25:33.781 --> 25:36.212
Yo. She know the game plan?

25:36.292 --> 25:38.359
Yeah. Corner booth, he came alone.

25:43.826 --> 25:46.234
Wake up, woobie. Come on.

25:47.237 --> 25:48.903
This wasn't in here before.

25:51.385 --> 25:53.552
Yo, if we arrest Quince for what he did,

25:53.621 --> 25:56.054
you'd have to testify, both of you.

25:56.123 --> 25:58.357
You want him to stay inside.

25:58.425 --> 26:01.103
A weapons charge ensures that.

26:01.695 --> 26:03.128
All right?

26:19.847 --> 26:22.635
Next time I tell you to do
something, you do it.

26:33.894 --> 26:35.627
He's heading out back.

26:35.696 --> 26:37.629
I got eyes on it.

26:44.605 --> 26:45.971
Gotcha.

26:54.548 --> 26:56.887
I'm sure you know how this works.

26:56.956 --> 26:58.469
That bitch set me up, didn't she?

26:58.519 --> 27:00.742
One thing running drugs.
It's a whole other thing

27:00.767 --> 27:02.467
when you make a little kid do it.

27:33.099 --> 27:35.133
Come near my daughter again,

27:35.724 --> 27:37.702
and nobody will ever find you.

27:38.577 --> 27:41.303
If she wasn't here,
I would've already killed you.

27:43.184 --> 27:44.717
This is disappointing, Robert.

27:44.786 --> 27:47.586
And unfortunately,
not entirely surprising.

27:47.655 --> 27:49.789
I'm working an angle.

27:49.857 --> 27:52.021
On whom? A high school girl?

27:53.094 --> 27:54.126
Your assignment is Ayres.

27:54.195 --> 27:56.324
I needed to find a way in.

27:57.031 --> 27:58.764
Even if it's an unconventional one.

27:58.833 --> 27:59.732
I think you'll find this to be

27:59.801 --> 28:02.400
more illegal than unconventional.

28:03.404 --> 28:05.471
The only measure is success.

28:05.540 --> 28:07.406
Not for the Bureau.

28:07.475 --> 28:09.275
You're gonna wanna wear
your best suit tomorrow

28:09.343 --> 28:10.743
for your disciplinary hearing.

28:10.812 --> 28:13.279
I'm gonna need your phone, Stahl.

28:14.842 --> 28:17.183
All of your assignments are
hereby suspended

28:17.251 --> 28:18.684
until further notice.

28:18.753 --> 28:21.620
I'd go, before I tell Harlee
she can hit you again.

28:23.747 --> 28:26.425
I don't ask for permission.

28:26.494 --> 28:29.028
You'll ask for mercy.

29:03.744 --> 29:05.076
<i>Mrs. Saperstein?</i>

29:07.756 --> 29:10.069
Special Agent Robert Stahl.
I'm with the FBI.

29:10.722 --> 29:13.808
- Do you have a moment?
- Not for you.

29:13.895 --> 29:16.496
Mrs. Saperstein, I was trying
to help your son that day.

29:17.132 --> 29:18.264
He didn't understand that,

29:18.333 --> 29:20.500
and now I am investigating his death.

29:20.568 --> 29:23.803
And if that sounds unfair,
it's because it is.

29:24.378 --> 29:26.572
But I'm not gonna let him down again.

29:30.500 --> 29:33.479
Never made sense, how that day went.

29:33.963 --> 29:35.699
That was not my David.

29:36.643 --> 29:39.085
It was not our intention to scare him.

29:39.154 --> 29:41.454
But we suspect there were
unusual circumstances

29:41.523 --> 29:43.256
surrounding your son's death.

29:43.803 --> 29:46.586
I'm really hoping you can
help me clear some of that up.

29:48.066 --> 29:50.329
He was very reserved about his work.

29:51.187 --> 29:55.368
Did he have a safe or
a safety deposit box, maybe?

29:56.051 --> 29:57.402
Are you kidding?

29:58.827 --> 30:00.973
David didn't save money.

30:02.192 --> 30:04.263
He was always buying me things
I didn't need,

30:05.187 --> 30:07.978
fixing things around the house
that still worked.

30:11.543 --> 30:15.045
Do the numbers 57-4-F
mean anything to you?

30:16.634 --> 30:18.807
That has nothing to do
with my son's death.

30:20.998 --> 30:22.383
Well, you know, just...

30:22.395 --> 30:25.175
we can't rule anything out.

30:25.845 --> 30:27.364
You can rule this out.

30:28.834 --> 30:30.800
It's the plot where he's buried.

31:01.390 --> 31:03.207
What is this, an intervention?

31:04.345 --> 31:06.184
Oh, we gave up on you
a long time ago, Tufo.

31:06.253 --> 31:07.728
Did you get summoned too?

31:07.797 --> 31:09.697
Just so you'd have a date.

31:12.835 --> 31:14.037
Mm!

31:14.106 --> 31:16.704
Oh, my God. What madman invented
this pickle juice thing?

31:16.772 --> 31:18.572
I don't know, but it works.

31:18.641 --> 31:21.069
If this is a surprise party, you got me.

31:21.138 --> 31:25.012
Oh, for you,
it's all surprise, no party.

31:25.081 --> 31:26.880
Woz is waiting for you
in the living room.

31:26.949 --> 31:28.716
Come on, Loman. Let's go bro you up.

31:28.784 --> 31:31.348
Nah, I have plans for these brain cells.

31:31.417 --> 31:33.587
Come on, Loman.
I'll hold your hair back.

31:58.114 --> 31:59.546
Let's go. You're blocking me in.

31:59.615 --> 32:01.582
Settle down, cranky.

32:01.651 --> 32:03.484
Gotta hear the score
before I hit the tunnel.

32:03.552 --> 32:07.988
- Your score can wait.
- So can you. Two seconds.

32:17.533 --> 32:19.867
<i>Swings and a miss! Oh, man!</i>

32:19.935 --> 32:20.801
Move your car.

32:20.826 --> 32:23.003
You let a little kid steal your knight?

32:23.072 --> 32:25.105
Before I even knew what was happening.

32:25.174 --> 32:27.679
- Kid showed no mercy.
- None, none whatsoever.

32:27.748 --> 32:29.665
I was toast. Yeah.

32:29.665 --> 32:32.532
So this is where you tell me
it's not my fault

32:32.601 --> 32:34.768
when Quince names my brother
in his statement?

32:34.837 --> 32:36.336
No.

32:39.441 --> 32:43.643
This is where I tell you
that I took care of it.

32:43.712 --> 32:45.212
What's this?

32:45.280 --> 32:47.547
It's an agreement for Wallace to act

32:47.616 --> 32:49.516
as my confidential informant.

32:49.585 --> 32:51.852
Effective as of his release.

32:51.920 --> 32:56.556
Anything that he's done,
he did because I told him to.

32:56.625 --> 33:00.594
All inadmissible.
Quince can't touch him.

33:04.266 --> 33:06.168
Thank you, Woz.

33:06.602 --> 33:11.838
Hey, next time you're parked
outside for a bust,

33:12.225 --> 33:14.408
turn off your engine.

33:14.476 --> 33:18.578
If Quince was on his game,
he would've made you.

33:18.647 --> 33:19.729
Yes, sir.

33:21.717 --> 33:24.684
Least, that's how a cop
would've done it.

33:36.331 --> 33:38.532
I got all the stuff in the trunk.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.400
I tarped the inside as best I could.

33:40.469 --> 33:43.804
Yeah, let's go outside.
I wanna talk to you about that.

33:53.315 --> 33:54.881
Hey, Nate!

33:54.950 --> 33:56.750
What are you doing ringing the bell for?

33:56.819 --> 33:58.685
I didn't realize you'd have company.

33:58.754 --> 34:01.555
Oh, we have the interview today.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.006
Come on in, come on in.
Can we just talk outside?

34:03.075 --> 34:05.819
No, no, no, come on.
Come on, we'll do it now.

34:06.295 --> 34:08.594
Sit down. I'll get you a drink.

34:08.664 --> 34:11.898
Boy, it's been a while since
you've been here with everybody.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.567
Where's Mom?

34:13.635 --> 34:15.969
She's out to dinner with her friends,

34:16.038 --> 34:17.704
avoiding the riffraff.

34:17.773 --> 34:20.306
Here. Cheers.

34:20.375 --> 34:22.239
Have a seat.

34:32.254 --> 34:35.554
I know this is your area of expertise,

34:35.623 --> 34:38.725
but isn't it, like,
you ask me a question and...

34:38.793 --> 34:40.293
Are you gay?

34:46.301 --> 34:49.235
The hell kind of icebreaker is that?

34:49.304 --> 34:51.492
Mom told me there was someone else.

34:51.974 --> 34:53.907
And I saw the photo of
you and Donnie on the boat.

34:53.976 --> 34:55.408
So that's where your head goes?

34:55.476 --> 34:57.010
I spent my whole life
trying to figure out

34:57.079 --> 34:58.945
what the hell I was doing wrong,

34:59.014 --> 35:00.947
why Annie was your perfect angel,

35:01.016 --> 35:02.916
even though she was a drug addict.

35:02.985 --> 35:05.522
She was ill. She had problems.

35:05.591 --> 35:07.988
Yeah, she had a thousand problems, Dad.

35:08.056 --> 35:11.770
She lied to you, she stole
from you, she broke your heart.

35:11.839 --> 35:13.093
I was the one who tried.

35:13.162 --> 35:14.961
I could've been a closer for the Yankees

35:15.030 --> 35:16.463
and it wouldn't matter.

35:16.532 --> 35:18.865
- No, it would've.
- No, it wouldn't.

35:18.934 --> 35:20.131
Because every time you look at me,

35:20.156 --> 35:22.836
you see something
you hate about yourself.

35:22.905 --> 35:25.472
You're my son. And I love you.

35:25.541 --> 35:28.842
- Yeah, then tell me the truth.
- You're my son.

35:28.911 --> 35:31.226
And I love you.

35:32.825 --> 35:36.113
But if you ever bring this up again,

35:36.585 --> 35:41.021
it'll be the last conversation
you and I ever have.

35:45.761 --> 35:48.662
Yeah, is that a punishment or a reward?

35:56.738 --> 35:58.838
- Get down!
- Woz, Woz, get down!

35:58.907 --> 36:00.006
Get down!

36:01.743 --> 36:03.510
Woz, get down!

36:03.579 --> 36:05.478
Woz, what are you doing?

36:05.547 --> 36:06.846
No, no!

36:06.915 --> 36:08.014
Woz!

36:09.084 --> 36:10.750
No!

36:19.761 --> 36:21.027
Harlee, stay there!

36:21.096 --> 36:22.696
- Woz!
- No!

36:22.764 --> 36:23.730
Get down!

36:23.799 --> 36:25.257
We gotta get him to the hospital.

36:25.282 --> 36:28.068
- I'll call it in.
- No, now! Give me your gun!

36:28.136 --> 36:29.869
Woz, no, you can't!

36:29.938 --> 36:33.006
Just get him there! Do you understand?

36:33.075 --> 36:34.541
Yeah?

36:34.610 --> 36:37.877
Keep your head down. Okay, go.

36:37.946 --> 36:39.412
Ahh!

36:40.616 --> 36:42.849
Tufo!

36:42.918 --> 36:46.286
Give me the 12 gauge from the pantry!

36:48.924 --> 36:50.824
Harlee, get down!

36:52.594 --> 36:54.594
This is Detective Santos
of the six-four.

36:54.663 --> 36:57.697
I have shots fired. heavy fire.

36:57.766 --> 37:00.433
Requesting immediate backup
and paramedics.

37:01.970 --> 37:03.036
Officer down.

37:03.105 --> 37:05.872
officer down.

37:05.941 --> 37:08.074
Give me that, Tufo!

37:14.016 --> 37:16.016
Are they to the car yet?

37:18.854 --> 37:20.053
Almost.

37:22.691 --> 37:24.691
They're in. They're in!

37:28.797 --> 37:29.729
Lieutenant, what are you doing?

37:29.798 --> 37:31.665
Making sure they're getting out.

37:31.733 --> 37:33.066
Sir, don't do it!

37:47.903 --> 37:49.402
- Christina.
- Where is she?

37:49.809 --> 37:51.771
She's in with the doctor.
Nothing serious.

37:51.840 --> 37:54.074
She just has some cuts
on her back from broken glass.

37:58.307 --> 38:00.113
I'm sorry. Come on.

38:00.182 --> 38:01.599
Come sit down.

38:02.851 --> 38:04.084
Where's Woz?

38:19.601 --> 38:21.601
Nurse says your boy's a fighter.

38:23.071 --> 38:25.705
It's gonna be a few hours til we
know the extent of the damage,

38:25.774 --> 38:28.041
but he's stable.

38:29.745 --> 38:32.212
Why don't you go sit with the crew?

38:34.049 --> 38:35.482
Okay.

38:35.551 --> 38:37.135
Hey, Loman.

38:37.719 --> 38:39.286
Thanks for that cover.

38:40.589 --> 38:43.124
Only supposed to work for a few seconds.

38:43.892 --> 38:45.792
Woz, what you did...

38:48.463 --> 38:50.583
We only made it out because of you.

38:51.543 --> 38:52.599
Mm.

38:52.668 --> 38:54.301
Then I did my job.

38:54.369 --> 38:57.071
We're gonna get the people who did this.

38:58.006 --> 38:59.239
All right?

39:04.813 --> 39:07.080
Yes, I will.

39:24.800 --> 39:27.067
Sweetie, what are you doing in here?

39:27.135 --> 39:30.103
My mom almost didn't make it home today.

39:30.172 --> 39:32.739
Figured I owed a prayer or two.

39:36.211 --> 39:38.845
Your mom will always make it home.

39:38.914 --> 39:40.273
That's a promise.

39:41.083 --> 39:43.417
Why don't we go to church anymore?

39:43.952 --> 39:46.119
I still remember all the songs.

39:46.188 --> 39:48.822
I bet.

39:49.725 --> 39:52.659
Loudest voice in the
congregation at three years old.

39:52.728 --> 39:54.628
You're deflecting.

39:58.967 --> 40:02.068
Oh, baby, I see a lot of pain,
a lot of tragedy.

40:02.137 --> 40:04.237
I just...

40:04.306 --> 40:07.107
got hard to hear that

40:07.175 --> 40:09.776
it was all part of a big plan.

40:12.498 --> 40:14.497
So what do you believe in?

40:15.217 --> 40:17.150
I believe in you.

40:18.464 --> 40:20.305
Do you trust me?

40:20.656 --> 40:23.690
Of course. You doubt that?

40:23.759 --> 40:25.121
No.

40:25.961 --> 40:27.994
I saw you at the school today.

40:30.065 --> 40:31.765
I was...

40:31.833 --> 40:34.834
just had to drop off some paperwork.

40:34.903 --> 40:35.802
For the loan.

40:38.497 --> 40:42.609
Did you get in touch with William Clark?

40:43.178 --> 40:46.112
I meant to, okay? I will.

40:46.589 --> 40:50.383
Just... the days get long and...

40:53.255 --> 40:56.856
This was a tough one.

40:56.925 --> 40:58.692
Yeah.

41:00.762 --> 41:03.029
I'm really glad it's over.

41:06.034 --> 41:07.400
Me too.

41:15.110 --> 41:17.377
It's okay.

41:18.280 --> 41:20.814
We're okay.

41:24.152 --> 41:25.318
<i>No!</i>

41:28.056 --> 41:29.389
