00:00.083 --> 00:02.085
<i>Last season on</i> Awkward...

00:02.251 --> 00:03.462
Nobody can know that I like you.

00:03.628 --> 00:04.713
This came in the mail for you.

00:04.879 --> 00:06.423
Jenna, you could disappear
and no one would notice.

00:06.589 --> 00:07.925
"A Friend".

00:08.090 --> 00:10.427
Sometimes, being a teenager
makes you want to die.

00:10.593 --> 00:11.887
Aspirin take me away.

00:12.929 --> 00:15.599
- Our daughter is suicidal.
- I didn't try to kill myself.

00:15.765 --> 00:17.809
The looser wants us
to talk about her.

00:17.975 --> 00:20.228
- I love that girl.
- Better hide the knives.

00:20.394 --> 00:23.190
- What is the fascination with me?
- You have some serious backbone.

00:24.107 --> 00:27.194
- I really like you.
- You're in an open relationship?

00:27.360 --> 00:30.656
- Who the fuck invited you?
- I did.

00:30.822 --> 00:32.698
He's taking you public.
Outing you as a couple.

00:32.865 --> 00:34.868
Are you and Matty together?

00:35.034 --> 00:36.745
Looks like
Matty invited a lot of people.

00:37.412 --> 00:39.581
- You have to be home right away?
- I have a few hours to kill.

00:39.747 --> 00:41.959
I'm not gonna hook up with Matty again
until we DTR'd.

00:42.229 --> 00:44.586
- What are you talking about?
- Define the relationship.

00:44.752 --> 00:46.880
You promised not to hook up again
without clarity.

00:47.046 --> 00:48.108
You better get it soon,

00:48.233 --> 00:50.113
before you're dumpster
humping without a safety net.

00:50.501 --> 00:53.553
- Are we together?
- You're not the object of his affection.

00:53.719 --> 00:55.898
- You're easy to talk to.
- I was just thinking the same thing.

00:56.725 --> 00:59.726
- You think Matty knows Jake kissed me?
- No way, guys don't talk.

00:59.892 --> 01:01.186
- I kissed Jenna Hamilton.
- What?

01:01.477 --> 01:04.730
So you can sleep with me in private,
but you can't talk to me in public?

01:04.897 --> 01:07.609
Figure out what you want Matty,
because I'm tired of being your secret.

01:07.775 --> 01:09.861
I'm so glad I wrote you that letter.

01:10.027 --> 01:11.446
Jake can't be trusted.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.616
You'll never gonna be able to control
the things that happen to you, sweetheart.

01:14.782 --> 01:17.035
But, you'll be able to control
how you feel.

01:17.201 --> 01:19.246
The reason that
I keep bringing up our kiss

01:19.412 --> 01:20.330
is because I like like you.

01:20.607 --> 01:23.458
I was just nominated
for sophomore winter formal princess.

01:24.458 --> 01:25.585
Ah, you just missed her.

01:25.751 --> 01:27.957
And Rosati was the guy
you've been telling me about.

01:28.082 --> 01:29.214
Yep, Jake's my date.

01:29.380 --> 01:30.590
I think you're right.

01:30.756 --> 01:31.591
It's too late.

01:34.045 --> 01:34.928
Mom?

01:36.637 --> 01:37.814
It was the night before Christmas

01:37.939 --> 01:39.716
and all through the house,

01:39.841 --> 01:41.051
not a creature was stirring...

01:41.176 --> 01:42.602
Except for my mouse,

01:42.768 --> 01:45.272
which wasn't wireless or working
and driving me insane,

01:45.438 --> 01:47.724
because even my keyboard
was acting inane.

01:48.024 --> 01:51.428
Using pluses for "t"s,
exclamations for "I"s,

01:51.553 --> 01:53.739
I hoped Santa would bring
a laptop surprise.

01:54.356 --> 01:56.566
Either pixels or print
my blog would be fine,

01:56.691 --> 01:59.669
but I needed a break
to start thinking offline.

01:59.794 --> 02:02.205
Thinking about what I found
post the dance.

02:02.330 --> 02:04.775
Thinking how I found it by chance.

02:04.900 --> 02:07.177
I finally unveiled
who had scripted the letter.

02:07.302 --> 02:09.503
It was someone I knew...
Who should've known better.

02:09.920 --> 02:10.881
Not Lissa,

02:11.047 --> 02:11.715
not Ming,

02:11.881 --> 02:13.717
not Tamara, not Sadie,

02:13.883 --> 02:16.620
not Matty, not daddy,

02:16.745 --> 02:21.047
but the lady who made me.

02:23.517 --> 02:27.297
So for over a week,
I debated my action.

02:27.422 --> 02:28.999
Would I forgive or forget?

02:29.124 --> 02:31.835
Or focus on...
Distraction?

02:31.960 --> 02:33.670
Like decorating five dozen cookies

02:33.795 --> 02:37.440
with sugar and spice.

02:37.565 --> 02:40.277
Or watching every movie
on pay-per-view.

02:40.402 --> 02:42.279
Twice.

02:42.404 --> 02:45.115
And when all else failed
to preoccupy my mind,

02:45.240 --> 02:47.417
I would help Jake Rosati
work on his grind.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.820
This is frustrating.
Maybe we should...

02:49.945 --> 02:51.621
- Take off our clothes?
- Or go inside.

02:51.746 --> 02:54.257
Before my dad gets suspicious.

02:54.382 --> 02:56.092
Right.

02:56.217 --> 02:57.627
It's getting late, I should go.

02:57.752 --> 03:00.363
Only if you promise to open
my Christmas present tonight.

03:00.488 --> 03:01.417
Ohoh. Where can I find it?

03:01.542 --> 03:03.016
You should look for something
arriving via email.

03:03.182 --> 03:04.183
Oh.

03:06.741 --> 03:07.593
[Computer dings]

03:07.718 --> 03:09.606
Considering vacation days
were like dog years,

03:09.772 --> 03:12.400
Jake and I were already on
the verge of common law status.

03:12.566 --> 03:14.611
So making us online official

03:14.836 --> 03:15.946
seemed like a formality.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.914
And yet, I was afraid.

03:18.039 --> 03:21.051
Would Jake still accept me
if he knew my own mother didn't?

03:21.176 --> 03:22.536
I need clarity and an...

03:22.777 --> 03:23.703
Explanation?

03:24.212 --> 03:26.540
Why do you need an explanation?

03:26.815 --> 03:27.624
I'm not a douchebag.

03:27.849 --> 03:29.918
- Am I?
- No.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.003
But the jury was still out
on my mother.

03:32.169 --> 03:34.089
Well, looks like we're all
wrapped up here, so...

03:34.255 --> 03:36.216
Not so fast.

03:36.382 --> 03:39.970
I have one more gift for you.

03:43.931 --> 03:46.268
Oh, you missed the card.
Here.

03:47.306 --> 03:48.937
"This is who you are."

03:53.524 --> 03:56.486
I never want you to forget
how precious you are to me.

03:56.611 --> 03:59.122
I couldn't.
She put it in writing.

03:59.247 --> 04:01.575
Of the carefrontation kind.

04:01.741 --> 04:02.951
Thanks.

04:03.551 --> 04:05.161
This is something to remind you

04:05.494 --> 04:07.487
how precious you are to me.

04:20.718 --> 04:22.095
.- how should I dress tonight?

04:22.261 --> 04:23.383
Sexified.

04:23.508 --> 04:25.282
It's new year's Eve
<i>and</i> you have a date,

04:25.407 --> 04:27.559
which means you're guaranteed
to swap saliva.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.486
The only thing I'm guaranteed
is a Prozac attack.

04:29.611 --> 04:31.588
I can't believe Ricky's
holed up in Havasu

04:31.713 --> 04:34.482
with his grandma
when we're finally commit legit.

04:34.648 --> 04:35.692
Oh, you guys DTR'ed?

04:35.858 --> 04:37.460
He sexted me a picture of his hand

04:37.585 --> 04:39.696
with a note that says, "we miss you."

04:39.862 --> 04:41.615
That pretty much sums it up.
We're together.

04:41.781 --> 04:44.301
Now, you, you need an outfit
that plays up your assets.

04:44.426 --> 04:46.202
Oh! Borrow something from your mom.

04:46.327 --> 04:47.829
Guaranteed she has something
to boost your bitties.

04:47.995 --> 04:50.206
I'm not sure my mom's style
sends the right message...

04:50.331 --> 04:51.775
With words or clothes.

04:51.900 --> 04:53.944
I still hadn't told tee
that my mom wrote the letter.

04:54.069 --> 04:55.478
I hadn't told anyone,

04:55.603 --> 04:57.047
'cause I didn't want anybody
to hate my mom

04:57.172 --> 04:58.131
until I figured out if I did.

04:58.297 --> 05:00.417
- Hello?
- I'll figure something out.

05:00.542 --> 05:01.718
See you soon.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.653
Where you going?

05:03.778 --> 05:06.156
A party.

05:06.281 --> 05:07.349
Well, your dad and I were just gonna

05:07.515 --> 05:10.961
- take you to a movie.
- Sorry.

05:11.086 --> 05:13.797
- Are you going with Jake?
- Yep.

05:13.922 --> 05:15.332
- Is he a good kisser?
- Mom!

05:15.731 --> 05:19.202
Well, it wasn't that long ago
I was your age.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.304
You can talk to me...
About anything.

05:21.737 --> 05:24.341
I wasn't ready to talk
until I figured out what to say.

05:24.466 --> 05:26.676
So the only way to get my mom
out of my hair

05:26.951 --> 05:28.044
was to do it.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.622
I gotta do my hair.

05:30.788 --> 05:33.708
- Need help?
- Nope.

05:33.874 --> 05:36.002
If I was a paranoid person,

05:36.168 --> 05:38.505
I would say that
you're trying to avoid me.

05:38.671 --> 05:39.723
Why would you think that?

05:39.848 --> 05:41.057
[Turns blow-dryer on]

05:41.382 --> 05:42.559
Well, for starters,

05:42.684 --> 05:44.469
you've been really distant
the last two weeks.

05:44.635 --> 05:46.429
I can tell when something's
eating you up,

05:46.554 --> 05:48.723
and I think I know what it is.

05:48.889 --> 05:51.201
I detected something missing,

05:51.326 --> 05:54.070
and realize you must've seen it.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.106
This is really hard for me to say,

05:56.231 --> 05:57.240
so I'll just come out with it.

05:57.731 --> 05:59.042
She was about to confess.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.320
I noticed you and Jake
weren't online official.

06:04.196 --> 06:06.282
It takes a while for boys to commit.

06:06.407 --> 06:09.577
Which is why you have
to manipulate them into it.

06:10.578 --> 06:11.913
Do you know his password?

06:12.079 --> 06:13.373
[Turns blow-dryer higher]

06:15.458 --> 06:17.360
In four short months, I had evolved.

06:17.485 --> 06:19.295
I'd gone from that girl
who tried to kill herself

06:19.420 --> 06:21.798
to that girl who had a date
on new year's Eve.

06:22.381 --> 06:24.734
But for some reason,
new Jenna still couldn't shake

06:24.859 --> 06:26.303
feeling like the old one.

06:43.477 --> 06:47.346
"What's left to be resolved?"

06:48.382 --> 06:51.694
Happy new year!
Ha ha.

06:51.819 --> 06:53.663
Hi, hi.
Welcome.

06:54.330 --> 06:56.166
I hadn't spoken to Matty
since the dance,

06:56.291 --> 07:00.370
and I was worried
that seeing him would be...

07:00.495 --> 07:02.072
Weird.

07:02.197 --> 07:03.440
Well, what are you waiting for?

07:03.797 --> 07:06.009
Let's get a drink in your hand.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.552
Debrief. Now!

07:07.969 --> 07:09.541
Matty didn't even flinch.

07:09.666 --> 07:11.097
He just jet skied passed
his heartache.

07:11.263 --> 07:13.767
Yeah, those fist bumps
were not pained.

07:13.933 --> 07:15.643
Okay, I got the memo.
He's fine, but I'm not.

07:15.809 --> 07:18.271
Someone's reading my blog.
I got a comment tonight.

07:18.437 --> 07:20.607
- How?
- It's on a public site.

07:20.773 --> 07:21.524
I knew it.
Which one?

07:21.690 --> 07:22.484
It doesn't matter now.
I hid it.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.110
Why'd you make it public
in the first place?

07:24.276 --> 07:26.362
I don't know!
I didn't really think about it.

07:26.487 --> 07:28.164
It was anonymous...
Sort of.

07:28.289 --> 07:29.199
So it's not one of you guys?

07:29.365 --> 07:30.833
Like you wouldn't know if it was me.

07:30.958 --> 07:34.204
- I can't keep a secret for [bleep].
- True.

07:34.729 --> 07:35.789
So do you think it's someone we know?

07:35.955 --> 07:38.174
Most likely,
it's some creepy old perv.

07:38.299 --> 07:39.667
- Like Peng Huang.
- Who?

07:39.833 --> 07:42.379
My dad.
I found porn on my laptop.

07:42.545 --> 07:43.679
[Gasp] Ew!

07:43.804 --> 07:46.132
Your dad tickles his pickle
on your...

07:46.298 --> 07:47.683
Judge all you want, but at least n

07:48.008 --> 07:51.287
I have leverage...
Sort of.

07:51.412 --> 07:53.156
I'm still getting picked up
before midnight.

07:53.430 --> 07:55.158
So while you all kiss each other,

07:55.283 --> 07:56.459
I'm gonna be kissing my pillow.

07:56.809 --> 07:58.895
With your dad's jolly juice.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.147
On that visual, I'm getting a drink.

08:01.313 --> 08:02.857
Hi!

08:03.023 --> 08:04.234
Look, it's a new year,

08:04.400 --> 08:06.194
and I wanna clear the air,

08:06.360 --> 08:09.238
start fresh, and repent for my sins.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.540
Jenna!

08:10.665 --> 08:11.866
I've sinned against you.

08:13.617 --> 08:14.702
And I'm sorry.

08:14.868 --> 08:16.830
Great.
I accept your apology.

08:19.290 --> 08:21.584
But I mean, I did
really awful things to you.

08:21.917 --> 08:23.586
I told everyone you were a whore.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.355
Did you start the "Hamilton's
a whore" group online?

08:26.672 --> 08:28.391
As of tomorrow, it's coming down.

08:28.716 --> 08:31.160
Great, thanks.
I forgive you.

08:31.285 --> 08:32.528
- Good talk.
- Oh.

08:32.885 --> 08:36.097
You seem a little off balance.

08:36.222 --> 08:37.517
And I think I know why.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.703
At first, I considered it
temporary insanity

08:40.828 --> 08:42.905
when you locked me
out of the bathroom.

08:43.030 --> 08:45.741
But since you haven't responded
to any of my calls or texts,

08:45.866 --> 08:49.979
I can only conclude you're
bordering on insubordination.

08:50.104 --> 08:52.782
That said, I'm over it.

08:52.948 --> 08:54.325
You're forgiven.

08:54.491 --> 08:56.999
- You threatened to shave my head.
- This is what we do.

08:57.550 --> 09:00.945
You step out of line,
and I smack you down.

09:01.070 --> 09:03.084
Then you get me a latte.

09:03.250 --> 09:05.094
Well, not this year.

09:05.219 --> 09:08.531
So you're willing
to be friends with Hamil-toe

09:08.656 --> 09:10.399
- and not me?
- Exactly.

09:10.524 --> 09:14.937
By the way, you look skinny.

09:15.062 --> 09:17.974
That is something
a friend would say, bitch!

09:18.099 --> 09:19.542
The powder was so fresh, man.

09:19.975 --> 09:23.012
Except on the backside
when I bailed down some ice.

09:23.137 --> 09:24.447
Best snowboarding of my life.

09:24.572 --> 09:26.115
- Wish I could've been there.
- No doubt.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.550
So what'd you do over the break?

09:27.675 --> 09:29.452
Oh, not much.
Just chilled.

09:29.577 --> 09:32.421
- Oh, with Hamilton?
- A little.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.699
You guys together now?

09:34.865 --> 09:37.076
[Phone rings]

09:39.495 --> 09:41.831
Uh, no, we're not official
or anything.

09:41.956 --> 09:43.566
Just been hanging out.

09:43.999 --> 09:46.202
- Hello?
- Hey, girl!

09:46.327 --> 09:48.571
Just wanted to say happy NYE!

09:48.696 --> 09:50.806
Valerie?
Is everything okay?

09:50.931 --> 09:52.592
You've never called my cell before.

09:52.758 --> 09:55.244
Well, Jenna,
there is a first for everything.

09:55.369 --> 09:57.079
A first for calling your best girl,

09:57.204 --> 09:58.247
a first for being stood up.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.284
- Were you stood up?
- No! No, God, no.

10:01.409 --> 10:02.952
I meant, in the handicapped sense

10:03.077 --> 10:05.321
when someone has to lift someone
else out of a wheelchair.

10:05.771 --> 10:08.057
Anyway, where are you
celebrating tonight?

10:08.182 --> 10:09.625
Uh, I'm a Matty McKibben's.

10:10.109 --> 10:13.279
Right.
New year's is for lovers.

10:13.445 --> 10:15.490
- I'm here with Jake.
- Are you sure that's a good idea?

10:15.656 --> 10:17.300
I mean, someone might get
the wrong impression,

10:17.425 --> 10:18.284
like I had a date.

10:18.559 --> 10:20.954
- Valerie, I have to go!
- Why!

10:21.120 --> 10:25.208
Look, I let the cat out.

10:26.866 --> 10:28.711
Need some help?

10:28.836 --> 10:30.179
Sure.

10:30.304 --> 10:31.339
So did you have a good holiday?

10:31.505 --> 10:34.817
- Yeah, it was great. You?
- Yeah.

10:34.942 --> 10:37.720
So... I know I probably don't
have to say this,

10:37.845 --> 10:41.349
but I'm really sorry about
what happened at the dance.

10:42.349 --> 10:44.660
I'm hoping we can be friends
once we get some closure.

10:44.785 --> 10:46.963
Not that I'm suggesting
that you need closure.

10:47.312 --> 10:48.564
But...

10:48.731 --> 10:51.000
I do.

10:51.125 --> 10:53.528
So... are we closed?

10:54.528 --> 10:56.281
No.

11:01.935 --> 11:03.204
I want another chance.

11:06.081 --> 11:08.876
{pub}- You want another chance?
- I know I made a lot of mistakes.

11:09.671 --> 11:12.005
- But I won't screw up again.
- I came with Jake.

11:12.171 --> 11:13.006
But you can stay...

11:14.256 --> 11:14.908
With me.

11:15.033 --> 11:16.718
It's not that easy.

11:16.884 --> 11:17.911
I know you haven't forgotten
about me, Jenna,

11:18.036 --> 11:18.761
or you wouldn't be here right now.

11:18.927 --> 11:21.514
It was true.
I hadn't forgotten about Matty.

11:21.680 --> 11:23.600
But I also hadn't entirely
forgiven him.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.184
Jake said you guys
were just hanging out.

11:25.350 --> 11:27.059
He'll understand once we explain it.

11:27.184 --> 11:28.737
- We?
- Or me.

11:30.038 --> 11:30.648
I'll tell him.

11:34.017 --> 11:35.929
Okay, just meet me here
at midnight...

11:36.054 --> 11:38.781
And we'll start over.
And don't worry about Jake.

11:38.947 --> 11:40.867
He'll understand once...
He knows.

11:43.260 --> 11:45.872
Once he knows what?

11:45.997 --> 11:48.241
That I was with you first.

11:48.366 --> 11:50.476
Technically, Matty was with me first.

11:50.601 --> 11:52.712
And technically,
Jake and I weren't official.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.681
But if everything came down
to technicalities,

11:54.806 --> 11:56.282
I was technically confused.

11:56.407 --> 11:58.176
I'm confused too.

11:58.342 --> 12:00.136
When did you ask her
to be online official?

12:00.302 --> 12:02.347
Almost a week ago.
And she hasn't even responded.

12:02.513 --> 12:03.489
[Scoffs]
Puh-lease.

12:03.614 --> 12:04.757
Ricky's left my request in cyberspace

12:04.882 --> 12:06.434
for, like, three months.

12:06.684 --> 12:08.161
- I should really ask him why.
- Do it now.

12:08.286 --> 12:09.662
Get a little resolution
before the new year.

12:09.787 --> 12:11.264
He's with his grandma.

12:11.897 --> 12:14.657
Well, if that's true,
then she's looking pretty good.

12:16.026 --> 12:20.156
Ricky!
You lying sack of crap!

12:21.490 --> 12:24.410
I better lie in wait nearby
to deal with the aftermath.

12:25.903 --> 12:27.455
Ooh! Hey, stranger.

12:27.621 --> 12:29.332
Where've you been?

12:29.498 --> 12:30.884
I accidentally let the cat out.

12:31.009 --> 12:33.127
I don't think Matty has a cat.

12:33.293 --> 12:34.253
Any more.

12:34.419 --> 12:36.122
Which is...
Even more reason to find it.

12:36.247 --> 12:37.557
It has already been forgotten.

12:37.682 --> 12:39.192
And what about you?
Have you forgotten?

12:39.317 --> 12:41.194
- Forgotten what?
- To respond to my request.

12:41.319 --> 12:42.829
Oh, right!
I was totally gonna do that.

12:42.954 --> 12:45.932
Right after I found the cat.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.767
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty!

12:47.892 --> 12:48.518
Kitty!

12:48.684 --> 12:50.570
[Gasp] Kitty?
Kitty?

12:50.695 --> 12:52.739
Is there a kitty?
[Gasp] I <i>love</i> kitties.

12:52.864 --> 12:56.009
Meow.
Kitty? Meow.

12:56.525 --> 12:59.362
- Meow!
- Get up, there's no cat.

13:00.521 --> 13:02.573
- So I've been thinking.
- <i>It was a first</i>.

13:02.739 --> 13:03.658
I know how we can be even.

13:03.824 --> 13:05.243
- We are even.
- No, no.

13:05.409 --> 13:07.587
I'm talking old testament even.

13:07.712 --> 13:09.289
It's called an eye for an eye,

13:09.414 --> 13:12.292
but we're gonna make it
a cheek for a cheek.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.327
I slapped you,
so you have to slap me.

13:14.452 --> 13:17.296
- Uh-uh, I'm not gonna slap you.
- Come on, slap me!

13:17.462 --> 13:20.500
[Gasp]
Wow, I didn't even feel that.

13:20.625 --> 13:21.935
Beautiful, I swear,

13:22.060 --> 13:24.262
my grandma dropped me off early
to surprise you.

13:24.428 --> 13:27.014
Call her.
She'll confirm my story.

13:27.180 --> 13:28.056
Your story?
[Chuckles]

13:28.181 --> 13:30.560
You just admitted
that you're making this up.

13:30.726 --> 13:32.478
Eat [bleep], Ricky.

13:34.021 --> 13:37.358
15 minutes to midnight!

13:37.575 --> 13:39.485
They were 15 minutes
that I would never forget.

13:39.776 --> 13:43.089
Jake needed acceptance,
Matty needed an answer,

13:43.214 --> 13:46.159
and I needed some air.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.152
[Car horn honking]

13:53.123 --> 13:55.134
I'm here to help you
with your crisis.

13:55.259 --> 13:56.636
You know about my crisis?

13:56.761 --> 13:58.713
With your cat.
Don't worry, we'll find her.

13:59.397 --> 14:01.374
Or is it a him?
Tomcats can be a little tricky.

14:01.499 --> 14:04.744
Which is why I brought
reinforcements.

14:04.869 --> 14:06.612
Val...
The cat's imaginary.

14:06.737 --> 14:08.848
So is my relationship.

14:08.973 --> 14:10.249
Oh!

14:10.374 --> 14:12.118
"J," I am tore up from the floor up,

14:12.243 --> 14:13.486
beat up from the feet up,

14:13.611 --> 14:15.455
and I need a check up
from the neck up.

14:15.580 --> 14:17.106
Alok stood me up.

14:17.272 --> 14:19.025
I'm sorry to lay this on you
but Susan's out of town.

14:19.150 --> 14:20.093
Who's Susan?
Your therapist?

14:20.218 --> 14:21.928
No, my psychic.

14:22.053 --> 14:24.097
I'm not good at following
my own intuition

14:24.222 --> 14:25.665
when it comes to relationships,

14:25.790 --> 14:27.133
so I need her guidance.

14:27.258 --> 14:28.501
And there's no way
to reach her by phone?

14:28.626 --> 14:30.103
At that moment,

14:30.228 --> 14:31.404
I could've used a little
guidance from Susan myself.

14:31.529 --> 14:34.240
No, she won't give out her cell.

14:34.365 --> 14:35.775
Oh, "j"...

14:35.900 --> 14:37.343
I feel like such a tool.

14:37.468 --> 14:39.979
Alok said he wanted to ring in
the new year together,

14:40.104 --> 14:43.216
so I bought a new dress
and I got my hair done.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.718
And now it's unraveled.

14:45.843 --> 14:50.223
No. It's still intact.
But my heart isn't.

14:50.348 --> 14:53.993
- He didn't even call you?
- No, he did a few times.

14:54.118 --> 14:55.528
But... I don't know.

14:55.653 --> 14:57.530
I just... I don't wanna hear
his excuses, you know?

14:57.655 --> 14:59.699
I've heard 'em all before.
My ex had a million of 'em.

14:59.824 --> 15:01.484
Who bangs their head
and has to go to the doctor?

15:01.650 --> 15:05.304
There was no blood.
Just a bump and blurred vision.

15:05.429 --> 15:07.940
He could've just said he didn't
wanna see <i>stars on ice.</i>

15:08.065 --> 15:11.778
Val, this is your ex,
not Mr. Mishra, right?

15:11.903 --> 15:14.547
Yeah.

15:14.672 --> 15:17.583
You can't let your past
disappoint cloud your judgment.

15:17.708 --> 15:20.086
It's holding you back.

15:20.211 --> 15:22.622
And maybe my past disappointment
was holding me back too.

15:22.747 --> 15:25.124
- I just didn't know from who.
- I should call him.

15:25.249 --> 15:27.860
Do it.

15:27.985 --> 15:31.597
Get out of my car.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.123
Happy new year's!

15:35.267 --> 15:37.637

16:11.495 --> 16:14.997
1.

16:41.416 --> 16:43.240
{pub}What are you doing alone in here?

16:46.801 --> 16:48.913
Um, getting drunk.

16:49.038 --> 16:50.147
I just got denied.

16:50.509 --> 16:53.817
Ah, let me guess.
Jenna Hamilton.

16:53.942 --> 16:56.787
Yeah.
How'd you know?

16:56.912 --> 16:58.722
It's [bleep] obvious.

16:58.847 --> 17:01.125
You've been drooling
over the freak for months.

17:01.250 --> 17:02.626
Why? I'll never know.

17:02.896 --> 17:06.797
You probably have
some sort of savior complex.

17:06.922 --> 17:08.299
So what happened?

17:08.424 --> 17:11.473
Did she dis you again
for the nilla wafer?

17:12.627 --> 17:14.271
Yup.

17:14.396 --> 17:18.075
And now I've been relegated
to second string.

17:18.200 --> 17:21.078
Just tell me, how do I just
watch from the sidelines?

17:21.623 --> 17:23.614
- Get a therapist.
- Come on, sades.

17:23.739 --> 17:25.348
- I need to talk.
- Then talk.

17:25.473 --> 17:26.921
But not to me.

17:27.443 --> 17:30.421
Why?

17:30.546 --> 17:33.290
Are you so dense that you can't see

17:33.415 --> 17:36.460
that I have had
a crush on you forever?

17:36.585 --> 17:39.229
And now you want me
to make you feel better

17:39.354 --> 17:42.333
because you finally tasted
the bitter pill of rejection?

17:42.458 --> 17:43.634
Well, I won't.

17:43.759 --> 17:47.149
Welcome to my club.
It's a lonely, sad, dep...

17:55.303 --> 17:57.448
So... what are your resolutions?

17:57.573 --> 18:00.484
I didn't know.
There were too many to process.

18:00.609 --> 18:03.354
This year, I'm not even
gonna say his name.

18:03.479 --> 18:06.056
Ricky's dead to me.
Oh, damn it!

18:06.181 --> 18:08.125
I just said Ricky.
[Bleep]!

18:08.670 --> 18:12.963
This year, I'm gonna
let Jesus take the wheel.

18:13.088 --> 18:16.233
'Cause I'm way too drunk to drive.

18:16.358 --> 18:17.680
Ow!

18:17.846 --> 18:20.104
This year, I'm gonna be on top.

18:20.229 --> 18:24.174
Unless I'm in
a monogamous relationship.

18:24.299 --> 18:28.379
I just decided I'm not gonna
make any resolutions.

18:28.504 --> 18:30.537
I'm just gonna
let the year surprise me.

18:34.942 --> 18:39.146
Oh... my... God.

18:42.370 --> 18:44.695
Oh, my God.

18:45.248 --> 18:48.221
You've got to be kidding me.

18:49.957 --> 18:52.859
You're totally overrated.

18:54.595 --> 18:57.141
Or...

18:57.266 --> 18:59.109
Am I?

18:59.234 --> 19:02.135
This is my grandma.
Talk to her.

19:05.907 --> 19:10.354
Hello?
Yes, but...

19:10.479 --> 19:13.624
He did?

19:14.236 --> 19:15.459
He is a nice boy.

19:15.584 --> 19:18.157
You too.

19:19.699 --> 19:22.036
Oh! I should wash my mouth out.
I puked in the sink.

19:22.202 --> 19:24.257
Anybody have any gum?

19:26.456 --> 19:29.062
You, come here!

19:33.588 --> 19:35.007
- That was...
- Amazing.

19:35.237 --> 19:39.550
I know.
You're welcome.

19:39.675 --> 19:43.053
- You ready to go?
- Yes.

19:43.178 --> 19:44.588
I'm not letting you leave.

19:45.183 --> 19:47.524
Not until you...

19:47.649 --> 19:50.250
Happy new year.

19:51.319 --> 19:52.852
Thank you.

20:04.291 --> 20:05.901

20:06.026 --> 20:07.136
Mm-hmm.

20:07.261 --> 20:12.057
And, uh, thank you for the...
Condoms?

20:13.433 --> 20:15.256
Who got condoms for Christmas?

20:15.802 --> 20:17.049
Me.
They're from my dad.

20:17.215 --> 20:19.969
Wow!
Well, thank you, Mr. Hamilton.

20:20.207 --> 20:22.684
Looks like I'm about
to have a good year.

20:22.809 --> 20:23.889
Can't believe your dad
gave you condoms.

20:24.055 --> 20:25.654
Yeah, it's kind of his thing.

20:25.779 --> 20:27.017
He gave them to
the last guy I dated too.

20:29.302 --> 20:30.146
Oh.

20:34.775 --> 20:35.526
So you use 'em?

20:36.223 --> 20:37.319
Yes... no.

20:38.525 --> 20:40.325
Not any more, but I have.

20:43.930 --> 20:46.162
Cool.

20:46.328 --> 20:49.778
If it makes you feel
any better, I was in love...

20:49.903 --> 20:51.584
You know, when I used them.

20:51.750 --> 20:55.421
That doesn't make me feel any better.

21:03.583 --> 21:07.819
Do you want out?

21:10.389 --> 21:12.401
No.

21:12.526 --> 21:16.371
I'm all in.

21:16.496 --> 21:19.297
But are you?

21:21.300 --> 21:22.615
It was official.

21:22.781 --> 21:24.646
We had DTR'ed for the world to see.

21:24.771 --> 21:26.615
And I was letting go of my fear.

21:26.740 --> 21:28.817
My fear of rejection.

21:28.942 --> 21:31.019
Because I had nothing to hide.

21:31.144 --> 21:33.188
And even if only one virtual stranger

21:33.313 --> 21:34.690
knew the whole truth,

21:34.815 --> 21:36.124
it was time to go public

21:36.249 --> 21:39.115
with what I could
neither forgive nor forget.

21:41.455 --> 21:42.798
Yes.

21:42.923 --> 21:44.199
This came in the mail for you.

21:44.324 --> 21:47.769
And... she's finally doing her hair

21:47.894 --> 21:50.795
now that she has a boyf...

21:52.164 --> 21:55.231
Sarah, I gotta go.

22:01.694 --> 22:03.572
<i>This season on</i> Awkward.

22:03.738 --> 22:05.950
Bad news, dudes.
We've been TMZ'ed.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.326
Can you imagine
all the scandalous stuff

22:07.492 --> 22:08.327
that's been caught on tape?

22:08.493 --> 22:10.121
I am barely over my suicide stigma.

22:10.246 --> 22:12.289
I can't be known as the girl
who hooked up on tape.

22:12.455 --> 22:13.832
Now I have to tell Jake about Matty.

22:13.998 --> 22:15.542
Before he finds out the hard way.

22:15.708 --> 22:17.670
- Jenna, I don't like secrets.
- Secrets? What secrets?

22:18.024 --> 22:19.046
The guy you slept with.

22:19.212 --> 22:20.506
I'm totally jealous of him.

22:20.672 --> 22:21.632
I hate to admit this,

22:21.798 --> 22:23.592
but Matty might be trying
to home-wreck you.

22:23.758 --> 22:25.552
You think I'm trying to lure you
away from Jake?

22:25.718 --> 22:27.388
- Yes!
- You're crazy!

22:28.265 --> 22:30.349
You guys seen that girl
Matty's been hanging out with?

22:30.515 --> 22:31.517
- Yes...
- Yes...

22:31.683 --> 22:33.644
- Do you think she's attractive?
- Yes!

22:33.810 --> 22:35.229
- So, what's up with you two anyway?
- She's cool.

22:42.569 --> 22:44.280
We know you were in love with Matty.

22:44.446 --> 22:45.614
But when did you know?

22:45.780 --> 22:46.740
- After we had sex.
- Okay.

22:46.906 --> 22:48.575
You have to have sex with Jake,
then you'll know.

22:48.741 --> 22:50.786
I think we should have sex.

22:52.579 --> 22:54.109
Always be a lady in the street,

22:54.234 --> 22:55.874
quick in the shits,

22:56.040 --> 22:57.543
quiet over the P.S. System.

22:57.709 --> 22:59.253
You're going to church camp?

22:59.419 --> 23:01.213
If they tell you to drink
and take a nap,

23:01.379 --> 23:02.172
don't.

23:03.292 --> 23:05.884
- You're saved.
- I really need to clear my head.

23:06.050 --> 23:06.719
When I'm going to camp,

23:06.885 --> 23:09.247
it can't be fixed by stepping my past
in the wrong kind of time.

23:09.372 --> 23:12.224
<i>Timing, it was everything.
And my time had arrived.</i>

23:13.165 --> 23:15.820
As my best friend, if you knew something,
you'd tell me, right?

23:15.945 --> 23:16.395
Yeah.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.938
Say it. Say it.

23:18.104 --> 23:19.356
I think our timing is off.

23:19.522 --> 23:22.021
Maybe the timing's finally right.

23:22.734 --> 23:23.819
Are you gonna stroke out?

23:23.985 --> 23:25.195
Do you need a trauma blanket?

23:25.361 --> 23:26.113
You need to choose.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.449
Him, or me.

23:28.615 --> 23:31.410
