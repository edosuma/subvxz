does he have a house and child?

"Here I am. I'm apparently Jesus.

with an aspect of himself

we'll call the devil.

in the desert.

58:16.960 --> 58:19.660
and leaving me to take the fall for it.

58:19.760 --> 58:21.000
I'm not your brother.

58:24.000 --> 58:25.889
I've been doing all right.

58:29.960 --> 58:31.200
I haven't.

58:31.320 --> 58:35.245
I'm the 99 percent. It's tough out there.

58:36.040 --> 58:37.860
Only financially, of course.

58:37.960 --> 58:40.900
IQ, brother, that remains
John Stuart Mill level.

58:41.000 --> 58:42.500
Seriously, I was tested.

58:42.600 --> 58:44.460
Just before I didn't go into the Army.

58:44.560 --> 58:45.580
Congratulations.

58:45.680 --> 58:48.500
Yeah, it's complicated.
I didn't do a lot of things, brother.

58:48.600 --> 58:49.886
Look...

58:52.640 --> 58:54.940
There isn't a man out there
who wouldn't have shot

58:55.040 --> 58:57.771
that poor fucking federale.

58:58.440 --> 59:00.220
Not a person alive with half a brain

59:00.320 --> 59:02.940
would have reported it,
either, in your situation.

59:03.040 --> 59:05.100
You were being followed by me.

59:05.200 --> 59:08.540
I mean, obviously, it could have been me

59:08.640 --> 59:10.900
at the mouth of that cave,

59:11.000 --> 59:14.447
if that parky hadn't come by,
it would have been me,

59:14.560 --> 59:17.325
and I would have killed you.

59:17.840 --> 59:19.888
You should understand.

59:21.720 --> 59:24.121
And I am going to kill you.

59:24.720 --> 59:27.121
And you need it.

59:28.040 --> 59:31.601
Justice, brother, needs to be served.

59:32.360 --> 59:35.443
You shot a poor bastard in the desert,

59:35.560 --> 59:37.940
but, no, you can't tell anybody

59:38.040 --> 59:40.740
because you've got to be Elvis Beatle.

59:40.840 --> 59:43.260
You gotta control your own biography.

59:43.360 --> 59:48.940
You can't be confused or conflated
or co-mingled with the facts, brother,

59:49.040 --> 59:51.780
by certain disastrous facts,
certain realities.

59:51.880 --> 59:54.020
That's bad press for the show.

59:54.120 --> 59:59.081
So you cover it up
at expense of the human life.

01:00:02.200 --> 01:00:04.620
What do you want, 100 grand?

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:06.500
A fucking ticket to Greenland?

01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:10.380
Brother, in a negotiation, never be
the first man to mention a number.

01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:12.060
What do I want?

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.446
I want...

01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:18.008
what you want.

01:00:18.440 --> 01:00:23.207
But what neither of us
are gonna get... my life.

01:00:24.080 --> 01:00:27.980
My ability to do things, to be things.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.367
I don't want to be defined
by that sequence of accidents

01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:32.020
any more than you do.

01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:36.489
I want to move on, but only one of us
is gonna get to do that.

01:00:39.360 --> 01:00:41.740
You're thinking you should've
killed me in the desert,

01:00:41.840 --> 01:00:44.366
brother, yes, you should have.

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.060
Oh, I can always go to the cops
and tell them everything.

01:00:48.160 --> 01:00:51.660
(LAUGHS) No. No. That's no can do.

01:00:51.760 --> 01:00:55.380
It's too late, brother.
You've done felonies.

01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.723
You have covered up an act for which
you should've presented yourself

01:00:58.840 --> 01:01:00.220
to the nearest constable.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.563
You'd do time. You're not gonna do that.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.060
You show what you are,
everything you've got.

01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.446
All done.

01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:14.180
You'd have to say you were
psychologically unequal.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.965
(LAUGHS)

01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:20.380
Unequal, brother, to your duties
as a good citizen.

01:01:20.480 --> 01:01:23.740
You'd have to go apologize
on the public shame tour.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:29.620
"Whoops. I shot a fucking cop. Sorry.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:31.820
Please still let me make 10 million a year

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.208
irrespective of residuals and royalties."

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:39.220
You would have to admit to deficiencies,
this is the really funny part,

01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:41.900
deficiencies that you don't really have.

01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.500
I mean, I don't think you could
admit to the ones you do have,

01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:47.060
but I really try to imagine
you going anywhere

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.060
and saying that you're
a normal human being

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:51.220
that makes a normal
human fucking being mistake,

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:54.051
and I just know that's not gonna happen.

01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.369
So which one of us
is the sociopath, brother?

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:04.246
Hmm?

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:08.660
How many people did you kill

01:02:08.760 --> 01:02:12.128
or leave behind to get on your hill?

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:15.780
All those people rotting in your past.

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:18.180
Those teachers and alcoholic wrecks

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.140
you used to be friends with
or be in bands with.

01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.244
Are you still in touch
with anybody not useful?

01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:33.580
It's not my fault that I can do things
as an artist that you can't.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.780
Are you saying I can't?

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:38.180
Oh, I don't even know if you exist
as I understand existence.

01:02:38.280 --> 01:02:40.647
Let's talk story, brother.

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:43.740
I had an idea about the denouement

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:47.300
when I found the revolver,
dead guy's revolver.

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.200
I had an idea.
But we'll talk about that later.

01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:58.811
Thank you for your service.

01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:03.805
Put it on my chit.

01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:08.806
If you're so clever...

01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:13.370
why'd you take the gun?

01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.340
What?

01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:17.180
I'll say it to you very carefully

01:03:17.280 --> 01:03:20.284
because you're only
John Stuart Mill level.

01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.380
(CHUCKLES)

01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:23.780
You have the pistol belonging
to the dead parky

01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:26.780
and the broken piece of the rifle,
and I can reasonably maintain

01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:28.500
that I never met you
before this very minute.

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:30.090
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:03:30.200 --> 01:03:32.180
If I'm the Mojave murderer,
which there is a question about,

01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:35.340
why am I here if you
weren't in the Mojave?

01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.930
Oh, I was in the Mojave.

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.520
You found the registration
of the Land Cruiser I wrecked.

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.810
Yeah. Scenario one:

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:46.180
I never met you before in my life.
And I could go with that.

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.020
Scenario two: I did meet you before.

01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:50.940
You came to my camp to kill me
because that's what you do

01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.660
but I got the better of you then, brother,

01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:56.180
- which is the truth.
- (BURPS)

01:03:56.280 --> 01:03:59.409
But when I left the camp,
I left the rifle.

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.660
- Bullshit you did!
- Oh, I did.

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:06.321
And the last I saw you,
you were tracking me with the rifle.

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:07.980
And I got to the road.

01:04:08.080 --> 01:04:09.940
I may have heard a couple
shots off in the distance.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:12.088
And I thought it was a hunter,
so I caught a truck.

01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:13.660
Never saw you again until now.

01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.860
I didn't know anything about
seven murders in the Mojave.

01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:17.530
I'm a very busy man.

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.300
See, it plays, doesn't it?

01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.340
It would prevail.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:24.540
It's the fictional narrative
that makes the most sense.

01:04:24.640 --> 01:04:27.380
Whereas the real narrative
is a very hard sell.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:29.220
For example, genius,
you try and tell a cop

01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:31.180
that you found that dead parky's pistol

01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.220
in the base of my fucking television, try.

01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:37.660
You can't sell a story, brother,
in which someone else is the villain.

01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:40.764
You don't worry about
what is but what seems to be,

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.460
and what seems to be is what I've been

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.380
making a living at
since I was 18 years old.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:48.860
You worry about what
seems to be and not reality,

01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:52.089
because reality
is what I fucking say it is.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:58.325
You're carrying, brother?

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:01.325
So are you.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:04.768
How do you explain yours?

01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:08.641
Well, yours is a bit more
hot than mine, wouldn't you say?

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:12.140
Mine's a misdemeanor.

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:14.340
Or you came in with it.

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:16.044
You want to play?

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.127
- Two hundred grand.
- No.

01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:23.940
Just get the fuck out of Los Angeles.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.180
Use the gun on yourself.
I don't care what you do.

01:05:26.280 --> 01:05:28.420
Whatever you do or say,
I'm gonna get out of it,

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.204
and I'm almost sorry about that, brother,

01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.367
but that's the way it is.

01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:36.807
Get some sleep. You look like shit.

01:05:47.440 --> 01:05:49.363
Game on, brother.

01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.447
(LIVELY LATIN MUSIC PLAYING)

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:14.460
Hey. Look, if... if you're from those Korean
guys, this is not the way to do business.

01:06:14.560 --> 01:06:17.689
Relax, brother. It's just a little sleep.

01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:26.291
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:41.483
Um... it's the cops.

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.761
I'm Detective Beaumont.
This is Detective Fletcher.

01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:12.620
Nice house.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:15.451
Thanks. I haven't really moved in yet.

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:17.740
Are you married, sir?

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.171
No.

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:24.442
Yes. My wife and child,
they're in England.

01:07:24.560 --> 01:07:25.980
Why are they in England?

01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.082
They're English.

01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:31.485
Okay.

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:34.420
Your people were working late and verified

01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.380
that you were on the property all night

01:07:36.480 --> 01:07:38.580
- after the arrival of Ms. Leoni.
- Yes.

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.740
Ms. Leoni has an Italian name but she's...

01:07:40.840 --> 01:07:43.844
French.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:47.260
Why is everyone
in Los Angeles a foreigner?

01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.771
Money.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.490
So...

01:07:52.440 --> 01:07:55.125
because you were here
and there's verification,

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:57.220
we're not going to beat around the bush,

01:07:57.320 --> 01:07:59.780
and I will tell you,
as Detective Fletcher and myself

01:07:59.880 --> 01:08:01.180
look at you for your reaction,

01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:05.001
the unfortunate news that your partner,
Mr. Davenport, is dead.

01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.683
- Dead?
- Murdered.

01:08:13.560 --> 01:08:18.660
At about, um... 10:00 pm last night
according to his cell records.

01:08:18.760 --> 01:08:23.084
Mr. Davenport ordered a delivery
of Chinese food and a prostitute.

01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:24.460
A sex worker.

01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:27.140
Prostitute arrived
before the Chinese food,

01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:28.700
and when the prostitute arrived,

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:31.460
she found the front door
of the residence to be open

01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.460
and Mr. Davenport just inside the door,

01:08:34.560 --> 01:08:39.420
dead of what appears to be
massive blunt force trauma.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:42.899
It seems that Mr. Davenport
answered the door in a towel.

01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.300
Our people seem to think
that Mr. Davenport

01:08:45.399 --> 01:08:48.620
didn't suffer any defense wounds
because he was trying

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.051
to hold up his towel.

01:08:51.680 --> 01:08:55.500
Protecting yourself naked
can be a little problematic.

01:08:55.600 --> 01:08:58.206
There's a whole concept
of girding your loins.

01:08:58.319 --> 01:09:02.647
A naked man tends to protect his unit
rather than, as in this case, his head.

01:09:06.720 --> 01:09:07.881
Coffee.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.767
Mr. Davenport's house was ransacked,

01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:19.140
and his safe was found to be opened.

01:09:19.240 --> 01:09:23.899
Do you know if Mr. Davenport
kept large amounts of cash?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.300
I, uh...

01:09:26.399 --> 01:09:27.700
I have no knowledge.

01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:30.883
No, I... I think...

01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:34.540
that I wouldn't be surprised if he did.

01:09:34.640 --> 01:09:37.620
Firearms or drugs?

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.819
Never saw him with either.

01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:45.380
Um... you should understand
that I never knew him socially.

01:09:45.479 --> 01:09:48.779
Did you ever say to Mr. Davenport, um,

01:09:48.880 --> 01:09:51.884
"I will kill you, you fucking cocksucker"?

01:09:57.480 --> 01:09:59.380
Yes, I did.

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:01.420
Why?

01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.340
- He was a producer.
- Did you hate him?

01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.204
No. I liked him.

01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:14.884
I have to shut down post?

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:19.651
The estate's position
is they want to shut down, yes.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.820
Who are his heirs?

01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:23.580
He has one brother.

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.580
But he disappeared at Burning Man,

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.420
and no one has seen him
for about five months.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:33.162
So that's who owns my movie,
a disappeared burner?

01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:36.089
Essentially, yes.

01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:41.580
I have to be absolutely sure
that you do not have a cut

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.445
nor any footage whatsoever of the film.

01:10:45.240 --> 01:10:47.129
I do not have anything of the kind.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:51.620
If this property was searched, if I
have seized your personal hard drives?

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:53.740
You know what I want you to do
is pay a lot of money

01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.171
and find out I don't have anything.

01:10:55.960 --> 01:10:57.420
I'll take that on your word.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:58.806
Oh, I would.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.220
Not the head, brother. Not the head.

01:11:20.320 --> 01:11:22.049
Well, not too much in the head.

01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.380
What we say we are, is what we are.

01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.766
Now what we do.

01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:33.371
What we do is,
as you know very well, is accidents.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.580
It's all a bunch of mistakes, brother.

01:11:38.680 --> 01:11:41.811
Fuck, if I would have known who you were,
I would have asked you for a job.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.420
When you're working as an artist,
I mean, you know what I mean,

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:50.205
you only have blurs of realizations

01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:54.006
that you have an exterior life
that will be judged.

01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:59.740
When you're working,
everything is cobwebs.

01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:01.700
People are cobwebs.

01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.724
What did Shaw say?

01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:07.580
Shaw said a true artist

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:10.809
will make his grandmother drudge
for his living at 70.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:12.841
Ninety.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:20.769
Now is not the time to one-up
me on the quotes, brother.

01:12:21.360 --> 01:12:23.840
Now let's talk about what seems to be.

01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:30.620
Hair, blood.

01:12:30.720 --> 01:12:34.205
Maybe I already put some around the place,
on your clothes, maybe I didn't.

01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:38.809
There's a gun somewhere
that I beat your buddy to death with.

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.368
Everything you need
from mitochondrial DNA.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:44.460
Brains, brother.

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:47.100
Brains. So you're taken care of.

01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:49.521
You killed him if I say so.

01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.740
But you know I wouldn't have killed him
if he hadn't said something.

01:12:53.840 --> 01:12:55.524
- What did he say?
- Well, I'll tell you.

01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:57.300
He said the most unreasonable thing.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.721
He said that we could work it out.

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.690

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:12.500
Aren't you gonna tell me
like everybody else does

01:13:12.600 --> 01:13:15.171
that you're a married man?

01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:17.220
Huh?

01:13:17.320 --> 01:13:19.620
You have kids?

01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:21.500
People that love you, that you love?

01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.700
Aren't you gonna say any of that?

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.484
Offer me money?

01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:30.060
I've already done everything
I need to be remembered.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:32.891
How are you doing, brother?

01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.620
I read when I was two, man!

01:13:37.720 --> 01:13:39.220
I read when I was two!

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:42.580
And what the fuck did they do for me, huh?

01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:43.700
(COUGHING)

01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:47.930

married to my uncle.

Hamlet, man.

01:13:57.280 --> 01:13:59.140
He couldn't do it.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:01.620
He couldn't kill the king
with his sins on his head.

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.740
He couldn't kill him at his prayers.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:05.604
But I can.

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:09.771
Now I could kill you right here,

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:13.140
and that would be one end,

01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:16.060
but this started in the desert.

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.289
And it's gonna end there,
brother, you understand?

01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:21.966
This has to play out.

01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:27.845
It's never gonna be the cops, brother.

01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.900
They can't do the math.

01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:32.580
Just you and me in the desert.

01:14:32.680 --> 01:14:34.967
I'll be there. I know you will.

01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.085

So give me some truth.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.931
Do you know yet which one
of us is the bad guy?

Why'd you come?

01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:29.083
Because you won't stop.

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.060
No, I will not.

01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.700
I have nothing left.

01:17:33.800 --> 01:17:36.020

I don't wanna have to kill you here,
and then drag you somewhere else,

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:56.161
and then go kill your family, but I will.

- That's your problem.
- Mm-hmm.

your fucked-up childhood, are you?

No. I believe in infinite complexity.

Oh.

You said... that I was
a failure as an artist.

01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.100
I was a failure.

01:21:52.200 --> 01:21:53.540
I need you to understand this.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.165
I was a failure...

01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:01.445
through capacity, not incapacity.

01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:06.326

uncommunicable things,

01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:19.620
and there was no point.

01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:24.965
In other words,
the devil came to me, and I said yes.

01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:27.324
But he was lying.

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.330
Look at the coin.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:37.361
That coin lands on this table,
heads or tails,

01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:40.447
that's the man that goes first.

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:47.420
- You'll do it?
- You know I'll fucking do it.

01:22:47.520 --> 01:22:50.285
- Heads or tails?
- Tails.

01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:52.980
This coin lands eagle side up,

01:22:53.080 --> 01:22:55.060
you'll pick up that gun,
point it at your head,

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.004
- and pull the trigger?
- Don't fucking ask me how.

01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:43.122
- What'd the coin say?
- Doesn't matter.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.380
You would have never gotten the gun.

01:23:46.480 --> 01:23:50.380
I would have picked it up
to hand it to you.

01:23:50.480 --> 01:23:53.860
I would have shot you
in the face, brother,

01:23:53.960 --> 01:23:55.849
and burned you in the desert.
