00:02.036 --> 00:04.372
RUSH: This is what Destiny
 intended from the moment
 it entered the star system.

00:04.405 --> 00:08.007
YOUNG: That ship
 is the best chance
 we have of getting home.

00:08.042 --> 00:11.079
Are we done?
 We'll never be done.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.313
(GRUNTING)

00:12.346 --> 00:13.281
WRAY: You shouldn't have
 left him on the planet.

00:13.314 --> 00:15.049
YOUNG: You think
 I don't know that?

00:15.083 --> 00:16.684
CHLOE: Everyone thinks
 we're safe.

00:16.717 --> 00:18.852
They think that
 they'll never find us again.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.654
Why did you take
one of our people prisoner?

00:20.688 --> 00:22.190
(SNARLS)

00:22.223 --> 00:23.891
CHLOE: We're not safe,
 are we?

00:23.924 --> 00:25.826
TELFORD: They're coming!
 Who's coming?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.428
Lucian Alliance.
 They're coming to
 take Destiny.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.830
RUSH: There's only one way
 this is going to end
 if we wait.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.699
YOUNG: I'm not surrendering
 this ship.

00:31.732 --> 00:33.901
CHLOE: Once I've
 changed completely,

00:33.934 --> 00:35.669
the Colonel will
 see me as a threat.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.071
Will it be you?

00:37.105 --> 00:38.606
I came to ask
 for your forgiveness.

00:38.639 --> 00:40.108
I forgive you, Ronald.

00:41.942 --> 00:43.411
That looks like our shuttle.

00:43.444 --> 00:45.913
RUSH: The shuttle
 was restored to
 its original condition,

00:45.946 --> 00:47.915
better than it was before.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.417
JOHANSEN: If they can send
 our people back to us,

00:49.450 --> 00:51.252
don't you think
 it's possible they can
 save our daughter?

00:51.285 --> 00:53.421
I need to know.

00:53.454 --> 00:57.091
VARRO: I know that
 there were no cabins,
 certainly no children.

00:57.125 --> 01:01.295
YOUNG: Simeon killed
 the man guarding him,
 then he killed Ginn.

01:01.329 --> 01:03.897
Don't you act like
 you are the only person
 aboard this ship

01:03.931 --> 01:04.998
that has lost someone
 that they care about.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.072
(COMPUTER BUZZING)

01:13.974 --> 01:15.276

He hasn't shown yet.

01:17.778 --> 01:18.879
(STATIC BUZZES)

01:18.912 --> 01:20.114
Eli, where are you?

01:21.782 --> 01:22.916
Eli, you're needed
 on the bridge.

01:25.986 --> 01:27.121

01:34.162 --> 01:36.397
(BUZZING STOPS)

01:36.430 --> 01:37.965
Thanks. I'm not sure
 what happened there.

01:37.998 --> 01:39.133
I think I must've...

01:39.167 --> 01:41.135
Yeah, yeah,
very interesting.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.237
(POWERING DOWN)

01:43.271 --> 01:45.139
VOLKER: Whoops.
 RUSH: Mr. Volker?

01:45.173 --> 01:47.275
Sorry, I was
 running a diagnostic

01:47.308 --> 01:49.277
on the ship's power
 distribution network,

01:49.310 --> 01:50.844
and I think...

01:50.878 --> 01:52.946
Did you remember to bypass
the critical systems?

01:52.980 --> 01:55.449
Uh... No.

01:58.018 --> 01:59.320
(POWERING UP)

01:59.353 --> 02:00.854
There we go.

02:06.294 --> 02:08.795
BRODY: This is interesting.

02:08.829 --> 02:11.199
Looks like Destiny
 picked up some sort of
 remote energy signature.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.801
Mr. Brody,
 please don't make me
 come over there.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.138
Why don't you be my guest?

02:26.914 --> 02:27.748
So?

02:32.386 --> 02:34.355
YOUNG: What do
 you mean, "distant"?

02:34.388 --> 02:36.023
We're on a spaceship
 in the middle of nowhere.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.226
From where I'm sitting,
everything is distant.

02:38.259 --> 02:41.229
This energy signature,
 it's come from an area

02:41.262 --> 02:44.031
outside of the course
 mapped out for us
 by the seed ships.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.799
Now, getting there
 would take a bit of
 a detour.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.301
How much of a detour?

02:47.335 --> 02:48.502
About a day's journey in FTL.

02:49.903 --> 02:52.473
We have any guesses
what it could be?

02:52.506 --> 02:56.176
It could be
potential new power source,
signs of intelligent life.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.078
Big black monolith
 orbiting a planet?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.181
Sorry. Overslept.

03:01.215 --> 03:02.416
There's no way of telling,

03:02.450 --> 03:04.418
which is precisely
 why we should investigate.

03:04.452 --> 03:07.521
Whoa, whoa!
 Whatever happened to,
 "Destiny has a mission,"

03:07.555 --> 03:09.323
and, "We're all on board
and moving forward"?

03:09.357 --> 03:11.024
This isn't forward.
 This is sideways.

03:11.058 --> 03:12.493
We haven't abandoned
 the mission, Mr. Brody,

03:12.526 --> 03:14.194
merely delaying it.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.897
But Lisa's right.
 This energy signature

03:16.930 --> 03:18.566
could be indicative
 of intelligent life.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.268
Best case scenario,
in my opinion.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.769
For real?

03:24.438 --> 03:26.240
Do I have to
 remind everyone

03:26.274 --> 03:29.343
what happened
 the last time we encountered
 an alien life form?

03:29.377 --> 03:32.280
Or the time before that?
 Or the time before that?

03:32.313 --> 03:35.048
Yeah, but you can't
 judge a neighborhood
 by a bunch of bad neighbors.

03:35.082 --> 03:37.918
Are you kidding?
 That's exactly how you
 judge a neighborhood.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.520
Look, it's possible
that whatever's out there

03:39.553 --> 03:40.954
could be of great
 benefit to both,

03:40.988 --> 03:42.790
ourselves and
 Destiny' mission.

03:46.427 --> 03:48.228
Okay, check it out.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.229
Let's plot a new course.

03:54.468 --> 03:55.936
(SIGHS)

03:57.505 --> 04:00.107
How do you do that?

04:00.140 --> 04:01.809
Okay, let's get
Chloe up here.

04:01.842 --> 04:04.345
She can make
the necessary calculations.

04:27.501 --> 04:30.571
Sorry. Sorry,
 had my music on.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.473
We're about to
 drop out of FTL.

04:32.506 --> 04:34.475
Ah, okay. Thanks.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.265
ELI: Is that...

04:58.298 --> 04:59.900
Ships, or what's
 left of them.

05:02.169 --> 05:05.339
That is one hell
 of a battlefield.

05:05.373 --> 05:08.976
WRAY: Was a battlefield.
 Now it's a graveyard.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.561
So...

05:27.595 --> 05:31.365
Uh, turns out
 the energy signature
 Destin locked onto

05:31.399 --> 05:34.535
was the clustered
 radiation pockets
 of the various ships.

05:34.568 --> 05:38.472
It looks like at
 least one of them
 is familiar to us.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.674
That's the same
type of ship
you and Dr. Rush

05:40.708 --> 05:42.676
explored
 a couple weeks back.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.144
Yeah, from the looks
 of things,

05:44.177 --> 05:45.646
they came out
 the losers in this fight.

05:45.679 --> 05:48.215
I'm having Destiny's
 computer run a program

05:48.248 --> 05:50.017
that'll plot back some of
 these dispersion patterns.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.919
Hopefully then
 we'll get a better idea
 of what's going on here.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.353
In the meantime?

05:53.387 --> 05:54.555
In the meantime, Colonel,
 we've come a long way.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.690
It seems a shame
 to leave empty-handed.

05:56.724 --> 06:00.160
I suggest a bit of
 cautious exploration.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.430
Mr. Brody, maybe you'd do
 the honors this time.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.737
You know, it's like
 a space junkyard.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.239

 hundreds of them,

06:12.272 --> 06:14.742

It's... (SIGHS)
 It's damn creepy.

06:20.380 --> 06:23.250
Anyway, I just
 thought I'd let you know
 what's going on.

06:25.986 --> 06:27.455
(STAMMERS)
 What's the matter?

06:27.488 --> 06:28.722
I already told you,

06:30.624 --> 06:32.626
visiting me
is a waste of time.

06:32.660 --> 06:34.762
I don't want you
 putting your life on hold

06:34.795 --> 06:37.097
just so you can come here
 and watch me disappear.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.400
(CHUCKLES) Disappear?
 Chloe...

06:40.434 --> 06:42.002
It's spreading faster now.

06:46.474 --> 06:47.975
I've tried to fight it,

06:49.309 --> 06:52.480
control it,
 but it's stronger than me.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.150
Sooner or later,
 I'm going to stop being me

06:57.184 --> 07:00.287
and become something else,
 something dangerous,

07:00.320 --> 07:02.322
that won't be allowed
 to stay on the ship.

07:02.355 --> 07:05.125
I won't let that happen.

07:05.158 --> 07:07.427
There's nothing
 you can do to stop it.

07:09.530 --> 07:12.466
The best we can do
is make use of me
while I'm still me.

07:12.500 --> 07:14.267
Will you stop
 talking like this?

07:14.301 --> 07:17.104
Why, Matt?
 Why deny the inevitable?

07:17.137 --> 07:19.807
Because it is
 not inevitable.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.176
Of course it is,
 and deep down,
 you know it.

07:26.179 --> 07:29.483
You've already
 started pulling away.

 we spent the night together?

he could spare you.

He did?
Mmm-hmm.

(SIGHS) I'll save
 you the trouble.
 I'm not crazy,

08:43.591 --> 08:46.493
which is pretty
 darn impressive,
 all things considered.

08:46.526 --> 08:48.228
I went from living
at home with my mom

08:48.261 --> 08:49.763
to being
stranded on a spaceship

08:49.797 --> 08:52.099
billions of light years
from Earth.

08:52.132 --> 08:54.434
And screw
 the last starfighter,

08:54.467 --> 08:57.905
because all those
hours playing Halo
didn't prepare me for this.

08:57.938 --> 09:01.241
No one was prepared
for this.

09:01.274 --> 09:05.212
Everyone else had
 some sort of training,

09:05.245 --> 09:10.217
but, hey, I've come
 a long way in my 10 months.

09:13.286 --> 09:19.426
I've fought space battles,
 survived deadly radiation,

09:19.459 --> 09:24.231
time-traveled, sort of.
 I'm still trying to
 figure that one out.

09:24.264 --> 09:28.235
I don't think you're crazy.
At least, no crazier
than the rest of us.

09:29.469 --> 09:30.470
Really?

09:31.438 --> 09:33.240
Okay, then. Good chat.

09:33.273 --> 09:36.610

 two friends talking.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.914
You have been
 a little distracted lately,

and that has
 some of us worried.

09:44.284 --> 09:47.955
You guys are worried because
 I'm a little distracted?

09:47.988 --> 09:50.924
We're worried because,
 given the recent events,

09:50.958 --> 09:54.828
you should be a hell
 of a lot more than just
 a little distracted.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.637
The memorial video
 you put together
 for Sergeant Riley,

10:04.672 --> 10:06.206
it was very moving.

10:09.643 --> 10:10.811
You know what's weird?

10:12.813 --> 10:18.318
Sometimes, I'll forget
 that he's gone.

10:18.351 --> 10:21.689
I'll actually walk
 into the Gate Room
 and turn my head,

10:21.722 --> 10:24.658
and then,
for a split second,

10:24.692 --> 10:26.493
I'll wonder
 where the hell he is,

10:27.627 --> 10:30.430
and then I remember.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.834
He was a very important part
 of your life here.

10:33.867 --> 10:38.538
When your whole world
 collapses down to less
 than 100 people

10:38.571 --> 10:40.207
in a confined space,

10:40.240 --> 10:43.944
it all becomes
 important to you, Camile.

10:43.977 --> 10:48.515
Riley was
 part of this ship,
 and losing him,

10:48.548 --> 10:51.251
it wasn't just...
It wasn't just sad.
It was wrong.

10:53.020 --> 10:54.221
What about losing Ginn?

11:06.666 --> 11:09.870
So, when did you finish
fixing the third suit?

11:09.903 --> 11:11.905
Yesterday.
 It's perfectly safe.

wait, well, then,

 if something goes wrong.

Great. Sitting around
 in this room all day

Well, you can hardly
 blame the Colonel for
 confining you to quarters

17:42.895 --> 17:44.931

 happened with Simeon.

17:44.964 --> 17:47.767
I understand,
 but you have to realize
 that Simeon was unstable.

 but you didn't tell us.

 I was misled.

Yeah, well,
 I had plenty of help
 with that one.

27:58.444 --> 28:01.881
The aliens we encountered
 while exploring it,

28:01.914 --> 28:03.750
turns out they
 weren't hostile after all,

28:05.384 --> 28:06.786
just desperate.

28:09.722 --> 28:12.058
Afte Destiny disconnected
 and made the jump to FTL,

28:12.091 --> 28:14.260
I figured I was a goner.

28:14.293 --> 28:15.995
I was surrounded.
 They had me at their mercy.

28:16.028 --> 28:19.732
But they ended up
 being friendly.

28:19.766 --> 28:23.535
I wouldn't go so far
as to call them friendly,
but, uh,

28:23.569 --> 28:26.272
they weren't
 exactly interested
 in harming me either.

28:26.305 --> 28:28.775
They were curious.

28:30.943 --> 28:32.411
I tried communicating
 with them,

28:32.444 --> 28:33.913
but that was
 next to impossible.

28:33.946 --> 28:37.784
I mean, verbally, anyway,
 so we found a shortcut.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.719

 pods are outfitted
 with neural stimulators

28:40.753 --> 28:42.755

 occupants' brains active

28:42.789 --> 28:44.723
during extended
 hibernations,

28:44.757 --> 28:46.058
so when they hooked me up...

28:46.092 --> 28:49.628
It's hard to describe
 the experience.

28:49.661 --> 28:51.831
It was like watching
 an entire film library
 in less than a day.

28:53.565 --> 28:56.602
I saw images,
 thousands of them.

28:56.635 --> 29:00.472
Most were a blur,
 totally incomprehensible,
 but others were clearer.

29:00.506 --> 29:03.042
And over time,
 the pieces drifted together,

29:03.075 --> 29:04.944
and I was able to form
 a basic understanding

29:04.977 --> 29:06.879
of the aliens
 and their history.

29:06.913 --> 29:09.081
They call themselves
 the Ursini,

29:09.115 --> 29:11.818
and after a while,
 they began to trust me.

29:11.851 --> 29:16.622

 we were able to bring
 the seed ship online.

29:20.827 --> 29:23.062
What did you do
for food and water?

29:23.095 --> 29:26.398
The pods provide
 basic nutrients
 to their occupants.

29:26.432 --> 29:28.968
I never thought
 I'd say this, but I missed
 the food here on Destiny.

29:29.001 --> 29:32.604
So, wait a minute,
these aliens helped you

29:32.638 --> 29:34.640
out of the goodness
of their hearts?

29:34.673 --> 29:36.008
There's a little more
 to it than that.

29:38.510 --> 29:39.511
They need our help.

29:42.514 --> 29:46.085
ELI: The ships
 that came after us are
 automated attack drones.

29:46.118 --> 29:51.590
Apparently, years ago,
 Telford's aliens, the Ursini,

29:51.623 --> 29:53.459
made the same mistake
 that we did and woke
 them up,

29:53.492 --> 29:55.928
and they've been
 fighting them ever since.

29:55.962 --> 29:59.431
When they
 discovered the seed ship,
 they boarded it for...

29:59.465 --> 30:00.867
For long-term
 reconnaissance,

30:00.900 --> 30:02.969
hoping it would
give them an edge

30:03.002 --> 30:05.437
in their war
 against the drones.

30:05.471 --> 30:08.174
Their stay onboard
 was supposed
 to be temporary,

30:08.207 --> 30:11.510
but no one ever
went back for them.

30:11.543 --> 30:13.913
They were in stasis
 for who knows how long
 before we came around.

30:18.217 --> 30:21.687
They drained
 the power away from Destiny
 because they were desperate,

30:21.720 --> 30:24.190
just looking for a way home,

30:24.223 --> 30:26.558
and now,
 even though they finally
 have a way back,

30:26.592 --> 30:29.828
they're afraid
to make contact

30:29.862 --> 30:31.864
until they're sure that
 the drone threat is over,

30:32.664 --> 30:34.833
which is where we come in.

30:34.867 --> 30:36.602
We can't trust them.

We really don't
 have much of a choice.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.047
So what are we
 going to do, then?

30:49.848 --> 30:52.484
That's... That's still
being discussed.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.486
You know,
 it's only a matter of time

30:54.520 --> 30:56.722
before the drones
 circumvent that star
 and find us,

30:56.755 --> 31:00.059
and with the FTL
 engines still offline,
 we're sitting ducks.

31:00.092 --> 31:02.494
Maybe not. Maybe there's
 a way out of this.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.696
We help the Ursini
 defeat the drones.

31:04.730 --> 31:07.666
We barely survived
 our first encounter
 with those things.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.936
That's just because
 we were going about it
 the wrong way.

31:09.969 --> 31:11.870
According to Telford,

31:11.904 --> 31:13.705
the drones are controlled
 by a command ship.

31:13.739 --> 31:16.675
Now, we take out
 that command ship,
 we cripple the drones.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.843
Simple as that.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.445
I doubt it'll be simple.

31:19.478 --> 31:21.580
I'm hoping for
 a step up from impossible.

31:21.613 --> 31:25.617
Do we know where
 this command ship
 is located?

31:25.651 --> 31:28.020
They do. It's out
 of sublight range.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.121
We would have
 to make the jump.

31:29.155 --> 31:30.923
And have you explained
 that our jumping capabilities

31:30.957 --> 31:32.191
have been compromised?

31:32.224 --> 31:34.260
Telford has made them
aware of the situation.

31:34.293 --> 31:36.262
They've offered
 to give us a lift.

31:36.295 --> 31:38.130
I don't understand.

31:38.164 --> 31:40.532
They engage their FTL drives
 while we're docked,

31:40.566 --> 31:41.767
and we jump with them.

31:41.800 --> 31:42.935
That's possible?

31:42.969 --> 31:44.636
Theoretically, yes.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.772
Hmm. "Theoretically."

31:46.805 --> 31:48.874
There's always
a risk when you attempt

31:48.907 --> 31:50.709
a jump so soon
 after a drop-out,

31:50.742 --> 31:51.810
but assuming it works...

31:51.843 --> 31:52.945
Hmm.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.581
...first they take
 us someplace safe,

31:55.614 --> 31:58.117
then we play for time,
 delay them long enough

31:58.150 --> 32:01.787
till we can get
our own FTL engines
back online.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.922
Double-cross them,
 you mean.
 Yeah.

32:03.956 --> 32:07.960
No, we can't do that.
 If they have
 offered to help us...

32:07.994 --> 32:11.297
It's a fantastic opportunity
 to take advantage of
 their generosity, yes.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.965
(WRAY SIGHS)
 That's not a good idea.

32:12.999 --> 32:14.933
Why not?
 I mean, at that point,

32:14.967 --> 32:16.635
they're in no position
 to harm us.

32:16.668 --> 32:18.904
No, but in case
 you've forgotten,

32:18.937 --> 32:20.839
they still hold the key
to us dialing Earth.

32:27.879 --> 32:30.316
Where are Park and Brody?

32:30.349 --> 32:33.685
ELI: Effecting repairs
 on some of
 the damaged systems.

32:40.326 --> 32:41.994
And what are you doing?

32:43.629 --> 32:45.597
Monitoring the ship's
 power levels.

32:45.631 --> 32:46.698
Yeah?

32:48.634 --> 32:50.969
It might interest you to know
 that you're bleeding energy

32:51.003 --> 32:52.138
from one of
 the weapons platforms.

32:54.306 --> 32:55.674
Shoot.

32:57.243 --> 32:58.944
(CONSOLE BEEPING)

32:58.977 --> 33:00.179

33:00.212 --> 33:01.580

33:09.088 --> 33:11.657

33:11.690 --> 33:12.724
I'm in the middle
 of the...

33:12.758 --> 33:13.725
Go.

33:16.028 --> 33:18.230
Maybe I'll go
 help Park and Brody.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.767
I know. I screwed up.

33:23.335 --> 33:28.140
No. It's a minor oversight,
 one of many, as of late,

33:28.174 --> 33:33.011
but you haven't screwed up.
 Not yet, anyway.

33:33.045 --> 33:35.381
I'm sure with your
 present attitude,
 it's only a matter of time.

33:35.414 --> 33:38.217
Yeah, you know, I get it.

33:38.250 --> 33:41.820
People are
 depending on the boy genius.
 I can't let them down.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.189
And yet,
 despite all that genius,

33:43.222 --> 33:44.923
you couldn't save the life
 of the woman you loved.

33:52.098 --> 33:53.899
What?

33:53.932 --> 33:55.834
Someone bigger
 and stronger came along,
 took her away from you,

33:55.867 --> 33:57.069
and there wasn't a thing
 you could do about it.

33:59.205 --> 34:01.207
I'm sure you were
 so blinded by rage

34:01.240 --> 34:03.675
you even imagined
 getting revenge

34:03.709 --> 34:08.679
on the guy that killed her,
 beating the bully
 at his own game.

34:08.714 --> 34:12.751
Even if you had,
 it wouldn't have
 changed a damn thing.

34:12.784 --> 34:15.954
You'd still be
 getting up in the morning,
 she'd still be dead.

34:18.956 --> 34:21.760
I'm out of here.

34:21.793 --> 34:25.063
You know, we grew up
 taught to believe that
 everyone's equal,

34:25.097 --> 34:27.933
that you're no better
 than anyone else.

34:27.966 --> 34:31.103
(SCOFFING) Of course,
 that's a lie.

34:31.137 --> 34:33.071
Some are better than others,

34:33.105 --> 34:36.308
and it's those who recognize
 what makes them better,

34:36.342 --> 34:38.844
and learn to exploit that,
 who succeed.

34:42.947 --> 34:45.951
You've got so
 much potential, Eli.

34:45.984 --> 34:49.455
You're capable of success
 beyond your wildest dreams,

34:49.487 --> 34:52.757
but the only way that
 you can achieve that,

34:52.791 --> 34:56.795
you've got to make sure
 you don't get beaten down.

34:56.828 --> 34:59.698
You can't give up,
 not now you're so close.

35:02.033 --> 35:05.671
YOUNG: Am I
interrupting something?

35:05.704 --> 35:07.806
Telford communicated
 with the Ursini

35:07.839 --> 35:09.841
and is on his way
 back from the seed ship.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.843
Looks like we got
ourselves a deal.

35:22.188 --> 35:23.989
All right, let's let
 them know we're ready.

35:27.025 --> 35:30.162
So this should work,
 in principle.

35:30.196 --> 35:31.330
It's really no different
 than when

35:31.363 --> 35:33.265
the shuttle jumps
 in FTL with Destiny.

35:33.299 --> 35:35.867
Except that the shuttle
is massively smaller
than Destiny,

35:35.901 --> 35:38.837
and designed to do that,
 while we're three times
 the size of the seed ship

35:38.870 --> 35:39.938
and just hoping
 for the best.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.840
There's also
the fact that we're
attempting to jump

35:41.873 --> 35:44.343
in the three-hour
 danger window.

35:44.376 --> 35:47.479
But what's
 the worst that can happen?
 It doesn't work.

35:47.513 --> 35:49.348
VOLKER: (CHUCKLES)
 Hell, no.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.950
It actually does work,
 and at some point we detach,

35:51.983 --> 35:55.020
and the ship's
 million-year-old
 structural integrity gives,

35:55.053 --> 35:57.923
and we end up vaporized.
 That's the worst
 that can happen.

35:59.024 --> 36:00.158
Are you guys done?

36:03.895 --> 36:05.197
Less than a minute
 before we jump.

36:13.071 --> 36:18.410
In approximately four hours,
 we will drop out
 to a safer area.

36:18.444 --> 36:23.215
Once there,
 we'll have time to effect
 any necessary repairs

36:23.249 --> 36:25.917
before launching the attack
 on the command ship.

I'm guessing that's
their command ship.
