02:26.916 --> 02:27.916
Who are you?

02:27.996 --> 02:30.396
What are you doing
in this girl's apartment?

02:45.195 --> 02:46.195
Hello.

02:46.275 --> 02:49.075
Diana, switch this call
to the monitor, please.

02:54.995 --> 02:55.995
What's up, Joe?

02:56.075 --> 02:59.475
- I'm sorry to disturb you this late.
- I've already been disturbed.

02:59.635 --> 03:00.755
What's wrong?

03:00.875 --> 03:03.795
Two men just tried to break in here,
but didn't make it.

03:03.875 --> 03:06.795
- Then it's worse than I thought.
- What are you talking about?

03:06.875 --> 03:10.154
Somebody's apparently gotten Steve.
And now they made a try for you.

03:10.314 --> 03:12.794
- What? Kidnapped?
- We don't know.

03:12.874 --> 03:14.794
You know that he left for his vacation.

03:14.874 --> 03:17.794
I know, Diana. Steve left for a vacation
in L.A. this morning.

03:17.874 --> 03:18.914
Then how?

03:18.994 --> 03:23.074
He was supposed to have dinner with our
Regional Bureau Chief in L.A. this evening.

03:23.154 --> 03:24.194
He didn't show.

03:24.274 --> 03:26.834
Kelly called the hotel.
He hadn't gotten there at all.

03:26.874 --> 03:28.114
Oh, no.

03:28.194 --> 03:29.194
Exactly.

03:29.914 --> 03:31.714
First Steve, now you.

03:31.914 --> 03:34.514
- What about yourself?
- I'm all right, so far.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.433
But I haven't got any answers either.

03:36.513 --> 03:38.233
Who? What? Why?

03:38.313 --> 03:40.833
Is it a knockout on the top level
of the I.A.D.C...

03:40.913 --> 03:42.153
or does it go even further?

03:42.233 --> 03:44.353
Diana, can you have a bag packed
in 20 minutes?

03:44.473 --> 03:45.753
Fifteen. Now listen, Joe.

03:45.833 --> 03:47.433
What could it be? Why?

03:47.513 --> 03:50.273
- We know there's no case that's hot now.
- I don't knoW.

03:50.393 --> 03:51.953
But I do know you're apparently...

03:52.033 --> 03:54.513
a prime target
for whoever's doing this job.

03:54.593 --> 03:58.233
I thought the I.A.D.C. safe house
in Arlington until we get a line.

03:58.633 --> 04:00.673
Joe, I'm going to pack a bag...

04:00.753 --> 04:03.312
and make a reservation
on the redeye flight into LAX.

04:04.672 --> 04:06.632
I can't stop you from going after Steve...

04:06.712 --> 04:08.752
but there's a man
in the White House who can.

04:08.912 --> 04:12.872
There's a man in the White House
that you're not gonna call. Isn't that right?

04:14.472 --> 04:16.312
Call me when you got a flight number.

04:16.392 --> 04:17.591
I'll call Kelly in L.A.

04:17.712 --> 04:21.471
No. Don't call anyone yet.
Somebody knew what flight Steve was on.

04:21.672 --> 04:24.872
I Won't fly into LAX.
I'll take a detour to South Coast.

04:26.552 --> 04:29.592
You have my blessing.
I hope you don't need it.

04:50.551 --> 04:52.191
- Hi.
- Hi.

04:52.471 --> 04:53.591
Easy.

04:54.791 --> 04:57.511
- Wasn't the other driver ahead of you?
- Sure.

04:57.591 --> 05:00.030
But you're the prettiest girl
on the morning flight.

05:00.110 --> 05:02.430
Won't be any prettier on the noon
or night flights.

05:02.550 --> 05:04.150
And I'm Pete, the driver. Where to?

05:04.230 --> 05:05.430
Thank you.

05:05.630 --> 05:07.270
- Camden Hotel.
- Right.

05:10.790 --> 05:11.830
Thank you.

05:13.350 --> 05:14.910
Have a nice day, buddy.

05:38.469 --> 05:39.989
L.A. your home?

05:40.069 --> 05:41.869
No, but I visit here fairly often.

05:41.949 --> 05:43.669
- How about you?
- Native son.

05:43.749 --> 05:45.709
I saw some of the world
when I was racing.

05:45.789 --> 05:47.669
But you can't beat the old Golden State.

05:47.749 --> 05:50.829
- You were a race driver?
- It's what I said. "Pete, the driver. "

05:50.909 --> 05:52.349
I took a third at Cannes, once.

05:52.469 --> 05:55.668
Then I tried going through the far wall
at the Indy 500.

05:56.148 --> 05:57.468
Wrong way to go.

05:57.828 --> 05:59.148
That's too bad.

05:59.508 --> 06:00.988
Breaks of a tough game.

06:01.108 --> 06:05.868
I can't race anymore, but the leg doesn't
bother me unless I try and dance all night.

06:11.468 --> 06:14.468
Pete. I'm gonna take a chance
and tell you something.

06:14.548 --> 06:16.268
There's a car following us.

06:16.348 --> 06:18.868
Yeah, I noticed.
Husband? Boyfriend? Cops?

06:18.948 --> 06:20.827
No, listen, Pete. It's serious.

06:21.907 --> 06:23.347
I work with the government.

06:23.427 --> 06:24.627
All right.

06:25.147 --> 06:26.707
- Look.
- I see.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.667
It's possible
they're gonna try to kidnap me or kill me.

06:29.747 --> 06:31.867
Do you wanna
let me off at the next corner?

06:31.947 --> 06:32.947
No.

06:33.027 --> 06:36.987
But if we're getting into something hairy,
you could at least tell me your name.

06:37.067 --> 06:38.827
Diana. Diana Prince.

06:39.387 --> 06:41.427
Peter Johnson. Pete.

07:34.425 --> 07:37.185
Take off. Grab a phone
and have the operator get the LAPD.

07:37.265 --> 07:38.545
Move.

07:45.944 --> 07:49.064
I guess you know you're gonna lose
your driver's licenses.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.423
Now you have to tell me the truth.

08:16.503 --> 08:19.583
- Why were you stopping Diana Prince?
- Man paid us $150.

08:19.663 --> 08:21.063
What were you supposed to do?

08:21.143 --> 08:24.503
Leave her tied up and gagged in a
motel room at 2130 East Soto Street.

08:24.583 --> 08:26.543
That's in East L.A., Miss.

08:27.583 --> 08:28.823
Who hired you?

08:28.983 --> 08:32.823
All we know is the first name, Angel.
Chicano kid we were in CYA with.

08:32.982 --> 08:36.663
California Youth Authority.
Some pretty hard cases come out of there.

08:36.943 --> 08:38.702
What did he want with her?

08:38.942 --> 08:41.062
Did he mention
a man named Steve Trevor?

08:41.142 --> 08:42.182
No.

08:42.982 --> 08:45.622
When I release you,
you'll forget what I've asked you...

08:45.702 --> 08:47.782
and everything that you've told me.

08:52.382 --> 08:56.822
That's terrific. I can't think of an encore,
but I'd like to be around when you do it.

08:56.902 --> 08:58.862
Shouldn't those guys hit the slammer?

08:58.982 --> 09:01.622
They're not important.
Thank you for your help.

09:01.742 --> 09:02.782
Yeah, sure.

09:02.902 --> 09:05.301
But I've gotta go back
and try to find my fare.

09:05.381 --> 09:06.501
She's a standup lady.

09:06.621 --> 09:10.581
If you don't find her, why not drop off
her luggage at her hotel? And your card.

09:10.661 --> 09:13.461
- I'm sure she'd like to see you get paid.
- Yeah, okay.

09:13.581 --> 09:15.701
I feel like I let her down this time around...

09:15.781 --> 09:19.021
but if she needs any help,
the card will tell her how to get to me.

09:19.101 --> 09:20.141
Okay.

09:20.661 --> 09:23.541
- What's your name?
- Wonder Woman.

09:26.341 --> 09:27.981
Now it seems to fit together.

09:37.580 --> 09:38.700
Hello.

09:40.060 --> 09:41.380
Not again.

09:42.300 --> 09:43.780
I can't figure it out.

09:44.180 --> 09:47.540
It's a replay of the mess
in the girl's apartment in Washington.

09:49.420 --> 09:52.900
All right, Angel. I guess we'll
have to bring in a professional...

09:53.420 --> 09:55.260
and just have him dump her.

09:56.780 --> 09:59.660
Carolyn will hire him,
and you'll handle the payoff.

09:59.820 --> 10:01.299
I'll get back to you.

10:02.979 --> 10:05.019
It's a mistake keeping him alive.

10:05.139 --> 10:07.979
It's a mistake you'll have to live with.

10:08.059 --> 10:10.779
I don't understand.
Why is he so important to you?

10:10.859 --> 10:14.139
A few years ago, he saved my life,
risking his own doing it.

10:14.539 --> 10:16.659
You can call it old loyalty.

10:16.899 --> 10:18.779
Loyalty is for losers.

10:20.019 --> 10:21.579
Get out, now.

10:23.339 --> 10:25.699
I was just leaving. I'll be back, though.

10:25.779 --> 10:28.058
I was almost sure you would be.

10:37.858 --> 10:39.338
Sleep tight, Steve.

10:41.618 --> 10:43.778
There's nothing good to wake up for.

12:33.774 --> 12:36.614
All right, miss. What's the hurry?
Somebody after you?

12:36.734 --> 12:39.334
- Yes, he was, but-
- Hey, Jack.

12:39.534 --> 12:41.694
No, wait a minute. I can explain.

12:41.774 --> 12:44.934
My name is Diana Prince. I'm with
the Inter-Agency-Defense Command.

12:45.014 --> 12:48.893
Well, I've heard of it, but...
Okay, what can we do for you, miss?

12:48.973 --> 12:52.213
I'd appreciate it if you'd just stay here
while I make a phone call.

12:52.333 --> 12:54.333
Sure thing. But is anything wrong?

12:54.413 --> 12:56.053
Not with you here.

12:56.253 --> 12:57.693
I'll be right back.

13:22.892 --> 13:23.932
Yes.

13:25.532 --> 13:28.092
Has the call been
switched to a secured line?

13:28.172 --> 13:29.732
Put her on please.

13:30.572 --> 13:32.132
Diana, where are you?

13:32.212 --> 13:33.452
Downtown L.A.

13:33.532 --> 13:35.932
I decided
to take a cab directly to your office...

13:36.012 --> 13:38.972
but a man in the elevator
tried to intercept me.

13:39.332 --> 13:41.971
They seem to know
what we're gonna do before we do it.

13:42.131 --> 13:45.371
- How did you get away?
- Couple of very nice, young LAPD officers.

13:45.451 --> 13:48.251
- They make an arrest?
- No. I didn't want them to try.

13:48.331 --> 13:50.011
The man was a professional.

13:50.251 --> 13:53.171
- You recognized him?
- Not the man, but the eyes.

13:53.251 --> 13:55.651
Something in his eyes.
They might have gotten him...

13:55.731 --> 13:59.171
but there were people in the lobby
and someone could've gotten hurt.

13:59.251 --> 14:02.331
All right. Give me your address.
I'll have someone bring you in.

14:02.411 --> 14:05.371
- Better still, I'll come myself.
- Not just yet, John.

14:05.651 --> 14:09.530
What you said before is true.
They seem to be ahead of us all the way...

14:09.610 --> 14:11.450
and I wanna find out why.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.650
You're saying
you wanna stay out in the cold.

14:15.050 --> 14:18.330
For a while longer, John.
Call you back in about three hours.

14:18.410 --> 14:22.170
- Anything on Steve?
- Not a Word. Not a trace.

14:23.410 --> 14:25.970
I got a call from Joe Atkinson
only a few minutes ago.

14:26.090 --> 14:28.730
Somebody put a plastic bomb
under the hood of his car.

14:28.810 --> 14:32.250
But he found it with the help
of the Washington, D.C., Bomb Squad.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.370
I see.

14:34.610 --> 14:36.049
Call you back in three hours.

15:01.969 --> 15:03.328
Cover your face.

15:06.168 --> 15:08.688
Wait a minute. Phone's ringing.
Just a minute.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.328
Hello.

15:15.408 --> 15:17.608
This is Diana Prince. Remember me?

15:18.288 --> 15:19.608
How could I forget?

15:19.688 --> 15:23.248
I wanna thank you for dropping off
my luggage and leaving your card.

15:24.088 --> 15:26.768
You told Wonder Woman
that you'd give me a hand?

15:26.848 --> 15:27.888
Absolutely.

15:28.208 --> 15:31.167
Well, what I'm gonna ask you to do
could be very dangerous.

15:32.287 --> 15:35.407
Look, before I was a driver, I was a Marine.
Where are you at?

15:36.207 --> 15:37.927
Eighth and Spring.

15:38.007 --> 15:40.887
Incidentally, I still haven't paid you
for the first trip.

15:40.967 --> 15:44.127
Don't worry about it.
I don't send out statements till the 15th.

15:44.247 --> 15:47.767
I'll get Mrs. Garcia to take care of my son,
and I'm there.

15:47.927 --> 15:49.647
- Ten minutes.
- Thanks, Pete.

15:58.846 --> 16:00.006
Thank you, gentlemen.

16:00.086 --> 16:01.886
You still look worried.

16:01.966 --> 16:05.406
You're sure there's nothing
that Los Angeles' finest can do for you?

16:05.526 --> 16:07.726
You've really been enough help already.

16:07.806 --> 16:10.766
But if you give me your card,
I'm sure I can find something.

16:10.846 --> 16:13.926
Somehow I have the feeling
that you probably could.

16:34.125 --> 16:35.285
Terrific neighborhood.

16:35.365 --> 16:38.125
The address Wonder Woman said
they would've taken me to...

16:38.205 --> 16:40.845
- looks like it's right here.
- That's a fascinating lady.

16:40.925 --> 16:43.565
She usually show up
when you're in some kind of trouble?

16:43.645 --> 16:46.605
Sometimes. But usually
when the man I work with is in trouble.

16:46.685 --> 16:48.525
The one you think bought the farm?

16:48.605 --> 16:49.925
Bought the farm?

16:50.765 --> 16:54.204
Expression we had in Nam.
You didn't die, you bought the farm.

16:54.684 --> 16:55.724
Well, shall we?

16:55.804 --> 16:59.644
Listen, I think it'd be a better idea
if you stayed here and kept an eye out...

16:59.724 --> 17:02.324
- while I go in and take a look myself.
- You sure?

17:02.404 --> 17:04.124
I'm sure. It's better.

17:04.644 --> 17:06.284
- Okay?
- Okay.

18:55.720 --> 18:58.240
- What is your name?
- Angel Velasquez.

18:58.320 --> 18:59.760
And who are you working for?

18:59.840 --> 19:01.480
I can't explain it.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.160
It's called the Movement.

19:03.240 --> 19:06.480
But I only know the two guys
I sent after you, and the girl Carolyn.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.400
Carolyn. Where can I find her?

19:08.480 --> 19:10.839
I don't know. She finds me.

19:11.399 --> 19:13.519
Don't you have
a last name, a phone number?

19:13.599 --> 19:16.439
No. And that's why
the Movement is so effective.

19:16.519 --> 19:18.479
No one knows more than a few members.

19:18.559 --> 19:20.359
What does the Movement plan to do?

19:20.439 --> 19:21.999
To change the world.

19:22.079 --> 19:24.719
So that those at the top
can be taken away from power...

19:24.799 --> 19:26.759
and those at the bottom shall be set free.

19:26.879 --> 19:28.239
Did this Carolyn recruit you?

19:28.319 --> 19:29.319
Yes.

19:29.399 --> 19:32.599
Funny thing. She used to be a cop.

19:33.119 --> 19:34.799
Did she tell you that?

19:35.439 --> 19:39.478
No. Cops can tell ex-cons.
And ex-cons can tell ex-cops.

19:40.518 --> 19:41.758
I can't explain it.

19:41.838 --> 19:45.918
But sometime, somewhere,
she wore the badge.

20:01.278 --> 20:02.398
Hi.

20:03.238 --> 20:06.597
- Are you open for business?
- No. I'm sorry, buddy, I got a fare.

20:06.717 --> 20:08.677
Well, that's quite all right.

20:52.636 --> 20:54.316
- Taxi, lady?
- Oh, yes.

21:11.315 --> 21:13.715
For the next few hours,
I need a place to stay...

21:13.795 --> 21:15.915
until my people and I can
find out some things.

21:15.995 --> 21:19.715
Listen, Mrs. Garcia's got an extra room,
and Ted and I are right upstairs.

21:19.875 --> 21:22.915
- There's a phone there, too.
- Ted's your son?

21:22.995 --> 21:26.355
Yeah, he's eight. But he's big for his age.

21:26.835 --> 21:29.714
There's one thing. He can't talk.

21:29.994 --> 21:33.274
- You mean he's mute?
- The doctors aren't sure.

21:33.994 --> 21:37.514
It could be a psychological block.
They can't find anything...

21:37.594 --> 21:39.794
- Organic?
- Yeah. That's the word.

21:40.034 --> 21:42.034
I've got him in a good special school...

21:42.114 --> 21:44.634
and I spend
as much time with him as I can.

21:46.274 --> 21:47.954
Thanks for not asking.

21:48.594 --> 21:50.994
- Not asking about what?
- His mother.

21:51.954 --> 21:54.434
Actually there is not that much to it.

21:54.513 --> 21:58.473
She was a dancer in a nightclub
in Oceanside where Marines hang out.

21:59.633 --> 22:02.753
Nobody's fault,
we just never should have gotten married.

22:05.713 --> 22:07.433
How do you tell a kid that?

22:08.593 --> 22:12.273
Why don't I pick up some cheeseburgers
or tacos? You like tacos?

22:12.353 --> 22:14.713
I love tacos. Either one's fine.

22:26.392 --> 22:27.552
Tiger.

22:31.032 --> 22:33.192
You know what I got here? What is it?

22:34.792 --> 22:36.952
Lady'll think you haven't eaten in weeks!

22:37.392 --> 22:40.672
Ted. This is Miss Diana Prince.

22:41.512 --> 22:44.952
So nice to meet you, sir.
Would you like to take this bag in?

22:45.352 --> 22:46.752
You like tacos?

22:46.832 --> 22:48.912
Why don't we go eat? Okay?

23:32.990 --> 23:35.710
- So you've located the driver's house?
- Yes.

23:36.950 --> 23:39.870
But I gather she is the only one
you want taken out.

23:40.390 --> 23:42.350
Now I can't leave any witnesses.

23:43.510 --> 23:45.509
- And you want your money now?
- No.

23:46.629 --> 23:49.149
I had a bit of bad luck in that I missed her.

23:49.749 --> 23:52.269
But I'll trust you
until the job is completed.

23:53.629 --> 23:56.189
All right. Thank you.

24:02.549 --> 24:05.629
- Doesn't it ever bother you?
- Sometimes.

24:07.429 --> 24:10.389
As in this case,
when it's a young, attractive woman.

24:11.629 --> 24:14.468
- And you raise your prices then?
- No.

24:16.468 --> 24:19.028
It would bother me
doing what you're doing.

24:19.108 --> 24:21.188
- You don't know what we do.
- No.

24:21.908 --> 24:26.188
But I imagine it involves changing
the world through some form of violence.

24:26.268 --> 24:28.388
Senseless, wasteful violence.

24:28.508 --> 24:31.468
- The world has to be changed.
- Maybe.

24:32.308 --> 24:35.828
But I doubt very much
whether yours would be the group to do it.

24:35.948 --> 24:38.068
You'll make a name for yourselves.

24:38.228 --> 24:42.427
And you'll wind up in some alley,
prison, or a county grave.

24:44.227 --> 24:45.427
It's a shame.

24:46.467 --> 24:49.107
You're a very attractive
young woman yourself.

24:50.227 --> 24:52.427
It must be done by tomorrow night.

24:52.987 --> 24:54.347
It will be.

25:13.226 --> 25:15.266
Has Intersect come up with anything?

25:15.386 --> 25:17.466
We had the computers on it
most of the night.

25:17.546 --> 25:21.186
Before I came in, I got a call
that a very positive trace has just come in.

25:21.306 --> 25:23.346
- Go ahead then.
- Thank you, sir.

25:26.906 --> 25:29.186
Intersect trace: Carolyn Hamilton.

25:29.266 --> 25:32.106
Born: March 16, 1952 in San Francisco.

25:32.466 --> 25:36.265
Employed: San Francisco
Police Department, April 18, 1971.

25:36.625 --> 25:38.825
Resigned: May 11, 1975.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.905
No derogatory information, SFPD files.

25:42.305 --> 25:45.385
No present address.
Additional material forthcoming.

25:46.585 --> 25:49.145
Have the names of I.A.D.C.
personnel concerned...

25:49.225 --> 25:51.465
been intersected
with that of the Hamilton girl?

25:51.545 --> 25:56.265
Yes, sir. On April 4, 1972,
Steve Trevor and Carolyn Hamilton...

25:56.825 --> 25:59.665
Worked in an undercover capacity
to capture a group.

25:59.825 --> 26:01.425
Federal charges of espionage...

26:01.505 --> 26:05.104
plus federal and state charges
of import and sales of narcotics.

26:05.304 --> 26:09.264
In a gun battle, Agent Trevor sa ved
the life of police woman Hamilton.

26:09.344 --> 26:10.984
End Intersect trace.

26:11.184 --> 26:14.704
Is there anything happening
that might relate to this knockout?

26:14.784 --> 26:16.224
I've been thinking about that.

26:16.344 --> 26:19.384
The only thing I've come up with
is the World Trade Conference.

26:19.464 --> 26:22.264
But Steve and Diana coordinated
our L.A. office's plans...

26:22.344 --> 26:23.824
with the LAPD months ago.

26:23.904 --> 26:27.344
I took care of International Liaison
and you approved the final plan.

26:27.424 --> 26:29.303
But we are talking about a situation...

26:29.383 --> 26:33.863
Where a governor's aide, a deputy mayor
and heads of state will be in one spot.

26:33.943 --> 26:35.823
We'd better have you there, too.

26:35.903 --> 26:36.943
Thank you, sir.

26:37.023 --> 26:39.623
- Is Diana still out in the cold?
- Yes.

26:40.183 --> 26:43.863
But I've begun to believe,
somehow, she's made the right choice.

26:47.863 --> 26:50.423
I see. No way that it can be prevented?

26:53.063 --> 26:55.183
All right, I'll get him out of here.

26:55.703 --> 26:59.502
No. That problem is already
being taken care of.

27:08.982 --> 27:11.782
If you yell, Steve, no one's going to hear.

27:11.982 --> 27:13.622
I'm not gonna yell.

27:14.382 --> 27:16.422
May I have a drink of water?

27:17.382 --> 27:18.502
Certainly.

27:43.901 --> 27:44.901
Thanks.

27:46.341 --> 27:47.781
We're gonna have to move you.

27:47.861 --> 27:49.381
Carolyn, what happened to you?

27:49.461 --> 27:51.261
- I grew up.
- Don't give me that.

27:51.341 --> 27:52.460
When we worked together...

27:52.580 --> 27:55.860
you were one of the brightest,
most able, mature cops I worked with.

27:55.940 --> 27:59.900
Go ahead, say it. So you saved my life.
I'm trying to return the favor if I can.

27:59.980 --> 28:03.180
I'm not talking about that,
I'm talking about where your head is...

28:03.300 --> 28:05.820
how it got there,
and how we can return it to reality.

28:05.900 --> 28:08.580
Reality. I've had a lot of reality, Steve.

28:10.140 --> 28:12.620
Vice, narcotics, child abuse.

28:12.700 --> 28:15.180
Rich crooks in the streets.
Poor ones in the joints.

28:15.260 --> 28:16.460
Come on.

28:16.540 --> 28:20.099
There isn't a working cop in the country
who hasn't seen the same thing.

28:20.179 --> 28:23.339
Don't I rate a better,
more honest answer than that?

28:25.699 --> 28:26.939
Okay.

28:28.819 --> 28:30.219
I fell in love.

28:32.459 --> 28:36.019
Two years ago, I was assigned
to infiltrate a radical group.

28:36.459 --> 28:39.579
They were small
and it's long since wrapped and put away.

28:41.459 --> 28:44.739
But the leader of that group
was a genuinely brave...

28:45.179 --> 28:47.978
and honorable man
who believed in something.

28:48.058 --> 28:49.938
You fell in love with him?

28:51.338 --> 28:52.418
Yes.

28:53.578 --> 28:55.858
He was willing to die for a cause.

28:56.898 --> 28:59.338
- And did he?
- No.

29:00.138 --> 29:03.098
He's in prison.
Convicted under my testimony.

29:04.898 --> 29:08.978
When the jury brought in the verdict,
I turned in my badge.

29:11.178 --> 29:14.097
- Do you still love him?
- No.

29:14.737 --> 29:18.697
Then what are you doing?
You talk about vice, narcotics, child abuse.

29:18.777 --> 29:21.817
Those are the things
an honest cop spends a lifetime fighting.

29:21.897 --> 29:23.257
Don't push it too far.

29:23.337 --> 29:25.577
You wanna let the other side
solve the problem?

29:25.657 --> 29:28.897
Go ahead. They'll solve it.
With slave labor camps, secret police-

29:28.977 --> 29:30.457
Stop it, Steve.

30:15.175 --> 30:19.335
Diana, I don't think you've met
my Assistant Agent-in-Charge, Tom Baker.

30:19.575 --> 30:21.255
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:22.095 --> 30:24.215
- How are you doing?
- All right.

30:24.935 --> 30:27.335
- Steve?
- Nothing.

30:27.975 --> 30:29.855
Atkinson's flying out.

30:29.975 --> 30:33.895
We've identified the girl
as Carolyn Hamilton, SFPD.

30:34.895 --> 30:36.534
Steve saved her life once.

30:36.654 --> 30:38.894
Apparently, she's gone bad.

30:38.974 --> 30:42.214
But she's been traveling a lot between
San Francisco and L.A.

30:42.294 --> 30:45.534
We just got the address of a rented
apartment in the Los Feliz area.

30:45.614 --> 30:48.414
- You wanna join the raiding party?
- Raiding party?

30:48.534 --> 30:52.814
If there's any chance at all Steve's alive,
the last thing we need is a raiding party.

30:52.894 --> 30:56.254
- It's standard procedure.
- I'm not interested in standard procedure.

30:56.334 --> 30:58.734
Or telling me how to run my office?

30:59.694 --> 31:00.734
Listen.

31:01.774 --> 31:06.333
If there's just one chance to save Steve,
I want it.

31:10.973 --> 31:13.773
- John.
- You've got it.

31:14.813 --> 31:15.853
Thanks.

32:00.971 --> 32:02.411
I'm sorry, I had to come up.

32:02.491 --> 32:04.651
It's all right. They're gone. What's wrong?

32:04.731 --> 32:08.611
While I was waiting for you,
I called home. Somebody's got Ted.

32:09.811 --> 32:12.451
They called Mrs. Garcia,
and they asked for you.

32:12.571 --> 32:13.611
Let's go.

32:18.891 --> 32:19.931
Hello.

32:20.371 --> 32:21.851
Yes, this is Diana Prince.

32:22.371 --> 32:23.771
I have the boy.

32:24.931 --> 32:27.810
- What do you want me to do?
- Now, it's all very simple.

32:28.570 --> 32:31.770
I'll drive by the house. You come out...

32:32.890 --> 32:36.770
the boy gets out of the car,
you get in the car...

32:37.450 --> 32:39.050
and you and I drive away.

32:39.930 --> 32:42.010
Now, if there's anything...

32:42.090 --> 32:45.010
unmarked police cars, other agents...

32:46.250 --> 32:50.570
if there is anything at all, that boy is-

32:50.850 --> 32:53.010
Don't worry. I'll do exactly as you say.

32:53.690 --> 32:55.209
Fifteen minutes.

33:00.569 --> 33:03.329
- Ted will be back in 15 minutes.
- I don't get it.

33:03.409 --> 33:05.689
It's a simple exchange.
It's done all the time.

33:05.769 --> 33:08.809
But that's crazy, I want my kid back.
But that guy-

33:08.889 --> 33:11.889
No. He's a professional.
He'll keep his word. I gave him mine.

33:12.009 --> 33:13.289
Yeah, but I didn't give mine.

33:13.369 --> 33:16.089
We can get this block surrounded
by cops in plainclothes.

33:16.169 --> 33:18.249
No. He'd know.

33:19.529 --> 33:23.088
Listen. You have 15 minutes to wait.
Can you make it?

33:24.288 --> 33:26.088
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:39.688 --> 33:40.768
Pete. No.

33:40.928 --> 33:42.928
Listen. Stay back. I'll handle it.

33:54.567 --> 33:56.887
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

34:05.127 --> 34:06.167
Dad!

34:08.927 --> 34:10.527
- He spoke.
- What?

34:10.726 --> 34:13.367
I said he spoke. He's been silent all his life.

34:13.527 --> 34:15.806
And he just called out to his dad.

34:19.045 --> 34:21.326
- Sit on the other side.
- All right.

35:48.323 --> 35:49.763
Who are you?

35:50.443 --> 35:53.243
- What are you?
- I ask the questions now.

35:53.403 --> 35:56.003
I'm sure you're very good
at getting the answers, too.

35:56.123 --> 35:57.763
Ask anything you like.

35:57.883 --> 36:01.603
But remember, I'm told,
and want to be told...

36:01.763 --> 36:04.083
only those things that I need to know.

36:04.163 --> 36:05.483
That doesn't surprise me.

36:05.563 --> 36:08.642
It's a business with you.
Well, now you're out of business.

36:23.362 --> 36:26.402
We've moved the schedule up.
At 12:30 the governor's aide...

36:26.482 --> 36:29.202
will make the statement of welcome
in the reception area.

36:29.282 --> 36:31.762
Keeping it brief
so they're not in the open too long.

36:31.842 --> 36:34.361
Just as Steve and Diana and I discussed.

36:37.401 --> 36:38.481
Yes.

36:39.841 --> 36:41.641
- Send her in.
- Diana?

36:44.321 --> 36:45.921
Joe.

36:46.001 --> 36:47.361
- How are you?
- Good.

36:47.481 --> 36:49.281
- Have you got anything?
- Yes.

36:49.401 --> 36:51.841
I did some work last night
out at the airport.

36:51.921 --> 36:55.441
Steve's plane arrived at 11:15
on Wednesday, flight 628.

36:55.641 --> 36:58.001
His luggage was offloaded on Ramp 3.

36:58.081 --> 37:01.880
At 11:09,
flight 731 arrived from San Francisco.

37:01.960 --> 37:04.560
The luggage from that flight was
offloaded on Ramp 2.

37:04.640 --> 37:06.480
What are you leading up to, Diana?

37:06.560 --> 37:09.760
I think I begin to see.
Those ramps are only 20 feet apart.

37:09.880 --> 37:13.280
That's right. I showed Carolyn's picture
to the flight crew on 731.

37:13.360 --> 37:16.880
They verified she was on that flight,
used an alias, C. Hammond...

37:16.960 --> 37:18.440
and that she was alone.

37:18.600 --> 37:20.800
- You mean, they met by accident.
- Exactly.

37:20.880 --> 37:24.760
The last time Steve had contact with her,
she was still a cop in San Francisco.

37:24.880 --> 37:28.120
That's right. But suppose
someone was meeting Carolyn.

37:28.200 --> 37:31.319
Someone that knew Steve,
knew they had known each other before...

37:31.399 --> 37:34.879
and didn't wanna take a chance
that Steve might find out the truth.

37:49.479 --> 37:52.199
This will all be over in a few hours,
one way or another.

37:52.279 --> 37:54.919
If I get a chance,
I'll let someone know where you are.

37:54.999 --> 37:57.958
Are you really going
for the Trade Conference ceremony?

37:58.078 --> 37:59.118
Yes.

38:00.758 --> 38:03.638
Don't you realize
how tight security is gonna be?

38:03.718 --> 38:07.158
Don't you realize
the LAPD has a "No Hostage" policy?

38:07.238 --> 38:10.078
Even if you do take hostages,
they're not gonna let you go.

38:10.158 --> 38:12.478
The final decision will be
that of the government.

38:12.558 --> 38:15.078
I do believe we have
some rather persuasive arguments.

38:15.158 --> 38:16.718
I'm sorry, Steve. We've met twice.

38:16.798 --> 38:19.838
I don't think there's a possibility of us
meeting a third time.

38:19.918 --> 38:21.478
I really wish you well, personally.

38:21.598 --> 38:25.597
I'd do a lot better, personally, if I could
keep you from sacrificing your life...

38:25.677 --> 38:27.637
and the lives of who knows
how many others.

38:27.717 --> 38:30.797
Get started. You have 25 minutes
to get to the Trade Building...

38:30.877 --> 38:32.757
and even less time to get into position.

38:32.837 --> 38:33.877
All right.

38:33.957 --> 38:37.077
Too bad you're in such a hurry.
I'd like to hear the speeches.

38:37.197 --> 38:38.397
What speeches?

38:38.477 --> 38:40.277
The speeches he made to convince you...

38:40.357 --> 38:43.677
that you're part of a genuine,
independent, revolutionary movement.

38:43.757 --> 38:44.797
Shut up!

38:44.877 --> 38:47.037
Instead of what he really is. A sleeper.

38:47.117 --> 38:50.197
A traitor. Planted years ago
by the other side.

38:53.796 --> 38:56.516
- Leave him alone.
- I should've gotten rid of him earlier.

38:56.636 --> 38:59.436
Yeah. While I still thought
I was meeting some old friends.

38:59.516 --> 39:01.876
You picked a bad time and place
for a vacation...

39:01.956 --> 39:04.996
if you're telling the truth. Goodbye, Steve.

39:05.636 --> 39:07.756
You said we were running behind.

39:44.875 --> 39:45.954
Miss Prince.

39:46.034 --> 39:48.194
I see you got help from the brass today.

39:48.274 --> 39:51.314
What a nice surprise.
I was planning to call to thank you again.

39:51.434 --> 39:53.274
Well, it's nice to see you.

39:53.394 --> 39:55.554
I'll try to see you later. I gotta run.

40:28.553 --> 40:29.793
Over there.

40:29.873 --> 40:32.913
Those phony I.A.D.C. credentials
worked perfect, didn't they?

40:32.993 --> 40:34.553
Yeah, perfect.

40:45.632 --> 40:47.632
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

40:47.712 --> 40:51.152
Had it been possible, the governor himself
would be with us here today.

40:51.232 --> 40:55.672
Both he and the mayor are at the
statewide conference on the drought...

40:55.752 --> 40:58.592
which, as you know,
has reached critical proportions.

40:58.672 --> 41:02.792
However, they ha ve asked
that we stress the enthusiasm...

41:02.872 --> 41:07.032
and the excitement that we all feel
for this internationally important occasion.

41:07.112 --> 41:10.111
Very nice speech,
but I've got a shorter one and a better one.

41:10.191 --> 41:12.671
Everybody freeze or you'll be killed.

41:12.751 --> 41:14.471
Now get over there! Move it!

41:15.551 --> 41:17.231
Move it! All right.

41:17.751 --> 41:21.711
In this richest city,
in this richest country in the World...

41:21.791 --> 41:24.031
in this gathering of the richest ofnations...

41:24.111 --> 41:27.151
We announce today,
the existence of a movement...

41:27.391 --> 41:29.831
that someday will change all that forever.

41:31.511 --> 41:34.951
We know that security forces
could storm this area...

41:35.031 --> 41:38.190
but I warn you,
killing me or any of these men...

41:38.270 --> 41:40.670
will result in the lives of many here.

41:40.910 --> 41:43.990
At this moment,
rifles are trained on this lectern...

41:44.070 --> 41:47.070
from a vantage point
which you could never reach in time.

41:47.710 --> 41:49.550
What do you want?

41:49.950 --> 41:51.630
Demand number one:

41:52.590 --> 41:55.070
$20 million...

41:55.150 --> 41:59.070
be drawn from federal and private
bank vaults in the next 90 minutes.

41:59.870 --> 42:02.070
Demand number two:

42:02.350 --> 42:03.869
A private jet...

42:04.269 --> 42:06.389
for which we have the crew...

42:06.589 --> 42:09.749
to be serviced
at Los Angeles International Airport.

42:11.389 --> 42:13.749
All right. Hold it. Hold your fire.

42:15.629 --> 42:16.669
Freeze!

42:19.629 --> 42:22.589
Miss Prince's ridiculous escape
changes nothing.

42:56.988 --> 42:59.227
I'm not afraid of you,
do you understand that?

42:59.307 --> 43:01.267
I've never wanted you to be afraid of me.

43:01.347 --> 43:03.547
All I want is to free Steve Trevor.

43:03.667 --> 43:05.467
And let me help you if you want me to.

43:05.547 --> 43:07.587
But you don't understand, I can't go back.

43:07.707 --> 43:11.907
But no one can go back. Believe me.
I know that better than you.

43:12.187 --> 43:15.827
But you can go forward and face
whatever has to be faced and endured.

43:15.907 --> 43:16.947
Freeze!

43:17.587 --> 43:18.907
Please, hold your fire.

43:18.987 --> 43:21.827
Shoot them, Carolyn!
Take them with us. Shoot!

43:27.146 --> 43:29.026
You can't do it, Carolyn.

43:29.106 --> 43:33.186
Any more than you could let someone
take the life of a man who once saved you.

43:33.506 --> 43:37.146
It's a different badge, yes.
But he's doing the same job you once did.

43:45.186 --> 43:46.586
You can't do it.

43:57.665 --> 43:59.225
At least it's ended.

43:59.585 --> 44:01.225
At least it's begun.

44:16.425 --> 44:19.985
Baker, once he'd lost his sharpshooters,
surrendered rather quickly.

44:20.065 --> 44:23.464
He's been arraigned and is being held
in lieu of $1 million bail.

44:23.584 --> 44:26.704
In a series of raids
by federal and state authorities...

44:26.824 --> 44:29.984
we've managed to knock out
all other known groups of the Movement.

44:30.064 --> 44:32.144
What's going to happen
to Carolyn Hamilton?

44:32.224 --> 44:34.944
It's a good question.
She took part in serious crimes.

44:35.024 --> 44:38.104
She also saved Steve's life
and told us where he was being held.

44:38.184 --> 44:39.824
And when she was on that balcony...

44:39.904 --> 44:42.624
she made a choice
that I think any jury will understand.

44:42.704 --> 44:46.624
This taxi driver, Pete Johnson.
Diana, is there some way-

44:46.704 --> 44:49.863
I turned in an expense voucher
for a trip to Disneyland...

44:49.943 --> 44:52.023
for Pete and his son
with all the trimmings.

44:52.183 --> 44:54.823
Little Ted hasn't stopped
talking about it since.

44:55.023 --> 44:57.983
- I'll sign that voucher.
- And so will I.

44:58.463 --> 45:02.743
Well, Steve, We certainly can't take
the last few days of your vacation time.

45:02.823 --> 45:04.463
Do you plan to continue?

45:04.583 --> 45:07.383
Well, I've been giving it some thought, sir.

45:08.023 --> 45:10.183
It's not a bad time of the year
in Washington.

45:10.263 --> 45:13.183
No, not at all. It's just hot,
muggy, crowded with tourists.

45:13.263 --> 45:17.462
And then the air-conditioning unit in your
apartment has been going out regularly.

45:17.982 --> 45:20.222
Would you believe San Francisco?

45:20.662 --> 45:24.302
No way of checking out
Wonder Woman's preference, I suppose?

45:24.702 --> 45:27.262
Steve, San Francisco's
an old and colorful city.

45:27.382 --> 45:29.182
It's sophisticated and fashionable.

45:29.302 --> 45:31.862
I should think it might appeal to the lady.

46:11.660 --> 46:12.660
