00:00.039 --> 00:02.193
Prosecutor: You've been
through a lot, Joss.

00:02.211 --> 00:04.988
Have you considered talking
to someone professionally?

00:05.013 --> 00:08.425
- Previously, on "Mistresses"...
- I'm not really looking for a partner.

00:08.480 --> 00:11.719
Just imagine... You can
do anything you want.

00:11.744 --> 00:13.110
That's what I'm offering you.

00:13.178 --> 00:14.478
I called off the wedding.

00:14.546 --> 00:16.680
The good news is I'm going to stay here

00:16.749 --> 00:18.615
and find the true love of my life.

00:18.684 --> 00:20.917
Woman: Your work just
isn't at the level required

00:20.986 --> 00:22.286
to get into this program.

00:22.354 --> 00:23.787
I was an artist once.

00:23.856 --> 00:26.058
Just not who I am anymore.

00:26.083 --> 00:28.397
- That's my nanny.
- Nanny? Really?

00:33.732 --> 00:37.067
♪ I met someone to navigate me ♪

00:37.136 --> 00:39.569
Okay, Vivian is down.

00:39.594 --> 00:42.196
- We have nothing to worry about.
- You're such a good nanny.

00:42.870 --> 00:45.042
We... we have to be really quiet.

00:45.067 --> 00:46.233
Should we go in the bedroom?

00:46.258 --> 00:47.488
No. Out here. Here is fine.

00:47.513 --> 00:49.673
- I think this is great.
- Okay.

00:49.897 --> 00:51.496
[Panting]

00:51.521 --> 00:52.820
Wait! Hold on!

00:52.845 --> 00:54.044
Are we really gonna do this

00:54.069 --> 00:56.135
and change our
professional relationship?

00:56.188 --> 00:59.423
I vote yes... um, unless you vote no.

00:59.491 --> 01:01.725
But... but, uh... you vote yes, right?

01:01.794 --> 01:04.194
Yes? Yes? Yes?

01:04.263 --> 01:06.730
- Okay.
- Mm. Okay.

01:06.799 --> 01:08.365
That's a yes.

01:08.390 --> 01:10.957
Well, we were never really
all that professional, anyway.

01:10.982 --> 01:12.147

Sync and corrections by Albanda
www.Addic7ed.com

01:14.701 --> 01:17.480
So, look, I know you've
been thinking about the whole

01:17.505 --> 01:20.539
"What else could I maybe be
doing with my life" thing.

01:20.564 --> 01:21.997
I might have a solution.

01:22.022 --> 01:24.140
What kind of solution?

01:24.165 --> 01:25.228
Here.

01:26.672 --> 01:28.572

"Soft Hat, Hard Hat:
What's My Next Career"?

01:32.358 --> 01:34.157
Yeah, I was talking to Jonah,
and he said that he went

01:34.226 --> 01:36.159
through the same thing once,
and that this really helped.

01:36.184 --> 01:39.218
Jonah, the used-car salesman
who now plays bass in the band?

01:39.243 --> 01:41.110
That's who I'm getting advice from?

01:41.266 --> 01:43.200
Hey. I flipped through it, April.

01:43.268 --> 01:44.768
It's actually really cool.

01:44.837 --> 01:47.337
It helps people who are
burnt out rethink their goals

01:47.362 --> 01:49.595
and find their true mission in life.

01:49.620 --> 01:52.199
There's something called the
"Top Hat" exercise in here

01:52.224 --> 01:55.892
where you draw a hat that looks
like the career you want...

01:55.917 --> 01:57.216
or careers.

01:57.241 --> 01:59.708
You get it... wearing different hats?

01:59.733 --> 02:01.967
[Giggles] That makes
no sense whatsoever.

02:01.992 --> 02:04.513
And I already know what
I want and who I am.

02:04.538 --> 02:07.835
I'm a mother, I own a store,
and I'm not looking for a job.

02:07.860 --> 02:09.059
Ah, that's... that's not what I...

02:09.127 --> 02:10.693
The art thing didn't exactly pan out,

02:10.763 --> 02:13.344
but I don't need to
draw or wear any hats.

02:13.369 --> 02:15.536
If you want to draw
hats, go right ahead.

02:15.561 --> 02:17.427
Just a suggestion.

02:17.452 --> 02:20.800
And sweet of you, okay?
But I really don't need it.

02:20.825 --> 02:23.520
Well, I'll leave the
book here just in case.

02:24.099 --> 02:27.220
I got to go... Off to find a date.

02:29.468 --> 02:31.401
- Pass.
- No, no.

02:31.426 --> 02:33.360
Kate, honey, stop being so picky.

02:33.385 --> 02:36.336
We're just looking for some dates, not
a man to spend the rest of you life with.

02:36.361 --> 02:38.866
"I've kissed a lot of frogs,"
isn't that the expression?

02:38.891 --> 02:40.357
Kate: Wait, am I seriously doing this?

02:40.426 --> 02:41.858
I was engaged to Brian two weeks ago,

02:41.927 --> 02:45.061
and now I've decided to move to
Los Angles and start speed dating?

02:45.130 --> 02:46.830
Is this such a good idea?

02:46.899 --> 02:48.365
Yes, yes! It's a great idea.

02:48.434 --> 02:49.900
Come on, no more moping around.

02:49.968 --> 02:52.332
- You need dates.
- What's with this guy's hair?

02:52.357 --> 02:53.523
I kind of like his hair.

02:53.548 --> 02:54.981
- [Laughs]
- Swipe.

02:55.006 --> 02:57.456
Oh, guys, thanks so much for coming over

02:57.481 --> 02:59.352
and helping me with all this nonsense.

02:59.377 --> 03:02.312
Are you kidding? Who doesn't love
a good Saturday morning man-hunt?

03:02.337 --> 03:03.827
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay, so we've got, uh,

03:03.852 --> 03:06.225
dates booked at 5:00 and 7:00.
Do you want to pack in one more?

03:06.250 --> 03:07.516
Is three too many?

03:07.541 --> 03:08.974
What if I really like the first one?

03:08.999 --> 03:10.499
Simple... you just
blow the other ones off.

03:10.524 --> 03:12.094
Here. [Cellphone beeps]

03:12.119 --> 03:13.752
Oh, my God. That's my manny.

03:13.992 --> 03:15.592
- What?
- No.

03:15.661 --> 03:17.961
Is that a problem?
He's available, right?

03:18.030 --> 03:21.128
Well, I don't know how
available he is anymore.

03:22.444 --> 03:24.176
We had sex last night.

03:24.456 --> 03:26.535
- And this morning, too.
- Okay.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.993
I'm officially not giving
you advice ever again.

03:29.018 --> 03:30.551
You sleeping with your manny?

03:30.576 --> 03:32.576
Is that such a good idea?

03:32.601 --> 03:34.701
- Yeah, what's the plan there, Karen?
- [Scoffs]

03:34.726 --> 03:37.627
Robert is amazing,
but let's be realistic.

03:37.652 --> 03:39.719
You know, it's not gonna go anywhere.

03:39.744 --> 03:42.367
But for now, I guess
I can have my manny,

03:42.392 --> 03:43.858
and sleep with him, too.

03:43.883 --> 03:46.017
- Ooh. Ooh.
- Yeah, how was the sex?

03:46.042 --> 03:47.441
No one warned me how uncomfortable

03:47.466 --> 03:48.932
sex would be post-baby.

03:48.957 --> 03:50.389
[Groaning]

03:50.414 --> 03:52.314
I'm gonna pretend I
didn't' hear that last part.

03:52.339 --> 03:53.771
- Hi.
- Mm!

03:53.796 --> 03:55.763
- What's the big occasion, ladies?
- Oh, nothing.

03:55.788 --> 03:57.366
I just wanted the girls to get to know

03:57.391 --> 03:58.657
your sister a little better.

03:58.682 --> 04:00.216
They come over to help me find dates.

04:00.241 --> 04:02.008
- On Shaggr?
- Harry, relax.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.732
Everybody's doing it, okay?

04:03.757 --> 04:05.390
It's like, you know, going to a
bar without leaving your house.

04:05.415 --> 04:07.381
She just... hey, you
just broke up with Brian.

04:07.746 --> 04:09.913
Yes, and if she's moving
here she has to meet

04:09.982 --> 04:11.915
some new people, make some friends.

04:11.984 --> 04:14.284
It's better than her sitting in
her room crying all day, okay?

04:14.353 --> 04:16.653
- She's having fun.
- Fine. I'm staying out of it.

04:16.721 --> 04:18.154
- Hmm.
- I'm out of here...

04:18.223 --> 04:19.856
way too much estrogen for one man.

04:19.925 --> 04:21.701
Oh, Joss, come see this one!

04:21.726 --> 04:24.643
[Laughter] Is that an
ascot he's wearing there?

04:24.668 --> 04:26.068
- Mm-hmm!
- Hmm.

04:26.093 --> 04:28.126
Who the hell organized this place?

04:28.151 --> 04:30.260
I can't find a damn thing on my list.

04:30.285 --> 04:32.656
[Sighs] It was all available online.

04:32.681 --> 04:34.117
Sir, we are very organized.

04:34.142 --> 04:35.608
If you would just let me see the...

04:35.633 --> 04:37.929
Why, so you can tell me that
it's only available online?

04:37.954 --> 04:39.987
Sir, is there a problem?

04:40.012 --> 04:41.511
Yes, there's a problem.

04:41.580 --> 04:43.914
Nothing on the website is in the store.

04:43.982 --> 04:45.916
Well, some items,
like the throw pillows,

04:45.984 --> 04:47.884
are online exclusives
from our warehouse,

04:47.953 --> 04:51.087
meaning if you want them
you can purchase them online.

04:51.156 --> 04:53.757
I need everything at
my house by tomorrow.

04:53.782 --> 04:55.349
I can't move forward with the designer

04:55.374 --> 04:57.236
with only half the list,
and I have a big list.

04:57.261 --> 05:00.379
Fine. Let me have it, and
I'll get everything you need.

05:00.685 --> 05:02.718
And deliver it to Malibu?

05:02.810 --> 05:06.217
Normally we don't deliver,
but since this is a large order

05:06.242 --> 05:08.743
I'll make an exception
and deliver it myself.

05:08.768 --> 05:10.235
You'd do that?

05:10.260 --> 05:12.360
I'd be delighted to drive
all the way to Malibu.

05:12.397 --> 05:14.364
After all, this is my store.

05:14.389 --> 05:16.022
Great.

05:16.047 --> 05:18.581
Now, please, get out of my store.

05:20.884 --> 05:22.017
Okay.

05:24.823 --> 05:26.590
I can be cranky. I'm the boss.

05:28.011 --> 05:30.440
Yeah, it's weird, you know,
'cause it didn't really hurt

05:30.465 --> 05:32.239
when it happened, but then the next day,

05:32.264 --> 05:33.763
I had this... this gnarly bruise.

05:33.788 --> 05:36.155
It was worse than usual.
The pain was deeper.

05:36.180 --> 05:38.580
Or I can't really
explain it. It's just...

05:38.605 --> 05:41.206
You have a stress fracture,
which typically occurs

05:41.231 --> 05:43.165
from abnormal force on a normal bone.

05:43.190 --> 05:46.458
Oh, okay. Um, well, that makes sense.

05:46.483 --> 05:48.120
You take another hit to this rib,

05:48.145 --> 05:49.556
and you'll have a clean break.

05:49.581 --> 05:51.581
Ooh. That does not sound good.

05:51.606 --> 05:53.573
It's unbelievably painful, actually.

05:53.719 --> 05:55.619
[Smacks lips] Okay.

05:55.644 --> 05:56.944
Well, I was just, you know...

05:56.969 --> 05:58.788
pain doesn't really scare
me all that much, so...

05:58.813 --> 06:02.839
It should. Pain is generally
a deterrent for people.

06:02.864 --> 06:06.932
Look... feeling strong
is very important...

06:06.957 --> 06:09.257
not only for your
body, but for your mind.

06:09.282 --> 06:11.849
Exactly, and it's not like this
is some dumb exercise class.

06:11.874 --> 06:14.908
I didn't say it was,
but there is a fine line

06:14.933 --> 06:17.901
between self-empowerment
and self-destruction.

06:17.926 --> 06:19.960
And based on what I'm seeing here,

06:19.985 --> 06:22.418
I'd have to say that
you're at a tipping point.

06:22.443 --> 06:23.976
[Sighs]

06:24.001 --> 06:27.002
You need to take a break, Joss.

06:27.195 --> 06:29.729
And what if I don't?

06:30.155 --> 06:32.756
Well, then you'll find out the hard way.

06:32.824 --> 06:34.624
Good luck.

Let me get that. You are so cute.

Suzie always gets foam on
her mouth when she eats, too.

07:12.898 --> 07:14.097
- Suzie?
- My cat.

07:14.166 --> 07:15.632
Well, one of my cats.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.267
I have five.

07:17.336 --> 07:19.102
You remind me of Sadie, too.

07:20.806 --> 07:23.139
I thought you said you
were an animal lover.

07:23.208 --> 07:24.574
Wow, that's cool.

07:24.643 --> 07:26.443
So, what do you model?

07:26.468 --> 07:29.351
Well, mostly very tasteful,
erotic graphic novels.

07:29.394 --> 07:30.637
Mostly?

07:30.662 --> 07:33.563
Till I found that the real money
is in illustrated sex manuals.

07:35.029 --> 07:37.462
I just got to say... I love your accent.

07:37.487 --> 07:39.865
- You don't have to say that.
- Oh, no, it's the truth.

07:39.890 --> 07:42.591
You know, the best trip I
ever took was to Australia.

07:42.616 --> 07:43.971
I've been dying to go back.

07:44.028 --> 07:46.028
And your accent is crazy cute.

07:47.563 --> 07:49.296
Should we get some food?

07:51.524 --> 07:53.190
Yes.

07:53.817 --> 07:55.616
Hey, just so you know,

07:55.685 --> 07:58.186
I am taking down my Shaggr profile,

07:58.254 --> 08:00.368
so you don't have to worry about that.

08:00.393 --> 08:02.193
I'm not worried.

08:02.218 --> 08:04.327
A guy's got to do
what a guy's got to do.

08:04.352 --> 08:06.152
As does a woman.

08:06.628 --> 08:12.131
Oh, man, Vivian was so adorable
today when you were at work.

08:12.156 --> 08:14.657
We had the most epic tummy time.

08:14.682 --> 08:17.016
- Oh, did you now?
- Oh, yeah.

08:17.041 --> 08:20.609
She was giggling at my little
jokes and all my little dances.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.233
Your jokes?

08:22.258 --> 08:25.364
Yeah, she, uh... she loves
this... this little dance I do.

08:25.389 --> 08:28.357
It's my... it's my Happy
Meal commercial booty dance.

08:28.382 --> 08:30.149
And I got to admit, it's pretty genius.

08:30.174 --> 08:32.554
No offense, but she was
probably passing gas.

08:32.554 --> 08:33.554
Oh, man.

08:33.578 --> 08:36.980
When Vivian laughs,
she looks just like you.

08:39.503 --> 08:40.802
[Vivian cries in distance]

08:41.072 --> 08:43.839
Oh. I recognize that cry.

08:44.043 --> 08:46.944
- That's her hungry cry.
- Mm.

08:47.167 --> 08:48.600
You know what?

08:48.625 --> 08:50.251
Why don't you go?

08:50.276 --> 08:52.533
You haven't spent any
quality time with her today.

08:52.558 --> 08:54.886
What exactly is that supposed to mean?

08:54.911 --> 08:57.545
Well, it's just that
you were at work all day.

09:01.982 --> 09:04.349
Okay, then. I'll be right back.

09:28.842 --> 09:31.543
What in the hell happened to you?

09:31.612 --> 09:34.746
Um, it's just a little
bruise from my class.

09:34.815 --> 09:37.048
Little? Wait. Joss,
Joss, Joss, come here.

09:37.117 --> 09:38.483
- Hey.
- What?

09:38.552 --> 09:40.819
Joss this looks really bad.

09:40.888 --> 09:42.087
- Stop.
- You okay?

09:42.156 --> 09:45.190
My doctor checked it. Nothing's
broken. It's totally fine.

09:45.215 --> 09:46.869
You could have cracked
a bloody rib here.

09:46.894 --> 09:49.294
But I didn't and,
look... [Inhales sharply]

09:49.363 --> 09:51.229
- totally breathing normal again.
- Okay, stop.

09:51.298 --> 09:52.597
Come on.

09:52.666 --> 09:54.566
I-I'm not sure I'm so
good with this class.

09:54.635 --> 09:56.989
And then this whole two-a-day
business? You look great.

09:57.014 --> 09:58.547
You don't have to work out twice a day.

09:58.616 --> 09:59.949
[Laughing] Oh, my God.

10:00.017 --> 10:01.283
That's such a male thing to say.

10:01.352 --> 10:02.885
Harry, it's not about
looking good, okay?

10:02.954 --> 10:04.720
Everyone should know
how to defend themselves.

10:04.789 --> 10:07.957
Okay, sure, but don't you think
this is taking it to an extreme?

10:09.547 --> 10:11.047
Okay.

10:11.072 --> 10:13.873
I will cut it down to once a
day. Will that make you happy?

10:13.898 --> 10:15.998
Well, how about cutting
it back to "nonce" a day

10:16.067 --> 10:17.533
just until you're totally healed.

10:17.602 --> 10:19.001
Come on.

10:19.070 --> 10:20.869
Okay, Harry. Okay.

10:20.938 --> 10:24.039
I'll go back to yoga and
pilates just for a little bit.

10:24.108 --> 10:26.208
- Mm.
- Yeah? Just for you.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.344
- Good.
- [Giggles]

10:28.412 --> 10:29.645
Crazy woman.

10:37.598 --> 10:39.164
Hello?

10:39.266 --> 10:40.832
Hi there.

10:40.857 --> 10:43.069
I wanted to finish
the living room first.

10:43.094 --> 10:44.627
You can decide if you want

10:44.695 --> 10:46.228
to go Moroccan Modern
with everything later on.

10:46.297 --> 10:47.596
What do you think so far?

10:47.665 --> 10:48.998
Just leave those there, just drop them.

10:49.066 --> 10:50.666
Uh, do you need me to sign anything?

10:50.735 --> 10:52.534
No, Michael already
took care of everything.

10:52.603 --> 10:54.770
So, don't leave me in suspense.

10:54.839 --> 10:56.684
You totally love it, right?

10:57.528 --> 11:00.029
Well, obviously, it still
needs the final accents.

11:00.208 --> 11:02.402
Darling, this isn't your loft in Soho.

11:02.427 --> 11:04.523
Moroccan Modern is the way to go.

11:04.548 --> 11:06.515
Everyone with a sense
of adventure's doing it.

11:06.584 --> 11:08.050
[Sighs]

11:08.119 --> 11:10.252
Why are you looking at the
delivery lady for advice?

11:10.321 --> 11:12.187
Actually, I'm not a delivery lady.

11:12.256 --> 11:15.658
This is April Malloy. Uh, she
owns the store that you sent me to.

11:15.726 --> 11:17.459
Uh, maybe she has some thoughts.

11:17.528 --> 11:18.861
Oh, that's sweet, but I'm good.

11:18.929 --> 11:21.196
No, um, just give me a half hour

11:21.265 --> 11:22.965
to shuss things together.

11:23.034 --> 11:26.068
Once you see the full
picture, you'll get it.

11:27.705 --> 11:29.405
I'm sorry, but I can't work with you

11:29.473 --> 11:31.273
staring at me like some scared possums.

11:31.342 --> 11:32.875
Please, go.

11:34.965 --> 11:36.931
Wow. She's a lot.

11:37.548 --> 11:40.616
Yeah, and a lot of money,
too. You didn't like it?

11:40.685 --> 11:42.484
It looks like Morocco threw up in there.

11:42.553 --> 11:43.786
[Sighs]

11:43.854 --> 11:45.921
I'd vote for less showy
and a lot less trendy,

11:45.990 --> 11:48.190
- but that's just me.
- Me too, actually.

11:48.259 --> 11:51.794
Look, I'm sorry I was
such an ass yesterday.

11:51.862 --> 11:53.295
It wasn't about you.

11:53.364 --> 11:54.697
It was about her.

11:54.765 --> 11:56.699
To be honest, I was in
a horrible mood, too,

11:56.767 --> 11:58.600
so it wasn't just you or her.

11:58.669 --> 12:00.202
It was a little bit me.

12:00.271 --> 12:02.771
That sounds like that song
from "The Book of Mormon"?

12:02.840 --> 12:04.173
"You and Me (But Mostly Me)"?

12:04.241 --> 12:06.275
Exactly! I love that show.

12:06.300 --> 12:07.667
Me too!

12:07.692 --> 12:09.258
Michael, get in here.

12:09.413 --> 12:11.313
- [Exhales sharply]
- [Clears throat]

12:11.382 --> 12:13.115
Remember, she works for you.

12:17.553 --> 12:22.823
Bali, Shanghai, London,
and my crown jewel...

12:23.127 --> 12:26.829
Diamond Sunset, a
five-star destination resort

12:26.897 --> 12:30.065
that will surpass anything
you've ever seen in Los Angeles.

12:30.090 --> 12:33.591
And I want you to partner with me

12:33.616 --> 12:36.717
on this spectacular new restaurant.

12:36.742 --> 12:38.641
As well as the beach bistro?

12:40.177 --> 12:42.678
[Scoffs] I get...

12:42.703 --> 12:44.869
I thought you were interested
in partnering on that?

12:44.894 --> 12:47.161
I'm interested in partnering with you.

12:47.318 --> 12:49.718
You have the opportunity to go bigger.

12:49.787 --> 12:51.253
No, no. I've done bigger, Jonathan.

12:51.322 --> 12:52.688
Wunderbar was never my vibe.

12:52.757 --> 12:54.523
No offense, Harry, but
Wunderbar was not big.

12:54.592 --> 12:56.992
And it looked like it was
designed by a super model,

12:57.061 --> 12:59.595
which is why it closed
two months after you left.

12:59.663 --> 13:00.896
[Sighs]

13:00.965 --> 13:02.998
This... this place will be big.

13:03.067 --> 13:05.000
So, wait a second, you
pretended to have interest

13:05.069 --> 13:07.469
in the beach bistro so you
could rope me into this?

13:07.538 --> 13:10.139
I... I just want what's best for you.

13:10.164 --> 13:12.231
Look, it's obviously
very impressive, Jonathan.

13:12.343 --> 13:14.810
But I don't know if this
really connects with who I am.

13:14.835 --> 13:17.669
A restaurant in a hotel
feels less about the food

13:17.694 --> 13:19.593
and more about the bells and whistles.

13:19.618 --> 13:21.379
It's all about the food.

13:21.404 --> 13:24.208
Shiny bells and whistles
will bring people in,

13:24.233 --> 13:26.967
but your food keeps them coming back.

13:27.124 --> 13:30.859
This could make you rich, Harry...

13:30.884 --> 13:32.650
very rich.

13:32.675 --> 13:37.545
And it could be the start
of an incredible partnership.

13:39.283 --> 13:41.103
[Sighs]

13:41.128 --> 13:44.562
Look, Harry, you're...
you're my top choice,

13:44.675 --> 13:47.142
but I have to move on to the other chefs

13:47.211 --> 13:48.929
if you are not interested.

13:50.681 --> 13:52.114
Think about it.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.083
[Clears throat]

13:56.108 --> 13:58.809
I had contracts drawn up.

13:59.223 --> 14:01.356
Take a day and let me know.

14:02.356 --> 14:07.213
This is about who you really want to be.

14:13.971 --> 14:15.337
No, no, I think that's everything.

14:15.406 --> 14:16.672
Thank you. Goodbye.

14:16.740 --> 14:18.907
There's somebody out here to see you,

14:18.976 --> 14:21.143
- but I told her that you were busy.
- Oh, who... who is it?

14:21.212 --> 14:23.579
Well, she says that she's your sister,

14:23.647 --> 14:25.514
but your sister doesn't
live here anymore, right?

14:25.583 --> 14:27.816
So I just figured this
woman is some nutjob.

14:27.885 --> 14:29.418
Oh, no, it's... it's okay, Kylie.

14:29.486 --> 14:30.686
- Okay.
- Yeah, let her in.

14:33.254 --> 14:36.468
She's strict. You left
so early this morning.

14:36.493 --> 14:38.861
I didn't get a chance to tell
you about my date last night.

14:38.929 --> 14:40.462
What happened? What
time did you get home?

14:40.531 --> 14:41.830
It was all kinds of late,

14:41.899 --> 14:43.832
but I had the best
day of my entire life.

14:43.901 --> 14:46.418
Oh, my God! Honey,
that's great! Which guy?

14:46.443 --> 14:49.280
The first two were
disasters... bonzo crazy.

14:49.305 --> 14:52.441
My third with Dean was incredible.

14:52.509 --> 14:54.042
I told you... you need three.

14:54.111 --> 14:56.445
It's weird, but the funny thing is...

14:56.513 --> 14:57.880
Hm? The funny thing is what?

14:57.948 --> 14:59.581
- It might be the guy.
- What guy?

14:59.606 --> 15:01.272
The guy.

15:01.297 --> 15:02.930
It's gonna sound weird after everything

15:02.955 --> 15:06.065
that's gone down lately,
but the guy I could marry.

15:06.610 --> 15:08.523
[Gulps, coughs]

15:10.091 --> 15:11.422
Sorry. [Clears throat]

15:11.447 --> 15:13.051
I told you it would sound crazy.

15:13.076 --> 15:14.943
You know, a little,
'cause you just broke off

15:14.968 --> 15:16.835
your engagement with
Brian two weeks ago.

15:16.901 --> 15:18.667
I am aware of that, and
I know it sounds a little

15:18.736 --> 15:21.870
all over the place, but I'm
not gonna marry Dean right now.

15:21.939 --> 15:24.006
- No. Right.
- That'll take time.

15:24.074 --> 15:28.126
It's just a feeling that I
have that we belong together.

15:29.202 --> 15:30.768
Huh.

15:33.436 --> 15:36.213
I don't get it... you got
enough cash for a down payment

15:36.238 --> 15:38.311
on the place you love,
you're ready to go.

15:38.336 --> 15:40.528
This rich guy sends a
present and shows you

15:40.553 --> 15:42.119
a PowerPoint, and
suddenly you're wavering.

15:42.188 --> 15:43.821
Well, this could be a chance
to do something really big.

15:43.889 --> 15:46.090
- [Scoffs]
- And it would still be my own.

15:46.158 --> 15:48.692
I mean, this could take my
career to a whole new level.

15:48.761 --> 15:50.227
And the last time I had my own place,

15:50.296 --> 15:52.062
it was with Savi's money
and named after her.

15:52.131 --> 15:53.797
And Wunderbar was never mine

15:53.866 --> 15:55.499
and a food truck compared
to what this will be.

15:55.568 --> 15:57.668
That's if I decide to do it.

15:57.737 --> 15:59.269
Well, it sounds like you already have.

15:59.338 --> 16:00.804
No, I have not. I'm thinking.

16:00.873 --> 16:02.239
Good.

16:02.308 --> 16:03.907
I did a little research
into your new partner,

16:03.976 --> 16:05.142
and you should think about this.

16:05.211 --> 16:06.677
The place may not be so much yours

16:06.746 --> 16:08.545
as you think once he
gets through with you.

16:08.614 --> 16:12.149
The dude's all about
money... bottom line.

16:12.218 --> 16:14.318
Look, the bistro could be awesome.

16:14.387 --> 16:17.521
Isn't going for your own dreams
on your own terms big enough?

16:18.924 --> 16:21.058
You know what, Marc? I don't
care what they say about you.

16:21.127 --> 16:22.926
You're a very wise man.

16:22.995 --> 16:25.195
My mom used to say that same thing.

16:25.264 --> 16:27.765
Hey, wait up!

16:27.833 --> 16:29.833
I don't think it's smart
for me to just show up

16:29.902 --> 16:31.669
on your second date with some guy.

16:31.737 --> 16:34.538
Joss, it's just drinks,
and I want your opinion.

16:34.607 --> 16:36.874
My opinion is you're getting
ahead of yourself, honey.

16:36.942 --> 16:39.176
Why, because I already know how I feel?

16:39.245 --> 16:41.311
Sorry. Can I help that?

16:41.380 --> 16:43.981
And Dean said family's
really important to him.

16:44.050 --> 16:45.549
He said that?

16:45.618 --> 16:47.484
On a first date? Okay.

16:47.509 --> 16:49.664
Kate, any guy who says that on
a first date wants one thing...

16:49.689 --> 16:50.998
to get in your pretty, little pants.

16:51.023 --> 16:52.690
Okay, well, maybe those
weren't his exact words,

16:52.758 --> 16:54.491
but we were talking about
family, and he was saying

16:54.560 --> 16:56.060
that all of his friends
were settling down

16:56.128 --> 16:57.528
and he didn't want to
be some pitiful dude

16:57.596 --> 16:58.929
trolling Shaggr for hookups.

16:58.998 --> 17:00.230
Still trying to get in your pants.

17:00.299 --> 17:02.166
I know it sounds nuts.
I'm not denying that.

17:02.234 --> 17:04.134
- That's why I want you to meet him.
- I...

17:06.672 --> 17:09.707
Isn't it possible the
universe can conspire

17:09.775 --> 17:11.241
to bring two people together?

17:11.310 --> 17:13.444
Maybe the whole reason
that I broke it off

17:13.512 --> 17:15.045
with Brian was to meet Dean.

17:15.114 --> 17:16.946
It's a long shot, sure,

17:17.016 --> 17:19.720
but isn't true love always a long shot?

17:20.653 --> 17:22.853
Okay, fine. I'll go.

17:22.922 --> 17:24.655
- [Shouts]
- Okay, geez.

17:24.723 --> 17:26.457
The woman has officially lost her mind.

17:26.792 --> 17:29.632
Don't tell me she's slept
with all three of her dates.

17:29.657 --> 17:31.224
No, no, that might have been better.

17:31.292 --> 17:33.659
Um, instead she found the one
guy that she wants to marry.

17:33.728 --> 17:35.661
- Oh.
- Yes.

17:35.730 --> 17:37.630
From one date on Shaggr.

17:37.699 --> 17:39.565
Thank God.

17:39.634 --> 17:41.467
Thank... God?

17:41.536 --> 17:43.336
Babe, that's just Kate.

17:43.405 --> 17:44.570
This is perfectly normal.

17:44.639 --> 17:46.272
She's not crazy. She's a romantic.

17:46.341 --> 17:48.274
The random sexting? That was crazy.

17:48.343 --> 17:50.109
- No, no. This is very normal.
- [Cellphone chimes]

17:50.178 --> 17:51.411
She's gonna be fine.

17:51.479 --> 17:53.253
Trust me, you watch...
this'll blow over.

17:53.478 --> 17:56.335
Okay. But, really?

17:56.360 --> 17:58.870
So, are you telling me
that I don't need to go

17:58.895 --> 18:00.629
on this date with her tomorrow night?

18:00.654 --> 18:02.287
No, no, I-I still think you should go.

18:02.312 --> 18:03.811
Clearly, she needs help.

18:03.836 --> 18:06.170
Well, then... Ow.

18:06.195 --> 18:07.861
Oh, your bruise is still hurting, huh?

18:07.886 --> 18:09.352
I'm glad you stopped those classes.

18:09.377 --> 18:10.943
Oh! Oh!

18:10.968 --> 18:12.600
How did it go with
Jonathan this afternoon?

18:12.625 --> 18:14.992
- Ugh.
- Oh, no.

18:15.017 --> 18:18.352
He wants me to open this
big schmancy restaurant

18:18.377 --> 18:20.211
in his new hotel on Sunset.

18:20.236 --> 18:22.036
Honey, that should be, like, "Wow!"

18:22.062 --> 18:24.996
Yeah, I'm just worried he's
all about the money, you know?

18:25.021 --> 18:26.520
Is that really such a bad thing?

18:26.545 --> 18:28.211
Because if you accidentally
become a billionaire,

18:28.236 --> 18:29.736
you know, I'm not gonna
kick you out of bed.

18:29.761 --> 18:32.562
Yeah. I just don't think
I can work with someone

37:54.579 --> 37:56.603
So, does this mean I can come back?

37:56.628 --> 37:58.694
As a nanny? Good, God, no.

37:58.719 --> 38:00.719
No, no, no. It's way too weird.

38:01.058 --> 38:05.894
But I would love to date you
like a normal couple would do.

No, but I pulled together a
list of the potential designers

38:44.167 --> 38:47.302
you asked for, and I thought
I'd give it to you in person.

38:49.449 --> 38:51.116
You could have just called me.

38:51.141 --> 38:53.802
Look, I know I don't have
the experience and credentials

38:53.827 --> 38:56.394
that other designers may
have, but I have more energy

38:56.419 --> 38:59.686

dedication to truly being

everything you say...
