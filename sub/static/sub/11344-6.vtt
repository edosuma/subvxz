(male announcer)
In the criminal justice system,

00:02.770 --> 00:06.540
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.574 --> 00:09.377
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:09.410 --> 00:11.179
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:11.212 --> 00:12.680
are members of an elite squad

00:12.713 --> 00:14.415
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.448 --> 00:18.086
These are their stories.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.821
[yelling]

00:20.854 --> 00:23.091
(girl)
Kick, punch, elbow, knee.

00:23.124 --> 00:24.558
Kick, punch, elbow, knee...

00:24.592 --> 00:26.327
Is she having a spaz attack?

00:26.360 --> 00:27.728
No, it's Kraft Magoo.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.098
It's Krav Maga,
it's what they teach

00:30.131 --> 00:31.765
secret agents for self-defense.

00:31.799 --> 00:32.733
Where'd you learn it?

00:32.766 --> 00:33.834
My mom.

00:33.867 --> 00:36.337
They do it in her aerobics
class.

00:36.370 --> 00:37.838
Elbow, kick, punch!

00:37.871 --> 00:40.108
[gunshot blares]

00:40.141 --> 00:41.375
What happened?

00:41.409 --> 00:43.111
Everyone inside the school now!

00:43.144 --> 00:44.478
[gunshot]
Oh!

00:44.512 --> 00:45.779
Somebody's got a gun.
Run!

00:45.813 --> 00:48.449
No pushing!
Just keep your heads down!

00:53.587 --> 00:55.789
(male officer)
As far as we know,

00:55.823 --> 00:56.857
shooter's in the wind.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.559
Kids who were hit?

00:58.592 --> 01:00.428
We've covered EMS with
a ballistic blanket.

01:00.461 --> 01:01.762
Pulled one boy
from the playground.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.098
Alive?
No.

01:05.166 --> 01:06.367
Anyone else?

01:06.400 --> 01:08.636
Two hits, both made it
inside the school.

01:08.669 --> 01:09.803
Leg wound's on his way
to Bellevue.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.406
Here comes the other one.

01:12.440 --> 01:13.407
How is she?

01:13.441 --> 01:15.443
GSW to the left shoulder.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.844
Stopped the bleeding
with a pressure dressing.

01:16.877 --> 01:18.712
Vitals are stable.
I'll ride with her.

01:18.746 --> 01:20.281
Hi. What's your name?

01:20.314 --> 01:21.282
Annabelle.

01:21.315 --> 01:22.283
Hi, Annabelle.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.884
Did you see who shot you?

01:23.917 --> 01:25.219
No.

01:25.253 --> 01:27.821
Did anybody threaten you?

01:27.855 --> 01:29.623
Any of your classmates?

01:29.657 --> 01:30.858
No. It hurts.

01:30.891 --> 01:32.160
I know it does, honey,

01:32.193 --> 01:33.827
and you're being very brave.

01:33.861 --> 01:36.864
What did I do?
Why did they shoot me?

01:36.897 --> 01:39.867
I don't know, sweetie.

02:28.282 --> 02:30.251
(Stabler)
How many kids were out there?
42.

02:30.284 --> 02:31.785
It was an hour before
school started.

02:31.819 --> 02:33.421
Most of the students
hadn't arrived yet.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.522
Where was the shooter?

02:34.555 --> 02:35.956
I don't know.
I never saw a gun.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.258
Have there been any threats?

02:37.291 --> 02:38.792
Recently fired employees,
teachers,

02:38.826 --> 02:40.228
disgruntled parents?

02:40.261 --> 02:42.296
We're a public school,
so all of the above.

02:42.330 --> 02:44.765
I'm gonna need a list, okay?

02:44.798 --> 02:46.367
(Cragen)
We're setting up
a family center

02:46.400 --> 02:48.302
at the Fort Tryon Armory.

02:48.336 --> 02:49.903
We'll return the kids
to their parents there,

02:49.937 --> 02:52.940
but I'm gonna need you
to interview 'em first.

02:52.973 --> 02:54.842
(Stabler)
Just tell me everything
you remember

02:54.875 --> 02:56.410
before the gunshots, okay?

02:58.979 --> 03:03.351
Did you hear anyone
saying angry words?

03:04.618 --> 03:07.455
Where did it sound like
the gunshots came from?

03:07.488 --> 03:09.523
Sidewalk.

03:09.557 --> 03:12.393
The sidewalk?

03:12.426 --> 03:14.762
Did you see anyone
on the sidewalk with a gun?

03:14.795 --> 03:15.929
I didn't see the gun.

03:15.963 --> 03:19.300
But I know it wasn't anybody
on the sidewalk.

03:19.333 --> 03:20.601
Well, okay.

03:20.634 --> 03:23.304
Who was it?

03:23.337 --> 03:25.306
I don't know,
but he was in a van.

03:26.774 --> 03:29.009
What was the color of the van?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.978
I didn't see any van.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.514
So what did you see?

03:33.547 --> 03:34.948
Open windows.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.016
From a car?

03:36.049 --> 03:37.818
No, no.
Building windows.

03:37.851 --> 03:40.020
Across the street.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.255
Which building?

03:41.289 --> 03:42.390
All of them.

03:42.423 --> 03:45.426
People were shooting from
all different directions.

03:45.459 --> 03:47.861
So there was more
than one shooter?

03:47.895 --> 03:49.363
No, just one.

03:49.397 --> 03:50.431
He must've been someone
on the playground.

03:50.464 --> 03:53.033
And you're positive you didn't
see who shot you?

03:53.066 --> 03:54.001
Yes.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.403
(male doctor)
Anyone up for good news?

03:55.436 --> 03:56.570
Yeah, I sure am.

03:56.604 --> 03:57.938
X-rays confirm the bullet

03:57.971 --> 04:00.474
completely missed your femur.

04:00.508 --> 04:01.975
You have a little soft tissue
damage,

04:02.009 --> 04:04.645
but you should be back running
marathons in no time.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.980
But I never ran in a marathon.

04:07.014 --> 04:09.750
Well, you will now.

04:09.783 --> 04:12.386
That is how good
we are gonna fix you up.

04:12.420 --> 04:15.022
So, you have no ballistic
evidence for us?

04:15.055 --> 04:17.057
(doctor)
Clean, through and through.

04:17.090 --> 04:18.859
Your bullet is still
on that playground.

04:18.892 --> 04:19.993
Will you make

04:20.027 --> 04:21.595
Jeffrey and Annabelle
all better too?

04:21.629 --> 04:24.332
Dr. Beresford was just
on his way

04:24.365 --> 04:27.335
to check on Annabelle
for us now.

04:27.368 --> 04:29.303
How is she?

04:29.337 --> 04:31.339
Still in surgery.

04:31.372 --> 04:32.706
I'll let you know.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.342
(boy)
Olivia?

04:34.375 --> 04:36.377
I'm right here.

04:36.410 --> 04:37.478
Johnny Mayhew.

04:37.511 --> 04:39.613
Who's that?
He's a boy in my class

04:39.647 --> 04:41.081
that gets a lot of timeouts.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.483
What about him?

04:42.516 --> 04:43.317
He has a gun.

04:43.351 --> 04:46.754
When did you see Johnny
with a gun?

04:46.787 --> 04:49.557
The first day after
summer vacation.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.725
He brought it to school
in his backpack.

04:51.759 --> 04:55.496
He let me hold it.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.832
A .380 semiautomatic
is not a toy, Mrs. Mayhew.

04:58.866 --> 05:00.534
I told you never
to go near that.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.102
Whoa! You're in enough trouble
already.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.103
What'd I do?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.673
This reeks of cleaning oil.

05:05.706 --> 05:08.876
You covering for your son,
Ms. Mayhew?
I clean it once a week.

05:08.909 --> 05:11.044
So it won't jam
if I ever need to use it.

05:11.078 --> 05:14.047
(Munch)
Safety isn't on,
no lock on the drawer.

05:14.081 --> 05:16.750
I guess a child lock
is out of the question, huh?

05:16.784 --> 05:18.986
You got a permit for that?

05:19.019 --> 05:21.021
It was a gift from my brother.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.423
And you never registered it?

05:22.456 --> 05:23.357
I was supposed to?

05:23.391 --> 05:25.493
Mrs. Mayhew, we're gonna
have to charge you

05:25.526 --> 05:26.794
with possession of a weapon

05:26.827 --> 05:28.762
and endangering the welfare
of a child.

05:28.796 --> 05:29.963
Get outta here.

05:29.997 --> 05:33.434
And a tech needs to run a
gunshot residue test on Johnny.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.536
Why? He hadn't even
left the house yet.

05:35.569 --> 05:39.440
There is no way my Johnny
shot those kids.

05:41.809 --> 05:44.412
(man)
A teacher came in early
to grade some math tests.

05:44.445 --> 05:45.913
Was she in here
during the shooting?

05:45.946 --> 05:47.881
Had just gone to the lounge
for coffee.

05:47.915 --> 05:50.718
A stray round came through
this open window,

05:50.751 --> 05:52.486
pierced the map
right there.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.155
Well, it looks like
he took out Tulsa.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.425
Probably unintentional.

05:57.458 --> 06:00.428
And finally came to rest...

06:01.762 --> 06:02.830
right here.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.398
What caliber was the ammo?

06:04.432 --> 06:07.167
Well, they're all too mangled
to tell, but this one

06:07.200 --> 06:09.903
did give us two points
of contact.

06:09.937 --> 06:11.905
The desk...

06:11.939 --> 06:14.442
and the map, which allows us
to ascertain

06:14.475 --> 06:16.143
the exact line of fire.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.878
My left or your left?

06:17.911 --> 06:19.880
Your left.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.416
The shooter picked 'em off
from right here.

06:22.450 --> 06:23.584
Got something.

06:23.617 --> 06:25.185
Cozy little sniper's nest.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.787
Perfect location.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.189
Complete with
a little hiding place.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.357
What'd he leave us?

06:30.390 --> 06:33.694
It looks like he was smart
enough to pick up his brass.

06:33.727 --> 06:36.730
But remember that line, "Leave
the gun, take the cannoli"?

06:36.764 --> 06:39.199
That explains why no one
saw a weapon afterwards.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.168
Folding stock,

06:41.201 --> 06:43.103
bolt action, internal magazine.

06:43.136 --> 06:45.205
High-powered scope
and a flash suppressor.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.541
I think we can rule out
little Johnny Mayhew.

06:47.575 --> 06:48.175
This is a precision

06:48.208 --> 06:49.710
sniper rifle.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.212
Kind you use with
a specific target in mind.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.915
Which kid was he gunning for?

06:58.886 --> 07:00.888
(Benson)
Can you think of any reason

07:00.921 --> 07:02.456
that somebody may have
targeted your daughter?

07:02.490 --> 07:03.591
Of course not.

07:03.624 --> 07:05.893
What reason could anybody have
to shoot a six-year-old?

07:05.926 --> 07:08.462
What about you?
Have you had any threats?

07:08.496 --> 07:09.897
Any recent disputes?
No.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.799
We just moved here
from Denver last month.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.467
We hardly know anyone.

07:13.501 --> 07:15.869
Detective, you wanted
to be told.

07:15.903 --> 07:19.640
The boy who didn't make it,
his mother just got here.

07:23.043 --> 07:24.778
Mrs. Whitlock.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.547
I'm Detective Benson.

07:26.580 --> 07:29.517
Uh, yes, I got a message that my
son Jeffrey was hurt at school.

07:29.550 --> 07:32.152
And to come here.
Is--is he okay?

07:32.185 --> 07:34.021
I don't understand why
they won't let me see him.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.257
No one's talked to you.
No. W-w-what happened?

07:37.290 --> 07:39.026
W-where is he?

07:39.059 --> 07:40.528
You know what, why don't we
have a seat right over here--

07:40.561 --> 07:42.029
No, no, no, I-I need to be
with my son.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.532
My husband can't have
his cell phone on at work, and--

07:44.565 --> 07:47.501
Only I guess that's what we gave
the emergency contact number

07:47.535 --> 07:49.603
to the school, and h-he picked
it up on break,

07:49.637 --> 07:51.605
and he left a message for me
at home that I--that I--

07:51.639 --> 07:54.542
that I should meet him here,
but he--he didn't--

08:00.548 --> 08:02.616
Mrs. Whitlock.

08:02.650 --> 08:05.252
I'm so sorry.

08:05.285 --> 08:08.288
Please...don't...

08:08.321 --> 08:11.625
There was a shooting
at the school.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.994
Your son didn't make it.

08:18.666 --> 08:21.902
Oh, God!

08:29.577 --> 08:32.512
My husband's here.

08:33.781 --> 08:37.017
I don't know how
I'm gonna tell him.

08:37.050 --> 08:39.152
You're a corrections officer?

08:39.186 --> 08:42.122
Rikers.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.061
[sobbing]
Oh, God!

08:50.831 --> 08:54.935
[sobbing]
Oh...

09:00.874 --> 09:02.776
Your son Jeffrey was...
Adopted.

09:02.810 --> 09:03.977
A year ago.

09:04.011 --> 09:06.714
We couldn't
get pregnant.

09:06.747 --> 09:09.282
They said the wait list
to adopt was years.

09:09.316 --> 09:13.053
Unless you happened to be rich.
Which we're not.

09:13.086 --> 09:17.357
And then we found out there were
20,000 kids in foster care.

09:17.390 --> 09:18.525
Just in New York City.

09:18.558 --> 09:22.730
They said 5,000 were legally
free to adopt, immediately.

09:22.763 --> 09:26.700
Jeffrey was in the
harder-to-place older group.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.669
Kids over seven.

09:28.702 --> 09:29.837
Mark works at Rikers.

09:29.870 --> 09:32.339
Every day he has to deal
with the end results

09:32.372 --> 09:35.342
of ruined childhoods.

09:35.375 --> 09:38.045
Circle of violence.

09:38.078 --> 09:40.614
We thought we were saving him.

09:40.648 --> 09:43.316
Mr. Whitlock, we have to
consider an inmate at Rikers

09:43.350 --> 09:45.653
with a grudge.

09:45.686 --> 09:48.622
We house 17,000 cons there.

09:49.957 --> 09:52.893
Anybody stick out?

09:52.926 --> 09:55.162
I've been spit at, swung at.

09:55.195 --> 09:58.632
I had food, urine, even feces
thrown at me.

09:58.666 --> 10:02.903
I've had my share of threats,
but so has every guard there.

10:02.936 --> 10:05.138
How could they know
who Jeffrey was?

10:05.172 --> 10:08.075
Why take it out on him?

10:08.108 --> 10:11.311
He was so sweet.

10:11.344 --> 10:14.815
I can't believe he's gone.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.988
(Cragen)
You're all going to be reunited
with your children.

10:21.021 --> 10:22.956
The counselors are available
inside.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.358
So please, let your kids
talk to them.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.394
Maddy, thanks for your help,
darling.

10:27.427 --> 10:30.230
Captain, I think
that's about it.

10:30.263 --> 10:31.999
Kids give you anything?

10:32.032 --> 10:33.901
Yeah, about 40 different
versions about what happened.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.303
Well, eyewitness accounts
are bad enough with adults,

10:36.336 --> 10:37.738
what'd you expect from kids?

10:37.771 --> 10:39.206
Wild imaginations,
high suggestibility,

10:39.239 --> 10:41.942
and difficulty distinguishing
fantasy from reality.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.310
That's pretty much
what I got.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.312
Well, we got a dad
of the one fatality

10:45.345 --> 10:47.781
who's a corrections officer
at Rikers.
Really?

10:47.815 --> 10:49.717
(Maddy)
No! I don't want to go home!

10:49.750 --> 10:51.051
Maddy, come on.

10:51.084 --> 10:52.252
Come on, honey.

10:52.285 --> 10:53.721
I interviewed her, nothing.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.723
Well, we'd better
re-interview her.

10:55.756 --> 10:57.758
Come on.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.793
(Huang)
Maddy, where do you live?

10:59.827 --> 11:02.462
In an apartment.

11:02.495 --> 11:04.998
Does anyone live
in the apartment with you?

11:05.032 --> 11:06.299
Yes.
Who?

11:06.333 --> 11:07.701
My mom.

11:07.735 --> 11:12.005
Anyone else?
No.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.708
Maddy, is anyone ever...

11:14.742 --> 11:16.176
mean to you?

11:16.209 --> 11:18.345
Yes.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.280
Who?

11:20.313 --> 11:23.216
I promised not to tell.

11:23.250 --> 11:25.986
What would happen if you told?

11:26.019 --> 11:28.155
He has a giant gun,
as tall as me,

11:28.188 --> 11:29.857
and he said if I told,

11:29.890 --> 11:32.893
he'd shoot my mom
and all my friends.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.228
Maddy, who is he?

11:35.262 --> 11:36.830
If I go home,

11:36.864 --> 11:39.867
he'll shoot me too because
he'll think I told.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.102
But I swear I didn't tell.

11:42.135 --> 11:45.205
What does he do to hurt you?

11:48.208 --> 11:51.812
He makes me pull down my pants.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.982
Please don't let him
shoot my mom.

11:56.216 --> 11:59.186
We won't let him
hurt anybody else.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.255
But you gotta tell me
who he is first, okay?

12:06.794 --> 12:09.462
Maddy.

12:09.496 --> 12:11.899
Who is he?

12:11.932 --> 12:13.901
Mr. Bugeyes.

12:13.934 --> 12:16.003
(woman)
She means Mr. Buggesi.

12:16.036 --> 12:17.838
She has trouble
pronouncing his name.

12:17.871 --> 12:18.772
And who's Mr. Buggesi?

12:18.806 --> 12:21.008
He's an elderly gentleman
in our building.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.509
Retired, he's very friendly.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.344
How often is Maddy
alone with him?

12:26.046 --> 12:27.981
Did he do something to her?

12:28.015 --> 12:30.984
Well, we just need
to speak with him.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.986
Maddy gets out of school
at 3:00,

12:33.020 --> 12:35.222
but I don't get off work
until 5:00.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.991
He says he likes
to keep himself useful.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.927
He watches her for free.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.395
Which apartment is he in?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.233
(man)
Don't! stop!

12:46.266 --> 12:47.434
(man 2)
Do you like that?

12:47.467 --> 12:50.070
Mr. Buggesi?

12:50.103 --> 12:53.273
Mr. Buggesi, open the door!

12:53.306 --> 12:54.975
(man)
You raped your last
little girl,

12:55.008 --> 12:57.244
you rancid bag of puss!
(Cragen)
Hey! Hey!

12:57.277 --> 12:58.912
All right, enough, enough,
enough, enough!

12:58.946 --> 13:00.914
Let go!
Get over here.
Get over here.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.049
Get over here.
Hands against the wall.

13:02.082 --> 13:03.583
Hands against the wall.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.818
He's unconscious.

13:04.852 --> 13:06.119
(Stabler)
Who are you?

13:06.153 --> 13:07.855
SVU Portable to Central.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.589
I need a bus for an aided
prisoner at 54th and 2nd.

13:09.622 --> 13:12.125
Apartment 4-C as in Charlie.

13:12.159 --> 13:13.827
10-4, bus is on the way.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.428
Patrick McCorkle.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.130
Any relation to Maddy?

13:17.164 --> 13:17.998
My niece.

13:18.031 --> 13:19.266
(Stabler)
Looks like Mrs. McCorkle

13:19.299 --> 13:20.467
gave Patrick here the heads-up.

13:20.500 --> 13:21.468
Now, look,

13:21.501 --> 13:23.103
I understand you're very angry.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.304
I don't think you do.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.006
We're still arresting you.
Fine.

13:26.039 --> 13:27.474
Just put us in the same cell.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.177
Buggesi say anything to you
before you scrambled his brains?

13:30.210 --> 13:31.945
He said he was sorry.

13:31.979 --> 13:33.480
That he was born
with unnatural urges,

13:33.513 --> 13:35.548
he couldn't control himself.

13:38.618 --> 13:40.287
Look at this.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.989
That's what
he threatened her with?

13:42.022 --> 13:43.523
It's an air pellet rifle.

13:43.556 --> 13:46.093
A toy.

13:48.095 --> 13:49.897
Looks as real
as a sniper rifle.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.131
Especially to
a seven-real-old.

13:51.164 --> 13:53.200
Yeah, except this one didn't
take out three kids

13:53.233 --> 13:55.135
on that playground.

13:55.168 --> 13:57.037
It doesn't rule out Buggesi
as the shooter.

13:57.070 --> 13:58.538
People can own
more than one gun.

13:58.571 --> 14:00.307
Buggesi was sitting
in a dentist's chair

14:00.340 --> 14:02.175
at the time of the shooting.

14:02.209 --> 14:03.877
Maddy's uncle beat him
almost to death.

14:03.911 --> 14:05.645
Are we even sure
he's a molester?

14:05.678 --> 14:07.247
There's an open warrant on him
from Florida.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.515
They'll extradite,

14:08.548 --> 14:10.250
we won't get a crack at him
until they're done.

14:10.283 --> 14:12.052
What about the weapon Munch
found on the roof?

14:12.085 --> 14:13.420
Any prints?
No.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.055
But the serial number's intact.

14:16.189 --> 14:19.059
John, where are we
with the gun trace?

14:19.092 --> 14:20.227
On a cross-country tour.

14:20.260 --> 14:23.463
It was lovingly manufactured
in Sturgis, South Dakota.

14:23.496 --> 14:26.133
Made its way
to a wholesale distributor

14:26.166 --> 14:27.667
in Brainerd, Minnesota.

14:27.700 --> 14:30.403
Who then shipped it to
a whimsically named little shop

14:30.437 --> 14:31.671
called "Gun Ho!"
on Staten Island.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.573
When?
Less that a month ago.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.642
Gun Ho! sold it last Thursday.

14:35.675 --> 14:37.210
We have a legal purchase?

14:37.244 --> 14:38.045
Complete with loophole.

14:38.078 --> 14:39.279
It's a long gun,

14:39.312 --> 14:41.581
so no background checks
are required.

14:41.614 --> 14:43.216
Cash sale.
Of course.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.152
Buyer's signature
on the affidavit?

14:45.185 --> 14:47.154
Yeah, but it's illegible.

14:47.187 --> 14:49.322
And I guarantee you,
it is bogus.

14:49.356 --> 14:51.358
(Cragen)
Okay, well, looks like, uh,

14:51.391 --> 14:55.095
"S. Brockwull" or, uh,
"Rockwell."

14:55.128 --> 14:56.529
First initial could be "G"?

14:56.563 --> 14:57.530
Who made the sale?

14:57.564 --> 14:58.398
(Munch)
The owner of Gun Ho!

14:58.431 --> 15:00.167
His name is--
[leafing through paper]

15:00.200 --> 15:00.968
Brian Ackerman.

15:01.001 --> 15:03.236
Well, he did
a pretty half-assed job.

15:03.270 --> 15:05.538
He didn't get a clear signature
or a full first name.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.907
Let's go talk
to Mr. Ackerman.

15:10.277 --> 15:12.245
[knock on door]

15:12.279 --> 15:13.947
(Stabler)
Anybody in there?

15:13.981 --> 15:15.482
Hello?

15:15.515 --> 15:18.051
(boy)
I'm sorry.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.020
We're closed.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.955
What is this regarding,
please?

15:21.989 --> 15:24.124
A little young to be working
in a gun store, aren't you?

15:24.157 --> 15:27.127
I'm 16, sir.
My dad's the owner.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.362
What's your name?

15:29.396 --> 15:30.397
Kyle Ackerman.

15:30.430 --> 15:31.999
Your dad leaves you here
all alone?

15:32.032 --> 15:34.534
Yeah, I sweep up
as part of my allowance.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.037
Kyle, you need
to open this door.

15:49.116 --> 15:51.318
(Kyle)
Excuse me.
Do you have a warrant?

15:51.351 --> 15:52.585
For what? We're investigating

15:52.619 --> 15:54.487
the string of burglaries
your dad had.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.123
We thought we'd check
the security system.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.457
Can you come back tomorrow?

15:57.490 --> 15:59.126
You know, I don't
feel comfortable

15:59.159 --> 16:01.361
leaving a kid alone with
all these weapons and ammo.

16:01.394 --> 16:03.563
(Kyle)
I've been around guns
all my life.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.265
You can't be back there, sir.

16:05.298 --> 16:06.733
(Munch)
Just want to check
your security,

16:06.766 --> 16:08.768
make sure your dad doesn't lose
any more inventory.

16:08.801 --> 16:11.171
(Kyle)
We haven't had a burglary
in six months.

16:11.204 --> 16:13.206
I thought you said
there was no one else here.

16:13.240 --> 16:15.108
It's none of your business.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.309
Could be our burglar.

16:16.343 --> 16:17.777
No, it's not.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.112
Hey, look, I'm serious!

16:19.146 --> 16:20.180
You cannot go down there!

16:20.213 --> 16:23.483
Damn, now, there's something
you don't see every day.

16:25.452 --> 16:27.487
So what the hell
do you do here, huh?

16:27.520 --> 16:31.424
Exercise our First Amendment
right to free speech.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.562
"The reason the Jews
made up the Holocaust."

16:35.595 --> 16:38.631
I'm sorry, Star.

16:38.665 --> 16:40.667
Jew?

16:44.371 --> 16:47.240
Hey, excuse me.
Are you this boy's mother?

16:47.274 --> 16:51.078
I'm a friend of the family.
What's your business here?

16:51.111 --> 16:52.779
We're investigating
the shooting at P.S. 74.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.147
What about it?

16:54.181 --> 16:55.215
An African-American boy

16:55.248 --> 16:56.116
was murdered.

16:56.149 --> 16:57.750
With a rifle purchased
right upstairs.

16:57.784 --> 16:59.486
Oh.

16:59.519 --> 17:02.222
You mean that dead little
jungle bunny?

17:03.390 --> 17:05.192
She's all torn up about it.

17:05.225 --> 17:06.193
Hey.

17:06.226 --> 17:07.527
You can't do that.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.129
This is not a police state.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.364
You are destroying
private property.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.100
And you're trespassing.
Well, we were
just leaving.

17:13.133 --> 17:14.267
You mind coming along with us?

17:14.301 --> 17:16.403
I'm not going anywhere with you.
Kike.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.238
Assaulting a police officer.

17:18.271 --> 17:20.140
Well, now you're guaranteed
a ride with us.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.241
Oh, like hell I am.

17:21.274 --> 17:22.775
I don't recognize the authority

17:22.809 --> 17:25.778
of the puppets of the Zionist
Occupied Government.

17:25.812 --> 17:27.580
Kyle, we have rights.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.282
You call your daddy
on your cell phone,

17:29.316 --> 17:33.220
tell him that I am being taken
political prisoner.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.159
Clean up all the crime
in Jew York City?

17:39.192 --> 17:40.660
Or are you just afraid
to do the job

17:40.693 --> 17:42.495
you're actually paid for?

17:42.529 --> 17:44.497
Chasing down gang-banging,

17:44.531 --> 17:47.167
crack-smoking killer
spics and coons.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.868
So you know,
I'm employed here.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.838
Affirmative action, hard
at work, ladies and gentlemen.

17:51.871 --> 17:53.673
Right this way, son.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.342
Wait, wait--well,
now, wait a minute.

17:55.375 --> 17:56.709
You can't separate us.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.878
I demand to act
as his guardian

17:58.911 --> 18:00.547
and be present
when you interrogate him.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.149
Sweetheart,
he's not under arrest.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.082
We're only gonna
let him stay here

18:03.116 --> 18:04.584
till his old man comes
and picks him up.

18:04.617 --> 18:05.685
Do not tell them
anything, Star.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.187
You wait until
my father gets here.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.188
He'll know exactly what to do.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.756
Don't you worry, honey.

18:09.789 --> 18:11.158
Of course he's gonna know
what to do.

18:11.191 --> 18:12.425
He's gonna sue your ass.

18:12.459 --> 18:13.493
I hope you've got yourself

18:13.526 --> 18:15.495
a really good
Shyster Jew lawyer.

18:15.528 --> 18:17.564
(Benson)
White supremacist, huh?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.366
What's that about?

18:19.399 --> 18:20.600
Racial purity.

18:20.633 --> 18:22.269
There's no law
against it.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.237
But there is
against hate crimes.

18:24.271 --> 18:26.306
Now, somebody plastered
your stickers

18:26.339 --> 18:29.409
all over synagogues in three
different boroughs recently.

18:29.442 --> 18:31.644
I distribute information

18:31.678 --> 18:34.614
relating to my group's
ideologies

18:34.647 --> 18:37.317
as permitted by
the First Amendment.

18:37.350 --> 18:38.451
I didn't do that.

18:38.485 --> 18:39.486
(Stabler)
Well, what exactly

18:39.519 --> 18:41.521
do you do, Star?

18:41.554 --> 18:44.491
I help out a friend

18:44.524 --> 18:46.459
whose philosophies
I happen to embrace.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.195
(Benson)
Brian Ackerman
owns a gun store.

18:48.228 --> 18:49.562
And he leads a hate group.

18:49.596 --> 18:52.199
That's an interesting
combination.

18:52.232 --> 18:53.266
You two Neo-Nazis

18:53.300 --> 18:56.436
ever run into a guy
named "Racool," "Rockwall"?

18:56.469 --> 18:57.470
No. Who's he?

18:57.504 --> 19:01.508
He's the man or the woman
who shot up P.S. 74.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.909
At first we couldn't see
a connection

19:02.942 --> 19:05.245
between the victims.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.180
We got Jeffrey Whitlock,
who's African-American.

19:07.214 --> 19:09.516
Danny Kohler,
who's white, but Jewish.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.684
And Annabelle Paoletti,
of Italian descent.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.520
(Benson)
With dark eyes, dark hair.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.888
You make a mistake
on that one?

19:15.922 --> 19:17.757
Well, it must've been,
'cause she is just too pretty

19:17.790 --> 19:19.659
to be Jewish.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.861
Did you see your shooter?

19:21.894 --> 19:23.663
You tell us.

19:23.696 --> 19:25.565
I had nothing to do with this.

19:25.598 --> 19:26.799
Well, the gun
that Rockwell used,

19:26.833 --> 19:29.469
it came from the store
that you work at.

19:29.502 --> 19:31.638
I just go downstairs, help out
a little bit after hours.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.639
I don't work there.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.307
Printing up your love notes.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.608
Mailing out the orders.

19:35.642 --> 19:37.544
They come in faster
than Brian can handle.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.312
Brian's got a mail-order
business.

19:39.346 --> 19:41.581
(Star)
Mm-hmm, on his website.

19:41.614 --> 19:42.649
It's very, very popular.

19:42.682 --> 19:45.418
You should check it out
sometime.

19:45.452 --> 19:47.254
(Huang)

"The official site of RAW.

19:49.289 --> 19:51.224

19:51.258 --> 19:52.659
Hate groups just love
the Internet.

19:52.692 --> 19:53.726
Well, it links

19:53.760 --> 19:55.628
the idiots together,
lets them rant.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.364
And exchange hate tactics.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.898
Ten years ago,
there was one website

19:58.931 --> 20:00.667
advocating racial hatred.

20:00.700 --> 20:02.502
Last number I heard
was nearing 500.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.637
Maybe on the Internet,
but in New York City?

20:04.671 --> 20:05.738
Well, they're everywhere.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.640
On and off the Web.

20:07.674 --> 20:10.477
Watch groups have identified
21 separate hate groups

20:10.510 --> 20:11.578
operating in New York State.

Click on BlitzkriegKids.

20:14.747 --> 20:17.584
(Huang)
Kyle Ackerman has his own site.

20:17.617 --> 20:20.687
Hitler Youth are alive and well.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.589
What does his page offer?

20:22.622 --> 20:24.657
[siren wailing, gunshots]

20:24.691 --> 20:26.593
(man)
Keep runnin', Jew!

20:26.626 --> 20:28.595
Keep runnin'!

20:28.628 --> 20:30.763
The game's called
Final Solution.

20:30.797 --> 20:32.665
Players get to be
a cyber-clansman

20:32.699 --> 20:34.434
or a skinhead gang member.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.270
Chase minorities around
a virtual urban landscape.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.506
Little webmaster-racemeister,
huh?

20:39.539 --> 20:41.574
I have the current high score.

20:41.608 --> 20:45.378
What the hell is JFK Reloaded?

20:45.412 --> 20:48.781
Trust me,
you don't want to go there.
[snaps laptop shut]

20:48.815 --> 20:49.882
They're just games.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.319
There are plenty of games
where white men get killed,

20:52.352 --> 20:54.654
but obviously your kind
has no problem with that.

20:54.687 --> 20:57.890
My kind?
You mean cops?

20:59.626 --> 21:00.627
Niggers.

21:00.660 --> 21:03.863
(Munch)
So, you'd he happy
if somebody

21:03.896 --> 21:05.332
exterminated the two of us

21:05.365 --> 21:06.666
and everybody
that looks like us?

21:06.699 --> 21:08.335
Of course not.

21:08.368 --> 21:10.703
RAW doesn't advocate violence.

21:10.737 --> 21:13.506
We leave that to the savages.

21:13.540 --> 21:15.808
We all know
who those are.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.378
You never had a chance,
did you?

21:18.411 --> 21:19.646
What?

21:19.679 --> 21:21.381
Your father's been
filling your head with hate

21:21.414 --> 21:22.882
since you were a baby.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.584
I actually feel sorry for you.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.053
Oh, don't. I was lucky to be
born a Caucasian.

21:27.086 --> 21:29.556
You were the one who drew
the genetic short straw.

21:29.589 --> 21:31.991
You know, scientists
have discovered

21:32.024 --> 21:33.760
there's really
no genetic difference

21:33.793 --> 21:35.562
between the races.

21:35.595 --> 21:37.630
It's only skin-deep.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.732
Jews?

21:39.766 --> 21:43.836
Are the descendants of the union
between Eve and Satan.

21:43.870 --> 21:46.806
And who do you think
spawned you?

21:51.844 --> 21:52.979
(man)
Kyle!

21:53.012 --> 21:54.914
I need someone to help me
right now.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.716
Preferably someone
who speaks English

21:56.749 --> 21:58.951
with an I.Q. above 60.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.653
The father.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.089
Hello! Who's in charge
of this cesspool?

22:03.122 --> 22:04.824
That would be me, Mr. Ackerman.

22:04.857 --> 22:06.025
Really?

22:06.058 --> 22:07.126
I didn't think they allowed
white males

22:07.159 --> 22:08.495
in positions of power anymore.

22:08.528 --> 22:09.662
Unless, of course,
you're homosexual.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.598
(Benson)
You know, your rant

22:11.631 --> 22:12.865
is even funnier in person

22:12.899 --> 22:14.066
than it is on your website.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.735
Ah, yeah, the requisite
tuna feminist.

22:15.768 --> 22:17.003
Why don't you stay out
of this one, Hillary?

22:17.036 --> 22:18.405
What have you done with my son?

22:18.438 --> 22:19.772
Don't worry, his mind
is just as warped

22:19.806 --> 22:21.541
as you left it.
Kyle!

22:21.574 --> 22:22.975
Dad.

22:23.009 --> 22:25.778
I'd like you two to repeat
what you said about my father

22:25.812 --> 22:27.079
to his face.

22:27.113 --> 22:29.849
Cowards.

22:29.882 --> 22:31.518
I understand you home-school
this boy.

22:31.551 --> 22:33.119
You afraid to expose him
to the truth?

22:33.152 --> 22:34.854
My father's
a brilliant teacher.

22:34.887 --> 22:36.823
He doesn't dumb down
the lessons for minorities

22:36.856 --> 22:37.990
like they do in public school.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.526
Or distort history
to mollify them.

22:39.559 --> 22:40.527
(Benson)
Sweetheart.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.929
He's completely brainwashed you.

22:42.962 --> 22:46.666
You're the idiot
embracing the lies.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.768
Sorry I let you down, sir.

22:48.801 --> 22:49.736
I should never
have allowed them

22:49.769 --> 22:51.037
to breach the perimeter.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.840
We'll talk about this at home.
Let's go.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.875
(Cragen)
Before you go,
you need to describe

22:55.908 --> 22:58.945
the person you sold
the sniper rifle to.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.847
Well, I sell dozens of guns
every day.

23:00.880 --> 23:02.549
I don't remember faces.

23:02.582 --> 23:04.651
Or to follow minimal
sales requirements.

23:04.684 --> 23:05.918
Apparently you've forgotten
the Second Amendment.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.019
It's not my job

23:07.053 --> 23:08.755
to interfere with
an individual's

23:08.788 --> 23:09.989
right to bear arms.

23:10.022 --> 23:11.458
Let's go, Kyle.

23:11.491 --> 23:12.925
Uh, what about Star?

23:12.959 --> 23:14.527
Ms. Morrison assaulted
an officer.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.763
She's still being questioned.

23:18.998 --> 23:21.968
Okay, go wait in the car.

23:23.936 --> 23:25.638
Your detectives entered
my property

23:25.672 --> 23:28.040
without a warrant,
without probable cause--
Eliot.

23:28.074 --> 23:30.009
They made false arrests,
they violated my son

23:30.042 --> 23:31.844
and Ms. Morrison's
constitutional rights--

23:31.878 --> 23:33.212
Detective Stabler,
is this true?

23:33.245 --> 23:34.213
No, sir.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.949
After his son Kyle allowed us

23:36.983 --> 23:37.950
to be on the property,

23:37.984 --> 23:40.687
exigent circumstances led us
into the basement,

23:40.720 --> 23:42.054
where a person we believed
to be an intruder

23:42.088 --> 23:43.456
assaulted Detective Munch.

23:43.490 --> 23:44.457
Liar.

23:44.491 --> 23:45.892
Paranoid?

23:45.925 --> 23:47.694
I'm not gonna stand here
and be insulted.

23:47.727 --> 23:48.795
What, you gotta get back

23:48.828 --> 23:49.696
to your Holocaust denial
buddies,

23:49.729 --> 23:51.030
cook up some more
conspiracy theories?

23:51.063 --> 23:52.064
I'm an academic.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.199
I address historical
inaccuracies

23:53.232 --> 23:54.934
on my website, sir.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.636
Well, while we're clearing up
inaccuracies,

23:56.669 --> 23:58.237
this is the gun purchase
affidavit

23:58.270 --> 24:01.541
that you were kind enough
to fax over to us earlier.

24:01.574 --> 24:03.510
Yes, I believe everything
is in order.

24:03.543 --> 24:04.677
Well, maybe you could
help us decipher

24:04.711 --> 24:08.147
this signature here,
"G. Rockwell."

24:08.180 --> 24:10.216
Now, could that be
George Lincoln Rockwell,

24:10.249 --> 24:12.184
founder of the
American Nazi Party?

24:12.218 --> 24:13.553
I don't see how
it could be, sir,

24:13.586 --> 24:15.722
because he was assassinated
back in '67.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.957
Was the man who bought the rifle
a member of your group,

24:17.990 --> 24:18.825
Mr. Ackerman?

24:18.858 --> 24:20.927
No, I've never
seen him before, sir.

24:20.960 --> 24:25.064
(Stabler)
Describe him.

24:25.097 --> 24:28.501
I believe he was
African-American.

24:28.535 --> 24:30.236
That is still the current
P.C. phrase, isn't it?

24:30.269 --> 24:33.272
I--I don't know, it just changes
so often, I can't keep up.

24:33.305 --> 24:35.808
[phone ringing]

24:36.909 --> 24:38.678
Officer Taylor.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.146
[phone ringing]

24:40.179 --> 24:41.147
What?

24:41.180 --> 24:42.715
This is Mr. Ackerman.

24:42.749 --> 24:44.651
He's the leader of
the RevolutionAryan Warriors.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.018
Escort him
out of here, please.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.887
My pleasure.
This way, Mr. Ackerman.

24:47.920 --> 24:51.958
Get your hands off me,
thank you.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.927
Crime lab pulled DNA off
the padding on the rifle scope.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.195
The shooter was sweating,
gave us a hit

24:56.228 --> 24:57.764
on the DNA database.

24:57.797 --> 25:02.034
It's a convicted felon named
Brannon Lee Redding.

25:02.068 --> 25:03.302
Police!

25:03.335 --> 25:04.937
Go, go, go!

25:04.971 --> 25:06.839
Don't move!
Up against the wall!

25:06.873 --> 25:08.775
Is there a problem,
officer?

25:11.277 --> 25:13.646
Clear!

25:13.680 --> 25:15.314
Lovely place
you have here, Brannon.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.584
Thanks.
I try to keep it nice.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.185
There's no coloreds allowed!

25:19.218 --> 25:21.921
"RaHoWa."
What's that?

25:21.954 --> 25:23.923
(Fin)
Acronym.
Racial Holy War.

25:23.956 --> 25:25.324
Mein Kampf.

25:25.357 --> 25:26.959
I see you're not a member
of Oprah's Book Club.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.127
Are those beer bottle caps?

25:28.160 --> 25:30.697
Pretty cool, huh?

25:32.999 --> 25:34.834
The fat skinhead's
not as dumb as he looks.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.936
Lawyered up
the second we sat down.

25:36.969 --> 25:38.070
We don't get to talk to him.

25:38.104 --> 25:40.106
Munch and Fin said he was pretty
vocal on the ride over.

25:40.139 --> 25:41.941
With racist epithets,
not a confession.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.142
Do we need one?

25:43.175 --> 25:44.744
We've got his DNA
on the murder weapon.

25:44.777 --> 25:46.178
Which he now claims was stolen.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.947
Pretty big coincidence
that the thief

25:47.980 --> 25:50.249
would then shoot the son
of his corrections officer.

25:50.282 --> 25:53.019
Well, the crap a jury
will swallow boggles the mind.

25:53.052 --> 25:54.821
What's the timeline on the gun?

25:54.854 --> 25:57.289
Well, Redding
was released from Rikers

25:57.323 --> 25:58.625
Friday before last.

25:58.658 --> 25:59.792
(Benson)
Then he bought the rifle

25:59.826 --> 26:01.327
the following Thursday

26:01.360 --> 26:03.896
from his fellow white
supremacist Brian Ackerman.

26:03.930 --> 26:06.065
School shooting went down
four days later.

26:06.098 --> 26:08.000
Do we think that Ackerman
was in on it?

26:08.034 --> 26:09.936
Well they're in lock step
ideologically,

26:09.969 --> 26:11.904
but that's the only connection
we have so far.

26:11.938 --> 26:13.806
Ackerman never even visited
Rikers.

26:13.840 --> 26:15.642
What was Brannon in for?

26:15.675 --> 26:18.711
Assault and battery
on an Ethiopian cab driver.

26:18.745 --> 26:19.946
Detective Benson.

26:19.979 --> 26:22.882
Father of the dead boy.

26:22.915 --> 26:24.016
Mr. Whitlock.

26:24.050 --> 26:26.252
I heard you found the guy.
That true?

26:26.285 --> 26:28.120
We think so.

26:28.154 --> 26:30.122
Did he say anything?
Why he did it?

26:30.156 --> 26:32.024
(Novak)
No, we were hoping
that you could

26:32.058 --> 26:33.793
fill in the motive.

26:33.826 --> 26:35.361
Sir, did you ever
have any altercations

26:35.394 --> 26:37.229
with this man at Rikers?

26:42.234 --> 26:44.136
Never.

26:44.170 --> 26:48.775
Brannon Lee Redding.
He wasn't even on my block.

26:51.243 --> 26:53.713
What did you have against
this corrections officer?

26:53.746 --> 26:56.082
Nothing.
He looks like a nice guy.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.685
You killed his son.

26:58.718 --> 27:01.420
How did you know which kid
on that playground was his?

27:01.453 --> 27:04.023
How'd I kill anybody?
My gun was stolen.

27:04.056 --> 27:07.026
One in 35 million.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.995
Now, those are the odds
against it

27:09.028 --> 27:10.863
being anyone else's DNA
on that rifle.

27:10.897 --> 27:12.832
Damn, I hope this Jew lawyer
they gave me

27:12.865 --> 27:15.367
can figure a way around that.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.069
Heshy, have you informed
your client

27:17.103 --> 27:18.037
that if you take this to trial,

27:18.070 --> 27:20.106
he will be judged by a jury
of his peers?

27:20.139 --> 27:21.307
Other skinheads. Great.

27:21.340 --> 27:23.042
No, your human peers.

27:23.075 --> 27:25.712
It's a lovely,
racially diverse group.

27:25.745 --> 27:27.013
What are you offering, Casey?

27:27.046 --> 27:28.247
You first.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.116
What does your client
have to offer?

27:30.149 --> 27:33.085
Just my undying love
and affection.

27:33.119 --> 27:36.122
We'd make pretty white babies
together, don't you think?

27:36.155 --> 27:38.725
Who else was involved, Brannon?

27:38.758 --> 27:40.827
Nobody.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.195
Are you a member of
RevolutionAryan Warriors,

27:43.229 --> 27:44.196
also knows as RAW?

27:44.230 --> 27:46.232
No.
But where do I sign up?

27:46.265 --> 27:47.967
How about in your jail cell
at Rikers

27:48.000 --> 27:49.301
during the year you await trial?

27:49.335 --> 27:51.070
Don't play cute, Casey.

27:51.103 --> 27:52.972
No one's gonna put him
in the same prison

27:53.005 --> 27:55.041
where the alleged victim's
father works.

27:55.074 --> 27:56.475
What, you don't think
word'll travel?

27:56.508 --> 27:58.044
It'll be fun.

27:58.077 --> 28:00.079
You cowering in your cell
24/7.

28:00.112 --> 28:02.348
Afraid to go to chow,
not knowing if someone

28:02.381 --> 28:05.417
put ground glass in your food?

28:05.451 --> 28:07.119
Okay.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.155
Protective custody, 25 to life.

28:09.188 --> 28:11.824
All counts to be served
concurrently.

28:16.095 --> 28:19.065
Now, before we begin, let's
just make sure that everyone

28:19.098 --> 28:21.200
is familiar with the rules
of my courtroom.

28:21.233 --> 28:25.872
I have a zero tolerance policy
for shenanigans.

28:25.905 --> 28:29.108
I appreciate that emotions
are running high.

28:29.141 --> 28:32.378
But you must control them
if you wish to remain.

28:32.411 --> 28:35.347
That means no outbursts
and no foul language.

28:35.381 --> 28:37.917
Capiche, Mr. Redding?

28:37.950 --> 28:39.018
Yes, Your Honor.

28:39.051 --> 28:40.219
I understand you want to change

28:40.252 --> 28:43.155
the plea you made
at arraignment?

28:43.189 --> 28:45.257
Yeah, I want to plead guilty.

28:45.291 --> 28:48.094
Please stand.

28:50.462 --> 28:52.164
You may now allocute.

28:55.401 --> 28:59.839
Describe your crime
for the court.

28:59.872 --> 29:04.210
Uh, I shot the two Jew kids
and the porch monkey.

29:04.243 --> 29:05.945
(woman)
May you burn in hell,

29:05.978 --> 29:07.246
you racist pig!

29:07.279 --> 29:09.048
(judge, banging gavel)
Order!

29:09.081 --> 29:12.118
Madam, sit down
or I'll have you removed.

29:12.151 --> 29:13.886
And as for you,

29:13.920 --> 29:16.856
Mr. Redding, I am rejecting
your plea offer.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.926
But Your Honor,
there's a deal in place.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.393
My courtroom, my decision,
Mr. Horowitz.

29:21.427 --> 29:25.364
And I find this... deal
reprehensible.

29:25.397 --> 29:26.866
You should be ashamed
of yourself

29:26.899 --> 29:30.136
for agreeing to it, Ms. Novak.

29:30.169 --> 29:31.971
I...apologize.

29:32.004 --> 29:33.439
A blatant hate crime,

29:33.472 --> 29:35.574
countless children traumatized.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.276
Two of them maimed.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.178
And one precious young life

29:39.211 --> 29:41.881
snuffed out.

29:41.914 --> 29:43.816
What does Your Honor recommend?

29:43.850 --> 29:47.286
Two options, Mr. Redding.

29:47.319 --> 29:50.589
Withdraw the plea and take
your chances at trial.

29:50.622 --> 29:56.295
Or accept the current offer
of 25 to life for each count.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.865
But to be served consecutively,
not concurrently,

29:58.898 --> 30:01.333
as so egregiously suggested.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.335
If you should choose
to go to trial

30:03.369 --> 30:05.838
and are found guilty,
I will show no leniency.

30:05.872 --> 30:07.974
Your parole officer's parents

30:08.007 --> 30:09.308
haven't even been born yet.

30:09.341 --> 30:11.210
No. No way in hell.

30:11.243 --> 30:12.979
I want the deal I was promised.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.346
Court officers,
remove the prisoner.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.215
Yeah, screw you, old man!

30:16.248 --> 30:17.616
RaHoWa!

30:17.649 --> 30:19.485
[banging gavel]
RaHoWa!

30:19.518 --> 30:20.853
Order!
RaHoWa!

30:20.887 --> 30:22.254
(Star)
Have you been brainwashed

30:22.288 --> 30:24.256
by the Jew-controlled media?

30:24.290 --> 30:25.157
Silence!

30:25.191 --> 30:27.193
Or are you just another
corrupt lackey

30:27.226 --> 30:29.361
of the Zionist Occupied
Government?

30:29.395 --> 30:30.529
Remove that woman.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.231
White power.

30:32.264 --> 30:34.600
The fine for contempt
of my court

30:34.633 --> 30:36.302
is $500, young lady.
What are you gonna do?

30:36.335 --> 30:38.637
You gonna criminalize
the First Amendment?

30:38.670 --> 30:40.039
You've just made it $1,000.

30:40.072 --> 30:41.373
Court officers, lock her up.

30:41.407 --> 30:43.075
Free the political prisoner!

30:43.109 --> 30:44.210
That's 1,500.

30:44.243 --> 30:46.312
Keep counting,
Mr. Judge.

30:51.317 --> 30:54.053
I want a deal, you bitch.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.022
Brannon, I can't talk to you
without your attorney present.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.123
Where is he?

30:57.156 --> 30:59.992
Jewey Jewstein sold me
down the river.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.060
Screw him.

31:01.093 --> 31:03.162
Heshy didn't have anything to do

31:03.195 --> 31:04.496
with Judge Schuyler's decision.

31:04.530 --> 31:08.500
Let's just work this out
between us whites.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.070
For this meeting only,
I waive my right to counsel.

31:11.103 --> 31:13.639
How's that?

31:13.672 --> 31:15.942
As long as you don't
jerk me around

31:15.975 --> 31:18.344
with any more lies this time.

31:18.377 --> 31:20.412
When did I ever lie to you?

31:20.446 --> 31:23.916
You told me that you didn't have
any ties to the group RAW.

31:23.950 --> 31:24.883
I don't.

31:24.917 --> 31:28.620
They seem to be all
warm and fuzzy for you.

31:28.654 --> 31:30.990
You purchased the murder weapon
from their leader,

31:31.023 --> 31:32.324
Brian Ackerman,

31:32.358 --> 31:33.993
and his number one groupie
Star Morrison

31:34.026 --> 31:35.661
is sitting in a jail cell
on contempt charges

31:35.694 --> 31:38.464
for protesting your treatment
in court.

31:39.999 --> 31:43.936
I didn't buy that rifle.
Ackerman gave it to me.

31:43.970 --> 31:45.237
Why would he do that?

31:45.271 --> 31:47.173
He conned me
into doing the shooting.

31:47.206 --> 31:49.541
And Star's involvement?

31:49.575 --> 31:52.711
You think I was dumb enough
to talk about business

31:52.744 --> 31:54.246
in front of some slash?

31:54.280 --> 31:57.249
She walked in
when I was leaving.

31:57.283 --> 31:59.651
She's his old lady.

31:59.685 --> 32:01.720
Who knows what
they talk about in bed.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.089
(Stabler)
I thought you went for

32:03.122 --> 32:06.658
the nice, clean-cut
Nazi types, Star.

32:06.692 --> 32:08.494
What brought you
to the skinhead's hearing?

32:08.527 --> 32:10.963
Curiosity.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.965
Ackerman send you
to keep tabs on him?

32:12.999 --> 32:14.666
Make sure he didn't name names?

32:14.700 --> 32:17.569
I only went to support
a fellow white man.

32:17.603 --> 32:18.570
I figured you would probably

32:18.604 --> 32:19.638
renig on your deal.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.407
I'll tell you what.

32:21.440 --> 32:23.575
When he realized he wasn't
seeing the light of day again,

32:23.609 --> 32:26.512
your boy Brannon's white pride
just flew right out that window.

32:26.545 --> 32:29.315
I've never seen anybody
flip so fast.

32:29.348 --> 32:30.416
What'd he tell you?

32:30.449 --> 32:31.717
All about the alliance between

32:31.750 --> 32:35.387
the skinheads
and your group RAW.

32:35.421 --> 32:36.722
[laughs]

32:36.755 --> 32:39.225
That's news to me.
It shouldn't be.

32:39.258 --> 32:41.660
Brannon says you were there
when Ackerman gave him the gun.

32:41.693 --> 32:43.029
Sold him the gun.
They weren't friends.

32:43.062 --> 32:44.030
Well, they were friendly enough

32:44.063 --> 32:45.031
for Brannon to confide

32:45.064 --> 32:46.332
he'd just gotten out of Rikers.

32:46.365 --> 32:48.100
And Ackerman telling him
that your group

32:48.134 --> 32:50.602
tracks race traitors, and there
was a white guard there

32:50.636 --> 32:54.106
by the name of Mark Whitlock,
who'd adopted a black boy.

32:54.140 --> 32:56.108
This is a prisoner

32:56.142 --> 32:58.244
who has a score to settle
against a guard.

32:58.277 --> 32:59.645
We went through the reports.

32:59.678 --> 33:02.381
Brannon wasn't involved in any
altercations with Whitlock.

33:02.414 --> 33:06.785
RAW prides itself on--
on self-control and discipline.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.487
Ackerman would never get in bed
with the skinheads

33:08.520 --> 33:10.022
over something like this.

33:10.056 --> 33:12.191
He got a hold of the boy's
school picture for him.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.492
And he gave him
the murder weapon.

33:13.525 --> 33:16.762
You're being played.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.464
Whatever.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.199
Conspiracy. Murder Two.

33:20.232 --> 33:22.101
Our ADA will be calling you
to be a witness

33:22.134 --> 33:23.735
against Ackerman.

33:23.769 --> 33:25.337
I can't testify.

33:27.206 --> 33:29.308
I understand you're scared.

33:29.341 --> 33:31.477
I can take care of myself.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.179
We'll offer you protection.

33:33.212 --> 33:34.280
There's no way in hell

33:34.313 --> 33:36.715
I'm gonna testify.

33:39.151 --> 33:41.720
(Novak)
I subpoenaed Star Morrison.

33:41.753 --> 33:43.689
Wouldn't lay odds
on her showing up.

33:43.722 --> 33:46.092
She corroborates the meeting
between Brannon and Ackerman.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.759
If she doesn't testify,

33:47.793 --> 33:49.128
she goes right back in her cell

33:49.161 --> 33:50.429
on her second
contempt of court charge.

33:50.462 --> 33:51.730
Casey.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.800
Did you get my notice
of appearance?

33:54.833 --> 33:57.203
I'm taking over representation
for Brian Ackerman.

33:57.236 --> 33:59.105
How'd you let that piece
of garbage con you, Barry?

33:59.138 --> 34:00.572
It's not a First Amendment case.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.508
It is if you're only
going after him

34:02.541 --> 34:04.443
because you don't like
the things he has to say.

34:04.476 --> 34:06.145
Have you had a conversation
with him?

34:06.178 --> 34:09.715
Yes, and I find every word
he spews morally repugnant.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.818
But his speech,
despicable as it may be,

34:12.851 --> 34:14.786
doesn't entitle anyone
to trample

34:14.820 --> 34:17.189
all over his constitutional
rights, now, does it?

34:21.127 --> 34:23.295
(man)
Do you swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

34:23.329 --> 34:24.463
and nothing but the truth?

34:24.496 --> 34:25.464
I do.

34:25.497 --> 34:26.632
State your name.

34:26.665 --> 34:29.135
I plead the Fifth.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.870
Ms. Morrison,
it's just your name.

34:31.903 --> 34:36.142
I invoke my right
against self-incrimination

34:36.175 --> 34:38.144
as afforded me
by the Fifth Amendment

34:38.177 --> 34:39.478
of the U.S. Constitution.

34:39.511 --> 34:40.712
Ms. Novak, are the People

34:40.746 --> 34:42.848
prepared to offer this witness
immunity?

34:42.881 --> 34:44.483
We already have, Your Honor.

34:44.516 --> 34:45.751
(Schuyler)
Ms. Morrison, I understand

34:45.784 --> 34:48.120
that you have been granted
immunity.

34:48.154 --> 34:49.655
I plead the Fifth.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.657
This witness is dismissed.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.359
(Novak)
Your Honor,
could I please request

34:53.392 --> 34:54.826
a brief recess?

34:54.860 --> 34:57.429
(Schuyler)
Call your next witness,
Ms. Novak.

34:57.463 --> 34:59.431
(Novak)
The People call

34:59.465 --> 35:01.167
Brannon Lee Redding.

35:01.200 --> 35:02.868
Sidebar.

35:02.901 --> 35:04.102
Approach.

35:07.839 --> 35:09.541
You have a problem with this
witness, Mr. Moredock?

35:09.575 --> 35:11.177
I have many problems with
this witness, Your Honor.

35:11.210 --> 35:12.178
First and foremost

35:12.211 --> 35:13.879
that as a co-conspirator,

35:13.912 --> 35:15.914
his testimony must be
corroborated.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.549
Your Honor, we have produced
physical evidence

35:17.583 --> 35:18.717
to corroborate his testimony.

35:18.750 --> 35:20.586
You're referring to
the dead boy's--

35:20.619 --> 35:23.589
[arguing]

35:23.622 --> 35:25.157
Mr. Moredock, I'm allowing
this witness.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.558
Your Honor--

35:26.592 --> 35:27.893
Step back,

35:27.926 --> 35:29.328
Mr. Moredock,
I've made my ruling.

35:29.361 --> 35:31.397
It's a bad ruling.

35:31.430 --> 35:32.898
Mr. Moredock.
You're allowing

35:32.931 --> 35:36.602
your personal beliefs to, uh,
to cloud your legal judgment.

35:36.635 --> 35:38.870
You are perilously close
to contempt, sir.

35:38.904 --> 35:41.573
I'm just trying to protect
my client's rights, Your Honor.

35:41.607 --> 35:45.277
In this country, even Neo-Nazis
have them.

35:45.311 --> 35:47.413
They have the right to assemble,
the right to free speech.

35:47.446 --> 35:49.581
And as much as
it just kills you two,

35:49.615 --> 35:50.582
the right to a fair trial.

35:50.616 --> 35:53.452
You will have a chance
to present your case.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.322
Call the next witness,
Ms. Novak.

35:56.355 --> 35:58.890
Mr. Redding, when did you
first meet the defendant

35:58.924 --> 36:00.192
Brian Ackerman?

36:00.226 --> 36:01.960
About a week after I got out.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.230
And what happened
at that meeting?

36:04.263 --> 36:07.633
He sees my tattoos, finds out
I just got out of Rikers.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.601
Starts trying to bait me.

36:09.635 --> 36:10.702
How?

36:10.736 --> 36:12.338
Says skinheads are all talk.

36:12.371 --> 36:13.372
Says his group's

36:13.405 --> 36:14.240
more organized.

36:14.273 --> 36:15.907
Says, "I got a whole list
of targets."

36:15.941 --> 36:18.310
And there should be one
I'm especially interested in.

36:18.344 --> 36:20.512
And what target was that?

36:20.546 --> 36:24.650
The adopted Sambo of some
white Rikers security guard.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.453
He gave me his home
and school address.

36:27.486 --> 36:28.954
He even gave me
his school picture.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.956
Race traitor!

36:30.989 --> 36:31.990
Kyle!

36:32.023 --> 36:33.859
Court officers!
Court officers!

36:35.661 --> 36:36.628
(Ackerman)
Kyle!

36:36.662 --> 36:37.829
Drop it!

36:42.901 --> 36:45.437
[groaning]

36:49.408 --> 36:51.510
Kyle, you're not
getting out of here.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.645
We all have to make sacrifices.

36:56.515 --> 36:58.016
Drop your weapon!
Federal agent.

36:58.049 --> 36:59.918
Hold your fire!
Federal agent.

36:59.951 --> 37:02.954
Federal agent, don't shoot.

37:04.323 --> 37:05.991
Kyle?

37:06.024 --> 37:07.225
Kyle.

37:13.332 --> 37:16.402
(Munch)
FBI?
I can't believe you're a Fed.

37:16.435 --> 37:18.970
You can understand now
why I couldn't testify.

37:19.004 --> 37:20.672
Yeah, you would've
committed perjury

37:20.706 --> 37:22.641
just by stating your name.

37:22.674 --> 37:24.009
Which is...

37:24.042 --> 37:26.478
Dana Lewis.

37:26.512 --> 37:29.315
Detective Munch,

37:29.348 --> 37:32.851
I apologize for everything
I had to say.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.387
You have no idea
how reprehensible

37:35.421 --> 37:37.289
I find those words.

37:37.323 --> 37:40.392
But I had to maintain
my cover.

37:40.426 --> 37:42.027
How long were you under?

37:42.060 --> 37:44.463
I infiltrated
about five months ago

37:44.496 --> 37:46.765
and worked my way up the ranks.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.301
Here comes your partner.

37:49.335 --> 37:52.003
Excuse me.
And you take care.

37:52.037 --> 37:55.040
Detective Tutuola,
I want to apologize to you for--

37:55.073 --> 37:56.842
We're good.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.577
All right.
Take care.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.814
So where is it you got shot?

38:02.848 --> 38:04.015
That would be in the ass.

38:04.049 --> 38:05.917
You want to kiss it
and make it better?

38:05.951 --> 38:06.985
You be nice to me

38:07.018 --> 38:09.955
or you won't get the shake
I smuggled in for you.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.423
Fig? From McClinty's?

38:11.457 --> 38:12.824
Of course.
Oh, thanks, man.

38:12.858 --> 38:13.992
Thank you for not making me

38:14.025 --> 38:16.628
have to break in
another partner.

38:16.662 --> 38:19.998
I'm glad you pulled through,
bro.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.668
Did anyone call Kathy yet?
No. Don't.

38:22.701 --> 38:24.903
Eliot.
Don't be like that--

38:24.936 --> 38:27.673
She started divorce proceedings.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.375
When?

38:29.408 --> 38:31.810
A couple weeks ago.

38:31.843 --> 38:35.881
I have the papers at home,
I just haven't signed 'em yet.

38:38.116 --> 38:39.818
How'd they get the guns in?

38:39.851 --> 38:43.489
Uh, Christopher Rawlings
was the adult shooter.

38:43.522 --> 38:45.691
He's a member of RAW,
he had a fake badge and I.D.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.693
Don't have to go through
the metal detector.

38:47.726 --> 38:48.560
They waved him right around.

38:48.594 --> 38:50.429
Handed off the gun
to Kyle Ackerman.

38:50.462 --> 38:52.130
Any casualties?

38:52.163 --> 38:54.966
One of the court officers
is still touch and go.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.134
The other one didn't make it.

38:56.167 --> 38:59.671
And, uh, neither
did Judge Schuyler.

39:01.907 --> 39:03.709
You talk with Brian Ackerman?

39:03.742 --> 39:05.377
He said that he was

39:05.411 --> 39:08.414
proud that his son Kyle
died a hero.

39:08.447 --> 39:10.582
Fighting for his race.

39:18.123 --> 39:21.159
Hey, Ms. Benson.
Our sting went down.

39:21.192 --> 39:23.094
What'd you get?

39:23.128 --> 39:25.564
Two prime targets purchasing
about 50 pounds

39:25.597 --> 39:26.832
of ammonium nitrate, urea,

39:26.865 --> 39:29.401
and a bunch of other fixin's
for a bomb.

39:29.435 --> 39:31.770
It's an exact replica of the one
McVeigh used in Oklahoma City.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.104
What was the target?

39:33.138 --> 39:35.106
We don't know.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.776
Well, at least you got 'em.

39:37.809 --> 39:40.479
You're gonna like this.

39:40.512 --> 39:41.680
During the subsequent raid,

39:41.713 --> 39:45.751
we found some information that
may be pertinent to your case.

39:50.456 --> 39:52.458
(Benson)
There are no pictures
of Jeffrey.

39:52.491 --> 39:58.029
Jana's had a hard time
dealing with his death.

39:58.063 --> 40:01.533
Counselor recommended
removing all reminders.

40:01.567 --> 40:04.069
She must've kept
some little keepsake.

40:04.102 --> 40:08.574
A school project,
a favorite toy?

40:08.607 --> 40:10.108
What is this about?

40:10.141 --> 40:13.178
This is about just how precious
your son was to you.

40:13.211 --> 40:15.481
According to the two
insurance policies

40:15.514 --> 40:16.948
that you took out on him,

40:16.982 --> 40:19.217
Jeffrey was worth exactly

40:19.250 --> 40:20.719
$750,000.

40:20.752 --> 40:22.187
What?

40:22.220 --> 40:23.889
(Lewis)
A bit excessive.
Don't you think?

40:23.922 --> 40:24.723
I mean, considering

40:24.756 --> 40:26.658
that the average
life insurance policy

40:26.692 --> 40:29.461
on a child is only $50,000.

40:29.495 --> 40:31.129
It's what our insurance broker
recommended.

40:31.162 --> 40:32.130
(Benson)
And you had no problem

40:32.163 --> 40:34.766
paying the $350 a month premium?

40:34.800 --> 40:35.767
(Lewis)
I think you would.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.469
Seeing as how you filed

40:37.503 --> 40:39.471
for bankruptcy
only two years ago.

40:39.505 --> 40:41.640
You don't have to rich to give
a child a home.

40:41.673 --> 40:44.943
(Benson)
You filed the insurance claim
five days after Jeffrey died.

40:44.976 --> 40:47.779
You couldn't wait, could ya?

40:50.281 --> 40:51.983
This is insane.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.255
These were obtained
from an FBI raid

40:57.288 --> 40:58.924
of a skinhead terrorist group.

40:58.957 --> 41:00.992
You were mentioned by name,
Mr. Whitlock.

41:01.026 --> 41:03.128
(Benson)
It shows the amount
that you pledged them

41:03.161 --> 41:07.232
from a future
insurance payment.

41:07.265 --> 41:11.202
Somebody's setting me up.

41:11.236 --> 41:13.171
One-third of $750,000.

41:13.204 --> 41:15.206
How would they know
the exact amount

41:15.240 --> 41:17.275
of your combined policies?

41:17.308 --> 41:19.545
(Benson)
Brannon didn't get your son's
picture from Ackerman.

41:19.578 --> 41:20.912
You're the one

41:20.946 --> 41:23.114
who provided them
with Jeffrey's school picture.

41:27.819 --> 41:30.221
You two adopted
this beautiful child

41:30.255 --> 41:32.190
just to kill him, didn't you?

41:33.258 --> 41:34.760
You don't understand--

41:34.793 --> 41:36.828
(Benson)
People must've been surprised
that knew you.

41:36.862 --> 41:40.966
Two racists like you
adopting a little black boy?

41:46.605 --> 41:49.107
We're not racists.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.177
We just needed the money.

41:54.780 --> 41:54.846
