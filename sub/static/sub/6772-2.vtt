...Elements of Harmony...
See: Mare in the Moon?

00:06.463 --> 00:08.041
But that's just an old ponies' tale...!

00:08.189 --> 00:10.133
...she will bring about nighttime eternal...!

00:10.151 --> 00:12.711
...it's imperative that
the Princess is told right away...

00:13.323 --> 00:15.902
...See? I knew she would wanna
take immediate action...

00:16.061 --> 00:20.127
...My dear Twilight. There is more to
a young pony's life than studying...

00:20.370 --> 00:21.761
...Make some friends...!

00:23.597 --> 00:26.329
...All the ponies in this town are CRAZY...!

00:27.756 --> 00:29.317
...I hope the Princess was right...

00:29.463 --> 00:31.091
...She's gone...!

00:31.654 --> 00:34.419
...Oh no. Nightmare Moon...!

01:17.842 --> 01:21.075
Seize her! Only she knows
where the Princess is!

01:21.637 --> 01:23.991
Stand back, you foals!

01:31.587 --> 01:32.645
Come back here!

01:34.885 --> 01:37.412
Nighttime? Forever?

01:39.694 --> 01:41.101
Where's she going?

01:43.367 --> 01:46.167
We gotta stop Nightmare...!

01:48.835 --> 01:53.460
You've been up all night, Spike.
You are a baby dragon after all.

01:57.973 --> 01:59.638
Elements, elements, elements...

02:00.302 --> 02:03.345
How can I stop the Nightmare Moon
without the Elements of Harmony?!

02:03.346 --> 02:05.894
And just what are the Elements of Harmony?!

02:05.895 --> 02:08.341
And how did you know about
Nightmare Moon, huh?

02:08.342 --> 02:09.741
Are you a spy?

02:11.261 --> 02:14.597
Simmer down, Sally. She ain't no spy.

02:14.953 --> 02:18.943
But she sure knows what's going on.
Don't you, Twilight?

02:21.919 --> 02:24.252
I read all about the
prediction of Nightmare Moon.

02:24.288 --> 02:28.590
Some mysterious objects called the Elements of
Harmony are the only things that can stop her.

02:28.812 --> 02:33.010
But I don't know what they are. Where to
find them. I don't even know what they do!

02:33.170 --> 02:35.423
