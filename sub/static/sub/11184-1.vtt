WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.481
I'm gonna take you hunting.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.977
Next, on Airwolf.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.787
I wanna see that prisoner.

00:09.977 --> 00:13.823
You go sticking your butt in where it's
not wanted and it's gonna get kicked.

00:17.417 --> 00:20.125
It was a UFO. It was aliens, Sheriff.

00:20.387 --> 00:21.525
Look, you've gotta help me.

00:21.788 --> 00:23.563
I'm not bust’n anybody out of jail.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.335
Come on, out the back.

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074

02:46.600 --> 02:49.581
County 1, this is helo
Papa 5 following from above.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.274
Do you need assistance?

03:01.481 --> 03:03.427
County 1, this is helo Papa 5.

03:03.483 --> 03:04.484
Do you read?

03:22.069 --> 03:24.345
Damn county mounty. Doesn't
even know when he needs assis…

03:26.006 --> 03:28.282
County 1, break it off, break
it off! There's a ravine ahead.

03:28.341 --> 03:29.820
He'll never see it in time.

03:30.110 --> 03:31.282
That's right.

03:55.235 --> 03:57.146
County 1, I'll radio Desert City Memorial

03:57.204 --> 03:58.808
and tell ‘em to expect a trauma case.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.681
I can have him there in 15 minutes.

04:01.341 --> 04:03.651
This is Sheriff Bogan.

04:03.710 --> 04:06.247
I'll be returning this boy to county jail

04:06.313 --> 04:07.621
for medical attention.

04:08.415 --> 04:10.019
I don't think you understand, Sheriff.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.255
I can have him to the hospital

04:11.318 --> 04:12.991
before you can have him to the highway, over.

04:19.959 --> 04:22.497
I understand. I'm the Sheriff of Pope County

04:22.562 --> 04:24.872
and you're a flying meter maid. Over.

04:44.851 --> 04:47.491
Unless you want me to
shoot this escaping prisoner,

04:47.554 --> 04:50.000
I'd back that Dustbuster off.

04:59.566 --> 05:01.739
I mean it, meter maid.

05:28.128 --> 05:29.766
Would you get that?

05:30.697 --> 05:31.903
String.

05:34.701 --> 05:36.772
Would you get the phone, please?

05:39.139 --> 05:41.449
By the time I get there, it'll stop ringing.

05:42.108 --> 05:43.553
Humor me.

05:51.451 --> 05:55.126
It'll probably stop ringing just
about the time I get within…

05:57.424 --> 05:58.869
10 feet.

05:59.526 --> 06:01.528
Okay, so you were right.

06:05.432 --> 06:07.105
Well, now what are you doing?

06:07.167 --> 06:09.374
Well, it rang so long it must be important.

06:09.436 --> 06:11.746
They'll probably call back,
just in case they misdialed.

06:18.411 --> 06:19.856
Santini Air.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.621
I have a collect call for a Stringfellow Hawke

06:22.682 --> 06:23.888
from a James Blake.

06:23.950 --> 06:25.190
Will you accept the charges?

06:25.252 --> 06:26.390
Sure.

06:28.688 --> 06:30.167
Go ahead, sir.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.634
Jimmy, where the hell are you?

06:31.691 --> 06:33.261
Outside of Hondo, Texas.

06:33.326 --> 06:36.170
Only I ain't Jimmy. I'm sort of a pal.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.230
Sort of?

06:37.297 --> 06:40.574
Yeah, well me and Jimmy were doing
time together in the county jug.

06:40.634 --> 06:43.046
Well, what'd he do this time?

06:43.103 --> 06:46.676
He cut across some local
ponderosa on his dirt bike.

06:47.240 --> 06:49.083
They don't like that in Texas.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.055
Well, where do I send the bail money?

06:51.111 --> 06:53.421
Oh heck, partner, he don't need no bail.

06:53.513 --> 06:54.992
We busted out this morning.

06:55.048 --> 06:55.992
Damn.

06:56.049 --> 06:59.724
That place is a hellhole.
Sheriff's a mean dude.

06:59.786 --> 07:01.823
Jimmy's running for Mexico on his bike

07:01.888 --> 07:05.461
and I caught myself a ride with a
gorgeous blonde in a Mercedes.

07:05.525 --> 07:08.631
Oh man, it's a hitcher's dream come true.

07:09.930 --> 07:11.500
Anyway, ole Jimmy,

07:11.564 --> 07:13.737
he told me to give you a
call in case he couldn't.

07:13.800 --> 07:14.972
You heard from him?

07:15.035 --> 07:16.036
No.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.742
Guess there ain't no phone
booths out in the desert?

07:18.805 --> 07:20.682
- Gotta go.
- Hey, wait a minute.

07:20.740 --> 07:22.344
I ain't got it. My ride's waiting.

07:22.409 --> 07:24.013
Well, what jail did you bust out of?

07:24.077 --> 07:25.920
Pope County, Texas.

07:41.628 --> 07:45.166
Why do I get the feeling that
that call was collect?

07:45.732 --> 07:46.802
'Cause it was.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.409
You remember me telling you about Jimmy Blake?

07:51.638 --> 07:52.742
No.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.453
Air Cav, he pulled me out of Indian territory

07:55.508 --> 07:57.146
when I went down one time.

07:58.011 --> 07:59.854
He's in trouble in Texas.

07:59.913 --> 08:01.358
What kind of trouble?

08:01.414 --> 08:03.451
Some sort of trespassing violation.

08:04.617 --> 08:06.893
Problem is he busted out of jail.

08:08.588 --> 08:10.226
Yeah, he's heading for Mexico and…

08:10.290 --> 08:13.169
Wants you to pull him out of Indian territory.

08:14.728 --> 08:15.832
Yeah.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.366
Well, let me point out
one thing to you, String.

08:18.431 --> 08:22.777
You don't bust out of jail for
trespassing, and Texas ain't Vietnam.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.376
Maybe Jimmy just doesn't see it that way.

08:26.873 --> 08:30.912
How are you gonna find a guy
who's running for the border?

08:37.116 --> 08:40.188
Oh, no! Oh, no!

08:40.253 --> 08:42.893
I kind of liked it around
here for the last 2 months.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.692
Nobody in white suits bugging us.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.933
Nobody in jets buzzing us.
Nobody shooting at us.

08:49.229 --> 08:53.769
Nothing more exciting than just the
usual, routine in-flight emergency.

08:54.968 --> 08:58.973
I kind of like to fly helicopters
the old-fashioned way

08:59.039 --> 09:00.882
like God intended.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.255
You through?

09:05.278 --> 09:07.952
Yeah, I just had to get it off my chest.

09:22.662 --> 09:25.142
Hey, you gotta admit one thing.

09:25.832 --> 09:28.005
She sure gets your heart to pumping.

09:31.871 --> 09:33.248
Sure does.

09:40.547 --> 09:43.027
Did you miss me, sweetheart?

09:44.617 --> 09:46.062
Dom, it's only a machine.

09:46.119 --> 09:49.931
Hey, she's got feelings. Ain't you, baby?

09:53.827 --> 09:55.465
Temperature's dropping.

09:55.862 --> 09:57.637
Just vented the hydraulics.

09:57.697 --> 09:59.938
Sure, String. Sure.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.312
There you are.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.343
You ready?

11:11.938 --> 11:13.042
Ready.

11:43.436 --> 11:45.177
3 months doesn't seem to have bothered her.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.047
All systems are in the green.

11:47.106 --> 11:48.608
Then what are we waiting for?

11:49.142 --> 11:51.088
Oh, I was hoping you'd say that.

12:13.967 --> 12:15.241
What was that one?

12:16.936 --> 12:19.576
Cheetah. $10,000.

12:23.343 --> 12:26.290
Ocelot. $15,000.

12:27.413 --> 12:29.393
Sure would like to shoot me an ocelot.

12:30.149 --> 12:32.459
Well, that's why I'm in
the business, isn't it?

12:39.559 --> 12:41.402
That there's old Sam.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.532
First big cat I ever brought back from Africa.

12:45.932 --> 12:48.879
He's been the boss man
on this range for 10 years.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.005
Anybody ever shoot him?

12:51.871 --> 12:53.350
Shot at him.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.612
Some say they shot him good, too.

12:57.210 --> 13:00.020
But nobody ever brought
that old boy down, though.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.692
How much?

13:03.316 --> 13:04.818
$50,000.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.224
Sure would be worth it.

13:10.189 --> 13:12.635
Houston, I'd sell my soul for a good hunt.

13:25.505 --> 13:27.451
What have you got?

13:27.507 --> 13:30.420
Not much. We're still 100 miles out.

13:31.444 --> 13:35.085
According to the computer, the
town has less than 200 people,

13:35.148 --> 13:36.991
only 4 major structures.

13:37.083 --> 13:38.994
2 seem to be gas stations.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.021
One's gotta be the county jail

13:41.087 --> 13:42.828
and the other's probably a bar.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.028
It'll be just another West Texas cow town,

13:45.091 --> 13:47.162
if it wasn't for that fence.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.603
Fence?

13:48.661 --> 13:51.301
Snap your electro-magnetic
sensors on, will you?

13:55.101 --> 13:56.171
What is it?

13:56.235 --> 13:58.841
Electrified fence. A big one.

13:58.905 --> 14:03.081
5,000 volts. It runs at least
50 miles in and out of that town.

14:03.943 --> 14:05.320
Government installation?

14:05.378 --> 14:07.221
Not according to the chart.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.623
What are we gonna do?

14:09.982 --> 14:11.518
Set me down outside of town.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.564
I'll find out what I can about Jimmy's escape.

14:13.619 --> 14:16.065
And what do I do? Twiddle my thumbs

14:16.122 --> 14:18.830
hiding out behind that big fence somewhere?

14:19.359 --> 14:22.203
So, what are you afraid of?
It's just to keep people out.

14:22.462 --> 14:23.770
Yeah?

14:24.130 --> 14:26.132
What if it's to keep something in?

15:21.387 --> 15:22.661
Excuse me.

15:22.722 --> 15:24.668
Now why would I want to do that, little lady?

15:24.724 --> 15:27.227
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna
take you off at the knees.

15:27.293 --> 15:29.330
Oh, you are, are you?

15:29.395 --> 15:31.397
Back off, Buck.

15:32.598 --> 15:34.578
Sure thing, Sheriff.

15:43.643 --> 15:45.020
Thank you.

15:45.978 --> 15:48.219
I'm Deputy Caitlin O'Shaughnessy,

15:49.115 --> 15:51.061
Texas Highway Patrol,

15:51.851 --> 15:53.125
Aerial Division.

15:56.622 --> 15:59.865
I'm the flying meter maid, as you put it.

16:03.529 --> 16:04.530
May I sit down?

16:04.597 --> 16:05.632
No.

16:07.633 --> 16:10.409
I was over to your lockup to see
that prisoner you ran down today.

16:10.470 --> 16:12.416
Your Deputy said I'd have
to get your permission.

16:12.472 --> 16:13.917
That's right.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.317
Well, l would like to see him, please.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.780
No.

16:19.612 --> 16:21.319
That man was hurt.

16:21.380 --> 16:24.520
Now, I don't give a damn
what he did or was wanted for.

16:24.584 --> 16:26.154
He needed immediate medical attention

16:26.219 --> 16:28.927
and he didn't get it because you
buffaloed me out of doing my job.

16:28.988 --> 16:30.262
You're not going to do it again, Sheriff.

16:30.323 --> 16:32.132
I wanna see that prisoner.

16:34.293 --> 16:36.170
Meter maid,

16:36.229 --> 16:40.609
you go sticking your butt in where it's
not wanted and it's gonna get kicked.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.913
No matter how cute it is.

16:48.474 --> 16:49.817
Okay, Sheriff.

16:50.409 --> 16:53.083
Looks like we'll do this the hard way.

17:12.865 --> 17:15.175
Sheriff Bogan, you're a geek.

17:16.167 --> 17:18.478
Okay, we'll see how cool you are

17:18.538 --> 17:21.541
when I come back with a court
order from Judge Blackmore.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.793
Yeah, try that when I'm on duty.

17:37.857 --> 17:39.803
It's gonna cost you $200.

18:05.851 --> 18:07.091
Hello?

18:08.020 --> 18:09.522
Hello?

18:50.596 --> 18:53.099
You looking for me, sweet britches?

18:58.904 --> 19:01.748
I'm a Deputy with the Texas Highway Patrol.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.082
Well, what are you gonna do, sweet britches?

19:04.210 --> 19:06.247
Write us up a parking ticket?

19:07.113 --> 19:09.650
Don't be stupid. Now, we can
forget about this right now.

19:09.715 --> 19:10.955
But if you lay a hand on me…

19:11.017 --> 19:12.018
Then what?

19:12.084 --> 19:13.119
This!

19:19.925 --> 19:22.531
That was the biggest mistake of your life.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.671
Get her car, Billie.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.577
Tie her down, boys.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.742
No!

19:48.054 --> 19:49.055
Hold it.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.201
Let the girl go.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.462
I said, let her go.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.309
Let her go.

20:53.819 --> 20:55.389
I'd call it a night, boys.

21:04.697 --> 21:07.041
You gotta be kidding me, cowboy.

21:43.068 --> 21:45.605
It was a UFO. That's what it was, Sheriff.

21:45.671 --> 21:47.150
A UFO.

21:47.206 --> 21:49.618
It weren't no UFO. It was a chopper.

21:49.675 --> 21:52.622
You ever see a chopper big
enough to blow over a pickup?

21:52.745 --> 21:54.486
It was aliens, Sheriff.

21:54.547 --> 21:56.549
Damn it, Billie, it was a chopper.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.896
Probably one of them secret
military jobs out of Fort Hood.

21:59.952 --> 22:02.125
What's the matter with your voice, Billie?

22:04.523 --> 22:07.129
She chopped me in the throat
when I wasn't looking.

22:07.193 --> 22:08.695
When he wasn't looking.

22:09.562 --> 22:11.701
At least she didn't drop-kick me.

22:11.764 --> 22:13.573
You boys wouldn't be trying to feed me

22:13.632 --> 22:15.202
a bucket of hogwash, would you,

22:15.267 --> 22:18.339
'cause you rolled your pickup
trying to run that meter maid down?

22:30.115 --> 22:31.526
What's going on, boys?

22:31.584 --> 22:35.088
It's UFOs, Mr. Houston. With aliens in ‘em.

22:35.154 --> 22:36.599
It was a chopper.

22:36.655 --> 22:38.100
What's wrong with your throat, Billie?

22:39.358 --> 22:43.067
Mr. Houston, you think a chopper
could knock over my pickup?

22:43.295 --> 22:46.606
J.J., what you been giving these boys?

22:48.167 --> 22:50.272
Too much drinking money.

22:50.936 --> 22:52.347
Sheriff, we're telling you the truth,

22:52.404 --> 22:53.474
and that's the gospel.

22:53.539 --> 22:54.745
I am.

22:54.807 --> 22:56.514
That's the gospel, Sheriff.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.453
I know these boys don't have the brains

23:01.513 --> 23:02.890
of a dead armadillo between ‘em,

23:02.948 --> 23:04.655
but something's got ‘em spooked.

23:04.717 --> 23:06.719
Whatever it is, I'll handle it.

23:07.953 --> 23:09.591
You always have, haven't you, J.J.?

23:09.655 --> 23:10.929
You bet.

23:13.158 --> 23:15.035
Got a hot one for you tomorrow.

23:16.262 --> 23:17.536
Can't help you.

23:17.997 --> 23:19.999
What about that hitchhiker and that biker?

23:20.065 --> 23:21.976
They busted out this morning.

23:23.269 --> 23:24.680
Sorry to hear that, J.J.

23:25.871 --> 23:29.148
This boy was gonna pay us
$100,000 for a special hunt.

23:53.132 --> 23:54.634
He still may.

24:09.114 --> 24:11.094
You got any ID, boy?

24:12.351 --> 24:14.092
Why? Did I do something?

24:15.955 --> 24:18.834
It got stolen with my car outside of El Paso.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.131
How'd you get here?

24:20.192 --> 24:21.330
I hitched.

24:21.393 --> 24:22.804
Got money?

24:22.861 --> 24:24.534
I got enough for this beer.

24:24.596 --> 24:26.132
How about something to eat?

24:26.732 --> 24:28.370
No, thanks.

24:28.434 --> 24:30.004
County's buying.

24:34.540 --> 24:36.076
I'm no vagrant, Sheriff.

24:36.976 --> 24:39.388
You are in Pope County, boy.

24:43.515 --> 24:45.688
Does that mean I can't take my beer?

25:07.606 --> 25:11.019
Catch you with your boots
on my desk again, Bobby,

25:11.076 --> 25:13.386
and your mama's gonna be wearing black.

25:13.512 --> 25:14.923
Yes, sir.

25:14.980 --> 25:16.186
Have a seat, boy.

25:16.248 --> 25:17.318
Listen, Sheriff. You don't have…

25:30.529 --> 25:31.974
Name?

25:32.898 --> 25:34.104
James Blake.

25:36.335 --> 25:37.973
Hey, Sheriff,

25:38.937 --> 25:41.383
that's the same name as that biker.

26:03.062 --> 26:04.871
You trying to be funny, boy?

26:05.531 --> 26:08.410
No, sir. That's my name.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.708
Why? Did somebody come
through here using my ID?

26:12.771 --> 26:14.944
Yeah, a biker.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.015
Still here?

26:17.076 --> 26:18.419
No, he escaped yesterday.

26:18.477 --> 26:19.649
Took out of here on that big bike…

26:19.711 --> 26:21.122
Bobby!

26:23.482 --> 26:25.120
You know what I think, boy?

26:25.684 --> 26:27.095
No, sir.

26:32.458 --> 26:35.496
I think you're a smart mouth up to someth’n.

26:36.128 --> 26:39.337
Sheriff, my car and my ID
were stolen in El Paso.

26:39.398 --> 26:40.877
Couple days ago.

26:44.903 --> 26:47.008
I think you're lyin’, boy.

27:01.787 --> 27:03.824
I'm gettin’ too old for this.

27:05.324 --> 27:08.669
Bake all day and freeze all night.

27:12.097 --> 27:14.577
What does String think I am anyway?

27:15.434 --> 27:16.708
A machine?

27:17.970 --> 27:20.541
Oh, sorry honey, no offense.

27:21.607 --> 27:26.022
But you… you were made for
all that adventure in the sky.

27:26.512 --> 27:28.287
Blasting all over the place.

27:29.748 --> 27:32.058
Blowing over pickup trucks.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.829
Yeah, that's all right for String and you,

27:38.957 --> 27:41.130
but when you get to be my age,

27:41.193 --> 27:44.402
you kind of like to know what's
gonna happen in advance, you know?

27:45.731 --> 27:48.940
And not be surprised
every time you turn around.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.301
Jumping jack rabbits.

29:14.620 --> 29:16.258
Sheriff Bogan ain't gonna like that.

29:16.321 --> 29:19.097
Sheriff Bogan ain't gonna
like a lot of things.

29:19.157 --> 29:20.659
I take it he isn't here?

29:20.726 --> 29:22.034
No.

29:22.294 --> 29:23.773
Fine, you'll do.

29:25.230 --> 29:27.073
These are 4 John Doe warrants

29:27.132 --> 29:28.543
for the arrest of those local yokels

29:28.600 --> 29:30.443
who tried to kidnap me last night.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.846
- Huh?
- "Huh?" Yeah, I know.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.611
You don't know nothin’ about it.

29:35.540 --> 29:38.350
This is from Judge Blackmore in San Antone.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.979
It orders you to produce that prisoner

29:40.045 --> 29:42.491
I saw Sheriff Bogan run to ground yesterday,

29:42.547 --> 29:45.084
out north of the African Hunt Club Ranch.

29:45.150 --> 29:46.390
The biker?

29:46.451 --> 29:48.158
If that's what you call him.

29:48.654 --> 29:50.361
Well, he got away.

29:51.089 --> 29:53.535
You are trying my patience, Deputy.

29:53.725 --> 29:56.103
I'm tellin’ you he ain't here.

29:58.964 --> 30:00.375
Not here, huh?

30:00.432 --> 30:03.709
That ain't the biker you're
looking for. That's James Blake.

30:03.835 --> 30:05.280
That was the biker's name, too,

30:05.337 --> 30:07.749
but he stole this guy's ID in El Paso.

30:08.173 --> 30:09.481
You're not him.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.248
Are you looking for James Blake?

30:11.310 --> 30:14.519
If that's the biker I saw Sheriff Bogan
run to ground yesterday, yes.

30:14.579 --> 30:16.684
Sheriff said he got away.

30:17.149 --> 30:19.151
I sure would like a word with you, Miss…

30:19.451 --> 30:21.761
Deputy, Caitlin.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.963
I'm Stringfellow Hawke.

30:24.022 --> 30:25.968
You lied to the sheriff?

30:26.892 --> 30:27.996
Yeah.

30:28.293 --> 30:29.772
I sure did.

30:30.462 --> 30:32.169
I still need to talk with you.

30:32.497 --> 30:33.635
I'm listening.

30:33.699 --> 30:35.474
I'm getting Sheriff Bogan.

30:35.534 --> 30:37.241
You do that, Deputy.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.412
All right, Mr. Hawke,
what have you got to say?

30:41.473 --> 30:43.077
Nice kitty.

30:44.743 --> 30:47.553
Why don't you go lay down
in the shade somewhere?

30:48.180 --> 30:50.854
Gotta be hot out there in the sun.

30:51.216 --> 30:52.786
It's hot out of the sun.

30:54.086 --> 30:56.362
I can't run the air conditioner

30:56.421 --> 30:57.923
'cause I'll run down the batteries.

30:58.056 --> 31:01.435
And if I run down the
batteries, I can't start the…

31:01.526 --> 31:02.869
You don't care, do you?

31:02.928 --> 31:04.999
Of course you don't care.

31:05.063 --> 31:08.704
Oh, sure. Go on, go on. Go ahead, lay down.

31:08.767 --> 31:12.271
That's it, go on. Take over. Sure.

31:12.337 --> 31:14.908
Call a few of your pals. Throw a little…

31:18.043 --> 31:19.522
Look, you've gotta help me.

31:19.578 --> 31:22.149
If Jimmy is alive, I may be his only chance.

31:22.214 --> 31:23.591
How are you gonna find him?

31:23.648 --> 31:25.628
Well, I kind of think like him.

31:25.684 --> 31:27.960
I'd probably start where you saw him last.

31:28.220 --> 31:31.201
I'm gonna nail Sheriff Bogan's
butt on a couple of counts,

31:31.256 --> 31:32.826
including the murder of your
friend, if he did that.

31:32.891 --> 31:35.201
But I'm not bust’n anybody out of jail.

31:35.794 --> 31:37.205
You're her.

31:37.295 --> 31:38.501
What?

31:39.297 --> 31:40.298
I…

31:40.966 --> 31:43.378
You kind of look like a lady I met recently.

31:44.536 --> 31:46.413
Listen, if you won't get me out,

31:46.471 --> 31:49.042
at least let me make a phone
call to a friend who will.

31:49.107 --> 31:51.883
What? Sheriff Bogan didn't
let you make a phone call?

31:51.943 --> 31:53.752
Does it look like it?

31:56.314 --> 31:57.418
No.

32:01.186 --> 32:02.961
You try anything, cowboy,

32:03.021 --> 32:05.627
I'm gonna make what he did
to you look like love taps.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.234
I know.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.512
Come on.

32:18.970 --> 32:20.540
Get up and get out of here, will you?

32:20.605 --> 32:22.448
I don't wanna have to shoot you.

32:25.911 --> 32:27.618
And take them with you.

32:31.249 --> 32:33.024
Well, it's about time.

32:33.585 --> 32:35.690
Yeah, I got myself in a bit of a problem.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.357
So did I.

32:37.422 --> 32:39.163
I need you to get me out
of the Pope County jail

32:39.224 --> 32:40.999
just as soon as you can take off.

32:41.126 --> 32:43.868
Just as soon as I can get
the camouflage net off.

32:43.929 --> 32:45.465
Great.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.705
There's only one thing.

32:47.766 --> 32:50.269
I can't get the net off until the lions move.

32:51.837 --> 32:53.339
Say again?

32:53.405 --> 32:55.146
You heard me, String.

32:55.207 --> 32:58.916
I'm surrounded in here in this
cockpit by a bunch of lions.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.480
There must be at least 6 or 7 of ‘em.

33:01.947 --> 33:03.187
Lions?

33:03.248 --> 33:05.159
Is your friend hunting on the ranch?

33:06.418 --> 33:08.398
Yeah, sort of.

33:08.954 --> 33:10.763
You know, anybody who hunts
those beautiful cats

33:10.822 --> 33:12.529
ought to be hunted themselves.

33:15.527 --> 33:16.835
Dom, Sheriff's here.

33:16.895 --> 33:19.205
You'll have to bring your sweetheart
if you want to get me now.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.578
A prisoner is entitled to a
free phone call, Sheriff.

33:21.633 --> 33:24.614
One more word, meter maid, and you're dead.

33:24.703 --> 33:26.205
Don't threaten me, Sheriff. I won't have…

33:26.271 --> 33:27.648
Caitlin.

33:30.809 --> 33:34.018
Boy just saved your life for now.

33:36.548 --> 33:38.152
Lock her up, Bobby.

33:38.550 --> 33:39.961
Yes, sir.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.190
But, Sheriff…

33:43.655 --> 33:45.430
You lied to me, boy.

33:46.091 --> 33:47.331
You killed Jimmy, didn't you?

33:47.392 --> 33:48.735
Deader than hell.

33:48.793 --> 33:50.136
I suppose that means you're gonna kill me now.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.505
Can't afford to kill you, boy.

33:52.931 --> 33:55.036
I'm gonna take you hunting.

34:06.711 --> 34:09.692
He's got about 80,000
acres to hide in out there.

34:09.947 --> 34:12.428
Of course, most of it's open desert.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.562
Not much like Vietnam, huh?

34:16.221 --> 34:17.427
No, sir.

34:18.089 --> 34:19.864
Sure wish I could have made that one.

34:21.626 --> 34:23.161
Why didn't you?

34:23.895 --> 34:27.536
My Mother was an invalid
and I had to take care of her.

34:32.003 --> 34:33.572
Hey, I got something.

34:38.208 --> 34:41.088
I wouldn't be holding down
on J.J. when he pulls up here.

35:07.072 --> 35:08.983
Raise your right hand, boy.

35:18.550 --> 35:22.259
You swear to uphold the laws
of Texas and Pope County?

35:25.924 --> 35:27.335
Yes, sir.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.900
You're now an official Deputy.

35:31.096 --> 35:33.201
I got a prisoner loose out.

35:34.933 --> 35:36.879
You can lower your hand, boy.

35:41.473 --> 35:44.010
I got an escaped prisoner out there.

35:45.410 --> 35:46.650
Go get him.

35:48.613 --> 35:49.751
Yes, sir.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.545
How are we ever gonna find him?

36:14.606 --> 36:16.552
He'll run the arroyo to keep out of sight.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.781
We'll cut his tracks in one of them.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.447
After that, he's dead meat.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.082
Yeah, dead meat.

37:06.758 --> 37:07.998
Bingo.

37:51.536 --> 37:53.015
She sure is feisty, Sheriff.

37:53.071 --> 37:54.550
Been threatening to bring in everybody

37:54.606 --> 37:56.381
from the Governor to the National Guard.

37:56.975 --> 37:58.511
Buck's at The Rack.

37:58.576 --> 38:00.681
Tell him to bring the boys over.

38:00.812 --> 38:02.849
They'll take the feistiness out of her.

38:12.323 --> 38:14.325
Do you have to do that, Sheriff?

38:16.227 --> 38:18.229
If you got a good pack of hounds, Bobby,

38:18.296 --> 38:20.606
you gotta give them a
little meat now and then.

38:22.667 --> 38:24.044
Yes, sir.

38:46.724 --> 38:48.704
Don't just sit there, man. Take your shot.

39:03.308 --> 39:05.879
Who taught you how to shoot? Your Mother?

39:15.920 --> 39:18.264
He's just around the next bend.
I'll get him this time.

39:18.323 --> 39:19.700
Shut up.

39:24.529 --> 39:25.803
What's that?

39:31.369 --> 39:33.144
Well, I'll be hung.

40:07.238 --> 40:09.309
Yeah, you would break your neck.

40:18.917 --> 40:20.021
Damn.

40:24.789 --> 40:26.769
You know, I still don't believe it.

40:26.824 --> 40:29.134
It worked, didn't it? I got the net off

40:29.193 --> 40:31.139
and they let you walk right between them.

40:31.195 --> 40:32.435
Yeah, but to what?

40:32.497 --> 40:35.103
I don't wanna hear any more about it.

40:35.566 --> 40:37.409
ETA in 3 minutes.

40:39.137 --> 40:40.980
She's a chopper pilot?

40:41.039 --> 40:43.576
Yeah, for the Texas Highway Patrol, no less.

40:45.176 --> 40:46.314
What's her name?

40:46.744 --> 40:47.814
Sweet britches.

40:53.151 --> 40:54.152
You get her, Buck.

40:54.218 --> 40:55.424
Yeah, I will.

40:59.557 --> 41:00.558
I will.

41:00.625 --> 41:03.162
Come on. What you afraid of?

41:03.995 --> 41:06.236
Well, if you're so anxious,
why don't you come get her?

41:22.714 --> 41:24.819
Well, that's twice, sweet britches.

41:24.882 --> 41:26.919
But you ain't gettin’ no third time.

41:41.599 --> 41:42.669
Sheriff!

41:44.702 --> 41:45.942
Yeah?

41:59.884 --> 42:01.830
Give me chain guns, 1 and 2.

42:01.886 --> 42:03.524
Chain guns, 1 and 2.

42:39.490 --> 42:40.969
It's them. It's the aliens.

42:41.025 --> 42:43.005
They've come back for her.

42:44.495 --> 42:45.997
Mornin’, Sheriff.

42:46.631 --> 42:47.803
Aliens.

42:47.865 --> 42:49.742
I told you it was a chopper.

42:49.801 --> 42:53.248
I'm gonna make this real easy, even for you.

42:54.172 --> 42:57.051
You got 30 seconds to send out the girl.

42:57.275 --> 42:58.618
Get her out, Bobby.

42:58.676 --> 42:59.916
Yes, sir.

42:59.977 --> 43:02.480
You can't let her go, Sheriff.
She can identify us.

43:02.547 --> 43:04.185
I didn't say we were gonna let her go.

43:04.248 --> 43:05.784
Let's get the guns.

43:14.659 --> 43:16.036
I ain't gonna hurt you.

43:16.094 --> 43:17.505
They were wrong doing what they did

43:17.562 --> 43:18.666
and I don't want no part of it.

43:18.729 --> 43:20.367
Now, come on, out the back.

43:21.065 --> 43:23.341
Hey, String, 2 people goin’ out the back.

43:37.081 --> 43:39.925
There she is. I hope he's letting her go.

43:46.824 --> 43:47.928
Sheriff!

44:06.844 --> 44:09.017
Oh, my God. Let's get out of here.

44:17.021 --> 44:19.297
Come on, Sheriff. Don't make me do it.

44:21.459 --> 44:22.460
Damn.

44:48.753 --> 44:50.494
God in heaven.

45:01.098 --> 45:02.372
Are you okay?

45:02.833 --> 45:05.507
Yeah. Stringfellow Hawke?

45:06.037 --> 45:07.482
She knows you?

45:08.906 --> 45:10.476
She's guessing.

45:11.142 --> 45:12.587
Who's that?

45:13.311 --> 45:15.518
Well, whoever you are, thanks.

45:17.081 --> 45:18.617
You're welcome.

45:22.987 --> 45:24.295
Hey, wait a minute.

45:37.602 --> 45:39.104
Hey, you can't leave.

45:39.604 --> 45:40.674
Why not?

45:41.239 --> 45:43.480
You just blew up the Pope
County jail, the Sheriff

45:43.541 --> 45:45.521
and half the cowboys in town.

45:45.576 --> 45:47.283
To save you.

45:47.345 --> 45:48.722
Who said that?

45:48.946 --> 45:50.482
Ain't tellin’.

45:51.549 --> 45:53.995
Well, whoever or whatever you
are, a hearing's gonna be held

45:54.051 --> 45:55.928
and you've gotta answer some questions.

45:56.754 --> 45:58.097
For what?

45:58.155 --> 45:59.828
'Cause that's the law.

46:02.560 --> 46:04.267
Well, see you around, kid.

46:06.130 --> 46:07.666
Wait.

46:12.136 --> 46:13.672
God in heaven!

46:18.309 --> 46:20.220
Stringfellow Hawke.

46:21.078 --> 46:24.025
Shouldn't be too hard finding
a man with a name like that.

46:34.225 --> 46:36.762
She was kind of cute, huh, String?

46:37.094 --> 46:38.971
Cute? She's a kid.

46:39.263 --> 46:40.298
Oh?

46:40.398 --> 46:44.175
I didn't know the Texas Highway
Patrol let kids fly their choppers.

46:44.869 --> 46:46.507
But you know what they say.

46:47.538 --> 46:48.812
What?

46:48.873 --> 46:50.750
They always get their man.

46:52.910 --> 46:54.912
That's the Canadian Mounties.

46:55.313 --> 46:57.224
Same principle.

46:59.283 --> 47:01.422
There's a yellow rose in Texas

47:01.485 --> 47:03.362
That I am going to see

47:03.421 --> 47:05.196
Nobody else could miss her

47:05.256 --> 47:07.361
Not half as much as me

47:07.425 --> 47:11.271
Oh, she cried so when I left her

47:11.329 --> 47:13.309
It like to make me cry

47:13.364 --> 47:15.605
And if I ever find her

47:15.666 --> 47:20.479
We nevermore will part

47:21.305 --> 47:27.290
