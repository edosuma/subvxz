Hey, Jonah.

00:06.750 --> 00:08.210
Hey, Cyrus.

00:08.210 --> 00:10.000
Do you see that?
Jonah Beck sayin' hi to me?

00:10.000 --> 00:13.460
Like, wha'ever. No B.D.,
we're friends...

00:14.500 --> 00:17.460
Okay, look, not everything
has to be a competition.

00:17.460 --> 00:18.750
But can it be?

00:20.460 --> 00:21.620
You made the team?

-Yes!

00:26.040 --> 00:27.580

00:27.580 --> 00:29.710
Don't make her leave again.

00:29.710 --> 00:32.170
Again?
What did you tell her?

00:32.170 --> 00:33.290
Nothing, I swear.

00:34.290 --> 00:35.460
I-- Uh--

00:35.460 --> 00:37.960
I don't want her to think
I sent you away.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.500
Well, I know that's
not what you think.

00:40.500 --> 00:42.040
Because that's not
what happened.

00:42.040 --> 00:45.000
Mom, we've been
having this fight
for 13 years.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.420
I've resigned myself to the fact

00:46.420 --> 00:47.960
that we'll never agree
what happened.

00:47.960 --> 00:50.210
I'm the kid here.
You're the adults,

00:50.210 --> 00:51.880
it's your job
to figure this out.

01:01.000 --> 01:03.210
So, tell me the names
of the moves.

01:03.210 --> 01:05.040
I made up a little song.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.540

You don't have much confidence
in your puzzle skills.

01:43.330 --> 01:47.080

left over, we can work
on my fidget spinning skills.

-(laughs)
-(phone beeps)

01:49.540 --> 01:53.500
It's from CeCe.
She's doing a "closet cleanse"?

01:53.500 --> 01:56.080
What's the point?
It's just gonna get cluttered
in two weeks anyway.

we'd better come pick it up
today, otherwise

-I'm telling her yes.
-No, we're busy!

02:06.620 --> 02:08.250
It'll only take an hour.

02:08.250 --> 02:12.540
And then...
we can cleanse the fridge?

Why not?

-I need your room.
-Why?

02:22.580 --> 02:24.210
It has a door.

02:34.330 --> 02:36.580

Thirteen years ago,
when you were a baby...

02:44.500 --> 02:46.580

04:00.580 --> 04:03.540
for lying to me for 13 years,

04:03.540 --> 04:05.670
then you should be able

04:05.670 --> 04:08.040
for whatever happened
13 years ago.

She always does.

04:10.620 --> 04:12.750
We need Pops.
Where is he?

04:12.750 --> 04:14.080
He's at his Hot Yoga class.

04:14.080 --> 04:15.620
Dad's doing Hot Yoga?

04:15.620 --> 04:17.210
I did not know that.

04:17.210 --> 04:18.960
There's a lot you don't know
about us.

04:18.960 --> 04:20.540
Well, it's not like
opening up and sharing

04:20.540 --> 04:21.620

04:21.620 --> 04:22.580
Okay!

04:22.580 --> 04:24.170
Today's about forgiveness.

04:24.170 --> 04:25.460

04:49.710 --> 04:50.830
What's that?

04:50.830 --> 04:53.330
Hebrew.
I'm studying for my bar mitzvah.

04:53.330 --> 04:54.670
You shoulda gotten
the save-the-date.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.710
I did.
I'm savin' it.

04:56.710 --> 04:57.920
You can read that?

04:57.920 --> 05:00.330
How do you say
docious magocious
in Hebrew?

05:00.330 --> 05:01.710
Mm-- Ya don't.

05:01.710 --> 05:03.880
But I appreciate
your pretend interest.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.250
Dude, don't put yourself
down like that.

05:06.250 --> 05:08.880
You think this is me
putting myself down?

05:08.880 --> 05:12.000
You should see me when
I'm really putting myself down.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.830
Actually, you shouldn't.
It's dark.

05:14.830 --> 05:16.500
Well, there's something
I couldn't do.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.670
Read that.

05:17.670 --> 05:19.290
I'd much rather be able
to do that.

05:19.290 --> 05:20.620
You wanna skateboard?

05:20.620 --> 05:22.420
I can teach you right now.

05:22.420 --> 05:24.500
Ah-ha-ha, good one.

05:24.500 --> 05:27.040
Cyrus, it's easy.
You can do it.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.540
Really?

05:29.540 --> 05:31.210
Hold on.
Let me turn down
my mother's voice

05:31.210 --> 05:32.620
screaming "no" in my head.

Buffy:
I swear, I'm not
selling anything.

05:37.710 --> 05:40.120
It's for this class at school.

05:40.120 --> 05:43.040
Community service.
Our grades depend
on how many people

05:43.040 --> 05:44.250
we can sign up.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.380
Nice to know you care, Buffy.

05:46.380 --> 05:48.420
Millie, of course I care.

05:48.420 --> 05:50.620
You know I've always been
a really great neighbor.

05:50.620 --> 05:51.830
No, you haven't.

05:51.830 --> 05:55.880
Well, I'm being one now.

05:55.880 --> 05:59.620
How would you like
a hot meal delivered
to your door every day?

05:59.620 --> 06:01.080
Healthy food?

06:01.080 --> 06:04.460
-Lots of vegetables?
-Tons of vegetables.

06:04.460 --> 06:07.460
No, thanks.
You can sign me up

06:07.460 --> 06:10.790
when you find a food service
that delivers baby taters

06:10.790 --> 06:11.960
and milkshakes.

06:13.460 --> 06:15.040
That's my favorite meal, too.

06:15.040 --> 06:18.420
I like to dip my baby taters
in my milkshake.

06:18.420 --> 06:20.000
Me, too!

06:20.000 --> 06:23.080
Only two times in your life
you're allowed to eat
like that...

06:23.080 --> 06:25.080
your age and my age.

06:27.080 --> 06:30.670
Millie, I really wanna
sign you up for something.

06:30.670 --> 06:32.620
And not just
to get a good grade.

06:32.620 --> 06:33.710
Well, what do you got?

06:33.710 --> 06:35.710
-Social calls?
-What's that?

06:35.710 --> 06:38.750
Somebody comes by,
oh-- takes you for a walk?

06:38.750 --> 06:40.040
Like a dog?

06:40.040 --> 06:41.120
No.

06:41.120 --> 06:42.750
Well, how is it different?

06:44.290 --> 06:45.540
Pass.

06:47.750 --> 06:50.290
Oh, or we could just
sit and talk?

06:51.500 --> 06:52.920
Watch TV?

06:52.920 --> 06:55.500
Or maybe just play some games.

06:55.500 --> 06:58.170
-Card games?
-Of course card games.

07:00.960 --> 07:02.710
Right now?

07:02.710 --> 07:03.920
One game.

07:04.920 --> 07:07.830
Okay.
One game.

07:07.830 --> 07:09.620
Ever play Spite and Malice?

07:09.620 --> 07:10.670
No.

07:10.670 --> 07:12.830
Excellent.

07:17.330 --> 07:19.250
Bex:
My tank top collection!

07:19.250 --> 07:22.000
Look at all my tank tops!

07:22.000 --> 07:24.710
See how I fringed
the bottom of this one?

07:24.710 --> 07:28.040
Yeah, it looks like
your bra has a hula skirt.

07:28.040 --> 07:32.670
You joke, but I was
kind of a tank top celebrity.
It was how I layered them.

07:32.670 --> 07:35.710
And I wore these pants.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.500
Skull wallet with chain, natch.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.750
And, saving the best for last...

07:41.750 --> 07:43.420
dun-dun dahh!

07:43.420 --> 07:44.960
(laughs)

07:44.960 --> 07:47.920
I wasn't allowed to get these.

07:47.920 --> 07:49.460
I mean, you know
what that's like.

07:49.460 --> 07:51.750
Only you listened to her.
I never did.

07:51.750 --> 07:53.710
Never?

07:53.710 --> 07:56.750
It wasn't just what she said,
it was... how she said it.

07:56.750 --> 07:59.750
Like I was stupid,
and everything I did was wrong.

08:01.000 --> 08:02.710
But I looked cute.

08:02.710 --> 08:04.460
Do you wanna see
my signature outfit?

08:04.460 --> 08:05.920
Absolutely.

08:08.620 --> 08:12.420
So what actually happened?

08:12.420 --> 08:16.170
It's not coming out,
but it's just lipstick,
I think it's fine.

08:16.170 --> 08:17.670
It's not the end of the world.

08:17.670 --> 08:20.330
No, it's just the end
of Andi's clothes.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.460
She can wear them,
she won't care.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.290
Live like a farm animal
if you want.

08:24.290 --> 08:25.960
I won't let you
raise Andi that way.

08:25.960 --> 08:28.000
Um, she's my daughter.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.620
You can't take care of her!
You don't know how!

08:30.620 --> 08:32.080
Yes, I do!

08:32.080 --> 08:37.040
Look, it's not just
changing her diaper, Rebecca.

08:37.040 --> 08:39.170
What-- What if she
gets strep throat?

08:39.170 --> 08:42.830
An ear infection?
What if she puts something
in her mouth and starts choking?

08:42.830 --> 08:44.080
Do you know what to do?

08:46.540 --> 08:49.790
How can I trust her with you?
You can't even do her laundry.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.920
She was constantly
criticizing me,

08:54.920 --> 08:57.080
and telling me
everything I was doing
was wrong.

08:57.080 --> 09:00.960
I think you're exaggerating,
just a little bit.

09:00.960 --> 09:04.750
Aw, Bex.
I'm tryin' to clean up,
and you're makin' a mess.

09:05.750 --> 09:08.120
Thank you, Mom,
your timing was perfect.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.540
See?
What did I tell you?

09:09.540 --> 09:10.920
What did you tell her?

09:10.920 --> 09:12.210
Nothing.

09:12.210 --> 09:15.000
Please don't ruin
my relationship with Andi.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.330
I loved being her mother.

09:17.330 --> 09:19.540
Can't say the same
about me, though, can you?

09:19.540 --> 09:20.880
Feel free
to set the record straight, Mom,

09:20.880 --> 09:22.290
tell her
what a terrible child I was.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.670
Celia:
Bex wasn't a terrible child.

09:30.670 --> 09:32.250
I just get so frustrated

09:32.250 --> 09:34.880
when she clings
to her skewed memories.

09:34.880 --> 09:38.000
That's the main source
of our conflict.

09:38.000 --> 09:43.000
But...
I want you to know
what really happened.

10:08.500 --> 10:10.830
You had your chance
to raise a daughter
and you blew it.

10:10.830 --> 10:12.210
She's not your do-over!

10:12.210 --> 10:14.880
Rebecca, it doesn't
have to be like this.

10:18.210 --> 10:20.290
I'll leave a plate
for you in the fridge.

10:22.880 --> 10:26.000
I'm sure that's very different
from what she told you.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.830
Very different,
you could say that.

10:27.830 --> 10:30.380
You could also say
completely different.

10:30.380 --> 10:32.170
-Yeah.
-(knock on door)

10:32.170 --> 10:36.960
-Okay if I come in?
-Hey, Pops, how was Hot Yoga?

10:36.960 --> 10:39.670
I hate it.
It's the worst.

10:39.670 --> 10:41.120
-(Andi laughs)
-I bought a 10-class package.

10:41.120 --> 10:43.790
-Uh-huh.
-Oh, hey.
Do you know what today is?

10:43.790 --> 10:45.040
Uh-- Bex, get in here!

10:46.540 --> 10:49.670
Today is the first time
that we've all been together

10:49.670 --> 10:53.580
in this house, on this date,
in 13 years!

10:53.580 --> 10:56.000
Yay!
(laughs)

10:57.920 --> 10:59.880
Am I the only one
who's happy about this?

10:59.880 --> 11:02.080
I am, too! Yay!

11:02.080 --> 11:04.750
(laughs)

11:04.750 --> 11:06.000
Yay!

11:06.000 --> 11:08.080
Yay?

11:08.080 --> 11:09.120
Yay.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.290
Needs some work.

11:13.290 --> 11:15.210
We'll get there.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.000
You catch on quick.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.170
Thank you.

11:23.170 --> 11:25.920
But not quick enough.

11:28.040 --> 11:29.620
Read 'em and weep!

11:29.620 --> 11:32.790
Ugh!
I was so close that time!

11:32.790 --> 11:33.830
Ohh...

11:33.830 --> 11:34.880
Go again?

11:34.880 --> 11:36.000
I gotta win once.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.080
Not going to happen.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.500
You don't know me.

11:39.500 --> 11:41.210
You don't know me.

11:41.210 --> 11:44.620
I'm not leaving here
until I win.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.790
I've lost my friends,
I've lost my family,

11:47.790 --> 11:49.380
I've lost my teeth.

11:49.380 --> 11:52.620
But I have never
lost a game!

11:54.880 --> 11:56.790
Deal.

11:56.790 --> 12:01.380
I'm loving this!
I feel so free!

12:01.380 --> 12:05.540
This isn't skateboarding.
This is standing.
You have to move.

12:05.540 --> 12:08.830
Do I, though?
When I'm blessed
with a vivid imagination.

12:08.830 --> 12:10.880
You're one of a kind, Cyrus.

12:10.880 --> 12:13.170
I'm actually not.
I've met my doppelganger.

12:13.170 --> 12:15.120
Heh-- How's my form?

12:15.120 --> 12:18.920
Your form's great,
but your skateboarding
leaves something to be desired,

12:18.920 --> 12:20.330
but that's okay.

12:20.330 --> 12:22.880
I was hoping we'd be able
to go skateboarding together.

12:22.880 --> 12:26.380
You and me--? Whoa!
You and me?

12:26.380 --> 12:28.210
Skateboard buddies?

12:28.210 --> 12:29.750
I want that.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.620
That's great!
Now just kick it back
a few times.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.120
Cyrus, you're doin' it!

12:37.120 --> 12:38.420
I'm doin' it!

12:40.380 --> 12:42.080
Cyrus, slow down!

12:42.080 --> 12:43.080
I don't know how!

12:44.080 --> 12:45.380
Turn!

12:45.380 --> 12:46.420
I don't know how!

12:46.420 --> 12:48.380
-Stop!
-I don't know how!

12:49.380 --> 12:51.460
Ahh!

12:51.460 --> 12:52.580
Cyrus!

12:52.580 --> 12:53.960
Cyrus:
My arm!

12:53.960 --> 12:56.830
-(cry of pain)
-I need an ambulance.

12:58.120 --> 12:59.580
You two don't need
to keep fighting

12:59.580 --> 13:02.250
about whatever happened
back then.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.040
I turned out okay.

13:04.040 --> 13:05.380
(quietly)
Thanks to me.

13:05.380 --> 13:06.830
We all heard that.

13:06.830 --> 13:09.330
(sighs)
One thing I still
don't understand.

13:09.330 --> 13:11.380
I get why you left.

13:11.380 --> 13:14.080
But why that day?
Did something happen?

13:14.080 --> 13:16.120
Ham:
You didn't tell her?

13:16.120 --> 13:17.420
Tell me what?

13:17.420 --> 13:19.710
You wanna tell her?

13:19.710 --> 13:21.750
It's not my favorite story.

13:21.750 --> 13:24.620
-She should know.
-Know what?

13:24.620 --> 13:27.210
From now on,
when Andi has a check-up,
I'm taking her.

13:27.210 --> 13:28.920
Not you, just me!

13:28.920 --> 13:30.500
Ugh! You're overreacting!

13:30.500 --> 13:32.670
The pediatrician
doesn't even know
I'm her mother!

13:32.670 --> 13:34.290
Of course he does!

13:34.290 --> 13:36.620
He gave me a lollipop!

13:36.620 --> 13:38.920
For being brave when
Andi was getting her shots,

13:38.920 --> 13:40.460
which you weren't, by the way.

13:40.460 --> 13:43.920
-Knock, knock.
-What is it, Ham? We're
in the middle of something.

13:43.920 --> 13:46.790
I think you left something
in the hallway by the coat rack?

13:46.790 --> 13:47.790
(Celia gasps)

13:49.330 --> 13:51.620
She was still strapped
in the car seat.

13:51.620 --> 13:53.210
-Oh!
-Well, I thought I had her--

13:53.210 --> 13:55.170
-You had her last--
-You were supposed to
take her from me--

13:55.170 --> 13:57.120
-No, I-- I didn't--
-How long was she there?

13:57.120 --> 13:59.380
Since we got back
from the doctor.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.250
-That was 40 minutes ago.
-Ohh...

14:01.250 --> 14:02.750
Bex/Celia:
I'll take her.

14:02.750 --> 14:04.580
Andi:
Mama.

14:04.580 --> 14:07.790
Did you hear that?
Did she just say
her first word?

14:07.790 --> 14:11.120
Mama!
She said Mama!

14:11.120 --> 14:12.250
Bex:
Say it again.

14:14.040 --> 14:16.880
Mama. Mama.

14:18.380 --> 14:20.170
-Mama.
-(Celia gasps)

14:21.540 --> 14:23.830
-Mama.
-Aww...

14:23.830 --> 14:26.290
Andi, I'm sorry.

14:29.710 --> 14:32.330
(quietly)
Do you forgive us?
I'm so sorry...

14:32.330 --> 14:34.210
Bex...

14:34.210 --> 14:35.880
It's fine.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.670
I just need a minute...

14:40.580 --> 14:41.880
(door closing)

14:44.580 --> 14:46.420
I made you leave.

14:48.380 --> 14:49.960
It was me.

14:55.710 --> 15:01.250
I can't believe the first words
I ever said were the reason why
you left.

15:01.250 --> 15:06.790
It wasn't only that word,
it was all the other words
that had come before it.

15:06.790 --> 15:10.170
Hey... I didn't wanna leave.

15:10.170 --> 15:12.580
It was the last thing I wanted.

15:12.580 --> 15:16.250
But the first thing I wanted
was for you to be happy.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.080
And I don't think
you would've been...

15:18.080 --> 15:20.250
with the both of us here.

15:20.250 --> 15:23.790
I trusted you, because I knew
how much you loved her.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.420
That was an amazing sacrifice
you made.

15:27.580 --> 15:29.460
What?

15:29.460 --> 15:32.250
I don't think
I could've made it.

15:33.380 --> 15:38.380
Mom...
you've never said that before.

15:50.540 --> 15:52.420
Read 'em and weep!

15:52.420 --> 15:55.750
Ugh!
Do you have to say that
every time?

15:55.750 --> 15:57.080
Yes, I do!

15:57.080 --> 15:59.540
At least until you actually
start weeping.
(laughs)

15:59.540 --> 16:01.290
My deal.

16:02.620 --> 16:06.000
This isn't the only thing
in your life... is it?

16:08.420 --> 16:10.670
You really lost
all your family and friends?

16:10.670 --> 16:15.880
Yes, I did.
None of them
will play with me anymore.

16:15.880 --> 16:18.750
Wait-- They're still alive?

16:18.750 --> 16:22.210
-So what,
if they won't play cards?
-(laughs) Ugh!

16:22.210 --> 16:23.830
(phone beeps)

16:25.500 --> 16:27.500
My friend Cyrus
is in the hospital.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.040
Um, I gotta go.

16:29.040 --> 16:32.750
But you didn't win.
You said you wouldn't leave
until you did!

16:32.750 --> 16:34.460
Thank you so much, Millie.

16:36.210 --> 16:37.920
For what?

16:37.920 --> 16:40.500
For reminding me that
friends are more important
than winning.

16:42.460 --> 16:43.750
Who said that?

16:43.750 --> 16:45.120
I didn't.

16:45.120 --> 16:48.880
Millie:
Next time bring baby taters.
And milkshakes!

16:48.880 --> 16:50.290
And make mine chocolate!

16:53.620 --> 16:55.540
Oh, how is he?

16:55.540 --> 16:57.460
-I don't know.
-What happened?

16:57.460 --> 16:59.380
I was teaching him
to skateboard.

16:59.380 --> 17:00.580
-What?
-Are you insane?

17:00.580 --> 17:03.670
You were with him
when he threw up
on the merry-go-round.

17:03.670 --> 17:05.830
Sometimes I forget
how helpless he is.

17:05.830 --> 17:07.500
You do?

17:07.500 --> 17:10.080
It's his
defining characteristic.

17:11.460 --> 17:13.120
Oh, here he comes.

17:16.580 --> 17:19.960
Guys?
Check it out.
I'm in a sling!

17:19.960 --> 17:21.420
Did you break your arm?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.540
Part of it!

17:27.210 --> 17:29.080
You had me so scared, dude.

17:29.080 --> 17:31.080
I'm so glad
nothing happened to you.

17:31.080 --> 17:32.540
Nothing?

17:32.540 --> 17:34.210
This is a milestone.

17:34.210 --> 17:38.460
My whole life I have lived
under a cloud of fear.

17:38.460 --> 17:41.460
"Don't climb to the top."
"Don't swim after you've eaten."

17:41.460 --> 17:45.120
"You could get lost
and die in a corn maze."

17:45.120 --> 17:50.500
But today, I was reckless.
I stood on the edge and looked
into the abyss.

17:50.500 --> 17:52.380
And here's the proof.

17:52.380 --> 17:54.290
And I want you all to sign it.

17:57.540 --> 17:59.620
Smaller.
Just your first name.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.880
(laughs)

18:00.880 --> 18:02.290
Leave some room.

18:04.960 --> 18:06.670
Hey, Mom.
I'm done.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.710
Oh.
What did you decide to keep?

18:08.710 --> 18:11.420
Not much.
A few tank tops.

18:11.420 --> 18:12.420
And these...

18:12.420 --> 18:14.460
because they're outstanding.

18:14.460 --> 18:15.920
And the rest of it?

18:15.920 --> 18:18.580
It just--
It feels like it belongs
to a different person.

18:18.580 --> 18:20.170
Anyway, I don't have the room.

18:20.170 --> 18:21.670
I gotta start saving
Andi's stuff,

18:21.670 --> 18:23.880
so she can throw it out
when she grows up.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.420
I have a confession.

18:26.420 --> 18:28.460
You knew what today was.

18:29.540 --> 18:30.790
Why did you deny it?

18:30.790 --> 18:32.880
That's what I do.
It's a reflex.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.460
So when you invited us over--

18:34.460 --> 18:38.500
It's like this place
was haunted for one day
every year.

18:38.500 --> 18:41.580
And I thought
if you were here,
it would break the spell.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.420
I think it did.

18:44.500 --> 18:46.290
Me too.

18:46.290 --> 18:50.380
And this whole
"come get your stuff" routine
was a ruse, I knew it.

18:50.380 --> 18:51.790
I knew you'd never
throw it away.

18:51.790 --> 18:53.420
Oh, no, no, no, that was real.

18:53.420 --> 18:55.210
We gotta get this place
in shape.

18:55.210 --> 18:56.250
We're selling it.

18:56.250 --> 18:57.380
Selling what?

18:57.380 --> 18:58.830
The house.

18:58.830 --> 19:00.830
You're selling the house?

19:00.830 --> 19:03.120
You can't do that,
why would you do that?

19:03.120 --> 19:05.290
It's just too big
for your dad and me.

19:05.290 --> 19:08.000
But... it's our house!

19:08.000 --> 19:09.880
You don't live here anymore.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.330
What about AndiShack?
What happens to AndiShack?

19:12.330 --> 19:14.000
We gotta clean that up, too.

19:14.000 --> 19:17.580
Mom!
Andi's gonna be devastated!

19:17.580 --> 19:20.960
I agree.
That's why you should be
prepared when you tell her.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.420
Me?
Why do I have to tell her?

19:23.420 --> 19:25.540
Because you do
all the big jobs now.

19:25.540 --> 19:26.500
You're the mama.

19:28.460 --> 19:29.710

19:50.330 --> 19:51.710
Long day, huh?

19:51.710 --> 19:54.330
Too long.
All I wanna do right now
is make a tent

19:54.330 --> 19:56.290
out of my blanket
and eat animal crackers.

19:56.290 --> 19:59.000
Oh, before that,
there's something
I have to tell you.

20:00.080 --> 20:01.170
What?

20:05.170 --> 20:07.210
We also have vanilla wafers.

20:07.210 --> 20:09.000
Ooh! Yay!

20:10.670 --> 20:12.620
Have fun.

20:12.620 --> 20:15.000
I'll just be here
singing to my cube.

Andi:
Next, on Andi Mack...

20:32.880 --> 20:34.580
(cheering)

20:37.210 --> 20:39.210
Woops.

20:39.210 --> 20:40.290
Seriously?

20:40.290 --> 20:42.580
I think I just invited Amber
to sleep over.

20:42.580 --> 20:44.210
You're a good person,
Andi Mack.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.500
You're also dumb.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.750
Buffy: She is a snake.
And she's a scorpion.

20:47.750 --> 20:49.920
She's a snorpion.

20:49.920 --> 20:52.080
This is awesome!

20:52.080 --> 20:53.920
(sirens wailing)

20:53.920 --> 20:55.000
Should I go to my room

20:55.000 --> 20:56.080
and think about what I've done?

20:56.080 --> 20:58.250
Fine. It seems so unoriginal.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.670
(drumbeats, bonk, thud)
