WEBVTT

00:04.874 --> 00:08.008
Hey, the flip-house looks great.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.313
Are you cleaning?

00:09.357 --> 00:12.099
No, I'm robbing the place.
Yes, I'm cleaning.

00:12.142 --> 00:14.840
Andi starts work with us
tomorrow,

00:14.884 --> 00:16.799
and you know what I realized
at 2:00 this morning?

00:16.842 --> 00:18.453
I didn't think this through.

00:18.496 --> 00:20.324
Well, I don't think
anything through

00:20.368 --> 00:21.847
and I sleep like a baby.

00:23.197 --> 00:25.025
She's gonna be here
all the time.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.636
So I came up with a solution,
I'm wife-proofing.

00:27.679 --> 00:32.249
Oh, it's like baby-proofing,
but so you don't end up crying.

00:32.293 --> 00:35.644
Exactly. Hey, like,
look at our fridge, huh?

00:35.687 --> 00:37.341
It's full of work beers.

00:37.385 --> 00:41.128
Wives don't understand
the concept of work beers.

00:41.171 --> 00:43.695
At NASA, they had an open bar
in mission control

00:43.739 --> 00:45.871
and they still landed
on the moon.

00:45.915 --> 00:48.004
I don't think they had that.

00:48.048 --> 00:51.268
I know space history,
that's my area, okay?

00:51.312 --> 00:53.314
Oh.

00:53.357 --> 00:56.317
I've got to get rid of these
Sausage McMuffin wrappers.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.145
Andi sees me have breakfast
at home,

00:58.188 --> 01:01.496
she doesn't need to know
I have second breakfast here.

01:01.539 --> 01:05.587
Andi won't be mad; it's a second
breakfast, not a second wife.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.545
No, she won't get mad,
but she will want

01:07.589 --> 01:09.112
to have a conversation about it.

01:09.156 --> 01:10.548
"Why do you need
a second breakfast?"

01:10.592 --> 01:12.115
"Are you swallowing feelings?"

01:12.159 --> 01:14.030
The problem is,

01:14.074 --> 01:15.945
wives want to dive into stuff.

01:15.988 --> 01:18.121
But there's no deep end
in the man pool.

01:18.165 --> 01:20.645
It's three feet
all the way across.

01:20.689 --> 01:24.084
We keep it simple, and
we get stuff done, huh?

01:24.127 --> 01:25.911
Oh, which reminds me.

01:25.955 --> 01:28.914
What do we do if Andi's here
and we get done with work early?

01:28.958 --> 01:32.135
The usual: We hit the batting
cages, eat some hotdogs.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.311
Second lunch,
you taught me that.

01:34.355 --> 01:37.227
No, no, because then Andi
will wonder

01:37.271 --> 01:39.011
why do I want to hang out
with the guys?

01:39.055 --> 01:40.578
Why don't I want to be home?

01:40.622 --> 01:42.058
So from now on,

01:42.102 --> 01:43.799
if we finish work early, we say,

01:43.842 --> 01:47.803
"Wow, we finished work early
for the first time ever.

01:47.846 --> 01:51.546
Let's rush right home
and be with our families." Hmm?

01:51.589 --> 01:53.374
That doesn't sound like us.

01:54.897 --> 01:56.899
We're gonna have to
call the hotdog guy

01:56.942 --> 01:58.683
and let him know
we're okay.

01:58.727 --> 02:02.209
Also, Don, I have terrible news.

02:02.252 --> 02:04.211
You have to take down
your tool girl calendar.

02:04.254 --> 02:07.344
No. Not Donny's Angels.

02:07.388 --> 02:09.694
I'll just put Post-its over
their naughty bits,

02:09.738 --> 02:11.870
and then we can lift them up
like little skirts.

02:11.914 --> 02:14.830
If you don't take it down,
Andi's gonna have questions.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.571
"Why do you feel the need
to look at other women?"

02:16.614 --> 02:18.486
"Is Marcy not enough for you?"

02:18.529 --> 02:22.229
I love Marcy. When she makes
a calendar, I'll buy that.

02:22.272 --> 02:24.056
Take it down.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.754
And don't put it in your desk;
you'll spend all day

02:25.797 --> 02:27.103
with your head in the drawer.

02:29.932 --> 02:33.762
Hey, Dad, thanks for taking
the kids to school.My pleasure.

02:33.805 --> 02:35.546
It's your first day working
with your wife,

02:35.590 --> 02:38.549
so I wanted to be here to say
"nice knowing you."

02:38.593 --> 02:40.769
I think I'll be all right.

02:40.812 --> 02:43.206
You're gonna be together
all day, every day.

02:43.250 --> 02:45.774
She's gonna get
a real long look at you.

02:45.817 --> 02:48.385
And the more they look,
the more they see.

02:48.429 --> 02:50.257
Who're you talking to, huh?

02:50.300 --> 02:52.084
I already wife-proofed
the trailer.

02:52.128 --> 02:54.435
I hid stuff like a good husband.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.959
Good morning, fellas.

02:57.002 --> 02:58.395
This is it, honey.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.963
You and me working together.

03:01.006 --> 03:02.921
Hey, can we hold hands
at the office? Probably not.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.750
I won't. I might. I don't know.
Aren't you excited?

03:05.794 --> 03:08.579
Of course I am. Yeah.
I'm so excited,

03:08.623 --> 03:11.843
I am gonna hold your hand right
now, what do you think of that?

03:11.887 --> 03:13.671
I like it.

03:13.715 --> 03:16.108
Working together's
already so fun.

03:16.152 --> 03:17.501
Give it time.

03:19.068 --> 03:20.287
Hey, guys,
we made you something.

03:20.330 --> 03:21.984
Wh...?

03:22.027 --> 03:24.595
Mom and Dad
lunch boxes. Cool.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.597
You guys are so sweet.

03:26.641 --> 03:27.859
Well, we just think
it's great you guys

03:27.903 --> 03:29.296
are starting this
new chapter together.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.036
It's going to be wonderful.

03:32.734 --> 03:35.215
Well, we love you guys.
Have a great day at school.

03:35.258 --> 03:38.435
I bet their day won't be
as great as ours.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.132
Uh, definitely not.

03:40.176 --> 03:41.830
You guys are adorable.

03:41.873 --> 03:44.136
Have fun.

03:44.180 --> 03:47.139
20 bucks says
they won't make it a week.

03:47.183 --> 03:48.663
I'll take that action.

04:02.677 --> 04:04.418
Here she is.

04:04.461 --> 04:05.897
Can we get a warm welcome

04:05.941 --> 04:09.597
for our new interior decorator,
Andi Burns?

04:09.640 --> 04:10.815
I mean it, clap.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.689
Thank you, thank you.

04:14.732 --> 04:17.082
Don't get me used to that or
you'll have to do it every day.

04:18.823 --> 04:22.087
Man, it's clean in here.

04:22.131 --> 04:23.263
Is it?

04:24.612 --> 04:26.744
Hey, where is Don's
nudie calendar?

04:26.788 --> 04:30.400
Oh. Oh, I took that down
because I got tired

04:30.444 --> 04:32.576
of looking at half-naked ladies.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.404
You got to grow up sometime.

04:34.448 --> 04:37.625
We're so proud of him.Uh-uh.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.323
Did you change things for me?

04:40.367 --> 04:42.717
I mean, did you,
like, wife-proof?

04:42.760 --> 04:44.371
Wife-proof?

04:44.414 --> 04:45.894
What's that?

04:45.937 --> 04:48.766
You can't just
make up words.

04:48.810 --> 04:52.422
Listen, honey, don't think
of me as your wife here, okay?

04:52.466 --> 04:53.902
Nothing has to change.

04:53.945 --> 04:56.687
I am just one of the guys.

04:56.731 --> 04:59.037
Well, since you're one of
the guys, I should tell you

04:59.081 --> 05:02.606
that somebody's wife is
coming in today, so be cool.

05:02.650 --> 05:05.305
I'm serious, I can hang.

05:05.348 --> 05:07.350
Then great. I'm gonna put
my calendar back up.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.960
I didn't grow out of it at all.

05:09.004 --> 05:11.833
If anything, the older I get,
the more I need it.

05:11.876 --> 05:14.488
Although,
it does make me wonder,

05:14.531 --> 05:17.447
why do you feel the need
to look at those girls?

05:17.491 --> 05:18.709
There it is.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.885
You can't say "wife"
without "why."

05:20.929 --> 05:24.585
Hey, Donny's Angels
are Donny's business.

05:24.628 --> 05:27.849
Maybe Adam was right to be
worried about you working here.

05:27.892 --> 05:29.938
He said he was worried?

05:29.981 --> 05:31.156
You told me you were excited.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.202
I-I am excited.

05:33.245 --> 05:35.596
Let's hear it again
for Andi Burns.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.687
So you told them you were
worried about working with me.

05:39.730 --> 05:42.254
To be honest, when
I hear you say it,

05:42.298 --> 05:44.648
it doesn't sound
like something I'd say.

05:44.692 --> 05:46.868
Right, guys?
Back me up here.

05:46.911 --> 05:48.870
Wow, we finished early
for the first time ever.

05:48.913 --> 05:50.611
Let's rush right home
to be with our families.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.704
Okay, fine.

05:56.747 --> 05:59.663
If I was worried about
anything, it's that...

05:59.707 --> 06:01.535
it's that you like
to dig into things

06:01.578 --> 06:03.798
and talk about
people's feelings.

06:03.841 --> 06:06.888
Why this? Why that?
Why? Why? Why?

06:06.931 --> 06:09.020
Why does that bother you
so much?

06:09.064 --> 06:10.631
At home it's great,

06:10.674 --> 06:12.633
it's tolerable,
it's great.

06:12.676 --> 06:16.419
But in this office, we like to
keep things nice and shallow.

06:16.463 --> 06:18.552
Okay? Otherwise, you open
up a whole can of worms

06:18.595 --> 06:20.249
and we don't get any work done.

06:20.292 --> 06:23.208
And believe me, those two guys
have got a lot of worms.

06:23.252 --> 06:25.863
Well, I don't want to get
in the way of work.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.258
Okay, I can be shallow.

06:29.301 --> 06:30.390
That's my girl.

06:30.433 --> 06:31.826
Yeah.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.610
Put Don's nudie calendar back up

06:33.654 --> 06:36.047
and I won't ask why he likes it.

06:36.091 --> 06:38.659
Even though it's a clear
indication of deeper problems.

06:38.702 --> 06:40.748
Great. I-It's in
Lowell's drawer.

06:45.492 --> 06:47.058
Oh, my God.

06:47.102 --> 06:48.886
Yeah, I-I know.
That calendar's a little much.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.453
We'll skip December.

06:50.497 --> 06:52.760
Mrs. Claus does not hold
a wrench like that.

06:52.803 --> 06:55.806
No, no. Look at this.

06:55.850 --> 06:59.288
It's a lease for an apartment
Lowell rented a month ago.

06:59.331 --> 07:00.985
Why would he
rent an apartment?

07:01.029 --> 07:04.902
I don't know.He has a house with
a wife and kids.

07:04.946 --> 07:07.035
Do you think
he and Jen split up?

07:07.078 --> 07:09.341
How's his mood?
Does he seem okay?

07:09.385 --> 07:11.909
H-- These are not
shallow questions, honey.

07:11.953 --> 07:13.433
Okay? Around here,
we like to stick

07:13.476 --> 07:16.697
to stuff like,
"What kind of sauce is that?"

07:16.740 --> 07:19.482
Sorry, you're right, I agreed.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.049
Thank you. All right.

07:21.092 --> 07:23.443
Now, let's get
to work, huh?

07:25.967 --> 07:28.230
Okay, that thing
I just agreed to?

07:28.273 --> 07:29.753
I don't want to
do that anymore.

07:29.797 --> 07:31.189
Um, you have
to talk to Lowell.

07:31.233 --> 07:33.061
But it's none
of our business.

07:33.104 --> 07:35.542
Okay? If he wanted to talk about
it, he would've talked about it.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.892
Well, maybe he doesn't feel
comfortable talking about it

07:37.935 --> 07:40.416
because you don't make him feel
comfortable talking about it.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.070
You know what you're
doing right now?

07:42.113 --> 07:43.593
You're opening up
a can of worms.

07:43.637 --> 07:45.377
And you know what worms catch?

07:45.421 --> 07:47.858
The fish of truth.

07:47.902 --> 07:50.513
Look how happy you are
with yourself, huh?

07:50.557 --> 07:52.602
It's like your face thinks
what you said makes sense.

07:54.125 --> 07:56.606
I'm sorry, Adam, you have
to talk to Lowell.

07:56.650 --> 07:57.607
There's no other choice.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.087
There's lots of other choices.

07:59.130 --> 08:01.393
Like ignoring it.
I choose that choice.

08:03.047 --> 08:05.180
I told you there'd be trouble
on day one.

08:05.223 --> 08:07.748
Pay up, shorties.

08:07.791 --> 08:09.010
Will you take
a mini Snickers?

08:09.053 --> 08:11.534
Damn right I will.

08:11.578 --> 08:13.362
Lowell rented an apartment.

08:13.405 --> 08:14.537
That's the kind
of thing people do

08:14.581 --> 08:15.843
when their marriage
is breaking up.

08:15.886 --> 08:17.366
So go check on your friend.

08:17.409 --> 08:20.630
You know we got no
work done today, right?

08:22.240 --> 08:24.416
This is why I was reluctant

08:24.460 --> 08:26.027
for you to come to the office.

08:26.070 --> 08:28.333
Oh, so now it's reluctant.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.553
It's gone from worried
to reluctant.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.338
Stop listening to my
words and let me talk.

08:33.382 --> 08:35.079
Hmm?

08:35.123 --> 08:38.343
Okay, well, if you want
to talk, go talk to Lowell.

08:38.387 --> 08:40.476
Share your feelings with him
and then report back to me.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.565
I don't want to do that.
I work with him.

08:42.609 --> 08:45.046
That's right, he's part
of your work family.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.004
That is a phrase
that a wife made up,

08:47.048 --> 08:48.528
That's not a real thing.

08:48.571 --> 08:50.834
Okay,
but aren't you curious

08:50.878 --> 08:52.096
why he rented an apartment?

08:52.140 --> 08:54.534
No, I am never curious why.

08:54.577 --> 08:57.711
When the NASA guys were boozing
it up in mission control

08:57.754 --> 09:01.323
and someone said let's go to
the moon, nobody asked why.

09:02.759 --> 09:04.718
Okay, you don't have
to talk to Lowell.

09:04.761 --> 09:06.633
Oh.

09:06.676 --> 09:10.114
We can just sit here and talk
about why you don't want to.

09:10.158 --> 09:13.291
Oh. I'll go.

09:13.335 --> 09:14.728
Oh.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.512
Another piece
of space history for you.

09:16.556 --> 09:18.122
The reason those guys wanted
to go to the moon

09:18.166 --> 09:19.428
is they were all married.

09:24.999 --> 09:27.044
I don't get it. Why do I have
to come to Lowell's apartment?

09:27.088 --> 09:30.308
Nobody gets to ask
me why anymore.

09:30.352 --> 09:34.269
You're so tense, maybe you need
an apple juice or something.

09:34.312 --> 09:36.663
I brought you with me
just in case Andi's right

09:36.706 --> 09:38.490
and Lowell's all emotional.

09:38.534 --> 09:42.016
You're like a funny thing
for him to look at.

09:42.059 --> 09:43.321
This is it.

09:43.365 --> 09:44.627
All right, let's do this.

09:44.671 --> 09:46.586
You and me together, brother.

09:49.197 --> 09:51.721
Adam. How'd you find me?

09:51.765 --> 09:54.158
We came to make sure
you were all right.

09:54.202 --> 09:56.030
Who's we?
Me and...

09:56.073 --> 09:58.598
What?

09:58.641 --> 10:01.513
I'll be in the car.
You got this.

10:03.690 --> 10:06.127
Andi found the lease to this
place and thinks maybe

10:06.170 --> 10:08.216
you and Jen split
up or something.

10:08.259 --> 10:10.305
Oh. Well, everything's great.

10:10.348 --> 10:12.655
I knew it.
Of course it is.

10:12.699 --> 10:16.790
Jen and I are just exploring the
adventure of marital separation.

10:18.530 --> 10:19.967
You did split up.

10:20.010 --> 10:21.533
W-Why didn't
you say anything?

10:21.577 --> 10:22.970
It's only temporary.

10:23.013 --> 10:24.972
More of a housing glitch
than anything.

10:25.015 --> 10:28.715
The glitch being she chases me
away when I go near our house.

10:30.412 --> 10:33.328
Okay. Uh, that
sounds like something

10:33.371 --> 10:35.417
you might want to
share feelings about.

10:37.419 --> 10:40.074
I'm ready. Do it.
Just do it.

10:40.117 --> 10:41.728
I don't want
to talk about it.

10:41.771 --> 10:43.468
There are no feelings here.

10:43.512 --> 10:44.992
That's good. Great.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.558
Keep it inside
like a man.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.735
Hey, you got any beer?

10:48.778 --> 10:50.258
We can celebrate
your independence.

10:50.301 --> 10:52.477
I only have light beer.Perfect!

10:52.521 --> 10:55.567
Light beer, because
we keep it light, huh?

10:56.568 --> 10:58.614
Oh.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.707
This is where
you're staying?

11:04.751 --> 11:06.230
It's cozy.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.798
I eat there,

11:08.842 --> 11:10.452
I sit there,

11:10.495 --> 11:12.280
sometimes, I walk
over there,

11:12.323 --> 11:13.673
but then I come
back over here,

11:13.716 --> 11:15.849
because this is where
the party happens.

11:17.720 --> 11:20.505
You don't even have a TV.

11:20.549 --> 11:23.291
A TV, Lowell!

11:23.334 --> 11:24.945
I don't mind.
I just tape my phone

11:24.988 --> 11:26.468
to the wall and watch that.

11:26.511 --> 11:29.340
Okay. I guess that's something.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.647
Wait.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.301
Where's the bed?

11:33.344 --> 11:35.651
I grabbed my daughter's
sleeping bag on the way out.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.697
But it's three feet long.

11:37.740 --> 11:41.657
That's okay. These days,
I sleep in the fetal position.

11:43.528 --> 11:45.617
You said
there wouldn't be feelings.

11:45.661 --> 11:48.185
That gives me a big feeling,
Lowell!

11:48.229 --> 11:50.666
I'm sorry. Do you want to

11:50.710 --> 11:53.321
walk over there for a second
and come back over here?

11:53.364 --> 11:54.844
It helps me.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.064
All right, get your stuff.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.282
You're coming with me.

11:58.326 --> 11:59.980
Really?
Well, I can't
leave you here.

12:00.023 --> 12:02.112
You have no TV.
You'll die!

12:13.254 --> 12:14.516
So Lowell's staying with us?

12:14.559 --> 12:16.605
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

12:16.648 --> 12:19.129
Are you happy now?

12:19.173 --> 12:21.871
I am happy. I think it's a
good thing I went to work today.

12:21.915 --> 12:26.789
When I ask, "Are you happy
now?", it means I'm not happy.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.139
Okay, well, after we help
Lowell, we'll help you.

12:29.183 --> 12:31.011
Oh.
Pantry!

12:36.016 --> 12:39.236
Don't... don't you see
what you did?

12:39.280 --> 12:42.544
If I don't know about stuff,
I don't have to fix it.

12:42.587 --> 12:44.807
That's why I turn off
the UNICEF commercial

12:44.851 --> 12:46.853
before they show the kids.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.856
Otherwise, it's too sad,
and I end up buying 'em a goat.

12:49.899 --> 12:51.292
You know how many goats

12:51.335 --> 12:53.860
are running around
villages named Adam?

12:53.903 --> 12:55.339
They-they don't
name the goats after...

12:55.383 --> 12:58.168
Yes, they do.
Yes, they do.

12:58.212 --> 13:00.475
You put me in this position!

13:00.518 --> 13:02.651
Oh. So you're mad

13:02.694 --> 13:04.696
because I think
you're a good person?

13:04.740 --> 13:06.524
I don't love it.

13:06.568 --> 13:09.484
And now, thanks to you, I got
a giant sad kid on my couch,

13:09.527 --> 13:10.964
and I got to fix it.

13:11.007 --> 13:13.618
Because you're a sweet
and sensitive man.

13:13.662 --> 13:16.491
That's a low blow, Andi.

13:19.233 --> 13:21.496
Why didn't you tell us
you and Jen split up?

13:21.539 --> 13:23.019
Because it's
just temporary.

13:23.063 --> 13:24.716
Yeah, Lowell
explained to us

13:24.760 --> 13:26.327
that he's giving
Jen some space

13:26.370 --> 13:28.546
while she
temporarily sleeps

13:28.590 --> 13:30.679
with her horse-riding
instructor.

13:30.722 --> 13:35.858
Yeah, the whole car ride home
was one long UNICEF commercial.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.860
I have a question.

13:37.904 --> 13:39.862
She's with a horse guy, right?

13:39.906 --> 13:41.733
It makes me wonder.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.735
Do you think
"roll in the hay" comes

13:43.779 --> 13:45.346
from doing it
in the hayloft?

13:47.522 --> 13:50.003
Maybe let's save the
questions for the end.

13:50.046 --> 13:52.005
Guys, I'm fine.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.876
I'm sure we'll be
back together soon.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.836
I-I have another question.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.098
No, no, no. No.

13:59.403 --> 14:01.362
It's a real one.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.407
If she did this to you,

14:03.451 --> 14:05.845
why do you want her back?

14:05.888 --> 14:08.282
Every so often,
he surprises you.

14:10.719 --> 14:13.504
Like a whale surfacing
next to your kayak.

14:14.723 --> 14:16.638
Startling,
but beautiful.

14:16.681 --> 14:18.074
Yeah.

14:18.118 --> 14:21.077
I want her back
because she's my...

14:21.121 --> 14:23.471
We've been...

14:24.820 --> 14:26.822
Why doI want her back?

14:27.954 --> 14:29.433
I was a great husband

14:29.477 --> 14:31.348
and she wasn't that good a wife.

14:31.392 --> 14:33.133
This is a little thing,

14:33.176 --> 14:35.918
but she never once replaced
an empty toilet paper roll.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.833
I think she did it
just to make me duck-walk

14:37.877 --> 14:40.488
around the house
with my pants around my ankles.

14:40.531 --> 14:42.882
Ah, yes, the march
of the penguins.

14:44.274 --> 14:46.233
I deserve better!

14:46.276 --> 14:48.931
You know what?
You really do.

14:48.975 --> 14:49.976
And you're on
my team now,

14:50.019 --> 14:52.152
and no one screws
with my team.

14:52.195 --> 14:53.588
I want to do something.

14:53.631 --> 14:55.198
I just...
I don't know what.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.983
I'll tell you
what you're gonna do.

14:57.026 --> 15:00.595
Look at him. He's gonna
buy that kid a goat.

15:00.638 --> 15:04.077
You and the team are gonna
go over to your house,

15:04.120 --> 15:07.210
get all your stuff and let
Jen know that you are moving on.

15:07.254 --> 15:08.559
Yes!
Right?

15:08.603 --> 15:10.257
No.
Why?

15:10.300 --> 15:11.998
We can't. Her and the girls
are at her parents',

15:12.041 --> 15:13.913
and she changed the locks
on our house.

15:13.956 --> 15:17.046
What? She changed the locks
on you after what shedid? Oh.

15:17.090 --> 15:20.267
I really want to slap this girl
right in the sweet potatoes.

15:20.310 --> 15:22.617
Oh.

15:22.660 --> 15:24.706
So we'll just break in.
Then when she gets back

15:24.749 --> 15:26.316
and sees that all
your stuff is gone,

15:26.360 --> 15:27.970
she'll be in for
a big surprise.

15:28.014 --> 15:30.233
Yeah, a meansurprise.: Yeah.

15:30.277 --> 15:33.933
Like I got the day I came to
pick her up early at the barn.

15:33.976 --> 15:36.152
Let's not look back.
Let's look forward.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.328
I bet she was looking
back, though, right?

15:40.896 --> 15:44.160
What? I've been good this
whole time. I don't get one?

15:53.909 --> 15:55.955
Shh!

16:04.659 --> 16:06.052
ANDI: Oh. Okay.
Let go. Let go!

16:06.095 --> 16:08.097
Ooh.

16:12.101 --> 16:14.451
This is like when Dad tried to
save money on the pony ride.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.105
Just go.
No, yougo ahead.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.542
Okay, I'm taking you
with me.
What? What?

16:23.069 --> 16:24.592
What are you doing?

16:24.635 --> 16:26.463
Hiding the remote
under the cushion.

16:26.507 --> 16:28.117
Try and change the
channel now, Jen.

16:28.161 --> 16:31.425
You'll have to walk to
the TV like a sucker.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.079
Okay, let's just get Lowell's
stuff and get out of here.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.646
Relax. Nobody saw us break in.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.474
We were sneaky, like ninjas.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.695
WOMAN:
Shady Side Security.

16:40.738 --> 16:42.044
ADAM:
Shh.

16:42.088 --> 16:43.698
They don't know
we're in here.

16:43.741 --> 16:45.439
WOMAN:
I know you're in there.

16:45.482 --> 16:48.181
One of you is wearing
light-up shoes.

16:48.224 --> 16:51.184
I told you not
to wear those stupid shoes.

16:53.838 --> 16:56.145
Marcy and I are going
power-walking after this.

16:56.189 --> 16:58.147
Safety first, guys.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.803
Wait. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

17:01.846 --> 17:04.066
What are you gonna say?Don't worry. I got this.

17:06.286 --> 17:08.244
Thank God you're here.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.899
These violent criminals
broke into my house.

17:10.942 --> 17:13.554
Look, Mr. Franklin,
your wife told the office

17:13.597 --> 17:17.558
you two separated and to keep an
eye out for you, so, let's go.

17:17.601 --> 17:20.126
Wait a minute.
Where's the other guy?

17:22.867 --> 17:25.087
What other guy?

17:25.131 --> 17:27.829
They don't pay me enough
to care. Come on.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.918
If I ever

17:29.961 --> 17:32.660
become a criminal, this is the
first neighborhood I'm hitting.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.706
ANDI:
I can't believe

17:35.750 --> 17:37.143
Adam ditched us.

17:37.186 --> 17:39.493
I thought if anybody'd
run away, it'd be you.

17:39.536 --> 17:41.669
Well, I wouldn't
have gotten very far.

17:41.712 --> 17:44.106
The faster I move,
the brighter my shoes blink.

17:45.629 --> 17:47.414
Why did I hide the remote?

17:47.457 --> 17:49.111
I should've taken it!

17:49.155 --> 17:50.547
Everyone loves
finding the remote.

17:50.591 --> 17:52.419
Now she's gonna find it
and be happy.

17:52.462 --> 17:54.595
That's not payback!

17:54.638 --> 17:56.466
Where have you been?

17:56.510 --> 17:58.033
Well,

17:58.077 --> 17:59.643
while you jokers
were getting caught,

17:59.687 --> 18:01.950
I hid in the closet
like a ninja.

18:04.431 --> 18:07.912
You can't just say normal things
and then add "like a ninja."

18:07.956 --> 18:10.524
I ate a meatball sandwich...
like a ninja.

18:10.567 --> 18:13.048
Don't step on my moment, Andi.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.702
I'm getting to something good.

18:15.616 --> 18:18.009
Okay, now,
I didn't get your clothes,

18:18.053 --> 18:20.577
because, well, honestly,
I couldn't tell the difference

18:20.621 --> 18:22.144
between yours and Jen's.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.800
But I did find a way

18:25.843 --> 18:28.019
to make her very unhappy.

18:28.063 --> 18:30.196
This is my gift to you.

18:37.290 --> 18:39.857
Her toilet paper?

18:39.901 --> 18:42.947
He took her toilet paper!
That's so imaginative.

18:42.991 --> 18:46.516
Huh? Every roll in the house.

18:46.560 --> 18:49.171
Who's gonna be doing
the march of the penguins now?

18:50.477 --> 18:52.479
Oh, that is good.
Yeah.

18:52.522 --> 18:55.177
Plus, it saves me a run
to Costco.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.005
Yeah. Yeah. And now,

18:57.048 --> 18:58.702
there's no one there
to replace it.

18:58.746 --> 19:01.183
She is gonna regret
the day she let you go.

19:01.227 --> 19:03.533
Every time she has to go.Yeah.

19:03.577 --> 19:05.405
Mm-hmm.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.798
Now thatis payback.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.539
Enjoy the duck walk.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.802
Quack quack, Jen.

19:12.934 --> 19:14.544
Thank you for this.

19:14.588 --> 19:16.242
You're welcome.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.291
You hug like a ninja.

19:24.119 --> 19:26.339
Thank you, Lowell.

19:32.562 --> 19:34.521
Okay, Lowell is out cold.

19:34.564 --> 19:36.740
He really does sleep
in the fetal position.

19:38.394 --> 19:39.917
I tried to straighten him out,

19:39.961 --> 19:42.224
and he just snapped right back,
like a curly hair.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.576
Sorry we didn't get
much work done today.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.622
Eh, we've done less.

19:48.665 --> 19:51.277
Well, I-I'm serious.

19:51.320 --> 19:53.670
I don't want me being
at work to stress you out.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.368
I mean, in one day, you went

19:55.411 --> 19:57.500
from excited to
worried to reluctant.

19:57.544 --> 19:59.633
Honey, that's just
the three stages

19:59.676 --> 20:01.243
of working-with-your-wife grief.

20:01.287 --> 20:04.855
Okay, and now,
I am at the fourth stage:

20:04.899 --> 20:07.510
joyful acceptance.

20:07.554 --> 20:11.514
So no more wife-proofing?
No more hiding things?

20:11.558 --> 20:14.996
Uh-uh. Oh. I do have
one small confession.

20:15.039 --> 20:19.348
What?I got a huge crush
on the new guy.

20:19.392 --> 20:22.003
Aw.

20:23.874 --> 20:25.833

20:25.876 --> 20:27.182

20:27.226 --> 20:30.185
You know, he's got a TV now.

20:30.229 --> 20:34.494
And sometimes,

20:34.537 --> 20:36.322

20:36.365 --> 20:39.760

Yeah.

20:52.468 --> 20:55.428
