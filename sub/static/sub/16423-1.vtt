00:49.177 --> 00:52.978
Dende hills is hard to take over.

00:53.178 --> 00:56.663
We are going to mess with the 'outsiders'

00:56.821 --> 01:00.480
'Cause I am gonna tell how things work in Dende.

01:00.680 --> 01:04.166
Here, we don't take it easy, neither do DRE

01:04.366 --> 01:08.682
Even the BOPE are scared shitless to come up here.

01:08.882 --> 01:11.283
We don't take it easy with the armies, civil PD or MPD.

01:11.483 --> 01:15.084
I have the respect of all my Hood.

01:15.284 --> 01:19.184
But Dende hills is also a land of God.

01:22.481 --> 01:24.946
In God we trust! DJ! Come on!

01:39.549 --> 01:42.779
Rio de Janeiro got
over than 700 slums.

01:42.890 --> 01:47.225
Most of them taken over
by gangsters armed to the teeth.

01:48.651 --> 01:53.051
Fellas carrying AR15,
pistols, Uzi, HK, and so on.

01:54.652 --> 01:58.253
In all over the world those weapons
are used to make war,

01:58.453 --> 02:01.088
In Rio, they are for the crime.

02:03.754 --> 02:08.598
A 762's shot can pass through a
car like a piece of paper.

02:08.727 --> 02:14.822
It's silly to think that in Rio the
cops go to the slums only to keep the law.

02:15.022 --> 02:16.657
Cops got family, bro.

02:16.857 --> 02:18.807
They also have fear of death.

02:19.007 --> 02:21.457
Which way?
The alley here!

02:24.358 --> 02:27.259
It's because of that that
cops must decide between...

02:27.459 --> 02:31.794
to be corrupt, to retreat
or just join the war.

02:34.759 --> 02:37.759
Most people don't like war.

02:38.960 --> 02:40.861
And Major Oliveira wasn't an exception.
Every Friday he used to go

02:41.061 --> 02:46.112
to the slums to collect the 'arrego',
which is the money that corrupt cops get...

02:46.312 --> 02:48.163
to take it easy with the traffic.

02:48.363 --> 02:50.919
Wake up, Marcinho!
Go ahead, Sinistro?

02:51.119 --> 02:52.981
Keep an eye, 'cuz the 'pigs' are coming

02:53.181 --> 02:55.168
That's cool, Bihope!
Let them come in as well!

02:55.368 --> 02:58.866
The gangsters fight too but
they also want their bread.

02:59.066 --> 03:03.401
Why fight against the cops
since they can make deal?

03:05.067 --> 03:06.368
But, that night...

03:06.568 --> 03:09.118
there was an officer who
wasn't there for the money.

03:09.318 --> 03:11.318
That was Officer Fabio

03:11.444 --> 03:15.269
He was forced to go
and he was scared shitless

03:22.069 --> 03:24.920
If Fabio wasn't in that mobile,

03:25.120 --> 03:28.690
neither Neto or Matias would be there.

03:33.470 --> 03:36.771
Neto and Matias would never retreat,
or become corrupt.

03:36.971 --> 03:39.071
They were honest.

03:41.072 --> 03:43.072
Cheers!

03:51.071 --> 03:56.071
Did they drop off the mobile?
Can you see Fabio?

03:59.072 --> 04:02.095
No worry!
It's a joy to come today.

04:02.295 --> 04:05.185
What the hell?
Go, go, fuck sake!

04:05.309 --> 04:06.076
Can you see Fabio there?

04:06.276 --> 04:08.977
I'll deal with that!

04:09.177 --> 04:11.897
What's going on?
Hold on, dude!

04:12.476 --> 04:16.031
Whas' up, Oliveira!

04:16.232 --> 04:19.293
It's true that the peace in Rio
depends on a fragile balance.

04:19.494 --> 04:23.035
Between the ammo of the gangsters
and the corruption of the cops.

04:23.235 --> 04:25.330
Honesty doesn't play the game.

04:25.530 --> 04:26.881
What's the story?

04:27.081 --> 04:28.631
I'll deal with that, bro!

04:28.831 --> 04:30.881
God damn it! Did you see Fabio?

04:31.081 --> 04:34.056
Hold a sec, dude!
What's going on?

04:35.082 --> 04:38.983
It's a stable balance that could be
broken by the smallest breeze and...

04:39.183 --> 04:42.288
on that Friday night there was
a strong wind in Babilonia.

04:42.488 --> 04:46.589
It was the night that Neto and Matias
decided to go to war.

04:46.789 --> 04:50.189
Fuck! Who'd you shoot?
Come on. Lets go!

04:50.190 --> 04:53.091
Damn it! What the fuck is that?
There's two 'pigs' around.

04:53.291 --> 04:55.501
Who'd you shoot?
Follow me!

04:55.692 --> 04:57.692
Come with me, damn it!

04:59.492 --> 05:00.693
Fuck!

05:00.893 --> 05:02.794
Damn it, Marcinho, hurry up!

05:02.994 --> 05:04.095
Hurry up, Marcinho!

05:04.295 --> 05:05.996
Fuck, the two 'pigs' are coming.

05:06.196 --> 05:06.997
Fuck you, bastard.

05:07.197 --> 05:09.197
Fuck you!

05:14.894 --> 05:16.894
Bollocks!

05:21.536 --> 05:23.536
Move! Move!

05:38.696 --> 05:40.097
Damn it!

05:40.297 --> 05:42.797
Hey guy, we're gonna die!

05:44.298 --> 05:45.098
We're gonna die!

05:45.298 --> 05:46.949
Don't stop shooting!

05:47.149 --> 05:49.149
Fuck!

05:50.800 --> 05:53.301
Fuck sake!

05:53.501 --> 05:54.602
We're gonna die!

05:54.802 --> 05:55.902
No way, brother!

05:56.102 --> 05:57.003
I am gonna die!

05:57.203 --> 05:58.104
Fuck!

05:58.304 --> 06:00.304
I am low on my ammo!

06:06.003 --> 06:07.804
Patience, take it easy, that's all we need!

06:08.004 --> 06:10.705
We gonna get there,
make our job, taking it easy, right?

06:10.905 --> 06:15.055
There will be a big crowd 'cause of the rock concert.
We will go very slow there,

06:15.255 --> 06:18.105
there might be injured cops!
Slow down!

06:18.305 --> 06:20.806
If Rio depends only on the conventional police

06:21.006 --> 06:22.856
the dealers would have
been taken over easily.

06:23.056 --> 06:27.908
That's the reason the BOPE was formed.
The Elite Squad of the Military Police.

06:28.108 --> 06:30.709
Who of you guys has been in 'Babilonia'?

06:30.909 --> 06:32.710
I did, 'Zero-one'.
You will take the front!

06:32.910 --> 06:35.011
Beside the main road. To the right!

06:35.211 --> 06:38.012
In theory,
the BOPE is just part of the Police System.

06:38.212 --> 06:42.462
In fact,
it's a completely different police system.

06:44.013 --> 06:47.614
The BOPE's logo shows exactly what
happens every time we go to the slums.

06:47.814 --> 06:50.615
And we don't use blue uniform.
We use black one.

06:50.815 --> 06:53.015
Hey, This is BOPE! Nobody moves!

06:53.215 --> 06:56.316
You behave yourself and stay quiet here!

06:56.516 --> 06:57.716
Behave yourself!

06:57.916 --> 07:01.717
The BOPE was formed to intervene when the
conventional police can't deal with the situation.

07:01.917 --> 07:04.618
When it comes about Rio, this always happens.

07:04.818 --> 07:07.793
'Stab the skull, no money at all'!

07:11.118 --> 07:16.220
My name is Captain Nascimento.
I controlled the BOPE's Alpha team.

07:16.420 --> 07:18.421
It's been a long time since
I first joined that war.

07:18.621 --> 07:20.722
And I was starting to feel sick of it.

07:20.922 --> 07:50.122
Elite Squad is a hard nut to crack,
It beats one, it beats all, so it will beat you too!

08:04.122 --> 08:05.873
My darling, I wish I was there too,

08:06.073 --> 08:08.423
But I gotta work.

08:09.224 --> 08:16.724
Can I hear his heartbeat?
Show me!

08:20.525 --> 08:22.826
My, it's strong, isn't it?

08:23.026 --> 08:23.876
Very fast!

08:24.076 --> 08:28.127
Listen, I gotta go 'cause I am at work.

08:28.327 --> 08:32.727
No worries 'cause I put it on the
microwave when I get there.

08:32.928 --> 08:34.928
Alright.

08:35.078 --> 08:39.328
The only way to finish the war in this
city is to disarm the gangsters.

08:39.529 --> 08:41.429
He's on target, Captain!

08:41.630 --> 08:45.030
That's why the main priority of the BOPE

08:45.131 --> 08:46.932
is not to arrest the gangsters,
But to get the guns.

08:47.132 --> 08:49.983
What's up Pompeu? Got the pieces?
Yep.

08:50.183 --> 08:53.233
Here they are.
OK!

08:54.834 --> 08:56.535
In my time, the MPD had 30,000 officers,

08:56.735 --> 08:59.625
bad trained, bad paid, and loaded.

08:59.730 --> 09:02.236
BOPE had only 100 cops.

09:02.436 --> 09:06.431
Damn it,
I want to blow their assholes heads up!

09:06.584 --> 09:07.788
Which one, Captain?

09:07.988 --> 09:10.638
Those scumbags of MPD.

09:12.139 --> 09:15.440
For each gun that we apprehend
there was 3 new more coming.

09:15.640 --> 09:17.441
'Zero-fourteen',
let them do the business

09:17.641 --> 09:19.442
'cause Renan will deal with them later on.

09:19.642 --> 09:21.643
I lost my count of how many times

09:21.843 --> 09:25.094
I worked the night shift
because of the corrupt cops.

09:25.294 --> 09:28.045
'Zero-one',
this can kill two birds with one...

09:28.245 --> 09:32.045
Is it 100%, 'Fourteen'?
'Skull', Captain.

09:33.046 --> 09:35.256
So, fire in the shit hole!

09:36.147 --> 09:42.147
For me,those who support
gangsters are accomplices of them.

09:57.048 --> 10:03.349
Yea, Dude, I have to say
that I was just about to blow up!

10:03.549 --> 10:06.849
And my life was sink or swim.

10:40.388 --> 10:42.354
Good morning.
Good morning, darling.

10:42.554 --> 10:46.705
Let me take this.
Hey, darling, I set the table for you

10:46.905 --> 10:49.794
Take your seat.
I gotta leave, darling.

10:49.994 --> 10:51.332
I have to get earlier in the battalion.

10:51.532 --> 10:53.399
Damn it!
You got late at home yesterday

10:53.599 --> 10:55.979
and you are already leaving!

10:58.532 --> 11:01.255
I had a shitty sleep today.

11:01.455 --> 11:02.438
Is the baby ok?

11:02.638 --> 11:03.289
Of course he's not!

11:03.489 --> 11:05.790
I'm always waiting,
he feels the same too.

11:05.990 --> 11:08.965
He didn't put on pounds last time.

11:10.004 --> 11:12.264
What do you want me to do?
Quit the job?

11:12.464 --> 11:17.712
If I knew that you wouldn't quit
I'd never become pregnant!

11:17.912 --> 11:19.912
The war has its price.

11:21.161 --> 11:23.480
And when the price goes very high

11:23.680 --> 11:25.305
it's time to get out of it.

11:25.505 --> 11:27.099
Goodbye.

11:27.299 --> 11:30.529
Hey darling, take a piece of bread...

11:34.260 --> 11:35.892
If you just watch time goes by

11:36.092 --> 11:40.686
You may lose your last
chance to get out of it alive.

11:43.461 --> 11:44.660
I was searching for a substitute.

11:44.860 --> 11:45.661
But it's not that simple

11:45.861 --> 11:47.496
to become a Captain of BOPE.

11:47.696 --> 11:51.534
And to find someone who's honest,
brave, with mind and heart

11:51.734 --> 11:53.714
of policeman to stay on my position.

11:53.914 --> 11:55.365
It was almost impossible.

11:55.565 --> 11:58.205
Capt. Fabio, maintenance supervisor and
Chief of the first regiment.

11:58.405 --> 12:01.413
Capt. Oliveira,
Chief of the third regiment, and Major State.

12:01.613 --> 12:03.908
And it take 3 years of studies

12:04.086 --> 12:05.048
to join the Company.

12:05.248 --> 12:06.801
First day of job is frustrating.

12:07.001 --> 12:07.802
But along the way

12:08.002 --> 12:08.803
most of rookies

12:09.003 --> 12:11.003
get disappointed.

12:11.184 --> 12:13.552
Rookies, you are welcome.

12:13.752 --> 12:18.776
Keep in mind that up to now
you are in probationary job.

12:18.976 --> 12:23.417
And you will be checked by me
and Major State.

12:23.617 --> 12:25.617
I want you to know that

12:25.740 --> 12:26.867
this officer's team

12:27.067 --> 12:28.198
which I have the honor to lead,

12:28.398 --> 12:32.044
is a big family

12:32.244 --> 12:34.053
and is the best of the Company.

12:34.253 --> 12:37.823
Estevao,
Take the rookies to their duties.

12:38.660 --> 12:41.150
By that time I didn't know Matias and Neto.

12:41.350 --> 12:46.747
I hadn't any idea that I could need
the intelligence of one and the heart of the other.

12:46.947 --> 12:50.312
If I could put It all together,
the story would have been different.

12:50.512 --> 12:53.440
It wouldn't have been hard to quit BOPE.

12:53.640 --> 12:56.275
But who said that life is easy?

12:56.435 --> 12:59.246
That's the place you gonna start, rookie.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.684
This is the car repair shop?

13:00.884 --> 13:02.274
Yep, why?
Is that a problem?

13:02.474 --> 13:05.489
Could you put me in another station?
I don't know nothing about cars.

13:05.689 --> 13:10.300
Listen, we have 46 cars and
12 bikes, it's up to you to make

13:10.500 --> 13:13.135
all this shit working properly.

13:14.853 --> 13:16.853
Captain!
At ease.

13:17.189 --> 13:20.945
Those two fellas are your assistants.

13:21.145 --> 13:21.946
Alright.

13:22.146 --> 13:26.681
249, will be on the streets until the
end of the day like I promised, Sir.

13:26.881 --> 13:28.632
About time, Tiao!

13:28.832 --> 13:32.051
Captain,
but the new parts didn't come yet.

13:32.251 --> 13:34.724
I'm finishing the clutch of the one here.

13:34.924 --> 13:37.227
It is a brand new one.
What's the problem with the windows?

13:37.427 --> 13:38.228
Windshield, I know,
but, I recycled

13:38.428 --> 13:42.690
engine, clutch...
Shut up, I don't want to know

13:42.890 --> 13:47.820
about this shit anymore.
This is the rookie's business now.

13:48.018 --> 13:51.207
Rookie.
Lieutenant.

13:51.407 --> 13:53.407
Relax, enjoy it

13:53.541 --> 13:56.459
there's ham sandwich, some coffee,
chilled water...

13:56.659 --> 14:01.975
I am not hungry! You start work immediately
'cause I want to get the car until the end of the day!

14:02.175 --> 14:05.355
But we don't have parts.
You'd better talk to the Captain.

14:05.555 --> 14:09.078
Anyway, no jokes and start work.

14:09.278 --> 14:11.693
'cause I don't want to stay here for all day. Move!
Sir?!

14:11.893 --> 14:14.583
Drop that bread now!
Come on!

14:14.783 --> 14:17.673
I don't care,
you better work now!

14:17.776 --> 14:19.158
Neto was an impulsive guy

14:19.358 --> 14:21.291
who used to do it before thinking.

14:21.491 --> 14:22.426
On the other hand, Matias

14:22.626 --> 14:23.427
used to think a lot

14:23.627 --> 14:25.225
before doing it.

14:25.425 --> 14:27.363
Do you see that pile of papers?

14:27.563 --> 14:29.264
Each page is a register

14:29.464 --> 14:30.953
of a murder that MPD couldn't avoid.

14:31.153 --> 14:33.402
That would be just rubbish in Neto's hands.

14:33.602 --> 14:36.185
That would be just statistics in Matias hands.

14:36.385 --> 14:39.051
Rookies,
Matias will work with you now.

14:39.251 --> 14:42.683
How are you?
Those fellas are your assistants

14:42.883 --> 14:43.684
Officer Bruno

14:43.884 --> 14:44.685
Officer Machado

14:44.885 --> 14:47.394
Your job is to look after
the radio operations

14:47.594 --> 14:49.125
And register the occurrences. OK?
Yes, sir.

14:49.325 --> 14:50.126
Your desk is right there.
Yes, sir.

14:50.326 --> 14:55.197
Sorry sir.
Any problem just call me. Have a nice job.

14:55.397 --> 14:57.077
None of both could be compared to me.

14:57.277 --> 15:01.196
But one of them would
have to replace me.

15:10.384 --> 15:12.097
Alright, class. Well,

15:12.297 --> 15:16.910
here they are,
the 10 books that you're gonna use...

15:17.110 --> 15:19.576
Matias was intelligent and dedicated.

15:19.776 --> 15:23.737
In Brazil, who is born black and poor doesn't have
much chances in life.

15:23.937 --> 15:25.312
Groups of four people.

15:25.512 --> 15:28.761
Then you gonna choose
one of these 10 subjects

15:28.961 --> 15:30.732
Hurry guys,
I want to do the Foucalt, right?

15:30.932 --> 15:33.200
So do I.
3 of us.

15:34.413 --> 15:39.853
And Matias had the chance to
join the best College of Law in Rio.

15:40.389 --> 15:43.548
For him, law studies had everything
to do with an officer's job.

15:43.748 --> 15:47.148
For him, officers and lawyers
have the same mission in life.

15:47.348 --> 15:49.136
To keep the law.

15:49.336 --> 15:52.565
No, no, I'm gonna bring it back this way.
Nobody will notice it.

15:52.765 --> 15:53.905
So, let's join a group.

15:54.105 --> 15:54.906
He won't notice.

15:55.106 --> 15:58.834
What you mean?
He won't notice, Beta! I'm sure of that.

15:59.034 --> 16:01.135
Is this the sociology class?
What's your name?

16:01.335 --> 16:03.036
Andre.
Last name?

16:03.236 --> 16:06.937
Andre Matias, why?
You are in our Foucalt's group, ok?

16:07.137 --> 16:08.938
What you talkin about?
I'll tell you in a minute.

16:09.138 --> 16:13.939
Matias ideals were in a right world,
far from Rio's reality.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.140
Hey, I'm Maria.
Nice to meet you.

16:16.340 --> 16:19.241
This is Dudu, Roberta,
we will do the Foucalt.

16:19.441 --> 16:21.842
To join the BOPE,
the fellas must sink or swim

16:22.042 --> 16:23.843
We're gonna do the Foucalt.

16:24.043 --> 16:26.763
Matias still had a lot to learn.

16:27.045 --> 16:29.746
This Fella is coming to Rio

16:29.946 --> 16:33.008
Do you know who I am talking about?

16:33.208 --> 16:35.672
He's gonna stay in
Archbishop's place.

16:35.872 --> 16:37.511
in Turano slum.

16:37.711 --> 16:39.950
And we must keep him safe.

16:40.150 --> 16:40.951
No way!

16:41.151 --> 16:45.201
Turano is at war,
and the Pope wants to stay there?!

16:45.401 --> 16:47.757
I book a room for him in Copacabana.

16:47.957 --> 16:50.794
I've tried to change that.
But not even God can do it

16:50.994 --> 16:53.289
He will stay there anyway!

16:53.402 --> 16:57.057
We have 3 months to bring peace to Turano.

16:57.111 --> 17:01.140
Sorry Sir, but that's not possible.
Do you agree with constant raids?

17:01.340 --> 17:05.165
We're going under the shootings,
without the unexpected element

17:05.365 --> 17:08.846
Someone will gonna die.
Nascimento!

17:09.046 --> 17:13.068
That must be done and
the raids start tomorrow.

17:13.268 --> 17:14.435
Am I clear?
Yes Sir.

17:14.636 --> 17:15.780
Dismissed.

17:15.980 --> 17:21.589
I know that the Pope doesn't have
anything to do with my problems.

17:21.733 --> 17:25.645
But he's been to Rio twice already

17:25.845 --> 17:29.415
Couldn't he know
how things work down here?

17:29.554 --> 17:32.958
Surely no politicians want
to see the Pope being shot.

17:33.158 --> 17:36.560
If the Pope wants to stay
close to a slum,

17:36.760 --> 17:37.561
what could a Mayor do about that?

17:37.761 --> 17:40.328
Take the risk of a stray bullet
hitting The Sanctity's head?

17:40.528 --> 17:42.315
No way.

17:42.515 --> 17:46.535
They might call BOPE

17:46.735 --> 17:54.265
Gods sake, Beto, stop!
I am studying.

17:54.465 --> 17:58.715
You'd better stop study!
Let's get some fresh air.

17:58.861 --> 18:01.674
Will you use the car tomorrow?

18:01.874 --> 18:03.874
Why are you asking?

18:04.000 --> 18:06.376
I'm going to Prazeres slum.
Are you nuts?

18:06.576 --> 18:08.976
What the hell you gonna do in a slum?
My classmates

18:09.176 --> 18:10.237
arranged a meeting there.

18:10.437 --> 18:12.572
You are a cop.
You cannot go to the slums,

18:12.772 --> 18:15.917
they kill you there.
Find another way!

18:16.097 --> 18:19.624
Relax!
Nobody knows that I am a cop.

18:19.824 --> 18:24.077
Be careful!

18:24.277 --> 18:29.995
The Pope needed the BOPE.
The BOPE needed me.

18:30.195 --> 18:32.711
And I needed someone to
replace me.

18:32.911 --> 18:33.712
It wouldn't be easy.

18:33.912 --> 18:38.172
I'd have to do the raids
because of the Pope.

18:38.372 --> 18:42.071
But I would be armed.

18:42.271 --> 18:44.271
And dressed in black.

18:49.708 --> 18:52.699
The problem for a cop that joins a college

18:52.899 --> 18:55.437
is that at first sight the
classmates are nice guys

18:55.637 --> 18:58.604
and there's a lot of chicks
with bad intentions.

18:58.804 --> 18:59.605
What's up?

18:59.805 --> 19:03.493
Thanks for coming.
Nice to meet you.

19:03.693 --> 19:05.988
That's Rose.
That's Helena.

19:06.107 --> 19:06.827
She's gorgeous.

19:07.027 --> 19:13.240
You naughty girl, Rose!
We need this, look!

19:13.440 --> 19:19.396
Don't stare at me!
Sorry to make you come here.

19:19.596 --> 19:21.044
But we have lots to do. Alright?
Ok.

19:21.244 --> 19:26.053
This is the administration office.
This is Rodrigues,

19:26.253 --> 19:29.380
who is helping with the NGO

19:29.580 --> 19:34.792
And represents the sponsors of our community
and is also a big friend of mine.

19:34.992 --> 19:37.908
Do you have vote for Senator already?
No.

19:38.108 --> 19:41.120
Now you got it! That is Magalhaes.
Take more for your friends.

19:41.320 --> 19:46.350
His number is 451, don't forget,
five minus four equals one.

19:46.550 --> 19:50.256
I must admit that at the first
sight is hard to resist.

19:50.456 --> 19:53.980
Rich students like to help poor children.

19:54.180 --> 19:57.805
And who doesn't care about them?
Romerito, this is Andre.

19:58.005 --> 20:00.607
How is it going?
Fine.

20:00.807 --> 20:03.199
Maria, can we go to the arcades games?

20:03.399 --> 20:05.397
I can't make it today,
I got job to do.

20:05.597 --> 20:06.645
How about you?
No homework?

20:06.845 --> 20:08.373
Yes, I have,
but I ll do it later.

20:08.573 --> 20:13.310
Who said to me that he would study, huh?
Matias was a naive boy.

20:13.510 --> 20:15.860
And had a sweet heart. It was
natural that he could get involved.

20:16.060 --> 20:18.635
Does he have problems in school?
Yes, he does.

20:18.835 --> 20:21.070
Did you ever check what
could be behind that?

20:21.270 --> 20:23.899
He just refuse to study.
Maybe there is something wrong.

20:24.099 --> 20:26.367
But there's a limit of involvement
that cops cannot pass.

20:26.567 --> 20:30.532
He should have known how to break

20:30.732 --> 20:31.956
the involvements when it's time too.
I saw that.

20:32.156 --> 20:37.114
And Falcaut is the word for
criminal law in power descriptions.

20:37.314 --> 20:41.054
And in fact doesn't have any
social contract.

20:41.672 --> 20:42.939
Did you get it?
Besides that.

20:43.139 --> 20:48.790
The state always deal with 'institutions'.
Hard word, isn't it? Institutions

20:48.990 --> 20:52.006
To control and punish the criminals.
Did you get it?

20:52.206 --> 20:55.915
Like the Cumo de Plata hills, in that
prison of...

20:56.115 --> 20:57.568
I have to admit that...
I'm stoned!

20:57.768 --> 21:00.061
they have mixed...
For Foucalt, the historical analysis

21:00.261 --> 21:03.481
of those institutions, reveals the state...
Hey you Andre!

21:03.681 --> 21:07.343
No thanks, Roberta!
I don't enjoy it!

21:07.543 --> 21:08.752
Pick it!
No, no, thanks.

21:08.952 --> 21:12.000
Relax.
This is exactly what

21:12.200 --> 21:13.001
our teacher has asked us.
This shit is so good.

21:13.201 --> 21:17.891
This is cool. Awesome!
Good stuff.

21:18.091 --> 21:21.296
If the guy is carefree
he ends up being seduced by his mates.

21:21.496 --> 21:28.770
The right thing to be done was to caught them
and arrest them under the code 12 of the 6368 law.

21:28.970 --> 21:33.071
Officers must keep the law.

21:33.271 --> 21:40.581
Matias just joined the college and he was just
taking it easy with his friends already.

21:43.140 --> 21:45.026
I think our job
is pretty good.

21:45.226 --> 21:46.627
Romerito!
Romerito!

21:46.827 --> 21:49.252
I thought you said that you
were going back home

21:49.452 --> 21:50.853
to study!

21:51.053 --> 21:55.846
If he was carefree he
would end up like them.

21:56.046 --> 22:01.719
Hold on!
Give me your hand.

22:01.919 --> 22:04.060
What you gonna do?
Hold on people.

22:04.260 --> 22:05.862
Don't look, dude.

22:06.062 --> 22:09.025
Lets see if you are that 'smart'.

22:09.225 --> 22:12.034
What letter is this one?
It's an 'A'.

22:12.234 --> 22:15.815
Very good.
How about now? What it says?

22:16.015 --> 22:20.732
I can't see. What is that?
It's an 'A'.

22:20.932 --> 22:22.899
A? -Yes!
See it, his problem is with his left eye.

22:23.099 --> 22:24.518
Haven't you noticed that before?

22:24.718 --> 22:26.053
That's the reason he's not doing
well in school!

22:26.253 --> 22:29.259
Yeah, I know 'cause I used to have

22:29.459 --> 22:30.496
the same problem in school.

22:30.696 --> 22:32.518
Lets tell your mom, right?
Come on, Andre.

22:32.718 --> 22:34.608
Where's that?
It's close here, come on.

22:34.808 --> 22:35.609
Up there?

22:35.809 --> 22:39.985
To be Captain of BOPE and replace me,

22:40.185 --> 22:41.828
Matias had to learn that
you cannot take it easy.

22:42.028 --> 22:44.493
Gangsters don't take it easy.

22:46.895 --> 22:48.895
What's up, dude?

22:49.486 --> 22:52.200
How are you?
I took that exam.

22:52.400 --> 22:54.047
So, did you pass?
Yes, sure!

22:54.247 --> 22:56.552
That's my boy! See it Romerito?

22:56.752 --> 23:04.358
Make yourself at home!
The guys have social conscience.

23:09.259 --> 23:14.486
I wear glasses, too.
Maria?

23:14.686 --> 23:17.904
I must go!
Why?

23:18.104 --> 23:20.475
I have to bring my friends car back.

23:20.675 --> 23:21.476
Ok?
Ok.

23:21.676 --> 23:25.588
And about the glasses of our buddy
I'll take care of it.

23:25.788 --> 23:29.029
No worries!
Someone has done that for me

23:29.229 --> 23:32.299
when I was a child,
so I wanna do that for him too.

23:32.499 --> 23:33.827
Right?

23:34.027 --> 23:34.828
Ok?
Ok!

23:35.028 --> 23:37.162
I see you!
See you!

23:37.362 --> 23:39.277
I'll be back to meet your mom, right?

23:39.477 --> 23:40.272
Cheers.
Deal.

23:40.472 --> 23:41.273
Bye.
Bye.

23:41.473 --> 23:48.815
You gonna get there
with your glasses.

23:49.015 --> 23:51.494
What's up, dude?
What's up?

23:51.694 --> 23:54.140
'Baiano' was the big boss of NGO slum.

23:54.340 --> 24:00.134
I know how his story ends
but I don't know how it started.

24:00.334 --> 24:04.079
He should have had a miserable childhood
and to become a gangster.

24:04.279 --> 24:05.856
Maybe it was his last resort.

24:06.056 --> 24:12.066
So, what's up, dudes?
That's the 'hot stuff'

24:12.266 --> 24:16.689
Take it, 'Xuxa'.
'Xaveco' bring it on.

24:16.889 --> 24:19.488
What makes me pissed off is the guy
who had options and ended

24:19.688 --> 24:21.951
up in this parallel life.

24:22.151 --> 24:26.605
I've already said that before
and emphasize it again.

24:26.805 --> 24:29.833
Those who support the dealers,
are accomplices and must go to jail.

24:30.033 --> 24:35.124
Whas' up?

24:35.324 --> 24:38.201
Whas' up?

24:38.401 --> 24:39.202
Bruno!

24:39.402 --> 24:40.203
Whas' up?

24:40.403 --> 24:42.403
Whas' up?

24:44.834 --> 24:46.834
Cheers!

24:49.604 --> 24:53.976
Marcio, I got the 'stuff' here.
Whas' up? Are you alright?

24:54.176 --> 24:54.977
Get in, come on.

24:55.177 --> 25:01.712
Excuse me!
Hold a sec, ok?

25:01.912 --> 25:12.670
Where is that?
Here, dude, all for you.

25:12.870 --> 25:13.671
How many kilos you got?
2kg

25:13.871 --> 25:15.833
Only that?
Do you think its easy to get

25:16.033 --> 25:17.607
good stuff without payment in advance?

25:17.807 --> 25:22.228
Pay attention!
Two thousand bucks here.

25:22.428 --> 25:29.442
Bring as much as you can 'cause
the guys can't stop buying.

25:29.642 --> 25:33.881
Then I ask to myself:
'how many kids have to die only 'cause

25:34.081 --> 25:34.882
one 'playboy' decided to smoke weed?'

25:35.082 --> 25:39.704
The priority is to take the guns from them.

25:39.904 --> 25:41.522
We gonna take it through alley 2.

25:41.722 --> 25:45.086
Azevedo, get your team to go over
the bishops place.

25:45.286 --> 25:47.443
Renan and Marcelo, over
Tamandare St. -Yes Sir!

25:47.643 --> 25:52.674
Nascimento, do you know the entrance
over the 117?

25:55.219 --> 25:59.639
Captain Nascimento, do you know
the entrance of 117?

26:01.416 --> 26:02.888
I know, Sir!

26:03.088 --> 26:08.837
In this case you go with him,
but be careful, there's lots of students.

26:09.037 --> 26:10.061
I know Carvalho.

26:10.261 --> 26:13.969
I already told you that I got a bad
feeling about this.

26:14.169 --> 26:16.169
Orders must be obeyed.

26:16.310 --> 26:20.367
You will go to Arraia Alley
which is on the middle of the hills.

26:20.567 --> 26:24.400
Did you get it?
'SKULL'!

27:15.374 --> 27:19.205
For me, strategy has logic when
the mission has some sense.

27:19.405 --> 27:22.165
The 'Pope's Operation' is a stupid thing.

27:22.365 --> 27:25.601
In normal situations, I would feel pissed off.
But...

27:25.801 --> 27:27.698
My son was about to be born.

27:27.898 --> 27:30.178
I couldn't take it easy.

27:30.378 --> 27:33.183
I didn't want to die for nothing.

27:45.846 --> 27:47.846
Come up!

28:20.117 --> 28:20.914
Freeze! Freeze!

28:21.114 --> 28:22.981
Everybody to the ground!

28:23.181 --> 28:23.982
Lay down, you bastard!

28:24.182 --> 28:26.182
To the ground!

28:38.384 --> 28:39.785
Where's the dealer?

28:39.985 --> 28:42.302
None of them escaped, Sir.
The dealer is among them!

28:42.502 --> 28:44.675
I want you all to line up here!

28:44.875 --> 28:48.882
Move, move!

28:49.082 --> 28:55.948
I am gonna ask just once!
Who was carrying the delivery?

28:56.148 --> 28:59.332
None of us!

28:59.532 --> 29:00.333
I don't know sir!
Who was with the delivery?

29:00.533 --> 29:01.334
Who was with the delivery?

29:01.534 --> 29:03.236
I am a student.

29:03.436 --> 29:06.288
-What the fuck? Move here!

29:06.488 --> 29:07.340
Hurry!

29:07.540 --> 29:09.940
Put your face here!

29:11.444 --> 29:16.177
Can you see that hole here?
Who killed this guy?

29:16.377 --> 29:18.377
I don't know.

29:18.497 --> 29:22.435
Yes, of course you do!
Who killed him? Say muthafucker!

29:22.635 --> 29:24.179
Who killed him?

29:24.379 --> 29:25.967
One of you.

29:26.167 --> 29:28.922
One of us, my ass!

29:29.122 --> 29:36.267
You killed this guy here, you fuckin fag!
You've been sponsoring all this holy shit.

29:36.467 --> 29:39.034
You fuckin bastard!

29:41.535 --> 29:46.550
We are here to fix the shit you started!
You piece of shit!

29:48.026 --> 29:51.698
You put money in that shit!
You faggot!

29:51.898 --> 29:55.409
Who was carrying the delivery?

30:00.797 --> 30:04.452
'Zero-seven',
bring the 'little devil' up here.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.570
Let's check now!

30:09.141 --> 30:10.822
Tell us now!
Come on!

30:11.022 --> 30:13.384
Show us now!

30:13.584 --> 30:15.183
Who was with the delivery?
Come on, tell us!

30:15.383 --> 30:16.397
Tell us, you motherfucker!

30:16.597 --> 30:21.565
This one with the hood.
So that's you motherfucker!

30:22.567 --> 30:27.943
Take him to the PD.
With the delivery.

30:28.143 --> 30:32.658
It's your lucky day, you stupid.
I am not playing the game with you!

30:32.858 --> 30:34.858
Move it!
Move!

30:38.029 --> 30:40.029
Run!

30:47.860 --> 30:53.454
Well, we finally concluded that in Brazil,
the criminal law works like a web.

30:53.654 --> 30:57.568
Which controls a lots of
repressive institutions of the state.

30:57.768 --> 31:06.361
And unfortunately, today, the consequences
of what Foucalt says ended up

31:06.561 --> 31:10.914
creating a State which protects the
riches and punishes exclusively the poor.

31:11.114 --> 31:16.755
Alright, 'finito'
I think that Maria and all the group

31:16.955 --> 31:22.070
has shown very clear, how the power relates,
and not only the state molds bad institutions.

31:22.270 --> 31:27.464
Now to conclude,
we could do an analysis of each one.

31:27.664 --> 31:32.169
Give me an example of one
institution that fits on it.

31:32.343 --> 31:35.318
The Police.
The police, very good!

31:35.695 --> 31:40.200
But, why the police?
'Cause everybody here knows that

31:40.373 --> 31:44.175
in the slums they don't trust anybody.
They beat everyone.

31:44.375 --> 31:51.534
Edu is right. The police act perversely
against the miserable ones,

31:51.734 --> 31:57.514
and those who are compelled to commit
crimes because of their conditions.

31:57.932 --> 31:58.936
Gusmao!
Go ahead!

31:59.136 --> 32:00.444
I'd like to say that

32:00.644 --> 32:04.106
I have to agree with Edu.

32:04.306 --> 32:06.860
But I think the cops don't

32:07.060 --> 32:08.710
threaten only the poor classes.

32:08.910 --> 32:13.702
I think that we, from medium and high class
are also victims of those guys.

32:13.902 --> 32:16.508
One time I was going with Maria and Natalia

32:16.708 --> 32:19.760
to Buzios and we were blocked in a checkpoint

32:19.960 --> 32:23.961
and they were very threatening.

32:24.161 --> 32:28.436
Thrusting at us with their guns...
But they didn't hit you!

32:28.636 --> 32:30.427
Oh come on!
They showed us the guns.

32:30.627 --> 32:31.428
Stop!
Calm down!

32:31.628 --> 32:33.628
Go ahead!

32:38.255 --> 32:42.994
My father is a judge and he said that in
the Baixada slums the smallest of the punishments

32:43.194 --> 32:50.543
is the torture. They go there and kill everybody.
It's like 'chainsaw massacre'.

32:50.743 --> 32:52.055
Besides that, they are cowards!

32:52.255 --> 32:55.022
Hold on class!

32:56.223 --> 33:00.761
Everybody will have their chance.
Now let's listen to Matias,

33:00.961 --> 33:02.115
who's in the line, waiting.
Go ahead Matias.

33:02.315 --> 33:06.565
Gusmao, well,
I think that most guys have opinions

33:06.673 --> 33:07.471
very uninformed of what really happens

33:07.671 --> 33:08.472
Hold on!

33:08.672 --> 33:13.020
Very uninformed!
Let him speak!

33:13.220 --> 33:17.589
I could admit that there is corruption on
the PD, but in the majority

33:17.789 --> 33:23.144
the officers just want to do their job, with honesty.
Bullshit!

33:26.780 --> 33:28.780
Hold on!!

33:29.313 --> 33:31.340
Edu is right!
Who here has never been

33:31.540 --> 33:33.441
in a checkpoint like in Buzios?

33:33.641 --> 33:39.461
This is very common, the guys want
money, they are corrupt and Edu is right.

33:39.661 --> 33:44.735
In NGO they say that first they shoot you,

33:44.935 --> 33:47.377
then they find out who's criminal and who's not.
You are mixed up!

33:47.577 --> 33:51.777
So, let's respect and let him finish his point of view.
That's sensible!

33:51.977 --> 33:56.634
So, Gusmao, the fact is,
I got a close friend of mine who is a cop.

33:56.834 --> 34:02.709
And his best friend is a cop as well.
Both are honest.

34:02.909 --> 34:10.362
Talking about Buzios facts, I think they were right.
Surely! Hold on!

34:11.342 --> 34:16.036
Why not? You must had some weed, hadn't you?
You don't know how many kids

34:16.237 --> 34:20.199
join the crime and die because
of joints and cocaine.

34:20.400 --> 34:24.583
From your fine penthouse in South Zone,
you can't see those kind of things. Right?

34:24.784 --> 34:31.196
You got bad information. You all
are influenced by the crap news and media.

34:33.893 --> 34:37.688
Well, I think that's all so...
See you next Monday.

34:37.888 --> 34:43.748
Mr. Nascimento, right?
Were you on that last operation in the slums?

34:46.437 --> 34:48.437
Yeah, I was.

34:49.149 --> 34:50.069
Well, Sir,

34:50.268 --> 34:51.864
I just came down here

34:52.065 --> 34:56.447
'cause I want my right to bury my son.

34:57.876 --> 34:59.876
Mrs. Rejane

35:00.253 --> 35:03.108
Has your son worked for the gangsters?

35:03.308 --> 35:08.097
Yes sir.
He was the 'look-out'.

35:08.360 --> 35:09.695
We didn't kill your son.

35:09.895 --> 35:11.208
But you let him go.

35:11.408 --> 35:14.080
Didn't you?

35:14.280 --> 35:17.603
Did you think the gangsters
would forgive him?

35:17.803 --> 35:21.365
Gangsters kill those who
open their mouth,

35:21.565 --> 35:24.036
and I knew that, somehow.

35:24.236 --> 35:26.491
The boy's mom made me feel regret.

35:26.691 --> 35:29.935
And regret is a dangerous feeling
for someone who works in BOPE.

35:30.135 --> 35:34.781
Was he your only son?
Yes, sir.

35:34.981 --> 35:38.241
I felt that Rosane was right.

35:38.441 --> 35:42.691
It's been about time to find someone
to replace me.

35:47.258 --> 35:50.291
Engine carbon, what else?
Battery

35:50.491 --> 35:52.444
Brake Pads.
Volkswagen's carburetor.

35:52.644 --> 35:55.024
Give me a break, fuck sake!

35:55.213 --> 35:56.014
Brake pads.

35:56.214 --> 35:57.015
Plugs.

35:57.215 --> 35:58.016
Filter.

35:58.216 --> 36:01.269
And the windshield that is broken.

36:01.469 --> 36:04.450
Lieutenant, Volkswagen's carburetor
518.

36:05.651 --> 36:07.719
Volkswagen's carburetor.
Right! Listen to that.

36:07.919 --> 36:10.857
518, this is a brand new
its all electronic ignition.

36:11.057 --> 36:11.858
Listen to that, Lieutenant.

36:12.058 --> 36:15.598
There's no carburetor!
No fuckin carburetor, why so?

36:15.798 --> 36:19.039
No carburetor, electronic ignition.

36:19.239 --> 36:21.620
Listen to the noise, Lieutenant.
No carburetor!

36:21.820 --> 36:25.346
Fuck sake, you kidding?
No, I'm not! No!

36:25.546 --> 36:26.347
Yes, you are!
No carburetor.

36:26.547 --> 36:30.822
Yes, there is!
No, there isn't!

36:31.022 --> 36:34.180
Look at that, why is this so?

36:34.380 --> 36:36.070
Does it have carburetor or not?
Yes.

36:36.270 --> 36:39.610
There is, Lieutenant.
There is,

36:39.810 --> 36:43.318
but this is a recycled engine,
look at this.

36:43.518 --> 36:47.249
loose carbon,
everything is loose here.

36:47.449 --> 36:48.886
What the hell are you talkin' about it?

36:49.086 --> 36:52.599
Another recruit sold the new engine and...
Another who?

36:52.799 --> 36:55.191
Who did that?
I don't know, Lieutenant.

36:55.391 --> 36:57.932
We don't know!
Never mind, this is common here.

36:58.132 --> 37:02.104
Few days ago, they stole the radio system out
of Capt. Salgado's car and nobody did nothing.

37:02.304 --> 37:04.344
Fuck sake,
are you nuts?

37:04.486 --> 37:06.612
Theft is unacceptable here.
This is a PD Headquarter.

37:06.812 --> 37:07.613
HQ!
Oh!

37:07.813 --> 37:10.670
Fuck sake, listen to me?
Let's replace the engine.

37:10.870 --> 37:11.671
Fuck sake!

37:11.871 --> 37:13.372
Neto had a heart of a policeman.

37:13.572 --> 37:17.611
He wanted to fix all the problems
of the battalion.

37:17.811 --> 37:20.978
But in a will to join BOPE squad
the fella cannot be naive.

37:21.178 --> 37:25.642
Neto should learn that to be a
serious officer in Rio, my friend.

37:25.842 --> 37:27.571
It is not easy.
Captain, I got a problem.

37:27.771 --> 37:30.040
They've replaced the engine...
I'm in a hurry, go ahead.

37:30.240 --> 37:32.821
Someone replaced the new engine for
an old one.

37:33.021 --> 37:36.138
I'm sure it was someone from here.
They told who did that?

37:36.338 --> 37:39.643
I'm gonna request an investigation
and pick your name as responsible for it.

37:39.843 --> 37:40.871
Me, Sir?
Yep, you!

37:41.071 --> 37:45.303
But, Sir, I got a bunch of
vehicles here, I need parts...

37:45.503 --> 37:48.420
Listen!
Don't let the Chief's vehicle go dead.

37:48.620 --> 37:50.191
I ask you special attention
for that shit.

37:50.391 --> 37:53.525
Yes, Sir.
Captain!

37:53.725 --> 37:57.210
Go ahead, 'rookie'
The missing parts...

37:58.067 --> 37:59.233
Fuck sake.

37:59.433 --> 38:01.433
Too many parts!

38:02.255 --> 38:04.215
I'll take a look at it for you.

38:04.415 --> 38:07.730
Now go and talk to Fabio 'cause he
can find something for you, too.

38:07.930 --> 38:08.731
How about you?
Dismissed.

38:08.931 --> 38:12.342
It doesn't do any good
to play the same tune.

38:12.542 --> 38:17.718
To fix the problems of PD
you must require the systems' help.

38:17.918 --> 38:21.939
The PD Battalions were abandoned
by the Public Security System.

38:22.139 --> 38:24.028
Without the corruption or the
Brazilian way, the police

38:24.228 --> 38:27.317
stops due to lack of maintenance.

38:27.517 --> 38:31.477
You won't do the stuff by yourself.
I just want to put my vehicles

38:31.677 --> 38:34.347
to work, 'cause I don't want
to stay in that sector anymore.

38:34.547 --> 38:36.475
I hate that car repair shop.

38:36.675 --> 38:41.386
You will go to...
'You will go to fuck yourself.'

38:41.586 --> 38:43.288
Just go, just drive it.

38:43.488 --> 38:45.059
The first theft is always for
a good cause.

38:45.259 --> 38:49.842
But, those who become corrupt for the
battalion are corrupt for the family also.

38:50.042 --> 38:52.762
That is the logic of the system.

38:53.135 --> 38:55.337
That's the reason every time a civilian sees
a mobile in front of their

38:55.537 --> 38:59.001
bakeries, bars, they know what that means!
What do you mean with 'no money'?

38:59.201 --> 39:01.176
I am here to collect my 'bread'.
You are closing, aren't you?

39:01.376 --> 39:03.147
Yes, I am, Captain, but I

39:03.347 --> 39:05.638
already dealt with someone today.
No way, you didn't.

39:05.838 --> 39:09.195
You haven't deal with me yet.
Look at the guys behind you.

39:09.395 --> 39:10.261
I dealt with Oliveira.

39:10.461 --> 39:11.262
Oliveira?

39:11.462 --> 39:15.607
If I deal with you again,
I'd be broke.

39:15.807 --> 39:20.720
You are breaking me this way.
I do security for you and you pay Oliveira?

39:20.920 --> 39:22.214
Why don't you deal with him?

39:22.414 --> 39:25.136
After all,
you work in the same place.

39:25.336 --> 39:27.023
Come on.

39:27.223 --> 39:28.595
How much for that pint?
Nothing.

39:28.795 --> 39:32.031
I want to pay for that!

39:32.231 --> 39:34.215
Since the big deal of the PD is to protect,

39:34.415 --> 39:37.505
the system has twisted protection into business.

39:37.705 --> 39:39.206
But those who bribe to keep the law

39:39.406 --> 39:42.428
also bribe to make things harder.

39:42.991 --> 39:43.330
Hey!

39:43.530 --> 39:45.514
That guy is charging my customers.

39:45.714 --> 39:46.959
Even the tow truck is here, damn it!

39:47.159 --> 39:48.589
I can't support you this way.

39:48.789 --> 39:50.252
Who gave this order?

39:50.452 --> 39:51.253
I don't know.

39:51.453 --> 39:52.380
Give me the car parts!

39:52.580 --> 39:53.381
There's nothing here.

39:53.581 --> 39:55.844
Who gave the order?
Don't know, look that guy.

39:56.044 --> 39:58.071
Hey 'Lil Beatle'!
Fly down here.

39:58.271 --> 39:59.344
'How are you', my ass!

39:59.544 --> 40:01.912
Move here, hurry up!

40:02.112 --> 40:04.563
What the fuck are you doing?
You are charging

40:04.763 --> 40:06.144
in my area, you cannot do that!

40:06.344 --> 40:09.392
Ademar is 'friend' of the Battalion.
Sorry for that,

40:09.592 --> 40:11.875
but I'm doing my work.
Who the hell sent you here?

40:12.075 --> 40:12.876
Bira!
Bira who?

40:13.076 --> 40:14.563
Who is Bira?
Who the hell is Bira?

40:14.763 --> 40:15.564
Bira!

40:15.764 --> 40:17.698
Bira!
Bira, come up here!

40:17.898 --> 40:18.699
I'm busy!

40:18.899 --> 40:21.329
The system filled all
the cracks in.

40:21.529 --> 40:23.618
The Government was so fuckin' broken

40:23.818 --> 40:27.090
that it didn't have cash to buy
tow trucks for the Police.

40:27.290 --> 40:28.464
They decide to have suppliers

40:28.664 --> 40:29.810
and pay for each towed car.

40:30.010 --> 40:32.268
The system took advantage of that.
Stop! Shit!

40:32.468 --> 40:34.609
Each Captain gets his own tow truck

40:34.809 --> 40:36.294
and tows everybody.

40:36.494 --> 40:37.774
What the hell?
You can't do it here!

40:37.974 --> 40:40.829
Captain Oliveira runs this tow truck.

40:41.029 --> 40:43.156
I got him in the line,
it's your business anyway.

40:43.356 --> 40:45.767
Oliveira...
Tell him about my parts!!

40:45.967 --> 40:46.768
Hello!

40:46.968 --> 40:47.769
Hello!

40:47.969 --> 40:49.918
Oliveira, Captain Fabio speaking.

40:50.118 --> 40:52.194
I'm at the car repairs
to get my money.

40:52.394 --> 40:54.604
You leave this here!
Colonel, Fabio on the call.

40:54.804 --> 40:58.034
He's messing up our 'tow truck deal'.

40:59.070 --> 41:02.259
Cut his wings off!
Get out of there now.

41:02.459 --> 41:03.631
I call the shots there!

41:03.831 --> 41:06.837
I run that shit!

41:07.037 --> 41:09.037
Alright.
Tell about my parts!

41:09.237 --> 41:11.128
Hold on!! Fuck sake!
Hello, hello!

41:11.328 --> 41:12.709
That asshole hung up on me.

41:12.909 --> 41:15.651
How about the parts, fuck sake!

41:15.851 --> 41:17.851
Dunno, dunno!

41:20.752 --> 41:23.277
Hey, Capt. Hey, Beatle!

41:23.477 --> 41:25.584
There's another Chief.

41:25.784 --> 41:28.305
Friday, the biker comes down to
collect the money of the 'deal'.

41:28.505 --> 41:30.903
I told you, that the Chief's
bike cannot go dead,

41:31.103 --> 41:32.075
otherwise they can't collect the 'arrego'.

41:32.275 --> 41:33.594
Jesus sake, now I'm getting
the fuckin point of that.

41:33.794 --> 41:37.526
Everybody used to share the money.

41:37.726 --> 41:39.229
Now, its only the Commander and his Captain.
We are fucked up!

41:39.429 --> 41:40.356
The system has no limits.

41:40.556 --> 41:41.665
It has no borders.

41:41.865 --> 41:43.457
And it's already part of the
PD culture.

41:43.657 --> 41:45.820
This Commander has been
fucking everybody up.

41:46.020 --> 41:46.800
Even you, Paulo?

41:47.000 --> 41:47.801
Sgt.

41:48.001 --> 41:51.362
Since last year I've been trying
to get my holidays for next month.

41:51.562 --> 41:54.440
And my wife finally got her
holidays from the mayor.

41:54.640 --> 41:56.343
She's gonna take holidays
with me next month.

41:56.543 --> 41:57.491
Very good!

41:57.691 --> 42:03.130
So, I would like to ask you, Sir, to publish
the bulletin to permit my holidays.

42:03.330 --> 42:05.072
Well, in fact, soldier,

42:05.272 --> 42:08.464
it will be hard to publish it 'cause
I got 40 people in a queue.

42:08.664 --> 42:12.751
8 on holidays and the Battalion cannot remain
with a short number of contingent.

42:12.951 --> 42:15.680
But, well, I have a special
deal from the major.

42:15.880 --> 42:18.260
And we can fix that, right?

42:18.438 --> 42:20.154
'Cuz we are very strict.

42:20.354 --> 42:21.155
Did you get it?

42:21.355 --> 42:24.051
Sgt. Rocha, what I am asking

42:24.251 --> 42:26.099
is my right, I haven't had holidays
since four years ago, Sgt.

42:26.299 --> 42:28.445
You only need to publish what
we had already dealt.

42:28.645 --> 42:32.121
I can even help you.
I'm gonna help you, I want to help you

42:32.321 --> 42:35.880
but, you must help me to help you!

42:37.421 --> 42:43.371
Soldier Paulo, in order to give some smiles,
you must make the smiles.

42:44.609 --> 42:46.310
Did you get Antonio?
Do you understand?

42:46.510 --> 42:47.576
You must make smiles.

42:47.776 --> 42:50.816
I got it, Sgt.
Yes, I got, Sir!

42:51.016 --> 42:55.957
Permission to leave, Sgt.
Permission granted, Soldier.

43:06.935 --> 43:08.105
Sir, I don't know nothing about cars

43:08.305 --> 43:09.974
Could you replace me to slums operations?

43:10.174 --> 43:12.368
You've just joined the Battalion and
want to move already?

43:12.568 --> 43:15.511
I don't want to move.
I want to help for real!

43:15.711 --> 43:16.512
I am a good shooter.

43:16.712 --> 43:19.433
Well, rookie,
if you make 70% of those vehicle working

43:19.633 --> 43:22.933
properly I can think
about your order.

43:23.133 --> 43:23.934
Right?

43:24.134 --> 43:26.262
But Sir, I...
Dismissed.

43:26.462 --> 43:29.352
The system makes
the cops go nuts.

43:29.478 --> 43:33.564
And unfortunately BOPE
is not different on this.

43:35.658 --> 43:39.058
Hey darling, are you
climbing up or not?

43:39.389 --> 43:40.430
Darling, are you OK?

43:40.630 --> 43:42.630
Are you feeling sick?

43:46.808 --> 43:48.845
Beto!

43:55.476 --> 43:57.476
Beto!

43:57.953 --> 43:58.981
Are you alright?

43:59.181 --> 43:59.982
Uh-huh.

44:00.182 --> 44:02.182
I'm fine!

44:02.485 --> 44:04.485
Are you sure?
Uh-huh.

44:11.476 --> 44:14.050
Holy Shit, I'm feeling fuckin' sick.

44:14.250 --> 44:17.008
Relax, darling.
It's nothing to do with heart.

44:17.208 --> 44:19.208
I can't feel my arms.

44:19.321 --> 44:21.786
It's just stress.
Believe me.

44:29.503 --> 44:31.129
Nascimento, you check out 100% ok!

44:31.329 --> 44:33.499
Check that shit again, Dr. Madeira.

44:33.699 --> 44:35.754
Everything was checked.
All my relatives are

44:35.954 --> 44:36.755
prone to heart attack.

44:36.955 --> 44:39.675
My father died by heart attack.

44:39.869 --> 44:42.504
Buddy, you have an iron heart.

44:44.104 --> 44:45.426
When I'm in silence,
I hear a noise.

44:45.626 --> 44:48.798
My hands are shaking...
Your problem is emotional.

44:48.998 --> 44:52.652
It's not physical.
What do you mean?

44:52.852 --> 44:56.607
You are facing chronic stress.

44:56.807 --> 45:00.377
I'm gonna forward
you to the psychiatrist.

45:00.571 --> 45:01.919
Psychiatrist? What the fuck?

45:02.119 --> 45:03.295
It won't hurt, buddy!

45:03.495 --> 45:06.250
In PD he who is honest
always gets fucked up.

45:06.450 --> 45:07.251
Someway, somehow.

45:07.451 --> 45:09.661
Matias had worked two months

45:09.981 --> 45:11.853
to do the criminal check
of the neighborhood.

45:12.053 --> 45:15.778
He took the occurrences
and did a map of the murders.

45:15.978 --> 45:16.824
Finished, Chief.

45:17.024 --> 45:18.468
If the Chief
put the right vehicles,

45:18.668 --> 45:20.108
in the right places,

45:20.308 --> 45:22.317
everybody would be protected.

45:22.517 --> 45:23.318
Uno, 435 in Tabajara.

45:23.518 --> 45:27.400
But that is not the way that
the PD works.

45:30.397 --> 45:31.986
The PD is the system and the system

45:32.186 --> 45:37.291
doesn't work to fix the
problems of the society.

45:37.781 --> 45:39.207
The system works to fix the problems

45:39.407 --> 45:40.208
of the system.

45:40.408 --> 45:42.536
Fuck sake, Estevao
this report will fuck me.

45:42.736 --> 45:46.486
12 murderers, how can I hand this
to the Command?

45:46.686 --> 45:48.038
Colonel, I checked the job of the

45:48.238 --> 45:49.638
rookie and it seems all right.

45:49.838 --> 45:51.935
Rookie, do you wanna fuck me?

45:52.135 --> 45:55.872
No, Sir!
Call Fabio now! Hurry up!

45:58.347 --> 46:00.350
He'd better explain to me about

46:00.550 --> 46:02.654
these four bodies found in Tabajara.
Col., that report is based

46:02.854 --> 46:05.120
in statistics.
Fuck statistics!

46:05.320 --> 46:08.025
This guy wants to show me where
to put my patrols.

46:08.225 --> 46:12.612
Every time there's a crime in the Battalion area
the responsible must be charged for that.

46:12.812 --> 46:15.452
But to seek the murderers is a pain the ass.

46:15.652 --> 46:17.538
Sir, did you call me?
Yes.

46:17.738 --> 46:19.405
What's the matter?

46:19.605 --> 46:20.406
Lots. I want to know what

46:20.606 --> 46:23.390
do these four bodies in Tabajara mean?

46:23.590 --> 46:24.416
It's not my fault!

46:24.616 --> 46:26.110
I did it all like you asked but...

46:26.310 --> 46:31.285
'Mare zero', no bodies left in area of
'mare uno nine'.

46:32.370 --> 46:34.614
The bodies, according to the information,
are aligned

46:34.814 --> 46:35.486
in 'mare-two'.

46:35.686 --> 46:39.153
It's easier to change the crime
scene than to seek the murderers.

46:39.353 --> 46:41.466
There's a lot of scumbags,
Chiefs that reduce the criminality

46:41.666 --> 46:45.746
by dropping the corpses
in other battalion areas.

46:46.184 --> 46:47.338
But in PD,

46:47.538 --> 46:48.339
nobody takes it easy.

46:48.539 --> 46:49.904
'Mare zero'. The bodies are placed

46:50.104 --> 46:53.450
in 'mare uno nine', roger that?

46:55.014 --> 46:56.888
But those assholes,
they catch the bodies

46:57.088 --> 46:59.108
and throw them back, I throw them out again,
and vice-versa.

46:59.308 --> 47:00.175
It's a 'grocery store war'.

47:00.375 --> 47:01.176
I don't give a shit.

47:01.376 --> 47:02.693
You must fix that.
But Sir!

47:02.893 --> 47:03.918
Finish!
Yes, Sir.

47:04.118 --> 47:04.919
Rookie.

47:05.119 --> 47:06.705
You gonna re-do that report.

47:06.905 --> 47:07.706
Look at that:

47:07.906 --> 47:09.575
'One body found in the beach.'

47:09.775 --> 47:11.907
the body found in the beach
is death by drowning!

47:12.107 --> 47:15.091
But, how about the perforation?
Are you a forensic expert?

47:15.291 --> 47:16.092
No, Sir.

47:16.292 --> 47:17.093
By Monday I want a new

47:17.293 --> 47:18.218
report here on my desk.

47:18.418 --> 47:21.015
'Cuz this one here,

47:21.215 --> 47:21.982
has never existed!

47:22.182 --> 47:24.182
Dismissed!

47:24.290 --> 47:25.371
Permission to leave, Sir.

47:25.571 --> 47:26.778
I also tried to modify the PD system.

47:26.978 --> 47:31.201
And my plans were also denied.

47:37.209 --> 47:39.580
If you don't say a word, it will be
hard to help.

47:39.780 --> 47:41.780
I know.

47:44.550 --> 47:47.006
'Cause it's hard to speak, you know.

47:47.206 --> 47:50.057
I'm not sure if

47:50.366 --> 47:55.624
all that I'm going to say to you
would be reported to my superiors.

47:55.824 --> 47:58.030
If it would, I'd rather speak

47:58.230 --> 48:00.230
about a friend of mine

48:00.395 --> 48:02.181
who is about to have a baby

48:02.381 --> 48:04.214
and is facing a situation.
Capt., in his job,

48:04.414 --> 48:09.606
I only answer your question
if I really know what's wrong.

48:11.124 --> 48:12.928
Besides that, this is not a
confessional.

48:13.128 --> 48:16.273
This is the PD psychiatrist's office.

48:19.714 --> 48:20.856
Can you imagine

48:21.056 --> 48:22.078
if I would have to report

48:22.278 --> 48:24.322
everything that I've heard here?

48:24.522 --> 48:27.752
There wouldn't be any officers in Rio.

48:29.039 --> 48:29.922
Well.

48:30.122 --> 48:33.522
It's up to you if you
wanna speak or not.

48:44.945 --> 48:46.106
Excuse me.

48:46.306 --> 48:47.107
Nascimento!

48:47.307 --> 48:51.302
As soon as I can I find someone
to replace you.

48:51.555 --> 48:52.753
Colonel
Captain.

48:52.953 --> 48:55.588
I need you in Pope's Operation.

48:57.341 --> 49:00.750
For me, mission assigned is
mission accomplished.

49:00.950 --> 49:02.674
Did you understand?

49:02.874 --> 49:03.675
Yes, Sir.

49:03.875 --> 49:05.875
You can leave.

49:07.810 --> 49:09.579
It was an irony of the fate.

49:09.779 --> 49:14.230
The same day that I was about to lose my hope
of quitting BOPE, it was the beginning of

49:14.430 --> 49:16.290
a story that would change
many people's lives.

49:16.490 --> 49:17.553
For better,

49:17.753 --> 49:19.753
Or worst.

49:28.656 --> 49:29.833
What's up Neto?

49:30.033 --> 49:31.095
About time!

49:31.295 --> 49:32.627
Do you have the car key?

49:32.827 --> 49:35.097
Damn it, are you kidding?

49:35.297 --> 49:36.034
You are messing the criminal report?

49:36.234 --> 49:38.352
I found out how I will quit that
repair shop.

49:38.552 --> 49:39.827
Come with me
and I will tell you the plan.

49:40.027 --> 49:42.067
Come on!
What you mean?

49:42.180 --> 49:44.220
Come with me!
Fuck sake

49:44.319 --> 49:46.319
You must be crazy.

49:52.927 --> 49:55.462
Because of that Chief
I've been fucked up in the station.

49:55.662 --> 49:56.883
What do you mean, Fabio?

49:57.083 --> 49:58.787
He cut my deal off, Matias.

49:58.987 --> 50:01.073
Not even the money from
this club do I have anymore.

50:01.273 --> 50:03.696
Look at him, that scumbag!

50:05.540 --> 50:07.557
So you were bribing here too?

50:07.757 --> 50:08.558
Well,

50:08.758 --> 50:11.265
I earn 500 in a month.
Do you think that I'll keep

50:11.465 --> 50:12.539
going to the slums to be killed
for 500?

50:12.739 --> 50:14.949
What's the deal??

50:15.100 --> 50:16.672
Have you collected
money from this disco?

50:16.872 --> 50:20.417
We played fair!

50:20.617 --> 50:23.829
The only scumbag is the Chief
who used to go up

50:24.029 --> 50:25.664
the hills to charge the Hood.

50:25.864 --> 50:27.952
Are you kidding?
Is he bribing too?

50:28.152 --> 50:29.708
You are too naive!

50:29.908 --> 50:30.709
Haven't you noticed that

50:30.909 --> 50:33.249
only the Chief's team goes every
week to the hills?

50:33.449 --> 50:34.511
Do you think he does
something for free?

50:34.711 --> 50:36.331
He goes for the
money of the traffic.

50:36.531 --> 50:37.739
How much is he making for that?

50:37.939 --> 50:39.740
6 bucks a week.
During my time.

50:39.940 --> 50:41.231
Nowadays must be much more.

50:41.431 --> 50:44.285
6 bucks a week! Fuck sake!
That's loads of money!

50:44.485 --> 50:46.476
That scumbag is making lots of money.

50:46.676 --> 50:47.559
I got a plan for us.

50:47.759 --> 50:49.560
How much will I earn with it?

50:49.760 --> 50:54.010
What do you mean?
What? You really think that you

50:54.150 --> 50:55.757
gonna keep that money for you?

50:55.957 --> 50:57.349
No, no way.
I'm gonna use this money

50:57.549 --> 50:59.344
to buy the parts for the vehicles

50:59.544 --> 51:02.326
because I want to
change to another station.

51:02.526 --> 51:03.755
And how much will you pay to me?

51:03.955 --> 51:06.708
Don't you want to fuck the Colonel?

51:06.908 --> 51:09.072
What?
You want to mess with me!

51:09.272 --> 51:10.895
You know what?
I'm gonna pee, see ya!

51:11.095 --> 51:13.096
You are joking!
What's the matter, Fabio?

51:13.296 --> 51:15.870
You stay there! I'm leaving.
Hey, hold on!

51:16.070 --> 51:16.871
Fuck!

51:17.071 --> 51:20.301
You are not going to give up,
are you?

51:22.568 --> 51:24.568
Are you?

51:26.759 --> 51:28.631
I have to confess that Neto's idea

51:28.831 --> 51:32.851
made all the honest
officers feel better.

51:33.051 --> 51:34.348
It was 100% calculated,

51:34.548 --> 51:36.147
It would take about 40 minutes

51:36.347 --> 51:37.931
for Matias to collect
the money from the mafia.

51:38.131 --> 51:41.276
The biggest deal
of the sucker Major.

51:41.663 --> 51:42.794
That was the Neto's job.

51:42.994 --> 51:44.156
So, what's up, Tiao?

51:44.356 --> 51:45.275
Give a start to see if it works now.

51:45.475 --> 51:46.434
Hurry up, 'cause I'm late.

51:46.634 --> 51:47.435
Ok, Lieutenant

51:47.635 --> 51:48.436
He's late, huh.

51:48.636 --> 51:49.437
Soon, I'll be in trouble here.

51:49.637 --> 51:53.241
You want children's play?
Try to drink water upside down.

51:53.441 --> 51:54.152
Capt. is a sucker!

51:54.352 --> 51:55.539
It will work, this time.

51:55.739 --> 51:56.540
Will?

51:56.740 --> 52:00.318
It was supposed to be
on the streets already, Tiao.

52:00.518 --> 52:02.518
One touch!

52:10.907 --> 52:14.340
It's broken again!
Call Paulo! Hurry!

52:15.534 --> 52:17.843
When Neto started the engine,

52:18.043 --> 52:19.158
Matias has already
collected the money.

52:19.358 --> 52:21.358
That's my boy!

52:21.851 --> 52:23.364
Whas' up, Santos?
Whas' up?

52:23.564 --> 52:26.147
Are you better?

52:26.347 --> 52:27.257
Well, your buddy has come and

52:27.457 --> 52:28.258
he said that you were sick.

52:28.458 --> 52:29.259
Me? Sick?

52:29.459 --> 52:31.644
Yes, I just gave him the money.

52:31.844 --> 52:33.103
Who's that?

52:33.303 --> 52:37.375
Your mate dropped here in order of the Colonel.
I just gave him the money.

52:37.575 --> 52:40.144
Holy shit!
Fuckin Bastard!

52:40.344 --> 52:41.145
Come here now!
Come on!

52:41.345 --> 52:45.969
What will the Colonel could do?
Call the Police?

52:46.169 --> 52:46.970
I don't know.

52:47.170 --> 52:50.779
Neto used the system against the system.

52:53.927 --> 52:55.468
It was a brilliant idea,
but also very dumb.

52:55.668 --> 52:57.079
Now we got 10 vehicles working, Matias!

52:57.279 --> 53:00.254
The system would charge it's money.

53:00.948 --> 53:02.356
But at least,
he tried to fill the cracks in.

53:02.556 --> 53:06.309
Matias was counting on mistakes.

53:06.509 --> 53:08.978
I got stuff to do.

53:09.178 --> 53:09.979
I gotta go too!

53:10.179 --> 53:12.179
Bye
Bye!

53:19.412 --> 53:20.533
Hey, long time no see!

53:20.733 --> 53:22.733
How are you?
Fine.

53:45.987 --> 53:47.987
Hey.

53:50.043 --> 53:51.063
Try this one.

53:51.263 --> 53:53.303
Look who is showing up!

53:56.263 --> 53:58.898
I can't believe it. We're fucked!

54:00.648 --> 54:02.275
What's up!
Hooray for Maria!

54:02.475 --> 54:04.475
How are you?

54:06.361 --> 54:09.846
We were out there.
Chatting and drinking.

54:11.717 --> 54:13.552
Will you stay quiet here?

54:13.752 --> 54:15.752
We are just drinking.

54:17.693 --> 54:18.684
I'm gonna dance now.

54:18.884 --> 54:19.685
See you!

54:19.885 --> 54:21.885
Bye!

54:25.394 --> 54:29.814
Only because we own
'fine apartments in south zone.'

54:30.208 --> 54:31.169
Hey, check that,
I'm gonna

54:31.369 --> 54:32.170
joke with that bastard.

54:32.370 --> 54:34.370
Don't start a mess!

55:04.271 --> 55:06.944
(Cops are only for those who need them!)
They want to joke with me.

55:07.144 --> 55:11.649
(Cops are only for those who need them!)
Don't worry.

55:13.879 --> 55:15.497
(they ask you to obey!)

55:15.697 --> 55:18.059
(they ask you to answer!)

55:18.259 --> 55:20.554
(they ask you to cooperate)

55:20.716 --> 55:22.931
(they ask you to respect)

55:23.212 --> 55:29.222
(Cops are only for those who need them!)

55:34.325 --> 55:35.443
More potatoes.

55:35.643 --> 55:37.643
Yes.

55:37.944 --> 55:41.259
In PD, the system protects the corrupt.

55:42.028 --> 55:43.868
The Colonel couldn't complain about the

55:44.068 --> 55:44.869
stolen bribe money.

55:45.069 --> 55:47.069
But he could get even.

55:47.332 --> 55:48.655
Matias became Cook.

55:48.855 --> 55:51.517
Neto fixed the vehicles but
stayed in the car repairs.

55:51.717 --> 55:53.416
Paulo, why you are here?

55:53.616 --> 55:55.121
I'm on my 'holidays' Lieutenant

55:55.321 --> 55:57.265
This is for the one
who makes complaints.

55:57.465 --> 56:00.109
How about the repairs?

56:00.309 --> 56:01.110
And lost a mechanic.
Tiao!

56:01.310 --> 56:03.435
Do you wanna fruit salad?

56:04.715 --> 56:06.260
I told you this wouldn't

56:06.460 --> 56:07.261
finish good.

56:07.461 --> 56:13.071
Fortunately the Colonel thought that they
were only obeying orders.

56:13.726 --> 56:15.841
Orders of someone who knew
the system very well.

56:16.041 --> 56:18.041
Fabio!
Yes, sir.

56:20.442 --> 56:23.849
I want you to check out a rock concert

56:24.049 --> 56:24.850
in the Babilonia slums.

56:25.050 --> 56:25.987
Me, sir?
Yes.

56:26.187 --> 56:26.988
Alright, sir!

56:27.188 --> 56:27.989
Tonight!
Tonight?!

56:28.189 --> 56:29.936
Dismissed!
As you wish.

56:30.136 --> 56:31.326
Excuse me.

56:31.526 --> 56:33.758
For him,
the punishment would be much worst.

56:33.958 --> 56:36.610
That was the point that
Matias' and Neto's story

56:36.810 --> 56:39.408
began to link with my story.

56:46.743 --> 56:47.268
Darling.

56:47.468 --> 56:48.478
It's moving a lot!

56:48.678 --> 56:49.607
It looks like an ET,

56:49.807 --> 56:51.363
but it's the most beautiful
thing in the world.

56:51.563 --> 56:53.773
Too bad you are not here.

56:54.170 --> 56:56.598
Hey, listen to that.

57:01.915 --> 57:04.151
Every time I thought about my son,

57:04.351 --> 57:07.071
I remembered the look-out's mom.

57:07.979 --> 57:12.144
It might be very painful
to bury your own son.

57:27.292 --> 57:29.292
Big Mouth!

57:29.801 --> 57:31.066
Get ready 'cause we will leave.

57:31.266 --> 57:33.901
Where are we going?
To Turano.

57:34.608 --> 57:38.008
We gonna search for
the look-out's body.

57:41.876 --> 57:44.235
Hey guys, Colonel asked me

57:44.435 --> 57:45.410
to investigate a rock concert.

57:45.610 --> 57:46.411
That slum is a joy to come tonight,

57:46.611 --> 57:48.579
if we do the right thing we can deal,

57:48.779 --> 57:49.580
but if the Colonel knows that...

57:49.780 --> 57:55.459
What the fuck? Why that gun?

57:55.659 --> 57:56.656
God sake.

57:56.856 --> 57:57.839
Don't fuck with me up there.

57:58.039 --> 57:58.840
Don't mess...

57:59.040 --> 57:59.841
Trust me, relax!

58:00.041 --> 58:00.842
Capt., are you ready for the...

58:01.042 --> 58:01.843
Colonel asked me to come on this.

58:02.043 --> 58:08.078
No, no. You are coming with me.

58:08.278 --> 58:09.180
You, leave that gun and look after

58:09.380 --> 58:12.610
the Colonel's bike. Come on! Hurry up.

58:14.776 --> 58:16.559
Neto, did you steal the money of the mafia?

58:16.759 --> 58:17.560
Yes, sir.

58:17.760 --> 58:18.561
Come on Captain.

58:18.761 --> 58:20.761
Time for the show.

58:24.175 --> 58:26.175
They're gonna kill me.

58:41.956 --> 58:43.061
Matias, we are fucked up!
Follow me.

58:43.261 --> 58:44.062
What's wrong?

58:44.262 --> 58:45.440
They think it was Fabio.

58:45.640 --> 58:46.441
Hurry up!

58:46.641 --> 58:48.641
Take care of this.

58:58.999 --> 59:00.999
In God we trust!
DJ!

59:02.654 --> 59:03.280
Come on!

59:03.480 --> 59:04.281
Which way?

59:04.481 --> 59:06.481
Come on! come on!

59:30.126 --> 59:32.126
Lay down!

59:32.231 --> 59:32.936
Hold on!
Hold on!

59:33.136 --> 59:33.937
What can you see?

59:34.137 --> 59:36.137
Hold on!

59:37.732 --> 59:38.556
We don't need that tonight!

59:38.756 --> 59:39.812
The slum is quiet.
What the fuck?

59:40.012 --> 59:40.813
Move, move!

59:41.013 --> 59:42.605
Can you see Fabio?

59:42.805 --> 59:43.665
Hold on!

59:43.865 --> 59:44.666
I deal with that!

59:44.866 --> 59:47.640
Hold on!
What can you see?

59:50.705 --> 59:52.044
What's up, Oliveira!

59:52.244 --> 59:53.045
Once again!

59:53.245 --> 59:55.708
Where is the stuff?

01:00:10.925 --> 01:00:11.847
Who did you shoot, guy?

01:00:12.047 --> 01:00:12.848
Come on! Move it!

01:00:13.048 --> 01:00:13.849
Move it!

01:00:14.049 --> 01:00:16.049
Fuck! Damn it!

01:01:07.039 --> 01:01:08.347
You son of a bitch!

01:01:08.547 --> 01:01:10.757
Pull the fuckin' trigger!

01:01:14.315 --> 01:01:16.315
I got only one bullet!

01:01:19.814 --> 01:01:20.683
It's out of service.

01:01:20.883 --> 01:01:24.453
Leave a message, Capt.!
Fuck you, asshole!

01:01:25.845 --> 01:01:26.452
Deputy

01:01:26.652 --> 01:01:28.621
It will be my pleasure to support you.

01:01:28.821 --> 01:01:29.622
But, if Cabral is elected

01:01:29.822 --> 01:01:33.283
we will get a new battalion.
Much better.

01:01:33.483 --> 01:01:34.284
How much you pay me?

01:01:34.484 --> 01:01:36.694
Give me a second, please.

01:01:39.958 --> 01:01:41.232
Hey Colonel.
Capt. Oliveira!

01:01:41.432 --> 01:01:43.291
Colonel call the BOPE!
Call the BOPE!

01:01:43.491 --> 01:01:44.292
What?

01:01:44.492 --> 01:01:45.293
Captain!
Captain!

01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:48.398
There's a team surrounded in Babilonia
It seems that there's an injured cop.

01:01:48.598 --> 01:01:49.399
Nobody is in HQ.

01:01:49.599 --> 01:01:50.400
Everybody is on Turano.

01:01:50.600 --> 01:01:51.401
So, what's the deal?

01:01:51.601 --> 01:01:53.601
Fuck sake!

01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:10.185
Nobody is in a hurry here!

01:02:10.385 --> 01:02:12.234
I can stay the whole night.

01:02:12.434 --> 01:02:14.923
Where's the body of the look-out boy?

01:02:15.123 --> 01:02:16.137
I don't know anything.

01:02:16.337 --> 01:02:18.702
What? How could you?
We caught you with guns,

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:22.308
and you don't know where the kid's body is?
I'm not a dealer, dunno!

01:02:22.508 --> 01:02:25.143
So face the plastic bag again!

01:02:35.166 --> 01:02:35.998
(Mare 'zero-nine' speaking)!

01:02:36.198 --> 01:02:38.705
He fainted, Capt.
Wake him up, throw some water!

01:02:38.905 --> 01:02:40.153
Wake up, asshole!

01:02:40.353 --> 01:02:44.433
Zero-one, priority in Babilonia
cops surrounded.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:47.681
Copy that, Carvalho!

01:02:47.881 --> 01:02:48.856
We are heading there!

01:02:49.056 --> 01:02:49.912
Fuck, the guys make shits and

01:02:50.112 --> 01:02:50.913
we have to fix it!

01:02:51.113 --> 01:02:51.914
Head to Babilonia!

01:02:52.114 --> 01:02:54.600
How about that 'worm'?
Put in 'Pope's tab'!

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:57.767
Turn around!
You bastard!

01:03:09.364 --> 01:03:10.089
We're gonna die!

01:03:10.289 --> 01:03:12.289
Fuck sake!

01:03:18.266 --> 01:03:21.581
They are shooting at the fellas there.

01:03:36.874 --> 01:03:40.854
Behave yourself
and stay here!

01:03:49.122 --> 01:03:51.122
Change the magazine!

01:03:52.584 --> 01:03:54.584
We gonna fuck them!

01:03:56.981 --> 01:03:58.981
Shoot motherfucker!

01:04:02.003 --> 01:04:04.003
We're gonna die!

01:04:06.975 --> 01:04:08.975
I'm low on ammo!

01:04:42.647 --> 01:04:44.647
Shit!

01:04:55.046 --> 01:04:57.086
My ammo has gone, Neto!

01:04:59.426 --> 01:05:00.484
MPD! MPD!

01:05:00.684 --> 01:05:01.485
MPD! MPD!

01:05:01.685 --> 01:05:04.285
To the ground!

01:05:11.669 --> 01:05:14.304
Get out of the hole!
Get down!

01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:20.710
Zero-one!
Look after the two fellas.

01:05:23.073 --> 01:05:25.453
Big Mouth, look who's here!

01:05:26.005 --> 01:05:27.454
Zero one!
This is Marcinho, the boss of the slum.

01:05:27.654 --> 01:05:28.455
Let's take him down.

01:05:28.655 --> 01:05:29.947
Are you OK?
Yes, Sir!

01:05:30.147 --> 01:05:32.549
Is anyone injured?
No, Sir!

01:05:32.749 --> 01:05:34.930
Anyone shot?
No, Sir!

01:05:35.130 --> 01:05:37.638
So, tonight you gonna learn
how to carry bodies.

01:05:37.838 --> 01:05:39.838
Yes, sir.

01:05:40.109 --> 01:05:42.319
What are you waiting for?

01:05:44.613 --> 01:05:45.879
Come on!

01:05:46.079 --> 01:05:48.079
Hold a minute!

01:05:48.652 --> 01:05:49.597
Hi darling.

01:05:49.797 --> 01:05:50.598
Did it blow up?

01:05:50.798 --> 01:05:52.798
Are you sure?

01:05:54.335 --> 01:05:57.310
Calm down,
remember what they said?

01:05:57.585 --> 01:05:58.574
We can make it, ok!

01:05:58.774 --> 01:05:59.575
I'm coming now!

01:05:59.775 --> 01:06:01.507
And catch you there!
Alright?

01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:02.508
Bye!

01:06:02.708 --> 01:06:03.538
Zero-two!

01:06:03.738 --> 01:06:05.397
Go ahead, Zero-one!

01:06:05.597 --> 01:06:07.632
Take control of the occurrence.

01:06:07.832 --> 01:06:11.402
Take the big boss
'cause my son will be born.

01:06:14.876 --> 01:06:16.596
Congrats!!
Come on, come on!

01:06:16.796 --> 01:06:18.836
Come on, take the body!

01:06:20.932 --> 01:06:22.932
Come on! Come on!

01:06:27.009 --> 01:06:29.431
Neto decided to join BOPE
'cause he loved fighting.

01:06:29.631 --> 01:06:33.488
His dream was to fight against
the crime in Rio's slums.

01:06:33.688 --> 01:06:35.788
He was watching our job very closely.

01:06:35.988 --> 01:06:40.153
Matias would join too
'cause he believed in the law.

01:06:44.644 --> 01:06:45.887
Wait! Wait!

01:06:46.087 --> 01:06:47.488
If you weren't here

01:06:47.688 --> 01:06:50.488
I would be killed by those guys.

01:06:50.990 --> 01:06:51.891
The BOPE brought your gun!

01:06:52.091 --> 01:06:53.793
Help them to carry the body!

01:06:53.993 --> 01:06:55.993
What the hell is that?

01:06:59.294 --> 01:07:02.021
Get out of here!

01:07:02.221 --> 01:07:04.221
Sgt.
Go ahead!

01:07:05.622 --> 01:07:07.832
How can I join your team?

01:07:09.308 --> 01:07:10.480
Apply for the exam.

01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:13.995
What exam?
The one in the PD bulletin.

01:07:15.274 --> 01:07:16.261
Neto knew what he was doing.

01:07:16.461 --> 01:07:18.461
Matias didn't.

01:07:35.352 --> 01:07:37.381
Carvalho, beware about that.

01:07:37.581 --> 01:07:38.382
Colonel!
At ease.

01:07:38.582 --> 01:07:41.132
Sorry to be late.
No problem.

01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:44.390
Tell me.

01:07:45.122 --> 01:07:46.315
Is it a baby boy or a baby girl?
Boy.

01:07:46.515 --> 01:07:48.140
Raphael.

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:49.467
What is that, Renan?

01:07:49.667 --> 01:07:51.306
This is conjunctivitis.

01:07:51.506 --> 01:07:53.143
That's fuckin awful.

01:07:53.343 --> 01:07:54.669
Put those glasses on.

01:07:54.869 --> 01:07:56.629
May I have your attention.

01:07:56.829 --> 01:07:58.979
This is a voucher, but not for you.

01:07:59.179 --> 01:08:01.179
It's to Raphael.

01:08:01.375 --> 01:08:04.514
From that course two men will

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:06.714
replace you and you!

01:08:07.737 --> 01:08:08.657
Saint Raphael!

01:08:08.857 --> 01:08:09.658
Colonel

01:08:09.858 --> 01:08:13.187
I will coordinate the best course
in all history of the Squad.

01:08:13.387 --> 01:08:14.188
You can bet it!

01:08:14.388 --> 01:08:15.189
Good!

01:08:15.389 --> 01:08:16.189
Let's start now.

01:08:16.390 --> 01:08:20.368
This 'zero one' named Andre Pedrosa
He is in the mafia.

01:08:20.569 --> 01:08:22.077
Are you sure?
Absolutely.

01:08:22.277 --> 01:08:23.518
We have a good beginning.

01:08:23.718 --> 01:08:24.962
He's gonna become a number!

01:08:25.162 --> 01:08:27.725
Olavo Carvalho. Dodgy.

01:08:27.926 --> 01:08:31.718
That will turn Skull's gum.

01:08:31.917 --> 01:08:33.712
How about Fabio?
The Capt.?

01:08:33.912 --> 01:08:35.912
Yes!
Fabio Barbosa!

01:08:36.819 --> 01:08:37.854
He is a very dodgy guy!

01:08:38.055 --> 01:08:41.201
He's a pimp of the
whores from Copacabana.

01:08:41.401 --> 01:08:41.990
Renam!

01:08:42.189 --> 01:08:44.189
Can you see it?

01:08:46.127 --> 01:08:48.127
He looks like an owl.

01:08:48.894 --> 01:08:49.871
Batman!

01:08:50.071 --> 01:08:51.551
How about the rookie?

01:08:51.751 --> 01:08:53.709
These are the ones
you saved from the slum.

01:08:53.908 --> 01:08:56.252
Col. Estevao of the 19th
said that they are very good.

01:08:56.453 --> 01:08:58.453
Nice start.

01:08:58.566 --> 01:09:01.286
I don't want any burst eardrums

01:09:01.363 --> 01:09:05.189
in first class,
no guys with hands chopped off, ok?

01:09:05.389 --> 01:09:08.667
That was an accident.

01:09:09.648 --> 01:09:13.073
The rookie held the gun
and the instructor triggered.

01:09:13.274 --> 01:09:18.575
And the burst eardrum, Carvalho did...
It wasn't my proposal, Sir!

01:09:18.774 --> 01:09:19.830
Are you joking?

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:20.831
Without your proposal!

01:09:21.031 --> 01:09:23.326
That guy deserved it, Sir!

01:09:26.832 --> 01:09:31.163
Whoever wants to join BOPE cannot date
a dealer's friend.

01:09:31.363 --> 01:09:33.599
Matias was wavering.

01:09:34.666 --> 01:09:39.765
He wished to be an officer
but also to graduate as a lawyer.

01:09:41.585 --> 01:09:44.761
If Matias had the Police in his heart he
would tell the truth to his girlfriend.

01:09:44.962 --> 01:09:46.978
He just told her that
he was going travelling.

01:09:47.178 --> 01:09:48.691
And left her in trouble.

01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:51.861
He's been working for
us for almost one year.

01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:55.534
Great.
He fixed all of our problems.

01:09:55.734 --> 01:09:59.566
Right!
Andre had to travel.

01:09:59.766 --> 01:10:00.700
He's gonna spend two weeks out.

01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:03.343
Can we do for the next two weeks?

01:10:03.543 --> 01:10:08.975
In BOPE wavering is the same as
being useless.

01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:11.970
For me,
Matias would give up the rookie course.

01:10:12.170 --> 01:10:13.784
I just got a rookie job for Matias.

01:10:13.984 --> 01:10:15.966
You'd better look for another boyfriend!

01:10:16.166 --> 01:10:18.166
What's wrong?

01:10:19.187 --> 01:10:21.187
What's up Baiano?

01:10:22.781 --> 01:10:24.781
You must tell me!

01:10:26.242 --> 01:10:29.812
Can you recognize
someone on that picture?

01:10:30.985 --> 01:10:32.755
Is that your fuckin boyfriend?

01:10:32.955 --> 01:10:33.871
I can't believe it.

01:10:34.071 --> 01:10:35.509
What?

01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:40.743
This guy killed my friend.
A big dealer. You understand?

01:10:40.943 --> 01:10:43.240
So, what you gonna do?
Calm down!

01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:47.243
They don't have nothing to do with it.
I brought Andre Matias here.

01:10:47.443 --> 01:10:48.799
Absolutely.

01:10:48.999 --> 01:10:50.353
I just found that now.

01:10:50.553 --> 01:10:51.783
Nobody knew nothing.

01:10:51.983 --> 01:10:55.166
Are you fuckin pulling my leg?

01:10:55.693 --> 01:10:56.888
I'm gonna tell you once.

01:10:57.088 --> 01:10:59.298
MPD means 'enemy' for us.

01:10:59.490 --> 01:11:00.697
Outsiders.

01:11:00.897 --> 01:11:04.725
Nobody knew.
Shut up, 'cause I haven't finished yet.

01:11:04.925 --> 01:11:07.645
Who brings peace here?
The cops?

01:11:07.828 --> 01:11:08.611
Who the fuck?

01:11:08.811 --> 01:11:09.612
It's the gangsters.

01:11:09.812 --> 01:11:11.879
It's the gangsters

01:11:13.523 --> 01:11:14.712
And we are the gangsters

01:11:14.912 --> 01:11:16.491
And I'm the boss,
do you know what I'm saying?

01:11:16.691 --> 01:11:18.327
To work here,
you must deal with us.

01:11:18.527 --> 01:11:19.078
We do that!

01:11:19.278 --> 01:11:20.005
Which side are you, playboy?

01:11:20.205 --> 01:11:23.359
We make it!
We make it!

01:11:25.190 --> 01:11:27.105
I'm gonna keep eyes on you!

01:11:27.305 --> 01:11:29.873
Shut the fuck up!

01:11:30.073 --> 01:11:30.874
Calm down!

01:11:31.074 --> 01:11:31.875
Calm down.

01:11:32.075 --> 01:11:34.969
Keep eyes on him, Xaveco!
Calm down!

01:11:35.169 --> 01:11:35.970
Motherfucker!

01:11:36.170 --> 01:11:38.210
I will go to the point!

01:11:38.328 --> 01:11:41.430
If not, you gonna be in trouble, right?

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:44.095
And keep that news with you!

01:11:44.668 --> 01:11:46.668
Come on!

01:11:55.065 --> 01:11:57.800
When the rookie joined the BOPE,

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.635
the corrupt one has joined too.

01:12:00.742 --> 01:12:02.160
If Fabio kept working in the station,

01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.880
the Colonel would kill him.

01:12:05.485 --> 01:12:06.574
Poor guy.

01:12:06.774 --> 01:12:07.575
The guy didn't know that

01:12:07.775 --> 01:12:11.011
compared to me,
the Colonel was a lady.

01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:18.993
You have come here,

01:12:19.193 --> 01:12:21.635
by your own volition.

01:12:21.835 --> 01:12:22.848
Nobody,

01:12:23.048 --> 01:12:25.048
absolutely nobody,

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:27.552
has invited you.

01:12:27.752 --> 01:12:29.410
And none...

01:12:29.610 --> 01:12:30.411
and none of you

01:12:30.611 --> 01:12:32.611
is welcome here.

01:12:34.531 --> 01:12:36.631
You'd better take care of your souls,

01:12:36.831 --> 01:12:38.831
'Cause your bodies

01:12:38.936 --> 01:12:40.936
belong to us!

01:12:42.503 --> 01:12:43.358
I pronounce opened

01:12:43.558 --> 01:12:47.140
the Ninth Course of Special Operations.

01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:49.441
YOU WILL NEVER BE

01:12:58.335 --> 01:12:59.063
SKULLS!

01:12:59.263 --> 01:13:01.263
Attack!

01:13:06.452 --> 01:13:09.090
I recognize that for those who are beginners,

01:13:09.290 --> 01:13:11.135
BOPE looks more like a Sect.

01:13:11.335 --> 01:13:12.586
But it is exactly what they must be!

01:13:12.786 --> 01:13:14.786
Ask to go home!

01:13:17.823 --> 01:13:20.790
Our men become graduates by being beaten.

01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:25.920
To join, the guy must prove that
he can take the pressure.

01:13:26.049 --> 01:13:29.364
Ask to go back to your place!
No, Sir!

01:13:31.744 --> 01:13:34.379
Ask to come back home!
No sir!

01:13:35.591 --> 01:13:37.180
Do you think we don't know that

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:38.735
you collect money from the gangsters?

01:13:38.935 --> 01:13:42.232
Or that you deal with the mafia?

01:13:42.432 --> 01:13:45.075
Do you know why your codename is 'Zero-one'?

01:13:45.275 --> 01:13:48.976
Because you will be the first to give up!

01:13:49.176 --> 01:13:50.445
And I will force you to give up!

01:13:50.645 --> 01:13:51.446
Ask to quit!

01:13:51.646 --> 01:13:54.947
Ask to quit.

01:13:55.147 --> 01:13:56.846
Otherwise you're gonna quit under beatings.

01:13:57.046 --> 01:13:59.234
I give up!

01:14:01.107 --> 01:14:04.216
Zero-one gave up!

01:14:06.817 --> 01:14:08.585
From 100 cops who join the BOPEs course

01:14:08.785 --> 01:14:10.212
only 5 passes to the last module.

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:13.897
When I was the instructor, it was only 3.

01:14:14.043 --> 01:14:16.944
Israeli armies don't have soldiers like we do.

01:14:17.144 --> 01:14:20.029
BOPE GOT WARRIORS WHO KILL GUERRILLA FIGHTERS.

01:14:20.229 --> 01:14:23.262
WE KILL THEM ALL AND WE SMASH THEM ALL.

01:14:23.462 --> 01:14:30.646
KILLING, SMASHING, USING ALWAYS THE RIFLE.
BOPE HAVE WARRIORS WHO BELIEVE IN BRAZIL.

01:14:32.293 --> 01:14:36.217
To join the war against the gangsters,

01:14:36.417 --> 01:14:38.627
you must stand everything.

01:14:40.332 --> 01:14:42.670
The meaning of Strategy:

01:14:43.768 --> 01:14:46.418
In greek: Strategia.

01:14:47.844 --> 01:14:48.825
In latin:

In french:

01:14:53.782 --> 01:14:55.418
Strategie.

01:14:55.618 --> 01:14:56.545
Are you taking the notes?

01:14:56.745 --> 01:14:57.546
Yes sir!

01:14:57.746 --> 01:15:00.483
I'm gonna request this on the exam.

01:15:00.683 --> 01:15:01.580
In english:

01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:03.780
Strategy.

01:15:04.485 --> 01:15:05.510
In german:

01:15:05.710 --> 01:15:07.710
Stratege.

01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:10.245
In Italian:

01:15:10.445 --> 01:15:12.445

01:15:13.277 --> 01:15:15.277
In Spanish:

01:15:15.457 --> 01:15:16.284
Strategia.

01:15:16.484 --> 01:15:17.285
Instructor!
Yes, sir!

01:15:17.485 --> 01:15:19.720
'Zero-five' is sleeping!

01:15:24.928 --> 01:15:25.837
'Zero-five'.

01:15:26.037 --> 01:15:28.037
Yes, Sir!
Please!

01:15:31.134 --> 01:15:34.016
'Zero five', if you drop this grenade off

01:15:34.216 --> 01:15:36.322
you will blow up everybody here.

01:15:36.522 --> 01:15:37.509
You will blow your mates up,

01:15:37.709 --> 01:15:39.817
you will blow my assistants up

01:15:40.017 --> 01:15:42.022
you will blow me up!

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:44.440
Are you going to sleep, 'Zero-five'?

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.441
No sir!

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.929
We all trust in you!

01:15:52.090 --> 01:15:56.767
Restarting the point.

01:16:04.522 --> 01:16:06.522
In greek:

01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:08.833
Strategia

01:16:10.225 --> 01:16:11.044
In latin:

01:16:11.244 --> 01:16:13.244
Strategie.

01:16:14.867 --> 01:16:16.867
In french:

01:16:17.938 --> 01:16:18.734
Sgt..
Yes sir!

01:16:18.934 --> 01:16:21.991
Are you ready for lunch?
Yes sir.

01:16:22.191 --> 01:16:24.554
How long time you want for the lunch-break?

01:16:24.754 --> 01:16:27.134
Ten minutes is enough, Sir!

01:16:28.568 --> 01:16:29.618
Are you joking?

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:32.050
Sgt., you are a bozo!

01:16:33.664 --> 01:16:36.228
You all have 10 seconds for lunch!

01:16:36.428 --> 01:16:39.658
Nobody touches the meal before I say!

01:16:44.345 --> 01:16:46.345
When you finish,

01:16:46.498 --> 01:16:48.708
I want the ground cleaned!

01:16:49.408 --> 01:16:50.483
Do you understand?

01:16:50.683 --> 01:16:51.484
YES, SIR!

01:16:51.684 --> 01:16:53.684
Go!

01:16:56.391 --> 01:16:57.385
3 seconds have gone by!

01:16:57.585 --> 01:17:01.108
'Zero-two' is not eating!

01:17:03.234 --> 01:17:05.359
Your time is over!
Over!

01:17:05.482 --> 01:17:07.514
Over!

01:17:10.178 --> 01:17:13.044
What is that meal left on the ground?

01:17:13.244 --> 01:17:13.981
We didn't have time, Sir!

01:17:14.181 --> 01:17:15.709
Do you think it's fair,

01:17:15.909 --> 01:17:17.092
in a country like Brazil, where

01:17:17.292 --> 01:17:18.871
people are starving.

01:17:19.071 --> 01:17:21.337
'Zero-six'? You wasted this food

01:17:21.537 --> 01:17:23.903
'cause you are fussing, 'Zero-six'?

01:17:24.103 --> 01:17:24.904
No, Sir!

01:17:25.104 --> 01:17:27.824
Why you didn't eat, 'Zero-two'?

01:17:27.975 --> 01:17:29.428
Capt., I couldn't see it.

01:17:29.628 --> 01:17:31.923
How about now, 'Zero-two'?

01:17:32.922 --> 01:17:33.881
I see, sir.

01:17:34.081 --> 01:17:35.732
So, get down on your knees

01:17:35.932 --> 01:17:37.932
and eat this. Now!

01:17:40.442 --> 01:17:42.034
I want you to eat

01:17:42.234 --> 01:17:44.367
the whole food! Roger that, 'Zero-two'?

01:17:44.567 --> 01:17:45.368
Stop fussing, 'Zero-two'!

01:17:45.568 --> 01:17:46.369
If you don't eat it all,

01:17:46.569 --> 01:17:49.629
your mates will pass the whole night

01:17:49.798 --> 01:17:51.798
in the water.

01:17:53.412 --> 01:17:55.817
Are you feeling sick, 'Zero-two'?

01:17:56.017 --> 01:17:59.528
If you puke your food,

01:17:59.728 --> 01:18:02.363
your friends will eat that shit

01:18:02.531 --> 01:18:04.826
because of you, 'Zero-two'.

01:18:04.937 --> 01:18:05.923
No, I can eat it, sir!

01:18:06.123 --> 01:18:07.939
Everybody will eat this, now!

01:18:08.139 --> 01:18:08.940
Come on!

01:18:09.140 --> 01:18:11.645
You guys, swallow that shit!

01:18:11.845 --> 01:18:13.515
And it's all 'Zero-two' fault!

01:18:13.715 --> 01:18:16.095
I want that ground cleaned.

01:18:19.672 --> 01:18:20.810
Men in black, what do you do?

01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:23.159
WE DO THINGS THAT FRIGHTEN SATAN.

01:18:23.359 --> 01:18:25.829
Men in black, what's your mission?

01:18:26.029 --> 01:18:28.512
GO TO SLUMS AND LEAVE THE BODIES ON THE FLOOR.

01:18:28.712 --> 01:18:30.752
Attention!! Hold! Stop!

01:18:32.379 --> 01:18:33.738
Sgt.!

01:18:33.938 --> 01:18:37.055
This is the worst class
that I ever saw in my life.

01:18:37.255 --> 01:18:38.882
You must keep walking.

01:18:39.082 --> 01:18:43.589
You stop singing, but not walking!
I want you out of the water!

01:18:43.789 --> 01:18:47.451
The first module is all
about pressure!

01:18:47.651 --> 01:18:49.593
and the objective is to bury the weak,

01:18:49.793 --> 01:18:52.598
and furthermore,
the corrupt ones.

01:18:53.327 --> 01:18:54.654
and when it comes to me

01:18:54.854 --> 01:18:56.354
we fuck the corrupt first!

01:18:56.554 --> 01:18:58.192
Lent me that powder for him.

01:18:58.392 --> 01:19:00.392
Mine is gone.

01:19:01.876 --> 01:19:03.224
Zero-two!
Zero-two!

01:19:03.424 --> 01:19:03.870
zero two, wake up!
Take off those boots!

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:06.070
Look at your feet.

01:19:06.239 --> 01:19:10.210
No, I can't.
If I take my boots off I couldn't put it on again.

01:19:10.410 --> 01:19:13.758
Take your boots off!
You will fuck yourself.

01:19:13.958 --> 01:19:14.759
Your feet are wet.

01:19:14.959 --> 01:19:17.224
Take that shit off!

01:19:17.424 --> 01:19:19.424
Attention, zero-two!

01:19:20.086 --> 01:19:21.660
Zero-two I got news for you.

01:19:21.860 --> 01:19:22.512
Yes Sir!

01:19:22.712 --> 01:19:25.035
You are the new 'Sgt.'.

01:19:26.839 --> 01:19:30.790
You have one minute to put all them
in formation for the ceremony.

01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.791
Yes Sir!
Move, move!

01:19:31.991 --> 01:19:32.792
Hurry!

01:19:32.992 --> 01:19:34.992
Move, move!

01:19:41.799 --> 01:19:44.264
Fix that shit, you bastards!

01:19:46.373 --> 01:19:48.606
20 seconds have gone.

01:19:48.806 --> 01:19:50.633
Yes, sir!
Is the class ready?

01:19:50.833 --> 01:19:52.036
Yes!
Look behind you!

01:19:52.236 --> 01:19:53.267
Is the class ready?

01:19:53.467 --> 01:19:54.359
Class, Attention!

01:19:54.559 --> 01:19:55.360
Attention!

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:58.025
Is the class ready?
Yes sir!

01:19:58.135 --> 01:20:00.135
Are you sure?
Yes sir!

01:20:00.429 --> 01:20:01.751
Look at your untied laces.

01:20:01.951 --> 01:20:03.951
You bastard!

01:20:05.485 --> 01:20:07.485
You loser!

01:20:10.244 --> 01:20:12.244
Zero-two, follow me.

01:20:13.462 --> 01:20:15.462
Come on, move!

01:20:16.496 --> 01:20:17.475
Zero-two!
Yes, sir!

01:20:17.675 --> 01:20:19.283
Can you see the boat there?

01:20:19.483 --> 01:20:20.284
Yes sir!

01:20:20.484 --> 01:20:21.803
Can you see the boat there?

01:20:22.003 --> 01:20:23.905
Since you have your laces untied,

01:20:24.105 --> 01:20:25.961
you will go take the
equipment and bring the boat

01:20:26.161 --> 01:20:28.161
to the shore.
Yes sir!

01:20:29.696 --> 01:20:32.535
Do you think you are able to do it?
Yes Sir!

01:20:32.735 --> 01:20:33.565
Zero-two

01:20:33.765 --> 01:20:36.871
Do you know why you are not able to do it?
Yes, sir.

01:20:37.071 --> 01:20:39.401
It's not because you are a loser.

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:42.214
You won't be able

01:20:42.414 --> 01:20:43.768
because to have that Skull

01:20:43.968 --> 01:20:45.983
you need integrity.

01:20:47.733 --> 01:20:49.659
Something that you don't have.

01:20:49.859 --> 01:20:51.489
Your business is with whores.

01:20:51.689 --> 01:20:53.381
Your place is with pimps.

01:20:53.581 --> 01:20:56.556
Your place is in abortion clinics.

01:20:57.724 --> 01:21:00.334
We don't like corrupt cops!

01:21:01.814 --> 01:21:04.364
No corrupts can join the BOPE.

01:21:06.297 --> 01:21:09.002
Are you going to take the boat?
Yes, sir.

01:21:09.202 --> 01:21:11.577
Let's see if you will be able so!

01:21:11.777 --> 01:21:13.777
Look forward!

01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:17.435
Quit, you are a loser!

01:21:17.635 --> 01:21:18.800
Ask to quit.

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000
You won't make it!

01:21:22.126 --> 01:21:24.166
Ask to quit! You loser!

01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:25.823
I...cant...take it...anymore.

01:21:26.023 --> 01:21:28.323
Say it again.

01:21:29.773 --> 01:21:31.654
I can't stand it anymore

01:21:31.854 --> 01:21:32.621
I give up!

01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:33.622
Say it louder!

01:21:33.822 --> 01:21:36.078
So everybody can see how
much of a loser you are. Louder!

01:21:36.278 --> 01:21:38.278
I give up!

01:21:39.874 --> 01:21:40.605
You loser!

01:21:40.805 --> 01:21:41.606
Attention, class!

01:21:41.806 --> 01:21:43.806
At ease!

01:21:45.235 --> 01:21:47.348
Forward to rear guard.

01:21:47.929 --> 01:21:50.544
ELITE SQUAD.
No way!

01:21:50.744 --> 01:21:52.744
No way!

01:21:54.028 --> 01:21:56.028
Attention 'Twelve'.

01:21:57.276 --> 01:21:59.996
Yes, Sir!
You are the new Sgt..

01:22:01.691 --> 01:22:03.727
I give up, Sir!

01:22:07.048 --> 01:22:10.618
You are making your
instructor very happy!

01:22:11.638 --> 01:22:13.990
Thank you very much!

01:22:14.190 --> 01:22:16.835
Attention 'Zero-eight'!

01:22:35.464 --> 01:22:37.492
When the first module finished

01:22:37.692 --> 01:22:40.157
there was only 8 fellas left.

01:22:40.725 --> 01:22:44.295
It was about time
to pick my substitute up.

01:22:45.953 --> 01:22:48.503
Matias surprised me, he passed

01:22:48.622 --> 01:22:49.342
the first module.

01:22:49.542 --> 01:22:52.472
But made the mistake
to go back to the college.

01:22:52.672 --> 01:22:55.072
Maria!
Do you know who told me

01:22:55.272 --> 01:22:58.672
that you are a cop, Andre?
What's wrong?

01:22:58.838 --> 01:22:59.928
The big boss of the slum!

01:23:00.128 --> 01:23:01.149
Do you understand?

01:23:01.349 --> 01:23:02.513
Do you know the situation?

01:23:02.713 --> 01:23:05.549
Or for how long I've been trying
to work for the NGO?

01:23:05.749 --> 01:23:07.655
How much of myself I gave for that?

01:23:07.855 --> 01:23:08.939
Do you know?

01:23:09.139 --> 01:23:10.484
Calm down, Maria!

01:23:10.684 --> 01:23:13.287
What? You had no right to put
my life in risk!

01:23:13.487 --> 01:23:14.339
I was threatened!

01:23:14.539 --> 01:23:16.770
Listen, I was threatened.

01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:18.458
Can I talk?
You've put my life in risk.

01:23:18.658 --> 01:23:19.459
My friend's life...

01:23:19.659 --> 01:23:20.888
Let me talk.
No, I won't.

01:23:21.088 --> 01:23:22.393
I don't believe you anymore!

01:23:22.593 --> 01:23:25.304
Not so loud!

01:23:25.504 --> 01:23:27.789
You are an unreliable bastard!

01:23:27.989 --> 01:23:30.489
Unreliable scumbag!

01:23:33.965 --> 01:23:35.965
Maria!

01:23:40.680 --> 01:23:41.738
Tell me if I'm doing it right.

01:23:41.938 --> 01:23:44.646
We can not open too much!

01:23:45.989 --> 01:23:46.872
Not too much.

01:23:47.072 --> 01:23:49.407
To pick up a substitute for me
its not that easy.

01:23:49.607 --> 01:23:53.701
How is the course?
There's a guy really good.

01:23:55.214 --> 01:23:56.043
Very energetic.
Are you serious?

01:23:56.243 --> 01:23:59.620
He looks like me when I joined BOPE.

01:23:59.820 --> 01:24:01.823
It is not just to pick
the best of the class.

01:24:02.023 --> 01:24:06.463
He must do the work like I do.

01:24:06.663 --> 01:24:09.893
I couldn't quit without
making certain.

01:24:11.603 --> 01:24:15.055
I think he will be ready to replace
me in about one month.

01:24:15.255 --> 01:24:20.933
If Neto had the same intelligence as Matias,
my life might had been much easier.

01:24:21.133 --> 01:24:23.456
But who said that life is easy?

01:24:23.656 --> 01:24:25.951
Changing direction.
Target.

01:24:26.139 --> 01:24:27.594
On the second module of the course.
FIRE!

01:24:27.794 --> 01:24:31.357
We teach the guys how to kill
efficiently and with dignity.

01:24:31.557 --> 01:24:33.584
And believe me,
that is possible to do.

01:24:33.784 --> 01:24:34.585
Load holster.

01:24:34.785 --> 01:24:36.785
Good shot, 'Zero-six'.

01:24:36.939 --> 01:24:39.418
Standard. Of course its
much easier when you

01:24:39.618 --> 01:24:41.998
are using my rifle.
'Skull'.

01:24:42.431 --> 01:24:43.953
Come on, you four now!

01:24:44.153 --> 01:24:45.331
'Twenty-three'!

01:24:45.531 --> 01:24:47.521
Are you without your rifle strap?
Yes, Sir.

01:24:47.721 --> 01:24:50.905
Long time here and you
don't have your strap?

01:24:51.105 --> 01:24:54.203
If your mate is shot and falls on the ground,
what will you do?

01:24:54.403 --> 01:24:56.287
Would you drop your rifle?
No, Sir.

01:24:56.487 --> 01:24:58.412
Would you stick it in your ass?
No, sir.

01:24:58.612 --> 01:25:00.531
So, PUT ON THAT SHIT NOW!
Yes, Sir!

01:25:00.731 --> 01:25:01.532
Fuck sake!

01:25:01.732 --> 01:25:04.298
Twenty years training!

01:25:08.087 --> 01:25:11.291
Only the foreigners think that
slums are all the same.

01:25:11.491 --> 01:25:13.491
No way.

01:25:13.862 --> 01:25:16.396
Some slums you only go in
by climbing.

01:25:16.596 --> 01:25:19.656
Some others we go
through the jungle.

01:25:20.468 --> 01:25:22.419
Instructor, Azimuth 90 degrees, roger that?

01:25:22.619 --> 01:25:24.619
Ok, call the patrol.

01:25:43.706 --> 01:25:45.931
BOPE officers don't take in the slums
just shooting around it.

01:25:46.131 --> 01:25:47.627
They use strategy.

01:25:47.827 --> 01:25:49.851
Progressing alley by alley.
Move!

01:25:50.051 --> 01:25:52.158
Once you checked, keep going!

01:25:52.358 --> 01:25:53.621
Keep going!

01:25:53.821 --> 01:25:54.622
The focus is to twelve o'clock.

01:25:54.822 --> 01:25:59.072
Look forward, close your face,
keep the evil face.

01:26:00.193 --> 01:26:02.291
Once you checked the cover,
keep going.

01:26:02.491 --> 01:26:03.848
Look at me!

01:26:04.048 --> 01:26:06.513
Slow down, 'Zero-six'.
Slowly.

01:26:06.645 --> 01:26:07.377
Calm down!

01:26:07.577 --> 01:26:09.324
The progress in slums is an art.

01:26:09.524 --> 01:26:11.420
And to be Captain of BOPE,

01:26:11.620 --> 01:26:12.421
you must be an artist.

01:26:12.621 --> 01:26:14.928
Slice, and walk by.

01:26:15.128 --> 01:26:17.238
Excellent, 'zero-six'!
That is it, my boy.

01:26:17.438 --> 01:26:20.072
Slice and walk away.

01:26:21.267 --> 01:26:23.549
In my instruction I couldn't
allow any mistake.

01:26:23.749 --> 01:26:24.743
That's it!

01:26:24.943 --> 01:26:26.507
It's all about patience.

01:26:26.707 --> 01:26:27.808
Keep the form, wait!

01:26:28.008 --> 01:26:30.738
Is the cover there? Yes!

01:26:30.938 --> 01:26:34.446
No rush. Even if there's a war going on,
you must progress slowly.

01:26:34.646 --> 01:26:38.046
Look forward! Is the way free?
Go ahead.

01:26:38.732 --> 01:26:39.915
Go ahead!

01:26:40.115 --> 01:26:40.916
If it's free, just go!

01:26:41.116 --> 01:26:44.444
That is it, 'zero-six'. Standard,
that is it!

01:26:44.644 --> 01:26:48.894
Men in black uniforms only go to the slums
to kill.

01:26:49.933 --> 01:26:51.933
Never to die.

01:26:58.519 --> 01:27:02.344
The one that would replace me
must knew that.

01:27:04.664 --> 01:27:06.812
Captain.
Captain!

01:27:07.012 --> 01:27:08.365
'KT' ran away to the left.

01:27:08.565 --> 01:27:09.366
Was he alone?

01:27:09.566 --> 01:27:10.447
Yes, he was.

01:27:10.647 --> 01:27:11.867
I'll catch him.

01:27:12.067 --> 01:27:14.067
Hold on!!
Fuck Sake!

01:28:01.590 --> 01:28:04.140
He's on the root.
On the root.

01:28:08.784 --> 01:28:10.784
Move back! Fuck sake!

01:28:12.928 --> 01:28:14.928
Move back! Back!

01:28:15.812 --> 01:28:17.812
Come here, now!

01:28:23.492 --> 01:28:28.731
Take this uniform off
'cause you don't deserve it!

01:28:28.931 --> 01:28:31.552
You are not a 'Skull'
you are a coward.

01:28:31.752 --> 01:28:32.164
Do you understand?

01:28:32.364 --> 01:28:34.364
You are a coward.

01:28:51.703 --> 01:28:53.703
What is that?

01:28:57.400 --> 01:28:58.780
Don't mind about that.

01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:02.720
Let me see.
Everybody take those medicines.

01:29:02.878 --> 01:29:04.878
No worry.

01:29:05.903 --> 01:29:07.469
You wont need that anymore.

01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:10.644
You will quit and cease that pain.

01:29:11.778 --> 01:29:13.929
What?
Quit what?

01:29:14.129 --> 01:29:14.930
Quit what?

01:29:15.130 --> 01:29:16.867
You will quit BOPE.

01:29:17.067 --> 01:29:19.067
Won't you?

01:29:19.742 --> 01:29:21.742
What's wrong?

01:29:24.962 --> 01:29:26.373
You will quit, won't you?

01:29:26.573 --> 01:29:28.573
Are you ok?

01:29:30.683 --> 01:29:32.149
What's going on?

01:29:32.349 --> 01:29:35.579
I reckon that I picked the wrong guy.

01:29:36.136 --> 01:29:39.244
What's that mean?
It means that I fucked myself

01:29:39.444 --> 01:29:41.853
Azevedo chose one and
I chose another guy who is nuts!

01:29:42.053 --> 01:29:45.386
Why does Azevedo have priority?
You tell the Colonel that you are a dad...

01:29:45.586 --> 01:29:46.959
Azevedo's got two kids!

01:29:47.159 --> 01:29:50.654
Two kids! Two!
Not so loud! The baby is in bed! Fuck sake!

01:29:50.854 --> 01:29:55.683
There was only one thing that made me
more pissed off than go to the operations.

01:29:55.883 --> 01:30:00.787
Don't dismiss the guy yet,
you said he was good, what's wrong?

01:30:00.987 --> 01:30:04.403
That was Rosane telling
me what I should do.

01:30:04.603 --> 01:30:07.871
When is the graduation?

01:30:11.874 --> 01:30:15.019
Everything will be fine, just relax!

01:30:15.609 --> 01:30:18.446
Every little thing.
I love you!

01:30:26.863 --> 01:30:29.668
That is it, fella.
Are you sure?

01:30:31.098 --> 01:30:32.413
Hey, I got a better deal for you.

01:30:32.613 --> 01:30:34.533
Check this out,
that's a cool female Indian.

01:30:34.733 --> 01:30:38.218
Indian my ass.
'Stab the skull', brother.

01:30:58.656 --> 01:30:59.579
To the wall, move!

01:30:59.779 --> 01:31:03.762
The guys recently graduated in BOPE's
course are very sharp.

01:31:03.962 --> 01:31:07.022
And Neto enjoined that crazy action.

01:31:07.550 --> 01:31:11.213
As soon as he joined my team he just
kicked ass in Operation John Paul Second.

01:31:11.413 --> 01:31:14.303
He wanted to keep the Pope safe...

01:31:24.514 --> 01:31:26.514
And with him on my team

01:31:26.670 --> 01:31:29.390
30 scumbags were killed already.

01:31:36.292 --> 01:31:38.279
The BOPE's course prepares
the guys for the war.

01:31:38.479 --> 01:31:41.328
And I don't care if people say that
this is not humane.

01:31:41.528 --> 01:31:43.573
Rio de Janeiro is a city in war.

01:31:43.773 --> 01:31:48.521
If the gangsters are making money to buy
guns the war will keep going on and on.

01:31:48.721 --> 01:31:51.356
All BOPE's officers learn that.

01:31:52.996 --> 01:31:54.653
Matias was right.

01:31:54.853 --> 01:31:57.063
He might face those users.

01:32:00.486 --> 01:32:02.403
I'm leaving, people.
What's up

01:32:02.603 --> 01:32:04.347
I want to chat with you

01:32:04.547 --> 01:32:06.299
Come here!
Hold on!

01:32:06.499 --> 01:32:10.344
Chill out, I won't put you in
jail, not yet.

01:32:10.544 --> 01:32:12.423
Who said I'm afraid of that?

01:32:12.623 --> 01:32:15.098
You ass-kisser.

01:32:16.570 --> 01:32:18.308
Can you see those glasses?

01:32:18.508 --> 01:32:19.722
That is to Romerito.
Give me.

01:32:19.922 --> 01:32:22.130
Drop it now!

01:32:22.769 --> 01:32:25.668
I will take the glasses personally.
Right?

01:32:25.868 --> 01:32:32.072
If you go there, you will be...
I don't hang out with hooked.

01:32:32.957 --> 01:32:34.415
You'll do what I'll ask you.

01:32:34.615 --> 01:32:36.316
You gonna make it for tomorrow...

01:32:36.516 --> 01:32:37.317
At 12 o'clock

01:32:37.517 --> 01:32:40.775
In the arcade games, as I will
bring the glasses for the boy.

01:32:40.975 --> 01:32:42.975
Ask Maria!
Hey!

01:32:43.108 --> 01:32:45.108
Are you nuts, boy?

01:32:45.391 --> 01:32:46.923
If you don't do that shit for me

01:32:47.123 --> 01:32:48.530
I will put you in jail, right?

01:32:48.730 --> 01:32:50.730
You good-for-nothing.

01:32:50.847 --> 01:32:54.672
Do you think I don't know
what you sell here?

01:32:56.861 --> 01:32:59.241
Tomorrow at twelve o'clock!

01:33:13.365 --> 01:33:16.520
I'd better ask some
platinum for your nose.

01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:20.035
You are snorting too much.
Absolutely.

01:33:21.576 --> 01:33:23.576
Xaveco.

01:33:26.922 --> 01:33:27.711
Here they are.

01:33:27.911 --> 01:33:28.712
Galego,

01:33:28.912 --> 01:33:31.189
I will have no joint today,
'cause things are fucked up there.

01:33:31.389 --> 01:33:34.962
What's wrong, dude?

01:33:35.162 --> 01:33:38.559
That motherfucking cop,
he showed up and threatened me.

01:33:38.759 --> 01:33:43.425
What? -MPD?
Hey, What's the story?

01:33:45.777 --> 01:33:48.127
What's the story with that MPD?

01:33:48.327 --> 01:33:49.128
What'd he say?
He said...

01:33:49.328 --> 01:33:51.653
Say! Tell us!

01:33:51.853 --> 01:33:54.063
What the fuck is that?

01:33:54.263 --> 01:33:56.043
Neto.
What's up, Beto.

01:33:56.243 --> 01:33:58.444
There's a message from the office for you.
What message?

01:33:58.644 --> 01:34:04.679
Asking you to come at 10 o'clock
for an interview and I confirmed that.

01:34:06.563 --> 01:34:09.681
Alright, But...
I don't want nothing from them.

01:34:09.881 --> 01:34:14.180
Are you nuts?
That's the reason that you are studying.

01:34:14.380 --> 01:34:16.176
Get that job, guy.

01:34:16.376 --> 01:34:19.832
Go to the point!
No stuttering, come on!

01:34:20.032 --> 01:34:23.696
The NGO that Maria runs here...
Fuck the NGO!

01:34:23.896 --> 01:34:27.063
There's a kid down there who is blind...

01:34:27.263 --> 01:34:31.476
I can't make it.
I'm going to bring the glasses
for the little boy.

01:34:31.676 --> 01:34:34.268
He was born blind,
can't he wait a little bit more?

01:34:34.468 --> 01:34:37.486
What's the story?
Go to the point!

01:34:37.686 --> 01:34:42.044
He's coming up here so...
No, not here...

01:34:42.244 --> 01:34:46.239
You know how it's important
for me, don't you?

01:34:46.459 --> 01:34:47.834
What did you arrange with him?

01:34:48.034 --> 01:34:50.511
The meeting will be on the arcade games.
Say the fuckin' time!

01:34:50.711 --> 01:34:53.873
Open your mouth!
Twelve o'clock!

01:35:03.027 --> 01:35:06.843
Matias has told me much later that he 
wouldn't have gone to the interview if

01:35:07.043 --> 01:35:09.679
Neto hadn't insisted on it.

01:35:09.879 --> 01:35:12.514
He felt like becoming a lawyer.

01:35:12.714 --> 01:35:14.885
Have you got any idea about
what you're gonna do?

01:35:15.085 --> 01:35:17.149
Barely. I want to specialize in
criminal law.

01:35:17.349 --> 01:35:21.004
I didn't make a mistake
about my substitute.

01:35:27.844 --> 01:35:29.844
Hey, give me a coin.

01:35:30.662 --> 01:35:31.685
Are you losing or winning?

01:35:31.885 --> 01:35:32.686
losing.

01:35:32.886 --> 01:35:33.687
You can't lose, dude.

01:35:33.887 --> 01:35:36.522
Buddy, give some coins to him.

01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:48.170
Romerito.

01:35:48.370 --> 01:35:50.836
He's here, come on!
Hold on!

01:35:51.618 --> 01:35:53.645
There's a kid!
Anyway the guy is trapped.

01:35:53.845 --> 01:35:54.646
Are you Romerito?
Yes sir.

01:35:54.846 --> 01:35:56.846
Give me a shake.

01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:59.060
I have a gift for you.

01:36:00.368 --> 01:36:01.369
That is it.

01:36:01.569 --> 01:36:03.387
Now you will be able to see, right?

01:36:03.587 --> 01:36:04.388
Where is he?

01:36:04.588 --> 01:36:07.094
At work, try it!

01:36:07.294 --> 01:36:08.095
Wow, dude!

01:36:08.295 --> 01:36:09.896
Now you have a businessman look.

01:36:10.096 --> 01:36:12.096
No jokes, man!

01:36:12.697 --> 01:36:15.842
Hey, I think you'd better leave now.

01:36:18.558 --> 01:36:20.558
Get out!

01:36:28.576 --> 01:36:32.486
Don't shoot, 'cause I will kill that scumbag.

01:36:32.646 --> 01:36:33.557
What's wrong?

01:36:33.757 --> 01:36:34.558
What the fuck?

01:36:34.758 --> 01:36:36.758
What the fuck?

01:36:38.730 --> 01:36:41.477
Fuck Sake.

01:36:43.292 --> 01:36:45.405
Motherfuckin' BOPE.

01:36:45.605 --> 01:36:46.406
Move, move.

01:36:46.606 --> 01:36:47.407
Get the body out of here.

01:36:47.607 --> 01:36:48.408
He's still alive!

01:36:48.608 --> 01:36:50.608
Stop the car, now!

01:36:51.814 --> 01:36:54.024
Get out, get out!
Get out!

01:36:55.591 --> 01:36:56.680
Get the fuck out! Get out!

01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.788
Take Lombada out of here.

01:37:04.830 --> 01:37:05.963
Kill the fuckin' 'pig'!

01:37:06.163 --> 01:37:09.396
The dude who runs a slum can be nuts
but cannot be stupid.

01:37:09.596 --> 01:37:13.565
Baiano knew that to kill one of BOPE is the same
as signing your death warrant.

01:37:13.765 --> 01:37:16.485
Gangsters don't take it so easy.

01:37:17.113 --> 01:37:20.428
If Neto dies, Baiano will be fucked up.

01:37:21.531 --> 01:37:22.786
Hello!
How are you?

01:37:22.986 --> 01:37:26.019
Only rich people with social conscience
don't understand that.

01:37:26.219 --> 01:37:28.219
War is war.

01:37:35.083 --> 01:37:35.865
What the hell?

01:37:36.065 --> 01:37:39.273
You shut the fuck up!

01:37:53.527 --> 01:37:55.873
What's going on?

01:38:17.801 --> 01:38:19.853
Can you tell me where's Matias?

01:38:20.053 --> 01:38:22.053
Over there.

01:38:24.691 --> 01:38:26.095
He will stand, Carvalho.

01:38:26.295 --> 01:38:28.199
What do you mean?
Yes, he will.

01:38:28.399 --> 01:38:32.989
He was shot twice in the back.
They left immediately.

01:38:34.664 --> 01:38:36.664
What do you want?

01:38:37.139 --> 01:38:39.513
Is your friend ok?
No.

01:38:41.592 --> 01:38:43.717
I went to the PD, Andre.

01:38:43.833 --> 01:38:46.238
And they say they couldn't help me...

01:38:46.438 --> 01:38:48.988
How about the kid?
He's fine.

01:38:49.112 --> 01:38:52.257
He's gonna stay with me in my place.

01:38:54.876 --> 01:38:57.514
But they took Roberta and Rodrigues.

01:38:57.714 --> 01:39:01.054
Who cares, after all,
Baiano's got 'social conscience'.

01:39:01.254 --> 01:39:02.920
Don't be sarcastic, Andre.

01:39:03.120 --> 01:39:05.330
Rodrigues was bleeding...

01:39:05.441 --> 01:39:07.577
I thought that you
were an honest officer.

01:39:07.777 --> 01:39:09.902
No, I'm just an officer.

01:39:12.084 --> 01:39:15.211
Besides that, they have
already been murdered.

01:39:15.411 --> 01:39:17.411
No! No!!

01:39:21.507 --> 01:39:23.507
No!!

01:39:28.654 --> 01:39:30.318
I told you, didn't I?

01:39:30.518 --> 01:39:32.518
Here it is, my boss!

01:39:45.209 --> 01:39:47.285
No!!

01:40:01.795 --> 01:40:03.065
What's wrong? Are you ok?

01:40:03.265 --> 01:40:05.074
Don't say anything about
my job in this house!

01:40:05.274 --> 01:40:06.075
What?

01:40:06.275 --> 01:40:09.229
Don't say anything
about my job to me.

01:40:09.429 --> 01:40:10.511
Do you understand?

01:40:10.711 --> 01:40:16.419
I call the shots here and you are not
allowed to say anything about my team.

01:40:16.619 --> 01:40:19.849
Do you understand?
Do you understand?

01:40:21.696 --> 01:40:24.607
I call the fuckin' shots here!

01:40:40.714 --> 01:40:44.581
Listen to me. Go to your mom's place take
the boy and only come back when I call you.

01:40:44.781 --> 01:40:47.604
Where are you going?
Tell me! Please!

01:40:47.804 --> 01:40:50.354
I'm going to stay right here.

01:40:54.695 --> 01:40:58.953
Last night, two bodies were found,
'carbonizados' in Prazeres Slums.

01:40:59.153 --> 01:41:02.845
Look! The Police believe that the bodies
belong to the student, Roberta Lundi,

01:41:03.045 --> 01:41:07.738
daughter of the businessman, Alceu Lundi,
and the Social Agent, Pedro Rodriguez.

01:41:07.938 --> 01:41:14.117
Ana Luiza is live now with the Public
Safety Chief who gave a statement about it.

01:41:14.317 --> 01:41:18.245
Do you believe that one of the bodies found
belong to the student, Roberta Lundi?

01:41:18.445 --> 01:41:22.761
Let's wait for the exams of the
forensic experts to say something.

01:41:22.961 --> 01:41:30.016
However, I want to explain that all the
necessary measures have been taken already.

01:41:34.415 --> 01:41:36.415
What's wrong?

01:42:35.571 --> 01:42:37.919
Neto's death was a tragedy to Matias.

01:42:38.119 --> 01:42:41.349
They had been friends since childhood.

01:42:47.011 --> 01:42:49.288
And I felt that I could
get used to that feeling.

01:42:49.488 --> 01:42:52.973
And I still had my
mission to accomplish.

01:42:59.898 --> 01:43:02.883
What are you doing here?
Let's not argue, Andre.

01:43:03.083 --> 01:43:07.607
Am I arguing with you?
Am asking what are you doing here?

01:43:07.807 --> 01:43:09.942
I think I can help you.

01:43:10.962 --> 01:43:12.962
How can you help me?

01:43:15.272 --> 01:43:17.437
I know someone.

01:43:18.355 --> 01:43:20.355
Who?

01:43:21.773 --> 01:43:26.958
I tell you if you promise that
you won't make it bad for her.

01:43:28.091 --> 01:43:30.091
Right.
Who's that?

01:43:33.496 --> 01:43:35.496
Rose.

01:43:36.900 --> 01:43:39.280
Now you will say!
You bitch!

01:43:42.313 --> 01:43:44.313
You must tell us now!

01:43:45.403 --> 01:43:47.702
Where's your fuckin' boyfriend?
I don't know.

01:43:47.902 --> 01:43:51.325
Look at me. Where's that asshole?
I don't know.

01:43:51.525 --> 01:43:53.820
Where is he?
I don't know!

01:43:53.973 --> 01:43:57.033
Fuck sake, do you think I'm joking?

01:43:57.133 --> 01:44:01.528
Stop!.
You'd better tell us now!

01:44:17.798 --> 01:44:21.920
You lost! Put your hands up!
Look at me!

01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:24.672
Look at me and don't fuckin move.

01:44:24.872 --> 01:44:27.410
Don't fuckin move!
Where is Baiano?

01:44:27.610 --> 01:44:31.265
I don't know!
Where's the fuckin' scumbag?

01:44:35.473 --> 01:44:38.248
Where's the fuckin' Baiano?
You asshole!

01:44:38.448 --> 01:44:39.872
Where is Baiano?

01:44:40.072 --> 01:44:42.072
Tell us!

01:44:45.669 --> 01:44:46.759
Where is Baiano?

01:44:46.959 --> 01:44:50.568
Who is playboy?

01:44:51.038 --> 01:44:55.883
Playboy, who?
Captain, I know who he's talking about it.

01:45:46.004 --> 01:45:51.301
Nobody makes a protest for cops who are killed.
The protests are only for the high-society.

01:45:51.501 --> 01:45:54.152
When I see meetings
against the violence, dude.

01:45:54.352 --> 01:45:56.902
I feel like kicking everybody.

01:45:58.157 --> 01:45:59.075
You asshole!

01:45:59.275 --> 01:46:01.275
Stop!!
What?

01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:05.830
What the hell?
Get out!

01:46:08.474 --> 01:46:09.601
You asshole!

01:46:09.801 --> 01:46:11.801
Stop!
Fuck off!

01:46:12.524 --> 01:46:13.460
Stop!!!

01:46:13.660 --> 01:46:14.573
Get out of here!

01:46:14.773 --> 01:46:16.780
Don't hold me!
Stop!! Andre!

01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:18.513
He killed my friend. Shit!

01:46:18.713 --> 01:46:19.514
He killed my friend!

01:46:19.714 --> 01:46:24.207
What's wrong?
Are you trusting a cop?

01:46:24.407 --> 01:46:26.407
Are you beating a cop?

01:46:27.883 --> 01:46:29.067
Get out!

01:46:29.267 --> 01:46:30.909
You are a bunch of scumbags!

01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:32.833
Just like him

01:46:33.033 --> 01:46:36.374
All scumbags from high society.

01:46:36.651 --> 01:46:38.038
Get out of here, Andre.

01:46:38.238 --> 01:46:39.292
Get out!
What?

01:46:39.492 --> 01:46:40.293
You bitch!

01:46:40.493 --> 01:46:42.270
You are like him!

01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:44.470
Fuckin hooked.

01:46:44.663 --> 01:46:46.785
Matias wasn't there only because
of his friend.

01:46:46.985 --> 01:46:50.343
He was becoming a real cop.

01:46:50.543 --> 01:46:54.341
Fuck!-What?
Where's the fuckin' joint?

01:46:54.541 --> 01:46:58.770
You'd better say you fuckin' bastard,
where's the fuckin' joint?

01:46:58.970 --> 01:46:59.771
Stop, stop!!

01:46:59.971 --> 01:47:04.098
Ok, ok.
Hurry up!

01:47:04.298 --> 01:47:06.763
You faggot!
You motherfucker!

01:47:08.294 --> 01:47:12.449
The point was to find out if he would
have the heart to go until the end.

01:47:12.649 --> 01:47:14.083
Come on!

01:47:14.283 --> 01:47:17.938
My mission was not only
to protect the Pope.

01:47:18.337 --> 01:47:21.192
That mission,
Neto had already accomplished.

01:47:21.392 --> 01:47:23.684
What I wanted was to
come back to my family.

01:47:23.884 --> 01:47:26.077
And pick someone with
dignity to replace me.

01:47:26.277 --> 01:47:27.530
Get out! Get out!

01:47:27.730 --> 01:47:29.165
Get out!
Get out!

01:47:29.365 --> 01:47:30.458
To do that...

01:47:30.658 --> 01:47:32.984
First I should seek Baiano.

01:47:33.184 --> 01:47:34.174
Get out!
To the corner!

01:47:34.374 --> 01:47:36.442
What I was doing wasn't legal.

01:47:36.642 --> 01:47:38.767
To the wall!
To the wall!

01:47:38.918 --> 01:47:40.918
Turn around! Get out!

01:47:41.006 --> 01:47:44.287
I couldn't abuse the community
just to seek Baiano.

01:47:44.487 --> 01:47:46.031
At that point, dude...

01:47:46.231 --> 01:47:48.254
for me, all is fair in war.

01:47:48.454 --> 01:47:50.532
Nothing in this world
would stop me!

01:47:50.732 --> 01:47:53.026
Take your team to do the 'three-six-zero' up there.
Yes sir.

01:47:53.226 --> 01:47:54.356
In that entrance over there.

01:47:54.556 --> 01:47:56.264
There's nobody around it.
Yes, Sir.

01:47:56.464 --> 01:47:58.574
We gonna take the scumbags out,
house by house.

01:47:58.774 --> 01:47:59.575
Open!

01:47:59.775 --> 01:48:01.775
Police!

01:48:02.417 --> 01:48:04.882
Wake up, motherfucker! Move!

01:48:06.741 --> 01:48:08.741
Good morning, son!

01:48:08.898 --> 01:48:11.672
I would like to ask permission to do
a search in your house.

01:48:11.872 --> 01:48:12.673
Yes, Sir!

01:48:12.873 --> 01:48:14.623
Can I make myself at home?
Yes.

01:48:14.823 --> 01:48:18.308
'Zero-four'!
Do a search in the wardrobe.

01:48:21.339 --> 01:48:22.805
Check this out!

01:48:23.005 --> 01:48:23.806
'Zero-one'!

01:48:24.006 --> 01:48:26.391
This is more expensive than my gun.

01:48:26.591 --> 01:48:28.385
Where did you get these shoes, son?

01:48:28.585 --> 01:48:29.386
I won them, sir!

01:48:29.586 --> 01:48:30.387
You lost, come on!

01:48:30.587 --> 01:48:35.156
Capt. I'm having a bad feeling about it.
The community is observing us.

01:48:35.356 --> 01:48:37.722
I really got a shitty feeling.
Renan!!

01:48:37.922 --> 01:48:41.284
The guy killed Neto. I'm here because of him
and I'm gonna put him down today!

01:48:41.484 --> 01:48:46.380
Do you wanna quit?
We'll go to the jail!

01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:49.228
If you wanna leave, go ahead
take your guys with you and go.

01:48:49.428 --> 01:48:50.930
Are you feeling pity?

01:48:51.130 --> 01:48:52.419
Take all the 5 guys with you.

01:48:52.619 --> 01:48:53.875
Stay here only if you want!

01:48:54.075 --> 01:48:56.169
Move, stand up!

01:48:56.369 --> 01:48:59.421
Are you a student?
Do you know how to fly?

01:48:59.621 --> 01:49:01.621
Get down on your knees.

01:49:01.736 --> 01:49:04.180
I don't want to hurt you

01:49:04.380 --> 01:49:07.606
I don't want you to be injured. Ok?
Yes, sir.

01:49:07.806 --> 01:49:09.605
Where is Baiano?
I don't know, sir.

01:49:09.805 --> 01:49:13.715
Bullshit!
I'm gonna show you the plastic bag.

01:49:14.089 --> 01:49:15.678
Get down on your knees.

01:49:15.878 --> 01:49:20.636
My son, where is Baiano?
I don't know!

01:49:20.836 --> 01:49:22.637
Where is Baiano?
I don't know.

01:49:22.837 --> 01:49:23.638
Where is Baiano??
Dunno!

01:49:23.838 --> 01:49:26.152
Tell us!
Where is Baiano?

01:49:26.352 --> 01:49:28.600
Bring the plastic bag.

01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:39.790
Where is Baiano?

01:49:39.990 --> 01:49:42.507
Where is the fuckin Baiano,
you faggot!

01:49:42.707 --> 01:49:44.569
You're gonna die!
Tell us!

01:49:44.769 --> 01:49:46.161
I don't know, sir.

01:49:46.361 --> 01:49:49.336
Capt., he doesn't want to say, sir.

01:49:49.466 --> 01:49:51.466
Take his pants off.

01:49:51.499 --> 01:49:54.814
Are you going to tell us,
motherfucker?

01:50:00.368 --> 01:50:02.368
Give me that shit!

01:50:02.801 --> 01:50:04.275
Take his pants off!

01:50:04.475 --> 01:50:08.210
No, not my ass!
I tell you, I tell you.

01:50:08.410 --> 01:50:10.450
Go ahead!
Ok, take him.

01:50:23.805 --> 01:50:29.748
Fuck sake,
that calmness is too strange.

01:50:31.445 --> 01:50:33.802
Relax, my boss, we gonna
stay locked here.

01:50:34.002 --> 01:50:36.200
I don't know,
I got a bad feeling.

01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:39.035
This slum is very quiet today.

01:50:41.309 --> 01:50:43.689
Relax.
Relax, my ass. Fuck!

01:50:45.070 --> 01:50:47.072
Go and get some water.

01:50:47.272 --> 01:50:49.272
Here it is.

01:51:14.191 --> 01:51:16.663
Nobody in here, Capt.

01:51:25.584 --> 01:51:30.614
Hey, take me to the hospital, please.

01:51:34.277 --> 01:51:36.039
You lost, you scumbag.

01:51:36.239 --> 01:51:37.040
You lost!

01:51:37.240 --> 01:51:39.240
You gonna die!

01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:41.846
Not in my face.
To not mess up my funeral.

01:51:42.046 --> 01:51:46.211
What?
Not in my face, to not mess up my funeral.

01:51:47.372 --> 01:51:48.721
Baiano was in my hands.

01:51:48.921 --> 01:51:49.722
'Zero-seven'!

01:51:49.922 --> 01:51:52.327
Bring the Pumpshot here.

01:51:52.527 --> 01:51:53.732
Release that boy.

01:51:53.932 --> 01:51:56.091
Now there was only Matias' heart missing.

01:51:56.291 --> 01:51:59.542
And then my mission
would be accomplished.

01:51:59.742 --> 01:52:01.971
And then I would
be back to my family.

01:52:02.171 --> 01:52:04.225
I knew that I found someone
with dignity to replace me.

01:52:04.425 --> 01:52:06.563
Go ahead and kill him!

01:52:08.017 --> 01:52:10.017
Hold on!

01:52:10.918 --> 01:52:12.918
Hold on!

01:52:14.933 --> 01:52:16.933
Fuck, not in my face.
