"Where life had no value,
death, sometimes, had its price.

04:03.084 --> 04:07.545
That is why
the bounty killers appeared."

04:20.569 --> 04:22.332
Tickets.

04:23.272 --> 04:25.796
Tickets, please.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.577
Thank you. Tickets.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.084
Is it far to Tucumcari?

04:37.152 --> 04:39.245
We should pass there
in about three or four minutes.

04:39.320 --> 04:40.651
Thanks.

04:40.723 --> 04:44.055
Excuse me, but you've
made a mistake, Reverend.

04:44.125 --> 04:46.616
I couldn't help hearing
you're going to Tucumcari.

04:46.695 --> 04:49.858
I peddle goods around here, and I better
tell you you're on the wrong train.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.967
I think the nearest stop
to Tucumcari is Amarillo.

04:57.038 --> 05:00.303
By getting off at Sante Fe
and returning by way of Amarillo...

05:00.375 --> 05:04.142
you should be able to get
right where you're going.

05:06.548 --> 05:10.712
You see, the train
doesn't stop at Tucumcari.

05:20.962 --> 05:23.397
This train'll stop at Tucumcari.

05:49.091 --> 05:51.923
Take it easy, everybody!

05:51.993 --> 05:54.257
Why'd you stop?
Something gone wrong?

05:54.329 --> 05:56.524
Somebody pulled the emergency cord.

06:06.909 --> 06:10.538
Hey, mister, you just can't pull
the emergency cord and jump off.

06:10.613 --> 06:13.673
Why'd you stop that train?
If you want to get off, you...

06:14.683 --> 06:18.209
Well, the railroad company'd be mighty
pleased to make any arrangements...

06:18.286 --> 06:21.414
for any passenger if you want
to get off here, sir.

06:21.490 --> 06:24.185
I did get off. Thanks.

06:26.762 --> 06:29.993
All right, let's go!
Go ahead!

07:03.699 --> 07:07.464
Guy passed by here in person
and added on those two zeros.

07:07.536 --> 07:11.164
He was spittin' mad when he saw what
they was offerin'. He wasn't flattered.

07:11.240 --> 07:14.402
He said, "A measly thousand bucks
for me is much too little.

07:14.476 --> 07:17.308
I'm worth a lot more than that."

07:17.378 --> 07:20.370
He said that, and then he added
the zeros on the thousand.

07:22.216 --> 07:25.777
There isn't anyone got the guts
to face that killer, eh?

07:33.361 --> 07:35.262
At least...

07:35.330 --> 07:38.094
it's been that way till now.

08:18.440 --> 08:19.702
Where is he?

08:35.224 --> 08:37.158
Where is he?

08:45.501 --> 08:47.435
I have no idea
where he'd be today.

09:10.191 --> 09:12.126
- Hold still.
- But Guy...

09:12.194 --> 09:15.094
- Hold still, I said.
- You hurt me with those hands of yours.

09:15.164 --> 09:17.927
- Then do as I tell ya.
- Stop it!

09:17.999 --> 09:20.867
>Now see, you've made me drop the soap.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.868
- Wait, I'll get it for ya.
- You're killing me.

09:27.876 --> 09:29.844
Oh, look. What's that?

10:12.186 --> 10:14.747
Pardon me, ma'am.

11:45.479 --> 11:47.276
I'll kill you for this.

11:59.026 --> 12:01.655
There you are.
A thousand dollars.

12:12.140 --> 12:14.334
What do you know about Cavanagh?

12:14.408 --> 12:17.469
About a week ago
he was seen at White Rocks.

12:17.546 --> 12:19.706
Thanks.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.045
If it's of any interest to ya...

12:22.117 --> 12:24.710
somebody else dropped in
to see me about him.

12:25.720 --> 12:26.983
Who?

12:27.055 --> 12:29.819
I'd never seen him before.

12:29.891 --> 12:32.518
His name is Monco.

14:02.744 --> 14:04.679
Light?

14:06.849 --> 14:09.282
You know Baby Cavanagh?

14:12.421 --> 14:15.083
>Now tell me,
you know where I can find him?

14:22.098 --> 14:25.123
There, at that table.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.134
He's got his back to ya.

14:30.839 --> 14:32.773
Thanks.

15:38.107 --> 15:40.041
Two cards.

16:19.915 --> 16:22.041
Didn't hear what the bet was.

16:25.253 --> 16:26.743
Your life.

16:55.850 --> 16:58.819
Alive or dead...
it's your choice.

17:01.790 --> 17:04.257
Let Red go.

17:41.263 --> 17:44.130
Two thousand dollars.
It's a lot of money.

17:44.199 --> 17:46.462
Takes me three years to earn it.

17:46.535 --> 17:50.767
Tell me, isn't a sheriff
supposed to be courageous, loyal...

17:50.838 --> 17:52.773
and above all, honest?

17:53.776 --> 17:56.006
Yeah, that he is.

18:08.590 --> 18:10.853
I think you people
need a new sheriff.

21:11.707 --> 21:13.766
Hughie.

21:49.878 --> 21:51.812
How are you, >Nino?

21:51.880 --> 21:53.814
Better when I see you.

22:06.995 --> 22:08.929
Go on. Go ahead.

22:30.986 --> 22:32.384
Open it.

22:51.305 --> 22:54.536
- What's up? Who is it?
- Rodriguez, senor.

23:26.607 --> 23:29.236
You. Come along.

23:44.492 --> 23:46.427
I'm letting you live, hero.

23:46.495 --> 23:49.691
That's so you can tell everybody
you've seen what takes place here.

24:49.053 --> 24:50.988
For the lousy money.

24:59.229 --> 25:01.663
You took money
to put me behind bars.

25:04.702 --> 25:06.636
You should've killed me
when you could.

25:07.471 --> 25:09.405
It would be better for you.

25:10.741 --> 25:12.732
And for them.

25:16.013 --> 25:18.174
How old's the boy?

25:21.786 --> 25:24.015
How old is the boy, I asked?

25:24.955 --> 25:26.651
He's 18 months now.

25:28.125 --> 25:30.959
Just the time that I was in jail.

25:33.664 --> 25:35.928
You used the reward that you got...

25:36.000 --> 25:38.434
to start raising a family.

25:40.104 --> 25:42.334
And that's why I feel
your family is partly mine.

25:45.042 --> 25:47.442
I'll take my part now.

25:47.511 --> 25:49.445
Outside.

25:52.950 --> 25:56.909
They're both innocent. Please let them
go! I was the one. You know that.

26:25.249 --> 26:28.741
I know.
I'm sure you hate me just enough.

26:52.042 --> 26:54.603
This time you'll have a chance
to shoot me, but not in the back.

26:58.382 --> 26:59.576
Let go.

27:06.056 --> 27:08.286
When you hear the music finish, begin.

27:09.993 --> 27:11.927
Or do you think you can?

27:15.432 --> 27:17.491
Let's start.

29:13.617 --> 29:15.585
>Now.

29:54.358 --> 29:57.191
- Check those figures again.
- Yes, sir.

30:00.230 --> 30:02.494
Good day, sir. Good afternoon.

30:02.566 --> 30:05.228
Mortimer.

30:05.302 --> 30:08.363
- Douglas Mortimer.
- Mortimer. Virginia, isn't it?

30:08.438 --> 30:11.134
- Carolina.
- That's right, Carolina.

30:11.209 --> 30:13.472
Can I help in some way?

30:13.543 --> 30:17.502
- I'm looking for a first-class bank.
- Oh, but exactly.

30:17.581 --> 30:19.048
Yeah.

30:19.116 --> 30:22.517
The largest and most secure bank
in the territory.

30:22.586 --> 30:25.384
Well, Mr. Mortimer,
I want to assure you our bank here...

30:25.455 --> 30:28.117
has everything...
all the safeguards you're looking for.

30:28.191 --> 30:31.456
I don't doubt that, but I have
a large sum to deposit.

30:31.528 --> 30:33.655
>Now, suppose I'm a bandit.

30:36.466 --> 30:38.434
A bandit?

30:38.502 --> 30:41.494
A very dangerous bandit
with a gang of killers.

30:41.571 --> 30:46.270
What would be the most
impossible bank for me to rob?

30:46.344 --> 30:50.007
In your case, the one bank
I would suggest is the Bank of El Paso.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.207
>Not even Indio would dare
to attack that one.

30:52.282 --> 30:54.876
It's not a bank.
It's a fortress there.

30:59.923 --> 31:02.323
What time's the next train
for El Paso?

31:02.392 --> 31:04.826
11:30. I'll telegraph
to my colleague...

31:04.895 --> 31:07.193
in the Bank of El Paso
that you're going to arrive.

31:07.264 --> 31:09.323
Thanks.

31:34.392 --> 31:37.087
Hey, mister. Captain.
General. Welcome.

31:37.161 --> 31:40.493
Do you need a stable or a room?
Do you want to take a bath?

31:40.565 --> 31:43.328
My name is Fernando.
The stable is right here.

31:43.401 --> 31:45.197
And that is your hotel.

31:46.269 --> 31:48.863
Why this hotel
and not some other?

31:48.940 --> 31:51.601
You probably wouldn't like
that other place as much, senor.

31:51.675 --> 31:54.906
You'd have to spend half the night
shootin' cockroaches.

31:54.978 --> 31:57.378
At this hotel, the rooms
will cost you so much less.

31:57.447 --> 31:59.438
And there's a landlady
at this one, senor.

32:01.051 --> 32:03.383
- Married?
- Yes, but she doesn't care.

32:22.373 --> 32:25.671
That's the bank. As soon as I get
some money, I'll put it in.

32:25.742 --> 32:28.040
Well, you're gonna have
to earn it first.

32:29.946 --> 32:32.414
I have 50 cents here for you
if you'll let me know...

32:32.482 --> 32:36.976
when anybody you've never seen before
here in El Paso comes to town.

32:37.053 --> 32:40.250
At the hotel, senor.
A stranger just came outta there.

32:47.431 --> 32:49.365
Where's he staying?

32:58.408 --> 33:00.342
The hotel.

33:04.047 --> 33:06.709
Let me know if you see
any more strangers.

33:06.783 --> 33:09.013
Sure, senor.

33:24.267 --> 33:27.532
- Help you, sir?
- I want the room right above.

33:27.604 --> 33:30.937
I'm sorry, it's occupied.
It's too bad.

33:31.007 --> 33:33.874
The hotel's filled to capacity.
I'm sorry.

33:33.944 --> 33:36.970
The room you want is our best.
It's always occupied.

33:37.047 --> 33:38.241
By who?

33:39.282 --> 33:41.011
Check the register.

33:41.084 --> 33:42.676
Mary!

33:44.354 --> 33:46.584
It's Senor Martinez.

33:55.198 --> 33:58.430
- It's free now.
- That room is taken!

33:59.770 --> 34:01.703
I'll see to it.

34:06.911 --> 34:10.141
He's nothing but a wild,
vicious animal!

34:10.214 --> 34:12.147
He's tall, isn't he?

34:16.254 --> 34:18.187
You're just dirty!

34:30.500 --> 34:33.230
Proprietor, quick! My bill!

34:33.303 --> 34:35.237
I want my bill!

34:37.475 --> 34:40.534
- Before he comes down, give me my bill.
- There's no need to check out.

34:40.610 --> 34:43.806
Everything's gonna be all right.
I'll give you another room immediately.

34:43.880 --> 34:47.145
It's the best in the whole hotel.
We'll let him have the bridal suite.

34:47.217 --> 34:49.583
>No, Mary, the bill.
I'd like to stay, only I can't.

34:49.652 --> 34:52.382
- Don't go, Mr. Martinez.
- I have an appointment elsewhere.

34:56.693 --> 34:58.821
Yes, senor, what do you want?

35:04.768 --> 35:06.702
I don't wear 'em.

35:06.770 --> 35:08.931
I'm honored that you thought of me.
Thank you.

35:48.678 --> 35:51.306
Watch this.

36:15.138 --> 36:17.073
Hello, my friends.

36:18.341 --> 36:20.138
Hello, Indio.

36:20.210 --> 36:23.180
You see, I didn't waste
a minute coming here.

36:23.247 --> 36:26.147
Indio calls and Groggy
comes running right away.

36:26.216 --> 36:27.707
And Sancho?

36:27.785 --> 36:31.618
If you're waiting for Sancho, I'll go
and come back in about four years.

36:31.689 --> 36:35.055
He's in prison for four years.

36:41.698 --> 36:45.259
Bad for him.
>Not so bad for the rest of us.

36:45.335 --> 36:48.305
A man who gets caught
doesn't deserve respect, huh?

36:50.774 --> 36:52.969
What's it all about, huh?

36:53.044 --> 36:54.602
>Now just listen.

36:58.982 --> 37:00.575
A bank at El Paso.

37:02.452 --> 37:03.852
Let's see.

37:03.921 --> 37:08.948
We'll say this is the inside
of the bank. >Nino is the safe.

37:09.026 --> 37:12.017
Which weighs three tons
and can't be opened with dynamite.

37:13.663 --> 37:15.597
There's the part with two cashiers.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.528
This is the manager's desk.

37:19.602 --> 37:22.401
Right in back is a fancy cabinet
containing bottles...

37:22.472 --> 37:25.066
for offering drinks
to the rich depositors.

37:26.977 --> 37:31.073
There's the main door, and opposite
they built a double wall.

37:31.147 --> 37:33.115
What happens, Groggy?

37:33.183 --> 37:37.176
Let's say you've already killed
the two cashiers and the manager.

37:37.254 --> 37:41.189
For the next few minutes,
you're the boss of the bank.

37:41.257 --> 37:43.191
>Now what?

37:44.227 --> 37:46.526
The time's been wasted.

37:48.098 --> 37:51.830
Right, a waste of time.
Especially, Groggy, to blast open...

37:51.901 --> 37:55.632
that damn iron safe, we'd have
to be using so much dynamite...

37:55.705 --> 37:58.640
that the whole bank
would just disappear.

37:58.709 --> 38:01.700
And you'd all go up with it.

38:01.778 --> 38:06.511
Besides, the presence of a safe alone
doesn't always signify...

38:06.584 --> 38:08.414
that there is money inside.

38:10.086 --> 38:12.020
To help you understand what I mean...

38:14.357 --> 38:18.794
I would like to relate
a nice little parable.

38:21.431 --> 38:24.196
Once upon a time
there was a carpenter.

38:26.469 --> 38:28.664
You don't think a carpenter
can make money, eh?

38:29.739 --> 38:32.173
>No? You're wrong.

38:33.276 --> 38:38.044
This one did well because
he was a builder of safes.

38:39.249 --> 38:41.444
There was a banker once...

38:41.518 --> 38:44.147
who decided he must have
his iron safe disguised...

38:44.220 --> 38:47.747
to look like a wood cabinet.

38:50.928 --> 38:52.861
To get it made...

38:52.930 --> 38:57.526
the banker goes to our carpenter
for the job, and one day...

38:58.635 --> 39:00.763
as destiny has it...

39:00.837 --> 39:03.397
the carpenter's in El Paso.

39:03.473 --> 39:06.671
He happens to walk into the bank there,
and what does he find?

39:07.678 --> 39:08.872
The cabinet.

39:09.979 --> 39:13.006
Since he'd worked on the cabinet,
he spotted it right away.

39:13.850 --> 39:16.683
From that day on,
he couldn't work anymore.

39:16.754 --> 39:19.779
Pity, because...

39:19.856 --> 39:22.689
there was something he had to do.

39:22.759 --> 39:25.557
There was this crazy idea.

39:25.629 --> 39:27.562
And it stayed...

39:31.669 --> 39:34.432
to put his hands on the money inside.

39:34.504 --> 39:36.439
Get in there and grab all the money.

39:38.174 --> 39:42.076
Sure, you think that carpenter
was lucky the way things work out...

39:42.145 --> 39:44.546
that he was lucky
to go in just that bank.

39:44.614 --> 39:46.548
It wasn't true.

39:48.585 --> 39:50.781
His good fortune stopped that day.

39:50.854 --> 39:53.220
Because later...

39:53.289 --> 39:55.223
as a prisoner...

39:57.961 --> 39:59.895
he ran into me.

40:04.868 --> 40:08.326
The carpenter told me the story,
and I tell you.

40:14.777 --> 40:17.075
The money isn't in the safe.
It's right in this!

40:20.683 --> 40:23.243
Almost a million dollars in it.

40:26.055 --> 40:28.615
Your colleague in Tucumcari told me
that this bank...

40:28.691 --> 40:31.854
has the largest deposits
in the whole state.

40:31.928 --> 40:34.055
Yes, that's correct,
Mr. Mortimer.

40:34.131 --> 40:38.328
Here at the bank at El Paso we have half
a million dollars in reserve on hand.

40:41.337 --> 40:45.205
I see. You sure this bank
is secure enough to hold that much?

40:45.276 --> 40:48.109
From the moment your money's
on deposit here...

40:48.178 --> 40:50.111
you can sleep without any worries.

40:53.249 --> 40:55.615
Besides...

40:55.685 --> 40:58.415
when the bank is closed,
an armed guard always remains here...

40:58.488 --> 41:01.116
and a patrol
is on guard outside.

41:01.190 --> 41:05.183
Even the Bank of San Francisco
isn't that well protected.

41:05.261 --> 41:08.924
Exactly. The truth is...

41:10.200 --> 41:12.258
to try robbing us
would be so futile...

41:12.335 --> 41:15.736
that only a complete fool
would attempt it.

41:15.805 --> 41:17.899
Yeah.

41:17.975 --> 41:20.033
Or a complete madman.

41:30.754 --> 41:32.914
Get out of the way!
Get out of here!

42:18.868 --> 42:20.803
More news, amigo.

42:23.073 --> 42:25.803
Another stranger in town?

42:25.875 --> 42:28.504
Yes. And I know something else.

42:34.250 --> 42:37.812
There was another stranger
I didn't tell you about.

42:37.888 --> 42:40.856
Listen to me,
you sawed-off little runt!

42:40.923 --> 42:43.414
I want to know how many men
there are all together.

42:43.493 --> 42:45.859
Well, there were two.
>Now there's two more.

42:45.928 --> 42:48.328
Where?

42:48.399 --> 42:50.765
In the saloon.

45:00.631 --> 45:01.961
Whiskey.

45:02.031 --> 45:05.228
Listen, mister, why do you choose
my place to commit suicide?

45:05.301 --> 45:08.702
I know that man.
It's a miracle you're alive.

45:08.772 --> 45:12.401
Why should a man walk around with
a pistol and let himself be insulted?

45:12.475 --> 45:14.410
It's mighty strange.

45:14.477 --> 45:16.446
If the hunchback didn't shoot you...

45:16.513 --> 45:20.004
he had a very important reason,
that's all.

45:21.685 --> 45:23.652
I was thinking that myself.

46:23.714 --> 46:26.307
1, 2...

46:26.382 --> 46:30.614
3, now 4, now 5...

46:38.828 --> 46:42.196
11, 12, 13...

46:42.265 --> 46:45.723
14, 15, 16...

46:45.801 --> 46:50.205
17, 18, 19...

46:50.274 --> 46:54.471
20, 21, 22...

46:54.544 --> 46:57.603
23, 24...

46:57.680 --> 47:00.478
25, 26...

47:00.549 --> 47:05.613
27, 28, 29...

47:05.689 --> 47:08.555
30, 31...

47:08.624 --> 47:11.957
32 and 33.

48:57.033 --> 48:58.966
All right, now.

49:00.504 --> 49:03.200
I don't know him!

49:03.272 --> 49:05.207
Come on, now, you know everybody.

49:05.274 --> 49:09.075
I don't know anybody anymore!
I'm dead! Understand?

49:09.145 --> 49:11.613
Well, there was a time
when I knew everybody.

49:11.680 --> 49:14.513
That was a long time ago
when all this was prairie.

49:14.584 --> 49:16.984
In these days everybody's in a hurry.
That's right...

49:17.053 --> 49:19.647
with your damned
good-for-nothing trains!

49:23.026 --> 49:24.515
Disgusting!

49:24.593 --> 49:26.926
One day, someone from the railroad
comes here to see me.

49:26.997 --> 49:30.660
He says, "Prophet, the railway's
gonna go right past your house."

49:30.734 --> 49:33.669
"Is that so?" I said.

49:33.736 --> 49:36.102
"Yep, that right," he says.

49:36.172 --> 49:38.402
"All those trains
gonna go right past here.

49:38.475 --> 49:40.806
The best thing for you, Prophet,
is sell your land to the company...

49:40.877 --> 49:42.605
or else we'll buy Baker's.

49:42.678 --> 49:45.442
He lives next to your place,
and I'll put the tracks here...

49:45.515 --> 49:47.607
and that'll make you go crazy.

49:47.683 --> 49:49.879
Will you sell out
to our company, Prophet?"

49:49.952 --> 49:52.421
"Oh, is that so?" says I.

49:54.256 --> 49:56.690
He was very anxious
for me to sell out.

49:56.759 --> 49:59.024
You know what I told him
about the railroad?

49:59.094 --> 50:01.961
You know what I told him
he could do with his railroad?

50:21.017 --> 50:23.712
You know what my decision
about selling was?

50:23.786 --> 50:25.720
Well, you said no.

50:25.788 --> 50:29.189
You're right about that.
>No to him and his damn trains!

50:29.258 --> 50:31.192
I wouldn't! >No!

50:31.260 --> 50:34.196
Look, listen to me, old man.

50:34.263 --> 50:36.198
You're supposed to be a prophet.

50:36.265 --> 50:39.098
I didn't come here to listen to you
rattle on about trains.

50:39.169 --> 50:42.569
I want to find out about this man.
It's obvious you don't know anything.

50:42.638 --> 50:45.402
>No need to be insulting.
If that's all you came here to do...

50:45.475 --> 50:48.443
you can clear out of my house fast
before I lose my temper.

50:48.511 --> 50:50.446
Understand?

50:54.216 --> 50:56.411
Hey! Where you goin'?

50:59.421 --> 51:02.219
I guess I better leave before
you go and lose your temper.

51:03.292 --> 51:05.624
What's the matter with you?
Why are you so dang stupid?

51:05.694 --> 51:07.629
Hurry up,
give me that pistol there.

51:07.696 --> 51:10.131
Yeah, right there behind ya.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.133
Hurry!

51:12.201 --> 51:15.602
Yes, that's the one.
>Now, hand it over.

51:15.671 --> 51:19.334
That's it. Give me that gun.
The man you asked about.

51:19.408 --> 51:22.401
There's only one question:
How does he carry his gun?

51:22.478 --> 51:24.673
He wears it here,
across his belly?

51:24.747 --> 51:28.205
Well, why didn't you tell me that
in the first place, my boy.

51:28.285 --> 51:30.752
Of course I know the man
you're trying to find out about.

51:30.819 --> 51:32.754
Of course I know him.

51:32.821 --> 51:35.654
He's Colonel Douglas Mortimer.

51:35.725 --> 51:38.625
Mortimer... a brave man, a soldier.

51:39.461 --> 51:41.952
He was known as the best shot
in the Carolinas.

51:42.031 --> 51:43.658
A great soldier.

51:43.732 --> 51:47.634
>Now he's reduced to being
a bounty killer, same as you.

51:47.703 --> 51:49.466
Because of trains!

51:49.538 --> 51:52.837
Because of the damn trains!
Damn 'em!

53:19.261 --> 53:23.198
Take it to the station.
The gentleman's leavin'.

53:27.836 --> 53:29.600
Hold it.

53:31.573 --> 53:33.040
Take it back.

53:36.312 --> 53:38.404
Take it to the station.

53:40.482 --> 53:43.383
- Go inside.
- The station!

54:52.388 --> 54:54.582
Just like the games we know.

55:50.212 --> 55:52.477
- He's picking it up.
- A trick, maybe.

57:38.252 --> 57:42.654
How can somebody in my business
go around with a contraption like this?

57:43.757 --> 57:45.691
That contraption...

57:46.960 --> 57:49.156
almost sent you to your grave.

57:51.164 --> 57:54.361
You're forgetting one thing, Colonel...
I was shooting at your hat.

57:54.435 --> 57:56.664
Well, I was only shooting at yours.

57:57.738 --> 58:00.002
But I recall firing first.

58:02.008 --> 58:03.839
Boy...

58:03.910 --> 58:07.107
I've reached almost 50 years
of age with my system.

58:07.180 --> 58:09.513
>Not many men last long
in these parts.

58:09.584 --> 58:11.847
How long do you expect to last?

58:13.587 --> 58:15.180
Much longer than that.

58:16.256 --> 58:20.091
When I get my hands on Indio
and that $ 10,000...

58:20.160 --> 58:23.527
I'm gonna buy myself a little place,
possibly retire.

58:25.132 --> 58:28.067
Well, I don't believe we ought
to start another fight.

58:28.135 --> 58:30.194
But you forget one small detail.

58:30.270 --> 58:31.794
What's that?

58:31.872 --> 58:34.136
I wanna get my hands on Indio too.

58:34.207 --> 58:36.642
Sure, after me.

58:38.312 --> 58:40.575
Or before you.

58:40.647 --> 58:42.582
Or at the same time.

58:45.719 --> 58:47.381
Is that a proposition?

58:48.789 --> 58:50.347
An equal partnership.

58:51.426 --> 58:53.290
Why? Why should I?

58:53.361 --> 58:55.294
I can think of three reasons.

58:55.363 --> 58:57.524
First is there's 14 of them.

58:57.597 --> 58:59.497
Yeah, that's a lot.

58:59.566 --> 59:01.124
A lot for me.

59:01.201 --> 59:03.727
Yeah. >No small number
even for two of us.

59:03.805 --> 59:05.397
Second reason?

59:06.673 --> 59:08.732
Second reason...

59:11.278 --> 59:13.906
The second reason is
you could make it 15 to one.

59:13.980 --> 59:16.448
Don't forget I wanna play
in this game too.

59:16.517 --> 59:20.919
As you're aware, when two hunters
go after the same prey...

59:20.988 --> 59:24.423
they usually end up shooting each other
in the back, and we don't want that.

59:28.796 --> 59:30.957
Then the colonel dies, hmm?

59:33.301 --> 59:35.200
All right, I'll be generous.

59:36.903 --> 59:39.531
You can have the reward
for Indio...

59:39.606 --> 59:41.801
and I'll take the reward
for the rest of the band.

59:45.145 --> 59:47.205
All wrong.

59:47.281 --> 59:51.774
Indio's worth $ 10,000 dollars, but
the rest adds up to much more than that.

59:51.852 --> 59:55.413
Blackie's worth four,
Wild's worth three, >Nino two.

59:55.489 --> 59:57.151
>Nino's one.

59:59.826 --> 01:00:02.227
Well, Frisco's worth two.

01:00:02.296 --> 01:00:04.786
That's ten thousand.

01:00:04.865 --> 01:00:06.765
Yeah, but...

01:00:06.834 --> 01:00:10.031
there's a few more that'll
add up to more than that, I'm sure.

01:00:10.103 --> 01:00:13.368
- How do you know that?
- I have my information.

01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:15.374
When all's said and done...

01:00:15.442 --> 01:00:18.502
I think I might just take you up
on your proposition.

01:00:21.716 --> 01:00:24.013
Let's drink to this partnership.

01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:31.019
To the partnership,
with no tricks, of course.

01:00:32.158 --> 01:00:33.853
>No tricks.

01:00:37.864 --> 01:00:39.263
>Now, then...

01:00:39.332 --> 01:00:43.736
you realize we're gonna have to figure
out some way to get them in the middle.

01:00:46.707 --> 01:00:50.642
One from the outside, one from
the inside. There's no other way.

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:54.147
One of us will have to
join Indio's band.

01:00:56.316 --> 01:00:58.841
Why are you looking at me
when you say "one of us"?

01:00:58.919 --> 01:01:00.580
Because they don't know you.

01:01:00.654 --> 01:01:03.522
Wild sees me and his hump
will catch on fire.

01:01:06.127 --> 01:01:07.685
Tell me...

01:01:07.761 --> 01:01:10.924
how do you propose that I
join up with Indio?

01:01:10.997 --> 01:01:13.966
Maybe bring him
a bunch of roses?

01:01:14.035 --> 01:01:18.471
You could do that, but I'd suggest
you take him Sancho Perez.

01:01:18.538 --> 01:01:20.836
Who's Sancho Perez?

01:01:20.908 --> 01:01:23.843
A friend of Indio's.
Right now he's cooling off.

01:01:23.910 --> 01:01:26.538
He's cooling off
in Alamogourdo jail.

01:01:26.613 --> 01:01:29.173
How do you know all this?

01:01:30.383 --> 01:01:32.681
I've got my information too.

01:01:34.754 --> 01:01:38.781
>Naturally, you'll have to arrange
for his, uh, release.

01:01:41.528 --> 01:01:42.325
>Naturally.

01:01:44.832 --> 01:01:46.799
Tell me...

01:01:46.866 --> 01:01:49.334
were you ever young?

01:01:52.939 --> 01:01:55.134
And just as reckless as you.

01:01:58.546 --> 01:02:01.480
Then one day something happened.

01:02:01.548 --> 01:02:03.312
Made life very precious to me.

01:02:03.383 --> 01:02:04.975
What's that?

01:02:10.957 --> 01:02:13.357
Or is the question indiscreet?

01:02:16.363 --> 01:02:18.490
The question isn't indiscreet.

01:02:19.834 --> 01:02:21.825
But the answer could be.

01:05:36.162 --> 01:05:40.292
They told me you were put away. You'd be
resting for four long years in prison.

01:05:43.002 --> 01:05:46.939
>No, Indio, for four weeks.
>No more than four weeks.

01:05:58.585 --> 01:06:00.417
Who is that with you?

01:06:00.486 --> 01:06:03.614
He got me out.
The man's a friend of mine.

01:06:11.164 --> 01:06:14.133
Why did he help you?
Did you ask him that?

01:06:15.736 --> 01:06:19.136
Yeah. Amigo, why did you
help me out?

01:06:21.107 --> 01:06:26.238
Well, there's such a big reward
being offered on all you gentlemen...

01:06:26.312 --> 01:06:29.475
that I thought I might just tag along
on your next robbery.

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:32.685
I might just turn you
into the law.

01:07:15.528 --> 01:07:17.120
Amigo...

01:07:18.765 --> 01:07:21.962
that's the one answer
that would prove you're all right.

01:07:24.171 --> 01:07:27.629
And you arrived just in time too.
The job is already set.

01:07:28.709 --> 01:07:30.267
It's tomorrow.

01:07:31.377 --> 01:07:33.470
The place is...

01:07:33.546 --> 01:07:35.980
the bank in El Paso.

01:07:38.318 --> 01:07:41.481
>Not far from El Paso
there's a little town, Santa Cruz.

01:07:41.555 --> 01:07:45.046
Tomorrow, Blackie, Chico,
Paco...

01:07:45.124 --> 01:07:48.287
and you, amigo...

01:07:48.361 --> 01:07:50.955
will rob the bank in Santa Cruz.

01:07:51.031 --> 01:07:54.193
Shoot, kill, get every gun
in the area after you...

01:07:54.267 --> 01:07:56.201
especially those from El Paso.

01:07:56.269 --> 01:07:59.671
Any others around,
we'll take care of them.

01:08:01.507 --> 01:08:04.477
And then after the job,
we'll all meet again at Las Palmeras.

01:08:08.948 --> 01:08:11.179
Where are you going?

01:08:17.224 --> 01:08:20.022
Well, if there's gonna be
any shooting...

01:08:21.095 --> 01:08:23.028
I gotta get my rest.

01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:44.859
Hey, amigo, you know when you told
that story yesterday, I fell for it.

01:08:44.935 --> 01:08:47.267
Big joke, wasn't it, amigo?

01:08:56.580 --> 01:08:58.411
Who said I was jokin'?

01:09:00.684 --> 01:09:02.652
I don't get that.
If it's true...

01:09:02.719 --> 01:09:05.153
Too bad you have to die.

01:09:09.326 --> 01:09:10.792
What is it?

01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:09.585
By now they should be
at Santa Cruz.

01:10:51.928 --> 01:10:53.452
Listen, shorty...

01:10:57.034 --> 01:11:00.834
Indio and his band have just
robbed the bank here in town.

01:11:00.904 --> 01:11:04.362
>Now why don't you just sit down
and send out the alarm to El Paso...

01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:07.308
and the rest of the towns around here
and warn 'em, right?

01:11:07.377 --> 01:11:11.040
But, mister, I didn't hear any shots
at the bank, and I sure would have.

01:11:11.114 --> 01:11:13.047
You might hear one.

01:11:13.116 --> 01:11:14.743
The alarm.

01:11:58.261 --> 01:12:00.286
Easy now.

01:12:00.364 --> 01:12:03.060
They've robbed the bank
at Santa Cruz!

01:12:04.701 --> 01:12:06.395
Follow me!

01:13:44.668 --> 01:13:47.466
Groggy, the telegraph wires.

01:15:41.184 --> 01:15:43.345
- Good day, gentlemen.
- Good day, sir.

01:15:46.355 --> 01:15:48.688
- Sir.
- Good afternoon.

01:17:38.768 --> 01:17:40.462
The other side.

01:18:24.447 --> 01:18:26.346
Eleven...

01:18:26.416 --> 01:18:27.781
twelve...

01:18:30.787 --> 01:18:32.584
Fourteen...

01:21:13.950 --> 01:21:15.611
Let's go!

01:22:38.868 --> 01:22:42.167
What are you doin' here?
You're not runnin' away, are you?

01:22:42.238 --> 01:22:43.967
>No, I'm not running away.

01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:47.703
I'm going after them and I'm going
alone. Our partnership is dissolved.

01:22:47.777 --> 01:22:49.608
Boy, let's wait
and talk it over.

01:22:49.679 --> 01:22:53.809
All we've done is talk.
I've been reasonable with no results.

01:22:53.882 --> 01:22:57.181
>Now take it easy. We only knew
the Santa Cruz part of this plan.

01:22:57.253 --> 01:23:00.381
You were the one who had
their strategy all worked out.

01:23:00.456 --> 01:23:03.084
- >Now I'm gonna meet Indio.
- I see. I better go along.

01:23:04.160 --> 01:23:06.094
I'm going alone... Me.

01:23:06.162 --> 01:23:09.563
I have an appointment with Indio
and I'm not gonna let anyone interfere.

01:23:09.632 --> 01:23:12.623
- You certain about that?
- That's right.

01:23:12.702 --> 01:23:15.170
In that case I'm sorry.

01:23:19.042 --> 01:23:23.741
That's not bad. Indio sent
four men to Santa Cruz.

01:23:23.813 --> 01:23:27.010
And one man returns...
a new man without a scratch.

01:23:27.083 --> 01:23:29.244
Mm-mm. Indio's no idiot.

01:23:29.318 --> 01:23:32.776
When you ride up to him and show him
that little nick, he might believe you.

01:23:33.855 --> 01:23:35.949
And don't forget,
that as of today...

01:23:36.025 --> 01:23:38.653
the whole gang's worth
$40,000 more.

01:23:38.728 --> 01:23:41.754
That's the reward offered by the bank
to get the money back.

01:23:41.831 --> 01:23:45.631
- Is the partnership operating again?
- Just how do you figure?

01:23:45.701 --> 01:23:50.604
Try to convince Indio to go north,
and then go along the Rio Bravo.

01:23:50.672 --> 01:23:53.870
It's a good spot for an ambush
and we can get him between two fires.

01:23:53.943 --> 01:23:57.743
You on the outside,
me on the inside, right?

01:23:59.114 --> 01:24:00.446
>North?

01:24:04.687 --> 01:24:06.177
>North.

01:24:25.341 --> 01:24:27.070
Hughie.

01:24:34.917 --> 01:24:39.377
Wait a minute. We need time to open it
and this isn't the right place.

01:25:08.951 --> 01:25:10.543
And the others?

01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:12.087
Dead?

01:25:13.288 --> 01:25:17.783
After Santa Cruz, we headed for El Paso
and they hit us from all sides.

01:25:19.262 --> 01:25:22.595
And you just saved your own skin,
isn't that right, you yellow...

01:25:42.151 --> 01:25:45.450
You did your part of it.
Let's go.

01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:47.148
Which way we headed?

01:25:48.224 --> 01:25:49.589
>North.

01:25:49.659 --> 01:25:52.855
>North? Along Rio Bravo canyon?

01:25:52.929 --> 01:25:54.520
Why not?

01:25:55.898 --> 01:25:58.366
Seems like a good place
for an ambush to me.

01:26:00.469 --> 01:26:02.403
You know a better way to go?

01:26:02.471 --> 01:26:04.404
Yeah, south.

01:26:06.475 --> 01:26:08.102
Ride to the border?

01:26:08.177 --> 01:26:12.204
They'll never expect you to cross the
border now that the alarm's been sent.

01:26:18.688 --> 01:26:20.918
Think we'll head east.

01:26:20.989 --> 01:26:24.323
There's a place I know about,
Agua Caliente.

01:26:25.394 --> 01:26:28.386
Here we are.
That's Agua Caliente.

01:26:29.465 --> 01:26:32.297
Yes, I have many friends here.

01:26:32.368 --> 01:26:34.302
It looks just like a morgue.

01:26:35.471 --> 01:26:37.496
But look out.

01:26:37.573 --> 01:26:39.700
It could be one so easily.

01:26:40.977 --> 01:26:44.378
- They don't like strangers.
- >No, they don't like anybody.

01:26:46.248 --> 01:26:50.185
Wild, you never saw
our friend here shoot, right?

01:26:54.290 --> 01:26:56.019
Did any of you?

01:26:59.028 --> 01:27:01.690
We don't know how you'd be
in emergencies.

01:27:02.797 --> 01:27:05.358
I was thinking,
this is the right place.

01:27:05.434 --> 01:27:07.698
I got a way
you can show the men.

01:27:10.105 --> 01:27:11.630
How's that?

01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:14.872
Go into town alone, amigo.

01:30:01.510 --> 01:30:02.636
Bravo.

01:30:53.262 --> 01:30:56.026
Do you mind tellin' me
how you got here?

01:30:56.098 --> 01:30:58.658
I just reasoned it out.

01:30:58.734 --> 01:31:00.929
I figured you'd tell Indio...

01:31:01.003 --> 01:31:04.461
to do just exactly the opposite
of what we agreed...

01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:07.407
and he's suspicious enough
to figure out somethin' else.

01:31:08.644 --> 01:31:12.239
Since El Paso was out of the question,
well, here I am.

01:31:14.550 --> 01:31:16.415
Rum... a double.

01:31:17.486 --> 01:31:19.420
Tequila for all of us.

01:31:36.171 --> 01:31:38.901
If it isn't the smoker.

01:31:50.052 --> 01:31:52.384
Remember me, amigo?

01:31:54.556 --> 01:31:57.720
Of course you do. El Paso.

01:32:00.796 --> 01:32:03.264
It's a small world.

01:32:03.332 --> 01:32:06.062
Yes, and very, very bad.

01:32:07.169 --> 01:32:10.332
>Now, come on.
You light another match.

01:32:12.107 --> 01:32:16.407
I generally smoke just after I eat.
Come back in ten minutes.

01:32:16.478 --> 01:32:20.380
Ten minutes you'll be smoking
in hell. Get up!

01:32:20.449 --> 01:32:21.814
Stay calm.

01:32:24.119 --> 01:32:26.053
On your feet.

01:32:33.762 --> 01:32:35.422
Cucillo.

01:32:36.599 --> 01:32:38.089
Count to three.

01:32:48.010 --> 01:32:49.875
One...

01:32:51.714 --> 01:32:53.375
two...

01:32:55.017 --> 01:32:56.609
three!

01:33:00.355 --> 01:33:02.051
Stop it!

01:33:24.346 --> 01:33:26.041
Who are you?

01:33:27.616 --> 01:33:29.550
I'm the one who can open
the safe for you.

01:33:34.355 --> 01:33:35.755
What safe, senor?

01:33:35.824 --> 01:33:39.260
The one from El Paso.
You got there ahead of me.

01:33:39.328 --> 01:33:41.262
- However...
- However?

01:33:43.165 --> 01:33:46.931
Open that safe and you're gonna
destroy half the bank notes.

01:33:47.002 --> 01:33:49.527
I can open it
without blowing it up.

01:33:57.946 --> 01:33:59.413
What'll it cost?

01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:00.971
Five thousand.

01:34:04.620 --> 01:34:06.554
Two's all I'll pay you.

01:34:07.690 --> 01:34:09.385
Five.

01:34:46.562 --> 01:34:48.496
Keep your hands off it!

01:34:48.564 --> 01:34:52.022
It's easy to steal.
The trouble is in keeping the loot.

01:34:52.101 --> 01:34:54.364
Take it out.

01:34:54.436 --> 01:34:56.734
>Now every man in >New Mexico
is after us.

01:34:56.805 --> 01:35:00.468
If they catch one of us with money
we'll all end up the same way.

01:35:00.542 --> 01:35:04.444
We're going to wait here for an
entire month if I think it's necessary.

01:35:04.513 --> 01:35:07.482
Then everybody will get his share.

01:35:07.549 --> 01:35:09.915
And you will wait a month
to get your money.

01:35:11.253 --> 01:35:12.880
>Naturally.

01:35:12.955 --> 01:35:15.321
I'll be in the tavern.

01:35:15.390 --> 01:35:19.520
The air around here stinks anyway,
just like the food.

01:35:19.595 --> 01:35:21.563
But the month will go fast.

01:36:01.804 --> 01:36:03.237
Right here.

01:36:04.306 --> 01:36:05.898
Let's go.

01:38:30.218 --> 01:38:32.413
I was worried about you.

01:38:32.487 --> 01:38:36.355
All alone with, uh,
so many problems to solve.

01:38:52.975 --> 01:38:55.102
It's all right here.

01:39:00.449 --> 01:39:02.110
Go ahead.

01:40:10.452 --> 01:40:13.012
You shouldn't have shot
the apples off that tree.

01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:26.433
Put it on.

01:42:33.134 --> 01:42:36.126
What's he doing now,
this sheriff of El Paso?

01:42:36.202 --> 01:42:39.468
Right now? Lookin' for the cash
that was in the bank.

01:42:40.608 --> 01:42:42.404
Right.

01:42:42.475 --> 01:42:47.277
And suppose he finds the bodies
of these men just outside El Paso...

01:42:47.348 --> 01:42:49.645
with lots of money on them?

01:42:51.184 --> 01:42:53.153
What will the sheriff think?

01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:55.017
Well, he...

01:42:55.089 --> 01:42:56.818
That's right.

01:44:14.003 --> 01:44:15.527
Slim.

01:44:18.774 --> 01:44:21.206
What is it, >Nino?

01:44:21.278 --> 01:44:25.007
A change of plans.

01:44:25.079 --> 01:44:28.309
Indio wants you to...

01:45:07.090 --> 01:45:09.023
It's not loaded.

01:45:32.814 --> 01:45:35.443
I think you should
get out fast now.

01:45:35.518 --> 01:45:38.782
Here's your guns without bullets.

01:45:38.854 --> 01:45:41.755
Listen. Don't you let Indio
find you both around.

01:46:30.473 --> 01:46:33.930
I know you don't like questions,
but why are you doing this?

01:46:36.946 --> 01:46:39.938
How long have you known
that Monco's a bounty killer?

01:46:41.850 --> 01:46:44.114
I found out tonight. Why?

01:46:47.322 --> 01:46:50.349
I knew he was one from
the first moment he arrived.

01:46:56.064 --> 01:46:59.000
The other one's also
a bounty killer.

01:47:00.603 --> 01:47:02.662
So I have an idea.

01:47:02.737 --> 01:47:04.898
They'll be useful to us.

01:47:06.242 --> 01:47:07.868
We'll try it.

01:47:08.944 --> 01:47:12.437
Those men are a lot better
than mine with a gun.

01:47:12.514 --> 01:47:16.781
So we'll let all of them
get mixed up in a gun battle.

01:47:16.853 --> 01:47:19.787
But that won't
really matter to me.

01:47:22.390 --> 01:47:23.915
Or you.

01:47:26.062 --> 01:47:29.087
Because we'll be far away, right?

01:47:34.569 --> 01:47:37.265
And we'll have all the money.

01:47:39.841 --> 01:47:41.639
Go on.

01:47:41.711 --> 01:47:43.940
Go on and wake Cucillo.

01:48:33.395 --> 01:48:34.727
Who did it?

01:48:34.796 --> 01:48:37.357
Why don't you look
at the knife?

01:48:45.640 --> 01:48:47.608
It's mine.

01:48:47.676 --> 01:48:50.645
Then it shouldn't be there,
should it?

01:49:00.255 --> 01:49:03.419
But I didn't kill him.
I didn't do it.

01:49:05.928 --> 01:49:08.590
It's difficult to prove that.

01:49:11.334 --> 01:49:12.823
I am innocent.

01:49:12.902 --> 01:49:15.426
One of your horses is outside.

01:49:16.505 --> 01:49:18.973
Let's see if you can get to it.

01:50:06.721 --> 01:50:08.211
He just killed Slim.

01:50:10.192 --> 01:50:14.424
And he... he helped those
two bounty killers get away.

01:50:18.233 --> 01:50:19.791
I want them back...

01:50:21.437 --> 01:50:23.131
right now.

01:50:36.051 --> 01:50:38.349
What are you doing here?

01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:40.912
Go and get them back!

01:50:45.161 --> 01:50:49.996
Those two bounty killers are sitting on
our backs and must be killed right away.

01:50:55.071 --> 01:50:57.005
We can't let 'em go free.

01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:13.479
It's done now.

01:51:15.491 --> 01:51:17.788
Prepare to get out of here.

01:52:00.736 --> 01:52:01.997
Here.

01:52:03.772 --> 01:52:05.433
Hold it.

01:52:10.045 --> 01:52:12.912
>Not a bad idea.

01:52:12.982 --> 01:52:15.506
But I'm one thing
you forgot about.

01:52:15.584 --> 01:52:17.278
Open it up now.

01:52:39.073 --> 01:52:41.304
All right, come on now,
open it.

01:53:39.715 --> 01:53:41.911
Leave Indio to me.

01:53:44.821 --> 01:53:46.345
All right.

01:54:18.688 --> 01:54:20.814
Where in hell is it?

01:54:49.085 --> 01:54:52.577
I'll kill 'em, but I'll rip
out their guts first.

01:54:52.654 --> 01:54:54.589
I have a plan.

01:55:01.029 --> 01:55:03.054
What?

01:55:03.132 --> 01:55:05.260
Let's just wait.

01:55:05.335 --> 01:55:07.461
They'll be back here.

01:55:09.505 --> 01:55:12.770
And this way,
there'll be two of us.

01:55:12.841 --> 01:55:16.005
Can they come back here?
Your men could've killed them.

01:55:16.078 --> 01:55:18.013
Who? They?

01:55:21.416 --> 01:55:25.011
Are you sure of that?
That they haven't?

01:55:28.625 --> 01:55:30.819
I thought something different.

01:55:30.894 --> 01:55:35.729
You made the boys ride on out to
make sure they're both killed, and fast.

01:55:35.799 --> 01:55:38.996
I'm not as dumb
as the rest of them.

01:55:40.170 --> 01:55:42.104
There was no help for it.

01:57:15.631 --> 01:57:17.156
Go on.

01:59:05.140 --> 01:59:06.573
That watch...

01:59:08.044 --> 01:59:10.841
It's been a long time
that I wanted to ask.

01:59:12.314 --> 01:59:15.078
I can see that it means
a lot to you.

01:59:15.151 --> 01:59:16.675
Why?

02:00:53.381 --> 02:00:54.974
Listen to me!

02:00:56.818 --> 02:00:58.979
This is Colonel Mortimer!

02:01:01.590 --> 02:01:03.218
Douglas Mortimer!

02:01:05.495 --> 02:01:07.894
Does the name
mean anything to you?

02:02:40.456 --> 02:02:43.687
When the chimes end,
pick up your gun.

02:02:43.759 --> 02:02:46.125
Try and shoot me, Colonel.

02:02:48.764 --> 02:02:50.788
Just try.

02:04:45.880 --> 02:04:48.281
Very careless of you, old man.

02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:16.136
Try this.

02:05:23.285 --> 02:05:25.219
>Now we start.

02:07:15.864 --> 02:07:17.162
Bravo.

02:07:58.741 --> 02:08:01.335
There seems to be
a family resemblance.

02:08:07.715 --> 02:08:09.308
Here.

02:08:13.956 --> 02:08:16.947
>Naturally, between
brother and sister.

02:08:17.026 --> 02:08:18.617
My gun.

02:08:23.698 --> 02:08:24.961
My boy...

02:08:26.035 --> 02:08:28.401
you've become rich.

02:08:28.470 --> 02:08:31.131
You mean we've become rich,
old man.

02:08:31.206 --> 02:08:34.265
>No, it's all for you.
I think you deserve it.

02:08:35.376 --> 02:08:37.709
What about our partnership?

02:08:40.148 --> 02:08:41.809
Maybe next time.

02:09:24.492 --> 02:09:28.724
Ten thousand, twelve thousand...

02:09:28.796 --> 02:09:30.196
fifteen...

02:09:31.265 --> 02:09:32.926
sixteen...

02:09:33.001 --> 02:09:34.299
seventeen...

02:09:36.037 --> 02:09:38.268
twenty-two...

02:09:45.714 --> 02:09:47.738
Twenty-seven.

02:09:49.417 --> 02:09:50.885
Any trouble, boy?

02:09:53.455 --> 02:09:55.046
>No, old man.

02:09:56.425 --> 02:09:59.484
Thought I was having trouble
with my adding.

02:09:59.560 --> 02:10:00.960
It's all right now.
