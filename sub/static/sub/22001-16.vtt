WEBVTT

00:01.169 --> 00:03.037
She's coming in hot.
She's The Mick.

00:03.071 --> 00:05.173
-Yaah!
-I just built that.

00:05.206 --> 00:06.407
It didn't take.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.476
Catch all-new episodes Tuesdays.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.511
And check out our other Fox
programs-- Brooklyn Nine-Nine,

00:10.544 --> 00:12.380
The Last Man on Earth and
Ghosted.

00:12.413 --> 00:14.548
I don't really know how
to do any of this stuff.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:25.126 --> 00:26.994
MICKEY:
What's going on, bud?

00:27.027 --> 00:28.429
You love spaghetti Ã  la Molng.

00:28.462 --> 00:29.997
Troy's having
a sleepover tonight,

00:30.030 --> 00:31.532
and I wasn't invited.

00:31.565 --> 00:32.900
Troy sounds like a dick.

00:32.933 --> 00:34.668
You want to have your own
sleepover and not invite him?

00:34.702 --> 00:36.670
I'll give you full access
to my movie collection.

00:36.704 --> 00:38.072
And I mean full.

00:38.106 --> 00:39.907
ALBA:
Oh. Better yet,

00:39.940 --> 00:41.709
let's invite Troy,
give him the wrong address.

00:41.742 --> 00:44.044
-You know, send him to a real
nasty part of town. -MICKEY: Oh.

00:44.078 --> 00:45.546
-Okay.
-BEN: There's no one to invite.

00:45.579 --> 00:49.250
Troy invited every boy in class
except me.

00:49.283 --> 00:50.951
-What?
-ALBA: Okay.

00:50.984 --> 00:53.053
No big deal.
We have our own fun.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.555
I'm sorry,
that's a very big deal.

00:54.588 --> 00:56.424
Number one, it's extremely rude;

00:56.457 --> 00:59.093
number two, uh, this is where
friendships are forged.

00:59.127 --> 01:02.130
Yeah. You get cut now,
you're never coming back.

01:02.163 --> 01:03.964
Okay, I think you are
overreacting, no?

01:03.997 --> 01:05.966
I think maybe
you're underreacting.

01:05.999 --> 01:09.069
When I was a kid, my friends
and I 86'd Marissa Fetter

01:09.103 --> 01:10.571
because she got boobs
before we did.

01:10.604 --> 01:13.107
-Guess where she is now.
-Hooking? -Dead?

01:14.408 --> 01:15.743
She's a dentist.

01:15.776 --> 01:17.211
Don't dentists make
a lot of money?

01:17.245 --> 01:19.113
That is not the point.
She has to spend her entire day

01:19.147 --> 01:21.949
rooting around inside
other people's mouths. Gross.

01:21.982 --> 01:23.384
What am I gonna do?

01:23.417 --> 01:24.585
This is what we're gonna do.

01:24.618 --> 01:25.986
You go get your jammies on.

01:26.019 --> 01:27.921
-You're going to a sleepover
tonight. -Come on.

01:27.955 --> 01:29.923
(Jimmy chuckles)

01:29.957 --> 01:31.559
Troy.

01:31.592 --> 01:32.993
And did you check the jacket
you wore last night?

01:33.026 --> 01:34.094
Maybe it's in there.

01:34.128 --> 01:35.629
It's not. I checked everywhere.

01:35.663 --> 01:37.498
Well, they're not gonna
let you in without an ID.

01:37.531 --> 01:39.467
I don't know what you want me
to do. It's not here.

01:39.500 --> 01:41.835
Well, maybe Kelsey
can pass hers back.

01:41.869 --> 01:43.971
Yeah, okay. They're gonna
believe that I look like that?

01:44.004 --> 01:45.406
I don't know.

01:45.439 --> 01:46.807
Maybe you guys
should just go without me.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.442
No, we can't go without you.

01:48.476 --> 01:50.744
Seriously, it's fine.
I can just chill at home.

01:50.778 --> 01:52.780
-No, I mean we literally cannot
get in without you. -Yeah.

01:52.813 --> 01:54.915
Fuji put your name on the list.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.751
Okay, well, I-I don't know
what to tell you; it's not here.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.019
Well, just keep looking, okay?

01:59.052 --> 02:00.254
We're not missing tonight.

02:00.288 --> 02:02.256
Okay, I get it!

02:02.290 --> 02:03.924
You hearing what I'm hearing?

02:03.957 --> 02:05.426
Sabrina lost her fake.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.528
Ah, I know.
It's like, call off the search,

02:07.561 --> 02:08.862
just get naked already.

02:08.896 --> 02:10.764
Dude, that's your sister.

02:10.798 --> 02:13.100
All right, whatever. I won't
look at that part of the screen.

02:13.133 --> 02:15.436
You're missing the point.
I can make her an ID

02:15.469 --> 02:17.004
just like the ones I made us.

02:17.037 --> 02:19.139
No way. I'm not doing her
any favors.

02:19.173 --> 02:21.609
No, dude, we can use it
as leverage

02:21.642 --> 02:23.611
to force them to hang with us.

02:23.644 --> 02:26.113
Oh, snap.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.848
Wait, that... that could just
take our siblingship

02:27.881 --> 02:29.550
to the next level.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.819
We could be as tight
as the frickin' Gyllenhaals.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.221
Damn, son, you scandalous, huh?

02:38.025 --> 02:39.660
Troy's mom?

02:39.693 --> 02:41.829
-Hi, can I help you?
-Well, I certainly hope so.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.031
Um, I'm not sure how involved
you were with creating

02:44.064 --> 02:45.499
the guest list for tonight,

02:45.533 --> 02:48.836
but, uh, my nephew Ben Pemberton
got excluded.

02:48.869 --> 02:52.340
Oh, no, I am so sorry
about that.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.342
I bet you are, seeing as how
he was the only boy

02:54.375 --> 02:55.876
in the class not invited.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.811
Well, right, I...
and I feel horrible...

02:57.845 --> 02:59.647
-Do you? -...but you know,
Troy made the guest list,

02:59.680 --> 03:01.815
-and I just invited everybody
on it. So you know... -Oh.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.917
-and I wasn't expecting you...
-Me to call you out on it.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.986
(laughs):
Oh, no! That's not even what...

03:06.019 --> 03:07.421
No, you know what? You don't
have to explain yourself to me.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.823
I would love for you to explain
yourself to him though.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.426
-Uh... oh.
-I just don't feel like

03:12.460 --> 03:14.061
breaking a little boy's
heart today.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.031
All right, buddy.
Have the best time.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.000
Don't screw this up.
It's gonna be such a blast.

03:20.033 --> 03:21.435
Remember, if everybody's
doing something,

03:21.469 --> 03:23.737
-you do it, too.
-But what if I don't like it?

03:23.771 --> 03:25.439
We'll figure out whether or not
you like it tomorrow.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.408
Okay. You know what?
Just be yourself, all right?

03:27.441 --> 03:29.176
They're gonna love you.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.680
And if they don't,
pop this bad boy in.

03:32.713 --> 03:34.915
Simon Birch?

03:34.948 --> 03:36.550
It's a decoy. You'll see.

03:36.584 --> 03:37.785
Now, go get 'em, tiger.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.221
Come on.

03:41.255 --> 03:42.756
-(knocking on door)
-Go away!

03:42.790 --> 03:44.258
-Hey, Sabrina.
-(Sabrina groans)

03:44.292 --> 03:46.093
Oh, sorry.
Didn't know you had company.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.796
-Yeah, you did. -Amanda, Kelsey.
Nice to see you again.

03:48.829 --> 03:51.131
-Have we met?
-No.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.866
No, but I... but, you know,
I've seen you around.

03:52.900 --> 03:54.902
Chip, you're making everybody
uncomfortable.

03:54.935 --> 03:56.737
Get the hell out of my room!

03:56.770 --> 03:58.806
-We can make you fake IDs.
-What?

03:58.839 --> 04:01.609
Yeah. My boy makes sick
fake IDs. You guys need one?

04:01.642 --> 04:03.911
(sighs) You have got to stop
spying on me, dude.

04:03.944 --> 04:05.212
What? No. We-we weren't spying.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.647
We were just... He made a batch,

04:06.680 --> 04:08.115
and we were trying
to be neighborly,

04:08.148 --> 04:09.783
but if you don't need them...

04:09.817 --> 04:11.285
Let me see it.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.725
"Chaz Pembrose,
6969 Park Avenue,

04:17.758 --> 04:20.994
born 6/9/69"?

04:21.028 --> 04:22.796
Chip, this makes you
48 years old.

04:22.830 --> 04:24.432
Eh, but nobody's really doing
the math on that.

04:24.465 --> 04:25.999
That's the only thing
they're doing.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.268
Wait, this one's even worse.
"Jaden Smith"?

04:28.302 --> 04:30.237
-What are you guys thinking?
-Okay, you know what?

04:30.270 --> 04:31.572
Just... forget it.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.407
Girls, have a nice night.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.675
Uh...
(sighs)

04:34.708 --> 04:35.909
Do they scan?

04:35.943 --> 04:38.011
Of course they scan.

04:38.045 --> 04:40.013
My boy's like frickin' Snowden.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.315
Okay, how much?

04:41.349 --> 04:42.950
Ladies, please.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.418
We don't want your money, we...

04:44.452 --> 04:45.786
we just want your company.

04:45.819 --> 04:47.355
-Gross. -What? -Ew.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.489
No, no, no, no.
Not like that. No.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.990
We just want to go
to the club with you guys.

04:50.023 --> 04:52.092
Chip, we can't be seen

04:52.125 --> 04:54.027
in public with you.
You have to know that.

04:54.061 --> 04:56.864
Okay, we'll just send you guys
pictures from the dance floor.

04:56.897 --> 04:58.966
-Oh, come on. -Just do it.
-Yeah, okay, fine.

04:58.999 --> 05:00.200
Deal.

05:00.233 --> 05:02.035
You won't regret this.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.037
Yeah, I already do.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.073
(phone vibrating)

05:09.377 --> 05:10.544
Hello?

05:10.578 --> 05:11.645
BEN:
Mickey.

05:11.679 --> 05:13.146
I had an accident.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.281
Were you driving?

05:14.314 --> 05:15.683
-What?
-Hmm?

05:15.716 --> 05:16.817
Who is this?

05:16.850 --> 05:18.619
It's Ben.

05:18.652 --> 05:19.953
Ben?

05:19.987 --> 05:21.989
Why are you calling me so late?

05:22.022 --> 05:23.524
I peed my bed.

05:23.557 --> 05:25.559
Oh, come on, man.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.528
I-I stuck my neck out for you.

05:27.561 --> 05:28.729
This is your move?

05:28.762 --> 05:30.364
I was nervous.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.732
(groans)
Well...

05:31.765 --> 05:33.367
way to respond
to pressure, buddy.

05:33.401 --> 05:35.736
-Is this bad?
-It's not good.

05:35.769 --> 05:36.970
Oh, who is that?

05:37.004 --> 05:38.338
Ben peed the bed.

05:38.372 --> 05:39.873
Oh, that's it.

05:39.907 --> 05:41.675
He might as well take a dump
on the front lawn.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.477
-He's a goner.
-Mickey.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.746
-What do I do?
-Just sit tight, okay?

05:45.779 --> 05:47.415
I'm on my way.
Don't wake anybody up.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.649
Definitely don't pee anymore.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.983
Please hurry.

05:50.017 --> 05:51.051
Yes. I'm coming.

05:51.084 --> 05:52.720
Okay, let's go. I will drive.

05:52.753 --> 05:54.855
-Where did you come from?
-I was listening in.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.758
What?! Again? Alba,
come on, you can't do that!

05:57.791 --> 05:59.427
You can't listen in. Stop.

05:59.460 --> 06:02.763
-Why, uh, were you having sex
or something? -No. -No.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.197
-Okay, what's the problem, then?
-I don't have time for this.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.033
Let's just go, all right?
As soon as we get home,

06:06.066 --> 06:08.235
-we're talking about boundaries.
-Shotgun.

06:14.374 --> 06:17.377
-Shh! Shh.
-(whispers): Geez.

06:17.411 --> 06:18.912
(whispering):
Okay.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.548
So what is our
mission objective?

06:20.581 --> 06:21.949
There is no mission.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.617
We're not forming a ninja gang.

06:23.651 --> 06:26.420
We're delivering dry sheets
and pajamas to a child.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.021
Okay, then, that would be
our mission objective.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.356
-What's my role in this?
-I-I don't know.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.624
Can you stop asking questions?

06:30.658 --> 06:32.359
We'll just figure it out
as we go.

06:32.392 --> 06:33.794
Psst. Aunt Mickey, up here.

06:33.827 --> 06:36.263
Hey, buddy.
Hey, I got dry PJs for you.

06:36.296 --> 06:38.365
Go ahead and toss me down
your wet ones.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.900
-(yelps, spits)
-Oh...

06:39.933 --> 06:41.101
Oh, no.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.269
Where's the heads-up?

06:42.302 --> 06:43.637
Sorry.

06:43.671 --> 06:45.873
It's cool. Okay.
Here come the dry ones.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.108
-Oh, no! No, no, no!
-Oh! -Ooh!

06:48.141 --> 06:50.544
Get it off me!
They're wet! (spits)

06:50.578 --> 06:52.212
Sorry again.

06:52.245 --> 06:53.481
I think those are the sheets.

06:53.514 --> 06:55.148
Oh, you think so? You think so?

06:55.182 --> 06:56.617
Don't throw anything else, okay?

06:56.650 --> 06:58.819
You ready?

06:58.852 --> 07:00.488
(grunts)

07:02.623 --> 07:04.391
You should've let me throw it.

07:04.424 --> 07:06.126
Yeah.

07:07.495 --> 07:10.197
(grunts)
There we go.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.600
Okay...

07:14.201 --> 07:15.836
(sighs)

07:15.869 --> 07:17.137
(whispering):
Okay.

07:17.170 --> 07:19.406
Put on the fresh PJs.

07:19.439 --> 07:22.476
Flip the mattress, change
the sheets, go back to sleep.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.145
I can't flip the mattress
by myself.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.349
You're lucky you're cute,
because you're useless.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.618
Move.

07:33.386 --> 07:35.188
Here we go.

07:35.222 --> 07:38.559
God, man, you really
weighed this thing down.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.929
(gasps)

07:41.962 --> 07:43.597
Wha...?

07:43.631 --> 07:45.432
You peed through
the whole thing?

07:45.465 --> 07:46.867
How is that even possible?

07:46.900 --> 07:48.468
I didn't mean to.

07:48.502 --> 07:51.939
Well, this changes things.
Stay there.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.107
Guys, psst!

07:54.141 --> 07:56.544
The mattress is toast.
He peed straight through it.

07:56.577 --> 07:58.178
-No!
-He cleared the whole thing?

07:58.211 --> 08:00.380
Yeah. We need to find
a new one now.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.515
I'm on it.

08:01.549 --> 08:02.950
Wait, where are you
going to find

08:02.983 --> 08:04.117
a new mattress at this hour?

08:04.151 --> 08:05.553
Oh, I didn't say it'd be new.

08:05.586 --> 08:08.255
Come on, climb up here.
Come on up.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.701
(knocking on door)

08:20.734 --> 08:22.402
Y'all ready to get crunk?

08:22.435 --> 08:24.237
Boom. Let's ride, chicken heads.

08:24.271 --> 08:26.073
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

08:26.106 --> 08:28.576
What are you wearing? You guys
look like complete douche bags.

08:28.609 --> 08:31.244
Eh, agree to disagree, but we'll
talk about this in the limo.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.880
Okay. You are out of your mind

08:32.913 --> 08:34.715
if you think we're
showing up in a limo.

08:34.748 --> 08:36.149
Well, then you're
out of your mind

08:36.183 --> 08:38.852
-if you think you're showing up
at all. -Okay, just...

08:38.886 --> 08:41.154
relax. We just need
to make some adjustments

08:41.188 --> 08:42.489
to whatever the hell this is.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.025
Eh. No, this outfit's fire.

08:46.393 --> 08:49.329
Would you guys ever hook up
with-- let me rephrase that.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.566
Would you guys ever speak
to a guy dressed like this?

08:52.600 --> 08:54.668
-(chuckles) God, no.
-Not a chance. -Yeah.

08:54.702 --> 08:56.069
Listen.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.038
You're silently
screaming out for help.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.573
I can see it, okay?

08:59.607 --> 09:02.776
So just let me help you.
Okay? Come on.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.846
-Y-You promise I'll look dope?
-I promise.

09:05.879 --> 09:08.916
I'll be whoever
you want me to be.

09:20.427 --> 09:23.897
Oh, yeah. That'll do.

09:23.931 --> 09:26.199
Ay. O-Okay. It's a little higher
than I thought.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.201
-Yeah, yeah, but you're fine,
just don't look down. -Okay.

09:28.235 --> 09:29.436
Get over here.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.539
Okay.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.808
(grunts) Oh, geez.

09:34.842 --> 09:36.810
Can you pull
a little bit harder?

09:36.844 --> 09:39.546
Oh, you're one to talk with
your skinny little puppet arms.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.782
-(grunts)
-Yes, yes, Alba.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.555
(snoring)

09:48.588 --> 09:51.191
(grunting)

09:52.760 --> 09:55.362
Check that one. Check that one.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.004
-No?
-No? Okay.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.439
Okay, shh, shh. Nobody panic.
Nobody panic. All right, here.

10:06.473 --> 10:08.175
Look. (grunts)

10:08.208 --> 10:10.010
It's okay. It's okay.
It's all right.

10:10.043 --> 10:11.745
I got this.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.647
-(line ringing)
-JIMMY: What?

10:13.681 --> 10:15.448
What the hell
is taking you so long?

10:15.482 --> 10:17.584
Hey, I'm doing
the best I can, okay?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.452
I took the hard job.
You don't hear me complaining.

10:19.486 --> 10:20.954
So I'll be there when I'm there.

10:40.908 --> 10:43.510
Oh... (yelps)

10:47.347 --> 10:48.682
That's not good.

10:48.716 --> 10:50.450
So what are we gonna do now?

10:50.483 --> 10:52.052
Well, we're not
gonna panic, are we?

10:52.085 --> 10:54.187
No, um...

10:54.221 --> 10:55.956
You know what we're gonna do?

10:55.989 --> 10:58.058
-Hmm?
-We're just gonna jump.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.492
Are you nuts?

10:59.526 --> 11:01.729
Do you want to spend the whole
night up here on this roof?

11:01.762 --> 11:03.530
Oh, okay, fine.

11:03.563 --> 11:06.099
Y-You jump off first without
dying, and then I will follow.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.870
Okay.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.874
Yeah, that's not gonna happen.

11:13.907 --> 11:17.344
No. (sighs)

11:17.377 --> 11:21.048
Unless... we've got something
to break our fall.

11:21.081 --> 11:22.916
You see, th-this
is the thing about me

11:22.950 --> 11:24.918
that nobody gives me credit for.

11:24.952 --> 11:27.821
I am a problem solver. Right?

11:27.855 --> 11:29.089
(grunts)

11:35.695 --> 11:36.864
Hmm.

11:36.897 --> 11:39.432
Okay. Go on.

11:39.466 --> 11:41.101
-Yup.
-What are you waiting for?

11:41.134 --> 11:43.003
I-I thought you said
it was no big deal?

11:43.036 --> 11:45.372
No, it's a big deal, you know,
'cause I'm jumping off a roof.

11:45.405 --> 11:46.606
Oh, okay.

11:48.776 --> 11:53.046
-(squeals, groans)
-ALBA: Ay!

11:53.080 --> 11:54.381
You okay?

11:54.414 --> 11:57.751
(groans) Yeah.

11:57.785 --> 12:01.388
It was actually pretty fun.
You're gonna love it.

12:01.421 --> 12:04.024
No. No, thank you.
I sleep up here tonight.

12:04.057 --> 12:06.960
Got your mattress, Mick.
So you know what that means.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.896
That means, when we get home,

12:08.929 --> 12:11.899
you going right downtown,

12:11.932 --> 12:14.234
because I am the mayor.

12:14.267 --> 12:16.970
-(Mickey gasps)
-(yells)

12:21.674 --> 12:25.078
Ooh. (gasping)

12:25.112 --> 12:26.646
Oh, my God.

12:26.679 --> 12:28.281
-Mick, are you okay?
-Yeah.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.317
I'm okay.

12:30.350 --> 12:32.752
That could be a problem.

12:35.956 --> 12:37.724
Well, now what are we gonna do?

12:37.757 --> 12:39.426
That's a lot worse
than a pee stain.

12:39.459 --> 12:40.894
Nah, it's not so bad.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.930
It could be any number
of brown things,

12:42.963 --> 12:46.934
-like chocolate or chili...
-Diarrhea.

12:48.368 --> 12:49.769
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

12:49.803 --> 12:51.504
Yeah. I hadn't thought
of that one.

12:51.538 --> 12:53.606
-This is definitely worse.
-ALBA: Uh, come on, way worse.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.607
In the morning,

12:54.641 --> 12:56.309
Ben is going to have
a new nickname:

12:56.343 --> 12:58.078
"Brown Ben,"
"Ben the Butt..."

12:58.111 --> 13:00.247
All right, we only have a couple
hours until the sun comes up.

13:00.280 --> 13:03.016
Can we just not waste it
by brainstorming poop nicknames?

13:03.050 --> 13:04.451
I don't know. This could work.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.686
I mean, Ben has some real
plausible deniability here.

13:06.719 --> 13:09.156
Diarrhea has a very
specific scent.

13:09.189 --> 13:11.291
This mattress will not
pass the smell test.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.360
No, k-kids don't care
about logic.

13:13.393 --> 13:15.128
To an eight-year-old,
brown equals diarrhea.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.463
That's-that's a fact.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.331
All right, take it easy, okay?
I'm just trying to help.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.799
Well, you're not doing
a very good job.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.634
Do you have any idea what I went
through to get this mattress?

13:21.668 --> 13:22.702
What have you two done?

13:22.735 --> 13:25.338
-You hit me with a car.
-I am stuck on a roof.

13:25.372 --> 13:28.341
"Oh, you just hit me with
your car. I'm on a roof." Okay.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.844
Need I remind you, there is
a scared little boy up there

13:30.878 --> 13:32.312
and he is staring
down the barrel

13:32.345 --> 13:33.881
of four years of dental school.

13:33.914 --> 13:35.883
Maybe he'll get lucky
and another boy will pee the bed

13:35.916 --> 13:37.684
and-and then Ben won't be
the only loser.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.519
H-Hold on a second.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.288
What if it's not
just one other boy?

13:41.321 --> 13:42.856
What if they all wet their beds?

13:42.890 --> 13:45.959
Come on, Mick.
100% saturation, not a chance.

13:45.993 --> 13:47.660
Well, you leave that to me.

13:47.694 --> 13:49.529
First things first, help me
get this mattress inside.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.698
All right.

13:53.934 --> 13:55.235
What-what are you do...
what are you doing?

13:55.268 --> 13:57.170
I'm gonna break the window
so we can get back in.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.471
You can't just smash a window.

13:58.505 --> 14:00.073
Don't you think that'll
raise a few questions?

14:00.107 --> 14:01.408
Ah, well, you find
a dead squirrel

14:01.441 --> 14:02.575
and throw it in there after.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.677
Why would a squirrel
smash through the window?

14:04.711 --> 14:06.479
I don't know, maybe 'cause
it's a flying squirrel.

14:06.513 --> 14:09.016
And where are we gonna find
a dead flying squirrel?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.550
You don't have to.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.552
You just find a squirrel
and a bird,

14:12.585 --> 14:14.021
then you glue them together.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.855
No one knows what
a flying squirrel looks like.

14:15.889 --> 14:19.559
Well, I know it doesn't look
like a bird glued to a squirrel.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.594
Hey, guys. Get in here.

14:21.628 --> 14:25.198
Huh, that'll work, too.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.868
Hate to admit it,
but Sabrina was right.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.437
We look certified fresh.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.272
We're about to get so much tang,
it's ridiculous.

14:32.305 --> 14:35.208
All right, let's bounce, ladies.
Tang Twins are ready to go.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.845
Oh, no.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.914
Where'd they go?

14:40.948 --> 14:43.616
The IDs.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.186
Damn it.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.721
-They ditched us?
-That bitch.

14:48.755 --> 14:51.024
(all laughing)

14:51.058 --> 14:52.926
Your brother is such a loser.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.928
-How are you guys even related?
-Okay,

14:54.962 --> 14:56.964
relax, okay? We're only half--
different dads.

14:56.997 --> 14:58.431
-Oh, that makes sense.
-Yeah.

14:58.465 --> 15:00.433
(phone rings)

15:00.467 --> 15:02.202
Speak of the devil.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.903
Oh, hey, baby bro.

15:03.937 --> 15:05.973
Hey, Sabrina. Where'd you go?

15:06.006 --> 15:07.774
Well, it occurred to us
that showing up to the club

15:07.807 --> 15:09.642
with you guys would be
the most humiliating experience

15:09.676 --> 15:12.145
of our lives, so we just decided
to leave you behind.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.114
And you know what?
I feel like I was way too hard

15:14.147 --> 15:15.482
on the limo thing earlier.

15:15.515 --> 15:18.051
It is super douchey,
but we're very comfortable.

15:18.085 --> 15:20.087
That's so great. I'm so glad
you like it, Sabrina.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.590
Oh, or should I say
"Harriet Tubman"?

15:23.623 --> 15:24.891
What?

15:24.924 --> 15:26.293
Check the ID.

15:26.326 --> 15:27.927
* Yeah *

15:27.961 --> 15:29.762
* And, girl, it's okay... *

15:29.796 --> 15:31.898
(Sabrina gasps)
Oh...

15:31.931 --> 15:33.466
You son of a bitch.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.601
We'll be outside.

15:38.972 --> 15:40.740
Welcome back, ladies.

15:40.773 --> 15:43.143
Do you have the ID?

15:43.176 --> 15:45.979
I do, but I'm gonna hang onto it
till we hit the club.

15:46.013 --> 15:48.015
You understand.

15:53.020 --> 15:54.921
You guys mind
if I smoke a cigar in here?

15:54.954 --> 15:56.990
SABRINA:
Yes.

15:58.225 --> 15:59.926
JIMMY:
Okay.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.195
MICKEY:
Okay.

16:04.197 --> 16:06.033
All right. What's the plan?

16:06.066 --> 16:07.467
Easy.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.802
We're gonna pee
all over these kids.

16:09.836 --> 16:12.439
Um, Mick,
I want to be a team player,

16:12.472 --> 16:14.707
but my stream
isn't what it used to be.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.543
I'm not talking
about you, creep.

16:16.576 --> 16:19.379
Okay, Ben, you ready
to do what you do best?

16:19.412 --> 16:22.815
*

16:22.849 --> 16:24.951
* I've been beat up
my whole life *

16:24.984 --> 16:28.355
* I've been shot down,
kicked out twice *

16:28.388 --> 16:30.323
* Ain't no stoppin' me tonight *

16:30.357 --> 16:31.858
* I'm-a get all the things
I like *

16:31.891 --> 16:33.960
* I've been beat up
my whole life *

16:33.993 --> 16:36.563
* I've been shot down,
kicked out twice *

16:36.596 --> 16:38.198
* Ain't no stoppin' me tonight *

16:38.231 --> 16:41.568
* I'm-a get all the things
I like *

16:41.601 --> 16:43.370
* My ... takin' over *

16:43.403 --> 16:45.205
* Brockhampton, call your mama *

16:45.238 --> 16:47.574
Hey, go back to bed,
or I'll kill you.

16:47.607 --> 16:50.910
* Break neck,
send you to the doctor *

16:50.943 --> 16:52.412
* Best boy band
since One Direction *

16:52.445 --> 16:54.547
* Makin' ... itch
like a skin infection *

16:54.581 --> 16:56.183
* Did me wrong
like a perfect stepson *

16:56.216 --> 16:58.918
* Been a wrong,
you can change the song, hun *

16:58.951 --> 17:01.088
* Who got me riled up? *

17:01.121 --> 17:03.323
* Who the lame ...
want to talk 'bout us? *

17:03.356 --> 17:05.058
* Ooh, who got me riled up? *

17:05.092 --> 17:07.227
* Who the lame ...
want to talk 'bout us? *

17:07.260 --> 17:09.729
* Ooh, come get it from me *

17:09.762 --> 17:12.232
* Uh, come get it from me, uh *

17:12.265 --> 17:14.701
* Come get it from me,
uh, uh, uh *

17:14.734 --> 17:17.070
Shh. Shh.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.938
* Break necks,
I'm the chiropractor. *

17:18.971 --> 17:21.408
All right, buddy.
Have fun at your sleepover.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.743
We'll be back to pick you up
in about 40 minutes.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.445
Thanks, guys.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.629
You, uh, you-you girls look
really hot tonight.

17:44.464 --> 17:45.865
CHIP:
Listen, sis.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.567
Before we go pop bub
in this club,

17:47.600 --> 17:49.236
and I give you this sweet ID,

17:49.269 --> 17:51.538
I'd like to offer you a truce.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.639
(quietly):
Oh, God.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.107
I think we can both admit

17:54.141 --> 17:56.143
that you've grossly
underestimated me.

17:56.176 --> 17:58.411
And if tonight has shown us
anything after all these years,

17:58.445 --> 18:00.380
it's that we're finally
on equal footing.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.283
I just want to make sure that
when we roll up in this club,

18:03.316 --> 18:04.784
we're not going
just as brother and sister,

18:04.817 --> 18:08.054
but, you know, as...
as best friends.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.257
Now, will you be my roll dog?

18:10.290 --> 18:11.958
The Maggie to my Jake?

18:11.991 --> 18:13.793
Sure, Chip.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.762
Yeah, sure.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.097
"Chip"? Uh, I'm sorry,
I don't think I know a Chip.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.432
I-I do know a Chaz.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.000
Okay, you know what, Chaz?

18:21.033 --> 18:22.902
We're here, so how about
you just give me my ID?

18:22.935 --> 18:24.271
No problem.

18:24.304 --> 18:27.774
Uh... but first,
can I get a "what, what"?

18:27.807 --> 18:29.176
(quietly):
What, what.

18:29.209 --> 18:30.610
What was that?

18:30.643 --> 18:32.812
-What, what!
-That's my girl.

18:32.845 --> 18:35.315
Let's go party our frickin'
balls off, huh?

18:35.348 --> 18:38.084
* Oh, all of a sudden,
you're a bad ... *

18:38.117 --> 18:40.953
* Just got a fat ass
like it's magic *

18:40.987 --> 18:43.122
* And now you're trying
to shake it like ratchet *

18:43.156 --> 18:46.193
* I'm guessing they must
call you "Go, Gadget" *

18:46.226 --> 18:49.128
* Oh, all of a sudden,
you're a bad ... *

18:49.162 --> 18:51.364
* Just got a fat ass
like it's magic *

18:51.398 --> 18:54.334
* And now you're trying
to shake it like ratchet *

18:54.367 --> 18:56.303
* I'm guessing they must
call you "Go, Gadget" *

19:02.409 --> 19:03.643
* Whoo... *

19:20.260 --> 19:21.328
Dude. Those are our girls.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.395
What are you doing?

19:22.429 --> 19:23.630
Sorry, man.

19:23.663 --> 19:24.897
We're at capacity.

19:24.931 --> 19:26.999
All right, well, we got IDs.

19:27.033 --> 19:29.502
Yeah, they scan and everything.

19:29.536 --> 19:31.304
An adult would never say that.

19:31.338 --> 19:32.705
But those girls
are underage, too.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.874
Who cares?

19:34.907 --> 19:36.309
Sorry.

19:36.343 --> 19:37.844
Chaz Pembrose,

19:37.877 --> 19:41.714
I'm afraid you
and, uh, Jaden Smith...

19:41.748 --> 19:43.149
You Jaden Smith?

19:43.182 --> 19:46.152
-Yes. -Oh! Jaden Smith
in the building.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.187
-I see you, son.
Go ahead, man. Uh... -Yeah.

19:48.221 --> 19:51.090
-I'm his money manager.
-No, you're not.

19:51.123 --> 19:52.759
You know what? That's fine.
I don't need this.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.861
I got my stretch limmy waiting
and everything, so...

19:54.894 --> 19:57.163
No! No, no! Hey!

19:57.196 --> 19:59.198
(both grunting)

20:01.033 --> 20:03.403
(sighs)

20:03.436 --> 20:05.738
I'm not proud
of what happened here tonight,

20:05.772 --> 20:07.507
but we did what we needed to do.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.409
Yeah. Yeah, I've always said,
you got to break the law

20:09.442 --> 20:10.610
to do the right thing.

20:10.643 --> 20:12.078
Yeah, we did that.
We got a couple.

20:12.111 --> 20:13.380
Breaking and entering, larceny.

20:13.413 --> 20:15.047
I don't know
what they tag you with

20:15.081 --> 20:16.749
when you pee all over
a bunch of sleeping kids.

20:16.783 --> 20:17.917
Uh, that's assault.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.520
Assault, right.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.455
Oh, excuse me.

20:22.489 --> 20:25.358
-Oh, it's you.
-Hey.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.860
Troy's mom.
Top of the morning to you.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.796
It's 6:00 a.m.
What-what are you doing here?

20:29.829 --> 20:31.931
-Uh...
-Oh, we never left.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.700
Nah, we been tooling around
your roof,

20:33.733 --> 20:36.769
and all over your property
pretty much the entire night.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.405
Uh...

20:38.438 --> 20:40.039
(laughing): I'm kidding.
We're here to pick up Ben.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.874
-Can you go wake him up
for us, please? -Oh.

20:41.908 --> 20:43.810
Actually, they're already up,
they... It's weird.

20:43.843 --> 20:45.978
They all wet their beds
last night.

20:46.012 --> 20:47.213
-Every single one of them?
-Yeah.

20:47.246 --> 20:48.648
-That's really strange.
-Weird.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.217
What'd you, feed them all soup?
(laughs)

20:51.250 --> 20:53.986
-Aunt Mickey, guess what,
guess what, guess what. -What?

20:54.020 --> 20:55.988
We're all gonna pee
at Aiden's house next weekend.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.924
-Are you serious?
-Yeah, they-they were all

20:57.957 --> 20:59.292
pretty upset at first, but then,

20:59.326 --> 21:01.728
Ben insisted
they were "pee brothers"?

21:01.761 --> 21:03.963
A-And they seemed to have
really bonded over it, so...

21:03.996 --> 21:05.432
That is terrific.

21:05.465 --> 21:06.933
-Pee brothers. I like that.
-Yeah.

21:06.966 --> 21:08.568
Good job, buddy.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.169
All right, let's go.
What do you say to Troy's mom?

21:10.202 --> 21:12.405
Thanks for letting us pee
in your house.

21:12.439 --> 21:14.173
-Oh. You're welcome.
-Good boy.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.743
Hop on in.

21:16.776 --> 21:17.944
-Watch those piggies.
-(car doors closing)

21:17.977 --> 21:20.112
Such a strange family.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.004
JIMMY: Go back to bed,
or I'll kill you.

21:45.037 --> 21:47.006

21:51.310 --> 21:53.546
Now here are a few more shows
to check out from Fox.

21:55.415 --> 21:57.950
