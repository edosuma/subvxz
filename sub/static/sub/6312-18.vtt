00:01.600 --> 00:02.669
Previously on Elementary:
Uh, we're here to
see Fiona Helbron,

00:02.700 --> 00:04.327
aka Mittens.

00:04.370 --> 00:05.792
FIONA:
They say autism is a spectrum,

00:05.830 --> 00:08.628
but it's really an array
of different conditions

00:08.670 --> 00:09.762
all lumped together.

00:09.810 --> 00:12.074
I prefer the term
"neuroatypical."

00:12.110 --> 00:15.409
The day Phil was arrested,
you walked me home, we talked.

00:15.440 --> 00:17.044
And I liked it.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.539
Can we do it again?

00:20.680 --> 00:22.181
I'm different, too.

00:22.220 --> 00:23.812
From other women you've dated.

00:23.850 --> 00:25.818
It takes a little
more work with me.

00:25.850 --> 00:27.750
I know that
because I've heard it

00:27.790 --> 00:29.724
from both my
previous boyfriends.

00:29.760 --> 00:31.125
I'm a little afraid.

00:31.160 --> 00:33.219
I'm a little afraid, too.

00:38.370 --> 00:40.691
*

00:40.740 --> 00:42.105
What?

00:42.140 --> 00:43.801
I was just marveling
at how you were able

00:43.840 --> 00:46.536
to sleep so soundly last night,
given the incessant sex noise.

00:46.580 --> 00:48.502
I didn't hear any sex noise.

00:48.540 --> 00:49.848
Through the wall
from next door.

00:49.880 --> 00:52.178
Trent and his new lover,

00:52.220 --> 00:53.812
putting the devil into hell
even as we speak.

00:53.850 --> 00:56.842
We just paid to have
his entire place soundproofed.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.414
Not well enough, apparently.

00:58.450 --> 01:00.156
Oh, you're crazy.

01:00.190 --> 01:01.657
Am I?

01:01.690 --> 01:03.624
So, Trent has a new girlfriend.

01:03.660 --> 01:05.753
You have a new girlfriend.
Why is this a problem?

01:05.790 --> 01:07.121
'Cause it's their fourth night

01:07.160 --> 01:08.457
of marathon activity
in the last week.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.797
It's distracting.

01:09.830 --> 01:11.366
Quiet is indispensable
to my process.

01:11.400 --> 01:12.469
How do you not hear it?

01:12.500 --> 01:14.138
Just luclq I guess.

01:14.170 --> 01:15.660
Perhaps it entered
your mind unconsciously.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.339
Were your dreams filled with two
flounders slapping together?

01:18.370 --> 01:21.168
A ketchup bottle being
squeezed repeatedly

01:21.210 --> 01:23.269
whilst a nearby walrus
issues a death rattle?

01:23.310 --> 01:24.379
Okay, I get it.

01:24.410 --> 01:26.378
I assure you, you do not.

01:33.260 --> 01:34.784
Don't.
Don't what?

01:34.820 --> 01:37.653
Mess with him.
I'm serious.

01:37.690 --> 01:39.351
No chain saw art in the study,

01:39.400 --> 01:41.356
no marching bands
in the library.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.198
He's a nice guy, and we've just
convinced him to move back in.

01:44.230 --> 01:46.232
Not promising anything.

01:46.270 --> 01:48.192
If uprooting Trent
is the price of justice,

01:48.240 --> 01:49.639
history will be
on our side.

01:49.670 --> 01:51.206
Finish your coffee
and get dressed.

01:51.240 --> 01:52.229
While you slumbered

01:52.280 --> 01:53.474
we received a call.

01:53.510 --> 01:55.205
_ Potential client
IS on hIS way here.

01:56.780 --> 01:59.248
(door closing)

02:01.180 --> 02:04.741
HOLMES:
Must confess,
Mr. Springer, your call

02:04.790 --> 02:06.382
took us by surprise.

02:06.420 --> 02:08.479
We wouldn't have expected you
to request our services.

02:08.520 --> 02:11.819
Why? Because you put two of my
partners behind bars last month?

02:11.860 --> 02:15.626
Not the sort of thing
that tends to win us fans.

02:15.660 --> 02:17.594
It worked out in my favor.

02:17.630 --> 02:19.166
So they didn't commit a murder,

02:19.200 --> 02:20.929
so much as provide you
a murder-tunity.

02:20.970 --> 02:22.733
Are you okay?

02:22.770 --> 02:24.806
He'll be fine.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.276
This is my son Brian.
He's the reason I called.

02:28.310 --> 02:31.347
And you're right,
I don't like you.

02:31.380 --> 02:32.608
But you're the best.

02:32.650 --> 02:34.515
And this has nothing
to do with my firm.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.946
Missing Persons case.

02:37.990 --> 02:40.208
A doctor named
Vincent Bader.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.909
No one's seen him
for srx days.

02:41.960 --> 02:43.825
That's everything the cops have.

02:43.860 --> 02:44.952
And you came
in possession

02:44.990 --> 02:46.628
of a police file how?

02:46.660 --> 02:48.491
Let's just say
the firm's security team

02:48.530 --> 02:50.691
has its share
of retired detectives.

02:50.730 --> 02:52.288
Oh.

02:52.340 --> 02:54.467
Pain management specialist,
he co-owns

02:54.500 --> 02:56.206
a center near Lenox Hill.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.468
And what's your interest in him?

02:57.510 --> 02:59.205
Minimal.

02:59.240 --> 03:01.299
Brian's a patient,
you'll see that in the file.

03:03.280 --> 03:04.542
So you're a person of interest

03:04.580 --> 03:05.604
in the doctor's
disappearance.

03:05.650 --> 03:07.311
There was
an altercation

03:07.350 --> 03:08.874
outside his office

03:08.920 --> 03:11.411
two days before he went missing
and threats were overheard?

03:11.450 --> 03:13.281
Tell them.

03:14.990 --> 03:16.753
I never did
anything to him.

03:16.790 --> 03:18.451
I was just mad.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.923
SPRINGER:
The kid's never even
hit a baseball,

03:19.960 --> 03:21.552
let alone a man.

03:21.600 --> 03:22.794
So you're going through

03:22.830 --> 03:25.594
prescription opioid
withdrawal, hmm?

03:25.630 --> 03:28.929
You were seeing a pain
specialist and now you're not.

03:28.970 --> 03:30.608
Brian's always been frail.

03:30.640 --> 03:34.531
One injury or another his
whole life, mostly back pain.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.445
WATSON:
This argument
people overheard,

03:36.480 --> 03:38.368
Dr. Bader cut you off your meds?

03:38.410 --> 03:40.810
No, I did. Bader's
the one that got him hooked.

03:40.850 --> 03:42.909
Brian was trying to get
some pills from him,

03:42.950 --> 03:46.386
despite my instructions
to the contrary.

03:46.420 --> 03:48.456
Let's get you some tea.

03:48.490 --> 03:50.526
(quietly):
Go ahead.

04:00.740 --> 04:02.332
What?

04:02.370 --> 04:04.304
Just going through my theories

04:04.340 --> 04:07.309
to the origins of your son's
chronic pain.

04:07.340 --> 04:09.342
Not that I'll ever
be able to prove it.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.348
I remember there were
a few photographs of him

04:11.380 --> 04:12.415
in your office.

04:12.450 --> 04:13.917
He was very partial to wearing

04:13.950 --> 04:16.589
long sleeves,
long trousers in warm weather.

04:16.620 --> 04:18.349
At first I didn't
think anything of it,

04:18.390 --> 04:20.551
but now I'm wondering
whether it was to hide bruises.

04:22.690 --> 04:23.918
Yes.

04:23.960 --> 04:26.895
Whatever chronic
back injury he has,

04:26.930 --> 04:29.569
it began at your hand,
did it not?

04:29.600 --> 04:31.591
There are two things
you should know,

04:31.630 --> 04:33.029
Mr. Springer.

04:33.070 --> 04:35.459
First is that I'm going
to punch you in the face.

04:36.570 --> 04:37.901
(groans)

04:37.940 --> 04:40.738
Second... is that we'll
take your case.

04:43.410 --> 04:45.401
*

05:18.550 --> 05:21.610
Vince called me from his office
Thursday afternoon.

05:21.650 --> 05:23.948
Said he was going to the gym
after work-- he has

05:23.990 --> 05:25.617
a membership
in the city.

05:25.650 --> 05:27.789
And then he had
a continuing ed dinner

05:27.820 --> 05:31.051
at a restaurant in midtown.

05:31.090 --> 05:33.797
He never made it to either.

05:33.830 --> 05:35.957
_There are two cars in the_
driveway-- IS one of them hIS?

05:36.000 --> 05:37.092
He takes the train.

05:37.130 --> 05:38.620
You said
you were hired

05:38.670 --> 05:40.137
by the father of the kid

05:40.170 --> 05:41.762
who was questioned by the cops?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.768
My inquiries are
on the young man's behalf.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.062
Is that all right?

05:46.110 --> 05:49.034
It's not like he did anything.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.399
You may be right.

05:50.450 --> 05:53.374
In my experience,
the guilty party

05:53.420 --> 05:56.071
rarely hires someone
to investigate.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.883
But, if you don't
mind me asking you,

05:57.920 --> 06:00.115
why do you think he's innocent?

06:00.160 --> 06:02.082
For a woman who's_
husband has been missmg

06:02.120 --> 06:04.122
for almost a week,
you seem rather unconcerned.

06:04.160 --> 06:07.527
That's because
I'm not concerned-- I'm angry.

06:07.560 --> 06:09.118
Vince isn't lying

06:09.160 --> 06:12.493
in a ditch somewhere,
he ran off with some redhead.

06:12.540 --> 06:14.792
Probably a patient or a nurse.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.034
Someone he met at work.

06:16.070 --> 06:17.708
And you think this because?

06:17.740 --> 06:18.729
My two girlfriends

06:18.770 --> 06:20.078
saw him buying her lunch

06:20.110 --> 06:21.202
in the city a few weeks ago.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.446
You know, looking over his
shoulder, the whole deal.

06:22.480 --> 06:26.519
They said she was so skinny they
wanted to send over a steak.

06:26.550 --> 06:28.438
I asked Vince

06:28.480 --> 06:30.710
about it-- he wouldn't
tell me who she was.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.411
So what else
am I supposed to think?

06:32.460 --> 06:34.451
You mentioned none of this

06:34.490 --> 06:36.629
when you reported him missing
to the police.

06:36.660 --> 06:39.458
IfI had, they wouldn't have
looked for him at all.

06:39.500 --> 06:42.094
My cousin's a cop.
I know how it works.

06:42.130 --> 06:44.462
You should still prepare
yourself for the worst.

06:44.500 --> 06:46.934
The details of your
husband's disappearance,

06:46.970 --> 06:48.961
and the abandonment
of his business,

06:49.000 --> 06:54.108
they don't absolutely fit the
profile of a cheating husband.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.776
There's another reason
I think that Vince is fine.

07:01.080 --> 07:03.048
Let me show you.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.164
Hmm...

07:20.200 --> 07:22.168
So, this is meant to indicate
that your husband

07:22.200 --> 07:24.134
didn't fall into harm's way
because it looks like

07:24.170 --> 07:25.728
he's planning a small invasion.

07:25.770 --> 07:27.169
Vince is a prepper.

07:27.210 --> 07:28.802
Are you familiar with the term?

07:28.840 --> 07:30.705
Yes, he's convinced
that society as we know it

07:30.750 --> 07:33.639
is on the verge of collapse
and it's his duty to be ready.

07:33.680 --> 07:35.170
I didn't care
one way or the other,

07:35.220 --> 07:36.642
as long as he didn't
blow too much money.

07:36.690 --> 07:37.748
Made him feel better.

07:37.790 --> 07:38.745
Point is, Vince is

07:38.790 --> 07:40.815
obsessed with
self-defense.

07:40.860 --> 07:42.748
He's not someone
a mugger or a kidnapper

07:42.790 --> 07:44.087
is going to get
a jump on.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.586
Don't get me wrong, though.

07:45.630 --> 07:47.894
When he turns up,
I'm going to kill him.

07:47.930 --> 07:50.262
MAN:
I don't buy it.

07:50.300 --> 07:52.188
Vince would never
cheat on Jennifer.

07:52.230 --> 07:53.868
He loves her.

07:53.900 --> 07:56.903
So the alternative is that
something happened to him.

07:56.940 --> 07:59.500
Well, that's what
I'm worried about.

07:59.540 --> 08:01.235
But, hey, I'll be
thrilled if I'm wrong.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.679
Please.

08:02.710 --> 08:04.507
So you said you were
out of the ofﬁce

08:04.550 --> 08:06.643
the day he disappeared?

08:06.680 --> 08:08.841
My girlfriend had a...
family thing

08:08.880 --> 08:10.518
on Lake Ronkonkoma.

08:10.550 --> 08:12.245
I took a long
weekend.

08:12.290 --> 08:14.656
Vince and I talked on the phone
that day-- work stuff.

08:14.690 --> 08:17.124
He seemed normal.

08:17.160 --> 08:19.549
Julie Monahan, drug rep.

08:19.600 --> 08:20.919
What about her?
Mrs. Bader mentioned

08:20.960 --> 08:23.064
something about
a redhead to my partner.

08:24.730 --> 08:26.937
Julie makes her rounds here
every month or so.

08:26.970 --> 08:28.597
She's flirty.

08:28.640 --> 08:29.959
With all the guys.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.228
Female docs, too, if it works.

08:32.270 --> 08:34.306
It's her job to be that way,
it isn't real.

08:34.340 --> 08:38.049
I never thought Vince would
have... acted on it.

08:38.080 --> 08:39.945
Do you mind
ifI hang on to this?

08:39.980 --> 08:40.844
Sure.

08:42.850 --> 08:44.317
BELL:
You know, you didn't need

08:44.350 --> 08:46.045
to bring an attorney,
Ms. Monahan.

08:46.090 --> 08:47.819
Far as we know, you're
not in any trouble.

08:47.860 --> 08:49.589
If Vincent Bader's all right,

08:49.630 --> 08:51.279
no crime has
been committed.

08:51.330 --> 08:53.548
I'm going to cut you off,
Detective. You misunderstand.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.693
Ms. Monahan didn't know
Dr. Bader was missing

08:55.730 --> 08:56.958
until you called her.

08:57.000 --> 08:58.592
Now that you did,

08:58.630 --> 08:59.995
she may have information
that could help.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.860
Whatever it is,
she's worried that

09:01.900 --> 09:04.266
it might get her in trouble,
that's why she brought you.

09:04.310 --> 09:05.607
Yes.

09:05.640 --> 09:07.107
Is whatever she did

09:07.140 --> 09:08.698
less bad than what she thinks
happened to Dr. Bader?

09:08.740 --> 09:10.571
By about
a thousand miles.

09:10.610 --> 09:12.305
All right,
I can't make any promises,

09:12.350 --> 09:14.568
but if that's true, I'm sure
Ms. Monahan's cooperation

09:14.620 --> 09:16.212
will be taken into account,

09:16.250 --> 09:18.309
and I'd throw whatever support
I could that way.

09:20.660 --> 09:24.255
A few weeks ago,
Vince came to me with a problem.

09:24.290 --> 09:26.258
He had been selling narcotics

09:26.290 --> 09:28.724
out of his practice
to drug dealers.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.091
Oxycodone,

09:30.130 --> 09:32.121
hydrocodone, morphine.

09:32.170 --> 09:34.661
He tell you the dealers' names?

09:36.300 --> 09:38.268
He told me
it started out small--

09:38.310 --> 09:41.074
he just needed to make some
extra money on the side--

09:41.110 --> 09:43.772
but then they kept wanting more

09:43.810 --> 09:47.143
and they threatened
to hurt him if he stopped.

09:47.180 --> 09:49.944
This had been
going on for months.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.309
Then he got a notification

09:51.350 --> 09:53.284
from the Bureau
of Narcotics Enforcement

09:53.320 --> 09:56.084
saying that his practice
was up for an audit.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.656
An audit?
They come
to your offices

09:57.690 --> 10:00.352
and inspect all of your
controlled substances.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.958
They check your dispensing
records,

10:02.000 --> 10:03.865
literally count
every pill.

10:03.900 --> 10:05.322
If Bader was
selling pills illegally,

10:05.370 --> 10:06.837
the count would be short.

10:06.870 --> 10:09.088
The state would launch
a full investigation.

10:09.140 --> 10:11.165
How short are we talking?

10:11.210 --> 10:14.031
Over $200,000 in pills.

10:14.080 --> 10:16.378
Vince panicked.

10:16.410 --> 10:20.312
He asked for my help and I...

10:20.350 --> 10:25.117
lent him enough inventory,
off the books,

10:25.150 --> 10:27.380
so that when
the BNE came

10:27.420 --> 10:28.785
came to do their count,

10:28.820 --> 10:30.185
everything appeared
to be in order.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.186
After that, he gave

10:32.230 --> 10:33.697
the pills back to me.

10:33.730 --> 10:35.322
He'd bought himself
the time he needed.

10:35.360 --> 10:37.294
It would be years
before another audit,

10:37.330 --> 10:39.798
_ so he could _
pad his records over time

10:39.840 --> 10:41.728
to make everything even out.

10:41.770 --> 10:43.431
Why exactly did you help him?

10:43.470 --> 10:47.702
Because it put him in her pocket
instead of the drug dealers.

10:47.740 --> 10:50.709
She earned herself
a big customer for life.

10:50.750 --> 10:53.913
After that, he swore to me

10:53.950 --> 10:56.316
that he would
break it off with the dealers.

10:56.350 --> 10:58.147
Whatever it took.

10:58.190 --> 11:02.251
If Vince is missing, I have to
think those guys are involved.

11:03.760 --> 11:05.125
Watson?

11:05.160 --> 11:06.718
Hey, where are you?

11:06.760 --> 11:09.297
Midtown. I stopped
by Vincent Bader's gym.

11:09.330 --> 11:11.321
His wife said he had
his gym bag with him

11:11.370 --> 11:12.769
the morning he disappeared.

11:12.800 --> 11:14.336
It hasn't turned up.

11:14.370 --> 11:16.736
I just verified for myself
that he never made it here.

11:16.770 --> 11:18.169
It's possible he met
with foul play

11:18.210 --> 11:19.359
between his office and here.

11:19.410 --> 11:22.436
It's also possible that he never
intended to go to the gym.

11:22.480 --> 11:24.243
The bag might have contained
extra clothes.

11:24.280 --> 11:26.407
He might not fit the profile
of a cheating husband,

11:26.450 --> 11:28.179
but he might be
a runaway husband.

11:28.220 --> 11:30.085
Especially if he recently
broke off business

11:30.120 --> 11:31.189
with drug traffickers.

11:31.220 --> 11:32.414
So you got my message.

11:32.450 --> 11:33.917
If they intended him harm,

11:33.960 --> 11:35.450
he might be on the lam.

11:35.490 --> 11:37.128
Any progress identifying them?

11:37.160 --> 11:38.855
Marcus just passed Bader's
phone records on to Narcotics.

11:38.890 --> 11:41.495
Missing Persons
already went through them,

11:41.530 --> 11:43.395
but now that we know
what we're looking for,

11:43.430 --> 11:45.398
maybe something will leap out.

11:45.430 --> 11:46.397
(doorbell buzzes)

11:46.430 --> 11:47.966
Oh, someone's at the door.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.399
Uh, I'll see you later.

11:54.480 --> 11:56.038
Fiona, hi.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.399
Uh, come on in.

11:57.450 --> 12:00.010
Is Sherlock home?

12:00.050 --> 12:01.347
No, he's out right now,

12:01.380 --> 12:03.086
but he should be back
in a little bit,

12:03.120 --> 12:04.781
if you want to wait.

12:04.820 --> 12:06.412
Do you know how soon
he'll be here?

12:06.450 --> 12:08.111
Uh, maybe 45 minutes.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.787
I'll come back another time.

12:09.830 --> 12:13.425
I prepared what I want
to say to Sherlock.

12:13.460 --> 12:14.427
I timed it,

12:14.460 --> 12:16.189
so I know how long
it'll take.

12:16.230 --> 12:17.891
And if I don't know
how long it'll take,

12:17.930 --> 12:20.091
I won't know
when I'll get back to my office

12:20.140 --> 12:22.062
or what time
I'll finish my work,

12:22.100 --> 12:24.466
and I won't like that.

12:25.910 --> 12:27.730
(door closes)

12:29.810 --> 12:31.778
(clattering)
Hey.

12:31.810 --> 12:32.970
When did you get back?

12:33.020 --> 12:34.442
Just arrived.

12:34.480 --> 12:36.812
I saw the information
Marcus sent over.

12:36.850 --> 12:39.489
Emmett Wahl.

12:39.520 --> 12:42.785
The fruit of
the narcotic squad's labor?
Yeah. They recognized

12:42.830 --> 12:44.980
a number on _Bader's
phone records right away.

12:45.030 --> 12:46.281
But it wasn't Wahl's--
it was his mother's.

12:46.330 --> 12:47.797
They have a wiretap on it.

12:47.830 --> 12:48.922
Apparently he's been
doing business

12:48.960 --> 12:50.461
out of her place
for a while now.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.389
He acquires product
for a pill trafficking group

12:53.440 --> 12:55.089
called the Silver Rail.

12:55.140 --> 12:56.801
Named after the passenger train

12:56.840 --> 12:57.966
that runs up and down
the East Coast.

12:58.010 --> 12:59.409
A reference to their territory?

12:59.440 --> 13:01.237
I would say you could
ask Wahl yourself

13:01.280 --> 13:03.009
when we talk to him,
but I wouldn't bother.

13:03.050 --> 13:04.574
He's been calling
Bader's ofﬁce every day

13:04.610 --> 13:06.498
asking for him, including today.

13:06.550 --> 13:10.088
So they don't know his
whereabouts any more than we do.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.088
What is that?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.482
Methyl mercaptan?

13:15.520 --> 13:17.329
It's the odorant added
to natural gas

13:17.360 --> 13:18.520
to provide its aroma.

13:18.560 --> 13:19.788
What's it for?

13:21.230 --> 13:23.266
Sherlock?

13:23.300 --> 13:24.528
You honestly don't hear it?

13:24.570 --> 13:26.094
What? Is Trent having sex again?

13:26.130 --> 13:27.165
He's humming.

13:27.200 --> 13:28.599
A few well-placed drops of this

13:28.640 --> 13:30.267
is enough to simulate
a gas leak.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.505
You explicitly said
"no loud noises."

13:32.540 --> 13:34.929
So evacuating him temporarily
while the city checks his home

13:34.980 --> 13:36.174
is honoring your wishes.

13:36.210 --> 13:37.609
What is going on with you?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.402
This fixation on Trent,

13:39.450 --> 13:41.338
punching Lloyd Springer
in the face?

13:41.380 --> 13:42.517
Springer deserved
more than a punch.

13:42.550 --> 13:44.211
Is something wrong

13:44.250 --> 13:46.241
between you and Fiona?

13:46.290 --> 13:48.508
Why would you ask me that?

13:48.560 --> 13:50.619
Because she came by earlier,
wanted to talk to you,

13:50.660 --> 13:52.525
but something about it
seemed odd.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.096
She's neuroatypical.

13:54.130 --> 13:55.950
Conversations with her
are often odd,

13:56.000 --> 13:58.889
at least by the standards of
those who don't know any better.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.192
You know that's not
what I meant.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.559
Odd for her.

14:01.600 --> 14:05.138
(phone ringing)

14:06.670 --> 14:08.001
Marcus?

14:08.040 --> 14:09.530
Hey, I thought you guys
would want to know

14:09.580 --> 14:10.945
Vincent Bader's body turned up.

14:10.980 --> 14:13.540
The M.E. is taking a look
right now.

14:13.580 --> 14:15.468
The body was found

14:15.520 --> 14:17.283
wrapped in tarp
and tied with rope.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.289
A couple spotted it
off a path in Forest Park.

14:20.320 --> 14:22.652
We think he was killed elsewhere
and moved there.

14:22.690 --> 14:24.123
Looks like someone
split his head open

14:24.160 --> 14:26.219
with an ax.
GRANNIS: Iagree.

14:26.260 --> 14:28.922
Sharp, heaw-blade
wedging action.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.496
But some other wounds

14:30.530 --> 14:32.122
are shallow,

14:32.170 --> 14:34.889
from an instrument
with a narrow, hooked end.

14:34.940 --> 14:36.134
Could be multiple attackers,

14:36.170 --> 14:38.502
different weapons.

14:38.540 --> 14:40.303
Or one attacker

14:40.340 --> 14:43.571
with a multi-purpose tool--

14:43.610 --> 14:45.373
something like that.

14:45.410 --> 14:47.514
It's a hatchet,
crowbar and hammer

14:47.550 --> 14:49.677
all in one, and it's popular
amongst survivalists.

14:49.720 --> 14:53.417
As are the paracord and knots
used to transport the body.

14:53.460 --> 14:56.054
I think it's possible
Vincent Bader was not killed

14:56.090 --> 14:57.648
over pain pills.

14:57.690 --> 14:59.681
You think he was killed
by a fellow prepper?

14:59.730 --> 15:01.698
The evidence
would support that.

15:01.730 --> 15:03.664
Would be ironic,
wouldn't it?

15:03.700 --> 15:05.668
_ Dr. Bader's _
fixation on survwal

15:05.700 --> 15:07.634
bringing his to an end.

15:17.410 --> 15:20.243
Our condolences on your loss.

15:20.280 --> 15:22.316
Uh...

15:22.350 --> 15:24.318
I never, um,

15:26.690 --> 15:29.011
I_knew he met a few
in person. Mostly...

15:29.060 --> 15:31.688
mostly, he just talked to them
on the discussion boards.

15:31.730 --> 15:34.654
We're gonna want to take a look
at his computer, then.

15:34.700 --> 15:36.395
Yeah, whatever you need.

15:38.430 --> 15:41.490
I mentioned a redheaded woman

15:41.540 --> 15:45.169
to the consultant
who came to see me yesterday.

15:45.210 --> 15:47.132
Yeah.
We looked into it.

15:48.380 --> 15:49.529
They weren't having an affair.

15:53.780 --> 15:57.079
Oh, uh, I don't know
if this is anything, but, uh,

15:57.120 --> 15:59.247
Vince usually
handled the money.

15:59.290 --> 16:01.281
But with him gone,
I had to look over

16:01.320 --> 16:05.120
the banking statements
last night.

16:05.160 --> 16:07.993
He spent $100,000 on something
a few months ago

16:08.030 --> 16:10.624
that he never told me about.
Maybe he kept it a secret

16:10.670 --> 16:12.422
'cause he thought
I'd be mad.

16:12.470 --> 16:15.166
It was something called
The, uh, The Keep?

16:15.200 --> 16:17.668
*

16:32.150 --> 16:34.584
That's what Bader's
$100,000 went to.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.554
The Keep.
The very pinnacle

16:36.590 --> 16:38.649
in luxury doomsday bunkers.

16:38.690 --> 16:41.158
Built inside a decommissioned
Cold War stronghold

16:41.200 --> 16:43.794
_at a secret location
just out5ide the City.

16:43.830 --> 16:45.661
Owned and operated by this man.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.237
Ronnie Wright.
Ex-Marine,

16:48.270 --> 16:50.568
survival expert, huckster.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.703
His sales pitch touts
not only the site's

16:52.740 --> 16:54.674
security, but also...

16:54.710 --> 16:57.679
the exclusivity
of its members.

16:57.710 --> 16:59.473
It is pretty swanlq.

16:59.510 --> 17:01.614
If you're keen on spending
eternity buried alive

17:01.650 --> 17:03.709
with a group so narcissistic
they think that

17:03.750 --> 17:05.547
outliving humanity
is a good idea.

17:05.590 --> 17:07.410
I'd rather melt with the masses

17:07.460 --> 17:08.586
and get it over with,
wouldn't you?

17:08.620 --> 17:10.326
It's not how I pictured
prepping. I mean,

17:10.360 --> 17:12.726
when you say "survivalists,"
I see bearded guys

17:12.760 --> 17:14.489
wearing gas masks digging holes

17:14.530 --> 17:16.088
in their backyards
to build shelters.

17:16.130 --> 17:17.768
That's the
garden-variety prepper.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.598
The Keep caters
to a uniquely vile subset:

17:20.640 --> 17:22.096
the wealthy prepper.

17:22.140 --> 17:23.539
Along with the myriad

17:23.570 --> 17:26.403
doomsday scenarios
that haunt ordinary preppers—-

17:26.440 --> 17:28.135
global pandemic,
nuclear holocaust,

17:28.180 --> 17:30.068
_socialist zombies
coming to eat their guns--

17:30.110 --> 17:32.704
the wealthy ones also worry
that the poor are gonna rise up

17:32.750 --> 17:34.479
with torches and pitchforks.

17:34.520 --> 17:35.817
Which, one could argue,

17:35.850 --> 17:37.181
wouldn't be the worst thing
in the world.

17:37.220 --> 17:39.142
So, what do you think?

17:39.190 --> 17:41.408
Does this have anything to do
with Vincent Bader's murder?

17:41.460 --> 17:43.553
Mrs. Bader was right
about him chatting online

17:43.590 --> 17:45.182
with other preppers,

17:45.230 --> 17:47.653
including much discussion
about The Keep.

17:47.700 --> 17:50.464
Dr. Bader and a few other
fortunate souls

17:50.500 --> 17:52.092
were accepted in.

17:52.130 --> 17:54.633
Many other preppers,
of course, were not.

17:54.670 --> 17:57.639
Here we find an alarming amount
of death threats

17:57.670 --> 18:00.104
from the latter to the former.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.778
So, maybe someone
who didn't get into The Keep

18:01.810 --> 18:03.573
got angry and then killed him.

18:03.610 --> 18:05.646
The anger
is almost to be expected,

18:05.680 --> 18:08.808
given the existential dread
that consumes this group.

18:08.850 --> 18:11.512
To them,
The Keep is a life raft.

18:11.550 --> 18:14.212
At the moment, all we
have are user handles.

18:14.260 --> 18:15.682
But I can think of one man

18:15.720 --> 18:17.585
who might know the name
of every single person

18:17.630 --> 18:19.518
he ever turned away.

18:19.560 --> 18:20.822
Sure, but if they're all
as paranoid

18:20.860 --> 18:22.350
as you say they are,
he's not gonna just

18:22.400 --> 18:23.662
help two police consultants.

18:23.700 --> 18:25.725
Which is why we are not
going to approach him

18:25.770 --> 18:27.328
as police consultants.

18:28.770 --> 18:31.762
I asked around about your
father after you called.

18:31.810 --> 18:33.732
I don't know how I hadn't
heard of him before.

18:33.780 --> 18:35.429
Impressive circles
he moves in.

18:35.480 --> 18:37.573
The ninth is his favorite
at this time of year.

18:37.610 --> 18:39.202
I'm sorry?

18:39.250 --> 18:41.548
My father is interested
in reserving multiple spots

18:41.580 --> 18:44.219
in The Keep, including ones
for Watson and myself.

18:44.250 --> 18:46.138
Glad to hear it.

18:46.190 --> 18:48.408
We would_need to vet
your selection process--

18:48.460 --> 18:50.485
see who you let in
and who you didn't.

18:50.530 --> 18:51.622
We would need to know
who we were

18:51.660 --> 18:53.890
bunking with. You understand.
I do,

18:53.930 --> 18:56.626
I totally get it, but I can't
give that information out

18:56.660 --> 18:58.799
to non-members.
You wouldn't want me

18:58.830 --> 19:01.333
telling the next guy
in here about you, right?

19:01.370 --> 19:03.463
Good answe_r.
Once you're in,

19:03.510 --> 19:04.704
I'll give you
every single name.

19:04.740 --> 19:06.503
We all hope it never
comes to it,

19:06.540 --> 19:08.872
but you could be living with
folks for a long time.

19:08.910 --> 19:11.708
First thing's first, though--
I'll take you to the site.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.617
Once you see it, I promise you,
you won't have any doubts.

19:14.650 --> 19:16.641
(door opens)

19:18.620 --> 19:21.350
I'm gonna need both your phones
before we go.

19:21.390 --> 19:23.688
It's to maintain the secrecy
of the location.

19:23.730 --> 19:27.291
Obviously you'll be given the
coordinates once you're members.

19:38.840 --> 19:41.707
We're off the highway now.

19:41.740 --> 19:44.504
Rail crossing.

19:44.550 --> 19:46.575
I have feeling in my
butt, too, you know.

19:46.610 --> 19:47.975
Mm.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.386
I'm cataloguing the steps
on our journey out loud

19:50.420 --> 19:52.911
to keep them clear.
It'll help me visualize

19:52.950 --> 19:55.350
where the authorities
will find our bodies.

19:55.390 --> 19:56.709
You don't really
think that they're...

20:01.730 --> 20:04.494
I'd say we were
on the LIE. for 62 miles.

20:07.770 --> 20:10.364
Things are quite good
between me and Fiona.

20:10.410 --> 20:13.379
You expressed some
concern last night.

20:13.410 --> 20:15.378
I would allow, however,

20:15.410 --> 20:18.379
that the, uh, the mechanics
of the relationship have,

20:18.410 --> 20:21.379
you know, left me in
something of a mood of late.

20:21.420 --> 20:23.012
The "mechanics"?
Yeah.

20:23.050 --> 20:25.245
We've been taking
things slow.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.951
You haven't had sex yet.
We have not.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.798
It's been challenging.

20:33.830 --> 20:37.425
I've not been "exc|_usive"
for qUIte some time.

20:37.470 --> 20:41.429
For the last few years,
sex has been, uh...

20:41.470 --> 20:44.928
a calisthenic performed
with like-minded individuals.

20:44.970 --> 20:46.767
I can't, of course,
commit to Fiona

20:46.810 --> 20:48.778
and, uh, keep up
my exercise regimen,

20:48.810 --> 20:52.405
so... it's fallen away.

20:52.450 --> 20:56.819
Yes, it's been 47 days since
my last act of sexual congress.

20:56.850 --> 20:59.819
That's a long time for you.

20:59.850 --> 21:01.454
A really long time.

21:01.490 --> 21:05.529
Yeah, well,
Fiona's... special,

21:05.560 --> 21:08.597
so I've decided to make
a speCIal effort.

21:08.630 --> 21:11.599
I actually did some research
on, uh, relationships

21:11.630 --> 21:13.598
with individuals
on the spectrum,

21:13.640 --> 21:15.835
talked to some experts
in the field.

21:15.870 --> 21:18.862
I... think she's worth it.

21:21.780 --> 21:23.771
I'm proud of you.

21:25.050 --> 21:27.439
What, I can't say that?

21:28.750 --> 21:30.445
(sighs)

21:39.660 --> 21:41.753
Right this way.

21:44.430 --> 21:47.024
Entry system works like
a safe-deposit box.

21:47.070 --> 21:49.391
Every member gets
his or her own key.

21:49.440 --> 21:51.101
My associates and I
each keep a copy

21:51.140 --> 21:52.869
of the second key
on our person

21:52.910 --> 21:54.901
at all times.
One of us is always

21:54.940 --> 21:56.771
within 30 minutes
of this spot.

21:56.810 --> 21:58.846
And we're never all together
at the same time.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.917
That way the bunker's always
secure until it's needed.

22:01.950 --> 22:04.885
And you and I can be sure that
someone will always be here

22:04.920 --> 22:06.888
to let us in when things
finally go sideways.

22:06.920 --> 22:08.888
(beeping)
Exactly.

22:08.920 --> 22:11.320
*

22:32.880 --> 22:36.748
This was a NORAD communications
center back in the '805.

22:39.850 --> 22:42.159
HOLMES:
Tested it, have you?

22:42.190 --> 22:44.658
Never mind.
If it doesn't work,

22:44.690 --> 22:46.851
we'll hardly be asking for
our money back, will we?

22:46.890 --> 22:48.858
Careful going
down these stairs.

22:48.900 --> 22:50.720
They're steep.

23:01.180 --> 23:03.444
Welcome to The Keep.

23:05.110 --> 23:07.578
(door closes)

23:07.620 --> 23:08.973
(brief beeping)

23:11.850 --> 23:13.511
Between those...

23:13.560 --> 23:15.152
and the storage in back,

23:15.190 --> 23:17.420
we've got enough
to feed 80 mouths

23:17.460 --> 23:19.451
for four years.

23:24.730 --> 23:26.698
Obviously, these
are all dehydrated foods.

23:26.730 --> 23:28.129
One of our
founding members

23:28.170 --> 23:30.161
is the chef--
if you don't like his recipes,

23:30.200 --> 23:31.838
you can tell him at dinner.

23:35.480 --> 23:36.708
Down there is the utility wing.

23:36.740 --> 23:38.640
Long-term
storage.

23:38.680 --> 23:39.977
Diesel generator.

23:40.010 --> 23:43.013
When the grid goes down,
our lights stay on.

23:43.050 --> 23:45.143
Ultra-low particulate
air filtration.

23:45.190 --> 23:48.011
The Andromeda Strain could
kill everyone up there.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.652
We'd be fine.

23:49.690 --> 23:51.988
The infirmary
is also down there.

23:52.030 --> 23:53.850
Fully equipped for
emergency surgery.

23:53.900 --> 23:56.949
Antibiotics, antivirals,
iodine pills...

23:57.000 --> 23:58.888
plus about a thousand Band-Aids.

23:58.930 --> 24:01.034
We've also got a top surgeon
in the group.

24:01.070 --> 24:03.937
Actually, I'm a surgeon.
Maybe I know them.

24:03.970 --> 24:05.699
Nice try.

24:05.740 --> 24:06.900
Come on.

24:06.940 --> 24:09.135
I'll show you the
sleeping quarters.

24:13.920 --> 24:15.945
This is A-Wing.

24:15.980 --> 24:18.983
Three more wings
just like it.

24:19.020 --> 24:20.954
Five bedrooms in each.

24:20.990 --> 24:23.686
The game room is here.

24:26.960 --> 24:28.928
RONNIE:
The gym is in B,

24:28.960 --> 24:32.020
Wine cellar, C,
the gun vault is in D.

24:32.070 --> 24:33.992
But everyone has access
to everything.

24:34.040 --> 24:37.760
Of course. Wouldn't want to
separate the Wine from the guns.

24:37.810 --> 24:39.937
(hinges creaking)

24:39.970 --> 24:41.676
This is the standard layout.

24:41.710 --> 24:43.905
But... you're welcome
to bring in your own stuff,

24:43.950 --> 24:45.645
arrange it however you like.

24:45.680 --> 24:47.819
The bedrooms are
your own private space.

24:47.850 --> 24:50.512
HOLMES: Which is more
than can be said for the cell

24:50.550 --> 24:51.517
you're gonna find
yourself in.

24:51.550 --> 24:52.949
But on the
bright side,

24:52.990 --> 24:55.857
you'll be safer in prison
during a disaster than in here.

24:55.890 --> 24:56.959
Excuse me?

24:56.990 --> 24:58.787
You're a fraud,
and this facility

24:58.830 --> 25:00.923
is a facade.

25:00.960 --> 25:04.088
Your ultra-low particulate
filtration system...

25:04.130 --> 25:05.597
is nonexistent.

25:05.630 --> 25:08.861
The concrete walls behind
the panels are cracked
from decades of neglect.

25:08.900 --> 25:10.606
I smelled the mold
from water seepage

25:10.640 --> 25:12.608
the moment we arrived.

25:14.640 --> 25:15.777
*

25:15.810 --> 25:17.675
Granted,
you've spared no expense

25:17.710 --> 25:19.575
where it would impress
your marks--

25:19.610 --> 25:21.168
the fancy furniture,
the...

25:22.620 --> 25:25.589
...high-definition
televisions--

25:25.620 --> 25:28.316
but anything
not immediately visible

25:28.360 --> 25:30.214
is either missing...

25:31.660 --> 25:32.979
...or woefully
inadequate.

25:33.030 --> 25:35.328
So this facility's incapable
of protecting anyone

25:35.360 --> 25:38.090
from anything.

25:38.130 --> 25:39.620
*

25:39.670 --> 25:42.298
Bet you don't even have
a generator.

25:54.080 --> 25:55.945
What is it?

25:57.820 --> 25:59.788
That lock plate's new.
Paint's been retouched.

25:59.820 --> 26:01.754
Someone forced that door open,

26:01.790 --> 26:03.826
and the concrete here
is chipped.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.122
It's been scrubbed.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.821
What would you say that is?

26:08.900 --> 26:10.697
It looks like blood.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.197
You gave me your phone.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.731
Got a good signal-- you should
put that on your Web site.

26:18.240 --> 26:20.299
Captain.

26:20.340 --> 26:23.002
I just sent you our location.
Watson and I believe

26:23.040 --> 26:25.179
we've found the site
of Dr. Bader's murder,

26:25.210 --> 26:27.747
and the reason
he was killed.

26:33.790 --> 26:35.917
_ BELL: _
Ba5ically, we're looking
at two scenarios.

26:35.960 --> 26:38.087
Both start with you
conning dozens of victims

26:38.130 --> 26:39.757
out of millions
of dollars.

26:39.790 --> 26:41.223
And the version you
want us to believe...

26:41.260 --> 26:43.125
It isn't a version.
I didn't do this.

26:43.160 --> 26:44.388
You discovered
Vincent Bader

26:44.430 --> 26:46.159
inside your bunker
already dead.

26:46.200 --> 26:49.067
Couldn't call the cops
without risking your scam,

26:49.100 --> 26:50.362
so you moved the
body instead.

26:50.400 --> 26:51.936
I know I did the wrong thing,

26:51.970 --> 26:53.130
but that's what happened.

26:53.170 --> 26:55.035
The other version is
you were With Bader

26:55.080 --> 26:57.674
when he saw behind the curtain,
and for the exact same reason,

26:57.710 --> 27:00.076
(phone buzzing)
you killed him.

27:00.110 --> 27:03.113
GREGSON:
Let me tell you why
we like that version better.

27:03.150 --> 27:05.687
You told our colleagues
it takes two keys

27:05.720 --> 27:07.119
to get inside the bunker.

27:07.150 --> 27:09.254
So, explain how Bader

27:09.290 --> 27:11.850
got in there
without you knowing about it.

27:11.890 --> 27:14.791
Someone broke into my office
Thursday night.

27:14.830 --> 27:17.025
The only thing missing
was a set of keys.

27:17.060 --> 27:19.790
That's why I went to check
on The Keep in the first place,

27:19.830 --> 27:21.798
and that's when
I found Dr. Bader.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.967
I don't suppose
you reported this break-in.

27:24.010 --> 27:25.238
HOLMES: Well, he
couldn't, could he?

27:25.270 --> 27:27.204
Assuming the break-in
even happened.

27:27.240 --> 27:29.276
Your house _of cards is built
on the illu5ion of security.

27:29.310 --> 27:32.074
What'll your customers think
if you can't safeguard
your own office?

27:33.980 --> 27:35.948
He was killed with a hatchet.

27:35.980 --> 27:38.016
Right?
The person who did it

27:38.050 --> 27:40.041
would have had to swing
the hatchet

27:40.090 --> 27:41.182
over his head.

27:41.220 --> 27:42.858
You said

27:42.890 --> 27:44.118
you're a doctor--
do you know about

27:44.160 --> 27:45.718
impingement syndrome?

27:45.760 --> 27:48.251
Inflammation of the tendons
in the rotator cuff

27:48.300 --> 27:50.325
caused by repeated
stress. Why?

27:50.360 --> 27:54.069
I messed up my shoulders
swimming in high school.

27:54.100 --> 27:56.739
I couldn't have swung a hatchet
ifI wanted to.

27:59.510 --> 28:01.899
I was never in...

28:01.940 --> 28:04.272
the Marines, okay?

28:04.310 --> 28:07.279
They turned me down
because of my shoulders

28:07.310 --> 28:09.039
when I tried to sign up.

28:09.080 --> 28:12.311
You got to be able
to check that. Right?

28:16.120 --> 28:17.212
(sighs)

28:18.990 --> 28:21.129
All right, so let's say
he's telling the truth.

28:21.160 --> 28:23.424
Bader and someone else drive
out to the bunker together,

28:23.460 --> 28:25.360
they discover the
whole thing is fake,

28:25.400 --> 28:27.391
so the other guy
flies off the handle.

28:27.430 --> 28:30.194
Maybe it was someone Bader
convinced to buy into The Keep,

28:30.240 --> 28:32.458
so he blamed Bader for
him losing his money.

28:32.510 --> 28:34.137
Maybe, but we still
don't know what they

28:34.180 --> 28:35.909
were doing out there
in the first place.

28:35.940 --> 28:37.908
Check Wright's Marine story.

28:37.950 --> 28:40.145
Make sure this
shoulder thing is real.

28:40.180 --> 28:42.774
If it is, we got to
start combing through
his other clients.

28:42.820 --> 28:46.312
At the minimum, he's looking at
fraud and hindering prosecution.

28:46.350 --> 28:49.285
I'm pretty sure he'll give up
that list of names now.

28:49.320 --> 28:51.424
HOLMES:
Apologies I don't have

28:51.460 --> 28:54.190
any wine to offer you.
Today's a weekday.

28:54.230 --> 28:56.949
Tomorrow's also a weekday.

28:57.000 --> 28:59.195
I don't drink wine on weekdays.

28:59.230 --> 29:02.290
It affects my sleep.
I've tested it.

29:02.340 --> 29:04.103
Ah. Much as I would have.

29:04.140 --> 29:06.199
The water is fine.

29:13.510 --> 29:16.274
Thank you. (pants)

29:16.320 --> 29:20.188
Uh, Watson said you stopped by.
1-1 texted you...

29:20.220 --> 29:22.256
I have something
to say.

29:23.520 --> 29:26.057
I memorized it ahead of time...

29:26.090 --> 29:28.297
because it's hard.

29:28.330 --> 29:30.389
Well, I shall endeavor
not to interrupt.

29:31.970 --> 29:34.336
You're very considerate of me.

29:34.370 --> 29:37.294
I've noticed that.
Very careful.

29:37.340 --> 29:40.229
It's one of the things
I liked most about you

29:40.270 --> 29:42.579
at first.

29:42.610 --> 29:45.408
When we first started dating,
it felt like you liked me

29:45.450 --> 29:48.374
because I was a woman
that you liked.

29:48.420 --> 29:51.810
It didn't matter that
I was neuroatypical.

29:51.850 --> 29:53.317
That is...

29:53.350 --> 29:55.818
it mattered, obviously.

29:55.860 --> 29:59.887
But.. it also...
didn't matter to you.

29:59.930 --> 30:03.229
And now it feels like you're
not being yourself with me.

30:03.260 --> 30:05.069
You're being careful.
You're doing

30:05.100 --> 30:07.159
what you think you're
supposed to do,

30:07.200 --> 30:09.134
because I'm different.

30:09.170 --> 30:13.004
And... that makes me feel
like a project

30:13.040 --> 30:16.077
or a problem for you to solve.

30:16.110 --> 30:17.270
And...

30:17.310 --> 30:19.904
that isn't the way
I want to feel.

30:19.950 --> 30:21.918
So...

30:21.950 --> 30:23.918
Iam...

30:23.950 --> 30:26.180
breaking up with you.

30:28.360 --> 30:30.988
Thank you for the water.

30:35.360 --> 30:38.568
Marcus and I were going through
the names of Keep members,

30:38.600 --> 30:41.296
when this one caught our eye.
Clyde Staller.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.036
BELL:
There's not much about him
online except that he made

30:44.070 --> 30:46.334
a truckload of money
about three years ago

30:46.370 --> 30:47.564
selling a sobeare startup

30:47.610 --> 30:50.101
and that he really hates
paying taxes.

30:50.140 --> 30:52.404
Sounds just like anyone else
who'd be on this list.

30:52.450 --> 30:55.044
What made him jump out?
I recognized

30:55.080 --> 30:56.638
the name of his company,
Ardent Army.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.216
Earlier today, Sherlock and I

30:58.250 --> 31:00.047
were looking
at discussion boards

31:00.090 --> 31:01.182
that Bader chatted on.

31:01.220 --> 31:02.881
One of the preppers
he talked to

31:02.920 --> 31:04.387
had the username ArdentArmy.
Bader recommended

31:04.430 --> 31:06.386
The Keep to Staller
on that board.

31:06.430 --> 31:09.092
And from the looks of the date
in Wright's file,

31:09.130 --> 31:11.519
Staller bought in based on that.
So, if anyone

31:11.570 --> 31:14.061
would be mad at Bader
over the bunkers being fake,

31:14.100 --> 31:16.295
you figure
it's got to be this guy.

31:16.340 --> 31:17.932
BELL:
Staller loved
to rant about

31:17.970 --> 31:19.369
how much he mistrusts
the government.

31:19.410 --> 31:22.004
Maybe we can lure him
to do it in person.

31:29.020 --> 31:31.409
Staller's inside.
Got here just after I did.

31:31.450 --> 31:34.214
His skinny jeans make the
odds of a concealed firearm

31:34.260 --> 31:35.955
quite slim.
That's good to know.

31:35.990 --> 31:37.287
How'd it go
with Fiona?

31:37.320 --> 31:39.322
We'll discuss it later.

31:41.560 --> 31:43.152
Whoa, you guys have
the wrong idea.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.088
I don't know anything
about a murder.

31:45.130 --> 31:48.429
You'd be surprised how
many confessions start that way.

31:48.470 --> 31:51.507
All right, you think I was mad
because The Keep was a fraud.

31:51.540 --> 31:54.532
I knew The Keep was a fraud.

31:54.580 --> 31:57.140
It's why I was interested
in it in the first place.

31:57.180 --> 31:58.374
Do explain.

31:58.410 --> 32:00.139
I'd like to get my wallet out,

32:00.180 --> 32:02.239
show you my driver's license.
Is that okay?

32:02.280 --> 32:03.542
Why don't I get it for you.

32:03.580 --> 32:05.116
Yeah.

32:09.220 --> 32:10.983
My real name is Jeff Danks.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.622
I'm an editor
for Bunksaw.com.

32:12.660 --> 32:15.390
_You're_
a journalist.
Yes. I'm...

32:15.430 --> 32:19.059
writing an expos
on The Keep.

32:21.140 --> 32:23.495
"'Ayn Rand Shrugged'

32:23.540 --> 32:25.531
"by Jeff Danks.
Of course a doomsday bunker

32:25.570 --> 32:26.559
"for the rich is a scam.

32:26.610 --> 32:27.668
"Aren't these the guys
who insist,

32:27.710 --> 32:29.405
'Every man for himself'?"

32:29.440 --> 32:31.408
Clyde Staller,
tech entrepreneur,

32:31.450 --> 32:33.668
is a persona
you created online.

32:33.710 --> 32:35.678
Newly-minted millionaire,
no formal education.

32:35.720 --> 32:38.518
The lack of history is a
virtue rather than a red flag.

32:38.550 --> 32:40.518
Spout a few
of the right political views,

32:40.550 --> 32:42.381
you can infiltrate
the prepper boards.

32:42.420 --> 32:44.422
So how did you know?

32:45.760 --> 32:47.557
I started out doing a piece
on preppers.

32:47.590 --> 32:50.229
Heard about The Keep
and started digging.

32:50.260 --> 32:53.525
So many people fall
for cons like this

32:53.570 --> 32:55.367
because the top secret thing
convinces them

32:55.400 --> 32:57.664
not to look closely.
They're not supposed to know

32:57.700 --> 32:59.509
who Wright's
military advisor is,

32:59.540 --> 33:01.679
so they accept that they can't.

33:01.710 --> 33:04.144
But it leaves a paper trail
when you try to buy

33:04.180 --> 33:06.205
30,000 gallons of diesel.

33:06.250 --> 33:08.673
It wasn't hard to confirm
that they never did.

33:08.720 --> 33:11.188
Same goes for his stockpile
of food, the antibiotics,

33:11.220 --> 33:12.744
his generator.

33:12.790 --> 33:14.553
Thank you very
much, Mr. Danks.

33:14.590 --> 33:16.683
You've been very
helpful. We need to go

33:16.720 --> 33:18.449
to Vincent Bader's house.
Specifically,

33:18.490 --> 33:20.026
his garage.

33:20.060 --> 33:22.494
(whirring)

33:29.540 --> 33:32.509
BELL:
Imagine how much help
we could be

33:32.540 --> 33:34.201
if you told us
what we're looking for.

33:34.240 --> 33:36.037
Well, I'm not looking
for anything.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.674
I'm hoping to confirm
an item's absence.

33:38.710 --> 33:41.076
Okay, so what
are we not looking for?

33:41.120 --> 33:44.248
As Mr. Danks ticked off
the bunker's non-inventory,

33:44.290 --> 33:46.508
a new theory started to develop.

33:46.550 --> 33:48.711
This is a bug-out bag.

33:48.760 --> 33:52.321
It's the absolute essentials
that a doomsday prepper

33:52.360 --> 33:53.725
would grab
when Armageddon

33:53.760 --> 33:56.354
finally dawns.
This particular bag

33:56.400 --> 33:58.527
is sold as a kit.

34:00.500 --> 34:03.389
Included in that kit...

34:03.440 --> 34:07.399
Is a multipurpose tool,
like the one the killer used.

34:07.440 --> 34:10.079
Said tool is not in this bag.

34:10.110 --> 34:12.078
We've been thinking
the tool belonged

34:12.110 --> 34:14.146
to a different prepper.
Bader's killer.

34:14.180 --> 34:16.478
Or, prior to the discovery
that the bunker was bare,

34:16.520 --> 34:19.409
that it was a weapon of
opportunity found at the scene.

34:19.450 --> 34:20.781
But Bader brought the tool
himself.

34:20.820 --> 34:22.788
It must've been
in his gym bag.

34:22.820 --> 34:25.186
But why? We still don't know
what he was doing there.

34:25.230 --> 34:28.449
That's where the new theory,
courtesy of Mr. Danks, comes in.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.650
I know why Bader went
to the bunker that night.

34:30.700 --> 34:32.190
And with whom.

34:37.540 --> 34:39.167
Appreciate you coming down,
Dr. Wallace.

34:39.210 --> 34:40.768
Hope you didn't have to juggle
too many patients.

34:40.810 --> 34:43.335
Not a problem. Anything
I can do to help.

34:43.380 --> 34:46.201
Great. You know Ms. Watson.
This is Detective Bell

34:46.250 --> 34:48.775
and Sherlock Holmes.
Have a seat.

34:48.820 --> 34:50.776
(grunts)

34:50.820 --> 34:55.359
Some information's come to light
about Dr. Bader's murder.

34:55.390 --> 34:57.688
It could have an impact
on your practice,

34:57.720 --> 35:00.188
so... we thought
you ought to know.

35:00.230 --> 35:03.154
His wife told me
that he was killed in a...

35:03.200 --> 35:04.861
doomsday bunker.

35:04.900 --> 35:06.697
That another prepper killed him.

35:06.730 --> 35:07.890
HOLMES:
We believe that
that's what the killer

35:07.930 --> 35:10.160
intended us to think.
Your partner

35:10.200 --> 35:12.737
had gotten himself involved
with a group of pill traffickers

35:12.770 --> 35:15.136
called the Silver Rail.
We have reason to think

35:15.180 --> 35:17.808
he tried to break things off
with them but couldn't.

35:17.840 --> 35:21.241
You think Vince was killed
by drug dealers?
We would

35:21.280 --> 35:24.317
have thought that, except
they didn't know he was dead.
There was

35:24.350 --> 35:26.784
someone else who had reason to
kill him over his bad deCI5ions.

35:26.820 --> 35:29.254
You. Because of the mess
he'd gotten into

35:29.290 --> 35:30.882
could have brought
your whole practice down.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.888
HOLMES:
We'd been asking ourselves
for some time

35:32.930 --> 35:35.296
what Dr. Bader was doing
in the bunker that night.

35:35.330 --> 35:36.888
He had a need.

35:36.930 --> 35:39.160
He had a drug gang
breathing down his neck.

35:39.200 --> 35:41.168
He had weathered _
one government inspection,

35:41.200 --> 35:43.339
but his luck couldn't hold out.
He needed pain pills,

35:43.370 --> 35:45.167
and he needed lots of them.

35:45.210 --> 35:48.805
The infirmary at The Keep should
have had them by the thousands.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.432
Now, Dr. Bader called you
the day he was killed.

35:50.480 --> 35:52.345
You said so yourself.
Maybe it was the first time

35:52.380 --> 35:54.746
he told you about the mess
he was in. Maybe it wasn't.

35:54.780 --> 35:57.169
Either way, you went down to
the bunker with him that night

35:57.220 --> 35:59.142
to help him steal the pills.

36:00.990 --> 36:03.413
Now, the problem was
the pills didn't exist.

36:03.460 --> 36:06.725
So you did some quick math.

36:06.760 --> 36:07.954
If Bader kept giving
Silver Rail pills,

36:07.990 --> 36:10.197
he was gonna destroy
your practice.

36:10.230 --> 36:11.959
If he stopped
and Silver Rail killed him,

36:12.000 --> 36:14.560
the investigation
into his murder by a drug gang

36:14.600 --> 36:16.238
was going to destroy
your practice.

36:16.270 --> 36:18.261
Either way, he was gonna ruin
your life's work.

36:18.310 --> 36:20.198
HOLMES:
It wasn't fair.

36:20.240 --> 36:22.231
But if he died down there,

36:22.280 --> 36:24.908
the odds would fall
much more in your favor.

36:24.950 --> 36:26.542
You didn't know Ronnie Wright.

36:26.580 --> 36:28.912
You assumed he would not
notify the police

36:28.950 --> 36:31.248
that a murder had happened
inside The Keep

36:31.290 --> 36:34.350
and put his con at risk.
If there was no body found,

36:34.390 --> 36:36.358
that was great.
If the body was found,

36:36.390 --> 36:38.529
it pointed towards Ronnie,
that was still great.

36:38.560 --> 36:41.552
Either way,
your practice remains unscathed.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.398
I don't know where
you're getting any of this.

36:44.430 --> 36:45.966
I told you,

36:46.000 --> 36:48.230
I was with my girlfriend
and her family all weekend

36:48.270 --> 36:49.567
on Lake Ronkonkoma.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.329
We checked,
and that's true.

36:52.810 --> 36:55.335
But there was about
a two-and-a-half-hour window

36:55.380 --> 36:57.234
that night when your girlfriend
and her family

36:57.280 --> 36:58.804
went to a movie without you.

36:58.850 --> 37:00.647
You told them you
weren't feeling well.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.717
That's not enough time to go
to the city and back, but...

37:03.750 --> 37:05.388
the bunker is in Manorville,

37:05.420 --> 37:07.388
which is much closer
to Ronkonkoma.

37:07.420 --> 37:09.980
So if Bader came to you,
you would've had

37:10.020 --> 37:11.681
plenty of time to help him
break into the bunker

37:11.730 --> 37:13.322
to steal the drugs.

37:13.360 --> 37:15.453
GREGSON: That's a photo
of you picking up Bader

37:15.500 --> 37:17.957
at the Ronkonkoma train station.

37:18.000 --> 37:22.790
As far as we know, it's the last
image of Vincent Bader alive.

37:22.840 --> 37:24.398
Now, please,

37:24.440 --> 37:27.603
you want to tell me again
how wrong we are?

37:29.910 --> 37:32.344
Please, come in.

37:42.690 --> 37:44.351
Thank you
for coming.

37:44.390 --> 37:46.483
I know it's contrary
to your wishes.

37:46.530 --> 37:50.057
I broke up with you, so we're
not seeing each other anymore.

37:50.100 --> 37:54.059
But that use of the word
"seeing" is figurative.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.796
We can still see each other.

37:58.810 --> 38:02.075
I-I know that you appreciate
honesty and directness,

38:02.110 --> 38:04.578
so, um,
I'll-I'll be direct with you.

38:04.610 --> 38:06.601
I think you've misjudged me.

38:07.850 --> 38:09.818
I say that without reproach.

38:09.850 --> 38:11.647
I just think you should know.

38:13.020 --> 38:14.351
You said you'd had

38:14.390 --> 38:16.779
two serious relationships
in the past.

38:16.820 --> 38:19.687
It might surprise you to learn
that puts you at least one,

38:19.730 --> 38:21.595
and arguably two, ahead of me.

38:21.630 --> 38:24.793
I had
one great romance

38:24.830 --> 38:26.798
in my life.

38:26.830 --> 38:29.697
One would be hard-pressed
to call her a girlfriend.

38:29.740 --> 38:32.800
And even harder pressed to call
that relationship a success.

38:32.840 --> 38:34.831
I never felt

38:34.880 --> 38:36.609
the need beyond that.

38:36.640 --> 38:38.608
Part of the reason for that

38:38.650 --> 38:41.847
is that relationships
are hard for me.

38:41.880 --> 38:44.383
You sensed
that I was making

38:44.420 --> 38:46.809
an extra effort
to make things work with you.

38:46.850 --> 38:49.410
In that, you were correct.

38:49.460 --> 38:52.827
But you presumed that that was
because you're different.

38:52.860 --> 38:54.828
It is not.

38:54.860 --> 38:57.420
It is because I'm different.

38:58.130 --> 39:00.098
And because

39:00.130 --> 39:02.098
you are the rare woman
I have come across

39:02.140 --> 39:06.600
for whom I believe
that extra effort is worthwhile.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.972
So whatever
the future holds,

39:09.010 --> 39:12.400
whether we see each other again
or not,

39:12.450 --> 39:15.339
I wanted you to know.

39:18.150 --> 39:20.118
Is Joan home?

39:20.150 --> 39:21.754
No.

39:21.790 --> 39:23.781
I requested
she give us some privacy.

39:23.820 --> 39:25.924
Okay.
I think we should have sex now.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.921
Do you want to have sex now?

39:31.030 --> 39:33.999
I-I don't not want to have...
