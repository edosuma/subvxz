17:50.570 --> 17:53.447
And now, let the circus begin!

17:53.489 --> 17:57.869
And now, Greasy walks

17:53.489 --> 17:57.869
the tightrope without a net.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.746
Hold on to your hat.

17:59.787 --> 18:03.374
♪ Da da na na na ♪

18:03.416 --> 18:07.378

18:08.671 --> 18:11.049
- 'Yay.'

18:08.671 --> 18:11.049
- Bada bing.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.717
Now what?

18:12.759 --> 18:15.887
Now, it's time for

18:12.759 --> 18:15.887
Michelle's Big Top to present

18:15.929 --> 18:18.389
Greasy and

18:15.929 --> 18:18.389
Stephabell's fun-filled

18:18.431 --> 18:20.850
extravaganza of puppet love.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.730
(Jesse)

18:22.476 --> 18:25.730
Hi, Sock-O, how are you

18:22.476 --> 18:25.730
on this beautiful day?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.523
(Stephanie)

18:25.772 --> 18:27.523
Not so good, Toesy.

18:27.565 --> 18:30.150
I'm locked in a gas station.

18:30.192 --> 18:32.319
Thanks to my uncle.

18:35.114 --> 18:37.867
(Jesse)

18:35.114 --> 18:37.867
I hardly think placing

18:35.114 --> 18:37.867
the blame on the nice uncle

18:37.909 --> 18:39.702
is gonna help the situation.

18:39.744 --> 18:42.663
(Stephanie)

18:39.744 --> 18:42.663
Well, you did ask

18:39.744 --> 18:42.663
how my day was.

18:42.705 --> 18:45.124
(Jesse)

18:42.705 --> 18:45.124
Yeah, yes, I realize that.

18:42.705 --> 18:45.124
But it's not the uncle's fault.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.166
- It is.

18:45.165 --> 18:46.166
- It isn't.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.753
- It is.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.753
- It isn't.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.005
Help! I'm naked, I'm naked!

18:51.047 --> 18:53.591
That's funny.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.843
And now, Greasy and Stephanie

18:55.885 --> 18:58.137
proudly present the big finale.

18:58.178 --> 19:01.766

19:09.023 --> 19:12.401

19:12.443 --> 19:15.947
Steph, come on. It's for

19:12.443 --> 19:15.947
Michelle. Try it for Michelle.

19:15.989 --> 19:17.573
- Okay.

Whoa, you did it,

19:21.410 --> 19:24.371
Steph. Alright!

19:24.413 --> 19:27.207

19:27.249 --> 19:29.502
How do you do that?

19:29.543 --> 19:31.504
I have no idea.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.489
bathroom before you lock up?

19:58.531 --> 20:00.992
- What's the matter with you?

19:58.531 --> 20:00.992
- What's the matter with me?

20:01.034 --> 20:03.494
You're the one that's wearing

20:01.034 --> 20:03.494
a funnel on his head.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.123
Ow!

20:12.045 --> 20:13.171
Hi.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.964
Oh, come here, Michelle.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.423
Hi, honey.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.884
Hi, Steph.

20:17.925 --> 20:21.971
Jess, I have one word

20:17.925 --> 20:21.971
for you, how?

20:22.013 --> 20:23.514
Danny, I told you on the phone

20:22.013 --> 20:23.514
it wasn't my fault.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.224
Oh, sure you read

20:23.556 --> 20:25.224
about it every day

20:25.265 --> 20:29.269
"Family trapped in gas station.

20:25.265 --> 20:29.269
Child's birthday ruined."

20:29.311 --> 20:30.855
'Well, look,

20:29.311 --> 20:30.855
I-I'm sorry, but what--'

20:30.897 --> 20:32.648
How could you let this happen?

20:32.690 --> 20:35.234
We just put on a three-hour

20:32.690 --> 20:35.234
circus for the neighbors' kids.

20:36.569 --> 20:39.072
Michelle, honey, I know

20:36.569 --> 20:39.072
you were looking forward

20:39.113 --> 20:41.281
to a big party

20:39.113 --> 20:41.281
with all your friends.

20:41.323 --> 20:45.494
- But we can still have fun.

20:41.323 --> 20:45.494
- Daddy, I saw clowns.

20:45.536 --> 20:47.413
Yes, honey,

20:45.536 --> 20:47.413
I know you saw clowns.

20:47.454 --> 20:49.289
Daddy's dressed up like a clown.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.542
Uncle Jesse was a clown.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.837
Uncle Jesse was a clown?

20:54.879 --> 20:56.255
Uncle Jesse hates clowns.

20:56.296 --> 20:57.548
More than ever.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.676
But he was a great clown.

21:00.718 --> 21:03.179
He made a whole circus

21:00.718 --> 21:03.179
at the gas station.

21:03.221 --> 21:05.389
With a tightrope walker,

21:03.221 --> 21:05.389
and a puppet show

21:05.431 --> 21:08.601
and two jugglers,

21:05.431 --> 21:08.601
thank you very much.

21:09.894 --> 21:12.646
Jess, you really put on

21:09.894 --> 21:12.646
a circus for Michelle?

21:12.688 --> 21:14.815
Hey, it was my niece's

21:12.688 --> 21:14.815
third birthday.

21:14.857 --> 21:17.818
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

21:18.652 --> 21:19.987
Shame on me.

21:20.029 --> 21:22.115
There's nothing lower

21:20.029 --> 21:22.115
than a cranky clown.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.492
You were a great uncle today.

21:25.534 --> 21:27.828
Heck, you're

21:25.534 --> 21:27.828
a great uncle everyday.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.122
Thanks, buddy.

21:29.163 --> 21:32.125
Ho-ho, ho-ho, ho-ho.

21:29.163 --> 21:32.125
This is a bozo no-no.

21:35.211 --> 21:36.712
Oh, Michelle, you're back.

21:36.754 --> 21:38.881
We saved you a special surprise

21:36.754 --> 21:38.881
from your party.

21:38.923 --> 21:40.841
Come on, it's in the back yard.

21:40.883 --> 21:43.510
- Come on, let's go see it.

21:40.883 --> 21:43.510
- Special surprise?

21:43.552 --> 21:45.012
What do you think it is?

21:45.054 --> 21:47.807
Uncle Jesse, how'd you get

21:45.054 --> 21:47.807
locked in a gas station?

21:47.848 --> 21:49.850
D.J., someday

21:47.848 --> 21:49.850
when you're older

21:49.892 --> 21:52.770
and you get locked in a gas

21:49.892 --> 21:52.770
station, you'll understand.

21:56.190 --> 21:59.277
- Oh!

21:56.190 --> 21:59.277
- Wow!

21:59.318 --> 22:01.737
Happy birthday, Michelle.

22:01.779 --> 22:05.074
- Bimbo.

22:01.779 --> 22:05.074
- No, Michelle, that's Dumbo.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.202
Big present.

22:08.244 --> 22:11.080
Well, it's not to keep, honey.

22:08.244 --> 22:11.080
It's just to ride.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.748
And here we go.

22:12.790 --> 22:14.959
