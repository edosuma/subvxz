<i>[narrator] Alaska, a vast, remote
wilderness twice the size of Texas.</i>

00:06.040 --> 00:09.808
You could walk for a year
without seeing another person.

00:09.810 --> 00:12.911
<i>[narrator] In one of the most
mysterious corners of the globe.</i>

00:12.913 --> 00:14.747
Everything in your being
is telling you

00:14.749 --> 00:16.548
to get the hell out of there.

00:16.550 --> 00:19.218
<i>[narrator] This is a place
hundreds of times more deathly</i>

00:19.220 --> 00:20.719
<i>than the Bermuda triangle.</i>

00:20.721 --> 00:23.222
Whoa! My God!

00:23.224 --> 00:25.424
<i>[narrator] Stories
of alien abductions.</i>

00:25.426 --> 00:28.027
That was definitely something
not from this world.

00:28.029 --> 00:31.830
<i>[narrator] The paranormal, vanishing
airplanes and strange beasts...</i>

00:31.832 --> 00:35.000
Bigfoot could be anywhere

[narrator] <i>Have haunted those
who've dared set foot here.</i>

00:37.804 --> 00:38.871
What's that?

00:38.873 --> 00:41.240
Now I feel like
something's after me.

00:43.576 --> 00:45.044
[narrator]
<i>In the last 30 years</i>

00:45.046 --> 00:49.148
<i>16,000 people have
disappeared without a trace.</i>

00:49.150 --> 00:53.552
In the vastness of this country,
it's easy to be swallowed up in it.

00:53.554 --> 00:56.155
<i>[narrator] Witnesses tell us
their shocking stories.</i>

00:56.157 --> 00:57.890
I was horrified.

00:57.957 --> 01:01.193
<i>[narrator] And we've gathered some of
the world's leading experts in their field.</i>

01:01.195 --> 01:04.696
<i>[man] I wanted to go out and
get the evidence myself and say,</i>

01:04.698 --> 01:07.032
"This is real.
These stuff exists."

01:07.034 --> 01:12.204
<i>[narrator] To try and unlock the
mystery of the Alaska triangle.</i>

01:21.915 --> 01:25.984
[narrator] <i>Skagway, one of the
most haunted towns in Alaska.</i>

01:25.986 --> 01:32.658
<i>Where dreams were broken, and men died
on the trail of the 19th century gold rush.</i>

01:32.660 --> 01:36.995
People bet their entire lives
on the possibility

01:36.997 --> 01:40.032
of finding these tiny little
nuggets of gold.

01:40.034 --> 01:44.103
<i>Untold riches and sometimes
those hopes were dashed.</i>

01:46.406 --> 01:51.577
[narrator] <i>From haunted
hotels to murderous brothels.</i>

01:51.579 --> 01:54.980
<i>The ghosts from the past
continue to taunt its people.</i>

01:55.381 --> 01:57.349
[woman]
<i>He saw the stabbing.</i>

01:57.917 --> 01:59.651
It was pretty terrifying.

01:59.653 --> 02:01.086
[narrator]
<i>The paranormal here</i>

02:01.088 --> 02:03.956
<i>can scare even the hardiest
of ghost hunters.</i>

02:05.258 --> 02:07.960
[Mike] Whoa,
what is it picking up now?

02:08.995 --> 02:10.229
What's your name?

02:10.231 --> 02:11.530
[indistinct whisper]

02:11.532 --> 02:14.099
Whoa! My God!

02:20.840 --> 02:25.344
<i>[narrator] 1897, the beginning
the Klondike gold rush.</i>

02:27.046 --> 02:31.283
<i>When stories of striking it rich hit
newspaper stands across the US,</i>

02:31.285 --> 02:35.554
<i>over 100 thousand men would
set sail to the poor town of Skagway</i>

02:35.556 --> 02:38.157
<i>in the southeastern corner
of the Alaska triangle</i>

02:38.159 --> 02:40.492
<i>in the hope
of making their fortune.</i>

02:42.862 --> 02:46.365
<i>Historian Steve Levi has
written about their journey.</i>

02:48.835 --> 02:51.103
<i>[Steve] It's a wild time.</i>

02:51.105 --> 02:56.108
Doctors, lawyers, piano players,
crooks, convicts, prostitutes,

02:56.110 --> 02:58.577
everybody was
coming through Skagway.

03:00.213 --> 03:02.047
<i>[narrator] The so called
"Stampeders" sent off</i>

03:02.049 --> 03:06.118
<i>on a treacherous 500 mile
track from the port of Skagway</i>

03:06.120 --> 03:08.954
<i>up the infamous golden staircase</i>

03:08.956 --> 03:11.023
<i>over Alaska's coast mountains</i>

03:11.025 --> 03:14.259
<i>to Canada's prized
gold fields in Dawson.</i>

03:17.630 --> 03:20.199
<i>Most, however,
went home penniless</i>

03:20.201 --> 03:22.935
<i>and many never even
made it out of Skagway.</i>

03:24.804 --> 03:26.405
[Steve]
<i>It's a very violent city.</i>

03:27.106 --> 03:30.042
The city that had a death a day.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.178
<i>A doctor couldn't make
a living in Skagway</i>

03:33.180 --> 03:35.280
<i>because people just got chopped.</i>

03:36.216 --> 03:39.151
<i>Then no one got sick,
everybody just got killed.</i>

03:39.852 --> 03:41.820
<i>[narrator] With
Skagway's dark history,</i>

03:41.822 --> 03:45.490
<i>it's no wonder it's such
a draw for lost spirits.</i>

03:47.093 --> 03:50.596
<i>Its cemeteries seem haunted
by victims of murder</i>

03:50.598 --> 03:52.497
<i>and gold mining tragedies.</i>

03:56.936 --> 03:59.972
<i>Hotels seemed possessed
by women whose husbands went</i>

03:59.974 --> 04:02.608
<i>to the gold fields
and never returned.</i>

04:05.578 --> 04:08.547
<i>Even ghost ships
like the Princess Sofia,</i>

04:08.549 --> 04:11.183
<i>left Skagway cursed
with tragedy...</i>

04:14.787 --> 04:18.490
<i>Taking more than 300 lives
to a watery grave.</i>

04:19.926 --> 04:23.028
<i>Their ghosts
are still seen to this day.</i>

04:26.899 --> 04:29.001
<i>Paranormal expert, Jeff Richards</i>

04:29.003 --> 04:31.603
<i>has been investigating
the hauntings here.</i>

04:32.772 --> 04:36.708
Those dire circumstances,
unfortunately, they leave a mark.

04:36.710 --> 04:39.978
They leave a mark,
loss of life, loss of hope...

04:40.780 --> 04:44.483
<i>The mysterious forces that
comprise the Alaska triangle</i>

04:44.485 --> 04:50.222
could be what keep the spirit here
in Skagway present and so active.

04:52.258 --> 04:56.561
<i>[narrator] No more so than in one
of the most haunted bars in Skagway.</i>

04:56.963 --> 04:59.197
<i>The Red Onion Saloon.</i>

05:00.867 --> 05:04.069
<i>But it sold more than liquor
during the gold rush.</i>

05:04.570 --> 05:07.172
<i>It also sold sex.</i>

05:07.174 --> 05:11.276
<i>According to operations
manager, Elizabeth Lavoie.</i>

05:11.278 --> 05:15.380
When a miner wanted to enjoy
the company of a woman,

05:15.382 --> 05:19.051
<i>he would be taken upstairs,
escorted by the bouncer,</i>

05:19.053 --> 05:21.987
<i>he would be shown into
the woman of his choice,</i>

05:22.021 --> 05:24.323
and then he would pay.

05:25.892 --> 05:30.395
Our brothel was one of the most
expensive with the highest class ladies.

05:33.766 --> 05:35.901
<i>[narrator] Cori Giacomazzi
helped turn</i>

05:35.903 --> 05:38.603
<i>the former brothel upstairs
into a museum</i>

05:38.605 --> 05:42.140
<i>and arrived here in 2004
to become its curator.</i>

05:44.177 --> 05:48.480
<i>But soon she realized this place
had a dark history of hauntings.</i>

05:51.851 --> 05:53.385
<i>She heard footsteps.</i>

05:56.723 --> 06:01.993
<i>And fellow workers told Cori about
other unexplained experiences.</i>

06:01.995 --> 06:04.029
[Cori] <i>Things will
start happening.</i>

06:04.031 --> 06:06.732
Like, they can't get
into the safe downstairs or

06:06.734 --> 06:09.568
they get shoved down the
stairs, or different things happen.

06:10.770 --> 06:13.638
<i>There've been times
I've walked into the brothel</i>

06:13.640 --> 06:18.343
and you just get this feeling
that you just shouldn't be in here.

06:22.715 --> 06:27.119
<i>[narrator] One of her colleagues
experienced something even more sinister.</i>

06:29.756 --> 06:31.089
[Cori]
<i>End of the month inventory.</i>

06:31.091 --> 06:34.025
<i>She's in the freezer
counting pizza doughs.</i>

06:43.803 --> 06:46.571
Next thing you know,
she ended up being pushed.

06:47.840 --> 06:52.277
She felt two hands
on her back and a push.

06:53.179 --> 06:54.913
[narrator]
<i>But when she tried to escape,</i>

06:54.915 --> 06:57.182
<i>things took a turn
for the worse.</i>

06:58.651 --> 07:00.519
<i>[Cori] She was struggling
to get out.</i>

07:02.121 --> 07:06.291
She was ready to yell at
somebody for harassing her this way.

07:09.295 --> 07:10.962
<i>And there was nobody there.</i>

07:10.997 --> 07:12.464
[gasps]

07:15.635 --> 07:18.270
<i>[narrator] Cori's coworker
soon told her more</i>

07:18.272 --> 07:22.007
<i>about the spirit responsible
for these ghostly goings on.</i>

07:22.575 --> 07:24.476
<i>They called her, "Lidia."</i>

07:32.018 --> 07:34.553
<i>They believe she was one
of the working girls</i>

07:34.555 --> 07:37.389
<i>who plied their trade
at the Red Onion Saloon.</i>

07:38.825 --> 07:40.926
<i>She was forced
into prostitution,</i>

07:40.928 --> 07:43.061
<i>like many women
during the gold rush</i>

07:43.063 --> 07:46.331
<i>who's husbands deserted them
for the gold fields.</i>

07:47.066 --> 07:48.834
<i>[Cori] Quite often
they didn't come back,</i>

07:48.836 --> 07:51.470
so the ladies would end up
staying here waiting

07:51.472 --> 07:55.106
and some of them turn to
the world's oldest profession

07:55.108 --> 07:58.510
<i>and Lidia, from what we could
gather, came to work here.</i>

08:02.815 --> 08:05.584
[narrator] <i>But the Alaska triangle
it seems, would soon reveal</i>

08:05.586 --> 08:08.520
<i>a more sinister twist
to its hauntings.</i>

08:10.957 --> 08:14.960
<i>The Red Onion's ghost would
reveal a more ominous history.</i>

08:15.862 --> 08:18.563
<i>One of suicide and murder.</i>

08:18.565 --> 08:20.999
[screaming]

08:32.545 --> 08:34.479
[narrator]
<i>The Red Onion Saloon,</i>

08:34.481 --> 08:39.017
<i>one of the most haunted places in
the gold rush ghost town of Skagway.</i>

08:40.753 --> 08:45.390
<i>In 1898 it was perhaps the
town's more prolific brothel.</i>

08:46.959 --> 08:50.195
<i>But a ghost of one
of its working women, Lidia,</i>

08:50.197 --> 08:52.497
<i>continues to taunt
the staff here.</i>

08:55.368 --> 08:58.870
<i>One day, a tour guide
put her call girl costume on,</i>

08:58.872 --> 09:00.539
<i>ready to start her shift,</i>

09:01.274 --> 09:05.143
<i>then came across
a sight she'd never forget.</i>

09:05.978 --> 09:09.047
She walked into
this room at one point.

09:09.049 --> 09:12.417
<i>She looked up into
this particular corner.</i>

09:17.957 --> 09:21.126
<i>She saw this woman
hanging from the ceiling,</i>

09:21.128 --> 09:25.564
<i>she got scared and that's
when she realized it was Lidia.</i>

09:27.233 --> 09:30.001
[screaming]

09:32.772 --> 09:36.441
<i>[narrator] There also seemed to
be something sinister on Lidia's face.</i>

09:39.211 --> 09:41.613
She was seen with a scar
on her right cheek.

09:49.655 --> 09:52.557
<i>[narrator] This scar had
a tragic significance.</i>

09:54.160 --> 09:57.095
The thought is back in those
days they would sometimes

09:57.097 --> 09:59.064
brand women
if they had syphilis,

09:59.066 --> 10:02.534
so that everyone would know.

10:02.536 --> 10:06.271
[Cori] <i>So we're assuming Lidia
may have taken her own life</i>

10:06.273 --> 10:08.873
because she didn't have
any other way to make a living,

10:08.875 --> 10:12.978
no way out, and she was sick.

10:12.980 --> 10:20.051
This is what this poor woman had to
do to survive and then in the end, didn't.

10:26.959 --> 10:30.962
<i>[narrator] But soon, Cori would
finally witness Lidia for herself.</i>

10:33.766 --> 10:35.867
<i>Late one Halloween evening,</i>

10:35.869 --> 10:39.270
<i>she was taking guests on
a tour of the brothel museum.</i>

10:41.273 --> 10:44.075
We were doing
a night ghost tour up here,

10:44.077 --> 10:45.710
which we rarely do.

10:45.712 --> 10:47.979
<i>It was a special event.</i>

10:50.783 --> 10:54.386
<i>[narrator] Suddenly, Cori sensed
a presence in one of the rooms.</i>

11:03.996 --> 11:08.333
There was a figure
who walked from one room

11:08.335 --> 11:11.036
across the hallway
to the other room.

11:11.937 --> 11:13.538
<i>It was Lidia.</i>

11:17.943 --> 11:21.079
<i>[narrator] But Cori was then drawn
to something even more sinister</i>

11:21.081 --> 11:23.214
<i>lurking in the shadows.</i>

11:25.084 --> 11:28.486
You could definitely feel
this heavy presence.

11:33.059 --> 11:36.027
There was a dark shadowy figure.

11:37.063 --> 11:39.030
<i>It really freaked me out.</i>

11:40.833 --> 11:42.901
Got the feeling that
it was time to leave,

11:42.903 --> 11:45.537
<i>and we left pretty quickly
after that.</i>

11:51.811 --> 11:55.747
[narrator] <i>No one knew
the identity of this dark spirit.</i>

11:55.749 --> 11:59.417
<i>Until a young bartender came
to work at the Red Onion.</i>

12:00.720 --> 12:04.689
<i>One day he saw a terrifying
scene played out in front of his eyes</i>

12:04.691 --> 12:08.059
<i>from the brothel's violent
gold rush days.</i>

12:09.762 --> 12:14.165
<i>The bartender said he witnessed
a stalky, surly male apparition.</i>

12:15.067 --> 12:17.836
[Cori]
<i>He saw him being a brute.</i>

12:17.838 --> 12:20.004
Being ruthless and brutal
with these women.

12:20.006 --> 12:22.140
Being violent and aggressive.

12:23.843 --> 12:26.945
[narrator] <i>And the bartender
was shocked by what he saw next.</i>

12:27.747 --> 12:30.348
So this kid is telling me
what he's seen.

12:39.558 --> 12:42.360
He had been stabbed
with a knife by a woman.

12:43.963 --> 12:46.131
<i>[narrator] The identity
of the murderer was unknown,</i>

12:46.133 --> 12:48.066
<i>but the bartender believed</i>

12:48.068 --> 12:50.602
<i>this brute was a bouncer
at the brothel</i>

12:50.604 --> 12:53.938
<i>and it's his steps that are
often heard haunting the hallway.</i>

12:53.940 --> 12:57.142
[footsteps]

12:58.144 --> 13:00.612
<i>His job was to keep
the clients to time</i>

13:00.614 --> 13:04.082
<i>and kick them out after
their 15 minutes of pleasure.</i>

13:06.085 --> 13:09.587
<i>The young employee never
recovered from what he had witnessed.</i>

13:12.825 --> 13:18.263
He was basically tormented
and had horrific dreams,

13:18.265 --> 13:22.801
nightmares, felt like the
presence here followed him home.

13:22.803 --> 13:25.804
<i>He ended up,
as a result, leaving.</i>

13:25.806 --> 13:29.607
He doesn't want anything to do
with Skagway or the Red Onion again.

13:29.609 --> 13:33.278
I can't blame him,
it was pretty terrifying.

13:33.280 --> 13:35.980
[narrator] <i>It seems the
forces of the Alaska triangle</i>

13:35.982 --> 13:38.449
<i>are set on driving out
the living</i>

13:39.618 --> 13:42.587
<i>and with Skagway's violent past,</i>

13:42.589 --> 13:45.990
<i>spirits of the dead seem
to stalk this town.</i>

13:48.761 --> 13:51.062
<i>That's why paranormal
investigator, Mike Cook,</i>

13:51.064 --> 13:55.333
<i>has made a special 800 mile
journey here from Anchorage.</i>

13:57.870 --> 13:59.737
<i>[Mike] I've always wanted
to come to Skagway,</i>

13:59.739 --> 14:02.941
it is one of the most
haunted cities in Alaska.

14:02.943 --> 14:07.011
<i>This is the place for paranormal</i>

14:07.013 --> 14:09.047
<i>and the fact
that I now have the chance</i>

14:09.049 --> 14:13.585
to be in Skagway
really is a dream come true.

14:15.554 --> 14:19.357
<i>[narrator] Tonight, Mike's planning an
investigation at the Red Onion Saloon.</i>

14:20.960 --> 14:23.595
<i>He wants to find out
more about the evil entity</i>

14:23.597 --> 14:26.364
<i>of the bouncer named John.</i>

14:28.868 --> 14:32.003
<i>And about the ghost
of working girl, Lidia.</i>

14:33.038 --> 14:37.408
<i>He wants to know why their
spirits seem to remain so restless.</i>

14:39.144 --> 14:41.880
I would really love
to meet Lidia tonight

14:41.882 --> 14:44.148
<i>to answer a lot
of questions that I have.</i>

14:44.150 --> 14:46.284
<i>Why did she hang herself?</i>

14:46.286 --> 14:51.723
I'd like to meet John and see
why he's doing what he's doing.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.125
It's up to the spirits,
but if they want me to know

14:54.127 --> 14:56.327
the true story,
they're going to tell it.

14:56.695 --> 14:59.030
So this is our main room...

14:59.032 --> 15:02.200
<i>[narrator] Mike meets the
brothel museum curator, Cori.</i>

15:02.202 --> 15:07.071
<i>And is given a tour so he knows what
to look out for during his investigation.</i>

15:08.007 --> 15:12.777
and this is where
Lidia is often seen.

15:12.779 --> 15:14.512
- In this corner?
- [Cori] In this corner.

15:14.514 --> 15:17.181
This is where
she's been seen hanging.

15:19.184 --> 15:23.388
[narrator] <i>Then, as darkness
falls, Mike begins setting up.</i>

15:26.592 --> 15:29.093
<i>Night vision cameras are
placed all over the saloon</i>

15:29.095 --> 15:32.897
<i>and brothel upstairs,
including Lidia's room</i>

15:32.899 --> 15:36.234
<i>and the hallway that's
stalked by the bouncer, John.</i>

15:39.838 --> 15:42.240
We'll have one set up for Lidia,

15:42.242 --> 15:44.175
one set up in the hallway,

15:44.177 --> 15:47.211
I definitely want
to get Lidia's area

15:47.213 --> 15:48.680
where she's shown up before.

15:48.682 --> 15:52.116
Maybe she'll appear
on camera for us.

15:52.118 --> 15:54.052
<i>[narrator] Mike also has
a ghost haunting scanner,</i>

15:54.054 --> 15:56.387
<i>called the REM-POD.</i>

15:56.389 --> 15:59.090
The REM-POD, it's got an
electromagnetic field around it,

15:59.092 --> 16:02.927
so anything that has some kind
of electricity to it, ghosts, spirits,

16:02.929 --> 16:04.862
anything that comes near this
will set it off.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.764
It's also got a temperature
sensor on the top,

16:06.766 --> 16:09.867
so if the temperature up here
changes, plus or minus five degrees,

16:09.869 --> 16:12.103
- we'll hear another audible tone.
- [device beeping]

16:12.105 --> 16:14.105
So we're going to go
set tis up this down the hall,

16:14.107 --> 16:17.342
'cause that's the most active
part of this whole place.

16:19.044 --> 16:21.612
<i>[narrator] Finally,
Mike sets his infrared camera</i>

16:21.614 --> 16:23.548
<i>to detect for apparitions.</i>

16:24.850 --> 16:27.552
<i>The dots on the wall
represents its laser beams.</i>

16:33.092 --> 16:35.560
<i>Mike's overnight
investigation begins</i>

16:37.262 --> 16:40.031
<i>in the most
haunted place in town.</i>

16:43.002 --> 16:45.203
I'm excited. Let's go.

16:53.045 --> 16:56.047
<i>[narrator] Mike settles down
to monitor his cameras.</i>

17:02.554 --> 17:04.188
Ooh.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.525
What you'll see here,
right there.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.828
Came out of the wall
and then shot that way.

17:10.830 --> 17:15.066
<i>[narrator] A strange orb descends
from the haunted brothel upstairs.</i>

17:17.136 --> 17:19.003
[Mike] Watch again.
It came from upstairs.

17:19.005 --> 17:22.607
There. Wham! And goes all
the way down and shoots.

17:27.813 --> 17:31.482
<i>[narrator] Then it seems a strange
force is at work in Lidia's room.</i>

17:32.851 --> 17:36.254
This camera is wigging out.
It's a brand new camera.

17:37.022 --> 17:40.058
<i>[narrator] This is
where she hung herself.</i>

17:40.060 --> 17:43.261
Her camera's off now.
Wait, it came right back on.

17:43.595 --> 17:45.496
Holy cow.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.766
<i>[narrator] Perhaps the spirits
of Skagway are trying</i>

17:48.768 --> 17:51.369
<i>to sabotage
Mike's investigation.</i>

17:53.839 --> 17:58.009
<i>Their plan may be to stir him off
course from digging any deeper.</i>

17:59.211 --> 18:02.146
<i>But soon,
Mike gets dangerously close</i>

18:02.148 --> 18:04.949
<i>to the brothel's darkest spirit.</i>

18:05.417 --> 18:07.018
[Mike]
What's your name?

18:08.020 --> 18:10.521
Whoa! My God!

18:22.568 --> 18:24.869
<i>[narrator] It's the dead
of night in Skagway,</i>

18:24.871 --> 18:28.272
<i>one of the most haunted
places in the Alaska triangle.</i>

18:29.575 --> 18:32.677
<i>In former gold rush brothel,
the Red Onion Saloon,</i>

18:32.679 --> 18:35.012
<i>paranormal investigator,
Mike Cook</i>

18:35.014 --> 18:38.416
<i>is trying to communicate with
the spirits who passed here.</i>

18:39.885 --> 18:42.487
<i>An aggressive bouncer, John,</i>

18:42.489 --> 18:45.022
<i>and a former prostitute, Lidia.</i>

18:47.126 --> 18:51.162
<i>But perhaps these entities
are hampering his investigation.</i>

18:53.765 --> 18:57.034
[Mike] Look at that!
The camera actually shut off.

18:57.036 --> 18:59.937
This is a brand new system.

18:59.939 --> 19:02.807
<i>[narrator] The interference
appears to come from Lidia's room,</i>

19:02.809 --> 19:04.442
<i>where she hung herself.</i>

19:07.446 --> 19:09.080
[Mike]
Wow. Look at this.

19:10.115 --> 19:11.282
Right there.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.652
[narrator]
<i>Mike spots some kind of orb.</i>

19:14.654 --> 19:16.721
[Mike] It literally
comes from where the light is

19:16.723 --> 19:19.290
and then just shoots
straight at the camera.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.392
I seriously feel like
there's somebody here,

19:21.394 --> 19:22.994
<i>but I just don't know who.</i>

19:25.964 --> 19:29.333
<i>[narrator] So Mike goes up to
Lidia's room to investigate.</i>

19:31.136 --> 19:33.971
[Mike] Ooh, it's strong
right now. It is strong.

19:34.840 --> 19:38.009
Who's up here?
Hey, Lidia, is that you?

19:39.978 --> 19:42.180
Whoever is up here,
I can feel you.

19:46.552 --> 19:48.386
[narrator]
<i>Using his spirit box,</i>

19:48.388 --> 19:53.090
<i>Mike listens for messages while it
scans the local radio frequencies.</i>

19:56.728 --> 19:59.463
[white noise]

20:03.202 --> 20:07.004
That was a female.
Lidia, is that you?

20:08.574 --> 20:11.142
[device beeping]

20:14.279 --> 20:16.581
[Mike] That is going nuts.

20:17.983 --> 20:20.885
<i>[narrator] Something's entered
the electromagnetic field,</i>

20:20.887 --> 20:23.454
<i>surrounding
Mike's REM-POD device.</i>

20:26.258 --> 20:29.193
[Mike] Lidia, is that you?
Can you make it go off again?

20:29.861 --> 20:30.828
That was--

20:30.830 --> 20:31.596
[device beeping]

20:31.598 --> 20:34.098
See? It responded.

20:34.666 --> 20:36.300
As soon as I said,
"Do it again."

20:42.975 --> 20:48.579
When people see her or
feel her they get a cold breeze

20:49.448 --> 20:50.481
and that's the...

20:50.483 --> 20:52.250
[beeping]

20:52.252 --> 20:55.086
That tone right there means there's
a five degree temperature change

20:55.088 --> 20:56.921
in the room.

20:56.923 --> 21:00.157
That's the area
where they've said

21:00.159 --> 21:02.960
they've seen her apparition
of her hanging.

21:04.229 --> 21:05.963
Lidia, did you hang yourself?

21:07.132 --> 21:09.066
There's something in this room.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.141
<i>[narrator] Minutes later,
a sound in the hallway.</i>

21:21.880 --> 21:23.314
I heard something.

21:23.316 --> 21:27.218
It was like a breath.
Like a... [exhales]

21:27.653 --> 21:28.853
Like someone's breathing.

21:33.058 --> 21:35.593
<i>[narrator] And this is the
same hallway that the ghost</i>

21:35.595 --> 21:39.897
<i>of the murdered bouncer,
John, is said to stalk.</i>

21:39.899 --> 21:41.999
John, is that you down
at the end of the hallway?

21:44.603 --> 21:45.903
No...

21:50.709 --> 21:53.477
It literally sounds like
somebody's walking down there.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.614
Like just back and forth.
Back and forth.

21:57.582 --> 21:58.949
<i>[narrator] If this is John,</i>

21:58.951 --> 22:03.154
<i>Mike senses him
moving downstairs to the bar.</i>

22:03.156 --> 22:05.890
<i>This is where the bouncer
kicked the clients out</i>

22:05.892 --> 22:09.894
<i>after their 15 minutes
spent in the brothel.</i>

22:09.896 --> 22:11.529
[Mike] Who's here with
us in the saloon?

22:11.863 --> 22:13.297
What's your name?

22:14.366 --> 22:17.368
[narrator] <i>Mike uses his
spirit box to reach out to him.</i>

22:18.437 --> 22:20.004
[indistinct whisper]

22:20.006 --> 22:22.306
Oh, my God!

22:22.808 --> 22:24.442
[white noise]

22:27.079 --> 22:27.945
<i>[narrator] On replay...</i>

22:27.947 --> 22:29.580
What's your name?

22:29.582 --> 22:31.449
<i>[narrator] it sounds
like the name "John."</i>

22:35.153 --> 22:37.388
Oh, my God!

22:39.057 --> 22:40.291
That was just...

22:43.028 --> 22:44.729
Who am I talking to?

22:44.731 --> 22:46.964
[white noise continues]

22:46.966 --> 22:50.368
[narrator] <i>But there's no more
word from the evil entity, John.</i>

22:52.037 --> 22:54.372
<i>So Mike considers
a change of tact,</i>

22:54.374 --> 22:56.607
<i>to try and communicate
with the spirits.</i>

22:57.809 --> 23:00.177
I want to turn the lights on
cause what I really want to do

23:00.179 --> 23:06.150
is get the atmosphere
the same as it was

23:06.152 --> 23:09.553
when people have seen
these apparitions

23:09.555 --> 23:11.355
or felt them or heard them.

23:13.825 --> 23:16.861
<i>[narrator] Mike moves the
electromagnetic sensing REM-POD</i>

23:16.863 --> 23:19.296
<i>into the hallway
where he heard footsteps.</i>

23:19.298 --> 23:21.365
<i>Perhaps from bouncer, John.</i>

23:23.201 --> 23:25.369
<i>Mike waits for a response.</i>

23:28.573 --> 23:29.740
[beeping]

23:29.742 --> 23:31.342
[Mike]
This thing is going nuts.

23:36.047 --> 23:39.116
It just stopped.
It just stopped.

23:39.985 --> 23:41.252
Everything was going off.

23:41.254 --> 23:43.320
That is the most
that we've seen tonight,

23:43.322 --> 23:44.989
and this is the hallway too.

23:45.857 --> 23:47.358
Holy cow.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.295
<i>[narrator] No more
from the REM-POD device,</i>

23:52.297 --> 23:53.964
<i>but in Lidia's room...</i>

23:54.966 --> 23:56.267
Whoa!

23:56.269 --> 23:59.804
Whoa, it's going off, man.
Something's over here.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.672
<i>[narrator] It seems
some kind of apparition</i>

24:01.674 --> 24:05.009
<i>has appeared on Mike's
infrared light sensor camera.</i>

24:06.611 --> 24:08.612
[Mike] <i>The way it
works is it actually emits</i>

24:08.614 --> 24:12.650
a infrared laser grid
and so anything that comes

24:12.652 --> 24:15.019
into that laser grid field
and manipulates the dots,

24:15.021 --> 24:18.055
<i>it'll actually outline
the apparition with that.</i>

24:18.057 --> 24:20.291
<i>[narrator] Any human shape
that's detected</i>

24:20.293 --> 24:23.894
<i>is shown on screen as
a stick-like figure.</i>

24:23.896 --> 24:27.431
<i>This strange form
could be Lidia herself.</i>

24:30.001 --> 24:33.137
[Mike] Wow. Lidia,
is that you?

24:33.139 --> 24:34.371
I think that that's a mirror.

24:34.373 --> 24:36.607
We're just seeing there's
a mirror and then...

24:38.143 --> 24:39.410
a lampshade.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.312
It's crazy, though.

24:41.314 --> 24:43.247
It's tracking
whatever's right there.

24:46.918 --> 24:49.820
Oh, my God.

24:49.822 --> 24:52.089
So it's looking
right here at this case

24:52.091 --> 24:54.191
and this lamp and this mirror.

24:54.693 --> 24:55.726
Now it's gone.

24:56.828 --> 25:01.065
Wait, there it is.
There it is again. Oh my God!

25:01.067 --> 25:04.301
<i>[narrator] Then, the
apparition seems to disappear.</i>

25:05.470 --> 25:08.105
[Mike] I'm not getting
anything right here any more.

25:10.842 --> 25:12.076
Whoa.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.978
What is it picking up now?

25:15.347 --> 25:17.081
That is over...

25:18.183 --> 25:19.950
That's over by Lidia's corner.

25:19.952 --> 25:22.019
That's pointing
at Lidia's corner.

25:23.221 --> 25:25.189
<i>[narrator] And this
is the corner of the room</i>

25:25.191 --> 25:27.424
<i>where Lidia's said
to have hung herself.</i>

25:30.929 --> 25:33.964
<i>Then it seems
the spirit vanishes.</i>

25:42.040 --> 25:45.209
<i>No more signs
from the ghost here,</i>

25:45.211 --> 25:49.547
<i>but for Mike, it's been a successful
evening at the Red Onion Saloon.</i>

25:51.983 --> 25:55.052
<i>It seems the entities
of evil bouncer, John,</i>

25:55.054 --> 25:57.721
<i>and working girl, Lidia,</i>

25:57.723 --> 26:01.058
<i>are both trying to send him
some kind of message.</i>

26:01.060 --> 26:03.794
I don't know
what exactly they said,

26:03.796 --> 26:06.163
but I do know they
were trying to communicate.

26:06.165 --> 26:08.032
So that was pretty interesting.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.768
<i>This place is phenomenal.</i>

26:10.770 --> 26:13.003
This place
definitely has spirits.

26:15.540 --> 26:17.074
[narrator]
<i>Mike calls it a night,</i>

26:17.076 --> 26:21.145
<i>knowing that he has plenty of
evidence to sift through back at base.</i>

26:22.581 --> 26:25.082
<i>But somewhere
amongst tonight's footage,</i>

26:25.084 --> 26:27.351
<i>there lies a chilling message.</i>

26:31.923 --> 26:33.958
Man, that is so clear.

26:33.960 --> 26:38.028
That's what makes
this clip so amazing.

26:52.177 --> 26:56.113
<i>[narrator] Skagway, perhaps
the most haunted gold rush town</i>

26:56.115 --> 26:58.015
<i>in North America.</i>

26:59.150 --> 27:01.385
<i>Paranormal investigator,
Mike Cook,</i>

27:01.387 --> 27:04.221
<i>had an eventful ghost hunt
at the former brothel,</i>

27:04.223 --> 27:06.023
<i>the Red Onion Saloon.</i>

27:08.860 --> 27:10.260
That was a female.

27:10.262 --> 27:13.430
Oh, my God!

27:15.734 --> 27:19.336
[narrator] <i>Now he's back at
base, pouring through the footage.</i>

27:20.071 --> 27:23.207
<i>He's found something
rather mysterious.</i>

27:25.176 --> 27:30.514
I had actually set this camera down
on the floor midway down the hallway.

27:32.550 --> 27:35.085
<i>I then went off
and did something else</i>

27:35.087 --> 27:37.187
<i>in a totally different part
of the saloon</i>

27:37.189 --> 27:39.590
and the noise that is caught

27:39.592 --> 27:43.193
on the mic of this camera
is pretty interesting.

27:47.432 --> 27:48.932
There was a loud "Bang!"

27:49.200 --> 27:51.335
And that got my attention.

27:55.573 --> 27:58.142
I said, "What is that?"

27:58.144 --> 28:01.478
[narrator] <i>The finger points
to the brothel's evil bouncer.</i>

28:03.281 --> 28:06.717
The bouncer is obviously
trying to get my attention.

28:06.719 --> 28:08.252
And then this happens.

28:10.355 --> 28:14.391
I found an electronic voice
phenomena that said this...

28:21.633 --> 28:24.568
"She made grave mistakes."

28:25.804 --> 28:29.073
<i>[narrator] An electronic
voice phenomenon, or EVP,</i>

28:29.075 --> 28:32.209
<i>is a recording captured
of a spirit's speech.</i>

28:36.014 --> 28:39.149
Man. That is so clear.

28:39.151 --> 28:42.286
You can clearly
hear the gentleman say,

28:42.288 --> 28:43.754
"She made a grave mistake."

28:43.756 --> 28:47.191
That's what makes
this clip so amazing.

28:48.193 --> 28:50.961
<i>[narrator] Mike is in no doubt
that this was a message</i>

28:50.963 --> 28:53.030
<i>from the ghost of the bouncer.</i>

28:53.865 --> 28:56.266
All of the evidence
that he is up there

28:56.268 --> 28:58.502
is right here and I got it all.

29:01.172 --> 29:03.006
<i>[narrator] This stunning
message could relate</i>

29:03.008 --> 29:04.975
<i>to one of the working women.</i>

29:06.044 --> 29:10.380
<i>Perhaps a victim of the
violent bouncer murdered him.</i>

29:10.382 --> 29:13.884
They got into an argument
and she stabs him,

29:13.886 --> 29:15.352
<i>and he died,</i>

29:15.354 --> 29:20.224
so he could be referring
to she made a grave mistake

29:20.859 --> 29:22.226
of stabbing him.

29:23.895 --> 29:26.063
<i>[narrator] But Mike
has another theory.</i>

29:27.165 --> 29:30.167
<i>The victim who sought revenge
could be the woman</i>

29:30.169 --> 29:36.140
<i>who is mercilessly branded
on her face, Lidia.</i>

29:38.042 --> 29:40.077
[Mike] <i>She couldn't make
money as a working girl,</i>

29:40.079 --> 29:42.913
the bouncer
was throwing her out.

29:42.915 --> 29:46.216
She probably got mad,
turned around, stabbed him

29:46.218 --> 29:48.852
and when she realized
that she had made

29:48.854 --> 29:51.655
the biggest mistake of
her life of killing somebody,

29:51.657 --> 29:54.258
that's when she probably
hung herself.

29:57.061 --> 29:59.196
<i>This could be
the entity of the bouncer</i>

29:59.198 --> 30:02.099
letting us know that Lidia
made a great mistake.

30:03.034 --> 30:05.035
Everything would add up.

30:07.906 --> 30:10.507
<i>[narrator] But this case
is not closed for Mike.</i>

30:11.109 --> 30:13.777
There's definitely
spirits there.

30:13.779 --> 30:15.979
<i>There's just more to that story</i>

30:15.981 --> 30:17.848
<i>and I feel they want to tell it,</i>

30:17.850 --> 30:21.485
which is why this
investigation is not over.

30:23.087 --> 30:24.888
<i>[narrator] And it seems
the Red Onion Saloon</i>

30:24.890 --> 30:27.191
<i>will always
rightly stake a claim</i>

30:27.193 --> 30:29.960
<i>as the most haunted place
in Alaska.</i>

30:31.963 --> 30:37.868
<i>But the evil in the triangle is perhaps
not only evident in the paranormal,</i>

30:37.870 --> 30:42.105
<i>it also manifest itself in creatures
that come out in the night.</i>

30:43.308 --> 30:46.176
<i>And even the smallest
of them are deadly.</i>

30:46.178 --> 30:48.011
[laughing]

30:59.791 --> 31:02.025
[narrator]
<i>The Alaska triangle.</i>

31:02.027 --> 31:04.127
<i>A place where
paranormal entities</i>

31:04.129 --> 31:06.430
<i>are said to stalk the forests.</i>

31:09.434 --> 31:12.970
<i>Legend tells of a tiny,
but deadly evil</i>

31:13.404 --> 31:15.239
<i>known as the little people.</i>

31:15.241 --> 31:16.940
[laughing]

31:18.276 --> 31:19.743
<i>[Lance] You have to be careful</i>

31:19.745 --> 31:21.979
because they could
steal your children,

31:21.981 --> 31:24.648
<i>they could vanish into thin air.</i>

31:24.650 --> 31:27.084
<i>[narrator] Perhaps
these sinister creatures</i>

31:27.086 --> 31:30.187
<i>play a part in Alaska's thousands
of strange disappearances.</i>

31:30.189 --> 31:32.222
[screaming]

31:32.224 --> 31:34.925
Here we have a newspaper
report that shows evidence

31:34.927 --> 31:38.729
for the abduction of humans
by little people.

31:38.731 --> 31:42.566
<i>There is definitely something
going on in the Alaska triangle.</i>

31:51.276 --> 31:54.111
<i>[narrator] Alaska,
thousands of square miles</i>

31:54.113 --> 31:56.980
<i>of unexplored terrain
and forest.</i>

32:00.919 --> 32:03.120
<i>But deep underground
there's supposedly</i>

32:03.122 --> 32:07.024
<i>an even murkier hidden
subterranean world.</i>

32:08.693 --> 32:11.461
<i>It's believed this is
where the Little People live.</i>

32:15.199 --> 32:17.034
<i>Cryptozoologist,
Lance Hightower,</i>

32:17.036 --> 32:20.203
<i>has been investigating
this sinister phenomenon.</i>

32:21.139 --> 32:24.241
All around the world
we have legends that exist

32:24.243 --> 32:27.210
<i>of gnomes,
leprechauns and the like.</i>

32:27.712 --> 32:28.979
<i>In the Alaska triangle,</i>

32:28.981 --> 32:32.182
<i>you have what's called,
"The Little People."</i>

32:32.184 --> 32:36.186
<i>Now, a lot of the locals say
that they are small in stature</i>

32:36.188 --> 32:38.855
but also have
superhuman strength.

32:38.857 --> 32:42.125
Such as being able to pick up
a boulder or a cariboo.

32:43.127 --> 32:45.028
<i>[narrator] Author and
researcher, Hugh Newman,</i>

32:45.030 --> 32:48.598
<i>has also been looking
into the legends.</i>

32:48.600 --> 32:51.168
There's been lots of stories
about who these people really are.

32:51.170 --> 32:55.205
Whether they're actual alive,
kind of small human beings,

32:55.207 --> 32:57.174
or whether they're
otherworldly beings

32:57.176 --> 32:59.576
<i>who just emerge at certain times</i>

32:59.578 --> 33:01.645
<i>when the veil is thin
between this world</i>

33:01.647 --> 33:03.180
<i>and the next world.</i>

33:04.882 --> 33:07.150
<i>These Little People
live underground,</i>

33:07.785 --> 33:09.353
<i>so you rarely see them.</i>

33:11.122 --> 33:15.158
<i>[narrator] But these terrifying
creatures may not be mere legend.</i>

33:16.427 --> 33:18.962
<i>Incredibly, there's believed
to be physical evidence</i>

33:18.964 --> 33:21.198
<i>that the Little People do exist.</i>

33:22.567 --> 33:25.635
<i>Mysterious, tiny,
tool-like objects</i>

33:25.637 --> 33:27.204
<i>close to an inch in length</i>

33:27.206 --> 33:31.241
<i>have been dug up by
archeologists all over North Alaska.</i>

33:33.044 --> 33:35.846
<i>In 2011, some were
found near Lake Matcharak</i>

33:35.848 --> 33:38.949
<i>in the gates
of the Arctic National Park.</i>

33:39.951 --> 33:43.487
[Hugh] <i>They found spear
heads, knives, different blades</i>

33:43.489 --> 33:45.922
and other such things,
which are so small

33:45.924 --> 33:49.893
that not only would normal sized
human beings find difficult to make,

33:49.895 --> 33:52.863
<i>using them would be
a whole other story and so,</i>

33:52.865 --> 33:54.865
<i>you know,
is this small toll tradition</i>

33:54.867 --> 33:57.067
<i>actually evidence
of Little People</i>

33:57.069 --> 33:59.202
<i>living in the Alaska area?</i>

33:59.971 --> 34:04.074
This could be proof that this
tiny race of people existed.

34:08.079 --> 34:11.114
[narrator] <i>But for native
Alaskans like Qituvituaq Litchard</i>

34:11.116 --> 34:14.284
<i>the proof comes from the
many stories of the Little People</i>

34:14.286 --> 34:17.187
<i>that strike terror
among the communities.</i>

34:18.723 --> 34:20.991
<i>Otherwise known
as the Ircenrraq,</i>

34:20.993 --> 34:25.562
<i>these creatures have a fearsome
reputation for stealing children.</i>

34:27.065 --> 34:30.367
They're often seen
by people in the villages.

34:30.369 --> 34:33.236
A lot of the population
has had encounters with them.

34:35.740 --> 34:38.375
<i>[narrator] One native woman
reported that her daughter</i>

34:38.377 --> 34:41.511
<i>was targeted by Little People
in the south of the triangle.</i>

34:43.748 --> 34:45.949
<i>[Hugh] There's a place
called Palmer in Alaska</i>

34:45.951 --> 34:52.122
in 2005 a little person was witnessed
running through the landscape.

34:54.092 --> 34:56.860
<i>[narrator] The young girl was
thought to be in the same area,</i>

34:56.862 --> 34:58.562
<i>alone and vulnerable.</i>

34:59.063 --> 35:01.465
[footsteps]

35:01.467 --> 35:05.001
She's way out in the country
and a little person came up to her...

35:05.036 --> 35:06.570
[laughs]

35:19.550 --> 35:21.184
<i>[narrator] Her mother
reported her missing.</i>

35:21.186 --> 35:23.653
[screaming]

35:23.655 --> 35:26.089
She completely disappeared
and was never seen again.

35:26.091 --> 35:28.992
And so the relationship
between these Little People

35:28.994 --> 35:32.062
and disappearances in
the Alaska triangle

35:32.064 --> 35:33.964
has become quite a big story

35:33.966 --> 35:37.801
and it suggests there might be
a connection between them.

35:37.803 --> 35:41.605
<i>[narrator] Where the girl was
taken, it seems no one knows.</i>

35:44.108 --> 35:48.211
<i>But one place in the southwest
edge of the Alaska triangle,</i>

35:48.213 --> 35:51.515
<i>Pilcher Mountain, has long
been linked to the Little People.</i>

35:52.917 --> 35:56.720
<i>Folklore says this is
where they have their base,</i>

35:56.722 --> 36:01.224
<i>deep underground, and small tools
have reportedly been found here.</i>

36:03.761 --> 36:05.795
<i>Cryptozoologist,
Cliff Barackman,</i>

36:05.797 --> 36:08.965
<i>believes there may be more
to the myth and legend.</i>

36:10.668 --> 36:13.170
The local people believed
that Pilcher Mountain

36:13.172 --> 36:16.072
is the place where
the Little People reside

36:16.074 --> 36:17.741
and that's where they come from,

36:17.743 --> 36:21.411
take people, take captives
and bring them back to there.

36:22.613 --> 36:25.081
<i>[narrator] And Cliff has found
what seems like evidence</i>

36:25.083 --> 36:27.817
<i>of one such kidnap
in near Pilcher Mountain</i>

36:27.819 --> 36:31.321
<i>in a local newspaper
article dated May, 2008.</i>

36:33.090 --> 36:35.792
Here we have a newspaper
report from 2008

36:35.794 --> 36:40.230
that shows evidence for the
abduction of humans by Little People.

36:40.232 --> 36:45.068
A very unusual story where a
hunter was out in a remote area,

36:45.070 --> 36:47.671
three hours walk
outside of town,

36:47.673 --> 36:50.207
and he stumbles
across a little boy.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.276
<i>[narrator] To add
further weight to the story,</i>

36:53.278 --> 36:55.579
<i>Qituvituaq Litchard
knows the hunter in south</i>

36:55.581 --> 36:58.114
<i>and he told him
what happened next.</i>

37:01.919 --> 37:05.121
[Qituvituaq] <i>He found a
child in the middle of nowhere.</i>

37:06.023 --> 37:08.358
The child was very confused
and disoriented.

37:12.463 --> 37:14.731
<i>He was wondering what
the heck this kid was doing</i>

37:14.733 --> 37:17.434
<i>in the middle of nowhere,
there's a lot of Grizzlies around.</i>

37:19.170 --> 37:21.938
<i>[narrator] While the hunter
gave him shelter,</i>

37:21.940 --> 37:24.341
<i>the boy had an incredible
story to tell.</i>

37:26.510 --> 37:28.945
[Hugh] <i>This little boy who
said he had been abducted</i>

37:28.947 --> 37:31.448
by Little People
and just been returned

37:31.450 --> 37:33.450
minutes before
the hunter found him.

37:34.986 --> 37:38.955
<i>All around the area he saw
no footprints in this marshy land.</i>

37:40.958 --> 37:43.126
<i>It's almost like he'd been
just dropped off there</i>

37:43.128 --> 37:45.962
from the strange place
that he just been.

37:48.666 --> 37:51.001
The kid starts telling a story,

37:51.003 --> 37:54.070
and he says that the Little
People took him underground.

37:55.873 --> 37:58.908
<i>[narrator] He said he was
taken to their subterranean base,</i>

37:58.910 --> 38:02.012
<i>deep into the earth,
below Pilcher Mountain.</i>

38:07.385 --> 38:10.186
They grabbed him and they
pulled him through the rocks,

38:10.188 --> 38:12.489
<i>and he was all of the sudden
in this tunnel.</i>

38:16.861 --> 38:19.195
He's brought into this huge,
massive room,

38:19.197 --> 38:20.563
filled with thousands of them.

38:25.870 --> 38:27.971
[laughter]

38:33.978 --> 38:37.280
<i>While he was there
he met a little girl.</i>

38:38.683 --> 38:41.518
[narrator] <i>What this girl
wanted, the boy did not know.</i>

38:42.953 --> 38:44.788
<i>But soon it seemed he'd find out</i>

38:44.790 --> 38:47.057
<i>what these demons
had done to her.</i>

38:48.225 --> 38:50.527
<i>The truth would be terrifying.</i>

39:03.874 --> 39:05.108
<i>[narrator] Pilcher Mountain,</i>

39:05.110 --> 39:08.044
<i>in the southwest
of the Alaska triangle.</i>

39:10.147 --> 39:12.816
<i>It's believed to be
a subterranean hideout</i>

39:12.818 --> 39:15.385
<i>for one of the most
demonic creatures in Alaska.</i>

39:17.688 --> 39:19.255
<i>The Little People.</i>

39:22.059 --> 39:25.695
<i>In May, 2008, they reportedly
kidnapped a boy</i>

39:25.697 --> 39:27.364
<i>and took him underground.</i>

39:29.066 --> 39:31.134
<i>Cryptozoologist,
Cliff Barackman,</i>

39:31.136 --> 39:35.038
<i>has found a newspaper report
about the incident.</i>

39:35.040 --> 39:39.109
During the boy's absence he
claimed to have met a little girl

39:39.111 --> 39:42.345
<i>who had been abducted
who begged him to help her.</i>

39:43.681 --> 39:46.850
<i>[narrator] The boy
discovered a cruel truth.</i>

39:46.852 --> 39:51.020
<i>They've been taken into another
dimension where time stood still.</i>

39:51.989 --> 39:56.493
They had kept this girl there for
40 years, yet she had not aged.

39:57.995 --> 40:01.097
<i>There've been people coming
in contact with these little people</i>

40:01.099 --> 40:02.732
<i>and there's time displacement,</i>

40:02.734 --> 40:06.002
there's missing time
that no one can account for.

40:08.005 --> 40:10.140
<i>[narrator] Tragically,
the little girl is said</i>

40:10.142 --> 40:13.543
<i>to have asked the boy to pass
on a message to her family.</i>

40:15.579 --> 40:17.914
The little girl wanted him
to talk to her family

40:17.916 --> 40:19.349
to tell them that she's okay.

40:20.217 --> 40:22.018
<i>[narrator] But as
40 years had passed,</i>

40:22.020 --> 40:24.587
<i>her family
were long dead and gone.</i>

40:28.259 --> 40:30.660
<i>It seems, however,
the little demons decided</i>

40:30.662 --> 40:34.497
<i>to release the boy
and spare his life.</i>

40:39.203 --> 40:41.905
<i>When he was found
and returned to his village,</i>

40:41.907 --> 40:45.175
<i>the story spread fear
across Alaska.</i>

40:47.578 --> 40:50.580
[Cliff] <i>It generated a huge
buzz all around Alaska</i>

40:50.582 --> 40:54.150
because for generations,
stories of these Little People

40:54.152 --> 40:56.986
have been out there and these
Little People abduct children.

40:56.988 --> 40:58.321
You would go, "What?

40:58.323 --> 41:01.191
These stories I've been
hearing for decades are true?

41:01.193 --> 41:03.159
Are my children safe?"

41:03.828 --> 41:06.095
<i>And here we are with
this newspaper report,</i>

41:06.097 --> 41:10.099
for everybody to see,
with multiple named witnesses.

41:10.101 --> 41:11.768
Well, that's some
pretty compelling evidence

41:11.770 --> 41:14.003
that something is going on.

41:15.105 --> 41:18.741
<i>[narrator] So if this is evidence
that these little demons do exist,</i>

41:18.743 --> 41:22.045
<i>then perhaps this is proof
that they've played some role</i>

41:22.047 --> 41:26.249
<i>in the strange disappearances
that have plagued the Alaska triangle.</i>

41:28.085 --> 41:29.719
If it is true that Little People

41:29.721 --> 41:32.956
are abducting humans
for whatever purpose,

41:32.958 --> 41:36.559
I don't think we're going to have any
shortage of missing people in the future.

41:37.895 --> 41:39.863
<i>[narrator] The missing boy
may have been saved,</i>

41:39.865 --> 41:42.765
<i>but others seem
to not have been so lucky</i>

41:42.767 --> 41:46.302
<i>when they've crossed paths
with these sinister creatures.</i>

41:48.105 --> 41:52.408
<i>The numbers of missing people
here seem on a relentless rise.</i>

41:53.444 --> 41:57.981
<i>It could only happen
in this place: Alaska.</i>
