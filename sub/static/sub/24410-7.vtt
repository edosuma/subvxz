00:02.960 --> 00:07.040
Jonna!
Would you like to meet up sometime?

00:07.440 --> 00:12.160
-Yes, absolutely. I'll call you.
-Great.

00:13.440 --> 00:18.440
-Why did it fire? I was taking it.
-It was an accident.

00:18.520 --> 00:23.840
I don't understand how it went off.
I was just taking it away from him.

00:37.280 --> 00:41.640
-What's up?
-Counterfeit money has been reported.

00:41.720 --> 00:47.840
They have the same serial number.
Keep it, my number's on the back.

00:47.920 --> 00:51.360
-Do you have more counterfeit money?
-Why?

00:51.440 --> 00:55.360
I have an old friend in Helsinki.

00:55.440 --> 01:00.600
If you sell it to him,
you'll get 30-35% of the value.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.160
But I want 10% for setting it up.

01:03.240 --> 01:06.520
-I'll call an ambulance!
-No, no ambulance, please!

01:06.600 --> 01:09.120
An ambulance would call the police.

01:09.200 --> 01:15.480
All I need is some antibiotics.
And I'm good. Alright?

01:15.560 --> 01:18.560
I'm Andrus, by the way.

01:40.160 --> 01:42.160
Hello.

01:47.040 --> 01:52.040
We can't go on like this, Liv.
Please say something.

01:55.080 --> 01:57.520
I want a divorce.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.840
Li...

02:58.840 --> 03:02.720
THICKER THAN WATER

03:40.240 --> 03:45.240
Are we going to go on pretending
that nothing's wrong?

03:45.320 --> 03:50.560
-What are you talking about?
-He's out there. He'll be found.

03:51.720 --> 03:54.920
It'll be a long time
before the ice melts.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.080
So we'll sit around waiting for that,
then?

03:58.160 --> 04:00.640
Yes.

04:00.720 --> 04:06.200
No one's looking for him, Jonna.
No one will miss him.

04:07.680 --> 04:12.560
You have no scruples left, do you?
No boundaries, nothing.

04:13.560 --> 04:18.360
-How do you do it? I want to know.
-Get a grip now.

04:18.440 --> 04:24.360
That's easier said than done. Unlike
you, I haven't done this before.

04:24.440 --> 04:27.600
No, you haven't been forced to.

04:28.480 --> 04:33.440
-Do you know how easy you've had it?
-What the hell do you know about it?

04:33.520 --> 04:38.520
When this is over, you'll leave.
So in comparison, you get away easy.

04:38.600 --> 04:42.840
But I'm the one who shot him.
I did it, Oskar.

05:19.320 --> 05:24.360
That policewoman,
why is she here all the time?

05:25.680 --> 05:32.000
I don't know. Because of Lasse, I
think. They've had dinner or a date.

05:32.080 --> 05:34.200
Of course.

05:35.840 --> 05:40.040
You haven't taken out the mince?

05:40.120 --> 05:42.400
No, I forgot.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.320
It's nothing serious, I hope?

05:52.280 --> 05:55.680
I can see you're not feeling
very well.

05:56.680 --> 05:58.000
-Want to talk about it?
-No.

06:00.040 --> 06:01.640
Okay.

06:07.920 --> 06:12.320
<i>There's no mince.</i>
<i>Haven't we ordered supplies?</i>

06:12.400 --> 06:16.120
<i>-Oskar!</i>
<i>-Yes, what is it?</i>

06:16.200 --> 06:20.600
-We have no supplies!
-The delivery is running late.

06:20.680 --> 06:23.600
Where is Lasse, did he oversleep?

06:23.680 --> 06:26.640
-No, he's gone.
-Where's he going?

06:34.560 --> 06:39.520
-Has your contact phoned you?
-No, not yet.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.440
Who is the guy?

06:44.160 --> 06:48.960
Iiro. He's a bit peculiar,
but he knows what he's doing.

06:50.280 --> 06:54.280
-Can we trust him?
-It'll be alright.

07:34.600 --> 07:37.240
I'm sorry.

07:58.760 --> 08:02.520
Hello? Konrad?

08:08.240 --> 08:10.240
Konrad?

08:58.080 --> 08:59.960
-Hi!
-Hi!

09:00.040 --> 09:03.160
Come here! Give.

09:06.840 --> 09:11.200
-Can I bum a smoke?
-Absolutely not.

09:11.280 --> 09:14.480
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.560
Have you talked to him? Fredrik.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.040
No, no one was there.
The house was empty.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.280
Come! Give.

09:31.520 --> 09:34.640
My goodness! Calm down.

09:37.560 --> 09:39.360
Calm down!

09:40.040 --> 09:43.000
What the hell happened?

09:43.920 --> 09:45.960
Calm down.

10:18.000 --> 10:23.920
-Liv, hello! Sorry to bother you...
-No counterfeit money today either.

10:25.240 --> 10:30.800
-Maybe that's not why you're here.
-No, actually not.

10:30.880 --> 10:36.000
I see. No, he's not here.
I don't know when he's coming back.

10:36.080 --> 10:42.920
-Are you looking for Dad?
-No, Konrad. Seen him lately?

10:43.000 --> 10:45.200
-No.
-No, just his dog.

10:46.800 --> 10:51.920
-When will he come and fetch the dog?
-He didn't leave it here, I found it.

10:52.000 --> 10:55.720
It was outside the house.

10:55.800 --> 11:02.560
If Konrad went away, do you know
where he might go or who he'd visit?

11:02.640 --> 11:06.560
Honestly,
I don't think he has anyone to visit.

11:06.640 --> 11:12.560
Oskar said he hunts. I heard a shot
the other day, he could be hunting.

11:20.160 --> 11:26.520
That down payment you got,
who did you give it to?

11:26.600 --> 11:31.640
-Why do you ask?
-I'm curious if it'll be a problem.

11:33.600 --> 11:37.560
How hot is the money?
Where did you get it?

11:37.640 --> 11:38.720
Don't worry about that.

11:40.720 --> 11:46.000
I worry about who's looking for it.
It's a lot of money, so I thought...

11:46.080 --> 11:50.160
Don't do that. Don't think. Don't.

11:53.680 --> 11:56.520
Have they contacted you yet?

12:04.240 --> 12:07.160
I'm going for a piss.

12:35.360 --> 12:40.240
-What's it for? Who's getting shot?
-What the hell are you talking about?

12:41.160 --> 12:43.680
-You're insane.
-Where are you going?

12:43.760 --> 12:49.520
-Sort this out on your own.
-Wait! Calm down, okay?

12:50.880 --> 12:55.960
-I've brought it as insurance.
-No, let's forget this.

12:56.040 --> 13:00.440
-No, we have to do this!
-I don't have to do anything!

13:00.520 --> 13:05.600
-Forget it and go back to Åland.
-I can't go back.

13:08.640 --> 13:13.960
I've been evicted from my flat,
the debt collector's coming after me,

13:14.040 --> 13:18.560
and all our stuff is locked
away in some storage facility.

13:19.560 --> 13:24.200
I had to come to Åland.
If the inn fails, I have nothing.

13:24.280 --> 13:29.760
-Why not ask Jonna or Oskar for help?
-Because they need my help.

13:30.360 --> 13:33.360
If I don't go through with this...

13:37.080 --> 13:42.480
If I don't go through with this,
there's no point in going back.

13:44.320 --> 13:48.160
-Was it him?
-Yes.

13:49.400 --> 13:51.520
Wille...

13:52.560 --> 13:56.120
Help me. I'm begging you.

14:03.240 --> 14:07.040
-I had to give it a chance, Petra.
-Did you come here just to say that?

14:08.200 --> 14:12.120
-Can I sit down?
-Sure, go ahead.

14:23.240 --> 14:28.000
I came here to say
that I made a mistake.

14:28.080 --> 14:33.280
I shouldn't have pushed you away,
and it should've been you and me.

14:36.560 --> 14:41.280
You realise that now, when Liv wants
a divorce? What a coincidence.

14:41.360 --> 14:47.560
That's not why. You know everything
about me and still wanted me.

14:47.640 --> 14:52.360
To love someone is not choosing
from a buffet, it's all or nothing.

14:52.440 --> 14:55.960
Yes, I know. I know.

14:56.040 --> 15:02.160
What we've had all these years, I've
never had with Liv. I see that now.

15:04.800 --> 15:08.200
And after Konrad, I've understood...

15:08.280 --> 15:12.520
What about him? That he's missing?

15:14.720 --> 15:20.560
-Konrad found Mauritz's body.
-What do you mean, found? In the bay?

15:20.640 --> 15:24.200
The storm must have
washed him ashore.

15:24.280 --> 15:29.640
-Did he go to the police?
-No. He came to us.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.120
Started blackmailing us. So...

15:39.320 --> 15:41.440
What?

15:43.000 --> 15:44.680
Did you kill Konrad?

15:47.840 --> 15:50.680
What do you think of me?

15:50.760 --> 15:53.280
So you don't know what's
happened to him?

15:59.280 --> 16:01.280
Petra...

16:03.560 --> 16:07.160
I want nothing more to do with you.

16:07.240 --> 16:08.960
-Petra...
-No, leave now.

16:18.160 --> 16:20.840
No. Leave.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.560
-Can you describe the noise?
-Loud.

16:33.640 --> 16:38.240
It sounded really close,
but then it faded away.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.840
-And it was just one shot?
-Yes.

16:42.840 --> 16:47.520
-Did you see anyone? Hear any voices?
-No.

16:53.280 --> 16:56.200
Are you always working?

16:56.280 --> 17:03.040
Not always, I hope. But too much
for a single mother, at least lately.

17:04.640 --> 17:11.440
-Have you always lived with your dad?
-Yes, it was easiest that way.

17:11.520 --> 17:14.520
You like him, don't you?

17:16.240 --> 17:21.200
-Maybe. Where is he, by the way?
-In Helsinki, with Wille.

17:22.000 --> 17:25.200
-Wille Ek?
-Yes, that's right.

17:25.280 --> 17:30.080
-Do they know each other?
-No, not really.

17:30.160 --> 17:34.320
-So what are they doing in Helsinki?
-Maybe something with the renovation.

17:35.080 --> 17:37.600
Wille's in charge of it.

17:39.120 --> 17:45.640
It's important. If Konrad comes back,
or you hear anything else, call me.

17:45.720 --> 17:49.640
-I will.
-Thanks for your help. Bye now!

18:02.800 --> 18:07.760
-Why was the policewoman here?
-They're looking for Konrad.

18:08.360 --> 18:11.280
I showed her where I heard the shot.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.120
-Hello!
-Hello.

18:44.360 --> 18:47.480
I was wondering if your offer
still stands.

18:48.840 --> 18:53.120
-If you still want to buy.
-Perhaps.

18:55.240 --> 18:59.200
How much are you prepared to pay?

18:59.280 --> 19:03.640
-You don't waste much time, do you?
-Thanks.

19:07.360 --> 19:10.320
Do your brothers know you're here?

19:10.400 --> 19:15.480
No one can afford to buy the others
out so I'll sell for the right price.

19:47.960 --> 19:49.680
This is good.

19:50.600 --> 19:53.200
-Did you sleep well?
-Mm.

19:53.280 --> 19:56.280
No bad dreams?

19:59.360 --> 20:01.160
I'm gonna show you how you eat these.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.520
-It's <i>pepparkakor.</i>
-What, you eat them in a certain way?

20:04.600 --> 20:05.800
Yeah, you do it like this.

20:08.760 --> 20:10.920
Are you breaking my heart?

20:12.480 --> 20:16.960
If you break it in three pieces,
you get to make a wish.

20:17.040 --> 20:20.040
Make a wish, right?

20:21.280 --> 20:24.480
-You're hitting it too hard.
-Well, you're hitting it too hard.

20:24.560 --> 20:26.800
No, I'm not!

20:29.480 --> 20:31.320
Are you okay?

20:34.360 --> 20:37.000
I forgot.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.200
Here.

20:44.400 --> 20:47.040
-Thank you.
-It's okay.

20:49.040 --> 20:55.920
Why are you afraid? Are you afraid
you'd like it if you stayed here?

20:56.000 --> 20:58.680
No.

20:58.760 --> 21:03.800
But I can't stay here.
It's not possible.

21:03.880 --> 21:06.480
Pity.

21:09.280 --> 21:12.920
-You want to sell and I want to buy.
-Yes.

21:13.000 --> 21:18.240
That's no problem.
I'll pay well, market price.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.160
There's just one small thing.

21:23.280 --> 21:26.200
If I buy your share,
I'll only own a third.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.880
My hands will be tied by
your brothers.

21:28.960 --> 21:34.920
So in order for me to be interested,
I'd need to buy another share.

21:35.000 --> 21:39.160
Which means one of
your brothers needs to sell.

21:40.160 --> 21:42.560
Okay. I can talk to Lasse.

21:44.840 --> 21:47.160
It's probably best to talk to him.

21:48.680 --> 21:52.440
If he doesn't want to sell,
is the deal off?

21:52.520 --> 21:58.280
Unfortunately. I'm a decent guy,
but I can't do things out of charity.

21:58.360 --> 22:02.400
I understand. I should get going.

22:03.240 --> 22:06.720
-We'll talk later.
-Yes. And Jonna...

22:06.800 --> 22:10.280
That man, Wille Ek,
is not to be trusted.

22:11.360 --> 22:14.080
-How do you know him?
-We've had dealings.

22:15.680 --> 22:20.840
-Wille Ek works for us, nothing else.
-I'm just saying.

22:22.400 --> 22:27.560
-I want you to be safe.
-Thanks, but I can manage.

22:27.640 --> 22:29.800
Good.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.720
Give it to me.

23:02.320 --> 23:04.920
It'll have to wait here.

23:31.480 --> 23:34.800
-Everything alright?
-Yes.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.840
I told you we'd meet again.

23:39.560 --> 23:41.960
-And you must be...
-Lasse.

23:42.760 --> 23:47.040
Lasse? Okay. Iira.

23:48.320 --> 23:49.400
Search them.

23:53.720 --> 23:57.160
Just to be safe.
No hard feelings.

23:59.920 --> 24:04.800
-Let's see what you have to offer.
-Lasse.

24:04.880 --> 24:10.440
I wouldn't want to have come
all this way for nothing.

24:15.760 --> 24:19.160
-This is no Monopoly money.
-No.

24:31.120 --> 24:32.800
Very good!

24:34.200 --> 24:37.280
Nice craftsmanship.

24:37.360 --> 24:42.840
I'm guessing it's Russian.

24:42.920 --> 24:45.760
There won't be a problem
offloading this.

24:47.600 --> 24:52.920
-So, um... where's our money?
-Your money?

24:53.000 --> 24:54.760
-Yeah.
-Why would I bring any money,

24:54.840 --> 24:56.520
when I've brought muscles?

24:57.480 --> 25:02.920
You may not know this, but, here in
Finland, it's every man for himself.

25:03.280 --> 25:04.480
Survival of the fittest.

25:07.160 --> 25:09.960
Okay, just this once.

25:11.600 --> 25:14.080
120,000...

25:15.160 --> 25:17.600
-Dollars.
-Dollars?

25:17.680 --> 25:21.600
No, no. No. We were supposed
to get paid in euros.

25:21.680 --> 25:26.000
We agreed on the price,
not the currency.

25:26.080 --> 25:29.000
-It's this or nothing.
-No. Are they even real?

25:29.080 --> 25:31.400
-Come on!
-I won't get ripped off!

25:31.480 --> 25:33.480
Go ahead, look at them.

25:34.080 --> 25:36.360
You seem to know your business...

25:36.440 --> 25:40.120
-Police!
-Damn! Run!

25:59.320 --> 26:01.640
-What now?
-I'll get Iiro!

26:01.720 --> 26:05.560
-No, you saw the cops!
-Those weren't real cops!

26:09.600 --> 26:14.480
Oh, good. Laura Nord,
this is Per Stenlund from CKP.

26:14.560 --> 26:17.960
-Hello, sorry to keep you waiting.
-No problem.

26:18.040 --> 26:22.480
-I'll leave you two, then.
-No, you can stay.

26:22.560 --> 26:28.080
These keep coming in. Same
serial number as the ones I sent you.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.520
The same manufacturer.

26:36.080 --> 26:39.920
Well made. Really well made.

26:40.000 --> 26:44.440
-Who might be behind this?
-Counterfeit rings.

26:44.520 --> 26:49.200
Probably from Russia or Estonia,
we've had them in Helsinki,

26:49.280 --> 26:50.360
but never on Åland.

26:50.440 --> 26:54.160
-It was only a matter of time.
-No.

26:54.240 --> 26:59.000
Åland is a transit place, way too
small to be an end destination.

26:59.080 --> 27:03.160
It's too risky.
The money just got caught on the way.

27:03.680 --> 27:08.680
-They've looked into Konrad Waldemar.
-We have nothing on him.

27:08.760 --> 27:13.320
I didn't think so. Konrad had
no idea the money was fake.

27:13.400 --> 27:18.760
What are you waiting for? Bring him
in and ask where he got the money.

27:18.840 --> 27:22.440
That could be tricky.
He's missing.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.040
No leads?

27:42.720 --> 27:45.000
Down! Get down on the ground!

27:47.080 --> 27:51.800
-Get down on the ground!
-Come on.

27:53.480 --> 27:56.640
-I know what you want.
-Give me the money.

27:57.000 --> 28:01.640
-You can have it.
-Slow. Slowly.

28:01.720 --> 28:03.680
You can have it.

28:06.480 --> 28:07.920
But you have to shoot me first.

28:08.400 --> 28:12.360
Come on! What are you waiting for?
Shoot!

28:12.440 --> 28:15.040
What are you waiting for? Shoot.

28:22.320 --> 28:27.600
You can leave. We have a Swede with
a death wish. I'll take care of it.

28:44.280 --> 28:47.720
We're going to play a little game.

28:47.800 --> 28:53.640
I call it... survival of the fastest.

28:53.720 --> 28:59.320
When I start counting,
you start to run.

28:59.400 --> 29:02.720
On three...

29:02.800 --> 29:07.480
-I will shoot.
-Please.

29:08.560 --> 29:14.400
One! Two!

29:24.800 --> 29:27.280
Come on! Hurry!

29:33.840 --> 29:35.760
Take the money.

29:40.480 --> 29:43.960
-Can I use your phone for a minute?
-Yeah.

29:44.040 --> 29:47.040
Sure.

29:49.920 --> 29:52.000
Thanks, I just need to make
one phone call.

29:52.080 --> 29:53.680
Yeah, okay.

30:06.120 --> 30:07.960
Yeah, it's me.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.600
So, when can I come home?

30:11.680 --> 30:16.560
<i>Not for a while. They've been asking</i>
<i>about you, and not just the police.</i>

30:16.640 --> 30:20.360
What the hell do I do?
I have no money.

30:20.440 --> 30:24.360
<i>You have to figure it out.</i>
<i>Just stay away.</i>

30:24.440 --> 30:29.840
<i>Wait, I have a number here.</i>
<i>Mischa's contact on Åland.</i>

30:40.560 --> 30:46.720
<i>Only use it in an emergency. You</i>
<i>don't know who you're dealing with.</i>

30:46.800 --> 30:50.240
<i>-And one more thing...</i>
<i>-Yes?</i>

30:50.320 --> 30:53.320
<i>Don't call again.</i>

31:04.440 --> 31:06.600
Liv?

31:09.320 --> 31:11.440
Liv!

31:28.360 --> 31:29.760
Damn.

31:44.160 --> 31:46.760
-So this is where you are.
-Yes.

31:46.840 --> 31:49.720
-Are you staying here?
-For now.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.920
I don't think that's a good idea.

31:52.000 --> 31:57.320
You're using a room that's
intended for guests.

31:57.400 --> 32:01.560
See me as a guest, then. You
can deduct the rent from my salary.

32:02.960 --> 32:06.600
-Your salary?
-Yes, isn't it about time I get paid?

32:06.680 --> 32:11.240
-Stop it, Liv.
-You exclude me on all levels.

32:11.320 --> 32:15.960
I'm not included anymore,
I don't run this business, so...

32:16.040 --> 32:17.800
I'm just a regular employee.

32:21.040 --> 32:24.000
Does this make it easier?

32:24.080 --> 32:28.680
You moving out here and making
up non-existing conflicts.

32:28.760 --> 32:29.880
Is it easier to leave?

32:34.440 --> 32:37.400
The dining room is full.
Your shift has already started.

32:45.960 --> 32:48.760
-Hello!
-Hello, Beatrice!

32:48.840 --> 32:53.800
We were just talking about you.
You've made it look lovely.

32:53.880 --> 32:56.000
Meet Ingemar.

32:56.080 --> 32:58.400
-Hello. Ingemar.
-Oskar.

32:58.480 --> 33:02.120
-Hello, Liv!
-Oh, hello!

33:02.200 --> 33:07.840
Tell us, we're so curious. Are you
planning on selling the place?

33:08.400 --> 33:11.360
-It's not just up to us.
-Of course.

33:12.240 --> 33:16.720
Good to have you back, though.
You belong here.

33:16.800 --> 33:23.240
If you need help with anything, legal
counsel or something, please come by.

33:23.320 --> 33:27.600
-Thank you.
-Where are the other siblings?

33:27.680 --> 33:32.240
Lasse is in Helsinki, I think.
He had to take care of something.

33:32.320 --> 33:37.080
-And Jonna?
-I don't know where she is, actually.

33:37.160 --> 33:42.360
-Excuse me. It was nice to meet you.
-I have to get back to work, too.

33:56.280 --> 34:01.000
Hey, thank you. Thank you for...

34:01.080 --> 34:03.600
coming back.

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
-I wouldn't have...
-I know.

34:12.680 --> 34:16.040
Are we going to talk or drink?

34:16.120 --> 34:18.960
Seriously...!

34:20.400 --> 34:23.480
You bloody Finn.

35:31.640 --> 35:32.880
Old memories.

35:44.280 --> 35:49.480
I want us to try again.
We have to give it a chance.

35:49.560 --> 35:55.640
-Just tell me what to do, and I will.
-It's not that simple.

35:55.720 --> 35:59.240
You can run the inn any way you like.

35:59.920 --> 36:05.600
If it's about Jonna or Lasse, I can
get them out tomorrow, if you want.

36:11.520 --> 36:12.880
It's probably too late for us.

36:16.040 --> 36:19.960
It's only too late if you
want it to be.

36:20.480 --> 36:24.320
If you've never really
believed in it.

36:24.400 --> 36:27.840
You don't want him to leave, do you?

36:27.920 --> 36:32.920
Lasse isn't the one who
destroyed our marriage.

36:33.000 --> 36:39.080
We, and only we, have done that.

36:39.160 --> 36:40.720
Then what are you doing in here?

36:55.560 --> 36:58.080
It's not possible to compete with it,
right?

37:00.760 --> 37:04.640
Nothing compares to
a person's first love.

37:06.160 --> 37:10.880
Nothing compares to what we've had.

37:11.960 --> 37:15.520
We've had a marriage.

37:19.520 --> 37:22.880
Your first love is always special.

37:22.960 --> 37:28.240
But it's only a fantasy.
It's never for real.

37:28.320 --> 37:30.640
Never?

37:31.720 --> 37:33.960
No.

37:35.920 --> 37:39.040
That's what I was afraid of.

37:42.120 --> 37:43.920
You were my first love.

38:21.840 --> 38:26.600
Sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

38:26.680 --> 38:30.520
-Go back to sleep.
-How am I doing?

38:30.600 --> 38:34.080
I think it's working.
Your fever's going down.

38:35.880 --> 38:39.120
Is there anything else
I can do for you?

38:39.200 --> 38:42.200
Actually...

38:46.920 --> 38:51.760
I wanted to ask for some money.
So that I could get outta here.

38:53.840 --> 38:59.600
I'll pay you back.
I'm not leaving today.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.600
Okay, well I'll get you the money.

39:07.480 --> 39:09.600
Thank you.

39:09.680 --> 39:13.760
-So you know some Swedish?
-Yeah...

39:14.760 --> 39:19.640
"Hello", "thank you",
"gingerbread cookies".

39:21.200 --> 39:22.240
Make a wish.

39:27.560 --> 39:29.520
Stay.

39:33.160 --> 39:36.160
Stay the night.

40:24.040 --> 40:29.560
-Hello! I need to talk to you.
-I am just on my way home.

40:29.640 --> 40:32.760
We're getting a divorce.

40:35.160 --> 40:38.280
Please help us get a fair
settlement.

40:38.360 --> 40:40.920
Yes, of course.

40:41.000 --> 40:45.960
I intend to claim what I have a
right to. I want a share in the inn.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.760
Liv!

41:26.600 --> 41:28.600
Open up!

41:31.720 --> 41:37.120
Is it too much to ask to know
what's going to happen now? Is it?

41:39.000 --> 41:42.000
This is all we have, Liv!

41:45.600 --> 41:48.600
This is all you have.

41:59.440 --> 42:03.520
-Hi, sweetheart!
<i>-Hi! Am I calling too late?</i>

42:03.600 --> 42:06.520
No, not at all. Don't worry.

42:06.600 --> 42:10.600
Mum hasn't been answering her phone.
Is everything okay?

42:11.240 --> 42:14.440
Yes, everything's fine.

42:14.520 --> 42:19.480
<i>It's our last week of school,</i>
<i>so I'll be home soon.</i>

42:19.560 --> 42:21.400
Dad, what do you want for Christmas?

42:22.920 --> 42:27.000
<i>-I don't know.</i>
<i>-Sure you do.</i>

42:29.000 --> 42:31.680
Well behaved children.

42:34.760 --> 42:37.760
Bye now. See you soon.

42:56.560 --> 43:00.560
