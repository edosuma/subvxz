14:21.202 --> 14:24.058
you're just
giving the advantage
to groups like HYDRA.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.342
You are not getting this,
are you?

14:26.372 --> 14:30.795
Weapons don't solve problems.
They only make problems worse.

14:30.825 --> 14:31.952
Wake up.

14:31.982 --> 14:33.443
How exactly do you
think our problems

14:33.473 --> 14:35.423
are going to get worse?

14:35.453 --> 14:38.349
You've seen what's out there.
The tech Hydra's got.

14:38.379 --> 14:40.396
Super-villains coming out
of the woodwork.

14:40.426 --> 14:42.421
Monsters like the Hulk.

14:42.451 --> 14:45.906
We need Tony Stark
more than we need
some armored vigilante.

14:45.936 --> 14:49.232
You can't do this alone.
You're only one man.

14:49.986 --> 14:52.180
One of me is more than enough.

14:52.620 --> 14:55.652
I'll get my tech back
on my own.

14:57.247 --> 14:58.450
[rifles cock]

14:58.480 --> 15:01.391
Do you really want
to go down this road, Fury?

15:05.461 --> 15:07.876
By the way,
there's about three dozen
unconscious HYDRA agents

15:07.906 --> 15:10.500
waiting for you down there.
No need to thank me.

15:10.530 --> 15:11.609
Sir, I--

15:11.639 --> 15:13.212
HYDRA got into our systems.

15:13.242 --> 15:15.572
We have a leak.
Find it and plug it.

15:15.602 --> 15:16.466
Yes, sir.

15:16.496 --> 15:18.931
And get me the Black Widow.

15:38.107 --> 15:39.398
Keep moving.

15:39.428 --> 15:41.340
You scum are heading
for the Vault.

15:46.117 --> 15:47.509
[Tony]
I'm not gonna
lie to you, Rhodey.

15:47.539 --> 15:49.245
There were three robots
this time

15:49.275 --> 15:51.393
and guys in robot suits.

15:51.771 --> 15:54.915
I tried to watch it on TV,
but Pepper wouldn't let me.

15:55.406 --> 15:57.596
She never watches.
I don't need to.

15:57.626 --> 16:00.192
I already know you're
gonna be late for your meeting.

16:01.551 --> 16:03.821
You don't have to do it alone,
you know?

16:04.820 --> 16:05.920
Do what?

16:05.950 --> 16:07.918
All this.
Taking on SHIELD.

16:07.948 --> 16:10.144
Giant robots.
Super-villains.

16:10.174 --> 16:12.937
The whole world doesn't have
to rest on your shoulders.

16:12.967 --> 16:14.333
Yeah, it does.

16:14.484 --> 16:17.256
I mean, I know you guys
are always there for me,

16:17.286 --> 16:18.702
but against this?

16:19.696 --> 16:21.180
Who's gonna help me?

16:52.952 --> 16:54.901
[Fury]
Move them out.

16:57.707 --> 16:59.217
Good to see you, Nick.

16:59.355 --> 17:02.130
But since when are you
overseeing prisoner drop-offs?

17:02.160 --> 17:05.811
Since HYDRA decided
to escalate their attacks
on pretty much everyone.

17:05.842 --> 17:08.026
Thought I'd check in
on our mutual friend,

17:08.056 --> 17:09.641
see what he knows.

17:09.779 --> 17:11.226
Hill, let's go.

17:13.138 --> 17:14.487
Tell me what you know.

17:15.050 --> 17:17.423
The Vault is the first
of the super-villain prisons

17:17.453 --> 17:18.707
specifically created to hold

17:18.737 --> 17:20.896
tech based criminals
and their gear.

17:20.925 --> 17:22.556
Designed by Tony Stark,

17:22.586 --> 17:25.659
until he decided to stop
working on SHIELD projects.

17:29.276 --> 17:30.861
Current high profile occupants

17:30.891 --> 17:33.339
include, Crimson Dynamo,

17:33.374 --> 17:36.028
Technovore,
MODOC, and--

17:36.058 --> 17:40.247
HYDRA's boss,
Baron Wolfgang Von Strucker.

17:47.121 --> 17:49.053
Herr Director.

17:49.083 --> 17:51.124
Clear.

17:51.158 --> 17:53.033
Clear.

17:56.071 --> 17:57.405
Clear.

17:58.487 --> 17:59.594
Sir?

18:00.222 --> 18:01.412
Hold on.

18:01.442 --> 18:02.662
Agent Woo.

18:03.304 --> 18:04.662
Look at his arm.
He's got an implant.

18:05.039 --> 18:05.978
Cyborg!

18:06.008 --> 18:08.351
Down on the ground now.

18:08.381 --> 18:10.255
<i>No need to panic, everyone.</i>

18:10.406 --> 18:13.123
<i>I've got a note</i>
<i>from my doctor.</i>

18:19.824 --> 18:21.020
Take him out!

18:21.050 --> 18:24.890
[SHIELD guards grunt]

18:24.924 --> 18:26.492
Yeah.

18:32.724 --> 18:36.216
Your questions amuse me,
Nicholas.

18:36.246 --> 18:38.895
A pleasure as always.

18:38.925 --> 18:40.292
We're done here.

18:41.689 --> 18:44.325
Did you really think he was
gonna tell you anything?

18:44.355 --> 18:46.138
You got a lot to learn, Maria.

18:46.168 --> 18:49.635
He told me plenty.
Something's down and soon.

18:49.665 --> 18:51.017
The question is what.

18:51.047 --> 18:52.904
[alarms sound]

18:52.934 --> 18:54.686
Woo, what's happening?

18:59.328 --> 19:03.212
Well, well,
the great Nick Fury.

19:03.488 --> 19:04.822
The Grim Reaper.

19:05.237 --> 19:06.507
It was a setup.

19:06.658 --> 19:08.853
The whole attack on the U.N.,
all of it.

19:09.079 --> 19:11.331
Just to spring Baron Strucker.

19:17.940 --> 19:19.236
[chuckles]

19:29.948 --> 19:31.067
[snaps]

19:54.437 --> 19:56.362
[groans]

19:56.500 --> 19:57.997
Hail HYDRA.

20:31.351 --> 20:33.437
Well, that was easy.

20:33.467 --> 20:35.328
You're not out yet.

20:35.358 --> 20:37.027
Fury!

20:37.057 --> 20:39.958
[chokes]

20:58.837 --> 21:00.858
Don't even think it, old man.

21:00.888 --> 21:02.636
[grunts]

21:04.944 --> 21:06.885
You're gonna suffer
for that, Fury.

21:29.509 --> 21:31.403
[laughs]

21:31.433 --> 21:33.319
That's it, run.

21:33.659 --> 21:34.107
Run--

21:34.137 --> 21:35.407
[device beeps]
Ooo.

22:05.189 --> 22:06.922
Assault, conspiracy,

22:06.952 --> 22:08.959
infiltrating
a government facility.

22:09.513 --> 22:12.217
You just broke into
your new home, Reaper.

22:14.075 --> 22:15.353
Director Fury,

22:15.383 --> 22:18.671
This place, the Cube,
the Big House,

22:18.701 --> 22:21.275
are all the super-villain
prisons like this?

22:21.305 --> 22:24.244
No, all four are different.

22:24.274 --> 22:25.406
Four?

22:26.962 --> 22:28.511
I thought there were
only three.
