00:00.595 --> 00:03.677
On this blockbusting
episode of "Mythbusters"

00:03.953 --> 00:05.466
Want to see something cool?

00:06.334 --> 00:07.920
It's "The Green Hornet" special.

00:07.921 --> 00:10.959
Narrator: Yep, sit back...
strap in...  whoa!

00:10.960 --> 00:15.309
And go green for an
all-access superhero special.

00:15.310 --> 00:15.939
Ta-da!

00:15.940 --> 00:17.066
It's science!

00:17.067 --> 00:19.303
First up, an explosive escape.

00:19.304 --> 00:22.582
In the movie, the explosion was
initiated by these eight rockets.

00:22.583 --> 00:26.177
Adam and Jamie want to know if you
were buried in a car grave... whoa!

00:26.178 --> 00:27.395
Whoo!

00:27.396 --> 00:31.259
Could you survive an underground
big boom...  let's blow it up.

00:31.260 --> 00:34.267
Narrator:... And would
it make a bulldozer fly?

00:34.268 --> 00:35.344
Ohh!

00:36.850 --> 00:42.680
Grant, and Tory take us on a wild
ride to tackle a two-part tall tale.

00:42.681 --> 00:44.486
You wanted the great
mother of all elevators?

00:44.487 --> 00:47.202
Narrator: Could an
elevator really cut a car?

00:47.727 --> 00:48.664
Whoa!

00:48.665 --> 00:50.490
And if it did...  eat my dust.

00:50.491 --> 00:51.983
Would it even be able to go?

00:51.984 --> 00:53.269
Go!

00:55.671 --> 00:57.616
Narrator: Who are the Mythbusters?

00:58.035 --> 00:58.986
Adam Savage...  aah!

00:58.987 --> 01:01.276
Am I missing an eyebrow?

01:01.277 --> 01:02.496
And Jamie Hyneman.

01:02.497 --> 01:03.383
Stand clear.

01:03.384 --> 01:04.652
I'm going hot.

01:04.842 --> 01:05.358
Between them,

01:05.358 --> 01:08.967
more than 30 years of
special-effects experience.

01:09.162 --> 01:14.135
Joining them... Kari
Byron...  are you ready?

01:14.136 --> 01:16.278
Tory Belleci...  this is real science.

01:16.279 --> 01:18.312
And Grant Imahara.

01:18.313 --> 01:19.324
I didn't train him to do that.

01:19.325 --> 01:21.454
They don't just tell the myths.

01:21.455 --> 01:23.937
They put them to the test.

01:31.484 --> 01:32.817
You know what I'd like to do?

01:32.818 --> 01:33.442
What?

01:33.443 --> 01:34.341
Something big.

01:34.342 --> 01:36.877
Like from a Hollywood blockbuster movie,

01:37.017 --> 01:38.462
like "The Green Hornet."

01:38.629 --> 01:39.266
You're dreaming.

01:39.267 --> 01:41.710
We're never gonna get
access to a movie like that.

01:41.811 --> 01:42.775
You're wrong.

01:43.050 --> 01:44.020
Am I?

01:44.185 --> 01:49.703
Yes... in fact... I have Seth Rogen right
here to prove to you how wrong you are.

01:50.685 --> 01:51.879
How did this happen?

01:51.880 --> 01:52.551
We're friends.

01:52.552 --> 01:53.475
We hang out.

01:53.938 --> 01:54.836
All the time.

01:54.837 --> 01:56.368
And by the way, you are wrong.

01:56.839 --> 01:58.427
Well, then, awesome!

01:58.428 --> 02:00.085
We get to bust myths from "Green Hornet."

02:00.086 --> 02:01.018
Nice!

02:01.019 --> 02:02.310
What have you got for us?

02:02.311 --> 02:03.082
Rather than tell you,

02:03.083 --> 02:06.040
I think it's much more
awesome if I show you.

02:06.129 --> 02:07.320
Roll the tape.

02:09.399 --> 02:10.102
In the movie,

02:10.103 --> 02:11.616
after his father is killed,

02:11.617 --> 02:16.688
Britt Reid decides to become masked
crime fighter The Green Hornet.

02:17.565 --> 02:18.778
With the help of Kato,

02:18.779 --> 02:20.284
his tech-savvy sidekick,

02:20.285 --> 02:22.641
and the black beauty...  whoa!

02:22.642 --> 02:26.572
Our newly minted superhero
takes on the bad guys.

02:26.573 --> 02:27.241
We could be heroes.

02:27.242 --> 02:29.380
And that brings us to the myth.

02:29.381 --> 02:30.317
In a key scene,

02:30.318 --> 02:33.462
the daring duo are
forced into a car grave,

02:33.463 --> 02:36.078
covered with dirt...
we are totally buried!

02:36.079 --> 02:38.443
And, to top it off, a bulldozer.

02:38.444 --> 02:40.352
However, Kato has a plan.

02:40.353 --> 02:42.557
Hiding behind the armored seating,

02:42.558 --> 02:46.132
they're going to detonate all
eight of the car's missiles,

02:46.133 --> 02:48.843
which has two dramatic consequences.

02:48.844 --> 02:51.972
First, the bulldozer gets blown skyward...

02:52.814 --> 02:56.495
[beeping]
And the dynamic duo escape unscathed.

02:56.795 --> 02:57.555
The question is,

02:57.556 --> 03:00.863
are either of those
outcomes even possible?

03:01.102 --> 03:02.365
What do you think, guys?
Where do we start?

03:02.366 --> 03:03.133
I'm glad you asked.

03:03.134 --> 03:04.369
Excuse me, Jamie.

03:04.370 --> 03:05.795
I think we just go for it.

03:05.796 --> 03:08.196
We match the movie
parameter for parameter.

03:08.197 --> 03:09.015
We dig a hole,

03:09.016 --> 03:10.012
we take the black beauty,

03:10.013 --> 03:11.487
strap some rockets on the front,

03:11.488 --> 03:13.919
put it in that hole with a couple
of dummies in the back seat...

03:13.920 --> 03:16.086
that's you and Kato...

03:16.177 --> 03:19.743
cover it with dirt... park
the bulldozer on the dirt.

03:19.744 --> 03:21.367
Blow the whole thing sky-high.

03:21.368 --> 03:21.948
That's right.

03:21.949 --> 03:24.548
And then we find out if
the explosives on the car

03:24.549 --> 03:26.440
are actually enough
to move this bulldozer.

03:26.441 --> 03:29.539
And whether or not me and
Kato can survive the blast.

03:31.321 --> 03:32.976
The gauntlet has been thrown,

03:32.977 --> 03:34.364
the challenge laid,

03:34.365 --> 03:35.198
and on location,

03:35.199 --> 03:39.839
the goal is to simulate the scene from
the movie as accurately as they can.

03:39.840 --> 03:43.638
Well, this looks like a safe
place to do some dangerous things.

03:43.639 --> 03:45.448
Let's go make some big booms.

03:45.786 --> 03:49.968
So it's full steam ahead for
the mother of all tnt parties,

03:49.969 --> 03:54.619
as the guys re-create Adam's
coffee-bean model in full scale.

03:54.620 --> 03:55.911
And here's how.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.009
Let's walk through the
elements of this test.

04:01.251 --> 04:02.527
This is our hole.

04:03.232 --> 04:05.484
This is the dirt we're
gonna use to fill it with.

04:06.043 --> 04:08.564
Hey, guys, I thought we
were gonna dig a big hole.

04:09.699 --> 04:12.264
I'm kidding. This is
clearly a very big hole.

04:12.304 --> 04:13.604
Congratulations.

04:14.432 --> 04:17.918
And this little baby right
here is the black beauty.

04:18.511 --> 04:19.947
Look at that.

04:19.964 --> 04:21.774
This is not the car we'll
be dropping in our hole,

04:21.776 --> 04:25.477
because this is one of the
five hero cars from the film,

04:25.478 --> 04:27.798
and we can't afford to destroy it.

04:29.580 --> 04:32.068
♪♪♪

04:32.069 --> 04:33.879
in the movie, the explosion was initiated

04:33.880 --> 04:36.263
by these eight rockets here in the front.

04:36.264 --> 04:40.618
Now, each one of them is about 4
inches thick and about 21 inches long.

04:40.619 --> 04:42.887
I figure that leaves us enough room for,

04:42.888 --> 04:47.430
say, a couple pounds of something
like tnt in the head of each one.

04:47.808 --> 04:50.323
And this is our bulldozer.

04:51.116 --> 04:51.794
These are our heroes,

04:51.795 --> 04:53.194
Kato and The Green Hornet.

04:53.195 --> 04:56.062
They're gonna be in the black
beauty behind the back seat.

04:56.633 --> 04:58.123
Now, if the scene in "Green Hornet"

04:58.124 --> 05:00.241
actually does comply
with the laws of physics,

05:00.242 --> 05:02.813
two things have to happen when we try it.

05:02.814 --> 05:03.586
One,

05:03.587 --> 05:05.633
that bulldozer has to fly up in the air

05:05.634 --> 05:08.381
and off of the spot that
it was formerly occupying.

05:08.382 --> 05:09.461
And, two,

05:09.502 --> 05:12.584
our heroes have to survive that blast.

05:12.585 --> 05:14.513
So, those are the raw ingredients.

05:14.514 --> 05:17.501
Now to put them together and get cooking.

05:17.502 --> 05:20.284
A key detail we haven't
shown you from the movie

05:20.285 --> 05:22.764
is that Kato had armored the car.

05:22.765 --> 05:26.604
He'd beefed up the seats that the
heroes hide behind during the blast.

05:26.605 --> 05:27.996
And if it's in the movie,

05:27.997 --> 05:29.113
it's in the test.

05:29.114 --> 05:31.521
Do you think this is the kind of
armor Kato would have put in the car?

05:31.522 --> 05:34.659
I think duct tape is the
key to any good experiment.

05:34.660 --> 05:35.590
I totally agree.

05:35.591 --> 05:38.542
Next, with the green
hornet and Kato in place,

05:38.543 --> 05:41.022
Adam adds pressure sensors to their chests

05:41.023 --> 05:43.871
that will tell us if the
explosion is survivable.

05:43.872 --> 05:47.511
My only question is how can this machine
tell you anything if it's exploded?

05:47.512 --> 05:50.650
Because the electrical signal
travels faster than the explosion.

05:50.651 --> 05:51.529
There you go!

05:51.530 --> 05:52.058
Who knew?

05:52.059 --> 05:54.134
Ta-da! It's science!

05:55.009 --> 05:59.386
Yep, the sensors are wired up to a
remote station so that after the blast,

05:59.387 --> 06:00.889
the team will have hard data

06:00.890 --> 06:04.099
on the kind of forces our
dummies were exposed to.

06:04.100 --> 06:05.833
Let's get friendly, Kato.

06:06.011 --> 06:08.378
I've always dreamed of taping us together.

06:08.641 --> 06:10.789
I think Seth is doing
very well, don't you?

06:13.199 --> 06:14.111
Nice!

06:16.456 --> 06:17.931
all right. Let's do it.

06:19.551 --> 06:21.784
That's the cue for the bomb crew.

06:21.785 --> 06:24.124
Okay, let's give this thing a tune-up.

06:24.852 --> 06:25.738
Okay.

06:25.744 --> 06:29.768
The black beauty had 16 pounds of high
explosives loaded into the front of it.

06:29.769 --> 06:32.534
Seth, want to play
"blow up crap" jump rope?

06:32.745 --> 06:33.735
I'm good.

06:34.301 --> 06:36.212
Now, to put that into context,

06:36.213 --> 06:40.155
that's the equivalent of the
amount of explosives in 10 grenades.

06:40.156 --> 06:41.694
So when that goes off,

06:41.695 --> 06:42.902
it's big trouble.

06:43.325 --> 06:45.544
What is stopping us from
putting this car in this hole?

06:45.545 --> 06:46.677
Absolutely nothing at all.

06:46.678 --> 06:47.546
Let's do it.

06:47.547 --> 06:48.837
Jamie, let's do it!

06:49.331 --> 06:54.333
That's the next step... maneuvering the
stand-in black beauty up and into the hole,

06:54.334 --> 06:56.203
which, like everything else in the test,

06:56.204 --> 06:59.579
exactly matches the dimensions
of the one in the movie.

06:59.580 --> 07:01.930
It's impressive that Jamie
dug this with his hands.

07:01.931 --> 07:03.813
But even though the setup is the same,

07:03.814 --> 07:06.541
Adam doesn't think the result will be.

07:06.542 --> 07:07.272
A prediction?

07:07.273 --> 07:09.138
Yeah, I've got a prediction on this one.

07:09.139 --> 07:12.174
Actually, don't get me wrong...
I love being surprised by the fact

07:12.175 --> 07:16.160
that sometimes movie physics actually
comply with the laws of real physics.

07:16.169 --> 07:17.961
Let's fill the hole, Jamie!

07:18.835 --> 07:20.869
But I don't think that is so in this case.

07:20.870 --> 07:24.387
I think that bulldozer's gonna
stay exactly where it was.

07:24.388 --> 07:26.046
I don't think the blast is gonna move it,

07:26.047 --> 07:29.111
and I also think that our heroes
are going to die in that blast.

07:29.112 --> 07:30.112
Sorry, guys.

07:30.263 --> 07:32.173
Whoa!  Whoo!

07:34.493 --> 07:36.481
let's bring in the dozer.

07:36.829 --> 07:39.544
I think, that when they set off this bomb,

07:39.545 --> 07:44.317
exactly what happens in the
movie is gonna happen... exactly.

07:44.622 --> 07:46.286
Okay, go around and push.

07:46.759 --> 07:47.750
I hope I'm right.

07:47.751 --> 07:49.893
If I don't, I'm gonna feel really stupid.

07:49.894 --> 07:51.607
Well, it's over the hole.

07:51.770 --> 07:53.005
Let's go push the button.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.116
Let's get safe.

08:02.892 --> 08:04.413
So, I hear you have a
"Green Hornet" myth for us.

08:04.414 --> 08:05.181
I sure do.

08:05.182 --> 08:06.231
Here's the myth.

08:06.232 --> 08:07.289
The black beauty, our car,

08:07.290 --> 08:09.389
has been riddled with
bullets in a car chase.

08:09.390 --> 08:11.723
We drive into an elevator to escape.

08:11.724 --> 08:13.522
The elevator lifts up our car,

08:13.523 --> 08:17.384
and the back half of it actually gets
sheared off as the elevator goes up.

08:17.385 --> 08:20.828
But the front half of the car is
able to drive out of the elevator,

08:20.829 --> 08:21.844
keep on going.

08:21.845 --> 08:22.382
Now, wait a minute.

08:22.383 --> 08:24.336
Isn't the black beauty
a Chrysler Imperial?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.187
Sure is.

08:25.188 --> 08:27.025
Well, those are
rear-wheel-drive cars.

08:27.026 --> 08:28.066
If we cut the back end off,

08:28.067 --> 08:29.954
won't the front end just sit there?

08:29.955 --> 08:30.764
It would,

08:30.765 --> 08:32.759
had my amazing partner, Kato,

08:32.760 --> 08:34.703
not made our car
front-wheel-drive.

08:34.703 --> 08:35.712
He's tricky like that.

08:35.712 --> 08:36.794
Kato magic.

08:36.794 --> 08:38.270
Okay, it sounds like a good story for us.

08:38.270 --> 08:40.894
Can a bullet-ridden car be
cut in half by an elevator?

08:40.895 --> 08:42.773
And can it still drive afterwards?

08:43.977 --> 08:45.028
[beep]
Drop me by the elevators!

08:45.029 --> 08:46.542
I'll take it from here!

08:46.543 --> 08:48.538
After the black beauty has been shot up,

08:48.539 --> 08:53.752
it takes an unintentional ride in
an elevator...  does it drive?

08:53.753 --> 08:54.339
Front-wheel drive.

08:54.340 --> 08:56.584
Which leads to a two-part question...

08:56.585 --> 08:59.655
would the car really bifurcate like this?

08:59.656 --> 09:02.900
And, given that it's been
converted to front-wheel-drive,

09:02.901 --> 09:06.492
could it actually make
good its two-wheeled escape?

09:07.609 --> 09:09.102
So, can you guys
actually do this, or what?

09:09.103 --> 09:09.681
Oh, yeah,

09:09.682 --> 09:12.086
we're gonna build our own freight
elevator and just go for it.

09:12.087 --> 09:14.366
Yeah. You know what? This is gonna
be pretty straightforward to test.

09:14.367 --> 09:15.902
We'll just drive the car halfway in,

09:15.903 --> 09:17.440
push the "up" button,
and see what happens.

09:17.441 --> 09:18.001
But you know what?

09:18.002 --> 09:20.262
First we need to get our
own Chrysler imperial,

09:20.263 --> 09:22.036
then give it a black beauty makeover,

09:22.037 --> 09:24.226
and then fill it full of holes.

09:24.230 --> 09:25.057
Have fun.

09:25.058 --> 09:26.928
I'll be waiting right in this room.

09:27.625 --> 09:29.266
I don't care how long it takes.

09:29.916 --> 09:31.901
He seems nicer in the movies.

09:34.109 --> 09:35.813
While Seth waits for results,

09:35.814 --> 09:37.962
Grant gets busy with the delivery.

09:38.473 --> 09:40.736
Now, that's a pretty car.

09:40.799 --> 09:43.003
And to transform her
into the black beauty,

09:43.004 --> 09:46.190
she needs a film-prop
makeover from an expert.

09:46.191 --> 09:48.414
Step up, Kari Byron.

09:48.415 --> 09:51.910
I got a little bit of intel on
the black beauty from the movie.

09:52.003 --> 09:56.865
Now, they used as many as 29 of this
identical classic car to shoot the movie.

09:56.866 --> 09:58.299
They needed them for all sorts of uses.

09:58.300 --> 09:59.907
They needed one in
pristine, original condition.

09:59.908 --> 10:01.054
They needed one to shoot up.

10:01.055 --> 10:02.114
They needed one with guns on it,

10:02.115 --> 10:03.490
one to squish.

10:03.653 --> 10:07.462
Our black beauty is going to meet
its death in our elevator rig.

10:07.626 --> 10:10.576
Not before I trick it out a
little bit black beauty style.

10:11.354 --> 10:12.726
When I see all the work

10:12.727 --> 10:16.815
that Kari's put into making this look
like an exact replica of the black beauty,

10:16.948 --> 10:19.848
it... it kind of breaks my heart.

10:19.854 --> 10:21.759
I don't want to see it destroyed.

10:22.571 --> 10:24.668
Kari reluctantly hands it over,

10:24.669 --> 10:27.767
because after the boys
take it on one last joyride,

10:27.768 --> 10:31.984
this dead car driving will
be facing the firing squad.

10:32.527 --> 10:36.153
Oh [bleep] [laughs]  Whoo-hoo!

10:36.723 --> 10:39.637
I think we forgot to install the
parking brake on the black beauty.

10:39.638 --> 10:42.116
Ah, well, I ain't Kato.

10:43.660 --> 10:45.791
Now it's time to get to the
science of this experiment,

10:45.792 --> 10:46.514
and that is,

10:46.515 --> 10:48.336
we have to shoot this car

10:48.571 --> 10:51.995
with the hopes that we weaken
the structural integrity

10:51.996 --> 10:54.052
that will give us the best
fighting chance of cutting this car

10:54.053 --> 10:55.624
in half with an elevator.

10:55.751 --> 10:59.580
It pains me to think that we're
gonna shoot something this beautiful.

10:59.581 --> 11:01.784
And the only thing that
gives me any consolation is

11:01.785 --> 11:05.243
the fact that we're gonna be
using submachine guns to do it.

11:05.685 --> 11:07.192
I think I'll get over it.

11:08.057 --> 11:10.037
Oh, I can't believe we're gonna do this.

11:10.038 --> 11:11.421
All right, you ready?

11:11.633 --> 11:12.564
No.

11:12.565 --> 11:13.998
Here we go!

11:14.079 --> 11:17.503
In three, two, one! Fire!

11:23.898 --> 11:27.065
Their goal is to match the
movie scene shot for shot.

11:27.066 --> 11:30.443
If the black beauty on-screen
had over 200 bullet holes,

11:30.444 --> 11:32.250
well, there's will, too.

11:37.633 --> 11:38.647
Clear!

11:39.311 --> 11:40.604
We started off with 25 rounds.

11:40.605 --> 11:41.420
We moved up to 50.

11:41.421 --> 11:45.460
Finally we got all the
way up to 270 rounds.

11:45.461 --> 11:46.525
But, I mean, I'm looking at it,

11:46.526 --> 11:49.721
and I still see a lot of steel
holding this car together.

11:49.722 --> 11:53.021
I don't think we've done enough
structural damage with those rounds

11:53.083 --> 11:55.438
to actually cut this car with an elevator.

11:55.694 --> 11:59.578
If there's a circle of hell for
people who destroy beautiful cars ...

11:59.965 --> 12:01.359
That's where we're going.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.079
This is the black beauty.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.206
Let's go find some crime.

12:09.207 --> 12:11.084
Let's go find an elevator.

12:11.101 --> 12:12.022
Yeah.

12:14.479 --> 12:15.727
Next on "Mythbusters"

12:15.728 --> 12:17.967
Three, two, one!

12:17.968 --> 12:20.328
Can a bulldozer fly?

12:21.220 --> 12:23.637
[laughter]
And can an elevator cut a car?

12:23.727 --> 12:24.909
Second floor,

12:25.107 --> 12:26.497
ladies' lingerie.

12:34.912 --> 12:38.537
Adam and Jamie are about to find out
if this scene from "The Green Hornet"

12:38.538 --> 12:41.736
is fact or superhero hype.

12:42.118 --> 12:42.765
Specifically,

12:42.766 --> 12:44.637
they've got two questions.

12:44.638 --> 12:46.967
Would the black beauty's
eight rockets have been enough

12:46.968 --> 12:49.660
to move the bulldozer up, up, and away?

12:51.258 --> 12:54.292
Second, hidden behind the armored seating,

12:54.293 --> 12:57.392
would our heroes have survived the blast?

12:58.805 --> 12:59.955
With Seth Rogen,

12:59.956 --> 13:01.429
the film star and writer,

13:01.430 --> 13:02.677
on hand to help,

13:02.678 --> 13:05.614
the team has matched the
movie criteria exactly,

13:05.615 --> 13:07.684
and we're about to find out.

13:08.186 --> 13:09.576
All right, this is "Green Hornet,"

13:09.577 --> 13:10.728
the actual test,

13:10.729 --> 13:12.610
going for broke... in three,

13:12.611 --> 13:15.578
two... one... fire!

13:19.424 --> 13:20.349
Look at that!

13:21.194 --> 13:23.079
That is... that is huge!

13:23.145 --> 13:24.492
Where's the bulldozer?

13:24.493 --> 13:26.137
It's not where it was.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.130
For a brief moment,

13:27.131 --> 13:29.108
with the dust cloud obscuring the scene,

13:29.109 --> 13:32.162
the team thought it had
blown away the bulldozer,

13:32.163 --> 13:35.909
but with a clear view
comes a sinking feeling.

13:36.188 --> 13:36.965
Is that it?

13:36.966 --> 13:38.199
Oh, no.

13:38.714 --> 13:39.899
It blew up a pocket,

13:39.900 --> 13:40.533
and then it sunk in the hole.

13:40.534 --> 13:42.033
Yeah, it fell in.

13:44.768 --> 13:47.081
That was a lot bigger
than I thought it would be.

13:48.187 --> 13:52.265
Yep, this wasn't a gasoline-fueled
movie special effect.

13:53.453 --> 13:55.177
So, you've been around
movie-set explosions.

13:55.178 --> 13:57.676
How does our real-world one stack up?

13:57.733 --> 13:58.432
It was scary.

13:58.433 --> 14:00.144
There was a lot less fire in it,

14:00.145 --> 14:03.088
which makes me think it's actually
probably a lot more destructive.

14:03.089 --> 14:04.196
You could kind of feel it a bit.

14:04.197 --> 14:06.043
You had to get way farther away from it,

14:06.044 --> 14:08.627
which also made me think
it was more dangerous.

14:08.641 --> 14:10.987
But it was completely horrifying.

14:11.204 --> 14:12.117
Good.

14:14.947 --> 14:17.304
I think we're gonna
need some bigger shovels.

14:18.658 --> 14:20.828
♪♪♪

14:22.095 --> 14:24.382
♪♪♪

14:25.015 --> 14:25.917
well, as you can see,

14:25.918 --> 14:28.943
the loader is still here
and still on top of the car.

14:28.944 --> 14:30.381
It's down in the hole, though,

14:30.382 --> 14:31.410
and it kind of makes sense,

14:31.411 --> 14:34.398
because energy's gonna follow
the path of least resistance,

14:34.399 --> 14:35.717
and in this case,

14:35.880 --> 14:36.678
that's the dirt.

14:36.679 --> 14:38.454
It pushed all the dirt out of the way.

14:38.455 --> 14:40.140
The loader fell in the hole.

14:40.152 --> 14:41.663
Well, there's your problem.

14:42.887 --> 14:44.741
♪♪♪

14:44.742 --> 14:49.230
one was that the loader had to fly
up in the air and away from the hole,

14:49.231 --> 14:52.705
and the other is that our heroes
inside the car lived through the blast.

14:52.706 --> 14:56.343
I think it's pretty clear that
the first part is totally busted.

14:56.344 --> 14:58.423
It's now time to get this
first part out of the way

14:58.424 --> 15:00.797
so that we can check on the second.

15:01.611 --> 15:05.019
Cue the heavy machinery to
remove the heavy machinery.

15:05.020 --> 15:06.519
And with the dozer out the way,

15:06.520 --> 15:10.058
the guys get down and dirty
to look for our heroes.

15:10.115 --> 15:15.952
But the initial evidence... twisted scraps
of anonymous car... does not bode well.

15:16.552 --> 15:17.700
That does not look good.

15:17.701 --> 15:21.546
Plus the black beauty seems to
be buried deeper than before,

15:21.547 --> 15:23.200
and they call for reinforcements.

15:23.201 --> 15:25.260
Can we get something bigger than me?

15:27.303 --> 15:28.403
Awesome!

15:30.059 --> 15:32.953
Yeah, for delicate
archeological precision,

15:32.954 --> 15:35.067
don't call the Mythbusters.

15:36.620 --> 15:39.400
But as each piece of
mangled wreckage emerges,

15:39.401 --> 15:43.429
it becomes increasingly clear any
hope for part two of the myth...

15:43.430 --> 15:46.581
hero survivability... is dying.

15:46.582 --> 15:49.007
Things are not boding
well for britt and Kato.

15:49.784 --> 15:50.942
Oh, man!

15:51.276 --> 15:52.893
It's like soup in there.

15:53.247 --> 15:56.780
Superhero soup with black beauty croutons.

16:00.873 --> 16:02.233
Dude, I think that's pretty definitive.

16:02.234 --> 16:03.256
You guys are dead.

16:03.257 --> 16:04.935
Yeah, it pains me to admit it,

16:04.936 --> 16:05.821
but we're toast.

16:05.822 --> 16:06.897
Toast.

16:06.970 --> 16:08.724
When the dummies are finally found,

16:08.725 --> 16:10.992
the visual evidence is so conclusive,

16:10.993 --> 16:15.133
the team doesn't even need the
hard data from the pressure sensors,

16:15.134 --> 16:15.835
which is lucky,

16:15.836 --> 16:17.889
because they didn't make it, either.

16:17.890 --> 16:19.603
This explosion was pretty full-on.

16:19.604 --> 16:20.907
In fact,

16:20.908 --> 16:23.820
it was so full-on that
it destroyed our sensors.

16:23.821 --> 16:26.982
So we don't have any exact
measurements of what happened here,

16:26.983 --> 16:28.508
but just looking at it,

16:28.509 --> 16:33.983
it's kind of like the car was
scrambled like scrambled eggs.

16:34.035 --> 16:36.690
And, looking at our dummy....

16:37.396 --> 16:38.854
He's pretty well scrambled, too.

16:38.855 --> 16:41.546
And that means it's conclusion time.

16:42.222 --> 16:43.973
Well, in the movie,

16:43.974 --> 16:45.869
the bulldozer gets
blasted way up in the air,

16:45.870 --> 16:50.267
and me and Kato climb out of
the car without a scratch on us.

16:50.268 --> 16:52.468
In real life, the bulldozer
didn't move at all,

16:52.469 --> 16:55.223
and me and Kato would have
been blown to smithereens.

16:55.238 --> 16:57.330
All this tells me is if you
want to make a good movie,

16:57.331 --> 17:00.688
the first thing you got to do
is throw reality out the window.

17:01.285 --> 17:02.683
That's what I've learned.

17:02.882 --> 17:04.355
So, Seth, what does this
mean for "The Green Hornet"?

17:04.356 --> 17:07.320
Are you planning any rewrites to
accommodate the laws of physics?

17:07.398 --> 17:08.300
Absolutely not.

17:08.300 --> 17:09.135
The real question is,

17:09.136 --> 17:10.794
what does this mean for your show?

17:10.943 --> 17:12.930
Well, it means that your
movie physics didn't line up

17:12.931 --> 17:14.827
with real physics on two accounts...

17:14.828 --> 17:17.119
and that you would have been
toast if you were in that car...

17:17.121 --> 17:20.111
and it didn't remove the
bulldozer from the scene.

17:20.176 --> 17:22.117
Yes, and that means part two of the myth,

17:22.117 --> 17:23.636
like our heroes,

17:23.637 --> 17:25.003
is dead and buried.

17:25.005 --> 17:28.153
There is simply no way
they would have survived.

17:28.154 --> 17:32.695
But re-creating the bulldozer's
flight is still in their sights.

17:32.731 --> 17:34.575
Now the only question for us is,

17:34.576 --> 17:37.559
what would it take to
get that bulldozer to fly?

17:37.560 --> 17:38.134
Awesome.

17:38.135 --> 17:38.849
I think so.

17:38.850 --> 17:39.785
Let's go.

17:44.964 --> 17:45.984
Kari, Grant, and Tory,

17:45.985 --> 17:48.510
arriving in their
bullet-riddled black beauty,

17:48.511 --> 17:50.864
are about to test the "Green Hornet"

17:50.865 --> 17:53.216
car-cleaving conundrum.

17:54.000 --> 17:55.466
We're in the welding bay at hunter's point

17:55.467 --> 17:57.277
so that we can test the
myth from "The Green Hornet"

17:57.278 --> 18:00.045
that a car can be cut
in half by an elevator.

18:01.293 --> 18:03.245
[beep] Now, in the movie,
this wasn't just any old elevator.

18:03.246 --> 18:04.656
This was a big glass elevator

18:04.657 --> 18:07.012
that the black beauty
crashed through the side of

18:07.013 --> 18:09.448
and then got cut in half not
by the elevator's door frame,

18:09.449 --> 18:11.594
but actually by the ceiling.

18:11.890 --> 18:15.121
Now, we couldn't find any
elevator like this at all anywhere,

18:15.122 --> 18:16.882
so in "Mythbusters" fashion,

18:16.883 --> 18:18.311
we're going to create our own.

18:18.335 --> 18:18.978
And to do it,

18:18.979 --> 18:23.689
they've brought in over 3.5 tons of
steel for the elevator's structure

18:23.690 --> 18:27.013
and a forklift to provide the lift's lift.

18:28.676 --> 18:32.242
What I have here is a small-scale
model of what we're gonna be building.

18:32.243 --> 18:34.678
Now, these pieces here
will all be steel "I"

18:34.679 --> 18:36.562
beams... and across the top and the back.

18:36.563 --> 18:40.304
Now, the ceiling in the movie will be
represented by a steel trench plate,

18:40.305 --> 18:41.276
which we'll weld to the top.

18:41.277 --> 18:44.505
So all this is gonna be welded
to the steel floor below us,

18:44.506 --> 18:46.296
which is embedded in the concrete.

18:46.297 --> 18:49.102
Now, it's important that this
thing is structurally sound,

18:49.103 --> 18:51.301
because when that forklift
starts lifting the car,

18:51.302 --> 18:54.439
there's going to be a lot of
force exerted on this structure,

18:54.440 --> 18:56.436
and it cannot move.

18:57.194 --> 18:59.725
With the three steel
beams lifted, shifted,

18:59.726 --> 19:04.126
and welded securely... and the
elevator-floor trench plate in position,

19:04.127 --> 19:07.566
the elevator replica is
just about good to go.

19:09.380 --> 19:11.432
You wanted the great
mother of all elevators?

19:11.433 --> 19:12.200
Well, you got it!

19:12.201 --> 19:14.521
Behind me is 3.5 tons of steel,

19:14.522 --> 19:17.223
over 50 linear feet of welds.

19:17.224 --> 19:22.260
Now, a regular service elevator has a
lift capacity of about 10,000 pounds.

19:22.623 --> 19:25.973
The forklift that we're
using has 3.5 times that.

19:25.974 --> 19:27.829
If this can't cut the car in half,

19:27.830 --> 19:29.821
no elevator on earth will.

19:29.822 --> 19:32.660
Second floor, ladies' lingerie.

19:34.020 --> 19:35.619
Meanwhile, down on the ground floor,

19:35.620 --> 19:38.167
black beauty is maneuvered into position.

19:38.938 --> 19:40.411
We're about to put our car into place,

19:40.412 --> 19:41.894
but we've drained all the fluids,

19:41.895 --> 19:44.344
so we need some heavy
machinery to get it over there.

19:44.345 --> 19:48.022
And somebody shot up the tires.

19:48.212 --> 19:49.182
All right.

19:49.739 --> 19:50.693
We're in the elevator.

19:50.694 --> 19:52.478
Which means it's go time.

19:52.851 --> 19:54.630
Okay, this is "The Green Hornet"

19:54.631 --> 20:00.134
black beauty bifurcation by
elevator in three, two, one, go!

20:06.929 --> 20:08.894
Do it! Do it!

20:09.158 --> 20:10.088
Stop!

20:10.122 --> 20:11.812
Yeah!

20:11.813 --> 20:12.387
You know what?

20:12.388 --> 20:14.181
There's no way this is happening.

20:14.182 --> 20:15.095
No way.

20:15.096 --> 20:18.536
I mean, that is way more
powerful than a regular elevator,

20:18.537 --> 20:21.352
and we still were not able
to cut that car in half.

20:21.353 --> 20:22.988
But power isn't really the point.

20:22.989 --> 20:24.313
As Grant explains,

20:24.314 --> 20:27.441
it's about the way that power is applied.

20:29.401 --> 20:32.047
So, we set everything up just
like they had it in the movie.

20:32.048 --> 20:32.593
And, you know what,

20:32.594 --> 20:33.965
to get that sort of effect...

20:33.966 --> 20:37.798
that back end of the car being
chopped off and falling down...

20:37.799 --> 20:39.373
you need a cutting force.

20:39.374 --> 20:42.367
What we have here is a crushing force.

20:42.368 --> 20:43.360
This is amazing!

20:43.361 --> 20:44.674
Look at this!

20:44.738 --> 20:46.065
All right, that is a smashed car.

20:46.066 --> 20:47.507
That is not a car cut in half.

20:47.508 --> 20:50.390
And that was an unrealistic
amount of force that we put on it.

20:50.391 --> 20:51.367
Okay, I feel pretty good about

20:51.368 --> 20:53.946
going back to Seth and
saying that this is busted.

20:53.947 --> 20:56.259
Good luck. I don't think we're
gonna be able to convince him.

20:57.292 --> 20:58.911
Coming up next on "Mythbusters,"

20:58.912 --> 21:01.372
our car insurance gets revoked again.

21:01.373 --> 21:02.457
You realize when you cut the cable,

21:02.458 --> 21:04.672
the emergency brakes don't work anymore.

21:12.341 --> 21:14.159
So, Seth, I hate to break it to you,

21:14.160 --> 21:16.181
but it looks like your
movie myth is kind of busted.

21:16.182 --> 21:16.881
Hmm?

21:16.882 --> 21:20.097
Even after reducing the structural
integrity with the machine guns,

21:20.098 --> 21:21.837
it's still not cutting in half.

21:21.890 --> 21:23.633
Well, not so fast.

21:23.634 --> 21:25.466
'Cause I forgot to tell you
something very important,

21:25.467 --> 21:27.869
and that is not only did Kato
make the car front-wheel-drive,

21:27.870 --> 21:30.885
he also installed the special zipper
system that cuts the car in half,

21:30.886 --> 21:32.191
should that ever come up.

21:32.192 --> 21:32.947
Really?

21:32.948 --> 21:33.828
Oh, really.

21:33.829 --> 21:35.670
Yes, we are very clever, us superheroes.

21:35.671 --> 21:36.554
Ah, well, all right,

21:36.555 --> 21:38.024
so, how are we gonna continue?

21:38.025 --> 21:38.915
Well, I think it's pretty obvious.

21:38.916 --> 21:41.222
We need to cut a car in half
using conventional tools,

21:41.223 --> 21:42.135
not an elevator.

21:42.136 --> 21:43.229
Cheese graters.

21:43.230 --> 21:45.282
Or possibly demo saws,

21:45.283 --> 21:48.601
blowtorches... and then just see
how far we can drive our half car.

21:48.602 --> 21:49.439
And this time,

21:49.440 --> 21:50.956
no more superhero excuses.

21:50.957 --> 21:53.792
I'm not gonna need them,
'cause it's gonna work.

21:55.389 --> 21:57.976
So, now that's the
challenge. Does it drive?

21:57.977 --> 21:59.110
Front-wheel drive.

21:59.111 --> 22:03.259
Is it really possible that the front
half could make good its escape,

22:03.260 --> 22:05.831
or is this scene Hollywood hyperbole?

22:05.832 --> 22:07.422
You can let me out!

22:07.545 --> 22:08.284
So, obviously,

22:08.285 --> 22:11.691
the black beauty did not get cut in
half quite like it happened in the movie,

22:11.692 --> 22:13.450
so if we're gonna replicate this myth

22:13.451 --> 22:16.124
and cut a car in half and
try to drive it around,

22:16.125 --> 22:18.706
we're gonna have to do it
the old-fashioned way... big,

22:18.707 --> 22:20.308
destructive tools.

22:20.309 --> 22:21.613
This is gonna be fun.

22:22.163 --> 22:23.082
But here's the catch...

22:23.083 --> 22:26.629
the black beauty and most cars
of that era had rear-wheel drive.

22:26.630 --> 22:28.131
So, we had to skip ahead a few decades

22:28.132 --> 22:30.930
to get this gorgeous land yacht here,

22:30.978 --> 22:33.830
which I have fondly
named the black hoopty.

22:34.061 --> 22:38.353
So, rather than do a Kato and
reconfigure a rear-wheel-drive imperial,

22:38.354 --> 22:42.947
the Mythbusters' chop shop is going
to hack in half the black hoopty.

22:43.937 --> 22:46.453
Now, the way we're gonna do that...
we're gonna roll it on its side,

22:46.454 --> 22:47.566
take the doors off,

22:47.567 --> 22:49.004
cut through the bottom first,

22:49.005 --> 22:50.683
then the top and the sides.

22:50.684 --> 22:54.720
It's important to note that although they've
removed the gas tank for safety's sake,

22:54.721 --> 22:56.244
when it comes to the test,

22:56.245 --> 23:01.537
the residual fuel in the lines and engine
should be enough to get the motor running.

23:02.682 --> 23:03.777
Whoo!

23:03.863 --> 23:04.838
The question is,

23:04.839 --> 23:07.086
will the team be able to drive it?

23:07.087 --> 23:08.111
Yeah!

23:08.112 --> 23:09.604
Now we're gonna flip the car on its side

23:09.605 --> 23:12.214
so that we can get easier access
to the hardest part to cut,

23:12.215 --> 23:13.690
which is the chassis.

23:13.767 --> 23:14.731
Gorgeous.

23:14.902 --> 23:16.420
Beautiful.

23:17.160 --> 23:18.058
Whoo!

23:18.231 --> 23:20.468
Let's chop this car up!

23:20.469 --> 23:22.078
With the finishing line in sight,

23:22.079 --> 23:27.666
the team releases its inner destructive
demons in a demo-saw massacre.

23:29.142 --> 23:31.795
Whoo!

23:32.062 --> 23:33.757
Now, that's a car cut in half!

23:33.758 --> 23:34.548
Yeah!

23:34.549 --> 23:35.502
Look at that.

23:35.503 --> 23:36.847
Ha ha!

23:36.848 --> 23:38.284
That was awesome.

23:38.671 --> 23:40.843
Let's see if the front end will drive.

23:41.356 --> 23:43.253
But Tory's not confident.

23:43.254 --> 23:43.882
After all,

23:43.883 --> 23:46.242
they removed the engine's energy source.

23:46.243 --> 23:48.548
Now, we know the engine and the
drive wheels are in the front,

23:48.549 --> 23:51.850
however, the gas tank with
the fuel pump is in the back,

23:51.851 --> 23:53.146
and they're no longer connected.

23:53.147 --> 23:54.482
You like my new car?

23:54.483 --> 23:55.822
Got a lot of leg room.

23:55.823 --> 23:57.952
I mean, we might be able
to start this car up,

23:57.953 --> 24:00.104
but I doubt we're gonna be
able to drive it for long.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.514
Meanwhile, our resident "glass half full"

24:02.515 --> 24:05.036
proponent is more confident.

24:05.263 --> 24:07.102
I feel like there's a strong possibility

24:07.103 --> 24:08.635
that we're gonna be
able to drive this car.

24:08.636 --> 24:11.145
Not very far... okay, you ready?

24:11.526 --> 24:14.291
But I feel like if there's
still a little fuel in there

24:14.292 --> 24:16.232
and we cut everything properly,

24:16.233 --> 24:17.729
we might get a little bit of a ride.

24:17.730 --> 24:18.638
But at first,

24:18.639 --> 24:20.606
they can't even get it started.

24:20.607 --> 24:22.009
Try to turn it over.

24:24.116 --> 24:26.335
However, they're not giving up yet.

24:26.336 --> 24:29.899
Thinking that there should be some
residual gas in the fuel lines,

24:29.900 --> 24:32.127
it may just be a starter problem,

24:32.128 --> 24:36.173
so Tory squirts starter fluid
directly into the carburetor.

24:37.345 --> 24:39.660
Close, but not so far.

24:39.806 --> 24:41.922
We moved like two inches!

24:42.231 --> 24:42.822
Come on! Go again!

24:42.823 --> 24:43.826
To match the movie,

24:43.827 --> 24:47.211
they really need to drive
the car a reasonable distance.

24:47.212 --> 24:48.049
If they don't,

24:48.050 --> 24:51.022
you could say the myth has hit the wall.

24:52.467 --> 24:53.195
Go for it!

24:53.196 --> 24:55.049
Yeah ha ha!

24:57.817 --> 24:59.310
Whoo-hoo!

24:59.514 --> 25:00.514
Whoa!

25:01.308 --> 25:03.132
Yeah!

25:03.281 --> 25:04.336
No brakes!

25:04.337 --> 25:05.364
Whoo!

25:05.936 --> 25:08.132
We drove through the wall!

25:08.315 --> 25:09.835
Yeah!

25:09.912 --> 25:11.115
Nice!

25:13.242 --> 25:13.889
So, in summary,

25:13.890 --> 25:16.418
the car started and even got
car started and even got going...

25:16.419 --> 25:17.949
until it hit the wall.

25:17.950 --> 25:20.274
But let's face facts...
with the fuel lines cut,

25:20.275 --> 25:22.736
it wasn't ever going to get very far.

25:22.737 --> 25:25.781
And that must mean the myth is busted,

25:25.782 --> 25:27.822
unless, back at the shop,

25:27.823 --> 25:32.132
Seth has any more excuses
up his superhero sleeve.

25:32.672 --> 25:35.971
Coming up, Adam and Jamie
play with toy tractors.

25:36.277 --> 25:36.895
Whoa!

25:36.896 --> 25:38.403
And high explosives.

25:38.404 --> 25:42.497
That was quite an awesome thud.

25:47.189 --> 25:48.651
So, where do we go from here?

25:48.652 --> 25:51.788
Well, clearly me and Kato are
dead and the bulldozer didn't fly,

25:51.789 --> 25:53.370
so you guys got a lot of work to do.

25:53.371 --> 25:54.239
Yes, we do.

25:54.240 --> 25:55.955
Well, to get that bulldozer airborne,

25:55.956 --> 25:57.343
we need more explosives.

25:57.344 --> 25:58.078
Awesome.

25:58.079 --> 26:00.244
And I think we need to
break it down to small scale.

26:00.245 --> 26:02.090
Let's figure out the
best set of parameters

26:02.091 --> 26:05.000
that gives us the most amount
of movement out of that dozer.

26:05.001 --> 26:06.153
While you guys do that,

26:06.154 --> 26:08.468
I'm required back on my private island.

26:08.469 --> 26:10.190
I will check in later to get the results.

26:10.191 --> 26:11.091
Have fun.

26:12.144 --> 26:13.191
Private island?

26:13.192 --> 26:14.550
I go there all the time.

26:14.551 --> 26:15.106
Really?

26:15.107 --> 26:16.057
It's nice.

26:19.265 --> 26:22.260
Clearly, having the heroes
survive an underground blast

26:22.261 --> 26:25.117
like the one in the movie is impossible.

26:26.234 --> 26:29.717
But getting a bulldozer to fly may not be.

26:30.842 --> 26:31.824
So, from here on in,

26:31.825 --> 26:34.981
Adam and Jamie will be
focusing on that alone,

26:34.982 --> 26:36.977
and, starting in small scale,

26:36.978 --> 26:39.262
they want to know which type of explosive

26:39.263 --> 26:42.080
has the best heavy-lifting qualities.

26:44.023 --> 26:45.831
♪♪♪

26:45.832 --> 26:47.941
♪♪♪

26:47.942 --> 26:49.738
♪♪♪

26:49.739 --> 26:54.643
we have two 110-pound steel bulldozers,

26:54.644 --> 26:58.605
and we've got two types of explosives...
4 pounds of high-speed explosive,

26:58.606 --> 27:00.233
4 pounds of low-speed explosive,

27:00.234 --> 27:04.627
and we are looking for which one of
these will throw our bulldozers high

27:04.628 --> 27:08.387
in the air without shredding
them to little, tiny bits.

27:08.695 --> 27:09.974
First up is this right here,

27:09.975 --> 27:13.139
which is tnt or trinitrotoluene.

27:13.140 --> 27:15.902
Now, this has an underground
detonation velocity

27:15.903 --> 27:18.357
of about 25,000 feet per second,

27:18.358 --> 27:20.150
and it's what you might call your average,

27:20.151 --> 27:22.910
middle-of-the-road
high explosive.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.635
For comparative purposes,

27:24.636 --> 27:26.930
the charge for both of
the small-scale tests

27:26.931 --> 27:29.346
will be buried at the same depth.

27:29.599 --> 27:31.026
And as per the movie,

27:31.027 --> 27:33.654
the bulldozer is positioned on top.

27:33.655 --> 27:36.529
Now, let's find out
exactly what tnt can do.

27:36.530 --> 27:38.385
Fire in the hole!

27:39.597 --> 27:44.169
4 pounds of tnt in three, two, one!

27:47.130 --> 27:49.722
Hey, that was a big piece
of shrapnel over there.

27:49.723 --> 27:50.573
Yeah.

27:50.587 --> 27:51.395
Ho!

27:51.770 --> 27:52.920
It's still coming down.

27:52.921 --> 27:53.820
Ho!

27:55.195 --> 27:58.734
Ah, the familiar sharp crack of tnt.

27:59.808 --> 28:03.330
But it didn't exactly pick the
truck up and move it in one piece.

28:03.331 --> 28:07.032
It flew for sure, but it flew apart first.

28:08.331 --> 28:09.155
Ha!

28:09.156 --> 28:10.081
Ha!

28:10.147 --> 28:12.031
Look at the size of it!

28:12.132 --> 28:13.768
That's a big hole.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.976
Do you see any piece of
the bulldozer anywhere?

28:16.977 --> 28:18.780
I don't see any.

28:19.871 --> 28:23.387
It doesn't take tracker
Savage long to find the trail.

28:24.520 --> 28:25.445
Ha!

28:25.746 --> 28:26.860
Found it!

28:29.748 --> 28:30.776
Dude!

28:32.004 --> 28:34.601
I think this is the only
chunk we're likely to find.

28:35.666 --> 28:38.539
Well, I'm sitting in all the
evidence we have of our tnt blast...

28:38.540 --> 28:43.126
one monster of a hole... and
one beat-up bulldozer bucket.

28:43.127 --> 28:46.047
We see pieces in the high-speed
shot flying every which way,

28:46.048 --> 28:48.792
and this is the only piece we this
is the only piece we recovered.

28:48.793 --> 28:50.088
And the force of this blast was enough

28:50.089 --> 28:53.937
to turn this quarter-inch
plate into a bubble.

28:55.231 --> 28:58.269
Now it's time to find out what
a slightly slower-speed explosive

28:58.270 --> 29:00.530
will do to one of these bulldozers.

29:01.460 --> 29:03.657
This stuff kind of
looks like laundry soap,

29:03.658 --> 29:04.786
but it's not. It's anfo,

29:04.787 --> 29:07.351
or ammonium nitrate and fuel oil.

29:07.388 --> 29:08.988
In the explosives world,

29:08.989 --> 29:11.106
it's what's known as a blasting agent.

29:11.107 --> 29:15.504
And it has a detonation velocity
of about 13,000 feet per second,

29:15.505 --> 29:17.552
or about half that of tnt.

29:17.553 --> 29:18.716
Fill her in.

29:19.648 --> 29:21.375
Why is that important to us?

29:21.497 --> 29:23.605
Well, instead of ripping and tearing

29:23.606 --> 29:26.204
like a really high explosive does,

29:26.205 --> 29:30.128
this stuff is known for more
pushing and moving of things.

29:31.062 --> 29:34.916
This bulldozer... it's
heavier than my wife.

29:34.917 --> 29:37.976
That's why they use it in
quarries and construction sites.

29:37.977 --> 29:40.978
So, we're hoping that if
we put that under our dozer,

29:40.979 --> 29:45.749
it'll just move it away in one
piece instead of blowing it to bits.

29:48.737 --> 29:49.798
Charged.

29:51.171 --> 29:54.670
Firing 4 pounds of
anfo in three, two, one!

29:56.146 --> 29:57.166
Whew!

29:59.020 --> 29:59.968
Ohh!

30:00.255 --> 30:02.754
Yeah, I saw it go all
the way up the hill there.

30:02.934 --> 30:03.851
Ho!

30:06.743 --> 30:08.074
We have a landing.

30:08.075 --> 30:12.120
That was quite an awesome thud.

30:13.403 --> 30:15.178
Yep, the distinctive-bass,

30:15.179 --> 30:17.871
earth-moving thud of anfo.

30:17.872 --> 30:22.398
But did it move the earth-moving
machinery in one piece?

30:22.595 --> 30:23.310
Wow!

30:23.311 --> 30:24.867
Look at that!

30:27.814 --> 30:29.273
It just sheared the welds.

30:29.274 --> 30:30.995
That's amazing!

30:31.685 --> 30:34.243
The main section became
separated from the bucket,

30:34.244 --> 30:35.812
but compared to the tnt,

30:35.813 --> 30:38.256
the damage was minimal.

30:38.876 --> 30:42.427
We came here today to figure
out what is our ideal explosive

30:42.428 --> 30:44.484
for getting us the result
that we see in the movie.

30:44.485 --> 30:47.507
What will move our
tractor high into the air

30:47.508 --> 30:51.398
without turning it into a lot of
little, broken, baby tractor bits?

30:51.399 --> 30:53.288
And here is all of our evidence.

30:53.289 --> 30:54.189
On my left,

30:54.190 --> 30:55.431
the tnt blast.

30:55.432 --> 30:58.318
This bucket is all that we found.

30:58.319 --> 30:59.867
It tore that thing to shreds.

30:59.868 --> 31:01.347
On my right,

31:01.348 --> 31:04.832
the slower-moving anfo
left us most of our evidence

31:04.833 --> 31:06.237
and threw it nice and high in the air.

31:06.238 --> 31:08.601
And honestly, for my money,
I think it's the anfo.

31:08.602 --> 31:11.852
I think this is most likely
to get us the distance

31:11.853 --> 31:15.550
we're looking for without the broken
tractor bits that we don't want.

31:15.551 --> 31:16.913
It's anfo.

31:16.914 --> 31:19.248
Next... purrs like a kitten.

31:19.249 --> 31:22.532
Will the half car go the full distance?

31:29.038 --> 31:30.564
So, even if we weren't
talking superheroes,

31:30.565 --> 31:31.656
this would still be busted.

31:31.657 --> 31:33.048
Because when the car is cut in half,

31:33.049 --> 31:34.674
it doesn't run for very long.

31:34.675 --> 31:38.031
Yeah, some might say that's 'cause
someone drove it directly into a wall.

31:38.032 --> 31:39.449
Details!

31:39.450 --> 31:41.528
All right. Well, I guess that's
one way of saying our test

31:41.529 --> 31:42.573
came to an abrupt ending,

31:42.574 --> 31:44.876
but I mean, let's face it... face
it... we put fuel in the lines,

31:44.877 --> 31:49.153
and I had to use starter fluid in the
carburetor to even get the car going.

31:49.154 --> 31:52.069
True, but the superhero in
me would like to remind you

31:52.070 --> 31:54.315
that Kato knew this car was
gonna be cut in half all along,

31:54.316 --> 31:56.499
so he put a reserve fuel
tank in the front of the car,

31:56.500 --> 31:57.715
so when our car was cut in half,

31:57.716 --> 31:59.995
no fuel lines were actually
cut in the first place.

31:59.996 --> 32:00.767
In which case,

32:00.768 --> 32:03.918
we need to modify our half car and
see if we can make it run for longer.

32:04.117 --> 32:05.104
Boom!

32:07.173 --> 32:10.891
Narrator: Okay, so, Seth is stretching
it, but it's a legitimate test.

32:10.892 --> 32:12.983
If the half car had the fuel,

32:12.984 --> 32:17.563
could it drive for long enough
to make a superhero-style getaway?

32:18.617 --> 32:19.274
To find out,

32:19.275 --> 32:21.961
the team hits the petaluma speedway.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.240
And with a couple of
laps under their belts,

32:25.241 --> 32:27.373
they're ready to prep their ride.

32:27.374 --> 32:30.879
Just as Seth suggested his
superhero sidekick, Kato, did,

32:30.880 --> 32:34.024
they're adding a reserve
fuel tank in the front.

32:34.025 --> 32:35.372
Without fuel,

32:35.677 --> 32:36.379
you don't go anywhere.

32:36.380 --> 32:37.903
But even with fuel,

32:37.904 --> 32:39.346
will they go anywhere?

32:39.347 --> 32:41.411
Will their half car be able to overcome

32:41.412 --> 32:44.779
the friction caused by the
drag of the undercarriage?

32:44.780 --> 32:49.436
And will the compromised structure
remain intact for any kind of distance?

32:49.437 --> 32:50.762
I think it'll make it three laps.

32:50.763 --> 32:52.897
Man, I would be happy if it made it one.

32:52.898 --> 32:54.189
Dude, I think five.

32:54.190 --> 32:55.103
Yeah? Let's go.

32:55.221 --> 32:56.598
All right. Let's try.

32:57.067 --> 32:58.592
Eat my dust.

32:59.101 --> 33:00.333
Purrs like a kitten.

33:00.334 --> 33:04.993
This is half-car drag race
in three, two, one. Go!

33:09.676 --> 33:11.212
Get it? "Drag race."

33:12.469 --> 33:13.684
Narrator: That's a promising start,

33:13.685 --> 33:15.133
and somewhat unexpected,

33:15.134 --> 33:16.806
because despite a safe,

33:16.807 --> 33:22.986
steady speed on the first lap...
he's maintaining about 20 right now.

33:24.270 --> 33:27.077
Tory is clearly having
no problems at all...

33:27.078 --> 33:29.542
not what the team thought
before they started.

33:29.543 --> 33:30.572
Picking up speed.

33:30.573 --> 33:31.949
He's up to 30.

33:31.950 --> 33:33.667
That's lap one!

33:35.627 --> 33:38.898
When Tory first started out, he
started out slow, 'cause, let's face it,

33:38.899 --> 33:43.049
this is the first time we've ever
driven a car that's cut in half,

33:43.050 --> 33:45.285
and so his laps were maybe 10,

33:45.286 --> 33:47.101
15 Miles an hour.

33:47.102 --> 33:49.682
But once he started getting
the hang of driving it,

33:49.717 --> 33:52.085
he punched it, and on the straightaways,

33:52.086 --> 33:54.829
he peeked out at over 40 Miles an hour.

33:54.830 --> 33:58.779
I cannot believe how fast
and how well this car drives.

33:58.780 --> 34:00.271
I mean, the handling is a little tricky.

34:00.272 --> 34:03.832
It's kind of like driving on a
wet road or maybe an icy road.

34:04.712 --> 34:06.922
Dude, that is crazy!

34:07.004 --> 34:08.170
That was lap 19.

34:08.172 --> 34:09.420
You're coming in for 20.

34:09.420 --> 34:11.257
I'm gonna be stopping you there.

34:11.259 --> 34:12.855
I cannot believe it!

34:12.856 --> 34:13.978
It worked!

34:13.980 --> 34:15.360
Cutting a car in half,

34:15.360 --> 34:16.835
driving it worked!

34:18.036 --> 34:21.527
Narrator: Against all the odds and
exceeding all three team members'

34:21.529 --> 34:24.844
expectations by a factor of at least 4,

34:24.844 --> 34:28.219
Tory completed 20 laps without a problem.

34:28.485 --> 34:30.340
Yeah!

34:30.583 --> 34:32.116
That was crazy!

34:32.117 --> 34:34.620
That's 20 laps at 40 Miles an hour,

34:34.621 --> 34:37.414
and the car was sparking
like it was catching on fire.

34:37.415 --> 34:38.967
Oh, that was great.

34:38.967 --> 34:40.504
No problems at all.

34:40.505 --> 34:42.536
Half-car altered... plausible.

34:42.536 --> 34:44.241
Totally plausible.

34:44.242 --> 34:46.722
If the black beauty
had a reserve fuel tank

34:46.723 --> 34:49.341
and if it had separate brake lines, yeah.

34:49.342 --> 34:50.056
Hey.

34:50.058 --> 34:51.742
Don't doubt Kato.

34:52.083 --> 34:52.734
Good job.

34:52.735 --> 34:54.596
That was awesome.

34:55.094 --> 34:55.760
Oh, my God.

34:55.761 --> 34:56.815
I could keep going.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.895
Narrator: So it's plausible.

34:58.896 --> 35:00.919
You can drive half a car.

35:00.920 --> 35:02.890
But what about the myth as a whole?

35:02.891 --> 35:05.361
For that wrap, it's back to the shop.

35:05.526 --> 35:08.121
Yeah, I think we've
done enough damage here.

35:10.923 --> 35:12.464
All right, so, how are
we gonna wrap this one up?

35:12.465 --> 35:14.088
I think we're gonna have
to call this one busted.

35:14.089 --> 35:15.242
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

35:15.243 --> 35:17.149
I think I saw a different
show than you guys.

35:17.150 --> 35:19.288
We were not able to cut a
car in half with an elevator.

35:19.289 --> 35:20.683
The car has a zipper thing in it.

35:20.684 --> 35:21.925
It cuts itself in half!

35:21.926 --> 35:23.427
All right, what about the fuel line?

35:23.428 --> 35:25.474
He put it all in the front. He knew!

35:25.475 --> 35:27.517
Okay, okay... in the
perfect superhero world,

35:27.518 --> 35:29.059
if the black beauty happened
to be a front-wheel-drive,

35:29.060 --> 35:29.989
unlike anything of the era,

35:29.990 --> 35:33.671
and the gas tank were in the front
and the brakes were in the front

35:33.861 --> 35:36.082
sure, it's totally plausible.

35:36.083 --> 35:36.706
Plausible?

35:36.707 --> 35:37.526
♪♪♪

35:38.011 --> 35:38.858
♪♪♪

35:38.971 --> 35:39.814
nope.

35:39.826 --> 35:40.554
So it's confirmed.

35:40.555 --> 35:41.301
Don't press your luck. No.

35:41.302 --> 35:43.393
Okay. I'll take plausible.

35:45.750 --> 35:47.549
Narrator: Up next...
someone order some anfo?

35:47.550 --> 35:51.945
Adam and Jamie attempt to move the
earth-moving machinery with some precise,

35:51.946 --> 35:53.918
explosive engineering.

36:01.495 --> 36:04.678
Having determined that the
explosive escape myth is busted...

36:04.679 --> 36:06.886
it was completely horrifying.

36:07.079 --> 36:11.324
Adam and Jamie want to know what it
would take to re-create the scene.

36:13.555 --> 36:15.519
The bulldozer has to get airborne,

36:15.520 --> 36:17.692
remain intact for the flight,

36:17.693 --> 36:21.513
and land at some distance
away from its starting point.

36:22.823 --> 36:23.680
Let's do it.

36:23.792 --> 36:27.623
Having determined that anfo is
our lifting explosive of choice,

36:27.624 --> 36:30.319
we've come back to try it full-scale.

36:30.320 --> 36:33.308
That's right
- we're gonna put 250 pounds of the stuff

36:33.309 --> 36:35.032
underneath our full-sized dozer,

36:35.033 --> 36:39.438
and we're gonna see if we can get it
to fly just like we saw in the movie.

36:41.540 --> 36:43.094
I'd say that's perfect!

36:43.095 --> 36:44.187
That's the hole.

36:44.188 --> 36:46.958
Now for a whole lot of big boom.

36:47.999 --> 36:49.210
Someone order some anfo?

36:49.211 --> 36:52.986
With the anfo laid into the trench
in a carefully thought-out volume

36:52.987 --> 36:54.463
and configuration,

36:54.464 --> 36:58.384
the crew rig the detonation cord
that will initiate the explosion,

36:58.385 --> 37:01.138
and that means everything's ready to blow,

37:01.139 --> 37:05.555
so Adam and Jamie bring in the big
shovel to first fill in the hole...

37:05.591 --> 37:07.142
that's what I'm talking about.

37:07.143 --> 37:09.611
And then maneuver the dozer into place.

37:09.612 --> 37:11.939
We've taken our 250 pounds of anfo

37:11.940 --> 37:16.386
and lined it up right down the
length of our machine just off center.

37:16.387 --> 37:17.370
Why off center?

37:17.371 --> 37:21.075
Well, we hope that by putting
it a little bit on this side,

37:21.076 --> 37:22.402
just a few inches,

37:22.403 --> 37:23.440
that when it goes off,

37:23.441 --> 37:27.967
it'll push the machine up and over
that way and do our job for us.

37:27.968 --> 37:29.277
Okay, stop!

37:29.768 --> 37:31.135
Ha, that's perfect.

37:31.136 --> 37:31.904
Yep.

37:31.905 --> 37:32.414
Let's blow it up.

37:32.415 --> 37:33.368
Okay.

37:34.012 --> 37:38.112
Now, we've chosen to put 250
pounds of anfo under this tractor,

37:38.113 --> 37:40.404
and we've chosen that
number very carefully.

37:40.405 --> 37:43.037
We know how to blow up trucks.

37:43.038 --> 37:46.847
We've done it here...... and here.

37:48.171 --> 37:49.173
But in this case,

37:49.174 --> 37:52.882
we want to actually lift this
truck without destroying it,

37:52.883 --> 37:56.980
and we have settled on 250 pounds
as the most likely candidate

37:56.981 --> 37:59.492
for moving without destroying.

37:59.606 --> 38:00.804
Narrator: But it's a gamble,

38:00.805 --> 38:04.439
as they've only got one
bulldozer and one shot at it.

38:04.440 --> 38:04.975
Are we ready?

38:04.976 --> 38:05.588
We are ready.

38:05.589 --> 38:06.438
Let's do it!

38:06.439 --> 38:07.168
Are you ready?

38:07.169 --> 38:08.380
I sure am.

38:08.381 --> 38:14.586
250 pounds of anfo in... three, two, one!

38:16.487 --> 38:18.034
Whoa!

38:19.007 --> 38:21.145
I see pieces of tires.

38:23.656 --> 38:25.229
I think it was lifted.

38:25.230 --> 38:28.285
I think it was lifted in
a lot of little pieces.

38:29.561 --> 38:31.614
Like a nuclear cloud.

38:32.442 --> 38:33.490
Yeah.

38:33.491 --> 38:37.663
Well... that was a little
more than we wanted, wasn't it?

38:38.256 --> 38:41.381
well, they got liftoff...

38:41.382 --> 38:44.044
several times...

38:44.045 --> 38:46.421
in several different directions.

38:48.297 --> 38:49.034
And, yes,

38:49.035 --> 38:52.915
perhaps they did use a
fraction too much anfo,

38:52.916 --> 38:55.319
but Adam doesn't seem too upset.

38:55.320 --> 38:55.809
Behind me,

38:55.810 --> 39:00.126
a dust cloud that used to be the
site on which our bulldozer sat.

39:01.232 --> 39:02.702
We can't see exactly what happened,

39:02.703 --> 39:04.495
but given the pieces of bulldozer

39:04.496 --> 39:08.232
and tires I saw flying
from the main location...

39:09.041 --> 39:10.871
I think we destroyed a bulldozer.

39:11.540 --> 39:13.617
I'm not that broken up about it, either.

39:14.204 --> 39:15.595
Narrator: Adam may not be broken up,

39:15.596 --> 39:19.730
but anything at the center
of this probably will be.

39:20.392 --> 39:21.896
Look at the shock wave!

39:21.928 --> 39:22.622
Wow.

39:22.623 --> 39:24.640
Ah, I love that.

39:24.775 --> 39:27.464
Perfect sphere of destruction!

39:33.349 --> 39:34.299
Wow!

39:34.300 --> 39:35.198
There's no dozer,

39:35.199 --> 39:37.965
but there's no place where
the dozer sat, either.

39:37.966 --> 39:42.317
This hole is deeper than
the hole we dug for the car.

39:43.516 --> 39:45.214
You think we went a little too far?

39:45.215 --> 39:46.483
Just a little.

39:48.945 --> 39:50.221
Well, pigs may not fly,

39:50.222 --> 39:54.514
but bulldozers apparently
can... at least in little pieces.

39:55.129 --> 39:56.771
Oh, look. There's the wheel.

39:58.283 --> 40:01.009
Narrator: And those pieces
clocked some frequent-flyer Miles.

40:01.010 --> 40:05.038
This is about 500 feet
from the blast center.

40:05.329 --> 40:06.285
Wow.

40:08.612 --> 40:10.034
That's awesome.

40:11.443 --> 40:13.170
The most damning aspect of this

40:13.171 --> 40:15.833
is I'm sitting on the
biggest part of the bulldozer

40:15.834 --> 40:16.695
that we can find,

40:16.696 --> 40:18.830
and it's sitting about
as far from the hole

40:18.831 --> 40:20.655
as we saw the bulldozer fly in the movie,

40:20.656 --> 40:26.516
except the hole is a hole the size
of the car that would be there.

40:26.586 --> 40:29.671
The entirety of the thing
would have been vaporized along

40:29.672 --> 40:31.691
with the two heroes in the car.

40:31.737 --> 40:33.338
It's really quite spectacular.

40:33.339 --> 40:35.311
And I hope this goes
to show you kids at home

40:35.312 --> 40:39.228
that bulldozers and
explosives just don't mix.

40:39.229 --> 40:44.034
Well, let me see if I can
reconstruct the scene here.

40:44.706 --> 40:45.954
You got your throttle,

40:45.955 --> 40:47.982
and you got your seat.

40:54.708 --> 40:56.592
Even with the slower detonation velocity

40:56.593 --> 40:59.237
and the higher pushing power of the anfo,

40:59.290 --> 41:02.160
we weren't quite able to get that
sweet spot we were looking for

41:02.161 --> 41:04.224
where everything is perfectly balanced

41:04.225 --> 41:08.987
and the machine comes up off the hole
and sets down nicely someplace else.

41:08.988 --> 41:09.609
The thing is,

41:09.610 --> 41:11.299
for that to happen,

41:11.401 --> 41:14.738
all sorts of things have
to be balanced just so...

41:14.739 --> 41:18.520
the exact configuration and
quantity of the explosives...

41:18.521 --> 41:22.112
the exact amount of earth
on top of the explosives...

41:22.334 --> 41:25.910
the weight and the configuration
of the machine overhead.

41:26.206 --> 41:28.537
All of that stuff has to come into

41:28.538 --> 41:32.453
just one moment of interacting
perfectly for this to happen.

41:32.521 --> 41:34.046
We didn't quite get it.

41:34.360 --> 41:35.518
So, where do we stand on this one?

41:35.519 --> 41:39.178
Well, given an infinite quantity
of bulldozers and explosives,

41:39.179 --> 41:43.263
we might be able to figure out how
to move one without destroying it.

41:43.311 --> 41:45.716
Yeah, but there's no permutation
of any amount of explosives

41:45.717 --> 41:47.645
that could move even
the dozer a little bit

41:47.646 --> 41:50.469
that wouldn't leave the guys
in the car vaporized jelly.

41:50.470 --> 41:51.509
This thing's totally busted.

41:51.510 --> 41:53.130
Yeah, it's busted.

41:53.164 --> 41:54.797
You think Seth is gonna be mad?

41:54.798 --> 41:56.107
He'll get over it.

41:56.108 --> 42:00.169
