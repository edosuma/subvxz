Man: Need to get the Santa out of here.

01:44.702 --> 01:45.831
Man #2:
Why come?

01:45.833 --> 01:47.364
Number one, it's spring.
It's not winter.

01:47.366 --> 01:49.300
- Spring.
- So?

01:49.302 --> 01:51.432
Secondly,

01:51.434 --> 01:53.698
you don't even work here.

01:53.700 --> 01:56.234
When are you gonna stop
putting all your shit all around

01:56.236 --> 01:58.000
all over the place?

01:58.002 --> 02:00.232
- Third...
- Mm-hmm.

02:00.234 --> 02:02.234
...Santa Claus ain't even
of African descent.

02:02.236 --> 02:04.200
Oh, yeah, that's it there.

02:04.202 --> 02:06.100
I was waiting for that.

02:06.102 --> 02:09.334
You do realize Santa Claus
ain't even a real person.

02:09.336 --> 02:12.933
You can make him
whatever color you want to.

02:12.935 --> 02:15.433
No. Charlie Brown ain't real.

02:16.368 --> 02:17.969
Charlie Brown real?

02:17.971 --> 02:20.036
Well, hell, no.

02:20.038 --> 02:21.869
Well, you ain't gonna draw a picture

02:21.871 --> 02:24.971
of a little black kid,
round head,

02:24.973 --> 02:28.099
curly-squiggly hair

02:28.101 --> 02:30.601
and call him a "Peanuts" comic.

02:30.603 --> 02:32.334
Well, you could if you wanted to.

02:32.336 --> 02:34.235
Well, you could physically,
but you can't.

02:34.237 --> 02:35.937
Yes, you could.

02:35.939 --> 02:38.004
(Sighs)

02:38.006 --> 02:40.835
All right, fine.
You could.

02:40.837 --> 02:42.602
But you gotta get rid of the damn Santa.

02:42.604 --> 02:44.336
And I got news for you, too.

02:44.338 --> 02:47.336
If some black man came down my
chimney wearing a red jogging suit,

02:47.338 --> 02:48.871
I'd blow a hole right through his red hat.

02:48.873 --> 02:50.571
- (Bangs)
- How's that...

02:50.573 --> 02:52.635
(doorbell chimes)

02:55.805 --> 02:57.039
What?

02:59.140 --> 03:01.406
Oh, no, no.
No, no, man.

03:01.408 --> 03:04.105
I just need a loan on my shotgun.

03:05.273 --> 03:07.406
Well... honest.

03:08.407 --> 03:11.073
(Stuttering)
What... what's wrong with you kids?

03:11.075 --> 03:14.539
Coming into a man place of business
pointing a shotgun at people.

03:15.640 --> 03:17.775
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to cause no fuss.

03:18.876 --> 03:22.473
You know the pawn shop business
is a dangerous game.

03:22.475 --> 03:23.740
Man: Damn right.

03:23.742 --> 03:26.008
My brother, he move out West,
opened a pawn shop.

03:26.010 --> 03:28.207
- Found him in the basement, dead.
- I remember that.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.676
Oh, yeah?
What happened to him?

03:29.678 --> 03:32.009
I'd rather not talk about it.

03:32.011 --> 03:33.472
You're lucky...

03:35.006 --> 03:36.574
I didn't blow a hole through your head.

03:38.375 --> 03:40.975
Well, how was you gonna do that
with your hands up in the air?

03:43.711 --> 03:45.277
Shut up.

03:46.642 --> 03:48.709
Give me the gun.

03:54.176 --> 03:56.710
Well, I'll give you 20.

03:56.712 --> 03:58.745
Oh, come on, now.
Come on.

04:00.711 --> 04:02.144
50.

04:03.945 --> 04:05.110
No.

04:06.244 --> 04:08.476
- 40.
- No.

04:09.879 --> 04:12.643
- 30?
- Nope.

04:12.645 --> 04:14.376
25.

04:16.245 --> 04:19.446
- No.
- Come on, man. Shit.

04:20.947 --> 04:23.013
Well, all right.

04:35.048 --> 04:37.616
(Birds chirping)

04:55.014 --> 04:57.080
(cell phone ringing)

05:00.249 --> 05:01.615
Hey.

05:03.382 --> 05:05.883
(Sniffs) Whoo!

05:05.885 --> 05:07.948
Hey, man, is Vern there yet?

05:08.950 --> 05:10.282
No, he late.

05:10.284 --> 05:13.216
Hey, where you at, man?

05:13.218 --> 05:14.549
Don't worry,
I'll be there in a minute.

05:14.551 --> 05:16.250
You just keep his ass there, huh?

05:16.252 --> 05:21.184
'Cause I've been up for three
days since we smoked that shit

05:21.186 --> 05:23.419
and I'm beginning to hallucinate, man.

05:23.421 --> 05:26.217
(Sniffs)
Ah! God!

05:26.219 --> 05:28.352
On my way here,

05:28.354 --> 05:31.619
when I was driving in,
I saw the King, man.

05:31.621 --> 05:34.617
I swear I saw Elvis
walking through town square.

05:35.719 --> 05:40.520
I can't be robbing no people when
I'm fucked up like this, man.

05:42.121 --> 05:43.255
Hey.

05:44.423 --> 05:46.785
Quit being a pussy.
I'll be there in a minute, all right?

05:48.953 --> 05:51.952
You just keep Vernon there
'cause I'm gonna fuck his ass up.

05:57.255 --> 05:58.956
Shit!

06:15.654 --> 06:19.122
Jesus Christ, man.
Thank God, man.

06:19.124 --> 06:20.422
Where the hell have you been?

06:20.424 --> 06:22.922
Oh, I had to pawn my shotgun
to get gas money.

06:22.924 --> 06:26.454
Man, how the hell we gonna
rob Stanley without a shotgun?

06:26.456 --> 06:29.089
- Well, how was I supposed to get here?
- You stupid fuck!

06:29.091 --> 06:31.623
How was I supposed
to get here without gas?

06:31.625 --> 06:34.290
I would've come
and picked you up, dumbass.

06:34.292 --> 06:37.957
Listen, don't you think this whole
robbing Stanley thing is stupid anyway?

06:37.959 --> 06:40.456
And why the fuck we gotta meet
out in this field?

06:40.458 --> 06:42.623
You are so fucking stupid, man.

06:42.625 --> 06:44.959
'Cause it's top secret shit,
that's why!

06:49.460 --> 06:52.526
So fields is the place
for top secret meetings, huh?

06:54.489 --> 06:57.257
Why are you so damn worried
about the gun anyhow?

06:57.259 --> 06:59.090
There's three of us and only one of him.

06:59.092 --> 07:00.758
We just go in there,
we beat him down,

07:00.760 --> 07:02.292
we take the meth,
we get out of there.

07:02.294 --> 07:04.360
- It's easy.
- You're so stupid, man.

07:04.362 --> 07:07.558
- What?
- The guy is a fucking geeked-out,

07:07.560 --> 07:11.626
hillbilly, drug-cooking,
dumb shit.

07:11.628 --> 07:14.191
You don't think he has
a fucking arsenal of weapons

07:14.193 --> 07:15.959
laying around his fucking house?

07:15.961 --> 07:18.627
You don't think he ain't got his head
out the window every five minutes

07:18.629 --> 07:20.760
peeking 'round to see
what the fuck's going on?

07:20.762 --> 07:23.661
You know this shit
fucking makes you paranoid, man.

07:26.228 --> 07:28.528
Speaking of dope, man,
you got any on you?

07:28.530 --> 07:29.962
Hell, no.

07:29.964 --> 07:33.363
That dickhead at the pawn shop
only gave me 20 on the gun.

07:33.365 --> 07:35.262
So I only got enough for gas...

07:37.997 --> 07:40.030
What the fuck, man?!

07:40.032 --> 07:42.097
Raw Dog: Shit!

07:43.599 --> 07:45.598
(Groaning)

07:51.831 --> 07:53.531
What the fuck, man?

07:53.533 --> 07:55.898
That son of a bitch stole $80
out of my sock drawer.

07:55.900 --> 07:58.199
- No, he didn't.
- Bullshit!

07:58.201 --> 08:00.133
Randy, he didn't fucking take shit.

08:00.135 --> 08:02.829
- Vern didn't steal anything, man.
- How the fuck do you know?

08:02.831 --> 08:05.797
Because he just pawned
the goddamn shotgun

08:05.799 --> 08:08.865
so he could put some fucking gas
in his car, man.

08:08.867 --> 08:10.633
And he didn't have no meth, either.

08:10.635 --> 08:13.033
So clearly,
he ain't got no extra cash.

08:13.965 --> 08:15.631
Huh.

08:15.633 --> 08:17.197
Well, shit.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.399
Wait,

08:20.401 --> 08:21.966
he pawned the shotgun?

08:21.968 --> 08:23.767
How the fuck are we supposed
to rob Stanley?

08:24.902 --> 08:27.032
I don't know, Randy.

08:27.034 --> 08:29.799
Fuck, man, why you gotta go
and run Vernon over?

08:29.801 --> 08:31.233
(Gurgling)

08:31.235 --> 08:33.366
I mean, shit, what makes you
think he stole it in the first place?

08:33.369 --> 08:35.267
Lamar told me he took it.

08:35.269 --> 08:36.765
- Oh, Lamar did.
- Mm-hmm.

08:36.768 --> 08:38.100
You mean the crackhead?

08:38.102 --> 08:40.267
You mean that lying,
fucking cheating thief?

08:40.269 --> 08:41.366
That Lamar?

08:41.368 --> 08:43.702
You stupid fuck!
He gets his hair cut at Cook's!

08:43.703 --> 08:46.703
- He said he seen Vernon take it.
- That don't mean shit, man!

08:46.705 --> 08:49.268
I mean, Jesus Christ!
You fucking...

08:49.270 --> 08:52.702
you ran fucking Vernon's ass over, man.

08:52.704 --> 08:55.167
You could've fucking asked him first.

08:55.169 --> 08:56.968
- (Flies buzzing)
- What the fuck?

08:56.970 --> 08:58.803
Instead you trust some dude's word

08:58.805 --> 09:01.037
with the name of fucking "stinky nuts."

09:01.039 --> 09:02.804
Made sense at the time, all
right?

09:06.439 --> 09:08.468
Man, we gotta do something.

09:09.569 --> 09:11.669
We gotta take him
to a hospital or something.

09:11.671 --> 09:13.969
This gurgling shit,
this ain't normal, man.

09:13.971 --> 09:15.436
I ain't taking his ass nowhere
and getting locked up.

09:15.438 --> 09:19.671
- Well, we can't just leave him here.
- Move.

09:19.673 --> 09:21.270
(Groans)

09:21.272 --> 09:22.904
See? He's fine.

09:22.906 --> 09:24.571
Let's go get my money from Lamar.

09:24.573 --> 09:26.904
Good afternoon.
I'm Connie Swanson.

09:26.906 --> 09:30.071
And I'm here with a man
who helps save lives by day

09:30.073 --> 09:33.139
and is the King by night.

09:34.105 --> 09:36.705
- Hi.
- Meet Ricky Baldoski.

09:36.707 --> 09:40.038
He's a volunteer emergency
medical service technician by day

09:40.040 --> 09:42.440
and, as you can probably guess,

09:42.442 --> 09:45.641
does Elvis tribute shows by night.

09:45.643 --> 09:48.607
- That's right. I'm Ricky Baldoski.
- Yes.

09:48.609 --> 09:51.608
Tell us who some of your
big influences are, Ricky.

09:51.610 --> 09:52.641
Well, definitely.

09:52.643 --> 09:55.041
The King, um, King,
and the King.

09:55.043 --> 09:57.208
- KKK all the way.
- You can catch Ricky...

09:57.210 --> 09:58.442
- Wait, no...
- ...this weekend

09:58.444 --> 10:01.940
performing his tribute
performance to the King.

10:01.942 --> 10:04.908
I'd like to just say one word:
God bless America!

10:04.910 --> 10:06.543
...Irwin County Fair.

10:06.545 --> 10:07.943
- (Car doors close)
- Back to you, Michael.

10:07.945 --> 10:09.543
Randy: Lamar!

10:10.677 --> 10:12.044
You lying bastard.

10:12.046 --> 10:14.607
Vern didn't steal my money,
you did.

10:14.609 --> 10:16.473
No, I didn't.

10:16.475 --> 10:17.841
Bullshit.

10:17.843 --> 10:19.774
I know it was you 'cause it
sure as hell wasn't Vernon

10:19.776 --> 10:21.375
and you're the one who lied.

10:21.377 --> 10:23.544
Oh.
Oh, man.

10:23.546 --> 10:25.078
I guess it was me, man.

10:25.080 --> 10:26.111
What the...

10:26.113 --> 10:27.942
I fucking knew it.

10:27.944 --> 10:30.209
You give me my money,
you lying piece of shit.

10:30.211 --> 10:32.610
- I don't have it.
- What?

10:32.612 --> 10:33.943
Where is it? Where is it?

10:33.945 --> 10:36.143
It's in the air, man.
I smoked it up.

10:36.145 --> 10:39.678
$80 since this morning?
What the fuck?!

10:41.445 --> 10:43.844
We gonna kick your ass, Lamar.

10:43.846 --> 10:45.813
We gonna fuck you up good.

10:45.815 --> 10:49.144
'Cause of you,
old Vern got killed.

10:49.146 --> 10:51.479
And that shit ain't cool, man.

10:51.481 --> 10:52.779
There's getting high

10:52.781 --> 10:55.111
and there's getting a brother
fucking ran over!

10:55.113 --> 10:58.046
God damn it, bro!
Kick his ass!

10:58.048 --> 11:00.846
I oughta kick your fucking ass, Lamar.

11:00.848 --> 11:02.614
Randy, don't, man.

11:02.616 --> 11:03.914
You got a gun, huh?

11:03.916 --> 11:05.047
- Huh?
- No.

11:05.049 --> 11:07.912
- We need a gun.
- Hey, hey, we could ask Don.

11:07.914 --> 11:09.679
Don will have a gun.

11:10.814 --> 11:11.981
Yeah.

11:11.983 --> 11:15.681
We gonna go get the gun and we
gonna come back and shoot you.

11:15.683 --> 11:19.083
- Right?
- Don't you steal shit while I'm gone.

11:19.085 --> 11:20.482
Okay?

11:20.484 --> 11:21.878
Okay.

11:26.514 --> 11:28.714
Is that my Styx CD in your pants?

11:29.916 --> 11:32.416
- Huh?
- God damn it. Yeah.

11:33.417 --> 11:34.581
Fuck, Lamar!

11:34.583 --> 11:36.780
Put it back, Lamar.

11:36.782 --> 11:38.815
- I ain't fucking around.
- Sorry, man, it was right here.

11:38.817 --> 11:40.514
I was warming it.

11:40.516 --> 11:42.482
It's your fucking ass now.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.216
You're fucking dead, Lamar.

11:44.218 --> 11:47.518
- Kick his fucking ass, Randy.
- (Exhales)

11:47.520 --> 11:48.749
What the fuck?

11:48.751 --> 11:50.149
What, you ain't gonna kick
his fucking ass?

11:50.151 --> 11:51.650
Randy: Shut the fuck up.

11:51.652 --> 11:54.351
We gonna come back
and kick your fucking ass!

11:55.285 --> 11:57.085
Oh, shit!
Fuck, man!

11:57.087 --> 11:59.986
- (Yelling)
- You guys are fuckin' mean, man.

11:59.988 --> 12:01.916
(Engine revs)

12:02.919 --> 12:04.953
Yeah, so we just wanna borrow
your gun for a couple of hours

12:04.955 --> 12:06.620
and we'll bring it right back.

12:08.021 --> 12:09.786
Get the fuck outta here.

12:13.154 --> 12:14.884
What the fuck, man?

12:19.020 --> 12:21.754
(Tires screeching)

12:23.556 --> 12:27.522
I can't believe that fuck-mouth
slammed the door in my face.

12:27.524 --> 12:30.219
I should've kicked his ass.
That's what I should've fucking done.

12:30.221 --> 12:32.153
- Yep.
- Dumb motherfucker.

12:32.155 --> 12:33.220
Hey...

12:34.722 --> 12:37.387
didn't we borrow his lawn mower one time

12:37.389 --> 12:39.989
and then we sold it

12:39.991 --> 12:42.921
instead of taking it back to him?

12:42.923 --> 12:45.022
I want that machine back tomorrow,
you understand?

12:45.024 --> 12:47.055
Yeah, yeah, you got it.
You got it.

12:47.057 --> 12:48.355
Thanks, Mr. Don.

13:14.292 --> 13:16.025
Huh.

13:17.059 --> 13:18.359
Oh.

13:18.361 --> 13:21.657
- No wonder he's so fucking pissed.
- Yeah.

13:24.093 --> 13:26.359
Hey, man,
I've gotta ask you something.

13:27.860 --> 13:29.860
Yeah?
What is it?

13:30.861 --> 13:32.561
Look, don't be giving me no bullshit about

13:32.563 --> 13:35.424
how you can't believe I don't
know and stuff, though, okay?

13:35.426 --> 13:36.657
Fine. What is it?

13:36.659 --> 13:38.992
I'm serious, man.
You can't be calling me dumbass.

13:41.193 --> 13:43.192
For fuck's sakes, all right.

13:43.194 --> 13:45.161
Okay, we've been
in the Aryan Confederacy now

13:45.163 --> 13:46.195
for about a year, right?

13:46.197 --> 13:47.762
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Okay.

13:47.764 --> 13:51.493
There's one thing I don't understand.

13:51.495 --> 13:54.060
Would you just spit it out, Raw
Dog?

13:54.062 --> 13:55.360
Man, you're freaking me out.

13:55.362 --> 13:57.060
- Fuck.
- Okay. Okay.

13:58.396 --> 14:00.762
I understand

14:00.764 --> 14:03.227
why we're supposed to hate niggers, okay.

14:03.229 --> 14:05.396
- Yeah.
- They look different,

14:05.398 --> 14:07.296
they walk different,
they talk different.

14:07.298 --> 14:09.029
I get it, okay.

14:10.397 --> 14:12.397
But Jews, man,

14:12.399 --> 14:14.497
why are supposed to hate the Jews?

14:17.397 --> 14:20.298
I just found out Jerry Springer was a Jew.

14:21.299 --> 14:23.431
Jerry fucking Springer, man.

14:23.433 --> 14:25.531
If I seen him in the street,

14:25.533 --> 14:27.632
I would kiss his ass

14:27.634 --> 14:29.263
and ask him for an autograph.

14:31.131 --> 14:34.233
I got three Adam Sandler DVDs at home

14:34.235 --> 14:36.299
and I just found out he's a Jew, too.

14:39.468 --> 14:42.730
If I was in a building
and 10 Jews sit down next to me,

14:42.732 --> 14:44.964
I wouldn't even know it.

14:44.966 --> 14:46.766
So what's the difference?

14:46.768 --> 14:48.898
They got money?
Well, money ain't so bad.

14:48.900 --> 14:50.833
Shit, I wish I had some money.

14:51.767 --> 14:53.568
They got big noses.

14:53.570 --> 14:55.699
At least they're supposed to.

14:55.701 --> 14:57.399
Damn Teddy's got a nose that's bigger

14:57.401 --> 14:59.566
than this whole damn truck
and he ain't Jewish.

14:59.568 --> 15:01.733
So, what, are we supposed
to hate him?

15:03.133 --> 15:05.468
For crying out loud.

15:06.435 --> 15:09.034
Jesus is a Jew, man.

15:09.036 --> 15:10.768
I mean, we're talking Jesus.

15:10.770 --> 15:12.901
We go to church every Sunday

15:12.903 --> 15:16.834
and we pray to the King of the Jews, man.

15:18.068 --> 15:19.602
Well?

15:19.604 --> 15:21.969
(Tires screech)

15:26.004 --> 15:27.937
Now you listen

15:27.939 --> 15:30.104
and you listen good.

15:30.106 --> 15:32.204
If you repeat this,
so help me God,

15:32.206 --> 15:34.437
I will run your ass over, too.

15:36.402 --> 15:38.402
(Engine revs)

15:44.271 --> 15:46.773
I don't know, either, man,
all right?

15:46.775 --> 15:48.839
I don't know, either.

15:51.303 --> 15:53.304
I mean, hell,
I don't even hate black people.

15:55.105 --> 15:57.472
Tyrone and Bert
are some of my best buddies.

15:57.474 --> 16:00.172
- You know them, right?
- Yeah, man. They're cool, too.

16:00.174 --> 16:02.437
Yeah.

16:02.439 --> 16:06.405
I mean, do you know
how awkward it is

16:06.407 --> 16:07.972
when I got to leave the card game early

16:07.974 --> 16:10.172
to go to my white supremacist meeting?

16:10.174 --> 16:11.804
I mean, they seem
to understand,

16:11.806 --> 16:13.940
but, hell, it's just...

16:15.940 --> 16:18.139
The only reason I started going
in the first place

16:18.141 --> 16:21.207
is 'cause Greg's wife puts
out that little buffet table

16:21.209 --> 16:23.273
with them meatballs
and them little smoky wieners.

16:23.275 --> 16:26.476
- Yeah, them are good, too.
- Hell, yeah, they're good. Fuck.

16:26.478 --> 16:29.340
Next thing I know,
I'm going to every meeting,

16:29.342 --> 16:30.775
you know.

16:30.777 --> 16:33.542
Full-blown member.
Got the tats and everything.

16:41.077 --> 16:43.341
So we're pretty much
on the same page, then.

16:46.177 --> 16:48.177
Sounds like it.

16:48.179 --> 16:50.944
We ain't even really white
supremacists at all, are we?

16:55.080 --> 16:57.142
Guess not.

16:58.076 --> 17:00.809
Should we still be going
to them meetings, Randy?

17:06.214 --> 17:08.413
Them little smoky wieners sure are good.

17:09.412 --> 17:11.344
- Yeah, they're pretty good, all right.
- Yeah.

17:11.346 --> 17:13.944
- (Laughing)
- They are good.

17:13.945 --> 17:15.211
- (Tires screech)
- Oh, shit!

17:15.213 --> 17:18.544
(Both yelling)

17:32.014 --> 17:33.981
What the fuck?!

17:37.013 --> 17:39.179
- Oh!
- Shit!

17:39.181 --> 17:42.248
(Both screaming)

17:57.118 --> 17:58.950
Hey.

17:58.952 --> 18:00.584
Huh?

18:03.948 --> 18:06.381
What is that?
A bow?

18:06.383 --> 18:09.815
Yeah, it's a bow.
Let's get it.

18:10.784 --> 18:12.716
What are we gonna get that for?

18:13.985 --> 18:16.018
We gonna rob Stanley with it.

18:25.384 --> 18:27.218
(Laughs)

18:38.486 --> 18:40.553
(man groaning)

18:53.889 --> 18:55.622
(laughs)

18:55.624 --> 18:57.286
Randy: He's taking a...

19:01.088 --> 19:03.188
- Hey!
- Hey.

19:03.190 --> 19:05.589
Oh, shit!
Come on, let's go.

19:06.557 --> 19:08.158
Come on, Raw Dog.

19:09.821 --> 19:11.186
Come on, man.

19:12.254 --> 19:14.121
Hey!

19:14.123 --> 19:16.955
Take a guy's bow like that?

19:16.957 --> 19:18.689
Fucking prick.

19:23.156 --> 19:25.055
Hey, see you later there,
cheese dick.

19:25.057 --> 19:26.589
(Whooping)

19:26.591 --> 19:29.256
Yeah, Raw Dog!
Yahoo!

19:42.292 --> 19:44.057
Shit.

19:44.059 --> 19:45.991
That motherfucker.

19:52.559 --> 19:54.159
(Engine turns off)

20:14.697 --> 20:16.759
(bird screeches)

20:21.161 --> 20:22.726
You okay?

20:26.294 --> 20:28.029
I don't think so.

20:37.496 --> 20:39.094
(Zippo closes)

20:40.563 --> 20:42.630
What happened to you?

20:42.632 --> 20:45.762
- (Flies buzzing)
- This bastard ran me over.

20:49.531 --> 20:51.897
Run over and left for dead, huh?

20:53.499 --> 20:55.132
Yeah.

20:55.134 --> 20:56.930
Take you to a hospital?

20:57.998 --> 21:00.064
I don't wanna go to the hospital.

21:00.066 --> 21:03.465
I wanna find those
backstabbing cocksuckers.

21:04.400 --> 21:05.866
Revenge, huh?

21:06.967 --> 21:09.334
That's a dangerous word.

21:10.599 --> 21:12.498
It's appropriate, though, I
guess.

21:15.634 --> 21:17.601
You don't look familiar.

21:19.869 --> 21:21.568
You from around here?

21:23.665 --> 21:25.665
Just passing through.

21:27.933 --> 21:29.867
You sure I can't take you to a hospital?

21:31.068 --> 21:33.135
No.

21:33.137 --> 21:35.835
I know where them fuckers is gonna be.

21:35.837 --> 21:38.134
I plan on meeting them there.

21:39.502 --> 21:42.634
Only problem is I pawned my shotgun.

21:42.636 --> 21:44.567
I see.

21:52.403 --> 21:54.303
Give me a second.

22:18.038 --> 22:20.370
Now...

22:20.372 --> 22:22.271
I can't take you there...

22:23.606 --> 22:25.705
but I can offer you this.

22:27.641 --> 22:31.404
- You'd give me your gun?
- I ain't giving you my gun.

22:32.738 --> 22:36.371
I'm offering you salvation.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.907
(Car door opens, closes)

22:55.143 --> 22:56.709
(engine revs)

23:05.842 --> 23:07.909
(distant chatter and music playing)

23:12.710 --> 23:15.277
What the fuck happened
to you back there, huh?

23:15.279 --> 23:17.011
Froze up like a retard.

23:17.013 --> 23:19.245
I can't have you doing that shit in there.

23:21.179 --> 23:22.943
I seen something.

23:25.910 --> 23:28.110
What?

23:28.112 --> 23:30.145
I'd rather not say.

23:32.580 --> 23:35.013
Remember when
we was talking on the phone,

23:35.015 --> 23:36.213
I told you I'd been up for three days

23:36.215 --> 23:37.677
and I started seeing some weird shit?

23:37.679 --> 23:39.743
Just tell me what you seen.

23:46.079 --> 23:48.346
An army of naked zombie women.

23:50.748 --> 23:53.845
An army of naked zombie women?

23:54.814 --> 23:58.679
Dear God,
are you fucking losing it?

23:58.681 --> 24:00.146
First Elvis, now this?

24:00.148 --> 24:02.647
What the... man,
pull your shit together, man.

24:02.650 --> 24:04.248
- We got a job to do.
- I know, man.

24:04.250 --> 24:06.513
That's what I'm saying.
Is this such a good fucking idea?

24:06.515 --> 24:09.682
Maybe we should just... like, we
should just rest for a couple days

24:09.684 --> 24:11.981
- and get ourselves a fucking gun.
- No.

24:11.983 --> 24:14.848
A proper weapon and then we can
go do that shit then.

24:14.850 --> 24:16.982
No, we can't wait.

24:16.984 --> 24:20.015
The fair's right here.
It's making plenty of noise.

24:20.017 --> 24:22.848
All hell breaks loose,
ain't nobody gonna hear shit.

24:23.783 --> 24:26.182
Now come on,
break out them fucking masks.

24:26.184 --> 24:28.749
Come on.
Let's go.

24:31.183 --> 24:32.882
I got this one for you.

24:32.884 --> 24:35.716
Yeah, buddy.
Whoo-hoo.

24:41.219 --> 24:44.285
Holy shit!
What the fuck is that?

24:45.216 --> 24:47.248
- It's a fucking mask, man.
- Ricky: ♪ Amazing Grace...

24:47.250 --> 24:49.683
It's a fucking clown mask.

24:50.850 --> 24:53.085
Well, we needed two fucking masks.

24:53.087 --> 24:55.253
And I found that there ski mask

24:55.255 --> 24:57.119
and then I found this here clown mask.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.884
And for a minute I was thinking

24:58.886 --> 25:00.850
maybe I could should go
and get another ski mask.

25:00.852 --> 25:02.817
But then I was like,
"Why the fuck would I do that?"

25:02.819 --> 25:04.651
'Cause this mask
is gonna work perfectly fine.

25:04.653 --> 25:06.518
I ain't going in there with you
wearing a fucking clown mask.

25:06.520 --> 25:08.119
Forget that.
Uh-uh.

25:09.320 --> 25:11.219
Are you scared of clowns or some shit?

25:13.219 --> 25:15.020
No.

25:15.022 --> 25:16.653
- (Yells)
- (screams)

25:16.655 --> 25:18.154
Fuckin' stop it!

25:18.156 --> 25:20.254
Randy, I'm gonna come and
get you in your sleep, boy.

25:20.256 --> 25:23.788
I ain't fucking with you.
Stop it, you fucking bastard.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.453
- (Crying) Okay? Stop it.
- (Laughing)

25:25.455 --> 25:27.087
What the fuck are you laughing at?

25:27.089 --> 25:29.021
Youse fucking scared of clowns.

25:29.023 --> 25:31.422
(Laughing)

25:31.424 --> 25:34.222
I ain't scared of shit.

25:34.224 --> 25:36.790
Fuck it. Come on,
let's go do the goddamn thing.

25:36.792 --> 25:38.587
Fucking asshole.

25:40.455 --> 25:42.889
(Ricky continues singing in distance)

25:42.891 --> 25:44.724
Fuck you.

26:00.825 --> 26:02.159
(Gun clicks)

26:08.324 --> 26:10.990
What the fuck is this bullshit here?

26:13.692 --> 26:15.192
Oh, fuck me.

26:15.194 --> 26:17.694
Hey, you put down that there gun

26:17.696 --> 26:20.225
or I'm gonna shoot you
with this fucking arrow.

26:20.227 --> 26:23.392
Fuck your arrow. I got a gun.
You put it down.

26:25.192 --> 26:28.493
You put it down and give us
all that meth you got cooked up.

26:28.495 --> 26:30.160
Stanley: Randy?

26:30.162 --> 26:31.991
- Is that you?
- Uh...

26:33.326 --> 26:35.860
- No.
- Bullshit!

26:35.862 --> 26:37.860
That's Raw Dog right there.

26:37.862 --> 26:39.127
No, it ain't.

26:39.129 --> 26:41.394
Do I look like a fucking idiot to you?

26:41.396 --> 26:45.292
You buy my shit every fucking day.
I know what you sound like.

26:49.861 --> 26:53.630
Wearing a fucking clown mask
ain't gonna scare me none.

26:53.632 --> 26:55.631
My name's not Raw Dog!

26:57.364 --> 27:00.859
I oughta fucking shoot your ass
in the head.

27:00.861 --> 27:02.861
Shit, you best get that powder

27:02.863 --> 27:04.961
or Raw Dog's gonna
shoot your ass in the head.

27:04.963 --> 27:06.428
Aha!

27:08.030 --> 27:10.096
You just said my fucking name, Randy.

27:10.098 --> 27:12.194
You just said my fucking name!

27:12.196 --> 27:14.229
(Stanley laughing)

27:14.231 --> 27:17.530
Fucking dumbasses.

27:17.532 --> 27:19.863
Raw Dog: I told you
this was a stupid fucking idea.

27:19.865 --> 27:22.430
Man, my fucking arm's getting tired.

27:22.432 --> 27:24.465
I can't fucking hold this shit any longer.

27:24.467 --> 27:26.830
The bow ain't got nothing to do with it.

27:26.832 --> 27:29.364
It ain't my fault that Stanley sits
next to his window all fucking day

27:29.366 --> 27:30.831
waiting for shit like this to happen.

27:30.833 --> 27:32.831
Well, what the fuck
are we gonna do now, huh?

27:37.534 --> 27:39.798
Oh, fuck!

27:39.800 --> 27:43.233
- Oh, what the fuck, man?
- (Stanley laughing)

27:44.868 --> 27:47.534
Fuck, Randy.
I didn't mean to fucking shoot you.

27:47.536 --> 27:49.467
(High-pitched)
Oh, what the fuck?

27:49.469 --> 27:52.066
- Fucking dumbass.
- Shut the fuck up, Stanley!

27:52.068 --> 27:53.299
Fuck, man.

27:53.301 --> 27:54.966
What the...

27:54.968 --> 27:56.535
Raw Dog:
Does it hurt?

27:56.537 --> 27:58.735
Fuck, yeah, it hurts, man!

27:58.737 --> 28:00.868
Stanley: I hope you two
don't do this for a living.

28:00.870 --> 28:01.968
- (Laughing)
- Ah!

28:01.970 --> 28:03.836
Do I pull it out?
Do I pull it out?

28:03.838 --> 28:06.399
- What do I do?
- No, I don't think so, man.

28:06.401 --> 28:08.399
- What am I gonna do?
- (Shotgun cocks)

28:08.401 --> 28:10.900
- What the fuck?
- You motherfuckers.

28:10.902 --> 28:13.736
- Vernon?
- Vernon, you in on this?

28:13.738 --> 28:15.770
Shut up.

28:15.772 --> 28:17.704
These assholes run me over

28:17.706 --> 28:20.035
and left me for dead
in the middle of nowhere.

28:20.037 --> 28:23.668
Asshole? Vernon, I wasn't the
motherfucker that ran you over.

28:23.670 --> 28:26.302
Fuck you, Raw Dog.
You left me there.

28:26.304 --> 28:28.804
Randy: Hey, just calm
the fuck down, Vernon.

28:28.806 --> 28:32.669
Look, I got a fucking arrow in me, man.

28:32.671 --> 28:34.603
(Yells)

28:34.605 --> 28:37.204
And what the hell are you doing
with my clown mask on?

28:37.206 --> 28:40.104
'Cause it was the only fucking
mask I could find, man.

28:40.106 --> 28:41.404
Easy now.

28:41.406 --> 28:43.005
Don't be pointing that shotgun in here.

28:43.007 --> 28:45.536
You know what's gonna happen
if you shoot that thing off.

28:45.538 --> 28:48.770
Yeah, you damn right I do.

28:50.939 --> 28:52.706
(Screaming)

29:02.273 --> 29:03.906
- Shit!
- Vernon: Die!

29:03.908 --> 29:05.873
Oh, shit!

29:09.141 --> 29:11.808
You know, salvation comes
in many forms.

29:11.810 --> 29:13.137
- Ha!
- Fuck, man!

29:13.139 --> 29:15.138
Today, it rolled up in a 4x4.

29:15.140 --> 29:17.139
Vernon, you damn fuck!

29:22.576 --> 29:23.608
(Raw Dog screaming)

29:23.610 --> 29:25.042
Fuck!

29:25.044 --> 29:26.640
Shit, shit, shit!

29:26.642 --> 29:28.606
(Screaming)

29:28.608 --> 29:30.907
(groans)

29:30.909 --> 29:33.740
You methy douchebag. I'm...

29:33.742 --> 29:36.875
- Stanley: No!
- Step on this, bitch!

29:36.877 --> 29:38.444
Ah!

29:45.077 --> 29:47.943
Alton: Fine. If you wanna keep
the Santa out there,

29:47.945 --> 29:51.178
it'll be Christmas year-round
in Irwin, Georgia.

29:51.180 --> 29:53.576
Johnson: You know you ain't
fooling nobody, right?

29:54.879 --> 29:58.045
It ain't got nothing to do
with it being spring time.

29:58.047 --> 30:01.112
You don't like it 'cause he's black.

30:02.046 --> 30:03.546
Why you calling me a racist?

30:03.548 --> 30:06.178
Well, you don't like black Santa Claus.

30:07.312 --> 30:08.843
And last week,

30:08.845 --> 30:11.045
you told me you don't like black porno.

30:11.047 --> 30:13.579
Now hang on a damn minute.

30:13.581 --> 30:15.481
Now that's got nothing to do with racism.

30:15.483 --> 30:16.948
I like black chicks in porno movies.

30:16.950 --> 30:19.215
I just don't like 'em with the
black guys in them, that's all.

30:19.217 --> 30:21.544
Why come?
They make you feel inadequate?

30:21.546 --> 30:23.012
No.

30:23.014 --> 30:25.446
It's because their dicks are so dark.

30:25.448 --> 30:27.079
They get to fucking,

30:27.081 --> 30:30.048
their dicks get wet,
they get glisteny and shit,

30:30.050 --> 30:33.813
and it's hard for my eyes to unfocus off it.

30:35.414 --> 30:36.880
Make me sick.

30:40.615 --> 30:43.248
Eh, well, I guess you got a
point.

30:46.881 --> 30:48.880
Hey, why come you selling that car?

30:48.882 --> 30:51.882
I told you.
I was up at a four-way stop,

30:51.884 --> 30:54.148
a big black 4x4 truck,

30:54.150 --> 30:56.817
black tinted windows
went out of turn, nearly hit me.

31:01.483 --> 31:03.050
- (Death metal music playing)
- Alton: Shit!

31:04.151 --> 31:05.718
Motherfucker.

31:05.720 --> 31:08.316
- (Tires screech)
- Fuck you, shit for brains!

31:08.318 --> 31:10.451
Learn how to drive!

31:11.385 --> 31:12.451
Fuckin' creep.

31:16.518 --> 31:18.252
Christ!

31:25.288 --> 31:28.149
- Nut job.
- Johnson: Well, who was it?

31:28.151 --> 31:30.018
I don't know.

31:31.618 --> 31:32.917
Not from around here.

31:32.919 --> 31:34.551
Had West Virginia plates.

31:34.553 --> 31:37.487
Now every time I take the car out,
fucker appears out of nowhere,

31:37.489 --> 31:38.921
tries to run me down.

31:38.923 --> 31:41.985
Well, obviously, this boy
got himself a mental problem.

31:43.053 --> 31:46.819
Why come you gonna let this
one fool make you sell your car?

31:46.821 --> 31:50.320
Look, he tried to kill me eight times.

31:50.322 --> 31:53.553
That piece-of-shit car
ain't worth dying over.

31:53.555 --> 31:55.287
I guess you got a point.

31:55.289 --> 31:58.154
(Doorbell chimes)

31:58.156 --> 31:59.722
Hi there.

32:00.823 --> 32:03.223
I'm Richard and this is Sandy.

32:03.225 --> 32:04.956
We just got married yesterday.

32:04.958 --> 32:06.987
- Congratulations.
- Ta-da.

32:06.989 --> 32:08.388
Yeah, look at that.

32:08.390 --> 32:11.723
(Exclaims) That's some rock.

32:11.725 --> 32:13.823
Listen, this is gonna sound totally nuts,

32:13.825 --> 32:17.691
but we're on our way to Orlando
for our honeymoon,

32:17.693 --> 32:20.189
and I stopped at an ATM machine

32:20.191 --> 32:22.222
and some son of a gun
hacked into my account

32:22.224 --> 32:24.123
and drained every last dime.

32:24.125 --> 32:26.758
Well, you look pretty chipper for
somebody that just got ripped off.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.392
Well, I got news for you,

32:28.394 --> 32:31.693
there's absolutely nothing
that's gonna bring me down today

32:31.695 --> 32:34.089
because I just married

32:34.091 --> 32:38.691
the most beautiful woman in the world.

32:38.693 --> 32:41.291
(Woman giggling)

32:41.293 --> 32:42.358
Mwah!

32:45.394 --> 32:47.791
We're gonna enjoy our honeymoon.

32:49.093 --> 32:52.492
And I'm confident that the bank is
gonna straighten everything out.

32:52.494 --> 32:54.726
But until then,

32:54.728 --> 32:57.094
we need a little cash for our trip.

32:57.096 --> 33:00.259
We're just gonna need a couple thousand
and we'll pick it up on the way back.

33:00.261 --> 33:02.593
Well, I ain't got that kind
of cash lying around.

33:02.595 --> 33:04.961
Folks don't come in here
with a $10,000 ring.

33:04.963 --> 33:06.693
Here.

33:06.695 --> 33:08.726
Sorry, hon.

33:09.728 --> 33:13.061
Here, here, take a look
at this baby right here.

33:13.063 --> 33:14.459
How much can you loan us on this?

33:14.461 --> 33:17.029
Just for a week or so
until the banks get back.

33:19.564 --> 33:22.129
I don't know.
Maybe four or five hundred.

33:22.131 --> 33:23.296
Are you kidding me?

33:23.298 --> 33:25.029
Four or five hundred.

33:32.930 --> 33:34.463
Alton: Can I help you
with something there?

33:34.465 --> 33:36.262
Let me see that ring.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.029
Which one?
This one here?

33:43.031 --> 33:44.995
Yes.

33:44.997 --> 33:47.596
Honey, is something wrong?

34:03.499 --> 34:05.834
(Sighs)

34:08.931 --> 34:11.199
Oh, no.

34:11.201 --> 34:13.299
Richard, what's wrong?

34:13.301 --> 34:14.998
Honey, what's the matter?

34:17.368 --> 34:19.268
Um...

34:19.270 --> 34:21.331
I'm gonna need you to wait outside.

34:21.333 --> 34:23.400
- What?
- No, no.

34:23.402 --> 34:25.501
Just wait outside.

34:25.503 --> 34:27.935
- Honey, can't you just tell me?
- Please.

34:27.937 --> 34:29.601
Outside.

34:29.603 --> 34:32.202
I'll be out in a second.
I'll explain everything.

34:35.134 --> 34:38.103
(Doorbell chimes)

34:38.105 --> 34:39.670
You okay there, mister?

34:41.571 --> 34:42.703
Where did you get this ring?

34:42.705 --> 34:44.137
No, I can't tell you
that kind of information.

34:44.139 --> 34:46.004
- Where did you get the ring?
- What are you, a parrot?

34:46.005 --> 34:48.201
I said I can't tell. Look, you think
that ring was stolen from you,

34:48.203 --> 34:50.534
- you gotta fill out a police report.
- Now, I want you to listen to me.

34:52.268 --> 34:54.202
This ring...

34:54.204 --> 34:56.268
this ring belonged to my wife.

34:57.338 --> 34:58.938
Not her.

34:59.873 --> 35:01.737
My first wife Cyndi.

35:05.038 --> 35:07.037
Six years ago,

35:07.039 --> 35:08.903
Cyndi disappeared.

35:11.405 --> 35:13.339
Her car was still in the garage.

35:13.341 --> 35:16.270
There was blood found in the driveway.

35:17.539 --> 35:20.272
So I know she didn't just run away.

35:20.274 --> 35:21.838
That wasn't Cyndi.

35:23.539 --> 35:25.806
No.

35:25.808 --> 35:28.105
She was taken from me

35:28.107 --> 35:30.072
without a trace.

35:32.674 --> 35:34.906
And, you know,
to make matters worse...

35:36.274 --> 35:38.907
I seem to be the cops'
number-one suspect.

35:40.309 --> 35:42.207
Mm-mm-mm.

35:42.209 --> 35:46.007
And now... six years later,

35:46.009 --> 35:49.042
the day after my wedding,

35:49.044 --> 35:51.310
I end up in a pawn shop...

35:51.312 --> 35:54.873
what, six, seven,
eight states away from my hometown...

35:56.940 --> 35:59.408
to find a ring

35:59.410 --> 36:01.608
that I had custom-made for her

36:01.610 --> 36:04.844
with our names inscribed in the band

36:04.846 --> 36:08.108
and you say you can't
give out information?

36:09.242 --> 36:11.475
No. You'll have to call the
cops.

36:11.477 --> 36:14.142
- Maybe they can figure it out.
- No cops.

36:14.144 --> 36:17.342
I want you to tell me
who sold you this ring.

36:17.344 --> 36:18.877
Man, I can't.

36:18.879 --> 36:20.943
All right, you listen to me.

36:20.945 --> 36:23.743
You see that diamond
you got in your hand?

36:23.745 --> 36:25.977
I want you keep that ring.

36:25.979 --> 36:29.811
That's a $17,000 ring, by the
way.

36:30.746 --> 36:33.178
All I want in exchange for it

36:33.180 --> 36:35.443
is my old ring back

36:35.445 --> 36:38.879
plus that shitty hatchback
you got for sale out front.

36:38.881 --> 36:40.347
Hmm.

36:41.381 --> 36:44.246
What is it you want?

36:44.248 --> 36:45.847
How much you give me on this?

36:45.849 --> 36:48.245
It's a valuable family heirloom.
Belonged to my granny.

36:48.247 --> 36:51.279
She's dead.
It's pretty. It's pretty.

36:52.447 --> 36:57.080
Well, I'll give you 40.

36:57.082 --> 36:58.648
Deal.

37:06.981 --> 37:09.180
His name's J.J. Thomason.

37:10.782 --> 37:14.149
Might even find him
at Lou's Fire Pit in the square.

37:14.151 --> 37:15.848
He's a cook there.

37:15.850 --> 37:19.214
Now don't tell nobody I told you nothing.

37:26.952 --> 37:28.916
- Don't.
- Johnson: I...

37:28.918 --> 37:30.249
- Don't say...
- I'm just saying...

37:30.251 --> 37:31.816
Just don't say nothing.

37:32.884 --> 37:35.382
Richard, what is going on?

37:35.384 --> 37:38.417
- I need you to go back home.
- What?

37:38.419 --> 37:40.651
Take the car and go back to Connecticut.

37:40.653 --> 37:42.450
But... no, no, no, no.
We're on our honeymoon

37:42.452 --> 37:44.852
and now you want me to just drive home?

37:44.854 --> 37:46.752
I wanna know what the hell is going on.

37:46.754 --> 37:48.285
It's a private matter.

37:48.287 --> 37:49.852
Private?
It's private?

37:49.854 --> 37:52.219
There is no private.
We just got married.

37:52.221 --> 37:55.250
You can't just drive off
without an explanation.

37:55.252 --> 37:57.550
I'm your wife.

37:57.552 --> 37:59.886
- (Sighs)
- (engine starts)

37:59.888 --> 38:02.353
I already have a wife.

38:02.355 --> 38:03.620
What are you talking about?

38:05.156 --> 38:07.287
Why are you doing this to me?

38:08.918 --> 38:10.917
Richard?

38:11.886 --> 38:14.352
Richard, come back!

38:14.354 --> 38:16.553
Richard, don't go.

38:16.555 --> 38:19.520

you noticed that I was in town.

39:59.397 --> 40:02.231
I'm doing a tribute show to the King

40:02.233 --> 40:04.364
down at the county fair later on.

40:04.366 --> 40:06.297
Big news story about it and everything.

40:06.299 --> 40:07.997
Gonna be on the news
later on this afternoon.

40:07.999 --> 40:10.162
Even put a poster in the window.
You should check it out.

40:11.163 --> 40:13.263
It's against the rules.

40:13.265 --> 40:14.865
Management.

40:18.432 --> 40:20.065
Say, I was wondering if maybe

40:20.067 --> 40:23.796
you would perhaps be interested
in trading a little lunch

40:23.798 --> 40:27.531
for a pair of front-row tickets.

40:27.533 --> 40:29.464
I don't go to the fair.

40:29.466 --> 40:32.465
And we only take cash for food here.

40:32.467 --> 40:33.832
Hmm.

40:33.834 --> 40:37.965
How 'bout just a couple
scrambled eggs for the tickets?

40:37.967 --> 40:40.631
We only take cash here, mister.

40:42.299 --> 40:44.298
You are gonna pay for that coffee, right?

40:44.300 --> 40:46.867
- How 'bout the tickets for the coffee?
- It's $1.20.

41:01.003 --> 41:04.902
Um, I'm about 16 cents short here.

41:04.904 --> 41:09.269
How 'bout you take that
and the two tickets?

41:10.303 --> 41:12.536
You can keep 'em, honey.

41:14.772 --> 41:17.769
I can't take this shit no more.

41:17.771 --> 41:20.504
Theresa, hey.
Baby, where are you going?

41:20.506 --> 41:21.604
Hey there. Hey there.
Hey there.

41:21.606 --> 41:23.238
Come on, now.
What's your problem?

41:23.240 --> 41:26.572
- What's your problem?
- I can't live like this anymore, Ricky.

41:26.574 --> 41:28.935
Shug, what's the matter?

41:28.937 --> 41:31.168
We're traveling around.

41:31.170 --> 41:33.436
We're seeing new places.

41:33.438 --> 41:35.836
We're rocking it out to the King.

41:35.838 --> 41:39.038
The places we travel
ain't nowhere I wanna see.

41:40.140 --> 41:41.906
We're broke, hungry,

41:41.908 --> 41:44.637
your car smells like shit for some reason,

41:44.639 --> 41:46.138
and I'm tired of it.

41:46.140 --> 41:49.772
All right, first of all,
I do not know what that smell is.

41:49.774 --> 41:51.838
And second of all...

41:53.407 --> 41:54.973
this is me, baby.

41:56.339 --> 41:58.239
I'm living the life of the King.

41:58.241 --> 42:00.073
And I ain't giving it up for no one.

42:00.075 --> 42:02.940
You ain't living the life of the King.

42:02.942 --> 42:05.607
You don't have his money,
his voice,

42:05.609 --> 42:07.107
or his looks.

42:10.240 --> 42:12.908
Well, there is one thing that I do have.

42:12.910 --> 42:14.075
And what's that?

42:14.077 --> 42:16.975
Skin without worms crawling through it.

42:20.509 --> 42:22.506
I'm sorry, King.

42:22.508 --> 42:24.074
Forgive me.

42:24.076 --> 42:26.008
It was my jealousy.

42:27.076 --> 42:29.443
Hold my hand.
Help me.

42:29.445 --> 42:32.109
- King...
- I'm outta here, Ricky.

42:32.111 --> 42:33.677
Outta here?
Where are you going?

42:33.679 --> 42:37.007
You're 200 miles from anywhere
near anywhere...

42:37.009 --> 42:39.142
I can get around anywhere I'm at

42:39.144 --> 42:41.442
because I got one thing you don't.

42:41.444 --> 42:42.908
Oh, yeah?
What's that?

42:42.910 --> 42:44.276
A pussy.

42:45.879 --> 42:47.744
Can't argue with that.

42:47.746 --> 42:48.978
Fine.

42:48.980 --> 42:50.810
Go on.
Get outta here.

42:50.812 --> 42:52.077
You're making a big mistake!

42:52.079 --> 42:55.742
I'll be at the Ramada Express
in no time flat.

42:55.744 --> 42:58.109
They said they'd love to have me back.

42:58.111 --> 43:01.045
That was eight years ago, Ricky.

43:02.413 --> 43:03.978
They didn't say when!

43:16.846 --> 43:19.045
(Engine starts)

43:33.516 --> 43:37.082
♪ And I'm feelin' good.

43:37.084 --> 43:38.716
Hello, sir.

43:38.718 --> 43:40.450
Is your soul saved?

43:42.484 --> 43:44.213
Fuck off.

43:46.415 --> 43:49.915
I really gotta work on my approach.

43:52.852 --> 43:54.151
I'm looking for J.J.

43:54.153 --> 43:55.950
He's in the back.
I'll let him know you're out here.

43:55.952 --> 43:57.516
- Don't bother.
- Hey.

43:57.518 --> 43:59.482
You can't go back there.

43:59.484 --> 44:00.816
Hey!

44:00.818 --> 44:02.415
I said you can't go back there.

44:02.417 --> 44:03.649
Ooh!

44:03.651 --> 44:05.017
Who's J.J.?

44:09.053 --> 44:11.483
- You J.J.?
- Yeah. Who the hell are you?

44:11.485 --> 44:13.452
I told him he couldn't come back here.

44:13.454 --> 44:15.519
Where'd you get this ring?

44:17.218 --> 44:18.817
What, you a cop?

44:18.819 --> 44:21.318
- No.
- (Chuckles)

44:21.320 --> 44:23.550
Then fuck off.

44:27.487 --> 44:29.553
(Screaming)

44:30.821 --> 44:32.553
I asked you nicely.

44:32.555 --> 44:35.753
Get off me!
Get off me!

44:35.755 --> 44:39.252
The ring... you gonna tell me
where you got it?

44:39.254 --> 44:40.887
Fuck you!

44:43.221 --> 44:45.388
You're gonna tell me...

44:45.390 --> 44:47.556
where... you got it.

44:49.853 --> 44:51.852
(Groaning)

44:55.154 --> 44:56.887
(screaming)

44:56.889 --> 45:00.322
- (sizzling)
- (screaming)

45:04.555 --> 45:08.088
- J.J.: No!
- Two choices:

45:08.090 --> 45:10.622
tell me where you got the ring or die.

45:10.624 --> 45:13.589
Okay, okay. It was my uncle.
I stole it from my uncle.

45:14.992 --> 45:16.755
- Your uncle?
- Yeah.

45:16.757 --> 45:18.221
Who is he and where do I find him?

45:18.223 --> 45:19.923
His name is Ben Thomason.

45:19.925 --> 45:22.723
He lives about a mile off the highway

45:22.725 --> 45:26.324
on Ivy Street in a gray house
next to a purple house.

45:26.326 --> 45:28.859
(Country music playing over radio)

45:28.861 --> 45:30.423
(car turns off)

45:41.560 --> 45:44.024
- Can I help you with your bags?
- Jesus Christ!

45:44.992 --> 45:46.659
You scared the piss outta me.

45:46.661 --> 45:48.761
Who are you?

45:48.763 --> 45:51.161
That's not important.

45:51.163 --> 45:52.961
What's important is...

45:53.896 --> 45:55.529
where did you get this?

45:55.531 --> 45:57.391
My ring.

45:58.893 --> 46:00.359
That's mine.
Where'd you get it?

46:00.361 --> 46:01.859
I asked you first.

46:01.861 --> 46:03.293
That's none of your damn business.

46:03.295 --> 46:05.026
Someone stole it from me
and I want it back.

46:06.662 --> 46:09.029
Well, I'm afraid you can't have it back.

46:09.031 --> 46:11.194
Somebody stole it from me first.

46:11.196 --> 46:14.227
Now, you wanna tell me
where you got this ring?

46:14.229 --> 46:16.828
You wanna tell me where you got it?

46:16.830 --> 46:19.060
This is my damn house.

46:19.062 --> 46:21.963
You don't just show up
demanding shit around here.

46:21.965 --> 46:24.694
All right, how about this?

46:24.696 --> 46:27.297
I'll tell you where I got it

46:27.299 --> 46:29.263
and then you tell me where you got it.

46:29.265 --> 46:30.762
Deal?

46:33.030 --> 46:34.564
Deal.

46:34.566 --> 46:37.061
Like I said,

46:37.063 --> 46:40.231
this ring was taken from me
a long time ago.

46:41.764 --> 46:45.430
But where I got it today
was in a pawn shop.

46:47.499 --> 46:51.364
Your nephew sold it there
after he stole it from you.

46:51.366 --> 46:53.229
J.J.?

46:57.200 --> 46:59.366
I fucking knew it.

47:00.468 --> 47:03.234
Oh, that little bitch.

47:06.063 --> 47:09.265
All right, your turn.

47:10.699 --> 47:13.000
I won it in a poker game about a year ago.

47:13.002 --> 47:15.234
Really?
From who?

47:15.236 --> 47:17.298
Johnny Shaw.

47:19.066 --> 47:21.132
What can you tell me about him?

47:21.134 --> 47:23.132
He's a good guy.

47:23.134 --> 47:25.432
Gets his haircut at Doc's,
so he's okay by me.

47:25.434 --> 47:26.901
Where does he live?

47:28.869 --> 47:31.000
I answered the question.
I told you where I got the ring.

47:31.002 --> 47:32.934
That was the deal.

47:32.936 --> 47:34.835
I ain't gonna start giving out information

47:34.837 --> 47:36.768
to some guy who just pops up
at my house.

47:36.770 --> 47:38.302
Now give me the damn ring.

47:38.304 --> 47:39.769
I don't think so.

47:39.771 --> 47:42.203
It's mine.

47:42.205 --> 47:44.468
No, it was my ring first.

47:46.503 --> 47:48.871
And I'm not leaving here

47:48.873 --> 47:51.571
until you tell me where I
can find this Johnny Shaw.

47:51.573 --> 47:53.638
No.

47:55.205 --> 47:57.038
No, you ain't leaving here

47:57.040 --> 47:59.436
until you give me back my damn ring.

48:02.473 --> 48:04.438
So I guess it's gonna get ugly, then.

48:04.440 --> 48:06.771
Oh, I reckon.

48:34.775 --> 48:36.341
(Coughs)

48:53.109 --> 48:55.242
Okay, you son of a bitch...

48:55.244 --> 48:56.709
last chance.

48:56.711 --> 48:59.309
- Where's Johnny?
- (Groans)

49:00.877 --> 49:03.143
- Fuck you.
- (Sirens blaring)

49:03.145 --> 49:04.907
Fuck you!

49:08.544 --> 49:10.644
Stubborn son of a bitch.

49:22.243 --> 49:26.444
...lives by day and is the King by night.

49:27.647 --> 49:30.445
- Hi.
- Meet Ricky Baldoski...

49:45.679 --> 49:47.545
I'm just living the dream here,
you know.

49:47.547 --> 49:49.847
Okay, you can hold it.
You know...

49:49.849 --> 49:52.147
Just living the dream and traveling around.

49:52.149 --> 49:53.780
You know, uh,

49:53.782 --> 49:56.315
see people, go places,

49:56.317 --> 49:59.180
like, just rocking it out...

49:59.182 --> 50:01.916
There we go.

50:01.918 --> 50:03.649
There you are, Johnny.

50:11.549 --> 50:13.748
...some of your big influences are, Ricky.

50:13.750 --> 50:17.383
Well, definitely.
The King, um, King and the King.

50:17.385 --> 50:19.417
- KKK all the way.
- You can catch Ricky...

50:19.419 --> 50:20.750
- Wait, no...
- ...this weekend

50:20.752 --> 50:24.285
performing his tribute
performance to the King.

50:24.287 --> 50:27.248
Ricky: I'd like to just say one word:
God bless America!

50:27.250 --> 50:29.116
Connie: Irwin County Fair.

50:29.118 --> 50:30.683
Back to you, Michael.

51:02.321 --> 51:03.920
(Rifle cocks)

51:28.157 --> 51:30.224
(door creaking)

51:32.087 --> 51:34.687
(women moaning)

51:42.291 --> 51:44.723
(women's voices overlapping) Johnny.

51:44.725 --> 51:47.322
- Yes, Johnny.
- Yes, Johnny.

51:47.324 --> 51:51.024
- Johnny, please give it to me.
- Yes, Johnny.

51:51.026 --> 51:53.256
- (Moans)
- (repetitive slapping)

51:53.258 --> 51:55.291
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

51:55.293 --> 51:57.358
(Continues indistinctly)

51:58.524 --> 52:00.157
Johnny: Yeah.

52:01.625 --> 52:03.258
Woman: Yes.

52:05.592 --> 52:08.025
Oh, yes, Johnny.
Oh, yeah.

52:08.027 --> 52:10.027
- Just like that.
- (Slapping continues)

52:10.029 --> 52:12.826
- (woman moans)
- Woman #2: Harder.

52:12.828 --> 52:14.994
(Conversation continues)

52:56.430 --> 53:00.029
- Richard: Smile, Cyndi.
- Stop, I look terrible.

53:00.031 --> 53:02.630
- You always look beautiful.
- (Camera whirs)

53:05.363 --> 53:08.564
- (laughs)
- Come on, Cyndi. Do one more.

53:19.597 --> 53:21.665
(Moaning, slapping continues)

53:27.632 --> 53:29.499
(panting)

53:39.534 --> 53:41.867
How you doing, player?

53:43.236 --> 53:45.631
I've been better.

53:45.633 --> 53:47.565
I bet you have.

53:49.466 --> 53:51.301
You wanna put it away, Johnny?

53:54.769 --> 53:56.535
(Zipper zips)

54:11.438 --> 54:14.002
You like to go fishing, do you?

54:14.004 --> 54:16.069
When I get the time.

54:22.439 --> 54:24.804
You, uh...

54:24.806 --> 54:26.269
you wanna tell me
why you're in my house

54:26.271 --> 54:28.170
with a gun pointed at my head?

54:34.941 --> 54:36.840
(Groans)

54:38.607 --> 54:40.737
You wanna tell me where you got this ring?

54:43.306 --> 54:45.207
I ain't never seen it before.

54:45.209 --> 54:46.773
Really?

54:46.775 --> 54:49.374
Well...

54:49.376 --> 54:51.608
I hear you lost it in a poker game.

54:53.206 --> 54:56.005
I don't know what you're talking about.

54:56.007 --> 54:59.873
You don't know what I'm talking about?

54:59.875 --> 55:02.141
Well, there's a picture of my wife,

55:02.143 --> 55:04.908
the woman I gave this ring to,

55:04.910 --> 55:07.040
on your refrigerator.

55:08.507 --> 55:10.607
You don't know what I'm talking about?

55:10.609 --> 55:15.007
Say you don't know what I'm
talking about again, motherfucker.

55:15.009 --> 55:18.143
- Please...
- Say it! Go ahead and fucking say it!

55:18.145 --> 55:20.641
- Pl... please.
- Shut up!

55:22.009 --> 55:23.275
(Whimpers)

55:28.008 --> 55:30.642
You wanna tell me the truth, Johnny?

55:30.644 --> 55:33.675
I... I found a pocketbook.

55:33.677 --> 55:36.044
The ring was in it.
That's all I know.

55:37.312 --> 55:39.376
And the picture?

55:39.378 --> 55:41.144
Was that in the pocketbook, too?

55:41.146 --> 55:43.144
Yeah.

55:43.146 --> 55:45.678
And you decided to just
hang it up on your fridge?

55:45.680 --> 55:47.576
Look, I don't know any more.

55:47.578 --> 55:50.177
I found it. The picture was pretty,
so I hung it up.

55:50.179 --> 55:52.177
I can't tell you nothing more.

55:52.179 --> 55:53.679
Look, if you don't believe me,

55:53.681 --> 55:56.147
you can just go ahead and kill me.

55:56.149 --> 55:59.910
I'm gonna kill you, Johnny.

55:59.912 --> 56:03.211
Just how long it takes...
that's up to you.

56:10.380 --> 56:12.180
(Women continue moaning on TV)

56:17.780 --> 56:21.213
(shouting)

56:22.981 --> 56:25.415
Johnny: What the hell did you do to me?

56:37.051 --> 56:39.015
(Shouting)

56:49.251 --> 56:51.317
(cries out)

56:52.284 --> 56:56.016
Sometimes a picture really
is worth a thousand words.

56:56.018 --> 56:57.617
Shh.

57:06.916 --> 57:08.649
Check this out.

57:10.952 --> 57:12.817
It's called a flail.

57:12.819 --> 57:14.252
(Whimpers)

57:14.254 --> 57:16.753
You know, I'd start with this,

57:16.755 --> 57:19.386
but then I might as well just...

57:19.388 --> 57:22.352
shoot you in the head
with that rifle over there

57:22.354 --> 57:24.419
'cause this would kill you pretty quick.

57:25.920 --> 57:27.484
Luckily...

57:28.452 --> 57:31.153
I stumbled onto these two items

57:31.155 --> 57:33.420
laying around your house.

57:34.754 --> 57:36.921
Why don't we get creative?

57:39.021 --> 57:40.353
It's simple.

57:40.355 --> 57:42.687
Tell me what happened to my wife.

57:46.554 --> 57:49.688
"I don't know"
is a bad thing to say, Johnny.

57:50.989 --> 57:53.155
- (Teeth shatter)
- (screaming)

57:55.823 --> 57:57.823
This is just the beginning.

57:57.825 --> 57:59.623
We can do this all day.

57:59.625 --> 58:01.821
(Gurgling)

58:05.591 --> 58:08.790
Yes, please.

58:08.792 --> 58:11.391
Please, tell me what you did with my wife.

58:11.393 --> 58:13.221
Tell me how you raped and killed her

58:13.223 --> 58:17.022
so I can kill you and I can get
some fucking closure with my life.

58:18.257 --> 58:19.723
(Crying)

58:19.725 --> 58:21.757
Tell me what you did to my fucking wife!

58:24.526 --> 58:26.226
And I told you about saying that.

58:40.059 --> 58:41.691
Don't you fuck with me.

58:42.825 --> 58:43.959
Don't fuck with me.

58:43.961 --> 58:45.226
Don't you fuck with me!

59:03.096 --> 59:04.661
Yes. Yes.

01:00:11.335 --> 01:00:13.765
Cyndi... oh, my God.

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:19.368
Baby, it's okay.
It's okay, I'm here.

01:00:26.937 --> 01:00:28.498
Cyndi.

01:00:31.767 --> 01:00:33.801
Come on, Cyndi.

01:00:35.201 --> 01:00:37.304
It's me.

01:00:37.306 --> 01:00:38.903
It's me, Richard.

01:00:40.071 --> 01:00:43.602
Cyndi, it's your husband.
That's it.

01:00:43.604 --> 01:00:45.336
Come on, Cyndi.

01:00:46.703 --> 01:00:48.269

Don't worry, baby.

01:01:00.107 --> 01:01:02.071
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

01:01:02.073 --> 01:01:03.938
I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:06.305

01:01:06.307 --> 01:01:08.670

01:01:14.574 --> 01:01:16.907
- I'm gonna take you home now.
- I am home.

01:01:16.909 --> 01:01:18.174

01:01:19.709 --> 01:01:21.372
Go away.

01:01:21.374 --> 01:01:23.939
Cyndi, please, listen to me.

01:01:23.941 --> 01:01:26.341
You're not thinking right.

01:01:26.343 --> 01:01:28.407
Come on, it's time to go.

01:01:28.409 --> 01:01:30.307
Cyndi...

it's me, Richard.

01:01:32.978 --> 01:01:34.771
Get out.

01:01:36.341 --> 01:01:38.206
Listen to me, Cyndi.

01:01:38.208 --> 01:01:41.707
This... I don't know the term for this,

01:01:41.709 --> 01:01:43.809
but I saw it on television somewhere,

01:01:43.811 --> 01:01:46.243
where the...

01:01:46.245 --> 01:01:49.874
the victim starts to sympathize
with the captor.

01:01:49.876 --> 01:01:51.841
Well, that's what's happened to you.

01:01:51.843 --> 01:01:55.108
You need help.
Just... it's time to go home.

01:01:55.110 --> 01:01:57.577
Cyndi, listen to me.
It's time to go home!

01:01:57.579 --> 01:01:59.144
Get out!
(Growls, hisses)

01:02:24.447 --> 01:02:26.478
You have her caged like a fucking dog?

01:02:28.777 --> 01:02:30.143
Yeah, well, unfortunately,

01:02:30.145 --> 01:02:32.478
I haven't been a man of my word lately.

I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.

01:03:06.252 --> 01:03:09.581
It's just you're not...
you're not thinking straight.

01:03:10.515 --> 01:03:13.216
I can't even imagine
what you've been through.

01:03:13.218 --> 01:03:15.249

I... I've got my own silo.

01:03:36.385 --> 01:03:40.086
And Johnny lets me go in

01:03:44.355 --> 01:03:45.487
Yeah?

Yeah, but...

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.564
Hang in there.
Son of a... oh.

01:12:28.566 --> 01:12:30.629
No, no, no.
No, no, not now.

01:12:30.631 --> 01:12:32.996
Not... not now.
No, no, please, please.

01:12:32.998 --> 01:12:34.531
Come on.
I'm begging you, sweetheart.

01:12:34.533 --> 01:12:36.498
Come on.

01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.198
Baby, forgive me.

01:12:39.200 --> 01:12:40.999
- (Engine knocks)
- Oh, come on, baby.

01:12:41.001 --> 01:12:44.897
I'm just saying, if you're gonna
build a robot that speaks English

01:12:44.899 --> 01:12:48.431
to go back in time to kill people,
why give it an accent?

01:12:48.433 --> 01:12:50.765
That just don't make sense to me.

01:12:50.767 --> 01:12:53.599
- ♪ Again.
- Come on, baby.

01:12:57.400 --> 01:12:59.331
What in the blue hell is you talking about?

01:12:59.333 --> 01:13:02.365
Arnold Schwarzenegger is from Austria.

01:13:02.367 --> 01:13:04.300
Austria, Australia,

01:13:04.302 --> 01:13:06.466
it's the same thing without the "alia."

01:13:14.135 --> 01:13:16.868
- (Doorbell chiming)
- Hello.

01:13:16.870 --> 01:13:18.267
Hi there.

01:13:19.901 --> 01:13:21.535
Who are you supposed to be, Liberace?

01:13:21.537 --> 01:13:23.899
(Chuckles) Heck, no.

01:13:23.901 --> 01:13:26.968
I do a little tribute show to the King.

01:13:26.970 --> 01:13:28.636
- That's right.
- Uh-huh.

01:13:28.638 --> 01:13:30.202
Going back to the county fair.

01:13:30.204 --> 01:13:32.203
Gonna be a big show.
Big, big show.

01:13:32.205 --> 01:13:34.203
- I'm doing two shows tonight.
- (Flies buzzing)

01:13:34.205 --> 01:13:35.936
- (sniffs)
- And one on Saturday and one Sunday.

01:13:35.938 --> 01:13:39.001
And there's gonna be a big news show
on it and everything on Channel 7.

01:13:39.003 --> 01:13:41.536
Now, listen.

01:13:41.538 --> 01:13:43.237
I'm a little strapped right now

01:13:43.239 --> 01:13:45.138
'cause they don't pay me out till Monday.

01:13:52.236 --> 01:13:53.970
(Blows)

01:13:57.804 --> 01:14:00.537
Well, what do you want?

01:14:00.539 --> 01:14:02.105
You want to pawn that suit?

01:14:02.107 --> 01:14:03.638
Heck, no.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.271
- 'Cause I was gonna say...
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:14:06.273 --> 01:14:08.171
The thing is I...

01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.371
I would,
on principle only,

01:14:12.373 --> 01:14:14.905
never perform without this

01:14:14.907 --> 01:14:17.405
because this, my friend,

01:14:17.407 --> 01:14:20.839
belonged to the King himself.

01:14:20.841 --> 01:14:23.039
- Elvis Presley?
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:23.041 --> 01:14:24.773
Bullshit.

01:14:24.775 --> 01:14:26.907
If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'.

01:14:26.909 --> 01:14:28.609
24-karat gold.

01:14:32.141 --> 01:14:34.575
What do you say?
Take a look?

01:14:34.577 --> 01:14:36.342
Let's see.

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:45.342
I don't care if it belonged to Ronald
McDonald as long as it's gold.

01:14:47.208 --> 01:14:48.575
What do you need?

01:14:48.577 --> 01:14:51.677
Um, I'll take, say...

01:14:52.878 --> 01:14:55.211
- 200?
- I can swing that.

01:14:55.213 --> 01:14:57.046
All right, then.

01:14:57.048 --> 01:14:59.207
Uh... very good.

01:14:59.209 --> 01:15:00.807
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:15:00.809 --> 01:15:03.709
You... you take good care of my baby.

01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.245
Damn, that's no good.

01:15:26.247 --> 01:15:28.413
No, no, no.
Can't have that in the show.

01:15:28.415 --> 01:15:30.180
I need a barber shop.

01:15:30.182 --> 01:15:31.912
Where's a barber shop at?

01:16:08.216 --> 01:16:09.282
(Sniffs)

01:16:46.586 --> 01:16:48.920
Fans.

01:16:48.922 --> 01:16:51.454
This town is loco.

01:16:51.456 --> 01:16:54.421
Well, with a name like Doc's,
you can't go wrong.

01:16:55.488 --> 01:16:58.119
- (Cheers)
- (groans)

01:17:11.586 --> 01:17:14.386
- Good afternoon.
- How you doing?

01:17:14.388 --> 01:17:15.821
Have a seat.

01:17:15.823 --> 01:17:19.055
These gentlemen ain't doing
anything but wasting time.

01:17:19.057 --> 01:17:21.256
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:29.822
Okay.

01:17:39.757 --> 01:17:42.091
Now then, I don't need a cut.

01:17:42.093 --> 01:17:46.289
I just want you to even up
these here sideburns.

01:17:47.224 --> 01:17:50.059
That's an awful lot of hair.
You sure you don't want a trim?

01:17:50.061 --> 01:17:51.790
Oh, no.
It's perfect for the show.

01:17:51.792 --> 01:17:53.157
The show?

01:17:53.159 --> 01:17:54.960
Oh, what are you, in the circus?

01:17:54.962 --> 01:17:56.826
No, no.
I'm in the county fair.

01:17:56.828 --> 01:17:58.692
Oh.

01:17:58.694 --> 01:18:00.592
What are you, the magician?

01:18:00.594 --> 01:18:03.859
No. I ain't no magician.

01:18:04.992 --> 01:18:06.924
I do a tribute show.

01:18:06.926 --> 01:18:08.460
Doc: A tribute... what's that?

01:18:08.462 --> 01:18:10.927
You show people
how to sew sequins on outfits?

01:18:10.929 --> 01:18:12.027
- (Clippers buzzing)
- Pshh.

01:18:12.029 --> 01:18:14.127
I don't show people how to put sequins...

01:18:15.363 --> 01:18:16.995
- Hey!
- (Buzzing stops)

01:18:16.997 --> 01:18:19.224
What the hell?!

01:18:21.293 --> 01:18:23.592
What do you think you're doing?

01:18:23.594 --> 01:18:25.492
I'm cutting your hair.

01:18:25.494 --> 01:18:27.995
I told you to even out my sideburns.

01:18:27.997 --> 01:18:30.129
You nearly took this flap right off.

01:18:30.131 --> 01:18:33.994
Son, I don't know how they
cut hair in the big city,

01:18:33.996 --> 01:18:36.727
- but here, that's it.
- I'm from South Carolina.

01:18:36.729 --> 01:18:40.194
- Sweet Jesus, I'm outta here.
- Hey, you owe me $12.

01:18:40.196 --> 01:18:42.429
You... (grunts)

01:18:48.664 --> 01:18:50.430
One for the money.

01:18:50.432 --> 01:18:52.197
Two for the show.

01:18:53.498 --> 01:18:55.332
10 for a lousy haircut.

01:18:56.333 --> 01:18:58.929
You know what?
I'll take some of that to go.

01:18:58.931 --> 01:19:00.496
(Grunts)

01:19:07.933 --> 01:19:11.066
- Man: I can't believe he chose Doc's.
- Woman: Oh, he's gonna regret that.

01:19:11.068 --> 01:19:12.464
- Hey.
- Hi. Hey there.

01:19:12.466 --> 01:19:13.864
- Welcome to Irwin.
- Thank you.

01:19:13.866 --> 01:19:16.498
So you are a Doc man, huh?

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:17.800
Hell, no!

01:19:17.802 --> 01:19:19.500
Look what he done to me.
He butchered me.

01:19:19.502 --> 01:19:21.500
I'm gonna try Cook's.
(Muttering)

01:19:21.502 --> 01:19:23.268
(crowd murmuring)

01:19:23.270 --> 01:19:26.097
- Looks like Doc can't cut the mustard.
- (Clamoring)

01:19:38.170 --> 01:19:40.500
Howdy.

01:19:40.502 --> 01:19:42.833
Good afternoon.

01:19:42.835 --> 01:19:44.634
Have a seat.

01:19:44.636 --> 01:19:46.800
These old-timers are just wasting time.

01:19:46.802 --> 01:19:49.035
(Chuckles)

01:19:49.037 --> 01:19:51.637
Looks like some commotion's
going on out there, huh?

01:19:51.639 --> 01:19:55.336
Yeah, looks to me like the loony boon...

01:19:55.338 --> 01:19:58.069
loony tune bin just dropped off
a bunch of mental patients

01:19:58.071 --> 01:20:00.902
on a field trip or something there.

01:20:00.904 --> 01:20:03.669
So what are you,
some kind of magician?

01:20:03.671 --> 01:20:06.201
No, I'm not a magician.

01:20:06.203 --> 01:20:08.102
Say, do you have a TV?
Do you know what time it is?

01:20:08.104 --> 01:20:10.204
Could you put on...

01:20:10.206 --> 01:20:11.237
(TV turns on)

01:20:11.239 --> 01:20:14.304
Connie: ...the King by night.

01:20:14.306 --> 01:20:17.237
- Hi.
- Meet Ricky Baldoski.

01:20:17.239 --> 01:20:20.603
He's a volunteer emergency
medical service technician by day

01:20:20.605 --> 01:20:22.603
and, as you can probably guess,

01:20:22.605 --> 01:20:26.305
does Elvis tribute performances by night.

01:20:26.307 --> 01:20:27.604
- (Chuckles)
- So, Ricky, tell us

01:20:27.606 --> 01:20:30.040
- a little bit about yourself.
- Uh-huh.

01:20:30.042 --> 01:20:32.503
Well, now, looks like
we got ourselves

01:20:32.505 --> 01:20:34.703
a celebrity in the house, huh?

01:20:34.705 --> 01:20:37.037
Pssh, come on now.
I'm just glad to be here.

01:20:37.039 --> 01:20:40.105
Just glad to be here.

01:20:40.107 --> 01:20:43.040
You know, I actually was a little bit
nervous during that there interview.

01:20:43.042 --> 01:20:44.641
They asked a lot of questions
and everything,

01:20:44.643 --> 01:20:46.871
but I had my sign up.
I think that just...

01:20:46.873 --> 01:20:49.206
What in the Hades is going on out there?

01:20:49.208 --> 01:20:51.440
Looks like a riot.

01:20:51.442 --> 01:20:53.606
I don't mean no offense
or anything like that,

01:20:53.608 --> 01:20:57.808
but there's something a little
bit whacko about this town.

01:20:57.810 --> 01:21:00.540
The oyster brain next door,

01:21:00.542 --> 01:21:04.075
I asked him just to even up my sideburns

01:21:04.077 --> 01:21:05.741
and, son of a gun,

01:21:05.743 --> 01:21:08.475
- he just chopped this side...
- Excuse me.

01:21:08.477 --> 01:21:10.643
- You went next door first?
- Yes.

01:21:14.910 --> 01:21:17.210
Do I look like sloppy seconds to you, boy?

01:21:17.212 --> 01:21:20.410
You decide to be a Doc man,
you stay a Doc man.

01:21:20.412 --> 01:21:22.310
I ain't no second choice.

01:21:22.312 --> 01:21:24.610
Sir, I just asked him to even up my burns

01:21:24.612 --> 01:21:26.842
because one of them's a little
higher than the other one

01:21:26.844 --> 01:21:28.375
and he cut half of it off.

01:21:28.377 --> 01:21:31.878
Now if you could be so kind to
just please trim this one so it...

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.144
(gasps, screams)

01:21:34.146 --> 01:21:37.013
You... what the heck?

01:21:38.281 --> 01:21:39.909
That'll be $12.

01:21:39.911 --> 01:21:41.943
You cut me?

01:21:43.511 --> 01:21:46.676
Y'all are cuckoo in this town.
Whacky crazy.

01:21:46.678 --> 01:21:48.511
Oh, we're whackos, huh?

01:21:48.513 --> 01:21:51.747
You come in here in your fancy
suit and your boufed-up hairdo

01:21:51.749 --> 01:21:54.579
and you can't even figure out what
barber you want to cut your hair.

01:21:54.581 --> 01:21:57.045
We don't care for you
Hollywood types around here.

01:21:57.047 --> 01:22:00.145
I am from South
nutter-butter-lovin' Carolina.

01:22:00.147 --> 01:22:01.878
I don't care
where you're from. Get!

01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:04.180
(Grunts)

01:22:09.947 --> 01:22:11.514
Get out of my way!

01:22:13.948 --> 01:22:15.181
Out of my way!

01:22:16.649 --> 01:22:17.982
(Car engine starts)

01:22:48.115 --> 01:22:49.615
Thank you.

01:22:51.351 --> 01:22:55.318

Good evening, sir.

01:23:26.256 --> 01:23:28.053
Hello.

01:23:28.055 --> 01:23:30.655
You're not from around here,
are you?

01:23:30.657 --> 01:23:32.356
Heck, no.

01:23:32.358 --> 01:23:35.389
Bunch of psychos in this town.

01:23:35.391 --> 01:23:39.055
You caused some kind of
commotion up at the barber shops.

01:23:39.057 --> 01:23:43.655
What kind of whacko town only lets
you get your haircut in one place?

01:23:44.856 --> 01:23:46.556
Well, that's just the way it is.

01:23:46.558 --> 01:23:49.589
You're either a Cook man
or you a Doc man.

01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:51.624
Everything needs its balance

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:54.922
and you done come along here
and unbalanced everything.

01:23:54.924 --> 01:23:56.755
Huh.

01:23:56.757 --> 01:23:58.122
Okay.

01:23:59.623 --> 01:24:01.824
Can I ask you a question?

01:24:03.225 --> 01:24:04.858
(Snaps fingers) Shoot.

01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:10.422
You ever feel lost?

01:24:12.491 --> 01:24:14.557
Sometimes.

01:24:14.559 --> 01:24:17.726
You ever feel like

01:24:17.728 --> 01:24:19.827
you're giving life everything you got,

01:24:19.829 --> 01:24:22.991
but you just can't get
to where you want to be?

01:24:24.959 --> 01:24:26.158
Who are you,

01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:28.158
some kind of mind reader
or something like that?

01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:30.926
What if I could help you find

01:24:30.928 --> 01:24:33.059
what you're looking for?

01:24:34.325 --> 01:24:37.394
What if I could put you in that place

01:24:37.396 --> 01:24:40.561
that you've always wanted to be in?

01:24:42.328 --> 01:24:45.693
What if by just saying one little bitty word,

01:24:45.695 --> 01:24:50.393
that I could grant you everything
that you've ever really wanted?

01:24:55.230 --> 01:24:59.030

01:40:03.342 --> 01:40:05.405
All right. Whoa. Nothing.
That's freaky.

01:40:05.407 --> 01:40:07.673
Okay.
Take all the time you need!

01:40:11.640 --> 01:40:14.374
I hear you're looking for a place to stay.

01:40:15.842 --> 01:40:18.441
I've got an open spot
if you need a few days

01:40:18.443 --> 01:40:20.274
to get your feet back on the ground.

01:40:20.276 --> 01:40:22.108
Well, thank you.

01:40:22.110 --> 01:40:25.107
I think I just might
have to take you up on that.

01:40:27.275 --> 01:40:28.809
Are you okay?

01:40:28.811 --> 01:40:30.341
What happened to you?

01:40:30.343 --> 01:40:32.809
Just a little accident.

01:40:33.976 --> 01:40:37.210
(Snaps fingers) Ladies,
I've been looking for you.

01:40:37.212 --> 01:40:39.274
Why don't you go and get in the van?

01:40:42.175 --> 01:40:45.275
Don't worry.
You can ride up front.

01:40:55.609 --> 01:40:57.476
(Latex glove snaps)

01:41:09.245 --> 01:41:12.612
What do you mean
you ain't never ate a tater tot?

01:41:12.614 --> 01:41:14.814
Johnson: I don't believe in them.

01:41:14.816 --> 01:41:16.447
Believe in them...

01:41:16.449 --> 01:41:18.078
Christ's name.

01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:20.379
Some people don't believe in God
or the tooth fairy.

01:41:20.381 --> 01:41:23.081
You think you have the right to
dismiss the existence of tater tots.

01:41:23.083 --> 01:41:26.614
Every freezer section, every grocery
across this nation has tater tots.

01:41:28.716 --> 01:41:33.446
I do not believe in eating
processed potatoes.

01:41:34.382 --> 01:41:36.781
Well, ain't that something?

01:41:36.783 --> 01:41:40.881
Sometimes you come in here
eating pickled pig's ass out of a jar.

01:41:40.883 --> 01:41:43.783
But now... now you too good for tater tots.

01:41:43.785 --> 01:41:46.280
- Now I've heard everything.
- Oh.

01:41:46.282 --> 01:41:48.714
You know what?

01:41:48.716 --> 01:41:50.948
Speaking of pickled pig's ass...

01:41:52.283 --> 01:41:54.048
I'd better be getting on home

01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:56.650
before my old lady get to raising sand.

01:41:57.751 --> 01:41:59.714
Go on, now.

01:41:59.716 --> 01:42:01.882
Okay, then.
I'll see you in the morning.

01:42:01.884 --> 01:42:03.783
God willing.

01:42:09.786 --> 01:42:12.250
(Doorbell chimes)

01:42:14.285 --> 01:42:15.552
- Hi there.
- How can I help you today?

01:42:15.554 --> 01:42:16.751
Hi. How can I help you?

01:42:16.753 --> 01:42:19.450
I'm just looking for a baseball bat.

01:42:19.452 --> 01:42:21.050
Yeah, I got one of them.

01:42:21.052 --> 01:42:22.984
I don't know.
It's here somewhere.

01:42:22.986 --> 01:42:24.784
I got one of them right here.

01:42:30.387 --> 01:42:32.152
That's the one I got.
It's the only one I got.

01:42:32.154 --> 01:42:33.719
Right there.
That'll be $7.

01:42:33.721 --> 01:42:36.653
Yeah?
This should work.

01:42:36.655 --> 01:42:38.751
- Yep.
- Yeah.

01:42:38.753 --> 01:42:41.718
- Take a look at my truck out there.
- Oh.

01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:44.388
You like it?

01:42:44.390 --> 01:42:46.321
Hey, whoa...

01:42:46.323 --> 01:42:48.055
You think you can just get rid of your car

01:42:48.057 --> 01:42:49.656
and I wouldn't be able to find ya?

01:42:49.658 --> 01:42:52.119
There's only, like, five people
in this whole town!

01:42:52.121 --> 01:42:54.452
- You got to understand something...
- (yells)

01:42:54.454 --> 01:42:56.453
Oh! Don't do that. Shit!

01:42:56.455 --> 01:42:59.719
- (Doorbell chimes)
- Nobody flips me...

01:42:59.721 --> 01:43:01.688
Get off!

01:43:04.224 --> 01:43:07.387
- Oh, shit! Ow.
- (Shovel clatters)

01:43:07.389 --> 01:43:08.921
- Shit.
- (Groaning)

01:43:08.923 --> 01:43:11.254
- Oh, you sick little midget.
- (Gun cocks)

01:43:11.256 --> 01:43:13.555
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Don't do it, Alton.

01:43:13.557 --> 01:43:17.557
- Hell, you...
- He ain't worth going to prison for.

01:43:18.756 --> 01:43:21.522
If I bury him deep enough,
nobody will know better.

01:43:21.524 --> 01:43:24.590
Come on, man.
Ain't you never seen "Forensics Files"?

01:43:24.592 --> 01:43:27.458
They can find molecules of your ass hair

01:43:27.460 --> 01:43:29.991
and poop on stuff
I ain't even heard of before.

01:43:29.993 --> 01:43:31.524
- What the hell are you talking about?
- I don't know.

01:43:31.525 --> 01:43:33.591
I just know that they always find the killer.

01:43:33.593 --> 01:43:35.959
Don't do it.
Come on.

01:43:37.460 --> 01:43:39.625
You get your ass outta here.

01:43:39.627 --> 01:43:40.858
All right?

01:43:40.860 --> 01:43:43.459
Unless you got a piece
of yellow brick road to pawn,

01:43:43.461 --> 01:43:45.125
don't you come back around here again.

01:43:48.793 --> 01:43:50.527
Fine.

01:43:50.529 --> 01:43:53.193
I'm three weeks late for a
business meeting in Atlanta

01:43:53.195 --> 01:43:54.960
because of you anyway.

01:43:54.963 --> 01:43:56.627
(Yells)

01:43:56.629 --> 01:43:59.324
(doorbell chimes)

01:44:01.093 --> 01:44:03.892
- Oh, Jesus.
- Damn.

01:44:03.894 --> 01:44:06.293
What in the hell was that about?

01:44:06.295 --> 01:44:08.361
It's a long story.

01:44:08.363 --> 01:44:10.062
I gave him the finger.

01:44:10.064 --> 01:44:12.726
He's been stalking me ever since.

01:44:12.728 --> 01:44:14.861
Well, I guess it's a short story.

01:44:14.863 --> 01:44:16.626
- Shit.
- (Death metal music playing)

01:44:16.628 --> 01:44:19.461
Hey, how much you give me on this?

01:44:21.328 --> 01:44:23.830
Uh... let me see.

01:44:27.530 --> 01:44:29.129
I'll give you 40.

01:44:29.131 --> 01:44:30.896
Sold.

01:44:30.898 --> 01:44:32.395

where'd these stanky ladies
in the flags come from?

They smell like something that done
flew out of a defecation device.

01:47:23.778 --> 01:47:25.809
I thought they were with your show.

01:47:25.811 --> 01:47:28.411

someone yawned in Technicolor.

01:47:37.746 --> 01:47:39.478
- I've got a question to ask you.
- Yes, sir.

01:47:39.480 --> 01:47:41.810
Why are all these naked ladies
wearing flags

01:47:41.812 --> 01:47:43.312
and why do they smell like doody?

01:47:43.314 --> 01:47:45.246

- let's dial it back.
- Man: Wow.

Fuck.
I'm sorry I lost it.

01:49:00.287 --> 01:49:01.552
