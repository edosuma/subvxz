every now and then,

01:11.295 --> 01:14.796
an animal is born with
a really special quality.

01:14.798 --> 01:18.767
A rare trait that sets him
apart from all the others.

01:18.769 --> 01:20.568
Wherever there is trouble,

01:20.570 --> 01:22.970
whenever there is
someone in need,

01:22.972 --> 01:26.541
where danger lurks
and mysteries abound...

01:26.543 --> 01:32.483
there is oink,
the flying pig!

01:41.558 --> 01:45.294
Hey, oink, oink,
is that really you?

01:45.296 --> 01:47.928
The famous flying pig?

01:47.930 --> 01:50.032
How many flying pigs
do you know?

01:50.034 --> 01:52.701
[Laughing]
'course it's you.

01:52.703 --> 01:54.903
Heard there was a porker
of a problem,

01:54.905 --> 01:58.874
a pig sty of a mystery, a hog
of a dilemma that needs solving.

01:58.876 --> 02:01.642
Indeed there is.
Hay!

02:01.644 --> 02:03.011
Hey to you,
little squirrel.

02:03.013 --> 02:05.946
No, no, no.
Not hey as in hello.

02:05.948 --> 02:09.351
I mean, hay, the kind
of farm animals eat.

02:09.353 --> 02:11.820
It's all over the grapevine.

02:11.822 --> 02:14.022
Or should i say the corn fields?

02:14.024 --> 02:17.893
All the animals are talking
about it, yelling about it.

02:17.895 --> 02:20.028
Farmer joe's hay's
gone missing

02:20.030 --> 02:22.864
and everybody is wondering
what happened to it.

02:22.866 --> 02:24.799
Missing hay, you say?

02:24.801 --> 02:28.737
Last night a big ol' bale
of hay disappeared.

02:28.739 --> 02:31.639
Farmer joe is so mad.

02:31.641 --> 02:33.941
He said he might have
to cut food rations

02:33.943 --> 02:35.876
for all the farm animals.

02:35.878 --> 02:39.413
I'm sure nobody's none
too pleased about that.

02:39.415 --> 02:42.784
Say, do squirrels
like you eat hay?

02:42.786 --> 02:45.686
Sure do.
It's delicious.

02:45.688 --> 02:47.722
But i eat lots of other things,

02:47.724 --> 02:51.560
nut seeds, insects, mushrooms,
fruit... even tree bark.

02:51.562 --> 02:55.096
And of course
i love a good acorn.

02:55.098 --> 02:58.632
- Tree bark?
- Tree bark, indeed.

02:58.634 --> 02:59.900
Well, i guess i've heard

02:59.902 --> 03:02.571
of stranger things
animals will eat,

03:02.573 --> 03:05.573
but let's go back
to the missing hay.

03:05.575 --> 03:10.811
This mystery sounds just up
my alley. Any suspects?

03:10.813 --> 03:14.683
It's gotta be one of them
farm animals for sure.

03:14.685 --> 03:16.685
But farmer joe
don't know who.

03:16.687 --> 03:18.919
No one's talking about it.

03:18.921 --> 03:22.858
Too many suspects
and not enough clues.

03:22.860 --> 03:26.794
I tell you, oink. Only you can
get to the bottom of this.

03:26.796 --> 03:28.630
We need your help.

03:28.632 --> 03:32.167
[Oinking]
this farm drama has everything.

03:32.169 --> 03:35.870
Intrigue, crime, mystery,

03:35.872 --> 03:39.441
and a farm full of suspects.

03:39.443 --> 03:40.574
I'm off to investigate.

03:40.576 --> 03:41.910
I will find the culprit

03:41.912 --> 03:46.617
or my name isn't
oink the flying pig.

03:47.784 --> 03:49.817
- Wait.
- What is it, slinky?

03:49.819 --> 03:51.987
I'm in a hurry to get
this crime solved.

03:51.989 --> 03:54.790
I was told
to give you a clue.

03:54.792 --> 03:56.191
A clue?

03:56.193 --> 03:57.925
I love clues.

03:57.927 --> 04:02.464
Big ears. I heard
the hay thief has big ears.

04:02.466 --> 04:05.733
H mm... lots of animals
have big years.

04:05.735 --> 04:07.735
I don't have big ears.

04:07.737 --> 04:09.571
But i'll tell you who does.

04:09.573 --> 04:13.041
Donkeys.
I'd go see them first.

04:13.043 --> 04:15.109
Thanks and goodbye, slinky.

04:15.111 --> 04:18.014
I'm off to discover the
whereabouts of the missing hay.

04:21.752 --> 04:25.986
Aye-ho, aye-ho,
all helping hands on deck.

a mystery solving adventure.

04:30.461 --> 04:31.662
Zoo ks.

04:34.865 --> 04:37.899
Zoo ks. I think slinky, the
squirrel, is up to something.

04:37.901 --> 04:39.767
I'd better follow oink, the flying pig.
He needs my help.

04:57.887 --> 05:00.154
Oink, i didn't hear
you coming.

05:00.156 --> 05:03.892
Hoot, hoot, that's
because i'm a farm owl.

05:03.894 --> 05:07.762
My feathers are especially
designed for silent flight.

05:07.764 --> 05:10.598
My wings are a unique
shape and size

05:10.600 --> 05:13.101
which allows me
to sneak up on prey.

05:13.103 --> 05:16.137
That's why i'm known
as the perfect hunter.

05:16.139 --> 05:18.906
I sure hope you didn't come
to eat me, my friend.

05:18.908 --> 05:22.510
- [Gasping]
- hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo!

05:22.512 --> 05:25.647
I don't eat pigs.
I eat small mammals.

05:25.649 --> 05:28.649
I am what it's called
nocturnal.

05:28.651 --> 05:30.017
Which means i hunt at night.

05:30.019 --> 05:31.652
But now it's day.

05:31.654 --> 05:34.656
And i'm not here to eat.
I'm here to help.

05:34.658 --> 05:37.058
I heard about farmer joe's
missing hay.

05:37.060 --> 05:39.894
[Oinking]
news travels fast.

05:39.896 --> 05:41.663
Owls don't have
very good eyesight,

05:41.665 --> 05:45.132
but we make up for it
by having excellent hearing.

05:45.134 --> 05:47.202
Nothing happens
for miles around here

05:47.204 --> 05:49.570
without me hearing
about it first.

05:49.572 --> 05:51.639
Great. I can use your help.

05:51.641 --> 05:53.675
I think this missing hay
is going to be

05:53.677 --> 05:56.077
a very hard mystery
to solve.

05:56.079 --> 05:59.548
Do you have any clues?
Any suspects?

05:59.550 --> 06:03.685
Slinky, the squirrel said
he heard the thief had big ears.

06:03.687 --> 06:06.154
He said to talk to the donkeys.

06:06.156 --> 06:07.923
The donkeys?

06:07.925 --> 06:09.723
Could be hearsay.

06:09.725 --> 06:12.093
You know how squirrels
can be sometimes.

06:12.095 --> 06:15.096
What do you know
about squirrels, b oink?

06:15.098 --> 06:19.767
Squirrels are very intelligent
and are also very cagey.

06:19.769 --> 06:23.337
Did you know that they bury
their food to throw off thieves?

06:23.339 --> 06:26.207
They're actually part
of the rodent family.

06:26.209 --> 06:29.777
Slinky is a boy squirrel,
and he's called a boar.

06:29.779 --> 06:32.180
Girls squirrels are called sows.

06:32.182 --> 06:34.983
- Just like pigs.
- That's right.

06:34.985 --> 06:38.687
Well, we must
investigate every clue.

06:38.689 --> 06:43.158
You're an animal expert
with a degree in farmology.

06:43.160 --> 06:45.026
Totally correct.

06:45.028 --> 06:48.163
Not a coincidence
they call me a barn owl.

06:48.165 --> 06:52.300
I live in the upper story of the cutest
little red barn on the pose y farm.

06:52.302 --> 06:54.235
And i've had time to learn
everything there is to know

06:54.237 --> 06:56.171
about farm animals.

06:56.173 --> 07:01.843
I'm lucky to have you with me.
What do you know about donkeys?

07:01.845 --> 07:04.913
I know donkeys are related
to horses and zebras

07:04.915 --> 07:07.848
and they have very long ears.

07:07.850 --> 07:10.084
Do they like to eat hay?

07:10.086 --> 07:12.353
They most certainly do.

07:12.355 --> 07:15.156
But they also eat
other grains and grasses.

07:15.158 --> 07:18.860
Slinky thinks donkeys
are suspicious creatures.

07:18.862 --> 07:23.264
Always laughing, "hee-ha,
hee-ha." [Laughing]

07:23.266 --> 07:24.865
that's called braying.

07:24.867 --> 07:27.235
Did you know a male donkey
is called a jack?

07:27.237 --> 07:29.370
A girl donkey is called
a jenny.

07:29.372 --> 07:32.139
And a young donkey
is called a foal.

07:32.141 --> 07:33.774
The same as a horse.

07:33.776 --> 07:36.144
Yes, the donkey is a member
of the horse family.

07:36.146 --> 07:39.680
Like horses,
they're very hard workers.

07:39.682 --> 07:42.716
They were domesticated
over 5,000 years ago.

07:42.718 --> 07:45.887
What does domesticated mean?

07:45.889 --> 07:48.288
It refers to an animal
tamed by people

07:48.290 --> 07:51.058
to keep as a pet
or to work on a farm.

07:51.060 --> 07:52.362
There's a donkey now.

in my life, but gosh darn!

08:13.050 --> 08:15.817

08:15.819 --> 08:17.284
That's me.

08:17.286 --> 08:20.221
Oink the flying pig.
But i don't just fly.

08:20.223 --> 08:22.856
I use my brain to solve
mysteries.

08:22.858 --> 08:24.892
You don't say.

08:24.894 --> 08:27.361
Where were you last night?

08:27.363 --> 08:29.397
Hee-ah!
Hee-ah!

08:29.399 --> 08:31.298
Oh, let's see.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.400
I was right here on the farm.

08:33.403 --> 08:34.934
Where else would i be?

08:34.937 --> 08:37.705
Over by the barn eating hay?

08:37.707 --> 08:41.075
I do love to munch
a bunch of hay.

08:41.077 --> 08:45.714
But truth be told,
i like straw even better.

08:45.716 --> 08:46.848
Aren't they the same?

08:46.850 --> 08:48.348
Hee-hee-hee.

08:48.350 --> 08:50.218
No, not at all.

08:50.220 --> 08:52.219
Straw is quite dry.

08:52.221 --> 08:54.488
A by-product composed
of plants,

08:54.490 --> 08:56.925
like oats, wheat, and barley.

08:56.927 --> 08:59.761
Hay is green, moister,

08:59.763 --> 09:04.265
and composed of legumes like
alfalfa, clover, and grasses.

09:04.267 --> 09:08.002
[Brays]
that's one smart owl.

09:08.004 --> 09:11.305
But why are you asking
all these questions?

09:11.307 --> 09:15.075
Someone stole
farmer joe's hay.

09:15.077 --> 09:17.244
Oh, you don't say.

09:17.246 --> 09:18.979
Wait a sec.

09:18.981 --> 09:21.418
I did hear some thin' 'bout that.
Let me think.

09:23.787 --> 09:27.488
Oh yeah, i... i heard
the thief had hooves.

09:27.490 --> 09:29.089
Hee-ha!

09:29.091 --> 09:30.925
You have hooves.

09:30.927 --> 09:32.359
So do you.

09:32.361 --> 09:34.262
Here's a riddle:

09:34.264 --> 09:39.334
what has four hooves
and loves hay?

09:39.336 --> 09:41.035
Your cousin, the horse?

09:41.037 --> 09:46.940
Hee-ah. Gosh, darn!
Smartest owl i ever did see.

09:46.942 --> 09:49.978
That's the answer... horses.

09:49.980 --> 09:52.416
Yep, that's who you
should be talking to.

09:53.850 --> 09:55.550
Horses, you say.

09:55.552 --> 09:58.920
I'm on my way.
But... don't go anywhere.

09:58.922 --> 10:01.823
I might need
to question you again.

10:01.825 --> 10:04.993
Zoo ks. Buzzing around,
i buzz-see,

10:04.995 --> 10:06.730

10:08.831 --> 10:10.366
[Music playing]

10:19.075 --> 10:21.508
what can you tell me
about horses?

10:21.510 --> 10:25.213
I know horses have been living
on farms for a long time.

10:25.215 --> 10:28.081
They were domesticated
over 5,000 years ago.

10:28.083 --> 10:30.118
Like their donkey cousins.

10:30.120 --> 10:31.886
Exactly.

10:31.888 --> 10:34.222
But farmers love
horses even more.

10:34.224 --> 10:36.991
They sit on their backs
and ride them.

10:36.993 --> 10:39.893
It's a lot faster than
walking around the farm.

10:39.895 --> 10:42.095
Makes a whole lot of sense.

10:42.097 --> 10:44.331
Horses also work on the farm.

10:44.333 --> 10:47.134
They plough fields
and pull wagons.

10:47.136 --> 10:51.372
And because they're old timers
they're quite friendly.

10:51.374 --> 10:53.574
Do you know what they call
a male horse?

10:53.576 --> 10:55.142
A stallion.

10:55.144 --> 10:57.311
A female horse
is called a mare.

10:57.313 --> 11:00.047
And see the little one,
he's called the colt.

11:00.049 --> 11:02.382
Or sometimes
you can call it a foal.

11:02.384 --> 11:04.285
That gets confusing.
[Oinking]

11:04.287 --> 11:06.521
there's a lot
to learn about horses.

11:06.523 --> 11:09.223
I know horses are very social.

11:09.225 --> 11:12.960
Oh, yes, they live together
in groups of three to twenty.

11:12.962 --> 11:15.296
A group of horses
is called a herd.

11:15.298 --> 11:20.334
Ah-ha! 20 horses.
That's a lot of mouths to feed.

11:20.336 --> 11:22.936
Hey, b oink,
maybe that's a clue.

11:22.938 --> 11:25.006
Maybe they took the hay.

11:25.008 --> 11:28.041
Did you know they can run
at four different speeds?

11:28.043 --> 11:29.544
That's a lot of options.

11:29.546 --> 11:32.280
They're called gaits.

11:32.282 --> 11:34.214
That's a fancy word.

11:34.216 --> 11:36.150
Tell me more about these gaits.

11:36.152 --> 11:39.420
When a horse is moving slowly,
it's called walking.

11:39.422 --> 11:41.055
Easy enough, right?

11:41.057 --> 11:43.557
When they pick up speed,
it's called a trot.

11:43.559 --> 11:47.027
A little faster,
that's called a canter.

11:47.029 --> 11:49.631
And the name for a horse's
fastest speed, a gallop.

11:49.633 --> 11:50.968
[Horse whinnies]

12:01.443 --> 12:05.079
hello, there, i'm oink,

12:05.081 --> 12:06.915
I'm jenny, the flying horse.

12:06.917 --> 12:10.251
I heard you were looking for me
so i came to meet you up here.

12:10.253 --> 12:11.986
Oh, isn't that nice of you?

12:11.988 --> 12:13.488
I'd say so.

12:13.490 --> 12:15.455
I was in the middle
of my meal, too.

12:15.457 --> 12:18.158
But anything to meet
the famous oink.

12:18.160 --> 12:20.127
Meal? You don't say.

12:20.129 --> 12:22.463
Well, horses are herbivores.

12:22.465 --> 12:24.632
Which means out food
comes from plants.

12:24.634 --> 12:27.068
But we also love treats.

12:27.070 --> 12:30.438
Like apples and yams
and other sweet things.

12:30.440 --> 12:33.340
All this talk of food
is making me hungry.

12:33.342 --> 12:36.411
We need to solve
this mystery fast.

12:36.413 --> 12:38.278
Did you say a mystery?

12:38.280 --> 12:40.381
I love a good mystery.

12:40.383 --> 12:43.450
I'm investigating the mystery
of the missing hay.

12:43.452 --> 12:45.453
Ne-e-e-e-i-g-h!

12:45.455 --> 12:48.323
Any suspects?
Any clues?

12:48.325 --> 12:52.126
You don't think we horses had
anything to do with it, do ya?

12:52.128 --> 12:54.329
Do you like hay?

12:54.331 --> 12:57.431
- I love it.
- A-ha!

12:57.433 --> 13:00.734
And with so many horses
in your herd,

13:00.736 --> 13:03.103
did you take
farmer joe's hay?

13:03.105 --> 13:06.174
Neigh! No!

13:06.176 --> 13:09.576
Couldn't be me. I was in
my stall when it happened.

13:09.578 --> 13:12.714
Farmer joe puts me
to bed before sun down.

13:12.716 --> 13:16.150
That's right. Horses sleep
in a barn on a farm.

13:16.152 --> 13:18.353
Sometimes they even sleep
standing up.

13:18.355 --> 13:19.988
You sleep standing up?

13:19.990 --> 13:21.756
You have big eyes.

13:21.758 --> 13:23.491
Did you see anything?

13:23.493 --> 13:26.694
We're looking for an animal
with big ears and hooves

13:26.696 --> 13:28.496
that loves to eat hay.

13:28.498 --> 13:31.431
I didn't see anything,
but i have a clue.

13:31.433 --> 13:36.036
Neigh, all good mysteries
have lots of clues.

13:36.038 --> 13:38.739
Yes, i'd love another clue.

13:38.741 --> 13:41.074
I heard the hay thief
had horns.

13:41.076 --> 13:42.743
Two horns to be exact.

13:42.745 --> 13:44.679
Horns, you say.

13:44.681 --> 13:48.248
Now, if i were looking for a
hay thief, i'd go see the goats.

13:48.250 --> 13:49.517
They have hooves,

13:49.519 --> 13:52.387
two horns,
and some of them dairy goats

13:52.389 --> 13:55.623
have mighty big floppy ears.

13:55.625 --> 13:57.358
Goats, you say.

13:57.360 --> 14:00.361
Neigh.
That is correct.

14:00.363 --> 14:03.765
Goats eat cloves, rope,
bark, you name it.

14:03.767 --> 14:06.033
They'll eat anything
that can run away.

14:06.035 --> 14:08.636
And i'll give you
another clue.

14:08.638 --> 14:12.739
Whoever took that bale of hay
eats a lot.

14:12.741 --> 14:16.044
That's a mighty big bunch of hay.
Neigh.

14:16.046 --> 14:18.046
The horse has a point.

14:18.048 --> 14:23.050
Round bales of hay can weigh
anywhere from 500 to 2,500 pounds.

14:23.052 --> 14:25.286
That is a lot of food.

14:25.288 --> 14:27.254
[Laughing]

14:27.256 --> 14:29.089
okay, okay.
[Oinking]

14:29.091 --> 14:30.657
no need to neigh.

14:30.659 --> 14:34.161
I'm off to find
that bale of hay.

14:34.163 --> 14:38.498
But don't go anywhere. I might
need to talk to you again.

14:38.500 --> 14:40.100
I'll see you guys around.

14:40.102 --> 14:41.435
Woo-hoo!

14:41.437 --> 14:42.837
I'm off to the farm.

14:42.839 --> 14:45.440
A pile of delicious
apples awaits.

14:45.442 --> 14:47.574
We're getting a lot
of suspects, b oink,

14:47.576 --> 14:51.514
but not much closer to
discovering who stole that hay.

14:53.549 --> 14:57.186
[Music playing]

15:04.760 --> 15:07.395
h mm, what do you know
about goats?

15:07.397 --> 15:10.330
I know the goat was one
of the first animals

15:10.332 --> 15:13.868
to be domesticated by people
over 9,000 years ago.

15:13.870 --> 15:15.770
That's longer than horses.

15:15.772 --> 15:18.305
Yes, they've been living
amongst people

15:18.307 --> 15:20.641
4,000 years longer than horses.

15:20.643 --> 15:24.545
9,000 years is a long time.

15:24.547 --> 15:27.147
It is. Did you know more
people in the world

15:27.149 --> 15:29.483
drank goat milk than
any other animal?

15:29.485 --> 15:32.252
I've never had goat milk.
What does it taste like?

15:32.254 --> 15:35.189
Ah... it depends on
what the goat eats.

15:35.191 --> 15:37.358
If the goat eats onions
or garlic,

15:37.360 --> 15:40.228
the flavor is different
than if it eats turnips.

15:40.230 --> 15:42.530
And if you think
there's only one type of goat,

15:42.532 --> 15:44.165
you'd be wrong.

15:44.167 --> 15:47.334
There are more than 300
different kinds of goats.

15:47.336 --> 15:50.271
What kind of goats live on
farmer joe's farms?

15:50.273 --> 15:54.407
Dairy goats, for one.
Goats are very sociable animals

15:54.409 --> 15:57.145
and will get depressed
if they don't have any friends.

15:57.147 --> 15:58.778
If someone has pet goats,

15:58.780 --> 16:01.648
they usually keep them
in small groups or pairs.

16:01.650 --> 16:03.718
What's a group of goats called?

16:03.720 --> 16:06.653
- A trip.
- A trip? [Gasping]

16:06.655 --> 16:08.823
now, that is a trip.

16:08.825 --> 16:10.458
Here are some funny facts.

16:10.460 --> 16:13.460
A female goat
is called a nanny.

16:13.462 --> 16:16.464
Male bucks are called
bucks or billies.

16:16.466 --> 16:18.632
A baby goat is called a kid.

16:18.634 --> 16:20.434
[Oink]
people call their children kids.

16:20.436 --> 16:24.272
[Oinking] wait, so was
billy the kid a goat?

16:24.274 --> 16:27.175
Ha-hoo! Ha-hoo!

16:27.177 --> 16:29.643
Hoot.
Now that would be a trip.

16:29.645 --> 16:32.747
Billy the kid was a famous
outlaw in the old west.

16:32.749 --> 16:35.682
But i do happen to know a kid
named billy the goat.

16:35.684 --> 16:38.953
Billy the kid.
Kid is billy the goat.

16:38.955 --> 16:40.921
Hoot-hoot.
Hoot-hoot.

16:40.923 --> 16:44.691
And unlike humans, kid goats
take their first steps

16:44.693 --> 16:46.459
within minutes of being born.

16:46.461 --> 16:49.597
And momma goats don't recognize
their kids by sight.

16:49.599 --> 16:52.599
Instead, each kid goat
has a unique smell

16:52.601 --> 16:55.203
and makes distinct
sounds called a bleat.

16:55.205 --> 16:58.805
Like pigs.
We have many sounds, too.

16:58.807 --> 17:01.242
We even have our own language.

17:01.244 --> 17:06.314
Piglish. Pigs can squeal,
snort, oink, or grunt. [Oink]

17:06.316 --> 17:08.548
woo-hoo! Woo-hoo!

17:08.550 --> 17:10.351
Here's another fun fact.

17:10.353 --> 17:12.853
Goats' eye pupils
are rectangular.

17:12.855 --> 17:14.854
What a funny shape
for a pupil.

17:14.856 --> 17:19.459
It is. But that gives them
vision up to 340 degrees.

17:19.461 --> 17:21.895
So they don't have to turn
their heads like humans,

17:21.896 --> 17:24.731
who can only see 210 degrees.

17:24.733 --> 17:28.669
Unlike humans, goats also
have great night vision.

17:28.671 --> 17:31.505
H mm, night vision, you say?

17:31.507 --> 17:35.742
That would come in mighty handy
to steal that bale of hay.

17:35.744 --> 17:39.380
Look, there's a trip
of goats right now.

17:39.382 --> 17:41.185
Let's find billy the goat
and see what he knows.

17:43.452 --> 17:45.719
[Music playing]

17:45.721 --> 17:47.688
are you billy the goat?

17:47.690 --> 17:48.889
Who's asking?

17:48.891 --> 17:50.458
Oink the flying pig.

17:50.460 --> 17:53.628
Ha-ha, pigs can't fly.
[Bleating]

17:53.630 --> 17:57.498
this one can.
He is a special pig.

17:57.500 --> 17:59.699
And you must be
a special goat.

17:59.701 --> 18:01.802
You have big floppy ears.

18:01.804 --> 18:04.904
I'm a regular old dairy goat.

18:04.906 --> 18:09.009
So tell me, why's
a flying pig visiting me?

18:09.011 --> 18:12.813
I'm investigating farmer joe's
missing hay.

18:12.815 --> 18:15.949
Missing hay, you say.
[Bleating]

18:15.951 --> 18:18.652
i don't like to hear about
missing hay.

18:18.654 --> 18:22.523
I instead, like to hear
about non-missing hay

18:22.525 --> 18:25.959
being eaten by me.
[Burps]

18:25.961 --> 18:27.061
what's that a burp?

18:27.063 --> 18:28.962
Ah-ha! [Oinking]

18:28.964 --> 18:34.334
are you burping because you just
ate farmer joe's bale of hay?

18:34.336 --> 18:38.072
Don't be ridiculous.
We goats burp a lot

18:38.074 --> 18:41.542
because we are what's called
ruminant animals.

18:41.544 --> 18:43.076
We have rumens.

18:43.078 --> 18:44.812
What's a rumen?

18:44.814 --> 18:47.948
The rumen is the first
part of my stomach.

18:47.950 --> 18:49.583
Everyone knows that.

18:49.585 --> 18:50.950
That's right.

18:50.952 --> 18:53.888
The rumen breaks down
cellulose in plants

18:53.890 --> 18:55.956
and acts
as a fermentation vat.

18:55.958 --> 18:57.892
Fermentation produces gas,

18:57.894 --> 19:00.694
and this gas escapes
a goat's body

19:00.696 --> 19:03.764
in the form
of many loud burps.

19:03.766 --> 19:06.400
How many stomachs do you have?

19:06.402 --> 19:08.902
What a ridiculous question.

19:08.904 --> 19:10.638
One, of course.

19:10.640 --> 19:14.642
One stomach with
four compartments.

19:14.644 --> 19:17.944
Interesting,
but not very helpful.

19:17.946 --> 19:20.014
But i am helpful.

19:20.016 --> 19:23.950
If you're looking for animals
that eat a whole lot of hay,

19:23.952 --> 19:26.019
talk to the sheep.
[Bleating]

19:26.021 --> 19:27.888
sheep eat hay?

19:27.890 --> 19:31.525
I believe they prefer clover
and other pasture plants.

19:31.527 --> 19:35.462
But when that's not available,
they'll happily eat hay.

19:35.464 --> 19:38.865
But do they have big ears?
Do they have horns?

19:38.867 --> 19:41.936
Who said anything about horns?

19:41.938 --> 19:45.605
Jenny horse said
the hay thief had horns.

19:45.607 --> 19:48.042
[Bleating]
i heard the hay thief

19:48.044 --> 19:52.513
was a ruminant
with a big wool y body.

19:52.515 --> 19:54.414
A big wool y body?

19:54.416 --> 19:58.753
[Bleating] the sheep. They'll
know about that missing hay.

19:58.755 --> 20:00.554
And you gotta find it

20:00.556 --> 20:03.423
'cause the last time
farmer joe had to ration hay,

20:03.425 --> 20:07.928
me and my goat family ate
farmer joe's clothes.

20:07.930 --> 20:10.831
They was delicious.

20:10.833 --> 20:13.836
But farmer joe's wife
was mighty mad.

20:18.074 --> 20:20.540
You can count on me
billy, the goat.

20:20.542 --> 20:22.442
I'm a great sleuth.

20:22.444 --> 20:24.111
A pig crime solver.

20:24.113 --> 20:25.048
I won't let you down.

20:28.483 --> 20:30.885
I am getting more and more
buzz-spicious.

20:34.957 --> 20:38.758
This mystery is getting
very confusing, b oink.

20:38.760 --> 20:40.193
Yes, it is.

20:40.195 --> 20:43.998
But you'll solve it,
oink, i know you will.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.433
What do you know
about sheep?

20:46.435 --> 20:48.902
I believe there's over one
billion of them in the world.

20:48.904 --> 20:51.071
One of them has
to know something.

20:51.073 --> 20:52.773
A billion?

20:52.775 --> 20:56.009
It would take forever
to talk to a billion sheep.

20:56.011 --> 20:59.447
Don't worry. They don't
all live on this farm.

20:59.449 --> 21:01.481
Sheep are everywhere.

21:01.483 --> 21:03.817
People find them soft
and cuddly.

21:03.819 --> 21:07.921
They even love their wool,
which is called fleece.

21:07.923 --> 21:11.825
One sheep can produce up to
30 pounds of wool every year.

21:11.827 --> 21:13.827
That's a lot of sweaters.

21:13.829 --> 21:16.596
Sheep are known
as gentle creatures.

21:16.598 --> 21:18.833
They're sweet, calm animals

21:18.835 --> 21:20.934
they stay close to each other.

21:20.936 --> 21:23.804
They live in large groups
for company and protection.

21:23.806 --> 21:27.641
- Groups of sheep are called...
- flocks, right? [Oinking]

21:27.643 --> 21:30.143
i know something
about sheep myself.

21:30.145 --> 21:34.047
Did you know a flock of sheep
is sometimes called a mob?

21:34.049 --> 21:36.150
That doesn't sound
very friendly.

21:36.152 --> 21:39.652
Did you know a sheep is called a
lamb until it's one year of age?

21:39.654 --> 21:44.024
If the lamb grows into a male
adult, it's called a ram.

21:44.026 --> 21:46.227
A female is called a ewe.

21:46.229 --> 21:48.828
Ewes are very caring moms.

21:48.830 --> 21:52.866
They can recognize the call of
their lamb from many miles away.

21:52.868 --> 21:55.102
And sheep make
the best friends.

21:55.104 --> 22:00.074
They are friendly with other
sheep, people, dogs, any animal.

22:00.076 --> 22:01.976
They're very loyal.

22:01.978 --> 22:06.279
Oh, look, there's one of my
friends. Berth a the sheep.

22:06.281 --> 22:08.148
[Sheep bleats]

22:08.150 --> 22:10.784
bah.
B oink, how are you?

22:10.786 --> 22:12.952
It's not like you
to be out in daylight.

22:12.954 --> 22:14.787
Are you enjoying
this beautiful day?

22:14.789 --> 22:19.626
I am. I'm here with my friend
oink the flying pig.

22:19.628 --> 22:22.930
We're investigating the mystery
of the missing hay.

22:22.932 --> 22:26.901
[Bleats] everyone at the
farm is talking about that.

22:26.903 --> 22:30.036
They say a pig is leading
the investigation.

22:30.038 --> 22:32.873
Bah.
Good to meet you.

22:32.875 --> 22:35.241
I see you have hooves.

22:35.243 --> 22:36.844
Yes, i do.

22:36.846 --> 22:41.248
I heard you are a pig
with super intelligence.

22:41.250 --> 22:43.616
Sheep are very
intelligent, too.

22:43.618 --> 22:47.220
We can solve problems at the
level of a three year-old child.

22:47.222 --> 22:49.023
Then maybe you can help.

22:49.025 --> 22:51.624
Have you seen
anybody suspicious

22:51.626 --> 22:54.061
around farmer joe's
bale of hay?

22:54.063 --> 22:57.030
I did see a human
of the small variety

22:57.032 --> 22:58.332
leaning against a bale of hay

22:58.334 --> 23:00.834
with some kind of
topping on his head.

23:00.836 --> 23:02.303
Like chocolate fudge?

23:02.305 --> 23:03.737
Whipped cream?

23:03.739 --> 23:05.905
I'm no swine nutritionist,

23:05.907 --> 23:08.842
but it sounds like
someone may be hungry.

23:08.844 --> 23:10.311
I can offer you a carrot.

23:10.313 --> 23:11.844
Sheep eat carrots?

23:11.846 --> 23:14.213
The farmer gives them
to me for treats.

23:14.215 --> 23:15.915
I'll take a rain check
on the carrot.

23:15.917 --> 23:17.985
But if you have some
chocolate pudding

23:17.987 --> 23:20.653
i can help myself to...
[laughing]

23:20.655 --> 23:21.654
sorry, none of that.

23:21.656 --> 23:23.123
That's quite all right.

23:23.125 --> 23:26.160
Maybe you can help us solve
this crime mystery.

23:26.162 --> 23:27.995
Can you tell us anything more

23:27.997 --> 23:31.632
about this human
with the head topping?

23:31.634 --> 23:35.702
I have good eye sight, but not
the best depth perception.

23:35.704 --> 23:38.639
However, i do have
a deep sense of smell.

23:38.641 --> 23:41.240
And i know the little human
was a new face on the farm

23:41.242 --> 23:44.277
because sheep have excellent
memories for faces.

23:44.279 --> 23:45.879
What a great skill.

23:45.881 --> 23:48.248
If you wanna know more
about the little human,

23:48.250 --> 23:50.249
i'd go see the chickens.

23:50.251 --> 23:53.219
They're always clucking
about them.

23:53.221 --> 23:55.055
[Bleats]

23:55.057 --> 23:58.191
[buzzing] berth a the sheep
offering oink a carrot.

23:58.193 --> 24:01.694
[Buzzing] why did she
have a carrot to give?

24:01.696 --> 24:04.097
Wasn't she hungry enough
to keep it for herself?

24:04.099 --> 24:07.700
Could it be she's full of hay?

24:07.702 --> 24:10.036
H mm-bzzz.

24:10.038 --> 24:11.974
This bee is buzz-spicious.

24:15.010 --> 24:19.412
Berth a, the sheep said chickens
are always clucking about humans.

24:19.414 --> 24:22.982
How long ago were chickens
domesticated, b oink?

24:22.984 --> 24:26.653
Chickens were domesticated
about 8,000 years ago.

24:26.655 --> 24:29.123
There are now more chickens
on earth than people.

24:29.125 --> 24:32.159
There are lots and lots of
different kinds of chickens too.

24:32.161 --> 24:37.197
One kind called silkies
has five toes on each foot.

24:37.199 --> 24:39.833
- Just like people.
- That's right.

24:39.835 --> 24:42.369
But a female chicken isn't
called a miss or a lady.

24:42.371 --> 24:44.103
She's called a hen.

24:44.105 --> 24:46.806
And a male chicken
is called a rooster.

24:46.808 --> 24:48.875
What are their babies called?

24:48.877 --> 24:51.879
Chicks. And there's lots
of chicks on the farm,

24:51.881 --> 24:55.748
'cause one hen can lay
more than 300 eggs in a year.

24:55.750 --> 24:57.718
That's a lot of eggs.

24:57.720 --> 25:01.822
Question: what makes a hen
decide to lay eggs?

25:01.824 --> 25:05.459
Answer: the amount of light
she's exposed to.

25:05.461 --> 25:08.128
Sounds like they're
very smart animals.

25:08.130 --> 25:09.796
They're not only smart.

25:09.798 --> 25:11.899
They make excellent teachers.

25:11.901 --> 25:13.967
Mother hens teach their babies

25:13.969 --> 25:18.138
to recognize colors and shapes
of foods which are good to eat

25:18.140 --> 25:20.908
and conversely
those which are not.

25:20.910 --> 25:22.308
How does she do that?

25:22.310 --> 25:25.112
Mother hen starts
her lessons very early

25:25.114 --> 25:27.448
when the chicks
are still in the egg.

25:27.450 --> 25:30.150
They talk to their chick
before they even hatch.

25:30.152 --> 25:33.786
Like pre-pre-school?
But do they have a good memory?

25:33.788 --> 25:35.389
Will they be able to tell us

25:35.391 --> 25:39.159
whether they have seen a new
human face around the farm?

25:39.161 --> 25:41.461
Yes, chickens
have a great memory.

25:41.463 --> 25:46.467
They can distinguish between over 100
different faces of people or animals.

25:46.469 --> 25:48.434
That's amazing.

25:48.436 --> 25:51.939
People think that they're just
silly creatures that lay eggs.

25:51.941 --> 25:54.775
But you know the most amazing
thing about chickens,

25:54.777 --> 25:58.211
their ancestors were
the mighty dinosaurs.

25:58.213 --> 26:00.213
Wow, dinosaurs?

26:00.215 --> 26:02.449
I'm glad they're not
that big anymore.

26:02.451 --> 26:03.883
There's one of them now.

26:03.885 --> 26:07.254
[Clucks]

26:07.256 --> 26:11.225
ah, rita, the hen, it's you.
Nice of you to join us.

26:11.227 --> 26:14.026
I'm oink, the flying pig.

26:14.028 --> 26:17.898
I'm investigating the mystery
of the missing hay.

26:17.900 --> 26:20.133
Berth a the sheep thought
you could help me.

26:20.135 --> 26:25.171
[Clucking]

26:25.173 --> 26:27.474
what is she saying?

26:27.476 --> 26:29.176
She's speaking chicken.

26:29.178 --> 26:31.879
Did you know chickens
have their own language?

26:31.881 --> 26:35.315
Each sound they make means
something specific.

26:35.317 --> 26:37.284
Just like the human language.

26:37.286 --> 26:41.822
- I don't speak chicken.
- [Clucking]

26:41.824 --> 26:44.093
i do.
A little.

26:45.124 --> 26:47.561
I am semi-fluent
in over 30 animal tongues.

26:47.563 --> 26:50.863
Rita was just offering us
a salty candy.

26:50.865 --> 26:53.866
A salty candy?
You mean a sweet candy.

26:53.868 --> 26:56.303
No, chickens can't
taste sweetness,

26:56.305 --> 26:59.006
but they can taste saltiness.

26:59.008 --> 27:01.341
Uh, [oinking]
maybe next time, rita.

27:01.343 --> 27:05.011
Salty candy... ew!

27:05.013 --> 27:06.446
Cluck, cluck, cluck,

27:06.448 --> 27:09.082
i heard you are looking
for farmer joe's hay.

27:09.084 --> 27:10.883
Can you help us?

27:10.885 --> 27:13.821
I came to tell ya there was
a boy near the bale of hay.

27:13.823 --> 27:15.055
He was sitting on it.

27:15.057 --> 27:17.423
Yes, berth a the sheep
saw him, too.

27:17.425 --> 27:19.927
Did he have a topper
on his head?

27:19.929 --> 27:23.831
A topper? Cluck, cluck.
Do you mean a hat?

27:23.833 --> 27:25.298
Humans wear head toppers

27:25.300 --> 27:28.267
to protect their fragile heads
from the sun.

27:28.269 --> 27:31.171
They put little caps right on
top of that stuff they call...

27:31.173 --> 27:32.605
hair.

27:32.607 --> 27:36.043
I've seen head toppers
in all shapes and sizes.

27:36.045 --> 27:38.444
Very interesting.

27:38.446 --> 27:42.149
This definitely seems
to be a clue worth pursuing.

27:42.151 --> 27:43.984
But i still need
to ask you this.

27:43.986 --> 27:46.286
Do you eat hay?

27:46.288 --> 27:49.189
Me? Oh, no.

27:49.191 --> 27:52.124
I might pick a seed or two
off the top of the hay

27:52.126 --> 27:56.263
if i'm bored, but it's certainly
not my favorite food.

27:56.265 --> 27:58.966
I see, what about hooves?

27:58.968 --> 28:01.101
Do you have hooves?

28:01.103 --> 28:03.903
Cluck! Don't be ridiculous.

28:03.905 --> 28:07.574
Chickens have, well,
chicken feet with claws.

28:07.576 --> 28:10.043
Guess that rules you out
as a suspect.

28:10.045 --> 28:11.344
That's for sure,

28:11.346 --> 28:14.046
if a pile of worms
ever goes missing,

28:14.048 --> 28:16.216
you come and see me then.
[Laughing]

28:16.218 --> 28:18.317
but hay, no way.

28:18.319 --> 28:19.620
Cluck, cluck.

28:19.622 --> 28:21.587
But i might have a clue for you.

28:21.589 --> 28:23.123
A clue?

28:23.125 --> 28:25.025
I love clues.

28:25.027 --> 28:28.461
I saw a little human
walk off towards the hogs.

28:28.463 --> 28:31.030
And you can trust me on that.

28:31.032 --> 28:32.532
I have great eyesight.

28:32.534 --> 28:33.535
I don't miss a thing.

28:35.637 --> 28:39.573
This mystery is getting
more and more complicated.

28:39.575 --> 28:43.576
Maybe my cousin, nog the hog
can help us solve it.

28:43.578 --> 28:46.479
Well, oink the flying pig,

28:46.481 --> 28:49.615
i certainly don't have to tell
you about pigs and hogs

28:49.617 --> 28:51.218
that live on a farm.

28:51.220 --> 28:53.186
[Oinking]
you sure don't, b oink.

28:53.188 --> 28:54.988
It's my turn to teach you.

28:54.990 --> 28:58.491
I can tell you that pigs are
highly intelligent animals.

28:58.493 --> 29:02.629
They can be taught tricks and
walk on a leash just like a dog.

29:02.631 --> 29:04.398
Pigs are cool.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.933
Some people
even keep us as pets.

29:06.935 --> 29:11.037
There are so many stories about
pigs that saved human lives.

29:11.039 --> 29:13.606
Why, one of my closest
relatives named who

29:13.608 --> 29:16.476
once pulled her owner
out of a muddy bog.

29:16.478 --> 29:18.679
Another pig relative
of mine, priscilla,

29:18.681 --> 29:21.113
saved a young boy
from drowning.

29:21.115 --> 29:23.249
You are mighty
impressive animals.

29:23.251 --> 29:25.151
Tell me more.

29:25.153 --> 29:28.055
Pigs live in close-knit
groups called sounders.

29:28.057 --> 29:32.692
Sounders are formed by one male,
many females and their young.

29:32.694 --> 29:37.163
A baby pig is called a piglet
and his momma is called a sow.

29:37.165 --> 29:39.498
And daddy pig is called a boar.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.334
What else can you tell me?

29:41.336 --> 29:45.205
Wild pigs can give birth to
as many as 14 babies at once.

29:45.207 --> 29:47.039
That's one busy mom.

29:47.041 --> 29:50.076
Domestic pigs have
funny-looking curly tails,

29:50.078 --> 29:52.278
but wild pigs have
straight tails.

29:52.280 --> 29:55.181
Pigs have an excellent
sense of smell.

29:55.183 --> 29:59.018
You see the large round disk of
cartilage at the tip of my nose?

29:59.020 --> 30:02.622
My snout is connected to muscle
that gives it extra flexibility

30:02.624 --> 30:04.524
and strength
for sniffing around.

30:04.526 --> 30:09.129
That's why i am so good
at sniffing out the truth.

30:09.131 --> 30:13.132
Pigs are omnivores which means
we eat both plants and meat.

30:13.134 --> 30:15.568
So you can offer me
any type of healthy treat

30:15.570 --> 30:17.571
and i will happily accept.

30:17.573 --> 30:19.105
Like a carrot.

30:19.107 --> 30:20.640
Yes, well, [laughing]
[oinking]

30:20.642 --> 30:25.045
i do prefer a whole apple pie
to a carrot...

30:25.047 --> 30:28.582
but a carrot will do.

30:28.584 --> 30:32.719
Like all the farm animals,
i do love to eat.

30:32.721 --> 30:35.389
What's the difference between
you and your cousin, the hog?

30:35.391 --> 30:36.757
Mmm, not much, really.

30:36.759 --> 30:40.192
Mainly size and age,
but, like all animals,

30:40.194 --> 30:42.228
when you start looking
into specifics,

30:42.230 --> 30:45.265
you could fill
a swine dictionary.

30:45.267 --> 30:48.535
There are words referring
to our size or maturity:

30:48.537 --> 30:52.572
there are pigs, hogs,
boars, sows,

30:52.574 --> 30:57.143
wieners, feeders, shoats,
gilts, farrows, pigs.

30:57.145 --> 31:00.649
Not to mention we have
our very own language, piglish.

31:06.255 --> 31:09.623
Nog, you're looking
nice and muddy.

31:09.625 --> 31:12.124
Just keeping cool.

31:12.126 --> 31:15.495
Some people think we roll around in
the mud because we're dirty animals

31:15.497 --> 31:17.530
who don't like to be clean.
H mm.

31:17.532 --> 31:20.534
Nonsense.
Anybody who knows anything

31:20.536 --> 31:23.536
knows pigs are very clean.

31:23.538 --> 31:27.707
We don't even like to go to the
bathroom where we sleep or eat.

31:27.709 --> 31:30.177
We only roll around
in the mud to keep cool

31:30.179 --> 31:34.213
because we do not have sweat
glands. Who doesn't know that?

31:34.215 --> 31:36.382
You're here to ask me
about the missing hay?

31:36.384 --> 31:38.651
[Squealing]
yes.

31:38.653 --> 31:40.420
I'm proud of you, cousin.

31:40.422 --> 31:44.458
Everybody knows pigs are curious
and insightful and smart.

31:44.460 --> 31:46.192
Not to toot our own trumpets,

31:46.194 --> 31:49.161
but we are the fourth smartest
animals on the planet

31:49.163 --> 31:52.199
after humans, primates,
and dolphins.

31:52.201 --> 31:54.301
And owls.

31:54.303 --> 31:56.803
Of course you, b oink,
and my cousin oink

31:56.805 --> 31:58.305
are the smartest of all.

31:58.307 --> 32:00.140
Your reputation as crime solvers

32:00.142 --> 32:02.174
is known throughout
the animal kingdom.

32:02.176 --> 32:05.747
[Grunting]

32:09.317 --> 32:13.385
mmm, i didn't quite
understand that conversation.

32:13.387 --> 32:15.588
What are you two
talking about?

32:15.590 --> 32:17.324
We're talking piglish.

32:17.326 --> 32:20.594
Each oink grunt and squeal
has its own meaning.

32:20.596 --> 32:26.232
For example, a short grunt
a longer growl and a loud roar

32:26.234 --> 32:30.170
will warn my pig friends
of approaching danger.

32:30.172 --> 32:33.776
[Oinking]

32:35.810 --> 32:37.611
[buzzing]

32:37.613 --> 32:38.548
ba-zoo ks.

32:39.714 --> 32:41.783
[Music playing]

32:44.752 --> 32:47.586
i didn't understand
all that piglish.

32:47.588 --> 32:50.556
Did nog the hog
have another clue?

32:50.558 --> 32:54.393
He did give me another clue.

32:54.395 --> 32:57.564
He said he saw
farmer joe's dog, to bias,

32:57.566 --> 33:01.668
sleeping by the bale of hay
right before it disappeared.

33:01.670 --> 33:04.804
Hoot, i might not know
a lot of piglish,

33:04.806 --> 33:07.507
but i do know
a lot about dogs.

33:07.509 --> 33:09.709
I know dogs bark
and make a fuss

33:09.711 --> 33:11.478
when anyone goes near
their human.

33:11.480 --> 33:12.912
That's right.

33:12.914 --> 33:15.882
Humans and dogs have been
friends for a long time.

33:15.884 --> 33:18.884
Over 14,000 years.

33:18.886 --> 33:21.688
Now that's
a lasting friendship.

33:21.690 --> 33:24.857
That's why they're called
men's best friend.

33:24.859 --> 33:29.763
And like us birds, there are
hundreds of different breeds.

33:29.765 --> 33:34.567
Let's see: there are bloodhounds,
chihuahuas, collies,

33:34.569 --> 33:37.770
golden retrievers,
germ an shepherds, rottweilers,

33:37.772 --> 33:42.342
bulldogs, yorkshires, poodles,
akitas, bichon f rise,

33:42.344 --> 33:44.611
terriers, chow-chows,
greyhounds...

33:44.613 --> 33:48.248
oh, i could go on and on.

33:48.250 --> 33:50.984
Don't some dogs work
on the farm as well?

33:50.986 --> 33:54.787
Sure, dog breeds
are divided into classes

33:54.789 --> 33:57.824
such as sporting, hound,
working, terrier,

33:57.826 --> 34:01.661
toy, non-sporting
and herding.

34:01.663 --> 34:04.597
Dogs help humans do things
including hunting,

34:04.599 --> 34:06.865
farm work and security,

34:06.867 --> 34:10.637
as well as assisting
those with disabilities.

34:10.639 --> 34:13.940
Did you know that there's a
dog-shaped building in new zeal and?

34:13.942 --> 34:16.809
They must really love
pups down there.

34:16.811 --> 34:18.378
All fun facts, b oink,

34:18.380 --> 34:20.380
but they don't help
us get any closer

34:20.382 --> 34:23.416
to find out who stole
farmer joe's hay.

34:23.418 --> 34:27.253
Well, dogs also have
an amazing sense of smell.

34:27.255 --> 34:30.523
If anyone can tell us
about what happened to the hay

34:30.525 --> 34:33.295
it's farmer joe's dog, to bias.

34:39.034 --> 34:43.503
[Growling]

34:43.505 --> 34:46.304
oink the pig
and b oink the barn owl.

34:46.306 --> 34:49.275
I could smell you coming
a mile away.

34:49.277 --> 34:51.043
Nice of you to come meet us.

34:51.045 --> 34:52.911
No problem.

34:52.914 --> 34:56.483
I like visitors.
It's such a hot day today.

34:56.485 --> 34:58.017
Don't you find?

34:58.019 --> 35:00.987
I'm panting and sweating,
panting and sweating.

35:00.989 --> 35:05.291
Sweating? You look mighty dry
for someone who is sweating.

35:05.293 --> 35:08.461
Oh, that's because,
unlike pigs and humans,

35:08.463 --> 35:10.030
who sweat from everywhere,

35:10.032 --> 35:13.666
we only sweat through
the pads of our paws.

35:13.668 --> 35:16.302
I see.
That's all?

35:16.304 --> 35:18.003
How do you stay cool
in this weather

35:18.005 --> 35:22.041
if you can only sweat
through the pads of your paws?

35:22.043 --> 35:26.612
Well, that's because we also
pant to cool ourselves off.

35:26.614 --> 35:28.782
That's a lot of panting.

35:28.784 --> 35:31.418
Oh, that's nothing.

35:31.420 --> 35:34.554
We're different
in other ways, too.

35:34.556 --> 35:37.356
For instance,
how many eyelids do i have?

35:37.358 --> 35:38.358
Take a guess.

35:38.360 --> 35:39.592
I don't know.

35:39.594 --> 35:41.360
One? Two?

35:41.362 --> 35:42.896
Three!

35:42.898 --> 35:47.032
An upper eyelid, a lower eyelid,
and a third eyelid.

35:47.034 --> 35:50.570
This third eyelid
is called a haw

35:50.572 --> 35:54.106
and helps keep my eye
moist and protected.

35:54.108 --> 35:56.775
That's truly remarkable.

35:56.777 --> 36:02.081
But tell me, have you heard
about the stolen hay?

36:02.083 --> 36:06.952
[Growling] of course. [Growling]
that's all anyone is talking about.

36:06.954 --> 36:11.724
I can tell you i was sleeping
right by the bale of hay.

36:11.726 --> 36:14.494
It smelled fresh
and delicious.

36:14.496 --> 36:17.963
Ah-ha, so delicious
you had to eat it?

36:17.965 --> 36:20.133
[Growling]
don't be ridiculous.

36:20.135 --> 36:21.967
Dogs don't eat hay.

36:21.969 --> 36:24.771
We are carnivores.

36:24.773 --> 36:28.141
But i can tell you
there was a boy sitting there.

36:28.143 --> 36:30.008
He was wearing a hat.

36:30.010 --> 36:33.079
And, i believe,
eating a sandwich.

36:33.081 --> 36:35.514
Roast beef on rye.

36:35.516 --> 36:40.519
If your eyes were closed and
you were sleeping, as you say,

36:40.521 --> 36:43.523
how do you know what
the boy was eating?

36:43.525 --> 36:48.595
[Growling] even if my eyes were
closed, my nostrils were not.

36:48.597 --> 36:50.996
Dogs have a remarkable
sense of smell.

36:50.998 --> 36:56.869
10,000 to 100,000 times more
powerful than that of humans.

36:56.871 --> 37:00.572
And look at my nose,
you see how wet it is?

37:00.574 --> 37:04.443
Well, that wetness is also
essential in determining

37:04.445 --> 37:08.014
what direction
a smell is coming from.

37:08.016 --> 37:10.083
For instance,
i can tell you

37:10.085 --> 37:13.052
that you just
came from the hogs.

37:13.054 --> 37:15.789
And before that
you saw the chickens.

37:15.791 --> 37:18.758
Before that the sheep,
and before that...

37:18.760 --> 37:20.427
remarkable!

37:20.429 --> 37:21.760
What else can you tell us?

37:21.762 --> 37:24.197
I can tell you
what i heard, too.

37:24.199 --> 37:28.967
Do you know i have more
than 18 muscles in my ears?

37:28.969 --> 37:31.704
A human only
has six muscles

37:31.706 --> 37:34.474
and can only move
their ears slightly.

37:34.476 --> 37:36.108
But when my ears perk up,

37:36.110 --> 37:39.077
i can move them
in the direction of a sound.

37:39.079 --> 37:43.016
That's how i know the boy walked
first towards the pig pen,

37:43.018 --> 37:46.686
then in that direction,
towards the main house.

37:46.688 --> 37:49.988
Farmer joe called him
to do his chores.

37:49.990 --> 37:53.693
Earlier when i was in the house
having breakfast with the family

37:53.695 --> 37:57.697
i heard farmer joe
call him his nephew.

37:57.699 --> 38:00.233
What is that?
Do they eat hay?

38:00.235 --> 38:02.735
Ever seen a human eat hay?

38:02.737 --> 38:04.704
I've seen them
sleep on hay.

38:04.706 --> 38:07.706
In fact, i've taken
a nap next to them.

38:07.708 --> 38:11.845
H mm. Quite comfortable hay,
[giggling] why once...

38:11.847 --> 38:15.815
we're kind of in a hurry.
We have a mystery to solve.

38:15.817 --> 38:18.784
[Growling]
of course.

38:18.786 --> 38:20.954
As i was saying,
i believe farmer joe

38:20.956 --> 38:23.923
called the small human
his nephew.

38:23.925 --> 38:27.927
A nephew.
Farmer joe's relative?

38:27.929 --> 38:29.929
[Oink]
what's a relative?

38:29.931 --> 38:31.831
Part of a human's family.

38:31.833 --> 38:34.233
His sister's son
to be exact.

38:34.235 --> 38:37.704
I so love clues!

38:37.706 --> 38:39.671
It's what helps me
solve a mystery.

38:39.673 --> 38:42.508
I have one more clue
to give you.

38:42.510 --> 38:43.809
When i woke up,

38:43.811 --> 38:45.778
quite late that afternoon,

38:45.780 --> 38:49.215
the missing bale of hay
was still there.

38:49.217 --> 38:51.851
I followed the boy to
the house to have dinner.

38:51.853 --> 38:54.586
Dinner?
That makes me hungry.

38:54.588 --> 38:55.954
What did you have for dinner?

38:55.956 --> 38:58.090
A delicious bowl
of crunchy nibbles.

38:58.092 --> 39:01.260
Hmmm,
i'd love some of that.

39:01.262 --> 39:03.195
It was so good.

39:03.197 --> 39:06.965
I ate it all and fell asleep
in front of farmer joe's feet.

39:06.967 --> 39:10.737
That sounds so nice...
but how is that a clue?

39:10.739 --> 39:12.204
You said you had a clue.

39:12.206 --> 39:14.574
Patience.
Let me finish.

39:14.576 --> 39:19.711
A while later, i woke up when farmer
joe and his wife went upstairs to bed.

39:19.713 --> 39:22.882
As i followed them,
they said goodnight to the boy,

39:22.884 --> 39:26.753
and i smelled
the strongest scent of milk.

39:26.755 --> 39:29.222
- Milk?
- Yes. I smelled milk.

39:29.224 --> 39:33.860
Delicious smell... [laughing]
impossible to forget.

39:33.862 --> 39:36.128
Milk? I'm thirsty.
[Laughing]

39:36.130 --> 39:38.597
[oinking]
i would love some of that milk,

39:38.599 --> 39:41.668
but how is that a clue?

39:41.670 --> 39:45.237
Boys drink milk. Maybe he drank
some milk before bed.

39:45.239 --> 39:48.041
Ah-ha! But along with
the scent of milk,

39:48.043 --> 39:51.644
i smelled cows and cats.

39:51.646 --> 39:53.079
Cows and cats?

39:53.081 --> 39:56.983
Cows make milk
and cats drink it.

39:56.985 --> 39:59.117
Oh... i see.

39:59.119 --> 40:02.688
What about hay?
Did you smell hay?

40:02.690 --> 40:04.791
'Course i smelled hay.

40:04.793 --> 40:06.693
But that has nothing
to do with it.

40:06.695 --> 40:10.063
[Barking]

40:10.065 --> 40:12.699
my advice...
go see the cats.

40:12.701 --> 40:15.168
They're crafty and sly

40:15.170 --> 40:17.936
and stick their nose
into everything.

40:17.938 --> 40:21.074
Nothing happens on this farm
without them knowing it.

40:21.076 --> 40:23.041
Oh, i can tell you,

40:23.043 --> 40:26.646
whatever happened,
it definitely involved the cats.

40:26.648 --> 40:30.048
They're always watching,
listening, calculating,

40:30.050 --> 40:32.719
always causing trouble
around the farm

40:32.721 --> 40:34.686
and they love milk.

40:34.688 --> 40:36.956
Do they eat hay?

40:36.958 --> 40:40.193
They might not eat it, but they
sleep on it and play with it.

40:40.195 --> 40:42.996
I'm sure the cats have something
to do with the missing hay.

40:42.998 --> 40:46.865
[Howls]

40:46.867 --> 40:49.401
where can i find the cats?

40:49.403 --> 40:51.403
Can they catch you, b oink?

40:51.405 --> 40:53.773
Nothing can catch a barn owl.

40:53.775 --> 40:55.407
Don't worry about me, oink.

40:55.409 --> 40:58.144
I'm much too big
for a cat to eat.

40:58.146 --> 41:00.146
And way too smart.

41:00.148 --> 41:03.081
But i bet you know
some fun facts about cats.

41:03.083 --> 41:06.184
Cats, ha,
don't get me started.

41:06.186 --> 41:08.287
I do know a lot about cats.

41:08.289 --> 41:12.325
An ancient african legend says
the first cat was created

41:12.327 --> 41:15.327
when god caused
a lion to sneeze.

41:15.329 --> 41:17.896
And two kittens
just up and flew out.

41:17.898 --> 41:20.333
How intriguing!
What else?

41:20.335 --> 41:22.735
Did you know
that cats beat dogs

41:22.737 --> 41:25.737
as the most popular pet
in the united states?

41:25.739 --> 41:27.673
Not pigs or birds?

41:27.675 --> 41:29.275
No, it's hard to believe,

41:29.277 --> 41:32.778
but there are
about 88 million pet cats.

41:32.780 --> 41:35.248
The most popular being
the persian cat.

41:35.250 --> 41:38.818
Followed by the main e coon
and the siamese cat.

41:38.820 --> 41:41.019
Cats are known
to be pretty cool fellows.

41:41.021 --> 41:42.954
How cool?

41:42.956 --> 41:44.423
Cats are so cool.

41:44.425 --> 41:47.726
They were considered
sacred in ancient egypt.

41:47.728 --> 41:50.128
How cool are cats?

41:50.130 --> 41:54.934
Well, they're so cool they sometimes can
go into politics. [Giggling] that's right.

41:54.936 --> 41:59.871
I heard of a cat that has been mayor
of a town in ala ska for 15 years.

41:59.873 --> 42:04.844
And in 2013, a cat ran
for mayor of mexico city.

42:04.846 --> 42:08.380
And abraham lincoln... he kept
four cats in the white house.

42:08.382 --> 42:10.483
That is amazing.

42:10.485 --> 42:12.719
What else can you tell me?

42:12.721 --> 42:15.420
Cats have whiskers
that they can use to detect

42:15.422 --> 42:17.190
if they can fit
through a space.

42:17.192 --> 42:20.358
Cats make about one hundred
different sounds,

42:20.360 --> 42:22.461
dogs make only about ten.

42:22.463 --> 42:25.831
Did you know adult cats meow
to communicate with humans?

42:25.833 --> 42:29.367
So, next time kitty meows,
humans should listen up.

42:29.369 --> 42:31.903
She's trying
to tell them something.

42:31.905 --> 42:34.005
Strange, but true.

42:34.007 --> 42:36.742
Female cats are
usually right pawed

42:36.744 --> 42:39.144
while male cats
are left pawed.

42:39.146 --> 42:40.780
How big do cats get?

42:40.782 --> 42:42.914
Well,
the biggest cat today

42:42.916 --> 42:46.885
is a wild cat
known as a siberian tiger.

42:46.887 --> 42:49.454
They can grow more
than 12 feet long.

42:49.456 --> 42:51.423
About the size
of a small car.

42:51.425 --> 42:54.025
And weigh up
to 700 pounds.

42:54.027 --> 42:57.429
But you won't find one
of those on farmer joe's farm.

42:57.431 --> 43:01.367
Farm cats are small and weigh
only about eight to 15 pounds.

43:01.369 --> 43:03.536
Although i did read
an article once that

43:03.538 --> 43:05.907
a cat that
weighed 28 pounds...

43:07.509 --> 43:10.976
[meows]

43:10.978 --> 43:14.380
- hello there, cat!
- You can call me small?

43:14.382 --> 43:17.215
Heard you were looking
for the missing hay.

43:17.217 --> 43:20.952
You can't solve mysteries
without the help of a cat.

43:20.954 --> 43:23.856
No, sire e.
[Laughing] so here i am.

43:23.858 --> 43:25.525
What can you tell us?

43:25.527 --> 43:27.260
The dog smelled milk.

43:27.262 --> 43:31.164
The dog... you mean to bias,
farmer joe's dog?

43:31.166 --> 43:32.498
What did he say?

43:32.500 --> 43:35.967
We were asking him
about the missing hay.

43:35.969 --> 43:38.403
He said he smelled
cats and milk.

43:38.405 --> 43:40.373
You drink milk?

43:40.375 --> 43:42.240
Do you eat hay?

43:42.242 --> 43:46.278
Have you ever taken a close look
at a cat's tongue?

43:46.280 --> 43:49.382
Can't say i have.
Why?

43:49.384 --> 43:52.985
Well, my tongue is so rough.
The middle of my tongue

43:52.987 --> 43:55.554
is covered in backward
pointing spines.

43:55.556 --> 43:58.124
- Sounds sharp.
- It is.

43:58.126 --> 44:01.092
You know what
these spines are for?

44:01.094 --> 44:04.429
Surely not for eating hay.

44:04.431 --> 44:09.101
I tell you. They're used for
breaking off and reaping meat.

44:09.103 --> 44:12.905
That's what for.
See? We are meat eaters.

44:12.907 --> 44:14.009
Not hay eaters.

44:15.876 --> 44:20.445
Just like the mighty tigers.
Their tongues have spines, too.

44:20.447 --> 44:22.849
But tell me about the hay.

44:22.851 --> 44:24.883
What do you know?

44:24.885 --> 44:28.119
You know,
cats are very observant.

44:28.121 --> 44:31.523
Nothing happens around the farm
without me finding out about it.

44:31.525 --> 44:34.427
So you know who stole the hay?

44:34.429 --> 44:36.461
[Cat]
it has to have happened

44:36.463 --> 44:40.566
when i was chasing one of the farm mice.
Pesky creatures, mice.

44:40.568 --> 44:42.400
Do mice eat hay?

44:42.402 --> 44:45.438
[Cat]
meow. Mice eat anything.

44:45.440 --> 44:49.008
But on the farm, they like
to eat farmer joe's props.

44:49.010 --> 44:51.276
They love to eat
corn and oats.

44:51.278 --> 44:54.179
They like to nibble
on farmer joe's garden carrots,

44:54.181 --> 44:57.483
which makes
farmer joe's wife very mad.

44:57.485 --> 45:01.019
They even like to dig up
our heirloom purple potatoes.

45:01.021 --> 45:02.588
Do they have hooves?

45:02.590 --> 45:05.358
- Of course not.
- Big ears?

45:05.360 --> 45:09.362
For their size, some of them
have very big funny ears.

45:09.364 --> 45:11.530
Mice are small creatures.

45:11.532 --> 45:15.034
I don't think they could eat
more than a small pile of hay.

45:15.036 --> 45:17.903
Time to go get some human
treats now. [Giggling]

45:17.905 --> 45:19.537
but i do have a clue.

45:19.539 --> 45:21.474
I love clues!

45:21.476 --> 45:26.278
The day the hay went missing,
i heard a lot of quacking.

45:26.280 --> 45:28.981
Quacking? [Quacking]
like in ducks?

45:28.983 --> 45:31.918
When ducks are noisy,
they're up to something.

45:31.920 --> 45:33.952
I was going to
check it out myself,

45:33.954 --> 45:36.621
but... then i saw a mouse.

45:36.623 --> 45:39.124
See you later, fellas.

45:39.126 --> 45:41.594
Ducks don't have hooves
or big ears,

45:41.596 --> 45:44.697
but they might have seen
something.

45:44.699 --> 45:47.233
[Quacking]
to the pond we go.

45:47.235 --> 45:49.334
[Quacking]

45:49.336 --> 45:51.103
hmmm...
ba-zoo ks.

45:51.105 --> 45:53.271
Me thinks the cat
was not telling the truth.

45:53.273 --> 45:57.043
He was sleeping on hay,
on hay, all the day.

45:57.045 --> 46:00.412
Me thinks the cat
has more to say.

46:00.414 --> 46:03.682
Well, it's true.
Ducks don't have hooves.

46:03.684 --> 46:05.517
They have webbed feet.

46:05.519 --> 46:07.686
And they don't have
big floppy ears.

46:07.688 --> 46:10.488
Their ears are holes
on either side of their head

46:10.490 --> 46:12.458
covered by feathers.

46:12.460 --> 46:13.693
And they don't have horns.

46:13.695 --> 46:15.461
They're not wool y.

46:15.463 --> 46:17.996
Do they like to eat hay?

46:17.998 --> 46:21.099
It's not their favorite food,
but i believe they do.

46:21.101 --> 46:23.568
Listen to all that quacking.

46:23.570 --> 46:25.704
Not all ducks quack.

46:25.706 --> 46:27.639
The wood duck
doesn't quack.

46:27.641 --> 46:29.407
He squeals.

46:29.409 --> 46:30.508
Like me.

46:30.510 --> 46:32.144
Pigs squeal and grunt.

46:32.146 --> 46:34.412
What do you call
a baby duck?

46:34.414 --> 46:35.680
A duckling.

46:35.682 --> 46:38.383
An adult male duck
is called a drake.

46:38.385 --> 46:41.653
An adult female duck
is called a hen or a duck.

46:41.655 --> 46:46.624
And a group of ducks can be
called a raft, team or paddling.

46:46.626 --> 46:51.030
What? Those are very silly words
to describe a group of ducks.

46:51.032 --> 46:54.566
Who comes up with all these
terms anyway?

46:54.568 --> 46:56.369
Scientists do.

46:56.371 --> 46:59.005
Confusing but fun, right?

46:59.007 --> 47:01.539
Here's some
more facts about ducks.

47:01.541 --> 47:04.010
Ducklings are able
to walk and leave the nest

47:04.012 --> 47:06.479
just a few hours
after hatching.

47:06.481 --> 47:11.016
That's right, they're ready
to look for a place to swim.

47:11.018 --> 47:13.019
They're very brave
little fellows.

47:13.021 --> 47:14.456
[Quacks]

47:17.791 --> 47:19.358
ahoy there!

47:19.360 --> 47:21.360
I'm oink the flying pig.

47:21.362 --> 47:24.630
And this is my know-it-all pal,
b oink, the owl.

47:24.632 --> 47:27.566
I'm muck the duck.
What can i do for you, oink?

47:27.568 --> 47:32.204
I'm investigating farmer joe's
missing hay.

47:32.206 --> 47:35.074
I've heard it's something
you like to eat.

47:35.076 --> 47:38.577
Quack, quack. I might nibble on
grass and hay when i'm bored

47:38.579 --> 47:40.445
or quack when
there's nothing else to eat,

47:40.447 --> 47:44.182
but it's not
my favorite treat. Quack.

47:44.184 --> 47:46.184
See, just like you
pigs and humans,

47:46.186 --> 47:47.686
us ducks are omnivorous.

47:47.688 --> 47:50.055
It means we eat grass
and aquatic plants,

47:50.057 --> 47:53.325
but also insects, seeds, fruits, fish,
crabs, and other types of food.

47:53.327 --> 47:57.563
But hay, well, hay is not
very exciting food, you see.

47:57.565 --> 47:59.197
With so many options,

47:59.199 --> 48:01.367
why would i care about hay?

48:01.369 --> 48:06.438
H mm... maybe you needed material
to build a little boat

48:06.440 --> 48:08.407
to go fishing for crabs.

48:08.409 --> 48:11.744
A boat? Ha!
Quack, quack, quack!

48:11.746 --> 48:14.746
What would i need a boat for?
My dear oink,

48:14.748 --> 48:18.450
what you see in front of you is
a magnificent swimming machine.

48:18.452 --> 48:20.418
I spend most of
my day in the water.

48:20.420 --> 48:22.220
No need for a boat.

48:22.222 --> 48:24.423
Water is my element.

48:24.425 --> 48:26.092
Look at these webbed feet.

48:26.094 --> 48:28.594
These webbed feet cause me
to waddle on land, sure,

48:28.596 --> 48:31.329
but in the water,
[laughing] i'm king.

48:31.331 --> 48:34.166
Webbed feet, you say.

48:34.168 --> 48:39.104
Quack. My webbed feet act like
paddles when i'm in the water.

48:39.106 --> 48:43.508
I can be in the water all year.
Even in the winter. No problem.

48:43.510 --> 48:47.213
That's because my feet have
no nerves or blood vessels.

48:47.215 --> 48:49.280
Did you know that my feet
cannot feel cold

48:49.282 --> 48:54.220
even if i swim in icy cold
water? Can your hooves do that?

48:54.222 --> 48:56.421
Maybe you used the hay

48:56.423 --> 48:59.258
to make yourself
a little waterproof suit.

48:59.260 --> 49:04.729
Quack, quack, quack.
Don't make me laugh, silly pig.

49:04.731 --> 49:07.266
I possess waterproof feathers.

49:07.268 --> 49:08.833
There's a special waxy coating

49:08.835 --> 49:11.537
that i spread through
my feathers during preening.

49:11.539 --> 49:14.240
What's this preening?

49:14.242 --> 49:16.909
All birds with feathers
do it.

49:16.911 --> 49:19.778
Preening is when a bird
cleans its feathers.

49:19.780 --> 49:22.180
I preen, too.

49:22.182 --> 49:25.316
But my feathers are special.

49:25.318 --> 49:29.188
They're so waterproof that even
when i dive under water,

49:29.190 --> 49:33.358
my downy under layer of feathers
will stay completely dry.

49:33.360 --> 49:36.829
These feathers keep me toasty
warm no matter the weather.

49:36.831 --> 49:38.697
Who needs your hay?

49:38.699 --> 49:43.334
[Oinking] i guess ducks
have no use for hay.

49:43.336 --> 49:49.208
So why were you quacking so loud
on the day the hay went missing?

49:49.210 --> 49:52.744
What day was that? Oh yeah,
never mind, i remember.

49:52.746 --> 49:57.349
- I was quacking at the frogs.
- The frogs?

49:57.351 --> 50:00.586
Frogs are very noisy amphibians
with very long tongues

50:00.588 --> 50:04.423
that live on the other side
of the pond in the greasy marsh.

50:04.425 --> 50:08.793
They were croaking rather
loudly so i quacked back.

50:08.795 --> 50:11.197
What's an amphibian?

50:11.199 --> 50:15.300
An amphibian refers to
a group of cold-blooded animals

50:15.302 --> 50:18.269
like frogs, toads,
and salamanders.

50:18.271 --> 50:20.673
Do they eat hay?

50:20.675 --> 50:23.474
Quack, quack.
They might not eat hay,

50:23.476 --> 50:26.711
but they have really big eyes
that see everything.

50:26.713 --> 50:30.682
They move upward and forward and
sideways all of the same time.

50:30.684 --> 50:32.851
If you wanna solve the mystery
of the missing hay,

50:32.853 --> 50:35.289
i'd go see those jumping
frogs right away.

50:38.458 --> 50:41.626
What do you know
about frogs, b oink?

50:41.628 --> 50:44.630
I know frogs can live
on both land and water.

50:44.632 --> 50:48.467
But they need to live near water
or they'll dry out.

50:48.469 --> 50:50.802
I know they soak water
through their skin.

50:50.804 --> 50:54.840
Muck the duck, said they have
really long tongues.

50:54.842 --> 50:57.309
Don't they use them
to drink water?

50:57.311 --> 51:00.545
No, their tongues are different
than most animals.

51:00.547 --> 51:02.780
Their tongues are sticky
and muscular

51:02.782 --> 51:05.450
and located in the front
part of their mouth.

51:05.452 --> 51:07.952
They can whip out their tongues
really fast and far

51:07.954 --> 51:12.925
to catch insects like flies,
mosquitoes, moths and dragonflies.

51:12.927 --> 51:14.959
That is interesting.

51:14.961 --> 51:17.762
What else do you
know about frogs?

51:17.764 --> 51:19.430
Frogs are carnivores,

51:19.432 --> 51:21.566
which means
they like to eat meat.

51:21.568 --> 51:24.403
They also have powerful
back legs and webbed feet.

51:24.405 --> 51:26.738
- Like the ducks.
- That's right.

51:26.740 --> 51:30.976
Frogs also use their powerful
legs to jump very high.

51:30.978 --> 51:34.412
Another fact: many frogs
lay eggs in water.

51:34.414 --> 51:38.016
Their eggs hatch into
what is called tadpoles,

51:38.018 --> 51:40.719
which look more
like fish than frogs.

51:40.721 --> 51:43.322
A group of frogs
is called an army.

51:43.324 --> 51:46.425
An army? Are we flying
into an ambush?

51:46.427 --> 51:49.695
Hoot! I don't think so.

51:49.697 --> 51:51.764
But frogs
will see us coming.

51:51.766 --> 51:55.733
They have excellent eyesight,
and they never close their eyes.

51:55.735 --> 51:57.802
Even when they're sleeping?

51:57.804 --> 51:59.671
Hoot! That's right!

51:59.673 --> 52:02.807
Their eyes are always open so
they might have seen something

52:02.809 --> 52:06.010
that will help us solve
the mystery of the missing hay.

52:06.012 --> 52:08.680
They also have eardrums
behind their eyes

52:08.682 --> 52:11.349
and have a very good
sense of hearing.

52:11.351 --> 52:15.923
So maybe they heard something
and can give us another clue.

52:20.927 --> 52:24.595
Good day, little frog!
I'm oink the flying pig.

52:24.597 --> 52:26.965
Oh, yes,
i heard you were coming.

52:26.967 --> 52:30.969
Those gossiping quacking ducks
think we can't understand them,

52:30.971 --> 52:33.871
but we hear everything they say.

52:33.873 --> 52:36.941
You are looking for a suspect
who has big ears, two horns,

52:36.943 --> 52:39.677
- hooves, wool y body...
- that's right!

52:39.679 --> 52:42.113
Do you have another clue?

52:42.115 --> 52:44.083
I have the best clue of all.

52:44.085 --> 52:46.918
You see, i've been
listening closely

52:46.920 --> 52:49.755
to all the animals talking
to you since you arrived,

52:49.757 --> 52:53.925
and i learned that some of these
clues, my sleuth flying pig,

52:53.927 --> 52:56.829
- are red herrings.
- Red what?

52:56.831 --> 53:01.099
A red herring is a false clue
that is meant to be misleading

53:01.101 --> 53:03.434
- to prevent you from solving the mystery.
- [Rib bit]

53:03.436 --> 53:07.840
oh, no. So the animal
that stole the hay

53:07.842 --> 53:12.644
might not have hooves
or horns or big wool y bodies?

53:12.646 --> 53:15.780
That's right, little pig.
Listen to what i say.

53:15.782 --> 53:20.651
Why would i, a frog, want
to steal farmer joe's hay?

53:20.653 --> 53:24.423
Croak, rib bit.
Croak, rib bit.

53:24.425 --> 53:26.825
Some animals are trying
to fool you today.

53:26.827 --> 53:31.996
Hoot! Oh, my, franc is frog!
I think you're right.

53:31.998 --> 53:34.499
Thank you so much
for your keen insight.

53:34.501 --> 53:37.603
You see, my friend,
if i were trying to find

53:37.605 --> 53:40.873
who stole the hay,
i'd talk to the llamas.

53:40.875 --> 53:44.713
They have hooves, wool y bodies
and they eat hay all day.

53:48.681 --> 53:51.816
What do you know
about llamas, b oink?

53:51.818 --> 53:55.186
Llamas were domesticated
about 5,000 years ago.

53:55.188 --> 54:00.159
An adult llama can weigh
from 200 to 450 pounds.

54:00.161 --> 54:03.929
That means they eat
a lot of hay.

54:03.931 --> 54:07.833
Yes, llamas have one stomach
with three compartments

54:07.835 --> 54:12.037
which they like to fill with
grass, grain, and lots of hay.

54:12.039 --> 54:15.206
Like horses,
they are gentle animals,

54:15.208 --> 54:18.010
and they like to eat apples
and carrots as treats.

54:18.012 --> 54:23.514
A male llama is called a sire,
a female llama is called a dam,

54:23.516 --> 54:26.485
and a baby is called a cria.

54:26.487 --> 54:29.054
A group of llamas
is called a herd.

54:29.056 --> 54:31.523
I've heard that word before.

54:31.525 --> 54:35.059
Like sheep, llamas have
beautiful wool y coats.

54:35.061 --> 54:40.499
[Squealing] so a wool y coat
could be a clue.

54:40.501 --> 54:41.967
Yes, it could.

54:41.969 --> 54:44.769
Llamas are very intelligent
and loyal

54:44.771 --> 54:47.572
and can carry heavy loads
on their backs.

54:47.574 --> 54:51.242
They talk to each other
by moving their ears and tails.

54:51.244 --> 54:55.581
They make a low soft sound
like a person humming.

54:55.583 --> 54:56.985
Really?
I can't wait to meet them.

55:00.588 --> 55:03.521
Ah, señores,
let me introduce myself.

55:03.523 --> 55:06.191
I am lupe the llama.
And you are?

55:06.193 --> 55:07.825
Oink, the flying pig.

55:07.827 --> 55:10.829
And this is b oink,
the wise old barn owl.

55:10.831 --> 55:12.697
H mm...

55:12.699 --> 55:15.967
you are here to ask me questions
about farmer joe's missing hay.

55:15.969 --> 55:17.503
H mm? H mm?

55:17.505 --> 55:19.137
That is correct.

55:19.139 --> 55:22.773
H mm... did you know that we
llamas make the best guards?

55:22.775 --> 55:24.041
Farmers like us.

55:24.043 --> 55:25.844
Because we protect cows,

55:25.846 --> 55:28.780
sheep and other farm animals
from predators.

55:28.782 --> 55:30.682
That sounds important.

55:30.684 --> 55:34.552
Can you tell us anything
about the missing hay?

55:34.554 --> 55:39.925
H mm, i will not lie.
If there is hay, i will eat it.

55:39.927 --> 55:42.728
Us llamas can eat
many pounds of food a day,

55:42.730 --> 55:47.199
- and we only need a little bit of water to wash it down.
- Like camels?

55:47.201 --> 55:51.103
Si, señor, pig, llamas are
related to camels.

55:51.105 --> 55:53.204
But we don't have humps
on our back,

55:53.206 --> 55:54.940
which makes
us prettier, no?

55:54.942 --> 55:57.742
H mm, but now
i will tell you a clue.

55:57.744 --> 55:59.577
I will tell you of animals

55:59.579 --> 56:02.613
that are always stealing from
other animals on the farm.

56:02.615 --> 56:04.849
That's a good clue.

56:04.851 --> 56:09.320
- If it's true...
- oh, this i can tell you. It's very, very true.

56:09.322 --> 56:12.291
Wild rabbits eat grass
and hay, just like you,

56:12.293 --> 56:13.825
but because they are wild,

56:13.827 --> 56:15.793
farmer joe doesn't feed
it to them,

56:15.795 --> 56:19.331
so they hop around stealing
portions from everyone's pen.

56:19.333 --> 56:21.700
I will go see
these wild rabbits,

56:21.702 --> 56:25.304
but don't go anywhere. I might
need to talk to you again.

56:25.306 --> 56:27.738
H mm, señor pig, do not fear,

56:27.740 --> 56:30.911
i will not go anywhere
because i like it here.

56:33.880 --> 56:35.813
Zoo ks, lookie see.

56:35.815 --> 56:38.251
That hidden pile over there
looks like hay to me.

56:42.121 --> 56:44.021
What do you think, b oink?

56:44.023 --> 56:46.691
Do you think a group
of wild rabbits

56:46.693 --> 56:49.860
could steal
farmer joe's bale of hay?

56:49.862 --> 56:54.800
One rabbit? Two rabbits?
Of course not.

56:54.802 --> 56:59.137
Those little fellows couldn't
steal a big bale of hay.

56:59.139 --> 57:01.340
But there are a lot of
rabbits in the world.

57:01.342 --> 57:06.177
Well, i've read over 2 million human
families have rabbits as pets.

57:06.179 --> 57:09.680
Good thing most of them are smart
enough to be litter-trained.

57:09.682 --> 57:12.050
Litter-trained?
Don't tell the cat.

57:12.052 --> 57:15.354
But why do humans
like rabbits so much?

57:15.356 --> 57:18.123
Hoo-hoo!
Hoo-hoo!

57:18.125 --> 57:21.860
I think it's because humans
find them irresistible.

57:21.862 --> 57:25.731
One of the cutest things
rabbits do is the b inky.

57:25.733 --> 57:29.200
When they're happy, they will
jump and twist in the air.

57:29.202 --> 57:32.737
Like me? Oh, my, b oink,
can they fly?

57:32.739 --> 57:36.240
Never heard
of a flying rabbit, but...

57:36.242 --> 57:39.146
then again, i never
heard of a flying pig.

57:40.880 --> 57:43.949
Rabbits are very social.

57:43.951 --> 57:46.751
They love to live in groups
called a herd.

57:46.753 --> 57:48.954
Wait, they live in herds, too?

57:48.956 --> 57:51.123
Hoot! Yes.

57:51.125 --> 57:54.726
As we've learned, many animals
live in herds, oink.

57:54.728 --> 57:57.996
Herds of wild rabbits can be
found in meadows, woods,

57:57.998 --> 58:01.900
forests, grasslands,
deserts and wetlands.

58:01.902 --> 58:06.170
The swamp rabbit lives
near water. It can swim.

58:06.172 --> 58:08.940
Other rabbits live
in underground burrows.

58:08.942 --> 58:12.244
A group of rabbit burrows
known as a warren.

58:12.246 --> 58:14.378
What is a female rabbit called?

58:14.380 --> 58:17.215
- A doe.
- Like a deer?

58:17.217 --> 58:21.853
Exactly. And like a deer,
a male rabbit is called a buck.

58:21.855 --> 58:24.822
Words can be so confusing.

58:24.824 --> 58:26.958
Wanna be more confused?

58:26.960 --> 58:30.862
A young rabbit is called
a kit or sometimes a kitten.

58:30.864 --> 58:35.066
[Laughing] [oinking] a kitten?
Does the cat know that?

58:35.068 --> 58:37.001
I always thought
they were just called

58:37.003 --> 58:40.204
cute little furry cuddly
bunny rabbits. [Laughing]

58:40.206 --> 58:42.273
rabbits are not always furry.

58:42.275 --> 58:45.943
In fact, little baby rabbits
are born with their eyes closed

58:45.945 --> 58:47.945
and not a lick of fur,

58:47.947 --> 58:51.249
so they depend on momma
rabbit for their survival.

58:51.251 --> 58:54.251
Looks like a lot of them
live down there by that barn.

58:54.253 --> 58:56.921
Rabbits produce
very quickly.

58:56.923 --> 58:58.389
On average,
a wild momma rabbit

58:58.391 --> 59:00.825
will have five babies
per litter

59:00.827 --> 59:03.128
and over five
litters per season.

59:03.130 --> 59:07.766
And a rabbit's breeding season
is eight months out of the year.

59:07.768 --> 59:10.267
So that's a lot
of little bunnies.

59:10.269 --> 59:13.271
That's a lot of hay
to be eaten.

59:13.273 --> 59:14.275
[Bunny laughs]

59:21.914 --> 59:24.182
oh, look.
A flying pig.

59:24.184 --> 59:25.282
Hello there!

59:25.284 --> 59:26.784
I'm oink the pig.

59:26.786 --> 59:28.519
And i'm sunny the bunny.

59:28.521 --> 59:30.488
What can i do
for you, oink?

59:30.490 --> 59:36.327
I'm investigating the mystery
of farmer joe's missing hay.

59:36.329 --> 59:38.063
Ah, hay!

59:38.065 --> 59:39.865
I love hay!

59:39.867 --> 59:44.202
Ah-ha! Did you take
farm joe's hay?

59:44.204 --> 59:46.838
I heard the hay was
taken during the day,

59:46.840 --> 59:50.775
and rabbits are crepuscular.
So it couldn't have been me.

59:50.777 --> 59:53.478
Crepuscular?
What does that mean?

59:53.480 --> 59:57.048
It means we are most active
at dawn and dusk,

59:57.050 --> 59:59.950
and that's also when
we prefer to eat.

59:59.952 --> 01:00:02.887
Ah! Actually,
sunny the bunny,

01:00:02.889 --> 01:00:07.559
i have calculated that the stolen hay
went missing just around that time.

01:00:07.561 --> 01:00:11.530
Really? Well, i don't deny
that i love hay,

01:00:11.532 --> 01:00:16.133
but i also love grass,
clover, and wildflowers.

01:00:16.135 --> 01:00:18.836
I also eat a lot
of chewy foods.

01:00:18.838 --> 01:00:20.338
That's because of my teeth.

01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.572
Your teeth?

01:00:21.574 --> 01:00:24.842
Yes, my teeth never
stop growing.

01:00:24.844 --> 01:00:26.211
I need chewy treats

01:00:26.213 --> 01:00:29.380
so i can keep the growth
of my teeth in check.

01:00:29.382 --> 01:00:31.282
I love to chew,

01:00:31.284 --> 01:00:34.052
but all that chewing
makes me thirsty.

01:00:34.054 --> 01:00:37.222
Did you know us rabbits
drink a lot of water?

01:00:37.224 --> 01:00:39.925
Good thing you live
close to a pond.

01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:44.162
It is. A four-pound rabbit
like me will drink as much water

01:00:44.164 --> 01:00:47.833
as a 20-pound dog.
Can you believe it?

01:00:47.835 --> 01:00:51.336
Well, if that's all,
i'll go back to my grooming.

01:00:51.338 --> 01:00:52.503
Grooming?

01:00:52.505 --> 01:00:54.840
Rabbits don't groom, do they?

01:00:54.842 --> 01:00:56.208
Oh, yes, we do.

01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:58.577
We groom just like cats.

01:00:58.579 --> 01:01:01.912
So if you don't mind,
i'll resume my grooming.

01:01:01.914 --> 01:01:03.514
I do mind.

01:01:03.516 --> 01:01:06.284
I think you're telling me
everything about yourself

01:01:06.286 --> 01:01:11.055
except whether you did or did
not take the stolen hay.

01:01:11.057 --> 01:01:13.557
If i were looking
for a bale of missing hay,

01:01:13.559 --> 01:01:17.095
i'd talk to the farm animal
who eats the most.

01:01:17.097 --> 01:01:18.929
Who would that be,
little rabbit?

01:01:18.931 --> 01:01:22.133
A cow, of course.
They are herbivore like me

01:01:22.135 --> 01:01:25.003
that eats more hay
than all of my herd combined.

01:01:25.005 --> 01:01:29.541
I will go see the cows,
but don't go anywhere.

01:01:29.543 --> 01:01:31.878
I might want to talk
to you again.

01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:34.382
[Bunny laughs]

01:01:36.884 --> 01:01:40.887
ba-zoo ks! Buzz, i think oink
is finally beginning to see.

01:01:45.057 --> 01:01:47.925
Oh, we're going
to visit the cows.

01:01:47.927 --> 01:01:52.299
I love cows. Because of cows,
we have ice cream.

01:01:54.101 --> 01:01:59.003
Ice cream comes from milk
and milk comes from cows.

01:01:59.005 --> 01:02:01.940
That's right, oink.
Cows give us milk.

01:02:01.942 --> 01:02:04.675
But did you know that cows
are very emotional?

01:02:04.677 --> 01:02:07.412
Emotional?
What do you mean, b oink?

01:02:07.414 --> 01:02:10.548
Like people,
cows form close relationships

01:02:10.550 --> 01:02:12.217
and choose to spend
much of their time

01:02:12.219 --> 01:02:14.619
with a few
favorite friends.

01:02:14.621 --> 01:02:18.523
And just like people,
they can hold grudges for years

01:02:18.525 --> 01:02:22.526
and may dislike certain cows
while they like others better.

01:02:22.528 --> 01:02:25.130
- I didn't know that.
- Yes.

01:02:25.132 --> 01:02:27.432
Cows are very gentle
and friendly.

01:02:27.434 --> 01:02:30.936
And they love to live
together in groups or herds.

01:02:30.938 --> 01:02:33.070
A baby cow is called a calf.

01:02:33.072 --> 01:02:35.974
Mother cows love
their babies so much.

01:02:35.976 --> 01:02:40.512
If they stray, they'll walk
for miles to find their calf.

01:02:40.514 --> 01:02:44.615
If that calf grows up into
a male, that's called a bull.

01:02:44.617 --> 01:02:48.153
I've heard bulls can be
very protective.

01:02:48.155 --> 01:02:51.722
Yes, here's some funny
facts about cows.

01:02:51.724 --> 01:02:56.528
Did you know that you can lead a
cow upstairs but not downstairs?

01:02:56.530 --> 01:03:00.065
That is funny. [Laughing]
[oinking] why is that?

01:03:00.067 --> 01:03:04.101
Because cows' knees can't bend
properly to walk downstairs.

01:03:04.103 --> 01:03:06.003
So if you invite a cow over,

01:03:06.005 --> 01:03:08.106
make sure you have
a big elevator.

01:03:08.108 --> 01:03:09.376
[Cow moos]

01:03:12.346 --> 01:03:15.349
b oink, is that
the missing hay?

01:03:18.518 --> 01:03:22.220
[Chewing]

01:03:22.222 --> 01:03:25.423
hello there,
little flying pig.

01:03:25.425 --> 01:03:27.691
We've been expecting you.

01:03:27.693 --> 01:03:29.193
[Squealing]

01:03:29.195 --> 01:03:31.028
you knew i was coming?

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:35.166
I might be color blind, unable
to see the colors red or green,

01:03:35.168 --> 01:03:40.271
but did you know that i have almost
360-degree panoramic vision?

01:03:40.273 --> 01:03:44.309
That's right. It's not easy
to sneak up on a cow.

01:03:44.311 --> 01:03:46.043
Amazing!

01:03:46.045 --> 01:03:48.112
Well, i'm oink
the flying pig.

01:03:48.114 --> 01:03:50.115
And i'm here on a mission.

01:03:50.117 --> 01:03:55.253
I'm investigating the mystery
of the missing hay.

01:03:55.255 --> 01:03:59.590
I'm daisy the cow,
and i'm sacred.

01:03:59.592 --> 01:04:02.059
So be careful
how you talk to me.

01:04:02.061 --> 01:04:04.262
You're... sacred?

01:04:04.264 --> 01:04:06.363
Cows are sacred in india.

01:04:06.365 --> 01:04:08.532
Meaning they're treated
very special.

01:04:08.534 --> 01:04:10.635
But this is not india.

01:04:10.637 --> 01:04:12.470
It's farmer joe's farm.

01:04:12.472 --> 01:04:16.708
In india,
we're considered so sacred

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:18.742
there are even special
festivities

01:04:18.744 --> 01:04:21.278
that honor only cows.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.048
On certain days,

01:04:23.050 --> 01:04:27.151
we're washed and decorated
with colorful costumes

01:04:27.153 --> 01:04:30.220
and honored by humans
in beautiful temples.

01:04:30.222 --> 01:04:33.691
Really? I don't think pigs
have a day like that.

01:04:33.693 --> 01:04:35.827
Nor do barn owls.

01:04:35.829 --> 01:04:39.563
That's because cows can produce
eight gallons of milk per day.

01:04:39.565 --> 01:04:41.398
Amazing!

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:45.470
It is. Milk is one of
america's favorite beverages.

01:04:45.472 --> 01:04:47.104
An average american

01:04:47.106 --> 01:04:49.706
will drink more than 20 gallons
of milk in a year.

01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:53.378
I'll tell you.
Humans love my milk.

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.548
Besides, from my milk, you
can make many other products,

01:04:56.550 --> 01:04:59.851
like cheese, yogurt,
and even ice cream.

01:04:59.853 --> 01:05:02.253
I love ice cream!

01:05:02.255 --> 01:05:05.824
I understand you are a very
special animal, daisy the cow,

01:05:05.826 --> 01:05:10.528
but i am investigating
the mystery of the missing hay,

01:05:10.530 --> 01:05:13.401
and you are eating
a lot of hay as we speak.

01:05:15.869 --> 01:05:17.869
Oh, this?
[Clearing throat]

01:05:17.871 --> 01:05:19.336
this is my lunch.

01:05:19.338 --> 01:05:21.438
I always eat hay.

01:05:21.440 --> 01:05:25.209
Why, i eat lots
of hay every day.

01:05:25.211 --> 01:05:29.713
Still, that is a lot
of hay you're eating.

01:05:29.715 --> 01:05:31.449
This is no thin' for a cow.

01:05:31.451 --> 01:05:34.786
You see,
i have four stomachs.

01:05:34.788 --> 01:05:36.621
Four?

01:05:36.623 --> 01:05:40.592
Technically, you have one large
stomach with four chambers.

01:05:40.594 --> 01:05:42.693
You are a ruminant animal.

01:05:42.695 --> 01:05:44.394
Like billy the goat.

01:05:44.396 --> 01:05:47.534
Yes, my stomach helps me
break down all the hay i eat.

01:05:49.503 --> 01:05:54.505
H mm... wait a minute,
what kind of feet do you have?

01:05:54.507 --> 01:05:58.443
Well, if you must know,
i have hooves.

01:05:58.445 --> 01:05:59.878
And two horns.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:02.646
I have two horns,
a four-compartment stomach,

01:06:02.648 --> 01:06:03.780
and four hooves.

01:06:03.782 --> 01:06:05.182
So what of it?

01:06:05.184 --> 01:06:08.586
And you have
sort of big ears.

01:06:08.588 --> 01:06:11.789
My ears are not big.

01:06:11.791 --> 01:06:17.162
And you do smell of delicious milk
like to bias, the dog, told me.

01:06:17.164 --> 01:06:18.766
But you aren't very wool y...

01:06:20.934 --> 01:06:23.367
that could be a red herring.

01:06:23.369 --> 01:06:26.306
Are you trying to keep me
from solving this mystery?

01:06:29.175 --> 01:06:32.276
Maybe some of the clues
are red herrings,

01:06:32.278 --> 01:06:35.646
but most of the clues point
to you, daisy, the cow.

01:06:35.648 --> 01:06:39.717
- Me? So "moo" of it?
- What's that?

01:06:39.719 --> 01:06:40.653
Is that hay?

01:06:42.755 --> 01:06:46.594
Z oinks, oink has finally
solved the mystery.

01:06:48.695 --> 01:06:51.628
This is definitely
a pile of hay,

01:06:51.630 --> 01:06:54.599
and it's now where farmer joe
usually piles the hay.

01:06:54.601 --> 01:06:55.536
It's hidden here.

01:06:56.835 --> 01:06:58.735
"Moo-kay."
[Laughing]

01:06:58.737 --> 01:07:00.304
you caught me,
little pig.

01:07:00.306 --> 01:07:04.208
This is the missing hay.
But it wasn't me.

01:07:04.210 --> 01:07:05.876
It was farmer joe's nephew.

01:07:05.878 --> 01:07:07.711
Ah-ha!
[Squealing]

01:07:07.713 --> 01:07:09.447
you admit it!

01:07:09.449 --> 01:07:12.784
[Oink] we did it! We
found the missing hay!

01:07:12.786 --> 01:07:16.820
Now you, daisy, the cow,
must return it right away.

01:07:16.822 --> 01:07:19.557
Moo-sorry.

01:07:19.559 --> 01:07:20.992
Can't return it.

01:07:20.994 --> 01:07:23.461
Why ever not?

01:07:23.463 --> 01:07:27.932
Because i already ate...
most of it.

01:07:27.934 --> 01:07:30.702
You see, it's already gone
right through me.

01:07:30.704 --> 01:07:33.804
Down my four stomachs, down
to my hooves, up to my horns,

01:07:33.806 --> 01:07:36.740
through all my cow grooves,
and best of all,

01:07:36.742 --> 01:07:40.677
to my delicious milk that's
gonna be used to make ice cream

01:07:40.679 --> 01:07:42.679
for farmer joe and his ilk.

01:07:42.681 --> 01:07:46.883
Don't be mad, farmer joe's
nephew didn't steal the hay.

01:07:46.885 --> 01:07:50.021
He was sit tin' on the big ole
pile of hay, thinking,

01:07:50.023 --> 01:07:54.391
"what i really want on this hot,
summer day is some ice cream."

01:07:54.393 --> 01:07:56.360
He saw me chewing
the hay and said,

01:07:56.362 --> 01:07:59.463
"hey, daisy, if i give you
some more of this hay,

01:07:59.465 --> 01:08:01.432
will you produce
more milk today?"

01:08:01.434 --> 01:08:03.534
So i said, "of course!"

01:08:03.536 --> 01:08:07.371
And he said, "i'm sure my
uncle farmer joe won't mind

01:08:07.373 --> 01:08:10.907
if i just borrow this pile
of hay for you to eat.

01:08:10.909 --> 01:08:13.411
As long as we chum it
into ice cream tomorrow."

01:08:13.413 --> 01:08:17.415
Oink, ice cream.
I do love ice cream.

01:08:17.417 --> 01:08:19.317
Then don't be mad.

01:08:19.319 --> 01:08:22.986
Tell farmer joe i'll give him
and his family lots of milk.

01:08:22.988 --> 01:08:26.691
Lots of milk to make all
the ice cream they want.

01:08:26.693 --> 01:08:30.495
And there will be enough
for the farm animals to enjoy...

01:08:30.497 --> 01:08:31.828
including you.

01:08:31.831 --> 01:08:33.667

That's it, b oink.
We saved the day.

of the missing hay.

01:09:01.961 --> 01:09:06.330

pig sleuth.

01:09:06.332 --> 01:09:08.832

01:09:08.835 --> 01:09:13.036

barn owl in the world.

any mystery.

and mystery solving

01:09:20.078 --> 01:09:23.915
