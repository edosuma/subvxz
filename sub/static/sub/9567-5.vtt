00:01.520 --> 00:02.599
You put a kid in hospital.

00:02.600 --> 00:05.439
I couldn't stand the way that
she was fucking looking at him.

00:05.440 --> 00:06.399
I love him.

00:06.400 --> 00:08.919
Sentence set for two
weeks from today.

00:08.920 --> 00:11.839
This house is being taken from us.

00:11.840 --> 00:15.839
- We need somewhere to stay.
- You're having a fucking laugh!

00:15.960 --> 00:19.959
I fucked the dead girl,
and now she's punishing me for it.

I really fucking love you.

01:45.240 --> 01:47.479
Raise it a million.

02:07.200 --> 02:09.239
<i>Ciao mi bella bambini!</i>

02:09.240 --> 02:12.919
<i>I'm drinking a macchiato in
Saint Fucking Peter's Square,</i>

02:12.920 --> 02:15.119
<i>exactly where we sat in the summer.</i>

02:15.120 --> 02:18.119
<i>I'm just thinking of you.
Hope you're all right, darling.</i>

02:18.120 --> 02:20.479
<i>I'm having an amazing time with Aldo</i>

02:20.480 --> 02:23.319
<i>so, look, I'm gonna stay on
a bit longer, sweetheart</i>

02:23.320 --> 02:26.079

<i>I'm missing you loads, and turn
your mobile on, love, yeah?</i>

02:29.040 --> 02:30.679
<i>I'll call you later.</i>

02:31.240 --> 02:32.839
<i>Va fan, fuck yourself!</i>

02:47.160 --> 02:51.159
Morning, beautiful.

02:51.640 --> 02:54.799
Oh, shit!

02:54.800 --> 02:58.799
Judgment day.

03:00.800 --> 03:04.799
Eff, what's the matter?

03:07.800 --> 03:09.399
Come on, it won't be long.

03:09.400 --> 03:12.599
It'll only be a bollocking about
attendance or something.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.639
Just...don't.

03:13.640 --> 03:16.199
You coming down?

03:16.200 --> 03:17.799
Still up.

03:17.800 --> 03:19.359
Way up.

03:19.360 --> 03:23.359
This is me happy.

03:26.560 --> 03:30.439
I can't miss a disciplinary.
Dad'll flip.

03:30.440 --> 03:34.439
Be a long time dead.

04:06.920 --> 04:08.959
Freddie?

04:08.960 --> 04:12.959
Freddie, where have you been?
I was in the middle of doing your hair.

04:13.000 --> 04:13.919
Not now, Karen.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.839
But if this style goes to shit
I'll fail my feathering module!

04:16.839 --> 04:18.039
Oh! Not right now.

04:18.040 --> 04:21.319
But I never see you any more. When
are you done with that fuck-a-thon?

04:21.320 --> 04:25.319
Oh, you wanna sponsor me! That's
good cos we're saving the polar bears.

04:26.600 --> 04:30.599
I want to cut your fucking hair.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.959
Cobwebs. Got to be vigilant.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.559
Stay out of my room, Dad.

04:53.560 --> 04:55.799
So you've been busy,
saving the polar bears?

04:55.800 --> 04:57.359
Can you get out now, please?

04:57.360 --> 05:00.079
Freddie, acknowledge your father.

05:00.080 --> 05:02.079
Look, whatever the college says,
you do.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.759
No more neglecting your studies.

05:03.760 --> 05:06.319
I'm glad this young lady's
making you happy, but...

05:06.320 --> 05:07.919
No, you're not, you're jealous.

05:07.920 --> 05:11.039
What?

05:11.040 --> 05:12.279
Clean yourself up.

05:12.280 --> 05:16.279
Never thought I'd have to hide
in my own house.

05:22.720 --> 05:25.679
- Salut, etranger!
- Hello, stranger!

05:25.680 --> 05:28.159
I thought study was too 2009
for you and Effy.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.359
Where is she anyway?

05:29.360 --> 05:33.359
- She's at home. She didn't feel well.
- Trop de jiggy jig!

05:33.520 --> 05:36.679
Don't you get... bored.
Reduced to a mechanism? I mean...

05:36.680 --> 05:38.239
You just don't get it, do you, J?

05:38.240 --> 05:40.759
Well, hallelujah for that.

05:40.760 --> 05:43.679
Il y a quelqu'un pour chacun.

05:43.680 --> 05:45.719
There's someone for everyone.

05:45.720 --> 05:47.199
Right, boys, I've gotta go.

05:47.200 --> 05:50.879
I've got a meeting with Mr. Love, Interim
Educational Intervention or something.

05:50.880 --> 05:51.919
Tough Love!

05:51.920 --> 05:53.359
Le Lips is tres, tres dans le merde!

05:53.360 --> 05:55.959
I heard he power-hosed Dylan
Simpson for forging sick notes.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.959
You could plead possible sexual
OCD for interfering with your study.

06:00.320 --> 06:04.319
I'll bear that in mind, J.
See ya later.

06:07.880 --> 06:11.879
What you staring at?

06:30.360 --> 06:34.359
What are you waiting for?
Come in.

06:36.920 --> 06:40.919
Door!

06:43.560 --> 06:46.159
Frederick.

06:46.160 --> 06:47.559
It's Freddie.

06:47.560 --> 06:51.559
Why don't you sit down, Frederick?

07:00.040 --> 07:04.039
Little to the left, please.

07:08.000 --> 07:11.999
Thank you.

07:14.320 --> 07:18.319
So the history coursework,
I'm told, is late.

07:18.760 --> 07:19.799
Yes, sorry.

07:19.800 --> 07:23.359
In fact, I'm told that
everything you do is late

07:23.360 --> 07:25.279
or inadequate

07:25.280 --> 07:28.079
or both.

07:28.080 --> 07:32.079
And do you know what late
and inadequate means for you...

07:32.920 --> 07:36.919
..Frederick?

07:48.480 --> 07:51.039
That's your life.

07:51.040 --> 07:55.039
Right there.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.279
You have until Monday to
complete the missing coursework.

08:03.280 --> 08:06.439
Can you be adequate, Frederick?
Can you do that?

08:06.440 --> 08:10.439
- I can try.
- Try?

08:19.400 --> 08:20.879
What would Michael say?

08:20.880 --> 08:22.079
Pardon?

08:22.080 --> 08:24.439
Michael. What would he say?

08:24.440 --> 08:27.679
- "I'm bad."
- Yes, and what else?

08:27.680 --> 08:28.759
"Beat it"?

08:28.760 --> 08:32.759
No. He'd say,
"Gotta be starting something."

08:37.440 --> 08:41.438
OK?

08:45.440 --> 08:47.959
Don't you think you
should be leaving?

08:47.960 --> 08:49.479
Right now?

08:49.480 --> 08:53.479
Yes.

09:18.240 --> 09:22.239
Eff?

09:22.560 --> 09:26.559
Eff, are you home?

09:29.560 --> 09:33.559
Effy.

09:40.560 --> 09:44.559
Eff, what are you doing
in your mum's room?

09:55.360 --> 09:59.359
Effy.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.879
What?

10:09.880 --> 10:12.719
What is it?

10:12.720 --> 10:16.199
You've found my porn stash.

10:16.200 --> 10:17.679
Effy...

10:17.680 --> 10:20.239
To make it easier.

10:20.240 --> 10:23.479
All right, what the fuck did you take
cos you're not making any sense?

10:23.480 --> 10:24.879
Easier to accept.

10:24.880 --> 10:27.399
Accept.

10:27.400 --> 10:28.519
The end.

10:28.520 --> 10:31.519
End.

10:31.520 --> 10:35.519
What fucking end would that be?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.239
Mine...

10:37.240 --> 10:41.239
Freddie.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.439
You all right?

12:22.080 --> 12:24.999
Hunky fucking dory.

12:26.000 --> 12:29.999
Maybe just calm it down a bit, yeah?

12:32.160 --> 12:33.879
I'm not the one grinding my teeth.

12:33.880 --> 12:37.879
Both of us, for a bit. Or do you
want to fuck up your A levels?

12:46.840 --> 12:50.839
Eff, please, just drop
the dark shit, yeah?

12:53.040 --> 12:57.039
Effy, Effy, Eff, listen, all right?
OK? It's me.

12:57.320 --> 13:00.159
OK? Me.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.199
And this is me.

13:02.200 --> 13:05.079
Jesus...I thought we were happy.

13:05.080 --> 13:07.919
Too fucking happy.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.119
Right, OK, what? So you want to end it?
Is that what you're trying to say?

13:11.120 --> 13:13.559
No.

13:13.560 --> 13:17.559
It's gonna happen.

13:17.600 --> 13:21.599
Why are you head fucking me, Eff?

13:22.600 --> 13:24.359
Cos I can't handle it.

13:24.360 --> 13:28.359
Better fuck off then.

14:48.440 --> 14:49.559
Where's Josie?

14:49.560 --> 14:52.439
She's had a small breakdown.
I don't blame her.

14:52.440 --> 14:56.439
I mean look...beanbags.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.559
So, Frederick, how may I help you?

14:58.560 --> 15:00.879
It's OK, I mean, I don't
actually think you can.

15:00.880 --> 15:04.879
No, there's nothing
I cannot do, Frederick.

15:04.880 --> 15:08.879
Nothing. I guarantee it.

15:16.240 --> 15:20.239
All right.

15:25.080 --> 15:27.519
OK.

15:27.520 --> 15:31.119
So what do you do when
you can't tell anyone shit

15:31.120 --> 15:33.519
cos it might really fuck things up

15:33.520 --> 15:37.359
and you don't know what
to do or what's happening?

15:37.360 --> 15:41.359
You just know that
something really, really...

15:42.920 --> 15:46.919
...fucking bad is going down.

15:50.840 --> 15:54.839
Just...

16:12.200 --> 16:13.359
No.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.839
I think...

16:14.840 --> 16:18.839
I'm not sure...

16:20.640 --> 16:24.639
I think you've got me there.

17:30.280 --> 17:34.279
Just over there.

17:35.760 --> 17:39.039
All right, Grandad?

17:39.040 --> 17:43.039
You've gone bloody big!

17:46.360 --> 17:50.359
Give me a hand up.

17:51.200 --> 17:55.199
That Violet, she wants me
to witness her will.

17:55.880 --> 17:58.719
- Think she's up for a shag.
- Grandad!

17:58.720 --> 18:01.759
What? Get it when you can.

18:01.760 --> 18:03.479
Who's floating your boat these days?

18:03.480 --> 18:06.119
Not still chasing that Elizabeth one?

18:06.120 --> 18:08.359
No, not chasing any more.

18:08.360 --> 18:10.959
You snared her in the end then?

18:10.960 --> 18:12.439
She snared me, Grandad.

18:12.440 --> 18:16.439
Uh-oh! You'll never get
out of that headlock.

18:17.400 --> 18:18.479
I just did.

18:18.480 --> 18:22.479
Slam down! Hey, yes!

18:27.800 --> 18:31.799
Reckon we need a time-out, eh?

18:34.520 --> 18:37.519
Your mum's own miniature museum.

18:37.520 --> 18:41.519
The worse she got, the more she made.

18:41.920 --> 18:45.919
Mystifying.

18:45.960 --> 18:49.399
How's your dad these days?

18:49.400 --> 18:53.399
Better fix this young man a drink.

18:53.440 --> 18:57.439
You gonna come and tell
your grandad what's wrong?

19:07.400 --> 19:10.119
Grandad, when Mum was young,
did you know that she was ill then?

19:10.120 --> 19:14.119
The days I spent thinking on that.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.999
Maybe I did.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.519
Maybe I didn't want to.

19:19.520 --> 19:22.759
Memories play tricks.

19:22.760 --> 19:24.399
So did hospital make her worse?

19:24.400 --> 19:27.879
She did get worse in there, right?

19:27.880 --> 19:30.039
It's the chicken or the egg.

19:30.040 --> 19:33.759
You never know with the mind.

19:33.760 --> 19:35.599
The old invisible universe.

19:35.600 --> 19:39.199
We should have been the ones to look
after her, without anyone else butting in.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.399
We could have if he hadn't
have just given up.

19:41.400 --> 19:43.839
You can't blame Leo for
what happened to your mum.

19:43.840 --> 19:47.039
It's his fucking fault, Grandad.

19:47.040 --> 19:49.759
Anger will help you
survive for a while,

19:49.760 --> 19:51.919
but then it'll eat you alive.

19:51.920 --> 19:55.759
So...let it go.

19:55.760 --> 19:59.079
Living in the past will only
fuck you up, Frederigo.

19:59.080 --> 20:02.719
Pardon the Spanish.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.759
Do what you can now.

20:05.760 --> 20:09.239
Forget what wasn't done then.

20:17.720 --> 20:20.559
This is me, whoever that is.

20:20.560 --> 20:24.559
- So leave whoever a message.
- Fucking hell, Effy, pick up.

20:29.920 --> 20:33.919
Gotta stay vibed to
the world, kid, alert!

20:34.000 --> 20:37.239
I could be prizing your arse
out of your head right now.

20:37.240 --> 20:40.959
As if I've got time for this!
I've got to tell someone something.

20:40.960 --> 20:44.359
You're pretty fucked, aren't you,
mate, and so's your bike.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.639
Fuck!

21:02.400 --> 21:03.519
Freddie!

21:03.520 --> 21:07.519
Freddie! Some bloke in the kitchen
hung Anthea's pans off his knob-ring

21:09.000 --> 21:11.079
and I yanked 'em off
cos it ain't hygienic

21:11.080 --> 21:14.159
but he screamed and I can't find
first aid or Effy anywhere!

21:14.160 --> 21:15.799
Who the fuck set this up, anyway?

21:15.800 --> 21:18.039
Eff! She only posted it
about two hours ago.

21:18.040 --> 21:19.999
I am not mingling with goths.

21:20.000 --> 21:23.879
What the fuck is that?

21:23.880 --> 21:27.079
Goodbye?

21:27.080 --> 21:29.079
Where the fuck are you going, Freds?

21:29.080 --> 21:32.679
- Where is Effy?
- She ain't here, Kate.

21:32.680 --> 21:36.679
Is the hall the new kitchen
for the cool kids, or something?

21:38.880 --> 21:42.879
Panda, please don't...

21:50.040 --> 21:53.559
Bonsoir, Stonem resid... Anthea!

21:53.560 --> 21:55.519
Va bene! Va bene!

21:55.520 --> 21:58.519
"Who are you?" JJ!

21:58.520 --> 22:00.679
With the hair.

22:00.680 --> 22:01.999
Party?

22:02.000 --> 22:05.999
What's giving you that impression?

22:06.200 --> 22:07.839
She hung up.

22:07.840 --> 22:09.599
I am so leaving now.

22:09.600 --> 22:10.759
Moi aussi.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.079
Yeah, me too.

22:13.080 --> 22:17.079
Effy, can you let me in, please?

22:17.880 --> 22:21.439
Effy!

22:21.440 --> 22:25.439
Effy, can you open
this fucking door?

22:35.480 --> 22:39.479
Effy?

22:52.120 --> 22:56.119
You didn't reply.

22:57.280 --> 23:00.759
I didn't want to be on my own.

23:00.760 --> 23:04.759
Effy, what the fuck is going on?

23:14.680 --> 23:17.599
I'm sorry.

23:17.600 --> 23:21.599
I'm sorry that I shouted
at you as well.

23:34.120 --> 23:36.879
Really taking the piss this time.

23:36.880 --> 23:40.879
Yeah.

23:43.360 --> 23:45.479
Freddie, I don't want them here.

23:45.480 --> 23:49.479
I thought I did.
I thought that was me, but...

23:49.480 --> 23:52.399
I don't know what is, but...

23:52.400 --> 23:56.399
I know you're the only person
I can trust.

23:56.720 --> 24:00.679
Effy, nothing bad
is going to happen.

24:00.680 --> 24:03.959
I'm going to take care of you now.

24:03.960 --> 24:07.359
All right? I promise.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.959
I promise.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.759
Effy, I want you to stay here.

24:12.760 --> 24:14.079
OK?

24:14.080 --> 24:18.079
Stay here for me, yeah?

24:27.120 --> 24:31.119
Party's over. It's time to leave.

24:33.800 --> 24:37.799
Get the fuck out now! Move!

24:42.040 --> 24:46.039
Get out!

24:53.480 --> 24:55.479
Here.

25:00.320 --> 25:03.159
It's OK now.

25:06.640 --> 25:10.639
It's probably nothing.
Just a fox or something.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.839
- Jesus Christ!
- The one and only!

25:42.840 --> 25:46.119
You threw me a break-out party,
man. I am fucking touched.

25:46.120 --> 25:47.959
In the fucking head.
Cook, what are you playing at?

25:47.960 --> 25:50.199
I'm Bristol's most wanted.
What's the problem?

25:50.200 --> 25:53.879
You've gotta leave.

25:53.880 --> 25:55.839
What the fuck are you
doing here anyway?

25:55.840 --> 25:59.439
I couldn't hack being stuck with a
million fucking me's no more, all right?

25:59.440 --> 26:03.439
Where is she anyways?

26:04.160 --> 26:06.999
Get out.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.319
Get out!

26:08.320 --> 26:09.639
Freddie, get him out.

26:09.640 --> 26:12.519
She looks like the fucking
chick from The Ring, Freds.

26:12.520 --> 26:16.519
Wait in the shed.

27:03.240 --> 27:05.119
What the fuck's up with her?

27:05.120 --> 27:07.439
Nothing. No, everything's...

27:07.440 --> 27:10.079
- Tits up.
- No, OK? Listen.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.159
Cook, you're not coming
back here like this.

27:12.160 --> 27:16.159
I've got my own shit to solve.

27:16.240 --> 27:18.279
Please, just rest your
bony arse tight,

27:18.280 --> 27:22.279
while I go and get us
some food, all right?

27:32.840 --> 27:36.479
This is your home,
not Tesco's.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.559
Your grandad phoned last night.
He's concerned, and so am I.

27:39.560 --> 27:41.319
I'll give you the
money back for it.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.399
With what?

27:43.400 --> 27:46.639
If you want to fuck up your life, Freddie,
if that's really what you wanna do,

27:46.640 --> 27:48.559
just don't bother coming back.

27:48.560 --> 27:51.919
Fine.

27:51.920 --> 27:55.239
D'you know what, Dad? You're just
fucking angry because I've got a life.

27:55.240 --> 27:57.159
A life? You look like a dosser.

27:57.160 --> 27:59.199
You act like an animal.

27:59.200 --> 28:00.639
Who are you?

28:00.640 --> 28:03.039
Your pride and fucking joy.

28:03.040 --> 28:06.719
- If your mum could see this... - Well,
she can't, can she, thanks to you.

28:06.720 --> 28:10.719
- I was trying to fucking help her.
- She fucking killed herself, Dad.

28:14.560 --> 28:18.439
I had no choice, Freddie.

28:18.440 --> 28:20.439
Yes, you did.

28:20.440 --> 28:24.439
You could have done
something, but you didn't.

28:38.560 --> 28:42.559
Rise and shine.

28:43.800 --> 28:45.919
OK, we're gonna stop this.

28:45.920 --> 28:49.919
Right, this has to stop now.

30:18.960 --> 30:21.279
Can we go now?Where?

30:21.280 --> 30:23.479
Out.

30:23.480 --> 30:27.479
Your carriage awaits.

30:31.360 --> 30:35.239
Why the fuck did you bring me here?

30:35.240 --> 30:38.839
Just fresh air and that.

30:38.840 --> 30:42.839
Look at it.

30:45.080 --> 30:47.599
Good to get away, yeah?

30:47.600 --> 30:49.839
Yeah, good to get away.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.919
Remember, you two lovers,

31:02.920 --> 31:06.919
back by seven with
my rig, and respect.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.759
Hello! Mama's home, angel.

31:48.800 --> 31:50.559
Holy shit!

31:53.200 --> 31:54.359
Effy!

31:56.240 --> 31:59.159
I totally fucking love you.

31:59.160 --> 32:00.119
Now's the bit you say...

32:01.000 --> 32:04.679
Don't move.

32:11.360 --> 32:12.959
That one's JJ.

32:12.960 --> 32:15.599
Their faces...

32:15.600 --> 32:17.759
behind the skin...

32:17.760 --> 32:19.759
The skin?

32:19.760 --> 32:21.679
Between this world and the next...

32:25.840 --> 32:28.519
Their teeth and their claws
coming out.

32:28.520 --> 32:32.519
Trying to break through.

32:33.320 --> 32:35.359
Did you drop
something in the cab?

32:35.360 --> 32:37.719
Like a fart or something?

32:37.720 --> 32:40.479
No, like a tab or something.

32:40.480 --> 32:44.479
A tab with your face on it.

32:53.600 --> 32:54.679
Here.

32:54.680 --> 32:58.319
A hole that fits mine.

32:58.320 --> 33:00.359
The moment I saw you,

33:00.360 --> 33:04.359
I knew it'd be the closest
I'd get to being...close.

33:06.760 --> 33:10.279
I didn't know what to
do with that feeling.

33:10.280 --> 33:12.159
- Happiness.
- Listen, Effy.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.639
You are closest...
I'm ever...

33:14.640 --> 33:17.599
But they know now
and they're hungry.

33:17.600 --> 33:19.559
Really fucking hungry.

33:19.560 --> 33:23.399
Because, for as long as I know,
they've been chasing me.

33:23.400 --> 33:26.839
And now they're ready, now they're
strong enough to break through.

33:26.840 --> 33:28.999
And I can't fight them.

33:29.000 --> 33:32.999
I used to be able to
when I was strong but...

33:33.200 --> 33:35.039
You've made me weak.

33:35.040 --> 33:39.039
And now I can't, I can't.

33:39.680 --> 33:42.199
Effy, there's no-one fucking there.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.959
- Effy!
- I can't!

33:43.960 --> 33:45.039
- Effy!
- Let me go!

33:45.040 --> 33:46.719
Effy, listen.
What d'you want me to do?

33:46.720 --> 33:48.359
- They're ready now.
- Effy, stay here!

33:48.360 --> 33:51.039
- They're coming. - I'll fight 'em.
Is that going to stop you?

33:51.040 --> 33:53.439
I'll fucking fight them.

33:53.440 --> 33:55.159
Fuck off!

33:55.160 --> 33:58.919
Fuck off, you cunts,
I'll kill you all!

34:17.239 --> 34:18.559
I have to go home now.

34:18.560 --> 34:19.879
What?

34:19.880 --> 34:23.879
Get me the fuck out of here,
Freddie, please.

34:33.880 --> 34:37.879
Freddie!

34:51.719 --> 34:53.679
Shit!

34:58.000 --> 35:01.599
- Why the fuck did you bring me
here? - I didn't, I didn't know.

35:01.600 --> 35:04.919
- Fuck off!
- Oi! Come on!

35:04.920 --> 35:08.919
Get the fuck away now!

35:16.200 --> 35:18.799
Effy!

35:18.800 --> 35:22.799
Effy!

35:32.000 --> 35:34.759
Freddie! What are
you doing here?

35:34.760 --> 35:37.879
I've lost her.

35:37.880 --> 35:41.879
Come on, let's find her.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.199
Katie!

36:00.200 --> 36:04.079
Katie!

36:04.080 --> 36:08.079
Eff, come on.

36:13.360 --> 36:15.799
Freddie!

36:15.800 --> 36:19.799
Freddie!

36:37.160 --> 36:38.639
It's OK.

36:38.640 --> 36:40.559
Freddie, what's happened?
Is she all right?

36:40.560 --> 36:42.879
It's OK.

36:42.880 --> 36:46.879
Let's get her out of here.

36:51.640 --> 36:54.799
Freddie, what a lovely surprise.

36:56.440 --> 36:59.279
I didn't know where else to go.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.639
And which of you
lovely girls is Elizabeth?

37:01.640 --> 37:02.719
I'm Katie.

37:02.720 --> 37:03.999
Lovely!

37:04.000 --> 37:05.039
Sit down, Freds.

37:05.040 --> 37:06.559
No Grandad.
I've got to stay with her.

37:06.560 --> 37:08.359
It's fine. Sit down.

37:08.360 --> 37:12.359
Now, why don't you take
her to the dining hall?

37:12.400 --> 37:14.599
Where they do a
very nice cup of tea.

37:14.600 --> 37:17.599
Come on, Eff.

37:17.600 --> 37:21.439
Everything's all right.

37:21.440 --> 37:22.959
Did what I could, Grandad.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.119
I did everything.

37:24.120 --> 37:25.439
I know you did, son.

37:25.440 --> 37:26.639
But you need help.

37:26.640 --> 37:28.239
You can't take this all on yourself.

37:28.240 --> 37:31.999
I'm gonna have to, Grandad.
No-one cares. Nobody.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.599
I know that's not true.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.799
No, I don't think you do, actually.
I don't think you understand.

37:35.800 --> 37:38.879
I do. You care and
that's what's killing you.

37:38.880 --> 37:41.039
What use are you going to
be doing this to yourself?

37:41.040 --> 37:43.799
I don't give a fuck.

37:43.800 --> 37:47.679
I can't let this happen again.
I'm not gonna let this happen again.

37:47.680 --> 37:52.979
Do you have any idea how hard your dad
fought to keep your mum in this world?

37:53.160 --> 37:56.519
- He fought...
- No, he didn't.

37:56.520 --> 37:58.759
He gave her up, Grandad,
he let her do it.

37:58.760 --> 38:01.319
- No.
- Yeah.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.319
He bottled it.

38:03.320 --> 38:05.519
He fucked it up, Grandad,
we all fucked it up.

38:05.520 --> 38:09.519
No, he did the best he could, and
that's what you're going to do.

38:10.720 --> 38:14.719
You think the world
of this girl, eh?

38:15.000 --> 38:18.999
I really love her, Grandad.

38:20.640 --> 38:24.639
I can't manage without her.

38:24.680 --> 38:28.679
She's like nothing...

38:31.320 --> 38:34.239
I'm not ready to lose her yet.

38:34.240 --> 38:37.399
Do what you have to do.

38:37.400 --> 38:39.519
Just for a bit.

38:39.520 --> 38:43.079
She needs help.

38:43.080 --> 38:47.079
Live to fight another day, eh?

38:49.600 --> 38:50.879
Freddie!

38:50.880 --> 38:52.639
Effy won't come out of the toilet.

38:52.640 --> 38:54.479
What? You've left her alone?

38:54.480 --> 38:57.679
No, no, no...

38:57.680 --> 39:01.679
No, no, no...

39:05.600 --> 39:08.839
Effy, Effy...

39:13.320 --> 39:17.319
Help! Someone help!

40:32.080 --> 40:33.399
Go on.

41:33.880 --> 41:36.039
Go...

41:36.040 --> 41:40.039
Away.

42:07.600 --> 42:11.599
Before she hit the
world, she was this...

42:11.600 --> 42:14.559
Fire, heating every bit of me.

42:14.560 --> 42:18.559
It was, like, so intense, it burned.

42:18.920 --> 42:22.919
I think I knew, even then, that
she was going to be remarkable.

42:24.120 --> 42:25.359
And then...

42:25.360 --> 42:29.359
When I held her for
the first time...

42:29.560 --> 42:31.759
Man, it was like holding this...

42:31.760 --> 42:35.039
Beautiful bomb.

42:35.040 --> 42:38.839
The energy was...you know.

42:38.840 --> 42:42.839
Even then, it scared me.

42:46.720 --> 42:50.119
So I think I'm prepared for this.

42:50.120 --> 42:53.159
Whatever this is.

42:53.160 --> 42:54.919
She's going to need us.

42:54.920 --> 42:58.919
To help rebuild her again.

42:58.960 --> 43:02.959
She's going to need you.

43:52.920 --> 43:54.719
There's no future without her.

43:54.720 --> 43:58.719
Fuck the future.

44:14.400 --> 44:16.519
There's nothing any more.

44:16.520 --> 44:18.239
There's nothing but now, mate.

44:18.240 --> 44:20.759
What have I done?
What did I do?

44:20.760 --> 44:23.599
You went to the end of
the fucking earth, man.

44:23.600 --> 44:27.599
The end of the fucking earth.

44:42.960 --> 44:46.959
You're gonna have to go
further now, mate.

44:47.440 --> 44:49.839
For her.

44:49.840 --> 44:53.359
For you.

44:53.360 --> 44:57.359
For me.

45:18.920 --> 45:21.959
The radius of the event horizon
of a non-rotating black hole is?

45:21.960 --> 45:23.239
The Schwarzschild radius.

45:23.240 --> 45:25.359
Beyond that, nothing
can escape, nothing.

45:25.360 --> 45:28.079
Alien life form defined
as Lara Lloyd.

45:28.080 --> 45:32.039
The most beautiful girl in this
or any known universe.

45:32.040 --> 45:34.119
If you don't ask her out in
the next ten seconds, I will.

45:37.440 --> 45:38.519
I am a psycho.

45:38.520 --> 45:40.799
You're not a psycho.No!

45:40.800 --> 45:44.799
Lara Lloyd, would you like
to go out with me tonight?
