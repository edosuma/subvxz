WEBVTT

00:48.500 --> 00:49.700
Oh, my God, it's Jimmy!

00:49.800 --> 00:51.000
I thought you said
he was in St. Augustine.

00:51.100 --> 00:53.700
I thought he was. Go now!

00:53.700 --> 00:55.500
He'll kill you, I swear.

00:55.500 --> 00:57.200
Tina, I know
you're in there!

00:59.300 --> 01:00.300
Oh, God!

01:02.000 --> 01:03.500
Jimmy, it's not
what it looks like.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.800
Shut up!

01:05.500 --> 01:06.300
(gun cocks)

01:06.400 --> 01:09.800
Whoa! Whoa, man! Please.

01:10.900 --> 01:11.700
She said she
was single.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.300
Liar, liar!

01:13.400 --> 01:14.200
He's lying!

01:50.200 --> 01:52.300
(starter chugging)

01:52.900 --> 01:54.600
Come on! Come on!

01:55.200 --> 01:56.900
You sleep with my wife
in my house!

01:58.200 --> 01:59.100
(cocks gun)

01:59.200 --> 02:01.700
(propeller chugging)

02:25.800 --> 02:28.100
(indistinct radio transmission)

02:39.000 --> 02:40.400
Did you get an ID, Alex?

02:40.400 --> 02:42.400
No, I pulled him

02:42.500 --> 02:44.000
from under that
boat, Horatio.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.600
Extensive propeller damage.

02:45.600 --> 02:47.200
It took part
of his leg.

02:47.300 --> 02:50.300
CAINE:
What about you,
you get anything, Frank?

02:51.300 --> 02:52.900
Witnesses don't know
who he is either.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.400
They seem reliable, Frank?

02:54.500 --> 02:55.900
Maybe for now.

02:58.300 --> 02:59.500
Alex?

02:59.600 --> 03:01.100
We won't be able
to fingerprint him.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.600
Hands and fingers are pruned.

03:03.700 --> 03:06.300
The injuries from the boat
appear to be postmortem.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.400
I think he was dead
before he met that propeller.

03:10.500 --> 03:12.700
CAINE:
That means somebody dumped him.

03:12.800 --> 03:14.100
Poor guy.

03:14.200 --> 03:15.200
Just thrown away like garbage.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.400
Who would do that?

03:16.500 --> 03:19.300
Somebody who has no regard
for life.

03:42.300 --> 03:45.600
* We don't get fooled again *

03:45.600 --> 03:49.800
* Don't get fooled again *

04:19.000 --> 04:19.700
Excuse me.

04:21.100 --> 04:22.200
I'm looking
for the morgue.

04:23.100 --> 04:25.300
Uh, what's the name
of the deceased?

04:25.300 --> 04:26.800
Actually, I'm here
to apply for a job.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.800
Oh, you're looking
for Human Resources.

04:28.900 --> 04:29.900
All right, uh, look...

04:30.000 --> 04:31.900
Nick?

04:33.100 --> 04:34.600
Natalia.

04:34.700 --> 04:36.900
Oh, I was hoping
I'd run into you.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.300
You two know
each other?

04:39.400 --> 04:40.200
Yeah.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.400
Uh, could you just, could you
just give us a sec?

04:43.400 --> 04:45.800
Please?
Yeah.

04:47.700 --> 04:49.500
I don't know how
the hell you got
out of jail.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.600
Early release.

04:50.700 --> 04:52.100
You were my first stop.

04:52.200 --> 04:53.500
But they're supposed
to tell me.

04:53.600 --> 04:55.000
I guess your little group
doesn't know everything.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.800
I want you, I want you
out of here.

04:56.800 --> 04:57.800
Look, Nat, I am just...

04:57.900 --> 05:00.300
I'm just here
to get a job.

05:00.300 --> 05:02.000
Ad online
for body-hauler.

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
I still have
a restraining order

05:03.000 --> 05:04.400
and I can have you
put right back in.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.400
Expired.

05:05.900 --> 05:08.800
I checked.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.200
You are not
going to do
this to me.

05:11.200 --> 05:13.000
You're not going
to do this to me.

05:13.100 --> 05:14.400
Get out of here!

05:22.100 --> 05:23.500
Who was that guy?

05:23.600 --> 05:27.700
My husband.
My ex-husband.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.400
I better go talk
to Human Resources

05:29.400 --> 05:31.800
to make sure they
don't hire him.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.300
This the vic
from the marina?

05:39.300 --> 05:42.200
(sighs):
Still trying
to get ID.

05:42.300 --> 05:45.500
So far no luck.

05:45.500 --> 05:49.400
All I know is baby boy
met a terrible end.

05:49.500 --> 05:51.100
Does he look
familiar to you.

05:51.100 --> 05:52.400
No.

05:53.400 --> 05:54.200
Should he?

05:54.200 --> 05:54.900
I don't know.

05:54.900 --> 05:57.200
I just feel like I've seen
him somewhere before.

05:57.300 --> 05:58.800
I heard that the boat
didn't kill him.

05:58.800 --> 05:59.900
You know what did?

05:59.900 --> 06:01.400
A different kind
of vehicle.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.300
Massive head trauma,

06:03.400 --> 06:06.400
leg and arm fractures,
all at different levels.

06:06.500 --> 06:07.900
He was hit by a car.

06:14.500 --> 06:17.200
And that explains
all of the bruising
on his torso.

06:17.300 --> 06:20.500
Mm-hmm. His heart
continued to beat

06:20.500 --> 06:23.100
after his brain activity
ceased.

06:23.100 --> 06:26.300
Must have been
a brutal impact.

06:26.400 --> 06:30.200
How do you suppose
he ended up in the water?

06:30.300 --> 06:32.500
No idea, but maybe
this will tell us.

06:32.600 --> 06:34.000
What is it?

06:34.100 --> 06:35.900
Looks like plastic.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.200
Or some kind of
electrical component.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.400
I'll take it Trace,
see what we come up with.

06:41.900 --> 06:43.200
All yours.

06:43.900 --> 06:44.700
Thanks.

06:54.500 --> 06:56.700
I heard you found something
in our vic's leg.

06:56.700 --> 06:57.500
Any idea what?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.600
Seems to be some sort
of electrical device

06:59.600 --> 07:02.800
which happens to be
covered in ethylene glycol,

07:02.900 --> 07:04.300
aka auto coolant.

07:04.400 --> 07:05.600
So it's part
of the air-conditioning.

07:05.600 --> 07:08.300
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe
the automotive thermometer.

07:08.400 --> 07:10.300
All right. Luckily,
we have a database.

07:11.100 --> 07:13.700
If we can't ID the victim,
at least we can ID the car.

07:27.900 --> 07:29.900
(tires squeal, crash sound)

07:34.600 --> 07:36.800
(dog barking)

07:36.800 --> 07:39.800
DELKO:
Bob Norwood, Miami-Dade PD.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.300
Easy, girl. Easy.

07:53.600 --> 07:55.100
Can I help you?

07:55.100 --> 07:57.000
CAINE:
Is this the car
you towed in this morning?

07:57.100 --> 07:59.300
Like I said on the phone,
I picked her up before dawn.

07:59.400 --> 08:00.400
Who called it in?

08:00.500 --> 08:01.700
Nobody.

08:01.800 --> 08:04.900
She's a dead head;
abandoned car.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.200
Find her, she's yours.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.000
Have a look, Eric.

08:08.800 --> 08:09.800
Is there a problem?

08:09.800 --> 08:13.200
Yes, it may have been used
in a felony hit-and-run.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.100
Really?

08:18.200 --> 08:19.700
Definitely.

08:19.700 --> 08:21.100
There's a piece of skin here.

08:21.100 --> 08:23.500
It looks like it's from a scalp.

08:23.600 --> 08:24.600
It's a shock to me.

08:31.300 --> 08:33.700
We got some kind of substance
on the driver-side door.

08:33.700 --> 08:34.900
I'll get it
to the lab.

08:40.400 --> 08:42.500
And then there's this.

08:44.500 --> 08:46.600
I'll bag it
and get it to Trace.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.900
You never contacted
the registered owner.

08:50.200 --> 08:52.300
Matter of fact,
I was just about to.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.300
Car's leased
to a Jason Hollings,

08:55.300 --> 08:58.400
a company called J.A. Models.

08:58.500 --> 08:59.900
CAINE:
Where'd you pick it up?

09:00.000 --> 09:01.800
1400 block of Lincoln.

09:01.800 --> 09:03.800
Thank you very much.

09:03.900 --> 09:06.100
DELKO:
All right, I think
I'll head over to Lincoln.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.700
That could be our primary
crime scene.

09:07.800 --> 09:10.300
And I will take a look
at Mr. Hollings.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.800
So, Mr. Hollings,

09:12.800 --> 09:14.700
you drive
a black Mercedes convertible.

09:14.700 --> 09:16.600
Sure do.
It's a bad ride.

09:16.700 --> 09:18.400
My agency leases it for me.

09:18.400 --> 09:19.300
J.A. Models?

09:19.400 --> 09:20.700
Exactly. I'm a model.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.500
What, you don't recognize me?

09:28.600 --> 09:29.600
Afraid not.

09:29.600 --> 09:31.100
Eh, you will.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.400
I'm about to bust out.

09:32.500 --> 09:34.200
I could be Cole Haus's
newest face.

09:34.200 --> 09:35.500
Speaking of new faces,

09:35.600 --> 09:37.700
Frank, why don't you
show him that one?

09:41.200 --> 09:42.700
Whoa.

09:44.600 --> 09:45.400
That's Steve.

09:45.500 --> 09:46.500
Steve who?

09:46.500 --> 09:48.000
Dixon.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.800
Both repped by J.A.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.400
What happened to him?

09:52.500 --> 09:54.400
He was hit by a car,
Mr. Hollings,

09:54.500 --> 09:55.900
and is currently dead.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.100
No way.

09:57.200 --> 09:59.300
Way.
And your car did the damage.

09:59.400 --> 10:01.400
We also found
a red sticky substance

10:01.400 --> 10:02.800
on the driver's side door--

10:02.900 --> 10:05.600
energy drink mixed
with an over-the-counter steroid;

10:05.700 --> 10:07.800
androstenedione.

10:07.900 --> 10:09.400
Yeah, that was Steve's thing.

10:09.500 --> 10:10.700
He was a 'roid head.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.600
He must have spilled
it in my car, man.

10:13.600 --> 10:15.900
I gave my car to
Steve last night.

10:15.900 --> 10:17.700
So you were with Steve
last night.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.700
Yeah, a photo shoot.

10:19.700 --> 10:21.200
Said he wanted
to see his lady after.

10:21.300 --> 10:22.600
Didn't have transpo,
let him use mine.

10:22.700 --> 10:23.900
Give us the name
of his girlfriend.

10:25.400 --> 10:26.700
Well, I do that,
I could lose my job.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.000
You don't,

10:28.100 --> 10:29.800
and you're going
to lose everything.

10:43.100 --> 10:46.300
Do you recognize this man,
Miss Biggs?

10:46.400 --> 10:49.200
Oh, my God, it's Steve.

10:49.200 --> 10:51.200
I just can't believe this.

10:52.600 --> 10:56.600
CAINE:
I understand
that there was a relationship.

10:56.700 --> 10:58.100
Business relationship.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.000
We found these in a car

11:00.100 --> 11:01.600
that was leased to one
of your clients--

11:01.700 --> 11:02.900
Jason Hollings.

11:03.000 --> 11:04.400
Jason's car?

11:04.400 --> 11:07.700
Jason loaned Steve his car
to come and see you.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.100
That's crazy.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.700
Okay, well, in that case,

11:10.700 --> 11:13.300
we're going
to need a DNA sample from you.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.200
Okay, fine. They're mine.

11:18.300 --> 11:20.100
But not from
last night.

11:20.200 --> 11:22.400
I've been seeing
Steve for months.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.300
But please, please,
don't tell my partner.

11:24.300 --> 11:25.400
She'll kill me.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.200
Why would she do that?

11:27.200 --> 11:29.000
Janet and I
have a rule--

11:29.100 --> 11:31.100
No getting involved
with the talent.

11:31.200 --> 11:33.900
And you, uh...
you broke that rule.

11:33.900 --> 11:36.500
Yes. I've been
sleeping with Steve.

11:37.100 --> 11:39.300
(voice breaks):
Promise me you won't tell Janet.

11:39.300 --> 11:41.800
Ma'am, this is
a homicide investigation.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.200
We also found trace

11:43.300 --> 11:46.300
of a performance-enhancing
hormone in the car.

11:46.400 --> 11:48.400
Was the victim
on steroids?

11:48.500 --> 11:49.600
Absolutely not.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.100
Steve was allergic.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.100
Steroids would have killed him.

11:53.100 --> 11:57.600
Was there any reason
Jason would want Steve dead?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.100
They're models.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.500
They all want
to kill each other.

12:07.800 --> 12:11.000
This is where the car
was towed from, right here.

12:11.000 --> 12:14.000
DELKO:
All right, we just...
we need the point of impact.

12:14.000 --> 12:16.500
???

12:17.200 --> 12:19.500
Possibly brake marks?

12:23.000 --> 12:25.200
They're darker at the inception.

12:25.200 --> 12:26.600
Rubber sloughs off,

12:26.600 --> 12:28.700
means the driver
was accelerating.

12:31.900 --> 12:35.200
Whoever was driving that car
definitely wanted Dixon dead.

12:36.500 --> 12:37.800
Steve carry a cell phone?

12:37.900 --> 12:39.800
He's a model.
He probably lived on one.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.300
Jackpot. Camera phone.

12:52.800 --> 12:56.100
Well, well.
Look who's out of the lab.

12:56.200 --> 12:57.700
What the hell are
you doing here, Nick?

12:57.800 --> 12:59.800
Bought myself
a scanner.

12:59.900 --> 13:01.500
Keep up on all
the hot crime scenes.
It's stalking.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.800
I'm just looking for work
in the private sector.

13:03.900 --> 13:05.100
You barred me from County.

13:05.100 --> 13:07.300
You went to prison
for breaking my arm.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.900
A man can change.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.000
Not you, Nick.

13:18.100 --> 13:19.800
Come on, Nat, let's
just hug it out.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.100
Stay away from me.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.300
Just stay away from me!

13:23.400 --> 13:24.500
Hey! Hey.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.100
Check the perimeter
for debris.

13:27.100 --> 13:28.500
You're inside a crime scene.

13:28.600 --> 13:29.900
You need to leave.

13:31.900 --> 13:33.600
Oh, I get it.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.400
She slept with you.

13:35.400 --> 13:37.400
Right. Am I right?

13:38.600 --> 13:40.200
You and about
a hundred other guys.

13:40.300 --> 13:41.600
Get the hell out of here.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.600
She got something
from you, didn't she?

13:43.700 --> 13:45.800
That's her style.
Tit for tat.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.100
You got about two seconds.

13:47.200 --> 13:48.700
You want
my advice?

13:48.800 --> 13:51.400
Run. Run from this chick.

13:51.500 --> 13:53.700
You got no idea who she is.

14:15.650 --> 14:16.450
Hey.

14:17.650 --> 14:20.250
I heard you had
an unwelcome visitor today.

14:21.050 --> 14:21.950
Eric.

14:22.650 --> 14:24.450
He's just concerned about
you, and you know what?

14:24.550 --> 14:26.150
Quite frankly, so am I.
What's going on?

14:29.050 --> 14:30.750
It's not good.

14:31.750 --> 14:32.850
You want to talk about it?

14:34.950 --> 14:36.550
I'm terrified of him, Calleigh.

14:36.650 --> 14:38.350
And he's capable
of anything.

14:38.450 --> 14:39.250
And you know
what's even crazier

14:39.250 --> 14:39.950
is that my therapist thinks

14:39.950 --> 14:41.750
this is some kind
of suppressed attraction.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.850
What do you think it is?

14:45.050 --> 14:47.750
I don't know.

14:47.850 --> 14:49.950
I don't know, but
I just want to kill him.

14:51.450 --> 14:52.650
I can understand that...

14:54.050 --> 14:56.050
but you might not want
to say it out loud.

14:57.950 --> 15:00.050
That's good advice.
Thank you.

15:00.150 --> 15:00.950
Well, I've

15:00.950 --> 15:03.250
I've got no
distinguishable prints.

15:03.250 --> 15:04.650
What about you? Have
you got anything?

15:05.150 --> 15:06.350
Matter of fact, I do.

15:06.350 --> 15:08.250
Our victim Steve
was carrying this.

15:08.250 --> 15:11.150
And this is
a MicroSD memory card.

15:11.150 --> 15:13.850
Powered by a 1.2 megahertz cell,

15:13.950 --> 15:16.850
and it carries
200 high-resolution photos.

15:16.850 --> 15:18.750
Well, I would say
that's something.

15:18.850 --> 15:21.550
I'll take this to AV
if you don't mind.

15:21.650 --> 15:24.050
I'm going to check
on you later, okay?

15:24.050 --> 15:26.850
I appreciate that. Really.

15:37.750 --> 15:40.050
These are the photos
I downloaded from the phone.

15:40.150 --> 15:42.350
Well, it definitely belonged
to Steve Dixon.

15:42.350 --> 15:43.850
Must have flown out of his hand
when he got hit.

15:52.050 --> 15:54.350
It's a freaky thing,
but the photo capture button

15:54.450 --> 15:55.750
looks like
it got jammed.

15:57.650 --> 16:00.650
Maybe he caught our driver.

16:00.750 --> 16:02.350
Or a witness.

16:02.450 --> 16:04.150
That last shot.

16:04.250 --> 16:05.450
Can you get any closer?

16:05.550 --> 16:06.750
As close as you want.

16:06.850 --> 16:08.850
There are no plates.

16:08.950 --> 16:10.550
What's that
on the bumper?

16:10.550 --> 16:11.750
Some kind of sticker.

16:13.950 --> 16:14.950
Here, Let me
enhance it.

16:18.650 --> 16:20.050
"Danger.
Exotic animals

16:20.150 --> 16:21.250
on board."

16:21.250 --> 16:22.250
What would an animal
truck be doing

16:22.250 --> 16:23.350
at the scene of a murder?

16:26.250 --> 16:28.450
JANET:
I'm in the middle of a cattle call,

16:28.550 --> 16:29.650
and Abby's not here.

16:29.650 --> 16:32.450
WOLFE:Do you have any idea
where she is, Janet?

16:32.450 --> 16:36.050
Personal time. She's traumatized
over the loss of her boyfriend.

16:36.050 --> 16:37.950
So you knew about Abby
and Steve Dixon?

16:37.950 --> 16:39.750
It may be called
J.A. Models,

16:39.850 --> 16:41.750
but I am the head
of this agency.

16:41.850 --> 16:43.750
I know everything
that goes on around here.

16:44.950 --> 16:46.250
Everything.

16:46.350 --> 16:48.250
Great. Because
we're going to need

16:48.250 --> 16:50.450
to know everything
about Steve Dixon's life.

16:50.550 --> 16:52.550
Everything.

16:54.650 --> 16:55.450
This photo

16:55.550 --> 16:56.650
was taken
on the street

16:56.750 --> 16:58.550
right before
Steve was mowed down.

16:58.650 --> 17:01.150
Any chance that truck
was following him?

17:01.250 --> 17:04.450
Bumper sticker says that truck
houses exotic animals.

17:04.550 --> 17:06.650
Would a tiger count?

17:06.750 --> 17:08.150
A tiger?

17:08.250 --> 17:11.150
Well, what did Steve Dixon
have to do with a tiger?

17:11.150 --> 17:13.250
He was attacked by one
on a photo shoot.

17:13.349 --> 17:14.950
Animal Control
destroyed the cat.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.150
The trainer took it very hard.

17:18.650 --> 17:20.050
Looks like our trainer
just went

17:20.050 --> 17:22.050
from witness to accomplice.

17:25.450 --> 17:27.250
(growling)

17:40.650 --> 17:42.550
That scratch was nothing.

17:42.550 --> 17:43.850
They made me put Veena down.

17:43.850 --> 17:45.950
So you and Dixon
had an ax to grind?

17:45.950 --> 17:47.650
Thought you'd put him down?

17:47.750 --> 17:50.450
We have evidence that puts you
at the scene of a hit-and-run.

17:50.450 --> 17:52.350
Your truck was in
a cell phone picture,

17:52.350 --> 17:53.750
taken right before
Steven died.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.650
Look, I was following Steve,
but not to hurt him.

17:56.650 --> 17:58.050
<i>To prove he wasn't hurt.</i>

17:58.050 --> 17:59.450
I'm not
following you.

17:59.550 --> 18:01.550
Dixon sued. I had
to pay 500 grand

18:01.550 --> 18:03.550
for a leg injury
that didn't exist.

18:03.650 --> 18:05.150
He said he couldn't do runway,

18:05.150 --> 18:06.850
but he was running
when I saw him.

18:06.950 --> 18:07.850
What was he running from?

18:07.950 --> 18:09.550
Some Mercedes.

18:09.550 --> 18:10.650
Why did you leave the scene?

18:11.850 --> 18:13.250
I didn't want to get involved.

18:13.250 --> 18:14.450
Well, now you are.

18:20.250 --> 18:24.750
Francis, we have
a disconnection.

18:24.750 --> 18:26.450
The location where
our victim was hit

18:26.550 --> 18:29.050
was not where we recovered
his body, was it?

18:29.150 --> 18:30.950
No, it wasn't. You're right.

18:31.050 --> 18:32.950
Body's got to get
from point A to point B.

18:32.950 --> 18:35.350
So how did the body travel?

18:39.250 --> 18:40.950
Calleigh? Yes.

18:40.950 --> 18:42.350
I need you to go to the beach.

18:49.850 --> 18:51.450
So, we're looking
at Biscayne Bay

18:51.450 --> 18:54.250
between Bicentennial
Park and Coral Gables.

18:54.750 --> 18:57.850
Show me on the map where
Steve Dixon's body was found.

18:57.950 --> 19:01.850
Well, that would be
Biscayne Harbor.

19:01.950 --> 19:03.750
Bay Tide Marina.

19:03.750 --> 19:05.350
Boat slip number ten.

19:05.450 --> 19:07.050
It's nice real estate.

19:07.050 --> 19:09.250
Well, not if you're Steve Dixon.

19:10.250 --> 19:12.150
Hey, what have you got on current
ocean conditions?

19:12.650 --> 19:13.550
Hmm.

19:15.350 --> 19:16.550
Surf is weak.

19:16.550 --> 19:20.550
Today's current's flowing south
from Miami River to the Gulf.

19:20.650 --> 19:22.450
So those currents
weren't strong enough

19:22.450 --> 19:24.650
for Dixon to have drifted
into the marina.

19:24.650 --> 19:26.750
So that narrows
our drop point to the beach

19:26.750 --> 19:28.850
between Biscayne Harbor
and the river.

19:29.150 --> 19:30.650
So we just need
to find the shortest distance

19:30.650 --> 19:31.650
between two points.

19:31.650 --> 19:34.250
Hit-and-run was here.

19:34.350 --> 19:37.550
This happens to be right
by Coral Sands Beach.

19:39.050 --> 19:39.950
Really?

19:41.450 --> 19:44.150
Well, that may be all we need
to solve Steve Dixon's murder.

19:46.250 --> 19:48.150
Yeah, these are
from this morning's beach shoot.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.750
At Bayside, but we're
more interested

19:49.850 --> 19:51.350
in what happened at
Coral Sands Beach.

19:51.850 --> 19:53.850
It seems that in this
case there's a reason

19:53.850 --> 19:55.750
why they call
them proof sheets.

19:58.150 --> 19:59.650
Not bad.

19:59.650 --> 20:00.950
Yeah, they really
feature my face.

20:00.950 --> 20:02.250
And your feet.

20:03.650 --> 20:05.650
Take your shoes off, please.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.550
What are you going
to take off for me?

20:07.650 --> 20:11.150
Take you shoes off,
and put your foot on the table.

20:17.950 --> 20:20.450
(slight groan)

20:24.650 --> 20:26.450
You cut your foot on the coral

20:26.550 --> 20:27.950
when you dumped
Steve Dixon's body.

20:29.150 --> 20:30.350
We checked the
spot in between

20:30.350 --> 20:32.650
where Steve was hit and
where the body was recovered.

20:32.650 --> 20:34.650
There was blood on the coral.
We're testing it now.

20:49.850 --> 20:51.450
You know, you said
Steve was driving.

20:51.550 --> 20:52.750
I want the truth, Hollings.

20:55.750 --> 20:57.750
(heavy sigh)

21:00.450 --> 21:02.350
Okay...

21:02.350 --> 21:03.850
Steve and I were going
to the shoot.

21:04.850 --> 21:06.050
Yeah, I was at the wheel.

21:10.850 --> 21:12.450
Dude, I think I hit
something back there.

21:13.150 --> 21:14.350
You want to
check the front?

21:14.450 --> 21:15.650
Yeah.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.750
I'm on it, bro.

21:28.850 --> 21:30.650
It's not fair.

21:30.750 --> 21:33.650
<i>Cover of Ocean Drive--
that was mine, but he got it.</i>

21:33.750 --> 21:35.850
The agency stopped
sending me out.

21:35.950 --> 21:37.650
The "go sees,"
the big interviews.

21:37.750 --> 21:40.250
They sent him, because
he was sleeping with Abby.

21:40.350 --> 21:42.250
so you fix that.

21:48.050 --> 21:49.250
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

21:49.350 --> 21:52.850
What the hell, dude!
Dude, watch it!

21:57.150 --> 22:00.250
(thudding)

22:02.050 --> 22:04.050
(tires squealing)

22:06.250 --> 22:07.250
(tires squealing)

22:07.350 --> 22:09.950
<i>JASON:Then I threw him
in the back seat.</i>

22:13.350 --> 22:14.450
So, I'm sorry...

22:15.950 --> 22:17.550
You killed him
for a modeling job?

22:17.550 --> 22:19.050
I was the one.

22:19.150 --> 22:20.750
I had the cheek implants
in Mexico.

22:20.750 --> 22:21.850
I did the steroids.

22:26.050 --> 22:27.650
I risked my life
for this look.

22:28.650 --> 22:29.750
i think you are going to take

22:29.750 --> 22:31.450
a fantastic booking photo.

22:38.850 --> 22:42.350
(phone ringing)

22:44.350 --> 22:46.450
Judge Chambers.

22:46.550 --> 22:48.250
To what do I owe this honor?

22:50.850 --> 22:52.450
Yeah, um, well,
she's a coworker.

22:52.450 --> 22:53.950
I'd really rather not
get involved.

22:56.650 --> 22:57.550
Okay.

22:58.350 --> 22:59.650
All right, I'll be right there.

23:01.850 --> 23:04.150
(sighs)

23:08.950 --> 23:13.450
H. Listen,
uh, I've got a problem.

23:23.650 --> 23:25.050
Horatio, you wanted
to talk to me?

23:25.950 --> 23:26.750
Yeah.

23:27.550 --> 23:30.150
Eric has just been over
to see Judge Chambers.

23:30.850 --> 23:31.350
Why?

23:31.350 --> 23:32.650
It seems that
your ex-husband

23:32.650 --> 23:35.350
has filed a temporary
restraining order on you

23:35.350 --> 23:37.150
and has named
Eric as a witness.

23:45.150 --> 23:48.950
You know, this... this is...
this is what he does, Horatio.

23:48.950 --> 23:49.650
This is what he does--

23:49.650 --> 23:51.750
he comes in and he wrecks
everything.

23:51.750 --> 23:53.350
I understand.
No, you don't understand.

23:53.350 --> 23:54.750
He really wants to hurt me

23:54.750 --> 23:56.150
and he's just waiting
for the chance.

23:56.150 --> 23:58.750
Ms. Boa Vista, it's not going
to happen this time.

24:07.150 --> 24:09.750
(phone ringing)

24:25.750 --> 24:26.450
BOA VISTA:
Hey, good news.

24:26.450 --> 24:28.550
Just closed this case.
Calleigh got a confession.

24:28.550 --> 24:29.450
All that's left

24:29.450 --> 24:31.450
is to release
the body to the family.

24:31.450 --> 24:33.650
Well, guess what,
it all begins again.

24:34.650 --> 24:35.250
What do you mean?

24:35.250 --> 24:36.150
I just got a call

24:36.150 --> 24:38.250
from Dade PD. They said they
found another dead model.

24:39.450 --> 24:41.450
You are kidding. Where?

24:41.450 --> 24:43.650
Down by the beach.
I'll fill you in on the way.

24:54.150 --> 24:55.050
BOA VISTA:
What's his name?

24:58.050 --> 25:00.750
ID says Cody Lane.

25:04.950 --> 25:06.350
Wow.

25:06.350 --> 25:09.850
modeling is suddenly the most dangrous job in miami.

25:23.050 --> 25:24.050
Think he fell?

25:25.750 --> 25:27.150
Or was pushed.

25:30.650 --> 25:31.850
I vote pushed.

25:31.850 --> 25:33.650
Seems too far
from the building.

25:34.350 --> 25:36.550
Yeah, the horizontal distance
does appear pretty wide.

25:38.250 --> 25:40.250
I'll call Ryan and we'll
get the UV camera

25:40.250 --> 25:42.850
to see if he was
pushed or jumped.
Sorry I'm late.

25:43.450 --> 25:44.750
BOA VISTA:Do you mind if I just
have a word with you

25:44.750 --> 25:45.250
for a sec?

25:47.050 --> 25:48.350
Heard you talked to Chambers.

25:48.650 --> 25:49.450
Thanks a lot.

25:49.450 --> 25:50.850
Look, I just told him
what I saw.

25:50.850 --> 25:53.050
That's exactly what he
wanted you to do.

25:53.050 --> 25:54.550
This isn't the time
or the place.

25:56.350 --> 25:57.050
Okay.

25:58.050 --> 25:59.350
So how do we know
which balcony?

26:01.650 --> 26:03.350
We go old school.
Which is what?

26:03.350 --> 26:04.850
We knock and talk.

26:23.750 --> 26:26.350
Yeah... he was
definitely pushed.

26:28.350 --> 26:31.550
Looks like Cody here
had a very, very bad day.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.450
WOODS:
What's that, Ryan?

26:35.150 --> 26:36.350
It's an obstruction.

26:36.450 --> 26:37.650
I don't know,
it's jewelry?

26:37.750 --> 26:40.050
But it kind of looks
to big to be a ring.

26:40.150 --> 26:41.150
You know, we should check
the rest of him

26:41.150 --> 26:42.750
just to make sure
there's no more bruising.

26:47.650 --> 26:50.650
Whoa.

26:50.650 --> 26:53.050
Looks like Cody didn't have
such a bad day after all.

26:53.150 --> 26:54.850
There's, uh...
there's lipstick.

26:55.450 --> 26:58.450
Little Cody's got a little ring
around the collar.

27:03.150 --> 27:06.950
Ran the sample from the current
model's private area.

27:07.050 --> 27:09.150
Does it match any
woman in the system?

27:09.250 --> 27:13.950
No, but it does match a woman
in our investigation.

27:18.150 --> 27:20.650
Turns out your partner's
not the only one

27:20.750 --> 27:24.150
w's, uh...
sleeping with the help.

27:27.650 --> 27:28.850
Found your DNA

27:30.650 --> 27:32.150
on Cody Lane's body.

27:32.750 --> 27:35.650
Last time I checked,
sex was legal.

27:35.750 --> 27:37.650
Means nothing.

27:40.150 --> 27:41.450
(voice echoing):
What's the matter, baby?

27:43.550 --> 27:45.450
I've just been
so stressed.

27:46.450 --> 27:49.850
Well, I think I can
help with that.

27:53.050 --> 27:54.550
It means you were with him
when he died.

27:54.550 --> 27:56.450
I was with him this morning.

27:56.850 --> 28:00.850
And believe me, when I left him,
things were looking... up.

28:07.050 --> 28:08.350
You want to give me
the room number

28:08.450 --> 28:09.750
where you had your little
rendezvous?

28:09.950 --> 28:11.750
9-9-5.

28:12.150 --> 28:13.350
Can I go now?

28:13.450 --> 28:14.850
Don't go far.

28:14.950 --> 28:16.550
I wouldn't
dream of it.

28:16.650 --> 28:17.650
And by the way...

28:17.750 --> 28:21.450
that, uh,
look is so last season.

28:24.850 --> 28:27.050
Hey, Delko.
I got the room number.

28:38.050 --> 28:40.450
Apparently the owner loaned
the place out

28:40.450 --> 28:42.250
for a high-fashion
photo shoot.

28:42.550 --> 28:45.450
So it could have been
a lot of people out here on this balcony.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.750
Yeah. Let's find the one
that doesn't fit.

28:57.850 --> 29:00.150
I got something.

29:00.250 --> 29:02.050
This might help us out.

29:16.650 --> 29:18.850
Hair.

29:18.950 --> 29:19.850
It's short and bowed.

29:19.950 --> 29:21.350
Rules out our two ladies.

29:24.650 --> 29:25.750
It's banded.

29:25.850 --> 29:26.750
You thinking animal?

29:26.850 --> 29:28.550
I think it's a tiger.

29:28.650 --> 29:30.350
I'll get it to the lab.
Okay.

29:33.550 --> 29:35.950
Get out of here right now.
This is my crime scene.

29:35.950 --> 29:37.250
Mine, too.

29:37.350 --> 29:39.750
Crime scene cleanup.

29:39.850 --> 29:42.350
Private. Not a county job.

29:42.350 --> 29:44.250
Well, you're early, okay?

29:44.350 --> 29:47.050
Crime scene cleanup doesn't come
in until after we're finished.

29:47.050 --> 29:49.250
Sorry. New guy enthusiasm.

29:49.250 --> 29:50.750
But, hey,
since I'm here,

29:50.750 --> 29:52.350
she's got to go.

29:52.350 --> 29:55.250
A temporary restraining order. You gotta keep 100 feet away from me.

29:55.850 --> 29:57.450
In case you lose control again.

29:58.450 --> 29:59.750
Is this real?

29:59.850 --> 30:01.950
I don't really have
to leave, do I?

30:02.050 --> 30:04.150
Until we figure it out.

30:06.150 --> 30:08.650
Just go.

30:12.150 --> 30:13.750
A hundred feet.

30:16.550 --> 30:17.550
Hey, thanks for
having my back.

30:17.650 --> 30:18.750
I don't have your back.

30:26.050 --> 30:28.950
Was I right, tiger?
Maybe not.

30:29.050 --> 30:31.450
Take a look.
The scale structure's flat.

30:34.850 --> 30:37.050
Imbricate.

30:37.150 --> 30:39.850
Cuticle from a tiger
is spinuous, petal-like.

30:39.950 --> 30:43.550
Most common animal to have an
imbricate cuticle's a dog.

30:54.750 --> 30:55.950
A dog hair?

30:55.950 --> 30:58.150
Right in the middle
of a crime scene.

30:59.350 --> 31:00.650
Well...

31:00.850 --> 31:03.250
you're going to have to talk
to her about that,

31:03.350 --> 31:04.750
'cause I... I'm innocent.

31:06.750 --> 31:09.050
Do you always hold
your keys like that?

31:12.350 --> 31:13.850
Yeah, so?

31:13.850 --> 31:16.950
Those keys prove
you killed Cody Lane.

31:39.450 --> 31:41.150
I've got a little girl
with leukemia.

31:43.050 --> 31:44.850
She's in the hospital.

31:46.150 --> 31:47.950
I don't have health insurance.

31:48.050 --> 31:50.250
So you needed the money.

31:52.050 --> 31:53.750
My wife stays with her
up at...

31:55.050 --> 31:56.350
Johns Hopkins.

31:56.650 --> 31:58.150
It costs a fortune.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.550
Who put you up to it?

31:59.650 --> 32:00.650
I can't talk about that.

32:00.650 --> 32:02.150
You mean you won't talk
to me about it.

32:02.150 --> 32:05.550
No. If I want her to continue
getting treatment,

32:05.950 --> 32:07.050
I can't talk about it.

32:07.150 --> 32:08.650
Suit yourself, my friend.

32:08.750 --> 32:10.450
Hook him up, please.

32:10.450 --> 32:13.550
(phone ringing)

32:13.650 --> 32:16.450
Yes. Mr. Wolfe,
we have a problem.

32:16.550 --> 32:19.350
Let me guess--
the tow man isn't talking.

32:19.450 --> 32:20.750
Yes. He killed
Cody Lane.

32:20.850 --> 32:22.850
I need to find out
who put him up to it.

32:22.950 --> 32:24.350
You got any tips?

32:24.450 --> 32:26.450
Mr. Wolfe, follow the money.

32:37.550 --> 32:38.250
Ian...

32:38.750 --> 32:40.350
Did you look in
those accounting records?

32:40.350 --> 32:41.150
I did.

32:41.250 --> 32:42.650
Great. What'd you get?

32:42.650 --> 32:44.450
Well, my search
through the books for the tow truck

32:44.550 --> 32:46.750
driver's money leads back
to Steve Dixon.

32:46.750 --> 32:49.950
Steve Dixon? We already
found his killer.

32:50.050 --> 32:52.650
So we only wasted
about a half a day.

32:52.650 --> 32:54.550
Not necessarily.

32:54.550 --> 32:56.850
Remember how Dixon
was mauled by a tiger?

32:56.950 --> 32:58.750
Ended up with
a damage award
of 500 grand?

32:58.850 --> 33:00.250
Yeah.

33:00.250 --> 33:03.050
Turns out only half
of that ended up
in his account.

33:03.050 --> 33:04.750
What about the
other $250,000?

33:04.850 --> 33:08.550
Look whose account
it went into.

33:15.450 --> 33:16.850
I let him sue me.

33:16.950 --> 33:19.350
They cut him a check,
no questions asked.

33:20.450 --> 33:21.050
So you were
following him

33:21.150 --> 33:22.750
to get pictures
of Steve running.

33:22.850 --> 33:24.550
For my countersuit.

33:24.650 --> 33:26.250
we were splitting
everything 50-50.

33:26.350 --> 33:27.650
We were partners.

33:27.750 --> 33:28.950
I'm sure Cody Lane

33:29.050 --> 33:31.150
was also your partner,
wasn't he?

33:31.250 --> 33:32.450
Who?

33:32.450 --> 33:34.150
Cody Lane. He's our
latest victim.

33:34.250 --> 33:35.750
You paid the
tow truck driver

33:35.850 --> 33:37.450
to push him off so
you could collect
money on him.

33:37.550 --> 33:39.350
No, I've never heard of him.

33:41.050 --> 33:42.650
I swear.

33:51.950 --> 33:55.650
Hey. So the tiger guy
in here won't budge
on Cody Lane.

33:55.750 --> 33:59.050
It's because he doesn't have
anything to do with Cody Lane.

33:59.050 --> 34:00.150
So we're at
a dead end.

34:00.250 --> 34:01.350
Not at all.

34:01.450 --> 34:03.350
Forensic accounting
continued their research

34:03.450 --> 34:07.150
and found out that there was
a pretty hefty life insurance
policy on Cody-- two mil.

34:07.650 --> 34:08.850
Really?
Mm-hmm.

34:09.250 --> 34:10.449
So who's the beneficiary?

34:10.449 --> 34:12.750
You're never going
to guess.

34:14.350 --> 34:15.750
This is a misunderstanding.

34:15.850 --> 34:18.050
We take out insurance
on all of our models.

34:18.150 --> 34:19.350
Of course we do.

34:19.350 --> 34:21.250
It's how we protect
our investment.

34:21.250 --> 34:22.550
Your investment?

34:22.650 --> 34:24.050
Our boys come to us
with nothing,

34:24.150 --> 34:26.550
so we buy them clothes
and we pay for their pictures,

34:26.650 --> 34:27.650
gym memberships.

34:27.650 --> 34:29.449
ABBY:
Veneers, liposuction.

34:29.550 --> 34:30.850
You have to understand

34:30.850 --> 34:32.350
that models are flakes.

34:32.449 --> 34:35.050
They run off, they get fat,
they get hooked on drugs.

34:35.150 --> 34:36.350
And they end up dead.

34:41.250 --> 34:42.050
Think what you want.

34:42.150 --> 34:43.550
I have a business to run.

34:43.650 --> 34:45.449
So do I.

34:48.550 --> 34:51.050
Hey, Calleigh, I found something
kind of interesting

34:51.050 --> 34:52.050
in our agents' past.

34:52.150 --> 34:53.550
Talk to me.

34:53.650 --> 34:55.949
Kyle Jordan, male model,
client of Abby and Janet's

34:56.050 --> 34:58.250
and he died from
a heart attack
in the sauna.

34:58.350 --> 34:59.650
<i>He wore
a nitroglycerine patch t</i>

34:59.750 --> 35:01.750
<i>to treat
a congenital heart problem.</i>

35:01.850 --> 35:03.950
<i>So the heat from the sauna
increased his blood flow</i>

35:04.050 --> 35:05.550
<i>and his dosage absorption.</i>

35:05.650 --> 35:08.150
<i>Slipped into a coma
and then he eventually died.</i>

35:08.250 --> 35:11.650
See, I think that this is when
the girls got their first taste

35:11.650 --> 35:12.950
of insurance money.

35:12.950 --> 35:14.950
* *

35:21.050 --> 35:23.450
It's a classic inciting
incident,

35:23.450 --> 35:26.050
and at some point they went
from these accidents

35:26.050 --> 35:27.350
to actual murder.

35:27.450 --> 35:28.050
You know what?

35:28.050 --> 35:30.250
I think that Janet
may have gotten a payout before then.

35:31.250 --> 35:33.550
JanetSterling's marriage
certificate, May '99.

35:33.550 --> 35:35.550
The brunette,
she's married?

35:35.650 --> 35:39.650
Jake Bolton,
newlywed at 47, dead at 48.

35:39.750 --> 35:41.450
He fell 11 stories.

35:41.550 --> 35:43.750
(man screaming)

35:43.850 --> 35:45.750
Oh, now that sounds familiar.

35:47.250 --> 35:48.850
It was our first anniversary.

35:49.750 --> 35:52.150
He had a little too much
to drink and he fell.

35:52.250 --> 35:54.150
You stood to gain from his death

35:54.250 --> 35:56.350
which makes you
the prime suspect.

35:56.450 --> 35:59.850
(man screaming)

36:01.150 --> 36:03.150
I can't help that I got
the insurance.

36:03.150 --> 36:05.150
How fortunate for you.

36:05.950 --> 36:07.750
Kyle Jordan died
on you guys.

36:07.950 --> 36:10.350
Must have been the easiest money
you ever made.

36:10.450 --> 36:11.850
His death was an accident.

36:11.950 --> 36:14.050
That's true, it was.

36:14.150 --> 36:16.450
But that's when Janet
took the lead

36:16.550 --> 36:19.250
and hired the
tow truck driver
to kill Cody Lane.

36:19.350 --> 36:21.050
She didn't pay for any murder.

36:21.150 --> 36:22.850
Someone is setting her up.

36:22.950 --> 36:26.050
I don't know Janet
would show you the
same kind of loyalty.

36:26.150 --> 36:28.250
It's called a
"Key Man" policy.

36:28.350 --> 36:30.750
It's life insurance
for business partners.

36:30.850 --> 36:32.650
What does it have
to do with me?

36:32.650 --> 36:34.250
You're the insured.

36:38.250 --> 36:39.750
Death benefits of $6 million.

36:39.750 --> 36:42.050
Do you want to guess who took
the policy out on you?

36:55.650 --> 36:56.550
Help me.

36:56.650 --> 36:58.650
If you help us.

37:00.950 --> 37:02.350
(sighs)

37:02.450 --> 37:03.950
I can't.

37:33.650 --> 37:34.850
Thanks for coming, Nick.

37:36.550 --> 37:38.650
This is new,
you inviting me.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.450
Yeah, is this how
it's going to be?

37:40.550 --> 37:41.650
Am I going to
have to leave

37:41.750 --> 37:42.950
every crime scene
that you work?

37:43.050 --> 37:44.150
That's the law.

37:45.650 --> 37:48.050
You know I'll lose my job.

37:51.250 --> 37:53.850
I would consider rescinding.

37:53.950 --> 37:54.950
If...?

37:54.950 --> 37:58.150
If we put
the past behind us

37:58.250 --> 38:00.750
and you start treating me
like a human being.

38:00.850 --> 38:04.350
You be civil to me
at crime scenes.

38:06.650 --> 38:08.650
Alright, deal.

38:14.350 --> 38:16.550
I have to get back to work.

38:18.750 --> 38:20.250
I look forward to working
with you, Nat.

38:20.350 --> 38:21.550
Mm.

38:48.350 --> 38:50.050
Hey.
Hey.

38:50.150 --> 38:51.850
Are you sure you want
to do this?

38:51.950 --> 38:52.950
No.

38:53.250 --> 38:55.450
But I got to pay the rent.

38:55.550 --> 38:56.950
(phone rings)

38:59.150 --> 39:01.050
I got a text message
from Homicide.

39:03.050 --> 39:04.550
Look at the address.

39:05.250 --> 39:07.050
J.A. Models.

39:21.350 --> 39:24.350
Cop out front is
thinking suicide.

39:24.450 --> 39:26.250
Man.

39:31.050 --> 39:33.350
(indistinct radio transmission)

39:44.450 --> 39:45.650
Check out this picture.

39:51.950 --> 39:53.350
Looks like it was moved.

39:59.450 --> 40:00.250
Bullet hole.

40:01.050 --> 40:03.750
Well, Janet's not going
to test fire

40:03.750 --> 40:06.650
and then move a picture
to cover a hole.

40:06.650 --> 40:08.650
That's not how
suicides are done.

40:08.950 --> 40:11.050
It's time to find Abby.

40:15.550 --> 40:17.350
Lip gloss down, Miss Biggs.

40:21.450 --> 40:23.450
I didn't shoot Janet.

40:24.550 --> 40:25.850
She was my friend.

40:25.850 --> 40:27.650
My business partner.

40:34.450 --> 40:35.950
You washed your hands,
didn't you?

40:35.950 --> 40:37.550
Change your clothes, too?

40:37.850 --> 40:39.150
I always do.

40:39.150 --> 40:40.750
I get bored of the same outfit.

40:40.750 --> 40:41.750
(coughs)

40:41.750 --> 40:42.750
It's no big deal.

40:43.250 --> 40:44.250
Doesn't mean anything.

40:44.250 --> 40:45.850
It means you're covering up
the crime.

40:46.950 --> 40:48.150
You're a smart girl.

40:56.150 --> 40:57.450
(coughing)

41:02.050 --> 41:03.350
DELKO:
Not that smart.

41:03.350 --> 41:05.050
You forgot to take off
your bracelet.

41:05.050 --> 41:07.250
You fired that gun, didn't you?

41:20.650 --> 41:22.750
(coughs)

41:23.950 --> 41:25.150
She attacked me.

41:25.150 --> 41:26.650
I was protecting myself.

41:26.650 --> 41:27.850
It was her or me!

41:27.850 --> 41:29.450
I can't... (gasping)

41:30.950 --> 41:32.550
I can't breathe!

41:32.550 --> 41:36.550
(coughing and wheezing)

41:37.050 --> 41:38.050
DELKO:
She's not faking it
She's not faking it.

41:38.050 --> 41:39.150
We need a medic
in here.

41:43.650 --> 41:44.550
DELKO:
She's dying!

41:46.250 --> 41:47.150
Eric, don't!

41:47.150 --> 41:48.250
It's cyanide!

41:49.950 --> 41:51.250
DELKO:
No antidote.

41:53.450 --> 41:54.550
It was her!

41:56.650 --> 41:57.950
I love that color.

41:59.250 --> 42:00.250
Good...

42:03.450 --> 42:04.850
..because I got
one for you.

42:05.350 --> 42:06.350
Thanks.

42:13.750 --> 42:15.350
(siren approaching)

42:29.350 --> 42:31.650

42:56.650 --> 42:58.750
