WEBVTT

00:02.930 --> 00:04.329
I never stopped loving you.

00:07.040 --> 00:09.759
Aria, they're gonna market
the hell out of this book.

00:09.770 --> 00:12.500
- It's gonna be huge.
- Oh, my God, we did it.

00:13.310 --> 00:15.505
I lied to you earlier, Aria.
I did see Ali.

00:15.510 --> 00:17.330
And I'm pretty sure she
confessed to killing Charlotte.

00:17.350 --> 00:18.772
We don't have time
to debate this.

00:18.780 --> 00:21.146
Right now, Alison is safely
locked up at Welby

00:21.150 --> 00:23.948
and Hanna is life
/5 on the llhe.

00:23.950 --> 00:27.386
(Elliott)
I ’m gonna make sure
you live a long life

00:27.390 --> 00:28.709
rotting away in here.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.608
I know you killed Charlotte.

00:30.630 --> 00:33.019
Stop! Please, you have
to help me, please.

00:43.140 --> 00:44.835
Are you sure about this?

00:44.840 --> 00:46.637
Yes, I'm sure.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.505
If someone tried to hurt you,
the police—-

00:48.510 --> 00:51.149
I have to talk to my friends
before I do anything.

00:51.150 --> 00:52.208
I understand.

00:55.150 --> 00:57.880
You're a friend
of my niece, of Alison.

00:59.560 --> 01:01.516
I never said anything
about Alison.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.159
I can tell by the way
that you're looking at me.

01:04.160 --> 01:06.685
You knew my sister Jessica,
Alison's mother

01:06.700 --> 01:08.827
so you must be a friend
of Alison's.

01:08.830 --> 01:10.092
Ali never mentioned anything

01:10.100 --> 01:12.591
about her mother
havrng a srster.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.898
Let alone a twin sister.??

01:14.900 --> 01:18.438
- What's your name?
- Hanna.

01:18.440 --> 01:21.102
Families are very complicated
things, Hanna.

01:21.110 --> 01:23.237
Yeah, I've noticed.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.343
Many families have secrets.

01:25.350 --> 01:28.012
Most families, really.

01:28.020 --> 01:31.342
And sometimes, those secrets
are actual people.

01:33.190 --> 01:35.852
Imagine that.

01:35.860 --> 01:38.124
And that's who you are?

01:38.130 --> 01:39.586
One of those secret people?

01:41.230 --> 01:42.857
Not anymore.

01:47.070 --> 01:49.459
Got a secret
can you keep It?

01:49.470 --> 01:52.234
Swear this one you'll save

01:52.240 --> 01:57.234
Better lock it in your pocket
taking this one to the grave

01:57.250 --> 02:02.119
If I show you then I know
you won't tell what I said

02:02.120 --> 02:07.240
'Cause two can keep a secret
if one of them is dead

02:09.430 --> 02:10.488
(Ezra)
'Here, Hanna.‘

02:15.460 --> 02:17.599
Hanna, are you sure you don't
want to go to the doctor?

02:17.600 --> 02:19.921
- I'm sure.
- Hanna, I think you should.

02:19.940 --> 02:22.431
The doctors _
are gonna ask questions.

02:22.440 --> 02:25.159
And then, I'll have to lie.
No doctors, no questions.

02:26.440 --> 02:29.932
Hanna, I'm sorry,
but you have to tell us

02:29.950 --> 02:32.601
about Mary Drake
picking you up.

02:32.620 --> 02:34.042
Is she real?

02:34.050 --> 02:36.974
I mean, is she really
who she says she is?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.446
We think so.

02:38.450 --> 02:40.645
(Spencer)
'Yeah, she was a patient
at Radley.‘

02:40.660 --> 02:43.049
- We found her file.
- What?

02:43.060 --> 02:46.154
She's Alison's aunt,
Charlotte's biological mother.

02:46.160 --> 02:48.094
The DiLaurentis family
adopted Charlotte.

02:50.330 --> 02:52.867
So it's her.

02:52.870 --> 02:56.294
Mary Drake, she's been
after us all along.

02:56.310 --> 02:58.164
Someone killed her daughter

02:58.170 --> 03:01.571
and then she shows up
to get even.

03:01.580 --> 03:02.877
Yeah, we're pretty sure
she didn't show up

03:02.880 --> 03:04.677
just to get into
the resort business.

03:04.680 --> 03:07.308
She must have been chasing me
when I got out.

03:07.320 --> 03:09.015
But why wouldn't
she just run me over

03:09.020 --> 03:10.647
instead of bringing me here?

03:10.650 --> 03:13.585
Because we gave her
exactly what she wanted.

03:16.160 --> 03:18.253
Charlotte's killer?

03:18.260 --> 03:20.649
We're convinced it's Alison.

03:20.660 --> 03:21.991
We found evidence.

03:22.000 --> 03:24.252
[sighs]

03:24.270 --> 03:27.569
Spencer, can I have something
stronger than coffee in here?

03:27.570 --> 03:28.798
Yeah.

03:38.180 --> 03:39.602
This belongs to you.

03:47.860 --> 03:48.918
Thanks.

03:48.920 --> 03:50.387
[knock on door]

03:50.390 --> 03:51.721
Oh, that's Mona.

03:51.730 --> 03:53.425
Well, be careful
in case it isn't.

03:53.430 --> 03:55.250
[cell phone vibrates]

03:59.870 --> 04:02.839
Well, there was nobody there,
just this.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.203
"Couldn't have done it
wrthout you.

04:10.210 --> 04:12.508
Glad we're on the same team.
A.D."

04:20.890 --> 04:22.517
[door creaking]

04:24.560 --> 04:25.788
It's from Lucas.

04:31.930 --> 04:33.898
Sit down. I can do that.

04:33.900 --> 04:35.993
I can boil my own water.
Thanks.

04:38.240 --> 04:39.400
[Emily clears throat]

04:41.240 --> 04:43.128
Can I, uh, borrow you
for a minute?

04:53.760 --> 04:56.183
So are you gonna take
Lucas up on his offer?

04:56.190 --> 04:57.987
[sighs]
He's crazy.

04:57.990 --> 04:59.582
He sees your potential.

04:59.600 --> 05:01.022
Potential for what?

05:01.030 --> 05:02.827
For what you could do
if you were in charge.

05:02.830 --> 05:04.457
Caleb, haven't you noticed?

05:04.470 --> 05:08.839
None of us are in charge
of anything around here.

05:08.840 --> 05:10.364
Well, we can fix that.

05:10.370 --> 05:12.429
No one's giving up on anybody.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.759
Then what?

05:13.780 --> 05:16.101
Suppose we get through that..

05:16.110 --> 05:17.998
...where does that leave us?

05:18.010 --> 05:20.069
Back to where we started?

05:20.080 --> 05:22.139
Well, I guess it depends
on how far back we wanna go.

05:25.820 --> 05:28.550
[sighs]
Look, in that room
at the resort

05:28.560 --> 05:30.152
before all the lights went off

05:30.160 --> 05:33.880
and someone pushed me down
a hole, I was scared.

05:35.030 --> 05:36.850
Me too.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.668
But you were there.

05:39.670 --> 05:44.266
I always felt safe around you.

05:44.270 --> 05:46.409
Even when we weren't getting
along, you made me feel safe.

05:50.380 --> 05:53.577
Maybe that's why
what happened happened..

05:53.580 --> 05:55.946
...with us.

05:55.950 --> 05:57.770
So you think we just went back

05:57.790 --> 06:00.008
to what we _used to be
for a minute?

06:00.020 --> 06:01.089
Yeah.

06:03.060 --> 06:04.482
Only for a minute.

06:08.200 --> 06:09.656
Where is Spencer?

06:16.870 --> 06:19.703
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

06:19.710 --> 06:22.634
Uh, I just wanted to be
by myself for a minute.

06:25.380 --> 06:27.245
I think we're all feeling
a little lost right now.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.672
I'm fine.

06:31.650 --> 06:33.811
Do you think Ali's safe?

06:33.820 --> 06:35.412
At Welby?

06:35.420 --> 06:37.615
I mean, places like that
are designed to keep people

06:37.630 --> 06:40.224
from getting out,
not from getting in.

06:40.230 --> 06:42.152
Maybe we need to warn Elliott.

06:42.160 --> 06:43.650
Well, what do you
wanna tell him?

06:43.670 --> 06:45.558
'That we told someone his wife'

06:45.570 --> 06:48.266
killed her own sister_
who's actually her cousm?

06:48.270 --> 06:50.067
I mean, he'd lock us up.

06:50.070 --> 06:51.628
Spencer.

06:51.640 --> 06:54.302
Hey, how about I take you home?

06:54.310 --> 06:56.574
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:00.350 --> 07:03.069
Em, keep an eye on Hanna.

07:05.350 --> 07:08.683
- You feel it too?
- Yeah, she's got that look.

07:08.690 --> 07:10.157
The dollhouse look.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.153
Bye.

07:18.930 --> 07:20.067
Do you wanna give Jordan a call?

07:23.470 --> 07:25.267
And tell him what?

07:25.270 --> 07:27.864
That I got myself
a little kidnapped for a while?

07:27.880 --> 07:29.438
Maybe you just wanna hear
his voice.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.544
It's too late to call him now.
I'll do it later.

07:36.120 --> 07:37.109
[sighs]

07:44.160 --> 07:46.025
Hey, aren't you tired?

07:47.630 --> 07:52.226
Um, no, I shot past tired
a long time ago.

07:52.230 --> 07:54.494
Well, we should probably
get some sleep while we can.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.639
Yeah, I just have to finish
this up for my mom.

07:58.140 --> 07:59.801
Turns out
there's way more paperwork

07:59.810 --> 08:01.539
when you win instead of lose.

08:03.710 --> 08:07.874
Our love is six feet under

08:07.880 --> 08:12.385
I can't help
but wonder if our..

08:12.390 --> 08:14.415
I'm really glad
that Hanna's safe.

08:16.020 --> 08:17.351
We all are.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.885
That was so dangerous.
I should've stopped her.

08:21.230 --> 08:25.166
You know, Hanna's like
an aircraft carrier.

08:25.170 --> 08:27.821
Lot of firepower, but
pretty difficult to maneuver.

08:31.410 --> 08:34.664
Yeah, well, I guess they call
ships "she" for a reason, huh?

08:36.680 --> 08:40.172
You trace my lips

08:40.180 --> 08:42.569
Erase your touch..

08:42.580 --> 08:45.686
- Come to bed.
- I will soon.

08:45.690 --> 08:48.955
Too much for me

08:52.060 --> 08:56.326
Ooh

08:58.930 --> 09:03.958
Ooh

09:05.840 --> 09:08.229
Again

[cell phone ringing]

09:22.820 --> 09:23.855
Hello.

09:23.860 --> 09:26.078
[woman gasping over phone]

09:26.090 --> 09:28.320
Hello?

09:28.330 --> 09:31.197
(Alison)
'Help me.‘

09:31.200 --> 09:33.498
Who is this?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.832
(Alison)
'Help me, Emily.'

09:35.840 --> 09:37.694
Ali?

09:37.710 --> 09:39.200
'Em, I need you.‘

09:40.440 --> 09:41.429
[Alison sobs]

09:41.440 --> 09:43.829
Ali, are you alright?

09:45.010 --> 09:46.671
- 'Let go.‘
- Hello.

09:46.680 --> 09:49.114
- 'Give me the phone.‘
- 'No. No.‘

09:52.820 --> 09:54.515
Ali?

09:54.520 --> 09:56.556
[phone disconnects]

10:01.700 --> 10:03.827
No, you made a mistake.
I visited her the other day.

10:03.830 --> 10:05.491
I'm the one
that brought her here.

10:05.500 --> 10:08.537
Mrs. Rollins' visiting
instructions have been changed.

10:08.540 --> 10:11.293
- Family only.
- W-why did they change?

10:11.310 --> 10:12.538
Did something happen?

10:12.540 --> 10:14.861
All I can tell you
is the only visitors

10:14.880 --> 10:17.508
she'_s allowed
are family members.

10:17.510 --> 10:20.479
Is Dr. Rollins here?
Can you page him, please?

10:20.480 --> 10:21.913
Dr. Rollins
is right over there.

10:26.190 --> 10:28.886
- Elliott.
- Emily.

10:28.890 --> 10:30.585
Thank you.

10:30.590 --> 10:32.820
They won't let me in
to see Ali.

10:32.830 --> 10:34.889
Those are my instructions.

10:34.900 --> 10:37.050
Is she alright?
Has something happened?

10:40.870 --> 10:42.997
I've decided
Alison will be better off

10:43.010 --> 10:44.830
in isolation right now.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.705
Okay, can I just
see her for a minute?

10:46.710 --> 10:49.679
It's not in Ali's
best interests

10:49.680 --> 10:51.432
or yours.

10:51.450 --> 10:54.669
So, when can she have visitors?

10:54.680 --> 10:56.910
As soon as I think she can,
I'll call you.

10:56.920 --> 10:58.842
[cell phone rings]

10:58.850 --> 11:00.989
I have to go. I'm sorry.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.319
Thanks.

11:05.860 --> 11:08.852
[dramatic music]

11:17.110 --> 11:20.864
(Lucas)
So how is Alison doing?

11:20.880 --> 11:22.939
I heard she was
in the hospital.

11:22.940 --> 11:24.737
I wish people would
just leave her alone.

11:24.750 --> 11:27.207
I was just asking
how she's doing.

11:27.220 --> 11:30.075
Sorry.

11:30.090 --> 11:34.413
- So how are you?
- I'm kinda tired.

11:34.420 --> 11:36.149
Did you get the package
that I sent over?

11:38.590 --> 11:41.286
Lucas, why are you
doing this for me?

11:41.300 --> 11:42.927
I mean, you could be out

11:42.930 --> 11:45.069
building some
private spaceship or something.

11:45.070 --> 11:46.321
The private spaceship market

11:46.330 --> 11:48.798
is a little overcrowded
at the moment.

11:48.800 --> 11:51.598
- Did you look at the papers?
- There were a lot of them.

11:51.610 --> 11:54.602
Lot of those little
"Sign here" stickers.

11:54.610 --> 11:56.237
Why do you make it
so hard for somebody

11:56.240 --> 11:58.401
to do something nice for you?

11:58.410 --> 12:00.298
Why do you resist it so much?

12:00.320 --> 12:04.609
Look, Lucas, I think you think
I'm somebody I'm not.

12:04.620 --> 12:06.508
Everyone thinks
I'm somebody I'm not.

12:06.520 --> 12:08.909
Somebody smarter..

12:08.920 --> 12:10.319
...braver, sharper.

12:12.860 --> 12:14.282
But I'm not.

12:14.300 --> 12:17.849
Yes, you are.
That's the point.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.792
Hanna, I think you want this.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.495
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have offered it.

12:22.670 --> 12:24.638
But I do need an answer.

12:24.640 --> 12:25.959
We need to file a business plan

12:25.970 --> 12:28.473
or we're gonna lose
the tax credit.

12:28.480 --> 12:30.300
Look, I'm just saying,
I'm not the best person

12:30.310 --> 12:32.540
when it comes
to making deCISIons.

12:32.550 --> 12:34.575
Well, Hanna,
not making a decision..

12:35.880 --> 12:37.142
...that's a decision.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.409
If you could've heard her
on the phone.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.684
Maybe she killed Charlotte,
maybe she didn't.

12:43.690 --> 12:45.920
We can't just leave her in there
with no one protecting her.

12:45.930 --> 12:47.989
Okay, well, did you tell
Elliott about the call?

12:48.000 --> 12:50.321
No, I didn't want him to know
who she was calling.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.649
So, where did you leave
things with him?

12:51.670 --> 12:53.092
He said he'll call me
when she Improves.

12:53.100 --> 12:54.419
But I don't think we can wait.

12:54.440 --> 12:57.000
[cell phone rings]

12:58.340 --> 13:01.503
Um, it's my work.
I'll call them back.

13:01.510 --> 13:03.831
- What about Mary Drake?
- What about her?

13:03.850 --> 13:06.671
She's family, she has access,
you know?

13:06.680 --> 13:07.999
Should we try and use her?

13:08.020 --> 13:10.511
Ask Mary to take us
to see Ali?

13:10.520 --> 13:12.545
Em, we think this woman
might be Uber A.

13:12.550 --> 13:14.108
- You wanna ask her to help?
- Okay.

13:14.120 --> 13:15.758
Maybe it's better
that we go in there with her

13:15.760 --> 13:18.183
than let her go in
by herself.

13:18.190 --> 13:20.351
No, we can't take that chance.

13:23.100 --> 13:26.228
I think we both saw this coming.

13:26.230 --> 13:28.369
Apparently, one of us saw it
before the other.

13:28.370 --> 13:29.962
I'm sorry.

13:29.970 --> 13:31.130
[sighs]

13:31.140 --> 13:32.767
Yeah, so am I.

13:32.770 --> 13:34.431
It's just coming home

13:34.440 --> 13:36.271
and seeing my friends
and everything

13:36.280 --> 13:38.703
that Ali's going through
I realize I've got a lot

13:38.710 --> 13:40.541
of unresolved things in my life

13:40.550 --> 13:42.313
and it wouldn't be fair to you.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.276
I think you want me
to say "Thank you"

13:44.290 --> 13:46.110
but I'm not going to.

13:46.120 --> 13:47.815
No, I just want you
to understand.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.811
I've gotta work through
these things.

13:49.830 --> 13:53.652
It doesn't have anything to do
with the book or Ezra.

13:53.660 --> 13:55.059
[sighs]
It's all me.

13:55.060 --> 13:57.221
It's just about you and me.

13:57.230 --> 14:01.326
Yeah. I'm sorry--

14:01.340 --> 14:03.228
Aria, I think you don't
have to say that anymore.

14:03.240 --> 14:04.662
(Aria)
'I'm. .'

14:04.670 --> 14:06.103
[sighs]

14:06.110 --> 14:08.135
[sighs]

14:12.750 --> 14:15.913
I got a surprise too.

14:15.920 --> 14:17.478
It's not as big
as yours, but, um..

14:19.520 --> 14:21.078
I'm back on the book.

14:21.090 --> 14:22.352
'That's what I came here
to tell you.‘

14:22.360 --> 14:23.952
- You're back on the book?
- Yeah.

14:23.960 --> 14:25.655
I convinced Jillian
that I'd be able to prep

14:25.660 --> 14:28.652
the manuscript faster than
anyone else, and she agreed.

14:28.660 --> 14:30.150
You're gonna edit the book?

14:30.170 --> 14:33.128
More that I'll be a kind
of creative gatekeeper.

14:33.130 --> 14:34.825
Make sure everything goes well

14:34.840 --> 14:38.162
and everybody stays
reasonably happy.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.938
Do we have a problem?

14:41.940 --> 14:44.329
I-I don't know. Do we?

14:51.050 --> 14:53.518
You worked hard for this.

14:53.520 --> 14:56.182
I'd like to see you get
something you've always wanted.

14:59.060 --> 15:01.028
We're almost there, aren't we?

15:02.900 --> 15:04.299
Yeah, almost.

15:05.670 --> 15:08.366
Then we'll do it.

15:08.370 --> 15:09.962
We'll make it work.

15:09.970 --> 15:11.961
Yeah, at least we can cross
the finish line together.

15:16.540 --> 15:17.609
[Liam sighs]

15:21.650 --> 15:23.049
[sighs]

15:30.760 --> 15:32.648
Not just first class.

15:32.660 --> 15:35.925
First class, front row,
window, the side with the door.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.320
Because she has to be
the last one on the plane

15:40.340 --> 15:41.762
and the ﬁrst one off.

15:43.840 --> 15:45.865
No, don't say you'll try,
just do it.

15:45.870 --> 15:49.237
Girls and boys they enjoy

15:49.240 --> 15:53.279
In a love that destroys

15:53.280 --> 15:56.647
Stack them in let them win..

15:58.390 --> 16:00.119
I need my napkin.

16:00.120 --> 16:01.883
Huh?

16:01.890 --> 16:04.256
Under your drink,
that's my napkin.

16:04.260 --> 16:06.558
Oh, yeah, sure.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.448
God, don't tear it.

16:08.460 --> 16:10.496
Sorry.

16:10.500 --> 16:11.967
[sighs]

16:13.900 --> 16:15.299
What's wrong?

16:15.300 --> 16:17.131
You just melted a really
important phone number.

16:17.140 --> 16:18.767
That's what's wrong.

16:18.770 --> 16:20.306
You and your sweaty glass.

16:22.010 --> 16:24.979
Yeah. It's okay.

16:24.980 --> 16:26.607
See, the ink ran,
but you can see

16:26.610 --> 16:28.339
where the pen pressed
into the napkin.

16:28.350 --> 16:30.238
See? There.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.442
- Thank you.
- Mm.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.758
Sorry about my sweaty glass.

16:35.760 --> 16:37.853
It's okay.

16:37.860 --> 16:40.078
So what do they charge you
for office space around here?

16:40.100 --> 16:42.352
I'm a really good tipper.

16:42.360 --> 16:45.056
Long day at the office?
Can I get you something to eat?

16:46.770 --> 16:48.590
Suppose I'm meeting someone?

16:48.600 --> 16:50.158
You're not.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.592
How do you know that?

16:51.610 --> 16:53.464
Well, you ordered
a second drink.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.708
If you were meeting someone

16:54.710 --> 16:55.870
you would've nursed
your first drink.

16:57.510 --> 17:00.001
Have you been
counting my drinks?

17:00.020 --> 17:01.578
I notice details.

17:03.120 --> 17:05.384
Interesting how
your sweaty glass

17:05.390 --> 17:08.951
just happened to land
on my phone number, isn't it?

17:08.960 --> 17:10.279
Well, that is the most
interesting thing

17:10.290 --> 17:12.850
that's happened to me all night.

17:12.860 --> 17:14.555
All through the night

17:14.560 --> 17:16.653
Don't need sleep to dream

17:16.660 --> 17:18.719
All through the night

17:18.730 --> 17:20.698
All through the night

17:20.700 --> 17:22.668
All through the night

17:22.670 --> 17:24.558
Don't need sleep to dream

17:26.670 --> 17:30.470
Don't need sleep to dream

17:30.480 --> 17:33.040
Don't need sleep to dream

17:34.480 --> 17:37.711
Don't need sleep to dream

17:40.320 --> 17:43.551
- We just wanna see her.
- All we need is five minutes.

17:43.560 --> 17:45.858
If you really wanna help

17:45.860 --> 17:48.351
you'll give Alison time
and space to heal.

17:48.360 --> 17:50.055
That's what she needs
and that's what

17:50.070 --> 17:51.753
I'm going to make sure she gets.

17:51.770 --> 17:53.658
'I'm sorry if you can't
understand that.‘

17:53.670 --> 17:55.490
I know you're her friends

17:55.500 --> 17:57.593
but I am her husband
and her doctor.

17:57.610 --> 18:01.569
Maybe that's not
the best combination.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.774
Meaning what?

18:02.780 --> 18:04.270
Meaning maybe we're not
the only ones

18:04.280 --> 18:06.498
who need a little objectivity.

18:06.510 --> 18:09.047
Well, maybe I'm not
the most objective person.

18:09.050 --> 18:10.870
Perhaps that's because
I've spent the best part

18:10.890 --> 18:14.246
of five years taking care
of Ali and Charlotte.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.512
I lack the clarity you have,
being gone so long.

18:16.520 --> 18:18.954
Alright, this isn't about
who cares about Alison the most.

18:18.960 --> 18:20.257
We all wanna see her get better.

18:20.260 --> 18:22.353
That's what I'm trying to do.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.453
And, yes, I have consulted
other doctors

18:24.470 --> 18:26.062
and I've spoken to Jason.

18:26.070 --> 18:28.197
- You have?
- Yes.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.736
He approves of her treatment.

18:29.740 --> 18:32.766
- What about Mary Drake?
- I won't let Mary Drake visit.

18:32.770 --> 18:34.203
I'm concerned
about AlI's reaction

18:34.210 --> 18:36.098
to someone who looks
so much like her mother.

18:36.110 --> 18:39.375
- But that's Ali's aunt--
- I'm going to do what's best.

18:39.380 --> 18:41.371
[cell phone ringing]

18:44.720 --> 18:46.312
Excuse me.

18:48.720 --> 18:49.982
'Yeah.‘

18:53.930 --> 18:56.592
Is that the kind of diplomacy
you learned in Washington?

18:56.600 --> 18:59.660
I'm sorry, Aria, I have a very
low tolerance for condescension.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.561
Yeah, and I don't think
we're going to get it.

19:03.570 --> 19:05.390
Which means that Alison stays
on one side of the wall

19:05.410 --> 19:06.809
and we're on the other side.

19:06.810 --> 19:09.677
[cell phones chime]

19:09.680 --> 19:13.047
"She's mine now. No take backs.
No do-overs. A.D."

19:14.580 --> 19:17.140
She's mine now?

19:17.150 --> 19:19.038
Does that mean that
AD. is already in Welby?

19:29.960 --> 19:32.622
I met someone

19:32.630 --> 19:34.393
I'll call him the breeze

19:35.470 --> 19:40.134
He sent me flying

19:40.140 --> 19:44.372
I met someone
who terrlfles me..

19:44.380 --> 19:46.245
What's the meaning of this?

19:46.250 --> 19:48.070
It's a hostile takeover.

19:48.080 --> 19:50.548
- Of what?
- Of you.

19:50.550 --> 19:52.040
What makes you think
it has to be hostile?

19:53.820 --> 19:58.587
Well, I haven't exactly
been the model
ﬁancee
lately

19:58.590 --> 20:01.320
so I thought I'll put
a little more effort into it.

20:01.330 --> 20:03.389
You know, that's not supposed
to be a job.

20:03.400 --> 20:05.254
I think the idea is
you're supposed to have fun.

20:08.100 --> 20:10.830
I remember fun.

20:10.840 --> 20:12.330
Do you?

20:12.340 --> 20:14.035
Faintly.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.439
You know, sometimes
you turn into

20:15.440 --> 20:17.601
the most serious person
I've ever known.

20:17.610 --> 20:19.202
Okay, I didn't come here
to be insulted.

20:19.210 --> 20:21.701
Not all the time.
Just lately.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.347
Since you've been
spending time in Rosewood.

20:23.350 --> 20:26.012
Yeah, well, it can have
that effect on you.

20:26.020 --> 20:27.681
Then why do you keep
going back there?

20:30.790 --> 20:34.920
- Do you know what I wanna do?
- What do you wanna do?

20:34.930 --> 20:38.422
Do you remember that bar
off Columbus where we first met?

20:38.430 --> 20:41.092
Yes, I do.

20:41.100 --> 20:44.297
Well, I wanna go back there

20:44.310 --> 20:47.199
and buy you a drink.

20:47.210 --> 20:49.201
And I wanna go back there
and flirt with you

20:49.210 --> 20:52.441
and start all over again.

20:52.450 --> 20:54.941
Is that something
that might interest you?

20:54.950 --> 20:58.477
I'm waving wi-uh-uh-uh-wild

21:01.820 --> 21:04.709
Elliott's not gonna help us.
We have to do something.

21:04.730 --> 21:07.619
Okay, something does not include
making a deal with the devil.

21:07.630 --> 21:09.791
Besides, you heard him,
Mary cannot get in there

21:09.800 --> 21:11.222
anymore than we can.

21:11.230 --> 21:12.561
Okay, but what if
we did it together?

21:12.570 --> 21:14.219
If we used Mary Drake
to get us in.

21:14.240 --> 21:16.094
No, Emily, it's not happening.

21:16.100 --> 21:18.591
Hey, look, I'm not saying
that we let her in the club.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.737
I'm not even saying
that we should trust her.

21:20.740 --> 21:22.731
But we need a way to Ali
and right now

21:22.740 --> 21:25.607
Mary Drake is the closest thing
to a key that we've got.

21:25.610 --> 21:27.168
We don't know anything
about her.

21:27.180 --> 21:29.978
You know more about her
than anybody else.

21:29.980 --> 21:32.119
You were in there, Spencer.

21:32.120 --> 21:35.487
In Radley, before the designer
cocktails and the valet parking.

21:35.490 --> 21:37.981
You were locked in there.

21:37.990 --> 21:39.321
You know how that feels.

21:39.330 --> 21:41.059
And you know what
that can do to a person.

21:45.530 --> 21:47.589
Rollins talked to Jason?

21:47.600 --> 21:48.919
That's what he said.

21:48.940 --> 21:50.191
According to Toby,
that's something

21:50.200 --> 21:51.997
that nobody else
has managed to do.

21:52.010 --> 21:53.762
Are the police looking
for Jason?

21:53.780 --> 21:56.499
Toby is. He needs someone
to confirm Mary Drake's story.

21:57.610 --> 21:59.771
Confirmation
other than her face?

21:59.780 --> 22:02.248
People don't seem to remember
Ali's mother having a sister.

22:04.220 --> 22:05.812
When do you meet with Liam?

22:05.820 --> 22:07.617
Uh, 4 o'clock.

22:08.690 --> 22:10.885
Can we make this work with him?

22:10.890 --> 22:13.358
Of course, we can
make it work. I think.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.954
At least long enough
to finish the book.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.791
I was in_ such a rush
to get It over with

22:17.800 --> 22:19.324
that I broke up with him
before he told me

22:19.330 --> 22:20.820
that he was back on the book.

22:20.840 --> 22:23.035
I really complicated
the situation.

22:25.370 --> 22:28.009
All due respect,
things have been complicated

22:28.010 --> 22:29.637
for quite some time.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.347
This book means as much
to Liam as it does to us

22:32.350 --> 22:33.647
and that's why
he wants to work on it.

22:33.650 --> 22:35.140
Yeah, it might mean
as much to him

22:35.150 --> 22:37.710
but it does not mean
the same things.

22:40.820 --> 22:43.709
I promise I will make this work.

22:49.600 --> 22:52.626
[instrumental music]

23:08.420 --> 23:10.570
And there's a problem
with his backstory.

23:10.590 --> 23:12.888
I just noticed it
this last time through.

23:12.890 --> 23:14.881
Uh, what-what sort of problem?

23:16.920 --> 23:19.127
The predatory nature
of his actions.

23:21.060 --> 23:23.620
You think he comes across
as predatory?

23:25.630 --> 23:28.895
I understand the impulse,
the Lolita myth.

23:28.900 --> 23:32.563
Not the Nabokov original
but the whole older man

23:32.570 --> 23:34.333
'inappropriately
young girl idea'

23:34.340 --> 23:37.070
that's been trashed
by lesser writers.

23:39.180 --> 23:42.069
Well, uh,
we can't all be Nabokov.

23:42.080 --> 23:44.947
Some of us can't even manage
Nicholas Sparks.

23:44.950 --> 23:46.611
Well, at least Sparks
understands what a reader

23:46.620 --> 23:49.680
can tolerate and what makes
their skin crawl.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.258
Are we looking
at the same pages here?

23:53.260 --> 23:56.320
Because they aren't
that far apart in age

23:56.330 --> 24:00.926
so I'm having a little trouble
seeing what you're seeing here.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.965
That's because he's your hero.

24:02.970 --> 24:05.598
_ _ Yo_u'_re invested
In justifying his actions.

24:05.610 --> 24:09.535
'You're too close _
to see him as he really is.'

24:09.540 --> 24:11.030
Listen, I'm just
being frank here.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.075
If-if I can't be frank,
I can't help you.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.781
- We all want the best book.
- Exactly.

24:20.790 --> 24:22.849
'And right now,
there's this friction'

24:22.860 --> 24:24.509
between your chapters
and Aria's.

24:24.530 --> 24:27.727
- Friction?
- Look.

24:27.730 --> 24:30.722
Neither one of us want
Aria to look foolish, right?

24:30.730 --> 24:32.823
Like she let herself
get talked into something

24:32.830 --> 24:34.969
that she didn't want.

24:34.970 --> 24:36.790
You mean Aria's character.

24:38.410 --> 24:40.059
Yeah, her character.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.732
I'm here to protect this book.

24:43.740 --> 24:47.073
And that means protecting
the authors. Both of them.

24:47.080 --> 24:48.809
Protecting from what?

24:48.820 --> 24:51.812
A loss of perspective.
Poor judgment.

24:51.820 --> 24:55.278
- Avoidable bad choices.
- That's a big responsibility.

24:56.660 --> 24:59.458
- And I take it very seriously.
- Yes.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.627
I can see that.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.169
I-I just, I understand
that I have commitments

25:09.170 --> 25:11.536
but I have commitments here too.

25:11.540 --> 25:14.259
'Yes, and you agreed.‘

25:14.280 --> 25:17.534
I will get a hard date
as soon as I can.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.347
Thank you. Bye.

25:19.350 --> 25:21.671
[sighs]

25:21.680 --> 25:24.717
- Hello, Spencer.
- Miss Drake.

25:24.720 --> 25:27.541
I saw you in here, and I thought
I'd ask about your friend.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.915
About Hanna. How is she?

25:29.920 --> 25:32.718
Uh, she's, she's alright.

25:32.730 --> 25:35.358
Has she told you any more
about what happened to her?

25:35.360 --> 25:37.225
No. No, not much.

25:37.230 --> 25:38.595
I have to tell you,
I don't feel

25:38.600 --> 25:40.022
especially good
about the other night.

25:40.030 --> 25:41.361
What about it?

25:41.370 --> 25:43.031
Letting Hanna talk me
into taking her

25:43.040 --> 25:45.861
to your house instead
of the police or the hospital.

25:45.870 --> 25:48.031
- So why did you?
- She insisted.

25:48.040 --> 25:51.635
Yes but you were the one
who was driving the car.

25:51.650 --> 25:52.969
You could have taken her
to the police.

25:52.980 --> 25:54.709
You could have taken her
to the doctor.

25:54.720 --> 25:58.042
You could have taken her
anywhere, but you didn't. Why?

25:58.050 --> 26:00.541
Frankly, Spencer,
my experiences with hospitals

26:00.560 --> 26:03.051
and the police haven't
always been the best.

26:03.060 --> 26:05.585
I'm sorry, what do you mean?

26:05.590 --> 26:09.890
I told you that my sister
and I had issues.

26:09.900 --> 26:12.892
That's true,
but not really honest.

26:12.900 --> 26:14.993
One of the most distressing
things about Alison

26:15.000 --> 26:16.558
being where she is
right now is that

26:16.570 --> 26:19.835
I have had similar experiences.

26:19.840 --> 26:23.401
I spent time,
considerable time

26:23.410 --> 26:25.469
in Radley when it was
a sanitarium.

26:27.180 --> 26:29.000
May I ask you why?

26:30.380 --> 26:33.087
Why you were at Radley?

26:35.860 --> 26:37.111
I'm gonna tell you this

26:37.120 --> 26:38.849
because I want you
to understand

26:38.860 --> 26:41.124
why I'm so worried
about Alison.

26:45.500 --> 26:48.196
We were 14, my sister and I.

26:48.200 --> 26:50.464
Jessica was babysitting.

26:50.470 --> 26:53.303
She called me to complain that
the baby wouldn't stop crying.

26:54.810 --> 26:57.802
It was the Carver baby, Teddy.

26:57.810 --> 27:00.472
He was ten months old,
and he had a cold

27:00.480 --> 27:02.277
and he must have been
miserable.

27:04.690 --> 27:06.487
She begged me
to come and help her.

27:06.490 --> 27:09.550
I didn't want to go,
but I did.

27:11.590 --> 27:14.423
And when I got there, the baby
was upstairs finally asleep.

27:14.430 --> 27:16.022
Jessica said
she had given him a bath

27:16.030 --> 27:17.292
and he had fallen right off.

27:18.830 --> 27:20.491
Then she asked me
to stay with Teddy

27:20.500 --> 27:24.197
so she could meet up
with Matt Brooks.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.007
Jessica left.

27:26.010 --> 27:29.901
And when the Carvers came home,
I told them that

27:29.910 --> 27:32.674
Jessica had called me
because she had a headache.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.272
Mrs. Carver went upstairs.

27:35.850 --> 27:39.411
Mr. Carver was giving me
Jessica's money.

27:41.860 --> 27:43.612
Mrs. Carver started to scream.

27:45.530 --> 27:47.452
_ She screamed
like she was on fire.

27:50.870 --> 27:52.497
Teddy was dead.

27:56.370 --> 27:57.860
When they found Jessica,
she said

27:57.870 --> 27:59.462
well, the baby had been fine
when she left.

28:01.040 --> 28:03.099
- But you told them--
- They believed Jessica.

28:04.480 --> 28:06.175
Everybody always
believed Jessica.

28:07.980 --> 28:09.447
She was the warm one.

28:10.820 --> 28:13.084
And that was why your parents
put you in Radley.

28:13.090 --> 28:14.614
It was that or prison.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.716
They thought I'd be safer.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.125
At least that's what
they told me.

28:27.270 --> 28:29.431
Are you sure?

28:29.440 --> 28:32.068
Liam can be really passionate
about writing.

28:32.070 --> 28:35.460
What I got wasn't criticism.
It was anger.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.436
Anger at what?

28:37.450 --> 28:40.248
At me.

28:40.250 --> 28:42.605
And I promised
to keep my side clean

28:42.620 --> 28:45.748
but if every note session
is gonna be a ten-round bout

28:45.750 --> 28:47.615
I-I don't know what's
gonna be left of this book

28:47.620 --> 28:49.451
or of any of us.

28:49.460 --> 28:52.088
I don't understand.

28:52.090 --> 28:57.050
Aria, what does Liam
really know about you and me?

29:01.870 --> 29:04.088
Well, this is the address.

29:04.110 --> 29:06.670
I'm afraid it's gone.

29:06.670 --> 29:08.467
No, it can't be gone.

29:08.480 --> 29:10.436
Oh, we haven't been here
in a long time.

29:10.440 --> 29:12.203
No, it cannot be gone.

29:12.210 --> 29:14.940
I mean, they-they can't just
take it away like that.

29:14.950 --> 29:16.269
You can't just pull out
a building

29:16.280 --> 29:17.474
like it was a bad tooth
or something.

29:17.490 --> 29:19.048
It's New York City, Hanna.

29:19.050 --> 29:20.449
They tear things down
as quickly as they put them up.

29:20.450 --> 29:22.111
Well, this was important.

29:22.120 --> 29:24.554
Okay, I needed this to be here
right where I left it.

29:24.560 --> 29:26.357
I was counting on it.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.351
I mean, Jordan,
this is where we first met.

29:28.360 --> 29:29.850
And now we don't have
a beginning anymore

29:29.860 --> 29:31.225
because they tore it down.

29:31.230 --> 29:32.788
Who do you people
think you are?

29:32.800 --> 29:35.667
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What's wrong?

29:35.670 --> 29:37.092
Tell me and I'll fix it.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.369
I was gonna make it
perfect this time.

29:41.710 --> 29:44.508
You know, everybody gets
what they want.

29:44.510 --> 29:47.149
God, I had it all figured out
and now it's ruined.

29:47.150 --> 29:49.004
It's gone,
and it'll never work now.

29:49.020 --> 29:50.817
W—we'll just go someplace else.

29:50.820 --> 29:53.482
They'll just tear that down too.
Don't you get it?

29:53.490 --> 29:55.845
I'm a one-woman
demolition derby.

29:55.860 --> 29:57.487
Okay, I can't do this to you.

29:57.490 --> 29:58.889
What do you want?

30:00.390 --> 30:03.257
Hanna, I would move Heaven
and Earth for you?

30:04.600 --> 30:06.363
You know that, don't you?

30:06.370 --> 30:09.362
Yes...I do

30:09.370 --> 30:10.962
and I am so sorry.

30:14.210 --> 30:16.929
Hanna, come on.
This can't be it.

30:17.550 --> 30:20.303
[pop music]

30:32.130 --> 30:35.122
[instrumental music]

30:53.750 --> 30:55.149
(Emily)
'Miss Drake?‘

30:56.080 --> 30:57.911
Emily Fields.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.980
I was at Spencer's
when you dropped off Hanna.

31:00.990 --> 31:03.481
Emily. Yes.

31:03.490 --> 31:04.787
Are you staying here now?

31:04.790 --> 31:06.655
No, I was just..

31:07.800 --> 31:09.279
...thinking about
this place today

31:09.300 --> 31:12.428
and wondering
what it looked like now.

31:12.430 --> 31:14.523
Do you wanna sit down?

31:14.540 --> 31:16.394
Yes, I think I would.

31:25.810 --> 31:28.847
I saw they kept the big gates
out in front.

31:28.850 --> 31:32.172
Yeah, they did.

31:32.190 --> 31:35.887
At night, boys from town used
to rattle sticks on the bars.

31:35.890 --> 31:39.189
Somebody would dare them to go
to the nut house after midnight.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.499
I thought it was pretty
frightening during the day.

31:44.500 --> 31:46.968
It was.

31:46.970 --> 31:48.699
But sometimes
you find tenderness

31:48.700 --> 31:51.965
in the last place you'd expect.

31:51.970 --> 31:54.336
And that's really all
any of us needs to survive

31:54.340 --> 31:56.399
is a little tenderness
at the right moment.

31:59.850 --> 32:01.477
I went to visit Ali
this morning.

32:02.920 --> 32:04.512
How is she?

32:04.520 --> 32:05.976
They wouldn't let me in
to see her.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.412
Who wouldn't let you in?

32:07.420 --> 32:10.981
Elliot or Dr. Rollins.

32:10.990 --> 32:12.582
He doesn't want me
to see her either.

32:14.230 --> 32:16.255
But you-you've been talking
to him about her, right?

32:16.260 --> 32:18.524
Over the phone. Once.

32:18.530 --> 32:21.021
Are you satisfied with how
he's been taking care of her?

32:21.040 --> 32:22.564
Oh, yes.

32:23.200 --> 32:25.065
I suppose.

32:25.070 --> 32:27.607
Overall. I mean,
he's very professional.

32:28.340 --> 32:29.534
Yeah.

32:29.540 --> 32:31.428
But it_ does take some
getting used to him

32:31.450 --> 32:34.749
being her new husband
and her doctor.

32:37.020 --> 32:40.410
I'm the one
that took Ali to Welby

32:40.420 --> 32:43.912
and I can't help but wonder
ifI did the right thing.

32:44.730 --> 32:46.186
You wanted to help.

32:46.190 --> 32:48.454
Yeah, but I don't know ifI did.

32:50.030 --> 32:51.850
You're Ali's aunt.

32:51.870 --> 32:54.919
Maybe if you talk to somebody
at the sanitarium..

32:55.870 --> 32:57.132
I don't know, Emily.

32:57.140 --> 32:59.938
That would be
like challenging Dr. Rollins.

33:01.740 --> 33:04.868
Yeah, I understand.

33:04.880 --> 33:09.101
Perhaps you and I can go
to the sanitarium together.

33:11.290 --> 33:14.646
Look, I feel bad about
how we left things today.

33:14.660 --> 33:18.289
If we don't work on this project
together, it'll be another one.

33:18.290 --> 33:19.609
Can I borrow your pen?

33:19.630 --> 33:21.325
My pen?

33:21.330 --> 33:22.729
To sign these papers, partner.

33:24.300 --> 33:26.256
You're right. I want this.

33:26.270 --> 33:29.068
And right now, I want this
more than anything else.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.941
You said that
we could work together.

33:43.950 --> 33:45.542
That we could all be adults.

33:45.550 --> 33:47.780
- I meant it when I said it.
- Then what happened?

33:47.790 --> 33:49.212
I don't know.

33:49.220 --> 33:51.882
Reading his pages again
and then sitting there

33:51.890 --> 33:53.721
listening to him
while he was talking..

33:55.360 --> 33:57.521
He has a way with words.

33:57.530 --> 33:59.327
- I used to admire that.
- You don't anymore?

33:59.330 --> 34:01.059
No, now I am suspicious.

34:01.070 --> 34:02.321
Of what?

34:02.340 --> 34:05.036
It was a lot
of unconnected things

34:05.040 --> 34:07.634
that I didn't wanna connect
and then they clicked

34:07.640 --> 34:09.460
together on their own.

34:09.480 --> 34:11.471
Your history,
what you've been writing

34:11.480 --> 34:13.038
how you've been writing it.

34:13.050 --> 34:14.972
What changes in a room
when you guys are alone together

34:14.980 --> 34:16.470
and then somebody else walks in?

34:16.480 --> 34:20.541
Okay, and what do
all these connections mean?

34:23.160 --> 34:25.014
I think you were seduced
by your English teacher

34:25.030 --> 34:26.383
when you were in high school.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.432
It's not how it happened.

34:38.440 --> 34:39.691
I just gave you a great opening
to lie one more time

34:39.710 --> 34:41.405
and you didn't take it.

34:43.440 --> 34:47.274
Look, there is no way that I can
possibly explain this to you.

34:47.280 --> 34:50.169
Then try by telling me how
you'd explain it to yourself.

34:54.350 --> 34:57.114
Okay, I used to think
what if there was a button

34:57.120 --> 35:00.624
that I could push
and all of the things

35:00.630 --> 35:04.122
that have complicated my life
would just unhappen?

35:04.130 --> 35:05.893
I would push it,
and all of the people

35:05.900 --> 35:07.458
that shouldn't have died
would still be alive.

35:07.470 --> 35:09.961
I wouldn't have hurt anyone
or disappointed them

35:09.970 --> 35:11.858
and no one would have
hurt me or lied to me

35:11.870 --> 35:14.566
and this whole mess
would just be cleaned up.

35:14.580 --> 35:17.333
But if I push that button,
I would be gone too.

35:19.280 --> 35:21.145
I am me
because of what has happened

35:21.150 --> 35:23.175
what I've done
and because of who I love.

35:26.390 --> 35:29.541
I like that person.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.949
'That me.‘

35:31.960 --> 35:33.382
Mess and all.

35:45.840 --> 35:47.933
(Alison)
Emily?'

35:47.940 --> 35:50.738
You were supposed
to wake me up.

35:50.740 --> 35:52.799
It took me longer to get here
than I thought it would.

35:54.780 --> 35:56.839
I can't move.

35:56.850 --> 36:00.013
I think
something's wrong with me.

36:00.020 --> 36:01.339
You're in the hospital.

36:03.020 --> 36:05.409
We're gonna miss our flight.

36:05.430 --> 36:06.749
We'll take the next one.

36:10.660 --> 36:13.094
Ali, you called me last night.

36:13.100 --> 36:14.522
Did I?

36:14.540 --> 36:16.098
Yeah.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.364
And you sounded scared.

36:18.370 --> 36:20.600
Like you wanted help.

36:20.610 --> 36:22.407
This is a scary place.

36:25.110 --> 36:27.169
There's this lady
that cries all night.

36:31.120 --> 36:33.042
Am I in Radley?

36:33.050 --> 36:35.189
No. No.

36:37.220 --> 36:39.359
Well, that's good.

36:39.360 --> 36:40.782
I was worried for a minute.

36:40.790 --> 36:42.189
[sighs]

36:47.030 --> 36:49.123
Mommy?

36:49.140 --> 36:51.461
'Why did you leave me?‘

36:51.470 --> 36:54.303
I woke up,
and there was dirt all over me

36:54.310 --> 36:57.131
and you wouldn't help.

36:57.140 --> 36:59.802
[crying]
Why did you leave me
in the ground?

36:59.810 --> 37:01.243
It's so cold.

37:01.250 --> 37:02.478
Alison.

37:02.480 --> 37:04.846
You were wrong about Elliot.

37:04.850 --> 37:06.738
He's not_|ike
what you said at all.

37:08.390 --> 37:10.017
What about Elliot?

37:13.090 --> 37:14.557
(Elliot)
'I didn't authorize this.'

37:14.560 --> 37:15.857
(female #1)
Uh, this lady is a relative-—

37:15.860 --> 37:18.192
_ No visitors_ _
Without my permissmn.

37:19.470 --> 37:21.597
Out. Everyone. Right now.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.534
Emily, no, don't go.

37:23.540 --> 37:24.962
. (Alison)
Emily, no!‘

37:33.910 --> 37:36.105
No!

37:36.120 --> 37:37.439
No!

37:40.290 --> 37:41.712
What happened to her?

37:41.720 --> 37:43.984
She wasn't like that
when she came here.

37:43.990 --> 37:47.153
Miss Drake,
I'd like a word with you.

37:51.770 --> 37:53.397
No one's to come in.

38:01.580 --> 38:03.400
You're not supposed
to be here.

38:03.410 --> 38:05.298
I've been calling you
for two days.

38:11.350 --> 38:13.580
[indistinct talking]

38:14.990 --> 38:17.515
Your being here
is not part of the plan.

38:17.520 --> 38:19.659
Well, neither is what
you're doing to that girl.

38:19.660 --> 38:22.458
- You've gone too far.
- You got what you wanted.

38:22.460 --> 38:25.293
- The money is yours.
- Not yet it isn't.

38:25.300 --> 38:28.861
Then stop wasting my time.

38:28.870 --> 38:31.930
Listen to me.

38:31.940 --> 38:33.339
Don't.

38:37.310 --> 38:39.175
- Hello.
- Hey.

38:41.820 --> 38:44.539
- Dad's private stock.
- Mm-hmm.

38:44.550 --> 38:45.949
Yes, it is.

38:48.520 --> 38:50.852
What's the occasion?

38:50.860 --> 38:52.953
I got fired.

38:52.960 --> 38:56.623
- What?
- By text.

38:56.630 --> 39:00.168
"You have abused the generosity
of this organization

39:00.170 --> 39:02.798
"and chosen to pursue
partisan interests

39:02.800 --> 39:04.461
over the greater good."

39:06.310 --> 39:09.336
- Well, they're wrong.
- No, they're not.

39:09.340 --> 39:11.774
I have been
rather "distracted" lately.

39:16.980 --> 39:19.471
I'm so sorry.

39:19.490 --> 39:21.685
Thanks.

39:21.690 --> 39:23.112
What are you gonna do now?

39:24.590 --> 39:26.455
I don't know, um..

39:28.830 --> 39:30.821
Stay with
my mom's transition team.

39:32.100 --> 39:35.399
Maybe go with her
to Harrisburg..

39:36.870 --> 39:39.065
...ifI can.

39:39.070 --> 39:41.607
And what would be stopping you?

39:41.610 --> 39:44.101
_ This town has
its own particular gravity.

39:44.110 --> 39:45.429
We both know that.

39:51.720 --> 39:53.119
How's Hanna?

39:55.020 --> 39:57.056
I haven't talked to her.

39:57.060 --> 39:59.312
Emily said she got a text
that she was going to New York.

40:00.960 --> 40:02.518
I guess she wanted
to see Jordan.

40:08.900 --> 40:12.358
I am afraid to ask you this,
but I really have to.

40:14.780 --> 40:16.008
Did we make a mistake?

40:17.910 --> 40:19.332
You and I?

40:20.950 --> 40:22.144
No.

40:24.150 --> 40:25.378
No, we didn't.

40:27.590 --> 40:28.989
Whatever we did,
it wasn't a mistake.

40:28.990 --> 40:30.389
It—it was real.

40:32.890 --> 40:35.324
So why are you talking about it
in the past tense?

40:39.100 --> 40:41.591
[cell phone chimes]

41:00.820 --> 41:02.287
[cell phone vibrates]

41:05.530 --> 41:07.418
[cell phone vibrates]

41:56.910 --> 41:58.537
[breathing heavily]

41:58.550 --> 42:01.576
[instrumental music]

42:20.930 --> 42:23.933
[theme music]
