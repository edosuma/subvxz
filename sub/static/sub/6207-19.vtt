<i>VIXEN: Dear Diary, being a high-powered
business president is super fun...</i>

34:58.704 --> 35:00.671
but so exhausting.

35:00.672 --> 35:03.240
Sometimes I just need to relax.

35:03.241 --> 35:06.233
I need Casa Erotica.

[DOOR KNOCKS]

35:07.646 --> 35:09.647
<i>MAN:
Room service.</i>

35:09.648 --> 35:11.382
Come in.

35:11.383 --> 35:14.752
Gabriel wanted you to guard this
with your life?

35:14.753 --> 35:18.103
Maybe he's a fan. It is a good one.

35:19.424 --> 35:22.393
I've got the kielbasa you ordered.

35:22.394 --> 35:24.695
Ohh. Polish?

35:24.696 --> 35:27.196
Hungarian.

[MOANING]

35:35.207 --> 35:38.376
- What the hell's going on?
<i>GABRIEL: So nice.</i>

35:38.377 --> 35:40.877
Sam, Dean...

35:40.979 --> 35:44.615
you're probably wondering
what the hell's going on.

35:44.616 --> 35:50.054
Well, if you're watching this,
I'm dead.

35:50.555 --> 35:55.875
Oh, please, stop sobbing.
It's embarrassing for all of us.

35:55.994 --> 36:00.494
Without me, you got zero shot
at killing Lucifer.

36:00.732 --> 36:02.133
Sorry.

36:02.134 --> 36:04.728
But you can trap him.

36:05.270 --> 36:08.739
The cage you sprung Lucifer from,
it's still down there.

36:08.740 --> 36:13.611
And maybe, just maybe,
you can shove his ass back in.

36:13.612 --> 36:15.346
Not that it'll be easy.

36:15.347 --> 36:18.616
You gotta get the cage open,
trick my bro back into it...

36:18.617 --> 36:23.350
and, oh, yeah, avoid Michael
and the God squad.

36:23.522 --> 36:26.514
But, hey, details, right?

36:27.526 --> 36:31.862
And here's the big secret
Lucifer himself doesn't even know.

36:31.863 --> 36:35.693
But the key to the cage,
it's out there.

36:35.767 --> 36:38.827
Actually, it's "keys," plural.

36:39.004 --> 36:40.271
Four keys.

36:40.272 --> 36:43.867
Well, four rings from the horsemen.

36:44.042 --> 36:47.278
You get them all, you got the cage.

36:47.279 --> 36:53.649
Can't say I'm betting on you boys,
but, hey, I've been wrong before.

36:53.685 --> 36:56.279
And, Dean, you were right.

36:56.455 --> 36:59.957
I was afraid
to stand up to my brother.

36:59.958 --> 37:02.359
But not anymore.

37:02.360 --> 37:05.329
So this is me standing up...

37:05.897 --> 37:09.526
and this is me lying down.

[GROWLS]

- My goodness. You're naughty.
- Oh. Oh, man.

37:19.978 --> 37:22.478
Horsemen, huh?

37:22.981 --> 37:25.481
Well, we got War's.

37:28.086 --> 37:30.586
We nicked Famine's.

37:31.022 --> 37:33.724
That's two rings down.
Collect all four?

37:33.725 --> 37:37.862
- All we need is Pestilence and Death.
<i>SAM: Oh, is that all?</i>

37:37.863 --> 37:40.363
It's a plan.

Does this stuff make you drowsy?
I've got a lot of driving to do.

38:47.299 --> 38:49.567
Blue ones make you sleepy.

38:49.568 --> 38:53.378
Red and orange ones are okay
for daytime.
