WEBVTT

01:40.391 --> 01:41.642
WE CHOPPED AND
STACKED A WHOLE BUNCH
OF WOOD FOR YOU.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.019
MORE THAN
TWO CORDS.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.562
I'LL LOAD
IT TOMORROW.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.898
THAT'S AS MUCH A DAY'S WORK
AS A MAN COULD EXPECT,

01:48.066 --> 01:48.607
ESPECIALLY FROM A
COUPLE OF YOUNG'UNS.

01:48.775 --> 01:51.276
THANK YOU,
MR. CAULDER.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.654
NOW, BOYS...

01:53.822 --> 01:56.073
I GOT THAT NORTH PASTURE
TO START CLEARING.

01:56.241 --> 01:56.490
NOW, IF YOU HAVE
A MIND TO...

01:56.658 --> 01:58.492
YES, SIR.

01:58.660 --> 02:00.244
Mr. Caulder: SAME WAGES,
20 CENTS A DAY EACH.

02:00.411 --> 02:01.995
OH, WE'D LIKE
THAT FINE.

02:02.163 --> 02:04.498
I'LL EXPECT YOU BOTH
BRIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.334
Mr. Caulder:
FOR YOU...

02:07.502 --> 02:08.710
THANK YOU.

02:08.878 --> 02:10.295
Mr. Caulder: BEST YOU
BOYS BE RUNNING ON.

02:10.463 --> 02:10.921
YOU'LL BE LATE
FOR SUPPER.

02:11.089 --> 02:12.631
BYE, MR.
CAULDER.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.216
SEE YOU TOMORROW!

02:18.429 --> 02:19.513
Andy: GETTING SO
WE'RE FINDING WORK
MOST EVERY DAY.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.640
Albert: YEAH.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.600
IF THINGS KEEP GOING
THE WAY THEY ARE,

02:23.768 --> 02:26.895
WE COULD END UP
SAVING AN AWFUL LOT
BEFORE SUMMER'S OUT.

02:27.063 --> 02:27.688
Andy: HOW MUCH, YOU THINK?

02:27.856 --> 02:32.359
Albert: HMM...
10, MAYBE $12,

02:32.527 --> 02:33.777
EVEN MORE IF WE
WORK 6-DAY WEEKS.

02:33.945 --> 02:36.405
Andy: WHAT WILL
YOU SPEND YOURS ON?

02:36.573 --> 02:38.365
Albert: DON'T RIGHTLY KNOW.

02:38.533 --> 02:41.118
JUST KIND OF LIKE
THAT FEELING THAT
IT'S ALL PILING UP.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.578
Andy: YEAH, ME TOO.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.080
Albert: SEE YOU TOMORROW!

02:45.248 --> 02:46.373
Andy: BYE!

02:52.463 --> 02:52.796
Laura: IT JUST
ISN'T FAIR.

02:52.964 --> 02:54.798
I QUITE AGREE.

02:54.966 --> 02:55.799
Charles: WELL,
I'LL TELL YOU, IT'S
PARTIALLY MY FAULT.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.093
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY
DOING MY WORK,

02:58.261 --> 02:59.678
I HAVEN'T BEEN
KEEPING AN EYE
ON HIM,

02:59.846 --> 03:01.430
MAKING SURE HE'S
DOING HIS CHORES.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.723
Caroline: WELL, I
THINK IT'S TIME WE GOT IT
SETTLED ONCE AND FOR ALL.

03:02.891 --> 03:05.100
OH, DON'T YOU
WORRY, I WILL.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.393
THANK YOU,
CARRIE.

03:06.561 --> 03:10.355
I COULD TELL WHAT
YOU WERE COOKING
HALFWAY UP THE ROAD.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.482
MMM...HUNGRY
AS A BEAR.

03:12.650 --> 03:18.488
ANDY AND ME MUST HAVE
CHOPPED AND STACKED
OVER TWO CORDS TODAY.

03:18.656 --> 03:19.698
SOMETHING
THE MATTER?

03:19.866 --> 03:21.116
NO, BUT I'D
LIKE YOU TO
GO UPSTAIRS,

03:21.284 --> 03:23.118
TAKE A LOOK AT
YOUR PART OF THE
LOFT, PLEASE.

03:23.286 --> 03:24.328
WHY?

03:24.495 --> 03:26.413
JUST DO IT.

03:26.581 --> 03:27.289
SURE.

03:31.002 --> 03:34.504
ALL RIGHT,
I'M LOOKING.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.298
DO YOU SEE
ANYTHING WRONG?

03:36.466 --> 03:37.549
WRONG?

03:37.717 --> 03:38.342
WRONG.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.140
NOPE, JUST THE
WAY I LEFT IT.

03:45.308 --> 03:47.351
Charles: WELL, THAT
HAPPENS TO BE OUR PROBLEM.

03:47.518 --> 03:48.727
HUH?

03:48.895 --> 03:51.188
THE BED ISN'T MADE, THE
WHOLE PLACE IS A MESS.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.190
AND IT'S STARTING
TO SMELL BAD.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.109
WELL, BUT I LIKE
IT THAT WAY.

03:56.277 --> 03:59.196
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T LEAVE
FOOD LYING AROUND, BUT...

03:59.364 --> 04:01.365
WELL, LIKE,
MAKING THE BED.

04:01.532 --> 04:03.492
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

04:03.660 --> 04:05.410
Albert: I HAVE TO MESS
IT UP WHEN I GO TO SLEEP,

04:05.578 --> 04:09.539
AND, WELL, THAT'S PRACTICALLY
THE ONLY TIME I'M UP THERE.

04:09.707 --> 04:12.668
ALBERT, WHEN THIS
MANY PEOPLE LIVE

04:12.835 --> 04:15.379
IN SUCH A VERY
SMALL HOUSE...

04:15.546 --> 04:16.755
WELL, IF ONE PERSON
IS DELIBERATELY MESSY,

04:16.923 --> 04:19.299
THEN EVERYONE SUFFERS.

04:19.467 --> 04:20.175
NOW, KEEPING YOUR
PART OF THE HOUSE NEAT

04:20.343 --> 04:21.718
IS ONE OF THE
RULES AROUND HERE.

04:21.886 --> 04:24.096
WELL, SURE, BUT--

04:24.264 --> 04:24.513
NO BUTS.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.515
LOOK...

04:26.683 --> 04:27.766
LOOK? YOU
WANT TO LOOK?

04:27.934 --> 04:29.351
YOU COME ON OUTSIDE
WITH ME, WE'RE
GOING TO LOOK.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.773
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN
NEGLECTING YOUR
CHORES OUTSIDE, TOO.

04:34.941 --> 04:37.192
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
A LOOK AT THIS
CHICKEN COOP.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.736
YOU MEAN, YOU
REALLY EXPECT ME
TO DO ALL THAT

04:39.904 --> 04:40.988
BESIDES PUTTING IN
A HARD DAY'S WORK?

04:41.155 --> 04:42.239
OF COURSE I DO!

04:42.407 --> 04:43.073
I NEVER ASKED
YOU TO PUT IN A
HARD DAY'S WORK

04:43.241 --> 04:44.283
AT SOMEBODY
ELSE'S PLACE.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.368
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO
WORK ALL THE TIME
FOR ANYWAY?

04:46.536 --> 04:47.744
IT'S SUMMER
VACATION.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.081
WELL, ISN'T VACATION
A TIME WHEN PEOPLE
DO WHAT THEY WANT?

04:51.249 --> 04:52.791
EXACTLY, OF
COURSE IT IS.

04:52.959 --> 04:57.129
THEN WHY SHOULDN'T
I WORK IF THAT'S
WHAT I WANT?

04:57.297 --> 04:57.879
WELL, NO REASON AT
ALL, AS LONG AS YOU
DO YOUR CHORES AND

04:58.047 --> 05:00.007
YOU KEEP THE
LOFT CLEAN.

05:00.174 --> 05:01.300
NOW, COME ON,
CLEAN UP THE COOP.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.051
DO YOU HAVE TO
DO THOSE KINDS
OF THINGS

05:03.219 --> 05:03.927
WHEN YOU COME HOME
FROM A DAY'S WORK?

05:04.095 --> 05:06.263
OF COURSE
I DON'T.

05:06.431 --> 05:07.389
WHY?

05:07.557 --> 05:09.599
BECAUSE IT'S
DIFFERENT,
THAT'S WHY.

05:09.767 --> 05:11.560
IN WHAT WAY?

05:11.728 --> 05:13.812
ALBERT, TRY TO
UNDERSTAND, I'M
SUPPORTING A FAMILY.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.731
I'M DOING
A MAN'S WORK.

05:15.898 --> 05:17.607
IS CHOPPING
FIREWOOD MAN'S WORK?

05:17.775 --> 05:19.484
SURE.

05:19.652 --> 05:21.445
IS CLEARING
A PASTURE
MAN'S WORK?

05:21.612 --> 05:22.612
Charles:
YEAH.

05:22.780 --> 05:24.698
IS PLOWING A FIELD
MAN'S WORK?

05:24.866 --> 05:26.199
OF COURSE IT IS.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.327
Albert: WELL, THAT'S
WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING.

05:28.494 --> 05:30.162
SO, IF I CAN DO
THE WORK OF A MAN,

05:30.330 --> 05:33.373
I SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT
TO BE TREATED LIKE ONE.

05:33.541 --> 05:33.999
ALBERT, I--I AM
THE MAN AROUND HERE,

05:34.167 --> 05:36.335
AND YOU DO WHAT I SAY.

05:36.502 --> 05:38.420
Charles: IF YOU WANT
TO WORK, YOU WORK FOR
ME, AND I'LL PAY YOU.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.297
NO, THAT WOULD
WRECK EVERYTHING.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.381
WHY?

05:41.549 --> 05:43.258
Albert: BECAUSE
IT'S AN ALLOWANCE,

05:43.426 --> 05:44.760
AND ALLOWANCES
ARE FOR KIDS.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.262
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU?

05:47.430 --> 05:49.431
I'M A MAN, AND
YOU JUST SAID SO.

05:49.599 --> 05:50.557
I DID NOT.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.684
YOU SAID A
MAN CHOPS WOOD,
CLEARS AND PLOWS--

05:52.852 --> 05:54.102
CLEAN THE
COOP, ALBERT.

05:54.270 --> 05:56.480
COME ON, CLEAN
THE COOP.

05:56.647 --> 05:57.564
GROWN-UPS...

05:57.732 --> 06:00.442
WHENEVER THEY'RE WRONG,
THEY YELL AT YOU.

06:00.610 --> 06:02.194
JUST CLEAN THE COOP!

06:02.362 --> 06:03.528
BUT I ALREADY
TOLD MR. CAULDER

06:03.696 --> 06:04.654
I'D KEEP ON
WORKING FOR HIM.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.740
NO.

06:06.908 --> 06:09.242
ALICE,
LOOKING BACK,

06:09.410 --> 06:10.786
EVEN BEFORE I WAS
AS OLD AS ANDY,

06:10.953 --> 06:12.162
I WAS ALREADY
DOING A MAN'S WORK.

06:12.330 --> 06:12.704
THE BOY AIN'T NO
DIFFERENT THAN ME.

06:12.872 --> 06:15.290
OH, YES,
HE IS.

06:15.458 --> 06:16.500
WELL, HOW?

06:16.667 --> 06:18.502
WHEN YOU WERE
HIS AGE, THERE
WAS NO SCHOOL.

06:18.669 --> 06:20.462
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
STOP BEING A MAN AT
THE END OF EVERY SUMMER

06:20.630 --> 06:21.671
AND GO BACK
TO BEING A BOY,

06:21.839 --> 06:23.965
A BOY WITH
SCHOOLWORK
AND CHORES.

06:24.133 --> 06:26.385
THE BOYS UNDERSTAND
THAT THIS IS JUST
FOR THE SUMMER.

06:26.552 --> 06:27.844
AIN'T THAT
RIGHT, SON?

06:28.012 --> 06:30.722
WELL, NOT GETTING
EDUCATED DIDN'T
HURT YOU NONE, PA.

06:30.890 --> 06:31.807
CAN'T SEE WHY IT
WOULDN'T HURT
ME NEITHER.

06:31.974 --> 06:34.768
THERE,
YOU SEE?

06:34.936 --> 06:36.269
NOW, WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

06:36.437 --> 06:38.814
I'VE BEEN
MEANING TO TALK
TO YOU ABOUT IT.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.357
ABOUT WHAT?

06:40.525 --> 06:43.276
WELL, SINCE I CAN
DO A MAN'S WORK,

06:43.444 --> 06:45.612
I DON'T SEE NO NEED
TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

06:45.780 --> 06:47.781
"ANY" NEED.

06:47.949 --> 06:50.200
NOW, YOU SEE THE
KIND OF IDEA YOU
PUT INTO HIS HEAD?

06:50.368 --> 06:51.535
I DID NO SUCH THING.

06:51.702 --> 06:53.912
SON, WHEN I WAS
YOUR AGE, THERE
WEREN'T NO SCHOOL,

06:54.080 --> 06:55.956
AND I DIDN'T
HAVE A CHANCE
FOR AN EDUCATION.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.457
Jonathan: YOU'RE
GOING TO HAVE
THAT CHANCE.

06:57.625 --> 06:58.834
SO?

06:59.001 --> 06:59.751
OH, "SEW" BUTTONS
ON YOUR SHIRT!

06:59.919 --> 07:02.045
GO TO YOUR ROOM.

07:05.133 --> 07:06.091
YOU ALWAYS SAID YOU'D
BE SO PROUD OF ME

07:06.259 --> 07:08.927
IF I EVER GREW UP
TO BE LIKE PA,

07:09.095 --> 07:12.097
AND WHEN I WANT TO,
YOU SEND ME TO MY ROOM.

07:23.484 --> 07:24.359
AFTER SUPPER, I'LL...

07:24.527 --> 07:26.736
I'LL GO OVER TO
THE INGALLS' PLACE

07:26.904 --> 07:30.699
AND TELL ALBERT THAT
ANDY AIN'T GOING TO BE
WORKING WITH HIM ANYMORE.

07:47.258 --> 07:49.509
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE ANSWER
IS, CHARLES.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.261
SEEMS KIND OF
WRONG TELLING
A BOY NO

07:51.429 --> 07:53.388
AND NOT
TELLING HIM
THE WHY OF IT.

07:53.556 --> 07:54.639
WELL, LET THEM HAVE
THEIR OWN WAY, AND
YOU KNOW WHAT WE GOT.

07:54.807 --> 07:57.100
A COUPLE OF LITTLE
BOYS ACTING LIKE
LORDS OF THE MANOR

07:57.268 --> 07:58.518
BECAUSE THEY EARNED
A DAY'S WAGES.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.020
YEAH, I
SUPPOSE SO.

08:00.188 --> 08:01.438
WELL, THEY'RE
GOING TO FIND OUT

08:01.606 --> 08:03.440
THERE'S A MIGHTY
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
SAYING YOU'RE A MAN

08:03.608 --> 08:04.983
- AND BEING ONE.
- ALL RIGHT.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.651
PULL THAT LIGHT
OVER HERE FOR ME,
WILL YOU?

08:06.819 --> 08:10.780
YEAH.
FUNNY THING, WHEN
I WAS THAT SAME AGE,

08:10.948 --> 08:13.575
I WAS EXACTLY
THE WAY THEY ARE.

08:13.743 --> 08:14.701
YEAH, ME TOO.
COULDN'T WAIT
TO BE A MAN.

08:14.869 --> 08:17.287
YEAH.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.372
I REMEMBER
ONE TIME...

08:19.540 --> 08:22.083
I WAS FEELING
SO FULL OF MYSELF

08:22.251 --> 08:25.754
I TOOK ON SOMETHING
MY PA SAID I WASN'T
READY FOR.

08:25.922 --> 08:27.797
OLD TRAPPER GOT
HIS-SELF KICKED IN
THE HEAD BY A MULE.

08:27.965 --> 08:30.342
HIS EYES SWELLED UP,

08:30.510 --> 08:32.928
HE WANTED TO HIRE
ME TO RUN HIS LINES
WHILE HE WAS MENDING.

08:33.095 --> 08:35.597
YOU KNOW, COLLECTING
AND BAITING AND SUCH.

08:35.765 --> 08:38.475
MEANT 3 DAYS AND 3 NIGHTS
OUT THERE, ALL ALONE.

08:38.643 --> 08:42.103
Jonathan: HA, MY PA,
HE ARGUED HARD AND...

08:42.271 --> 08:45.649
HE FINALLY JUST UP AND
SAID, "GO AHEAD AND GO."

08:45.816 --> 08:46.900
HA, WELL, I DON'T
HAVE TO TELL YOU

08:47.068 --> 08:51.821
THOSE WERE 3 OF THE LONGEST,
LONELIEST NIGHTS OF MY LIFE.

08:51.989 --> 08:55.617
HA HA!

08:55.785 --> 08:57.285
YEAH...SOMETHING
ABOUT BEING OUT THERE

08:57.453 --> 08:59.496
ALL ALONE IN
THE WILDERNESS

08:59.664 --> 09:01.081
KNOCK A HOLE
IN THE WAY A
SWELLED-UP YOUNG MAN

09:01.249 --> 09:04.000
IS FEELING
ABOUT HIMSELF.

09:04.168 --> 09:06.503
MOTHER NATURE
KIND OF HAS A WAY OF
DOING THAT, CHARLES.

09:06.671 --> 09:08.838
YOU KNOW, IT WASN'T
UNTIL A COUPLE YEARS LATER

09:09.006 --> 09:12.842
I FOUND OUT THAT MY PA HAD
FOLLOWED ME THOSE 3 DAYS

09:13.010 --> 09:16.930
JUST TO MAKE SURE
NO HURT COME TO ME.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.683
JONATHAN, I
THINK THAT'S IT.

09:19.850 --> 09:20.976
YOU THINK
THAT'S WHAT?

09:21.143 --> 09:24.187
PUT THE BOYS THROUGH
SOMETHING LIKE YOU
WENT THROUGH.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.523
YOU MEAN KIND
OF LIKE A TEST?

09:26.691 --> 09:27.482
Charles: SURE.

09:27.650 --> 09:28.858
YOU KNOW THAT ROAD
TO SLEEPY EYE.

09:29.026 --> 09:30.694
THAT WINDS AROUND
SOME OF THE ROUGHEST
COUNTRY IN THE STATE.

09:30.861 --> 09:32.612
Charles: NOW, IF
WE SENT THE BOYS--

09:32.780 --> 09:35.532
NOW, CHARLES, WE CAN'T DO
THAT, THAT AIN'T NO FAIR
TEST, THEY'D NEVER MAKE IT.

09:35.700 --> 09:36.866
WELL, I KNOW.

09:37.034 --> 09:39.536
BUT THEY WOULD
LEARN A FEW THINGS,
WOULDN'T THEY?

09:42.039 --> 09:43.456
Jonathan:
DO YOU THINK
THEY'D GO FOR IT?

09:43.624 --> 09:45.667
WELL, YOU DID.

09:45.835 --> 09:47.502
Charles:
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

09:47.670 --> 09:49.796
I THINK THAT'S
DOWNRIGHT MEAN.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.798
LET'S DO IT.

09:51.966 --> 09:53.091
YEAH, LET'S.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.676
HA HA!

09:54.844 --> 09:57.304
HA HA HA!

09:59.056 --> 10:01.057
Charles: DON'T LET ME FORGET
TO GIVE YOU YOUR BEEF JERKY.

10:01.225 --> 10:02.559
Andy: IS THAT
ALL WE GET?

10:02.727 --> 10:04.561
Jonathan: WELL, IT'S
PART OF THE TEST, SON.

10:04.729 --> 10:07.022

WITH ALL THE FOOD
SHE PACKED US.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.529
CAN'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT IT AFTER
THAT BREAKFAST.

35:15.696 --> 35:17.030
YEAH.

36:33.482 --> 36:35.108
LOOK
AT THAT.

36:35.276 --> 36:38.320
THAT CAN'T
BE THE STREAM
WE CROSSED.

36:38.487 --> 36:40.238
THE RAIN MUST
HAVE DONE IT.

36:40.406 --> 36:43.200
WELL, HOW ARE
WE GOING TO
GET ACROSS IT?

36:43.367 --> 36:45.702
DON'T KNOW.

36:45.870 --> 36:48.038
WE'LL HAVE TO
THINK OF SOMETHING.

36:48.206 --> 36:48.788
RAIN'S GOT
THAT RIVER
RUNNING HIGH.

36:48.956 --> 36:51.583
I THINK WE
GOT THEM NOW.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.335
YEAH, THEY'RE
NEVER GOING TO
GET ACROSS THAT.

36:53.502 --> 36:54.669
THEY'LL HAVE TO GO
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO SLEEPY EYE

36:54.837 --> 36:57.380
AND THEN DOUBLE
AROUND ON THAT ROAD
AND USE THE BRIDGE.

36:57.548 --> 37:00.383
AND WE JUST COME
BACK AND CATCH
THEM CHEATING.

37:00.551 --> 37:01.968
I THINK WE
GOT THEM...

37:02.136 --> 37:04.429
IF WE DON'T STARVE
TO DEATH FIRST.

37:04.597 --> 37:06.139
Albert: LET'S
CHECK DOWNSTREAM.

37:14.690 --> 37:17.359
HA! WE GOT THEM.

37:23.491 --> 37:25.742
Albert: HEY,
LOOK AT THAT!

37:25.910 --> 37:27.244
COME ON!

37:38.673 --> 37:40.507
WE CAN GET
ACROSS THAT EASY.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.259
IT SURE DOESN'T
LOOK EASY TO ME.

37:42.426 --> 37:44.886
AH, SURE IT DOES.
COME ON.

37:59.568 --> 38:01.528
DAD BURN IT!

38:01.696 --> 38:03.571
WHY'D THAT TREE HAVE
TO FALL RIGHT THERE?

38:03.739 --> 38:06.783
CHARLES, IT LOOKS
LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO
MAKE IT ACROSS THERE.

38:15.960 --> 38:17.210
OH, NO.

38:17.378 --> 38:20.005
CAN'T THEY JUST GET
WET OR SOMETHING?

38:29.724 --> 38:31.850
COME ON.

38:33.602 --> 38:35.312
DAD-BURNED KIDS.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.274
ALL RIGHT.

38:39.442 --> 38:40.191
CHARLES, ARE
YOU SURE WE CAN
GET ACROSS THIS?

38:40.359 --> 38:42.360
OF COURSE
WE CAN GET
ACROSS THIS.

38:42.528 --> 38:43.611
WHAT ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT, ANYWAY?

38:43.779 --> 38:44.863
YOU'RE TALLER
THAN I AM.

38:45.031 --> 38:46.197
WHAT'S THAT GOT
TO DO WITH IT?

38:46.365 --> 38:48.450
I DON'T KNOW, I'M
DELIRIOUS FROM
HUNGER. COME ON.

39:10.681 --> 39:11.431
AAH!

39:11.599 --> 39:13.850
HEY, NO!

40:15.246 --> 40:19.624
CHARLES, I'M SORRY
I GRABBED YOU.

40:19.792 --> 40:21.167
YOU OWE ME A HAT.

40:40.020 --> 40:41.855
I DON'T THINK WE
CAME THIS WAY.

40:42.022 --> 40:42.981
HMM, ME
NEITHER.

40:43.149 --> 40:45.233
LET'S TRY
THAT WAY.

40:45.401 --> 40:46.818
WE CAN'T BE
FAR OFF TRACK.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.700
Charles: DIDN'T
REALIZE WE GOT CARRIED
SO FAR DOWNSTREAM.

40:53.868 --> 40:55.743
Jonathan: YEAH, I HOPE
WE CAN PICK UP THEIR
TRAIL PRETTY QUICK.

40:55.911 --> 40:58.496
Charles: WE'LL JUST
KEEP PUSHING ON IN THAT
GENERAL DIRECTION,

40:58.664 --> 41:00.206
AND HOPE TO SPOT
THEIR CAMPFIRE.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.380
I'LL BE GLAD WHEN
THIS IS OVER.

41:07.548 --> 41:11.801
OH, MY WHOLE
FOOT'S JUST ONE
BIG BLISTER.

41:11.969 --> 41:13.511
YEAH.

41:13.679 --> 41:16.931
YOU KNOW, I STILL
DON'T THINK WE
CAME THIS WAY.

41:17.099 --> 41:19.184
OH, WHAT'S THE
DIFFERENCE?

41:19.351 --> 41:21.269
WE'RE MOST OF
THE WAY BACK
ALREADY.

41:21.437 --> 41:21.603
HOW LOST
CAN WE GET?

41:21.770 --> 41:22.770
YEAH.

41:22.938 --> 41:25.482
[TWIG SNAPS]

41:25.649 --> 41:26.941
WHAT WAS THAT?

41:27.109 --> 41:28.651
WHAT?

41:28.819 --> 41:29.861
I HEARD SOMETHING.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.446
[SNAP]

41:31.614 --> 41:33.990
THERE IT IS AGAIN.

41:34.158 --> 41:36.534
JUST SOME ANIMAL.

41:36.702 --> 41:38.661
HE WON'T COME
NEAR THE FIRE.

41:38.829 --> 41:40.538
YEAH.

41:40.706 --> 41:41.831
THAT'S RIGHT.

41:47.671 --> 41:48.755
HMM...

41:48.923 --> 41:52.091
BET OUR FOLKS
ARE GOING TO BE
SURPRISED TOMORROW.

41:52.259 --> 41:54.010
I DON'T THINK
THEY FIGURED
WE COULD DO IT.

41:54.178 --> 41:57.514
I HAD THAT
FEELING MYSELF.

41:57.681 --> 41:59.474
AND LOOK
AT US NOW.

41:59.642 --> 42:03.978
WASN'T EASY, BUT
WASN'T ALL THAT
HARD EITHER.

42:04.146 --> 42:05.980
HOW MANY BOYS
OUR AGE COULD
HAVE DONE IT?

42:06.148 --> 42:09.025
NOT MANY. NOT
MANY GROWN-UPS
NEITHER.

42:09.193 --> 42:10.735
THAT'S RIGHT.

42:10.903 --> 42:12.904
WE HANDLED
EVERYTHING
JUST RIGHT.

42:13.072 --> 42:15.406
EVEN THAT
STORY ABOUT US
BEING ORPHANS.

42:15.574 --> 42:17.784
WELL, THAT'S
ALL PART OF IT.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.661
WOUND UP MAKING
US FEELING GOOD

42:19.828 --> 42:22.330
AND HER
FEELING GOOD.

42:22.498 --> 42:24.332
YOU HANDLED
YOUR PART JUST
RIGHT, TOO.

42:24.500 --> 42:26.292
NOT AS GOOD
AS YOU.

42:26.460 --> 42:29.087
WELL, THE WHOLE
POINT IS...

42:29.255 --> 42:31.464
I THINK WE PROVED
THAT WE CAN TAKE ON

42:31.632 --> 42:33.883
JUST ABOUT ANYTHING
LIFE HANDS US.

42:35.678 --> 42:38.429
[CRAZED LAUGHTER]

HA HA HA!

42:48.023 --> 42:50.483
OOH, HA HA HA!

43:14.717 --> 43:15.800
WHAT WAS THAT?

43:15.968 --> 43:17.719
I DON'T KNOW,
AND I DON'T WANT
TO FIND OUT.

43:17.886 --> 43:18.761
OH, ME NEITHER.

43:18.929 --> 43:20.722
OH, NO.

43:20.889 --> 43:22.098
WHAT IS IT?

43:22.266 --> 43:24.309
THE LETTER,
THE LETTER WAS
BACK THERE.

43:24.476 --> 43:26.060
THEY'LL NEVER
BELIEVE US NOW.

43:26.228 --> 43:27.520
WE HAVE
TO GO BACK.

43:27.688 --> 43:30.398
I'M NOT
GOING BACK.

43:30.566 --> 43:31.733
ME NEITHER.

43:31.900 --> 43:33.359
COME ON.

43:37.239 --> 43:38.823
CHARLES, OVER HERE!

43:43.120 --> 43:45.079
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S
HAPPENED HERE.

43:45.247 --> 43:47.749
ALBERT!

43:47.916 --> 43:51.753
ANDY!

43:51.920 --> 43:54.422
CHARLES.

43:54.590 --> 43:56.215
Jonathan:
IT'S THE LETTER.

43:58.969 --> 44:03.598
THEY WOULDN'T HAVE LEFT
THAT BEHIND UNLESS SOMETHING
TERRIBLE HAPPENED HERE.

44:03.766 --> 44:05.933
NO USE WASTING OUR
TIME TRYING TO FIND
THEM IN THE DARK.

44:06.101 --> 44:07.727
LET'S GET TO TOWN,
ROUND UP A SEARCH PARTY.

44:13.025 --> 44:14.150
Charles: CAROLINE!

44:14.318 --> 44:16.903
Caroline:
ALICE, THEY'RE BACK!

44:17.071 --> 44:18.863
OH, CHARLES.

44:19.031 --> 44:22.742
Caroline: OH, CHARLES,
WE'VE BEEN BESIDE OURSELVES.

44:22.910 --> 44:25.078
NOW, LISTEN, I WANT YOU
TO TRY NOT TO WORRY.
WE LOST THE BOYS.

44:25.245 --> 44:26.829
BUT WE'RE GOING
TO GET A SEARCH
PARTY OUT,

44:26.997 --> 44:28.039
AND WE'RE GOING
TO FIND THEM.

44:28.207 --> 44:30.083
CHARLES, WE
WEREN'T WORRIED
ABOUT THE BOYS.

44:30.250 --> 44:31.584
THEY'VE BEEN
BACK FOR HOURS.

44:31.752 --> 44:33.461
WE WERE WORRIED
ABOUT YOU.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.713
OH, THANK GOD.

44:35.881 --> 44:37.465
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU?

44:37.633 --> 44:38.966
IT'S A LONG STORY.

44:39.134 --> 44:40.134
WHERE ARE THEY?

44:40.302 --> 44:42.970
IN THE BARN,
WE HEATED SOME
WATER FOR A BATH.

44:43.138 --> 44:47.767
I JUST TOLD THEM THAT
YOU GOT WORRIED AND
WENT LOOKING FOR THEM.

44:47.935 --> 44:49.310
COME ON.

45:09.540 --> 45:12.375
WE DON'T HAVE
ANY PROOF...

45:12.543 --> 45:14.460
BUT WE GOT ALL THE
WAY THERE AND BACK.

45:14.628 --> 45:16.671
AND WE PICKED UP
THE LETTER, TOO.

45:16.839 --> 45:19.674
YEAH, BUT
WE LOST IT.

45:19.842 --> 45:20.967
LOST THE
LETTER, HUH?

45:21.135 --> 45:22.593
YEAH.

45:22.761 --> 45:25.513
I DON'T BLAME
YOU FOR NOT
BELIEVING US.

45:25.681 --> 45:27.181
WE FAILED
THE TEST.

45:31.019 --> 45:32.687
THAT THE LETTER
YOU LOST?

45:32.855 --> 45:36.107
HOW'D YOU
GET THAT?

45:36.275 --> 45:38.651

FOLLOWED US?

Charles: SEE, WE NEVER
FIGURED YOU'D MAKE IT
IN THE FIRST PLACE,

45:44.783 --> 45:46.701
SO, WE THOUGHT
WE'D BETTER KEEP
AN EYE ON YOU,

45:46.869 --> 45:50.788
JUST IN CASE YOU
GOT IN TROUBLE.

45:50.956 --> 45:53.875
WE WANTED TO
TEACH YOU A LESSON.

45:54.042 --> 45:57.044
WE FELT LIKE WE
WERE DOING IT FOR
YOUR OWN GOOD.

45:57.212 --> 46:00.673

KEEPING YOUR SIDE
OF THE BARGAIN.

46:00.841 --> 46:04.177
WELL, WE'LL KEEP
OUR SIDE OF IT, TOO.

46:04.344 --> 46:06.304
FROM NOW ON, YOU'LL
BE TREATED LIKE MEN.

46:12.144 --> 46:14.353
DIDN'T THINK I MEANT
THAT MUCH TO YOU.

46:16.231 --> 46:18.107
WELL, OF
COURSE YOU DO.

46:21.069 --> 46:24.071
THAT GOES FOR
ME, TOO, SON.

46:24.239 --> 46:25.740
YOU KNOW, PA...

46:25.908 --> 46:30.745
I DON'T CARE SO
MUCH ABOUT BEING
A MAN JUST YET.

46:30.913 --> 46:33.539
ME NEITHER.

46:33.707 --> 46:35.833
KIND OF JUST LIKE
BEING YOUR BOY.

46:48.764 --> 46:50.723
I DON'T SUPPOSE
ANYBODY'S HUNGRY.

46:50.891 --> 46:52.975

NO TIME FOR
JOKES, WOMAN.

ON THE TABLE

46:57.439 --> 46:59.857
WHILE ALL YOU
LITTLE BOYS
WASH UP.

47:15.374 --> 47:17.959
Laura: THINGS WERE A
LOT DIFFERENT AFTER THAT.

47:18.126 --> 47:20.294
ANDY DECIDED TO
GO BACK TO SCHOOL,

47:20.462 --> 47:24.799
AND ALBERT FIGURED IT WAS
MORE FUN TO GO FISHING
THAN WORK ALL SUMMER...

47:24.967 --> 47:26.801
ESPECIALLY WITH PA.
