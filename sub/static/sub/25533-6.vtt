-[Helen] Oh, he's eating.
-[Phil] Mm.

00:21.521 --> 00:22.772
Can you hear me?

00:22.856 --> 00:24.232
Mm.

00:24.315 --> 00:25.442
[Helen] Do you hear me?

00:25.525 --> 00:26.735
-[Max] Hello!
-Oh, my God.

00:26.818 --> 00:29.404
That is so good. It's so good.

00:30.905 --> 00:31.948
[Helen] Where is he going?

00:32.282 --> 00:33.491
[Max] You have to move back.

00:34.034 --> 00:35.952
Max, leave me alone, please.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.204
-You have to try this. It's fantastic.
-Here.

00:39.122 --> 00:40.832
-Which one?
-I got them from Breads.

00:40.915 --> 00:43.293
-Which one should I try?
-Whichever you like.

00:43.376 --> 00:44.919
Well, are you going to eat it now?

00:45.378 --> 00:46.421
Why not? It's so good.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.341
I got the chocolate and this one is
the cinnamon. You like it?

00:50.425 --> 00:52.969
-Mm.
-All right. All right. Goodbye.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.512

[Phil] I used to work
in Times Square in the early '80s.

01:57.492 --> 01:59.828
And I ate pizza, hot dogs for dinner.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.204
That's what I could afford.

02:01.329 --> 02:04.958
So I usually looked
for where the deals were

02:05.041 --> 02:07.293
and so there was this deli.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.421
I remember it said, "Chicken, 3.25,"

02:10.505 --> 02:13.007
so I said to the guy,
"I'll have the chicken."

02:13.091 --> 02:15.385
It was like half a chicken for 3.25.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.886
Again, early '80s.

02:16.970 --> 02:19.097
And he goes "You want potato?"

02:19.180 --> 02:21.766
I hesitated because I knew
that would be extra.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.727
And he goes, "It's okay. It go with it."

02:24.811 --> 02:28.106
And I said, "Oh, great.
Then I'll take potato."

02:28.189 --> 02:31.651
And so I moved down the line and then
the guy's ringing me up at the end

02:31.734 --> 02:35.989
and he goes, "Chicken, 3.25.
Potato, that's 4.75."

02:36.072 --> 02:40.952
And I said, "Oh. The man said
that the potato would go with it."

02:41.035 --> 02:44.455
And he said, "Yeah, it go with it.
It don't come with it."

02:48.334 --> 02:49.377
That's New York to me.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.297
You're getting ripped off
and you enjoy it.

02:52.380 --> 02:54.549
That's New York. [chuckles]

02:56.009 --> 02:58.344
This is the center of the world.

02:58.428 --> 03:00.972
New York is the center
of the known universe.

03:01.639 --> 03:02.640
Just a fact.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.477
Now, there have been
countless shows about New York

03:06.561 --> 03:09.772
and I'd be crazy to say
that this one's the definitive New York.

03:10.315 --> 03:12.150
But I can show you my New York.

03:12.358 --> 03:15.069
This is the New York I lived in
for the whole first half of my life.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.988
The New York I keep coming back to.

03:17.614 --> 03:18.907
The New York I love.

03:21.910 --> 03:24.704
Like the place that taught me
what great steak is.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.666
This is a steakhouse from 1887.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.210
It's called Peter Luger's.

03:30.877 --> 03:32.712
It's in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.

03:32.795 --> 03:34.464
It's a reason to come to New York.

03:35.089 --> 03:38.426
Today, special guest star,
my friend from Modena,

03:38.509 --> 03:41.429
one of the greatest chefs in the world,
Massimo Bottura.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.974
I've been coming here for 30 years,
I've never seen this.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.019
[Phil] I only dreamed about such a place.

03:48.102 --> 03:49.103
-Right?
-[Massimo] Me too.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.688
Never been in a place like this.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.440
-Amazing, right?
-Never. Never. Never.

03:52.982 --> 03:54.984
[Phil] They let us go down
into the meat locker.

03:55.568 --> 03:58.321
There's about half a million dollars worth
of meat in this room.

03:58.404 --> 04:00.281
[Phil] Massimo, we're going
to plan the heist.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.991
[both laugh]

04:02.075 --> 04:04.869
[Phil] All this meat
is one month's supply.

04:05.703 --> 04:08.790
[Phil] Don't leave the kitchen
if the steak isn't sizzling.

04:09.999 --> 04:13.920
Also with us is my dear friend,
world-famous chef Nancy Silverton.

04:14.003 --> 04:18.007
And she brought the executive chef
from Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles,

04:18.091 --> 04:19.259
Liz Hong, who I love.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.052
I come every year, once a year.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.554
-[Massimo] My first time was '88.
-Yes!

04:24.097 --> 04:25.974
-[Phil] Mine was maybe the same.
-Eighty-eight.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.351
But the top of my head came off.

04:28.434 --> 04:31.229
You know, I never had great steak before.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.691
I still remember the lamb. So tasty.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.276
-[Nancy] They've got great--
-Really?

04:36.359 --> 04:37.527
[Nancy] Did you order lamb?

04:37.610 --> 04:40.405
-No. But we can. We're not dead yet.
-[Nancy] Yeah, we should try it.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.864
[Phil] We starting off small.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.367
Just a little bacon
and some cheeseburgers.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.160
-[Nancy] Oh, wow!
-[Massimo] Oh, my God.

04:46.661 --> 04:48.413
-[Phil] Here we go. Here we go.
-Come on.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.164
-[Phil] Oh, God.
-[Massimo] This is crazy.

04:51.207 --> 04:53.167
I'm gonna make a bacon cheeseburger.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.836
[Phil] Good idea!

04:56.170 --> 04:57.964
Good, right? Really good.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.758
[Phil] A great burger...
made with the steak trimmings.

05:00.967 --> 05:03.594
You know what I like? You see the bun?

05:04.178 --> 05:08.975
It's the perfect proportion
between the meat and the filling.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.102
-People don't get that anymore.
-No.

05:11.185 --> 05:13.688
-[Phil] It's so important!
-The proportion in food is everything.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.399
-Do you like the sauce? Nice, right?
-Mm-hmm.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.276
-[Phil] Gravy boat.
-[Massimo] Matches nicely.

05:18.359 --> 05:19.402
[Phil] Uh-huh.

05:19.485 --> 05:22.196
[Liz] It's like cocktail sauce
met steak sauce.

05:22.280 --> 05:23.614
-Yeah.
-[Liz] So good.

05:26.826 --> 05:29.579
[Phil] The Italian hand gesture
for what he thinks.

05:30.496 --> 05:31.706
[Phil chuckles]

05:31.789 --> 05:32.999
Here comes trouble.

05:33.082 --> 05:34.584
-[Liz] What's that?
-[Phil] Lamb chop!

05:34.667 --> 05:37.670
I've been coming here for 30 years,
I've never had the lamb.

05:41.883 --> 05:42.842
Whoa.

05:42.925 --> 05:46.137
Oh, my God. There's so much flavor.
And it's so tender.

05:46.220 --> 05:47.764
Best lamb ever!

05:47.847 --> 05:48.765
As you remember?

05:49.474 --> 05:50.433
[Phil giggles]

05:51.851 --> 05:54.020
This was never
a white tablecloth restaurant, right?

05:54.103 --> 05:55.688
-No.
-Always like this?

05:55.772 --> 05:57.774
It was a German beer hall.

05:57.857 --> 05:59.484
There was sawdust on the floor.

05:59.567 --> 06:01.736
-Oh, look, there's fish.
-Have anything to hide?

06:01.819 --> 06:03.196
Somebody's getting salmon.

06:03.571 --> 06:05.823
Somebody's crazy.
I'll bet the salmon's good.

06:05.907 --> 06:07.241
No, I don't think so.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.118
-Wanna ask for a taste?
-[Massimo] You want?

06:09.202 --> 06:10.953
-I would ask.
-[Phil] He's going to ask.

06:11.037 --> 06:11.996
-[Liz] For what?
-A bite.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.206
He's asking for a taste.

06:13.748 --> 06:17.085
-Excuse me. I'm a poor chef from Italy.
-[Phil and Nancy laugh]

06:17.168 --> 06:19.587
And I would love to have
a taste of that salmon.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.381
-Can I? Yeah?
-[woman] Yeah.

06:28.054 --> 06:31.516
-It's very good. Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

06:31.599 --> 06:32.433
[Phil laughs]

06:32.850 --> 06:34.310
-[Liz] Was it good?
-A bit overcooked.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.104
[all laugh]

06:36.854 --> 06:38.856
[Phil] Let's be honest.
The place isn't still around

06:38.940 --> 06:40.233
because they make salmon.

06:40.316 --> 06:42.819
[Phil] Look! That's it. That's the move.

06:42.902 --> 06:44.404
He turns the butter plate over.

06:44.904 --> 06:47.281
One of my favorite moves
in all of sports.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.951
-[Phil] Look! Look!
-[Massimo] Oh, my God!

06:50.034 --> 06:50.910
[Nancy] Wow.

06:50.993 --> 06:52.870
[Phil]
Look how all the butter and the juice

06:52.954 --> 06:55.873
pool up at one end for easy scooping.

06:55.957 --> 06:57.583
-[giggles]
-[Liz laughs]

06:58.126 --> 06:59.919
[Phil] Liz is zobblin' on that bone!

07:00.002 --> 07:02.004
-[Massimo] That's the best.
-[Nancy] That's the best.

07:02.922 --> 07:03.798
[Liz] That's so good.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.554
That's it! That makes me happy.

07:10.096 --> 07:10.930
You want some?

07:11.764 --> 07:16.644
This is-- This is the Peter Luger version
of breaking bread together.

07:17.061 --> 07:18.563
That means you need a bite too, Phil.

07:19.981 --> 07:20.898
Right? It just...

07:21.858 --> 07:27.697
This is one of my favorite...
dining experiences in the world.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.449
Can we get lamb for them?

07:29.532 --> 07:30.575
[Nancy laughs]

07:30.658 --> 07:33.578
[Phil] You have to get everything.
I love the hash browns.

07:33.661 --> 07:34.495
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

07:34.579 --> 07:36.664
I love-- The french fries are incredible.

07:36.747 --> 07:38.374
I love the desserts. Look at this.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.044
Ice cream sundae. Look at the schlag.
Mountains of schlag.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.963
-[Liz] Wait, what's that?
-[Phil] Whipped cream.

07:44.046 --> 07:45.131
-Whipped cream.
-For what?

07:45.214 --> 07:47.800
For your chocolate
and your thing and thing and thing.

07:47.884 --> 07:51.429
Cheesecake: best.
Chocolate-mousse cake: best.

07:51.512 --> 07:53.306
Hot pecan pie.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.600
You know what goes good on that? Schlag!

07:56.142 --> 07:58.102
-[Liz] Look it! Bah!
-[Massimo] Oh.

07:59.270 --> 08:00.855
It's so good.

08:08.362 --> 08:11.032
[Phil] Twenty-five years ago
when I moved from New York to L.A.,

08:11.199 --> 08:12.950
I had to leave behind my true love.

08:13.034 --> 08:16.120
["Amore Piu Bello" playing]

08:16.204 --> 08:17.538
[Phil] New York pizza.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.304
Which is not to say you can't get
great pizza in L.A.,

08:33.387 --> 08:35.348
but there's nothing like the original.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.934
And I'm here to show you some of the best.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.728
We're going on a pizza crawl.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.272
We're going to hit two classics
and a new upstart.

08:43.814 --> 08:46.442
Number one: Totonno's
in Coney Island, Brooklyn.

08:46.901 --> 08:50.446
This is one of these places
where the romance meets the reality.

08:50.988 --> 08:53.741
Ed Levine wrote the book on pizza.
Literally.

08:53.824 --> 08:56.911
And then the book became a website
and that became Serious Eats.

08:56.994 --> 08:57.995
[Phil] What's on there?

08:58.329 --> 09:00.498
-[Ed] Sausage and mushrooms.
-[Phil] Yes, it is!

09:00.581 --> 09:03.626
Oh! A white pie. I'm excited.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.795
Pizza is first and foremost great bread.

09:05.878 --> 09:08.297
-You're right.
-Right? So I always take a piece--

09:08.381 --> 09:11.384
-I tear a piece off the crust...
-Right. To test it.

09:11.467 --> 09:14.887
To test it because... And it's perfect.

09:14.971 --> 09:16.180
That's great on its own.

09:18.099 --> 09:18.933
Mm.

09:19.475 --> 09:24.438
This place was opened by a guy
whose nickname was Totonno.

09:24.522 --> 09:27.191
His real name was Anthony Pero.

09:27.275 --> 09:30.111
When this was
a middle-class Italian neighborhood,

09:30.194 --> 09:32.238
it stayed in the same family

09:32.321 --> 09:35.116
for almost a hundred years now.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.243
-No changes.
-[Phil] What d'you mean?

09:37.326 --> 09:39.787
-They have current headlines.
-Exactly. [laughs]

09:40.788 --> 09:42.540
[Phil] They also have the sisters.

09:42.623 --> 09:46.002
Excuse me. You were in Positano
with my plumber who's on the phone.

09:46.085 --> 09:48.379
-I was in Positano with your plumber?
-Yes.

09:48.462 --> 09:50.965
-He remembers seeing me in Positano?
-Of course he saw you!

09:51.048 --> 09:53.593
-Here. Say hello to Al.
-Hello, I remember you from Positano!

09:53.676 --> 09:54.510
You were the plumber.

09:54.594 --> 09:55.469
[chuckles]

09:55.553 --> 09:57.597
[Phil] Antoinette and Cookie
run the place now.

09:58.514 --> 10:01.225
They're Totonno's granddaughters,
and they're always up for a party.

10:03.019 --> 10:04.854
Yes! Oh, my God!

10:04.937 --> 10:06.063
[all laughing]

10:06.647 --> 10:08.566
Cookie, come over here
'cause I'm gonna leave.

10:08.649 --> 10:09.817
[Phil] She doesn't want to.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.445
Come here before I hit you
with this bottle in 2 seconds. [laughs]

10:12.528 --> 10:14.071
Cookie's very shy.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.907
It's not that I'm shy. Let her talk.
She likes to talk.

10:16.991 --> 10:18.117
[laughs]

10:18.200 --> 10:19.702
Nobody messes with Cookie.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.662
If anybody bothers me,
I just throw them out.

10:21.746 --> 10:23.581
-[Ed] Exactly!
-[Phil] That's good.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.709
The answer to...
"What do you like about New York?"

10:26.792 --> 10:27.877
[all laugh]

10:28.794 --> 10:31.922
[Antoinette] Our grandfather,
he brought pizza to America.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.342
In 1905, when he came from Italy on the--

10:34.425 --> 10:36.552
I think it was The Margherita,
was the name of the boat.

10:36.636 --> 10:37.470
[laughs]

10:37.553 --> 10:40.014
The Margherita and the pizza.
Isn't that something?

10:40.097 --> 10:41.891
My family came over on The Rugelach.

10:41.974 --> 10:43.267
[laughs]

10:43.934 --> 10:46.562
[Phil] They got a photograph on the wall.
It's got "Lombardi's,"

10:46.646 --> 10:51.067
which is widely considered
the birthplace of American pizza.

10:51.150 --> 10:54.403
On the right is the owner, Mr. Lombardi.

10:54.487 --> 10:58.616
But next to him is the pizzaiolo,
the man who made the pizza,

10:59.200 --> 11:01.410
Anthony "Totonno" Pero.

11:02.036 --> 11:05.831
He's the one with flour on his shoes.

11:06.582 --> 11:09.126
That, to Cookie and Antoinette,
is the proof!

11:09.210 --> 11:11.253
There'd be no pizza
if it weren't for Anthony Pero.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.172
-To Anthony Pero!
-To Anthony Pero!

11:13.255 --> 11:14.548
[Antoinette] That is right.

11:14.632 --> 11:17.885
When you're good at something,
it's in your blood, it's in your family,

11:17.968 --> 11:20.763
you fight hard, you keep it,
you make it great.

11:20.846 --> 11:23.182
-Salute, health is right.
-Health only. Nothing else.

11:23.265 --> 11:24.600
What do we say in Jewish?

11:24.684 --> 11:26.477
-How do we say it?
-How do we say it in Jewish?

11:26.560 --> 11:27.645
-L'chaim.
-L'chaim.

11:27.728 --> 11:30.564
[Phil] In our language, the more "ugh"
you have the better.

11:30.648 --> 11:31.857
[all laugh]

11:33.984 --> 11:37.154
[Phil] Next, another legendary spot
for pizza in New York.

11:37.863 --> 11:40.533
It's off the Avenue J stop
in Midwood, Brooklyn.

11:41.534 --> 11:42.576
Di Fara's.

11:43.119 --> 11:44.120
-It's a long wait?
-Yes.

11:44.203 --> 11:47.540
He said it's an hour-and-a-half wait
after you order your pizza.

11:47.623 --> 11:48.624
[Phil] No, it's not.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.875
[woman] That's what he says.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.712
[Phil] There's just one guy making it.

11:53.838 --> 11:58.592
He's been doing it for longer
than most of you have been alive.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.178
[Phil] Wait a minute.
Why do we put up with this?

12:01.262 --> 12:03.305
Sometimes you just got to have the best.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.559
[Phil] Dom, whose last name is DeMarco,

12:07.017 --> 12:10.062
and his partner,
whose last name was Farina...

12:10.146 --> 12:12.022
Two names.
"What will we call the store?"

12:12.106 --> 12:15.735
They put the Di for DeMarco
and Fara for Farina

12:16.026 --> 12:17.737
and it became Di Fara's.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.364
But Dom is still here. The partner is not.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.075
[Phil] Oh.

12:23.159 --> 12:24.618
-That looks...
-[Ed] Take a look.

12:24.702 --> 12:25.995
[Phil] Wow, is that beautiful.

12:26.537 --> 12:28.998
-Look at what he's doing. Hands.
-[Phil] Look, bare hands.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.875
That's like the legend, right?

12:30.958 --> 12:33.502
"I hear he pulls them
out of the oven with his bare hands."

12:33.586 --> 12:34.462
[Ed chuckles] True.

12:34.545 --> 12:35.963
-[Phil] He's Iron Man.
-[Ed] Yeah.

12:36.046 --> 12:37.298
[Phil] You see? Wow.

12:38.549 --> 12:40.801
I'm happy you're still here.
You're still doing it.

12:40.885 --> 12:43.387
-I do what I like, you know.
-[Ed] You do what you love.

12:43.471 --> 12:46.599
You do what you love: make the pizza.
I do what I love: eat the pizza.

12:46.682 --> 12:47.850
[chuckles]

12:47.933 --> 12:52.980
[Phil] We just got the basic pie,
but it's got the fresh cut basil on top.

12:53.063 --> 12:53.898
[Ed] Exactly.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.650
People were not snipping basil
on slices.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.862
-And he's been doing it here...
-[Phil] Yes.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.822
-...for more than 50 years.
-Right.

13:04.492 --> 13:05.868
[Phil] Wow, it's good.

13:06.660 --> 13:08.829
-Dom, you still got it.
-I hope so.

13:09.205 --> 13:10.247
I know so.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.751
[woman] Is Julia here? Julia?

13:13.834 --> 13:16.003
Julia, where are you?
We're gonna eat your pizza!

13:16.587 --> 13:19.256
-I'll bet people have bought pies...
-[Ed] It's a secondary market.

13:19.340 --> 13:22.635
...and they go right outside
and sell it like Springsteen tickets.

13:25.304 --> 13:29.099
[Phil] Is this some of the best pizza
I've ever tasted?

13:30.392 --> 13:32.853
Yes. It's undeniable.

13:33.979 --> 13:35.231
-[Phil] Dom.
-[Dom] Yeah.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.608
[Phil] We love you. We love your pizza.

13:38.108 --> 13:39.485
Eighty more years to you.

13:39.568 --> 13:41.320
I'm not gonna stop. [chuckles]

13:41.403 --> 13:43.447
[Phil] Don't worry, Dom. Neither will we.

13:46.617 --> 13:49.578
One of the best things about New York
are the New Yorkers.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.997
-Do you eat over here?
-It's all right.

13:52.373 --> 13:53.874
-It's not the greatest.
-What?

13:53.958 --> 13:55.376
-Not the greatest.
-Who's better?

13:55.459 --> 13:59.547
I like the pizza joint over there
by Madison Square Garden. Pizza Suprema.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.924
-I like it too. Very good.
-Know what?

14:02.007 --> 14:04.969
-He's got taste. He's a man with taste.
-We'll let you live. You got taste.

14:05.052 --> 14:06.512
I make my own pizza.

14:06.595 --> 14:07.888
-Yeah!
-All right!

14:08.681 --> 14:10.850
In New York, you never hear, "I think."

14:11.642 --> 14:13.811
-No, no, no.
-They just say, "That's not the best."

14:13.894 --> 14:15.604
[laughs] That's true.

14:16.355 --> 14:17.731
[Phil] These pizzas are classics,

14:17.815 --> 14:21.151
but Ed said I can't leave
without trying his new champion.

14:21.485 --> 14:25.406
And then he tells me that the best pizza
in New York is in New Jersey.

14:25.489 --> 14:28.033
Here it is. This is Razza.

14:28.534 --> 14:30.870
Jersey City. It counts as New York.

14:31.161 --> 14:33.956
If you can get somewhere within
half an hour of the center of town--

14:34.039 --> 14:35.416
-Know your argument?
-[Phil] Yes?

14:35.499 --> 14:37.334
The Giants and the Jets play in Jersey.

14:37.418 --> 14:38.544
Hey, very good.

14:38.627 --> 14:41.213
Joining us at Razza is Dom Lombardozzi.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.425
Maybe you saw him on The Wire
or Boardwalk Empire.

14:44.508 --> 14:48.095
He is a phenomenal actor,
and he's a foodie like me.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.347
[Phil] Oh!

14:51.056 --> 14:53.934
[Phil] The pizza's made
by Razza's owner, genius Dan Richer.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.896
He's self-taught
and kind of obsessed with details.

14:57.229 --> 15:00.566
I tasted 13 different pepperonis
when I was developing this.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.110
I love you.
You're like a mad scientist behind there.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.361
[Phil] But it's what you want

15:04.445 --> 15:06.071
in a guy making you something.

15:06.155 --> 15:07.656
I want an obsessive character.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.076
Wow.

15:11.160 --> 15:12.161
-Damn!
-[Dom] Right?

15:12.703 --> 15:14.246
[Phil] Best pepperoni pizza I ever had.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.999
[Ed] It's phenomenal.
It makes you excited about pizza again.

15:17.625 --> 15:21.420
I can't hear you
because in my head it is this...

15:21.503 --> 15:24.340
♪ Ah ♪

15:24.423 --> 15:26.216
["Ave Maria" playing]

15:27.968 --> 15:29.845
[Phil] Dan started us out with a classic,

15:29.929 --> 15:32.348
but now we're moving on
to what he's famous for:

15:32.431 --> 15:35.225
completely original combinations.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.061
[Dan] This is one of our seasonal pies.

15:37.353 --> 15:39.647
It's New Jersey corn, shaved onions,

15:39.730 --> 15:41.815
fresh mozzarella and scamorza cheese.

15:43.442 --> 15:44.276
Wow.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.319
Oh, my God.

15:45.402 --> 15:47.655
Right.
This is change-your-life good pizza.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.950
[Dom] I'm a purist.
I love the Margherita pizza.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.077
-This?
-Amazing.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.453
-This is amazing.
-Yeah.

15:54.536 --> 15:55.371
-[Ed] Wow.
-Thanks.

15:55.454 --> 15:56.747
This is so enjoyable.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.166
-[Dan] This is the pork pie.
-[Phil] Yes!

15:59.708 --> 16:03.629
[Dan] We take pork gelatin and cut it into
cubes and then it enables us to put the--

16:03.712 --> 16:06.757
So it's almost like you're putting
soup dumpling filling on the pizza.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.592
So this was inspired by the soup dumpling.

16:09.468 --> 16:13.097
[Ed] Look at that. Look at his face
light up. Like a Hanukkah bush.

16:14.014 --> 16:14.848
Like a what?

16:17.101 --> 16:19.937
This is not just about the pizza.
It's about this guy's head.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.356
Dan. Dan. Dan. Dan.

16:22.439 --> 16:25.317
[Dom] Look at these guys
after 20 slices of pizza.

16:25.401 --> 16:26.610
[Dan] My man can throw down.

16:26.777 --> 16:27.987
-[Dom] Twenty-one!
-[Dan] See!

16:28.070 --> 16:29.071
[Ed] Twenty-one!

16:29.154 --> 16:31.448
Are there any more pizzas back there
that I didn't have?

16:32.533 --> 16:35.452
[Dan] We have a rotation
of about 60 pies that we do.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.870
[Ed and Dan chuckle]

16:36.954 --> 16:39.289
I don't think we had 60 pies, do you?

16:39.373 --> 16:40.624
[Dan chuckles]

16:46.005 --> 16:48.882
[Phil] There's a food that made
New York famous before pizza.

16:49.133 --> 16:52.261
And a great place to get it
is in the middle of the harbor

16:52.344 --> 16:53.846
on a boat called "Pilot."

16:54.221 --> 16:57.808
And I'm meeting
a very good friend of mine named Al Roker.

16:57.933 --> 16:59.101
Maybe you've heard of him.

16:59.643 --> 17:01.603
And our friend John Harris.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.897
I wanted to do this with Al
because he's Mr. New York.

17:03.981 --> 17:06.734
He is part of the reason this city
is so nice they named it twice.

17:06.817 --> 17:11.030
How many years now? In New--
Forget The Today Show. Just in New York.

17:11.113 --> 17:13.073
In New York since 1983.

17:13.157 --> 17:15.075
-[Phil] So you're a New Yorker.
-I'm a New Yorker.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.912
[Phil] So the company's great, but I
forgot, when I was getting on the boat,

17:18.996 --> 17:20.581
that it would be going like this a bit.

17:21.582 --> 17:23.208
I wish you guys would stop moving.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.252
Are you a little shaky right now?

17:25.335 --> 17:26.378
A little bit.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.921
-I'm OK.
-[Phil] Here's to your face.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.506
-[Al] Hey, now.
-Here's to your face.

17:29.590 --> 17:30.758
[John] Here's to your face.

17:30.841 --> 17:32.676
-Here's to your stomach.
-Love seeing you.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.720
-This helps-- Bitters and soda.
-[John] Bitters.

17:34.803 --> 17:36.013
-Yes.
-[Phil and Al] Who knew?

17:36.096 --> 17:37.514
-[chuckles]
-Who knew?

17:37.598 --> 17:39.808
[Phil] But we're not just here
to watch me turn green.

17:39.975 --> 17:43.020
We're here to taste a bit
of New York City's history: oysters.

17:43.395 --> 17:47.441
And we're joined by chef Kerry Heffernan
and oyster expert Julie Qiu.

17:47.816 --> 17:51.195
So when the first settlers came here
and explored this area,

17:51.779 --> 17:55.532
they reported back to Europe that they
found oysters the size of dinner plates.

17:55.616 --> 17:58.744
And a lot of people came here
to experience the New York oyster

17:58.827 --> 18:00.496
because it was that big of a deal.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.707
It was called, New York... The Big Oyster!

18:03.791 --> 18:04.875
[Al] The Big Oyster?

18:04.958 --> 18:06.543
Before the Big Apple,
it was called that.

18:06.627 --> 18:07.878
I think it's a better title.

18:08.796 --> 18:11.090
[Phil] Back when you could eat
oysters from these waters,

18:11.173 --> 18:13.425
they were sold
from street carts like hot dogs.

18:13.634 --> 18:15.636
And they only cost five cents an oyster.

18:16.136 --> 18:17.596
They're a little more expensive now.

18:18.514 --> 18:19.515
[John] Cheers.

18:19.598 --> 18:22.101
And so you guys know
how to eat an oyster properly?

18:22.184 --> 18:23.227
-[John] No.
-[Phil] Let me.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.895
-[Julie] OK.
-[Phil] Tell me if I'm right.

18:24.978 --> 18:25.813
Yeah, okay.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.815
[laughs]

18:28.357 --> 18:30.901
[Julie] You want to sip that liquor.
You want to savor that.

18:30.984 --> 18:32.694
Slurp it down. Chew it.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.280
A lot of people don't chew that meat.
It drives me nuts.

18:35.364 --> 18:36.448
It actually allows--

18:36.532 --> 18:38.826
-It releases the sweetness of the oyster.
-[Al] Terrific.

18:39.409 --> 18:43.539
Why are some oysters briny
and some are literally sweet?

18:43.622 --> 18:46.250
[Julie] When they're
next to more fresh water,

18:46.333 --> 18:49.002
they're going to be
a little more sweet and less saline.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.296
But when they're grown,
like, very close to the ocean,

18:51.380 --> 18:52.798
that's when they're super briny.

18:52.881 --> 18:54.633
-It's like eating the ocean.
-[Julie] Exactly.

18:54.716 --> 18:58.220
-High tidal flushes are giving that--
-I had one of those last night.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.389
[all laugh]

19:04.143 --> 19:05.018
Yes!

19:05.102 --> 19:07.896
-[John] Ooh. Oh, my God.
-Yay! Oysters!

19:07.980 --> 19:09.439
-[Al] Yay!
-[John] The best I've had.

19:09.523 --> 19:11.859
How about in New Orleans
where they grill them?

19:11.942 --> 19:14.194
-It's good. Have you ever had that?
-Chargrilled oysters.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.155
I've never had that before.
Is it delicious?

19:16.238 --> 19:18.031
-When we go to New Orleans.
-Next stop.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.950
I think we're
just going to travel with Phil.

19:20.033 --> 19:21.160
Unmoor this.

19:22.077 --> 19:22.995
[Phil] Here we go.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.710
[Phil] New York is
the very definition of city.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.753
Bustling, loud, non-stop

19:31.837 --> 19:34.798
with buildings stacked
on top of each other into the distance.

19:34.882 --> 19:35.716
It's exhilarating.

19:36.425 --> 19:39.845
But some of my favorite places
have the opposite effect.

19:42.514 --> 19:46.101
New York City has
some of the best parks in the world.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.020
This is the High Line.

19:48.103 --> 19:51.857
Running for a mile and a half
along a reclaimed elevated rail line,

19:51.940 --> 19:54.193
is a wonder and a marvel
of urban planning.

19:55.903 --> 19:57.779
Then at the northern tip of Manhattan,

19:57.905 --> 20:01.658
near where I had my first apartment
after college, is Fort Tryon Park...

20:02.326 --> 20:04.036
with its beautiful views
of the Hudson River

20:04.119 --> 20:05.829
and the cliffs of New Jersey.

20:06.955 --> 20:11.126
John D. Rockefeller built the park
and he bought the view.

20:11.668 --> 20:15.464
He bought the entire Jersey side
of the Hudson River

20:15.631 --> 20:18.926
so that no one could build on it and it
would be forever preserved like this.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.302
That's money!

20:21.762 --> 20:23.972
Each of these places is spectacular.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.976
But they still can't hold a candle
to the park to end all parks.

20:28.560 --> 20:30.354
My favorite park in the world
is Central Park.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.605
Maybe my favorite place ever.

20:34.483 --> 20:35.943
And it's in the middle of the city.

20:38.362 --> 20:41.990
My wife, Monica, and I spent
a lot of time here when we were dating.

20:42.491 --> 20:44.826
And we still come back here
every time we're in town.

20:46.912 --> 20:47.746
Here's what I love.

20:47.829 --> 20:50.290
You're on this bridge
and if you look here,

20:50.374 --> 20:53.627
you're completely lost in the woods,
you're in nature, it's gorgeous.

20:53.877 --> 20:55.295
And you look here...

20:56.672 --> 20:57.506
you're in the city.

20:58.215 --> 21:00.717
[Phil] A lot of people just think
that there was wildlife here

21:00.801 --> 21:04.972
and the city built up around it
and just left that park alone. No.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.683
Every single thing has been designed.

21:07.766 --> 21:08.600
Everything.

21:09.768 --> 21:13.146
It's cinematic. Everywhere you look
is a perfectly composed vista.

21:15.023 --> 21:18.068
It's so beautiful and you walk through it

21:18.151 --> 21:20.404
and you're transported out of the city.

21:21.655 --> 21:23.073
[Monica] It's beautiful, huh?

21:23.782 --> 21:25.409
[Phil] That reminds me
I want duck tonight.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.743
Oh, Philip.

21:27.744 --> 21:30.372
[Phil] Steve Cohen's been
a Central Park tour guide for years,

21:30.455 --> 21:32.207
and he knows everything about everything.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.543
-[Phil] This--
-[Steve] All is man-made.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.169
Think of the labor.

21:36.253 --> 21:38.880
-[Phil] For recreational sake.
-[Steve] That's right.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.799
-To get rid of the chaos.
-[Phil] Right.

21:40.882 --> 21:42.134
[Steve] To lose yourself.

21:42.217 --> 21:45.178
-I love getting lost in the city.
-Well, that's the intention.

21:45.262 --> 21:48.890
Imagine the most prime real estate
on the face of the Earth

21:48.974 --> 21:52.185
left alone for the people.

21:52.728 --> 21:55.188
And as full of attractions
as any museum.

21:55.272 --> 21:57.566
Like these 19th century sandstone reliefs,

21:57.649 --> 22:00.277
considered the first public art
in the country.

22:01.320 --> 22:03.447
And Bethesda Fountain's iconic angel,

22:03.739 --> 22:05.615
created by sculptor Emma Stebbins

22:05.699 --> 22:07.492
to celebrate
the city's clean drinking water.

22:08.493 --> 22:09.911
[Phil] So now we're in the woods.

22:09.995 --> 22:11.204
[Steve] We are in the Ramble.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.081
[Monica] Philip, come on.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.542
-We're frolicking in Central Park.
-[Phil] Oh, my God.

22:15.625 --> 22:17.586
[Steve] And look up.
Look at the engineering.

22:17.669 --> 22:19.296
[Monica] Look at the romance.

22:19.379 --> 22:21.923
-I'm looking at the engineering.
-[Monica] We're frolicking!

22:22.007 --> 22:26.636
It's a beautiful ideal...
ideally realized.

22:27.471 --> 22:29.056
[Phil] It is romantic, I have to say.

22:29.139 --> 22:30.349
[Monica] Yeah, it is.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.143
[Steve] Oh. Lovely meeting you.

22:33.226 --> 22:34.061
[Monica] I've had it.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.020
[Steve chuckles]

22:50.327 --> 22:51.244
Oh, marriage.

22:51.328 --> 22:52.704
[man] You've got to kiss her! Go!

22:52.788 --> 22:54.081
Yeah, right?

22:54.164 --> 22:57.501
-[man] Come on! You're in New York!
-[Monica] Philip.

22:57.584 --> 22:59.711
[cheering and applause]

22:59.878 --> 23:01.296
[man] All right! Terrific!

23:01.838 --> 23:02.714
He's a good actor.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.549
[all laugh]

23:07.969 --> 23:09.805
[Phil] After you ramble
through the Ramble,

23:09.888 --> 23:12.599
you got to go just west of the park
to the Upper West Side.

23:12.682 --> 23:15.102
And one of my new favorite places in town.

23:15.685 --> 23:18.271
Especially popular with carnivorous types.

23:18.814 --> 23:20.440
Oh, geez. Do you need help?

23:20.524 --> 23:22.567
-[Jocelyn] No, I got this.
-That's bigger than you.

23:22.651 --> 23:24.444
-[Jocelyn chuckles]
-[Phil] I'm very impressed.

23:24.945 --> 23:27.614
That's actually what I was going
to have. I was gonna order that.

23:27.697 --> 23:28.657
On a roll.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.535
[Phil] Erika and Jocelyn
are world-class butchers

23:31.618 --> 23:33.787
and they run their shop called White Gold.

23:33.870 --> 23:35.956
How much does that weigh,
what you were just carrying?

23:36.039 --> 23:37.791
Like a hundred pounds. One-fifty, maybe.

23:37.874 --> 23:39.251
-That's nothing.
-[Jocelyn] Yeah.

23:39.334 --> 23:40.377
[laughs]

23:40.460 --> 23:43.422
-[Phil] You were a vegetarian?
-Growing up, you know.

23:43.505 --> 23:45.507
And what turned you? The sight of this?

23:45.590 --> 23:47.426
It's funny.
I was an animal rights vegetarian.

23:47.509 --> 23:50.053
Now I consider myself,
like, an animal rights butcher.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.640
-[Judy] Hi, guys.
-Oh! It's Judy!

23:53.723 --> 23:55.225
-Hi!
-[Phil] Judy Gold, White Gold.

23:55.308 --> 23:57.227
-White Gold was your rap name, wasn't it?
-Yeah.

23:57.310 --> 23:59.438
[Phil] My friend Judy Gold
is a great comedian

23:59.521 --> 24:01.231
who actually lives in the neighborhood,

24:01.314 --> 24:04.192
so I'm excited to introduce her
to this palace of meat.

24:04.276 --> 24:05.193
So, I'm vegan.

24:05.277 --> 24:07.195
[laughs]

24:08.238 --> 24:09.656
[Judy] Oh, God. Look at that meat.

24:09.739 --> 24:11.408
Oh!

24:11.491 --> 24:14.161
[Phil] So, here's why White Gold
is the best butcher shop ever...

24:14.244 --> 24:17.747
They also serve idealized versions

24:17.831 --> 24:21.460
of the classic New York food
you'd find at the corner deli.

24:22.002 --> 24:23.962
[Phil] Bacon, egg and cheese.

24:24.045 --> 24:27.799
This was my staple diet in the '80s.

24:27.883 --> 24:29.551
-It's unbelievable.
-[Jocelyn] Good.

24:29.843 --> 24:32.637
Beef pastrami Reuben
with house-made kraut,

24:32.721 --> 24:34.264
house-made Thousand Island.

24:34.347 --> 24:36.516
[Judy] Oh, my God.
Can we just look at the layers here?

24:37.517 --> 24:38.810
I mean, that's perfect.

24:39.394 --> 24:40.270
Oh, my God.

24:40.353 --> 24:42.314
Oh, my God. No. This is--

24:45.525 --> 24:48.487
[Phil] Homemade hot dogs
with kimchi sauerkraut.

24:48.904 --> 24:51.573
Roast beef
with something called beef butter.

24:51.656 --> 24:52.991
-Oh!
-[Jocelyn] That's fresh?

24:53.658 --> 24:56.912
[Phil] And an upscale take on
a local sandwich I didn't even know about.

24:57.245 --> 24:59.873
[Phil] Who wants
to look at the chopped cheese?

24:59.956 --> 25:03.752
[Erika] You throw, you know,
the pickles and the jalapenos on it

25:04.252 --> 25:06.171
and then you chop.

25:06.671 --> 25:09.216
And then the cheese goes on it.
You let it melt a little bit

25:09.299 --> 25:10.133
and onto the bun.

25:10.217 --> 25:11.510
[Phil] It's a cheeseburger.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.428
-Mm.
-[Jocelyn] Yeah.

25:13.970 --> 25:14.846
[Judy] Who thought it?

25:15.222 --> 25:17.432
[Phil] Chopping the meat
and the cheese together.

25:17.516 --> 25:20.018
Yeah, it's like
a classic Harlem bodega sandwich.

25:20.101 --> 25:21.102
-[Phil] Didn't know.
-Yes.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.276
[chuckles]

25:28.360 --> 25:29.194
Mm!

25:29.277 --> 25:30.946
You're doing God's work here.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.199
Thanks, girl.

25:34.282 --> 25:36.535
[Judy] I am in this area all the time.

25:36.618 --> 25:40.330
And I will never walk by here
and not come in.

25:40.413 --> 25:42.541
That sounds like a threat when you say it.

25:42.624 --> 25:44.125
[all laugh]

25:46.836 --> 25:49.589
[Phil] Full of meat now, Judy and I
will have the energy we need

25:49.673 --> 25:52.384
to attack
the most important store in the world.

25:53.343 --> 25:54.594
The deli of delis.

25:54.678 --> 25:56.221
The super deli. The uber deli.

25:56.304 --> 25:57.514
Zabar's.

25:57.597 --> 26:02.644
It is the be all and end all to
everyone's life in that part of the world.

26:02.727 --> 26:06.189
This is a little something
I like to call "two Jews run amok."

26:06.273 --> 26:09.234
[Judy] Oh, the German Swiss
is actually very good.

26:09.651 --> 26:12.946
Now that they've-- You know,
they're sorry, I get the German Swiss.

26:13.488 --> 26:18.076
You'd think the pre-made bagel
with cream cheese would not be as good.

26:18.660 --> 26:20.078
-[Phil] Thank you.
-[Judy] Sure.

26:25.250 --> 26:29.379
[Judy] Mm. Mm. Mm.

26:29.462 --> 26:30.630
Oh, my God! It's so good!

26:30.714 --> 26:33.550
Hello. We're just dancing.

26:34.718 --> 26:35.635
[Judy] Look at this.

26:35.719 --> 26:37.220
[Phil] Oh!

26:37.304 --> 26:39.931
[loudly] Can I have half pound sliced
thin?

26:40.515 --> 26:41.808
-I'm trying to fit in.
-Louder.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.226
Sliced thin.

26:43.310 --> 26:45.353
[loudly] Can I have it sliced-- Thinner!

26:45.437 --> 26:46.563
-Thinner!
-Is that the best?

26:46.646 --> 26:47.564
[yells] Thinner!

26:47.897 --> 26:49.232
[Phil] I used to manage a deli.

26:49.357 --> 26:51.526
-You did? Were you good?
-They would come and they'd say,

26:51.610 --> 26:53.111
"Is this what you have?"

26:53.903 --> 26:55.322
[laughs]

26:55.405 --> 26:56.615
-Yes.
-No.

26:56.698 --> 26:58.158
This is what we have. Yes.

26:58.241 --> 27:00.243
That's why you're seeing it,
because we have it.

27:00.493 --> 27:04.539
And they would say,
"No, no. Is there more in the back?"

27:04.623 --> 27:06.708
-Yeah, we're hiding it from you.
-No, we have it.

27:06.791 --> 27:09.044
We do have more in the back, but--
"Yeah, is it better?"

27:09.127 --> 27:11.004
[laughs]

27:11.087 --> 27:13.048
"Yeah, but it's me. It's me.
You can tell me.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.091
Tell me if it's better..." [mumbles]

27:15.175 --> 27:16.635
[laughs]

27:17.385 --> 27:20.013
-[Judy] This is the secret tunnel.
-[Phil] I love a secret tunnel.

27:20.096 --> 27:23.433
Now this opens you up
into a whole new world.

27:23.516 --> 27:25.894
-♪ It's a whole new world-- ♪
-We can't afford that.

27:25.977 --> 27:26.811
Oh.

27:28.521 --> 27:29.939
And what do you get when you come?

27:30.315 --> 27:32.692
Usually things to eat, snack on. And...

27:32.942 --> 27:34.486
-Things to eat. Good idea.
-What you get?

27:34.569 --> 27:36.154
-Getting things to eat.
-What you get?

27:36.363 --> 27:38.907
I got some-- What you call it? Ru--

27:38.990 --> 27:42.327
-Rugelach. Say it right.
-Rugelach. Isn't it the best? Say it.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.537
-What did you think it was? Rude-a-gus?
-Rude-a-gus.

27:44.829 --> 27:46.414
-Say rugelach.
-Rugelach.

27:46.498 --> 27:49.459
-With a "ugh" at the end. Ugh.
-Rugelach.

27:49.542 --> 27:50.669
-Rugelach.
-[Judy] Okay.

27:51.544 --> 27:52.545
Do you come here a lot?

27:53.088 --> 27:54.464
Do I come here a lot? No.

27:54.798 --> 27:55.799
-Why?
-Why not?

27:55.882 --> 27:57.550
I buy kosher, I'm kosher.

27:58.802 --> 27:59.928
You know there's ham in that.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.222
[both chuckle]

28:02.931 --> 28:03.973
[Phil] Is that all?

28:04.474 --> 28:05.767
We're buying that for you today.

28:06.017 --> 28:07.143
-No.
-Yes! Absolutely.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.561
Yes! Suzanne!

28:08.645 --> 28:09.479
-Yes.
-Why?

28:09.562 --> 28:10.897
-We have to give!
-You're on TV.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.857
-I wouldn't accept. Thank you.
-[Phil] Okay.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.652
[Judy] Bye, Suzanne. Shabbat shalom.

28:15.735 --> 28:16.945
You don't like this?

28:17.696 --> 28:19.280
-This is the 100 percent--
-Oh, that is--

28:19.364 --> 28:22.784
-Because you have to have.
-You bet. That's in every Jewish house.

28:22.867 --> 28:24.494
-Are you going to make egg creams?
-Yeah.

28:24.619 --> 28:25.453
Yeah, why not?

28:25.537 --> 28:28.331
-If you get this during Passover...
-Yes.

28:28.415 --> 28:29.999
...it doesn't have corn syrup in it.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.376
-That's not kosher.
-It's better?

28:31.459 --> 28:32.585
Yes, because it's corn.

28:32.669 --> 28:35.380
-Thing is, it's better without corn syrup.
-[Judy] It is?

28:35.463 --> 28:37.006
-[woman] Yes.
-I learned something today.

28:37.090 --> 28:38.299
That's interesting.

28:38.383 --> 28:41.970
[Phil] Yes, it's very interesting.
We also found out it's not true.

28:43.263 --> 28:45.098
-[Phil] Okay. It was fun.
-[Judy] It was good.

28:45.181 --> 28:47.100
-For playing with us today...
-Yeah?

28:47.350 --> 28:49.018
-...all this is yours.
-No way!

28:49.102 --> 28:49.936
Yep.

28:50.353 --> 28:51.771
Can I do another episode?

28:51.855 --> 28:52.689
Nope!

28:53.648 --> 28:55.442
[Phil] Don't be
selling this on the street.

28:57.652 --> 28:59.070
[Phil] That's old New York.

29:00.071 --> 29:01.740
So how about some new New York?

29:03.032 --> 29:06.661
A perfect place to see
the city's rising stars is Chefs Club.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.875
It's kind of a performance space
for chefs.

29:12.584 --> 29:14.753
With a new one taking over
every few months.

29:15.420 --> 29:17.380
Tonight I'm coming for JJ Johnson.

29:18.298 --> 29:20.633
At his last post, Harlem's The Cecil,

29:20.717 --> 29:23.094
JJ earned a James Beard award nomination

29:23.178 --> 29:25.472
for his elevation of Pan-African cuisine.

29:26.306 --> 29:28.600
It's his personal home-style comfort food

29:28.683 --> 29:30.560
served in a hip, downtown setting.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.188
How hungry are you?

29:33.271 --> 29:34.397
I'll taste everything.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.483
[JJ] Okay. I got some goat noodles.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.736
[Phil] I love goat.
I think goat is the most underrated meat.

29:40.028 --> 29:41.905
[JJ] It's the most consumed animal
in the world.

29:41.988 --> 29:43.907
But here, people don't know.

29:43.990 --> 29:45.700
They don't know what they're missing.

29:45.825 --> 29:49.120
[JJ] So this is based off a dish
coming from Brazil

29:49.204 --> 29:52.332
that has high Japanese culture
and West African culture

29:52.415 --> 29:53.666
living together on the coast.

29:54.209 --> 29:55.960
So it's West African peanut sauce,

29:56.044 --> 29:58.838
braised goat and bok choy, edamame beans.

29:59.506 --> 30:01.800
If you were to say, like, who I am,

30:01.883 --> 30:03.676
you can get
everything about me in one dish,

30:03.760 --> 30:04.886
this is what I would say.

30:08.139 --> 30:09.390
[laughs]

30:09.474 --> 30:12.519
[Phil] Wow. If this is who you are,
you are delicious.

30:13.353 --> 30:14.354
You're great.

30:14.896 --> 30:19.776
[Phil] The next dish is JJ's take
on a West African classic: jollof rice.

30:19.859 --> 30:22.111
It's spicy rice
with a stewed eggplant curry.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.615
Deceptively simple.
Unbelievably delicious.

30:25.698 --> 30:28.326
People have Twitter wars
about who makes the best jollof rice,

30:28.409 --> 30:29.619
Nigeria or Ghana.

30:31.246 --> 30:32.956
-You!
-[laughs]

30:33.039 --> 30:33.957
That's delicious.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.960
That's comfort food and spicy and hot.

30:39.003 --> 30:42.382
So I'm going to bring over
these, like, crazy, crazy short ribs.

30:42.590 --> 30:44.843
Like Fred Flintstone.

30:44.926 --> 30:46.594
Yes! Beef ribs, look!

30:47.387 --> 30:49.889
[Phil] Here's
where JJ's Caribbean roots really shine.

30:50.306 --> 30:54.143
Braised short ribs and peanut sauce
with rice, beans, and roti.

30:54.227 --> 30:57.647
This is
my great aunt's roti recipe from Barbados.

30:57.730 --> 30:59.107
[Phil] Oh, so you can make a thing.

30:59.190 --> 31:00.233
That's what I recommend.

31:01.192 --> 31:04.070
We'll bump it,
and then we'll deconstruct it.

31:04.779 --> 31:06.739
[Phil] Look at that. Butter knife.

31:14.414 --> 31:15.373
Yeah, I'm in heaven.

31:15.456 --> 31:16.416
[JJ] That's good.

31:16.499 --> 31:17.959
[Phil] The meat's beautifully cooked.

31:18.042 --> 31:20.044
That is spicy and nice.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.838
And that peanut butter sauce, come on.

31:22.797 --> 31:25.174
-What are you having?
-Bass. Veggie burger.

31:25.258 --> 31:27.969
-Did you have the short ribs?
-[man] Not yet.

31:28.052 --> 31:29.679
[JJ] You're giving it to them?

31:29.762 --> 31:31.639
I give one to them and I give one to...

31:31.973 --> 31:32.807
Nice.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.560
-[woman] Thank you.
-[Phil] Sure.

31:37.729 --> 31:40.857
-It's like I dipped it in a piranha tank.
-[JJ] So I told you you could do it.

31:48.114 --> 31:49.574
[chanting in Hindi]

32:01.294 --> 32:04.881
[Phil] It's Saturday morning
at the Ganesh temple in Flushing, Queens.

32:06.466 --> 32:09.010
I have no idea how things work
at a place like this,

32:09.093 --> 32:12.764
so I'm very lucky that
Rupa Balasubramanian is in town.

32:13.264 --> 32:14.807
I know Rupa from L.A.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.768
I just wrote to her,
"Would this interest you?"

32:16.851 --> 32:18.061
She goes, "Would it?

32:18.144 --> 32:20.813
That's the temple I went to
as a kid growing up in Queens."

32:20.897 --> 32:21.814
I had no idea.

32:21.898 --> 32:24.651
I was a little baby
walking through these halls.

32:24.734 --> 32:27.654
[Phil] Joining us is
the amazing Indian chef Floyd Cardoz

32:27.737 --> 32:29.739
of Bombay Bread Bar in Manhattan.

32:29.822 --> 32:31.616
I first came here because of the food.

32:32.200 --> 32:34.118
And then my wife used to bring me here.

32:34.202 --> 32:35.578
We lived not far from this temple.

32:35.662 --> 32:37.372
It's one of the biggest in Queens.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.165
-So wait a minute.
-It's the crown jewel.

32:39.248 --> 32:41.709
-You came because of the food.
-I came because of the food, yes.

32:41.793 --> 32:45.004
[Phil] Just downstairs is some
of the best Indian food in the city,

32:45.088 --> 32:47.423
but first, Ganesh beckons.

32:48.007 --> 32:48.925
[Phil] Thank you.

32:49.550 --> 32:52.220
They give you one flower as a blessing.

32:52.428 --> 32:54.430
[Phil] This is Dr. Uma. She's in charge.

32:54.931 --> 32:57.266
I brought flowers today,
but other offerings might include

32:57.350 --> 33:01.312
incense, milk, and fruits,
notably coconuts.

33:01.396 --> 33:03.439
So what is
the significance of the coconut?

33:03.523 --> 33:05.024
-When you break the coconut...
-Yeah.

33:05.108 --> 33:06.526
...you're letting your ego go.

33:07.694 --> 33:10.154
-Therefore you surrender to the...
-You sure you want to do it?

33:10.238 --> 33:11.656
This might be very difficult for me.

33:11.739 --> 33:13.491
It's not so easy. It has a technique.

33:13.574 --> 33:16.869
-Is there a coconut breaking area?
-Yes, indeed.

33:18.746 --> 33:20.748
-[Phil] Here it is. How convenient.
-[Rupa] Go, Phil.

33:24.627 --> 33:25.837
[Rupa] Put that bicep into it.

33:26.504 --> 33:29.048
-I guess my ego's pretty sturdy.
-[Floyd] Throw it.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.967
-Throw it? Like...
-[Floyd] No! No.

33:31.384 --> 33:32.468
[Rupa] Or that.

33:33.344 --> 33:36.389
-My ego is now shattered. Good?
-[Rupa] That's good.

33:36.931 --> 33:39.017
-And now comes the eating?
-[Floyd] The good part.

33:39.100 --> 33:41.310
[Phil] Floyd and Rupa
lead me and my shattered ego

33:41.394 --> 33:44.063
down to the temple's
famous community canteen,

33:44.147 --> 33:45.940
which specializes in dosas,

33:46.065 --> 33:50.319
South Indian vegetarian pancakes
made of fermented rice and lentils

33:50.820 --> 33:53.906
and then they're stuffed
or served with dips and sauces.

33:53.990 --> 33:55.616
Floyd seems to be ordering all of them.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.535
-Rava masala dosa.
-Mm-hmm.

33:57.618 --> 34:00.163
-Mysore masala dosa. One paper dosa.
-A paper dosa.

34:00.246 --> 34:02.415
-With the uttapam.
-[Rupa] Yeah, the onion chili uttapam.

34:02.957 --> 34:05.334
[Phil] In fact it's so much,
it all can't fit on the table.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.712
[Floyd] We need to annex another country.

34:07.795 --> 34:08.629
[Rupa laughs]

34:09.630 --> 34:11.049
[Phil] Okay, what will I start with?

34:11.132 --> 34:12.925
First thing I'd eat
is the rava masala dosa.

34:13.009 --> 34:15.261
-Yes. That's my favorite thing.
-It's made from semolina.

34:15.762 --> 34:16.596
[Phil] What's that?

34:16.679 --> 34:17.638
[Floyd] That is onion.

34:17.722 --> 34:19.265
-Yeah.
-And chili.

34:19.348 --> 34:20.183
Oh, yeah.

34:20.266 --> 34:21.184
[Rupa] And curry leaf.

34:23.811 --> 34:26.147
-Mm! Never had this!
-[Rupa] So good.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.857
-Now you got to get this.
-Paper dosa.

34:27.940 --> 34:29.609
Oh.

34:29.692 --> 34:32.320
-Now my inclination-- To dip--
-Dip. Dip.

34:32.403 --> 34:33.863
-Dip in sambar and chutney.
-Love it.

34:34.322 --> 34:36.657
[Rupa] That's the coconut
that you broke outside.

34:36.741 --> 34:38.242
In that chutney.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.660
[Phil] It's so good.

34:40.203 --> 34:41.245
Never had this.

34:41.788 --> 34:43.372
[Rupa] When growing up,
I had people say,

34:43.456 --> 34:45.208
"You're Indian. You're so lucky.

34:45.291 --> 34:47.960
You get to eat
chicken tikka masala all the time."

34:48.086 --> 34:50.338
No. That's not what South Indian food is.

34:50.421 --> 34:51.881
That's not what real Indian food is.

34:52.423 --> 34:57.428
So everything that I get from the Indian
restaurants that I know is northern?

34:57.512 --> 34:59.722
It's Northern Indian
and most of it is not home food.

35:00.264 --> 35:01.390
This is home food.

35:01.474 --> 35:02.809
-What I grew up on.
-So different.

35:02.892 --> 35:04.811
[Phil] And Rupa turned out pretty well.

35:04.894 --> 35:06.437
[Floyd] I'm gonna make you something.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.355
[Phil] Okay.

35:07.438 --> 35:08.314
Are you going to put--

35:11.109 --> 35:12.568
[Phil] Potato inside?

35:12.652 --> 35:14.570
In India we love starch on starch.

35:14.654 --> 35:16.572
Rice dosa with potato.

35:16.656 --> 35:18.199
Rice and potato curry.

35:18.282 --> 35:20.034
-Starch on starch.
-Rice.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.662
The equivalent of putting
the french fries into the sandwich.

35:22.745 --> 35:23.955
Right.

35:24.747 --> 35:27.166
I'm loving this.
It's like a thick scallion pancake.

35:27.250 --> 35:28.084
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

35:28.167 --> 35:29.293
[Rupa] Super pancake.

35:30.336 --> 35:32.505
I dressed as that for Halloween one year.

35:32.588 --> 35:33.798
[laughs]

35:45.143 --> 35:47.270
[Phil] Coney Island is this magical place.

35:47.353 --> 35:49.438
Steeplechase Park. Luna Park.

35:50.064 --> 35:53.734
This is where New York went
for recreation a hundred years ago.

35:54.235 --> 35:56.404
And they had this ride

35:56.487 --> 35:58.531
that was just a spinner,

35:58.614 --> 36:02.243
and people would just get shot out.
[makes shooting sounds] Like this.

36:03.202 --> 36:05.496
This was before the invention
of the lawsuit, by the way.

36:07.165 --> 36:10.459
That's what I think New York is like.
You're spinning around, then you get--

36:10.543 --> 36:14.130
When you can't take it anymore, you're
shot out to where you're supposed to live.

36:14.213 --> 36:17.133
For me it was Los Angeles.
For people, it's all over the world.

36:17.216 --> 36:19.760
For some people they can hang on.
And they live in New York.

36:21.262 --> 36:23.931
One of the benefits of hanging on
is this place right here.

36:25.183 --> 36:26.225
I had coupons.

36:26.309 --> 36:31.147
I think it was three hot dogs
for two dollars and 25 cents in 1983.

36:31.314 --> 36:34.567
Yeah, and because it was a deal,
I would eat three hot dogs at lunch.

36:34.734 --> 36:35.651
Very smart.

36:36.444 --> 36:39.655
[Phil] A hundred years ago this genius
named Nathan Handwerker

36:39.739 --> 36:42.909
saw that all the hot dogs were a dime.

36:42.992 --> 36:46.287
And he thought "What if I made
a better one and charged a nickel?"

36:46.954 --> 36:48.706
That's why you've heard of Nathan's.

36:49.999 --> 36:51.459
I wish I had a coupon.

36:51.959 --> 36:53.252
[man] Which one do you want?

36:53.336 --> 36:54.921
-Come on. Really?
-No, for real.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.006
-Here.
-[Phil] Aren't you sweet?

36:57.089 --> 37:00.301
-What's your favorite thing?
-Actually, I prefer the fish and chips.

37:00.384 --> 37:01.552
With the coupon.

37:01.886 --> 37:02.803
Coupon!

37:02.887 --> 37:04.138
Have a good one. [chuckles]

37:04.722 --> 37:05.890
You're the best!

37:08.226 --> 37:10.853
I got ten hot dogs. I don't know
what you guys are going to eat.

37:11.979 --> 37:14.148
Aren't you great? Thank you, dear.

37:14.815 --> 37:15.983
Who wants a hot dog?

37:17.360 --> 37:18.194
Thank you.

37:18.277 --> 37:19.820
-Lindsey, that's for you.
-Thank you.

37:19.904 --> 37:22.073
All right, dear. Share with the people.

37:22.990 --> 37:23.824
[Phil] Oh, my God.

37:25.534 --> 37:26.535
[Phil] And we're back.

37:29.205 --> 37:31.040
Oh. Hello, old friend.

37:36.754 --> 37:38.172
It's the perfect thing.

37:40.132 --> 37:43.177
These crinkle-cut fries...

37:46.305 --> 37:49.809
were always part of the experience.

37:51.227 --> 37:53.854
What is it? Why are these so damn good?

37:55.189 --> 37:56.190
This is New York to me.

37:58.192 --> 37:59.068
This is New York.

38:01.988 --> 38:03.739
[Phil]
And here's another famous New Yorker.

38:05.324 --> 38:10.454
One of the greatest comedy minds
in our lifetime

38:10.538 --> 38:11.747
is Elaine May.

38:13.124 --> 38:14.792
Perhaps you've
heard of Nichols and May.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.460
If you haven't heard of Nichols and May,

38:16.544 --> 38:18.671
they revolutionized comedy.

38:19.255 --> 38:22.216
Elaine went on to do
A New Leaf and The Heartbreak Kid

38:22.300 --> 38:24.427
and she ghostwrote Tootsie.

38:24.510 --> 38:27.471
And I'm a friend of hers.
I don't know how that happened.

38:27.555 --> 38:29.557
I wanted to do something special with her,

38:29.640 --> 38:34.645
so I took her to my new favorite
ice cream place called Ice and Vice.

38:35.855 --> 38:37.440
[Phil] These are the flavors today.

38:37.523 --> 38:38.899
We're going to taste all of them.

38:38.983 --> 38:41.235
And then the one you like,
we'll make a thing out of.

38:42.236 --> 38:44.196
[Phil] A thing
like one of these crazy cones

38:44.280 --> 38:47.491
and the outrageous flavors
that helped Ice and Vice win awards

38:47.575 --> 38:52.455
and go from a small street cart to
a Lower East Side ice cream destination.

38:52.538 --> 38:55.166
I consider this the Academy Award
of ice cream tasting.

38:55.249 --> 38:57.001
It is. They already won the Vendy's.

38:57.084 --> 38:58.753
-The next stop is the Oscars.
-Exactly.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.963
I would suggest trying the vanilla first.

39:01.922 --> 39:03.883
[Phil] Look at those nails.
Who needs a scooper?

39:04.258 --> 39:06.844
Mexican vanilla with black lava sea salt.

39:07.928 --> 39:09.055
Hm.

39:10.973 --> 39:12.600
It tastes very white.

39:12.683 --> 39:13.809
[chuckles]

39:13.893 --> 39:18.105
Creamy, yet with a slight fruity taste
that I can't define.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.858
It has a lot of textures, a lot of depth.

39:20.941 --> 39:22.526
I love how serious you are about this.

39:22.610 --> 39:25.029
I've never seen you
so serious about anything.

39:25.112 --> 39:27.907
My favorite one is
buckwheat honey with turmeric

39:27.990 --> 39:30.034
and sunflower seed butterscotch chip.

39:30.117 --> 39:31.327
[Elaine] The next nominee?

39:33.204 --> 39:34.246
Mm.

39:34.330 --> 39:36.415
Really dramatic taste, yet with humor.

39:36.499 --> 39:37.833
-I love that.
-[server] Yes.

39:38.376 --> 39:39.460
Very good for you.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.170
-You know turmeric?
-I eat it all the time.

39:41.253 --> 39:42.838
I'm almost yellow from it.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.048
[server laughs]

39:44.131 --> 39:45.841
This one right here is Opium Den.

39:45.925 --> 39:46.759
Oh.

39:46.842 --> 39:51.055
Inside is lemon bread crouton
with poppy seed and white sesame.

39:51.430 --> 39:54.183
It is an opium-like flavor
from my experience.

39:54.266 --> 39:55.893
Have you ever been to an opium den?

39:55.976 --> 39:58.020
Of course. I picked the best opium.

39:58.771 --> 40:00.106
So this is 9AM.

40:00.189 --> 40:02.942
It is a Vietnamese coffee
with donut truffle.

40:03.901 --> 40:07.196
Well. There are hints,
oddly enough, of Cuban tobacco.

40:07.279 --> 40:08.864
-Just the lightest bit. Yes.
-Wow.

40:08.948 --> 40:10.449
This is some palate you've got there.

40:10.950 --> 40:12.493
I've tasted a lot of things in my life.

40:14.120 --> 40:16.872
[server] So, Shade
is a smoked dark chocolate.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.419
Yum.

40:21.836 --> 40:23.003
Yum is a good--

40:23.087 --> 40:24.296
Well, I'm trying to be brief.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.843
[Phil] Next come
the most unusual flavor nominees:

40:28.926 --> 40:29.885
peach jalapeno,

40:30.469 --> 40:33.848
yuzu with coconut milk,
and Swedish Fish.

40:33.931 --> 40:36.851
As crazy as that flavor is,
it's delicious, isn't it?

40:36.934 --> 40:39.520
I want to say this now.
No matter who gets the award,

40:39.603 --> 40:41.564
it's an honor just to be nominated.

40:41.647 --> 40:42.523
[Phil chuckles]

40:42.606 --> 40:44.442
-[Phil] Is that the last one?
-[server] Yeah.

40:44.525 --> 40:47.153
They're all delicious.
This is going to be so hard.

40:47.236 --> 40:50.197
I like that you put
this undue pressure on yourself.

40:50.489 --> 40:52.450
It's relatively important.

40:53.742 --> 40:56.871
For complexity, for depth...

40:56.954 --> 40:58.622
-Yeah.
-...for originality,

40:58.914 --> 41:00.833
I will have to go with the 9AM.

41:00.916 --> 41:01.750
[gasps]

41:02.376 --> 41:04.670
Congratulations, 9AM.

41:04.753 --> 41:06.964
And you've all been wonderful.
If nothing--

41:07.047 --> 41:09.383
You've all been delicious.
Every one of you.

41:10.050 --> 41:13.512
And I think 9AM shares this
with all of you.

41:14.388 --> 41:16.307
I think Blue Purple
is giving you the finger.

41:16.390 --> 41:17.475
[all laugh]

41:18.851 --> 41:19.852
Good?

41:20.394 --> 41:22.938
-I just ate some paper around the--
-How was that?

41:23.022 --> 41:24.773
-Delicious.
-Even the paper is good.

41:25.733 --> 41:27.276
[Phil] Look, I got three scoops!

41:27.359 --> 41:29.570
I love you, Anastasia. Look at that.

41:34.116 --> 41:35.451
Excellent.

41:35.534 --> 41:36.952
You have some cone in your hair.

41:37.495 --> 41:38.787
Of course she does. She's Elaine!

41:42.666 --> 41:44.919
[Phil] You can draw
a straight line from Elaine May

41:45.002 --> 41:48.339
to America's comedy institution,
Saturday Night Live.

41:48.923 --> 41:52.968
And one of the greatest
all-time performers is this guy.

41:54.386 --> 41:55.721
Tracy Morgan, everybody.

41:55.804 --> 41:57.056
This is Russ and Daughters.

41:57.806 --> 42:00.017
He said, "What is this?"
I said, "It's soul food."

42:02.645 --> 42:03.854
I didn't say your soul.

42:04.563 --> 42:08.192
In 1914, Joel Russ opened
a small appetizing shop

42:08.275 --> 42:09.360
on the Lower East Side

42:09.443 --> 42:10.986
selling Jewish delicacies

42:11.070 --> 42:14.823
like lox, cream cheese,
pickled herring, bagels, and more.

42:14.907 --> 42:18.035
Four generations later,
his descendants still run the place,

42:18.452 --> 42:21.830
and recently they opened a beautiful
sit-down restaurant around the corner.

42:21.914 --> 42:23.290
-[Tracy] It's history.
-[Phil] Yes.

42:23.374 --> 42:25.000
So, that's what I love about New York.

42:25.084 --> 42:25.918
-History.
-Yeah.

42:26.669 --> 42:27.586
You look at it.

42:27.670 --> 42:29.672
-Yeah.
-The curb on every street is this big.

42:29.755 --> 42:31.257
-Right.
-You go to L.A., it's this big.

42:31.882 --> 42:35.094
-That's how old this town is.
-Oh, we've worn it down.

42:35.177 --> 42:37.012
Yeah, we worn it down.

42:38.055 --> 42:39.390
-Hello!
-[waiter] How we doing?

42:39.473 --> 42:41.058
-That's for me?
-[waiter] That is for you.

42:41.141 --> 42:42.309
[Phil] Chocolate egg cream.

42:42.601 --> 42:44.520
-I don't eat sugar.
-No sugar?

42:44.603 --> 42:45.521
-No sugar.
-All right.

42:45.604 --> 42:48.274
[Phil] This is an invention.
I think it comes from Brooklyn.

42:49.441 --> 42:51.277
-There's no egg, there's no cream.
-Excuse me.

42:51.819 --> 42:53.487
-You can't have it. It's sugar.
-I have to.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.447
-No, it's sugar.
-No, it'll be fine.

42:55.531 --> 42:57.074
He never had an egg cream before.

42:57.157 --> 43:00.035
[Phil] It's chocolate syrup,
usually Fox's U-Bet.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.997
Milk. And then when you add the seltzer,

43:03.581 --> 43:05.165
it has this chemical reaction.

43:10.004 --> 43:10.838
[Phil] You like it!

43:10.921 --> 43:12.548
Way beyond liking it. I love it.

43:13.048 --> 43:15.926
I don't want you to drink
that whole thing because I care about you.

43:16.010 --> 43:18.345
[slurping]

43:18.429 --> 43:20.180
I killed Tracy Morgan today.

43:20.264 --> 43:21.390
[Tracy laughs]

43:24.727 --> 43:26.270
-[Phil] Oh, here we go.
-[Tracy] Oh, God!

43:26.353 --> 43:28.355
-What's going on?
-[waiter] Your potato latkes.

43:28.439 --> 43:29.815
[Phil] Latkes! You know what it is?

43:30.190 --> 43:31.317
Is that like a knish?

43:31.400 --> 43:34.028
It's like a knish. But not a knish.

43:34.111 --> 43:35.821
Potato pancakes.

43:35.904 --> 43:38.115
Well, you should've put
some mozzarella cheese on it.

43:38.657 --> 43:40.492
He never had what was called appetizing.

43:41.619 --> 43:43.037
I love this!

43:43.120 --> 43:44.663
I love turning people onto stuff I love.

43:45.331 --> 43:46.624
You're going to try this.

43:47.249 --> 43:48.542
You see how thin they slice it?

43:48.626 --> 43:50.085
It's an art form.

43:50.169 --> 43:54.089
We got to fry this. You got to put it
in some flour and fry it.

43:54.173 --> 43:55.215
That's my thing.

43:55.924 --> 43:56.967
I understand.

43:57.509 --> 43:59.511
You want to know what's my favorite meal?

43:59.595 --> 44:00.721
-Yes.
-Can I tell you?

44:00.804 --> 44:03.223
-Yes.
-Besides high school school lunch.

44:03.849 --> 44:07.311
Because school lunch is still in effect.
I love school lunch.

44:07.978 --> 44:09.855
-I love school lunch.
-[Phil] All right.

44:09.938 --> 44:11.357
[loudly] I love school lunch!

44:11.899 --> 44:14.860
Now, my favorite meal, of all time,

44:15.235 --> 44:18.489
I call it
"hot dog and pork and bean casserole"

44:18.572 --> 44:21.533
on a tin plate... with a fork.

44:22.493 --> 44:23.619
You know what my dad said?

44:24.453 --> 44:26.997
Try everything in life once.

44:27.081 --> 44:28.290
-Herring?
-No.

44:28.374 --> 44:30.250
[laughs]

44:30.334 --> 44:32.836
How's your health now?
It's been how many years?

44:32.920 --> 44:35.214
Three years since I got hit by that truck.

44:35.297 --> 44:38.050
How long after the accident
did you host Saturday Night Live?

44:38.133 --> 44:39.051
-A year?
-No. 14 months.

44:39.134 --> 44:40.135
Fourteen months.

44:40.678 --> 44:42.262
I thought you were better than ever.

44:42.346 --> 44:43.305
Thank you.

44:43.389 --> 44:45.516
You were effortless that night.

44:46.016 --> 44:47.810
It wasn't like that, Phil.
It wasn't like that.

44:47.893 --> 44:49.478
-There are two shows on SNL.
-Uh-huh.

44:50.479 --> 44:52.564
The dress show. Air show.

44:53.190 --> 44:55.818
During the dress show, I flubbed a lot.

44:56.026 --> 44:57.319
I spoke to Lorne.

44:57.569 --> 44:58.445
Yeah.

44:58.529 --> 44:59.780
Now Lorne is like a dad to me.

45:01.240 --> 45:02.908
I said, "Lorne, I'm not sure
I can do it."

45:03.701 --> 45:05.119
He said, "Tracy...

45:05.911 --> 45:08.914
people don't care about funny.
They're just glad you're here."

45:08.997 --> 45:10.958
-That's right.
-"They're just glad you're here."

45:11.041 --> 45:13.127
That's a very sweet thing
to say and true.

45:14.086 --> 45:15.504
[Phil] But you're also funny.

45:15.587 --> 45:19.425
I told you, Phil, when we first met,
"We are friends forever."

45:20.384 --> 45:24.930
I ain't ask why I felt
a connection with you. I know why.

45:25.889 --> 45:28.767
Because in the last life,
we were probably cousins like this.

45:29.309 --> 45:31.103
Phil coming over at the family picnic?

45:31.186 --> 45:32.688
Phil coming over? Yes!

45:32.771 --> 45:33.772
[laughs]

45:45.033 --> 45:47.453
This is my picnic
in Central Park with ballerinas.

45:48.871 --> 45:52.499
There was an event at my hotel
and I met these real ballet dancers.

45:53.751 --> 45:56.170
Elina dances
with the American Ballet Theatre.

45:56.503 --> 45:58.672
Abigail's a freelance dancer
and a teacher.

45:58.756 --> 46:01.675
And Georgina is a soloist
with the New York City Ballet.

46:01.759 --> 46:03.844
And I see the way they're eating
and I'm like, "Wow!"

46:03.927 --> 46:06.263
I was impressed. I didn't think
they ate. "Well, sure we do!"

46:06.346 --> 46:10.017
So, I thought,
"You eat, I eat. Let's eat a lot."

46:10.184 --> 46:12.811
I would do what you're doing
if I weren't dancing. I would go--

46:12.895 --> 46:14.354
-You're doing it now.
-We are.

46:14.438 --> 46:18.066
How about-- Let's start
with Charles Pan Fried Chicken.

46:18.150 --> 46:20.027
-Hell yeah. [chuckles]
-Nice!

46:20.110 --> 46:22.821
[Phil] I'm here to tell you
it's a myth that ballerinas don't eat.

46:22.905 --> 46:25.991
And I'm going to show you
with some of New York's finest takeout.

46:26.074 --> 46:27.993
-[Abigail] Good fried chicken.
-[all] Mm.

46:28.076 --> 46:29.745
-[Phil] Do you know Faicco's?
-[Abigail] No.

46:29.828 --> 46:32.498
[Phil] They make giant hero sandwiches.

46:32.581 --> 46:33.665
[Elina] Yes, thank you.

46:35.292 --> 46:36.418
[Elina] Holy cow.

46:37.085 --> 46:38.629
[Abigail] Brilliant!

46:38.712 --> 46:41.757
We're gonna have pastrami sandwiches.
This is the reigning champion.

46:41.840 --> 46:43.634
-This is-- Katz's?
-[Abigail] Katz's.

46:43.717 --> 46:45.260
All right. Here we go. You ready?

46:49.264 --> 46:50.140
[Phil] Do we like it?

46:50.224 --> 46:51.433
[Georgina] I like it!

46:51.517 --> 46:54.520
[Phil] Here's the challenger.
This is Harry and Ida's.

46:57.356 --> 46:58.190
What do you think?

46:58.273 --> 47:01.235
[Abigail] I appreciate the classic...
but I'm into this.

47:01.777 --> 47:03.946
[Phil] Then we have more sandwiches
from Harry and Ida's.

47:04.029 --> 47:05.823
-There's so many sandwiches.
-But know what?

47:06.865 --> 47:09.034
This one is smoked bluefish.

47:09.117 --> 47:11.286
-You're into it. You are--
-[Elina] I'm into this one.

47:11.370 --> 47:13.372
[Phil] You're from Finland.
You like smoked fish.

47:13.872 --> 47:15.207
I have a specialty.

47:15.958 --> 47:16.834
Chocolate egg cream.

47:19.419 --> 47:22.631
This is from Han Dynasty.
These are called dan dan noodles.

47:22.965 --> 47:24.758
[Georgina] Sorry, technical difficulties.

47:24.842 --> 47:27.386
I'm going to have to literally just...

47:27.970 --> 47:29.304
Very impressive.

47:30.180 --> 47:33.183
Do you think ballet dancers
are stronger, more powerful now

47:33.267 --> 47:35.018
than they were like 30 years ago?

47:35.102 --> 47:35.978
[Georgina] Absolutely.

47:36.061 --> 47:38.981
Yes, it's becoming less art and more--

47:39.064 --> 47:40.899
-Gymnastics--
-It should go to the Olympics now.

47:40.983 --> 47:43.193
-Look at how ice skating has changed.
-[Phil] Right.

47:43.443 --> 47:45.404
It used to be a double axel,
now it's triple axel.

47:45.487 --> 47:48.073
And now men do like quadruples and...

47:48.156 --> 47:49.408
-So that--
-Till somebody dies.

47:49.491 --> 47:51.159
[all laugh]

47:51.243 --> 47:53.328
Did you have enough savory?

47:53.871 --> 47:54.872
-Oh, yeah.
-Um...

47:54.955 --> 47:56.957
-[Paulette] My goodness.
-Paulette, everybody.

47:57.040 --> 47:57.875
Hi!

47:58.417 --> 48:01.628
[Phil] Paulette Goto is a great friend
and a fantastic pastry chef.

48:01.712 --> 48:03.088
She gives New York food tours

48:03.171 --> 48:05.340
and is on the Cooking Channel
and Food Network.

48:06.258 --> 48:08.343
[all] Oh!

48:09.386 --> 48:12.014
-Ready? One, two, three!
-One, two, three!

48:13.599 --> 48:14.975
[Paulette] That's what's up.

48:15.809 --> 48:17.477
-That piece is bigger than you!
-I'm ready.

48:18.520 --> 48:21.231
This is chocolate with chocolate...
and more chocolate.

48:21.315 --> 48:22.441
-Amazing.
-It's brilliant.

48:22.524 --> 48:24.693
-This is-- This is called heaven.
-It is heaven.

48:25.319 --> 48:27.946
If I had to choose between dance and food,
I'd choose food.

48:28.405 --> 48:30.532
[Abigail] On that note...

48:33.410 --> 48:37.456
Yes, this is how I always imagined
my life in New York would be.

48:37.539 --> 48:39.833
Shall we dance? Let's go.

48:41.585 --> 48:42.878
[Abigail] Whoo whoo!

48:42.961 --> 48:46.715
I can't do any ballet moves
because literally my pants are splitting.

48:46.798 --> 48:48.008
[laughing]

48:48.091 --> 48:48.926
[Abigail] Just one.

48:49.801 --> 48:50.844
No, I can't!

48:52.930 --> 48:55.557
Come on. Come on. Come on.

49:07.402 --> 49:08.695
[Phil] New York has everything.

49:09.237 --> 49:13.700
You could see a new type of theater,
show, ballet, opera--

49:13.784 --> 49:17.871
You could eat in a new restaurant
every meal. You'd never catch up.

49:18.705 --> 49:19.831
There's so much

49:19.915 --> 49:23.418
and it just keeps spreading out
further and further and further.

49:23.794 --> 49:27.381
In fact one of my favorite places is
actually a half hour north of Manhattan

49:27.464 --> 49:28.507
in the Hudson Valley.

49:32.636 --> 49:35.263
So, Stone Barns...

49:35.347 --> 49:38.183
was a Rockefeller estate,
and it's now an agricultural center.

49:38.892 --> 49:43.146
And Dan Barber and his brother have
a restaurant in there called Blue Hill.

49:45.691 --> 49:47.859
Whenever I go,
if you go at a different season,

49:48.193 --> 49:49.987
you know, you're going to get
a different meal.

49:51.697 --> 49:53.281
I'm going to go ahead and say

49:53.365 --> 49:56.034
this is my favorite restaurant
in the United States.

49:56.118 --> 49:57.744
Yes. This place.

50:02.958 --> 50:05.293
Everything is from this genius
named Dan Barber

50:05.377 --> 50:07.629
who's not just the chef,
but he's a visionary.

50:09.381 --> 50:11.758
He and his team have developed
a more nutritious wheat...

50:12.634 --> 50:14.261
a more nutritious butternut squash.

50:14.845 --> 50:18.348
He's working
towards nutrition and sustainability

50:18.432 --> 50:22.477
and making every single thing delicious.

50:25.105 --> 50:27.524
That is until he decided
to get me involved.

50:31.862 --> 50:34.072
I feel like a lady in the 1800s.

50:34.156 --> 50:36.616
Comedy is your thing,
sausage is his thing.

50:36.700 --> 50:39.077
-There's probably a lot of overlap.
-They're very similar.

50:39.161 --> 50:40.704
Never show someone
how you write a joke,

50:40.787 --> 50:42.247
and never show the sausage making.

50:42.330 --> 50:44.624
-So turn off the cameras, right?
-That's right. Go ahead.

50:45.417 --> 50:47.294
-[man] All right. So ground pork.
-[Phil] Yes.

50:47.377 --> 50:50.464
[man] Beets that have been
roasted, chopped, pureed.

50:50.547 --> 50:53.091
There's no art to this
other than you got to get in there.

50:53.175 --> 50:54.468
This is it.

50:54.551 --> 50:55.761
Okay, there is an art to it.

50:55.844 --> 50:56.928
[laughs]

50:58.096 --> 50:59.056
Go for it.

50:59.556 --> 51:01.892
-You really wanna get in there and like...
-Am I not?

51:01.975 --> 51:04.603
[man] You want to get the stuff
from the bottom to the top there.

51:04.686 --> 51:08.857
[Phil] Yes! That's how I made my fortune.
Going from the bottom to the top.

51:09.816 --> 51:11.693
-[man] Now's the fun part.
-[Phil] This is it.

51:11.777 --> 51:13.779
[man] We're going to stuff this
into a sheep casing.

51:13.862 --> 51:15.155
That's sheep intestine.

51:16.573 --> 51:19.076
-All right? Here we go. All right?
-[Phil] Yeah.

51:19.618 --> 51:23.246
Oh! Oh! Magic!

51:23.330 --> 51:25.540
It's like an organ grinder and his monkey.

51:25.624 --> 51:26.458
[man chuckles]

51:27.000 --> 51:27.834
[man] All right.

51:27.918 --> 51:31.588
[Phil] It's beautiful! Look at it!
This is sausage. Come on!

51:35.467 --> 51:37.052
[Phil] As a 20-something year old,

51:37.177 --> 51:41.473
I would read in The New York Times
about these magical places

51:41.556 --> 51:43.642
called four-star restaurants.

51:44.351 --> 51:46.269
And once a year, on my birthday...

51:47.104 --> 51:50.649
I would save up
to go to one of these places.

51:51.191 --> 51:54.528
And my friend Rob, my roommate,
he was also stupid like me.

51:54.611 --> 51:57.114
And we would save up,
and we couldn't afford dates.

51:57.197 --> 51:59.032
We would split a girl.

52:01.409 --> 52:02.244
We'd take one girl.

52:03.370 --> 52:07.040
But the point is... the sharing of this.

52:07.124 --> 52:08.583
Oh, Phil!

52:09.251 --> 52:11.795
And so tonight
I'm with the great chef Alon Shaya

52:11.878 --> 52:13.880
and the date we're splitting
is his wife, Emily.

52:13.964 --> 52:15.257
And you have not been here yet?

52:15.340 --> 52:17.592
-No, first time.
-I couldn't be more excited.

52:22.180 --> 52:24.683
[Phil] Eating at Blue Hill
can be a three, four-hour--

52:24.766 --> 52:26.268
Five-hour meal I've had there once.

52:26.351 --> 52:31.148
I usually don't like this kind of thing.
I get tired. My back hurts.

52:31.731 --> 52:32.649
[Alon] Wait a minute.

52:32.732 --> 52:34.317
[waiter] Vegetable sushi.

52:34.860 --> 52:36.695
And then you taste the food.

52:36.778 --> 52:38.488
It's--
You've never had anything like it.

52:38.989 --> 52:39.990
[Alon] Tastes like sushi.

52:40.073 --> 52:41.491
Because the vinegar and rice.

52:41.575 --> 52:43.910
I love bites like this
where they're so pure.

52:43.994 --> 52:44.828
[Phil] Yeah.

52:44.911 --> 52:47.914
This answers the question,
how do you make vegetables exciting?

52:47.998 --> 52:50.000
Nothing is too ungapatchka.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.376
You know what ungapatchka means?

52:51.459 --> 52:53.545
It means when there's
too much stuff on something.

52:54.254 --> 52:55.088
Ungapatchka.

52:55.172 --> 52:56.173
Look at this.

52:57.632 --> 53:00.302
This is dinner and a show.

53:00.385 --> 53:02.220
You're never in one spot very long.

53:02.304 --> 53:04.014
-It's like Game of Thrones.
-[Emily] Yeah.

53:04.389 --> 53:06.266
-[Phil] These are my enemies.
-[Alon] Yeah!

53:06.349 --> 53:07.392
[all laugh]

53:07.475 --> 53:09.436
[Phil] This is a beet hot dog.

53:09.769 --> 53:11.479
I actually helped make these today.

53:11.563 --> 53:12.772
-[Emily] Really?
-[Phil] Yeah.

53:12.856 --> 53:15.984
I also love that we're
in kind of a big splurge restaurant,

53:16.067 --> 53:17.360
-eating hot dogs.
-[Emily] I know.

53:17.444 --> 53:19.946
[Alon] We're eating hot dogs.
Best hot dog I've ever had.

53:20.614 --> 53:21.448
Amazing.

53:21.531 --> 53:22.782
[Phil] The view's not bad, too.

53:23.491 --> 53:25.827
This was the original manure shed.

53:25.911 --> 53:27.621
It's where you're
having your next course.

53:27.704 --> 53:28.538
[Phil] Oh.

53:28.622 --> 53:30.165
[Emily] Wow.

53:30.248 --> 53:32.542
[Phil] Look at this manure shed.
It's nicer than my house.

53:32.626 --> 53:33.668
[Emily] Oh, wow.

53:33.752 --> 53:35.921
[Phil] The world's most beautiful
manure shed, everybody.

53:36.004 --> 53:39.007
-[Emily] This is really magical.
-We have live compost in this bin,

53:39.090 --> 53:42.552
-chugging away at 142 degrees.
-[Emily] Whoa.

53:45.013 --> 53:45.931
Oh, oh.

53:46.014 --> 53:48.225
-Raccoon! Did you see it?
-[Alon] Get him back here.

53:48.308 --> 53:50.143
[Phil] By the way, that's our next course.

53:50.227 --> 53:51.770
-[Emily laughs]
-[Alon] Very nice.

53:52.520 --> 53:54.064
Straight from the farm.

53:54.147 --> 53:56.233
What's happening? To mushrooms.

53:56.733 --> 53:59.027
[waitress]
So, on your plates are mushrooms

53:59.110 --> 54:01.738
that have been cooked in the compost
that we have right here.

54:02.822 --> 54:05.575
[Phil] When compost breaks down,
it naturally generates heat.

54:05.951 --> 54:07.702
And so Dan thought, "Why not cook in it?"

54:07.786 --> 54:08.828
'Cause he's a genius.

54:09.412 --> 54:11.456
[waiter] It's the ideal temperature
for poaching eggs.

54:11.539 --> 54:13.500
[all] Oh!

54:13.583 --> 54:15.877
[Phil] Beauty. Get in there.

54:15.961 --> 54:17.003
Oh, yes.

54:18.338 --> 54:20.215
-Isn't that amazing?
-[Emily] I like it.

54:20.298 --> 54:23.718
There's such thought behind everything.
You're learning stuff,

54:24.302 --> 54:26.596
you're entertained by the presentation,

54:27.138 --> 54:29.057
and it's delicious.

54:29.724 --> 54:32.727
And so we come to our finale
in the place where it all started.

54:33.812 --> 54:35.188
[Alon] Oh, it's the fish head.

54:36.189 --> 54:38.775
-[Emily] That's good stuff.
-[Phil] This is great! We're in Japan.

54:39.359 --> 54:41.319
Oh God, and there's
so much going on in the rice.

54:42.445 --> 54:46.449
The ingredients are the stars
of every single dish.

54:46.533 --> 54:50.829
Oh, that is beautiful.
Duck breast can be so boring, right?

54:50.912 --> 54:52.872
-[Alon] Not this one.
-[Emily] Yeah, not here.

54:52.956 --> 54:54.332
Mm-hmm.

54:54.416 --> 54:55.250
Emily!

54:56.668 --> 54:57.836
Smoky...

54:57.919 --> 54:58.795
So good.

54:58.878 --> 55:00.171
Sweet.

55:00.255 --> 55:01.089
Crispy.

55:01.172 --> 55:02.507
Ducky. [chuckles]

55:02.590 --> 55:03.591
[Emily] Ducky.

55:04.634 --> 55:06.845
[Dan] We had a squash breeder
ten years ago for dinner.

55:06.928 --> 55:08.388
"If you're such a great breeder,

55:08.513 --> 55:11.975
why don't you shrink this thing
and make it actually taste good?"

55:12.058 --> 55:13.018
This is honeynut.

55:13.101 --> 55:16.354
This is now in Costco,
Whole Foods, Trader Joe's.

55:16.438 --> 55:18.565
So it's concentrated nutrition, flavor...

55:18.648 --> 55:22.277
I'm going to give you the next generation.
No one has ever had the next generation.

55:22.360 --> 55:24.029
This is the thing,
we just got it yesterday.

55:25.780 --> 55:26.823
Ah!

55:28.033 --> 55:29.909
This is the craziest thing I've had.

55:29.993 --> 55:32.454
I didn't add salt. I didn't add butter.

55:32.620 --> 55:33.830
I didn't add pepper.

55:33.913 --> 55:35.749
Where is it getting the salt from?

55:37.292 --> 55:38.293
-I don't know.
-Amazing.

55:38.376 --> 55:40.086
-This is phenomenal.
-[Dan] Isn't that crazy?

55:40.503 --> 55:44.924
I learned the thing that makes the fruit
or the vegetable most nutritious,

55:45.342 --> 55:47.344
also makes it most delicious.

55:48.053 --> 55:50.764
-You know what's stupid? He left the pan.
-That is stupid.

55:50.847 --> 55:53.099
-[Phil] Before he's back.
-[Emily] Or we get in trouble.

55:53.183 --> 55:55.185
That was supposed to serve
three more customers.

55:55.268 --> 55:56.436
[Alon laughs]

55:57.270 --> 55:58.104
Whoa.

55:59.981 --> 56:03.485
[Dan] A roasted Gruyère oyster
with eggplant broth.

56:05.487 --> 56:07.530
-What?
-Let's all do the oyster dance.

56:09.324 --> 56:11.034
-That is so good.
-Yum!

56:12.577 --> 56:14.788
[Phil] Then they kicked us out
for dancing in the kitchen.

56:17.707 --> 56:21.252
We can't leave New York without visiting
the birthplace of the blues,

56:22.087 --> 56:23.421
my mother's kitchen.

56:23.505 --> 56:24.672
[Phil] Dad, you want soup?

56:24.756 --> 56:26.508
[Helen] How many people are we feeding?

56:26.633 --> 56:27.467
Just us.

56:28.009 --> 56:30.720
-Well, how many of the crew?
-Don't worry about the crew.

56:30.804 --> 56:32.764
Put in two more balls each.

56:32.847 --> 56:33.723
Max.

56:33.807 --> 56:36.184
[Phil] I make fun
of my mom's cooking. I've always done it.

56:36.267 --> 56:38.937
It made its way into Raymond.
It's part of the schtick.

56:39.020 --> 56:42.649
She does make something very good.

56:42.732 --> 56:44.234
It's her matzah ball soup.

56:44.984 --> 56:45.819
[Max] I'll do it.

56:45.902 --> 56:49.906
Max, I'm the chef.
You didn't have anything to do with this.

56:49.989 --> 56:52.033
-That's right. You did it all yourself.
-Right.

56:52.117 --> 56:54.244
You made the soup yourself?
The matzah balls yourself?

56:54.327 --> 56:55.745
-Yeah, with no help.
-[Phil] Right.

56:56.663 --> 56:58.206
Now whose recipe is this?

56:58.289 --> 56:59.124
My own.

56:59.207 --> 57:01.668
This is-- It wasn't adapted
from your mother?

57:02.210 --> 57:03.795
-No. No, I really--
-No?

57:03.878 --> 57:07.340
So this is not like some nice thing where
it's passed from generation to generation?

57:07.424 --> 57:09.592
-No.
-[Max] Yeah, you can say it. So say it.

57:09.676 --> 57:11.886
What the hell? It sounds better.

57:11.970 --> 57:13.179
[laughs]

57:13.680 --> 57:17.434
Now I've always thought
this was your best dish.

57:17.517 --> 57:18.560
It is.

57:18.643 --> 57:19.727
-[Helen] No.
-You think so?

57:19.811 --> 57:21.271
You have no competition.

57:21.729 --> 57:22.689
Let me taste it.

57:24.774 --> 57:25.608
[Phil] Yeah.

57:26.818 --> 57:28.069
What does that mean? Yeah.

57:28.570 --> 57:32.157
-I like it. I think it's very good, but...
-But what?

57:32.240 --> 57:33.366
I might be partial.

57:33.450 --> 57:35.910
I might need a second opinion. Hold on.

57:37.162 --> 57:38.163
What is this?

57:38.621 --> 57:39.914
-[Phil] Hello.
-Hello.

57:40.707 --> 57:41.624
-How are you?
-Good.

57:42.584 --> 57:43.543
-Who's he?
-[Phil] Come.

57:43.626 --> 57:44.461
Who's he?

57:44.544 --> 57:46.045
-Hi, Phil.
-This is my friend Dan.

57:46.129 --> 57:47.714
-Hi, Dan.
-He likes soup.

57:47.797 --> 57:49.090
Pleased to meet you.

57:49.507 --> 57:52.427
This is Daniel Boulud.
One of the world's greatest chefs.

57:53.386 --> 57:55.221
Matzah ball soup. That's my favorite.

57:55.305 --> 57:56.181
Good.

57:56.264 --> 57:59.809
So he's gonna try
Helen Rosenthal's matzah ball soup.

57:59.893 --> 58:01.186
Do you know who this is, Mom?

58:01.936 --> 58:02.770
[Max] What?

58:03.146 --> 58:07.442
You know nearby we have
Épicerie Boulud?

58:08.109 --> 58:09.319
-[Helen] Yes.
-And Boulud Sud?

58:09.611 --> 58:10.528
-[Helen] Yes.
-Right?

58:10.612 --> 58:12.739
-And the restaurant Daniel?
-Yes.

58:13.281 --> 58:14.741
This is Daniel Boulud.

58:14.824 --> 58:16.367
-I'm Daniel Boulud.
-Nice to meet you.

58:16.451 --> 58:17.535
Pleased to meet you, ma'am.

58:18.077 --> 58:22.165
I have on occasion made matzah ball soup.
Not that I grew up with it, but...

58:22.248 --> 58:23.166
Yeah.

58:23.750 --> 58:26.544
I love that-- Oh, my God.
This is very, very good.

58:26.628 --> 58:27.545
Wow, Ma!

58:28.004 --> 58:29.714
-[Max] See?
-You put herbs inside?

58:29.797 --> 58:31.549
-Yes.
-Some parsley?

58:31.633 --> 58:33.384
Or there was some dill? What was it?

58:33.468 --> 58:35.470
Parsley. Mostly.

58:35.553 --> 58:36.930
But do you put dill also?

58:37.013 --> 58:38.431
Yeah, I use a lot of dill.

58:38.515 --> 58:40.600
So you see, I brought the dill oil.

58:40.683 --> 58:41.768
[Phil] Oh!

58:41.851 --> 58:43.228
-She wants it.
-Thanks.

58:43.311 --> 58:45.396
-[Phil] She loves it.
-This olive oil's made with dill.

58:45.480 --> 58:48.024
Add a little bit on your soup
and you'll see.

58:48.107 --> 58:49.651
It's going to float on the surface.

58:49.734 --> 58:50.818
-[Max] Liquid?
-[Helen] Nice.

58:51.027 --> 58:53.029
-Liquid dill. You want some?
-No thanks.

58:53.112 --> 58:54.697
-Oh, you should try it.
-Taste it!

58:54.781 --> 58:55.657
-All right.
-Amazing.

58:55.740 --> 58:57.867
-I think you're going to like...
-[Max] Thank you.

58:57.951 --> 59:00.828
Daniel Boulud is in your kitchen,
giving you something, and you say "no"?

59:00.912 --> 59:01.996
-Okay.
-[Helen] It's good.

59:02.080 --> 59:03.540
[Phil] It's nice, right?

59:03.623 --> 59:04.541
What do you got there?

59:05.291 --> 59:08.253
Oh, this is my matzah ball recipe.

59:08.795 --> 59:11.381
I had a question because in my recipe

59:11.464 --> 59:13.508
it said that we put grated onion

59:13.591 --> 59:15.301
-in the matzah. Milk.
-Yeah.

59:15.385 --> 59:17.011
- Yeah.
- Some egg, some water.

59:17.095 --> 59:19.138
-Some chicken fat. The schmaltz.
-Right.

59:19.222 --> 59:21.266
But you don't put fat
inside the matzah balls?

59:21.349 --> 59:23.393
No. I take it out of the soup.

59:23.476 --> 59:26.646
But once I took it out of the soup,
I put it in the water.

59:26.729 --> 59:29.899
She freezes the soup
and then it's laying on top

59:29.983 --> 59:31.985
-so you just take it off.
-Yeah. Absolutely.

59:32.068 --> 59:34.362
One would think
you had something to do with it.

59:34.445 --> 59:35.947
-No.
-That's the thing he is watching.

59:36.030 --> 59:37.448
-I'm watching.
-You see? He is.

59:37.532 --> 59:39.325
-He say nothing, but he was watching.
-Right.

59:40.285 --> 59:44.163
I have to confess to you,
I use chicken bouillon too.

59:44.247 --> 59:46.874
Oh. Okay. Chicken, chicken.

59:46.958 --> 59:48.543
You made a double chicken stock.

59:48.626 --> 59:49.460
Yeah.

59:49.544 --> 59:53.756
I always make fun of her cooking.
I do it for a living really.

59:54.340 --> 59:57.802
But I have to say
that the matzah ball soup is...

59:57.885 --> 1:00:00.763
And now we have verification.

1:00:00.847 --> 1:00:02.557
I'm so glad we do.

1:00:02.640 --> 1:00:05.977
I would say this is
a four-star matzah ball soup.

1:00:06.936 --> 1:00:07.770
Bravo.

1:00:08.521 --> 1:00:09.397
Merci.

1:00:10.607 --> 1:00:12.525
[Max] Maybe it should be
on your menu, Daniel.

1:00:12.609 --> 1:00:13.985
-Helen's matzah ball soup?
-I will.

1:00:14.068 --> 1:00:16.404
Helen's matzah ball soup.
I will. I promise.

1:00:16.487 --> 1:00:17.572
[all laugh]

1:00:18.281 --> 1:00:19.324
[Dan] Mm.

1:00:19.407 --> 1:00:20.241
Look at this!

1:00:20.325 --> 1:00:22.410
-[Phil] Yeah.
-There's meat left over there.

1:00:22.493 --> 1:00:24.287
-[Phil] Yes.
-[Helen] Should've given you some.

1:00:25.622 --> 1:00:26.789
[Max] Wanna take some home?

1:00:29.334 --> 1:00:31.085
[Phil] Now you know
how much I love New York,

1:00:31.169 --> 1:00:33.421
its food, its culture, its attitude.

1:00:33.921 --> 1:00:35.089
But here's the thing:

1:00:35.173 --> 1:00:39.010
New York is New York because this is
where people came for a new life.

1:00:40.094 --> 1:00:43.389
My own parents had to come
through the Verrazano Narrows

1:00:43.473 --> 1:00:44.932
before the bridge was built...

1:00:45.475 --> 1:00:47.769
into New York Harbor,
past the Statue of Liberty.

1:00:48.895 --> 1:00:52.940
So it looms very large
in our collective memory

1:00:53.024 --> 1:00:55.360
of what it means to be an American,

1:00:55.443 --> 1:00:58.488
to have come from somewhere else
and to have settled here.

1:01:01.991 --> 1:01:03.242
For my birthday a few years ago,

1:01:03.326 --> 1:01:06.162
my wife bought me a bench here
in my favorite place.

1:01:09.749 --> 1:01:12.377
And then a few years later
when she hit that same birthday,

1:01:13.169 --> 1:01:14.587
I bought her the bench next door.

1:01:17.840 --> 1:01:21.803
So I'll always be grateful to New York

1:01:21.886 --> 1:01:24.097
for the life that I have.

1:01:25.932 --> 1:01:28.559
You got to be grateful to a place
that can do this to you.
