00:01.001 --> 00:03.617
("I Know What I Am"
by Band of Skulls playing)

00:03.670 --> 00:05.501
It's common decency.

00:05.547 --> 00:08.038
You want to file a police report,
you put on some pants.

00:08.091 --> 00:09.672
I mean, is that so much to ask?

00:09.718 --> 00:11.674
Ugh! Well, at least he 0--
he could've closed

00:11.720 --> 00:13.506
- his bathrobe or somethin'.
- Ugh.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.011
And, dude, that thing on his stomach?

00:15.057 --> 00:16.046
- What was that?
- I don't know.

00:16.099 --> 00:18.055
- A tattoo or--or a birthmark?

00:18.101 --> 00:19.716
|--| don't know.
I was trying not to look.

00:19.770 --> 00:22.477
You know, people gotta learn
to respect the uniform.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.683
- I mean, we're cops.
- Yeah.

00:23.732 --> 00:25.268
We got training.
We got vests.

00:25.317 --> 00:27.649
- Yeah. Hey, Dov?
- We got guns--

00:27.694 --> 00:29.525
Did you leave the squad running?

00:29.571 --> 00:32.187
J‘ But I know what I am,
they know what they are .l‘

00:32.241 --> 00:34.857
.l‘ So let me beJ‘

00:34.910 --> 00:37.026
- Hey!
- .l‘ But it's all right J‘

00:37.079 --> 00:38.444
.l‘ It's okay, I got... J‘

00:38.497 --> 00:40.533
Check the car! I got him!

00:40.582 --> 00:42.823
- J‘ It's all right... J‘
- Damn, he locked it!

00:42.876 --> 00:45.367
J‘ I got the time,
but the time don't pay .l‘

00:45.420 --> 00:47.752
J‘ It's all right, it's okay .l‘

00:47.798 --> 00:50.005
J‘ I got the time,
but the time don't pay .l‘

00:50.050 --> 00:53.338
J‘ It's all right, it's okay .l‘

00:53.387 --> 00:54.843
Stop! Police!

00:57.891 --> 00:58.880
Where'd he go?

01:03.564 --> 01:05.225
You gotta be kidding me.

01:05.274 --> 01:06.889
(Dov) I said don't move!

01:06.942 --> 01:08.648
(Chris) Seriously, man, come down!

01:10.404 --> 01:12.816
.l‘ I know what I am,
they know what they are .l‘

01:12.864 --> 01:15.355
.l‘ So let me be,
I know what I am... .l‘

01:15.409 --> 01:19.072
So... how do we call this one in?

01:19.121 --> 01:21.453
J‘ They know what they are,
so let me be J‘

01:21.498 --> 01:23.238
J‘ I know what I am .l‘

01:23.292 --> 01:25.032
(siren wailing in distance)

01:25.085 --> 01:27.371
.l‘ I know what I am,
they know what they are .l‘

01:27.421 --> 01:29.912
J‘ So let me be,
I know what I am .l‘

01:32.092 --> 01:34.504
.l‘ I know what I am,
they know what they are .l‘

01:34.553 --> 01:35.668
.l‘ So let me... J‘

01:39.933 --> 01:40.968
Dad?

01:47.482 --> 01:48.608
Hey.

01:52.529 --> 01:54.690
Dad?

02:02.956 --> 02:04.412
(sighs)

02:25.187 --> 02:28.850
(Chris, on recording) This is car 1505--
Well, not actually car 1505.

02:28.899 --> 02:30.810
Uh, Dispatch, this is Officer Diaz.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.565
I'm here with Officer Epstein.

02:32.611 --> 02:35.603
We're, uh... we're locked out
of the squad car.

02:35.656 --> 02:38.363
(woman on radio) Repeat, 1505.
Did you say, "Locked out"?

02:38.408 --> 02:41.491
Affirmative. Uh, we were
in pursuit of--we||, sort of--

02:41.536 --> 02:43.527
(Dov) No, no. No, don't.

02:43.580 --> 02:45.491
(Chris) Male, 6 feet,

02:45.540 --> 02:47.792
wearing, well, kind of dressed
like a superhero.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.793
(laughing) Not really
your finest moment, was it?

02:51.838 --> 02:53.794
I'm not playing this to embarrass you two,

02:53.840 --> 02:56.001
although that doesn't bother me much.

02:56.051 --> 02:58.087
I'm playing it to emphasize a point.

02:58.136 --> 03:01.173
Yeah, there's a reason your mittens
need string, Epstein.

03:01.223 --> 03:03.760
That, and that everyone makes mistakes.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.640
But we are not everyone.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.598
We're coppers,
held at a higher standard.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.808
Without the respect and trust
of the community,

03:10.857 --> 03:12.563
we can't do ourjobs.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.191
So that pretty much means...
Williams?

03:15.237 --> 03:17.944
(chair wheels roll)

03:18.407 --> 03:20.898
Don't leave your keys
in the car, dumb-ass.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.316
All right, let's get out there.

03:22.369 --> 03:25.076
Serve, protect,
and don't be a hero.

03:25.122 --> 03:29.115
(indistinct conversations)

03:29.167 --> 03:31.874
(Dov) Great.
We're officially those rookies.

03:31.920 --> 03:33.535
(laughing) Oh, what?
Now it's official?

03:34.131 --> 03:36.338
(laughs sarcastically)
Hilarious.

03:36.383 --> 03:38.669
So what? It was a simple mistake.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.210
We left the keys in the squad.

03:41.263 --> 03:44.721
Well, technically,
you left the keys in the squad car.

03:44.766 --> 03:45.755
Well, how were you guys
supposed to know

03:45.809 --> 03:47.015
that Batman wanted to borrow it?

03:47.060 --> 03:48.436
Yeah, doesn't he have his own car?

03:48.478 --> 03:49.934
(laughing)
That's what I thought.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.720
McNally, Interview One, now.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.766
Okay. I'll see you in a second.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.528
- Oh, hey! (laughs)
- (chuckles)

04:04.578 --> 04:05.738
(door closes)

04:07.247 --> 04:09.078
You left early this morning.

04:09.124 --> 04:12.082
Yeah, well, I had to drop some stuff off
at my dad's place.

04:12.127 --> 04:13.367
How is he?

04:13.420 --> 04:16.207
Good. He's the same.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.245
You know, why don't we, uh,

04:17.299 --> 04:18.709
why don't we take him out for dinner
this week?

04:18.759 --> 04:20.750
Sure.

04:20.802 --> 04:23.760
Yeah, let me just check and see,
uh, if he's free.

04:26.349 --> 04:29.841
Roster says that you're paired
with Swarek today.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.476
Since when do you check the roster?

04:31.521 --> 04:33.136
Eh, ljust want to know
who's got your back.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.270
(chuckles)

04:34.316 --> 04:35.931
Make sure you come home tonight.

04:36.485 --> 04:37.600
|wi||.

04:39.488 --> 04:40.648
Get outta here.

04:48.580 --> 04:50.116
(door closes)

04:52.083 --> 04:54.165
So you and Callaghan--

04:54.211 --> 04:55.997
back in the saddle, huh?

04:56.046 --> 04:58.253
- So to speak.
- Yep. We are.

04:59.966 --> 05:02.252
- Things are good?
- Things are good.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.803
So why the "but" face?

05:04.888 --> 05:06.219
What?

05:06.264 --> 05:08.255
Things are good with Callaghan, but...

05:08.308 --> 05:11.721
Uh... but I don't think he trusts me yet.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.761
- Why not?
- Oh, I don't know.

05:13.814 --> 05:16.305
Might have something to do
with the fact that I lied to him

05:16.358 --> 05:17.814
about what happened with us.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.645
You didn't lie. You just...

05:19.694 --> 05:21.980
didn't tell him the truth.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.191
Try that again?

05:24.241 --> 05:25.321
You were protecting him.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.904
| get that.
Some guys have fragile egos.

05:27.953 --> 05:28.942
Oh, but not you.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.327
Nope.

05:31.373 --> 05:32.829
So where are we headed?

05:32.874 --> 05:35.581
Memorial.
Gotta take a statement.

05:35.627 --> 05:37.037
Hmm. I didn't see that on the--

05:37.087 --> 05:40.921
It's not. It's a favor. Monica called.

05:40.966 --> 05:42.752
Monica? Really?

05:43.802 --> 05:44.791
Hmm.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.676
(police radio chatter)

05:46.721 --> 05:50.634
(indistinct conversations,
telephones ringing)

05:50.684 --> 05:53.141
Hey, Wonder Twins, get over here.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.178
Yeah, okay. All right. Give it to us.
We're ready.

05:56.231 --> 05:57.471
You know, believe or not,

05:57.524 --> 05:59.981
riding your backs
is not the only thing I live for,

06:00.026 --> 06:01.891
and neither is cleaning up your mess.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.233
This, uh...
the guy--"The Guardian"?

06:05.282 --> 06:06.271
He has a website?

06:06.324 --> 06:08.189
He has a website and a fan club.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.404
There's a whole underground
of real-life superheroes.

06:10.453 --> 06:12.034
But I can understand
why you couldn't catch him.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.787
Here, look here. You probablyjust
forgot to check his status update.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.870
"The Guardian is running from COPS:
hiding in alley."

06:19.379 --> 06:21.119
(sighs) We can catch him now.

06:21.172 --> 06:22.207
Now hold on.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.498
You guys got other things to deal with.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.667
Inventory check of your squad
just came back.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.176
Yeah, we checked.
Nothing was taken.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.007
Yeah, except for some info.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.796
Tech says that the computer
was accessed

06:31.850 --> 06:34.136
during the time
that your car was, um, what?

06:34.185 --> 06:35.220
Unaﬁended.

06:36.521 --> 06:37.977
That's what he was doing in there.

06:38.023 --> 06:41.356
Okay, and here is what
he was searching for.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.686
Shaun Hudson.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.522
He has four convictions for possession,

06:44.571 --> 06:46.027
two with intent to distribute.

06:46.072 --> 06:49.690
Uh, he's suspected of being
his, uh, neighborhood's main supply,

06:49.743 --> 06:51.950
but the Drug Squad
can't make anything stick.

06:51.995 --> 06:54.202
They have him listed
as "one to watch."

06:54.247 --> 06:56.989
So, apparently,
The Guardian is watching him, too.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.704
- So?
- So...

06:59.753 --> 07:02.210
Somebody needs to go
and warn Mr. Hudson here

07:02.255 --> 07:04.120
that because of their
bonehead mistake,

07:04.174 --> 07:07.587
he, uh, he may actually be
in danger from a known vigilante.

07:07.636 --> 07:09.172
We have to warn a drug dealer?

07:09.220 --> 07:12.178
Yeah, it's a crazy world, isn't it?
FYI, Epstein,

07:12.223 --> 07:15.010
these little pouches
on the sides of your pants--

07:15.060 --> 07:16.925
when, uh... you take
the keys out of the ignition,

07:16.978 --> 07:18.013
stick 'em in there.

07:22.275 --> 07:24.687
Her name's Tamara Kwan.
Came in a few hours ago.

07:24.736 --> 07:26.442
Cracked wrist, dislocated shoulder.

07:26.488 --> 07:27.819
She wouldn't say what happened,

07:27.864 --> 07:29.400
and she didn't want me to call anyone.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.438
Rape kit?

07:30.492 --> 07:32.153
Said she didn't need one, but...

07:32.202 --> 07:34.238
(sighs) this girl's scared.

07:34.287 --> 07:36.528
She's ready to be discharged,
but she doesn't seem to want to go.

07:36.581 --> 07:37.741
So she wants to talk?

07:38.792 --> 07:39.872
Thanks for coming.

07:41.252 --> 07:43.334
What makes you think
she's gonna talk to us?

07:44.130 --> 07:45.415
Somebody's hanging around,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.126
usually means they got
something to say.

07:48.176 --> 07:50.132
(Sam) So you'd been out
with some friends,

07:50.178 --> 07:51.588
and you were on your way home?

07:51.638 --> 07:54.846
Waiting for a bus
over at Brock and Dundas.

07:56.142 --> 07:58.758
It was really cold, and, uh...

07:58.812 --> 08:00.723
the bus was taking forever.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.103
Uh, the guy who offered you a ride--

08:02.148 --> 08:03.433
can you tell us what he looked like?

08:04.150 --> 08:06.106
Brown hair...

08:06.152 --> 08:08.768
a little older...

08:08.822 --> 08:10.608
but, like...

08:10.657 --> 08:13.273
really good-looking... (sighs)
and well-dressed,

08:13.326 --> 08:14.987
so I guess I trusted him.

08:15.036 --> 08:17.413
But he didn't take you straight home.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.197
He said that he wanted
to cut through Cedarvale Park...

08:20.250 --> 08:23.367
"because it was such a nice night."

08:23.420 --> 08:25.001
And, uh...

08:26.798 --> 08:29.210
next thing I know, we're pulled over.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.295
(crying)
And he's on top of me.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.801
And then I tried to--
I tried to fight him off,

08:33.847 --> 08:35.337
but I couldn't.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.302
And then I saw headlights.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.636
Another car pulled up?

08:39.686 --> 08:41.392
Then he kind of let go of me
for a second,

08:41.438 --> 08:45.022
so I opened the door, and I ran.
| just kept going.

08:45.066 --> 08:47.352
He has my purse and my wallet.

08:47.402 --> 08:49.313
(crying)
And even after I got away,

08:49.362 --> 08:51.353
I think that he tried to kill me.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.738
Why, he ran after you?

08:53.783 --> 08:57.367
As I took off, I heard gunshots.

09:09.674 --> 09:10.663
That's weird.

09:10.717 --> 09:11.797
That's the car.

09:12.719 --> 09:14.550
Why is it still here?

09:17.223 --> 09:19.214
Hey, I got Tamara's purse.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.053
You think the guyjust got spooked
by the other car

09:25.106 --> 09:26.141
and took off running?

09:27.150 --> 09:28.640
Somethin' like that.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.742
Didn't get very far.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.328
(police radio chatter)

09:50.381 --> 09:52.633
(siren wails)

09:52.675 --> 09:54.711
Duct tape, knife--

09:54.761 --> 09:56.672
looks like this guy
had a big night planned

09:56.721 --> 09:58.052
before he got shot.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.884
Tamara must've had
a guardian angel.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.048
You can say that again.

10:01.101 --> 10:04.059
Nice find.
Shot six times in the chest.

10:04.104 --> 10:06.720
- Looks to be a .38 or a 9.
- Six shots.

10:06.773 --> 10:08.309
- Mm-hmm.
- Somebody wanted him dead.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.019
You're pretty sure it wasn't
our girl in the hospital?

10:10.068 --> 10:11.604
I don't think so. I mean,

10:11.653 --> 10:14.235
she was pretty scared
that he'd be coming after her.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.360
Got an ID?

10:15.406 --> 10:18.443
Name is...
Kal-ci-ak, Trevor J.

10:18.493 --> 10:20.529
- Kaliciak? Can I see that?
- Yeah.

10:20.578 --> 10:21.988
You know him?

10:22.038 --> 10:24.324
Yeah, from five or six years ago.

10:24.374 --> 10:26.285
Suspect from one of your dad's old cases.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.323
My dad?

10:27.377 --> 10:28.537
Yeah. A rape and murder.

10:28.586 --> 10:29.746
You know, Andy,
maybe we can call your dad,

10:29.796 --> 10:30.876
see if he can help us out.

10:30.922 --> 10:34.039
Yeah, Luke, |--| really don't think
that today's a very good day to--

10:34.092 --> 10:35.298
I mean, if he's worked Kaliciak before,

10:35.343 --> 10:36.799
he can help us put together
a line of suspects.

10:38.096 --> 10:39.302
Yeah. Um...

10:39.347 --> 10:41.633
Uh, McNally and I
can head over there right now,

10:41.683 --> 10:44.516
talk to him, see if he can
give us any leads, yeah?

10:45.562 --> 10:48.099
That'd be great. Let me know
if he comes up with anything relevant.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.183
(Sam) You got it.

10:52.485 --> 10:53.861
Thank you.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.322
When we tell this guy,
he's gonna be ticked.

11:03.371 --> 11:04.451
You think he'll try something?

11:04.497 --> 11:05.828
Pfft, let's hope.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.739
Chris, we're cops.

11:07.792 --> 11:09.874
All we gotta do is
square our shoulders,

11:09.919 --> 11:13.207
look Hudson straight in the eyes
and apologize.

11:13.673 --> 11:14.662
This is ridiculous.

11:14.716 --> 11:16.047
I mean, can't wejust arrest him,

11:16.092 --> 11:17.423
you know, for, like,
being a drug dealer?

11:17.468 --> 11:19.754
Oh, yes, that's a great idea.

11:19.804 --> 11:20.964
Right? 'Cause we'll probably get there

11:21.014 --> 11:22.879
right when he's handing
a bag of drugs to a buyer.

11:22.932 --> 11:25.344
Hey, maybe he'll even stop
and wait for us to take a picture.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.508
Hey, we're on the same team here.

11:26.561 --> 11:30.429
I know. I'm sorry. lt'sjust...
we're about to go apologize

11:30.481 --> 11:33.018
to some scumbag drug dealer
we can't put behind bars

11:33.067 --> 11:35.274
the day after we get locked out
of our own squad car,

11:35.320 --> 11:36.355
all because some--

11:36.404 --> 11:38.269
You've gotta be kidding me.

11:39.657 --> 11:42.319
Okay, give me two.
Then come at him from the west side,

11:42.368 --> 11:43.869
but be careful.
You saw him last night.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.198
Who knows what kind
of psychopath's under that mask?

11:46.247 --> 11:47.327
Okay.

11:54.464 --> 11:56.955
Hey, police! Don't move!

11:59.177 --> 12:00.508
Whoa, jeez.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.188
Police! Don't move!

12:17.111 --> 12:18.487
I said police!

12:20.240 --> 12:22.231
(panting)

12:25.870 --> 12:27.610
Look, don't expect much.

12:27.664 --> 12:30.246
Pretty sure my dad
was on a bender last night.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.993
Still can't get him
to work a program, huh?

12:34.045 --> 12:35.785
You know my dad.
He's an ex-cop.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.920
"Programs are for victims."

12:37.966 --> 12:39.706
Yep.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.750
Is that--

12:41.803 --> 12:43.088
Huh.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.054
Dad?

12:48.434 --> 12:50.595
- Dad?
- Andy?

12:50.645 --> 12:52.727
Oh, my God. What happened?

12:54.482 --> 12:56.063
I don't know.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.019
(groans)

13:01.072 --> 13:03.779
(indistinct conversations,
telephone rings)

13:05.285 --> 13:08.869
Okay, please tell me you didn't
get any of that on my stuff.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.074
Well, actually, a disgruntled citizen

13:11.124 --> 13:12.989
accidentally spilled her coffee.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.703
But nice of you to finallyjoin me.

13:15.086 --> 13:16.451
I had a meeting with Frank.

13:16.504 --> 13:17.744
Don't you mean
Staff Sergeant Best?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.537
Or I guess that doesn't apply to you?

13:19.590 --> 13:22.582
You know, for someone
sleeping with a detective,

13:22.635 --> 13:23.920
you might want to reconsider

13:23.970 --> 13:26.052
who's exactly getting
the favors around here.

13:26.097 --> 13:31.558
Gail, if I was seeing Detective Barber
for preferential treatment,

13:31.602 --> 13:34.639
you think I'd choose
to be partnered with you?

13:41.487 --> 13:42.897
Dad, can you tell us
what happened?

13:42.947 --> 13:45.984
(sighs) |--|--| don't remember.

13:46.034 --> 13:49.697
Well, it looks like
you probably got into a fight...

13:49.746 --> 13:51.407
but I think that all of this
is your own blood.

13:51.456 --> 13:52.741
(grunts)

13:52.790 --> 13:55.782
Tommy, uh, what are you doing
with this--Kaliciak's file?

13:55.835 --> 13:58.247
Guy's out.
He was paroled two weeks ago.

14:00.089 --> 14:02.501
Uh, current address, work number?

14:02.550 --> 14:03.665
- You been following him?
- Heh.

14:03.718 --> 14:05.674
Somebody has to.

14:05.720 --> 14:08.211
I talked to his PO,
his boss, his wife.

14:08.264 --> 14:10.255
Nobody wants to believe
this guy's still a problem.

14:10.308 --> 14:13.141
Dad... Kaliciak's dead.

14:14.270 --> 14:17.433
(Sam) Someone put six rounds in him
last night out in Cedarvale Park.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.269
Were you on Kaliciak last night?

14:20.943 --> 14:23.901
Yeah. At the Wellstone.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.606
|--| sat on the place for a while.

14:28.826 --> 14:29.815
I had a few.

14:29.869 --> 14:32.326
Did you, uh, talk to him last night?

14:32.372 --> 14:33.828
Did you follow him anywhere else?

14:34.374 --> 14:36.740
I don't know.
I must've blacked out.

14:36.793 --> 14:39.705
|--| just woke up an hour ago
in my car in the alley.

14:39.754 --> 14:41.164
Is the coat you wore, Tommy?

14:41.714 --> 14:42.749
Yeah.

14:51.641 --> 14:53.757
(sniffs and exhales)

14:53.810 --> 14:55.141
It's been fired recently.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.935
Okay, Tommy, I want you
to take that shirt off,

15:05.988 --> 15:07.853
hang it up and don't touch it.
Where's your lockbox?

15:07.907 --> 15:09.192
- lt--lt's over there.
- Where's the key?

15:09.242 --> 15:11.528
Underneath the Bible
in the nightstand drawer.

15:12.745 --> 15:14.861
Okay, just try to get
a little bit of sleep, okay?

15:14.914 --> 15:16.529
Maybe it'll come back to you
in a couple of hours.

15:16.582 --> 15:18.994
But if you remember anything,
you've got to call me.

15:21.629 --> 15:23.165
Tommy, I'm keeping the key.

15:23.214 --> 15:25.079
In the meantime,
don't answer the phone.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.669
Don't talk to anyone.

15:26.717 --> 15:27.752
Okay.

15:30.596 --> 15:34.180
We're gonna sort this out,
Dad, okay? I promise.

15:35.226 --> 15:38.218
(siren wailing in distance)

15:48.114 --> 15:49.524
What are we gonna do?

15:50.700 --> 15:53.817
Well, what we're not gonna do
is jump to conclusions, okay?

15:53.870 --> 15:57.203
All we know for sure
is that your dad was drinking last night

15:57.248 --> 15:58.454
and tailing Kaliciak.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.911
And that he fired his .38.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.496
So we'll piece together his night,

16:02.545 --> 16:06.037
figure out what really happened
and go from there.

16:06.090 --> 16:07.296
Okay?

16:09.510 --> 16:10.886
(starts engine)

16:17.977 --> 16:23.643
(police radio chatter)

16:23.691 --> 16:27.058
Officers, please,
there's no need for this.

16:27.111 --> 16:28.612
Look, I didn't do anything.

16:28.654 --> 16:29.860
Attempt break and enter?

16:29.906 --> 16:31.988
Unlawful use of a police computer?
Resisting arrest?

16:32.033 --> 16:33.148
Let's just take him straight into a cell.

16:33.201 --> 16:34.316
- But, guys--
- I'll do the processing

16:34.368 --> 16:35.869
from the report room.
Then we question him

16:35.912 --> 16:36.992
- about Hudson.
- Look, I'm sorry.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.153
Nobody needs to see a thing.
Shut up.

16:38.206 --> 16:40.447
(door beeps, buzzes)

16:40.500 --> 16:42.991
Okay, okay. This is what they call
an instant classic.

16:43.044 --> 16:44.750
- (man) Nice.
- Okay, hold up, hold up.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.205
- Ohh!
- There.

16:46.255 --> 16:47.540
That's the division Christmas card.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.296
(laughs) All right,
so what do they call him, boys?

16:49.342 --> 16:50.798
Is it Night Commander...?

16:50.843 --> 16:51.878
It's "The Guardian."

16:51.928 --> 16:53.509
- Come on.
- Oh, no.

16:53.554 --> 16:54.543
- Okay, hold on.
- Sweet.

16:54.597 --> 16:56.633
Hey, Epstein. Epstein!

16:56.682 --> 16:59.389
Sorry, officers.
We're not open for another hour.

16:59.435 --> 17:01.266
And, uh, between you and me,

17:01.312 --> 17:04.099
the lunch burger is not as good
as everyone says it is.

17:04.148 --> 17:05.934
Oh, thanks. We're not hungry.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.644
Did you see an older guy
come in here last night--

17:07.693 --> 17:09.354
uh, late 50s, kind of big?

17:09.403 --> 17:10.859
You'll have to do better than that.

17:11.405 --> 17:12.440
All right.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.360
How about this guy?

17:16.494 --> 17:20.658
Yeah. Had to mop his blood off my floor
after I kicked him out.

17:20.706 --> 17:22.287
You kicked him out? Why?

17:22.333 --> 17:23.948
Ah, he was going off on some guy--

17:24.001 --> 17:27.118
got in his face, took a swing,
so the other guy popped him,

17:27.171 --> 17:28.672
busted his nose, and I don't know.

17:28.714 --> 17:30.830
|--| figured it was
somebody's pissed-off father.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.874
All right, thanks.
(clears throat)

17:35.680 --> 17:38.717
(Andy) Okay, so he got into a fight.

17:38.766 --> 17:39.846
Doesn't prove anything.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.134
Andy, I'm afraid we gotta consider
the possibility of what came next.

17:43.187 --> 17:45.519
Kaliciak thinks he's lost your dad.

17:45.565 --> 17:47.851
Then opportunity knocks
with Tamara at the bus stop.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.016
But your dad's still on him,
knows what's gonna happen,

17:50.069 --> 17:52.060
- so he tails him to the park.
- No.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.445
If that's what happened,
he probably saved that girl's life.

17:54.490 --> 17:55.605
No, Sam.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.068
There's gotta be another explanation.

17:57.118 --> 17:58.403
Andy, he fired his .38.

17:58.452 --> 18:01.364
(sighs) Okay,
so my dad was drinking,

18:01.414 --> 18:04.622
and he confronts this guy.
They get into a huge fight.

18:04.667 --> 18:06.874
The guy breaks his nose,
so he goes off to his car,

18:06.919 --> 18:10.332
and he's really pissed off,
so he...

18:10.381 --> 18:11.666
he goes to the beach.

18:11.716 --> 18:12.751
The beach?

18:12.800 --> 18:14.415
Yeah. When my dad gets this way,

18:14.468 --> 18:15.878
sometimes he drives out
to the west beach

18:15.928 --> 18:18.670
and goes past the breakwall
and fires off rounds.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.891
No, just listen, okay?
Maybe he went there last night.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.472
Maybe that's where
he fired his gun.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.308
Okay, okay, sure. The beach.

18:28.357 --> 18:30.473
Why not? Let's do it.

18:32.236 --> 18:35.103
The Guardian. Crime-fighter.
Identity unknown.

18:35.156 --> 18:37.397
(laughs) Gail, did you see this?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.111
Yeah, it's hilarious.

18:39.160 --> 18:41.776
(telephone ringing in distance,
camera shutter clicks)

18:43.581 --> 18:45.037
(Noelle) Oh, you gotta see this.
This is...

18:45.082 --> 18:48.290
I'm surprised. Normally,
you like other people's misery.

18:48.336 --> 18:49.451
I know.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.954
It's just I have a--
a lot on my mind, all right?

18:55.718 --> 18:59.677
It's this stupid Municipal Merit Awards
banquet tonight.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.303
Is that what your meeting
with Sarge was about?

19:01.349 --> 19:02.429
You're getting a Merit award?

19:02.475 --> 19:03.840
No, it's for my mother.

19:03.893 --> 19:05.258
It's a lifetime achievement award.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.474
Oh. Way to go,
Superintendent Peck.

19:08.522 --> 19:10.649
Yeah, except for l have to introduce her.

19:10.691 --> 19:11.897
So?

19:11.942 --> 19:15.150
You remember when I gave
my exit presentation at the academy?

19:15.196 --> 19:17.687
Um, no.

19:17.740 --> 19:20.231
That's because I was sick.

19:20.284 --> 19:23.526
Like, pretty much every time
l have to talk in public,

19:23.579 --> 19:26.036
the idea ofjust getting up there...

19:26.082 --> 19:29.415
| get all pale and sweaty.

19:30.878 --> 19:32.493
Okay, fine, just sweaty.

19:32.546 --> 19:34.332
You know, please forget
I told you about it.

19:37.927 --> 19:39.633
Oh, hi. Can I help you, ma'am?

19:39.679 --> 19:41.761
I got a message when I got to work.

19:41.806 --> 19:44.138
A Detective Callaghan
was trying to reach me?

19:44.183 --> 19:45.343
Can I get your name?

19:45.393 --> 19:46.849
Valerie Kaliciak.

19:46.894 --> 19:49.135
Uh, okay. Just one moment.

19:54.360 --> 19:56.897
(door beeps)
Terrence Porter.

19:56.946 --> 19:59.779
194 Fielding.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.815
Two years less a day
for armed robbery.

20:01.867 --> 20:03.983
Turns out our Guardian's
not such a hero after all.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.413
You know, breaking into a squad car's
a serious offense.

20:06.455 --> 20:08.161
It was open. I needed the info.

20:08.207 --> 20:09.538
You make this whole thing
yourself?

20:09.583 --> 20:12.120
Most of it.
Ordered some of the stuff online.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.500
It's kinda cool. Heh.

20:15.506 --> 20:17.167
What were you doing
at Hudson's apartment?

20:17.216 --> 20:19.753
l was looking for something concrete
so you guys could put him away.

20:21.095 --> 20:23.507
Hudson has stash houses
all over the neighborhood.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.343
Okay, he's using kids as young
as 9 and 10 years old as runners.

20:26.392 --> 20:28.599
I mean, you guys still haven't
been able to shut him down.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.384
So what--
The Guardian's gonna do it?

20:30.438 --> 20:31.769
Well, you guys can't touch him.

20:31.814 --> 20:36.057
You have to worry about unlawful searches
and harassment complaints.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.943
I'm just trying to clean up
the streets like you.

20:39.989 --> 20:42.196
Difference is we follow the law,

20:42.241 --> 20:44.402
and we don't put on a costume to do it.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.360
Uh, actually...

20:47.413 --> 20:48.744
Dov, we kind of do.

20:50.458 --> 20:52.244
But our costumes are official.

20:52.293 --> 20:53.578
We're trained professionals.

20:53.627 --> 20:55.413
You're not.

20:58.424 --> 21:01.040
Again, Mrs. Kaliciak, I'm very sorry.

21:02.762 --> 21:05.174
He's only been back for two weeks.

21:06.474 --> 21:08.840
Do you have any idea where he
might've been heading last night?

21:10.436 --> 21:14.349
No. Trevor and I hadn't really
fallen back into a routine yet.

21:18.068 --> 21:20.275
That's the girl
from my husband's case...

21:21.781 --> 21:23.066
Tina Walters.

21:23.115 --> 21:25.492
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have left those out.

21:25.534 --> 21:29.493
The officer told me what he did,
but seeing it...

21:31.248 --> 21:32.704
l-l'm sorry. What officer?

21:34.168 --> 21:35.374
I didn't get his name.

21:35.920 --> 21:38.457
He came to see me a few weeks
before Trevor got released,

21:39.173 --> 21:40.788
said I shouldn't trust him.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.467
I guess he was right.

21:54.146 --> 21:56.762
Your dad's a good shot,
even when he's loaded.

21:56.816 --> 21:58.681
(seagulls calling)
Thanks.

21:58.734 --> 22:00.850
Remind me not to call you
as a character witness

22:00.903 --> 22:02.313
when he's on trial for his life.

22:04.406 --> 22:06.237
Andy, we've been here
half an hour, okay?

22:06.283 --> 22:08.274
We gotta get back to the barn,
see if they made any progress.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.818
No. I know. Just a couple
more minutes, Sam. Please.

22:10.871 --> 22:14.739
Look, Andy,
even if we find some shells,

22:14.792 --> 22:16.828
there's no way to prove
when they were fired,

22:16.877 --> 22:18.458
last night or last week.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.335
I know my dad is a drunk.

22:20.381 --> 22:22.337
Okay? I know he's messed up.

22:22.383 --> 22:25.875
He's not gonna throw his entire life away
on some random ex-con.

22:25.928 --> 22:29.420
Kaliciak's not just any ex-con,
okay? Listen to me.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.930
About six years ago,
when your dad was working Homicide,

22:31.976 --> 22:34.763
they found this girl--
Tina Walters. Remember her?

22:34.812 --> 22:37.144
18, dumped in an industrial park?

22:37.189 --> 22:38.178
That was Kaliciak?

22:38.232 --> 22:39.267
ME figured she'd been killed

22:39.316 --> 22:40.977
only a few hours
before they found the body,

22:41.026 --> 22:44.109
but he held her captive
for almost a week.

22:44.154 --> 22:46.145
I wasn't working the case myself,

22:46.198 --> 22:48.314
but I remember your dad
sat for a long time

22:48.367 --> 22:51.450
with the girl's mother--
single mom.

22:51.495 --> 22:54.407
Tina was an only child.
I guess your dad could relate.

22:55.291 --> 22:57.657
Yeah, well, he caught him.

22:57.710 --> 22:59.200
Yeah, he caught him.

23:00.880 --> 23:03.622
Figured he was responsible
for at least three other girls.

23:03.674 --> 23:07.041
He caught him,
but the case had some holes.

23:11.140 --> 23:13.051
Tommy was not in top form.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.095
He blew it.

23:21.650 --> 23:23.026
Prosecutors had to cut a deal--

23:23.068 --> 23:25.730
a few years on a weapons charge
for some guns they found,

23:25.779 --> 23:27.280
but he walked on the rape and murder.

23:28.365 --> 23:31.198
I doubt your dad ever forgave himself...

23:31.243 --> 23:32.744
or Kaliciak.

23:38.792 --> 23:40.828
We should bring my dad's gun in
and get it tested by Ballistics.

23:40.878 --> 23:42.493
- Andy--
- No. lfthe gun

23:42.546 --> 23:43.922
doesn't match the slugs
in Kaliciak,

23:43.964 --> 23:45.340
then we know he didn't do it.

23:45.382 --> 23:47.338
It's not that simple.
If we get Ballistics involved,

23:47.384 --> 23:49.170
your dad's officially a murder suspect.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.210
Even if he's cleared, it doesn't matter.

23:51.263 --> 23:52.719
All the great work he did as a cop,

23:52.765 --> 23:54.881
the years of service,
it comes apart.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.300
Sam, listen, I really appreciate
you trying to protect him.

23:57.353 --> 23:59.184
lt's notjust your dad
I'm looking out for.

23:59.229 --> 24:00.730
lf Tommy becomes a suspect,

24:00.773 --> 24:03.389
no matter how good you are,
how straight,

24:03.442 --> 24:06.650
it's gonna stick to you,
and you don't deserve that.

24:07.404 --> 24:09.565
Are you saying
we should cover this up?

24:09.615 --> 24:12.277
I'm saying we exhaust
all other options, okay?

24:12.326 --> 24:13.361
We head back to the barn

24:13.410 --> 24:16.493
and try to find anyone else
with motive and opportunity.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.153
Meantime, we keep Callaghan

24:18.207 --> 24:20.323
as far away from your father as possible.

24:22.086 --> 24:24.042
(siren walls in distance)

24:26.173 --> 24:29.210
(stiffly) "Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

24:29.259 --> 24:31.295
- Most of you know..."
- (mouths words)

24:31.345 --> 24:32.676
"Superinte--"

24:32.721 --> 24:34.052
(normal voice) Can you stop
mouthing my words, please?

24:34.098 --> 24:36.805
Do you want the help? Go.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.306
(sighs)

24:38.352 --> 24:41.970
(stiffly) "Most of you know, uh, Elaine Peck

24:42.022 --> 24:43.558
"as Superintendent Peck.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.723
But I call her something else."

24:45.776 --> 24:47.732
(normal voice)
Can you forget it, please?

24:47.778 --> 24:49.063
I am sweating already!

24:49.113 --> 24:51.399
Gail, nobody's gonna laugh at you.
I promise.

24:51.448 --> 24:53.404
That's really not
what I'm worried about.

24:53.450 --> 24:55.736
Look, l have certain standards
for myself,

24:55.786 --> 24:56.946
and I expect nothing but the best,

24:56.996 --> 24:58.827
but my mother expects more.

24:58.872 --> 25:01.830
Look, growing up, she gave me
three pieces of advice:

25:01.875 --> 25:03.661
always remember who you are,

25:04.420 --> 25:05.910
work harder than everyone else,

25:05.963 --> 25:07.078
and don't screw up.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.042
I'm gonna screw up.

25:13.095 --> 25:17.088
We got high-density padding,
reinforced spine

25:17.141 --> 25:18.802
and a dual-phase kidney belt.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.216
- Nice.
- Yeah.

25:20.269 --> 25:23.432
I know it sounds stupid,
but when I put this suit on,

25:23.480 --> 25:24.811
I kind of feel like I can do anything.

25:24.857 --> 25:26.472
Like run from the cops?

25:26.525 --> 25:29.312
(sighs) Okay.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.226
I guess I didn't want to go back tojail.

25:31.280 --> 25:32.770
Well, you shouldn't be screwing around,
trying to do our job.

25:32.823 --> 25:36.065
Look, ever since I was a kid,
I wanted to be a cop.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.484
Okay, man, look at you guys--
the new boots,

25:38.537 --> 25:40.448
the bulletproof vest.

25:40.497 --> 25:42.954
You're cops.
Everybody respects you.

25:43.000 --> 25:46.367
I never had that,
not my whole life.

25:46.420 --> 25:47.705
So why not go to the academy?

25:49.631 --> 25:50.757
Bad choice of friends.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.169
You know, I never even knew
what was going down.

25:53.218 --> 25:57.211
Look, it doesn't matter.
I was with them. I screwed up.

25:57.264 --> 25:58.424
And no one will let you forget it.

26:00.893 --> 26:02.554
What are these pockets for,
weapons?

26:02.603 --> 26:04.844
No. I don't carry weapons.

26:04.897 --> 26:07.138
Th-They're for camera lenses.

26:07.191 --> 26:09.398
Look, most of what I do
is nighttime surveillance--

26:09.443 --> 26:11.855
you know, hang back
and keep an eye out.

26:11.904 --> 26:14.190
Kind of sounds like being a rookie.
(chuckles)

26:14.239 --> 26:17.231
These stash houses
you say Hudson's got--

26:17.284 --> 26:18.273
any pictures?

26:18.327 --> 26:20.989
Tons--Hudson, his crew.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.279
- Where are they?
- Back at my place.

26:25.501 --> 26:27.742
Come on, Terry.
Let's go for a ride.

26:30.005 --> 26:31.745
- (Dov) Get your stuff.
- (Chris) Nice.

26:32.341 --> 26:33.797
Hey, Dad, uh, it's me again.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.833
Just give me a call
when you get this, okay?

26:35.886 --> 26:37.046
(lowers voice)
Probablyjust sleeping it off.

26:37.096 --> 26:38.211
- Yeah.
- Hey.

26:38.263 --> 26:40.970
Hey. Um,
how's the investigation going?

26:41.016 --> 26:42.881
Uh, turns out Kaliciak
just got out of Quinnley,

26:42.935 --> 26:45.221
paroled two weeks ago,
so I'm calling in his PO

26:45.270 --> 26:46.885
to see if he knows anything.

26:46.939 --> 26:49.601
What about your dad?
Has he had any insights on the case?

26:49.650 --> 26:53.939
Uh, no, not really. He doesn't
remember much about the case.

26:53.987 --> 26:57.320
He'll keep trying, though.
You got a suspect?

26:58.408 --> 27:00.273
No. That's, uh, Kaliciak's wife.

27:00.327 --> 27:02.283
I finished with her a while ago,
but she's still here.

27:03.038 --> 27:04.824
- She give you anything?
- No, not this time.

27:04.873 --> 27:06.033
I'm gonna have to bring her back.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.664
I can give her a lift home if you want.

27:07.709 --> 27:08.915
Andy!

27:08.961 --> 27:10.121
Dad.

27:12.339 --> 27:13.624
What are you doing here?

27:15.676 --> 27:16.961
I'm here to help.

27:24.685 --> 27:26.926
l have been trying
to get ahold of you.

27:26.979 --> 27:29.436
Did you remember something?
I mean, what are you doing here?

27:29.481 --> 27:32.143
Just trying to help
my little girl figure this out.

27:32.943 --> 27:35.559
You've been drinking.
How much have you had?

27:35.612 --> 27:39.025
(chuckles) Look, uh,
l'm--l'm all right.

27:39.074 --> 27:40.735
You can't do this right now.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.695
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

27:42.744 --> 27:44.120
(Luke) Tommy,
I'm surprised to see you.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.495
Andy said you didn't remember much
about the Kaliciak case.

27:46.540 --> 27:48.371
Eh, you know.

27:48.417 --> 27:52.376
These days, it takes a little time
for a memory to warm up.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.878
You sure you're all right?
That doesn't look too good.

27:54.923 --> 27:57.414
Just had a little disagreement
with a guy.

27:57.467 --> 28:00.174
Yeah. Now you know why I didn't have
very many dates in high school.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.462
I thought we could start
with the Tina Walters case.

28:03.515 --> 28:06.632
It's a little before my time,
so if you don't mind thinking back,

28:06.685 --> 28:08.846
see if you can remember anyone
who might still hold a grudge.

28:09.605 --> 28:11.061
I'll try my best.

28:20.407 --> 28:23.069
I saw the pictures of Tina Walters.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.490
My husband really did
those things to her, didn't he?

28:30.375 --> 28:32.036
Please, I need to know.

28:32.085 --> 28:33.871
Yes, he did.

28:33.921 --> 28:35.502
The case fell apart,

28:35.547 --> 28:38.038
but I tell you for a fact,
your husband was guilty.

28:38.091 --> 28:40.047
And last night,
he tried to do it again.

28:40.886 --> 28:42.717
You think they'll catch who killed him?

28:43.639 --> 28:44.719
We hope so.

28:45.432 --> 28:48.390
You never know. Sometimes people
feel better when they confess.

28:52.397 --> 28:56.185
Kaliciak did time.
Probably didn't make any friends.

28:56.235 --> 28:58.476
So maybe we're looking at another con.

28:58.528 --> 29:00.268
Or maybe it was just
wrong place, wrong time.

29:00.322 --> 29:02.278
Way he was shot says it's personal.

29:02.324 --> 29:04.815
He hurt a lot of people.
There were other girls,

29:04.868 --> 29:06.244
their--their families.

29:06.286 --> 29:07.275
Well, you interviewed most of 'em.

29:07.329 --> 29:08.535
You think anyone is capable of this?

29:08.580 --> 29:09.956
Callaghan, these people
have suffered enough.

29:09.998 --> 29:11.454
Yeah, but if one of them did this--

29:11.500 --> 29:13.081
Then good for them!

29:19.132 --> 29:23.546
Look, Kaliciak didn't
just attack these girls.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.302
He left a lot of collateral damage.

29:29.059 --> 29:31.550
When Trevor was arrested six years ago,

29:31.603 --> 29:33.309
I knew it was a mistake.

29:33.355 --> 29:35.437
He was my husband.
We slept in the same bed.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.189
There was no way he could do
those terrible things.

29:38.235 --> 29:39.600
But you weren't sure?

29:39.653 --> 29:41.268
I trusted him.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.989
But every time I turned around,
l was lying for him...

29:46.034 --> 29:47.774
looking the other way...

29:49.246 --> 29:51.453
giving him an alibi.

29:51.498 --> 29:54.080
Well, of course.
You were taking care of him.

29:54.126 --> 29:57.618
Clean up someone's mess
long enough, it becomes automatic.

29:57.671 --> 30:00.913
But people like that,
they don't change.

30:00.966 --> 30:04.299
They keep doing it again and again
until they get caught.

30:04.344 --> 30:06.585
Or someone stops him.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.676
Dad, you know, maybe we
shouldn't do this right now.

30:13.729 --> 30:15.390
You can come back later.

30:15.439 --> 30:19.978
No. Detective Callaghan
needs to see this case clearly,

30:20.027 --> 30:21.983
and I'm gonna help him.

30:22.029 --> 30:24.645
How closely did you look at this file?

30:24.698 --> 30:27.110
| just flipped through it.
It's only been a couple hours.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.148
You see the cage?

30:28.201 --> 30:29.452
The cage?

30:31.288 --> 30:33.950
Where he kept Tina in the basement

30:33.999 --> 30:36.490
for a whole week... in that filth.

30:40.047 --> 30:41.457
You know, maybe Andy's right.
Maybe we should--

30:41.506 --> 30:43.883
And then he just strangles her
and throws her body out

30:43.925 --> 30:46.837
behind a garbage bin,
and he was gonna do it again.

30:50.057 --> 30:52.799
Tommy, did you talk to Kaliciak's wife
a couple weeks ago?

30:52.851 --> 30:54.762
Kaliciak was a predator.

30:54.811 --> 30:56.517
You knew he was getting out.
You tracked him.

30:58.065 --> 31:00.932
It was the only way
I could keep them safe.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.440
I mean, all this evidence, right,

31:02.486 --> 31:03.896
the pictures, fingerprints--
it didn't matter.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.151
He did barely any time.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.313
He was gonna get out
and do it all over again.

31:07.366 --> 31:10.028
- Kaliciak deserved what he got!
- Dad.

31:15.165 --> 31:17.952
Look... (sighs)

31:18.001 --> 31:21.164
from one detective to another,
Callaghan,

31:21.213 --> 31:22.874
this case...

31:22.923 --> 31:24.914
maybe you don't have to try so hard.

31:25.550 --> 31:28.212
Mr. McNally, I really don't think
you should say anything else.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.718
All right. You need to get
your father sobered up

31:37.771 --> 31:39.181
and get him a lawyer right now.

31:39.231 --> 31:41.187
I know. I know I should've
never let him say anything.

31:41.233 --> 31:42.689
I mean, both Sam and I said
that he needed

31:42.734 --> 31:43.940
- to just go and--
- Wait. l-l'm sorry.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.145
You and Sam knew about this?

31:45.195 --> 31:46.275
Well--

31:46.321 --> 31:48.733
Andy, come on.
What else are you not telling me?

31:48.782 --> 31:50.522
Luke, I am so sorry.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.612
You know what? It's probably best
you don't say anything else, either.

31:55.747 --> 31:56.736
(slams wall)

31:57.666 --> 31:58.826
(Sam) McNally?

31:59.251 --> 32:02.288
Sam, Luke knows...
about my dad.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.326
He didn't do it.

32:03.380 --> 32:04.415
What?

32:04.464 --> 32:06.329
Kaliciak's wife, she just confessed.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.175
So you became suspicious,

32:14.224 --> 32:16.886
and that's when you began
to follow your husband?

32:16.935 --> 32:20.723
When I saw him pick up that girl
at the bus stop,

32:20.772 --> 32:22.683
I didn't want to believe it.

32:23.775 --> 32:25.390
I mean, I loved him,

32:25.444 --> 32:28.231
but I had to do something.
He was never going to stop.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.191
(door opens)

32:30.240 --> 32:31.400
(presses key)

32:33.785 --> 32:35.321
Uh... (sighs)

32:35.370 --> 32:38.157
traffic camera on the Kingsway
recorded your dad's car

32:38.206 --> 32:40.197
heading out to the west beach
around midnight,

32:40.250 --> 32:42.707
then back again a few hours later.

32:42.752 --> 32:46.836
So he wasn't anywhere near the park
when Kaliciak was shot.

32:46.882 --> 32:49.214
No. You were right.

32:49.259 --> 32:50.339
(sighs)

32:51.386 --> 32:52.796
So...

32:52.846 --> 32:55.178
you okay to take him home now?

32:59.895 --> 33:01.135
(whispers) Thank you.

33:16.661 --> 33:17.946
(exhales deeply)

33:17.996 --> 33:21.238
(sirens wailing in distance)

33:21.291 --> 33:24.533
(Tommy) That was a close one,
huh, sweetie? (chuckles)

33:24.586 --> 33:26.622
(sighs)

33:26.671 --> 33:27.922
You okay?

33:27.964 --> 33:30.455
You haven't said anything
since we left the barn.

33:32.928 --> 33:35.385
I can't do this anymore--

33:36.306 --> 33:37.295
clean up after you.

33:37.891 --> 33:41.429
- Andy.
- No. No, I hate it, okay?

33:41.478 --> 33:44.970
|--| hate this sick feeling that | get
in the pit of my stomach

33:45.023 --> 33:47.480
every time the phone rings
and it's you.

33:47.526 --> 33:49.858
And I wonder, "What the hell's
happened this time?"

33:49.903 --> 33:51.313
|--| won't call.

33:51.363 --> 33:55.322
Yes, you will. You always do,
because I'm all you have.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.153
(stammers)
You're my little girl.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.408
| used to be.

33:59.037 --> 34:01.574
| used to be the little girl
that you could hold in your arms,

34:01.623 --> 34:04.410
the one that you would take to the beach
and look for seashells.

34:04.459 --> 34:07.576
I went to the same beach
looking for bullets--

34:07.629 --> 34:11.121
bullets--trying to prove that you
didn't do something terrible.

34:11.883 --> 34:15.467
l was hoping that all you did
was get blasted

34:15.512 --> 34:19.300
and drive to the water
and shoot your gun.

34:20.809 --> 34:22.470
How twisted is that?

34:25.063 --> 34:26.928
Augh, this is all my fault.

34:26.982 --> 34:28.518
- No, Andy, no--
- Yeah. Yeah, it's my fault,

34:28.567 --> 34:31.525
because I've somehow convinced myself
that this is normal, okay,

34:31.570 --> 34:36.530
that you needing me like this
makes us close or something.

34:36.575 --> 34:39.237
I actually believed
you killed somebody today.

34:41.997 --> 34:42.986
And you didn't.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.870
But we both know
that you could have,

34:44.916 --> 34:47.248
'cause that's exactly
where you are right now.

34:47.961 --> 34:49.952
You know, you want to continue
living your life this way?

34:50.005 --> 34:51.245
Go ahead.

34:53.425 --> 34:55.381
I can't do it anymore.

34:55.427 --> 34:57.292
I'm done.

35:04.227 --> 35:06.639
So that is Hudson? You lD'd him?

35:08.565 --> 35:10.681
Now, there aren't any of Hudson
actually dealing, though.

35:10.734 --> 35:12.474
But we got nearly a dozen of his crew.

35:12.527 --> 35:14.313
We bring 'em all in now
with the evidence we got,

35:14.362 --> 35:16.068
somebody will turn over.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.650
Looks like there's enough here
for a warrant.

35:17.699 --> 35:19.360
I'm gonna walk this up the line
to the Drug Squad.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.946
This is good work.
This is gonna look good on you boys.

35:21.995 --> 35:22.984
You kind of need that today.

35:23.038 --> 35:25.620
Thank you. Uh, but full credit
goes to Mr. Porter here.

35:25.665 --> 35:27.496
All we did was take his statement
and look at the photos.

35:27.876 --> 35:28.911
- Yeah.
- Yeah...

35:28.960 --> 35:32.748
Well, there is still the matter
of unlawful access of a police computer.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.833
(Dov) But unfortunately, sir,

35:34.883 --> 35:37.295
we never actually saw that guy's face.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.801
Yeah, could've been anybody.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.257
Well, if you do ever track him down,

35:45.310 --> 35:47.642
you might want to tell him
to lay off the heroics

35:47.687 --> 35:50.019
before he gets hurt
or sent back to jail.

35:52.192 --> 35:54.808
(Dov) Yes, sir, absolutely.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.186
Yeah? Looks like
he's got a hockey game.

35:58.239 --> 35:59.319
Get him out of here.

36:02.285 --> 36:04.321
Or a Halloween party.

36:09.668 --> 36:14.253
(woman) .l‘ When your whole world
is crashing down J‘

36:15.548 --> 36:20.167
.l‘ And no one seems to understand .l‘

36:21.179 --> 36:23.010
.l‘ You're crazy... J‘

36:23.056 --> 36:26.389
Leo's school concert.
He was a prince.

36:26.434 --> 36:29.551
Oh, I guess he's cute.

36:29.604 --> 36:31.060
That was before the show.

36:31.106 --> 36:34.974
It was a-a fairy tale
narrated by his teacher.

36:35.026 --> 36:37.142
Leo had one line,

36:37.195 --> 36:38.731
but the poor kid opened his mouth

36:38.780 --> 36:40.190
and puked all over his tunic.

36:40.240 --> 36:43.824
Eww! I mean, was, like, he okay?

36:43.868 --> 36:44.903
Yeah, he was fine.

36:44.953 --> 36:46.659
I mean, I got him all cleaned up,

36:46.705 --> 36:49.367
but, uh, he wouldn't stop crying,

36:49.791 --> 36:51.827
thought I was disappointed in him.

36:52.168 --> 36:54.204
What did you tell him?

36:54.254 --> 36:57.337
ljust told him I was his mommy
and he was my little man,

36:57.382 --> 36:59.293
and no matter what happens,

36:59.342 --> 37:02.209
nothing can ever change how much
a mother loves her child.

37:06.015 --> 37:07.801
You're gonna do fine tonight.

37:07.851 --> 37:09.591
And if you screw up, you know,

37:09.644 --> 37:14.684
you just clean up your tunic
and put your crown back on.

37:21.573 --> 37:23.484
Dad?

37:23.533 --> 37:28.448
I thought maybe you should
look after this for a while.

37:29.664 --> 37:31.450
Sure.

37:31.499 --> 37:33.706
(siren wailing in distance)

37:33.752 --> 37:37.916
Dad, look, I really meant what I said.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.713
You know...

37:47.766 --> 37:51.634
the day they cut Kaliciak's deal,

37:51.686 --> 37:56.020
| asked if I could be the one
to speak to her--

37:56.065 --> 37:57.601
Tina's mother.

37:58.943 --> 38:02.435
| just wanted to say l was sorry.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.902
It was my fault. I screwed up.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.443
lwas drinking...
way too much.

38:13.291 --> 38:17.534
She made me a-a coffee
in the kitchen.

38:17.587 --> 38:20.875
l was standing
about 6 feet from her when...

38:20.924 --> 38:22.664
she put the knife to her chest.

38:24.719 --> 38:26.050
(sighs)

38:26.095 --> 38:27.380
The amount of force it takes

38:27.430 --> 38:31.218
to get a blade through the rib cage, l...

38:31.267 --> 38:32.768
I didn't think...

38:33.770 --> 38:35.761
There was so much blood.

38:37.440 --> 38:40.557
She slipped right through my arms,

38:41.903 --> 38:43.609
and she said,

38:43.655 --> 38:46.738
"| just want to be with my little girl."

38:54.624 --> 38:56.740
(voice breaks)
I didn't know.

38:58.962 --> 39:00.827
I can't lose you, Andy.

39:09.639 --> 39:11.846
I'll do whatever it takes.

39:14.185 --> 39:16.767
(Oceanship's "Don't Wear Me Out"
playing)

39:21.067 --> 39:25.151
J‘ All my life, it seems, is bottled angst .l‘

39:25.196 --> 39:27.152
.l‘ Unbottled angst .l‘

39:27.198 --> 39:29.655
.l‘ And bottled angst .l‘

39:33.872 --> 39:35.487
- Ooh!
- Damn!

39:35.540 --> 39:36.905
- Ooh.
- That was sweet.

39:36.958 --> 39:39.449
All right, you two, get a room.
You're adorable.

39:39.502 --> 39:41.163
That's what I'm talkin' about.

39:42.714 --> 39:46.002
It looks like kid hero over there
is having a pretty good time.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.335
Well, he always wanted to be a cop.

39:47.385 --> 39:48.966
Figured we could let him
feel like one for a while.

39:49.012 --> 39:50.798
- Ah.
- One more.

39:50.847 --> 39:52.883
Yeah. Me, too, please.

39:52.932 --> 39:54.923
So--So what was
your superhero name?

39:55.727 --> 39:57.592
- What?
- Come on.

39:57.645 --> 39:59.510
Epstein, we all had 'em,
kids growing up.

39:59.564 --> 40:00.895
What was your superhero name?

40:01.941 --> 40:03.852
Oh.

40:03.902 --> 40:06.109
Well, mine was, um...

40:06.946 --> 40:07.935
"Justice Avenger."

40:07.989 --> 40:11.231
"Jus--" Nice. Nice.

40:11.284 --> 40:12.399
What about you?

40:12.452 --> 40:13.441
(laughs) Oh, yeah.

40:14.871 --> 40:16.611
I don't think so.

40:17.457 --> 40:20.699
J‘ Don't wear me out .l‘

40:20.752 --> 40:23.744
.l‘ Don't leave me here .l‘

40:23.796 --> 40:25.252
- Thank you.
- Hey.

40:25.298 --> 40:26.879
Hey.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.415
So how'd the big speech go?

40:28.843 --> 40:31.255
How would I know? I'm home sick.

40:31.679 --> 40:33.055
(snaps fingers)
Can I get a drink, please?

40:33.097 --> 40:35.713
J‘ Don't wear me out .l‘

40:35.767 --> 40:39.885
.l‘ Don't leave me here .l‘

40:39.938 --> 40:42.270
- (exhales sharply)
- .l‘ 'Cause I'm not giving up J‘

40:43.316 --> 40:46.274
.l‘ So I'm giving in .l‘

41:02.961 --> 41:04.952
Thank you for understanding.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.460
Of course.

41:07.799 --> 41:08.959
You okay?

41:09.801 --> 41:11.132
I am now.

41:11.678 --> 41:12.713
Trust me.

41:15.723 --> 41:19.636
.l‘ So don't wear me out .l‘

41:19.686 --> 41:23.395
.l‘ Don't leave me here .l‘

.l‘ 'Cause I'm not giving up J‘
