Tyson. Help!

00:09.009 --> 00:11.011
So what were you doing
in the alley?

00:11.054 --> 00:12.012
We were friends.

00:12.055 --> 00:13.056
I'm his father.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.231
I found Tyson lying dead.

00:14.275 --> 00:16.016
No, that's impossible.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.669
What I do know is that he
skipped town for good.

00:17.713 --> 00:20.063
Quit his job at the flower shop,
sold his stuff and everything.

00:20.107 --> 00:21.151
I've never done this before.

00:21.195 --> 00:22.892
What?Dated anyone.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.676
But I sort of want
to try that with you.

00:24.720 --> 00:27.549
Tyson witnessed the Crawford
murder, and you didn't tell me.

00:27.592 --> 00:29.159
You know we got to
keep work out of this.

00:29.203 --> 00:31.379
It's better for both of us.

00:31.422 --> 00:33.250
Yeah.

00:44.044 --> 00:46.176
Are you hungry again?Always.

00:46.220 --> 00:48.222
Can you open this?
Yeah.

00:50.963 --> 00:53.009
Here.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.664
Thank you.

00:55.707 --> 00:58.014
Oh, God, don't eat that.
That expired, like, a week ago.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.147
Tastes good, like a fine wine.

01:00.190 --> 01:04.151
Is that how you stay so thin?
Eat rotting food?

01:04.194 --> 01:05.717
You know, Tyson's dad said
he talked to Tyson

01:05.761 --> 01:08.329
a couple days ago, but...
I know I felt him in the alley.

01:08.372 --> 01:09.982
It... It doesn't make sense.

01:10.026 --> 01:13.116
Also not making sense, Tyson
worked at a flower shop?

01:13.160 --> 01:15.249
Exactly. Like,
what flower shop?

01:15.292 --> 01:17.773
Like... when? Why?

01:17.816 --> 01:19.122
Dude, you're asking me
like I know

01:19.166 --> 01:20.558
the answers to
these questions.

01:20.602 --> 01:22.343
Oh, tampons.
I need tampons.

01:22.386 --> 01:24.127
And so do you, actually,
because I used your last one

01:24.171 --> 01:26.564
this morning, sorry.

01:26.608 --> 01:28.479

Super plus.

01:28.523 --> 01:30.046
How do you wear these things?

01:30.090 --> 01:33.136

a tiny penis inside of me.

Wait, we're not
on our periods yet.
I am.

01:35.573 --> 01:38.924
I'm, like, two days in.
Oh, God.

01:38.968 --> 01:40.491
Are you late? Please
don't tell me you're late.

01:40.535 --> 01:42.189
It's probably stress.Murphy...

01:42.232 --> 01:44.104
I've taken so many
morning-after pills,

01:44.147 --> 01:46.584
if I'm not infertile
by this point, I'm suing them.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.934
We can't have a baby.I can feel the blood
brewing in me.

01:48.978 --> 01:51.067
Okay? I've been late before.
It's nothing.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.649
Of course.

with the tech guy?

02:09.999 --> 02:11.392
Uh, okay.

02:11.435 --> 02:12.871
I mean, I haven't heard
from him in, like, a week.

02:12.915 --> 02:14.438
He was really busy, and then
his sister was in town...

02:14.482 --> 02:16.223
Oh, sweet Chelsea.

02:16.266 --> 02:18.094
He's boning somebody else,
isn't he?

02:18.138 --> 02:19.617
He's definitely boning
someone else.

kill myself now, or...?[laughs]

About how I'm doing your job
ten times better than you are.

02:42.292 --> 02:43.772
Actually, I came to tell
you that I have a lead.

02:43.815 --> 02:45.077
So, no, you're not.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.210
A lead?
Yeah.

02:47.254 --> 02:52.215
A, uh, rival dealer was shot,
and Tyson was there.

02:52.259 --> 02:54.348
You think this rival
drug dealer killed Tyson?

02:54.391 --> 02:57.133
No, I-- Based on what you
told me about Tyson's dad,

02:57.177 --> 03:00.223
I think maybe this dealer's
people drove Tyson out of town.

03:00.267 --> 03:02.225
Oh.

03:02.269 --> 03:04.184

19:30.778 --> 19:33.041
because we can't
stay here all night.

19:33.084 --> 19:34.999
Oh, come on.

19:35.043 --> 19:37.959
I bet the thread count on
the sheets is off the chain.

19:38.002 --> 19:40.527

19:40.570 --> 19:44.574
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Text from Max.

19:44.618 --> 19:46.228
Okay, do you know
how much it sucks

19:46.272 --> 19:47.447
when the person you're dating
ignores you?

19:51.320 --> 19:52.582
Hi, Kathy.

19:52.626 --> 19:55.803
Hello, Jess.

19:55.846 --> 19:57.587
I love it here.

19:57.631 --> 19:58.806
KATHY:
You know,

19:58.849 --> 20:00.416
while Felix is still upstairs,

20:00.460 --> 20:03.245
may I say,
it's so nice of you two to come.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.247
Aw.
Aw.

20:05.291 --> 20:06.422
Are we, like, the first girls

20:06.466 --> 20:08.119
that Felix has ever
brought home?

20:08.163 --> 20:10.383
No, girls were
his brother's domain.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.254
Felix wasn't good at much.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.429
Hmm.

20:14.691 --> 20:17.651
FELIX: Hey.Mm. Fee, your sister sent over

20:17.694 --> 20:19.218
some chocolates,
isn't that nice?

20:19.261 --> 20:21.742
Go ahead, read the card.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.268
"Good-bye, Uncle Ralph.

20:26.312 --> 20:29.706
Sad face. Love, Lesley."

20:29.750 --> 20:31.273
How touching.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.275
What do you expect her
to write, an essay?

20:33.319 --> 20:34.842
She's on partner track,
it's very demanding.

20:34.885 --> 20:36.887
You know, actually,
Felix works really hard, too.

20:36.931 --> 20:38.889
Jess, don't.Yes, yes, I know.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.283
He's always telling me how busy
it is over at the pet store.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.285
It's actually not a pet store.

20:43.329 --> 20:44.504
It's a major nonprofit
that provides

20:44.547 --> 20:45.853
service animals to over

20:45.896 --> 20:47.724
500 people every year,
myself included.

20:47.768 --> 20:49.073
Hmm.

20:57.125 --> 20:59.649
Jules. Ooh,
what's with the face?

20:59.693 --> 21:01.085
Oh... [stammers]
Family thing.

21:01.129 --> 21:03.349
[chuckles]

21:03.392 --> 21:04.959
Where is everybody?

21:05.002 --> 21:07.962
They are on their way to raid
the trap house on Carver.

21:08.005 --> 21:10.312
Carver?

21:10.356 --> 21:12.140
I thought they were waiting
till after midnight.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.055
They got a call that it was
being cleaned out early.

21:14.098 --> 21:15.317
Took the TAC team
and everything.

21:15.361 --> 21:18.146
TAC team? That's aggressive.

21:18.189 --> 21:20.322
Could get ugly.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.845
Okay. I got to run.

21:21.889 --> 21:23.847
Uh, have a good night.
Don't stay too late.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.372
Yeah.

21:39.254 --> 21:41.038
Damn it.

21:44.128 --> 21:47.088
[pop song playing]

21:47.131 --> 21:49.220
Hey.
Hey. Murphy's not here.

21:49.264 --> 21:51.135
Actually, I, uh,
came here to see you.

21:51.179 --> 21:53.486
Really?
Yeah.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.923
Uh...

21:55.966 --> 21:58.404
You want to hang out
sometime? With me?

22:00.231 --> 22:02.973
Like, uh...

22:03.017 --> 22:06.934
I'm-I'm sorry, Officer,
are you trying to ask me out?

22:06.977 --> 22:08.849
Yes. Sorry.

22:08.892 --> 22:11.895
It's my first time doing this
since my wife died.

22:11.939 --> 22:15.029
Okay, I'm gonna
stop talking now.

22:15.072 --> 22:17.510
I get off in an hour.

22:17.553 --> 22:21.252
Okay.

22:21.296 --> 22:24.343
Cool.
Cool.

22:24.386 --> 22:27.868
[laughs]
See you later.

22:27.911 --> 22:29.435
MURPHY:
You know, I'm sort of digging

22:29.478 --> 22:31.480
this whole bitter thing
you got going with your mom.

22:31.524 --> 22:33.090
Gives you an edge.

22:33.134 --> 22:35.963
I'm so nice to her, and
she treats me like garbage.

22:36.006 --> 22:39.880
Then she bronzes my brother
and sister's turds.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.882
Oh, I know why
you're nice to her.

22:41.925 --> 22:44.319
Yeah. My therapist says
it's because I'm desperate

22:44.363 --> 22:45.886
for the attention
of strong female figures

22:45.929 --> 22:47.975
I never got as a child.

22:48.018 --> 22:50.760
Oh, I was gonna say it's
because you love her, but...

22:50.804 --> 22:53.937
It's just...

22:53.981 --> 22:56.244
my mom was never much of a mom.

22:56.287 --> 22:59.247
My dad was always off working.
Our nannies...

22:59.290 --> 23:01.380
Nannies, plural?

23:01.423 --> 23:03.382
Wow. Continue.

23:03.425 --> 23:07.342
My nannies-- I don't know--
were just...

23:07.386 --> 23:09.823
I always felt like
I was their job,

23:09.866 --> 23:11.868
and I was. [chuckles]

23:11.912 --> 23:13.870
Uncle Ralph's, like,
the only person in my family

23:13.914 --> 23:16.003
who I've thought
really cared about me.

23:16.046 --> 23:18.440
Aw, Felix.
FELIX:
It's super sad, right?

23:18.484 --> 23:21.138
Yeah.
Dude, you're, like,
the saddest,

23:21.182 --> 23:23.140
richest kid in
all of Chicago.

23:29.408 --> 23:30.583
We're empty.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.411
[chuckles][bottle clatters]

23:32.454 --> 23:34.978
Let's open up a Rothschild
and really piss Kathy off.

23:35.022 --> 23:36.676
[laughter]

23:36.719 --> 23:40.375
I love that that's
your idea of rebellion.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.594
The Bordeaux glasses
are upstairs.

23:41.637 --> 23:43.422
I'll be right back.

23:45.380 --> 23:46.860
Ow.

23:46.903 --> 23:49.340
Murphy, this has gone way past
the point of a casual visit.

23:49.384 --> 23:50.472
[snores]

23:50.516 --> 23:53.649
I feel so bad. This is so wrong.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.172
Maybe it's because I'm drunk,

23:55.216 --> 23:57.610
but I'm actually not hating
his company for once.

23:57.653 --> 23:58.872
Yeah, here's a crazy thought,

23:58.915 --> 24:00.700
maybe you shouldn't
be drinking right now.

24:00.743 --> 24:02.919
Oh, would you stop it?Murphy, wha...

24:02.963 --> 24:04.704
Come on, let's go.
No!

24:04.747 --> 24:07.010
Why?
Because when am I
gonna get the chance

24:07.054 --> 24:08.272
to feel another dead body?

24:08.316 --> 24:11.450
JESS: Are you listening
to the words...

24:11.493 --> 24:13.495
[Felix sighs]

24:13.539 --> 24:15.584
The reason you're here

24:15.628 --> 24:17.499
is because you want

24:17.543 --> 24:20.459
to feel a dead body?

24:22.286 --> 24:23.549
Oh, God.

24:23.592 --> 24:24.898
Just get out of my house.

24:24.941 --> 24:26.203
Hang on. Felix...

24:26.247 --> 24:28.075
Leave! Now!

24:40.348 --> 24:42.959
Well, this sucks.

24:43.003 --> 24:47.529
You are so focused on being
a good friend to Tyson

24:47.573 --> 24:49.009
that you are
completely oblivious

24:49.052 --> 24:52.142
how awful you are being
to everyone else.

24:52.186 --> 24:54.188
Okay, Jess. Cool. [laughs]

24:54.231 --> 24:57.757
Yeah, but, "Cool, cool, Jess,"
that's all you ever have to say.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.545
I can't...

25:03.589 --> 25:06.983
I can't go and-and feel
a dead body like it's nothing,

25:07.027 --> 25:10.204
and I can't hurt someone
like it's nothing,

25:10.247 --> 25:13.424
and I most certainly can't
just ignore my boyfriend

25:13.468 --> 25:16.297
when I might be-be
carrying his baby.

25:18.038 --> 25:20.910
I'm gonna go apologize to Felix.

25:20.954 --> 25:23.870
And, no, I'm not ignoring Max

25:23.913 --> 25:25.698
or the fact that
I might be carrying

25:25.741 --> 25:28.048
some stupid baby
inside of me.

25:28.091 --> 25:30.616
That's actually all I've been
thinking about all day.

25:30.659 --> 25:34.271
'Cause you know what?
I cannot even imagine the idea

25:34.315 --> 25:38.580
of passing on these messed-up
genes to anyone else!

25:38.624 --> 25:41.017
Murphy, your genes
aren't messed up.
