00:01.250 --> 00:02.250
Previously, on "The Path"...

00:03.264 --> 00:04.474
Will you come to my house?

00:04.474 --> 00:07.314
I'm not really supposed to
hang out with girls like you.

00:07.414 --> 00:10.254
I just really need someone
to see what's happening there.

00:10.254 --> 00:12.294
I just couldn't let
you live without light.

00:12.294 --> 00:14.414
Thank you.

00:14.414 --> 00:16.324
Why haven't I received a report

00:16.324 --> 00:17.414
on Miranda Frank's status?

00:17.414 --> 00:18.484
She's denying everything.

00:18.484 --> 00:20.434
I asked them to bring her here.

00:20.434 --> 00:23.424
It's our son... we want him
to do your rehab program.

00:23.424 --> 00:26.274
I promise we will get him off drugs.

00:26.274 --> 00:27.444
Steve let me know

00:27.444 --> 00:30.324
about the final rungs
that he's receiving.

00:30.324 --> 00:32.314
It's telling him that it is time

00:32.314 --> 00:34.284
to put a new leader in his place.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.314
It's you. It's always been you.

00:36.314 --> 00:38.404
What about the guy who did this to me?

00:38.404 --> 00:40.314
We're doing everything we can

00:40.314 --> 00:42.344
to gather information on him, Mr. Cox.

00:42.344 --> 00:45.404
Fucking animal has got my daughter.

00:45.404 --> 00:47.344
I will bring your daughter back.

00:47.344 --> 00:50.444
You're doing to me what
you have done to my family.

00:50.444 --> 00:54.324
You will stay here and
complete the program.

00:54.324 --> 00:56.314
Miranda Frank is here.

00:56.314 --> 00:59.264
- What is she doing here?
- She wouldn't unburden, Eddie.

00:59.264 --> 01:01.384
Hey, hey, hey, Miranda! What happened?

01:03.254 --> 01:07.432

01:59.404 --> 02:01.284
It's not him.

02:01.284 --> 02:03.284
Well, I think we should
just try him again.

02:03.284 --> 02:04.394
It's been at least two hours

02:04.394 --> 02:06.354
since they took her to the hospital.

02:06.354 --> 02:08.383
Cal said he'd let us know as
soon as the doctor had news.

02:08.383 --> 02:11.284
Ugh.

02:11.284 --> 02:12.444
Oh, God.

02:12.444 --> 02:15.304
Eddie,

02:15.304 --> 02:17.454
I need to unburden.

02:17.454 --> 02:19.424
I did this, whatever
happened to Miranda.

02:19.424 --> 02:20.464
Passing out...

02:20.464 --> 02:22.354
No, no, no. Hey, hey, hey.

02:22.354 --> 02:24.364
If it was anyone's fault, it was mine.

02:24.364 --> 02:25.364
- Listen to me.
- Stop.

02:25.364 --> 02:28.374
I lost my head.

02:28.374 --> 02:30.464
Is she in love with you?

02:30.464 --> 02:32.374
What? No. No.

02:32.374 --> 02:34.274
Sarah, I promise.

02:34.274 --> 02:37.274
'Cause it just doesn't make any sense.

02:37.274 --> 02:38.424
Is she trying to protect you?

02:38.424 --> 02:40.434
No, she is not in love with me.

02:40.434 --> 02:42.254
Okay? She's not.

02:42.254 --> 02:44.424
Why were you going to see her?

02:44.424 --> 02:47.304
Honestly, I...

02:47.304 --> 02:49.404
I just wanted to say that I was sorry.

03:00.254 --> 03:02.264
Bill and Felicia are coming.

03:05.384 --> 03:10.324
Those of you who climb
the rungs will not perish.

03:10.324 --> 03:13.364
You will live in The Garden forever.

03:13.364 --> 03:14.464
What happens to the rest of us?

03:14.464 --> 03:16.394
I don't know.

03:16.394 --> 03:20.334
Either we burn in the fire,
drown in the flood, or...

03:20.334 --> 03:21.374
get eaten by that.

03:21.374 --> 03:23.354
- What is that?
- I don't know.

03:23.354 --> 03:25.404
You really think these
people are criminals?

03:25.404 --> 03:28.354
Ah, all I know is I
have a father from Rindge

03:28.354 --> 03:31.454
who wants to get his daughter back.

03:31.454 --> 03:33.444
I'm gonna make sure
she gets out of there.

03:35.464 --> 03:38.364
Something dark going on.

03:38.364 --> 03:41.444
How do you know?

03:41.444 --> 03:43.344
Instinct, baby.

03:44.344 --> 03:45.404
Instinct.

03:47.474 --> 03:49.354
There's something wrong with her.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.434
Yeah, well, she's a baby. Babies cry.

03:51.434 --> 03:53.364
Not like this.

03:53.364 --> 03:55.364
- Doctor said it was colic.
- Look, I am telling you,

03:55.364 --> 03:57.304
there's something wrong.

03:57.304 --> 03:58.444
That's my fucking instinct.

04:10.284 --> 04:13.474
I can't believe this
place. The colors...

04:13.474 --> 04:16.303
When was the last time you were here?

04:16.303 --> 04:17.434
Must be about ten years.

04:17.434 --> 04:20.353
Ah... you were pregnant with Summer.

04:20.353 --> 04:22.294
So, just about.

04:22.294 --> 04:24.304
You look great, Eddie.

04:24.304 --> 04:29.254
I appreciate that. It's
been a rough couple weeks.

04:29.254 --> 04:30.464
We heard.

04:30.464 --> 04:32.434
Hey! Here they are!

04:32.434 --> 04:34.374
Aw.

04:34.374 --> 04:37.284
- Oh, my God. You never age.
- Oh, look at you.

04:37.284 --> 04:39.314
So happy to see you. Muah.

04:39.314 --> 04:42.334
- All this time.
- Oh!

04:42.334 --> 04:43.404
Pretty good, huh?

04:43.404 --> 04:46.324
Ah, the smell is so clean.

04:46.324 --> 04:49.334
San Diego is already burning.

04:49.334 --> 04:50.484
This is the place.

04:50.484 --> 04:53.374
Do you really think?

04:53.374 --> 04:55.344
Why don't I show you to your bungalow?

04:55.344 --> 04:57.404
Yeah.

04:57.404 --> 05:00.454
What made you decide to come?

05:00.454 --> 05:03.474
To join the Ascension Day festivities.

05:03.474 --> 05:06.304
Why wouldn't we come?

05:14.454 --> 05:17.404
How are you feeling?

05:17.404 --> 05:19.294
Tired.

05:19.294 --> 05:21.354
Oh, they have you on painkillers.

05:24.484 --> 05:27.334
Why am I here?

05:27.334 --> 05:29.484
The doctor said you passed
out, low blood sugar.

05:29.484 --> 05:31.454
You broke your arm when you fell.

05:31.454 --> 05:33.434
Yeah, no, I know why
I'm in the hospital.

05:36.444 --> 05:38.474
What I don't understand
is why Eddie's telling

05:38.474 --> 05:41.274
these crazy lies about me.

05:43.284 --> 05:46.454
Why is this happening to me?

05:46.454 --> 05:51.314
Sorry. Sorry.

05:51.314 --> 05:53.314
Sorry, I just...

06:04.304 --> 06:07.304
Can you think of anything that happened

06:07.304 --> 06:09.264
between you and Eddie
that may have led him

06:09.264 --> 06:11.254
to believe you were having an affair?

06:11.254 --> 06:12.454
Something he misconstrued?

06:12.454 --> 06:14.414
- No.
- Because...

06:14.414 --> 06:17.454
Steve once said to me,
"Sometimes a thought

06:17.454 --> 06:21.384
can be so powerful it
transcends thought."

06:25.274 --> 06:26.394
You mean, if I thought about Eddie

06:26.394 --> 06:28.374
in a way that was...

06:32.254 --> 06:33.384
Maybe...

06:33.384 --> 06:35.384
That thought took on
a life of its own, yes.

06:38.414 --> 06:39.464
Maybe...

06:39.464 --> 06:41.374
Tell me.

06:41.374 --> 06:43.354
You know I don't judge.

06:43.354 --> 06:48.304
So, Miranda and I, we had a long talk.

06:48.304 --> 06:50.284
What did she say?

06:50.284 --> 06:51.444
He was crying, and...

06:51.444 --> 06:53.344
What is it, Miranda?

06:53.344 --> 06:54.434
Unburden,

06:54.434 --> 06:57.314
and you shall be free of that weight.

06:57.314 --> 06:59.364
She unburdened.

06:59.364 --> 07:01.354
He took the medicine. He
said he saw his brother.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.434
She did?

07:02.434 --> 07:04.304
Then he went off somewhere,

07:04.304 --> 07:05.374
and when he came back,
something was wrong.

07:05.374 --> 07:07.414
Transgress 4, on the retreat.

07:07.414 --> 07:10.294
He kept saying, "There is no Light.

07:10.294 --> 07:13.394
There is no Light. There is no Light."

07:13.394 --> 07:15.354
And he was crying, and...

07:15.354 --> 07:17.324
What? What? What is it, Miranda?

07:17.324 --> 07:18.454
And she said that she and Eddie...

07:18.454 --> 07:22.394
Everything that happened in Peru.

07:25.334 --> 07:27.314
I hugged him.

07:31.484 --> 07:35.304
I wanted to take care of him,

07:35.304 --> 07:36.484
but he just cried,

07:36.484 --> 07:39.454
and then Silas took him away,
and we never spoke again.

07:42.334 --> 07:44.314
Do you think I...

07:49.484 --> 07:51.364
Ugh.

08:05.414 --> 08:07.254
Shh.

08:14.334 --> 08:16.374
It's over.

08:16.374 --> 08:19.354
You can start to heal.

08:30.334 --> 08:32.443
With this current, we
stimulate our neo-self...

08:32.443 --> 08:35.374
the self we were before the damage came.

08:35.374 --> 08:37.453
Are any of you able to find it?

08:37.453 --> 08:41.284
Yes.

08:41.284 --> 08:43.354
I found it.

08:43.354 --> 08:46.324
Great. Okay, let's all breathe in.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.314
Breathe the damage out.

08:51.424 --> 08:54.444
Today, I choose to live in The Light.

08:54.444 --> 08:57.404
Today, I choose to live in The Light.

08:57.404 --> 08:59.334
Great work, everyone.

08:59.334 --> 09:01.414
Okay, you can remove your machines

09:01.414 --> 09:04.364
and put them back in the basket.

09:04.364 --> 09:06.344
Thanks, Sarah.

09:14.374 --> 09:16.434
- Hi!
- Hi.

09:16.434 --> 09:18.424
How are you feeling?

09:18.424 --> 09:20.304
- Really good.
- Yeah?

09:20.304 --> 09:22.414
Yeah.

09:22.414 --> 09:25.314
And I wanted to say...

09:25.314 --> 09:27.384
I'm sorry.

09:27.384 --> 09:29.334
These last two weeks
have made me realize

09:29.334 --> 09:31.434
how much I've hurt you.

09:31.434 --> 09:33.444
I'm so sorry for what
I've put you through,

09:33.444 --> 09:35.254
and myself through.

09:35.254 --> 09:37.474
I-I hit my bottom. Right?

09:37.474 --> 09:39.464
I know I did, but I'm
not gonna do it anymore.

09:39.464 --> 09:40.474
- Okay.
- All right?

09:40.474 --> 09:42.314
I can't do it anymore.

09:42.314 --> 09:43.484
I'm sorry, Dad.

10:01.404 --> 10:04.364
Hey. Um, could you tell me

10:04.364 --> 10:06.354
where Miranda Frank's room is, please?

10:09.444 --> 10:12.454
Oh, she's no longer here.

10:12.454 --> 10:15.454
- She's gone?
- Yep. Checked out this morning.

10:19.344 --> 10:22.384
Look, I'm sorry, I was told
that she was gonna be here

10:22.384 --> 10:25.314
for a few more days.

10:25.314 --> 10:26.464
- Nope.
- Could you tell me

10:26.464 --> 10:29.304
if she left with someone, or...

10:29.304 --> 10:30.374
That kind of information's confidential.

10:32.274 --> 10:33.404
All right, I should've
told you this before,

10:33.404 --> 10:35.444
but I'm... I'm her brother, okay?

10:35.444 --> 10:37.374
And I just need to know where she went.

10:37.374 --> 10:39.424
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

10:39.424 --> 10:41.314
God.

10:41.314 --> 10:44.424
You see, I think that you can help me.

10:44.424 --> 10:46.324
I just need you to tell me

10:46.324 --> 10:48.354
if you know where she
went or who she went with

10:48.354 --> 10:50.274
or what the fuck is going on with her.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.414
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just... look.

10:51.414 --> 10:54.254
This is very important, okay?

10:54.254 --> 10:55.364
I'm gonna ask you once to leave,

10:55.364 --> 10:56.444
and then I'm gonna call security.

10:56.444 --> 10:58.284
Oh, my God.

10:58.284 --> 11:00.344
All right. You know what? Forget it.

11:00.344 --> 11:01.404
He's from that cult, right?

11:01.404 --> 11:04.284
It's not a fucking cult!

11:04.284 --> 11:05.404
What happened with Eddie Lane, Silas?

11:05.404 --> 11:07.384
On the 6R retreat?

11:07.384 --> 11:09.424
We took the medicine.

11:09.424 --> 11:11.414
We saw Light.

11:11.414 --> 11:13.344
We climbed The Ladder.

11:13.344 --> 11:15.364
You're gonna have to give
me a little more than that.

11:15.364 --> 11:17.344
What happens on a retreat is private.

11:17.344 --> 11:20.354
It's between the Ascender and The Light.

11:21.474 --> 11:25.274
Why are Bill and Felicia here?

11:25.274 --> 11:28.314
Why do you think Bill
and Felicia are there?

11:28.314 --> 11:30.444
Because they think I'm fucking up

11:30.444 --> 11:33.304
with running things, this whole...

11:33.304 --> 11:35.344
this whole thing with Miranda Frank.

11:35.344 --> 11:37.344
Well, there you go.

11:37.344 --> 11:39.464
Everything you need to know, you know.

11:39.464 --> 11:41.374
You're 10R, after all.

11:41.374 --> 11:44.434
Well, I don't know what Eddie's hiding.

11:44.434 --> 11:46.334
Huh.

11:46.334 --> 11:48.484
Don't you?

11:48.484 --> 11:50.464
I intend to find out.

11:54.404 --> 11:56.444
I heard Bill and Felicia
can take one look at you

11:56.444 --> 11:58.354
and see your entire life.

11:58.354 --> 12:00.274
I heard we're gonna get
to see Felicia's hands.

12:00.274 --> 12:01.404
- What about her hands?
- My dad said they've come

12:01.404 --> 12:04.314
to check on things
because this is the place.

12:04.314 --> 12:06.294
- What place?
- Where The Garden will be.

12:06.294 --> 12:07.324
When The Future comes.

12:07.324 --> 12:08.444
It's coming? When?

12:08.444 --> 12:10.304
Nobody knows when.

12:10.304 --> 12:12.354
Hawk, your family knows everything.

12:12.354 --> 12:15.254
Hawk?

12:15.254 --> 12:16.364
Hawk!

12:16.364 --> 12:20.334
- What?
- Is The Future coming?

12:20.334 --> 12:21.334
Yes.

12:22.344 --> 12:24.324
I don't want it to come.

12:37.963 --> 12:40.777
_

12:46.324 --> 12:49.444
Do you think that he'll
be ready to come home soon?

12:49.444 --> 12:52.284
I think your son has gotten very good

12:52.284 --> 12:54.454
at knowing what you want to hear.

12:54.454 --> 12:57.334
I know my son.

12:57.334 --> 12:59.344
Well, I know Truth.

12:59.344 --> 13:01.454
And he's lying.

13:01.454 --> 13:03.444
What can we do?

13:03.444 --> 13:05.474
We believe that people
with serious addictions

13:05.474 --> 13:09.274
like Freddie are using drugs to...

13:09.274 --> 13:11.344
to bury some deep pain.

13:11.344 --> 13:13.284
We use a special medicinal compound

13:13.284 --> 13:14.424
to help find that wound.

13:14.424 --> 13:16.484
And once they do, they
begin to start to heal.

13:16.484 --> 13:19.264
What kind of medicinal compound?

13:19.264 --> 13:22.284
It's a special brew
of dimethyltryptamine.

13:22.284 --> 13:23.484
It's a new approach to medicine.

13:23.484 --> 13:25.414
They've been using it the last few years

13:25.414 --> 13:27.304
on cancer patients at Sloan Kettering

13:27.304 --> 13:29.454
Ayahuasca? It's Ayahuasca.

13:29.454 --> 13:31.364
It does have some of
the same properties.

13:31.364 --> 13:33.464
This is bullshit. I
knew it was bullshit,

13:33.464 --> 13:35.434
and I let you convince me,
but now I've had enough.

13:35.434 --> 13:37.404
We're going. Get Freddie.

13:37.404 --> 13:39.414
You take Freddie out of here,
and he will have a needle

13:39.414 --> 13:43.404
in his arm within 24 hours.

13:43.404 --> 13:45.384
Honey? Can we just...

13:45.384 --> 13:47.284
We're going.

13:57.334 --> 14:00.474
You reached out like the first of us

14:00.474 --> 14:03.334
to reach out for that rung.

14:03.334 --> 14:06.434
But every single one of you has
known the courage that he show...

14:08.264 --> 14:09.274
Eddie.

14:09.274 --> 14:10.334
Where is she?

14:10.334 --> 14:12.354
Where is Miranda?

14:12.354 --> 14:14.324
I went to the hospital, Cal.

14:14.324 --> 14:17.314
Well, she's being taken care of, Eddie.

14:17.314 --> 14:18.484
- What does that mean?
- She's resting peacefully.

14:18.484 --> 14:21.304
She didn't want to be
in a hospital anymore.

14:21.304 --> 14:24.454
All right, well, look.

14:24.454 --> 14:27.334
She deserves an apology, okay?

14:31.304 --> 14:32.434
I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.

14:32.434 --> 14:35.304
- Why not?
- Because maybe she'd prefer

14:35.304 --> 14:37.414
not to see you.

14:37.414 --> 14:39.404
And I'll tell you someone
else who'd probably prefer

14:39.404 --> 14:40.454
you didn't see her is your wife.

14:40.454 --> 14:43.324
- Ugh.
- So let it go, Eddie.

14:43.324 --> 14:47.334
Miranda understands you're sorry
for everything that happened

14:47.334 --> 14:49.314
between the two of you.

14:52.334 --> 14:56.284
Unless... there's more to the story.

15:02.484 --> 15:04.464
You don't trust me.

15:08.434 --> 15:11.294
You used to.

15:11.294 --> 15:13.274
We were close.

15:17.294 --> 15:19.274
What happened?

15:19.274 --> 15:22.284
I guess people change, Cal.

15:34.454 --> 15:38.384
You should do 7R, Eddie.

15:38.384 --> 15:40.344
- What?
- Get back on The Ladder.

15:40.344 --> 15:41.444
I'll be your guide.

15:41.444 --> 15:43.374
I just finished 6.

15:43.374 --> 15:46.424
No, it's the most thrilling
rung of The Ladder.

15:46.424 --> 15:48.274
It... it...

15:48.274 --> 15:51.374
you and your guide, you... become one.

15:51.374 --> 15:54.404
Together, you break down
each other's delusions,

15:54.404 --> 15:56.314
the lies we tell ourselves,

15:56.314 --> 15:58.324
the lies that we tell others.

16:00.404 --> 16:04.274
I-I think we...

16:04.274 --> 16:07.344
we can really learn
a lot from each other.

16:16.137 --> 16:18.484
Of course. No, I understand that.

16:18.484 --> 16:20.374
I understand why you're angry.

16:20.374 --> 16:24.264
I will fix this for you, John.

16:24.264 --> 16:28.324
John, if you bring Freddie
back in, I promise...

16:31.484 --> 16:34.264
Sarah!

16:34.264 --> 16:37.294
When were you gonna tell me
what happened with John Ridge?

16:37.294 --> 16:39.324
Well, sorry, I'm not gonna
tell him his son is cured

16:39.324 --> 16:40.464
just because he said he was
gonna give us a million dollars.

16:40.464 --> 16:42.424
You shouldn't have
recommended the medicine.

16:42.424 --> 16:45.264
Why? It's one of our most
successful methods of treatment.

16:45.264 --> 16:47.334
Besides, Freddie Ridge is not
gonna get better without it.

16:47.334 --> 16:49.324
Well, we're not gonna be
using the medicine anymore.

16:49.324 --> 16:51.334
The medicine is one of the
foundations of our movement.

16:51.334 --> 16:54.394
It's dangerous, and we're
trying to reach more people.

16:54.394 --> 16:56.304
We just had a member
wind up in the hospital,

16:56.304 --> 16:57.464
and we need to start being more careful.

16:57.464 --> 17:00.264
John Ridge is a powerful
man. If something happened

17:00.264 --> 17:01.324
to his kid, it would
be all over the news,

17:01.324 --> 17:02.394
and we would be shut down.

17:02.394 --> 17:04.364
We would never survive that, all right?

17:04.364 --> 17:06.253
So if his kid comes back here,

17:06.253 --> 17:07.473
you are not to give him the medicine.

17:10.394 --> 17:12.454
Am I clear?

17:19.344 --> 17:20.464
Um, can you please eat some?

17:20.464 --> 17:22.364
I'm eating, like, all of them.

17:22.364 --> 17:25.284
You should. You didn't even eat lunch.

17:28.374 --> 17:30.404
How'd you know?

17:30.404 --> 17:32.394
I saw.

17:36.414 --> 17:39.384
So are you allowed to go to parties?

17:39.384 --> 17:41.284
Yeah.

17:41.284 --> 17:43.434
We have one tomorrow
afternoon for Ascension Day.

17:43.434 --> 17:45.344
No, I mean like real parties.

17:45.344 --> 17:47.414
Like, at night.

17:47.414 --> 17:50.334
There's one tomorrow in Magic Meadow.

17:54.314 --> 17:56.464
So do you want to go?

18:02.334 --> 18:05.404
Um... I don't think I'm allowed.

18:07.424 --> 18:10.474
Okay, just don't tell your parents.

18:10.474 --> 18:14.294
We're not supposed
to lie to our parents.

18:14.294 --> 18:16.394
Okay, this sounds like
the worst religion ever.

18:18.344 --> 18:20.394
Do you like Arcade Fire?

18:20.394 --> 18:23.414
We're not allowed to play video games.

18:23.414 --> 18:24.444
Uh, it is a band,

18:24.444 --> 18:27.384
not a video game.

18:27.384 --> 18:30.414
Are you even allowed to
listen to music, or...

18:30.414 --> 18:32.354
No, yeah, we... we are.

18:32.354 --> 18:35.364
We just...

18:35.364 --> 18:40.254
a lot of contemporary music
brings darkness into the world,

18:40.254 --> 18:43.464
so we listen to stuff
from the '60s and '70s.

18:43.464 --> 18:45.364
More hopeful.

18:45.364 --> 18:48.274
So old people music
is what you're saying.

18:54.254 --> 18:56.404
Um, you should borrow this.

19:00.374 --> 19:03.434
It'll change the way
you look at the world.

19:42.374 --> 19:45.264
Thought I might find you here.

19:47.444 --> 19:49.474
In your contemplation spot.

19:55.314 --> 19:58.324
Wow.

19:58.324 --> 20:03.414
So what are you
contemplating this evening?

20:05.394 --> 20:08.374
The longest 48 hours.

20:08.374 --> 20:10.324
Mm.

20:10.324 --> 20:12.374
And Cal's giving me shit

20:12.374 --> 20:15.414
about Freddie Ridge, and...

20:15.414 --> 20:17.394
this Miranda thing.

20:20.384 --> 20:23.354
Hopefully, we can all get past this now.

20:25.434 --> 20:28.304
Really?

20:28.304 --> 20:30.284
Yeah.

20:30.284 --> 20:32.274
I want to.

20:36.304 --> 20:39.274
Hey, so, um...

20:39.274 --> 20:42.434
Cal... he asked me to move up to 7R.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.294
Really?

20:48.294 --> 20:51.364
I know, it's really quick, but...

20:51.364 --> 20:54.274
he thinks I'm ready.

20:54.274 --> 20:56.464
Silas is an amazing guide.

20:56.464 --> 20:59.374
You know, when he led me,

20:59.374 --> 21:01.484
he saw things in me,

21:01.484 --> 21:04.444
and I in him.

21:04.444 --> 21:06.474
Actually, Cal would be my guide.

21:09.424 --> 21:13.294
What?

21:13.294 --> 21:15.284
Nothing.

21:15.284 --> 21:18.264
I think it's great.

21:18.264 --> 21:19.434
And, you know,

21:19.434 --> 21:24.454
at 7R, you'd only be one rung below me.

21:24.454 --> 21:26.374
Hm.

21:26.374 --> 21:29.314
Well, that's because
I'm coming after you.

21:29.314 --> 21:31.274
Oh, really?

21:31.274 --> 21:32.424
- Yeah.
- You're coming after me?

21:32.424 --> 21:34.314
Yeah, I'm coming straight
for you, actually.

21:34.314 --> 21:36.284
- Oh, well then.
- Yeah.

21:36.284 --> 21:38.284
Come and get me.

21:40.484 --> 21:43.434
So, are we... are we good?

21:46.294 --> 21:49.294
You know what might make us good

21:49.294 --> 21:51.484
is you jumping in this lake.

21:51.484 --> 21:54.424
Oh, yeah?

21:54.424 --> 21:56.264
Yeah.

21:56.264 --> 21:57.294
You want me to jump in the lake?

21:57.294 --> 21:58.334
- Yeah, I kind of do.
- Okay.

21:58.334 --> 21:59.414
And that'll make us good?

21:59.414 --> 22:01.394
I think that'll make us good.

22:03.334 --> 22:05.284
Oh, no, no, no.

22:05.284 --> 22:07.334
Is it cold?

22:07.334 --> 22:08.434
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, I definitely want you

22:08.434 --> 22:10.274
to jump in.

22:10.274 --> 22:14.264
Well, I want us to be good, so...

22:14.264 --> 22:16.284
I'll go in. But you
have to come with me.

22:16.284 --> 22:17.394
Oh, my God. There's no way.

22:17.394 --> 22:19.364
- Yeah. No, come on.
- No, there's... no!

22:19.364 --> 22:21.274
- Come on.
- Don't! Don't! No!

22:21.274 --> 22:24.404
Don't you dare. Don't, Eddie!

22:24.404 --> 22:26.384
Ah!

22:32.414 --> 22:34.344
- Oh!
- Oh, my God. Oh, God.

22:34.344 --> 22:36.254
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:36.254 --> 22:37.434
I can't believe we just did that.

22:37.434 --> 22:40.414
We are definitely not good.

22:40.414 --> 22:41.474
- Oh, we're not good?
- Definitely not.

22:41.474 --> 22:43.344
Okay, that's fine.

22:43.344 --> 22:45.354
Oh, my God. It's really cold.

22:45.354 --> 22:49.294
Stop... I'm freezing!

23:13.424 --> 23:17.374
- Brr, it's so cold!
- It's so fucking cold.

23:17.374 --> 23:20.414
Oh, my God.

23:20.414 --> 23:22.434
- Did you drive?
- Yeah.

23:22.434 --> 23:24.424
- Okay.
- We should maybe go.

23:24.424 --> 23:26.274
Okay, on the count of three,

23:26.274 --> 23:28.254
we're gonna run for it, okay?

23:28.254 --> 23:29.484
- Yeah.
- One...

23:29.484 --> 23:31.474
Two. Three!

23:31.474 --> 23:33.434
- Go! Oh, my God.
- Oh! Oh! Oh, my God.

23:33.434 --> 23:36.284
- Hurry! Hurry!
- This is colder-running!

23:41.384 --> 23:43.254
Hey.

23:43.254 --> 23:45.394
Hey, Felicia. I was just about to leave.

23:45.394 --> 23:47.484
I'm sorry we haven't had a
chance to catch up properly.

23:47.484 --> 23:49.434
I've been so busy getting
ready for tomorrow.

23:49.434 --> 23:51.364
Let me take something off your plate.

23:51.364 --> 23:54.404
No, no, no. No need. I
think we're all set now.

23:54.404 --> 23:57.284
Well, thank you for
putting everything together.

23:57.284 --> 23:58.404
- Of course.
- Now you get to sit back

23:58.404 --> 23:59.424
and enjoy the day tomorrow.

23:59.424 --> 24:01.294
Well...

24:01.294 --> 24:03.464
Bill and I will take things from here.

24:03.464 --> 24:06.284
Well, I've prepared the
Ascension Day oration.

24:06.284 --> 24:07.384
Oh, I'll do it.

24:07.384 --> 24:09.264
I was there, after all,
the day it happened.

24:09.264 --> 24:10.264
True.

24:10.264 --> 24:11.284
Okay.

24:11.284 --> 24:12.284
See you tomorrow.

24:12.284 --> 24:14.264
Yeah. Yeah.

24:25.354 --> 24:27.334
Come in.

24:32.384 --> 24:34.414
Hi. Sorry to come by so late.

24:34.414 --> 24:36.414
It's okay.

24:38.444 --> 24:40.274
I wanted to ask you a favor.

24:40.274 --> 24:41.454
Anything.

24:41.454 --> 24:45.454
Ascension Day, tomorrow...

24:45.454 --> 24:47.384
I want you to speak.

24:47.384 --> 24:49.364
- Me?
- Mm-hm.

24:49.364 --> 24:51.254
You've been doing so well here.

24:51.254 --> 24:52.474
I'm very impressed with you.

24:55.324 --> 24:57.454
I've been hanging out a lot with Sean.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.444
Oh. Yeah, yeah.

25:00.444 --> 25:02.284
How's that going?

25:02.284 --> 25:03.464
It's good.

25:03.464 --> 25:05.474
Fun, I think... I don't know,

25:05.474 --> 25:09.264
but I think he likes me.

25:09.264 --> 25:11.394
Well, of course he likes
you. You're beautiful.

25:11.394 --> 25:14.454
Not... not just outside.

25:14.454 --> 25:17.324
Inside.

25:17.324 --> 25:20.474
You're bursting with Light, Mary.

25:20.474 --> 25:23.444
Well, we haven't had sex yet.

25:27.314 --> 25:28.384
Oh, no?

25:28.384 --> 25:30.324
Mm-mm.

25:30.324 --> 25:33.434
But...

25:33.434 --> 25:37.294
he kisses me a lot.

25:37.294 --> 25:40.274
Hm.

25:43.294 --> 25:45.274
Where?

25:49.334 --> 25:52.424
First, my neck.

25:52.424 --> 25:56.364
No, no.

26:07.354 --> 26:11.284
My mouth.

26:11.284 --> 26:16.354
My lips.

26:16.354 --> 26:19.284
And what else?

26:24.264 --> 26:26.264
Over my chest.

26:31.314 --> 26:33.314
Then...

26:39.414 --> 26:42.354
Right...

26:42.354 --> 26:44.264
here.

26:44.264 --> 26:46.334
But I was pretending it was you.

26:48.484 --> 26:50.254
Is that bad?

27:11.354 --> 27:13.354
Thank you, Mary.

27:16.424 --> 27:18.454
Now get some rest.

27:18.454 --> 27:20.434
Have a big day tomorrow.

27:43.274 --> 27:45.434
On October 28, 1974,

27:45.434 --> 27:49.294
we watched Steve climb The Ladder.

27:49.294 --> 27:53.284
Me, my husband William, and Silas.

27:53.284 --> 27:55.264
I tried to climb after him,

27:55.264 --> 27:58.364
but when I went to touch The Ladder,

27:58.364 --> 28:00.374
it was burning hot.

28:03.314 --> 28:05.314
Oh, my God.

28:07.354 --> 28:10.324
Steve was allowed to climb

28:10.324 --> 28:13.344
so he could deliver the message.

28:14.454 --> 28:18.484
And you, you...

28:18.484 --> 28:23.424
all of you heard the word.

28:23.424 --> 28:26.354
And now the word is in you.

28:27.434 --> 28:32.294
The message: there is work to do.

28:32.294 --> 28:34.264
Oh, yeah.

28:34.264 --> 28:36.294
We must refuse Ignorance.

28:36.294 --> 28:38.364
We must refuse Damage.

28:38.364 --> 28:42.384
We must save the world from The Future.

28:42.384 --> 28:44.374
Yes.

28:46.444 --> 28:50.254
Today, we celebrate

28:50.254 --> 28:53.284
that the message came to us,

28:53.284 --> 28:55.464
that The Light lives inside us.

28:55.464 --> 28:58.374
And we renew our promise

28:58.374 --> 29:00.364
to keep it alive.

29:05.414 --> 29:08.304
Whoo!

29:08.304 --> 29:10.394
Whoo!

29:10.394 --> 29:13.484
So everyone in here is on a
different rung of The Ladder.

29:13.484 --> 29:15.344
And what am I?

29:15.344 --> 29:16.374
Well, you're not on The Ladder yet.

29:16.374 --> 29:18.444
You are what we call a Possible.

29:18.444 --> 29:21.474
If you want to climb to 10,
you have to devote your life

29:21.474 --> 29:22.484
to service of The Movement.

29:22.484 --> 29:24.334
Ah, lovely day, huh?

29:24.334 --> 29:25.464
Every day here is.

29:25.464 --> 29:28.414
Yeah. That's what I hear.

29:28.414 --> 29:30.304
How did you find this place?

29:30.304 --> 29:32.284
This place found me.

29:38.414 --> 29:40.414
- Almost.
- Not really.

29:40.414 --> 29:44.334
It's better than it was before.

29:44.334 --> 29:45.364
Ugh!

29:45.364 --> 29:46.384
So who was that girl?

29:46.384 --> 29:48.364
'Cause you can go so far.

29:52.394 --> 29:54.374
Hey, Summer.

29:54.374 --> 29:56.344
They're doing face
painting by the musicians.

29:56.344 --> 29:59.394
Can I go?

29:59.394 --> 30:01.374
Yeah.

30:08.324 --> 30:10.364
Nobody.

30:10.364 --> 30:11.454
What, is she, like, a cheerleader?

30:11.454 --> 30:15.284
She's not a cheerleader.

30:15.284 --> 30:17.454
She plays softball.

30:19.354 --> 30:20.464
You're totally in love with her.

30:20.464 --> 30:22.434
I'm not in love with her.

30:22.434 --> 30:25.264
I just said she plays softball.

30:25.264 --> 30:29.284
She's probably just trying
to see if she can corrupt you.

30:29.284 --> 30:30.384
She's not gonna corrupt me.

30:30.384 --> 30:32.364
She's gonna try.

30:34.424 --> 30:38.304
Did she try to kiss you?

30:38.304 --> 30:40.284
No.

30:42.354 --> 30:45.334
What you're feeling
is just hormones, Hawk.

30:47.254 --> 30:49.324
I have sexual feelings too.

30:49.324 --> 30:50.464
It's natural.

30:50.464 --> 30:54.334
But it's not real.

30:54.334 --> 30:55.484
You have to unburden to your parents.

30:55.484 --> 30:59.414
I don't have anything to unburden.

31:03.304 --> 31:05.354
Family and honesty is the cornerstone

31:05.354 --> 31:08.384
of The Movement.

31:08.384 --> 31:10.424
You could lose all of us.

31:12.454 --> 31:16.314
I mean, you do want to
be with us, don't you?

31:16.314 --> 31:18.314
When The Future comes?

31:26.394 --> 31:29.274
And then... and then the phone rang.

31:29.274 --> 31:31.394
And... oh, I forget what we were doing.

31:31.394 --> 31:33.254
We were smoking. What
else would we be doing?

31:33.254 --> 31:35.394
Oh, I was pregnant. I was not smoking.

31:35.394 --> 31:38.394
And you said, "Gaby,
get Hank on the phone.

31:38.394 --> 31:41.424
"We've just had the most
incredible experience.

31:41.424 --> 31:43.314
I burned my hands."

31:43.314 --> 31:44.404
You shouted, "Felicia
just burned her hands!

31:44.404 --> 31:45.464
Get on the other line!"

31:45.464 --> 31:47.274
Yeah, and you picked up the phone,

31:47.274 --> 31:48.394
and you said...

31:48.394 --> 31:50.334
"Toothpaste. Toothpaste
works for a burn."

31:51.334 --> 31:52.404
You guys were high.

31:52.404 --> 31:54.424
I said, "Oh, no." I said, "No.

31:54.424 --> 31:57.364
"We found it.

31:57.364 --> 31:59.294
"Get on a plane and get down here.

31:59.294 --> 32:00.444
We found The Light."

32:00.444 --> 32:04.254
And we did. And that's when we met Doc.

32:04.254 --> 32:06.454
And I remember thinking,

32:06.454 --> 32:09.414
"Today's the day.

32:09.414 --> 32:12.284
It is the first day of my life."

32:12.284 --> 32:14.274
Great marijuana down there, too.

32:14.274 --> 32:15.294
I wish I'd never left.

32:19.324 --> 32:20.374
It was great to see you.

32:20.374 --> 32:22.264
See you real soon.

32:22.264 --> 32:23.304
Bye.

32:23.304 --> 32:25.474
Bye-bye.

32:25.474 --> 32:27.454
Great day.

32:27.454 --> 32:30.354
Yeah. My favorite day of the year.

32:30.354 --> 32:32.434
You haven't gotten anything to eat.

32:32.434 --> 32:34.394
I don't like to let
the members see me eat.

32:34.394 --> 32:36.274
It shows weakness.

32:36.274 --> 32:37.434
It also shows community.

32:44.434 --> 32:47.444
Ah, there you are.

32:47.444 --> 32:49.484
Eh, hey.

32:49.484 --> 32:52.374
Yeah, I just...

32:52.374 --> 32:54.404
I just wanted to get away for a minute.

32:54.404 --> 32:56.444
Me too. It's exhausting.

32:56.444 --> 32:58.374
Yeah.

32:58.374 --> 33:01.254
How you doing?

33:01.254 --> 33:03.364
Uh, good. Good.

33:03.364 --> 33:07.434
You know, I think Sarah
and I are gonna be okay.

33:07.434 --> 33:11.344
So that's what matters.

33:11.344 --> 33:13.374
Yes, it is.

33:17.394 --> 33:19.364
Can I ask you a question?

33:19.364 --> 33:22.444
Mm-hm.

33:22.444 --> 33:25.364
Have you talked to Miranda

33:25.364 --> 33:27.314
since she left the hospital?

33:27.314 --> 33:29.344
She left the hospital?

33:29.344 --> 33:31.394
I wasn't aware.

33:31.394 --> 33:35.414
Cal said that she just didn't
want to be there anymore,

33:35.414 --> 33:38.304
said she's resting someplace.

33:41.454 --> 33:45.434
I hear he asked you to climb 7R.

33:45.434 --> 33:49.394
Yeah.

33:49.394 --> 33:53.344
It'll be good for us to
have someone close to him.

33:53.344 --> 33:55.354
We'd ask Sarah to keep an eye out,

33:55.354 --> 33:57.484
but she doesn't always see clearly

33:57.484 --> 34:00.294
when it comes to Cal.

34:07.264 --> 34:12.344
I came here from Rindge, New Hampshire.

34:12.344 --> 34:15.353
My mom died when I was
little, so my dad raised me.

34:18.333 --> 34:21.444
When I was 11,

34:21.444 --> 34:24.284
my dad told me that his
friend was coming over,

34:24.284 --> 34:27.414
and I should do what he
said, otherwise I'd get hit.

34:31.404 --> 34:36.373
So his friend came over...

34:36.373 --> 34:38.484
and afterwards,

34:38.484 --> 34:43.353
I saw him give my dad some money.

34:43.353 --> 34:47.434
And I remember wondering,

34:47.434 --> 34:52.254
"How much was I?"

34:52.254 --> 34:55.353
And later I saw.

34:55.353 --> 34:57.394
It was a $10 bill.

35:08.284 --> 35:10.264
May I?

35:16.284 --> 35:20.454
I will carry you

35:20.454 --> 35:23.384
To The Light

35:23.384 --> 35:28.364
I will carry you

35:28.364 --> 35:30.434
To The Light

35:32.454 --> 35:35.404
I'll carry you

35:39.294 --> 35:40.444
You carry me

35:40.444 --> 35:42.354
Um, I have to go. It's an emergency.

35:42.354 --> 35:43.464
It's for Ridge's son.

35:43.464 --> 35:48.324
We will carry each other

35:48.324 --> 35:50.344
To The Light

35:50.344 --> 35:53.324
Oh, Light

35:53.324 --> 35:59.264
Carry each other to The Light

35:59.264 --> 36:04.404
We will carry each other to The Light

36:04.404 --> 36:07.344
Oh, Light

36:07.344 --> 36:12.374
Carry each other to The Light

36:12.374 --> 36:16.384
Oh, we will carry each other

36:16.384 --> 36:18.344
To The Light

36:18.344 --> 36:21.294
Oh, Light

36:21.294 --> 36:25.464
Carry each other to The Light

36:25.464 --> 36:29.424
We will carry each other

36:29.424 --> 36:33.444
To The Light oh, Light

36:33.444 --> 36:38.414
Carry each other to The Light

36:38.414 --> 36:42.264
I'll carry you

36:42.264 --> 36:45.394
You carry me

36:45.394 --> 36:49.304
We will carry each other

36:49.304 --> 36:53.394
To The Light oh, Light

36:53.394 --> 36:58.374
Carry each other to The Light

37:04.294 --> 37:06.344
Lot more sky up here than in San Diego.

37:06.344 --> 37:08.284
Mm.

37:08.284 --> 37:11.344
I don't like the way
you're looking at that sky.

37:15.454 --> 37:17.394
I had a feeling this was coming.

37:17.394 --> 37:20.284
You've gotten a little too
big for your britches, son.

37:20.284 --> 37:22.264
I'm not your son.

37:22.264 --> 37:23.474
A 6R from the Midwest

37:23.474 --> 37:27.364
was forcibly removed from
her home and brought here.

37:27.364 --> 37:29.254
You're trying to get
rid of the medicine.

37:29.254 --> 37:30.384
Steve put me in charge.

37:30.384 --> 37:34.254
And asked us to watch over you.

37:34.254 --> 37:36.324
We don't like the job you're doing.

37:36.324 --> 37:40.284
This Movement needs a
leader, or it will fall apart.

37:40.284 --> 37:41.374
The Movement has a leader.

37:41.374 --> 37:44.354
A leader who's dying.

37:44.354 --> 37:47.284
- There will be a miracle.
- Well, great, great.

37:47.284 --> 37:49.324
You go down to Peru,
wait for the miracle.

37:49.324 --> 37:51.294
I'll take care of things up here.

37:51.294 --> 37:53.254
Meyerism is in all of us.

37:53.254 --> 37:54.374
That's when there were six members.

37:54.374 --> 37:56.274
Now there are 6,000.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.464
The last three rungs
will tell us what to do.

37:58.464 --> 38:01.254
He'll die before they're done,

38:01.254 --> 38:03.334
and there is no plan in place.

38:03.334 --> 38:05.424
There's nothing.

38:05.424 --> 38:10.364
So... I'm writing the last three rungs.

38:10.364 --> 38:12.364
That is not your place.

38:12.364 --> 38:14.424
Why was it Steve's
place in Cusco in 1974?

38:14.424 --> 38:16.384
Because The Light came to him.

38:16.384 --> 38:19.274
- And now it's come to me.
- That is not the way it works.

38:19.274 --> 38:22.294
My hands didn't burn on a story.

38:22.294 --> 38:24.464
They burned on a blazing
hot Ladder of Truth.

38:24.464 --> 38:26.384
I know... no, I know.

38:26.384 --> 38:27.464
I know. You're right.

38:27.464 --> 38:30.344
Something happened... a miracle

38:30.344 --> 38:32.324
that made all this possible,

38:32.324 --> 38:34.354
and it is beautiful.

38:34.354 --> 38:37.484
It truly is, and it is saving lives.

38:37.484 --> 38:39.394
But it has also bought you

38:39.394 --> 38:42.284
a very nice five-bedroom
house in San Diego.

38:42.284 --> 38:44.454
It pays the bills for your
four kids, your seven grandkids.

38:44.454 --> 38:46.314
No, no. Wait, wait.

38:46.314 --> 38:50.364
What happens to them
if it all goes away?

38:53.294 --> 38:56.254
The Movement is all we have.

38:59.254 --> 39:02.464
We all made sacrifices.

39:02.464 --> 39:04.444
And I won't walk away.

39:04.444 --> 39:06.464
No one is asking you to walk away, Cal.

39:06.464 --> 39:09.364
We're telling you to move to the side.

39:10.364 --> 39:13.264
You are not up for this.

39:15.404 --> 39:17.374
Not with Alison Kemp running around.

39:17.374 --> 39:20.264
And now Miranda Frank

39:20.264 --> 39:22.454
in her footsteps.

39:22.454 --> 39:25.414
We know she isn't in the hospital, Cal.

39:28.384 --> 39:31.294
Is that what you're worried about?

39:55.294 --> 39:58.404
I feel so light...

39:58.404 --> 39:59.474
and grateful to Cal

39:59.474 --> 40:03.264
for getting me out of the hospital.

40:03.264 --> 40:05.454
They just want to fill you
with their wicked drugs.

40:10.364 --> 40:13.274
I'm really sorry for what I did.

40:15.384 --> 40:17.404
I hope that Sarah and
Eddie and their children

40:17.404 --> 40:18.414
are able to forgive me.

40:18.414 --> 40:21.414
Of course they are.

40:21.414 --> 40:25.374
They have nothing but love
in their hearts for you.

40:28.394 --> 40:30.334
Good.

40:32.424 --> 40:34.454
I'm so grateful to
be a part of something

40:34.454 --> 40:38.274
where healing and
forgiveness are so important.

40:56.394 --> 40:59.364
That's why Steve put me in charge.

41:02.334 --> 41:04.364
You may have known him longer,

41:04.364 --> 41:08.474
but I have The Gift.

41:08.474 --> 41:11.284
Oh, you can inspire the faithful,

41:11.284 --> 41:15.484
but you don't have what I have.

41:15.484 --> 41:19.344
I can walk out on the fucking street

41:19.344 --> 41:24.264
and make people believe.

41:28.264 --> 41:33.324
So... I'm writing the last three rungs,

41:33.324 --> 41:35.484
and they'll say that I'm the chosen son.

41:38.324 --> 41:41.284
I'll let you know when they're finished.

41:41.284 --> 41:45.434
Maybe you'll want to
come back out again.

41:49.484 --> 41:52.474
You'll never get Silas on board.

42:00.254 --> 42:02.444
Silas will meet you at
the airport, all right?

42:02.444 --> 42:06.304
He's an amazing man and
one of my dearest friends.

42:06.304 --> 42:09.264
He's gonna help you
to get Freddie better.

42:09.264 --> 42:10.474
I don't know if I can do this.

42:10.474 --> 42:11.484
We don't even have our things.

42:11.484 --> 42:13.334
You don't need anything.

42:13.334 --> 42:15.434
You just need your son alive.

42:15.434 --> 42:18.464
My husband's gonna kill me.

42:18.464 --> 42:21.344
You're doing the right thing, Kerry.

42:53.474 --> 42:57.474
Wash away your sins

43:01.384 --> 43:04.384
You don't know where they've been

43:09.344 --> 43:12.284
I want to be a better man

43:12.284 --> 43:14.404
You were so brave today.

43:14.404 --> 43:17.274
- I was so scared.
- No, it was beautiful.

43:17.274 --> 43:18.304
Well, I'm doing the best I can

43:18.304 --> 43:20.424
You're beautiful.

43:20.424 --> 43:25.334
I hate that those
things happened to you.

43:25.334 --> 43:27.414
But I'll protect you.

43:27.414 --> 43:32.334
I promise.

43:32.334 --> 43:36.254
Well, I'm doing the best I can

43:55.434 --> 43:59.254
Well, now I'm starting to fear the worst

44:03.354 --> 44:07.454
And I wonder what happened first

44:10.284 --> 44:11.484
You're right.

44:11.484 --> 44:14.314
The problems in my head

44:14.314 --> 44:15.314
Something's wrong.

44:16.444 --> 44:19.274
I'll take her to a specialist.

44:19.274 --> 44:23.284
Or all the things I left unsaid

44:27.344 --> 44:30.444
I want to be a better man

44:34.454 --> 44:38.334
Well, I'm doing the best I can

44:38.334 --> 44:42.484
Oh, Lord

44:42.484 --> 44:46.404
I want to be a better man

44:46.404 --> 44:48.374
But, like, I sang it
first. He was trying to see,

44:48.374 --> 44:50.364
make sure I was hitting
the same note as her.

44:50.364 --> 44:54.264
Well, I'm doing the best I can

44:57.414 --> 45:03.304
Well, I don't know where I'm gonna go

45:05.484 --> 45:08.464
You actually came.

45:08.464 --> 45:10.304
Yeah.

45:10.304 --> 45:12.334
Aren't you gonna get in trouble?

45:12.334 --> 45:14.334
Yeah.

45:21.464 --> 45:27.284
I want to be a better man

45:27.284 --> 45:31.264
Hey-ey-ey

45:31.264 --> 45:34.284
Oh, Lord

45:37.414 --> 45:42.364
I'm doing the best I can

45:42.364 --> 45:49.294
Yeah-eah
oh-ohh, Lord

45:49.294 --> 45:52.264
Doing the best I can

45:54.444 --> 45:56.404
Hey.

45:56.404 --> 45:57.484
Hey.

45:57.484 --> 46:00.304
I just wanted to say good-bye.

46:00.304 --> 46:03.284
Ah, sorry it was such a short trip.

46:08.404 --> 46:09.464
Always good seeing you two.

46:09.464 --> 46:11.454
Oh, you too.

46:11.454 --> 46:13.414
Mm.

46:13.414 --> 46:15.324
Hey, listen.

46:15.324 --> 46:17.304
Any word on Miranda?

46:24.384 --> 46:26.394
I'm sorry, Eddie.

46:26.394 --> 46:29.294
Please tell Sarah how sorry I am.

46:29.294 --> 46:31.314
She's gonna head up outreach for us.

46:31.314 --> 46:32.384
Yeah.

46:32.384 --> 46:34.324
I'm psyched.

46:34.324 --> 46:37.424
I've always wanted to transfer.

46:37.424 --> 46:39.404
The weather.

46:41.454 --> 46:43.374
Keep the faith, honey.

46:43.374 --> 46:46.324
And watch Cal for us, will you?

47:46.374 --> 47:48.364
Welcome to 7R.

47:52.324 --> 47:54.304
Start digging.

47:57.364 --> 48:01.344
You just want me to dig?

48:01.344 --> 48:04.334
Dig until you find something.
