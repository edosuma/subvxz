00:26.789 --> 00:28.617
...for a job well done.

00:42.718 --> 00:43.689
Grandma...

00:44.203 --> 00:46.516
- Who's that?
- Hi, Grandma.

00:47.276 --> 00:49.995
It's me, Grandma. It's Allison.

00:50.549 --> 00:52.543
Allison?!

00:53.347 --> 00:57.382
Allison...Oh, my gosh!

00:57.383 --> 00:59.878
Look at you! You're all grown up.

01:00.032 --> 01:02.641
So amazing to see you, Grandma.

01:02.874 --> 01:05.022
So pretty, hmm?

01:05.036 --> 01:07.541
Always so pretty.

01:12.330 --> 01:15.140
Everything is just the
way I remember it.

01:15.173 --> 01:17.756
Of course it is. Why wouldn't it be?

01:18.355 --> 01:20.088
Everything is as it is,

01:20.276 --> 01:23.762
everything is as it must be,
at this moment.

01:24.546 --> 01:28.781
Mm, you know, you look good.
You look happy.

01:28.827 --> 01:30.483
I am happy.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.091
I have a wonderful family.

01:33.177 --> 01:36.862
A wonderful life. Three girls...

01:36.868 --> 01:39.443
Ariel, Bridgette and Marie.

01:40.666 --> 01:44.023
Grandma Benoit, you old witch, you.

01:44.027 --> 01:45.863
Oh, don't "old witch" me.

01:45.917 --> 01:50.240
You've got some Benoit, too.
I know that.

01:50.795 --> 01:52.821
Oh, how's John?

01:53.117 --> 01:54.233
John?

01:54.235 --> 01:56.713
John Dunham, your husband.

01:56.718 --> 01:58.512
The love of your life.

02:01.165 --> 02:04.303
Oh, shh, it's coming up a storm.

02:05.157 --> 02:06.520
Grandma...

02:07.197 --> 02:10.240
The two of you should've
been back hours ago.

02:10.245 --> 02:11.620
I'm sorry. Who?

02:11.628 --> 02:14.461
You, that's who.
You and that Dunham boy.

02:16.157 --> 02:17.651
Wait a second...

02:20.786 --> 02:23.062
This is all really familiar.

02:23.836 --> 02:26.352
The thunder, the storm...

02:27.505 --> 02:29.510
I remember today.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.953
We rode our bikes
to the swimming quarry.

02:32.955 --> 02:35.870
We got soaked on our
way back and then...

02:36.138 --> 02:38.160
And then what?

02:38.365 --> 02:41.253
I haven't the foggiest notion
what you're saying, dear.

02:45.925 --> 02:48.681
You remember, Grandma: My... my arm.

02:48.867 --> 02:54.020
We were coming up the front walk, we saw
the smoke coming out of the kitchen window...

02:55.946 --> 02:59.250
Oh, my gosh, I have a pie in the oven.

03:01.157 --> 03:02.270
It was today.

03:02.286 --> 03:04.192
It was minutes from right now.

03:04.368 --> 03:07.011
You were fast asleep,
I ran in to pull out the pie,

03:07.026 --> 03:09.483
I burned myself on the oven rack.

03:09.485 --> 03:12.282
Well, we can't have that.

03:12.285 --> 03:16.532
I can't have my granddaughter
spend the next 70 years scarred.

03:16.535 --> 03:17.802
No, no, no!

03:17.955 --> 03:19.730
Now, we're going to have
to leave right now,

03:19.736 --> 03:22.281
so I can wake up and get
that pie out of the oven.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.941
I'm not really here, Grandma.

03:23.946 --> 03:26.450
You're not really here.
This is a dream.

03:27.057 --> 03:29.160
You're talking nonsense, dear.

03:29.167 --> 03:32.063
Now, don't you worry,
I can take care of everything.

03:32.065 --> 03:33.842
But, right now, you have to go.

03:38.026 --> 03:39.820
It was so vivid, Joe.

03:40.756 --> 03:43.621
Like I was really there. Have you
ever had a dream like that?

03:43.666 --> 03:46.153
I dreamt I went to Hawaii once, 
and when I woke up,

03:46.155 --> 03:49.402
I could've sworn that I had a better
tan than when I went to sleep.

03:51.835 --> 03:54.042
Maybe I should've married
Johnny Dunham.

03:54.527 --> 03:58.251
Lucky for you, that was the last
summer I spent at Grandma's.

03:58.255 --> 04:00.070
Had I gone back the next year...

04:00.075 --> 04:05.380
Hmm... Who knows? Things
might've been very different.

04:07.078 --> 04:09.253
Aren't you even the least bit jealous?

04:09.435 --> 04:11.680
About this Johnny Dunham character?

04:11.687 --> 04:15.081
Absolutely. It's all I can
do to eat this bagel.

04:17.277 --> 04:20.272
Mom? Who's driving us?

04:20.286 --> 04:22.081
Because I told Hannah
I'd meet her early,

04:22.084 --> 04:24.290
so we can go over our
history presentation.

04:24.977 --> 04:26.671
And you're telling us this now?

04:26.676 --> 04:28.091
I forgot. I'm sorry,

04:28.095 --> 04:30.573
but this thing counts for,
like, a third of my grade.

04:30.977 --> 04:33.523
Well, get your sisters ready,
I'll drop you off on the way to work.

04:35.575 --> 04:38.703
Well... I never thought
I'd say this, but

04:38.725 --> 04:41.802
part of me is looking forward to her
getting her driver's license.

04:43.276 --> 04:45.151
God, the sound of that rain...

04:47.676 --> 04:50.851
It rained so hard that afternoon,
all the roads flooded.

04:52.405 --> 04:55.102
Took us a half an hour
to get to the hospital.

04:55.107 --> 04:56.190
The hospital?

04:57.845 --> 04:59.641
It was the day I burned myself.

05:00.637 --> 05:03.210
You know, on my arm...
that big, dark patch.

05:03.368 --> 05:04.703
Huh?

05:05.318 --> 05:09.130
You know, right there... you can still
see where the metal touched.

05:10.357 --> 05:11.902
I don't see anything.

05:12.598 --> 05:14.412
I've honestly never noticed it.

05:14.907 --> 05:18.003
Where did it go? That's so weird.

05:18.675 --> 05:20.720
Kind of like Johnny Dunham.

05:21.338 --> 05:23.742
Must've just faded away.

06:08.976 --> 06:11.001
Keep your eye on Juror Number Three.

06:11.006 --> 06:14.761
During deliberations, the others are going 
to listen very closely to what she has to say.

06:14.776 --> 06:15.812
Number Three?!

06:17.018 --> 06:18.460
If I remember correctly,

06:18.585 --> 06:21.191
she was one of Larry Watt's choices.

06:21.207 --> 06:23.261
He believes she's gonna vote to acquit.

06:23.507 --> 06:25.361
Her father did some jail time
when she was young,

06:25.365 --> 06:27.262
for, of course, a crime he didn't commit.

06:27.276 --> 06:28.101
Of course.

06:28.108 --> 06:29.881
Now, Watt thinks he has
her in his pocket,

06:29.886 --> 06:31.782
but  the truth is, she's up for grabs.

06:31.898 --> 06:34.781
So, you get to her, the jury's
gonna vote your way.

06:35.746 --> 06:37.960
Doesn't seem fair, does it?

06:37.975 --> 06:39.230
What's that?

06:39.728 --> 06:41.140
Having you on my team.

06:41.155 --> 06:43.760
Sometimes I think it isn't
fair to the other side.

06:48.077 --> 06:49.552
Well, that's my daughter.

06:49.805 --> 06:51.010
Hey, baby.

06:51.807 --> 06:54.303
Ariel, slow down.
I can't understand you.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.793
You left what in the car?

06:59.268 --> 07:01.742
Now?  Well, I'm with my boss.

07:01.747 --> 07:03.282
He's about to go into court.

07:03.995 --> 07:05.592
I know it's a third of your grade,

07:05.596 --> 07:07.653
but I'm not the one
who left it in the car.

07:07.655 --> 07:08.640
Go...

07:09.157 --> 07:11.503
I'm appreciate the moral
support, but I'm fine.

07:11.506 --> 07:14.743
Ariel, I'll be there in a
half an hour. Love you.

07:14.748 --> 07:17.262
And I bet you were looking forward
to my opening statement, weren't you?

07:17.277 --> 07:18.563
Actually, I was.

07:21.318 --> 07:25.441
Imelda Vizcaina grew up in a remote
town in the mountains of El Salvador...

07:26.975 --> 07:29.522
a town so small it had no electricity.

07:30.407 --> 07:31.813
There was nothing small, however,

07:31.816 --> 07:34.941
about this young woman's hopes
and dreams for a better life.

07:35.608 --> 07:38.762
And it was those very hopes
and dreams that the defendant,

07:38.766 --> 07:43.022
Sean Redburn, so cruelly exploited
when he lured her to this country

07:43.207 --> 07:47.022
with the promise of a job...
 ...of a better life.

07:48.838 --> 07:51.742
What she found when she got
here was something quite different.

07:52.037 --> 07:54.943
What she found was a man who
was sexually obsessed with her,

07:55.068 --> 07:58.021
a man bent on controlling
her every move...

07:58.856 --> 08:03.220
a man willing to use threats of
deportation, threats of violence,

08:03.225 --> 08:05.313
and even the threat of death...

08:06.256 --> 08:08.282
to keep her under his thrall.

08:10.016 --> 08:12.862
Over the next few days,
we will present

08:13.037 --> 08:16.542
overwhelming evidence that
Mr. Redburn murdered

08:16.545 --> 08:18.752
Ms. Vizcaina in a fit of anger,

08:19.458 --> 08:21.832
using a knife taken
from her own kitchen.

08:22.286 --> 08:24.261
We will present evidence of motive,

08:24.367 --> 08:27.201
evidence of means,
and evidence of opportunity.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.311
What we will not present,
what we cannot present,

08:30.318 --> 08:32.159
is Ms. Vizcaina's body.

08:34.126 --> 08:37.121
The defense will undoubtedly
make much of this fact.

08:37.138 --> 08:39.120
No body, no crime.

08:39.388 --> 08:42.201
You're going to hear that
over and over again,

08:42.206 --> 08:44.241
but it's simply not true.

08:45.070 --> 08:47.830
The absence of a corpse does
not mean there was no murder,

08:47.843 --> 08:51.176
it simply means that the
murderer did his job well,

08:51.445 --> 08:55.578
and his lawyer would have you reward
him for that with an acquittal.

08:56.886 --> 08:59.353
I would ask you to look
at it as evidence

08:59.358 --> 09:02.440
of the cold and calculated
nature of his crime.

09:03.037 --> 09:04.682
You can right this wrong.

09:04.696 --> 09:06.353
You can give her justice.

09:08.686 --> 09:10.082
Thank you.

09:13.286 --> 09:15.552
Mr. Watt, do you have
any opening remarks?

09:15.565 --> 09:17.060
I do, Your Honor.

09:21.338 --> 09:22.750
Ladies and gentlemen.

09:25.437 --> 09:29.140
To be honest, I'm mystified
why District Attorney Devalos

09:29.158 --> 09:31.330
has even brought this case to trial.

09:31.336 --> 09:32.801
Now, why do I say that?

09:33.007 --> 09:34.263
Let's start with the fact

09:34.267 --> 09:37.653
that the investigation into the
murder of Imelda Vizcaina

09:37.655 --> 09:41.170
has never resulted in
the discovery of a body.

09:41.178 --> 09:42.752
Let me say that again.

09:43.036 --> 09:46.101
There is no body.

09:46.626 --> 09:48.203
And why?

09:48.206 --> 09:51.390
Because  there was no crime.

09:52.038 --> 09:57.990
Frankly, the only crime is
to my client's reputation.

09:58.375 --> 10:01.713
And the perpetrator
is the D.A. himself.

10:02.557 --> 10:05.612
As to what his motive might be,
I can only speculate...

10:05.616 --> 10:06.841
All right, Mr. Watt.

10:06.845 --> 10:08.530
Mr. Devalos is not on trial here.

10:08.535 --> 10:11.040
I apologize, Your Honor.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.512
It's just that it makes me angry.

10:13.856 --> 10:17.512
Makes me angry that the state
would spend the taxpayers' money

10:17.517 --> 10:21.502
prosecuting a crime that I don't
believe was ever committed.

10:22.336 --> 10:25.613
Why leap to the conclusion
that someone is dead

10:25.618 --> 10:27.981
if you haven't ruled
out the possibility

10:27.985 --> 10:31.123
that they just went somewhere
without telling anyone.

10:31.335 --> 10:32.982
Did anyone check?

10:32.988 --> 10:36.932
Did anyone try to find out
where Ms. Vizcaina might've gone?

10:37.367 --> 10:41.202
For all we know, she decided to leave
this country and go back home

10:41.206 --> 10:47.000
to the remote mountain town that the
district attorney so poetically described.

10:47.005 --> 10:49.843
Now, it wouldn't be easy to
track her down there, but,

10:50.616 --> 10:54.442
if someone tried, who knows
what they might discover.

10:55.347 --> 10:59.291
I should know because
that's exactly what I did.

10:59.327 --> 11:00.660
I tried.

11:02.007 --> 11:05.103
And you'll never
guess what I found.

11:06.845 --> 11:08.650
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

11:08.657 --> 11:13.261
may I present to you Imelda Vizcaina.

11:32.016 --> 11:33.763
Alive? That's impossible.

11:33.766 --> 11:34.643
Apparently not.

11:34.647 --> 11:36.813
But what about the missing kitchen knife?

11:37.238 --> 11:38.331
What about the blood?

11:38.337 --> 11:39.912
- What about...
- She's alive, Allison.

11:39.916 --> 11:40.903
I saw her with my own eyes.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.470
- She's alive.
- She can't be.

11:42.477 --> 11:44.940
But she is.
We prosecuted an innocent man.

11:44.958 --> 11:47.070
The evidence didn't mean
what we thought it meant.

11:47.158 --> 11:49.310
We got it wrong. All of it.

11:51.138 --> 11:53.081
I'm so sorry, sir.

11:53.205 --> 11:54.842
I based this case on
what you told me, Allison.

11:54.848 --> 11:56.271
You told me Imelda Vizcaina was dead.

11:56.277 --> 11:59.150
You told me she was
sending you dreams.

12:00.185 --> 12:01.812
I thought she was.

12:06.758 --> 12:08.171
We have another problem.

12:10.167 --> 12:13.812
After the judge dismissed the case,
Attorney Watt held a press conference.

12:14.337 --> 12:18.392
He insinuated that the reason
I went ahead with this prosecution,

12:18.398 --> 12:20.483
the reason I insisted
on bringing it to trial,

12:21.107 --> 12:23.610
is because I have
a psychic in my employ.

12:23.615 --> 12:26.002
A woman who talks to the dead.
A woman who...

12:26.137 --> 12:27.861
sees things in her dreams.

12:27.867 --> 12:29.103
Oh, no.

12:29.108 --> 12:30.860
People are starting to
ask questions, Allison.

12:32.325 --> 12:34.741
Oh, she's still here.

12:34.985 --> 12:37.400
Give us another minute, please.

12:37.957 --> 12:40.143
All right, but we do need
to get ahead of this thing.

12:42.166 --> 12:45.651
The Deputy Mayor is here because
she's hearing what I'm hearing.

12:45.846 --> 12:49.282
We're about to be hit by a
dozen or so Motions to Dismiss.

12:49.807 --> 12:51.761
I'm not sure I'm following you.

12:51.766 --> 12:53.851
Every defense lawyer
in town is trying to find out

12:53.867 --> 12:56.983
if "my psychic" had anything
to do with convicting their client.

12:56.988 --> 13:01.180
Every case I've prosecuted for the past two
years is going to be re-opened and re-examined.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.702
And there's a very real
possibility when it's all over,

13:03.708 --> 13:07.581
some very bad guys are going to be
handed get-out-of-jail-free cards.

13:08.065 --> 13:09.513
Mr. District Attorney...

13:09.518 --> 13:13.493
Allison, I'm fairly certain that the mayor
is going to ask for my resignation.

13:13.925 --> 13:15.731
The one thing he's already
made abundantly clear

13:15.735 --> 13:20.381
is our professional association,
yours and mine, needs to end.

13:21.016 --> 13:24.593
Today. Here. Now.

13:35.868 --> 13:36.941
Al...

13:38.297 --> 13:39.663
What did you do?

13:40.108 --> 13:41.920
What is going on?

13:43.827 --> 13:47.903
That phone has been ringing off
the hook for the past 45 minutes.

13:47.908 --> 13:49.260
Don't answer that.

13:50.878 --> 13:52.822
Reporters calling and lawyers calling.

13:52.827 --> 13:55.230
I keep seeing strange cars driving by.

13:55.385 --> 13:58.943
Mom, Hannah just e-mailed me there
are people are making fun of you on TV.

14:00.157 --> 14:01.173
Mom.  Dad.

14:01.176 --> 14:04.423
I just looked out the window and
saw some people out on the lawn.

14:08.837 --> 14:10.361
Should I answer the door, Daddy?

14:10.368 --> 14:12.600
Al... No. Come here.

14:22.978 --> 14:27.392
Al, hey. Whatever it is,
we'll figure it out.

14:31.756 --> 14:34.633
Is the Gypsy there?
The fortune teller?

14:37.277 --> 14:39.081
I  always believed

14:40.056 --> 14:44.210
that I heard the voices,
I dreamed the dreams, for a reason.

14:44.846 --> 14:46.721
I didn't even want it.

14:46.958 --> 14:48.953
I wanted to be a lawyer.

14:48.978 --> 14:51.033
I know, but it's not like
you had a choice.

14:51.326 --> 14:52.702
But I did.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.352
Couple of drinks...

14:55.558 --> 14:57.541
no more voices.

14:58.187 --> 15:00.213
No more dead people.

15:00.658 --> 15:02.430
No more dreams.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.722
Stupid...

15:06.948 --> 15:10.340
I could have drank my way
into a really great life.

15:11.868 --> 15:14.470
And I should have.

15:19.275 --> 15:22.562
Well, I'm gonna take care of the kids,
so I'm gonna call the police,

15:22.568 --> 15:26.072
and if you want me to bring you a bottle
of gin with a nipple on it, you just holler.

15:57.545 --> 15:59.151
Ally.

16:00.135 --> 16:01.813
Ally Baba.

16:04.918 --> 16:07.342
That's Ally Dunham to you.

16:08.928 --> 16:10.352
Time to get up.

16:13.685 --> 16:15.960
Oh, Johnny, do I have to?

16:16.547 --> 16:19.241
This is why we're never
going to have children.

16:59.386 --> 17:02.023
I had the strangest
dream last night.

17:02.656 --> 17:04.332
Hmm. What's that?

17:04.338 --> 17:06.142
I think we had kids.

17:06.944 --> 17:11.713
You were upset about something,
and you were going to get me some gin.

17:12.058 --> 17:13.291
Okay.

17:19.848 --> 17:21.642
What's on the docket for today?

17:22.444 --> 17:24.329
Uh, Redburn case.

17:25.577 --> 17:27.902
Seems like you been working
on that thing forever.

17:28.458 --> 17:30.421
When's it finally go to trial?

17:30.657 --> 17:33.513
Opening statements are
in three days unless...

17:33.626 --> 17:34.963
Unless what?

17:35.396 --> 17:37.432
District attorney wants to meet at 9:00.

17:37.437 --> 17:40.372
I'm guessing it's to talk about
cutting a deal with Redburn,

17:40.637 --> 17:42.540
avoiding a trial altogether.

17:42.988 --> 17:45.201
You think Watt will agree
to take a deal?

17:45.765 --> 17:49.470
Larry Watt can't wait to get
this case before a jury.

17:49.625 --> 17:52.011
What about you,
what's your day like?

17:52.127 --> 17:53.240
Pretty light.

17:53.247 --> 17:54.781
Morning meeting with the board,

17:55.407 --> 17:57.772
then I'm having lunch with Tom Fenton

17:57.778 --> 18:00.540
to discuss broadening
his investment portfolio.

18:01.168 --> 18:03.403
Didn't you tell me he was
on his way to Europe?

18:04.647 --> 18:06.593
That must have been
your other husband.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.311
I'm having lunch with
Fenton at Varium at One.

18:09.947 --> 18:14.192
I don't know, I could've sworn I heard
you say that he was out of town.

18:22.587 --> 18:24.090
Mr. District Attorney?

18:26.286 --> 18:27.922
I'm sorry?

18:28.455 --> 18:30.213
Allison Dunham.

18:30.785 --> 18:32.393
I work with Larry Watt.

18:32.838 --> 18:34.311
Junior partner.

18:34.795 --> 18:36.750
Mr. Watt asked me to
extend his apologies--

18:36.756 --> 18:38.463
he won't be able to make
the meeting today.

18:38.465 --> 18:40.213
He asked me to take his place.

18:42.266 --> 18:47.203
Everybody at your firm understands that
I intend to prosecute this case vigorously.

18:47.205 --> 18:49.112
I intend to pursue the death penalty.

18:49.115 --> 18:50.503
I think you'll discover soon enough

18:50.508 --> 18:54.483
that everyone at our firm has a precise
grasp on exactly what you're up to...

18:54.505 --> 18:56.340
Mr. District Attorney.

18:56.357 --> 18:59.041
Be that as it may, Ms. Dunham,
I'm more than a little surprised

18:59.045 --> 19:02.223
that Larry Watt would choose not
to attend this meeting himself,

19:02.225 --> 19:04.383
much less send a junior partner.

19:05.596 --> 19:07.051
If it makes you feel better,

19:07.066 --> 19:09.983
I am certain I will be made
a full partner soon enough.

19:10.355 --> 19:11.261
And for what it's worth,

19:11.276 --> 19:16.191
I think the fact that Mr.
Watt sent a junior partner in his stead

19:16.195 --> 19:20.143
speaks more to his opinion of your
case than it does his opinion of me.

19:20.506 --> 19:21.620
Really.

19:21.666 --> 19:22.981
Absolutely.

19:25.257 --> 19:27.702
So now that we've gotten
to know each other,

19:27.975 --> 19:29.640
let me tell you why I'm here.

19:29.965 --> 19:32.733
I know that your evidence
against Mr. Redburn is weak.

19:32.738 --> 19:36.333
You certainly wouldn't have called my
office unless you wanted to discuss a deal.

19:36.336 --> 19:38.562
So let's hear it, Mr. District Attorney.

19:38.568 --> 19:40.682
What exactly are you willing to offer?

19:40.986 --> 19:42.313
First-degree manslaughter,

19:42.318 --> 19:45.552
eight to 12 years with the
possibility of parole after five.

19:45.757 --> 19:48.850
Why would we accept manslaughter?
You don't even have a body.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.183
We have a murder weapon.

19:50.187 --> 19:51.593
You have an alleged murder weapon.

19:51.598 --> 19:54.531
Smeared with the blood of the young
woman your client murdered.

19:54.535 --> 19:55.801
Really.

19:55.856 --> 20:00.532
Last I checked, the blood on that knife
was too degenerated to extract any DNA.

20:00.805 --> 20:05.023
All that you have is a blood type,
and a very common type at that.

20:05.138 --> 20:07.930
You certainly can't connect it
conclusively to the missing woman,

20:07.936 --> 20:10.091
and you can't connect
it to Mr. Redburn.

20:10.097 --> 20:12.832
Hell, you can't even prove he ever
stepped foot in her apartment.

20:12.835 --> 20:16.581
Because you know and I know that he
wiped the whole place down with bleach.

20:16.585 --> 20:19.830
We can't even find the victim's
prints in her own apartment.

20:21.197 --> 20:26.392
Fine. You want to argue that Imelda Vizcaina
vanished into thin air, be my guest.

20:26.395 --> 20:28.432
I'm just not sure that
the jury's gonna buy it.

20:29.846 --> 20:30.973
I think they might.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.611
Whatever you say, Ms. Dunham.

20:33.956 --> 20:37.052
Please let Larry Watt know
that this is a one-time offer,

20:37.176 --> 20:39.743
and it expires at midnight tonight.

20:40.758 --> 20:42.832
-To reasonable doubt. 
- Reasonable doubt.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.212
So, you know what I think?

20:48.788 --> 20:53.180
I think if Manny Devalos is proposing deals like
the one he tried to sell you on this morning,

20:53.346 --> 20:55.592
he's worried his case isn't strong enough.

20:55.595 --> 20:58.333
Well, he should be... he's trying
to prosecute an innocent man.

20:58.338 --> 21:00.102
Well, you may know that 
and I may know that,

21:00.115 --> 21:02.680
but our job is to convince a jury.

21:02.906 --> 21:06.441
Which is why I wish we had something 
better to rebut this knife business with.

21:06.448 --> 21:07.813
I've been thinking about that.

21:07.815 --> 21:10.853
I'm meeting with a potential expert
witness about it this afternoon.

21:10.856 --> 21:12.053
Tell me.

21:12.917 --> 21:15.110
Let me see how it pans out first.

21:17.607 --> 21:19.503
Quinton, Vanessa, stop it.

21:20.586 --> 21:22.052
There ought to be a law.

21:23.085 --> 21:25.383
If it isn't my handsome husband.

21:25.666 --> 21:27.961
Your handsome husband who's
trolling for a lunch date.

21:27.968 --> 21:29.192
What happened to Tom Fenton?

21:29.195 --> 21:31.561
Well, he had to jet off
to Europe, apparently.

21:31.775 --> 21:33.392
- That's weird.
- Hmm?

21:34.458 --> 21:36.141
- I hope I'm not interrupting.
- What I said this morning.

21:36.178 --> 21:38.650
No, come on, join us...
we haven't even ordered yet.

21:39.295 --> 21:40.983
Listen,  if you two need to talk shop...

21:40.986 --> 21:42.120
No, not at all.

21:43.447 --> 21:45.371
Hey, guys, wait till we're in the car.

21:46.227 --> 21:46.860
Lovely children.

21:55.017 --> 21:56.580
Be careful what you wish for.

21:57.987 --> 22:00.552
I'm not wishing for anything. Not yet.

22:01.055 --> 22:03.000
Maybe after I make partner.

22:03.467 --> 22:04.893
If then.

22:08.405 --> 22:10.291
So, how long have,
you two been married?

22:10.696 --> 22:12.213
12 years this spring.

22:12.217 --> 22:14.262
We were college sweethearts,
very boring.

22:14.265 --> 22:15.430
Boring?

22:15.565 --> 22:18.773
Honey... we were brought
together by fate.

22:18.785 --> 22:20.651
The stars aligned for us.

22:20.667 --> 22:22.441
That's what your grandmother said.

22:23.285 --> 22:25.880
Your grandmother sounds like
a remarkable woman.

22:26.415 --> 22:28.700
More like the town eccentric, actually.

22:30.346 --> 22:33.723
Well, I don't know, I-I guess people
thought she was a little odd.

22:33.737 --> 22:35.373
She trusted her instincts.

22:36.195 --> 22:39.342
She heard... voices.

22:39.735 --> 22:41.983
She'd get messages in her sleep.

22:41.986 --> 22:44.143
She was the town eccentric.

22:44.705 --> 22:46.893
In a very small town.

22:49.855 --> 22:52.542
Every time I move my chair,
everything goes all fritzy.

22:53.838 --> 22:55.160
Any calls?

22:55.495 --> 22:57.013
Uh, Paul Haas returned,

22:57.016 --> 22:59.762
Jamie Mandlebaum called to say
he's in court and unreachable,

22:59.765 --> 23:02.271
and your Pilates instructor needs
to reschedule tomorrow.

23:02.275 --> 23:04.010
Fine. What about my 2:00?

23:04.585 --> 23:08.260
It's five after. What is he, one of
those absent-minded professors?

23:11.085 --> 23:13.850
Actually, I've been
here since ten of.

23:13.855 --> 23:16.122
I'm just doing my
part to fight fritz.

23:18.167 --> 23:21.542
My firm's handling the Sean Redburn case.
Are you familiar with it?

23:21.755 --> 23:24.770
Rich contractor stabbed his
immigrant mistress to death.

23:24.775 --> 23:26.160
It's been on the news a lot.

23:26.507 --> 23:27.790
Allegedly.

23:27.805 --> 23:29.470
It's allegedly been on the news?

23:29.477 --> 23:32.033
No, I'm fairly certain coverage
has been ubiquitous.

23:32.038 --> 23:34.640
No, he allegedly committed a murder.

23:34.645 --> 23:37.071
We intend to prove that
he's been wrongly accused.

23:37.555 --> 23:39.802
Don't the police have a
knife with her blood on it?

23:40.735 --> 23:42.150
They found a knife in that dump

23:42.155 --> 23:45.502
that happens to be the same brand
and style as the set she owned,

23:45.506 --> 23:47.511
and there were microscopic traces

23:47.515 --> 23:50.640
that match her very
common blood type, yes.

23:51.017 --> 23:52.682
I heard somebody saw
them having an argument

23:52.685 --> 23:55.562
and she hasn't been
heard from since.

23:56.345 --> 23:58.870
You strike me as an
intelligent man, Mr. DuBois.

23:58.875 --> 24:01.632
Do you believe everything you
see and hear on the news?

24:01.915 --> 24:03.793
Couples fight.
I'm sure you and your wife...

24:03.807 --> 24:05.490
I'm not married.

24:05.676 --> 24:09.241
You should try it sometime.
I highly recommend it.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.882
Ah, see, but there's the problem.

24:10.885 --> 24:12.822
All the cool girls are taken.

24:16.578 --> 24:19.753
I see here you have a
Ph.D. in mathematics.

24:19.755 --> 24:21.230
Two, actually.

24:21.455 --> 24:23.331
Says here that you wrote a book.

24:23.535 --> 24:27.931
Ah, my scandalous expose about
the secret language of numbers.

24:28.526 --> 24:31.271
Well, if I may, I'd like to
run some numbers by you.

24:31.278 --> 24:33.752
Having to do with the knife
that you mentioned earlier.

24:34.727 --> 24:36.912
According to the city,

24:36.917 --> 24:41.293
the waste processing facility where it
was found serves 125,000 households.

24:41.787 --> 24:45.701
Now, apparently, the utensil in
question is a very common brand.

24:45.858 --> 24:47.781
According to the
manufacturer's website,

24:47.788 --> 24:50.121
it outsells its competition two to one.

24:50.445 --> 24:53.110
Well, if it says so on the
manufacturer's website.

24:53.938 --> 24:54.771
Work with me.

24:54.777 --> 24:57.192
These are just
back-of-the-envelope calculations.

24:57.278 --> 24:58.683
But if, let's say,

24:58.687 --> 25:02.592
ten percent of those 125,000
households use this brand--

25:02.675 --> 25:07.093
and household is defined by the census
as having four persons in it--

25:07.118 --> 25:10.970
we're talking about 50,000 people.

25:11.317 --> 25:13.710
Do you have any idea what percentage

25:13.726 --> 25:17.313
of the population has O-positive blood?

25:17.398 --> 25:19.722
No, but I have a feeling that 
you're going to tell me.

25:19.817 --> 25:21.633
Almost 40 percent.

25:22.148 --> 25:26.121
Which would mean the blood on that knife
could belong to any one of 20,000 people, no?

25:26.147 --> 25:29.993
Assuming your assumptions
hold up, I suppose so.

25:30.175 --> 25:33.402
How would like to earn
$1,500 for one day of work?

25:33.738 --> 25:35.360
Who do I have to kill?

25:35.635 --> 25:38.401
I need an expert witness
to explain all this to a jury.

25:38.717 --> 25:42.650
You want me to testify to your
back-of-the-envelope numbers?

25:44.036 --> 25:46.750
$2,500 plus expenses.

25:46.768 --> 25:47.981
What expenses?

25:47.985 --> 25:49.202
You need a new suit.

25:49.207 --> 25:50.341
I have a suit.

25:51.036 --> 25:53.213
I know that, but it's
almost eight years old.

25:53.877 --> 25:55.200
Excuse me?

25:55.975 --> 25:57.161
I'm sorry?

25:57.165 --> 25:59.772
My suit, you just said that my suit
was almost eight years old.

25:59.997 --> 26:05.700
I bought that suit for my father's
funeral seven...eight years ago.

26:05.985 --> 26:08.333
How could you possibly
have known that?

26:08.337 --> 26:09.831
Have you been spying on me?

26:09.835 --> 26:11.971
I don't know, the number
just popped into my head.

26:11.976 --> 26:14.090
Besides, you are a college professor.

26:14.095 --> 26:16.291
Why would you be spending 
money on new suits?

26:16.297 --> 26:19.912
No, I know, it's just that you were
so specific about how old it was.

26:20.577 --> 26:23.260
I'm thinking of a number
from one to ten.

26:23.278 --> 26:25.590
I'm sure you are, Dr. DuBois.

26:25.597 --> 26:28.321
I am offering you $3,000.

26:28.327 --> 26:31.210
All you have to do is tell 12
people what you just told me,

26:31.477 --> 26:35.831
that the odds that that knife came from
Imelda Vizcaina's apartment are 20,000 to one.

26:35.837 --> 26:37.991
I didn't tell you, you told me.

26:38.066 --> 26:40.711
Be that as it may. 
Run the numbers yourself.

26:40.717 --> 26:41.930
Make them your own.

26:41.935 --> 26:45.221
As long as the odds you come up with
are in the neighborhood of 10,000 to one,

26:45.226 --> 26:47.382
I'd very much like you to testify.

26:49.875 --> 26:54.213
Well, I could certainly use the $3,000.

26:56.127 --> 26:57.003
Um...

26:57.846 --> 26:59.842
could I just ask you a
question, Ms. Dunham?

27:00.448 --> 27:01.562
Of course.

27:02.105 --> 27:05.252
Assuming the numbers that we
discussed are even remotely accurate,

27:05.255 --> 27:09.242
why are the police so convinced that
the knife belonged to the missing woman?

27:09.457 --> 27:11.600
Unlucky coincidence, I'm afraid.

27:11.786 --> 27:13.003
How's that?

27:13.005 --> 27:15.270
Well, apparently, these knives
come in sets of four.

27:15.287 --> 27:18.353
When the police checked Imelda's apartment,
they could only find three.

27:18.868 --> 27:20.090
What do you think?

27:20.228 --> 27:22.771
- About what? - About that.

27:23.095 --> 27:26.972
You strike me a person
with great instincts.

27:27.398 --> 27:29.382
I'd just be curious to
know what you think.

27:31.747 --> 27:34.733
I think you certainly could use $3,000.

27:36.228 --> 27:38.952
And I suppose a new
suit couldn't hurt.

27:40.385 --> 27:42.223
It's nice to meet you, Ms. Dunham.

27:57.178 --> 27:58.720
Ooh. Sleepy.

28:02.996 --> 28:03.973
Night.

28:09.797 --> 28:11.480
Can you turn it down a little bit?

28:14.347 --> 28:16.942
I just want to finish this chapter.
It's for work.

28:17.808 --> 28:19.360
Yeah, whatever.

28:55.876 --> 28:57.521
I just can't seem to shake it.

28:57.528 --> 28:59.882
The blood, the knife, the body...

29:00.877 --> 29:05.462
Just seemed so... real.

29:08.397 --> 29:09.542
Don't look at me like that.

29:09.547 --> 29:11.171
You make me feel foolish.

29:11.548 --> 29:12.910
It is foolish.

29:13.498 --> 29:14.882
I know.

29:15.705 --> 29:19.103
Allison... you want to be
a great lawyer, right?

29:19.847 --> 29:22.782
Great lawyers keep
their eye on the prize.

29:23.106 --> 29:26.622
The prize in this case is successfully
representing your client.

29:26.736 --> 29:30.063
Dreaming about him committing the
crime of which he's been accused

29:30.068 --> 29:32.963
and then dwelling on it while you're
awake isn't going to help you do that.

29:32.965 --> 29:34.143
I know.

29:34.576 --> 29:37.611
But why would such a thing
even come into my head?

29:40.988 --> 29:42.353
I don't believe it.

29:42.368 --> 29:45.911
It's too perfect,
it is just too perfect.

29:46.297 --> 29:49.172
Hell, I'm looking right at it
and I still don't believe it.

29:49.676 --> 29:51.103
Where'd you find this?

29:51.106 --> 29:52.013
A friend.

29:52.015 --> 29:54.482
He's something of a connoisseur.

29:54.845 --> 29:57.583
Pokes around in a lot
of very obscure sites.

29:57.588 --> 29:58.753
Unbelievable.

30:03.596 --> 30:04.861
Excuse me.

30:05.287 --> 30:07.132
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

30:07.145 --> 30:08.930
No, not at all.
What can I help you with?

30:08.935 --> 30:11.500
Well, I'm meeting with that expert
witness I told you about.

30:11.507 --> 30:13.092
I was wondering if you
wanted to meet him.

30:13.098 --> 30:15.131
No, I can't.
Redburn's on his way in.

30:15.137 --> 30:18.373
Um, I'll look at your notes
when you're finished.

30:18.376 --> 30:19.950
You boys have fun.

30:22.097 --> 30:23.950
Keep what you just
showed me to yourself.

30:23.967 --> 30:26.283
But find this girl,
I don't care what it costs.

30:27.078 --> 30:29.550
I mean, hell, if she's willing
to do this for money...

30:30.157 --> 30:32.310
I just want her here by
the time we get to trial.

30:36.465 --> 30:38.991
So as a doctor of
mathematics,Mr. Dubois,

30:39.117 --> 30:41.921
what in your expert opinion, 
would you say are the odds

30:41.925 --> 30:45.210
that the knife in question
belonged to Ms. Vizcaina?

30:45.677 --> 30:49.250
Oh, I'd estimate the
odds are around...

30:49.256 --> 30:52.231
Oh, no, let's not estimate and
let's not use the word "around."

30:53.065 --> 30:55.570
I need you to be very definite
with your answers.

30:55.738 --> 30:58.030
The jury wants to believe you.

30:58.167 --> 31:00.763
Let them know you feel confident
about what you're saying.

31:08.315 --> 31:09.770
Is something the matter?

31:10.066 --> 31:11.960
As a matter of fact, yes.

31:12.905 --> 31:16.783
I suspect that the reason I don't
sound confident in what I'm saying

31:16.948 --> 31:20.233
is because, to be perfectly honest...

31:20.767 --> 31:22.922
I don't believe what I'm saying.

31:28.705 --> 31:30.163
I'm confused.

31:30.385 --> 31:32.461
These are your calculations.

31:32.476 --> 31:34.351
Done to your specifications.

31:34.516 --> 31:36.493
Based on your assumptions.

31:36.557 --> 31:38.553
None of which I agree with.

31:40.028 --> 31:41.263
To be frank,

31:41.428 --> 31:45.680
I think there's a very good chance that
that knife does belong to Imelda Vizcaina.

31:45.776 --> 31:49.230
And I can't help but suspect
that you think so, too.

31:49.237 --> 31:52.601
Dr. DuBois, rest assured,
you have no idea what I'm thinking.

31:52.615 --> 31:55.852
Maybe. Maybe not.

31:56.068 --> 31:58.892
I just... I trust my instincts.

32:00.555 --> 32:02.853
You should try it sometime.

32:05.816 --> 32:07.441
What are you doing here?

32:08.216 --> 32:10.602
Why did you even bother coming back?

32:11.327 --> 32:12.780
Is it the money?

32:12.787 --> 32:14.383
Is it the new suit?

32:21.608 --> 32:24.780
I'm a married woman, Dr. DuBois.

32:29.626 --> 32:31.321
Well, there you go.

32:33.176 --> 32:35.821
All the cool girls are taken.

32:43.486 --> 32:45.870
I'm sorry that I couldn't be of any help.

32:55.128 --> 32:57.972
What do you want me to say, Allison?

32:58.055 --> 33:00.710
I want you to tell me I'm not crazy.

33:01.916 --> 33:07.811
I want you to tell me my feelings,
my impressions, my dreams count for something.

33:08.718 --> 33:11.871
And that I should listen
to them, act on them.

33:14.358 --> 33:15.573
John...

33:17.527 --> 33:18.720
J.D...

33:18.726 --> 33:19.651
Allison...

33:19.655 --> 33:23.391
I have a $40-million client sitting 
a restaurant by himself

33:23.395 --> 33:26.762
drinking within 50 feet 
of three of my competitors.

33:27.115 --> 33:29.572
What do you want to hear,
that I think you're Nostradamus?

33:29.737 --> 33:30.883
Grow up.

33:31.297 --> 33:34.020
Do your job, we'll talk about
it when you get home.

33:36.178 --> 33:37.280
Allison?

33:37.598 --> 33:38.571
Yes?

33:38.577 --> 33:39.873
Are we through?

33:42.165 --> 33:43.803
Yes...

33:45.005 --> 33:46.203
we're through.

33:53.566 --> 33:55.011
I'm going out for awhile.

33:59.015 --> 34:00.822
Are you sure you don't
want to take an umbrella?

34:00.826 --> 34:02.293
They say it's going to rain.

34:09.268 --> 34:10.802
What am I thinking?

34:11.826 --> 34:15.061
Ms. Dunham, you're soaked.
Come on in.

34:15.135 --> 34:17.810
No, answer me.
What am I thinking?

34:19.405 --> 34:21.092
You're right, I know he's guilty.

34:21.094 --> 34:22.541
How do I know that?

34:23.837 --> 34:25.822
I know nothing about math,

34:25.826 --> 34:30.803
but I read your book and suddenly
I understand...everything.

34:31.306 --> 34:33.741
I left your phone number at the office,

34:33.746 --> 34:37.532
but somehow, I knew
exactly how to get here,

34:37.646 --> 34:39.342
to this house...

34:39.935 --> 34:41.530
to you.

34:42.437 --> 34:45.563
And now that I'm here,
everything seems so...

34:46.016 --> 34:48.101
completely familiar.

34:49.956 --> 34:52.989
I-I don't really know
what I'm doing here...

34:55.507 --> 34:57.043
I'm doing what you told me to do.

34:57.045 --> 34:59.280
I am following my instincts.

34:59.676 --> 35:03.162
And my instincts tell me
I am supposed to be here...

35:04.517 --> 35:06.121
with you.

35:25.356 --> 35:28.860
Just forget the last five minutes of your life.

36:52.658 --> 36:53.672
You all right?

36:53.678 --> 36:54.890
What are you doing?

36:56.358 --> 36:59.843
Hi.Oh, my God. It's morning.

37:00.157 --> 37:02.430
I have to get out of here.
I have to go.

37:02.437 --> 37:03.483
Huh?

37:04.906 --> 37:06.052
Why?

37:06.376 --> 37:07.361
What do you mean?

37:07.367 --> 37:09.140
I have to tell my husband.

37:10.078 --> 37:11.421
What?

37:11.548 --> 37:15.772
Mommy...We're hungry.

37:17.276 --> 37:18.782
Oh, my God.

37:18.787 --> 37:23.003
My babies! Come here!
My beautiful babies.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.063
I'm home. Oh, I'm home. I'm home.

37:33.066 --> 37:35.331
Um, excuse me.
Who's gonna drive us?

37:35.337 --> 37:38.671
'Cause I told Hannah I'd meet her early so
we could work on our History presentation.

37:41.068 --> 37:42.932
Wait a second.

37:44.328 --> 37:45.540
Allison.

37:47.485 --> 37:49.291
I was beginning to think
you forgot about me.

37:50.097 --> 37:52.870
Wasn't there something you wanted to speak
to me about before I headed into court?

37:52.878 --> 37:54.310
One of the jurors or something?

37:54.317 --> 37:57.592
Actually, sir, there's a lot I need to tell
you before you head into court.

37:57.617 --> 38:01.063
Did anyone check ?
Did anyone look for her?

38:01.146 --> 38:06.311
Did anyone try to find out where
Miss Vizcaina might have gone?

38:07.088 --> 38:11.062
For all we know, she decided to leave
this country and go back home

38:11.067 --> 38:16.822
to the remote mountain town that the
District Attorney so poetically described.

38:16.826 --> 38:19.720
It wouldn't be easy to
track her down there,

38:19.728 --> 38:24.342
but if someone tried, who knows
what they might discover?

38:25.235 --> 38:28.752
I should know, because
that's exactly what I did.

38:29.255 --> 38:30.811
I tried.

38:31.546 --> 38:34.692
And you'll never guess
what I found.

38:48.656 --> 38:51.173
Like I said, ladies and
gentlemen of the jury,

38:51.685 --> 38:54.430
you'll never guess
what I found.

39:05.018 --> 39:06.531
There a problem,
Mr. Watts?

39:06.538 --> 39:10.362
Are you going to continue or
have you concluded your remarks?

39:11.267 --> 39:16.173
Uh, if I may Your Honor, I'd like
to request a short recess.

39:16.186 --> 39:17.393
Very well.

39:17.628 --> 39:20.592
This court will adjourn
for a half hour recess.

39:21.827 --> 39:23.942
- What the hell happened?
- I'm not sure yet.

39:23.955 --> 39:24.963
Excuse me, Larry.

39:25.896 --> 39:27.040
We should talk.

39:36.006 --> 39:39.130
Amazing what people will do for
money if they're desperate enough.

39:40.045 --> 39:43.703
But then, that's what this whole
case has been about, hasn't it?

39:44.747 --> 39:48.320
They both look remarkably
like Imelda Vizcaina to me.

39:50.437 --> 39:52.881
Actually, this one is Imelda.

39:52.887 --> 39:54.723
The other girl is Mirabella.

39:54.727 --> 39:56.341
Her twin sister.

39:56.347 --> 39:58.781
Unlike Imelda, Mirabella never
came to America.

39:58.786 --> 40:00.950
She stayed behind in El Salvador.

40:01.518 --> 40:02.912
Spent her entire life there.

40:02.916 --> 40:05.212
It's where this movie
was made, actually.

40:05.958 --> 40:09.973
Well, you certainly know your Central American
porn, Manuel. I got to give you that.

40:10.158 --> 40:13.460
Apparently Mirabella was held up
at Phoenix Airport this morning

40:13.467 --> 40:17.352
trying to use her sister's
papers to enter this country.

40:18.095 --> 40:20.751
She's being detained until
we can determine

40:20.768 --> 40:24.362
whether she had any ulterior motives
for traveling to Arizona today.

40:24.546 --> 40:26.113
Ulterior motives?

40:26.215 --> 40:28.892
Her sister Imelda was
in this country illegally.

40:28.897 --> 40:31.323
No government agency
had her fingerprints,

40:31.325 --> 40:33.483
and none were ever recovered
from the apartment.

40:33.485 --> 40:36.933
If, somehow, Mirabella had managed
to make it to the trial today,

40:36.937 --> 40:43.132
and if for some bizarre reason she had chosen
to identify herself as her sister to the court,

40:43.148 --> 40:46.252
there would have been no way for the
prosecution to prove otherwise.

40:46.258 --> 40:47.593
For all intents and purposes,

40:47.595 --> 40:50.623
it would have appeared that Imelda
Vizcaina was alive and well,

40:50.628 --> 40:53.631
and we would have had to drop
all charges against your client.

40:53.725 --> 40:56.401
And you can imagine how embarrassing 
that would've been for me.

41:07.046 --> 41:08.132
Grandma...

41:09.688 --> 41:10.763
Allison?

41:10.768 --> 41:13.230
What are you doing back here?
Didn't you just leave?

41:13.235 --> 41:15.552
Grandma. I changed my mind.

41:15.558 --> 41:17.762
Go back to sleep. 
Don't worry about the pie.

41:17.766 --> 41:19.311
I'll be here in a minute with J.D.

41:19.317 --> 41:20.332
I'll get it.

41:20.345 --> 41:23.351
What about the burn?
Your arm? That scar?

41:23.548 --> 41:25.150
I don't care about the scar.

41:25.158 --> 41:26.492
It'll fade with time.

41:27.416 --> 41:29.800
I think I actually kind of like the scar.

41:30.087 --> 41:32.141
I think I'd miss it if it was gone.

41:32.598 --> 41:34.142
It's part of my life.

41:34.458 --> 41:36.183
And I love my life.

41:36.738 --> 41:38.231
And the fact is,

41:38.377 --> 41:40.433
I wouldn't change a thing.

41:41.695 --> 41:44.001
Well, all right. If you're sure.

41:44.075 --> 41:45.773
I'm sure.
