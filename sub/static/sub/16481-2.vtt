WEBVTT

00:08.708 --> 00:12.317
So... a large plant murdered Ms. Hobart,

00:12.342 --> 00:16.878
and then attempted to murder
you before you passed out.

00:16.947 --> 00:19.814
You were then awakened moments
later by Mr. Jackson here,

00:19.850 --> 00:22.651
who probably frightened
the monster away.

00:25.522 --> 00:29.457
And now Ms. Hobart's body is missing.

00:29.526 --> 00:32.794
Is that what you'd have us believe?

00:32.829 --> 00:36.231
Or it was someone dressed
up as a large plant.

00:38.268 --> 00:41.403
Suspect can't stick to a story.

00:41.471 --> 00:43.138
What... suspect?

00:43.206 --> 00:45.974
How did I become a suspect?

00:46.043 --> 00:49.411
I was... I was locked in the bathtub.

00:49.479 --> 00:53.281
How could I have smeared
a 200-foot trail

00:53.350 --> 00:55.116
of swamp slime across the hallway,

00:55.185 --> 00:57.585
then decapitate a werewolf?

00:57.654 --> 00:59.654
I mean, why would I do that? Why?

00:59.723 --> 01:01.556
Mm.

01:01.625 --> 01:04.391
Suspect unclear of her own motives.

01:05.696 --> 01:07.095
I'm just curious,

01:07.164 --> 01:09.164
do you have to have
graduated high school

01:09.232 --> 01:11.299
- to become a detective?
- No, ma'am.

01:11.368 --> 01:13.268
I know what I saw, okay?!

01:13.336 --> 01:15.970
There is a killer on the loose!

01:16.006 --> 01:17.405
Chamberlain?

01:17.474 --> 01:19.774
Chamberlain, tell them.

01:19.843 --> 01:21.509
Well, I did hear them screaming,

01:21.578 --> 01:23.111
but by the time I got down here,

01:23.180 --> 01:25.013
it was only Chanel #5 in the room.

01:25.082 --> 01:27.315
That is, until Dr. Munsch walked in.

01:27.384 --> 01:30.118
Well, the Wi-Fi is down in my apartment.

01:30.187 --> 01:32.854
I was on a Skype call in my office.

01:32.923 --> 01:34.089
Dean Munsch.

01:34.157 --> 01:36.691
Number Five is obviously crazy.

01:36.760 --> 01:38.793
She probably murdered Catherine
herself for the attention,

01:38.829 --> 01:41.396
because she hasn't been
touched in months.

01:41.431 --> 01:42.931
I don't even think
she's touched herself.

01:42.999 --> 01:44.666
Even her hand thinks she's gross.

01:44.735 --> 01:47.001
The closest she's gotten to sex
is when a bookshelf fell on her.

01:47.037 --> 01:49.037
Yeah. Number Five is just jealous

01:49.106 --> 01:51.172
because Number Three and I got asked out

01:51.241 --> 01:53.708
by Dr. Brock and Dr.
Cascade, and she didn't.

01:53.777 --> 01:55.176
So while we were on our way

01:55.212 --> 01:57.011
to our hot double date in Bonetown,

01:57.047 --> 01:59.114
she decided to sabotage it,

01:59.182 --> 02:01.983
by killing a poor, defenseless,
hairless creature.

02:02.052 --> 02:04.385
Hiding the body and forcing
us to hurry back to listen to

02:04.454 --> 02:06.121
the least-terrifying story
anyone has ever heard.

02:06.189 --> 02:07.822
All right.

02:07.891 --> 02:09.890
I don't think we're ever gonna
really know what happened here.

02:09.960 --> 02:11.693
What?!

02:11.762 --> 02:14.629
Sorry, sweetheart. The
evidence is just inconclusive.

02:14.698 --> 02:16.564
Call me if anything else comes up.

02:16.633 --> 02:21.136
In the meantime, no more made-up
stories that aren't that scary.

02:21.204 --> 02:25.006
I'm telling the truth. I swear.

02:25.041 --> 02:27.842
â™ª

02:30.647 --> 02:32.013
<i>Tyler, can you tell us</i>

02:32.082 --> 02:33.748
<i>when the growths first appeared?</i>

02:33.784 --> 02:35.784
- About two years ago.
- Hold on.

02:38.889 --> 02:40.989
Have you ever tried popping those?

02:41.057 --> 02:43.224
Uh-uh. Nope. We've already
talked about this.

02:43.293 --> 02:45.760
I'm not gonna sit here while you
try to demean another patient.

02:45.829 --> 02:47.929
I am not demeaning anyone.

02:47.998 --> 02:50.031
I am being brash and confident,

02:50.100 --> 02:51.866
because I am the out-of-the-box thinker

02:51.935 --> 02:53.768
who brilliantly solved our last case

02:53.837 --> 02:56.204
without resorting to a
full-frontal lobotomy.

02:56.273 --> 02:57.772
- Well...
- If I was gonna be mean,

02:57.841 --> 02:59.707
I'd ask him if he kissed a toad.

02:59.776 --> 03:01.409
Or if he <i> was</i> a toad.

03:01.478 --> 03:04.212
He at least had some lineage,
like a toad grandparent.

03:04.281 --> 03:06.414
Or if he rented out his pores
on Airbnb for hundreds

03:06.449 --> 03:08.416
of expectant female spiders
to lay their eggs in.

03:08.485 --> 03:09.584
Okay, we get it.

03:09.653 --> 03:11.853
You're not being mean.

03:11.922 --> 03:15.790
Yes, um, I have tried it, but it hurts,

03:15.859 --> 03:18.860
and it doesn't work
because they're not zits.

03:18.929 --> 03:22.163
I was diagnosed with
neurofibromatosis type 1,

03:22.199 --> 03:24.365
which my doctor said it was genetic.

03:24.434 --> 03:27.268
Well, Tyler, there's
good news and bad news.

03:27.304 --> 03:31.206
Good news is that there's a
machine called a CO2 laser

03:31.274 --> 03:33.041
that can shrink and eventually
remove your tumors.

03:33.109 --> 03:34.943
It's completely painless.

03:35.011 --> 03:37.378
- Really? That's-that's great.
- Mm-hmm.

03:37.447 --> 03:39.047
Well, you didn't wait for the bad news.

03:39.115 --> 03:40.648
Yeah, the bad news is
they're-they're cumbersome

03:40.717 --> 03:43.051
and they're super expensive
and we don't have one.

03:43.119 --> 03:44.586
I don't have any money.
The only money I make

03:44.654 --> 03:46.554
is writing Encyclopedia
Brown fan fiction.

03:46.590 --> 03:48.089
I used to love Encyclopedia Brown.

03:48.158 --> 03:49.791
Yeah, you would.

03:49.860 --> 03:51.259
Look at me.

03:51.328 --> 03:53.561
Look at me. I'm a monster.

03:53.630 --> 03:55.263
I don't have anywhere else to go.

03:55.332 --> 03:56.831
My life is a complete mess.

03:56.900 --> 03:58.900
I'm desperate.

03:58.969 --> 04:03.471
So can you please, please, just help me?

04:08.178 --> 04:10.144
Oh! Zayday.

04:12.883 --> 04:14.682
You don't happen to
know if there are any

04:14.751 --> 04:16.951
New Guinean restaurants in town, do you?

04:17.019 --> 04:18.418
No.

04:18.488 --> 04:20.021
I didn't even know that was a thing.

04:20.055 --> 04:21.822
Yeah. I just have a taste for it.

04:21.892 --> 04:23.124
As you were.

04:28.865 --> 04:30.531
Chamberlain, right?

04:30.600 --> 04:32.400
Could I talk to you for a minute?

04:32.469 --> 04:34.936
Okay, so you changed your mind;
you want to go out with me.

04:34.971 --> 04:36.571
What? No.

04:37.707 --> 04:39.007
It's Munsch.

04:39.075 --> 04:40.441
There's something bugging me about her,

04:40.477 --> 04:42.310
and there's nobody else
I can talk to about it.

04:42.379 --> 04:43.845
I'm suspicious.

04:43.880 --> 04:46.381
I mean, why would she want to run
a hospital in the first place?

04:46.449 --> 04:48.016
I don't know, to help people?

04:48.084 --> 04:50.385
Yeah, but she also was the
dean of a university.

04:50.453 --> 04:53.821
Why would she start a hospital
to cure only a handful of people

04:53.890 --> 04:55.456
with really obscure diseases?

04:55.525 --> 04:58.326
I mean, she had to pour every
penny she had into this place.

04:58.395 --> 05:00.028
Who does that?

05:00.096 --> 05:02.063
She is rich.

05:02.132 --> 05:03.865
And why would she hire
me and the Chanels?

05:03.934 --> 05:05.600
The Chanels are idiots,
and she hates them.

05:05.635 --> 05:07.635
Like really <i> hates</i> them, hates them.

05:07.704 --> 05:10.338
I believe you got a theory. I do.

05:10.407 --> 05:11.839
There's something about the story

05:11.875 --> 05:13.808
that Number Five was
telling the other day.

05:13.877 --> 05:16.644
I mean, she said the swamp
monster that killed Catherine

05:16.713 --> 05:19.213
was about to kill her, and
then you scared it off.

05:19.282 --> 05:20.815
And Dean Munsch was just upstairs

05:20.884 --> 05:22.917
in her office the whole time?

05:22.986 --> 05:24.352
After hours?

05:24.421 --> 05:25.853
You said it yourself.

05:25.922 --> 05:27.689
Dean Munsch said good night to both you

05:27.757 --> 05:30.692
and Chanel Number Five long
before Catherine was murdered.

05:30.760 --> 05:33.561
- So what, you think she's in on it?
- She has to be.

05:33.630 --> 05:35.897
It's the only thing that makes
any of this make sense.

05:35.966 --> 05:37.532
I think she's out for revenge.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.535
I think she gathered all the
Chanels here in one place,

05:40.603 --> 05:43.972
so she could knock them off one by one.

05:44.040 --> 05:45.740
It's like <i> Ten Little Indians.</i>

05:45.809 --> 05:47.909
- Whoa, what? You can't say that.
<i>-Ten Little Indians.</i>

05:47.978 --> 05:49.277
Agatha Christie novel.

05:49.346 --> 05:50.912
- That still doesn't make it okay.
- Look, okay.

05:50.981 --> 05:52.280
That's not the point; the point is,

05:52.349 --> 05:55.183
we have to get to the bottom of this...
together.

05:55.251 --> 05:57.885
And figure out exactly
what Dean Munsch is after.

05:57.954 --> 05:59.921
Okay.

05:59.990 --> 06:01.622
I'm in.

06:01.658 --> 06:02.590
It's not a date.

06:03.660 --> 06:05.526
It's not a date.

06:05.595 --> 06:09.364
<i>I'm so happy we rescheduled</i>
our May-December date.

06:10.633 --> 06:13.201
How are you gonna eat all that popcorn?

06:13.269 --> 06:14.402
I'm not gonna eat any of it.

06:14.471 --> 06:16.137
You see, I buy the biggest tub

06:16.206 --> 06:17.805
of popcorn they sell and have
them cover it in butter,

06:17.874 --> 06:19.407
and then I secretly drop handfuls of it

06:19.442 --> 06:21.075
on the floor as the movie plays.

06:21.144 --> 06:23.044
I don't understand. Why?

06:23.079 --> 06:25.646
To make the fatties feel
bad about themselves.

06:25.715 --> 06:27.482
Then they feel terrible and eat more.

06:27.550 --> 06:29.117
It's, like, my favorite hobby.

06:29.185 --> 06:31.419
You are the most incredible
woman I've ever met.

06:31.488 --> 06:33.287
Thank you.

06:33.356 --> 06:35.390
I'm having a really nice time.

06:37.000 --> 06:43.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:49.305 --> 06:51.773
Sorry. I'm sorry.

06:51.841 --> 06:52.974
Are you kidding?

06:53.043 --> 06:56.110
I haven't been manhandled
in, like, two years.

06:56.179 --> 06:58.112
Grope at will, Doctor.

07:10.360 --> 07:11.692
Hey!

07:11.761 --> 07:13.428
- Sorry, sorry, sir.
- You could have just asked.

07:13.496 --> 07:16.164
I know. Here. Sorry.

07:16.232 --> 07:17.765
Oh, my God... wait.

07:17.834 --> 07:20.701
Are you imitating the guy in the
movie with the out-of-control hand?

07:21.838 --> 07:23.771
- Yeah.
- That is amazing.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.507
You know, I never thought
I could put my heart

07:26.576 --> 07:28.709
back together again after
losing Chad Radwell,

07:28.778 --> 07:30.545
but after being with
you tonight and your,

07:30.580 --> 07:32.713
your amazing hand and your hot mouth,

07:32.782 --> 07:34.849
I know I'm finally ready to move on.

07:43.593 --> 07:45.159
Hey. Why are you so sad?

07:47.030 --> 07:50.798
My first boyfriend's name was Clarence.

07:50.867 --> 07:53.434
He had hair like Richard
Grieco and he played lacrosse,

07:53.503 --> 07:56.704
but... he was also imaginary.

07:56.739 --> 07:59.407
We dated all throughout high school.

07:59.476 --> 08:01.976
And the day before graduation,
he broke up with me.

08:02.045 --> 08:05.246
I thought things would
be different in college.

08:05.315 --> 08:08.149
I mean, especially when I joined
Kappa and became a Chanel,

08:08.218 --> 08:10.818
but then Chanel told everybody
that I had teeth in my vagina,

08:10.887 --> 08:12.854
so it's basically impossible
for me to get a date.

08:12.922 --> 08:15.256
But I knew this would be different.

08:15.325 --> 08:17.391
We're supposed to be grownups now.

08:17.460 --> 08:19.494
But it's exactly the same.

08:19.562 --> 08:21.362
I mean, it's only two
weeks, and already Chanel

08:21.397 --> 08:22.830
and Number Three have
hot doctor boyfriends

08:22.899 --> 08:24.532
and no one will even look at me.

08:24.601 --> 08:27.602
I look like I'm wrapped
in infected bubble wrap.

08:28.905 --> 08:30.338
- Mm.
- Yeah.

08:30.406 --> 08:34.107
Shouldn't be complaining to you.
Your life is so much worse.

08:34.144 --> 08:35.676
No, I don't mind.

08:35.745 --> 08:39.179
I can't even tell you how long it's
been since a girl even talked to me.

08:39.249 --> 08:41.414
Do you want to see what I
used to look before all this?

08:42.784 --> 08:44.719
You were hot!

08:44.787 --> 08:46.754
Like, super hot.

08:46.823 --> 08:50.158
I just don't know how I'm gonna
find the money for this laser.

08:58.468 --> 09:00.601
I'm gonna find the money for that laser.

09:00.637 --> 09:03.237
I don't know how, but I'm gonna find it.

10:13.576 --> 10:15.443
Chad?

10:15.478 --> 10:16.711
What the hell?!

10:16.779 --> 10:18.112
Oh, the look on your face.

10:18.181 --> 10:21.148
God, I knew I should have strapped
a GoPro to my Red Devil mask.

10:24.220 --> 10:26.087
What are you doing with your hand?

10:27.290 --> 10:29.190
It wasn't funny when you snuck into

10:29.225 --> 10:30.691
the insane asylum in the
middle of the night

10:30.760 --> 10:32.893
and scared me in my bed,
and it's not funny now.

10:32.929 --> 10:34.095
I thought it was pretty funny.

10:34.163 --> 10:35.296
Maybe not <i>Happy Gilmore</i> funny.

10:35.365 --> 10:36.564
Definitely <i>Big Daddy</i> funny.

10:36.633 --> 10:37.965
What is that screaming?

10:38.034 --> 10:42.737
That's my good buddy Randall.
He needs medical attention.

10:42.805 --> 10:44.839
Think he's gonna die.

10:48.117 --> 10:49.824
I want you back.

10:57.492 --> 10:58.991
So we're on our annual hunting trip

10:59.060 --> 11:00.893
with the International
Order of Saint Guntington.

11:00.962 --> 11:02.428
It's an elite secret society of hunters

11:02.497 --> 11:05.071
that dates back to the
Hapsburger Dynasty.

11:05.533 --> 11:08.834
Okay, did anything
odd happen on the trip?

11:08.903 --> 11:11.938
Was he bit by a tick or hit in the head?

11:12.006 --> 11:13.906
That is an excellent question, C.

11:15.376 --> 11:17.643
Are you guys boning?

11:17.712 --> 11:20.746
Went to the movies last
night, I grabbed her boob.

11:20.815 --> 11:22.815
- One boob? I thought doctors had game.
- Mm-hmm.

11:22.884 --> 11:24.450
- Why don't you try two handfuls...
- Okay, okay.

11:24.519 --> 11:26.319
You can fight over
Chanel's breasts later.

11:26.387 --> 11:29.956
Though it would be sort of like
going to war over the Falklands.

11:30.024 --> 11:33.526
Lot of work for a relatively small
and insignificant amount of land.

11:34.729 --> 11:36.095
Anyway, please continue.

11:36.164 --> 11:37.430
Thank you.

11:37.498 --> 11:39.265
So we're on our annual quail swim

11:39.334 --> 11:43.302
with the <i> Ordensbrothers</i> RBG,
Bill Parcells, Ted Danson.

11:43.371 --> 11:45.137
Giant covey of quail take off

11:45.206 --> 11:47.540
right in front of us, we lower
our guns to take 'em out.

11:47.575 --> 11:49.642
Ginsberg... she bagged
two, two or three.

11:49.677 --> 11:51.344
Hell of a shot. All of a sudden,

11:51.379 --> 11:53.312
a couple stragglers take
off after the first

11:53.381 --> 11:56.148
volley of shots, Randal lowers
his gun to take 'em out,

11:56.217 --> 11:57.850
when all of a sudden,
Liz Cheney pops out.

11:57.919 --> 11:59.618
- And I think she was, like, peeing.
- Mm-hmm.

11:59.687 --> 12:01.620
Anyway, Randal lowers his shotgun,

12:01.689 --> 12:03.556
shoots her right in the face. Boom!

12:03.624 --> 12:05.658
Hope she was okay.

12:05.727 --> 12:07.560
No, I don't. She's awful.

12:07.628 --> 12:09.495
Your friend has the Jumping Frenchman

12:09.564 --> 12:12.465
of Maine disease. Watch this.

12:13.141 --> 12:14.867
We don't have a full
understanding of what causes it,

12:14.902 --> 12:17.236
physiologically, but
we do know sufferers

12:17.305 --> 12:19.739
of this disorder have an
exaggerated startle reflex.

12:19.774 --> 12:21.140
- Mah!
- Like that.

12:21.209 --> 12:22.708
You know, any slight little stimuli

12:22.777 --> 12:24.543
- sort of sets him off.
- Mah!

12:24.612 --> 12:26.812
Okay.

12:26.881 --> 12:28.681
Okay. My guess is that shooting

12:28.716 --> 12:31.250
Liz Cheney in the face
probably set this off.

12:31.285 --> 12:34.553
Wow. Dr. Holt, you are... incredible.

12:34.622 --> 12:36.322
Yeah?

12:36.357 --> 12:38.057
Did I tell you I started a band?

12:38.126 --> 12:39.525
I'm the lead singer.

12:39.594 --> 12:42.395
Front man. It's called
Gold-Plated Nutsack.

12:43.898 --> 12:46.866
Please, please, somebody help me.

12:46.934 --> 12:49.068
I feel like I'm gonna
die from screaming.

12:49.137 --> 12:51.737
I'm sorry, Randal, but there...
there's no known cure.

12:51.806 --> 12:55.508
But that is the point
of this hospital...

12:55.576 --> 12:58.844
to cure the heretofore incurable.

12:58.880 --> 13:02.114
So, don't worry, Randal. We
are going to help you out.

13:02.183 --> 13:04.617
You have my word.

13:04.685 --> 13:06.085
Sorry.

13:06.154 --> 13:08.154
Nutsack.

13:11.726 --> 13:13.893
How do you feel about revenge sex?

13:13.961 --> 13:15.928
<i>- Hello, America.</i>

13:15.997 --> 13:17.730
<i>My name is Chanel #5.</i>

13:17.799 --> 13:21.200
<i>And I'm here to ask you for help.</i>

13:21.269 --> 13:23.736
This is my friend Tyler.

13:23.805 --> 13:28.140
He used to be hot, and now he's
covered in weird skin bubbles.

13:28.176 --> 13:32.111
Hi. I'm Tyler, and two years
ago, I was diagnosed with...

13:32.180 --> 13:35.548
Two years ago, he was diagnosed
with neurofibromatosis type 1.

13:35.616 --> 13:38.551
It's a crippling disease
that turned this hot guy

13:38.586 --> 13:42.555
into a living, breathing monster.

13:42.623 --> 13:44.457
Won't you please help him

13:44.525 --> 13:46.492
afford the expensive laser

13:46.561 --> 13:48.661
- that could end his torment?
- Okay, I can't watch this anymore.

13:48.696 --> 13:52.965
Number Five, that is the worst
fund-raising video ever made.

13:53.034 --> 13:55.101
What are you talking about?
It's really emotional.

13:55.169 --> 13:57.670
- It's really not.
- Okay, Number Five,

13:57.738 --> 14:00.439
you're going about this all wrong.

14:00.508 --> 14:03.109
But you want Tyler to get
those laser treatments

14:03.177 --> 14:06.145
so he'll be hot again and
you can date him, right?

14:06.214 --> 14:09.515
Well, Number Five, once he's hot again,

14:09.584 --> 14:11.083
he's not gonna want to date you.

14:11.152 --> 14:12.651
Chanel's right. The only shot

14:12.720 --> 14:14.553
you have with Tyler is
if he stays all warty.

14:14.622 --> 14:16.755
Look, if you want to be with
Tyler, you need to go for him

14:16.824 --> 14:20.426
now, be the girl that stood by
him through his tumoriest days.

14:20.495 --> 14:22.261
Then when he's hot again,
he'll feel obligated

14:22.330 --> 14:24.029
to stay with you and never leave.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.803
All right, what we got?

14:30.838 --> 14:32.671
Someone must have hired someone

14:32.740 --> 14:35.274
from one of those online
reputation redemption companies

14:35.343 --> 14:37.376
to scrub clean any
file on this hospital.

14:37.445 --> 14:39.545
And all that comes up on Google is stuff

14:39.614 --> 14:41.147
from when it first opened

14:41.182 --> 14:43.282
and an article about Dean
Munsch buying the place.

14:43.351 --> 14:46.118
And a whole chunk from when
it was just a normal hospital

14:46.187 --> 14:47.786
in the 1980s is missing.

14:47.855 --> 14:50.589
Look, what we need to do is
go down to the local library

14:50.658 --> 14:52.124
and just search the microfiche files.

14:52.160 --> 14:53.392
You can't scrub those.

14:53.461 --> 14:54.894
Oh, great idea. Let's go.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.896
No, Zayday doesn't go to the library.

14:56.964 --> 14:59.465
Chamberlain brings the
library to Zayday.

14:59.534 --> 15:01.133
I went this afternoon.

15:01.202 --> 15:04.036
Libraries are very "screepy" places.

15:04.105 --> 15:07.039
Okay, but don't we
need a special machine

15:07.108 --> 15:09.108
to be able to look at these things?

15:09.143 --> 15:11.677
All set up downstairs
in the archives room.

15:16.250 --> 15:19.218
I feel like I'm in one of
those movies from the 1970s.

15:25.660 --> 15:28.761
This is from November 1, 1986.

15:28.829 --> 15:33.265
The entire hospital staff was
murdered on Halloween night.

15:39.574 --> 15:41.574
Hey, what are you guys dressed as?

15:41.642 --> 15:44.577
I am NASA's <i>Voyager 2</i> spacecraft.

15:44.645 --> 15:46.345
And I'm Uranus.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.746
Ooh!

15:47.815 --> 15:51.016
On January 24, NASA's <i> Voyager 2</i>

15:51.085 --> 15:54.186
made its first encounter with Uranus.

15:54.222 --> 15:56.956
And tonight Dr. Mike and I are gonna

15:57.024 --> 15:59.191
recreate the encounter here on Earth.

15:59.260 --> 16:01.126
Amazing!

16:01.162 --> 16:03.963
Hey, do you guys want to go
do some cocaine with us?

16:04.031 --> 16:06.365
Not while "Mad About You" is playing.

16:08.102 --> 16:09.902
Maybe I shouldn't be doing this.

16:09.971 --> 16:12.738
I am still on call.

16:26.988 --> 16:28.354
Leave me alone!

16:36.530 --> 16:39.098
That mask looks familiar.

16:39.166 --> 16:41.400
No. It can't be.

16:41.469 --> 16:44.169
No. No one knows. I didn't tell anybody.

16:44.238 --> 16:46.905
- I didn't tell anybody.
- Hey!

16:46.974 --> 16:49.842
Hey! What do you want?!

16:49.877 --> 16:51.243
Who are you?!

17:15.403 --> 17:17.935
Oh, my God!

17:50.037 --> 17:53.505
No one was arrested. They
never found out who did it.

17:57.745 --> 17:59.912
What have you two been doing?

17:59.947 --> 18:01.914
Nothing?

18:03.250 --> 18:04.450
Are you feeling okay?

18:04.485 --> 18:07.619
I'm gonna be feeling great
in about 15 minutes.

18:09.657 --> 18:11.824
You live with the Chanels, right?

18:11.892 --> 18:13.525
That's right.

18:13.594 --> 18:17.696
Would you mind providing detailed
information as to their schedules?

18:17.765 --> 18:20.599
Like where they are at
certain times of the day,

18:20.668 --> 18:23.001
when they're most likely to be alone.

18:23.037 --> 18:24.837
Why would you need to know that?

18:24.872 --> 18:26.839
If I know where the Chanels
are at any given time,

18:26.907 --> 18:29.074
I can make sure they can handle
the workload they've been given,

18:29.143 --> 18:30.509
considering they're idiots
who aren't doctors.

18:30.578 --> 18:32.111
Well, in that case, you'd need to want

18:32.146 --> 18:34.847
to know the same information
about me, wouldn't you?

18:34.882 --> 18:37.282
Uh... yeah. Right.

18:37.351 --> 18:38.884
Uh-uh.

18:38.953 --> 18:40.552
Way you just said...
that made it seem like

18:40.621 --> 18:42.554
you only want intels on the Chanels.

18:42.590 --> 18:45.724
Well, what if I did?

18:45.793 --> 18:47.693
That would mean your
explanation was a lie,

18:47.762 --> 18:49.795
and I'd have a real
problem with helping you.

18:49.864 --> 18:53.932
Fine. If you can't help me,
I'll find someone who can.

18:57.338 --> 18:58.937
Pick up my supplements.

19:07.332 --> 19:09.365
Morning.

19:13.803 --> 19:16.170
What are you doing?

19:16.269 --> 19:18.603
Uh, showering?

19:18.672 --> 19:19.808
My third of the day.

19:19.839 --> 19:22.540
Like to stay extra fresh just
in case emergency sex pops up.

19:22.608 --> 19:24.308
This is an employee locker room.

19:25.611 --> 19:27.444
Ah. Look, I get it.

19:27.513 --> 19:28.946
Standing in here

19:29.015 --> 19:33.551
with me... all naked, sudsed up.

19:33.619 --> 19:35.252
You're thinking to yourself,

19:35.321 --> 19:38.722
"Wow! That is the last climber
to summit Mount Chanel.

19:38.758 --> 19:41.759
How am I supposed to compete with that?"

19:41.827 --> 19:45.963
Look, Chad, I'm a surgeon...
a brilliant one.

19:46.032 --> 19:49.466
You check off two boxes on
the dateable guy checklist:

19:49.535 --> 19:50.734
handsome and rich.

19:50.803 --> 19:53.470
And guess what, I check those, too.

19:53.539 --> 19:56.307
Okay, first of all, I have
never heard of that checklist,

19:56.375 --> 19:57.975
so I call bull crap on that existing.

19:58.044 --> 20:00.077
Oh, it exists.

20:00.146 --> 20:02.079
Second, did you just call me handsome?

20:02.148 --> 20:04.648
'Cause, given the circumstances,
that's a little weird.

20:04.717 --> 20:07.017
Third...

20:07.053 --> 20:09.453
I'm glad you brought up boxes.

20:09.522 --> 20:13.490
Isn't that what this is all about...
Chanel's box?

20:13.559 --> 20:15.659
Well, guess what, Dr. I Got Lucky

20:15.728 --> 20:18.362
Guessing What's Wrong With
Chad's Good Buddy Randal.

20:18.431 --> 20:20.698
The only dude in the shower

20:20.733 --> 20:24.435
that's ever gonna check
Chanel's box is me.

20:24.503 --> 20:27.538
I don't know if I could
stand for that, Chad.

20:27.607 --> 20:30.174
Well, before this gets
any more homoerotic...

20:30.209 --> 20:31.976
I don't think that's possible.

20:32.044 --> 20:34.645
...I'm gonna do something I
hoped I wouldn't have to do.

20:34.714 --> 20:37.915
We're gonna settle this in the
ancient Radwell tradition.

20:37.950 --> 20:41.685
You and me, local YMCA, squash.

20:41.721 --> 20:43.120
First to 11.

20:43.189 --> 20:45.456
Best out of three, winner gets Chanel.

20:45.524 --> 20:48.125
That is awful and
misogynistic to use a girl

20:48.160 --> 20:51.395
as a prize for a sporting event.

20:51.464 --> 20:54.698
But Chanel's worth it.

20:54.767 --> 20:56.467
I'm in.

21:00.039 --> 21:02.039
Think our wieners just
touched accidentally.

21:02.108 --> 21:04.341
I know they think I'm crazy
because I tend to respond

21:04.410 --> 21:08.045
to everything with the same extreme
level of intensity, but it was real.

21:08.114 --> 21:12.216
I was attacked. And I
didn't kill Werewolf Girl.

21:12.285 --> 21:15.085
You know, I'm actually kind
of an amateur detective,

21:15.154 --> 21:16.754
'cause all the Encyclopedia
Brown fan fiction I write.

21:16.822 --> 21:18.522
What if I helped you find proof?

21:18.591 --> 21:21.925
And you will not even have to
leave one quarter on the gas can.

21:25.331 --> 21:26.897
Mm. I don't understand.

21:26.966 --> 21:28.932
It's an Encyclopedia Brown joke.

21:29.001 --> 21:30.501
- Yeah.
- Mm.

21:30.569 --> 21:33.237
I basically have zero personality.

21:33.306 --> 21:36.206
I like your personality.

21:36.275 --> 21:37.841
You like his personality?

21:38.838 --> 21:42.640
And here we thought you were
just into guys who look like...

21:42.710 --> 21:45.045
the inside of a
hemorrhoid-infested butt.

21:46.380 --> 21:47.980
Dude, he looks like bubble wrap

21:48.048 --> 21:49.615
with a... with a staph infection.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.116
No, wait. I have a better one.

21:51.185 --> 21:52.417
He looks like one of those...

21:55.656 --> 21:58.957
You cannot speak to him this way!

21:59.026 --> 22:04.329
He is a beautiful soul, and I
do not have teeth in my vagina!

22:08.569 --> 22:11.303
I'm... sorry.

22:11.372 --> 22:15.574
Sometimes I tend to overreact a little
bit since I stopped taking my meds.

22:19.813 --> 22:23.548
- Can I help you?
- Actually, you can.

22:23.584 --> 22:26.151
Why did you have the online history
of this hospital scrubbed?

22:26.220 --> 22:27.819
What's this all about?

22:27.888 --> 22:30.489
On October 31, 1986,

22:30.557 --> 22:32.324
there was a mass murder
in this hospital,

22:32.393 --> 22:35.560
and all the evidence that was
left behind was green slime.

22:35.629 --> 22:38.597
That same green slime was there the
night that Chanel #5 was attacked,

22:38.666 --> 22:39.965
and you just happened to be there.

22:41.235 --> 22:42.567
So what is your theory?

22:42.636 --> 22:44.870
<i>You</i> attacked Chanel #5.

22:44.938 --> 22:46.405
Or you had someone do it.

22:46.473 --> 22:49.274
Me, Chanel, Number Three, Number Five...
we're your loose ends.

22:49.343 --> 22:53.045
You gathered us all here in one place
so you could knock us off one by one.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.313
Shh!

23:00.954 --> 23:03.855
I could really use a friend right now.

23:03.924 --> 23:05.857
Just someone to talk to.

23:05.893 --> 23:08.160
Just sit and listen.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.300
Well...

23:15.369 --> 23:19.304
what I'm gonna tell you is in
the strictest of confidence.

23:19.373 --> 23:21.173
Is that understood?

23:25.312 --> 23:28.080
I'm not trying to murder anyone.

23:28.115 --> 23:30.148
I'm trying to save someone's life.

23:32.319 --> 23:33.819
Mine.

23:35.689 --> 23:38.323
The headaches started
about eight months ago.

23:38.392 --> 23:40.759
Just blistering headaches.

23:40.828 --> 23:44.763
At first, I thought it was the stress
and excitement of my book tour.

23:44.832 --> 23:47.466
Then the searing joint pain

23:47.534 --> 23:49.935
and the shivering... I-I
would freeze all night

23:50.003 --> 23:52.003
and wake up in a pool of sweat.

23:55.075 --> 23:56.274
And then

23:56.343 --> 23:59.845
my neighbor...

23:59.913 --> 24:02.581
asked me why I was walking so weird.

24:02.649 --> 24:06.118
It was subtle at first, but
then I noticed it, too.

24:06.153 --> 24:08.987
My gait has changed.

24:09.056 --> 24:14.526
I-I've been to doctors and specialists.

24:14.595 --> 24:16.828
They just...

24:16.897 --> 24:19.498
they just don't know what it is.

24:19.533 --> 24:21.767
In fact, they don't think it's anything.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.503
But-but I know it's something. I...

24:24.571 --> 24:27.939
I just don't think I have very long.

24:28.008 --> 24:29.307
Look, I-I didn't start this hospital

24:29.376 --> 24:32.210
because I give a rat's ass about
the American health care system.

24:32.279 --> 24:37.315
I started it to find out what this
disease was before it kills me.

24:37.384 --> 24:41.019
- I don't think...
- Dean Munsch, I'm so sorry.

24:41.088 --> 24:42.854
Well, you
know, the one thing

24:42.923 --> 24:47.626
to take into consideration is that
you lived a long, productive life.

24:49.630 --> 24:54.299
Please, just help me. Zayday, help me.

24:54.368 --> 24:57.068
Please help find the cure. Please.

26:31.031 --> 26:33.298
What the hell are you?

26:33.367 --> 26:35.667
- What's going on?
- Oh! Call the police!

26:35.736 --> 26:38.303
No, don't call the
police; they're morons.

26:38.372 --> 26:39.571
Oh, my God, are you okay?

26:39.640 --> 26:41.139
Number Five wasn't lying.

26:41.208 --> 26:43.775
She <i> was</i> attacked, by this thing

26:43.844 --> 26:46.244
that I think is responsible
for all those murders here

26:46.313 --> 26:48.113
30 years ago!

26:51.385 --> 26:53.251
Oh, come on!

26:53.320 --> 26:56.021
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

26:58.559 --> 27:01.593
From now on, when someone has
just fought off the killer

27:01.662 --> 27:04.162
and they're about to reach
down and pull off the mask

27:04.197 --> 27:07.666
and find out who it is, not
the time to distract them

27:07.734 --> 27:09.267
with a bunch of questions!

27:09.336 --> 27:11.803
Oh, I was so close!

27:18.837 --> 27:21.004
As it turns out, Jumping
Frenchman of Maine Disease

27:21.073 --> 27:23.606
is one of the more treatable
rare disorders we encounter,

27:23.944 --> 27:27.112
so you'll be happy to know your
friend is responding very well.

27:27.181 --> 27:29.147
The key...

27:29.216 --> 27:32.184
The key is removing stimuli
through sensory deprivation

27:32.253 --> 27:34.353
to calm down the neurotransmitters.

27:34.421 --> 27:35.988
Now, we provided an
environment for Randal

27:36.056 --> 27:37.389
where nothing will startle him.

27:39.093 --> 27:41.393
What are you talking about?
He's still screaming.

27:42.529 --> 27:45.797
Perhaps I-I whipped the drapes too fast.

27:45.866 --> 27:48.033
Maybe next time I should
try it slower, right?

27:48.102 --> 27:49.701
Randal?

27:49.770 --> 27:51.803
Randy? Use the towel.

27:51.839 --> 27:53.372
Try the bucket, Randal.

27:53.440 --> 27:54.406
Get... put it on your head.

27:56.410 --> 27:57.676
Good boy, Randy.

27:57.711 --> 28:00.712
You see, Chad, when you've studied
medicine as long as I have,

28:00.781 --> 28:02.881
you come to learn that
sometimes, with treatment,

28:02.950 --> 28:05.851
the symptoms get a little
worse before they get better.

28:05.919 --> 28:07.386
What are you doing?

28:07.421 --> 28:08.854
Nothing.

28:08.922 --> 28:10.756
Well, I'm placing my
hand on your shoulder

28:10.824 --> 28:12.658
in a way that subtly
asserts my dominance.

28:12.726 --> 28:14.059
No...

28:14.128 --> 28:16.094
what is your other hand doing?

28:20.301 --> 28:21.767
Nothing.

28:21.835 --> 28:25.270
What do you say we give
Randal a little privacy, huh?

28:27.975 --> 28:29.207
Come on, everyone.

28:31.011 --> 28:34.112
Well, well, well.

28:34.181 --> 28:39.551
It's a damn good thing you got
Quantico's finest on the case.

28:39.620 --> 28:46.391
Do you know the number one lesson
you learn as a top FBI cadet? Hmm?

28:46.460 --> 28:49.561
Trust your instincts.

28:49.630 --> 28:51.730
And do you know what
my instincts told me

28:51.799 --> 28:54.466
the first time I laid eyes
on that Zayday Williams?

28:54.535 --> 28:59.104
I was like, "This bitch right
here is a stone-cold ho."

28:59.173 --> 29:02.641
She tried to accuse you
of being the killer

29:02.710 --> 29:04.876
just to deflect the
attention off herself.

29:04.912 --> 29:06.712
How do we prove it's not me?

29:06.747 --> 29:09.548
Boom. I got you. Okay?

29:09.616 --> 29:13.819
This is what I learned at Quantico.

29:13.887 --> 29:16.154
And by watching movies about Quantico.

29:16.223 --> 29:18.657
Ooh, and from the hit TV show <i> Quantico,</i>

29:18.726 --> 29:21.093
now in its thrilling second season.

29:21.161 --> 29:23.295
Here's the thing:

29:23.364 --> 29:25.163
If you want to catch a killer,

29:25.232 --> 29:28.734
you got to get inside
the mind of a killer.

29:28.802 --> 29:33.905
Huh? Or in Zayday's case,
underneath the weave of a killer.

29:33.974 --> 29:38.877
And I know just the right person
who can help us do it. Hmm?

29:42.316 --> 29:43.982
Do you think it's
weird that you're, like, 60

29:44.051 --> 29:45.784
and still working at
a teaching hospital?

29:45.853 --> 29:49.087
You should be out of school by now, bro.

29:49.123 --> 29:50.322
You should've graduated.

29:51.892 --> 29:53.125
Yah!

29:57.331 --> 29:59.364
Were you held back or something?

30:10.511 --> 30:13.345
You obviously grew up playing squash.

30:13.380 --> 30:15.313
I grew up playing
Radwell-style water polo.

30:15.382 --> 30:18.216
Similar rules, except the horses
get in the water on horseback.

30:21.054 --> 30:23.588
Actually, I've only been
playing a couple years.

30:26.693 --> 30:28.126
Whose hand is that, bro?

30:28.195 --> 30:29.728
Anonymous donor.

30:31.098 --> 30:32.297
I'm done.

30:32.366 --> 30:33.532
Oh, I'm not.

30:33.600 --> 30:34.733
I'm just getting started.

30:34.802 --> 30:36.334
Oh, and if you think

30:36.403 --> 30:38.336
being a doctor gives you some
sort of advantage over me,

30:38.405 --> 30:40.472
you're wrong. 'Cause guess what.

30:40.541 --> 30:42.874
I'm about to become a doctor, too.

30:42.943 --> 30:44.576
You realize it takes years?

30:46.480 --> 30:48.647
I'm playing the long game.

30:52.986 --> 30:54.352
Back off Chanel.

30:54.421 --> 30:55.754
And back off me.

30:55.823 --> 30:59.157
This hand is capable of a lot
more than playing squash.

31:13.774 --> 31:15.574
She's down at the end.

31:19.313 --> 31:20.879
I'll be watching.

31:20.914 --> 31:22.948
You'll be fine.

31:30.457 --> 31:32.257
Are you my birthday present?

31:33.494 --> 31:37.395
Oh, that guy just threw birthday
cake frosting in my hair!

31:39.266 --> 31:40.232
Ugh!

31:45.205 --> 31:48.139
Hello, Chanel. Dean Munsch.

31:48.208 --> 31:49.741
Chanel #3.

31:49.810 --> 31:55.247
Special Agent Denise Hemphill, FBI.

31:55.315 --> 31:57.482
Those, uh, drawings are real nice.

31:57.551 --> 32:02.320
They're from memory. Memory is all I
have now that I don't have a view.

32:02.389 --> 32:03.822
Glad to hear you're doing well.

32:03.857 --> 32:05.257
We just wanted to ask
you a couple questions.

32:05.282 --> 32:05.724
No.

32:05.759 --> 32:07.425
You were just gaining my trust back

32:07.461 --> 32:10.161
by complimenting my
drawings, and now this

32:10.197 --> 32:12.564
ham-handed segue into
asking about the attacks

32:12.633 --> 32:14.165
that happened at your hospital.

32:14.234 --> 32:16.101
Oh, sookie, sookie now!

32:16.169 --> 32:17.836
Now how'd you know about that?

32:17.905 --> 32:21.273
Tell me, do these attacks
happen in the dead of night

32:21.341 --> 32:22.641
during the graveyard shift

32:22.709 --> 32:24.776
when most of your staff
has already left?

32:24.811 --> 32:26.077
Yes.

32:26.146 --> 32:28.780
And does this killer
wear a mask with horns

32:28.849 --> 32:32.784
and does he or she leave a trail
of green slime wherever he goes?

32:32.853 --> 32:34.986
You know who the killer is, don't you?

32:35.055 --> 32:36.588
I also know that there's a connection

32:36.657 --> 32:39.291
to the Halloween murders
that happened 30 years ago.

32:39.359 --> 32:41.693
The clues are right in
front of your face.

32:41.762 --> 32:43.495
You just don't see them.

32:43.564 --> 32:45.030
Just tell us who the killer is!

32:45.098 --> 32:46.431
Quid pro quo, Chanel.

32:46.500 --> 32:48.700
I'll tell you everything that I know.

32:48.769 --> 32:52.938
But first, I want a transfer to your
hospital and I want a room with a view.

32:53.006 --> 32:55.040
- You're insane.
- I'm not finished.

32:55.108 --> 32:56.374
'Cause I have a list

32:56.443 --> 32:59.110
of some super-high-end
beauty products that I want.

32:59.179 --> 33:01.479
I want a three-ounce bottle
of Lab Systique's SUPER "M"

33:01.548 --> 33:02.948
age-defying face serum.

33:03.016 --> 33:04.950
It really just makes
your skin extra glowy.

33:04.985 --> 33:07.285
And a bottle of Sergio
Jergoni's Luminoquintessence

33:07.354 --> 33:09.387
Color Control Brightening Moisturizer.

33:09.456 --> 33:11.189
It will wake up any skin tone.

33:11.258 --> 33:14.192
Hester, you
know that's impossible!

33:14.261 --> 33:16.728
Those products were discontinued,
like, ten years ago.

33:16.797 --> 33:18.730
You're just gonna have to
start trawling Craigslist

33:18.799 --> 33:21.466
for an estate sale of old French whores.

33:21.535 --> 33:23.702
Until then, you better start praying

33:23.770 --> 33:26.071
that this Green Meanie
doesn't kill again.

33:26.139 --> 33:28.373
Bitch, ain't nobody got time for that!

33:28.442 --> 33:32.477
You better take this damn ChapStick
and tell us what we need to know.

33:32.546 --> 33:33.878
Mm-hmm.

33:36.917 --> 33:40.085
You have my requests.

33:40.153 --> 33:42.921
Now fly away, little birds.

33:42.990 --> 33:44.756
Fly, fly. Fly, fly, fly.

33:50.063 --> 33:52.296
I had a really nice time tonight.

33:52.365 --> 33:53.764
Me, too.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.466
You really had my back.

34:07.247 --> 34:09.413
Surprise.

34:09.449 --> 34:12.289
- What is going on?
- You passed the test.

34:12.393 --> 34:13.893
What test?

34:13.962 --> 34:15.062
You saw somebody

34:15.130 --> 34:17.731
that society had decided
was hideous, and you chose

34:17.800 --> 34:20.000
to look past it and see the
human being underneath.

34:20.069 --> 34:22.702
That is something worth celebrating!

34:22.737 --> 34:25.806
Well... thanks, I guess.

34:25.873 --> 34:28.475
Not you. Him. We were testing him.

34:28.543 --> 34:29.909
- What?
- Tyler,

34:29.978 --> 34:31.745
you have truly learned the lesson

34:31.813 --> 34:33.313
that looks aren't the
only thing that matters.

34:33.382 --> 34:35.681
So we've decided to reward you

34:35.751 --> 34:37.717
by purchasing the laser
for your treatment.

34:37.753 --> 34:39.518
Wait. What?

34:41.523 --> 34:43.422
Wait. How
did you get the money?

34:43.492 --> 34:44.858
I asked Chad for it.

34:44.927 --> 34:47.561
I told him it was for an experimental
weapons-grade pube laser

34:47.629 --> 34:48.995
that was developed by
the Chinese military

34:49.031 --> 34:50.397
to give me a permanently
stubble-free box.

34:50.466 --> 34:53.166
He started writing the check before
I even finished that phrase.

34:53.235 --> 34:55.235
- Thank you.
- No.

34:57.673 --> 34:59.339
So what'd you find out, dick?

34:59.408 --> 35:01.174
No, I-I prefer Richard.

35:01.243 --> 35:03.510
No "Richards" go by "Dick" since Nixon.

35:03.579 --> 35:05.178
I don't know what you're talking about.

35:05.247 --> 35:06.847
I'm calling you "dick"
because your late.

35:06.915 --> 35:09.716
Okay, let's start with the side stuff.

35:09.785 --> 35:11.418
Then let's move on to Dr. Holt.

35:11.487 --> 35:13.620
Okay, well, so, all of the girls

35:13.655 --> 35:14.955
that I showed that picture
of your penis to...

35:14.980 --> 35:15.412
Yeah.

35:15.457 --> 35:17.591
...thought that it looked very nice, but

35:17.659 --> 35:19.926
a few of them commented
about the way it, quote,

35:19.995 --> 35:22.796
"bends at kind of an
extreme right angle."

35:22.865 --> 35:24.564
- Continue.
- Okay.

35:24.600 --> 35:25.866
As for, uh,

35:25.934 --> 35:30.103
Dr. Holt and his mystery
hand, let me just say this.

35:30.172 --> 35:31.972
Bombshell.

35:32.040 --> 35:34.174
<i>I cross-referenced "donated hand"</i>

35:34.243 --> 35:36.643
<i>and "squash champion," and
I came up with a name:</i>

35:36.712 --> 35:38.645
<i>Marshall Winthrop.</i>

35:38.714 --> 35:40.981
<i>Winthrop was this
world-champion squash player.</i>

35:41.016 --> 35:43.083
<i>He won a bronze medal at the Olympics.</i>

35:43.152 --> 35:47.220
<i>But beating his opponents on
the court did not satisfy him.</i>

35:47.289 --> 35:49.656
<i>He hated them for losing.</i>

35:49.725 --> 35:53.760
<i>He considered it a sign of disrespect
to the game he loved so much.</i>

36:00.335 --> 36:03.803
He started cruising for squash
opponents on Craigslist.

36:03.839 --> 36:05.906
<i>He drew them in with
the promise of a game</i>

36:05.974 --> 36:07.307
<i>against one of the world's best.</i>

36:07.376 --> 36:10.744
<i>But all of them lost not only the
game, they lost their lives.</i>

36:10.812 --> 36:13.580
<i>Over 600 poor souls.</i>

36:13.649 --> 36:15.682
Ooh.

36:15.717 --> 36:18.518
Did... did you order me something?

36:18.587 --> 36:21.354
Richard, we eat when we're hungry.

36:21.423 --> 36:22.989
Not when we want to.

36:23.025 --> 36:24.858
- Right.
- Keep going.

36:26.929 --> 36:29.462
<i>So Winthrop
was kind of an idiot,</i>

36:29.531 --> 36:33.567
<i>because eventually the police tracked
him down through the Craigslist ads.</i>

36:33.635 --> 36:36.169
<i>He was arrested before he could finish</i>

36:36.238 --> 36:38.138
<i>what he must have instinctively known</i>

36:38.207 --> 36:41.007
<i>was going to be his last supper...</i>

36:41.076 --> 36:45.278
<i>fois gras rillettes, Cabernet
Franc, rocket salad.</i>

36:45.347 --> 36:49.082
Same menu Brock's hand was
subconsciously writing.

36:51.520 --> 36:54.187
Richard, what did we say
about personal space?

36:54.256 --> 36:55.855
I'm sorry.

36:55.891 --> 37:00.393
He was executed by the state,
but not before he became

37:00.429 --> 37:02.329
a full-body organ donor.

37:02.397 --> 37:04.397
- Oh, my God.
- Uh-huh.

37:04.466 --> 37:06.399
- That means...
- Yes.

37:06.468 --> 37:08.335
Dr. Brock Holt has the hand

37:08.403 --> 37:11.905
of one of the world's most
notorious serial killers.

37:14.843 --> 37:17.010
Shouldn't this guy be under anesthesia?

37:17.079 --> 37:19.179
He's dead.

37:19.248 --> 37:21.014
Practicing some new techniques.

37:21.083 --> 37:24.017
Does it bother you that when you
spank it, you're being totally gay?

37:25.300 --> 37:26.837
- Excuse me?
- And you're celebrating

37:27.008 --> 37:29.208
Palm Sunday with another
bro's hand, so...

37:29.277 --> 37:30.710
These are my hands.

37:30.778 --> 37:33.613
You know, my best bro
in college was gay.

37:33.648 --> 37:35.247
Till he got murdered.

37:35.316 --> 37:36.949
Which brings my next question.

37:37.018 --> 37:39.418
Is it weird for you that the
hand that burps your worm

37:39.487 --> 37:40.786
is the hand of a serial killer?

37:44.292 --> 37:46.058
So now you know my secret.

37:48.429 --> 37:50.396
What are you gonna do about it?

37:50.465 --> 37:52.298
Oh, you'll find out.

37:59.909 --> 38:03.610
This is driving me insane!
Most of Dean Munsch's symptoms

38:03.635 --> 38:06.275
make sense... headaches,
chills, joint pains.

38:06.300 --> 38:07.900
That sounds autoimmune to me.

38:07.968 --> 38:09.501
But this...

38:09.570 --> 38:12.738
funny walking thing...
that's messing me up!

38:12.773 --> 38:14.940
A strange gait?

38:15.009 --> 38:16.675
It's not a symptom for anything.

38:16.744 --> 38:18.477
Okay, can I be totally honest with you?

38:18.546 --> 38:21.947
I am really hungry, and I'm
having a hard time concentrating.

38:22.016 --> 38:23.415
I've been over there scrolling through

38:23.484 --> 38:26.652
Julianna Margulies's best Emmy
looks for the past 45 minutes.

38:26.720 --> 38:30.122
- I know this good Chinese spot.
- The Szechuan Flavor Palace?

38:30.157 --> 38:33.292
No. Last time I ate there, I got sick.

38:33.360 --> 38:36.595
All right, well, you like Ethiopian
food, they got one across the street.

38:36.664 --> 38:39.965
But they close at 9:00,
so we got to hurry up.

38:40.034 --> 38:42.634
That's it.

38:44.205 --> 38:47.206
You haven't been to New
Guinea lately, have you?

38:47.274 --> 38:50.442
As a matter of fact, I have.

38:50.511 --> 38:52.945
You know, it was the last
leg of my book tour.

38:52.980 --> 38:56.281
May agent's assistant...
moron... screwed up,

38:56.350 --> 38:58.650
and I was supposed to do a
book signing in Princeton,

38:58.719 --> 39:00.886
New Jersey, and instead
she put me on a plane

39:00.955 --> 39:03.121
to Papua, New Guinea.

39:03.157 --> 39:07.059
Anyway, that's where I met Swando,

39:07.127 --> 39:10.562
who is a fantastic Papuan medicine man.

39:10.631 --> 39:14.633
And he invited me to this amazing party

39:14.702 --> 39:20.639
where I ate this delicious <i>sort of
custardy, eggy, scrambled thing.</i>

39:20.708 --> 39:23.408
<i>Uh, most delicious
thing I've ever eaten.</i>

39:23.477 --> 39:25.844
What? Is there a problem?

39:25.913 --> 39:27.746
I'm afraid you have kuru.

39:27.815 --> 39:29.915
- What the hell's kuru?
- It's a disease

39:29.984 --> 39:32.317
that cannibalists get
after they eat people.

39:32.386 --> 39:33.685
- I beg your pardon.
- He's right.

39:33.754 --> 39:35.254
It was first discovered in New Guinea

39:35.322 --> 39:37.055
where certain tribes
would eat the bodies

39:37.124 --> 39:38.423
of their deceased family members.

39:38.492 --> 39:40.659
Anyone who consumed the contaminated

39:40.728 --> 39:43.562
brain tissue would contract the disease.

39:43.631 --> 39:48.834
Oh, no. Oh, I just remembered.

39:48.902 --> 39:52.504
Swando's fantastic party was, in fact,

39:52.573 --> 39:54.539
<i>- a funeral.</i>

39:54.575 --> 39:57.509
Okay. Well...

39:57.544 --> 39:59.778
So what's the treatment?

39:59.813 --> 40:04.516
I'm sorry, Dean Munsch, but if
you already have the symptoms,

40:04.585 --> 40:07.619
the literature states that you
have less than a year to live.

40:08.747 --> 40:10.532
There is no cure.

40:10.557 --> 40:11.823
Oh, my God.

40:12.545 --> 40:14.011
This is a secret.

40:14.047 --> 40:15.346
You can tell no one.

40:15.415 --> 40:19.250
No one must know, because
if the board finds out,

40:19.319 --> 40:21.819
they'll think
I'm unfit to run the hospital.

40:21.888 --> 40:24.322
We will keep it a secret.

40:24.390 --> 40:27.191
So then, they finally admitted
they were my parents,

40:27.260 --> 40:29.927
but only on the condition
that I never tell anyone.

40:29.996 --> 40:32.763
But I feel like I can
tell you, because...

40:32.799 --> 40:34.265
I'm your boyfriend.

40:34.334 --> 40:36.934
Say it loud and proud, Chanel #5.

40:37.003 --> 40:39.871
I'm your boyfriend, and
you're my girlfriend.

40:39.906 --> 40:43.841
Thank you so much for seeing the
real me beneath all these tumors.

40:43.877 --> 40:48.212
Thank you for seeing the real me
beneath all of Chanel's lies.

40:55.555 --> 40:57.521
Hey, I forgot to tell you. Yesterday,

40:57.557 --> 40:58.956
I went on OurOwnPrivateldaville.com.

40:59.025 --> 41:01.893
It's one of my favorite
Encyclopedia Brown message boards.

41:01.961 --> 41:03.794
And I let the Encyclopedia
Brown hive mind try

41:03.863 --> 41:05.997
and solve the case of the Green
Meanie who attacked you.

41:06.065 --> 41:07.398
Did you find something?

41:07.467 --> 41:09.233
Whoa, did I ever.

41:09.302 --> 41:12.303
You're not gonna believe this.
It's a game-changer.

41:12.372 --> 41:14.572
Oh, hey, what's happening?

41:14.641 --> 41:16.741
I'm going into surgery now?

41:16.776 --> 41:19.010
That's... that's amazing!

41:19.078 --> 41:22.146
Did you plan this? You
sneaky little girl.

41:22.215 --> 41:25.850
Wait, wait. No, you're not supposed
to have surgery until tomorrow.

41:25.885 --> 41:27.985
Hey, hey, I got to go.
They're wheeling me away.

41:28.054 --> 41:29.887
Look, I love you so much, and I promise

41:29.956 --> 41:32.356
I'm gonna keep loving
you even when I'm hot.

41:33.593 --> 41:34.926
Baby!

41:34.994 --> 41:36.661
Hey, did you guys know anything

41:36.729 --> 41:39.030
about Tyler's surgery being
moved up to tonight?

41:39.098 --> 41:40.164
There's no way that's happening,

41:40.233 --> 41:41.899
because we just left Brock
and Cassidy, and they said

41:41.968 --> 41:43.467
they were going home to
have a handsome contest.

41:44.671 --> 41:46.871
It's where they try on different
outfits and see who's more handsome.

41:46.906 --> 41:51.108
Wait, but... if Brock and
Cassidy weren't there,

41:51.177 --> 41:54.078
then who just wheeled
Tyler into surgery?

41:54.147 --> 41:55.379
Why are you strapping me down?

41:55.448 --> 41:58.215
Aren't I gonna be under
some sort of anesthesia?

41:59.252 --> 42:00.584
Hello?

42:00.653 --> 42:04.188
Holy crap!

42:04.223 --> 42:07.024
Please. I don't... I don't
want to die. Please.

42:07.093 --> 42:10.294
Please. Please, no!

42:13.299 --> 42:15.733
Please, I-I don't want to die.

42:15.802 --> 42:19.203
Please don't...

42:53.973 --> 42:55.673
Oh, my God.

42:55.742 --> 42:58.009
Do you guys know what this means?

42:58.077 --> 43:02.346
I just lost my best chance at
happiness with a really hot guy?

43:02.415 --> 43:04.682
Definitely that.

43:04.751 --> 43:06.751
Ladies...

43:09.389 --> 43:12.529
...we have another serial
killer on our hands.
