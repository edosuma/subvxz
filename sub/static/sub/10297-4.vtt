Another great meal, Peg.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.100
You know, honey,
you're incredible.

01:25.100 --> 01:27.033
You ignore the children,
you neglect the house,

01:27.033 --> 01:28.300
and still you find time

01:28.300 --> 01:32.267
to let the dinner get cold
before you serve it.

01:32.267 --> 01:34.400
How do you do it?

01:34.400 --> 01:37.200
Well, Al, I guess
I care enough about me

Now, listen, Peg,
my week off starts tonight,

01:52.100 --> 01:54.100
so if there's any place
you ever wanted to go,

01:54.100 --> 01:56.434
get the kids, pack up,
and, uh, see you in a week.

01:58.300 --> 01:59.868
Not this year, Al.

01:59.868 --> 02:01.167
Every time
I leave you alone,

02:01.167 --> 02:03.334
you just mess
this house up.

02:04.801 --> 02:07.300
This year, you're going
to do all those things

that you promised to do
when you have the time.

do these chores, who will?

we were talking about going
fishing on your week off?

03:30.701 --> 03:34.334

they jump on your hook.

13:31.801 --> 13:35.701
God. I feel foul.

13:35.701 --> 13:39.067
Oh, I'm so bloated,
even my teeth are swollen.

13:39.067 --> 13:42.434
If I retain
any more water in my body,

13:42.434 --> 13:46.067
they could build a pier
across my butt.

13:48.901 --> 13:50.868
Oh, I need a back rub.

13:50.868 --> 13:52.634
I need
a foot rub.

13:52.634 --> 13:55.501

to yell at.

Where are the men?

13:57.567 --> 13:59.467
I bet they
went fishing.

Isn't that
just like men?

they're never around.

14:27.467 --> 14:28.934
Well, what happened?

14:28.934 --> 14:30.133
We were walking
through the woods

14:30.133 --> 14:31.267
quiet as you please,

14:31.267 --> 14:33.067
when all of a sudden,
the ground started shaking

14:33.067 --> 14:34.801
and something came
crashing through a bush.

14:34.801 --> 14:36.000
I thought it was you, Peg,

14:36.000 --> 14:37.133
but it didn't
want my wallet.

14:41.234 --> 14:43.868
It was a bear.

14:43.868 --> 14:46.701
A big one,
with my name on it.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.434
There he is!

14:48.434 --> 14:49.667
That's a moose.

What do they want?
We have no food.

They don't want
us, Bud.

Let me talk
to your father alone.

can sense when women are, uh...

No, Al, when they're...cycling.

Don't you understand?
They want our women.

Well, then, our women
they shall have.

I'd love to, honey,
but I can't.

15:43.434 --> 15:47.567
There's a moose
filling my gas tank.

15:47.567 --> 15:49.767
I'd hate to interrupt
him right now.

15:49.767 --> 15:53.467
Look at them.

You know, in the old days,

15:57.000 --> 15:59.634
those men would have
gone out there, fought the bear,

15:59.634 --> 16:02.334
come back with supper
and a nice rug.

16:02.334 --> 16:04.334
Now you send them for milk,

16:04.334 --> 16:06.534
they come back
with a leaking carton,

16:06.534 --> 16:09.601

they won't ask directions

16:19.133 --> 16:21.067
when they're lost.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.901
And the way they leave
the toilet seat up.

16:23.901 --> 16:29.033
And the way they ask you
to chip in for the motel room.

16:34.968 --> 16:37.200
So I've heard.

16:39.534 --> 16:44.834

Well, I can, uh, still just
about tell it's a Mercedes.

17:48.834 --> 17:50.234
Of course,
the tires are flat,

17:50.234 --> 17:52.734
but that's probably because
of the porcupine quills.

17:52.734 --> 17:54.701
And that cougar who went
in through the sunroof

17:54.701 --> 17:55.701
only looks
like he's driving,

17:55.701 --> 17:58.434
because I've got the keys.
