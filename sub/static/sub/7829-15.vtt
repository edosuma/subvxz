D'oh!

00:13.179 --> 00:15.557

MAN:
May I offer my condolences

00:28.737 --> 00:30.530
on the untimely passing

00:30.613 --> 00:32.532
of your great Aunt Hortense.

00:32.615 --> 00:33.992
As her only living heirs

00:34.075 --> 00:37.412
you stand to inherit
her entire estate.

00:37.495 --> 00:38.413
(crying)

00:38.496 --> 00:40.457
Poor Aunt Hortense!

00:40.540 --> 00:41.458
(cries)

00:41.541 --> 00:42.459
(softly)
Whoo-hoo!

00:42.542 --> 00:43.793
(crying)

00:43.877 --> 00:45.253
Whoo-hoo!

00:45.336 --> 00:46.838
The only stipulation

00:46.921 --> 00:50.633
is that you spend one night
in a haunted house.

00:50.717 --> 00:52.427
Oh. Isn't that somewhat unusual?

00:52.510 --> 00:55.013
No. It's a standard clause.

00:55.096 --> 00:58.558
Well, luckily,
there's no such thing as ghosts.

01:01.978 --> 01:06.399
Yes, there's no
such thing as ghosts.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.324
(all yawning)

01:16.451 --> 01:17.952
Best night's sleep
I ever had.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.037
Their tap water

01:19.120 --> 01:20.330
tasted better
than ours.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.915
Here you go.

01:21.998 --> 01:24.250
$100 each.

01:24.334 --> 01:26.294
The rest goes
to Ann Landers

01:26.377 --> 01:28.463
as was stipulated
in your Aunt's will.

01:28.546 --> 01:29.464
Hmm?

01:29.547 --> 01:30.799
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:30.882 --> 01:32.467
I must have
continued talking

01:32.550 --> 01:34.427
after you left
the office.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.346
I do that sometimes.

01:36.429 --> 01:38.556
(diabolical laugh)

01:41.518 --> 01:43.853
Oh, my!

01:43.937 --> 01:46.064
What are you going to spend
your money on, kids?

01:46.147 --> 01:48.108
There's a special on tacos
down at The Tacomat:

01:48.191 --> 01:50.068
a hundred tacos for a hundred dollars.
I'm gonna get that.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.861
I'm going to
contribute my money

01:51.945 --> 01:53.905
to the Corporation
for Public Broadcasting.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.156
Tacos?!

01:55.240 --> 01:57.075
Public broadcasting?!

01:57.158 --> 01:59.661
I won't have you kids throwing
your money away like that.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.831
You're both coming downtown with me and
you're gonna put that money in the bank.

02:08.002 --> 02:11.381
Boy, I sure could go for
100 tacos right about now.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.091
No!

02:13.174 --> 02:15.552
Yes, this should provide
adequate sustenance

02:15.635 --> 02:17.220
for the Dr. Who marathon.

02:20.598 --> 02:22.100
MARGE:
You'll feel better knowing

02:22.183 --> 02:23.476
your money's in the hands
of professionals.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.686
(muffled)
Ook Ook.

02:24.769 --> 02:26.604
Are you folks ready
to go ape?

02:26.688 --> 02:27.772
Mom?

02:27.856 --> 02:29.732
A professional
in an ape mask

02:29.816 --> 02:31.317
is still a professional.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.279
And you'll find
that saving for your future

02:34.362 --> 02:36.823
is far more thrilling
than any roller coaster.

02:36.906 --> 02:40.118
Really? Wow! I should have
started a long time ago!

02:40.201 --> 02:42.787
Mm-hmm. Now fill out
these forms.

02:42.871 --> 02:44.622
I'm sure you'll find them
more exciting

02:44.706 --> 02:46.833
than a weekend with Batman.

02:46.916 --> 02:49.002
I got their new Thrifty
Saver savings account.

02:49.085 --> 02:52.380
2.3% annual interest instead
of the normal 2.25.

02:52.463 --> 02:55.091
So a year from now,
I'll have an extra nickel.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.426
I got the account

02:56.509 --> 02:57.886
where you get free
customized checks.

02:57.969 --> 03:00.221
I chose the Hindenburg
flip-book series.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.890
Cool!

03:01.973 --> 03:04.684
Mmm. Checking accounts aren't
really for children, Bart.

03:04.767 --> 03:06.603
No, Mom. I can handle it.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.272
Let's see.
"Pay to the order of..."

03:09.355 --> 03:12.650
Lisa-- one cent and no cents.

03:12.734 --> 03:15.069
And now, the old John Hancock.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.779
There you go.

03:16.863 --> 03:18.114
Thank you.

03:18.198 --> 03:20.074
MILHOUSE:
$1 million!

03:20.158 --> 03:22.243
Thanks, Bart!
I owe you one.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.703
That's a postdated
check remember.

03:23.786 --> 03:25.330
Don't cash it till
the year 10,000.

03:25.413 --> 03:26.873
Okay.

03:26.956 --> 03:29.417
(watch ticks)

03:34.172 --> 03:35.673
Excellent!

03:35.757 --> 03:38.301
As soon as the check clears,
I'll let you go.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.806
-Krusty!
-Krusty!

03:43.890 --> 03:45.558
That's it.
No more autographs.

03:45.642 --> 03:46.893
I gotta go.

03:46.976 --> 03:48.811
They're naming
a new sandwich after me

03:48.895 --> 03:49.812
at my restaurant.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.314
Oh!

03:51.397 --> 03:52.732
That's okay, Bart.
You can share mine.

03:52.815 --> 03:54.651
Quick-- press against me while

03:54.734 --> 03:56.361
the ink's still wet.

03:56.444 --> 03:58.196
No need. I'm going to
get Krusty's autograph

03:58.279 --> 03:59.489
the easy way.

03:59.572 --> 04:01.199
If he wants these 25 cents

04:01.282 --> 04:03.743
he'll have to endorse the check
by signing it on the back.

04:03.826 --> 04:06.037
Then, when my monthly
bank statement comes

04:06.120 --> 04:08.873
I'll get the check back
complete with autograph.

04:08.957 --> 04:10.083
No fuss, no muss.

04:13.378 --> 04:14.921
That's a good plan,

04:15.004 --> 04:17.131
but it won't impress
girls like this.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.925
-Ew!
-Ew!

04:19.008 --> 04:21.302
(laughing heartily)

04:23.805 --> 04:24.722
Lisa's autograph...

04:24.806 --> 04:26.891
Apu's autograph...

04:26.975 --> 04:28.184
Oh, what do you know?

04:28.268 --> 04:29.936
Jimbo's real name is Corky.

04:30.019 --> 04:31.604
And...

04:31.688 --> 04:33.231
Krusty!

04:33.314 --> 04:35.650
Hey! "Cayman Islands
Offshore Holding Corporation"?

04:39.362 --> 04:40.613
Krusty was supposed
to sign this.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.031
Take it back
and make him sign it.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.199
Ah, no, no.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.909
Stamping the back
of a check

04:44.993 --> 04:46.703
is perfectly legal,
little boy.

04:46.786 --> 04:48.413
Many people do it
to save time.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.915
You see, in this case,
instead of writing out his name

04:50.999 --> 04:52.750
Krusty has stamped the name

04:52.834 --> 04:54.168
of his Cayman Islands
Holding Corporation

04:54.252 --> 04:57.088
on the... hmm.

04:57.171 --> 04:58.589
Ah, excuse me a minute.

05:06.848 --> 05:07.765
(chuckles)

05:07.849 --> 05:09.726
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:09.809 --> 05:11.436
I can't divulge information

05:11.519 --> 05:15.565
about that customer's
secret illegal account.

05:15.648 --> 05:18.735
Oh, crap. I shouldn't have
said he was a customer.

05:18.818 --> 05:21.237
Oh, crap! I shouldn't have
said it was a secret.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.905
Oh, crap!

05:22.989 --> 05:25.908
I certainly shouldn't
have said it was illegal.

05:25.992 --> 05:28.411
Ah. It's too hot today.

05:36.961 --> 05:38.463
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

05:38.546 --> 05:40.673
I bought this popcorn
fair and square!

05:42.675 --> 05:43.760
Sorry, the bank is...

05:43.843 --> 05:44.886
Oh, kid!

05:44.969 --> 05:45.928
Gosh, I meant to tell you.

05:46.012 --> 05:47.722
Turns out that Krusty

05:47.805 --> 05:49.682
is one of the biggest
tax cheats in history,

05:49.766 --> 05:52.101
and they nailed him--
all thanks to you.

05:52.185 --> 05:55.938
-(gasps)
-Some might say you're a hero, kid.

05:56.022 --> 05:58.316
Not me, however.
I love Krusty.

06:07.033 --> 06:10.620
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>Krusty the Clown...</i>

06:10.703 --> 06:12.997
<i>was arrested today</i>
<i>for massive tax fraud.</i>

06:13.081 --> 06:15.750
<i>Krusty's years of tax avoision</i>
<i>would never have cah--</i>

06:15.833 --> 06:17.960
<i>Avoision? It's a crime.</i>
<i>Look it up.</i>

06:18.044 --> 06:19.921
<i>-...would never have--</i>
<i>-VOICE (in headset): Evasion.</i>

06:20.004 --> 06:24.717
<i>I don't say "evasion."</i>
<i>I say "avoision."</i>

06:24.801 --> 06:26.677
<i>...would never have come</i>
<i>to light if not for</i>

06:26.761 --> 06:28.930
<i>a crafty, little boy</i>
<i>named Bart Simpson.</i>

06:29.013 --> 06:30.348
Krusty's my hero.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.350
How could I do this
to him?

06:32.433 --> 06:34.394
It is a tragedy
for all us kids,

06:34.477 --> 06:35.895
but, Bart, you can't
beat yourself up.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.855
Yeah. There'll be
enough people

06:37.939 --> 06:39.774
to do that for me
at recess tomorrow.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.781
Oh, I can't go to jail!

06:46.864 --> 06:48.699
I got a swanky lifestyle.

06:48.783 --> 06:50.576
I'm used to the best.

06:50.660 --> 06:53.788
Krusty, this is America.
We don't send our celebrities to jail.

06:53.871 --> 06:55.748
We're just going
to garnish your salary.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.458
Garnish my celery?

06:57.542 --> 06:59.460
Please, Krusty, no jokes.

06:59.544 --> 07:00.962
Who's joking?

07:01.045 --> 07:03.756
Oy! Oh, I don't know
what you're saying.

07:03.840 --> 07:05.883
It all sounds
so crazy to me.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.760
It simply means we'll be
taking part of your salary

07:07.844 --> 07:09.637
until your debt
is repaid.

07:09.720 --> 07:12.056
Say, 75% for 40 years.

07:12.140 --> 07:13.558
But I don't plan
to live that long.

07:13.641 --> 07:15.309
Better make it 95%.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.645
Ah... oh... oy!

07:17.728 --> 07:19.522
<i>The Internal Revenue Service</i>
<i>presents:</i>

07:23.234 --> 07:25.111
<i>(chortling)</i>

07:25.194 --> 07:26.696
<i>Hey, hey, kids!</i>

07:26.779 --> 07:28.614
<i>Now, that the feds</i>
<i>are calling the shots,</i>

07:28.698 --> 07:31.451
<i>this show's got to be</i>
<i>a lot more cost-effective.</i>

07:31.534 --> 07:33.536
<i>So we had to cut down</i>
<i>on the frills</i>

07:33.619 --> 07:36.164
<i>like sets, props, costumes</i>
<i>and Sideshow Mel.</i>

07:36.247 --> 07:38.583
<i>But that doesn't mean</i>
<i>we can't have fun.</i>

07:38.666 --> 07:41.586
<i>For example, I sure wish</i>
<i>somebody would give me</i>

07:41.669 --> 07:42.837
<i>a banana cream pie.</i>

07:42.920 --> 07:44.380
<i>Yeah!</i>

07:44.464 --> 07:47.383
Uh...

07:47.467 --> 07:49.427
I guess we can't afford pies
right now.

07:49.510 --> 07:50.803
Well, throw something!

07:50.887 --> 07:51.971
(screams)

07:52.054 --> 07:54.140
Oh, that corner...

07:54.223 --> 07:56.350
(groaning)

08:02.607 --> 08:06.819
Um, I'll have
four tax burgers,

08:06.903 --> 08:09.906
one I.R.S.-wich,
withhold the lettuce

08:09.989 --> 08:11.866
three dependent-sized sodas,

08:11.949 --> 08:13.367
and a fico-ccino.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.161
Fill out Schedule B.

08:15.244 --> 08:16.245
You should receive
your burgers

08:16.329 --> 08:18.164
in six to eight
weeks.

08:18.247 --> 08:21.000
(mumbling)
Eh, let's see here...

08:21.083 --> 08:23.002
Add Schedule B, divide 53...

08:23.085 --> 08:24.837
take away...

08:24.921 --> 08:27.840
Hey, Marge, what were your
gambling losses last year?

08:27.924 --> 08:30.134
MARGE:
$700.

08:33.137 --> 08:34.764
They took my money.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.224
They wrecked my show.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.017
They buried a bunch
of stinking veterans

08:38.100 --> 08:39.894
in my family plot,

08:39.977 --> 08:42.522
but at least I still got
my memories.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.315
Those are locked up safe

08:44.398 --> 08:46.901
in my fabulous mansion.

08:46.984 --> 08:50.404
And now, lot number 66,
a handmade leather suitcase

08:50.488 --> 08:51.822
carried by the Krustofsky family

08:51.906 --> 08:54.158
upon their arrival
at Ellis Island in 1902.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.910
A priceless heirloom

08:55.993 --> 08:58.496
and historic piece of Krustiana.
What am I bid?

08:58.579 --> 08:59.497
40 cents.

08:59.580 --> 09:00.748
I got 40 cents.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.959
40 cents over there,
40 cents over here.

09:03.042 --> 09:05.044
40 cents over there,
40 cents over here.

09:05.127 --> 09:06.879
Who'll give me 50?
Do I hear 50, 50?

09:06.963 --> 09:08.631
Sold for 40 cents.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.424
40 cents?

09:10.508 --> 09:13.344
Ach! My Grampa Zev
would turn over in his grave

09:13.427 --> 09:14.971
if it wasn't filled
with some veteran.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.683
Lot 67,
32 cartons of pornography.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.685
-Ten cents.
-12!

09:20.768 --> 09:22.103
12 cents to our phone bidder
in Japan.

09:22.186 --> 09:25.565
-Any advance?
-All I brought is a dime.

09:25.648 --> 09:27.275
I didn't know
there would be pornography.

09:27.358 --> 09:29.026
Sold for 12 cents.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.903
Oh, my beloved pornography.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.947
I can't watch this anymore.

09:33.030 --> 09:34.657
I'm going to bed.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.033
How much for Krusty's bed?

09:36.117 --> 09:37.660
-Half a buck!
-Sold!

09:37.743 --> 09:38.703
Goodnight, everybody.

09:38.786 --> 09:39.870
ALL:
Good night, Moe!

09:39.954 --> 09:41.831
(groaning)

09:41.914 --> 09:45.751
And now, lot number 2,380,
Krusty's private plane,

09:45.835 --> 09:47.044
The <i>I'm On A Rolla Gay.</i>

09:47.128 --> 09:48.796
KRUSTY:
But I love that plane.

09:48.879 --> 09:50.923
I used to fly to Vegas
in it with Dean Martin.

09:51.007 --> 09:52.925
One night, he looked out
the window,

09:53.009 --> 09:55.845
and the moon hit his eye
like a big pizza pie.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.471
We wrote a song about it,

09:57.555 --> 10:00.683
but it ended up infringing
on one he recorded years before.

10:00.766 --> 10:02.685
Hey Selma, that plane
would go great

10:02.768 --> 10:03.978
with your
new suitcase.

10:04.061 --> 10:07.106
Nah, I just bought it
to soak my feet in.

10:07.189 --> 10:08.566
(moaning)

10:16.198 --> 10:17.283
Krusty. Hi.

10:17.366 --> 10:19.619
Is it okay
if I sit down here?

10:19.702 --> 10:20.703
Go ahead, kid.

10:20.786 --> 10:21.829
Knock yourself out.

10:21.912 --> 10:23.331
I'm sorry
for all the trouble

10:23.414 --> 10:24.874
I've caused you, Krusty.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.334
But, you know,
my Mom says

10:26.417 --> 10:29.086
God never closes a door
without opening a window.

10:29.170 --> 10:32.131
No offense, kid,
but your Mom's a dingbat.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.966
There's no
silver lining here.

10:34.050 --> 10:36.135
I was a big cheese.

10:36.218 --> 10:37.762
A huge cheese!

10:37.845 --> 10:39.639
But now look at me.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.016
I got to ride the bus
like a schnook!

10:42.099 --> 10:44.769
I got to live in
an apartment like an idiot!

10:44.852 --> 10:47.396
I got to wait in line
with nobodies

10:47.480 --> 10:50.066
to buy groceries
from a failure!

10:50.149 --> 10:52.943
It doesn't matter how you live
or what you did wrong.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.655
As long as you're on TV,
people will respect you.

10:55.738 --> 10:57.615
Respect? Bah!

10:57.698 --> 10:58.866
What good is respect

10:58.949 --> 11:00.785
without the moolah
to back it up?

11:00.868 --> 11:04.246
Everywhere I go,
I see teachers in Ferraris,

11:04.330 --> 11:07.166
research scientists
drinking champagne.

11:07.249 --> 11:09.418
I tried to drink a Coke
on the bus

11:09.502 --> 11:11.253
and they took away my pass!

11:11.337 --> 11:13.964
That's no life
for a famous clown.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.883
Well, if it'll make you
feel any better, Krusty,

11:15.966 --> 11:17.510
you can punch me in the face.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.097
Nah, forget it!

11:21.180 --> 11:22.181
Go home, kid.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.313
-(buzzing in distance)
-(bell dings)

11:29.397 --> 11:30.981
Shiva H. Vishnu!

11:31.065 --> 11:32.858
Where is that noise
coming from?

11:32.942 --> 11:37.405
(Krusty bawling)

11:37.488 --> 11:40.199
Well, I must say I've had
a lovely evening, Agnes.

11:40.282 --> 11:41.784
I don't suppose
I could come in

11:41.867 --> 11:42.785
for a cup of...

11:42.868 --> 11:43.953
Seymour!

11:44.036 --> 11:45.037
Mother...
(gasps)

11:45.121 --> 11:46.080
Superintendent
Chalmers!

11:46.163 --> 11:47.623
Skinner!

11:47.707 --> 11:49.166
What I wouldn't give

11:49.250 --> 11:51.502
for something to interrupt
this awkward moment.

11:51.585 --> 11:54.004
(Krusty bawling)

11:54.088 --> 11:55.464
That will do nicely.

11:56.674 --> 12:00.845
(bawling continues)

12:00.928 --> 12:02.471
You got to hand it to Krusty.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.265
Yeah, even with all his problems

12:04.348 --> 12:08.060
he's still willing to do
something unbelievably dangerous

12:08.144 --> 12:09.812
just to entertain his fans.

12:09.895 --> 12:11.897
-Wow!
-Wow!

12:11.981 --> 12:13.816
Oh, that's my Krusty.

12:13.899 --> 12:16.819
I got a feeling
he'll be all right.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.747
Oh, my God!

12:27.830 --> 12:28.956
Krusty's shoes!

12:29.039 --> 12:30.624
Okay, folks,
show's over.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.042
Nothing to see here.
Show's...

12:32.126 --> 12:33.252
Oh, my God!

12:33.335 --> 12:35.504
A horrible plane crash!

12:35.588 --> 12:37.965
Hey, everybody, get a load
of this flaming wreckage!

12:38.048 --> 12:39.675
Come on,
crowd around.

12:39.759 --> 12:40.676
Crowd around. Don't be shy.
Crowd around.

12:44.513 --> 12:47.975
Ladies and gentlemen,
Krusty the Clown...

12:48.058 --> 12:48.976
is dead.

12:49.059 --> 12:50.060
(all gasp)

12:59.320 --> 13:01.030
I can't believe Krusty
is really gone.

13:01.113 --> 13:02.531
Don't worry, son.

13:02.615 --> 13:04.742
I'm sure he's up
in heaven right now

13:04.825 --> 13:07.870
laughing it up with all
the other celebrities.

13:07.953 --> 13:12.208
John Dillinger, Ty Cobb,
Joseph Stalin...

13:12.291 --> 13:13.459
(sighs)

13:13.542 --> 13:14.710
I wish I were dead.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.714
We're gathered to mourn
the passing

13:18.798 --> 13:20.633
of Herschel Shmoikel Krustofsky

13:20.716 --> 13:22.927
beloved entertainer
and dear friend.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.762
Hello, I'm Troy McClure.

13:24.845 --> 13:27.056
You might remember me from such
show business funerals

13:27.139 --> 13:29.475
as "Andre the Giant:
We Hardly Knew Ye"

13:29.558 --> 13:33.062
and "Shemp Howard:
Today We Mourn a Stooge."

13:33.145 --> 13:35.856
Now, Krusty's closest friend
and sidekick,

13:35.940 --> 13:37.316
Sideshow Mel.

13:38.984 --> 13:40.945
I'll miss you, Krusty

13:41.028 --> 13:43.906
I, and all the other
sideshows...

13:43.989 --> 13:45.699
except Sideshow Bob.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.077
But in the midst
of our sorrow

13:48.160 --> 13:49.954
we can take comfort
in the fact

13:50.037 --> 13:51.872
that your elevated
blood alcohol level

13:51.956 --> 13:53.916
probably helped you
burn up quicker.

13:53.999 --> 13:56.710
Since you left us
no earthly remains,

13:56.794 --> 14:00.506
it is my sad duty to unveil
this simple memorial.

14:03.968 --> 14:06.095
Next in our cavalcade
of celebrity mourners...

14:06.178 --> 14:07.721
Bob Newhart.

14:10.641 --> 14:12.101
(clearing throat)

14:12.184 --> 14:15.563
See, to tell you
the truth, um...

14:15.646 --> 14:17.815
I was-- I'm just
killing time here.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.441
I was waiting
for a...

14:19.525 --> 14:21.026
well, a different--

14:21.110 --> 14:22.194
different funeral
to start.

14:22.278 --> 14:23.737
I'll handle it.

14:23.821 --> 14:25.197
Bob Newhart, everybody!

14:25.281 --> 14:26.866
(applause)

14:28.576 --> 14:30.995
Oh, um...

14:31.078 --> 14:32.830
(coughs)
Although, you know,

14:32.913 --> 14:34.540
though I-I started my career

14:34.623 --> 14:37.167
several years before,
uh, Krusty,

14:37.251 --> 14:38.961
so, you know, I could never

14:39.044 --> 14:41.755
really learn
anything directly from him--

14:41.839 --> 14:43.173
Uh, still...

14:43.257 --> 14:46.969
I think in a way,
in a very meaningful way,

14:47.052 --> 14:48.012
that I, uh...

14:48.095 --> 14:49.555
uh... all of us...

14:49.638 --> 14:51.849
have, uh, have learned

14:51.932 --> 14:53.017
from him.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.019
You know, that is, by...

14:55.102 --> 14:57.563
uh, by being a clown
on television for...

14:57.646 --> 15:00.149
for... for so many years

15:00.232 --> 15:02.568
even, even though

15:02.651 --> 15:04.945
many of us, we-- we didn't--

15:05.029 --> 15:06.822
we didn't watch his show.

15:06.906 --> 15:09.116
-(clearing throat)
-(feedback squeals)

15:09.199 --> 15:11.827
Th-thank you.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.245
-(scattered applause)
-(sniffles)

15:13.329 --> 15:15.122
Well, that's the funeral, folks.

15:15.205 --> 15:17.041
We'll be sitting Shiva
at the Friar's Club

15:17.124 --> 15:18.792
at 7 p.m. and again at 10.

15:18.876 --> 15:21.045
You must be over 18
for the 10.

15:21.128 --> 15:22.546
It gets a little blue.

15:30.387 --> 15:34.892
<i>And so Herschel Krustofsky</i>
<i>is gone, but not forgotten.</i>

15:34.975 --> 15:36.894
<i>Today was the unveiling</i>
<i>of the new Krusty stamp.</i>

15:36.977 --> 15:38.020
<i>Postal patrons</i>
<i>were asked to choose</i>

15:38.103 --> 15:39.813
<i>between two competing designs:</i>

15:39.897 --> 15:42.691
<i>one of Krusty's</i>
<i>heartwarming smile</i>

15:42.775 --> 15:45.235
<i>and one of his fiery death.</i>

15:45.319 --> 15:48.530
<i>By a nearly two-to-one vote,</i>
<i>the smiling Krusty was chosen.</i>

15:48.614 --> 15:53.869
(mechanical groaning)

15:53.953 --> 15:57.331
(groaning continues)

15:57.414 --> 16:00.042
Don't let Krusty's death
get you down, boy.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.919
People die all the time.

16:02.002 --> 16:03.796
Just like that.

16:03.879 --> 16:07.007
Why, you could
wake up dead tomorrow.

16:08.717 --> 16:10.886
Well, good night.

16:10.970 --> 16:11.929
(switch clicks)

16:17.142 --> 16:18.268
(gasps)

16:18.352 --> 16:19.770
Krusty!

16:19.853 --> 16:21.105
(humming)

16:21.188 --> 16:22.856
Mom! I just saw Krusty!

16:22.940 --> 16:24.525
Yes, dear, in your mind.

16:24.608 --> 16:26.068
No, on the street.

16:26.151 --> 16:27.569
On the street in your mind.

16:27.653 --> 16:28.779
Why won't you believe me?

16:28.862 --> 16:30.698
Sweetheart, maybe
you just want Krusty

16:30.781 --> 16:33.283
to be alive so badly,
you think you see him everywhere.

16:33.367 --> 16:36.912
I went through the same thing
when Lyndon Johnson died.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.458
DR. HIBBERT: And these pills
will help with the queasiness.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.130
Krusty?

16:46.213 --> 16:47.381
Doctor Hibbert,
Who was that man?

16:47.464 --> 16:49.925
Now Bart, telling you
would violate

16:50.009 --> 16:51.635
the patient-doctor
privilege,

16:51.719 --> 16:53.721
just as if
I were to tell you

16:53.804 --> 16:56.640
that Jasper here has
five seconds to live.

16:56.724 --> 16:58.058
What'd he say?

16:58.142 --> 16:59.143
He said I'm next.

17:01.061 --> 17:03.022
Am I going crazy?

17:03.105 --> 17:05.649
I'm seeing Krusty everywhere.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.077
Bart, you're seeing Krusty
everywhere because you want

17:17.161 --> 17:19.455
to tell him you're sorry
for causing his death.

17:19.538 --> 17:21.665
Would it help if I told you
you're not responsible for Krusty's death?

17:21.749 --> 17:24.126
Yes. Yes, it would.

17:24.209 --> 17:26.795
Well, I can't. You'll just have to learn
to live with your mental problem.

17:26.879 --> 17:28.714
Wait a minute--
all those things I saw.

17:28.797 --> 17:30.132
There's a connection.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.925
The truck full
of nets and buckets...

17:32.009 --> 17:34.053
the queasy guy...
the lobsters...

17:34.136 --> 17:35.721
they all point
to one thing.

17:35.804 --> 17:36.680
Follow me.

17:42.227 --> 17:44.897
Arr, I've got some customers.

17:44.980 --> 17:46.815
Call me back, Ishmael.

17:46.899 --> 17:48.859
Ahoy there, minnows.

17:50.944 --> 17:53.155
Ahoy, have you
seen this man?

17:53.238 --> 17:54.531
Arr, that's Handsome Pete.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.784
He dances for nickels.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.119
Pete, ye got
some customers.

17:59.203 --> 18:02.915
(playing "Sailor's Hornpipe")

18:05.209 --> 18:07.920
No, we're looking
for this man,

18:08.003 --> 18:08.962
Krusty the Clown.

18:09.046 --> 18:12.007
Mmm. Narr, narr, narr.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.801
It's hopeless, Bart.

18:13.884 --> 18:15.719
We've searched up and down
these docks, from pier one

18:15.803 --> 18:18.680
to that Pier 1
by pier 17.

18:22.434 --> 18:24.103
Lisa, look.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.146
A signature with stars
around it, just like Krusty's.

18:26.230 --> 18:27.940
Rory B. Bellows.

18:28.023 --> 18:29.274
Slip 8. Let's go.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.319
(playing "Sailor's Hornpipe")

18:32.402 --> 18:33.946
Not a quarter.

18:34.029 --> 18:36.949
Darr,
he'll be dancing for hours.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.746
Are you Rory B. Bellows?

18:42.830 --> 18:44.081
Yes.

18:44.164 --> 18:46.792
How about Krusty
the Clown?

18:46.875 --> 18:48.752
Sorry, I don't do impressions.

18:48.836 --> 18:50.546
Well, if you're not Krusty,

18:50.629 --> 18:52.172
how come you have
the exact same signature as him?

18:52.256 --> 18:54.091
I'm Rory Bellows,
I tell you

18:54.174 --> 18:56.969
and I got a lot
of corroborating evidence

18:57.052 --> 18:58.679
over... here

18:58.762 --> 19:00.556
by the throttle!

19:02.307 --> 19:03.934
(chuckling)

19:06.395 --> 19:08.814
Oh... you know you two could
have said something

19:08.897 --> 19:10.732
instead of letting me
make an ass of myself.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.318
Hey, you got a pacemaker scar
just like Krusty.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.362
And Krusty's superfluous
third nipple.

19:15.445 --> 19:18.115
(groaning)

19:18.198 --> 19:20.617
Can't you see I don't want
to be Krusty anymore?

19:20.701 --> 19:22.452
That's why
I faked my death.

19:22.536 --> 19:24.329
But we saw your plane crash.

19:24.413 --> 19:27.124
Yeah, but I wasn't in it.

19:27.207 --> 19:28.500
Just before I hit the mountain

19:28.584 --> 19:30.127
I jumped out of the plane

19:30.210 --> 19:32.588
into a carefully placed net.

19:32.671 --> 19:34.923
(groaning)

19:35.007 --> 19:36.758
So now that we've blown
your cover,

19:36.842 --> 19:38.135
I guess you gotta come back
and do your show again.

19:38.218 --> 19:39.178
Or kill us...

19:39.261 --> 19:40.345
(nervous giggling)

19:40.429 --> 19:42.139
I won't be coming back, kids.

19:42.222 --> 19:43.974
I got a sweet life here.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.726
The sea air
is clearing my lungs.

19:45.809 --> 19:48.604
The sun is toasting my
pale skin a healthy brown,

19:48.687 --> 19:50.856
and most important, I learned

19:50.939 --> 19:53.025
that I don't need money
to be happy.

19:53.108 --> 19:55.485
All that high living
just distracted me

19:55.569 --> 19:57.154
from my true calling in life:

19:57.237 --> 20:01.658
salvaging sunken barges
for scrap iron.

20:01.742 --> 20:04.828
Sorry kids, there's nothing
left for me on dry land anymore.

20:04.912 --> 20:07.247
But Krusty, what about all the kids
who depend on you

20:07.331 --> 20:09.082
to brighten up
their afternoons?

20:09.166 --> 20:11.168
Are you gonna turn
your back on them?

20:11.251 --> 20:12.252
Yes!

20:15.964 --> 20:17.424
Come on, Lis,

20:17.507 --> 20:18.926
Krusty doesn't want our
attention anymore.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.552
Let's go worship
somebody who has

20:20.636 --> 20:22.095
the guts to be
a celebrity.

20:22.179 --> 20:24.389
Yeah, Krusty doesn't
want to be a clown.

20:24.473 --> 20:27.476
He's happy just being
another blue-collar Bozo.

20:27.559 --> 20:28.894
Meh.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.855
Krusty's tired
of having phonies around

20:31.939 --> 20:33.190
pretending
to be his friends.

20:33.273 --> 20:35.192
I'm sure he'll find
plenty of people

20:35.275 --> 20:37.194
who'll like him
for who he is.

20:37.277 --> 20:39.279
Uh... it could happen.

20:39.363 --> 20:41.281
Nah, who needs friends?

20:41.365 --> 20:44.034
The incessant beep of
the global positioning system

20:44.117 --> 20:46.578
is all the companionship
I need.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.288
-(chuckling)
-(beeping)

20:48.372 --> 20:49.373
(screams)

20:51.250 --> 20:53.460
Tell me where you are now,
you bastard!

20:53.543 --> 20:55.837
All right, I admit it.

20:55.921 --> 20:59.091
I miss the phonies,
but that's all I miss.

20:59.174 --> 21:01.301
That and Shirley Jones
and Marty Ingels'

21:01.385 --> 21:02.928
New Year's Eve party.

21:03.011 --> 21:04.638
What about that
great feeling you get

21:04.721 --> 21:06.848
from knowing you're better
than regular people?!

21:06.932 --> 21:10.185
BART: What about being an
illiterate TV clown

21:10.269 --> 21:12.187
who's still more respected
than all the scientists,

21:12.271 --> 21:15.440
doctors and educators in
the country put together?

21:17.818 --> 21:19.486
Yeah!

21:19.569 --> 21:21.697
I'm not going to let those guys
hog all the respect

21:21.780 --> 21:23.365
while I'm out here
in some stinking tub.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.120
That's just what
those eggheads want.

21:28.203 --> 21:29.371
Well, forget it, Poindexter.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.373
'Cause Krusty's back in town!

21:31.456 --> 21:33.333
(cheering)

21:40.590 --> 21:42.134
So, Krusty,
what are you going to do

21:42.217 --> 21:43.677
about your tax problem?

21:43.760 --> 21:45.220
Don't sweat it.

21:45.304 --> 21:48.140
The life of Rory B. Bellows
is insured

21:48.223 --> 21:50.309
for a surprisingly
large amount.

21:53.854 --> 21:57.983
