WEBVTT

00:04.771 --> 00:06.972
All right, people, listen up!

00:06.974 --> 00:08.574
In the spirit of international

00:08.576 --> 00:10.976
touchy-feelyness,
Middleton High is taking part

00:10.978 --> 00:14.146
in a week-long student exchange
program with our sister school

00:14.148 --> 00:16.081
in Yamanuchi, Japan.

00:16.083 --> 00:19.651
Please extend a warm,
mad-dog welcome to Niotaka.

00:21.187 --> 00:24.590
( <i>applause and cheering</i> )

00:26.726 --> 00:28.293
Hi.

00:28.295 --> 00:29.762
( <i>sighing</i> )

00:29.764 --> 00:31.563
Imports are nice.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.098
Sure, the guy's got looks,

00:33.100 --> 00:35.067
attitude, and a
bon-diggity ride,

00:35.069 --> 00:36.969
but can he do this?

00:40.974 --> 00:42.207
Why would he want to?

00:42.209 --> 00:43.742
And now,

00:43.744 --> 00:46.745
the name of the Middleton
student who will journey

00:46.747 --> 00:48.914
to the home
of Sumo and anime...

00:48.916 --> 00:50.649
Ron Stoppable.

00:51.818 --> 00:53.185
Huh. Me?

00:53.187 --> 00:54.720
Let me get this straight.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.321
We get motorcycle hotness,
and they get Stoppable?

00:56.323 --> 00:58.090
Any way we can make this trade
permanent?

00:58.092 --> 00:59.091
Now keep in mind,

00:59.093 --> 01:01.026
Stoppable, the next seven days,

01:01.028 --> 01:02.795
you are a cultural ambassador.

01:02.797 --> 01:05.597
You represent this school,
this city, and this nation.

01:05.599 --> 01:06.932
Don't worry, Mr. B.

01:06.934 --> 01:09.868
I am a master at the delicate
art of diplomacy.

01:11.337 --> 01:13.172
But if they push any
of that raw fish on me,

01:13.174 --> 01:14.139
I swear I'll chuck.

01:14.141 --> 01:15.574

Okay Rufus, looks like

02:18.372 --> 02:19.805
we've got the essentials packed.

02:19.807 --> 02:20.839
You're taking a duffel

02:20.841 --> 02:22.808
full of nachos to Japan?

02:22.810 --> 02:23.976
Just for the plane.

02:23.978 --> 02:25.144
I'll restock
at the Bueno Nacho Express

02:25.146 --> 02:26.145
in the Tokyo airport.

02:26.147 --> 02:27.279
You're really going to soak up

02:27.281 --> 02:28.280
the local culture, aren't you?

02:28.282 --> 02:30.415
Within reason.

02:30.417 --> 02:32.117
( <i>loud slurping sound</i>)

02:32.952 --> 02:34.052
( <i>girls screaming</i> )

02:34.054 --> 02:36.221
Ladies, ladies, please.

02:36.223 --> 02:38.257
You'll only be Ron-less
for one week.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.058
Be brave.

02:42.729 --> 02:44.129
Oh, come on.

02:44.131 --> 02:45.330
Show me some love.

02:45.332 --> 02:47.199
Look at them fight
over that Hirotaka guy.

02:47.201 --> 02:48.267
It's pathetic.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.935
So the dude's got
a smooth ride.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.670
Big whoop.

02:55.808 --> 02:57.876
WOMAN:
Unstoppable-san.

02:57.878 --> 02:59.111
<i>Konichiwa.</i>

02:59.113 --> 03:01.480
I am Yodi
from the Yamanuchi school.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.048
It is my honor
to guide you this week.

03:03.050 --> 03:04.116
( <i>weak chuckle</i>)

03:04.118 --> 03:05.384
Believe me,

03:05.386 --> 03:08.253
the honor is, like,
totally mine.

03:09.322 --> 03:10.989
This is where you go to school?

03:10.991 --> 03:12.791
The campus is located
on the peak

03:12.793 --> 03:13.825
of Mount Yamanuchi.

03:16.429 --> 03:19.131
So, we just wait here
for a helicopter or what?

03:19.133 --> 03:21.800
You are funny, Stoppable-san.

03:21.802 --> 03:23.869
Of course, it will be
our honor to walk.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.945
The Nachos are safe.

03:32.947 --> 03:35.147
Go on without me.

03:35.149 --> 03:37.216
But we are almost there,
Stoppable-san.

03:37.218 --> 03:39.918
It will be my honor to pass out.

03:45.091 --> 03:46.325
( <i>gasps</i>)

03:47.994 --> 03:50.796
Check... it... out.

04:01.374 --> 04:04.109
( <i>martial arts yells</i> )

04:06.779 --> 04:07.980
Is this a public school?

04:07.982 --> 04:09.081
MAN:
Ron Stoppable.

04:09.083 --> 04:10.415
We have awaited your arrival.

04:10.417 --> 04:12.384
I am Sensai.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.820
Yamanuchi
is no ordinary school.

04:14.822 --> 04:17.222
We are a secret training ground

04:17.224 --> 04:19.791
for the ancient art of Ninjitsu.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.893
A secret Ninja school.

04:21.895 --> 04:24.196
Wait, is it a public secret
Ninja school?

04:34.540 --> 04:36.908
Oh. Check out
the Sheik.

04:36.910 --> 04:40.078
Are we the only two girls in
Middleton not crushing on him?

04:43.516 --> 04:45.817
You think you're pretty
slick stuff,

04:45.819 --> 04:46.818
don't you, Chief?

04:48.788 --> 04:50.055
Excuse me.

04:51.357 --> 04:54.126
Maybe I need to teach you
some manners.

04:54.128 --> 04:55.394
What's rude about "excuse me"?

04:55.396 --> 04:57.229
To fight you,
would prove nothing.

04:57.231 --> 04:58.230
That's very zen.

04:58.232 --> 04:59.364
Rick won't get it.

04:59.366 --> 05:00.565
I don't get it.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.267
It is my wish to spare you

05:02.269 --> 05:04.569
the embarrassment
of a humiliating defeat.

05:09.542 --> 05:11.209
( <i>grunting</i>)

05:15.181 --> 05:17.082
( <i>grunting</i>)

05:18.818 --> 05:20.485
( <i>gasping</i>)

05:28.594 --> 05:30.362
You know...

05:30.364 --> 05:31.563
( <i>laughing</i>)

05:31.565 --> 05:33.899
that Hirotaka does have
really cool hair.

05:33.901 --> 05:36.101
I am so digging
his hair right now.

05:36.103 --> 05:39.237
Our school has a long
and honored history.

05:39.239 --> 05:42.407
It was founded
in the Year 338 A.D.

05:42.409 --> 05:44.443
by the great warrior, Tushumir

05:44.445 --> 05:47.145
who carved this monastery
from the mountain

05:47.147 --> 05:49.348
using only this sword,

05:49.350 --> 05:51.083
the Lotus Blade.

05:51.085 --> 05:52.317
MAN: No. What?!

05:52.319 --> 05:53.485
You say too much, Master Sensai.

05:53.487 --> 05:54.886
He is an outsider.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.021
No, it's cool.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.556
I'm way good
at keeping secrets.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.124
Unless,
it's something really juicy.

05:59.126 --> 06:01.626
Fugusima,
your rudeness dishonors us all.

06:01.628 --> 06:03.061
But Master...

06:03.063 --> 06:05.330
I warn you:
do not further shame yourself.

06:05.332 --> 06:08.100
Honored guest,
I must beg your forgiveness.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.369
Dude, please, nothing but love.

06:15.007 --> 06:16.108
This will be your room.

06:16.110 --> 06:17.509
So does the bed flip out

06:17.511 --> 06:19.177
from the wall or something?

06:19.179 --> 06:20.278
( <i>giggling</i>)

06:20.280 --> 06:22.914
That is the bed,
Stoppable-san.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.082
Call me Ron-san.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.016
You should sleep.

06:25.018 --> 06:26.351
Wake-up is
at 4:00 sharp.

06:26.353 --> 06:28.320
4:00? In the afternoon?

06:28.322 --> 06:30.021
Yeah. Okay,
that sounds do-able.

06:30.023 --> 06:31.490
You are so funny

06:31.492 --> 06:33.925
with your American-style jokes,
Stoppable-san.

06:33.927 --> 06:35.227
Good night.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.437
( <i>gong sounding</i> )

06:46.672 --> 06:50.075
Ah... ooh...

06:50.077 --> 06:52.644
SENSAI: Today we begin
with the Dragon Claws.

06:52.646 --> 06:53.945
Be quick,

06:53.947 --> 06:55.347
be silent. Go.

06:55.349 --> 06:56.348
Hey, wait up.

06:57.383 --> 06:59.284
Welcome to Yamanuchi...

( <i>laughing</i>)

08:01.581 --> 08:02.781
Oh, man.

08:02.783 --> 08:04.483
Even in Japan?
( <i>giggling</i>)

08:08.621 --> 08:11.156
Hirotaka. Hi. I'm...

08:11.158 --> 08:12.224
Kim Possible.

08:12.226 --> 08:13.191
I know.

08:13.193 --> 08:14.259
You do? Oh.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.328
Hey I saw you play Brick
back there.

08:16.330 --> 08:18.029
It was, um... spankin'.

08:18.031 --> 08:19.264
Mantis Kung Fu rocks.

08:19.266 --> 08:21.533
You know the Mantis style?

08:21.535 --> 08:23.602
Well, I wouldn't say know.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.070
I might say dabbled in.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.071
Show me.

08:26.073 --> 08:27.506
What? Right here.

08:27.508 --> 08:28.673
Oh, I-I don't...

08:33.546 --> 08:37.315
I will see you, Kim Possible.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.552
I'm a sheep, a crushing sheep.

08:41.721 --> 08:45.323
RON: Ow... ow... ow...
not so fast.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.391
Listen, maybe I'm not cut out

08:46.393 --> 08:48.193
for this Ninja School
stuff, Yori.

08:48.195 --> 08:50.295
It has been harder
for you than Rufus-san.

08:59.539 --> 09:00.705
( <i>gulping</i> )

09:00.707 --> 09:02.307
( <i>burps</i> )

09:02.309 --> 09:03.642
But you must not give up.

09:03.644 --> 09:05.777
Even a mighty river
was once a stream.

09:05.779 --> 09:07.345
But I'm a trickle.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.581
I believe in you,
Stoppable-san.

09:09.583 --> 09:10.782
Good night.

09:12.485 --> 09:15.620
Ahh, call me Ron-san.

09:17.623 --> 09:20.759
Yeah! I love this place.

09:32.204 --> 09:35.106
Ron-san is going to sleep
like a baby, tonight.

09:35.108 --> 09:36.374
( <i>whimpering</i> )

09:36.376 --> 09:38.710
No, I don't mean waking up
every two hours

09:38.712 --> 09:40.145
crying for my mama.

09:40.147 --> 09:41.580
( <i>bell ringing</i>)

09:41.582 --> 09:42.781
I'm up, I'm up, all right.

09:42.783 --> 09:43.815
Where's the Dragon Course?

09:43.817 --> 09:44.816
I'm there.

09:44.818 --> 09:45.817
Where is everyone?

09:45.819 --> 09:47.552
( <i>chattering</i> )

09:47.554 --> 09:49.154
It is the alarm.

09:49.156 --> 09:50.555
The Lotus Blade
has been stolen.

09:54.727 --> 09:56.861
Stoppable-san...
sit.

09:56.863 --> 09:59.731
Look, if this is about the
damages to the school...

09:59.733 --> 10:03.101
I wish your help
in recovering the Lotus Blade.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.603
My help?

10:04.605 --> 10:08.173
but I have been flunking every
class since I got here.

10:08.175 --> 10:10.875
The Lotus Blade
is no ordinary sword.

10:10.877 --> 10:12.877
In the wrong hands

10:12.879 --> 10:13.845
it could be very dangerous.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.146
( <i>sniffing</i> )

10:15.148 --> 10:16.314
Monkey?

10:16.316 --> 10:18.149
Monkey...
Lord Monkey Fist.

10:18.151 --> 10:19.784
My arch foe.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.220
Hey. I just realized I have
my own personal arch foe.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.655
That's pretty cool.

10:23.657 --> 10:26.791
This Monkey Fist is now more
powerful than ever before.

10:26.793 --> 10:28.660
The sword in the wrong hands...

10:28.662 --> 10:30.662
I fear for us all.

10:30.664 --> 10:31.863
You fear?

10:31.865 --> 10:33.264
Oh man, look, due respect,

10:33.266 --> 10:35.800
I have some very deep-rooted
monkey issues.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.535
I know.

10:37.537 --> 10:40.205
You were not chosen to come
to Yamanuchi by accident.

10:40.207 --> 10:43.341
Tochimur, the warrior who
founded our school

10:43.343 --> 10:46.311
was the original master
of Tae-shing Pequa.

10:46.313 --> 10:47.545
Funky kung fu!

10:47.547 --> 10:49.547
I knew there was something
about this place.

10:49.549 --> 10:52.717
Since then, there have
been only two individuals

10:52.719 --> 10:54.285
who have been exposed

10:54.287 --> 10:55.887
to the mystical monkey power.

10:55.889 --> 10:58.156
<i>Monkey Fist</i>

10:58.158 --> 10:59.824
<i>and you.</i>

10:59.826 --> 11:03.728
You, and the Lotus Blade
are connected by destiny.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.263
This has got to be a mistake.

11:05.265 --> 11:06.931
I can't even get
a grain of rice

11:06.933 --> 11:08.199
from the master lunch lady.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.434
Look, I wish I could help,

11:09.436 --> 11:10.835
but you're sick
with ninjas here.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.871
Do as your heart tells you.

11:12.873 --> 11:14.572
Can you hear it, too?

11:16.542 --> 11:17.876
Monique,

11:17.878 --> 11:20.545
thank you for letting me use
your Club Banana discount.

11:20.547 --> 11:23.481
I will see you around.

11:25.885 --> 11:27.419
Yeah.

11:27.421 --> 11:28.653
Making Hirotaka
feel right at home?

11:28.655 --> 11:29.888
Okay, I admit it.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.523
I am now officially crushing.

11:31.525 --> 11:33.525
I know.
How can you not?

11:33.527 --> 11:35.493
Well, you two would make
a totally cute couple.

11:35.495 --> 11:38.396
Come on, you two
are truly, madly.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.432
Kim, best friend says,
"Go for it."

11:40.434 --> 11:43.268
Monique, I insist.

11:45.237 --> 11:47.272
Nachos are history and so am I.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.506
Come on, Rufus.

11:49.341 --> 11:50.508
Yori?

11:50.510 --> 11:52.377
I'm saddened to say
that Yori is missing.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.945
Missing?
Missing how?

11:53.947 --> 11:57.315
Since you refused the task
of recovering the lotus blade,

11:57.317 --> 11:58.950
she seized the honor.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.852
Her footprints...

12:00.854 --> 12:03.354
the ground here,
tells the story.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.490
A great struggle,
many warriors.

12:05.492 --> 12:06.991
And one Yori.

12:06.993 --> 12:07.859
The hour grows late,

12:07.861 --> 12:09.360
Stoppable-san.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.329
You have a plane to catch.

12:11.331 --> 12:12.564
I'm going to miss that plane.

12:18.804 --> 12:19.938
Come on, Rufus.

12:19.940 --> 12:21.539
Time to kick some monkey tail.

12:22.441 --> 12:23.475
Ow!

12:23.477 --> 12:25.677
Outsider, wait.

12:25.679 --> 12:26.811
Look, Dude-san,

12:26.813 --> 12:28.379
I don't have time
for your attitude.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.281
Allow me the honor
of going with you.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.017
Well... I suppose we could
use someone who knows the area.

12:33.019 --> 12:34.619
But let's get one thing
straight.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.588
When it comes to saving
the beautiful girl

12:36.590 --> 12:38.623
and winning her affections,
that's my honor.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.824
Got it?

12:39.826 --> 12:41.459
Fair enough, outsider.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.328
Fair enough.

12:45.998 --> 12:47.265
The trail leads this way.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.266
Man, it's like

12:48.268 --> 12:49.267
an ice sauna up here.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.468
Volcanic hot springs.

12:50.470 --> 12:51.903
Many seek their healing powers.

12:57.643 --> 12:58.910
I will see how far
this trail leads.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.411
Watch my back.

13:00.413 --> 13:02.113
Consider it watched.

13:14.627 --> 13:17.462
Rufus. Ru...?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.963
Oh, Fuji.

13:18.965 --> 13:20.698
Why is it always monkeys?

13:20.700 --> 13:23.835
Why can't I ever be attacked
by crazed super models?

13:32.878 --> 13:34.345
Hey...

13:34.347 --> 13:36.948
Not too shabby, check me out.

13:44.557 --> 13:48.092
Outsider, this way.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.364
Talk to me, Wade.

13:53.366 --> 13:55.066
I need coordinates
on the target ASAP.

13:55.068 --> 13:56.467
I don't know about this, Kim.

13:56.469 --> 13:58.703
Wade, this is serious.
Okay.

13:58.705 --> 14:01.172
Target directly below at 5:00.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.047
Kim, are you sure
you want to go there?

14:09.049 --> 14:10.582
Cut the chatter, Wade,
I'm working.

14:13.919 --> 14:16.487
Oh, Hirotaka.

14:16.489 --> 14:18.022
What a coincidence
running into you here.

14:18.024 --> 14:19.824
Konichiwa, Kim.

14:19.826 --> 14:21.860
Listen, the Bravos are playing
at the civic center tonight

14:21.862 --> 14:23.862
and guess who scored
some tickets?

14:23.864 --> 14:25.964
I was thinking that maybe...
Hey, Kim.

14:25.966 --> 14:28.566
Actually, I swung tickets, too.

14:28.568 --> 14:30.969
This is great,
we will all three go together.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.704
It will be my honor.

14:34.940 --> 14:35.974
What are you doing here?

14:35.976 --> 14:36.975
What am I doing here?

14:36.977 --> 14:38.042
You insisted.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.143
Who said "Go for it?"

14:39.145 --> 14:41.145
Who was all "truly madly"?

14:41.147 --> 14:42.547
I don't even know
what that means.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.581
You said it.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.550
I know, I didn't mean it.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.694
We will cover more ground
if we split up.

14:59.598 --> 15:02.533
( <i>cackling</i>)

15:02.535 --> 15:05.470
( <i>louder cackling</i> )

15:05.971 --> 15:08.039
( <i>cackling laughter</i> )

15:08.041 --> 15:13.645
At last, the ultimate weapon
is where it belongs.

15:18.951 --> 15:20.518
Stoppable-san.

15:20.520 --> 15:21.786
Call me Ron-san.

15:24.456 --> 15:26.758
Come on, we have
to find Fukushima

15:26.760 --> 15:27.859
and get off Monkey Mountain.

15:27.861 --> 15:29.627
Fukushima? No.

15:29.629 --> 15:31.996
He told Monkey Fist the location
of the lotus blade.

15:31.998 --> 15:33.164
He has betrayed us.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.833
But he's the one
that led us down here.

15:35.835 --> 15:37.735
That means this whole thing is...
A trap.

15:37.737 --> 15:39.804
Sorry, outsider.

15:41.507 --> 15:44.609
You and I are the only
people on Earth

15:44.611 --> 15:46.844
capable of unleashing the power

15:46.846 --> 15:47.979
of the lotus blade.

15:47.981 --> 15:50.748
Once I have destroyed you,

15:50.750 --> 15:52.517
there will be only me.

15:52.519 --> 15:57.188
( <i>laughing maniacally</i>)

16:02.294 --> 16:05.563
I'd say things
are about to heat up.

16:07.633 --> 16:11.202
This could be a bad career move
for you, Fukushima.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.737
How so, outsider?

16:12.739 --> 16:14.906
I mean, how's this going
to look on your transcripts?

16:14.908 --> 16:16.507
You know, this will
keep you out

16:16.509 --> 16:17.775
of a good Ninja college
for sure.

16:17.777 --> 16:19.610
But I was hoping to gain
early admission.

16:19.612 --> 16:22.013
Don't worry, I'll write you
a letter of recommendation,

16:22.015 --> 16:24.215
and by then, I will
have led an army

16:24.217 --> 16:26.050
of ninja monkeys into battle.

16:26.052 --> 16:30.221
Under the power of the lotus
blade, the world will fall...

16:30.223 --> 16:34.158
making me, supreme monkey ruler.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.694
( <i>cackling, monkeys screeching</i>)

16:43.068 --> 16:45.603
He thinks he's such
a smart monkey.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.171
I'm sorry it ends like this,
Stoppable-san.

16:47.173 --> 16:48.606
It's not over yet, Yori.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.675
I'm like a cat with nine lives.

16:50.677 --> 16:51.576
I keep the... ow!

16:51.578 --> 16:54.612
Ow! Hot! Hot! Ow!
Hot! Hot!

16:54.614 --> 16:56.748
( <i>pants</i>)

16:56.750 --> 16:58.616
Monkey Fists thinks he and I

16:58.618 --> 17:00.752
are the only ones exposed
to mystical monkey power,

17:00.754 --> 17:02.954
he's forgetting
there is one other.

17:08.293 --> 17:10.294
The lotus blade!

17:12.698 --> 17:15.299
That rodent has
the mystical monkey power.

17:15.301 --> 17:17.135
Ninjas, attack!

17:18.270 --> 17:20.938
Uh, Rufus, when you
get a chance.

17:49.168 --> 17:51.102
Thanks, Monkey Ninja, buddy.

17:51.104 --> 17:53.871
Ha. Who's the smart monkey now?

17:53.873 --> 17:55.339
They must not escape.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.194
Hurry, Stoppable-san.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.901
Here are the seats.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.208
Look, Monique,
this is ridiculous.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.143
We can't be feuding
over the same guy.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.344
We're friends.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.213
Kim, I am so relieved
to hear you say that.

18:35.215 --> 18:38.082
I was thinking the same thing.

18:38.084 --> 18:39.383
Cool.

18:39.385 --> 18:40.918
Because I think Hirotaka
really likes me,

18:40.920 --> 18:42.053
so if you...
Likes you?

18:42.055 --> 18:43.721
You better wake up
from that dream, girl.

18:48.727 --> 18:50.795
Monique.
What ya gonna do?

18:50.797 --> 18:52.830
Want to start with some of that
chump teen hero kung fu?

18:52.832 --> 18:54.298
Bring it here.

18:54.300 --> 18:55.833
( <i>grunting</i>)

18:57.202 --> 18:58.169
They will be coming for us.

18:58.171 --> 19:00.338
Let's see what
this thing can do.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.839
No, nope, too pointy.

19:01.841 --> 19:02.974
Don't know what that is.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.242
Hey, I could use that camping.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.209
I could 'cause...

19:05.211 --> 19:06.410
Yes!

19:06.412 --> 19:09.147
Hop on, everybody. Whoa!

19:15.020 --> 19:16.787
The icebergs will
take us to safety.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.397
( <i>yelling</i> )

19:30.769 --> 19:32.303
I grow impatient.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.704
Hand over the sword.

19:33.706 --> 19:36.707
Never. Not in
a hundred, million,

19:36.709 --> 19:37.742
billion y... oh!

19:43.448 --> 19:44.749
The lotus blade!

19:44.751 --> 19:46.083
( <i>screams</i> )

19:46.085 --> 19:47.885
( <i>cries</i> )

19:47.887 --> 19:49.854
Okay, real quickly,
I want to point out

19:49.856 --> 19:51.122
that it wasn't my fault.

19:51.124 --> 19:52.723
He did it.

19:52.725 --> 19:54.692
( <i>growls</i> ):
Attack!

19:54.694 --> 19:57.128
( <i>horn blows</i> )

19:57.963 --> 19:59.263
Master sensai.

19:59.265 --> 20:01.098
( <i>sing-songy</i>):
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.100
They're bad, you're sad.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.068
They're bad.

20:04.070 --> 20:05.169
You're sad.

20:05.171 --> 20:07.872
Let's just bring it, shall we?!

20:07.874 --> 20:10.208
( <i>screeching</i> )

20:10.210 --> 20:12.810
Outsider, without the lotus
blade you are nothing.

20:17.182 --> 20:18.382
Want some more?

20:28.193 --> 20:31.495
Hah. It is my honor
to defeat you.

20:32.864 --> 20:33.464
Retreat!

20:37.736 --> 20:41.305
Sensai, I am really sorry
about losing the lotus blade.

20:41.307 --> 20:44.208
So long as your heart
remains pure,

20:44.210 --> 20:46.777
the blade will always
know the way home.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.112
Call it back to you.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.181
Call it?
But I mean, how...?

20:50.183 --> 20:52.516
Magic sword, here, boy.

20:52.518 --> 20:55.152
( <i>kissing</i> )

21:01.526 --> 21:03.461
Uh, my bad.
I can pay for that, really.

21:03.463 --> 21:05.496
You just go ahead,
you put that on my tab.

21:05.498 --> 21:08.532
Our gratitude runs, Stoppable.

21:08.534 --> 21:11.068
At Yamanochi, you will
always be remembered

21:11.070 --> 21:13.371
as a warrior hero.

21:14.373 --> 21:17.241
Boo-ya!
A warrior hero, score!

21:17.243 --> 21:20.478
But the true nature
of the ninja school

21:20.480 --> 21:22.346
must be kept secret.
Huh?

21:22.348 --> 21:24.015
You must never tell anyone

21:24.017 --> 21:25.216
of your adventure here,

21:25.218 --> 21:26.517
not ever.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.853
Man, that tanks.

21:29.988 --> 21:31.789
I will miss you.

21:31.791 --> 21:33.924
Good bye, Ron-san.

21:35.160 --> 21:36.460
( <i>whistles</i>)

21:36.462 --> 21:38.529
Uh, any chance of a warrior hero

21:38.531 --> 21:40.464
getting a lift to the airport?

21:40.466 --> 21:43.334
Always with
the American-style jokes.

21:43.336 --> 21:44.402
Naturally,

21:44.404 --> 21:46.270
it will be a great
honor to walk.

21:46.272 --> 21:48.039
Yeah, I knew that.

21:50.909 --> 21:51.909
Take care, Hirotaka.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.177
Stay in touch.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.945
Thank you.
But I must say goodbye

21:54.947 --> 21:56.447
to my number one girlfriend.

21:57.949 --> 22:00.051
Bye, Hiro, darling.

22:02.621 --> 22:04.655
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.190
We were ferociously whacked

22:06.192 --> 22:08.292
to risk our friendship like that
for a crush.

22:08.294 --> 22:10.961
Even with one
with hair that cool.

22:10.963 --> 22:12.430
The boys are back in town!

22:12.432 --> 22:14.432
So spill.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.367
How was Japan?
Tell all.

22:16.369 --> 22:20.104
Oh, you know, same old same old.
