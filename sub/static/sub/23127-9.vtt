10:19.780 --> 10:22.886
- You can make it through this.
- Why?

10:22.920 --> 10:26.015
So I can screw up again?

10:26.050 --> 10:29.054
Make your life worse
like I always have?

10:30.690 --> 10:32.920
Not always.

[overlapping shouting, gunfire]

10:43.670 --> 10:45.160
What do we got here?

10:45.210 --> 10:47.531
Cleared a whole trench
by himself.

10:47.580 --> 10:49.207
I've never seen so much blood.

10:49.240 --> 10:51.971
How many entry wounds are there?

10:52.010 --> 10:54.980
Lost count at a dozen.

10:55.020 --> 10:57.079
You deal with him.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.684
I'm afraid you're stuck with me.

11:03.190 --> 11:06.023
Let's see what we have here.

11:08.830 --> 11:11.094
[gasp]
Dear Lord...

11:13.700 --> 11:15.134
They'll be gone west by morning.

Don't go wasting
good morphine on a dead man.

11:22.950 --> 11:24.679
Take them out.

11:24.710 --> 11:25.905
What?

11:25.950 --> 11:28.044
The bullets.
You heard him.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.549
I'm dead anyway.
Get them out!

11:35.590 --> 11:38.628
[labored breathing]

11:48.700 --> 11:51.704
[groaning]

12:02.420 --> 12:03.512
Wait here.

12:11.530 --> 12:14.693
Uh-uh, I'm not babysitting
the meatsicle.

12:14.730 --> 12:15.959
It's not like he's gonna
throw a rager.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.560
He's not getting any better,
and he needs food.

12:18.600 --> 12:20.466
Oh, are we talking takeout
that comes in a bag,

12:20.500 --> 12:22.559
or the kind with a pulse?

12:22.600 --> 12:24.068
You know what?
Never mind.

12:24.110 --> 12:27.102
Bring him a whole herd
of cattle. What do I care?

12:30.480 --> 12:31.606
[door slams]

12:31.650 --> 12:35.518
Hey, Sally.

12:35.550 --> 12:37.746
- Boner?
- You seen Stevie?

12:37.790 --> 12:38.916
[Sally]
We know about Boner.

12:38.950 --> 12:42.284
- Boner, he's still here!
- Where, where is he?

12:42.320 --> 12:44.379
But Stevie shredded you.

12:44.430 --> 12:46.159
That's news to me.
Who told you that?

12:46.190 --> 12:48.158
[Reaper]
He shredded them, Sally.

12:48.200 --> 12:49.656
Dylan, Boner.

12:49.700 --> 12:51.464
Stevie lied to you.

12:52.940 --> 12:54.738
Someone who should know better.

12:56.170 --> 12:57.831
Are you okay?

12:57.870 --> 12:59.508
Yeah.

12:59.540 --> 13:00.769
"Cause you don't look okay.

13:00.810 --> 13:03.347
No, I'm fine, um...

13:04.650 --> 13:08.541
So-So, the other guys
at Jasper's...

13:08.580 --> 13:10.344
Stevie didn't shred any of them?

13:10.390 --> 13:11.949
The only one Stevie shredded
was Dylan,

13:11.990 --> 13:13.856
and that was to protect you.

13:13.890 --> 13:16.882
Who told you that stuff
about Stevie?

13:19.130 --> 13:22.862
A ghost reaper.
That's who told me.

13:22.900 --> 13:25.164
You never saw him at Jasper's?

13:25.200 --> 13:26.599
No.

13:26.630 --> 13:28.189
Is he after Stevie?

Not anymore.

13:35.810 --> 13:37.608
Good.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.119
If you see Stevie, tell him
to come hang out with us again.

13:40.150 --> 13:42.369
Nobody's seen him lately.

13:43.820 --> 13:45.117
[panting]

13:46.190 --> 13:50.058
Offensive conduct doesn't
even have to be sexual.

13:50.090 --> 13:51.182
Language,

13:51.230 --> 13:54.359
singling out somebody
based on gender.

13:57.170 --> 13:58.797
Even staring,

13:58.830 --> 14:02.061
if it's combined
with threatening behavior.

14:02.100 --> 14:04.330
N-Now, that all being said,

14:04.370 --> 14:09.001
we know that coworkers
are gonna have sexual relations.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.646
I'm sure that some of you
already have.

14:11.680 --> 14:14.012
But, most harassment
cases happen

14:14.050 --> 14:16.473
when there's an unequal
power dynamic.

14:16.520 --> 14:19.683
Like between, say, a doctor
and an orderly.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.381
...to make sure that it's put
to a stop

14:21.420 --> 14:23.559
before things get
out of control.

14:23.590 --> 14:25.058
Man speaks the truth.

14:25.090 --> 14:26.387
I get it.

14:30.270 --> 14:32.932
[whispering]
Everyone is looking at you.

14:32.970 --> 14:34.369
It's the story of my life.

14:34.400 --> 14:37.563
Try getting left at the altar.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.567
[speaker] I have a little rule when
it comes to sexual harassment,

14:39.610 --> 14:40.702
especially if you've
been warned.

14:40.740 --> 14:44.404
And that is, when in doubt,
cut it out.

14:44.450 --> 14:45.906
[light laughter]

14:45.950 --> 14:47.873
If you have any questions,

14:47.920 --> 14:51.686
you can always come to me, to my
office for a private one-on-one.

14:51.720 --> 14:54.712
- That's not at all creepy.
- [laughing]

14:56.020 --> 14:59.957
I guess we'll just, uh, wait
'til our coworkers are finished.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.298
- [clearing throat]
- Oh, good, they've finished.

15:02.330 --> 15:04.594
[chuckles]
Now, what exactly

15:04.630 --> 15:07.497
is harassment?

there was a party.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.225
Well, yeah, there is now
that you're here, come on.

15:31.260 --> 15:33.092
Okay, you're cute,
but not that cute.

15:33.130 --> 15:35.656
- Oh...
- Yeah, I'm saving threesomes for marriage.

15:35.700 --> 15:38.294
Sorry!
- That's not what I mean. No, no, actually...

15:38.330 --> 15:39.764
you're coming inside

15:39.800 --> 15:43.430
because you can't wait
to give my friend, Henry,

15:43.470 --> 15:45.939
whatever he needs.

15:48.910 --> 15:50.571
Why are we wasting
time out here?

15:50.610 --> 15:52.408
- [laughing]
- Yeah!

15:52.450 --> 15:55.420
- Henry needs us!
- Let's go.

16:02.160 --> 16:03.855
Before you meet Henry,

16:03.890 --> 16:06.484
there's one little thing
I forgot to tell you.

16:06.530 --> 16:08.294
Why is there always a catch?

16:08.330 --> 16:10.970
No, this is very, very good.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.732
Henry is the most handsome man
that you've ever seen.

16:19.410 --> 16:22.471
"And everyday, I, a curious boy,
never too close,

16:22.510 --> 16:23.944

You don't like Walt Whitman?

16:31.550 --> 16:33.018
Hmm...

16:33.060 --> 16:36.712
No, I liked him just fine.

16:40.130 --> 16:41.950

Your wounds are healing
on their own.

- I've got to show a doctor!
- No.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.390
Mm-mm.

16:50.740 --> 16:52.765
But it's a miracle.

16:54.780 --> 16:56.999
How did you survive out there?

16:57.050 --> 17:00.372
- I killed them before they killed me.
- [scoffs]

17:00.420 --> 17:02.741
You joke about it,

17:02.780 --> 17:05.579
but I could never
do what you did.

17:05.619 --> 17:08.589
I wish I had a tenth
of what you have.

17:14.730 --> 17:17.369

You seem a good man, Henry.

17:19.630 --> 17:23.031
Be thankful that you don't know.

17:23.069 --> 17:25.539
How many have you killed?

17:25.569 --> 17:27.709
I lost count

go there tonight and ask.

I loved her first.

25:57.820 --> 26:00.039
But you never even
asked her out.

26:00.090 --> 26:02.752
That's because I over-think
things and then

26:02.790 --> 26:05.953

It's kind of my move, and

26:05.990 --> 26:07.526

26:07.560 --> 26:10.393
But you were the one
who told me to ask her out.

26:10.430 --> 26:12.023
Yeah, but in all fairness,

to you, too.

No offense.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.035

it was the first time

26:38.030 --> 26:40.158
that I had her to myself.

26:40.190 --> 26:41.897
So, what?
This is, like, your thing, then?

26:41.930 --> 26:44.319
You just go around possessing
guys SO you can have sex with her?

26:44.370 --> 26:45.724
- No, man!
- No? No?

26:45.770 --> 26:48.762
No, it's so much lamer.
I-I-1...

26:50.370 --> 26:54.329

the way she used to look at you.

That's what I thought,
too, until last night.

27:18.700 --> 27:22.000
Josh, listen to me.
I have watched her for so long,

27:22.040 --> 27:25.499
and when I saw the way
that she looked at you,

27:25.540 --> 27:28.009
I knew this could be
my last chance,

27:28.040 --> 27:30.304
and you, you were just
gonna let it go.

27:30.340 --> 27:33.503

what I could do to her.

No...

you lose it.

But, you're still alive.

27:55.740 --> 27:57.959
And if you wanted,
if you wanted,

27:58.010 --> 28:02.174
you could have Julia
look at you like that

28:02.210 --> 28:05.578
for the rest of your life.

28:05.610 --> 28:09.171
I would trade my curse

28:09.220 --> 28:12.246
for yours any day.
- No.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.853
You say you love her,
but look what you did.

28:17.890 --> 28:19.688
Now, I...

28:19.730 --> 28:21.721
I either bring her in closer,

28:21.760 --> 28:25.526
or I break her heart.

us in, or you get out of here.

38:40.480 --> 38:41.641
- It's okay.
- You need to get out!

38:41.680 --> 38:43.819
It's okay.
We're gonna get you help.

38:43.850 --> 38:45.716
And then, you are never
gonna do this again.

38:45.750 --> 38:47.445
I didn't do anything!

38:47.490 --> 38:49.151
I didn't do anything!
It was him!

38:49.190 --> 38:51.056
Sally!

38:51.090 --> 38:54.025
There is no Reaper.

38:54.060 --> 38:57.052
<i>*Xk</i>

38:59.870 --> 39:02.362
I know I screwed up,
but I never brought it here.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.663
He didn't have anyplace to go.

39:03.700 --> 39:05.737
You know how many places I've
got where there's no pretense?

39:05.770 --> 39:08.137
Where just being
isn't exhausting?

39:08.170 --> 39:10.935
One.
This house, with you and Sally.

39:10.980 --> 39:12.869
I've almost earned
my freedom once and for all,

39:12.910 --> 39:14.309
but I told you
that it was gonna get messy.

39:14.350 --> 39:15.340
No, no, no, no.

39:15.380 --> 39:16.916
There's messy,
and then there's this.

39:16.950 --> 39:18.349
This is never going
to happen again.

39:18.390 --> 39:19.915
We're gonna get it back
to the way it was.

39:19.950 --> 39:21.042
Don't worry about it.

39:21.090 --> 39:24.981
- He's right behind you.
- No, there is nobody else here.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.327
- He's right behind...
- It's gonna be all right.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.419
- [screaming]
- Let go of him!

39:28.460 --> 39:30.098
He didn't do anything!

39:30.130 --> 39:33.521
He thinks he can have a human,
flaunt it in our face?

39:33.570 --> 39:34.731
Please, don't do this.

39:34.770 --> 39:36.465
Stop it!
Stop!

39:36.500 --> 39:39.470
I'm not gonna do this.
I'm never gonna be like you.

39:39.510 --> 39:40.932
[chuckling]

39:40.970 --> 39:44.076
Don't you get it, Sally?

39:44.110 --> 39:46.101
You are me.

39:46.850 --> 39:48.340
Here's how it goes.

39:48.380 --> 39:50.269
Usually, a ghost is around

39:50.320 --> 39:53.017
just long enough
to have a little fun.

39:53.050 --> 39:56.054
But the longer a ghost circles
the drain, crazier the ghost.

39:56.090 --> 39:58.525
What do you want?!

39:58.560 --> 39:59.721
[screaming]

39:59.760 --> 40:01.421
- I'm unbalanced?
- Yes!

40:01.460 --> 40:04.100
You're the one who passed up
your door, and you possess!

40:04.130 --> 40:06.861
I don't need your help!
You're crazy!

40:06.900 --> 40:09.790
[grunting]

40:09.840 --> 40:10.762
Who are you?

40:10.800 --> 40:12.609
[distorted]
You know exactly who I am.

40:12.640 --> 40:15.735
Sally!
There is no Reaper.

40:17.480 --> 40:20.472
[grunting]

40:20.510 --> 40:23.047
You are an interesting case,
Sally Malik.

40:23.080 --> 40:25.788
- What do you mean?
- You're...

40:25.820 --> 40:27.117
special.

40:27.150 --> 40:30.085
You really think so?

40:34.030 --> 40:35.259
Sally.

40:36.360 --> 40:37.896
Sally!

40:37.930 --> 40:40.069
Sally, Sally.
Let him go.

40:40.100 --> 40:41.420
You don't wanna do this, Sally.

40:41.470 --> 40:43.438
I think I do.

40:43.470 --> 40:45.234
Oh, and, boys,

40:45.270 --> 40:48.501
Sally isn't here anymore.

40:48.540 --> 40:50.030
[screaming]

40:54.850 --> 40:56.648
What did you do?

40:56.680 --> 40:59.012
He had to go.

40:59.050 --> 41:00.211
They all did.

41:00.250 --> 41:02.082
You don't get to decide that.

41:02.120 --> 41:04.179
Somebody has to.

41:04.220 --> 41:08.498
Somebody has to tell them that
they don't belong here anymore,

41:08.530 --> 41:10.999
that it's time
to stop holding on.

41:11.030 --> 41:13.829
Sally, you belong here with us.

41:13.870 --> 41:16.692
[deep voice]
Oh, that's so sweet.

41:16.740 --> 41:19.459
You sound just like Nick.

41:19.510 --> 41:22.502
Is that how you want
to be treated?

41:22.540 --> 41:25.475
[screaming]

41:32.790 --> 41:35.657
Aidan!
She's not kidding around, man!

41:37.060 --> 41:38.357

42:12.330 --> 42:13.479
[softly]
What's going on?

42:13.530 --> 42:16.522
We're not sure yet.

42:16.560 --> 42:18.562
Are-Are you, are you okay?

42:18.600 --> 42:21.570
I think...
[panting]

42:21.600 --> 42:24.968
I can't...

42:25.010 --> 42:27.536
Can you, um...
- Yeah.

42:27.570 --> 42:29.072
Of course.
- No, no.

42:29.110 --> 42:32.045
- What?
- Uh-uh, mm-mm.

42:32.080 --> 42:35.015
Guys, let me out.

42:35.050 --> 42:37.109
Guys, come on.

42:37.150 --> 42:39.710
[deep voice] I said let me
the hell out of here!
