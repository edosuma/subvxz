07:56.810 --> 07:58.844
Relax, Care Bear.
We probably just blew a fuse

07:58.846 --> 07:59.845
from overconsumption.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.246
But the main reason

08:01.248 --> 08:03.482
we made this our home
is because of the power,

08:03.484 --> 08:05.517
and if we don't get it back,

08:05.519 --> 08:08.620
I'm worried people are gonna

11:06.033 --> 11:08.800

11:08.802 --> 11:12.270

11:15.108 --> 11:16.808

11:16.810 --> 11:20.845
I had two amazing girlfriends
I was crazy about.

11:20.847 --> 11:22.881
Now, one dumped me,

11:22.883 --> 11:25.950
and the other one's
just not there anymore.

11:25.952 --> 11:28.453
Melissa's still having issues?

11:28.455 --> 11:30.789
It's like she's devoid
of human emotion.

11:30.791 --> 11:33.958
I... I just...
I just can't connect with her.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.293

11:40.166 --> 11:41.833
Carol, what happened?
Are you okay?

11:41.835 --> 11:45.637
I was just walking, and this
thingy fell from the ceiling.

11:45.639 --> 11:48.339
It scared the
Beetlejuice out of me.

11:48.341 --> 11:50.475
And nobody say
that again twice.

11:50.477 --> 11:53.712
Beetlejuice?
Tandy, we have
enough problems here

11:53.714 --> 11:55.046
without introducing
a troublemaker

11:55.048 --> 11:56.414
from the spirit world.

11:56.416 --> 11:57.716
Fine, nobody say
"Beetlejuice" again.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.050
(whispers):
Tandy!

11:59.052 --> 12:00.985
So, on top of
the unreliable power,

12:00.987 --> 12:03.822
the ugly art displays could
skull-crush us at any moment.

12:03.824 --> 12:06.925
Maybe this place isn't
the paradise we thought it was.

12:06.927 --> 12:08.660
I think we're all overreacting.

12:08.662 --> 12:10.361
This was just an accident.
CAROL: Yeah.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.831
There's always a few hiccups
moving into a new home.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.532
I'm sure we won't get killed.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.568
Okay, we should get you
in the other room. Come on.
Yeah.

12:16.570 --> 12:18.036
Yeah, let's get you
to a massage chair, Carol.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.304
Ugh.
Come on.

12:38.224 --> 12:40.291

12:59.412 --> 13:01.312
These are pretty
great, huh?

13:01.314 --> 13:03.281
Good for all
kinds of things.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.283
Why did you put wire cutters
in my coffee?

13:05.285 --> 13:08.820
Oh, so you know
what they're called.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.522
Interesting.

13:14.260 --> 13:15.727
(whispering):
So, you cut the power,

13:15.729 --> 13:17.428
drop a sculpture on my wife,

13:17.430 --> 13:20.398
make the house look bad
so we all want to move.

13:20.400 --> 13:24.235
Great plan, except I'm onto you.

13:24.237 --> 13:26.304
What are you up to next?

13:28.073 --> 13:30.308
(gunshot)

13:31.277 --> 13:33.278
Hey.

13:33.280 --> 13:34.979
Shooting some chairs, huh?

13:34.981 --> 13:36.714
Yup.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.253
Nice shot.

13:42.255 --> 13:44.856
Gail and I broke up.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.591
I-I just wanted you to know.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.159
Okay.

13:50.095 --> 13:51.796
(shotgun racks)
On the bright side,

13:51.798 --> 13:54.465
I'll get to spend more time
with you now, though.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.100
Okay.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.938
Okay.

13:59.940 --> 14:02.707
Well... good talk.

14:02.709 --> 14:04.209
Bye.

14:05.177 --> 14:06.978
Todd?

14:06.980 --> 14:09.280
Yeah.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.524
(whispers):
Oh.

14:19.526 --> 14:22.026
I'm sorry you're sad.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.198
I don't know what I'd do
if I ever lost you.

14:27.200 --> 14:31.002
You're the only thing that
matters to me in this world,

14:31.004 --> 14:33.404
and I'm here for you.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.809
What's wrong?

14:37.811 --> 14:40.245
(voice breaking):
Just good to have you back.

14:51.423 --> 14:53.224
Got you!

14:53.226 --> 14:54.492
What the hell, Tandy?!

14:54.494 --> 14:56.561
What are you doing in here?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.196
I'm going to the bathroom.

14:58.198 --> 15:00.565
Really?

15:00.567 --> 15:01.900
Can I see it?

15:01.902 --> 15:04.168
No, you cannot see it.

15:04.170 --> 15:06.838
Has something died in there?

15:06.840 --> 15:08.072
No, Tandy.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.440
(chuckles)

15:09.442 --> 15:11.209
Just funny.

15:11.211 --> 15:13.011
Most people take care
of their restroom stuff

15:13.013 --> 15:14.545
before they go to bed.

15:14.547 --> 15:16.347
Or if they got to go
in the middle of the night

15:16.349 --> 15:19.851
and the restroom's far away,
they just do their business,

15:19.853 --> 15:22.453
number one or number two,
in a cup by the bed

15:22.455 --> 15:24.355
and deal with the cup
in the morning.

15:24.357 --> 15:26.958
Well, then you and I have
very different processes.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.559
Now, what is it you want?

15:28.561 --> 15:31.963
For you to know that I'm...

15:31.965 --> 15:33.831
(whispers):
watching you.

15:36.068 --> 15:38.102
Get out of here.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.425

16:00.427 --> 16:02.260
You know, I finally had
a breakthrough with Melissa.

16:02.262 --> 16:04.062
You know, it seems like
she turned a corner.

16:04.064 --> 16:05.763
Oh, that's great.
Congratulations.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.632
Thanks, bud.
Hey, um, listen.

16:07.634 --> 16:09.567
I forgot my soap.
Can I borrow yours?

16:09.569 --> 16:11.235
Oh, sure.
Hang on one sec.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.083
Here you go.

16:25.085 --> 16:26.818
Ah. Thanks, buddy.
Gonna need that back.

16:26.820 --> 16:28.653
You got it.

16:33.025 --> 16:34.692
What the hell?

16:36.662 --> 16:39.163
No, no, no, I knew it!

16:51.443 --> 16:53.878
I knew it. I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it!

16:53.880 --> 16:54.946
Lewis.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.017
You!

16:59.019 --> 17:00.551
What?

17:00.553 --> 17:02.687
Just tell me
why you're doing it.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.122
Why I'm doing what, Tandy?

17:04.124 --> 17:06.991
Trying to ruin
this building, Lewis.

17:06.993 --> 17:09.627
Why in the hell
would I even do that?

17:09.629 --> 17:12.230
Oh, it's eating you up that we
moved into an office building,

17:12.232 --> 17:14.232
so now you want us
all to hate it

17:14.234 --> 17:16.501
so we can move
to wherever<i> you</i> choose.

17:16.503 --> 17:19.037
Well, I have good news
for you, man.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.406
You can go wherever the hell
you want to now,

17:21.408 --> 17:23.808
'cause you are no longer
welcome here.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.810
Come on, get out of here! Go!

17:25.812 --> 17:27.311
Follow your book.

17:27.313 --> 17:29.180
Tandy, what
are you doing?

17:29.182 --> 17:31.549
Taking out the trash, Care Bear.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.418
See, thanks
to Lewis here,

17:33.420 --> 17:37.588
the toilets may be broken,
but we still got one last flush.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.258
And it's you from this building.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.060
This is insane!

17:42.062 --> 17:43.261
Is it?
Tandy, you can't do this.

17:43.263 --> 17:44.929
Yes, I can,
and I have to, Carol.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.097
But he didn't
do anything.

17:46.099 --> 17:47.432
TANDY:
No.

17:47.434 --> 17:48.699
Somebody is behind this!

17:48.701 --> 17:50.101
It's not me!

17:50.103 --> 17:53.171
Well, if you didn't do it,
then who the hell did?

17:53.173 --> 17:54.939
I did!

18:00.679 --> 18:02.880
Lewis, could you, uh, excuse
me for a moment, please?

18:02.882 --> 18:04.582
Yeah, sure.
Thank you.

18:15.527 --> 18:17.595
Why'd you... why'd you do it?

18:21.266 --> 18:23.134
(sighs)

18:23.136 --> 18:27.105
I just always had this dream
of where I'd raise my family.

18:27.107 --> 18:31.242
A small house, tiny yard,
white picket fence.

18:31.244 --> 18:33.878
And I didn't want
that dream to die.

18:33.880 --> 18:36.447
See, all I ever wanted
was a home

18:36.449 --> 18:39.550
that was already
a home to call home.

18:39.552 --> 18:41.953
Like a house.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.055
You should've told me.

18:44.057 --> 18:46.491
I tried, but you were
so excited about it,

18:46.493 --> 18:50.495
your face lit up like you were
watching the world's best porn.

18:50.497 --> 18:53.131
Like if supermodels did porn.

18:53.133 --> 18:56.200
Hey... you're my
supermodel porn.

19:04.009 --> 19:06.511
Look, I don't want to stay
if you don't want to be here.

19:06.513 --> 19:07.512
No.

19:07.514 --> 19:10.848
Wherever you are
is the perfect home.

19:12.918 --> 19:15.486
I should probably go
tell the others.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.955
And then I said, "I tried, but
you were so excited about it,

19:17.957 --> 19:20.925
"your face lit up like you were
watching the world's best porn.

19:20.927 --> 19:22.827
Like if supermodels did porn."

19:22.829 --> 19:26.531
And then I said, "Carol,
you're my supermodel porn."

19:26.533 --> 19:27.632
And then we kissed.

19:27.634 --> 19:28.633
(chuckles)

19:28.635 --> 19:30.668
Aw.

19:33.872 --> 19:35.740
Okay, we got it.
(groans)

19:36.942 --> 19:38.876
Just can't believe
you did this, Carol.

19:38.878 --> 19:40.811
It's very unlike you.

19:40.813 --> 19:44.048
On the other hand, nobody
got hurt, so... (chuckles)

19:44.050 --> 19:46.284
Yeah, it's all right, Carol.
All is forgiven.

19:46.286 --> 19:50.121
Oh, no, this is a society,
and we have rules.

19:50.123 --> 19:52.990
I deserve punishment.

19:52.992 --> 19:54.926
Throw a book at me.

19:58.363 --> 20:01.465
TANDY:
All right.

20:01.467 --> 20:05.002
CAROL: Tandy, this is violating
my parole.

20:05.004 --> 20:07.138
Just taking you on
a little furlough.

20:07.140 --> 20:09.307
Okay, you ready?

20:09.309 --> 20:11.375
Surprise!

20:14.746 --> 20:15.846
(Tandy chuckles)

20:15.848 --> 20:17.815
Oh, my goodness.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.917
I don't know how close
it is to your dreams,

20:19.919 --> 20:22.486
but I promise we'll
make it feel like a home.

20:22.488 --> 20:24.889
CAROL:
It's perfect.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.023
I love it.

20:26.025 --> 20:27.692
And I love you.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.927
I love you, too.

20:29.929 --> 20:32.096
(moans)

20:32.098 --> 20:34.832
Melissa?

20:34.834 --> 20:36.200
MELISSA:
Hey, Todd.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.436
Hey, Melissa, I was just...

20:40.072 --> 20:41.772
You, uh...

20:41.774 --> 20:43.341
You're not doing shirts today?

20:43.343 --> 20:44.842
Nope, I can't.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.044
Okay, and why-why's that?

20:47.046 --> 20:49.013
I burned them all.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.584
Why?

20:53.586 --> 20:55.753
I don't know.

20:55.755 --> 20:59.857
Hey, so I have some
really exciting news.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.892
Oh, yeah? What... what's that?

21:01.894 --> 21:04.862
Well, I know we talked about it
a long time ago,

21:04.864 --> 21:08.933
but I decided I'm finally ready.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.535
You're... ready?

21:11.537 --> 21:13.437
For... what?

21:13.439 --> 21:14.872
(chuckles)

21:14.874 --> 21:17.208
Ready to have a baby with you!

21:19.211 --> 21:20.211
(softly):
Yeah.
