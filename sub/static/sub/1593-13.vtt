( crickets chirping )

00:35.328 --> 00:38.491
(birds chirping)

00:38.664 --> 00:41.406
No, no, it's cool.
I'm usually up.

00:41.584 --> 00:43.120
| used to open
for a coffee shop

00:43.294 --> 00:45.956
every day for seven years.

00:46.130 --> 00:50.840
Your brain, it gets wired
to things you don't need anymore.

00:51.010 --> 00:54.548
I still like carrying around
my cell phone, too.

00:54.722 --> 00:58.340
One of these days it's gonna ring
and freak my ass out.

00:58.517 --> 01:01.725
Hey, if you happen to bag a boar
out there, can I have a leg?

01:03.231 --> 01:04.892
To make a prosciutto.

01:05.066 --> 01:08.524
| used to cure meats in my basement
even before all this.

01:08.694 --> 01:10.810
I made some
kick-ass pickles, too.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.569
Sure, Olivia.

01:18.204 --> 01:19.865
Thanks.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.341
( glass shatters )

02:02.206 --> 02:03.821
( glass shatters )

02:19.640 --> 02:21.096

echoing )

- ( snarling stops)
-( heart beating )

02:53.966 --> 02:55.922
(sighs)

03:02.933 --> 03:04.798
Come and get me.

03:08.022 --> 03:10.934
(theme music playing )

03:46.018 --> 03:48.430
-( leaves rustling )
- ( crow cawing )

03:48.604 --> 03:50.686
(walker snarling )

03:54.360 --> 03:57.318
I don't see it, but it's close.

03:57.488 --> 03:59.945
There's just one of 'em.

04:00.116 --> 04:01.902
We won't be here long.

04:02.076 --> 04:04.488
- So what do you think?
- We can go in when it's empty.

04:04.662 --> 04:06.698
Well, how is that?
It's locked up at night.

04:06.872 --> 04:07.952
The window.
There's just a latch.

04:08.124 --> 04:09.364
I can leave it open.

04:10.876 --> 04:12.662
- A latch?
- Yeah.

04:12.837 --> 04:14.543
What if one of those pricks
shuts it?

04:14.713 --> 04:17.455
Wait a couple of days,
leave it open again.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.464
- ( walker snarling )
- It's getting closer.

04:19.635 --> 04:21.466
We need to do it
sooner than later.

04:21.637 --> 04:22.843
Right now,
they're not watching us.

04:23.013 --> 04:25.720
Not worrying about
meetings like this.

04:25.891 --> 04:27.973
We may need the guns,
we may not.

04:28.144 --> 04:30.055
We will
whatever way it goes.

04:30.229 --> 04:33.266
They're the luckiest
damn people I ever met.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.977
And they just keep
getting luckier.

04:35.151 --> 04:36.391
How's that?

04:36.569 --> 04:38.480
We're here now.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.235
They've got a couple
of footlockers

04:43.409 --> 04:46.367
just full of 9 millimeter autos,
Rugers, Kel-Tecs.

04:46.537 --> 04:48.778
Just tossed in there.
They don't use them.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.696
They're never gonna know
they're gone.

04:50.875 --> 04:53.082
Someone's got one now, right?

04:54.336 --> 04:55.997
Mmm.

04:56.172 --> 05:00.040
Listen, the others,
we want them to try.

05:00.217 --> 05:01.593
You, too.

05:02.803 --> 05:05.340
So we keep it quiet.
Just us.

05:05.514 --> 05:07.596
- ( walker snarling )
- Here it comes.

05:22.114 --> 05:23.570
We said we were
taking me out shooting.

05:23.741 --> 05:26.027
I couldn't go back
with a full mag.

05:26.202 --> 05:27.942
Lucky he came by.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.951
We should get back.

05:31.415 --> 05:34.407
You'll pull the latch,
we'll pick our moment.

05:34.585 --> 05:37.167
Us, we don't need
to be lucky.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.333
What the hell's that?

05:41.717 --> 05:43.833
Is that a W?

05:44.011 --> 05:45.797
Carol:
Yeah.

06:03.447 --> 06:05.483
(sighs)

06:21.840 --> 06:23.831
(sighs)

06:28.639 --> 06:31.506
I don't know if this
is some kind of play,

06:31.684 --> 06:34.221
handing authority
to strangers.

06:34.395 --> 06:36.932
The authority
to break up fistfights.

06:37.106 --> 06:40.314
Well, if it was just that, she should
have given one of these to Daryl.

06:41.610 --> 06:45.398
I don't know if it's for us
or for them.

06:45.573 --> 06:49.316
Or maybe Deanna's trying
to get rid of us and them.

06:49.493 --> 06:52.235
You put these jackets
on me and you,

06:52.413 --> 06:54.904
have the people see it.

06:55.082 --> 06:57.539
If that's the play,
that'd be smart.

06:59.420 --> 07:01.206
And she seems smart.

07:02.756 --> 07:05.247
Smart for then
or smart for now?

07:06.760 --> 07:09.046
This is now.

07:21.609 --> 07:23.145
( leaves rustling )

07:23.319 --> 07:24.934
Come out!

07:25.112 --> 07:27.068
Now!

07:39.376 --> 07:42.083
You can tell the difference between
walkers and humans by sound?

07:48.302 --> 07:50.964
Can you tell the difference between
a good guy and a bad guy?

07:52.598 --> 07:54.429
Rick doesn't seem
to be an expert at that.

07:54.600 --> 07:55.931
There ain't much
of a difference no more.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.682
That how you feel
about your people?

07:57.853 --> 08:00.094
Why you following me?

08:01.106 --> 08:02.642
I didn't know I was.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.852
I came out to hunt rabbits.

08:07.446 --> 08:09.437
I know why you're out here.

08:11.784 --> 08:13.320
Mind ifljoin?

08:17.956 --> 08:19.696
Keep up.

08:19.875 --> 08:21.911
And keep quiet.

08:25.214 --> 08:27.296
Deanna:
You protect and serve.

08:27.466 --> 08:30.378
You patrol, walk the wall,
watch out for the kids.

08:30.552 --> 08:33.464
If there's a conflict,
you solve it.

08:33.639 --> 08:36.005
And people will listen to you.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.684
Because we're wearing
windbreakers?

08:37.851 --> 08:40.228
Because they believe in this.

08:40.396 --> 08:42.682
Because I'm telling them to.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.523
A police officer used to live here.

08:46.694 --> 08:50.232
So we had these jackets
and I wanted to make it official.

08:50.406 --> 08:51.987
So it's official.

08:52.157 --> 08:54.819
There's gonna be
a government here one day.

08:54.993 --> 08:58.326
That's why I want
Maggie working with me.

08:58.497 --> 09:01.739
There's gonna be a police force.
That's why I want you two to start it.

09:01.917 --> 09:06.661
| see a vibrant community here
with industry,

09:06.839 --> 09:10.206
commerce, civilization.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.421
Real lives.

09:13.595 --> 09:17.008
It might be horses
and mills, but-- what?

09:17.182 --> 09:19.844
Does that sound like
pie in the sky?

09:20.018 --> 09:21.849
No.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.012
No.

09:27.192 --> 09:29.524
No.

09:29.695 --> 09:31.526
Can we talk security?

09:31.697 --> 09:34.689
We need a constant patrol
along the walls.

09:34.867 --> 09:37.279
Notjust looking for damage,

09:37.453 --> 09:39.535
but signs that anyone
climbed in from outside.

09:41.999 --> 09:44.911
You can move
right up the supports.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.326
That's what I'd do.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.210
People are the real threat now.

09:49.381 --> 09:52.464
Rick, I know you think that we should
all be armed within the walls.

09:52.634 --> 09:55.626
|-- I can't do that.

09:57.306 --> 09:58.967
That's fine.

09:59.141 --> 10:01.883
You make these changes,
we won't need to.

10:02.060 --> 10:04.392
Sasha:
Excuse me.

10:08.400 --> 10:11.107
I want to volunteer to be
one of the lookouts in the clock tower.

10:11.278 --> 10:12.893
There are no lookouts
in the clock tower.

10:13.071 --> 10:15.357
- What?
- We saw someone up there earlier.

10:15.532 --> 10:19.275
That was an empty rifle
my son Spencer put up there.

10:19.453 --> 10:22.286
He mans it sometimes,
but not often.

10:22.456 --> 10:25.243
Look, there hasn't
been the need.

10:25.417 --> 10:29.581
We need a lookout in that tower
right now, 24/7.

10:29.755 --> 10:31.746
It's the only way we'll be able to see
if someone's coming at us.

10:31.924 --> 10:33.255
Okay, okay, we'll make shifts.

10:33.425 --> 10:36.417
I'll take those shifts,
as many as possible.

10:38.013 --> 10:39.219
Why?

10:40.682 --> 10:42.547
Sasha's one of our best shots.

10:42.726 --> 10:43.932
She can do it.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.978
I'm gonna put Spencer
up there today.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.765
l'll consider you being
our primary lookout,

10:51.944 --> 10:53.935
but I want something
in return.

10:55.614 --> 10:59.152
Tonight I'm hosting a welcome

10:59.326 --> 11:02.739
for all of you at my home.

11:02.913 --> 11:04.995
I want you to be there.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.621
Why?

11:06.792 --> 11:10.376
Come tonight.
Then we'll talk about it.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.798
Mashed lima beans, cocoa powder,
a little sweetener.

11:16.969 --> 11:19.836
lwould have eaten it
before all this, I swear.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.514
lt's protein and it fills you up.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.889
Sounds delicious.

11:25.477 --> 11:26.466
I'll be back.

11:26.645 --> 11:28.806
I've got to go beg Rick
for some help with tonight.

11:28.981 --> 11:30.642
You need anything else,
you hit me, girl.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.681
Okay, thanks.

11:36.530 --> 11:38.270
You've heard about the party?

11:38.448 --> 11:39.858
Everyone's gonna be there.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.240
That's right.

11:42.411 --> 11:44.402
So tonight, then.

11:44.580 --> 11:47.413
Should be able to slip out.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.289
The armory
is right next to Deanna's.

11:49.459 --> 11:51.290
l'll back you up.

11:51.461 --> 11:53.622
People might wonder
where their new constable is

11:53.797 --> 11:55.788
or Carl's dad.

11:55.966 --> 11:57.502
Okay.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.462
We can't use Daryl.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.843
They're watching
every move he makes.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.470
It's fine.

12:03.640 --> 12:06.052
You know what's great
about this place?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.342
| get to be invisible again.

12:19.698 --> 12:21.654
( horse nickers)

12:30.042 --> 12:32.033
( nickers )

12:33.378 --> 12:35.369
I've been trying
to catch him for months,

12:35.547 --> 12:36.957
bring him inside.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.623
His name is Buttons.

12:41.887 --> 12:44.720
One of the kids saw him
run by the gate a while back.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.346
Thought he looked
like a Buttons.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.100
I haven't seen him for a while.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.556
l was afraid it was too late.

12:56.360 --> 12:59.477
Every time Eric or I come close,
he gets spooked.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.526
Have you done this before?

13:03.700 --> 13:05.406
My group did.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.784
But they weren't
out there that long.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.071
The longer they're out there,

13:10.248 --> 13:12.739
the more they become
what they really are.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.587
I ain't gonna hurt ya.

13:26.765 --> 13:28.676
All right?

13:28.850 --> 13:30.636
Come on, boy.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.551
Yeah.

13:32.729 --> 13:34.936
Just keep on eating.

13:35.107 --> 13:36.847
Yeah.
(clicks tongue)

13:37.025 --> 13:38.856
Good boy.

13:39.027 --> 13:41.860
Yeah, you used to be
somebody's, huh?

13:43.281 --> 13:45.272
- Now you're just yours.
- ( twig snaps )

13:45.450 --> 13:46.781
- ( nickers )
- ( walkers snarling )

13:46.952 --> 13:47.941
Shit!

13:50.580 --> 13:52.787
( neighs )

13:55.168 --> 13:57.625
- Come on, they're coming!
- ( silenced gunshot)

14:10.767 --> 14:12.052
Come on.

14:13.854 --> 14:16.516
You really substitute
applesauce for eggs?

14:16.690 --> 14:18.521
That could change my life.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.228
If we can keep that
between you and me.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.267
It's sort of the secret
to these cookies.

14:22.446 --> 14:25.153
- Are you serious?
- I am.

14:25.323 --> 14:27.109
A girl's got
only so many secrets.

14:27.284 --> 14:28.865
It'll die with me.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.618
Uh, the chocolate
is kind of a trick.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.073
You actually have it?

14:33.248 --> 14:34.954
I can only ration you
a quarter bar.

14:35.125 --> 14:36.990
I'll make it work.

14:37.169 --> 14:39.205
Hey, Olivia.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.664
We're gonna need to make
a withdrawal.

14:40.839 --> 14:41.828
Late start?

14:42.007 --> 14:45.124
Boss lady wants me to check that strut
on the east wall before the party.

14:45.302 --> 14:47.133
Head on back.

14:47.304 --> 14:49.215
Carol, just grab
what you need.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.926
- Chocolate's in the hall freezer.
- Okay.

15:08.742 --> 15:10.903
You afraid of guns, ma'am?

15:11.078 --> 15:13.285
Mm, no, I...

15:13.455 --> 15:16.037
well, I had a handgun
and I carried a rifle

15:16.208 --> 15:19.416
when we were on the outside,
but I'm not an expert.

15:20.629 --> 15:22.915
Not with those, at least.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.668
Well, my name is Tobin.

15:26.843 --> 15:30.802
And whenever you want,
I'd be happy to teach you.

15:30.972 --> 15:34.681
It's better to be safe than sorry.

15:34.851 --> 15:37.012
That'd be nice.
Thanks, Tobin.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.553
- Thank you, Olivia.
- Mm-hmm.

15:50.075 --> 15:51.360
You ride horses?

15:51.535 --> 15:53.446
I ride bikes.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.784
I take it you don't mean
10-speeds.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.164
I know you're feeling
like an outsider.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.131
It's not your fault, you know.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.417
Eric and l,

16:10.595 --> 16:13.587
we're still looked at as outsiders
in a lot of ways.

16:15.809 --> 16:18.721
We've heard our fair share
of well-meaning,

16:18.895 --> 16:21.762
but hilariously
offensive things

16:21.940 --> 16:24.431
from some otherwise
really nice men and women.

16:26.611 --> 16:28.863
People are people.

16:29.030 --> 16:31.692
The more afraid they get,
the more stupid they get.

16:33.326 --> 16:35.612
Fear shrinks the brain.

16:38.206 --> 16:41.289
They're scared of you and me
for different reasons.

16:42.961 --> 16:45.373
They're less scared of me
because they know me.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.293
It's less and less every day.

16:51.052 --> 16:54.544
So let them get to know you.

16:55.974 --> 16:58.306
You should go
to Deanna's party tonight.

16:58.476 --> 17:00.728
I got nothing to prove.

17:03.023 --> 17:07.892
I met a lot of bad people out here
doing a lot of bad shit.

17:08.069 --> 17:10.025
They weren't afraid of nothing.

17:11.573 --> 17:14.155
Yeah, they were.

17:14.326 --> 17:17.238
- ( music playing)
-( people chatting, laughing )

17:24.169 --> 17:26.535
Oh, my.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.214
Welcome.

17:28.381 --> 17:29.712
Hi.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.373
Oh, it's so good to see you.

17:31.551 --> 17:34.668
Hi, Carl.
Thank you for coming.

17:34.846 --> 17:38.384
You know, I didn't get a chance
to interview this one.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.423
- I envy her.
- Rick: Why?

17:40.602 --> 17:43.014
She'll get to see
what this place will become.

17:43.188 --> 17:45.474
Come.
Come on in.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.874
I don't know about this.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.045
They have beer.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.424
I'm gonna try.

18:24.604 --> 18:26.219
You're Rick.

18:26.398 --> 18:28.889
Rick, this is my husband Reg.

18:29.067 --> 18:31.399
You're a pretty remarkable guy.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.150
Well, how's that?

18:33.321 --> 18:36.233
I watched the tapes,
all of them.

18:36.408 --> 18:38.194
The things those people
said about you.

18:38.368 --> 18:39.733
The things you did for them.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.528
Didn't you build
that wall out there?

18:43.707 --> 18:45.868
( chuckles )
Yeah, I did, with help.

18:46.042 --> 18:47.202
A lot of it.

18:47.377 --> 18:50.244
And it's a damned incredible
achievement.

18:50.422 --> 18:53.084
But it's a wall.

18:53.258 --> 18:55.249
( Deanna chuckles )

18:55.427 --> 18:59.591
14 lives in this world?

18:59.764 --> 19:01.220
I think you have me beat.

19:01.391 --> 19:04.258
Well, we're standing
behind that wall right now, dear.

19:04.436 --> 19:06.142
So let's call it a tie.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.053
( chuckles )

19:08.231 --> 19:10.597
Well, I'm glad you're here.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.766
Now, take a glass.

19:12.944 --> 19:15.060
I'm good.

19:15.238 --> 19:17.149
You don't have to be.

19:21.703 --> 19:24.240
( laughs)
There you go.

19:24.414 --> 19:26.200
Go on.

19:28.877 --> 19:30.959
Right. Welcome.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.290
- Thank you.
- ( door opens)

19:42.724 --> 19:45.682
(walkers snarling )

19:49.397 --> 19:52.013
Gotta move quick.
He's pinned in with them.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.814
I got the far ones.

20:02.994 --> 20:04.985
- ( snarling)
- ( groans)

20:17.175 --> 20:18.665
Thanks.

20:25.850 --> 20:27.386
Thanks.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.349
(whinnies)

20:32.524 --> 20:36.062
- ( walkers snarling )
- ( whinnying)

20:52.627 --> 20:54.538
I got the ones on the right.

21:08.226 --> 21:10.012
Go ahead.

21:11.312 --> 21:13.974
( horse breathing heavily )

21:30.748 --> 21:32.909
( sighs )
He always ran.

21:41.593 --> 21:43.549
You were trying to help him.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.641
- ( music playing)
-( people chatting )

22:00.612 --> 22:03.354
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:03.531 --> 22:06.273
Hey.
Are you okay?

22:06.451 --> 22:08.112
Yeah.

22:08.286 --> 22:11.949
Yeah, um, just isn't
really my thing.

22:14.792 --> 22:16.953
- I think I'm gonna head out.
- No, no.

22:17.128 --> 22:18.834
You're not bailing.

22:19.005 --> 22:21.041
We're in this together, man.

22:21.216 --> 22:22.956
Maggie:
You're here with us now.

22:24.052 --> 22:25.633
You're here with family.

22:28.932 --> 22:30.797
Come on.

22:48.326 --> 22:50.112
Daryl.

22:50.286 --> 22:52.026
Hey.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.366
Thought you were going
to that party over there.

22:54.541 --> 22:59.501
Oh, I was never going to go
'cause of Eric's ankle, thank God.

22:59.671 --> 23:01.662
Why the hell did you
tell me to go, then?

23:01.839 --> 23:04.581
I said try.
You did.

23:04.759 --> 23:07.296
It's a thought
that counts thing.

23:08.513 --> 23:11.050
- All right.
- Hey, come in.

23:11.224 --> 23:12.805
Have some dinner.

23:15.853 --> 23:17.059
Come on, man.

23:17.230 --> 23:19.972
It's some pretty serious
spaghetti.

23:20.149 --> 23:21.650
( door opens)

23:25.029 --> 23:29.648
Look, she's here,
which means it's empty, so...

23:29.826 --> 23:31.191
I'll go with you.

23:31.369 --> 23:33.451
No, remember...

23:33.621 --> 23:35.998
- You're invisible.
- Mm-hmm.

23:36.165 --> 23:39.293
Hey, Rick,
this is my husband Pete.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.667
Hey, good to meet you.

23:41.838 --> 23:44.375
I wanted to thank you
for taking on being our constable.

23:44.549 --> 23:46.710
If we keep growing at this rate,
we're gonna need even more.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.385
Well, I hope so.

23:48.553 --> 23:49.793
You want to come by my office
next week?

23:49.971 --> 23:51.757
I'll take a look at you.

23:52.765 --> 23:55.222
And I probably should have said
I was a doctor first.

23:55.393 --> 23:56.758
I think it sounded nice
either way.

23:56.936 --> 23:59.552
I'm going to get us a refill.

23:59.731 --> 24:01.596
- Oh, I can-- I can do it.
- I'm on it.

24:05.486 --> 24:06.737
Having fun?

24:09.073 --> 24:10.654
Yes, I am.

24:12.869 --> 24:14.405
That's kind of
a stupid question, right?

24:14.579 --> 24:16.661
( chuckles )
No.

24:18.750 --> 24:22.834
Still, this place has
a pretty amazing view.

24:23.004 --> 24:24.460
Yeah?

24:25.465 --> 24:27.205
Yeah, take a look.

24:33.848 --> 24:35.884
Ordinary life like before.

24:37.393 --> 24:39.645
Well, not like before.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.268
No.

24:41.439 --> 24:44.146
(sighs)
Yeah, no.

24:44.317 --> 24:46.353
I mean--
I mean, it's better.

24:46.527 --> 24:48.438
Not out there, in here.

24:51.282 --> 24:53.944
You know, everyone's been
through it somehow.

24:54.118 --> 24:56.450
Everyone.

24:56.621 --> 24:59.363
And a lot of things disappeared.

24:59.540 --> 25:01.997
But a lot of bullshit
went with it.

25:03.961 --> 25:08.625
They're all from totally different
backgrounds, different places.

25:08.800 --> 25:10.131
They never
would have even met.

25:10.301 --> 25:14.670
And now they're part
of each other's lives.

25:14.847 --> 25:16.929
They are each other's lives.

25:19.018 --> 25:23.307
I'm just saying,
we all lost things,

25:23.481 --> 25:25.722
but we got something back.

25:27.151 --> 25:30.860
It isn't enough,
but it's something.

25:33.366 --> 25:35.527
Carl:
No, it was a tie, man.

25:35.702 --> 25:37.567
You saw it, right?

25:42.417 --> 25:44.203
( Jessie chuckles )

25:46.003 --> 25:48.585
Yeah, yeah,
it's a pretty good view.

25:51.718 --> 25:52.798
Sam:
Mom.

25:52.969 --> 25:54.459
- Yeah?
- There's no more cookies.

25:54.637 --> 25:56.138
- Jessie: Oh.
- Rick: Well, oh--

25:56.305 --> 25:58.717
well, I happen to know
the cookie maker.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.427
She's a good friend
of mine.

26:00.601 --> 26:04.765
And I might be able to see about her
making a whole batch just for you.

26:04.939 --> 26:06.679
Mom, he doesn't have a stamp.

26:06.858 --> 26:08.519
Oh.

26:08.693 --> 26:10.274
Do you want a stamp?

26:10.445 --> 26:12.276
Sure.

26:20.037 --> 26:22.528
See? Now you're
officially one of us.

26:22.707 --> 26:24.618
Yeah.

26:24.792 --> 26:27.829
- Ron: Hey, Sam.
- Sam, wait, don't run.

26:30.590 --> 26:32.831
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

26:46.272 --> 26:46.351
( knocking )

26:46.355 --> 26:48.061
( knocking )

26:52.111 --> 26:54.193
Trying to make a getaway, huh?

26:54.363 --> 26:56.979
I can pretend I didn't make it.

27:00.495 --> 27:02.031
l'm Sasha.

27:04.707 --> 27:06.743
l'm Spencer.
Deanna's my mom.

27:06.918 --> 27:10.081
Your mom...

27:10.254 --> 27:11.505
she seems nice.

27:11.672 --> 27:12.878
Well, if you want
to hang with me,

27:13.049 --> 27:15.631
I'll make sure you don't get stuck
with Mrs. Neudermyer.

27:15.802 --> 27:19.761
She really, really likes talking about
how much she wants a pasta maker.

27:20.890 --> 27:23.427
It's not a conversation
you want to have.

27:23.601 --> 27:25.592
Excuse me.

27:30.358 --> 27:32.440
(slurping)

27:39.700 --> 27:41.952
(grunts)
Thanks.

27:43.663 --> 27:46.450
Mmm, when you're out there,

27:46.624 --> 27:48.910
if you happen to be
in a store or something,

27:49.085 --> 27:51.701
Mrs. Neudermyer is really looking
for a pasta maker.

27:51.879 --> 27:54.621
And we're all really trying
to get her to shut up about it.

27:54.799 --> 27:57.711
I mean, we have crates
of dried pasta in here,

27:57.885 --> 28:00.422
but she wants to make her own
or something.

28:00.596 --> 28:03.554
I really think she just wants
something to talk about, so...

28:03.724 --> 28:06.306
if you see one
out on your travels,

28:06.477 --> 28:08.718
it would go a long way to...

28:14.735 --> 28:16.771
I thought it was done.

28:16.946 --> 28:18.811
You didn't ask him already?

28:21.909 --> 28:23.900
Ask me what?

28:37.967 --> 28:40.583
When I got the place,
there was that frame

28:40.761 --> 28:42.262
and some parts and equipment.

28:43.347 --> 28:45.008
Whoever lived here built them.

28:46.934 --> 28:49.516
- It's a lot of parts for one bike.
- Yeah.

28:49.687 --> 28:51.348
Whenever I came across
any parts out there,

28:51.522 --> 28:53.058
I brought them back.

28:53.232 --> 28:55.348
I didn't know what I'd need.

28:55.526 --> 28:58.017
| always thought
I'd learn how to do it,

28:58.195 --> 29:01.858
but I get the feeling...

29:02.033 --> 29:03.989
you already know
what to do with it.

29:04.160 --> 29:08.324
And the thing is...

29:08.497 --> 29:09.703
you're going to need a bike.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.461
Why?

29:16.797 --> 29:19.129
ltold Deanna
not to give you a job

29:19.300 --> 29:23.885
because I think
l have one for you.

29:25.806 --> 29:29.094
I'd like you to be
Alexandria's other recruiter.

29:29.268 --> 29:31.805
I don't want Eric
risking his life anymore.

29:34.899 --> 29:36.639
You want me
risking mine, right?

29:36.817 --> 29:40.025
Yeah, because you know
what you're doing.

29:40.196 --> 29:42.187
You're good out there.

29:42.365 --> 29:45.027
But you don't belong out there.

29:45.201 --> 29:49.285
I know it's hard getting used
to people getting used to you.

29:49.455 --> 29:53.448
And I understand right now
you need to be out there sometimes.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.116
So do |.

29:58.923 --> 30:03.542
But the main reason
why I want you to help me recruit

30:03.719 --> 30:06.927
is because you do know
the difference

30:07.098 --> 30:09.760
between a good person
and a bad person.

30:22.279 --> 30:24.315
I got nothing else to do.

30:27.034 --> 30:29.195
Thanks.

30:29.370 --> 30:30.860
( silent )

30:32.790 --> 30:34.155
I'll get you some rabbits.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.949
( laughs )
Great.

30:37.128 --> 30:39.164
( chatter)

30:40.172 --> 30:41.958
( door opens)

30:46.137 --> 30:48.469
You packing
different steel nowadays?

30:48.639 --> 30:50.425
( chuckles )

30:51.934 --> 30:53.344
Yeah.

30:54.437 --> 30:57.929
Live by it, you die by it...

30:59.400 --> 31:01.516
and eat potato puffs by it.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.685
( chuckles )

31:06.532 --> 31:09.490
Pray to God you don't
have to use it again.

31:10.661 --> 31:14.153
Pray to God you don't get used
to not using it again.

31:18.002 --> 31:19.708
It's on your back...

31:21.130 --> 31:23.212
even when it's off your back.

31:25.342 --> 31:27.253
Hmm.

31:29.597 --> 31:32.430
How much
have you had to drink?

31:32.600 --> 31:34.591
( both laugh )

31:34.769 --> 31:37.602
lam a large man.

31:37.772 --> 31:40.855
And l have had many beers
to make up for that.

31:41.025 --> 31:43.311
Uh-huh.

31:43.486 --> 31:45.226
And you know what?

31:46.447 --> 31:49.689
By that brave act, I have--

31:51.160 --> 31:55.654
l have come to realize that things
have worked out pretty damn well for me.

31:57.083 --> 31:59.039
( chuckles )

32:00.920 --> 32:02.956
How about you?

32:03.130 --> 32:04.961
What have you done?

32:08.719 --> 32:10.630
I put on this dress.

32:14.350 --> 32:16.136
Try again.

32:51.262 --> 32:53.253
Sam:
What are you doing?

32:58.811 --> 33:00.893
Sam, what are you doing here?

33:01.897 --> 33:03.558
I followed you.

33:03.732 --> 33:05.768
l was hoping you were
going to make more cookies,

33:05.943 --> 33:08.275
but then you came here.

33:09.572 --> 33:11.483
Well, I could make more.

33:12.491 --> 33:13.867
I could make a whole batch
just for you.

33:14.034 --> 33:15.740
- Would you like that?
- Yes.

33:15.911 --> 33:18.288
I mean, yes, please.

33:18.455 --> 33:19.615
Okay.

33:19.790 --> 33:23.374
But you've got to promise me
you can keep it secret that I came here.

33:24.753 --> 33:26.129
But I'd have to tell my mom.

33:26.297 --> 33:28.629
I mean, I tell my mom
everything.

33:28.799 --> 33:33.168
You can never tell anyone,
especially your mom.

33:35.306 --> 33:37.342
Because if you do...

33:38.809 --> 33:41.141
one morning you'll wake up...

33:44.773 --> 33:46.980
and you won't be in your bed.

33:47.151 --> 33:49.267
Where will I be?

33:49.445 --> 33:52.903
You'll be outside the walls

33:53.073 --> 33:58.033
far, far away tied to a tree.

33:59.413 --> 34:03.907
And you'll scream and scream
because you'll be so afraid.

34:05.169 --> 34:07.751
No one will come to help

34:07.922 --> 34:11.460
because no one will hear you.

34:11.634 --> 34:15.547
Well, something
will hear you.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.837
The monsters will come.

34:18.015 --> 34:20.597
The ones out there.

34:20.768 --> 34:25.683
And you won't be able to run away
when they come for you.

34:25.856 --> 34:28.723
And they will tear you apart
and eat you up

34:28.901 --> 34:31.734
all while you're still alive.

34:31.904 --> 34:35.192
All while you can still feel it.

34:37.785 --> 34:40.618
And then afterwards,

34:40.788 --> 34:43.370
no one will ever know
what happened to you.

34:49.964 --> 34:52.546
Or you can promise

34:52.716 --> 34:56.709
not to ever tell anyone
what you saw here

34:56.887 --> 34:59.128
and then nothing will happen.

35:00.391 --> 35:03.007
And you'll get cookies.

35:03.185 --> 35:05.050
Lots of cookies.

35:10.150 --> 35:13.017
I know what I think
you should do.

35:15.406 --> 35:17.362
- ( music playing)
- ( chatter)

35:21.578 --> 35:23.830
That's a pretty good view,
too, isn't it?

35:27.793 --> 35:30.500
It's been a long time
since I held one of these.

35:37.970 --> 35:40.302
She and Carl...

35:42.099 --> 35:44.010
they're why I'm still here.

35:46.103 --> 35:49.721
And | get what
you've been telling me.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.353
What's that?

35:55.821 --> 35:57.652
Here isn't that bad.

36:01.910 --> 36:04.117
(Judith fusses )

36:04.288 --> 36:06.870
- Do you want to take her?
- Yeah.

36:47.414 --> 36:49.951
Sasha.
Come join us.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.831
I promise
all you have to do is listen.

36:52.002 --> 36:54.163
Come on.

36:54.338 --> 36:55.919
Okay.

37:01.845 --> 37:04.507
Bless her heart.
I don't get what takes her so long.

37:04.681 --> 37:06.057
I mean,
we only have one copy

37:06.225 --> 37:08.637
and the point of book club
is that we all read the book.

37:08.811 --> 37:10.972
ljust keep hoping that a dentist
shows up at our gates.

37:11.146 --> 37:12.135
It's his teeth.

37:12.314 --> 37:14.521
I mean, it'sjust so much better
when it's fresh.

37:14.691 --> 37:16.397
Woman: You know, I know how to work
one of those machines.

37:16.568 --> 37:18.524
- ( heart beating )
- Woman #2: Oh, they're amazing!

37:18.695 --> 37:22.233
- ( laughing )
- ( overlapping conversation echoing )

37:29.665 --> 37:32.202
I mean, it'sjust so much
better when it's fresh.

37:32.376 --> 37:35.493
(walkers snarling )

37:35.671 --> 37:37.878
Sasha,honey,
what's your favorite meal?

37:38.048 --> 37:39.288
I'd love to cook it for you
sometime.

37:39.466 --> 37:41.752
I'm doing it
for all the new arrivals.

37:41.927 --> 37:43.758
- I don't know.
- Of course you do.

37:43.929 --> 37:46.887
Everyone has favorites.
So what's yours?

37:48.308 --> 37:49.718
Whatever you want.

37:49.893 --> 37:53.135
I'm just worried that I'll end up
cooking something you hate, you know?

37:53.313 --> 37:54.894
You're worried?

37:56.233 --> 37:58.394
That's what you worry about?!

38:17.379 --> 38:20.121
I'm trying to figure out
what it is.

38:20.299 --> 38:22.210
What it is exactly.

38:27.431 --> 38:29.137
This...

38:33.979 --> 38:35.560
it isn't real.

38:35.731 --> 38:38.438
Sasha, you've been through a lot
and I accept that,

38:38.609 --> 38:40.349
but what you just said...

38:42.446 --> 38:44.061
that's bullshit.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.124
Take your pick.

39:05.302 --> 39:07.463
Look, I've been thinking.

39:07.638 --> 39:09.469
Do we really need these?

39:11.183 --> 39:12.923
I mean, things go bad,
yeah, sure.

39:13.101 --> 39:15.808
We do what we gotta do,
but it's like you said.

39:15.979 --> 39:17.355
We don't need these for that.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.388
Right now we don't.

39:22.402 --> 39:25.269
You wanted me to try, right?

39:25.447 --> 39:27.312
I'm good.

39:39.461 --> 39:41.918
( hammering )

39:54.935 --> 39:57.267
(sighs)

40:40.647 --> 40:41.932
Jessie:
Hey, Rick.

41:05.255 --> 41:07.416
(music playing )

41:10.093 --> 41:15.633
J‘ Where is the sun
that shone on my head? J‘

41:15.807 --> 41:17.798
( metal rattling )

41:17.976 --> 41:22.185
J‘ The sun in my life,
it is dead J‘

41:22.356 --> 41:24.221
J‘ It is dead J‘

41:25.859 --> 41:28.225
J‘ Where is the light J‘

41:28.403 --> 41:31.611
J‘ That would play
in my streets? J‘

41:31.782 --> 41:33.613
(walker snarling )

41:33.784 --> 41:37.993
J‘ And where are the friends
I could meet? J‘

41:38.163 --> 41:40.245
J‘ I could meet? J‘

41:41.625 --> 41:47.621
J‘ Where are the girls
I left far behind? J‘

41:49.299 --> 41:51.460
J‘ The spicks and the specks J‘

41:51.635 --> 41:55.298
J‘ Of the girls on my mind J‘

41:57.349 --> 42:03.094
J‘ Where is the sun
that shone on my head? J‘

42:05.023 --> 42:09.357
J‘ The sun in my life,
it is dead J‘

42:09.528 --> 42:11.439
J‘ It is dead. J‘

42:14.449 --> 42:14.483

42:14.491 --> 42:17.358
