WEBVTT

01:49.026 --> 01:52.487
Joanna called. She said we should meet her
at the courthouse garage.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.531
Joanna?

01:54.615 --> 01:56.825
Klein. The defense attorney
I told you about.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.120
She knows the system better than anyone.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.193
Oh, my God.

02:51.338 --> 02:52.381
Andy.

02:54.716 --> 02:57.219
Laurie, I'm Joanna Klein.

02:57.302 --> 02:58.595
Pleased to meet you.

02:58.679 --> 03:01.181
I'm so sorry
for what you're going through.

03:01.932 --> 03:02.933
Thank you.

03:04.268 --> 03:06.520
I have coffees in the car
in case you need one.

03:06.603 --> 03:07.855
No, that's okay.

03:07.938 --> 03:10.274
-Has Jacob arrived yet?
-He's on his way.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.650
How is he this morning?

03:12.359 --> 03:15.279
He's scared, but he is okay.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.783
Andy, you've been through this before,
but never from this side.

03:19.867 --> 03:23.996
And, Laurie, this will all be new to you,
so I'm gonna read you both the catechism.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.789
From this moment on,

03:25.873 --> 03:28.584
until you are back home
with the door closed behind you,

03:28.667 --> 03:32.004
I want you to show no emotion at all.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.006
Nothing.

03:34.089 --> 03:37.676
I know it's a lot to ask,
but it's important, okay?

03:38.302 --> 03:39.678
We're potted plants.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.138
Laurie?

03:42.806 --> 03:43.849
Yes.

03:43.932 --> 03:48.395
Unfortunately, every expression, every
reaction will be interpreted against you.

03:49.563 --> 03:53.984
Smile and they'll say
you're not taking it seriously.

03:54.735 --> 03:58.280
You cry and they'll say you're faking it.

03:58.780 --> 04:02.367
Do not answer any questions
they shout at you.

04:02.993 --> 04:06.079
On TV, only the pictures matter.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.882
And most important,

04:17.966 --> 04:21.970
any sign of anger,
particularly from Jacob,

04:22.053 --> 04:25.057
will confirm people's worst suspicions.

04:25.140 --> 04:29.811
You have to remember that, in their eyes,
it isn't just Jacob who's guilty.

04:30.354 --> 04:31.480
You all are.

04:33.106 --> 04:37.236
They're looking for confirmation,
so don't give it to them.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.530
Okay.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.074
Remember, poker faces.

04:45.661 --> 04:46.870
-You ready?
-Yeah.

04:46.954 --> 04:47.955
Okay.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.671
There they are!

04:55.754 --> 04:57.464
The Barbers. Grab the camera!

04:57.548 --> 05:00.217
Mr. and Mrs. Barber,
when did you last speak to Jacob?

05:00.300 --> 05:02.177
We're live on the air!

05:05.180 --> 05:08.016
Mrs. Barber,
when was the last time you saw your son?

05:10.185 --> 05:11.395
How's the family?

05:12.396 --> 05:14.523
How's the arrest affected your family?

05:20.487 --> 05:22.072
Just how are you doing?

05:24.283 --> 05:26.660
-Oh, my God.
-Are you okay?

05:26.743 --> 05:27.828
Yeah.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.493
...in ten minutes or something like that?

06:08.577 --> 06:11.413
This one should go pretty quick.
You know, ten minutes or so.

06:18.462 --> 06:19.588
Now what?

06:20.589 --> 06:21.798
Now we wait.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.388
Your attention, please.

06:28.472 --> 06:32.601
As you all know, last night the terrible
tragedy that struck our community

06:32.684 --> 06:36.146
was compounded in a way
that is truly difficult to fathom.

06:36.230 --> 06:40.067
I'm referring to the arrest of Jacob
Barber, an eighth-grader here at Archer.

06:42.319 --> 06:45.864
I want to stress how important it is
we not jump to conclusions.

06:46.281 --> 06:49.660
This means ignoring rumors
and refraining from spreading rumors.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.788
That said,

06:52.871 --> 06:57.000
if you do have information you feel
would be of help to the investigation,

06:57.084 --> 07:00.087
the police have asked that
you contact them immediately.

07:00.170 --> 07:03.799
You can do this directly
or through our guidance center.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.207
Hear ye! Hear ye! All rise.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.752
The Honorable Justice Rivera presiding.

07:40.836 --> 07:43.672
This court is now open. Please be seated.

07:46.216 --> 07:48.343
Good morning. Let's get started.

07:48.427 --> 07:49.887
Bring in the defendant.

08:10.365 --> 08:13.911
Indictment number 08-44-07.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.205
Commonwealth versus Jacob Owen Barber.

08:17.039 --> 08:20.042
The charge is one count of murder
in the first degree.

08:20.125 --> 08:21.835
Is the Commonwealth ready?

08:21.919 --> 08:23.670
Yes, it is, Your Honor.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.719
-Ms. Klein, how does the defendant plea?
-Jacob.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.847
Not guilty, Your Honor.

08:34.932 --> 08:37.058
Let's go to bail arguments. Commonwealth?

08:37.142 --> 08:39.061
Yes, Your Honor. If I may,

08:39.144 --> 08:42.481
we all know the defendant's father,
who is here with us today.

08:42.563 --> 08:44.942
We all have fond feelings
towards Mr. Barber.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.778
I, for one, have considered him to be
a mentor for many years.

08:47.861 --> 08:52.199
Mr. Logiudice, I presume you know
Mr. Barber isn't accused of anything.

08:53.075 --> 08:54.284
Of course, Your Honor.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.745
But his history with this case
is of great relevance

08:56.828 --> 08:58.914
to the argument I'd like to make
regarding bail.

08:58.997 --> 09:00.415
Make it then, counselor.

09:00.499 --> 09:02.000
Yes, Your Honor.

09:02.084 --> 09:05.838
Commonwealth seeks a bail
in the amount of 500,000 cash,

09:05.921 --> 09:07.214
five million surety.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.007
Oh, come on.

09:09.091 --> 09:12.052
Commonwealth feels the defendant
poses a particular risk of flight

09:12.135 --> 09:13.846
in light of the savagery of the crime

09:13.929 --> 09:15.889
and the overwhelming likelihood
of his conviction.

09:15.973 --> 09:20.143
Your Honor, the defendant has no priors.
He has no history of arrests.

09:20.227 --> 09:24.147
The court does not consider the defendant
a flight risk in the least.

09:24.231 --> 09:26.191
Bail is set
exactly where it was yesterday.

09:26.275 --> 09:28.861
Ten thousand. A hundred thousand surety.

09:28.944 --> 09:32.030
I'll be sending this case
to Judge French for trial,

09:32.114 --> 09:34.908
with pretrial set for August 21st.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.244
Thank you, Your Honor.

09:43.041 --> 09:45.419
-What happens now?
-It's okay. They're just gonna take him.

09:45.502 --> 09:47.796
It's just procedural.
We'll see him in a minute.

09:47.880 --> 09:49.131
Let's go.

09:54.720 --> 09:57.472
When you get home,
there are gonna be reporters.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.933
My assistant Ellen will swing by
with some groceries,

10:00.017 --> 10:01.476
but you can't stay shut in.

10:01.560 --> 10:04.730
Tomorrow you'll run a couple of errands,
you'll fill up the tank. Whatever.

10:04.813 --> 10:07.941
Just let them get their pictures
and they'll leave you alone.

10:10.027 --> 10:11.904
There's one more thing for you to sign.

10:18.535 --> 10:20.913
-Sign here, please.
-Sorry.

10:29.505 --> 10:31.089
Get close. He's coming out.

10:33.509 --> 10:34.885
Jacob! Jacob!

10:34.968 --> 10:37.804
Hey, hey, hey! Listen. Move, please.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.932
Give us a little room here, please.

10:42.935 --> 10:46.230
Out of the way. Get out of the way.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.399
Give 'em some space, please.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.950
Can we get a comment, please?

10:59.284 --> 11:00.911
Jacob, tell us how you're doing.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.037
Well?

11:03.497 --> 11:06.208
This makes it sound like
we hardly know each other.

11:06.667 --> 11:08.836
I don't know. I thought it read well.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.755
Your campaign manager
thinks it's the right tone.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.842
Well, he doesn't give a shit
who gets hurt, so long as it's not us.

11:15.968 --> 11:19.137
I'm sorry. It's just...

11:20.264 --> 11:23.308
It's usually Andy
whose advice I ask on things like this.

11:24.685 --> 11:26.144
In a million years...

11:26.645 --> 11:28.689
You need to issue some kind of statement.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.357
I know.

11:30.440 --> 11:33.402
So, hit send?

11:40.617 --> 11:41.869
It's the Barbers.

11:43.537 --> 11:45.247
They're here. Let's go. Let's go.

11:45.330 --> 11:50.002
That's right. Look out. They're coming.
Closer, okay? Come on. You got it?

12:07.978 --> 12:09.730
I don't have the heart to wake him.

12:15.194 --> 12:16.320
Jacob, honey.

12:21.742 --> 12:22.868
We're home.

12:31.168 --> 12:33.837
Are you hungry? Can I make you something?

12:33.921 --> 12:35.672
No, I just kinda wanna sleep.

12:35.756 --> 12:37.174
Yeah.

12:37.257 --> 12:40.219
Hey. We're really proud of you.

12:40.719 --> 12:43.680
The way you stood up there today,
that took a lot of guts.

12:43.764 --> 12:45.307
It was pretty scary.

12:46.308 --> 12:47.809
It's okay now.

12:47.893 --> 12:49.102
Go rest.

12:53.857 --> 12:58.570
And... I never got my phone back
from the police.

12:59.238 --> 13:02.741
All right, we'll get you another one.
Maybe a new laptop too.

13:03.825 --> 13:04.993
They took my computer?

13:05.077 --> 13:07.162
Yeah. It's just something
that happens when--

13:07.996 --> 13:09.706
It's just something that happens.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.001
Okay.

13:18.799 --> 13:19.800
Hello?

13:21.885 --> 13:23.387
Oh, my God.

13:23.470 --> 13:24.638
Who is this?

13:32.896 --> 13:35.941
I'll call the phone company tomorrow
and have them change the number.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.615
Hey. I had to speak to
that lawyer again today.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.241
The one in charge of Jacob's case.

14:26.825 --> 14:28.285
He keeps calling me.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.664
-Sarah, are you there?
-Yeah.

14:33.498 --> 14:36.418
Listen, I got homework, so I gotta go.

14:43.634 --> 14:45.511
In my experience, what we saw today,

14:45.594 --> 14:48.305
the body language, the cold stare,
the avoidance of any eye contact...

14:50.474 --> 14:53.185
...it's not a good look for someone
accused of a crime of this magnitude.

14:53.268 --> 14:56.563
He's out cold.
Probably sleep through the whole night.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.608
And quite frankly, it confirms a lot...

14:59.691 --> 15:01.485
I don't think this is a good idea.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.447
Have you seen what they're saying online?
What they're calling him?

15:05.531 --> 15:06.990
We gotta block this stuff out.

15:07.074 --> 15:09.117
They're saying
he looks smug and remorseless.

15:09.201 --> 15:11.328
-He's not even 15 years old.
-Oh, honey,

15:11.411 --> 15:13.080
it's par for the course.

15:13.163 --> 15:14.831
What's gonna happen when he sees this?

15:14.915 --> 15:16.917
Nothing's ever going to be the same
for him again.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.503
This is gonna follow him around
for the rest of his life.

15:19.586 --> 15:20.838
Laurie.

15:21.964 --> 15:23.006
What?

15:30.597 --> 15:31.849
What, Andy?

15:32.891 --> 15:33.892
Listen.

15:37.271 --> 15:39.356
I have to tell you something.

15:39.439 --> 15:41.441
Something that's gonna come out soon.

15:43.026 --> 15:44.236
About Jacob?

15:48.198 --> 15:49.324
About me.

15:51.285 --> 15:52.619
My family.

15:54.997 --> 15:55.998
My father.

16:10.429 --> 16:13.807
Jacob, before we begin,
I wanna make something clear.

16:13.891 --> 16:15.475
You're the client here.

16:15.559 --> 16:19.855
That means that as much as possible,
you are the decision maker.

16:19.938 --> 16:22.399
Not your parents, not me. You.

16:23.483 --> 16:27.070
To the extent you want to leave the
decision-making up to your mom and dad,

16:27.154 --> 16:28.197
that's understandable.

16:28.280 --> 16:30.115
But by law in Massachusetts,

16:30.199 --> 16:34.912
a kid your age charged with
first-degree murder is tried as an adult.

16:35.412 --> 16:39.291
So I'm gonna do my best
to treat you as an adult too, okay?

16:40.334 --> 16:41.710
-Okay.
-Now then.

16:42.294 --> 16:46.840
The theory seems to be
that Ben Rifkin was bullying you.

16:46.924 --> 16:48.091
You got a knife,

16:48.175 --> 16:51.386
and, when the opportunity
presented itself, took your revenge.

16:51.470 --> 16:53.305
Wait, he was bullying you?

16:54.056 --> 16:56.808
Not really. I mean, kind of, but--

16:56.892 --> 16:59.228
-What do you mean, kind of?
-You never said anything until now.

16:59.311 --> 17:01.271
-Why haven't you told us?
-I don't--

17:02.439 --> 17:04.942
He was a dick to a lot of people.
Not just me.

17:05.025 --> 17:07.027
Well, you still should've told us.
How was he bullying you?

17:07.109 --> 17:08.819
Andy, Laurie. Please.

17:10.614 --> 17:13.032
Now, as for the attack itself,

17:13.659 --> 17:16.286
there don't seem to be any witnesses.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.789
You have admitted to being in the park.

17:18.872 --> 17:21.208
And a fellow student alleges
you had a knife

17:21.290 --> 17:22.835
you would bring to school on occasion.

17:22.917 --> 17:24.837
That would be Derek. Derek Yoo.

17:24.920 --> 17:28.131
So it is a very circumstantial case.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.050
Now, there's the fingerprint.

17:30.133 --> 17:32.886
But fingerprints are
a very limited form of evidence.

17:32.970 --> 17:35.180
Often there's an innocent explanation.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.432
So you feel confident?

17:39.268 --> 17:40.894
There's one other thing.

17:41.562 --> 17:42.688
Laurie?

17:45.190 --> 17:46.817
I have to tell you something.

17:56.910 --> 18:00.330
You said yourself it's going to come out.
We're going to have to deal with it.

18:00.414 --> 18:02.833
Better he hear it from us now
than see it on the news.

18:02.916 --> 18:05.210
I'm sorry. Deal with what?

18:09.798 --> 18:10.799
Mom?

18:14.553 --> 18:17.764
Apparently, there's a history
of violence in our family.

18:19.057 --> 18:22.186
Honey, I'm sorry you have to find out
this way, but it's true.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.230
Sorry about this, Joanna.
This is my fault.

18:25.314 --> 18:28.192
-Laurie just heard about this last night.
-Heard about what?

18:31.153 --> 18:33.363
My father, your grandfather...

18:36.074 --> 18:37.159
He's in prison.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.536
He's been there for a very long time.

18:39.620 --> 18:41.705
Last time I saw him I was six years old.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.333
My mother took me to see him in prison
right after his arrest.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.335
You said he left
when you were just a baby.

18:46.418 --> 18:50.214
That's what I told everybody growing up.
It's the same lie my mother told people.

18:51.173 --> 18:53.717
But you said you never knew your father.

18:53.800 --> 18:54.968
I know.

18:56.637 --> 18:57.971
I was ashamed of him.

18:58.931 --> 19:00.182
So you lied to me.

19:00.265 --> 19:01.725
So you've been lying to me.

19:01.808 --> 19:03.519
I'm so sorry, Laurie.

19:04.686 --> 19:07.189
I did not tell you the whole truth. No.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.152
What did he do?

19:20.744 --> 19:21.995
He killed a girl.

19:24.206 --> 19:25.707
Who was she?

19:25.791 --> 19:27.835
She was a student
at the community college.

19:27.918 --> 19:31.421
They found her body in a boarded-up
row house on Congress Ave.

19:31.880 --> 19:33.841
She had been stabbed to death.

19:33.924 --> 19:35.300
What?

19:38.679 --> 19:41.348
I wanted to tell you so many times,
Laurie. I swear.

19:42.641 --> 19:43.684
Then why didn't you?

19:43.767 --> 19:45.936
It's just what I come from.
It's not who I am.

19:46.019 --> 19:48.605
Seventeen years, Andy?
You didn't trust me to understand that?

19:48.689 --> 19:52.234
I was afraid that if I said anything
it would change the way you saw me.

19:52.317 --> 19:54.736
And then it would have been for nothing
because it means nothing.

19:54.820 --> 19:56.196
Does it?

20:07.082 --> 20:08.709
Now I understand.

20:11.128 --> 20:14.631
I'm not saying Logiudice won't try
to dredge this up in some capacity,

20:14.715 --> 20:16.341
but he won't get anywhere with it.

20:16.884 --> 20:19.219
Except maybe
in the court of public opinion.

20:19.303 --> 20:20.762
Are you sure?

20:21.305 --> 20:23.682
Laurie's concerned that the prosecution
will somehow argue

20:23.765 --> 20:26.018
a genetic predisposition.

20:26.101 --> 20:28.187
I was reading about it online
this morning.

20:28.729 --> 20:30.772
Apparently,
there have been cases like this

20:30.856 --> 20:33.192
where that kind of thing
has been used as evidence.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.484
They call it the "murder gene."

20:34.568 --> 20:36.028
That's ridiculous.

20:36.111 --> 20:38.030
You think I have the murder gene?

20:38.113 --> 20:39.907
No. It's just a phrase.

20:40.324 --> 20:43.785
Our only worry is if something like this
could be used against you.

20:43.869 --> 20:45.954
I highly doubt it would be admissible.

20:46.038 --> 20:47.456
That doesn't mean they wouldn't try,

20:47.539 --> 20:49.458
but if they do,
we will fight it tooth and nail.

20:49.541 --> 20:51.919
I have to go to the bathroom.
I don't feel good.

20:52.002 --> 20:55.047
Mary, would you please show Jacob
where the bathroom is?

20:55.130 --> 20:56.173
Yeah, of course.

20:57.799 --> 20:58.926
Right this way.

21:02.638 --> 21:05.140
Jesus Christ.
Did you have to bring it up right now?

21:05.891 --> 21:07.434
He has a right to the truth.

21:07.893 --> 21:10.562
I won't tolerate any more lying.
Not from you, not from him.

21:10.646 --> 21:14.149
-From him? What, the bullying?
-He never said a word about it.

21:14.233 --> 21:16.401
He made it sound like
they barely knew each other.

21:16.485 --> 21:18.445
-And the fingerprint--
-He explained the fingerprint.

21:18.529 --> 21:21.949
-He found the body, and he panicked.
-He never said a word about that either.

21:22.032 --> 21:24.701
I just think we all need
to come clean with each other.

21:25.369 --> 21:26.745
No more secrets.

21:32.626 --> 21:35.003
Maybe this is enough for today.

21:41.051 --> 21:42.928
-Here you go.
-Appreciate it.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.681
You should've told me.

21:46.098 --> 21:49.142
Sweetheart, we're all still figuring out
how to process all of this.

21:49.226 --> 21:50.644
I didn't tell anyone, Jake.

21:51.228 --> 21:53.230
I was afraid
of how people would look at me.

21:53.313 --> 21:55.274
Just like now I'm afraid
of how people will look at you.

21:55.357 --> 21:56.692
Why shouldn't they?

21:57.901 --> 21:58.986
It's who I am, right?

21:59.069 --> 22:00.737
-Jacob.
-It's okay.

22:01.780 --> 22:03.824
He's angry at me, and I don't blame him.

22:07.578 --> 22:08.912
That's not who you are.

22:10.163 --> 22:11.707
How do you know?

22:13.125 --> 22:15.377
Maybe Mom is right. Maybe I'm--

22:15.460 --> 22:17.713
-Maybe I've got the murder gene.
-I never said that.

22:17.796 --> 22:19.381
The murder gene is bullshit.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.008
Maybe not. Maybe I'm just like him.

22:21.091 --> 22:22.176
Hey!

22:23.260 --> 22:24.803
Enough, okay?

22:24.887 --> 22:28.140
He's one guy, one bad man.
He has nothing to do with you.

22:28.223 --> 22:30.267
Don't you see?
This is what I was worried about.

22:30.350 --> 22:31.810
This is why I kept it from you.

22:31.894 --> 22:33.562
You had a right to not know.

22:33.645 --> 22:37.024
To start with a clean slate.
Not have it hanging over your head like--

22:38.442 --> 22:39.776
Thank you.

22:43.655 --> 22:44.656
Thank you.

22:49.578 --> 22:50.579
Shit.

23:02.466 --> 23:03.509
Just ignore it.

23:35.165 --> 23:36.291
Andy.

23:37.084 --> 23:39.378
I'm sorry. I didn't--
I thought you'd be alone.

23:39.461 --> 23:41.255
I get her every other week.

23:41.672 --> 23:43.799
It's okay, sweetheart.
It's a friend from work.

23:44.883 --> 23:45.968
Wait here.

23:46.051 --> 23:48.595
Come on. Let's go inside.
You can watch some TV.

24:05.237 --> 24:06.488
She's gotten big.

24:06.572 --> 24:07.990
Let's talk out back.

24:12.077 --> 24:14.413
The fuck are you doing here?
You trying to get me suspended?

24:14.496 --> 24:16.456
-I need your help.
-With what?

24:16.540 --> 24:17.666
Leonard Patz.

24:17.749 --> 24:18.917
Jesus Christ, Andy.

24:19.001 --> 24:21.170
Come on, Duff.
We both know there were red flags there.

24:21.253 --> 24:22.462
Don't say that.

24:22.546 --> 24:24.131
-Say what?
-Shit like "we both know."

24:24.214 --> 24:26.300
You know that if Lynn hadn't
moved on to Jacob so fast,

24:26.383 --> 24:28.927
-Patz would still be on your radar.
-How do you know he's not?

24:29.970 --> 24:30.971
Is he?

24:31.471 --> 24:33.724
I haven't forgotten about him,
if that's what you're asking.

24:34.224 --> 24:35.893
But he's not a priority.

24:36.894 --> 24:38.103
Not anymore. No.

24:38.187 --> 24:40.272
-He is to me.
-I don't doubt that.

24:41.148 --> 24:42.649
What exactly are you getting at?

24:42.733 --> 24:45.402
I wanna dig deeper into Leonard Patz.
I wanna see his case file.

24:45.485 --> 24:46.612
So?

24:46.695 --> 24:48.155
So, you seized my computer.

24:49.072 --> 24:50.657
No one would need to know.

24:50.741 --> 24:52.868
Even if they did, it's not illegal.
It's just improper.

24:52.951 --> 24:55.704
Yeah, I'll remember that when
I'm writing speeding tickets on the Pike.

24:55.787 --> 24:57.122
-Please, Duff.
-No.

24:57.206 --> 24:58.373
I get why you're pursuing this.

24:58.457 --> 25:01.460
I'd probably do the same thing
if I was in your shoes, but I'm not.

25:02.961 --> 25:04.796
I'm asking you as a friend.

25:05.297 --> 25:06.632
All I need is his file.

25:08.634 --> 25:09.801
A friend?

25:10.302 --> 25:11.386
What?

25:11.470 --> 25:14.348
Come on, man. We worked together.
It's not like we ever hung out.

25:14.932 --> 25:17.809
The first time I set foot in your house
was with a warrant.

25:20.312 --> 25:21.688
Wow, that's--

25:23.232 --> 25:26.610
I always thought we were friends.
I'm sorry you didn't feel the same way.

25:27.319 --> 25:28.946
Look, don't get me wrong.
You're a good guy.

25:29.029 --> 25:31.698
But if this is what you think
an actual friendship is,

25:31.782 --> 25:33.784
it's you I feel sorry for.

25:37.496 --> 25:38.497
Mama?

25:39.039 --> 25:40.916
-Yeah, I'm coming, sweetheart.
-Okay.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.085
Is that all or...

25:51.510 --> 25:52.511
Andy.

25:54.263 --> 25:55.347
Andy?

25:57.182 --> 25:58.225
Andy.

26:02.729 --> 26:06.733
I asked if you could describe for us
the first few weeks after Jacob's arrest.

26:11.780 --> 26:13.156
Let's see.

26:15.993 --> 26:18.203
I think it started with a Sunday.

26:18.287 --> 26:19.705
Then a Monday.

26:20.664 --> 26:22.833
Pretty sure a Tuesday came next.

26:25.961 --> 26:27.129
Always stay precise, Neal.

26:27.212 --> 26:29.840
The scope of any query
should be as narrow as possible.

26:29.923 --> 26:32.301
One of your many nuggets, yes.

26:33.510 --> 26:35.888
All right. I'll rephrase the question.

26:37.639 --> 26:41.143
Could you describe for us the atmosphere
in your household

26:41.226 --> 26:42.936
in the weeks after Jacob's arrest?

26:43.020 --> 26:45.439
-The atmosphere?
-Oh, God.

26:45.522 --> 26:48.192
Just make me say what you want me to say.
It's not that hard.

26:48.275 --> 26:51.653
You wanna know if Jacob seemed guilty.
Have the balls to ask it.

26:51.737 --> 26:54.198
All right. Did he?

26:54.281 --> 26:55.866
I have no idea.

26:56.658 --> 27:00.162
He was 14 years old. He had just been
ripped away from his whole life.

27:00.245 --> 27:04.541
-His classmates, activities--
-I'm sorry. His classmates?

27:05.083 --> 27:06.126
Yes.

27:06.210 --> 27:09.796
For a man so concerned with precision,
I find it curious you didn't say friends.

27:10.297 --> 27:11.673
Oh, come on, Neal.

27:11.757 --> 27:13.675
-Jacob had friends then?
-Yes.

27:15.552 --> 27:16.637
Some, yes.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.347
Was Ben Rifkin a friend?

27:18.430 --> 27:21.767
No. He said that Ben
could be a jerk to him sometimes.

27:22.392 --> 27:25.479
You know, just... name-calling.

27:25.979 --> 27:27.481
What sort of names?

27:29.441 --> 27:31.193
I don't know. The usual stuff.

27:31.610 --> 27:33.237
Did he call Jacob a "faggot"?

27:34.738 --> 27:35.781
Yes.

27:35.864 --> 27:37.282
More than once?

27:39.409 --> 27:41.203
That's my understanding.

27:44.122 --> 27:48.460
So, Jacob being removed from his routine
affected his demeanor.

27:48.544 --> 27:49.962
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

27:51.755 --> 27:54.091
Plus, being all over TV and the Internet,

27:54.758 --> 27:59.137
just sort of... shut down
for a little while.

28:00.222 --> 28:01.557
At least initially.

28:03.684 --> 28:06.270
So he was aware
of his burgeoning celebrity.

28:07.020 --> 28:08.063
Yeah.

28:09.106 --> 28:10.858
We urged him not to look.

28:12.276 --> 28:15.821
He stayed busy with schoolwork.
Still eight weeks left in the school year.

28:15.904 --> 28:17.072
School?

28:19.575 --> 28:21.076
Yeah, we hired him a tutor.

28:22.077 --> 28:23.120
Mrs. Mandel.

28:23.203 --> 28:25.205
Was Jacob's second grade teacher,
now retired.

28:25.289 --> 28:27.374
We figured that would make it
less awkward.

28:27.457 --> 28:28.709
And did it?

28:28.792 --> 28:31.128
I don't know. Maybe.

28:31.211 --> 28:34.590
Like I said,
he just kinda retreated into himself.

28:34.673 --> 28:36.008
We all did, to some degree.

28:39.011 --> 28:40.721
It's just a really hard time.

28:42.681 --> 28:43.891
For Laurie too?

28:50.230 --> 28:54.359
All I meant was that if you look at
the true cost of a program like that,

28:54.443 --> 28:59.323
not just our direct expenses,
but the staff salary, the additional--

29:00.199 --> 29:01.408
Laurie.

29:07.539 --> 29:08.832
How are you, Laurie?

29:10.751 --> 29:14.004
Not great, but glad to be back.

29:15.756 --> 29:16.882
May I...

29:18.509 --> 29:19.801
Sure, yes.

29:27.476 --> 29:29.728
We've all been thinking about you.

29:29.811 --> 29:32.314
We didn't expect to see you back so soon.

29:32.397 --> 29:35.192
Yeah, well, I could use the distraction.

29:35.859 --> 29:40.280
Staring at the walls half the day,
I figured I could at least do some good.

29:43.158 --> 29:47.079
We were just reviewing
our field trip budget for next year.

29:47.162 --> 29:48.372
Okay.

29:50.207 --> 29:51.458
What the fuck?

30:04.596 --> 30:06.682
-Do you have a minute?
-Sure.

30:13.981 --> 30:18.902
I just got off of a conference call
with some of our board members,

30:18.986 --> 30:21.029
including legal advisory.

30:21.613 --> 30:26.660
They all feel strongly that
your return to work might be premature.

30:26.743 --> 30:28.745
Look, I'm fine. I swear.

30:28.829 --> 30:30.539
You're not hearing me, Laurie.

30:32.416 --> 30:36.378
This isn't gonna work for us.
Not right now.

30:38.380 --> 30:41.300
You know how much we love you here.

30:41.967 --> 30:48.223
How grateful we are for everything you've
done over these past, what, seven years?

30:48.307 --> 30:49.308
Eight.

30:50.350 --> 30:51.727
We just...

30:52.603 --> 30:54.521
We're a haven for these kids.

30:55.647 --> 30:58.317
We're supposed to be
the safest place available to them.

30:58.400 --> 31:00.944
And you feel my being here is somehow--

31:01.028 --> 31:02.613
No. Not you.

31:03.572 --> 31:04.823
It's more--

31:06.658 --> 31:12.039
The board is worried about
any kind of negative association.

31:13.624 --> 31:16.543
We're skating on thin ice financially
as it is.

31:19.922 --> 31:21.048
I see.

31:22.382 --> 31:25.219
This isn't necessarily permanent.

31:25.302 --> 31:27.804
No one is firing you.

31:27.888 --> 31:31.308
We just feel that now isn't the time.

31:32.476 --> 31:33.602
Not yet.

31:37.940 --> 31:38.982
Well, when then?

31:41.610 --> 31:42.611
I--

31:48.325 --> 31:50.410
I'm sorry, honey.

31:51.328 --> 31:53.914
For everything you're going through.

31:58.710 --> 32:00.003
Thank you.

32:17.729 --> 32:19.064
Hi, Mrs. Barber.

32:34.246 --> 32:37.165
All right. I'm shooting him.
I'm shooting him. Go in. Go in. Go in.

32:37.249 --> 32:38.750
You're dead.

32:39.835 --> 32:41.170
Shoot him.

32:42.379 --> 32:44.006
How are you so bad at this game?

32:44.882 --> 32:46.049
You're so dead.

32:49.052 --> 32:50.137
Hey, bud.

32:53.682 --> 32:56.518
How 'bout taking a break?
You've been playing for a couple hours.

33:05.777 --> 33:06.945
Jake.

33:12.451 --> 33:15.078
Okay, I have to go. All right.

33:20.834 --> 33:22.794
-When's dinner?
-Soon as Mom gets home.

33:22.878 --> 33:24.421
Who you playing with?

33:24.505 --> 33:26.256
I don't know. Just some guy.

33:26.340 --> 33:27.466
You don't know his name?

33:28.217 --> 33:32.763
I think he said it was, like, Tim or Tom.

33:32.846 --> 33:34.014
You tell him your name?

33:35.098 --> 33:37.059
I don't know. Yeah, probably.

33:39.895 --> 33:42.481
You gotta be careful
what you say on there, buddy.

33:42.564 --> 33:44.191
It's just trash talk.

33:44.274 --> 33:47.319
I know, but people take things
out of context, they record stuff.

33:47.402 --> 33:48.987
This is why you can't be on social media.

33:49.071 --> 33:52.074
All this stuff gets stored somewhere.
It's a prosecutor's fantasy.

33:52.157 --> 33:53.700
-We've talked about this.
-I know.

33:53.784 --> 33:55.661
-So you're staying off it?
-Yes.

34:03.418 --> 34:04.503
Okay.

34:05.921 --> 34:08.674
Look, I'm sorry. I know this is tough,
but it's really important.

34:08.757 --> 34:11.176
I don't mind if you play the games.
You just gotta be careful.

34:11.635 --> 34:13.594
With your phone, with your texts.
Everything.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.597
Yeah. No, I get it.

34:18.225 --> 34:19.226
Okay.

34:19.309 --> 34:21.937
You know, Dylan says I'm famous.

34:24.022 --> 34:25.107
Talking to Dylan?

34:25.190 --> 34:26.692
Yeah, we were playing before.

34:26.775 --> 34:32.697
He was saying there's, like,
a fan page online.

34:32.781 --> 34:35.909
Started by some girl in Ohio
or Iowa or something like that.

34:35.993 --> 34:37.202
Jesus Christ.

34:37.286 --> 34:38.745
Kinda wanna see it though.

34:38.829 --> 34:40.205
Don't.

34:40.289 --> 34:45.127
Okay? It's a bad idea. Just... don't.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.302
Shouldn't Mom be home by now?

34:53.385 --> 34:55.596
I'm gonna call her.
Why don't you set the table?

35:26.919 --> 35:28.837
Starting to wonder where you were.

35:28.921 --> 35:30.297
I was driving.

35:30.881 --> 35:31.882
What do you mean?

35:32.716 --> 35:34.134
I just needed to--

35:35.552 --> 35:36.637
I don't know.

35:38.847 --> 35:40.057
How'd it go at work?

35:40.516 --> 35:42.017
That was...

35:43.685 --> 35:44.937
Oh, my God.

35:52.152 --> 35:54.112
Go inside. I'll handle this.

36:18.136 --> 36:19.304
Hey, Mom.

36:20.305 --> 36:21.473
I'll be right there.

37:33.879 --> 37:36.089
All right. I get it. You love me.

38:50.873 --> 38:53.000
Happy birthday!

39:04.469 --> 39:06.013
Jacob!

39:55.687 --> 39:58.148
Whose idea was it to consult Dr. Vogel?

39:59.650 --> 40:01.693
Jacob's lawyer recommended her.

40:01.777 --> 40:06.823
Dr. Vogel is considered an authority
in genetic inheritance in behavior,

40:06.907 --> 40:08.867
-is she not?
-She is.

40:08.951 --> 40:13.372
I thought Ms. Klein was of the opinion
that hereditary evidence had no value.

40:13.455 --> 40:16.542
Well, she thought we might need
to confront it if it came up in trial.

40:16.625 --> 40:18.460
It's called being a good lawyer.

40:20.963 --> 40:25.300
And her initial session with Jacob
was on May 25th?

40:25.384 --> 40:26.510
Is that right?

40:27.386 --> 40:28.637
Yeah, that sounds right.

40:33.475 --> 40:35.227
We met with her first.

40:55.414 --> 40:58.041
Toby wants to drop off dinner
for us tonight.

40:58.125 --> 40:59.418
Really?

40:59.501 --> 41:01.336
It's what you do when someone dies.

41:02.462 --> 41:04.214
She wants to be there for you.

41:04.298 --> 41:06.383
If you don't let people in,
they're gonna think you don't want 'em.

41:06.466 --> 41:07.885
I know.

41:09.636 --> 41:12.264
Duffy came through, by the way.
With the Patz file.

41:12.931 --> 41:14.600
Does she think that Patz did this?

41:14.683 --> 41:17.144
Well, she can't say that, but we can.

41:17.227 --> 41:18.395
Patz checks all the boxes.

41:18.478 --> 41:20.439
We just gotta make
a credible case to the jury.

41:21.607 --> 41:24.193
-That was nice of her.
-Yeah.

41:24.276 --> 41:27.487
See, people are looking out for us.

41:30.282 --> 41:32.117
Andy was still in law school.

41:32.201 --> 41:34.411
We hadn't even been together a year.

41:34.494 --> 41:36.371
So was the pregnancy unplanned?

41:36.455 --> 41:38.582
Yeah, but we were happy about it.

41:38.665 --> 41:40.501
We were practically engaged at that point.

41:40.584 --> 41:42.336
We were excited.

41:42.419 --> 41:44.963
But we were just kids ourselves.
We had a lot to learn.

41:47.299 --> 41:50.385
So, how would you describe
Jacob as an infant?

41:50.469 --> 41:51.637
-Beautiful.
-Difficult.

41:53.138 --> 41:55.557
Of course he was beautiful,
that's not what she--

41:56.225 --> 41:57.976
That's not what you were asking, was it?

41:58.060 --> 42:00.062
Well, when you say difficult, in what way?

42:00.938 --> 42:02.648
Well, he cried constantly.

42:02.731 --> 42:04.274
You'd think he was being tortured.

42:04.775 --> 42:08.403
At first we chalked it up to colic,
but it never really went away.

42:08.487 --> 42:10.072
As a baby, I mean.

42:10.155 --> 42:11.740
Was he quick to console?

42:11.823 --> 42:13.450
-For the most part, yeah.
-Not really.

42:16.578 --> 42:18.914
There were a few temper tantrums.
Things like that. Yeah.

42:18.997 --> 42:20.541
Well, they were more than just tantrums.

42:23.710 --> 42:25.170
Well, he'd throw things at us.

42:25.254 --> 42:29.091
Scream for hours maybe.
You couldn't get him to stop.

42:29.174 --> 42:31.051
That doesn't sound too unusual.

42:31.134 --> 42:34.054
It wasn't.
I think Laurie's being a little dramatic.

42:37.933 --> 42:41.353
How was Jacob with other children
as a toddler?

42:44.940 --> 42:46.024
Laurie?

42:49.111 --> 42:51.947
Okay. Let me just pause here for a second
and make something really clear.

42:52.030 --> 42:53.782
I was hired by your defense team.

42:54.366 --> 42:55.617
I work for you.

42:55.701 --> 42:57.870
-I'm on Jacob's side.
-We know that.

42:57.953 --> 43:00.747
Okay. So you know these conversations
are entirely confidential,

43:00.831 --> 43:03.000
so there's absolutely
no reason to hold back.

43:03.083 --> 43:04.084
Not in this room.

43:04.168 --> 43:07.045
I'm just trying to get
the most complete picture possible.

43:14.136 --> 43:16.013
Well, he didn't do well in day care.

43:17.014 --> 43:20.142
He got too rough with the other kids.
There were complaints.

43:20.225 --> 43:22.728
-Complaints?
-It was a few neurotic parents.

43:22.811 --> 43:24.813
He once pushed a girl
off a play structure.

43:24.897 --> 43:26.523
She needed stitches.

43:26.607 --> 43:29.318
And one boy accused him of biting,
only Jacob denied it.

43:29.401 --> 43:31.445
He was a four-year-old boy.
What are we talking about here?

43:31.528 --> 43:34.281
Okay, Andy. Let her speak.
You'll have your turn. Go on, Laurie.

43:34.364 --> 43:36.116
I'm just trying to talk honestly, Andy.

43:36.200 --> 43:38.702
No. You're making it seem like Jacob
has something to answer for.

43:38.785 --> 43:39.912
And he doesn't.

43:39.995 --> 43:42.039
He was a little boy.
You're reading into every little thing.

43:42.122 --> 43:43.373
That's what you always said.

43:43.457 --> 43:45.792
You never wanted to admit
anything could ever be wrong.

43:45.876 --> 43:48.837
He was an ordinary boy
with ordinary problems.

43:49.630 --> 43:51.089
Like any other boy.

43:52.049 --> 43:53.842
Our pediatrician said the same thing.

43:55.469 --> 43:58.931
She thought that Jacob
was young, emotionally,

43:59.014 --> 44:01.808
and that he should repeat
a year of kindergarten to catch up.

44:01.892 --> 44:04.394
-And it would pass.
-And it did pass.

44:04.478 --> 44:06.146
-The pediatrician was right.
-Was she?

44:06.230 --> 44:07.689
Honey, look where we are.

44:12.861 --> 44:14.446
What do you mean by that, Laurie?

44:16.031 --> 44:18.033
Do you have any doubts
about Jacob's innocence?

44:18.116 --> 44:20.744
-No. Of course not.
-And if you do, that's okay.

44:20.827 --> 44:22.746
I don't. Not in the slightest.

44:22.829 --> 44:24.998
I was just trying to answer
your questions honestly.

44:25.082 --> 44:26.583
It's what you told us to do.

44:26.667 --> 44:28.126
-Understood.
-I mean it.

44:28.210 --> 44:30.379
I know what he is capable of
and what he isn't.

44:30.462 --> 44:32.422
-Okay.
-A mother knows her child.

44:58.532 --> 45:00.075
Toby's here.

45:10.586 --> 45:12.045
-Hey, honey.
-Hi.

45:14.006 --> 45:15.757
This is really sweet of you. Thank you.

45:15.841 --> 45:16.842
Please.

45:20.596 --> 45:21.597
How are you?

45:22.097 --> 45:26.059
Hanging in. It's just all so--

45:26.143 --> 45:27.352
I'm sure.

45:28.604 --> 45:30.355
Sweetheart.

45:31.773 --> 45:32.858
It's gonna be okay.

45:33.817 --> 45:35.485
I don't know.

45:36.111 --> 45:37.362
I really don't.

45:40.324 --> 45:42.618
Hey, bud. What was today?

45:43.035 --> 45:45.454
Global, Bio, and Spanish.

45:46.163 --> 45:47.789
I think I liked her better
in second grade.

45:47.873 --> 45:52.669
I mean, she's nice and all,
but she takes forever explaining things.

45:52.753 --> 45:54.421
Plus, I don't think
she even knows Spanish.

45:55.088 --> 45:57.591
She pronounces años "anus."

46:00.093 --> 46:01.803
Hey, honey. Sounds like Jacob's--

46:03.597 --> 46:05.807
-What's going on?
-Mom?

46:08.310 --> 46:11.563
What happened is that
Gary doesn't want her seeing me anymore.

46:12.564 --> 46:14.733
She wanted to tell me face-to-face.

46:15.234 --> 46:16.777
That's insane. You're her best friend.

46:16.860 --> 46:19.071
Yeah, well, Gary's her husband,

46:19.154 --> 46:21.698
and he went to Cornell
with Dan Rifkin, so--

46:24.868 --> 46:26.537
There are leftovers from last night.

47:13.458 --> 47:14.918
You could tool around in this.

47:15.002 --> 47:16.795
But I got-- No, I'd recommend this one.

47:17.462 --> 47:19.423
Of course. You gotta earn your money.

47:33.353 --> 47:34.521
Hey, Sarah.

47:36.023 --> 47:37.232
How's practice going?

47:53.790 --> 47:55.542
This is Detective Duffy.

47:56.585 --> 47:57.586
Hello?

47:58.670 --> 47:59.755
Hello?

48:00.172 --> 48:02.549
You said to call if we knew anything
about Ben's murder.

48:04.301 --> 48:06.178
Yes. Right. Who am I speaking with?

48:09.389 --> 48:13.227
My name is Sarah. Sarah Grohl.

48:17.689 --> 48:19.024
"Where's the hat?"

48:20.192 --> 48:22.152
Hey, buddy. Dinner.

48:28.742 --> 48:31.036
Honey! Dinner!

48:37.584 --> 48:38.710
Honey!

48:40.462 --> 48:42.673
"Fifty dollars."

48:44.132 --> 48:46.593
Laurie! Dinner!

48:53.725 --> 48:54.893
Laurie!

49:02.860 --> 49:04.069
Laurie?
