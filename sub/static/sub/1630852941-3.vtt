who just got transferred here.

00:23.090 --> 00:26.420
Where is the office
for the Behavioral Analysis Team?

00:26.930 --> 00:29.520
The Behavioral Analysis Team?
I'm not sure where that is.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.060
Have you heard of that team?

00:31.060 --> 00:34.000
No, I have never heard of it.
We had a team like that?

00:34.000 --> 00:35.390
Same here.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.070
Is it new?

00:37.070 --> 00:39.660
It's my first time hearing it.
We don't know where it is.

00:39.810 --> 00:42.670
The Behavioral Analysis Team?
What do people do there?

01:11.470 --> 01:13.700
Hello.
Hi.

01:18.480 --> 01:20.740
Hello.
Who are you?

01:20.950 --> 01:22.950
I'm a statistics analyst.
I was transferred here as of today.

01:22.950 --> 01:24.180
My name is Jung Woo Ju.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.940
I see. Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you too.

01:26.490 --> 01:27.910
See you later.
Okay.

01:33.830 --> 01:37.450

02:00.050 --> 02:01.050
Okay.

02:01.050 --> 02:03.120
(Changeui Substation)

02:03.120 --> 02:05.520
As you can see,
we already filed your child missing.

02:06.230 --> 02:07.690
If we hear anything about Soo Hyun,

02:07.690 --> 02:09.460
we will call you right away.

02:09.460 --> 02:11.460
Staying here won't help the case.

02:11.460 --> 02:13.920
So you should go back home.

02:13.970 --> 02:17.960
But it's been over a week already.

02:19.870 --> 02:21.600
You don't think my daughter...

02:22.510 --> 02:24.270
could have been...
No.

02:24.680 --> 02:26.040
Don't say that.

02:26.150 --> 02:28.550
A lot of children get lost
and stay at a shelter.

02:28.550 --> 02:30.470
Then they call us.

02:30.720 --> 02:34.280
So don't worry too much.
Let's give it some time.

02:34.890 --> 02:36.190
Thank you.
Sure.

02:36.190 --> 02:38.530
Bye.
Bye.

02:38.530 --> 02:40.780
We'll wait for your call.
Sure. Bye.

02:41.760 --> 02:42.890
Dad.

02:43.630 --> 02:45.060
When is Soo Hyun coming back?

02:45.870 --> 02:47.260
She'll be home soon.

02:55.380 --> 02:59.270
Gosh. We're going to a prison
on a gorgeous day like today?

02:59.350 --> 03:00.770
Should we play hooky today?

03:01.180 --> 03:02.650
Today is our first meeting.

03:02.650 --> 03:04.370
I was just joking.

03:04.680 --> 03:06.410
Don't be so serious.

03:08.090 --> 03:09.510
Goodness. This is nice.

Hey, how come we only have
outdated items in the inventory?

04:22.330 --> 04:24.600
Does this thing even work? Does it?

04:24.600 --> 04:25.860
Goodness. It works.

04:26.130 --> 04:28.160
First of all, don't be nervous.

04:33.040 --> 04:35.630
We'll call you once we're done.

04:38.550 --> 04:40.380
Take a seat.

We are police officers who study
the psychology of criminals.

05:07.510 --> 05:08.710
You're just cops.

05:08.710 --> 05:10.680
Why are you giving me a complicated title?

05:10.680 --> 05:14.170
We came here today because
we want to know why...

05:14.380 --> 05:15.720
you committed such a crime six years ago.

05:15.720 --> 05:17.140
You barge in here...

05:17.680 --> 05:20.040
because you want to know
what happened six years ago?

05:20.220 --> 05:21.590
As I told you,

05:21.590 --> 05:23.650
it's to study the psychology of criminals.

05:25.990 --> 05:27.980
What's in it for me?

05:28.930 --> 05:30.290
None.

05:30.730 --> 05:32.030
At least give me some cigarettes.

05:32.030 --> 05:34.600
Let me say this again.
You will get any benefits.

05:34.600 --> 05:36.540
Why would I tell you...

05:36.540 --> 05:38.510
what happened six years ago again...

05:38.510 --> 05:40.760
if I'm not getting anything in return?

05:41.040 --> 05:43.470
We're just trying to put together
the wrong answers for data.

05:49.220 --> 05:51.040
Wrong answers.
I haven't heard that for a while.

05:52.750 --> 05:55.450
I used to make my students
put together the notes after exams.

05:57.620 --> 06:00.120
You mean when you were a teacher
at Bugyeong Elementary School?

06:00.430 --> 06:02.750
You already know everything.
What else do you want to know?

06:03.430 --> 06:04.620
We have your case file.

06:04.830 --> 06:07.430
But we're interested in your thoughts.

06:07.430 --> 06:11.390
Right. We can't find them
in your case file.

06:12.510 --> 06:15.340
I thought it would be fun to meet cops.

06:15.340 --> 06:16.570
But it's no fun.

06:16.740 --> 06:18.310
Officer! We're done here.

06:18.310 --> 06:20.200
Six years ago,
you cut your lover, Lee Geum Ju,

06:20.710 --> 06:22.610
into 23 body parts.

06:36.360 --> 06:38.190
You don't know everything, I guess.

06:40.630 --> 06:42.830
It's 24 pieces.

06:45.770 --> 06:47.570
It says 23 on the case file.

06:47.570 --> 06:48.970
Arms and legs...

06:50.580 --> 06:53.870
Cut them off and divide them into two.
How many do you have?

06:58.850 --> 07:00.380
There are nine.

07:01.650 --> 07:03.380
You can't do math.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.550
Then you cut her neck,
pulled out her eyeballs,

07:05.790 --> 07:07.460
cut her nose and ears,
split her lips into two,

07:07.460 --> 07:09.790
and cut off two breasts,
thumbs, and big toes.

07:11.130 --> 07:12.820
That adds up to 23.

07:14.870 --> 07:16.230

07:27.880 --> 07:29.870
(Keep quiet)

07:38.020 --> 07:39.650
Did you cut off her tongue?

07:40.560 --> 07:42.520
She talked too much.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.550
You see, I...

07:44.800 --> 07:47.990
She was dead, for sure.
But she wouldn't stop talking.

07:48.130 --> 07:52.930
That witch kept on talking,
so I bit it off. Like this.

07:54.840 --> 07:56.930
Then it was better.

07:58.410 --> 08:00.570
Do you have gum? Can I have a piece?

08:04.750 --> 08:06.010
You chewed it off?

08:06.890 --> 08:07.890
Her tongue?

08:07.890 --> 08:09.150
Why?

08:19.200 --> 08:22.060
We should wrap this up here today.

08:22.270 --> 08:24.000
I need to use the bathroom.

08:24.000 --> 08:25.670
We'll wait.
It hasn't even been ten minutes yet.

08:25.670 --> 08:27.800
Desperate ones
are bound to take initiative.

08:29.110 --> 08:33.809
Let me make the call
so I'd want to talk to you.

08:33.809 --> 08:36.909
Don't you prefer this
over being locked up in your cell?

Oh, boy.

09:19.060 --> 09:20.590
Do you go to church?

09:20.590 --> 09:24.420
I'm Catholic, but I haven't been
to church for a long time.

09:24.860 --> 09:27.070
Ever since I got this job,

09:27.070 --> 09:29.360
I've been struggling to believe
in the all-powerful creator.

09:31.240 --> 09:33.370
It's better than believing in humans.

If doomsday were to come,

would be wiped out, right?

Gosh, I'm sorry.

10:32.900 --> 10:34.790
I was running around all day, so I forgot.

10:35.000 --> 10:38.570
Just go home. We'll talk tomorrow.

10:38.570 --> 10:40.800
Okay. I'm sorry.

10:42.240 --> 10:44.610

to look after the newbie.

10:52.850 --> 10:54.680
I'm starving. Let's go eat something.

10:55.120 --> 10:57.280
I don't feel like eating.
I'll just head home.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.130
You should still eat something.

10:59.130 --> 11:01.620
Come on.
I don't want to eat alone at home.

11:01.730 --> 11:03.020
Your family must be waiting for you.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.920

I've been living alone since last year.

11:09.400 --> 11:11.700
No, it's not what you're thinking.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.930
My wife and kids are abroad now.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.230
They're abroad?
Yes.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.080
What was the program called?

11:18.080 --> 11:20.880
Anyway, a school in Singapore
offered a scholarship,

11:20.880 --> 11:22.340
so I sent them there.

11:22.380 --> 11:23.680
Your kids must be smart.

11:23.680 --> 11:25.680
Yes, thankfully. They take after my wife.

11:26.990 --> 11:28.080
Oh, boy.

11:29.160 --> 11:32.080
Anyway, this job is
always so unstable, you know.

11:32.390 --> 11:34.090
It sounded like a good opportunity,
so I sent them.

11:34.090 --> 11:36.130
But living alone is awful.

11:36.130 --> 11:40.290
Everyone says they're jealous,
but they have no idea.

but that was it.

11:44.100 --> 11:45.570

16:04.360 --> 16:06.620
Anyone would think
you're totally relaxed right now.

16:07.070 --> 16:08.870
How much longer
will you just sit back and watch?

16:08.870 --> 16:11.200
We have to attend
the press forum later today.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.870
That's later.

16:12.870 --> 16:15.100
Pick up your camera and go.

16:16.040 --> 16:17.040
Go where?

16:17.040 --> 16:20.570
Anywhere where you can score a big scoop.

16:21.650 --> 16:23.680
Reporter Choi, run!

16:23.680 --> 16:25.210
Yes, sir.
Run!

16:25.950 --> 16:28.020
All right, it's time to step up your game!

16:28.020 --> 16:29.380
I'll see you later.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.530
("Additional Body Parts Found
in Bumyeong-dong")

16:35.530 --> 16:37.490
What is this world turning into?

16:37.860 --> 16:39.690
These scumbags...

16:46.910 --> 16:49.370
Hello, sir.
Yes, hello.

16:55.650 --> 16:56.840
That's my desk.

16:59.350 --> 17:02.180
I'm sorry, sir.
I don't have anywhere to sit.

17:03.860 --> 17:06.020
You saw the news, right?
Yes.

17:06.290 --> 17:07.420
Hello, sir.

17:08.690 --> 17:10.900
What was your name again?
Jung Woo Ju, sir.

17:10.900 --> 17:13.470
I've been assigned to the team
as a statistics analyst.

17:13.470 --> 17:15.900
Right, it's nice to meet you.
I'm Captain Kook Young Soo.

17:15.900 --> 17:18.660
This is Inspector Song Ha Young,
our criminal behavioral analyst.

17:18.839 --> 17:22.400
The victim is a five-year-old girl.

17:22.680 --> 17:24.869
She's five?
Yes.

17:27.079 --> 17:28.200
Sorry to interrupt.

17:29.780 --> 17:32.490
I don't have a desk.

17:32.490 --> 17:35.240
Oh, hold on. A desk...

17:35.250 --> 17:37.280
Just let him use this one.

17:38.320 --> 17:39.860
Gil Pyo, you need to let...

17:39.860 --> 17:41.450
the Behavioral Analysis Team
take part in this case.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.530
Where are you? Gil Pyo. Are you in here?

17:44.530 --> 17:47.300
Hey, I get it. I'll talk to the team.

17:47.300 --> 17:49.020
Gil Pyo, we met Jang Deuk...

17:50.070 --> 17:51.930
We had an interview
with a mutilation murderer.

17:53.270 --> 17:55.260
What's with you?

17:55.440 --> 17:57.980
Hey, do you think this is children's play?

17:57.980 --> 18:00.780
I already have a headache as is.
Does it sound like I'm joking?

18:00.780 --> 18:02.540
I said I'll talk to them!

18:13.290 --> 18:15.280
Excuse me.

18:16.330 --> 18:17.790
Where should I put this?

18:17.960 --> 18:19.620
Wherever you want to sit.

18:19.970 --> 18:21.390
Wherever I want... Okay.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.160
Where I want to sit.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.900
(Found eight mutilated body pieces
of the victim, a young child.)

18:43.820 --> 18:46.220
Is your blood type B?
Yes.

18:48.260 --> 18:50.320
Was that an insult?
Sorry?

18:52.130 --> 18:54.720
No, I wouldn't. My blood type is B too.

18:55.400 --> 18:56.530
I see.

18:57.100 --> 18:58.560
("Enragement with Child Mutilation,
the Police Want More Reports")

18:59.170 --> 19:01.360
Why did you apply
for the Behavioral Analysis Team?

19:01.710 --> 19:02.900
It looked cool.

19:05.080 --> 19:07.340
Behavioral Analysis Team.

19:07.710 --> 19:09.610
It already sounds cool.

19:09.780 --> 19:12.850
Behavioral Analysis Team
of Detective Division,

19:12.850 --> 19:14.510
Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.

19:16.460 --> 19:17.780
I'm the statistics analyst.

19:21.330 --> 19:22.450
Cool.

19:27.870 --> 19:29.660
Do you know the story
of the blind man and a lantern?

19:31.900 --> 19:33.440
Sorry?
Someone asked a blind man...

19:33.440 --> 19:36.430
who walks down a dark road
with a lantern in his hand.

19:36.740 --> 19:38.310
"You can't see anyway."

19:38.310 --> 19:39.800
"Why do you carry that around?"

19:42.750 --> 19:44.240
Why do you think so?

19:45.120 --> 19:47.410
Why was he carrying that?

19:49.050 --> 19:53.680
He wanted others to see clearly
and not fall down while walking.

19:55.830 --> 19:58.690
He lit up the road for others,
not for himself.

20:02.870 --> 20:04.990
It's tough to last
unless you have this attitude...

20:05.240 --> 20:08.000
when you start a career
in coming across criminals.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.470
I see.

20:17.780 --> 20:21.210
You stashed us in a storage
as if we got demoted.

20:21.390 --> 20:22.760
And we only have two men.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.050
No, it's finally three.

20:25.160 --> 20:26.790
We're only called
the Behavioral Analysis Team.

20:26.790 --> 20:27.790
What is this?

20:27.790 --> 20:29.600
Hey, Special Crime Squad is
very busy right now.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.160
We don't even have a moment to smoke.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.070
You know what it's like. Cut it out.

20:33.070 --> 20:35.190
We aren't some hecklers.

20:35.300 --> 20:37.440
We're trying to help out
with the investigation.

20:37.440 --> 20:39.930
I know, but it's still too early.

20:39.970 --> 20:42.170
You know that people don't know...

20:42.170 --> 20:44.210
what exactly
the Behavioral Analysis Team does.

20:44.210 --> 20:45.830
Of course.

20:46.050 --> 20:48.180
You stashed us in some shabby storage.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.880
We couldn't find the budget
or the opening for new personnel,

20:49.880 --> 20:52.570
but you insisted
on making the team in haste.

20:52.720 --> 20:55.140
That was the only room available.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.390
We report directly
to the Detective Division,

20:57.390 --> 20:58.720
I'll consult Superintendent Baek directly.

20:58.720 --> 21:00.380
Hey, wait. Stop right there.

21:01.390 --> 21:04.020
Directly or whatever,
you aren't the chief anymore.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.090
You have to get through me.

21:06.470 --> 21:07.990
I know we're close,

21:08.170 --> 21:10.140
but let's not destroy
the reporting levels.

21:10.140 --> 21:12.390
What do you expect, then?
One second.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.200
My phone smells weird.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.100
Why?
I think something is served.

21:18.310 --> 21:19.500
You got served.

21:21.950 --> 21:25.310
You wouldn't listen to me
when I tried to stop you!

21:25.480 --> 21:28.590
Hey, others are
dying to climb up the ladder.

21:28.590 --> 21:30.120
No one told you to get demoted.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.560
I was willing to lay it down
because this job is that important.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.430
Whatever. I'm going directly
to the captain.

21:35.430 --> 21:37.550
Hey, wait. Get back here.

21:38.300 --> 21:39.700
Stay conscious of the men above...

21:39.700 --> 21:41.920
and continue to interview inmates.

21:42.200 --> 21:46.410
Then at least share the daily report
of the investigation with us.

21:46.410 --> 21:48.240
How can I share that as I like?

21:48.240 --> 21:49.340
What can you share, then?

21:49.340 --> 21:50.710
My love for you.

21:50.710 --> 21:53.000
I can always share that.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.550
Good grief.

21:54.550 --> 21:56.280
I'm ordering jjajangmyeon.
Do you want some?

21:56.280 --> 21:57.410
No.

21:58.350 --> 22:00.850
The police noted that
there were no calls made...

22:00.850 --> 22:03.520
by the culprit to demand money
from the family of the victim,

22:03.520 --> 22:04.960
so they speculate
that it may have been done...

22:04.960 --> 22:06.650
by a mentally ill person.
What happened?

22:08.390 --> 22:09.730
They won't even share
the investigation reports?

22:09.730 --> 22:11.100
I'm going to meet the captain
of the Special Crime Squad.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.930
Who's the captain of Team Two again?

22:12.930 --> 22:14.260
Captain Yoon Tae Gu.

22:15.630 --> 22:16.840
Have you worked together?

22:16.840 --> 22:19.170
For a short while, in Jungbu Station.
I'll come too.

22:19.170 --> 22:21.060
Sounds great. Come with me.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.900
(Special Crime Squad 1)

22:29.050 --> 22:30.140

22:35.090 --> 22:37.550
They walked out
of Chief Heo's office just now.

22:37.620 --> 22:39.550
I think they want us
to share the case reports.

22:40.690 --> 22:42.850
Make sure they don't freeload on our case.

22:43.100 --> 22:44.850
I'll manage.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.460
Nice to meet you.

22:52.810 --> 22:54.560
How may I help you?

22:55.370 --> 22:57.830
My name is Kook Young Soo.
I was formerly in Forensics Squad.

23:00.410 --> 23:02.340
Chief Kook Young Soo of Forensics Squad.

23:03.050 --> 23:06.080
You made a name for yourself,
so I know who you are.

23:06.080 --> 23:08.380
Thank you.
It has been a while.

23:10.090 --> 23:11.180
Yes.

23:15.290 --> 23:17.290
"Criminal behavioral analyst?"

23:17.400 --> 23:19.620
I'm studying the psychology of criminals.

23:19.930 --> 23:22.570
I meet with inmates in prison,
conduct interviews,

23:22.570 --> 23:24.290
and turn them into data.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.790
What do you do with them?

23:26.840 --> 23:28.500
Do you test for their types?

23:33.250 --> 23:36.040
It was a joke.
I'm sorry if you were offended.

23:36.050 --> 23:37.410
No, it's all right.

23:37.820 --> 23:40.180
Not many know about our team,
so I understand.

23:40.450 --> 23:41.650
Why don't we grab a seat?

23:41.650 --> 23:43.690
I'm a little busy right now.

23:43.690 --> 23:45.850
I see.
Okay.

23:46.090 --> 23:48.280
I had my first interview
with a mutilation murderer.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.960
If we find out
the psychology of the criminal,

23:51.960 --> 23:53.730
we can prevent another crime.

23:53.730 --> 23:57.540
We are in a rush to resolve the case
instead of preventing it.

23:57.540 --> 23:59.070
I understand. It's true, but...

23:59.070 --> 24:00.740
Instead of arresting culprits,

24:00.740 --> 24:01.910
Behavioral Analysis Team aims...

24:01.910 --> 24:03.540
to prevent similar crimes
from breaking out, but...

24:03.540 --> 24:06.000
Even if all of us end up unemployed,

24:06.180 --> 24:09.110
it would be wonderful
to see a day like that.

24:09.110 --> 24:10.240
Isn't that so?

24:13.550 --> 24:15.940
We'd like to help with this investigation.

24:16.890 --> 24:20.380
The detectives in charge are
more than competent.

24:20.590 --> 24:22.350
I doubt it was done
by a mentally ill person.

24:24.460 --> 24:26.130
It seems like
you're stepping over the line.

24:26.130 --> 24:27.420
Why are you so defensive?

24:30.670 --> 24:34.360
Goodness, why are you two
going on with different topics?

24:34.940 --> 24:37.040
Captain Yoon, we came to see you today...

24:37.040 --> 24:38.880
to help out with the investigation.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.670
We don't mean anything else,
so don't take it the wrong way.

24:40.810 --> 24:42.740
We are the ones to decide...

24:43.880 --> 24:45.770
if you will be helpful or not.

24:46.180 --> 24:49.050
As you can see,
we are unbelievably busy...

24:49.050 --> 24:50.820
because we don't even have a suspect...

24:50.820 --> 24:52.680
of that darned mutilation murderer.

24:53.130 --> 24:55.490
So we do not have
enough resources to cooperate...

24:55.490 --> 24:58.560
with your great plan
of criminal analysis or whatnot.

24:58.560 --> 24:59.990
In that case,

25:01.130 --> 25:03.670
could you please share
the investigation reports?

25:03.670 --> 25:05.570
You're probably asking
although you know it's impossible.

25:05.570 --> 25:07.970
I'm sorry to say that
there's nothing I can share.

25:07.970 --> 25:10.880
We just want to help you
find a suspect of the case.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.770
As you know, I'm very busy.

25:15.610 --> 25:17.070

we'll call it the Changeui-dong case.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.000
You know that I transferred
to Behavioral Analysis Team, right?

26:19.140 --> 26:21.240
I heard about it,
but what do you do there?

26:21.810 --> 26:24.650
People were talking
and saying you were demoted.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.940
You probably won't understand
even if I explained this now.

Which one? The mutilated five-year-old?

26:35.590 --> 26:38.250
Yes.
Why are you asking me?

26:38.960 --> 26:41.590
It's a complicated story.

26:42.400 --> 26:44.540
So you really weren't demoted?

26:44.540 --> 26:45.930
Hey, you punk.

26:46.470 --> 26:48.370
Am I someone who would get demoted?

No way, you are
the godfather of Forensics.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.280
If anything, you should be promoted.

26:52.280 --> 26:53.370
Precisely.

26:53.810 --> 26:58.140
You found nothing
on the scene or on her body?

26:58.580 --> 27:02.080
Nothing. He cut up even the kid's fingers.

27:02.320 --> 27:03.510
Fingers?

27:05.260 --> 27:08.480
I find these cases horrifying
no matter how many times I see them.

27:08.690 --> 27:10.190
I can never get used to this.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.660
So he put it in a black plastic bag,

27:12.660 --> 27:14.320
put it in a backpack,
then threw it out, correct?

27:15.470 --> 27:18.330
When the parts were found,
they were frozen.

27:18.870 --> 27:21.830

but the section looked very neat.

27:23.910 --> 27:25.630
Let me borrow your pen.

27:26.240 --> 27:29.040
The body was cut after it was frozen.

27:29.250 --> 27:30.910
The cross-section is neatly cut.

27:32.180 --> 27:34.020
Where did she go missing
and when was she abducted?

27:34.020 --> 27:35.140

27:36.720 --> 27:39.080

27:40.260 --> 27:41.880
I have them in my office.

27:42.790 --> 27:44.650
But I can't share them.

I'll just look at them.

Okay.

What? What are you doing?

28:07.420 --> 28:10.620
Hey, you know that you became the chief...

28:10.620 --> 28:12.250

28:12.690 --> 28:14.190
even though people were
pointing fingers at me.

28:14.190 --> 28:15.930
Yes, I do.

28:15.930 --> 28:18.450
Give me a second. Come on.

28:19.930 --> 28:21.120

Thanks.

28:38.620 --> 28:40.210
How many do you have?

28:54.270 --> 28:56.830
If the culprit severed
the body parts not to get caught,

28:56.970 --> 29:00.730
why would the culprit abandon
the body parts nearby?

29:00.740 --> 29:03.030
You're talking to me, right?

29:05.210 --> 29:06.370
I'm going out.

29:06.580 --> 29:09.040
I'll be late. If Captain Kook
doesn't come back, go home.

29:09.280 --> 29:10.440
Okay.

29:17.990 --> 29:19.180

actually saying hello to me first.

30:04.370 --> 30:06.240

Yes, sir.
You're not...

30:29.460 --> 30:32.190
going to the office now. Right?

Oh, I...

30:41.640 --> 30:42.740
Hello?

30:42.740 --> 30:45.010
You know that
I rarely call in favors. Right?

30:45.010 --> 30:46.240
But I know that when you start with that,

30:46.240 --> 30:48.100
you want something from me.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.470
What is it this time?

30:49.850 --> 30:51.780
If you know anything, give me some intel.

30:51.780 --> 30:53.990
Come on. Don't ask me that. Bye.

30:53.990 --> 30:56.610
Hey, don't hang up.

30:56.620 --> 31:00.020
I really need to find a lead.
Can you help me out here?

31:03.300 --> 31:06.320
Gosh. Why did he just hang up on me?

31:21.510 --> 31:22.600
See?

31:23.010 --> 31:26.210
Desperate ones
are bound to take initiative.

31:27.590 --> 31:29.640
Do you feel like talking to me now?

31:29.750 --> 31:31.110
No. Not yet.

Turn that off.

31:45.340 --> 31:47.640
Happy now?
A bit.

31:47.640 --> 31:49.430
Don't you feel guilty?

31:49.470 --> 31:51.280
You brutally killed a woman.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.000
She was already dead anyway.

31:53.510 --> 31:54.670
I didn't have a choice.

31:55.910 --> 31:59.740
What's the point of holding
onto the past and regretting it?

32:02.090 --> 32:04.150
It's not regretting. It's repenting.

32:06.060 --> 32:07.280
Do you know something?

32:07.990 --> 32:10.050
Your eyes...

32:11.260 --> 32:12.950
seem so familiar.

32:17.140 --> 32:18.660
There's a void...

32:19.340 --> 32:21.170
in your eyes.

32:21.170 --> 32:24.170
Stop making jokes.
I'm serious.

32:25.810 --> 32:28.640
Fine. I'm human, after all.

32:28.980 --> 32:31.840
I do feel guilty from time to time.

32:40.690 --> 32:41.880
Right.

32:46.930 --> 32:48.120
You too.

32:48.830 --> 32:52.390
That just showed that
you could turn into a monster too.

32:53.270 --> 32:54.560
I'm just one step away?

32:54.810 --> 32:55.900
Yes.

32:56.010 --> 32:58.670
You can't consider guilt
the same as murder.

33:03.110 --> 33:06.340
That's the difference between
humans and monsters like you.

33:06.480 --> 33:08.820
You think a heinous crime like that
is the same as being unethical.

33:08.820 --> 33:10.180
That's an indeed horrendous thought.

33:11.020 --> 33:12.580
A horrendous thought.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.960
Do you know what's really horrid?

33:22.970 --> 33:26.090
Severing the body.

33:26.400 --> 33:30.040
Swoosh.

33:30.040 --> 33:32.730
Swoosh!

33:38.480 --> 33:39.970
Then why did you do it?

33:41.450 --> 33:44.710
Do you think I did it for fun?

33:45.290 --> 33:47.450
It takes a lot of time and is exhausting.

33:48.930 --> 33:50.190
Think about it.

33:50.260 --> 33:52.700
Where could I go
while carrying someone that big?

33:52.700 --> 33:55.260
Where could I hide her?

33:57.000 --> 33:59.060
Cutting her up wasn't easy.

33:59.170 --> 34:00.500
That wench.

34:03.410 --> 34:05.470
So you cut her up to move around easily?

34:07.180 --> 34:08.900
If that was the only reason,

34:09.380 --> 34:11.870
you wouldn't have removed
her eyes or tongue.

34:12.980 --> 34:16.310
You got half right.
The other half is wrong.

34:18.659 --> 34:19.780

I see.

How did you get them?

From my connection.

35:14.610 --> 35:17.480
Wait. Let's see.

You're missing the time and locations.

35:20.090 --> 35:22.120
Oh, that? I got it.

Goodness.

35:46.880 --> 35:48.350
You're back.
Yes.

35:48.720 --> 35:51.350
Did anyone hold grudges
against her parents?

35:51.930 --> 35:54.750
We haven't found anyone so far.
We still have to look further.

35:54.760 --> 35:57.390
This is the file from Forensics.
I checked them by time.

35:59.320 --> 36:01.260
Did you eat?

36:01.260 --> 36:03.530
Do you want to go to a sauna?
It should be open by now.

36:03.530 --> 36:04.860
There was no ransom.

36:04.860 --> 36:06.530
So I doubt the culprit was after money.

36:06.530 --> 36:07.630
Given the brutality of the crime,

36:07.630 --> 36:09.070
we can look into people...

36:09.070 --> 36:10.840
who might have held grudges
against her parents.

36:11.510 --> 36:13.450
But the Special Crime Squad
hasn't gotten that far yet.

36:13.450 --> 36:14.820
That's why they must have
narrowed it down...

36:14.820 --> 36:16.180
to someone who is mentally unstable.

36:16.180 --> 36:19.510
But the body was cut too neatly
for someone who's mentally unstable.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.750
The culprit cut her up by her joints.

36:24.760 --> 36:26.930
It means that the culprit knew the method.

36:26.930 --> 36:29.720
And each body part was put
in different plastic bags.

36:30.300 --> 36:31.560
Just looking at the evidence,

36:33.900 --> 36:36.160
the culprit must be
used to cutting things up.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.930
What kind of job
one should have to be skilled at it?

36:38.860 --> 36:41.500
This is going back to square one,

36:42.110 --> 36:43.770
but why were they discarded
in the same area?

36:43.970 --> 36:45.240
It's easier to find.

36:45.550 --> 36:48.670
Maybe he just didn't have the means
to move them elsewhere.

36:53.650 --> 36:55.310
But this...
They were double-bagged, right?

36:56.550 --> 36:58.580
Yes, you're right.

36:59.220 --> 37:01.220
Why did he double-bag them?

37:04.700 --> 37:06.090
Maybe he works at a slaughterhouse.

37:09.700 --> 37:11.700
That's possible.
A slaughterhouse worker.

37:12.130 --> 37:13.360
(Slaughterhouse worker)

37:13.360 --> 37:15.430
It's possible
that he used a cutting machine.

37:16.030 --> 37:18.300
And the way
the body parts were frozen too.

37:18.300 --> 37:19.840
But would a slaughterhouse worker...

37:20.570 --> 37:22.510
put the body parts so neatly
in plastic bags?

37:22.510 --> 37:25.340
Then maybe he's someone
who works at a butcher shop.

37:25.550 --> 37:26.740
Oh, that's right.

37:26.990 --> 37:28.090
When you buy meat,

37:28.090 --> 37:29.650
they double-bag it in black plastic bags.

37:29.650 --> 37:30.950
Fish too.

37:31.150 --> 37:32.450
Judging by the way they were cut,

37:32.450 --> 37:35.450
I'd say he's a butcher,
not someone who handles fish.

37:35.450 --> 37:37.900
But doesn't he have to work
during the day?

37:37.900 --> 37:40.490
Business owners can set
their own work schedules.

37:40.490 --> 37:41.630
Or...

37:42.430 --> 37:44.200
he's someone
who used to have that kind of job.

37:44.200 --> 37:45.660
Who's unemployed now.

37:48.430 --> 37:50.600
(Unemployed)

37:51.740 --> 37:54.970
And they said he'd probably be
someone with a mental illness.

37:55.220 --> 37:56.450
But if he's mentally unstable...

37:56.450 --> 37:58.280
I'm not sure.

37:58.510 --> 37:59.990
It's highly unlikely...

37:59.990 --> 38:03.760
because people like that
can't really plan a crime like this.

38:03.760 --> 38:04.950
And the way they were cut...

38:04.950 --> 38:07.390
tells me that it has to be someone
who is skilled at cutting things.

38:07.650 --> 38:10.690
Exactly. That's how we should
approach this. We should...

Do not underestimate or doubt
what the Special Crime Squad can do.

40:53.590 --> 40:55.450
If you truly want to help us,

40:55.990 --> 40:59.360
do what you have to do
in your own position.

41:29.300 --> 41:30.960
Hey, Lotte won yesterday.

41:33.760 --> 41:34.860
My gosh.

41:36.130 --> 41:39.240
Oh, dear. It's so hot, isn't it?
Yes.

41:39.240 --> 41:42.870
We can't use the AC before July.

41:43.010 --> 41:44.200
Chief Heo.

41:44.200 --> 41:47.100
Can you please brief us on the progress?

41:47.180 --> 41:48.550
Do you have a suspect yet?

41:48.550 --> 41:50.510
I'll certainly let you know
if there is any progress.

41:50.510 --> 41:54.380
What? All eyes are on this case now.

41:54.380 --> 41:56.720
Are you saying
there still has been no progress?

41:56.720 --> 42:01.450
Come on. You know that
we're all busting our butts now.

42:02.530 --> 42:05.200
Well, everything is classified
except for the info...

42:05.200 --> 42:06.390
that has been reported on the media,

42:06.700 --> 42:08.930
so we can't tell you anything
at the moment. Please understand.

42:09.430 --> 42:11.300
Please use that exact wording
when reporting my statement.

42:11.300 --> 42:12.340
I have to go.

42:12.340 --> 42:14.180
Come on!
Tell us what's going on!

42:14.180 --> 42:16.780
Don't do this to us!
This is crazy!

42:31.320 --> 42:32.580
Did you stay up all night?

42:33.780 --> 42:35.250
What brings you here?

42:35.360 --> 42:37.220
Hey, I transferred
to the Intelligence Unit here...

42:37.220 --> 42:38.420
two weeks ago.

42:38.990 --> 42:40.320
Really?

42:40.530 --> 42:42.030
You must be very busy these days.

42:42.800 --> 42:43.930
Yes, as always.

42:45.800 --> 42:48.400
How can we chat and share information...

42:48.400 --> 42:50.130
with someone who doesn't smoke?

42:50.130 --> 42:52.180
She's no fun.

42:52.180 --> 42:53.700
She's difficult to work with.

42:53.700 --> 42:55.010
Goodness.

42:55.380 --> 42:57.070
They say women are chatty,

42:57.070 --> 42:59.080
but men are worse in my opinion.

43:01.090 --> 43:03.150
How's the investigation going?
Any progress?

43:03.150 --> 43:05.430
Well, it's not easy.

43:05.430 --> 43:06.550
Because you're in charge...

in Changeui-dong,

43:08.700 --> 43:11.400
losers like them are watching you
with their eyes peeled.

43:11.400 --> 43:12.490
Really?

43:12.800 --> 43:15.660
Everyone in the police force
knows that you're a star player.

43:15.900 --> 43:17.200
I can't believe
people are still complaining...

43:17.200 --> 43:19.500
about a woman leading
the Special Crime Squad.

43:20.880 --> 43:23.670
Losers. They're so pathetic.

43:24.550 --> 43:25.970
I'm so happy that you're here.

43:27.110 --> 43:28.440
Take it easy.
You too.

43:30.780 --> 43:32.480
Come, over here!

43:34.880 --> 43:36.080
A butcher.

43:36.680 --> 43:39.580
The victim went missing
at a park during the day,

43:40.220 --> 43:42.090
and the body parts were found
in a residential area nearby.

43:42.130 --> 43:43.850
(Missing, Lee Soo Hyun, Age 5)

43:43.950 --> 43:45.720
It means the culprit lives in the area.

43:45.720 --> 43:47.130
(Tae Ho's Corner Shop)

43:47.130 --> 43:49.230
And it has to be someone
who doesn't have a set schedule.

43:50.740 --> 43:52.760
What kind of trait does the culprit have?

43:54.630 --> 43:56.030
Why did he kidnap her?

43:57.800 --> 43:59.700
Why did he dismember her body?

44:01.610 --> 44:04.140
The body parts were found
in black plastic bags.

44:04.950 --> 44:06.310
They were double-bagged.

44:09.510 --> 44:10.950
Who is the culprit?

44:11.880 --> 44:14.760
I must find the culprit
who killed a five-year-old kid.

Come here!
Hey!

44:30.470 --> 44:32.470
Hey, wait up!

44:32.470 --> 44:33.800
Where is he hiding?

44:33.800 --> 44:36.140
Hey!
Hurry!

44:42.180 --> 44:43.350

Captain, come to the autopsy room. Now.

(Autopsy Room)

44:48.130 --> 44:49.350

44:50.220 --> 44:51.720
They were frozen when they were found.

44:51.900 --> 44:54.530
The marks on the back
seem to be from the freezer shelves.

45:01.110 --> 45:02.730
Captain Kook Young Soo found it.

45:12.550 --> 45:16.080
What is it about, sir?
Why can't you just say it?

45:17.280 --> 45:20.650
I know what everyone thinks
about the Analysis Team.

45:20.650 --> 45:22.490
I know what's going on,

45:23.300 --> 45:27.620
but we can give them a chance, you know?

45:28.260 --> 45:30.730
I heard Kook Young Soo was the one
who found the clue.

45:33.800 --> 45:36.010
Captain Yoon, I'm sure you know this,

45:36.010 --> 45:39.200
but it's lonely taking a path
no one has ever taken before.

45:39.470 --> 45:40.880
They must be feeling lonely right now.

45:40.880 --> 45:46.140
So I'd like you to help them.

45:47.510 --> 45:51.320
Don't get me wrong. It's not an order.

45:51.320 --> 45:54.320
Of course not. I'm sure she knows.

45:56.720 --> 45:58.990
Yes, sir. I should get back to work.

45:58.990 --> 46:00.760
Okay, sure.
All right.

46:07.900 --> 46:11.340

46:11.510 --> 46:13.670
We'll check the junk shops
in the area first.

46:13.840 --> 46:17.610
Then we'll check
electronics stores in the area.

46:18.050 --> 46:19.510
Please check everything thoroughly.

46:19.510 --> 46:21.580
Will do. Good luck.

Would you happen to have a fridge
with shelves spaced out this much?

46:45.110 --> 46:46.680
Or did you maybe sell one?

48:02.820 --> 48:05.530
I see. What brings you here then?

48:05.530 --> 48:07.520
We wanted to ask you a question.

48:08.450 --> 48:10.750
This is my go-to song.

for a moment, please?

a particular model for a fridge...

and everything about fridges.

knowledge about fridges in Korea.

Could you maybe tell us
what model this is?

48:57.070 --> 49:00.670
This was a model used in 1980.

49:00.950 --> 49:03.810
That's not a shelf, it's
the interior floor of the fridge.

49:04.280 --> 49:07.610

at the Daesung headquarter.

a five-year-old, Lee Soo Hyun,
was dismembered...

52:47.330 --> 52:50.220
and found in a residential area
in Changeui-dong.

52:50.430 --> 52:53.140
Yesterday on June 26,

52:53.140 --> 52:55.130
an additional part of her body...

52:55.840 --> 52:57.530
was found at a motel in Gyeongseong-dong.

52:57.970 --> 53:01.370

53:01.480 --> 53:05.250

when she found a part of
a young child's remains...

53:08.320 --> 53:09.710
in the toilet of room 302
on the third floor around 3 p.m.

53:09.750 --> 53:11.690
According to Kim,

53:11.690 --> 53:17.520
a man who looked to be in his 40s,
dressed in manual labor clothes...

53:17.730 --> 53:20.190
stayed in this room
around 7 a.m. on the 25th.

53:20.660 --> 53:24.920

this ongoing investigation...

in this investigation...

53:28.140 --> 53:31.600

the culprit's capture.

53:59.270 --> 54:00.890

the identity of the culprit...

Hi.

54:15.180 --> 54:18.410
We need more support staff
for the Investigation Team, Chief.

We've already maxed out the number.
You know that too.

the additional body part was found.

54:25.030 --> 54:26.550
We can't delay any further.

54:26.900 --> 54:29.390

to send out for questioning.

Try using the Behavioral Analysis Team.

54:33.840 --> 54:36.340
Chief...
You said it's urgent.

54:36.340 --> 54:39.070
Try asking for the Analysis Team's help.

54:39.480 --> 54:42.600
Even though their method
may seem foreign...

54:42.750 --> 54:45.750
the team was still made
to work for the organization too.

54:45.750 --> 54:47.740
They're affiliated with
the Detective Division too.

54:49.520 --> 54:52.410
Also, this is off the record...

54:53.320 --> 54:57.050
but the Behavioral Analysis Team
may go away after this year.

54:57.230 --> 54:58.330
What do you mean, "Go away?"

54:58.330 --> 55:01.900
They will have to show results,
in order to show their worth.

55:01.900 --> 55:05.990
Those guys are in as knee-deep
as we are in this case too.

55:06.170 --> 55:07.590
So try utilizing them well.

55:07.770 --> 55:10.430
I'm certain it'll be helpful
for both sides.

55:16.510 --> 55:19.620
The act of the culprit leaving
the mutilated corpse...

55:19.620 --> 55:22.340
in a residential area was likely
because he wanted to show off.

55:22.350 --> 55:24.750
The method of the murder
was so violent and highly advanced.

55:24.750 --> 55:27.420
It's been over a month
since Soo Hyun disappeared.

55:27.420 --> 55:29.450
Yet, the whereabouts
of the culprit is still...

55:31.230 --> 55:34.920
To a profiler, policing doesn't come
before examining the minds.

55:35.200 --> 55:36.800
Examining the minds come first.

55:36.800 --> 55:38.070
(Body parts found: both arms,
both hands, both legs...)

55:38.070 --> 55:42.730
A profiler must detect
what happened at the crime scene.

55:44.740 --> 55:47.770
There's no meaning in keeping
the meeting materials in the team.

55:48.040 --> 55:50.000
Why don't we write up a report...

55:50.180 --> 55:51.900
and share it with the Investigation Team?

55:51.910 --> 55:55.180
So you want to put together
the reasons for our reasoning...

55:55.180 --> 55:57.240
and suggest it to them as a possibility?

55:57.990 --> 55:59.150
Yes.

55:59.320 --> 56:01.220
There's no meaning
in doing this by ourselves.

56:01.220 --> 56:03.620
I'm not sure if she'll be convinced.

56:04.760 --> 56:05.990
We'll have to try.

56:06.660 --> 56:07.820
Shall we?

56:11.430 --> 56:13.530
Profiling Report, Changeui-dong Case.

56:14.600 --> 56:16.160
The body was mutilated
after it was frozen.

56:16.570 --> 56:18.430
A mid to large-sized
fridge for home was used.

56:18.640 --> 56:20.140
The cross-section of the body parts.

56:20.140 --> 56:22.150
The shape and the cross-section show...

56:22.150 --> 56:24.640
the culprit is someone
who cuts frozen food.

56:24.710 --> 56:27.520
All seven black plastic bags
containing the parts were clean.

56:27.520 --> 56:29.310
Two plastic bags were used
to pack the body parts.

56:29.890 --> 56:30.980
Goodness.

56:31.950 --> 56:33.420
When people sell frozen products,

56:33.420 --> 56:36.750
they have a habit of wrapping them
in two plastic bags.

56:37.090 --> 56:39.550
The culprit likely has
a history of selling frozen food...

56:40.060 --> 56:41.650
or is currently working...

56:41.830 --> 56:44.290
at a butcher's shop or at a fish shop.

56:44.670 --> 56:46.390
The time elapsed
while mutilating the body.

56:47.940 --> 56:49.900
It means he took time to cut her body.

56:50.670 --> 56:52.700
If he cut her after freezing her body,

56:52.910 --> 56:55.130
it means he spent
a lot of time mutilating her.

56:56.950 --> 56:58.840
The culprit either lives alone...

56:59.280 --> 57:01.010
or works alone.

57:01.950 --> 57:03.790
It would've been too dangerous...

57:03.790 --> 57:05.480
to travel far with a little child.

57:05.890 --> 57:08.780
In conclusion, the culprit is
a man who lives alone,

57:09.060 --> 57:10.880
but someone who likes
to keep things clean.

57:11.490 --> 57:14.090
If you search his house,
it will be neatly organized.

57:14.160 --> 57:17.090
The weapon he used will
also be put away neatly.

57:17.270 --> 57:18.800
The crime site and his residence...

57:18.800 --> 57:21.070
may be within the walking distance...

57:21.070 --> 57:23.070
between the point she went missing
to the victim's home.

57:23.070 --> 57:25.780
Abduction, sexual molestation, mutilation,

57:25.780 --> 57:27.330
and abandonment show...

57:27.510 --> 57:30.770
the culprit's age is
between the late 30s to early 40s.

57:31.450 --> 57:33.110
His final education is presumed...

57:33.420 --> 57:35.170
as a middle school dropout
or a middle school graduate.

57:35.720 --> 57:37.150
It may be a person...

57:37.150 --> 57:39.320
who has experience in selling
frozen foods such as a butcher,

57:39.320 --> 57:41.250
or a person who does cutting-related work,

57:41.620 --> 57:43.060
someone who does not work
in one place for a long time...

57:43.060 --> 57:44.580
and changes jobs frequently.

57:44.930 --> 57:46.900
He may currently run a butcher shop,
a raw fish restaurant,

57:46.900 --> 57:48.750
or another restaurant alone.

57:49.170 --> 57:52.790
"If someone abducted a minor
for sexual purposes,"

57:53.040 --> 57:54.900
"he may show characteristics..."

57:54.900 --> 57:57.010
"that are common to culprits
of child rape and murder."

57:57.010 --> 57:59.210
"He may be an introvert, reserved,"

57:59.210 --> 58:03.100
"and have a sexual complex."

58:03.150 --> 58:05.640
"Premature ejaculation or impotence?"

58:05.720 --> 58:07.410
How are we going to confirm that?

58:07.620 --> 58:10.150
So in summary,

58:10.150 --> 58:13.820
a man with a sexual complex
who lives alone...

58:13.820 --> 58:16.520
and likes things neat is
probably the culprit. Yes?

58:16.960 --> 58:19.430
Yes, sir.
What is this nonsense?

58:19.430 --> 58:21.100
The victim was abducted at a place...

58:21.100 --> 58:23.890
difficult to find for those
who aren't familiar with the area.

58:24.100 --> 58:26.400
Also, it probably wasn't easy
to take the victim far away...

58:26.400 --> 58:28.430
as she cried and fought back.

58:28.910 --> 58:30.900
These two things tell us that...

58:31.110 --> 58:33.210
the crime site and his residence...

58:33.210 --> 58:35.500
may be within the walking distance
from where she went missing.

58:36.780 --> 58:39.910
He's the most likely to reside
somewhere in that area.

58:40.050 --> 58:43.480
We already searched through
the entire neighborhood.

58:43.990 --> 58:45.710
We did not find anything suspicious.

58:46.360 --> 58:49.290
The same goes for the butcher shop.
We already investigated.

58:49.290 --> 58:53.220
Yes, we did not just sit around.

58:53.530 --> 58:55.530
Then he must have worked
at a butcher shop in the past.

58:55.530 --> 58:57.230
He'll be someone who does not work
in one place for a long time...

58:57.230 --> 58:59.100
and changes jobs frequently.

58:59.100 --> 59:00.590
If that's your theory,

59:01.470 --> 59:03.810
is it possible that the culprit
can be someone...

59:03.810 --> 59:06.170
who takes night shifts
at a raw fish restaurant?

59:06.280 --> 59:07.540
It's very likely.

59:07.540 --> 59:10.650
This sounds too vague.

59:10.650 --> 59:11.910
Look at this in the middle.

59:11.910 --> 59:13.520
"Abduction, sexual molestation,"

59:13.520 --> 59:15.820
"mutilation, and abandonment show..."

59:15.820 --> 59:18.890
"the culprit's age is
between the late 30s to early 40s."

59:18.890 --> 59:20.790
"His final education is presumed..."

59:20.790 --> 59:22.520
"as a middle school dropout
or a middle school graduate."

59:22.760 --> 59:23.930
If he has a criminal record,

59:23.930 --> 59:25.760
he may have a record
for a crime such as theft...

59:25.760 --> 59:27.490
rather than violence or injury
against a person,

59:27.660 --> 59:29.230
then became punished...

59:29.230 --> 59:31.320
when he was in middle and high school.

59:32.170 --> 59:35.460
I mean, what's your ground?

59:35.640 --> 59:38.440
Our ground is the FBI's crime analysis...

59:38.440 --> 59:41.080
Good grief, you're bringing up
those Americans again.

59:41.080 --> 59:43.550
Hey, you're in Korea,

59:43.550 --> 59:46.840
where the World Cup will happen
in just two years.

59:48.050 --> 59:51.220
Also, he threw out
the body parts he cut up...

59:51.220 --> 59:53.720
around the neighborhood
as if he put them on display,

59:53.720 --> 59:55.590
yet you're saying
he's not a smart criminal?

59:55.590 --> 59:56.790
It may look like he put them on display,

59:56.790 --> 59:58.680
but the biggest reason
why he cut her body was...

59:59.030 --> 01:00:00.850
that he did not want her to be noticed.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:04.320
Also, the culprit threw those out
in many different areas.

01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:06.770
It's almost like
that personality type test.

01:00:06.770 --> 01:00:09.640
"Blood type B has
a feisty and selfish personality."

01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:11.500
Isn't it something like that?

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:15.230
I think I trust the blood type
personality theory even more.

01:00:15.380 --> 01:00:16.380
What are you...

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:19.040
Here's one I find the most convincing.

01:00:19.220 --> 01:00:21.540
"He may have a sexual complex."

01:00:21.650 --> 01:00:24.310
"He either worked
around the crime scene..."

01:00:24.420 --> 01:00:25.690
"or resided there."

01:00:25.690 --> 01:00:28.850
"He's someone who does not have
many close friends."

01:00:30.330 --> 01:00:32.700
Most sex offenders are introverted...

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.430
and have a sexual complex.

01:00:34.430 --> 01:00:36.660
If he targeted a minor
instead of a grown woman,

01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:38.430
it means he wanted to find...

01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:40.260
an easy target who wouldn't fight him.

01:00:41.570 --> 01:00:43.830
We must start investigating
sex offenders...

01:00:44.010 --> 01:00:45.510
who committed a crime against minors.

01:00:45.510 --> 01:00:47.630
My gosh.

01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:50.200
Chief Heo.

01:00:51.250 --> 01:00:52.440
It can't happen, can it?

01:00:54.020 --> 01:00:55.570
No, we can't do this.

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:57.620
We have pride
here at the Special Crime Squad.

01:00:57.620 --> 01:01:00.410
How can I give them an order
to investigate by using this report?

01:01:00.820 --> 01:01:01.950
Gil Pyo.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.260
Chief Heo. You have nothing to lose.

01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:06.860
The least you can do is investigate.

01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:08.900
No, we can't do that.

01:01:08.900 --> 01:01:12.600
If we must investigate
every single ex-con,

01:01:12.600 --> 01:01:14.840
we'll need a lot of manpower too.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.100
Don't you think so?

01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.530
Here's what I'm trying to say.

01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:27.210
I think it'll be impossible
if we try to do this officially.

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:33.410
(Unofficial)

01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.520
Just do it unofficially.

01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:45.220
Let's end the meeting.

If they help our investigation,

01:01:55.850 --> 01:01:57.800
we won't lose anything either.

so you have to move quietly.

with the list of sex offenders,

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:23.890
why don't we try to find...

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:53.890
Please give me a list...

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:56.350
of men in their 30s and 40s
who live alone in Changeui-dong.

01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:58.180
Everyone?

01:04:58.260 --> 01:05:00.150
(Changeui-dong Single-person homes
for men in their 30s and 40s)

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:02.020
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:08.760
Take a look at that one.

01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:13.030
Captain Yoon.

01:05:13.810 --> 01:05:15.170
You need to see this.

01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:17.910
These four weren't found
on the criminal records database...

01:05:17.910 --> 01:05:19.740
at the police agency.

01:05:19.850 --> 01:05:21.450
They registered their move later,

01:05:21.450 --> 01:05:22.810
so they weren't caught on the system.

01:05:24.190 --> 01:05:25.720
So there were those who got left out.

01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.610
Yes, we might end up
catching the culprit easily.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.290
Captain Kook.

01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.720
We need to talk.

01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:40.790
The 4 of us will check out 1 address each.

01:05:58.090 --> 01:05:59.850
(Criminal History Record)

01:06:01.360 --> 01:06:03.350
Changeui-dong...

01:06:06.830 --> 01:06:11.190
(39-1 Changeui-dong)

01:06:55.210 --> 01:06:58.070
The items are somewhat neatly organized.

01:07:11.490 --> 01:07:13.500
The house is close to the alley
in Changeui-dong...

01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:15.490
where the body parts were first found.

01:07:31.250 --> 01:07:32.670
I think I found the place.

01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:35.270
Wait for me.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.080
(Item Storage)

01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:05.500
(Employment,
factories and construction sites)

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.670
This guy is the culprit.

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:15.650
(Through the Darkness)

01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:48.060
I'm sure we'll find Soo Hyun's
fingers around his house.

01:08:48.060 --> 01:08:49.060
There are only eight fingers.

01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:51.359
We're missing two fingers of a girl!

01:08:51.359 --> 01:08:53.029
Search thoroughly!

01:08:53.029 --> 01:08:54.029
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.

01:08:54.029 --> 01:08:55.660
The two fingers we couldn't find...

01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:56.729
Where are they?

01:08:56.729 --> 01:08:58.029
There are three fingerprints?

01:08:58.029 --> 01:08:59.430
It's odd that there are
only three fingerprints, right?

01:08:59.430 --> 01:09:01.300
He either has a weird grip...

01:09:01.300 --> 01:09:02.370
or is missing fingers.

01:09:02.370 --> 01:09:03.840
He abandoned her body parts...

01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:05.310
at different times in different locations.

01:09:05.310 --> 01:09:08.029
Cho Young Gil...
Where is he hiding?
