[Bruce] Maria, my sweet comedy warrior.

00:08.051 --> 00:09.385
How would you like to make...

00:09.469 --> 00:11.971
a whole shitload of money
together with me?

00:12.055 --> 00:14.349
Uh, sure! That sounds good.

00:14.432 --> 00:15.767
Let's talk merchandising.

00:15.850 --> 00:19.020
How much money would you guess
that Andy Kindler made

00:19.103 --> 00:21.481
on his concert t-shirts this past year?

00:21.564 --> 00:23.149
$13,000.

00:23.233 --> 00:25.193
That's right.
How the heck did you get that?

00:25.276 --> 00:27.362
I think about money a lot.

00:27.445 --> 00:29.239
Yeah. Me, too.

00:29.948 --> 00:32.158
So, picture this...

00:32.241 --> 00:35.370
You on the t-shirt.
And then, in big pink letters,

00:35.453 --> 00:37.956
"Maria Bamford! Bam! Bam!"

00:38.039 --> 00:39.374
Well, I give you--

00:39.457 --> 00:42.585
Bruce, look.
I need and love money, but...

00:42.669 --> 00:44.837
if someone held a gun to my head
and said I had to sell t-shirts,

00:44.921 --> 00:48.633
I would rather have my brains...
splattered against this wall.

00:49.801 --> 00:52.136
-I'm not into it.
-[softly] Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

00:52.220 --> 00:54.722
-I understand completely. So noted.
-[cell phone chiming]

00:54.806 --> 00:57.308
Bruce, I'm sorry, I have to get this.
Do you mind?

00:57.392 --> 00:59.477
That's fine. Take your time, my sweet.

00:59.561 --> 01:01.521
I just-- I met this guy.

01:01.604 --> 01:04.274
I really like him. And he really likes me.

01:04.357 --> 01:08.069
Bruce, have you ever met someone
and you had sex with them right away,

01:08.152 --> 01:10.863
and then they wanna have
a real relationship?

01:10.947 --> 01:14.325
You know, what if they find out about...
who I really am,

01:14.409 --> 01:16.619
and then they... run for the hills?

01:16.703 --> 01:18.997
Sex has never been easy for me.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.124
I don't know what it is.
It physically clamps up,

01:21.207 --> 01:24.085
and it's psychological,
physiological, I don't know.

01:24.168 --> 01:25.962
But, with Scott...

01:26.045 --> 01:27.338
he got it in there.

01:27.422 --> 01:29.882
Did I remember to tell you
that you're gonna be playing

01:29.966 --> 01:32.969
Flappers Comedy
and Korean Bowling Barbecue on the 7th?

01:33.052 --> 01:34.595
That... is what I should do.

01:34.679 --> 01:36.597
I should have him go see my stand-up.

01:36.681 --> 01:40.768
That way he sees all my garbage.
He'll know all my faults, all my demons.

01:40.852 --> 01:42.687
Pull the Band-Aid off, and then...

01:42.770 --> 01:45.857
he can leave, and...
I can just find somebody else

01:45.940 --> 01:47.984
who I like maybe a little less,

01:48.109 --> 01:50.862
but it's... less scary.

01:50.945 --> 01:52.405
This has been fascinating.

01:52.488 --> 01:53.823
-You know, a journal...
-Yeah?

01:53.906 --> 01:56.993
...is a great place for private thoughts.

01:57.076 --> 01:59.078

02:08.963 --> 02:09.964
[Maria scatting]

02:12.091 --> 02:13.718
[audience chuckling]

02:13.801 --> 02:15.970
[Maria] You ever had a creepy thought,

02:16.054 --> 02:18.890
like, [gasping]
"Oh, what if I licked a urinal?

02:18.973 --> 02:21.684
Oh, God,
I can't believe I just thought that.

02:21.768 --> 02:22.852
Oh, God!

02:22.935 --> 02:25.772
[gasping] I should probably do
a complicated dance step

02:25.855 --> 02:27.482
and clench my fists
at odd intervals,

02:27.565 --> 02:31.069
just in case I fell over
and, by accident, I licked it."

02:31.152 --> 02:32.403
[audience laughing]

02:32.487 --> 02:36.741
That is a type of OCD and the great thing
is that you get to go to therapy

02:36.824 --> 02:40.286
and you get to hear
what other people are worried about...

02:40.370 --> 02:44.123
"Maria, have you ever avoided
going to a religious institution,

02:44.207 --> 02:46.709
'cause you were worried that
you would lose control,

02:46.793 --> 02:50.421
run up on the altar, take a shit,
and yell, 'I am a promise keeper'?"

02:51.297 --> 02:53.216
No. I mean, that seems reasonable, but...

02:53.299 --> 02:55.551
[inhales sharply] "Okay, have you ever...

02:55.635 --> 02:58.054
not wanted to be left alone at SeaWorld,

02:58.137 --> 03:00.181
'cause you worry
you'd go to the tide pool,

03:00.264 --> 03:02.934
take a baby starfish
and try to kiss its poop hole?"

03:03.017 --> 03:04.727
[audience laughing]

03:04.811 --> 03:08.856
"Okay, have you ever not wanted
to spend time with friends or family,

03:08.940 --> 03:11.526
'cause you were worried you're gonna
chop them up into chunks and bits,

03:11.609 --> 03:13.528
have sex with the chunks and bits,

03:13.611 --> 03:16.823
put the chunks and bits in a Cobb salad
and feed it to others?"

03:18.199 --> 03:19.826
[scoffs]

03:19.909 --> 03:21.285
-Yes.
-[audience laughing]

03:21.369 --> 03:22.787
[scoffing]

03:22.870 --> 03:25.498
Anyways, thank you guys.
Thanks for listening.

03:25.581 --> 03:26.707
-[applauding]
-Okay.

03:26.791 --> 03:27.959
That was great.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.419
Oh, thanks, I...

03:29.502 --> 03:31.254
So, I'll pick up my stuff tomorrow.

03:31.337 --> 03:33.172
My sweatshirt and my LaserDiscs.

03:33.256 --> 03:36.092
So, anyways, I'm a monster.
Great getting to know you,

03:36.175 --> 03:37.927
and... I bid you good eve.

03:38.010 --> 03:39.387
Wait. Why are you leaving?

03:39.470 --> 03:42.390
Because I have showed you
the horrors of my mind

03:42.473 --> 03:45.601
and, thusly, I don't blame you,
but you are terrified,

03:45.685 --> 03:46.769
and need to run for the hills.

03:46.853 --> 03:48.980
No, uh-uh, Maria.
I'm not leaving you.

03:49.105 --> 03:51.065
But what about the horr-ars?

03:51.149 --> 03:52.859
Especially after the horr-ars.

03:52.942 --> 03:54.777
It's gonna sound strange,

03:54.861 --> 03:57.280
but I like you even better
now that I know you've got...

03:57.363 --> 04:00.950
fantasies about choppin' up your family
and having sex with their pieces.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.911
[sighing and scoffing] What?

04:03.995 --> 04:05.788
I mean, it's no backwards smoker.

04:07.373 --> 04:08.583
[inhaling]

04:08.666 --> 04:10.501
-[exhaling]
-Okay, what is that?

04:11.210 --> 04:13.296
-Smoking backwards.
-Am I doin' it?

04:13.379 --> 04:15.298
Yeah, you're doin' it perfectly.

04:15.381 --> 04:16.298
Oh, thank you.

04:16.382 --> 04:17.507
I wanted to show you something.

04:17.591 --> 04:21.095
While you were sleeping the other night,
I did a bit of sketching.

04:22.263 --> 04:23.806
Of my... nuditity?

04:23.890 --> 04:25.516
No, no, it's...

04:25.600 --> 04:27.059
It's all Bert.

04:27.143 --> 04:29.312
[gasping] Oh, my God.

04:29.395 --> 04:31.022
It's Bert and some Blueberry.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.858
[Maria] That's Bert
signing the Magna Carta!

04:34.859 --> 04:37.320
Bert and Blueberry
in the <i>Thelma & Louise</i> car.

04:37.403 --> 04:38.863
Of course, Blueberry's driving.

04:39.906 --> 04:43.034
Bert and Blueberry
in that TV show <i>Melissa & Joey.</i>

04:43.117 --> 04:45.328
That is Bert's favorite show,

04:45.411 --> 04:48.539
and he is mostly alone with that,
except for most of America.

04:49.207 --> 04:50.416
These are gorgeous.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.001
If you're cool with it...

04:52.084 --> 04:54.921
I'd love to do
a bunch of sketches of you...

04:55.004 --> 04:56.297
choppin' up your family.

04:56.380 --> 04:58.090
Maybe with charcoal.

04:58.174 --> 05:01.594
I would love that--
I mean... are you sure?

05:01.677 --> 05:04.514
Just because I--
I'm on a ton of medications.

05:04.597 --> 05:07.308
I have a not-light tremor.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.435
I don't know
if you're ready for this jelly.

05:10.436 --> 05:11.813
I think I'm ready for this jelly.

05:11.896 --> 05:15.733
You know what? My grandma,
when she went to the psych ward,

05:15.817 --> 05:18.236
she grew, like, a small beard.

05:19.237 --> 05:21.322
-Do you do that?
-What do you think?

05:22.615 --> 05:23.699
Yes, I did.

05:23.783 --> 05:25.701
I'd shave your beard.

05:25.785 --> 05:27.578
That is possibly the most romantic thing

05:27.662 --> 05:30.164
-that has ever been said to me.
-[both laughing]

05:30.957 --> 05:32.458
Hey, I've--

05:32.542 --> 05:34.418
I've never asked a human this question.

05:35.211 --> 05:38.965
Would you like to go
on a nature walk with me tomorrow?

05:39.048 --> 05:40.800
-I'd like that.
-[chuckling] Okay.

05:41.717 --> 05:43.052
Well, it'll be awesome.

05:43.135 --> 05:45.721
-Well... Well...
-[grunting] Oh.

05:45.805 --> 05:48.599
[Chantrelle]
Celebriteasers, celebrity look-alikes.

05:48.683 --> 05:51.060
No, we're only seeing
Captain Jack Sparrows today.

05:52.186 --> 05:56.649
So, am I to understand that we are
now well rid of those shirts of tee?

05:56.732 --> 06:00.820
Oh, yeah. They'll be in South Sudan
by tomorrow night.

06:00.903 --> 06:02.989
Even though I'm sick
of all things nautical,

06:03.072 --> 06:05.866
that seems treacherously fast
for a cargo vessel.

06:06.701 --> 06:09.161
Girl, you said to get them out of here,

06:09.245 --> 06:12.373
and I quote, "ASPCA!"

06:12.456 --> 06:14.041
So I overnighted them.

06:14.125 --> 06:17.169
And, how much, pray tell,
is that going to cost?

06:17.253 --> 06:19.463
-$32,000.
-Huh.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.674
-[hyperventilating]
-Are you all right?

06:21.757 --> 06:23.551
I'm kinda falling apart, I'm...

06:23.634 --> 06:26.262
I'm broke.
I'm actually, sort of, finished.

06:26.345 --> 06:28.180
Please hold all my calls, okay?

06:28.264 --> 06:30.516
I'm about to shed this mortal coil.

06:30.600 --> 06:31.809
Excuse me.

06:35.229 --> 06:40.943
[muffled screaming] Barbara! Oh, God!

06:41.027 --> 06:42.945
I'll cancel your lunch.

06:57.168 --> 06:59.378
[in Swahili] Look at this.

06:59.462 --> 07:01.964
That's a reference to comic
Maria Bamford.

07:02.048 --> 07:03.924
I saw her on Netflix.

07:04.008 --> 07:07.386
[chuckles] She works really hard to
destigmatize mental illness.

07:07.470 --> 07:08.471
Really brave.

07:08.554 --> 07:10.014
I don't know her.

07:10.097 --> 07:11.849
I'm more of
a Natasha Leggero guy.

07:11.933 --> 07:14.101
Look, I love Natasha Leggero.

07:14.185 --> 07:16.187
But you can't possibly put her
on the same level as Bamford.

07:16.312 --> 07:17.688
It's apples and oranges.

07:17.772 --> 07:19.231
Don't be a dick, Ron.

07:19.315 --> 07:20.900
You're the one being a dick.

07:20.983 --> 07:22.860
-You're a dick.
-Dick.

07:22.944 --> 07:23.986
[in English] Ron. Don't.

07:24.070 --> 07:25.196
[in Swahili] Dick.

07:25.279 --> 07:26.781
[in English] Don't.

07:28.532 --> 07:30.409
[Karen] Suck your own cock for me, okay?

07:30.493 --> 07:32.244
I love ya. News flash.

07:32.328 --> 07:35.122
The Pepper Stepper Pepper-bot
is selling like whore-flavored hot cakes.

07:35.206 --> 07:36.624
We've already sold four in Singapore.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.125
Bachelor party. Don't ask.

07:38.209 --> 07:40.086
That's $11 in your pocket.

07:40.169 --> 07:43.714
Next item.
Who is the biggest TV star today?

07:43.798 --> 07:45.424
-Charlie Sheen.
-[mimics buzzer] Wrong!

07:45.508 --> 07:46.884
It's Wendie Malick.

<i>-♪ Ch-- Check out these titties! ♪</i>
-Whoa.

Ten words...

07:58.312 --> 08:03.317
Wendie Malick Pitchapalooza, sponsored
by a major national sandwich chain,

08:03.401 --> 08:04.777
unnamed due to legal reasons.

08:04.860 --> 08:06.237
Here's how it works...

08:06.320 --> 08:08.406
Wendie Malick gives us an hour of her time

08:08.489 --> 08:10.032
at an undisclosed location

08:10.116 --> 08:11.325
Wendie Malick will hear pitches.

08:11.409 --> 08:14.245
The winner will be taken
to a major television network

08:14.328 --> 08:16.747
to pitch the winning show
with Wendie Malick.

08:16.831 --> 08:18.624
-[gasping]
-It will be a huge hit.

08:18.708 --> 08:21.585
The winner will buy
a motherfucking Maui vacation home

08:21.669 --> 08:23.754
with the syndication profits, okay? Boom!

08:23.838 --> 08:26.549
-[gasping and laughing]
-That is the power of Malick.

08:26.632 --> 08:28.551
Maria, I want you to Pitchapalooza.

08:28.634 --> 08:30.136
Okay, I'm not a writer.

08:30.219 --> 08:31.637
-Neither was Shakespeare.
-Okay.

08:31.721 --> 08:33.054
He was a handjobbing hobo.

08:33.139 --> 08:35.765
Mary Shelley wrote <i>Frankenstein</i> on a dare.

08:35.850 --> 08:39.270
So I double dare you to take yourself
out of your comfort zone.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.688
And I don't wanna give you
an unfair advantage,

08:41.772 --> 08:44.442
but since I represent both you and Malick,

08:44.525 --> 08:45.860
I will tell you this.

08:45.943 --> 08:48.154
-She is a major fucking Bamhead.
-[gasping]

08:48.237 --> 08:50.031
I'm getting that out there.
Get used to it.

08:50.114 --> 08:51.907
-How many people are pitching?
-Forty-seven.

08:51.991 --> 08:54.368
That's a lot in one hour.
That's-- It's so fast.

08:54.452 --> 08:55.661
If you know what you're talking about,

08:55.745 --> 08:57.621
you can explain any hit show
in three words.

08:57.705 --> 09:00.166
They sold <i>Friends</i> with three words...

09:00.249 --> 09:04.211
Whiny, coffee, Jews.<i> Friends,</i> okay?

09:04.295 --> 09:06.672
This is leg number two
of the three-legged stool

09:06.756 --> 09:10.259
of your success machine.
Are you ready to sit hard on your stool?

09:10.342 --> 09:12.845
Yes! I am. I am so filled with energy!

09:12.928 --> 09:15.056
I could take your desk and throw it--

09:15.139 --> 09:16.557
I love that. But please don't,

09:16.640 --> 09:18.934
because I'll have to call security
to have you escorted out, okay?

09:19.018 --> 09:20.478
Now, get the fuck out of my office.

09:20.561 --> 09:23.064
-Okay.
-And I want you to give the world

09:23.147 --> 09:26.525
a hit fucking sandwich-oriented show!
Go!

09:27.485 --> 09:31.113
Fade in, interior hospital,
our star, Wendie Subs,

09:31.197 --> 09:33.824
as played by Wendie Malick.

09:33.908 --> 09:36.410
Crime, punishment, commercial--

09:36.494 --> 09:38.496
Buick commercial. "That's not a Buick."

09:38.579 --> 09:40.331
Find out later, it is a Buick.

09:40.414 --> 09:44.418
Side note, check real estate listings
in Maui with Buick money. [screaming]

09:44.502 --> 09:46.754
-Hey, Graham!
-How you doin', Maria?

09:46.837 --> 09:50.299
Oh! I am just tearing the cover
off the ball in there. With writing.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.843
They said Aaron Sorkin writes this way.

09:52.927 --> 09:56.597
And he is a major star of writing.

09:57.306 --> 09:59.350
Well, how was your day of stuntmanning?

09:59.433 --> 10:00.684
-Not great. [groaning]
-Okay.

10:00.768 --> 10:03.062
-I twisted my ankle... again.
-Oh...

10:03.187 --> 10:05.981
They wouldn't let me crash my car
through the fruit stand.

10:06.065 --> 10:08.818
I have an idea. Let's write together!

10:08.901 --> 10:10.069
I'm not a writer.

10:10.152 --> 10:11.070
We have to write together.

10:11.153 --> 10:13.114
We've moved in together far too early.

10:13.197 --> 10:14.698
We got engaged instead of breaking up.

10:14.782 --> 10:18.994
We have obliterated every natural boundary
in a relationship.

10:19.078 --> 10:20.955
Writing together is the next natural step.

10:21.038 --> 10:23.415
I love your energy. I do.

10:23.499 --> 10:24.708
I love your everything!

10:24.792 --> 10:26.335
-Ow. Ow!
-Oh, God! [chuckling]

10:26.418 --> 10:27.878
-[groaning]
-Malick!

10:27.962 --> 10:31.715
It's a children's musical,
but it's also a screenplay with puppets.

10:31.799 --> 10:33.759
And woodworking!

10:33.843 --> 10:35.886
Beat the wood with a club.

10:35.970 --> 10:37.555
Club sandwich! Everyone loves bowling.

10:37.638 --> 10:39.932
Bowl three strikes. That's a turkey!

10:40.015 --> 10:41.517
[shrieking] That's a turkey!

10:41.600 --> 10:44.812
[laughing] Pigs.
Pigs driving a car filled with bacon.

10:44.937 --> 10:46.689
Tragic irony! [moaning]

10:46.772 --> 10:49.400
Bacon, turkey, club.
Three words. I got it.

10:49.483 --> 10:52.194
[laughing]
Thank you for doing this, Maria.

10:52.278 --> 10:53.696
For doing what?

10:53.779 --> 10:55.948
For clowning around like this
and cheerin' me up.

10:56.031 --> 10:58.284
It's exactly what I need
after the day I've had.

10:58.367 --> 10:59.535
-Okay.
-I just found out

10:59.618 --> 11:02.204
Lauren wants full custody of the kids.

11:02.288 --> 11:03.247
Oh.

11:03.330 --> 11:06.208
Children. [stuttering] Custody. Custard.

11:06.292 --> 11:07.418
Custard cakes!

11:07.501 --> 11:10.796
Then all the injuries.
And my ankle... again.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.382
All these young guys
are stealing my crashes.

11:13.465 --> 11:15.718
I'm getting scared that I'm too old
for this.

11:15.801 --> 11:17.720
And it's bumming me out, big time.

11:17.803 --> 11:21.557
I've never told anybody this,
but depression runs in my family.

11:21.640 --> 11:24.852
I guess I've always outrun it
by trying to stay super active,

11:24.935 --> 11:27.605
and everything's, sort of,
keepin' the sadness at bay.

11:27.688 --> 11:30.858
[gasping] Bay-oncé and Jay Z!

11:30.941 --> 11:32.109
Hava!

11:32.192 --> 11:34.528
My mom tried to kill herself
when I was seven.

11:35.821 --> 11:37.531
[chuckling] Jesus Christ,
I've never told anybody that.

11:37.615 --> 11:39.158
I never... [stuttering]

11:39.241 --> 11:40.993
God, I feel so safe with you.

11:41.076 --> 11:42.286
[softly] Oh, is it--

11:42.369 --> 11:44.955
That's why I'm drawn
to people like you, Maria.

11:45.039 --> 11:46.665
You're always up and full of energy.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.000
That's me! Up, up and away!

11:48.083 --> 11:49.585
Get out of my way, I gotta get up!

11:49.668 --> 11:50.753
-Gotta go...
-[groaning]

11:50.836 --> 11:52.004
I'll be back in a second.

11:52.087 --> 11:54.673
[muffled crying]

11:59.803 --> 12:01.972
[mumbling]

12:04.850 --> 12:05.851
-Put this on.
-[Maria] Oh.

12:05.935 --> 12:08.437
It'll vibrate when Miss Malick
is ready for you.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.522
You have 20 seconds
to approach Ms. Malick,

12:10.606 --> 12:11.982
then 60 seconds to pitch.

12:12.066 --> 12:13.943
After 60 seconds,
this necklace will act as a Taser.

12:14.026 --> 12:16.236
Okay. Thank you so much, I appreciated it.

12:16.320 --> 12:17.446
[Karen] Maria!

12:17.529 --> 12:19.573
Ready to Ma-lick the competition,
you glorious bitch?

12:19.657 --> 12:22.409
Gonna make these losers Ma-lick
your beautiful stank pipe?

12:22.493 --> 12:24.662
I should be a writer. I really should.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.080
I mean, I could never do what you do.

12:26.163 --> 12:29.583
You're a goddamn magician.
You are the fucking best.

12:29.667 --> 12:31.043
There are a lot of people here.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.295
These assholes?
They're all pieces of shit.

12:33.379 --> 12:34.421
You're pieces of shit!

12:34.505 --> 12:35.881
Don't worry about it,
they're all my best friends.

12:35.965 --> 12:37.424
-It's fine. Hey, Garry.
-Okay.

12:37.508 --> 12:39.718
I just blew him in the bathroom.

12:39.802 --> 12:41.971
No big deal. He may
have directed <i>Pretty Woman.</i>

12:42.054 --> 12:43.597
What a fucking hack.

12:43.681 --> 12:44.682
What's the matter with you?

12:44.765 --> 12:46.767
You look nervous.
Wanna blow someone for luck?

12:46.850 --> 12:49.436
-Garry, get your balls back over here.
-[announcer over PA] <i>Maria Bamford.</i>

12:49.520 --> 12:50.688
-Okay.
-Listen to me.

12:50.771 --> 12:51.689
Sixty seconds, three words.

12:51.772 --> 12:52.982
Pitchapalooza. Let's do this.

12:53.065 --> 12:54.775
Okay. [panting]

12:54.858 --> 12:55.985
Turkey, bacon, club.

12:56.068 --> 12:57.403
Jews, coffee, <i>Friends,</i> whiny.

12:57.486 --> 12:59.029
Turkey, bacon, club.

12:59.113 --> 13:02.783
[announcer] <i>Maria Bamford,</i>
<i>You have one minute to pitch.</i>

13:02.866 --> 13:04.535
<i>You need help, Maria.</i>

13:05.411 --> 13:08.205
<i>You're fine.</i>
<i>Don't listen to that tired old heeb!</i>

13:08.288 --> 13:11.000
<i>I had a rolling brown-out</i>
<i>in those slacks</i>

13:11.083 --> 13:14.461
<i>at Ron Popeil's</i>
<i>July 4th ceviche bar.</i>

13:14.545 --> 13:18.173
<i>Honey, can you be a dear and buy</i>
<i>17 cases of Monistat for me, please?</i>

13:18.257 --> 13:20.884
<i>Maria, your entire act</i>
<i>is based on you being a victim.</i>

13:20.968 --> 13:22.553
<i>And you stole it all from me.</i>

13:22.636 --> 13:25.389
-[Trabajito] <i>Trabajito's always watching.</i>
<i>-Maria!</i>

13:25.472 --> 13:26.890
<i>-Please.</i>
<i>-Mine!</i>

13:26.974 --> 13:29.018
[overlapping chatter]

13:30.561 --> 13:32.730
<i>Feels right! Sounds good! Feels right!</i>

13:32.813 --> 13:34.106
[exploding]

13:35.566 --> 13:37.234
[yelling] Turkey, bacon, club!

13:37.317 --> 13:39.069
-[gasping]
-Hey, hey.

13:39.153 --> 13:41.488
I-- I think you might need
to talk to someone.

13:41.572 --> 13:44.366
[softly] I think you might be right,
Wendie Malick.

13:44.450 --> 13:46.452
I think I might need some help.

13:49.371 --> 13:50.748
[whispering] Turkey, bacon, club.

13:50.831 --> 13:54.460
<i>Ending up in Wendie Malick's tan,</i>
<i>toned arms was not my proudest moment.</i>

13:54.543 --> 13:56.920
<i>But now, I found a guy</i>
<i>who likes me despite my mentals.</i>

13:57.838 --> 13:59.631
In college, I shaved my head.

13:59.715 --> 14:02.176
And I would only wear clothes
that I found on the street.

14:02.259 --> 14:04.803
[Scott] Oh, that's cool. I hate shopping.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.181
I get most of my clothes at gas stations.

14:07.264 --> 14:09.433
God, this is so freeing.
It's, like...

14:09.516 --> 14:12.102
I feel like you're the first guy
I could share everything with.

14:12.186 --> 14:13.687
My childhood was crazy, too.

14:13.771 --> 14:15.564
My dad used to chase us with knives.

14:15.647 --> 14:16.482
What?

14:16.565 --> 14:19.151
Sometimes he'd wake us up
for school with knives.

14:19.234 --> 14:21.236
He'd stab you awake?

14:21.320 --> 14:23.989
No, just the pillows.
But if you moved, you'd get it.

14:24.448 --> 14:26.283
Haven't you noticed
I don't move when I sleep?

14:26.367 --> 14:28.035
I thought you were at peace.

14:28.118 --> 14:29.203
Sometimes he'd ask us,

14:29.286 --> 14:30.704
"Hey, who wants to get
a knife thrown at them?"

14:30.788 --> 14:32.206
It didn't matter what the answer was,

14:32.289 --> 14:33.457
he'd throw them anyway.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.042
We experimented with saying, "Me!"

14:35.125 --> 14:37.378
Any way we answered, the knives would fly.

14:37.461 --> 14:38.796
[gasping and sniffling]

14:38.879 --> 14:41.507
Okay. I might need to... take a second.

14:41.590 --> 14:43.717
-[breathing heavily]
-Are you okay?

14:43.801 --> 14:46.303
I really don't like knives. I-- [sighing]

14:46.387 --> 14:48.514
I suspect it must be some past life thing.

14:48.597 --> 14:50.307
[chuckles nervously]

14:50.391 --> 14:52.309
-Know who else doesn't like knives?
-Who?

14:52.393 --> 14:54.978
My brother, Dave. He took one
in the neck in grade school. Just...

14:55.062 --> 14:58.565
[mimicking blood splattering] ...bled
all over my lunch box and my sandwich.

14:58.649 --> 15:00.442
[chuckling and shuddering]

15:01.777 --> 15:03.278
[distorted] You okay?

15:05.280 --> 15:07.241
[yelling] Knife feelings!

15:10.202 --> 15:11.745
Maria?

15:11.829 --> 15:12.996
[Bruce] Well, actually,

15:13.080 --> 15:15.916
that snare drum has a great deal
of sentimental value.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.294
It was given to me by the lead singer
of Two Ps L, Pure Prairie League,

15:19.378 --> 15:22.756
-when he hit my wire-haired terrier.
-[punchline rimshot]

15:22.840 --> 15:25.175
It wasn't funny.
The dog was seriously injured.

15:25.259 --> 15:26.885
-Five bucks.
-You cretin!

15:28.345 --> 15:30.889
[panting] Bruce!
Bruce, I need your help.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.475
I screwed up.
I screwed up bad.

15:33.559 --> 15:34.893
I'm so sorry, my sweet.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.728
-Now is not the opportune time.
-Okay.

15:36.812 --> 15:38.605
My crippling financial woes
have forced me

15:38.689 --> 15:41.024
to put all my objects
up for sale on Craigslist.

15:41.108 --> 15:43.777
And, right now, this college-aged viper

15:43.861 --> 15:45.362
is squeezing my manhood with his pricing.

15:45.446 --> 15:48.115
I'll give you... 200 bucks for everything.

15:48.198 --> 15:51.118
That is not a fair price,
kind sir, and you know it.

15:51.201 --> 15:53.203
I'm not the one
who needs money, fuck-o.

15:53.287 --> 15:54.746
You're living in your van?

15:54.830 --> 15:56.748
I thought you were parking out here
to think.

15:56.832 --> 15:58.167
I wouldn't call it living,

15:58.250 --> 15:59.626
-and I do my best not to think.
-Oh.

15:59.710 --> 16:02.254
Throw in that mini fridge
and I'll give you 40 dollars.

16:02.337 --> 16:04.214
How am I supposed to keep my cheeses cold?

16:04.298 --> 16:05.924
Bruce, I really screwed up.

16:06.008 --> 16:08.469
I really like Scott, but then I ran.

16:08.552 --> 16:10.929
I'm a coward! What...
What should I do?

16:11.013 --> 16:13.098
Hey, fucknut,
for every second you don't answer,

16:13.182 --> 16:16.143
I'm gonna shave $10 off my offer.
So, $230.

16:16.226 --> 16:18.187
-No. Just wait a second.
-So, what do I do?

16:18.312 --> 16:20.022
-$220.
-Just write him a note--

16:20.105 --> 16:21.148
$210.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.192
[Chantrelle] <i>I overnighted them.</i>
[Bruce] <i>I'm broke. I'm broke.</i>

16:23.275 --> 16:25.068
[Chantrelle] <i>$32,000.</i>
[Maria] Maybe I could e-mail--

16:25.152 --> 16:28.864
Look, Maria! I-- I just can't handle
your shit now! Okay?

16:28.947 --> 16:31.200
-Oh, God.
-[stuttering] Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.921
[Maria] <i>Even though I was having trouble</i>
<i>being in a relationship,</i>

16:44.004 --> 16:46.423
<i>I had come a long way</i>
<i>from my days in recovery.</i>

16:46.507 --> 16:48.592
Oh, Maria, thank you so much

16:48.675 --> 16:51.345
for helping me with my project,
Big Brother, Big Mother.

16:51.428 --> 16:56.058
That's Howard. He's done time.
And he's not exactly a sex offender,

16:56.141 --> 16:59.269
but he's not exactly not...
a sex offender,

16:59.353 --> 17:01.980
-if you catch my drift.
-No, I don't at all.

17:02.064 --> 17:06.193
He's working very hard on communication,
especially with women.

17:06.276 --> 17:07.611
Anyway, here.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.155
Honey, put this on.
I got it at the pet store.

17:10.239 --> 17:12.241
-I thought it would be fun.
-Okay.

17:12.324 --> 17:16.787
Howard, this is my daughter, Maria,
our makeshift woman.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.579
-Mom, I am a woman.
-I hear you roar,

17:18.664 --> 17:20.790
but, shh, hon-bun. This is Howard's time.

17:20.874 --> 17:23.669
Okay, and Howard,
what I want you to do

17:23.752 --> 17:27.589
is talk to Maria just like
you'd talk to... any of your buddies.

17:27.673 --> 17:31.260
And Maria, if you could...
try to listen to Howard.

17:31.343 --> 17:32.386
[Maria] Okay, okay.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.054
Hi, Maria.

17:35.597 --> 17:39.935
I believe women are not
second-class citizens.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.020
-[Maria] Oh, okay.
-[softly] Good.

17:42.813 --> 17:47.609
When I see Hillary Clinton on TV,
I don't wanna strangle her.

17:47.693 --> 17:50.362
I don't think
a lot of people can say that.

17:50.445 --> 17:53.031
Oh, that's great, Howard. That is great.

17:53.115 --> 17:56.577
Maria, do you have anything
you'd like to say back to Howard?

17:56.660 --> 17:58.537
[clicking tongue] Uh...

17:58.620 --> 17:59.997
[mumbling]

18:01.164 --> 18:03.250
I knew it. She hates me!
Every woman hates me.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.418
-I can't do this.
-Hey! Howard!

18:04.501 --> 18:05.586
Relax.

18:05.669 --> 18:07.838
-Take a slow, cleansing breath.
-[breathing deeply]

18:09.339 --> 18:11.508
Maria Elizabeth Sheldon Bamford,

18:11.592 --> 18:13.594
I'd like to see you over by the Hummels.

18:13.677 --> 18:16.471
-What the H gives, Maria?
-[sighing]

18:16.555 --> 18:20.267
-Why didn't you look him in the eyes?
-I have been.

18:20.350 --> 18:23.186
I look into people's eyes all--
all the time.

18:23.312 --> 18:25.314
Okay, little lady.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.316
Which of my eyes has conjunctivitis?

18:28.317 --> 18:30.736
-[mumbles] The right one.
-No, they both do!

18:30.819 --> 18:33.530
You would know that
if you weren't shutting out the world.

18:33.614 --> 18:36.033
Keep that chin up, little lady.

18:36.116 --> 18:37.367
I'll try.

18:37.451 --> 18:40.245
Try is will's lazy cousin.

18:40.329 --> 18:41.663
Do it, okay?

18:41.747 --> 18:43.915
And wash that chin. I'm pretty infected.

18:45.334 --> 18:49.588
Howard! No! Come, come.

Di-- Oh, my gosh.

[whimpering]

18:59.973 --> 19:01.266
[Maria] What the hell
has happened to me, Bert?

19:01.350 --> 19:03.894
Why can't I look into
people's eyes anymore?

19:03.977 --> 19:06.772
Did a spirit vandal break my soul windows?

19:06.855 --> 19:09.941
[groaning]
Why can't everyone be like you?

19:10.025 --> 19:12.152
You have the charming
physical appeal of...

19:12.235 --> 19:15.197
both a cute dog
and an 80-year-old man.

19:15.280 --> 19:18.408
And you're easy to talk to.
And... to look at.

19:18.492 --> 19:22.162
[Bert] That's because dogs
can't read human beings' minds, Maria.

19:22.245 --> 19:25.540
Exactly. You can't judge me.

19:25.624 --> 19:27.417
You can't even see all the horrible,

19:27.501 --> 19:29.503
unwanted thoughts that I'm thinking.

19:29.586 --> 19:32.089
Ones that I would never say out loud.
[chuckling]

19:32.172 --> 19:34.424
Even if I did, you wouldn't care.

19:34.508 --> 19:37.511
[Bert] I wouldn't even know
how to test out that premise.

19:37.594 --> 19:39.554
For I can't read your mind.

19:39.638 --> 19:42.474
Would you like to take that logic further,
my sweet queen?

19:42.557 --> 19:43.433
What do you mean?

19:43.517 --> 19:46.186
[Bert] Humans can't read
your mind either, Maria.

19:46.269 --> 19:48.772
Except that gypsy woman
on the other side of town.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.941
-She's actually got a gift.
-Oh.

19:51.024 --> 19:55.445
Maria, you can't worry about
putting your baggage on other people.

19:55.529 --> 19:59.825
The ones who love you...
will love you, baggage and all.

19:59.908 --> 20:02.327
Maybe this will help you understand.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.069
That's what happened with Scott.
And Bruce.

21:59.152 --> 22:02.405
You guys, stay here, take notes.
I gotta go.

22:03.198 --> 22:04.741
-Bruce! Ooh.
-Maria.

22:04.825 --> 22:07.702

I'm hideous!

-Aw.

I'm so sorry that I lost it today
on you, my pet.

22:14.417 --> 22:16.127
I lashed out at the one person

22:16.211 --> 22:18.880
who means more to me
than anything else in the world.

22:18.964 --> 22:21.216
Today, the world cut me in half.

22:22.133 --> 22:23.927
And put me back together
the wrong way.

22:24.010 --> 22:27.055
I'm like a 21st-century,
emotional Humpty Dumpty!

22:27.138 --> 22:30.392
[weeping] And I'm--
I'm so sorry, Maria.

22:30.475 --> 22:33.061
-I'm sorry.
-No, Bruce. Bruce, no.

22:33.186 --> 22:35.021
What you did-- It was good for me.

22:35.105 --> 22:36.773
-No, you're just saying that.
-Yes!

22:36.856 --> 22:40.360
Listen, I understand. I--
I used the brown word in anger.

22:40.443 --> 22:42.112
That's totally not acceptable!

22:42.195 --> 22:43.905
-No. It--
-I'm so ashamed.

22:43.989 --> 22:46.866
It was totally acceptable.
I put the brown word on you.

22:46.950 --> 22:50.954
You couldn't handle my brown word,
the same way I couldn't handle Scott's.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.414
I don't understand
what you're talking about.

22:52.497 --> 22:53.915
It's getting me kind of scared.

22:53.999 --> 22:56.042
Relationships. You have to handle
another person's brown word.

22:56.126 --> 22:59.170
Like the capuchin monkey,
I wanna handle your brown word, okay?

22:59.254 --> 23:02.674
I wanna handle your brown word
all day long! [chuckling]

23:02.757 --> 23:05.427
Oh, my God.
I'm feeling all these different feelings!

23:05.510 --> 23:07.637

-Speaking of restraining orders,

-Come on.
-Whoa.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.464
I'm taking you down to the station...

24:24.547 --> 24:26.424
-of my heart.
-What?

24:26.508 --> 24:28.134
I'd done a lot of work
on my road to wellness,

24:28.218 --> 24:31.930
but I didn't count on a side street
of trepidation that was unpaved.

24:32.013 --> 24:34.933
I've been a solitary
capuchin monkey for a while.

24:35.016 --> 24:37.644
I haven't had a partner. But now...

24:37.727 --> 24:39.813
I'm gonna treat my partner like a perp.

24:39.896 --> 24:42.732
And my perp is a capuchin monkey!

24:42.816 --> 24:45.402
Nature. Noir. Rico!

24:45.485 --> 24:46.945
Is this about the stories
from my childhood?

24:47.028 --> 24:48.613
-Yes.
-Yeah.

24:48.697 --> 24:51.199
Your stories about your father
hitting you with knives

24:51.282 --> 24:52.701
scared the capuchin monkey poo out of me.

24:52.784 --> 24:54.994
Your stuff about chopping up your family

24:55.078 --> 24:57.205
and having sex
with their bits is way scarier.

24:57.288 --> 24:58.415
-Exactly!
-Yeah.

24:58.498 --> 24:59.749
Because it's my shit.

24:59.833 --> 25:02.836
Other people's baggage
is always much worse than your own.

25:02.919 --> 25:04.295

25:04.379 --> 25:07.006
'cause I was able
to put my shit on other people.

But now I realize
that's just half the ball game.

25:09.300 --> 25:15.432
In a relationship, you need to be able
to handle the shit of another person.

25:16.641 --> 25:18.935
Scott, I want to handle your shit!

25:19.018 --> 25:20.770
I wanna handle your shit, Maria.

-No shit?
-I shit you not.
