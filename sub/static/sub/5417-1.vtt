02:20.120 --> 02:21.840
Darling Drusilla...

03:33.400 --> 03:35.960
<i>I have existed
from the morning of the world...</i>

03:36.160 --> 03:39.920
<i>...and I shall exist until the last star
falls from the heavens.</i>

03:40.000 --> 03:46.200
<i>Although I have taken the form of Gaius Caligula,
I am all men as I am no man and so...</i>

03:46.320 --> 03:48.440
<i>...I am a god.</i>

05:36.800 --> 05:39.880
- What's it like with Marcellus?
- With what like?

05:41.320 --> 05:45.160
- He's so fat! It's disgusting.
- He's not.

05:46.520 --> 05:49.760
- He's only large.
- And tiny where it counts.

05:51.960 --> 05:56.000
- How do you know?
- I saw him at the baths.

06:00.800 --> 06:04.920
- Poor... poor Drusilla.
- You are vile.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.920
- Hold!
- Messenger to the Prince!

06:11.955 --> 06:13.640
- Identify yourself!
- Macro!

06:16.320 --> 06:18.440
- Password?
- Justice.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.360
Prince?

06:42.600 --> 06:44.520
Forgive me, Prince.

06:45.200 --> 06:49.240
- The Emperor commands you to wait upon him.
- What does he want?

06:49.520 --> 06:52.880
A last look at you perhaps.
He is 77.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.880
May he live forever.

06:59.960 --> 07:06.520
- How is Ennia?
- My wife lives on if in the day
she can see you again, Prince.

07:09.080 --> 07:10.880
Wait outside.

07:27.600 --> 07:32.240
- What does all this mean?
- Take care, little boots.

07:33.040 --> 07:37.000
- Pray to Isis for me.
- I'll follow you as soon as I can.

07:50.880 --> 07:53.400
I hate I'm back here, Macro.

07:55.680 --> 07:57.600
He's planning something.

07:58.760 --> 08:02.200
You've nothing to fear.
I command Praetorian guards.

08:03.280 --> 08:05.560
With Tiberius,
there's always something to fear.

08:06.440 --> 08:10.080
Be very careful of Nerva.
They say he can even tell what you're thinking.

08:14.760 --> 08:15.285
Nerva!

08:15.320 --> 08:17.640
- Prince!
- Dear friend!

08:17.760 --> 08:20.440
Ten years is a long time for the Emperor
to be heading away.

08:21.080 --> 08:24.920
- I should feel a great deal happier...
- ... if he would back in Rome where he belongs.

08:25.240 --> 08:29.440
- Tell me, how is the Emperor?
- Old, like me.

08:30.120 --> 08:32.200
I mean, how is his mood?

08:33.039 --> 08:34.400
Like the weather.

08:34.919 --> 08:36.520
But the weather's good today.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.320
Changeable.

08:42.480 --> 08:47.560
I've heard that during the last month seven of my
colleagues in the senate have been put to death.

08:47.595 --> 08:48.720
...for treason.

08:49.280 --> 08:55.480
Nine to be exact. Five of them cheated.
They killed themselves.

08:56.120 --> 08:58.080
That wasn't playing fair.

08:59.240 --> 09:00.760
Don't you agree, Nerva?

09:02.640 --> 09:04.720
They were all good men.

09:07.600 --> 09:11.440
If they were good men, how could
the Beloved Emperor find them guilty?

09:12.120 --> 09:14.120
You have a gift for logic, Prince.

10:02.840 --> 10:04.280
Caligula!

10:11.680 --> 10:14.680
- Beloved grandfather.
- Do your dance, boy.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.680
- My dance?
- Yes.

10:17.800 --> 10:21.560
The one that you delighted the army
with when your father made you its mascot.

10:21.600 --> 10:22.520
Come on.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.520
Little boots.

10:27.200 --> 10:30.960
- I'd forgotten it, Lord!
- Oh, dance for me!

10:31.240 --> 10:32.600
Delight me!

10:33.920 --> 10:35.280
Dance!

10:45.920 --> 10:47.840
<i>My little fishies.</i>

10:48.120 --> 10:49.160
<i>Fishies.</i>

10:51.840 --> 10:55.160
Why not?
My little fishies! Come in!

10:55.360 --> 10:56.520
All of you!

11:52.360 --> 11:53.520
Stop that!

12:16.560 --> 12:20.560
Out, little fishies!
You've had enough for today!

12:24.800 --> 12:26.600
- Caligula!
- Yes, my Lord?

12:26.680 --> 12:29.640
Why do you say such monstrous things
about me at Rome?

12:29.760 --> 12:33.560
- I hear you often pray for my death.
- I don't, Lord, ever.

12:33.720 --> 12:35.360
You do not?

12:35.560 --> 12:38.440
By Heavens, Caesar,
I swear I do not.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.520
Yo do not in...

12:40.800 --> 12:42.320
...in public!

12:44.320 --> 12:45.640
Never, Lord!

12:45.680 --> 12:47.680
Remember this!

12:47.880 --> 12:50.160
That I have let you lived...

12:53.440 --> 12:54.920
...so far.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.360
My little fishies love me.

12:59.120 --> 13:02.400
Innocents, you see.

13:04.440 --> 13:06.600
I protect their innocence.

13:07.080 --> 13:10.720
This is the least I can do.
For it is a foul world.

13:11.640 --> 13:12.840
Rise up.

13:15.520 --> 13:19.480
Nerva is scouting at us.
Help me, Nerva.

13:20.040 --> 13:23.520
Help me tranform this young barbarian
into a Roman caesar.

13:23.560 --> 13:28.400
There have been three Roman caesars.
Julius, Augustus and yourself.

13:29.160 --> 13:31.360
- Which do you want him to be?
- Best.

13:31.640 --> 13:37.320
- That would be your father, Augustus.
- You see, Caligula, I'm insulted to my face.

13:39.880 --> 13:44.120
Nerva, dear friend!
Watch out for Macro when I'm dead.

13:45.160 --> 13:50.560
- I know. He hates me...
- ...because you are wise.

13:51.760 --> 13:59.320
Because you are good.
So when I'm gone, watch out for Macro.

14:00.800 --> 14:03.360
I've taken my precautions, Caesar.

14:05.880 --> 14:07.720
Hmm. What might they be?

14:12.960 --> 14:17.040
Heaven help Rome!
For I'm gone!

14:18.920 --> 14:22.920
- I am old.
- Yes, Lord, but you will live forever.

14:22.960 --> 14:28.200
All my family are dead but you,
child Gemellus and that...

14:28.320 --> 14:30.360
...Claudius that's uncle.

14:31.280 --> 14:33.880
The others struck down by fate.

14:36.160 --> 14:40.920
And it is fate, little boots,
that rules us, not any god.

14:41.360 --> 14:43.160
You are a god, Lord.

14:45.240 --> 14:48.320
No, I'm not!
Not even when I'm dead.

14:48.520 --> 14:51.960
Julius Caesar and Augustus Caesar,
they are gods.

14:52.400 --> 14:55.760
So say the Senate
and so the people prefer to believe.

14:55.920 --> 14:57.600
Such myth they use.

15:06.520 --> 15:10.960
- Little boots, just look at you.
- Yes, Caesar?

15:17.120 --> 15:22.080
I am mercy.
A viper in Rome's bosom.

15:35.800 --> 15:36.800
Uncle!

15:51.160 --> 15:52.600
Caligula!

15:53.240 --> 15:56.360
Do you think
this boy have been drinking?

15:57.320 --> 16:00.200
- I think he has, Caesar.
- So do I! Macro!

16:00.480 --> 16:02.400
- Yes, Lord?
- Bring him more wine!

16:02.680 --> 16:04.400
And waste none.

16:11.600 --> 16:13.520
<i>Remove your bootlaces.</i>

16:53.120 --> 16:58.520
- And what do thet say of me at Rome?
- Oh, well, they need you, Lord and they miss you.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.080
Most of my life I have given
to the Roman people.

17:02.520 --> 17:04.040
I have fought.

17:05.599 --> 17:06.880
I have given all.

17:10.359 --> 17:13.400
- Aren't they lovely?
- Yes, Lord.

17:13.435 --> 17:15.280
The Satyrs are from Illyria.

17:17.400 --> 17:18.680
And... uh...

17:20.960 --> 17:24.720
This Nymph... is from...
Where are you from?

17:26.640 --> 17:27.960
<i>Britain, Lord.</i>

17:28.640 --> 17:29.880
Britain.

17:30.560 --> 17:37.040
- Speaking statues.
- Yes, yes! And they do more than speak. They do...

17:39.960 --> 17:44.000
- You prefer nymphs to satyrs?
- I like both, Lord.

17:44.400 --> 17:48.320
One needs both.
Yes. To keep healthy.

17:51.600 --> 17:55.720
Rome is a republic and
you and I are playing citizens.

17:56.280 --> 17:57.760
More confection!

18:22.560 --> 18:23.640
That's it!

18:47.400 --> 18:49.600
That's the best of my stallions.

18:51.000 --> 18:56.320
Serve the state, Caligula, although
the people in it are wicked beasts.

18:56.480 --> 18:59.960
- But they love you, Lord.
- Oh, no! No!

19:00.320 --> 19:04.680
They fear me.
And that is much better.

19:10.720 --> 19:12.760
I had no choice, you see.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.120
<i>No choice.</i>

19:15.320 --> 19:16.640
No choice?

19:17.360 --> 19:19.960
All I wanted was private life.

19:21.000 --> 19:24.680
I did not truly want to become emperor,
but I had to.

19:24.880 --> 19:25.800
Had to?

19:25.840 --> 19:29.640
If someone else had become emperor,
I would have been killed.

19:31.720 --> 19:33.200
As you will be.

19:36.640 --> 19:37.720
Will be?

19:44.040 --> 19:45.840
Will be gra... gr...

20:08.160 --> 20:12.760
- Will be, Grandfather?
- Would be, if you were not my heir.

20:14.000 --> 20:19.680
When Rome was just a city and we were
just citizens, we're known to one another.

20:21.800 --> 20:25.960
And we were frugal, good,
disciplined and dignified.

20:33.520 --> 20:36.200
<i>The Romans I rule
are not like we were.</i>

20:36.760 --> 20:41.440
<i>They lust... they lust for power
and pleasure.</i>

20:41.880 --> 20:44.840
Money...
the wives of other men...

20:45.760 --> 20:48.760
<i>Oh, yes,
I am a true moralist.</i>

20:49.720 --> 20:52.080
And stern as any Cato.

20:54.440 --> 21:00.000
Faith chose me to govern swine in my old day
which I have become a swine-herd.

21:01.680 --> 21:06.720
- The faithless boy! Has he drunk enough wine?
- I think he's drunk enough, Lord.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.160
So do I.

21:23.040 --> 21:25.440
<i>Now he is happy.</i>

21:26.760 --> 21:31.240
Homer! You would not know that?
You were educated in army caps only.

21:31.280 --> 21:33.040
<i>You will know enough
to be a swine-herd.</i>

21:33.520 --> 21:36.520
Caesar? The Senate sends these
documents for your signature.

21:36.555 --> 21:37.480
Of course!

21:44.360 --> 21:46.840
The revise list to candidates
for the requested order.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.520
I, Tiberius Caesar, command on the name
of the Senate and the people of Rome.

21:53.600 --> 21:56.280
<i>Tax assessment, regime minor,
Brescia and Gaul.</i>

21:56.320 --> 22:00.600
I, Tiberius Caesar, command on the name
of the Senate and the people of Rome.

22:07.120 --> 22:08.440
Senator guilty of treason.

22:08.920 --> 22:15.320
Every senator believes himself to be a potential
Caesar, therefore every senator is guilty of treason.

22:15.560 --> 22:17.040
In thought,
if not indeed.

22:18.040 --> 22:21.800
The Senate is the natural enemy
of any Caesar, Little Boots.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.120
Remember that.

22:23.440 --> 22:25.240
Traitors. Look at them.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.080
Traitors.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.360
They offer to prove any law I made
before I made it.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.000
I said: "What if I go mad?
What then?"

22:41.080 --> 22:46.320
No answer. They were born to be slaves,
Germanicus, never forget that.

22:46.520 --> 22:49.720
I'm not Germanicus, Lord.
I'm his son, Caligula.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.960
Yes.
And your friend is Macro.

22:53.600 --> 22:57.520
- He serves you and only you, Lord.
- And his wife is your friend, too.

22:57.640 --> 23:02.000
- Is she friendly in bed?
- We must ask Macro that, Lord.

23:02.360 --> 23:06.160
- She seems friendly.
- And your sister, Drusilla...

23:07.240 --> 23:10.240
My sister is my sister, Lord.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.480
I know everything
that is said and done.

23:15.640 --> 23:17.000
And thought.

23:18.960 --> 23:22.880
The setting sun
and the rising moon.

23:26.600 --> 23:32.000
Gemellus, lovely boy!
And too young to betray me.

23:32.200 --> 23:33.880
Perhaps not too young.

23:35.160 --> 23:40.080
Yes. Kiss your old grandfather.
Yes. My last grandson.

23:40.640 --> 23:44.280
- I am your grandson, too, Caesar.
- By adoption.

23:45.200 --> 23:48.400
This is the last flesh of my flesh.

23:49.080 --> 23:53.840
- Poor boy! What'd it become of you?
- He's like a brother to me, Lord.

23:53.880 --> 23:56.920
Brother?
Another brother is enough envy.

23:57.160 --> 24:03.200
Brother kills a brother
who's killed his father who's killed his son.

24:03.480 --> 24:05.720
Faith!
Drink, Caligula.

24:11.240 --> 24:13.080
After you, dear brother.

24:19.840 --> 24:21.160
Poor boy!

24:22.320 --> 24:26.320
When I am gone, Caligula will kill you.

24:27.640 --> 24:31.560
And then,
someone will kill Caligula.

24:37.680 --> 24:41.480
Unless... unless he is dead,
before I am.

24:42.840 --> 24:45.640
You are looking not well at all.

25:00.200 --> 25:07.600
I, Caligula Caesar, command on name
of the Senate and people of Rome.

25:22.400 --> 25:26.280
<i>A brother kills a brother...
who's killed his father...</i>

25:26.560 --> 25:31.645
<i>...who's killed his son.
Faith!</i>

25:31.680 --> 25:33.800
<i>And then
someone's killed Caligula...</i>

25:38.280 --> 25:43.520
- He's going to kill me!
- Sssh. You're safe. You're with me.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.160
He's going to kill us.

25:47.920 --> 25:52.840
Because that we killed our father,
our mother and our brothers.

25:57.520 --> 26:02.280
- I am not going to die!
- You won't!

26:02.400 --> 26:05.240
You're his heir.
There is no one else.

26:06.480 --> 26:13.200
Yeah, it is. There's Gemellus
an Claudius.

26:14.480 --> 26:18.820
Gemellus is too young,
Claudius is an idiot...

26:18.855 --> 26:23.160
...and Tiberius is old.
You will be emperor. Soon.

26:29.120 --> 26:34.000
- And you will be my queen.
- You can't marry your sister.

26:35.160 --> 26:37.920
- You can in Egypt.
- But we're in Rome...

26:38.320 --> 26:40.120
...and you're already promised.

26:44.760 --> 26:47.440
I know... To Ennia...

26:58.120 --> 27:00.000
It's only a bird.

27:07.880 --> 27:10.400
- Prince?
- Hmm? What is it?

27:11.160 --> 27:12.320
My wife.

27:15.680 --> 27:17.560
Ennia!

27:32.640 --> 27:36.480
Now you are a man, Caligula.
What are you going to do?

27:36.960 --> 27:40.560
You must be the master
of your own destiny.

27:40.720 --> 27:44.560
Take it... with both hands.

28:08.560 --> 28:12.920
<i>Preteens!
Why did you permit him to do it?</i>

28:15.320 --> 28:17.120
Bind his wrists!

28:17.800 --> 28:19.960
<i>Bind his wrists!</i>

28:26.200 --> 28:30.160
You must not go, you must not leave me.
You're my friend, my only friend.

28:30.680 --> 28:34.960
I've lived too long, Tiberius,
I hate my life.

28:35.640 --> 28:36.880
Leave us!

28:37.320 --> 28:38.680
Both of you!

28:38.920 --> 28:45.120
The man to choose the hour of his own death
is the closest he will ever come to tricking faith.

28:45.480 --> 28:49.720
And faith decreased that when you die,
Macro will kill me.

28:49.755 --> 28:52.320
I'll arrest him and have him executed.

28:52.355 --> 28:54.760
You can't. He controls you.

28:55.400 --> 29:03.520
Anyway, even if Macro dead,
how could I go on living with this reptile?

29:06.360 --> 29:09.520
You will respect my friend always,
won't you, reptile?

29:09.555 --> 29:11.720
I've always respected him, Lord.

29:12.160 --> 29:16.445
- You hear?
- Tiberius, you were wise once.

29:16.480 --> 29:22.200
- Ah, don't taunt me. I'm old.
- I watched you go into a monster.

29:22.600 --> 29:28.680
One by one, I've seen you murder your family,
your friends, the noblest men in Rome.

29:28.715 --> 29:31.440
- That is treason?
- No, it's the truth.

29:33.320 --> 29:36.280
I and my oath had been
surrounded by enemies.

29:37.240 --> 29:41.480
My own family and the Senate...
You're cruel!

29:42.240 --> 29:43.280
You're cruel!

29:43.320 --> 29:48.560
No, honest old men
can sometimes see the future.

29:48.760 --> 29:55.320
So, from evils pass
and evils yet to come...

29:56.360 --> 29:59.800
...I now choose to escape.

30:08.840 --> 30:11.640
So these are your precautions, Nerva?

30:43.560 --> 30:50.520
- Nerva, what's it like?
- Warm, no pain, just drifting away.

30:51.000 --> 30:52.840
- Do you see her?
- Who?

30:53.120 --> 30:54.840
The Goddess.
Isis.

30:54.960 --> 30:58.720
- Oh, you're one of those who believe...
- Do you see her?

31:00.440 --> 31:02.640
- No.
- Are you sure?

31:07.800 --> 31:11.840
You're almost dead. What's it like?
What's happening to you now?

31:12.920 --> 31:15.645
- Nothing.
- You're lying.

31:15.680 --> 31:19.080
You can see her.
I know you can. What is she like?

31:19.160 --> 31:23.560
No... nothing at all...

31:25.080 --> 31:29.600
...just... sleep...

31:30.200 --> 31:31.920
Liar!

32:48.640 --> 32:52.040
<i>Since Nerva died, Tiberius has
been brought paralyzed.</i>

32:52.080 --> 32:56.080
- They say he's close to death.
- Tiberius dies, be worse for us.

32:56.120 --> 32:59.040
- Yeah, you love the bastard.
- Take that back!

33:46.800 --> 33:50.120
Prince! The physician Charicles.

34:08.239 --> 34:11.679
How is the Emperor?
How long will he last?

34:12.040 --> 34:16.760
Well, it could happen any moment,
but with care he might last a year or so.

34:22.040 --> 34:24.199
I can smell death...

34:24.960 --> 34:29.480
- ...but whose?
- Don't worry! He can do nothing without me.

34:30.679 --> 34:33.960
So these poor unfortunate creatures
thought...

34:35.040 --> 34:40.440
...and where are they?
No, Macro. He's planning something.

34:40.880 --> 34:42.760
You'll be emperor, soon.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.800
- You swear.
- I sw...

35:16.080 --> 35:17.760
I swear.

36:00.400 --> 36:03.000
Leave!
Everyone leave!

36:48.720 --> 36:50.520
Tiberius!

36:56.880 --> 36:58.560
Tiberius!

38:03.680 --> 38:05.800
Caligula?

38:07.000 --> 38:08.080
Lord!

38:09.320 --> 38:11.920
Give me my ring.

38:20.080 --> 38:23.200
- No!
- Yes.

38:34.720 --> 38:38.640
You... do not dare!

38:39.440 --> 38:40.440
Prince!

38:40.480 --> 38:43.120
You do not dare!

39:53.840 --> 39:55.480
Hail, Caesar!

39:58.280 --> 39:59.520
Hail, Caesar!

39:59.720 --> 40:03.840
I'd get everyone a symbol and a hope.
For the announcement.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.840
Gemellus?

40:56.760 --> 40:58.200
Gemellus!

41:05.080 --> 41:06.600
Hail, Caesar.

41:10.200 --> 41:13.600
Gemellus. We are alone.

41:21.640 --> 41:23.560
We must love each other.

41:36.680 --> 41:40.720
Rest, Tiberius Caesar.

41:43.800 --> 41:48.880
Hail, Caligula Caesar.

41:53.800 --> 41:55.760
It's just like the dream.

41:58.600 --> 42:01.880
It's only his mask.
You are Caesar now.

42:03.560 --> 42:04.520
Caesar.

42:04.840 --> 42:09.040
Caesar, Emperor of Rome,
lord of the world.

42:10.440 --> 42:12.360
Lord of the world...

42:13.840 --> 42:15.880
I liked this dream.

42:36.240 --> 42:37.280
At the...

42:45.480 --> 42:50.240
At the insistence of the Senate
and the people of Rome...

42:51.480 --> 42:54.760
...I accept... humbly...

42:56.160 --> 43:00.200
...the highest office of our great republic.

43:05.400 --> 43:07.640
Our great republic.

43:25.360 --> 43:27.560
Where's the onion?
Give me the onion.

43:53.520 --> 43:55.480
Now beloved Tiberius was dying...

43:55.520 --> 43:59.280
- To the Tiber with Tiberius!
- Yes! Yes!

43:59.680 --> 44:03.480
- Throw him to the river!
- Yes! Yes!

44:04.000 --> 44:07.080
- Tiberius! Throw him! Throw him to the dark!
- Yes! Yes!

44:07.160 --> 44:11.080
Today we begin a new era.

44:11.120 --> 44:13.480
I grant a general amnesty.

44:13.515 --> 44:15.840
- Hail!
- Hail! Hail! Hail!

44:16.600 --> 44:24.000
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

44:24.120 --> 44:25.520
- Silence!
- Caesar! Caesar!

44:25.560 --> 44:26.780
Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

44:26.815 --> 44:28.000
- Silence!
- Caesar! Caesar!

44:28.240 --> 44:30.720
Great Caesar is not finished.

44:37.240 --> 44:41.680
As my fellow counsel,
the Senate and the people of Rome...

44:41.715 --> 44:45.000
...have wisely chosen
my loved uncle Claudius.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.560
Hail, Cladius!

44:47.520 --> 44:49.920
Take your place beside me, Claudius.

44:54.040 --> 44:57.200
- Ceasar Caligola...
- Take your place...

44:57.280 --> 44:59.240
I mean Calisus...

45:06.120 --> 45:09.080
I here with adopt as my son and heir...

45:09.560 --> 45:11.440
...the Prince Gemellus.

45:11.760 --> 45:14.480
- Come forth, Prince.
- Hail, Gemellus!

45:27.320 --> 45:32.360
From this moment, all official oaths
will contain the following phrase:..

45:33.200 --> 45:37.440
"I will value neither my life,
nor the lives of my children..."

45:37.680 --> 45:40.360
"...any more highly than I do the Emperor."

45:40.560 --> 45:44.120
Hail! Hail! Hail!

45:44.320 --> 45:46.760
"And of his sister, Drusilla."

45:55.520 --> 46:00.000
- Hail Drusilla!
- Hail Caligola!

46:07.800 --> 46:09.720
We must be careful of him.

46:13.840 --> 46:18.360
- Oh, Claudius?
- No, Gemellus.

46:20.720 --> 46:24.080
Oh, yes! Gemellus.

46:29.080 --> 46:32.840
Did you see their faces when I told 'em
I had to swear not only to me?

46:33.480 --> 46:34.840
But to you?

46:35.160 --> 46:36.640
They were appalled.

46:38.760 --> 46:41.560
- I do hope so.
- But is it wise?

46:49.320 --> 46:50.760
I can do...

47:00.080 --> 47:02.120
...anything I like...

47:06.360 --> 47:11.320
- ...to anyone.
- Well, don't start with me.

47:14.080 --> 47:15.800
Who do you suggest?

48:14.400 --> 48:17.120
Get out! Out!

48:19.280 --> 48:23.440
- Who?
- Why not start with Macro?

48:24.160 --> 48:26.040
- Macro?
- Yes.

48:26.480 --> 48:29.440
Before he controls you
as he controlled Tiberius.

48:32.520 --> 48:35.080
Superb! It's bright, Macro.
Superb!

48:42.600 --> 48:45.920
- Fetch me Gemellus.
- What? Here?

48:47.960 --> 48:49.920
Yes, here. Now.

48:56.680 --> 48:58.480
- Charicles!
- My Lord?

48:58.600 --> 48:59.840
Stand here.

49:04.920 --> 49:08.640
- I want to bonus for my guards.
- Oh, but Caesar, that's not possible!

49:08.760 --> 49:10.685
All things that happen
are possible, Longinus.

49:10.720 --> 49:13.160
Make the impossible happen,
then it'd be possible. Logical?

49:13.360 --> 49:17.440
- How, Caesar? The deficit, you see, is...
- Look, how much is my purse?

49:18.080 --> 49:22.000
- Well, Lord, that is as much as you may require.
- Oh, good!

49:22.760 --> 49:26.240
Ah, Macro!
Would you stand over there?

49:30.720 --> 49:34.360
- Longinus, you here.
- Yes, Caesar.

49:35.520 --> 49:41.280
Gemellus! I want you to look at
these gentlemen very carefully.

49:42.320 --> 49:45.200
Take your time and tell me...

49:46.720 --> 49:49.800
...who killed our beloved Tiberius?

49:56.520 --> 49:59.040
Who killed Tiberius?

50:15.240 --> 50:18.720
He did! Macro!

50:27.800 --> 50:29.120
Murderer.

50:38.600 --> 50:40.040
Arrest him!

50:56.120 --> 50:59.960
In honor of your new commander,
Chaerea...

51:00.880 --> 51:03.200
...ten gold pieces to every man!

51:03.280 --> 51:06.640
Hail! Hail! Hail!

51:09.040 --> 51:13.320
- Chaerea, arrest Macro.
- Guards, arrest Macro.

51:15.760 --> 51:17.440
Don't you dare!

51:46.440 --> 51:47.920
Forgive me, Caesar...

51:49.920 --> 51:50.800
Ah, Caerea!

51:50.840 --> 51:52.920
Two senators beg to see you.

51:53.000 --> 51:54.640
They have a disputable land.

51:54.840 --> 51:58.400
- And they wait your judgment.
- Ah, bring them in.

51:58.440 --> 51:59.680
Bring them in.

52:00.600 --> 52:06.200
I'm interesting all there is Rome,
even down to the land of the Toga.

52:06.560 --> 52:07.160
Amnar!

52:21.560 --> 52:25.560
- Caesar, I must complain about the vow...
- Give me the documents.

52:52.080 --> 52:54.600
- Guilty.
- Thank you! Thank you!

52:54.800 --> 53:00.240
Don't thank.
Justice must always be impartial.

53:00.600 --> 53:05.400
- It is so, Chaerea! Is it?
- Yes.

53:06.560 --> 53:07.760
You may go.

53:44.440 --> 53:45.760
Ennia!

53:54.520 --> 53:56.000
You look beautiful.

54:03.480 --> 54:05.320
Is it good for growing hair?

54:06.960 --> 54:10.320
We'll be married soon.
Divorce will only take a few days.

54:13.520 --> 54:16.920
- I think we should move.
- Move? Where?

54:18.520 --> 54:20.480
Alexandria, say.

54:21.680 --> 54:23.440
To Egypt?

54:24.280 --> 54:25.440
Yeah!

54:26.680 --> 54:27.680
What do you think?

54:28.040 --> 54:32.040
I'd hate to leave Rome.
I mean, the Senate...

54:32.360 --> 54:36.960
No, no, Ennia. I am Rome.
Wherever I am, Rome is.

54:37.080 --> 54:39.800
There is the Senate
and the people of Rome.

54:42.800 --> 54:46.160
You don't make me laugh.
The way you say that.

54:55.480 --> 54:59.240
- Ah, Longinus.
- Forgive us, Caesar.

55:03.720 --> 55:07.840
- Longinus, is it done?
- The Senate has sentenced him to death.

55:11.760 --> 55:13.240
The commission.

55:18.120 --> 55:22.880
Chaerea, I now officially appoint you
commander of my imperial guard.

55:24.400 --> 55:28.245
But what about Macro?
What happened? Where is he?

55:28.280 --> 55:32.360
- He has been arrested for treason.
- That's impossible!

55:32.960 --> 55:36.520
Caesar, you know he worshipped you.
He made you!

55:43.680 --> 55:48.240
- Nobody made me.
- I... I can't believe it.

55:48.960 --> 55:50.400
What did he do?

55:51.560 --> 55:57.320
Ennia! I had to take my destiny,
with my own hands.

56:08.480 --> 56:09.480
Guards!

56:09.520 --> 56:10.720
Guards!

56:13.960 --> 56:16.040
Chaerea! She's to be back.

56:17.080 --> 56:19.120
- I love you!
- To Gal!

56:20.320 --> 56:21.560
I love you!

56:23.600 --> 56:26.960
Caligula! How could you do it?
He was your friend.

56:27.040 --> 56:29.080
He would've done anything for you!

56:29.520 --> 56:31.000
Don't send me away!

56:31.840 --> 56:33.760
I love you!

56:34.120 --> 56:35.720
Caligula!

56:38.960 --> 56:41.240
Now at least she doesn't
have to get a divorce.

56:41.840 --> 56:44.160
But you still have to find
a suitable wife.

56:45.240 --> 56:46.200
No.

56:51.480 --> 56:53.240
I'm going to marry you.

56:53.800 --> 56:56.240
You can't!
We're not Egyptians.

56:57.600 --> 56:58.720
I know.

56:59.680 --> 57:01.560
We are much more beautiful.

57:01.960 --> 57:03.560
Rome is not Egypt.

57:04.160 --> 57:06.760
And stop looking at yourself
like that.

57:09.720 --> 57:12.680
- Let's go to Egypt then.
- You are a fool!

57:13.400 --> 57:16.840
- Caesar cannot be a fool.
- But he's trying very hard.

57:16.920 --> 57:20.120
Caesar cannot be a fool!

57:20.560 --> 57:25.560
Little Boots! They'll throw you in the Tiber,
if you temp to move the government.

57:25.920 --> 57:31.680
So, you are going to marry a respectable
Roman lady of the senatorial class.

57:34.080 --> 57:36.360
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

57:36.400 --> 57:37.840
You've got to have an heir.

57:41.560 --> 57:43.880
Who will kill me when he grows up.

57:46.240 --> 57:49.280
The priestess of Isis are meeting
at my house tonight.

57:51.000 --> 57:52.800
You want me to marry one of them?

57:53.160 --> 57:53.960
Yes.

57:54.280 --> 57:55.240
No!

57:55.560 --> 57:56.200
Yes!

57:57.800 --> 57:58.680
No.

58:00.760 --> 58:01.920
Yes.

58:17.880 --> 58:19.800
I wonder what I should wear.

58:46.480 --> 58:50.120
- When just the performance for almighty Caesar?
- Don't be disgusting.

58:50.160 --> 58:54.080
But I'm being practical. If I'm to chose a wife,
I want to see what I'm within.

58:55.440 --> 58:56.520
Logic.

59:23.000 --> 59:25.440
Out that one looks rather interesting.

59:26.000 --> 59:30.560
Livia? Oh, she's taken. She's to marry
Proculus, one of your officers.

59:30.595 --> 59:31.800
I'll send him to Spain.

59:31.960 --> 59:35.400
She's a virgin. Very boring.
Not your style.

01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:45.120
- That will be my wife.
- Oh, no! Not Caesonia.

01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:50.240
- Oh! You're impossible!
- She's the most mysterious woman in Rome!

01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:52.680
Perfect.

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:05.240
Caesonia's been divorced.
She's extravagant. Always in debt.

01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.040
- I want her.
- But not for a wife.

01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:14.200
- Send her to me now!
- No, Little Boots! I won't let you do it!

01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.480
It wouldn't be wise.

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.240
Yes!

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.920
Such as the will of the senate
and the people of Rome.

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:32.600
You're very convincing
as a priestess, Caesar.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:40.200
And you...
as a sacrificial lamb, Caesonia.

01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.760
I told Caesonia that I would marry her.

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:55.360
- Don't...
- Ah, but only after she's born me a son.

01:04:55.395 --> 01:04:56.840
How will you ever know it's yours?

01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.400
Don't worry.
I've got her very well guarded.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.480
Can you be sure one of the guards
will be the father?

01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:07.600
They're all homosexuals
who have been castrated.

01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:49.480
If only all Rome had just one neck.

01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.840
Is that the officer
Livia's going to marry with?

01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.360
Yes. Proculus.

01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:15.560
Proculus.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:19.805
- Longinus...
- Caesar?

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:23.040
...you see this young officer
over here? Proculus?

01:06:23.075 --> 01:06:24.320
Yeah?

01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:14.080
Caligula Caesar, Emperor of Rome!

01:07:14.120 --> 01:07:16.800
- Hail!
- Hail!

01:07:18.920 --> 01:07:25.000
- And the lady Drusilla and the lady Caesonia.
- And the lady Drusilla and the lady Caesonia.

01:07:25.120 --> 01:07:27.000
- Hail!
- Hail!

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:33.560
- Are we late?
- No, Caesar.

01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:34.960
You forgive us.

01:07:35.920 --> 01:07:39.240
Was the ceremony beautiful?
The augury is good?

01:07:39.280 --> 01:07:42.680
- Yes, Caesar.
- Splendid.

01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.040
You are very gracious to come.

01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.480
You are a Roman hero.

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:04.920
Caesar.

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.720
I shall now bestow
the special blessings of almighty Casear...

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.720
...upon this...

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:25.160
...happy union.

01:08:29.399 --> 01:08:31.640
Which way is the secret marriage bed?

01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:56.000
Ah! The kitchen!
Oh, this will have to do!

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:00.399
See you later!

01:09:00.880 --> 01:09:02.040
Little Boots!

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:05.000
I thought you didn't like virgins.

01:09:05.319 --> 01:09:06.840
I've never known any.

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.160
That is correct, Caesonia?

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:20.040
And now for Caesar's wedding gift.

01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:31.399
What a delicious bride!

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:36.800
Take off that robe.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:47.520
Splendid.

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:06.240
- Is she really a virgin, Proculus?
- Yes, Caesar.

01:10:07.760 --> 01:10:09.880
One can never be quite sure.

01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:15.240
Open your eyes, Livia!

01:10:33.360 --> 01:10:37.600
Lucky girl! To lose once virginity...

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.840
...to a direct descent of the goddess Venus.

01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:43.280
I...

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.760
...Caligula Caesar...

01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:47.520
...command...

01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:50.680
Open your eyes, Proculus.

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:54.480
...command in the name of the Senate...
open 'em!

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:04.600
...the Senate and the people of Rome!

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.440
She really was a virgin.

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:35.480
Are you?

01:11:41.280 --> 01:11:43.080
Well? Are you?

01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.080
- No, Caesar.
- No?

01:11:46.840 --> 01:11:50.840
Well, Isis won't like that! One law
for woman, one for man! That's no fair!

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.440
Come on!
Off with your clothes!

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:05.560
Splendid!

01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.400
I like your nice bushy hair, Proculus!

01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:16.200
- Caesar! I beg you!
- So sit up!

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.560
I think you were lying to me.

01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:32.360
You're a virgin, too.

01:12:50.040 --> 01:12:51.120
I...

01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:53.200
...Caligula Caesar...

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:57.120
...command...
in the name of the Senate...

01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:59.680
Open your eyes, Livia!

01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:03.320
...and the people of Rome...

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:19.520
You see how I exhausted myself
to make your wedding holy.

01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.720
My blessings to you both!

01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.280
Gemellus!

01:14:15.480 --> 01:14:16.680
Caligula!

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:19.320
Caligula!

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.320
Gemellus!

01:14:53.480 --> 01:14:56.000
Jupiter loves me!

01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:01.920
Drusilla!

01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:14.040
- He's trying to kill me!
- Who, Little Boots?

01:15:14.880 --> 01:15:19.520
Gemellus! I saw him! He ran away!
Wants me dead!

01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:32.920
Now... now, Little Boots!

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:38.320
Now you'll be alright!

01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.600
Now...

01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.240
Hail, Caesar!

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.840
- Hail!
- Hail, Caesar!

01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:41.400
All hail Ceasar's
beautiful horse, Incitartus.

01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:44.440
Hail the most honorable Incitartus!

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.600
Hail, Incitartus!

01:20:49.200 --> 01:20:52.440
There's Gemellus over there.
Watch him.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:10.800
Chop chop, dear uncle, chop chop!

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.360
I want your honest advise.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:17.000
Shall I make myself king of Rome?

01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:21.520
King?
Well, but this is republic, isn't it?

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:23.400
Very well, then.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.640
I shall make myself king of the republic.

01:21:27.760 --> 01:21:30.520
But you're already greater
than any king, Caesar.

01:21:31.560 --> 01:21:33.080
I am a god!

01:21:33.880 --> 01:21:35.920
Or at least I will be when I'm dead.

01:21:50.040 --> 01:21:53.480
Gemellus, try one of these morels.
Gemellus!

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.520
- What's that smell?
- What smell, Caesar?

01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:07.240
- What have you been taking?
- Just a medicine. A bit to drop off the fever.

01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:10.600
- Did you give him medicine for the fever?
- Well...

01:22:10.635 --> 01:22:13.280
- Yes or no?
- No, I don't.

01:22:14.440 --> 01:22:18.920
Gemellus! Are you accusing your
sovereign for being a poisoner?

01:22:18.960 --> 01:22:20.680
But I never accused you, Caesar!

01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:24.040
You took an antidote
before coming to my table.

01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.200
Which is tend to mount
for accusing me poisoning you.

01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:29.560
That is awkward, isn't it?

01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.320
Caligula!

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.240
Chaerea!

01:22:49.000 --> 01:22:50.840
Arrest Gemellus...

01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:52.640
...for treason.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000
Guards! Take him away!

01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:01.800
No!

01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:04.480
No!

01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:08.080
No!

01:23:11.160 --> 01:23:12.320
No, please!

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.320
As if there ever could be
an antidote against Caesar.

01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:29.920
Drusilla!

01:23:30.680 --> 01:23:33.960
- Why are you so concerned for him?
- I'm not concerned for him.

01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:36.680
- But for you!
- He knows about Tiberius!

01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:40.440
- He's a threat to me!
- He's not! He's not even your heir!

01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:44.120
Caesonia now carries your child.

01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:51.120
- Gemellus will die!
- You amateur!

01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:52.760
Amateur?

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:48.000
And they weren't even poisoned.

01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.320
Caesar!

01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.640
Well done!

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:15.680
What will you do to her?
What she said was treason.

01:25:18.000 --> 01:25:20.160
I decide what is treason, not you.

01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:23.840
Dance!

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:27.520
- Dance?
- Yes.

01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:29.880
And what about your son?

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.560
Show Incitartus your new dance.

01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:35.240
My son...

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:38.000
...he will dance with you.

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.360
Music!

01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:37.640
You are... beautiful...

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:41.080
...Drusil...

01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:43.200
...beautiful.

01:27:44.280 --> 01:27:45.920
We are all alone...

01:27:46.840 --> 01:27:47.840
...Drusil.

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:26.840
- He's going to kill me.
- No.

01:28:26.875 --> 01:28:28.200
He can't kill me.

01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:34.160
- The fever must be at soothe.
- He's going to kill me.

01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.920
- What if it doesn't?
- He's going to kill me.

01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:38.560
He's going to kill me.

01:28:40.680 --> 01:28:41.640
Drusilla!

01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.600
Drusilla!

01:28:44.040 --> 01:28:45.120
He's going to kill me!

01:28:46.440 --> 01:28:47.640
He's going to kill...

01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:48.800
...me!

01:28:53.040 --> 01:28:54.320
Drusilla!

01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:55.840
Tell you...

01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:58.240
...I love you!

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:13.480
- Where is my sister?
- She's coming.

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:29.520
I'm here, Little Boots.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:34.800
Drusilla...

01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.160
- ...I'm dying.
- You are not.

01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:41.560
I must...

01:29:42.360 --> 01:29:43.800
...make my will.

01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.560
Don't talk. Sleep.

01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:50.160
Longinus.
I want Longinus.

01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:57.080
Take my horse to his own bed.

01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:04.240
- He's a monster.
- Even so, it's better that he doesn't die this time.

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.320
- I don't see, why?
- The people love him.

01:30:06.360 --> 01:30:09.840
There could be more revolutions,
civil chaos, if he dies.

01:30:09.960 --> 01:30:12.240
It looks as if he's claimed
to die anyway.

01:30:15.560 --> 01:30:16.680
Longinus?

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:32.760
You call for me, Caesar?

01:30:36.720 --> 01:30:38.160
My will.

01:30:44.680 --> 01:30:47.640
Here with to my beloved Drusilla...

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:52.480
...the Roman Empire...

01:30:54.640 --> 01:30:57.880
...title of Augusta...

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.200
...my little boots.

01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:15.560
Little boo...

01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:22.120
He's sleepy.

01:31:24.560 --> 01:31:26.360
No, he's not.

01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.840
Drusilla.

01:31:51.200 --> 01:31:53.640
Why do I get angry with you?

01:31:54.480 --> 01:31:56.080
Why do we always argue?

01:31:56.840 --> 01:31:58.400
You can't help it.

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.840
We'll never quarrel again.

01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.400
Oh, yes, we will.

01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:08.600
Don't let me die.

01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:24.880
My lady! You must not touch him!
The fever is contagious!

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:30.280
Sleep! You're safe now.
Drusilla's here.

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:39.720
I offer my life,
if Jupiter will only spare our beloved Emperor.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:47.320
- Jupiter accepts your offer.
- Hmm?

01:32:47.760 --> 01:32:48.920
Execute him.

01:32:58.160 --> 01:32:59.960
The fever is breaking.

01:33:01.040 --> 01:33:04.360
Do you hear that, Little Boots?
You're going to live.

01:33:09.400 --> 01:33:13.360
Drusilla tells me that I've been neglecting my work. 
So I recalled for duty.

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:16.640
Your signature
and seal is required, lord!

01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:26.600
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name
of the Senate and the people of Rome.

01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:38.760
I, Caligula Caesar,
command in the name of the...

01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:41.720
...Senate... and...

01:33:44.040 --> 01:33:45.560
...people of Rome.

01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:52.520
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name
of the Senate and the people of Rome.

01:33:53.520 --> 01:33:56.040
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name
of the Senate and the people of Rome.

01:33:56.360 --> 01:33:58.080
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name
of the Senate and the people of Rome.

01:33:58.120 --> 01:33:59.680
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name
of the Senate and the people of Rome.

01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:01.060
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name
of the Senate and the people of Rome.

01:34:01.095 --> 01:34:02.400
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name
of the Senate and the people of Rome.

01:34:02.520 --> 01:34:05.800
Rome, Rome, Caesar, Caesar,
Rome, Rome, rubbish, rubbish, rubbish!

01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:16.960
I, Caligula Caesar, command in the name
of the Senate and the people of Rome.

01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:26.640
- No wonder life's so dull.
- Yes, lord... oh... no, lord... and don't...

01:34:27.240 --> 01:34:30.080
Let's see if Proculus
can liven things up for us!

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:41.080
Proculus!

01:34:52.760 --> 01:34:55.560
Do you know that his wife is
expecting her first child?

01:34:55.760 --> 01:34:58.040
We're not quite sure
who the father is.

01:34:58.280 --> 01:35:01.280
Him or... God.

01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:08.920
Divine Caesar, please! What have I done?
Why am I here?

01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:13.240
- Treason.
- I've always been loyal to you.

01:35:13.640 --> 01:35:15.800
That is your treason.

01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:19.440
You're an honest man, Proculus,
which means of bad Roman.

01:35:19.800 --> 01:35:21.440
Therefore you're a traitor.

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:23.640
Logical, hmm?

01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:38.760
Now you must die like Gemellus.

01:35:39.760 --> 01:35:42.440
Like all moles failed Rome.

01:36:00.360 --> 01:36:04.120
Now slowly, very slowly.

01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:10.200
I want him to feel death.
I want him to smell death.

01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:24.160
Now! What does it feel like, Proculus?

01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:27.600
Can you see the great goddess Isis?

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.360
What does she say?

01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:36.520
Reptile!

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:39.360
Make a note of this.

01:36:56.080 --> 01:36:58.760
I said slowly, you fool!

01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:21.400
Lucky boy!
To off escaped me so easily.

01:37:39.240 --> 01:37:42.360
Longinus! Reptile!

01:37:42.880 --> 01:37:44.880
Cut off those and send them to Livia...

01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:48.560
...as a souvenir of their great love.

01:38:05.920 --> 01:38:08.600
Caesar says, "Cut them off!"

01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.920
And now send the rest to Livia.

01:39:07.400 --> 01:39:08.720
Curtain!

01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:27.525
Child's head...

01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:28.840
...has just appeared.

01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:37.720
- Is he alive?
- Yes, Caesar.

01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:46.160
My lords!
I'm now to be married to Caesonia.

01:39:46.720 --> 01:39:50.720
The mother of my son,
Caligula Germanicus!

01:39:58.760 --> 01:40:01.200
Caligula! Caesonia!

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.240
Ring, ring! Give me the ring!

01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:25.160
You are now wife, mother
and emperess of Rome.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:28.400
It's a girl.

01:40:31.120 --> 01:40:32.400
It's a girl.

01:40:33.120 --> 01:40:36.640
It is not a girl.
Did you not hear Caesar say?

01:40:36.720 --> 01:40:40.200
I heard the voice of Caesar,
but your daughter did not.

01:40:49.720 --> 01:40:53.000
- I should've waited, shouldn't I?
- There will be other children.

01:41:03.360 --> 01:41:05.440
- Longinus.
- Caesar?

01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:11.000
One month of free games
and a gold coin to every Roman...

01:41:11.600 --> 01:41:15.040
...to celebrate the birth of my son.

01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:22.160
My son... Julia Drusilla!

01:41:22.200 --> 01:41:25.000
Julia Drusilla!

01:41:25.035 --> 01:41:26.080
Drusilla?

01:41:32.840 --> 01:41:34.240
Drusilla!

01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:36.920
- The fever!
- Drusilla!

01:41:38.280 --> 01:41:39.360
The fever!

01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:09.880
Drusilla!

01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.805
I'm here...

01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:15.800
...it's your Little Boots!

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.720
It's your Little Boots!

01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:30.160
Do something.

01:42:30.320 --> 01:42:33.240
I am doing everything I...
I can, Caesar.

01:42:33.680 --> 01:42:37.040
I swear!
But the fever must take its course.

01:42:55.360 --> 01:42:58.200
Great Isis! Save her!

01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:01.040
Take me!

01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:05.720
Caesar begs you,
o mighty goddess!

01:43:10.640 --> 01:43:11.720
Caesar!

01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:45.760
Drusilla?

01:44:56.520 --> 01:45:00.600
Get out! Get out!
Go on! Get out! Get out!

01:45:00.840 --> 01:45:05.440
Get out! Go on!
Out! Out! Out!

01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:18.440
Drusilla!

01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:27.560
Almighty mother...

01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:32.920
You...

01:45:42.600 --> 01:45:44.240
I begged you...

01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:49.240
Caesar begs you...

01:49:25.760 --> 01:49:31.560
<i>We, Caius Caesar Caligula, do decree
one month puclic mourning...</i>

01:49:31.600 --> 01:49:34.400
<i>...for our beloved sister, Drusilla.</i>

01:49:35.000 --> 01:49:40.240
<i>During which time anyone who laughs,
baths, dines with his parents or children...</i>

01:49:40.360 --> 01:49:43.440
<i>...or has intercourse
will be sentenced to death.</i>

01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:47.040
<i>Such as the will of the Senate
and the people of Rome.</i>

01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:05.600
Hello!

01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:31.200
Come on, darling!

01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:48.680
Caligula has finished!

01:50:49.680 --> 01:50:54.960
Nestor restores the imperial heirs.

01:50:58.240 --> 01:51:01.400
The slaves of Rome!

01:51:12.520 --> 01:51:14.400
The people!

01:51:22.800 --> 01:51:26.240
The army!

01:51:30.560 --> 01:51:34.720
The tribune of the people!

01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:47.200
The Senate!

01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:16.960
And great and supreme...
the Emperor!

01:52:25.240 --> 01:52:26.360
Hail!

01:52:27.240 --> 01:52:35.840
And I am...
the lady Drusilla, his sister!

01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:44.640
Let's make love once again,
brother Nestor!

01:52:45.320 --> 01:52:47.720
No! No!

01:52:48.040 --> 01:52:49.120
Stop!

01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:51.000
Stop!

01:52:53.400 --> 01:52:55.360
No! Stop!

01:53:45.120 --> 01:53:46.200
Another drunk.

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:26.880
Do you have any news of him?

01:54:36.600 --> 01:54:41.400
According to one report,
he's gone to Egypt.

01:54:43.040 --> 01:54:45.480
And according to the other reports?

01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:47.240
Well...

01:54:48.120 --> 01:54:49.640
...to Greece...

01:54:49.920 --> 01:54:51.760
...another, Persia...

01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:56.880
...to Carthage
and another again, to Gal.

01:54:58.760 --> 01:55:01.480
And where do you think he is?

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:05.680
- He could be anywhere.
- No.

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:07.680
He's here in Rome.

01:55:08.800 --> 01:55:10.000
He's testing us.

01:58:02.520 --> 01:58:04.000
Get off!

01:58:07.480 --> 01:58:12.800
I have existed from the morning of the world,
and I shall exist until the last star falls from the night.

01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:17.600
Although I have taken the form of
Gaius Caligula, I am all men as I am no man.

01:58:17.760 --> 01:58:19.680
Therefore I am...

01:58:21.440 --> 01:58:23.120
...a god.

01:58:35.040 --> 01:58:39.120
I shall wait for the unanimous
decision of the Senate.

01:58:39.800 --> 01:58:42.000
All those who say aye...

01:58:42.520 --> 01:58:44.120
...say "Aye!"

01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:49.880
Aye!

01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:53.165
Aye!

01:58:53.200 --> 01:58:54.360
- Aye!
- Aye!

01:58:54.395 --> 01:58:57.277
- Aye!
- Aye!

01:58:57.312 --> 01:58:59.996
Aye! Aye! Aye!

01:59:00.031 --> 01:59:02.680
Aye! Aye! Aye!

01:59:02.920 --> 01:59:04.520
He's a god now.

01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:09.640
Aye! Aye! Aye!

01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:11.480
Baa!

01:59:11.720 --> 01:59:14.280
- Baa!
- Baa!

01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:16.880
- Baa!
- Baa!

01:59:17.120 --> 01:59:19.200
- Baa!
- Baa!

01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:21.040
- Baa!
- Baa!

01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:23.120
- Baa!
- Baa!

01:59:23.240 --> 01:59:25.320
- Baa!
- Baa!

01:59:25.355 --> 01:59:27.257
- Baa!
- Baa!

01:59:27.292 --> 01:59:29.026
- Baa!
- Baa!

01:59:29.061 --> 01:59:30.760
- Baa!
- Baa!

01:59:30.960 --> 01:59:35.480
The period of mourning is now over.

01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:36.880
He's mad!

02:00:00.560 --> 02:00:02.680
Enjoy yourself.

02:00:03.200 --> 02:00:04.640
Take care.

02:00:20.120 --> 02:00:22.640
Now the fun begins.

02:00:23.160 --> 02:00:25.760
But... ah...
are you going to enjoy it as well?

02:00:25.795 --> 02:00:28.120
I don't know.
Should we ask them?

02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:29.520
Longinus!

02:00:35.200 --> 02:00:38.560
Ah, Longinus!
My financial wizard.

02:00:39.400 --> 02:00:41.320
We have a question for you.

02:00:42.240 --> 02:00:44.320
Who're the richest men in Rome?

02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:45.880
Who?

02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:50.520
Answer: The pimps.

02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:52.240
Question number two.

02:00:53.320 --> 02:00:57.600
Who are the most lascivious sluts
in all of Rome?

02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:01.280
Who?

02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:06.560
Answer: The senators' wives.

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:13.000
So, an imperial brothel. A most logical
way to balance the state budget.

02:01:50.200 --> 02:01:54.000
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen,
we have gone to great expence...

02:01:54.035 --> 02:01:57.000
...to bring you the finest flesh
in our empire.

02:02:06.400 --> 02:02:08.200
Five gold pieces!

02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:14.640
Only five gold pieces for each
and every twenty minutes!

02:02:15.600 --> 02:02:17.360
And that's a bargain!

02:02:33.720 --> 02:02:37.000
Look at them!
Aren't they beautiful?

02:02:47.640 --> 02:02:51.600
The most lascivious ladies of the
Roman Empire have come today...

02:02:51.635 --> 02:02:54.680
...to perform their patriotic
beauties for all.

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:58.080
For a mere five gold pieces.

02:02:58.240 --> 02:03:01.720
All with them,
that they will welcome you well.

02:03:03.640 --> 02:03:05.960
Follow for all the imperial bungalow...

02:03:06.440 --> 02:03:09.960
...and better make your choice of the
finest treasure of the Empire.

02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:17.520
Just five gold pieces for each
and every twenty minutes.

02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:22.320
And that's a bargain, because most of the
women here are respectable, married ladies.

02:03:23.040 --> 02:03:27.440
Senators' wives.
Whores of plainest reputation.

02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:32.360
I'll have to work out a special
rate for you.

02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:40.845
Greetings!
Flavia, come!

02:03:40.880 --> 02:03:45.640
Don't waste time! Our senators'
wives are not merely beautiful...

02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:49.000
...like their husbands,
they are insensible.

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:53.760
And for only five gold pieces,
took any one of you.

02:04:25.640 --> 02:04:29.060
Do the wives of golden juice
come on you!

02:04:29.095 --> 02:04:32.480
Take their wives, use them,
confuse them.

02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:34.120
Do as you will with them.

02:04:34.560 --> 02:04:41.040
They are yours. Just yours for only five.
Five gold pieces.

02:04:44.160 --> 02:04:45.560
Hairy nipples!

02:04:48.960 --> 02:04:54.080
Senator Marcellus!
Your wife will scare our customers away.

02:04:55.360 --> 02:04:56.960
Try help walnuts.

02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:01.320
Hey, you over there!
Don't pinch yourself.

02:05:01.440 --> 02:05:04.960
The more that you give,
the more they will bite you.

02:05:37.000 --> 02:05:41.120
How many enjoying the skills
perfected by our senators' ladies...

02:05:41.200 --> 02:05:44.400
...while their husbands left in the Senate?

02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:19.800
Only five gold pieces!

02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:21.080
Five!

02:06:22.360 --> 02:06:23.925
Senators' wives...

02:06:23.960 --> 02:06:26.960
...for a blameless reputation!

02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:50.200
He's making customs using
all our wives and daughters.

02:06:50.960 --> 02:06:53.000
Humaliating the Senate
and defending the army.

02:06:53.400 --> 02:06:55.040
That's why the people love him.

02:07:08.280 --> 02:07:12.000
Longinus! You're not having any fun!
Enjoy yourself!

02:07:12.400 --> 02:07:16.320
- What is your preference?
- Everything and nothing, Caesar.

02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:20.400
You can't have both
for the same price.

02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:31.720
- He's provoking you.
- Only me? Huh!

02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:34.280
He's mad!
He doesn't know what he's doing.

02:07:35.920 --> 02:07:37.960
He knows what he's doing
perfectly well.

02:07:39.840 --> 02:07:43.080
- Give him enough rope... perhaps...
- He'll hang us all!

02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:26.880
We also have a few
very sappier ladies here today.

02:08:27.240 --> 02:08:30.600
You may slash them
or may bind them.

02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:33.640
Five gold pieces to buy you both!

02:08:34.480 --> 02:08:36.840
For five gold pieces!

02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:13.960
Can't you stop bothering
for just a few moments?

02:09:15.680 --> 02:09:16.680
Chaerea!

02:09:16.880 --> 02:09:19.440
I hear you have a taste for little boys.

02:09:19.800 --> 02:09:22.320
- Is that not so?
- No, Caesar! Big boys.

02:09:23.800 --> 02:09:26.200
- My soldiers.
- Are they ready?

02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:27.720
Yes, Caesar.

02:09:28.200 --> 02:09:29.640
Perfect!

02:09:40.400 --> 02:09:42.800
We sail for Britain!

02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:34.640
He will not go again!

02:11:59.080 --> 02:12:02.440
We're only a few
has marched from Rome.

02:12:03.400 --> 02:12:05.360
And what new madness is this?

02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:11.960
Mars tells me we will
enjoy a great victory.

02:12:17.520 --> 02:12:19.720
- Ah, Chaerea!
- Caesar?

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:23.240
Are we prepared for the invasion?

02:12:24.120 --> 02:12:25.600
Yes, Caesar...

02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:28.120
...only...

02:12:28.400 --> 02:12:29.800
Only what?

02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:34.080
- Where is Britain?
- Where?

02:12:35.480 --> 02:12:36.800
There.

02:12:37.720 --> 02:12:39.800
Ah, yes, lord, there...

02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:43.600
...but... eh...
there is no enemy.

02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:47.080
There is papyrus cane.

02:12:47.800 --> 02:12:51.120
- Papyrus cane, Divine Caesar?
- Yes, papyrus.

02:12:51.200 --> 02:12:53.200
Don't be so stupid, Chaerea!

02:12:53.640 --> 02:12:57.080
Order my army to attack
and destroy that papyrus.

02:12:57.760 --> 02:12:59.080
Yes, lord.

02:13:03.440 --> 02:13:07.080
After all, we must have some proof
that I have conquered Britain.

02:13:23.640 --> 02:13:24.640
War!

02:14:18.520 --> 02:14:19.880
Kill!

02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:44.560
While all of you were
living safely here in Rome...

02:14:44.600 --> 02:14:47.200
...your beloved emperor
was risking his life...

02:14:47.240 --> 02:14:50.280
...to preserve and enlarge the Empire.

02:14:56.680 --> 02:15:00.680
I've heard rumors that the Senate
doesn't believe that I ever went to Britain.

02:15:01.040 --> 02:15:03.120
No! No, lord!

02:15:03.320 --> 02:15:08.800
But I did conquer Britain, and I have a hundred
thousand papyrus canes to prove it!

02:15:12.320 --> 02:15:15.765
- Hail, Caligula Caesar!
- Hail, Caesar!

02:15:15.800 --> 02:15:20.600
- Hail, Caligula the Conquerer!
- Hail! Hail! Hail!

02:15:21.520 --> 02:15:24.240
Better be careful,
he's in a strange mood tonight.

02:15:36.080 --> 02:15:37.280
Caligula!

02:15:38.320 --> 02:15:42.960
- They hate you now.
- Let them hate me. So long as they fear me.

02:15:42.995 --> 02:15:46.520
They are senators and consuls.
They are important men.

02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:49.000
So important that they prove all I do?

02:15:49.400 --> 02:15:50.720
They must be mad.

02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:52.680
I don't know what else to do
to revolt them.

02:15:52.715 --> 02:15:54.277
<i>Great victory!</i>

02:15:54.312 --> 02:15:55.840
<i>In Britain!</i>

02:15:58.200 --> 02:15:59.360
<i>And now...</i>

02:16:00.280 --> 02:16:04.720
<i>...the booties captured
during this great campaign.</i>

02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:08.000
<i>Fish.</i>

02:16:09.800 --> 02:16:12.960
<i>Mullet, blenny and salmon.</i>

02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:15.840
<i>Oysters...</i>

02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:20.160
<i>...and beautiful pink pearls.</i>

02:16:20.600 --> 02:16:25.720
<i>From the blue seas
and silver rivers of Britain.</i>

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:35.480
<i>Gained from the green forests
and golden holms of Britain...</i>

02:16:36.240 --> 02:16:40.280
<i>...swell pheasants, lovesome geese.</i>

02:17:06.440 --> 02:17:07.920
Cowards.

02:17:13.160 --> 02:17:16.360
Crawl! Crawl! Crawl!

02:17:16.879 --> 02:17:19.520
I hate them!

02:17:26.000 --> 02:17:27.959
Almighty Caesar says...

02:17:28.600 --> 02:17:30.639
...to balance the state budget...

02:17:30.760 --> 02:17:35.680
...we shall confiscate the entire estates
of all those who have failed Rome.

02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:42.719
Read out your list, Longinus.

02:17:44.639 --> 02:17:53.959
Senators Galva, Aponius, Marcellus,
Antonius, Cassius...

02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:55.400
Chaerea!

02:17:55.719 --> 02:17:58.480
They have failed me.
Arrest them.

02:17:58.680 --> 02:18:00.000
...Lepidus...

02:18:01.559 --> 02:18:04.480
...Sextus and Octavius.

02:18:04.600 --> 02:18:05.879
Guards! Arrest them!

02:18:22.600 --> 02:18:24.320
Almighty Caesar says...

02:18:24.719 --> 02:18:26.080
...finish your dinner.

02:18:29.040 --> 02:18:30.600
Eat!

02:18:37.639 --> 02:18:39.040
He must be done soon.

02:18:44.360 --> 02:18:47.360
- Watch Chaerea!
- Why?

02:18:47.639 --> 02:18:49.240
The omens are not good.

02:18:49.879 --> 02:18:51.320
Be on your guard.

02:18:53.400 --> 02:18:55.920
I think he intends to kill me.

02:19:00.680 --> 02:19:02.280
What is amusing, Caesar?

02:19:03.559 --> 02:19:04.559
Just a thought.

02:19:05.000 --> 02:19:07.280
May I ask what thought?

02:19:11.320 --> 02:19:14.160
Is it true that there is a conspiracy
against me, Longinus?

02:19:14.240 --> 02:19:17.120
Eh... well, lord... that is... I mean...

02:19:17.840 --> 02:19:20.160
It seems there is a secret plot.

02:19:20.320 --> 02:19:22.680
A plot is always a secret, if it's not a secret,
not a plot or a plan.

02:19:22.799 --> 02:19:24.400
That is logical, is it not, Claudius?

02:19:24.920 --> 02:19:26.879
Even a half-wit can know that
and you are a half-wit.

02:19:27.000 --> 02:19:28.840
Half of me is, Caesar.

02:19:31.920 --> 02:19:33.805
The situation's gone too far.

02:19:33.840 --> 02:19:37.799
He's muffed the guards, overruled the
government and insulted the best friends of Rome.

02:19:38.000 --> 02:19:40.440
Yes, the Senate counts for
nothing anymore.

02:19:40.475 --> 02:19:41.885
No one is safe from him.

02:19:41.920 --> 02:19:45.000
- He's a tyrant.
- Then what can we do?

02:19:45.080 --> 02:19:47.080
There's only one solution.

02:19:48.440 --> 02:19:51.720
- If Caligula ought to die...
- It could happen.

02:20:51.720 --> 02:20:53.240
You need to sleep.

02:20:54.120 --> 02:20:57.400
I think I shall resign myself
to living forever.

02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:00.160
I hope you do.

02:21:17.880 --> 02:21:19.720
I am going bald.

02:21:23.080 --> 02:21:24.640
No, you're not.

02:21:25.080 --> 02:21:27.480
You've never been able
to face the facts, have you?

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:33.040
The facts? Yes, my lord.
Can you?

02:21:41.040 --> 02:21:44.120
I need some sleep.

02:21:47.240 --> 02:21:48.920
I need you.

02:22:15.840 --> 02:22:17.840
Psst! Are you ready?

02:22:18.320 --> 02:22:21.200
Will you speak your lying sister Isis?

02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:27.400
Long have I wondered
in the land of men...

02:22:27.680 --> 02:22:31.520
...in search of you, brother Osiris.

02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:42.240
I have been killed
and cut in two bits.

02:22:44.120 --> 02:22:50.040
You put my pieces together,
bringing back life...

02:22:50.440 --> 02:22:52.200
...with a kiss.

02:22:54.000 --> 02:22:55.760
There goes our blood.

02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:03.320
It doesn't matter.
It's only a show.

02:23:13.880 --> 02:23:17.280
- I can't get it right.
- No, Caesar! Look, like that.

02:23:21.640 --> 02:23:23.080
Hello, precious!

02:23:27.400 --> 02:23:28.960
Have you been a good girl?

02:23:36.680 --> 02:23:39.045
Don't you think she looks
beautiful in my costume?

02:23:39.080 --> 02:23:41.160
- She's even wearing my little boots.
- Cause you like her power.

02:23:41.195 --> 02:23:44.600
My little... boots!

02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:07.760
She's serious.

02:24:13.880 --> 02:24:15.880
Going to be dressed like you today.

02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:46.440
Password?

02:24:47.960 --> 02:24:49.000
Scotch him!

02:24:49.080 --> 02:24:50.360
So be it!

02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:33.680
I'll...

02:25:34.600 --> 02:25:36.160
...live...

02:25:37.280 --> 02:25:38.720
...live...

02:26:31.600 --> 02:26:32.400
Come on!

02:26:36.200 --> 02:26:38.645
Hail, Claudius Caesar!

02:26:38.680 --> 02:26:41.400
- Hail, Claudius Caesar!
- Hail, Claudius!

02:26:41.435 --> 02:26:45.280
- Hail, Claudius!
- Claudius, hail!

02:26:47.480 --> 02:26:50.280
Hail, Claudius Caesar!

02:26:50.880 --> 02:26:51.920
Hail!

02:26:52.305 --> 02:26:58.532
