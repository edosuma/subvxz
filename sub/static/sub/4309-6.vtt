00:00.508 --> 00:02.472
Previously on Rectify:

00:04.569 --> 00:06.693
My period's late.

00:09.448 --> 00:12.035
I was passed out from the
choke hold he put on me.

00:12.036 --> 00:14.524
You think I'd let him pull my pants
down if I'd have been awake?

00:14.525 --> 00:15.728
No, no. Of course not.

00:15.729 --> 00:18.094
If you tell anybody about this, Carl...
I swear to God.

00:18.095 --> 00:19.909
So, you'd let him plea out of it...

00:19.910 --> 00:21.172
Give me another option, Roland,

00:21.173 --> 00:23.022
one that saves both of us.

00:23.023 --> 00:24.320
For later on.

00:24.321 --> 00:25.807
Are they shrooms?

00:25.808 --> 00:27.816
You already know what to do, Daniel.

00:27.817 --> 00:30.054
Just got to remember it.

01:11.959 --> 01:14.361
Mom, what's for lunch? I'm hungry.

01:14.395 --> 01:16.262
Honey, don't come out here.

01:16.297 --> 01:18.031
I told you... Stay in your room.

01:26.407 --> 01:27.641
Oh.

01:27.675 --> 01:28.775
Sorry.

01:28.809 --> 01:30.810
I'm sorry.

01:30.845 --> 01:33.346
I'm not used to knocking on my own door.

01:34.649 --> 01:38.018
That's okay.

01:53.267 --> 01:56.569
Did I hear a child's voice?

01:58.072 --> 01:59.906
His dad just dropped him by.

01:59.940 --> 02:01.307
I get him on weekends.

02:04.578 --> 02:06.913
Is monarch bothering you?

02:06.947 --> 02:10.050
No. He's... he's... he's fine.

02:12.920 --> 02:15.422
Hmm.

02:15.456 --> 02:18.391
So, you know, uh, Lezley?

02:18.426 --> 02:21.828
Everybody knows Lezley...

02:21.862 --> 02:24.864
Whether they want to admit it or not.

02:24.899 --> 02:28.601
You staying over there now?

02:28.636 --> 02:30.870
No. I...

02:30.905 --> 02:34.874
I just went over there
the other night and...

02:34.909 --> 02:36.943
Never left.

02:36.977 --> 02:39.045
I used to go there a
lot when I was younger.

02:39.080 --> 02:40.680
It's like a rite of passage.

02:40.715 --> 02:43.783
So that's what that was.

02:43.818 --> 02:46.286
Mm.

02:46.320 --> 02:49.355
You can finish your beer, Daniel.

02:49.390 --> 02:50.690
Take as long as you like.

02:50.725 --> 02:52.792
The door, it'll lock behind you.

02:52.827 --> 02:55.295
I'll just take it with me.

02:55.329 --> 02:57.931
It's...

02:57.965 --> 02:59.899
Daniel.

02:59.934 --> 03:02.268
Yes?

03:02.303 --> 03:05.438
Be careful.

03:09.343 --> 03:11.044
Was it me,

03:11.078 --> 03:13.947
or could it have been anybody last night?

03:19.520 --> 03:22.555
Sometimes...

03:22.590 --> 03:24.924
I do things I don't have a good answer for.

03:27.928 --> 03:30.463
I understand.

04:54.782 --> 04:57.350
Daniel Holden.

04:59.253 --> 05:02.188
As free as the wind blows.

05:07.061 --> 05:09.295
Feels real, don't it?

05:31.619 --> 05:34.287
Fixing to warm up.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.658
It's good for catfish.

05:53.107 --> 05:57.076
I don't think I need to know
how many weeks it was, Teddy.

05:57.111 --> 05:58.611
I was there with you.

05:58.646 --> 06:00.647
Oh, I-I know. I just...

06:00.681 --> 06:02.615
I just thought it was interesting

06:02.650 --> 06:05.318
you could pee on a stick now, and
they'd tell you all that. That's all.

06:05.352 --> 06:06.753
I mean, one day it'll be able to tell you

06:06.787 --> 06:08.067
if it's a boy or girl, you know?

06:09.456 --> 06:13.726
I don't think I want to
know all that at once.

06:13.761 --> 06:17.196
It's been three minutes.

06:18.866 --> 06:21.501
I can't look.

06:29.209 --> 06:30.443
Oh, my God.

06:30.477 --> 06:33.346
- What?
- You're pregnant.

06:35.349 --> 06:36.582
Really?

06:36.617 --> 06:38.518
Says more than five weeks.

06:40.154 --> 06:42.155
Oh, my God!

06:42.189 --> 06:44.424
- Can I say this right now?
- What?

06:44.458 --> 06:45.792
You got a bun in the oven right there.

06:45.826 --> 06:47.694
No. You can't say that.

06:47.728 --> 06:48.962
All right. How about this?

06:48.996 --> 06:50.263
How about... How about "we're pregnant"?

06:50.297 --> 06:51.497
No.

06:53.667 --> 06:55.935
How about...

06:55.970 --> 06:58.471
"You're pregnant," Tawney Talbot?

06:58.505 --> 07:01.107
You're pregnant.

07:01.141 --> 07:03.876
I guess I am.

07:03.911 --> 07:06.212
♪ Ain't no lie, can't deny ♪

07:06.246 --> 07:08.047
♪ Ain't no lie, can't deny ♪

07:08.082 --> 07:09.849
♪ Ain't no lie, can't deny ♪

07:09.883 --> 07:11.117
♪ Ain't no lie ♪

07:11.151 --> 07:12.552
Can't deny.

07:24.732 --> 07:26.866
I prayed about this.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.901
You did?

07:32.673 --> 07:35.675
I just prayed that God's
will be done, you know?

07:35.709 --> 07:39.512
And that's all I knew to
do... His will be done.

07:39.546 --> 07:41.647
And you're pregnant.

07:42.716 --> 07:44.317
By God, you're pregnant.

07:45.619 --> 07:47.887
I am, Teddy.

07:47.921 --> 07:49.288
With your baby.

07:56.096 --> 07:57.397
Teddy?

07:57.431 --> 07:59.098
Yeah, Tawney?

07:59.133 --> 08:01.534
It's still early.

08:01.568 --> 08:03.336
I know. I know.

08:03.370 --> 08:06.339
Can we keep it a secret?

08:06.373 --> 08:09.042
Enjoy it for a little
while, just you and me?

08:27.928 --> 08:30.096
You ain't gonna believe it.

08:30.130 --> 08:32.030
Another one fell.

08:32.066 --> 08:35.368
Another one?

08:35.402 --> 08:37.770
Different tree.

09:01.462 --> 09:02.762
I'm sorry.

09:02.796 --> 09:04.564
I lost track of time.

09:04.598 --> 09:07.767
Three days, Daniel.

09:07.801 --> 09:10.269
I thought I left you a message.

09:10.304 --> 09:12.071
That was Thursday morning.

09:12.106 --> 09:13.673
Right.

09:13.707 --> 09:15.842
Ted and I had to drive around
last night looking for you.

09:15.876 --> 09:17.310
I'm sorry.

09:17.344 --> 09:19.745
I-I almost called the sheriff.

09:19.780 --> 09:21.614
I really didn't want to do that.

09:23.550 --> 09:26.085
I know you're not a
teenager, Daniel, but...

09:26.120 --> 09:28.754
But you're also not...

09:28.789 --> 09:29.889
Normal.

09:40.334 --> 09:42.335
Your life hasn't been normal,

09:42.369 --> 09:43.970
so how could you expect to be?

09:44.004 --> 09:47.840
Like, I just want to know where you are.

09:47.875 --> 09:49.308
All right, sweetheart?

09:49.343 --> 09:51.477
Of course.

09:51.512 --> 09:54.313
I-I have to go.

09:54.348 --> 09:55.882
I have to get ready.

09:55.916 --> 09:57.483
For what?

09:57.518 --> 10:01.954
I thought I would go
to Mr. Gaines' funeral.

10:01.989 --> 10:04.123
That's...

10:04.158 --> 10:06.459
Thoughtful.

10:06.493 --> 10:08.127
Um...

10:08.162 --> 10:10.463
I'll do some work when I get back.

10:10.497 --> 10:13.900
So, you're coming home,
then, and staying for a while?

10:13.934 --> 10:16.169
I plan to, yes.

10:22.042 --> 10:25.511
I need to borrow some...
Some money for some things.

10:27.080 --> 10:28.314
How much?

10:28.348 --> 10:32.418
$50 will be okay.

10:36.089 --> 10:39.225
I'll pay you back when I get a job.

10:41.428 --> 10:43.362
I'm not worried.

10:43.397 --> 10:45.831
And once I start working,

10:45.866 --> 10:50.736
I-I-I might even buy an
old beater truck or...

10:50.771 --> 10:53.472
I could see you in one of those.

10:57.411 --> 11:00.012
Yeah.

11:00.047 --> 11:03.216
How... how are you gonna get there?

11:03.250 --> 11:05.117
Oh, uh...

11:05.152 --> 11:06.519
I thought I'd walk.

11:06.553 --> 11:08.187
Take the car.

11:08.222 --> 11:10.590
I don't want to keep
taking your car, Mother.

11:10.624 --> 11:12.592
I don't want you to walk, Daniel.

11:12.626 --> 11:13.893
Please.

11:18.799 --> 11:20.933
Be careful.

11:26.640 --> 11:30.209
Rutherford was a good friend.

11:30.244 --> 11:32.144
Had a sharp mind.

11:32.179 --> 11:34.480
He played a spirited game of bridge.

11:34.514 --> 11:36.115
Wasn't much on the golf course.

11:36.149 --> 11:39.151
He just kind of did that
out of obligation or penance.

11:41.255 --> 11:44.423
I know that he was a great father.

11:44.458 --> 11:47.193
We'll miss him.

11:57.437 --> 12:00.506
Holy mother of God.

12:04.544 --> 12:08.180
I-I'm not sure if it's appropriate for...

12:08.215 --> 12:10.283
For me to say something or not.

12:10.317 --> 12:15.254
The irony of it doesn't
escape me, of course.

12:15.289 --> 12:17.456
Anyway, uh...

12:17.491 --> 12:22.528
Mr. Gaines used to send
me books when I was away.

12:22.562 --> 12:25.431
Three books on the French revolution alone.

12:25.465 --> 12:29.969
He liked revolutions, I
guess, especially failed ones.

12:31.872 --> 12:34.106
I discovered a theme running
through those books...

12:34.141 --> 12:36.542
That men will see what they want to see

12:36.576 --> 12:40.046
and believe what they want to believe

12:40.080 --> 12:42.448
and fight to the death for those beliefs,

12:42.482 --> 12:44.950
no matter how misguided or hopeless.

12:44.985 --> 12:49.655
Oftentimes I would dream on these events,

12:49.690 --> 12:53.559
of the crowds taking the
streets, taking the squares,

12:53.593 --> 12:59.532
and the contagion of menacing fear,

12:59.566 --> 13:01.867
and mercy be damned.

13:01.902 --> 13:04.303
And occasionally, I would...

13:04.338 --> 13:10.242
I would see Mr. Gaines,
away from the crowd.

13:10.277 --> 13:14.013
Catch his eye and...

13:14.047 --> 13:16.048
Understand just how difficult it is

13:16.083 --> 13:19.218
for two people to come together

13:19.252 --> 13:23.889
in the face of such intoxicating lunacy.

13:23.924 --> 13:29.028
Truth is, I didn't
know Mr. Gaines.

13:30.430 --> 13:33.366
Not really.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.769
His notes that accompanied
the books were never personal.

13:36.803 --> 13:40.873
They just talked of the
subject matter at hand.

13:40.907 --> 13:43.275
At first I didn't care
if he sent them or not.

13:43.310 --> 13:45.845
I...

13:45.879 --> 13:48.180
But I read them.

13:48.215 --> 13:50.549
And he kept sending them.

13:50.584 --> 13:52.184
For 19 years.

13:52.219 --> 13:54.754
Like I said, I...

13:54.788 --> 13:58.391
I don't know why I'm here exactly.

14:00.227 --> 14:02.561
I suppose it might reason that...

14:05.298 --> 14:10.503
I dressed up for him because
on more than one occasion...

14:13.173 --> 14:15.074
He dressed up for me.

14:15.108 --> 14:17.443
Thank you.

14:23.116 --> 14:25.484
What the hell was that about?

14:25.519 --> 14:28.954
Gall. Pure gall.

14:28.989 --> 14:31.991
So, you think this plea
deal is gonna happen?

14:32.025 --> 14:33.893
I think she wants it to happen.

14:33.927 --> 14:35.828
Get it out of her hair.

14:35.862 --> 14:39.131
I never should have backed
that bitch in the first place.

14:39.166 --> 14:41.734
You think he'll take it?

14:41.768 --> 14:43.235
Holden? Shit.

14:43.270 --> 14:45.237
Who knows what he'll do?

14:45.272 --> 14:46.972
He let a man piss on him.

14:48.708 --> 14:52.111
Where is George goddamn Melton, Carl?

14:52.145 --> 14:55.381
Are you sure you want to find him?

14:58.885 --> 15:01.687
But you still see Holden as a threat.

15:01.721 --> 15:03.255
To who?

15:03.290 --> 15:04.690
The community.

15:04.724 --> 15:07.259
I wouldn't want to live next to him.

15:07.294 --> 15:08.494
Would you?

15:15.802 --> 15:17.636
You keeping secrets from me, Carl?

15:24.409 --> 15:26.944
Wildflowers and coffee.

15:26.979 --> 15:28.846
Jesus.

15:28.881 --> 15:31.082
Holden's creative. I'll give him that.

15:31.116 --> 15:34.018
Problem is, Ted Jr. won't press charges.

15:34.052 --> 15:37.054
Well, then we just got to
talk some sense into that boy.

15:37.089 --> 15:39.524
You got two choke-outs
and two sexual assaults.

15:39.558 --> 15:40.892
You think that's a coincidence?

15:40.926 --> 15:42.260
That's why I brought it up.

15:42.294 --> 15:44.028
It's modus operandi, Carl.

15:44.062 --> 15:45.696
It's a gift from the gods.

15:45.731 --> 15:48.232
It'll nip this plea-deal
nonsense in the bud.

15:50.335 --> 15:53.037
I discussed the legal side with Ted Jr.

15:53.071 --> 15:55.139
Said he doesn't want
the embarrassment of it.

15:55.174 --> 15:57.241
Felt pretty strong about it, too.

15:57.276 --> 15:59.243
I can't help his little feelings.

15:59.278 --> 16:02.313
The die was cast when Holden
shoved coffee beans up his ass.

16:02.347 --> 16:04.282
Hey. Refill, senator?

16:04.316 --> 16:06.951
What happened to calling me "sweetie"?

16:06.985 --> 16:09.120
Refill, sweetie?

16:09.154 --> 16:10.888
Attagirl.

16:12.357 --> 16:13.591
Mm-mm.

16:18.197 --> 16:20.064
It was grounds, Roland.

16:20.098 --> 16:22.934
- What?
- Not beans. Grounds.

16:22.968 --> 16:25.169
And Teddy said there
wasn't actual penetration.

16:25.204 --> 16:27.138
I don't give a good God damn.

16:27.172 --> 16:29.307
You tell me any backwoods prosecutor

16:29.341 --> 16:32.743
couldn't convince a jury
that that was the intent.

16:32.778 --> 16:35.146
He damn sure wasn't making
sand castles back there.

16:36.815 --> 16:39.016
We just got to get junior on the record.

16:39.051 --> 16:41.118
He ain't gonna like this.

16:41.153 --> 16:42.653
Not one bit.

16:42.688 --> 16:45.623
Well, this is bigger than him, Carl.

16:45.657 --> 16:48.492
This is bigger than all of us.

16:50.162 --> 16:54.365
You did the right thing telling me this.

16:54.399 --> 16:56.200
Don't go soft on me now.

17:04.910 --> 17:08.179
$60 on an $8 meal?

17:09.848 --> 17:11.549
You up for a little visit later?

17:11.583 --> 17:14.852
Got my son tonight, senator.

17:14.886 --> 17:18.689
You're messing with an old man's heart.

17:18.723 --> 17:21.692
That's why you keep coming back for more.

17:34.740 --> 17:36.807
Stop laughing.

17:36.842 --> 17:39.010
Just keep one foot in front of the other.

17:39.044 --> 17:40.311
Uh-oh.

17:40.345 --> 17:42.913
Jon.

17:42.948 --> 17:44.215
Jon.

17:44.249 --> 17:45.916
Okay.

17:49.054 --> 17:51.889
You've escaped death once again.

17:51.923 --> 17:53.991
It's in the family DNA.

17:54.026 --> 17:56.160
Holdens are invincible, huh?

17:57.429 --> 17:58.729
Superheroes.

17:58.764 --> 18:00.598
Men, bring your ladies close.

18:00.632 --> 18:02.433
It's time for a couples dance.

18:02.467 --> 18:05.236
I like you, Jon stern.

18:05.270 --> 18:08.406
Should we go steady?

18:08.440 --> 18:11.142
Why don't you shut up and kiss me?

18:14.079 --> 18:16.280
In front of all of Paulie?

18:19.818 --> 18:22.153
I don't care who sees us anymore.

18:32.964 --> 18:36.100
I can't believe you're about to leave.

18:36.134 --> 18:37.702
For a few days.

18:37.736 --> 18:39.537
Death row beckons?

18:39.571 --> 18:40.905
I'll be back.

18:40.939 --> 18:44.241
And then you'll leave again.

18:44.276 --> 18:47.111
Doesn't have to be this way.

18:48.814 --> 18:51.349
Do I at least get a parting gift?

18:58.123 --> 18:59.724
Excuse me.

18:59.758 --> 19:03.661
First your brother shows
up at Mr. Gaines' funeral

19:03.695 --> 19:05.629
rambling about God knows what,

19:05.664 --> 19:07.898
and now here you are acting like...

19:07.933 --> 19:09.900
I know you have to live your life.

19:09.935 --> 19:11.469
I understand that.

19:11.503 --> 19:14.605
I know it's not your fault,
the position you're in.

19:14.639 --> 19:17.842
But could you go do it
somewhere else, please?

19:17.876 --> 19:19.610
So that we don't have to think about Hanna

19:19.644 --> 19:21.779
and what happened to her that night?

19:23.648 --> 19:25.583
How old were you then?

19:25.617 --> 19:27.752
5?

19:27.786 --> 19:30.087
- Jon, please.
- No. Really.

19:30.122 --> 19:32.015
8?

19:32.016 --> 19:33.752
I was old enough.

19:33.753 --> 19:34.864
Old enough. For what?

19:34.865 --> 19:36.627
To listen to what your parents told you

19:36.661 --> 19:38.362
and believe it because
they said it was true?

19:38.397 --> 19:40.664
Afraid to think for yourself.

19:40.699 --> 19:42.032
Scared to look at all the facts.

19:42.067 --> 19:43.467
And for what?

19:43.502 --> 19:45.302
So you'd never have to admit to yourself

19:45.337 --> 19:46.971
that you might be wrong.

19:47.005 --> 19:51.809
Could you go do that somewhere else?

19:51.843 --> 19:53.177
Please.

19:56.848 --> 19:58.649
Good night.

19:58.683 --> 20:00.851
And good luck.

20:02.387 --> 20:04.021
Wow.

20:04.055 --> 20:06.724
Daniel was rambling at Gaines' funeral?

20:06.758 --> 20:09.827
I don't know.

20:09.861 --> 20:13.397
And here we are, living
it up at the skating rink.

20:13.432 --> 20:16.734
Not a care in the damn world.

20:19.104 --> 20:20.571
We should have known better.

20:20.605 --> 20:22.373
I should have known better.

20:22.407 --> 20:24.241
It's okay, Jon.

20:24.276 --> 20:27.645
I mean, screw her and
the minivan she came in.

20:27.679 --> 20:29.280
It's not her we should be worried about.

20:30.615 --> 20:32.683
That's right.

20:32.717 --> 20:34.585
Almost forgot for a second.

20:39.024 --> 20:40.991
Blue pill, white pill.

20:41.026 --> 20:43.327
Blue pill, white pill.

20:43.361 --> 20:47.832
Blue pill, white pill.

20:47.866 --> 20:49.533
Blue pill, white pill.

20:49.568 --> 20:51.368
Blue pill, white pill.

20:51.403 --> 20:53.404
Daniel?

20:53.438 --> 20:55.739
My name's Charlie.

20:55.774 --> 20:59.109
Did you call for me?

20:59.144 --> 21:02.213
I didn't call for you.

21:02.247 --> 21:04.915
I'm the chaplain.

21:04.950 --> 21:06.183
Praise God.

21:06.218 --> 21:07.718
What?

21:14.226 --> 21:16.560
Well...

21:16.595 --> 21:19.930
I'm here if you want to talk.

21:19.965 --> 21:21.932
I don't want to talk.

21:21.967 --> 21:25.035
You mind if I just sit here, then?

21:25.070 --> 21:27.471
I don't care what you do.

21:29.975 --> 21:34.311
Charlie the chaplain.

21:34.346 --> 21:37.448
Charlie chaplain.

21:39.918 --> 21:41.819
Took you long enough.

21:41.853 --> 21:45.055
I'm not as sharp as I used to be.

21:45.090 --> 21:47.324
Does that work better for you...

21:47.359 --> 21:50.261
Not being as sharp as you used to be?

21:52.964 --> 21:56.000
Shut up, Charlie chaplain.

21:56.034 --> 22:00.504
I'm not making a point.

22:00.539 --> 22:03.574
Just asking.

22:03.608 --> 22:06.677
I liked you better in the silent era.

22:15.161 --> 22:18.329
This kitchen is long overdue for a remodel.

22:18.364 --> 22:20.365
I know Mom's psyched.

22:20.399 --> 22:24.135
You're a sensitive person, Jared.

22:24.170 --> 22:25.403
It's a good trait.

22:36.916 --> 22:40.351
Mom said that the sheriff's department

22:40.386 --> 22:44.989
returned some of my
possessions from the, um...

22:45.024 --> 22:48.193
My walkman and other things.

22:48.227 --> 22:52.964
I found the other items, but
I-I didn't find my walkman.

23:01.273 --> 23:03.274
I'm sure it'll turn up.

23:05.878 --> 23:08.680
Well, that'll be Lezley with a "Z."

23:08.714 --> 23:10.348
Better go.

23:10.382 --> 23:12.383
Daniel.

23:12.418 --> 23:14.018
Yes, Jared?

23:14.053 --> 23:15.386
Well...

23:15.421 --> 23:18.289
Uh, d... You know what today is, right?

23:18.324 --> 23:22.594
The day of our dear mother's birth.

23:22.628 --> 23:24.763
2:00 is the party.

23:24.797 --> 23:27.899
I'll be there.

23:34.907 --> 23:37.742
Hanna was just a baby back then.

23:39.779 --> 23:43.214
I didn't think of her
that way at the time...

23:43.249 --> 23:46.818
I guess 'cause we were all just babies.

23:46.852 --> 23:51.055
It's good to be curious
about things, Jared...

23:51.090 --> 23:55.426
Especially when those
things are somehow taboo.

23:57.196 --> 24:01.800
You just got to be...

24:01.834 --> 24:03.501
Careful.

24:20.953 --> 24:23.688
Give me the money.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.627
Now, you get the microwave
and the Dinty Moore

24:29.662 --> 24:31.329
and let me do the talking.

24:42.808 --> 24:45.643
Tater, it's Lezley.

24:45.678 --> 24:46.978
Who?

24:47.012 --> 24:49.113
Lezley!

24:49.148 --> 24:50.348
Hold on a minute!

24:50.382 --> 24:51.783
I got to find my pants.

24:51.817 --> 24:53.818
I second that motion.

24:53.853 --> 24:55.386
Huh?!

24:55.421 --> 24:57.655
Wh... put your pants on!

25:01.427 --> 25:04.495
You brought my liquor, gypsy man.

25:04.530 --> 25:06.297
Johnnie Walker no less, tater.

25:06.332 --> 25:07.665
Uh-huh.

25:07.700 --> 25:10.001
All right. What else?

25:10.035 --> 25:13.671
A slightly used microwave oven.

25:13.706 --> 25:16.741
A case of Dinty Moore.

25:16.775 --> 25:18.977
And $50 cash.

25:19.011 --> 25:21.679
- $100 cash.
- $60.

25:21.714 --> 25:22.714
$75.

25:22.715 --> 25:25.250
$70?

25:28.754 --> 25:31.522
Okay. Deal.

25:41.133 --> 25:43.534
Thank you.

25:43.569 --> 25:45.236
You owe me $20.

25:47.573 --> 25:50.208
Ahh.

25:55.247 --> 25:57.248
What are you looking at?

26:04.490 --> 26:05.924
Go get the Dolly.

26:05.958 --> 26:08.359
This son of a bitch is gonna be heavy.

26:08.394 --> 26:10.762
I-I don't want to take this man's stuff.

26:10.796 --> 26:13.932
You feeling guilty?

26:13.966 --> 26:16.701
It's kind of a constant
refrain with you, ain't it?

26:16.735 --> 26:18.403
You might ought to look into that.

26:20.773 --> 26:22.540
Look, this stove ain't been used

26:22.574 --> 26:25.143
since tater's wife died eight years ago.

26:25.177 --> 26:28.479
Stove ain't nothing more than
a memory to him now, really.

26:28.514 --> 26:31.582
Might as well keep it up in
his head where memories belong.

26:31.617 --> 26:34.919
Have a microwave in the
kitchen he can actually use.

26:34.954 --> 26:37.121
I don't know.

26:37.156 --> 26:39.490
You don't know what?

26:39.525 --> 26:41.626
I don't know what to do.

26:41.660 --> 26:43.561
That's 'cause you're stuck, Daniel.

26:43.595 --> 26:44.996
Surprised you ain't dead.

26:46.799 --> 26:49.400
You're full of shit, Lezley.

26:49.435 --> 26:51.736
At least I'm okay with it.

26:51.770 --> 26:53.671
You okay with what you are?

26:55.174 --> 26:57.275
Now either go get the Dolly

26:57.309 --> 27:00.979
or pry that bottle of
scotch from tater's mitts.

27:01.013 --> 27:03.014
I don't give a shit either way.

27:10.789 --> 27:13.024
Mom, please let me frost the cake.

27:13.058 --> 27:14.959
- I can do it.
- I know you can,

27:14.994 --> 27:16.461
but you've already baked
your own birthday cake.

27:16.495 --> 27:18.629
You shouldn't have to frost it. Right, dad?

27:18.664 --> 27:20.264
It's Mom's birthday.

27:20.299 --> 27:21.699
I guess she can do what she wants.

27:23.202 --> 27:25.303
Want me to get the
chairs out of the garage?

27:25.337 --> 27:26.904
Thank you, Ted.

27:32.544 --> 27:34.012
What's going on with you and dad?

27:34.046 --> 27:36.981
You need to do a crumb coat first.

27:37.016 --> 27:38.950
Okay.

27:38.984 --> 27:40.318
I don't know what that is.

27:40.352 --> 27:42.053
It's just easier if I do it.

27:42.087 --> 27:43.087
No, no. Mom.

27:43.088 --> 27:45.490
Tell me.

27:45.524 --> 27:48.192
You put a light layer on
first and then let it sit.

27:48.227 --> 27:50.228
Okay. Cool.

27:59.571 --> 28:01.506
Here we go.

28:01.540 --> 28:02.740
Yep.

28:02.775 --> 28:05.410
Did you just say "yep"?

28:05.444 --> 28:06.677
Yep.

28:08.580 --> 28:12.150
To state the obvious, this
is Mom's first birthday ever

28:12.184 --> 28:14.585
with all of her children.

28:14.620 --> 28:16.888
And I'm going to make a promise

28:16.922 --> 28:18.723
in front of you and all these balloons

28:18.757 --> 28:21.559
that I'm going to be nice to everyone.

28:21.593 --> 28:23.761
Including Ted Jr.?

28:23.796 --> 28:26.998
Pray for me.

28:33.572 --> 28:35.573
Hey.

28:35.607 --> 28:36.874
Mom in the kitchen?

28:36.909 --> 28:39.010
Where else?

28:39.044 --> 28:40.278
Would you?

28:40.312 --> 28:42.280
- I'm on it.
- Thank you.

28:45.784 --> 28:47.051
Happy Birthday, Mom.

28:47.086 --> 28:49.087
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

28:49.121 --> 28:50.388
Did you bring the...

28:50.422 --> 28:51.689
I did.

28:51.723 --> 28:52.957
Should I put it up top?

28:52.991 --> 28:54.592
Oh, the ham is in there.

28:54.626 --> 28:57.728
Got it.

28:57.763 --> 29:00.731
I'm not even gonna ask

29:00.766 --> 29:03.701
how you got her to let you
frost her own birthday cake.

29:03.735 --> 29:05.436
A first.

29:05.471 --> 29:07.438
Does it look okay?

29:07.473 --> 29:09.407
It looks like, um...

29:09.441 --> 29:10.808
You've never done it before.

29:10.843 --> 29:13.211
Thanks a lot, sister.

29:13.245 --> 29:14.412
Hey.

29:14.446 --> 29:15.913
Did you get the stuff?

29:15.948 --> 29:17.448
Jon's got everything in the other room.

29:17.483 --> 29:18.883
Okay. I'm gonna go.

29:18.917 --> 29:20.118
Yeah. Go.

29:20.152 --> 29:22.220
- Okay.
- I'm going. I'm going.

29:27.359 --> 29:29.093
Is Daniel here?

29:29.128 --> 29:31.395
Uh, Jared said he went off with a friend.

29:31.430 --> 29:34.065
That's good.

29:34.099 --> 29:35.333
But he knows.

29:35.367 --> 29:36.734
He'll be back.

29:36.768 --> 29:38.769
Of course, Mom.

29:38.804 --> 29:41.506
Happy Birthday!

29:41.540 --> 29:43.808
- Hey, y'all.
- Hey.

29:43.842 --> 29:45.443
- Hey, Tawney.
- Hi.

29:45.477 --> 29:47.345
Hey, Teddy.

29:47.379 --> 29:48.779
Hi, Amantha.

29:48.814 --> 29:50.781
Tawney, thank you. They're lovely.

29:50.816 --> 29:52.884
- Oh, I'm glad you like them.
- Teddy.

29:53.886 --> 29:54.952
Got a minute?

29:54.987 --> 29:57.088
Yeah. Sure.

29:57.122 --> 29:58.923
Here.

29:58.957 --> 30:01.816
Oh, I need to finish the glaze.

30:01.817 --> 30:02.360
Nope.

30:02.394 --> 30:03.628
It's your birthday, Mom.

30:03.662 --> 30:05.129
You are officially off duty.

30:05.164 --> 30:06.497
Uh, but the beans...

30:06.532 --> 30:07.798
Tawney.

30:07.833 --> 30:09.634
I-I'll do the beans, Janet.

30:09.668 --> 30:13.037
Mother, you are just gonna have to sit down

30:13.071 --> 30:14.639
and have a glass of wine

30:14.673 --> 30:17.175
and enjoy the delightful
company of your charming family.

30:17.209 --> 30:19.177
- I should set the table.
- We got it, Mom.

30:22.481 --> 30:24.515
Drink. Be merry.

30:30.756 --> 30:32.957
Need a boost there, buddy?

30:32.991 --> 30:34.492
I can reach it.

30:34.526 --> 30:36.494
Look at you getting all tall on us, Jared.

30:36.528 --> 30:38.796
Oh.

30:38.830 --> 30:41.032
Y'all didn't have to go to all this fuss.

30:41.066 --> 30:42.867
No fuss.

30:42.901 --> 30:46.270
Just thought we'd do a little
extra this year, considering.

30:48.006 --> 30:49.740
Happy Birthday, Mom.

30:49.775 --> 30:51.342
Thank you, Teddy.

30:51.376 --> 30:52.810
It'd be a lot better

30:52.844 --> 30:55.880
if you weren't in here seeing them do this.

30:57.182 --> 30:59.584
- Teddy.
- You all right?

30:59.618 --> 31:01.752
Why?

31:01.787 --> 31:03.087
I don't know.

31:03.121 --> 31:04.522
You ain't said nothing
smart aleck to me yet.

31:04.556 --> 31:06.757
Don't push your luck.

31:09.528 --> 31:11.529
Thirsty?

31:11.563 --> 31:14.031
Sure.

31:16.368 --> 31:18.536
Good to see you guys finally
came out of the closet.

31:20.239 --> 31:21.772
Mazel Tov.

31:23.575 --> 31:25.009
Is that appropriate?

31:25.043 --> 31:27.245
Thank you, Teddy.

31:27.279 --> 31:29.847
And, yes, Tawney, "mazel
tov" is appropriate.

31:29.881 --> 31:32.783
Good deal, brother.

31:38.090 --> 31:39.924
Where you gonna travel to?

31:39.958 --> 31:42.159
Also went to Vancouver.

31:44.997 --> 31:46.964
What do you think, Mom?

31:46.999 --> 31:48.532
Maybe we should go ahead and eat?

31:48.567 --> 31:51.435
It's been almost an hour.

31:51.470 --> 31:54.438
We can make a plate for
him for when he gets here.

31:56.675 --> 31:58.776
Maybe wait a little bit longer?

31:58.810 --> 32:02.079
Okay.

32:02.114 --> 32:04.048
Organic.

32:04.082 --> 32:05.650
Is that what you're gonna start buying now?

32:05.684 --> 32:07.585
Organic stuff?

32:08.535 --> 32:11.270
Oh, my goodness.
That was good, good, good.

32:11.305 --> 32:13.206
- Thank you.
- Everything was wonderful.

32:13.240 --> 32:15.808
- Mom, thank you.
- Delicious.

32:15.843 --> 32:17.410
Ted sr. Everything was wonderful.

32:17.444 --> 32:20.046
- I can't eat another bite.
- Thank you.

32:20.080 --> 32:22.381
I'm stuffed.

32:22.416 --> 32:24.884
Potatoes are awesome.

32:24.918 --> 32:26.219
Thanks. Can't stop eating them.

32:28.088 --> 32:29.722
I think everyone can agree

32:29.756 --> 32:32.224
that father time is working in reverse

32:32.259 --> 32:33.993
on my beautiful wife.

32:34.027 --> 32:35.160
Oh, now.

32:35.195 --> 32:37.930
Happy Birthday, sweetheart.

32:37.964 --> 32:39.265
Thank you, Ted.

32:39.299 --> 32:40.766
Happy Birthday, Mom.

32:46.339 --> 32:48.507
Mom, I also just want

32:48.541 --> 32:51.744
to say how much you mean to me and Tawney,

32:51.778 --> 32:53.858
and... and I just hope that
you know that anything...

33:06.126 --> 33:07.793
Come on in.

33:10.163 --> 33:12.698
Happy Birthday, Mother.

33:12.732 --> 33:15.601
I'm so sorry I'm late.

33:15.635 --> 33:17.002
I... It's okay.

33:17.037 --> 33:18.604
You're just in time for cake.

33:18.638 --> 33:21.640
Who's your friend, Daniel?

33:21.675 --> 33:23.342
This is, um...

33:23.376 --> 33:25.711
Lezley. With a "Z."

33:25.745 --> 33:27.146
- Hello.
- How do you do?

33:27.180 --> 33:31.483
He was helping me, um, find your present.

33:31.518 --> 33:34.620
One of my more difficult rummages.

33:34.654 --> 33:37.523
Well, thank you for your efforts.

33:37.557 --> 33:39.525
Oh, it was well worth the challenge,

33:39.559 --> 33:43.028
considering the circumstances
of this special occasion.

33:45.365 --> 33:48.667
Shall we go get her?

33:48.702 --> 33:50.836
Yes.

33:50.870 --> 33:54.206
I'll be right back.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.377
Okay, Mother.

33:58.411 --> 34:01.246
Come on through.

34:04.217 --> 34:07.820
It's a Wedgewood, like we talked about.

34:07.854 --> 34:09.688
Oh.

34:09.723 --> 34:13.859
R-right, like the... the photo
you showed me... a-a Wedgewood.

34:19.065 --> 34:22.067
I-I thought it was what you wanted.

34:22.101 --> 34:25.170
Well, I-I thought maybe down the line,

34:25.205 --> 34:28.674
but it's lovely, Daniel.

34:28.708 --> 34:30.409
Does it work?

34:30.443 --> 34:34.446
I was assured when it was
last used, there was no issue.

34:34.481 --> 34:37.716
Some refinishing might be appropriate.

34:37.751 --> 34:39.385
But you got to run a gas line in.

34:39.418 --> 34:42.087
Got a gas main line in?

34:42.121 --> 34:44.623
No. It... it's all electric.

34:44.657 --> 34:46.291
That won't be cheap.

34:46.326 --> 34:48.127
It can be done, Teddy.

34:48.161 --> 34:50.795
Oh, yeah. Sure. I mean, you know.

34:50.830 --> 34:54.099
Of course, you just got to rip
up the electric stove top there,

34:54.134 --> 34:55.967
pull the ovens out of the wall,
you know, that sort of thing.

34:56.002 --> 34:58.904
But... anything's possible.

34:58.938 --> 35:00.939
It's a nice gift, Daniel.

35:02.075 --> 35:04.076
Very thoughtful.

35:04.110 --> 35:05.611
It sure is.

35:05.645 --> 35:08.080
But w-we don't need to decide right now.

35:08.114 --> 35:09.948
We can put it in the garage for later.

35:12.352 --> 35:14.586
If it was me, I'd do it right now,

35:14.621 --> 35:17.089
while you're in the middle of a demo.

35:17.123 --> 35:18.924
I mean, it's not much
to take this out, really.

35:18.958 --> 35:21.093
And you have room to
run the gas line in here.

35:21.127 --> 35:22.895
Up here, cabinets.

35:22.929 --> 35:25.597
Down here, drawers, what have you.

35:25.632 --> 35:27.599
Wedgewood right there.

35:29.302 --> 35:31.670
I always liked gas stoves.

35:31.704 --> 35:34.239
Had one growing up.

35:34.274 --> 35:36.875
I think they make things
taste just a little better.

35:38.211 --> 35:40.512
If that's possible with
your mother's cooking.

35:42.449 --> 35:44.683
I'm just saying if it was me.

35:46.619 --> 35:48.654
Right now...

35:48.688 --> 35:50.422
Let's have some cake.

35:50.457 --> 35:52.724
Come on, Daniel.

36:00.033 --> 36:02.534
I'm sorry I said that you were...

36:02.569 --> 36:03.969
Full of shit.

36:04.003 --> 36:05.637
Yes.

36:05.672 --> 36:07.039
You taking it back?

36:07.073 --> 36:09.141
No.

36:12.212 --> 36:14.713
I believe forces brought
you out to my establishment

36:14.747 --> 36:17.816
in search of a stove
for your mama's birthday.

36:17.851 --> 36:21.019
Same forces will tell you
where to go next if you listen.

36:21.054 --> 36:24.990
Sometimes it's hard to hear.

36:25.024 --> 36:26.892
Yeah.

36:26.926 --> 36:30.362
Well, we usually hear
better when we're in pain.

36:30.396 --> 36:33.098
But, damn, if you ain't
got a high threshold.

36:35.235 --> 36:37.736
See you around the fringes, buddy.

36:45.445 --> 36:47.980
So, where to now, Lezley?

36:48.014 --> 36:52.284
Might ought to go look behind you.

36:55.088 --> 36:56.855
I'm afraid to.

36:56.890 --> 36:58.757
Yeah.

36:58.791 --> 37:00.392
I would be, too.

37:49.397 --> 37:51.298
I mean, it's a throwaway society.

37:51.333 --> 37:52.900
That's true.

37:52.934 --> 37:55.269
I mean, we buy stuff,
and then we throw it away.

37:55.303 --> 37:56.871
I mean, why not lease it

37:56.905 --> 37:58.906
and then give it back
when we're done, you know?

37:58.940 --> 38:00.641
Let them haul it off to the landfill.

38:00.675 --> 38:02.076
Good point.

38:02.110 --> 38:03.144
Damn right.

38:07.582 --> 38:10.384
Hello, Tawney.

38:10.418 --> 38:13.120
Hello, Daniel.

38:13.155 --> 38:15.756
You look restful.

38:15.791 --> 38:20.127
I feel restful.

38:20.162 --> 38:22.930
Thank you.

38:22.964 --> 38:24.465
How are you?

38:24.499 --> 38:25.800
How are you feeling?

38:25.834 --> 38:28.502
Well, I'm...

38:28.537 --> 38:30.237
I'm feeling a lot of things,

38:30.272 --> 38:34.809
but, uh, I wouldn't say
restful is one of them.

38:37.712 --> 38:40.047
Well...

38:42.184 --> 38:48.478
Thank you, Tawney, for, uh...

38:52.550 --> 38:56.019
I hope I did the right thing, Daniel.

38:58.489 --> 39:01.024
I think you did.

39:01.059 --> 39:04.928
You made me feel, Tawney.

39:04.962 --> 39:08.465
Really feel, you know?

39:14.739 --> 39:16.206
Yes.

39:18.176 --> 39:21.812
For the first time in a long time.

39:23.648 --> 39:27.584
That's a big part of what
makes us human, isn't it?

39:30.188 --> 39:32.022
I think so.

39:34.659 --> 39:37.394
I think it...

39:37.428 --> 39:40.163
Deepens us.

39:42.733 --> 39:44.501
I've been deepened.

39:44.535 --> 39:47.170
I think I'm gonna take me
some of that cake home.

39:47.205 --> 39:48.638
We're gonna have to scoot here in a minute.

39:48.673 --> 39:51.541
See what Tawn...

39:56.230 --> 39:57.430
Hey, everybody.

39:57.465 --> 39:59.666
I... got an announcement to make.

39:59.700 --> 40:01.034
Uh...

40:01.068 --> 40:03.036
H-hey, uh, baby, would you come here?

40:04.605 --> 40:07.140
Come here, baby.

40:11.812 --> 40:14.614
Mom, we got one more present for you.

40:16.884 --> 40:18.852
We're pregnant.

40:18.886 --> 40:20.787
What?! Oh, my gosh!

40:20.821 --> 40:22.255
- Surprise!
- Tawney!

40:22.289 --> 40:24.057
- Happy Birthday!
- Oh!

40:24.091 --> 40:25.892
- That's good news, son.
- Aw, thanks, dad.

40:25.926 --> 40:27.127
I appreciate it.

40:27.161 --> 40:28.695
I'm happy for you both.

40:28.729 --> 40:30.230
Oh, that's just wonderful.

40:30.264 --> 40:33.066
I know I wasn't supposed
to say anything, you know,

40:33.100 --> 40:35.702
but I just... I just couldn't wait.

40:35.736 --> 40:37.804
Just couldn't wait.

40:37.838 --> 40:39.272
Oh, boy.

40:39.306 --> 40:40.907
There's a bun in that oven, buddy.

40:40.941 --> 40:42.642
Congratulations, Teddy.

40:42.676 --> 40:44.711
- Thanks, Jon.
- Congratulations.

40:44.745 --> 40:46.613
Aww, thank you, Amantha. Appreciate it.

40:46.647 --> 40:48.087
Jon and I have an announcement, too.

40:49.350 --> 40:51.384
Oh.

40:51.418 --> 40:53.319
Ohh. We're not pregnant.

40:54.789 --> 40:56.556
Yet.

40:56.590 --> 41:02.415
We're just as happy as can
be about the whole thing.

41:06.554 --> 41:10.023
On Tuesday, I go to
this hospice in macon.

41:12.526 --> 41:15.128
You're a Saint, Charlie.

41:17.364 --> 41:20.466
Well...

41:20.501 --> 41:23.403
They're just people dying.

41:23.437 --> 41:25.638
Happens every day.

41:25.673 --> 41:28.308
Am I dying?

41:28.342 --> 41:32.145
Do you want to die, Daniel?

41:32.179 --> 41:35.348
My sister keeps interfering.

41:35.382 --> 41:37.183
You're mumbling.

41:37.218 --> 41:41.354
She's a little busybody, all grown up.

41:46.594 --> 41:49.929
Anyway...

41:49.964 --> 41:52.031
I play music for them.

41:52.066 --> 41:54.734
Sometimes that's all I do.

41:54.768 --> 41:58.171
Words can pale in comparison.

41:58.205 --> 42:00.006
Yours sure do.

42:03.611 --> 42:07.180
Well, for some...

42:07.214 --> 42:09.749
It's the only thing
that will let them sleep.

42:09.783 --> 42:13.052
It's the only thing that gives them solace.

42:13.087 --> 42:17.323
How long has it been since
you've heard music, Daniel?

42:40.180 --> 42:42.949
Beauty will redeem the world.

42:55.462 --> 42:58.331
You're a fool, Charlie.

44:11.146 --> 44:15.316
Daniel.

44:15.351 --> 44:17.652
Daniel.

44:19.388 --> 44:21.823
Daniel?
