[narrator]<i> A shocking piece</i>

00:27.627 --> 00:30.829
I knew right away she was

It was terrifying.
I hoped that she was alive.

<i>A frantic manhunt...</i>

00:37.104 --> 00:39.738
He had to come down
and he had to talk to me.

Looks like three letters.

00:44.512 --> 00:46.211

right there.

[narrator]<i> ...leads to</i>

00:49.516 --> 00:52.584
I knew that I was gonna
go get that monster.

00:52.653 --> 00:55.254
I didn't know whether I was
gonna be able to save Carlie.

01:39.566 --> 01:42.768
We just had so much fun
watching Carlie open up
all of her presents.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.502
It was so special.

01:44.572 --> 01:45.471
Merry Christmas, Princess.

01:47.908 --> 01:48.574
[chuckles]

01:48.976 --> 01:50.175
Oh, wow.

01:51.245 --> 01:52.411
This is beautiful.

01:53.914 --> 01:55.914
You might say that she was
a little bit spoiled

01:55.982 --> 02:00.085
when she was around us,
but only in the best of ways.

02:00.587 --> 02:01.720
I love it.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.122
Just one more thing.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.927
[Jeanne]<i> She was more like</i>
<i>a little sister to me</i>
<i>than my niece.</i>

02:08.996 --> 02:11.864
And she absolutely loved
being around us.

02:11.932 --> 02:15.000
And we loved just as much
being around her.

02:15.002 --> 02:15.834
Oh, wow.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.271
It's such a special memory,

02:19.273 --> 02:21.273
because to me,
she was growing up.

02:21.275 --> 02:23.275
She wasn't this little
baby anymore.

You don't want to
wait for a ride?

03:04.118 --> 03:05.817
No it's fine.
I'll be home for kickoff.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.387
Just be careful.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.221
Don't worry about it.

03:12.126 --> 03:14.392
I'm not sure why
Carlie decided

03:14.461 --> 03:17.662
to leave Danielle's house
early and walk home,

03:17.731 --> 03:20.265
but I know that
we would walk home

03:20.267 --> 03:22.968
or ride our bikes in the
neighborhood and felt safe.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.007
Hi, Susan. It's Connie.

03:29.076 --> 03:32.210
Just letting you know Carlie
just headed home on foot.

03:32.279 --> 03:33.779
Yeah. Thanks for letting
me know, Connie.

04:47.955 --> 04:48.954
Carlie was missing.

04:50.224 --> 04:51.356
They learned that

04:51.425 --> 04:53.959
Carlie had been over
at a friend's house, Danielle.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.299
[Connie] Carlie didn't stay
here last night.

05:00.367 --> 05:02.801
I was outs so Ron was
baby-sitting the girls.

05:03.903 --> 05:06.838
Connie and Danielle
told the responding deputies

05:06.907 --> 05:10.108
that Carlie had been a
little bit down and upset,

05:10.176 --> 05:12.777
her mother and stepfather
had been fighting a lot

05:12.846 --> 05:15.480
and that she had decided
to walk home early

05:15.549 --> 05:16.515
to be with her mother.

05:18.718 --> 05:20.985
[narrator]<i> Police issue a BOLO</i>

<i>They go door-to-door</i>
<i>and contact Carlie's friends.</i>

05:26.726 --> 05:28.259
[Connie] At this point,

05:28.328 --> 05:29.995
almost all of us in
the neighborhood

05:29.997 --> 05:31.663
have received a call.

05:31.732 --> 05:34.132
I think, in my innocent mind
at that time,

05:34.134 --> 05:37.536
I didn't think anything
of what really happened.

05:39.206 --> 05:42.274
The deputies searched all
known areas.

05:42.276 --> 05:44.543
We checked all the bases

05:44.545 --> 05:46.477
and there was still that hope,
though,

05:46.547 --> 05:48.680
that she might just show up
to school the next day,

05:48.682 --> 05:50.782
and maybe she's with someone
that we don't know.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.756
<i>Susan was very distraught.</i>

06:00.694 --> 06:02.493
I don't think Susan thought

06:02.563 --> 06:03.795
Carlie was showing up
to school.

06:05.499 --> 06:07.432
[Connie] We all went to school
the next day

06:07.501 --> 06:09.501
hoping to see Carlie come.

06:10.170 --> 06:13.638
Hoping to just be like,

06:13.706 --> 06:15.440
"Where the hell were you
last night?"

06:18.045 --> 06:19.978
[Hallisey]
When Carlie did not show up

06:20.046 --> 06:21.246
at school the next morning,

06:21.314 --> 06:23.381
we called out the bloodhounds

06:23.383 --> 06:24.850
to try to get a track

06:24.852 --> 06:27.652
and establish her last known
whereabouts.

06:27.720 --> 06:31.122
We acquired the pillowcase
from Carlie's house

06:31.191 --> 06:34.659
as a 'scent article' for
the bloodhounds to track.

06:34.728 --> 06:38.930
The bloodhounds tracked down
Bee Ridge Road, due West,

06:38.999 --> 06:42.434
which would have been
the direct route from Connie's
house to Carlie's home.

06:51.144 --> 06:53.678
The bloodhounds tracked
on an angle

06:53.680 --> 06:57.081
through a car wash
towards the side street

06:57.150 --> 06:59.785
that would be a shortcut
to Carlie's home.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.424
[dogs barking]

07:06.493 --> 07:09.160
<i>The bloodhounds split</i>
<i>in different directions</i>

07:09.162 --> 07:12.230
<i>right around the rear of</i>
<i>this car wash.</i>

07:14.201 --> 07:16.902
<i>It was apparent that they were</i>
<i>no longer tracking her scent.</i>

07:19.840 --> 07:23.908
Once we realized that Carlie
had taken this route,

07:23.977 --> 07:28.246
that it was clear that she
had walked through the park
and alive.

07:28.314 --> 07:30.047
uh, on her way to
the shortcut,

07:30.117 --> 07:33.118
we began talking to
the local businesses

07:33.186 --> 07:36.021
to see if they knew anything
or had cameras.

07:44.798 --> 07:48.266
We realized that the carwash
had a surveillance system.

07:48.268 --> 07:49.601
They had cameras.

07:50.938 --> 07:52.671
We were hoping at that point

07:52.673 --> 07:55.340
that it contained some footage
of Carlie.

07:55.408 --> 07:57.408
I never would have imagined

07:57.477 --> 08:00.078
seeing what I saw on
the camera that day.

08:08.288 --> 08:12.290
The car wash had a number
of cameras that covered

08:12.292 --> 08:14.693
the rear, side and front
of the building.

08:16.362 --> 08:20.499
All of the cameras
on that building
were motion-activated.

08:20.567 --> 08:22.701
Surveillance systems allow us

08:22.703 --> 08:24.302
to look at the footage
ourselves

08:24.304 --> 08:27.305
for what it is,
removed from the moment.

08:27.374 --> 08:29.975
It's a very valuable tool
for us.

08:32.178 --> 08:33.978
We cued up the video

08:34.047 --> 08:36.714
to about the time
that we expected Carlie

08:36.783 --> 08:39.317
would be walking
through the parking lot.

08:42.589 --> 08:44.789
[Detective] What do you got
around 6:20 pm?

08:44.858 --> 08:46.157
[keys clacking]

08:54.000 --> 08:56.067
[Hallisey]
When we cued up the video,

08:56.069 --> 08:58.002
we could see the empty
parking lot

08:58.071 --> 09:00.372
and the cars travelling
along Bee Ridge road.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.476
But no foot traffic,

09:04.478 --> 09:06.077
there was nobody walking.

09:07.013 --> 09:09.080
And there was
no sign of Carlie.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.215
Okay, let's try
another camera.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.484
Do you have any
facing the front lot?

09:13.420 --> 09:14.886
Same time, 6:20.

09:26.032 --> 09:28.699
[Hallisey] The next camera
that we looked at

09:28.769 --> 09:30.902
was an angle
across the parking lot.

09:35.842 --> 09:37.308
We watched the video carefully

09:37.377 --> 09:40.845
looking for any evidence that
Carlie had walked by there,

09:40.914 --> 09:42.581
but we didn't find anything.

09:44.651 --> 09:46.117
[narrator]
<i>The bloodhounds indicated</i>

09:46.185 --> 09:48.520
<i>Carlie turned off</i>
<i>Bee Ridge road,</i>

09:48.522 --> 09:50.522
and passed right by
the car wash.

09:51.524 --> 09:53.258
[Hallisey]
I couldn't understand

09:53.326 --> 09:55.727
why we wouldn't have
a picture of Carlie,

09:55.795 --> 09:58.663
Why we don't see her
walking through
the parking lot.

09:58.731 --> 10:00.665
If she didn't walk
in front of the building,

10:00.733 --> 10:01.866
which is Bee Ridge Road,

10:01.934 --> 10:04.201
we should have captured her

10:04.271 --> 10:06.137
walking through
the parking lot on an angle.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.573
All right. Let's try
another camera.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.943
[narrator]
<i>This motion-activated camera</i>

10:12.012 --> 10:13.678
<i>faces the rear of</i>
<i>the car wash.</i>

10:21.221 --> 10:23.054
Looks like the camera hasn't
been triggered yet.

10:28.829 --> 10:29.828
Come on.

10:34.701 --> 10:36.835
Whoa! Freeze it.

10:36.837 --> 10:39.337
At 6:21, the screen lights up.

10:40.773 --> 10:44.643
We see a young female
on one side, coming towards
the camera,

10:44.711 --> 10:48.713
and a male with his
back to the camera
walking towards her.

10:48.715 --> 10:50.782
The girl in the video
had a red shirt on.

10:50.850 --> 10:52.316
I knew Carlie had a red shirt.

10:52.385 --> 10:55.386
The girl had blue jeans.
So did Carlie.

10:55.455 --> 10:57.088
And there was
a pink backpack.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.824
And, at that moment, I knew

11:00.861 --> 11:01.793
that was Carlie.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.095
Play on.

11:30.624 --> 11:33.758
Having Carlie and this man
right there,

11:33.760 --> 11:36.227
captured on video,
was unbelievable.

11:36.963 --> 11:38.162
Okay, let's rewind it.

11:38.231 --> 11:39.064
Watch the whole thing again.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.500
In real time, it looks like

11:42.568 --> 11:45.837
Carlie may be walking past
this individual.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.505
In slow frame, you could see

11:47.574 --> 11:49.507
that she was wearing
a Walkman,

11:49.576 --> 11:51.509
that she was listening
to music, perhaps.

11:51.578 --> 11:54.813
And that she was actually
looking down.

11:55.849 --> 11:57.115
Okay, let's play it
over again.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.184
It was apparent to me

11:59.186 --> 12:01.786
that Carlie did not want to
make contact with this person.

12:01.855 --> 12:04.122
She did not appear at all
that she wanted

12:04.124 --> 12:06.324
to engage this person
in any way.

12:10.530 --> 12:12.230
Can you zoom in on his hands?

12:13.733 --> 12:16.601
As he walked up to her
and grabbed her,

12:16.669 --> 12:18.403
he then says something to her.

12:18.405 --> 12:21.206
The man had his right hand
in his pocket

12:21.208 --> 12:23.341
and then takes his hand out
of his pocket.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.677
It would have made sense to me

12:26.746 --> 12:30.949
that the man threatened her
with a weapon of some kind.

12:30.951 --> 12:34.084
I knew this was not
a friendly encounter.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.821
I knew right away
she was in big trouble.

12:37.690 --> 12:38.690
Okay. Play on.

12:40.427 --> 12:43.695
They turn and actually walk
at the camera.

12:43.763 --> 12:47.031
At that point, it becomes
clear he's a white male,

12:47.100 --> 12:49.433
fairly stocky, average height,

12:49.502 --> 12:51.402
with a full head of dark hair.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.838
[Detective]
Punch in on his face.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.375
It was ominous.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.176
It was more than concerning.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.979
I was very fearful for her.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.385
Having this footage
was amazing.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.989
We have information,
we have something
to work with.

13:10.991 --> 13:14.391
Carlie was last seen
by herself.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.661
Now we have her with somebody.

13:16.729 --> 13:19.597
And until we identify
who this person is,

13:19.666 --> 13:23.101
We can't move any further
for we need to know who this
person is.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.874
When you're investigating
a crime against a child,

13:29.943 --> 13:32.943
you're starting with
the inner circle,
the family first,

13:33.013 --> 13:36.047
the parents, and then you
kind of work your way out
from there.

13:38.351 --> 13:41.953
[narrator]<i> Carlie's step-dad,</i>
<i>Steven Kansler,</i>
<i>is asked to come in.</i>

13:43.823 --> 13:46.958
We talked to him about
his alibi and where he was
that evening.

13:48.761 --> 13:52.163
[narrator]<i> Steven says</i>
<i>he's home with Susan,</i>
<i>Carlie's mom.</i>

14:09.449 --> 14:12.050
Steven reported to us that
while he was driving around,

14:12.118 --> 14:14.319
he was constantly
on his phone,

14:14.387 --> 14:17.622
calling back to Susan,
trying to find out whether

14:17.690 --> 14:20.792
Carlie had come back home,
or where she possibly
could be.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.620
We checked Steven's
cell phone records

14:48.688 --> 14:51.355
and used them to verify
his whereabouts.

14:51.424 --> 14:54.425
Steven was easily eliminated
as a suspect,

14:54.427 --> 14:57.428
but, he immediately
identified another subject.

14:59.632 --> 15:01.099
As he's driving around,

15:01.101 --> 15:03.100
he notices
this red pickup truck.

15:03.169 --> 15:06.704
And, this red pickup truck
is also driving up and down
Bee Ridge,

15:06.706 --> 15:09.707
and actually pulls into
the car wash a couple of times

15:09.776 --> 15:11.843
as Steven is watching him.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.846
This tow truck kind of acts
unusual in that,

15:14.848 --> 15:16.748
it speeds away
a couple of times.

15:30.063 --> 15:33.765
[narrator]<i> When they go back</i>
<i>to double check Carlie's</i>
<i>friend's house...</i>

15:45.678 --> 15:48.545
Steven says
that he is 100% sure

15:48.615 --> 15:51.416
that the tow truck
parked in Connie's yard

15:51.418 --> 15:54.118
is the one he saw driving
up and down Bee Ridge road.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.956
Steven tells us that he knows

15:59.025 --> 16:03.227
that the driver of the red
pickup lives at Connie's house

16:03.296 --> 16:07.231
He also knows that the driver,
whose name is Ron Choquette,

16:07.300 --> 16:10.335
stayed the night at Connie's
house the previous evening.

16:17.043 --> 16:21.245
We go back to the videotape
and examine the subject's
clothing.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.114
He is wearing
what appears to be

16:23.182 --> 16:27.151
a gray mechanic's uniform
with a single name patch.

16:28.254 --> 16:32.523
That gray uniform is
commonly worn by mechanics

16:33.193 --> 16:34.325
and tow truck drivers.

16:37.196 --> 16:39.864
-Do you want me to pull
this license?
-Yeah.

16:39.932 --> 16:42.400
[Davis] It is at
that point that we really
became focused on

16:42.468 --> 16:45.135
Ron Choquette as the
tow truck driver,

16:45.205 --> 16:49.206
as a person who had spent
the night with Carlie,
the previous evening

16:49.275 --> 16:50.441
That's the number one suspect.

16:52.278 --> 16:53.745
I immediately
had to speak to him.

16:55.081 --> 16:57.749
He had to come down
and he had to talk to me.

17:02.822 --> 17:05.823
Ron Choquette appeared
to be the same individual

17:05.892 --> 17:07.558
that I saw in the video.

17:08.428 --> 17:09.994
We did a formal interview
with Ron.

18:02.749 --> 18:07.151
When I confronted Ron
Choquette about his tow truck

18:07.219 --> 18:11.355
being on Bee Ridge Road,
he admitted that he was
on Bee Ridge Road.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.358
But, he claimed the reason
he was driving his tow truck.

18:14.426 --> 18:16.661
was, he too,
was looking for Carlie.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.676
We showed him a still
photograph of Carlie
and this man.

19:25.297 --> 19:27.765
I left Ron Choquette there
in the interview room,

19:27.833 --> 19:30.568
and I immediately drove to
the tow truck company

19:30.570 --> 19:31.903
where he said his alibi was.

19:36.108 --> 19:39.042
I met his coworkers,
and I met his boss.

19:39.112 --> 19:42.113
They verified that
Ron was on-duty

19:42.181 --> 19:44.582
and working during
the Super Bowl.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.984
And, in fact, gave me
his time cards

19:47.052 --> 19:49.787
to prove that
he had been at work.

19:49.789 --> 19:53.724
<i>I executed a search warrant</i>
<i>on Ron Choquette's tow truck,</i>

19:53.793 --> 19:55.192
<i>looking for any evidence</i>

19:55.261 --> 19:57.195
<i>that Carlie had been</i>
<i>in that tow truck.</i>

20:06.072 --> 20:09.006
I didn't find any evidence
during that search warrant,

20:09.074 --> 20:12.243
and I cleared Ron Choquette
as a suspect in this case.

20:14.347 --> 20:16.814
The problem was,
Carlie was still missing,

20:16.882 --> 20:18.516
and we had no more suspects.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.152
Thank you for coming in,
Susan,

20:22.221 --> 20:24.388
I know this is not
the easiest time for you.

20:25.158 --> 20:26.023
Please have a seat.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.629
So we're hoping
you can help us

20:31.697 --> 20:34.765
identify someone we found
in the tapes here.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.767
[inserting video tape]

20:36.769 --> 20:41.638
Carlie's mother, Susan,
was beside herself with grief.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.008
She was scared,
she was nervous.

20:46.512 --> 20:48.980
<i>Initially there was this</i>

20:49.048 --> 20:53.584
<i>almost gut instinct of,</i>
<i>"Who is this person?"</i>

20:57.056 --> 20:58.155
[Hallisey] Do you recognize
the gentleman?

20:58.658 --> 20:59.357
No.

20:59.859 --> 21:01.158
[sobs]

21:02.128 --> 21:04.328
You could see the emotion
takeover her

21:04.397 --> 21:07.064
and she became
very distraught.

21:07.132 --> 21:08.232
[continues sobbing]

21:10.002 --> 21:12.937
It was difficult
to watch her break down

21:12.939 --> 21:16.207
knowing that this man
that nobody knows who he is

21:16.275 --> 21:18.809
has potentially taken Carlie.

21:18.811 --> 21:20.578
Again, thank you so much
for coming in.

21:22.281 --> 21:23.147
I'll show you out.

21:32.891 --> 21:35.025
The search for
a missing Florida girl

21:35.094 --> 21:36.560
has kicked into high gear.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.696
Since her disappearance
on Sunday,

21:38.764 --> 21:41.766
the urgency to find
11-year-old Carlie Brucia

21:41.768 --> 21:45.169
has mounted
with each passing second.

21:45.237 --> 21:47.704
[Hallisey] In releasing
the video to the media,

21:47.774 --> 21:49.973
we hoped would gather
information,

21:50.042 --> 21:52.977
would give us information
as to, "Who is this person?

21:52.979 --> 21:54.578
Someone has to know."

21:54.580 --> 21:58.449
It's a clear enough image
that we know that
that's Carlie.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.451
So, whoever this man is,

22:00.453 --> 22:03.253
someone would know
and someone would call.

22:03.322 --> 22:04.355
We had to find her.

22:05.525 --> 22:07.257
There was no other option.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.326
<i>Finding her could spin on</i>
<i>two things:</i>

22:09.395 --> 22:11.662
<i>an activated AMBER alert,</i>

22:11.664 --> 22:14.198
and the watchful eye of
a surveillance camera.

22:14.200 --> 22:15.666
<i>CNN's John Zarrella is joining</i>
<i>us live...</i>

22:15.668 --> 22:16.734
[news anchor speaking]

22:16.802 --> 22:20.871
Footage of Carlie's kidnapping
was repeated constantly.

22:20.939 --> 22:22.740
It was almost always on.

22:24.009 --> 22:25.409
[Jeanne] I was so scared
for her.

22:25.411 --> 22:26.944
I just got thinking,

22:27.012 --> 22:29.613
"Where could she be?
Is she hurt?

22:29.682 --> 22:32.683
Is she cold?
Is she by herself?

22:32.752 --> 22:34.351
Where is she?"

22:34.353 --> 22:37.220
I hoped that she was alive.

22:37.290 --> 22:38.822
<i>...and her parents</i>
<i>are also saying</i>

22:38.891 --> 22:41.025
<i>that it is no one</i>
<i>that they know.</i>

22:41.027 --> 22:43.561
[Kate]<i> It was really hard</i>
<i>to look up</i>

22:43.563 --> 22:45.563
and see my niece being
taken away

22:45.565 --> 22:48.832
and not be able to yell,
"don't go!"

22:48.901 --> 22:51.402
um, knowing she couldn't
hear me,

22:52.371 --> 22:53.604
and it was too late.

22:57.577 --> 23:00.311
I was really concerned
for Carlie's safety.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.546
It was an extremely
unusual case.

23:03.449 --> 23:04.815
[phones ringing in background]

23:05.985 --> 23:08.853
<i>During this investigation,</i>
<i>no one gets any sleep.</i>

23:08.921 --> 23:11.054
<i>The entire agency is up.</i>

23:11.123 --> 23:13.324
<i>Every person who's working</i>
<i>this case is up.</i>

23:13.326 --> 23:16.126
And no one sleeps because
we're looking for Carlie.

23:16.128 --> 23:17.795
[Detective] All right, what do
you guys got for me?

23:17.863 --> 23:18.929
Play it from the beginning.

23:20.533 --> 23:23.868
[Detective Davis]
<i>When she disappeared,</i>
<i>a single piece of evidence</i>

23:23.870 --> 23:28.272
that we were able to use
was that piece
of surveillance video.

23:29.341 --> 23:31.742
We went back through
the footage,

23:33.011 --> 23:34.545
looking for anything else,

23:34.547 --> 23:35.813
maybe something we missed.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.485
When you look closer,
you realize that rectangle

23:41.553 --> 23:44.188
over the left pocket
is actually a name-tag.

23:46.292 --> 23:47.458
Zoom in on that name tag.

23:51.898 --> 23:52.997
Looks like three letters.

23:56.302 --> 23:57.902
[Hallisey]
<i>However, it's too blurry.</i>

23:57.904 --> 23:59.737
You couldn't tell exactly
what it said.

24:04.844 --> 24:07.878
I tried to enhance it
using our software.

24:09.382 --> 24:11.015
I worked on it for hours,

24:11.917 --> 24:14.451
because the information
was right there.

24:14.453 --> 24:17.455
His first name, most likely,
right there.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.758
But it was difficult.
It was frustrating.

24:24.730 --> 24:25.596
But, we couldn't get it.

24:28.868 --> 24:31.468
The more time went by,
the more it was obvious

24:31.537 --> 24:34.004
that we would not find
Carlie alive.

24:34.073 --> 24:37.675
But I don't think I ever even
fully committed to that idea.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.544
I had to hold out hope.

24:41.414 --> 24:43.414
There's a moment
on that videotape

24:43.416 --> 24:46.950
when Carlie is looking up,

24:47.019 --> 24:53.324
and, as adults, we know
what is about to happen to her

24:53.960 --> 24:55.259
and she does not.

24:56.762 --> 24:59.830
And we know

24:59.898 --> 25:03.100
that the white male subject on
that videotape is a monster.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.271
I knew that I was gonna go
get that monster.

25:09.308 --> 25:13.109
I didn't know whether
I was going to be
able to save Carlie.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.913
[news anchor]<i> The search for</i>
<i>Carlie Brucia has gone</i>
<i>national,</i>

25:15.981 --> 25:19.383
<i>with the FBI also providing</i>
<i>it's resources to find her.</i>

25:20.586 --> 25:22.920
The communications center
was inundated.

25:22.922 --> 25:26.523
We received thousands
of phone calls.

25:26.525 --> 25:29.059
From those phone calls,
we were able to obtain

25:29.127 --> 25:33.563
a little over 700 leads
or tips to investigate.

25:33.565 --> 25:37.067
One of those phone calls
provided us with information

25:37.069 --> 25:39.637
that would take this case
in a completely
different direction.

25:48.147 --> 25:51.682
After almost 48 hours,
we are desperate
to find Carlie.

25:53.085 --> 25:54.818
We hope that
she is still alive.

25:56.555 --> 25:57.922
[phone ringing]

25:59.625 --> 26:04.094
Tuesday early morning
we received a phone call
to the tip line.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.697
identifying a man in the video

26:06.798 --> 26:09.333
as being the business partner
of the caller.

26:10.902 --> 26:13.037
The caller identified the man

26:13.105 --> 26:16.941
in the video with Carlie
as Joseph Smith.

26:19.779 --> 26:22.913
He said that he could tell
by the way he walked,

26:22.982 --> 26:25.982
that that's the uniform
that he wore to work,

26:26.052 --> 26:29.687
that the name tag
on the uniform says Joe.

26:31.790 --> 26:35.092
[narrator]<i> Background checks</i>
<i>reveal that Smith</i>
<i>is on probation.</i>

26:37.663 --> 26:40.931
[Davis] We knew that
Joseph Smith
drove a brown Lincoln.

26:41.000 --> 26:43.601
We started to really look,
on the video,

26:44.269 --> 26:46.003
if it had caught anything.

26:46.071 --> 26:49.673
And, in particular,
Joseph Smith's brown Lincoln.

26:52.611 --> 26:57.247
Will you pull up the cameras
facing the parking lot
from 6:18.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.162
[Hallisey]
<i>There's no sign of</i>
<i>a brown Lincoln.</i>

27:16.034 --> 27:20.771
<i>You can see all sorts of cars,</i>
<i>station wagons, trucks,</i>

27:20.839 --> 27:23.874
but no vehicles that we could
connect to Joseph Smith.

27:25.444 --> 27:26.977
Skip ahead to the next camera.

27:36.122 --> 27:37.888
Ooh! That station wagon there.

27:44.930 --> 27:45.796
Play it back.

27:47.600 --> 27:50.534
[Hallisey]
I noticed a light tan
colored station wagon

27:50.602 --> 27:52.536
driving through
the parking lot

27:52.604 --> 27:54.238
and going back out
onto Bee Ridge.

27:55.341 --> 27:55.973
Pause it.

28:00.479 --> 28:03.347
Examining the video closer,
you can tell

28:03.349 --> 28:05.215
that it's
a Buick station wagon.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.954
However, the image
is not clear enough

28:11.022 --> 28:13.957
to identify who's driving
or the license tag.

28:15.761 --> 28:19.362
[narrator]<i> It's a different</i>
<i>make and color to</i>
<i>Joseph Smith's car.</i>

28:19.431 --> 28:22.633
<i>Still, Hallisey wants to see</i>
<i>where it goes next.</i>

28:23.903 --> 28:24.868
6:18.

28:36.248 --> 28:39.582
I could see that car
travelling along Bee Ridge.

28:39.652 --> 28:44.187
And actually, I could see
the car braking in front of
the car wash

28:44.256 --> 28:50.360
to turn on an adjacent road,
a road directly beside
the car wash.

28:52.865 --> 28:55.532
If they were not
directly involved,

28:55.600 --> 28:58.135
that driver had to have
seen something.

28:58.203 --> 29:02.239
I needed to find
that car and find out
who was driving that car.

29:06.212 --> 29:10.881
[narrator]<i> Meantime,</i>
<i>Detective Davis pays a visit</i>
<i>to their prime suspect.</i>

29:10.949 --> 29:12.816
Myself and
two other detectives

29:12.885 --> 29:15.619
drive over there to talk
to Joseph Smith.

29:16.889 --> 29:19.355
-[Joseph] Yes?
-[Davis] Joseph Smith?

29:19.425 --> 29:22.159
-Yes.
-I'm Detective Davis.
Can I ask you a few questions?

29:23.295 --> 29:24.694
[Joseph] Of course.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.565
I sit down with Joseph Smith
and I talk to him
for about 45 minutes.

29:28.667 --> 29:30.367
Where were you
during the Super Bowl?

29:30.369 --> 29:31.634
-The Super Bowl?
-Yeah.

29:31.704 --> 29:32.636
I was here.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.605
Were you with anyone?

29:35.441 --> 29:37.541
Yeah, Mimi, she's my landlord.

29:39.311 --> 29:42.913
It's at that point that I tell
him that I'm investigating
the abduction of a child.

29:43.982 --> 29:47.518
And I produce a picture
from the camera.

29:47.586 --> 29:50.988
It shows a white male subject
and Carlie.

29:52.090 --> 29:54.691
He takes that picture
and he looks at and says,

29:56.395 --> 30:00.364
That looks like me,
but it's not me.

<i>Detective Davis asks Smith</i>

30:04.536 --> 30:07.538

we go to his closet.

30:13.479 --> 30:18.748
And he produces two pressed,
cleaned mechanics uniforms,

30:18.817 --> 30:22.586
and it had one name patch
on it with his name, Joe.

30:25.224 --> 30:27.423
The subject in the videotape

30:27.493 --> 30:30.227
is wearing
a gray mechanics uniform,

30:30.295 --> 30:32.329
with
a single name patch on it.

30:34.033 --> 30:36.566
He did not seem to be nervous.

30:36.635 --> 30:39.303
He did not appear
to be anxious.

30:39.371 --> 30:41.838
And he was
extremely cooperative

30:41.907 --> 30:43.407
the whole time I was with him.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.645
-[Joseph] Oh, hey, Mimi.
-Hello, Joe.

30:48.714 --> 30:50.647
[Joseph] Uh, this is Mimi,
my landlord's wife.

30:50.716 --> 30:51.915
-[Davis] Hi Mimi.
-Hi.

30:51.983 --> 30:53.483
-I'm Detective Davis.
-Oh, okay.

30:53.551 --> 30:55.985
-Can I ask you
a few questions?
-Yeah, sure. Yeah.

30:56.055 --> 30:58.455
Mimi Pincus is also the person

30:58.523 --> 31:02.459
that Joe said he had been
with all Super Bowl Sunday.

31:02.461 --> 31:05.996
<i>Mimi tells me that Joe</i>
<i>is home from 3:00</i>

31:06.064 --> 31:07.931
<i>till at least half-time</i>
<i>during the Super Bowl.</i>

31:07.999 --> 31:12.469
<i>She remembers getting a call</i>
<i>from Joe's wife.</i>

31:12.471 --> 31:15.739
And she remembers that
Joe said he was going
to get it,

31:15.807 --> 31:17.807
[Mimi] ...and I yelled out,
Joe the phone's for you...

31:17.876 --> 31:22.212
[Davis]
<i>When Joseph Smith's alibi</i>
<i>was verified by Mimi Pincus,</i>

31:22.280 --> 31:24.514
I cleared him as a suspect
in this case.

31:26.885 --> 31:30.621
[narrator]<i> But the search</i>
<i>of Smith's car turns up</i>
<i>drug paraphernalia.</i>

31:32.224 --> 31:36.025
<i>Smith is arrested and held</i>
<i>for violating his parole.</i>

31:36.095 --> 31:37.127
I messed up.

31:43.836 --> 31:45.501
[narrator]
<i>Carlie's disappearance</i>

31:45.571 --> 31:48.705
<i>leads to a huge community</i>
<i>effort to bring her home.</i>

31:50.509 --> 31:53.977
It was all over the news
when I knew for sure

31:53.979 --> 31:56.380
something really bad
had happened.

31:56.382 --> 31:59.515
<i>All day long we were</i>
<i>passing out flyers.</i>

31:59.585 --> 32:01.584
<i>We were all very scared.</i>

32:01.653 --> 32:04.454
<i>Our parents hugged us harder.</i>

32:04.523 --> 32:08.125
We were just in desperate need
to find our friend.

32:10.996 --> 32:14.598
[narrator]<i> It's now 48 hours</i>
<i>since Carlie disappeared.</i>

32:16.135 --> 32:18.668
[Davis] At around
7:00 o'clock that evening,
I was contacted

32:18.737 --> 32:21.938
by the front desk officer
who stated that Jeff Pincus

32:22.007 --> 32:23.941
was in the lobby
and wanted to speak to me.

32:26.678 --> 32:31.281
[narrator]
<i>Jeff Pincus is Mimi's husband</i>
<i>and Joseph Smith's landlord,</i>

32:31.350 --> 32:33.483
<i>and he's driving</i>
<i>a station wagon.</i>

32:36.221 --> 32:40.357
I noticed a light colored
station wagon
in the parking lot.

32:41.559 --> 32:43.626
That was the same
station wagon

32:43.695 --> 32:46.563
I saw on the earlier footage
from the car wash.

32:48.366 --> 32:51.635
<i>The Buick is a key piece</i>
<i>of information.</i>

32:53.505 --> 32:56.506
I needed to find out who was
driving that car

32:56.575 --> 32:58.442
at the time that Carlie
was taken.

33:03.515 --> 33:07.117
[narrator]<i> Jeff wants</i>
<i>to correct his wife, Mimi's,</i>
<i>account of that night.</i>

33:14.726 --> 33:18.128
Jeff told me that Mimi
was confused about the times,

33:18.196 --> 33:20.730
and that she had been focusing
too much on her grandchild

33:20.732 --> 33:22.131
whom she had been babysitting,

33:22.134 --> 33:25.202
to really focus on where
Joseph Smith had been.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.296
[Jeff] Bring it back safe.

33:54.099 --> 33:55.232
[Joseph] Sure.

33:55.300 --> 33:59.269
<i>Jeff Pincus tears apart</i>
<i>Joseph Smith's alibi.</i>

34:02.107 --> 34:04.440
Jeff had given Joe
the station wagon

34:04.510 --> 34:07.043
at about 3:00
that afternoon.

34:07.112 --> 34:10.714
And Joe did not return
the vehicle until
Monday morning.

34:36.141 --> 34:39.443
He knew that there had been
something going on
in the Buick.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.746
The back seat
had been laid down.

34:44.015 --> 34:47.150
And that the whole condition
of the vehicle had changed.

34:47.219 --> 34:48.885
Things were out of place.

35:13.512 --> 35:16.846
<i>Jeff Pincus completely changes</i>
<i>the investigation.</i>

35:16.848 --> 35:22.586
And, he refocuses Joe as
the main and only suspect
in this crime.

35:29.594 --> 35:33.129
We now know that Joe
has no alibi.

35:33.131 --> 35:36.533
We now know that Joe
wears gray uniforms.

35:36.601 --> 35:40.603
We now know that
Joe was driving
a yellow station wagon.

35:40.672 --> 35:44.274
We now know that Joe
is the guy on the video.

35:53.218 --> 35:54.817
[Schaeffer] Law enforcement,
the sheriff's office

35:54.886 --> 35:57.420
has their lead suspect,
Joseph Smith.

35:57.422 --> 35:59.489
They've done a great job
in their investigation,

35:59.558 --> 36:01.591
but they still
have not located Carlie.

36:06.431 --> 36:09.299
[narrator]<i> Investigators</i>
<i>arrange a formal interview</i>
<i>with Smith,</i>

36:09.301 --> 36:12.536
<i>who's in custody</i>
<i>for violating his parole.</i>

36:13.771 --> 36:15.905
[Hallisey]
We have lots of evidence
against him.

36:15.974 --> 36:19.176
We'd like to know
from his own mouth
what he did.

36:39.864 --> 36:42.432
[narrator]<i> Detective Davis</i>
<i>reads Smith his rights.</i>

37:04.956 --> 37:07.958
During this interview,
he requests to speak
to a lawyer

37:08.026 --> 37:09.826
and refuses to answer
any questions.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.997
[Hallisey]
<i>It's frustrating.</i>
<i>He's sitting right there,</i>

37:14.833 --> 37:17.166
<i>and he knows where she is</i>

37:17.235 --> 37:19.102
<i>or is likely to be able</i>
<i>to tell us.</i>

37:20.172 --> 37:23.173
And, uh, it's up to him
to co-operate.

37:25.644 --> 37:28.778
[narrator]<i> Joseph Smith</i>
<i>isn't talking to authorities.</i>

37:28.847 --> 37:32.349
<i>But, from jail, he is talking</i>
<i>to his brother, John.</i>

37:38.590 --> 37:40.457
[phone ringing]

37:40.459 --> 37:44.194
[Davis]
John calls us and tells us
that Joe has confessed to him.

37:44.730 --> 37:45.996
Hi, John.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.199
My brother...

37:49.267 --> 37:53.002
To kidnapping Carlie,
killing Carlie,

37:53.071 --> 37:56.406
and having had
sexually battered Carlie.

37:56.474 --> 37:59.475
[John] It's behind the church
on Proctor Road.

37:59.544 --> 38:03.813
[Detective Davis]
Joe describes to John
how we can find Carlie's body.

38:04.616 --> 38:05.482
It's, um...

38:08.353 --> 38:10.153
[over phone]<i> ...it's in</i>
<i>the church off Proctor</i>

38:10.221 --> 38:11.488
<i>in the, uh...</i>

38:12.758 --> 38:13.823
in the backwoods.

38:13.891 --> 38:15.325
Thank you. I'm on the way.

38:20.098 --> 38:24.634
[Davis] We pull onto the dark
parking lot and face the area

38:24.636 --> 38:27.103
that Joe says
he has dumped the body.

38:30.776 --> 38:33.710
We stay in the parking lot and
I wait for a forensics team.

38:43.722 --> 38:44.754
[Davis] Show me the way.

38:57.202 --> 38:59.869
We know he used a ligature
and strangled her

38:59.871 --> 39:03.239
and left her body in the woods
behind the church.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.145
It is...

39:09.214 --> 39:11.381
a devastating time...

39:17.155 --> 39:19.689
and it is a tragic end
to Carlie's life.

39:22.561 --> 39:25.628
[narrator]
<i>Investigators finally build</i>
<i>a complete picture</i>

39:25.696 --> 39:27.330

[Joseph] Can I borrow the car
real quick?

39:30.302 --> 39:32.569

[Joseph] Sure.

<i>According to him,</i>

39:40.979 --> 39:45.014
<i>taking a cocktail of drugs,</i>
<i>ending up on Bee Ridge Road.</i>

39:46.584 --> 39:49.051
Joseph Smith
is coming from Bee Ridge,

39:49.120 --> 39:51.254
passes Carlie walking
on the road,

39:51.256 --> 39:55.058
and decides that she's
going to be his victim.

39:55.126 --> 39:58.528
Carlie cut behind the
miniature golf portion

39:58.596 --> 40:00.196
of the Evie's property.

Joseph Smith pulls in
in the Buick,

40:05.003 --> 40:07.604
in the parking lot
and decides either that

40:07.672 --> 40:10.539
it wasn't a good escape route
or there was no way for him

40:10.609 --> 40:12.742
to get to the back of
the car wash.

40:12.810 --> 40:15.411
[Hallisey]
We can follow the vehicle
through the parking lot,

40:15.413 --> 40:16.879
back out onto Bee Ridge,

40:16.948 --> 40:20.083
slowing down and braking
and coming to a stop,

40:20.085 --> 40:23.152
to turn down
this little side road

40:23.221 --> 40:25.955
that runs right next to
the car wash.

40:26.023 --> 40:28.158
[Schaeffer]
<i>Where we ultimately believe</i>
<i>the car parked</i>

40:28.226 --> 40:31.928
before Joseph Smith got out
to confront Carlie Brucia.

40:32.964 --> 40:35.732
<i>You see a man walking</i>
<i>towards Carlie.</i>

40:38.370 --> 40:40.836
<i>He grabs her arm</i>
<i>in a forceful way.</i>

40:40.906 --> 40:46.109
She was, without a doubt,
being taken away
against her will.

40:46.111 --> 40:49.646
<i>We believe that once</i>
<i>he abducted Carlie and</i>
<i>put her in the car,</i>

40:49.714 --> 40:53.116
<i>he drove the three miles</i>
<i>to where Carlie was killed.</i>

[narrator]<i> DNA, hair and</i>
<i>fiber evidence ties Joseph</i>
<i>Smith to the crime.</i>

41:04.262 --> 41:05.929
<i>But the video was the key.</i>

41:07.198 --> 41:11.133
The surveillance video
allowed us to do in five days

41:11.202 --> 41:13.436
what would have probably
taken us five years.

41:15.473 --> 41:18.941
[Davis]
The surveillance footage
enabled us to find her in time

41:19.010 --> 41:22.846
to save enough
forensics evidence
to convict Joseph Smith.

41:24.415 --> 41:27.350
[Schaeffer] Joseph Smith
was convicted of kidnapping,

41:27.352 --> 41:29.952
sexual battery on a child
under 12,

41:30.021 --> 41:31.654
and also
for first-degree murder.

[narrator]<i> The jury voted</i>

<i>who's walking home</i>
<i>from her friend's house</i>

41:47.838 --> 41:49.372
That case warrants
the death penalty.

41:53.778 --> 41:56.445
[Kate] We've been watching
so many home videos

41:56.514 --> 42:00.316

42:20.338 --> 42:22.205
[Connie] I want Carlie
to be remembered

42:22.207 --> 42:25.742
as this beautiful butterfly

42:25.810 --> 42:29.745
that could make anyone smile
and that she was so caring
