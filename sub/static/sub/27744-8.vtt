00:52.802 --> 00:56.598
So... how does this baby
compare to your yurt?

00:56.681 --> 00:59.142
Similar. Less exploded.

00:59.517 --> 01:01.895
[chuckles]
Oh, I miss yurting.

01:02.437 --> 01:06.608
It's much more honest
than living in a... beach house.

01:06.691 --> 01:09.027
-Huh?
-[sighs]

01:09.110 --> 01:11.196
Now, let's rustle up some breakfast.

01:11.279 --> 01:12.280
Yeah!

01:18.828 --> 01:20.413
[sighs]

01:21.331 --> 01:22.582
Oh.

01:22.665 --> 01:23.875
What a view.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.838
Ah.

01:29.714 --> 01:31.883
And that's why corporations are people.

01:31.966 --> 01:34.344
-What in God's name?
-[Nick] You disagree?

01:34.427 --> 01:37.931
No, Frankie's back
and she's dug up Jerry Garcia.

01:38.598 --> 01:41.351
Grace, Nick. 'Sup?

01:41.434 --> 01:44.479
-'Sup with the tiki-hut?
-What's up with your face?

01:44.562 --> 01:46.898
This is the woman I was telling you about.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.983
I thought you said her hair was snakes.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.485
She has notes on my hair?

01:51.027 --> 01:52.112
My name's Nick.

01:52.195 --> 01:54.030
My hair's hair. My shoes are snakes.

01:54.114 --> 01:55.907
Leo. My shoes are feet.

01:55.990 --> 01:58.451
Now that all the unpleasantries
are done.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.369
No, but really?

01:59.452 --> 02:02.288
You-- You disappear for two days
without so much as a phone call?

02:02.372 --> 02:03.456
I was at the ashram.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.667
I gathered as much
when I called the ashram

02:05.750 --> 02:07.001
and they said you were there.

02:07.085 --> 02:10.463
I needed space to heal
after my harrowing escape

02:10.547 --> 02:12.173
from this spiderweb of lies.

02:12.257 --> 02:16.344
That was my fault. I'm having Dr. Joe
send over some apology acid.

02:16.427 --> 02:19.097
Leo and I are on a trip of our own now,
thanks.

02:19.180 --> 02:21.349
But we never turn down acid.

02:21.432 --> 02:23.643
-Right. Right.
-Hmm.

02:23.726 --> 02:25.937
-Oh, gosh, we are so in step.
-[chuckles]

02:26.437 --> 02:28.398
And you're already sharing clothes.

02:28.481 --> 02:31.943
Along with the portable shanty town.

02:32.026 --> 02:34.279
-Is it a FEMA tent?
-It's a yurt.

02:34.362 --> 02:35.488
It's Leo's.

02:35.572 --> 02:37.574
And the blankets are mostly yours.

02:37.657 --> 02:39.200
So you two are a thing now?

02:39.284 --> 02:42.745
Don't try to slap
your heteronormative cis labels on us.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.373
And yes, we are a thing.

02:45.456 --> 02:49.919
All I know is that this magical woman
shook something loose in me.

02:50.003 --> 02:52.797
Yeah, I'll bet it was loose
before Frankie came on the scene.

02:52.881 --> 02:56.134
Oh, ignore her, Leo. She doesn't get it.
She never will.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.763
And you better have bought
the groceries I like.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.482
-Know what's funny about us?
-Hmm?

03:12.233 --> 03:14.194
We pay the same in taxes.

03:16.404 --> 03:17.447
[Grace] Frankie?

03:18.698 --> 03:22.035
I'm sorry we tried to trick you.
You know, I was worried about you.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.078
Oh, because my hand was tired?

03:24.287 --> 03:25.830
Ta-da!
[sighs]

03:26.122 --> 03:28.458
The only thing
that's a tremor now is my heart.

03:28.541 --> 03:32.045
Yeah, I can see that a lump of patchouli
could do that to you. [inhales]

03:32.128 --> 03:33.713
Look, you just met this guy.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.799
I've known him since I was in pigtails.

03:36.883 --> 03:40.678
-What?
-I rocked pigtails well into my 30s.

03:40.762 --> 03:43.973
Well, how long is Leo's yurt
going to rock my patio?

03:44.057 --> 03:45.600
I hate to break it to you,

03:45.683 --> 03:50.313
but the last time Leo parked it somewhere,
it stayed put for 30 years.

03:50.396 --> 03:52.649
Thank God I'm not gonna live that long.

03:52.732 --> 03:53.900
-Know what, Grace?
-[Grace sighs]

03:53.983 --> 03:56.319
I went to Sambadha looking for something,

03:56.402 --> 03:58.238
and I just may have found it.

03:58.321 --> 03:59.989
In a barefoot guru?

04:00.073 --> 04:01.991
That's how I take my guru.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.743
-Look, I like Leo.
-[sighs]

04:03.826 --> 04:06.537
It's new, and I'd appreciate your support.

04:06.621 --> 04:09.540
Yeah. Like you supported me
when Nick and I were new?

04:09.624 --> 04:13.002
Nick has always been
my favorite Koch brother.

I go to my doctor's office all the time.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.995
No, it's okay. I've been looking
for an excuse to let myself go.

06:53.079 --> 06:55.039
Me too. [chuckles]

06:55.832 --> 06:59.836
So, I have a big question for you.

07:00.336 --> 07:01.462
Are you...

07:02.463 --> 07:05.591
Are you gonna ask me to be the godfather?
Because that is an a--

07:05.675 --> 07:08.428
-Don't do your Marlon Brando impression.
-I've been working on it.

07:08.511 --> 07:09.804
-It's better.
-[sighs]

07:09.887 --> 07:11.973
I've heard you. It is not.

07:12.515 --> 07:16.269
I'm actually asking you to be the father.

07:17.770 --> 07:18.604
What?

07:19.856 --> 07:23.025
I'm sorry. I'm the slightest bit drunk.
What did you just say?

07:24.735 --> 07:28.781
Liz and I would like your sperm.

07:38.207 --> 07:41.002
Robert, you have guests,
they can hear you swearing in here.

07:41.085 --> 07:43.337
Well, I don't give a flippin' dang!

07:43.421 --> 07:46.632
Are you being perhaps
just a tad immature?

07:46.716 --> 07:48.676
If I were, I'd fit in better.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.970
So it's a younger crowd...
[tap running]

07:51.053 --> 07:52.638
they speak a different language.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.807
If you wanted, you could win them over.

07:54.891 --> 07:57.643
With what?
A sailor suit and a giant lollipop?

07:57.727 --> 07:59.520
That would get their attention.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.106
But I was thinking
of something more like drinkies.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.441
Whatever happened to drinkies?

08:03.524 --> 08:08.529
Well, when Peter got his third DUI,
we thought it best to put a pin in it.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.114
So, take the pin out.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.659
Don't know. I'm pretty sure
he's banned from all the ride-share apps.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.204
Then it's decided. We'll host.

08:16.287 --> 08:18.915
Now... go back out there, Robert.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.625
Go get 'em!

08:21.250 --> 08:24.837
Good gracious, Sol. You sound
like a high school football coach.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.589
Miss Schutzer.

08:27.548 --> 08:29.592
I wonder whatever happened to her.

08:30.676 --> 08:32.261
So this is how Leo sees Frankie.

08:33.679 --> 08:35.389
She said it's her essence.

08:35.473 --> 08:37.642
Her essence is leaking
all over your floor.

08:37.725 --> 08:38.768
Well, then he nailed it.

08:38.851 --> 08:40.853
-[Nick] Oh.
-[Grace] Oh.

08:43.314 --> 08:44.857
Oh, God.

08:51.072 --> 08:52.573
-[Leo] Oh, my God!
-[Frankie, Leo laughing]

08:52.657 --> 08:54.825
There's a naked hippie in my pool.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.536
At least he's getting a rinse.

08:56.619 --> 08:58.287
We're surrounded on all sides.

08:58.371 --> 09:00.456
A circus tent
blocking my ocean view

09:00.540 --> 09:03.459
and this diphtheria epidemic
in my courtyard.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.711
So let's stay at my places
for a few days.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.463
-Give them some space.
-[clang]

09:07.547 --> 09:09.715
I'm worried she'll explode something.

09:10.550 --> 09:12.552
And if history is any indicator,

09:12.635 --> 09:15.930
the beach house is
well within the yurt's blast radius.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.266
Why are you so worked up?
Frankie met her match.

09:18.349 --> 09:21.310
If she has someone...
it could be good for us.

09:21.686 --> 09:24.146
Yeah, but it may not be good for her.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.941
Doesn't he set off your bullshit detector?

09:27.024 --> 09:29.694
No more than Frankie does,
and she's harmless.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.279
Yeah, but I know Frankie.

09:31.362 --> 09:33.322
I don't know him at all.

09:34.240 --> 09:37.118
The last time we questioned her judgment,
it only pissed her off.

09:37.201 --> 09:38.828
Let's get to know the guy.

09:38.911 --> 09:41.414
Maybe you'll warm up to him
like Frankie warmed up to me.

09:41.497 --> 09:44.792
You know who else she warmed up to?
Jim Jones!

09:44.875 --> 09:47.044
-She's low-hanging fruit!
-Hey.

09:47.920 --> 09:50.006
You might be right to worry.
We don't know Leo.

09:50.089 --> 09:53.593
But I do know that if you don't cool it,
Frankie ends up with him...

09:53.676 --> 09:54.927
[Frankie laughing in distance]

09:55.011 --> 09:56.012
I know.

09:56.846 --> 09:57.847
I could lose her.

09:58.222 --> 09:59.640
So give him a chance.

10:00.016 --> 10:01.559
[Leo] Cannonball!

10:01.642 --> 10:02.727
[water splashes]

10:02.810 --> 10:04.937
Well, now we know he's not circumcised.

10:05.021 --> 10:06.689
There's your icebreaker.

10:06.772 --> 10:07.773
[laughs]

10:08.774 --> 10:12.236
Thanks, all, for this
marginally productive use of our time.

10:14.697 --> 10:16.157
Uh... Uh, fellas.

10:16.657 --> 10:20.745
If all of you are free
after rehearsal tomorrow night,

10:20.828 --> 10:22.830
how would you like
to come over for drinkies?

10:24.707 --> 10:27.877
It's a New Lear Theatre tradition...
of drinking. [chuckles]

10:27.960 --> 10:29.420
Too much, some might say.

10:29.503 --> 10:32.757
And in Peter's case,
the state of California would agree.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.176
And Nevada. I'm in.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.553
Alcohol does numb my leg pain.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.805
Shall we say eight o'clock?

10:39.889 --> 10:41.849
So I love the area that we're in here,

10:41.932 --> 10:43.392
but guess who's making
a surprise appearance

10:43.476 --> 10:45.436
tomorrow night at Club Rampage?
It's Ke$ha!

10:45.519 --> 10:47.813
Shut up! Ke$ha's my Britney!

10:47.897 --> 10:51.025
Yeah. So, drinkies with Ke$ha?

10:51.984 --> 10:54.987
But... parking is free here.

10:55.071 --> 10:56.822
Everything is free here.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.658
And there's parking.

10:58.741 --> 11:01.285
Robert, it's Ke$ha.
Stop sleeping on Ke$ha!

11:01.369 --> 11:02.620
[mouths]
You're going.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.705
[chuckles]

11:05.373 --> 11:07.458
Ke$ha is a recording artist, yes?

11:08.417 --> 11:10.503
I can't tell if you're joking or sad.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.630
Yes.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.137
Mmm.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.765
I want to meet the wizard

11:22.848 --> 11:27.144
that made that chicken parmigiana
out of vegetables and bird seed.

11:27.603 --> 11:30.022
I just want to meet any wizard.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.108
Oh, you have powers of your own.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.652
You pushed a button on a phone,

11:34.735 --> 11:37.363
20 minutes later,
this vegan feast appeared.

11:37.446 --> 11:39.740
It's called Postmates and I invented it,

11:39.824 --> 11:44.120
but I didn't tell anyone I invented it,
so then someone else did.

11:45.413 --> 11:47.623
If I knew all this was a button away...

11:47.707 --> 11:49.208
Oh.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.752
That's why I've gone soft.

11:52.461 --> 11:55.589
I've been sleeping with the enemy
and eating with the enemy

11:55.673 --> 11:57.508
and letting the enemy do my taxes.

11:57.591 --> 11:59.135
Don't be so hard on yourself.

11:59.218 --> 12:02.805
You didn't have the spartan life
of the ashram to keep you honest.

12:02.888 --> 12:08.477
Well, something has got to snap me out
of this beautiful bourgeois nightmare.

12:08.561 --> 12:10.896
Something's got to keep me
from getting lured into it,

12:10.980 --> 12:13.190
'cause I'm really
getting into<i> Ray Donovan.</i>

12:13.274 --> 12:16.110
-Oh, well, Liev Schreiber is so...
-Oh!

12:16.193 --> 12:18.946
...multi-talented and hand--
-Yeah, yeah.

12:19.655 --> 12:21.699
Nice try, Satan!

12:22.408 --> 12:23.492
-Damn it.
-[groans]

12:23.576 --> 12:26.412
If we want our lives
to be about something bigger,

12:27.079 --> 12:30.416
we need to drill down
to what's most important to us.

12:30.499 --> 12:33.461
[sighs] How can we do that?

12:37.506 --> 12:38.966
Cacao.

12:40.092 --> 12:41.719
Hell yes.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.900
I was just doing the exact same thing
at my desk. [chuckles]

12:55.983 --> 12:59.153
Well, I don't pay you
to play with fidget spinners.

12:59.653 --> 13:01.739
I haven't paid myself in many months.

13:01.822 --> 13:05.534
Of course you haven't. That's why
everyone wants to have a baby with you.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.786
[scoffs]

13:07.036 --> 13:10.873
Look... I get that this is a big deal.

13:10.956 --> 13:13.083
It's a big deal.

13:13.167 --> 13:14.752
Erin is my oldest friend.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.003
Thought your mom
was your oldest friend.

13:16.086 --> 13:18.589
For your information,
my dad is my oldest friend,

13:18.672 --> 13:20.591
my mom is my first girlfriend.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.302
Boy, who wouldn't want
your genetic material?

13:23.385 --> 13:27.515
Oh, come on. I'm tall. I'm smart.
And technically, I have two girlfriends.

13:27.598 --> 13:31.018
Okay, what happens when this kid
grows up and asks who their father is?

13:31.811 --> 13:33.229
You heard Erin.
[stammers]

13:33.312 --> 13:34.730
I'm Uncle Barry.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.899
I'm only as involved as I want to be.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.192
You're always involved.

13:38.275 --> 13:40.528
You're on the neighborhood watch
for places you don't live.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.947
You always have time
for anyone with a clipboard.

13:43.030 --> 13:43.864
They work so hard.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.075
You'll teach this girl
how to play catch

13:46.158 --> 13:48.369
or buy this little boy his first dress.

13:48.452 --> 13:49.954
What about when he grows up?

13:51.831 --> 13:54.375
This is a fuck-ton to ask of someone.

13:54.458 --> 13:56.627
I know it's a fuck-ton to ask of you.

13:56.710 --> 13:58.295
So don't do it.

13:58.754 --> 14:02.007
Look, when we got together for real,

14:03.300 --> 14:06.929
I took the idea of having kids,
tucked it away on a shelf in the garage.

14:07.012 --> 14:10.558
And I'm okay with that
because I want to be with you.

14:12.726 --> 14:15.479
You have no idea how much
I appreciate you doing that for me.

14:15.938 --> 14:17.940
But now I have this chance to,

14:18.566 --> 14:20.276
in some small way,

14:20.359 --> 14:21.610
be a dad.

14:23.529 --> 14:25.406
And it might be my only shot.

14:31.662 --> 14:33.372
Has the space been cleansed?

14:33.455 --> 14:36.959
Spiritually, yes, but the wine stain
that looks like Ernest Borgnine

14:37.042 --> 14:38.836
is there for life, I'm afraid.

14:38.919 --> 14:41.755
-I have the sacred vessel.
-Oh.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.550
-Did you wash the chili out of it?
-Yes.

14:44.633 --> 14:47.553
Did you by chance do all the dishes?

14:47.845 --> 14:48.804
[chuckles]

14:50.639 --> 14:53.100
[whispers] They haven't seen us.
Quick, let's jump out the window.

14:53.183 --> 14:55.728
Come on. You can do this.

14:58.105 --> 14:59.106
[clicks tongue]

14:59.773 --> 15:02.568
Well, what's going on here?

15:02.651 --> 15:04.445
You having a fondue party?

15:04.528 --> 15:07.448
Oh, Grace. What you don't know
could fill your crystal vase,

15:07.531 --> 15:09.950
which I broke earlier today
and I'm sorry.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.621
That's okay, I'm sure another one
of my grandmothers will die.

15:14.371 --> 15:15.706
Anyway...

15:16.582 --> 15:17.458
[inhales]

15:17.917 --> 15:20.878
We were hoping the two of you
would join us for dinner tonight.

15:20.961 --> 15:23.172
You know, at that very nice
vegan place on the shore.

15:23.255 --> 15:25.257
Postmates? It's delicious.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.927
Unfortunately, it's called Branch.

15:28.010 --> 15:30.888
Unfortunately, it's called Bark.
I heard Moby eats there.

15:30.971 --> 15:34.934
Oh, yes, I know. I've seen
the blurry pictures of him on Yelp.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.852
-So?
-We can't.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.938
We're having a cacao ceremony.

15:39.021 --> 15:39.855
That's our cue.

15:39.939 --> 15:42.483
To say that sounds like fun and...

15:43.108 --> 15:44.443
[Grace sighs]

15:46.236 --> 15:48.364
Maybe we could join you.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.449
For a journey into your soul?

15:50.532 --> 15:54.203
Man, you must really want
to get back on my good side.

15:54.286 --> 15:57.414
Lady Cacao does welcome all searchers.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.124
Then it's a date. Super!

15:59.208 --> 16:02.252
So what do we do?
Stick our hands in it or what?

16:02.336 --> 16:04.505
Your mind hands.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.048
Oh, fuck.

16:06.924 --> 16:09.385
[Leo]
This is ceremonial-grade cacao:

16:09.468 --> 16:11.136
raw, bitter,

16:11.220 --> 16:13.347
and blessed in the ancient Mayan tradition

16:14.181 --> 16:15.432
by Shaman Brad.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.101
So, it's chocolate.

16:17.184 --> 16:19.061
Great, I'm a fiend.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.648
I stash Godiva bars on all my help,
just to have it on hand.

16:22.731 --> 16:26.568
If you both are done,
Lady Cacao would like your attention.

16:26.652 --> 16:30.739
Before we drink, we must each
set an intention for our lives.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.116
A what?

16:32.199 --> 16:35.160
Just write down something you want
and stick it in the bowl.

16:39.373 --> 16:40.249
[sighs]

16:41.000 --> 16:43.043
Hope I got this ratio right.

16:43.127 --> 16:45.713
The last time I did this,
it was for 400 people.

16:45.796 --> 16:49.341
-Are any of those people still alive?
-[Leo] A good amount.

16:53.804 --> 16:55.472
To Lady Cacao.

17:00.561 --> 17:03.313
Wait. Anything in here
will interfere with my statins?

17:03.397 --> 17:06.525
This is drug free and non-psychoactive.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.486
Yep, totally cool.

17:10.154 --> 17:10.988
[Nick] Hmm.

17:12.990 --> 17:15.367
[club music playing]

17:15.451 --> 17:17.327
[overlapping chatter]

17:21.999 --> 17:25.127
Y'all, I just found this molly
on the floor of the party bus!

17:25.210 --> 17:26.795
I'm gonna take it! [laughs]

17:27.880 --> 17:29.840
[indistinct voices]

17:29.923 --> 17:32.342
-My God.
-Robert, you made it!

17:32.426 --> 17:36.638
Yes, I should have known the entrance
would be an unmarked door in an alley.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.558
A break-dancing twink kicked me
in the head. It was incredible.

17:39.641 --> 17:40.976
It sounds great.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.063
Someone threw up on a table, but
as soon as they clean it off, it's ours.

17:44.146 --> 17:47.941
I'll be right in.
I'm just going to take some "Polly."

17:48.233 --> 17:49.401
[whispers]
Okay.

17:54.823 --> 17:57.951
Hey, Daddy, can I direct you
to the grown-ups' table?

17:58.035 --> 17:59.912
[muffled music playing]

18:01.413 --> 18:03.415
[indistinct song playing]

18:12.841 --> 18:14.009
[man 1]
Oh, no, don't be fooled!

18:14.093 --> 18:15.427
Bar's open.

18:15.511 --> 18:17.888
Newcomers get a free cheeseburger
with their first drink.

18:18.806 --> 18:21.308
Can I have a scotch on the rocks, please?

18:27.689 --> 18:30.776
You know,
they were roommates for 12 years.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.694
"Confirmed bachelors."

18:32.778 --> 18:36.907
I understand Cary Grant confirmed things
with a few handsome bachelors.

18:36.990 --> 18:39.159
Some of those confirmations
began right here.

18:39.243 --> 18:41.203
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

18:41.954 --> 18:43.122
[Robert] Well, I'll be.

18:46.750 --> 18:50.587
Have you by any chance
ever heard of Fernando Lamas?

18:50.671 --> 18:51.547
Oh, sure.

18:51.630 --> 18:54.466
I was so jealous
of his affair with Lana Turner

18:54.550 --> 18:58.303
that I gave her a mustache
in my Legends of Hollywood calendar.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.639
My mother took my copy away.

19:00.722 --> 19:03.892
Didn't work, Ma.
I'm talking to a man in leather.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.812
[knocking on door]

19:10.315 --> 19:11.150
-Hi.
-Hi.

19:11.233 --> 19:12.943
Is my dad here?
He's not answering his phone,

19:13.026 --> 19:15.195
and I need someone to tell me
it's okay to be selfish.

19:15.279 --> 19:17.156
I'm afraid he's at a club.

19:20.450 --> 19:22.369
Sorry, I asked where my dad is.

19:22.452 --> 19:25.247
An outing with his theater group.
They're seeing Ke$ha!

19:26.707 --> 19:27.749
Okay.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.420
-Bye, Sol.
-No, no, what's going on?

19:31.879 --> 19:33.922
Just-- [sighs]

19:34.423 --> 19:39.219
You know, Barry's friend asked for
his sperm and I'm gonna go kill myself.

19:39.303 --> 19:40.888
Oh, that old chestnut.

19:40.971 --> 19:42.598
Yeah, so...

19:44.683 --> 19:46.810
-Anyway...
-Want to see my new dog?

19:46.894 --> 19:48.270
No, thank you.

19:48.854 --> 19:52.566
-Want to break into your dad's scotch?
-Yes.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.360
I'll take a peek at that dog, too.

20:05.954 --> 20:09.541
Oh, thank you for going with me
on that Five Elements Dance journey.

20:09.625 --> 20:12.002
And thank you
for putting your fingers in my mouth.

20:12.085 --> 20:13.378
That was a little weird.

20:13.462 --> 20:16.840
Now that our hearts are open,
time to share our life intentions.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.885
Oh, I [stammering]
wasn't aware we were sharing.

20:19.968 --> 20:24.765
Well, it would be a pretty stupid ceremony
if we didn't read them aloud, Grace.

20:24.848 --> 20:26.725
Oh, that's the stupid part.
[scoffs]

20:26.808 --> 20:28.810
Just for that, you're gonna go first.

20:30.604 --> 20:32.856
No, I'll go.

20:33.690 --> 20:34.900
[Nick groans]

20:37.861 --> 20:40.405
"I'd love to get the SEC off my back."

20:40.489 --> 20:42.032
Why is the SEC on your back?

20:42.115 --> 20:43.992
'Cause they're a bunch of nerds.

20:44.076 --> 20:49.623
Wow, I've never heard the SEC
mentioned in a cacao ceremony before.

20:49.706 --> 20:51.959
I thought this
was supposed to be a safe space.

20:52.042 --> 20:55.921
Leo is just not used
to breaking bread with capitalists.

20:56.004 --> 20:59.132
Is there bread? 'Cause I got to say,
this chocolate isn't sitting right.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.676
None of this is sitting right.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.011
-Let me show you how it's done.
-[sighs]

21:03.512 --> 21:08.475
"I want to start living a life
I will be proud of in the end."

21:09.559 --> 21:11.270
What's that supposed to mean?

21:11.353 --> 21:13.272
Maybe I've taken a wrong turn.

21:13.355 --> 21:14.564
You mean with me?

21:14.648 --> 21:16.066
I'm the wrong turn you took?

21:16.149 --> 21:17.734
I'm just being honest.

21:17.818 --> 21:19.945
You want to see honesty?

21:21.280 --> 21:25.117
"I want to get through this caca ceremony
without killing Frankie."

21:27.327 --> 21:31.456
I'm gonna take Leo outside and explain
to him why it's better to be outside.

21:32.165 --> 21:33.125
Now that you're up.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.043
[Leo groans]

21:36.628 --> 21:37.462
Thanks a lot.

21:37.546 --> 21:38.630
Oh, I'm sorry!

21:38.714 --> 21:41.008
Am I doing your bullshit ceremony wrong?

21:41.091 --> 21:45.971
Am I losing points because I didn't bring
my own dirty yurt or seeping bust?

21:46.054 --> 21:50.600
No, you're losing points because you
don't take me seriously, as is your wont.

21:50.684 --> 21:53.353
No, Frankie, what I don't take seriously

21:53.437 --> 21:56.315
is looking for answers
in terrible chocolate.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.734
I take you very seriously.

21:59.234 --> 22:02.279
Then why can't you understand
I'm searching for something?

22:02.362 --> 22:06.533
I do. I just don't understand why you're
searching for it everywhere but here.

22:06.616 --> 22:08.493
If it were here,
I would've found it already.

22:08.577 --> 22:11.705
You can't even find your glasses
when they're on top of your head!

22:11.788 --> 22:15.250
I'm talking about something with meaning.
Something that matters.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.294
I thought you and I
were doing something with meaning.

22:17.377 --> 22:20.547
You know, I thought helping
older women masturbate mattered.

22:20.630 --> 22:21.798
It does.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.383
I thought we mattered.

22:23.467 --> 22:24.593
We do.

22:24.676 --> 22:27.179
Well, then stop acting like we don't.

22:34.019 --> 22:37.105
Have Erin and her wife
considered a sperm bank?

22:37.189 --> 22:40.317
Nah, they want to know the guy,
which, I guess, is a thing.

22:40.400 --> 22:41.610
Barry's a catch.

22:42.194 --> 22:46.865
He's so nice and funny and tall.
What is he, six-foot-four?

22:46.948 --> 22:50.077
Sol, I already have lesbians
after him. Don't need you as well.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.287
He wants to do this though, right?

22:53.163 --> 22:57.125
Yes, but Barry also thought he wanted
to be a fedora guy for a while.

22:57.209 --> 22:58.627
Oh, God, I remember.

22:58.752 --> 23:01.088
[inhales]
Maybe show Erin some pictures of that?

23:01.171 --> 23:02.672
Erin. Agh.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.633
I hope she gets hit by a plane.

23:05.592 --> 23:07.427
Sorry, I didn't mean that.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.680
Why do I all of a sudden hate this woman?
I've always liked her.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.391
She knows how to bag on Barry.

23:12.474 --> 23:14.768
'Cause this is a primal thing
you're dealing with.

23:14.851 --> 23:17.270
And I've been
all caught up in that before.

23:17.771 --> 23:21.066
When Frankie and I were trying
to have kids and couldn't...

23:21.149 --> 23:24.236
it almost broke us up.
We didn't know where to turn.

23:24.319 --> 23:27.030
See? Exactly. It's the kind of stuff
that breaks people up.

23:27.114 --> 23:32.411
And if Barry does this for Erin,
they will share this crazy bond.

23:32.494 --> 23:34.246
And I'll always be on the outside.

23:34.329 --> 23:35.664
No, you won't.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.707
Because you and Barry will always have

23:37.791 --> 23:40.210
this incredible thing
that you did for him.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.842
It'd be pretty incredible of me, huh?

23:46.925 --> 23:48.260
Yes, it would.

23:48.802 --> 23:51.638
Never been the generous one
in a relationship before.

23:51.721 --> 23:53.557
And you still won't be.

23:53.640 --> 23:54.683
Good.

23:58.979 --> 24:01.148
She totally<i> Wizard of Oz'd</i> me.

24:01.231 --> 24:05.735
It turns out the thing I was looking for
was here the whole time.

24:05.819 --> 24:07.320
Cacao never lies.

24:07.404 --> 24:08.447
I know.

24:09.406 --> 24:11.450
We never read your intention.

24:11.533 --> 24:15.245
It was,
"I want to help Frankie find her way."

24:15.328 --> 24:16.621
Oh.

24:17.414 --> 24:18.248
You did.

24:18.331 --> 24:20.500
I guess my work is done here.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.752
Sambadha is calling.

24:23.211 --> 24:25.046
I want to give you something.

24:28.967 --> 24:30.343
Your left eye.

24:31.094 --> 24:33.597
In gratitude for bringing me to clarity.

24:33.972 --> 24:36.516
Thank you. That is really moving.

24:37.851 --> 24:40.854
Of course, you realize I can't hang it
'cause I don't have any walls.

24:40.937 --> 24:42.647
Well, then give it back to me.

24:44.065 --> 24:46.318
-I couldn't possibly...
-Oh!

24:52.991 --> 24:54.993
[indistinct song playing]

24:57.662 --> 25:00.999
I notice I'm not in vogue
with the dress code here.

25:01.082 --> 25:03.251
May I ask how you came to leather?

25:04.002 --> 25:07.172
Most of my life
I was treated as if I wasn't a real man

25:07.255 --> 25:09.174
because I like men.

25:09.257 --> 25:11.593
Then a few years ago,
a friend introduced me to this,

25:11.676 --> 25:14.179
and it just felt right.

25:14.262 --> 25:17.307
I was finally able
to express my masculinity

25:17.390 --> 25:19.309
in a way that made sense to me.

25:19.392 --> 25:21.853
I guess I'm making up for lost time now.

25:21.937 --> 25:24.481
Well, theater was my leather...

25:24.564 --> 25:27.692
until my junior thespian friends

25:27.776 --> 25:30.654
-tried to take me to Rampage.
-Ow!

25:30.737 --> 25:33.406
That place isn't for anyone
who remembers both Darrins.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.491
It certainly wasn't for me.

25:34.574 --> 25:37.160
Ah, let the young enjoy their youth.

25:37.244 --> 25:40.205
As long as I can enjoy my old age
in a place like this.

25:40.288 --> 25:42.499
You should have seen this in its heyday.

25:42.582 --> 25:44.125
-Really?
-Oh, yeah.

25:44.209 --> 25:47.295
There was a big piano
and everyone would sing and dance.

25:47.379 --> 25:49.089
-The worse, the better.
-[laughs]

25:49.172 --> 25:51.800
-He says that because he was the worse.
-[laughs]

25:53.218 --> 25:55.387
Boy, I wish I was here then.

25:55.470 --> 25:59.849
Of course, I would have been
one of those confirmed bachelors.

25:59.933 --> 26:02.018
But it's nice the way it is now, too.

26:02.102 --> 26:04.437
Well, enjoy it while you still can.

26:04.521 --> 26:06.231
It's closing down for good next month.

26:06.648 --> 26:09.109
No, I live here now.

26:14.489 --> 26:15.574
[door slams]

26:16.408 --> 26:17.784
Oh.

26:17.867 --> 26:19.536
-[Frankie] Uh-oh! Uh-oh!
-[clattering]

26:19.619 --> 26:21.580
A little help, please!

26:21.663 --> 26:23.456
What the hell are you doing?

26:23.540 --> 26:25.000
What does it look like?

26:25.083 --> 26:28.044
I'm putting my head
down the garbage disposal.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.629
-[machine stops]
-[sighs]

26:29.713 --> 26:31.256
Let me do the honors.

26:31.339 --> 26:33.383
Be my guest.
[exhales]

26:33.466 --> 26:35.885
Oh, no! We have to do it right.

26:38.096 --> 26:40.765
Goodbye, head. Goodbye, head.

26:41.224 --> 26:42.267
Now you.

26:43.018 --> 26:45.520
Goodbye, head. Goodbye, head.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.605
[both sigh]

26:50.650 --> 26:54.029
Ah! It was really an amazing likeness.

26:54.112 --> 26:55.905
I see the yurt's gone.

26:55.989 --> 26:59.034
And with it,
its most enigmatic inhabitant.

27:00.160 --> 27:01.494
Are you okay with that?

27:01.578 --> 27:03.330
It was time for him to go.

27:03.413 --> 27:05.373
Thank you for kicking me in the ass.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.542
Hey, I'm ready to kick anytime.

27:07.626 --> 27:08.627
[Frankie chuckles]

27:08.710 --> 27:11.880
You do realize that
you've destroyed our disposal, right?

27:11.963 --> 27:15.342
Goodbye, head. Goodbye, head.
Goodbye, head. Goodbye, head.

27:16.551 --> 27:19.846
Goodbye, head.
Goodbye, head. Goodbye, head.
