<i>Previously on
Shades Of Blue...</i>

00:01.593 --> 00:03.096
I heard shots.
They sounded real.

00:03.170 --> 00:04.393
A videogame?

00:04.511 --> 00:05.543
I gotta make this right.

00:05.645 --> 00:07.427
Wozniak's been taking pay-offs.

00:07.519 --> 00:09.716
Provided your cooperation
leads to conviction,

00:09.812 --> 00:11.255
we'll grant you full
immunity.

00:11.343 --> 00:13.495
There's a rat on my team!

00:13.587 --> 00:14.568
He threatened to kill me.

00:14.658 --> 00:17.073
The man you're framing,
Miguel Zepeda,

00:17.155 --> 00:19.498
the paper trail
leads right back to you.

00:19.595 --> 00:20.809
It's a big mistake.

00:20.911 --> 00:22.464
We should polygraph the crew.

00:22.552 --> 00:24.436
I'll just clear you tonight, Harlee.

00:26.418 --> 00:28.728
Are you an informant for the FBI?

00:28.955 --> 00:29.929
No.

00:30.441 --> 00:34.076
<i>Did you plant the knife
in Miguel Zepeda's car?</i>

00:34.078 --> 00:36.312
<i>No.</i>

00:36.314 --> 00:38.747
<i>No.</i>

00:50.627 --> 00:53.628
What happened to your arm?

00:55.232 --> 00:57.098
Nothing.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.634
I got burned on the stove.

00:59.636 --> 01:00.836
You're up early.

01:00.838 --> 01:02.971
Figured I'd get the lecture
over with

01:02.973 --> 01:05.006
for going out last night.

01:07.244 --> 01:08.777
Mom, what is going on?

01:08.779 --> 01:11.046
Be careful.

01:11.048 --> 01:15.217
Just-- just go with it.

01:15.219 --> 01:18.920
I'm not five anymore,
you know.

01:18.922 --> 01:20.889
Pretend that you are.

01:24.328 --> 01:26.127
FBI. Detective Santos?

01:26.129 --> 01:28.830
We need you to come with us.

01:28.832 --> 01:30.999
My daughter is here.

01:31.001 --> 01:32.567
Mom, who is it?

01:32.569 --> 01:35.604
Nothing, baby.
It's just a work thing.

01:37.674 --> 01:40.475
Give me ten minutes.

01:40.777 --> 01:43.378
Mom, what's going on?

01:43.380 --> 01:46.281
I'm, um,
consulting on a case.

01:46.283 --> 01:47.649
You know, on the side.

01:47.651 --> 01:49.350
Extra credit.

01:49.352 --> 01:51.452
But don't tell Woz.

01:51.454 --> 01:53.688
He already thinks
I work too much.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:09.205 --> 02:12.507
Couldn't sleep?

02:13.009 --> 02:15.943
I woke up,
and you weren't there.

02:15.945 --> 02:18.179
Tell me I shouldn't worry.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.547
Does that ever work?

02:19.549 --> 02:22.717
I had that dream
about Anna again.

02:22.719 --> 02:24.518
The day the two of you were
coloring

02:24.520 --> 02:27.021
on yellow
construction paper,

02:27.023 --> 02:30.391
she asked you if she could
make the Sun green

02:30.393 --> 02:33.427
because yellow
wouldn't show up.

02:33.429 --> 02:35.730
And you smiled and said

02:35.732 --> 02:38.265
you don't remember ever
seeing a green Sun.

02:38.267 --> 02:40.568
- But some--
- But someday I'd like to.

02:46.275 --> 02:49.676
It's hard not to go back
and think about

02:49.678 --> 02:52.913
what could have
happened differently.

02:52.915 --> 02:57.517
She was 19
and clinically depressed.

02:57.519 --> 03:01.688
I shouldn't have argued
with her that day.

03:01.690 --> 03:05.525
She knew you'd forgive her.

03:05.527 --> 03:09.663
Daughters make mistakes;
fathers forgive.

03:09.665 --> 03:11.698
That's how it works.

03:24.446 --> 03:26.179
Hello, Harlee.

03:26.181 --> 03:28.548
Wish I were seeing you again
under different circumstances.

03:28.550 --> 03:30.217
You're behind this?

03:30.219 --> 03:31.718
I approved
the operation, yeah.

03:31.720 --> 03:33.620
Did you approve them picking
me up in front of my kid?

03:33.622 --> 03:35.922
I hate that this affects
Cristina; I really do.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.825
But you have an opportunity
to make her proud here, Harlee.

03:38.827 --> 03:40.226
You were good police once.

03:40.228 --> 03:41.494
I'm good police now.

03:41.496 --> 03:43.663
I need you to answer me
truthfully, then.

03:43.665 --> 03:45.231
You want to tell me
why I wasn't notified

03:45.233 --> 03:46.532
that my asset
was just picked up?

03:46.534 --> 03:48.267
Stand down.

03:48.769 --> 03:50.269
Detective Santos, do you know
about Wozniak

03:50.271 --> 03:52.071
accepting payment
in casino chips?

03:52.073 --> 03:53.539
- Nope.
- Agent Baker.

03:53.541 --> 03:55.808
May we step outside
and talk alone, please?

03:55.810 --> 03:58.077
No. Detective Santos, you have
the right to remain silent.

03:58.079 --> 03:59.745
Anything you do or say will be
used against you--

03:59.747 --> 04:00.980
- Oh, come on.
- I know my rights, Gail.

04:00.982 --> 04:03.282
I gave you 24 hours
to find that leak, Stahl!

04:03.284 --> 04:04.283
We need more time!

04:04.285 --> 04:06.085
We don't think
there is a leak.

04:06.087 --> 04:07.686
Here.

04:07.688 --> 04:09.688
When your tech
pulled the NYPD personnel files,

04:09.690 --> 04:12.191
digital fingerprints were left
on the precinct's computer.

04:12.193 --> 04:13.559
Think of it
like library books.

04:13.561 --> 04:16.495
This shows that we've
checked them out.

04:16.497 --> 04:17.997
If Wozniak's keeping tabs,

04:17.999 --> 04:20.165
he might easily assume
that there's a mole,

04:20.166 --> 04:22.301
but he doesn't actually know
anything.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.702
It's true.

04:23.704 --> 04:25.638
He polygraphed me.

04:25.640 --> 04:27.740
And if Wozniak knew
I was betraying him--

04:27.742 --> 04:30.042
What? Finish the sentence.

04:30.044 --> 04:32.311
- He'd kill you?
- I don't know that.

04:32.313 --> 04:33.846
Too big a risk for a theory.

04:33.848 --> 04:36.949
Look, it's not
just a theory.

04:37.351 --> 04:39.851
He's been talking
about something big going down,

04:39.853 --> 04:41.787
more money.

04:41.789 --> 04:44.856
And I can tell he's nervous.

04:44.858 --> 04:46.725
Stahl is right.

04:46.727 --> 04:49.261
So we're getting this
information when it suits you?

04:49.263 --> 04:52.397
No more games.

04:52.399 --> 04:54.332
I can't go to jail.

04:54.334 --> 04:57.235
Cristina needs me, Gail.

04:57.237 --> 04:58.870
One more day.

04:58.872 --> 05:00.972
I want something real.

05:04.611 --> 05:05.977
- Come on.
- What?

05:05.979 --> 05:07.679
What happened to you?
I called you a half hour ago.

05:07.681 --> 05:09.714
And I left potential
morning sex to get here.

05:09.716 --> 05:11.683
You know how long it's been
since I had morning sex?

05:11.685 --> 05:13.384
Makes leap year
feel like next Tuesday.

05:13.386 --> 05:14.786
Lower your voice.
It's early in the morning.

05:14.788 --> 05:15.987
You're a cheer captain?

05:15.989 --> 05:17.255
Hey. Hey,
you want help with your trash?

05:17.257 --> 05:18.723
- Ask your husband.
- I don't need help with trash.

05:18.725 --> 05:22.227
I need help with this.
Behind my house.

05:22.229 --> 05:24.495
Tess, what the hell?

05:24.497 --> 05:26.831
- Did you kill him?
- No, I moved him.

05:26.833 --> 05:28.233
He was over there.

05:28.235 --> 05:30.301
Please tell me you have a very
good reason for doing that.

05:33.807 --> 05:36.040
Hey.

05:36.042 --> 05:38.876
Hey.
Good morning, Harlee.

05:38.878 --> 05:40.745
Breakfast is on me.

05:40.747 --> 05:44.515
Thank you for putting up
with last night.

05:44.517 --> 05:47.085
Getting off cheap.

05:47.087 --> 05:48.419
So what's the next move?

05:48.421 --> 05:49.921
I don't know.
I don't know.

05:49.923 --> 05:51.956
I haven't figured it out yet.

05:51.958 --> 05:54.926
What's this big new job
you keep talking about?

05:54.928 --> 05:56.527
The Julliard money.

05:56.529 --> 05:58.896
Now, I know I-I can't
keep borrowing from you,

05:58.898 --> 06:02.267
but if someone's talking
to the feds...

06:02.269 --> 06:06.404
Yeah.
I'll handle it before that.

06:06.406 --> 06:08.573
What--
what is this thing, Woz?

06:08.575 --> 06:11.142
Harlee,
I said I'll handle it.

06:13.380 --> 06:15.713
We got another problem.

06:15.715 --> 06:19.684
A public defender got hit
with ineffective assistance.

06:20.086 --> 06:23.854
Half the people he represented
are looking for a retrial.

06:23.856 --> 06:25.690
One of those people--

06:25.692 --> 06:27.758
Miguel Zepeda.

06:30.396 --> 06:31.729
Who told you?

06:31.731 --> 06:33.631
The new ADA, Nava.

06:33.633 --> 06:36.434
He asked me to pull
relevant case files.

06:36.436 --> 06:40.337
I'm thinking that you should
probably bring them to him--

06:40.339 --> 06:43.441
you know, make sure
we keep him invested.

06:43.443 --> 06:44.642
Miguel could get out?

06:44.644 --> 06:46.711
He's got to have
legitimate cause.

06:50.049 --> 06:53.884
What we did,
is it gonna hold up in court?

06:53.886 --> 06:57.621
As long as I'm there
to testify,

06:57.623 --> 07:00.624
yeah,
nobody'll know anything.

07:00.626 --> 07:03.661
And Cristina won't know
he's her father.

07:09.001 --> 07:13.204
Woz,
you got to promise me.

07:13.206 --> 07:14.772
Promise me
that if I go down,

07:14.774 --> 07:17.608
you and Linda will take care
of Cristina for me.

07:17.610 --> 07:22.246
Harlee, of course we will.

07:22.248 --> 07:23.714
Nothing's gonna
happen to you.

07:23.716 --> 07:25.816
You're not gonna go to jail.

07:28.187 --> 07:30.221
I hope not.

07:35.027 --> 07:36.494
<i>I knew she could beat
the polygraph,</i>

07:36.496 --> 07:38.262
<i>'cause I'm the one
who taught her how.</i>

07:38.264 --> 07:40.231
- I was looking for her tell.
- And you found one?

07:40.233 --> 07:42.533
She tucks her hair
behind her ear.

07:42.535 --> 07:44.235
You know, she did it
when she was lying.

07:44.237 --> 07:47.204
Ten minutes ago, she did it when
she was telling me the truth.

07:47.206 --> 07:49.707
I need something concrete.
There's nothing concrete.

07:49.709 --> 07:51.275
You're convincing yourself
that she's innocent

07:51.277 --> 07:52.443
because you care about her.

07:52.445 --> 07:54.612
Yeah, sure, I do.

07:54.614 --> 07:58.883
And all I have to go by is you
telling me that there's a rat.

07:58.885 --> 08:01.418
Do you have anything
more specific?

08:01.420 --> 08:05.656
Matt, we are about to move
a lot of illegal cash.

08:05.658 --> 08:08.058
You need to get this
buttoned up.

08:08.060 --> 08:09.627
I got to be sure.

08:09.629 --> 08:12.997
6 years as a Marine,
25 years on the force.

08:12.999 --> 08:16.200
Your gut is the reason
you're still alive.

08:16.202 --> 08:19.270
What does it say?

08:19.272 --> 08:21.605
That you can't
take back a bullet.

08:30.609 --> 08:33.311
Requisition form?

08:33.313 --> 08:36.447
I'm asking for a new gun.
Mine's jamming.

08:36.448 --> 08:38.582
- Jamming, huh?
- Yeah.

08:38.585 --> 08:41.719
Mind if I take a look?

08:41.721 --> 08:43.421
Feed lips are bent.

08:43.423 --> 08:44.789
Yeah.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.934
Seems okay.

08:55.936 --> 08:59.103
Yeah, I guess
I have to be more careful.

09:05.512 --> 09:08.680
I passed a car wash
on my way in.

09:08.682 --> 09:11.349
Neighborhood's raising money
to bury the man I killed.

09:11.751 --> 09:14.285
Keep your eyes
on the road, Loman.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.820
If you're only looking
in the rear view,

09:15.822 --> 09:18.055
it's an accident
waiting to happen.

09:21.094 --> 09:23.828
I found that in my trunk.

09:23.830 --> 09:25.029
It's his.

09:25.031 --> 09:26.797
I thought you said
he didn't have any ID.

09:26.799 --> 09:27.999
He didn't.
I checked him.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.533
Yeah, well,
you should check better.

09:30.035 --> 09:31.335
That's not some gangster,
Tess.

09:31.337 --> 09:33.504
That's an NYU kid.

09:33.506 --> 09:34.872
Whisper any louder,

09:34.874 --> 09:38.075
it's not going to be
a secret conversation.

09:38.077 --> 09:39.643
- You guys okay?
- Yes.

09:39.645 --> 09:42.045
No. We moved a body.

09:42.047 --> 09:43.514
I hate you.

09:43.516 --> 09:45.716
- Why would you do that?
- Look, I have my reasons.

09:45.718 --> 09:47.351
She's selling her house,

09:47.353 --> 09:49.653
hoping a fresh start
will save her marriage.

09:49.655 --> 09:51.488
A dead body
affects the bottom line.

09:51.490 --> 09:53.056
Only problem--
it's not some gangster

09:53.058 --> 09:54.224
no one's gonna investigate.

09:54.226 --> 09:57.861
It's an NYU student,
Amir Abbas.

09:57.863 --> 10:00.063
We need to tell Wozniak.

10:00.065 --> 10:04.635
No. Um,
he's got a lot going on.

10:04.637 --> 10:06.036
I'll help you handle it,
all right?

10:06.038 --> 10:08.005
Just give me a minute.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.142
<i>What'd you get
at breakfast?</i>

10:12.144 --> 10:13.343
A muffin.

10:13.345 --> 10:14.478
<i>That's funny.</i>

10:14.480 --> 10:16.480
Is that what you're gonna
tell Baker?

10:16.482 --> 10:17.848
<i>Look, he's not talking.</i>

10:17.850 --> 10:20.250
I tried, okay?

10:20.252 --> 10:21.585
You heard Baker.

10:21.587 --> 10:23.854
We need to give her something
by the end of the day,

10:23.856 --> 10:25.656
<i>or she will arrest you.</i>

10:25.658 --> 10:27.257
Hey, hey.
You think I don't know that?

10:27.259 --> 10:29.192
<i>I need this
as badly as you do.</i>

10:29.194 --> 10:31.094
Then what are you
getting me?

10:33.465 --> 10:35.899
Look, he has a black book.

10:35.901 --> 10:37.467
It reads like case notes,

10:37.469 --> 10:38.936
<i>but it's all names
and addresses,</i>

10:38.938 --> 10:40.737
<i>people he does business with.</i>

10:40.739 --> 10:43.707
He keeps it in a locked
file cabinet in his office.

10:43.709 --> 10:45.943
Great.
Get it.

10:45.945 --> 10:49.413
What? Now? Wozniak
could be back any minute.

10:49.415 --> 10:52.816
Then I suggest you hurry.

11:28.654 --> 11:31.488
I'm not doing this.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.089
Doing what?

11:35.394 --> 11:38.695
Um, just busy work.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.897
Nava, right?
You're here for the files?

11:40.899 --> 11:44.067
Yes and yes, Officer...

11:44.069 --> 11:45.969
Detective.

11:45.971 --> 11:47.971
Santos.

11:47.973 --> 11:49.239
Maybe we should
go through them,

11:49.241 --> 11:51.308
make sure they're all here.

11:51.310 --> 11:54.411
Records room is notorious.

11:54.413 --> 11:58.315
You think
that's a two-person job?

11:58.317 --> 12:00.183
I was just gonna supervise.

12:07.425 --> 12:09.158
A domestic violence call
at this place?

12:09.160 --> 12:10.226
Who'd believe it?

12:12.297 --> 12:14.331
I'm going to kill you!

12:15.233 --> 12:16.833
Dibs on the pimp.

12:16.835 --> 12:18.434
- All right. That's enough.
- Let me go!

12:18.436 --> 12:19.502
This is business!

12:19.504 --> 12:20.770
When they hit back,

12:20.772 --> 12:22.438
it's time to hang up
your pimp hat, old man.

12:22.440 --> 12:24.540
Easy, easy. Hey, hey.
He's gone. You okay?

12:24.542 --> 12:27.143
He goes out of his way
to put me with perverts.

12:27.145 --> 12:30.179
Yeah. I think you made it
clear that you're not into that.

12:31.749 --> 12:33.182
Where are you from?

12:33.184 --> 12:34.650
Diamond Escorts.

12:34.652 --> 12:36.919
No, I mean that language.

12:36.921 --> 12:39.088
Portuguese, right?

12:39.090 --> 12:41.290
We have better insults.

12:41.292 --> 12:43.359
Yeah.

12:47.165 --> 12:49.298
How are your compliments?

12:53.271 --> 12:56.605
<i>Your eyes are like the sky
or something.</i>

12:56.607 --> 13:00.409
<i>That sounds nice.</i>

13:00.411 --> 13:01.443
<i>What does that mean?</i>

13:03.814 --> 13:06.649
We were just, um,
finishing up.

13:08.286 --> 13:12.254
With your pants on?

13:15.126 --> 13:16.525
You leaving?

13:16.527 --> 13:18.527
Looked at every file twice.
Everything's here.

13:18.529 --> 13:20.829
I think your records room
has a bad rap.

13:20.831 --> 13:23.632
I'd pay them the compliment,
but I hate going down there.

13:23.634 --> 13:25.434
You afraid of the dark?

13:25.436 --> 13:27.503
Wouldn't you like to know?

13:27.505 --> 13:29.171
Come on; I'll walk you out.

13:32.276 --> 13:34.343
So one of those files there,

13:34.345 --> 13:38.514
um, I have some
personal history with.

13:38.516 --> 13:40.883
Maybe we can,
I don't know,

13:40.885 --> 13:43.585
go somewhere
and discuss it.

13:43.587 --> 13:47.489
Um, shirt pocket, my card.

13:50.061 --> 13:52.895
Text me a time and place.
I'll be there.

14:34.384 --> 14:38.487
- Did you get the book?
- No. Wozniak came back.

14:38.489 --> 14:39.655
<i>Harlee--</i>

14:41.259 --> 14:44.059
Har--

14:44.061 --> 14:45.294
Tess?

14:45.296 --> 14:47.863
Harlee, I'm such a moron.

14:47.865 --> 14:49.999
What kind of cop
moves a dead body?

14:53.571 --> 14:56.972
What's going on?

14:56.974 --> 14:59.408
Joe already had cold feet
about selling the place,

14:59.410 --> 15:01.510
but then when I saw that body
in that vacant lot

15:01.512 --> 15:05.014
next to my house,
I just-- I-I panicked.

15:05.016 --> 15:07.683
Look, I get that a corpse
kills an open house,

15:07.685 --> 15:10.719
but why the rush to sell?

15:12.924 --> 15:16.725
Joe's been sleeping
with some girl half my age.

15:16.727 --> 15:19.895
You know, selling the place
was about the money.

15:19.897 --> 15:21.730
But now it's about us.

15:21.732 --> 15:23.933
You know, like a do-over
or something.

15:26.237 --> 15:28.938
I hate him, Harlee,

15:28.940 --> 15:31.307
but I still love him.

15:31.309 --> 15:33.542
That's because
you have a good heart.

15:35.479 --> 15:36.879
Never apologize for that,

15:36.881 --> 15:39.348
not even when things
get complicated.

15:39.350 --> 15:41.550
You want complicated?

15:41.552 --> 15:44.019
The dead kid's dad is...

15:44.021 --> 15:48.057
on the board of that
mosque on Arrington.

15:48.059 --> 15:49.491
The one
that got fire-bombed.

15:49.493 --> 15:53.562
Yeah, this looks like
a hate crime.

15:53.564 --> 15:55.664
Yeah.
The FBI might be interested.

15:55.666 --> 15:57.366
I-I didn't even clean up
the vacant lot.

15:57.868 --> 16:01.303
I-- If somebody decides
to dig, I--

16:01.305 --> 16:03.271
Yeah. Okay.

16:03.273 --> 16:04.906
Pull a car.

16:04.908 --> 16:08.377
Meet me out front.

16:08.379 --> 16:11.179
We both need that book,
Harlee.

16:11.181 --> 16:12.948
Look, I have a lead
on the murder

16:12.950 --> 16:14.916
of an influential Arab's son.

16:14.918 --> 16:17.686
Possible hate crime.

16:17.688 --> 16:18.987
I can get you the killer.

16:18.989 --> 16:21.556
<i>I don't work Homicide,
Harlee.</i>

16:22.058 --> 16:24.192
Look, I'm out of options,
okay?

16:24.194 --> 16:26.661
This is what I have.
We need something.

16:26.663 --> 16:28.730
<i>All right,
but you'd better deliver.</i>

16:36.072 --> 16:38.339
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:38.341 --> 16:39.807
How'd it go with the ADA?

16:39.809 --> 16:41.409
Good.

16:41.411 --> 16:44.345
I'll make sure he's invested.

16:44.347 --> 16:45.546
Where you off to?

16:45.548 --> 16:47.348
Tess's for lunch.

16:47.350 --> 16:48.650
Need anything?

16:48.652 --> 16:51.352
No.

16:51.354 --> 16:56.090
Oh, um, a couple of files
were missing from Nava's box.

16:56.092 --> 16:58.660
I pulled your personal copies
and xeroxed them,

16:58.662 --> 17:01.229
forgot to return the key
with the files.

17:01.231 --> 17:04.365
What files?

17:04.367 --> 17:06.800
Girard and Dibble.

17:06.803 --> 17:08.569
But I'm meeting up
with Nava later.

17:08.570 --> 17:11.071
I'll hand them over.

17:56.585 --> 17:58.952
I'm sorry.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.788

Hi. We're just taking
donations,

18:10.599 --> 18:13.200
so whatever you want
to give.

18:16.572 --> 18:18.972
That's very generous.
Thank you.

18:18.974 --> 18:21.308
Please don't thank me.

18:31.220 --> 18:33.587
- Lieutenant.
- Sorry to interrupt.

18:33.589 --> 18:36.190
Uh, Harlee said
you were missing these files.

18:36.192 --> 18:38.492
Girard and Dibble.

18:39.862 --> 18:41.094
No.

18:41.496 --> 18:43.129
Girard and Dibble.
Got 'em right here.

18:43.131 --> 18:45.232
You come all the way
down here just for that?

18:48.837 --> 18:51.771
No. I was here
for a deposition. Thanks.

19:15.430 --> 19:17.163
That's Wozniak.

19:17.165 --> 19:19.266
Shouldn't we call Santos?

19:19.268 --> 19:21.568
She's looking into a murder,
not betraying him.

19:21.570 --> 19:24.104
Let it ride.

19:24.106 --> 19:26.506
There's no blood.

19:26.508 --> 19:27.774
Did you see anybody running?

19:27.776 --> 19:30.243
No. It took me a minute
to get to the window.

19:30.245 --> 19:32.245
Oh, here. Here.

19:32.247 --> 19:34.314
I found the casing.

19:37.586 --> 19:39.452
Didn't you say
no exit wound?

19:39.454 --> 19:40.854
I didn't strip him naked.

19:40.856 --> 19:43.056
He only had blood coming
out of one side of his T-shirt.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.457
That would mean
the shooter was at a distance.

19:44.459 --> 19:46.326
The casing is right here
where he fell.

19:53.802 --> 19:55.068
Nobody shot him.

19:55.070 --> 19:58.305
Look at the dent.
He was using it as a target.

19:58.307 --> 20:00.940
He fired the gun.

20:00.942 --> 20:03.076
Casing dropped here.

20:03.078 --> 20:05.412
And the bullet
ricocheted right back into him.

20:05.414 --> 20:09.149
Swell theory,
except where's the gun?

20:09.151 --> 20:11.217
He could have
thrown it on impact.

20:35.187 --> 20:37.021
He's leaving.
You think we should follow?

20:37.023 --> 20:39.090
Mm.
She passed his polygraph.

20:41.895 --> 20:45.830
He's probably just looking
into Tess Nazario.

20:45.832 --> 20:47.899
You think he made us?

20:50.370 --> 20:53.538
What are we doing? The gun
is too heavy to throw this far.

20:56.309 --> 20:58.042
Not if it's plastic.

20:58.044 --> 21:00.845
That's a toy.

21:00.847 --> 21:04.582
Then why does it have
powder burns?

21:04.584 --> 21:05.850
Put the pimp in the cage.

21:10.657 --> 21:12.857
If somebody gave me time
with a piece of ass,

21:12.859 --> 21:15.293
I wouldn't be reciting
no poetry.

21:15.295 --> 21:16.561
It wasn't poetry.

21:16.563 --> 21:17.996
It was a compliment.

21:17.998 --> 21:19.998
That's nice.
It really is.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.333
The thing is, you ain't got
to sweet-talk a whore.

21:22.335 --> 21:23.368
It wasn't for her.

21:23.370 --> 21:24.469
Yeah? Who's it for?

21:24.471 --> 21:26.604
There's a woman I'm into.

21:26.606 --> 21:28.339
Brazilian.

21:28.341 --> 21:29.607
My man. Hitting it.

21:29.609 --> 21:30.875
The details, player..

21:30.877 --> 21:33.411
Not-- no.
I'm not hitting it.

21:33.413 --> 21:35.480
I met her on a dating site.

21:35.482 --> 21:37.682
We've been e-mailing, but she
doesn't speak much English.

21:37.684 --> 21:39.651
So when I realized
the escort was Brazilian,

21:39.653 --> 21:42.887
I asked her to teach me
how to say a few things.

21:42.889 --> 21:45.690
You asked a whore
how to woo?

21:45.692 --> 21:47.492
Who says "Woo"?
What are you, Amish?

21:47.494 --> 21:49.227
You know, you sit
across from His Royal Highness

21:49.229 --> 21:51.629
King Panty-Dropper
all damn day,

21:51.631 --> 21:53.097
and you ask a whore
for lady advice.

21:53.099 --> 21:54.632
I knew this was a mistake.

21:54.634 --> 21:57.669
You know,
I'm gonna go get a cookie,

21:57.671 --> 21:59.170
process this betrayal.

21:59.172 --> 22:01.506
- Okay.
- Yeah.

22:04.144 --> 22:05.543
Get anything?

22:05.545 --> 22:07.979
The dead kid,
he studied humanities.

22:07.981 --> 22:11.182
He took a computer survey class
last semester.

22:11.184 --> 22:13.584
I doubt he's building 3-D guns
in his spare time.

22:13.586 --> 22:14.986
Good. Case closed.

22:14.988 --> 22:16.454
No, no, no.
Not necessarily.

22:16.456 --> 22:18.990
His roommate is
an innovative technology major.

22:18.992 --> 22:21.459
It could be him.
I got the address.

22:21.461 --> 22:22.694
Off-campus housing.

22:22.696 --> 22:25.263
We should run over
and check it out.

22:25.265 --> 22:26.597
No.

22:26.599 --> 22:28.399
We let it go.

22:28.401 --> 22:31.202
Look, I don't want
untraceable plastic guns

22:31.204 --> 22:32.937
out there
any more than you do.

22:32.939 --> 22:34.272
If we make an arrest,

22:34.274 --> 22:37.842
we got to tell 'em
where we got our lead.

22:37.844 --> 22:40.678
Either of you know
how to do that?

22:48.054 --> 22:49.687
They followed me.

22:49.689 --> 22:52.023
The feds.

22:52.025 --> 22:53.624
And you thought coming here
was a good idea?

22:53.626 --> 22:55.693
I lost them, Donnie.

22:57.964 --> 22:59.297
Well, if they had
anything substantial,

22:59.299 --> 23:00.932
you'd be in custody.

23:02.235 --> 23:04.035
Harlee's the mole.

23:04.037 --> 23:05.703
She went through
my filing cabinet.

23:05.705 --> 23:07.438
Then she lied about it.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.507
It's Harlee.

23:13.880 --> 23:16.380
She made her choice,
Matt.

23:16.382 --> 23:18.483
Now you need to make yours.

23:23.056 --> 23:26.290
Protect your family,
Lieutenant.

23:26.292 --> 23:27.291
Tonight.

23:49.716 --> 23:50.915
Couldn't let it go
either, huh?

23:50.917 --> 23:53.151
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm not the bad guy.

23:53.153 --> 23:56.053
Good reflexes, though.
Want me to clear the back?

23:56.055 --> 23:58.122
No, I got it.

24:35.461 --> 24:37.829
Other room's clean.
You find anything?

24:37.831 --> 24:39.597
Yeah, the reason
why this kid was shooting guns

24:39.599 --> 24:41.632
next to Tess's house.

24:41.634 --> 24:43.801
That's her house
in the background.

24:43.803 --> 24:45.503
Kid's her neighbor.

24:45.505 --> 24:46.871
I'll clean up.

24:46.873 --> 24:48.206
You go tell Tess.

24:48.208 --> 24:49.707
Yeah.
That's gonna be fun.

25:02.488 --> 25:04.555
<i>Amir, you home?</i>

25:12.332 --> 25:16.033
NYPD.
Don't move.

25:30.116 --> 25:31.616
I don't have anything.

25:31.618 --> 25:34.652
You have the right
to shut the hell up.

25:38.524 --> 25:39.891
Hey.

25:39.893 --> 25:42.460
If you came for dinner,
you're gonna be disappointed.

25:44.797 --> 25:50.001
Tess, I, um--
I looked into the dead kid.

25:50.003 --> 25:53.337
Why? We agreed not to.

25:53.339 --> 25:55.806
He's your neighbor.

25:55.808 --> 25:58.276
His parents live in the house
on the corner.

26:02.115 --> 26:05.516
Oh, man.

26:21.935 --> 26:22.934
Hey.

26:22.936 --> 26:25.636
Meet me at the marina
in two hours.

26:25.638 --> 26:27.805
I got a hunch.

26:39.465 --> 26:41.233
Next Saturday,
it's you and me.

26:41.235 --> 26:42.801
It's your job
to think of something fun to do.

26:42.803 --> 26:45.237
Go to the gun range?

26:45.239 --> 26:48.674
I'm thinking maybe
the space museum.

26:48.676 --> 26:50.676
Guns don't work in space.

26:54.781 --> 26:58.483
You drag him to another hearing,
I will sue you for full custody.

26:58.485 --> 27:00.418
In all your spare time?

27:00.420 --> 27:03.421
You want to hurt me?
Do it yourself.

27:05.792 --> 27:06.992
See you, buddy.

27:06.994 --> 27:08.560
Stahl.

27:08.562 --> 27:11.596
<i>Where's my evidence
that Harlee is cooperating?</i>

27:11.598 --> 27:13.098
I have three hours.

27:13.100 --> 27:16.201
Yeah, and I've been trying
to reach you for the past two.

27:16.203 --> 27:17.902
I was in court.

27:17.904 --> 27:20.038
- What case?
<i>- It's a custody hearing.</i>

27:20.040 --> 27:22.140
I'm on my way
to see Harlee right now.

27:22.142 --> 27:25.110
You know, Robert,
when you were transferred,

27:25.112 --> 27:28.613
I was warned that you may be
under undue stress.

27:28.615 --> 27:31.116
Doesn't help when your boss
gives you an arbitrary clock

27:31.118 --> 27:33.351
on a case I've been building
for the last two months.

27:33.353 --> 27:36.521
Any agent who loses a partner
in the line of duty is--

27:36.523 --> 27:37.722
I'm on a tight deadline here.

27:37.724 --> 27:39.791
- Can I help you with something?
<i>- Yes.</i>

27:39.793 --> 27:41.926
I thought you should know
that Wozniak has arranged

27:41.928 --> 27:44.729
to meet Harlee outside
the normal location pattern.

27:44.731 --> 27:47.766
Agent Stahl,
I gave you a little rope

27:47.768 --> 27:49.668
when no one else would.

27:49.670 --> 27:51.603
Don't hang yourself with it.

27:55.342 --> 27:56.941
Ma'am,
he's waiting for you.

27:56.943 --> 27:58.009
Thank you.

28:05.585 --> 28:06.818
- Hi.
- Hey.

28:06.820 --> 28:08.853
Wow.
I-- that's a dress.

28:10.424 --> 28:12.757
- You look great.
- Thank you.

28:12.759 --> 28:14.559
I ordered something
in French.

28:14.561 --> 28:16.094
Sounded like detergent.

28:16.096 --> 28:17.762
That's what I get for being late.

28:17.764 --> 28:19.597
Yeah.

28:21.768 --> 28:24.169
I thought you wanted
to talk about a case.

28:24.171 --> 28:25.637
I do.

28:25.639 --> 28:26.971
Feels a little
like a date.

28:26.973 --> 28:29.741
- The waiter said, "Good evening."
- Really?

28:29.743 --> 28:32.110
I-I-I couldn't hear that
over the violin.

28:32.112 --> 28:34.379
There's a candle
on the table.

28:34.381 --> 28:37.315
Damn, you're right.

28:37.317 --> 28:39.417
Maybe this <i> is</i> a date.

28:39.419 --> 28:40.719
What do we do now?

28:40.721 --> 28:43.188
Well, in the spirit
of good first dates,

28:43.190 --> 28:44.989
things should probably get
a little awkward.

28:47.728 --> 28:49.127
Six months to live?

28:49.129 --> 28:50.929
I'd be in Bali.

28:50.931 --> 28:52.330
Now, that would be
a good first date.

28:52.332 --> 28:54.866
Or a honeymoon.

28:54.868 --> 28:56.968
What? A-are we
getting married already?

28:56.970 --> 28:59.637
No. Actually, uh...

28:59.639 --> 29:02.741
it's where my honeymoon
was supposed to be.

29:02.743 --> 29:04.376
Are you engaged?

29:04.378 --> 29:06.411
Used to be.

29:06.413 --> 29:08.246
It's recent.

29:08.248 --> 29:10.448
You still love her recent?

29:10.450 --> 29:13.084
She'd be upset
if I was on a date recent.

29:13.086 --> 29:15.420
Ah, I get the feeling
it's in flux.

29:15.422 --> 29:17.555
No. It's over.

29:17.557 --> 29:20.759
Just not finished.

29:20.761 --> 29:22.694
When it comes to awkward,
I crush.

29:22.696 --> 29:24.963
- No, I can do better.
- Hmm?

29:24.965 --> 29:28.366
Uh, you know that case
I told you I had insight on?

29:28.368 --> 29:30.101
Mm-hmm.

29:30.103 --> 29:34.005
It was with a guy
I dated, Miguel Zepeda.

29:34.007 --> 29:35.974
I'm not familiar.
What'd he do?

29:35.976 --> 29:39.043
Um...

29:42.182 --> 29:44.282
I, um...

29:44.284 --> 29:46.651
you know, maybe you
should just read the file.

29:46.653 --> 29:49.654
I thought
you wanted to discuss it.

29:55.328 --> 29:58.463
Um, I'm sorry.

29:58.465 --> 29:59.631
I'll be right back.

30:05.138 --> 30:06.404
So who killed
the Muslim kid?

30:06.406 --> 30:08.506
Are you trying
to blow my cover?

30:08.508 --> 30:12.210
Turns out
I got a schedule to keep.

30:12.212 --> 30:13.812
He killed himself.

30:13.814 --> 30:16.681
Accident.

30:16.683 --> 30:18.783
That doesn't help us.

30:22.355 --> 30:24.155
This does.

30:24.157 --> 30:26.090
That opens a locker
at the student union.

30:26.092 --> 30:28.359
In it is a duffel bag
filled with 3-D guns

30:28.361 --> 30:30.495
and the software used
to print them.

30:30.497 --> 30:32.597
It's how the kid got dead.

30:34.634 --> 30:37.168
- Who designed them?
- His roommate.

30:37.170 --> 30:39.804
Presently handcuffed
to his bed.

30:39.806 --> 30:42.407
The address
is in the duffel.

30:42.409 --> 30:47.445
So nothing from Wozniak,
then?

30:47.447 --> 30:49.614
No.

30:49.616 --> 30:52.183
So you're not meeting him
after this?

30:52.185 --> 30:56.521
I have your phone cloned,
Harlee.

30:56.523 --> 30:58.056
Stop trying to play me.

30:58.058 --> 31:01.025
What's the marina?

31:01.027 --> 31:03.695
It's a pier
overlooking La Guardia.

31:03.697 --> 31:05.697
Woz keeps his boat there.

31:05.699 --> 31:07.732
Hmm. Can't wait to see it.

31:07.734 --> 31:09.400
Look, it's private property.

31:09.402 --> 31:10.435
One parking lot.

31:10.437 --> 31:11.936
No traffic at night.

31:11.938 --> 31:14.038
He will spot you.

31:17.744 --> 31:20.144
Take your dress off.

31:20.146 --> 31:21.846
Oh, you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

31:21.848 --> 31:25.683
I'm wiring you
for the meet.

31:25.685 --> 31:27.952
You--
you're gonna strap me?

31:27.954 --> 31:31.022
Are you crazy?

31:31.024 --> 31:32.357
Just give me
another necklace.

31:32.359 --> 31:33.558
If you think it's gonna
be a problem for me

31:33.560 --> 31:34.826
to get close enough
to hear a conversation,

31:34.828 --> 31:36.561
we're gonna need something
that records too.

31:36.563 --> 31:38.429
So when I say,
"Take your dress off"...

31:40.233 --> 31:42.267
You take your dress off.

31:53.780 --> 31:55.880
No.

31:55.882 --> 31:58.950
You don't touch me, ever.

32:02.622 --> 32:05.390
Listen, I will touch you

32:05.392 --> 32:10.695
whenever and however
I deem necessary,

32:10.697 --> 32:14.399
because I own you.

32:14.401 --> 32:15.833
You understand?

32:17.837 --> 32:21.172
Do you understand me?

32:26.813 --> 32:28.947
Where's the fire?

32:28.949 --> 32:31.482
I had cut my date
with the ADA short.

32:31.484 --> 32:33.384
You have a tell.

32:33.386 --> 32:34.752
What?

32:34.754 --> 32:36.588
You have a tell
when you're lying,

32:36.590 --> 32:38.222
and you lied to me,
Harlee.

32:38.224 --> 32:39.424
You lied to me!

32:39.426 --> 32:40.558
Really?

32:40.560 --> 32:43.595
A polygraph wasn't enough?

32:43.597 --> 32:44.796
I don't need
to listen to this.

32:44.798 --> 32:46.364
You're gonna tell me
the whole truth,

32:46.366 --> 32:49.901
or I swear to God
I'll shoot you right here.

32:57.210 --> 33:00.778
Okay.

33:00.780 --> 33:03.047
What's my tell?

33:03.049 --> 33:05.583
What is this thing
that I do that has you so sure

33:05.585 --> 33:08.620
that I'm a fed mole
that you would kill me?

33:11.091 --> 33:15.326
You push your hair
behind your ear.

33:15.328 --> 33:18.863
I pulled video footage
of our first interview,

33:18.865 --> 33:21.232
the one where you
were lying about Miguel.

33:21.234 --> 33:26.537
You did it then,
and you did it last night.

33:26.539 --> 33:30.008
- This is a joke, right?
- Is it?

33:30.010 --> 33:32.176
Because I did it
five minutes ago

33:32.178 --> 33:35.146
and five minutes
before that.

33:35.148 --> 33:38.483
I've been pushing my hair behind
my ear since kindergarten.

33:38.485 --> 33:40.585
I also lick my lips,
bite my nails...

33:40.587 --> 33:41.853
- Don't!
- Tug at my--

33:41.855 --> 33:43.955
Don't!
Don't twist this around. Don't.

33:43.957 --> 33:45.757
There's nothing to twist.

33:45.759 --> 33:49.160
All right, what the--
what the hell is wrong with you?

33:49.162 --> 33:51.429
You know me.

33:51.431 --> 33:56.901
I also know the ADA
wasn't missing any files,

33:56.903 --> 33:58.236
'cause I dropped them off.

33:58.238 --> 33:59.504
You lied to me.

33:59.506 --> 34:01.606
You lied to me again.

34:04.878 --> 34:06.678
I lied about that.
Okay.

34:06.680 --> 34:08.880
You know why?

34:08.882 --> 34:10.681
Because I was looking
for Loman's psych eval.

34:10.684 --> 34:12.583
- Lies. It's just more lies.
- No.

34:12.585 --> 34:15.253
- You're a liar.
- Loman bashed his clip.

34:15.255 --> 34:17.321
And he was trying
to turn his gun in.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.524
The shooting's messing
with his head, Woz.

34:19.525 --> 34:23.828
I didn't want to come to you
until I knew how bad it was.

34:23.830 --> 34:25.996
You don't believe me?
Call him.

34:25.998 --> 34:27.297
Do it.

34:30.737 --> 34:33.804
Or maybe you want something
more concrete.

34:35.942 --> 34:37.975
You gave me enough lead time
for this meeting,

34:37.976 --> 34:41.579
made sure I came alone.

34:41.581 --> 34:44.649
If I'm the mole,
I must have a wire.

34:46.786 --> 34:48.853
Here.
Check my purse.

34:57.063 --> 34:58.763
There's a gun.

34:58.765 --> 35:02.900
Notice I didn't reach for it.

35:02.902 --> 35:06.003
No necklace.
No earrings.

35:06.005 --> 35:08.873
Must be strapped somewhere.

35:08.875 --> 35:09.907
What are you doing?

35:09.909 --> 35:11.442
Body's the best place,
right?

35:11.444 --> 35:13.211
Stop.

35:13.213 --> 35:15.279
Harlee, st--

35:18.718 --> 35:20.785
No. Look at me.

35:22.989 --> 35:24.756
Look at me!

35:31.531 --> 35:35.333
It kills me that somebody's
trying to hurt you.

35:35.335 --> 35:38.736
I'm so sorry
this is happening.

35:38.738 --> 35:40.805
You know I'd do
anything for you.

35:48.148 --> 35:50.148
Get dressed.

36:02.409 --> 36:04.510
Hey, you sure
you don't want another slice?

36:04.512 --> 36:05.878
- Thank you.
- Hey, you earned it.

36:05.880 --> 36:07.146
'Cause you worked hard.

36:07.148 --> 36:08.547
Mm-hmm.

36:08.549 --> 36:10.015
Here.

36:10.017 --> 36:11.584
You can have one.

36:14.622 --> 36:16.088
Didn't even know
your cousin.

36:16.090 --> 36:17.790
You would have liked him.

36:17.792 --> 36:20.426
The funeral is tomorrow.
You could come.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.595
Okay. That's enough.
Let's go ahead and get you home.

36:22.597 --> 36:25.364
- Okay.
- Wait for me by the door.

36:27.602 --> 36:29.101
Thank you.

36:29.103 --> 36:31.170
Yeah.

36:31.172 --> 36:33.505
Hey, uh...

36:33.507 --> 36:36.241
can I see you again?

36:36.243 --> 36:38.711
You donated a lot of money.

36:38.713 --> 36:40.746
Why?

36:43.317 --> 36:45.317
I'm familiar with tragedy.

36:56.464 --> 36:59.131
He's right, you know.

36:59.133 --> 37:00.599
You would have liked him.

Your parents
will be here soon.

38:55.349 --> 38:57.449
I'm so sorry.

39:26.213 --> 39:28.547
You know where I live?

39:28.549 --> 39:32.251
I'm a detective.

39:32.253 --> 39:34.386
You said you thought
your ex-fiancée

39:34.388 --> 39:35.954
might be upset
if she saw you out with me,

39:35.956 --> 39:38.824
so I thought
maybe we could stay in.

39:38.826 --> 39:40.692
You made me dinner?

39:40.694 --> 39:41.827
Well, my daughter did.

39:41.829 --> 39:44.897
But I'm happy to take credit.

39:48.369 --> 39:50.769
Look, um, as much
as I'd like to finish our meal,

39:50.771 --> 39:52.171
I'm a little worried
letting you in

39:52.173 --> 39:54.473
might cross that line
between professional

39:54.475 --> 39:58.177
and, you know...

39:58.179 --> 40:00.813
Mm.

40:00.815 --> 40:05.184
Where do you think
that line might be, exactly?

40:05.186 --> 40:07.252
Here?

40:10.424 --> 40:13.358
Here?

40:13.360 --> 40:16.829
Yeah, probably about there.
Yeah.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.897
Oops.

40:26.340 --> 40:29.041
Make yourself at home.

40:29.043 --> 40:31.944
I'm kind of a minimalist.

40:31.946 --> 40:33.645
Fiancée took
all the furniture, huh?

40:33.647 --> 40:35.013
Yeah.

40:35.015 --> 40:38.650
Well, to be fair,
most of it was hers.

40:38.652 --> 40:41.620
Well, nice of her
to leave you the stove.

40:41.622 --> 40:44.957
She also forgot to take my
classic cowboy movie collection.

40:44.959 --> 40:47.159
- She must have been in a hurry.
- Yeah.

40:47.161 --> 40:49.261
I love old movies.

40:49.263 --> 40:52.030
Something about
black and white.

40:52.032 --> 40:54.299
Feels like life
was simpler somehow.

40:54.301 --> 40:55.767
Yeah?

40:55.769 --> 40:57.970
I'd say we could
watch one, but...

40:57.972 --> 40:59.838
She took the TV?

41:01.642 --> 41:03.642
Guess we'll have to think
of something else to do.

41:03.644 --> 41:06.745
- Feel like playing Scrabble?
- You could kiss me.

41:08.048 --> 41:10.148
Yeah.
Your idea is way better.
