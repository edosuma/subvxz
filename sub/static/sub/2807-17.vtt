00:06.172 --> 00:07.965
Joey? Are you in there?

00:08.132 --> 00:10.968
- Oh, my God, that's Rachel.
- Joey, you have to talk to her.

00:11.136 --> 00:14.888
No, I can't. Not after the other night.
It's just... It's too weird, okay?

00:15.056 --> 00:17.099
Don't tell her I'm here.

00:18.727 --> 00:20.644
Don't eat that.

00:22.063 --> 00:23.105
- Hey.
- Rach.

00:23.273 --> 00:24.982
- Hey, Rachel.
- Is Joey here?

00:25.150 --> 00:27.276
- I don't see him. You see him?
- I don't see him.

00:27.444 --> 00:30.946
Maybe he's in the sugar bowl.
Joey? Nope.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.615
Well, at least you make
each other laugh.

00:35.326 --> 00:37.619
- What's up?
- Well, I haven't seen him since that night...

00:37.787 --> 00:40.748
...that he told me how he, you know...

00:40.915 --> 00:43.584
I don't know,
I think he's avoiding me.

00:43.752 --> 00:44.960
Why is that bagel on the floor?

00:47.756 --> 00:50.758
- We were playing a game.
- Ew, was Chandler naked?

00:52.886 --> 00:56.221
Sort of like a ring-toss
kind of situation?

00:56.806 --> 01:00.017
- Sure.
- What? No. No.

01:00.560 --> 01:05.689
All right, well, listen. If you see Joey,
will you just tell him that, uh?

01:05.857 --> 01:07.691
Tell him I miss him.

01:12.697 --> 01:17.076
- Okay. Did you hear that?
- Yeah. That naked bagel game? Heh.

01:19.662 --> 01:21.997
Dude, I don't know.
That's a pretty small hole.

01:24.959 --> 01:27.544
- Honey, you've gotta talk to her.
- I can't.

01:27.712 --> 01:30.547
You guys don't know what it's like
to put yourself out there like that...

01:30.715 --> 01:31.965
...and then just get shot down.

01:32.133 --> 01:34.426
I don't know what that's like?

01:34.594 --> 01:38.764
Up until I was 25, I thought the only
response to "I love you" was "Oh, crap."

01:39.682 --> 01:41.016
Hello. No rejection?

01:41.184 --> 01:44.103
I got shot down at fat camp.

01:45.522 --> 01:47.815
Boy, kids are mean when they're hungry.

01:50.318 --> 01:52.152
All right, so, what do I do?

01:52.362 --> 01:55.572
This is Rachel. What are you gonna do,
never talk to her again?

01:55.740 --> 01:58.784
I know it's weird and it's awkward,
but you gotta at least try.

02:00.078 --> 02:02.871
Yeah, okay.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.791
Whoa. I almost forgot this was on your...

02:05.959 --> 02:08.335
We didn't play it.

02:49.085 --> 02:52.504
Okay, so when you're done with your tea,
I'll look at the leaves and tell your fortune.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.757
- I didn't know you read tea leaves.
- Oh, yeah, I've done it for years.

02:55.925 --> 02:58.260
I actually stopped
because I was so accurate.

02:58.428 --> 03:01.805
You know, and one of the great joys
of life...

03:01.973 --> 03:05.100
...is its wondrous unpredictability,
you know?

03:05.268 --> 03:08.228
And also,
tea tends to give me the trots.

03:08.771 --> 03:11.982
- Okay. I'm done. Read mine.
- Okay.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.444
Ooh. I see a ladder.

03:15.612 --> 03:19.489
Which can mean either a promotion
or a violent death.

03:23.286 --> 03:26.205
I'm the head chef.
I can't get promoted.

03:26.497 --> 03:28.916
Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Who's next?

03:30.126 --> 03:31.752
Okay, I'm done. Do mine.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.420
Okay.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.965
- Um... Oh. Okay, I see a circle.
- Oh.

03:37.258 --> 03:40.886
Oh, which can either mean
you're having a baby...

03:41.054 --> 03:43.847
...or you're gonna make
a scientific discovery.

03:44.015 --> 03:47.726
Well, I have been spending
a lot of time in the lab.

03:49.020 --> 03:53.023
- What does yours say, Pheebs?
- Um... Wow, all right.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.609
Wow. Yay.

03:55.777 --> 03:59.988
Oh, I'm gonna meet a guy.
And really soon.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.532
And he's gonna be
the man of my dreams.

04:02.700 --> 04:05.202
Probably not the guy
I had a dream about last night.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.912
You.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.584
Hey, has anyone seen my shirt?

04:12.752 --> 04:16.421
It's a button-down,
like a faded salmon color?

04:16.589 --> 04:18.882
You mean your pink shirt?

04:19.801 --> 04:21.760
Faded salmon color?

04:21.928 --> 04:24.471
No, I haven't seen your pink shirt.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.308
Great, great. Then I must have
left it at Mona's. I knew it.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.727
I'm sure you can get another one
at Ann Taylor's.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.149
That's my favorite shirt, okay?
I love that shirt.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.318
Well, just ask Mona to give it back.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.320
I don't know. I mean, I guess I could.

04:40.488 --> 04:44.074
It's just, we didn't really end things
on such good terms.

04:44.242 --> 04:47.244
And if I went over there, I'd be ignoring
the one thing she asked me to do...

04:47.412 --> 04:51.331
...when we broke up:
Jump up my own ass and die.

04:54.961 --> 04:57.546
Oh, wait a second, you guys.

04:57.880 --> 05:00.882
For the last couple weeks, I've been
seeing that guy everywhere I go.

05:01.050 --> 05:04.553
We take the same bus, we go to
the same bookstore, same dry cleaner.

05:04.721 --> 05:06.430
Maybe he's the tea guy.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.184
Pheebs, did you see that?

05:11.352 --> 05:13.562
He totally checked you out
and he is so cute.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.361
Mine is a picture of the Village People.
What does that mean?

05:26.784 --> 05:28.994
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:42.091 --> 05:44.718
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.353
Tea gives Phoebe the trots.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.905
I thought Joey and I would be okay
once we hung out...

06:05.073 --> 06:07.824
...but it's like we don't even know
how to be with each other anymore.

06:08.034 --> 06:11.745
- I know it's tough, but things will get better.
- How do you know that?

06:11.913 --> 06:14.373
What if it just gets
worse and worse and worse...

06:14.540 --> 06:17.918
...to the point where we can't even
be in the same room with each other?

06:18.503 --> 06:20.754
I'm not great at the advice.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.215
Can I interest you
in a sarcastic comment?

06:25.385 --> 06:27.094
Some cheese?

06:30.473 --> 06:34.768
Honey, why is the Bruce Springsteen CD
in the Cat Stevens case?

06:34.936 --> 06:38.855
Let's just say if I can't find the right
CD case, I just put it in the nearest one.

06:39.190 --> 06:42.776
- Okay, well, where is the Cat Stevens CD?
- In the James Taylor case.

06:42.944 --> 06:45.695
- Where's the James Taylor CD?
- Honey, I'm gonna save you some time.

06:45.863 --> 06:48.740
Two hundred CDs,
not one of them in the right case.

06:50.410 --> 06:54.955
Okay. No need to panic.
Deep breaths, everyone.

06:55.123 --> 06:57.165
Okay, um, we're just gonna have to
spend some time...

06:57.333 --> 06:58.834
...and put the CDs in the right cases.

06:59.001 --> 07:01.420
If we're gonna do that,
we should come up with some order.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.213
Like alphabetically, or by genre.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.924
Hmm, I don't know.
We really have to talk this through.

07:06.092 --> 07:11.012
Oh, my God, you guys have such problems.
I feel so terrible for you.

07:12.557 --> 07:14.975
All right. Okay, I'm sorry.

07:15.143 --> 07:18.478
Look, you and Joey, you're both focusing
on this uncomfortable thing.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.605
What you need to do
is change the subject.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.900
Next time you see him, try to get him
talking about something else.

07:24.068 --> 07:25.694
- Oh, yeah, that makes sense.
- Yeah.

07:25.862 --> 07:29.156
I don't know, maybe you have
a work problem you need his advice on.

07:29.323 --> 07:31.241
- Ooh, I could do that. I could do that.
- Good.

07:32.326 --> 07:34.744
Honey, the Miami Vice soundtrack?
Really?

07:34.954 --> 07:36.997
They were just giving those away
at the store.

07:38.499 --> 07:41.460
In exchange for money.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.505
Hey.

07:45.923 --> 07:47.048
Hi.

07:50.261 --> 07:52.804
I really don't know what to tell you, Rach.
I really don't.

07:52.972 --> 07:57.601
Maybe Joey could help you out
with your big work problem.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.104
- What?
- Yeah, Joey, she's...

08:01.272 --> 08:05.066
Rachel's got this really big work problem.
It is a head-scratcher. Heh.

08:06.277 --> 08:10.655
Well, you know what? If we're gonna make
dinner, we're gonna have to leave. Yeah.

08:14.952 --> 08:18.288
So you, uh, have a big work problem?

08:19.290 --> 08:21.625
Yeah. It's, um...

08:21.792 --> 08:24.044
Yeah, it's, uh...

08:26.714 --> 08:29.007
You know, it's nothing.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.510
Oh. Okay.

08:35.097 --> 08:37.349
So, uh, I think I'm gonna take off.

08:38.017 --> 08:42.604
No, wait, Joey, it is.
It's something. It's, um...

08:42.772 --> 08:44.356
It's my boss.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.609
- Yeah?
- Yeah. And, um...

08:49.195 --> 08:51.196
And my baby.

08:51.864 --> 08:52.948
Yeah?

08:54.242 --> 08:56.326
My boss wants to buy my baby.

08:58.829 --> 09:02.249
What? Oh, my... Oh, my God.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.669
I know, I told you,
it's a really big problem.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.631
- He wants to buy your baby?
- Can you believe that?

09:09.799 --> 09:12.551
- That's crazy.
- That's what I told him.

09:12.718 --> 09:16.429
- How did this even happen?
- Well, I'll tell you.

09:19.392 --> 09:24.813
See, uh, my boss and, uh, his wife,
they can't have children, so, um...

09:24.981 --> 09:28.066
And then when we were
at the Christmas party...

09:28.234 --> 09:32.862
...and he got drunk and said to me,
"Rachel, I want to buy your baby."

09:33.281 --> 09:38.368
Man. When you said it was a problem
about your boss and the baby...

09:38.536 --> 09:40.537
...I figured it was something
about maternity leave.

09:40.705 --> 09:43.832
Oh. Yeah.

09:53.634 --> 09:57.762
Yeah, that would have been
a much simpler problem.

10:04.103 --> 10:08.356
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, it's you. I see you everywhere.

10:08.524 --> 10:10.567
- Mm-hm.
- I'm Jim. Jim Nelson.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.236
Jim-Jim Nelson.
I'm Phoebe-Phoebe Buffay.

10:14.822 --> 10:16.781
We certainly have been seeing
a lot of each other.

10:16.949 --> 10:21.369
We have. Maybe we'll see each other
at dinner tomorrow. Say, around 8:00?

10:22.830 --> 10:24.914
Well, maybe we will.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.626
Oh.

10:33.674 --> 10:35.175
Mona?

10:46.520 --> 10:47.729
Ow.

10:59.325 --> 11:02.786
Okay, if I were a salmon shirt,
where would I be?

11:10.086 --> 11:13.505
I am so sorry I spilled wine
all over your shirt.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.633
- Oh, it's okay.
- No, it's still wet.

11:16.801 --> 11:20.845
Let me get it out before it sets.
Oh, I have something you could wear.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.393
- Here.
- Oh, uh...

11:26.977 --> 11:28.853
I don't know if I wanna wear
a woman's shirt.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.983
- No, no, that's a man's shirt.
- Awfully pink.

11:34.151 --> 11:36.027
It's not pink.

11:39.448 --> 11:42.075
Oh, my God, honey,
we are so meant to be together.

11:42.243 --> 11:46.871
- Look, we both have the Annie soundtrack.
- Honey, both yours.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.876
Hey, great advice on that Joey thing.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.379
- Yeah, the work problem?
- It was perfect.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.798
It felt like he was my friend again.

11:56.966 --> 12:01.553
- What problem did you tell him you have?
- Oh, that's not important.

12:02.096 --> 12:06.099
The point is,
I really think everything's gonna be okay.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.394
May I help you?

12:09.562 --> 12:13.314
You think you can just buy
my friend's baby?

12:21.031 --> 12:23.825
Isn't it funny how we kept
running into each other?

12:23.993 --> 12:26.119
It's as if someone really wants us
to be together.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.663
Someone does. Me.

12:28.831 --> 12:32.167
Ooh. Witty banter. Well done. Good.

12:32.334 --> 12:36.546
- So tell me a little bit about yourself.
- Oh, okay. Well, I'm a masseuse.

12:36.714 --> 12:41.426
- And I used to work at this place...
- Do you like to party?

12:43.429 --> 12:45.555
I... I like parties.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.224
You're wild, aren't you? Heh.

12:49.643 --> 12:54.355
- Yeah, I guess. A little.
- Ain't no thing. I'm wild too.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.028
So, um, anyway...

13:00.488 --> 13:04.491
...I... I've lived in New York,
somewhat wildly, I guess...

13:04.658 --> 13:07.869
...for, um... Well, since I was 14.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.455
I'm sorry. I'm staring.

13:10.623 --> 13:14.709
It's just that you have
the most beautiful eyes.

13:14.877 --> 13:15.960
Oh, stop it.

13:16.128 --> 13:18.630
And your breasts. Mm!

13:21.759 --> 13:23.218
Okay. Ahem.

13:23.385 --> 13:26.179
Look, uh, you're coming on
a little strong.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.515
But I'm gonna give you
the benefit of the doubt.

13:28.682 --> 13:31.935
Because it seems the universe
really wants us to be together.

13:32.102 --> 13:36.231
So why don't we start over, okay?
You can just tell me about yourself.

13:36.398 --> 13:38.316
- All right.
- Okay.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.444
I write erotic novels...

13:41.612 --> 13:43.154
...for children.

13:45.825 --> 13:48.409
- What?
- They're wildly unpopular.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.162
Oh, my God.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.165
Also, you might be interested to know
that I have a Ph.D.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.210
- Wow, you do?
- Yep. A pretty huge...

13:57.378 --> 13:58.795
All right.

14:02.132 --> 14:04.884
The sun will come out tomorrow

14:05.052 --> 14:09.514
Bet your bottom dollar
That tomorrow

14:11.016 --> 14:12.308
There'll be sun

14:14.895 --> 14:16.813
- Hey.
- Hey, Joey, honey, listen.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.649
Thank you for talking to me yesterday
about that thing with my boss.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.986
- That really meant a lot.
- Not a problem. Oh, and just so you know...

14:23.153 --> 14:26.865
...that guy's not gonna be bothering you
about that baby thing anymore.

14:29.493 --> 14:32.245
- What?
- Let's just say I took care of it.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.290
Ooh, let's say more.

14:35.457 --> 14:38.626
Don't worry, don't worry.
I just told him, very nicely:

14:38.794 --> 14:42.005
"You don't go buying people's babies,
so back off."

14:42.840 --> 14:45.091
- What?
- What?

14:45.259 --> 14:46.384
No, no, no.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.679
Joey, he doesn't wanna buy my baby.
I made that up.

14:49.847 --> 14:52.098
What? Why?

14:52.349 --> 14:55.435
So that we would have something
to talk about so it wouldn't be awkward.

14:55.603 --> 14:58.354
And you couldn't think of anything else?

14:58.564 --> 15:02.233
You said your boss
wants to buy your baby?

15:02.401 --> 15:04.360
I can't believe you yelled at my boss.

15:04.528 --> 15:06.779
I'm gonna lose my job.
What am I gonna do?

15:06.947 --> 15:08.448
You could always sell your baby.

15:10.993 --> 15:14.913
Joey, I cannot believe you brought
my boss into this. I'm gonna get fired.

15:15.080 --> 15:18.041
- You lied to me.
- Well, she told me to.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.544
Chandler has two copies of Annie.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.646
Ah.

16:02.670 --> 16:03.795
Oh, my God.

16:04.505 --> 16:07.924
- Ross!
- Hello.

16:08.842 --> 16:10.301
Ross, what are you doing?

16:10.469 --> 16:16.391
Not touching myself, if that makes
anyone less uncomfortable.

16:20.854 --> 16:23.356
Morning. You wanted to see me?

16:23.524 --> 16:26.401
Please, come in. Have a seat.

16:28.696 --> 16:31.739
- Okay, look, Mr. Zelner...
- Oh, I think it's best that I speak first.

16:31.907 --> 16:33.116
Yeah.

16:34.910 --> 16:39.914
I've asked Lee from human resources
to be here as a witness to our conversation.

16:40.165 --> 16:41.582
Oh, God.

16:42.543 --> 16:48.798
If I in any way implied
that I wanted to buy your baby...

16:51.135 --> 16:53.219
...I am sorry. Okay?

16:53.387 --> 16:56.973
Last week, when I asked you
when your due date was, uh...

16:57.141 --> 17:02.520
...I certainly did not mean that
I felt that I was due your baby.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.898
Yeah, I want to be very clear...

17:07.067 --> 17:10.403
...that I understand that it's your baby...

17:10.904 --> 17:14.449
...and it is not mine to purchase.

17:20.329 --> 17:23.875
Well, as long as we are clear about that.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.428
Oh, there it is.

17:35.596 --> 17:37.972
- That's not your regular dry cleaners.
- I know.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.350
But that creep I went on that date with
goes there so I had to find a new one.

17:41.518 --> 17:43.936
I also have to find a new video store,
a new bank...

17:44.104 --> 17:46.355
...a new adult bookstore,
a new grocery store...

17:46.607 --> 17:50.109
- What?
- A new grocery store.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.864
The universe said I was gonna meet
a nice guy and that's what they gave me?

17:55.032 --> 17:58.326
When I get up there,
I'm gonna kick some ass.

17:58.494 --> 18:00.536
Don't worry, Phoebe,
you're gonna meet someone.

18:00.704 --> 18:02.705
If I can meet a great guy,
so can you.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.750
Yeah, we both can. And we both will.

18:10.380 --> 18:13.216
- Oh, you didn't have to come in with me.
- Are you kidding?

18:13.383 --> 18:17.095
This is where they get out stains.
This is like Disneyland for me.

18:18.514 --> 18:22.975
I'm gonna be over here
watching the dance of the clean shirts.

18:26.772 --> 18:29.315
Oh, excuse me.
I think you, uh, dropped...

18:31.026 --> 18:33.027
- Wow.
- What?

18:33.195 --> 18:35.822
I'm sorry, it's just that
you're so incredibly beautiful.

18:35.989 --> 18:40.118
Oh, yeah, well, I'm sorry about that too.
But what are you gonna do?

18:40.285 --> 18:43.746
I hope you don't think I'm crazy,
but I feel like I was meant to pick this up.

18:43.914 --> 18:48.042
- Do you believe in that kind of thing?
- A little. Heh.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.128
Now you're talking.

18:50.796 --> 18:54.465
- Would you like to go have a cup of coffee?
- I'd love to. Let me just tell my friend.

18:54.633 --> 18:58.594
Ooh. An ink stain.
Hey, can I watch how you get this out?

18:59.888 --> 19:01.889
She must have left.

19:05.435 --> 19:08.187
- Hi.
- So, what happened?

19:08.355 --> 19:09.397
It's all gonna be okay.

19:09.565 --> 19:11.232
They're just so happy
I'm not suing them...

19:11.400 --> 19:14.318
...that they gave me one extra month
paid maternity leave.

19:14.528 --> 19:17.530
So long as I understand that the money
should not be construed...

19:17.698 --> 19:22.243
...as a down payment on this
or any other child that I may bear.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.871
Wow. Ralph Lauren
is going out of their way...

19:25.038 --> 19:27.832
...to show that they're not
in the baby-buying business.

19:29.293 --> 19:31.669
- Chandler, can you give us a minute?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.172
- You're kicking me out of my living room?
- Yeah.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.383
I'll be in there.

19:42.181 --> 19:46.309
Joey, I'm really sorry that I lied to you.
I was just trying to make things...

19:46.476 --> 19:48.853
I know. I know.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.355
But it kind of worked.

19:51.523 --> 19:53.191
I mean, you know,
I don't know about you...

19:53.358 --> 19:55.693
...but I haven't thought about our thing
since all this.

19:56.320 --> 19:58.070
Yeah, you're right.

19:58.864 --> 20:02.617
Yeah. It's kind of been like us again,
a little bit.

20:02.784 --> 20:06.037
- Yeah, I know. I've missed that.
- Me too.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.790
I mean, I haven't thought at all
about how I put myself out there...

20:09.958 --> 20:13.377
...and said that stuff and how
you didn't feel the same way about me...

20:13.545 --> 20:17.924
...and how it was really awkward.

20:25.474 --> 20:27.892
My gynecologist tried to kill me.

20:34.942 --> 20:38.736
Item J437-A.

20:38.904 --> 20:41.864
Color: Winterberry.

20:49.456 --> 20:52.166
Hi, um, listen.
Come here. Come...

20:52.334 --> 20:55.044
I'm so, so sorry about yesterday.

20:55.796 --> 20:57.922
I'm really, really sorry. It's just...

20:58.090 --> 21:02.802
Listen, Ross, you don't have to apologize.
I understand why you were there.

21:03.136 --> 21:06.013
- You do?
- Yeah. You still have feelings for me.

21:06.181 --> 21:10.268
And to be honest,
I still have feelings for you too...

21:10.435 --> 21:12.895
...and I wish we could work out, Ross,
but we can't.

21:13.063 --> 21:17.316
It's too complicated with you
and Rachel and the baby. I just...

21:18.735 --> 21:20.444
It just wasn't meant to be.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.115
Oh, God. You're right.

21:25.617 --> 21:29.537
- Ross, we have to be strong.
- Mm.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.000
Okay, I'm gonna go.

21:36.503 --> 21:39.797
Can I? To remember you?

21:44.011 --> 21:45.761
No.
