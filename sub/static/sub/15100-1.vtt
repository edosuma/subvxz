00:26.860 --> 00:28.794
Corey! Corey!

03:39.118 --> 03:42.383
Hey. I'm so glad
you made it to town.

03:42.422 --> 03:43.684
Didn't I tell you
I'd set you up?

03:43.723 --> 03:45.850
Where am I supposed to put
all this stuff, anyway?

03:45.892 --> 03:48.417
Right back here.
It's the new guest house.

03:48.461 --> 03:49.621
Pretty cool, huh?

03:50.396 --> 03:51.624
-Rad.
-What?

03:52.131 --> 03:54.099
Is this where Corey's
gonna reside now?

03:54.133 --> 03:55.430
No, man.
He's just gonna live here.

03:55.468 --> 03:56.662
Hey, Tyler,
where's the new ramp?

03:56.703 --> 03:58.637
I got to train
for the pool competition.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.741
Whoa. Nice ramp, guys.

04:12.785 --> 04:13.945
All right.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.494
All right! Yeah.

04:22.996 --> 04:25.487
-Come on, Bozy.
-Come on, Boze.

04:25.531 --> 04:27.158
Yeah! Come on. Come on!

04:27.200 --> 04:28.360
Come on, Boze.

04:29.035 --> 04:30.502
Get it, Boze. Get up.

04:30.536 --> 04:31.764
Yeah! Get it!

04:32.405 --> 04:33.565
Come on, Bozy.

04:35.775 --> 04:36.935
You got it.

04:37.677 --> 04:39.508
All right. Way to go.

04:39.545 --> 04:40.534
Come on, Tyler. You first.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.680
Yeah. You designed it.

04:43.249 --> 04:44.238
Nope. Nope.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.308
You guys go first.
Someone else.

04:45.351 --> 04:46.318
Oh, man. Come on.

04:46.352 --> 04:47.979
You mean, Mr. Studly
is giving up...

04:48.021 --> 04:49.613
first shot at a virgin ramp?

04:50.256 --> 04:52.622
-That's right.
-Really?

04:52.659 --> 04:54.183
So who's first?

04:56.462 --> 04:57.451
Webster

04:57.497 --> 04:59.897
No way, man. You guys built it.
You guys go first.

04:59.932 --> 05:04.266
-Come on, Webster.
-Look. We need your opinion.

05:04.871 --> 05:06.862
-You want my opinion?
-That's right.

05:06.906 --> 05:08.396
OK. You got my opinion.

05:09.742 --> 05:11.039
Tear it up.

05:36.235 --> 05:37.395
All right!

06:20.179 --> 06:21.339
Great!

06:21.981 --> 06:22.970
All right!

06:55.014 --> 06:56.174
Tequila

06:59.051 --> 07:00.143
Tequila

07:01.888 --> 07:05.619
-Cool quad-rubbers, Boze.
-Sit back and shut up.

07:05.658 --> 07:08.126
Hey, I got shotgun next.
I'm tired of sitting bitch.

07:08.161 --> 07:09.355
All right. It's all right.

07:09.395 --> 07:10.760
Let's just get
to the beach, huh?

07:10.797 --> 07:11.855
Oh, God, Tyler.

07:11.898 --> 07:13.832
Look, fellas. Look.
12 o'clock high--

07:13.866 --> 07:15.800
tasty skatebetties, boy.

07:16.602 --> 07:18.900
Oh, God, I love California.

07:20.239 --> 07:22.366
-Come on.
-Hot pink.

07:22.408 --> 07:26.401
Yo, baby! Hi.
You love me, right?

07:26.446 --> 07:28.744
I'm classy. I swear.
I know him.

07:51.871 --> 07:55.432
Hey, guys. Guys. Check it out.
It's Hook and the Daggers.

07:56.209 --> 07:59.144
-Thinks he's such a badass.
-Yeah.

07:59.178 --> 08:01.442
What are those guys
trying to prove, anyway?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.540
Man, the guy's
a killer, you know?

08:03.583 --> 08:06.143
-I heard he actually--
-Hey, look. Monk's with him.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.584
So what? He smells.

08:07.620 --> 08:09.053
Yeah? Well, I caught him
spying on our ramp...

08:09.088 --> 08:10.555
when we were trying to build it.

08:10.590 --> 08:12.888
Yeah. Well, I knew him
when he was Ralph...

08:12.925 --> 08:14.483
and he lived in the valley, man.

08:14.527 --> 08:16.757
Now he's Monk,
and he thinks he's cool.

09:54.827 --> 09:56.454
Breaking is a memory.

10:06.706 --> 10:07.866
For wimps.

10:24.390 --> 10:26.517
Wild, man. Acid rock.

10:27.560 --> 10:28.720
Gnarly.

10:53.285 --> 10:54.445
Hey, let's check it out.

10:55.554 --> 10:56.521
Come on, Webster.

10:56.555 --> 10:57.783
Let's me and you
shred the path, huh?

10:57.823 --> 10:58.983
Gotcha.

11:03.462 --> 11:05.123
Come on, man.

11:06.766 --> 11:08.199
Damn, man.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.803
-Hold it, Corey.
-What's wrong, man?

11:47.373 --> 11:48.601
Look. I don't think
we should be here.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.542
-Why not?
-This is the Daggers' place.

11:53.546 --> 11:54.706
Daggers, huh?

11:56.549 --> 11:57.709
Corey...

12:08.360 --> 12:09.827
Beat it, you Val jerk.

13:12.124 --> 13:13.421
All right, Per.

13:27.873 --> 13:28.840
Hey, Chrissy.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.808
Hi, Velvet. How are you?
Watch this guy.

13:32.945 --> 13:34.537
Freestyle. Come on.

13:34.580 --> 13:36.548
No, wait.
He's almost finished.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.418
Hey, Chrissy,
your brother's waiting.

13:50.796 --> 13:53.765
-Corey! Dude!
-Hey, Per. How you doing?

13:53.799 --> 13:54.891
What are you doing in Dogtown?

13:54.934 --> 13:56.367
Just here for the summer...

13:56.402 --> 13:58.529
and I'm doing the L.A. Massacre
next week...

13:58.571 --> 13:59.765
a pool competition tomorrow.

14:10.349 --> 14:13.182
Chrissy, don't waste your time.
He's no Dagger.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.386
Hey, come on.
Stop messing around.

14:15.421 --> 14:16.649
This is serious.
Be cool, you guys.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.088
Come here. Velvet, come here.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.249
All right. Chrissy.
Chrissy, get in here.

14:20.292 --> 14:21.759
Come on. Hurry up.

14:21.794 --> 14:23.625
Get a picture of me
and my brat sister here.

14:24.129 --> 14:26.029
She's visiting for the summer
from lndiana, man.

14:26.065 --> 14:27.032
Tommy. Come on.

14:27.066 --> 14:28.556
We're gonna make her
a movie star, aren't we?

14:28.601 --> 14:29.761
Yeah, right.

14:30.169 --> 14:33.002
-That's great. One more.
-Yeah! Daggers!

14:35.841 --> 14:39.504
-Boze, it's so hot in here, man.
-We're not gonna make it.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.773
Hey, Bozo, man...

14:40.813 --> 14:43.441
where's the air conditioning
in this car, huh?

14:43.482 --> 14:45.416
My father said
I wouldn't need it.

14:45.451 --> 14:47.180
I don't know. I wanted
to get the convertible...

14:47.219 --> 14:48.584
but he talked me
into this model.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.680
I knew I should have gotten
that ragtop.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.987
You really want a convertible?

14:53.626 --> 14:54.786
Yeah.

14:55.527 --> 14:56.687
Definitely?

14:57.496 --> 14:59.657
Sure. Why not?

15:06.572 --> 15:09.871
My brand-new car.
My father's gonna murder me.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.467
What are you talking about, man?

15:11.510 --> 15:14.411
You tell your father that this
was professionally done, Boze.

15:16.315 --> 15:17.475
Come on, fellas.

15:17.516 --> 15:19.381
Help me take the top off
this thing.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.749
Aw, man.

15:21.687 --> 15:22.915
Yeah. I got it.

15:24.323 --> 15:27.190
-All right. Good work, Radster.
-Thank you.

15:27.226 --> 15:28.693
He's gonna murder me.

15:29.295 --> 15:31.786
Well, if my shop teacher
saw me doing this...

15:31.830 --> 15:34.162
instead of them stupid ashtrays
he had me doing...

15:35.167 --> 15:37.158
But it looks like an ashtray.

15:37.703 --> 15:39.671
No, it does not.
You know what you've got here?

15:39.705 --> 15:42.196
-This is a cabri-o-lette, man.
-What's that?

15:42.241 --> 15:45.733
That's Hungarian for "fast car."

15:46.512 --> 15:47.945
-Really?
-Yeah.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.845
Hey, let's paint the sucker.

16:01.927 --> 16:05.226
Boze, you just got yourself
a skate cruiser.

16:05.264 --> 16:07.198
Oh, this car drives funny.

16:23.782 --> 16:26.512
-Yeah?
-Tommy? It's me.

16:26.552 --> 16:28.315
-Hey. Come on in.
-Hi.

16:33.525 --> 16:34.822
Where have you been?
It's late.

16:34.860 --> 16:37.055
I went to the mall to get
a dress for tonight.

16:37.763 --> 16:38.923
Look.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.798
You're gonna be the most
beautiful girl at the club.

16:50.376 --> 16:52.173
I liked Venice today.
It was fun.

16:52.211 --> 16:53.678
Yeah. Wild scene, huh?

16:54.546 --> 16:56.480
You don't see those kind
of freaks in lndiana.

16:57.750 --> 17:00.014
I like the skaters
and those break dancers.

17:00.052 --> 17:02.145
Breakers?
What do you think?

17:02.187 --> 17:05.020
Should I wear this
skull and the dagger...

17:05.891 --> 17:07.915
or the hoop and the dagger?

17:08.627 --> 17:12.426
Nah. Just wear the dagger...
and a bone for your nose.

17:13.098 --> 17:15.498
Don't be a smart ass.
It's important to me.

17:17.536 --> 17:20.505
-A bone, huh?
-Tommy.

17:21.707 --> 17:23.071
Hey, Corey!

17:23.108 --> 17:25.008
Come on.
You'll miss the girls.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.978
Yeah. I'm coming!
I'm coming, all right?

17:45.531 --> 17:47.021
-All right.
-Radley.

17:47.066 --> 17:48.533
Yo. What's up, man?

17:48.567 --> 17:50.364
All right, Corey. Let's go.

17:51.303 --> 17:52.463
Hey. Wait a minute.

17:53.205 --> 17:57.073
Hey. Hey, Engledork...
out of the car, huh?

17:57.576 --> 17:59.840
Yeah, buddy.
This is where we separate...

17:59.878 --> 18:01.846
the men from the boys.

18:03.615 --> 18:05.082
Hit it, Boze.

18:05.117 --> 18:06.778
Hey, come on. Look.
It makes me taller.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.753
-Ah, no.
-Sorry.

18:10.289 --> 18:11.950
I hope you don't get laid!

18:32.144 --> 18:34.305
-Yo.
-Stay right there, brother.

18:35.981 --> 18:36.948
What's this shit?

18:36.982 --> 18:37.949
It's called a bottle
in my lang--

18:37.983 --> 18:39.382
-Got any more?
-No.

18:41.487 --> 18:42.511
Maybe one.

18:42.554 --> 18:44.146
-That the last one?
-Yeah.

18:44.189 --> 18:45.349
Hey! Ouch.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.415
Gargantua, please.
Don't touch my Elvis.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.756
-That's cute.
-Yeah. Later.

18:48.794 --> 18:49.988
Hold on.

18:53.198 --> 18:54.392
What, are you starting
your own bar inside, man?

18:54.433 --> 18:55.422
Take a hike.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.502
Chicks, man.
There's chicks here.

18:58.537 --> 19:00.402
-Wild.
-Long time, no see, buddy.

19:03.542 --> 19:06.136
Hey, Radley, give me
some of that jet fuel, man.

19:06.178 --> 19:08.169
The dude at the door
scammed all my bottles, man.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.373
I don't have nothing.

19:10.949 --> 19:14.146
-Hey, Boze, buddy. You thirsty?
-Yeah.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.676
Boze is thirsty.
Hey, man, you want a drink?

19:15.721 --> 19:16.688
Yeah.

19:16.722 --> 19:19.623
-Hey, drinks on the Bozeman.
-Hey, all right, Boze, man.

19:19.658 --> 19:20.852
Let's rock.

19:24.596 --> 19:26.427
This is raw!

19:40.012 --> 19:41.843
-Hey, Rocky.
-All right, Hook.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.074
My little sister Chrissy, bro.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.548
All right, bro. Yeah.

20:14.913 --> 20:16.141
At this time,
ladies and gentlemen...

20:16.181 --> 20:17.478
you're going to hear
from a band...

20:17.516 --> 20:19.108
a quartet of patented
gentlemen...

20:19.151 --> 20:22.416
to rival those faces
even on Mount Rushmore.

20:22.454 --> 20:23.751
Ladies and gentlemen...

20:23.789 --> 20:27.418
will you please give
your most warm welcome?

20:27.459 --> 20:30.292
The fabulous
Red Hot Chili Peppers...

20:30.329 --> 20:32.923
the band that gets
your pulses pounding...

20:32.965 --> 20:36.196
your senses reeling,
and sets your mouth on fire...

20:36.235 --> 20:38.203
but right now,
ladies and gentlemen...

20:38.237 --> 20:40.364
it's time for the Thrash Bash.

20:50.315 --> 20:51.680
Pumpin' the blood through
the heart of New Orleans...

20:51.717 --> 20:53.048
Radster!

20:53.085 --> 20:54.245
Bourbon Street dream

20:54.286 --> 20:55.548
She's just made
out of flesh and bone

20:55.587 --> 20:57.885
But let me tell you, little boy,
you better leave her alone

21:04.263 --> 21:06.527
Yeah, Leroy Brown
thought he was bad, too

21:06.565 --> 21:08.533
Till she left him floatin'
in the old bayou

21:08.567 --> 21:10.057
She's the kind of girl,
she's built like a bomb

21:10.102 --> 21:12.070
She's the black eyed,
black eyed, black eyed blonde

21:12.104 --> 21:13.093
Get down

21:15.173 --> 21:16.504
Get it straight

21:18.443 --> 21:19.501
She's black

21:22.247 --> 21:23.441
She's blonde

21:26.585 --> 21:28.519
That black eyed beauty
with the golden crotch

21:28.553 --> 21:30.248
French electric sex cock
shocking swamp fox

21:30.289 --> 21:31.950
Heathen queen of sleaze,
she's hot to box

21:31.990 --> 21:34.356
But let me tell you, little boy,
she'll clean your clock

21:41.400 --> 21:43.163
A slick and sly spy
stuck in the muck of the moat

21:43.201 --> 21:44.828
Oh, blew his mind to find
a diamond in the boat

21:44.870 --> 21:46.565
Double-o doomsday
for Mr. James Bond

21:46.605 --> 21:48.573
She's the black eyed,
black eyed, black eyed blonde

21:48.607 --> 21:49.631
Get down

21:54.579 --> 21:55.637
Black eyed "b," go

21:58.850 --> 21:59.839
She's blonde

22:15.534 --> 22:17.297
God, those kids
are crazy in there.

22:19.037 --> 22:21.471
Back home in lndiana you don't
see that kind of stuff.

22:21.506 --> 22:22.473
Oh, yeah?

22:22.507 --> 22:25.340
Just frat parties
and homecoming dances.

22:25.377 --> 22:27.402
They're just thrashers.
They're all right.

22:27.946 --> 22:28.913
Thrashers.

22:28.947 --> 22:32.075
That sounds like vandals
or juvenile delinquents...

22:32.117 --> 22:33.084
troubled youth.

22:33.118 --> 22:34.915
No. Thrashing, man.

22:34.953 --> 22:37.547
It's just an aggressive
style of skating.

22:37.589 --> 22:39.250
You know, we thrash.

22:40.892 --> 22:42.484
Well, what do you thrash?

22:43.295 --> 22:44.455
What do you got?

22:47.899 --> 22:49.196
Oh, God.

22:55.273 --> 22:57.002
What do you think,
you're a wild one or something?

22:57.042 --> 22:58.202
Maybe.

23:01.480 --> 23:03.948
What are you hanging out
with those clones for?

23:03.982 --> 23:05.813
Daggers, why are you
hanging out with them?

23:07.486 --> 23:10.819
I just met most of those guys,
but you know Tommy?

23:11.690 --> 23:13.055
Everyone around here
calls him Hook?

23:13.859 --> 23:16.453
Yeah, yeah. I know of Hook.
Punk poseur.

23:20.198 --> 23:21.358
That's my brother.

23:23.268 --> 23:24.565
And I'm a jerk.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.069
Nah. You're OK.

23:31.643 --> 23:33.270
Leroy Brown
thought he was bad, too

23:33.311 --> 23:35.472
Till she left him floatin'
in the old bayou

23:35.514 --> 23:36.981
She's the kind of girl,
she's built like a bomb

23:37.015 --> 23:38.710
She's the black eyed,
black eyed, black eyed blonde

23:42.387 --> 23:43.376
Get down

23:52.431 --> 23:54.399
Spiders, skulls, and bones?

23:54.433 --> 23:56.663
It's just the scene.
You want to try it?

23:56.701 --> 23:58.532
No, no, no.
Those are dangerous.

23:58.570 --> 24:00.936
Oh, come on.
I'll show you how to do it.

24:00.972 --> 24:03.736
-Don't be afraid, all right?
-I'm not afraid.

24:05.844 --> 24:07.004
Try it.

24:12.150 --> 24:14.414
Put your foot right there.
You got it.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.087
You got me?

24:16.121 --> 24:17.088
Yeah, I got you.
Don't worry about it.

24:17.122 --> 24:18.282
-You ready?
-Yeah.

24:28.500 --> 24:29.694
All right.

24:35.273 --> 24:36.797
Yeah. It's kind of fun.

24:36.842 --> 24:39.037
Yeah, if you like
living dangerously.

24:42.714 --> 24:46.241
-So do you skate every day?
-Training right now.

24:46.284 --> 24:47.979
Training for a meet
called the L.A. Downhill.

24:48.019 --> 24:50.579
-You wouldn't know of it.
-Sure. The downhill.

24:50.622 --> 24:52.852
-How do you know of it?
-My brother's doing that one.

24:52.891 --> 24:53.858
Oh, your brother, huh?

24:53.892 --> 24:56.019
Yeah. He's been talking about it
ever since I got here.

24:57.028 --> 24:59.895
He says they pay $1,000
to the winner of some race.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.857
It's no little race.
It's a downhill.

25:02.901 --> 25:05.267
You never been
to a downhill, have you?

25:07.205 --> 25:11.642
25, 30 guys racing at speeds
of 40, 50 miles an hour.

25:13.278 --> 25:14.939
Can't imagine the energy
of it, you know?

25:14.980 --> 25:18.006
It's intense, and sometimes
they're racing on the boards...

25:18.049 --> 25:20.609
and the board starts
to shake and wham!

25:21.887 --> 25:23.718
Need a spatula to peel
you off the street.

25:23.755 --> 25:24.722
Sounds like fun.

25:24.756 --> 25:26.485
-You should try it sometime.
-OK.

26:45.670 --> 26:47.570
Oh, my God.
Look how late it is.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.573
We better go.

26:48.607 --> 26:51.337
Come on. I got that pool
competition in four hours.

26:51.376 --> 26:52.536
Come on.

26:55.780 --> 26:57.748
Aren't you gonna wish me luck?

26:57.782 --> 27:00.546
I wish I could be there.
Good luck.

27:22.974 --> 27:25.636
-Where have you been?
-God, you scared me.

27:25.677 --> 27:28.942
Good because you scared me.
Where were you?

27:28.980 --> 27:32.006
-Out.
-What do you mean you were out?

27:32.050 --> 27:34.075
I go to the club last night
with my kid sister...

27:34.119 --> 27:37.054
and I'm going--hey,
don't drink that.

27:38.823 --> 27:40.347
Oh! It's foul.

27:41.559 --> 27:44.687
-So where were you?
-You're not my boss, Tommy.

27:44.729 --> 27:47.391
Hey, I'm the older brother.
I'm the one in charge.

27:47.432 --> 27:48.899
You're the one in charge, huh?

27:48.933 --> 27:50.332
You send Mom a picture...

27:50.368 --> 27:51.733
of you looking
like some wild lndian...

27:51.770 --> 27:53.101
and you're the one in charge?

27:54.005 --> 27:56.098
That wild lndian picture
happens to be styling.

27:56.141 --> 27:57.335
You don't know what you're
talking about.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.275
Don't you think Mom's
concerned about you, Tommy?

28:03.081 --> 28:05.413
Maybe I'm out here
looking after you.

28:05.917 --> 28:06.975
That's a joke.

28:07.652 --> 28:09.017
If this is the way
it's gonna be, Chrissy...

28:09.054 --> 28:10.248
I don't even want you here.

28:10.755 --> 28:12.689
You can just go back to lndiana.

28:14.125 --> 28:15.422
Fine.

28:16.428 --> 28:18.521
Look, Tommy. I'm sorry, OK?

28:19.397 --> 28:22.491
I should have come home.
I lost all track of time.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.694
I'm sorry.

28:34.512 --> 28:36.377
So where were you, huh?

28:39.918 --> 28:41.351
Well, I met this guy.

28:41.920 --> 28:43.820
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

28:44.756 --> 28:47.224
-What's his name?
-Corey.

28:50.495 --> 28:51.826
Does he live around here?

28:51.863 --> 28:53.797
Not too far away.
Somewhere over the hill.

28:53.832 --> 28:56.733
-He's from the valley?
-I think so.

28:57.602 --> 29:00.127
Chrissy, how many times
have I told you--

29:00.171 --> 29:03.265
you hang around here,
you hang out with Daggers.

29:03.308 --> 29:08.041
If not, just go home, OK?
That's it.

29:08.079 --> 29:10.240
-Fine.
-Fine.

29:10.281 --> 29:13.512
Hey, Scarface,
want to come to bed now?

29:18.590 --> 29:20.353
We still need our skaters that
made the final cut...

29:20.391 --> 29:21.449
to get their safety gear on...

29:21.493 --> 29:23.518
and check in with our starter
in the officials' area.

29:23.561 --> 29:25.358
At this reading, it looks
like any of our finalists...

29:25.396 --> 29:27.159
have a shot
at winning this thing.

29:27.198 --> 29:28.529
Among those skaters
shooting at the trophies...

29:28.566 --> 29:31.535
are Mark McCarthy,
Corey Webster...

29:31.569 --> 29:34.800
Timmy Hanks, Vincent Haloy,
and Lou Range.

29:34.839 --> 29:36.807
We still need Corey and Vincent
to check in.

29:36.841 --> 29:37.933
The big question is...

29:37.976 --> 29:40.342
who can pull off the McTwist
here in the final round?

29:52.423 --> 29:55.324
Took a nice backside turn,
an extended handplant.

30:12.977 --> 30:16.469
540 air. He follows it
with a backside air.

30:16.514 --> 30:20.314
There's that backside carve.
Here it is.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.490
Backside carve.

30:26.524 --> 30:29.584
He uses that speed for an
incredible bionic backside air.

31:26.818 --> 31:28.979
Boy, this vertical skating
is risky business.

31:29.020 --> 31:31.488
Hal Luccio is out of the running
in the first round...

31:31.522 --> 31:32.955
due to an injury.

31:32.991 --> 31:35.186
Skaters can grab
another warm-up run.

31:35.226 --> 31:37.854
Boy, Hal Luccio is hurt.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.830
Corey Webster is on deck
to follow that...

31:39.864 --> 31:41.991
but it's going to be
a tough act to follow.

31:42.033 --> 31:44.092
Hal Luccio is
still grabbing his ankle.

31:44.135 --> 31:46.399
Corey Webster is up.
We'll see what he does.

31:46.437 --> 31:48.371
This young man,
under a lot of pressure.

31:48.406 --> 31:50.397
It's hard to come right
straight ahead into a heat...

31:50.441 --> 31:52.807
after the guy in front of you
has taken a bad wipeout.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.540
Here's the countdown for Corey.

31:57.048 --> 31:58.413
The pressure is on.

31:59.484 --> 32:01.042
One second. Corey drops in.

32:02.053 --> 32:04.078
He starts with
a nice backside carve...

32:04.722 --> 32:07.657
sets it up into
an El Gario tail tap.

32:07.692 --> 32:09.023
What a maneuver!

32:09.060 --> 32:10.652
Connects it with
a finger flip handplant.

32:10.695 --> 32:14.028
Setting it up
with another backside air.

32:15.033 --> 32:16.864
Webster is ripping
this pool apart.

32:16.901 --> 32:18.061
Here's a difficult judo air.

32:18.102 --> 32:19.626
What a maneuver.
What a strong run.

32:19.671 --> 32:21.502
Webster, with another handplant.

32:22.340 --> 32:23.898
Let's see what he does next.

32:23.942 --> 32:26.274
It's a 360 handplant.

32:26.311 --> 32:27.835
This guy is tearing it apart.

32:28.513 --> 32:30.981
And here comes his next trick.

32:31.015 --> 32:33.108
It's going to be
a hot frontside grind.

32:33.151 --> 32:35.210
What a routine!

32:35.253 --> 32:36.652
A couple more maneuvers
from Webster...

32:36.688 --> 32:37.655
before he runs out of time.

32:37.689 --> 32:38.883
A backside air.

32:39.757 --> 32:41.156
He must have taken it because--

32:41.192 --> 32:42.557
Oh, Webster is down.

32:46.264 --> 32:48.232
Oh, Webster is hurt!

32:48.266 --> 32:50.325
Medics, please report
to the pool immediately.

32:50.368 --> 32:51.995
Corey Webster, at the bottom
of the transition...

32:52.036 --> 32:55.563
not able to hang on to his board
and unexplainably falls off.

32:55.606 --> 32:57.233
This kid is in pain.

32:57.275 --> 32:59.140
Medics, please--
your attention please--

32:59.177 --> 33:00.109
to the poolside.

33:00.845 --> 33:03.609
Boy, what a tough break
for Corey Webster.

33:03.648 --> 33:05.878
Our judges still have to give
Corey a score for his run...

33:05.917 --> 33:07.578
but that fall will
cost him dearly.

33:07.618 --> 33:09.176
What a shame.

33:09.220 --> 33:11.211
Our next skater up
is going to be Timmy Hanks...

33:13.358 --> 33:14.620
Daggers.

33:21.165 --> 33:22.223
Assholes.

33:23.134 --> 33:26.069
Webster, you just got snaked,
man, that's all.

33:26.904 --> 33:27.871
-Yeah.
-Yeah, man.

33:27.905 --> 33:29.634
Those Daggers are vile, bro.

33:30.708 --> 33:32.300
They think they rule L.A.

33:32.810 --> 33:35.142
Hey, who's the geeze?

33:35.179 --> 33:38.273
What are you, Bozo,
out of your blazing skull, man?

33:38.316 --> 33:39.613
That's Sam Flood.

33:39.650 --> 33:43.586
Bozo, he owns Smash Skateboards.

33:43.621 --> 33:46.181
I mean, they say he
invented skateboarding.

33:46.224 --> 33:47.589
Wow.

33:47.625 --> 33:49.991
I'm going to go talk to him.
I'll see you guys later.

33:50.028 --> 33:50.995
-All right.
-Good luck.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.361
-Get an autograph for me.
-Yeah, a free...t-shirt.

33:54.365 --> 33:55.491
Hey, Mr. Flood.

33:56.868 --> 33:57.835
Thank you.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.029
Mr. Flood.

34:00.538 --> 34:01.766
-I know you.
-Yeah.

34:01.806 --> 34:04.001
You're Webster, right?
Corey Webster?

34:04.042 --> 34:05.475
I like your style, kid.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.000
Thanks.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.239
Hey, you want to see something?

34:08.279 --> 34:09.405
-Sure.
-Look at that.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.779
-Oh, Mondo.
-Yeah.

34:11.815 --> 34:14.842
I signed him five minutes after
he won the Tahoe Downhill.

34:15.353 --> 34:17.786
You know, he's going
to make two bucks...

34:17.822 --> 34:19.312
off of each board I sell.

34:19.824 --> 34:22.292
You know, he'll probably make
twenty thousand this year...

34:22.326 --> 34:23.485
and I understand...

34:23.527 --> 34:25.655
he's also going to go
on tour with the Beach Boys.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.031
You win the L.A. Downhill...

34:30.068 --> 34:31.967
and you'll skate
for Smash Skates.

34:36.007 --> 34:38.440
If you're not doing
anything tomorrow, drop by.

34:38.476 --> 34:39.737
I'll give you
a tour of the factory.

34:39.777 --> 34:40.937
All right. Definitely.

34:42.179 --> 34:43.373
OK, kid!

34:43.414 --> 34:45.882
-Thanks a lot, Mr. Flood.
-Good seeing you, kid.

34:51.322 --> 34:56.385
OK, and then the application...
and...way to go.

34:57.428 --> 35:00.397
Hey, that's how it's done,
huh, Webster?

35:00.431 --> 35:01.728
-Like it?
-Yeah.

35:01.766 --> 35:02.960
Thank you, Paul.

35:04.135 --> 35:07.070
You know, Webster, I always like
to meet the new skaters.

35:07.972 --> 35:09.940
You did Del Mar, didn't you?

35:09.974 --> 35:10.941
Yeah, I did that one.

35:10.975 --> 35:13.944
Yeah. You know, a couple
more meets like that...

35:13.978 --> 35:16.276
you'll be skating Smash Skates.

35:17.048 --> 35:18.845
You know, I only
sign the winners...

35:20.084 --> 35:21.574
guys that are hot.

35:22.820 --> 35:24.788
Here. Take a look at this.

35:25.656 --> 35:27.351
See that?

35:27.391 --> 35:29.416
That's seven-ply--

35:29.460 --> 35:32.429
seven layers of a thin veneer...

35:32.463 --> 35:35.125
that are bonded
together, cross-grain...

35:35.166 --> 35:39.569
to form a board that's
practically indestructible.

35:46.110 --> 35:47.168
Go ahead. Bite that.

35:47.812 --> 35:49.109
Sink your teeth into it.

35:51.115 --> 35:54.243
This is a new secret
thermoplastic resin.

35:54.285 --> 35:57.083
In the event
of an atomic attack...

35:57.121 --> 35:59.089
this would be the only
thing that would survive.

35:59.123 --> 36:01.421
Call for Mr. Flood
on line three.

36:01.459 --> 36:02.949
Excuse me a second.

36:15.473 --> 36:17.304
I'm going to skate
for these guys.

36:18.476 --> 36:19.738
All right.
Hollywood Boulevard.

36:19.777 --> 36:20.937
Let's hit it, girls.

37:38.189 --> 37:40.555
All right. Coming through.
Watch out!

38:43.254 --> 38:44.983
Guys, get into it!

39:00.705 --> 39:01.865
Look out!

39:07.745 --> 39:09.042
Grab on to his bike.

39:12.083 --> 39:13.243
All right.

39:17.955 --> 39:19.388
That was great!

39:34.905 --> 39:37.305
Hey, Bozo. Bozo, come here.

39:38.342 --> 39:40.139
You see that really raw
chick over there, man?

39:40.978 --> 39:42.275
She came up to me inside.

39:42.313 --> 39:45.771
She told me that she thought
you were real, real, real fine.

39:45.816 --> 39:48.080
Yeah. So I thought maybe
if you got down in...

39:48.119 --> 39:49.518
Iike, a surf-two position,
you know...

39:49.553 --> 39:50.542
Iike this on the board...

39:51.622 --> 39:54.147
you know, as you go by,
they would really dig you.

39:54.191 --> 39:55.249
So put your board down.

39:55.292 --> 39:56.725
Get in, like,
a surf-two position.

39:56.761 --> 39:57.989
Here. Wait. Hold on.

40:08.739 --> 40:10.434
Come on. Go back
over there, Bozo.

40:12.510 --> 40:14.842
Hi. Nice eyes.

40:37.535 --> 40:39.366
Hello, Chrissy, is that you?

40:39.403 --> 40:41.371
Who may I ask
is speaking, please?

40:41.405 --> 40:43.566
This is Corey Webster.
Why? Who's this?

40:43.607 --> 40:46.440
Corey Webster. How you doing?

40:46.477 --> 40:48.411
I heard you had a little
accident yesterday.

40:48.446 --> 40:50.243
It was no accident,
Hook, and you know it.

40:50.281 --> 40:51.646
Now put Chrissy on the phone.

40:51.682 --> 40:54.708
Well, Chrissy's busy,
man, and, uh...

40:54.752 --> 40:56.310
she'll be busy for
the rest of the summer...

40:56.353 --> 40:58.947
so why don't you
not call back here?

40:58.989 --> 41:00.889
-Put her on the phone!
-Oh, and, Corey...

41:00.925 --> 41:03.485
you come near Chrissy again,
and you're dead meat.

41:03.527 --> 41:05.427
Oh, yeah?
Well, after the L.A. Massacre...

41:05.463 --> 41:06.487
you're dead meat, Hook.

41:06.997 --> 41:07.964
You'd just better make sure...

41:07.998 --> 41:09.431
I don't see your ass
before then.

41:09.467 --> 41:11.560
And, Corey, one more thing.

41:16.874 --> 41:18.068
Shit.

43:04.900 --> 43:06.700
Now, isn't this a coincidence?

43:06.800 --> 43:07.900
I come outside...

43:07.900 --> 43:10.400
at the same time you're
hanging out in my tree.

43:11.900 --> 43:13.300
Can I see you
for a few minutes?

43:13.800 --> 43:18.100
Just a few minutes?
Is that all it's going to take?

43:20.200 --> 43:23.100
-Hey, Chrissy.
-Hi, Velvet.

43:23.600 --> 43:26.200
Come on in. Chiffon's
ready to paint your face.

43:26.200 --> 43:27.600
OK. I'll be in in a second.

43:28.100 --> 43:31.100
-Are you OK?
-Yeah.

43:35.300 --> 43:38.500
Velvet, wait.
Don't tell Tommy, OK?

43:38.500 --> 43:42.100
OK, but get him
out of here now.

43:44.600 --> 43:46.900
-Come on. Hurry up.
-I'm coming.

43:47.700 --> 43:48.800
I thought you could fly.

43:51.700 --> 43:52.900
I can.

44:00.700 --> 44:02.200
I don't believe it.

44:02.300 --> 44:04.700
I'm proud of you, kid.
You did pretty good.

44:09.100 --> 44:11.900
-Where did you get that?
-What?

44:13.400 --> 44:17.100
Oh, I made it in art class
a while back.

44:17.600 --> 44:19.100
Why, you like it?

44:20.300 --> 44:21.500
Oh, yeah?

44:23.100 --> 44:24.300
Here. It's yours.

44:29.200 --> 44:30.700
Looks pretty on you.

44:31.700 --> 44:33.400
Thanks. I like it.

44:33.500 --> 44:34.600
There's something
I've got to show you.

44:34.600 --> 44:36.000
I've got to show you
the new graphics...

44:36.000 --> 44:37.200
I designed for
my new skateboard...

44:37.200 --> 44:39.900
and, Chrissy, when l
get pro sponsorship...

44:41.100 --> 44:42.600
I'm going to have
the hottest model.

44:42.600 --> 44:45.200
-Just wait till you see it.
-What's the design look like?

44:45.200 --> 44:48.000
-OK. There's this web, right?
-Yeah.

44:48.100 --> 44:49.300
And there's
this tarantula on it.

44:49.400 --> 44:51.200
Well, there's this girl
on the tarantula...

44:51.300 --> 44:52.600
with the spider on...

44:52.600 --> 44:55.000
-What's wrong?
-Look.

44:59.400 --> 45:00.700
Come on. Let's go.

45:00.800 --> 45:02.000
We're not leaving
because of those guys.

45:02.100 --> 45:03.200
Come on. Let's just go.

45:03.200 --> 45:04.400
Chrissy, what's
the big deal with--

45:04.400 --> 45:05.900
You don't understand.
If my brother finds out...

45:05.900 --> 45:07.300
I'm with you tonight,
he'll kill me.

45:07.400 --> 45:08.500
Chrissy, he's not
going to kill you.

45:08.500 --> 45:11.500
Come on. I'll explain outside.
Let's just go.

45:11.600 --> 45:12.500
Come on.

45:12.600 --> 45:14.800
We'll go. OK.
You want to go, we'll go.

45:16.300 --> 45:18.400
Money. Got to pay
the money, then we'll go.

45:23.000 --> 45:26.100
It's around here somewhere.
Here it is.

45:26.100 --> 45:28.600
Still a little rough,
but what do you think?

45:29.600 --> 45:31.100
I don't know.
It seems a little aggressive...

45:31.100 --> 45:32.100
don't you think?

45:33.600 --> 45:36.500
Yeah, aggressive, and that's
what sells skateboards.

45:40.300 --> 45:41.700
You'd like to be held like that?

45:44.900 --> 45:45.900
Oh, yeah.

45:45.900 --> 45:48.600
-You would?
-Yeah, I'd love it.

45:49.200 --> 45:50.600
You'd like to be
grabbed like that?

45:58.800 --> 46:00.600
You'd like to be held
like that, huh?

48:18.300 --> 48:19.700
I'll call you this week.

48:22.100 --> 48:24.100
No. Tomorrow.

48:41.500 --> 48:44.000
Hey, look. Look, man. Webster.

48:46.300 --> 48:47.500
Come on.

48:58.600 --> 49:00.600
There he is! Get him!

49:01.800 --> 49:03.900
Come on! Don't let him get away.

49:07.100 --> 49:08.300
Oh, shit.

49:54.600 --> 49:56.200
Go!

50:15.100 --> 50:18.500
Come on!
Run him over to the side!

50:28.800 --> 50:30.100
Good job, man.

50:43.600 --> 50:44.700
Hurry up!

50:59.000 --> 51:00.300
Just hang on.

51:20.600 --> 51:21.800
Come on!

51:28.100 --> 51:30.500
Follow that bus. Go!
Move this rice burner! Go!

51:31.700 --> 51:34.000
Will you let me in the door?
Hey, driver!

51:34.000 --> 51:38.500
Driver, hey, open the door!

51:52.800 --> 51:54.500
Seventy-five cents.

52:06.100 --> 52:07.300
Where is he?

52:08.500 --> 52:09.800
Come on.

52:14.300 --> 52:17.600
Hey, I said seventy-five cents.

52:34.800 --> 52:37.700
-What happened to him?
-I guess he got away.

52:37.700 --> 52:39.600
I know where their ramp is.

53:10.400 --> 53:11.700
Come on! Yeah!

53:40.100 --> 53:41.900
Look at that thing!
Whoa! Come on!

53:42.000 --> 53:42.900
Look at it burn!

54:10.500 --> 54:11.700
Come on. Let's go.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.500
Daggers!
I'm going to get Monk.

54:58.100 --> 54:59.800
I'm OK.

55:15.700 --> 55:17.100
Hey, I want to see
Monk out here...

55:17.100 --> 55:18.800
and I want to see him right now!

55:18.900 --> 55:20.000
Come on out here, Monk!

55:20.100 --> 55:22.300
Stay back, Radley. This is mine.

55:25.200 --> 55:27.800
-Hey! Good morning!
-Yeah, I want to see Monk.

55:27.800 --> 55:29.700
Hey, if it isn't
the Ramp Locals.

55:29.700 --> 55:33.000
Hey, Monk, you got
some guests out here.

55:34.100 --> 55:36.200
What's the commotion?

55:36.300 --> 55:39.300
Oh, it's the Ramp Locals.

55:39.400 --> 55:40.400
It's Monk the punk!

55:40.400 --> 55:42.400
Hey, why don't you
come off the porch, man?

55:42.500 --> 55:45.200
-How's the ramp, you guys?
-Yeah. Come down here!

55:45.300 --> 55:48.200
Check this guy out.

55:48.300 --> 55:49.300
Kick his ass, Monk.

55:49.400 --> 55:52.500
This is gonna be funny.
Watch this.

55:52.500 --> 55:55.000
Hey, man, I want
money for my ramp!

55:55.000 --> 55:56.800
Money? How much?

55:56.900 --> 55:58.100
This enough?

56:01.200 --> 56:02.500
Hey, man.

56:04.800 --> 56:06.900
Come on, Monk, kick his butt.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.400
Oh, man.

56:08.400 --> 56:09.400
Look out. Hey!

56:13.300 --> 56:14.200
All right!

56:17.600 --> 56:18.900
Ah, he's trying to--

56:18.900 --> 56:20.700
he's trying to get up.
Come on!

56:20.800 --> 56:23.000
You liked that, didn't you?
Yes, you did.

56:23.100 --> 56:25.300
You're not coming
around here no more, are you?

56:25.300 --> 56:28.100
Coming around here again?
No. No, you're not.

56:29.600 --> 56:30.900
Your fight's with me, Hook.

56:32.000 --> 56:33.700
Come on!

56:33.700 --> 56:34.900
Get out of the way.

56:35.000 --> 56:36.600
-Let's go.
-Tommy, stop it.

56:36.700 --> 56:39.400
Come on! All right.
All right. Hey!

56:39.400 --> 56:41.800
It's just a game,
right, Valley Boy?

56:41.800 --> 56:43.500
You like games,
right, Valley Boy?

56:43.600 --> 56:44.600
He loves games.

56:44.600 --> 56:46.500
Tonight, meet me at
Bronson Canyon Halfpipe.

56:46.500 --> 56:48.800
9:00. Joust.

56:48.800 --> 56:49.800
Be there.

56:49.800 --> 56:53.200
-No, YOU be there!
-You shut up, you little punk.

56:53.300 --> 56:56.000
-Take your friend out of here.
-Big bad Dagger.

56:56.100 --> 56:57.800
Go back to the Valley, man.

56:57.800 --> 56:59.300
How's your lip feel, buddy?

56:59.300 --> 57:01.600
Come on.
My cereal's getting wet.

57:01.600 --> 57:02.800
Hey, where do you think
you're going?

57:02.800 --> 57:04.800
Don't, Tommy!

57:06.800 --> 57:08.100
Damn!

57:08.500 --> 57:09.500
Get your hands off me.

57:09.500 --> 57:11.600
Corey, whatever this fight
thing is about tonight...

57:11.600 --> 57:12.600
you can't do it.

57:12.600 --> 57:14.600
You think it's a little late
for that now, Chrissy?

57:14.600 --> 57:17.200
Why? Corey, you have nothing
to prove to them.

57:17.300 --> 57:18.500
If you do it...

57:18.600 --> 57:20.900
you're not gonna be any better
than Tommy and his friends.

57:20.900 --> 57:23.200
Chrissy, I'm going, OK?

57:24.500 --> 57:27.700
But the downhill
is only three days away.

57:27.700 --> 57:31.700
Corey, if you get hurt, just
forget about pro sponsorship.

57:31.700 --> 57:33.600
Did you ever think your brother
might get hurt?

57:33.600 --> 57:35.300
Think about it.

57:35.300 --> 57:37.700
I don't want either one of you
getting hurt, Corey.

57:42.300 --> 57:45.700
Corey, please don't go.
Please don't do it.

57:48.900 --> 57:51.600
-Think fast, bro.
-I got it.

57:51.700 --> 57:54.200
-I'm gonna cream that mother.
-I know, man.

57:54.300 --> 57:56.300
Tonight we're gonna joust.
Tonight, man.

57:57.600 --> 58:00.400
-Those boys are out.
-I'm psyched!

58:00.400 --> 58:01.500
Tommy, can I talk to you?

58:02.500 --> 58:03.400
Tonight, man!

58:03.500 --> 58:04.900
Tommy. Tommy,
what is this joust?

58:05.000 --> 58:07.800
-Not now, OK, Chrissy?
-Yes, now!

58:07.800 --> 58:09.600
What are you gonna do to him?

58:09.700 --> 58:11.800
I told you before
to stay out of this.

58:11.800 --> 58:14.400
I could have creamed
that mother out there...

58:14.400 --> 58:16.000
but I'm giving him
a fair chance.

58:17.700 --> 58:19.000
Let's go, man.

58:28.400 --> 58:29.400
Velvet.

58:29.400 --> 58:30.700
Velvet, what is this jousting?

58:30.800 --> 58:32.900
What are they
gonna do to him?

58:33.000 --> 58:34.300
The joust is just a game...

58:34.300 --> 58:36.300
the boys are gonna
play tonight, Chrissy.

58:36.300 --> 58:37.300
Don't worry.

58:37.300 --> 58:39.300
Velvet, it's not a game.
I know it's not.

58:39.400 --> 58:41.900
Are they gonna hurt him?
Is Corey gonna get hurt?

58:41.900 --> 58:45.400
Hey! That's your brother, OK?

58:45.400 --> 58:47.400
And this guy comes over here...

58:47.500 --> 58:50.500
and he tries to start a fight
with your brother.

58:50.500 --> 58:53.500
You'd better learn
who you're with, Chrissy.

58:53.600 --> 58:56.800
I mean, are you with us,
or are you against us?

58:56.900 --> 58:58.700
You figure that out.

01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:57.500
Come on, Corey.

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:03.600
Skate!

01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Let's go!

01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.500
-Come on, wake up. It's a bust!
-Hey, he ain't moving, Radley.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.800
Look out! Get up, bud.

01:04:32.900 --> 01:04:34.300
-Come on!
-My arm!

01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.700
His arm--it's broke, man.

01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.400
Hi.

01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.200
I brought you a new friend.

01:05:03.200 --> 01:05:06.100
I think I've had enough new
friends for a while, Chrissy.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:08.800
You know?

01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:14.100
Corey, I'm really sorry
about what happened last night.

01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.700
Chrissy, don't
worry about it, OK?

01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.700
I don't want
to talk about it.

01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:22.300
I feel that I should
be alone for a while, you know?

01:05:22.300 --> 01:05:25.400
Maybe I'll go back home.
I don't know.

01:05:26.600 --> 01:05:30.000
Yeah. I kind of
know how you feel.

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.300
I've been thinking maybe
I should go home, too.

01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:36.900
By "home," Corey, I mean "home"
as in lndiana home...

01:05:36.900 --> 01:05:38.100
and never coming back.

01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:40.800
Yeah? Well...

01:05:41.900 --> 01:05:43.600
No way you can do
the downhill on Saturday?

01:05:43.600 --> 01:05:46.800
Chrissy, look at my arm.
It's broken.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.300
How do you expect me
to do a downhill with this, huh?

01:05:52.300 --> 01:05:54.200
Why can't you just
use your good arm?

01:05:54.200 --> 01:05:57.200
Jeez. I--I could.

01:05:57.300 --> 01:05:59.500
Yeah, I could, and you want to
know what would happen?

01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:03.600
That is what would happen.
That is me.

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:04.700
You're the one
who wanted to do the joust...

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.700
in the first place, Corey.

01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.200
And you're the one who wasn't
there after I got hurt.

01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:11.200
Monk pulled me away.
I tried to get to you.

01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:13.100
Sure, Chrissy. Sure.

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:14.400
Wait a minute.

01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:16.300
You didn't have
to fight him, you know.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:17.800
You screwed up.

01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.600
But you had to go up
against my brother...

01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.100
didn't you, Corey?

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.700
Don't blame me
for your broken arm.

01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:25.900
You did that to yourself. Later.

01:06:42.300 --> 01:06:44.300
Come on!

01:07:06.100 --> 01:07:09.200
Hey, Chrissy,
you just missed my show.

01:07:09.200 --> 01:07:11.100
I didn't know it ever stopped.

01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.300
Hey. What happened?

01:07:18.300 --> 01:07:19.500
Velvet, if you could take me
to the bus station...

01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:21.800
in the morning,
I'd really appreciate it.

01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:22.900
Where do you think you're going?

01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.200
Home.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.200
You're not going anywhere.
You're staying right here.

01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:28.600
Tommy, I'm going.
That's what you wanted, right?

01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:31.300
-lt was just a game.
-Yeah, just a game.

01:07:31.300 --> 01:07:34.400
My friend's lying
with a broken arm right now.

01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:35.800
He's lost everything
he's worked for...

01:07:35.900 --> 01:07:38.000
just so you could have fun
playing your game.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.400
What's the matter with you?
Can't you take a joke?

01:07:43.100 --> 01:07:44.700
I can't take you.

01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:09.700
What do you want me to do?
Kid sisters, huh?

01:08:16.899 --> 01:08:18.899
I don't need any help, OK?

01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:24.000
This damn lock.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.200
Hey, I've got
an elastic cord in my trunk...

01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:28.200
that'll keep that thing shut.

01:08:28.200 --> 01:08:29.700
You can have it.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.300
Are you OK?

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:40.000
I just shouldn't
have come here.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:48.899
I mean, anytime
I talk to somebody...

01:08:48.899 --> 01:08:51.399
it seems like it ends up
in an argument.

01:08:56.700 --> 01:08:59.100
Your brother doesn't
mean to hurt you.

01:08:59.100 --> 01:09:02.100
Doesn't matter. He's been
that way since we were kids.

01:09:04.899 --> 01:09:07.600
Hey, you sure you
don't want to stay?

01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:10.300
Come on, come to
the downhill with us.

01:09:10.300 --> 01:09:13.600
Your friend Corey
will probably be there.

01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:15.200
Don't you want
to see him again?

01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:17.500
I do...

01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.399
but he doesn't
want to see me.

01:09:22.399 --> 01:09:26.300
I just want to go home
as soon as possible.

01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:28.600
You understand, don't you?

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:30.000
Yeah.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:31.700
Thanks, Velvet.

01:09:43.399 --> 01:09:46.200
-Hi.
-I need to talk to Chrissy.

01:09:46.200 --> 01:09:48.600
-You're Corey, right?
-Yeah.

01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:51.700
God, Corey, that's too bad.
You just missed her.

01:09:51.800 --> 01:09:53.300
What do you mean,
I just missed her?

01:09:53.399 --> 01:09:55.300
I just took her
to the bus station.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.600
She's on her way
back to lndiana.

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:04.300
You know, Corey, she really
liked you a lot.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:06.500
What did you do to her?

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.400
She came back here
crying hysterically...

01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:12.100
saying you were
screaming at her.

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:15.700
Listen. Do you have
her number back in lndiana?

01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:18.300
-Because I got to call her.
-I haven't got it.

01:10:19.500 --> 01:10:21.700
Good-bye, Corey.

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:49.000
-Hey, forget about her.
-She went back to lndiana.

01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.700
-Oh, boo-hoo.
-So forget it.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:54.800
Yeah. You got us, Corey.

01:10:54.900 --> 01:10:58.600
Thanks, Boze.
Thanks a lot.

01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:02.800
Yeah, man.
She...caused this.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.200
Get it? You're the king, bud.

01:11:06.300 --> 01:11:09.900
Just...man, just forget her.

01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.800
She ruined it for everybody.

01:11:11.800 --> 01:11:12.800
You were supposed
to come down here.

01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.800
We were gonna rule L.A.
Now you can't even c--

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:18.200
Hey. Stevie.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.700
Hey, you'll get him
next season, Corey.

01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:22.400
No way, man.
I'll get him now.

01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.800
You're gonna do
the L.A. Massacre, bud?

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:28.700
That's right, the Massacre.
I'm gonna win this race, guys.

01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:31.300
Then I'm gonna get you money
for a new ramp, you know?

01:11:31.300 --> 01:11:33.300
Well, all right.

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.900
All right, Corey.
All right.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.500
Tommy, why isn't Velvet
taking me to the bus station?

01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:40.200
Because I'm your brother,
so I'm taking you.

01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:43.900
What?

01:11:45.700 --> 01:11:49.100
I hope you understand that, uh,
I was only looking out for you.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.300
Yeah?

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:55.500
You sure have a funny way
of showing it.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.300
Maybe I don't show it
sometimes, or, uh...

01:11:59.300 --> 01:12:01.500
I don't know how to show it.

01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.400
What?

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:05.700
Sometimes I get
a little crazy...

01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:08.400
when guys come around
and hassle you...

01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:11.300
but it's only because
I care for you.

01:12:11.400 --> 01:12:13.400
I mean, you're my kid sister.

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:19.400
I understand
how you feel...

01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:22.500
but you have to realize I don't
need a bodyguard anymore.

01:12:24.200 --> 01:12:26.700
I'm not a little girl.

01:13:31.600 --> 01:13:32.600
Damn!

01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:48.200
...bus to Chicago
departing in five minutes.

01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:51.200
Connections in Fort Wayne
and lndianapolis.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.000
All passengers please board now.

01:17:14.700 --> 01:17:15.900
T.A., give me
a hand with this, will you?

01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:19.600
Sure. You're gonna scare
the hell out of those guys.

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:22.300
Daggers are gonna
rule the L.A. Massacre.

01:17:22.400 --> 01:17:24.600
The legend lives. Yeah.

01:17:25.700 --> 01:17:27.400
$1,000 to the winner, boys.

01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:31.400
-We're covered for the summer.
-That's right.

01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.400
Daggers!

01:17:38.500 --> 01:17:40.000
I don't know where Webster's at.

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:42.500
Do you think
maybe he didn't show up?

01:17:42.500 --> 01:17:43.500
He'll be here.

01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.800
If I know Webster,
he will be here.

01:17:50.600 --> 01:17:52.900
Maybe Corey went home.

01:17:52.900 --> 01:17:55.800
Hey, Boze, he'll show up, OK?

01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.200
Yeah, buddy.

01:17:57.300 --> 01:17:59.900
He's raw. You know he'll show.
Be a happy camper.

01:17:59.900 --> 01:18:01.100
Yeah, exactly.

01:18:09.400 --> 01:18:10.600
It's our friends.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:25.900
Great. Hand me that shirt.

01:18:33.600 --> 01:18:36.200
Well. Where's your little hero
today, boys?

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.900
He'll be here.

01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:41.800
-Soon enough to kick your ass.
-Don't count on it.

01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.500
The L.A. Massacre will begin
in five minutes.

01:18:44.500 --> 01:18:48.100
All racers, please report
to the start immediately.

01:18:48.100 --> 01:18:49.600
Well, that's us.

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:51.400
Meet you at the top,
nickel necks.

01:18:52.900 --> 01:18:54.800
See you at the bottom, man.

01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.000
Come on, man. Let's win.

01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:03.900
Hey, we'd better go
to the finish line.

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:04.900
Get our place.

01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:06.900
Yeah, look, I'm gonna stay here.
You guys go on.

01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:09.700
-I got to strap up.
-Yeah. Corey will show, buddy.

01:19:09.700 --> 01:19:13.100
You go out there and kick ass.
Good luck.

01:19:13.100 --> 01:19:14.500
All right, Radley.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.700
-Good luck, partner.
-Thanks, Boze.

01:19:16.800 --> 01:19:18.000
Hey, there's Corey.

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.000
About time, Webster!

01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:25.100
-I knew he'd show.
-Mr. Reliable.

01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.800
Well, holy shit, Webster.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:29.400
I thought you
weren't gonna make it.

01:19:29.500 --> 01:19:31.400
I still may not,
but I'm gonna get Hook.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:32.500
-You ready?
-Let's get out.

01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:34.800
We got a race.

01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:37.100
Take it to them.

01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.100
Boy, I hope they waste Hook.

01:19:39.200 --> 01:19:42.200
Yeah, well, I hope the mountain
doesn't waste them.

01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:46.000
Welcome, race fans.
This is Kenny Taylor...

01:19:46.100 --> 01:19:48.400
high above our 20-mile course
in our official helicopter...

01:19:48.400 --> 01:19:50.200
bringing you race coverage...

01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:51.300
of the longest downhill
skateboarding race...

01:19:51.300 --> 01:19:53.600
in the world, the L.A. Massacre.

01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:55.300
Our competitors are
at the top of Tuna Canyon...

01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:56.500
getting their equipment ready...

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:59.400
for the steepest and gnarliest
course on the circuit.

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:02.100
I'm guessing over 100 entries
in this winner-take-all event.

01:20:02.200 --> 01:20:03.600
For those of you
new to downhilling...

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.400
in a word, it's dangerous.

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:06.600
These skaters will be
hitting speeds...

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:10.000
of over sixty miles per hour
on this windy, twisty road.

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.700
Right now, they're in
the pit area, getting ready.

01:20:12.800 --> 01:20:15.100
All right. Tighten it down.

01:20:15.100 --> 01:20:17.600
That's good.

01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:20.500
I'm linked up
with a walkie-talkie...

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.000
to our race officials.

01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:23.700
I understand that they have
just given the first call...

01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:24.700
for our racers to report
to the starting line.

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:27.200
So it won't be long now.

01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.300
From where I am...

01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:29.800
overlooking this long river
of empty roadway...

01:20:29.800 --> 01:20:30.900
it's kind of serene.

01:20:30.900 --> 01:20:32.300
I can see traffic
starting to back up...

01:20:32.300 --> 01:20:34.800
along Pacific Coast Highway
at the finish line.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:36.200
Our course is
completely clear...

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:38.300
and ready for head-to-head
racing.

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.100
Skaters come from all parts
of the country--

01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:41.700
Colorado, Washington state...

01:20:41.700 --> 01:20:43.000
northern California...

01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:44.500
and although there are
some teams...

01:20:44.600 --> 01:20:46.000
it's pretty much
every man for himself.

01:20:46.100 --> 01:20:48.200
Competitors are lining up now
on the starting line...

01:20:48.300 --> 01:20:49.400
and we're just moments away...

01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:52.500
from the official start
of the L.A. Massacre.

01:20:54.300 --> 01:20:55.800
Come on, man, you can do it.

01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:58.700
Hey, Webster.

01:21:05.600 --> 01:21:07.500
Racers are set.

01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:15.600
And they're off!

01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:33.900
All right. I'm coming after you.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.500
Hey, get out of the way!

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:58.000
Coming through!

01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:05.600
Come on!

01:22:11.100 --> 01:22:12.600
Hey, come on, man.

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:19.600
Look out! Look out!

01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:16.900
On the right.

01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000
-Come in!
-On your left.

01:23:28.400 --> 01:23:30.800
Go! Go! Go!

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.500
-Come on, man.
-Come on!

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:53.000
They're coming for you.

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:31.900
And it's Webster all along...

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:34.800
our new champion
of the L.A. Massacre.

01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.100
Unreal! Our prize money, bud--
one thousand frogskins!

01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:48.800
Yeah, right, man,
we got our ramp back.

01:27:48.800 --> 01:27:52.000
Yeah! We smashed those Daggers!
The Ramp Locals rule!

01:27:54.200 --> 01:27:55.600
We did it!

01:27:58.500 --> 01:28:02.600
-Hey, Corey, congratulations.
-Thanks a lot, Mr. Flood.

01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:04.700
Hey, welcome
to Smash Skates, kid.

01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:08.800
I made it! I did it!

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:21.700
I don't believe it.
How did you get back?

01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:24.600
-Don't ask.
-Oh, my God.

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:26.300
Hey, Webster.

01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:29.400
Man, that was insane.

01:28:30.800 --> 01:28:33.200
Chrissy, I'm really glad
to see you're back.

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:36.400
Your boyfriend here
is a lunatic.

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:41.100
Good race.

01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.300
All right.

01:28:44.305 --> 01:28:50.177
