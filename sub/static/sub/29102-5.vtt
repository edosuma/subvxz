WEBVTT

01:52.529 --> 01:53.404
I'm sorry.

02:01.037 --> 02:01.996
Where's Blanca?

02:03.289 --> 02:07.085
They took her.
Also Karla and some of the Venezuelans.

02:07.168 --> 02:10.296
When?
-While you were in the shower.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.382
They like to do it in the morning,

02:12.465 --> 02:15.802
or in the middle of the night
while people are groggy.

02:15.885 --> 02:16.845
Less resistance this way.

02:16.928 --> 02:18.805
Where did they take her?
Is she coming back?

02:20.598 --> 02:21.808
Probably.

02:25.895 --> 02:28.857
Oh, God! What is that smell?

02:29.190 --> 02:31.818
It's a combination
of naturally derived stain remover

02:31.901 --> 02:34.988
and breast milk derived infant feces.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.532
It's layered.

02:37.615 --> 02:38.825
Looking a little rough there.

02:38.908 --> 02:41.035
You and the office gals
hit up ladies' night or something?

02:41.119 --> 02:45.498
I drank their entire bottle of tequila
and ate their cookie cake with my hands.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.334
The cougars are gonna eat me alive today.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.005
I wish there was a way
that I could call in sick.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.048
I thought you were liking the new gig?

02:54.132 --> 02:57.051
How could anyone like
standing in front of a scanner

02:57.135 --> 03:01.806
for eight hours a day,
trying not to throw out broken pens?

03:01.890 --> 03:03.057
You wanna switch places with me?

03:03.141 --> 03:05.518
'Cause Neri's got me assigned
this shit-scraping duty

03:05.602 --> 03:07.312
while she visits her mom with the baby.

03:07.395 --> 03:11.065
And then I have to launder these
at the world's worst laundromat ever,

03:11.149 --> 03:14.652
where, the last time, I had to clean
broccoli florets out of the machine

03:14.736 --> 03:15.653
before I could load in.

03:15.737 --> 03:19.407
And then I'm trapped here waiting
for the fridge repairman to arrive

03:19.490 --> 03:22.285
somewhere between the hours
of 11:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.

03:22.368 --> 03:26.998
I guess I love the little fucker,
but being a dad is a real life-ruiner.

03:27.081 --> 03:28.249
So is going to prison.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.794
Even after you serve your time,
they still find ways to punish you.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.881
Okay, I'm calling time-out
on this whole misery Olympics.

03:34.964 --> 03:37.634
We both win.
Maybe we need to start meditating.

03:37.717 --> 03:39.093
What I need is a break.

03:39.385 --> 03:42.931
I need a day off from all the rules.
Like a little personal snow day.

03:43.014 --> 03:44.766
Man, I loved snow days.

03:44.849 --> 03:48.019
Remember how we used to watch
<i>Price Is Right</i> marathons in our PJs,

03:48.102 --> 03:49.687
even though I

03:49.771 --> 03:53.107
And make grilled cheeses, and drink
Marshmallow Lovers' hot chocolate?

03:53.191 --> 03:55.902
-Oh.
-Which is a disgusting combination.

03:55.985 --> 03:57.820
Who knew it'd be all downhill from there?

03:58.446 --> 03:59.364
But does it have to be?

03:59.447 --> 04:01.908
Just because we're adults
doesn't mean we can't have a snow day.

04:01.991 --> 04:04.702
Except that it does,
because you're on parole,

04:04.786 --> 04:07.747
I have an infant, and it's not snowing.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.165
Ugh!

04:09.249 --> 04:13.586
Oh, we've both been so good.
We deserve one day of hooky.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.796
Uh...

04:14.879 --> 04:17.507
Then we can go back to our shitty,
oppressive lives.

04:17.590 --> 04:22.262
You write a note for the fridge guy,
and I'll figure out a way to get off work.

04:22.345 --> 04:23.763
Well, that part's easy.

04:23.846 --> 04:25.181
You just call the office phone,

04:25.265 --> 04:27.767
leave a message on the machine
saying that your snot is green.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.852
I used to do it all the time
when I had that job.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.730
-Mmm... I don't know.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.734
Neri has been strictly hand jobs
since the baby.

04:36.818 --> 04:40.321
I can't risk losing those.
Her hands are so soft.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.825
Cal, come on. It's one day.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.412
-I--
-It's one day, for our sanity.

04:47.495 --> 04:52.125
When was the last time
that you and I had fun together?

04:55.336 --> 04:57.213
I mean, a few skid marks
won't kill the kid,

04:57.297 --> 04:58.506
-Ah!

04:59.007 --> 05:00.591
Hair of the dog.

05:01.926 --> 05:03.636
-Yes!

05:04.429 --> 05:07.098
-Fuck the police.

05:12.020 --> 05:13.396
You girls have fun.

05:14.272 --> 05:16.733
Make sure to get yourself
something nice, too, Mama.

05:16.816 --> 05:20.236
Maybe, uh, one of them leopard numbers
I like, you know?

05:25.033 --> 05:26.117
Leopard ain't cheap.

05:27.618 --> 05:29.078
Well, business is boomin'.

05:30.621 --> 05:32.415
I mean, you can try some stuff on.

05:32.498 --> 05:36.336
I can sit in one of those husband chairs,
and you can, like, model it for me?

05:37.337 --> 05:39.213
Those chairs are for pussies and perverts.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.298
All right.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.927
That's a fair point. All right,
I'm gonna let you girls do your thing.

05:45.011 --> 05:46.012
I'm gonna go to Sbarro

05:46.095 --> 05:48.890
and get something to eat
and then head into the office.

05:49.682 --> 05:52.435
Okay.  Bye, guys. Have fun.

05:55.938 --> 05:58.024
Sale rack only. Nothing too slutty.

05:58.107 --> 06:00.568
Yeah, yeah.
Do as you say, not as you slut.

06:02.653 --> 06:04.155
He's gonna figure out
you're stealing from him.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.324
I'm not stealing. It's business.

06:06.407 --> 06:09.535
Is that why your tampon box
is full of cash and no tampons?

06:09.619 --> 06:12.789
Stay the fuck out of my tampon box.
I know exactly how much is in there.

06:12.872 --> 06:14.499
Plus, I earned that money.

06:14.582 --> 06:17.794
Here, go get yourself a shirt
that actually covers your tits.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.380
Oh, so I have to wait till I'm old
to show them off like you do?

06:20.463 --> 06:25.885
Hey! I am a young 37-year-old,
and you wish you had my tit gene.

06:25.968 --> 06:29.806
You got those Gonzales tube sock boobs,
like your grandmother.

06:30.681 --> 06:33.101
Hey, babe. We gotta go.
I parked in the handicap.

06:33.184 --> 06:34.560
Hey. Who's this?

06:34.644 --> 06:36.354
Angel. My boyfriend.

06:38.689 --> 06:40.316
This is the guy you been seeing?

06:41.150 --> 06:43.236
What is he, like, twice your age?

06:43.319 --> 06:44.153
So?

06:45.655 --> 06:47.323
So he's a fucking pedophile.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.784
Damn. Your mom's a savage.

06:49.867 --> 06:51.369
Hey! She's only 13.

06:51.452 --> 06:52.578
You come near my daughter again,

06:52.662 --> 06:55.706
I will rip your balls off
and shove 'em down your throat.

06:56.040 --> 06:59.085
Now get the fuck out of here
before I violate my parole.

06:59.460 --> 07:01.379
-Okay, <i>mami.</i>

07:01.462 --> 07:04.090
-You ain't texting shit!

07:04.173 --> 07:05.925
Hanging out with some
grown-ass drug dealer,

07:06.008 --> 07:08.803
like you some jailbait gangbanger.

07:09.512 --> 07:12.598
You will never see him again, you hear me?

07:12.682 --> 07:14.434
It's none of your business who I see.

07:16.477 --> 07:18.354
I know that you think you're grown

07:18.438 --> 07:20.314
because you have
some short and curlies now,

07:20.398 --> 07:23.025
but messing with some scumbag like that

07:23.109 --> 07:27.071
will ruin your whole life for good
before you even get into high school.

07:27.405 --> 07:30.491
-Believe me, 'cause I know.
I can't even date?

07:30.575 --> 07:33.828
I didn't say that. You wanna get felt up
in the back of a McDonald's?

07:33.911 --> 07:36.330
Go right ahead.
But do it with someone your own age.

07:36.414 --> 07:37.790
Guys my age are boring.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.460
Older guys are boring, too. Trust me.

07:40.543 --> 07:42.336
Whatever, yo.

07:43.379 --> 07:45.673
Yo, where are you going?

07:46.132 --> 07:47.550
Don't you walk away from me!

07:48.676 --> 07:49.677
Eva!

07:51.304 --> 07:52.555
See him over there?

07:53.556 --> 07:58.478
You're gonna go over to him,
and smile and introduce yourself,

07:58.561 --> 08:01.731
and then gonna ask him
if he wants to dance.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.024
The Freddy Krueger

08:03.107 --> 08:06.652
It don't matter what he looks like.
He's a good tipper.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.321
Why can't you go?

08:08.404 --> 08:11.616
Because I'm not as young
and beautiful as you are.

08:13.326 --> 08:17.205
But the last guy kept pinching me.
And his breath smelled like dog treats.

08:17.288 --> 08:20.833
If he wants to pinch you,
let him pinch you.

08:21.167 --> 08:26.380
But if he wants to do anything else,
you tell him it's more money, understand?

08:28.925 --> 08:32.386
Hey, Aleida, look at me.

08:33.137 --> 08:34.972
I know things are bad right now.

08:35.056 --> 08:36.933
We only gotta hold out a little longer.

08:37.016 --> 08:38.684
Your daddy's getting out soon.

08:38.768 --> 08:41.604
And once he's out,
we won't have to do this no more.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.523
We... ain't doing anything.

08:44.607 --> 08:47.109
And the last time Daddy got out,
he gambled away everything we had

08:47.193 --> 08:49.487
-and was back in jail three weeks later.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.572
-No, but--
-I didn't think so.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.243
Now, stop complaining
and get rid of the mopey face.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.662
Gotta smile. Let me see.

08:59.163 --> 09:02.542
Good. Now be a big girl
and go talk to him.

09:02.625 --> 09:06.045
And be nice and laugh,
and blink your eyes a lot.

09:13.469 --> 09:16.806
-Aleida.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.934
Aleida. That's a beautiful name.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.019
You're very pretty, Aleida.

09:22.103 --> 09:23.396
Yeah. You wanna dance or what?

09:49.964 --> 09:53.301
Oh, shit! Oh, man. I'm sorry.

09:53.384 --> 09:57.013
Flaca, Lorna, Nicky.
Help me clean this mess up.

09:57.096 --> 09:58.431
But we're doing the salad.

09:58.514 --> 10:00.349
Well, salad is a strong word
for what we're doing.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.977
Well, I guess lunch
is gonna be late, then.

10:03.060 --> 10:04.520
I'm sorry, but lunch can't be late.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.939
When women don't eat, they get crazy.
It's a safety risk.

10:07.023 --> 10:11.485
If you want lunch to be served on time,
then I'm gonna need extra help.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.279
Have you eaten today?
Maybe you should have a snack.

10:13.362 --> 10:15.823
Look, I'm telling you.
What's that other CO's name

10:15.906 --> 10:17.825
-She let detainees come and help.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.494
Yeah. And even then
we barely made it on time. Okay, fine.
I'll, uh, get you a couple of volunteers.

10:23.247 --> 10:24.498
-Yeah, thank you.

10:24.582 --> 10:29.337
Uh, you should probably get
Maritza Ramos, uh, Blanca Flores,

10:29.420 --> 10:30.963
because they used to work with me
down at the camp.

10:31.047 --> 10:31.922
They know what they're doing.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.966
Our lives would be a lot easier,
I promise.

10:34.050 --> 10:38.262
All right. I'll see if I can find them.
And you should really eat something.

10:40.264 --> 10:41.849
It's because you're distracted.

10:41.932 --> 10:43.809
When you're distracted,
you have accidents.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.519
It wasn't an accident.
I need to get them in here.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.271
I need to talk to them. It's important.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.939
More important than doing your job?

10:49.023 --> 10:52.360
Have you been paying attention?
Ramos and Flores need help.

10:54.445 --> 10:55.655
You feeling okay?

10:55.738 --> 10:59.492
Yes, I'm fine. I'm not the one
throwing things on the floor.

11:03.412 --> 11:04.413
Where is Flores?

11:04.497 --> 11:05.539
I'm not sure, to be honest.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.958
But this one says
she worked in Luxor as a chef.

11:08.042 --> 11:11.295
Vinnie says that Caesars is still
the best hotel in Vegas.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.713
Luxor is in Egypt.

11:13.297 --> 11:17.218
Right. The pyramid with the big light.
Right next to Excalibur's?

11:17.301 --> 11:20.680
I'm-- I'm sorry about my friend.
She's a little slow on the uptake.

11:20.763 --> 11:23.724
Uh, it takes her two hours
to watch <i>60 Minutes.</i>

11:23.808 --> 11:26.102
-Okay, back to work, ladies.

11:27.144 --> 11:28.104
Okay.

11:29.355 --> 11:31.107
-They took Blanca.

11:31.190 --> 11:33.526
-The fucking terminators.
-Shh. Not here.

11:34.318 --> 11:37.530
Uh, Ramos, Gonzales,
why don't you guys help me

11:37.613 --> 11:40.032
take some stuff out from the freezer
while they clean up?

11:40.116 --> 11:42.868
Uh, Red, why don't you
watch the stew for me?

11:42.952 --> 11:44.412
Don't forget to add salt and pepper.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.497
I know how to season a stew.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.878
-She disappeared. This morning.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.505
I got back from the bathroom,
and she was gone.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.549
They Chris Angel-ed her ass
back to the DR?

11:56.632 --> 12:01.512
I don't know. My bunkie said
it means she was at her hearing

12:01.595 --> 12:03.514
or got transferred or, yeah, deported.

12:04.515 --> 12:08.561
But they haven't given away her bed yet,
which she said might mean the first one.

12:09.103 --> 12:12.231
Oh, my God. I-- I got the feeling
that she was just trying to be nice.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.774
Or maybe-- maybe it's true.

12:13.858 --> 12:17.194
Even if it is, that means that she went
to the hearing without a lawyer.

12:17.278 --> 12:20.197
No--

12:20.281 --> 12:21.407
No, I don't have a lawyer.

12:21.490 --> 12:23.868
You will. I wanted to tell you.
I found this group online.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.829
It's called Freedom for Immigrants,
and they wanna help people in here.

12:26.912 --> 12:29.457
Yeah, and I called them
and I told them all about you.

12:29.540 --> 12:31.041
How cute and fly you are,

12:31.125 --> 12:32.960
and how you're basically like
the next Kylie Jenner,

12:33.043 --> 12:35.796
and they have to save you.
So they have this number to call,

12:35.880 --> 12:39.133
so you can get a lawyer,
a free lawyer, to come talk to you.

12:39.800 --> 12:42.636
Okay, but it's not a 1
'Cause those don't work here, trust.

12:42.720 --> 12:46.682
No, no, no. Alls you do is hit pound
and put these four numbers in,

12:47.057 --> 12:49.435
and that's it, it connects.
Just like a hotline.

12:49.977 --> 12:53.355
"9-4-8-1."
Girl, that's Beyoncé's birthday!

12:53.439 --> 12:55.024
Does that mean she's watching over me?

12:55.107 --> 12:56.108
-That's what I said.

12:56.192 --> 12:58.486
Okay, but you have to be careful, though.
Okay?

12:59.069 --> 13:02.406
Apparently, if they figure out
that you're using the hotline,

13:02.490 --> 13:03.824
Big Brother shuts it down.

13:05.117 --> 13:07.119
Don't worry,
I had a thing with a senator once.

13:07.203 --> 13:10.331
I know how to be discreet.
You guys, thank you so much.

13:10.414 --> 13:11.791
Which senator?

13:12.541 --> 13:15.377
Bitch, like you know about senators.

13:25.429 --> 13:28.182
Thanks, CO Dixon. Come in.

13:29.058 --> 13:30.017
You can leave us.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.686
I think I'll wait outside
in case she gets violent again.

13:32.770 --> 13:33.854
Appreciate it.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.441
Have a seat.

13:40.277 --> 13:43.906
-Thank you for letting me talk to you.
-It's my job.

13:45.241 --> 13:48.702
-Yeah, I know you're busy.
-Yeah, I am, actually.

13:49.829 --> 13:51.956
So, what did you wanna talk about?

13:53.374 --> 13:57.211
Well, I was looking at those pamphlets
that you had gave everybody.

13:57.294 --> 13:58.796
And they really got me thinking.

13:59.129 --> 14:01.215
-Oh, no.

14:01.298 --> 14:02.716
None of them really seem right for me.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.845
But they got me thinking about
how I wanna spend my time here.

14:06.178 --> 14:12.476
And I was thinking maybe I could do, like,
an independent study situation with you?

14:13.185 --> 14:14.353
As your assistant?

14:16.146 --> 14:17.189
My assistant?

14:17.273 --> 14:19.733
Yeah, I used to do it for Mr. Caputo,
back when he was the warden.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.695
I mean, I would, you know,
cover the phone,

14:22.778 --> 14:24.947
file paperwork, give him reminders. I would tell people, you know,
he was on a call,

14:27.283 --> 14:30.536
maybe when he was beating his meat
or something. You know, office-y shit.

14:30.619 --> 14:33.622
And then we had a really nice groove
towards the end.

14:33.706 --> 14:37.418
-And he said that I was very helpful.
-Not gonna lie. I could use the help.

14:37.501 --> 14:40.921
And I could use the money
and the mental stimulation,

14:41.005 --> 14:45.926
and a break from
these squawking bitches in here.

14:46.677 --> 14:49.388
It sounds nice and all,

14:50.931 --> 14:54.018
but I can't have the COs thinking
I'm doing you any favors.

14:54.351 --> 14:55.311
They already think that.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.480
Ain't you the boss?
Since when you care what people think?

14:59.565 --> 15:01.275
Where's this coming from, Taystee?

15:02.902 --> 15:07.531
Last time I checked, you were all,
"Get out of my room, Mom."

15:07.615 --> 15:11.243
I-- I thought about what you said,
and you were right.

15:11.327 --> 15:15.331
I can't sit around being pissed off
for the rest of my life.

15:16.123 --> 15:19.084
I gotta figure out
how I'm gonna make it easier in here.

15:19.668 --> 15:24.548
I gotta figure out a way
to make it... livable.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.136
Otherwise, I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.

15:30.971 --> 15:33.265
Oh. I'm sorry. I see you're busy.

15:33.349 --> 15:37.061
Officer Hopper, how do I make it clear
to you that you need to knock first?

15:37.144 --> 15:39.647
I thought you'd like to know
that there's been another incident,

15:40.022 --> 15:43.400
but I'd hate to interrupt your girl talk,
so I'll come back later.

15:43.484 --> 15:47.905
Actually, why don't you go ahead and
schedule some time with my new assistant?

16:02.336 --> 16:05.172
Slow down, Pipes.
You gotta save room for the main event.

16:05.255 --> 16:06.632
This beer is delicious.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.842
I think it's probably mostly
the getting-out-of-prison thing. -Oh, my God.

16:14.139 --> 16:16.225
This is an entire meal in a drink.

16:16.308 --> 16:19.144
Told you. Allow me to demonstrate.

16:19.561 --> 16:20.521
Mmm?

16:26.235 --> 16:27.194
Yep.

16:28.195 --> 16:29.947
A lot's changed
since you've been away, Pipes.

16:30.030 --> 16:31.031
Mmm!

16:31.115 --> 16:33.742
People ride around
on bikes sponsored by banks.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.120
The Internet's more important
than real life.

16:36.203 --> 16:39.540
And Bloody Marys now come with Wagyu beef.
Welcome to the future.

16:39.623 --> 16:41.834
The future is amazing.

16:42.793 --> 16:45.796
-I'm so glad we did this.
-Me, too.

16:47.464 --> 16:50.217
You know what would make this
even better, though?

16:50.300 --> 16:53.012
I was saving these
for Neri's fire spinning show,

16:53.095 --> 16:55.723
but it's not every day your ex-con sister
has a snow day with you.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.269
What are those?
-They're bloobs.

17:02.146 --> 17:04.565
That's what you call chocolate-covered
blueberries when there's pot in them.

17:04.898 --> 17:05.816
What?

17:07.026 --> 17:11.989
Oh, my God. What I wouldn't give
to get high like a normal person.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.199
Cal, I've been dreaming about it.

17:14.283 --> 17:16.118
Well, I'm offering you
that dream come true.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.454
But I get pee tested.

17:18.537 --> 17:21.665
Oh, please. This is not
my first drug test rodeo.

17:21.749 --> 17:25.002
You squirt a little Visine into the cup.
It makes the test unreadable.

17:25.085 --> 17:27.755
I used to do it all the time
when I worked in that cannery in Alaska.

17:27.838 --> 17:29.256
That doesn't really work, does it?

17:29.339 --> 17:31.759
Piper, I have
a very particular set of skills,

17:31.842 --> 17:34.470
skills acquired over a lifetime
of smoking marijuana,

17:34.553 --> 17:38.807
skills that make me an expert in masking
the presence of weed in my urine.

17:39.725 --> 17:41.894
Do you promise that it won't show up?

17:42.853 --> 17:43.771
I guarantee it.

17:44.897 --> 17:46.982
Come on. You said no rules.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.443
That was the whole point
of snow day, wasn't it?

18:09.296 --> 18:11.340
What's wrong

18:11.590 --> 18:12.674
Funny.

18:12.758 --> 18:14.802
Social media can make you depressed,
you know.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.762
It's called
the compare and despair effect.

18:16.845 --> 18:19.848
Thanks for the tip, but I'm actually
trying to order something.

18:20.474 --> 18:23.977
Believe it or not,
1-800-Flowers does not accept Green Dot.

18:24.561 --> 18:27.731
-Mine are all maxed.

18:27.815 --> 18:30.025
Plus, you're a convicted felon.

18:32.486 --> 18:34.196
What are you trying
to order flowers for, anyway?

18:35.447 --> 18:36.323
Piper.

18:39.201 --> 18:40.828
It's our finger-bang-iversary.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.289
-God, you are naive.

18:45.457 --> 18:49.628
She's been a little down lately,
thanks in no small part to me.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.506
I just want her to know
that I'm thinking about her.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.386
Must be nice to be in a relationship
with a woman.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.389
So much more consideration.

19:00.472 --> 19:03.475
I mean, it cuts both ways.
More consideration, yes.

19:04.601 --> 19:08.730
More passive-aggressive fighting
about unspoken emotions, also, yes.

19:10.732 --> 19:15.112
It sounds like flowers won't cut it, then.
You should do something more personal.

19:16.405 --> 19:18.115
I'll run to the nearest Color Me Mine

19:18.198 --> 19:20.868
and paint her a mug
with an inspirational quote on it.

19:20.951 --> 19:22.202
Maybe something like,

19:22.286 --> 19:24.079
"Everything's a dildo
if you're brave enough."

19:25.289 --> 19:27.749
I see what you mean
about the passive-aggressive thing.

19:28.542 --> 19:30.127
Shit. Wait. Wait. Okay.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.754
You're right.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.465
I thought of something.

19:35.966 --> 19:40.095
How do you feel about making
a long detour on your way home tonight?

19:47.644 --> 19:49.688
I'd love to catch a wave on that.

19:49.771 --> 19:53.442
A tiny little man
on a tiny little surfboard.

19:54.484 --> 19:57.821
We should be able to do that.
Surf on snow.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.617
Isn't that what snowboarding is?

20:02.743 --> 20:03.744
Oh.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.873
I'm gonna try
the goat cheese chili chocolate.

20:07.956 --> 20:12.669
Hi. Excuse me.
Can I try the goat cheese chili chocolate?

20:12.753 --> 20:14.046
You already tried that one.

20:14.129 --> 20:15.714
I've forgotten how it tastes.

20:15.797 --> 20:19.718
And I need to cross-reference it
with the bourbon cornflake.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.652
-Uh-uh.

20:36.735 --> 20:38.070
It's unreal.

20:39.947 --> 20:40.948
Oh, yeah.

20:42.032 --> 20:44.743
I'm high. I'm really high.

20:48.538 --> 20:50.999
How does that Visine thing work again?
Like, physically?

20:51.083 --> 20:53.168
Oh! It's super easy. Um...

20:54.211 --> 20:57.798
You cup the Visine in your hand,
and then when you go to pee,

20:57.881 --> 21:02.511
-you stick it under your dick, like so.

21:02.594 --> 21:03.971
And then when you pee,

21:04.054 --> 21:07.933
you squirt little squirts of Visine
into the cup.

21:08.809 --> 21:12.980
It helps if you're a little chubbed,
so there's some resistance, you know.

21:19.194 --> 21:20.779
But I don't have a cone.

21:20.862 --> 21:23.573
Even better. Then you don't even need
the sleight of hand.

21:23.657 --> 21:27.536
Just pre-load the bottle
and then Kegel it while you pee.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.209
Are you doing it?

21:34.293 --> 21:36.878
I am, yeah.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.630
Yeah, I think I am.

21:44.428 --> 21:47.139
It's a real shame you're not gonna
get to use your chef skills here.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.808
It's not exactly the Four Seasons Cairo.

21:49.891 --> 21:52.311
We don't have four seasons in Cairo.
Only two.

21:52.394 --> 21:56.189
Ah. A Cairo comedienne who cooks.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.567
All lies. I'm not from Cairo.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.110
-I'm hit-and-miss funny.
-Mmm-hmm.

22:00.193 --> 22:02.821
And I lied to the guard
about my cooking skills.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.907
I just wanted something to occupy my mind.

22:05.991 --> 22:08.910
I've been moved around
to many of these detention centers.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.912
They all start to look the same
after a while.

22:10.996 --> 22:11.913
How long is a while?

22:11.997 --> 22:15.459
-For me, it's been 18 months.

22:15.542 --> 22:18.545
It's not like prison.
They don't give you a set release date.

22:18.628 --> 22:21.298
My case will either get approved
for asylum

22:21.381 --> 22:23.300
or they send me back to Egypt.

22:23.383 --> 22:25.218
I won't know until it's happening.

22:25.302 --> 22:26.303
Yeesh.

22:27.179 --> 22:31.183
Well, at least you're getting to see
the best parts of America,

22:31.266 --> 22:34.811
from our fine cuisine
to our wonderful melting pot,

22:34.895 --> 22:36.646
on deck to be deported.

22:36.730 --> 22:39.399
-I only came to America for one thing.

22:39.483 --> 22:40.442
The Tater Tots.

22:40.525 --> 22:44.154
Oh. Well, we are known for our tots.

22:44.237 --> 22:50.744
I love how they are perfectly bite-sized
and way too salty.

22:51.370 --> 22:55.415
Just like the testicles of a food god.
What's in them, anyway?

22:55.499 --> 22:56.333
Pertaters.

22:56.416 --> 23:00.545
Ah. That's how you pronounce it?
Now, I understand the name.

23:03.799 --> 23:05.384
Thanks. I really had to go.

23:06.009 --> 23:07.761
I think there's a bug
going around or somethin'.

23:07.844 --> 23:09.179
I hope
you washed your hands afterwards.

23:09.262 --> 23:11.890
Otherwise, it's gonna be like
World War III in here tomorrow.

23:16.728 --> 23:19.689
You guys, I called the number
and they put me in touch with a lawyer.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.192
She said I actually might have
a good case.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.403
And she wants to meet with me
in a couple days.

23:24.486 --> 23:27.447
-My God!
Beyoncé's got you, girl!

23:27.531 --> 23:30.534
She turn up yet?
-No, not yet.

23:30.617 --> 23:33.328
-Don't worry. Beyoncé will check up on it.
-Yes.

23:33.412 --> 23:35.455
But we have to be patient like the song.

23:35.539 --> 23:37.124
Okay, ladies, come and get it.

23:43.672 --> 23:45.841
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Uh-uh.

23:45.924 --> 23:47.717
Bless us, oh, Lord,

23:47.801 --> 23:52.472
for this stew of despair
we made from expired ingredients.

23:52.931 --> 23:57.894
We pray that it doesn't permanently alter
the species in our gut biome.

23:58.895 --> 23:59.729
Amen.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.357
Ugh.

24:03.650 --> 24:06.945
-Wow. You can really taste the despair.

24:07.362 --> 24:08.530
Mmm.

24:09.614 --> 24:11.950
That's not despair, that's salt.

24:12.576 --> 24:14.744
How much salt did you put in here, Red?

24:17.414 --> 24:19.916
I put in the perfectly correct amount.

24:21.168 --> 24:25.505
Maybe you had already salted it
before you told me to salt it.

24:26.089 --> 24:27.716
No, I don't think I did.

24:29.718 --> 24:31.970
Your one responsibility was the stew.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.557
If there's something wrong with it,
it's on you.

24:39.895 --> 24:41.688
Yeah, no, no. You're right.

24:42.397 --> 24:45.692
Um, I should be paying more attention,
you know.

24:45.775 --> 24:48.612
Today, I've had a million things
on my mind.

24:48.695 --> 24:52.032
It seems I'm the only one who remembers
that we have a job to do here.

24:52.115 --> 24:53.867
These women are suffering.

24:54.534 --> 24:57.621
The least we can do
is put all our bullshit aside for a minute

24:57.704 --> 25:00.290
and give them a decent meal,
for Christ's sake.

25:03.627 --> 25:05.128
On the basis
of the foregoing,

25:05.212 --> 25:08.715
it is charged that you are subject
to removal from the United States

25:08.798 --> 25:13.512
pursuant to Provision 212
of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

25:13.595 --> 25:15.972
-Based on the government's recommendation,

25:16.056 --> 25:19.309
the court will designate Honduras
as the country of removal.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.608
Please don't do this.

25:27.067 --> 25:30.445
My whole life is here.
My family is here.

25:37.118 --> 25:40.205
Am I missing something
or is our team batting zero up there?

25:42.541 --> 25:43.917
I don't want any problems.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.211
I think we already got problems.

25:46.294 --> 25:49.005
The shackles and the crying
are usually a sign of that.

25:49.798 --> 25:51.258
You think this is funny?

25:52.551 --> 25:54.970
Maybe you're used to
this kind of treatment,

25:55.053 --> 25:58.306
but it's because of criminals like you
that I'm even here right now.

25:58.390 --> 25:59.516
Mmm-hmm.

25:59.599 --> 26:01.726
Right. Because criminals vote Republican.

26:03.520 --> 26:06.314
It used to be that honest,

26:06.815 --> 26:12.445
hard-working people like me
could lead productive lives in the States,

26:12.529 --> 26:17.784
minding their own business, contributing,
staying invisible.

26:18.660 --> 26:22.581
But people like you gave them
an excuse to come after all of us.

26:23.373 --> 26:24.749
You don't even know
what I did.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.042
And I don't want to.

26:31.423 --> 26:33.758
All I wanna know is where my kids are.

26:34.301 --> 26:35.468
They took your kids?

26:36.761 --> 26:40.015
519. Córdova, Karla.

26:46.938 --> 26:49.733
To the respondent,
what is your true and complete name?

26:49.816 --> 26:52.777
Karla Diana Adilene Córdova.
Thank you.

26:53.320 --> 26:56.948
Ma'am, I have before me a document
called a "Notice to Appear."

26:57.032 --> 26:59.784
In this document, the Department
of Homeland Security alleges

26:59.868 --> 27:02.912
that you are not a citizen
or national of the United States

27:02.996 --> 27:05.498
and that you entered
the country illegally.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.125
How do you plead to the allegations?

27:07.208 --> 27:09.377
I am denying the allegations.

27:09.461 --> 27:12.839
And the basis for your denial?
Are you a US citizen?

27:12.922 --> 27:16.635
It is the government's burden
to prove what it says in that paper.

27:17.552 --> 27:18.720
I am not saying anything.

27:19.763 --> 27:22.140
Your Honor, we have an I-213
for the respondent,

27:22.223 --> 27:24.684
in which she admits
that she is a citizen of El Salvador.

27:24.768 --> 27:26.186
I object to that document he has!

27:26.269 --> 27:29.564
I haven't seen it,
and I never admitted anything to anyone.

27:30.148 --> 27:33.777
Never mind anything about El Salvador.
I know my rights.

27:33.860 --> 27:38.323
If that is all he has to prove his case,
then you should throw my case out.

27:38.406 --> 27:40.909
Is the government prepared
to meet its burden of proof

27:40.992 --> 27:43.286
in regard
to the defendant's citizenship today?

27:43.370 --> 27:44.245
No, Your Honor.

27:44.913 --> 27:50.835
Your Honor, it is my right to ask
that my case be moved to a later date

27:50.919 --> 27:55.173
so that I might have time
to seek effective legal counsel.

27:58.843 --> 28:03.223
Very well. I will set the matter over
to give you time to try to find a lawyer.

28:03.306 --> 28:05.892
Your new date will be issued to you
within a few days.

28:05.975 --> 28:09.062
-This matter is adjourned for today.
-Thank you, Your Honor.

28:20.990 --> 28:24.035
813. Flores, Blanca.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.715
To the respondent,
what is your true and complete name?

28:36.798 --> 28:38.216
I am denying everything.

28:39.050 --> 28:40.635
You're denying your name?

28:41.219 --> 28:42.220
Oh.

28:43.012 --> 28:45.390
Sorry. Blanca Raiza Flores.

28:46.141 --> 28:49.310
Your Honor,
I would like to reset my case, too,

28:50.395 --> 28:51.813
until I find a lawyer.

28:52.272 --> 28:54.441
It is my right, Your Honor.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.987
Are you just saying that
because she said it?

28:59.070 --> 29:01.948
No. I was gonna say it first.

29:02.031 --> 29:02.907
Do you even know

29:02.991 --> 29:05.160
what the government's charges
against you are?

29:05.243 --> 29:06.745
You can say whatever you want.

29:07.328 --> 29:09.873
I'm not saying anything
until I have a lawyer.

29:12.625 --> 29:13.835
All right, ma'am.

29:13.918 --> 29:16.713
Since you seem determined
to waste the court's time,

29:16.796 --> 29:18.757
I will set the matter over
to a later date,

29:18.840 --> 29:23.052
give you an opportunity to find a lawyer.
Make sure you are prepared next time.

29:23.136 --> 29:25.013
Thank you, Your Honor.

29:25.096 --> 29:28.183
Yes, well, you can thank your friend.
Adjourned.

29:38.818 --> 29:41.279
It smells like ass in this place.
Why'd you make me come here?

29:41.362 --> 29:42.906
To show you what happens to little girls

29:42.989 --> 29:45.617
who think they're grown
and don't listen to their mother. Sit.

29:46.826 --> 29:50.205
Keep acting up, you're gonna be
smelling that ass smell every day.

29:54.083 --> 29:59.506
Is that Eva? Girl, you grew up so fast.
What grade you in

29:59.589 --> 30:02.383
-Eighth.
-Eighth grade. Wow.

30:02.467 --> 30:04.052
Boys must be all over you.

30:04.135 --> 30:06.346
-Yeah, and she's all over them, too.

30:06.429 --> 30:11.059
Wow. I'm so happy you came
to see me, baby. I missed you.

30:11.142 --> 30:13.520
I think about you every day in here.
You know that, right?

30:14.521 --> 30:16.439
Tell her how much it sucks
to be in prison.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.149
How everybody's a lesbian

30:18.233 --> 30:21.986
and how they make you eat that brown,
mushy stuff that taste like dog shit.

30:22.695 --> 30:24.739
And how the guards
are always trying to fuck you. Tell her.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.660
It ain't funny.

30:30.453 --> 30:32.372
She's banging a drug dealer twice her age.

30:33.331 --> 30:34.165
Cesar?

30:35.416 --> 30:36.251
No.

30:39.546 --> 30:42.382
Some punk-ass trapper
who likes little girls.

30:42.465 --> 30:44.175
Tell her if she doesn't smarten up,

30:44.259 --> 30:46.553
then she's gonna fuck up her life
and end up in here.

30:48.930 --> 30:50.056
Oh, I see.

30:50.139 --> 30:51.850
So, I'm supposed to be
some kind of example

30:51.933 --> 30:53.643
of someone who fucks their life up?

30:53.726 --> 30:55.478
God forbid she should
turn out like me, right?

30:55.562 --> 30:56.646
Is that why you here?

30:57.230 --> 30:58.106
And to visit you.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.275
Yo, you're hilarious.

31:01.442 --> 31:05.321
Yo, Eva, why don't you ask Aleida
what she's doing to put food on the table?

31:05.905 --> 31:08.825
Huh? You think she gets all that money
from the milkshake she sells?

31:08.908 --> 31:10.827
-Nothing.

31:10.910 --> 31:12.161
Go ahead, tell her.

31:12.829 --> 31:14.539
-Tell her how you're selling dope...
-Daya!

31:14.622 --> 31:17.542
...so she could have a nice life,
instead of the fucked-up one I got.

31:17.625 --> 31:19.836
To be honest, though,
I am better off anyway.

31:19.919 --> 31:21.504
I fucking run this place.

31:22.297 --> 31:24.757
All I needed was to stay
as far as fucking possible away

31:24.841 --> 31:27.552
from you and your lessons.

31:51.200 --> 31:52.493
Yo, you get the beer?

31:52.577 --> 31:53.786
Beer's for pussies.

31:54.829 --> 31:56.456
Yeah.

31:56.539 --> 31:57.999
What, did you steal this
from a hobo or something?

31:58.082 --> 32:00.168
Nah! I hit up that store on Broadway.

32:00.251 --> 32:03.212
Grandpa owner's so blind,
I got a bottle and two mixers up my shirt,

32:03.296 --> 32:05.798
and he was all, "Oh, sweetie,
when's the baby due?"

32:07.634 --> 32:09.385
I think you're my hero.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.307
All right. Don't take all of it.

32:14.724 --> 32:15.892
Sorry.

32:17.393 --> 32:19.354
-All right. Okay.
-Mmm-hmm.

32:20.313 --> 32:21.439
Cheers.

32:26.110 --> 32:27.612
That shit is strong.

32:29.155 --> 32:30.365
But it's good, though.

32:30.448 --> 32:33.785
Yeah, it is. So much better
than the bullshit my mom used to drink.

32:33.868 --> 32:35.787
Useless bitch
didn't even know good liquor.

32:36.412 --> 32:38.498
Best thing I ever did
was ditch her sloppy ass.

32:39.082 --> 32:41.376
This one's to you, Valeria,
wherever the fuck you are.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.211
Somebody else's problem now.

32:43.294 --> 32:44.462
Cheers to that.

32:45.546 --> 32:46.506
Mmm.

32:47.256 --> 32:49.258
We should get tequila next time.

32:49.342 --> 32:53.346
I've always wanted to try it. And rum!
Maybe we'll be having twins!

32:54.806 --> 32:55.890
Nah, this is my drink.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.141
What do you mean, "your drink"?

32:58.101 --> 32:59.852
You know, my drink.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.729
You gotta have a drink,
so when you order at the bar,

33:01.813 --> 33:03.189
people know you're classy.

33:03.272 --> 33:04.941
But you can't have vodka orange soda,
that's mine.

33:05.316 --> 33:06.567
Damn.

33:08.194 --> 33:09.696
-Look! Mr. Chill-man! Come on, come on.
Wait.

33:09.779 --> 33:12.365
-Oh, my gosh. Girl! No!
-Last one there pays.

33:14.117 --> 33:15.201
Aleida!

33:16.327 --> 33:17.662
Move your...

33:19.122 --> 33:20.373
You're gonna pay!

33:23.835 --> 33:25.962
-Suck it.
Hello, girls.

33:26.045 --> 33:30.591
Uh, yeah, let me get a vanilla cone
with chocolate sprinkles.

33:31.175 --> 33:34.429
Uh, yeah, can I have a chocolate cone
with chocolate dip?

33:34.512 --> 33:35.596
Coming right up.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.766
Your, uh, mother know
you're skipping school today?

33:40.393 --> 33:41.811
I don't got a mother.

33:41.894 --> 33:44.230
Your father, then?
-He's gone.

33:44.313 --> 33:45.440
So, who do you live with?

33:46.149 --> 33:47.191
With a friend.

33:48.401 --> 33:49.902
And this friend, uh...

33:50.695 --> 33:51.863
he pays for your ice cream?

33:51.946 --> 33:54.824
I pay for my own ice cream.
I don't need nobody.

33:56.701 --> 33:57.702
Oh.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.121
So, you make your own money, huh?

34:03.124 --> 34:04.333
I got my ways.

34:06.461 --> 34:09.380
Yeah? Well, I got 30 bucks.

34:13.259 --> 34:16.596
Fifty. And, uh, free ice cream for life.

34:18.056 --> 34:20.433
Hold this.
And don't lick it, 'cause I'll know.

34:29.442 --> 34:31.277
-I have your four o'clock.
-Bring 'em in.

34:41.704 --> 34:44.624
I wasn't expecting you back so soon.
Won the Mega Millions?

34:44.707 --> 34:48.377
I'll do you one better.
I got a job... with the warden.

34:49.670 --> 34:51.964
-I'm her new assistant.

34:52.048 --> 34:55.718
So? I did it for you.
You need ears on the inside.

34:56.135 --> 34:57.887
I'll be the first to know
what she's planning.

34:57.970 --> 35:00.431
Transfers, guard changes, drug sweeps--

35:00.515 --> 35:03.935
Bitch, do you think I'm brand new?
I got the head guard on my team.

35:04.018 --> 35:07.146
If there's a sweep, he can raid the locker
where they stash the shit.

35:07.230 --> 35:09.023
-Mmm-hmm.

35:09.107 --> 35:13.152
Yeah, Tamika's number one enemy?
The one she's looking to fire?

35:13.528 --> 35:14.570
What

35:15.154 --> 35:17.657
See? You think you know shit,
but you don't know

35:17.740 --> 35:20.118
until you sit next
to the warden's office all day.

35:20.201 --> 35:22.912
I can be useful to you.
And more than just this intel shit,

35:22.995 --> 35:25.456
you need somebody to make a move
or whatever, I'll be there.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.584
So, you think if you do this for me,
then I'll give you what you asked for?

35:29.752 --> 35:30.878
Will you?

35:34.465 --> 35:35.758
Ain't she an old friend of yours?

35:35.842 --> 35:39.262
You must be real serious
if you willing to do her dirty like this.

35:41.264 --> 35:43.558
I am serious.

35:43.641 --> 35:45.309
So then, why you talking to me?

35:45.977 --> 35:48.312
Why don't you do it yourself
like the old

35:50.189 --> 35:51.190
Hmm?

35:54.318 --> 35:55.528
I tried.

35:59.365 --> 36:04.787
It's too hard the other way, okay?
Instincts kick in, and this is the way.

36:09.250 --> 36:10.835
It's a shame you didn't get the chair.

36:10.918 --> 36:14.255
Why?
So I could sit on death row for 15 years?

36:14.338 --> 36:15.798
Yeah. No, thank you.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.550
Shit, at least you get a last meal.

36:19.677 --> 36:22.013
If it were up to me, I would live it up.

36:23.306 --> 36:27.476
I don't know, I'll get like a never-ending
pasta bowl from Olive Garden,

36:27.560 --> 36:29.312
'cause it's never

36:30.021 --> 36:32.565
Plus, a Crave Case from White Castle.

36:32.648 --> 36:37.153
Fuck White Castle
and they tiny-ass burgers, dawg.

36:37.236 --> 36:43.659
What you need is a Storky's Supreme Meal
and a cheese with a gravy bundle.

36:43.743 --> 36:47.121
What is that?
-Exactly.

36:47.205 --> 36:50.249
Listen, see what you can dig up.

36:50.833 --> 36:52.585
You bring me back something useful,

36:52.668 --> 36:54.629
and then maybe
I could come through for you.

36:59.175 --> 37:01.219
How do I know
you're not gonna string me along?

37:01.302 --> 37:02.303
You don't.

37:04.138 --> 37:07.558
I only know if something's useful
if I see it.

37:07.850 --> 37:11.020
Otherwise, it's gonna be a G,
like we talked about.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.523
Right.

37:19.362 --> 37:23.532
And I know you have your plate full
with Blue Ivy and the twins,

37:23.616 --> 37:25.243
and keeping an eye on Jay,

37:25.326 --> 37:29.080
but I'm begging you, please, please,
please help my friend Blanca.

37:29.163 --> 37:33.125
She might seem scary and mean,
but she's just Dominican.

37:33.918 --> 37:35.002
-She's--
Psst.

37:35.086 --> 37:38.464
Hot Girl. Sorry about before
in the bathroom.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.049
I got a sensitive system.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.468
I can't eat too much salt

37:42.551 --> 37:47.431
or butter or dairy
or anything cooked in oil, only lard.

37:48.557 --> 37:49.809
What do you want?

37:49.892 --> 37:51.435
I heard you at the phones before.

37:51.519 --> 37:53.229
Sounded like you got in touch
with a lawyer?

37:53.980 --> 37:55.398
You were listening to me?

38:04.407 --> 38:07.118
I want the number,
the one that you called.

38:07.201 --> 38:10.538
I been trying to get a lawyer,
but I can't afford it,

38:10.621 --> 38:13.666
and all the free ones I tried,
they have at least a five-month wait.

38:13.749 --> 38:18.337
Please. I'm begging you.
My kids are out there, all alone.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.673
They don't even know I'm in here.

38:20.756 --> 38:23.301
I gotta get out of this place
before I lose them.

38:27.555 --> 38:30.975
Fine. I'll give it to you,
but you have to be very careful.

38:31.058 --> 38:31.934
I will.

38:35.938 --> 38:38.983
If the guards see you using this,
they're gonna shut it down.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.245
Thank you so much. God bless you.

39:47.510 --> 39:49.011
This is for a lawyer.

39:49.595 --> 39:51.430
Thank you. Thank you.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.396
Call this number. It's for a lawyer, okay?

39:58.479 --> 39:59.939
Okay. Thank you.

40:01.273 --> 40:03.526
You guys, this is for a lawyer.

40:09.490 --> 40:11.826
You seeing this?
Yes, I am. Why do the hot ones
always gotta cause trouble?

40:16.122 --> 40:17.832
Because they think
they can get away with it.

41:46.962 --> 41:48.130
Something's funky here.

41:48.214 --> 41:50.257
I had a poppy seed bagel for breakfast.

41:50.341 --> 41:53.093
I hear that poppy seeds
can alter the test results.

41:58.349 --> 41:59.391
Urban legend.

41:59.475 --> 42:02.728
That might've been true in the '80s,
but these things are super accurate now.

42:02.811 --> 42:07.107
And this is coming back invalid,
which means you probably tampered with it.

42:07.691 --> 42:09.151
Did you tamper with it?

42:09.735 --> 42:10.736
No.

42:17.701 --> 42:21.789
Look, I understand
if you had a little weed.

42:22.665 --> 42:26.126
I'm not gonna bust you for that,
but you need to come clean,

42:26.210 --> 42:29.255
'cause I'm gonna send this sample
to Albany for lab testing,

42:29.338 --> 42:33.467
in which case it will be on the record
and I will have to bust you.

42:35.594 --> 42:36.679
I had a bloob.

42:37.388 --> 42:38.931
-A bloob.

42:39.014 --> 42:41.016
It's a blueberry mixed with...

42:42.351 --> 42:44.937
-Never mind, I had some pot.
-Uh-huh. Mmm-hmm.

42:45.020 --> 42:47.690
It was a split-second decision
and I regret it immensely,

42:48.107 --> 42:49.817
and it will never happen again.

42:50.734 --> 42:53.237
And I am so...

42:54.905 --> 42:56.115
so thankful...

42:57.449 --> 42:58.993
for your understanding.

43:00.911 --> 43:03.581
Yeah, I'm not being understanding.

43:04.623 --> 43:06.417
That was a trick. I tricked you.

43:07.251 --> 43:09.128
What are you doing out here?

43:09.211 --> 43:11.714
What, you trying to fuck up
your second chance at life?

43:11.797 --> 43:14.341
Do you have any idea how lucky you are?

43:15.009 --> 43:20.848
I got women coming in here, four kids,
no support, working three jobs,

43:20.931 --> 43:25.227
doing everything they can to stay out,
and you running around eating weed fruits!

43:25.894 --> 43:27.605
What, you think this is some kind of joke?

43:27.980 --> 43:31.066
I don't. You're right.
I don't know what's wrong with me.

43:32.109 --> 43:33.193
I just...

43:35.821 --> 43:38.741
Things have been so hard.

43:40.659 --> 43:42.161
And I guess I just...

43:42.953 --> 43:44.830
I guess I just wanted a little break.

43:46.165 --> 43:48.000
And I really miss my wife.

43:55.674 --> 43:59.970
I've seen it before, people stuck
to their lives on the inside.

44:00.054 --> 44:02.598
But you gotta cut that shit out!

44:02.681 --> 44:04.725
You gotta focus on being here,

44:05.476 --> 44:07.686
or you're gonna end up
right back in there with her.

44:18.530 --> 44:22.618
I'm gonna have you go to ten NA meetings
at this halfway house.

44:25.454 --> 44:27.539
I need you to take this form,

44:29.124 --> 44:33.754
get it signed by the administrator there
after each meeting,

44:33.837 --> 44:36.048
and bring it back to me
when you're all done.

44:37.424 --> 44:42.221
While you're there, take a look around,
and think about how good you got it.

44:44.973 --> 44:47.017
-I will.
-Yeah.

44:47.976 --> 44:49.311
-Thank you.
-Mmm-hmm.

44:49.395 --> 44:53.273
"Bloob."  That's a silly word.

45:06.829 --> 45:07.871
Where's Ramos?

45:10.624 --> 45:12.251
What do you mean she's gone?

45:12.334 --> 45:14.837
I'm guessing they took her
to her hearing like me.

45:14.920 --> 45:17.297
So, that means that she's gonna
come back like you did, right?

45:17.381 --> 45:20.592
I wouldn't count on it.
It's like a Pack and Ship over there.  I got lucky I could copy
the Salvadoran hater who went ahead of me.

45:24.513 --> 45:26.724
I learned that even though
they don't give you a lawyer,

45:26.807 --> 45:29.768
you have the right to ask for more time
till you find one yourself.

45:29.852 --> 45:31.770
They can't deport Maritza!

45:31.854 --> 45:35.607
-Yo, she's never even been to Colombia!
-Hey. Stay positive.

45:35.691 --> 45:36.942
Maybe she's not at the hearing.

45:37.025 --> 45:40.738
Maybe her lawyer came early,
and she's sitting with her right now.

45:41.488 --> 45:42.322
She got a lawyer?

45:50.998 --> 45:52.499
It must be hell being trapped in here,

45:52.583 --> 45:56.044
the way people keep disappearing
like we're under Soviet occupation.

45:56.128 --> 45:59.214
Hey, maybe that's why Red's been
so on edge lately.

45:59.506 --> 46:00.924
You can't even imagine.

46:01.008 --> 46:04.845
On the bright side, though,
I got you something.

46:10.017 --> 46:11.643
You didn't.

46:11.727 --> 46:13.937
True blue American 'tater chips.

46:14.021 --> 46:16.648
Now, they're no salty god balls,

46:16.732 --> 46:18.859
but the ratio of sodium
to helpful nutrients

46:18.942 --> 46:19.985
is about the same as a tot.

46:20.068 --> 46:23.405
You're sweet... and salty.

46:26.450 --> 46:30.162
And now, he's out of the NICU,
so he can take a bottle.

46:30.245 --> 46:34.792
And he has a big appetite,
which means big, healthy poops.

46:35.167 --> 46:37.377
And Vinnie and I have
a special name for him.

46:37.461 --> 46:38.378
We have a few.

46:38.462 --> 46:42.674
One is Sterling Pooper,
another is Poopington Bear,

46:42.758 --> 46:45.427
or Jabba the Butt, uh...

46:45.886 --> 46:50.057
Stinky McTurdlet and Mr. Ca-poo-to.

46:52.935 --> 46:53.894
What are those for?

46:55.187 --> 46:57.815
For the casserole.
Did you forget to put them in?

46:59.608 --> 47:00.818
No, of course not.

47:01.401 --> 47:02.861
They must be left over.

47:04.738 --> 47:07.241
Go and get the beans
so we can start soaking them for tomorrow.

48:07.050 --> 48:09.094
-Nah.

48:10.345 --> 48:11.597
I needed that.

48:13.181 --> 48:15.601
-These kids got me stressed the fuck out.

48:16.768 --> 48:19.646
-I've been thinking...

48:21.273 --> 48:23.317
I've been thinking maybe we should
take a trip.

48:24.026 --> 48:25.027
You know?

48:26.153 --> 48:29.323
Just the two of us.
Get away from all the bullshit.

48:29.907 --> 48:31.283
Soon, baby.

48:31.366 --> 48:33.827
I almost got enough saved
to leave Mr. Clean,

48:34.411 --> 48:37.998
and then we can go somewhere expensive
and eat oysters,

48:38.081 --> 48:40.626
-and drink drinks with fruit in 'em. Ooh.
-Hmm.

48:41.126 --> 48:43.211
I'll even let you do that thing
with the beads.

48:43.295 --> 48:45.255
-All right. I can get with that.

48:48.216 --> 48:50.093
Stop, stupid.

48:50.928 --> 48:52.387
I could get with that.

48:54.056 --> 48:55.140
Damn.

48:55.223 --> 48:56.350
Shh.

48:58.977 --> 49:01.313
Fuck. Again with these kids.

49:01.396 --> 49:02.564
What the fuck, man?

49:02.648 --> 49:03.649
Hello.

49:06.401 --> 49:08.445
So, then eat something.

49:10.530 --> 49:12.157
So, where's Eva?

49:14.242 --> 49:15.118
She what?

49:19.957 --> 49:21.458
What does that even taste like?

49:22.209 --> 49:26.213
Like pleasure mixed with toothpaste.
Wanna try?

49:27.381 --> 49:28.215
Nah.

49:28.966 --> 49:29.925
All right.

49:31.760 --> 49:32.928
-Oh, shit!

49:34.262 --> 49:35.180
You think you're fucking slick?

49:35.263 --> 49:37.516
Like I wouldn't find out you're
at your crackhead boyfriend's house?

49:37.599 --> 49:40.268
So, he's a crackhead because he deals,
but it's okay when you do it?

49:40.352 --> 49:42.521
-Get in the fucking car.
-Fuck you.

49:44.231 --> 49:46.483
-I don't gotta listen to you.

49:46.566 --> 49:48.527
Yes, you do. I'm your mother.

49:48.610 --> 49:49.820
Yeah, when you're not in prison!

49:49.903 --> 49:52.656
Stop pretending like
you give a shit about me! Fuck you!

49:53.824 --> 49:56.201
Get the fuck out of here!
Oh, shit!

49:57.661 --> 49:59.496
Let go of me, you crazy bitch!

49:59.579 --> 50:00.914
Get off her. You're hurting her.

50:02.207 --> 50:04.960
Mom! Stop it! What are you doing?

50:05.043 --> 50:06.628
Mom!

50:07.587 --> 50:11.925
-Mom!
Huh?

50:12.009 --> 50:13.635
-Fucking pervert!

50:13.719 --> 50:15.887
Mom!
-Get off of me!

50:15.971 --> 50:18.932
Let go of him! Mom!

50:19.016 --> 50:20.475
Mom!

50:21.643 --> 50:22.477
Mom!

50:25.522 --> 50:29.901
Open up, you little bitch!
No one fucks with my kids!

50:30.485 --> 50:32.404
-Mom!

50:35.699 --> 50:36.825
What are you doing?

50:38.869 --> 50:41.913
No, Mom, stop it!

50:41.997 --> 50:43.749
What are you doing?
That's not even his car!

50:46.334 --> 50:50.130
About time we busted the fuck outta here.
This one felt like forever.

50:50.213 --> 50:53.300
Yeah, all these stank-ass bitches
are starting to get on my nerves.

50:53.383 --> 50:54.384
Like this one.

50:54.468 --> 50:56.970
-Fuck you, Aleida.
-Bye, girl. Love you.

50:57.054 --> 50:58.180
Keep it moving, ladies.

50:58.263 --> 51:00.891
I can't say goodbye to my friends?
Fucking friend police over here.

51:00.974 --> 51:03.018
Yeah, you can't talk to us
like that anymore,

51:03.101 --> 51:04.811
'cause we're free, bitch!

51:06.563 --> 51:08.065
Ugh. You mean you're free.

51:08.148 --> 51:10.317
I'm getting released back
to the evil drunk I came from.

51:10.400 --> 51:12.652
-I'm surprised she even showed up.
-Why don't you just ditch her ass

51:12.736 --> 51:13.987
and come live with me
and my brother, Ricky?

51:14.071 --> 51:15.405
What

51:15.489 --> 51:17.491
Nah, you don't gotta sling nothing.
Just package.

51:17.574 --> 51:19.743
Ricky slings. Trust me,
it is much better than tricking.

51:19.826 --> 51:20.827
And the money's better, too.

51:21.578 --> 51:23.080
Your brother, he cute?

51:23.163 --> 51:24.164
Ew!

51:24.790 --> 51:26.625
-Yeah.

51:33.632 --> 51:38.053
Can't believe I had to come
all the way out here for this shit.

51:38.136 --> 51:40.472
Yeah, I'm sure you had
a real productive day planned.

51:40.555 --> 51:42.099
You little brat.

51:42.766 --> 51:45.102
You're lucky your father's
back in the pen.

51:45.185 --> 51:48.522
Otherwise, he would beat your stupid ass,
the way you talk to me.

51:48.897 --> 51:50.524
Oh, yeah

51:50.607 --> 51:52.317
None of your business what he did.

51:52.859 --> 51:54.111
What up, sluts?

51:54.194 --> 51:56.113
Who the fuck is this?

51:56.196 --> 51:57.781
You must be the deadbeat mom.

51:57.864 --> 52:00.992
Now I see what you mean.
Aleida, this is my brother, Ricky.

52:01.076 --> 52:03.787
-Oh, damn. He is cute.
Ew!

52:03.870 --> 52:06.039
-She ain't goin' nowhere with you.

52:06.498 --> 52:08.875
Aleida, where you goin?
Aleida, open the door.

52:08.959 --> 52:11.962
Aleida! Aleida! Aleida, get back here!

52:12.587 --> 52:14.798
Aleida! Aleida!

52:20.053 --> 52:24.057
Oh. Looks like the casserole
did not go over very well.

52:24.141 --> 52:25.600
Perhaps it's a hunger strike.

52:25.684 --> 52:29.187
-Yeah, more like a will to live.
-Oh, for fuck's sake!

52:29.729 --> 52:33.024
Jeez, relax, Red!
They can't all be home runs.

52:34.943 --> 52:38.071
You think you're so funny,
don't you, Nicky?

52:38.321 --> 52:39.990
Making fun of the work I'm doing,

52:40.073 --> 52:43.910
while you're over here joking around
with your new flavor of the week.

52:43.994 --> 52:46.454
Who knew you were so into caramel?

52:47.122 --> 52:48.123
Seriously?

52:48.206 --> 52:52.711
Okay, everybody, relax.
It was just a little screw up, right, Red?

52:53.503 --> 52:56.006
That's right, Gloria.
And maybe if I had a kitchen staff

52:56.089 --> 52:58.258
that was actually helpful
instead of distracted,

52:58.341 --> 53:00.385
we wouldn't be serving food
that's inedible.

53:05.056 --> 53:06.683
Did she forget to cook the pasta?

53:11.438 --> 53:14.441
Maybe these ladies
aren't into American food.

53:15.108 --> 53:17.861
I'm gonna take over the stove,
make some Latin dishes.

53:17.944 --> 53:20.071
That way you could take a break.

53:20.488 --> 53:22.073
I don't need a break!

53:22.157 --> 53:24.075
I need a competent kitchen staff

53:24.159 --> 53:27.078
that isn't having
a goddamn telenovela in the corner.

53:29.539 --> 53:31.458
I'm just trying to help you, Red.

53:31.541 --> 53:35.003
Leave it alone, Gloria.
I'm not in the mood.

53:46.973 --> 53:50.644
Wow. You really cleaned up in here.
Did you get the phones working yet?

53:50.727 --> 53:52.771
Yep, and I'm almost done
with the receipts.

53:52.854 --> 53:55.815
You wanna know how much
the last warden spent on coffee?

53:56.650 --> 53:59.236
-No. No, I don't.
-It was a lot.

53:59.319 --> 54:01.363
-Now, you said that you wanted to make

54:01.446 --> 54:03.573
an appearance in each block every day.

54:03.657 --> 54:06.451
This might be a good time
to do your face-show,

54:06.534 --> 54:08.286
because you don't have
anything until 3:00,

54:08.370 --> 54:12.165
and I know that you get bummed
when you don't have your lunch.

54:12.249 --> 54:14.376
Look at you with the time management.

54:14.459 --> 54:16.253
Come on, man, don't be surprised.

54:16.336 --> 54:19.422
I was always the organized one
and you brought the fun.

54:19.506 --> 54:21.841
I don't think
I'm very much fun these days.

54:21.925 --> 54:24.594
Well, I can schedule it in for you,
if you need me to.

55:10.098 --> 55:11.016
Fuck.

55:33.955 --> 55:36.833
The guy said
he called you three times.

55:36.916 --> 55:39.753
Do you have any idea
how much breast milk you wasted?

55:39.836 --> 55:41.504
That was date night, Cal.

55:41.588 --> 55:44.674
That was a chance for me to go work
at the forge for a few hours.

55:44.758 --> 55:47.260
-That was my freedom in that freezer!

55:47.344 --> 55:49.763
It's only a little warm.
It will refreeze.

55:49.846 --> 55:52.390
No, Cal. You can't refreeze it.

55:52.474 --> 55:55.810
And it only lasts 24 hours after it thaws,
so you know what?

55:55.894 --> 55:58.855
You're gonna drink
this breast milk smoothie right now.

55:58.938 --> 56:03.109
I worked too damn hard milking myself
to watch it all thrown down the drain.

56:07.113 --> 56:08.406
I hope you're thirsty, Piper.

56:08.490 --> 56:10.492
-I am so sorry, Neri.
Drink up. It's got tons of antibodies.
