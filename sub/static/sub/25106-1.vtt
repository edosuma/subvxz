20:19.051 --> 20:22.054
It's a passion project for him.
His mother was a capist.

20:22.138 --> 20:23.848
Cool. Hey, what is a capist?

20:23.931 --> 20:25.141
Shh, we're rolling.

20:25.641 --> 20:27.893
Well, that is quite a story, Titus.

20:28.769 --> 20:30.104
What can I say?

20:30.187 --> 20:31.397
- I love love.
- [Titus gasps]

20:31.480 --> 20:32.690
So, yeah,

20:32.773 --> 20:34.191
just tell me how I can help.

20:34.275 --> 20:36.736
Well, I kind of told him
it was a fight scene.

20:36.819 --> 20:38.487
- Oh! Oh, okay.
- So just, you know...

20:38.571 --> 20:39.572
[Greg] Yeah. Say no more.

20:39.655 --> 20:40.489
- Just...
- Yeah.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.449
[clears throat]

20:41.532 --> 20:43.117
[both grunt]

20:43.200 --> 20:44.994
- [grunts, gasps]
- Oh! Uh...

20:45.077 --> 20:46.746
Did he see it? Did he buy it?

20:47.621 --> 20:49.248
Yeah! Go, Capist!

20:49.331 --> 20:50.791
[man] Quiet, please!

20:50.875 --> 20:52.084
[whispering] I think so.

20:54.128 --> 20:55.129
Well, Artie...

20:56.130 --> 20:59.300
you're finally gonna
be able to rest in peace.

21:00.843 --> 21:01.677
[door squeaks open]

21:02.595 --> 21:03.971
[laughs]

21:04.054 --> 21:07.641
Hey, what? You lightweights done already?

21:07.725 --> 21:10.978
Yeah, I'm supposed to testify
to the SEC in 20 minutes.

21:11.061 --> 21:12.313
Oh, really?

21:12.938 --> 21:16.108
Instead of skiing up Party Mountain?

21:17.234 --> 21:18.694
Noice!

21:18.778 --> 21:23.699
Just promise me you'll do all of it
while you're in there, okay?

21:24.867 --> 21:26.285
Is the pope a homo?

21:27.912 --> 21:30.414
[laughter]

21:30.498 --> 21:32.583
Now we're both at peace...

21:33.542 --> 21:37.379
and I made 1,200 bucks!

21:37.463 --> 21:43.219
[laughs] Ooh, this is the most fun
I've had disposing of a body since...

21:43.844 --> 21:47.056
Oh, well, just don't make me choose!

21:48.933 --> 21:49.767
Kimmy coming!

21:52.478 --> 21:53.979
Good morning, coworkers.

21:54.939 --> 21:56.857
Kimmy. You're back.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.694
Is everything... okay now?

22:02.822 --> 22:04.698
Because you made Tyler so nervous,

22:04.782 --> 22:07.034
he pasted his admin password
into the release notes

22:07.117 --> 22:08.911
for the new beta! [chuckles]

22:12.706 --> 22:15.751
Well, Zach,
I've concluded my investigation.

22:15.835 --> 22:19.004
And I've found a way
to give everyone a happy ending.

22:19.088 --> 22:22.049
[bright music playing]

22:22.132 --> 22:23.843
[man] Uh, because that's the only thing

22:23.926 --> 22:25.052
that can destroy the Wall.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.387
[man] But what's the science

22:26.470 --> 22:29.390
behind White Walker Drogon
breathing blue fire?

22:29.473 --> 22:30.808
[man] Um, for starters,

22:30.891 --> 22:32.685
Viserion is the ice dragon.

22:32.768 --> 22:33.978
And it doesn't matter,

22:34.061 --> 22:36.564
because if Bran is the Night King,
I'm done!

22:36.647 --> 22:38.399
[scoffs]

22:40.776 --> 22:42.027
Hey, you must be Mikey.

22:42.111 --> 22:42.987
- [gasps]
- Yeah.

22:43.070 --> 22:46.532
I've heard a lot about you from my costar.

22:46.615 --> 22:50.369
Wow! Greg Kinnear knows my name.
That's as good as it gets.

22:50.452 --> 22:52.621
[chuckles] That's awesome.

22:53.205 --> 22:55.916
Look, I got a grown man's
birthday party I gotta get to,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.253
but this was a treat,
and I'm glad this all worked out.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.879
Plan? [stammers] What plan?

23:00.963 --> 23:04.300
I mean me and you.
It's just cool that we can be friends now.

23:04.383 --> 23:05.551
It is cool.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.679
Maybe I'll call you
when I get my next monthly datum.

23:13.267 --> 23:14.101
[Greg] Wow.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.270
Hey, I know this was just a goof,

23:16.353 --> 23:18.397
but this was-- it was really fun, Titus.

23:18.480 --> 23:21.650
Remember when we were kids
and we would just... pretend?

23:23.193 --> 23:25.195
Well, I never stopped. [chuckles]

23:25.279 --> 23:27.740
And I dig that twisted brain
of yours, mister!

23:27.823 --> 23:29.533
We'll do it again for real sometime.

23:29.617 --> 23:32.161
Wait. Like, "for real" for realsies?

23:32.244 --> 23:35.372
Yeah. Yeah, why don't you write
this <i>Capist</i> thing up?

23:35.456 --> 23:36.540
We'll take it out together.

23:36.624 --> 23:39.001
YouTube Brown just bought ten episodes

23:39.084 --> 23:42.296
of "literally anything" from me,
and I don't have anything in the pipeline.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.923
Jacqueline White, White Talent.

23:45.007 --> 23:47.843
Titus would love to be
in the Greg Kinnear business.

23:47.926 --> 23:50.429
Okay, get me a script in a week or two.

23:51.555 --> 23:53.515
We get paid to dream.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.853
Oh, my God. I did it.

23:57.936 --> 23:59.104
Will you reach out to Greg

23:59.188 --> 24:01.273
and let him know
I can't make his deadline?

24:05.444 --> 24:08.364
[sinister percussive music playing]

24:13.452 --> 24:15.204
[man] Consider it done.
