00:04.588 --> 00:07.591
*

00:13.497 --> 00:15.499
(breathing heavily)

00:23.274 --> 00:25.276
-(blood spurting)
-(gasps)

00:29.346 --> 00:30.614
(panting)

00:30.648 --> 00:32.016
(cracking)

00:32.049 --> 00:33.484
(gasps)

00:33.517 --> 00:36.620
-(cracking)
-(gasps)

00:42.126 --> 00:44.295
(door opens, closes)

00:44.328 --> 00:45.697
TIFFANY:
Do you have it?

00:45.730 --> 00:47.131
Of course.

00:47.164 --> 00:49.166
Do you?

00:59.543 --> 01:02.013
Did she feel the pain?

01:02.046 --> 01:04.782
That bitch tried
to steal my husband.

01:04.816 --> 01:07.719
I want that whore
to have felt the pain.

01:17.929 --> 01:20.264
*

01:29.741 --> 01:32.376
I'm gonna need
something from you.

01:35.546 --> 01:38.082
Toenails? Nasty.

01:38.115 --> 01:40.084
You really hate your husband.

01:40.117 --> 01:41.085
No.

01:41.118 --> 01:43.387
I hate his wandering dick.

01:46.123 --> 01:49.761
Strawberries make it
go down easier.

01:57.134 --> 02:01.172
(gagging)

02:01.205 --> 02:02.606
Mm-mm.

02:02.639 --> 02:04.275
(gags)
Mm-mm.

02:04.308 --> 02:06.744
(gagging continues)

02:06.778 --> 02:09.713
(coughing)

02:09.747 --> 02:13.017
(gulping)

02:13.050 --> 02:16.653
(muffled shouting)

02:23.795 --> 02:24.829
(coughing)

02:30.667 --> 02:32.937
(exhales)

02:34.238 --> 02:36.107
That's it?

02:36.140 --> 02:38.109
Tell all your friends.

02:38.142 --> 02:40.978
The voodoo queen
can fix any problem.

02:41.012 --> 02:42.646
When he wakes up,

02:42.679 --> 02:44.816
he's not gonna remember a thing.

02:44.849 --> 02:46.750
And from this moment on,

02:46.784 --> 02:50.121
his dick won't get hard
for anyone but you.

02:50.154 --> 02:51.622
Good.

02:55.026 --> 02:56.593
(keys jangle)

03:00.031 --> 03:02.433
Making house calls?

03:02.466 --> 03:05.336
I can't believe
you would dare show your face,

03:05.369 --> 03:07.839
after what you witches done
to our queen.

03:07.872 --> 03:09.240
God rest her soul.

03:09.273 --> 03:10.875
You know we had nothing
to do with that.

03:12.676 --> 03:14.145
Fact is, Marie Laveau's demise

03:14.178 --> 03:16.914
elevated you
to the queen of voodoo.

03:16.948 --> 03:19.817
What's a queen without subjects?

03:19.851 --> 03:21.986
Or a domain?

03:22.019 --> 03:24.488
There's too much poverty
and crime in New Orleans

03:24.521 --> 03:25.789
to scratch out a goddamn living.

03:25.823 --> 03:27.158
And out here,

03:27.191 --> 03:29.793
not enough white folks
come to us for voodoo.

03:29.827 --> 03:32.796
They don't want to be
appropriating our culture.

03:32.830 --> 03:34.598
I call bullshit.

03:34.631 --> 03:37.034
The only thing that matters in
this world isn't white or black.

03:37.068 --> 03:38.469
It's green.

03:38.502 --> 03:40.838
You got money,
all the doors open.

03:40.872 --> 03:43.440
Maybe you can open one for me.

03:43.474 --> 03:45.809
I need your help, Dinah.

03:45.843 --> 03:47.811
You're the most powerful witch
in the world.

03:47.845 --> 03:49.513
What can I do that you couldn't?

03:50.647 --> 03:53.050
Get me a meeting
with Papa Legba.

03:55.319 --> 03:58.122
You're at a crossroads,
Cordelia.

03:58.155 --> 03:59.656
That would be the only reason

03:59.690 --> 04:01.825
you need to talk
to the voodoo devil.

04:01.859 --> 04:04.328
I'll owe you one.

04:04.361 --> 04:06.697
I don't do favors.

04:07.865 --> 04:10.101
$100,000.

04:11.502 --> 04:13.370
Cash.

04:14.872 --> 04:17.108
*

04:47.771 --> 04:49.974
*

05:21.772 --> 05:23.774
*

05:39.923 --> 05:41.892
NIGEL:
Merry Christmas, dearest.

05:41.925 --> 05:43.827
I hope you like it.

05:43.860 --> 05:46.397
It's never easy shopping
for the most beautiful woman

05:46.430 --> 05:47.965
in the world.

05:47.999 --> 05:48.966
(chuckles):
Oh, darling.

05:49.000 --> 05:52.136
It doesn't matter--

05:52.169 --> 05:53.304
What the hell is this?

05:53.337 --> 05:56.307
I always feel so inadequate

05:56.340 --> 05:58.309
whenever you wear heels,
crumpet.

05:58.342 --> 06:01.012
You know how sensitive I am
about my height.

06:01.045 --> 06:03.580
Why worry about your height

06:03.614 --> 06:07.518
when you're so inadequate
in so many other areas?

06:07.551 --> 06:09.520
Here we go.

06:09.553 --> 06:11.755
-Mm.
-Try to remember

06:11.788 --> 06:14.825
that this is the season
of giving.

06:14.858 --> 06:17.161
Well, this is what I would like
to give you!

06:17.194 --> 06:20.197
(scoffs)
You haven't the guts.

06:21.198 --> 06:23.567
-(grunts)
-(gasps)

06:25.002 --> 06:26.470
-(cackling)
-(grunts)

06:28.172 --> 06:29.273
Neither have you.

06:29.306 --> 06:30.607
(groaning)

06:30.641 --> 06:32.609
And I fucked
your business partner

06:32.643 --> 06:35.946
every year since 1972.

06:35.979 --> 06:38.015
TILLY:
Grandma? Grandma?

06:38.049 --> 06:41.152
Grandma! I heard a noise.

06:41.185 --> 06:42.153
Is Santa here?

06:42.186 --> 06:43.954
Oh, not yet, sweetie.

06:43.987 --> 06:45.389
Now, you go back to bed,

06:45.422 --> 06:47.558
because if he knows
you're awake,

06:47.591 --> 06:48.659
you might scare him off.

06:53.430 --> 06:55.899
(grunting)

06:57.534 --> 06:59.536
(squeaking)

07:03.240 --> 07:06.977
(sighs)
Horrible old bastard.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.046
-Ugh.
-(doorbell rings)

07:09.080 --> 07:10.714
(pounding on door)

07:10.747 --> 07:11.715
(doorknob rattling)

07:11.748 --> 07:13.617
-Yes?
-(pounding continues)

07:15.719 --> 07:17.921
If you're collecting
for charity,

07:17.954 --> 07:20.924
I don't give to charity.

07:20.957 --> 07:23.494
NEWSCASTER:
We interrupt to bring you

07:23.527 --> 07:24.861
this emergency news bulletin.

07:24.895 --> 07:26.497
The individual who escaped
from the Brisbane Asylum

07:26.530 --> 07:28.499
for the Criminally Insane
has now been identified

07:28.532 --> 07:30.601
as the notorious
Decapitation Killer.

07:30.634 --> 07:32.903
He is a white male,
six feet tall,

07:32.936 --> 07:35.005
and dressed
in a Santa Claus suit.

07:35.038 --> 07:37.007
If spotted, do not attempt
to engage the killer,

07:37.040 --> 07:39.776
but immediately contact
the police.

07:42.146 --> 07:45.116
(thumping overhead)

07:47.050 --> 07:48.719
CRAZED SANTA:
Ho ho ho.

07:48.752 --> 07:51.122
It's Santa!
He's coming down the chimney!

07:51.155 --> 07:55.092
-Ho ho ho.
-No!

07:57.894 --> 08:00.097
(screams)

08:00.131 --> 08:01.064
No!

08:01.098 --> 08:02.466
(screams)

08:02.499 --> 08:04.101
(snarls)

08:07.138 --> 08:08.305
Run!

08:08.339 --> 08:09.573
To the neighbors!

08:11.175 --> 08:13.277
(pounding continues)

08:13.310 --> 08:15.078
(gasps)

08:15.112 --> 08:17.148
(grunting)

08:17.181 --> 08:19.550
(screams, gasps)

08:19.583 --> 08:21.385
Ho ho ho.

08:21.418 --> 08:22.986
No...!

08:23.019 --> 08:24.388
Ho ho...

08:24.421 --> 08:26.056
-(coughs)
-DIRECTOR: Cut!

08:26.089 --> 08:27.291
(bell rings)

08:27.324 --> 08:28.725
-Sorry.
-Jesus Christ.

08:28.759 --> 08:30.761
My bad. It's my dry throat.

08:30.794 --> 08:33.797
Will someone get Santa
a cough drop?

08:33.830 --> 08:35.766
And please get me out of here.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.768
-Come on, Bubbles.
-(grunting)

08:37.801 --> 08:39.670
-BUBBLES: Ow. God.
-You all right?

08:39.703 --> 08:41.672
-Who cast that guy?
-I don't know.

08:41.705 --> 08:43.674
Hey, but we're gonna rehearse
your stunt later, all right?

08:43.707 --> 08:46.343
No.
Oh, I, I got the lines right.

08:46.377 --> 08:48.912
This is killing me, this belt.

08:48.945 --> 08:50.347
Ow.

08:50.381 --> 08:51.915
Ooh, thanks.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.184
Oh.

08:56.820 --> 08:59.623
GRIP: Hey,
the old broad still has it.

08:59.656 --> 09:02.526
Oh, man, I got to take a shit.

09:02.559 --> 09:05.028
Congratulations!
I suppose, for you,

09:05.061 --> 09:07.164
taking a shit
is a form of reproduction.

09:07.198 --> 09:08.632
Go on.

09:08.665 --> 09:10.267
Go to it. Go on.

09:10.301 --> 09:13.170
You still have
a way with people.

09:13.204 --> 09:15.839
Well, well, well.

09:15.872 --> 09:18.141
So, the disturbing rumors
are true.

09:18.175 --> 09:20.143
You are back.

09:20.177 --> 09:21.612
Which is more
than I can say for you.

09:21.645 --> 09:24.147
Didn't you already make
this movie?

09:24.181 --> 09:26.016
Before they had sound?

09:26.049 --> 09:28.952
When was the last time that you
were on a movie set, missy?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.954
I mean other than the ones
in which the actors

09:30.987 --> 09:33.190
don't have to wear protection.

09:33.224 --> 09:35.292
You were one of the reasons
why I left the coven.

09:35.326 --> 09:38.229
As the only witch
who was also an actress...

09:38.262 --> 09:40.231
-Says you.
-I repeat,

09:40.264 --> 09:42.666
as the only witch
who was also an actress,

09:42.699 --> 09:46.069
I decided that I didn't want
to be living like a nun

09:46.102 --> 09:48.305
and herding
all those spoiled brats

09:48.339 --> 09:50.307
when I could be out
honing my craft.

09:50.341 --> 09:53.210
(coughing loudly)

09:53.244 --> 09:55.178
-Your craft?
-Yes.

09:55.212 --> 09:58.649
Witchcraft is a talent
that I was born with.

09:58.682 --> 10:01.985
But acting, I had to work for.

10:02.018 --> 10:03.387
I had to struggle.

10:03.420 --> 10:05.256
You and your generation think
that you can get

10:05.289 --> 10:07.090
whatever you want
with the click of a mouse

10:07.123 --> 10:09.159
or the uttering of a spell.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.262
But, let me tell you,

10:11.295 --> 10:13.230
to achieve something,

10:13.264 --> 10:16.166
that's magic
of the highest order.

10:16.199 --> 10:18.269
-Oh.
-Oh.

10:18.302 --> 10:19.870
Well, I didn't come here
to visit.

10:19.903 --> 10:21.438
You've been summoned.

10:21.472 --> 10:23.206
Summoned?

10:23.240 --> 10:25.709
(sighs)
We are facing a situation.

10:25.742 --> 10:27.711
Like, a world situation.

10:27.744 --> 10:29.846
Like "everything we know hangs
in the balance" kind of thing.

10:29.880 --> 10:32.283
So it's all hands on deck.

10:32.316 --> 10:33.884
Even the ones with age spots.

10:36.953 --> 10:39.055
Get your broom.

10:39.089 --> 10:41.458
-(chuckles)
-Cheers.

10:41.492 --> 10:43.294
You bitch.

10:48.465 --> 10:52.035
WAITER: Wow, I think I've seen
her in a movie before.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.604
I wonder what kind of panties
she's got on.

10:53.637 --> 10:55.872
Yesterday was silk.

10:55.906 --> 10:58.241
I'm sorry?

10:58.275 --> 11:00.076
But I prefer to wear nothing.

11:01.845 --> 11:04.748
(chuckles)

11:04.781 --> 11:06.383
Wait, that's your power?

11:06.417 --> 11:09.052
What you are witnessing,
my dear,

11:09.085 --> 11:11.154
is my human wiles.

11:11.187 --> 11:14.958
MYRTLE: Bubbles has the power
of lectio animo.

11:14.991 --> 11:17.561
The ability to listen
to someone's very soul.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.430
So the bitch reads minds.

11:19.463 --> 11:21.097
Bubbles knows exactly how

11:21.131 --> 11:23.400
to extract the truth
in any situation,

11:23.434 --> 11:25.736
which is precisely why
we need her.

11:25.769 --> 11:28.238
I'm presuming the two of you
go way back

11:28.271 --> 11:30.441
to the very dawn of time.

11:30.474 --> 11:33.143
We were young witches
at the academy

11:33.176 --> 11:34.645
and we became instant friends.

11:34.678 --> 11:36.279
MYRTLE:
To this day,

11:36.313 --> 11:39.316
my mastery of the art of
fellatio is unparalleled,

11:39.350 --> 11:42.653
thanks to this special teacher
here at the table.

11:42.686 --> 11:44.855
MADISON:
Okay, let me be the adult here

11:44.888 --> 11:47.023
and redirect this trip
down memory lane.

11:48.325 --> 11:50.126
We have a real fucking problem.

11:50.160 --> 11:53.530
Our next Supreme has us
barreling towards annihilation.

11:53.564 --> 11:56.700
The issue here is not only
Michael, it's the warlocks.

11:56.733 --> 12:00.170
They're protecting him.
Ariel Augustus...

12:00.203 --> 12:02.539
You think he's dangerous,
impatient.

12:02.573 --> 12:06.309
Hell-bent on clearing
a path for Michael...

12:06.343 --> 12:08.779
yet with nary a detail
of what you heard,

12:08.812 --> 12:11.314
you expect me to read his mind.

12:11.348 --> 12:13.550
Did you just read hers?

12:13.584 --> 12:16.119
Like a Sidney Sheldon novel,
darling.

12:16.152 --> 12:18.489
Then you must know the gravity
of the situation.

12:18.522 --> 12:21.224
That Michael is the spawn
of Satan?

12:21.257 --> 12:24.127
Yes, that thought has been
traipsing through Madison's mind

12:24.160 --> 12:25.962
ever since she first
sat down here.

12:25.996 --> 12:29.199
I know that a male Supreme is
a tough pill to swallow,

12:29.232 --> 12:32.403
but it won't be the literal end
of the world.

12:33.404 --> 12:35.439
Just come with us to Hawthorne.

12:36.407 --> 12:39.410
I'll arrange a dinner; I'll even
steer the conversation.

12:39.443 --> 12:41.712
But we need you to find out
what Ariel knows

12:41.745 --> 12:44.381
and what he's planning.

12:44.415 --> 12:47.150
If you won't do it for
the future of the planet,

12:47.183 --> 12:50.654
perhaps you'll do it to repay me
for my decades of loyalty.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.556
Out of all the people currently
in your life,

12:52.589 --> 12:55.325
I'd wager there's only one
who's come close enough

12:55.358 --> 12:57.994
to learn your actual age.

12:58.028 --> 13:01.264
Ha. Hmm.

13:01.297 --> 13:03.299
Cheers.

13:08.439 --> 13:11.908
Are you sure about this,
Cordelia?

13:13.610 --> 13:18.381
Make a deal with Papa Legba
and he will fulfill his end.

13:18.415 --> 13:21.452
But he'll make damn sure
you do, too.

13:25.088 --> 13:26.957
Don't promise anything
you can't deliver.

13:26.990 --> 13:28.459
I understand.

13:51.482 --> 13:53.383
Papa Legba,

13:53.416 --> 13:58.288
ouvirier barrier pour moi agoe.

13:59.456 --> 14:02.092
Papa Legba,

14:02.125 --> 14:05.261
ouvirier barrier

14:05.295 --> 14:07.831
pour moi agoe.

14:07.864 --> 14:09.633
Papa Legba,

14:09.666 --> 14:14.538
ouvirier barrier pour moi agoe.

14:18.542 --> 14:20.376
(gasps)

14:26.483 --> 14:30.020
(sighs)

14:30.053 --> 14:32.288
Dinah Stevens.

14:32.322 --> 14:35.692
No voodoo priestess gives me
better rum.

14:35.726 --> 14:38.328
Hello, Papa.

14:38.361 --> 14:41.097
PAPA LEGBA:
You've outdone yourself, Mambo.

14:41.131 --> 14:45.035
Does this mean you've
reconsidered my offer?

14:45.068 --> 14:46.537
Hell no.

14:46.570 --> 14:49.105
You charge more for immortality

14:49.139 --> 14:51.542
than a little Cuban contraband.

14:51.575 --> 14:54.945
And I told you, I'm not about
snatching newborns

14:54.978 --> 14:56.980
from the maternity ward.

14:58.381 --> 15:01.785
I'm here because she paid me.

15:01.818 --> 15:04.187
So let's get to it.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.323
The Witch Queen.

15:07.357 --> 15:10.293
I've been looking forward
to this meeting.

15:10.326 --> 15:14.130
You come with
an intriguing request.

15:14.164 --> 15:15.498
You know why I'm here?

15:15.532 --> 15:17.701
The Antichrist.

15:17.734 --> 15:21.738
Michael Langdon,
bringer of the End of Days.

15:21.772 --> 15:25.008
But what makes you think
I can help?

15:25.041 --> 15:29.546
I am merely a gatekeeper between
humanity and the underworld.

15:29.580 --> 15:33.016
Open the gates.

15:33.049 --> 15:35.218
I will lure him inside

15:35.251 --> 15:38.188
and he will be condemned
to roam the underworld.

15:38.221 --> 15:42.192
Betray Satan's spawn... Ouf.

15:42.225 --> 15:46.830
I would be putting myself
at great risk.

15:46.863 --> 15:48.565
Name your price.

15:48.599 --> 15:50.601
(chuckles)

15:54.204 --> 15:58.208
The last time a conspiring Mambo
and Witch Queen summoned me...

15:59.375 --> 16:01.612
...they brought me
the greatest offering.

16:04.147 --> 16:06.617
Come out, child.

16:08.619 --> 16:10.654
Oh, my God.

16:12.255 --> 16:15.592
Cordelia,
long time no see, bitch.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.961
Fucking Fiona.

16:19.630 --> 16:21.364
If you've hurt her...

16:21.397 --> 16:22.599
It's okay.

16:22.633 --> 16:24.601
Papa's nice to me.

16:24.635 --> 16:27.570
And I really like Hell,
it's fun.

16:27.604 --> 16:28.639
Fun?

16:29.906 --> 16:31.241
What do you do down there?

16:31.274 --> 16:33.810
I make trouble.

16:33.844 --> 16:36.613
(both laugh)

16:36.647 --> 16:40.183
Nan is my favorite
little helper.

16:42.185 --> 16:45.555
I could use more like her.

16:45.588 --> 16:48.158
You want me to give you a soul.

16:48.191 --> 16:50.994
And you want me
to perform a coup.

16:51.027 --> 16:55.832
An order so tall demands
a steep price.

16:55.866 --> 17:00.804
Not one soul, but all of them.

17:03.006 --> 17:04.307
Your girls.

17:07.343 --> 17:09.813
No.

17:09.846 --> 17:12.248
I won't give you my girls.

17:12.282 --> 17:13.917
You want a soul, take mine.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.852
You are not enough.

17:15.886 --> 17:18.021
I'm the most powerful witch
on Earth.

17:18.054 --> 17:20.957
(laughs)

17:23.660 --> 17:25.495
I've made my offer.

17:25.528 --> 17:29.199
Turn it down and you will not
get another.

17:29.232 --> 17:31.634
Don't be a fool, Cordelia.

17:31.668 --> 17:34.905
NAN: Please? I want to see
my friends again. I miss them.

17:37.741 --> 17:38.975
I'm sorry, Nan.

17:40.343 --> 17:41.845
I can't.

17:50.086 --> 17:54.390
(sniffs) Mmm.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.830
Then we have no deal.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.569
Come, child.

18:11.007 --> 18:12.743
Dinah, what do I have to do?

18:12.776 --> 18:15.678
There must be something else
I can offer,

18:15.712 --> 18:17.347
something else that I can do.

18:17.380 --> 18:18.915
It doesn't work like that.

18:18.949 --> 18:21.718
Papa made you an offer
and he only makes one.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.754
And you refused him.

18:23.787 --> 18:25.922
So that's it. You blew it.

18:25.956 --> 18:29.392
Now, not only
will your girls die,

18:29.425 --> 18:33.596
but six billion
other people will, too.

18:49.980 --> 18:52.783
MALLORY: So what's the new
Supreme like? Is he nice?

18:52.816 --> 18:54.951
-Girl, he ain't
nobody's Supreme yet.
-MALLORY: I don't get it.

18:54.985 --> 18:57.587
So, when does he become Supreme?

18:59.322 --> 19:01.892
Um...

19:01.925 --> 19:05.962
The new Supreme rises only when
the old one dies.

19:10.801 --> 19:12.803
(footfalls approaching,
Coco speaking indistinctly)

19:12.836 --> 19:15.638
You guys.
You guys, you guys!

19:15.671 --> 19:16.739
You're never gonna believe it.

19:16.773 --> 19:17.740
What?

19:17.774 --> 19:18.909
I discovered a new power.

19:18.942 --> 19:20.977
I don't want to toot
my own horn,

19:21.011 --> 19:23.113
but it's pretty incredible.

19:23.146 --> 19:25.148
(moans)

19:28.584 --> 19:32.255
(gasps) 476 calories.

19:32.288 --> 19:33.824
Mal?

19:33.857 --> 19:37.160
Large chocolate chip muffin
is 476 calories.

19:37.193 --> 19:40.230
Bullshit. You looked it up,
didn't you?

19:40.263 --> 19:42.833
No, I swear on the souls of
the Supremes that I didn't.

19:42.866 --> 19:46.669
I just stare at a piece of food
and a number pops into my head.

19:46.702 --> 19:48.805
That means your powers
are growing.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.273
That's great.

19:50.306 --> 19:52.342
That's amazing, Coco.

19:52.375 --> 19:54.244
I told you, you just needed
to apply yourself.

19:54.277 --> 19:56.813
I used to feel embarrassed
about my powers,

19:56.847 --> 19:59.182
but now I'm kind of proud.

19:59.215 --> 20:02.085
Like, I think I could really
help people with this.

20:02.118 --> 20:04.787
Kind of like a human
Weight Watchers.

20:04.821 --> 20:07.623
Now, why don't you show us
what else you can do?

20:07.657 --> 20:10.861
(moans, gasps) 407.

20:10.894 --> 20:12.595
Right.

20:12.628 --> 20:15.866
(moans, gasps)

20:15.899 --> 20:18.301
924. 606. 150.

20:18.334 --> 20:19.469
She's right.

20:19.502 --> 20:21.604
Aw, yeah.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.606
(moans)

20:23.639 --> 20:25.775
-49.
-Right again.

20:25.808 --> 20:27.677
Okay, no, no. One more.
One more, one more.

20:27.710 --> 20:29.212
Okay, you know what?
I think I need a break.

20:29.245 --> 20:30.947
It really takes it out of me,
you know?

20:30.981 --> 20:33.549
-QUEENIE: Don't be a pussy!
-Whew!

20:35.818 --> 20:39.655
The only way
to expand your powers...

20:39.689 --> 20:40.690
is by pushing yourself.

20:40.723 --> 20:42.658
With a Sno Ball?

20:42.692 --> 20:45.795
Do you want to just trust me?

20:45.828 --> 20:49.732
(moans, gasps) 80.

20:49.765 --> 20:52.568
ZOE: (scoffs) No way there's
only 80 calories in that thing.

20:54.037 --> 20:55.972
-(gasps)
-(gasps)

20:56.006 --> 20:58.008
QUEENIE: Yeah, I always think
I love these things,

20:58.041 --> 20:59.842
then I take two bites
and it turns out I hate them.

20:59.876 --> 21:02.545
I don't have that problem. Mmm.

21:02.578 --> 21:04.414
Guess that ass could use
another 80 calories, huh?

21:04.447 --> 21:05.715
(laughs)

21:05.748 --> 21:08.551
-(laughs)
-(coughs)

21:08.584 --> 21:12.255
-(gagging, choking)
-ZOE: Hey. Hey, are you okay?

21:12.288 --> 21:14.490
-Holy shit. Coco, breathe.
Okay, breathe!
-QUEENIE: Hey, hey, hey.

21:14.524 --> 21:15.926
Coco, just...

21:15.959 --> 21:18.895
(voices echoing)

21:18.929 --> 21:19.930
Do a spell!

21:19.963 --> 21:21.898
(voices echoing)

21:21.932 --> 21:23.166
Oh, shit, she's dead now.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.768
(screaming)

21:41.151 --> 21:42.986
*

21:51.161 --> 21:54.931
(gasps, coughs)

21:54.965 --> 21:56.632
QUEENIE: Okay, hey, hey, hey,
hey, you're okay.

21:59.069 --> 21:59.936
What was that?

22:02.172 --> 22:03.806
I just...

22:03.839 --> 22:05.375
helped her.

22:05.408 --> 22:07.343
I've never seen
anything like it.

22:09.946 --> 22:13.984
I've never even heard of a spell
for what you just did.

22:25.661 --> 22:27.163
(exhales)

22:28.764 --> 22:30.133
I've got you.

22:32.668 --> 22:35.338
I don't want the girls
to see me like this.

22:35.371 --> 22:37.340
Will you help me to my room?

22:37.373 --> 22:39.109
Of course.

22:44.647 --> 22:48.118
It's happening faster
than I expected.

22:49.986 --> 22:52.788
Michael will destroy us.

22:55.825 --> 22:57.994
He's already started with me.

23:00.463 --> 23:02.932
I can't fight him, Zoe.

23:02.965 --> 23:05.468
Not in my condition.

23:09.839 --> 23:11.941
Maybe you don't have to.

23:11.974 --> 23:14.477
Maybe there's someone here
who will be ready.

23:16.912 --> 23:18.948
I don't think you're fading

23:18.981 --> 23:20.883
because Michael's
the next Supreme.

23:21.851 --> 23:24.654
I think it's Mallory.

23:29.325 --> 23:32.262
(theremin playing eerie melody)

23:35.931 --> 23:37.933
*

23:39.702 --> 23:43.039
Oh, Myrtle, you are a genius.

23:43.073 --> 23:47.210
Every note you play has a way
of entering my body

23:47.243 --> 23:49.812
and stirring things up.

23:49.845 --> 23:51.881
Easy on the champagne, dear.

23:51.914 --> 23:54.350
We're here on business.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.854
(theremin stops)

23:58.888 --> 24:00.490
Ladies.

24:00.523 --> 24:03.025
To what do we owe the pleasure?

24:03.059 --> 24:04.894
We've prepared a meal

24:04.927 --> 24:07.063
as a form of apology.

24:08.964 --> 24:11.101
I realize now that
under trying circumstances,

24:11.134 --> 24:14.070
some words may have
been spoken that were...

24:14.104 --> 24:16.339
poorly articulated.

24:16.372 --> 24:20.110
You called him
a pathetic, pompous ass.

24:21.277 --> 24:23.113
An error she is eager
to redress.

24:24.147 --> 24:25.848
I am Bubbles.

24:25.881 --> 24:27.517
Bubbles McGee.
You may have seen me

24:27.550 --> 24:29.119
on the silver screen.

24:30.120 --> 24:32.088
Well, maybe on one
of those procedurals

24:32.122 --> 24:34.124
that you see on CBS.

24:35.558 --> 24:39.095
Well, my true magic
is in the kitchen.

24:39.129 --> 24:41.264
And tonight
we have prepared for you

24:41.297 --> 24:42.765
the most wonderful, delicious,

24:42.798 --> 24:45.701
succulent meal
of your entire life.

24:45.735 --> 24:48.070
And why would we ever want
to dine with you?

24:48.104 --> 24:50.973
Because I was wrong
and you were right.

24:52.175 --> 24:54.644
I have to swallow my hubris.

24:54.677 --> 24:57.313
A man will be our next Supreme.

24:57.347 --> 24:59.449
He won the position
fair and square.

24:59.482 --> 25:01.551
I want to show you my loyalty,

25:01.584 --> 25:04.120
and you can show me
your forgiveness.

25:04.154 --> 25:07.923
We can be the example
that unites our covens.

25:17.133 --> 25:19.969
Mmm. Bubbles,
you've exceeded your promise.

25:20.002 --> 25:21.671
This is a meal fit
for a Supreme.

25:21.704 --> 25:23.139
(chuckles):
Oh, thank you so much.

25:23.173 --> 25:24.674
Where is our dear Michael?

25:24.707 --> 25:26.409
I was hoping he could join us.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.110
In the wilderness.

25:28.144 --> 25:30.346
Literally.
Michael has decided

25:30.380 --> 25:33.283
that he needs to be
completely alone.

25:33.316 --> 25:35.485
Cordelia had
a similar awakening.

25:35.518 --> 25:37.153
ARIEL:
Oh, no.

25:37.187 --> 25:38.354
(chuckles):
I've had enough.

25:38.388 --> 25:40.356
Oh, but this is Château Lafite.

25:40.390 --> 25:43.159
The bottle alone is
the same price as a small house.

25:43.193 --> 25:46.496
-(quietly): Oh, come on.
-This is a special bottle.

25:46.529 --> 25:50.633
I must tell you the story
of how we procured it.

25:50.666 --> 25:52.635
We were in Madrid.

25:52.668 --> 25:54.136
(fading):
Maybe it was Barcelona...

25:54.170 --> 25:55.605
BALDWIN:
God, I hate

25:55.638 --> 25:58.007
-this bitch.
-We happened upon

25:58.040 --> 26:02.212
this amazing little shop
with an ancient old man.

26:02.245 --> 26:03.946
He would vanish somewhere
and bring out

26:03.979 --> 26:05.348
mysterious bottles of wine.

26:05.381 --> 26:07.116
ARIEL: No one
has brought up John Henry.

26:07.149 --> 26:11.020
I'm glad that fucker
is a pile of ash.

26:11.053 --> 26:12.222
After some conversation, and...

26:12.255 --> 26:14.190
maybe a little
magical intervention...

26:14.224 --> 26:16.226
-Oh.
-...he brought us down

26:16.259 --> 26:19.195
to a secret cellar filled
with spectacular reds

26:19.229 --> 26:22.565
stolen from Mussolini's
private collection.

26:22.598 --> 26:25.401
Oh, I love a full-bodied red.

26:25.435 --> 26:28.371
We got the Lafite for a bargain.

26:28.404 --> 26:31.173
I don't like to use my magic
for personal gain.

26:31.207 --> 26:33.809
ARIEL: I can't wait
until they're dead,

26:33.843 --> 26:36.812
every last stinking witch.

26:36.846 --> 26:38.214
You're right, of course.

26:38.248 --> 26:39.749
Bad Myrtle.

26:39.782 --> 26:41.183
(laughter)

26:41.217 --> 26:43.686
This has been such a delight.

26:43.719 --> 26:46.589
I knew, if we could dine
together, we would find...

26:46.622 --> 26:48.224
commonality and, dare I say...

26:48.258 --> 26:50.260
BALDWIN:
I want to wipe the smiles

26:50.293 --> 26:51.827
off their smug little faces.

26:51.861 --> 26:53.229
(laughter)

26:55.265 --> 26:58.401
Oh, my.
It's getting late.

27:00.603 --> 27:03.906
Oh. It is. Very late.
(chuckles weakly)

27:03.939 --> 27:07.243
But I feel like we've finally
gotten to know each other.

27:07.277 --> 27:08.678
Well, don't bother.

27:08.711 --> 27:10.880
We'll clear everything up.

27:16.286 --> 27:17.520
Amateurs.

27:17.553 --> 27:20.256
Well, what'd you hear?

27:20.290 --> 27:22.292
They murdered one of their own.

27:22.325 --> 27:26.462
And now they mean
to murder all of us.

27:26.496 --> 27:29.064
Well, it's perfectly clear.

27:29.098 --> 27:31.233
It's kill or be killed.

27:33.102 --> 27:34.470
We'll tell Cordelia,

27:34.504 --> 27:36.472
strike back together.

27:45.748 --> 27:48.751
-*
-(indistinct chatter)

27:52.322 --> 27:55.257
(others laughing)

27:55.291 --> 27:57.660
These are marvelous.

27:57.693 --> 27:59.429
Hey, what's the matter?

27:59.462 --> 28:01.096
I just feel weird.

28:01.130 --> 28:04.233
I don't want to rise if it means
Miss Cordelia has to fall.

28:04.266 --> 28:07.370
Don't ever be ashamed
of who you are, Mallory.

28:09.472 --> 28:12.274
This is how it's always worked.

28:12.308 --> 28:15.478
And when the time does come,
I will be heartened to know

28:15.511 --> 28:18.280
that you will be the one
to lead this coven.

28:18.314 --> 28:19.749
But I'm not dead yet.

28:19.782 --> 28:22.518
And there are more tests
to be passed.

28:22.552 --> 28:25.421
(laughs):
So please... drink up.

28:25.455 --> 28:27.857
-(others laughing)
-Cheers.

28:27.890 --> 28:29.291
-Cheers for us.
-(indistinct chatter)

28:29.325 --> 28:31.327
How can you witches

28:31.361 --> 28:34.096
sit around here
casually sipping wine

28:34.129 --> 28:36.766
when people are going to die?

28:36.799 --> 28:39.369
There's an Antichrist
on the loose,

28:39.402 --> 28:42.204
-trying to destroy the world.
-MYRTLE: Yes,

28:42.237 --> 28:44.440
and let's not forget
who aided in his ascension.

28:44.474 --> 28:46.008
Yeah.

28:46.041 --> 28:47.810
I know.

28:47.843 --> 28:49.945
I'm guilty.

28:49.979 --> 28:52.882
But now we know
what he's capable of.

28:52.915 --> 28:55.818
Madison and I saw firsthand
the people he hurt.

28:55.851 --> 28:57.319
His own family.

28:57.353 --> 28:59.121
Michael was born evil.

28:59.154 --> 29:00.623
We've got to stop him.

29:00.656 --> 29:02.425
And we will.

29:03.726 --> 29:06.061
But tonight we are celebrating.

29:07.597 --> 29:10.566
Because this could be the
last time we'll all be together.

29:14.437 --> 29:16.506
I'm not naive, Behold.

29:16.539 --> 29:20.342
I know damn well
the challenges we're facing.

29:20.376 --> 29:22.612
I've known for some time.

29:25.381 --> 29:29.852
It forced me to do something
I vowed I would never do.

29:30.886 --> 29:33.055
And it almost killed me.

29:47.470 --> 29:49.405
(shuddering)

29:53.609 --> 29:56.111
*

30:05.655 --> 30:08.524
(gasps, pants)

30:08.558 --> 30:11.594
Cinis est anima,

30:11.627 --> 30:15.030
oriri ex igne,

30:15.064 --> 30:17.900
revertere ad me,

30:17.933 --> 30:20.570
revertere ad me!

30:20.603 --> 30:23.473
-(rumbling)
-Revertere ad me!

30:23.506 --> 30:25.140
Reverter...

30:39.354 --> 30:41.691
(grunting weakly)

30:45.461 --> 30:47.630
Cordelia, what have you done?

30:47.663 --> 30:50.933
I gave you strict instructions
not to bring me back.

30:50.966 --> 30:52.602
I know.

30:54.269 --> 30:56.539
But danger is coming.

30:57.707 --> 30:59.775
And I need your guidance.

31:01.176 --> 31:04.714
I don't know how
to protect my girls.

31:06.181 --> 31:07.517
(sobs)

31:09.619 --> 31:11.420
*

31:11.453 --> 31:13.856
(sobbing)

31:13.889 --> 31:17.627
I knew I had to do
everything in my power

31:17.660 --> 31:19.461
to prepare you girls

31:19.495 --> 31:21.463
for what was coming.

31:21.497 --> 31:24.099
And now that we are united

31:24.133 --> 31:26.836
and ready...

31:26.869 --> 31:29.572
it's time to fire
the first shot.

31:31.574 --> 31:34.577
*

31:57.833 --> 31:59.735
(whooshing)

32:16.586 --> 32:18.453
(low rumbling)

32:25.194 --> 32:27.597
John Henry.

32:27.630 --> 32:29.599
What's left of him.

32:30.766 --> 32:33.468
I remember him being taller.

32:34.570 --> 32:35.905
Mallory.

32:35.938 --> 32:40.075
Use your powers
to bring John Henry back to us.

32:42.978 --> 32:44.847
*

32:44.880 --> 32:47.382
(whooshing)

32:51.253 --> 32:53.388
("Nocturne in E-flat Major"
by Frédéric Chopin playing)

32:53.422 --> 32:54.824
(film projector clicking)

32:58.994 --> 33:00.996
*

33:10.906 --> 33:13.008
*

33:38.934 --> 33:40.102
JOHN HENRY:
What I've seen...

33:40.135 --> 33:43.572
what I've learned...

33:43.605 --> 33:45.307
is a matter of life and death.

33:46.842 --> 33:48.844
(coughing)

33:51.681 --> 33:54.216
-It's okay. Just take your time.
-Mm.

33:56.218 --> 33:58.788
We need information
about the night you died.

33:58.821 --> 34:00.790
Who killed you?
Was it Ariel? Baldwin?

34:00.823 --> 34:02.424
What are you talking about?

34:02.457 --> 34:04.459
We know your brothers
conspired against you.

34:04.493 --> 34:07.496
(sighs)

34:11.801 --> 34:14.804
-Weren't they there?
-No, it wasn't them.

34:15.905 --> 34:17.873
I was killed by a woman.

34:19.141 --> 34:20.710
What woman?

34:39.061 --> 34:42.464
(moans)

34:42.497 --> 34:43.933
Shit.

34:44.834 --> 34:46.535
Really?

34:46.568 --> 34:48.704
Not every power is a blessing.

34:48.738 --> 34:50.706
Well.

34:50.740 --> 34:52.674
I have the power
of too much information.

34:52.708 --> 34:54.710
How am I ever gonna eat
another corn dog?

34:54.744 --> 34:55.911
(chuckles)

34:58.380 --> 35:01.116
Power is often
not what it seems.

35:03.786 --> 35:08.190
I suspect your gift
has more to offer.

35:10.392 --> 35:12.561
I need you
to do something for me.

35:12.594 --> 35:14.363
Anything.

35:17.399 --> 35:19.835
Michael has an ally.

35:19.869 --> 35:24.106
Someone who poses
a dangerous threat to our coven.

35:24.139 --> 35:26.942
A traitor.

35:26.976 --> 35:29.745
And she needs to be eliminated.

35:29.779 --> 35:31.847
Wait, you want me to do this?

35:31.881 --> 35:34.950
I'm basically just
a walking nutrition label.

35:34.984 --> 35:37.586
It's not that I am afraid.

35:37.619 --> 35:39.855
I would do anything
for the coven,

35:39.889 --> 35:41.723
but Mallory is much stronger
than I am.

35:41.757 --> 35:43.793
I mean, she's the next Supreme.

35:43.826 --> 35:47.629
Mallory has another part to play
in all this.

35:47.662 --> 35:51.934
I am asking you to do yours.

35:54.970 --> 35:56.972
What do you want me to do?

35:57.006 --> 35:59.108
BUTCHER: Ms. Mead,
what can I do for you?

35:59.141 --> 36:02.744
Give me a pound and a half
of your cheapest cut.

36:02.778 --> 36:05.614
Oh, and a couple
of those cloven hooves

36:05.647 --> 36:07.817
for that satanic zing.

36:10.953 --> 36:13.856
Here's your stew meat.

36:14.990 --> 36:18.027
And, uh, two extra-large hooves.

36:28.437 --> 36:30.739
*

36:30.772 --> 36:31.773
(cart clatters)

36:37.646 --> 36:39.114
(sighs)

36:46.822 --> 36:49.825
I hope you like it hot, bitch,

36:49.859 --> 36:51.526
'cause where you're going...

36:54.663 --> 36:57.666
You dumb heretic.

36:57.699 --> 36:59.634
I saw you following me
in that store.

37:00.802 --> 37:04.073
I'm gonna boil you
in my Crock-Pot, missy.

37:05.740 --> 37:07.676
(grunts)

37:07.709 --> 37:10.145
(muffled shouting)

37:16.218 --> 37:18.220
-Did we get her?
-Yeah.

37:19.922 --> 37:23.125
-Am I gonna die?
-No. You're gonna sleep.

37:23.158 --> 37:24.659
Oh.

37:24.693 --> 37:27.496
Mission accomplished.

37:42.177 --> 37:43.512
BALDWIN:
Mm, mm, mm.

37:43.545 --> 37:45.881
Careful.

37:45.915 --> 37:48.017
It's the deadliest
I've ever created.

37:48.050 --> 37:50.986
I won't bore you
with the ingredients,

37:51.020 --> 37:52.521
but suffice to say this powder

37:52.554 --> 37:54.990
has taken me a lifetime
to perfect.

37:55.024 --> 37:57.927
I'm so happy that we're finally
able to put it to good use.

37:57.960 --> 38:00.562
-Delivery?
-Through the air.

38:00.595 --> 38:03.765
Once inhaled, mere seconds pass

38:03.798 --> 38:06.701
before the cellular walls
inside the body break down.

38:06.735 --> 38:09.371
The victims
will literally bleed out

38:09.404 --> 38:11.740
through their pores.

38:13.208 --> 38:16.545
(coughs) What the fuck?!

38:16.578 --> 38:19.081
-Are you trying to kill me?
-No.

38:19.114 --> 38:23.018
Because it only kills women.

38:23.052 --> 38:24.553
(laughing)

38:26.989 --> 38:29.959
(laughs)

38:29.992 --> 38:32.261
BALDWIN:
This is the magic bullet

38:32.294 --> 38:35.197
we will use
to destroy the witches.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.932
(women coughing)

38:40.002 --> 38:43.572
This is... truly inspired.

38:43.605 --> 38:45.941
Those bitches love to go on

38:45.975 --> 38:48.810
about how a warlock
will never equal one of them.

38:48.843 --> 38:50.579
I wonder what they'd say now

38:50.612 --> 38:52.547
if they saw what you've done.
(chuckles)

38:52.581 --> 38:54.516
CORDELIA:
They'd say it was plagiarism.

38:59.788 --> 39:01.756
Agnes Sampson concocted

39:01.790 --> 39:04.426
the identical formula
back in 1590.

39:04.459 --> 39:06.228
You've just switched around
the genders.

39:06.261 --> 39:08.130
Unfortunately,
Agnes was burned at the stake

39:08.163 --> 39:09.999
before she got a chance
to use it.

39:14.269 --> 39:15.904
Seems you've made
the same mistake.

39:15.937 --> 39:19.241
Cordelia, your powers
have already waned.

39:19.274 --> 39:21.576
Michael will bring...

39:21.610 --> 39:23.412
Perpetuum clausis.

39:23.445 --> 39:25.647
(Ariel and Baldwin grunting)

39:27.816 --> 39:29.818
My powers are waning.

39:30.852 --> 39:32.454
Say it again.

39:34.389 --> 39:35.890
(grunting continues)

39:39.694 --> 39:41.630
*

39:52.574 --> 39:54.176
*

40:14.229 --> 40:16.831
CORDELIA:
Ariel Augustus.

40:16.865 --> 40:19.534
Baldwin Pennypacker.

40:21.270 --> 40:24.706
For the murder of your fellow
warlock, John Henry Moore,

40:24.739 --> 40:28.643
and conspiring to commit treason
against this coven,

40:28.677 --> 40:31.313
I, Cordelia Goode,
on behalf of this council,

40:31.346 --> 40:33.748
sentence you to death by fire.

40:35.184 --> 40:37.086
Our people have long stood
by an agreement

40:37.119 --> 40:40.755
that no witch may kill
a condemned warlock.

40:42.257 --> 40:45.060
Only your brother
may light the flame.

40:45.094 --> 40:48.630
I do not intend to break
with that tradition today.

40:59.241 --> 41:01.310
May I?

41:24.599 --> 41:26.601
*

41:33.908 --> 41:35.610
Any last words?

41:37.179 --> 41:38.547
Ah, right.

41:38.580 --> 41:41.082
You think death is a punishment?

41:41.116 --> 41:43.285
I do not fear the fire.

41:43.318 --> 41:46.155
It cleanses me,

41:46.188 --> 41:48.323
as it will cleanse this world.

41:49.791 --> 41:51.260
I've seen the end.

41:51.293 --> 41:54.496
I bear witness to the darkness.

41:54.529 --> 41:56.765
Father!

41:56.798 --> 42:00.502
Take me in your arms.

42:00.535 --> 42:03.505
Your kingdom is nigh.

42:06.508 --> 42:09.211
(laughs)

42:17.219 --> 42:19.188
(groans)

42:19.221 --> 42:20.989
(muffled screaming)

42:32.334 --> 42:34.736
You don't have to look
if you don't want to.
