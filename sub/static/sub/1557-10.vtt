why mom and I grew apart

[ Sighs ]

15:08.775 --> 15:11.376
I found
a tattoo shop nearby.

15:11.378 --> 15:15.413
It has four stars on yelp,
and it has military discount.

15:15.415 --> 15:18.016
Well, private dorchester

15:18.018 --> 15:20.418
You are just
so helpful tonight, Gloria.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.787
You know what else
you should do?
Another idea.

15:22.789 --> 15:25.423
You should do
mother-and-daughter tattoos,

15:25.425 --> 15:27.792
Like... like, uh,
two halves of a heart.

15:27.794 --> 15:29.427
Or the moon
and some stars.
Oh. Mm.

15:29.429 --> 15:31.863
Or, like,
a bird and a rifle.

Oh, my god,
let's do that!
Yes! Yes!

I mean, not that, but, like,
let's get matching tattoos!

15:36.403 --> 15:38.202
I want to do that
with you.
[ sighs ]

15:38.204 --> 15:39.971
You do?
Yeah!

15:39.973 --> 15:41.539
It could be,
like, our special thing

15:41.541 --> 15:43.608
That we have for the rest
of our lives, just us.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.610
And no matter where we go
or what we do,

15:45.612 --> 15:48.413
When people ask us
about our tattoos,

15:48.415 --> 15:49.380
We can say
that they're from

15:49.382 --> 15:51.482
The best night
of our lives together.

15:51.484 --> 15:53.051
That is so sweet.

I can't believe this,
but I will. I will.

I don't even need
to be cool anymore.

16:10.570 --> 16:11.803
It's like, why?

16:11.805 --> 16:14.439
Yes, exactly. Why?
[ chuckling ] who cares.

16:14.441 --> 16:17.008
Besides, isn't the cooler thing
not caring if you're cool?

16:17.010 --> 16:18.409
Yeah, and if the new cool
is not caring,

16:18.411 --> 16:20.845
Then I'm supercool,
not that I care.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.014
Hey, guys! Guess what.
We're getting matching tattoos.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.416

We need this.

as bert and ernie.

It was supposed to be such
a great moment for me as a dad.

I was gonna
walk into that bar,

into my office

that he got the better price,
