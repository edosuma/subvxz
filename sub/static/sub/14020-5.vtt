00:01.600 --> 00:03.300
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:03.300 --> 00:07.100
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:07.300 --> 00:09.100
the police
who investigate crime

00:09.200 --> 00:11.800
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.900 --> 00:14.000
These are their stories.

00:14.400 --> 00:17.200
A little variety? Would
that be a bad thing?

00:17.400 --> 00:19.300
The Cohens got
a strawberry patch.

00:19.300 --> 00:21.000
You know strawberries
give me the hives.

00:21.100 --> 00:25.500
So forget about strawberries.
Why always asparagus, huh?

00:25.600 --> 00:26.900
Why not potatoes?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.400
Potatoes? Sure. There are lots
of ways to cook potatoes.

00:30.300 --> 00:32.700
Baked, mashed, scalloped,
cottage fries.

00:32.700 --> 00:35.100
Cottage fries?
All that grease.

00:35.200 --> 00:38.500
A man of your age? Are you
looking for a heart attack?

00:39.700 --> 00:40.700
LOU?

00:42.100 --> 00:44.700
I think we better call 911.

00:44.900 --> 00:46.700
White male.
Mid- to late-30s.

00:46.800 --> 00:48.000
When did he cash in?

00:48.100 --> 00:51.400
Way it rained last night, hard to tell.
Eight, 10 hours ago.

00:51.400 --> 00:52.800
So around midnight.

00:54.400 --> 00:56.400
Looks like blunt force
upside the head.

00:56.600 --> 00:58.900
With this. Found it
near the entrance.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.600
Blood on the tip over here.

01:00.700 --> 01:02.400
What's their story?

01:02.400 --> 01:06.400
Oh, grapes of wrath. Co-op garden.
The gate's always open.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.200
And nobody saw
or heard anything.

01:08.300 --> 01:09.800
You're amazing.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.000
What's with his hands?

01:11.100 --> 01:14.600
All scraped up. Wingtips
scratched on the uppers.

01:14.600 --> 01:19.500
Well, he probably landed on the pavement and
got dragged in here sometime last night.

01:19.500 --> 01:23.200
Nice selection of tens and twenties.
Probably not a mugging.

01:23.800 --> 01:26.700
Martin Felder,
13 East 82nd Street.

01:26.700 --> 01:28.200
New York Bar Association.

01:28.200 --> 01:30.000
The guy's a lawyer.
Hmm.

01:29.900 --> 01:32.600
I'll be in mourning
for the next five minutes.

01:32.700 --> 01:37.200
East Side Athletic Club. Friends of Lincoln Center.
Metropolitan Museum.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.800
Should have joined the
Horticultural Society.

01:41.000 --> 01:47.074

02:30.600 --> 02:32.300
He was working at the office.

02:32.400 --> 02:34.900
He called say that he was
going to be very late,

02:35.000 --> 02:37.200
so I just went to bed.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.000
He do that often?
Work late?

02:39.200 --> 02:42.800
Yes. He's hardly had
a day off since the spring.

02:44.200 --> 02:46.200
We didn't even
take our vacation.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.400
What was he working on?
I don't know.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.400
Look in his briefcase.

02:51.700 --> 02:52.900
We didn't find a briefcase.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.900
Well, he always
had it with him.

02:57.000 --> 03:00.100
Did he, uh, have any enemies?

03:00.200 --> 03:03.100
Any money problems?
Anything of that nature?

03:03.200 --> 03:06.400
No. Martin was
a very sweet man.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.300
Anything job-related,
like an unhappy client?

03:11.800 --> 03:15.900
No. The only unhappy
person at work was Martin.

03:15.800 --> 03:16.900
ED: How's that?

03:16.900 --> 03:20.100
It was all corporate
work. He hated it.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.100
But he couldn't afford to quit.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.500
He wanted so much
to make a difference.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Marty ran our due diligence
team. He was indispensable.

03:32.000 --> 03:33.900
No one could collate
contracts like him.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.600
Do you know what he was
collating on West 31st?

03:36.600 --> 03:39.400
I wish I knew. This could all be
very embarrassing for the firm.

03:39.500 --> 03:41.300
Not to mention his family.

03:41.600 --> 03:44.900
Was Felder the type to get himself
in embarrassing situations?

03:44.900 --> 03:47.000
If he was, he wouldn't
have been working here.

03:46.900 --> 03:48.600
Right. Uh, Mr. Curry,

03:48.700 --> 03:49.700
if you don't mind,

03:49.800 --> 03:52.800
we'd like to see every piece
of business he was working on.

03:52.900 --> 03:56.100
Besides the fact it's all privileged,
we do mergers and acquisitions.

03:56.100 --> 03:59.500
Far as I know, no one's ever
been killed because of an IPO.

03:59.500 --> 04:02.600
Well, not literally. I'm sorry, I
have to make a conference call.

04:03.700 --> 04:05.300
He had the briefcase
with him when he left.

04:05.300 --> 04:06.300
When was that?

04:06.400 --> 04:08.000
8:30, thereabouts.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.500
He said he had
a business meeting.

04:09.600 --> 04:11.300
He didn't tell me
what it was in regards to.

04:11.300 --> 04:12.900
Would it be in his daytimer?

04:12.900 --> 04:15.200
He usually carried
that in his briefcase.

04:15.500 --> 04:17.700
I didn't schedule the meeting,
so I don't have a record of it.

04:17.800 --> 04:19.100
But you're sure
it was business.

04:19.100 --> 04:22.600
Yes. Mr. Felder was about work.
It was always about work.

04:22.800 --> 04:26.500
He billed 80,90 hours a week. More
than anyone else at the firm.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.800
We're going to need whatever
personal papers are in here.

04:28.900 --> 04:30.300
I'll get you a box.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.300
I'm starting to think Felder
whacked himself over the head.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.400
If I had his life,
I might kill myself.

04:36.500 --> 04:38.600
Or find some very
creative hobbies.

04:39.300 --> 04:41.400
I don't see how he paid
for any hobbies.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.300
Barely any cash
in his own account,

04:43.300 --> 04:45.800
his wife wrote all the checks.
Guy was on a short leash.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.300
I write all the checks
in my house.

04:47.400 --> 04:52.400
Felder charged a rental car to his personal
credit card five, six, seven times

04:52.300 --> 04:55.000
in the last two months.
Always on a weekday.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.400
On a weekday?

04:56.400 --> 04:59.100
Guess he found some
time to stretch that leash.

05:00.100 --> 05:03.100
Mr. Felder always took a
mid-size, same-day return.

05:03.300 --> 05:06.200
Eight rentals in two months.
Last one on Monday.

05:06.200 --> 05:09.500
Day before he was killed. Did Felder
happen to say where he was going?

05:09.700 --> 05:10.700
No.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.200
Oh, here's something.

05:12.300 --> 05:15.600
Two weeks ago he had a breakdown on the
road and had to switch out to another car.

05:15.600 --> 05:18.300
Where? Uh, he dealt with
our branch in Clinton.

05:19.100 --> 05:23.200
Doesn't the Department of Corrections
also have a branch in Clinton?

05:23.500 --> 05:27.300
Felder had a client at the
Clinton Correctional Facility.

05:27.500 --> 05:29.400
Death row inmate,
Stephen Dupree.

05:29.500 --> 05:31.800
He was his handling
his appeal pro bono.

05:31.800 --> 05:34.200
Dupree. Sounds familiar.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.800
He beat a woman to death during
a home robbery four years ago.

05:37.900 --> 05:39.600
Her name was Dana Hagen.

05:39.600 --> 05:42.600
Right. I remember the husband
ran a software company.

05:42.700 --> 05:45.200
He wanted the guy crucified,
and he was not shy about it.

05:45.200 --> 05:48.000
Well, the crucifixion's been
delayed for the umpteenth time.

05:48.100 --> 05:50.600
Dupree got a stay
and filed for a new trial.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.300
His bad luck his lawyer's dead.

05:52.300 --> 05:55.300
Might not be luck.
This Dupree's a piece work.

05:55.800 --> 05:59.300
When the verdict came down he attacked
his attorney in the courtroom.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.700
Then he got a new lawyer who quit
after Dupree threatened him.

06:03.200 --> 06:05.100
He doesn't handle
bad news very well.

06:05.200 --> 06:08.100
Well, if his appeal
wasn't going his way,

06:08.100 --> 06:11.500
getting rid of Felder could stall
the needle a few more years.

06:11.700 --> 06:12.700
He put out a hit?

06:15.000 --> 06:17.600
What do you mean, he's dead?

06:17.700 --> 06:19.500
He was murdered in
the city three days ago.

06:19.600 --> 06:20.800
No.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.400
This can't be happening to me.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.700
It's not.
It happened to Felder.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.100
No, I mean, Felder said
he was getting new evidence.

06:28.100 --> 06:30.100
He said he had a shot
of getting me out of here.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.300
What new evidence? I don't know.
Just check his files.

06:33.200 --> 06:35.400
The police didn't find any
files pertaining to you.

06:35.500 --> 06:37.900
Oh, man, what am I gonna do?

06:38.800 --> 06:42.100
You're gonna get yourself
another lawyer, another stay,

06:42.100 --> 06:43.400
another year or two will go by,

06:43.500 --> 06:45.700
which was the whole point
of having Felder killed.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.900
What are you talking about?

06:48.500 --> 06:52.100
You have a bad track record with lawyers
who don't tell you what you want to hear.

06:52.200 --> 06:54.900
No way.
Felder knew I'm innocent.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.700
He said he was on
a mission to save my life.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.500
Why would I want him dead?

07:03.100 --> 07:06.500
New evidence, Abbie? Favorite
fantasy of the appellate advocate.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.100
What was Felder doing exactly?

07:08.200 --> 07:10.000
Being a pain in the ass.

07:10.000 --> 07:12.300
He subpoenaed any police
files on a Michael Gordon

07:12.400 --> 07:14.300
as they related
to the Hagen murder.

07:14.300 --> 07:16.100
Who's Michael Gordon?
According to Felder,

07:16.100 --> 07:18.200
some kind of bad number
who could clear his client.

07:18.600 --> 07:20.600
And according to you?
Pure smoke.

07:20.700 --> 07:24.000
There's no mention of any Michael
Gordon in the murder file.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.900
The appeal was a loser, Abbie.
Same as Dupree.

07:26.900 --> 07:28.800
The husband saw him walking
away from the townhouse,

07:28.900 --> 07:30.500
even picked him
out of a line-up.

07:30.600 --> 07:32.100
Now, I'm sorry about Felder.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.000
I'm even sorrier Dupree is
going to be breathing our air

07:34.100 --> 07:36.600
a couple of more years
because of this.

07:37.500 --> 07:41.600
In New York State alone there are over 100
Michael Gordons with a criminal record.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.200
Felder's subpoena didn't give any
more information about Gordon?

07:44.400 --> 07:45.900
Just that
he's an ex-con.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.600
You didn't find Felder's
files on Dupree?

07:47.700 --> 07:49.800
No. Could be in
the missing briefcase.

07:49.700 --> 07:52.100
Could be why he was killed
in the first place.

07:52.200 --> 07:55.400
If he had information that implicated
Gordon in a woman's murder...

07:55.500 --> 07:58.400
How did a corporate lawyer like
Felder find a lowlife like Gordon?

07:58.500 --> 08:00.600
P.I.
Paid by who?

08:00.700 --> 08:04.000
We went over Felder's financials, and
sure as hell Dupree didn't foot the bill.

08:04.200 --> 08:06.700
Well, maybe Felder's
law firm did.

08:11.000 --> 08:13.000
Felder stuck his law firm
for my bill, huh?

08:13.100 --> 08:15.300
I love it! Gotta give him
an "atta boy" for that.

08:15.400 --> 08:17.100
Yeah, well it'll have
to be in the next life.

08:17.200 --> 08:19.200
Felder was murdered Tuesday.

08:19.300 --> 08:20.800
No kidding.

08:20.900 --> 08:24.800
Geez, you spend a week in Pompano
and everything turns to hell.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.000
Oh!

08:26.900 --> 08:28.700
What kind of work
did you do for Felder?

08:29.500 --> 08:32.299
He had an appeal on
a robbery-homicide.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.200
I know some people in that
world, so I made some inquiries.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.200
What'd you turn up?
A name.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.100
Michael Gordon.

08:40.900 --> 08:43.799
He unloaded some swag from
a robbery at the time.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.000
Where can we find him?

08:45.100 --> 08:46.600
If I knew that, I would
have told Felder.

08:46.600 --> 08:48.000
Well, where'd you
hear about Gordon?

08:48.200 --> 08:50.000
From the widow
of Max Bronstein.

08:50.000 --> 08:52.100
Max ran a fence
in the West Forties

08:52.200 --> 08:53.900
till the cancer
got him a year ago.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.900
You know about the, uh, phone
calls that Felder got?

08:57.500 --> 08:58.800
No, we don't.

08:58.800 --> 09:01.000
Last week, Felder got a
call on his cell phone

09:01.100 --> 09:03.400
threatening him if he didn't
back off the appeal.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.400
You check into it?

09:04.500 --> 09:08.100
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got the IUDs
from the phone company, with no joy.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.200
Call came from
a pay phone, Midtown.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.200
Thanks.
Hey.

09:12.800 --> 09:15.200
We don't give out our
subscribers' numbers to anybody.

09:15.200 --> 09:18.400
They pay for every call they get, so
naturally they don't want unsolicited ones.

09:18.300 --> 09:21.800
So the junk mail I get for special
offers for cell phone users,

09:21.900 --> 09:23.200
who gave them my name?

09:23.200 --> 09:26.600
Well, we do sell our subscriber list to companies.
It's standard practice.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.400
Those lists include
the phone numbers?

09:28.500 --> 09:30.800
Yes, but they're contractually
precluded from calling.

09:31.000 --> 09:33.300
Who'd you sell the list to lately?
Let's see.

09:38.700 --> 09:40.700
Two marketing firms
and a software company.

09:40.800 --> 09:42.100
What software company?

09:42.100 --> 09:43.700
Hagen Software.

09:44.100 --> 09:46.600
As in the husband
of the late Dana Hagen.

09:50.600 --> 09:52.000
We design smart cards
for cell phones,

09:52.000 --> 09:55.200
so of course we buy mailing lists.
It's not illegal.

09:55.300 --> 09:58.500
One of the names you bought was Martin Felder.
Ever hear of him?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.700
No. Why? Who is he?

10:01.800 --> 10:05.700
He's a lawyer. He was filing
an appeal for Steven Dupree

10:05.700 --> 10:08.800
before he was killed last Tuesday.
Name ring a bell now?

10:09.100 --> 10:10.800
Not his name. No.

10:10.900 --> 10:13.600
He got Dupree
a stay of execution.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.800
Did you know that?
I didn't know.

10:17.700 --> 10:21.100
You don't remember Victims'
Assistance calling you to tell you

10:21.100 --> 10:24.600
that Felder filed a new appeal for the
son of a bitch who killed your wife?

10:24.600 --> 10:27.100
ED: You don't remember calling
Felder from a phone booth

10:27.200 --> 10:29.300
around the corner
from your office?

10:31.200 --> 10:36.100
You've been waiting four years
to see this dirtbag put down.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.200
We can imagine how that feels.
No, you can't.

10:38.300 --> 10:41.900
Somebody you love gets killed.
The only way you can stay sane

10:41.900 --> 10:44.800
is to think about what's gonna
happen to the bastard who did it.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.900
Anybody who gets in the way,
like some smart lawyer...

10:47.000 --> 10:49.200
All right! All
right, I called him.

10:50.500 --> 10:51.900
I was angry.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.700
That animal, Dupree,
killed my wife.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.300
I passed him on the street.

11:02.400 --> 11:04.000
He was coming from our home.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.800
He killed my Dana.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.700
Four years I've waited.

11:13.900 --> 11:16.500
Mr. Hagen, what you did
to Felder, we can...

11:16.500 --> 11:18.400
I didn't do anything
to that man.

11:18.400 --> 11:20.000
I called him.
That's all I did.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.500
What were you doing
Monday night?

11:23.600 --> 11:25.500
I was in my office
with two of my colleagues

11:25.500 --> 11:27.800
talking to my supplier
in Manila.

11:27.700 --> 11:29.800
BRISCOE:
We're gonna check on that.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.700
Dupree?

11:34.700 --> 11:37.900
I would kill that man
with my bare hands.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.400
But Felder?
Please.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.700
What would be the point?

11:43.200 --> 11:46.100
Hagen was on an online conference
call to the Philippines.

11:46.100 --> 11:48.200
The whole thing was
recorded by webcam.

11:48.300 --> 11:50.500
Back to the mysterious
Michael Gordon.

11:50.600 --> 11:51.800
If he killed Dana Hagen,

11:51.900 --> 11:53.100
he has motive to kill Felder.

11:53.100 --> 11:56.200
Whoa, whoa. Dana Hagen was
killed by Steven Dupree.

11:56.300 --> 11:58.300
Why don't we start
by finding Gordon?

11:58.500 --> 12:00.100
Gordon's a ghost.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.600
I know you know
who prosecuted Dupree.

12:03.300 --> 12:04.400
Andy Wolinsky.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.900
Judge Wolinsky.

12:06.200 --> 12:10.400
The cops go after suspects that don't
exist, Dupree's next lawyer is gonna talk

12:10.400 --> 12:13.000
the Appellate Court into
giving him a new trial.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.100
And then, my friends, there will be
enough brownie sandwiches to go around.

12:17.200 --> 12:20.000
We'll handle this
on the QT for now.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.700
Just Abbie and
Lieutenant Van Buren.

12:23.100 --> 12:25.500
You're the Executive
A.D.A., Jack.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.500
It's entirely your call.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.700
(DOOR OPENING)

12:31.700 --> 12:34.700
So, what's the first step?
(DOOR CLOSING)

12:34.700 --> 12:37.400
There's the widow of the fence who
saw Gordon with the stolen goods,

12:37.400 --> 12:40.400
but she left for Arizona the day
after Felder was found dead.

12:40.400 --> 12:42.500
She won't return our calls.

12:42.900 --> 12:45.500
So we convene a grand jury
and issue a subpoena.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.400
I never heard
of this Michael Gordon.

12:49.500 --> 12:51.800
Those people,
Max knew them. I didn't.

12:51.800 --> 12:53.800
That's not what you told
the private detective.

12:53.700 --> 12:56.300
(LAUGHS) When I was drinking!
Whatever I talked about,

12:56.400 --> 12:58.300
I didn't know what
I was talking about.

12:58.900 --> 12:59.900
Are you afraid of Gordon?

13:00.700 --> 13:03.700
Please, I just want to get back
to my grandkids in Tucson.

13:04.800 --> 13:07.200
How long do you think it's going
to take Gordon to figure out

13:07.200 --> 13:08.900
who told Felder about him?

13:10.100 --> 13:12.700
We're the only people
who can protect you.

13:17.200 --> 13:20.200
After that woman was killed,

13:20.200 --> 13:22.900
Max saw it the paper
that this kid, Dupree,

13:22.900 --> 13:24.500
was arrested for the job.

13:25.600 --> 13:27.200
He said the kid didn't do it.

13:27.800 --> 13:30.900
Max never discussed his work.
But this, this he told me.

13:31.900 --> 13:34.100
He said it was this other guy.

13:34.200 --> 13:36.300
This Mike Gordon.

13:36.400 --> 13:38.100
How did your husband know?

13:39.100 --> 13:42.500
He met Gordon at the Blarney
Stone, over on 42nd.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.800
That's where he did business.

13:44.800 --> 13:48.000
And Gordon sold him some jewelry
from this woman's house.

13:48.000 --> 13:52.000
I told Max, I told him, he should
have told the cops when they come by.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.200
But Max said that
Gordon would kill us.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.900
What cops came by?

13:58.200 --> 14:00.900
The ones that were investigating
that woman's murder.

14:01.900 --> 14:05.100
Somebody gave them a tip
that Max knew something.

14:11.000 --> 14:14.300
The Hagen file has a notation the
investigators talked to Max Bronstein,

14:14.400 --> 14:16.500
but there is no report
on the interview,

14:16.500 --> 14:18.800
no follow-up,
no mention of a tip.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.400
Because Ms. Carmichael,
there was no tip.

14:21.800 --> 14:24.900
Judge Wolinsky, the widow was there when
Detective Simpson questioned her husband.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.700
One of the first things
I learned as an A.D.A.,

14:27.800 --> 14:30.400
right after I figured out where
to order my pastrami on rye,

14:30.400 --> 14:32.700
was that witnesses
make mistakes.

14:32.900 --> 14:35.700
Especially about events that
occurred four years ago.

14:37.100 --> 14:38.500
And Michael Gordon?

14:38.600 --> 14:40.700
I don't know if
he killed Martin Felder.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.800
I do know who
killed Dana Hagen.

14:42.900 --> 14:44.800
I prosecuted that gentleman,

14:44.800 --> 14:46.800
and he's sitting on death row.

14:49.700 --> 14:52.200
I talked to Max. He absolutely
had nothing to do with a tip.

14:52.400 --> 14:53.900
I hit every fence I could find.

14:53.800 --> 14:55.200
None of them knew squat.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.100
Did Michael Gordon's
name ever come up?

14:58.200 --> 15:02.400
Look, it's Abbie, right? We got the
guy who killed Hagen, no question.

15:02.600 --> 15:06.400
Dupree even offered to confess if we
took the death penalty off the table.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.200
Then I don't understand,
Detective Simpson.

15:08.200 --> 15:09.900
Why is he sitting on death row?

15:10.000 --> 15:14.300
Wolinsky turned him down. With what we had
on him, we didn't need his confession.

15:16.700 --> 15:19.600
If the lead A.D.A. and the primary
detective say there was no tip...

15:19.600 --> 15:21.500
This was a big case, wasn't it?

15:21.400 --> 15:25.600
A woman beaten to death by a stranger
in her Upper East Side home.

15:25.700 --> 15:27.400
Those guys must have
had their hands full.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.500
Michael Gordon just
fell through the cracks?

15:29.500 --> 15:30.900
Well, I'm not saying
someone goofed.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.700
For all we know, Gordon just
fenced the goods for Dupree.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.700
But until we find him...

15:37.100 --> 15:38.200
Go with God.

15:39.700 --> 15:43.300
I have sheets on every Michael
Gordon in the Tri-State area

15:43.300 --> 15:46.200
with a burglary-related
conviction in last 10 years.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.800
Twenty-three names.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.200
But six of them were doing time
when Dana Hagen was killed,

15:50.200 --> 15:51.200
and two more are dead.

15:51.600 --> 15:53.100
Oh, well, that narrows it down.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.200
Max Bronstein worked out
of a Blarney Stone on 42nd.

15:56.200 --> 15:59.200
Maybe there are some bartenders
there with a good memory for faces.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.900
Yeah, I remember Max. Uh, club
soda when he was working.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.700
Seven-and-seven when
he wasn't. Good tipper.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.200
Bookie right?
A fence.

16:08.500 --> 16:11.600
Really? Five years the guy sat
at my bar, I never knew that.

16:11.700 --> 16:12.700
He in trouble?

16:12.700 --> 16:15.400
Not with us. He died
of cancer last year.

16:15.500 --> 16:16.500
Oh.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.500
I need you to look
at a few pictures.

16:19.800 --> 16:22.000
You ever see any of
these guys with Max?

16:22.200 --> 16:24.500
No face that jumps out at me.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.300
Gordon. Michael Gordon.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.500
Lot of Mikes.

16:28.400 --> 16:29.400
Him I know.

16:29.400 --> 16:30.400
You sure?

16:30.600 --> 16:33.400
Yeah. He and Maxie did
business a couple times.

16:34.000 --> 16:35.500
How long ago?

16:35.600 --> 16:38.600
Ooh. Around the time
the Rangers got Gretzky.

16:38.600 --> 16:40.400
Yeah. Four years ago?

16:41.800 --> 16:46.100
Nice set of lock picks, Mike.
Honed by years of use.

16:47.800 --> 16:49.800
And this little pry bar,
this is nice.

16:49.900 --> 16:51.400
I've been looking
for one just like it.

16:51.400 --> 16:52.900
Where'd you buy it?

16:53.100 --> 16:54.600
I'm gonna wait on my lawyer.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.200
What's he gonna tell you
you don't already know?

16:59.300 --> 17:03.000
This is a parole violation. You're going
back upstate to finish your stretch.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.599
And that's just for openers.

17:04.599 --> 17:06.700
We're putting together
a murder case against you.

17:06.700 --> 17:08.099
Maybe two.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.800
You recognize these people?
You should.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.599
You killed him to cover up
the fact that you killed her.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.200
I didn't kill anybody.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.400
ED: This is from the burglary
at the lady's house.

17:17.599 --> 17:19.400
Dana Hagen,
if you don't remember.

17:19.500 --> 17:23.800
The twist of the alarm wires, three turns,
bent on the side. That's your signature, Mike.

17:23.800 --> 17:25.400
The same with all
your other burglaries.

17:25.500 --> 17:27.599
I know four guys
do it the same way.

17:28.900 --> 17:31.700
I said, I'm gonna
wait on my lawyer.

17:35.000 --> 17:37.300
Forensics went through
Gordon's shoes and clothes.

17:37.300 --> 17:39.700
No blood splatters, no mud
from the tomato patch.

17:39.700 --> 17:42.300
Okay. Start pulling in
Gordon's associates.

17:42.300 --> 17:45.000
Maybe he told them
about Hagen and Felder.

17:45.900 --> 17:49.000
Hey, Abbie, we might be able
to put both bodies on Gordon.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.500
His usual M.O. matches
the Hagen burglary.

17:51.700 --> 17:54.400
He show any signs he might want to talk?
Not yet, but...

17:56.300 --> 17:57.300
Jamie.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.900
Hi.
Hey, look at you.

18:01.100 --> 18:03.300
Hey, Lieutenant. How are you?
Never better.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.200
Uh, this is Abbie Carmichael.

18:05.100 --> 18:07.600
Yes, I've heard of you. Jamie Ross.
I've heard of you, too.

18:07.800 --> 18:10.100
So, what brings you here?

18:10.500 --> 18:11.500
Work.

18:13.300 --> 18:14.300
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

18:15.800 --> 18:17.700
Hey, you.
Hello, Detective.

18:18.300 --> 18:19.600
What, are you back
with the D.A.s?

18:19.700 --> 18:22.000
No, Ms. Ross is
Mr. Gordon's lawyer.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.200
ROSS: You've been
talking to my client?

18:25.400 --> 18:26.500
Talking at him.

18:26.700 --> 18:28.800
Hadn't he invoked
his right to counsel?

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
ROSS: Aside from the parole violation, are
there any other charges on the table?

18:33.000 --> 18:34.700
Not at this time.

18:34.700 --> 18:38.500
Well, then I'd like a word with my client,
and you can book him for arraignment.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.900
I don't understand.
I did this four years ago.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.900
We realize it's upsetting.

18:51.000 --> 18:52.100
Upsetting?

18:53.500 --> 18:55.000
It's incomprehensible.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.500
Everyone already knows
who killed my wife.

18:59.100 --> 19:01.100
Please, Mr. Hagen,
we need your cooperation.

19:10.600 --> 19:11.900
You recognize someone?

19:12.100 --> 19:13.600
Ms. Carmichael.

19:14.100 --> 19:16.500
I don't recognize anybody.
It's not any of them.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.600
Can I go now?

19:21.200 --> 19:22.400
Yes, thank you.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.100
Don't be shy. Next time,
just point to my client.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.200
(SIGHING)

19:37.400 --> 19:39.400
CARMICHAEL: He reacted
when he saw Gordon.

19:39.900 --> 19:42.400
It might have dawned on him he
made a mistake four years ago.

19:42.400 --> 19:43.900
Doesn't matter.

19:44.100 --> 19:45.900
Jamie won't give him
another bite at the apple.

19:45.900 --> 19:47.700
How'd she end up
representing Gordon anyhow?

19:47.900 --> 19:49.200
I thought she was teaching.

19:49.200 --> 19:52.400
Well, he's a holdover from before
she joined the D.A.'s office.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.100
He called her, and I guess
she felt some obligation.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.900
She would.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.800
What's the rest
of the case against Gordon?

19:58.900 --> 20:03.200
The similar M.O., the bartender's
I.D., and Max Bronstein's widow.

20:04.200 --> 20:06.000
Coincidence,
circumstance and hearsay.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.700
Enough for an indictment.

20:08.700 --> 20:11.400
Get it. I'll talk
to Jamie about a plea.

20:11.800 --> 20:13.900
Life without parole,
both counts.

20:14.300 --> 20:16.300
The needle stays in the bag.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.400
If you had convincing
evidence on either count,

20:18.400 --> 20:22.200
you wouldn't hesitate to put an upstanding
citizen like Michael Gordon on death row.

20:22.500 --> 20:24.000
Is that a no?

20:24.100 --> 20:27.200
It's an "I'll discuss it with my
client, but I won't recommend it."

20:27.700 --> 20:29.500
The offer won't hold forever.

20:29.800 --> 20:32.800
Once it's gone, you know better than
anybody I'll do everything I can

20:32.800 --> 20:34.600
to strap Gordon to a gurney.

20:34.800 --> 20:37.400
I know what
"everything I can" means.

20:37.900 --> 20:41.000
Then you can impress on your client
that he's dealing with a junkyard dog.

20:41.000 --> 20:42.700
This isn't a team effort, Jack.

20:42.800 --> 20:44.900
I'm not an A.D.A.
anymore.

20:45.700 --> 20:46.700
Uh-huh.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.200
Kosovo?

20:52.900 --> 20:54.700
Yes, this little girl's
father and three brothers

20:54.800 --> 20:57.100
were found in a mass grave
outside Prestina.

20:57.200 --> 21:00.700
We just turned in our final report to
the War Crimes Tribunal last week.

21:01.100 --> 21:02.500
Tough work.

21:03.100 --> 21:06.400
Well, Adam used to say, you clean up
the world one lousy brick at a time.

21:06.700 --> 21:09.700
Michael Gordon's what you
find hiding under the bricks.

21:11.000 --> 21:13.400
You could have fobbed him
off on somebody else.

21:13.500 --> 21:16.600
Some 18-B panel hack?
Not on a capital case.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.400
Well, you'll have something to
talk about with your students.

21:19.600 --> 21:21.200
Let me know
about the plea offer.

21:22.500 --> 21:24.000
End of business day tomorrow.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.500
Have you told Steven Dupree
you have another suspect?

21:26.900 --> 21:27.900
Not yet.

21:28.300 --> 21:30.300
No sense getting his hopes up.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.400
Especially since you might
have to kill him anyway.

21:36.500 --> 21:40.000
Jamie called me back. Her guy won't deal.
You talk to Eric Hagen?

21:40.100 --> 21:43.300
Yeah, he won't budge from his original I.D.
It's Dupree all the way.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.800
Better safe than sorry.
What's all this?

21:46.800 --> 21:49.100
I pulled the complete
Hagen file out of storage.

21:49.200 --> 21:51.300
It was worth
the allergy attack.

21:51.500 --> 21:56.000
Memo from the Bronx, Property Recovery
Unit, Detective Wesley Simpson.

21:56.400 --> 21:59.900
"Please advise regarding disposition
of one white platinum bracelet"

21:59.800 --> 22:01.000
"engraved, 'Love forever'."

22:01.400 --> 22:05.300
List of property stolen from
the Hagen home. Line 12.

22:09.100 --> 22:12.300
One platinum bracelet,
inscription, "Love forever."

22:15.800 --> 22:17.300
Where was the bracelet found?

22:17.300 --> 22:20.300
During a vice squad sweep of
Hunts Point four years ago.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.400
It's been in the Bronx in a
property room ever since.

22:23.800 --> 22:26.300
Anybody find out how
it ended up in Hunts Point?

22:26.200 --> 22:30.200
No indications Detective Simpson or
anyone else followed up on that memo.

22:31.800 --> 22:33.500
Time somebody did.

22:34.300 --> 22:38.000
Yeah, I used to work the Point,
about two lifetimes before this.

22:38.300 --> 22:40.600
You remember being arrested
there four years ago?

22:40.700 --> 22:43.800
You seen my sheet, right? Think you
could keep track of all those busts?

22:43.800 --> 22:45.200
I sure as hell can't.

22:46.600 --> 22:49.600
Jasmine, you're on awaiting
list for a methadone program.

22:49.700 --> 22:51.600
I can get you moved to
the front of that line.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.400
You were arrested
with this bracelet.

22:57.700 --> 23:01.500
Yeah, Mack named Bernard gave it to me.
Some silver-plated crap.

23:02.100 --> 23:04.100
Actually, it was
solid platinum.

23:04.100 --> 23:05.200
No kidding.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.000
Do you know where he got it?

23:07.100 --> 23:09.700
Yeah, from Fat Maxie at a
bar over on Forty-Deuce.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.400
The Blarney Stone.
That one.

23:12.600 --> 23:15.300
The cops who arrested you,
did they ask where you got it?

23:15.400 --> 23:16.800
Yeah, Fat Maxie
what I told 'em.

23:17.700 --> 23:21.700
The bracelet was recovered from the
girl three weeks into Dupree's trial.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.200
You'd already rested your case.

23:24.300 --> 23:25.900
We didn't know
about the bracelet.

23:26.700 --> 23:28.700
The memo about it
was in the file.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.500
The bracelet
corroborated the tip.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.500
Again with this tip.

23:33.400 --> 23:37.300
Andy, we're not alleging
any malfeasance here.

23:37.300 --> 23:38.600
I should hope not.

23:38.600 --> 23:40.300
JACK: This was
a high-profile case.

23:41.500 --> 23:43.600
Death penalty, long hours.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.600
You were invested in
getting Dupree convicted.

23:46.700 --> 23:50.600
My God, Jack, the guy was arrested in
a bar three blocks from the scene.

23:50.800 --> 23:54.600
He was ready to confess. There was
no mistake here, no dereliction.

23:56.500 --> 23:59.100
Whatever happened,
now's the time to undo it.

24:00.800 --> 24:02.200
There's nothing to undo.

24:02.300 --> 24:05.300
Forget that an innocent mean
might be sitting on death row.

24:05.400 --> 24:07.700
Michael Gordon could get
away with two murders.

24:07.700 --> 24:09.900
We need you to confirm
the prostitute's story

24:09.800 --> 24:12.100
and to confirm you had
the tip about Max Bronstein.

24:12.300 --> 24:18.000
These allegations are crap. Dana Hagen
was killed by Steven Dupree, period.

24:18.700 --> 24:19.900
Now, get out.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.000
I put that creep up for office.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.300
This tip,

24:30.900 --> 24:32.800
maybe you ought to find
out where it came from?

24:33.500 --> 24:34.900
After four years?

24:35.000 --> 24:36.300
Four years, four days.

24:36.400 --> 24:39.800
Find the tipster, find a
witness against Mr. Gordon.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.300
From the Department
of Correction.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.600
Gordon's cellmates,
four years ago.

24:46.300 --> 24:49.000
He was at Rikers awaiting
trial on a larceny charge.

24:49.000 --> 24:52.800
What I can't figure out is if
someone wanted to rat out Gordon,

24:52.900 --> 24:55.200
why tip the police
about Max Bronstein?

24:56.400 --> 24:59.700
Maybe they didn't know about Gordon. Maybe
they just knew Bronstein was fencing goods

24:59.700 --> 25:00.900
from the Hagen murder.

25:01.100 --> 25:03.100
I don't think it's something
Bronstein would have bragged about.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.700
Everyone said he was discrete.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.300
Maybe Gordon wasn't.

25:06.800 --> 25:09.900
Then back to my original question.
Why not drop the dime on Gordon?

25:14.100 --> 25:16.100
Maybe they had no choice.

25:19.400 --> 25:22.400
Here you go. The complete
works of Dupree, Steven,

25:22.500 --> 25:24.200
from arraignment to appeals.

25:24.300 --> 25:26.700
Gonna take a little longer
to get the trial transcripts.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.200
All I need is
the sign-out sheet.

25:30.100 --> 25:32.000
It was last signed out
two weeks ago.

25:32.100 --> 25:34.100
It should This go
back four years?

25:47.900 --> 25:49.200
Jamie,

25:50.200 --> 25:51.600
can I have a word?

25:52.100 --> 25:53.800
Hey, Katie, you remember
Mommy's friend, Jack?

25:54.000 --> 25:55.100
Hi, Katie.

25:55.200 --> 25:57.600
Just go on up the steps, and
I'll meet you in a second.

25:58.100 --> 26:00.600
Jack, you look terrible.
What, you sleep in that suit?

26:00.800 --> 26:02.600
You tipped off Andy Wolinsky.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.100
What are you talking about?

26:04.500 --> 26:06.800
Four years ago, you were Gordon's
lawyer on a larceny case.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.000
Somehow, you found out
he killed Dana Hagen.

26:09.000 --> 26:11.100
You had an ethical problem.
You couldn't turn him in.

26:11.100 --> 26:12.400
Jack... You did the
next best thing.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.500
You pointed the police
at his fence,

26:15.600 --> 26:17.100
which should have led
them straight to Gordon.

26:17.200 --> 26:19.700
I cannot discuss... You know
the wrong man's on death row.

26:23.500 --> 26:27.200
Two weeks after you joined the D.A.'s
office you signed out Dupree's file.

26:27.300 --> 26:29.100
What were you doing, checking
the status of his appeal?

26:29.200 --> 26:30.500
I can't have this
conversation with you.

26:30.600 --> 26:31.900
You know Gordon did it,
don't you?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.200
You know it for a fact.

26:33.300 --> 26:36.200
You're gonna stand by and watch Steven
Dupree die for a murder he didn't commit?

26:36.100 --> 26:37.100
Goodbye, Jack.

26:37.200 --> 26:39.500
Jamie, for God's sake, you cared
then, don't you care now?

26:47.000 --> 26:48.500
We found the source of the tip.

26:48.900 --> 26:51.100
That'd be quite a feat,
since I never got a tip.

26:51.300 --> 26:53.700
I can't reveal the name, but
suffice it to say it's a woman.

26:53.700 --> 26:55.000
Another junkie prostitute?

26:55.100 --> 26:58.100
Her credibility's above reproach.
Andy, I'm giving you a chance.

26:58.100 --> 27:00.900
You come after me, you make sure
you don't leave me standing.

27:00.900 --> 27:03.900
I will use the full power
of my office to bury you.

27:12.000 --> 27:15.000
We can't turn this corner unless
Jamie tells us what she knows.

27:15.200 --> 27:18.300
We assume she can't because of attorney-client
privilege. Her hands are tied.

27:18.400 --> 27:19.500
Are they?

27:20.300 --> 27:22.000
I want you to call her.

27:22.100 --> 27:23.700
Set up a meeting with Gordon.

27:25.900 --> 27:27.000
Where's my client?

27:27.000 --> 27:29.600
In the conference room.
I think we should talk first.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.300
I'm going to make
Gordon a final offer.

27:33.900 --> 27:37.000
25-to-life on both
murder counts.

27:37.500 --> 27:38.700
I'll discuss it.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.600
I want you to recommend it.
Based on what?

27:41.900 --> 27:44.500
On the fact that we have
an ironclad case against him.

27:45.600 --> 27:48.000
Do you?
Cards on the table, okay?

27:48.200 --> 27:52.400
Wolinsky refuses to concede that he
put an innocent man on death row.

27:53.300 --> 27:56.400
He won't even acknowledge that
they got the tip about the fence.

27:56.700 --> 27:58.600
Maybe that's because
the tip was a dead end.

27:58.800 --> 28:01.500
It wasn't. There's
independent confirmation.

28:01.600 --> 28:05.000
Max Bronstein fenced some
jewelry from the Hagens.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.900
The bracelet was found during Dupree's trial.
Wolinsky ignored it.

28:11.100 --> 28:15.100
Of course, in itself it's not
enough to prove Dupree's innocence

28:15.200 --> 28:16.800
or your client's guilt.

28:18.100 --> 28:20.500
Only the person who called
in the tip could do that.

28:21.900 --> 28:23.600
Sorry, I can't help you.

28:23.700 --> 28:26.900
I'm not asking you to break the
attorney-client privilege.

28:27.700 --> 28:30.300
But I don't think it would stretch
your ethics too much to recommend

28:30.200 --> 28:31.800
your client take this deal.

28:32.000 --> 28:33.800
Even if I don't think
it's in his best interest?

28:33.900 --> 28:38.500
Your job is to achieve the best
result for your client. You know me.

28:38.500 --> 28:40.600
From here on in, it won't
get any better for him.

28:41.500 --> 28:43.800
You make the offer.
I'll call it the way I see it.

28:43.900 --> 28:44.900
Steven Dupree.

28:45.100 --> 28:47.600
Don't talk to me
about Steven Dupree.

28:47.600 --> 28:49.800
Your office put him in jail.
You get him out.

28:49.800 --> 28:52.400
You know as well as I do that
without proof of his innocence

28:52.400 --> 28:54.200
or an admission of guilt
by your client,

28:54.200 --> 28:57.300
the chances of a court overturning
a jury verdict are next to nil.

28:57.300 --> 28:59.000
That can't be my problem, Jack.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.900
Let's just make
it right, Jamie.

29:01.300 --> 29:04.200
Because, uh, if we're going
to play by the rules,

29:04.100 --> 29:07.000
you already violated
attorney-client privilege

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
when you tipped off
Wolinsky, and I,

29:09.000 --> 29:13.200
as an officer of the court, I have a duty
to inform the Disciplinary Committee

29:13.100 --> 29:14.600
and your client.

29:15.000 --> 29:16.000
Is that a threat?

29:16.000 --> 29:17.400
Jamie, please.

29:20.600 --> 29:22.000
Just get Gordon
to take the plea.

29:30.400 --> 29:31.900
About time.

29:31.900 --> 29:34.600
I'm gonna be late for
cookies and milk at Rikers.

29:36.100 --> 29:38.600
I have a one-time offer,
Mr. Gordon.

29:39.600 --> 29:43.000
Your plea of guilty for the murders
of Martin Felder and Dana Hagen

29:43.400 --> 29:46.400
in return for concurrent
sentences of 25-to-life.

29:47.100 --> 29:48.600
You have an hour
to make up your mind.

29:48.700 --> 29:50.700
No way.
I want a trial.

29:51.900 --> 29:54.200
Didn't you tell 'em
I want a trial?

29:55.600 --> 29:59.900
I'm sure Ms. Ross will agree, a
trial's not in your best interest.

30:02.100 --> 30:06.800
(SIGHING) Mr. Gordon, I'm resigning as
your counsel, effective immediately.

30:07.100 --> 30:09.500
While representing you,
I violated the code of conduct

30:09.500 --> 30:11.400
and breached our
attorney-client privilege.

30:11.400 --> 30:15.400
I'll be making a full disclosure to
Disciplinary Committee of the New York Bar.

30:15.700 --> 30:17.200
I'll help you
find a new attorney.

30:17.300 --> 30:19.400
In the meantime,
keep your mouth shut.

30:21.900 --> 30:24.800
Anything she tells the Disciplinary
Committee will be kept under seal.

30:24.900 --> 30:28.200
We won't be able to use it against Gordon.
It's brilliant.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.100
I knew there was a reason
I hired that young lady.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.300
You're both enjoying
this, aren't you?

30:34.100 --> 30:36.900
You tried to coerce her
into selling out her client.

30:36.900 --> 30:39.300
Lit your own petard, my boy.

30:39.200 --> 30:43.000
A judge can still compel her to
testify about what Gordon told her.

30:43.100 --> 30:46.300
How? Her conversations
with him are privileged.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.900
Not the ones she divulged
to third parties.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.700
Says you.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.700
Whatever I said during an
anonymous call four years ago

30:56.600 --> 30:59.600
resulted from information I received
from Mr. Gordon. It's privileged.

30:59.600 --> 31:02.400
She broke the privilege herself
when she called Wolinsky.

31:02.500 --> 31:03.900
She can't assert it now.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.800
The privilege belongs to Mr. Gordon.
Unless he waives it.

31:06.800 --> 31:08.900
Your Honor, her anonymous call

31:09.000 --> 31:12.900
contains information crucial to the
prosecution of a capital crime

31:12.900 --> 31:14.100
committed by Gordon.

31:14.400 --> 31:16.200
Just a minute,
Mr. McCoy.

31:16.300 --> 31:19.800
Ms. Ross, this tip
concerned your client?

31:20.100 --> 31:21.600
Yes.
JUDGE: Ms. Ross...

31:21.900 --> 31:23.800
I've already informed
the Disciplinary Committee.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.100
What did you tell
Judge Wolinsky?

31:26.100 --> 31:28.600
That he had charged the wrong man
in the murder of Dana Hagen,

31:28.700 --> 31:31.200
and that a fence named Max
Bronstein had received goods

31:31.200 --> 31:32.700
stolen from the Hagen home.

31:32.900 --> 31:35.900
And you had gotten this information
directly from your client?

31:36.000 --> 31:38.400
Yes, among other details
relating to the Hagen murder.

31:38.400 --> 31:39.900
When I called Wolinsky
the second time,

31:39.900 --> 31:42.500
I essentially repeated
the same information.

31:42.800 --> 31:45.300
You called Wolinsky
again? When?

31:45.700 --> 31:48.400
During Steven Dupree's trial, just
before the case went to jury.

31:48.300 --> 31:52.000
Mr. McCoy, it is obvious anything
Ms. Ross might say in court

31:52.100 --> 31:56.200
would only further breach Mr. Gordon's
attorney-client privilege.

31:56.700 --> 32:00.300
You cannot use her testimony against him.
Your motion is denied.

32:00.900 --> 32:03.700
Your Honor, I want to use her
testimony against a third party.

32:03.800 --> 32:04.900
JUDGE: Who?

32:05.400 --> 32:06.900
Andrew Wolinsky.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.100
The People plan to bring
charges of attempted murder.

32:10.200 --> 32:11.800
Against Judge Wolinsky?

32:11.800 --> 32:13.200
Yes.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.500
Ms. Ross testifies
against him.

32:15.400 --> 32:17.100
Nothing she says can be
used against Gordon.

32:17.200 --> 32:18.300
Your Honor...
JUDGE: Ms. Ross.

32:21.100 --> 32:23.000
On that limited basis,

32:24.600 --> 32:26.700
I don't see a problem.

32:26.800 --> 32:29.300
I'm issuing an order
for your testimony.

32:29.700 --> 32:33.000
And I sure hope you know what
you're doing, Mr. McCoy.

32:34.600 --> 32:37.100
BRISCOE: Judge Wolinsky,
you mind coming with us?

32:37.200 --> 32:38.300
What? What for?

32:38.300 --> 32:41.500
You're under arrest for the
attempted murder of Steven Dupree.

32:41.500 --> 32:42.800
What is this, a joke?
No, Your Honor.

32:42.900 --> 32:45.200
We'll have to ask you
to remove the robe.

32:46.700 --> 32:49.700
Call Helen Brolin.
Her number's in my Rolodex.

32:49.800 --> 32:51.400
You have the right
to remain silent.

32:51.500 --> 32:53.600
Anything you do say can, and
will be used against you...

32:56.300 --> 32:57.600
ADAM: What in the world
were you thinking?

32:57.600 --> 32:59.400
What was Wolinsky thinking?

33:00.000 --> 33:04.000
Jamie called him twice. The second time
after they found the Hagen bracelet.

33:04.100 --> 33:06.000
It'll be her word
against Wolinsky's.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
Just because the grand
jury believed her...

33:08.100 --> 33:10.600
I haven't indicted him yet. I'm
hoping Wolinsky will spare himself

33:10.600 --> 33:11.900
the embarrassment and fold.

33:11.900 --> 33:13.000
And then?

33:13.100 --> 33:15.000
And then give me what I
need to convict Gordon.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.200
Oh.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.400
So you don't think that Wolinsky
committed attempted murder?

33:20.500 --> 33:22.300
Yes, he ignored evidence.

33:22.400 --> 33:24.200
He had reason to believe
Dupree was innocent,

33:24.200 --> 33:25.900
and he still sent
him to death row.

33:26.200 --> 33:28.200
A jury might see that
as attempted murder.

33:28.300 --> 33:30.400
They might never see it at all.

33:31.100 --> 33:33.900
Wolinsky just filed
for a preliminary hearing.

33:33.900 --> 33:35.300
He just has to convince a judge

33:35.400 --> 33:37.900
there isn't sufficient evidence
to sustain the charge.

33:38.000 --> 33:39.700
So a fellow judge

33:40.200 --> 33:42.600
will decide
Judge Wolinsky's fate.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.300
Is that what you
meant by folding?

33:49.100 --> 33:51.200
JAMIE: During one of our
meetings four years ago,

33:51.300 --> 33:53.900
Mr. Gordon boasted that
he'd killed Dana Hagen.

33:54.000 --> 33:56.100
The case was in the
papers at the time.

33:56.600 --> 33:58.700
Mr. Gordon provided details.

33:58.700 --> 34:02.400
He even named the person he used to fence
jewelry stolen from the Hagen home.

34:02.500 --> 34:05.500
I confirmed enough of his information
to know he was telling the truth.

34:05.600 --> 34:06.900
What did you do then?

34:06.900 --> 34:09.000
I tried persuading him
to come forward,

34:09.100 --> 34:10.500
but he refused.

34:11.199 --> 34:13.300
I wasn't sure
what to do next. I...

34:13.400 --> 34:15.900
I knew I had an
obligation to Mr. Gordon,

34:16.500 --> 34:19.000
but I felt what I can only
describe as a higher duty

34:19.100 --> 34:21.199
to prevent a miscarriage
of justice.

34:21.699 --> 34:24.800
I called the Bar Association's
ethics hotline for guidance.

34:24.699 --> 34:25.900
JACK: What did
they tell you?

34:25.900 --> 34:28.400
JAMIE: That my safest course
of action was to do nothing.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.199
But I couldn't accept that.

34:31.900 --> 34:34.199
That's when I placed an anonymous
call to Andrew Wolinsky.

34:34.300 --> 34:35.800
JACK: What did
you tell him?

34:35.800 --> 34:37.900
(SIGHING) I didn't want
to implicate my client,

34:38.000 --> 34:41.500
but I wanted to give just enough
information to clear Mr. Dupree.

34:41.500 --> 34:44.699
So, I told Mr. Wolinsky that
Steven Dupree was innocent.

34:44.900 --> 34:48.400
I told him about the fence, Max
Bronstein, about the stolen jewelry.

34:48.800 --> 34:51.000
JACK: How did
Mr. Wolinsky respond?

34:51.000 --> 34:54.699
He took down Max Bronstein's
name, thanked me, and hung up.

34:54.699 --> 34:56.000
Did you follow up?

34:56.100 --> 35:00.000
Yes. A few weeks later, after
Mr. Dupree's case had proceeded to trial,

35:00.000 --> 35:02.500
I called
Mr. Wolinsky again.

35:02.500 --> 35:06.000
I remember it was the day just
before the summations. August 20th.

35:06.100 --> 35:10.300
Did you know that by that time Dana
Hagen's bracelet had been recovered

35:10.300 --> 35:12.300
and traced to Max Bronstein?

35:12.300 --> 35:13.400
No.

35:13.500 --> 35:16.500
What did you tell
Mr. Wolinsky on August 20th?

35:16.500 --> 35:18.700
I repeated what I told
him the first time.

35:19.100 --> 35:21.600
I offered to give
him more information.

35:21.900 --> 35:23.500
I was ready
to go out on a limb.

35:23.600 --> 35:25.600
What did Mr. Wolinsky say?

35:27.400 --> 35:29.400
He said that he
was a very busy man.

35:29.900 --> 35:32.600
That it was a crime to provide
false information to the police.

35:33.100 --> 35:34.800
And then, he hung up on me.

35:35.500 --> 35:36.600
Thank you.

35:38.900 --> 35:42.100
Did you tape these calls?
Keep any phone records?

35:42.400 --> 35:43.700
No.

35:44.400 --> 35:45.700
So all we have is your word.

35:45.800 --> 35:48.600
Why would I admit violating
the code of conduct?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.300
Good question.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.100
Since you left the District
Attorney's Office,

35:54.200 --> 35:57.300
you've done pro bono work for the
Southern Poverty Law Center.

35:57.300 --> 35:58.600
Yes, some work.

35:58.500 --> 36:01.300
They're an anti-death penalty
advocacy group, aren't they?

36:01.400 --> 36:03.200
JAMIE: That's only one
aspect of their work.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
Are you opposed
to the death penalty?

36:06.000 --> 36:07.500
Objection. Relevance.

36:07.500 --> 36:08.600
Goes to credibility.

36:08.700 --> 36:11.500
Overruled. Answer her
question, Ms. Ross.

36:11.700 --> 36:13.700
Yes, I'm opposed
to the death penalty.

36:13.800 --> 36:15.400
Did you always feel this way?

36:15.400 --> 36:16.700
No.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.400
What changed your mind?

36:20.300 --> 36:23.800
When I worked at the D.A's office,
I saw the death penalty applied.

36:27.400 --> 36:29.300
A.D.A's are overworked.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.100
They're competitive.

36:31.200 --> 36:34.500
They often act out of their own
prejudices or personal hurts.

36:34.500 --> 36:37.600
What they think the politics
demands They make mistakes.

36:37.700 --> 36:39.100
Errors of judgment.

36:40.200 --> 36:42.100
The death penalty is final.

36:42.300 --> 36:45.000
It eliminates any chance
of correcting those mistakes.

36:45.000 --> 36:46.300
How moving.

36:46.500 --> 36:49.800
And how fortunate you stumbled across
a perfect example of your thesis.

36:49.900 --> 36:53.900
I didn't make up what Michael Gordon told me.
I wouldn't lie.

36:53.900 --> 36:55.700
You're St. Joan
of Hogan Place.

36:55.800 --> 36:58.000
You are moved by a
call to a higher duty.

36:58.100 --> 37:00.400
It allows you to violate
Mr. Gordon's confidence.

37:00.400 --> 37:01.500
That's not what I meant.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.000
Why wouldn't it
allow you to lie?

37:03.100 --> 37:05.500
I didn't lie. You lied
to Michael Gordon.

37:05.600 --> 37:08.000
You told him you'd keep his
confidences, didn't you?

37:10.300 --> 37:11.400
Yes.

37:11.500 --> 37:12.600
You lie when it suits you.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.400
You change opinions
the way I change blouses.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.000
You flit from one
cause to another.

37:17.000 --> 37:18.100
Objection.
Why should we

37:18.200 --> 37:20.200
believe anything
you tell this court?

37:20.300 --> 37:22.200
Ms. Brolin, you
made your point.

37:23.900 --> 37:26.000
Then no more
questions, Your Honor.

37:28.900 --> 37:30.100
(SIGHING)

37:33.100 --> 37:35.600
I worked on the Hagen case
for nearly 18 months.

37:35.500 --> 37:37.600
I spoke with
dozens of witnesses,

37:37.600 --> 37:39.400
read over 100 police reports,

37:39.400 --> 37:42.000
and received I don't know
how many phone calls.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.100
But I don't remember getting any calls
like the ones Ms. Ross described.

37:46.100 --> 37:47.900
Did you receive
any tips at all?

37:47.900 --> 37:49.100
Not personally, no.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.800
But the police did.

37:50.900 --> 37:55.000
Cases like these always generate a
lot of tips, most of them false.

37:55.500 --> 37:59.400
If there had been any that led anywhere,
I'm sure the police would have told me.

38:00.000 --> 38:01.200
Now, Judge,

38:02.000 --> 38:04.300
as you sit here
today under oath,

38:05.000 --> 38:07.800
are you still convinced you put
the right man on death row

38:07.900 --> 38:09.400
for the murder of Dana Hagen?

38:10.000 --> 38:12.900
Yes. Without a doubt,
absolutely.

38:13.700 --> 38:14.800
Thank you.

38:19.900 --> 38:21.700
So I guess you
don't make mistakes.

38:21.700 --> 38:24.200
(SCOFFS) Not in this case, no.

38:24.700 --> 38:28.100
What about the bracelet that sat on a
shelf in the Bronx for four years?

38:28.400 --> 38:31.400
I was unaware of that until you
brought it to my attention.

38:31.400 --> 38:35.200
If you weren't aware, whose fault is that?
The police?

38:35.700 --> 38:37.100
I suppose so.

38:37.700 --> 38:39.900
If that lead wasn't followed,

38:40.300 --> 38:42.300
again, that's the fault
of the police?

38:42.400 --> 38:44.700
If it was a
legitimate lead, yes.

38:45.400 --> 38:47.300
It's up to them
to investigate it.

38:48.000 --> 38:52.500
But my guess is Mr. Dupree disposed of
the bracelet before he was arrested.

38:52.500 --> 38:55.700
But since the investigating detectives
didn't do their job, we'll never know.

38:55.800 --> 38:57.000
It's moot.

38:57.500 --> 39:00.100
Dupree was identified
by the victim's husband.

39:00.200 --> 39:02.800
As a former prosecutor,
you're aware of the studies

39:02.700 --> 39:05.100
documenting the unreliability
of eyewitnesses?

39:05.100 --> 39:06.200
Yes.

39:06.300 --> 39:09.800
JACK: Mr. Hagen got a quick glimpse
of the suspect on a dark street.

39:09.800 --> 39:11.600
He might have
been mistaken, yes?

39:11.600 --> 39:12.900
It's possible.

39:13.100 --> 39:16.500
But you're forgetting the fact that
Mr. Dupree offered to confess.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.400
On the advice of his attorney,
and only if you took

39:18.400 --> 39:19.700
the death penalty
off the table.

39:19.800 --> 39:20.900
Yes.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.900
If it turns out
that he is innocent,

39:22.900 --> 39:24.500
his lawyer gave him bad advice.

39:25.300 --> 39:26.500
I'd say so.

39:26.700 --> 39:28.500
In the unlikely event
he's innocent.

39:28.600 --> 39:32.000
If he is, his conviction is the
result of terrible mistakes

39:32.100 --> 39:34.200
by the police,
by Mr. Hagen,

39:34.400 --> 39:36.300
by Dupree's attorney,
by Dupree himself.

39:36.200 --> 39:39.500
By everyone except you,
because you don't mistakes.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.000
Isn't that what you're saying?
No, no, no, no, no.

39:42.500 --> 39:45.000
If the evidence had been there,
I would have looked into it.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.100
You were afraid to. You were to
about deliver your summation.

39:48.100 --> 39:50.000
Dupree had to be your guy.

39:50.100 --> 39:52.000
That's not true.
Three days

39:52.000 --> 39:54.700
after Dupree was
sentenced to death,

39:54.700 --> 39:58.400
didn't you ask Adam Schiff to put
your name up for a judgeship?

40:00.400 --> 40:01.800
Yes or no?

40:02.000 --> 40:03.200
Yes.

40:03.300 --> 40:05.700
Dupree's conviction was
your ticket to the bench.

40:05.900 --> 40:07.000
No.

40:07.100 --> 40:10.300
Isn't that why you turned down
his offer of a confession?

40:10.200 --> 40:11.500
No.
Isn't that why

40:11.600 --> 40:13.500
you ignored
Ms. Rose's phone calls?

40:13.600 --> 40:16.200
ANDREW: No, I didn't... JACK:
Because it wasn't a mistake?

40:17.000 --> 40:20.400
You placed your ambition
above a man's life.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.400
I know down to my bones
that Steven Dupree is guilty.

40:23.500 --> 40:25.000
You'll never convince
me otherwise.

40:25.100 --> 40:26.900
We start second
guessing ourselves,

40:27.000 --> 40:29.900
pretty soon the public starts
second guessing the process.

40:29.800 --> 40:33.300
And society won't tolerate that.
It needs the certainty of justice.

40:33.400 --> 40:34.900
JACK: Your Honor...
You look at the facts,

40:35.000 --> 40:37.600
you decide on a course of action,
and then you stick to it.

40:37.600 --> 40:40.200
That is how
I work, Mr. McCoy!

40:41.900 --> 40:43.700
That is how we all work.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.600
JUDGE:
Given the record before me,

40:55.900 --> 40:59.100
I see no credible reason to
reject Ms. Rose's testimony.

40:59.100 --> 41:01.400
That being said, let me add,

41:01.700 --> 41:05.200
in the heat of atrial,
details can be overlooked.

41:05.700 --> 41:08.700
We all wish the
administration of justice

41:08.700 --> 41:11.400
could have been
more diligent. However,

41:11.900 --> 41:13.900
I see no evidence

41:14.500 --> 41:18.200
of a crucial element of a
crime of attempted murder.

41:18.400 --> 41:21.900
I see no evidence of intent.

41:22.200 --> 41:23.900
If Judge Wolinsky

41:24.000 --> 41:28.000
committed any wrong, it was a
crime of arrogance, not design.

41:29.000 --> 41:32.600
Therefore, I find insufficient evidence
to allow this matter to proceed.

41:32.600 --> 41:35.200
The charge is dismissed.
(BANGS GAVEL)

41:53.400 --> 41:55.700
Mr. McCoy, anywhere we can talk?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.800
What is it you
wanted to tell us?

42:01.900 --> 42:03.700
Bronx vice sent over
the hooker's bracelet

42:03.600 --> 42:05.000
in the middle
of Dupree's trial.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.800
I had it tested for prints.

42:06.800 --> 42:09.800
We found Max Bronstein
and Michael Gordon's.

42:10.300 --> 42:11.700
Did Wolinsky know?
Uh-huh.

42:11.700 --> 42:13.200
I showed him the report.

42:13.300 --> 42:15.100
He asked me if I still
thought Dupree did it.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.800
I... I told him I'd have a
hard time finding him guilty.

42:17.800 --> 42:19.400
Wolinsky said he wouldn't.

42:19.400 --> 42:20.800
CARMICHAEL:
What did you do?

42:20.800 --> 42:23.600
Wolinsky told me to wipe off the
bracelet and send it back to the Bronx.

42:23.700 --> 42:26.400
He wanted all copies
of the fingerprint report.

42:26.400 --> 42:29.600
And that's how the police screwed
up and let old Andy Wolinsky down.

42:30.300 --> 42:32.400
Did you keep
a copy of the report?

42:35.200 --> 42:37.900
No. But there was one
I couldn't get rid of.

42:39.600 --> 42:41.800
This report was
in Latent's files.

42:41.900 --> 42:43.400
Now it's in ours.

42:50.400 --> 42:53.000
You still want atrial, Mr. Gordon?
It's your right.

42:53.100 --> 42:57.200
Well, defense's exhibit one is
Steven Dupree's conviction.

42:57.200 --> 43:00.600
Which I guarantee will be voided by
the time your client comes to trial.

43:05.100 --> 43:08.700
The offer is still 25-to-life for
Dana Hagen and Martin Felder.

43:11.900 --> 43:15.700
I want to remind you you'll be facing
the death penalty for Martin Felder.

43:19.100 --> 43:20.300
I'll take it.

43:24.200 --> 43:25.900
I'll do the quarter.

43:39.700 --> 43:41.200
Gordon pleaded out.

43:41.800 --> 43:43.000
I heard.

43:44.900 --> 43:48.400
We re-filed against Wolinsky.
Let's see what happens.

43:51.600 --> 43:54.000
The committee
ask you to testify?

43:55.000 --> 43:56.200
No.

44:00.100 --> 44:02.500
(SIGHING) Last time I was
here, it wasn't by choice.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.600
I hated the...
It's okay.

44:05.300 --> 44:08.000
Whatever you told them,
it softened the blow.

44:12.100 --> 44:13.900
Life's a funny old dog, isn't it?
(CHUCKLES)

44:18.300 --> 44:20.100
I'm scared, Jack.

44:21.100 --> 44:22.800
I love the law.

44:23.305 --> 44:29.240
