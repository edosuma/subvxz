00:07.626 --> 00:08.709
Guys,

00:08.751 --> 00:10.834
something horrible

00:08.751 --> 00:10.834
is happening to me.

00:10.876 --> 00:12.000
My face is leaking.

00:13.083 --> 00:14.042
What?

00:14.083 --> 00:15.500
Liquid is dripping

00:14.083 --> 00:15.500
out of my nose.

00:15.542 --> 00:18.000
And sometimes it shoots out

00:15.542 --> 00:18.000
with explosive force.

00:20.083 --> 00:22.250
Like that.

00:22.292 --> 00:26.042
Your face isn't leaking.

00:22.292 --> 00:26.042
You just have the flu.

00:26.083 --> 00:29.334
This guy,

00:26.083 --> 00:29.334
he's got leaky face.

00:31.918 --> 00:33.000
Here's a tissue...

00:35.250 --> 00:36.459
and a bucket.

00:40.250 --> 00:42.042
I have the flu?

00:42.083 --> 00:43.209
Oh, no.

00:43.250 --> 00:45.042
So what are you gonna do?

00:43.250 --> 00:45.042
Throw me in a volcano?

00:45.083 --> 00:46.584
Because that's pretty much

00:45.083 --> 00:46.584
the cure

00:46.626 --> 00:48.876
for everything

00:46.626 --> 00:48.876
on my planet.

00:48.918 --> 00:50.042
First of all,

00:50.083 --> 00:52.167
I wouldn't really know

00:50.083 --> 00:52.167
how to do that.

00:52.209 --> 00:54.417
But all you need

00:52.209 --> 00:54.417
is a little rest

00:54.459 --> 00:56.876
and a little tender

00:54.459 --> 00:56.876
loving care.

00:56.918 --> 00:59.000
And, by the way,

00:56.918 --> 00:59.000
your planet sounds horrible.

01:03.125 --> 01:05.334
I can't believe you hugged

01:03.125 --> 01:05.334
Skylar when she's sick.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.292
You're usually

01:05.375 --> 01:07.292
not so big on germs.

01:07.334 --> 01:08.417
What makes

01:07.334 --> 01:08.417
you say that?

01:13.083 --> 01:14.417
Gather around,

01:13.083 --> 01:14.417
everyone.

01:14.459 --> 01:16.918
The hospital

01:14.459 --> 01:16.918
staff rankings are out.

01:16.959 --> 01:18.125
Rankings?

01:18.167 --> 01:20.250
Every year,

01:18.167 --> 01:20.250
the patients evaluate the staff

01:20.292 --> 01:21.417
in a number of categories.

01:21.459 --> 01:23.542
I keep the details

01:21.459 --> 01:23.542
confidential,

01:23.584 --> 01:25.250
but I make

01:23.584 --> 01:25.250
the rankings public

01:25.292 --> 01:27.542
because I'm bored,

01:25.292 --> 01:27.542
and I love drama.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
Yes.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
I'm at the top.

01:33.042 --> 01:34.542
I don't want to brag,

01:34.584 --> 01:35.667
but I'm better than you.

01:35.709 --> 01:36.667
I'm better than you.

01:36.709 --> 01:37.959
And I'm better

01:36.709 --> 01:37.959
than you.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.292
I'm last?

01:42.334 --> 01:43.667
Oh, I don't get it.

01:43.709 --> 01:46.292
I thought patients liked me.

01:43.709 --> 01:46.292
How could I be dead last?

01:46.334 --> 01:48.584
No, no,

01:46.334 --> 01:48.584
you're not dead last.

01:48.626 --> 01:50.292
This is just

01:48.626 --> 01:50.292
the top sheet.

01:50.334 --> 01:52.209
See? You're second

01:50.334 --> 01:52.209
to dead last.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.959
Right, of course.

01:55.000 --> 01:56.584

02:46.709 --> 02:48.542
I can't believe

02:46.709 --> 02:48.542
I'm at the bottom of the list.

02:48.584 --> 02:51.584
Even Doctor Malpractice

02:48.584 --> 02:51.584
is above me.

02:51.626 --> 02:54.667
It's pronounced

02:51.626 --> 02:54.667
Mal-proc-teese.

02:54.709 --> 02:58.042
But he does leave a lot of

02:54.709 --> 02:58.042
stuff inside people.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.375
Like this guy.

03:03.459 --> 03:05.083
How can I get patients

03:03.459 --> 03:05.083
to like me more?

03:05.125 --> 03:06.459
It's obvious.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.042
You just need to adopt

03:06.500 --> 03:09.042
a "Kaz-do" spirit.

03:09.083 --> 03:11.125
Develop a whole new

03:09.083 --> 03:11.125
"Kazzitude."

03:11.167 --> 03:13.500
Show 'em the "Kaz hands."

03:14.751 --> 03:17.626
Be more like me.

03:17.667 --> 03:21.250
Well, you're at the top,

03:17.667 --> 03:21.250
and I am at the bottom,

03:21.292 --> 03:22.667
so maybe I should be

03:21.292 --> 03:22.667
more like you.

03:22.709 --> 03:23.667
It won't be easy,

03:23.709 --> 03:26.667
but I'll give it my

03:23.709 --> 03:26.667
"All-liver."

03:29.834 --> 03:31.709
And you wonder

03:29.834 --> 03:31.709
why patients don't like you.

03:33.500 --> 03:36.667
Your problem is

03:33.500 --> 03:36.667
you look before you leap.

03:36.709 --> 03:39.667
What you should do is leap

03:36.709 --> 03:39.667
before you look,

03:39.709 --> 03:40.709
like this.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.751
My back.

03:46.792 --> 03:49.500
It's so much better.

03:49.542 --> 03:51.083
I feel like

03:49.542 --> 03:51.083
I'm 20 years younger.

03:51.125 --> 03:52.667
No wonder

03:51.125 --> 03:52.667
you're at the top of the list.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.626
See?

03:56.667 --> 03:58.250
I'd better make sure

03:56.667 --> 03:58.250
your thoracic vertebrae

03:58.292 --> 03:59.292
aren't damaged.

03:59.334 --> 04:00.709
My back!

04:00.751 --> 04:02.334
It's so much worse.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.375
I feel like

04:02.375 --> 04:04.375
I'm 20 years older.

04:04.417 --> 04:06.584
No wonder you're

04:04.417 --> 04:06.584
at the bottom of the list!

04:11.584 --> 04:14.667
Alan, can you please

04:11.584 --> 04:14.667
get me a blanket?

04:14.709 --> 04:16.209
I'm achy,

04:16.250 --> 04:19.000
and I'm cold

04:16.250 --> 04:19.000
and I don't feel good.

04:23.083 --> 04:24.834
Oh, are you sick?

04:24.876 --> 04:27.250
What a coincidence

04:24.876 --> 04:27.250
because I'm sick.

04:27.292 --> 04:30.042
I'm sick of sick people

04:27.292 --> 04:30.042
telling me they're sick.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.792
You're in a hospital.

04:30.083 --> 04:32.792
That's where sick people go.

04:32.834 --> 04:35.584
And I'm sick of it.

04:35.626 --> 04:36.792
Besides,

04:35.626 --> 04:36.792
I'm too busy to get

04:36.834 --> 04:39.209
some washed-up superhero

04:36.834 --> 04:39.209
a stupid blanket.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.542
I need to figure out

04:39.250 --> 04:40.542
how to move up

04:40.584 --> 04:41.792
in the staff rankings

04:41.834 --> 04:44.042
and get my Uncle Horace

04:41.834 --> 04:44.042
to take me seriously.

04:44.083 --> 04:47.042
Please get me a blanket.

04:47.083 --> 04:49.042
My head is throbbing,

04:49.083 --> 04:51.626
and my stomach hurts

04:49.083 --> 04:51.626
and I don't know what to do.

04:51.667 --> 04:53.500
Oliver told me

04:51.667 --> 04:53.500
to try chicken soup,

04:53.542 --> 04:54.626
but I don't think

04:53.542 --> 04:54.626
it's helping.

04:56.792 --> 04:58.584
Why don't you just get

04:56.792 --> 04:58.584
the blanket yourself,

04:58.626 --> 05:00.292
since you're obviously

04:58.626 --> 05:00.292
able to fly again?

05:00.334 --> 05:02.375
What are you talking abo--

05:03.500 --> 05:04.834
Are you kidding me?

05:04.876 --> 05:06.709
I'm flying again.

05:09.709 --> 05:12.459
I think your flu is causing

05:09.709 --> 05:12.459
your power of flight to return.

05:12.500 --> 05:14.876
This could be a major

05:12.500 --> 05:14.876
medical breakthrough.

05:14.918 --> 05:16.209
Tell you what,

05:16.250 --> 05:17.667
you let me

05:16.250 --> 05:17.667
take credit for this,

05:17.709 --> 05:19.250
I'll get you

05:17.709 --> 05:19.250
whatever you want.

05:19.292 --> 05:23.292
Well, some crackers for

05:19.292 --> 05:23.292
my foot soup would be nice.

05:24.292 --> 05:25.584
You got it.

05:25.626 --> 05:28.292
Because if this works out,

05:25.626 --> 05:28.292
everyone will love me.

05:28.334 --> 05:30.667
Not only will I be number one

05:28.334 --> 05:30.667
in the staff rankings,

05:30.709 --> 05:33.542
but maybe my Uncle Horace

05:30.709 --> 05:33.542
will take down all these signs.

05:39.626 --> 05:42.876
Hey, you're Neocortex.

05:42.918 --> 05:43.876
What's wrong?

05:43.918 --> 05:45.417
I hurt my shoulder,

05:45.459 --> 05:48.209
surfing the Internet.

05:48.250 --> 05:49.834
Funny squirrel video,

05:48.250 --> 05:49.834
fell out of my chair.

05:49.876 --> 05:51.209
I don't want to

05:49.876 --> 05:51.209
talk about it.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.709
Anyway, just sign my chart

05:51.250 --> 05:53.709
and get me out of here.

05:53.751 --> 05:54.918
Oh, no problem.

05:56.083 --> 05:57.626
I just remembered

05:56.083 --> 05:57.626
something--

05:57.667 --> 06:01.250
Yes, I do have the power

05:57.667 --> 06:01.250
to send out psychic bursts

06:01.292 --> 06:04.751
which can immobilize a villain

06:01.292 --> 06:04.751
or control their behavior.

06:04.792 --> 06:06.792
It's called

06:04.792 --> 06:06.792
neural manipulation.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.083
How did you know I was--

06:08.125 --> 06:09.417
Was gonna ask that?

06:09.459 --> 06:11.667
'Cause I also have

06:09.459 --> 06:11.667
the power to read minds.

06:11.709 --> 06:14.667
Not to mention the power of

06:11.709 --> 06:14.667
psychic communication...

06:14.709 --> 06:17.792
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Which is how I'm talking</font></i>

06:14.709 --> 06:17.792
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">to you right now!</font></i>

06:20.334 --> 06:23.584
Okay, I'm gonna need to

06:20.334 --> 06:23.584
test out all of your powers.

06:23.626 --> 06:25.375
Why don't you go ahead

06:23.626 --> 06:25.375
and make me--

06:25.417 --> 06:28.542
I don't know--

06:25.417 --> 06:28.542
a little more adventurous

06:28.584 --> 06:31.584
and daring

06:28.584 --> 06:31.584
and "leap-before-I-looky?"

06:32.834 --> 06:34.417
Dude,

06:32.834 --> 06:34.417
I can read your mind.

06:34.459 --> 06:36.709
You want me to make you

06:34.459 --> 06:36.709
more like your friend Kaz.

06:36.751 --> 06:38.167
Fine.

06:38.209 --> 06:39.918
Let's try it this way,

06:38.209 --> 06:39.918
if you don't do it for me,

06:39.959 --> 06:41.709
I won't sign your chart.

06:41.751 --> 06:45.751
That's what we call

06:41.751 --> 06:45.751
plain old manipulation.

06:46.751 --> 06:47.751
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Weasel.</font></i>

06:47.792 --> 06:48.751
I can hear you.

06:48.792 --> 06:50.417
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Yeah, I know.</font></i>

06:51.959 --> 06:54.459
Fine.

06:51.959 --> 06:54.459
Let's do this thing.

06:59.167 --> 07:01.751
Hmm. I don't

06:59.167 --> 07:01.751
feel any different.

07:01.792 --> 07:03.876
Ooh,

07:03.918 --> 07:06.626
I wonder

07:03.918 --> 07:06.626
what this button does.

07:08.250 --> 07:10.792
Aah!

07:13.667 --> 07:16.834
That was awesome!

07:24.417 --> 07:26.167
Here's your blanket.

07:26.209 --> 07:28.459
And I got you

07:26.209 --> 07:28.459
some magazines,

07:28.500 --> 07:30.626
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Modern Sweater Vests</font></i>

07:30.667 --> 07:33.918
and <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> People...</font></i>

07:30.667 --> 07:33.918
<i><font face="monospaceSansSerif">Who Wear Sweater Vests.</font></i>

07:35.542 --> 07:36.876
Anyway,

07:35.542 --> 07:36.876
you seem to be feeling better.

07:36.918 --> 07:39.500
I am, but I can't seem to fly

07:36.918 --> 07:39.500
as high now.

07:39.542 --> 07:40.500
What?

07:40.542 --> 07:42.375
That's terrible.

07:42.417 --> 07:45.209
If Normo flu restored

07:42.417 --> 07:45.209
your power to fly,

07:45.250 --> 07:46.918
then getting better must be

07:45.250 --> 07:46.918
making your power disappear.

07:48.083 --> 07:52.042
How dare you get better

07:48.083 --> 07:52.042
behind my back?

07:52.083 --> 07:54.709
It's not my fault, Alan.

07:52.083 --> 07:54.709
People get better.

07:54.751 --> 07:56.667
Not when I treat them,

07:54.751 --> 07:56.667
they don't.

07:57.959 --> 07:59.626
If you want to keep

07:57.959 --> 07:59.626
your power to fly,

07:59.667 --> 08:01.000
we have to get you sicker.

08:02.626 --> 08:04.042
Fine.

08:02.626 --> 08:04.042
Do whatever it takes.

08:04.083 --> 08:05.792
Hey, Absolute Zero,

08:05.834 --> 08:07.792
drop the temperature

08:05.834 --> 08:07.792
in here.

08:10.083 --> 08:11.167
Blue Tornado,

08:11.209 --> 08:13.292
give me a little arctic blast.

08:18.334 --> 08:19.292
And, Snowstorm,

08:19.334 --> 08:21.500
could you get me

08:19.334 --> 08:21.500
a hot cocoa?

08:21.542 --> 08:22.834
It's really cold in here.

08:26.626 --> 08:27.584
It's working.

08:27.626 --> 08:28.792
Stick with me,

08:28.834 --> 08:30.626
and I'll have you sick

08:28.834 --> 08:30.626
as a dog,

08:30.667 --> 08:32.375
a super flying dog.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.375
Hey, check out

08:35.375 --> 08:37.375
the centerfold.

08:42.833 --> 08:45.000
I'm Dr. Walrus Diaz.

08:45.042 --> 08:47.375
Who are you and how many fish

08:45.042 --> 08:47.375
can you catch?

08:49.709 --> 08:51.709
- What's going on here?

08:49.709 --> 08:51.709
- Oh, good news, bro.

08:51.751 --> 08:54.667
I convinced Neocortex

08:51.751 --> 08:54.667
to mess with my brain junk.

08:54.709 --> 08:55.792
He made me more like you.

08:55.834 --> 08:58.042
That is--

08:55.834 --> 08:58.042
This is--

08:58.083 --> 08:59.751
TOGETHER: Awesome!

09:01.918 --> 09:02.876
Ooh.

09:02.918 --> 09:03.834
'Sup, girl?

09:03.876 --> 09:05.417
Look,

09:03.876 --> 09:05.417
I know you just got here,

09:05.459 --> 09:07.834
but there's one test

09:05.459 --> 09:07.834
I know you need.

09:07.876 --> 09:09.792
A CAT scan.

09:07.876 --> 09:09.792
Meow.

09:09.834 --> 09:11.417
Drrrrrr...!

09:12.709 --> 09:14.626
What are you doing?

09:12.709 --> 09:14.626
That's my line.

09:14.667 --> 09:18.042
I knew I had heard it

09:14.667 --> 09:18.042
from somewhere.

09:18.083 --> 09:19.042
Hey, Serge.

09:19.083 --> 09:20.751
More power to ya.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.083
That's it.

09:24.125 --> 09:25.626
You can act like me,

09:25.667 --> 09:27.459
but you can't be better

09:25.667 --> 09:27.459
at being me than me.

09:28.834 --> 09:31.042
Neocortex, it's time to

09:28.834 --> 09:31.042
bring back the old Oliver back.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.375
No way.

09:32.417 --> 09:33.584
Being like Kaz is

09:33.626 --> 09:35.626
super-Kaz-afragilistic-

09:33.626 --> 09:35.626
expi-Kaz-adocious.

09:35.667 --> 09:38.042
I know it is.

09:38.083 --> 09:40.042
But being me is my thing.

09:40.083 --> 09:41.751
It's the only thing

09:40.083 --> 09:41.751
I know how to do.

09:42.792 --> 09:45.834
Neocortex, please,

09:42.792 --> 09:45.834
change him back.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.000
No. I don't want

09:45.876 --> 09:47.000
to change back.

09:53.834 --> 09:55.500
What did you just do?

09:55.542 --> 09:59.626
I just deflected Neocortex's

09:55.542 --> 09:59.626
neural beam like a boss.

10:00.792 --> 10:04.876
You overloaded his brain

10:00.792 --> 10:04.876
like a horrible boss.

10:04.918 --> 10:06.709
Oh.

10:06.751 --> 10:09.918
Commemorative

10:06.751 --> 10:09.918
"I Olivered this up" fake photo.

10:17.792 --> 10:20.459
Oliver, you scrambled

10:17.792 --> 10:20.459
a superhero's brain,

10:20.500 --> 10:22.667
and Horace is going to

10:20.500 --> 10:22.667
blame me because,

10:22.709 --> 10:24.626
well, that would usually be

10:22.709 --> 10:24.626
a very good assumption.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.042
Relax, I'm sure

10:25.834 --> 10:28.042
we can find a way to cure him.

10:28.083 --> 10:29.375
We just have to focus.

10:29.417 --> 10:31.751
Right, focus.

10:31.792 --> 10:34.667
( machine beeping )

10:36.000 --> 10:42.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:51.083 --> 10:53.667
Dude, we sound good.

10:55.417 --> 10:57.000
Wait, wait.

10:55.417 --> 10:57.000
This is serious.

10:57.042 --> 10:59.042
You're right.

10:57.042 --> 10:59.042
So what do we do?

10:59.083 --> 11:01.792
I don't know.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.792
You're the idea guy.

11:01.834 --> 11:03.042
I'm the action guy.

11:03.083 --> 11:04.959
Now we have

11:03.083 --> 11:04.959
two action guys.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.000
That's like having two--

11:07.834 --> 11:11.500
I don't know what it's like.

11:07.834 --> 11:11.500
I'm not the idea guy.

11:11.542 --> 11:14.375
Wait, I have an idea.

11:18.083 --> 11:20.918
Depressed tongue depressor.

11:20.959 --> 11:23.918
I don't like going into

11:20.959 --> 11:23.918
strangers' mouths.

11:26.542 --> 11:28.000
( alarming )

11:42.792 --> 11:44.918
That's your best

11:42.792 --> 11:44.918
flying time ever.

11:44.959 --> 11:45.959
Looking good.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.083
I am?

11:47.125 --> 11:50.125
No, it's just an expression.

11:47.125 --> 11:50.125
You look like a monster.

11:52.667 --> 11:53.834
I don't care.

11:53.876 --> 11:55.834
If getting sick restored

11:53.876 --> 11:55.834
one of my powers,

11:55.876 --> 11:58.709
then maybe getting even sicker

11:55.876 --> 11:58.709
will bring back all of them.

11:58.751 --> 12:01.083
And then Horace

11:58.751 --> 12:01.083
an clear me for battle.

12:06.500 --> 12:09.792
As a medical professional,

12:06.500 --> 12:09.792
I must advise against that.

12:09.834 --> 12:12.626
But as Alan,

12:09.834 --> 12:12.626
I say go for it.

12:14.792 --> 12:16.834
Oh, Uncle Horace.

12:16.876 --> 12:18.792
I discovered

12:16.876 --> 12:18.792
a medical miracle.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.209
I restored Skylar's

12:18.834 --> 12:20.209
power of flight.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.792
Well, that's stupendous,

12:20.250 --> 12:21.792
my boy,

12:21.834 --> 12:24.000
because the Board of

12:21.834 --> 12:24.000
Superhero Trustees

12:24.042 --> 12:25.459
has been all over me

12:24.042 --> 12:25.459
to come up

12:25.500 --> 12:27.626
with a medical breakthrough,

12:25.500 --> 12:27.626
or they'll cut our budget.

12:27.667 --> 12:28.792
For the record,

12:28.834 --> 12:30.709
I made this discovery

12:28.834 --> 12:30.709
all on my own.

12:30.751 --> 12:32.709
It's something no one else

12:30.751 --> 12:32.709
has ever seen.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.709
Amazing.

12:32.751 --> 12:34.709
Because until now,

12:34.751 --> 12:37.042
the only way a superhero

12:34.751 --> 12:37.042
could restore their powers

12:37.083 --> 12:38.959
was as a side effect

12:37.083 --> 12:38.959
of the Normo flu,

12:39.000 --> 12:41.834
but everyone knows that.

12:41.876 --> 12:43.042
That's not what this is,

12:41.876 --> 12:43.042
right?

12:43.083 --> 12:44.209
Because you'd have to be

12:43.083 --> 12:44.209
an idiot to think

12:44.250 --> 12:45.918
that was

12:44.250 --> 12:45.918
a medical breakthrough.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.042
Of course

12:47.000 --> 12:49.042
it's not that!

12:49.083 --> 12:50.834
You know,

12:49.083 --> 12:50.834
you seem busy.

12:50.876 --> 12:52.667
Why don't we hold off

12:50.876 --> 12:52.667
on my discovery until,

12:52.709 --> 12:55.918
say, one of us dies,

12:52.709 --> 12:55.918
hopefully you first?

12:57.000 --> 12:58.792
Nonsense.

12:58.834 --> 13:01.042
I'll carve out some time about

12:58.834 --> 13:01.042
5 o'clock to see your big,

13:01.083 --> 13:03.792
historical, not-time-wasting

13:01.083 --> 13:03.792
breakthrough.

13:08.083 --> 13:10.751
Neocortex is fading fast.

13:08.083 --> 13:10.751
We've got to do something.

13:10.792 --> 13:12.083
I know.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.959
Let's get his autograph now,

13:12.125 --> 13:13.959
before it's too late.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.292
Wait.

13:20.083 --> 13:22.292
I have a better idea.

13:22.334 --> 13:24.626
I'll do what my dad does

13:22.334 --> 13:24.626
every morning to wake me up.

13:26.626 --> 13:29.167
I made

13:26.626 --> 13:29.167
blueberry pancakes.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.751
Nothing.

13:31.083 --> 13:33.751
This isn't working.

13:33.792 --> 13:34.834
As hard as

13:33.792 --> 13:34.834
it is to believe,

13:34.876 --> 13:37.626
two Kazes are not

13:34.876 --> 13:37.626
better than one.

13:39.083 --> 13:40.083
The nuclear reactor

13:39.083 --> 13:40.083
in his brain

13:40.125 --> 13:41.292
is hyper-stimulated.

13:41.334 --> 13:43.250
He's going to explode.

13:41.334 --> 13:43.250
And if he does,

13:43.292 --> 13:45.042
he'll take out

13:43.292 --> 13:45.042
the whole hospital.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.792
We cannot let

13:45.083 --> 13:46.792
that happen

13:46.834 --> 13:48.792
because I am having

13:46.834 --> 13:48.792
a great hair day.

13:50.792 --> 13:52.042
If we're gonna figure out

13:50.792 --> 13:52.042
a way to cure him,

13:52.083 --> 13:53.751
we need

13:52.083 --> 13:53.751
a Kaz and an Oliver.

13:53.792 --> 13:56.709
And since Neocortex can't

13:53.792 --> 13:56.709
change you back to normal,

13:56.751 --> 13:58.167
I'm going to have to

13:56.751 --> 13:58.167
turn myself into you.

13:58.209 --> 14:00.042
I'm going to have to do

13:58.209 --> 14:00.042
what I do worst.

14:00.083 --> 14:02.000
Use your brain?

14:00.083 --> 14:02.000
Exactly.

14:03.375 --> 14:05.834
Okay, I just got

14:03.375 --> 14:05.834
to think like you.

14:05.876 --> 14:08.834
Okay, I'm Oliver.

14:05.876 --> 14:08.834
I'm no fun.

14:08.876 --> 14:10.834
I read and obey signs.

14:10.876 --> 14:12.667
I use the microwave

14:10.876 --> 14:12.667
as a microwave,

14:12.709 --> 14:14.292
instead of a ka-boom box.

14:15.292 --> 14:17.167
Check it out,

14:15.292 --> 14:17.167
I'm a turkey.

14:18.918 --> 14:20.876
Oliver,

14:18.918 --> 14:20.876
quit Kazzing around.

14:22.125 --> 14:24.959
Wait, do you realize

14:22.125 --> 14:24.959
what this means?

14:25.000 --> 14:28.125
I'm you and you're me.

14:25.000 --> 14:28.125
We can be a team again.

14:28.167 --> 14:30.375
All right, think of everything

14:28.167 --> 14:30.375
you know about

14:30.417 --> 14:32.667
Neocortex starting

14:30.417 --> 14:32.667
with his very first comic book.

14:32.709 --> 14:33.876
Okay, uh,

14:33.918 --> 14:36.250
"Neocortex Comics,

14:33.918 --> 14:36.250
Issue One, Copyright 1983--

14:36.292 --> 14:38.167
Oh, my gosh,

14:36.292 --> 14:38.167
flip ahead.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.167
Okay,

14:40.083 --> 14:42.167
it's a very simple plan.

14:42.209 --> 14:44.125
We just have to convince

14:42.209 --> 14:44.125
my Uncle Horace

14:44.167 --> 14:45.375
that you're not sick,

14:45.417 --> 14:47.250
and that

14:45.417 --> 14:47.250
I restored your power.

14:47.292 --> 14:49.250
And this makeup

14:47.292 --> 14:49.250
should sell the illusion

14:49.292 --> 14:50.292
that you're healthy.

14:52.918 --> 14:54.000
Perfect.

14:54.042 --> 14:55.042
UNCLE HORACE: Alan?

14:55.083 --> 14:56.667
Here comes

14:55.083 --> 14:56.667
my Uncle Horace.

14:56.709 --> 14:57.876
Remember.

14:56.709 --> 14:57.876
Eyes open wide.

14:57.918 --> 14:59.709
Big smiles.

14:57.918 --> 14:59.709
No vomit.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.042
All right, Alan,

15:00.500 --> 15:02.042
let's see--

15:02.083 --> 15:04.042
Whoa, Skylar.

15:04.083 --> 15:06.375
Very nice.

15:06.417 --> 15:08.083
It's about time

15:06.417 --> 15:08.083
you used a little makeup.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.125
Was that a sneeze?

15:11.167 --> 15:13.042
No, she just said,

15:13.083 --> 15:16.250
ah-choo impressed

15:13.083 --> 15:16.250
by Alan's miracle cure?

15:17.292 --> 15:18.876
Look at you.

15:17.292 --> 15:18.876
You're shivering.

15:18.918 --> 15:21.834
No, this is just

15:18.918 --> 15:21.834
a new dance.

15:21.876 --> 15:23.751
It's called

15:21.876 --> 15:23.751
the Philadelphia shake.

15:25.083 --> 15:28.292
The Philadelphia shake?

15:25.083 --> 15:28.292
Please.

15:28.334 --> 15:30.250
The Philadelphia shake

15:28.334 --> 15:30.250
is more like this.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.375
See? The hips?

15:37.417 --> 15:40.292
All right,

15:37.417 --> 15:40.292
continue with your

15:37.417 --> 15:40.292
presentation, Alan.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.959
As you can see,

15:44.000 --> 15:45.792
I've restored

15:44.000 --> 15:45.792
Skylar's ability to fly,

15:45.834 --> 15:48.751
thanks to my

15:45.834 --> 15:48.751
miracle cure of

15:48.792 --> 15:50.250
poultry-based

15:48.792 --> 15:50.250
water stock

15:50.292 --> 15:54.042
with doses of

15:50.292 --> 15:54.042
Hebrew balls of grain.

15:55.876 --> 15:58.042
If I didn't know

15:55.876 --> 15:58.042
any better,

15:58.083 --> 16:00.834
I'd say you just

15:58.083 --> 16:00.834
had the Normo flu.

16:00.876 --> 16:02.876
I'm going to take

16:00.876 --> 16:02.876
your temperature to be sure.

16:10.417 --> 16:11.417
Hmm.

16:11.459 --> 16:13.459
Looks like

16:11.459 --> 16:13.459
you don't have a fever.

16:13.500 --> 16:15.918
But according to this,

16:13.500 --> 16:15.918
you've been deceased

16:13.500 --> 16:15.918
for 3 days.

16:17.459 --> 16:18.751
Nice try, Alan,

16:18.792 --> 16:22.083
but Skylar's clearly just

16:18.792 --> 16:22.083
experiencing a side effect

16:22.125 --> 16:23.500
from the Normo flu.

16:23.542 --> 16:26.042
Her power's temporary.

16:26.083 --> 16:28.834
Who cares?

16:26.083 --> 16:28.834
Just certify me to fight.

16:28.876 --> 16:30.459
Sorry, I can't.

16:28.876 --> 16:30.459
I can fight.

16:28.876 --> 16:30.459
I just--

16:30.500 --> 16:33.000
Oh, Doc.

16:38.083 --> 16:40.459
Alan,

16:38.083 --> 16:40.459
I'm very disappointed.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.042
You lied to me

16:40.500 --> 16:43.042
and encouraged Skylar

16:43.083 --> 16:45.042
to endanger her health.

16:45.083 --> 16:48.125
On the bright side,

16:45.083 --> 16:48.125
it looks like she's just asleep,

16:48.167 --> 16:51.000
which is a big improvement

16:48.167 --> 16:51.000
from your last three patients.

16:55.292 --> 16:59.000
Well... thanks for nothing!

17:02.125 --> 17:04.041
I don't care

17:02.125 --> 17:04.041
what Horace says.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.584
I want my powers back.

17:04.083 --> 17:06.584
Get me sicker.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.000
I will lick the doorknob

17:06.626 --> 17:09.000
in a bus station.

17:11.334 --> 17:14.041
As much as I like

17:11.334 --> 17:14.041
watching you struggle,

17:15.541 --> 17:17.041
maybe being

17:15.541 --> 17:17.041
a healthy Normo

17:17.083 --> 17:19.000
is better than

17:17.083 --> 17:19.000
being a sick hero.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.959
You're probably right.

17:23.000 --> 17:25.917
But I will get my

17:23.000 --> 17:25.917
powers back someday.

17:25.959 --> 17:27.125
Just like I'm sure

17:27.166 --> 17:29.042
you'll find some way

17:27.166 --> 17:29.042
to impress your uncle.

17:29.083 --> 17:30.959
Thanks.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.417
And thank you for being

17:31.000 --> 17:33.417
a really bad doctor

17:33.459 --> 17:35.042
when I needed one.

17:35.083 --> 17:37.959
Hey, that's what I do.

17:43.959 --> 17:46.042
And in Issue 471,

17:46.083 --> 17:48.042
Neocortex scrambled

17:46.083 --> 17:48.042
the brain of the Black Falcon,

17:48.083 --> 17:50.167
who fell into a bottomless pit

17:48.083 --> 17:50.167
and was killed.

17:50.209 --> 17:52.042
Or <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> was </font></i> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> he?</font>

17:52.083 --> 17:53.542
So there's nothing

17:53.584 --> 17:56.584
in the entire Neocortex

17:53.584 --> 17:56.584
chronicles to help us.

17:57.959 --> 17:59.042
Wait.

17:59.083 --> 18:02.125
He guest-starred

17:59.083 --> 18:02.125
in Issue 27 of Syphonix.

18:02.167 --> 18:03.375
In that issue,

18:03.417 --> 18:05.667
Vanquisher blasted Neocortex

18:03.417 --> 18:05.667
with a pulsar beam,

18:05.709 --> 18:08.542
which started a chain reaction

18:05.709 --> 18:08.542
in Neocortex's brain.

18:08.584 --> 18:11.042
But Syphonix

18:08.584 --> 18:11.042
saved Neocortex

18:11.083 --> 18:13.626
by draining the excess energy

18:11.083 --> 18:13.626
from Neocortex's brain

18:13.667 --> 18:15.042
and discharging it

18:13.667 --> 18:15.042
into deep space.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.334
But Syphonix

18:15.083 --> 18:16.334
can't help us

18:16.375 --> 18:17.918
because he was killed

18:16.375 --> 18:17.918
in a landslide.

18:17.959 --> 18:20.125
Or <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> was </font></i> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> he?</font>

18:17.959 --> 18:20.125
He was.

18:20.167 --> 18:24.209
Or <i><font face="monospaceSansSerif"> was </font></i> <font face="monospaceSansSerif"> he?</font>

18:20.167 --> 18:24.209
Either way,

18:20.167 --> 18:24.209
he's not here.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.500
So we need to figure out

18:24.250 --> 18:26.500
a way to drain some power

18:26.542 --> 18:29.042
from Neocortex's brain

18:26.542 --> 18:29.042
before he explodes.

18:29.083 --> 18:30.918
I got it.

18:33.125 --> 18:35.667
The defibrillator?

18:33.125 --> 18:35.667
You're gonna give him

18:33.125 --> 18:35.667
more power?

18:35.709 --> 18:39.167
No. Surge, I need you

18:35.709 --> 18:39.167
to reverse the polarity

18:35.709 --> 18:39.167
of these paddles.

18:43.083 --> 18:44.292
Oliver, don't.

18:44.334 --> 18:45.500
You're going to blow up

18:44.334 --> 18:45.500
the whole hospital.

18:45.542 --> 18:47.000
Clear.

18:48.542 --> 18:49.959
Why is he levitating?

18:50.000 --> 18:51.292
I don't know.

18:51.334 --> 18:52.584
Maybe that's what people do

18:51.334 --> 18:52.584
before they explode.

18:54.375 --> 18:55.500
Now what?

18:55.542 --> 18:58.292
Kaz, give me

18:55.542 --> 18:58.292
that trampoline.

18:58.334 --> 19:00.292
Yes.

18:58.334 --> 19:00.292
Okay, wait.

19:00.334 --> 19:02.125
Why am I giving you

19:00.334 --> 19:02.125
a trampoline?

19:05.584 --> 19:07.125
Time to get

19:05.584 --> 19:07.125
leap-before-I-looky.

19:27.083 --> 19:28.083
It worked.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.000
Oliver out.

19:36.751 --> 19:39.042
Man.

19:36.751 --> 19:39.042
Is that what I'm like?

19:39.083 --> 19:40.292
Because viewed

19:39.083 --> 19:40.292
from the outside,

19:40.334 --> 19:42.000
it's not so pretty.

19:42.626 --> 19:44.334
What happened?

19:44.375 --> 19:46.709
Uh, nothing.

19:46.751 --> 19:48.751
You know,

19:46.751 --> 19:48.751
I can read your--

19:48.792 --> 19:50.042
holy cow.

19:50.083 --> 19:52.000
You almost killed me.

19:53.083 --> 19:57.042
And no,

19:53.083 --> 19:57.042
you cannot have my autograph.

19:57.083 --> 20:01.042
Man, I hate to say it,

19:57.083 --> 20:01.042
but I miss the old Oliver.

20:01.083 --> 20:02.584
So do I.

20:02.626 --> 20:04.125
Being like you

20:02.626 --> 20:04.125
is exhausting.

20:05.125 --> 20:06.459
Neocortex,

20:06.500 --> 20:08.542
can you switch my personality

20:06.500 --> 20:08.542
back to the way it was?

20:11.375 --> 20:12.709
Oh, you're not kidding?

20:12.751 --> 20:15.667
You really want that

20:12.751 --> 20:15.667
personality back?

20:16.667 --> 20:18.042
You read minds.

20:18.083 --> 20:19.584
What am I thinking

20:18.083 --> 20:19.584
right now?

20:19.626 --> 20:21.751
That you still want

20:19.626 --> 20:21.751
my autograph.

20:21.792 --> 20:22.709
I really do.

20:24.083 --> 20:25.709
Forget it.

20:25.751 --> 20:28.000
But I will change

20:25.751 --> 20:28.000
you back.

20:32.292 --> 20:34.751
I don't feel any different.

20:32.292 --> 20:34.751
I wonder if it worked.

20:38.250 --> 20:39.626
Yeah, it worked.

20:41.834 --> 20:43.751
Now I need to stop

20:41.834 --> 20:43.751
thinking like you

20:43.792 --> 20:45.042
and go back to being me.

20:45.083 --> 20:47.459
Okay, I'm Kaz.

20:47.500 --> 20:50.626
I have over 300 dollars

20:47.500 --> 20:50.626
in overdue library books,

20:50.667 --> 20:53.751
I touch things even though

20:50.667 --> 20:53.751
Oliver tells me not to,

20:53.792 --> 20:56.042
I get distracted easily,

20:53.792 --> 20:56.042
I-- ooh, a feather.

21:03.250 --> 21:04.918
Boys, turns out there

21:03.250 --> 21:04.918
was a mix-up

21:04.959 --> 21:06.626
with the previous

21:04.959 --> 21:06.626
staff rankings.

21:06.667 --> 21:07.751
But on the bright side,

21:07.792 --> 21:11.542
someone's gonna get fired,

21:07.792 --> 21:11.542
so more drama.

21:11.584 --> 21:13.667
I knew

21:11.584 --> 21:13.667
there was a mistake.

21:13.709 --> 21:15.542
Patients love me.

21:15.584 --> 21:17.417
What was I, first?

21:15.584 --> 21:17.417
Second?

21:17.459 --> 21:19.751
No, you and Kaz

21:17.459 --> 21:19.751
were tied for tenth.

21:19.792 --> 21:21.667
Turns out Dr. Levine

21:19.792 --> 21:21.667
came in first.

21:21.709 --> 21:24.000
What?

21:21.709 --> 21:24.000
Who's Dr. Levine?

21:26.584 --> 21:27.792
She is.

21:29.083 --> 21:31.500
Well,

21:29.083 --> 21:31.500
that makes sense.

21:31.542 --> 21:33.042
She can juggle.
