00:31.908 --> 00:34.747
When we're young, there's
always more to be embraced -

00:34.956 --> 00:37.259
more energy, more joy,

00:37.650 --> 00:39.625
more opportunity to flourish.

00:41.012 --> 00:45.338
We live life in forward motion,
surging ahead,

00:45.400 --> 00:47.468
eyes aimed at the horizon,

00:50.867 --> 00:55.605
And even hard labour
and sacrifice feel worthwhile

00:55.958 --> 00:59.465
when offered
up as down payment on the future.

01:09.706 --> 01:12.167
Chop chop, Jeannie.
We've a busy class ahead.

01:12.192 --> 01:14.711
It's my turn to bring in the
biscuits! I had to stop off for

01:14.736 --> 01:16.909
three packets of custard creams!

01:16.934 --> 01:19.133
Due to unforeseen circumstances,

01:19.344 --> 01:22.423
this summer's East London Keep Fit
Jamboree has had to

01:22.448 --> 01:27.137
move from its usual venue, and
we will be hosting, here in Poplar!

01:27.428 --> 01:29.027
Aren't we going up West?

01:29.028 --> 01:31.787
That church hall in Kensington was
lovely last year.

01:31.788 --> 01:34.667
Yes, but that doesn't mean
we can't offer a warm welcome

01:34.668 --> 01:36.193
and some gracious hospitality.

01:36.218 --> 01:39.097
In the meantime, we can start
setting out our stall by preparing

01:39.122 --> 01:42.772
an absolutely blistering display
routine, involving...

01:44.748 --> 01:45.961
..hula hoops!

01:57.807 --> 02:00.347
I did well today.
The foreman noticed my work.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.731
So he should. You work hard.

02:16.170 --> 02:18.210
- I don't mind.
- I do.

02:19.268 --> 02:21.947
But if I keep being noticed,
maybe they'll give me

02:21.948 --> 02:23.390
a job that pays more.

02:24.274 --> 02:27.634
Then we can afford our own place,
just the three of us.

02:32.028 --> 02:34.458
I, er, saw your mother
on the way home.

02:34.483 --> 02:35.492
Lucky you.

02:36.748 --> 02:38.233
Did she speak to you?

02:40.455 --> 02:42.055
Don't let your food go cold.

02:51.868 --> 02:53.154
Thank you, Jeannie.

02:53.948 --> 02:56.187
You can ignore the
hula hoop for now.

02:56.188 --> 02:59.227
Jeannie's softly flexed knees
and relaxed neck and shoulders means

02:59.228 --> 03:02.707
that she can concentrate all of her
energy into the lower abdomen.

03:02.708 --> 03:05.774
This exercise is particularly
good for trimming the tummy

03:05.799 --> 03:09.307
and slimming the flanks, which may
well be why Jeannie has regained

03:09.308 --> 03:12.748
her figure just a few months after
having her second child!

03:15.542 --> 03:18.206
Carry on, Jeannie,
so everyone can copy you.

03:21.148 --> 03:23.028
Gentle, rhythmic circles.

03:24.228 --> 03:25.703
That's right, Valerie.

03:26.988 --> 03:29.827
Lucille, your rotations could be
a little bolder.

03:29.828 --> 03:32.372
It doesn't feel decent
without the hula hoop.

03:34.596 --> 03:37.521
Ooh, ooh,
I've come over a bit funny.

03:37.952 --> 03:40.335
Deep breaths! Just take deep
breaths, and we'll get you to a

03:40.360 --> 03:42.610
chair. Lucille,
will you tidy away the hula hoops,

03:42.635 --> 03:44.172
and put on some Mantovani, please?

03:48.388 --> 03:50.677
It's most unwise to come
to a keep-fit class

03:50.702 --> 03:52.508
without having had anything to eat.

03:52.556 --> 03:53.788
It's finding the time.

03:54.233 --> 03:56.409
My hands are that full
with the two boys,

03:56.434 --> 03:58.815
especially now I'm back at my little
job down the shop.

03:58.988 --> 04:02.147
Only part-time, but every penny
counts with the move coming up.

04:02.148 --> 04:05.387
Oh, yes, the move!
Is it all going according to plan?

04:05.388 --> 04:08.347
Not half! Not long now till
we pick up the keys.

04:08.596 --> 04:11.987
I get the bus that way sometimes,
just so I can look at the house from

04:11.988 --> 04:13.366
the outside and say,

04:13.811 --> 04:16.411
"You're mine. We're on our way!"

04:16.677 --> 04:19.423
Frank's been working night
and day, so we've been able to save.

04:20.028 --> 04:23.081
It's funny to think there's
so much work in electrics.

04:23.222 --> 04:26.101
It's a tremendous achievement,
buying your own home.

04:26.188 --> 04:28.147
Now, come on, back to class,

04:28.148 --> 04:29.910
and next week
you're to have a proper dinner

04:29.935 --> 04:31.455
and a pudding before you come!

04:46.654 --> 04:48.651
We'll pay for this,
come the morning.

04:48.676 --> 04:51.453
Daily practice is
the key for exercise.

04:51.788 --> 04:53.817
You'd all be
better off getting up early

04:53.842 --> 04:56.202
and joining me
in my Canadian Air Force regime.

04:58.148 --> 05:00.148
I can't be doing with this!

05:00.268 --> 05:02.707
Grown men running
about in fancy dress

05:02.708 --> 05:06.267
and making out a phone box can
travel through space and time!

05:06.268 --> 05:07.947
I shall repair to my room

05:07.948 --> 05:11.547
and extend my understanding
of the Spanish intransitivo.

05:11.548 --> 05:14.490
Why don't we have a show of hands
about putting on the wireless?

05:14.515 --> 05:17.627
Oh! But it's so exciting!

05:18.650 --> 05:21.987
The Doctor's assistant has just been
mistaken for an ancient

05:22.012 --> 05:26.798
high priestess who seeks to exploit
her influence

05:26.985 --> 05:29.665
to outlaw human sacrifice!

05:30.268 --> 05:34.249
I think we will all sleep better
if we switch to the Light Programme.

05:48.315 --> 05:50.935
Look, it's your mummy. Wee-ow!

05:52.638 --> 05:53.742
How was it?

05:53.868 --> 05:56.063
I enjoy myself more every week.

05:56.308 --> 05:59.716
The teacher thinks I might be good
enough to train as an instructor.

05:59.988 --> 06:03.467
Top of the class, eh?
She's a clever one, your mum.

06:03.468 --> 06:04.668
Yeah. Oh...

06:05.948 --> 06:07.903
I finished the rewire
on Dalton Street.

06:07.928 --> 06:09.888
Well worth putting
those weekends in.

06:11.348 --> 06:14.085
It seems such a simple thing to
want for your kids, doesn't it?

06:14.110 --> 06:16.227
Yeah. But it's massive.

06:16.228 --> 06:18.787
Their own beds in their own rooms.

06:18.967 --> 06:20.764
Not something you or me ever knew.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.822
But they will.

06:32.348 --> 06:34.268
Oh, what a gorgeous girl!

06:35.908 --> 06:38.028
Hello. She's so lovely!

06:42.668 --> 06:44.947
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

06:44.948 --> 06:46.827
Good afternoon, Mrs Singh.

06:46.828 --> 06:50.067
- This weather's a treat, isn't it?
- I much prefer the cold.

06:50.068 --> 06:52.268
I find it keeps the mind sharper.

06:53.898 --> 06:55.138
Miss Higgins.

06:56.716 --> 06:58.060
Hello, Mum.

06:58.428 --> 07:00.547
You know, I've never known a mother

07:00.572 --> 07:02.894
and daughter to be
expecting at the same time.

07:03.911 --> 07:06.231
What a support
you must be for one another.

07:09.548 --> 07:11.788
If you'd like to come with me,
Mrs Singh.

07:21.468 --> 07:24.065
Are you and your mother
still at odds, Mrs Singh?

07:24.268 --> 07:26.710
She won't back down on her
feelings about Pardeep.

07:27.068 --> 07:28.772
And I'm not going to back
away from him.

07:29.031 --> 07:31.510
- So, you're caught in the middle?
- No.

07:31.644 --> 07:34.362
I'm on Pardeep's side,
and he's on my side.

07:34.988 --> 07:37.963
- That's what marriage is, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

07:40.348 --> 07:42.155
It's been a year since the wedding,

07:42.502 --> 07:44.749
and I stopped crying about her
months ago.

07:45.624 --> 07:47.220
I'm not letting it upset me.

07:48.162 --> 07:50.553
It might be upsetting
your blood pressure.

07:50.624 --> 07:51.667
What's wrong with it?

07:51.668 --> 07:53.235
It's just a little high.

07:53.629 --> 07:56.814
And there seems to be a tiny
trace of protein in your urine.

07:57.205 --> 07:59.467
What does that mean?
Is something wrong with the baby?

07:59.468 --> 08:01.225
Baby's doing very nicely.

08:01.468 --> 08:03.811
But we'll be giving you daily
checks from now on.

08:04.068 --> 08:07.027
And you're to rest,
and not get upset about your mother.

08:07.332 --> 08:08.532
I'm not upset.

08:12.119 --> 08:14.038
I was never this big the last time.

08:14.188 --> 08:16.687
As if it's not bad enough being
caught out at my age,

08:16.712 --> 08:17.929
there's no hiding it.

08:17.954 --> 08:21.753
Well, if you're uncomfortable, we
could consider a maternity girdle.

08:22.264 --> 08:24.031
I'm sure we have
one in the stock room.

08:24.228 --> 08:26.375
Second-hand? No, thank you.

08:27.212 --> 08:31.627
I can assure you we adhere to a very
strict laundry policy,

08:31.628 --> 08:33.028
and you may find it helps.

08:35.948 --> 08:38.267
Lest we need reminding, Nurse Dyer

08:38.268 --> 08:42.804
and Nurse Anderson are now off on
their tropical diseases course.

08:42.969 --> 08:46.147
We look forward to their return
as experts in leishmaniasis,

08:46.148 --> 08:48.187
malaria and sprue.

08:48.188 --> 08:52.551
In the meantime,
we have ulcers, diabetes

08:52.576 --> 08:55.707
and a post-natal list as long
as a fashion model's leg.

08:55.708 --> 08:58.637
I'm moving like a well-oiled
machine with this now.

08:59.012 --> 09:00.896
And not before time either.

09:01.148 --> 09:02.790
I'm so sorry!

09:02.815 --> 09:05.403
I had to call in at the school
and register Angela

09:05.428 --> 09:07.042
and May for their
September start, and...

09:07.067 --> 09:08.697
Well, I'm glad
everything's in order.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.239
I've written your list down.

09:10.668 --> 09:14.626
Am I right to leave Enid Wilson
on your list, Sister Julienne?

09:14.651 --> 09:18.266
Yes. I won a small victory with
a maternity girdle at clinic,

09:18.508 --> 09:22.485
and I'm hopeful I might yet persuade
her of the merits of hospital birth.

09:22.758 --> 09:24.479
She is 44!

09:24.504 --> 09:27.361
And medical guidelines
are medical guidelines.

09:27.386 --> 09:28.746
Right, off you all pop.

09:31.724 --> 09:34.690
Nurse Crane, you haven't
given me a list.

09:34.927 --> 09:35.938
Oh.

09:36.468 --> 09:38.260
Why don't you assist Mrs Turner?

09:40.748 --> 09:42.306
I'd appreciate that.

09:42.394 --> 09:43.963
We have a busy round today.

09:57.868 --> 09:59.442
The Queen had hers at home.

09:59.499 --> 10:00.614
The Queen is 37.

10:01.748 --> 10:04.154
They don't let husbands in with
you at the hospital, do they?

10:04.308 --> 10:05.839
What's husbands got to do with it?

10:06.635 --> 10:09.243
We often find men to be
more of a hindrance than

10:09.268 --> 10:11.636
- a help during delivery.
- Sounds very sensible to me.

10:11.661 --> 10:13.628
Well, it's what I want.
Shan't be dissuaded.

10:15.148 --> 10:18.027
Perhaps we could agree to
a compromise.

10:18.028 --> 10:22.102
What about having this
baby at the maternity home?

10:25.501 --> 10:27.525
Fine, if it'll put an end to it.

10:28.028 --> 10:32.006
Now we've cleared that up,
maybe we could try the girdle.

10:32.228 --> 10:34.118
You've toughened up over the years.

10:36.508 --> 10:39.587
I'll be late back, don't forget.
We're still short on drivers.

10:39.588 --> 10:42.118
No stopping off at the Hand
and Shears on the way home.

10:42.948 --> 10:43.996
Good luck, Sister.

10:50.581 --> 10:52.547
It's a good job you only
work over the way,

10:52.548 --> 10:55.227
otherwise I'm not sure we'd be able
to fit in a fitting.

10:55.228 --> 10:57.667
Well, where there's a will,
there's a way.

10:57.788 --> 10:59.823
That seems to be my motto
these days.

11:02.731 --> 11:04.067
And when you're ready,

11:04.068 --> 11:07.402
we'll have an experimental circling
of the hips, a la hula hoop mode, hmm?

11:09.268 --> 11:12.108
- Oh, I reckon that'll do!
- Hmm.

11:12.386 --> 11:13.422
Oh...

11:17.212 --> 11:18.372
I'm sorry.

11:19.668 --> 11:22.347
I've got this really funny thing
where my mouth keeps filling

11:22.348 --> 11:23.465
up with spit.

11:23.490 --> 11:26.289
It's ever so embarrassing
when I'm serving in the shop.

11:26.828 --> 11:29.415
Jeannie, have you spoken to the
doctor about this?

11:29.440 --> 11:33.016
No. It's not an illness,
it's just a bit inconvenient.

11:33.308 --> 11:36.690
Excessive saliva production
sometimes happens in pregnancy.

11:37.012 --> 11:38.012
You mean...

11:38.037 --> 11:40.367
Find out whether or not
you're expecting, yes.

11:40.935 --> 11:42.203
And if you can rule it out,

11:42.228 --> 11:44.446
then you can get on with all the
other things that you have to do.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.936
I can't be! I'm still waiting for my
monthlies to come back

11:47.961 --> 11:49.531
properly after having Mickey.

11:50.170 --> 11:51.895
And I'm using the Dutch cap!

11:56.188 --> 11:58.947
We better hurry up.
I've got to get back to work.

11:58.948 --> 12:00.922
Well, I'd suggest a trip to
Dr Turner's,

12:00.947 --> 12:02.618
to make sure that
everything's all right.

12:05.259 --> 12:06.470
How does that feel?

12:06.495 --> 12:09.095
It is more comfortable,
I'll give you that, Sister.

12:10.988 --> 12:14.345
So, you're looking after our Cilla,
then. How's she doing?

12:14.668 --> 12:17.985
I'm afraid I can't discuss
another patient.

12:18.908 --> 12:20.669
Why don't you ask her yourself?

12:21.708 --> 12:23.028
Forget I asked.

12:24.188 --> 12:26.248
I don't mean to pry, Mrs Wilson,

12:26.273 --> 12:30.803
but it seems such a shame that the
two of you are apart,

12:30.828 --> 12:32.515
particularly at such a special time.

12:33.108 --> 12:35.930
The shame is she had her head turned
by that boy in the first place.

12:36.548 --> 12:38.627
Now she's living over
there in that pigsty

12:38.924 --> 12:41.343
with goodness knows how
many strange men!

12:41.368 --> 12:42.925
Not two pennies to rub together.

12:42.950 --> 12:44.550
I mean, it's not right, is it, Sister?

12:44.872 --> 12:47.511
And I know what you're thinking,
but I'm not like some round here.

12:47.559 --> 12:49.653
This has nothing to do with
where he's from.

12:50.638 --> 12:54.327
You know, our Cilla is such a
clever, beautiful girl -

12:54.624 --> 12:56.766
she could have had anyone
she wanted, and yet...

12:56.791 --> 13:00.896
Perhaps none of that matters to her,
and Pardeep is what she wants.

13:02.028 --> 13:05.192
After all, isn't love the most
important thing?

13:05.708 --> 13:07.507
That's what she said.

13:07.508 --> 13:09.553
I know you won't believe
it to see us now,

13:09.578 --> 13:11.737
but she used to come to me
about everything.

13:11.828 --> 13:15.260
I'm not saying she always listened,
but we'd talk about it.

13:17.428 --> 13:19.837
She sounds like a young woman who
knows her own mind.

13:20.348 --> 13:24.162
If you really are worried about her,
why don't you offer some help?

13:24.588 --> 13:27.037
I'm sure the support would be
appreciated.

13:31.868 --> 13:35.079
Good news - your blood pressure has
come down a little.

13:35.668 --> 13:38.383
And your urine
is as clean as a whistle.

13:38.668 --> 13:40.274
I've been resting, like you said.

13:45.308 --> 13:48.947
Mrs Singh, have you thought about
who you'd like to have with you

13:48.948 --> 13:50.371
when the time comes?

13:50.440 --> 13:53.213
Lots of first-time
ladies like to have a family member,

13:53.238 --> 13:54.690
as well as the midwives.

13:55.428 --> 13:58.748
- I'm happy with just midwives.
- Oh, we'll take that as a compliment.

14:00.308 --> 14:03.990
Now, have you everything you
need for when baby arrives?

14:04.141 --> 14:07.340
Pardeep's found a cot from the
second-hand place down the road,

14:07.751 --> 14:10.339
and we've been trying to put
a bit by for a pram, but...

14:12.588 --> 14:15.633
..I hate the idea of the baby not
having the best of everything.

14:15.658 --> 14:17.864
When a baby has two
parents who love them,

14:17.889 --> 14:19.609
they have the best of everything.

14:26.748 --> 14:28.626
Given everything you've told me,

14:28.870 --> 14:31.618
I'd say you were around three
months pregnant.

14:33.113 --> 14:35.488
But I, I've been using the,
the Dutch cap.

14:36.028 --> 14:39.347
I followed all the instructions, did
everything the clinic told me to!

14:39.348 --> 14:42.165
Did they refit it for you, after you
had your last baby?

14:42.190 --> 14:45.456
No, um, it seemed to be
working fine as it was.

14:46.388 --> 14:48.108
I didn't want any more children!

14:48.803 --> 14:51.108
Me and my husband agreed,
two was enough!

14:51.133 --> 14:53.734
Not to mention my youngest is
only seven months!

14:53.759 --> 14:56.751
Siblings often thrive
when there's a very small age gap.

14:58.108 --> 15:00.475
Go home, tell your husband.

15:00.788 --> 15:03.092
It'll soon start
feeling like good news.

15:07.308 --> 15:09.935
There you go, Mrs Turner.

15:10.442 --> 15:13.260
Er, well, its storm apron's gone
AWOL and there's a bit of mildew

15:13.285 --> 15:15.014
in the corner, but
nothing that a damp

15:15.039 --> 15:16.875
cloth and a bit of
bleach couldn't cure.

15:16.900 --> 15:18.224
They're on their way.

15:18.249 --> 15:21.250
Are you sure your friend Nolly's
niece doesn't need this any more?

15:21.275 --> 15:23.923
Nah, the kids are grown, she was
only using it to go down the

15:23.948 --> 15:26.716
laundry. She's got one of those
twin tubs.

15:28.668 --> 15:32.427
Mrs Singh is going to be delighted.
It's in remarkable condition.

15:32.428 --> 15:35.387
Yeah, it will be, once I've given
that wheel a good seeing to.

15:35.388 --> 15:37.543
Two ticks and I'll go
and get my spoke spanner.

15:37.576 --> 15:40.695
I wish we could fix the rift between
mother and daughter as easily.

15:42.266 --> 15:44.865
I can't imagine ever falling
out with Angela.

15:45.108 --> 15:47.920
But there again, I also struggle to
imagine her grown up.

15:48.548 --> 15:52.187
A parent and tiny child could have
one sort of relationship,

15:52.282 --> 15:55.362
and two adult women of different
generations quite another.

16:01.388 --> 16:03.636
How did you find
Sister Frances today?

16:03.948 --> 16:08.183
Keen to please. Shy with me,
not so shy with the patients.

16:09.308 --> 16:12.098
I don't feel as
though I know her very well.

16:12.708 --> 16:16.229
Nor do I,
and I feel as though I ought to.

16:24.783 --> 16:27.075
Sister Frances,
have you been bitten by something?

16:27.100 --> 16:29.803
You've been clawing at your arm
ever since you sat down.

16:29.828 --> 16:33.787
I can never say no to a dog or a cat
that comes looking for affection.

16:34.190 --> 16:36.298
Do you suppose it might
have been a flea?

16:37.314 --> 16:39.708
I can see a bit of flakiness.
Let's have a proper look.

16:40.877 --> 16:44.281
Oh, please!
Not right across my cheesy tartlet!

16:44.988 --> 16:48.304
Oh, that's not a flea bite,
Sister Frances.

16:49.108 --> 16:50.257
That's ringworm.

16:54.948 --> 16:56.844
My cousin caught ringworm once,

16:57.625 --> 17:00.571
off a photographer's
monkey at the seaside.

17:01.828 --> 17:04.467
My uncle was mayor at the time,
and my auntie went mad.

17:04.704 --> 17:07.108
She said ringworm was something
dirty people get.

17:09.147 --> 17:11.107
It is something dirty people get,

17:11.108 --> 17:14.587
and if they pass it on to those of
us who are able to keep cleaner,

17:15.266 --> 17:16.413
so be it.

17:18.627 --> 17:21.867
Sister, there are so many
adjustments to make when one is new.

17:22.083 --> 17:23.169
Yes.

17:23.988 --> 17:27.507
Every day is full of things
I need to ask or remember

17:27.940 --> 17:29.580
or learn how to do.

17:29.988 --> 17:33.748
Balancing spiritual studies with
midwifery can be very hard.

17:35.239 --> 17:36.853
My door is always open.

17:37.332 --> 17:39.061
All you have to do is knock.

17:47.108 --> 17:49.028
We shouldn't have to
rely on charity.

17:49.548 --> 17:51.971
Think of it as neighbourliness,
Mr Singh.

17:54.148 --> 17:57.507
I'm sorry, Nurse.
I do not wish to sound ungrateful.

17:57.508 --> 17:59.387
We've had a bit of a disappointment.

17:59.388 --> 18:02.398
Pardeep was hoping
for a promotion at the factory,

18:03.427 --> 18:04.843
but he's been passed over.

18:06.148 --> 18:09.188
Mr Jones likes to keep
the Indians on machine work.

18:10.348 --> 18:11.663
Says we work harder.

18:16.085 --> 18:18.672
And you know what else?
He can pay them less.

18:19.921 --> 18:21.881
Try not to be discouraged.

18:25.845 --> 18:27.270
We have a visitor.

18:30.708 --> 18:31.964
Hello, Mum.

18:33.028 --> 18:35.567
- What brings you here?
- Curiosity.

18:36.348 --> 18:37.513
Is this it?

18:38.068 --> 18:40.624
Why don't I make everyone
a nice cup of tea?

18:40.649 --> 18:42.928
No, thank you.
Don't want to catch anything.

18:43.748 --> 18:47.267
My considered, professional opinion
is that Mr and Mrs Singh

18:47.268 --> 18:48.932
are managing beautifully.

18:49.668 --> 18:52.730
I think you should come home, where
we can look after you properly.

18:52.990 --> 18:54.970
She is looked after properly.

18:55.548 --> 18:57.748
And does your invitation
include Pardeep?

18:59.923 --> 19:01.579
Should've known better than to ask.

19:02.376 --> 19:04.690
Sit down, all three of you.

19:05.988 --> 19:09.547
I'll make the tea and then leave
you to talk things over as a family.

19:09.826 --> 19:10.873
Don't bother.

19:11.496 --> 19:12.951
I'll wipe my feet on the way out.

19:19.293 --> 19:20.827
I know we said we didn't want another.

19:22.121 --> 19:23.267
He or she's here now.

19:23.268 --> 19:24.450
Would a third be so bad?

19:24.475 --> 19:26.725
And what if there's a fourth one,
Frank? And a fifth?

19:26.812 --> 19:29.062
Then we'll carry on going
until we have a football team.

19:29.087 --> 19:31.249
Yeah, because that would be really
funny, wouldn't it?

19:31.274 --> 19:33.845
My mum kept popping them out
and she just sat there laughing till

19:33.870 --> 19:35.590
the tears rolled down her cheeks!

19:39.776 --> 19:40.878
I'm sorry.

19:41.548 --> 19:45.252
Look, when we've had this one,
we can double up on the contra-thingummy.

19:45.277 --> 19:46.402
Contraception.

19:46.691 --> 19:48.516
You can get something
from the clinic and I'll

19:48.541 --> 19:49.544
get something from the barber's.

19:49.545 --> 19:50.564
Frank...

19:50.908 --> 19:53.599
what if I can fix it,
so there was no "this one"?

19:54.130 --> 19:56.587
No, Jeannie. It's not legal,

19:56.588 --> 19:58.827
and it's not safe.
There's proper doctors can do it,

19:58.828 --> 20:01.547
- in the right circumstances.
- We ain't in the right circumstances,

20:01.548 --> 20:02.642
and that's that!

20:23.708 --> 20:24.942
Oh, my waters!

20:34.988 --> 20:36.430
Mrs Tennant...

20:37.668 --> 20:41.107
are you asking me to arrange
a termination of your pregnancy?

20:41.311 --> 20:43.288
If that's the polite
way of putting it,

20:43.868 --> 20:45.874
or the way a doctor would put it.

20:47.068 --> 20:49.587
I don't want to say "get rid".

20:49.588 --> 20:51.227
I don't even want to say
"abortion".

20:51.228 --> 20:54.141
I want to use... the medical words.

20:54.703 --> 20:56.156
Because this is a medical matter.

20:56.181 --> 20:58.043
And it's a matter of legality.

20:58.828 --> 21:01.135
I can't change the
law, Mrs Tennant.

21:01.160 --> 21:02.411
You can get round it!

21:02.606 --> 21:05.723
You can,
if it's a matter of life or death.

21:05.748 --> 21:07.409
My life and my death!

21:08.167 --> 21:10.549
If, if the baby's dangerous for me
and for my health,

21:10.574 --> 21:12.473
if it puts my sanity at risk!

21:12.498 --> 21:14.965
But it isn't
putting your sanity at risk.

21:15.707 --> 21:19.193
It's making you miserable
and scared and unhappy.

21:19.395 --> 21:23.414
I can see that, I,
I can see all of that,

21:25.179 --> 21:28.019
and I can look for ways
for our midwives to help you.

21:30.148 --> 21:34.059
But I can't see any medical reason
to refer you for an abortion.

21:36.645 --> 21:37.742
I'm sorry.

21:49.468 --> 21:52.308
Labour won't be too far off,
now your waters have broken.

21:53.668 --> 21:56.387
- But it hasn't started yet.
- So, can I go home?

21:56.388 --> 21:59.827
It's better you stay here, until
baby's ready to make an entrance.

21:59.828 --> 22:02.028
Erm, we can get a message
to your relatives.

22:03.942 --> 22:07.707
Straight away, if, er,
if you'd like visitors this evening.

22:07.708 --> 22:10.147
Charlie will be working
underground on the Central Line.

22:10.148 --> 22:11.676
There's no getting any
messages to him.

22:11.701 --> 22:13.647
Is there no-one else you'd like to see?

22:13.883 --> 22:15.756
No. No-one else.

22:20.748 --> 22:22.147
Right.

22:22.148 --> 22:26.728
Let us see if there are any
improvements on last week's debacle.

22:32.948 --> 22:35.108
And where is your cap, young man?

22:38.803 --> 22:41.947
And you, James Custance,
with the wrong socks on!

22:42.708 --> 22:44.028
Oh, lads!

22:45.188 --> 22:48.149
A uniform should be worn with pride.

22:48.748 --> 22:52.774
We want the Fifth Poplar looking
their best for the pack photo.

22:53.548 --> 22:57.071
Take a good look at Baloo, here -
immaculately turned out.

22:57.948 --> 22:59.398
Over by the stage.

23:00.308 --> 23:02.085
With some cunning refiguration,

23:02.133 --> 23:03.973
perhaps we can disguise
the worst of it.

23:05.388 --> 23:08.040
I've always had a keen
interest in photography.

23:08.165 --> 23:09.234
Oh, yes?

23:09.868 --> 23:12.353
In fact, I noticed there's
an exhibition on in town

23:12.378 --> 23:13.541
tomorrow evening.

23:14.268 --> 23:19.067
I hadn't picked you out as
an art aficionado, Sergeant.

23:19.068 --> 23:21.255
Oh, I try
and get along whenever I can.

23:22.948 --> 23:24.434
Maybe you'd like to come.

23:28.108 --> 23:29.500
Yeah, why not?

23:29.948 --> 23:32.305
It's always interesting to
see professional work.

23:35.508 --> 23:38.708
Pleased and proud, boys.
Pleased and proud!

23:40.708 --> 23:43.227
Mrs Tennant! Better late than never.

23:43.228 --> 23:45.404
And welcome back to the
maternity clinic.

23:46.162 --> 23:48.256
Why don't you take your boys
to toy corner?

23:48.281 --> 23:49.921
You can come straight through.

23:53.042 --> 23:55.856
Everything seems
exactly as it ought to be.

23:56.668 --> 23:58.297
I keep hoping I'll lose it.

23:58.508 --> 23:59.700
Oh, Jeannie, don't say that!

23:59.725 --> 24:01.405
I have to say it to someone.

24:03.428 --> 24:05.274
I know it isn't what you planned,

24:05.302 --> 24:06.982
But... it isn't what I wanted!

24:08.189 --> 24:12.707
Are women not allowed to want
things, or not want things?

24:13.070 --> 24:15.387
I thought it was meant to be
different for us, that we

24:15.388 --> 24:17.228
were going to be able to choose.

24:18.308 --> 24:21.050
And what I don't want,
what I would never choose,

24:21.643 --> 24:23.354
is to end up like my mother did -

24:23.948 --> 24:25.735
seven kids in 11 years,

24:25.760 --> 24:28.078
and in and out of the Linchmere with
her head falling apart!

24:28.103 --> 24:29.744
Did your mother have a nervous
breakdown?

24:29.769 --> 24:30.931
More than one.

24:31.868 --> 24:35.065
We were in foster homes sometimes,
me and the little 'uns.

24:35.948 --> 24:41.205
I've worked so hard to give Mickey
and Mark a proper chance.

24:41.838 --> 24:43.410
I was going to do better.

24:43.748 --> 24:46.274
I NEED to do better, and not for me.

24:46.828 --> 24:47.954
For my kids.

24:49.028 --> 24:51.547
I can manage two of them,
I can love two of them,

24:51.548 --> 24:55.347
but... I can't do more than that,

24:55.348 --> 24:57.640
and work, and make them a life.

24:58.308 --> 25:01.727
Jeannie, we never know what
we can achieve until we try.

25:02.908 --> 25:04.995
I can't even do the display now,
can I?

25:05.448 --> 25:07.730
I'm sure we can make some
adjustments. Now, come on.

25:09.108 --> 25:12.348
Touch up your face before you
leave the cubicle.

25:13.333 --> 25:16.836
You won't tell anyone about what
I said in here, will you?

25:17.243 --> 25:19.227
No, I won't.

25:26.228 --> 25:28.875
Have you been on your feet
a great deal, Mrs Singh?

25:28.900 --> 25:30.867
Your ankles seem a little puffy.

25:30.868 --> 25:33.682
Do they? Don't remember the last
time I saw them.

25:34.385 --> 25:37.427
I have to say,
my shoes do feel a little tight.

25:37.748 --> 25:40.507
We can have a chat about wearing
something more sensible once

25:40.508 --> 25:42.486
I've checked your blood pressure.

25:42.511 --> 25:46.246
When I was expecting,
I favoured a nice, neat lace-up.

25:46.588 --> 25:50.305
Lace-ups? I haven't worn lace-ups
since I was at school!

25:58.468 --> 26:01.267
Do you know, Mrs Singh, I'd
be much happier

26:01.268 --> 26:04.707
if we could keep you close to hand
until the baby's born.

26:05.497 --> 26:09.012
Could you reconcile yourself to
a stay at the maternity home?

26:11.388 --> 26:14.347
I wouldn't mind going somewhere
I can have a bit of peace.

26:14.348 --> 26:16.228
I shall telephone the ward.

26:39.148 --> 26:42.108
I'm pleased to say that
it's much better.

26:45.628 --> 26:47.102
So, how come you're in, then?

26:47.315 --> 26:49.507
Observation. Same as you.

26:50.228 --> 26:52.069
My offer still stands, you know.

26:53.148 --> 26:56.027
This week's Woman's Own comes
highly recommended. There's an

26:56.028 --> 26:59.053
excellent knitting feature -
"Blackberry stitch without tears" -

26:59.078 --> 27:01.323
and an offer for wipe-clean
recipe cards.

27:01.348 --> 27:03.136
Just what I'm looking for.

27:10.350 --> 27:13.979
Do you suppose we'll be rolling out
barbed wire between the beds?

27:14.198 --> 27:17.118
If they keep ignoring each other,
there won't be any need.

27:45.268 --> 27:48.358
If everyone in the class goes
bouffant for the display,

27:48.383 --> 27:51.217
we could all have coral headscarves
pinned into place.

27:51.242 --> 27:52.396
What do you think?

27:52.421 --> 27:55.260
I think it's insanity. Trying to
change our hairdos in the middle of

27:55.285 --> 27:57.884
the week?!
I set my hair on the weekend,

27:57.909 --> 28:00.428
and then I just add more
lacquer on a daily basis.

28:00.453 --> 28:02.972
The H-bomb couldn't budge
it by the weekend.

28:03.022 --> 28:05.709
Are these hairpins meant to be
sticking in my head?

28:05.813 --> 28:08.132
Lucille, have you never
heard what the French say?

28:08.367 --> 28:10.766
"A woman must suffer to be
beautiful."

28:14.108 --> 28:16.628
I think it's the dryer that's
suffered the most.

28:20.108 --> 28:21.794
I only bought this five years ago,

28:21.826 --> 28:24.145
when I had the Jean Seberg
pixie cut!

28:24.192 --> 28:26.431
Jean Seberg could dry her
hair by sticking her head

28:26.456 --> 28:27.815
out of the window of a bus!

28:27.984 --> 28:31.562
Whoa! It's a good job
I don't come bearing naked flames!

28:31.587 --> 28:33.667
You're looking very polished,
Phyllis.

28:33.668 --> 28:36.456
Where are you off to
in your next-best two-piece?

28:36.588 --> 28:39.907
An exhibition of photography,
as it happens, in Soho.

28:40.580 --> 28:43.075
Soho?! Are you sure?!

28:43.148 --> 28:45.987
I've never been one to eschew
a fresh experience,

28:45.988 --> 28:49.737
and I shall enjoy the chance to
utilise the parking meter system.

28:50.148 --> 28:53.055
One must remain in step
with the times.

28:55.708 --> 28:56.948
Ugh!

29:02.348 --> 29:05.667
Oh, this place certainly attracts
an intriguing clientele.

29:05.668 --> 29:08.707
I wasn't quite sure
I had the right address.

29:08.708 --> 29:11.488
Have I misconstrued? I thought
you were a regular.

29:11.636 --> 29:15.195
I'm a regular admirer
of the artist's work.

29:15.406 --> 29:18.163
Whilst I know nothing at all
about the gentleman.

29:18.519 --> 29:21.443
What are horizons for if not
to be expanded?

29:29.388 --> 29:31.153
Has anyone seen Jeannie Tennant?

29:32.239 --> 29:33.825
She never misses a class.

29:34.268 --> 29:35.735
Perhaps she's just running late.

29:40.708 --> 29:44.307
Where you going, love?
Phwoar, look at that!

29:44.308 --> 29:46.201
I'll show you a good time.

29:55.317 --> 29:57.435
Can I tempt you to a Murray Mint?

29:57.908 --> 30:00.925
My preference is for barley sugar.
I've brought my own.

30:09.828 --> 30:12.970
And you're a regular
admirer of this artist's work?

30:13.385 --> 30:17.905
It would appear his approach has
evolved since his last exhibition.

30:24.188 --> 30:27.787
I have to say, Sergeant Woolf,
I had thought there was no

30:27.788 --> 30:31.067
inch of the human anatomy that
I hadn't seen before.

30:31.465 --> 30:34.392
Suffice to say,
tonight has been an education.

30:34.909 --> 30:36.723
Yeah, I've learned
a lesson from it, too.

30:36.748 --> 30:37.907
What's that?

30:38.088 --> 30:41.924
Not to tell falsehoods to make
myself seem cultured.

30:42.388 --> 30:45.035
You didn't have a clue who that
photographer was, did you?

30:45.060 --> 30:46.061
No.

30:46.828 --> 30:49.597
Why were you so bothered about
seeming cultured?

30:49.622 --> 30:52.582
Oh, the arts rather passed me
by when I was younger.

30:53.512 --> 30:56.267
There's nothing wrong with having a
straight-up-and-down and sensible

30:56.268 --> 30:59.067
approach to life, if that's the way
you're made.

30:59.068 --> 31:03.446
I can only apologise if I caused
you any embarrassment or distress.

31:03.471 --> 31:05.283
No apologies required.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.805
You haven't managed to put me
off MY photography.

31:08.493 --> 31:12.147
As we seem to be forgoing the cheese
and wine through mutual agreement,

31:12.148 --> 31:15.326
should we repair to a cafe
and plan our next excursion?

31:15.508 --> 31:18.398
Thank you, but my
parking meter beckons.

31:18.423 --> 31:20.023
I must answer the call.

31:54.336 --> 31:56.455
How did you get on?

31:56.480 --> 31:58.834
Did the teacher put her feet up
and let you run the class?

31:58.859 --> 32:02.310
- Not tonight, but it won't be long.
- What's wrong?

32:03.388 --> 32:04.630
Nothing.

32:05.732 --> 32:07.948
I just overdid it with
the jumping jacks.

32:09.069 --> 32:10.629
I'll make us a cup of tea.

32:14.948 --> 32:16.028
Here we are.

32:27.668 --> 32:29.868
Can you pass me the pepper, please?

32:31.148 --> 32:32.468
Sorry.

33:09.548 --> 33:11.227
We missed you in class
the other evening.

33:11.228 --> 33:12.816
Oh, sorry, I was sick as a dog.

33:12.841 --> 33:15.036
But I'm back firing on all
cylinders today.

33:15.588 --> 33:18.605
Well, I wish I could say
the same for this.

33:18.715 --> 33:21.717
We've been through so much together.
Please tell me it's not terminal.

33:21.742 --> 33:24.827
Leave it with us. A few days' bed
rest ought to put it right.

33:24.828 --> 33:26.957
The sooner you can discharge it,
the better.

33:27.252 --> 33:30.606
I had to dry my hair by a two-bar
electric heater last night.

33:32.628 --> 33:35.226
You still look a little
green about the gills, Jeannie.

33:35.708 --> 33:37.692
Have you tried ginger
biscuits for the nausea?

33:38.028 --> 33:39.919
I'll stick with my custard creams,
thanks.

33:47.188 --> 33:49.405
And that's five minutes
since the last one.

33:49.588 --> 33:51.075
Things are coming along nicely.

33:51.208 --> 33:52.190
Come here, chick.

33:52.215 --> 33:53.585
Let me straighten those pillows.

33:53.713 --> 33:55.574
I thought the pain was
all in your stomach.

33:55.868 --> 33:57.820
Nobody told me it hurts your head!

33:57.875 --> 33:59.203
Have you got a headache, Cilla?

33:59.228 --> 34:01.490
Yeah, and my eyes
have gone all funny.

34:01.515 --> 34:04.067
It's like I keep seeing little
silver sparks.

34:04.588 --> 34:07.027
I'm going to take your blood
pressure,

34:07.028 --> 34:10.590
and perhaps Nurse Dyer would pop
and fetch Dr Turner.

34:10.806 --> 34:12.059
What for?

34:12.558 --> 34:14.418
I just want him to take
a look at you.

34:16.987 --> 34:19.014
Having seen the blood pressure
charts, I think

34:19.040 --> 34:20.513
we all know what this is.

34:20.917 --> 34:22.440
Can someone get me an aspirin?

34:23.068 --> 34:24.697
Feels like my head's in a vice!

34:24.723 --> 34:27.739
Cilla, it looks as though you have
something called toxaemia.

34:27.764 --> 34:30.623
Just for now, we're going to move
you to a side room

34:30.648 --> 34:32.813
where you can rest
quietly in the dark,

34:33.348 --> 34:35.507
and we can give you something to
help you sleep.

34:35.507 --> 34:37.706
But I don't want to! I want Pardeep!

34:37.942 --> 34:41.806
Please, can somebody tell him?
He works at Haywards Paints.

34:43.868 --> 34:44.947
It's all right.

34:44.973 --> 34:47.772
If you can prepare the sedative,
I'll call the Flying Squad.

34:48.050 --> 34:49.308
Let's get her transferred.

34:57.619 --> 34:59.179
Sorry I'm late, love.

35:03.213 --> 35:05.002
Where's your mum, eh?

35:06.198 --> 35:08.988
Where's your mummy? Sshhhh.

35:11.407 --> 35:12.907
Oh, love.

35:14.590 --> 35:17.076
Shhh. What's wrong?

35:17.238 --> 35:18.889
My stomach's off.

35:20.114 --> 35:22.955
It was like this once in a while
when I was having the others.

35:23.971 --> 35:25.427
You never had a temperature.

35:25.428 --> 35:27.594
I'll look after the lads,
you go and have a lie down.

35:38.370 --> 35:43.369
Doctor, is my wife here?
Her name is Mrs Cilla Singh.

35:43.820 --> 35:46.867
- They told me the baby is coming.
- Yes, it is.

35:47.273 --> 35:48.508
I'm glad you're here.

35:48.708 --> 35:51.540
Is she well?
Is everything as ought to be?

35:51.565 --> 35:53.143
What's happened?
Where's my daughter?

35:53.168 --> 35:55.684
Cilla is suffering from toxaemia.

35:55.709 --> 35:58.067
Toxaemia?! I had that
when I was having her!

35:58.668 --> 36:00.631
Is, is that a sickness?

36:00.656 --> 36:01.664
Yes.

36:01.689 --> 36:04.107
With a bit of extra help,
all will be well.

36:04.108 --> 36:06.767
Don't you go making out it's nothing!
I nearly died when I had her!

36:06.792 --> 36:09.620
Please, Doctor, can I see my wife?

36:09.645 --> 36:11.900
We'll look after her,
I promise you.

36:12.108 --> 36:13.628
You can look after each other.

36:26.788 --> 36:28.467
You're getting worse.

36:28.468 --> 36:32.028
- You're as hot as fire.
- I'm cold!

36:33.308 --> 36:35.427
I think we should call the doctor.

36:35.568 --> 36:36.571
No.

36:36.634 --> 36:39.380
- It's not you, it's the little 'un.
- No!

36:40.388 --> 36:41.391
What can I do?

36:43.008 --> 36:44.807
Get in next to me.

36:45.943 --> 36:47.375
Help me to get warm.

36:58.626 --> 37:00.375
I've just spoken to St Cuthbert's.

37:00.400 --> 37:02.463
The Flying Squad hasn't
even set off,

37:02.496 --> 37:04.412
because there wasn't
an obstetrician free.

37:04.464 --> 37:05.605
So, what will we do?

37:06.428 --> 37:09.546
We'll deliver her here,
under sedation.

37:19.388 --> 37:21.565
It's never easy,
when a mother cries out in pain,

37:21.590 --> 37:24.112
but when she's silent
it seems so unnatural.

37:24.348 --> 37:26.243
Local anaesthesia effective?

37:32.168 --> 37:33.648
Contraction.

37:38.148 --> 37:39.762
I can see the head.

37:41.010 --> 37:44.115
Going in gently with the forceps.

37:45.868 --> 37:47.319
Good girl, Cilla.

37:58.244 --> 37:59.825
- Episiotomy.
- Good girl.

38:01.942 --> 38:03.680
She's still under, OK?

38:17.388 --> 38:18.480
Mission accomplished.

38:18.752 --> 38:20.386
A bonny little boy.

38:28.460 --> 38:30.503
Come on, soldier.
Time to do your bit.

39:02.575 --> 39:05.245
How about that for teamwork, eh,
Master Singh?

39:22.639 --> 39:24.319
Oh, my goodness!

39:31.468 --> 39:34.108
Jeannie! Jeannie!

39:38.393 --> 39:39.517
Mr Singh?

39:42.628 --> 39:44.119
You have a son.

39:45.165 --> 39:46.249
A son?

39:47.797 --> 39:49.271
How is my wife?

39:49.670 --> 39:51.462
We're still keeping
a close eye on her,

39:51.948 --> 39:54.400
but she's sedated,
and therefore sleeping.

39:55.238 --> 39:57.080
Which is why I thought
this young gentleman

39:57.105 --> 39:59.434
might want to
make your acquaintance.

40:07.518 --> 40:09.681
It is the answer to my prayers,

40:10.190 --> 40:13.700
that he is here,
and his mother has survived.

40:16.628 --> 40:18.497
You are so skilled in medicine.

40:19.028 --> 40:20.426
I am thankful.

40:22.824 --> 40:27.560
But I think perhaps
your prayers were the same.

40:29.748 --> 40:32.053
God is good, Mr Singh.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.405
My granny used to say that.

40:44.068 --> 40:45.503
Dr Turner's surgery.

40:51.748 --> 40:53.228
Doctor, she's upstairs!

41:02.834 --> 41:04.753
Can you hear me, Mrs Tennant?

41:05.336 --> 41:08.126
Mrs Tennant? It's Dr Turner.

41:08.151 --> 41:09.908
I need you to wake up for me.

41:12.525 --> 41:13.780
Come on, Jeannie.

41:17.355 --> 41:19.151
Will I get into trouble?

41:19.176 --> 41:20.576
No, Jeannie. No, you won't.

41:21.988 --> 41:24.987
What's happening?
Is she losing the baby?

41:25.283 --> 41:28.627
Mr Tennant, could you
call for an ambulance? Quickly.

41:28.628 --> 41:29.871
Tell them it's urgent.

41:30.615 --> 41:32.735
I need you to tell me
when this happened.

41:34.033 --> 41:35.673
Two days ago.

41:37.435 --> 41:38.873
Did the baby come away?

41:40.925 --> 41:42.725
I thought I'd feel better.

41:44.268 --> 41:46.628
You, have a very nasty infection.

41:47.639 --> 41:49.278
I'm giving you some penicillin.

41:49.599 --> 41:50.794
Small scratch.

41:52.588 --> 41:54.831
Then we're going to get
you to the hospital,

41:55.442 --> 41:56.761
they'll do the rest.

42:15.428 --> 42:17.028
Oh, look who's awake.

42:18.428 --> 42:20.508
It's no fun all on your own, is it?

42:22.456 --> 42:24.576
How about we keep each other
company, eh?

42:28.525 --> 42:30.884
Oh, there we go.

42:41.618 --> 42:43.380
It's going dark...

42:47.268 --> 42:49.922
Look at me, Jeannie!
Jeannie, look at me!

42:57.208 --> 43:02.507
Don't... don't close your eyes,
Jeannie. Listen to me, Jeannie.

43:02.508 --> 43:04.867
Now, don't close your eyes.

43:05.297 --> 43:06.977
Faster!

43:21.442 --> 43:23.747
Come on, Jeannie! Come back!

43:23.748 --> 43:25.148
Come back!

43:28.908 --> 43:31.428
Come on, Jeannie, come on!

44:02.148 --> 44:04.307
I know, I know, I should be in bed.

44:04.308 --> 44:05.599
Got my slippers on.

44:05.948 --> 44:08.404
I have no objection to you sitting
with your grandson.

44:11.988 --> 44:14.710
Cilla was left on her own
the night she was born.

44:15.952 --> 44:18.133
Can't tell you how guilty
I felt about that.

44:18.437 --> 44:19.816
It wasn't your fault.

44:20.068 --> 44:21.441
You were very ill.

44:22.067 --> 44:23.965
She was on her own again tonight.

44:24.398 --> 44:25.795
I weren't ill this time.

44:26.932 --> 44:28.915
I was just stubborn.

44:33.232 --> 44:35.146
I'll watch over him for her.

44:35.171 --> 44:37.870
Just for now,
so she knows he weren't by himself.

44:39.358 --> 44:40.912
I'm sure that can be arranged.

45:11.091 --> 45:12.482
I don't understand.

45:13.296 --> 45:15.171
My sister lost one
and she was all right.

45:16.229 --> 45:19.030
Your wife's case was... complicated.

45:21.028 --> 45:23.308
This didn't happen naturally.

45:25.830 --> 45:27.815
Jeannie came to me the other day.

45:28.854 --> 45:30.861
She asked for a termination.

45:31.292 --> 45:34.269
I, I couldn't refer her -
there weren't the grounds.

45:35.472 --> 45:38.334
But it seems she tried to
arrange things herself.

45:38.545 --> 45:40.447
She came to you?

45:40.653 --> 45:42.613
She came to you,
and you sent her away?!

45:55.810 --> 45:59.590
Do you suppose she went to the same
abortionist as Cath Hindman?

45:59.615 --> 46:02.657
Both of them seem to have caught
streptococcus infections.

46:02.682 --> 46:05.387
Sister Frances, I don't care who
poor Jeannie went to, I'd just like

46:05.388 --> 46:07.767
to get my hands round the filthy
woman's neck and wring it!

46:10.180 --> 46:11.660
I'll see who it is.

46:15.348 --> 46:20.129
What I don't understand is,
is how they know who to ask.

46:20.828 --> 46:21.959
The pregnant women.

46:21.984 --> 46:24.703
How do they know where to go,
if it all goes on in secret?

46:24.868 --> 46:30.336
Child, do you ask how the fish in
the murk of the ocean finds the light?

46:31.689 --> 46:34.725
How the rat in the rubble
locates the air?

46:34.750 --> 46:38.630
In extremis, necessity finds a way.

46:39.068 --> 46:42.908
It has always been thus,
it will always be thus.

46:44.903 --> 46:46.543
Sergeant Woolf is here.

46:47.756 --> 46:49.175
He wants to talk to Trixie.

47:02.256 --> 47:05.507
Patrick? Patrick,
shall I make more coffee?

47:05.508 --> 47:08.399
Oh, no, I'm heading off in a minute.

47:08.446 --> 47:09.989
I'll have some
if he doesn't want any.

47:10.360 --> 47:13.479
I've told you before, percolator
coffee isn't good for you!

47:13.628 --> 47:16.195
Tea's quite strong
enough for a teenage boy.

47:16.289 --> 47:19.037
Now, upstairs, all three of you.

47:19.062 --> 47:21.707
Timothy's in charge
of supervising teeth.

47:21.708 --> 47:23.827
I'm planning to be a
doctor, not a dentist.

47:23.852 --> 47:25.491
Teeth, now. Spit spot.

47:34.890 --> 47:37.197
There's nothing in the
paper yet, is there?

47:37.335 --> 47:38.214
No.

47:38.855 --> 47:42.766
And if and when there is, it will
only merit a column inch or so.

47:44.302 --> 47:47.703
It won't say anything about the two
little children she left behind,

47:47.728 --> 47:51.627
or, or the look on her husband's
face when he knew that she was gone.

47:51.628 --> 47:54.787
I won't have you blaming yourself
for that poor woman's death.

47:55.110 --> 47:57.710
You didn't make the law,
you obeyed it.

47:57.884 --> 48:00.404
And you did everything you
could to save her.

48:01.429 --> 48:02.989
Yes, last night.

48:04.190 --> 48:06.841
But the truth is
I failed her weeks ago.

48:08.039 --> 48:09.789
I gave her no choice.

48:09.814 --> 48:12.250
YOU had no choice!

48:20.535 --> 48:25.439
If you can shed any light at all
on Mrs Tennant's thoughts

48:25.548 --> 48:27.774
or movements, anything...

48:28.485 --> 48:30.485
I'll tell you everything that
I know.

48:31.508 --> 48:33.507
Jeannie was unhappy.

48:33.508 --> 48:35.587
Jeannie was frightened.

48:35.588 --> 48:38.237
Jeannie did not want to have a baby.

48:39.108 --> 48:42.587
And I can also tell you that we
see this all the time.

48:43.353 --> 48:45.667
Young, young girls.

48:45.668 --> 48:47.427
Exhausted older women.

48:47.428 --> 48:49.656
Mothers who don't know
where their next penny

48:49.681 --> 48:51.726
or their next beating's coming from!

48:51.751 --> 48:56.630
And others who want to take control
of their bodies and their lives!

48:57.680 --> 48:59.867
And all we can do is pat them
on the hand

48:59.868 --> 49:01.620
and say "You'll manage,
everybody does."

49:02.108 --> 49:03.955
But not everybody does!

49:04.391 --> 49:06.071
Not everybody believes us.

49:08.068 --> 49:10.468
I'm so sorry, I can't help you.

49:12.095 --> 49:14.349
But I'm even more sorry that
I couldn't help her.

49:18.942 --> 49:20.662
I am so proud of you.

49:23.028 --> 49:25.267
I'm sorry I wasn't with you
last night.

49:26.260 --> 49:28.467
He was well cared for.

49:28.468 --> 49:30.340
Thank you, Sister.

49:30.684 --> 49:33.723
Don't thank me,
thank his grandmother.

49:34.068 --> 49:35.556
My mum was with him?!

49:43.080 --> 49:44.635
He won't go to bed without Jeannie.

49:47.311 --> 49:53.347
I keep saying, "She's coming,
she's coming,"

49:53.744 --> 49:55.908
but it ain't true,
and I know he knows it.

49:57.588 --> 50:01.107
If there's anything at all
that you can remember that you can

50:01.108 --> 50:03.907
pass on to us,

50:03.908 --> 50:05.547
anything she said,

50:05.548 --> 50:07.948
any hint she dropped,
even accidentally...

50:10.108 --> 50:11.868
I know it cost £7.

50:14.882 --> 50:16.616
Because that's what's
missing from the pot.

50:18.508 --> 50:21.308
BABY CRIES Hey, sshhh, sshhh.

50:23.998 --> 50:25.758
I don't know this woman's name.

50:27.450 --> 50:28.970
I don't know where she lives.

50:30.548 --> 50:34.228
But I know she charges, £7.

50:41.588 --> 50:45.134
Thank you, for looking after him,
Mum.

50:48.188 --> 50:49.878
I thought I'd lost you.

50:50.425 --> 50:52.399
When I think what our last
words might've been...

50:52.424 --> 50:53.429
You didn't lose me.

50:54.441 --> 50:55.636
I'm right here.

50:57.183 --> 51:00.968
It's something... when they put them
in your arms, isn't it?

51:02.249 --> 51:05.260
I knew straight away I'd do
anything to keep him safe

51:06.268 --> 51:07.508
and to give him the best.

51:09.424 --> 51:10.804
I understand, Mum.

51:11.628 --> 51:13.713
I've been the worst sort of fool.

51:13.995 --> 51:16.972
So fixed in my ideas, I forgot
what's important.

51:18.318 --> 51:19.360
I'm sorry...

51:20.308 --> 51:21.587
..to both of you.

51:39.030 --> 51:41.309
Are the Underground still
looking for drivers?

51:41.404 --> 51:43.683
I think the lad's a bit young yet,
Enid.

51:43.708 --> 51:45.183
I was thinking more of his dad!

52:00.222 --> 52:02.308
Oh, I'm sorry, Sister Julienne.

52:03.092 --> 52:06.024
I didn't mean to
interrupt your private devotions.

52:06.548 --> 52:08.870
No. Come and join me.

52:08.895 --> 52:11.905
Sometimes prayer is like any other
form of conversation -

52:12.958 --> 52:14.918
better with more than one voice.

52:19.828 --> 52:20.993
You may lead us both.

52:23.009 --> 52:27.267
Almighty and everlasting God,
give unto us the...

52:27.268 --> 52:30.787
..increase of faith, hope and
charity.

52:30.788 --> 52:34.787
Make us to love that which
thou dost command.

52:34.788 --> 52:37.228
Through Jesus Christ our Lord,
amen.

52:38.708 --> 52:42.507
My huge apologies, Sister. Enid
Wilson's labour is progressing

52:42.508 --> 52:44.428
and only you will do.

52:48.148 --> 52:50.147
She don't look well, Sister,
she really don't.

52:50.148 --> 52:52.347
Are you sure there's nothing wrong?

52:52.348 --> 52:54.787
This is normal labour, Mr Wilson.

52:54.788 --> 52:56.427
Keep it going, Enid,

52:56.428 --> 52:58.387
right through to the end.

52:59.762 --> 53:01.684
- Well done.
- Oh, blimey!

53:01.709 --> 53:03.738
Can we do that thing with the
flannel again, on your head?

53:03.763 --> 53:05.481
No! You keep getting
water in my ears!

53:05.514 --> 53:07.900
Do you want to move to the
end of the bed, so you can see?

53:08.028 --> 53:09.293
No, I'm sorry, I don't.

53:09.318 --> 53:12.278
You think he'd be used to the sight
of things coming out of tunnels!

53:13.443 --> 53:15.021
Are you feeling quite well,
Mr Wilson?

53:15.046 --> 53:18.005
Because if you're not, may I suggest
you step outside for a little air?

53:18.329 --> 53:19.969
Enid has work to do.

53:29.068 --> 53:33.304
Keep pushing, that's it!
There, there!

53:33.953 --> 53:35.889
Is it out yet? Is it out?

53:35.914 --> 53:40.427
Not yet, but you're doing
so wonderfully well.

53:41.045 --> 53:43.027
I think we'll have baby
on the next one.

53:43.255 --> 53:46.229
Just one push, Enid -
hold Cilla's hand.

53:47.130 --> 53:48.753
I don't know what
you're doing in here.

53:48.823 --> 53:49.888
Come on, Mum.

53:49.973 --> 53:51.941
You show me how it's done.

53:51.966 --> 53:54.022
I've had a baby, and
I'm none the wiser!

53:54.047 --> 53:55.200
Oh, you did all right.

53:58.788 --> 54:00.040
Keep, keep going.

54:00.634 --> 54:04.249
- That's it, push.
- Come on, Mum! Come on, Mum!

54:04.588 --> 54:08.057
- Come on!
- I've got the head. - Come on!

54:11.566 --> 54:14.027
You have a daughter.

54:14.942 --> 54:16.255
A beautiful daughter.

54:16.280 --> 54:17.325
And a sister.

54:37.628 --> 54:40.508
Hello! Oh, hello!

54:42.950 --> 54:45.124
Does this mean this one's
been born an aunt?

54:45.285 --> 54:47.715
I can't make head nor tail of it!

54:48.768 --> 54:50.243
Oh, hello!

55:06.348 --> 55:10.588
Some have no horizon left to run to.

55:12.708 --> 55:17.188
Those left behind must
walk on as best they can.

55:18.428 --> 55:21.649
And things that were once
part of the present,

55:21.674 --> 55:26.174
and the future,
speak all too loudly of the past.

55:27.307 --> 55:31.112
Do we lay them down, or love them?
Let them live?

55:32.948 --> 55:35.861
Love is never the only answer,

55:35.900 --> 55:38.355
but it is always the best,

55:38.708 --> 55:44.549
the simplest, the one most likely to
withstand the test of time.

55:47.268 --> 55:51.110
The solution we remember when the
question has been laid down,

55:51.500 --> 55:53.498
all quarrels put aside.

55:55.052 --> 55:56.966
Love is the beginning.

55:57.388 --> 55:59.348
It should be the final word.

56:12.846 --> 56:15.041
Everyone ticked off,
all present and correct.

56:15.236 --> 56:16.447
Except one.

56:17.920 --> 56:20.067
I can take her place in the display.

56:20.068 --> 56:22.842
I can smooth over
the gap in the routine,

56:23.288 --> 56:25.707
and it will look all right, but...

56:25.732 --> 56:26.800
But...

56:27.437 --> 56:28.832
it's all wrong, isn't it?

56:33.156 --> 56:34.414
Come on.

56:35.078 --> 56:36.287
Let's do it for her.

56:46.447 --> 56:49.823
There are always shadows,
but they fall behind us.

56:50.523 --> 56:53.525
Echoes, but they fade upon the air.

56:54.708 --> 56:57.565
You will sometimes
forget, but not always.

56:58.828 --> 57:01.346
Go forward in joy.

57:06.097 --> 57:07.443
I don't want to.

57:08.375 --> 57:09.390
Hello?

57:09.415 --> 57:12.258
- Cyril Robinson.
- He wants to be a dad so badly!

57:14.495 --> 57:16.931
You and your assistance has
ruined my daughter's life!

57:16.956 --> 57:18.760
This is all your fault!

57:18.785 --> 57:21.259
She deserves your respect,
not your anger.

57:21.284 --> 57:22.972
I am here to work, Cyril,

57:22.997 --> 57:25.237
and I cannot allow myself to
get distracted.
