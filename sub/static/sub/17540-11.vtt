(gasp)

00:16.249 --> 00:17.349
The jewel-bilee!

00:19.786 --> 00:22.354
Mm-hmm!

00:23.457 --> 00:24.656
<i> (female wailing)</i>

00:24.691 --> 00:27.325
OMG.
Something's really wrong!

00:27.360 --> 00:28.493
I'm freaking out here!

00:28.528 --> 00:30.529
Whatever it is,
our friends need our help!

00:31.798 --> 00:36.001
Ahh! My dance number
is ruined!

00:36.036 --> 00:37.602
Is everybody okay?

00:37.637 --> 00:41.239
(hair dryer humming)
(shivering voice)
Uh-huh.

00:41.274 --> 00:42.340
What happened?

00:42.375 --> 00:44.376
Zevon, Yzma's son.

00:44.411 --> 00:45.744
He's here?

00:45.779 --> 00:47.679
Yeah, and he had
Jafar's staff,
and he was like,

00:47.714 --> 00:51.750
ka-blam, ka-pow, I'm here
for the revolt-a-lution,
whatever that is.

00:51.785 --> 00:55.220
Then he stole the jewels
and he was all, like,
ba-bam, ba-boom,

00:55.255 --> 00:57.122
and now he wants
to take over Audadon.

00:57.157 --> 00:59.257
-Excellent summation.
-Thanks.

00:59.292 --> 01:02.094
(hair dryer humming)
Does anyone know
where Zevon went?

01:02.129 --> 01:03.428
Nobody's seen him.

01:03.463 --> 01:04.596
E, mirror.

01:05.966 --> 01:07.299
-Hmm.
-Evie?

01:07.334 --> 01:10.068
Right.
Mirror, mirror, in my hand.

01:10.103 --> 01:12.304
where is Zevon
in our land?

01:14.341 --> 01:17.876
There he is!
On the Tourney Field.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.277
Okay, you guys!

01:19.312 --> 01:21.913
The only way
we can stop Zevon
is by working together.

01:21.948 --> 01:22.981
Let's go!

01:23.016 --> 01:24.783
You want us to follow you?

01:24.818 --> 01:26.485
After what you did?

01:26.520 --> 01:28.120
I know. I was mean.

01:28.155 --> 01:30.822
I mean, I was more than mean,
I was evil.

01:30.857 --> 01:32.757
I'm... so sorry.

01:32.792 --> 01:34.626
Apology not accepted.

01:34.661 --> 01:36.094
Apology rejected!

01:36.129 --> 01:38.997
Like an ugly stepsister
with size 12 feet!

01:39.032 --> 01:40.499
Ooh, burn.

01:40.534 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, she got roasted.

01:42.035 --> 01:45.437
You ruined everything,
and put us all in danger.

01:47.174 --> 01:48.573
-She's right.
-Mal...

01:48.608 --> 01:50.008
This was my fault.

01:50.043 --> 01:52.410
If I hadn't gone back
to the isle looking
for my jewel...

01:52.445 --> 01:54.179
There's no way
you could've known.

01:54.214 --> 01:57.282
Look, Mal didn't do this.
Zevon did.

01:57.317 --> 01:58.950
He turned us
against each other.

01:58.985 --> 02:00.519
He divided us.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.922
And on top of that
Jane, Freddie, Jay,
and Carlos are missing.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.491
(exhales)
I can finally feel my feet.

02:06.526 --> 02:07.359
I'll go find them.

02:07.394 --> 02:08.493
(hair dryer turning off)

02:08.528 --> 02:11.696
(sigh)
We can only
stop Zevon together.

02:11.731 --> 02:13.532
I can't do this one alone.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.667
Hmph.

02:15.702 --> 02:17.302
Sorry, Mal.

02:17.337 --> 02:20.338
Hha. Okay. I guess
we're doing it alone.

02:20.373 --> 02:21.473
Come on.

02:26.880 --> 02:29.281
(crackling and booming)

02:29.316 --> 02:31.550
(gasp)
I think we may be too late.
