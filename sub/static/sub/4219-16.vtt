WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.044
She ain't a good fit, Casey.

00:03.170 --> 00:05.838
She thinks she's untouchable
because of who her dad is.

00:05.964 --> 00:07.590
CFD's not right for everyone.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.676
That's what I've been trying
to teach my daughter.

00:09.802 --> 00:12.762
I want to be a firefighter.
I got a taste of it, and I liked it.

00:12.888 --> 00:16.182
I worry about you every time
you get on that ambulance.

00:16.308 --> 00:18.184
A truck was going to be that times ten.

00:18.852 --> 00:21.771
Vince Keeler's gonna make a clean
getaway. And I can't live with that.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.189
I want in.

00:23.315 --> 00:26.275
Nobody's heard from Keeler since last
night. Seems he's gone missing.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.745
Thanks for coming in.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.123
We've got to follow-up on this
while there's still a chance

00:40.249 --> 00:41.541
to find Keeler alive, so...

00:41.667 --> 00:44.127
You warned me not to do anything
to Keeler. I took your advice.

00:45.254 --> 00:47.922
- I've warned people before.
- Fine. Great.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.133
Where are...
Where are we doing this?

00:50.259 --> 00:52.760
I won't be doing the interview.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.429
Hey, Kelly.

00:58.684 --> 00:59.684
So...

01:01.061 --> 01:02.395
Wednesday night.

01:03.897 --> 01:04.897
I was home.

01:05.023 --> 01:06.941
- The whole time?
- That's right.

01:07.067 --> 01:10.778
Er, what about your roommate,
er, Leslie Shay?

01:10.904 --> 01:13.448
- Out with friends.
- She your girlfriend?

01:13.574 --> 01:16.367
Probably would be
if she wasn't a lesbian.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.162
- Anyone come over to visit?
- No. No one came over to visit

01:19.288 --> 01:22.373
cos the scumbag who hurt my sister
was out on the streets, free as a bird.

01:22.499 --> 01:24.208
I wasn't in a very social mood.

01:29.506 --> 01:30.715
I got to ask the questions.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.595
Why don't you talk to the cop
who sprang Keeler from jail?

01:36.597 --> 01:37.847
Or, maybe it was you.

01:40.100 --> 01:43.519
It's unforgivable what Keeler did.

01:45.522 --> 01:50.193
But unless you come up with
a better alibi, you're a suspect.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.992
OK! The suggestion box
on what I should get Cindy

01:58.118 --> 02:00.161
for our 20th anniversary is now closed,

02:00.287 --> 02:03.748
cos I figured out
the perfect gift all on my own.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.252
A vasectomy.

02:13.550 --> 02:17.011
- Has she been after you to get one?
- Nah! It never came up.

02:17.137 --> 02:21.224
- It's gonna be a surprise.
- Mazel tov.

02:21.350 --> 02:24.644
- Thanks, Chief.
- You're seriously going to surprise her

02:24.770 --> 02:28.189
with the fact that you got snipped
without her knowing about it first?

02:28.315 --> 02:31.609
Yeah, cos we're soul mates, jackass.
And that's what soul mates do.

02:31.735 --> 02:33.861
Have you met your wife?

02:33.987 --> 02:36.656
She's that very Catholic lady
that sleeps next to you.

02:36.782 --> 02:40.034
She was in labour for 18 hours
with kid number five.

02:40.160 --> 02:43.037
She'd be doing back flips over this
if she, you know,

02:43.163 --> 02:45.456
hadn't put on
a little extra baby weight.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.209
- Bad idea.
- Shut it, Mouch.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.552
What do you think of Jefferson Park?

02:57.678 --> 03:00.054
Erm, I don't really
get up there much. Why?

03:00.180 --> 03:02.473
I got a great lead on a townhouse.

03:02.599 --> 03:06.811
Two bedrooms, one and half baths,
hardwood floors, parking in back.

03:06.937 --> 03:11.065
Killer pub on the corner. On the nights
we don't support Molly's, of course.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.901
- Baby.
- Yeah?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.695
There were two things
I said I didn't want.

03:15.821 --> 03:19.282
To be more than 30 minutes from work
and live in a townhouse.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.493
- We talked about this.
- Right, right. Yeah, of course.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.162
I'll... I'll come up with
some more options.

03:25.289 --> 03:30.501
- We're gonna find a great place.
- OK. Erm...

03:30.627 --> 03:31.919
Well, I'm pretty free tomorrow.

03:32.045 --> 03:35.089
I just have to stop by the Academy
and register for the next physical.

03:35.215 --> 03:38.634
Er, you'll have to wait till they
announce the next Academy class.

03:38.760 --> 03:40.219
Could be a while.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.142
You know, I'm still planning
on being a firefighter.

03:46.268 --> 03:50.229
I know you are.
And I totally support it.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.743
Clarke.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.454
You, too.

04:19.885 --> 04:23.346
- Anyone from CPD talk to you?
- No.

04:23.472 --> 04:26.641
The whole Keeler thing?
We never had that conversation.

04:26.767 --> 04:29.226
- We don't talk about it again.
- OK.

04:39.488 --> 04:43.157
- Were you just over at the District?
- Yeah.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.451
Something happening with the Keeler
case? Did he turn up?

04:45.577 --> 04:47.161
- Not that I heard.
- Well, what'd they say?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.579
Do they have any theories?

04:48.705 --> 04:52.500
Otis, I don't know.
They don't CC me on the memos.

04:53.502 --> 04:55.461
Let me know if you hear anything.

04:58.507 --> 05:01.050
Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambo 61.

05:01.176 --> 05:03.803
Car accident, 19th and Ashland Avenue.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.527
No sign of the driver.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.821
Truck 81, put that fire out
and get a chain on the other car.

05:21.947 --> 05:24.615
Squad 3, make sure
no one's in the basement

05:24.741 --> 05:26.033
and evacuate that building.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.411
All right, Cruz and Jones,
help me stabilize the car.

05:28.537 --> 05:30.538
Herrmann and Mouch,
get CO2 on that fire.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.873
Mills, you're
in the basement with me.

05:33.000 --> 05:34.375
Right.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.345
Fire Department!
Anybody here, call out!

05:49.599 --> 05:52.435
Help! In here!

05:56.356 --> 05:59.900
Severide, there's a female victim
and a baby in the basement.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.319
I hear a man,
but I don't see anybody else.

06:02.446 --> 06:04.238
Help! Quick!

06:04.364 --> 06:06.657
Hey, we got him. We got...
Get them out of here!

06:06.783 --> 06:09.660
- I got the baby.
- She's stuck under debris.

06:12.581 --> 06:13.581
Casey!

06:24.301 --> 06:27.928
This is my fault. I swerved to avoid
a dog and I hit this car.

06:29.139 --> 06:31.140
We've got
to get you out now, OK?

06:36.605 --> 06:38.022
Take him.

06:41.610 --> 06:42.777
Got it?

06:44.071 --> 06:45.279
Whoa.

06:46.156 --> 06:48.032
- Come on, guys!
- Got it. Yeah!

06:49.159 --> 06:50.284
Whoa! Watch out!

06:51.244 --> 06:52.787
Look out!

06:52.913 --> 06:54.872
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

06:54.998 --> 06:56.540
The wall's giving!

06:56.666 --> 06:57.875
Cruz! Go get the chain.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.464
Coming in!

07:11.056 --> 07:13.057
Got it! Go, hook it up!

07:18.939 --> 07:20.648
Hurry!

07:28.448 --> 07:30.533
I got you. All right.

07:31.451 --> 07:32.952
That's OK! Little bit harder!

07:33.078 --> 07:35.079
Coming out. All clear!

07:44.089 --> 07:45.214
She's gonna make it.

08:01.898 --> 08:03.816
Best Denver omelette I've ever had.

08:03.942 --> 08:05.067
It's your recipe.

08:05.193 --> 08:09.572
Like I said, best Denver omelette
I've ever had.

08:10.574 --> 08:13.993
Hey, you're doing a good job.
And I don't just mean the cooking.

08:14.911 --> 08:16.412
Thanks.

08:17.706 --> 08:20.666
You know, I know that I didn't make
a great first impression around here.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.378
Trust me, I...
I know how these guys are.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.214
I was in your shoes not too long ago.
And...

08:27.340 --> 08:30.009
There's like this circle of trust.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.595
And you're way on the outside of it.

08:32.721 --> 08:34.889
So, how do I get on the inside?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.807
Don't wait to be invited.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.351
You make the first move. Break the ice.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.522
I got to do a grocery run.
Thanks for the advice.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.703
Spit it out, Cruz.

08:59.372 --> 09:01.248
OK.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.833
Herrmann, look.

09:02.959 --> 09:07.254
All due respect,
a lot of your big ideas go south.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.842
The discount phone card,
the energy water, the limo service.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.427
Yeah. Your point?

09:13.553 --> 09:16.263
- Well, we just feel...
- We? Who's we?

09:16.389 --> 09:18.432
- Not me. Not me.
- Me and Mouch.

09:20.393 --> 09:24.563
Maybe the whole surprise vasectomy thing
is a little...

09:25.565 --> 09:26.523
Not good.

09:26.650 --> 09:30.945
Oh! Are we laying everybody's bad ideas
on the table? Is that what we're doing?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.656
Oh! OK, all right. Hang on.
Erm, how about you, Mouch?

09:33.782 --> 09:35.407
You do anything stupid, like,
I don't know,

09:35.533 --> 09:38.285
wear some red panties that your Internet
Japanese girlfriend sent you?

09:38.411 --> 09:40.120
All right! Keep it clean, Herrmann.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.664
You can do what you want.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.290
You're damn right I will!

09:43.416 --> 09:46.293
And you know what? I got the whole
extended family coming to Molly's

09:46.419 --> 09:48.504
Saturday night for
the anniversary party.

09:48.630 --> 09:50.339
I already have Saturday reserved.

09:50.465 --> 09:53.175
What? You, er... You didn't tell me.

09:53.301 --> 09:54.885
I posted it on the Molly's website.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.888
I have this whole tapas party
I'm gonna throw for my extended family.

09:58.014 --> 09:59.932
- Nice.
- Molly's has a website?

10:02.602 --> 10:04.478
Hello?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.819
Hey, you got a second?

10:16.408 --> 10:19.702
Hey, er, so,
Detective Lindsay just called.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.870
She wants me to come in for questioning.

10:21.997 --> 10:23.706
- OK.
- She's cool, right?

10:23.832 --> 10:25.833
She's a friend of yours?

10:27.043 --> 10:28.961
Otis, is there something
you wanna tell me?

10:29.254 --> 10:31.338
Cos if so, don't tell me.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.132
- I... I'm just...
- Hey, Chief.

10:33.258 --> 10:36.343
Hey. Detective Lindsay get a hold of
you? She called the office line earlier.

10:36.469 --> 10:39.722
Yeah, yeah. She, er...
She got through. Thanks, Chief.

10:39.848 --> 10:42.933
- This regarding Vince Keeler?
- Er, yeah.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.938
Ambulance 61, person down...

10:48.064 --> 10:50.607
- That's ambo.
- Ah.

10:52.861 --> 10:54.945
Something going on here
I need to know about?

10:55.071 --> 10:56.947
They're interviewing everybody who had

10:57.073 --> 11:00.159
any contact with Keeler
before he went missing.

11:05.415 --> 11:07.041
OK.

11:09.753 --> 11:11.670
I just... I...

11:27.937 --> 11:30.731
- Excuse us. Paramedics coming through!
- Move out of the way, people!

11:30.857 --> 11:32.691
Let them through!
I came out to throw out my trash

11:32.817 --> 11:34.818
and found him stumbling around
all shot up like that.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.237
Then he just fell down!

11:37.364 --> 11:40.574
Agonal breathing,
pulse is weak and thready.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.701
Let's get him in the ambo.

11:45.830 --> 11:47.581
- 61 to Main.
- Go ahead, 61.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.667
Our patient's a gunshot victim. We're
gonna need a beat car assigned ASAP.

11:50.794 --> 11:52.795
Copy that, 61.

11:52.921 --> 11:55.714
- Looks like they grazed his ear.
- Yeah, he's lucky it wasn't worse.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.592
Main to 61, do you copy?

11:58.718 --> 12:00.010
What's up, Main? We're busy here.

12:00.136 --> 12:01.678
You need to leave
the scene immediately.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.222
We're still stabilizing the victim.

12:03.348 --> 12:05.349
But you can let Chicago Med
know that we're on our way.

12:05.475 --> 12:09.311
Now, Dawson. I've got you on the street
cam. You guys have company.

12:12.357 --> 12:14.274
Hey, hey, hey!

12:16.861 --> 12:20.697
- Main, where's our backup?
- Open the door!

12:20.824 --> 12:22.616
A beat car hasn't been
assigned yet, Dawson.

12:22.742 --> 12:26.537
I'm activating a 10-1 response
to all available CPD in your area.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.205
Now! Open the door, bitch!

12:33.420 --> 12:33.460
Open the door!

12:33.461 --> 12:34.962
Open the door!

12:35.088 --> 12:36.463
Open the damn door.

12:37.590 --> 12:40.467
- Pulse is fading fast!
- How long till the cops get here?

12:40.593 --> 12:43.262
Listen to me. You can't wait for the
cops. You need to get out of there.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.265
Negative. We need two minutes to keep
him from going into cardiac arrest.

12:46.391 --> 12:49.476
You don't have two minutes. 50 yards
west of you, the street dead ends

12:49.602 --> 12:53.313
into Karlov Avenue. Dawson,
take the rig and make a left. Go now.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.320
- Open up!
- Hey, listen, OK?

13:00.447 --> 13:02.656
Listen, this guy's in really bad shape,
OK?

13:02.782 --> 13:06.285
Just let us get him bandaged to stop
the bleeding, and we'll let him go.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.745
Then we'll be on our way,
no questions asked.

13:08.872 --> 13:12.082
- Let him out of the ambulance, first!
- OK, whatever you say. Just relax!

13:12.208 --> 13:15.335
- Open the door!
- Open the damn door!

13:15.462 --> 13:16.420
Open up!

13:17.380 --> 13:19.590
Open up!

13:23.470 --> 13:24.928
Get in the car!

13:41.571 --> 13:44.114
- Dawson!
- Yeah, I see them!

13:44.240 --> 13:47.284
OK, you're approaching an
alley. Take the first left before it.

13:47.410 --> 13:50.621
Wait, wait, wait! No, no, no! That's not
a street. That leads into a warehouse.

13:50.747 --> 13:54.124
- There's nowhere to go.
- Trust me. Go to the loading dock.

13:54.250 --> 13:55.709
Main, are you sure about this?

13:55.835 --> 13:58.128
Thugs will be there
in five seconds. Move!

14:19.442 --> 14:22.236
- You take the head. I'll grab an IV.
- Got it.

14:22.362 --> 14:26.323
Oh, my God. Now, I know
why this guy's so popular.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.953
Lung sounds diminished.
He's circling.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.412
OK, I'm gonna use an IO drill.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.165
It's the only way we'll buy enough time
to get him to the ER alive.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.292
Dawson, they're coming back.

14:55.687 --> 14:57.688
They're coming.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.906
OK, line's in! Let's get out of here!

15:10.076 --> 15:11.410
Yo!

15:25.383 --> 15:28.218
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon! Do it now!

15:28.344 --> 15:30.929
Hands out the car!
Out the car! Don't move!

15:31.055 --> 15:34.641
Turn around! Turn around! Turn around!

15:34.767 --> 15:37.769
Face down
on the hood! Spread them!

15:41.774 --> 15:44.443
Gabriela Dawson. Ninja paramedic.

15:44.569 --> 15:47.613
We owe you a beer.

15:57.373 --> 15:59.791
Hey, we heard. You guys OK?

15:59.917 --> 16:02.836
Just when I thought I'd seen it all.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.463
Hey.

16:04.589 --> 16:07.299
- I'm so glad you are all right.
- Thanks.

16:08.593 --> 16:11.845
Yeah. Hey, so listen. On Saturday night,

16:11.971 --> 16:14.264
it's not like I can switch
my anniversary date,

16:14.390 --> 16:18.060
so could you move the sangria night,
or, you know, whatever you call it?

16:18.186 --> 16:20.687
Tapas. And no, man, I can't.

16:20.813 --> 16:23.690
I've got family coming in from New York
specifically for this tasting.

16:23.816 --> 16:27.694
Then you know what?
We'll make it a combo party.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.696
This is a joke, right?

16:29.822 --> 16:34.451
No. I'm getting a surprise vasectomy
for our 20th anniversary.

16:35.620 --> 16:38.288
And you wanna announce this
at Molly's on Saturday

16:38.414 --> 16:40.707
- when my friends and family are there?
- Correct.

16:40.833 --> 16:42.292
Not in a million years.

16:42.418 --> 16:43.960
Everybody, I need you in the kitchen.

16:49.425 --> 16:51.885
Er, what's going on here?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.887
Jones has an announcement to make.

16:54.013 --> 16:57.891
Yes. Could I have the guest of honour
right here, please?

17:04.774 --> 17:07.818
To commemorate Herrmann's last day
of producing sperm.

17:07.944 --> 17:12.739
It'll keep producing sperm.
It's just not going to make it to my...

17:12.865 --> 17:14.616
- Oh, boy.
- What?

17:14.742 --> 17:16.743
Ugh.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.917
- Yep.
- Is that a rocket blasting off?

17:30.550 --> 17:32.342
So I guess the 20th anniversary gift
is wood?

17:37.682 --> 17:39.850
Er, you know what,
I think we're good here.

17:39.976 --> 17:44.062
And everybody should just, er,
get back to work. Come on.

17:56.284 --> 17:57.784
Chief.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.163
I'm, er... I'm heading down
to the 21st District.

18:01.289 --> 18:03.957
I notified Casey.

18:04.083 --> 18:07.377
Well, as Shakespeare reminds us,

18:07.503 --> 18:09.421
"Brevity is the soul of wit."

18:10.715 --> 18:12.716
Thank you, Chief.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.178
I'm a little unclear on that one.

18:16.304 --> 18:17.679
Don't get too chatty, Otis.

18:39.494 --> 18:41.203
The night that Katie was abducted,

18:41.329 --> 18:44.414
her phone records show
that her last call was to you.

18:44.540 --> 18:45.999
That's right. Yeah.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.627
What was the call about?

18:48.753 --> 18:50.879
We were gonna meet up later.

18:51.005 --> 18:55.467
- So you were dating?
- Yeah, yes.

18:55.593 --> 18:58.553
Have you seen Vince Keeler
since the blackout?

18:59.555 --> 19:01.640
Yes.

19:01.766 --> 19:03.433
Where did you see him?

19:03.559 --> 19:05.227
It was in front of his house.

19:05.353 --> 19:09.231
Er, I... I drove by.

19:09.357 --> 19:13.360
- Did you talk to him?
- No. I just drove by.

19:15.154 --> 19:19.157
- He went missing later that night.
- I know. I know.

19:20.368 --> 19:24.454
- Where were you later that night?
- I grabbed a beer

19:24.580 --> 19:29.459
and I, erm... I went and I sat on
a bench overlooking the lake.

19:29.585 --> 19:33.171
- In March?
- I was upset.

19:41.013 --> 19:43.014
Give me a minute.

19:48.020 --> 19:50.021
What do you wanna do?

19:51.023 --> 19:53.024
I wanna know what happened.

19:54.819 --> 19:58.196
All right, I'll kick him for now,
then I'll do a full work up on him.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.375
- You wanted to see me, Chief?
- Yes, Jones, shut the door.

20:13.629 --> 20:17.299
A formal complaint
has been lodged against you.

20:17.425 --> 20:20.427
- What'd I do?
- Three guesses.

20:20.553 --> 20:22.387
- The cake?
- There you go.

20:22.513 --> 20:24.097
That was a joke.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.933
A joke that I paid for with
my own money, by the way.

20:27.059 --> 20:28.310
And Herrmann loved it.

20:28.436 --> 20:31.104
We love a good prank, believe me.
That's not the issue.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.606
So what's the issue?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.900
It's about what's appropriate
in the workplace.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.776
You thought it was funny, Lieutenant.

20:36.903 --> 20:39.112
You're the one who made
the wood comment!

20:39.238 --> 20:42.532
Good point. All yours, Chief.

20:42.658 --> 20:45.577
Technically, you've been accused of
creating a hostile work environment.

20:45.703 --> 20:48.622
A hostile... Where's this coming from?

20:48.748 --> 20:50.457
It's an anonymous complaint.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.626
Unfortunately, I have to write up
an incident report

20:52.752 --> 20:57.255
and put it in your union file.
That'll be all.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.973
Does her dad know?

21:07.099 --> 21:09.893
Yeah, and he wants
to see us after shift.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.106
Have a nice day, Rebecca.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.117
Got any big plans today?

21:27.495 --> 21:31.164
- Nope.
- Do you need anything, brother?

21:32.124 --> 21:33.917
Because if you do, just let me know.

21:39.298 --> 21:45.845
- Actually, er, I do need something.
- Yeah, name it.

21:47.723 --> 21:52.143
I may need you to tell the cops we were
hanging out last Wednesday night.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.395
What?

21:53.521 --> 21:59.025
Look, I had nothing to do with Keeler
disappearing, OK? Nothing.

21:59.151 --> 22:02.404
But there... There's just no one
to vouch for where I was.

22:02.530 --> 22:04.948
Would you, er...
Would you do that for me, Joe?

22:13.749 --> 22:14.874
Whatever you need.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.432
Uh...

22:30.558 --> 22:32.225
Hello. Hi.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.061
Er, I'm looking to talk to somebody
about the firefighter test?

22:35.187 --> 22:37.480
- Gabriela Dawson, right?
- Yeah.

22:37.606 --> 22:40.650
I thought you quit.

22:40.776 --> 22:45.071
Erm, no, didn't quit,
just didn't finish the physical test.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.489
I heard you quit.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.452
OK, look, I just need
to retake the test.

22:50.578 --> 22:52.245
I heard there was gonna be one
next month.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.747
Er, yeah, that class is closed.

22:53.873 --> 22:55.999
You're gonna have to wait
until they announce a new class

22:56.125 --> 22:58.084
and apply with them.

22:58.210 --> 23:00.253
But, that could...
That could take a year.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.010
- Dennis Fackler.
- Pardon.

23:07.136 --> 23:09.596
Three years ago, Dennis Fackler
was allowed to recover

23:09.722 --> 23:13.099
from a bronchial infection and
he took the test again six weeks later.

23:13.225 --> 23:16.269
- I don't know anything about that.
- But Chief Tiberg does.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.937
Because it was under his watch.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.112
These are all my certifications.

23:26.238 --> 23:28.448
I completed all the required
firefighter practicals,

23:28.574 --> 23:30.533
which means that I completed
my Academy training,

23:30.659 --> 23:32.285
except for the physical.

23:32.411 --> 23:35.705
So, according to the precedent
set by Dennis Fackler,

23:35.831 --> 23:39.292
I should be allowed to retake the
challenge test with the current class.

23:39.418 --> 23:42.420
And believe me, I will not fail.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.060
Fill this out.

24:04.860 --> 24:09.280
- So, no pain?
- Nah, it's kind of a tingle.

24:10.533 --> 24:14.911
But it's permanent.
It's the nuclear option.

24:19.458 --> 24:24.337
No sane person could blame you
for not wanting another kid.

24:24.463 --> 24:26.339
I'd love to have another kid.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.967
But I love the five we got so much

24:29.093 --> 24:33.179
that I can't imagine taking
any more time away from them

24:33.305 --> 24:35.306
to give to someone else.

24:37.893 --> 24:39.811
My heart is full, Mouch.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.984
- You're a lucky guy, Herrmann.
- Yeah.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.905
There's nothing like being a dad.

24:53.325 --> 24:54.784
Nothing like it, Mouch.

25:14.722 --> 25:19.309
I heard about Rebecca's stunt yesterday.
I wish I could say I was surprised.

25:19.435 --> 25:21.394
She's new.
Just trying to fit in with the guys.

25:21.520 --> 25:24.230
- We get where this is coming from.
- That's very charitable.

25:24.356 --> 25:27.400
If this is about the IR against her,
we didn't have a choice.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.819
- When a complaint is filed, we...
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

25:29.945 --> 25:32.030
Look, our PR director is leaving.

25:32.156 --> 25:35.408
When he's gone, Rebecca will have
a nice job waiting for her here.

25:35.534 --> 25:40.246
Chief, she's no problem at 51.
We're all really glad that she's there.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.833
Would you want your only daughter
to be a firefighter?

25:43.959 --> 25:46.211
She wanted to go to the Academy,
get on a truck.

25:46.337 --> 25:49.964
She's been to the Academy. She's
been on a truck. But we're done now.

25:52.384 --> 25:54.552
- When is she being transferred?
- Next month.

25:54.678 --> 25:57.639
And I need your help.
You need to DQ her.

25:57.765 --> 26:01.434
Use the cake, use whatever,
but give her the boot.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.646
She won't transfer
if it comes from me.

26:04.772 --> 26:07.649
- Isn't this a decision she should make?
- Not really.

26:07.775 --> 26:09.359
I really think
if you give her some time...

26:09.485 --> 26:13.488
Look, I'll say it one more time.
She's moving over to Headquarters.

26:21.205 --> 26:23.456
- Here.
- Not on the table.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.084
No liquids. If I spill anything on
one of these forms, I'm screwed.

26:26.210 --> 26:29.212
OK. Is this OK, or farther?

26:30.005 --> 26:32.465
That's fine.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.677
You have to write an essay?

26:35.803 --> 26:39.013
Er, yeah, my second one so far.

26:40.641 --> 26:43.893
I can get you into this physical
with one phone call.

26:44.019 --> 26:47.230
- How?
- I got an in with Jones' dad.

26:49.024 --> 26:52.235
- Why?
- OK.

26:54.446 --> 26:59.325
This did not come from me.
Wow, look at you. Gossip.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.453
- Give me the gossip.
- Shut up. Tell me. Tell me.

27:03.622 --> 27:07.917
He wants her out.
He's got some PR gig lined up.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.669
- Does she want that?
- Who knows?

27:09.795 --> 27:13.339
Me and Boden have to find a way
to ding her.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.508
Will you?

27:15.634 --> 27:18.344
I'm not going down this road again.

27:18.470 --> 27:21.097
Honestly, I thought you'd be happy
to hear that she's leaving.

27:21.223 --> 27:22.932
What, by forcing her behind a desk?

27:23.058 --> 27:27.061
Do not tell her.
This is between her and her dad.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.947
Did you?  Let me see.

27:38.073 --> 27:39.365
Yeah, I do. Seriously.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.617
- Hey.
- Hey, Pop.

27:41.744 --> 27:44.871
You've got to try this. It's craziness.
It's a fish called crappie.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.665
And, er, I've already made
all the jokes.

27:49.084 --> 27:51.377
Any more on the Keeler of it all?

27:51.503 --> 27:53.546
I'm good.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.548
But now, they're looking at Otis.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.551
What? Give me a break with that.
Otis, seriously?

27:58.677 --> 28:01.179
I mean, in a multi-player video game
maybe he'd kill someone.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.556
- It's ridiculous!
- Yeah, well, still.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.516
He ain't telling them anything
they wanna hear.

28:05.642 --> 28:08.394
No. Just tell him to keep his mouth shut
from here on out.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.980
Oh. This fish is unbelievable.

28:11.106 --> 28:15.401
Is that for real? You actually go out on
a lake and you cut a hole and you fish?

28:15.527 --> 28:17.653
Like, what's the...
What's the trick?

28:17.780 --> 28:21.199
You just dress warm and don't get bored?

28:21.325 --> 28:22.367
Never go out alone.

28:25.245 --> 28:28.122
Bad things can happen if you get caught
out in the wild alone.

28:43.222 --> 28:45.056
I need a pillow.

28:52.147 --> 28:54.565
Here you go, sweetie.
Right there.

28:55.317 --> 28:58.027
OK. OK.

28:58.153 --> 29:00.446
Er, Cindy must have noticed something.

29:00.572 --> 29:06.035
Yeah, I told her I got hit in the nuts
by some kid at a safety demonstration.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.287
I thought it was pain-free.

29:08.414 --> 29:12.417
Er, yeah. You know, in doing a little
Internet research last night,

29:12.543 --> 29:15.711
I... I guess there is a significant
percentage of vasectomy patients

29:15.838 --> 29:17.213
who experience pain.

29:17.339 --> 29:21.050
You got to tell her. Right now.
Don't wait for Saturday.

29:21.176 --> 29:24.053
Nah. I come this far.

29:24.179 --> 29:26.055
Herrmann, I'm asking you nicely.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.224
Please let me have Molly's. Please.

29:28.350 --> 29:31.060
I'm telling you, unexpected combo party.

29:31.186 --> 29:34.647
You bring the peanut butter,
I got the chocolate. Boom!

29:34.773 --> 29:36.983
Peanut butter cups! Oh!

29:38.026 --> 29:41.612
OK, all right.
Well, what am I in for exactly?

29:41.738 --> 29:44.157
Did the urologist record the procedure
and you're gonna, like,

29:44.283 --> 29:45.867
put it up on the flat screens?

29:45.993 --> 29:49.078
I got it all worked out.
It's gonna be fine.

29:49.204 --> 29:52.457
- Bad idea.
- Shut it, Mouch.

29:54.793 --> 29:57.295
Two shifts and already
I got a stain on my record.

29:57.421 --> 29:59.881
- Did you go back in?
- To Boden? No, I was waiting for him...

30:00.007 --> 30:03.509
No. No, don't wait.
Oh. OK, this is what you got to do.

30:03.635 --> 30:05.178
And I'm gonna be very specific

30:05.304 --> 30:07.096
cos I think I was a little
too vague last time.

30:07.222 --> 30:09.223
And that went a little south on us.

30:11.018 --> 30:13.686
- OK.
- OK.

30:13.812 --> 30:17.106
Stand there, look him in the eye,
take full responsibility,

30:17.232 --> 30:19.400
and tell him that it will never
happen again.

30:19.526 --> 30:23.321
OK? No excuses, no nothing.
Just take the hit.

30:23.447 --> 30:26.949
I've been on that carpet, and believe
me, this is what he responds to.

30:30.245 --> 30:32.288
- Thanks.
- Sure.

30:40.839 --> 30:43.716
What can I do for you?

30:43.842 --> 30:46.844
- Is Sergeant Voight here?
- No, he's out.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.892
May I borrow your pen, please?

30:57.022 --> 30:59.565
Would you please tell him that, er,

30:59.691 --> 31:02.735
Benny Severide would
like to talk to him,

31:02.861 --> 31:06.322
and that, er, he can reach me
at this number?

31:06.448 --> 31:08.157
You got it.

31:26.093 --> 31:27.969
Hey!

31:28.095 --> 31:30.096
Up here! We're stuck!

31:30.889 --> 31:33.266
Jones, Herrmann, Otis, Cruz with me!

31:33.392 --> 31:36.102
Severide, check the bottom floor
for damage.

31:56.498 --> 31:59.625
Thank God, you're here.
The stairwell just fell apart.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.794
- We'll get you down.
- There's another guy.

32:01.920 --> 32:05.214
He was in the stairwell
when it collapsed.

32:05.340 --> 32:06.549
Down there.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.469
Hey, can you hear me?

32:13.932 --> 32:16.809
We've got to work fast. There's a victim
trapped on a column that looks weak.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.644
All right, should we get the rope system
up?

32:18.770 --> 32:21.647
No time. There's no anchor point.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.817
I'll lower one of you down.
And we'll secure him with webbing.

32:24.943 --> 32:28.070
Lieutenant, send me down. That's at
least 30 pounds less you have to bear.

32:33.785 --> 32:34.952
All right.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.166
Herrmann, Otis,
take these guys down the aerial.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.426
OK, stop. Hold it there.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.975
Casey, a little more.

33:02.564 --> 33:04.440
OK, hold it there.

33:16.203 --> 33:19.830
Be ready when this guy comes
down. Clear a path to get him out.

33:26.296 --> 33:29.507
OK. I've transferred the victim
to your rope, Lieutenant.

33:29.633 --> 33:31.592
When I cut his clothes free,
you can lower him down.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.803
Jones, stay on the rope.
It's too dangerous.

33:33.929 --> 33:35.638
Look, this guy's
circling the drain.

33:35.764 --> 33:38.349
He can go first.
I'll hang around for the next ride.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.315
OK, let him down, Casey.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.902
Severide, he's coming your way.

33:52.114 --> 33:53.239
Watch it.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.452
Watch it now.

33:58.578 --> 34:01.372
All right. We got him.

34:01.498 --> 34:03.708
Jones!

34:07.462 --> 34:08.879
Jones! Status.

34:09.881 --> 34:11.382
I'm OK, Chief.

34:11.508 --> 34:14.343
Building's a little wobbly.
It's still coming apart.

34:14.469 --> 34:17.638
OK, hold your position.
We're gonna send in a RIT team.

34:23.895 --> 34:26.063
OK, stop it there. I can reach it.

34:32.279 --> 34:35.030
Jones! You all right?

34:36.032 --> 34:36.907
Yeah!

34:44.332 --> 34:46.459
Steady, Jones.

34:48.503 --> 34:50.504
Take your time.

35:04.102 --> 35:06.812
I'm back on the rope.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.939
All right, Casey. Get me out of here.

35:10.942 --> 35:12.777
Easy.

35:14.654 --> 35:15.946
Watch it.

35:19.117 --> 35:21.118
We got her.

35:25.165 --> 35:29.627
I grew up wanting nothing else
in my life but this job.

35:29.753 --> 35:36.217
And now that I'm actually doing it,
it's better than I imagined.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.636
I don't wanna compromise
my future here.

35:38.762 --> 35:41.847
So I hope that you will both accept
my sincere apology

35:41.973 --> 35:46.811
for my inappropriate behaviour.
It won't happen again.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.566
Very good, Jones.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.030
Oh.

35:58.156 --> 36:01.575
Are we really gonna do this?

36:01.701 --> 36:05.663
Her father is Deputy District Chief.

36:05.789 --> 36:08.040
He could make me work in PR
if he wanted to.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.917
This is gonna be like killing Bambi.

36:10.043 --> 36:12.461
You have his office number.

36:12.587 --> 36:15.172
You are welcome to give him a call
if you like.

36:21.805 --> 36:23.639
So, what now?

36:29.813 --> 36:31.647
Go home.

36:36.194 --> 36:38.195
Just do me a favour.

36:40.198 --> 36:42.616
Stay out of Chicago for a while, OK?

36:45.829 --> 36:46.954
OK.

36:52.836 --> 36:55.212
You're a good dad, Benny.

37:38.673 --> 37:42.009
OK, great. Thank you. Bye!

37:42.135 --> 37:45.137
Babe, I got in! I'm gonna take the
physical with the current class!

37:45.263 --> 37:48.974
- Congrats, babe.
- Thanks, babe.

37:49.100 --> 37:53.270
Oh, I turned those request forms in
just in time, right?

37:53.396 --> 37:55.773
Hell, yeah, you did.

37:55.899 --> 37:58.609
Did... Did you call Jones' dad?

37:59.486 --> 38:02.905
- I did.
- Why?

38:03.823 --> 38:05.783
Because you're my girl.

38:05.909 --> 38:09.662
I love you and I didn't want you to get
boned on this over some red tape.

38:18.505 --> 38:20.297
That's hot.

38:24.469 --> 38:27.638
Close your eyes.
No peeking. Come on.

38:27.764 --> 38:29.556
Don't peek.

38:30.892 --> 38:32.559
Happy anniversary!

38:41.945 --> 38:43.237
OK.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.114
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Not the cake. Not the cake.

38:45.240 --> 38:47.408
That train has already left
the station, baby.

38:47.534 --> 38:50.035
Hey, ladies, gents,
can I have your attention for a sec?

38:50.161 --> 38:54.039
Erm, Cindy,

38:54.165 --> 38:56.834
thanks for the 20 best years
a guy could ever ask for.

38:56.960 --> 39:00.671
- Aw!
- Thank you, sweetheart.

39:02.757 --> 39:05.050
And to mark this day,

39:05.176 --> 39:08.053
I wanted to do something
special for you.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.847
And for us.

39:09.973 --> 39:11.682
So...

39:14.561 --> 39:17.354
I got a vasectomy!

39:33.872 --> 39:36.290
How'd I get so lucky?

39:36.416 --> 39:38.375
What the...

39:38.501 --> 39:41.086
Never a doubt. Never a doubt!

39:52.766 --> 39:54.558
What part of the cake did you get?

39:54.684 --> 39:57.269
Mmm, I think the epididymis. You?

39:57.395 --> 40:00.105
Corpus spongiosum.

40:00.231 --> 40:02.232
First time I've ever had
that in my mouth.

40:02.358 --> 40:04.485
- Oh, yeah? How is it?
- Eh.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.655
- Gabriela Dawson.
- Mmm.

40:08.782 --> 40:12.493
- Ninja paramedic.
- Oh! You must be Main.

40:12.619 --> 40:14.828
Ramsey. Victor Ramsey.

40:19.834 --> 40:23.921
Wow. It's nice to put
a face to the voice.

40:24.047 --> 40:27.925
- I'm here for that beer you owe me.
- Oh! Right.

40:28.051 --> 40:29.843
Yeah, I... I'll get it for you.

40:31.054 --> 40:34.473
I never got a chance to say,
welcome back to ambo.

40:34.599 --> 40:36.934
I didn't see you for a while.

40:37.060 --> 40:40.479
Yeah, you know what, I'm sorry.
We're really swamped tonight.

40:40.605 --> 40:45.150
It's so nice to meet you. Er...
And we'll talk later. Bye.

40:49.072 --> 40:51.740
Hey. So, good news.

40:51.866 --> 40:56.328
Erm, Lindsay called.
I guess both of our alibis checked out.

40:56.454 --> 41:00.457
And they've exhausted all of the leads,
so it's now a missing persons case.

41:01.876 --> 41:04.962
- Cool.
- Is it?

41:05.088 --> 41:09.299
Cos, you know, that means
Keeler's still out there somewhere.

41:11.845 --> 41:13.679
He ain't out there any more, Otis.
