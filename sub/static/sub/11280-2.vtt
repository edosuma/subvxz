CHRIS ROCK:
At 14, I decided I wasn't gonna
just let things happen to me

00:07.308 --> 00:08.676
like they did before.

00:08.709 --> 00:10.344
I was going to get
some dignity.

00:10.378 --> 00:12.213
I was going to take charge.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.281
Hey...!

00:13.314 --> 00:15.383
Little dude
from across the street.

00:15.416 --> 00:16.750
I know, I know.
You want a dollar.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.219
Thanks, little dude.

00:18.252 --> 00:19.220
I know what you're thinking--

00:19.253 --> 00:20.654
I just got robbed.

00:20.688 --> 00:22.490
But he didn't steal
that money from me,

00:22.523 --> 00:25.059
I gave it to him.

00:25.093 --> 00:27.595
I didn't wait for my father
to make me go get a job,

00:27.628 --> 00:30.064
I went out and got one myself.

00:30.098 --> 00:35.269
I didn't mind sweeping,
but the pedicures had to stop.

00:35.303 --> 00:37.171
Nice job.
Five dollars.

00:37.205 --> 00:38.639
Even at school,
I was determined

00:38.672 --> 00:40.408
to take on a new attitude.

00:40.441 --> 00:41.809
Welcome back,
Boom Boom.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.311
I guess your dreams
weren't your ticket out.

00:43.344 --> 00:44.412
GREG:
Chris!

00:44.445 --> 00:47.415
A lot of bad things happened
to me at Corleone,

00:47.448 --> 00:49.817
but the one good thing
was becoming friends with Greg.

00:49.850 --> 00:51.285
Hey, man, what you been up to?

00:51.319 --> 00:52.653
Same old, same old.

00:52.686 --> 00:54.622
Feels like last year
all over again.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.324
I'm tired of being
pushed around.

00:56.357 --> 00:57.758
I'm tired of people
making fun of me.

00:57.791 --> 01:00.294
I'm tired of getting
my butt kicked.

01:00.328 --> 01:02.430
I'm not gonna
take it anymore.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.732
Wow. Are you a Muslim now?

01:04.765 --> 01:06.334
No.

01:06.367 --> 01:08.269
What are you gonna do?

01:08.302 --> 01:10.238
I'm gonna run
for class president.

01:10.271 --> 01:11.505
Dude, you're not serious.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.275
Why not?
What have I got to lose?

01:14.308 --> 01:16.210
And this isn't just for me.

01:16.244 --> 01:17.378
This is for us.

01:17.411 --> 01:20.214
How are we ever going
to get any respect?

01:20.248 --> 01:22.416
Get popular?
Get a girl?

01:22.450 --> 01:23.417
Stop getting beat down?

01:23.451 --> 01:25.319
How are we ever gonna get
treated any better

01:25.353 --> 01:26.420
if we don't act like
we deserve it?

01:26.454 --> 01:30.224
Besides, give me one good
reason why I shouldn't run.

01:36.530 --> 01:37.898
Give me one more reason.

01:37.931 --> 01:45.906

PARAMOUNT TELEVISION

01:45.939 --> 01:48.342
* Oh... make it funky now!

02:14.302 --> 02:15.469
So you're really gonna do this?

02:15.503 --> 02:17.271
Yep. All I need to do

02:17.305 --> 02:19.473
is get 30 names on this
petition and I'm in.

02:19.507 --> 02:20.941
I just want to get started

02:20.974 --> 02:22.643
before everyone gets tired
of people asking them.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.782
Okay, if you're in,
I'm with you.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.518
Good, I need you
to do something.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.486
What?
Anything.

02:32.520 --> 02:34.388
I want you to run with me.

02:34.422 --> 02:35.856
I want you to be
my vice president.

02:35.889 --> 02:37.358
No.
Yeah.

02:37.391 --> 02:38.526
Oh, man.

02:38.559 --> 02:39.793
This is great.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.529
I can work behind
the scenes.

02:41.562 --> 02:44.265
I can influence
the judiciary committee.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.799
I can confer with
the joint chiefs.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.468
Create policy!
Greg...

02:47.501 --> 02:48.669
it's the eighth grade.

02:48.702 --> 02:49.970
I know, but this
is the best thing

02:50.003 --> 02:50.871
that's ever happened to me.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.540
That was until
he met Seven of Nine

02:52.573 --> 02:53.574
at a Trekkie convention.

02:53.607 --> 02:54.908
The question is:

02:54.942 --> 02:56.544
Where are we going
to get 30 signatures?

02:56.577 --> 02:57.711
Simple.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.946
From guys like us.

02:58.979 --> 03:00.514
You mean geeks.

03:00.548 --> 03:01.449
Yeah.

03:01.482 --> 03:03.417
Because my father had the gout,

03:03.451 --> 03:05.553
my mother made sure he got
regular checkups

03:05.586 --> 03:07.421
to make sure nothing else
went wrong.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.756
So what did
the doctor say?

03:08.789 --> 03:09.990
Why don't you have a seat.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.759
The last time he told her
to sit down,

03:11.792 --> 03:13.427
it was when Jody Watley
left Shalamar.

03:13.461 --> 03:15.796
Jody Watley didn't leave
Shalamar again, did she?

03:15.829 --> 03:16.964
Nothing like that.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.501
You know, my gout's
been acting up again,

03:20.534 --> 03:23.704
and the doctor says
I have high blood pressure.

03:23.737 --> 03:25.373
How did you get
high blood pressure?

03:25.406 --> 03:27.241
High blood pressure,
or hypertension

03:27.275 --> 03:28.942
is a distress to
the cardiovascular system

03:28.976 --> 03:30.944
that could be caused by
a variety of factors,

03:30.978 --> 03:34.415
including obesity,
excess salt in the diet,

03:34.448 --> 03:37.551
alcohol abuse,
as well as hereditary factors.

03:39.487 --> 03:42.423
But one of the main causes
of hypertension is stress--

03:42.456 --> 03:45.959
like trying to support
a family of five

03:45.993 --> 03:47.495
on a budget for three.

03:47.528 --> 03:49.663
So what is he trying to say,

03:49.697 --> 03:51.565
that your family
is killing you?

03:51.599 --> 03:52.566
Yes.

03:52.600 --> 03:53.867
No. No. Um...

03:53.901 --> 03:55.836
He just said I need
to reduce my stress.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.572
Baby, what do you have
to be stressed out about?

03:58.606 --> 04:00.374
You have a beautiful wife,

04:00.408 --> 04:02.410
two good jobs,

04:02.443 --> 04:04.712
and three wonderful kids,
a nice home

04:04.745 --> 04:06.414
in Bed-Stuy...

04:07.581 --> 04:08.849
You're stressed?

04:08.882 --> 04:10.684
I mean, I'm the one
who should be stressed.

04:10.718 --> 04:12.553
I mean, I got to deal
with a house

04:12.586 --> 04:14.888
in the ghetto, three crazy kids,
a man that's

04:14.922 --> 04:16.290
never home,
and now I got to deal

04:16.324 --> 04:17.891
with you and this
high blood pressure.

04:17.925 --> 04:19.993
:
You-You're stressed.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.395
Calm down.

04:21.429 --> 04:22.730
I'll be okay.

04:22.763 --> 04:23.731
I'm fine.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.599
My father hated seeming weak.

04:25.633 --> 04:27.601
He wouldn't admit to a headache

04:27.635 --> 04:28.902
if he had a hatchet
in his head.

04:28.936 --> 04:30.638
Julius, you are
not fine, okay?

04:30.671 --> 04:31.305
You're sick.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.673
No, you're not.
I'm fine.

04:32.706 --> 04:33.807
I'm good.
You're sick.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.042
No, you're not.

04:35.075 --> 04:36.410
No, you're
trying to die.
I'm okay.

04:36.444 --> 04:37.578
I'm good, okay?
Everything.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.413
Good.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.582
Okay, Mr. I'm Good...

04:41.615 --> 04:44.985
well, what are we supposed
to do to reduce your stress?

04:45.018 --> 04:48.556
Well, the doctor says
I'm supposed to participate

04:48.589 --> 04:50.458
in some stress-reducing
activities,

04:50.491 --> 04:52.626
like golf.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.328
Golfing.
Where are you going to golf?

04:54.362 --> 04:56.664
Fishing?
Where you gonna fish,
in Lake Brooklyn?

04:56.697 --> 04:58.466
Hiking?

04:58.499 --> 05:00.968
Come on, man,
where you going,
Mount Vernon?

05:01.001 --> 05:02.570
Hammocking?
Hammock?

05:02.603 --> 05:03.537
Where are you going to buy
a hammock?

05:03.571 --> 05:04.438
Regular massages?

05:04.472 --> 05:07.575
Oh, you ain't getting
a massage by nobody.

05:07.608 --> 05:09.977
You better price some hammocks.

05:10.010 --> 05:11.111
Stressed.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.312
:
Now I got to deal with this...

05:12.346 --> 05:14.782
( "Caribbean Queen"
by Billy Ocean plays )

05:14.815 --> 05:18.652
In 1984, Michael Jackson became
the biggest star on Earth,

05:18.686 --> 05:20.020
but to my sister Tonya,

05:20.053 --> 05:22.756
he couldn't hold a candle
to Billy Ocean.

05:22.790 --> 05:25.559
* She's simply awesome

05:25.593 --> 05:26.527
What are you doing?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.596
I'm learning the steps
from "Caribbean Queen."

05:28.629 --> 05:30.531
There are no steps
to "Caribbean Queen."

05:30.564 --> 05:31.532
Yes, there are.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.635
First he does like this,
then he does like this,

05:34.668 --> 05:37.070
then he does like this,
and then he does this,

05:37.104 --> 05:39.407
and he finishes off
with this.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.207
He also does the moonwalk,

05:40.240 --> 05:41.742
but I don't know how
to do that yet.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.611
Billy Ocean doesn't moonwalk.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.678
That's Michael Jackson's move.

05:44.712 --> 05:46.580
Where do you think
Michael got it from?

05:46.614 --> 05:48.015
Peg Leg Bates.
I know how to moonwalk.

05:48.048 --> 05:49.650
Will you show me
how to do it?

05:49.683 --> 05:51.018
First, let me see
what you're doing.

05:53.153 --> 05:54.555
:
That's not the moonwalk.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.390
You look like
you're trying to scrape

05:56.424 --> 05:57.725
doo-doo
off your shoes.

05:57.758 --> 05:59.727
Shut up! Nobody asked you!
Get out!

06:00.761 --> 06:02.930
Getting my campaign going
was hard.

06:02.963 --> 06:05.599
It's not like my daddy was
the class president before me.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.401
Man, only eight
signatures?

06:07.435 --> 06:08.536
I thought
at least the nerds

06:08.569 --> 06:09.703
would support us.

06:09.737 --> 06:12.573
Even they go for
the cool people.

06:12.606 --> 06:14.742
Look at this.
Ms. Marello gave it to me.

06:14.775 --> 06:16.644
What?
It's a popularity poll.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.145
They took
a popularity poll?

06:18.178 --> 06:19.413
And focus groups.

06:19.447 --> 06:22.716
Basically, it says we can't get
on the ballot running together.

06:22.750 --> 06:23.817
What are you
talking about?

06:23.851 --> 06:25.653
We appeal
to the same base.

06:25.686 --> 06:28.756
Carol, Warren,
Terrence Ping.

06:28.789 --> 06:29.857
But we can't
let this stop us.

06:29.890 --> 06:30.824
We have to keep trying.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.860
What are we supposed to do,
just get popular?

06:32.893 --> 06:35.996
Look at him.
He's popular.

06:36.029 --> 06:37.531
DiPaolo?

06:37.565 --> 06:39.767
He's as dumb
as a rock.

06:39.800 --> 06:40.734
Hey, Chris!

06:40.768 --> 06:42.135
How do you spell "spell"?

06:42.169 --> 06:44.638
S-P-E-L-L.

06:44.672 --> 06:46.707
He might be dumb,
but people like him.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.110
They said the same thing
about Fabio.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.579
Chris...

06:51.612 --> 06:53.447
can I speak to you
for a moment?

06:53.481 --> 06:54.448
Sure.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.516
About what?

06:55.549 --> 06:56.650
I know you're having
a tough time

06:56.684 --> 06:57.885
getting on that ballot,

06:57.918 --> 07:00.220
but I think you
have a real chance

07:00.253 --> 07:01.922
at becoming
class president

07:01.955 --> 07:03.991
if you really want it.
What do you mean?

07:04.024 --> 07:06.660
You need to rise above
your ghetto mentality.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.829
Ghetto mentality?
I don't have a ghetto mentality.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.764
You do, Chris.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.533
A psychological ghetto.

07:12.566 --> 07:13.601
You won't get
supporters

07:13.634 --> 07:15.803
because you don't get out
of your comfort zone.

07:15.836 --> 07:18.005
I'm sure all
your athlete

07:18.038 --> 07:20.841
and dancer friends
have signed on, but what now?

07:20.874 --> 07:23.176
You need to reach out,
broaden your appeal.

07:23.210 --> 07:25.145
And how am I supposed
to do that?

07:25.178 --> 07:26.847
I don't know.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.617
But I'm confident
you'll figure it out.

07:29.650 --> 07:30.851
And remember, Chris:

07:30.884 --> 07:33.821
Up with hope,
down with dope.

07:33.854 --> 07:36.590
Yes, that's one bedroom
at $425 a month.

07:36.624 --> 07:38.592
Rochelle with two "L"s.

07:38.626 --> 07:39.627
All right, thank you.

07:41.529 --> 07:42.696
Where are you going?

07:42.730 --> 07:45.198
The biggest change for
my mother was that she decided

07:45.232 --> 07:48.502
to do something she hadn't done
in years-- keep a job.

07:48.536 --> 07:49.737
Normally, she would do this.

07:50.838 --> 07:52.172
Come on! Let's go!

07:52.205 --> 07:53.841
Move this ugly car out the way!

07:53.874 --> 07:55.776
Hey...!

07:55.809 --> 07:57.144
What in the hell are you doing?!

07:57.177 --> 07:59.079
I don't need this mess!

07:59.112 --> 08:01.849
My man has two jobs!
Two!

08:01.882 --> 08:03.617
Now she was doing this.

08:03.651 --> 08:04.852
And who was that
on the phone?

08:04.885 --> 08:06.186
The newspaper.

08:06.219 --> 08:08.556
I took out an ad
for a new tenant.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.891
A new tenant?
Rochelle...
Mm-hmm.

08:10.924 --> 08:13.794
We had tried renting out
the apartment upstairs before,

08:13.827 --> 08:16.129
but every time we did,
we had a problem.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.865
One lady had a crazy dog.

08:17.898 --> 08:19.633
No, no! No, no!

08:19.667 --> 08:20.901
Ms. Parnell! No!

08:20.934 --> 08:22.302
No! No, n-n-n-n-no!

08:22.335 --> 08:23.737
:
Aah...!

08:23.771 --> 08:26.840
Then we had Levi the weed guy.

08:26.874 --> 08:27.941
Levi!

08:30.243 --> 08:31.545
What

08:31.579 --> 08:32.746
You got to leave.

08:32.780 --> 08:33.747
What's wrong, man?

08:33.781 --> 08:34.815
My kids are high.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.150
The Fong family tried
to turn the apartment

08:37.184 --> 08:38.652
into a Chinese restaurant.

08:38.686 --> 08:40.721
Mr. Fong!

08:40.754 --> 08:42.089
Mr. Fong, what is this?!

08:43.924 --> 08:45.626
Man, I'm not getting
to the back of the line.

08:45.659 --> 08:46.827
Man, you got to
shut this down

08:46.860 --> 08:47.795
and get the hell
out of here.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.096
And give me a number six.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.864
Number six.
Ooh, very good.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.634
What you getting?

08:53.667 --> 08:55.769
Wait, wait, wait, look.
You don't have to do this.

08:55.803 --> 08:57.571
I'll be okay.
I mean...

08:57.605 --> 08:58.672
All I need to do...

08:58.706 --> 09:00.941
Baby, just let me do
what I got to do.

09:00.974 --> 09:02.209
Rochelle...

09:02.242 --> 09:03.977
Now just go lay down.

09:04.011 --> 09:05.045
Go.

09:07.014 --> 09:08.616
Lay down!

09:10.984 --> 09:13.621
After another checkup,
my father was trying to get

09:13.654 --> 09:15.355
my mother to let up,
but the pressure was on.

09:15.388 --> 09:16.824
Chris, pass the salt.

09:17.958 --> 09:20.794
What, are you trying
to kill yourself?

09:24.698 --> 09:26.233
Where's the skin?

09:26.266 --> 09:27.768
Baby, I had
to take it off.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.036
You just gonna give me
naked chicken?

09:29.069 --> 09:30.904
How you supposed
to be reducing

09:30.938 --> 09:31.705
my stress, by starving me?

09:31.739 --> 09:33.641
Now I'm worried
about being hungry.

09:33.674 --> 09:35.709
You're worried about everybody
else stressing me out;

09:35.743 --> 09:36.810
you're stressing me out.

09:36.844 --> 09:37.945
What?

09:38.879 --> 09:40.247
I'm stressing you out?

09:41.281 --> 09:42.282
I'm bending
over backwards

09:42.315 --> 09:43.817
trying to make things
easy for you

09:43.851 --> 09:45.018
and I'm stressing you out.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.286
Okay.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.788
Fine.

09:47.821 --> 09:50.958
That face means
"What did I say that for?"

09:50.991 --> 09:52.392
You know what?

09:52.425 --> 09:54.662
You can eat what
you want to eat,

09:54.695 --> 09:56.029
do what you want to do.

09:56.063 --> 09:57.330
You don't have
to worry about me

09:57.364 --> 09:59.767
stressing you out anymore.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.307
You gonna eat that skin?

10:09.342 --> 10:11.144
After what Ms. Morello
had told me,

10:11.178 --> 10:14.347
I knew there was only one way
I was gonna broaden my appeal.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.083
I've been thinking
about the popularity poll.

10:16.116 --> 10:18.385
Take a look at this.
I've got it all worked out.

10:20.220 --> 10:21.855
So do I.

10:21.889 --> 10:23.390
You're off the ticket.

10:27.027 --> 10:30.063
Go to commercial
before both of us start crying.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.837
CHRIS ROCK:
I hated having to sacrifice
my friendship with Greg

10:36.870 --> 10:39.106
to get on the ballot,
but I knew it would only happen

10:39.139 --> 10:41.241
if I could get the most popular
person I could find.

10:41.274 --> 10:42.409
Vice president?

10:42.442 --> 10:43.543
Yeah. With me.

10:43.576 --> 10:46.013
We can be like Bobby Jones
and Henry Bibby on the Sixers.

10:46.046 --> 10:47.981
Can we be like
Kevin McHale

10:48.015 --> 10:49.883
and Dennis Johnson
on the Celtics?

10:49.917 --> 10:50.951
Okay.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.853
What do I have to do?
Nothing.

10:52.886 --> 10:55.022
Cool.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.724
JULIUS:
Hey, everybody.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.325
I'm... home.

10:58.358 --> 11:00.427
Back at home,
my father never had it harder

11:00.460 --> 11:03.230
than when my mother
let him take it easy.

11:03.263 --> 11:04.798
Hey, baby.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.400
What's going on?

11:07.434 --> 11:08.769
Nothing.

11:08.802 --> 11:10.070
Nothing at all.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.005
There is nothing going on
in this house.

11:12.039 --> 11:14.374
When my mother said
nothing was going on,

11:14.407 --> 11:16.376
here's what it meant
to my father:

11:22.382 --> 11:24.117
You didn't make me
something to eat?

11:24.151 --> 11:26.053
No, I didn't want
to stress you out.

11:26.086 --> 11:27.955
You good? Good.

11:29.456 --> 11:31.892
I still got to eat.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.227
After trying to moonwalk
like Billy Ocean,

11:34.261 --> 11:37.965
Tonya was moving one step
forward and two steps back.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.399
:
Drew.

11:39.432 --> 11:40.801
What?

11:40.834 --> 11:42.469
Can you teach me to moonwalk?

11:42.502 --> 11:43.971
I can't get it.

11:44.004 --> 11:47.074
Why do you like Billy Ocean
so much, anyway?

11:47.107 --> 11:49.977
Because, he's the greatest
entertainer in history.

11:50.010 --> 11:51.779
He's not better
than Michael Jackson.

11:51.812 --> 11:53.881
Shoot, he's way better
than Michael Jackson.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.016
I bet you in the future,
20 years from now,

11:56.049 --> 11:58.118
nobody's going to remember
who Michael Jackson is.

11:58.151 --> 11:59.319
That's why I'm not going
to teach you

11:59.352 --> 12:01.221
how to do
the Michael Jackson moonwalk.

12:01.254 --> 12:03.090
It's the Billy Ocean moonwalk.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.391
Michael Jackson stole it.

12:04.424 --> 12:06.526
Fine. Have it your way.

12:06.559 --> 12:07.861
Drew, wait.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.031
Can you help me, please?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.833
:
I was just joking.

12:12.866 --> 12:14.968
Play the tape.

12:15.002 --> 12:17.504
Drew was always good
at pretty much everything.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.940
We're just glad
he never liked Riverdance.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.409
* Whoo!

12:22.442 --> 12:24.011
* Ah.

12:24.044 --> 12:26.179
* She dashed by me
in painted-on jeans *

12:26.213 --> 12:28.248
Then after you turn...
do this.

12:28.281 --> 12:30.083
See?

12:32.052 --> 12:33.854
* And all heads turned

12:33.887 --> 12:36.356
Cool. That's right.
*'Cause she was the dream

12:36.389 --> 12:38.558
That's not right yet.

12:38.591 --> 12:40.961
Your left foot.

12:40.994 --> 12:43.030
*In the blink of an eye
Now one more thing.

12:43.063 --> 12:45.899
* I knew her number
and her name *

12:45.933 --> 12:47.034
Move your hand
like this.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.035
* Yeah

12:48.068 --> 12:49.136
* Ow!

12:49.169 --> 12:53.373
* She said I was the tiger
she wanted to tame *

12:53.406 --> 12:55.508
Like this?
Almost.

12:55.542 --> 12:57.410
It's like this.
See?

12:57.444 --> 12:58.812
*Caribbean queen
Good.

12:58.846 --> 12:59.880
* Now we're sharing...

13:01.014 --> 13:03.283
I was surprised how well things
were going for me,

13:03.316 --> 13:05.485
but that wasn't
the only surprise I got.

13:05.518 --> 13:09.189
Also securing their position
as candidates

13:09.222 --> 13:13.126
are Joey Caruso and his new
vice presidential running mate,

13:13.160 --> 13:13.927
Greg Wuliger.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.966
What's the matter,
McAdoo.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.100
Thought you were
the only one

13:20.133 --> 13:21.835
who knew how to balance
a ticket?

13:24.872 --> 13:27.207
At school, the heat was on,
but at home,

13:27.240 --> 13:29.209
my dad was still getting
the cold shoulder.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.311
Mama,
are you mad at Daddy?

13:31.344 --> 13:33.346
My parents tried to never fight
in front of us,

13:33.380 --> 13:35.382
but we always knew
what was going on.

13:35.415 --> 13:36.549
No.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.185
So how come we didn't
wait for him to eat?

13:38.218 --> 13:40.520
Because you should eat your food

13:40.553 --> 13:43.056
and mind your business,
that's why.

13:43.090 --> 13:44.157
CHRIS:
Ma.

13:44.191 --> 13:45.926
These vegetables
taste funny.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.060
DREW:
Yeah, and why are they

13:47.094 --> 13:48.295
so hard?

13:48.328 --> 13:50.463
Yeah, and why are
they so green?

13:50.497 --> 13:51.865
That's because they're fresh.

13:51.899 --> 13:54.467
You know, they're
not out of a can. Eat.

13:54.501 --> 13:57.004
I like canned
vegetables better.

13:57.037 --> 13:59.372
Almost everything we ate
came out of cans.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.409
Bacon and eggs.

14:02.442 --> 14:04.912
Hamburger and fries.

14:04.945 --> 14:10.550
We even had ice cream
and birthday cake in a can.

14:12.452 --> 14:14.221
Hey, Dad.
Hey, Dad.

14:14.254 --> 14:15.923
Hey. All right.

14:18.525 --> 14:21.929
Let's see.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.965
Whoo.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.199
All right.

14:26.233 --> 14:28.068
Now this
is what I'm talking about.

14:28.101 --> 14:29.469
He's talking
about a heart attack.

14:29.502 --> 14:30.670
Thank you, baby.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.072
Pork chops, steak,
fried chicken,

14:32.105 --> 14:34.007
gravy,
mac and cheese--

14:34.041 --> 14:35.408
this is how to relax.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.977
Mmm.

14:38.011 --> 14:41.448
Mmm! Mmm.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.456
What's that for?

14:49.489 --> 14:53.126
If you feel like you're
about to keel over and die,

14:53.160 --> 14:55.428
you can call the
hospital for help,

14:55.462 --> 14:57.430
'cause I don't want
to stress you out.

15:00.633 --> 15:03.937
Enjoy.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.709
* Got to give the people

15:09.742 --> 15:11.544
* Now

15:11.578 --> 15:13.947
* Give the people
what they want *

15:13.981 --> 15:16.316
* Well, well... well, well

15:16.349 --> 15:21.321
* Don't you know
you got to give the people *

15:21.354 --> 15:24.157
* Give the people
what they want *

15:26.559 --> 15:31.331
* Well, I done been
all over the world *

15:31.364 --> 15:35.068
* And everybody feels the same

15:35.102 --> 15:38.138
* It's a unanimous decision...

15:38.171 --> 15:41.174
The only thing I hated more
than running against Greg

15:41.208 --> 15:43.076
was seeing him run with Caruso.

15:43.110 --> 15:43.977
I had kicked him off my team,

15:44.011 --> 15:45.745
and now I had to play
against him.

15:45.778 --> 15:48.148
Kind of like Shaq and Kobe.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.316
* Give it up

15:49.349 --> 15:51.418
* Give the people
what they want. *

15:54.654 --> 15:56.223
ROCHELLE:
No!
CHRIS ROCK:
My father found out

15:56.256 --> 15:57.457
the only thing harder

15:57.490 --> 16:00.193
than dealing with my mother
was being left alone.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.228
Who's that?

16:01.261 --> 16:04.197
Vanessa.
Hey, Vanessa.

16:04.231 --> 16:06.333
Julius said, "Hey."
Hey.

16:06.366 --> 16:07.700
Uh-huh.

16:07.734 --> 16:09.336
Have you seen
my other uniform?

16:09.369 --> 16:11.171
I didn't mess with it;
I didn't want to stress you out.

16:11.204 --> 16:12.739
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

16:13.873 --> 16:17.177
No. No, no, you wanted me
to say it, now, didn't you?

16:17.210 --> 16:18.611
What's all this?

16:18.645 --> 16:20.047
That's your stuff.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.148
You did?

16:21.181 --> 16:23.350
My father never knew
when he was starting a war

16:23.383 --> 16:26.219
with my mother, and that's why
he never won them.
Yes!

16:26.253 --> 16:28.355
Yes, girl,
you know...
Rochelle?

16:28.388 --> 16:32.225
Let me call you back.

16:32.259 --> 16:34.227
What?

16:34.261 --> 16:36.196
Stop it. Okay?

16:36.229 --> 16:37.297
I got high blood pressure.

16:37.330 --> 16:38.531
What do you want me to do?

16:38.565 --> 16:41.101
I don't know, Julius;
what do you want me to do?

16:41.134 --> 16:43.370
I don't know, but
you running around
not talking to me

16:43.403 --> 16:44.471
and making me
wear dirty clothes

16:44.504 --> 16:45.672
and letting me eat
by myself

16:45.705 --> 16:47.807
ain't helping a thing.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.309
I don't need you
to be mad at me.

16:49.342 --> 16:53.280
I was just trying
to help you out.

16:53.313 --> 16:55.215
I know.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.449
I'm sorry.

16:56.483 --> 16:59.419
Look, from now on,
I'll try to relax.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.054
I'll try to eat better.

17:01.088 --> 17:03.256
Julius, if you are
not in this house,

17:03.290 --> 17:04.591
this place will fall apart.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.326
And then,
the next thing you know,

17:06.359 --> 17:08.228
our kids will wind up
in the streets.

17:08.261 --> 17:09.429
Drew may wind up in jail,

17:09.462 --> 17:12.332
then I'm going to lose my job
going to his court cases.

17:12.365 --> 17:13.133
And you know
I'm going to do

17:13.166 --> 17:15.268
what I have to do
to make ends meet.

17:15.302 --> 17:17.837
And if you think I'm going
to jail for welfare fraud,

17:17.870 --> 17:19.072
you got another thing coming.

17:19.106 --> 17:22.175
So, yes, Julius, we really,
really need to think about this.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.344
We need to know
what we got to do.

17:24.377 --> 17:27.280
We'll do what we always do:
deal with it.

17:28.315 --> 17:30.417
I love you.

17:30.450 --> 17:32.785
We'll make it work.
My father never did change
his diet.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.521
He didn't do yoga,

17:34.554 --> 17:37.290
never took up golfing,
didn't even get a hammock.

17:37.324 --> 17:39.226
What he did was find one
of the cheapest,

17:39.259 --> 17:41.261
medically approved ways
of reducing stress:

17:41.294 --> 17:42.629
earplugs.

17:42.662 --> 17:48.201
*Happy feelings in the air...

17:48.235 --> 17:50.470
I love you so much, baby.

17:50.503 --> 17:52.205
Can I get that
massage, now?

17:52.239 --> 17:53.540
You want a six-iron
upside your head?

17:55.208 --> 17:57.210
( Billy Ocean's
"Caribbean Queen" playing )

17:57.244 --> 17:58.845
Yes!

17:58.878 --> 18:00.647
What

18:00.680 --> 18:02.582
I did it, I got it!
What?

18:02.615 --> 18:05.118
I can dance like Billy Ocean--
I can do the moonwalk.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.386
Billy Ocean?

18:06.419 --> 18:07.754
I thought Michael Jackson
did the moonwalk.

18:07.787 --> 18:09.889
Michael Jackson stole it.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.292
Uh-oh. Uh-oh!

18:12.325 --> 18:13.460
Look at her.

18:13.493 --> 18:14.761
Whoo!

18:14.794 --> 18:16.363
* She dashed by me

18:16.396 --> 18:18.465
*In painted-on jeans...
It's Hammer time.

18:18.498 --> 18:20.433
JULIUS:
Yeah, that's my girl.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.602
The hardest thing
about winning at any cost

18:22.635 --> 18:25.438
is that sometimes
that price gets way too high.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.374
I was already paying
that price,

18:27.407 --> 18:29.242
but I didn't know
that Greg was, too.

18:29.276 --> 18:30.910
Hey.
Hey.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.412
What happened?

18:32.445 --> 18:34.147
You don't want to know.

18:34.181 --> 18:35.682
If I was going to get
my friend back,

18:35.715 --> 18:38.418
I knew I had to get
out of my comfort zone

18:38.451 --> 18:39.552
and do something bold.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.620
I'm sorry.

18:40.653 --> 18:42.655
About what?

18:42.689 --> 18:44.557
About everything.

18:44.591 --> 18:46.426
I just wanted things
to be different.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.628
Sometimes, I think you
don't know how it is for me.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.497
You might think I'm different,

18:50.530 --> 18:54.601
but I'm not, not really.

19:00.507 --> 19:01.774
I don't get this.

19:01.808 --> 19:04.844
Caruso tore them down.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.446
And when everyone got here
tomorrow,

19:06.479 --> 19:09.449
they were going to blame you
and ruin your campaign.

19:09.482 --> 19:12.685
I wouldn't help, so Caruso
kicked me off his ticket.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.722
Hey.

19:15.755 --> 19:17.557
It's okay, leave them.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.891
Not going to make
any difference.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.393
What do you mean?

19:20.427 --> 19:22.395
I'm going to drop out.

19:22.429 --> 19:23.796
I didn't know
it would be like this.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.465
I didn't know
it would be this hard.

19:25.498 --> 19:28.368
I didn't want to win
an election and lose a friend.

19:28.401 --> 19:29.902
No, you have
to stay in.

19:29.936 --> 19:32.272
What for?
"What for?"

19:32.305 --> 19:33.940
Because you're not just
doing this for yourself,

19:33.973 --> 19:35.642
you're doing it for us.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.976
You said it yourself.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.445
You're tired of us
being pushed around.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.913
You're tired of people
always making fun of us.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.250
Remember? You're not
going to take it anymore.

19:43.283 --> 19:44.317
That's what you said.

19:44.351 --> 19:47.287
Later that year,
Oprah ran into Greg at Kmart.

19:47.320 --> 19:49.989
He gave her the same speech,
and the rest is history.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.460
I don't want to run without you,
and together, we can't win.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.627
Who cares?

19:54.661 --> 19:55.728
Run with DiPaolo.

19:55.762 --> 19:57.497
Let me be your
campaign manager.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.898
Campaign manager?

19:58.931 --> 20:00.700
Yeah. We can do this.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.802
I'll manipulate
the press corps.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.372
I'll contact the
foreign media outlets.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.740
Greg? It's the eighth grade.

20:09.776 --> 20:11.010
So are you in?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.579
Let's do this.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.617
Taking charge wasn't as easy
as it sounded,

20:17.650 --> 20:19.586
but I was going to run
for president,

20:19.619 --> 20:22.589
and if nothing else,
I finally had some dignity.

20:22.622 --> 20:24.491
* Everybody hates Chris.
