No, and I intend
to keep it that way.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.057

And perhaps today,
we're going to learn

07:41.094 --> 07:42.994
their true identity.

07:46.566 --> 07:50.135
A traitor in our ranks
is feeding the rebels
information.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.905
That is the only logical
explanation for their success.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.574

unmasked quickly,

08:18.031 --> 08:22.601
as I'm on the verge
of locating the rebel base
in this sector.

08:25.137 --> 08:27.873
I've narrowed it down
to these worlds.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.714
their attacks on
Imperial ships and facilities,

08:35.716 --> 08:39.117
and rather importantly,
proximity to Lothal.

08:40.953 --> 08:41.853
You're dismissed.

08:46.659 --> 08:48.560
Agent Kallus, you've had
multiple encounters

08:48.562 --> 08:51.162
with the rebels
in this sector.

08:51.164 --> 08:52.797
Any thoughts
on our traitor?

08:52.799 --> 08:54.633
A high-level
intelligence leak

08:54.635 --> 08:56.034
suggests an officer.

08:56.036 --> 08:58.904
True, but in our
technological system,

08:58.906 --> 09:02.073
accessing information
tends to be easier

09:02.075 --> 09:03.575
than having the means
to transmit it

09:03.577 --> 09:05.844
without
the Empire's knowledge.

09:05.846 --> 09:08.146
Perhaps the
communication division?

09:08.148 --> 09:09.147
Too obvious.

09:09.149 --> 09:12.150
Whoever this spy is,

09:12.152 --> 09:14.185
they have a method
of transmitting

09:14.187 --> 09:15.720
that we are,
as yet, unaware of.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.256
If I can do anything
to help...

I'll let you know.

escapes the eye

Kallus.

09:34.041 --> 09:38.243
I saw a report that
a shuttle theft from Lothal
was prevented.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.779
Actually, Lieutenant Lyste
was responsible for that.

09:41.113 --> 09:43.048
Really?

09:43.050 --> 09:45.083
Well, that deserves
commendation.

09:45.685 --> 09:47.719
Thank you, Governor.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.721
Step carefully.

09:49.723 --> 09:51.556
ISB is watching her.

09:51.558 --> 09:53.091
You should, too.

09:54.026 --> 09:55.760
What? Why?

09:55.762 --> 09:58.964
You don't mean Pryce
is the rebel spy?

09:58.966 --> 10:01.099
That's why she wasn't
in the meeting!

10:01.101 --> 10:04.202
Thrawn has no proof yet,
but I'm sure he'd be grateful

10:04.204 --> 10:06.137
if you kept an eye on her.

10:06.706 --> 10:09.140
He can count on me.

10:16.115 --> 10:17.616
Any progress?

10:17.618 --> 10:19.918
I'm certain
the spy was present

10:19.920 --> 10:21.553
at our interviews.

10:21.555 --> 10:24.222
Now, to see
if they take our bait
and warn the rebels.

10:24.224 --> 10:26.224
I may have something.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.960
A coded rebel message
was beamed from this ship

10:28.962 --> 10:31.329
right after
an off-ship prisoner
was transferred

10:31.331 --> 10:33.999
to your
detention block, B-7.

10:34.001 --> 10:35.567
Well, then...

10:35.569 --> 10:37.736
Shall we visit this
mysterious prisoner?

10:39.839 --> 10:43.842
No, we should get the codes
before we release Bridger.

Now let's
get out of here.

11:03.630 --> 11:04.829
None of us
will be leaving

And I'm afraid
there's another complication.

11:12.205 --> 11:15.006
I've just learned
that Thrawn is very close

11:15.008 --> 11:16.007
to locating your base.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.677
You have to tell me
where it is.

11:18.679 --> 11:21.212
So you can tell him?
No way!

11:21.214 --> 11:23.014
You'll find out
when we get there.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.617
Not if Thrawn
destroys it first.

11:25.619 --> 11:27.852
I need to know its location
so I can remove it

11:27.854 --> 11:29.020

our base hidden

11:39.966 --> 11:41.366
and we can gain
the clearance codes

we so desperately need.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.136
Okay, we'll do it.

13:26.907 --> 13:30.308
Fine. Chop, transmit
the codes to Kanan.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.609
Are you crazy?

13:31.611 --> 13:32.777
They'll intercept
the transmission!

13:32.779 --> 13:35.246
Yeah, that a secret code
was transmitted

13:35.248 --> 13:36.848
from Thrawn's office.

13:36.850 --> 13:37.749
Good point.

13:40.686 --> 13:42.153
Chop, what's going on?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.188
(CHOPPER GRUNTING)

13:43.190 --> 13:44.656
The codes are
coming through now.

13:44.658 --> 13:45.790
Good job, Chopper.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.559
Tell them to get
to the hangar. Hurry!

13:50.196 --> 13:51.429
You were right.

13:51.431 --> 13:52.764
Thrawn is close
to finding our base.

13:52.766 --> 13:57.468
Droid, erase that planet
and add another as a decoy.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.204
(GRUNTING)

14:01.874 --> 14:03.174
AP-5: (OVER COMMS)
<i>Unfortunate news.</i>

14:03.176 --> 14:07.011
<i>Grand Admiral Thrawn</i>
<i>is headed for his office.</i>

14:07.013 --> 14:09.047
What?
Try to stall him!

14:09.049 --> 14:10.682
<i>Oh, wait, I can't.</i>

14:10.684 --> 14:13.384
<i>He's at the door.</i>
I'll handle it.

14:17.056 --> 14:19.691
Lieutenant Lyste
is inside, sir.

14:19.693 --> 14:21.159
Ready your weapon
and follow me.

14:21.161 --> 14:22.794
(BEEPING)

14:23.796 --> 14:25.563
Chopper, shut off
the holo map.

14:25.565 --> 14:26.297
Come on!
Kallus, let's...

14:26.299 --> 14:28.366
Where'd he go?

14:28.368 --> 14:29.968
Hide!

15:13.545 --> 15:15.079
Is everything
all right, sir?

15:15.881 --> 15:16.781
Apparently so.
Yes.

15:23.455 --> 15:24.622
(GRUNTING)

15:24.624 --> 15:26.291
Override code, Rukh.

15:32.097 --> 15:33.965
(LASERS BLASTING)

15:50.616 --> 15:51.716
Come on,
while he's distracted.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.625
Lyste!

16:00.627 --> 16:02.927
Assassin droids?
You're welcome.

16:02.929 --> 16:03.828
Nice work.

16:06.498 --> 16:09.167
Come on,
we're getting out of here.

16:28.187 --> 16:31.489
Colonel,
listen to me carefully...

16:33.292 --> 16:35.994
Well, here goes nothing.

16:40.632 --> 16:41.666
Whoa.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.668
Hey, gramps,
you want to fill me in?

16:43.670 --> 16:45.269
Lot of ships.

16:45.271 --> 16:47.672
How many?
Don't worry about it.

16:47.674 --> 16:49.374
Just transmit the codes.
Fast.

16:50.676 --> 16:54.545
Shuttle TY992,
you are cleared to land.

16:56.115 --> 16:57.715
Get me Governor Pryce.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.528
Comfortable?

17:10.530 --> 17:12.096
I thought I lost
a little weight.

17:15.334 --> 17:18.136
There's our ride.
And there's
Governor Pryce.

17:20.339 --> 17:22.673
Troopers, stand down and
remove your helmets.

17:22.675 --> 17:26.077
I'm placing you
under arrest.

17:26.079 --> 17:27.211
There must be
some kind of mistake, sir.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.680
I'm sure we can...

17:29.682 --> 17:30.748
Shoot him.

17:30.750 --> 17:33.151
(LASERS BLASTING)

17:34.987 --> 17:36.087
I don't want to hurt you,
lady.

17:36.089 --> 17:36.921
(GRUNTS)

17:36.923 --> 17:38.990
Don't worry,
you won't.

17:38.992 --> 17:40.825
She is the traitor!

17:40.827 --> 17:42.427
Chopper, seal the doors.

17:52.671 --> 17:54.739
(GRUNTING)

17:57.076 --> 17:58.743
(SIGHS)

18:04.683 --> 18:06.084
(LASER BLASTS)
(GROANS)

18:10.122 --> 18:11.923
I've got her!
She's the traitor!

18:11.925 --> 18:14.759
Trooper, are you
all right? Trooper?

18:14.761 --> 18:16.094
Bad choice.

18:16.096 --> 18:17.595
You!

18:17.597 --> 18:18.763
You're the shuttle thief
who... (EXCLAIMS)

18:18.765 --> 18:20.965
Come on,
we've got to go.

18:25.871 --> 18:26.704
Kallus, come on.

18:26.706 --> 18:29.073
There's been
a change of plans

18:29.075 --> 18:32.677
now that I've captured
Fulcrum.

18:35.714 --> 18:36.781
I can do more good here.

18:41.653 --> 18:44.822
(LASERS BLASTING)

18:45.757 --> 18:47.158
Traitor!
You're the rebel spy!

18:47.160 --> 18:49.093
Troopers!
What?

18:49.095 --> 18:50.661
Seize him! What are
you talking about?

18:51.263 --> 18:53.731
Take him away.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.134
No. Wait!

18:56.136 --> 18:57.802
I'm not the spy,
Governor Pryce is!

18:57.804 --> 19:01.772
It seems you stopped our spy
from escaping, Agent Kallus.

19:01.774 --> 19:02.640
Tell them, Kallus!

19:02.642 --> 19:05.776
It's her!
She's the one!

19:05.778 --> 19:07.311
Kallus!

19:08.747 --> 19:12.783
Lyste's code cylinder
confirms our suspicions.

19:12.785 --> 19:14.752
He used it
to override security,

19:14.754 --> 19:15.653
release the prisoner,

19:15.655 --> 19:17.922
and contact the rebels.

19:17.924 --> 19:21.092
I have my own proof
of Lyste's treachery.

19:21.094 --> 19:24.862
Thank you for your
brave actions, Agent Kallus.

19:24.864 --> 19:25.930
Well done.

19:25.932 --> 19:28.166
Unfortunately,
not in time to stop him

19:28.168 --> 19:30.801
from an assassination attempt
on the Admiral.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.004
My apologies, sir.

19:33.006 --> 19:36.007
None required.
He did not succeed.

19:36.009 --> 19:39.710
The Empire will make a note
of your service, Agent Kallus.

19:39.712 --> 19:41.012
You may go.

19:41.880 --> 19:44.248
Thank you, Grand Admiral.

19:53.825 --> 19:56.127
Things have
fallen into place

19:56.129 --> 19:58.896
a little too perfectly
for my liking.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.032
And I don't think
Lieutenant Lyste

20:01.034 --> 20:03.000
is capable of what
you've accused him of.

20:03.002 --> 20:04.869
I agree.

20:04.871 --> 20:06.137
(DOOR OPENS)

20:06.139 --> 20:08.806
Sir, the prisoner's
effects have arrived,

20:08.808 --> 20:10.107
as you requested.

20:14.713 --> 20:15.746
Colonel Yularen,

20:15.748 --> 20:18.349
what do you
think of this design?

20:18.351 --> 20:19.750
A beast of some kind.

20:19.752 --> 20:23.054
A stylized expression
of a Loth-cat,

20:23.056 --> 20:25.756
a ubiquitous native of Lothal.

20:25.758 --> 20:29.060
And rendered by
a very familiar artist.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.929
The use of this
specific color,

20:31.931 --> 20:33.030
the angle of the line,

20:33.032 --> 20:36.834
this is the work
of the rebel
Sabine Wren.

20:36.836 --> 20:39.237
I believe this helmet
belongs to her compatriot,

20:39.239 --> 20:43.774
the young Jedi
and our escaped prisoner,
Ezra Bridger.

20:43.776 --> 20:44.775
Bridger?

20:44.777 --> 20:46.077
If Bridger was
the shuttle thief,

20:46.079 --> 20:48.112
why didn't Kallus alert us?

20:48.114 --> 20:49.680
Because, Colonel Yularen,

20:49.682 --> 20:54.185
Kallus is the rebel spy,
Fulcrum.

20:55.787 --> 20:58.889
He used Lyste's cylinder to
impersonate and implicate him.

20:58.891 --> 21:02.893
And more importantly,
he used the young Jedi's power

21:02.895 --> 21:07.131
to gain access to my office
and reprogram my droids.

21:07.133 --> 21:09.200
Very skillfully,
I might add.

21:09.202 --> 21:13.771
I would never
have suspected
one of my best students

21:13.773 --> 21:16.874
was capable of this betrayal.

21:16.876 --> 21:21.245
And that is why
you and so many others
have been deceived.

21:21.247 --> 21:24.615
I believe Agent Fulcrum
will prove far more useful

21:24.617 --> 21:27.852
to the Empire
than Kallus ever was.
