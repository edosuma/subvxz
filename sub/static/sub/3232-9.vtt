00:26.480 --> 00:28.277
These people.

00:28.840 --> 00:29.795
Pathetic.

00:31.840 --> 00:33.796
I already read that one anyway.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.877
Kleinman has better magazines.

00:36.080 --> 00:39.152
You know, you guys
really don't need to hang around.

00:39.360 --> 00:41.669
We won't even get the results
till next week.

00:41.880 --> 00:44.348
Buddy, we're gonna be here.
You kidding me?

00:44.560 --> 00:47.154
It is a full PET/CT, correct?

00:47.360 --> 00:51.273
You definitely want the PET/CT
and not just the PET.

00:51.480 --> 00:54.790
Yeah, it's a PET/CT.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.355
Good. That's what you want.

00:57.560 --> 01:00.757
Some places skimp
and they only do the PET.

01:01.480 --> 01:03.675
I'm not naming any names.

01:04.800 --> 01:07.758
I just still don't understand
why you don't go to Kleinman.

01:07.960 --> 01:09.552
This is where WaIt's doctor is.

01:09.760 --> 01:12.320
Well, with us, you wouldn't
have to wait until next week...

01:12.520 --> 01:14.192
...to get the results.

01:14.400 --> 01:17.233
I'm sorry, but these scans
are not that difficult to read.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.953
I could take one look at WaIt's...

01:19.360 --> 01:21.396
...and tell you immediately
how he's doing.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.273
-Really.
-Doctors like people to think...

01:24.480 --> 01:27.790
...that they're so much smarter
than the technicians...

01:28.000 --> 01:31.959
...but you would be surprised
how much they come to us for input.

01:35.280 --> 01:39.159
Well, never turn down a chance
to hit the bathroom, huh?

01:39.760 --> 01:41.318
Excuse me.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.918
You all right in there?

01:55.480 --> 01:56.833
Yeah.

02:00.440 --> 02:01.998
Hey, you okay?

02:02.200 --> 02:03.633
Yes.

02:05.920 --> 02:07.876
I'm fine, thank you.

02:31.160 --> 02:34.118
Sir, you can go back to your
changing room and get dressed.

02:34.320 --> 02:39.155
-So how'd we do?
-You did fine.

02:41.320 --> 02:44.278
-See anything?
-I'm just a technician, Mr. White.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.199
Dr. Delcavoli will go over the results
with you next week.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.753
Sorry.

03:25.440 --> 03:28.876
Actually, the money-laundering aspect
is fairly straightforward.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.516
But I gotta tell you,
the not-telling-your-wife aspect?

03:32.720 --> 03:35.280
Most people wanna know
why they suddenly got rich.

03:35.480 --> 03:39.268
If she finds out, it's after I'm gone.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.391
How much time they giving you?

03:42.320 --> 03:43.833
Weeks.

03:44.040 --> 03:45.553
Maybe.

03:45.760 --> 03:47.159
Sorry to hear it.

03:47.360 --> 03:50.830
I was hoping we could
make some real money together.

03:51.520 --> 03:53.715
Oh, well.
Look, let's crunch some numbers.

03:53.920 --> 03:56.514
How much money
are we laundering?

03:57.880 --> 04:00.678
At this time, $16,000.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.953
How long you been doing this?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.309
We've had some
extenuating circumstances.

04:07.520 --> 04:08.919
Yeah, apparently.

04:09.120 --> 04:14.240
All right, 16,000 laundered
at 75 cents on the dollar...

04:14.440 --> 04:17.829
...minus my fee,
which is 17 percent...

04:18.040 --> 04:21.077
...comes to $9960.

04:21.279 --> 04:24.750
Congratulations, you just left
your family a secondhand Subaru.

04:24.960 --> 04:28.350
Well, we'll just have to cook more.
A lot more.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.835
Yeah, that's my legal opinion.

04:31.040 --> 04:34.157
Make hay
while the sun is still shining.

04:40.040 --> 04:43.077
You know, we should do something
this weekend.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.431
You know,
get our minds off the test results.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.951
Actually, l....

04:53.720 --> 04:56.393
I'm thinking I should go see Mom.

05:01.440 --> 05:03.271
-Really?
-Yeah.

05:03.880 --> 05:06.758
You know, I never did call her.

05:09.120 --> 05:13.636
You're expecting the news
from the scan to be bad.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.118
God, Walt.

05:20.840 --> 05:24.037
I need you to stay positive
with me here.

05:24.240 --> 05:27.471
I am. Positive is good.

05:27.680 --> 05:28.829
I'm all for positive...

05:29.040 --> 05:33.318
...but positive doesn't change facts,
all right?

05:33.520 --> 05:34.839
It....

05:35.320 --> 05:37.788
It doesn't change the need
to be prepared.

05:38.000 --> 05:39.319
I know.

05:39.520 --> 05:42.751
Walt, I'm just trying
to be hopeful, okay?

05:42.960 --> 05:44.951
You know, forgive me.

05:47.600 --> 05:49.113
Look...

05:49.320 --> 05:52.118
...I need to know Mom's
going to leave you something if--

05:52.320 --> 05:53.833
If...

05:54.720 --> 05:55.948
...I'm no longer around.

05:57.240 --> 06:00.232
I just need to get that straight,
that's all.

06:02.960 --> 06:06.509
And believe me,
I'm gonna earn every penny of it too.

06:07.960 --> 06:11.430
Complaining about her nurses
the entire time.

06:12.160 --> 06:16.199
"Juanita is hiding my ashtray."

06:17.560 --> 06:20.757
A 30-minute discourse...

06:20.960 --> 06:24.270
...about how the sugar packets
are suddenly disappearing.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.631
And, oh, she's counting
every one of them, you know.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.871
I'll be lucky
if I get a word in edgewise.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.915
I actually think the news from the scan
is gonna be good.

06:53.480 --> 06:56.278
Perhaps you should prepare for that.

06:58.040 --> 06:59.439
Yeah.

07:07.920 --> 07:11.959
-We should do something.
-Yeah, we should.

07:12.160 --> 07:14.515
No, something else.

07:15.400 --> 07:17.391
We should go somewhere.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.271
Have you been
to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum?

07:20.480 --> 07:22.516
Is that the one with the A-bombs?

07:24.960 --> 07:27.076
Georgia O'Keeffe.

07:27.280 --> 07:29.111
She's a painter.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.591
You've never heard
of Georgia O'Keeffe?

07:31.800 --> 07:33.597
No, is that bad?

07:33.800 --> 07:38.351
-Boy, you need some educating.
-Yes, yes, I do. Come here.

07:38.560 --> 07:41.552
Why don't we go up to Santa Fe?
We'll make a day of it.

07:41.760 --> 07:45.196
You wanna go all the way to Santa Fe
for a museum?

07:45.400 --> 07:47.868
So romantic.

07:48.080 --> 07:50.640
Yup, we're going. Get up.

07:51.400 --> 07:55.473
Why can't we just go to the movies
or putt-putt?

07:55.680 --> 07:57.875
It's the shit.

07:58.280 --> 08:00.077
A little culture won't kill you.

08:00.280 --> 08:03.716
Besides, you might like it.
A lot of her paintings look like vaginas.

08:05.080 --> 08:06.115
Really?

08:09.720 --> 08:12.188
-ls there still cereal?
-Yeah.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.913
Yo, ifl know you, leave a message.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.759
Where the hell are you?
Pick up the phone.

08:24.960 --> 08:28.032
-Hello? Jesse, pick up--
-Hold on, hold on.

08:28.240 --> 08:30.196
Sorry, one sec.

08:35.159 --> 08:37.628
-What?
-I've been trying to reach you.

08:37.840 --> 08:38.955
Where's your drop phone?

08:41.120 --> 08:43.554
-I've been busy.
-Well, clear your social calendar.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.150
-We have to cook.
-What? Today?

08:47.360 --> 08:49.669
No, you'll need today at least
to gather supplies.

08:49.880 --> 08:52.030
Now, we're going to need
all new glassware...

08:52.240 --> 08:54.629
...heating mantles,
about a hundred pounds of ice.

08:54.840 --> 08:57.593
Do you have a paper and pencil?
You should be writing this down.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.633
You wanna go shopping,
go do it yourself, all right? I got plans.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.479
Smoking marijuana,
eating Cheetos and masturbating...

09:03.680 --> 09:06.069
...do not constitute plans
in my book.

09:06.280 --> 09:08.271
Well, screw you and your book, man,
all right?

09:08.480 --> 09:11.313
I'm going to a museum in Santa Fe,
not like you need to know.

09:11.520 --> 09:15.559
-You're going to a museum, huh?
-Yeah. Georgia O'Keeffe.

09:15.760 --> 09:18.672
-Georgia O'Keeffe?
-She's a painter, duh.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.279
She does these vagina pictures.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.472
Or paintings, or just painted.
I don't know.

09:23.680 --> 09:25.033
What are you even talking about?

09:25.240 --> 09:28.277
Look, man, why am I even
explaining myself to you, all right?

09:28.480 --> 09:30.471
It's none of your damn business
what I'm doing.

09:30.680 --> 09:33.877
All you need to know is I ain't cooking
or shopping or whatever the hell.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.479
Let me explain something to you.

09:35.680 --> 09:38.592
You and I need to cook
through to next Tuesday.

09:38.800 --> 09:42.839
-Tuesday? Four days straight?
-Like it or not, we have no choice.

09:43.040 --> 09:46.191
Yeah? And why exactly is that?

09:48.080 --> 09:50.196
Our methylamine. It's going bad.

09:50.400 --> 09:52.550
-What?
-It's losing its chemical potency.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.752
Now, unless stealing another barrel
sounds good to you....

09:55.960 --> 09:57.188
Hell, no.

09:57.400 --> 09:59.914
All right, we have to act fast,
before it goes to waste.

10:00.120 --> 10:02.236
You have a paper and pencil?

10:03.600 --> 10:07.309
-Come on.
-All right, all right. Go.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.274
Okay, six mantles. Mantle? Mantle?

10:10.480 --> 10:12.596
What do you mean, mantle?
You mean like Mickey?

10:12.800 --> 10:14.756
I really wish
you didn't have to do this.

10:15.520 --> 10:17.272
Me too.

10:17.480 --> 10:19.152
But I'll be back before you know it...

10:19.360 --> 10:21.954
...and you can always call
if you need me.

10:22.160 --> 10:26.551
What, and risk talking to your mother?
Have to be some emergency.

10:36.640 --> 10:37.993
Love you.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.640
-Fly safe, okay?
-Okay.

11:04.640 --> 11:07.108
The white zone is for immediate
loading and unloading...

11:07.320 --> 11:08.639
...of passengers only.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.637
No parking.

11:18.680 --> 11:21.558
Attention, passengers:
Please maintain visual contact...

11:21.760 --> 11:23.990
...with your personal belongings
at all times.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.509
Any bags left unattended
will be confiscated...

11:26.720 --> 11:28.597
...by airport personnel.

11:36.320 --> 11:38.754
You brought a meth lab
to the airport?

11:38.960 --> 11:41.474
What? You said we were in a hurry.
I saved us a trip.

11:41.680 --> 11:43.750
Yeah. Did you get everything?
All six?

11:43.960 --> 11:46.190
-Yeah.
-With reflux condensers?

11:46.400 --> 11:47.913
Yes. Like I said, yes.

11:48.120 --> 11:52.591
-Just go. Drive. Go, go.
-Okay.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.679
Good morning to you too, man.

12:50.880 --> 12:54.031
-Stupid--
-Three entire bags of Funyuns?

12:54.240 --> 12:56.470
What? Funyuns are awesome.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.636
-God.
-Hey, more for me.

12:58.840 --> 13:01.593
How about something
with some protein maybe?

13:01.800 --> 13:03.995
Something green, huh?

13:04.200 --> 13:08.432
Man, I'm getting no service.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.915
How are you even alive?

13:12.680 --> 13:16.355
Hey, yo, check your phone.
You get any bars?

13:16.560 --> 13:18.198
Yeah, I've got a signal.

13:21.040 --> 13:24.669
-Hey, let me use yours, would you?
-Absolutely not.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.950
I have to assume
Skyler checks my phone records.

13:27.160 --> 13:29.116
-You know that.
-It's not business, all right?

13:29.320 --> 13:30.548
-It's personal.
-Oh, personal.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.433
-What, female?
-Maybe.

13:33.640 --> 13:35.392
Absolutely. That's all I need.

13:35.600 --> 13:37.795
Skyler hits redial
and some stripper answers.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.549
Look, she's not a stripper, okay?
Dickwad.

13:42.120 --> 13:44.429
Sorry. My wife checks.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.432
-Drinking water?
-Yup.

13:48.640 --> 13:50.232
Is that all we've got?

13:50.440 --> 13:54.194
Ten gallons?
What, you plan on taking a bath in it?

13:59.840 --> 14:01.068
Oh, God.

14:06.920 --> 14:10.515
No, not there.
That is our workstation.

14:10.720 --> 14:13.871
-Oh, our "workstation."
-That's right.

14:14.680 --> 14:18.116
Why don't you try to find a place
where it won't get lost?

14:18.320 --> 14:19.799
Considering it's our only set...

14:20.000 --> 14:22.833
...and we are a million miles
from nowhere.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.637
Why don't you try
sticking them up your ass sideways?

16:29.480 --> 16:31.630
Two-point-three-five pounds.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.479
Two-point-three-five.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.272
That's the last of it.

16:38.640 --> 16:42.030
-How many total?
-Nineteen.

16:42.560 --> 16:45.120
So dollar-wise?

16:45.320 --> 16:46.878
How much?

16:47.080 --> 16:50.072
Well, median weight 2.2 pounds...

16:50.280 --> 16:54.831
...that's 41.8,
call that 42 pounds, at....

16:55.040 --> 16:57.315
-What are we selling for these days?
-Forty a pound.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.193
-Forty thousand dollars?
-Hey, you said raise the prices.

17:00.400 --> 17:03.153
All right, that's 40 times 42...

17:03.360 --> 17:06.271
...minus distribution charges....

17:08.440 --> 17:09.555
What?

17:11.119 --> 17:12.348
What?

17:13.079 --> 17:15.310
Six hundred seventy-two
thousand dollars.

17:15.520 --> 17:18.034
-All in?
-No.

17:19.280 --> 17:20.759
Each.

17:21.359 --> 17:22.315
Each?

17:23.680 --> 17:26.035
-Each.
-Six hundred and--?

17:26.240 --> 17:28.595
Seventy-two thousand dollars each.

17:28.800 --> 17:32.110
Each. Yes! Hell, yeah!

17:32.320 --> 17:36.836
Hey, come high, baby.
Come on. Yes. Come on.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.718
Yes! Yes!

17:44.520 --> 17:47.318
Well, there goes the generator.

17:47.520 --> 17:49.750
I think that's it for the gas.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.393
Perfect timing, yo.

17:51.600 --> 17:54.353
-How do you figure that?
-What do you mean?

17:54.560 --> 17:55.515
We're done cooking.

17:55.720 --> 17:58.518
I am not done
until this barrel is empty.

17:58.720 --> 17:59.835
Look at this.

18:00.040 --> 18:03.157
I'd say we've still got 10, 12 gallons
of methylamine.

18:03.360 --> 18:06.352
-Come on, where's your ambition?
-Jesus. Seriously?

18:06.560 --> 18:08.755
We are way ahead of schedule, man,
all right?

18:08.960 --> 18:11.793
Plus the genny needs gas,
we're almost out of propane...

18:12.000 --> 18:14.798
...and my back is killing me
from that piece-of-crap cot.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.468
Come on, can we at least
just take the night off?

18:17.680 --> 18:20.114
Look, I don't have to take you back
till Tuesday, right?

18:20.320 --> 18:22.754
So we come back tomorrow,
strap on the sizzle...

18:22.960 --> 18:24.393
...and glass up the rest.

18:24.600 --> 18:25.555
Come on.

18:25.760 --> 18:28.513
There's gotta be a Denny's
out there someplace.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.312
Grand Slam?

18:30.520 --> 18:32.590
Hot shower?

18:32.800 --> 18:33.869
A bed?

18:38.480 --> 18:42.234
-Separate rooms.
-Yeah, that's a given.

18:44.960 --> 18:46.632
What the hell?

18:47.280 --> 18:50.238
What the...? The battery's dead.

18:52.800 --> 18:56.713
Jesse, back when I asked you
to put the keys in a safe place...

18:57.280 --> 18:58.474
...where did you put them?

18:58.680 --> 19:03.231
-I left them right here in the ignition.
-Son of a bitch.

19:03.440 --> 19:05.510
Whoa, whoa, no,
this is not my fault, all right?

19:05.720 --> 19:07.199
-The buzzer didn't buzz.
-The what?

19:07.400 --> 19:09.550
The buzzer that buzzes
when you put the keys in...

19:09.760 --> 19:11.318
...to let you know the battery's on.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.112
I know that. It didn't buzz.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.515
Look, I didn't turn the key
or anything, all right?

19:15.720 --> 19:18.518
I'm not stupid.
Did you hear the buzzer buzz?

19:18.720 --> 19:20.756
I did not. It's faulty.
It's a faulty mechanism.

19:20.960 --> 19:23.474
Is this just a genetic thing with you?
Is it congenital?

19:23.680 --> 19:26.194
Did your mother drop you
on your head when you were a baby?

19:26.400 --> 19:27.435
The buzzer did not buzz.

19:27.640 --> 19:29.710
And you're the one
that made me move the keys.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.478
Yes, I see your point.

19:31.680 --> 19:34.194
Your imbecility being what it is,
I should've known to say:

19:34.400 --> 19:37.472
"Jesse, don't leave the keys
in the ignition the entire two days."

19:37.680 --> 19:40.194
I wanted to leave them
on the counter, bitch.

19:40.400 --> 19:42.675
Oh, I'm sorry, oh, the workstation.

19:42.880 --> 19:44.711
-Jesus.
-Okay, just....

19:48.480 --> 19:52.519
All right, so we need
to jump the battery somehow.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.278
Okay.

19:54.480 --> 19:55.629
How?

20:04.480 --> 20:06.550
You gonna be okay?

20:07.040 --> 20:08.837
Oh, damn it.

20:10.360 --> 20:12.078
What's it taste like?

20:12.600 --> 20:13.669
Bad, huh?

20:20.680 --> 20:22.796
This is good.
This is good. Right here.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.912
Okay. There.

20:27.200 --> 20:29.714
Here. Red to red, black to black.

20:34.240 --> 20:38.950
Positive, negative.
All right. Start it up.

20:42.440 --> 20:44.590
What the hell's wrong
with this thing?

20:44.800 --> 20:47.598
-You have to really pull.
-I am.

20:47.800 --> 20:49.518
No, really pull, not like a girl.

20:49.720 --> 20:52.280
You know what? Pull this.
I am pulling.

20:52.840 --> 20:55.798
It just needs to warm up a little.
All right.

20:58.080 --> 20:59.149
Oh, my God.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.352
Oh, jeez.

21:25.680 --> 21:29.195
Well done, Jesse, as always. Just....

21:30.480 --> 21:31.913
Well done.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.919
God.

21:55.600 --> 21:58.876
Come on, you bitches.

21:59.080 --> 22:01.071
Hear me now.

22:02.680 --> 22:04.511
Damn it.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.992
Stupid.

22:16.920 --> 22:19.070
Okay, now we have to use
your phone.

22:19.280 --> 22:21.316
This is ruined. Do you understand?
Just ruined.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.438
You hooked it up wrong
and blew it up.

22:23.640 --> 22:26.279
No, no, no.
That is not what happened.

22:26.480 --> 22:27.549
How do you know?

22:27.760 --> 22:30.991
What I know is that I wasn't the one
who dumped out the last of our water.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.872
-That's what I know.
-There was a fire.

22:33.080 --> 22:34.832
Excuse me for thinking on my feet.

22:35.040 --> 22:37.031
Is that what you were--?
You were thinking?

22:37.240 --> 22:38.992
Now that we have
identified the problem--

22:39.200 --> 22:41.316
You and thinking,
that's the problem.

22:41.520 --> 22:46.355
Look, somebody is going to
have to pick us up, all right?

22:46.560 --> 22:48.710
Your wife is not gonna notice
one little call.

22:50.400 --> 22:52.436
Mr. White, come on.

22:52.920 --> 22:54.035
God.

22:54.240 --> 22:59.109
All right, look, just make it snappy.

22:59.320 --> 23:02.278
-Roaming drains the battery.
-All right.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.072
Yo, Skinny, hey.

23:07.280 --> 23:10.317
Yeah, yeah. Listen, man,
I need you to come pick us up.

23:10.520 --> 23:14.798
Now, all right? We're stuck out here.
You got a pen for directions?

23:15.000 --> 23:16.752
Look, pencil's fine, retard.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.315
Just something to write with.
It doesn't matter.

23:19.520 --> 23:20.794
All right, so you ready?

23:21.000 --> 23:24.913
All right, so you're gonna head west
on the 40 for like, what, 30 miles?

23:25.120 --> 23:29.557
And you're gonna go past the casino
with the big arrows in the parking lot.

23:29.760 --> 23:31.512
All right--
No, big arrows, giant arrows.

23:31.720 --> 23:33.836
They light up and blink.
You can't miss them.

23:34.040 --> 23:37.157
Then you're gonna wanna take it slow,
because there's this dirt road.

23:37.360 --> 23:40.113
It's right before the white sign
with a 3 on it, okay?

23:40.320 --> 23:42.959
Now you're gonna be way, way out
in the boonies, okay?

23:43.160 --> 23:47.233
Like crazy far, so just keep heading
down that dirt road for like what?

23:47.440 --> 23:49.158
About another 15 miles.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.999
-Really? That far?
-Yeah. Hurry up. The battery.

23:52.200 --> 23:55.158
All right, just go down that road
for like 15 more miles, all right?

23:55.360 --> 23:58.909
I mean, we're way the hell out here.
All right?

23:59.120 --> 24:02.476
Oh, and, yo, hey, listen.
Bring water.

24:02.680 --> 24:04.238
Leave now.

24:04.800 --> 24:06.199
Here.

24:06.400 --> 24:07.958
He's coming.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.435
There was this guy
on the Discovery Channel...

24:16.640 --> 24:18.949
...who broke his leg
mountain biking...

24:19.160 --> 24:21.720
...and he had to drink urine for....

24:21.920 --> 24:24.673
You know,
just until the forest ranger found him.

24:24.880 --> 24:30.750
He said it tasted like really hot,
really old soda.

24:33.360 --> 24:36.432
Look, we should just call, you know?

24:36.640 --> 24:40.269
I'll be quick, just be like,
"Yo, where are you?"

24:42.560 --> 24:43.959
All right.

24:54.040 --> 24:55.598
Come on.

24:57.400 --> 24:59.595
Yo. Yo, where are you?

25:00.480 --> 25:01.993
Oh, so you saw the white sign?

25:02.200 --> 25:04.634
Yes, he's almost here.

25:04.840 --> 25:08.469
Oh, man.
We're getting really freaked out.

25:08.680 --> 25:11.035
All right, so you're on the dirt road?

25:11.240 --> 25:13.151
He's on the dirt road. Good. Good.

25:13.360 --> 25:16.318
You just crossed the river?
Yeah. Have you seen anything?

25:16.520 --> 25:18.511
Wait, wait. What river?

25:19.640 --> 25:20.993
Yeah, hey, yo, what river?

25:21.200 --> 25:23.634
What the hell river you talking about?
There's no river.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.956
Hey, yo, Pete. Yo, Pete, can you--?

25:28.200 --> 25:29.713
Phone's dead.

25:34.320 --> 25:35.992
Now what?

25:38.720 --> 25:41.792
Mr. White, what now?

25:43.200 --> 25:46.431
Oh, come on. Seriously?

26:18.600 --> 26:20.272
What's this?

26:22.560 --> 26:24.391
I'm trying to...

26:24.840 --> 26:27.229
...trickle-charge the battery.

26:28.040 --> 26:29.917
Seriously?

26:30.320 --> 26:32.276
Just by turning that thing?

26:32.480 --> 26:34.198
The commutator.

26:34.880 --> 26:37.235
It's the part
which generates the electricity.

26:38.560 --> 26:42.189
Usually this little piston engine
turns it...

26:43.240 --> 26:46.312
...but considering that it's lying here
completely totalled....

26:50.720 --> 26:52.392
Anyway.

26:55.000 --> 26:57.230
Apply a little elbow grease.

26:57.760 --> 27:01.639
It'll take longer, a lot longer...

27:02.080 --> 27:04.594
...but theoretically...

27:05.760 --> 27:07.591
...it should work.

27:09.120 --> 27:10.951
Theoretically.

27:15.840 --> 27:17.398
It has to work.

27:18.240 --> 27:19.992
You understand?

27:29.280 --> 27:30.918
Can I try?

27:35.520 --> 27:36.919
Yeah.

28:10.600 --> 28:12.352
How much longer?

28:14.440 --> 28:16.032
I don't know.

28:30.760 --> 28:32.432
Now?

28:32.640 --> 28:34.198
Hey.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.718
Mr. White.

28:49.440 --> 28:50.839
Hey.

28:52.280 --> 28:53.599
Yeah?

28:55.680 --> 28:58.990
Yo, man, you hanging in?

28:59.800 --> 29:01.597
Yeah, I'm good.

29:03.840 --> 29:07.230
It's gotta be ready by now, right?

29:10.080 --> 29:12.548
No, give it a little longer...

29:12.760 --> 29:14.751
...just to make sure we're--

29:28.640 --> 29:31.200
Methylamine doesn't spoil...

29:31.400 --> 29:32.799
...does it?

29:35.680 --> 29:39.309
No. That's not why we're here.

29:50.840 --> 29:52.319
Yo.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.279
Lie much?

30:02.080 --> 30:03.593
Here, push.

30:17.600 --> 30:20.398
Okay, okay, okay.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.153
Now.

30:24.800 --> 30:26.153
Go on.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.393
Please, please, please.

30:48.080 --> 30:50.469
Yes. Yes.

30:53.640 --> 30:56.996
Come on. Damn. No, please, God.

30:57.200 --> 30:59.589
No. God.

31:01.520 --> 31:04.512
Please. Please.

31:20.880 --> 31:24.031
Why couldn't I have just gone
to Santa Fe?

31:24.240 --> 31:27.073
Why? Why?

31:32.560 --> 31:34.471
Mr. White.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.238
Mr. White!

31:43.320 --> 31:45.072
What are you doing?

31:46.640 --> 31:48.278
Mr. White?

31:49.520 --> 31:51.351
Oh, God.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.156
I have this coming.

32:12.640 --> 32:14.039
What?

32:16.600 --> 32:18.636
I have it coming.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.591
I deserve this.

32:23.120 --> 32:24.917
Hey, snap out of it.

32:25.120 --> 32:28.908
All right, first off, everything you did,
you did for your family.

32:29.120 --> 32:30.553
Right?

32:32.480 --> 32:35.199
All I ever managed to do...

32:35.560 --> 32:38.597
...was worry and disappoint them...

32:39.360 --> 32:41.032
...and lie.

32:42.560 --> 32:43.709
Oh, God.

32:44.680 --> 32:46.716
All the lies.

32:48.640 --> 32:50.278
I can't even....

32:50.480 --> 32:53.358
I can't even keep them straight
in my head anymore.

32:54.520 --> 32:57.080
You know what? Screw this.

32:57.280 --> 33:00.716
I'm walking. You can come or not.

33:02.440 --> 33:05.034
Where's my other shoe?

33:06.520 --> 33:09.318
Jesse. Jesse.

33:12.320 --> 33:14.151
Your body...

33:14.360 --> 33:18.035
...is running dangerously low
on electrolytes.

33:19.720 --> 33:23.110
Sodium, potassium, calcium.

33:23.480 --> 33:25.675
And when they're gone...

33:26.200 --> 33:29.510
...your brain ceases to communicate
with your muscles.

33:30.200 --> 33:35.558
Your lungs stop breathing,
your heart stops pumping.

33:35.760 --> 33:39.594
You go marching out there...

33:39.800 --> 33:43.509
...and within an hour,
you will be dead.

33:43.720 --> 33:47.633
Okay, you need to cut out
all your loser crybaby crap right now...

33:47.840 --> 33:49.671
...and think of something scientific.

33:49.880 --> 33:52.997
Something--
Something scientific, right.

33:53.200 --> 33:56.033
What? Come on, man.
You're smart, all right?

33:56.240 --> 33:58.800
You made poison out of beans, yo.

33:59.720 --> 34:02.109
All right, look. We got--

34:02.320 --> 34:07.235
We got an entire lab right here,
all right?

34:07.440 --> 34:09.396
How about you take
some of these chemicals...

34:09.600 --> 34:12.068
...and mix up some rocket fuel?

34:12.280 --> 34:15.078
And we can just send up
a signal flare.

34:15.280 --> 34:18.431
Or you make some kind of robot
to get us help...

34:18.639 --> 34:21.234
...or a homing device...

34:21.440 --> 34:23.192
...or build a new battery or....

34:23.400 --> 34:25.152
Or wait, no.

34:25.360 --> 34:27.510
What if we just take some stuff
off of the RV...

34:27.719 --> 34:31.030
...and build it into something
completely different?

34:31.239 --> 34:33.993
You know, like a....
Like a dune buggy.

34:34.199 --> 34:37.510
And that way,
we can just dune-buggy or....

34:38.360 --> 34:42.478
What? Hey. What is it?

34:43.560 --> 34:44.913
What?

34:45.800 --> 34:48.553
Do you have any money?

34:48.760 --> 34:49.829
Change, I mean. Coins.

34:50.040 --> 34:52.713
-Yeah, I got a bunch from the--
-Okay.

34:52.920 --> 34:54.672
-Yes.
-Gather them.

34:54.880 --> 34:58.589
And washers and nuts and bolts
and screws...

34:58.800 --> 35:02.031
...and whatever little pieces of metal
we can think of that is galvanized.

35:02.240 --> 35:05.676
It has to be galvanized or solid zinc.

35:05.880 --> 35:07.996
-Solid zinc, okay.
-And-- And bring me--

35:08.200 --> 35:10.475
Bring me brake pads.

35:10.680 --> 35:14.116
The front wheels should have discs.
Take them off and bring them to me.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.959
-Okay. Brake pads, okay.
-Brake pads.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.315
What are we building?

35:23.080 --> 35:25.913
-You said it yourself.
-A robot?

35:26.840 --> 35:28.159
-A battery.
-Yes.

35:28.360 --> 35:30.157
Move!

35:41.080 --> 35:44.959
This doesn't look like any battery
I ever saw.

35:45.160 --> 35:47.230
Well, trust me, it is a battery.

35:47.960 --> 35:51.032
Or rather, one cell of a battery.

35:52.400 --> 35:54.994
Here. Cut up the last two sponges.

35:55.200 --> 35:56.792
Remember the electrolytes?

35:58.120 --> 35:59.235
Well, think about it.

35:59.720 --> 36:02.951
A battery is a galvanic cell.

36:03.160 --> 36:05.799
It's no more than an anode
and a cathode...

36:06.000 --> 36:08.036
...separated by an electrolyte, right?

36:08.840 --> 36:10.717
-Right.
-Yeah, well, anyway.

36:10.920 --> 36:14.390
Here. On one side,
you have mercuric oxide...

36:14.600 --> 36:16.716
...and graphite
from your brake pads.

36:16.920 --> 36:20.913
This is the cathode.
This is the positive terminal.

36:21.120 --> 36:25.193
This is where the supply of current
flows out from, you see?

36:25.880 --> 36:27.916
Then.... Here, I'll show you.

36:28.120 --> 36:30.554
On the opposite side is our anode.

36:31.000 --> 36:32.513
This.

36:33.880 --> 36:35.359
It's zinc.

36:35.560 --> 36:40.429
It's what we find in our coins
and anything galvanized.

36:40.640 --> 36:43.916
-So the sponge is the electrolyte?
-Yeah.

36:44.120 --> 36:47.829
Well, no, the potassium hydroxide
is the electrolyte.

36:48.040 --> 36:51.953
But, yes, that's what I'm soaking
the sponges in.

36:52.920 --> 36:54.319
Good.

36:55.160 --> 36:59.870
Good. And now, what shall we use...

37:00.080 --> 37:02.640
...to conduct
this beautiful current with?

37:03.040 --> 37:07.955
What one particular element
comes to mind?

37:13.520 --> 37:15.317
Wire.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.833
Copper.

37:19.040 --> 37:20.996
-Oh, I mean--
-Copper.

37:21.200 --> 37:22.553
Right.

37:23.120 --> 37:27.432
The only question now is
will this supply enough current?

37:27.640 --> 37:30.438
And how many cells will we need?

37:30.640 --> 37:33.393
We've only got material enough
for six.

37:38.600 --> 37:40.192
Okay.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.992
Put the lid on. Wait. Positive.

37:46.200 --> 37:47.599
All right.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.398
Cathode.

37:56.320 --> 37:57.833
Anode.

37:58.040 --> 38:00.918
Damn. That is good.

38:01.120 --> 38:04.271
That is very good.
Okay. Here we go.

38:23.440 --> 38:24.395
Come on.

39:06.240 --> 39:09.152
Attention, passengers:
Please maintain visual contact...

39:09.360 --> 39:11.555
...with your personal belongings
at all times.

39:11.760 --> 39:14.149
Any bags left unattended
will be confiscated by....

39:14.360 --> 39:16.032
How's the...?

39:18.200 --> 39:19.633
It's fine.

39:30.440 --> 39:33.352
I know I can trust you to....

39:34.840 --> 39:36.558
Yeah.

39:38.320 --> 39:40.993
Hey, whatever happens...

39:41.440 --> 39:43.749
...your family will get your share.

39:46.560 --> 39:47.993
Thank you.

39:56.600 --> 39:58.158
So...

40:01.600 --> 40:04.876
...I'll be hearing from you, yeah?

40:08.560 --> 40:09.993
Yeah.

40:27.960 --> 40:29.837
How's everyone doing?

40:32.880 --> 40:35.519
Is that baby ever gonna come out,
you think?

40:36.720 --> 40:40.554
-I know. I know, enough already. It's--
-I'm teasing.

40:40.760 --> 40:42.637
Everything in its time.

40:44.480 --> 40:46.914
Walt, I have your scan results.

40:48.240 --> 40:51.630
-Yeah.
-You're showing signs of remission.

40:55.120 --> 40:57.588
-Oh, my God.
-I wanna clarify.

40:57.800 --> 41:00.394
There are misconceptions
about what remission signifies.

41:00.600 --> 41:02.875
It does not mean
that the patient is cured.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.038
To classify someone
as in remission...

41:05.240 --> 41:07.834
...we only need to determine
that the tumour hasn't grown.

41:08.040 --> 41:10.315
That it hasn't grown? Jesus.

41:11.000 --> 41:11.989
Technically speaking...

41:12.200 --> 41:15.112
...a tumour can remain
the exact same size it was before...

41:15.320 --> 41:17.675
...and the patient
could still be in remission.

41:17.880 --> 41:21.270
Now, in WaIt's case,
with a stage lll adenocarcinoma...

41:21.480 --> 41:23.391
...I'd like to see, I hope to see...

41:23.600 --> 41:27.070
...at least a 25- to 35-percent
reduction in tumour mass...

41:27.280 --> 41:32.559
...something to tell me that the cancer
has responded to the therapy.

41:32.760 --> 41:34.478
Everybody still with me?

41:35.960 --> 41:39.430
And how has my cancer responded?

41:39.640 --> 41:42.871
Walt, your tumour has shrunk
by 80 percent.

41:48.560 --> 41:50.312
-Oh, my God.
-Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry.

41:50.520 --> 41:52.670
Wait, I'm really.... I'm confused.

41:52.880 --> 41:55.189
Is--? Isn't 80 percent a lot?

41:56.160 --> 42:00.233
-Mom, yeah.
-Yes, 80 percent is a lot.

42:01.160 --> 42:03.435
-Okay, but, I'm-- Wait--
-Sweetheart, you were right.

42:03.640 --> 42:06.279
-It's very good news.
-It's very good news.

42:06.480 --> 42:09.392
-Oh, my God.
-My God, are you kidding me?

42:09.600 --> 42:13.639
Just when I try to get out,
they pull me back in.

42:22.040 --> 42:23.632
That's great.

42:25.240 --> 42:28.312
Now, that cough is the other thing
we need to discuss.

42:28.520 --> 42:32.229
According to your scan, Walt,
you have radiation pneumonitis.

42:32.440 --> 42:35.432
It's okay. This is fairly common.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.918
See that scary-looking thing there?

42:38.680 --> 42:41.797
That's tissue inflammation.
It's a reaction to your radiotherapy.

42:42.360 --> 42:45.113
It's usually not serious,
but it can produce a cough like that.

42:45.320 --> 42:47.311
I'll prescribe some prednisone.

42:47.520 --> 42:50.318
Tissue inflammation? I....

42:50.520 --> 42:52.397
Are you sure about that? I mean, l--

42:52.600 --> 42:58.152
Because the other day,
I was coughing up some blood.

42:59.520 --> 43:01.238
-What?
-You probably have a tear...

43:01.440 --> 43:02.953
...in your oesophagus
from coughing.

43:03.160 --> 43:05.833
That can be serious.
You could rupture and bleed to death.

43:06.200 --> 43:09.272
This is something we're gonna have to
deal with before you leave today.

43:09.480 --> 43:12.233
Wait a minute. When did this happen?
Why didn't you tell me?

43:12.440 --> 43:14.874
-I'm sorry, I just--
-No more secrets, Walt.

43:15.080 --> 43:18.629
With something like this,
you have to call me immediately.

43:20.120 --> 43:22.839
Now, with these results,
we're not completely out of the woods.

43:23.040 --> 43:24.871
But now at least
we have some options...

43:25.080 --> 43:27.833
...the most important of which
is time.

43:29.040 --> 43:31.190
We'll have more to discuss
in the next few weeks.

43:31.400 --> 43:35.029
But for now, I'd say that you folks
have earned some celebrating.

43:38.360 --> 43:40.157
-Yes.
-Yeah.

43:40.360 --> 43:41.475
Oh, my God.
