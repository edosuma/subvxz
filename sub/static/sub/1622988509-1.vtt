WEBVTT

01:36.864 --> 01:39.933
- Taking a break
already, eh, Nathaniel?

01:39.933 --> 01:41.469
- Yes, sir.

01:41.469 --> 01:44.238
Been out in those fields
since early this morning.

01:44.238 --> 01:45.173
- I see.

01:46.640 --> 01:49.877
How are those crops looking,
now those floods passed us by?

01:51.845 --> 01:55.616
- Some parts good.
Some parts poorly, sir.

01:55.616 --> 01:57.618
- Behaving poorly?

01:57.618 --> 02:00.388
- Yes, sir, because of
those floods you mentioned.

02:01.755 --> 02:04.358
- Those crops have plenty
of time to recover.

02:04.358 --> 02:06.294
- Yes, sir, they might.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.795
- They might?

02:07.795 --> 02:09.730
You better hope they might,

02:09.730 --> 02:11.665
or it comes outta your hide.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.867
- We all working on it, sir.

02:13.867 --> 02:16.804
- Nathaniel, you remember
them whuppings I used

02:16.804 --> 02:18.939
to give you when you
let your people slide.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.110
I know it's been a long time,

02:23.110 --> 02:26.079
but those whuppings can
come back, you hear me?

02:26.079 --> 02:27.481
- Yes, sir.

02:27.481 --> 02:28.682
- Okay then.

02:35.289 --> 02:37.958
- Did Nathaniel do
something wrong, Daddy?

02:37.958 --> 02:39.260
- Not really.

02:39.260 --> 02:41.295
- Why you treat him like that?

02:41.295 --> 02:45.633
- Wade, you gotta learn
how to treat these folks.

02:45.633 --> 02:46.734
Put the fear in them.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.339
Don't worry, I'll teach you.

03:31.011 --> 03:33.113
- Nathaniel, I told you
this was gonna happen

03:33.113 --> 03:35.283
if you didn't keep things right!

03:35.283 --> 03:36.650
- Yes, sir.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.208
- What you doing out?

04:01.208 --> 04:04.077
- I heard you yelling, wanted
to make sure you were okay.

04:05.346 --> 04:08.616
- Hurt, but I'll be all right

04:08.616 --> 04:10.518
in a few days, I reckon.

04:11.985 --> 04:14.722
- Why'd my daddy
hit you like that?

04:14.722 --> 04:17.558
- That's just what
he does, Wade.

04:22.463 --> 04:24.632
- Can I get you something?

04:25.766 --> 04:26.600
- No no.

04:27.968 --> 04:30.704
You shouldn't be
here. It's just ...

04:30.704 --> 04:32.873
- It's just that what?

04:32.873 --> 04:37.511
- One day, way off, you'll
be running this place.

04:40.113 --> 04:41.882
I want you to
promise me something.

04:43.016 --> 04:43.851
- Okay.

04:45.919 --> 04:48.522
- Promise me you
gonna treat my people

04:49.723 --> 04:51.258
better than your daddy did.

04:55.829 --> 04:56.664
- I promise.

04:58.899 --> 05:01.735
- Thank you. Now
get on back home.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.070
- Okay.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.530
- Is something
wrong, Master Wade?

05:29.530 --> 05:33.266
I figured you'd be outside
enjoying this fine weather.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.903
- Everything's okay.
I was just thinking.

05:37.037 --> 05:39.640
- Well, it must be
some powerful thinking

05:39.640 --> 05:41.442
if you had to come
in here to do it?

05:43.210 --> 05:45.579
- Sarah, when you
promise something,

05:45.579 --> 05:47.615
do you always have
to keep that promise?

05:47.615 --> 05:49.950
- I suppose you
should try, Wade.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.386
Somebody's promise
is their word,

05:52.386 --> 05:56.156
and keeping their word
is very important.

05:56.156 --> 06:00.794
- I know. It's hon,
hon, honorable.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.295
- That's right.

06:02.295 --> 06:05.399
If you don't mind me asking,
who'd you make the promise to?

06:07.067 --> 06:07.935
- Nathaniel.

06:11.371 --> 06:14.508
Nathaniel?
From the village?

06:17.611 --> 06:18.879
- Yes, ma'am.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.381
- What was the promise
you made, Master Wade?

06:22.450 --> 06:23.617
- Don't tell my pa.

06:24.952 --> 06:26.253
- Oh, I won't.

06:27.421 --> 06:29.490
- Last night, I saw him
beating on Nathaniel,

06:29.490 --> 06:34.261
giving him a real hard beating.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.696
- Did he know you were there?

06:37.698 --> 06:38.866
- Uh-uh.

06:38.866 --> 06:42.670
I saw Nathaniel later,
and he was hurt.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.639
- What did Nathaniel
have to say to you?

06:45.639 --> 06:48.141
- He asked me to promise
not to hurt his people.

06:49.677 --> 06:52.580
- Do you think you can keep
that promise, Master Wade?

06:54.014 --> 06:56.183
- I think I probably should.

07:28.749 --> 07:32.252
- Sir, supper should
be ready in an hour.

07:32.252 --> 07:33.754
- Thank you, Sarah.

07:33.754 --> 07:37.324
I saw you and my son speaking
in the sitting room earlier.

07:37.324 --> 07:40.494
- Yes, sir, we were talking
about keeping promises,

07:40.494 --> 07:42.129
that kinda thing.

07:42.129 --> 07:45.032
- What promise did he not keep?

07:45.032 --> 07:48.669
- Oh, well, he doesn't know
if it'll be kept or not.

07:50.738 --> 07:53.306
- I believe I know
what this is about.

07:54.742 --> 07:55.843
You do, sir?

07:57.410 --> 08:00.548
- Yeah, he took a
liking to my new rifle,

08:00.548 --> 08:03.050
and I promised I'd get
him one just like it.

08:04.217 --> 08:06.219
- Oh, I see.

08:06.219 --> 08:09.389
- Problem is, he's
a mite small still

08:09.389 --> 08:11.559
for a gun of that caliber.

08:11.559 --> 08:14.862
- Sir, may I suggest
the general store?

08:15.963 --> 08:16.864
- What for?

08:17.998 --> 08:20.033
- They have a fine
selection of toy guns

08:20.033 --> 08:22.369
that almost look
like the real ones.

08:24.972 --> 08:26.907
- That might buy
me a year or two?

08:28.308 --> 08:30.744
- Would you like me
to pick up a couple?

08:30.744 --> 08:32.145
I know you're busy.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.313
- If you don't mind.

08:34.314 --> 08:35.749
- Yes, sir.

08:35.749 --> 08:39.787
- I always tell him, a
man's word is his currency.

08:41.722 --> 08:43.824
You can't break your word.

09:00.540 --> 09:04.177
- Wade, Preston, y'all
about ready in there?

09:14.121 --> 09:15.055
That'll do.

09:18.391 --> 09:22.529
Preston, you aint going to
battle with your bare feet.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.564
- I'm still getting
my boots shined.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.133
You might
as well come in and see

09:26.133 --> 09:28.401
what kinda mischief
we're getting into.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.277
- Well look at that,
my three handsome men.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.479
Tell me, Wade, what
do we have here?

09:39.479 --> 09:44.484
- I'm the colonel, and
Wade is the aide-de-camp

09:45.218 --> 09:46.854
to General Johnston.

09:46.854 --> 09:49.356
Preston is my aide-de-camp.

09:49.356 --> 09:51.524
- That's wonderful.
What is an aide-de-camp?

09:51.524 --> 09:53.560
- We tell them what
to do, and they go out

09:53.560 --> 09:55.696
and tell everybody
else what to do.

09:55.696 --> 09:57.965
- Do you boys think
you can handle that?

09:57.965 --> 09:59.499
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

09:59.499 --> 10:01.534
- So where are y'all
heading off to?

10:01.534 --> 10:05.005
- Well we're not 100% sure.
We think it's Virginia.

10:05.005 --> 10:07.741
- Well dinner's almost ready,
so we better get in there.

10:12.579 --> 10:15.015
- Men, I have asked
you here today

10:15.015 --> 10:17.584
to tell you about my family.

10:17.584 --> 10:20.120
And I wanna tell you a
little bit about myself.

10:20.120 --> 10:23.724
I am Colonel Wade Hampton.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.894
My grandfather was in
the Revolutionary War,

10:26.894 --> 10:29.930
served with a man named
Harry Lighthorse Lee.

10:32.032 --> 10:35.736
You may not know him now,
but you will know his son.

10:35.736 --> 10:39.572
Robert E. Lee, he
is your commander.

10:39.572 --> 10:42.676
My father rode with a man by
the name of Andrew Jackson

10:42.676 --> 10:44.644
in the Battle of New Orleans.

10:44.644 --> 10:47.147
He actually carried
the victory message

10:47.147 --> 10:49.416
from the battlefield
to the White House.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.385
My heart and soul is
in South Carolina.

10:52.385 --> 10:54.788
You must watch everything
on the battlefield,

10:54.788 --> 10:57.390
because your life depends on it.

10:57.390 --> 11:00.861
There will be hand-to-hand
combat, which you will learn.

11:00.861 --> 11:04.364
There will be snipers
shooting above you.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.267
There will be artillery
fire over your head.

11:07.267 --> 11:09.870
Do not let this scare you.

11:09.870 --> 11:13.807
I want you to go out there
and give them your all.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.276
I want you to be tough as nails.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.678
I want you be strong as steel.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.480
I want you to go out
there and I want you

11:20.480 --> 11:22.049
to kill some Yankees.

11:22.049 --> 11:24.384
Gentlemen, this
will be an endeavor

11:24.384 --> 11:26.553
that you are soon to begin.

11:26.553 --> 11:28.388
Thank you for being here today,

11:28.388 --> 11:31.658
and thank you for your service.

11:31.658 --> 11:33.693
South Carolina depends on you.

11:51.511 --> 11:54.815
- This looks like as
good a place as any.

12:08.829 --> 12:11.364
Hm, thought there
mighta been a crowd.

12:11.364 --> 12:13.500
- Is there a schedule
of some kind?

12:13.500 --> 12:16.603
- It's a battle,
Lizzie, a real battle.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.876
- Someone's walking
around down there.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.178
- I see cannon.

12:29.349 --> 12:30.984
- Well I'll be.

12:30.984 --> 12:33.220
- What color are
those men wearing?

12:33.220 --> 12:34.387
- Looks like blue.

12:36.023 --> 12:36.957
- Is that our side?

12:38.158 --> 12:40.160
- I believe the Army
of the Confederacy

12:40.160 --> 12:42.762
will be wearing gray,
from what I've seen.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.265
- Well I hope it starts soon.

12:45.265 --> 12:48.301
- It'll start soon,
now just relax.

13:31.478 --> 13:32.445
Good morning.

13:33.881 --> 13:36.083
- Good morning, is this where
the battle's supposed to be?

13:36.083 --> 13:37.117
- Yes, it is.

13:47.527 --> 13:49.930
- We've been here
for a while now.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.899
Nothing's happened yet.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.867
- We've been here forever.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.570
- Oh now, we've only been
here a couple of hours.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.140
There's a lot of troop
movement down there.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.155
- What are you folk doing here?

14:16.389 --> 14:17.824
We're here
to watch the battle.

14:17.824 --> 14:19.026
- Where are you from?

14:20.427 --> 14:23.030
- We're from Manassas,
right down the road a bit.

14:23.030 --> 14:26.166
It was a very pleasant
ride here this morning.

14:26.166 --> 14:28.401
- We're from just outside
of Washington City.

14:29.436 --> 14:31.371
- Y'all are from Washington?

14:31.371 --> 14:34.041
- Ladies and gentlemen,
I do not believe

14:34.041 --> 14:37.610
you comprehend the gravity
of these circumstances.

14:37.610 --> 14:41.648
Right down the hill, I have
established a field hospital

14:41.648 --> 14:45.352
where I will be tending
wounded very shortly.

14:45.352 --> 14:48.155
- That's why we're here.
When does it start?

14:48.155 --> 14:50.823
- This is not a game or a play.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.893
Two armies will be
attacking each other.

14:53.893 --> 14:56.263
You are endangering
your own lives.

14:58.698 --> 14:59.532
- Finally.

15:01.534 --> 15:03.336
- All of you folk, all of you,

15:03.336 --> 15:04.904
need to leave here immediately.

15:09.209 --> 15:10.877
- Doesn't she understand?

15:10.877 --> 15:13.713
That's what we came here for.

15:13.713 --> 15:14.914
- Don't worry.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.884
If it gets too rough,
we'll bugger out.

16:02.395 --> 16:04.931
- Is this the way
it's supposed to look?

16:06.099 --> 16:08.401
- I can't tell who's
commanding the field.

16:08.401 --> 16:10.437
- Apparently, no one can.

16:10.437 --> 16:14.974
This is a perfect example
of how not to follow orders.

16:24.217 --> 16:25.752
- Ma'am.

16:25.752 --> 16:27.820
- Good afternoon, Colonel,
I shall fetch the doctor.

16:35.962 --> 16:39.199
- Colonel Hampton.
Just get here, sir?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.768
- Just a bit ago, they
been keeping your busy?

16:41.768 --> 16:43.936
- We're maintaining control.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.905
- The wounded
arrive sporadically.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.907
How's the battle going?

16:47.907 --> 16:49.842
- It's fixing to get worse.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.612
- My guess, it's about to
get a lot more ferocious.

16:52.612 --> 16:54.814
What
makes you say that?

16:54.814 --> 16:56.983
Hampton Legion's here.

16:56.983 --> 16:59.219
- I hope you can
end this quickly.

16:59.219 --> 17:01.354
- Well we'll end this all right.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.755
- They sure sound confident.

17:04.291 --> 17:06.626
- We'll have to make
more accommodations.

17:06.626 --> 17:09.862
Christine, the colonel
anticipates more wounded.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.164
- Right now?

17:11.164 --> 17:12.499
Soon.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.901
- I will get to the
well for more water.

17:14.901 --> 17:16.403
- What makes you think
you can do anything

17:16.403 --> 17:18.605
with that mess out there?

17:18.605 --> 17:20.039
- We just got a gun.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.176
Our brand-new
Enfield rifles from England.

17:23.176 --> 17:25.312
- They won't know what hit them.

17:25.312 --> 17:27.547
- Y'all just remember,
Hampton Legion's here now.

17:27.547 --> 17:28.448
We'll protect you.

17:29.616 --> 17:30.450
Ma'am.

17:49.001 --> 17:51.738
- Those horses are magnificent.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.040
- I think Daniel's
in the cavalry.

17:54.040 --> 17:55.708
- That's right.

17:55.708 --> 17:57.344
- Do you know
someone down there?

17:58.645 --> 17:59.912
- Yes, my husband.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.582
- Your husband's
fighting out there?

18:03.483 --> 18:04.717
- Yes.

18:04.717 --> 18:06.119
- No wonder you
came to see this.

18:12.725 --> 18:13.960
What color is he wearing?

18:16.296 --> 18:17.297
- He's wearing blue.

18:19.999 --> 18:23.670
- Well, we're here supporting
the Army of the Confederacy,

18:23.670 --> 18:25.938
under the command
of General Johnston.

18:27.207 --> 18:28.841
- Okay.

18:33.680 --> 18:35.148
- Do you hear that?

18:35.148 --> 18:37.817
- Those big guns
sure are powerful.

18:58.205 --> 19:00.673
- Well, that officer is
certainly doing his part.

19:00.673 --> 19:02.242
- Why aren't the men responding?

19:03.543 --> 19:06.045
- Many of them are
going home next week.

19:06.045 --> 19:09.349
I knew these short-term
enlistments were a bad idea.

19:34.140 --> 19:35.308
- What a mess.

19:36.609 --> 19:40.380
- They're all green,
both ours and theirs.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.481
- What the hell just happened?

19:41.481 --> 19:43.883
Why are we losing so many men?

19:43.883 --> 19:46.486
- The enemy's carrying
a new regimental flag.

19:46.486 --> 19:48.388
- I believe that's
South Carolina.

20:12.078 --> 20:15.114
- Doctor, you need to
take a look at this.

20:17.284 --> 20:19.452
- Christine, come quickly.

20:19.452 --> 20:22.522
Doctor, please wash your hands
before you touch his face.

20:25.425 --> 20:28.328
Colonel, you need
to put this in your report.

20:28.328 --> 20:30.263
- I'll do it, I'll do it.

20:50.317 --> 20:53.353
Looks like I didn't give
y'all too much to work with.

20:53.353 --> 20:55.788
- We have set up stations
all through the house

20:55.788 --> 20:57.324
for the wounded soldiers.

20:57.324 --> 21:00.293
We are trying to keep them
as comfortable as possible.

21:00.293 --> 21:02.261
- Christine, you can head
back to the house now.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.063
But when you're finished
in there, please come back

21:04.063 --> 21:06.299
and help me with the
soldiers in the tent.

21:06.299 --> 21:08.568
- Yes, I should be
finished in an hour or so.

21:11.738 --> 21:13.640
- How'd this happen?

21:13.640 --> 21:16.843
- We were in the heat of
battle. I didn't feel a thing.

21:16.843 --> 21:20.212
- You'll have to forgive Mary.
She's a little headstrong.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.349
But she's got a
lot of experience.

21:22.349 --> 21:23.750
- Nothing to forgive.

21:28.621 --> 21:30.490
- Our hospitals are
getting overwhelmed, sir.

21:30.490 --> 21:31.658
Should we pull back?

21:32.559 --> 21:34.494
- We are here for a reason.

21:34.494 --> 21:35.862
The men have to get
used to the idea

21:35.862 --> 21:39.098
that this is what
war looks like!

22:23.075 --> 22:26.479
- What are you folk
still doing here?

22:26.479 --> 22:28.515
- The children don't
wanna leave yet.

22:28.515 --> 22:29.749
- My husband's in this.

22:29.749 --> 22:31.784
I'm not leaving till
I know he's okay.

22:35.422 --> 22:37.557
- Do you know what this is?

22:37.557 --> 22:39.426
- Is that real blood?

22:39.426 --> 22:41.461
- Of course it is.
What else would it be?

22:42.829 --> 22:45.264
- I have spent the
entire afternoon

22:45.264 --> 22:47.434
tending to injured soldiers.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.638
Many had surgery, and
some did not survive.

22:52.839 --> 22:55.808
Now my hospital is about
100 yards down there,

22:55.808 --> 22:59.311
and it's only about 100 yards
away from the battlefield.

23:01.080 --> 23:04.884
I will have many more
wounded soldiers to patch up,

23:04.884 --> 23:09.021
and I do not want to have to
spend time tending to civilians

23:09.021 --> 23:11.858
who were too foolish to
get out of harm's way.

23:13.292 --> 23:14.827
- I think we need to go, John.

23:16.195 --> 23:19.265
- All right, well, we'll
pack things up then.

23:19.265 --> 23:21.000
- You have been warned.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.669
And that goes for you too.

23:29.208 --> 23:33.012
- Lizzie, Levi, help pick up.

23:35.782 --> 23:38.184
- Well, hold on
just a minute now.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.219
Another few minutes
won't hurt anything.

23:56.002 --> 23:58.337
- Casualties are heavy, Colonel.

23:58.337 --> 24:00.973
- I'm sure it's the same
on the other side, Major.

24:00.973 --> 24:03.510
Our men signed up for this
of their own free will.

24:05.612 --> 24:06.846
- I don't believe they knew what

24:06.846 --> 24:08.180
they were getting
themselves into.

24:30.336 --> 24:33.940
- What the hell
y'all doing here?

24:39.411 --> 24:41.047
Don't kill us.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.481
- Get the hell out of here!

24:42.481 --> 24:44.551
It aint time for a picnic!

24:47.486 --> 24:48.320
Come on.

24:49.589 --> 24:50.422
Come on!

24:56.162 --> 24:57.096
- Did you see that?

24:57.096 --> 24:59.098
Our men pushed their cavalry

24:59.098 --> 25:01.200
all the way back into the woods!

25:01.200 --> 25:03.836
- Looks like they scared off
that group of spectators.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.271
- Spectators?

25:06.472 --> 25:09.308
What are spectators doing here?

25:09.308 --> 25:10.442
They have no business!

25:12.679 --> 25:13.946
- Sir.

25:13.946 --> 25:15.948
- Kirkland, I heard you
was here. What happened?

25:15.948 --> 25:17.684
- Yanks shot my horse
out from under me.

25:17.684 --> 25:22.555
Bullet grazed my head, but my
horse took three hard hits.

25:22.555 --> 25:24.557
Poor thing slid sideways
for several yards.

25:24.557 --> 25:26.893
My leg got trapped under him.

25:26.893 --> 25:28.360
- What's the damage, Nurse?

25:28.360 --> 25:30.162
- That wound on his
head is still bleeding,

25:30.162 --> 25:32.632
but it did not
puncture his skull.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.100
He was quite fortunate.

25:34.100 --> 25:37.436
Another half-inch and it
would have blown his head off.

25:37.436 --> 25:39.171
That leg is the serious injury.

25:39.171 --> 25:41.808
- Busted up pretty
bad, she said.

25:41.808 --> 25:43.242
- Broken in four places.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.911
We set it as best we could.

25:46.579 --> 25:47.680
- Does it hurt much, Sergeant?

25:47.680 --> 25:49.916
- It was absolutely horrid,

25:49.916 --> 25:52.484
till these nice ladies
took care of me.

25:52.484 --> 25:55.221
- Our morphine supply
is adequate at present.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.989
But I don't know how
long it will last

25:56.989 --> 25:59.058
if these battles continue.

25:59.058 --> 26:00.627
- Sarge, don't you
worry about it.

26:00.627 --> 26:03.462
We'll make sure you get
home to your family.

26:03.462 --> 26:05.031
- Absolutely not, sir.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.866
Soon as I can walk again,
I'll be back in the fight.

26:06.866 --> 26:10.336
- That could be a very
long time, Sergeant.

26:10.336 --> 26:13.339
- Kirkland, it's probably
best that you recover at home,

26:13.339 --> 26:16.475
instead of being dragged
around who knows where.

26:16.475 --> 26:19.545
Once you feel you can ride,
we'll get you a fresh horse.

26:19.545 --> 26:22.815
- As long as you're
in the fight, sir,
I'll be in the fight.

26:22.815 --> 26:25.284
- Sergeant, I'll check
on you as soon as I can.

26:31.490 --> 26:33.525
Nurse, how long do
you think it'll be

26:33.525 --> 26:35.061
before he can ride again?

26:35.061 --> 26:37.697
- I don't know if he'll ever
even be able to walk again.

26:37.697 --> 26:41.768
And if he does, it will be
with a cane at the very least.

26:43.803 --> 26:48.808
- I understand.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.862
- Did you find out why that
company of our infantry

27:09.862 --> 27:12.264
just walked off the field?

27:12.264 --> 27:15.034
- Heard tell they were
headed back to Washington.

27:15.034 --> 27:17.269
General direction anyway.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.871
- Washington?

27:18.871 --> 27:20.773
That's over 20 miles from here.

27:20.773 --> 27:22.709
It would have been
so lovely of them

27:22.709 --> 27:25.011
to inform us of
their destination.

27:26.178 --> 27:28.514
- I don't think they
care anymore, sir.

27:28.514 --> 27:30.449
- This is desertion.

27:30.449 --> 27:33.853
I want their officer
and every man, ow!

27:33.853 --> 27:34.754
Ow!

27:34.754 --> 27:36.155
- Colonel!

27:36.155 --> 27:40.492
- Ow, oh, please
don't touch that arm.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.628
I've been shot in the elbow.

27:44.596 --> 27:45.998
- Are you sure it's the elbow?

27:45.998 --> 27:49.035
- Yes, I'm sure it's the elbow.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.636
- Let's get you to the hospital.

28:24.203 --> 28:26.873
- Good afternoon, Sergeant
Major, how may I help you?

28:42.889 --> 28:44.223
- Caught a piece of something,

28:44.223 --> 28:46.592
Shrapnel, I don't
know, or something.

28:46.592 --> 28:48.527
- Have a seat. Let's
take a look at it.

29:04.443 --> 29:06.946
I can fix that up for
you. Does it hurt much?

29:06.946 --> 29:07.980
- What do you think?

29:16.388 --> 29:17.489
- Mary!

29:17.489 --> 29:18.690
- I'm coming, Christine.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.671
This looks serious.

29:38.577 --> 29:40.112
- So is mine.

29:40.112 --> 29:43.649
Sergeant Major,
this man has a bullet in him.

29:43.649 --> 29:47.820
Yours is not life-threatening.
Please be patient.

29:49.688 --> 29:51.757
- I aint trying to
cause no trouble here!

29:54.193 --> 29:55.494
- I hope not.

29:56.929 --> 29:59.866
- What I mean is, we
supposed to be first

29:59.866 --> 30:01.367
when it comes to medical.

30:01.367 --> 30:03.502
- Did you not just
hear me tell you

30:03.502 --> 30:06.305
that this man has a
life-threatening injury?

30:11.277 --> 30:13.812
- I'm just telling you the
way it's supposed to be.

30:16.748 --> 30:21.120
- Sergeant Major, Mary
is very busy right now,

30:21.120 --> 30:23.923
and she is the only
one here at present

30:23.923 --> 30:26.125
qualified to do
what she is doing.

30:27.359 --> 30:31.030
So I would suggest, you
allow us to proceed,

30:31.030 --> 30:33.699
and at the proper
time, we will find you.

30:34.633 --> 30:35.567
Thank you.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.014
- Thank you.

30:50.782 --> 30:52.885
- I didn't see you
eat much today.

30:52.885 --> 30:54.786
You must keep up your strength.

30:58.624 --> 31:01.193
- It has been a chaotic day,

31:01.193 --> 31:04.296
far busier than any of us
could have anticipated.

31:04.296 --> 31:07.699
- A long battle, and
so many casualties.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.002
Do you think they
were expecting this?

31:10.002 --> 31:11.270
- No I don't.

31:11.270 --> 31:13.272
It was certainly more
than the picnic crowd

31:13.272 --> 31:14.440
could have anticipated.

31:15.641 --> 31:17.076
- What were they thinking?

31:17.076 --> 31:19.211
- They were thinking it
was going to be quick

31:19.211 --> 31:22.248
and easy, and it
will be neither.

31:22.248 --> 31:25.717
These politicians have no
idea what they've started.

31:25.717 --> 31:29.688
- So, who did you see today
that tickled your fancy?

31:31.190 --> 31:32.558
- You mean men.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.293
- Of course I mean men.

31:34.293 --> 31:37.463
So many fine
specimen here today.

31:37.463 --> 31:40.766
- Spoken like the school
teacher you are, Christine.

31:42.234 --> 31:45.237
But I'm not looking for
another husband right now.

31:45.237 --> 31:48.040
- Well I must admit that I am.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.676
Surely one of these
strapping officers

31:50.676 --> 31:52.411
would love a fine German wife.

31:53.845 --> 31:55.581
So who did you find interesting?

31:57.883 --> 32:01.653
- I will tell you who I respect.
It's that Colonel Hampton.

32:02.488 --> 32:03.956
Why so?

32:03.956 --> 32:06.092
- For one thing,
he's very wealthy.

32:06.092 --> 32:08.294
- Oh, I like him already.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.162
- He's quite married, my dear.

32:11.463 --> 32:13.966
But the reason I
respect him so much is

32:13.966 --> 32:17.669
that he financed his
entire operation himself,

32:17.669 --> 32:20.372
that army he calls
Hampton's Legion.

32:20.372 --> 32:21.640
Did he now?

32:21.640 --> 32:23.709
- Yes, and I have done
something similar,

32:23.709 --> 32:26.645
though not quite
such a grand scale.

32:27.813 --> 32:29.248
- What do you mean?

32:29.248 --> 32:32.651
- My field hospital. I
paid for everything myself.

32:33.619 --> 32:35.087
- I had no idea.

32:36.522 --> 32:40.993
So, what do you hope to
reap from your investment?

32:40.993 --> 32:42.694
A political appointment perhaps?

32:43.862 --> 32:46.898
- If women could
only hold office.

32:46.898 --> 32:49.068
You know, I would be
happy to get the vote.

32:50.302 --> 32:53.072
But as a nurse,
you know my concern

32:53.072 --> 32:55.474
has been with saving lives.

32:55.474 --> 32:57.476
And this is one
arena where I can put

32:57.476 --> 32:59.111
my concerns into action.

33:00.479 --> 33:02.481
So you
will continue to do this?

33:02.481 --> 33:04.383
- Yes, as long as it's needed.

33:04.383 --> 33:07.453
And I think it will be
needed for a very long time.

33:07.453 --> 33:10.722
- And I will help, if
that meets your approval.

33:10.722 --> 33:14.593
- Of course it does. You
were invaluable here today.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.595
We need to show these
men that nursing

33:16.595 --> 33:19.065
is a profession for
respectable women.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.443
- What's the matter with
this soldier here, ma'am?

38:31.443 --> 38:32.878
I noticed the blue coat.

38:35.414 --> 38:38.049
- Yes, General, he
was bleeding profusely

38:38.049 --> 38:40.352
and probably would
not have survived

38:40.352 --> 38:43.589
if he had tried to reach
the Federal hospital.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.826
- What's your name, Soldier?

38:47.826 --> 38:51.296
- Francis Peffer, Private,
19th Indiana Infantry,

38:51.296 --> 38:52.498
United States Army.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.967
- All righty, if you
wanna play that game.

38:55.967 --> 38:59.671
Wade Hampton, General,
Confederate States of America.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.743
Something you don't understand
about that, Trooper?

39:04.743 --> 39:06.978
- The way I see it,
you're all outlaws.

39:06.978 --> 39:08.447
Outlaw leadership.

39:09.848 --> 39:10.982
Outlaw government.

39:14.252 --> 39:16.622
- You might wanna consider
that these outlaws

39:16.622 --> 39:18.390
just saved your life.

39:25.296 --> 39:29.134
- Ladies, I am indebted
to you, for your service.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.374
General?

39:36.374 --> 39:37.476
- Yes, Private.

39:39.010 --> 39:41.146
- Sir, if you don't
mind me asking,

39:41.146 --> 39:43.048
what's going to happen to me?

39:43.048 --> 39:46.785
- Well, we got a good many
prisoners on both sides now.

39:46.785 --> 39:50.021
I would say that we're due
for a prisoner exchange.

39:51.156 --> 39:53.091
But don't hold me to that.

39:53.091 --> 39:54.192
- Thank you, sir.

39:54.192 --> 39:56.928
And I am a volunteer.

39:58.163 --> 39:59.230
- I am too.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.548
- I believe there's
something you wanted to talk

40:16.548 --> 40:19.050
with me about
concerning Sharpsburg.

40:19.050 --> 40:21.319
- Yes, General, my scouts
have turned up a way

40:21.319 --> 40:24.590
through the woods that would
save us a lotta trouble.

40:24.590 --> 40:27.993
- What exactly would we be
moving through the woods?

40:27.993 --> 40:28.827
- Cavalry.

40:30.395 --> 40:31.229
- Cavalry.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.934
I'm not so sure
that's realistic.

40:35.934 --> 40:37.503
- Dismounted cavalry.

40:37.503 --> 40:41.439
No heavy guns, so we don't
bring the horses in first.

40:42.874 --> 40:44.676
That'll put us right on
the rear of the Yankee camp

40:44.676 --> 40:47.212
and still give us the
element of surprise.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.481
- As you know, I tend to favor

40:49.481 --> 40:52.117
a frontal assault
in these situations.

40:52.117 --> 40:55.053
- Which I would understand
if troop strength was equal.

40:55.053 --> 40:58.456
However, McLellan may have
up to twice our number

40:58.456 --> 41:00.626
if you count his reserves.

41:00.626 --> 41:02.794
- He may not bring
in his reserves.

41:04.395 --> 41:08.967
So, I think this
through-the-woods
idea is untried.

41:11.236 --> 41:14.239
And with as much
as we have to risk,

41:14.239 --> 41:15.707
I just can't support it.

48:04.382 --> 48:07.552
- Corporal Jones, you're
going to have to stay still

48:07.552 --> 48:11.356
while I change this, or you
are going to keep bleeding.

48:11.356 --> 48:13.491
- It hurts! It hurts so much!

48:14.659 --> 48:16.261
- Nurse, what's
the problem here?

48:16.261 --> 48:18.997
- General, a bullet went
through this man's chest.

48:18.997 --> 48:20.898
We don't believe it
struck his heart,

48:20.898 --> 48:24.202
but he must calm
himself or he will die.

48:24.202 --> 48:25.036
- Corporal?

48:26.304 --> 48:27.805
- General, sir.

48:27.805 --> 48:30.541
- You got to do what the
nurses tell you, Soldier.

48:30.541 --> 48:31.376
- General, sir.

48:32.277 --> 48:34.745
The pain, horrible.

48:34.745 --> 48:37.315
- General, we have
run out of morphine.

48:40.185 --> 48:42.087
We have a little
laudanum left, Christine.

48:42.087 --> 48:43.221
This will have to do.

48:49.694 --> 48:51.529
- Please listen, Corporal.

48:51.529 --> 48:55.233
This will help the pain,
but you must stay still.

48:55.233 --> 48:59.104
- General, these weapons
are tearing our men apart.

48:59.104 --> 49:02.140
- 57 caliber, large bullets.

49:03.441 --> 49:06.411
- These bullets rip
right through them.

49:06.411 --> 49:08.746
The exit wounds are ungodly.

49:08.746 --> 49:11.549
- Well, coulda been worse.
Coulda been canister shot.

49:12.984 --> 49:14.285
I've heard of it.

49:14.285 --> 49:16.087
What exactly is it?

49:16.087 --> 49:18.689
- They take the round
balls, put them in a can,

49:18.689 --> 49:20.825
seal it up, put a
cannonball on top, fire it,

49:20.825 --> 49:24.529
it explodes and rains
down on the troops.

49:24.529 --> 49:26.164
- That is savage.

49:27.365 --> 49:28.299
Yes it is.

49:29.434 --> 49:31.769
- Would you use
something like that?

49:31.769 --> 49:34.939
- Ma'am, I'd use anything
I could to win this war.

49:41.246 --> 49:42.513
- I was right about one thing.

49:42.513 --> 49:44.482
He didn't bring up a
lot of his reserves.

49:45.883 --> 49:46.817
- No, sir.

49:48.119 --> 49:51.322
- Casualties were
extremely high,

49:51.322 --> 49:52.990
on both sides, I might add.

49:54.125 --> 49:57.195
We just simply can't
afford to engage

49:57.195 --> 49:59.497
in a situation like this again.

49:59.497 --> 50:03.901
- So we are disengaging our
adventure into Maryland?

50:05.136 --> 50:06.003
- Yeah, we are.

50:09.174 --> 50:10.775
- Nurse Wilkins?

50:10.775 --> 50:11.976
- Good afternoon, General.

50:11.976 --> 50:13.278
Were you looking for someone?

50:13.278 --> 50:14.379
- I was, you.

50:18.416 --> 50:20.918
- Very well, how
may I be of help?

50:20.918 --> 50:23.354
- I may have some
unfortunate news for you.

50:23.354 --> 50:25.223
We need
no more of that.

50:25.223 --> 50:26.624
What have you heard?

50:26.624 --> 50:29.560
- The president, Jefferson
Davis, has decreed

50:29.560 --> 50:32.797
that all hospitals
become military hospitals

50:32.797 --> 50:34.765
and ran by a officer.

50:36.167 --> 50:37.001
- An officer?

50:39.304 --> 50:41.306
What is the purpose of that?

50:41.306 --> 50:44.975
- I would suggest
to hurry up supplies

50:44.975 --> 50:46.377
and to maintain order.

50:51.849 --> 50:54.585
This does not
diminish our gratitude

50:54.585 --> 50:58.823
for everything you have
done, Nurse Wilkins.

50:58.823 --> 50:59.790
- I have an idea.

51:03.094 --> 51:04.562
- And what might that be?

51:05.796 --> 51:08.999
- May I suggest that
you commission me?

51:08.999 --> 51:10.801
Then I can continue
to administer

51:10.801 --> 51:12.570
the hospital as an officer.

51:14.038 --> 51:16.741
- Well, uh.

51:18.343 --> 51:20.010
I don't know about that.

51:20.010 --> 51:22.280
- This arrangement would
be of great benefit

51:22.280 --> 51:24.949
to the Army of the Confederacy.

51:24.949 --> 51:26.817
You do understand that?

51:26.817 --> 51:29.320
- Yes I do, but like me,

51:29.320 --> 51:31.789
you pay for your whole
arrangement, but--

51:31.789 --> 51:34.692
- I am also a
professional nurse.

51:34.692 --> 51:36.227
When I was in London, I attended

51:36.227 --> 51:39.530
Miss Florence Nightingale's
Academy of Nursing.

51:39.530 --> 51:41.332
That is where I
learned the importance

51:41.332 --> 51:43.201
of hygiene and sanitation.

51:44.435 --> 51:46.704
That is why I insist
that my doctors wash

51:46.704 --> 51:48.973
their hands between
every patient,

51:48.973 --> 51:51.676
and why my hospital
has the highest

51:51.676 --> 51:53.411
successful recovery rate.

51:54.545 --> 51:57.582
I am immensely qualified
for this position.

51:58.583 --> 52:01.586
- Of that, I have no doubt.

52:01.586 --> 52:03.288
But the Army of
Northern Virginia

52:03.288 --> 52:06.524
does not commission
female officers.

52:06.524 --> 52:10.161
- Females in this war
have excelled at tasks

52:10.161 --> 52:13.464
that they were once
considered unfit for.

52:13.464 --> 52:15.900
Men need to acknowledge this.

52:15.900 --> 52:18.203
You yourself are acutely aware

52:18.203 --> 52:20.371
of how much I am
needed out here.

52:25.843 --> 52:27.912
- Let me think on
this for just a bit.

52:32.116 --> 52:34.084
- So what you're telling
me, General Hampton,

52:34.084 --> 52:36.487
is that we're running
outta everything?

52:36.487 --> 52:38.556
- I'm not as concerned
about my legion.

52:38.556 --> 52:41.659
As you know, I pay
for everything.

52:41.659 --> 52:45.663
- I continue to commend
you highly for that.

52:45.663 --> 52:47.265
- Thank you.

52:47.265 --> 52:49.434
But I can't do
that beyond my men.

52:49.434 --> 52:53.838
My concern is with the units
that I'm fighting alongside.

52:53.838 --> 52:56.674
- I understand that.
So what do you suggest?

52:56.674 --> 53:00.478
- Well, we need to stop
losing so many soldiers.

53:00.478 --> 53:02.480
- And how would we do that?

53:02.480 --> 53:05.550
- One way is to
substantially increase

53:05.550 --> 53:08.719
the recovery rate
at field hospitals.

53:08.719 --> 53:11.088
- Same question,
how do we do that?

53:11.088 --> 53:14.124
- By working with
somebody who's done it.

53:15.560 --> 53:17.595
- All right, who's he?

53:17.595 --> 53:19.096
She.

53:19.096 --> 53:20.598
- A nurse?

53:20.598 --> 53:23.100
- Her name is Mary Wilkins.

53:23.100 --> 53:26.637
I first saw her
operation at Manassas.

53:26.637 --> 53:29.674
She runs her own field
hospital, and right now,

53:29.674 --> 53:33.911
her survival rate is 97%.

53:33.911 --> 53:35.280
- That's wonderful.

53:36.481 --> 53:38.849
So what's the problem?
Does she wanna leave?

53:38.849 --> 53:43.321
- General, you may remember
that Jefferson Davis decreed

53:43.321 --> 53:48.158
that all field hospitals must
have an officer in charge.

53:49.460 --> 53:53.264
- Okay, I remember
something about that, yeah.

53:53.264 --> 53:56.901
- I don't wanna lose Miss
Wilkins or her operation.

53:56.901 --> 53:59.003
I believe we need her out there,

53:59.003 --> 54:02.006
and my officers
feel the same way.

54:02.006 --> 54:03.974
- So what are you proposing?

54:03.974 --> 54:07.011
- I'd like to forward a
letter to Jefferson Davis

54:07.011 --> 54:11.416
requesting permission to
commission her in the army.

54:12.783 --> 54:15.019
- General Hampton, I
would love to discuss this

54:15.019 --> 54:18.789
with you at length, but
we've got so many matters

54:18.789 --> 54:21.025
on the table, I
just don't have time

54:21.025 --> 54:22.793
to talk about it right now.

54:22.793 --> 54:25.262
- So I have your
support on this?

54:25.262 --> 54:27.197
- For right now, yes.

54:27.197 --> 54:28.065
So what else?

54:37.475 --> 54:40.044
- I believe you
wanted to see me.

54:40.044 --> 54:41.211
Have a seat, gentlemen.

54:43.314 --> 54:45.015
What's on your mind?

54:45.015 --> 54:47.418
- Well, sir, the sergeant
and the corporal here

54:47.418 --> 54:49.720
got a idea they
wanna share with you.

54:49.720 --> 54:51.255
- All right, let's have it.

54:53.658 --> 54:55.360
- Yes, sir, the corporal
and I have been involved

54:55.360 --> 54:57.261
in several special missions.

54:57.261 --> 55:00.264
- Well, sir, most
of these missions

55:00.264 --> 55:02.266
have been dreamed up
by the captain here.

55:04.869 --> 55:06.337
- Special missions, huh?

55:06.337 --> 55:09.840
Do I know about these
special missions, Captain?

55:09.840 --> 55:12.276
- Well, some you do
and some you don't.

55:13.378 --> 55:14.645
- I see.

55:14.645 --> 55:17.281
Certainly, do tell.

55:17.281 --> 55:19.183
- We've conducted several
missions behind enemy

55:19.183 --> 55:21.118
lines on the supply chain.

55:21.118 --> 55:23.388
- These raids have
been very effective.

55:23.388 --> 55:26.657
- Well, sometimes it's just
me and Sergeant Causey,

55:26.657 --> 55:28.993
and sometimes ...

55:28.993 --> 55:30.160
- Sometimes what?

55:31.261 --> 55:33.297
- Sometimes, I go with him.

55:34.365 --> 55:35.500
- Why?

55:36.667 --> 55:38.636
- On account of he's
pretty good at it.

55:38.636 --> 55:40.705
- We make a pretty good team.

55:40.705 --> 55:42.306
- A team?

55:42.306 --> 55:45.175
Just you three in this team?

55:45.175 --> 55:47.144
- Sometimes we
bring sharpshooters.

55:47.144 --> 55:50.047
- Sometimes, explosive experts.

55:53.684 --> 55:56.153
- How long has
this been going on?

55:56.153 --> 55:56.987
- About a year.

55:58.355 --> 56:02.092
- Really? And when was you
gonna get around to telling me?

56:02.092 --> 56:03.561
- This evening.

56:03.561 --> 56:07.097
- Okay, fellas, what
do y'all want from me?

56:07.097 --> 56:08.699
- We're giving the group a name.

56:10.134 --> 56:12.537
Just wanna let you know
in case you hear about it.

56:12.537 --> 56:15.172
- Oh well, thanks for
keeping me informed.

56:15.172 --> 56:16.373
What'd you come up with?

56:17.274 --> 56:18.876
- Band of Confederates.

56:24.482 --> 56:27.117
- If the captain here
is involved with any

56:27.117 --> 56:30.888
of these shenanigans, I
wanna know all the way.

56:34.692 --> 56:37.528
Good, now I have an
announcement for you.

56:38.663 --> 56:42.299
We been blessed to work
with the best nurse

56:42.299 --> 56:44.234
in this here Confederate Army,

56:44.234 --> 56:45.836
and that would be Mary Wilkins.

56:47.672 --> 56:49.173
- She's good.

56:49.173 --> 56:53.544
- Recently, our president,
Jefferson Davis, has decreed

56:53.544 --> 56:58.549
that those that run our
hospitals now be officers.

56:58.549 --> 57:02.587
Of course, that would put Miss
Wilkins outta the running.

57:02.587 --> 57:06.457
Let me ask y'all, do we
wanna lose Miss Wilkins?

57:06.457 --> 57:07.558
- No.

57:07.558 --> 57:08.993
- No, sir.

57:08.993 --> 57:12.396
- Today, I received a
letter that commissions

57:12.396 --> 57:14.899
Mary Wilkins as an officer.

57:17.502 --> 57:19.570
- This ever been done before?

57:19.570 --> 57:22.172
- No it has not, but
it took a piece of work

57:22.172 --> 57:23.273
to get this done.

57:24.742 --> 57:27.311
I'm presenting this letter
to Mary in a few minutes,

57:27.311 --> 57:29.480
and I would love for
y'all to join me.

57:29.480 --> 57:30.615
- Well certainly, sir.

57:30.615 --> 57:31.916
- Okay, let's do it.

57:34.785 --> 57:36.754
- Something wrong, Sergeant?

57:36.754 --> 57:40.290
- Well, sir, I'm not one
to complain, but um ...

57:40.290 --> 57:42.059
- Yes, Soldier?

57:42.059 --> 57:44.662
- Sir, I believe I've been
qualified for promotion

57:44.662 --> 57:46.296
for several years now.

57:46.296 --> 57:50.134
I'm just wondering, why
have I been passed over?

57:50.134 --> 57:53.037
- I would need a letter of
recommendation, Sergeant Major.

57:54.271 --> 57:55.640
- I would do it.

57:55.640 --> 57:57.407
- Find another
officer to sign off.

57:58.776 --> 57:59.977
- You?

57:59.977 --> 58:02.046
- Can't be me. You gotta
find somebody else.

58:04.414 --> 58:06.116
- Okay, sir, thank you.

58:09.520 --> 58:13.023
- Mary Wilkins, for
outstanding service in support

58:13.023 --> 58:16.727
for the Army of Northern
Virginia, you have been

58:16.727 --> 58:19.129
commissioned to the
rank of captain.

58:27.572 --> 58:29.940
Is there anything you'd
like to say, Mary?

58:29.940 --> 58:32.376
- I sincerely appreciate
this opportunity, sir,

58:32.376 --> 58:36.180
and I am honored to
accept this commission.

58:36.180 --> 58:37.582
- You're supposed to salute.

58:49.660 --> 58:52.396
- As a duly commissioned
officer, I would like

58:52.396 --> 58:54.865
to recommend
Sergeant Major Causey

58:54.865 --> 58:57.668
for promotion to officer rank,

58:57.668 --> 59:00.671
to be determined by
General Hampton, of course.

59:00.671 --> 59:02.840
- Well hell, I think
this is gonna work out.

59:05.710 --> 59:09.113
- And Lord, please watch
over our house servant,

59:09.113 --> 59:13.317
Sarah Baker, who left this
world to join you last month.

59:15.052 --> 59:17.554
Christmas, 1863.

59:17.554 --> 59:19.456
The dinner will be
ready in a few minutes,

59:19.456 --> 59:22.126
and I have really been
looking forward to this.

59:25.763 --> 59:28.298
Every year since
this war started,

59:28.298 --> 59:31.335
we've had a special guest
for Christmas dinner.

59:31.335 --> 59:35.740
This year, it's
Sergeant Major Causey.

59:35.740 --> 59:37.975
- Thank you for having me here.

59:37.975 --> 59:40.210
- One of my finest
cavalry soldiers.

59:40.210 --> 59:43.648
He's been with me from
Manassas to Gettysburg,

59:43.648 --> 59:45.282
and he's still with me.

59:45.282 --> 59:47.952
- It's been a privilege
serving with you, General.

59:47.952 --> 59:49.654
- So, Sergeant, tell
me about your people.

59:49.654 --> 59:51.388
Where are you from?

59:51.388 --> 59:54.692
- A small town right
up the road, Brunson.

59:54.692 --> 59:57.361
- The sergeant here can be a
real terror on the battlefield.

59:57.361 --> 59:59.196
- He fights like a wild animal.

59:59.196 --> 1:00:01.298
- Well, I don't
know about all that.

1:00:01.298 --> 1:00:03.500
- Boys, you're
embarrassing the sergeant.

1:00:03.500 --> 1:00:05.703
Do tell me about your horse.

1:00:05.703 --> 1:00:07.838
- Yes, ma'am. His name's Walker.

1:00:07.838 --> 1:00:10.107
He's been with me
a good long while.

1:00:10.107 --> 1:00:12.109
- They both been
shot a couple times.

1:00:12.109 --> 1:00:13.543
- Really?

1:00:13.543 --> 1:00:15.880
- Thankfully, it didn't
hit anything vital.

1:00:15.880 --> 1:00:18.282
- I hope you brought your
appetite with you, Sergeant.

1:00:18.282 --> 1:00:20.951
You're in a for a real treat.

1:00:20.951 --> 1:00:22.753
- That's what I'm told.

1:05:40.937 --> 1:05:42.973
- See anything, General?

1:05:42.973 --> 1:05:45.075
- I seen a few skirmishes
over that way earlier.

1:05:45.075 --> 1:05:47.111
Here, you take a look.

1:05:58.855 --> 1:06:00.790
- General, we're ready to go.

1:06:02.226 --> 1:06:03.060
- Preston!

1:06:04.794 --> 1:06:05.629
- Preston.

1:06:12.602 --> 1:06:15.605
- Stay with me, Son.
Stay with me, Son.

1:06:15.605 --> 1:06:17.507
- I, I can't.

1:06:25.615 --> 1:06:26.450
- Wade!

1:06:33.957 --> 1:06:35.492
- Whoo.

1:06:35.492 --> 1:06:36.393
Whoo, whoo!

1:06:38.862 --> 1:06:39.929
- General, come on.

1:06:45.669 --> 1:06:47.604
- Get him up on the table, boys.

1:06:57.547 --> 1:06:58.615
Take that hat.

1:07:05.755 --> 1:07:06.590
- Turn him over.

1:07:10.560 --> 1:07:11.595
- All right, lay him up.

1:07:17.267 --> 1:07:19.103
Let me get in here.

1:07:19.103 --> 1:07:20.337
Oh, God.

1:07:20.337 --> 1:07:21.871
- We gotta get him
up on this side here.

1:07:21.871 --> 1:07:22.672
- Turn him over.

1:07:44.728 --> 1:07:45.662
- This is bad.

1:07:47.097 --> 1:07:49.599
It's not bleeding much. It
coulda been a lot worse.

1:07:58.375 --> 1:07:59.643
- Were you hit too, General?

1:07:59.643 --> 1:08:01.778
- I was not, but take
care of my boy Wade.

1:08:01.778 --> 1:08:02.746
- You sure you're okay?

1:08:02.746 --> 1:08:04.248
- I'm absolutely sure, ma'am.

1:08:05.915 --> 1:08:08.652
I gotta get back. My other
son's on the battlefield.

1:08:08.652 --> 1:08:10.354
He died, and I have
to get back to him.

1:08:10.354 --> 1:08:13.223
- We can patch him up for you.

1:08:13.223 --> 1:08:15.725
It will hurt, but we have
a little laudanum left.

1:08:15.725 --> 1:08:16.660
He should pull through.

1:08:16.660 --> 1:08:18.895
- Thank you, thank you so much.

1:08:26.002 --> 1:08:28.972
My dearest Mary.

1:08:28.972 --> 1:08:33.910
As I sit on the coast
of South Carolina,

1:08:33.910 --> 1:08:38.215
looking out into all
of God's wondrous ways,

1:08:39.616 --> 1:08:41.685
I take time to reflect.

1:08:42.819 --> 1:08:47.357
The war is really not
going well for us.

1:08:47.357 --> 1:08:49.993
I'm okay. The men are fine.

1:08:51.195 --> 1:08:53.430
But, Mary, I have
some tragic news.

1:08:54.398 --> 1:08:58.935
Our son Preston, our son Preston

1:08:58.935 --> 1:09:01.171
was killed on a
battlefield today.

1:09:02.572 --> 1:09:07.110
And Wade fell over Preston
to try to protect him

1:09:08.445 --> 1:09:10.614
and was shot and
wounded in the back.

1:09:11.748 --> 1:09:15.952
Now, Wade the
Fourth will be fine.

1:09:15.952 --> 1:09:17.754
The doctors have told me that.

1:09:18.888 --> 1:09:21.825
But he couldn't save Preston,

1:09:21.825 --> 1:09:24.628
and he was shot down
right in front of me.

1:09:25.995 --> 1:09:29.699
And it hurt me more than
it did when Frank died.

1:09:31.368 --> 1:09:33.937
I mean, this was my son.

1:09:35.171 --> 1:09:37.907
And, Mary, he'll
never come back again.

1:09:40.944 --> 1:09:42.912
Say a prayer for him in church.

1:09:44.748 --> 1:09:47.384
I wish you were here, Mary.

1:09:51.455 --> 1:09:53.257
Give my love to the girls.

1:09:54.324 --> 1:09:56.092
There will be brighter days.

1:09:57.394 --> 1:09:58.495
I'm sure of it.

1:09:59.763 --> 1:10:02.866
All the best, and
I love you, Wade.

1:10:16.980 --> 1:10:17.881
- General Hampton.

1:10:19.849 --> 1:10:20.684
- Yes?

1:10:21.951 --> 1:10:24.153
- I heard about the
loss of your son.

1:10:25.589 --> 1:10:28.224
Please accept my deepest
sympathy and condolences.

1:10:29.526 --> 1:10:33.062
Is there anything that
I can do to help you?

1:10:33.062 --> 1:10:36.833
- When this started, how long
did you think this would last?

1:10:36.833 --> 1:10:39.235
- What, this engagement
at Burgess Mill?

1:10:39.235 --> 1:10:43.239
- No, sir, I mean
the war itself.

1:10:44.173 --> 1:10:44.974
,

1:10:46.843 --> 1:10:50.046
after talking with a
lotta people at the start,

1:10:50.046 --> 1:10:54.183
we thought it might
last up to a year maybe.

1:10:54.183 --> 1:10:55.919
- I believe you're correct.

1:10:55.919 --> 1:10:57.987
I just keep thinking.

1:10:57.987 --> 1:11:01.958
If the war would have
lasted a year, maybe two,

1:11:01.958 --> 1:11:03.693
Preston would still be with me.

1:11:07.263 --> 1:11:08.998
- Have you thought
anything about going home

1:11:08.998 --> 1:11:10.334
for Christmas this year?

1:11:11.735 --> 1:11:13.603
- I haven't given
much thought to it.

1:11:14.838 --> 1:11:16.406
It's not even November yet.

1:11:17.607 --> 1:11:19.609
- I think it might
be a good idea

1:11:19.609 --> 1:11:23.913
to consider going home and
spending time with your family.

1:11:28.818 --> 1:11:30.454
- Is that an order, sir?

1:11:30.454 --> 1:11:34.057
- Wade, it's not an
order, not at all.

1:11:34.057 --> 1:11:37.126
It's just a suggestion
from one old friend,

1:11:37.126 --> 1:11:39.763
who's concerned, to another.

1:11:41.365 --> 1:11:43.166
- I think it's a good idea.

1:12:08.925 --> 1:12:11.327
- Wade, you haven't
eaten any of your dinner.

1:12:12.396 --> 1:12:14.598
- I'm not really
hungry, Mary, thank you.

1:12:16.199 --> 1:12:18.802
- And you, Son, you've
hardly eaten anything at all.

1:12:19.903 --> 1:12:21.705
- I'm just not
hungry yet, Mother.

1:12:21.705 --> 1:12:24.007
You're not hungry
for Christmas dinner?

1:12:26.175 --> 1:12:28.211
- I'm sorry, Mother.

1:12:28.211 --> 1:12:32.081
I guess, I guess I'm
just missing Preston.

1:12:32.081 --> 1:12:35.018
- It's all right,
Wade, we all are.

1:12:35.018 --> 1:12:36.319
- Well, the good news is,
there's been a shipment

1:12:36.319 --> 1:12:38.622
of toys that have
arrived in the village.

1:12:38.622 --> 1:12:42.291
You can go and pass those out
to the children this evening.

1:12:42.291 --> 1:12:44.928
- Wade, would you
handle that for me?

1:12:44.928 --> 1:12:46.162
- Sure.

1:12:46.162 --> 1:12:49.365
- No, absolutely not.
It needs to be you.

1:12:49.365 --> 1:12:50.767
It's tradition.

1:12:50.767 --> 1:12:52.268
Besides, there's
someone in the village

1:12:52.268 --> 1:12:53.770
that's been asking for you.

1:12:53.770 --> 1:12:54.604
- Who?

1:12:54.604 --> 1:12:56.072
- Nathaniel.

1:12:56.072 --> 1:12:58.341
He's in very poor health,
and they don't think

1:12:58.341 --> 1:13:00.577
he's going to make
another Christmas.

1:13:01.845 --> 1:13:03.847
- I don't, I don't know.

1:13:30.306 --> 1:13:32.809
All right, let's go make
some children happy,

1:13:32.809 --> 1:13:34.544
and then I'll go see Nathaniel.

1:13:51.661 --> 1:13:53.329
- Good evening, sir.

1:13:54.263 --> 1:13:55.699
- Good to see you, Nathaniel.

1:13:55.699 --> 1:13:57.801
I understand you're
not feeling too well.

1:13:58.868 --> 1:13:59.669
- Yes, sir.

1:14:00.837 --> 1:14:04.173
I believe my time
is coming to an end.

1:14:07.644 --> 1:14:08.945
- What can I do for you?

1:14:10.780 --> 1:14:13.116
- Just wanna thank you, sir.

1:14:14.784 --> 1:14:16.052
- Whatever for?

1:14:17.954 --> 1:14:21.691
- I was told you
gave all the children

1:14:22.926 --> 1:14:24.393
something for Christmas.

1:14:25.795 --> 1:14:28.431
- Of course, we been doing
that for a long while.

1:14:30.900 --> 1:14:33.803
- That was very
good of you, sir.

1:14:35.338 --> 1:14:37.206
Do you remember

1:14:38.174 --> 1:14:39.543
the promise?

1:14:39.543 --> 1:14:41.811
- Promise? What
promise would that be?

1:14:42.712 --> 1:14:43.880
- An old promise.

1:14:48.885 --> 1:14:51.054
You was just a little boy.

1:14:54.758 --> 1:14:57.761
- I believe I
remember that promise.

1:14:59.763 --> 1:15:00.630
- Maybe 40,

1:15:03.266 --> 1:15:04.333
50 years ago.

1:15:06.002 --> 1:15:07.904
- I believe I promised
you that I'd treat

1:15:07.904 --> 1:15:09.739
your people better
than my daddy did.

1:15:10.907 --> 1:15:14.010
- That's right. You
kept that promise.

1:15:15.511 --> 1:15:17.413
- Do you know why I
kept that promise?

1:15:19.082 --> 1:15:19.949
- Why, sir?

1:15:21.317 --> 1:15:24.287
- Because, considering
it's the right thing to do,

1:15:24.287 --> 1:15:27.290
I've always considered
you my friend.

1:15:31.427 --> 1:15:32.796
Goodbye, my friend.
