04:54.800 --> 04:58.003
<i> In the beginning was the Word,</i>

04:58.136 --> 05:01.588
<i>and the Word was with God,</i>

05:01.723 --> 05:05.306
<i>and the Word was God.</i>

05:05.435 --> 05:07.475
<i> I am He.</i>

05:12.984 --> 05:16.234
<i>He was in the beginning with God,.</i>

05:16.363 --> 05:20.028
<i>All things were made through him,</i>

05:20.158 --> 05:25.034
<i>and without him was made nothing</i>
<i>that has been made.</i>

05:29.042 --> 05:31.829
<i>In him was life,</i>

05:33.004 --> 05:35.626
<i>and the life was the light of men.</i>

05:39.719 --> 05:43.931
<i>And the light shines on in the darkness,</i>

05:48.895 --> 05:52.229
<i>and the darkness grasped it not.</i>

06:09.875 --> 06:13.290
<i>The greatest story ever told.</i>

07:36.127 --> 07:39.543
You have been asking
questions about a child.

07:40.132 --> 07:44.924
We have, Your Majesty. We've come
a great distance in search of him.

07:45.053 --> 07:49.265
And who told you about
such a child who is to be born a king

07:49.391 --> 07:51.265
in my kingdom?

07:51.393 --> 07:56.351
We saw the rising of his star,
and his star has been our guide.

07:57.440 --> 08:00.311
You have followed a star

08:00.443 --> 08:03.528
from Asia to the centre of the world?

08:06.032 --> 08:07.859
Aben?

08:08.702 --> 08:11.275
Do you know of
this child king they look for?

08:11.413 --> 08:14.164
In prophecy there is
mention made of a Messiah.

08:14.291 --> 08:17.327
And where is this Messiah to be born?

08:17.460 --> 08:20.378
The prophet Hosea named
Egypt as the place of birth.

08:20.505 --> 08:22.545
The great Isaiah spoke of Nazareth.

08:22.674 --> 08:25.461
That was 700 years ago.

08:25.594 --> 08:30.220
Your Majesty, if I may be so bold,
the prophet Michaeus named Bethlehem.

08:32.476 --> 08:35.145
I remember.

08:35.270 --> 08:37.227
"From you, Bethlehem,

08:37.355 --> 08:42.515
shall he come forth
who is to be ruler in all Israel."

08:48.909 --> 08:53.903
I am an Idumean, not a Judean.

08:54.039 --> 08:58.499
The priests here in Judea
mock me in their temple.

08:58.627 --> 09:00.915
The temple which I built.

09:01.046 --> 09:05.589
They accuse me of impiety.
Tell them, Antipas.

09:06.134 --> 09:08.886
The priests are envious of my father.

09:09.012 --> 09:12.013
He knows the prophets better,
and has more faith in them.

09:12.140 --> 09:15.011
Everyone knows that I am a pious man.

09:16.770 --> 09:20.602
Magi, when you find this child,

09:20.732 --> 09:23.686
how can you be certain
that he is the one?

09:23.819 --> 09:27.519
By the accuracy of the stars.

09:27.656 --> 09:29.483
Yes.

09:32.077 --> 09:37.154
Then it is only by the star
that you can know.

09:37.290 --> 09:41.584
What greater spokesman
can a child have than a star?

09:41.711 --> 09:45.579
The air is cold. Your Majesty should rest.

09:45.715 --> 09:50.923
If great Herod will give us leave,
we should be on our way.

09:51.054 --> 09:53.213
Go then.

09:53.348 --> 09:56.551
If you find this child, bring me word,

09:56.685 --> 09:59.140
that I, too, might worship him.

10:12.200 --> 10:14.987
Follow them and keep me informed.

11:33.281 --> 11:35.321
<i> He shall be great...</i>

11:37.077 --> 11:39.864
<i>and called the Son of the Most High.</i>

11:41.957 --> 11:46.085
<i>And the Lord God will give him</i>
<i>the throne of his ancestor, David.</i>

11:48.296 --> 11:51.083
<i>And his kingdom shall know no end.</i>

12:08.608 --> 12:10.518
Who are you?

12:10.652 --> 12:14.235
We have come from
a far land to see your child.

12:17.325 --> 12:19.781
What will you name him?

12:21.538 --> 12:23.365
Jesus.

12:25.333 --> 12:27.789
Jesus will be his name.

12:33.508 --> 12:36.213
I bring gold,

12:36.344 --> 12:38.882
for the sovereignty of our king.

12:42.559 --> 12:44.598
And frankincense,

12:46.188 --> 12:48.643
for the worship of God.

12:53.904 --> 12:59.906
And myrrh,
for preservation until time everlasting.

13:21.807 --> 13:23.883
The old king.

13:24.976 --> 13:27.016
We leave at once.

13:46.581 --> 13:50.081
<i> Take the child. Flee.</i>

13:51.586 --> 13:57.007
The stars foretold
that one day I would be king.

13:59.052 --> 14:01.804
- And I am king.
- Truly.

14:01.930 --> 14:06.343
If there is anything in prophecy, surely
it is not the stars, but God who has sent...

14:06.476 --> 14:09.181
Huh! God! Where is God?

14:11.314 --> 14:13.722
Or the child of God,

14:13.859 --> 14:17.109
except in man's
most dangerous imagination?

14:20.365 --> 14:25.525
The child of imagination is the child I fear.

14:26.621 --> 14:30.785
And, my son, when you reign -

14:30.917 --> 14:35.129
if you do - remember that.

14:46.975 --> 14:49.015
- Well?
- Sire.

14:50.312 --> 14:53.313
We followed them.
They went to Bethlehem.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.516
Bethlehem.

14:55.650 --> 14:57.939
In fulfilment of your prophecy.

14:58.069 --> 15:03.490
Prophecies have been scattered through
history like seed. You can disregard this.

15:03.617 --> 15:07.745
Or find one more fitting.

15:09.372 --> 15:11.661
As I remember

15:11.791 --> 15:15.207
"A voice was heard in Bethlehem,

15:15.337 --> 15:18.207
weeping and mourning."

15:18.340 --> 15:22.587
"A voice was heard in Ramah."
Bethlehem...

15:22.719 --> 15:26.254
"There was weeping
and great mourning."

15:26.389 --> 15:31.016
"It was Rachel, weeping for her children,

15:31.144 --> 15:34.098
because they were no more."

15:36.316 --> 15:39.400
Let this be the prophecy fulfilled.

15:40.821 --> 15:45.032
Go to Bethlehem and kill this child.

15:45.158 --> 15:51.031
To be sure, every newborn boy
in Bethlehem must die.

15:51.164 --> 15:54.118
Be certain that none escape.

15:56.169 --> 15:58.541
You have a question?

15:58.672 --> 16:00.711
Then go!

17:02.152 --> 17:04.394
Sire.

17:04.529 --> 17:06.984
Not one is alive.

18:05.215 --> 18:09.213
"For unto us a child is born,

18:10.595 --> 18:13.051
unto us a son is given;

18:14.808 --> 18:17.725
and his name shall be called Wonderful,

18:19.020 --> 18:21.808
Everlasting Father,

18:21.940 --> 18:24.063
the Prince of Peace."

18:27.028 --> 18:30.029
King Herod is dead!

18:30.157 --> 18:32.944
King Herod is dead at last!

18:40.667 --> 18:44.166
These travellers have just
brought the news from Jerusalem.

18:44.296 --> 18:46.335
Herod is dead!

18:54.681 --> 18:56.590
Home.

18:56.725 --> 18:58.552
Nazareth.

19:09.779 --> 19:14.406
The old Herod is dead.
Death to the new one. Long live Israel!

19:28.465 --> 19:30.541
How far is the nearest Roman legion?

19:30.675 --> 19:33.511
Three days' march, sire. In Syria.

19:33.637 --> 19:37.302
Send a messenger there,
to the Roman governor.

19:37.432 --> 19:39.970
Inform him...

19:40.685 --> 19:45.810
inform him that the eagle of Rome
has been torn down and desecrated

19:45.941 --> 19:48.396
by a Jerusalem mob.

20:25.063 --> 20:28.147
Send us the Deliverer, the Messiah.

20:29.568 --> 20:32.237
Send us the Promised One.

20:45.292 --> 20:49.420
Let these men be an example
to all who challenge the peace of Rome.

20:56.761 --> 21:00.380
I will call upon the Lord,
who is worthy to be praised,

21:00.515 --> 21:04.098
and so shall I be saved
from mine enemies.

21:04.227 --> 21:06.683
He shall judge thy people
with righteousness,

21:06.813 --> 21:08.853
and thy poor with judgment.

21:08.982 --> 21:11.651
The mountains shall
bring peace to the people,

21:11.776 --> 21:13.235
and the little hills...

21:13.361 --> 21:15.769
Greetings, in the name
of Augustus Caesar.

21:15.906 --> 21:20.568
Caesar will not regret what he has done
for the son of his old friend, King Herod.

21:20.744 --> 21:24.029
What is that?

21:24.164 --> 21:28.660
In time of trouble, the people pray
for one to save them, a deliverer.

21:28.793 --> 21:31.285
Your father kept the people in order.

21:31.421 --> 21:36.130
In this <i>you</i> have failed.
I must inform you that we will take over.

21:37.427 --> 21:40.132
My father's kingdom
was guaranteed by Caesar.

21:40.263 --> 21:45.424
From now on, a Roman legion, directed
by a Roman governor, will govern Judea.

21:56.321 --> 21:59.275
- You are the High Priest?
- As you see.

21:59.407 --> 22:02.823
Shemiah, in the vestments
of the High Priest.

22:03.370 --> 22:06.821
From now on, those vestments
will stay in my headquarters,

22:06.957 --> 22:10.539
and those who defy us
will not be allowed to wear them.

22:11.586 --> 22:15.501
Hear my cry, O God,
attend unto my prayer;

22:15.632 --> 22:19.712
from the end of the earth
will I cry unto thee.

22:19.845 --> 22:23.260
Lead me to the rock that is higher than l;

22:23.390 --> 22:28.977
for thou hast been a shelter for me,
and a strong tower from the enemy.

23:02.387 --> 23:05.471
<i>I wait for the Lord, my soul doth wait,</i>

23:06.516 --> 23:09.138
<i>and in his word do I hope.</i>

23:10.645 --> 23:15.106
<i>My God, my God,</i>
<i>why hast thou forsaken me?</i>

23:15.233 --> 23:18.602
<i>Why are thou so far from helping me?</i>

23:18.737 --> 23:23.066
<i>O my God, I cry in the daytime,</i>
<i>but thou hearest not,.</i>

23:23.200 --> 23:26.948
<i>And in the night season,</i>
<i>and am not silent.</i>

23:29.247 --> 23:33.874
<i>Our fathers trusted in thee,.</i>
<i>They trusted, and thou didst deliver them.</i>

23:35.462 --> 23:39.210
<i>They cried unto thee, and were delivered,.</i>

23:39.341 --> 23:42.923
<i>They trusted in thee,</i>
<i>and were not confounded.</i>

23:44.679 --> 23:47.883
<i>In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust,.</i>

23:48.016 --> 23:51.432
<i>Deliver me in they righteousness.</i>

23:51.561 --> 23:56.354
Judge me, O God, and plead
my cause against the ungodly nation;

23:56.483 --> 24:00.066
O deliver me from
the deceitful and unjust men.

24:01.071 --> 24:02.898
For thou art the God of my strength.

24:03.031 --> 24:07.776
Tomorrow a Roman escort will see you
across the Jordan to your father's palace.

24:08.954 --> 24:12.323
Jordan and Galilee will be your tetrarchy.

24:12.457 --> 24:15.494
O send out thy light and thy truth;

24:15.627 --> 24:18.414
let them lead me.

24:18.547 --> 24:22.295
Send to us the Messiah,
the Promised One,

24:22.425 --> 24:25.130
the Son of David.

24:25.262 --> 24:27.468
Who is the Messiah they cry for?

24:28.890 --> 24:32.140
Someone who will never come.

24:33.270 --> 24:36.105
All nations shall call him blessed.

24:36.231 --> 24:39.066
His name shall endure for ever.

24:39.401 --> 24:42.106
<i>His name shall endure for ever.</i>

25:14.644 --> 25:19.639
<i> Send to us the Deliverer,</i>
<i>the Promised One, the Messiah.</i>

25:19.774 --> 25:23.642
You're wasting your time.
If he were coming, he'd be here by now.

26:28.510 --> 26:30.668
<i> Repent!</i>

26:30.804 --> 26:33.259
<i>I desire steadfast love,</i>

26:34.808 --> 26:37.513
<i>and not sacrifice.</i>

26:37.644 --> 26:40.182
<i>A knowledge of God,</i>

26:40.313 --> 26:43.184
<i>and not burnt offerings.</i>

26:44.359 --> 26:47.146
<i>Repent! Repent!</i>

26:49.489 --> 26:51.778
<i>Come near,</i>

26:51.908 --> 26:56.036
<i>and listen to the voice of one</i>
<i>crying in the wilderness.</i>

26:57.706 --> 27:00.031
<i>Every valley shall be filled,</i>

27:00.167 --> 27:03.749
<i>and every mountain and hill</i>
<i>shall be brought low,</i>

27:04.629 --> 27:07.334
<i>and the rough way smooth.</i>

27:08.675 --> 27:14.879
<i>And all flesh shall see</i>
<i>the salvation of God.</i>

27:17.309 --> 27:20.642
<i>Prepare ye the way of the Lord,</i>

27:22.147 --> 27:27.983
<i>and make straight in the desert</i>
<i>a highway for our God.</i>

27:31.198 --> 27:33.024
<i>Behold,</i>

27:34.201 --> 27:37.700
<i>I send my messenger</i>

27:37.829 --> 27:40.534
<i>who shall prepare the way.</i>

27:42.292 --> 27:45.044
<i>Let the earth hear,</i>

27:45.170 --> 27:48.005
<i>and all that is in it</i>

27:48.131 --> 27:51.714
<i>and all things that come from it.</i>

27:56.848 --> 27:59.304
<i>Repent!</i>

27:59.434 --> 28:01.723
Come near

28:01.853 --> 28:05.981
and listen to the voice of one
crying in the wilderness.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.559
Repent!

28:09.694 --> 28:13.478
The anger of the Lord is upon all nations.

28:14.366 --> 28:16.654
Repent.

28:16.785 --> 28:22.289
There is one coming who will baptise
with fire and with the Holy Spirit.

28:31.383 --> 28:35.511
One whose coming has been of old,
from time everlasting,

28:36.179 --> 28:38.386
is soon to be among us.

28:40.308 --> 28:43.428
Greater than all of us.

28:43.562 --> 28:48.520
One whose sandals
I am not worthy to carry.

28:54.156 --> 28:56.195
Who are you?

28:56.950 --> 28:58.990
I do not know you,

29:00.912 --> 29:03.368
yet I know you.

29:05.375 --> 29:07.948
Baptise me, John.

29:10.922 --> 29:13.294
What is your name?

29:13.425 --> 29:15.548
Jesus.

29:15.677 --> 29:18.049
Where born?

29:18.180 --> 29:20.006
Bethlehem.

29:22.559 --> 29:25.476
Is it not you who should baptise me?

29:27.898 --> 29:30.602
Why do you ask me this?

29:30.734 --> 29:33.141
In the scriptures it is written

29:33.278 --> 29:36.195
"From you, Bethlehem,
shall he come forth

29:36.323 --> 29:39.407
who is to be ruler in all Israel,

29:39.534 --> 29:43.449
whose coming has been of old,
from time everlasting."

30:08.605 --> 30:11.013
You are he.

30:11.149 --> 30:13.687
The one we have been waiting for.

30:15.028 --> 30:19.240
The world is waiting.
It sleeps, waiting to waken.

30:20.450 --> 30:22.573
I will come back.

30:47.936 --> 30:50.094
Lift up your heads,

30:50.230 --> 30:52.982
O you gates!

30:53.108 --> 30:55.978
And the King of Glory shall come in.

30:57.696 --> 31:00.862
<i>Get thee up into the high mountains.</i>

31:00.991 --> 31:04.027
<i>Lift up thy voice with strength.</i>

31:04.161 --> 31:06.200
<i>Lift it up!</i>

31:07.414 --> 31:10.368
<i>Let all the nations be gathered together.</i>

31:12.127 --> 31:16.421
<i>Say unto them "Behold your God!"</i>

31:18.842 --> 31:22.590
<i>The Lord God will come</i>
<i>with a strong hand.</i>

31:23.972 --> 31:27.388
<i>His arm shall rule for him.</i>

31:30.103 --> 31:35.690
<i>Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God.</i>

31:37.527 --> 31:41.145
<i>Ask it either in the depth,</i>

31:41.281 --> 31:43.737
<i>or in the height above!</i>

32:09.059 --> 32:12.013
A long, hard climb, wasn't it?

32:14.689 --> 32:17.311
Come on in, if you like.

32:22.739 --> 32:26.653
Some think the whole of life
should be hard like that.

32:28.161 --> 32:32.289
An easy life is a sinful life.

32:34.584 --> 32:37.419
That's what they think.

32:38.421 --> 32:40.628
Not so.

32:40.757 --> 32:43.379
Life should be as easy
as a man can make it.

32:44.219 --> 32:47.006
And it can be easy, friend,

32:47.139 --> 32:51.053
if a man knows the way
to power and glory in this world.

32:59.276 --> 33:02.360
Here. You must be hungry
after your long climb.

33:05.448 --> 33:08.533
- Have some.
- I'm fasting.

33:08.660 --> 33:11.198
A man has to keep his strength up. Go on.

33:14.124 --> 33:16.662
Are you sure you won't have a little?

33:58.418 --> 34:01.502
How would you like to be
the ruler of all of this?

34:03.590 --> 34:05.417
Hm?

34:06.510 --> 34:09.594
All of the power and the glory
of these kingdoms?

34:13.141 --> 34:15.597
I can give them to you.

34:18.355 --> 34:22.649
If you do me homage, it will all be yours.

34:28.697 --> 34:32.826
"Thou shalt do homage
to the Lord thy God,

34:34.246 --> 34:36.284
and serve him only."

34:37.290 --> 34:39.330
It is written

34:40.543 --> 34:44.244
"He shall put his angels in charge,

34:44.380 --> 34:46.835
to keep thee from harm."

34:47.842 --> 34:51.092
"And they shall hold up their hands

34:51.221 --> 34:54.092
lest you dash your foot against a stone."

35:13.535 --> 35:15.990
If you are the Son of God,

35:17.080 --> 35:19.618
throw yourself down from here.

35:40.979 --> 35:44.229
"Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God."

36:00.332 --> 36:02.787
If you're the Son of God,

36:03.919 --> 36:07.003
command that
these stones be made bread.

36:11.635 --> 36:17.305
It is written that a man
shall not live by bread alone,

36:20.727 --> 36:25.270
but by every word that proceedeth
out of the mouth of God.

36:41.790 --> 36:44.577
<i> It is but a little while</i>

36:44.709 --> 36:49.087
<i>all the earth shall be</i>
<i>turned into a fruitful field.</i>

36:51.091 --> 36:55.634
<i>The eyes of the blind</i>
<i>shall see out of darkness.</i>

36:59.724 --> 37:02.678
<i>The meek also shall joy in the Lord,</i>

37:03.478 --> 37:06.563
<i>and the poor among men rejoice.</i>

37:09.359 --> 37:12.942
<i>For the needy</i>
<i>shall not always be forgotten.</i>

37:14.197 --> 37:18.325
<i>Their expectations</i>
<i>shall not perish for ever.</i>

37:19.911 --> 37:22.698
<i>Arise. Shine!</i>

37:23.790 --> 37:26.412
<i>For thy light is come,</i>

37:26.543 --> 37:31.335
<i>and the glory of the Lord</i>
<i>is risen upon thee!</i>

38:13.465 --> 38:16.170
<i> All the tribes of the earth</i>

38:17.093 --> 38:21.471
<i>shall see the Son of Man</i>
<i>coming in the cloud of heaven...</i>

38:22.766 --> 38:26.680
<i>with power and great glory.</i>

38:44.663 --> 38:46.490
Baptist!

38:46.623 --> 38:50.751
You are ordered to stop,
in the name of the Grand Sanhedrin.

38:56.633 --> 38:58.673
This is no heresy.

38:59.094 --> 39:01.133
I speak the Word of God.

39:01.721 --> 39:05.304
- You should come here to repent.
- Careful, friend.

39:08.603 --> 39:11.474
They are the ones that do
Caesar's bloody work for him.

39:11.606 --> 39:15.521
- There has been enough of this.
- There's nothing here for you.

39:18.155 --> 39:21.654
You insult the decent sinners
who come here to repent.

39:21.783 --> 39:25.069
This is treasonous, and it will be reported.

39:25.579 --> 39:27.618
Report it well.

39:31.209 --> 39:36.167
You sit in our holy temple now
and condemn the Romans...

39:39.468 --> 39:42.137
but you serve them.

39:42.471 --> 39:44.297
Hypocrites!

39:59.154 --> 40:01.906
This is our shepherd. The one who...

40:02.032 --> 40:06.777
Those that are mine will know me.
And if they follow me, I will know them.

40:09.080 --> 40:11.536
I am going back to Galilee.

40:26.056 --> 40:28.095
Shepherd?

40:29.518 --> 40:32.637
My name is Judas Iscariot.

40:33.188 --> 40:35.893
Jesus, from Nazareth.

40:36.024 --> 40:38.230
Rabbi?

40:38.360 --> 40:40.602
Rabbi, I'm from Galilee.

40:40.737 --> 40:43.940
We're fishermen... from the lake.

40:44.074 --> 40:46.647
I am Andrew.

40:46.785 --> 40:49.323
My brother, Peter. And this is...

40:49.454 --> 40:52.823
- John.
- We would like to go with you.

40:52.958 --> 40:54.867
Come with me.

40:55.794 --> 40:58.249
I will make you fishers of men.

41:20.902 --> 41:23.144
Let us pass!

41:32.789 --> 41:35.660
Do not labour for the food that perishes,

41:37.919 --> 41:41.122
but for that which endures -

41:41.256 --> 41:43.877
the food of eternal life.

41:46.386 --> 41:50.004
For the bread of God
is that which comes from heaven

41:50.140 --> 41:52.595
and gives life to the world.

41:54.436 --> 41:58.979
And everyone who eats
of this bread will live for ever.

42:03.820 --> 42:08.447
Therefore, put away all anxious thoughts
about food to keep you alive,

42:09.910 --> 42:12.365
clothes to cover your body.

42:14.080 --> 42:18.292
Life is more than food,
and the body more than clothing.

42:26.218 --> 42:28.709
Think of the ravens.

42:29.805 --> 42:32.675
They neither sow nor reap.

42:34.518 --> 42:37.056
They have no storehouse nor barn.

42:39.981 --> 42:42.270
Yet God feeds them.

42:45.028 --> 42:48.860
And how much more
are you worth than birds?

42:51.618 --> 42:54.239
Is there a man among you

42:55.330 --> 42:59.197
who by worry can add
one minute to his span of life?

43:03.630 --> 43:06.417
If you cannot do so small a thing,

43:06.883 --> 43:09.754
why do you worry
about your other needs?

43:20.105 --> 43:22.560
O you men of little faith.

43:31.491 --> 43:34.576
Do not set your heart
on what you eat or drink.

43:35.912 --> 43:39.495
These are things that all
the others in the world run after.

43:40.876 --> 43:44.660
You have a Father
who knows that you need them.

43:47.215 --> 43:49.753
Set your mind upon his kingdom,

43:50.844 --> 43:53.880
and all of these things shall be yours,

43:55.265 --> 43:57.092
without the asking.

44:10.822 --> 44:14.820
Tell us, when will
the Kingdom of God come?

44:18.788 --> 44:21.244
The Kingdom of God is here,

44:22.876 --> 44:24.915
within you.

44:53.907 --> 44:56.659
A thief has stolen my coat.

44:57.494 --> 44:59.617
Is that all, Peter?

44:59.746 --> 45:02.782
Is that all?! It was the only coat I had.

45:03.875 --> 45:07.790
But of what value is a thing
which can be stolen by a thief?

45:09.089 --> 45:13.834
Go and find that thief.
Give him your cloak also.

45:13.969 --> 45:17.634
And give him anything else he wishes
within your power to give him,

45:17.764 --> 45:21.263
for he is poor in spirit, and in need.

45:23.937 --> 45:28.065
But if everyone did what you say,
thieves would soon take over the world.

45:29.067 --> 45:32.317
Thieves and murderers walk in darkness.

45:32.445 --> 45:36.028
You must be their light, Peter,
not their judge.

45:40.787 --> 45:44.037
All I'm saying is,
someone has taken my coat.

45:45.333 --> 45:48.085
I think he was wrong to take it.

45:48.211 --> 45:51.165
All <i>I'm</i> saying, Peter,

45:51.298 --> 45:55.675
is that as you have been judging,
you will be judged.

45:56.678 --> 45:59.465
And with your measure,
it will be measured to you.

46:04.936 --> 46:07.392
It was the best coat I ever owned.

46:08.982 --> 46:11.520
Be not troubled about your coat.

46:16.281 --> 46:19.365
See the lilies of the field, how they grow.

46:20.785 --> 46:23.241
They neither toil nor spin,

46:24.539 --> 46:29.497
but even Solomon, in all his glory,
was never arrayed like one of these.

46:31.546 --> 46:34.002
But how am I to keep warm?

46:55.028 --> 46:57.484
Our work will start in Galilee.

47:25.684 --> 47:28.934
I saw him last night.
He was just behind us.

47:29.062 --> 47:31.933
Why do you follow us?

47:32.065 --> 47:34.603
I heard what he said last night.

47:35.569 --> 47:37.608
I liked it.

47:39.990 --> 47:44.070
If he's going to say anything else,
I want to hear it.

47:45.996 --> 47:48.035
Come.

47:48.165 --> 47:50.204
Walk with me.

47:58.884 --> 48:00.378
Sir?

48:00.510 --> 48:04.425
Is what you say just for us,
or is it for everyone?

48:05.974 --> 48:10.102
- What is your name, my friend?
- James. Little James.

48:10.645 --> 48:13.895
They call me "Little"
because I am the youngest.

48:14.024 --> 48:16.811
- What is your name?
- Jesus.

48:18.111 --> 48:20.649
Ah, that's a good name.

48:23.033 --> 48:25.072
Thank you.

48:42.052 --> 48:45.752
Lord Caiaphas, I have
a report from the River Jordan.

48:45.889 --> 48:48.594
Yesterday this John the Baptist
spoke blasphemy.

48:48.725 --> 48:51.512
He said "Let the powers tremble."

48:51.645 --> 48:55.808
- Who is this person, the baptist?
- John. He preaches revolution.

48:55.941 --> 48:58.182
- Against the Romans?
- All authority.

48:58.318 --> 49:01.236
"One is coming who is greater than I."

49:01.738 --> 49:03.980
What?

49:04.115 --> 49:07.366
It is written "The Messiah
will come to the city of God."

49:07.494 --> 49:09.866
Hup!

49:13.083 --> 49:15.870
Governor Pilate will see the High Priest.

49:16.002 --> 49:20.332
- Concerning what?
- Governor Pilate will tell you.

49:20.465 --> 49:22.505
I see.

49:36.940 --> 49:39.645
What a mighty fortress.

49:41.444 --> 49:45.027
She that was great among nations
has lost her glory.

49:46.700 --> 49:49.238
Now she stretches out her hand.

49:51.955 --> 49:54.493
There is no one to comfort her.

49:56.376 --> 49:58.832
There will come a time to enter.

50:02.382 --> 50:05.466
O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,

50:07.554 --> 50:10.127
the city that murders the prophets

50:10.265 --> 50:12.803
and stones those who are sent to her,

50:14.603 --> 50:17.141
how I long to gather your children.

50:19.649 --> 50:23.647
But you shall never see me
until the time when you say

50:25.030 --> 50:28.363
"Blessings on him who
comes in the name of the Lord."

50:29.409 --> 50:32.161
They are pilgrims.

50:32.287 --> 50:34.743
They must be hungry.

50:39.628 --> 50:41.869
Good friends.

50:43.715 --> 50:48.176
You are welcome to my house.
Come in for rest and food.

50:57.187 --> 50:59.014
Hup!

51:02.067 --> 51:03.442
Hail, Pilate.

51:03.568 --> 51:06.142
Rome won't tolerate it.

51:06.279 --> 51:09.066
I will not tolerate it.

51:09.199 --> 51:11.488
- Why do you?
- What, Governor Pilate?

51:11.618 --> 51:14.738
This man on the Jordan, John the Baptist.

51:14.871 --> 51:17.623
Why do the people listen,
give him encouragement?

51:17.749 --> 51:20.038
The man is in King Herod's territory.

51:20.168 --> 51:23.122
- Have you spoken of him to Herod?
- No.

51:23.463 --> 51:25.503
Why not?

51:25.632 --> 51:28.966
- We intended asking your permission.
- You have it.

51:31.388 --> 51:34.342
Wait. Another thing.

51:36.017 --> 51:40.181
I care nothing either for
your superstitions or your God.

51:40.814 --> 51:44.349
I'm here to keep order
in this desert land, and that I will do.

51:44.484 --> 51:48.399
I want to hear nothing more
about this troublemaker,

51:48.530 --> 51:50.985
or anyone like him.

51:57.330 --> 52:00.664
And what commandment
is first of all?

52:01.710 --> 52:07.499
Hear, O Israel,
the Lord our God is one lord.

52:07.632 --> 52:12.543
And thou shalt love the Lord thy God
with all thy heart and with all thy soul,

52:13.180 --> 52:16.264
and with all thy mind
and with all thy strength.

52:19.019 --> 52:21.474
And the second:

52:21.605 --> 52:24.475
Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.

52:25.901 --> 52:28.771
There is no greater commandment
than these.

52:30.322 --> 52:33.192
Well said. You said the truth.

52:34.910 --> 52:36.986
To love one's neighbour as oneself

52:37.120 --> 52:40.454
is more than all
the burnt offerings and sacrifices.

52:43.502 --> 52:47.120
I wish others could understand
the wisdom of what you say.

52:47.255 --> 52:49.829
They will. Won't they, Master?

52:49.966 --> 52:53.549
You're not far
from the Kingdom of God, Lazarus.

52:59.017 --> 53:01.259
Tell me,

53:01.394 --> 53:03.932
would it be possible
for me to go with you?

53:08.568 --> 53:10.608
You are wealthy.

53:11.696 --> 53:13.985
Yes, I am.

53:14.115 --> 53:16.689
Do you consider wealth a crime?

53:16.827 --> 53:19.662
Not at all.

53:19.788 --> 53:22.493
But it may become a burden.

53:23.708 --> 53:28.251
For what does it profit a man
to gain the whole world

53:29.339 --> 53:31.379
and lose his soul?

53:37.514 --> 53:41.428
Are you saying that a man
cannot have both money and a soul?

53:43.061 --> 53:49.265
I am saying that it is easier for a camel
to go through the eye of a needle

53:50.485 --> 53:53.819
than for a rich man
to enter the kingdom of heaven.

53:54.823 --> 53:58.073
My brother will go to heaven.
He is a good man.

53:59.661 --> 54:02.995
Did I say he was <i>not</i> good?
I said he is wealthy.

54:04.624 --> 54:07.874
Where a man's wealth is,
there is his heart also.

54:09.129 --> 54:13.625
A man cannot serve two masters.
You cannot serve both God and money.

54:13.758 --> 54:18.052
But I give my money to God.
I give a third of all I earn.

54:21.558 --> 54:26.184
I know a widow woman
who gave two pennies.

54:29.649 --> 54:32.105
What is two pennies?

54:34.279 --> 54:36.319
It was all she had.

54:40.285 --> 54:42.325
But I love God.

54:44.581 --> 54:47.997
Would you give up
all you own and follow me?

55:03.683 --> 55:06.139
Who could do such a thing?

55:28.458 --> 55:31.542
You and your friends
are welcome to stay the night.

55:32.838 --> 55:35.874
We have room enough and food enough.

55:36.007 --> 55:39.590
Lazarus, I will not forget you.

55:45.433 --> 55:47.473
Stay, please.

55:50.397 --> 55:52.140
We are grateful.

55:59.239 --> 56:02.987
- I am frightened for him.
- Why, Mary?

56:03.118 --> 56:05.573
He is too good.

56:14.671 --> 56:18.585
Sire, these emissaries
have come from Jerusalem

56:18.717 --> 56:21.753
with disturbing reports
of a fanatic preacher,

56:21.887 --> 56:27.225
a so-called baptist, who incites
great crowds on the Jordan river.

56:27.350 --> 56:31.644
- Why do you come to me?
- He stands day after day in the water,

56:31.771 --> 56:34.013
spreading sedition.

56:34.149 --> 56:38.194
Did it occur to you that as ruler, I have
more to do than chase an eccentric,

56:38.320 --> 56:41.653
screaming hell and damnation,
out of the Jordan river?

56:48.163 --> 56:51.496
I humbly suggest that
Your Majesty has not grasped

56:51.625 --> 56:55.753
the inflammatory possibilities
of this man's preaching.

56:55.879 --> 56:57.622
Impostor.

56:58.590 --> 57:01.377
All prophets are impostors.

57:01.510 --> 57:06.302
He is attracting great crowds
from all over Judea and Galilee,

57:06.431 --> 57:09.136
promising a better world to come.

57:09.267 --> 57:13.099
Good for him. We can use a better world.

57:13.230 --> 57:15.851
Preferably one without Romans.

57:15.982 --> 57:19.102
He speaks of the Christ that is to come.

57:22.531 --> 57:24.772
What did you say?

57:24.908 --> 57:27.944
The Christ, Your Majesty. A Messiah.

57:34.042 --> 57:36.498
Bring that baptist to me.

58:20.422 --> 58:22.960
I wish we could go in another way.

58:24.134 --> 58:26.755
Isn't one gate the same as another?

58:26.887 --> 58:28.595
No.

58:28.722 --> 58:32.636
In all the world there is only
one gate which has my brother in it.

58:35.270 --> 58:39.398
- Is your brother a beggar?
- I wish he were something that good.

58:40.859 --> 58:44.773
My brother is a tax collector.
God help me.

58:45.906 --> 58:50.449
A wicked man who collects taxes
for the Romans from his own people.

58:50.577 --> 58:52.902
From his own people.

58:53.038 --> 58:55.873
Look. There he is!

58:55.999 --> 58:58.537
Not one of our family speaks to him.

58:59.711 --> 59:02.332
Do you love him?

59:02.464 --> 59:07.803
He's wicked, I tell you. He drinks and
swears and gambles and collects taxes.

59:09.095 --> 59:11.765
Do you love him, James?

59:11.890 --> 59:14.013
Yes.

59:14.559 --> 59:17.050
Look, just ignore him as we go by.

59:17.187 --> 59:20.271
If we stop, he'll say something vulgar.

59:20.398 --> 59:22.854
- What is his name?
- Matthew.

59:30.826 --> 59:33.032
Brother James!

59:33.161 --> 59:36.281
What are you doing in Capernaum?
Looking for a woman?

59:36.414 --> 59:39.581
Have you anything to declare?

59:39.709 --> 59:42.247
Only myself and my Father.

59:49.219 --> 59:51.258
Where is your father?

59:51.388 --> 59:54.305
In my heart.

59:54.432 --> 59:57.350
Well, why are you hiding him from me?

59:57.477 --> 01:00:01.771
I am not hiding him.
He who sees the Son, sees the Father.

01:00:03.942 --> 01:00:06.729
Has <i>he</i> anything to declare?

01:00:06.862 --> 01:00:09.483
Yes. His love for you.

01:00:12.367 --> 01:00:14.407
Well, now, uh...

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:20.206
I can't very well tax that... can I?

01:00:22.169 --> 01:00:24.208
Follow me, Matthew.

01:00:33.388 --> 01:00:35.547
You want my money, or don't you?

01:00:37.559 --> 01:00:40.015
Oh, you made a bad mistake.

01:01:37.494 --> 01:01:40.115
The day of the Lord comes,

01:01:42.165 --> 01:01:47.326
cruel, with wrath and fierce anger,

01:01:48.588 --> 01:01:51.044
to make the earth a desolation.

01:01:52.175 --> 01:01:56.469
The Lord will punish the world for its evil,

01:01:56.596 --> 01:01:59.266
and the wicked for their iniquities.

01:01:59.391 --> 01:02:01.964
When we know a sinner,

01:02:02.102 --> 01:02:06.431
we must look upon him
with horror and drive him from us.

01:02:06.565 --> 01:02:08.391
No.

01:02:13.780 --> 01:02:16.947
A righteous man turns away from evil,

01:02:19.077 --> 01:02:22.528
for the way of the weak
may lead him astray.

01:02:22.664 --> 01:02:24.573
No.

01:02:24.708 --> 01:02:27.080
Who are you?

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:30.377
Jesus, of Nazareth.

01:02:33.717 --> 01:02:35.756
What do you wish to say?

01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:38.459
In the scriptures it is written

01:02:38.597 --> 01:02:42.179
"I desire mercy, not sacrifice."

01:02:43.643 --> 01:02:45.802
I would tell you,

01:02:45.937 --> 01:02:48.475
rebuke your brother who sins,

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:53.484
but if he repents, forgive him.

01:02:54.070 --> 01:02:57.771
What do you think
you are telling these good people?

01:02:57.908 --> 01:03:03.068
I tell them to do unto others
as they would have others do unto them.

01:03:09.711 --> 01:03:14.420
Our God is a God of salvation,
not of revenge.

01:03:16.885 --> 01:03:19.672
Only through faith is there salvation.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:23.717
And only through love is there hope.

01:03:24.434 --> 01:03:27.720
Knock, and it shall be opened to you.

01:03:27.854 --> 01:03:30.392
Ask, and it shall be given to you.

01:03:31.817 --> 01:03:35.232
Have faith, and you shall be made well.

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:39.944
Believe, and you shall live for ever.

01:03:41.952 --> 01:03:45.819
Walk with the glory of God in your heart.

01:03:46.998 --> 01:03:52.538
Why do you speak of walking...
to us who are crippled?

01:03:54.172 --> 01:03:58.004
In the eyes of God, no man is crippled,

01:03:59.219 --> 01:04:01.888
except in his soul.

01:04:02.013 --> 01:04:04.469
That's simple for you to say.

01:04:05.725 --> 01:04:07.967
I cannot walk.

01:04:14.484 --> 01:04:18.233
Rise... and you shall walk.

01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:29.615
Are you mocking me?
I tell you, I cannot walk.

01:04:30.083 --> 01:04:35.422
You have not tried because
your faith is weaker than your legs.

01:04:37.090 --> 01:04:41.088
I worship God, and my faith is strong.

01:04:41.803 --> 01:04:43.630
Rise...

01:04:45.307 --> 01:04:47.346
and walk!

01:06:29.703 --> 01:06:31.742
Look, I'm walking.

01:06:35.292 --> 01:06:37.331
Look at me. I'm walking.

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:42.958
You...

01:06:44.134 --> 01:06:48.428
Jesus of Nazareth,
you... you have made me walk.

01:06:52.726 --> 01:06:54.932
No.

01:06:55.061 --> 01:06:58.146
It is your faith that has made you well.

01:06:58.273 --> 01:07:00.645
There are many who cannot walk.

01:07:00.775 --> 01:07:05.402
There are many more who can...
but will not.

01:07:10.118 --> 01:07:12.158
Look, I walk!

01:07:14.915 --> 01:07:16.954
I walk.

01:08:22.399 --> 01:08:24.805
Baptist!

01:08:24.943 --> 01:08:27.481
I have orders to bring you to King Herod.

01:08:31.323 --> 01:08:35.024
I have orders
to bring you to God, heathen.

01:08:36.872 --> 01:08:39.363
Will you come with us peacefully?

01:08:39.499 --> 01:08:42.536
I won't come with you at all.

01:09:05.066 --> 01:09:06.893
Repent!

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:15.277
Repent!

01:09:28.465 --> 01:09:32.332
Your Majesty. The man is an animal!

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:53.984
I've heard many things about you, Baptist.

01:09:54.491 --> 01:09:58.405
And I've heard many things
about you, Herod. All bad.

01:09:58.537 --> 01:10:00.576
- Repent!
- Bring him out.

01:10:13.218 --> 01:10:15.709
Do you know to whom you are talking?

01:10:18.598 --> 01:10:22.181
- I am your king.
- I have no king...

01:10:24.020 --> 01:10:25.978
but the Lord God.

01:10:26.106 --> 01:10:30.353
- Where does he reign?
- Over all that has been,

01:10:30.485 --> 01:10:34.150
- and all that will be.
- How may I meet him?

01:10:34.281 --> 01:10:39.026
By standing in the next line
you come to, this side of hell.

01:10:45.167 --> 01:10:47.206
Christ has come.

01:10:54.676 --> 01:10:56.752
Christ has come.

01:10:56.887 --> 01:10:59.591
Where do I find this Christ?

01:10:59.723 --> 01:11:02.474
- If there is such a one?
- He'll find you.

01:11:02.976 --> 01:11:07.934
- I asked a question. I want an answer.
- Your answer's in the fires of hell, Herod.

01:11:09.149 --> 01:11:11.604
Hell? There is no hell.

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:15.189
You'll stand at the Judgment
with the other sinners.

01:11:15.322 --> 01:11:18.406
- You speak absurdities.
- I see your queen.

01:11:18.533 --> 01:11:20.989
Your brother's wife.

01:11:21.119 --> 01:11:23.527
- Adulteress!
- You will die for this.

01:11:23.663 --> 01:11:26.201
- You'll burn in hell for that.
- Take him away.

01:11:26.333 --> 01:11:29.452
- In your bed you may smell the smoke.
- No pardon for you.

01:11:29.586 --> 01:11:32.373
And none for you either.

01:11:32.506 --> 01:11:34.961
No pardon for you, Herod!

01:11:36.635 --> 01:11:39.007
King Herod!

01:11:39.971 --> 01:11:42.011
I pity you!

01:11:57.697 --> 01:12:00.615
I have come from the River Jordan.

01:12:00.742 --> 01:12:03.363
The baptist was taken prisoner by Herod.

01:12:06.456 --> 01:12:09.540
Is that why you come to us in the night?

01:12:09.668 --> 01:12:12.289
I have been baptised by John the Baptist.

01:12:14.506 --> 01:12:16.380
I am Simon.

01:12:16.508 --> 01:12:19.959
Among the sons of women,
there has not been a greater than John.

01:12:21.054 --> 01:12:23.510
There is much to be done.

01:12:24.975 --> 01:12:27.430
You are welcome, Simon.

01:12:30.105 --> 01:12:35.858
Come unto me,
all ye that labour and are heavy laden,

01:12:35.986 --> 01:12:38.903
and I will give you rest.

01:12:39.030 --> 01:12:43.028
Take my yoke upon you and learn of me,

01:12:43.910 --> 01:12:47.113
for I am meek and lowly in heart,

01:12:47.247 --> 01:12:49.785
and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

01:12:51.293 --> 01:12:56.453
For my yoke is easy
and my burden is light.

01:12:56.590 --> 01:12:59.875
I am Thaddeus. May we follow you?

01:13:00.010 --> 01:13:02.548
- I am Thomas.
- Follow me.

01:13:05.182 --> 01:13:08.266
<i> I am the bread of life.</i>

01:13:08.393 --> 01:13:11.892
<i>He who comes to me shall not hunger.</i>

01:13:12.022 --> 01:13:16.980
<i>And he who believes in me</i>
<i>shall never thirst.</i>

01:13:17.611 --> 01:13:19.568
What's happening?

01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:22.650
It's the preacher from Nazareth.

01:13:23.074 --> 01:13:26.858
Large crowds gather to listen,
and all one hears is "Jesus of Nazareth".

01:13:26.995 --> 01:13:30.945
- Did you see him cure that cripple?
- With my own eyes, Lord Caiaphas.

01:13:31.082 --> 01:13:36.124
Tell me, how can we know
if the man was really crippled?

01:13:36.254 --> 01:13:39.504
I know this man, and this is
the first time I have seen him walk.

01:13:39.633 --> 01:13:43.547
Ridiculous! A tale for children.

01:13:44.387 --> 01:13:46.214
Sorcery.

01:13:48.683 --> 01:13:50.925
Sorak,

01:13:51.061 --> 01:13:54.644
I want you to go to Galilee
and investigate this matter.

01:13:56.566 --> 01:13:58.606
Of course.

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:03.734
But I say only a child
would believe such a story.

01:14:07.035 --> 01:14:11.033
Sorak, I will accompany you
to Capernaum.

01:14:11.164 --> 01:14:14.450
I've always been fond
of children's stories.

01:14:14.584 --> 01:14:16.707
I will go with you, Nicodemus.

01:14:16.837 --> 01:14:20.751
Children's stories always have
a certain truth within them.

01:14:24.261 --> 01:14:30.050
<i> I am the good shepherd,</i>
<i>and I know mine, and mine know me.</i>

01:14:30.183 --> 01:14:32.223
<i>And they shall hear my voice,</i>

01:14:32.352 --> 01:14:36.646
<i>and there shall be</i>
<i>one fold and one shepherd.</i>

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:38.813
Who is he?

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:46.076
Jesus of Nazareth!

01:14:50.918 --> 01:14:55.247
They are saying that this Nazarene
made a crippled man walk,

01:14:55.381 --> 01:14:59.295
and there are rumours
of even more astounding things.

01:14:59.426 --> 01:15:03.127
I have a report, Your Majesty,
that he is gathering an army.

01:15:03.931 --> 01:15:09.008
- An army? Is this true?
- It could hardly be called that.

01:15:09.144 --> 01:15:12.513
Only a handful travel with him,
no more than ten or 12.

01:15:12.648 --> 01:15:16.147
Ten or 12 may travel with him,
but thousands come to hear him.

01:15:16.277 --> 01:15:19.859
Bring that baptist out.
I want to talk to him.

01:15:25.494 --> 01:15:29.788
Is this creature your prisoner,
or are you his?

01:15:34.378 --> 01:15:36.916
How do you find your lodgings, Baptist?

01:15:37.047 --> 01:15:40.748
Lonely... if the Lord weren't with me.

01:15:40.885 --> 01:15:43.506
You are not alone, then, in your cell?

01:15:43.637 --> 01:15:46.722
No. God comforts me.

01:15:48.976 --> 01:15:51.467
He sustains me.

01:15:51.604 --> 01:15:53.643
You talk like a fool.

01:15:56.525 --> 01:15:59.609
- And I pray for your soul.
- Forget my soul.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:03.735
Not till you remember it.

01:16:05.284 --> 01:16:09.993
Go to your knees,
ask God to forgive your sins.

01:16:10.497 --> 01:16:13.035
Send back your brother's wife.

01:16:15.461 --> 01:16:17.288
Now.

01:16:22.092 --> 01:16:25.544
Kill me, Herod. That you can do.

01:16:27.556 --> 01:16:29.845
Kill me,

01:16:29.975 --> 01:16:32.762
so I can live.

01:16:32.895 --> 01:16:35.600
Before you leave us, Baptist,

01:16:35.731 --> 01:16:39.563
it grieves me to ask
what you mean by that.

01:16:39.693 --> 01:16:42.363
My body's worth nothing,

01:16:42.488 --> 01:16:45.323
you can do what you like with it.

01:16:45.449 --> 01:16:50.906
But my soul is eternal...
and you can't touch it.

01:16:59.380 --> 01:17:02.962
What do you know about a man
named Jesus, from Nazareth?

01:17:04.343 --> 01:17:06.336
- He's the one.
- The one what?

01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:10.764
Jesus is gathering to himself
the souls of men,

01:17:12.977 --> 01:17:15.218
as a shepherd gathers in his flock.

01:17:15.354 --> 01:17:18.723
Even now, in your own kingdom,

01:17:18.857 --> 01:17:22.641
there is an army growing greater
than anything you can imagine.

01:17:22.778 --> 01:17:26.194
You hear, Your Majesty?
An army. It's true.

01:17:26.323 --> 01:17:28.446
So I have my answer.

01:17:28.576 --> 01:17:32.360
It is my kingdom that
this Galilean rebel wants.

01:17:32.496 --> 01:17:34.738
Take him back!

01:17:37.710 --> 01:17:40.165
Let them put him to death...

01:17:42.464 --> 01:17:44.671
and it will ease your mind.

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.256
Can you promise me that?

01:17:52.308 --> 01:17:55.973
<i> If anyone wants</i>
<i>to follow in my footsteps,</i>

01:17:56.103 --> 01:17:59.057
<i>he must give up all right to himself.</i>

01:17:59.857 --> 01:18:04.318
<i>Day after day he must</i>
<i>take up his cross and follow me.</i>

01:18:08.574 --> 01:18:10.198
<i>I assure you,</i>

01:18:10.326 --> 01:18:15.237
<i>whosoever shall not receive</i>
<i>the Kingdom of God as a little child,</i>

01:18:15.372 --> 01:18:17.828
<i>he shall not enter therein.</i>

01:18:18.208 --> 01:18:22.752
<i>Suffer the little children</i>
<i>to come unto me, and forbid them not.</i>

01:18:23.756 --> 01:18:27.338
<i>The kingdom of heaven</i>
<i>belongs to such as these.</i>

01:18:28.594 --> 01:18:30.421
Master.

01:18:33.933 --> 01:18:36.174
Come back to Capernaum.

01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:38.848
- What is your name?
- James.

01:18:40.397 --> 01:18:42.556
Have you come this far for me, James?

01:18:42.691 --> 01:18:45.811
I have. And I plead with you.

01:18:45.945 --> 01:18:50.073
We hunger for your words. Come back
to Capernaum and make us full.

01:19:23.482 --> 01:19:27.350
As you can see, this Nazarene
has gained a certain popularity.

01:19:27.903 --> 01:19:31.818
You mean that all those people
are here because of him?

01:19:31.949 --> 01:19:34.701
Every day new ones arrive.

01:19:45.045 --> 01:19:47.204
Hallelujah!

01:19:49.300 --> 01:19:51.873
Behold our Messiah!

01:20:48.442 --> 01:20:52.309
Hail, Son of David.

01:21:07.002 --> 01:21:09.540
Why do you treat this woman so?

01:21:10.881 --> 01:21:13.965
What has she done to deserve this?

01:21:14.093 --> 01:21:17.378
She was caught in the act of adultery.

01:21:27.690 --> 01:21:30.145
Is this true?

01:21:47.251 --> 01:21:51.165
You have judged her rightly.
She is guilty of adultery.

01:21:53.632 --> 01:21:56.170
The Law calls for her to be stoned.

01:21:57.094 --> 01:21:58.921
Yes.

01:22:02.224 --> 01:22:06.518
Let him among you who is
without sin cast the first stone.

01:22:41.096 --> 01:22:43.136
Who are you?

01:22:45.893 --> 01:22:49.178
Mary... of Magdala.

01:22:50.731 --> 01:22:53.518
No man speaks against you now, Mary.

01:22:58.697 --> 01:23:00.607
Neither do I.

01:23:15.089 --> 01:23:17.295
Go your way,

01:23:17.424 --> 01:23:19.464
and sin no more.

01:23:21.053 --> 01:23:23.805
But how can he forgive a woman of sins?

01:23:36.777 --> 01:23:39.315
- Cure me, Master. Cure me!
- Touch me!

01:23:39.446 --> 01:23:41.984
- Mercy.
- Let me touch him.

01:23:42.116 --> 01:23:44.523
Mercy, Lord. Lord!

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:46.699
Make me well.

01:24:17.818 --> 01:24:19.858
I'm cured.

01:24:21.405 --> 01:24:22.864
I'm cured!

01:24:24.450 --> 01:24:27.119
It is your faith that has cured you.

01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:29.411
You.

01:24:29.788 --> 01:24:31.828
- You.
- Master.

01:24:50.059 --> 01:24:51.802
You are our Messiah!

01:24:51.936 --> 01:24:56.396
Hail the king! Hail the king! Hail the king!

01:24:58.567 --> 01:25:02.067
I'm sending word of this
to Jerusalem at once.

01:26:04.049 --> 01:26:06.920
Sire. A messenger
from Capernaum.

01:26:09.305 --> 01:26:11.843
He brings us news of the Nazarene.

01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:16.056
Brings us news of whom?

01:26:16.186 --> 01:26:18.393
- Jesus, Your Majesty.
- The Galilean.

01:26:18.522 --> 01:26:22.851
Sire, in Capernaum they are
calling this carpenter their king.

01:26:24.069 --> 01:26:25.480
King?

01:26:25.613 --> 01:26:29.693
No one has ever caused
such excitement, Your Majesty.

01:26:29.825 --> 01:26:32.363
I do not believe these things I hear.

01:26:33.954 --> 01:26:38.415
People worship him.
They go to their knees before him.

01:26:38.542 --> 01:26:42.326
Your Majesty, they call him
"king" in your kingdom.

01:26:42.463 --> 01:26:44.870
I saw it with my own eyes.

01:26:45.007 --> 01:26:47.545
A sick child touched him and was cured.

01:26:48.677 --> 01:26:51.168
Leprosy, Your Majesty.

01:26:52.056 --> 01:26:54.297
You saw this?

01:26:54.433 --> 01:26:58.016
As he was leaving the town,
great crowds followed him.

01:27:00.064 --> 01:27:02.436
I've heard enough.

01:27:02.566 --> 01:27:04.891
Leave me.

01:27:05.986 --> 01:27:08.026
May I suggest haste?

01:27:08.155 --> 01:27:10.693
You may suggest anything you please.

01:27:11.784 --> 01:27:13.823
Now leave me.

01:27:14.954 --> 01:27:16.946
They grew hungry.

01:27:17.081 --> 01:27:22.039
He fed them all, thousands of people,
from a few loaves and fishes.

01:27:34.306 --> 01:27:36.133
Baptist?

01:27:40.729 --> 01:27:42.556
Baptist?

01:27:45.651 --> 01:27:47.442
Herod.

01:27:47.570 --> 01:27:50.143
The one you call the Christ,

01:27:50.281 --> 01:27:52.772
others are calling "king".

01:27:55.302 --> 01:27:58.386
They shall call
the Son of Man many things,

01:28:00.557 --> 01:28:02.467
and worship his name.

01:28:02.601 --> 01:28:07.097
I will take him for my prisoner,
and his fate shall be as yours.

01:28:07.231 --> 01:28:12.308
He will triumph over all the forces
you can bring against him,

01:28:12.444 --> 01:28:14.816
you mighty one,

01:28:14.947 --> 01:28:17.616
because he's the one prophesied.

01:28:17.741 --> 01:28:20.908
- He was born in Bethlehem.
- Then he cannot be the one.

01:28:21.036 --> 01:28:26.244
My father knew the prophecy, too, and
took measures that it never be fulfilled.

01:28:26.375 --> 01:28:30.455
The child he tried to kill
was taken from his cradle to Egypt.

01:28:30.587 --> 01:28:32.829
He lives today.

01:28:37.011 --> 01:28:39.050
You lie!

01:28:43.225 --> 01:28:46.309
Then listen to him
who walks your kingdom.

01:28:47.438 --> 01:28:49.514
Listen well to what he says.

01:28:51.442 --> 01:28:55.985
For your swords
will be useless against him.

01:28:56.572 --> 01:28:59.110
I will argue with you no more.

01:29:02.036 --> 01:29:03.827
I came to say farewell.

01:29:03.954 --> 01:29:06.492
Farewell?

01:29:06.623 --> 01:29:09.541
That's a word for friends.
Why do you use it with me?

01:29:09.668 --> 01:29:12.705
I have never liked you, Baptist,

01:29:12.838 --> 01:29:15.922
yet I cannot bring myself to hate you.

01:29:19.094 --> 01:29:21.383
I had not intended this night to happen.

01:29:22.473 --> 01:29:24.679
You're going to free me.

01:29:24.808 --> 01:29:28.427
- I'm going to kill you.
- Then you free me.

01:29:28.562 --> 01:29:30.140
I hope so.

01:30:47.266 --> 01:30:49.971
Repent!

01:31:02.865 --> 01:31:04.692
<i> Repent.</i>

01:31:18.047 --> 01:31:21.961
Now take as many men
as you need and arrest the Nazarene.

01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:30.676
<i> Blessed are they which are</i>
<i>persecuted for righteousness' sake,</i>

01:31:30.805 --> 01:31:34.174
<i>for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</i>

01:31:34.309 --> 01:31:36.765
Blessed are you

01:31:36.895 --> 01:31:42.102
when men shall revile you
and persecute you,

01:31:42.234 --> 01:31:47.275
and say all manner of evil
against you falsely for my sake.

01:31:49.616 --> 01:31:55.037
Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

01:31:56.039 --> 01:32:00.831
Blessed are they that mourn,
for they shall be comforted.

01:32:02.212 --> 01:32:07.372
Blessed are the meek,
for they shall inherit the earth.

01:32:08.093 --> 01:32:12.553
Blessed are they which do hunger
and thirst after righteousness,

01:32:13.682 --> 01:32:16.137
for they shall be filled.

01:32:16.810 --> 01:32:21.519
Blessed are the merciful,
for they shall obtain mercy.

01:32:22.566 --> 01:32:27.904
Blessed are the pure in heart,
for they shall see God.

01:32:28.780 --> 01:32:34.735
Blessed are the peacemakers, for
they shall be called the children of God.

01:32:36.204 --> 01:32:38.742
You are the salt of the earth.

01:32:40.083 --> 01:32:42.621
You are the light of the world.

01:32:43.962 --> 01:32:47.710
And let your light so shine before men

01:32:47.841 --> 01:32:50.711
that they may see your good works,

01:32:50.844 --> 01:32:54.972
and glorify your Father
which is in heaven.

01:32:56.516 --> 01:33:00.644
In this manner, therefore, shall you pray:

01:33:02.856 --> 01:33:05.940
- Our Father...
- Our Father...

01:33:06.067 --> 01:33:09.234
- who art in heaven...
- who art in heaven...

01:33:11.823 --> 01:33:14.943
- What else?
- Two messengers from Capernaum,

01:33:15.076 --> 01:33:17.116
both reporting the same thing.

01:33:17.245 --> 01:33:20.661
It began with a riot in the streets,
but has now become a rebellion.

01:33:20.790 --> 01:33:23.957
The party responsible
is one Jesus of Nazareth.

01:33:24.085 --> 01:33:28.794
He already has a large following
and they are hailing him as king.

01:33:33.136 --> 01:33:35.378
One day we hear
this man has cured a cripple.

01:33:35.513 --> 01:33:38.051
Another day, changed water into wine.

01:33:39.476 --> 01:33:42.512
Now we hear that he has fed 5,000 people,

01:33:42.646 --> 01:33:45.765
and nobody seems to know
where the food came from.

01:33:45.899 --> 01:33:48.983
The next thing we know
they'll be calling him the Messiah.

01:33:49.110 --> 01:33:51.732
- And that isn't all.
- What else?

01:33:55.283 --> 01:33:57.525
He walked on water.

01:33:57.661 --> 01:33:59.700
Get out!

01:34:09.631 --> 01:34:14.293
Tell me, who do men say that I am?

01:34:16.263 --> 01:34:19.596
Some say another John the Baptist.

01:34:19.724 --> 01:34:21.883
Others say you are one of the prophets.

01:34:23.353 --> 01:34:26.058
Who do you say that I am, Judas?

01:34:29.484 --> 01:34:32.770
You are a great leader.

01:34:32.904 --> 01:34:35.775
The greatest teacher of all.

01:34:38.451 --> 01:34:40.491
And you, Thomas?

01:34:42.289 --> 01:34:46.582
You are Jesus of Nazareth.
That's all I know.

01:34:47.836 --> 01:34:50.327
You are the Messiah!

01:34:50.463 --> 01:34:52.836
The Christ!

01:34:52.966 --> 01:34:55.208
The Son of the Living God!

01:34:55.635 --> 01:34:58.091
A blessing on you, Peter.

01:34:59.973 --> 01:35:03.057
Because you did not learn
this from mortal man,

01:35:04.728 --> 01:35:07.266
but from my Father who is in heaven.

01:35:11.651 --> 01:35:14.438
You, Peter,

01:35:15.947 --> 01:35:20.656
are the rock on which
I will build my church.

01:35:24.597 --> 01:35:27.219
I will give you the keys of the kingdom.

01:35:28.351 --> 01:35:32.894
And whatever you shall bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven.

01:35:34.149 --> 01:35:38.561
And whatever you allow on earth
shall be allowed in heaven.

01:35:42.324 --> 01:35:44.363
Pharisees, Master.

01:35:51.541 --> 01:35:53.581
Peace be with you.

01:35:54.252 --> 01:35:58.332
You must leave Galilee and go your way.
Herod intends to kill you.

01:35:59.174 --> 01:36:01.712
Go and tell that fox,

01:36:03.720 --> 01:36:08.678
all that was written
by the prophets will come true.

01:36:11.686 --> 01:36:15.138
Today and tomorrow
I shall be on my way.

01:36:15.273 --> 01:36:19.022
And on the third day,
I shall reach my goal.

01:36:20.654 --> 01:36:25.695
For it cannot be that a prophet
perish anywhere but in Jerusalem.

01:36:31.331 --> 01:36:34.248
He must heed our warning.

01:36:34.376 --> 01:36:37.792
We are going to Nazareth,
among his own people.

01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:26.469
There he is. He's come home.

01:37:35.083 --> 01:37:36.701
It's the carpenter.

01:37:38.189 --> 01:37:40.182
It's him.

01:37:42.360 --> 01:37:44.851
What did
he come back here for?

01:37:44.988 --> 01:37:47.443
To show us signs and miracles?

01:37:51.286 --> 01:37:53.243
Show us a sign.

01:37:53.371 --> 01:37:56.954
You're the son of Mary and Joseph.

01:37:57.083 --> 01:38:00.001
That's right. We know you.

01:38:00.128 --> 01:38:04.126
We heard about Capernaum.
You made a cripple walk.

01:38:04.257 --> 01:38:09.548
- Do the same here.
- He spoke the truth. They listened to him.

01:38:09.679 --> 01:38:12.087
I tell you this,

01:38:12.223 --> 01:38:15.094
no prophet is recognised
in his own home.

01:38:17.771 --> 01:38:20.096
Why do you keep us waiting?

01:38:20.231 --> 01:38:23.316
If you are the Messiah, say so plainly.

01:38:29.324 --> 01:38:31.649
I say unto you,

01:38:31.785 --> 01:38:34.240
the prophecy is now fulfilled.

01:38:36.039 --> 01:38:38.494
The spirit of the Lord is upon me,

01:38:38.625 --> 01:38:43.121
because he has anointed me
to announce good news to the poor,

01:38:43.254 --> 01:38:48.213
to give recovery of sight to the blind,
justice and delivery to the afflicted.

01:38:49.678 --> 01:38:53.260
I have come to proclaim
the year of the Lord's favour.

01:38:54.808 --> 01:38:56.847
That's blasphemy!

01:39:00.438 --> 01:39:02.645
Let's get Old Aram.

01:39:03.984 --> 01:39:06.688
- Bring Old Aram.
- Let's get Old Aram.

01:39:06.820 --> 01:39:08.611
Get Aram!

01:39:20.375 --> 01:39:24.040
Make him see. Give him sight.

01:39:29.426 --> 01:39:31.751
Aram,

01:39:31.886 --> 01:39:33.926
it is Jesus.

01:39:35.307 --> 01:39:37.014
Jesus?

01:39:38.685 --> 01:39:41.520
The son of Joseph,

01:39:41.646 --> 01:39:44.813
long gone from us, and Mary.

01:39:46.109 --> 01:39:48.944
I remember you as a child.

01:39:50.322 --> 01:39:53.737
How good of you, Jesus,
to remember me.

01:39:56.161 --> 01:39:59.031
On with it.

01:39:59.164 --> 01:40:01.619
Let us see the sorcery.

01:40:06.004 --> 01:40:07.997
Give him sight.

01:40:08.131 --> 01:40:11.880
If you're not a faker,
show us a miracle.

01:40:14.596 --> 01:40:16.838
It is written...

01:40:20.977 --> 01:40:24.062
"Ye shall not tempt the Lord your God."

01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:30.485
You, a mere man, claim to be God?!

01:40:32.989 --> 01:40:36.738
You have ears, yet you do not hear.

01:40:38.453 --> 01:40:40.778
I say it is blasphemy.

01:40:41.539 --> 01:40:43.947
I say stone him!

01:40:44.084 --> 01:40:48.496
If I am not acting as my Father would,
do not believe me.

01:40:48.630 --> 01:40:53.541
But if I am,
accept the evidence of my deeds,

01:40:53.677 --> 01:40:57.092
so that you may know
that the Father is in me,

01:40:57.222 --> 01:40:59.677
and I in the Father.

01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:09.394
How can you say this to us?
We <i>know</i> you.

01:41:09.901 --> 01:41:11.941
Stone him!

01:41:13.530 --> 01:41:16.068
Stone him! Stone him!

01:42:00.493 --> 01:42:02.285
Master?

01:42:09.085 --> 01:42:11.457
My good friend.

01:42:14.716 --> 01:42:18.500
I have come to warn you.
They are seeking you.

01:42:18.637 --> 01:42:20.676
My brother is ill.

01:42:20.805 --> 01:42:24.470
I don't know how he found
the strength to make this journey.

01:42:24.601 --> 01:42:27.222
Martha and I would
have travelled here alone,

01:42:27.354 --> 01:42:29.927
but we could not stop him
from coming himself.

01:42:30.065 --> 01:42:32.353
I had to tell you.

01:42:32.484 --> 01:42:35.022
You will be arrested and taken to the city.

01:42:35.153 --> 01:42:38.154
The soldiers are even now
on their way here.

01:42:38.281 --> 01:42:41.068
You and your friends must leave at once.

01:43:20.615 --> 01:43:25.158
We'll see that the Master goes to
the Jordan river. There is safety there.

01:43:26.621 --> 01:43:29.907
Andrew and Nathanael
will help you return to your home.

01:43:58.069 --> 01:44:02.530
I know... it is you, Jesus.

01:44:06.619 --> 01:44:08.826
Oh, I remember you.

01:44:23.345 --> 01:44:25.800
Now you have grown so tall.

01:44:29.142 --> 01:44:32.060
At one time, when you
were a little fellow, you...

01:44:32.896 --> 01:44:37.024
you were always asking questions. And...

01:45:19.401 --> 01:45:21.440
Lord!

01:45:24.322 --> 01:45:26.149
Lord!

01:45:26.950 --> 01:45:29.108
Lord!

01:45:29.244 --> 01:45:31.865
Lazarus is sick and dying.

01:45:33.999 --> 01:45:36.157
They beg you to come at once.

01:45:38.253 --> 01:45:44.006
This sickness has not come
for the death of Lazarus,

01:45:45.802 --> 01:45:48.258
but for the glory of God.

01:46:06.239 --> 01:46:08.279
Master...

01:46:09.743 --> 01:46:12.281
are men like circles in the water?

01:46:15.081 --> 01:46:18.996
Do they just... float away and are lost?

01:46:27.886 --> 01:46:32.844
It was right there
where John the Baptist stood.

01:46:36.478 --> 01:46:40.855
When the baptist prayed... I felt good.

01:46:45.779 --> 01:46:50.488
Our Father, who art in heaven,

01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:54.640
hallowed be thy name.

01:46:56.229 --> 01:46:58.268
Thy kingdom come,

01:47:00.400 --> 01:47:02.439
thy will be done...

01:47:09.033 --> 01:47:12.983
Thy will be done,
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:47:13.121 --> 01:47:14.948
As it is in heaven.

01:47:15.081 --> 01:47:19.031
- Give us this day our daily bread,
- Give us this day our daily bread,

01:47:19.168 --> 01:47:21.790
and forgive us our debts
as we forgive our debtors.

01:47:21.921 --> 01:47:24.922
And forgive us our debts
as we forgive our debtors.

01:47:25.049 --> 01:47:28.549
- And lead us not into temptation,
- And lead us not into temptation,

01:47:28.678 --> 01:47:31.798
- but deliver us from evil.
- But deliver us from evil.

01:47:31.931 --> 01:47:35.098
- For thine is the kingdom,
- For thine is the kingdom,

01:47:35.226 --> 01:47:38.642
- and the power, and the glory,
- and the power, and the glory,

01:47:38.771 --> 01:47:42.437
- for ever and ever.
- For ever and ever.

01:47:42.567 --> 01:47:45.188
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:47:47.739 --> 01:47:50.230
- Peter?
- What is it?

01:47:50.366 --> 01:47:54.150
- We came as fast as we could.
- We've lost Lazarus.

01:47:54.287 --> 01:47:58.332
Master, Lazarus is dead in Bethany.

01:48:00.251 --> 01:48:03.537
You have cured many people,

01:48:03.671 --> 01:48:06.209
yet you did not help your friend.

01:48:07.508 --> 01:48:11.423
I am glad for your sake
that I was not there, Nathanael.

01:48:12.889 --> 01:48:15.344
So that you may believe.

01:48:18.478 --> 01:48:21.183
Let us go to Bethany.

01:48:21.314 --> 01:48:24.231
If Lazarus is dead,
what need is there to go now?

01:48:24.609 --> 01:48:27.314
Why? Why must you go?

01:48:29.489 --> 01:48:31.528
My Father's work is there.

01:50:02.457 --> 01:50:05.458
Have you come to bury the dead?

01:50:10.089 --> 01:50:12.627
Or have you come to feed the mourners?

01:50:19.849 --> 01:50:22.305
You made a leper well.

01:50:23.436 --> 01:50:25.892
You made a cripple walk.

01:50:27.148 --> 01:50:31.442
Was it too much to ask that
you keep my brother from dying?

01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:35.987
Why do you come now that he's dead,

01:50:36.115 --> 01:50:38.867
when you could have come
while he lived?

01:50:38.993 --> 01:50:41.365
When he needed you!

01:50:41.496 --> 01:50:43.323
Why?

01:50:44.457 --> 01:50:46.746
Your brother will rise again.

01:50:46.876 --> 01:50:50.126
Rise? Yes, he will rise.

01:50:51.422 --> 01:50:56.962
On Judgment Day
at the resurrection of us all!

01:50:59.013 --> 01:51:04.174
I am the resurrection... and the life.

01:51:06.563 --> 01:51:09.647
He that believeth in me,

01:51:09.774 --> 01:51:12.728
though he were dead,

01:51:12.861 --> 01:51:14.900
yet shall he live.

01:51:16.531 --> 01:51:20.279
And whosoever liveth
and believeth in me...

01:51:23.162 --> 01:51:25.451
shall never die.

01:51:29.419 --> 01:51:32.752
Do you believe this, Martha?

01:51:40.638 --> 01:51:44.007
Do <i>you</i> believe this, Mary?

01:51:44.976 --> 01:51:47.432
If you had only been here,

01:51:49.272 --> 01:51:52.356
I believe that Lazarus
would not have died.

01:53:06.099 --> 01:53:10.476
Who is like thee, O Father in heaven?

01:53:11.688 --> 01:53:14.179
Majestic in holiness,

01:53:14.315 --> 01:53:17.102
terrible in glorious deeds,

01:53:17.235 --> 01:53:19.109
doing wonders?

01:53:19.237 --> 01:53:22.487
There is none
that can deliver out of thy hand.

01:53:23.283 --> 01:53:26.449
You wound and you heal.

01:53:27.370 --> 01:53:31.119
You kill and you make alive.

01:53:36.462 --> 01:53:39.962
Come from the four winds, O breath,

01:53:40.091 --> 01:53:45.133
and breathe upon
this man that he may live.

01:54:20.506 --> 01:54:22.333
Lazarus.

01:54:47.158 --> 01:54:48.985
Lazarus.

01:54:53.414 --> 01:54:55.454
Come forth!

01:57:08.591 --> 01:57:10.169
- What happened?
- Did you see?

01:57:10.301 --> 01:57:12.792
- See?
- Jesus of Nazareth.

01:57:12.929 --> 01:57:16.629
I saw it. I saw it with my own eyes.
Lazarus was dead.

01:57:16.766 --> 01:57:18.260
He's alive!

01:57:36.369 --> 01:57:38.409
He's alive.

01:58:06.983 --> 01:58:08.976
The Messiah has come!

01:58:17.744 --> 01:58:24.625
~ <i>The kingdom of our Lord</i>
<i>and of His Christ</i>

01:58:24.751 --> 01:58:27.324

~ <i>Hallelujah, hallelujah!</i>

01:59:17.637 --> 01:59:20.342
The Messiah has come!

01:59:20.473 --> 01:59:23.509
A man was dead and now he lives!

01:59:23.643 --> 01:59:26.810
I was crippled, and now I walk!

01:59:29.315 --> 01:59:32.684
I was blind, and now I see!

01:59:33.361 --> 01:59:36.232
Who has done this?

01:59:36.364 --> 01:59:38.985
The man called Jesus.

01:59:39.367 --> 01:59:46.200
~ <i>Hallelujah!</i>

02:03:18.336 --> 02:03:20.044
There is a rumour in the streets.

02:03:20.171 --> 02:03:23.505
They say that a man in Bethany
has been raised from the dead.

02:03:23.633 --> 02:03:28.295
Raised from the dead? And who,
might I ask, achieved this miracle?

02:03:28.429 --> 02:03:30.469
The Galilean.

02:03:41.568 --> 02:03:46.989
O give thanks unto the Lord,

02:03:47.115 --> 02:03:51.326
for he is good,

02:03:51.452 --> 02:03:58.120
for his mercy endureth for ever.

02:03:59.794 --> 02:04:06.544
O give thanks unto the God of gods,

02:04:06.676 --> 02:04:13.129
for his mercy endureth for ever.

02:04:14.934 --> 02:04:20.854
O give thanks to the Lord of lords,

02:04:21.357 --> 02:04:27.976
for his mercy endureth for ever;

02:04:29.073 --> 02:04:32.442
to him who alone

02:04:33.661 --> 02:04:37.576
doeth great wonders,

02:04:37.707 --> 02:04:42.286
to him that by wisdom

02:04:42.420 --> 02:04:46.418
made the heavens,

02:04:46.549 --> 02:04:54.213
to him that stretched out
the earth above the waters,

02:04:55.016 --> 02:05:01.635
for his mercy endureth for ever;

02:05:03.608 --> 02:05:08.947
to him who made great lights,

02:05:10.031 --> 02:05:15.370
the sun to rule by day,

02:05:16.621 --> 02:05:22.208
the moon and the stars
to rule by night;

02:05:23.294 --> 02:05:29.130
for his mercy endureth for ever.

02:05:29.259 --> 02:05:31.714
Where did you get that oil?

02:05:38.226 --> 02:05:40.764
I'm asking you where you got this oil.

02:05:45.942 --> 02:05:50.070
This is expensive ointment.
Are you going to let her waste it like this?

02:05:51.739 --> 02:05:53.779
Leave her alone.

02:05:56.244 --> 02:05:59.743
Do you know this could have
been sold for 300 pence?

02:06:00.915 --> 02:06:03.453
It's a waste when there are so many poor.

02:06:06.379 --> 02:06:09.878
Do you care so much for the poor, Judas?

02:06:13.428 --> 02:06:15.883
What are we, if not poor?

02:06:17.599 --> 02:06:20.718
You speak of the poor.

02:06:20.852 --> 02:06:23.390
The poor you have with you always.

02:06:25.565 --> 02:06:28.519
Do not begrudge me this bit of oil,

02:06:30.111 --> 02:06:32.567
for me you have not always.

02:06:54.594 --> 02:07:00.348
O give thanks unto the Lord,

02:07:01.142 --> 02:07:02.767
for he is good.

02:07:02.894 --> 02:07:06.559
She is preparing me for my burial.

02:07:06.689 --> 02:07:12.360
...mercy endureth for ever.

02:07:13.905 --> 02:07:20.524
O give thanks unto the God of gods,

02:07:20.662 --> 02:07:27.281
for his mercy endureth for ever.

02:07:28.795 --> 02:07:35.248
O give thanks to the Lord of lords,

02:07:35.385 --> 02:07:42.716
for his mercy endureth for ever;

02:07:43.977 --> 02:07:48.105
to him alone...

02:08:39.949 --> 02:08:42.405
Hosanna!

02:08:42.535 --> 02:08:45.240
Hosanna! Hosanna!

02:08:45.371 --> 02:08:48.456
Hosanna! Hallelujah!

02:10:14.377 --> 02:10:17.876
- He must be arrested.
- An arrest on a holiday, Lord Caiaphas?

02:10:18.006 --> 02:10:20.461
Hear that?

02:10:20.592 --> 02:10:23.546
They call him "king". "Messiah".

02:10:27.015 --> 02:10:29.422
Go! Take as many guards
as you will need.

02:11:10.391 --> 02:11:12.431
I am honoured.

02:11:12.560 --> 02:11:17.436
"My house shall be called
a house of prayer," says the Lord.

02:11:18.233 --> 02:11:21.643
But you have made it a den of thieves!

02:11:22.195 --> 02:11:24.686
It is written in the scriptures

02:11:24.822 --> 02:11:26.862
"I desire mercy,

02:11:28.493 --> 02:11:30.532
not sacrifice."

02:11:36.834 --> 02:11:39.290
"Rather the knowledge of God,

02:11:41.422 --> 02:11:43.462
than burnt offerings."

02:11:46.386 --> 02:11:52.673
"I do not delight in the blood
of bulls, and lambs, and goats."

02:11:58.565 --> 02:12:02.645
You cannot buy yourself
in the house of the Lord!

02:12:05.113 --> 02:12:09.988
You have made a robbers' cave
of my Father's house! Robbers!

02:12:12.328 --> 02:12:14.368
Get out!

02:12:15.039 --> 02:12:17.744
You have defiled this holy ground!

02:12:29.596 --> 02:12:34.934
Think not that I have come
to destroy the Law or the prophets.

02:12:35.935 --> 02:12:40.846
I have not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

02:12:41.816 --> 02:12:44.852
These scribes and these Pharisees,

02:12:44.986 --> 02:12:49.399
all things which
they tell you to do, do them!

02:12:49.991 --> 02:12:53.325
But do not take
their works as your example,

02:12:53.453 --> 02:12:56.026
for they do not practise what they preach.

02:12:56.998 --> 02:13:01.874
Everything they do,
they do to be seen doing it.

02:13:02.003 --> 02:13:05.337
And for pretence they make long prayers.

02:13:05.757 --> 02:13:10.964
They like to be called "father", "teacher".

02:13:11.095 --> 02:13:13.053
I tell you now,

02:13:13.181 --> 02:13:18.388
there is only one teacher and one Father.

02:13:19.437 --> 02:13:23.649
He is your Father which is in heaven.

02:13:24.150 --> 02:13:29.310
Your Majesty, they are saying the Messiah
has come. The Anointed One. Christ.

02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:36.994
Governor Pilate wants to know what
you are doing about this disturbance.

02:13:38.873 --> 02:13:42.040
The man is being arrested.

02:13:42.835 --> 02:13:45.711
The people...
They would not let us take him.

02:13:50.635 --> 02:13:54.300
You, too, have your troubles
with Jerusalem, Governor.

02:13:54.430 --> 02:13:58.428
- They are a very difficult people.
- Nothing I can't handle, I assure you.

02:14:03.606 --> 02:14:07.307
The situation is beyond their control.
The crowds grow more difficult.

02:14:07.443 --> 02:14:09.650
- Move out and restore order.
- Yes, sir.

02:14:09.779 --> 02:14:13.029
Clear the streets. Close the gates,
and maintain the peace.

02:14:13.157 --> 02:14:16.158
- Yes, sir.
- Double the guard around King Herod.

02:14:16.286 --> 02:14:22.075
We'd regret it if something unpleasant
happened to so... honoured a guest.

02:14:22.792 --> 02:14:25.995
And bring the Nazarene to me!

02:14:26.129 --> 02:14:28.964
You know,

02:14:29.090 --> 02:14:33.302
he is actually telling people
to love their enemies.

02:14:49.861 --> 02:14:52.316
Hosanna!

02:14:53.823 --> 02:14:56.990
I have come to bring
salvation to the world.

02:14:57.118 --> 02:14:59.158
Hosanna!

02:15:02.707 --> 02:15:06.206
I have come as a light into the world.

02:15:08.588 --> 02:15:14.460
And no man who has faith in me
will go on living in the dark.

02:15:17.055 --> 02:15:22.725
And if any man gives ear to my words
and does not keep them,

02:15:23.686 --> 02:15:26.094
I shall not be his judge.

02:15:26.814 --> 02:15:32.651
I have not come to bring judgment
but salvation to the world.

02:15:36.699 --> 02:15:40.993
While you have the light, walk in the light.

02:15:42.664 --> 02:15:45.036
While you have the light,

02:15:45.166 --> 02:15:48.286
put your faith in the light,

02:15:48.419 --> 02:15:51.290
that you may become sons of the light.

02:15:53.383 --> 02:15:58.294
Faith, hope and love abide,

02:16:00.056 --> 02:16:03.140
these three.

02:16:03.268 --> 02:16:06.553
But the greatest of these is love.

02:16:08.523 --> 02:16:10.266
And remember,

02:16:11.359 --> 02:16:14.609
where several gather together
in my name,

02:16:16.155 --> 02:16:18.563
there will I be.

02:16:21.744 --> 02:16:25.576
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

02:16:26.457 --> 02:16:29.708
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

02:16:29.836 --> 02:16:32.326
He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures.

02:16:32.672 --> 02:16:35.958
He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures.

02:16:36.092 --> 02:16:38.298
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

02:16:38.553 --> 02:16:41.305
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

02:16:41.431 --> 02:16:44.467
- He restoreth my soul.
- He restoreth my soul.

02:16:44.601 --> 02:16:47.969
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

02:16:48.228 --> 02:16:51.847
He leadeth me in the paths of
righteousness for his name's sake.

02:16:51.983 --> 02:16:56.775
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.

02:16:57.030 --> 02:17:02.486
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil.

02:17:02.619 --> 02:17:05.406
- For thou art with me.
- For thou art with me.

02:17:05.538 --> 02:17:07.745
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

02:17:07.999 --> 02:17:10.952
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

02:17:11.084 --> 02:17:15.035
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.

02:17:15.298 --> 02:17:19.545
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.

02:17:19.677 --> 02:17:22.927
And I will dwell in
the house of the Lord for ever.

02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:45.406
He that hath clean hands
and a pure heart...

02:17:45.537 --> 02:17:48.157
He that hath clean hands
and a pure heart...

02:17:48.289 --> 02:17:52.334
...who hath not lifted up his soul
unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully...

02:17:52.459 --> 02:17:54.701
We only pray.

02:17:57.882 --> 02:17:59.922
Stand aside.

02:18:08.226 --> 02:18:09.850
Stand aside.

02:18:12.021 --> 02:18:15.521
...that seek thy face, O Jacob.
...that seek thy face, O Jacob.

02:18:15.650 --> 02:18:19.814
- Lift up your heads, O ye gates!
- Lift up your heads, O ye gates!

02:18:19.946 --> 02:18:23.196
And be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors.

02:18:23.324 --> 02:18:25.281
...lift up, ye everlasting doors.

02:18:25.410 --> 02:18:28.079
And the King of glory shall come in.

02:18:28.204 --> 02:18:29.781
Charge!

02:18:29.914 --> 02:18:33.994
- Who is this King of glory?
- Who is this King of glory?

02:18:34.127 --> 02:18:37.994
- The Lord, strong and mighty,
- The Lord, strong and mighty,

02:18:38.130 --> 02:18:42.259
- the Lord, mighty in battle!
- The Lord, mighty in battle!

02:19:12.207 --> 02:19:14.413
- Who is it?
- Me.

02:19:20.505 --> 02:19:23.591
When I ask "Who's there?",
why do you answer "Me"?

02:19:25.469 --> 02:19:27.509
It <i>was</i> me, Peter.

02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:31.846
The Romans are patrolling the streets.

02:19:31.976 --> 02:19:35.808
- Where's the Master?
- He's coming with the others.

02:19:59.212 --> 02:20:00.587
Master.

02:20:50.096 --> 02:20:52.931
Who are you?

02:20:53.057 --> 02:20:55.097
My name is Judas.

02:20:56.519 --> 02:20:58.975
A friend of Jesus of Nazareth.

02:21:00.690 --> 02:21:03.940
Lord Caiaphas, we have a guest.

02:21:14.704 --> 02:21:17.112
His name is Judas.

02:21:17.248 --> 02:21:19.786
He's a friend of the Nazarene.

02:21:39.521 --> 02:21:42.058
How long
have you been his friend?

02:21:45.985 --> 02:21:48.607
I have been Jesus' friend for three years.

02:21:50.740 --> 02:21:53.278
And now you are no longer his friend?

02:21:55.787 --> 02:21:58.325
I am his friend still...

02:22:00.208 --> 02:22:02.247
I believe.

02:22:03.711 --> 02:22:06.167
Why have you come to us?

02:22:08.925 --> 02:22:11.380
I will give him to you...

02:22:14.138 --> 02:22:17.009
if you promise that
no harm will come to him.

02:22:19.394 --> 02:22:22.478
If you are willing to betr...

02:22:23.523 --> 02:22:26.393
to give him to us,

02:22:26.526 --> 02:22:29.064
why do you care what happens to him?

02:22:36.995 --> 02:22:38.821
Jesus...

02:22:40.707 --> 02:22:43.079
is the purest,

02:22:45.003 --> 02:22:47.541
kindest man I have ever known.

02:22:51.217 --> 02:22:54.302
I have never seen him
do anything but good.

02:22:58.016 --> 02:23:00.055
His heart...

02:23:01.311 --> 02:23:03.766
his heart is so gentle.

02:23:07.317 --> 02:23:09.772
Old people worship him.

02:23:13.823 --> 02:23:16.030
Children adore him.

02:23:20.538 --> 02:23:22.578
I love him.

02:23:30.548 --> 02:23:32.375
Very well.

02:23:34.135 --> 02:23:37.718
We will do our best to see
that no harm comes to the man.

02:23:40.141 --> 02:23:42.597
Where do we find him?

02:23:43.561 --> 02:23:45.850
You cannot.

02:23:45.980 --> 02:23:48.518
Just tell us, and we'll send the guards.

02:23:50.902 --> 02:23:53.357
I will lead you to him tonight.

02:23:54.989 --> 02:23:57.231
I must be there.

02:23:58.743 --> 02:24:03.986
I am not so much a coward
that I cannot face him... when I stab him.

02:24:07.794 --> 02:24:10.249
We shall be waiting.

02:24:55.842 --> 02:24:57.669
Father,

02:24:59.262 --> 02:25:01.301
the hour has come.

02:25:15.737 --> 02:25:19.865
You, who have been with me so long,

02:25:22.285 --> 02:25:24.906
who have given up all to follow me,

02:25:26.289 --> 02:25:31.449
to walk with me
down all those dusty roads.

02:25:34.130 --> 02:25:37.001
Through all of it,
you have been my friends.

02:25:38.635 --> 02:25:41.090
And I have loved you.

02:25:43.431 --> 02:25:45.471
But I tell you now,

02:25:47.644 --> 02:25:51.060
the hand that will betray me
is on this table.

02:25:53.900 --> 02:25:55.098
No.

02:25:55.235 --> 02:25:57.808
- Not I, Master.
- Not I.

02:25:57.946 --> 02:26:00.234
No, Master.

02:26:00.365 --> 02:26:03.615
Master, who is it?

02:26:03.743 --> 02:26:05.901
Who is going to betray you?

02:26:06.037 --> 02:26:09.371
One who is eating bread with me tonight.

02:26:11.376 --> 02:26:13.415
Is it I?

02:26:25.473 --> 02:26:29.601
Only for a little while longer am I with you.

02:26:31.479 --> 02:26:34.350
Where I am going you may not come.

02:26:35.817 --> 02:26:38.272
Why can't I come with you now?

02:26:39.821 --> 02:26:42.526
You will come later.

02:26:42.657 --> 02:26:45.362
I will die for you.

02:26:46.619 --> 02:26:50.237
Will you, Peter? Will you die for me?

02:26:51.624 --> 02:26:53.664
I will.

02:26:54.502 --> 02:26:56.294
I will.

02:26:56.421 --> 02:26:58.460
Oh, Peter, Peter,

02:27:00.592 --> 02:27:05.752
I tell you in truth, before the cock crows,
you will have denied me three times.

02:27:10.435 --> 02:27:13.685
Even if I die for you, I will never deny you.

02:27:16.608 --> 02:27:21.649
In my Father's house
there are many mansions.

02:27:25.116 --> 02:27:29.244
If it were not so, I would have told you.

02:27:32.332 --> 02:27:35.701
I am going to prepare
a place for you there.

02:27:35.835 --> 02:27:40.711
Speak plainly and speak no proverbs.
How are we to know where you're going?

02:27:42.717 --> 02:27:44.757
I am the way,

02:27:45.887 --> 02:27:48.841
and the truth, and the life.

02:27:50.600 --> 02:27:53.554
No one comes to the Father but by me.

02:28:28.346 --> 02:28:30.967
Take it, and eat.

02:28:32.392 --> 02:28:36.389
This is my body,
which is being given for you.

02:28:38.439 --> 02:28:41.690
Do this in remembrance of me.

02:29:09.762 --> 02:29:12.004
Drink this.

02:29:14.517 --> 02:29:17.886
For this is my blood of the new testament,

02:29:18.021 --> 02:29:21.686
which shall be shed for many

02:29:21.816 --> 02:29:24.272
for the forgiveness of sins.

02:29:56.059 --> 02:30:02.263
I have greatly desired to eat
this Passover with you... before I suffer.

02:30:10.073 --> 02:30:13.905
I tell you, I will not drink
of the fruit of the vine

02:30:14.035 --> 02:30:17.949
until I drink it new with you
in my Father's kingdom.

02:30:38.810 --> 02:30:41.348
A new commandment I give unto you:

02:30:45.066 --> 02:30:47.522
That you love one another...

02:30:48.778 --> 02:30:51.234
even as I have loved you.

02:31:09.340 --> 02:31:12.792
Do quickly what you have to do.

02:31:36.576 --> 02:31:43.457
Now is the Son of Man glorified.

02:31:51.549 --> 02:31:54.123
I am going to
the Garden of Gethsemane to pray.

02:31:54.260 --> 02:31:56.798
Master, they may come for you there.

02:31:58.640 --> 02:32:00.679
Why must you go?

02:32:02.560 --> 02:32:05.763
A grain of wheat, Andrew,

02:32:05.897 --> 02:32:10.523
is just a grain of wheat.

02:32:12.028 --> 02:32:15.112
But if it is put into the ground and dies,

02:32:16.324 --> 02:32:18.780
many will be born in its name,

02:32:20.537 --> 02:32:22.576
many will live.

02:32:34.717 --> 02:32:36.757
Do you hear it?

02:32:37.600 --> 02:32:40.055
I don't hear anything.

02:32:41.354 --> 02:32:44.936
That's what I mean.
It's the best sound of all.

02:32:56.869 --> 02:33:03.073
<i> Where several are gathered</i>
<i>together in my name, there will I be.</i>

02:33:06.712 --> 02:33:09.250
Judas Iscariot, sit down.

02:33:17.556 --> 02:33:20.012
Hold out your hand.

02:33:30.486 --> 02:33:32.526
Keep watch.

02:34:03.811 --> 02:34:05.638
Father,

02:34:06.939 --> 02:34:09.395
save me from this hour.

02:34:19.577 --> 02:34:21.819
O my Father,

02:34:22.997 --> 02:34:25.239
if it be possible,

02:34:26.334 --> 02:34:28.872
let this cup pass away from me.

02:34:57.823 --> 02:35:02.984
For this cause... I came into this world.

02:35:14.674 --> 02:35:18.802
I came into this world... at your will.

02:35:22.598 --> 02:35:27.141
I am ready... to leave it so.

02:35:30.940 --> 02:35:32.979
O my Father,

02:35:34.777 --> 02:35:37.861
if this cup cannot pass away from me,

02:35:40.074 --> 02:35:42.114
lest I drink it...

02:35:49.625 --> 02:35:52.081
your will be done.

02:35:56.132 --> 02:35:57.377
30.

02:35:57.508 --> 02:36:00.177
I don't want the money.

02:36:00.303 --> 02:36:02.758
Give it, then, to the poor.

02:36:55.733 --> 02:36:58.189
The hour has come.

02:37:27.264 --> 02:37:29.423
Asleep, Peter?

02:37:30.518 --> 02:37:33.056
Could you not watch with me one hour?

02:37:38.067 --> 02:37:40.523
The spirit is willing,

02:37:43.114 --> 02:37:45.569
but the flesh is weak.

02:38:30.077 --> 02:38:31.157
Judas!

02:38:31.287 --> 02:38:34.157
- No, Peter. Put back your sword.
- Master!

02:38:34.290 --> 02:38:38.418
For all that take the sword
shall perish by the sword.

02:38:39.503 --> 02:38:41.994
All my life,

02:38:42.131 --> 02:38:46.045
I have walked in the light
and spoken in the light.

02:38:47.595 --> 02:38:51.178
Why now do you come
and take me like a thief in the night?

02:39:05.112 --> 02:39:09.359
His name is Jesus.
He comes from Nazareth in Galilee.

02:39:09.492 --> 02:39:13.536
He is here now charged
with the crimes of sedition,

02:39:13.663 --> 02:39:17.328
sorcery and blasphemy.

02:39:19.168 --> 02:39:23.830
Jesus of Nazareth, your crimes are
so many, I scarcely know where to begin.

02:39:24.507 --> 02:39:26.583
But before I do begin,

02:39:26.717 --> 02:39:31.344
is there any statement you would like
to make to these honourable men here?

02:39:34.850 --> 02:39:39.144
- Very well, then. Let us proceed.
- Let the first witness enter.

02:39:47.989 --> 02:39:51.073
Do you know this man Jesus of Nazareth?

02:39:51.951 --> 02:39:53.694
I do.

02:39:53.828 --> 02:39:57.410
Is he the one, then,
who used his sorcery on you?

02:39:58.582 --> 02:40:00.409
Sorcery?

02:40:01.335 --> 02:40:04.751
I don't know about sorcery.

02:40:04.880 --> 02:40:07.169
All I know is,

02:40:07.300 --> 02:40:10.170
I was blind and now I see.

02:40:12.221 --> 02:40:16.349
What did he do to you? How did
he give you the use of your eyes?

02:40:19.770 --> 02:40:23.768
If you knew where he came from,
you would know how he did it.

02:40:23.899 --> 02:40:26.651
We know where he came from.
He came from Galilee.

02:40:26.777 --> 02:40:29.862
So just answer the question, please.

02:40:31.907 --> 02:40:35.490
I have been blind
since the day of my birth.

02:40:38.550 --> 02:40:41.006
Jesus gave me sight.

02:40:42.012 --> 02:40:44.550
That's all I know.

02:40:44.681 --> 02:40:48.809
By your answer that
we do not know where he came from,

02:40:50.521 --> 02:40:56.107
are we to assume that
you believe... he was sent by God?

02:41:07.412 --> 02:41:10.117
I believe if God was not in him,

02:41:10.249 --> 02:41:14.460
he would not have been
able to make me see.

02:41:14.586 --> 02:41:18.666
But have you considered
that it is the Evil One in him,

02:41:18.799 --> 02:41:21.800
and the Evil One who made you see?

02:41:21.927 --> 02:41:24.169
But why?

02:41:25.264 --> 02:41:28.597
Why should the Evil One permit me,

02:41:28.725 --> 02:41:31.810
after so many years of darkness,

02:41:33.063 --> 02:41:37.191
to see the goodness
and the beauty of God's world?

02:41:41.822 --> 02:41:43.861
Take him out.

02:42:07.556 --> 02:42:09.714
Aren't you a friend of the Nazarene?

02:42:12.311 --> 02:42:13.971
Who?

02:42:14.104 --> 02:42:18.054
Jesus. The one they have in there.

02:42:19.276 --> 02:42:22.396
No. I don't know him.

02:42:23.030 --> 02:42:27.573
- But you're a Galilean.
- Should I know every Galilean, then?

02:42:36.376 --> 02:42:39.959
Sedition and sorcery
are not your only crimes.

02:42:41.381 --> 02:42:44.548
There is one far more horrendous
than either of those.

02:42:45.552 --> 02:42:48.090
You are charged with blasphemy.

02:42:50.390 --> 02:42:53.973
Will you favour us at least once
with your answer to this?

02:42:59.900 --> 02:43:02.605
Do you deny that you have blasphemed?

02:43:07.157 --> 02:43:10.277
Question those who have heard me.

02:43:10.410 --> 02:43:12.403
They know what I have said.

02:43:15.040 --> 02:43:18.207
You say to question those
who have heard you. I will indeed.

02:43:18.335 --> 02:43:22.333
- Many people will testify to your evil.
- What are you doing?

02:43:23.507 --> 02:43:25.713
Nicodemus, it's good to have you with us.

02:43:25.843 --> 02:43:29.591
Oh? Is that why I and
other members of the Sanhedrin

02:43:29.721 --> 02:43:33.137
have not been informed
of these proceedings?

02:43:33.267 --> 02:43:36.967
We had to move swiftly.
There was no time to notify everyone.

02:43:37.104 --> 02:43:39.143
No time?

02:43:39.273 --> 02:43:41.764
But I see Lord Sorak,
who lives in Emmaeus.

02:43:41.900 --> 02:43:45.020
I see Lord Annas,
who lives a farther distance than I.

02:43:45.153 --> 02:43:47.941
But you say there was
no time for Nicodemus,

02:43:48.073 --> 02:43:51.027
who lives right here in Jerusalem,

02:43:51.159 --> 02:43:54.326
who only lives a shouting distance
from this very place?

02:43:54.454 --> 02:44:00.457
Is my good friend
Joseph of Arimathea... present?

02:44:00.586 --> 02:44:03.290
No. I thought not.

02:44:03.422 --> 02:44:06.091
But many of the Sanhedrin aren't here.

02:44:06.216 --> 02:44:09.383
Yes. Yes, that is quite true, Lord Caiaphas.

02:44:09.511 --> 02:44:12.346
Those who think as I do are absent,

02:44:12.472 --> 02:44:15.260
and those who think
as you do are present.

02:44:15.392 --> 02:44:20.101
We are trying this man for blasphemy,
my Lord Nicodemus. Please be seated.

02:44:20.230 --> 02:44:22.555
I will not be seated.

02:44:22.691 --> 02:44:25.182
Are we...

02:44:25.319 --> 02:44:29.731
are we all Romans now,
that we disregard decency and justice,

02:44:29.865 --> 02:44:34.194
hold secret courts and
try innocent men in the dead of night?

02:44:34.307 --> 02:44:35.266
Nicodemus...

02:44:35.370 --> 02:44:39.748
What you are doing is unlawful,
Lord Caiaphas.

02:44:41.752 --> 02:44:45.002
This man is guilty of blasphemy,
Lord Nicodemus!

02:44:47.674 --> 02:44:50.296
Jesus of Nazareth, I adjure you,

02:44:51.929 --> 02:44:56.306
by the living God, by the Almighty,
that you tell us if you be the Christ,

02:44:56.433 --> 02:44:58.473
the Son of God.

02:45:05.859 --> 02:45:08.231
Are you the Christ?

02:45:10.531 --> 02:45:12.986
Are you the Son of God?!

02:45:15.994 --> 02:45:17.786
I am.

02:45:17.913 --> 02:45:20.155
- Blasphemy!
- Blasphemy!

02:45:20.415 --> 02:45:23.120
- Blasphemy!
- Blasphemy!

02:45:30.676 --> 02:45:33.297
Here's the order, sir, for your signature.

02:45:34.429 --> 02:45:38.973
What has he been found guilty of
that it cannot wait until a decent hour?

02:45:39.101 --> 02:45:41.770
He has been found guilty, sir, of sedition,

02:45:41.895 --> 02:45:46.107
sorcery, blasphemy and open rebellion.

02:45:58.996 --> 02:46:01.534
You claim to be the Son of God?

02:46:03.542 --> 02:46:06.496
Which one? Hm?

02:46:07.129 --> 02:46:08.920
Mars?

02:46:09.047 --> 02:46:11.087
Hercules? Jupiter?

02:46:13.177 --> 02:46:15.299
Which god are you the son of?

02:46:17.389 --> 02:46:19.845
The Lord our God is one.

02:46:21.435 --> 02:46:23.059
One?

02:46:23.187 --> 02:46:25.760
For all people?

02:46:25.898 --> 02:46:27.724
For Rome?

02:46:29.776 --> 02:46:32.314
All nations shall be gathered before him.

02:46:33.780 --> 02:46:36.485
He loves you no less than he loves others.

02:46:39.828 --> 02:46:42.366
Then why have I not known him?

02:46:45.792 --> 02:46:48.248
You have not looked for him.

02:46:51.590 --> 02:46:54.425
I am going to ask you -

02:46:54.551 --> 02:46:56.758
and before you answer,

02:46:56.887 --> 02:47:01.964
remember that I have the power
either to set you free

02:47:02.100 --> 02:47:04.638
or put you to death on the cross -

02:47:07.606 --> 02:47:11.604
if you are the son of your God, and king,

02:47:12.861 --> 02:47:17.155
where is your kingdom
that Rome hasn't heard of it?

02:47:17.282 --> 02:47:19.738
My kingdom is not of this world.

02:47:21.620 --> 02:47:23.613
Oh?

02:47:23.747 --> 02:47:26.285
Then what are you doing here?

02:47:28.836 --> 02:47:34.257
I came into this world
that I might give witness to what is true,

02:47:35.592 --> 02:47:40.135
and every man who loves the truth
listens to me.

02:47:47.479 --> 02:47:49.306
Truth?

02:47:53.986 --> 02:47:56.227
What is truth?

02:48:29.396 --> 02:48:32.065
I find no guilt in him.

02:48:32.191 --> 02:48:38.443
Galilee is Herod's province,
so take him to Herod. This is his business.

02:48:48.207 --> 02:48:50.033
Your Majesty?

02:49:08.852 --> 02:49:11.557
So you are the Jesus of Nazareth.

02:49:14.858 --> 02:49:17.396
I thought you might be John the Baptist,

02:49:19.238 --> 02:49:21.693
come back from the dead.

02:49:27.037 --> 02:49:30.702
I hear you perform miracles.

02:49:36.505 --> 02:49:39.589
I am told you do all manner of marvels,

02:49:40.676 --> 02:49:44.590
things which... defy reason.

02:49:47.307 --> 02:49:50.641
I do not believe
you can do any of these things.

02:49:53.272 --> 02:49:56.142
Let me see one of these miracles.

02:49:59.444 --> 02:50:01.271
Impostor.

02:50:02.114 --> 02:50:05.814
You cannot, but I can.

02:50:06.535 --> 02:50:10.402
Do you know that I, "The Fox",

02:50:10.539 --> 02:50:12.911
can raise one finger...

02:50:14.668 --> 02:50:17.206
and a man will lose his head?

02:50:50.746 --> 02:50:53.912
Now you are the king
you were born to be.

02:50:55.667 --> 02:50:57.625
"From you, Bethlehem,

02:50:58.962 --> 02:51:02.248
shall he come forth

02:51:02.382 --> 02:51:07.009
that is to be ruler in all Israel."

02:51:11.683 --> 02:51:13.343
- Pilate sent him to me?
- Yes.

02:51:13.477 --> 02:51:16.394
Pilate was loath to order
the execution of your subject.

02:51:16.522 --> 02:51:19.059
You're a liar. Pilate does not so favour me.

02:51:20.400 --> 02:51:22.440
Take him back.

02:51:30.244 --> 02:51:32.817
<i> For God so loved the world</i>

02:51:33.914 --> 02:51:37.164
<i>that he gave his only begotten son,</i>

02:51:38.544 --> 02:51:43.882
<i>that whosoever believeth in him</i>
<i>should not perish</i>

02:51:44.967 --> 02:51:48.383
<i>but should have everlasting life.</i>

02:52:13.871 --> 02:52:15.910
You're a friend of this Galilean's!

02:52:16.039 --> 02:52:18.577
You're mistaken! I don't know him!

02:52:58.874 --> 02:53:01.246
Hail, Pilate.

02:53:01.376 --> 02:53:03.416
Hail, Pilate.

02:53:17.142 --> 02:53:19.514
Behold the man!

02:53:30.697 --> 02:53:33.402
Crucify him!

02:53:33.534 --> 02:53:35.573
Crucify him.

02:53:36.995 --> 02:53:39.035
Release him!

02:53:40.916 --> 02:53:43.122
As your governor,

02:53:44.628 --> 02:53:47.499
I represent the responsibility of Rome.

02:53:49.466 --> 02:53:54.424
It is my duty to administer
her justice to these prisoners.

02:53:55.305 --> 02:54:01.640
This man has been brought here
as one who perverts the law.

02:54:02.563 --> 02:54:08.352
So this court will, therefore,
scourge and chastise him.

02:54:08.652 --> 02:54:10.858
- Release him!
- Crucify him!

02:54:11.280 --> 02:54:13.984
No!

02:54:24.668 --> 02:54:27.206
It is again my duty to remind you...

02:54:29.256 --> 02:54:32.173
that it is the benevolent custom of Rome

02:54:32.301 --> 02:54:34.839
to grant amnesty

02:54:34.970 --> 02:54:40.344
to one prisoner of your choosing...
on each anniversary of the Passover.

02:54:40.475 --> 02:54:44.058
Therefore, I will release unto you,

02:54:45.189 --> 02:54:49.815
completely free to go his way,
the prisoner of your choice.

02:54:51.904 --> 02:54:53.564
- Barabbas.
- Barabbas.

02:54:53.697 --> 02:54:55.737
Barabbas!

02:54:58.535 --> 02:54:59.614
No!

02:55:04.625 --> 02:55:07.198
Barabbas?

02:55:07.336 --> 02:55:11.380
Who is held on a charge of murder?
Him you want released?

02:55:11.507 --> 02:55:13.583
Give us Barabbas!

02:55:16.178 --> 02:55:18.005
No!

02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:42.532
Release him!

02:55:46.834 --> 02:55:50.452
- What shall I do with this man?
- Crucify him!

02:55:50.587 --> 02:55:52.414
Release him!

02:55:52.548 --> 02:55:54.754
He's a good man, the Nazarene.

02:55:54.883 --> 02:55:56.840
He walks in God's light.

02:55:56.969 --> 02:56:00.634
You're talking treason!
The man's a traitor!

02:56:00.764 --> 02:56:05.011
And you must be a traitor, too,
if you like him so much. Crucify him!

02:56:05.644 --> 02:56:08.978
- Crucify him!
- Save him!

02:56:14.194 --> 02:56:17.777
Have you no answer
for these things they accuse you of?

02:56:20.075 --> 02:56:23.159
Have you not one thing to say
in your own behalf?

02:56:31.670 --> 02:56:34.837
My kingdom is not of this world.

02:56:35.966 --> 02:56:37.377
Blasphemer!

02:56:37.509 --> 02:56:41.459
Any man who claims
to be a king is defying Caesar.

02:56:41.597 --> 02:56:44.218
We have no king but Caesar!

02:56:44.349 --> 02:56:48.429
- We have no king but Caesar!
- Hail, Caesar.

02:56:48.562 --> 02:56:50.768
Hail, Caesar!

02:56:50.898 --> 02:56:53.519
Crucify him! Crucify him!

02:56:59.239 --> 02:57:02.026
- Release him!
- Crucify him!

02:57:05.871 --> 02:57:09.038
We have no king but Caesar!

02:57:11.376 --> 02:57:13.416
It is ordered:

02:57:14.421 --> 02:57:16.959
To the cross with the prisoner.

02:57:28.310 --> 02:57:34.313
<i>Suffered under Pontius Pilate,</i>
<i>was crucified, dead and buried.</i>

02:59:20.506 --> 02:59:22.961
Do not weep for me.

02:59:25.344 --> 02:59:29.507
Weep for yourselves,
and for your children.

02:59:30.682 --> 02:59:34.810
For a time is coming when men will say

02:59:35.771 --> 02:59:41.358
"Blessed are the barren,
and the wombs that never bore a child."

02:59:42.736 --> 02:59:45.607
And they will say to the mountains

02:59:45.739 --> 02:59:47.981
"Fall on us,"

02:59:48.116 --> 02:59:50.904
and to the hills "Cover us."

02:59:53.038 --> 02:59:57.166
For if these things are done
when the wood is green,

02:59:58.085 --> 03:00:00.623
what will happen when it is dry?

03:05:06.977 --> 03:05:10.560
Father, forgive them,

03:05:11.940 --> 03:05:15.523
for they know not what they do.

03:05:22.451 --> 03:05:24.111
Mother!

03:05:28.665 --> 03:05:30.872
There is your son!

03:05:34.004 --> 03:05:36.460
There is your mother.

03:05:41.929 --> 03:05:47.089
He trusted in God.
Let God deliver him now.

03:05:48.101 --> 03:05:51.601
If you're the Son of God, save yourself.

03:05:53.190 --> 03:05:56.357
- Save us!
- We deserve our punishment.

03:05:58.237 --> 03:06:01.902
For us, it is justice.

03:06:03.200 --> 03:06:07.032
But this man has done nothing wrong.

03:06:10.958 --> 03:06:12.784
Jesus,

03:06:15.212 --> 03:06:18.795
remember me
when you come to your kingdom.

03:06:22.761 --> 03:06:25.632
I tell you this,

03:06:25.764 --> 03:06:27.591
today...

03:06:29.017 --> 03:06:33.015
you shall be with me in paradise.

03:06:56.795 --> 03:06:58.622
My God!

03:07:05.929 --> 03:07:08.681
My God!

03:07:08.807 --> 03:07:12.935
Why hast thou forsaken me?

03:07:42.716 --> 03:07:44.958
I thirst.

03:08:12.579 --> 03:08:14.619
It is finished.

03:08:37.771 --> 03:08:39.598
Father,

03:08:42.734 --> 03:08:45.190
into thy hands...

03:08:46.947 --> 03:08:51.075
I commit... my spirit.

03:09:26.069 --> 03:09:29.901
Truly, this man was the Son of God.

03:10:38.517 --> 03:10:43.226
It has been pointed out that Jesus
tread the path of prophecy. That is why...

03:10:43.355 --> 03:10:45.680
Your prophecies mean
nothing but trouble.

03:10:45.816 --> 03:10:49.399
That is why we are asking that
you place a guard around the tomb.

03:10:51.738 --> 03:10:54.739
A guard around a dead man's tomb?

03:10:54.867 --> 03:10:56.740
If his body is stolen in the night,

03:10:56.869 --> 03:11:00.403
the people will proclaim
that the prophecy has been fulfilled,

03:11:00.539 --> 03:11:02.994
that the Messiah has risen.

03:11:07.337 --> 03:11:08.535
Mm.

03:11:11.216 --> 03:11:13.838
Which of you is Joseph of Arimathea?

03:11:13.969 --> 03:11:15.926
I am.

03:11:16.054 --> 03:11:18.213
- This is your tomb?
- It is.

03:11:18.348 --> 03:11:22.476
- Has the Nazarene been laid there?
- By permission of your commander.

03:12:58.866 --> 03:13:02.733
<i> I have been wondering all night</i>
<i>about something. The prophecy...</i>

03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:06.073
<i> Don't talk to me</i>
<i>about prophecy!</i>

03:13:06.206 --> 03:13:08.531
<i>I've heard enough about prophecy.</i>

03:13:08.667 --> 03:13:11.288
When he is killed,

03:13:11.420 --> 03:13:15.714
after three days he will rise again.

03:13:15.841 --> 03:13:19.257
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the tomb, Thomas.

03:13:19.386 --> 03:13:21.094
Why?

03:13:37.279 --> 03:13:39.651
He is gone.

03:13:43.202 --> 03:13:46.037
Why seek ye the living among the dead?

03:13:46.163 --> 03:13:52.166
~ <i>And He shall reign for ever and ever</i>

03:13:55.881 --> 03:13:57.920
He is risen.

03:14:04.306 --> 03:14:07.722
He is risen. He is risen!

03:14:13.023 --> 03:14:15.146
~ <i>King of Kings</i>

03:14:15.275 --> 03:14:17.564
~ <i>For ever and ever</i>

03:14:17.694 --> 03:14:19.770
~ <i>Hallelujah, hallelujah!</i>

03:14:19.905 --> 03:14:22.610
~ <i>And Lord of Lords</i>

03:14:22.741 --> 03:14:25.066
~ <i>For ever and ever</i>

03:14:25.202 --> 03:14:27.574
~ <i>Hallelujah, hallelujah!</i>

03:14:27.704 --> 03:14:29.827
~ <i>And He shall reign...</i>

03:14:29.957 --> 03:14:32.626
He's gone.
The body disappeared in the night.

03:14:32.751 --> 03:14:35.372
- Are you sure?
- I saw for myself. The tomb is empty.

03:14:35.504 --> 03:14:38.754
- Did you question the soldiers?
- Yes. They saw nothing at all.

03:14:38.882 --> 03:14:40.875
- Were they asleep?
- They swear not.

03:14:41.009 --> 03:14:44.841
Of course they do. The Roman
punishment for sleeping on duty is death.

03:14:44.972 --> 03:14:47.011
Incredible.

03:14:47.140 --> 03:14:50.723
In any case, the whole thing
will be forgotten in a week.

03:14:52.000 --> 03:14:54.039
I wonder.

03:14:57.005 --> 03:15:03.339
~ <i>And He shall reign for ever and ever</i>

03:15:03.470 --> 03:15:07.218
~ <i>And He shall reign for ever...</i>

03:15:07.348 --> 03:15:12.224
Go now, and teach all nations.

03:15:15.315 --> 03:15:19.099
Make it your first care
to love one another,

03:15:19.235 --> 03:15:21.773
and to find the Kingdom of God,

03:15:22.322 --> 03:15:25.655
and all things shall be yours...

03:15:27.327 --> 03:15:29.948
without the asking.

03:15:30.455 --> 03:15:33.124
Do not fret, then, over tomorrow.

03:15:35.251 --> 03:15:38.620
Leave tomorrow
to fret over its own needs.

03:15:39.130 --> 03:15:41.337
For today,

03:15:41.466 --> 03:15:45.843
today's troubles are enough.

03:15:52.018 --> 03:15:56.645
And lo, I am with you always,

03:15:58.237 --> 03:16:01.857
even unto the end of the world.

03:16:03.363 --> 03:16:05.652
~ <i>For ever and ever</i>

03:16:05.907 --> 03:16:08.196
~ <i>For ever and ever</i>

03:16:08.326 --> 03:16:10.568
~ <i>Hallelujah, hallelujah!</i>

03:16:10.829 --> 03:16:13.035
~ <i>Hallelujah, hallelujah!</i>

03:16:14.290 --> 03:16:19.248
~ <i>Hallelujah!</i>
