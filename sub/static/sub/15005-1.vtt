00:24.481 --> 00:26.893
[Male narrator] Okay.
Settle down.

00:26.984 --> 00:28.724
Got your ears open?

00:30.362 --> 00:32.353
[Clears throat]

00:32.448 --> 00:35.565
This is the story of a sad flute

00:35.659 --> 00:38.526
a laughin' baby
and a weepin' sword.

00:46.211 --> 00:52.081
A long, long time ago
in a land far, far away,

00:52.176 --> 00:54.792
there lived a warrior...

00:54.887 --> 00:57.503
warrior with empty eyes.

02:33.694 --> 02:37.027
He'd trained his entire life
for one purpose.

02:39.616 --> 02:43.484
To be the greatest swordsman
in the history of mankind.

03:28.665 --> 03:31.577
He'd just achieved
his life's ambition,

03:31.668 --> 03:34.375
but his heart felt emptier
than ever.

03:37.674 --> 03:41.542
These two clans had been warrin'
for 500 years.

03:41.637 --> 03:44.595
And they vowed to keep on warrin'
until one of them

03:44.681 --> 03:47.093
didn't have a single man
left above Styx.

04:00.072 --> 04:01.733
[Giggles]

04:08.205 --> 04:10.491
[coos, cries]

04:15.712 --> 04:17.998
[coos, giggles]

04:18.089 --> 04:19.875
And so now, here he was,

04:19.966 --> 04:22.925
peerin' down
at this very last of his enemy.

04:23.011 --> 04:24.751
[Baby coos, laughs]

04:33.313 --> 04:36.476
When that
little warrior princess giggled,

04:36.566 --> 04:38.648
it did somethin' to him inside.

04:41.113 --> 04:42.853
But this was no time for feelin'.

05:12.728 --> 05:15.014
For when spared that baby's life,

05:15.105 --> 05:19.064
he put his name at the top
of his own clan's death list.

06:19.544 --> 06:23.787
With nothin' but the clothes on his back
and the baby in his arms,

06:23.882 --> 06:29.218
he decided to pay a visit to an old
warrior friend in a faraway land.

08:02.606 --> 08:04.016
Hey, Johnny.

08:05.650 --> 08:08.357
I don't like your stinkin' face.

08:08.445 --> 08:10.436
Easy, Ronald.

08:10.530 --> 08:14.114
The name's Eight-Ball.
Like in the game.

08:14.201 --> 08:16.442
Good luck for some,
bad luck for others.

08:16.536 --> 08:20.154
How can I assist you,
my friend from the mystical East?

08:23.793 --> 08:25.454
Uh-oh.

08:30.008 --> 08:32.215
Haven't been here
since Smiley kicked the bucket.

08:33.845 --> 08:36.631
Was a 3-day wait
just to get your shirts pressed.

08:41.686 --> 08:43.051
[Laughs]

08:43.145 --> 08:46.388
For a guy who cleaned sheets all day,
he sure liked to make a mess

08:46.483 --> 08:48.974
in the after-hours,
if you know what I mean.

08:50.904 --> 08:51.984
See you in the morning.

09:11.466 --> 09:14.003
[Man] You came to me
to be strong.

09:17.430 --> 09:20.388
I have made you the strongest.

09:24.396 --> 09:28.014
She will always be the enemy.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.202
[Baby crying in distance]

10:09.107 --> 10:11.644
[bellows]

10:19.659 --> 10:21.240
Here it is.

10:21.328 --> 10:23.364
Just rub some on your shoulder.

10:24.289 --> 10:27.281
Smiley's Oriental cure-all.
Works like a charm.

10:27.375 --> 10:28.410
[Crying]

10:28.501 --> 10:30.241
Now, honey,
I didn't forget about you.

10:31.838 --> 10:35.547
It's alright there. It's okay.
Ssh, ssh, ssh.

10:35.634 --> 10:39.923
Sorry about the tap I gave ya.
I thought you knew the sword.

10:40.013 --> 10:45.007
Smiley was always yabberin' on about
a guy who was gonna roll into town.

10:45.101 --> 10:49.686
But I shoulda figgered.
What do you call her?

10:49.773 --> 10:51.388
I do not know.

10:51.483 --> 10:53.815
Oh. She's not yours?

10:53.902 --> 10:55.984
Where's her folks?

10:56.071 --> 10:58.062
Dead.

11:08.249 --> 11:11.537
Oo-ee, best we find you
another diaper.

11:11.628 --> 11:12.868
Alright.

11:15.173 --> 11:17.505
Smiley like
your uncle or something?

11:17.592 --> 11:19.332
Friend.

11:19.427 --> 11:22.715
Well, if you were his friend,
maybe he would like for you

11:22.847 --> 11:24.087
to take over his laundry.

11:24.182 --> 11:27.925
-- Do not know how.
-- So I'll teach ya.

11:28.019 --> 11:29.975
I always done the laundry
around here.

11:30.063 --> 11:32.520
That's how I repaid Smiley
for teaching me the sword.

11:32.607 --> 11:35.314
Tell you what I'm gonna do.

11:35.402 --> 11:38.610
You stay here, I'll teach you how
to tie a diaper properly.

11:38.697 --> 11:41.939
We'll be partners, 60:40.
You are the 40.

11:43.326 --> 11:45.237
Alright now,
time to get to work.

11:48.540 --> 11:51.907
Dang, you're slower
than molasses in January.

11:57.298 --> 11:59.380
[Fly buzzing]

12:18.778 --> 12:20.985
You clean that real good,
yellow boy.

12:21.072 --> 12:23.233
As clean
as Snow White's panties--

12:23.324 --> 12:28.318
If I find the smallest bit
of condor crap on my fancy duds...

12:28.413 --> 12:32.952
-- Well, we gonna have us--
-- [crunch]

12:33.042 --> 12:36.079
Didn't I tell you I'd rip 'em off
if you don't watch yourself?

12:36.171 --> 12:37.206
Let go, evil midget!

12:37.297 --> 12:39.629
Come on, Eight-Ball,
we were just havin' us some fun.

12:39.716 --> 12:41.957
-- Really?
-- Ah! [Grunts]

12:42.051 --> 12:45.543
Okay... okay...
Let go.

12:45.638 --> 12:48.175
-- [Laughs]
-- Get outta here!

12:52.854 --> 12:55.311
How 'bout a home-cooked meal
for you and your little 'un?

12:59.569 --> 13:03.903
Once that Ferris wheel is finished,
it's gonna bring everybody rushin' back,

13:03.990 --> 13:07.528
And then we can take the word
"travelling" out of "travelling circus."

13:07.619 --> 13:09.234
Hey, Ron.

13:09.329 --> 13:13.072
[Slurring] Welcome to the
Eighth Wonder of the World!

13:13.166 --> 13:15.452
Get down here!
The chow bell ringin'!

13:22.008 --> 13:23.248
Ha!

14:04.175 --> 14:06.006
[Light applause]

14:06.094 --> 14:08.631
[woman] Bravo, bravo.

14:14.310 --> 14:16.221
[Laughs, applause]

14:19.983 --> 14:22.065
Gonna grab some vittles with us?

14:22.151 --> 14:24.392
No thanks.
Not hungry.

14:24.487 --> 14:28.196
I-I-I b-baked a cake.

14:31.202 --> 14:33.614
Come on, Ron!

14:33.705 --> 14:36.538
What the hell's up with her?

14:43.548 --> 14:47.461
You, I knew you was trouble the moment
you walked into this--

14:47.552 --> 14:49.543
[gurgles]

14:53.391 --> 14:56.007
[snores, laughter]

15:01.941 --> 15:04.899
[woman singing operatically]

15:31.054 --> 15:33.136
[squeals]

15:50.073 --> 15:52.280
Sounds even better from inside.

15:54.535 --> 15:57.618
[Singing continues]

16:01.125 --> 16:03.832
You ever seen
one of these before?

16:05.838 --> 16:10.002
The sound it's makin'?
It's called "opera."

16:10.093 --> 16:13.677
Day my poppa found his first chunk
of gold,

16:13.805 --> 16:16.137
he went out and bought this thing.

16:21.729 --> 16:24.141
Listen.
Here's my favorite part.

16:59.684 --> 17:04.098
[Narrator] So at the edge of the desert,
in a busted town full of broken people,

17:04.188 --> 17:10.058
the warrior began to learn stuff
he shoulda learned a long time ago.

17:10.153 --> 17:12.064
[Squishing]

17:22.498 --> 17:23.988
No, no! Rough!

17:26.669 --> 17:29.285
Like the joy
of gettin' dirty things clean.

17:35.344 --> 17:37.505
[Laughs]

17:42.185 --> 17:43.675
Yes!

17:47.774 --> 17:50.436
Woo hoo! That's me!
[Laughs] Thank you!

17:50.526 --> 17:53.188
I told you to aim at the line,
not at the coin!

17:53.279 --> 17:54.359
All right! [Laughs]

17:54.447 --> 17:57.484
He also learned the joy of losing.

17:57.575 --> 18:00.908
You're gonna need blood and bone of
about 100 dead buffaloes as fertilizer.

18:00.995 --> 18:03.281
Smiley always tried
to get something to grow.

18:03.372 --> 18:05.033
Never, ever lasted too long.

18:10.338 --> 18:13.205
He learned you could be happy
workin' with folks.

18:15.885 --> 18:18.843
And findin' the simple peace
in some private time

18:18.930 --> 18:21.342
after a hard day's work.

18:21.432 --> 18:23.093
[Door bell chimes]

18:23.184 --> 18:24.640
What's takin' you so long?

18:38.825 --> 18:41.692
Come on, Skinny!
You gonna miss it. Come on.

18:43.538 --> 18:45.620
[Door bell chimes, door closes]

18:52.130 --> 18:53.961
[train whistle blows]

18:54.048 --> 18:57.540
And he found that it's nice
to have a few friends around

18:57.635 --> 18:59.546
when the sun goes down.

19:07.145 --> 19:11.104
But most of all, the warrior learned
there's a heck of a lot more pleasure

19:11.190 --> 19:15.274
makin' things grow
than there is in cuttin' 'em down.

19:23.077 --> 19:25.489
[Laughter]

19:25.580 --> 19:27.821
You bunch of pups!
Gimme back that goddamn bottle!

19:38.885 --> 19:40.591
You win.
Show me what you got.

19:43.973 --> 19:46.806
God damn!
I shoulda never taught you this game!

19:46.893 --> 19:48.884
You a shark with a poker face.

20:11.876 --> 20:13.241
What happened to her?

20:38.319 --> 20:42.187
[Woman whimpers] Please!
Help me!

20:42.281 --> 20:44.146
-- Help me!
-- Lynne!

20:44.242 --> 20:47.484
-- Please! Let her go!
-- Someone, help me!

20:47.578 --> 20:50.411
-- Eight-Ball!
-- Lynne!

21:01.842 --> 21:02.957
[Man] Hungry?

21:05.346 --> 21:06.552
No?

21:34.959 --> 21:36.574
Pretty thing.

22:03.738 --> 22:05.603
Aagh!

22:05.698 --> 22:07.780
Agh! Aah!

22:13.456 --> 22:15.287
Damn you!

22:36.354 --> 22:37.685
[Pistol cocks]

22:43.361 --> 22:46.478
Noooo!

22:46.572 --> 22:49.609
[Grunting, crowd murmuring]

22:52.328 --> 22:55.161
No! Lynne! Lynne!

23:01.087 --> 23:02.372
Agh!

23:09.303 --> 23:11.385
No!

23:16.102 --> 23:17.717
[Woman sobs, gunshots]

23:17.812 --> 23:19.222
No!

23:39.250 --> 23:41.957
Only thing was,
when we went to bury her,

23:42.044 --> 23:43.454
she was still breathing.

23:44.713 --> 23:47.125
Never known nobody
that close to kickin' it.

23:48.884 --> 23:54.174
We didn't know what to do wit' her,
if'n she was gonna live or die.

23:54.265 --> 23:57.757
So we just put her in bed
and waited.

23:57.852 --> 24:00.685
Two days,
and she was eating soup.

24:00.771 --> 24:03.854
By the day three, she was already
sitting up somehow

24:03.941 --> 24:05.977
and slinging daggers
at the wall.

24:07.987 --> 24:09.147
But God ain't fair.

24:09.238 --> 24:12.571
And some people
just ain't cut out for the knife.

24:32.470 --> 24:36.429
Dang it.
My arm ain't worth a damn.

24:38.642 --> 24:40.178
It is not your arm.

24:47.193 --> 24:49.309
What'd you say?

24:49.403 --> 24:51.064
Ouch!

24:54.074 --> 24:55.359
Now you sure about this?

24:55.451 --> 24:58.158
'Cause I'm not so good
with my eyes open.

24:58.245 --> 25:00.156
Throw.

25:07.213 --> 25:08.703
I can't do it.

25:08.797 --> 25:11.630
Do not talk. Focus.

25:11.717 --> 25:13.924
It is your heart that shakes.

25:27.775 --> 25:29.106
You dead?

25:29.193 --> 25:30.399
Not yet.

25:51.632 --> 25:54.248
Sure you're not fountainin' blood
or anything, are ya?

25:57.429 --> 25:58.714
Oh, shit!

26:10.651 --> 26:13.518
[Laughs] Ha!

26:13.612 --> 26:14.897
I did it!

26:17.741 --> 26:19.732
Thank you,
Mr. Sad Flute.

26:22.454 --> 26:24.410
Smiley told me everything.

26:24.498 --> 26:26.534
I just taught you to focus.

26:39.263 --> 26:41.219
Why you do that?

27:24.475 --> 27:27.717
Okay.
I've always been dyin' to know.

27:27.811 --> 27:29.767
Why are y'all called
The Sad Flutes?

27:34.735 --> 27:37.852
So you got lady Sad Flutes,
too?

27:37.946 --> 27:40.232
Sad Flutinas or somethin'?

27:42.451 --> 27:44.112
Yes.

27:44.203 --> 27:47.320
Wow! That's nice.

27:47.414 --> 27:50.827
Jumpin' in the moonlight and kissin'

27:50.918 --> 27:55.002
as you both fly under the stars
to the tunes of The Sad Flutes--

27:55.089 --> 28:00.675
We are called Sad Flutes
because when you cut the throat,

28:00.761 --> 28:04.128
the last sound is like a sad flute.

28:06.225 --> 28:07.385
Dang!

28:07.476 --> 28:11.640
Skinny, sure know how to throw
a dead cat into a party room, don't ya?

28:17.444 --> 28:19.355
Why'd you become a Sad Flute?

28:23.117 --> 28:24.982
To be strong.

28:25.077 --> 28:26.283
That it?

28:32.668 --> 28:36.160
My father was working in the field.

28:36.255 --> 28:37.745
I was helping him.

28:39.842 --> 28:42.709
A swordsman came.

28:42.803 --> 28:44.384
Killed my father.

28:44.471 --> 28:47.713
Just to test his sword.

28:49.643 --> 28:51.884
That musta hurt you
somethin' bad.

28:51.979 --> 28:56.018
Not hurt. Angry.

28:56.108 --> 28:58.224
Course.

28:58.318 --> 29:00.229
No.

29:00.320 --> 29:04.279
I was angry at my father.

29:20.924 --> 29:24.633
Here. Take it.

29:24.720 --> 29:28.713
It's a present.
My momma gave it to me.

29:28.807 --> 29:33.597
She said, "If you hold it
over your heart when you're sad,

29:33.687 --> 29:35.928
it takes away all your sadness."

29:37.399 --> 29:40.232
It works.

29:40.319 --> 29:41.775
Kinda.

29:44.490 --> 29:45.775
Present?

29:45.866 --> 29:47.606
Yeah.

29:52.414 --> 29:54.496
[Footsteps approaching]

30:00.130 --> 30:02.621
[whimpers]

30:02.716 --> 30:05.298
[dog yips]

30:10.432 --> 30:13.014
That is your only friend here.

30:13.101 --> 30:15.092
Take good care of it.

30:15.187 --> 30:16.723
Yes, master.

30:24.780 --> 30:26.270
Oh, tarnations.

30:26.365 --> 30:28.856
Only to protect,
not kill.

30:28.951 --> 30:31.112
What am I gonna kill in this town,
an armadillo?

30:33.080 --> 30:34.741
Is that what I think it is?

30:51.682 --> 30:53.968
You've sealed it.

30:54.059 --> 30:56.300
So they cannot hear.

30:56.395 --> 30:58.602
Hear what?

30:58.689 --> 31:00.054
The weeping.

31:02.150 --> 31:05.938
Of all the souls I have taken.

31:09.491 --> 31:10.606
Who's listenin'?

31:10.701 --> 31:14.193
My past.

31:14.288 --> 31:15.824
And if it hears?

31:18.250 --> 31:19.911
No more music.

31:30.804 --> 31:33.295
This is a big country.
Where do we look?

31:36.310 --> 31:38.301
Do not look.

31:38.395 --> 31:41.137
We listen.

31:41.231 --> 31:42.812
He will show.

32:20.812 --> 32:23.554
Think of the sword
as part of the body.

32:24.399 --> 32:27.015
Like a finger.
Like a tooth.

32:27.110 --> 32:31.399
Rather think of it like metal
slicin' through a herd of buffalo!

32:38.205 --> 32:40.196
Show me what Smiley taught you.

32:51.510 --> 32:53.751
You do not have the power.

32:53.845 --> 32:57.008
Well, thank you very much.
I did not know that.

32:57.099 --> 32:58.589
But you are fast.

32:58.684 --> 33:01.221
Just have to be faster.

33:03.271 --> 33:04.602
Ouch!

Ouch! Is this 'cause of yesterday?
'Cause I said I was sorry!

33:10.070 --> 33:12.356
What? Cut it out, Skinny.
I'm serious!

33:12.447 --> 33:15.689
You are slower than molasses
in January.

33:15.826 --> 33:16.861

[Gunshots,

I once strung a man up
by his own hamstrings

up to you instead of the spics.

a whole lot more of me to like.

a thing or two.

51:29.085 --> 51:31.747
And while we're waiting,
I thought I should give you

That's right.
Lynne here smoked the wrong guy.

54:53.706 --> 54:56.698
Now the Colonel's coming back,
and he's bringing the whole damn family.

54:56.792 --> 55:00.000
We need the guy who did
that butcher job in the saloon.

55:00.087 --> 55:02.624
Well, I say
we all just pack up and leave.

55:02.715 --> 55:05.127
He's right! If you stay and fight,
you'll die like rats.

Well,
we'll die like rats with rifles.

Beth will understand.

55:25.863 --> 55:27.319
Follow me.

55:49.470 --> 55:52.758
I ruined everything.
Didn't I?

55:54.767 --> 55:56.632
You did what you had to do.

55:59.897 --> 56:03.685
You coulda just grabbed April
and hit the trail.

56:03.776 --> 56:05.812
But you didn't.

56:05.903 --> 56:10.488
Knowing saving me would ruin
every new thing you found here.

56:13.118 --> 56:17.578

and go and we're still breathin'.

That is the plan.

56:42.189 --> 56:44.521
Um...

56:44.608 --> 56:47.395
Maybe I could go with you?

56:52.116 --> 56:54.072
Just think about it, alright?

57:47.713 --> 57:48.873
Hey!

Yee-haw! Whoo!

58:29.671 --> 58:32.162
I knew what you was
from the get-go.

58:32.257 --> 58:35.420
Don't need to look
at the size of a man.

58:35.511 --> 58:37.843
I can smell the blood.

58:37.930 --> 58:40.012
It was on you, too.

58:42.643 --> 58:43.928
Yeah.

58:48.232 --> 58:49.642
Good.

58:49.733 --> 58:52.395
Now,
get my jacket clean if you can.

58:52.486 --> 58:55.603
If I'm gonna die,
I want to look good doing it.

58:55.697 --> 58:57.403
Why die?

58:57.491 --> 59:00.324
'Cause we only got about a hundred
sticks of dynamite and a few weapons.

That ain't much more
'n to sting them with.

You also have that.

Done a good job on this garden.
Well, for a laundry man.

59:35.237 --> 59:38.149
You do a good shooting.

59:38.240 --> 59:41.232
-- For a drunken man.
-- [Chuckles]

59:41.326 --> 59:42.987
Why you stopped the shooting?

59:43.078 --> 59:48.869
Well, I just went around
robbing banks, hitting trains

59:48.959 --> 59:54.579
till I ran into the only force
that can truly bring down any outlaw.

01:00:01.388 --> 01:00:03.970
When I was with her,
I didn't wanna run.

01:00:07.686 --> 01:00:09.392
What happened then?

01:00:09.479 --> 01:00:13.222
There was a couple of Rangers
who hadn't forgot about me.

One of 'em found Beth.

01:00:26.163 --> 01:00:31.248
Last thing she ever said to me was,
"Don't never pick up no gun again."

01:00:32.336 --> 01:00:35.248
So far...

01:00:35.339 --> 01:00:38.046
Well, at least till today...

01:00:38.133 --> 01:00:40.124
I done what she asked.

01:00:42.554 --> 01:00:47.514
But for fellas like me and you,
we are what we are.

01:00:50.103 --> 01:00:55.348
If you truly love somethin'
or somebody, Laundry Man...

01:00:55.442 --> 01:00:59.355
you get as far away
from 'em as possible.

01:00:59.446 --> 01:01:03.280
'Cause we're sand.
