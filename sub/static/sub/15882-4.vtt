00:02.086 --> 00:03.878
- Now I know
this plan is foolproof.

00:04.004 --> 00:05.713
Check this out.

00:05.839 --> 00:10.093
First of all, you and me
start working at the bank.

00:10.219 --> 00:11.552
Doesn't matter
the position, okay,

00:11.679 --> 00:13.471
just so long as we get
in there, all right?

00:13.597 --> 00:15.765
Then we just
go there every day,

00:15.891 --> 00:18.518
do the work,
gain their trust

00:18.644 --> 00:21.145
until we get them
in the palm of our hand.

00:21.271 --> 00:24.232
- All right.
So how we get the money?

00:24.358 --> 00:26.234
- That's the beauty
of it, bro.

00:26.360 --> 00:30.154
They deposit the money
into our bank accounts,

00:30.280 --> 00:32.490
week after week,
month after month.

00:32.616 --> 00:34.951
They're not even gonna know
they're being robbed.

00:35.077 --> 00:38.162
And then 20
or 30 years later,

00:38.288 --> 00:43.960
we walk out the front door
like nothing even happened.

00:46.797 --> 00:50.049
- Motherfucker,
that's called a job!

- Hello.

01:17.786 --> 01:19.036
Good evening.

01:19.163 --> 01:20.371
- Thank you.

01:20.497 --> 01:22.290

Uh, I am Keegan.

[Cheering]

01:29.047 --> 01:30.423
Now, Keegan and I
have noticed

01:30.549 --> 01:32.133
that there, uh, seems
to be a huge difference

01:32.259 --> 01:33.634
between white college movies
and black college movies.

01:33.761 --> 01:34.802
- It's huge, yes.

01:34.928 --> 01:36.429
In... in white
college movies...

01:36.555 --> 01:39.182
white college movies are always
only about having fun,

01:39.308 --> 01:41.893
smoking weed,
and stealing mascots.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.061
- Right, and it's all about...

with date rape!
Both: [guitar-wail impression]

01:54.072 --> 01:56.365
- And in black college movies,
the... the lead always

01:56.492 --> 01:57.992
says this line,
every time:

01:58.118 --> 02:01.329
- "I'm gonna go
to college."

02:01.455 --> 02:03.206
Toward the beginning
of the film, "I'm gonna go"...

02:03.332 --> 02:04.999
as if someone
just told him,

02:05.125 --> 02:07.376
"There's no way you're
gonna go to college, man."

02:07.503 --> 02:08.795
- [Laughing]
- "I'm gonna go."

02:08.921 --> 02:11.130
That's the plot
of the film right there.

02:11.256 --> 02:12.757
That this guy's
gonna go to college.

02:12.883 --> 02:13.925
- And in a white college movie,
it... it... it...

02:14.051 --> 02:15.218
uh, college
is a given.

02:15.344 --> 02:16.969
College is a backdrop.
- Oh, yeah.

02:17.095 --> 02:18.846
- It's about "How do I get
out of college?"

02:18.972 --> 02:20.306
- That's right, "How do I do
as little work as possible?"

02:20.432 --> 02:21.933
- "Aw, man, I'm sick
of this trust fund

02:22.059 --> 02:25.686
and my dad
being a legacy."

02:25.813 --> 02:30.316
Both: [guitar-wail impression]

02:30.442 --> 02:32.944
- No, black college movies,
always the same plot:

02:33.070 --> 02:34.946
"I might develop
a challenging, rhythmical,

02:35.072 --> 02:37.031
extracurricular activity"...
- Mm-hmm.

02:37.157 --> 02:38.699
- "That's not gonna change
the fact that I'm going

02:38.826 --> 02:41.494
to stay in college."
- Mm-hmm.

02:41.620 --> 02:42.954
It's gonna be all right,
brother, 'cause there ain't

02:43.080 --> 02:44.664
nobody gonna try to kick you out
of college.

02:44.790 --> 02:48.125
It's a black college.
You're gonna be fine.

02:48.252 --> 02:49.710
- I don't understand,
when is gonna be the day

02:49.837 --> 02:51.504
that we can have
a college movie for black people

02:51.630 --> 02:52.797
where we get
to act like fools?

02:52.923 --> 02:54.048
- I'll tell you this
right now:

02:54.174 --> 02:55.716
When a black man dresses
like a woman

02:55.843 --> 02:57.885
in order to live
in a sorority house,

02:58.011 --> 02:59.637
we will have reached equality.

No, actually, that...
no, that movie exists.

You wanna keep doing this shit?

yo, be careful.

That's what's up!

- Straight down the middle, son!

- You can't go back
to middle now, son.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.162
- What?
- We already committed

04:06.288 --> 04:08.831
to the upside-down
and to the side.

04:08.957 --> 04:13.377
- I got you, dog, yeah!
- Ahh!

04:13.503 --> 04:14.962
What are you doing, man?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.756
- You said upside-down
and to the side.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.132
- That's three omegas!

04:18.258 --> 04:19.800
- Oh, man,
I forgot the Pi.

04:19.927 --> 04:24.388
Yeah!
- Ahh!

04:24.514 --> 04:28.893
Oh...

04:29.019 --> 04:30.645
- Oh, man,
I mean, you know...

04:30.771 --> 04:32.605
that... that, man...
that... that...

04:32.731 --> 04:33.773
that could be
a rocket ship,

04:33.899 --> 04:38.110
or... or
a lighthouse.

04:38.236 --> 04:40.571
Naw, man, you straight up
got a dick on your chest.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.574
- Ahh!

04:46.370 --> 04:48.287
- What do we do?

04:48.413 --> 04:50.498
They told us at the station
to come down here and fill time,

04:50.624 --> 04:53.626
but, uh, there's
no story here.

04:53.752 --> 04:56.128
- In this neighborhood,
there's always a story.

04:56.254 --> 04:58.547
Here, gimme the name
of a mythical creature.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.007
- Mythical creature?
I don't...

05:00.133 --> 05:01.592
- Trust me.
- Uh, I don't... a pegasus.

05:01.718 --> 05:02.927
- Pegasus, perfect.

05:03.053 --> 05:07.348
Just roll,
watch, and learn.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.016
- They can stay in my house
if they want to...

05:09.142 --> 05:10.977
- Hi, there. Rick Nicholsby,
Channel Six News.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.104
We've had reports
of a pegasus in the area.

05:13.230 --> 05:14.438
Has anybody seen
anything like that?

05:14.564 --> 05:16.524
- Aw, yeah, man,
I seen a pegasus.

05:16.650 --> 05:19.318
I seen it, yeah, every day.
- I sees it too, man.

05:19.444 --> 05:21.028
We both see
that pegasus, dog.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.030
- Yeah, I saw it
with my own two eyes, man.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.907
That horse had
a big old snake head...

05:25.033 --> 05:27.451
- Naw, man, it ain't
got no snake head, fool.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.578
Y'all, that... that horse
had some big wings, man.

05:29.705 --> 05:30.913
- Yeah, yeah.
- It's all flying and shit.

05:31.039 --> 05:32.373
- Yeah, that horse
had big old wings.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.125
Man, like, two sets
of wings, yeah.

05:34.251 --> 05:36.002
Y'all see the pegasus?
All: Yeah.

05:36.128 --> 05:38.504
- Everybody up in here
seen the pegasus, man.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.756
- Curiosity has brought out
large crowds

05:40.882 --> 05:44.010
to see the alleged pegasus in
this South Lennox neighborhood.

05:44.136 --> 05:45.344
- Look, there it is.

05:45.470 --> 05:48.848
- I'm gonna find it,
break it,

05:48.974 --> 05:51.434
and then ride it
to the pegasus treasure.

05:51.560 --> 05:54.478
- Residents say the creature
resembles this amateur sketch.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.063
- Kicked the fuck
out of my car.

05:56.189 --> 05:57.732
City's gotta pay
for that shit too.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.026
I ain't got no coverage
for no pegasus, bitch.

06:00.152 --> 06:01.235
- He land on my roof, man.
Look at my roof, man.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.486
He busted it up.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.280
He busted
the whole thing up, man.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.407
Yeah, he been... he been... he been
sitting up there every day.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.284
- While many revel
in the possibility

06:08.410 --> 06:09.785
of seeing
the winged horse,

06:09.911 --> 06:12.288
others are not
so welcoming.

06:12.414 --> 06:14.749
- I just know this neighborhood
would be better

06:14.875 --> 06:17.126
if that pegasus
is put down.

06:17.252 --> 06:20.504
- I tell you this: God ain't
putting no wings on no horse.

06:20.630 --> 06:23.299
- Now, see, if this was
a white neighborhood,

06:23.425 --> 06:25.259
animal control
would be up in here

06:25.385 --> 06:27.303
with a pegasus trap.
- That's right.

06:27.429 --> 06:31.182
They can't take our pegasus.
This is our pegasus.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.475
- Pegasus up
in this motherfucker!

06:32.601 --> 06:33.976
- Hey, man, why you
interrupting me?

06:34.102 --> 06:35.144
I'm trying to talk
about the pegasus.

06:35.270 --> 06:36.771
- Fuck you!
- Hey!

06:36.897 --> 06:39.940
Don't be disrespecting pegasus!
- I love pegasus!

06:42.486 --> 06:45.154
- Yes, we're here live
on the scene in South Lennox,

06:45.280 --> 06:48.324
where riots have broken out
over the alleged appearance

06:48.450 --> 06:50.576
of a flying horse.

06:54.664 --> 06:55.956
- Did this
actually happen?

06:56.083 --> 06:58.959
Did Mel Gibson actually say
to that woman...

06:59.086 --> 07:01.962
- His... uh, not just a woman,
his wife or girlfriend.

07:02.089 --> 07:04.090
- Right, whatever she was.
Did he say to her,

07:04.216 --> 07:07.301
"I hope you get raped
by a pack of niggers"?

07:07.427 --> 07:08.969
- Yes, he did.
- What?

07:09.096 --> 07:12.348
- He is the most racist man
in the world, yes.

07:12.474 --> 07:15.434
- But, seriously, no...
and, for the record,

07:15.560 --> 07:17.144
if... if he had said,

07:17.270 --> 07:19.271
"I hope you get raped by a pack
of African-Americans"...

07:19.397 --> 07:20.898
- Not better, not better.
- Doesn't fix it.

07:21.024 --> 07:23.651
Doesn't even fix it,
it's that racist.

07:23.777 --> 07:27.071
- Because "pack" always
denotes non-human.

07:27.197 --> 07:28.989
- It means animals.
- It means animals every time.

07:29.116 --> 07:31.200
- No, I-I would've
rather he said, uh,

07:31.326 --> 07:33.369
"I hope you get raped
by a group of niggers."

07:33.495 --> 07:34.537
- Mm-hmm.
- Uh...

07:34.663 --> 07:36.539
"A, uh, gathering of niggers"

07:36.665 --> 07:37.706
would have been fine.

07:37.833 --> 07:39.917
- "Congregation."

07:40.043 --> 07:41.293
- A congre... please.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.004
[Applause]

07:44.131 --> 07:45.840
No, but it's,
like, a pack.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.299
"Pack" is the most
racist thing

07:47.425 --> 07:48.801
I've ever heard anyone say
in my life.

07:48.927 --> 07:50.761
- I would rather someone say,
"You got raped

07:50.887 --> 07:52.179
by a group of niggers,"

07:52.305 --> 07:54.640
than "A pack
of African-Americans

07:54.766 --> 07:56.433
went to a physics
presentation."

07:56.560 --> 07:58.352
- Yes, yes.
[Laughter]

07:58.478 --> 08:00.229
Right?
- I would be less offended.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.525
- Hey, did you
see that nigga?

08:04.651 --> 08:07.027
- That nigga
looked like Busta Rhymes

08:07.154 --> 08:09.280
and Maya Angelou
had a baby.

08:09.406 --> 08:11.866
All: [laughing]
- Yeah, yeah.

08:11.992 --> 08:15.202
That was
one jacked-up-looking nigger.

08:15.328 --> 08:19.832
[Nervously laughing]

08:19.958 --> 08:22.168
- Uh-oh.
You just dropped the N-word,

08:22.294 --> 08:24.211
but you're not an "N."

08:24.337 --> 08:26.922
Lucky for you, there's a way
to avoid these situations.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.465
Introducing
the new smartphone application:

08:28.592 --> 08:29.967
The negraph.

08:30.093 --> 08:32.178
Finally, a technology
specifically designed

08:32.304 --> 08:35.389
to help you determine whether
or not you can drop the N-bomb.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.682
- I can say it!

08:36.808 --> 08:39.226
All: We can
all say it!

08:39.352 --> 08:41.395
- Not in this lifetime.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.856
- To see your negraph,
just enter your name,

08:43.982 --> 08:45.858
age, and color
of your skin,

08:45.984 --> 08:48.819
or just the color
of your skin.

08:48.945 --> 08:52.406
- I've got the negraph
on my phone and my iPad.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.408
My phone says
I can't ever say it.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.994
