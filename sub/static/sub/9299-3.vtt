Why would someone put ag-lime on her?

and masks the odor.

- There are ligature marks.

- So she was strangled.
- Well, I didn't say that.

06:57.491 --> 07:00.526
I did.
Well, how long has she been dead?

07:00.560 --> 07:02.261
Well, the ag-lime is
gonna make it difficult

07:02.275 --> 07:03.909
to determine post-mortem interval.

07:03.944 --> 07:05.744
It was poured on her
within an hour of her death.

killed in the church.

07:08.448 --> 07:10.816
It doesn't say that to me.

07:10.850 --> 07:12.618
Well, a murderer isn't
going to strangle her

07:12.652 --> 07:14.286
and then drag her all the way
in here, dump her in there,

07:14.321 --> 07:16.155
then run all the way back
out and get the ag-lime.

07:16.189 --> 07:17.389
Bet we'll find ag-lime on the grounds.

11:10.120 --> 11:13.289
Hmm. It's possible.
Similar bone structure.

11:13.356 --> 11:18.194
Okay, uh, we'll go out on a limb here.
The woman with her ...

11:18.228 --> 11:21.931
so dangerous to make wild leaps ...
is it her babysitter?

11:21.965 --> 11:24.367
You're not going to make
me say that it's her mother.

11:24.401 --> 11:26.869
[ chuckles ]
I think she just did.

11:28.072 --> 11:31.708
Uh, there's something
dried on her pants.

11:31.743 --> 11:34.277
Mm. I'll have Susie test it.

11:34.778 --> 11:38.047
- There's a receipt in her pocket.
- Maura: For what?

11:38.082 --> 11:39.882
I don't know. It's faded.

11:39.917 --> 11:42.886
Thermal paper doesn't use
ink. Fades immediately.

11:42.953 --> 11:44.988
I'll have the crime lab look at it.

11:45.023 --> 11:47.592
Her shirt and her pants
are both Off-93 apparel.

11:47.626 --> 11:49.794
That's a pretty common brand.
I-I can track it, though.

11:49.829 --> 11:53.265
- Yeah, do that.
- Oh, a tattoo.

11:53.366 --> 11:56.202
<i>Oh, the tissue is inflamed.</i>

11:56.236 --> 11:58.672
It was done within
eight hours of her death.

11:58.706 --> 12:01.875
It's homemade. Whoever did
it used a ballpoint pen.

12:01.909 --> 12:04.945
Maybe she just got out of
prison or it's a gang tattoo.

12:04.979 --> 12:06.947
Want me to track it through
the gang tattoo database?

12:06.981 --> 12:10.617
Considering it's the only tattoo
database we've have, yes, please.

12:10.652 --> 12:13.287
I live to float. [ sighs ]

12:15.056 --> 12:16.156
[ door closes ]

12:16.224 --> 12:17.725
I'll scan her prints,

12:17.759 --> 12:20.828
but I'm not optimistic
unless she was arrested.

12:25.400 --> 12:29.637
Even if she was a
gang-banger, she has a mother.

12:29.672 --> 12:32.941
[ indistinct conversations ]

12:32.975 --> 12:38.079
Jane: Hi. I think this is our
victim. How old does she look to you?

12:38.114 --> 12:41.783
- Seven, maybe?
- Did you run her prints?

12:41.817 --> 12:44.953
Frost: No hits. I'll get an
X-ray of her skull from dr. Isles

12:44.987 --> 12:46.821
and use this photo and do
a computer age progression.

12:46.855 --> 12:48.756
I ran a check on the sexual offenders

12:48.791 --> 12:50.792
that live near the church ...
there's a half a dozen of them.

12:50.827 --> 12:53.361
I don't think we're looking for a
sexual offender. She wasn't raped.

12:53.395 --> 12:54.829
Is this everybody with
keys to the church?

12:54.863 --> 12:57.298
- Or access to them, yeah.
- Any of these guys have a record?

12:57.333 --> 12:59.901
I'll call the Vatican and see
what Father Crowley's been up to.

12:59.936 --> 13:03.338
He's a good suspect.
He hates everybody, especially Tommy.

13:03.406 --> 13:07.108
- How was the christening?
- Oh, think of your worst family holiday,

13:07.143 --> 13:09.143
- and multiply by ten.
- Oh, I'm sorry, Jane.

13:09.178 --> 13:12.047
Well, Sal Perez did five
years for a string of B&E's.

13:12.081 --> 13:14.115
Maybe our victim caught him
stealing something from the church?

13:14.183 --> 13:15.817
Yeah, check and see
if anything's missing.

13:15.851 --> 13:19.320
Oh, Frankie came by.
No hits on that tattoo.

13:19.354 --> 13:22.990
He seems to be taking the
new assignment pretty well.

13:23.025 --> 13:25.993
You think this budget-cut
story is accurate?

13:26.027 --> 13:27.794
I heard it could happen.

13:27.829 --> 13:29.897
Yeah, but they're not gonna
make cuts in homicide, are they?

13:29.931 --> 13:31.832
[ scoffs ]
I don't count on anything.

13:31.867 --> 13:34.402
Mayor White laid off
250 cops in the '80s.

13:34.470 --> 13:37.005
I was out for a year.

13:38.508 --> 13:40.175
[ both chuckle ]

13:40.209 --> 13:42.210
You were a Shorty Pasquale pizza boy?

13:42.245 --> 13:44.212
I had to pay the rent.
[ cellphone vibrates ]

13:44.246 --> 13:46.815
I keep this to remind
myself to be grateful.

13:47.149 --> 13:49.851
All right, Maura's got something.

13:53.422 --> 13:58.793
Evidence of two spiral fractures ...
right radius and left ulna.

13:58.828 --> 14:01.196
So, two people held her
down and broke both her arms.

14:01.230 --> 14:04.099
That's one possible scenario.
The fractures are small.

14:04.133 --> 14:06.134
It happened within
24 hours of her death.

14:06.529 --> 14:08.893
That's not enough, Maura. I need
an hour when she died.

14:09.013 --> 14:11.215
Well, adline makes that impossible. {*cor}

14:12.861 --> 14:16.344
Jane, if I can't narrow down the
time of death, you certainly can't.

14:16.379 --> 14:21.349
- Strawbridge, Strawberry...
- Are you doing what I think you're doing?

14:21.384 --> 14:24.019
How did you know I'm looking at porn?

14:24.053 --> 14:27.122
No, wait, I logged in as you,
so Dr. Isles is looking at porn.

14:27.156 --> 14:29.357
Oh. What?! Move over.

14:29.392 --> 14:34.129
Oh, I guess it's all right
to be looking up Stuart.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.298
He's a home wrecker. Look.

15:00.422 --> 15:02.756
Yeah, Strawberry's a stable guy.

15:02.790 --> 15:07.126
He seems nice. He's got a job.
T.J. could do worse.

15:08.228 --> 15:10.463
Tommy couldn't even fill
out his papers, Jane.

15:10.497 --> 15:13.266
Yeah, but he loves T.J.,
Frankie. And so do we.

15:14.468 --> 15:16.236
There's only one thing we can do.

15:16.303 --> 15:18.371
Please don't suggest
kidnapping to two cops.

15:18.405 --> 15:21.941
We need to get Tommy
and Lydia back together.

15:23.110 --> 15:26.512
Okay, but they never were "together."

15:26.580 --> 15:28.648
Tommy had a one-night stand
and then introduced Lydia ...

15:28.682 --> 15:30.483
I don't care.

15:30.518 --> 15:34.121
I will do whatever I have to
do to get my grandbaby back,

15:34.155 --> 15:38.359
especially since neither
one of you are making any.

15:38.427 --> 15:41.028
Ma! Ma.

15:41.130 --> 15:45.566
- I know Tommy likes Lydia.
- What, did he tell you that?

15:45.600 --> 15:47.435
Didn't have to. She likes
him, too. That's why they

15:47.436 --> 15:49.270
act like 7th-graders when
they're around each other.

15:49.304 --> 15:50.371
Are you sure that's not a brain problem?

15:50.438 --> 15:52.106
- Jane.
- What?

15:52.140 --> 15:55.243
Well, what if we got the
two of them together ...

15:55.277 --> 15:57.011
I mean, in the same place.

15:57.046 --> 15:58.679
Well, so, what, we're
in "the parent trap" now?

- Oh, that's a great idea.
- What ... what are you doing? Frankie.

Hey, Lydia. It's Frankie.
Jane asked me to call you.

16:08.656 --> 16:11.525
No. Uh-huh.
Well, she feels really bad

and I'll get Tommy there.

- I can't take any more bad news today.
- It's a letter from the brass.

- They're saying there might be layoffs.
- What?

16:56.873 --> 17:00.108
We might be "reallocated"?
What does that mean?

17:00.143 --> 17:03.078
Might put us back in uniform,
add 911 calls to the job.

17:03.112 --> 17:05.113
- Can they do that?
- Yeah.

17:05.147 --> 17:07.214
At least yours won't suggest
you take early retirement.

the nose a little bit and take

- Uh, a dry iron and U.V. light.

me any questions and trust me.

22:50.049 --> 22:54.720
So smart, so sweet.

22:54.755 --> 22:58.457
She was accepted into every
college she applied to.

22:58.491 --> 22:59.392
Why didn't she go?

23:02.396 --> 23:04.864
Look, we don't care
about your status, okay?

23:04.898 --> 23:10.703
- We care about your daughter.
- She didn't get to go to college

23:10.738 --> 23:13.406
because she couldn't
take the scholarships

23:13.474 --> 23:16.143
- once they knew...
- That she was undocumented.

23:17.946 --> 23:19.846
Help us find her killer.

23:19.881 --> 23:25.018
- We need a list of her friends.
- They all went off to college...

23:25.052 --> 23:28.889
and left her behind
to work in a factory,

23:28.923 --> 23:32.326
- like her mother.
- Did Isabella have a boyfriend?

23:34.896 --> 23:37.697
I don't know.

23:37.765 --> 23:39.232
[ voice breaking ]
I don't think so.

[ knock on door ]

23:41.435 --> 23:43.169
Hi.

23:43.203 --> 23:46.939
Um, this is our chief medical
examiner, Dr. Maura Isles.

23:49.175 --> 23:51.043
I am terribly sorry to tell you

23:51.111 --> 23:53.478
that your daughter was
four weeks' pregnant.

23:57.016 --> 23:59.017
[ crying ] Oh, Dios...

24:02.522 --> 24:04.990
<i>Dios...</i>

24:06.226 --> 24:07.760
I'm so sorry.

24:13.133 --> 24:15.068
Can you tell us what this tattoo means?

24:19.190 --> 24:23.794
- Four Corners.
- The Four Corners gang?

24:23.828 --> 24:27.131
We both worked Four Corners drug
cases. Never saw one like that.

24:27.165 --> 24:31.869
- We found the same mark on your daughter.
- It's only for the chosen few ...

24:31.903 --> 24:35.106
special girls the gang
leaders want for themselves.

24:35.140 --> 24:36.808
Did you know that your
daughter was in a gang?

24:36.842 --> 24:38.276
She wasn't in a gang.

24:38.311 --> 24:41.046
Four Corners took her,
and they killed her.

24:41.081 --> 24:42.648
Why do you say that?

24:42.682 --> 24:45.551
Once that mark is on you,
you're their property.

24:45.585 --> 24:49.122
They kill you if you leave
before they're done with you.

24:49.189 --> 24:54.961
Ay, Dios,
my poor girl.

24:55.028 --> 24:57.997
We're gonna do everything we can
to find your daughter's killer.

24:58.031 --> 25:01.668
[ crying ] I know you will.

25:01.702 --> 25:04.837
You brought her home to me.

25:11.712 --> 25:14.814
I asked Maura to look up that
tattoo in old autopsy photos,

25:14.849 --> 25:17.217
see if maybe there were any
victims before she was the M.E.

25:17.251 --> 25:20.688
That's a good idea.
Isabella's mother said

25:20.722 --> 25:22.189
the Four Corners would kill
a girl who tried to leave.

25:22.224 --> 25:24.742
Isabella didn't have time
to leave. She was killed

25:24.743 --> 25:27.261
the same day they inked her.
Something else happened.

25:27.296 --> 25:32.200
Jane, I think I found what you're
looking for in the archives.

25:32.234 --> 25:36.238
Frost, can you look up a cold case ...
Araceli Ramirez?

25:36.272 --> 25:39.574
There might be more. I
just went back through 2004.

25:39.642 --> 25:44.112
Araceli Ramirez was killed
near Four Corners in 2004.

25:44.146 --> 25:45.347
All three suspects were gang members.

25:45.381 --> 25:49.351
- Where are those suspects today?
- Two are in prison. One dead.

25:49.385 --> 25:52.654
Isabella clocks in for work
at 7:00 A.M.

25:52.688 --> 25:55.723
Goes to the Bodega during
lunch, works until 4:00.

25:55.758 --> 25:57.258
Did Frankie say if there
was a bathroom in the Bodega?

25:57.359 --> 26:00.728
- Yeah, in the back.
- So, Isabella takes a full hour for lunch.

26:00.762 --> 26:03.097
Maybe she takes the pregnancy
test in the store bathroom.

26:03.198 --> 26:04.899
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.

26:04.933 --> 26:07.101
And what does an 18-year-old
practicing catholic girl

26:07.135 --> 26:09.169
with no money do when she
finds out she's pregnant?

26:09.237 --> 26:12.305
- She definitely doesn't have an abortion.
- She talks to a friend.

26:12.373 --> 26:15.875
Yeah. And Isabella didn't have a
cellphone, so maybe it was a work friend.

26:15.910 --> 26:17.310
Maybe someone with ties to Four Corners.

26:17.345 --> 26:19.780
Let's pull employee
records and run them.

26:19.848 --> 26:22.282
Frost, look for any Off-93
employee who has gang affiliations.

26:22.317 --> 26:26.052
- Oh, my god. It's 6:30, Jane.
- So?

26:26.087 --> 26:28.154
So, at 7:00, people are
showing up at your apartment.

26:28.189 --> 26:30.890
- Oh, my god. I totally forgot.
- Go. We got this.

It's not a problem. I love to cook.

- Oh, yes, she is.

Yes, you are a good
doggie. Oh, yes, you are.

26:52.680 --> 26:56.283
So, how fun that you
are moving to Abilene.

26:56.317 --> 27:02.990
You can go to the rodeo, and ...
and celebrate the pioneer spirit,

27:03.024 --> 27:05.225
and, you know, what
else are you gonna do?

27:05.260 --> 27:10.364
I just can't wait to fill a house
with doggies and kittens and babies.

27:17.304 --> 27:21.674
Oh. Only you and Tommy
can get her to do that.

27:21.708 --> 27:24.377
She doesn't do that for anybody else.

27:24.411 --> 27:28.747
Yeah. Tommy and T.J. would, you know,
play with her and take her for walks.

27:28.781 --> 27:31.783
It will be so sad that
Tommy can't do that anymore.

27:31.851 --> 27:35.320
Yeah... that is sad.

27:35.354 --> 27:37.756
You should hear T.J. laugh
when he plays with Tommy.

- Uh, where'd you want it, Vanilla?
- Where it is.

us 200 bucks to move it.

- Did he?
- Tommy, you should stay for dinner.

28:07.355 --> 28:12.458
Yes, you should. And we'll
help you move the couch later.

- Oh, no ... no trouble. No trouble.

jo Friday really likes Tommy.

Well, that's good. Verbal
compliments often serve as foreplay,

29:37.978 --> 29:40.413

of dopamine and oxytocin.

A member of Four Corners.

30:42.046 --> 30:44.114
She's was arrested six times
for assault and battery,

30:44.182 --> 30:46.851
- four times for drugs.
- Nice friend.

30:46.918 --> 30:49.920
She worked with Isabella in packing.
I'm getting Josie's phone records,

30:49.955 --> 30:52.590

to help her beat up Isabella.

30:52.624 --> 30:54.458
Okay.

30:54.526 --> 30:57.895
The substance that Frankie
noticed on Isabella's pant leg

30:57.929 --> 31:01.498
- Is red candle wax.
- She bought a candle at the Bodega.

31:02.067 --> 31:04.935
We need to come up with a
way to get rid of Strawberry.

31:11.076 --> 31:14.111
No thanks.
"Get rid of"?

of a mob boss's daughter.

Which I am. Think about it ...
everybody has a dark side.

31:20.919 --> 31:25.555
- We simply exploit Stuart's.
- Really? What's his "dark side"?

31:25.590 --> 31:28.125
Did he make copies of his
butt at the big box store?

31:28.159 --> 31:29.593
I don't think that's enough.

31:29.627 --> 31:30.728

31:30.762 --> 31:33.964
- No, I know he hasn't been arrested.
- Oh, did a background check.

You abused your authority.

<i>Why don't you keep your
voice down, all right?</i>

31:37.636 --> 31:41.105
Yes, I wanted to know if a grown
man that goes by "Strawberry"

31:41.139 --> 31:44.742
was ever arrested for child
abuse or urinating in public.

31:44.777 --> 31:49.081
The only dark thing I noticed about
him were his periorbital circles.

31:50.050 --> 31:53.719
Dark circles under his eyes.
Stuart has severe allergies.

Okay. Well, thank you.
That's very helpful, Maura.

gonna turn down a house

It's time-stamped right at her lunch.

And there's a response
from this "Tito" person.

32:26.086 --> 32:29.956
"Beat her down and ink her."
What does that mean?

32:29.990 --> 32:32.225
You can read latin but
you can't understand that?

32:34.227 --> 32:38.263

as the leader of Four Corners.

32:38.298 --> 32:41.566
- He's out on parole.
- So, Tito wanted Isabella.

32:41.601 --> 32:45.837
- And Josie made it her job to deliver.
- Sounds right.

32:45.872 --> 32:48.206
Josie texted her two friends
after she heard from Tito.

32:48.241 --> 32:53.845
"Ball up ink party 4 on Cortez."
Latin is simpler.

32:53.879 --> 32:57.115
No, they planned to ambush
Isabella on Cortez Street...

32:58.117 --> 33:02.786
...until she curled up into a "ball."
"4" means 4:00 ... right after work.

33:02.821 --> 33:04.755
Maybe Tito finished
her off in the church.

33:04.789 --> 33:09.025
Yeah, check and see if Tito's parole
requires electronic monitoring.

33:09.059 --> 33:10.826

<i>But he didn't leave his
house from Friday to Sunday.</i>

33:15.599 --> 33:17.800
So that means Tito's not our killer.

33:19.103 --> 33:21.204
Let's go see Josie.

Is it okay if I take Frankie?
He was really helpful.

33:24.942 --> 33:27.352
Yeah.
He could use the practice.

33:28.246 --> 33:31.248
Take a good look, Josie.

33:33.918 --> 33:37.888
- She thought you were her friend.
- She was dumb, then.

33:37.922 --> 33:40.823
Dumb to tell you she was pregnant.

33:40.858 --> 33:44.727
We didn't do that to her.
We inked her. That's all.

33:44.795 --> 33:48.064
You did a little more than that.
You broke both of her arms.

33:49.900 --> 33:51.634
Not on purpose.

33:51.735 --> 33:54.170
Tito told you to ink her. Why?
He want a relationship with her?

33:54.205 --> 33:58.375
"Relationship"? Nah.
He saw her, her wanted to bang her.

33:58.409 --> 34:02.747
- So he wasn't the father of her baby?
- No. That's why I had to tell Tito.

Yeah. I can't imagine
losing this little baby.

34:39.018 --> 34:41.686
That's the mother of the
girl we found in the church.

34:41.721 --> 34:43.521
Ms. Valdez?

34:44.857 --> 34:45.956
Good morning.

34:45.992 --> 34:51.342
Sergeant, I found something
in the back of my daughter's closet.

34:52.831 --> 34:55.033
Is that your baby?

34:55.067 --> 35:01.140
Oh, gosh, no.
It's ... it's my grandbaby.

35:02.174 --> 35:05.011
I'll never have a grandchild.

35:05.045 --> 35:08.681
Could I get you something?
A cup of coffee?

35:11.151 --> 35:13.486
No, no. Thank you.

35:13.521 --> 35:19.125
Um, Sergeant, please, look inside.
I don't know what it means.

35:21.896 --> 35:25.265
- Britmore college.
- Do you know who it belongs to?

35:25.333 --> 35:27.401
I might.

35:29.470 --> 35:33.073
The church gardener's kid,
Samuel Morales, goes to Britmore.

35:33.174 --> 35:34.408
Running him.

35:34.875 --> 35:36.910
<i>No arrest record.</i>

35:36.944 --> 35:38.778
I'll get his phone records
and his credit cards.

35:38.846 --> 35:42.015
I'll grab Jane. We'll bring him in.

35:42.050 --> 35:45.285
Jane: Samuel, we have
the records right here.

35:45.319 --> 35:48.455
You took the 6:00 P.M. train
from New Haven to Boston on Friday.

35:48.523 --> 35:51.158
You came to Boston
after Isabella called you

35:51.192 --> 35:52.926
on the prepaid phone you
bought for her, didn't you?

35:52.961 --> 35:55.462
Did Isabella join a gang? She
start seeing somebody else?

35:55.496 --> 35:58.065
- She make you jealous, Sam?
- Isabella wasn't in a gang.

35:58.099 --> 36:02.102
She should've gone to Britmore with me.

36:02.137 --> 36:05.840
[ sighs ] She was brilliant.

36:07.542 --> 36:11.845
They inked her because she didn't
want be part of Four Corners.

36:14.883 --> 36:18.319
- When did you see Isabella's tattoo?
- In the church.

36:18.354 --> 36:22.090
- I met her there.
- Why did you kill her, Samuel?

36:22.158 --> 36:24.626
My father told me that we
couldn't be seen together...

36:24.994 --> 36:28.030
...or the Four Corner gang-bangers
were gonna kill us both.

36:30.100 --> 36:34.438
I left her in that church.
Why did I do that?

36:34.472 --> 36:38.430
- You left her after you strangled her?
- He said he would take care of it.

36:41.079 --> 36:43.981
I want to talk to Father Crowley.

36:44.016 --> 36:47.418
Get out of here!
I want to talk to Father Crowley!

36:48.587 --> 36:50.488
Okay.

36:50.523 --> 36:52.390
[ elevator bell dings ]

36:52.424 --> 36:54.459
I think he might want to confess.

36:54.493 --> 36:58.997
Even if he does, it won't be
admissable because I can't testify.

36:59.098 --> 37:01.300
Understood, Father. But maybe he'll
talk to us once he talks to you.

37:01.334 --> 37:03.102
<i>Jane: He's in here.</i>

37:04.438 --> 37:06.105
Frost! Help us!
We've got to get him down!

37:06.140 --> 37:08.441
[ all shouting indistinctly ]

37:08.476 --> 37:11.178
Father, he's still alive!
Call an ambulance!

37:11.246 --> 37:13.948
<i>Hey! Someone!
Ambulance!</i>

37:13.982 --> 37:15.582
Watch his head, watch his head.

37:15.617 --> 37:17.851
<i>Come on, Samuel.</i>

37:17.919 --> 37:20.120
<i>Come on, buddy. 
Come on, buddy.</i>

37:22.112 --> 37:24.112
<i>Alright. Thanks.</i>

37:24.113 --> 37:26.081
He's in critical condition,
but he's alive.

37:26.115 --> 37:28.583
- What about brain damage?
- They don't think so,

37:28.618 --> 37:30.218
but there's a lot of
damage to his larynx.

37:30.253 --> 37:33.021
Damn.
As soon as he gets out of the hospital,

37:33.055 --> 37:34.622
he'll be going on trial
for killing his girlfriend.

37:37.159 --> 37:39.060
Why did Samuel say
his father wouldn't let

37:39.095 --> 37:41.095
him and Isabella be
seen with gang-bangers?

37:42.464 --> 37:44.466
Frost, can you look up Mateo Morales?

37:44.533 --> 37:48.069
Yeah. His Father seemed to
know the gang would kill her

37:48.137 --> 37:49.671
once a banger like Tito had claimed her.

37:49.705 --> 37:52.407
Yeah. "he said he'd take care of it."
What did that mean?

37:52.442 --> 37:58.012
Mateo Morales, Sam's father, was
once a Four Corners gang member.

38:10.493 --> 38:14.129
- Look at the rosary.
- Explains the ligature marks.

38:22.038 --> 38:27.542
St. Margaret of Cortona,
Patron Saint of single mothers.

38:29.078 --> 38:31.747
Isabella would have given up Samuel

38:31.815 --> 38:33.515
and taken care of their baby by herself

38:33.550 --> 38:35.417
if she thought that'd
give Samuel a better life.

38:35.485 --> 38:38.655
But you knew Samuel would never
give up Isabella, didn't you?

38:38.689 --> 38:42.325
You told your son you'd take care of it.
He thought you meant

38:42.360 --> 38:44.061
<i>that you'd help take care of
him and his pregnant girlfriend.</i>

38:44.095 --> 38:46.497
Instead, you wrapped that
rosary around Isabella's neck

38:46.531 --> 38:49.433
and strangled that
18-year-old girl.

38:49.468 --> 38:52.170
I bet we find Isabella's
DNA on that rosary.

38:52.204 --> 38:56.507
- [ voice breaking ] She belonged to them.
- She wasn't a gang member.

38:56.541 --> 38:59.110
She was once they made her one.

39:00.090 --> 39:04.617
<i>I had no choice. 
She was their property.</i>

39:04.651 --> 39:08.320
They would've killed my
son for trying to take her.

39:10.390 --> 39:13.359
You're under arrest for the
murder of Isabella Valdez.

39:24.739 --> 39:27.440
<i>It's really nice of you to babysit.</i>

39:27.475 --> 39:29.276
Come here, baby. Come here!

39:29.310 --> 39:31.178
Yeah. I didn't know how I
was going to get lyds here

39:31.246 --> 39:32.746
to my big box going-away party.
[ laughs ]

39:32.814 --> 39:35.682
Copy department knows how to
throw a party, that's for sure.

39:35.717 --> 39:39.854
- T.J.! What's up, buddy?
- Oh. Oh, no. I...

39:39.888 --> 39:44.491
I-I-I can't be near animals.

39:44.526 --> 39:48.729
<i>- [ sneezes ] Oh, oh.
- Maura: Here you go, take that.</i>

39:48.797 --> 39:53.567
- I got to go. I got to go.
- Wait. Y-you're allergic to dogs?

39:53.601 --> 39:54.701
[ sneezes ]

39:54.736 --> 39:55.736
[ grunts ]

39:55.770 --> 40:00.207
- All dogs? [ sneezes ]
- Take a shower.

40:00.241 --> 40:03.243
And call me ... oh. 
Oh. Oh.

40:03.278 --> 40:04.344
<i>Stuart.</i>

40:09.351 --> 40:11.285
Take a shower?

40:12.254 --> 40:16.490
Uh, well, you know,
we can still babysit.

40:16.558 --> 40:22.163
Yeah, um, if you want to go
somewhere, you know, or do something.

40:22.230 --> 40:24.165
Take advantage of the free babysitting.

40:27.569 --> 40:30.838
Well, I can't go to
the big box party, so...

40:32.840 --> 40:34.541
We could go for a walk?

40:39.413 --> 40:42.882
Yeah, sure.
I'd like that.

40:50.490 --> 40:52.191
- Have fun.
- Bye.

40:52.225 --> 40:54.160
<i>Who's that? Who's that?</i>

40:57.764 --> 41:00.600
Yeah!
High five, baby.

41:00.634 --> 41:04.303
<i>You don't want to go with
that weirdo Strawberry. No.</i>

41:04.338 --> 41:05.638
[ smooches ]

41:05.739 --> 41:09.208
<i>What do we do if Lydia
chooses Strawberry over pets?</i>

41:09.242 --> 41:11.276
[ high-pitched voice ] Then
auntie Jane goes rogue again.

41:11.310 --> 41:13.845
We need to discuss
your lawless behavior.

41:14.480 --> 41:17.714
Not in front of the nephew, Maura.

41:16.749 --> 41:21.185
<i>- Me. Me.
- Can I hold you?</i>

41:22.265 --> 41:24.186
<i><font color="cyan"> End </font></i>
