[doorknob clicks]

01:40.600 --> 01:41.518
Hello.

01:42.519 --> 01:44.270
I'm sorry, I'm not in the mood.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.106
To say "hello"?

01:46.189 --> 01:47.941
I know your "hello's," honey,

01:48.024 --> 01:50.276
and that one was pouring me
a glass of wine.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.780
Well, it's been a few days and I guess
I've just gotten used to the frequency,

01:53.863 --> 01:56.825
intensity and sheer insanity
of your undead libido.

01:56.908 --> 01:58.701
It hasn't been that crazy.

01:58.785 --> 02:01.830
Sweetheart, we had sex in the bathroom
at Target 'cause their logo turned you on.

02:01.913 --> 02:04.666
It's obviously designed
to look like a clitoris.

02:04.749 --> 02:07.961
[sighs] I'm just feeling
a little low energy.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.588
Maybe I need to eat people
with more iron in their diet.

02:11.464 --> 02:15.009
It's okay. We don't have to break
a baby changing table every day.

02:15.093 --> 02:17.679
How about I give you a foot massage?
No strings attached.

02:18.847 --> 02:19.931
Uh...

02:21.141 --> 02:23.726
-I have to bake brownies.
-Now? It's 1:00 a.m.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.646
We have to check in on Lisa tomorrow
so people don't get suspicious.

02:26.729 --> 02:29.315
And nothing says
"We didn't kill your husband"

02:29.399 --> 02:31.359
like a fresh plate of brownies.

02:34.237 --> 02:36.239
-[door opens]
-Can I at least lick the spoon?

02:38.616 --> 02:40.118
Give me something.

02:40.201 --> 02:43.204
[instrumental theme music playing]

02:47.292 --> 02:48.960
So Dan is still officially
considered missing,

02:49.043 --> 02:52.088
but I may have to face the fact
that he's never coming back.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.300
-That's terrible.
-We are so sorry.

02:55.383 --> 02:57.302
-Can I have a brownie?
-[Lisa] Of course.

02:57.385 --> 02:59.429
Makes it a little easier
knowing Dan was a crooked cop

02:59.512 --> 03:01.514
with a hundred grand stashed away
while I'm running around

03:01.598 --> 03:03.474
with a $40 Michael Kors knock-off.

03:03.558 --> 03:06.936
-Fuck you, that's a fake?
-That's why I can't wear it in the rain.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.648
-Sounds like everyone's moving on nicely.
-Kebab time.

03:12.317 --> 03:16.946
-Oh, hello. I didn't know we had visitors.
-Oh, it's you.

03:17.614 --> 03:19.324
Here. How wonderful.

03:19.407 --> 03:21.951
Joel, Sheila, you remember Anne,
Dan's partner?

03:22.035 --> 03:26.122
She has been so helpful to me
and Eric these past couple days.

03:26.205 --> 03:29.626
-I think it's what Dan would want.
-Such a rock.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.961
-Wow.
-Uh-huh.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.047
You guys want some shish kebabs?

03:34.130 --> 03:36.633
No, thank you, we're not kebab people.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.509
And we just came by to check on Lisa.

03:38.593 --> 03:42.513
And now having done that, we will return
to our home to watch television.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.182
Did you tell them about that guy Loki?

03:48.102 --> 03:49.103
That guy Loki?

03:49.187 --> 03:51.272
We thought Dan had killed
this drug dealer, Loki.

03:51.356 --> 03:53.983
We found his apartment trashed,
blood everywhere.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.777
But it turns out, the guy's not dead.

03:57.987 --> 03:58.821
Mmm.

04:01.157 --> 04:01.991
Mmm!

04:03.076 --> 04:04.160
Mmm!

04:04.786 --> 04:08.706
-Nothing beats a juicy, fresh tomato.
-Anne grows tomatoes in her garden.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.209
I thought they would be too dry this year.

04:11.834 --> 04:13.836
Tomatoes. What can't they do?

04:13.920 --> 04:16.422
Vote? Drive? I don't know. But, Loki?

04:16.506 --> 04:18.549
Oh, yeah, he was holed up
at the Starlight Motel.

04:18.633 --> 04:20.260
Said this couple was trying to bite him.

04:20.343 --> 04:24.347
He must have gotten into some bad drugs
because he also vomited everywhere.

04:25.473 --> 04:26.975
[Lisa] So Dan's not a double murderer.

04:27.058 --> 04:29.102
Just a single murderer,
who had $100,000

04:29.185 --> 04:31.354
and told me we couldn't afford
a housekeeper once a month.

04:33.022 --> 04:36.192
Exactly how much vomit
are we talking about here, Anne?

04:36.276 --> 04:38.278
So much vomit.

04:39.195 --> 04:42.740
We all thought he died.
But next day, he was gone.

04:42.824 --> 04:45.034
This is a weird question,
but did you happen to find

04:45.118 --> 04:47.036
something that looked like
a small red ball?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.037
No.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.331
[both sighing]

04:50.415 --> 04:52.542
Just this medium red ball.

04:53.710 --> 04:54.794
Oh, my God.

04:56.212 --> 04:59.757
-I'd call that small, Esther.
-Maybe. I have little hands.

04:59.841 --> 05:02.468
-Still.
-Did he leave anything else?

05:02.969 --> 05:06.180

05:09.767 --> 05:11.144
That's medium.

-Look.

05:15.231 --> 05:18.026
Oh, God. We're nice
and we've already killed three people.

05:18.109 --> 05:19.777
Can you imagine what an undead person

05:19.861 --> 05:21.821
who started out as a murderer
is going to do?

05:21.904 --> 05:25.158
-And it's all our fault.
-We are such assholes.

05:27.285 --> 05:28.953
We have to stop him.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.710
I think we bought too much stuff.

05:35.793 --> 05:38.796
We've never killed a dead person before.
I don't know how to shop for that.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.382
You could start
by staying out of the cosmetics aisle.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.759
I needed a brush.

05:42.842 --> 05:46.304
Just once I'd like to come home from
a store with only the stuff on our list.

05:46.971 --> 05:50.808
Oh, I don't remember a men's
manicure kit being on our list.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.351
Now I don't have to borrow yours.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.772
Look, the whole system broke down
after you bought the brush.

05:55.855 --> 05:57.774
I just embraced the chaos.

["Breakin' Outta Hell"

Does this hat
make me look like The Edge?

06:23.299 --> 06:26.552
No. Wait, yes.
What do you want to hear?

06:26.636 --> 06:29.305
-Well, I'm wearing it.
-You look awesome.

06:31.682 --> 06:33.643
Do you think we should get a gun?

06:33.726 --> 06:35.603
Statistically, if we have a gun,

06:35.686 --> 06:38.523
we're 2.7 times more likely
to hurt ourselves than Loki.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.690
As is our right.

06:40.191 --> 06:41.943

we're gonna get the job done.

06:44.904 --> 06:45.780
Get what job done?

06:47.949 --> 06:50.868
The same job we do every day:
selling a house.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.412
It's in a bad neighborhood.

06:53.246 --> 06:55.748
The bigger question is,
why aren't you in school?

06:55.832 --> 06:57.667
'Cause I'm selling a house
in a bad neighborhood.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.168
See how lame that excuse sounds?

07:00.086 --> 07:02.296
We said we'd be honest
with each other, okay?

Sweetie, we are not going to lie
to you anymore.

07:08.386 --> 07:11.180
But being honest does not mean
that we are going to involve you

07:11.264 --> 07:13.474
in something where I may
or may not look like The Edge.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.351
Do you have any thoughts on this?

07:15.435 --> 07:17.895
Yeah. Take it off.

together and that was pretty cool.

and I only got to go once,

This sucks. And that jet pack thing
was not your idea.

In your notebook it says
you "must kill" tonight at 8:00?

Who are you planning on killing, Loki?

-Everyone.
-Jesus.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.793
I was actualizing what I wanted to happen
in my performance.

11:09.418 --> 11:12.546

is for such a specific audience.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.488
Yes! Music was always my passion.

11:37.571 --> 11:41.242
But I had no self-esteem,
so instead I embraced violence,

embraces a blade of grass.

Really? You like that? I think
the imagery feels a little familiar.

that makes it so profound.

12:32.960 --> 12:35.921
You think? 'Cause it feels
like you're being judgmental.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.633
Honey, do you think you could
pay our tab so we could leave?

12:39.717 --> 12:42.678
Also, uh, put something
in Loki's tip jar for the CD.

12:42.762 --> 12:45.598
-Please, that would be an insult.
-Done.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.267
Thank you, honey, so much.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.604
[gasps] My fucking toe fell off.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.272
-What?
-The little one, it just dropped off.

12:53.355 --> 12:55.733
Has anything like that happened to you?

12:55.816 --> 12:58.569
-No. That must be awful.
-I haven't told Joel yet.

12:58.652 --> 13:00.863
He's not gonna be able
to handle me deteriorating.

13:00.946 --> 13:02.907
-Maybe I can help you.
-Really?

13:02.990 --> 13:06.786
We're the only two like us.
We have to look out for each other.

13:07.077 --> 13:08.579
And learn from each other.

13:09.079 --> 13:12.249
Thank you.
And may I share something with you?

13:12.333 --> 13:17.171
If you miss eating pizza,
eat a man who just ate pizza.

13:18.714 --> 13:20.090
Smart.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.182
[rattling]

13:28.265 --> 13:30.476
Mr. Magnet! Open up. It's Abby.

13:30.559 --> 13:33.479
Uh, the underage redhead
you wanted to bone.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.397
He might not remember your name.

13:37.066 --> 13:38.526
The padlock's off the door.

13:46.116 --> 13:47.409
[Eric] Oh, my God.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.161
Whoa.

13:59.922 --> 14:00.923
Damn.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.218
Is that heroin?

14:04.718 --> 14:07.555
Judging by the smile on his face,
I'm guessing it's not insulin.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.431
-Check his pulse.
-You check his pulse.

14:09.515 --> 14:11.767
-He liked you better.
-[tersely] Yes, he did!

14:16.230 --> 14:17.481
He's cold.

14:18.440 --> 14:20.609
-[sighs]
-Should we call the police?

14:20.693 --> 14:22.236
Here's my perspective on that.

14:22.319 --> 14:24.530
We hired a guy who does illegal stuff
to fix a bike

14:24.613 --> 14:27.283
we're not legally allowed to ride
with money I stole from a corrupt cop

14:27.366 --> 14:29.326
whose body is in your parents' freezer.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.036
So, no.

14:32.538 --> 14:33.747
I get that.

14:34.707 --> 14:37.418
Okay. Let's grab my dad's bike
and get out of here.

14:41.505 --> 14:42.423
Where is it?

14:44.383 --> 14:45.634
I think it's everywhere.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.678
He took our money
and chopped it up for parts?

14:47.761 --> 14:50.389
Wow. What a valuable learning experience.
Shall we go?

14:50.472 --> 14:53.684
When my parents see my dad's bike
is missing they're gonna freak out.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.188
-Huh.
-What?

14:58.272 --> 15:01.108
I'm just thinking, my mom eats people,
and this is a person.

15:01.191 --> 15:02.443
Those are both true statements,

15:02.526 --> 15:04.403
but I don't like the way
you're connecting them.

15:04.486 --> 15:06.196
They're gonna be mad
about the bike, anyway.

15:06.780 --> 15:10.534
If we keep him, my mom gets
a few meals out of it

15:10.618 --> 15:13.162
and I get to show them
I can handle their world.

15:14.413 --> 15:17.583
Plus, something tells me
Travis would enjoy a woman eating him.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.385
[cell phone vibrating]

15:36.644 --> 15:38.103
Oh, hi. How are you?

15:39.647 --> 15:42.691
-I'm fine. What's that?
-Just a text.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.778
-Is it Loki?
-I can't tell you that.

15:45.861 --> 15:49.239
That would be a violation
of my Fourth Amendment right to privacy.

15:49.323 --> 15:51.909
That's interesting.
You haven't cited that amendment before.

15:51.992 --> 15:56.080
Well, I'm citing it now
because, well, I take the Fifth on that.

15:56.163 --> 15:58.165
It's just hard to see you
connecting with someone

15:58.248 --> 16:00.584
when you and I haven't exactly been
burning up the bed sheets,

16:00.668 --> 16:03.128
we literally did last week
when our candle play got out of hand.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.881
So can I please see the text
to put my mind at ease?

16:05.965 --> 16:09.176
-Are you saying you don't trust me?
-Of course I trust you.

16:09.259 --> 16:12.513
You know what, I'mma go downstairs,
make a sandwich, and...

16:20.479 --> 16:21.814
watch the game.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.193
[grunting]

16:30.823 --> 16:33.993
[grunts] He's too big. Plus,
he won't bend, he's got rigor mortis.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.829
Damn it. You try to do something nice
for your family.

16:36.912 --> 16:40.165
Okay. Weird idea?
If we break his elbows and kneecaps,

16:40.249 --> 16:43.002
we can bend his limbs the wrong way
and maybe Tetris the whole thing in.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.920
Wow. Okay.

16:46.296 --> 16:49.258
Sure, I took karate as a kid.
Yeah, grab his leg.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.300
Okay.

16:55.222 --> 16:57.349
Okay. Here we go.

16:57.433 --> 17:01.270
Ready? I'm gonna--
I'm gonna snap this dead guy's leg.

17:01.937 --> 17:03.147
You don't have to do this, Abby.

17:03.230 --> 17:05.024
If he's still in one piece,
we can put him back.

17:05.107 --> 17:08.277
-But once we break him, we own him.
-My parents kill people.

17:08.360 --> 17:11.363
My mom puts them in blenders
and eats them. I can do this.

17:12.197 --> 17:14.533
-On three. Ready?
-[strained grunt]

17:14.616 --> 17:17.327
One... two...

17:24.376 --> 17:26.378
-Can I look?
-Not yet.

17:27.337 --> 17:29.465
-No peeking.
-Okay.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.051
Now.

17:34.470 --> 17:36.805
Wow. A box full of feet.

17:37.514 --> 17:41.060
I only needed the one toe
but you got me a literal foot locker.

17:41.143 --> 17:42.895
We can match the perfect color and size,

17:42.978 --> 17:46.190
and I know a doctor who can clip off
the toe and sew it on you.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.734
All he'll want is some cocaine
and a handwritten thank you note.

17:48.817 --> 17:52.196
Well, that's great,
but where did you get all these?

17:52.279 --> 17:54.615
From small, bad men
who were no longer using them.

17:55.783 --> 17:58.285
Well, if they were just going to waste...

18:03.999 --> 18:06.794
Mmm... Sheila.

18:07.377 --> 18:11.215
Your skin is so soft and cold.

18:11.882 --> 18:13.008
What are you doing?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.969
Sheila, as far as we know, we're
the only people like us in the world.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.931
-We should be together.
-What? I'm married.

18:19.014 --> 18:22.226
I've only met you twice
and both times I was trying to kill you.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.561
So our relationship starts
from a place of passion.

18:24.645 --> 18:28.732
No, this is crazy. I love my husband.

18:28.816 --> 18:29.900
[scoffs]

18:29.983 --> 18:32.569
It's just... really disappointing.

18:32.653 --> 18:35.072
Even dead men and women
can't be friends.

18:36.740 --> 18:37.783
Fuck.

18:40.202 --> 18:43.205
-I will never give up, my evening rose.
-[van door shuts]

18:44.289 --> 18:48.168
-[phone recorder beeps]
-"I will never give up, my evening rose."

18:49.628 --> 18:50.629
Also...

18:51.296 --> 18:52.840
murder Joel.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.803
[both panting]

18:58.470 --> 19:00.264
I'll wipe off my fingerprints.

19:01.932 --> 19:02.975
[Abby] I'm such an idiot.

19:03.642 --> 19:04.601
I lost your money,

19:04.685 --> 19:08.063
I let some creep chop my dad's bike up
into a million pieces.

19:08.147 --> 19:10.357
My parents are right.
I'm not ready for anything.

19:11.441 --> 19:12.526
Seriously?

19:13.485 --> 19:17.030
Abby, you are the most awesome,
capable person I've ever met.

19:17.739 --> 19:19.199
You tear-gassed a drug dealer.

19:19.783 --> 19:22.411
You gave me the confidence
to stand up to my stepdad.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.121
You saved your parents
from a murder charge

19:24.204 --> 19:26.540
with just a flashlight
like you're freakin' MacGyver.

19:28.750 --> 19:32.421
Was that too honest? Was it just weird?
Do you know who MacGyver is?

19:32.504 --> 19:33.755
Yes.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.383
And you're always weird.

19:36.466 --> 19:37.593
[nervous chuckle]

19:39.052 --> 19:42.055
All right, so was the needle
in his right arm, or his left?

19:42.681 --> 19:45.392
I don't remember, uh,
but I think it was in his left.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.394
-[softly] Okay.
-Careful.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.940
All right, here we go. You ready?

19:54.443 --> 19:56.653
One, two...

19:56.737 --> 19:59.573
and I'll just put it right here,
that's good.

20:06.121 --> 20:07.372
What's that?

20:10.125 --> 20:11.627
[alarm chirps]

20:14.338 --> 20:16.673
["Breakin' Outta Hell"
by Airbourne playing]

20:21.678 --> 20:23.680
When'd you learn
how to drive a motorcycle?

20:23.764 --> 20:24.723
Now.

20:25.474 --> 20:26.391
Oh.

20:28.685 --> 20:30.479
[engine revving]

20:30.562 --> 20:33.357
-[Abby] Whoo-hoo!
-[Eric] Motherfuckers!

20:37.903 --> 20:40.906
[soft, romantic music playing]

20:46.787 --> 20:47.788
Joel?

20:51.416 --> 20:52.417
Joel?

20:56.046 --> 20:57.839
Whassup, Santa Clarita?

20:59.341 --> 21:03.637
March 27, 2000: that sign
stood in front of our first listing.

21:03.720 --> 21:07.474
-Everyone said we'd never sell it.
-The two-bedroom colonial.

21:07.557 --> 21:11.353
-With the unpermitted garage.
-We closed at asking.

21:11.436 --> 21:12.813
-[clinking]
-[chuckles]

21:14.147 --> 21:16.525
Afterward, to mark the occasion,

21:16.608 --> 21:19.069
I made you the only meal
I knew how to cook.

21:20.612 --> 21:23.824
Spaghetti and meatballs. Ohh.

21:25.492 --> 21:28.787
-This is so sweet. I wish I could eat it.
-You can.

21:28.870 --> 21:31.873
It's made from 100 percent free-range Dan.

21:32.457 --> 21:35.794
-Really?
-The noodles are striated biceps.

21:35.877 --> 21:38.922
The meatballs are from...
Honestly, I don't know where they're from.

21:39.006 --> 21:41.341
It was a horrible mess.
Somewhere in the chest cavity.

21:41.425 --> 21:44.636
-I can't believe you did all this.
-It wasn't easy. I puked twice.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.014
Also, I think we're gonna have
to throw out the pasta maker.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.890
I left it to soak,
but it's not looking good.

21:48.974 --> 21:52.352
Did you try vinegar and baking soda?
That's how I got Gary out of my shoes.

21:53.061 --> 21:54.021
[softly] Oh.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.773
I shouldn't have made
such a big deal about Loki.

21:57.399 --> 21:59.568
It just freaked me out
you two having so much in common.

21:59.651 --> 22:02.738
But then I realized we've spent
half our lives together.

22:02.821 --> 22:05.574
No one will ever have more in common
with you than I do.

22:06.616 --> 22:10.787
That's wonderful. And you're right,
Loki is no threat to you.

22:12.205 --> 22:13.332
Sheila!

22:16.835 --> 22:20.630
What are you doing?
I told you I'm not interested.

22:20.714 --> 22:22.632
And what's with the door, man?

22:22.716 --> 22:26.136
-You totally fucked up our door.
-I have the answer to your toe problem.

22:26.219 --> 22:29.056
-You have a toe problem?
-I was going to tell you--

22:29.139 --> 22:31.266
Her toe fell off. She knew
you wouldn't be able to handle it.

22:31.349 --> 22:33.810
-Your toe fell off? Oh, my God!
-See?

22:33.894 --> 22:34.936
-Shut up.
-You shut up.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.730
No, you, and I'm really pissed
about the door.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.940
-Guys!
-Sheila, come away with me,

22:39.024 --> 22:40.567
and your toe problem won't be a problem,

22:40.650 --> 22:43.320
because I will accept you
no matter how much you deteriorate.

22:43.403 --> 22:45.739
You and I are the same.
We should be together.

22:45.822 --> 22:50.452
Okay, look, clearly neither one of us
wants to fight. And I don't blame us.

22:50.535 --> 22:51.828
I mean, look how big we are--

22:52.662 --> 22:53.872
[yelps] and how strong.

22:56.416 --> 22:58.418
Sorry, Joel, you seem like a nice man,

22:58.502 --> 23:00.504
but for Sheila to be free...

23:00.587 --> 23:02.714
she has to stop clinging to her past.

23:02.798 --> 23:04.174
-[straining]
-[Sheila grunts]

23:07.803 --> 23:10.430
-Whassup!
-[gasps] Come on!

23:11.098 --> 23:12.307
Let's go, go.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.604
We have to kill him.
It's our only way out.

23:17.687 --> 23:20.524
-I know. So why did we come upstairs?
-To get our weapons.

23:20.607 --> 23:22.317
You mean the ones
we weren't going to use

23:22.400 --> 23:24.611
so I put them back in the kitchen
and the garage?

23:24.694 --> 23:26.905
-Yes, those!
-Don't you get upset with me.

23:26.988 --> 23:29.616
You're the one who bought me
that Japanese tidying-up book.

23:29.699 --> 23:31.159
I just wanted your shoes
out of the hallway.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.702
[Loki] Sheila!

23:32.786 --> 23:34.329
-Quick, barricade the door.
-Okay.

23:35.914 --> 23:39.167
Why didn't you want me to know about
your toe? That why we weren't having sex?

23:39.251 --> 23:41.044
-You didn't want me to see it?
-Yes.

23:41.837 --> 23:45.590
-Honey, I can handle it.
-I don't know if I can handle it.

23:47.259 --> 23:50.804
Okay? What if this keeps happening to me?
What if I'm breaking apart?

23:50.887 --> 23:54.516
What if I lose control
and you have to kill me?

23:54.599 --> 23:57.978
What if we're too young to get married?
What if we can't sell a house?

23:58.061 --> 24:00.397
What if this baby changing table
can't support our weight?

24:00.480 --> 24:03.358
We'll figure it out, honey.
We always have.

24:03.441 --> 24:04.901
-[thump]
-[gasps]

24:04.985 --> 24:07.863
-Or we'll just die right here.
-At least we'll die together.

24:07.946 --> 24:10.949
-Huh.
-Sheila! This is the right thing.

24:11.032 --> 24:12.659
In time you'll see it.

24:53.158 --> 24:54.242
[exhales]

24:57.787 --> 24:59.915
I take back everything I said
about that brush.

25:08.798 --> 25:11.384
I got the body in the car.
Are you sure you can't eat him?

25:11.468 --> 25:14.804
-It seems like such a waste.
-The undead can't eat the undead.

25:14.888 --> 25:17.098
They're too... dead.

25:18.350 --> 25:20.018
Come here. I want to see your toe.

25:20.101 --> 25:23.230
I don't think so.
Maybe you never have to see it.

25:24.564 --> 25:28.443
Maybe I just can have sex
with my socks on.

25:28.526 --> 25:31.738
Or... heels. Bet you'd like that,
wouldn't you?

25:31.821 --> 25:34.157
I would. But eventually
I'd want to take them off of you.
