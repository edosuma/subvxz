00:00.944 --> 00:02.811
[pop music plays]

00:04.278 --> 00:05.480
Maggie: You know what I don't get?

00:05.515 --> 00:08.850
We eat the same thing, work in
the same germ-infested hospital.

00:08.884 --> 00:10.419
Here I am, totally fine,

00:10.486 --> 00:12.987
and you've been vomiting since this morning.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.656
Well, we don't do everything together.

00:14.723 --> 00:16.358
Bet Joel gave it to you.

00:16.426 --> 00:18.860
Have you seen him since he was...

00:18.928 --> 00:21.128
Arrested? No.

00:21.196 --> 00:23.531
But, uh, Zach said he was fine
when he bailed him out.

00:23.599 --> 00:24.699
Good.

00:24.733 --> 00:25.900
You know what you need?

00:25.935 --> 00:27.869
Something to settle your stomach.

00:27.937 --> 00:29.571
Mmm.

00:29.638 --> 00:30.939
Mm. That isn't it.

00:30.973 --> 00:32.640
[singsong voice] Mm, it's good...

00:32.708 --> 00:35.176
[normal voice] Um, once you
get past the smell and the...

00:35.243 --> 00:36.410
thickness.

00:36.445 --> 00:37.578
[chuckles]

00:40.215 --> 00:42.216
[glasses clink] Mmm.

00:42.284 --> 00:43.850
[gulps]

00:43.885 --> 00:45.486
- [gags]
- Wow.

00:45.554 --> 00:48.355
- Well, it's a good thing you're a doctor.
- And why is that?

00:48.423 --> 00:50.324
- Because you suck as a nurse.
- [chuckles]

00:50.358 --> 00:52.326
[cellphone vibrating]
Have fun on the night shift.

00:52.394 --> 00:54.194
Is that Joel?

00:56.764 --> 00:58.298
Hello?

00:58.365 --> 00:59.900
[siren wails]

00:59.934 --> 01:02.202
[police radio chatter]

01:02.269 --> 01:03.870
[sighs]

01:03.938 --> 01:05.072
Molly?

01:05.105 --> 01:06.873
Veloso: Dr. Kinney. Is this your daughter?

01:06.908 --> 01:08.374
My what? I'm sorry... Dr. Who?

01:08.442 --> 01:10.443
Mommy. I am so sorry.

01:11.812 --> 01:13.146
What's going on here?

01:13.180 --> 01:15.448
Well, to start, she's got no I.D.

01:15.483 --> 01:16.749
She's underage, and she's...

01:16.783 --> 01:18.218
She's drunk.

01:18.285 --> 01:20.386
Because I am not used to drinking.

01:20.454 --> 01:21.854
Look, she seems like a good kid.

01:21.922 --> 01:24.324
- She is.
- So I'm inclined to cut her some slack,

01:24.358 --> 01:26.125
but her name's on file now.

01:26.192 --> 01:28.694
There'll be no second chances.

01:28.729 --> 01:29.695
Good night, ma'am.

01:29.730 --> 01:31.263
Good night, officer.

01:34.267 --> 01:36.468
Let's go.

01:38.304 --> 01:39.371
Hurry up.

01:39.439 --> 01:41.473
[siren chirps]

01:43.176 --> 01:44.409
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:44.477 --> 01:46.145
Is that from the doctors' lounge?

01:46.179 --> 01:48.680
You know, Larouche makes
hot dogs in that coffee pot.

01:48.714 --> 01:50.382
Ugh, I thought that tasted funny.

01:50.450 --> 01:51.517
Yeah.

01:51.551 --> 01:52.784
How'd it go with Joel?

01:52.852 --> 01:55.287
Oh, he's, uh, gone completely AWOL.

01:55.321 --> 01:56.688
- You said he was fine.
- I lied.

01:56.722 --> 01:58.089
He looked like hell when I posted bail.

01:58.124 --> 01:59.691
Now all my calls are going
through to his voicemail.

01:59.725 --> 02:00.892
Same. I tried twice today.

02:00.926 --> 02:02.093
Manslaughter.

02:02.128 --> 02:04.029
I just can't picture Joel in jail. I can't.

02:04.063 --> 02:05.730
Well, let's not think that right now.

02:05.765 --> 02:07.398
There must be something
we can do for him, though.

02:07.432 --> 02:09.366
He said he wants to deal with it on his own.

02:09.401 --> 02:10.234
So we keep calling him.

02:10.269 --> 02:13.805
Yeah. [chuckles]

02:13.839 --> 02:16.774
So, are you and your fiancÃ©,
Herschel, planning a honeymoon?

02:16.808 --> 02:19.410
Mm, a honeymoon isn't really
jewish tradition.

02:19.444 --> 02:21.546
We have Sheva Brachot instead.

02:21.580 --> 02:23.781
What it lacks in scattered rose petals,

02:23.815 --> 02:26.984
it makes up for in dinners
with people you don't know.

02:27.018 --> 02:28.452
That sounds absolutely...

02:28.487 --> 02:30.921
What are the chances Dr. Bell
will let me take the week off?

02:30.989 --> 02:34.457
Uh, that's the thing. See,
um, Dawn never took time
off for her own honeymoon.

02:34.492 --> 02:35.525
You mean <i>your</i> honeymoon.

02:37.461 --> 02:39.930
I hear the coffee kiosk is nice
this time of year.

02:39.964 --> 02:42.800
Maggie: Up, up, up. Yeah.

02:42.834 --> 02:43.901
Is that your stock portfolio?

02:43.935 --> 02:46.003
Ugh, I wish. You need money for that.

02:46.071 --> 02:47.771
This is, uh, grade your M.D.

02:47.806 --> 02:49.739
Ugh, I hate the internet.

02:49.773 --> 02:51.675
What is grade your M.D.?

02:51.709 --> 02:54.611
It's a website where patients
can grade their doctors.

02:54.645 --> 02:56.079
You want me to find yours?

02:56.113 --> 02:57.514
Um, I don't think I have one.

02:57.582 --> 02:59.082
I didn't sign up for anything like that.

02:59.116 --> 03:00.350
No, it doesn't work that way.

03:00.384 --> 03:02.852
Like, here, I'm gonna find you.

03:02.920 --> 03:04.454
[clears throat]

03:06.023 --> 03:07.023
Huh.

03:07.057 --> 03:08.758
"Huh"?

03:09.960 --> 03:10.927
What?

03:10.961 --> 03:11.894
Nothing.

03:11.962 --> 03:13.162
Gimme.

03:15.065 --> 03:16.132
Oh.

03:16.166 --> 03:18.101
3 1/2 out of 5 isn't bad.

03:18.135 --> 03:19.535
Actually, it's out of 20.

03:20.838 --> 03:21.770
What?

03:21.838 --> 03:23.038
Mm-hmm.

03:23.106 --> 03:24.640
"Walked out in the middle of a consult."

03:24.708 --> 03:27.042
"Attention was divided."

03:27.110 --> 03:28.444
"Talks to himself."

03:28.511 --> 03:30.212
Yeah, I-I do do that.

03:30.280 --> 03:32.047
The internet is full of trolls
who love to complain.

03:32.115 --> 03:34.182
Well, fortunately, the only
opinions I give a crap about

03:34.251 --> 03:36.084
are those of a few of my peers.

03:36.119 --> 03:37.286
Hmm.

03:39.055 --> 03:41.522
Zach: Meet Tammy "Armageddon" Jenkins...

03:41.590 --> 03:43.524
fighter with a busted wing.

03:43.559 --> 03:44.893
I thought wrestling was scripted.

03:44.961 --> 03:46.728
It's not wrestling. It's MMA.

03:47.696 --> 03:49.798
If you'd ever seen me fight,
you'd know it's all real.

03:49.866 --> 03:50.999
[lips squeak]

03:52.568 --> 03:53.501
Okay.

03:53.569 --> 03:55.536
Um...

03:55.604 --> 03:58.640
Whoa. You seem to have
a, um, dislocated elbow.

03:58.707 --> 04:01.509
Can you move your fingers?

04:01.577 --> 04:02.744
Give me a thumbs up.

04:04.446 --> 04:05.846
And an "okay" sign.

04:05.914 --> 04:08.048
I'd prefer a K.O.

04:08.116 --> 04:10.050
So you had a fight tonight?

04:10.118 --> 04:11.952
And I would have won,

04:12.020 --> 04:14.972
but my opponent lied,
told the ref I tapped out.

04:15.022 --> 04:15.767
But you didn't?

04:15.817 --> 04:17.825
I bumped her leg, and she said
I gave the sign to quit.

04:17.892 --> 04:20.661
Okay, we're gonna give you
10 milligrams of ketamine,

04:20.695 --> 04:24.932
and, uh, this should give you
a slight out-of-body feeling.

04:24.966 --> 04:27.001
Oh, I have to pee clean for my next fight.

04:27.068 --> 04:28.602
You'll be fine.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.069
Okay.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.406
I am going to
pop your elbow back in.
[sighs]

04:32.440 --> 04:34.374
Just relax. Try not to fight me.

04:34.409 --> 04:37.277
Trust me, if I was fighting you,
you'd know it.

04:37.345 --> 04:38.512
[groans]

04:39.180 --> 04:40.714
- [elbow pops]
- Aah!

04:40.748 --> 04:41.881
Okay.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.717
[sighs]

04:44.785 --> 04:46.085
And that's in.

04:46.120 --> 04:47.086
Kara: Call me Kara.

04:47.121 --> 04:48.188
- Ouch.
- Shh!

04:48.222 --> 04:49.755
What?

04:49.790 --> 04:51.390
Maggie: - That's a nasty cut.
- I think that's Kara.

04:51.425 --> 04:53.559
Will I need a plastic surgeon?

04:53.593 --> 04:56.095
No, but you may need an eyebrow pencil.

04:56.130 --> 04:57.330
[chuckles]

04:57.364 --> 04:58.698
I'm trying to break into the movies.

04:58.732 --> 05:01.233
That's Kara. That's her.

05:01.267 --> 05:02.468
What are you doing? Hey.

05:02.502 --> 05:03.636
Where are you going?

05:03.670 --> 05:05.270
I did not tap out!

05:05.305 --> 05:07.573
Seriously? You want a rematch?

05:07.607 --> 05:09.041
Let's go.

05:09.075 --> 05:10.108
[scoffs]

05:10.143 --> 05:11.777
What about your arm, Armageddon?

05:11.812 --> 05:12.978
Charlie: Hey!

05:13.413 --> 05:15.948
- Call security!
Tammy: - I only need one.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.583
Woman over P.A.: - <i>Code white,
emergency department.</i>
- Whoa! whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:18.617 --> 05:19.985
<i>Code white, emergency department.</i>

05:20.019 --> 05:20.886
- Okay, okay!
- <i>Code white.</i>

05:20.920 --> 05:21.887
- I tap!
Charlie: - Stop!

05:21.921 --> 05:22.888
I'm tapping out!

05:22.922 --> 05:25.423
Hey! Hey! All right!

05:26.492 --> 05:28.961
That's the difference
between all of you and me!

05:28.995 --> 05:31.263
The day I tap out is the day I die!

05:31.297 --> 05:32.731
[chuckles]

05:32.765 --> 05:35.199
[breathing heavily]

05:35.234 --> 05:36.334
[groans]

05:36.369 --> 05:38.636
Here. Drink this.

05:38.671 --> 05:40.772
Alex, you were great.

05:40.806 --> 05:43.007
That cop totally bought it.

05:43.041 --> 05:44.208
[sighs]

05:44.243 --> 05:45.777
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling your mom.

05:45.811 --> 05:47.311
No, no, no. Please, please, please.

05:47.346 --> 05:48.780
If she finds out, she'll kill me.

05:48.830 --> 05:49.663
Molly, I can't not call her.

05:49.713 --> 05:50.847
- She's my friend.
- Come on.

05:50.883 --> 05:51.849
You know how she is.

05:51.884 --> 05:52.984
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

05:53.018 --> 05:54.318
Um, how about I sleep on the couch,

05:54.386 --> 05:55.953
and then I will head home in the morning?

05:59.091 --> 06:00.992
She already thinks I'm sleeping at Jenn's.

06:01.059 --> 06:01.993
You are unbelievable.

06:02.060 --> 06:03.627
[knock on door]

06:08.933 --> 06:10.267
Dana: Where is she?

06:10.301 --> 06:12.569
- Mom?
- I am, unfortunately.

06:12.637 --> 06:14.004
Dana, I was trying to call you.

06:14.071 --> 06:16.940
- I used the find my phone app.
- You bugged my phone?!

06:19.243 --> 06:20.644
[sniffs]

06:20.678 --> 06:23.213
Oh, you are so busted.

06:25.000 --> 06:31.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:35.121 --> 06:37.287
So, she's your go-to fantasy mom?

06:37.355 --> 06:39.923
[sighs] No, I just didn't
want the police waking you up.

06:39.991 --> 06:42.092
No. So, instead, you chose to wake up Alex.

06:42.159 --> 06:43.392
She's like my cool aunt.

06:43.460 --> 06:44.961
Well, you owe her an apology.

06:45.029 --> 06:47.530
- For what?
- For implicating her in all of this.

06:47.598 --> 06:48.464
Dana, I'm okay.

06:48.532 --> 06:50.066
You know, getting drunk

06:50.101 --> 06:52.368
isn't exactly a major felony, mom.

06:52.436 --> 06:54.070
Lying to the police
is lying to the police, kiddo.

06:54.138 --> 06:55.070
<i>You</i> did it.

06:55.105 --> 06:57.240
Remember when you got hammered

06:57.274 --> 06:59.509
and you threw that rock
right through our front window?

06:59.576 --> 07:01.710
- That was different.
- How?

07:01.778 --> 07:03.812
- I don't know. It just was.
- Oh, wait!

07:03.880 --> 07:05.748
Don't play the cancer card too early, mom.

07:09.953 --> 07:11.020
See that?

07:11.054 --> 07:13.488
See how she has this amazing ability

07:13.556 --> 07:15.323
to jujitsu any situation?

07:15.391 --> 07:17.492
- She learned from the best.
- She what...

07:17.560 --> 07:18.761
What is that supposed to mean?

07:22.932 --> 07:24.599
- Where'd you get the booze, huh?
- [sighs]

07:24.634 --> 07:25.868
Was it that Greyson kid?

07:25.935 --> 07:27.835
The one who cleans his ears
with his car keys?

07:27.903 --> 07:29.904
Why do you have to get
to the bottom of everything?

07:29.938 --> 07:32.340
- Because this is serious.
- Alex, I'm gonna be sick.

07:32.408 --> 07:34.008
Bedroom.

07:36.779 --> 07:38.413
[sighs]

07:38.447 --> 07:40.549
Isn't this fun?

07:40.616 --> 07:41.883
Yeah.

07:43.486 --> 07:44.952
[monitor beeping]

07:52.260 --> 07:54.261
12 years old,

07:54.296 --> 07:57.631
and she legs it across town just
to give me a hug before surgery.

07:57.666 --> 07:58.900
Rian: - Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

07:58.967 --> 08:00.701
Well, there's a lot
of healing power in a hug.

08:02.704 --> 08:05.339
Dr. Bell is the one
who's gonna fix my heart.

08:05.373 --> 08:08.008
I am. And this is Dr. Larouche.
He will be assisting me.

08:08.042 --> 08:09.577
You guys can call me Rian.

08:09.611 --> 08:12.713
You said it was nothing,
and now you need two doctors to fix it?

08:12.747 --> 08:15.249
Well, an aneurysmectomy
is a complicated procedure.

08:15.283 --> 08:16.684
Giselle: How complicated?

08:16.718 --> 08:19.953
You already have a pacemaker
and take six pills a day.

08:19.987 --> 08:23.223
Well, there's a piece of muscle
on my heart that isn't working,

08:23.257 --> 08:25.192
and these doctors are gonna fix it.

08:25.226 --> 08:26.326
How?

08:28.295 --> 08:31.031
Well, I'm gonna take that piece
of the heart that's not working,

08:31.065 --> 08:32.265
and I'm gonna snip it out

08:32.299 --> 08:34.200
so that the rest of the heart
can do its job.

08:34.235 --> 08:36.068
Don't worry.
We'll... we'll stitch it right back up.

08:36.102 --> 08:37.770
Your mother's heart will be
a lot better afterwards.

08:37.804 --> 08:39.539
Well, right now, I'm just her foster mother,

08:39.573 --> 08:43.509
but we put the paperwork in
to make it official, didn't we?

08:43.544 --> 08:46.011
- Yep.
- Yeah.

08:46.079 --> 08:47.447
So she needs to live.

08:47.514 --> 08:49.749
Of course I'm gonna live, right?

08:49.783 --> 08:51.617
I'm highly confident.

08:51.651 --> 08:52.852
That's not a yes.

08:52.886 --> 08:54.353
You can't do this...

08:54.387 --> 08:56.789
not if there's a 1% chance that you can die.

08:56.857 --> 08:58.690
[sighs] You can't.

09:00.727 --> 09:04.930
Understand, I'm all the support
she has in the world.

09:15.308 --> 09:18.009
- You did okay in there.
- [chuckles]

09:18.043 --> 09:20.479
Yeah, well, uh...

09:20.513 --> 09:21.880
She reminds me of my sister.

09:21.914 --> 09:23.447
Yeah, I'm not really interested.

09:23.515 --> 09:25.750
Okay, I'll see you in the O.R.

09:25.818 --> 09:27.919
Can you move your fingers?

09:27.953 --> 09:29.821
Give me a thumbs up.

09:29.855 --> 09:31.589
An "okay" sign.

09:31.657 --> 09:33.691
Yeah, dÃ©jÃÂ  vu.

09:33.759 --> 09:34.893
What were you thinking?

09:34.960 --> 09:36.560
From now on, you do not fight

09:36.595 --> 09:37.962
unless you're getting paid.

09:37.997 --> 09:40.230
How'd that floor taste?
You want another bite?

09:40.299 --> 09:43.033
Tammy! I'm getting tired of your trash talk.

09:43.067 --> 09:44.302
Can you close that curtain, please?

09:44.369 --> 09:46.604
Noelle trains both of us.

09:46.638 --> 09:48.539
You know, when you get beat
by someone with one arm,

09:48.607 --> 09:49.674
it's time to quit.

09:49.708 --> 09:52.510
This is just a stepping stone for me.

09:52.577 --> 09:54.712
Tammy thinks that makes me
an affront to the sport.

09:54.746 --> 09:56.947
Well, you both seem
a little high-strung to me.

09:57.015 --> 09:58.882
[scoffs] She calls me a drama queen.

09:58.950 --> 10:00.884
You should see her
after a fight. [chuckles]

10:00.952 --> 10:02.452
She collapses onto the canvas

10:02.520 --> 10:04.254
like she's given it all she's got.

10:04.322 --> 10:05.655
Crowd just eats it up.

10:05.723 --> 10:08.826
I'm gonna keep you for observation, Kara.

10:08.893 --> 10:11.161
A quick word?

10:14.699 --> 10:16.299
We can keep them separated for now,

10:16.334 --> 10:19.836
but, um, this rivalry
seems to be problematic.

10:19.903 --> 10:22.472
Well, there's nothing wrong
with a little healthy competition.

10:22.540 --> 10:25.742
Yeah, I think the key word there
is "healthy."

10:25.810 --> 10:27.243
And, uh, Tammy over there

10:27.311 --> 10:29.111
doesn't seem to know when to stop.

10:29.179 --> 10:31.881
No, she doesn't.

10:33.317 --> 10:35.084
Most of our hospital fights
involve you and Joel.

10:35.152 --> 10:37.053
I've never really seen
anything like that before.

10:39.056 --> 10:40.656
Hey, you ever hear of grade your M.D.?

10:40.724 --> 10:42.325
Yes.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.193
Yeah, I made the mistake
of finding out my score.

10:44.228 --> 10:45.961
Well, no one ever likes their E.R. doctor.

10:46.028 --> 10:48.764
The only review I have on there is "awful."

10:48.798 --> 10:50.332
What did it say?

10:50.367 --> 10:51.600
"Awful."

10:51.634 --> 10:55.504
Except it was misspelled
with an "h"... "hawful."

10:55.572 --> 10:57.939
- What's your number?
- 12. What's yours?

10:57.974 --> 10:58.940
3 1/2.

10:58.975 --> 10:59.941
Yeah, that's...

10:59.976 --> 11:02.110
- Hawful.
- Hawful. Yeah.

11:02.144 --> 11:06.647
So, I, um, paged psych,
spoke to three police officers,

11:06.682 --> 11:08.649
and, um, filled out an incident report.

11:10.219 --> 11:12.020
So, next time you're angry,

11:12.054 --> 11:14.522
why don't you try just
counting backwards from 50?

11:14.556 --> 11:19.260
50, 49, 48, 47, 46...

11:19.294 --> 11:21.763
Can I get some gauze here, please?

11:25.100 --> 11:26.333
You know, it's the old

11:26.368 --> 11:28.536
she tells me she's sleeping
at Jenn's, and...

11:28.570 --> 11:30.738
and Jenn tells her parents
that she's sleeping over at your place.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.339
Exactly.

11:32.374 --> 11:35.309
And I have to say, it... it's not that...

11:35.343 --> 11:36.576
that she got caught. I mean

11:36.611 --> 11:39.479
[chuckling] hell,
that's a rite of passage.

11:41.182 --> 11:43.550
It's that she didn't call <i>me.</i>

11:45.053 --> 11:47.788
- Maybe she just panicked.
- I guess, but...

11:47.855 --> 11:49.290
I mean, seriously. [chuckles]

11:49.324 --> 11:50.857
Am I that intimidating?

11:50.892 --> 11:52.492
Uh, a little bit.

11:52.527 --> 11:55.962
Though, I tell you, I find out
this Greyson kid was part of it,

11:56.030 --> 11:58.364
and I will hunt him down
and I will teach him chivalry.

11:58.433 --> 12:01.234
Okay, see, now, that is a little bit scary.

12:02.570 --> 12:03.570
You want?

12:03.604 --> 12:06.272
No, I'm good.

12:06.340 --> 12:08.874
Actually, I am going to go check on Molly.

12:10.277 --> 12:12.007
Great. While cool auntie does that,

12:12.057 --> 12:14.280
battle-ax mommy's gonna swill chardonnay

12:14.315 --> 12:15.481
and snoop on her phone.

12:16.650 --> 12:18.751
Get... get that out of my face.

12:22.423 --> 12:24.123
So, do you remember hitting your head

12:24.158 --> 12:26.358
or, more likely, your head getting hit?

12:26.426 --> 12:28.527
Please.

12:28.595 --> 12:30.429
Kara can't even hurt my feelings.

12:30.497 --> 12:31.797
[sighs]

12:31.832 --> 12:34.333
Listen, at the risk of having
my nose flattened, um,

12:34.400 --> 12:36.201
maybe if you could rein in your emotions,

12:36.269 --> 12:37.903
you'd be a more disciplined fighter.

12:37.971 --> 12:40.072
- I do what I do.
- And you don't care what people think?

12:42.408 --> 12:43.808
Come on.

12:43.876 --> 12:46.044
Wanting to be liked is one of
the most primal things there is.

12:46.112 --> 12:48.347
The need to breathe when
you're in a triangle choke...

12:48.414 --> 12:49.647
- that's primal.
- [chuckles]

12:49.715 --> 12:52.484
You always been this, uh, cheerful?

12:53.752 --> 12:56.455
My old man was a drunk,

12:56.522 --> 12:58.623
took his failures out on mom.

12:58.691 --> 13:01.793
I trained three years
to stop him, and I did.

13:01.827 --> 13:03.761
Now he hates my guts,

13:03.796 --> 13:05.497
and you know how that makes me feel?

13:07.666 --> 13:09.433
Great.

13:09.502 --> 13:10.802
- [groans]
- You sore?

13:10.870 --> 13:12.570
- Yeah.
- Well, get comfortable

13:12.605 --> 13:14.605
'cause I'm putting you on concussion watch

13:14.672 --> 13:15.672
for the next 24 hours.

13:15.707 --> 13:16.907
Come on.

13:16.941 --> 13:18.342
Kara never landed a punch.

13:18.377 --> 13:19.810
Listen, I don't mean to alarm you,

13:19.844 --> 13:22.113
but, uh, a second impact before
an earlier concussion subsides

13:22.180 --> 13:23.247
can be catastrophic.

13:23.315 --> 13:25.416
[sighs]

13:25.484 --> 13:28.185
It's just a nosebleed.
I always get nosebleeds.

13:29.687 --> 13:33.624
Tammy, no one should always get nosebleeds.

13:46.370 --> 13:47.537
I'm being sued.

13:47.571 --> 13:50.173
We're doctors. It goes with the job.

13:50.207 --> 13:52.042
Yeah, but this guy hasn't even
left the hospital yet.

13:52.109 --> 13:53.343
He's my patient in bed 2.

13:53.377 --> 13:55.478
[sighs]

13:55.513 --> 13:57.280
Presumably, he has a name.

13:57.348 --> 13:59.482
That would imply he's human.

13:59.550 --> 14:00.917
Elliot Stout.

14:00.984 --> 14:02.618
He's one of these bay street litigators

14:02.653 --> 14:04.153
who they keep locked up in a cage.

14:04.187 --> 14:06.188
Well, we have our own lawyers,

14:06.256 --> 14:08.357
and they'll defend you vigorously.

14:14.397 --> 14:16.131
Honestly...

14:16.166 --> 14:18.067
I think he's only staying alive
out of sheer spite.

14:18.101 --> 14:20.635
Okay, you might not want to let
your inner voice talk out loud.

14:20.670 --> 14:22.637
Come up and meet him. I'm not exaggerating.

14:22.672 --> 14:24.806
The guy's a life-support system
for a bad mood.

14:24.840 --> 14:26.775
[elevator bell dings]

14:33.083 --> 14:36.218
Mr. Stout? Dawn Bell, chief of surgery.

14:36.252 --> 14:37.385
Well...

14:37.453 --> 14:39.588
I'd be charmed if I wasn't so fatally ill.

14:39.622 --> 14:42.090
And yet you still find time to work.

14:42.124 --> 14:45.359
This isn't work.
This is by way of being a hobby.

14:45.394 --> 14:47.395
I understand that you served
Dr. Tolliver with legal papers.

14:47.429 --> 14:51.399
After 10 days in residence
with no sign of improvement,

14:51.433 --> 14:52.934
I'd be remiss not to.

14:52.969 --> 14:56.070
Mr. Stout, if you had questions
about your care,

14:56.105 --> 14:57.405
you could have spoken with me.

14:57.439 --> 15:00.374
I find it so much easier
to get answers from people

15:00.409 --> 15:01.609
when they're under oath.

15:01.676 --> 15:05.313
C. difficile is a very difficult
bug to manage...

15:05.347 --> 15:07.181
hence the name "difficult."

15:07.216 --> 15:09.016
- I've read the literature.
- Well, then you'll know

15:09.084 --> 15:12.519
that Dr. Tolliver is an expert
in its containment and cure,

15:12.553 --> 15:14.922
so suing her is shortsighted.

15:14.956 --> 15:16.056
You're right.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.792
That's why I've decided to sue you, too.

15:18.827 --> 15:21.629
Your legal notice is there
in the printer tray.

15:27.235 --> 15:30.069
Speaking, as we say, without prejudice,

15:30.104 --> 15:32.205
I might be persuaded to drop my suit

15:32.240 --> 15:35.375
should an internal inquiry
discover who stole my pillows.

15:35.443 --> 15:37.744
Your pillows?

15:37.811 --> 15:39.679
I want them returned.

15:39.747 --> 15:41.281
They were mother's.

15:49.990 --> 15:51.323
[sighs]

15:52.960 --> 15:54.360
You can't go in there.

15:55.763 --> 15:56.796
I got him a yogurt.

15:58.365 --> 16:00.266
Catch.

16:08.675 --> 16:11.610
Well, is he gonna drop the lawsuit?

16:11.678 --> 16:14.480
Any chance you could put him
in a medically induced coma?

16:14.548 --> 16:17.649
Don't think I haven't thought of it.

16:21.353 --> 16:22.654
[sighs]

16:22.689 --> 16:24.856
Shahir: Yeah, your patient's
head C.T.... it's clear.

16:24.924 --> 16:26.091
So, no sign of concussion?

16:26.159 --> 16:27.425
No.

16:27.493 --> 16:29.360
Okay. So, tell me.

16:29.428 --> 16:31.963
What was the temperature
on your thermometer?

16:32.031 --> 16:33.298
My what?

16:33.332 --> 16:35.833
Your hotness score.

16:35.901 --> 16:37.502
Shahir, what the hell are you talking about?

16:37.570 --> 16:38.836
Grade your M.D....

16:38.870 --> 16:40.471
the little icon in
the bottom right of the screen.

16:40.506 --> 16:41.772
Right here. Look.

16:41.840 --> 16:43.408
Patients rate your hotness.

16:44.677 --> 16:46.544
I got "smokin' surgeon."

16:47.946 --> 16:50.047
I'm smokin', Charlie.

16:50.082 --> 16:51.682
- You are smokin'...
- Mm-hmm. Thank you.

16:51.750 --> 16:53.017
- Something.
- Hmm?

16:53.051 --> 16:54.484
Dr. Harris, you have to come with me.

16:54.519 --> 16:55.853
It's your cage fighter.

17:05.196 --> 17:08.064
I've got big guns on a normal
day, but this is absurd.

17:08.098 --> 17:09.499
Okay.

17:09.534 --> 17:10.800
[inhales sharply] Aah.

17:10.835 --> 17:11.901
[sighs]

17:13.605 --> 17:14.904
There's no pulse.

17:15.740 --> 17:17.273
- Is that a joke?
- There must be arterial damage.

17:17.308 --> 17:19.309
We've got to restore blood flow,
or she's gonna lose the arm.

17:19.344 --> 17:20.544
I'll book an O.R.

17:20.578 --> 17:21.845
You're gonna cut my arm off?

17:21.878 --> 17:24.914
- Not if I can help it.
- Aah!

17:24.949 --> 17:25.982
I'm not getting in that thing.

17:26.016 --> 17:28.251
Tammy, you can't walk to the O.R.

17:28.285 --> 17:29.385
No, I'm serious.

17:29.419 --> 17:31.020
Get that thing away from me.

17:31.055 --> 17:32.321
My legs are fine.

17:33.290 --> 17:34.791
You want me to kick you
in the liver to prove it?

17:41.745 --> 17:43.212
[clears throat]

17:43.247 --> 17:45.114
How's she doing?

17:45.149 --> 17:47.250
- Fragile.
- Hmm.

17:47.284 --> 17:49.252
Well, she's in there denouncing me.

17:49.286 --> 17:50.686
Nope.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.655
Really? 'Cause you were
in there for a while.

17:54.491 --> 17:55.458
We were throwing up.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.025
What?

17:57.060 --> 17:59.261
Yeah. We took turns holding
each other's hair back,

17:59.295 --> 18:01.764
which would have been sweet
if it wasn't so disgusting.

18:02.966 --> 18:04.567
I know her excuse. What's yours?

18:04.601 --> 18:07.002
I thought you might have guessed by now.

18:07.036 --> 18:08.370
You aren't.

18:08.404 --> 18:10.038
I am. [chuckles]

18:10.073 --> 18:12.807
Oh, Alex, that's so great!

18:12.875 --> 18:14.309
I mean, it is, right? You're happy?

18:14.377 --> 18:16.711
Yeah, I mean, after I got over the shock,

18:16.779 --> 18:19.547
I-I'm really happy. [chuckles]

18:19.615 --> 18:23.051
Ohh, honey, congratulations.

18:23.086 --> 18:25.119
Thank you.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.355
So...

18:27.389 --> 18:29.791
who's the hmm-hmm?

18:31.694 --> 18:32.927
An orthopedic surgeon.

18:34.296 --> 18:37.331
Do he... does they... do they know?

18:37.399 --> 18:38.666
No.

18:38.701 --> 18:40.134
You're the first person I told,

18:40.202 --> 18:41.902
which makes it feel so much more real.

18:41.970 --> 18:42.936
[chuckles]

18:42.971 --> 18:44.571
Oh.

18:44.639 --> 18:49.010
Well, it's just gonna get
realer and realer. [chuckles]

18:49.077 --> 18:51.879
Yeah, I-I kind of can't wait.

18:51.913 --> 18:53.347
[monitor beeping]

18:55.083 --> 18:56.984
She's in her happy place.

18:58.653 --> 19:00.387
[saw buzzing]

19:01.723 --> 19:03.323
So, do you need me now?

19:03.391 --> 19:05.826
Come back in a half hour.
I got to get through the sternum first.

19:05.894 --> 19:07.594
Sure thing.

19:07.662 --> 19:11.064
Hey, uh, I think you have
a little bit of an audience.

19:12.867 --> 19:14.401
Dawn: How did she get in there?

19:14.468 --> 19:16.769
I don't know. I guess someone
left the gallery door unlocked.

19:16.803 --> 19:19.005
Yeah, well, she can't be up there.

19:19.073 --> 19:20.106
What's her name again?

19:20.141 --> 19:21.441
Giselle.

19:22.510 --> 19:26.812
Giselle, you need to come down
from there, okay?

19:26.847 --> 19:28.515
I'll get her.

19:30.617 --> 19:32.351
Whoever left that gallery door unlocked...

19:32.385 --> 19:34.053
there's a reward for their head.

19:38.425 --> 19:42.795
This isn't how I ever imagined it...

19:42.863 --> 19:44.864
you know, doing it on my own.

19:44.898 --> 19:46.798
But it's happened, and I can do it, right?

19:46.832 --> 19:47.966
Of course you can do it.

19:48.034 --> 19:49.768
I just keep hearing my mom's voice saying,

19:49.835 --> 19:51.103
"you can't have it all."

19:52.472 --> 19:53.939
A job and a kid is not having it all.

19:53.973 --> 19:55.907
It's just two things.

19:55.942 --> 19:59.811
And besides, you won't be alone.
You have phenomenal friends.

19:59.879 --> 20:01.180
I do.

20:02.048 --> 20:06.517
Speaking of which, um,
I've been wanting to ask you.

20:06.586 --> 20:07.852
Yeah?

20:07.887 --> 20:10.488
Would you be my baby's godmother?

20:10.522 --> 20:12.057
[glass shatters]

20:13.593 --> 20:15.526
What the hell?

20:16.829 --> 20:18.196
Molly?

20:19.164 --> 20:20.864
Molly?

20:20.899 --> 20:22.666
Molly!

20:22.701 --> 20:24.868
- She's locked herself in. Can you open that?
Molly: - Hang on a second.

20:24.903 --> 20:27.871
- Chill out, mom.
Dana: - Oh, my god.

20:30.309 --> 20:32.543
- Mom, you can't just barge in like that.
- I'm sorry.

20:32.578 --> 20:34.378
[sighs] I got scared, all right?

20:34.413 --> 20:36.279
Sorry, Alex. Uh, I-I broke your bowl.

20:36.314 --> 20:39.282
You can't just take a bath
in someone else's tub.

20:39.317 --> 20:40.317
What are you thinking?

20:40.351 --> 20:42.219
Can you just give me one minute?

20:46.357 --> 20:49.927
A first-year resident
ever spoke to me like that...

20:49.961 --> 20:52.062
Yeah, they wouldn't make it to second year.

20:52.097 --> 20:53.463
But with her, I don't know.

20:53.498 --> 20:55.232
Somehow, it all goes out the window.

20:55.266 --> 20:56.600
Ugh!

20:59.570 --> 21:01.070
[monitor beeping]

21:03.274 --> 21:06.075
So, I think I figured you out, Tammy.

21:06.110 --> 21:07.076
Oh, yeah?

21:07.111 --> 21:09.045
Yep. You're the heel, right?

21:09.079 --> 21:11.848
People cheer to see me lose. You got it.

21:11.882 --> 21:15.551
Well, this is a hospital, not the octagon.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.220
Are you on grade your M.D.?

21:18.255 --> 21:20.489
Oh, good lord. Why?

21:20.524 --> 21:21.858
Cut off my arm,

21:21.892 --> 21:24.861
let's just say I won't be able
to score you above a 5.

21:24.895 --> 21:26.828
We're ready to put you under now, Tammy.

21:26.863 --> 21:28.497
Knock me out.

21:29.533 --> 21:31.567
I bet you've never said that before.

21:31.601 --> 21:32.901
Hey, doc.

21:35.772 --> 21:37.072
Don't let me lose my arm.

21:38.441 --> 21:41.009
[sighs] I always watch out for her.

21:41.077 --> 21:42.343
I called the ambulance this time

21:42.378 --> 21:44.046
even though she told me it was just a cramp.

21:44.080 --> 21:45.513
And you did the right thing.

21:45.548 --> 21:46.915
So, why can't I watch?

21:46.949 --> 21:48.950
We never let family watch.
It's a little too emotional.

21:49.018 --> 21:50.351
Well, I can hack it.

21:50.419 --> 21:53.088
But I can't do my job with you
looking over my shoulder.

21:53.156 --> 21:54.455
Do you understand?

21:54.490 --> 21:57.258
Mr. Stout told me it was
my right, and he's a lawyer.

21:57.293 --> 22:00.395
Mr. Stout does not control
the policy in this hospital. I do.

22:00.462 --> 22:01.429
And you can't stay.

22:01.497 --> 22:02.564
Okay, I'll wait out here.

22:02.631 --> 22:03.864
You know, it's a pretty long operation.

22:03.932 --> 22:05.900
Where are you staying while Leila's in here?

22:05.967 --> 22:08.869
It's called, like,
a respite house or something.

22:08.937 --> 22:10.205
It's run by the city.

22:11.073 --> 22:13.274
- Do you have 20 bucks?
- What for?

22:13.342 --> 22:14.242
- Put her in a cab.
- No, no, no, no, no.

22:14.292 --> 22:16.394
You can't put a 12-year-old in a cab.
It's after midnight.

22:16.523 --> 22:18.830
- No, no, no, no, no, no. I'll drive her.
- But I need you.

22:18.880 --> 22:20.547
I'll be back before
you're through the sternum.

22:20.615 --> 22:22.083
Don't worry. Don't worry.

22:22.150 --> 22:24.018
Let's go.

22:24.086 --> 22:26.420
You pick your cards right, I'm
gonna let you pick the music.

22:26.487 --> 22:28.355
Sharpe: Her face is flushed.

22:28.423 --> 22:30.091
That still can't be from the fight.

22:30.669 --> 22:33.162
It could be mat burn.
In MMA, you go down,

22:33.212 --> 22:34.628
- and they just keep hitting you.
- Mm.

22:34.662 --> 22:36.062
Kind of like life.

22:36.097 --> 22:39.099
He's in a bad mood because of
his grade your M.D. scores.

22:39.166 --> 22:40.492
No, I'm not, actually.

22:40.708 --> 22:43.069
It only takes one bad review
to mess with your head.

22:43.137 --> 22:45.004
Imagine 23. [chuckles]

22:45.072 --> 22:46.940
Want to boost your score? Do what I do.

22:47.007 --> 22:48.808
Create fake accounts and rate yourself.

22:50.410 --> 22:52.444
All your patients are unconscious, Wayne.

22:52.511 --> 22:53.478
[chuckles]

22:53.546 --> 22:54.747
If I'm doing my job well.

22:54.781 --> 22:56.982
[sighs]

22:58.618 --> 23:01.153
Oh, this isn't good.

23:01.221 --> 23:03.756
The skin should bounce back.
Hers is like butter.

23:03.823 --> 23:05.958
Uh, we've got a bigger problem.
She's bleeding.

23:06.025 --> 23:07.092
[monitors beeping]

23:07.160 --> 23:08.426
It's coming from her G.I. tract.

23:08.461 --> 23:10.194
Pulse erratic. She's going into shock.

23:10.263 --> 23:11.763
What the hell is happening?

23:11.797 --> 23:13.131
Tammy: <i>Like I said...</i>

23:13.198 --> 23:15.233
<i>the day I tap out
is the day I die.</i>

23:20.552 --> 23:23.053
Molly: So, I text Bri, and I
tell her I'm looking to party.

23:23.121 --> 23:25.155
And she tells me to call Riley,

23:25.189 --> 23:26.991
and I'm like, "well, who's Riley?"

23:27.025 --> 23:30.494
So I call the number, and I'm like,

23:30.529 --> 23:32.295
"Riley, I hear there's a party."

23:32.330 --> 23:33.397
And since I mentioned Bri's name,

23:33.431 --> 23:34.498
she tells me the where and when.

23:34.532 --> 23:35.714
It's all about trust, right?

23:35.948 --> 23:37.027
Right.

23:37.902 --> 23:38.868
Are you high?

23:38.903 --> 23:39.869
What?

23:39.904 --> 23:41.304
No.

23:41.339 --> 23:42.605
Look at me.

23:44.675 --> 23:47.544
I said look at me.

23:48.780 --> 23:50.014
Her eyes are pinned.

23:50.048 --> 23:51.381
So I smoke a bit. It's nothing.

23:51.416 --> 23:53.450
No, your pupils are pinned, not dilated.

23:53.484 --> 23:55.552
It's not weed. What are you taking?

23:55.586 --> 23:57.521
It's like your glass of wine after dinner.

23:57.555 --> 24:00.424
You don't have any opiates in
your bathroom cabinet, do you?

24:00.458 --> 24:03.026
- Absolutely not.
- I didn't steal Alex's drugs.

24:03.061 --> 24:06.763
The other day when Maggie said
you stole those pills...

24:06.797 --> 24:08.665
- I didn't!
- I don't believe you!

24:08.699 --> 24:11.701
- All right, that's it. We are going home.
- Mom, relax.

24:11.735 --> 24:13.570
No, you go and you get your stuff right now

24:13.604 --> 24:14.771
because we are going.

24:14.805 --> 24:16.472
No! Stop!

24:17.608 --> 24:19.842
I'm not going anywhere
with you. You're so judgmental!

24:19.877 --> 24:21.444
Molly, you get back here! [door slams]

24:21.478 --> 24:23.479
[sighs]

24:31.888 --> 24:34.056
Still want me to be your baby's godmother?

24:34.124 --> 24:35.391
[chuckles lightly]

24:39.729 --> 24:41.863
Why are you leaving the cage?

24:44.901 --> 24:46.735
I can't operate on your arm
if you're not stable,

24:46.803 --> 24:48.070
so what aren't you telling me?

24:48.104 --> 24:50.072
[sighs] Nothing.

24:51.841 --> 24:53.141
In surgery,

24:53.175 --> 24:54.876
a patient's body should
produce steroids naturally,

24:54.944 --> 24:56.777
but if they've been taking them...

24:58.714 --> 24:59.847
You want to hit me?

24:59.881 --> 25:02.584
- What's the matter?
- I can't make a fist.

25:02.651 --> 25:04.085
This can't be happening.

25:04.153 --> 25:05.953
You're gonna lose the arm
if we don't help each other.

25:06.021 --> 25:08.656
If I can't fight, there's no point.

25:11.160 --> 25:12.660
Where are you going?!

25:12.728 --> 25:14.495
If you won't help me,
I'll find someone who will.

25:16.197 --> 25:19.199
Was Tammy taking steroids
or drugs of any kind?

25:19.267 --> 25:21.135
No.

25:21.169 --> 25:23.137
[sighs] Look, I'm not gonna rat on you.

25:23.204 --> 25:25.840
We're just running out of time
to save the arm.

25:25.907 --> 25:28.009
Do what you got to do.

25:28.076 --> 25:30.710
After tonight, no matter what
happens, I am done with her.

25:30.745 --> 25:31.911
<i>What?</i>

25:31.979 --> 25:33.313
<i>I gave her the best years of my life.</i>

25:33.381 --> 25:35.482
What about her future?

25:35.550 --> 25:36.783
She has no future.

25:36.851 --> 25:38.084
Look, I can save the arm

25:38.119 --> 25:39.986
if we can just figure out
what's wrong with her.

25:40.054 --> 25:43.790
What's wrong with her
is that nobody likes her.

25:43.858 --> 25:47.226
Her only shtick is collapsing
after every fight.

25:47.294 --> 25:49.162
It wears thin.

25:49.196 --> 25:51.297
She collapses, and she can't get up?

25:51.365 --> 25:53.499
She can't, won't,
doesn't want to. I don't know.

25:53.534 --> 25:55.434
It's not my problem.

25:55.469 --> 25:57.303
You mean she <i>can't</i> get up?

25:57.337 --> 25:58.972
<i>No, I can't.</i>

26:07.747 --> 26:09.582
Okay, the moment of truth.

26:09.616 --> 26:10.716
Let's take her off of bypass.

26:10.750 --> 26:12.718
Okay. Leaving blood.

26:16.523 --> 26:18.391
We're down to half full.

26:22.762 --> 26:23.796
[sighs]

26:23.830 --> 26:24.997
[monitor beeps]

26:25.031 --> 26:26.364
Her heart's not picking up the slack.

26:26.399 --> 26:28.167
This isn't gonna work.
Let's put her back on bypass.

26:28.201 --> 26:29.634
Wait. Should we just
give her some more time?

26:29.669 --> 26:31.737
I've been down this road before.
This heart is toast.

26:31.771 --> 26:32.705
What... what if we zap it?

26:32.739 --> 26:34.339
It's not gonna work.

26:34.373 --> 26:35.507
But her numbers are stabilizing.

26:35.541 --> 26:37.375
Her ejection fraction is less than 15.

26:37.410 --> 26:38.543
Her heart is too damaged.

26:38.578 --> 26:40.579
There's got to be another way.

26:40.613 --> 26:42.380
The only way to save her
is to rip out her heart.

26:45.918 --> 26:47.085
[knock on door]

26:52.457 --> 26:53.725
[sighs]

27:01.834 --> 27:03.601
I don't have a problem, okay?

27:03.635 --> 27:04.969
She's gonna blow this

27:05.003 --> 27:07.671
way out of proportion like she always does.

27:07.706 --> 27:11.342
She makes everything her problem to solve.

27:11.376 --> 27:12.776
I'm her problem to solve.

27:12.810 --> 27:15.178
- She's just trying to help.
- I don't need help.

27:15.247 --> 27:16.447
I think you might.

27:17.849 --> 27:19.350
I thought you were on my side.

27:19.384 --> 27:22.386
Molly, if you're stealing drugs,
you need help.

27:22.454 --> 27:25.222
I can't talk to her about anything.

27:26.257 --> 27:27.390
Have you tried?

27:29.193 --> 27:30.794
My teeny, tiny, little life

27:30.862 --> 27:32.695
means nothing when she could die.

27:32.764 --> 27:36.066
Molly, she's not gonna die.

27:36.134 --> 27:37.533
She's cancer-free.

27:37.601 --> 27:39.970
Chances are I'm gonna get it, too,

27:40.004 --> 27:43.105
so might as well party while I can.

27:43.140 --> 27:46.008
Well, you can't hide out in here.

27:46.042 --> 27:47.910
You need to talk to your mom.

27:49.980 --> 27:51.881
Why are you being so hard on me?

27:51.948 --> 27:54.384
Because I'm not your cool aunt.

27:54.418 --> 27:56.719
Yeah, well, I liked you better
when you were.

27:59.222 --> 28:00.455
How's she doing?

28:00.490 --> 28:01.657
Sharpe: Stable.

28:01.691 --> 28:04.293
Okay, round two. Surgery back on.

28:04.327 --> 28:06.128
How do we know she won't crash again?

28:06.196 --> 28:07.997
Because now we know she's been
taking prednisone for lupus.

28:08.064 --> 28:09.865
Am I right? Right?

28:11.168 --> 28:12.401
Right.

28:12.435 --> 28:13.869
Let's give her a stress dose
of corticosteroids.

28:13.904 --> 28:15.304
Then we can save her arm.

28:15.338 --> 28:17.506
There's nothing in her medical
history that suggests lupus.

28:17.573 --> 28:19.308
That's because she's been hiding it.

28:19.375 --> 28:22.611
Nosebleeds, stiffness, butterfly
rash... they're all symptoms.

28:22.679 --> 28:24.513
But there's no definitive test for lupus.

28:24.580 --> 28:26.114
It's a diagnosis of exclusion.

28:27.883 --> 28:31.853
<i>I was diagnosed when I was 15.</i>

28:31.921 --> 28:33.688
<i>They told me I'd never
get out of a wheelchair.</i>

28:33.755 --> 28:35.190
- Yeah, I'm sure.
- How?

28:35.224 --> 28:36.623
Just am.

28:36.657 --> 28:37.825
Okay.

28:37.859 --> 28:40.127
If you're not crazy...
and that's a big if...

28:40.195 --> 28:41.795
her arm has been without blood flow

28:41.863 --> 28:43.530
for just way too long.

28:43.597 --> 28:46.366
What can I tell you? [sighs]

28:46.434 --> 28:47.801
She's a fighter.

28:47.869 --> 28:50.304
Loupes.

28:58.137 --> 29:00.571
So, still searching her phone?

29:00.639 --> 29:02.140
You know what I've been thinking?

29:02.174 --> 29:04.075
She's not getting the opiates from school,

29:04.110 --> 29:05.576
so where are they coming from, right?

29:05.644 --> 29:06.711
I can, uh...

29:06.745 --> 29:09.314
Maybe now is not the time to fix it.

29:10.682 --> 29:12.016
What do you mean?

29:12.050 --> 29:16.854
It's just maybe she needs you
to be with her, you know?

29:16.922 --> 29:18.322
Let her know that you're still here.

29:20.792 --> 29:22.493
Yeah.

29:22.528 --> 29:23.794
[monitors beeping]

29:23.829 --> 29:26.430
That saphenous vein is paper-thin.

29:26.464 --> 29:28.565
Yeah, I can see that.

29:28.599 --> 29:29.933
[sighs]

29:29.967 --> 29:31.968
I wouldn't stress your rating.

29:32.003 --> 29:34.704
Though, you may be wondering
why mine is so high.

29:34.739 --> 29:38.008
I am 29. It's the most popular age.

29:38.043 --> 29:40.310
It's when you have the most friends.

29:40.345 --> 29:43.414
They say it's all downhill from there.

29:43.448 --> 29:46.282
Thank you. You can stop comforting me now.

29:47.685 --> 29:49.019
Diameter wide enough?

29:49.053 --> 29:51.354
Let's find out.

29:51.388 --> 29:52.756
Okay. Releasing the clamp.

29:52.790 --> 29:56.225
Watch for pulsatile arterial flow.

29:58.395 --> 30:00.030
- That's a good-looking artery.
- Mm.

30:00.064 --> 30:01.364
[applause]

30:03.300 --> 30:06.202
So, who is the highest-rated
surgeon at Hope Zion?

30:06.236 --> 30:07.336
Don't need to know.

30:07.371 --> 30:09.004
Doesn't need to know.

30:11.608 --> 30:13.109

30:13.143 --> 30:15.044
It's the accent.

30:15.079 --> 30:17.279

employee of the month.

30:30.927 --> 30:33.395
Hey, sweetheart.

30:33.463 --> 30:35.763
Can, um... can we...

30:38.568 --> 30:39.701
Molly.

30:39.735 --> 30:41.069
Molly.

30:41.137 --> 30:42.670
Molly. Oh, my god.

30:42.738 --> 30:43.671
Alex!

30:43.739 --> 30:45.873
- What?
- Oh, my god!

30:45.941 --> 30:47.642
Oh, my god. Molly.

30:47.676 --> 30:50.078
Dana. Dana, you have to
clear her airway, okay?

30:50.112 --> 30:51.545
And then keep her awake.

30:51.580 --> 30:53.447
[breathing heavily] This is Dr. Alex Reid.

30:53.482 --> 30:56.618
I need an ambulance to
1119 Queen West, apartment 508.

30:56.685 --> 30:58.119
Oh, my god. She's burning up.

30:58.186 --> 30:59.253
Where are you going?

30:59.287 --> 31:00.221
I'm getting ice.

31:00.288 --> 31:01.589
She's O.D.'d.

31:01.624 --> 31:04.258
My guess... heroin. She's hyperthermic.

31:04.292 --> 31:05.927
Checking.

31:05.961 --> 31:07.394
She's tachycardic.

31:07.429 --> 31:09.062
Her breathing's shallow. Just get here.

31:09.097 --> 31:11.132
Molly, honey, you got to stay with me, okay?

31:11.199 --> 31:12.866
Look at me. Molly, come on, honey.

31:12.900 --> 31:14.268
We got to cool her down, Alex.

31:14.336 --> 31:15.336
Dana, what are you doing?

31:15.403 --> 31:16.504
We got to cool her down now.

31:16.571 --> 31:18.572
She's gonna go into shock. What?

31:18.640 --> 31:19.740
I've got to do something.

31:19.807 --> 31:20.941
It's okay.

31:20.975 --> 31:22.543
- The ambulance is coming, okay?
- Oh, god.

31:22.611 --> 31:23.810
It's gonna be all right.

31:23.878 --> 31:25.345
There's nothing we can do
until it gets here.

31:25.412 --> 31:27.380
- Baby, come on, come on, come on.
- She's gonna be all right.

31:31.819 --> 31:34.021

[clears throat]

31:35.356 --> 31:38.825
[weakly] What's happened to me?

31:38.893 --> 31:40.527
What's this tube?

31:40.594 --> 31:43.463
That is an LVAD.

31:43.531 --> 31:45.331
It's a left ventricle assist device.

31:45.399 --> 31:46.633
It's helping your heart to beat.

31:46.667 --> 31:49.402
[chuckles] I thought you were confident.

31:51.172 --> 31:53.239
I wasn't able to do
the procedure that I'd hoped.

31:53.307 --> 31:55.175
There was too much decay.

31:55.242 --> 31:57.209
Am I gonna have this forever?

31:57.243 --> 31:58.610
Nope.

31:58.645 --> 32:00.946
It's just temporary until
we can get you a donor heart.

32:01.014 --> 32:03.015
A transplant?

32:03.050 --> 32:04.449
Yep.

32:04.484 --> 32:05.918
[sighs]

32:07.988 --> 32:10.455
I-I have to...

32:11.449 --> 32:14.132
I have to find someone to take Giselle.

32:14.182 --> 32:14.975
You're young.

32:15.025 --> 32:16.161
You're a priority candidate.

32:16.196 --> 32:18.129
[sighs]

32:18.164 --> 32:21.233
I gave up my own.

32:21.267 --> 32:25.870
I was 16 and so stupid.

32:25.938 --> 32:29.140
So stupid.

32:29.175 --> 32:32.410
I never thought I'd get another chance,

32:32.444 --> 32:35.213
and then Giselle...

32:35.280 --> 32:37.248
came to my door.

32:37.282 --> 32:40.585
I think that you need to plan on
being here for a while.

32:40.619 --> 32:42.187
[sobs]

32:42.221 --> 32:45.623
Leila, hope is a big part of recovery.

32:48.460 --> 32:50.561
- Okay.
- Okay?

33:02.006 --> 33:03.974
She took it pretty well.

33:04.008 --> 33:06.576
They usually do.

33:06.611 --> 33:08.245
You were really great in there, by the way.

33:08.279 --> 33:10.413
- Thank you.
- Especially with the kid.

33:10.448 --> 33:11.448
Hmm.

33:11.482 --> 33:14.317
Your sister will be proud.

33:15.987 --> 33:19.456
Yeah, she, um...

33:19.490 --> 33:20.757
she died.

33:22.560 --> 33:23.526
What?

33:23.561 --> 33:25.328
Yeah.

33:25.363 --> 33:28.598
Yeah, she... yeah, she died.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.168
What was her name?

33:34.138 --> 33:35.337
Teresa.

33:36.539 --> 33:37.774
So...

33:37.808 --> 33:41.277
She was 11 years old when she passed.

33:41.311 --> 33:43.980
Uh, cystic fibrosis.

33:47.651 --> 33:51.453
I, um, got this tattoo to remember her.

33:51.521 --> 33:55.223
- And kind of became a doctor, too.
- [chuckles]

33:55.258 --> 33:57.593
Did you just flex your bicep to impress me?

33:58.895 --> 34:00.763
- [chuckles]
- No.

34:00.830 --> 34:01.930
You will be fine.

34:01.964 --> 34:03.465
At ease, Larouche.

34:05.468 --> 34:07.770
Okay, maybe a little bit.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.237
[monitor beeping]

34:09.304 --> 34:13.308
Tox screen says that the heroin
was cut with fentanyl.

34:13.375 --> 34:16.110
Should we give her 2 more
milligrams of naloxone?

34:16.145 --> 34:17.545
Kind of pushing the envelope here.

34:17.579 --> 34:19.614
I mean, if we give her any more,
she could go hypertensive.

34:19.681 --> 34:22.117
Th... there must be
something else that we can do.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.918
Zach handles this sort of thing every day.

34:23.985 --> 34:27.455
[voice breaking] Yeah, I'm...

34:27.523 --> 34:30.090
I just feel so powerless.

34:30.158 --> 34:31.158
I know.

34:31.193 --> 34:33.092
Right now, all we can do is wait.

34:33.128 --> 34:34.094
Yeah.

34:34.161 --> 34:35.396
I'll wait with you.

34:36.831 --> 34:38.232
Thank you.

34:40.335 --> 34:42.636
[sighs]

34:44.150 --> 34:45.984
You sure about this?

34:46.052 --> 34:47.918
I've always looked up to Tammy...

34:47.987 --> 34:49.654
often literally from the mat.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.089
[chuckles]

34:51.123 --> 34:52.491
The way Noelle trash-talked her like that

34:52.558 --> 34:53.725
when she was down...

34:53.759 --> 34:55.460
I guess it made me realize

34:55.495 --> 34:58.130
that neither of us
have anyone in our corner,

34:58.197 --> 35:00.365
except each other.

35:03.636 --> 35:05.369
Tammy, you have a visitor.

35:05.437 --> 35:08.706
You have pay-per-view in here?

35:08.774 --> 35:10.474
Kara.

35:10.509 --> 35:11.643
You've come to gloat.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.044
I've come to tell you

35:13.078 --> 35:15.046
that you'd better hurry up
and get back in the octagon.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.881
[sighs] It could be awhile.

35:17.916 --> 35:20.451
Yeah, well...

35:20.485 --> 35:22.986
until then, how about you train me?

35:23.021 --> 35:25.022
What about Noelle?

35:25.090 --> 35:27.425
I had to let her go.

35:27.492 --> 35:28.859
She's a bit of a heel.

35:28.893 --> 35:30.727
[chuckles]

35:30.762 --> 35:32.563
So it's safe to leave you two alone awhile?

35:33.965 --> 35:35.265
Yeah.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.134

What do you say we let her
sleep until morning, okay?

36:35.492 --> 36:38.460
It's quite the bed you've made here.

36:40.663 --> 36:41.630
Kind of lumpy.

36:45.067 --> 36:46.567
Did you steal these pillows?

36:47.770 --> 36:50.138
They can't be stolen if they
haven't left the hospital.

36:54.810 --> 36:57.678
Giselle, have you been
living here this whole time?

36:59.214 --> 37:00.681
No.

37:02.851 --> 37:04.519
Just the past two days.

37:09.358 --> 37:10.891
You can't sleep here.

when I got sick, I, um... I don't know...

37:44.625 --> 37:49.328
I put blinders on just to get through it.

37:49.362 --> 37:52.765
And I stopped seeing...

being your daughter?

38:14.421 --> 38:18.090
You're smart. You're beautiful.

38:18.124 --> 38:19.290
So are you.

You're perfect,

- You are.
- I'm not.

38:30.169 --> 38:32.537
You are to me.

from the day you were born.

38:35.108 --> 38:36.741

so don't try to convince me otherwise.

Don't even try.

you're gonna go to rehab.

- No. Nonnegotiable...

I hear that Tammy "Armageddon"
owes you a rave review.

40:17.373 --> 40:18.540
- That's awesome.
- âª we're drifting apart âª

40:18.607 --> 40:21.175
âª we're parallel sinking ships âª

40:21.210 --> 40:22.410
I do what I do.

40:22.445 --> 40:25.012
âª you're anxiously reaching out âª

40:25.080 --> 40:31.418
âª but I'm losing my grip âª

40:31.486 --> 40:35.489
âª oh, oh, oh, oh âª

40:35.557 --> 40:37.491
âª you were trying to make it work âª

40:37.559 --> 40:39.626
âª you were sleeping in my shirt âª

40:39.694 --> 40:41.128
âª arcadia âª

40:41.196 --> 40:43.530
âª oh, oh, oh âª

40:43.598 --> 40:47.835
âª sometimes things âª
âª don't come full circle âª

40:47.902 --> 40:51.372
âª sometimes things âª
âª don't come full circle âª

40:51.439 --> 40:53.340
Mm-hmm.

40:53.408 --> 40:55.008
Mm-hmm.

40:56.811 --> 41:00.280
Yeah, well, get here when you can.

41:00.348 --> 41:02.148
No, she's fine.

41:02.183 --> 41:05.218
Really, she's all right.

41:05.253 --> 41:07.420
Okay. Bye-bye.

41:07.454 --> 41:10.223
[sighs]

41:10.291 --> 41:11.591
- Molly's dad?
- Yep.

41:13.361 --> 41:15.495
I just figured I'd spread the worry around.

41:15.562 --> 41:17.197
Does it ever end?

41:17.231 --> 41:19.632
Never.

41:19.666 --> 41:21.967
[chuckling] Never,
not from the day they're born.

41:22.035 --> 41:23.703
âª you're still on my mind somehow âª

41:23.737 --> 41:26.071
This is the safest your child will ever be.

41:26.106 --> 41:27.740
[chuckles]

41:27.775 --> 41:29.609
âª there's no way to go back now âª

41:29.676 --> 41:31.744
Don't let tonight fool you,

41:31.812 --> 41:34.947
- really, because most of the time...
- âª couldn't get back even if we wanted to âª

41:34.981 --> 41:37.182
It's the best thing ever.

41:37.217 --> 41:39.351
âª couldn't get back even âª
âª if we wanted to âª

41:39.386 --> 41:41.253
You're gonna be a great mom.

41:41.288 --> 41:43.622
âª oh, oh, oh, oh âª

41:43.656 --> 41:45.958
- [sighs]
- âª you were trying to make it work âª

41:45.992 --> 41:48.560
- And about that thing you asked earlier...
- âª you were sleeping in my shirt âª

41:48.594 --> 41:50.796
âª arcadia âª

41:50.830 --> 41:54.098
I would be honored
to be your baby's godmother.

41:54.133 --> 41:56.735
âª sometimes things âª
âª don't come full circle âª

41:56.769 --> 42:00.739
âª oh, oh, oh, oh âª

42:00.773 --> 42:02.841
âª I was hoping that you'd care âª

42:02.875 --> 42:04.976
âª I was distant, I was scared âª

42:05.010 --> 42:06.210
âª arcadia âª

42:06.245 --> 42:08.647
âª oh, oh, oh, oh âª

42:08.681 --> 42:09.881
Hey.

42:09.916 --> 42:12.116
I heard about, uh, Dana's daughter.

42:12.151 --> 42:13.717
Yeah [sighs] crazy night.

42:13.752 --> 42:15.820
Yeah, crazy-crazy kid.

42:15.854 --> 42:17.788
I'm pregnant, Charlie.

42:20.592 --> 42:24.062
I'm sorry. I-I couldn't
figure out how else to tell you.

42:24.096 --> 42:26.431
[siren wails]
âª sometimes things don't come full circle âª

42:26.465 --> 42:28.031
Well, hey...

42:28.066 --> 42:30.568
More Alex Reid... that can't
be a bad thing, right?

42:30.602 --> 42:31.802
[chuckles]

42:31.837 --> 42:33.337
âª oh, oh, oh âª

42:33.371 --> 42:35.238
âª I was hoping that you'd care âª

42:35.273 --> 42:37.608
âª I was distant, I was scared âª

42:37.642 --> 42:40.511
Charlie, we're gonna need you.

42:40.545 --> 42:41.579
Got to go.

42:41.613 --> 42:43.447
âª you were trying to make it work âª

42:43.481 --> 42:45.548
âª you were sleeping in my shirt âª

âª sometimes things âª
âª don't come full circle âª

42:52.122 --> 42:53.255
Joel.

42:53.323 --> 42:54.556
Uh, can you call me back?

42:54.591 --> 42:57.626
There's something that I need to tell you.

42:57.694 --> 42:58.927
Okay, bye. [sighs]
