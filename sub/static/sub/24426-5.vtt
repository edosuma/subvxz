She took my phone.

32:33.641 --> 32:35.505
It has the interview
with Frank on it.

32:35.539 --> 32:37.679
And she'’ll have the location
of the safe house.

32:37.714 --> 32:40.165
I used my phone to get us there.All right.

32:41.235 --> 32:42.684
I'’m going to alert
armed response...

32:42.719 --> 32:44.445
I need forensics at my house,

32:44.479 --> 32:46.343
I need protection
for my husband,

32:46.378 --> 32:49.070
but most importantly,
we need to move Frank now.

32:49.105 --> 32:51.279
Yes, all right, um...[cell phone keys beeping]

32:51.314 --> 32:52.522
Do you want to, um...

32:52.556 --> 32:54.075
[Kenny] Well, I'’ve got
the pudding to do, so...

32:54.110 --> 32:55.456
[Carolyn] Yes, pudding, yes,
uh, yeah, sure.

32:55.490 --> 32:56.802
Will you still save...Save you some? Sure.

32:56.836 --> 32:58.597
Yes. Thank you. Yes.
All right. Let'’s go.

32:58.631 --> 33:00.771
[sinister music playing]

33:00.806 --> 33:03.429
[thunder rumbling]

33:12.300 --> 33:15.131
Oh, God! Oh, God! Someone!

33:15.165 --> 33:16.684
[chuckles]

33:16.718 --> 33:18.341
Squealer.

33:18.375 --> 33:20.101
I'’m... No, I'm...

33:20.136 --> 33:22.276
I didn'’t tell them
everything. [panting]

33:24.105 --> 33:25.417
[breathing heavily]
Are you going to kill me?

33:25.451 --> 33:26.383
Mmm.

33:28.316 --> 33:31.354
But first, I'’m going to
use you for sex.

33:34.391 --> 33:35.565
[laughs]

33:38.809 --> 33:40.018
It'’s just a joke.

33:41.088 --> 33:42.710
Please. Please!

33:44.194 --> 33:45.437
We can do a deal.

33:46.645 --> 33:48.578
I have a lot of money.So do I.

33:49.820 --> 33:51.339
I have children.

33:51.374 --> 33:53.272
I don'’t want your children.

33:54.342 --> 33:57.621
No, I have children
to take care of.

33:57.897 --> 34:00.072
Oh! Oh.

34:00.107 --> 34:02.661
This will give them
something to bond over.

34:04.180 --> 34:05.905
[breathing heavily]You scared?

34:05.940 --> 34:07.459
Yes.

34:07.493 --> 34:10.358
Because you don'’t know
what happens when you die?

34:14.259 --> 34:15.777
You have any ideas?

34:20.886 --> 34:22.819
Your eyes will just...

34:24.510 --> 34:25.580
Empty.

34:27.513 --> 34:29.584
Then your soul goes in.

34:31.724 --> 34:35.452
People think that your soul
or personality, whatever,

34:35.487 --> 34:36.798
leaves the body
when you die.

34:36.833 --> 34:39.422
I swear, it just
goes further in.

34:41.389 --> 34:43.529
It falls so far in
and just...

34:45.566 --> 34:47.326
Just becomes so small

34:47.361 --> 34:49.708
that it can'’t control
your body anymore.

34:49.742 --> 34:52.849
It'’s just in there,
dying forever.

34:53.539 --> 34:54.782
[sobs]

34:55.748 --> 34:56.749
Mmm.

34:59.511 --> 35:01.375
[whimpering
and breathing heavily]

35:01.409 --> 35:02.548
[stutters]

35:03.411 --> 35:04.723
I'’m going to kill you nicely.

35:05.758 --> 35:08.658
Hmm? First.

35:08.692 --> 35:10.970
But then I'’m going to make
a mess of your body afterwards

35:11.005 --> 35:12.696
so it looks worse than it is.

35:12.731 --> 35:14.181
Just so you know, okay?

35:14.215 --> 35:16.252
[stammers] No, wait,
please, can we...

35:16.286 --> 35:17.805
Do it in the bedroom?

35:18.840 --> 35:21.153
I have a thing for
bathrooms, actually.

35:21.947 --> 35:23.224
Please?

35:24.501 --> 35:26.296
[breathes deeply]

35:26.331 --> 35:29.644
Okay. Come on.
Let'’s do it in there.

35:39.758 --> 35:40.966
[thunder rumbling]

35:42.243 --> 35:43.417
[sobbing]

35:46.282 --> 35:48.387
[whimpering]

35:55.463 --> 35:56.464
[grunts and yells]

35:58.604 --> 35:59.674
[gasps]

36:00.779 --> 36:02.712
Don'’t get me excited.I'’m sorry.

36:03.747 --> 36:05.197
Take off your clothes.

36:06.992 --> 36:09.650
[sighs] And you might
get away with this.

36:14.758 --> 36:17.313
What do you want from me?Your penis.

36:17.347 --> 36:18.555
My... Huh?

36:24.596 --> 36:26.356
[suspenseful music playing]

36:41.716 --> 36:43.649
[device beeps][officer] Complete?

36:43.684 --> 36:45.375
[man over radio]
First room'’s clear!

36:48.033 --> 36:50.484
[device beeps][man yelling incoherently]

36:58.008 --> 36:59.527
[man on radio]
We have one male in need of

36:59.562 --> 37:01.219
urgent medical assistance.

37:10.055 --> 37:12.230
[indistinct chatter]

37:12.920 --> 37:14.646
Oh, my God!

37:14.680 --> 37:16.786
Max, are you okay?

37:17.511 --> 37:19.927
Frank?[grunts]

37:24.000 --> 37:25.035
Oh...

37:26.658 --> 37:27.762
Oh!

37:32.457 --> 37:34.804
Through there?Yes, ma'’am.

38:09.183 --> 38:10.943
[car door shuts]

38:13.360 --> 38:14.844
She, um...

38:17.433 --> 38:18.434
She...

38:20.850 --> 38:22.092
Just say it.

38:22.127 --> 38:24.578
She chopped his knob off.

38:28.996 --> 38:30.066
Right.

38:34.484 --> 38:35.589
[gasping]

38:43.182 --> 38:45.737
[Villanelle]
Diego and Nadia were fighting.

38:45.771 --> 38:46.945
Ugh.And then?

38:46.979 --> 38:48.912
And then he just
went backwards!

38:48.947 --> 38:50.086
I was screaming.

38:50.120 --> 38:52.191
Nadia put something in
the back of the car and bang,

38:52.226 --> 38:54.435
he hit her.

38:54.470 --> 38:56.334
Told me to get out of the car
and we just walked away.

38:57.196 --> 38:59.406
I had no weapon.

38:59.440 --> 39:02.132
He said he was going to
kill me, I said, "Why?

39:02.167 --> 39:06.378
"Why? We'’re meant to be a team,
we have to get the target."

39:06.413 --> 39:09.105
Said we were, uh... Oh, God,
what'’s the word he used?

39:09.139 --> 39:10.624
"Pumpkins."

39:11.866 --> 39:15.042
So?So I shot him.

39:15.076 --> 39:18.459
Oh. I thought you had no weapon.

39:21.428 --> 39:22.981
I took his.Oh.

39:23.015 --> 39:26.191
While he was pointing it
at you?

39:26.225 --> 39:28.020
I didn'’t want to tell you
this part of the story

39:28.055 --> 39:29.712
because I knew
you would be jealous.

39:30.540 --> 39:31.645
Hmm?

39:33.854 --> 39:35.614
I had to use my tits.

39:37.478 --> 39:40.447
[laughs] To kill him?

39:40.481 --> 39:42.241
You killed him
with your tits?

39:42.276 --> 39:43.588
No!

39:43.622 --> 39:45.693
When he was looking at them,
I took his gun.

39:45.728 --> 39:47.385
Ah, okay.

39:49.870 --> 39:51.837
It was so sad, you know?Mmm-hmm.

39:51.872 --> 39:53.874
I liked having a team,

39:53.908 --> 39:55.600
but you can'’t
trust anyone, huh?

39:56.842 --> 39:58.050
You told me that.

39:59.776 --> 40:01.468
Nadia is still alive.

40:03.193 --> 40:04.885
No.

40:04.919 --> 40:07.025
No, he...
He went over her.

40:07.059 --> 40:08.440
Twice.

40:10.477 --> 40:12.099
I think you should go
and visit her

40:12.133 --> 40:15.136
before she starts telling
her side of the story.

40:15.171 --> 40:16.206
[chuckles nervously]

40:17.691 --> 40:18.968
Where is Nadia?

40:20.487 --> 40:21.488
Russia.

40:24.283 --> 40:25.319
You have no choice.

40:25.353 --> 40:28.149
No one else can do it.
It'’s too suspicious.

40:28.184 --> 40:29.634
Don'’t worry.

40:29.668 --> 40:31.532
You can come
straight back.

40:31.567 --> 40:33.707
What about Anna? Hmm?

40:34.708 --> 40:35.916
You won'’t see her.

40:41.128 --> 40:42.129
What?

40:45.788 --> 40:47.030
What number are you?

40:48.860 --> 40:50.102
What?

40:51.138 --> 40:52.588
You'’re not 12.

40:56.902 --> 40:58.904
[sighs] Oh, dear.

41:08.327 --> 41:10.468
[theme music playing]
