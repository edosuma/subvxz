In Lord of the Flies, a group of boys...

38:11.455 --> 38:13.707
...slaughter a pig in the jungle.

38:14.333 --> 38:17.043
They torture it and place its head
on a sharpened stake...

38:17.211 --> 38:21.464
...as an offering to the beast
that hovers God-like over the island.

39:06.177 --> 39:08.511
The black blood drips down
the pig's teeth...

39:08.679 --> 39:10.805
...and the boys run away.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.443
Later, when one of the boys is alone,
he weeps.

39:23.611 --> 39:25.779
But not for the pig.

39:26.947 --> 39:31.910
The boy weeps for the end of innocence
and the darkness of men's hearts.

Have you seen Derek?

No.

What were you two doing?

40:01.690 --> 40:04.192
Nothing. Uh, just went to get an ice cream.

-I'm not sure.

40:17.915 --> 40:20.625
But he came in after Dmitri

40:20.793 --> 40:23.294
Enough time for Sarkissian
to sell him The Turk.

but it's something.
