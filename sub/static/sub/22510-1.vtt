00:27.721 --> 00:30.961
Hoist anchor, Montgomery,
we're setting off today...

00:31.681 --> 00:33.161
for new shores

00:33.561 --> 00:35.641
beyond the horizon.

00:36.081 --> 00:38.401
We'll leave everything behind.

00:38.841 --> 00:42.121
All the misery, all the...

00:42.801 --> 00:44.441
Shit!

00:44.841 --> 00:46.081
Damn it!

00:46.681 --> 00:48.241
<i>Dirk Kowalski on set, please!</i>

00:48.601 --> 00:52.241
1000 MEXICANS

00:52.481 --> 00:54.881
<i>Quiet please, we're ready to shoot!</i>

00:57.641 --> 00:59.481
<i>Where are the sweeties?</i>

01:03.321 --> 01:05.361
You're on a diet!

01:07.881 --> 01:09.121
Hi, pal!

01:11.801 --> 01:14.561
I can't wear those, Jenny.
I attract women.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.921
<i>Has anyone seen Dirk?</i>

01:19.961 --> 01:21.001
Watch out!

01:21.721 --> 01:25.401
Out of my way or you'll get a chop!
The karate kind, not pork!

01:25.841 --> 01:28.601
You could do with a few bitch slaps!

01:28.841 --> 01:31.801
Show a bit more respect, Boris,
if you ever want to work for me.

01:32.041 --> 01:34.121
Dream on, Adamsky!

01:35.161 --> 01:37.641
Move the motorhome.
It's in our way.

01:37.881 --> 01:40.441
Aye, aye, Captain!
- Great, acid drops!

01:59.961 --> 02:02.441
Man!
What the hell's going on here?

02:03.001 --> 02:05.321
I can't get a moment's peace!

02:05.721 --> 02:08.321
All this stress here
will kill me one day!

02:08.881 --> 02:10.481
Dirk! Relax!

02:11.681 --> 02:13.601
I need your autograph.

02:13.841 --> 02:16.401
My buddy's a huge fan of yours.

02:18.281 --> 02:21.041
You see, Lukas,
for me they always come first:

02:21.281 --> 02:24.241
the little sheep
who diligently work here

02:24.601 --> 02:27.201
and occasionally squeeze out
a few droppings.

02:27.761 --> 02:31.361
Do you understand?
I'm not a wolf. I'm a kind of sheepdog.

02:31.601 --> 02:34.361
I protect the herd.
I keep them together.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.201
Thierry,
what are you talking about?

02:37.601 --> 02:40.681
I thought I'd start
with a snappy metaphor,

02:41.041 --> 02:42.961
but let's get down to brass tacks.

02:44.441 --> 02:46.281
When we're finished,

02:46.801 --> 02:50.361
I'm making you Senior
Creative Art Director.

02:50.841 --> 02:53.161
You'll be boss!
How about that?

02:59.561 --> 03:01.561
Wow! That's really...

03:03.201 --> 03:05.921
You're as useful
as a shit-flavored lollipop.

03:06.761 --> 03:11.161
Sorry, Wolfgang, the van was in my blind
spot... We'll come to that later.

03:11.521 --> 03:14.281
You can't just go
and ask Dirk Kowalski

03:14.641 --> 03:15.801
for his autograph.

03:16.121 --> 03:19.841
Stalkers with homemade fan buttons do that,
but not team members.

03:21.041 --> 03:23.361
We can't find Dirk
and we're ready to shoot.

03:24.361 --> 03:27.041
Then do the reverse shots first.

03:27.401 --> 03:30.721
And hire a five-star motorhome for Dirk.
That'll relax him.

03:31.081 --> 03:32.241
You got it!

03:32.481 --> 03:34.281
"You got it!"

03:34.521 --> 03:36.481
It's your fault, dickwad!

03:36.761 --> 03:38.601
Get your stuff and go!

03:43.401 --> 03:44.401
Know what?

03:44.721 --> 03:46.081
This was worth it.

03:46.321 --> 03:48.961
Your firm's as lousy
as your broken executive chair!

03:49.721 --> 03:51.601
Anyway, you can't fire me.
- Yeah?

03:52.041 --> 03:54.401
"Yeah?". I quit!

03:54.641 --> 03:57.321
Great!
I don't have to give you severance pay.

03:57.561 --> 03:59.841
Huh?
- I'll give you a nice reference.

04:00.241 --> 04:03.761
If you don't get the 8,000 euros
you owe me for the van

04:04.001 --> 04:06.761
and put it on my desk
by next week,

04:07.121 --> 04:11.561
I'll see to it that you never work
in the film industry again.

04:12.881 --> 04:14.201
8,000 euros?

04:15.801 --> 04:18.281
I didn't mean to...
- Get out!

04:29.201 --> 04:31.361
I'd like you to imagine this:

04:31.601 --> 04:34.241
you're sitting with your dream woman

04:35.361 --> 04:37.601
in a beautiful field of flowers.

04:38.281 --> 04:41.041
The last rays of sunlight
are turning the sky

04:42.321 --> 04:44.641
into bronze-colored honey.

04:45.481 --> 04:47.921
Bronze-colored honey?
- Yes.

04:48.601 --> 04:50.521
What's wrong with it?
- Sounds shit.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.881
Golden honey sounds better.

04:57.361 --> 04:59.081
I've been thinking.

04:59.321 --> 05:01.641
Let's start our own production firm,

05:02.001 --> 05:05.601
like we were going to.
"Mad Eagle" was just the beginning, dude!

05:05.841 --> 05:09.401
Not that again.
- Why the Jean Claude Van Damme not?

05:09.641 --> 05:13.161
The important thing is:
you deal with the creative shit and I...

05:13.641 --> 05:15.081
do everything else.

05:15.441 --> 05:17.641
Including the casting couch again.

05:18.121 --> 05:20.801
You didn't raise one cent,
Mr. Producer.

05:21.041 --> 05:24.481
I was on the verge of
securing a major deal!

05:25.921 --> 05:29.841
If you hadn't started at the agency,
we'd be raking it in now.

05:30.681 --> 05:32.601
Oh, they've fired you.

05:33.321 --> 05:35.521
That's why you're going on
about that again.

05:36.561 --> 05:39.121
Plus, you've bought alcohol-free beer.

05:47.801 --> 05:50.481
Then let's go
for a real afterwork drink.

05:50.721 --> 05:53.921
No way! I've got to be
fit for work tomorrow.

05:54.641 --> 05:56.321
I'm in shock from being fired.

05:56.561 --> 05:58.881
I bought alcohol-free beer.

06:03.401 --> 06:05.601
One shot, here at home!

06:11.521 --> 06:14.721
Grandpa, gimme another! Please!

06:15.201 --> 06:18.801
You and your pal should go home.
You've had enough.

06:19.161 --> 06:21.321
I decide when I've had enough.

06:21.681 --> 06:23.361
Yeah, but not here.

06:23.601 --> 06:26.641
My joint, my rules.
- But he's asleep, too.

06:28.641 --> 06:31.241
That's Rainer the Eel: furniture.
Scram!

06:32.921 --> 06:34.721
And if I don't?

06:35.841 --> 06:38.401
I'll teach you to fly without wings.

06:49.561 --> 06:52.961
Another tray of Mexicans, please.
- There's none left.

06:53.401 --> 06:55.521
But for you, I'll mix some more.

07:38.921 --> 07:40.801
A beer and a Mexican, Earl.

07:41.161 --> 07:42.801
Hey, you lovely ladies!

07:43.601 --> 07:46.201
Objection!
- Sustained! - Hi, Martin.

07:46.561 --> 07:48.681
Dude!
- Everything OK?

07:48.921 --> 07:52.281
You scared the hell out of me.
- So how's it going?

07:53.081 --> 07:54.561
Yeah...
- Yeah?

07:54.961 --> 07:56.321
It's going...

07:57.121 --> 07:58.761
down the pan.

07:59.401 --> 08:02.481
Mila's dreamed of this wedding
since she was about 12.

08:03.241 --> 08:06.241
It has to be perfect.
There's so much to remember.

08:07.001 --> 08:10.681
The right priest,
a de-escalation-oriented seating plan.

08:11.721 --> 08:15.561
One of Mila's aunts only eats stuff
that falls from trees.

08:16.161 --> 08:19.801
Does that mean I have to throw
the suckling pig from a tree?

08:21.961 --> 08:23.281
I can do the discofox.

08:23.961 --> 08:26.481
It's one of seven dances
I have to learn by Sunday.

08:26.721 --> 08:28.441
Shit, you're totally fucked.

08:29.561 --> 08:32.361
I love Mila.
You know that, don't you?

08:33.520 --> 08:34.881
Sure. Why?

08:35.961 --> 08:38.280
I've screwed up.
- What did you do?

08:38.841 --> 08:42.361
The movie team backed out.
It was the only thing I had to organize.

08:43.081 --> 08:46.961
We wanted to have the whole wedding
filmed by professionals.

08:49.041 --> 08:52.161
How about another drink for you ladies?

08:53.481 --> 08:56.761
You guys made that "Mad Eagle" film.
- Yeah.

08:57.481 --> 08:59.281
Couldn't you film our wedding?

08:59.641 --> 09:01.641
You're wedding filmmakers?

09:02.001 --> 09:04.161
How romantic is that?

09:04.561 --> 09:06.441
Yeah, that's right.

09:06.961 --> 09:09.121
I was just about to tell you.

09:09.361 --> 09:11.721
Wedding film makers are in demand.

09:12.481 --> 09:17.121
Right. It's peak season,
all the teams are booked. I'd pay you.

09:23.881 --> 09:24.881
We'll do it.

09:25.201 --> 09:27.201
We can't let a friend down.

09:27.441 --> 09:28.881
Can we, Lukas?

09:29.241 --> 09:31.241
We'll do it:
the whole enchilada.

09:31.721 --> 09:33.721
From wedding vows
to wedding night.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.361
The wedding night?

09:36.601 --> 09:39.001
You mean it?
You really mean it?

09:39.641 --> 09:41.121
I won't forget this!

09:41.481 --> 09:44.041
Another round of Mexicans, ladies?

09:47.441 --> 09:49.481
Wow, awesome!
1,000 Mexicans!

09:51.121 --> 09:53.321
Mexicans all round!

10:02.321 --> 10:05.441
Another tray!
That was just the beginning!

10:47.921 --> 10:48.921
Secure.

10:56.521 --> 10:58.761
Fuck me sideways! Fromsbert.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.921
That was a long time ago, Adam.
My name's Rocko now.

11:04.281 --> 11:06.881
Yeah, right.
Fromsbert, Martin's brother.

11:07.281 --> 11:08.881
What happened to you?

11:09.121 --> 11:11.881
He was such a skinny little shit!

11:12.241 --> 11:15.801
I work as a government bodyguard
in high-risk areas:

11:16.041 --> 11:18.361
Afghanistan, Libya, Iraq.

11:20.601 --> 11:22.721
That's a souvenir from Yemen.

11:23.641 --> 11:28.041
Today at 03:00 Bravo time you made a
promise to my brother Martin. Sit.

11:29.601 --> 11:30.641
Sit.

11:34.801 --> 11:37.961
The top brass
have asked me to be best man.

11:38.401 --> 11:42.561
So I'm responsible for the accompanying
areas of responsibility. One of which...

11:43.761 --> 11:45.641
is the wedding movie.

11:46.161 --> 11:48.241
It was just a ploy.
- Really?

11:48.801 --> 11:51.241
What did you think?
- I meant it, Rocky.

11:51.601 --> 11:54.481
You shook on it,
so I'd say it's legally binding.

11:54.721 --> 12:00.321
And as Martin's been getting you two out of
legal scrapes for years, you owe it to him.

12:00.961 --> 12:04.521
Martin's relying on you
and he's posted it already.

12:05.401 --> 12:09.641
In my profession,
we call this the "point of no return."

12:14.401 --> 12:15.961
I've got to go to work.

12:20.241 --> 12:24.881
I worked for three days on what I'm about
to show you. You'd better stay and watch.

12:28.841 --> 12:32.521
Briefing: Martin is getting married
on Sunday at 10:00 Bravo time.

12:33.121 --> 12:36.761
To get everyone in the right mood,
your film will be shown beforehand.

12:37.001 --> 12:42.201
You'll find all the relevant info, such as
timing and coordinates, in this handout.

12:46.601 --> 12:49.361
Wow, our first commissioned film, Lukas.

12:50.081 --> 12:52.361
By the way:
cool presentation, Rocky.

12:52.601 --> 12:54.281
Thanks. Fridge?

12:58.201 --> 13:03.201
If this operation fails, I'll be wearing
the brown helmet, so it's not an option.

13:04.401 --> 13:06.041
Low-fat.

13:06.401 --> 13:07.761
Perfect.

13:08.761 --> 13:10.601
The whole works, huh?

13:11.121 --> 13:12.201
Well...

13:12.441 --> 13:13.721
Have fun.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.401
I'd like you to imagine this:

13:31.881 --> 13:35.361
you're sitting with a woman
in a lovely field of flowers.

13:37.201 --> 13:39.961
You look deep into each other's eyes.

13:41.361 --> 13:45.321
The last suns contaminate the sky
with bronze-colored...

13:45.681 --> 13:47.041
With golden honey.

13:50.241 --> 13:53.201
Busy as ever.
Very authentic. I like!

13:53.841 --> 13:55.521
Can I steal you for a sec?

13:55.881 --> 13:58.201
We're right in the middle.
- No problem.

13:58.561 --> 14:01.201
Maurice is totally in the picture.

14:01.441 --> 14:03.001
Come on.

14:06.361 --> 14:07.481
Hi.

14:09.321 --> 14:11.321
What was that all about?

14:13.481 --> 14:16.921
A truly excellent Cohiba, Thierry.
- You said it.

14:19.561 --> 14:23.001
We know each other from the sauna.
- It's a small world.

14:23.241 --> 14:24.641
By the way.

14:25.001 --> 14:26.961
Rocko has kindly drawn my attention

14:27.201 --> 14:30.041
to the immense emotional pressure
you're under.

14:30.401 --> 14:33.361
And I have to admit,
it hadn't escaped me.

14:34.321 --> 14:37.601
You're pale, you're shaking
and the dog doesn't like you.

14:38.281 --> 14:40.864
We think a short vacation
would do you good.

14:40.889 --> 14:43.585
After all, you'll soon
be a sheepdog, like me.

14:43.801 --> 14:47.321
I can't use an emotional wreck.
- But the Schätzing campaign was my idea.

14:48.241 --> 14:51.841
The layout for the photo shoot,
the website: all mine.

14:52.441 --> 14:56.161
Maurice will take over.
He's learned from the best: you.

14:57.241 --> 14:59.481
His name is Moritz.
He isn't Maurice.

15:00.401 --> 15:02.961
Am I off the campaign now?
- Listen.

15:03.401 --> 15:07.481
When one door closes,
another one opens somewhere else.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.681
Anyway, you're lucky
to have a friend like Rocko.

15:10.921 --> 15:13.361
They're few and far between.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.961
What a cute little fellow.
- Isn't he just?

15:22.201 --> 15:23.521
Shit!

15:35.921 --> 15:37.841
That's sweet of you.
Are they for me?

15:38.241 --> 15:41.721
Thanks to you and Rocko they laid me off.
Know what that means?

15:42.761 --> 15:45.121
That we can help
our frantic friend Martin.

15:47.241 --> 15:49.201
I can't do it without you, Lukas.

15:50.281 --> 15:51.681
I have something for you.

15:55.681 --> 15:57.401
Dirk Kowalski's autograph.

16:00.241 --> 16:01.521
That's it?

16:02.121 --> 16:05.201
You pester me for weeks
and now you're not pleased?

16:06.961 --> 16:09.321
What's he like in person?
- Totally cool.

16:10.361 --> 16:14.681
Where'd you get the wheels?
- The guy from the motorhome hire owed me.

16:15.281 --> 16:17.641
Come on,
I want to show you something.

16:23.721 --> 16:27.241
Air conditioning, hands-free speakerphone,
DVB-T tuner,

16:27.481 --> 16:30.601
kitchen, toilet, shower,
and a fully equipped

16:30.961 --> 16:33.321
editing studio... Shit!

16:34.161 --> 16:35.961
This is our new production van.

16:37.841 --> 16:41.081
That's your cell. I've connected it
to the speakerphone.

16:43.041 --> 16:48.081
<i>Oh, my head! Martin speaking.
I just wanted to say I can't come today.</i>

16:48.321 --> 16:50.921
<i>Hopefully I'll be fit again
for the wedding in four days.</i>

16:51.161 --> 16:54.561
<i>I don't want Mila to leave me
standing at the altar like her ex.</i>

16:54.801 --> 16:58.161
I'm counting on you <i>guys.</i>
- Relax, everything's under control.

16:58.561 --> 17:02.201
We're interviewing the parents in
30 minutes. Over and out. Right.

17:02.441 --> 17:05.721
OK, I'll drive.
- Fine. I'll do our homework.

17:10.080 --> 17:12.481
I've made us a really awesome mix tape.

17:56.921 --> 17:59.041
Welcome to wedding hell!

17:59.281 --> 18:02.041
And the devil wears Pr...
- Protection vests.

18:02.401 --> 18:04.321
Put these in the boathouse.

18:05.081 --> 18:07.481
Martin isn't coming:
he's sick in bed.

18:08.081 --> 18:12.521
He can't take his drink anymore. You
should let him off the leash more often.

18:12.881 --> 18:14.281
He's a free agent.

18:14.521 --> 18:17.321
At least on Mondays, that's girls' night.
- Lucky guy!

18:17.681 --> 18:20.521
Come on,
we'll do the interviews in the lounge.

18:20.881 --> 18:23.641
It's the only free space
here at Knackstedt Castle.

18:24.281 --> 18:27.041
Just one thing...
- Who do I hear there?

18:29.641 --> 18:31.881
For God's sake...

18:34.321 --> 18:38.481
Good to see that the ravages of time
are getting to you guys as well.

18:39.321 --> 18:41.481
We're trying to age gracefully,
like you.

18:42.161 --> 18:43.761
Heinz-Dieter Knackstedt!

18:44.361 --> 18:46.681
You're looking good!
What's the secret?

18:47.041 --> 18:51.481
Since I retired, I've found some new
hobbies: golf, fishing, personal Pilates.

18:52.961 --> 18:54.601
And a few old ones.

18:57.081 --> 19:01.201
But not a word to Ingeborg.
OK, let's get down to business.

19:03.081 --> 19:04.641
Creation, production...

19:05.041 --> 19:07.921
You get the other half when
the movie's finished. OK.

19:10.281 --> 19:12.321
OK, time for a sherry.

19:13.721 --> 19:16.681
The film team is the best in the region.

19:17.321 --> 19:18.601
Here they are!

19:20.001 --> 19:21.681
Come in, guys.

19:23.041 --> 19:24.041
Hi, Lukas.

19:24.481 --> 19:27.401
Hi there, y'all!
We're the team from...

19:27.641 --> 19:29.841
French Fried Fur Films Ltd. Inc.,

19:30.241 --> 19:34.201
your cinematic service
from wedding vows to wedding night.

19:34.441 --> 19:37.961
My esteemed colleague Lukas
is a master cinematographer.

19:38.681 --> 19:41.561
And I'm Adam, the go-to guy
if good's not enough

19:41.921 --> 19:44.961
and you want excellent...
- Tone it down.

19:45.321 --> 19:49.281
Lukas. Bückstedt, pleased to meet you.
My wife Dietlinde.

19:49.921 --> 19:51.921
Bückstedt and Knackstedt,

19:52.721 --> 19:54.761
the perfect match, huh?

19:58.081 --> 19:59.881
Are you famous?

20:00.401 --> 20:03.081
I could swear I've seen you before.

20:04.481 --> 20:07.601
I've run the Wild Mouse rollercoaster
in Hamburg for 35 years.

20:08.481 --> 20:11.601
And I'm eight-time champion
on the high striker.

20:12.041 --> 20:13.641
The rollercoaster man!

20:13.881 --> 20:14.881
Please!

20:15.081 --> 20:18.281
Do it just once.
I'm a great admirer of your art.

20:18.721 --> 20:21.081
Dad...
- Please! Just once!

20:24.081 --> 20:25.961
Step right up, folks!

20:26.321 --> 20:29.601
Climb aboard for a ride
that'll knock your socks off!

20:29.841 --> 20:31.641
Here we go now!

20:33.681 --> 20:36.321
Thaaaaaat's right!

20:36.561 --> 20:40.521
Can you take any more, folks?
The worst is yet to come!

20:44.081 --> 20:47.561
If you want to win, win, win,
go next door, you wimps!

20:47.801 --> 20:51.841
This here is the Wiiiiiiiiiild Mouse!

20:52.201 --> 20:55.241
Step right up, folks!
Don't be shy now!

20:55.601 --> 20:59.481
Scratch your balls, stroke your pussies,
buy a ticket, don't be wussies!

20:59.841 --> 21:03.961
Huge tits, wet piss flaps,
you'll end up puking on your laps!

21:12.241 --> 21:15.561
Ingeborg, stop making such a fuss!

21:17.401 --> 21:18.961
Unbelievable!

21:19.961 --> 21:23.201
Oh, Ingeborg!
- And you can cut that out!

21:25.481 --> 21:28.641
We're ready.
- I can't do it, Lukas!

21:29.561 --> 21:33.601
The fact that those carnies are marrying
into our family is driving me crazy.

21:33.961 --> 21:38.161
I wish I could say something brilliant,
but I don't know them any better than you.

21:38.961 --> 21:42.281
But I know Mila,
and I know that Martin loves her.

21:42.841 --> 21:45.201
His other girlfriends
were a weird bunch.

21:45.721 --> 21:49.441
Mary, Peggy, Nicki and Beate.

21:49.801 --> 21:51.441
Mary was the cop with great...

21:51.921 --> 21:55.321
With... Did breathalyzer
tests in a sexy cop uniform.

21:55.561 --> 21:57.681
You didn't like any of them.
Rightly so.

21:58.481 --> 22:01.801
Peggy thought sparrows were baby pigeons.

22:02.121 --> 22:06.321
And Nicki almost starved to death
trying to count the steps on an escalator.

22:07.161 --> 22:08.801
Nicki was a gas!

22:11.281 --> 22:12.641
Mila's different.

22:13.201 --> 22:17.041
And if someone manages to raise
such a sweet, loveable person,

22:17.281 --> 22:19.761
then they can't be so bad.

22:20.641 --> 22:22.401
Go on, give her a chance.

22:26.161 --> 22:29.121
And that's for not being born
30 years sooner.

22:35.481 --> 22:36.681
Women...

22:49.281 --> 22:51.041
And action!

22:52.001 --> 22:53.441
Heinz-Dieter...

22:53.721 --> 22:56.721
What do you think
about your new family member?

22:57.121 --> 23:00.161
Well, I always wanted a daughter,

23:00.521 --> 23:03.161
and Mila is terrific.

23:04.001 --> 23:07.521
Our Martin is such a sweet-natured person.
Believe me.

23:07.961 --> 23:12.641
Safety: we don't always spell it right,
but it's a big priority for us.

23:14.921 --> 23:18.681
Mila and her Bertram always put it first.
- Bertram?

23:19.281 --> 23:21.481
Yes, Bertram.
Good old Bertram.

23:25.401 --> 23:27.641
Quantity isn't as important as...

23:28.001 --> 23:30.601
the framework.
Just like on a rollercoaster.

23:31.401 --> 23:35.161
If the nuts and bolts are secure,
the structure will stand for a lifetime.

23:35.401 --> 23:39.641
It doesn't matter
if you have a drooping plank now and then.

23:47.721 --> 23:49.401
Dietlinde?

23:50.361 --> 23:52.561
Go ahead.
- She's mute.

23:53.161 --> 23:54.801
That's all we need.

23:56.921 --> 23:59.161
Then we don't need any sound.

24:02.481 --> 24:06.121
I've got to go to my dance class.
If there's a problem, call me.

24:06.361 --> 24:07.521
Sure.

24:09.041 --> 24:10.801
Now for the final question.

24:12.801 --> 24:14.121
Mr. Bückstedt...

24:14.361 --> 24:16.681
Or may I call you Willi?
- Sure.

24:17.401 --> 24:20.601
Was that the question?
- No. Willi...

24:21.401 --> 24:24.001
What advice would you give
to your daughter,

24:24.241 --> 24:26.601
the future Mila Knackstedt?

24:27.641 --> 24:30.681
You mean the future Mila Bückstedt.

24:32.281 --> 24:34.761
They intend to bear
the proud name of Bückstedt.

24:35.361 --> 24:36.601
I'm sorry?

24:36.841 --> 24:38.961
What?
You didn't know?

24:39.441 --> 24:41.721
It must be a misunderstanding.

24:41.961 --> 24:45.601
My son would never agree to being
called Bückeburg. Bückstedt.

24:45.961 --> 24:49.481
The name would die out otherwise.
Mila is our only child.

24:50.441 --> 24:51.681
That's the limit!

24:52.041 --> 24:55.041
Martin would never
take the name of gypsies.

24:55.281 --> 24:58.321
Bückstedt: the very sound of it!
- Bückstedt.

24:59.121 --> 25:02.441
Let's all calm down.
Would anyone like a...

25:03.441 --> 25:05.321
sherry?
- That's enough.

25:05.961 --> 25:08.521
I've never had this
in 35 years at the carnival.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.321
We have a name
for people like you.

25:11.921 --> 25:13.201
Carnival cunt.

25:13.841 --> 25:14.841
What?

25:15.601 --> 25:17.841
What did you say to my wife?

25:18.201 --> 25:19.561
Carnival cunt!

25:20.241 --> 25:22.401
They're women who...
- I know what it means.

25:22.761 --> 25:25.161
Take that back
or I'll get violent.

25:26.321 --> 25:27.521
You'?

25:27.761 --> 25:31.361
You wouldn't reach the limp-dick mark
on the high striker!

25:37.961 --> 25:39.841
Shit! The camera!

25:43.641 --> 25:46.001
Give me covering fire!
- What?

25:47.281 --> 25:48.721
What with?

26:01.121 --> 26:02.281
Shit...

26:02.521 --> 26:04.721
8,000 EUROS!!!
YOU SHIT STICK!

26:07.281 --> 26:10.561
Did you know there were edible menu cards?

26:11.921 --> 26:14.601
I was hit on the head with a
fire extinguisher today. Yeah.

26:14.961 --> 26:18.841
And I didn't abandon you. It's your
fault I'm making this stupid film.

26:19.081 --> 26:22.041
While "Maurice" saws away
at my chair at the agency.

26:26.441 --> 26:29.441
Relax, Lukas. It's turned out great.

26:35.801 --> 26:38.241
Enjoying your beer?
- Where did you come from?

26:38.641 --> 26:41.201
Where I come from
you'd be hung upside down...

26:41.561 --> 26:44.961
Where I come from, dunderhead,
you order a drink first

26:45.201 --> 26:47.481
and don't take up other people's space.

26:53.601 --> 26:54.841
Water.

26:55.681 --> 26:56.841
Without gas.

26:57.961 --> 26:59.281
Easy-peas)'-

27:07.681 --> 27:10.121
Ingeborg needed eight stitches
in her eyebrow.

27:10.641 --> 27:12.681
And Willi's got a sherry glass
in his thigh.

27:12.921 --> 27:17.321
You should've known that your morn
doesn't like Martin's new in-laws.

27:17.681 --> 27:20.921
Rocky, without Lukas
we wouldn't even have an interview.

27:21.281 --> 27:23.201
So I should be grateful, huh?

27:23.441 --> 27:25.721
You wussies should've mediated.

27:25.961 --> 27:29.121
It took me half the afternoon
to get things halfway under control.

27:29.361 --> 27:32.241
Afghanistan in 2013
was a cinch in comparison.

27:32.681 --> 27:34.441
Get your act together.

27:34.681 --> 27:36.921
Or else we'll have a Code Red.

27:37.441 --> 27:38.841
Exit?

27:42.441 --> 27:43.441
Shit!

27:44.201 --> 27:47.801
Well pick the dingle berries
from my ass! He didn't pay!

27:48.641 --> 27:50.001
It's OK, Earl.

27:50.801 --> 27:53.321
Put it on our tab.
- All right.

28:01.641 --> 28:03.121
Hey, you.
- Yeah?

28:06.801 --> 28:08.881
I can see your dick.
- What?

28:10.401 --> 28:12.961
And two beers for the gals, please.

28:13.601 --> 28:16.281
What was that?
Earl, a tray of Mexicans.

28:16.881 --> 28:19.961
And don't let me down, dude.
We're partners now.

28:24.561 --> 28:27.441
Hey, you lovely ladies.
Ever had a Mexican?

28:52.281 --> 28:53.481
Stop <i>m.</i>

28:54.161 --> 28:55.801
Cut it out!

28:59.801 --> 29:01.841
What was the address again?

29:02.361 --> 29:04.841
No idea. Where's your handout?

29:13.481 --> 29:17.681
"One day in the life of the bride.
Meeting point: Seaview Restaurant."

29:19.921 --> 29:21.641
"We also ask Adam

29:22.201 --> 29:25.721
to look after
the many sexually frustrated bridesmaids,

29:27.401 --> 29:30.601
who need a producer."
- No chance, like yesterday.

29:31.721 --> 29:34.041
What? You've no idea.

29:34.281 --> 29:36.281
"No chance," he says.

29:39.161 --> 29:42.321
You mean "no chance" like this, dude?

29:44.601 --> 29:47.281
Dude! What happened?

29:47.721 --> 29:51.401
To be honest, I've no idea.
Those fucking Mexicans!

29:51.641 --> 29:53.961
So hold your fire today.
- Or else?

29:54.521 --> 29:56.761
I'll publically distance myself from you.

29:57.121 --> 29:59.201
That means more for Daddy!

30:11.641 --> 30:13.361
Adam?
- Eileen.

30:16.361 --> 30:18.081
You know each other?

30:18.761 --> 30:21.001
Those are the guys with the Mexicans.

30:27.081 --> 30:29.441
So you really do film weddings.

30:44.321 --> 30:46.561
You two haven't changed a bit.

30:47.881 --> 30:51.201
All you care about
is who can lay the most women.

30:51.441 --> 30:54.001
I don't know
why Martin still hangs out with you.

30:54.241 --> 30:59.041
We're sorry. We didn't know the girls
were your bridesmaids. Honestly.

30:59.401 --> 31:01.321
Today was important to me.

31:01.561 --> 31:04.601
Now two of my bridesmaids
can't sit upright because of you.

31:04.841 --> 31:08.801
The third one had to sleep next to
the john. I think she means Kathrin.

31:09.041 --> 31:13.561
Getting the fitting for the wedding dress
and the stylist on one day was so hard.

31:14.161 --> 31:17.481
The Wedding's in three days
and I don't even have the right shoes.

31:18.001 --> 31:20.361
Swell, what you've gone and done.

31:22.921 --> 31:24.441
That's all we need.

31:27.161 --> 31:28.881
They look wonderful.

31:29.601 --> 31:33.841
What? A fishtail dress
is the worst thing for a bride's figure.

31:34.681 --> 31:36.281
Her stylist must be blind.

31:36.641 --> 31:40.641
An empire waist dress,
an asymmetrical low-cut neckline

31:41.001 --> 31:44.041
and a mint green veil.
That's how I would've done it.

31:46.521 --> 31:48.561
What?
It's totally obvious.

32:47.401 --> 32:49.441
That one looks good.

32:50.681 --> 32:52.521
That's enough.

32:53.041 --> 32:54.841
Do you have ginger beer?

32:55.361 --> 32:56.521
Preferably...

32:58.601 --> 33:01.401
OK, that'll do as well.
And now a little ice,

33:01.761 --> 33:05.761
some lime juice, a mint leaf
and a fresh slice of cucumber.

33:15.721 --> 33:17.521
We're out of limes.

33:18.041 --> 33:20.321
The first Moscow Mule
to be mixed at Earl's.

33:20.681 --> 33:22.601
And the last.
- Cheers.

33:23.081 --> 33:24.881
Thanks for the tip
about the mid-heels.

33:25.241 --> 33:28.481
In pumps you'd never have got through
the first dance.

33:29.121 --> 33:31.921
Here's to a great style advisor!
You should change jobs.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.201
And abandon Lukas?
No way.

33:36.761 --> 33:39.161
What a relief! Cheers!

33:39.881 --> 33:41.601
What are you drinking?
- Moscow Mule.

33:43.081 --> 33:44.761
Partners?

33:49.281 --> 33:50.401
It's delicious.

33:51.481 --> 33:55.441
Thanks for subbing for the girls.
- Yeah, but don't spread it around.

33:55.681 --> 33:57.921
It could ruin our reputation.

33:58.521 --> 34:03.081
How many are coming to our premiere?
- 150. But Martin's grandpa won't be there.

34:03.441 --> 34:05.441
What?
No Grandpa Knackstedt?

34:05.801 --> 34:08.841
He's grounded for rioting
in the old folks' home again.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.041
Martin's really sad about it.

34:15.161 --> 34:16.161
We're sorry.

34:17.001 --> 34:19.801
But you're hair looks sensational,
honestly.

34:22.001 --> 34:23.841
Handsome man?
- Lovely lady?

34:24.481 --> 34:29.121
Why don't you come with us
and we can carry on where we left off.

34:29.481 --> 34:32.281
I'd love to,
but I've stuff to do at the office.

34:32.521 --> 34:35.761
I'm the producer
and I have to take care of everything.

34:37.960 --> 34:41.041
OK, sweetheart.
Maybe next time, huh?

34:47.761 --> 34:49.761
Next time definitely.

34:54.241 --> 34:56.241
What's wrong with you, sweetheart?

34:56.521 --> 34:59.001
That was a complimentary ticket.

34:59.921 --> 35:03.641
Cut it out!
- I never thought I'd see the day.

35:07.321 --> 35:09.161
<i>Lukas! Lukas, look!</i>

35:09.881 --> 35:12.161
<i>We could use
an electric callus remover, huh?</i>

35:14.641 --> 35:16.721
It's complete and utter junk.

35:17.761 --> 35:19.561
What were you thinking?

35:20.041 --> 35:23.801
On the handout it says:
"Day with bridesmaids." Where are they?

35:24.041 --> 35:25.921
If you screw up,
I'll get the blame

35:26.161 --> 35:29.161
and I can't disappoint Morn and Dad again!

35:30.761 --> 35:33.041
The bridesmaids were sick.

35:33.281 --> 35:37.361
We sacrificed ourselves for Mila.
My colleague found the right shoes for her.

35:40.481 --> 35:42.521
Fine.
I'll come with you tomorrow.

35:42.761 --> 35:46.801
We're re-enacting the marriage proposal
and nothing must go wrong.

35:47.441 --> 35:49.641
This film has top priority.

35:50.201 --> 35:54.521
Departure time: tomorrow,
06:00 Zulu... Alpha... Bravo...

35:55.921 --> 35:58.281
Tomorrow at six.
Time for dinner now...

35:59.921 --> 36:01.481
<i>$was m.</i>

36:16.481 --> 36:18.321
Are you all right?

36:18.601 --> 36:21.601
You called me your "colleague."
- What?

36:22.441 --> 36:25.481
"My colleague found the
right shoes for Mila."

36:25.721 --> 36:28.401
We're a good team, you must admit.

36:29.681 --> 36:31.281
That's blatantly obvious.

36:44.081 --> 36:46.721
So how was the spag bol?

36:49.721 --> 36:51.241
Salty.

36:51.481 --> 36:54.721
Did Martin tell you what happened
when he actually proposed?

36:54.961 --> 36:58.041
No. He was kind of embarrassed about it.

36:59.481 --> 37:03.721
He got down on one knee to Mila
and broke his kneecap.

37:05.401 --> 37:08.681
So what's the plan, guys?
- We... - I have it!

37:08.921 --> 37:11.441
Mila, investigative journalist,

37:11.681 --> 37:15.521
falls into the hands of rebels abroad
and is tortured and fuck...

37:15.761 --> 37:18.681
Martin,
elite special forces soldier,

37:19.401 --> 37:21.601
knows that negotiating is useless.

37:21.961 --> 37:26.521
He and his men attack the rebel camp
and he rescues Mila from a blazing house.

37:28.161 --> 37:32.281
In an Airwolf, they fly under the radar
into the sunset.

37:32.761 --> 37:36.561
Aboard the world's most lethal helicopter,
he proposes to her.

37:37.161 --> 37:40.001
That's totally awesome.
- Yeah...

37:40.681 --> 37:42.201
It's pretty close.

37:47.361 --> 37:49.521
You cannot be serious.

37:57.681 --> 37:59.361
Guys, how cool is that?

38:00.041 --> 38:03.841
I thought I was supposed to rescue Mila
from a blazing house.

38:05.441 --> 38:07.041
This is terrific!

38:13.601 --> 38:16.321
Where were you yesterday?
We missed you.

38:16.561 --> 38:17.761
Smoothie?

38:19.561 --> 38:24.081
Pity. We could've used a judge
for our wet T-shirt contest.

38:32.681 --> 38:34.721
Know how she earned money
at college?

38:35.081 --> 38:38.281
Private pole dancing.
You'll get your fingers burned.

38:39.201 --> 38:40.841
That's an awesome cliché.

38:41.441 --> 38:43.481
I need a bit more smoothie.

38:48.401 --> 38:51.201
I'd say this is wild boar territory.

38:54.481 --> 38:56.801
We don't want any uninvited guests.

39:01.761 --> 39:03.041
Just a minute!

39:06.761 --> 39:09.321
Here comes our special guest.

39:10.681 --> 39:11.841
What is it?

39:12.441 --> 39:13.801
That, my friend...

39:15.481 --> 39:16.561
is Bertram.

39:20.321 --> 39:22.881
Bertram!
- That's Bertram?

39:23.441 --> 39:25.521
Hi!
- He looks kinda sick.

39:26.601 --> 39:28.521
Her old pal from the pony show.

39:28.881 --> 39:31.641
I thought Mila would like him
to be in the film.

39:32.961 --> 39:34.561
I just hope he likes me.

39:48.241 --> 39:51.161
Once again, everybody, scene one.

39:51.521 --> 39:55.361
Mila dismounts, Martin gives her his hand
in gentlemanly fashion,

39:55.721 --> 39:57.201
you gaze into each other's eyes.

39:57.561 --> 40:00.361
You're pretty... thingummy... in love.

40:00.721 --> 40:05.681
And Rocko, keep your distance,
otherwise you'll be in the picture.

40:06.281 --> 40:07.681
Bless you.
- Thank you.

40:08.401 --> 40:11.401
Any questions?
- What should I do, Adam?

40:12.921 --> 40:15.681
Watch the monitor
and make sure nothing goes wrong.

40:16.281 --> 40:17.681
OK?
- OK, boss.

40:19.321 --> 40:23.121
She said "boss." If she was at
my place, I'd butter her muffin.

40:23.361 --> 40:25.641
Let go of the button,
everyone can hear you.

40:27.401 --> 40:28.881
Shit!

40:32.041 --> 40:33.921
Places everyone,
the camera's rolling

40:34.401 --> 40:35.401
and...

40:35.721 --> 40:37.561
And action.
- Action!

40:57.761 --> 41:00.641
Help! Bertram! Stop!

41:05.401 --> 41:06.841
That's enough!

41:23.401 --> 41:24.641
Shit!

41:36.521 --> 41:38.001
Leave me alone, Martin.

41:49.921 --> 41:52.241
I don't know what to say, Lukas.

41:53.001 --> 41:56.641
First you start a family feud,
then you get the bridesmaids drunk,

41:57.041 --> 41:59.041
then you almost get Mila killed.

41:59.281 --> 42:01.401
Martin, I'm really sorry.

42:01.641 --> 42:04.241
Why did that dumb-ass
scream into the megaphone?

42:04.801 --> 42:06.561
You know what Adam's like.

42:07.041 --> 42:09.001
I wish I'd never gone to Earl's.

42:09.881 --> 42:11.201
Fucking Mexicans!

42:12.401 --> 42:15.401
Bring me the footage you've already shot
by tomorrow.

42:15.641 --> 42:18.601
You're not going to film
one more second of my wedding.

42:26.401 --> 42:29.921
It's the very first thing
we learned at the academy.

42:30.281 --> 42:33.721
Quiet loners are the greatest danger,
the perfect assassins.

42:34.601 --> 42:38.081
We're still talking about a pony,
aren't we?

42:38.481 --> 42:40.561
How could I miss it?

42:41.681 --> 42:44.481
Calm down.
This happens to me all the time.

42:45.841 --> 42:47.521
You can't compare us two.

42:47.881 --> 42:50.801
You're totally irresponsible
and depend on your friends.

42:51.041 --> 42:53.521
At least I have friends.

43:00.561 --> 43:02.681
I'll lose my post as best man.

43:03.601 --> 43:06.881
We'll finish the film whatever happens.
Trust us.

43:07.401 --> 43:09.641
The film will be totally awesome.

43:09.881 --> 43:13.401
I think awesome would be sufficient.
- Yeah, awesome!

43:17.041 --> 43:18.201
Fuck!

43:20.201 --> 43:22.601
It's Lukas's cell.
It must be them.

43:22.841 --> 43:25.761
Lukas?
- Great news, Lukas.

43:26.241 --> 43:30.321
Late news?
- Your vacation's over. Come straight here.

43:30.561 --> 43:32.961
<i>What?</i>
- Yes, we need you here.

43:33.321 --> 43:34.921
<i>And not as a sheep,</i>

43:35.281 --> 43:36.841
but as a sheepdog.

43:37.081 --> 43:40.361
I'm sitting here with Peter.
- <i>A</i> dog called Peter?

43:41.081 --> 43:45.081
We've decided to give the campaign
back to you. OK, nuff said.

43:45.561 --> 43:47.081
Great, I'll...
- Bertram!

43:55.481 --> 43:57.161
The terrier's taken the bait.

44:00.321 --> 44:02.121
Did you see its stupid mug?

44:03.321 --> 44:06.321
Totally suicidal beast:
danger level one!

44:07.961 --> 44:09.681
Let's get out of here.

44:28.201 --> 44:31.601
<i>It doesn't matter
if you have a drooping plank now and then.</i>

44:38.881 --> 44:42.321
Hi! Everything OK?
- No, everything's down the pan.

44:43.001 --> 44:45.961
Martin's fired us
and I don't blame him.

44:47.121 --> 44:50.041
Why did you have to
scream into the megaphone?

44:50.401 --> 44:53.081
Sure! Now it's my fault again...

44:53.721 --> 44:56.401
It's a miracle
the horse didn't have a heart attack.

44:56.761 --> 44:59.561
I thought Bertram was deaf,
he looked so old.

44:59.801 --> 45:02.121
It was your idea to include the pony.

45:02.721 --> 45:06.441
Terroristic loners are the biggest danger.
- What?

45:07.921 --> 45:10.001
I'm the only one here
who has any ideas.

45:10.921 --> 45:15.201
Without me Mila would have no wedding
outfit. Who got the bridesmaids drunk?

45:15.441 --> 45:18.281
You're a slob, Adam.
And that's why

45:18.521 --> 45:21.841
I don't want to make
this fucking movie with you.

45:22.361 --> 45:23.361
What?

45:24.201 --> 45:26.041
Give me the camera.

45:26.961 --> 45:27.961
No.

45:29.001 --> 45:30.001
Now!

45:30.561 --> 45:33.361
Dude, give me the camera.

45:37.081 --> 45:38.881
Get out of my room.

45:42.201 --> 45:45.161
Your room, huh?
- I knew you'd do this.

45:52.561 --> 45:53.721
Fuck!

46:03.441 --> 46:05.921
<i>Yeah'?
- Adam, where's my dough?</i>

46:06.161 --> 46:08.441
Wolfgang!
You'll get your money.

46:08.681 --> 46:11.201
<i>Bring me the 8,000 by Monday or...</i>

46:11.441 --> 46:15.561
I've got a surefire thing going...
- <i>I</i> don't care <i>what</i> you've got going!

46:15.921 --> 46:18.041
OK, Wolfgang.
Have a nice evening.

46:18.281 --> 46:21.081
Fuck <i>you, assho...</i>
<i>- What? What did you say?</i>

46:42.321 --> 46:44.641
DIRK KOWALSKI VANISHED!

47:50.441 --> 47:52.161
Where are we going?

48:16.681 --> 48:18.961
If Grandpa Knackstedt
can't come to the wedding,

48:19.201 --> 48:21.361
at least he can send
a message to his grandson.

48:22.521 --> 48:26.721
If the Wedding's still on.
- The old guy, exclusively for our film.

48:27.241 --> 48:29.121
Brilliant! Yeah!

48:29.721 --> 48:31.561
That's why you're the driver.

48:32.801 --> 48:35.641
Yep. Because you always have
such good ideas.

49:16.361 --> 49:18.161
You've got thirty minutes.

49:22.281 --> 49:23.441
Mr. Knackstedt?

49:26.761 --> 49:28.321
We're friends of Martin.

49:29.001 --> 49:31.881
We've heard
you can't come to the wedding.

49:38.841 --> 49:41.121
They're keeping me prisoner here!

49:42.001 --> 49:43.561
What for?

49:43.801 --> 49:47.441
You don't need to shout!
I'm not deaf!

49:49.401 --> 49:52.041
I played strip poker.

49:52.481 --> 49:55.041
With Hilda, in the day room.

49:55.761 --> 49:59.681
Horny Hilda, huh?
- Wow, you know what I'm talking about!

50:00.681 --> 50:04.281
The old gal's gone a bit soft in the head.

50:04.921 --> 50:09.161
And Bingo Herbert from Block C
accused me of cheating.

50:10.121 --> 50:12.961
He's just jealous, the randy old goat!

50:13.321 --> 50:15.721
But you did cheat, right?

50:16.281 --> 50:18.121
Not necessary.

50:18.921 --> 50:22.361
The old gal hasn't got a clue
how to play poker.

50:24.921 --> 50:27.201
What are you two doing here?

50:27.441 --> 50:30.161
We're making Martin's wedding movie.

50:32.121 --> 50:34.961
We thought you might say
a few nice words.

50:35.321 --> 50:37.681
Nice words are for funerals.

50:39.201 --> 50:42.481
Or for the whorehouse,
if the price is right.

50:45.081 --> 50:46.761
We're doing this for Martin.

50:47.521 --> 50:49.441
Your grandson, who loves you.

50:49.921 --> 50:51.721
He loves me?

50:52.081 --> 50:54.921
If he loved me,
he wouldn't let me rot here.

50:56.401 --> 50:58.001
It's true, isn't it?

51:00.161 --> 51:03.681
It was a dumb idea, Adam. Let's go...
- No, wait.

51:04.161 --> 51:05.601
We'd like to...

51:05.841 --> 51:09.281
make a deal with you, Friedhelm.
- A deal?

51:09.721 --> 51:11.561
Well, I never!

51:13.121 --> 51:14.721
A deal...

51:37.561 --> 51:42.681
My oh my! Is that disinfectant
or is someone wearing 4711'?

51:45.241 --> 51:47.641
This is Eileen, Isa and Kathrin.

51:48.361 --> 51:51.001
They're all trained nurses.

51:51.401 --> 51:53.241
I'll bet they are!

51:54.361 --> 51:56.241
They're the hottest act around.

51:56.481 --> 51:58.761
Their shows are legendary.
But first...

51:59.521 --> 52:01.401
A few nice words
for the happy couple.

52:01.801 --> 52:04.161
You've got to hand it
to the motherfucker.

52:04.521 --> 52:08.241
He knows how to strike a deal.

52:14.561 --> 52:16.241
Visiting hours are over.

52:21.641 --> 52:23.641
You can look, but don't touch.

52:42.441 --> 52:44.441
What a brilliant idea.

52:45.961 --> 52:49.201
I'd love to be him now.
- Would be great for the film.

52:50.801 --> 52:54.001
You might have the best ideas,
but I have the connections.

52:54.241 --> 52:56.041
That's teamwork, dude.

53:02.401 --> 53:04.761
I'm sorry about this morning,
it was...

53:05.241 --> 53:07.801
I was a dick
to drive off without you.

53:08.361 --> 53:11.961
After yesterday, I wouldn't have blamed you
if you'd run me down.

53:13.361 --> 53:15.881
You can sleep at my place
as long as you want.

53:16.121 --> 53:17.881
And about the megaphone...

53:18.241 --> 53:21.481
I was buzzing, man.
And I wanted to be loud and clear.

53:21.721 --> 53:23.681
You certainly were.

53:23.921 --> 53:26.561
I've got a better idea
for our production company.

53:26.801 --> 53:28.601
Adaluks Film.

53:30.121 --> 53:32.881
Great name.
- It just came to me.

53:33.841 --> 53:36.681
And I can get us
some cheap business cards.

53:43.761 --> 53:46.081
We should get going.

53:46.761 --> 53:47.921
Right.

54:08.841 --> 54:11.561
Can't we come up
with a better running gag?

54:14.881 --> 54:16.441
Do you hear that?

54:18.281 --> 54:21.481
It's probably just another polecat
caught in the fan belt.

54:21.721 --> 54:23.441
It'll go soft eventually.
- No.

54:25.201 --> 54:27.601
It's coming from above.
- From above?

54:41.241 --> 54:42.681
Now it's stopped.

54:49.241 --> 54:51.681
What the hell are you staring at?

54:52.921 --> 54:55.361
You can walk?
- Of course I can!

54:56.241 --> 55:00.281
The wheelchair was just a cover.
I've been knocking for 20 kilometers!

55:00.521 --> 55:02.081
Are you deaf?

55:03.081 --> 55:06.801
What are you doing here?
- And where are the girls?

55:18.041 --> 55:19.281
Eileen...

55:20.321 --> 55:22.561
My little hottie.

55:23.001 --> 55:27.401
I wish we'd met
under different circumstances.

55:28.281 --> 55:30.041
I'll strangle you!

55:36.761 --> 55:41.201
You can't imagine what I've been through!

55:41.601 --> 55:44.801
These two scoundrels
cold bloodedly kidnapped me!

55:46.641 --> 55:49.881
Shut it! We've strict instructions
not to believe a word you say.

55:50.281 --> 55:52.001
This is outrageous!

55:52.521 --> 55:53.801
Control?

55:54.801 --> 55:55.801
Control?

55:56.961 --> 55:59.801
<i>Oh, hello, Uwe.</i>
- <i>Marion.</i> - <i>Hi, there.</i>

56:00.281 --> 56:01.681
Uwe...

56:01.961 --> 56:05.001
Registered vehicle owner check, please.

56:05.241 --> 56:07.241
For HH-FU 79.

56:08.281 --> 56:10.241
<i>Just a sec, Uwe, dear.</i>

56:13.281 --> 56:15.561
There's something fishy going on.
- I agree.

56:16.761 --> 56:21.201
We call him Berni the Beak.
He can smell trouble a mile away.

56:23.401 --> 56:27.241
We think it's a dead pole...
- This <i>is</i> Marion. - Go ahead.

56:28.121 --> 56:31.321
The vehicle was reported
stolen two days ago.

56:32.081 --> 56:34.481
Huh?
I thought you'd borrowed it!

56:38.081 --> 56:40.921
Be careful, Berni!
- Calm down, Lukas!

56:41.161 --> 56:43.361
For fuck's sake, Adam!

56:44.681 --> 56:46.041
Berni!

56:51.841 --> 56:52.841
Shit!

56:53.121 --> 56:56.161
Isn't that Dirk Kowalski?

57:24.561 --> 57:26.921
I should've let you two rot in there.

57:29.081 --> 57:30.881
They've dropped the murder charge.

57:31.121 --> 57:35.681
Kowalski died of a heart attack caused
by stress. I'm about to do the same.

57:36.681 --> 57:38.721
Why did you kidnap my grandpa?

57:39.081 --> 57:42.201
We didn't kidnap him...
- In a stolen motorhome? Are you nuts?

57:42.681 --> 57:43.761
I...
- I What?

57:45.041 --> 57:47.121
They've seized the motorhome
as evidence.

57:47.921 --> 57:51.801
And the camera? Gone. All for
nothing because of you putzes.

57:52.201 --> 57:55.441
I don't know how I'm going to explain it
to Mila and my family.

57:56.121 --> 57:59.401
Stay away from our wedding.
You've done enough damage.

58:01.681 --> 58:03.281
I never want to see you again.

58:25.721 --> 58:30.801
We drove around for days in a stolen
motorhome with the dead Dirk Kowalski.

58:31.321 --> 58:35.081
It wasn't stolen, I borrowed it.
- Without telling anyone?

58:37.121 --> 58:38.721
I screwed up on set

58:38.961 --> 58:42.041
and now I owe the fucking producer
8,000 euros.

58:42.801 --> 58:46.721
I need the money from the wedding movie.
- Unbelievable.

58:47.081 --> 58:50.361
And you told me
it was to help our frantic friend Martin.

58:50.601 --> 58:52.161
I can forget my promotion now.

58:52.921 --> 58:56.601
Your boss called yesterday when
you were in the ambulance. What?

58:56.841 --> 59:01.041
Something about a sheepdog and a guy
called Peter... The Schätzing campaign?

59:01.801 --> 59:04.721
And you're telling me now?
- I forgot!

59:05.201 --> 59:08.001
The pony distracted me...
- It was important!

59:08.361 --> 59:12.561
Calm down! You didn't want the job anyway.
- Are you trying to fuck me over?

59:12.801 --> 59:14.201
You forgot on purpose.

59:14.761 --> 59:17.121
You didn't want to be left alone
with the movie.

59:17.481 --> 59:21.201
No, Lukas! I just forgot about it!
- Bullshit, Adam!

59:22.361 --> 59:24.561
Unlike you,
I'd never let you down!

59:25.041 --> 59:26.881
You've been at my place
for over two years!

59:27.401 --> 59:29.721
Because your ex was fed up
of such a...

59:30.081 --> 59:31.561
A what?

59:31.801 --> 59:35.401
A career-obsessed dick
with a huge great stick up his ass!

59:38.921 --> 59:41.121
I'll move out tomorrow.

59:41.801 --> 59:44.521
I wanted our production company
just as much as you.

59:44.761 --> 59:47.721
Till I noticed
what a lousy business partner you are.

59:47.961 --> 59:51.401
You never finish anything.
You're totally irresponsible.

59:52.521 --> 59:54.841
Everything you touch turns to shit.

59:56.321 --> 59:57.801
Grow up!

59:58.161 --> 01:00:00.721
Right.
Go fetch coffee for your Thierry!

01:00:00.961 --> 01:00:03.921
You're just a little coffee boy, Lukas!

01:00:09.641 --> 01:00:10.801
Shit!

01:00:11.241 --> 01:00:12.241
Fuck!

01:00:18.921 --> 01:00:20.561
Thierry!

01:00:21.641 --> 01:00:23.721
Lukas! My God.

01:00:24.161 --> 01:00:26.201
It's our black sheep.

01:00:26.561 --> 01:00:28.761
I thought you'd left the herd.

01:00:29.001 --> 01:00:30.761
What's that?
Is it vintage?

01:00:31.001 --> 01:00:33.241
It's a long story.

01:00:33.601 --> 01:00:35.801
What about the Schätzing campaign?
- Dead.

01:00:36.201 --> 01:00:38.681
What?
- For Maurice. Burnout.

01:00:40.361 --> 01:00:43.961
I'm here to rejoin the herd.

01:00:48.281 --> 01:00:49.921
Please, Thierry.

01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:53.481
I won't allow you to rejoin the herd.

01:00:55.281 --> 01:00:58.361
You're now a sheepdog.
- Huh? - That's right.

01:00:58.721 --> 01:01:01.761
You're Senior Creative Art Director.

01:01:02.521 --> 01:01:05.601
You're the boss.
You've worked for this for years.

01:01:06.361 --> 01:01:10.281
Shooting begins tomorrow, using your plan.
- Tomorrow? - Yes.

01:01:10.641 --> 01:01:13.441
And afterwards
we'll enjoy these two beauties.

01:01:14.001 --> 01:01:17.841
Conference call in 30 minutes.
Come on, gee up! Gee up!

01:01:22.921 --> 01:01:26.281
Casual, all-weather. We don't know
how long the campaign will run.

01:01:29.001 --> 01:01:31.761
Chinos and a T-shirt in petrol
to match his eyes.

01:01:33.281 --> 01:01:36.481
I said twice as much equipment.
We want the set to look good.

01:01:37.961 --> 01:01:39.841
You can't be serious.

01:01:40.081 --> 01:01:44.561
The picnic blanket can't be blue.
That's our competitor's Cl color!

01:02:05.001 --> 01:02:07.121
This time I've really screwed up.

01:02:07.761 --> 01:02:10.121
I'll let you in on a little secret.

01:02:10.361 --> 01:02:14.801
The night I took the photo,
we were nowhere near the 1,000th Mexican.

01:02:15.441 --> 01:02:16.441
I lied.

01:02:16.681 --> 01:02:21.921
Because my gut feeling said: "if those two
work together, it'll be a good thing."

01:02:22.161 --> 01:02:24.521
You were wrong.
- I fucking wasn't!

01:02:24.881 --> 01:02:27.361
Show Lukas that you can finish a job.

01:02:28.521 --> 01:02:31.281
Otherwise you'll end up
like Rainer the Eel.

01:02:31.521 --> 01:02:34.401
You'll end up part of the furniture
in a dive like this.

01:02:55.681 --> 01:02:56.681
Thanks.

01:03:00.161 --> 01:03:03.041
Now it'll either get better
or even more fucked up.

01:03:26.081 --> 01:03:28.801
Helge was talking baloney at lunch.

01:03:29.441 --> 01:03:32.961
Jeez, the gate's really stiff, Berni.

01:03:33.201 --> 01:03:35.321
It needs greasing.
- It's rusty.

01:03:35.801 --> 01:03:36.921
Let me try.

01:03:40.081 --> 01:03:42.441
It's all rusted up.
And the bolt's bust.

01:03:44.961 --> 01:03:47.001
The bolt's bust. That's better!

01:03:48.361 --> 01:03:50.641
Brilliant. Now we're stuck here.

01:03:57.081 --> 01:03:59.481
My brother-in-law
had a similar problem with his gate.

01:04:00.321 --> 01:04:02.601
But eventually it came unstuck on its own.

01:04:02.961 --> 01:04:04.681
How?
- Simple.

01:04:05.881 --> 01:04:09.481
He just shut it real hard
as often as he could.

01:04:11.161 --> 01:04:12.241
A bit harder.

01:04:23.041 --> 01:04:24.041
Hopeless.

01:04:30.081 --> 01:04:33.321
Uwe, the whole thing's bent out of shape.

01:04:34.201 --> 01:04:37.841
OK, I'll give it a try.
Just let me try once, OK?

01:04:38.401 --> 01:04:39.401
Careful.

01:04:48.881 --> 01:04:51.201
Hopeless.
We'll see to it tomorrow, OK?

01:04:51.881 --> 01:04:54.641
Listen, is it after midnight already?
- Yep.

01:04:55.161 --> 01:04:59.721
At Erna's Cafe there's ground pork rolls
from yesterday at half price.

01:04:59.961 --> 01:05:02.481
Who's coming?
- Count me in!

01:05:03.401 --> 01:05:05.721
Ground pork rolls!
- We've earned it.

01:05:05.961 --> 01:05:08.681
Uwe! Ground pork rolls at half price!

01:05:39.121 --> 01:05:40.281
Shit!

01:06:27.921 --> 01:06:28.921
Shit!

01:07:34.561 --> 01:07:36.481
Oh, fucking shit!

01:07:59.321 --> 01:08:01.241
Sorry I'm late.

01:08:02.361 --> 01:08:05.961
Great.
- You worked all night? - On a few changes.

01:08:06.321 --> 01:08:09.201
But now we've distilled
the essence of the best.

01:08:09.561 --> 01:08:11.481
Your campaign's going to be...

01:08:12.921 --> 01:08:14.441
great.
- Wonderful.

01:08:15.201 --> 01:08:19.121
You know what, Lukas?
I've decided to shoot the ad myself.

01:08:19.961 --> 01:08:23.121
Mr. Schätzing
is one of our most esteemed clients.

01:08:23.361 --> 01:08:26.001
Flattery will get you everywhere, Thierry.
- What?

01:08:26.361 --> 01:08:29.520
Go get yourself a coffee.
The guys are still setting up.

01:08:29.881 --> 01:08:35.361
For me a cappuccino and for Peter
an espresso with three sugars and no milk.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:37.441
You remembered.
- Of course.

01:08:37.801 --> 01:08:41.680
Come on, I'll show you everything.
We'll start in front...

01:08:42.081 --> 01:08:45.241
They found him in his motorhome:
heart attack.

01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:48.361
Here one minute, gone the next.

01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.720
Adam drove around
with the corpse for a week.

01:08:51.001 --> 01:08:53.841
Our Sweetie Boy? Bigmouth Adam'?

01:08:54.481 --> 01:08:58.401
Do you know why they fired him?
- Because he rammed the van.

01:08:58.761 --> 01:09:04.121
That was covered by the insurance.
No, the producer fired him

01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:08.281
just for getting Dirk Kowalski's autograph.
- I don't believe it. The asshole!

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.321
Are you talking about Adam?

01:09:10.680 --> 01:09:12.121
Black hair,

01:09:12.481 --> 01:09:15.081
big mouth,
hits on anything with a pulse?

01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:17.640
That's our Adam.
Do you know him?

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:20.881
Yeah, he got the autograph for me.

01:09:21.121 --> 01:09:24.761
Well, you can be sure
it's really worth something now.

01:09:30.401 --> 01:09:32.401
Bad luck, Coffee Boy.

01:09:47.281 --> 01:09:49.081
What? Lukas?

01:09:50.361 --> 01:09:52.121
What are you doing?

01:09:52.361 --> 01:09:55.241
Fetch your own coffee.
I've got something better to do.

01:09:55.761 --> 01:09:59.201
If you shoot off out of here,
you're fired!

01:10:00.281 --> 01:10:01.881
Good idea, Thierry.

01:10:42.201 --> 01:10:44.921
Morning, Lukas. You're up early.
Can't you sleep?

01:10:45.361 --> 01:10:47.281
How about a Moscow Mule?

01:10:48.081 --> 01:10:51.121
I'm practicing a bit,
expanding my portfolio.

01:10:52.441 --> 01:10:54.401
No, thanks.
Have you seen Adam?

01:10:54.921 --> 01:10:58.281
Not since your fight.
- Did he say where he was going?

01:10:58.561 --> 01:11:00.961
He isn't answering his cell,
he's not at home.

01:11:01.321 --> 01:11:04.841
He hit on some idea,
something to do with these pictures.

01:11:06.801 --> 01:11:08.401
He wanted to go to Mallorca?

01:11:09.481 --> 01:11:12.201
No, to Salzgitter.
- Weird, huh?

01:11:15.401 --> 01:11:17.841
The motorhome. Thanks, Earl.

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:20.361
Motorhome?

01:11:30.201 --> 01:11:31.401
Dumb-ass.

01:11:57.521 --> 01:11:59.121
What are you doing here?

01:11:59.481 --> 01:12:02.001
I wanted to tell you
that you were right about my job.

01:12:02.921 --> 01:12:04.761
And I'm sorry about
what I said yesterday.

01:12:05.521 --> 01:12:08.081
So you're not moving out?
- Not yet.

01:12:10.081 --> 01:12:13.801
Don't tell me you want to make out now.
- No tongues?

01:12:14.241 --> 01:12:15.801
That's enough.

01:12:16.521 --> 01:12:18.481
What are you doing here?

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:21.121
I wanted to get the camera
and our footage

01:12:21.481 --> 01:12:22.921
then I couldn't get out...

01:12:24.361 --> 01:12:27.481
And then I did this:
our first wedding movie.

01:12:29.081 --> 01:12:31.801
Whatever's on it, I'm dying to see it.

01:12:32.121 --> 01:12:33.121
<i>Lukas, Adam!</i>

01:12:33.401 --> 01:12:37.281
Is Mila with you?
She's not here and war's broken out!

01:12:37.521 --> 01:12:39.921
Bückstedt, secure the right flank!

01:12:40.161 --> 01:12:43.401
I don't know how long
we can guarantee Martin's safety!

01:12:46.241 --> 01:12:48.881
I know where she is.
- The door's blocked.

01:12:50.161 --> 01:12:52.561
Then like in the old days.
- Right.

01:13:02.241 --> 01:13:04.121
Halt!
- Shit, Lukas.

01:13:05.121 --> 01:13:06.481
Shit!

01:13:08.681 --> 01:13:12.161
Guys, leave those two to Bernd and me.

01:13:21.081 --> 01:13:22.081
The spare key.

01:13:50.481 --> 01:13:52.641
Expanding your portfolio, huh?

01:13:53.001 --> 01:13:56.401
Where is she?
- I don't know what you're talk...

01:13:59.241 --> 01:14:00.761
With Rainer the Eel.

01:14:03.081 --> 01:14:06.001
Don't come any closer.
- Mila?

01:14:06.521 --> 01:14:09.321
This wedding is a complete disaster.

01:14:10.361 --> 01:14:12.601
I look totally disfigured.

01:14:13.241 --> 01:14:15.161
Maybe it was all a mistake.

01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:28.361
Mila, I know
it hasn't always been easy for you, but...

01:14:28.601 --> 01:14:31.081
We don't have time for this.

01:14:32.321 --> 01:14:33.961
Come on!

01:14:43.841 --> 01:14:46.081
Shit! Them again.

01:14:46.441 --> 01:14:47.761
Bertram!

01:14:57.121 --> 01:14:58.121
Poor guy...

01:14:58.481 --> 01:14:59.601
Come on, chin up.

01:15:00.721 --> 01:15:02.161
We'll wait.

01:15:14.561 --> 01:15:17.361
You can't beat a stylish entrance.

01:15:40.681 --> 01:15:42.681
I think we have a situation.

01:15:47.241 --> 01:15:49.001
Lukas!
- Adam!

01:15:49.241 --> 01:15:51.001
Where are you?
- I don't know!

01:15:54.401 --> 01:15:56.601
I told you this clan
would only bring trouble.

01:16:00.241 --> 01:16:01.921
Mila, come out!

01:16:02.161 --> 01:16:03.961
Heinz-Dieter, really.

01:16:12.641 --> 01:16:14.161
Adam, there you are.

01:16:15.281 --> 01:16:17.001
Where's Lukas?

01:16:17.801 --> 01:16:19.481
Finish it, Adam!

01:16:24.601 --> 01:16:25.801
Just a minute!

01:16:28.961 --> 01:16:30.361
The wedding movie.

01:16:35.321 --> 01:16:36.561
Right...

01:16:41.721 --> 01:16:43.241
Give it to me.

01:16:44.481 --> 01:16:48.121
Here we go everybody!
Step right up now! Step right up!

01:16:48.561 --> 01:16:49.921
Here we go!

01:16:51.001 --> 01:16:53.081
It's show time!

01:17:09.481 --> 01:17:11.841
<i>You look terrific, Mrs. Knackstedt.</i>

01:17:21.641 --> 01:17:24.001
<i>That's good.
Carry on, it's awesome.</i>

01:17:56.201 --> 01:17:59.121
<i>Dear Martin, dear Mila.</i>

01:17:59.361 --> 01:18:03.681
<i>When I first met your grandmother Lydia,
my beloved Lydi,</i>

01:18:04.521 --> 01:18:07.041
<i>God rest her soul,</i>

01:18:07.281 --> 01:18:12.801
<i>she was working in a raffle ticket booth
at the Hamburg Port Anniversary.</i>

01:18:13.161 --> 01:18:16.521
<i>I knew right away
that she was the first prize.</i>

01:18:16.761 --> 01:18:19.081
<i>So I bought all the raffle tickets</i>

01:18:19.561 --> 01:18:24.321
<i>and offered to treat her to a fish roll
with my last mark.</i>

01:18:24.921 --> 01:18:27.201
<i>Now, she didn't like fish</i>

01:18:27.841 --> 01:18:30.881
<i>but nevertheless I'd won her heart.</i>

01:18:31.481 --> 01:18:33.921
<i>You never know
where love is going to strike,</i>

01:18:34.161 --> 01:18:38.241
<i>and if you find it,
you should never let it go again.</i>

01:18:39.321 --> 01:18:40.921
<i>So on that note,</i>

01:18:42.001 --> 01:18:44.801
<i>I wish you both the very best.</i>

01:18:45.761 --> 01:18:47.721
<i>From the bottom of my heart.</i>

01:18:50.401 --> 01:18:54.321
Watch out, Willi. This is the best part.
- One more thing.

01:18:54.841 --> 01:18:57.401
<i>And never forget, my dear Martin,</i>

01:18:57.641 --> 01:19:01.121
<i>that you measure a person
by the quality of their friends.</i>

01:19:01.881 --> 01:19:05.201
<i>And looking at your friends
Lukas and Adam,</i>

01:19:06.241 --> 01:19:08.401
<i>I'd say you've done nothing wrong.</i>

01:19:12.561 --> 01:19:13.801
<i>Was that OK?</i>

01:19:16.801 --> 01:19:18.721
The last shot was a bit long,

01:19:19.081 --> 01:19:22.241
but apart from that,
not bad, dear colleague.

01:19:37.601 --> 01:19:39.441
Hey, cutie-pie.

01:20:03.801 --> 01:20:06.081
A brilliant advertising ploy.

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:09.081
Eight new inquiries this week alone.

01:20:09.601 --> 01:20:12.361
What's with the glasses?
- It's my new business look.

01:20:12.601 --> 01:20:13.801
Cool, huh?

01:20:25.241 --> 01:20:27.801
This stuffs totally disgusting,
isn't it?

01:20:28.041 --> 01:20:30.641
Maybe we should drink kümmel instead.

01:20:32.361 --> 01:20:34.241
Scram!
That's enough for today.

01:22:46.481 --> 01:22:50.161
