That's how you sing.

07:50.804 --> 07:52.764

09:05.503 --> 09:08.715
There's a dance competition. The winner

09:16.222 --> 09:17.515

09:38.745 --> 09:39.871

- Yo, what's got you down, girl?
- God!

10:35.969 --> 10:38.513
-Yo, did you ask her?
-Man, I tried.

10:38.596 --> 10:40.098
What? What you mean, you tried?

10:40.181 --> 10:43.434
My dad's tripping, man.
He's not gonna let me go out tonight.

10:43.518 --> 10:46.104
That means I won't be able
to get my tape to DJ Malibu.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.356
She's dead set
on going to Les Inferno tonight.

10:48.439 --> 10:49.399
Les Inferno?

10:49.566 --> 10:52.443
-Yeah.
-Man, that's an epic turn of events, bro!

10:52.527 --> 10:53.903
You gotta get in with a lady.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.697
Those Holy Rollers go to bed early.

10:55.780 --> 10:58.533
We'll wait till your parents are asleep
and then we'll sneak you out.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.161
You'll be back before
anybody knows anything.

11:01.244 --> 11:05.915
<i>♪ Hey, I'm getting some dick tonight</i>
<i>And the feeling's all right ♪</i>

11:05.999 --> 11:08.251
<i>♪ 'Cause my pussy is tight ♪</i>

11:11.004 --> 11:11.838
Yeah!

11:14.632 --> 11:17.135
<i>- ♪ Hey, you ♪</i>

11:19.345 --> 11:23.057
<i>♪ You're losing, you're losing</i>
<i>You're losing, you're losing ♪</i>

11:23.141 --> 11:24.851
<i>♪ Your vitamin C ♪</i>

11:27.520 --> 11:28.855
<i>♪ And you ♪</i>

11:32.233 --> 11:34.152
<i>♪ You're losing, you're losing</i>
<i>You're losing... ♪</i>

11:34.235 --> 11:37.780
See, Shaolin was in the yards,
and saw the dude hot one-ten,

11:37.864 --> 11:40.283
and so he karate-chopped his ass.
Waa-taa!

11:45.288 --> 11:46.873
And that's how the war started.

11:46.956 --> 11:49.542
- How do you know? You talk to Shao?
- Dude, shut up.

11:49.626 --> 11:52.045
No one's ever even seen Shao,
let alone talked to him.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.213
It's not a war they're fighting.

11:54.297 --> 11:57.467
But for all of us.
When we see our names on these trains,

11:57.550 --> 12:01.679
if only even for a fleeting moment,
we can say: "I was here."

12:02.263 --> 12:05.183
Crash, you paint spotlights
and Bat-signals.

12:05.266 --> 12:06.601
Daze, you paint constellations,

12:06.684 --> 12:09.228
breadcrumb trails of sparks
that tell a story.

12:09.312 --> 12:10.605
Shao 007,

12:10.688 --> 12:11.731
<i>man...</i>

12:12.774 --> 12:15.777
<i>his Pumas are always pristine.</i>

12:16.319 --> 12:18.237
<i>His hands are samurai swords.</i>

12:18.613 --> 12:21.407
And his pieces, they're all fireworks.

12:22.325 --> 12:24.035
Big, bright, explosive.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.788
Have you seen Shao's latest?

12:28.331 --> 12:30.291
"Clan of the Dragon Fist."

12:32.835 --> 12:33.670
Wait.

12:34.253 --> 12:35.588
Shaolin Fantastic has a new piece?

12:35.672 --> 12:39.050
-I gotta check it. Where's it at?
-The rubble fields, by Charlotte Street.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.677
- I'm out of here.
- You crazy!

12:40.760 --> 12:43.221
- You're going now?
- Savage Warlords territory, you can't--

12:43.304 --> 12:45.139
A life lived in fear is a life half-lived.

12:45.223 --> 12:46.391
-Say what?
<i>-Ciao </i> for now.

12:46.474 --> 12:48.559
<i>♪ You're losing, you're losing... ♪</i>

12:48.643 --> 12:51.938
Rumi... I like him.
He's weird, though.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.942
<i>♪ Hey, you... ♪</i>

12:56.025 --> 12:59.362
<i>Graffiti vandalism</i>
<i>is a symptom of a far greater sickness.</i>

12:59.445 --> 13:02.281
<i>The colossus on the Hudson</i>
<i>has fallen deathly ill.</i>

13:02.365 --> 13:07.120
<i>Unemployed, crime ridden, graffiti-soaked,</i>
<i>the city's bankruptcy has put its finances</i>

13:07.203 --> 13:11.708
<i>in the hands of un-elected businessmen,</i>
<i>and so the mayoral election is heating up.</i>

13:11.791 --> 13:13.584
<i>Mayor Beame is in bad trouble.</i>

13:13.668 --> 13:18.006
I'm confident we can improve
the quality of life here in our city.

13:18.089 --> 13:21.009
<i> But underdog candidate</i>
<i>Ed Koch is not so sure.</i>

13:21.092 --> 13:22.468
Our mayor's a failure.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.221
<i>Graffiti and crime plague our streets.</i>

13:25.304 --> 13:28.891
<i>Instead of taking responsibility,</i>
<i>he hands responsibility</i>

13:28.975 --> 13:30.518
<i>to corrupt local leaders.</i>

13:30.601 --> 13:33.438
<i>Poverty pimps like Francisco Cruz</i>
<i>in the Bronx.</i>

13:33.855 --> 13:37.025
<i>Cruz lines his pockets</i>
<i>with your tax dollars</i>

13:37.108 --> 13:40.194
<i>while claiming to provide services</i>
<i>to his people.</i>

13:40.278 --> 13:43.072
They're bleeding our resources dry.

13:43.156 --> 13:47.285
<i>Ed Koch for mayor.</i>
<i>Tough, competent, tireless and fair!</i>

13:47.368 --> 13:50.079
What did this Koch call me?

13:50.163 --> 13:51.247
"Poverty pimp,"?

13:51.330 --> 13:54.000
He gets elected,
your whole operation here goes away.

13:54.083 --> 13:55.918
No one will do more for you
than the mayor can.

13:56.002 --> 13:59.005
Koch is a loser.
I'll help Beame get elected,

13:59.088 --> 14:03.176
but if your boss wants votes, he's gotta
help me build something special.

14:03.259 --> 14:06.012
Looks like the goddamned Taj Mahal.

14:06.095 --> 14:07.889
The Charlotte Street Taj Mahal.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.600
You tell the mayor
he has a very simple choice.

14:11.267 --> 14:12.351
Lose the election...

14:14.729 --> 14:16.272
or fund my vision.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.111
So, in order to meet with Malibu,

14:22.195 --> 14:24.405
Mylene gonna have to dance
in a contest at Les Inferno?

14:24.989 --> 14:26.324
All the hustlers up there.

14:26.407 --> 14:28.785
-She gonna fuck around and get turned out.
-Not Mylene.

14:28.868 --> 14:29.786
She ain't like that.

14:30.745 --> 14:31.829
Is she?

14:31.913 --> 14:33.581
Clan of the Dragon Fist!

14:33.873 --> 14:37.168
Over on Charlotte Street.
Clan of the Dragon Fist.

14:37.752 --> 14:40.004
-Your brother's a fucking weirdo.
-You have no idea.

14:40.088 --> 14:41.714
I'm talking about Shao 007.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.384
A new piece on Charlotte Street.
Clan of the Dragon Fist.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.636
But that's Savage Warlords territory!

14:47.303 --> 14:51.057
But it's Shaolin Fantastic.
So, take a deep breath and follow!

14:57.814 --> 14:59.148
Come on.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.461
Shaolin Fantastic, man.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.588
Clan of the Dragon Fist.

15:23.172 --> 15:26.843
Dizz, it's a master blaster.
Yo, tonight, we go to the yards.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.553
You gotta let your hero know you exist.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.432
Not so loud, Boo.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.183
I feel like we're being watched, y'all.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.019
Probably by Shaolin.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.647
I think I seen Shaolin Fantastic
the other day.

15:39.730 --> 15:40.857
No way.

15:41.441 --> 15:43.276
Up on the roof. Flying.

15:45.236 --> 15:46.946
Right there. Roof to roof.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.907
- You see his face?
- No, but I saw the red Pumas.

15:49.991 --> 15:52.535
I heard Shaolin's so slick,
he snuck into Yankee Stadium

15:52.618 --> 15:55.163
and stole Chambliss'
walk-off home run bat.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.747
He fearless, man.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.750
You gotta be
to live in Savage Warlord territory.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.420
-Dizz, man.
-What's up, Boo?

16:02.503 --> 16:06.090
You afraid of Warlords?
I ain't afraid of no stupid Warlords.

16:06.174 --> 16:09.218
Seriously, though,
can we please go now?

16:10.428 --> 16:12.763
Fuck y'all doing on our turf, punks?

16:13.806 --> 16:16.642
We writers, little man, not gangsters.

16:16.726 --> 16:19.145
All we find, all we keep.

16:19.228 --> 16:20.146
Y'all got money?

16:20.229 --> 16:22.648
I said all we find, all we fucking keep!

16:22.732 --> 16:25.818
-Who the fuck y'all looking at?
-Little nigga, let me talk to you.

16:25.902 --> 16:27.528
-Don't touch me.
-Hey, hey!

16:29.322 --> 16:30.323
Boo!

16:30.406 --> 16:31.908
Hey, Boo. Hey, get back, stop!

16:31.991 --> 16:34.535
Savage Warlords are gonna
beat your ass, fuckers!

16:34.619 --> 16:35.453
Get the hell off me!

16:35.536 --> 16:37.163
- Leave my fucking brother alone!
- Get off me.

16:37.246 --> 16:39.373
After I smash his ugly face.

16:39.457 --> 16:41.751
Napoleon!
We told you to fucking look out

16:41.834 --> 16:44.629
and you taking these fools off
for their lunch money?

16:44.712 --> 16:45.630
Yo, bounce.

16:49.675 --> 16:50.676
The fuck's wrong with you?

16:50.760 --> 16:53.763
You begged to be our lookout
at Les Inferno tonight,

16:53.846 --> 16:56.641
-but you can't handle the responsibility!
<i>-Oye, oye, oye.</i>

16:56.724 --> 16:59.852
-Savage Warlords, be on your way.
-Yo, it's Papa Fuerte!

16:59.936 --> 17:02.188
- Everybody else, to school!
- Come on.

17:02.271 --> 17:03.564
Let's go!

17:03.648 --> 17:05.900
<i>Pa fuera de la calle. Fuera de la calle.</i>

17:05.983 --> 17:07.652
- Yo!
- Run! Run!

17:07.734 --> 17:10.946
Anybody wants some static,
still be there by the time I count three.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.449
<i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

17:13.532 --> 17:14.867
Ha!

17:17.703 --> 17:18.663
<i>Que pendejo.</i>

17:20.039 --> 17:21.374
He reminds me of me.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.002
Come on, Stanley, join the party.

17:25.795 --> 17:28.130
"Clan of the Dragora Fist."

17:28.214 --> 17:30.466
I can never make heads or tails
of this graffiti shit.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.884
I'll tell you what, Stanley.

17:31.968 --> 17:36.097
You bring me art classes, art supplies,
and art teachers for our schools here,

17:36.222 --> 17:37.056
and I promise you,

17:37.139 --> 17:39.684
this right here is gonna be
hanging at the MoMA,

17:39.767 --> 17:42.895
not on the side of some
burnt-out buildings or the five train.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.147
Look at that.
Landlord's paying these gangs

17:45.231 --> 17:47.858
to burn buildings
to collect the insurance money.

17:48.276 --> 17:51.153
I got an epidemic on my hands here,
but I gotta hear it

17:51.237 --> 17:55.449
from the fire chief over at Engine 71
that you closed two more firehouses?

17:55.533 --> 17:58.536
I'm down four fucking firehouses
in the last nine months here, Stan.

17:58.619 --> 18:00.538
-The mayor knows he owes you.
-Fuck the mayor!

18:03.583 --> 18:06.502
Listen up. I know some of y'all are gonna

18:06.586 --> 18:10.089
want to make some money this summer,
so remember, Francisco Cruz is offering

18:10.172 --> 18:13.009
paying summer jobs and internships.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.844
Make sure you visit his center,

18:14.927 --> 18:19.473
tell him Ms. Green sent you. I want you
to live with confidence this summer, okay?

18:22.059 --> 18:23.769
Okay, settle down!

18:24.395 --> 18:26.647
Settle down! We are not done yet.

18:26.731 --> 18:28.733
And I got plenty of detention slips

18:28.816 --> 18:30.610
if y'all want to keep acting a fool.

18:30.693 --> 18:32.403
Now, as promised,

18:32.486 --> 18:37.033
it is time for me to announce the winner
of the poetry writing contest.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.661
Imani, please sit.

18:40.745 --> 18:43.039
The winner for the best poem is...

18:45.166 --> 18:46.709
Ezekiel Figuero.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.003
- Aww.
- Everybody applaud. Come on.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.631
My God.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.299
-Faggot!
-Hey.

18:53.382 --> 18:55.092
Faggot.

18:55.176 --> 18:56.761
All right, that's enough, quiet down.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.554
- Brainiac bitch.
- Okay, Ezekiel.

18:58.638 --> 19:02.266
Come on up and get your prize
and recite your poem.

19:02.892 --> 19:05.269
...I can't. I hurt my back.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.980
Is that right? That's fine.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.024
I'll come to you.

19:10.107 --> 19:11.192
Ooh!

19:15.029 --> 19:17.281
-Thanks, Ms. Green.
-"Thanks, Ms. Green."

19:17.365 --> 19:19.617
Mock him again
and I'm going Lady Macbeth on your ass!

19:19.700 --> 19:21.494
- Fuck you.
- Ooh!

19:21.577 --> 19:24.121
I'd like for you to read your poem,
Ezekiel.

19:24.205 --> 19:25.247
Yeah, I'd rather not.

19:26.457 --> 19:27.291
Why not?

19:30.169 --> 19:31.879
Because, I didn't write it.

19:31.962 --> 19:35.549
I copied it from a book. That's all.
Here's your candy back. I'm sorry.

19:35.633 --> 19:36.467
Why you lying?

19:38.469 --> 19:40.179
Whoo! We outta here.

19:40.262 --> 19:41.597
Ezekiel Figuero...

19:42.223 --> 19:44.975
- we need to talk. Okay, everybody.
- Meet me by the flagpole.

19:45.059 --> 19:47.520
Have a great summer.
I'm going to miss you.

19:47.603 --> 19:51.273
- You're my favorite teacher.
- Have a good one. Take some good pictures.

19:51.357 --> 19:55.277
You know, Ezekiel really did write
that poem. Unfortunately, you know,

19:55.361 --> 19:58.364
he's not manly enough
to stand up and admit it.

19:58.447 --> 20:00.074
-Mylene.
-Zeke.

20:00.157 --> 20:01.033
Come on.

20:02.702 --> 20:04.120
Have a great summer, Ms. Green.

20:04.203 --> 20:05.913
-You have a great summer, baby.
-Okay.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.634
Look out onto that vista there, Stanley.

20:19.719 --> 20:20.720
Tell me what you see.

20:21.387 --> 20:22.680
I see a national disgrace.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.974
I see something beautiful, Stan.

20:25.057 --> 20:27.643
I see houses.
Like that model in my office.

20:27.727 --> 20:30.813
Not projects that were built to segregate
and warehouse the working poor.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.023
I see homes, Stan.

20:33.107 --> 20:35.359
Homes for my rainbow people.

20:36.610 --> 20:41.991
I see ball fields for the kids.
A library, right over there.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.744
<i> Full of kids nourishing</i>
<i>their intellectual curiosity.</i>

20:44.827 --> 20:48.748
Prepping for internships,
colleges and good jobs. And over there,

20:48.914 --> 20:51.375
<i>what the hell, a man-made lake.</i>
<i>With ducks, Stan.</i>

20:51.459 --> 20:56.046
I see a proud community. And I see
my contractors building that lake

20:56.130 --> 20:57.715
and constructing these homes.

20:57.798 --> 21:00.885
I see a new South Bronx,
an attainable future for my people.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.888
-That's a hell of a dream, Cisco.
-No, it's not a dream, Stanley.

21:03.971 --> 21:06.390
Your mayor sucks.
Everybody knows it.

21:06.474 --> 21:07.892
In your own words,

21:07.975 --> 21:11.771
he's desperate for me to deliver
20,000 new voters for the primary, right?

21:11.854 --> 21:14.023
- Twenty-five.
- Well, I'm gonna deliver 50,

21:14.106 --> 21:14.982
you keep the change.

21:15.566 --> 21:16.942
<i>Mira,</i> I did the research, Stan.

21:17.026 --> 21:20.029
And those houses are gonna cost
at least ten million.

21:20.696 --> 21:22.740
And your midget mayor,
he's gonna pick up the tab.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.992
-Ten million don't--
-If the mayor wants my loyalty

21:25.075 --> 21:27.161
and my votes and the blood of my people,

21:27.244 --> 21:30.539
then that ten million comes directly
right the fuck here!

21:30.956 --> 21:33.793
I'll make it happen. Okay? You happy?

21:33.876 --> 21:37.463
I'm always happy, Stan.
Sadness is for suckers.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.590
Come on, we'll get an egg cream.

21:52.102 --> 21:53.813
But, Ms. Green, your poetry contest

21:53.896 --> 21:56.023
was poetry writing, not poetry reciting.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.399
So, you did write it.

21:57.483 --> 22:00.986
-I didn't say that.
-I don't know why it is, Ezekiel,

22:01.070 --> 22:05.491
that you seem to want to be nothing,
when with just a little courage...

22:06.325 --> 22:07.743
you could really be something.

22:07.827 --> 22:08.994
I got courage.

22:09.078 --> 22:10.204
No, you don't.

22:10.955 --> 22:12.414
Leaders lead.

22:12.498 --> 22:14.542
Cowards cower.

22:16.252 --> 22:19.129
Now I understand
that your poem is personal.

22:19.213 --> 22:24.009
I understand that it might make you
feel uncomfortable to share it.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.178
But take a look around.

22:26.262 --> 22:28.013
The Bronx is a war zone.

22:29.515 --> 22:32.434
Our community is dying.

22:32.977 --> 22:35.062
And it's gonna take leaders to save it.

22:35.980 --> 22:37.147
That means you.

22:40.234 --> 22:45.531
That is why I have been trying
to get you to stand up

22:45.614 --> 22:47.616
and share your gift with the class.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.995
But every time, you take the easy way out.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.914
Well, luckily for you, I'm probably
not gonna be in school next year.

23:02.047 --> 23:04.341
How would your mother and father feel
if they were alive?

23:05.718 --> 23:07.553
To hear you talking like that?

23:08.304 --> 23:10.889
You live with your aunt and her boyfriend,
right?

23:11.432 --> 23:14.727
Do you think that they took on the burden
of raising you

23:14.810 --> 23:16.645
just so you could drop out of school?

23:17.229 --> 23:21.025
Be dead,
be in jail by the time you turn 21?

23:21.984 --> 23:23.652
-I don't know.
-You don't know.

23:24.320 --> 23:27.114
Maybe I was wrong about you.
Maybe you really didn't write this poem.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.115
I wrote it.

23:30.451 --> 23:31.410
Then prove it.

23:50.721 --> 23:54.308
<i>Boom, then crash</i>
<i>The shattering of glass</i>

23:55.934 --> 23:58.187
<i>I dived to the floor</i>
<i>Busted my ass</i>

23:59.438 --> 24:02.650
<i>"What the hell was that?"</i>
<i>Was all that I said</i>

24:04.985 --> 24:06.612
<i>Then I seen a pool of blood</i>

24:06.695 --> 24:08.364
<i>Then I see my moms was dead</i>

24:09.448 --> 24:12.076
<i>No emotion in the commotion</i>
<i>I wasn't even sad</i>

24:12.159 --> 24:14.745
<i>Even when I learned</i>
<i>That the bullet was meant for my dad</i>

24:15.871 --> 24:18.457
<i>Vietnam made Pops crazy</i>
<i>He was already half-dead</i>

24:18.540 --> 24:21.126
<i>So, why couldn't that have been him</i>
<i>That they shot in the head?</i>

24:21.877 --> 24:23.796
<i>All the news that fits the print</i>

24:24.838 --> 24:28.008
<i>Mama's death went unreported</i>
<i>Not a whiff, word or hint</i>

24:29.176 --> 24:32.054
<i>"They don't care about us niggas"</i>
<i>Is how my pops explained it</i>

24:32.137 --> 24:35.099
<i>But I didn't know I was a nigga</i>
<i>Until my dad proclaimed it</i>

24:36.058 --> 24:38.102
<i>Six months later</i>
<i>My pops was dead, too</i>

24:38.977 --> 24:42.106
<i>Drug-related shots fired</i>
<i>His skin turned cold blue</i>

24:42.189 --> 24:45.275
<i>On the news that night</i>
<i>The president's wife got a new hairdo</i>

24:45.359 --> 24:47.820
<i>The news guy said</i>
<i>"I like it. How about you?"</i>

24:48.529 --> 24:51.448
<i>No word about my pops</i>
<i>In the </i> Post <i>or on CBS</i>

24:52.533 --> 24:54.034
<i>Why was that, you ask?</i>

24:54.118 --> 24:55.577
<i>Take a fucking guess</i>

24:57.663 --> 25:01.625
<i>And, yeah, why is that?</i>
<i>Is what politicians should be asking</i>

25:01.709 --> 25:04.586
<i>But who's got time for questions</i>
<i>When y'all skiing up on Aspen?</i>

25:04.670 --> 25:07.756
<i>Bronx get gunshots to the head</i>
<i>And all y'all swerving us is Aspirin</i>

25:07.840 --> 25:10.426
<i>My mama was so lovely</i>
<i>She would have made your head spin</i>

25:10.509 --> 25:13.011
<i>Level the playing field</i>
<i>And y'all would see who would really win</i>

25:13.095 --> 25:14.471
<i>And, yeah, I got anger</i>

25:15.681 --> 25:18.225
<i>But I don't let it take me down</i>
<i>Because my mama taught me better</i>

25:18.308 --> 25:20.144
<i>And she holds me up when I fall down</i>

25:22.730 --> 25:24.064
<i>Rest in peace, Moms</i>

25:24.690 --> 25:26.108
<i>Don't worry about your son</i>

25:28.861 --> 25:31.989
<i>Someday I'll make you proud</i>
<i>Because, yeah, I am the one</i>

25:34.950 --> 25:36.076
Ezekiel...

25:37.745 --> 25:40.956
there are opportunities out there
for your advancement.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.083
Francisco Cruz, he...

25:56.930 --> 25:58.724
<i>♪ Step out in the limelight... ♪</i>

26:00.058 --> 26:03.896
What if Malibu will only listen to
your tape if you get down with him?

26:03.979 --> 26:05.022
What you gonna do then?

26:05.105 --> 26:06.356
Listen, he's not like that.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.234
My God, Mylene.
You don't know nothing about the world.

26:09.318 --> 26:12.905
So, you hit her with the poetry
and she still said no? That's cold.

26:12.988 --> 26:15.741
I don't know, man.
I'm trying everything I got, Ra.

26:15.824 --> 26:18.327
Well, listen, man.
Mylene's looking for a man.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.996
Dress slick, right? Act smooth.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.915
Savoir faire, man.

26:22.998 --> 26:26.627
These are men, Mylene.
Look, it's different.

26:26.710 --> 26:30.130
Like, last time I was there,
I met this dude, Little Wolf.

26:30.214 --> 26:32.257
He's Cadillac's main man,

26:32.341 --> 26:35.010
and I mean, he was so fine,

26:35.093 --> 26:39.807
and like, he had gap!
I'm talking about g-money like this!

26:40.390 --> 26:42.810
Took me to a high post hotel and stuff.

26:42.893 --> 26:44.311
Howard Johnson's is high post?

26:44.394 --> 26:46.730
Well, they had
good room service and champagne.

26:47.815 --> 26:49.650
Listen, I'm gonna give you some advice.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.486
You let Malibu take you to the hotel.

26:52.569 --> 26:53.403
Shit.

26:53.487 --> 26:57.533
You sing a sexy song for him
in your lingerie and shit.

26:58.200 --> 27:00.327
Shake your little <i>culo.</i>

27:00.410 --> 27:01.578
<i> Culo?</i>

27:02.204 --> 27:03.247
That's how you get a record deal.

27:03.330 --> 27:05.082
Fucking Howard Johnson, Ra?

27:05.165 --> 27:08.544
You need to calm down, first of all.
Both of y'all need to calm down.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.046
Fuck! You're right, Ra.
We gotta get into Les Inferno.

27:11.129 --> 27:12.297
Stop.

27:12.422 --> 27:14.591
you can't sweat a freak, man.

27:14.675 --> 27:17.719
I'm not planning on getting down
with nobody, all right?

27:17.845 --> 27:20.264
-You have to show up looking fly.
-Yeah.

27:20.347 --> 27:22.975
-With the suave bolla. Okay?
-Suave-- Okay.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.394
I just wanna meet DJ Malibu
and give him my tape,

27:25.477 --> 27:27.604
so I can get out of my father's church
and never look back.

27:27.688 --> 27:30.482
-That's it.
-You have to get her something. A gift.

27:30.566 --> 27:31.400
Okay.

27:31.483 --> 27:33.360
Not expensive
because you ain't got no money.

27:33.861 --> 27:36.154
But, you know, something that says:

27:37.030 --> 27:38.156
"I know you, girl.

27:39.283 --> 27:44.997
I know you deep into your Taino
Puerto Rican punany, <i>mamasita.</i>"

27:45.080 --> 27:46.498
Don't talk about her like that.

27:46.915 --> 27:49.418
Look, number one:
you need to be there to dance with her.

27:49.501 --> 27:52.588
you need to be dangerous.

27:52.963 --> 27:53.839
Okay.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.633
Any dude that messes with her
gotta get the hammer.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.261
Bang, bang. It's over.

27:59.344 --> 28:02.014
Where the hell would I cop a gun?
It's a stupid idea.

28:02.097 --> 28:03.473
-Stupid.
-Look, man.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.684
The gun's a personal choice.

28:22.576 --> 28:25.245
That Clan of the Dragon Fist piece
was fly.

28:25.329 --> 28:28.123
But let it be your last,
and focus, Grasshopper.

28:28.206 --> 28:30.959
Tonight your quest will end
and your journey will begin

28:31.043 --> 28:33.086
if you bring me back the Pakoussa.

28:33.170 --> 28:35.589
The Pakoussa? By Misty Holloway?

28:36.214 --> 28:39.009
-Where is it?
-The Jamaican on Charlotte Street.

28:39.384 --> 28:41.637
Protected by the Warlords, so watch out.

28:42.179 --> 28:44.264
Bring me back the Pakoussa, Grasshopper.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.016
Osu.

28:51.688 --> 28:52.773
And Grasshopper!

28:53.982 --> 28:55.943
Have you found yourself a wordsmith yet?

28:56.568 --> 28:57.402
Not yet.

28:57.778 --> 29:00.447
Then you must learn
to trust and choose wisely.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.658
You're well-liked but always alone.

29:03.367 --> 29:05.118
The journey requires a wordsmith.

29:05.786 --> 29:08.038
Bring me the Pakoussa by midnight,
Grasshopper.

29:11.959 --> 29:13.001
Whoo!

29:15.754 --> 29:16.588
The gift.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.258
It's a must-have,
and it's gotta be personal.

29:19.341 --> 29:20.175
So, what's she like?

29:20.259 --> 29:22.761
-Perfume? Clothes?
-That "Far, Far Away" joint.

29:22.844 --> 29:24.846
-Misty Holloway?
-The remix, by Carlo Pakoussa.

29:24.930 --> 29:27.599
She crazy for it. Plus, it's rare.
I heard they only made like 50 copies.

29:27.683 --> 29:29.685
That Jamaican's spot
on Charlotte Street got rare stuff.

29:29.768 --> 29:31.812
Boom! Get that shit.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.272
- Get in the club.
- Yeah.

29:33.355 --> 29:34.189
Get the DJ to play it.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.524
-Okay. Yeah.
-Right?

29:35.607 --> 29:36.817
Okay. Wait, wait, wait.

29:37.317 --> 29:38.735
Then you take her in your arms.

29:39.278 --> 29:42.447
You sweep her up,
and you dance a sexy hustle.

29:42.572 --> 29:44.783

-Um, <i>Wars on Mars.</i>
<i>-Mars Wars.</i>

35:13.361 --> 35:14.613

35:14.696 --> 35:16.114

35:51.441 --> 35:54.653

I quit writing graffiti.

35:54.736 --> 35:57.656
Well, I just saw "Rumi 411" on the wall.

35:57.739 --> 35:59.115

36:07.374 --> 36:09.626

36:13.421 --> 36:14.923
I was thinking,
you can't be dancing

36:15.006 --> 36:17.133
in this contest at Les Inferno
by yourself.

36:17.217 --> 36:19.260
Maybe we could dance together.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.846
Together?
You know they don't let kids in there.

36:21.971 --> 36:24.808

appears in the train yards?

36:54.754 --> 36:56.172
- Run.
- Good.

36:56.256 --> 36:58.675
'Cause Shao'll pull your pants down

37:01.136 --> 37:04.806

37:04.889 --> 37:08.017
Yo, Zeke ain't gonna get into
Les Inferno by himself, you know?

37:08.101 --> 37:11.688
I just hope he doesn't keep asking me
'cause I can't, like, reject him again.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.273
- Mylene.
- Poor Zeke.

37:13.356 --> 37:16.943
-I feel bad for your man.
-Yolanda, Zeke is my friend.

37:17.902 --> 37:20.530
-Not my man, okay?
-That means I could go out with him?

37:20.613 --> 37:22.657
- I didn't say that.
- 'Cause you like him.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.576
-Let's just figure out what I'm wearing.
-Yeah!

from Shaolin, remember,

37:27.203 --> 37:28.747
what rail do you watch out for?

37:28.830 --> 37:30.832
Duh. The third rail.

37:30.915 --> 37:33.877

37:54.355 --> 37:56.608
No, man. You gonna have to fly solo, man.

37:56.691 --> 37:59.277
-Solo?
-To Les Inferno. You gotta go alone.

37:59.360 --> 38:01.738
But when you storm the gates,
you need to dress to kill, man.

38:01.821 --> 38:05.033

57:51.635 --> 57:53.929
Grown and imported by his father.

-We're not a couple.
-Let's start. Let's make it official.

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:11.569
-Zeke--
-I wanna be your man, Mylene.

01:07:12.111 --> 01:07:13.112
I know you like me.

01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:17.158
And I like you so much,
I can't hardly breathe.

01:07:17.242 --> 01:07:21.204
I like you so much, I feel like I got
thunder and lightning inside of me.

01:07:21.287 --> 01:07:23.206
You make me nervous.

01:07:23.915 --> 01:07:25.208
But you also make me calm.

01:07:26.042 --> 01:07:26.876
Real calm.

01:07:27.919 --> 01:07:31.798
Calm almost like how God must be calm,
you know, Mylene? Calm from loving.

01:07:33.550 --> 01:07:34.384
I love you.

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:38.263
Mylene, I love you.

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:41.766
What do you think about that?

01:07:45.103 --> 01:07:47.772
Okay, look. I don't mean
to be conceited or nothing.

01:07:47.855 --> 01:07:49.607
You know I'm not like that anyway.

01:07:49.691 --> 01:07:51.901
But if you see how you're
looking at me now,

01:07:51.985 --> 01:07:54.737
that ain't the look of someone
who don't like someone.

01:07:54.821 --> 01:07:55.655
So, come on.

01:07:58.074 --> 01:07:59.617
What do you say??

01:08:07.917 --> 01:08:08.751
No.

01:08:10.712 --> 01:08:12.380
No. Because I'm gonna be a singer, Zeke,

01:08:12.463 --> 01:08:15.091
-I'm gonna be a disco star.
-I know you will. I know.

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:17.260
And someday soon,
I'm gonna cross that East River,

01:08:17.343 --> 01:08:20.013
and I can't let anybody
distract me from that.

01:08:20.095 --> 01:08:21.973
-I won't distract you.
-Yes, you will.

01:08:23.140 --> 01:08:25.768
And it's sad because you are so gifted.

01:08:25.852 --> 01:08:29.022
You're so smart
and you just mess around with it.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:32.524
Like today in class when you were supposed
to stand up and do that poem.

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:34.861
You say you want me,

01:08:34.944 --> 01:08:38.113
but you don't know
what it is that you want. But I do.

01:08:39.407 --> 01:08:42.493
And even if I was gonna be with somebody,
which I'm not,

01:08:42.577 --> 01:08:46.372
I'm gonna be with a man
that has goals and has a plan.

01:08:46.456 --> 01:08:48.374
Not a kid from the neighborhood.

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:50.585
Not a boy. Not you.

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:53.379
-Mylene--
-Not now.

01:08:53.462 --> 01:08:54.631
If you give it a chance--

01:08:54.714 --> 01:08:57.091
I don't love you, Zeke. I don't love you.

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:04.015
And it's quits.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.144
Mylene.

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:31.084
"Even in the darkness,
there is light, for God is gracious,

01:09:31.209 --> 01:09:32.292
and tells us,

01:09:32.377 --> 01:09:36.673
'Ye be kind to one another,
tender hearted, forgiving for one another,

01:09:36.756 --> 01:09:39.425
as God in Christ forgave you.'"

01:09:40.093 --> 01:09:41.803
<i>Dios mío.</i> What are you wearing?

01:09:41.886 --> 01:09:42.929
Ramon <i>, tranquilo.</i>

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:44.013
<i>¡Tranquilo nada!</i>

01:09:44.889 --> 01:09:45.723
Cover yourself.

01:09:45.807 --> 01:09:46.765
<i>-¡Tranquilo nada!</i>
-Ramon!

01:09:50.103 --> 01:09:52.563
Have any idea what time it is?
Your mother almost died.

01:09:52.647 --> 01:09:54.357
-I'm sorry.
<i>-Casi me da un </i> heart attack.

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:55.274
Look at yourself.

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:56.943
Look at you. Our own daughter.

01:09:57.402 --> 01:09:58.277
A teenage whore.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:09:59.904
-Ramon!
-<i>Puta</i>, Lydia.

01:09:59.987 --> 01:10:02.407
I went out with my friends
to listen to music.

01:10:02.490 --> 01:10:04.200
I didn't drink, I didn't smoke--

01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:06.160
-You didn't drink? You didn't drink?
-No.

01:10:06.244 --> 01:10:07.370
-No, no.
-You didn't smoke? No?

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:09.831
<i>Mentirosa.</i> Again, you are a liar.

01:10:09.914 --> 01:10:12.959
I may have had one drink
and a cigarette, <i>pero</i> Mami,

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:14.502
-that's what teenagers do.
-Ramon!

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:16.546
-No, not my teenager. Not you.
-Ramon, <i>por favor.</i>

01:10:16.629 --> 01:10:17.839
No "Ramon"! And this?

01:10:17.922 --> 01:10:21.217
You want to be like Misty Holloway?
What is this disco garbage?

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.301
It's poison.

01:10:22.385 --> 01:10:25.888
You are not this. You will never be this.

01:10:25.972 --> 01:10:28.516
Do you understand me?
You'll never be this. Never be this!

01:10:28.599 --> 01:10:30.143
-You went through my things?
-Yes!

01:10:30.226 --> 01:10:31.978
I will not tolerate blasphemy.

01:10:32.061 --> 01:10:33.938
You will not associate with garbage.

01:10:34.522 --> 01:10:36.482
You will not sing disco,
and from now on,

01:10:36.566 --> 01:10:38.359
you will never leave this house. Ever.

01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:40.194
I will sing, <i>Papi</i>.
And you cannot stop me.

01:10:40.278 --> 01:10:41.654
I can't stop you?

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:42.905
-No!
-I'll show you how I stop you.

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:44.824
- Ramon!
- I'll show how I stop you!

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:46.617
- I will beat the evil out of you.
- Ramon!

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:49.954
I'll beat it out of you!
You are my darling angel.

01:10:50.037 --> 01:10:51.539
I will beat you all night

01:10:51.622 --> 01:10:53.708
- to separate from you and <i>El Diablo!</i>
- No!

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:56.002
-No, Ramon! Ramon! Stop it.
-No! You cannot.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.795
- No!
- No, no!

01:10:57.879 --> 01:10:59.964
Let her go! No! No!

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:01.048
Lydia!

01:11:01.716 --> 01:11:03.176
Go to your uncle!

01:11:04.635 --> 01:11:05.470
I...

01:11:09.474 --> 01:11:12.101
We were in the studio,
finishing up the rhythm track.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.227
I'm producing.

01:11:13.311 --> 01:11:14.771
We're this close. We're so close.

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:17.106
And right outside the door,
good old Hector,

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.859
he's got like,
five chicks that wanna blow him,

01:11:19.942 --> 01:11:21.068
-three dope dealers.
-No.

01:11:21.152 --> 01:11:23.362
Now that your luck's gone bad,
you're telling stories.

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:26.157
I wanna do one more overdub
because I'm a perfectionist.

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.992
There's a reason I got three Grammys.

01:11:29.452 --> 01:11:31.329
- <i>¿Qué?</i>
<i>- I need to talk to my uncle.</i>

01:11:31.412 --> 01:11:33.706
<i>¿Qué te pasa? Pero dime que te pasó.</i>

01:11:33.790 --> 01:11:35.291
How much is the music producer in for?

01:11:35.374 --> 01:11:38.085
- Mylene, calm down, please.
- He's down 25 large.

01:11:38.169 --> 01:11:39.212
<i>La sobrina.</i>

01:11:43.174 --> 01:11:44.050
<i>¿Nena?</i>

01:11:45.218 --> 01:11:47.053
And she's right. I ain't shit.

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:50.306
I ain't ever gonna be shit.
She has no business being with me.

01:11:50.389 --> 01:11:53.184
I just-- I'll probably--

01:11:54.393 --> 01:11:58.648
I'll probably end up working in a fucking
supermarket my whole fucking life!

01:12:00.024 --> 01:12:03.778
Can you fill us in with anything
about Les Inferno? The shoot-out?

01:12:03.861 --> 01:12:05.279
My heart got shot out.

01:12:05.363 --> 01:12:06.823
My fucking heart got shot out.

01:12:15.873 --> 01:12:17.750
Yo, osu, wordsmith.

01:12:17.834 --> 01:12:18.835
Who the fuck is that?

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.802
Some wild, wild west shit back there.

01:12:27.885 --> 01:12:30.388
This motherfucker
with the fake karate and shit.

01:12:31.681 --> 01:12:34.225
Now what did I do?

01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:38.563
I got you in.

01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:41.357
I got Malibu, who's dead,
to play the record,

01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.110
which in fact is the last record
that he'll ever play.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.153
While motherfuckers shooting
from both sides,

01:12:46.237 --> 01:12:48.155
while your stupid ass is trying
to get the record

01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:50.992
off of Malibu's turntables,
all for a bitch

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:53.035
-who thinks she's better than you.
-Don't call her a bitch.

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:54.287
A motherfucking bitch!

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.914
-Don't call her a bitch!
-Sit your ass down.

01:12:56.998 --> 01:12:57.999
Yo, you got the gift.

01:12:58.082 --> 01:13:00.877
But you look like a bitch
crying over a bitch.

01:13:02.879 --> 01:13:04.839
I don't understand all the crying
over a female.

01:13:04.922 --> 01:13:06.132
You don't know. You don't know.

01:13:06.215 --> 01:13:08.175
I don't know? I don't know? About what?

01:13:09.385 --> 01:13:11.721
-Not about to say "love," are you?
-What if I did?

01:13:11.804 --> 01:13:15.099
Then I say you're fucking right,
I don't understand anything about love.

01:13:15.182 --> 01:13:17.310
Who is this dude, man?

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.186
- Yeah, who the fuck is this dude?
- Yo,

01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:21.480
- who you getting loud with, shortstop?
- Hey.

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:24.775
-You, nigga.
-Aww, little munchkin.

01:13:24.859 --> 01:13:26.235
Hey, man. We're all cool.

01:13:26.861 --> 01:13:27.862
We're all cool.

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:28.988
Let me see this.

01:13:31.449 --> 01:13:33.075
I write, maybe y'all seen me up.

01:13:41.751 --> 01:13:43.336
- Whoa.
- No!

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.087
- No!
- Get the fuck outta here.

01:13:45.171 --> 01:13:46.213
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:13:46.297 --> 01:13:48.674
You're Shaolin Fantastic?

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.134
The lady-killing romantic.

01:13:50.217 --> 01:13:51.344
Hell, no.

01:13:52.053 --> 01:13:53.763
Yo, Zeke. Is this really him?

01:13:53.846 --> 01:13:55.848
I don't know. I just met the dude.

01:13:55.932 --> 01:13:57.558
Hey, man. Just look at his shoes.

01:13:57.642 --> 01:14:00.853
Bro, this little guy--
This is my brother, Boo-Boo.

01:14:00.937 --> 01:14:02.313
And that's my other brother, Ra-Ra.

01:14:03.022 --> 01:14:03.856
Do you know who I am?

01:14:09.737 --> 01:14:10.947
Rumi 411.

01:14:11.614 --> 01:14:13.032
You stay up with Crash and Daze.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:15.368
You also down with the Soul Artists?

01:14:15.743 --> 01:14:16.786
I spray all-city.

01:14:17.370 --> 01:14:18.704
Yo, where's my record at, man?

01:14:18.788 --> 01:14:21.040
-You like Misty Holloway that much?
-Where's my record?!

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:23.876
Here's your fucking record.
Here. Go fetch.

01:14:28.547 --> 01:14:30.299
Why do you need the record?

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:31.717
It's for the get down.

01:14:32.969 --> 01:14:34.220
What's the get down?

01:14:36.514 --> 01:14:38.099
You don't know what the get down is?

01:14:38.766 --> 01:14:41.644
You're a natural, and you don't know
who Grandmaster Flash is?

01:14:41.727 --> 01:14:44.063
Shit. All right, punks.

01:14:44.772 --> 01:14:46.691
Y'all want to go to the flyest...

01:14:47.650 --> 01:14:50.069
secret underground party
in the entire Bronx...

01:14:50.778 --> 01:14:51.612
you follow me.

01:14:52.655 --> 01:14:53.489
You decide.

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:57.576
Let's go.

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:08.462
- Yo.
- Shao. What's up?

01:15:08.546 --> 01:15:10.339
They with me, all right? All of them.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:19.974
Yo!

01:15:24.687 --> 01:15:25.730
Aseke.

01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:35.072
Hey!

01:15:38.743 --> 01:15:40.077
My God.

01:15:44.707 --> 01:15:46.417
Ra, this is crazy cool.

01:15:53.007 --> 01:15:54.425
B-boy hard rocks in here.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:56.010
They don't like outsiders.

01:15:56.093 --> 01:15:57.553
Like, they really don't play, man.

01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:59.472
Y'all gotta pretend like y'all know
what's what.

01:16:01.932 --> 01:16:03.851
Why y'all look so scared, man? Come on.

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:05.269
Yo, Shaolin!

But have you found your wordsmith yet?

01:16:45.810 --> 01:16:49.105
I think I found him tonight.
So, can you teach me how to DJ now?

01:16:49.188 --> 01:16:52.191
I'm ready right now, Grandmaster.
Just show me the magic.

01:16:52.358 --> 01:16:54.485
Tomorrow we begin. But tonight?

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:56.070

01:16:58.906 --> 01:17:00.199

01:17:11.919 --> 01:17:12.878
Whoo!

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:18.634
The Grandmaster pinpoints
the get down part.

01:17:19.552 --> 01:17:21.762
Sometimes the drums only play
for ten seconds,

01:17:21.846 --> 01:17:24.849
and the rest of the record
is violins and singing and shit.

01:17:25.516 --> 01:17:29.145
He won't play that bullshit,
so he plays the same record on two decks.

01:17:30.479 --> 01:17:33.774
While the get down plays on one,
he cues the same part on two.

01:17:35.609 --> 01:17:38.737
Now, I don't know how he knows
exactly when to do it,

01:17:38.821 --> 01:17:41.699
but the moment one finishes,
bang, he flips the mixer...

01:17:42.449 --> 01:17:43.826
the beat goes on and on.

01:17:45.286 --> 01:17:47.830
The beat goes on, the wordsmith can go on.

01:17:48.789 --> 01:17:50.875
Man, what the fuck is the wordsmith?

01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:54.670

Over here are his rivals.

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.504
Bambaataa and the Zulus.

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:41.673
And who's right here?

01:27:41.757 --> 01:27:43.550
- We are.
- Yeah, well...

01:27:45.343 --> 01:27:46.720
Right now, right here...

01:27:47.763 --> 01:27:50.390
and will always forever be the land...

01:27:51.099 --> 01:27:51.975
the kingdom...

01:27:53.226 --> 01:27:54.436
of Grandmaster Flash.

01:27:56.730 --> 01:27:58.482
Yeah, but what about our kingdom?

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:00.776
Well...

01:28:00.859 --> 01:28:01.902
that's a good question.

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:06.406
Y'all want your own kingdom,
or you wanna...

01:28:06.823 --> 01:28:08.950
be peasants in someone else's kingdom?

01:28:09.034 --> 01:28:10.035
We want our own kingdom.

01:28:13.705 --> 01:28:14.915
Then so it shall be.

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:18.126
Stick with me and we'll run shit.

01:28:18.794 --> 01:28:20.587
We'll be musical kings.

01:28:20.670 --> 01:28:22.464
Fantastic Four Plus One.

01:28:23.131 --> 01:28:25.091
Running shit

01:28:54.287 --> 01:28:55.121

01:28:56.706 --> 01:28:59.835
You and me, the Jackson Five
Kipling brothers over there...

01:29:01.795 --> 01:29:03.380
I don't know who can fuck with us.

01:29:04.506 --> 01:29:06.550
Plus, you're a natural wordsmith, man.

01:29:06.633 --> 01:29:07.467
-Yeah?

01:29:18.979 --> 01:29:20.272

Yo. Everybody, gather around.

Yo, Shao, man.

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:36.798
This is where you stay at?

01:25:36.882 --> 01:25:38.717
You know,
other than staying at my girl's crib.

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.553
That's where I keep my custom AJ Lesters.

01:25:41.678 --> 01:25:42.929
- Custom?
- Hoo-hoo!

01:25:43.013 --> 01:25:44.056
He said custom?

01:25:44.723 --> 01:25:46.558
Yo, so how do you rig up the electric?

01:25:46.642 --> 01:25:47.768
You wired it yourself?

01:25:47.851 --> 01:25:50.187
-Magic. Says who?
-No such thing.

01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:52.147
Boo! Be careful, man!

01:25:53.357 --> 01:25:55.692
How the fuck do you brush your teeth?

01:25:55.901 --> 01:25:58.570
Yo, the city ain't cut off
the water in the building yet.

01:25:58.654 --> 01:26:01.365
- Shit, there is water. He ain't lying.
- Man.

01:26:01.948 --> 01:26:03.700
If I knew Flash's secret,

01:26:03.784 --> 01:26:06.536
-I could extend the get down right here.
-This-- This--

01:26:06.828 --> 01:26:08.705

01:26:08.789 --> 01:26:10.165
Yo, yo. Yo, Shao.

-Yo.
-The sun's coming up.

01:26:11.458 --> 01:26:12.668
I can't see the train here.

01:26:12.751 --> 01:26:14.628
-Can we get on the roof?
-Let's hit the roof.

01:26:14.711 --> 01:26:16.004
To the roof!

01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:17.547
All right. Let's do it.

01:26:17.631 --> 01:26:19.591
- Yo, yo, yo.
- All-city.

01:26:19.675 --> 01:26:21.426
I'm the king of New York.

01:26:24.262 --> 01:26:25.764
- Heads up.
- Snap.

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:28.642
Stick with me, little man.
I'll teach you how to fly. Hoo!

01:26:28.725 --> 01:26:30.477
-Yo, Zeke.
-Yeah, bro?

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:32.354
Tonight was pretty dope, right?

01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:33.522
Yeah, bro. Yeah.

01:26:34.106 --> 01:26:35.941
Shaolin Fantastic, he's kind of cool?

01:26:36.024 --> 01:26:36.942
Yeah, he is.

01:26:38.235 --> 01:26:40.946
Hey, hey. Brah, brah, come on.
You're cool, too.

01:26:41.947 --> 01:26:44.950
-Don't you wanna see Dizzee's burner?
-Last one up eats a dick.

01:26:45.242 --> 01:26:46.493
Hey, fuck you!

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.787
- Motherfucker.
- Hey, Shao.

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:49.955
Will you sign my book?

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:51.832
I'll do one better.

01:26:52.791 --> 01:26:54.584
I'm retiring from my writing.

01:26:56.378 --> 01:26:57.754
Gonna be a full-time DJ.

01:26:59.464 --> 01:27:00.924
So, all my stuff downstairs...

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:03.385
it's all you, Rumi.

01:27:05.429 --> 01:27:06.263
For real?

01:27:06.930 --> 01:27:07.764
For real.

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:09.391
Thanks.

01:27:09.975 --> 01:27:12.519
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.
Huddle up, fellas, huddle up.

01:27:12.602 --> 01:27:13.979
Huddle around. Let's do it.

01:27:14.771 --> 01:27:16.732
I'm about to introduce you
to the three kingdoms.

01:27:17.441 --> 01:27:21.319
Okay? We got the west.
There's the land of DJ Kool Herc.

01:27:21.403 --> 01:27:24.239
-Who's Kool Herc?
-If you don't know who Kool Herc is,

01:27:24.322 --> 01:27:25.699
you need to ask somebody.

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:27.367
Well, I am asking somebody.

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:33.790
Let's just say
he has the biggest sound in the Bronx.

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:36.168
Over here are his rivals.

01:27:37.919 --> 01:27:39.504
Bambaataa and the Zulus.

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:41.673
