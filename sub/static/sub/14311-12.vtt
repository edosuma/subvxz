00:20.108 --> 00:21.193
I need to see my aunt.

00:21.360 --> 00:23.070
- May Parker.
- Room 204.

00:23.237 --> 00:24.279
Eddie, why are you--?

00:24.446 --> 00:26.990
Because I still remember
what a great lady she is.

00:27.157 --> 00:29.076
When Gwen told me
Aunt May was here...

00:29.243 --> 00:32.079
...I figured it was worth
stomaching you for her sake.

00:32.246 --> 00:34.248
Should've guessed
it wouldn't be an issue.

00:34.414 --> 00:37.501
I mean, why would you be here?

00:37.668 --> 00:40.629
She's only the woman
who raised you.

00:44.716 --> 00:46.468
Yes, she's in recovery.

00:46.635 --> 00:48.637
In fact, she's doing very well.

00:48.804 --> 00:50.514
See, Peter, I told you.

00:50.681 --> 00:52.724
Aunt May, you had a heart attack.

00:52.891 --> 00:55.018
- A little one.
- Thankfully.

00:55.185 --> 00:57.020
But you shouldn't treat this lightly.

00:57.187 --> 00:58.897
We won't. Thanks, doc.

00:59.064 --> 01:02.734
I am feeling much better
now that I know you're all right.

01:02.901 --> 01:04.694
I'm so sorry I wasn't here sooner--

01:04.861 --> 01:06.738
Peter, you came
as soon as you heard.

01:06.905 --> 01:09.074
- But now it's time for you to go.
- What?

01:09.241 --> 01:11.159
It's a school day, young man.

01:11.326 --> 01:15.205
I wish I'd thought to pack you a lunch
before this whole heart thing happened.

01:18.542 --> 01:20.002
Excuse me, Mr. Parker?

01:20.168 --> 01:22.754
I just need you to sign
a few forms for your aunt.

01:24.131 --> 01:25.841
You are next of kin?

01:26.008 --> 01:28.552
- We're our only kin.
- Your bill's on the second page.

01:42.941 --> 01:44.276
Peter?

01:44.443 --> 01:45.902
- How are you?
- How's your aunt?

01:46.069 --> 01:48.405
Petey, I was so worried about you.

01:48.572 --> 01:50.365
Wait, you all know?

01:50.532 --> 01:53.118
I spilled, tiger. Sorry.

01:53.285 --> 01:55.203
We all just wanna help.

01:55.370 --> 01:56.413
Help?

01:56.580 --> 02:00.834
Help? That's a good one.
How exactly do you plan on helping?

02:01.001 --> 02:03.253
Do my homework,
maybe lower my GPA?

02:03.420 --> 02:05.380
Borrow my camera?
Take some Spidey pics?

02:05.547 --> 02:08.383
I do need the money.
I got humongous hospital bills to pay.

02:08.550 --> 02:10.719
We're just trying to be your friends.

02:10.886 --> 02:13.889
Well, unless my friends are prepared
to pony up some cash...

02:14.056 --> 02:16.600
...they can keep their help
and their sympathy.

02:16.767 --> 02:19.853
- What am I even doing here?
- Pete. Wait.

02:23.899 --> 02:26.026
<i>We don't need friends.
We need money.</i>

02:26.193 --> 02:29.446
<i>And more than that skinflint Jameson
would ever fork over.</i>

02:29.613 --> 02:32.032
<i>But he's not the only game in town.</i>

02:46.880 --> 02:48.465
Are you quite through?

02:48.632 --> 02:50.634
Sure, Tombie. I've proven my point.

02:50.801 --> 02:51.968
Which is?

02:52.135 --> 02:54.554
That I can still take anything
you can dish.

02:54.721 --> 02:56.139
Which leaves one question.

02:56.890 --> 03:00.310
That job offer still on the table?

04:05.292 --> 04:09.337
I still think you'd make
an invaluable employee, Spider-Man.

04:09.504 --> 04:14.342
But you'll forgive me if I'm suspicious
of your sudden change of heart.

04:14.509 --> 04:17.637
You need to prove you're
prepared to behave.

04:17.803 --> 04:19.930
Fight no crime for one week.

04:20.098 --> 04:23.602
You have dispensation if a supervillain
endangers public safety...

04:23.769 --> 04:26.062
...but no ordinary crime.

04:26.229 --> 04:28.440
- Deal?
- Deal.

04:30.025 --> 04:31.818
I'm afraid that's the deal.

04:32.027 --> 04:35.363
The loss of the alien life form
means the loss of another grant.

04:35.530 --> 04:38.325
The lab can no longer afford
to keep you on the payroll.

04:38.533 --> 04:39.785
But I need that money.

04:39.951 --> 04:42.496
Without it, I'll have to drop out of ESU.

04:42.662 --> 04:47.167
I'm sorry, Eddie, truly,
but the funds just aren't there.

04:49.628 --> 04:51.087
Anyone sitting here?

04:51.254 --> 04:53.173
No. No, nobody.

04:53.340 --> 04:56.301
- I misplaced my clique.
- Sounds rough.

04:56.885 --> 04:59.554
The rough part's
not knowing how to help.

04:59.721 --> 05:02.724
Harry's in Europe.

05:02.891 --> 05:03.934
And Pete...

05:04.100 --> 05:07.646
You like Pete a lot, don't you?

05:08.230 --> 05:09.731
Well, yeah, I like Pete.

05:09.898 --> 05:11.775
I mean, of course I like him.

05:11.942 --> 05:13.527
I like him. He likes me.

05:13.693 --> 05:16.863
We like. It's a mutual like fest.

05:17.072 --> 05:18.865
That's not what I meant.

05:19.074 --> 05:21.993
You mean do I "like him" like him?

05:22.160 --> 05:26.414
Well, what if the answer's yes?

05:26.581 --> 05:27.624
I get it.

05:27.791 --> 05:30.585
You and Pete,
you've always been "just friends."

05:31.002 --> 05:32.587
And it's hard to risk that.

05:32.754 --> 05:34.881
But if that's not what you want,
girlfriend...

05:35.090 --> 05:36.758
...you'll have to step up.

05:36.925 --> 05:40.095
Smart as he is,
Pete's not likely to wise up.

05:40.262 --> 05:43.682
<i>I mean, he's still a guy.</i>

05:57.320 --> 05:58.655
Yo, bro.

05:58.822 --> 06:00.198
You cost me my job.

06:00.365 --> 06:01.867
Shut it.

06:02.033 --> 06:03.994
We're tired of your whining.

06:04.160 --> 06:06.121
Hey, hey, hey. What's this now?

06:06.288 --> 06:08.290
Shove off, Brock.

06:08.456 --> 06:10.959
Permanently.

06:17.757 --> 06:18.842
Gwen.

06:19.009 --> 06:21.261
Crud, what's she want with us now?

06:21.428 --> 06:23.513
Well, forget it.
She and Brock can attend...

06:23.680 --> 06:25.849
...the Pete's A Disappointment Dance
together.

06:26.016 --> 06:29.144
They sell tickets? Or can anyone
who thinks you're a jerk attend?

06:29.311 --> 06:32.314
Don't push me, Eugene.
I'm not in the mood.

06:32.480 --> 06:34.065
Yeah, yeah. Your aunt's sick.

06:34.232 --> 06:35.609
Poor Puny Parker.

06:35.775 --> 06:38.778
Even Sally feels bad for you.
But not me.

06:38.945 --> 06:42.908
If you're hanging up on the she-geek,
that proves you're a stuck-up egghead.

06:43.074 --> 06:46.703
A guy who can't even see
when his friends are trying to help.

06:48.204 --> 06:50.332
Okay, if Flash Thompson's
making sense...

06:50.498 --> 06:52.542
...something must be seriously wrong.

06:52.709 --> 06:55.378
<i>Why--?
Why did I blow off my friends?</i>

06:55.545 --> 06:57.464
<i>M.J., Liz.</i>

06:57.672 --> 06:59.841
<i>And Gwen,
she's always been there for us.</i>

07:00.008 --> 07:01.259
<i>Since the seventh grade.</i>

07:01.426 --> 07:05.305
<i>And the battle with the Sinister Six,
the one that we slept through.</i>

07:05.472 --> 07:08.224
<i>Or the fact that we asked
Tombstone for a job.</i>

07:08.391 --> 07:10.977
<i>Or the fact that we keep
thinking "we" instead of</i>

07:11.186 --> 07:12.520
<i>It's the Symbiote.</i>

07:12.687 --> 07:14.314
<i>It's changing me.</i>

07:14.481 --> 07:15.690
<i>It's taking over my life.</i>

07:15.857 --> 07:17.984
I have to get it off.

07:18.193 --> 07:20.153
<i>Stop, Pete, come on.</i>

07:20.320 --> 07:21.363
<i>You're overreacting.</i>

07:21.529 --> 07:24.491
<i>The suit, the Symbiote,
it's made life better.</i>

07:24.699 --> 07:26.368
<i>And there's no one else we need.</i>

07:26.534 --> 07:28.536
<i>Not M.J., not Gwen.</i>

07:28.703 --> 07:29.829
Not even Aunt May?

07:29.996 --> 07:32.499
Those weren't my thoughts.

07:32.707 --> 07:34.334
<i>Wait. We need each other, stop.</i>

07:34.501 --> 07:36.670
No, move your ooze.

07:36.836 --> 07:38.463
<i>We will not allow--</i>

07:45.011 --> 07:47.973
The bell, the vibrations.
You don't like them.

07:51.643 --> 07:55.271
<i>No. We do not like the vibrations.</i>

07:55.438 --> 07:56.898
<i>They are unpleasant.</i>

07:57.065 --> 08:00.235
<i>But not enough to destroy our bond.</i>

08:00.402 --> 08:02.362
We'll see about that.

08:02.529 --> 08:04.364
Hey, I can't move.

08:07.242 --> 08:10.120
<i>In anger, you sought to hurt us.</i>

08:10.286 --> 08:13.164
<i>Instead, you've made us stronger.</i>

08:13.331 --> 08:15.041
<i>We shall demonstrate.</i>

08:16.668 --> 08:18.586
No. What's happening?

08:18.753 --> 08:20.380
Stop. Please.

08:20.547 --> 08:22.215
Stop!

08:22.382 --> 08:24.467
Where am I? What's going on?

08:24.634 --> 08:27.470
What's going on
is you're late for school, kiddo.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.097
And we can't have that.

08:31.307 --> 08:33.351
Uncle Ben?

08:38.523 --> 08:39.649
Uncle Ben.

08:41.693 --> 08:44.612
Haven't had a hug like this
since you were 12.

08:44.779 --> 08:46.531
But you still need to hustle, kiddo.

08:46.698 --> 08:49.951
Don't wanna miss today's field trip.
It's all you've talked about.

08:50.118 --> 08:52.746
A field trip?
Who cares about a field trip?

08:52.912 --> 08:55.373
Uncle Ben, you're here.
You're all right.

08:55.540 --> 08:56.791
I'm fine, Peter.

08:56.958 --> 08:59.294
I've gotta get you out
so I can get to work.

08:59.461 --> 09:00.795
Forget work.

09:00.962 --> 09:03.465
You don't know
how much I've missed you.

09:03.631 --> 09:06.301
- Is he still here?
- He's here, Aunt May.

09:06.468 --> 09:07.469
Uncle Ben's back.

09:07.677 --> 09:09.387
I was talking about you, Peter.

09:09.554 --> 09:11.639
He's in a funny mood today, this one.

09:11.806 --> 09:14.726
Funny mood? Try great mood.
You're back.

09:14.893 --> 09:16.478
We're a family again.

09:16.686 --> 09:19.230
Can't we--?
Can't we just sit for a second?

09:19.397 --> 09:21.316
There's so much
I need to tell you both.

09:21.483 --> 09:23.401
And you can tell us later, kiddo.

09:23.568 --> 09:26.905
Wait. Don't-- Don't go.

09:27.072 --> 09:28.490
Isn't this exciting?

09:28.698 --> 09:31.659
Sure. If you like things
that crawled out from under a rock.

09:31.826 --> 09:34.412
Or if you are one.

09:37.165 --> 09:38.792
<i>The field trip.</i>

09:38.958 --> 09:40.335
<i>The field trip.</i>

09:40.502 --> 09:44.339
And over here,
we have ESU's collection of spiders.

09:44.506 --> 09:45.840
All genetically altered...

09:46.007 --> 09:48.843
...to combine
the most impressive traits...

09:49.010 --> 09:52.806
...into 15 super-spiders.

09:52.972 --> 09:55.517
There are only 14. One's missing.

09:56.684 --> 09:59.687
My husband must have removed it
for further study.

09:59.854 --> 10:01.523
<i>It's happening all over again.</i>

10:01.731 --> 10:03.274
<i>This time I'll stop it.</i>

10:03.441 --> 10:05.276
<i>This time I have to stop it.</i>

10:05.443 --> 10:09.697
<i>Everything can go back to the way it's
supposed to. And Uncle Ben will be--</i>

10:09.864 --> 10:11.324
<i>Not again.</i>

10:11.491 --> 10:14.244
<i>Not again!</i>

10:15.662 --> 10:16.788
What's happening to me?

10:27.048 --> 10:29.551
<i>I feel different.</i>

10:45.525 --> 10:48.486
<i>I'm sticking.</i>

10:48.653 --> 10:50.864
<i>And I'm climbing.</i>

10:51.030 --> 10:53.158
<i>But human beings can't do all this.</i>

10:53.324 --> 10:55.034
<i>We can't.</i>

11:01.332 --> 11:03.585
<i>Okay, we have to stay calm.</i>

11:03.793 --> 11:04.836
<i>This'll work.</i>

11:05.003 --> 11:06.087
<i>It's gotta.</i>

11:07.338 --> 11:09.382
<i>This rocks.</i>

11:09.549 --> 11:12.719
I mean, imagine what we can
do with this-- This power.

11:12.886 --> 11:17.098
Who dares test their skill,
their strength, their stamina...

11:17.265 --> 11:20.935
...against the Venue's
own undefeated legend...

11:21.102 --> 11:26.274
...Crusher Hogan?

11:28.860 --> 11:31.112
I dare. The Spider-Man dares.

11:31.321 --> 11:32.363
You sure, kid?

11:32.530 --> 11:33.573
I like the gimmick...

11:33.740 --> 11:36.784
...but it's worthless
if Crusher crushes you.

11:38.036 --> 11:39.370
A thousand bucks if I win?

11:39.537 --> 11:44.709
- There are caveats but, yeah.
- Then I'm in.

11:44.876 --> 11:47.962
Ladies and gentlemen...

11:48.129 --> 11:52.800
...the Spectacular Spider-Man!

11:53.843 --> 11:56.721
Okay, I'm ready.

11:56.888 --> 11:59.140
I don't like picking on little guys...

11:59.349 --> 12:01.559
...so I'm gonna make this quick,
okay?

12:01.726 --> 12:03.895
Thanks, Crush. But I'm good.

12:04.062 --> 12:05.730
In fact, I'm very good.

12:05.897 --> 12:07.899
One might even say great.

12:08.066 --> 12:09.734
Hey, where'd he go?

12:09.901 --> 12:12.153
- Yoo-hoo!
- Get down here.

12:12.320 --> 12:13.488
That's one option.

12:14.489 --> 12:16.115
Hey. What is this?

12:18.576 --> 12:20.745
- Why, I ought to...
- You're welcome to try...

12:20.912 --> 12:25.083
...but I think you'll find
the match is already over.

12:25.250 --> 12:26.793
Ladies and gentlemen...

12:26.960 --> 12:31.881
...the Spectacular Spider-Man.

12:34.968 --> 12:36.469
Got your money in my safe, kid.

12:36.636 --> 12:38.972
All you gotta do is sign
an exclusive contract...

12:39.138 --> 12:41.516
...with Sullivan Edwards, i.e. me.

12:41.683 --> 12:43.685
Whoa, whoa, I'm not signing anything.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.187
Hey, no signature, no cash.

12:46.396 --> 12:47.981
I told you there were caveats.

12:48.147 --> 12:51.109
- But that's not fair.
- Fair's not my problem.

12:53.528 --> 12:55.113
Hey. That's my money.

12:55.280 --> 12:58.866
Kid. Spider-Man. Stop him.

13:03.204 --> 13:04.372
Not my problem.

13:08.876 --> 13:11.879
<i>Well, that was a bust.
No money. Not even a ride home.</i>

13:12.046 --> 13:14.632
<i>Uncle Ben said he'd wait
for me at the library...</i>

13:14.799 --> 13:17.552
<i>...but I guess all those cops
wouldn't let him park.</i>

13:22.390 --> 13:24.392
Aunt May, what's wrong?

13:24.559 --> 13:25.893
Oh, Peter.

13:26.060 --> 13:28.479
It's Ben.

13:40.742 --> 13:42.744
You stole the life of a good man...

13:42.952 --> 13:44.871
...a man with a loving family...

13:45.038 --> 13:46.914
...and you did it for his lousy car.

13:50.877 --> 13:53.463
Don't bother running.
There's no place you can hide.

13:54.380 --> 13:55.882
Hey-

14:05.475 --> 14:06.768
That face.

14:07.685 --> 14:11.522
<i>Not my problem.</i>

14:12.982 --> 14:14.108
<i>What have I done?</i>

14:14.275 --> 14:16.235
<i>Why blame yourself?</i>

14:25.578 --> 14:26.913
We didn't hurt Uncle Ben.

14:27.288 --> 14:29.415
The world took him away from us.

14:29.582 --> 14:31.793
The world takes everything we love.

14:32.001 --> 14:34.754
There's no one you can trust,
Peter Parker.

14:34.921 --> 14:37.507
No one except us.

14:37.924 --> 14:39.425
Join with us.

14:39.592 --> 14:41.135
Make our bond permanent.

14:41.302 --> 14:43.221
Together, nothing can stop us...

14:43.388 --> 14:47.475
...and everything we ever wanted
will be ours.

15:02.615 --> 15:04.784
- Hold up there, kiddo.
- Uncle Ben.

15:07.453 --> 15:09.330
We don't need you anymore, old man.

15:09.497 --> 15:11.999
Too bad. You stirred up my memory.

15:12.166 --> 15:13.835
Now you're stuck with me.

15:14.001 --> 15:15.795
Wait. Stop.

15:15.962 --> 15:17.839
Well, kiddo, we're here.

15:18.005 --> 15:19.590
- Here?
- The library.

15:19.757 --> 15:21.300
The one across from the Venue.

15:21.467 --> 15:24.679
- You said you had to study here.
- Right. Right.

15:24.846 --> 15:27.056
Uncle Ben,
if you could do something...

15:27.223 --> 15:29.267
...and do it better than anyone else...

15:29.475 --> 15:33.855
...then it wouldn't be wrong to, you
know, cash in on your talents, right?

15:34.021 --> 15:38.401
Well, son, that would depend on
what talents we're talking about.

15:41.988 --> 15:43.281
Listen, kiddo...

15:43.489 --> 15:46.451
...I went through exactly
the same thing at your age.

15:46.617 --> 15:48.453
No, not exactly.

15:48.619 --> 15:52.957
Point is, you're changing
into the man you're going to be.

15:53.124 --> 15:55.376
And just because
you can do something...

15:55.543 --> 15:57.128
...doesn't mean you should.

15:57.295 --> 16:02.717
With great power there must also come
great responsibility.

16:03.551 --> 16:05.136
Pretty words.

16:05.303 --> 16:06.679
But what good did they do?

16:06.846 --> 16:09.849
We still went to the Venue.
We still let the cat burglar go.

16:10.016 --> 16:13.644
He came down to take this car
and took Ben away from us.

16:13.811 --> 16:14.937
From him.

16:15.104 --> 16:16.439
Not you.

16:16.606 --> 16:18.107
But that's not the point.

16:18.274 --> 16:20.526
And I'll prove it.

16:22.111 --> 16:24.780
No. It can't be you. It can't.

16:26.032 --> 16:27.366
This proves your point?

16:27.533 --> 16:28.618
Wait.

16:28.784 --> 16:30.912
Watch him take his vengeance.

16:32.205 --> 16:33.456
No!

16:33.623 --> 16:37.084
I should drop you,
take what you took from Ben Parker.

16:41.964 --> 16:43.466
But he wouldn't approve.

16:43.633 --> 16:47.845
With great power
comes great responsibility.

16:53.976 --> 16:56.938
And that, kiddo,
was only the beginning.

17:11.911 --> 17:14.247
No one's denying
the great work we've done.

17:14.413 --> 17:15.705
But how were we repaid?

17:15.873 --> 17:19.001
We have no money, no girl,
no real friends.

17:19.167 --> 17:21.462
None, that is, save us.

17:21.628 --> 17:23.506
I beg to differ.

17:43.025 --> 17:45.778
Uncle Ben's right.
I'm not alone in this.

17:45.945 --> 17:50.032
And I am not giving up who I am
to become one with the ooze.

17:50.199 --> 17:52.535
You cannot reject
what you already are.

17:52.702 --> 17:55.329
Go get them, kiddo.

18:07.008 --> 18:09.677
That's what you're in for.
Sure you don't wanna vacate?

18:09.844 --> 18:13.472
Vacate? Where do you think we are?

18:21.355 --> 18:23.524
<i>We have taken root in Peter Parker.</i>

18:23.691 --> 18:26.944
Mind, body and soul.

18:27.153 --> 18:28.696
Why bother struggling?

18:28.863 --> 18:31.949
There's no place you can hide.

18:35.077 --> 18:37.455
Boy's got no need to hide.

18:37.663 --> 18:40.875
- He's stronger than you think.
- I'm stronger than you think.

18:48.007 --> 18:50.926
Now, mud stain, shall we dance?

19:31.717 --> 19:32.843
Thanks, Uncle Ben.

19:33.010 --> 19:34.595
<i>Anytime, kiddo.</i>

19:34.762 --> 19:36.555
I'm always here.

19:39.642 --> 19:42.311
<i>This isn't over. You will be ours.</i>

19:42.478 --> 19:44.063
Don't think so, Symbiote.

19:44.230 --> 19:46.774
I know what you are now,
and what you need.

19:49.985 --> 19:52.405
You feed off of negative emotions.

19:52.571 --> 19:54.573
But right now I'm starving you out.

19:54.740 --> 19:56.158
<i>Stop. Don't do this.</i>

19:56.325 --> 19:58.661
<i>We only want to help you.
Be with you.</i>

19:58.828 --> 20:03.082
Sorry, Symbie. I know this must hurt.
But we're just no good together.

20:03.249 --> 20:05.084
Consider yourself dumped.

20:07.586 --> 20:09.714
I'll clear out my stuff tonight.

20:09.880 --> 20:12.800
The Connors won't get the satisfaction
of seeing me beaten.

20:12.967 --> 20:14.135
Spider-Man?

20:14.301 --> 20:15.386
You brought it back.

20:15.553 --> 20:17.304
The alien. Oh, this is great.

20:17.471 --> 20:19.098
Now I can get my job back and--

20:19.265 --> 20:22.393
Wait. What are you doing?
You can't set the temperature that low.

20:22.560 --> 20:24.770
- You'll destroy it.
- That's the general idea.

20:27.648 --> 20:29.400
No. Let go.

20:29.567 --> 20:34.697
- Sorry, if you knew how dangerous...
- No.

20:37.783 --> 20:40.661
Do you know what you've done?

20:40.828 --> 20:43.706
You've destroyed my last chance.

20:45.958 --> 20:50.880
He's supposed to be a hero,
but he's as bad as Pete. Worse.

20:51.046 --> 20:53.799
The two of them pretending
to be Boy Scouts.

20:53.966 --> 20:56.802
When all they do is destroy
anyone and anything...

20:56.969 --> 21:01.390
...that gets in their way.

21:01.557 --> 21:03.976
You-- You're alive.

21:04.143 --> 21:07.855
And you're calling to me.

21:16.363 --> 21:22.244
<i>Eddie Brock, we sense your fury,
your hatred.</i>

21:22.411 --> 21:25.247
<i>And its taste is sweet.</i>

21:25.414 --> 21:28.167
<i>Do you hate the Spider?</i>

21:28.334 --> 21:30.920
<i>Do you hate Parker?</i>

21:31.086 --> 21:32.421
You have to ask?

21:32.588 --> 21:34.215
<i>No.</i>

21:34.381 --> 21:37.468
<i>But we have much to show.</i>

21:54.151 --> 21:56.987
Pete is Spider-Man.

21:57.154 --> 21:59.156
Why didn't I see it before?

21:59.365 --> 22:02.743
I don't have two enemies, I have one.

22:02.910 --> 22:05.037
<i>We have one enemy.</i>

22:05.204 --> 22:09.542
<i>The Spider-Parker
sought to destroy us too.</i>

22:09.708 --> 22:12.837
<i>Bond with us, Eddie Brock.</i>

22:13.003 --> 22:17.424
<i>- Mind, body and soul.
- Yes.</i>

22:17.591 --> 22:21.595
<i>- Accept the gift the Parker rejected.
- Yes.</i>

22:21.762 --> 22:25.015
<i>And together we will have our desire.</i>

22:25.182 --> 22:27.893
Yes.

22:28.060 --> 22:34.441
We will have vengeance
on Spider-Man!
