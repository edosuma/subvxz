02:00.162 --> 02:04.499
Go ahead and lift that up.

02:04.499 --> 02:08.712
That is 5 inches of 1‐inch
round stock 10‐series steel

02:08.712 --> 02:10.422
from which you must make
a signature blade

02:10.422 --> 02:13.634
in your signature style between
8 and 10 inches in length,

02:13.634 --> 02:15.677

<i>a recurve edge.</i>

02:15.677 --> 02:18.555
However, I'm not sure
if that bar of round stock

02:18.555 --> 02:21.350
is enough steel to make
that 8‐ to 10‐inch blade,

02:21.350 --> 02:23.977

a San Mai technique

02:23.977 --> 02:27.189

from‐‐look behind you,

02:27.189 --> 02:31.276

<i>Who tears apart their tools</i>

02:35.530 --> 02:37.115
It just doesn't make sense.

02:37.115 --> 02:39.409
‐ That's right,
you'll cannibalize your forges

02:39.409 --> 02:41.912
in order to make
that San Mai blade.

02:41.912 --> 02:45.666
Don't worry. We'll replace the
forge before you get started.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.293
<i>‐ Forge bodies are made</i>
<i>of very thin, mild steel,</i>

02:48.293 --> 02:49.961

paint on that.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.755
If that's in your weld,
it's just not gonna take,

02:51.755 --> 02:53.882

02:59.471 --> 03:01.014
you'll attach handles
to those blades,

03:01.014 --> 03:03.141
turning them
into fully functional weapons

03:03.141 --> 03:05.977
that we'll test for strength
and durability

03:05.977 --> 03:07.646
<i>in a firebrick chop</i>

03:07.646 --> 03:10.982

and leave The Forge.
Good luck, gentlemen.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.325
Your ten‐minute design window
starts now.

03:20.325 --> 03:24.079
You ever make a knife
out of your forge, Ben?

03:24.079 --> 03:27.040
‐ No, but I've made
a couple forges.

03:27.040 --> 03:28.708
‐ All right,
so the San Mai technique

03:28.708 --> 03:31.420
is a Japanese style
of knife making

03:31.420 --> 03:34.172
that literally means
"three layers,"

03:34.172 --> 03:36.967
so we're looking for these guys
to pull two layers

03:36.967 --> 03:38.677
of mild steel off of the forge

03:38.677 --> 03:42.806
and combine that with that
bar stock of 10‐series steel.

03:42.806 --> 03:44.599
<i>‐ The main challenge</i>
<i>using the forge is,</i>

03:44.599 --> 03:46.435
the metal in the body
is so thin.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.395
You're gonna have to layer
it up to get enough material

03:48.395 --> 03:49.855
to actually make a blade.

03:49.855 --> 03:52.149
<i>What I'm gonna make</i>
<i>is something along the lines</i>

03:52.149 --> 03:54.568
<i>of a camp knife with</i>
<i>a pretty simple recurve edge,</i>

03:54.568 --> 03:56.278
a good no‐nonsense blade.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.904
<i>So I'm gonna take</i>
<i>this design time</i>

03:57.904 --> 03:59.656

<i>for the shape of the blade</i>

03:59.656 --> 04:02.451

<i>things I don't want to forget,</i>

04:02.451 --> 04:04.035
<i>like the blade parameters.</i>

04:04.035 --> 04:05.662
You know, it'd be a shame
to get sent home

04:05.662 --> 04:07.205
for something so avoidable.

04:07.205 --> 04:08.999
I can do that.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.751
‐ I decided to design a knife
similar to a kukri.

04:11.751 --> 04:15.297
<i>It has the recurve edge that</i>
<i>the judges are looking for,</i>

04:15.297 --> 04:18.008
<i>and I give it a slight</i>
<i>forward curve from the tang</i>

04:18.008 --> 04:19.384
<i>all the way to the tip</i>

04:19.384 --> 04:21.595
that I think will do well
in the tests.

04:21.595 --> 04:23.346
<i>I think I'm gonna win</i>
<i>this competition</i>

04:23.346 --> 04:25.807
<i>because I've practiced</i>
<i>this craft quite a bit</i>

04:25.807 --> 04:28.602
<i>and I'm not closed off to</i>
<i>certain styles or techniques</i>

04:28.602 --> 04:30.729
and I'm gonna give the judges
what they asked for.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.856
‐ One of the big things
that they have to definitely do

04:32.856 --> 04:35.192
when they get their mild steel
from that forge

04:35.192 --> 04:36.943
is clean it up
because a lot of that‐‐

04:36.943 --> 04:39.070
they have this
heat‐resistant paint on them.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.947
‐ Heat paint
makes terrible flux.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.325
‐ So I have no idea what
you call this style of blade.

04:43.325 --> 04:45.410
<i>The test is chopping</i>
<i>and slicing,</i>

04:45.410 --> 04:47.412
<i>so I just want to get</i>
<i>enough beef in the front</i>

04:47.412 --> 04:48.830
<i>and make it rigid enough</i>

04:48.830 --> 04:51.082
<i>to stand up to the chopping</i>
<i>and the slicing.</i>

04:51.082 --> 04:53.835
<i>My strength</i>
<i>for bladesmithing is,</i>

04:53.835 --> 04:55.587
<i>I'll see options and avenues,</i>

04:55.587 --> 04:58.381
and that kind of helps me,
one, break away from the pack

04:58.381 --> 04:59.883
with a lot of things
that I'm doing,

04:59.883 --> 05:02.010

center and be focused

05:04.930 --> 05:06.389
<i>‐ This is gonna be</i>
<i>a tough challenge</i>

05:06.389 --> 05:08.308
