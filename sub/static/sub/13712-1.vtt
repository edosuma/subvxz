04:17.798 --> 04:21.220
<i>Welcome to Gattaca.</i>

05:19.820 --> 05:23.490
You keep your workstation so clean.

05:24.491 --> 05:29.955
<i>- It's next to godliness.
- Godliness ...</i>

05:30.122 --> 05:34.918
I reviewed your flight plan. Not
one error in a million keystrokes.

05:35.085 --> 05:40.299
Phenomenal. It's right that someone
like you is taking us to Titan.

05:40.507 --> 05:45.179
Has the committee approved the
mission? There's talk of delay.

05:45.345 --> 05:50.392
You shouldn't listen to talk.
You leave in a week.

05:50.601 --> 05:54.855
You've got a substance test.

06:23.300 --> 06:29.556
<i>If you have to take a substance
test, report to the testing centre.</i>

06:37.231 --> 06:42.027
Jerome. Never shy.
Pisses on command.

06:42.236 --> 06:46.949
- A beautiful piece of equipment.
- You tell me every time I'm here.

06:47.115 --> 06:54.748
I see a great many in my job.
Yours happens to be exceptional.

06:55.916 --> 07:00.879
Why didn't my folks
order one like that for me?

07:15.811 --> 07:19.940
- Have I ever told you about my son?
- No.

07:20.107 --> 07:23.443
Remind me to, sometime.

07:23.610 --> 07:28.740
So you're about to go up.
One week left.

07:28.949 --> 07:33.453
Please tell me
you're the least bit excited.

07:34.371 --> 07:38.876
I'll tell you
at the end of the week.

07:48.927 --> 07:52.347
Congratulations, Jerome.

07:53.599 --> 07:56.643
Thank you.

07:57.978 --> 08:03.108
How many launches are there
in a day? A dozen?

08:03.275 --> 08:10.240
- Sometimes more.
- Only you watch every one of them.

08:13.285 --> 08:18.499
If you're going to pretend
like you don't care, don't look up.

08:20.042 --> 08:21.710
<i>The most unremarkable of events.</i>

08:23.003 --> 08:26.924
<i>Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1 st Class,
is about to embark -</i>

08:27.132 --> 08:33.179
<i>- on a one-year manned mission
to Titan, the 14th moon of Saturn.</i>

08:33.347 --> 08:39.269
<i>This highly prestigious assignment
was guaranteed Jerome at birth.</i>

08:40.604 --> 08:47.611
<i>He has all the gifts required.
A genetic quotient second to none.</i>

08:47.778 --> 08:53.242
<i>There's nothing remarkable about
the progress of Jerome Morrow.</i>

08:53.408 --> 08:57.162
<i>Except that I am not Jerome Morrow.</i>

09:05.546 --> 09:10.592
<i>I was conceived in the Riviera.
Not the French Riviera.</i>

09:10.759 --> 09:13.887
<i>The Detroit variety.</i>

09:14.054 --> 09:20.060
<i>They used to say that a love child
has a greater chance of happiness.</i>

09:20.227 --> 09:23.438
<i>They don't say that any more.</i>

09:24.857 --> 09:28.694
<i>I don't know
why my mother trusted God -</i>

09:28.861 --> 09:31.989
<i>- rather than her local geneticist.</i>

09:34.575 --> 09:39.538
<i>Ten fingers, ten toes, that's all
that used to matter... Not now.</i>

09:39.705 --> 09:46.211
<i>Only seconds old, the ex act time
and cause of my death was known.</i>

09:50.465 --> 09:56.096
Neurological condition, 60%,
manic depression, 42% probability.

09:56.263 --> 10:01.059
<i>Attention deficit disorder,
89% probability. Heart disorder ...</i>

10:03.437 --> 10:07.482
<i>... 99% probability.
Early fatal potential.</i>

10:07.649 --> 10:14.072
- Life expectancy: 30.2 years.
- 30 years?

10:15.240 --> 10:20.621
<i>- The name for the certificate?
- Vincent Anton.</i>

10:22.998 --> 10:25.876
That's a good name.

10:29.004 --> 10:33.467
I know he'll do something.
You'll do something.

10:38.222 --> 10:43.185
<i>I quickly thought of myself
as others did. Chronically ill.</i>

10:43.352 --> 10:47.481
<i>Every skinned knee and runny nose
was treated as a fatal threat.</i>

10:47.648 --> 10:54.780
<i>The insurance won't cover it. If he
fell ... There's nothing I can do.</i>

11:04.289 --> 11:08.418
<i>Like most other parents then,
they wanted their next child -</i>

11:08.585 --> 11:13.382
<i>- to be conceived in what
has become the natural way.</i>

11:13.590 --> 11:17.678
Your extracted eggs, Marie, -

11:17.845 --> 11:22.641
- have been fertilized
with Antonio's sperm.

11:22.850 --> 11:28.605
We have screened two healthy boys
and two very healthy girls.

11:28.772 --> 11:33.277
Without predispositions
to any inheritable diseases.

11:33.443 --> 11:41.076
Let's select the most compatible
candidate. What gender do you want?

11:41.243 --> 11:47.499
We would want Vincent
to have a brother to play with.

11:50.544 --> 11:56.133
<i>You have specified hazel eyes,
dark hair and ... fair skin.</i>

11:56.300 --> 11:59.970
I've eradicated
prejudicial conditions:

12:00.137 --> 12:06.894
Premature baldness, alcoholism,
propensity for violence, obesity.

12:07.060 --> 12:11.064
<i>We didn't want ...
Diseases, yes, but ...</i>

12:11.231 --> 12:15.235
We would like to leave
a few things to chance.

12:15.402 --> 12:21.325
Give your child the best start. We
have enough imperfection built-in.

12:21.491 --> 12:27.498
Your child doesn't need any
additional burdens. It's still you.

12:27.706 --> 12:30.751
Simply the best of you.

12:30.918 --> 12:35.797
You could conceive naturally 1,000
times and never get such a result.

12:37.257 --> 12:44.181
<i>That's how Anton came to be.
A son worthy of my father's name.</i>

12:55.817 --> 13:01.907
- I'm proud of you, son.
- See how much he's grown.

13:15.462 --> 13:18.215
<i>When we played blood brothers -</i>

13:18.382 --> 13:22.302
<i>- I understood my blood was
very different from Anton's.</i>

13:22.511 --> 13:28.559
<i>I'd need a lot more than a drop
if I was going to get anywhere.</i>

13:48.162 --> 13:52.082
<i>We played chicken.
When our parents weren't watching -</i>

13:52.291 --> 13:58.380
<i>- we'd swim as far out as we dared
and see who'd turn back first.</i>

14:12.644 --> 14:15.772
Come on, you coward!

14:16.857 --> 14:19.860
<i>Of course it was always me.</i>

14:20.027 --> 14:25.616
<i>Anton was the stronger swimmer
and had no excuse to fail.</i>

14:28.577 --> 14:33.624
300 million,
350 million, 400 million.

14:33.832 --> 14:38.962
<i>Maybe it was my love of the planets
or just my dislike for this one, -</i>

14:39.171 --> 14:44.384
<i>- but for as long as I remember
I've dreamed of going into space.</i>

14:44.593 --> 14:50.307
750 million,
800 million, 850 million.

14:50.474 --> 14:56.480
How many astronauts are there?
I bet I could be one if I wanted.

14:56.647 --> 14:59.900
Don't eat that. It's Pluto.

15:02.778 --> 15:09.785
<i>My goals didn't change a lot.
Much to my parents' dismay.</i>

15:09.952 --> 15:13.205
<i>Vincent ...</i>

15:17.334 --> 15:21.713
<i>Be realistic. With
a heart condition like yours ...</i>

15:21.880 --> 15:28.595
- There's a chance my heart's fine.
- One chance in 100.

15:28.762 --> 15:33.725
- I'll take it.
- They won't.

15:33.892 --> 15:38.522
You've got to understand something.

15:43.110 --> 15:46.613
You'll only get inside a spaceship
to clean it.

15:46.780 --> 15:54.997
<i>He was right. I lied on my resume,
but my real resume was my cells.</i>

15:55.164 --> 15:58.750
<i>Why waste money on training me -</i>

15:58.917 --> 16:03.338
<i>- when there are 1, 000 other
applicants with a cleaner profile?</i>

16:03.505 --> 16:07.968
<i>It is illegal to discriminate.
"Genoism", it's called.</i>

16:08.135 --> 16:11.013
<i>But no one takes the law seriously.</i>

16:18.061 --> 16:23.108
<i>If you refuse to tell, they take
a sample from a door handle -</i>

16:23.317 --> 16:28.989
<i>- or a handshake. Even the saliva
on your application form.</i>

16:29.156 --> 16:32.576
<i>A legal drug test can become-</i>

16:32.784 --> 16:38.874
<i>- an illegal peek
at your future in the company.</i>

16:44.838 --> 16:49.510
Sure you want to do this?
You know you're going to lose.

16:58.810 --> 17:03.357
<i>It was the last time we swam
together. Out into the open sea.</i>

17:03.524 --> 17:10.113
<i>Knowing each stroke out was one
we'd have to make back.</i>

17:22.876 --> 17:28.089
<i>But something was different. Every
time Anton tried to pull away -</i>

17:28.298 --> 17:32.386
<i>- he found me right beside him.</i>

17:34.054 --> 17:38.100
<i>Until finally
the impossible happened.</i>

17:38.267 --> 17:40.310
Vincent!

17:55.534 --> 18:00.164
<i>For once in our lives Anton was
not as strong as he believed -</i>

18:00.372 --> 18:05.586
<i>- and I was not as weak. That
made everything else possible.</i>

18:49.838 --> 18:55.928
<i>Like others in my situation I moved
around getting work where I could.</i>

18:56.136 --> 19:00.599
<i>I must've cleaned
half the toilets in the state.</i>

19:00.766 --> 19:06.939
<i>The underclass wasn't determined
by social status or skin colour now.</i>

19:07.147 --> 19:13.487
<i>- Welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen.
- Today discrimination is a science.</i>

19:13.654 --> 19:19.243
There's your cleaning material.
Start here and clean to the back.

19:19.409 --> 19:23.163
I want to see my smiling face
on that floor.

19:32.005 --> 19:36.218
Dreaming of space, Your Majesty?

19:36.385 --> 19:39.471
Come here.

19:42.558 --> 19:45.561
Start by cleaning this space.

19:48.480 --> 19:54.653
<i>I knew how far away I was from my
goal when I stood right beside it.</i>

21:07.017 --> 21:11.438
- Don't clean the glass too well.
- What do you mean?

21:11.605 --> 21:14.274
You might get ideas.

21:14.441 --> 21:19.821
But if the glass is clean, it'll be
easier to see me on the other side.

22:10.873 --> 22:16.003
<i>I knew it was just brave talk.
No matter how much I studied, -</i>

22:16.170 --> 22:20.841
<i>- the best test score in the world
needs a blood test to match it.</i>

22:22.801 --> 22:26.805
<i>I had to go to extreme measures.</i>

22:26.972 --> 22:31.685
<i>The man who came didn't exactly
advertise in the Yellow Pages.</i>

22:31.852 --> 22:34.396
Stand straight.

22:35.397 --> 22:39.318
- How did you hear about me?
- People.

22:39.526 --> 22:44.823
Any distinguishing marks?
Tattoos, scars, birth marks?

22:44.990 --> 22:47.534
No.

22:47.701 --> 22:52.372
Are you serious about this?
I hope you're not wasting my time.

22:52.539 --> 22:58.086
- I'd give 100%.
- That'll get you halfway there.

22:58.253 --> 23:04.843
That's an old edition,
but I know it all by heart.

23:07.137 --> 23:12.267
- The commitment is binding.
- You have somebody in mind?

23:33.914 --> 23:39.920
<i>For the genetic elite, success
is attainable, but not guaranteed.</i>

23:40.087 --> 23:44.299
<i>There is no gene for fate.</i>

23:44.466 --> 23:49.763
<i>And when a member of the elite
falls on hard times -</i>

23:49.930 --> 23:54.268
<i>- their genetic identity
becomes a valued commodity.</i>

23:54.434 --> 23:57.312
<i>One man's loss is another's gain.</i>

23:57.479 --> 24:01.233
He's got impeccable credentials.
An unbelievable expiration date.

24:06.947 --> 24:12.077
He'll practically live forever.
His IQ is off the register.

24:12.286 --> 24:18.959
Better than 20/20 vision. Strong
heart. He could run through a wall.

24:23.422 --> 24:27.092
If he could still run.

24:27.301 --> 24:31.388
He was a big-time swimming star.

24:31.555 --> 24:37.978
You could go anywhere with this
guy's DNA tucked under your arm.

24:40.981 --> 24:46.486
- You look so right together.
- We don't look anything alike.

24:46.653 --> 24:52.826
Nobody looks at photos today.
Christ, you could have my face.

24:53.035 --> 24:58.790
- How do I explain the accident?
- It happened out of the country.

24:58.957 --> 25:06.006
No one knows he broke his back. He's
still a fully productive citizen.

25:06.173 --> 25:12.012
- Just fill in his last year.
- You're a foreigner.

25:12.179 --> 25:17.684
They don't care where you were born.
Blood has no nationality.

25:17.851 --> 25:22.439
As long as it's got what they want,
it's the only passport you'll need.

25:23.857 --> 25:29.863
- Who lives up there?
- Well, I certainly don't.

25:30.656 --> 25:34.159
<i>The process of becoming him began.</i>

25:34.326 --> 25:38.705
<i>Myopia is one of the most obvious
signs of a disadvantaged birth.</i>

25:38.872 --> 25:43.627
- Isn't there another way?
- Surgery will leave scars.

25:43.794 --> 25:47.923
It's contact lenses or a white cane.

25:48.090 --> 25:52.719
- Besides, the colour doesn't match.
- He's right.

25:52.886 --> 25:56.723
My eyes are prettier.

25:58.392 --> 26:01.353
I take 25% of all you make.

26:01.520 --> 26:06.567
If it fails, all this equipment
must be returned in seven days.

26:06.733 --> 26:10.904
- And you lose your deposit.
- Wait! You said 20%.

26:11.071 --> 26:14.158
- 20%.
- It's not negotiable.

26:29.798 --> 26:35.679
- I guess that's it.
- No. There's still the height.

26:35.846 --> 26:41.185
How tall were you
before the accident?

26:41.351 --> 26:47.107
- His profile says he's 6' 1 ".
- I can wear lifts.

26:48.775 --> 26:53.739
Even with lifts
you're not that tall.

26:53.947 --> 26:57.284
So what?

27:01.788 --> 27:04.082
<i>No ...</i>

27:07.127 --> 27:11.215
- We never discussed that.
- I thought you were serious.

27:11.381 --> 27:15.511
I am. I'm not doing that.

27:18.847 --> 27:20.807
No.

27:27.314 --> 27:30.234
<i>Now Jerome knew I was committed.</i>

27:30.400 --> 27:35.155
<i>I endured the pain by reminding
myself that when I did stand up -</i>

27:35.322 --> 27:39.493
<i>- I'd be exactly two inches
closer to the stars.</i>

27:39.660 --> 27:47.876
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Do you want to go dancing?

27:49.670 --> 27:55.092
You had to be a right-hander.
No one orders southpaws any more.

27:56.593 --> 28:01.807
Jerome Morrow. It's a nice name.

28:04.017 --> 28:08.021
- It's my name.
- I can't be you without it.

28:08.188 --> 28:12.317
What makes you think
you can be me at all?

28:19.700 --> 28:22.703
Look at this.

28:22.870 --> 28:27.374
- Look at it.
- It's nice.

28:28.625 --> 28:35.799
- Is it real?
- Are you colour-blind? It's silver.

28:35.966 --> 28:41.346
Jerome Morrow was never meant
to be one step down on the podium.

28:41.513 --> 28:48.687
With all I had going for me,
I was still second best.

28:48.854 --> 28:54.401
Me!
So how do you expect to pull it off?

28:57.070 --> 29:00.574
I don't know, exactly.

29:04.161 --> 29:07.206
Your signature needs work.

29:07.372 --> 29:10.250
<i>Soon we were put to the test.</i>

29:10.417 --> 29:17.090
<i>Jerome had the genes to get
into Gattaca, but not the desire.</i>

29:17.257 --> 29:22.679
- Do you really want to be in there?
- Not in there. Up there.

29:25.057 --> 29:30.771
- What's up there?
- That's want I want to see, Jerome.

29:31.772 --> 29:36.735
Call me Eugene. My middle name.

29:37.903 --> 29:41.990
If you're going to be Jerome,
you better start getting used to it.

29:51.625 --> 29:56.129
- I must go. Where's my sample?
- In the fridge. Door on the left.

29:57.714 --> 30:01.802
- Which pouch?
- Any of them.

30:03.846 --> 30:09.142
- You think I should test it?
- If you like.

30:16.275 --> 30:21.155
- What's wrong with the machine?
- You've been drinking again!

30:21.321 --> 30:26.118
- I haven't.
- Christ, it's eight in the morning!

30:33.250 --> 30:38.046
This is no joke.
My interview is in an hour!

30:42.801 --> 30:49.683
- There's more vodka than piss!
- I had half a glass to celebrate.

30:49.850 --> 30:54.521
- Friday's will be all right.
- There's only Wednesday left.

30:54.688 --> 30:58.108
That's the one.

31:08.911 --> 31:13.874
It's not too late to back out.

31:15.876 --> 31:21.298
This is the last day
you will be you and I will be me.

31:23.675 --> 31:26.887
Well?

31:54.289 --> 32:00.254
- Congratulations.
- What about the interview?

32:00.420 --> 32:02.714
That was it.

32:10.889 --> 32:14.017
I got it.

32:14.184 --> 32:17.312
Of course you got it.

32:25.946 --> 32:32.953
<i>Each day I would dispose of
all my loose skin, nails and hair.</i>

32:33.120 --> 32:39.001
<i>To limit how much of my In- Valid
self I'd leave in the Valid world.</i>

32:44.715 --> 32:51.054
<i>Eugene prepared samples of his
body matter so I'd pass for him.</i>

32:51.263 --> 32:54.641
<i>Urine for the substance tests.</i>

32:54.808 --> 33:01.398
<i>Blood for the security checks
and vials filled with other traces.</i>

33:01.607 --> 33:05.736
<i>Eugene gave me his identity
while I paid the rent -</i>

33:05.903 --> 33:10.657
<i>- and kept him in the style
to which he'd become accustomed.</i>

33:10.824 --> 33:17.247
<i>Eugene had never been called
"utero", "faith birth", "In- Valid".</i>

33:17.414 --> 33:24.296
<i>As a "Valid", he suffered
under the burden of perfection.</i>

33:26.465 --> 33:32.179
<i>I was now a member of a new
and detested segment of society.</i>

33:32.346 --> 33:39.186
<i>One of those who won't accept
their fate. A "borrowed ladder".</i>

33:39.353 --> 33:42.689
<i>Or... a "de-gene-erate".</i>

33:48.612 --> 33:53.659
<i>In the guise of Jerome Morrow
I've risen quickly in Gattaca.</i>

33:53.867 --> 33:59.081
<i>Only one of the mission directors
has come close to exposing me.</i>

33:59.248 --> 34:05.838
<i>He may have more success exposing
me in death than he did in life.</i>

34:27.900 --> 34:32.947
I think we can rule out suicide.

34:33.197 --> 34:35.409
Thank you.

34:38.203 --> 34:43.583
This will take a while.
We may have to push things back.

34:55.554 --> 35:00.350
Irene, I want you
to assist the investigators.

35:00.559 --> 35:06.440
- That would put me behind.
- I appreciate your sacrifice.

35:06.607 --> 35:11.570
- I won't lose my place in line?
- Your place is assured.

35:11.778 --> 35:17.117
So kindly inform the authorities
we will cooperate in any way, -

35:17.284 --> 35:21.622
- although we can't tolerate
a major disruption.

35:21.788 --> 35:26.919
- Thank you, Irene.
- Thank you, Director.

35:27.127 --> 35:33.926
- How will this affect the mission?
- We'll go ahead as planned.

35:34.092 --> 35:37.513
The launch can only be this week.

35:37.679 --> 35:45.312
Tragic though this event may be, it
hasn't stopped the planets turning.

35:55.906 --> 36:01.245
- What happened?
- I'm going up.

36:01.411 --> 36:06.834
- End of the week.
- That soon?

36:07.000 --> 36:12.714
- What about the mission director?
- He's dead.

36:15.175 --> 36:17.886
Are you serious?

36:18.053 --> 36:23.851
They found him beaten so badly
they had to check his name tag.

36:24.685 --> 36:27.145
You are serious.

36:27.354 --> 36:33.527
There's nothing
between us and ignition.

36:33.694 --> 36:37.739
I'm going up.

36:37.906 --> 36:40.909
- The man was murdered?
- I didn't do it.

36:41.076 --> 36:47.332
- It'll be crawling with Hoovers.
- I'll handle the J. Edgars.

36:47.499 --> 36:53.380
What if they do find something?
I'll be out of their jurisdiction.

36:57.968 --> 37:00.053
We have to get drunk immediately.

37:07.644 --> 37:13.358
Good evening, gentlemen. I hear
you're leaving us, Mr. Morrow.

37:13.525 --> 37:17.863
- We're going to miss you.
- You've opened the wine, I hope?

37:18.030 --> 37:20.782
Pour yourself a glass, Cavendish.

37:44.431 --> 37:47.518
How old is the specimen?

37:47.684 --> 37:53.941
- I kissed him five minutes ago.
- I'll see what I can do.

37:58.445 --> 38:02.115
- You want the full sequence?
- Yes.

38:03.534 --> 38:05.744
Good luck.

38:22.678 --> 38:29.977
- 9.3. Quite a catch.
- Yes. Quite a catch.

38:56.336 --> 39:02.509
<i>God, I've told Cavendish ... This
has only been open five minutes!</i>

39:02.718 --> 39:05.262
Wine needs to breathe.

39:05.429 --> 39:12.519
They say being weightless is the
closest thing to being in the womb.

39:15.522 --> 39:20.861
I can't believe you pulled this off.
They're sending you up there.

39:21.028 --> 39:23.489
Up there! You, of all people.

39:23.697 --> 39:28.577
You'll be alone
in that room for a year.

39:28.744 --> 39:34.500
- It's bigger than your tin can.
- What are you going to do?

39:34.666 --> 39:38.420
I have my books.
I travel in my head.

39:38.587 --> 39:43.008
I wish you had company.
Someone you didn't have to pay for.

39:43.175 --> 39:48.514
- I wouldn't have it any other way.
- What are you going to do?

39:50.724 --> 39:54.478
I'm going to finish this.

40:05.322 --> 40:09.076
What's Titan like
this time of year?

40:11.078 --> 40:16.708
What's Titan like?
Titan is exactly like this.

40:27.886 --> 40:33.976
The cloud around it is so thick,
no one can tell what's underneath.

40:35.185 --> 40:40.315
- Maybe there's nothing there.
- There's something there.

40:44.820 --> 40:50.284
- You should be going, not me.
- Why is that?

40:51.618 --> 40:56.582
Because up there
your legs wouldn't matter.

41:01.044 --> 41:05.048
I'm scared of heights.

41:23.609 --> 41:26.403
I'm sorry.

41:26.570 --> 41:31.867
Do you want this?
I'll save some for you, shall I?

41:39.958 --> 41:44.838
I'm so sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

41:48.634 --> 41:53.263
Don't give me a hard time.
Give me a break.

41:54.348 --> 42:00.437
- Come on! Help!
- I'm sorry.

42:09.112 --> 42:12.157
<i>I wasn't drunk ...</i>

42:12.324 --> 42:16.620
<i>... when I walked
in front of that car.</i>

42:16.787 --> 42:22.417
I stepped right out in front of it.
I'd never been more sober, ever.

42:25.295 --> 42:29.675
- Go to sleep.
- I couldn't even get that right.

42:29.842 --> 42:34.263
If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again.

42:34.429 --> 42:37.724
Go to sleep.

42:41.436 --> 42:44.565
I'm proud of you, Vincent.

42:47.609 --> 42:51.029
You must be drunk
to call me Vincent.

43:30.694 --> 43:35.449
- How much do you need?
- 20 minutes.

43:54.885 --> 43:57.888
You can go.

44:03.101 --> 44:07.272
It's all right, Irene.
You're excused.

44:29.920 --> 44:34.675
We found our man. It's the only
specimen we can't account for.

44:34.842 --> 44:39.346
- Every 10 years things go our way.
- Tell me about the eyelash.

44:39.513 --> 44:45.060
An unregistered In-Valid. A janitor.
He disappeared a few years back.

44:45.227 --> 44:51.275
- The specimen could be from then.
- Nothing lies around here for long.

44:51.441 --> 44:55.988
Would a janitor come back after so
long to kill a man he never knew?

44:56.155 --> 44:58.365
His profile suggests he's violent.

44:58.574 --> 45:06.999
It also suggests he's a sick man.
There's a 90% chance he's dead.

45:07.166 --> 45:11.295
That leaves a 10% chance
he's still alive.

45:11.461 --> 45:16.925
<i>The owner of the eyelash is the
murderer. I'll do a cross-check ...</i>

45:17.092 --> 45:22.222
- He has no living relatives.
- That's a damn shame, sir.

45:22.389 --> 45:26.143
Check the entry log.
Alibis, grudges.

45:26.351 --> 45:31.815
I see a lot of dry eyes. The mission
director was not universally loved.

45:31.982 --> 45:36.403
He was leading cutbacks
in the programme.

45:36.570 --> 45:39.198
<i>With all due respect, sir ...</i>

45:42.242 --> 45:45.454
Whatever you say.

45:59.843 --> 46:02.596
Jerome the metronome.

46:02.763 --> 46:07.267
I could play the piano
by that heartbeat of his.

46:07.434 --> 46:12.856
- We have a suspect.
- That is a relief. Who is he?

46:13.023 --> 46:17.778
We found an unaccounted-for
specimen. Here's his picture.

46:19.404 --> 46:23.158
- An In-Valid.
- We're still following other leads.

46:23.325 --> 46:28.789
- I'm posting this immediately.
- I'm curious, Director.

46:28.956 --> 46:33.669
An advantage, I should imagine,
in your line of work.

46:33.836 --> 46:38.799
<i>- Your hiring practices ...
- Our "recruitment philosophy".</i>

46:38.966 --> 46:45.722
- Who do you have to be, to be here?
- We don't take common citizens.

46:45.889 --> 46:49.059
Are they all equally excellent?

46:49.226 --> 46:53.981
Occasionally we've had to accept
candidates with minor shortcomings.

46:54.148 --> 47:00.821
But nothing that would stop them
joining the police, for example.

47:00.988 --> 47:07.578
Now, there are enough of the right
kind to warrant a new standard.

47:07.744 --> 47:14.835
Bodies with minds to match.
Essential, as we push out further.

47:15.002 --> 47:20.132
- Yet you still monitor performance.
- To see they meet their potential.

47:20.340 --> 47:24.261
- And exceeding it?
- No one exceeds his potential.

47:24.469 --> 47:30.100
If he did, we just didn't accurately
gauge his potential right off.

47:41.862 --> 47:44.573
- All right?
- Terrific.

48:09.223 --> 48:13.227
The entry log for the past week.

48:14.770 --> 48:19.900
What about you, Irene?
Do you have an alibi?

48:20.108 --> 48:25.239
- I was alone.
- I find that hard to believe.

48:34.581 --> 48:38.585
I'll take care of that
for you, Mr. Morrow.

48:51.139 --> 48:57.020
I see I'm not the only one who looks
up every time there's a launch.

48:59.773 --> 49:05.362
- It's awful about the director.
- Awful it didn't happen sooner.

49:05.529 --> 49:12.494
Didn't he threaten to cancel your
mission? Somebody did you a favour.

49:12.661 --> 49:17.374
- Do they know who I should thank?
- They found an eyelash.

49:17.583 --> 49:22.713
- Does it have a name?
- Just some In-Valid.

49:22.921 --> 49:26.425
<i>Jerome ...</i>

49:27.634 --> 49:32.306
I had you sequenced.
I read your profile.

49:32.472 --> 49:35.809
I'm sorry.

49:37.436 --> 49:42.065
Seems you're everything
they say you are and more.

49:42.232 --> 49:46.695
You're engineered
just like the rest of us.

49:46.862 --> 49:50.199
Not quite.

49:50.365 --> 49:55.162
"Unacceptable likelihood of heart
failure." That's how they put it.

49:55.370 --> 50:00.083
The only trip I'll take in space
is around the sun on this satellite.

50:01.919 --> 50:06.507
If there's anything wrong with you,
I can't see it from where I stand.

50:09.593 --> 50:12.346
<i>If you don't believe me ...</i>

50:14.473 --> 50:17.851
Here. Take it.

50:26.401 --> 50:30.948
If you're still interested,
let me know.

50:32.825 --> 50:36.954
I'm sorry. The wind caught it.

50:57.432 --> 51:01.520
<i>Please check
the latest Gattaca bulletin.</i>

51:10.904 --> 51:17.661
Jerome. Is this
the approach path we discussed?

51:19.246 --> 51:25.752
- Absolutely, Director.
- Quite right.

51:40.184 --> 51:44.771
Listen, I want what I ordered.

51:44.938 --> 51:50.068
It's a completely different colour.
No. I'm bored of talking to you.

51:50.277 --> 51:54.281
I'll call you back.

51:54.448 --> 51:59.119
That was about your hair dye.
They've sent me "Summer Wheat".

51:59.286 --> 52:02.289
It's too light.

52:02.456 --> 52:06.460
"Why don't you try a change?"
We can't use it!

52:07.961 --> 52:12.841
- I'll probably have to pay for it.
- We can't stay here.

52:13.050 --> 52:18.263
<i>- The idiots I have to deal with ...!
- They think I killed the director.</i>

52:20.015 --> 52:24.228
- What makes them think that?
- They found my eyelash.

52:26.063 --> 52:29.149
- Where?
- In the corridor.

52:29.316 --> 52:32.069
Thank God it wasn't in your eye.

52:32.236 --> 52:38.408
My picture is everywhere. I can't
turn around without seeing my face.

52:38.575 --> 52:45.666
<i>- They'll recognize me. They will!
- I don't recognize you.</i>

52:45.833 --> 52:51.839
They won't accept one of their elite
could've suckered them for so long.

52:52.005 --> 52:58.262
No, we do as we planned. You're
Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1 st Class.

52:58.428 --> 53:02.975
I'm not Jerome Morrow.
I'm a murder suspect.

53:03.141 --> 53:08.564
What are you doing?
That's more than a day's worth!

53:08.730 --> 53:14.903
<i>- We can't stay here.
- Stop that! Fine ... fine!</i>

53:15.070 --> 53:20.826
Leave if you want. But don't
take that stuff. It's mine!

53:22.035 --> 53:25.372
I would've chosen a brave partner -

53:25.539 --> 53:30.586
- if I'd known you'd go
belly-up on me at the last gasp.

53:30.752 --> 53:35.299
You can't quit on me now.

53:35.465 --> 53:40.429
Do you want me to wheel in there
and finish the job myself?

53:40.637 --> 53:48.061
<i>- They are going to find me.
- You still don't understand ...</i>

53:51.023 --> 53:57.613
When they look at you, they
don't see you any more. Only me.

54:10.292 --> 54:15.255
Keep your lashes on your lids
where they belong.

54:15.422 --> 54:18.592
How could you be so careless?

54:50.332 --> 54:53.836
- I'm going out.
- Where?

54:54.044 --> 54:57.548
I want some fun before they nail me.

54:57.714 --> 55:03.053
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- You said not to change anything.

55:03.220 --> 55:08.976
- Who's going?
- I'd say everybody.

55:09.142 --> 55:13.397
If I don't go
it'll look suspicious.

55:13.564 --> 55:17.568
You don't want to look suspicious,
do you?

55:20.404 --> 55:22.614
Thanks.

56:21.715 --> 56:26.053
Who ordered this?
What are we doing here?

56:26.220 --> 56:31.016
I'm following a lead. Forgive me,
but I'm a detective. I follow leads.

56:31.225 --> 56:36.897
- Why should the suspect be here?
- He's an In-Valid.

56:37.064 --> 56:41.735
- This is where the In-Valids are.
- He's an In-Valid.

56:41.902 --> 56:48.325
He's been in hiding all these years.
You think he'll lie down for us now?

56:48.492 --> 56:52.246
- What do you suggest?
- Go back to the scene.

56:52.454 --> 56:55.749
Sweep the area around Gattaca.

57:18.856 --> 57:25.279
- You're a navigator? At Gattaca?
- That's what it says, doesn't it?

57:25.445 --> 57:32.828
- It doesn't say you're crippled.
- I hurt my leg training, you moron.

57:34.121 --> 57:40.544
How dare you question me?
What's your number?

57:40.752 --> 57:45.632
- Your number, you fucking flatfoot!
- What do you want? An apology?

57:45.841 --> 57:52.723
It gets to you that I can live your
dreams. I'm leaving this dirtball!

57:52.890 --> 57:57.686
- You're harassing me!
- My mistake.

57:57.853 --> 58:00.647
What's your number?

58:02.232 --> 58:07.279
This is a crime scene.
What's this man doing here?

58:07.488 --> 58:12.451
- What are you doing, old man?
- My job, sir.

58:12.618 --> 58:18.373
- This is evidence.
- But it's just trash.

59:08.757 --> 59:14.638
You didn't know?
Wonderful, wasn't it?

59:15.681 --> 59:19.726
12 fingers or 1, it's how you play.

59:19.893 --> 59:25.023
That piece can only
be played with 12.

59:40.497 --> 59:46.170
- What's all this about?
- It's probably nothing.

01:00:23.874 --> 01:00:30.130
No. I don't want to give you
a contaminated specimen. Get it?

01:00:59.660 --> 01:01:05.082
Thanks. You never know
where those swabs have been.

01:01:06.250 --> 01:01:10.337
I want to show you something.

01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.343
Come on, we'll miss it.

01:02:24.912 --> 01:02:28.499
Come on. We'll miss it.

01:03:14.628 --> 01:03:18.674
What did I tell you?

01:03:37.484 --> 01:03:41.572
Strange. Your eyes look different.

01:03:41.738 --> 01:03:47.119
- I guess it must be the light.
- Must be.

01:04:09.516 --> 01:04:13.562
Positive match. I'm impressed.

01:04:13.729 --> 01:04:19.193
- The cup was used recently?
- Two samples, two days.

01:04:19.359 --> 01:04:24.114
He may have returned to the
crime scene to get a drink of water.

01:04:24.281 --> 01:04:28.577
- Or he may still work there.
- We checked all the service staff.

01:04:28.744 --> 01:04:34.041
I don't think he cleans any more.
I think he's there in disguise.

01:04:34.208 --> 01:04:40.714
- A borrowed ladder at Gattaca?
- Far-fetched, but not impossible.

01:04:40.923 --> 01:04:48.055
He can't be among the elite. He's
mentally and physically inferior.

01:04:48.222 --> 01:04:54.061
Maybe he is an imposter
and maybe the director found out.

01:04:54.228 --> 01:04:57.481
Let's sample every employee
intravenously.

01:04:57.648 --> 01:05:04.488
We'd close them down for days. No,
take a fingertip or a urine sample.

01:05:04.655 --> 01:05:09.451
I suggest blood from the vein.
I hope I'm not out of line.

01:05:37.688 --> 01:05:41.358
It's only a matter of time, sir.

01:05:44.862 --> 01:05:51.785
What's with the plungers, Lamar?
You open up a blood bank?

01:05:51.952 --> 01:05:59.585
The detectives fear my methods
may have been compromised.

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:18.562
- Goddamn! Are you out of practice?
- Let me look at that.

01:06:18.729 --> 01:06:22.900
- It's all right.
- Luckily, we have enough.

01:06:23.066 --> 01:06:28.113
If you need any more,
you can get it off his shoes.

01:06:42.211 --> 01:06:45.339
Irene.

01:06:47.591 --> 01:06:53.847
- So you didn't do it after all?
- I guess someone beat me to it.

01:06:54.056 --> 01:06:57.267
I guess.

01:07:02.523 --> 01:07:05.526
I leave in two days.

01:07:07.694 --> 01:07:11.365
<i>I guess you know that. But ...</i>

01:07:23.877 --> 01:07:26.880
That's the last.

01:07:27.047 --> 01:07:30.259
- Something's wrong.
- He's not here.

01:07:30.425 --> 01:07:37.724
- I say we test again.
- No. No more disruptions.

01:07:37.891 --> 01:07:44.481
- You have a murderer in your midst.
- Your presence is more of a threat.

01:07:44.648 --> 01:07:49.528
The window for our latest launch is
open for seven days every 70 years.

01:07:49.695 --> 01:07:55.868
- It's crucial we leave on time.
- This mission means a lot to you.

01:07:56.076 --> 01:07:59.496
Your late colleague opposed it.

01:07:59.663 --> 01:08:05.460
Take another look at my profile.
I haven't a violent bone in my body.

01:08:05.627 --> 01:08:10.507
My apologies.
He won't trouble you any further.

01:08:10.674 --> 01:08:15.554
This is not the only place
we can look.

01:08:17.890 --> 01:08:21.477
Let's start making the rounds.

01:09:21.995 --> 01:09:26.250
I'm luckier than most.
Not as lucky as some.

01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:34.925
- I know something about that.
- What heart problem have you had?

01:09:35.133 --> 01:09:38.886
Did you get yours broken once?

01:09:41.849 --> 01:09:48.104
I had this crazy idea you were more
interested in the murder than in me.

01:09:49.523 --> 01:09:52.651
You're right.

01:09:54.278 --> 01:09:57.865
That's a crazy idea.

01:09:59.783 --> 01:10:03.203
Would you like to dance?

01:10:38.405 --> 01:10:44.661
<i>It's funny. You work so hard
to get away from a place ...</i>

01:10:45.621 --> 01:10:52.920
And when you finally get to leave,
you find a reason to stay.

01:10:57.841 --> 01:11:03.764
- A year is a long time.
- Not so long.

01:11:03.931 --> 01:11:08.101
Just once around the sun.

01:11:15.651 --> 01:11:21.281
Hello, I'm your detective
for the evening. Please stay here.

01:11:22.658 --> 01:11:27.704
Don't leave! Am I speaking
in some strange foreign language?

01:11:27.871 --> 01:11:33.794
Check lenses, dentures, napkins,
cigarette butts, saliva off cups.

01:11:35.379 --> 01:11:40.008
That's a familiar face.
Check him out.

01:11:43.136 --> 01:11:48.100
- I thought you wanted to dance.
- Where are you going?

01:11:48.642 --> 01:11:51.645
Jerome!

01:12:00.487 --> 01:12:04.074
- Are you insane?
- Come on!

01:12:21.508 --> 01:12:23.510
Where did they go?

01:12:29.516 --> 01:12:32.519
Come on.

01:12:43.071 --> 01:12:46.658
- I can't do that!
- You just did.

01:12:47.534 --> 01:12:52.748
Don't touch your face.
Don't swallow. Clean his teeth.

01:12:56.752 --> 01:12:59.213
Vincent!

01:13:02.716 --> 01:13:06.136
Vincent!

01:13:11.266 --> 01:13:14.353
Who's Vincent?

01:13:18.524 --> 01:13:21.151
<i>I ...</i>

01:13:24.571 --> 01:13:27.908
Don't say anything.

01:13:28.075 --> 01:13:31.328
Don't say anything.

01:16:23.375 --> 01:16:26.253
What happened?

01:16:28.630 --> 01:16:32.551
The scars on your legs?

01:16:34.970 --> 01:16:38.557
Remember the '99 Chrysler LeBaron?

01:16:38.724 --> 01:16:44.897
I bumped into the front fender.
Looked left instead of right.

01:16:48.442 --> 01:16:54.198
- Is that the new or the old excuse?
- The old one.

01:16:55.782 --> 01:17:00.746
- You are involved with the murder.
- That's not true, Irene.

01:17:10.088 --> 01:17:13.759
Isn't that the man from last night?

01:17:14.843 --> 01:17:16.970
He's nobody.

01:17:26.939 --> 01:17:34.112
He's one of our best. He has nothing
to do with this business.

01:17:35.405 --> 01:17:38.325
Jerome Morrow.

01:17:46.458 --> 01:17:52.256
You don't look well, Jerome.
Why don't you go home?

01:18:02.808 --> 01:18:05.686
- Yes?
- Jerome Morrow.

01:18:05.853 --> 01:18:11.066
He's ill. A little nausea.
It's quite common before a mission.

01:18:11.275 --> 01:18:16.864
I want to visit him. I understand
you can show me the way.

01:19:00.324 --> 01:19:04.328
You don't know who he is, do you?

01:19:21.428 --> 01:19:25.349
- Hello?
- Be yourself today.

01:19:25.557 --> 01:19:30.979
- I was never very good at it.
- Tell the investigators you're ill.

01:19:31.146 --> 01:19:35.609
<i>- How long have I got?
- Not long.</i>

01:21:24.343 --> 01:21:27.846
I guess he's not home.

01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:34.603
- I'm here to see Jerome Morrow.
- That's me. Come up.

01:21:34.770 --> 01:21:38.524
I guess he's home.

01:22:12.432 --> 01:22:14.351
Come in.

01:22:14.351 --> 01:22:16.353
Come in.

01:22:16.520 --> 01:22:20.274
Come in.

01:22:20.482 --> 01:22:23.735
Hello, sweetheart.

01:22:24.987 --> 01:22:28.907
Where's my kiss?

01:22:29.992 --> 01:22:37.708
- Good to see you're feeling better.
- Of course, now that you're here.

01:22:46.216 --> 01:22:51.096
Who's your friend? How can I help?

01:22:51.263 --> 01:22:55.309
- It's about the director.
- Again?

01:22:55.476 --> 01:22:59.146
- I hope it's no trouble.
- No, no.

01:22:59.313 --> 01:23:03.567
- I won't show you around. Sorry.
- Can't we do this another time?

01:23:03.734 --> 01:23:09.990
- This won't take a moment.
- Maybe he can tell me why I'm ill.

01:23:45.651 --> 01:23:49.738
Who were you expecting?

01:24:31.405 --> 01:24:37.327
<i>- We have our man in custody.
- I'll come right away.</i>

01:24:59.975 --> 01:25:05.564
- How are you, Jerome?
- Not bad, Jerome.

01:25:07.024 --> 01:25:12.446
- How the hell did you get up here?
- I can walk. I've been faking it.

01:25:29.004 --> 01:25:31.965
<i>Irene ...</i>

01:25:32.132 --> 01:25:35.803
Don't touch me!
I don't even know who you are.

01:25:35.969 --> 01:25:41.099
- I'm the same as I was yesterday.
- No more lies, Jerome.

01:25:41.308 --> 01:25:45.145
My name is Vincent Anton Freeman.

01:25:45.312 --> 01:25:51.318
I'm a faith birth or a de-gene-erate
or whatever. But I'm not a murderer.

01:25:52.986 --> 01:25:58.742
- You're a God-child?
- We do have one thing in common.

01:25:58.909 --> 01:26:04.498
Only I don't have 20-30 years left
in mine. It's 10,000 beats overdue.

01:26:04.665 --> 01:26:10.003
- It's not possible.
- You know what isn't possible.

01:26:10.170 --> 01:26:13.841
Don't you, Irene?

01:26:14.049 --> 01:26:19.346
They've got you looking so hard for
any flaw, that that's all you see.

01:26:22.474 --> 01:26:27.813
For whatever it's worth, I'm here
to tell you that it is possible.

01:26:28.939 --> 01:26:32.693
It is possible.

01:27:09.897 --> 01:27:16.862
Congratulations, sir. His spit was
found in the dead director's eye.

01:27:17.029 --> 01:27:23.368
While I obsessed over an eyelash,
your instincts pointed the way.

01:27:23.577 --> 01:27:26.788
So the In-Valid wasn't involved?

01:27:26.955 --> 01:27:32.085
No, our friend acted alone. This
mission meant everything to him.

01:27:35.631 --> 01:27:39.551
He'll only live to see this launch.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:45.474
Since nothing can stop the launch
now, he's very, very cooperative.

01:27:48.727 --> 01:27:55.442
- So, will you celebrate tonight?
- Of course.

01:28:11.458 --> 01:28:18.298
- I think she likes us.
- In time she'll get used to it.

01:28:18.465 --> 01:28:22.136
- What was he like?
- Just a cop.

01:28:22.302 --> 01:28:25.472
- Did you get his name?
- No.

01:28:25.639 --> 01:28:29.560
- He'll be back.
- They have their man. It's over.

01:28:29.726 --> 01:28:33.230
No, it's not. I have to meet him.

01:29:00.507 --> 01:29:03.177
Vincent?

01:29:12.019 --> 01:29:15.439
My God, you have changed.

01:29:17.691 --> 01:29:22.488
- Don't you recognize your brother?
- Are we brothers?

01:29:22.696 --> 01:29:28.702
Our parents died thinking they'd
outlived you. I had my doubts.

01:29:29.661 --> 01:29:35.042
<i>- What are you doing here?
- I have a right to be here.</i>

01:29:36.001 --> 01:29:42.007
- You don't.
- You sound as if you believe that.

01:29:42.174 --> 01:29:46.887
I committed no murder.
You must be disappointed.

01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:54.102
You committed fraud. You're in
trouble. I can get you out of here.

01:29:54.311 --> 01:29:59.817
- I've struggled to get here!
- You've gone as far as you can go.

01:30:00.818 --> 01:30:03.987
There's still a million miles to go.

01:30:04.154 --> 01:30:07.741
Can you only succeed
by seeing me fail?

01:30:07.908 --> 01:30:13.580
God! Even you are going to tell me
what I can and can't do now?

01:30:13.747 --> 01:30:20.337
I don't need any rescuing.
But you did, once.

01:30:22.422 --> 01:30:29.096
- How do you explain that?
- You didn't beat me. I beat myself.

01:30:31.014 --> 01:30:35.269
- Who are you trying to convince?
- Do you want me to prove it?

01:30:36.186 --> 01:30:41.150
It's not important, Anton.
It's forgotten.

01:30:41.316 --> 01:30:45.404
I'll prove it to you.
Do you want me to prove it?

01:30:45.571 --> 01:30:47.197
I do.

01:31:52.888 --> 01:31:55.349
Vincent!

01:31:55.974 --> 01:32:00.020
Vincent! Where's the shore?
We're too far out!

01:32:00.187 --> 01:32:03.357
Do you want to quit? Do you?

01:32:05.192 --> 01:32:07.653
No.

01:32:29.591 --> 01:32:34.972
Vincent!
How are you doing this, Vincent?

01:32:35.764 --> 01:32:39.768
How have you done any of this?
We have to go back.

01:32:39.935 --> 01:32:45.732
- No. We're close to the other side.
- Do you want to drown us both?

01:32:47.192 --> 01:32:49.945
You want to know how I did it?

01:32:50.112 --> 01:32:56.076
This is how I did it. I never
saved anything for the swim back.

01:34:39.513 --> 01:34:45.144
You couldn't see, could you?
That night, crossing the street.

01:34:46.812 --> 01:34:50.732
You crossed anyway.

01:35:04.413 --> 01:35:09.710
If you're still interested,
let me know.

01:35:15.090 --> 01:35:18.093
<i>Sorry ...</i>

01:35:21.138 --> 01:35:25.684
The wind caught it.

01:36:17.110 --> 01:36:23.116
You're flying today, aren't you?
Look at what a mess you're in.

01:36:25.619 --> 01:36:31.875
- I have your samples ready.
- I don't need any where I'm going.

01:36:36.255 --> 01:36:39.675
You might when you get back.

01:36:41.802 --> 01:36:46.431
Everything you need
to last you two lifetimes.

01:36:47.975 --> 01:36:53.981
- Why have you done all this?
- So Jerome will always be here.

01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:59.319
- Where are you going?
- I'm travelling, too.

01:37:01.530 --> 01:37:07.619
<i>- I don't know how to thank you.
- No, no ...</i>

01:37:07.828 --> 01:37:13.750
I got the better end of the deal.
I only lent you my body.

01:37:13.917 --> 01:37:17.754
You lent me your dream.

01:37:26.180 --> 01:37:30.517
Not until you're upstairs.

01:38:02.007 --> 01:38:06.386
- What is this?
- New policy.

01:38:12.059 --> 01:38:17.022
- Flight got you nervous?
- There's a problem, Lamar.

01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:23.153
I never did tell you about my son,
did I? He's a big fan of yours.

01:38:26.156 --> 01:38:31.745
Just remember that I was as good
as any and better than most.

01:38:31.912 --> 01:38:38.001
- He wants to apply here.
- I could have gone up and back.

01:38:38.836 --> 01:38:44.216
Unfortunately, my son's
not all that they promised.

01:38:44.383 --> 01:38:49.096
But then,
who knows what he could do?

01:38:49.263 --> 01:38:52.349
Right?

01:39:06.697 --> 01:39:12.953
For future reference, right-handed
men don't hold it with their left.

01:39:13.162 --> 01:39:17.082
Just one of those things.

01:39:28.177 --> 01:39:33.390
You're going to miss your flight,
Vincent.

01:42:16.804 --> 01:42:21.141
<i>For someone who was never meant
for this world, -</i>

01:42:21.308 --> 01:42:25.979
<i>- I'm suddenly having a hard time
leaving it.</i>

01:42:26.146 --> 01:42:31.276
<i>Of course, they say every atom in
our bodies was once part of a star.</i>

01:42:31.485 --> 01:42:37.574
<i>Maybe I'm not leaving.
Maybe I'm going home.</i>
