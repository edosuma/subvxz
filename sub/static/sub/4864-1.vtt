in a situation like this? Gosh!

JULIA JONES'S
Diary

01:28.631 --> 01:30.591
Dear Diary, I had that nightmare again.

01:30.633 --> 01:34.136
weight 389 lbs. cigarettes 1,42 per day
Alcohol units - Tara Reid status

01:34.178 --> 01:35.679
I fear I'll never get married.

01:36.138 --> 01:37.264
L

01:37.306 --> 01:41.060
Maybe I am destined
to be a sad old spinster...

01:41.101 --> 01:45.272
...whose only companionship comes from
an absurd amount of cats.

01:59.495 --> 02:01.789
No, that won't be me!

02:01.831 --> 02:03.582
I believe in true love.

02:05.042 --> 02:07.837
My knight in shining armor
is out there somewhere...

02:07.878 --> 02:10.172
...and I'm gonna find him.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.282
Oh, shit.

GREEK DINER

05:03.137 --> 05:04.555
Hi, Dad.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.473
Look here, Julia.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.559
When you gonna find a man
and get married?

05:08.600 --> 05:11.562
You looking old, fat, and saggy.

05:12.396 --> 05:16.358
And the mole on your forearm,
it's growing a mole.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.695
Let's put some hummus on it.

05:19.737 --> 05:21.113
Cures everything.

05:23.615 --> 05:25.617
Baby, you gotta find a man.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.245
In our race to protect our
Greek heritage--

05:28.287 --> 05:31.498
Yes, yes, yes. And my heritage too.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.501
Let us not forget,
you're also one half Indian.

05:34.543 --> 05:39.715
-Your mother's right.
-Big sister, we also Japanese.

05:39.757 --> 05:40.758
And Jewish.

05:41.258 --> 05:46.180
So you're telling me I have to marry a guy
who's a Greek-Indian-Japanese-Jew?

05:46.221 --> 05:50.601
Baby, you're acting like that's hard to find.
I mean, look around. They everywhere.

05:55.314 --> 05:58.150
Nicky. Nicky!

05:58.192 --> 05:59.443
You're Greek, right?

06:00.027 --> 06:04.073
Yeah. And Indian and Japanese
and a Jew.

06:05.991 --> 06:08.160
You wanna go out with my daughter?

06:08.202 --> 06:10.579
No, I don't like redheads. Sorry.

06:16.460 --> 06:20.589
Dad, I know I'm no beauty,
but I'm not gonna settle.

06:20.631 --> 06:25.385
I respect our heritage,
but I believe love is blind.

06:26.261 --> 06:30.265
Somewhere out there is my true love.

06:30.307 --> 06:32.434
No! Back to work.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.189
Coffee?

06:41.610 --> 06:43.403

-Excellent.

06:43.445 --> 06:45.447
Jolly good. I quite fancy some...

06:49.493 --> 06:52.454

We had this moment.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.514
What happened?

08:34.556 --> 08:37.601
I turned around and he was gone.

08:37.643 --> 08:39.977
He probably got a good look
at your mug and ran.

08:41.563 --> 08:46.109
Why don't we broaden the search
from that one guy to just any nigga?

08:46.902 --> 08:48.862
-Okay.
-Eight out of ten guys believe...

08:48.904 --> 08:53.116
...the first kiss will tell them everything
they need to know about a relationship.

08:53.158 --> 08:56.036

my Prince Charming.

14:39.379 --> 14:41.881
Nice aim, Grant. Good eye.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.896

14:57.564 --> 14:58.857

15:45.320 --> 15:47.405
Oh, yeah, that's it.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.824
Oh, God.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.329
Oh, yeah.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.998

16:29.531 --> 16:31.157
Yes!

16:37.956 --> 16:39.833
Oh, God.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.168
Gosh.

16:42.210 --> 16:44.587
So you're saying
you do want the pork chops?

16:44.629 --> 16:46.089
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

16:46.131 --> 16:48.258
I'll have what he's having.

16:48.299 --> 16:50.510
So tell me about you.

16:50.552 --> 16:53.054
Oh, I'm just a waitress.

16:53.722 --> 16:57.225
But I want to go to school
to be a pastry chef.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.478
Oh, hi. My name is Julia Jones.

17:00.520 --> 17:04.232
And for my admissions essay,
I'm gonna show all of you at Harvard...

17:04.273 --> 17:08.278
...why I would make
an amazing pastry chef.

17:09.362 --> 17:13.742
JULIA GONE WILD

17:14.117 --> 17:15.868
What a coincidence.

17:15.910 --> 17:17.787
I love pie.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.790
-I've gotta take you downtown for the best--
-Hummus pie?

17:20.832 --> 17:22.166
You've been there?

17:24.210 --> 17:25.962
That's actually my recipe.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.840
But tell me more about you.

17:29.382 --> 17:32.844
Like, what's your favorite love song?

17:35.513 --> 17:37.557
It's kind of corny.

17:37.599 --> 17:38.725
Oh, come on.

17:55.116 --> 17:56.201
You're that waitress.

17:58.661 --> 17:59.954
You've changed.

17:59.996 --> 18:03.833
Well, I was sort of going
through a phase.

18:06.836 --> 18:08.922
I was downright ugly.

18:10.048 --> 18:11.966
I don't remember you ever being ugly.

18:14.344 --> 18:15.553
But I remember you.

18:26.314 --> 18:32.153
I can't explain it, but when I'm with you
I just feel so alive.

18:32.821 --> 18:37.867
-Me too.
-I just wanna scream and shout and....

18:38.701 --> 18:40.537
Bum fight?

18:45.708 --> 18:47.168
Julia?

18:50.463 --> 18:51.464
Come on.

19:31.629 --> 19:33.172
Yes!

19:33.214 --> 19:35.341
Yes!

19:35.383 --> 19:37.594
Yes!

19:37.635 --> 19:39.345
Oh, yeah.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.936
That was amazing.

19:46.978 --> 19:48.396
It sure was.

19:57.030 --> 19:59.866
She faked it, Grant.

20:00.950 --> 20:03.870
But I didn't.

20:05.914 --> 20:07.582
Meow.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.127
Meow.

20:46.037 --> 20:47.997

20:56.673 --> 21:00.843
No! No!

21:15.900 --> 21:17.485
-Tingly.
-Grant...

21:17.527 --> 21:20.738
...how would you feel
about meeting my parents?

21:46.764 --> 21:48.891
So, Grant...

21:49.809 --> 21:51.811
-...ever knock anyone up?
-Mom.

21:51.853 --> 21:55.732
Well, I want many grandkids, and how do I
know if he's shooting blanks or not?

22:09.078 --> 22:11.497
Just leave the sample on the counter.

22:31.476 --> 22:32.477
Sorry.

22:34.604 --> 22:35.855
That's Jinxers.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.447
Taught him how to do that.

23:17.688 --> 23:21.359
Julia told me your last name.
How do you pronounce it?

23:21.400 --> 23:22.652
Just how it's spelled.

23:24.070 --> 23:27.657
F-O-C-K-Y-E-R-D-O-D-E-R.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.283

23:35.873 --> 23:40.002
-Allergic to cats?
-No, no, I love cats.

23:40.044 --> 23:44.006
In fact, growing up on a farm,
I once milked a cat.

23:45.508 --> 23:47.802
I got nipples, Grant.

23:47.844 --> 23:49.595
Can you milk me?

23:55.977 --> 23:58.563
May I say that's an exquisite vase?

23:58.604 --> 24:00.314
An ancient artifact, I presume.

24:00.356 --> 24:04.569
That's actually an urn
containing the remains of Frank's mother.

24:07.280 --> 24:09.949
Well, I'm sure your mother
would want to celebrate...

24:09.991 --> 24:13.077
...that Julia finally applied
to pastry school.

24:13.119 --> 24:16.664
-What? School?
-Don't you want me to better myself?

24:16.706 --> 24:19.333
No! I want you to work at the diner
until you die.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.544
Grant was just kidding. Right, Grant?

24:25.256 --> 24:26.757
No.

24:26.799 --> 24:29.260
No, no, no!

24:32.221 --> 24:34.140
Mama!

24:34.182 --> 24:36.058
-Mama!
-Grandma.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.604
Jinxers. Jinxers, no.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.732
Grandma Jones. Oh, God.

24:42.773 --> 24:44.650
No. Jinxers, stop it.

24:44.692 --> 24:46.402
-Hey!
-Jinxers.

24:46.444 --> 24:47.820
-Jinxers, no.
-Oh, no, no.

24:47.862 --> 24:49.822
-No.
-Jinxers, no.

24:49.864 --> 24:51.616
-Jinxers, no.
-Oh, no.

24:51.657 --> 24:53.034
No!

24:53.075 --> 24:54.660
-Get off my mama!
-Bad!

24:54.702 --> 24:55.828
Stop humping!

24:55.870 --> 24:57.747
-Bad kitty.
-Please.

24:57.788 --> 25:01.542
-Jinxers! No.
-I didn't teach him how to do that.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.711
-Jinxers! Bad cat!
-God!

25:03.753 --> 25:06.547
Jinxers, no!

25:08.007 --> 25:09.008
Mama!

25:09.926 --> 25:11.636
That was a disaster.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.221
It wasn't that bad.

25:13.262 --> 25:15.806
You desecrated
my grandmother's remains...

25:15.848 --> 25:17.725
...and my father hates you.

25:17.767 --> 25:20.603
Why didn't you tell your parents
about pastry school?

25:20.645 --> 25:24.398
I'm working my way up to it.
I'm just waiting for the right time.

25:24.440 --> 25:26.234
Julia, you're a grown woman.

25:27.109 --> 25:31.530
If you haven't noticed,
my family is totally controlling.

25:31.572 --> 25:34.617
They meddle in every aspect of my life.

25:34.659 --> 25:38.746
Not to mention, no one in our family
has ever dated outside of our culture.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.248
He reminds me of Webster.

25:40.289 --> 25:44.335
I just don't see
how this could work between us.

25:44.377 --> 25:46.170
Look, so your family's difficult.

25:46.212 --> 25:48.047
Whose isn't?

25:48.089 --> 25:51.133
Until I met you, my life was boring.

25:51.175 --> 25:53.970
But you, you're smart...

25:54.011 --> 25:56.472
...and interesting...

25:56.514 --> 25:58.683
...and beautiful.

25:59.392 --> 26:01.602
I just want to be with you.

26:03.229 --> 26:05.064
Did you say I was beautiful?

26:06.274 --> 26:07.817
Come with me.

26:08.943 --> 26:10.569
It's just a little Jesus juice.

26:11.612 --> 26:13.531
Where are you taking me?

26:13.572 --> 26:15.658
-What are we...?
-You'll see.

26:29.130 --> 26:30.381
Oh, my God.

26:31.382 --> 26:33.592
Oh, my God.

26:33.634 --> 26:34.927
Oh, my God.

26:38.639 --> 26:39.890
Oh, my God.

26:40.474 --> 26:42.935
Julia Jones...

26:42.977 --> 26:44.395
...will you marry me?

26:45.813 --> 26:49.358
Yes, Grant Fockyerdoder,
I will marry you.

27:01.078 --> 27:02.872
How much will you give me for this?

27:02.913 --> 27:05.416
No. No!

27:12.757 --> 27:14.842
-Fifty bucks.
-Shit, that's it?

27:18.220 --> 27:21.015
But it will destroy all evil.

27:21.057 --> 27:23.517
Oh, screw off, wizard!

27:28.105 --> 27:33.152
My precious.

27:39.075 --> 27:41.827
Before you set the wedding date...

27:41.869 --> 27:43.412
...I wanted to meet your parents.

27:44.246 --> 27:47.041
Because, frankly,
I don't know much about you.

27:49.335 --> 27:52.171
I understand, homeboy.

27:57.927 --> 28:01.263
I'll be watching you.

28:01.305 --> 28:03.808
If you do anything
to corrupt my daughter....

28:03.849 --> 28:06.268
You'll bring me down to Chinatown?

28:07.019 --> 28:08.145
Chinatown?

28:08.187 --> 28:12.441
I'll take your bitch ass to 134th Street.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.860
Bust you in the head with a pipe.

28:18.406 --> 28:19.990
Hi, Little Jack.

28:20.825 --> 28:22.785
How come you have Betty's baby?

28:22.827 --> 28:25.121
She's at a swingers' convention
this weekend...

28:25.162 --> 28:28.374
-...so we said we'd take care of him.
-Oh, how nice.

28:28.416 --> 28:32.169
Betty's such a good mother.
She's teaching Little Jack sign language.

28:32.211 --> 28:36.966
Oh, I heard about this.
Real cutting-edge stuff.

28:39.260 --> 28:42.680
"What happens when the ho
doesn't give up all the cash?"

28:45.891 --> 28:49.812
That's right, Little Jack.
"Keep your pimp hand strong."

28:51.897 --> 28:53.649
Beeyotch.

28:53.691 --> 28:55.484
His first word!

28:55.526 --> 28:58.779
-Little Jack, what did you say?
-Beeyotch.

29:04.702 --> 29:07.204
FOCKYERDODER
ISLE

29:09.957 --> 29:11.125
Is that your dad?

29:19.091 --> 29:20.092
Figures.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.904
Grant!

29:39.945 --> 29:41.280
My boy!

29:43.115 --> 29:44.950
It's good to see you.

29:44.992 --> 29:48.162
This is my fiancÃ©e, Julia.
And her parents, Linda and Frank.

29:48.204 --> 29:51.040
Bernie Fockyerdoder.
Pleased to meet all of you.

29:51.081 --> 29:52.833
Frank, give me some sugar.

29:52.875 --> 29:54.585
Put her there!

29:55.461 --> 29:56.795
All right, all right.

29:56.837 --> 29:59.548
-And this must be your little girl.
-No, that's my wife.

29:59.590 --> 30:02.218
Wife? So young, so pretty.

30:02.968 --> 30:06.472
And you must be Julia.
What a beautiful moment this is.

30:06.514 --> 30:09.892
So beautiful. Just beautiful.

30:11.560 --> 30:13.604
Dad. Dad.

30:14.104 --> 30:16.190
What? We're all family now.

30:16.232 --> 30:17.691
I'll just go get the luggage.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.818
So, what was that
you were doing back there?

30:19.860 --> 30:23.531
-I was just practicing Capuerta.
-Capa-what?

30:23.572 --> 30:26.534
Capuerta, the Brazilian martial art
of dance fighting.

30:26.575 --> 30:28.452
-Beeyotch.
-I've been doing it for weeks.

30:29.995 --> 30:31.163
It keeps me level.

30:34.959 --> 30:36.544
Come on, let's go meet Roz.

30:39.547 --> 30:40.798
Roz!

30:40.839 --> 30:43.425
You're going to love her.
Everybody, this is Roz.

30:43.467 --> 30:44.593
IDIOT'S
Tantric Sex

30:49.014 --> 30:54.937
I've been kvelling to meet
this meshuggenah goyim shiksa all day.

31:01.694 --> 31:03.821
So, Grant tells me you're a doctor.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.906
I'm a sex therapist.

31:05.948 --> 31:08.075
I specialize in teenage impotency.

31:09.243 --> 31:10.411
Who's thirsty?

31:10.995 --> 31:14.373
-Mum, no.
-Oh, Grantulla's just embarrassed...

31:14.415 --> 31:17.293
...because he lost his virginity
to the housekeeper.

31:23.507 --> 31:25.050
Hey, Eduardo.

31:28.178 --> 31:29.680
Hi, Grant.

31:50.075 --> 31:51.827
Thanks, Eduardo.

31:55.956 --> 31:58.417
So is it Harry?

31:58.459 --> 32:00.753
-Is what hairy?
-Your name.

32:00.794 --> 32:03.631
-No, no. It's Bernie.
-Oh, no, but it is hairy.

32:03.672 --> 32:06.842
-What are you talking about?
-Picture this with 4 pounds of hair.

32:06.884 --> 32:07.968
Oh, stop.

32:08.427 --> 32:10.888
So when's the big date?

32:10.929 --> 32:13.265
Well, we wanted a long engagement...

32:13.307 --> 32:15.643
...so we're getting married this Sunday.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.853
Oh, hell, no.
I'm not paying for that wedding.

32:17.895 --> 32:21.440
Oh, don't have a conniption, bubbelah.
We'll pay for it.

32:21.482 --> 32:22.816
Of course.

32:22.858 --> 32:25.944
I got a great wedding planner.
You'll meet her tomorrow morning.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.363
Let's have a toast.

32:27.404 --> 32:31.116
To great, big matzo balls.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.372
I couldn't be happier.

32:37.539 --> 32:39.083
Thanks, Dad.

32:39.124 --> 32:41.168
Because Nicky has agreed
to marry you.

32:52.680 --> 32:56.100
-Nicky.
-Yeah. Good job.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.894
Looking good. Nice.

33:00.062 --> 33:05.359
Dad, my whole life I've had this dream...

33:05.401 --> 33:09.238
...that a prince would someday
come and rescue me.

33:09.279 --> 33:11.490
Grant is that guy.

33:11.532 --> 33:13.158
He's my prince.

33:13.867 --> 33:16.328
-And he's the one I'm gonna marry.
-No.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.165
You'll never marry Grant.
I don't trust him.

33:20.833 --> 33:22.167
You'll marry Nicky.

33:22.209 --> 33:26.255
You know, thinking about the honeymoon
makes me, like, really horny.

33:26.296 --> 33:27.506
Like, a lot.

33:35.013 --> 33:37.850
Wow, you seem tense.

33:39.226 --> 33:40.519
When was the last time...

33:40.561 --> 33:43.063
-...you and Frank were intimate?
-It's been a while.

33:47.776 --> 33:49.153
It sure has.

33:50.529 --> 33:54.408
-Is that all you got?
-Hold on.

33:55.909 --> 33:59.246
-How do you think it's going?
-I think it's going really well.

33:59.288 --> 34:00.497
-You do?
-Yeah.

34:00.539 --> 34:04.168
Everyone's getting along famously.
Even our dads are hitting it off.

34:05.335 --> 34:07.880
Man, you might wanna
put your shirt back on.

34:31.277 --> 34:32.487
Man.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.464
The wedding planner will see you now.

34:55.177 --> 34:56.261
I'm Jell-O.

34:56.969 --> 34:59.223
Please, have a seat.

35:02.518 --> 35:06.563
Now, I'm here to plan
your dream wedding.

35:06.605 --> 35:09.024
So tell me what you want.

35:09.066 --> 35:12.027
Well, we want a traditional wedding.

35:12.069 --> 35:14.613
Something simple, yet elegant.

35:14.655 --> 35:16.698
Yo, I know exactly the place.

35:19.326 --> 35:20.452
TACO BUTT

35:20.494 --> 35:22.079
Think outside my buns.

35:22.329 --> 35:25.624
It's not quite what we had in mind.

35:25.666 --> 35:27.751
That's the best I can do on short notice.

35:27.793 --> 35:30.712
You gotta book the caterer,
pick a piÃ±ata...

35:30.754 --> 35:33.882
-...choose your best man.
-I've already taken care of that.

35:33.924 --> 35:36.885
-My best mate, Andy, flew in this morning.
-Andy?

35:36.927 --> 35:41.515
Yeah, we'll meet up at the hotel later.
I think you two will hit it off tremendously.

35:41.557 --> 35:43.016
I can't wait.

35:43.058 --> 35:46.562
And I can't wait till you see
who I booked for the entertainment.

36:01.660 --> 36:03.078
-No!
-No!

36:10.961 --> 36:13.922
So where is this best man of yours?

36:13.964 --> 36:16.383
Andy!

36:26.643 --> 36:30.230
-Andy's not a guy?
-A guy? Heavens, no.

36:48.457 --> 36:51.126
It's great we've remained so close...

36:51.168 --> 36:53.587
...even after the engagement
fell through.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.548
You two were engaged?

37:04.431 --> 37:05.515
Ages ago.

37:07.184 --> 37:09.394
It was more physical
than anything, really.

37:15.859 --> 37:17.736
Just constant sex.

37:21.782 --> 37:22.824
Sex.

37:23.825 --> 37:25.285
Sex.

37:26.995 --> 37:28.830
Sex. Sex. Sex.

37:28.872 --> 37:31.083
Sex. Sex. Sex.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.918
Sex. Sex. Sex.

37:40.550 --> 37:44.930
So, you realized it just wasn't right?

37:44.972 --> 37:47.683
Well, she realized it wasn't right.

37:47.724 --> 37:49.685
She dumped me.

37:49.726 --> 37:51.603
Just wasn't ready to settle down.

38:13.542 --> 38:15.711
Why is she in slow motion?

38:15.752 --> 38:17.337
She likes to make an entrance.

38:19.423 --> 38:20.424
Grant!

38:29.891 --> 38:32.352
This is Julia.

38:35.772 --> 38:39.276
Oh, I have heard so much about you.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.030
Now, Grant told me
how attractive you were...

38:43.071 --> 38:46.033
...but he never mentioned
you were flat-chested.

38:46.074 --> 38:48.076
How cute.

39:00.589 --> 39:04.926
Excuse me, while I get out
of these wet clothes.

39:20.650 --> 39:22.569
So how did you two meet?

39:22.611 --> 39:24.196
We were in Beverly Hills.

39:24.488 --> 39:25.947
TIFFANY & CO.

39:25.989 --> 39:27.783
GUCCI

39:27.824 --> 39:29.743

Rodeo Dr

40:02.692 --> 40:06.071
I'll give you $100 for the week.

40:06.113 --> 40:07.614
Sounds quite reasonable.

40:07.656 --> 40:11.118
Okay, this is just too weird.
Can we dissolve back now?

40:11.159 --> 40:15.747
And so eventually you got engaged,
and then you broke up ages ago.

40:15.789 --> 40:19.209
Sure, if you call three weeks
"ages ago."

40:20.418 --> 40:23.046
You were engaged to her
three weeks ago?

40:24.464 --> 40:27.801
Honestly, Julia,
you have nothing to be jealous about.

40:28.301 --> 40:30.804
Just because I see Grant
with another woman...

40:30.846 --> 40:33.181
...doesn't mean I want him back.

40:47.320 --> 40:48.321
Finger sandwich?

40:50.657 --> 40:53.034
Okay, I'll go first.

40:53.451 --> 40:56.663
Let me say,
we don't really need to be here.

40:56.705 --> 41:00.125
-See, we've been dating for five days.
-Six.

41:00.167 --> 41:02.752
Five, six days.

41:03.086 --> 41:05.088
And this is like a check-up for us.

41:05.130 --> 41:08.175
There's this huge space between us...

41:08.216 --> 41:12.012
...and it keeps getting bigger and bigger.

41:15.098 --> 41:16.600
How honest are you with him?

41:17.726 --> 41:19.603
Pretty honest.

41:19.644 --> 41:22.606
I mean, it's not like I lie to him
or anything.

41:23.940 --> 41:25.400
I just....

41:27.319 --> 41:30.197
I mean, I have little secrets.

41:30.238 --> 41:32.532
Everyone has secrets.

41:34.034 --> 41:36.161
I have hepatitis C.

41:42.542 --> 41:44.586
How does that make you feel?

41:46.588 --> 41:48.590
I'm not sure, really.

41:50.967 --> 41:53.845
Let me clarify. I love Julia.

41:53.887 --> 41:58.266
I want her to be happy.

41:58.308 --> 42:01.061
I want good things for her.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.939
But there are times....

42:21.039 --> 42:22.165
You know?

42:22.207 --> 42:25.126
When she's sleeping,
just take a pillow and....

42:38.139 --> 42:39.266
BEST
BRIDE

42:39.307 --> 42:45.480
-Thanks for helping me pick out my dress.
-To be honest, I was surprised you called.

42:45.522 --> 42:47.732
Well, you're a part of Grant's life.

42:47.774 --> 42:50.986
And that means
you're a part of my life too.

42:51.903 --> 42:55.240
You look like a princess.

43:00.704 --> 43:03.206
You don't think it's a bit too much?

43:03.248 --> 43:05.208
Oh, not at all.

43:05.250 --> 43:07.502
I'll go get some pins to fit it.

43:35.322 --> 43:38.325
Why do you insist on dressing me
in these fruity outfits?

43:38.366 --> 43:40.910
I'm gonna take this lollipop
and shove it up your ass.

43:42.495 --> 43:44.789
I can hear everyone's thoughts!

43:44.831 --> 43:48.043
I love Puerto Rican men. They're spicy.

43:48.543 --> 43:52.213
It's like I'm trapped
in a bad Mel Gibson movie.

43:52.255 --> 43:56.551
What the hell was I thinking?
He's a freaking backup dancer.

43:57.093 --> 43:59.554
Dude, I married Britney Spears.

44:00.472 --> 44:01.681
I'm rich!

44:01.723 --> 44:05.226
I'm rich, beeyotch! Rich!

44:05.268 --> 44:07.145
Is the bride-to-be ready?

44:07.187 --> 44:09.230
Bride-to-be? Shit.

44:09.272 --> 44:10.774
Not if I can help it.

44:11.399 --> 44:13.902
I've got 24 hours
to break up this wedding.

44:13.943 --> 44:15.153
No.

44:15.195 --> 44:16.196
Yes.

44:17.238 --> 44:20.283
I'll turn Grant against you
and make him love me again.

44:20.325 --> 44:22.577
Me, me, me!

44:23.078 --> 44:24.746
Stay away from me.

45:53.126 --> 45:55.170
What is it now?

45:55.211 --> 45:59.924
Grant's got an ex-fiancÃ©e.
And she has a thing for him, I just know it.

45:59.966 --> 46:02.510
And they have this long,
romantic history.

46:03.303 --> 46:05.972
How can I measure up to that?

46:06.014 --> 46:07.849
Skimpy Bikini Illustrated
The Swimsuit Issue That Self Combusts

46:07.891 --> 46:09.642
You can't. She's fine as hell.

46:11.102 --> 46:12.937
I would tear that shit up!

46:13.855 --> 46:17.442
You know, everything was going so well
until she turns up.

46:17.484 --> 46:20.528
Look, he's not with Andy anymore.
He's with you.

46:20.570 --> 46:23.990
You gotta put aside your insecurities.
It'll all work out.

46:24.032 --> 46:27.285
-Do you really believe that?
-No. But my white customers do.

46:31.664 --> 46:34.042
Look, I believe in you and Grant.

46:34.083 --> 46:37.170
And before you know it,
you'll be walking down the aisle.

46:37.420 --> 46:39.756
And saying our vows.

46:39.797 --> 46:42.133
And our first dance.

46:42.175 --> 46:45.053
Starting the fire. Starting the fire.
Starting the fire.

46:45.094 --> 46:48.181
The Q-Tip. The Q-Tip. The Q-Tip.

46:48.223 --> 46:50.016
Throw it away. Throw it away.

46:50.058 --> 46:51.518
You call that dancing?

46:52.477 --> 46:53.603
No.

46:55.230 --> 46:58.942
You see this?
This is where you live, right here.

46:58.983 --> 47:00.985
This is your home.

47:01.569 --> 47:03.154
Well, how about this?

47:11.204 --> 47:12.872
That bitch be krumping!

47:33.059 --> 47:34.477
It's okay.

47:34.519 --> 47:37.272
It's okay.
She's never gonna break us up.

47:37.313 --> 47:40.483
Grant and I just have to get through
the rehearsal dinner...

47:40.525 --> 47:43.403
...and then tomorrow's the big day.

47:43.444 --> 47:47.824
Once we're married,
everything will be perfect.

47:47.865 --> 47:48.950
Who are you kidding?

47:50.910 --> 47:54.163
Grant's never gonna marry you.
You're not good enough.

47:54.205 --> 47:56.291
He's meant to be with Andy.

47:56.332 --> 47:58.501
-Don't say that!
-This is who you really are.

47:58.543 --> 48:01.337
Worst Foods
Mayonnaise

48:01.379 --> 48:03.131
You're a frump girl.

48:03.673 --> 48:07.760
You may look different,
but inside you'll always be me.

48:07.802 --> 48:09.512
No, please, stop.

48:10.179 --> 48:13.308
You'll be stuck in that diner
till the end of time.

48:14.100 --> 48:16.102
I don't believe you.

48:18.354 --> 48:19.981
True love is a myth.

48:20.023 --> 48:22.191
You better hurry up and marry Nicky...

48:22.233 --> 48:24.777
...before you end up a fat,
dusty old maid.

48:24.819 --> 48:26.112
Never!

48:26.154 --> 48:27.447
You'll see.

48:32.285 --> 48:34.454
GREEK DINER

48:36.581 --> 48:38.291
Quiet, everyone. Quiet.

48:38.333 --> 48:40.460
Roz has a few words to say.

48:40.501 --> 48:43.171
Oh, thank you, hon.

48:45.840 --> 48:48.217
I would like to make a toast.

48:48.718 --> 48:50.637
To Grant and Julia.

48:51.346 --> 48:53.931
Yeah! What?

48:53.973 --> 48:56.976
Okay! Get crunk!

48:57.018 --> 48:58.436
Get crunked!

49:20.375 --> 49:21.376
You like it?

49:22.543 --> 49:25.213
You look ravishing.

49:27.507 --> 49:29.467
What? What's wrong?

49:30.176 --> 49:35.431
Grant, your whole courtship
has been rocky to say the least.

49:36.683 --> 49:41.062
I just hope you're not rushing
into this marriage with Julia...

49:41.771 --> 49:44.691
...as a way of getting over me.

49:45.358 --> 49:46.651
I....

50:04.252 --> 50:06.003
Oh, dear God.

50:06.462 --> 50:07.463
A carousel.

50:11.050 --> 50:13.386
I.... I better get back.

50:22.103 --> 50:25.523
Grant, this is our rehearsal dinner.

50:25.565 --> 50:27.692
We're getting married tomorrow.

50:29.444 --> 50:32.613
I need to know,
do you still have feelings for Andy?

50:33.656 --> 50:35.032
Of course not.

50:36.284 --> 50:37.869
I trust you.

50:37.910 --> 50:39.912
I just don't want to get hurt.

50:40.580 --> 50:42.290
You have nothing to worry about.

50:43.332 --> 50:45.042
I'm devoted to you.

50:45.835 --> 50:46.961
Forever.

50:48.463 --> 50:51.382
The moment I saw you

50:52.967 --> 50:56.596
Before I proposed to you

50:57.513 --> 51:00.558
We said a little prayer for you

51:02.143 --> 51:05.313
While combing my hair now

51:05.354 --> 51:08.816
You're wondering what's
Under my dress now

51:08.858 --> 51:12.361
-We said a little prayer for you
-We said a little prayer for you

51:12.403 --> 51:15.323
Forever, forever
He gives you his heart

51:15.364 --> 51:16.616
And he loves you

51:16.657 --> 51:19.410
Forever and ever
You'll never break up

51:19.452 --> 51:20.661
Divorce will cost you

51:20.703 --> 51:23.498
Together, together
That's how it must be

51:23.539 --> 51:24.665
For this love story

51:24.707 --> 51:28.252
Screw Grant
She must marry Nicky

51:30.379 --> 51:34.008
I really do love you, dear

51:34.050 --> 51:37.386
But Andy keeps whispering in his ear

51:37.428 --> 51:39.764
We'll say a little prayer for you

51:41.599 --> 51:43.810
Grant and I will get hitched

51:44.519 --> 51:48.022
If we survive my family
And that scheming bitch

51:48.064 --> 51:51.275
We'll say a little prayer for you

51:51.317 --> 51:54.278
Forever, forever
He gives you his heart

51:54.320 --> 51:55.738
And he loves you

51:55.780 --> 51:58.491
Forever and ever
You'll never break up

51:58.533 --> 51:59.992
Divorce will cost you

52:00.034 --> 52:02.537
Together, together
That's how it must be

52:02.578 --> 52:03.830
For this love story

52:03.871 --> 52:07.667
I have one night to stop this wedding

52:09.502 --> 52:11.838
My daughter get busy

52:11.879 --> 52:13.089
-Get busy
-Get busy

52:13.130 --> 52:16.551
Just back that thing up

52:16.592 --> 52:19.846
He'll be true

52:19.887 --> 52:21.305
Please, love me too

52:21.347 --> 52:22.974
Answer his prayers

52:23.015 --> 52:25.142
Try position 22

52:25.184 --> 52:27.270
Getting your swerve on, baby

52:28.062 --> 52:29.605
Answer his prayers

52:29.647 --> 52:32.400
Forever, forever

52:32.441 --> 52:33.651
And he loves you

52:33.693 --> 52:36.529
Forever and ever
You'll never break up

52:36.571 --> 52:37.989
Divorce will cost you

52:38.030 --> 52:40.658
Together, together
That's how it must be

52:40.700 --> 52:42.118
For this love story

52:42.159 --> 52:46.455
Will the ending be good or crappy?

53:06.434 --> 53:08.019
No!

53:08.060 --> 53:11.355
Not a zit on my wedding day.

53:11.397 --> 53:12.982
No.

53:35.254 --> 53:37.506
Saint Sophia Community Church
JONES FOCKYERDODER WEDDING

53:38.215 --> 53:39.884
Where the hell is Julia?

53:40.468 --> 53:41.761
SHE'S
LATE

53:41.802 --> 53:46.390
Grant, I wouldn't be your best man
unless I told you this.

53:47.141 --> 53:49.018
Julia doesn't deserve you.

53:50.102 --> 53:51.604
Oh, come on.

53:51.646 --> 53:53.522
She's an hour late for her own wedding.

53:54.607 --> 53:58.110
Maybe she's got cold feet because
she knows it's not right between you two.

54:01.489 --> 54:03.199
Do you ever think about us?

54:04.158 --> 54:07.119
-Yeah.
-Me too.

54:10.957 --> 54:12.333
My grandmother's ring.

54:12.375 --> 54:15.336
She gave you this ring on her deathbed
and made you promise...

54:15.378 --> 54:18.965
...to give it to the woman you wanted to
spend the rest of your life with.

54:19.006 --> 54:20.466
You gave it to me.

54:25.221 --> 54:26.847
My grandfather's toe ring.

54:26.889 --> 54:29.350
And didn't he give you this ring
on his deathbed...

54:29.392 --> 54:33.020
...and make you promise to give it
to the woman you'd cherish forever?

54:34.105 --> 54:36.983
You gave that to me too.

54:38.109 --> 54:39.568
Julia--

54:39.610 --> 54:42.488
She's just the rebound girl.

54:42.530 --> 54:46.325
I'm ready to take you back.
Choose me. Marry me.

54:47.743 --> 54:52.456
Andy, I just don't feel the same way
about you anymore.

54:52.498 --> 54:53.582
Julia's the one.

54:55.876 --> 54:58.295
Then one last kiss.

55:08.764 --> 55:10.016
Julia, no.

55:21.444 --> 55:22.653
Julia Please Take me back!

55:24.530 --> 55:26.449
I FXXXED UP BIG TIME

55:28.075 --> 55:29.702
I'M A JERK

55:32.538 --> 55:34.165
...A REAL
ASSHOLE...

56:18.918 --> 56:21.962
Shut up! It's 4 in the morning!

56:22.004 --> 56:23.798
Asshole!

56:24.340 --> 56:26.759
Turn that crap off!

56:34.642 --> 56:37.686
I'm trying to watch
Desperate Housewives.

56:39.021 --> 56:41.607
It's called an iPod, get one!

56:49.406 --> 56:52.535
Lonely Woman

DINER

57:44.837 --> 57:46.380
Julia.

57:51.302 --> 57:53.762
Let's get you out of that funk.

58:06.692 --> 58:11.405
Julia, will you marry me?

58:15.159 --> 58:16.410
Please?

58:20.664 --> 58:23.209
-That was good, right?
-Yeah.

58:24.126 --> 58:26.503
I know Nicky's a little rough
around the edges...

58:27.171 --> 58:29.465
...but give him a chance.

58:30.966 --> 58:34.678
You know, when your mother and I first
got married we barely knew each other.

58:34.720 --> 58:36.555
I was a mail-order bride...

58:36.597 --> 58:38.599
...could barely speak
the English language.

58:39.225 --> 58:42.478
-Dad, you're from Jersey.
-I'm trying to make a point here.

58:43.062 --> 58:45.439
At first, Linda and I couldn't get along.

58:45.481 --> 58:49.026
But we grew to understand
and even respect each other.

58:49.902 --> 58:52.613
I'm proud to say
we've been married for 30 years...

58:52.655 --> 58:56.575
...and I have you and your sister
to show for it.

58:57.243 --> 59:00.537
Now, maybe that's not
the fairy tale you dream of...

59:00.579 --> 59:02.665
...but that's real life.

59:03.374 --> 59:04.625
So, what do you say?

59:07.836 --> 59:10.839
I've been fooling myself all along.

59:10.881 --> 59:13.425
There is no Prince Charming.

59:14.051 --> 59:18.472
And true love is something
that only exists in the movies.

59:21.850 --> 59:23.769
Okay, Dad.

59:23.811 --> 59:25.187
I'll marry Nicky.

59:27.731 --> 59:28.899
Back to work.

59:32.319 --> 59:35.030
JUSTICE OF THE PEACE

59:51.297 --> 59:52.298
You're crying.

59:54.174 --> 59:56.677
Tears of joy, Dad.

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:05.269
Thanks, Frank. I'll take it from here.

01:00:07.938 --> 01:00:10.399
We are gathered here to join this man...

01:00:10.441 --> 01:00:13.652
...and this woman in holy matrimony.

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:18.324
Marriage is a contract
that should not be taken lightly.

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:22.828
It must be honored by two people
who are truly in love.

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:09.792
DA SHIZNIT

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:29.436
If anyone has any reason
why these two should not be married...

01:01:29.478 --> 01:01:32.815
...speak now or forever hold your peace.

01:01:43.992 --> 01:01:46.120
-I object.
-Thank God.

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:53.335
This isn't what you wanted.

01:01:54.128 --> 01:01:55.295
It's what I wanted.

01:01:56.797 --> 01:01:59.800
I was wrong about Grant.
He's a good man.

01:01:59.842 --> 01:02:02.302
He even liked you
when you were butt-ugly.

01:02:02.344 --> 01:02:04.471
-How do you--?
-I saw it in your flashback.

01:02:04.513 --> 01:02:07.015
You and Grant were meant
to be together.

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.976
I don't know.

01:02:09.017 --> 01:02:10.394
You need to read this.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.190
How to Lose a Girl in 10 Days

01:02:15.232 --> 01:02:16.692
My darling Julia, I'm sorry.

01:02:16.733 --> 01:02:18.735
So sorry.

01:02:18.777 --> 01:02:21.488
So very, very sorry.

01:02:22.364 --> 01:02:25.075
And yet "sorry" seems to be
the hardest word to say.

01:02:25.993 --> 01:02:29.621
If you can ever forgive me,
and you're ready to make that leap...

01:02:29.663 --> 01:02:32.583
...I promise I'll be there to catch you.

01:02:32.624 --> 01:02:35.127
If you still love me the way I love you...

01:02:35.169 --> 01:02:38.505
...then meet me where
Meg Ryan met Tom Hanks.

01:02:38.547 --> 01:02:40.007
On the Internet?

01:02:40.048 --> 01:02:42.759
No, not in You've Got Mail,
in Sleepless in Seattle.

01:02:43.677 --> 01:02:47.931
Right. The observation deck
of the Empire State Building.

01:02:47.973 --> 01:02:49.349
But how do I get there?

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:52.561
I'll MapQuest directions
and IM it to your BlackBerry.

01:02:52.603 --> 01:02:55.689
But I only have a T-Mobile Sidekick.

01:02:55.731 --> 01:02:57.608
You can borrow my Treo 650.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.613
How about we just meet
where we had our first date?

01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:04.364
A Restaurant?

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:06.742
But that's way uptown.
Traffic's a nightmare.

01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:09.953
The rooftop of your apartment building?

01:03:09.995 --> 01:03:11.955
Okay, great.

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:15.083
This issue's six months old.

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:16.793
I hope he's still waiting.

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:19.046
He'd be a fool not to wait
for my daughter.

01:03:19.087 --> 01:03:22.257
-Go get him, baby.
-Thanks, Dad.

01:03:44.238 --> 01:03:46.156
Taxi, taxi!

01:03:46.198 --> 01:03:47.199
Taxi!

01:03:50.953 --> 01:03:52.746
GIVE UP HONEY...
SHE AIN'T COMING!

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:54.957
Let's go, someone!

01:03:54.998 --> 01:03:56.124
Someone, please help!

01:03:56.166 --> 01:03:58.752
Trick, you getting on my nerves.

01:03:58.794 --> 01:04:00.587
I need to get across town fast.

01:04:09.972 --> 01:04:11.181
I owe you.

01:04:11.223 --> 01:04:13.892
Damn straight! I'm Hitch, bitch.

01:04:49.928 --> 01:04:52.139
Come on. Open up.

01:05:00.522 --> 01:05:01.940
Please.

01:05:01.982 --> 01:05:04.151
Oh, please.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:46.526
He's mine!

01:05:47.778 --> 01:05:49.946
Keep your damn hands off my man.

01:06:17.391 --> 01:06:18.975
I'm too late.

01:06:20.352 --> 01:06:21.895
Julia!

01:06:35.534 --> 01:06:38.120
What happens after the prince
rescues the princess?

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:41.206
She rescues him right back.

01:06:42.124 --> 01:06:44.668
You make me want to be a better man.

01:06:45.961 --> 01:06:47.921
You had me at hello.

01:06:48.630 --> 01:06:53.093
I'm just a girl standing in front of a boy...

01:06:53.135 --> 01:06:55.971
...asking him to love her.

01:07:36.303 --> 01:07:39.431
What? I'm also an ordained minister.

01:07:46.688 --> 01:07:51.109
By the powers vested in me,
I now pronounce you man and wife.

01:07:51.151 --> 01:07:52.778
Show her some love, man.

01:08:13.882 --> 01:08:15.592
Bravo!

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:43.578
Julia.

01:08:44.246 --> 01:08:46.163
This is for you.

01:08:50.669 --> 01:08:52.962
It's a vaginal thermometer.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:57.300
It lets you know when you're ovulating.

01:08:57.341 --> 01:08:59.469
It's been in our family for generations.

01:08:59.511 --> 01:09:02.848
And if you want to keep it
our lucky thermometer, don't ever wash it.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:10.522
-Julia.
-Dad.

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:15.986
You're gonna have to find
a new waitress.

01:09:16.944 --> 01:09:18.363
It's about time.

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.453
Come here.

01:09:28.915 --> 01:09:30.250
Hey.

01:09:31.126 --> 01:09:32.919
Take care of my daughter.

01:09:35.505 --> 01:09:37.631
All right.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:40.926
Goodbye! Best of luck.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.984
Hey, is it too late
to crash the Fockyerdoder wedding?

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:58.486
Bye.

01:09:58.528 --> 01:10:01.406
And we lived happily ever after.

01:10:01.448 --> 01:10:02.574
JULIA JONES'S
Diary

01:10:02.616 --> 01:10:06.161
But not before we went on our honeymoon
to romantic Kong Island.

01:10:21.384 --> 01:10:24.846
Help! Please, help me!

01:10:32.896 --> 01:10:34.439
Help!

01:10:34.481 --> 01:10:36.608
Keep the camera rolling.

01:10:36.650 --> 01:10:38.610
Oh, God.

01:10:38.652 --> 01:10:42.072
Help! Please.

01:10:44.783 --> 01:10:47.494
No. No.

01:10:53.291 --> 01:10:54.793
Carmen Electra.

01:10:54.834 --> 01:10:58.129
Carmen Electra! Carmen Electra!

01:10:58.171 --> 01:11:01.716
Carmen Electra! Carmen Electra!

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:04.302
That feels kind of good.

01:11:04.344 --> 01:11:06.012
A little kinky.

01:11:08.056 --> 01:11:10.767
Oh, yeah.

01:11:11.851 --> 01:11:13.728
BIG ASS
DRINK

01:11:14.729 --> 01:11:16.272
I like hairy boys.

01:11:40.714 --> 01:11:42.924
Yes! Yes!

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.970
Yes!

01:11:47.012 --> 01:11:48.430
Yes!

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:49.889
Beautiful.

01:11:49.931 --> 01:11:51.349
Yes, drink it.

01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:54.060
Tell you, you're gonna love that.

01:11:54.102 --> 01:11:56.980
Is that Cos' hand on your booty?

01:12:01.860 --> 01:12:03.445
Cut it.

01:12:05.238 --> 01:12:07.198
I'm kind of an amateur tennis player...

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:09.868
...and I was playing
and it was a drizzly day...

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:13.955
...and Roz came down and volunteered
to hold my balls and keep them dry.

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:15.915
-His balls--
-We got rained out anyway.

01:12:15.957 --> 01:12:18.918
His balls are always wet,
whether it's raining or not.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.475
Hey, is it too late for one more parody?

01:12:34.934 --> 01:12:40.106
It's on the Hudson with
breathtaking views of the skyline.

01:12:41.816 --> 01:12:43.818
Yeah! What?

01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:45.403
Okay!

01:12:45.445 --> 01:12:46.863
Get crunk!

01:12:46.905 --> 01:12:49.532
We say a little prayer for you.

01:13:18.353 --> 01:13:19.521
Infantilism.

01:14:36.514 --> 01:14:38.808
How often do you have sex?

01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:41.269
I don't understand the question.

01:14:41.311 --> 01:14:43.688
I mean, it's a PG-13 movie.

01:14:43.730 --> 01:14:47.442
We're limited to very mild
sexual content.

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:49.819
Above the waist...

01:14:50.653 --> 01:14:54.574
-...over the shirts, no tongues.
-No tongue.

01:14:54.616 --> 01:14:56.743
How about this week?

01:14:59.537 --> 01:15:01.080
A hundred and twenty-seven.
