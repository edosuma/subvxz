WEBVTT

00:25.700 --> 00:27.327
Five minutes,
my little lambs.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.201
Has anyone seen
Bliss Cavendar?

00:32.707 --> 00:34.834
Pash, this can't
be happening.

00:36.678 --> 00:38.202
Why aren't you
backstage, Brooke?

00:38.280 --> 00:39.508
You know how it is.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.742
They get to a certain age,
they don't want you back there.

00:43.518 --> 00:44.712
She said
she'll meet me here.

00:44.786 --> 00:46.720
Really? That's odd.

00:48.890 --> 00:51.415
It says "temporary."

00:51.960 --> 00:53.086
It did a minute ago,
I swear.

00:53.194 --> 00:54.957
My mom is
gonna kill me.

00:59.234 --> 01:00.633
Now, Miss Amber Black

01:02.137 --> 01:06.574
If I could have dinner with
anyone, it would have to be God.

01:07.375 --> 01:10.867
Because what they say
is true. God is great.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.114
Don't tell them
that I did it, okay?

01:16.217 --> 01:17.878
Those are the rules,
you're not allowed to tell.

01:19.421 --> 01:22.390
Let go.
I'm your only friend.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.322
Corbi Booth,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:24.426 --> 01:27.987
If I could have dinner with anyone,
it would have to be my grandfather.

01:29.397 --> 01:30.591
I love you, Papa.

01:34.169 --> 01:37.661
And now, also from Bodeen,
Miss Bliss Cavendar.

01:59.526 --> 02:02.518
If I could have
dinner with anyone,

02:04.331 --> 02:06.196
it would be
Amelia Earhart,

02:07.368 --> 02:11.031
because not only was she
a pioneer of aviation,

02:11.138 --> 02:15.131
but she was a great woman in history.

02:17.378 --> 02:18.709
Thank you.

02:25.619 --> 02:28.213
So enlighten me What was
that little stunt all about?

02:28.455 --> 02:30.150
Are you trying to
sabotage your chances?

02:30.224 --> 02:33.057
Or was it just your biological urge to
make your mother look like a jackass?

02:33.160 --> 02:34.218
It was just a dare.

02:34.328 --> 02:36.956
How did that
work out for you?

02:37.531 --> 02:38.793
Not so great?

02:39.066 --> 02:40.465
Corbi

02:40.834 --> 02:43.632
Congratulations, honey
Well-deserved.

02:44.405 --> 02:46.498
Thank you.
Thumbs way up.

02:47.007 --> 02:49.407
Thank you,
Mrs. Cavendar.

02:49.743 --> 02:52.644
Bliss is so hard
to beat. Usually.

02:52.713 --> 02:56.479
Well, the Blue Bonnet pageant
is right around the corner.

02:56.550 --> 02:59.018
And we'll be there.
Come on, honey.

02:59.153 --> 03:01.018
See you later
See you.

03:04.525 --> 03:06.857
I'm sorry that
these pageants

03:06.927 --> 03:09.521
don't live up to your high
moral standards, Bliss,

03:10.030 --> 03:12.055
but there's a lot you
can learn from them,

03:12.166 --> 03:14.066
no matter what you
go on to be in life.

03:14.168 --> 03:17.365
You think you're being
judged up there on that stage,

03:17.438 --> 03:19.406
but no one's asking you
to be Miss America.

03:19.506 --> 03:20.996
I wanna be Miss America.

03:21.075 --> 03:23.168
And you're gonna be the
best one ever, sweetheart.

03:23.243 --> 03:24.369
Teeth.

03:27.047 --> 03:28.036
Eyes.

03:33.854 --> 03:37.187
Trudy, bless your heart
for fitting us in.

03:37.958 --> 03:40.586
Well, hell.
Shit happens.

03:41.095 --> 03:42.426
Let me get my foils.

03:43.564 --> 03:46.795
Now, what were you
thinking, getting blue hair?

03:47.468 --> 03:48.867
Fourteenth
drive in the red zone.

03:48.936 --> 03:51.632
They have now given up
nine touchdowns

03:51.739 --> 03:53.798
and three field goals. We'll
see how this one ends up.

03:53.907 --> 03:56.637
He's only had one take away
in the red zone.

03:58.645 --> 04:00.613
Hey.

04:01.882 --> 04:03.144
I won another one.

04:03.417 --> 04:06.079
Lord, child,
you are unstoppable.

04:06.553 --> 04:08.748
And had I known what you were up
to, I would have bought a ticket.

04:08.822 --> 04:09.789
Earl.

04:09.890 --> 04:12.484
I mean, dang it, girl,
what has gotten into you?

04:12.960 --> 04:14.484
Just defective, I guess.

04:15.229 --> 04:17.094
Nice parenting, Earl

04:17.164 --> 04:18.495
Come on, now

04:22.435 --> 04:24.164
I'll see you later

04:25.571 --> 04:26.765
Dinner.

04:34.013 --> 04:37.505
Seriously, out of all the
places to go to in the world,

04:37.617 --> 04:39.016
who would come to Bodeen?

04:39.585 --> 04:40.950
Them
I mean, they're smart,

04:41.020 --> 04:42.612
at least they just
pass through.

04:42.688 --> 04:44.121
Go ahead
and mock it.

04:44.190 --> 04:47.455
But without the Blue Bonnet
factory, this town wouldn't exist.

04:47.527 --> 04:49.757
You know what, Birdman,

04:49.829 --> 04:53.321
I think I preferred you
before you got promoted.

04:53.666 --> 04:57.158
You know, now
you're all corporate.

04:57.270 --> 04:59.864
I know. I miss the old Birdman. Yeah.

04:59.972 --> 05:03.874
Ladies, don't let the tie
fool you. I'm still one of us.

05:04.377 --> 05:07.778
But y'all are gonna have to
start calling me Dwayne now.

05:07.847 --> 05:09.712
It's more dignified.
No.

05:10.950 --> 05:14.113
Birdman is the only thing
you have going for you.

05:14.220 --> 05:16.313
That's what you think.

05:18.891 --> 05:20.358
Really?

05:20.459 --> 05:21.551
Yeah.

05:24.397 --> 05:25.386
Hey

05:26.165 --> 05:28.895
Make sure they
tip you this time.

05:41.647 --> 05:43.877
Hey, what can I
get you guys?

05:44.350 --> 05:45.510
Hey, Corbi

05:45.585 --> 05:48.816
So what are you, like,
alternative now?

05:49.922 --> 05:51.685
Alternative to what?

05:51.757 --> 05:55.022
What's the name of that thing that
if I eat it real fast, it's free?

05:55.094 --> 05:58.427
That's the Squealer. You have to
eat it in three minutes or less.

06:01.534 --> 06:04.196
Yeah, you bring me
a Squealer.

06:04.570 --> 06:05.537
And I don't mean Corbi.

06:09.942 --> 06:12.877
Let's go, buddy, pick
it up Come on, come on.

06:12.945 --> 06:14.412
Yes, you got it, you got it.

06:14.513 --> 06:17.346
I can't believe you
used to share a bed with her.

06:19.585 --> 06:22.383
You make it sound very dirty.
It was just sleepovers.

06:22.455 --> 06:24.446
Come on! Come on!
Baby, do it. Do it.

06:26.225 --> 06:28.022
Come on, Colby! Yeah!

06:28.094 --> 06:30.528
That's my man.
Come on, Colby.

06:33.399 --> 06:36.391
It's free, bitches!
It's free! It's free!

06:49.415 --> 06:50.643
I was thinking

06:52.251 --> 06:55.618
maybe we could go to
Austin and do some shopping.

06:57.089 --> 06:58.078
Really?

06:58.156 --> 07:01.387
Teach them well and
let them lead the way

07:01.626 --> 07:06.620
Show them all the beauty
they possess inside

07:08.233 --> 07:12.829
...them a sense of pride
to make It easier

07:16.775 --> 07:18.140
You hate them.

07:18.243 --> 07:22.509
Well, they don't have duct tape
on them That's an improvement.

07:25.016 --> 07:26.142
Hi

07:27.819 --> 07:29.013
Thanks.

07:32.490 --> 07:33.957
Pretty vases.

07:36.861 --> 07:38.954
They're great
for tulips, really.

07:48.807 --> 07:51.139
Thank you. Yup,
I changed my mind.

07:51.810 --> 07:53.835
- No, please, Bliss.
- Come on.

07:54.212 --> 07:57.375
Don't...
Don't be embarrassed.

07:57.482 --> 07:58.471
It's funny.

07:58.550 --> 08:01.883
I'm supposed to buy you
shoes from a head shop?

08:02.520 --> 08:05.011
Does that really strike you
as responsible parenting?

08:05.123 --> 08:08.559
Fine 'cause shoes
are a gateway drug.

08:08.693 --> 08:09.887
For gosh sakes, Bliss.

08:11.396 --> 08:13.728
It goes out
of bounds near the 42 yard line.

08:13.832 --> 08:15.561
There is a flag down.

08:15.667 --> 08:17.862
- Yeah, it's Earl.
- Hello, Earl

08:17.969 --> 08:19.664
Can you please explain
to your daughter

08:19.738 --> 08:23.139
why it's inappropriate to
buy shoes in a head shop?

08:24.009 --> 08:25.169
Dad, it's not like that

08:25.243 --> 08:27.370
You took your
mother to a head shop?

08:27.479 --> 08:28.503
Are you off your nut?

08:28.580 --> 08:30.980
You know, if she wasn't
here and I used my own money,

08:31.082 --> 08:33.346
it wouldn't make a difference
That's not the point.

08:33.418 --> 08:36.818
Look, I am in the middle
of a deal here, okay?

08:36.888 --> 08:40.085
So whatever you all
work out is fine with me.

08:40.191 --> 08:41.215
- Give me that
- Okay?

08:41.326 --> 08:43.885
Earl, do you know
how hard I have worked

08:43.995 --> 08:45.929
to raise these girls in
a drug-free environment?

08:46.031 --> 08:47.498
- Yes, I do.
- Exactly.

09:03.281 --> 09:05.841
Hi.
Hey, girls. What's up?

09:06.117 --> 09:08.176
Hello.
Dropping my flyers off.

09:08.253 --> 09:10.881
- Perfect.
- Hurl Scouts-Holy Rollers.

09:14.092 --> 09:16.026
- See you then
- Thanks, girls. Bye.

09:29.641 --> 09:32.474
Come on All right,
let's go. Come on.

09:57.134 --> 10:00.297
Screw you and your
grandma's Chevy Celebrity.

10:05.676 --> 10:06.768
Here.

10:08.846 --> 10:10.905
No, what are you doing?
Yes, yes, yes you got stiffed

10:10.981 --> 10:12.175
on your tips again, just take it. No.

10:12.282 --> 10:14.341
- Just take it, take it.
- No.

10:17.488 --> 10:20.685
What is this?

10:22.926 --> 10:24.359
Roller derby?

10:25.462 --> 10:27.623
This is...
This is tomorrow.

10:28.799 --> 10:30.790
This is in Austin.

10:30.868 --> 10:32.358
Yeah, I know.

10:33.437 --> 10:35.871
Will there be
cute boys there?

10:38.709 --> 10:42.770
Hey, Mom, Dad. Ee're gonna
go to a football game.

10:44.314 --> 10:45.975
It's an away game, but...

10:46.049 --> 10:48.381
The team
kind of needs us.

10:48.485 --> 10:50.817
No, not "kind of," they do.

10:50.888 --> 10:52.014
Well, sure

10:52.723 --> 10:54.520
Hey, I'll tell you what,
I'll take you.

10:57.494 --> 10:58.654
No, it's cool.
You have your car.

10:58.729 --> 11:00.788
Yeah, I have my car.

11:00.864 --> 11:04.027
No, but I mean, you know,
we can watch together.

11:04.134 --> 11:07.194
Earl, let the girls go on
and have their fun.

11:07.304 --> 11:09.499
And then you and I
can nuzzle.

11:21.652 --> 11:24.052
I kind of feel bad
lying to them.

11:24.154 --> 11:26.679
I don't. I give my
parents straight A's.

11:26.757 --> 11:28.247
I get freedom.

12:11.201 --> 12:13.134
Don't say I never
gave you anything.

12:42.932 --> 12:46.732
Okay, everybody, and welcome
to skate night at the Warehouse.

12:47.737 --> 12:50.171
I'm a little hung-over
tonight, so I...

12:50.273 --> 12:52.935
Anyway, let me introduce you
to our first team.

12:53.009 --> 12:55.739
Coming to you from
the streets of Austin,

12:55.811 --> 13:00.680
men, hold on to your
cookies, it's the Hurl Scouts.

13:00.950 --> 13:04.909
Number 99, captain of the
Hurl Scouts, Maggie Mayhem.

13:04.987 --> 13:08.753
Number 69, Bloody Holly.

13:08.824 --> 13:11.691
Number 3, Rosa Sparks

13:11.794 --> 13:15.696
Number 2, Smashley Simpson

13:15.798 --> 13:18.995
Razor Magee's Hurl Scouts have come
in last place three years running.

13:19.201 --> 13:22.864
This league has five teams,
each with their own theme.

13:22.972 --> 13:25.839
What outlaw do we have
skating against the Hurl Scouts

13:25.941 --> 13:28.000
this fine Texas
evening here?

13:28.444 --> 13:32.778
I'm talking about the girls so bad
that even God can't keep them in line.

13:32.848 --> 13:38.684
Give it up for the
undefeated Holy Rollers.

13:38.988 --> 13:41.286
Last season's champs
are led by their captain,

13:41.357 --> 13:45.225
the league's leading
scorer, Iron Maven.

13:45.461 --> 13:47.156
Yeah, she's the one
from the flyer.

13:47.229 --> 13:50.528
I'm feeling hot in these
polyesters right now, baby.

13:51.067 --> 13:52.295
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:52.368 --> 13:57.704
let's play some
roller derby!

13:59.508 --> 14:01.408
A jammer scores
a point in this course

14:01.510 --> 14:04.001
by passing members
of the opposite team.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.173
Maven gets a great jump.
That's fast.

14:06.248 --> 14:07.840
And she's out
to an early lead.

14:07.917 --> 14:09.509
Iron Maven,
ladies and gentlemen.

14:10.353 --> 14:12.981
Folks, the ones to watch
tonight are the jammers.

14:13.055 --> 14:15.353
Those are the ones with
the stars on their helmets.

14:16.425 --> 14:19.724
Some of you might remember watching
derby on TV back in the '70s,

14:19.829 --> 14:23.026
but it was reborn right here
in the heart of Texas,

14:23.099 --> 14:25.363
a true Austin tradition.

14:25.434 --> 14:28.198
Maven's heading up on the outside
but It's real crowded in there.

14:28.337 --> 14:30.532
That's a big
hit by Rosa Sparks.

14:30.606 --> 14:32.335
Jackie Daniels is down.

14:32.408 --> 14:34.899
Lucky for the Hurl Scouts
this is only an exhibition bout

14:35.010 --> 14:37.103
because the Rollers
are in control.

14:46.756 --> 14:48.280
Thank you, Maggie.

14:50.125 --> 14:53.094
I just wanna tell you all
that you're my new heroes.

14:53.361 --> 14:54.794
It's your
first time here?

14:56.030 --> 14:57.361
Yeah.

14:57.432 --> 14:59.263
Well, put some skates on,
be your own hero.

15:00.635 --> 15:03.570
The last time I wore skates,
they had Barbies on them.

15:04.139 --> 15:07.233
Hey, you know, none of us knew our
ass from an elbow pad when we started.

15:07.942 --> 15:09.739
You should come to
tryouts on Tuesday.

15:09.811 --> 15:12.245
You have to be 21.
You're 21, right?

15:13.581 --> 15:15.310
Two... I'm 22.

15:16.084 --> 15:18.985
Yeah, I just had my...
I had my birthday, so...

15:19.154 --> 15:21.247
Great, it's this
Tuesday at 5:00.

15:21.890 --> 15:23.551
It is?
Yeah.

15:24.426 --> 15:26.485
I'm Maggie,
Maggie Mayhem.

15:27.061 --> 15:29.552
I'm Bliss,
but I can change that.

15:30.231 --> 15:32.165
Yeah, you'll have
to change that.

15:32.801 --> 15:34.325
Don't be late.

15:34.736 --> 15:38.172
"Twenty-two.
Just had my birthday."

15:38.339 --> 15:39.601
Twenty-one,
it's a red flag.

15:39.674 --> 15:41.437
Twenty-two is way
more believable.

15:41.509 --> 15:46.003
I guess, 'cause you're not actually
gonna do it, so I guess it makes sense.

15:46.581 --> 15:48.071
Why don't
you and I try out?

15:48.149 --> 15:49.616
Excuse me?

15:49.684 --> 15:51.811
I didn't have a
Barbie-roller-skating phase. Okay?

15:51.920 --> 15:54.081
I had a fat-kid-sits-inside-
and-reads-a-book phase.

15:54.155 --> 15:55.315
You know that.

15:56.357 --> 15:58.791
Well, what makes you
think I won't try out?

15:59.994 --> 16:03.452
Because you'd
be scared to go without me.

16:03.531 --> 16:06.967
And those roller derby
girls, they're tough.

16:07.035 --> 16:08.935
And you are not.

16:09.003 --> 16:11.096
How dare you?

16:12.507 --> 16:14.532
Not to mention
your mom.

16:14.642 --> 16:16.132
She doesn't
have to know.

16:17.345 --> 16:19.210
You don't have
the balls.

16:22.317 --> 16:24.148
I can grow the balls.

16:35.630 --> 16:36.892
No way.

17:22.777 --> 17:24.506
Hey!

17:28.080 --> 17:30.174
Do you have room
for one more?

17:39.560 --> 17:40.891
I like your hair.

17:40.961 --> 17:43.794
Thanks, hon.
I do it myself.

17:45.566 --> 17:48.433
All right, next
stop, downtown Austin.

18:43.590 --> 18:44.750
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:44.825 --> 18:45.917
What's your derby name?

18:45.993 --> 18:47.119
Pocket Rocket.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.252
What's yours?

18:48.328 --> 18:49.420
Jaba the Slut.

18:50.364 --> 18:53.333
- Hey, you made it.
- Oh, yeah.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.162
Yeah, I'm glad
you came.

18:55.268 --> 18:56.428
Thanks.

19:04.211 --> 19:05.644
What is that?

19:05.712 --> 19:08.203
That would be Razor.
He's our coach.

19:08.682 --> 19:11.549
He's a good guy. And he
really knows his derby.

19:11.718 --> 19:13.310
All right, ladies.
Let's roll.

19:14.154 --> 19:15.712
Ooh, jeans shorts

19:15.822 --> 19:17.221
Every single day.

19:20.027 --> 19:21.722
Meet the
Manson sisters.

19:21.828 --> 19:25.161
Gift from the Ottawa Women's
Hockey League to the Hurl Scouts.

19:25.232 --> 19:27.496
They both seem
really aggressive.

19:28.068 --> 19:30.662
Maybe we can finally
win a few this year.

19:30.737 --> 19:31.897
Maybe.

19:33.507 --> 19:35.475
All right, listen up,
fresh meat.

19:35.542 --> 19:38.739
There's a lot more to derby than
fishnets and picking out a tough name.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.244
This is a sport.

19:40.347 --> 19:42.008
Now, the league
has six spots open.

19:42.082 --> 19:44.050
So whatever shred
of talent you have,

19:44.151 --> 19:46.915
hope you leave it out
on the track for me today.

19:48.255 --> 19:49.688
Okay, what is it?

19:49.756 --> 19:50.848
Sorry

19:51.425 --> 19:54.087
Just what are the rules?

19:56.029 --> 19:57.428
Derby 101, people.

19:57.531 --> 19:59.761
Four blockers from each team
are lined up on the track.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.162
Ten feet behind them,

20:01.234 --> 20:03.167
two jammers are lined up,
one from each team.

20:03.235 --> 20:04.532
We're the ones who score.

20:04.603 --> 20:07.572
First whistle blows
and the pack takes off.

20:07.673 --> 20:10.073
Then a second whistle blows
and the jammers take off.

20:10.176 --> 20:13.043
Some of us faster than others.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.770
Once the jammer
breaks through the pack,

20:15.881 --> 20:19.339
she hauls ass around the track
a second time and tries to score.

20:19.418 --> 20:22.251
For every player on the
opposing team the jammer passes,

20:22.354 --> 20:23.685
she gets a point.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.452
Most points wins the game
every single time.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.049
Now, line up
and get you some.

20:32.364 --> 20:33.558
Get up.

20:37.136 --> 20:39.104
Go, ladies!
Move it!

20:41.707 --> 20:43.231
Up, up, up, go!

20:44.910 --> 20:46.741
Looking good, Barbie.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.880
It's roller derby,
not cotillion.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.882
Come on,
put a hit on somebody.

20:56.822 --> 20:58.949
God damn it, Diane!

21:01.393 --> 21:04.328
Hey. That move will get
you tossed from a game.

21:04.430 --> 21:07.126
There's no place in
this sport for that.

21:08.834 --> 21:09.960
What?

21:11.070 --> 21:12.662
Okay, sorry.

21:13.739 --> 21:17.641
But I like the aggression.

21:19.345 --> 21:20.676
Is it bad?

21:23.249 --> 21:24.682
No.

21:25.484 --> 21:30.649
Forty-one, gotta improve
on that. 39. 32, not bad.

21:30.856 --> 21:33.017
Twenty-nine. Let's go.

21:37.196 --> 21:38.686
Twenty-three?

21:45.037 --> 21:46.766
Looks like you've
got some competition.

21:46.839 --> 21:50.297
Yeah, yeah, wake me when she
learns how to throw a hit.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.547
Or take one.

22:17.236 --> 22:19.568
Hey, you're
Iron Maven.

22:19.672 --> 22:22.539
That's right,
kiss-ass.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.703
Why don't you suck up
a little harder?

22:24.810 --> 22:28.712
There's still part of your face
that doesn't have doodie on it.

22:30.249 --> 22:31.978
- Nice shorts.
- Help.

22:33.419 --> 22:35.410
Can somebody help me?
I...

22:43.494 --> 22:44.927
Just kidding.

22:47.198 --> 22:51.225
Hey, by the way, you made
it, you're a Hurl Scout.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.599
Nice work out there.

23:12.590 --> 23:14.251
Your feet are on fire.
They're on fire.

23:14.359 --> 23:15.792
Seriously, look,
they're on fire.

23:15.960 --> 23:17.291
You're changing
your schedule?

23:17.395 --> 23:19.590
Well, I have to.
You know, for practice.

23:19.697 --> 23:21.858
Don't leave me alone
with Birdman.

23:21.933 --> 23:23.867
You can change
yours to mine.

23:23.935 --> 23:26.768
I can't. I'm actually taking
an SAT class, remember?

23:57.068 --> 24:01.129
Shania, I am not cleaning Salisbury
steak sauce off of that fringe again.

24:01.839 --> 24:04.069
Hey, I just wanted
to let you guys know

24:04.142 --> 24:05.803
that I'm gonna change
my work schedule

24:05.910 --> 24:07.241
to Mondays, Wednesdays,

24:07.312 --> 24:10.611
'cause I wanna take an SAT
class on Tuesdays, Thursdays.

24:11.416 --> 24:13.111
I'm impressed.

24:13.184 --> 24:14.446
Me, too.

24:15.353 --> 24:18.652
I like smart girls, that's
why I married your mama.

24:19.824 --> 24:22.156
Well, that and I
knocked her up.

25:10.074 --> 25:13.339
Shouldn't... Shouldn't we,
like, be practicing soon?

25:13.411 --> 25:15.379
Yeah, hurry up, you guys,
we don't wanna be late.

25:16.581 --> 25:20.175
Careful, Pee-Wee here might
get the idea we actually win.

25:20.584 --> 25:22.518
You don't?
Hell, no never.

25:22.586 --> 25:25.521
All that "We're Number 1"
corporate crap doesn't apply.

25:25.589 --> 25:28.023
Our bad attitude's
an asset here.

25:28.592 --> 25:31.220
Okay, ladies.
Check it out.

25:31.328 --> 25:35.355
Hot off the presses, brand new
playbooks compiled by yours truly.

25:36.733 --> 25:37.722
Your hands clean?

25:37.834 --> 25:39.563
Yes, my hands
are clean.

25:39.669 --> 25:41.899
Pay particular attention
to Play Number 3.

25:42.005 --> 25:43.996
I think it's gonna
blow your doors off.

25:44.074 --> 25:45.871
Smashley,
you're late as per usual.

25:45.942 --> 25:47.500
I know.

25:47.577 --> 25:51.536
Well, then you must also know that
there's nothing cool about being late.

25:51.615 --> 25:53.082
Hey...
Let's hit the track.

25:53.183 --> 25:57.415
Who's up for Lovejoy's later
tonight? $2 pitchers. Beer?

25:57.687 --> 25:58.745
I'm in.

25:58.855 --> 25:59.879
Me, too.

25:59.956 --> 26:01.184
I'm in.

26:02.592 --> 26:04.287
You weren't invited.

26:06.129 --> 26:07.619
I'm still in.

26:08.298 --> 26:10.198
There's no such thing
as a scrimmage.

26:10.267 --> 26:11.894
We practice
the way we play.

26:11.968 --> 26:13.401
Maven, you know
what to do.

26:13.470 --> 26:15.734
Bliss, show me
something good.

26:20.310 --> 26:23.040
You ready?
Am I ready?

26:25.215 --> 26:27.149
Let's go,
ladies. Skate.

26:28.485 --> 26:30.749
Don't block your own player,
let's go.

26:30.821 --> 26:33.119
Crossover the turn, stay
low. Crossover the turn.

26:33.223 --> 26:36.590
Bend those knees. Bend
those knees. Bend those knees.

26:46.603 --> 26:48.434
What the hell
was that?

26:48.505 --> 26:49.995
You had Maven beat,
but she smoked you

26:50.107 --> 26:51.506
'cause you're too
scared to throw a hit.

26:51.641 --> 26:53.131
And then you quit.

26:53.243 --> 26:54.676
I need you to
be a lot more...

26:54.778 --> 26:57.770
- I want you to start being a lot...
- Ruthless.

26:58.682 --> 26:59.808
Yeah.

27:01.017 --> 27:04.453
That's right, you little peanut,
I need you to be ruthless.

27:04.521 --> 27:06.512
This is
a contact sport, Bliss.

27:06.623 --> 27:09.456
Eventually I'm gonna
need you to make contact.

27:10.827 --> 27:12.795
- Next group up.
- Back off, Razor

27:12.863 --> 27:14.125
- Just ignore him
- We do.

27:14.197 --> 27:15.528
Seriously.

27:20.337 --> 27:23.534
I mean, he's right.
I'm not cutting it.

27:24.207 --> 27:27.540
You know what I like to
think about before every game?

27:27.644 --> 27:29.168
My ex.

27:29.279 --> 27:30.507
Little piece
of advice, Bliss.

27:30.614 --> 27:32.047
Don't fall for your
regional manager

27:32.149 --> 27:34.276
and think that he's not
gonna give you crabs

27:34.351 --> 27:37.718
because he cheated on you,
'cause it happens.

27:38.722 --> 27:43.216
And when I think about myself in the
shower, using that special shampoo,

27:43.994 --> 27:47.953
which, for the record, doesn't make
anyone feel very special at all.

27:48.031 --> 27:50.556
I really, really
wanna hit somebody.

27:51.034 --> 27:55.026
You have to find that thing that
really pisses you off and you use it.

27:59.208 --> 28:00.869
Have you ever had crabs?

28:01.644 --> 28:02.633
No.

28:02.912 --> 28:06.245
No, okay, my doctor said
it was really common, but...

28:11.854 --> 28:15.517
B- man, come on.
What do you say?

28:15.591 --> 28:19.254
Pash has to come. You
know, it's my first game.

28:19.428 --> 28:21.487
Yeah, well,
what about me?

28:21.564 --> 28:23.532
I mean, did anybody
bother to think.

28:23.599 --> 28:27.194
"Hey, Birdman might appreciate hot
girls in fishnets and roller skates

28:27.269 --> 28:29.897
"beating the crap
out of each other"?

28:30.406 --> 28:32.033
No, they did not.

28:33.175 --> 28:35.040
Do you wanna come, too?

28:36.045 --> 28:39.845
Yeah, but I can't.
I have a prior engagement.

28:41.684 --> 28:43.208
I'm covering for Pash.

28:45.087 --> 28:47.385
- Yes, we love you.
- Birdman.

28:47.456 --> 28:48.718
- Yeah?
- You know we love you.

28:48.791 --> 28:50.520
- Thank you. We do.
- You know that, right?

28:50.626 --> 28:52.856
Yeah, yeah.
Not enough.

28:52.928 --> 28:54.190
We're crazy about you.

29:00.469 --> 29:03.131
You can never have
too much eyeliner.

29:06.108 --> 29:07.598
Or Lash Blast.

29:08.210 --> 29:10.735
Here's a little gift
from the team.

29:10.813 --> 29:12.371
Safety is sexy

29:14.483 --> 29:17.748
You'll need these, too.
Those are just sexy.

29:17.820 --> 29:19.481
Guys, thanks.

29:21.490 --> 29:24.482
Let the bout come to you.
Let the bout come to you.

29:26.495 --> 29:29.123
So, are you ready
for your big debut?

29:31.900 --> 29:34.892
Has anyone ever thrown up
on the track before?

29:35.571 --> 29:36.663
Yeah.

29:37.773 --> 29:39.764
- Let's get them.
- Kill them dead.

29:40.009 --> 29:41.840
Skate fast, skate hard.

29:41.944 --> 29:43.070
I'm gonna puke.

29:43.145 --> 29:45.272
During the day,
they go by Peggy, Francine,

29:45.347 --> 29:46.814
Tammy, and Rachael,
but here...

29:46.915 --> 29:48.849
All right, let
the bout come to you.

29:48.951 --> 29:50.077
Okay.

29:51.020 --> 29:54.512
One, two,
three, kick ass!

29:54.657 --> 29:55.783
And they're off!

29:55.858 --> 29:58.952
Jamming for the Widows, Eva
Destruction against the Hurl Scouts.

29:59.028 --> 30:01.588
Bloody Holly who makes
her way out to the pack.

30:01.664 --> 30:05.361
And, oh, she passes the block
with a beautiful backward skating.

30:05.467 --> 30:07.298
But wait a second,
from out of nowhere,

30:07.369 --> 30:10.099
Eva Destruction shows up
right on her tail.

30:10.172 --> 30:13.005
Each girl the jammer passes,
they get a point.

30:13.108 --> 30:15.099
Pass a girl,
get a point.

30:15.444 --> 30:19.039
And she's gotten the first
seven points of the game.

30:21.016 --> 30:23.211
And the Widows
take the lead.

30:23.852 --> 30:26.650
Hey, Black Widows, my
spidey senses are tingling.

30:26.722 --> 30:29.213
About to make a sequel
in my pants.

30:29.325 --> 30:31.485
Yeah,
Spider-Man 3 and a Half?

30:32.827 --> 30:35.159
Yeah, it is three and
a half inches wide.

30:36.731 --> 30:38.028
Air trombone, yeah.

30:39.400 --> 30:41.391
Nice jam, man.

30:42.036 --> 30:43.196
That was amazing.

30:43.304 --> 30:44.362
Thanks.

30:44.739 --> 30:46.229
Yeah. Thank you.

30:46.341 --> 30:48.866
Where did you learn
to skate like that?

30:48.976 --> 30:50.466
Well, I once tried out
for the Olympics,

30:50.545 --> 30:52.740
but that didn't
exactly work out.

30:52.847 --> 30:55.008
You gotta maintain the
triangle configuration.

30:55.083 --> 30:57.984
I've been over it and
over it with you guys.

30:58.052 --> 30:59.246
What do you want
to do? Come on.

30:59.354 --> 31:03.222
I don't need to do the triangle
I need to get up there and...

31:05.093 --> 31:07.857
It's the second quarter
and we have Manson Number 1

31:07.929 --> 31:09.521
jamming for
the Hurl Scouts.

31:09.597 --> 31:11.929
This is a rough
contact sport.

31:12.100 --> 31:14.227
These girls are lean,
mean skating machines.

31:14.335 --> 31:16.701
And they gotta go fast if they
wanna get past the blockers

31:16.771 --> 31:18.363
who are trying
to knock them down.

31:18.439 --> 31:21.738
And by "knock them down,"
I mean "beat them to a pulp."

31:22.243 --> 31:23.835
Eva's gonna grab
another four points,

31:23.911 --> 31:27.540
bringing the Widows' score to
26 over the Hurl Scouts' 10.

31:27.615 --> 31:32.109
Team captain Maggie Mayhem doing the
honors for the Hurl Scouts, but...

31:32.220 --> 31:35.053
Getting Widows jammer Honey
Suck it back for that rail check

31:35.123 --> 31:37.717
and Whiskey sweeps Manson
Number 2 out of the way,

31:37.792 --> 31:39.783
making room for Honey
to widen the gap

31:39.894 --> 31:45.457
to collect another three points
there as we go into halftime.

31:45.933 --> 31:49.061
That makes the score 29-10.

31:50.571 --> 31:52.562
They say the Scouts have
the most loyal fans,

31:52.640 --> 31:55.905
and being the worst team in the
league, Lord knows they need them.

31:55.977 --> 31:58.275
Oh, Rosa Sparks,
no, you didn’t.

31:59.814 --> 32:01.145
God damn it.

32:02.483 --> 32:04.974
Okay, folks, the Widows
have a pretty comfortable lead here

32:05.086 --> 32:06.246
late in the game.

32:06.320 --> 32:07.810
Hurl Scouts coach Razor

32:07.922 --> 32:10.720
still sticking with Smashley
Simpson as the jammer.

32:10.792 --> 32:13.386
She's up against the Widows'
speed woman, Honey Suckit.

32:13.461 --> 32:17.295
The Widows' jammer
hip-checks Smashley.

32:18.933 --> 32:21.094
Well, our favorite
Whole Foods checkout girl

32:21.169 --> 32:23.501
is about to bag her some Honey.

32:25.339 --> 32:26.636
Clean-up on Aisle 5.

32:26.741 --> 32:29.505
With time left for only one
more jam, and the game out of reach,

32:29.644 --> 32:32.977
Smashley Simpson
is out of here.

32:33.681 --> 32:35.615
Okay, you're in.

32:36.517 --> 32:39.008
Show me why they
call you Ruthless.

32:53.868 --> 32:55.426
Go get you some.

32:58.973 --> 33:02.272
Okay, Austin, get ready to
meet your newest Hurl Scout.

33:02.343 --> 33:07.781
Here she is, Number 22, the fastest
thing on eight wheels, Babe Ruthless.

33:08.048 --> 33:12.212
Babe Ruthless? All
right. Go, Babe Ruthless!

33:12.352 --> 33:15.344
All right,
it's the final jam of the night.

33:15.455 --> 33:17.787
I like the taste
of fresh meat.

33:18.458 --> 33:21.450
And Razor, with nothing
to lose, throws the rookie

33:21.528 --> 33:24.497
into the last jam on
her very first game.

33:24.564 --> 33:25.656
And dang.

33:25.732 --> 33:29.828
Babe Ruthless gets a double shove
to the rail served up by Whiskey.

33:29.903 --> 33:32.303
But she's back up
like a Weeble.

33:32.372 --> 33:33.737
Okay, okay, that's good.

33:38.912 --> 33:41.073
She darts down the inside
and heads towards the outside

33:41.181 --> 33:43.012
and makes a run for it
out of the pack.

33:43.083 --> 33:46.246
Oh, but here comes Eva
Destruction, still skating strong,

33:46.353 --> 33:48.583
hoping to ruin
Babe's debut.

33:48.688 --> 33:52.590
Ruthless is out of the pack. She's
coming around for her points.

33:55.262 --> 33:57.389
That's my best friend.
That's my best friend.

33:57.497 --> 34:00.557
Rumor has it that Ruthless blew
away the judges in speed trials,

34:00.667 --> 34:02.897
and you could certainly see why tonight.

34:03.003 --> 34:05.198
And now Manson Number 1
takes out Eva.

34:05.272 --> 34:07.206
Feeling the heat
Ruthless is bringing,

34:07.274 --> 34:09.105
and she gets through
for the score.

34:10.409 --> 34:12.605
And Ruthless
gets four points.

34:13.380 --> 34:14.540
Go, Babe Ruthless!

34:14.614 --> 34:16.547
Babe Ruthless scored the
last four points of the game,

34:16.616 --> 34:19.516
but the Widows
take this one home.

34:19.585 --> 34:21.076
Congratulations,
you still suck.

34:22.789 --> 34:26.520
That's great. Celebrate
mediocrity, that's fantastic.

34:26.592 --> 34:28.083
Yeah, it's all a big joke.

34:28.194 --> 34:29.217
We came second.

34:29.295 --> 34:31.525
We came second.
You came second.

34:31.598 --> 34:34.465
We came in second
out of two teams. Nice.

34:35.135 --> 34:37.797
We're
number 2, we're number 2.

34:37.904 --> 34:40.565
We're number 2.
We're number 2.

34:40.639 --> 34:42.733
Razor, come on you did good.

34:42.809 --> 34:44.106
Well, I didn't
throw up.

34:44.210 --> 34:45.404
That'll do.
Good thing.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.907
Oh, my God I take back what I
said about you not being tough.

34:50.984 --> 34:52.781
- You kicked ass.
- Really?

34:52.918 --> 34:54.944
- And I saw that guy you liked.
- You did?

34:55.054 --> 34:56.386
But then I lost him.

34:56.456 --> 34:58.651
- Bliss.
- Hey, Hot Tubs.

34:58.758 --> 35:00.919
Oh, I can't. I gotta
get home to my man.

35:00.994 --> 35:04.088
- No.
- Yes. Great game.

35:04.497 --> 35:05.657
Yeah, man,
that was good.

35:05.765 --> 35:07.130
What's Hot Tubs?

35:07.233 --> 35:11.499
Well, here at the
Warehouse, he's Johnny Rocket.

35:11.838 --> 35:13.931
But here he's
"Hot Tub" Johnny.

35:14.007 --> 35:17.238
Even though he's not allowed in,
we started calling him "Hot Tub"

35:17.310 --> 35:19.073
until he got us one.

35:21.348 --> 35:23.475
All right.
Check it out.

35:23.583 --> 35:25.312
No, that's the thing.

35:28.755 --> 35:30.586
- Coke?
- You swallowed?

35:30.657 --> 35:32.522
That's hilarious.

35:33.426 --> 35:35.018
Not in this lifetime, Johnny.

35:35.128 --> 35:36.755
Or the next one.

35:38.932 --> 35:39.990
Hey!

35:49.208 --> 35:51.267
What's up, ladies?

35:51.343 --> 35:52.332
Should we help him?

35:52.478 --> 35:55.504
Nah, that's her fiancé.
He loves it.

35:55.614 --> 35:57.980
- That's my fiancé
- Hey.

35:59.284 --> 36:02.515
You know, there's some stuff
I'm pretty sure I could teach you.

36:02.655 --> 36:04.520
Johnny.

36:06.492 --> 36:09.620
Y'all check it out.
He's not even in anymore, man.

36:46.031 --> 36:47.828
Hey, man, check this out.

36:47.900 --> 36:51.028
That's not a bruise.
That's a bruise.

36:51.270 --> 36:53.431
Yeah, you look pretty good
That's nice, huh?

37:01.447 --> 37:02.778
Pash?

37:34.480 --> 37:36.277
Nice choice.

37:36.381 --> 37:37.473
Yeah?

37:37.816 --> 37:40.307
Yeah, and I love
this one.

37:40.419 --> 37:42.785
So where you from?

37:44.423 --> 37:49.292
Well, I hail from the bustling
metropolis known as Bodeen, Texas.

37:49.394 --> 37:51.794
The tiny town, right?
Off of South 84?

37:51.897 --> 37:54.092
That would be the one.

37:54.166 --> 37:56.066
You live alone?

37:56.135 --> 37:57.432
Roommate.

37:57.503 --> 37:59.494
Me, too.
Four of them.

38:00.639 --> 38:04.632
Why Bodeen? If you don't mind
me asking what do you do there?

38:05.644 --> 38:08.238
By day, I work
at the Oink Joint.

38:10.149 --> 38:11.064
But by night...

38:11.065 --> 38:13.065
Oliver! Oliver!

38:13.352 --> 38:14.614
Oliver!

38:14.686 --> 38:16.085
One second.

38:17.122 --> 38:18.350
Oliver!

38:23.494 --> 38:25.860
Get your ass down here you left
Jasper's guitar in your car.

38:25.963 --> 38:26.952
All right, dill weed.

38:27.031 --> 38:28.089
Shut up, douche bag.

38:28.166 --> 38:29.497
- Nimrod.
- Tampon.

38:29.600 --> 38:30.658
Tool.

38:35.173 --> 38:38.802
What are you doing in approximately
five and a half minutes?

38:39.210 --> 38:41.144
No official plans.

38:41.212 --> 38:42.372
Great.

38:43.714 --> 38:45.875
I'll go bring
you something.

38:56.194 --> 38:58.788
There she is.
All by herself.

39:01.399 --> 39:03.230
- Hey.
- Don't fight it.

39:10.908 --> 39:12.671
Let's get a beer.

39:14.378 --> 39:16.175
Oh, my God.

39:17.582 --> 39:21.882
Okay, you can make out
with him, but that is it.

39:22.753 --> 39:24.516
Who are you,
my mother?

39:24.589 --> 39:25.749
Pash?

39:30.161 --> 39:33.426
Savage and I have been
looking everywhere for you.

39:33.931 --> 39:35.023
Yeah, I bet.

39:35.099 --> 39:36.361
My belly hurts.

39:36.434 --> 39:38.527
There's a storm
in there.

39:40.938 --> 39:42.701
It really does, though.

39:42.773 --> 39:45.901
Come on, hold on.
Hold on. Let's get this.

39:47.778 --> 39:49.211
It's cool.
I swallowed it.

39:49.280 --> 39:51.680
No, come on. Just stick
your fingers in your throat.

39:51.749 --> 39:53.717
No, you stick your finger
down your throat.

39:53.784 --> 39:58.744
Pash. Have you ever thought
about your parents making love?

39:59.724 --> 40:01.419
Your dad's naked body?

40:01.525 --> 40:02.549
What?

40:02.627 --> 40:04.720
His balls jiggling.

40:05.897 --> 40:07.524
- Sweaty.
- No.

40:12.803 --> 40:13.929
That's not fair.

40:14.038 --> 40:15.130
Could you get me
a washcloth?

40:15.239 --> 40:16.365
Yeah.

40:18.776 --> 40:21.802
I'm sorry I ruined
your kind of date.

40:23.147 --> 40:24.910
But I want dirt.

40:27.551 --> 40:31.419
His name's Oliver.
It's a great name.

40:33.824 --> 40:37.658
Yeah, if you like wayfaring
Dickensian orphans.

40:43.334 --> 40:46.770
You're gonna have to roll over
you smell like a dead goat.

40:48.639 --> 40:49.936
Sorry

41:09.025 --> 41:10.424
Hey, girl.
How was the sleepover?

41:10.493 --> 41:11.790
Fine.

41:24.941 --> 41:27.466
Bliss, are you ready yet?

41:27.544 --> 41:29.603
The Blue Bonnet brunch
is in an hour.

41:31.881 --> 41:33.439
Did you forget?

41:35.185 --> 41:38.382
You think you have all
the time in the world,

41:39.723 --> 41:43.454
but there's not many girls who
are both smart and pretty like you.

41:43.526 --> 41:46.495
And I hate to admit it, but the
pretty part doesn't last forever.

41:46.563 --> 41:49.964
You got to make the most of
what you have while you can.

41:50.033 --> 41:51.694
Nobody tells you that.

41:51.801 --> 41:53.826
Mom, you're still
really beautiful.

41:55.405 --> 41:57.999
Save your sarcasm for later.

41:58.074 --> 42:00.042
How's your inspiration
speech coming?

42:01.244 --> 42:03.075
- I'm working on it.
- You want me to read it?

42:03.179 --> 42:04.976
- Not yet.
- Later?

42:15.725 --> 42:20.560
Bodeen, Bodeen,
Bodeen, Bodeen.

42:21.031 --> 42:24.398
Someone get me
out of here, Bodeen.

42:25.502 --> 42:27.527
It's depressing
in the sticks.

42:27.604 --> 42:29.697
I'm all over
these racist hicks.

42:30.740 --> 42:33.436
And I'm jonesing
for an Austin fix.

42:33.543 --> 42:35.340
Yeah. That's right.

42:45.622 --> 42:47.453
Oh, my God,
it's him.

42:49.259 --> 42:50.726
What do I do?

42:50.794 --> 42:52.694
Go ask him if he
wants a Squealer.

43:07.210 --> 43:08.734
Are you stalking me?

43:08.812 --> 43:09.972
No, ma'am.

43:10.647 --> 43:14.743
I happen to be here in Bodeen on
business craving some barbeque.

43:15.418 --> 43:18.216
And, yeah,
I'm stalking you.

43:22.759 --> 43:24.624
Okay.

43:25.495 --> 43:27.087
Can you take a break?

43:33.002 --> 43:36.300
You owe me. I wasn't even
supposed to work today.

43:38.974 --> 43:40.407
I love you.

43:50.752 --> 43:52.185
Is this you?

43:56.258 --> 44:00.752
Technically, it's my brother's
band. But, yes, I'm in it.

44:00.829 --> 44:03.423
And I'll be taking
that from you now.

44:05.701 --> 44:10.365
Wow. From here it kind of looks like
you're wearing a Stryper T-shirt.

44:10.472 --> 44:14.306
Stryper? Yeah, '80s
Christian heavy metal.

44:14.376 --> 44:17.311
I mean, "In the name
of Jesus, we rock."

44:19.381 --> 44:22.373
Well, I suppose if
it's in His name then.

44:24.019 --> 44:26.715
What's this? What's this three
million five hundred and...

44:26.822 --> 44:28.380
Oh, that's nothing.

44:30.392 --> 44:32.656
- You wanna know?
- I wanna know.

44:32.728 --> 44:34.696
It's a little thing
called a high score.

44:36.131 --> 44:39.567
At just the right...
Go. Nice shot.

44:40.802 --> 44:43.362
Is this what you do
with all the girls?

44:43.539 --> 44:45.837
You take them here to
show off your skills?

44:45.908 --> 44:50.140
Yeah. And it
usually works, too.

44:50.212 --> 44:52.009
Oh, yeah?

44:54.383 --> 44:56.715
Maybe we should do
something different.

45:12.501 --> 45:15.231
I should probably
get to practice.

45:21.944 --> 45:23.377
Shit.

45:27.115 --> 45:29.913
I think I might
have lost my keys.

45:30.118 --> 45:33.281
- Marco.
- Polo.

45:34.790 --> 45:36.621
Marco.

45:36.725 --> 45:37.851
Polo.

45:38.293 --> 45:40.727
Marco!

45:40.796 --> 45:43.560
Polo!

45:44.800 --> 45:46.028
Found them.

45:46.101 --> 45:47.693
Cool, I guess
we can go now.

45:52.975 --> 45:54.067
Oops.

45:54.142 --> 45:56.201
I'm gonna kill you.

45:56.278 --> 45:58.143
I'm gonna tear you up.
I know.

45:58.247 --> 45:59.544
I am going to...

45:59.615 --> 46:01.947
I realize this.
I realize this.

46:04.219 --> 46:07.052
Holy crap, you guys.
We almost won that one.

46:07.122 --> 46:08.384
Yeah, almost.

46:08.457 --> 46:11.426
You know, Razor's play
actually worked.

46:11.493 --> 46:14.222
Man, maybe we ought
to learn new plays.

46:14.295 --> 46:16.286
What's up,
Hurl Scouts?

46:16.397 --> 46:17.830
That was so
good out there.

46:17.932 --> 46:20.492
It was really cute to see
y'all trying so hard.

46:22.770 --> 46:24.567
I hate her.

46:24.672 --> 46:26.640
- Bliss.
- Yeah?

46:26.741 --> 46:30.575
Remember all that stuff I said
about winning not mattering?

46:30.645 --> 46:32.237
Forget it.

46:32.313 --> 46:34.508
I wanna beat
that cocky bitch.

46:35.283 --> 46:36.409
Me, too.

46:42.089 --> 46:43.989
On my team. Yeah!

46:50.831 --> 46:52.856
Look what Corbi did.

46:55.002 --> 46:56.697
With all that
combined brain power,

46:56.804 --> 46:58.499
this is the best
they could come up with?

46:58.606 --> 47:00.301
They got
your freckles.

47:00.374 --> 47:01.602
That they did.

47:16.190 --> 47:18.181
Hey, are you all right?

47:18.959 --> 47:20.790
You can't do that.

47:20.861 --> 47:22.658
She just did.

47:22.730 --> 47:24.129
We deserve
better villains.

47:24.899 --> 47:26.127
Just a few minutes gone by,

47:26.200 --> 47:28.828
but the game is already
falling into a familiar pattern,

47:28.903 --> 47:32.134
giving the Fight Attendants
an 18-to-6 lead.

47:32.206 --> 47:35.801
Okay, ladies, we're getting
beat, but we got the playbooks.

47:35.876 --> 47:39.573
Time to show these Fight
Attendants a few tricks of our own.

47:40.514 --> 47:43.813
Let's run Play Number 3.
Stampede.

47:44.352 --> 47:45.842
Number 3?

47:45.920 --> 47:47.979
Yeah. I think we only
got to Number 2.

47:48.189 --> 47:50.487
Like, one and a half

47:52.259 --> 47:54.693
You didn't learn
a goddamn thing, did you?

47:54.762 --> 47:57.697
What's it gonna take for
you guys to pull it together?

47:57.765 --> 48:01.326
You know what?
That's it. Hold this.

48:02.937 --> 48:05.167
Did he just
take Number 3?

48:06.440 --> 48:09.432
Come on. That's all I'm
saying, just skate on through.

48:09.877 --> 48:12.869
Hey, what's up, Razor?
Ready to forfeit?

48:12.947 --> 48:16.280
Forfeit my ass.
Run this play.

48:17.284 --> 48:19.718
What do I look like?
An idiot?

48:19.787 --> 48:22.221
Anyway, I've got
my own plays.

48:23.190 --> 48:25.715
Here's $20. You know
how little money I have.

48:25.793 --> 48:27.624
You run the play. You don't
score at least three points,

48:27.728 --> 48:29.753
you got another 20 coming
at the end of the bout.

48:30.965 --> 48:32.557
Just run the play, Jeff.

48:32.700 --> 48:34.190
- You all right? Let's skate.
- Yeah.

48:34.301 --> 48:36.701
- Ladies, we've got a change of plan
- What?

48:37.571 --> 48:41.803
Hey, don't let that traitor throw
you. Let's hit him where it hurts.

48:42.443 --> 48:45.378
Did Razor just coach the other
team or did my peyote just kick in?

48:46.580 --> 48:47.945
I don't even know
what's coming on

48:48.048 --> 48:49.947
'cause I don't know what's
coming around the corner.

48:50.049 --> 48:52.540
Fight Attendants are
about to take on the sky.

48:52.619 --> 48:55.747
Whoa! Holy crap,
a 180 turn.

48:55.822 --> 48:59.986
Kami Kaze makes her way through the
rubble to score an easy four points.

49:00.093 --> 49:02.584
Fight Attendants, 22,
Hurl Scouts, 6.

49:02.662 --> 49:04.789
Is that Play Number 3?

49:04.898 --> 49:06.559
Works pretty well, doesn't it?

49:07.434 --> 49:08.765
You suck.

49:08.835 --> 49:09.927
You turncoat.

49:10.003 --> 49:12.836
Want me to give them
Play Number 4 now?

49:13.606 --> 49:15.597
No.

49:15.675 --> 49:17.768
Okay, take a knee.

49:19.913 --> 49:22.279
Okay, I wanna put what
just happened behind us.

49:22.348 --> 49:25.681
I know I've moved on. We're
gonna run Play Number 2.

49:25.785 --> 49:29.915
Fire and Smashley, you at least
know the first half of that, right?

49:30.190 --> 49:31.782
Yes.

49:31.858 --> 49:32.950
Okay.

49:33.460 --> 49:35.655
Then get out there
and get you some.

49:35.762 --> 49:39.163
Hey, Scouts. You mind finishing
your little Family Feud huddle?

49:39.265 --> 49:41.927
Survey says you're
wasting our time.

49:45.672 --> 49:47.367
Let's go ape shit.

49:51.110 --> 49:52.099
Yeah.

49:58.017 --> 50:01.180
Coming out of halftime
and an alternate universe,

50:01.287 --> 50:05.053
Coach Razor puts former figure skater
Bloody Holly in the jammer position,

50:05.158 --> 50:07.183
who launches furiously
into the pack.

50:07.293 --> 50:10.228
The team is on their game now,
pushing Bloody to the front.

50:10.330 --> 50:12.821
And she makes it through
Bitch and Cooke Flake

50:12.899 --> 50:15.800
grabbing a total of eight
points for the Hurl Scouts.

50:15.869 --> 50:17.166
Come on, come on!

50:17.237 --> 50:21.833
The Hurl Scouts are catching up
in points for the first time ever.

50:21.908 --> 50:23.876
As this space
oddity continues,

50:23.977 --> 50:28.004
Babe Ruthless uses
her speed to fly by...

50:28.081 --> 50:31.073
Oh! Axels of Evil
knocks her down.

50:31.184 --> 50:34.176
But she's back up. Here
they come around the turn.

50:34.254 --> 50:35.846
A choreographed move
from the Hurl Scouts.

50:35.922 --> 50:37.856
Has to be from
Razor's playbook.

50:37.924 --> 50:39.892
That makes
the score 58-58,

50:39.993 --> 50:41.984
a first in the history
of the Hurl Scouts.

50:42.061 --> 50:45.656
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but the Hurl Scouts are tied.

50:45.732 --> 50:48.223
We got a tie game
here, folks.

50:48.334 --> 50:50.359
Oh, but Smashley goes down.

50:50.436 --> 50:52.267
- Really?
- Bitch. What the... No.

50:52.372 --> 50:54.533
Ooh, watch out, Tammy.

50:54.607 --> 50:56.575
Here comes Smashley

50:56.676 --> 50:58.041
Get off me,
you psycho.

50:58.111 --> 50:59.908
We've got two girls
brawling on the track.

51:00.013 --> 51:02.880
I don't know whether to break it
up or break out the video camera.

51:02.949 --> 51:05.884
Hell hath no fury
like a woman fouled.

51:05.952 --> 51:07.078
That's not legal.

51:07.186 --> 51:10.747
By day, these ladies are your
favorite waitresses, nurses, teachers.

51:10.857 --> 51:15.123
But by night these girls give
the crowd what they came for.

51:15.795 --> 51:19.094
Smashley Simpson is out of
here. We're only moments to go

51:19.198 --> 51:21.564
and the Hurl Scouts have
managed to squeak out in front.

51:21.634 --> 51:26.230
We're at a 70-67.
Hurl Scouts!

51:26.805 --> 51:30.798
Okay, grab her wrists,
hold on tight. Go.

51:32.644 --> 51:34.271
Play Number 8.
You ready for the whip?

51:34.379 --> 51:36.074
Put your arm out,
I'll be there.

51:36.148 --> 51:37.581
It's the final
seconds of the game.

51:37.649 --> 51:39.913
Manson ramps Cookie Rumble,
and the Hurl Scouts attempt

51:39.985 --> 51:42.215
a classic move in derby.

51:42.287 --> 51:44.221
Babe and Maggie go for the
whip, and it's effective.

51:44.289 --> 51:46.484
Nothing gives you
speed like the whip.

51:48.260 --> 51:49.098
A whip!

51:49.099 --> 51:50.558
Ruthless is flying into the pack

51:50.629 --> 51:52.756
while her teammates are doing
a downright professional job

51:52.831 --> 51:56.961
of clearing the way. She picks
up one, two, three, four points.

51:57.069 --> 52:00.596
Break out
the merit badges. 74-67.

52:01.907 --> 52:03.738
The Hurl Scouts
have finally won one.

52:04.910 --> 52:06.673
Fight Attendants, this
is your captain speaking.

52:06.778 --> 52:09.440
It's gonna be a long, bumpy ride back
to Loserville. So if you have your...

52:09.514 --> 52:12.608
You win the game. If you
run the plays, you win the game!

52:12.684 --> 52:15.118
How about them Hurl Scouts?
Yeah, how about them Hurl Scouts?

52:15.187 --> 52:16.484
How about them Hurl Scouts?

52:16.588 --> 52:18.681
Touché, ladies.
Touché.

52:19.291 --> 52:22.021
We got to run the plays. We
run the plays, we win the game.

52:22.160 --> 52:23.525
- We'll do our homework
- Every time.

52:23.762 --> 52:26.856
There're only 10 of them.
It's not... Not rocket science.

52:26.965 --> 52:28.489
Let's get those
Holy Rollers!

52:28.600 --> 52:29.828
Yes!

52:44.883 --> 52:48.717
Murray. Murray.
Murray!

53:03.335 --> 53:08.204
Please tell me you did not
shove Corbi Booth over a rail.

53:09.174 --> 53:10.471
Actually, I did.

53:10.542 --> 53:13.705
Corbi has a huge
bruise on her leg.

53:13.812 --> 53:16.645
I know that you're just
too bohemian to care,

53:16.715 --> 53:18.342
but she has to
cheer tonight.

53:18.650 --> 53:22.017
And she's gonna go through
with it? What an athlete.

53:22.087 --> 53:24.317
I'd like to
speak to the parents alone.

53:29.394 --> 53:32.921
She's passing one, two,
three girls. That's three points.

53:33.198 --> 53:35.063
If you're still having trouble
following the game, folks,

53:35.200 --> 53:36.758
don't worry,
you're not the only one.

53:36.768 --> 53:38.429
We'll keep
track of the score for you.

53:38.537 --> 53:40.437
You keep track
of the fishnets.

53:40.539 --> 53:43.531
This is a whole new Hurl Scouts on this
four-game winning streak they're on.

53:43.608 --> 53:46.771
They ain't playing scared,
that's for sure.

53:48.680 --> 53:52.275
Number 22 pulls it off again,
earning another merit badge.

53:52.384 --> 53:54.113
Looks like she's on her way
to rookie of the year,

53:54.219 --> 53:57.382
and I can't think of anyone in
recent history more deserving.

53:57.456 --> 53:59.083
Oh!
They gave her the whip

53:59.191 --> 54:01.056
You wanted it and they
gave it to you, folks.

54:01.126 --> 54:02.218
You've been whipped.

54:03.628 --> 54:06.027
Nothing gives you
speed like the whip.

54:06.564 --> 54:08.225
And the Scouts,
they go for another one,

54:08.299 --> 54:11.757
inching even closer to
a slot in the championship.

54:34.892 --> 54:38.726
So my brother's been
working on some dates.

54:38.829 --> 54:42.390
And it looks like this tour
thing is actually gonna happen.

54:43.834 --> 54:45.495
That's really great.

54:45.603 --> 54:46.968
Yeah, I guess.

54:47.404 --> 54:51.431
Thirty-four days crammed into a
crappy van with four other dudes.

54:52.143 --> 54:54.839
Like a bathroom on
wheels or something.

54:55.146 --> 54:56.408
That's a long time.

54:57.481 --> 55:00.678
No, it's cool.

55:02.653 --> 55:06.180
Look, you'll be doing your
thing, I'll be doing mine.

55:07.091 --> 55:10.857
It'll go by fast,
you'll see.

55:26.944 --> 55:30.539
- Hit it.
- Oh, yeah, baby. Yeah.

55:30.781 --> 55:33.511
Go, go, go, baby
Yeah. I love it.

55:33.651 --> 55:35.050
- Oh, my God
- Do it.

55:36.020 --> 55:38.682
No, I don't wanna
know, I don't wanna know.

55:38.856 --> 55:41.188
Blisster?
What are you doing?

55:42.860 --> 55:44.725
I'm watching the game.

55:47.798 --> 55:50.164
That's what I tell the folks
at work, I'm cutting out early.

55:50.234 --> 55:52.964
I tell your mom
I'm coming home late.

55:53.404 --> 55:55.736
Dad, I'm not
gonna tell her.

56:00.578 --> 56:03.672
Why do you feel like
you have to lie to her?

56:08.586 --> 56:10.713
You gotta pick your
battles with your mother

56:10.821 --> 56:13.984
because she is a fighter.

56:16.527 --> 56:20.691
This Blue Bonnet deal
means so much to her.

56:22.266 --> 56:25.531
And I think it's really
nice, you going along.

56:28.839 --> 56:30.704
But you know there's more
to life than beauty pageants.

56:30.774 --> 56:32.571
You know that, right?

56:32.676 --> 56:33.700
I'm aware.

56:33.777 --> 56:35.870
All right.
I'll shut up.

56:38.215 --> 56:39.842
Can I have one?

56:40.617 --> 56:44.951
No, you may not, but you
can have a sip of mine.

56:47.590 --> 56:52.459
Oh!
He took it to him.

56:53.129 --> 56:55.962
That was a nice...
That was a good block.

56:58.101 --> 56:59.864
Since when do you
like football?

57:01.070 --> 57:04.096
I don't.
I better go.

57:13.883 --> 57:15.544
Hey, listen up. Just
a brief announcement,

57:15.618 --> 57:17.449
then you get right
back to your food.

57:17.553 --> 57:19.487
The championship bout
is November 12th.

57:20.723 --> 57:22.884
You got your flyers
right there.

57:22.959 --> 57:25.985
If the Hurl Scouts win
one more game, we're in it.

57:26.095 --> 57:27.460
Good luck with that.

57:27.563 --> 57:29.656
Now I'd like to yield the
floor to Miss Eva Destruction.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.434
Love you, Eva.

57:33.503 --> 57:34.834
Thank you.

57:35.405 --> 57:37.339
In the grand
derby tradition,

57:37.440 --> 57:42.241
as you know, the new poster girl is
revealed by a member of another team.

57:42.946 --> 57:44.675
Sorry, Widows.

57:44.781 --> 57:47.443
Suck on this, girls!

57:51.087 --> 57:52.520
Yes!

57:52.622 --> 57:56.023
Very cute.
Very cute indeed.

57:58.861 --> 58:00.795
One for our team, man!

58:03.533 --> 58:05.125
There she is.

58:05.201 --> 58:06.600
Yeah, yeah.
Make the face.

58:06.669 --> 58:08.000
Make the face.
Do it.

58:19.716 --> 58:20.978
Exactly

58:22.885 --> 58:25.615
Congratulations, Ruthless.

58:27.490 --> 58:28.479
Hey, Smash.

58:28.558 --> 58:30.048
What's up, Maven?

58:30.159 --> 58:32.150
- Hurl Scouts.
- What up?

58:32.228 --> 58:35.220
I just wanna congratulate
you on your new poster child.

58:35.331 --> 58:36.559
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

58:36.666 --> 58:38.657
Yeah, you worked hard
for that, didn't you?

58:38.735 --> 58:40.168
That's really
kind of you.

58:40.236 --> 58:41.669
- Hey.
- Hey, hey. Hey.

58:41.738 --> 58:42.864
You guys hang on a sec.

58:42.972 --> 58:44.200
That's okay.

58:44.407 --> 58:48.309
- It's just a French fry.
- Maven, man

58:54.050 --> 58:58.544
Yes! Yes!

58:58.654 --> 59:00.417
Ruthless, yeah.

59:01.424 --> 59:04.757
- Okay I love it
- I love it.

59:04.861 --> 59:07.728
I like banana cream,
but I like chocolate, too.

59:10.366 --> 59:12.596
Food fight!

59:31.253 --> 59:35.121
Gorgeous.
Just beautiful.

59:36.258 --> 59:37.520
How's your speech coming?

59:37.592 --> 59:38.786
It's good.

59:39.594 --> 59:41.357
Okay, turn around

59:44.466 --> 59:46.093
What is that?

59:46.201 --> 59:49.193
Oh, it's...
I tripped at work.

59:49.304 --> 59:50.862
Are you okay?

59:51.106 --> 59:52.471
It's a bruise.
I can handle it.

59:52.574 --> 59:54.735
It looks like it'll hurt.
It's fine.

01:00:10.092 --> 01:00:11.423
You got
to be kidding me.

01:00:13.295 --> 01:00:15.820
Oh, shit.

01:00:17.265 --> 01:00:19.233
This is
an important game, folks.

01:00:19.301 --> 01:00:21.565
This is the last game
before the championship.

01:00:21.636 --> 01:00:25.003
The winner today
goes on to the big game.

01:00:25.340 --> 01:00:27.638
And Ruthless is your lead
jammer and she gets through.

01:00:27.742 --> 01:00:30.233
And the Scouts
score four points.

01:00:30.345 --> 01:00:32.506
The Hurl Scouts have won!

01:00:34.850 --> 01:00:38.479
Listen to how high my voice
is. I need an hour of Oprah.

01:00:38.587 --> 01:00:39.733
I'm like a woman.

01:00:40.233 --> 01:00:43.115
I need a
white wine spritzer.

01:00:44.359 --> 01:00:46.190
By order
of the fire marshal,

01:00:46.294 --> 01:00:49.786
you are hereby ordered
to evacuate the building.

01:00:49.865 --> 01:00:51.662
Well, this
game is over, folks.

01:00:51.766 --> 01:00:53.961
The Holy Rollers are
already in the championship,

01:00:54.035 --> 01:00:56.367
so now the Hurl Scouts
will play the Rollers

01:00:56.471 --> 01:00:59.702
in the championship game
on November 12th.

01:01:00.208 --> 01:01:02.039
Come on, man, roller
derby is not a crime.

01:01:02.144 --> 01:01:03.338
Illegally filling
a warehouse...

01:01:03.478 --> 01:01:07.278
- ...with too many people is.
- Wait here, I gotta go find Oliver.

01:01:07.883 --> 01:01:09.680
Hey, hey, you two.
I need to see your ID.

01:01:09.784 --> 01:01:10.842
I was just leaving.

01:01:10.952 --> 01:01:14.217
Look, you can show me your
ID, or you can go to jail.

01:01:15.357 --> 01:01:18.485
Young lady, what was
that you just disposed of?

01:01:19.895 --> 01:01:23.456
Seventeen, huh? Don't you think
you're kind of far from home?

01:01:24.199 --> 01:01:25.496
That's why
I was leaving.

01:01:25.567 --> 01:01:27.057
Yeah, good idea.

01:01:27.702 --> 01:01:31.570
Hey.
Hi, come on.

01:01:31.673 --> 01:01:35.404
What do you say? Cherry Slurpees
to celebrate our last night?

01:01:43.218 --> 01:01:44.879
I gotta find Pash.

01:05:43.890 --> 01:05:46.654
Where the hell
have you been?

01:05:47.493 --> 01:05:52.123
We got a phone call from Pash's
parents at about 3:00 in the morning.

01:05:52.999 --> 01:05:54.591
That wasn't fun.

01:05:55.334 --> 01:05:57.734
This is your SAT class?

01:06:01.340 --> 01:06:03.570
Excuse me,
what are you doing?

01:06:04.644 --> 01:06:06.305
You can't do that.
I paid for those.

01:06:06.412 --> 01:06:10.109
Hey, you lied, kiddo, all
right? That dog ain't gonna hunt.

01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:13.683
Okay all right,
I screwed up.

01:06:14.687 --> 01:06:16.655
I get it, but what
was I supposed to...

01:06:16.756 --> 01:06:17.950
Was I supposed to
ask for permission?

01:06:18.024 --> 01:06:19.286
I mean, you would
have just said no.

01:06:19.358 --> 01:06:21.485
You're damn straight,
we would have said no.

01:06:21.594 --> 01:06:22.959
What do you think,

01:06:23.029 --> 01:06:25.429
that the world thinks of those
girls with all their tattoos?

01:06:25.498 --> 01:06:28.296
Do you think they have an
easy time finding a job?

01:06:28.367 --> 01:06:31.268
Or getting
a loan application?

01:06:31.370 --> 01:06:32.632
Or going to
a decent college?

01:06:32.705 --> 01:06:34.002
I think it depends
on the girl.

01:06:34.106 --> 01:06:35.801
Or finding a husband?

01:06:35.875 --> 01:06:37.206
No, you just limit
your choices.

01:06:37.310 --> 01:06:38.800
Seriously,
you need to stop.

01:06:38.878 --> 01:06:40.641
You really need
to stop shoving

01:06:40.713 --> 01:06:44.672
your psychotic idea of '50s
womanhood down my throat.

01:06:47.687 --> 01:06:51.145
And pageants? I mean, what
have they ever done for you?

01:06:51.457 --> 01:06:54.187
That's my point, Bliss!

01:06:54.293 --> 01:06:55.555
I didn't have a mother..

01:06:55.661 --> 01:06:59.062
...to navigate all my opportunities.
- Jesus Christ.

01:06:59.165 --> 01:07:01.998
I am in love with this.

01:07:03.870 --> 01:07:05.963
I mean,
don't you get it?

01:07:06.038 --> 01:07:07.562
It won't last.

01:07:08.074 --> 01:07:11.634
In two or three years, it'll
be over. This is a moment.

01:07:11.710 --> 01:07:13.678
Well, how great is that?

01:07:15.347 --> 01:07:17.144
You don't understand.

01:07:17.215 --> 01:07:19.479
You will when you have
to support yourself.

01:07:19.551 --> 01:07:20.813
I do support myself.

01:07:20.886 --> 01:07:22.376
No, you don't.

01:07:22.487 --> 01:07:24.250
You buy shoes.

01:07:32.097 --> 01:07:34.258
You're full of shit.

01:07:35.333 --> 01:07:36.698
You know what,
actually...

01:07:36.768 --> 01:07:37.860
Hey.

01:07:37.936 --> 01:07:39.699
Hey, you calm down,
little lady.

01:07:39.771 --> 01:07:42.205
Why don't you go back
to your turtle shell

01:07:42.274 --> 01:07:45.368
so you don't have to
freaking confront anything?

01:07:58.456 --> 01:07:59.946
You all right?

01:08:03.795 --> 01:08:05.592
I just don't
wanna talk about it.

01:08:05.697 --> 01:08:07.688
Pash, come on.

01:08:08.633 --> 01:08:10.760
You told me
to wait for you.

01:08:10.869 --> 01:08:13.064
I was so busy waiting for you
that I didn't notice the cop

01:08:13.138 --> 01:08:15.129
coming over to arrest me
for an open container.

01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:16.729
Shit, are you okay?

01:08:16.808 --> 01:08:18.935
No, actually I'm
not okay, all right?

01:08:19.310 --> 01:08:23.577
On top of everything, my parents
decided to put a GPS in my car

01:08:23.648 --> 01:08:26.310
so they can track
my every goddamn move.

01:08:29.321 --> 01:08:31.288
So what's your problem?

01:08:31.389 --> 01:08:33.913
Hope the joyride with your
boyfriend was worth it.

01:08:33.992 --> 01:08:37.051
Wait, wait.
How is this my fault, okay?

01:08:37.127 --> 01:08:38.425
I didn't put that
drink in your hand.

01:08:38.496 --> 01:08:41.328
You know what? I'm ecstatic
that you have this whole new life

01:08:41.433 --> 01:08:43.264
and you have all new
friends and it's great.

01:08:43.335 --> 01:08:47.430
But I'm trying to get out of this
armpit of a town just as much as you.

01:08:47.505 --> 01:08:49.666
And last time I checked,

01:08:49.774 --> 01:08:52.765
getting arrested is not
the kind of extracurricular

01:08:52.844 --> 01:08:55.573
that Ivy League schools
are looking for.

01:08:56.281 --> 01:09:00.944
Do you really think that this roller
derby career of yours is going anywhere?

01:09:02.252 --> 01:09:03.277
That's not what
it's about.

01:09:03.354 --> 01:09:05.015
Oh, yeah, right.

01:09:05.122 --> 01:09:06.680
I'm sorry, Pash.

01:09:15.667 --> 01:09:17.497
Thanks for
letting me stay.

01:09:17.602 --> 01:09:18.694
Anytime.

01:09:21.538 --> 01:09:24.633
That's Riley back there.
He's my little man.

01:09:27.645 --> 01:09:29.841
So that's why you never
come out with us?

01:09:29.948 --> 01:09:32.644
Yeah, he pretty much owns
my ass. Don't you, Rile?

01:09:34.786 --> 01:09:38.221
Okay, first stop, sitter.
Then the Warehouse.

01:09:48.899 --> 01:09:52.163
Ruthless, Ruthless,
Ruthless.

01:09:54.071 --> 01:09:55.868
Maven, Maven, Maven?

01:09:57.641 --> 01:09:59.575
Hey, guess how old I am.

01:10:01.645 --> 01:10:02.839
Twenty-seven?

01:10:02.913 --> 01:10:04.244
Oh, that's sweet.

01:10:05.916 --> 01:10:08.214
I'm 36

01:10:10.154 --> 01:10:12.349
Guess when I
started skating.

01:10:12.990 --> 01:10:14.423
I was 31.

01:10:15.526 --> 01:10:21.692
'Cause it took me that long to find
one thing that I was really good at.

01:10:25.069 --> 01:10:29.529
And you know what? I
worked my ass off to get it.

01:10:31.709 --> 01:10:33.176
Yeah, me, too.

01:10:34.578 --> 01:10:36.773
It's too bad
you're only 17.

01:10:38.916 --> 01:10:42.545
What do you think the league is
gonna say when they find that out?

01:10:42.619 --> 01:10:46.385
Or your teammates, when they
find out you've been lying?

01:10:46.457 --> 01:10:48.789
That's gonna be rough.
Maven, please. Look...

01:10:48.892 --> 01:10:50.359
No, you look.

01:10:50.427 --> 01:10:53.919
One day it will be your time,
Ruthless, but it's not your time now.

01:10:54.031 --> 01:10:57.967
And if I was you, I wouldn't even
bother lacing up those skates.

01:11:18.989 --> 01:11:20.081
Fuck.

01:11:22.626 --> 01:11:25.424
It's Oliver, I'm running
with the bulls right now.

01:11:26.630 --> 01:11:27.995
Hey, Oliver.

01:11:30.167 --> 01:11:34.160
I just need to talk to you. I...
I'm calling you from a payphone.

01:11:37.274 --> 01:11:39.071
Look, I've left home.

01:11:42.613 --> 01:11:46.606
I... You know, this...
I don't...

01:11:46.683 --> 01:11:48.981
I don't wanna do this
on voicemail,

01:11:49.086 --> 01:11:52.783
so maybe you can get me
on Maggie's phone.

01:11:53.857 --> 01:11:57.816
512-697-4998

01:11:59.296 --> 01:12:03.357
And then we can just... We
can talk later. Okay, bye.

01:12:07.271 --> 01:12:08.966
- Oink Joint
- Hey, B.

01:12:09.373 --> 01:12:10.533
Hey, Bliss.

01:12:10.641 --> 01:12:11.801
Is Pash there?

01:12:14.111 --> 01:12:15.635
She's not here.

01:12:19.883 --> 01:12:21.475
Yeah, okay.
Bye.

01:12:33.296 --> 01:12:38.461
If, you know, you hear a
hint of pain in my voice

01:12:38.534 --> 01:12:41.230
when I say that I've
lost my best friend..

01:12:41.337 --> 01:12:44.795
..to a gang of
roller skating she-males

01:12:45.408 --> 01:12:48.673
and that the only highlight of my
night was serving corn to an old man

01:12:48.744 --> 01:12:52.680
who can't even chew it,
then I'd say you're wrong.

01:12:55.484 --> 01:12:56.815
I'm happy.

01:13:13.202 --> 01:13:16.501
Okay, that was odd.

01:13:21.010 --> 01:13:22.534
Oddly glorious.

01:13:24.213 --> 01:13:26.078
Ruthless, what's up?

01:13:27.717 --> 01:13:30.948
I just had something
I wanted to tell you all.

01:13:31.387 --> 01:13:33.252
Seventeen!?

01:13:33.356 --> 01:13:34.550
What if you'd
gotten hurt?

01:13:34.624 --> 01:13:36.717
Her parents could sue
the league, you guys.

01:13:36.792 --> 01:13:37.781
I know.

01:13:37.894 --> 01:13:39.759
We're in enough trouble with
the fire marshal as it is.

01:13:39.896 --> 01:13:41.523
- Exactly.
- You know what? She can still play..

01:13:41.631 --> 01:13:45.089
..as long as she gets permission
from one of her parents.

01:13:47.236 --> 01:13:48.464
I can't.

01:13:48.738 --> 01:13:51.901
I'm not even living
at home right now.

01:13:51.974 --> 01:13:56.434
Well, even though you can't skate
with us, and you're a big liar.

01:13:56.545 --> 01:13:58.570
You're still
a Hurl Scout.

01:13:58.781 --> 01:14:00.976
Yeah, you could
be our mascot.

01:14:06.555 --> 01:14:10.286
You can't understand until you
have one, everything changes.

01:14:12.495 --> 01:14:15.089
Yeah, that's what
my mom always says.

01:14:15.498 --> 01:14:17.329
But you're not
really like her, though.

01:14:17.466 --> 01:14:18.763
Oh, I'm the cool aunt?

01:14:18.834 --> 01:14:19.960
Yeah.

01:14:23.506 --> 01:14:27.306
Why don't I just cut school and
hang out with you guys today?

01:14:28.644 --> 01:14:30.305
Bliss, I know what it's like
to wanna do your own thing,

01:14:30.413 --> 01:14:31.505
believe me, I do.

01:14:31.614 --> 01:14:34.242
But maybe there's
a way you can do it

01:14:34.317 --> 01:14:37.150
without making your
parents feel like crap?

01:14:38.187 --> 01:14:40.121
What?
I've just been thinking.

01:14:40.189 --> 01:14:43.852
I think maybe you're being a
little selfish with your mom.

01:14:48.698 --> 01:14:50.029
Okay, no.

01:14:51.701 --> 01:14:54.465
She's the one who has
been shoving her agenda

01:14:54.537 --> 01:14:56.767
down my throat
since day one.

01:14:57.940 --> 01:15:01.431
First of all, you're lucky
to have a mom that even cares.

01:15:01.509 --> 01:15:03.306
And just because
she's wrong about derby,

01:15:03.378 --> 01:15:06.677
doesn't mean she's wrong
about every single thing.

01:15:06.781 --> 01:15:09.978
And if Riley ever lies to me
the way you lied to your parents.

01:15:10.051 --> 01:15:12.519
He wouldn't even be able to run
away 'cause I'd break his legs.

01:15:13.888 --> 01:15:16.618
I'm just kidding, honey.
That was a joke.

01:15:19.361 --> 01:15:20.828
I am here for you,

01:15:20.895 --> 01:15:25.889
but just because you've found a new family
doesn't mean you throw the old one away.

01:15:37.412 --> 01:15:40.074
Have a swell day at
school, sweetheart.

01:15:42.584 --> 01:15:43.881
You didn't see that,
did you?

01:17:02.997 --> 01:17:05.329
Please don't
judge me right now.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:17.075
Whoever he is.
He doesn't deserve you.

01:17:19.681 --> 01:17:21.012
Come here.

01:17:25.687 --> 01:17:27.086
I feel sick.

01:17:28.456 --> 01:17:29.946
I know you do.

01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:42.100
I gave him everything.

01:17:42.636 --> 01:17:45.537
No, don't say that.

01:17:54.381 --> 01:17:55.871
No, it's true.

01:17:58.552 --> 01:17:59.712
I did.

01:18:29.082 --> 01:18:31.073
That's a lot to process.

01:18:37.424 --> 01:18:39.915
She was wearing
my Stryper T-shirt.

01:18:40.861 --> 01:18:43.091
I just don't understand
how he could do that.

01:18:43.197 --> 01:18:44.664
Your T-shirt?

01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:48.900
It's the only
cool thing you own.

01:18:49.169 --> 01:18:50.761
That you'd know about.

01:18:52.072 --> 01:18:53.437
Stryper.

01:18:59.379 --> 01:19:01.574
Mom, this isn't...

01:19:02.382 --> 01:19:04.850
This isn't working.

01:19:06.720 --> 01:19:07.914
I know.

01:19:09.089 --> 01:19:11.421
You just make me
feel so guilty.

01:19:12.793 --> 01:19:16.354
That's not what I want.

01:19:18.365 --> 01:19:20.265
I deserve it sometimes.

01:19:20.801 --> 01:19:26.899
Well, I know I can go
overboard sometimes.

01:19:28.875 --> 01:19:32.367
But when the person that
you love more than anything

01:19:32.446 --> 01:19:35.313
tells you
that you suck, it...

01:19:38.252 --> 01:19:41.915
If you want me to do the Miss
Blue Bonnet pageant, I will.

01:19:41.989 --> 01:19:45.049
No, no, no, no.
We're way past that.

01:19:45.125 --> 01:19:48.754
No, it's not a big deal. I
mean, we already got the dress.

01:19:53.667 --> 01:19:55.931
Don't do it for me.

01:19:57.137 --> 01:19:59.298
Fine, I'll do it
for myself.

01:20:06.780 --> 01:20:08.611
Look who's back.

01:20:09.616 --> 01:20:10.674
Hi.

01:20:18.190 --> 01:20:19.817
Glad you're safe.

01:20:22.295 --> 01:20:24.525
I shouldn't have said
those things to you.

01:20:29.001 --> 01:20:31.026
Already forgotten, kiddo.

01:20:40.980 --> 01:20:43.778
She's trying to
look pathetic on purpose.

01:20:47.953 --> 01:20:50.717
How long you gonna
hold onto that grudge?

01:21:01.067 --> 01:21:02.295
Thanks.

01:21:05.538 --> 01:21:08.063
Pash, I'm sorry.
You see, I just...

01:21:08.174 --> 01:21:09.664
Come on.

01:21:09.742 --> 01:21:11.073
I'm sorry.

01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:15.741
I'm really sorry.

01:21:16.916 --> 01:21:18.144
I know.

01:21:20.019 --> 01:21:22.419
Just keep...
Keep saying it.

01:21:22.521 --> 01:21:23.545
Yeah.

01:21:23.656 --> 01:21:25.021
Over and over
again, please.

01:21:25.091 --> 01:21:27.252
Yeah, I will.
I'll keep it up.

01:21:29.095 --> 01:21:30.221
So what happened?

01:21:30.329 --> 01:21:33.765
God, I just feel
like such...

01:21:34.266 --> 01:21:39.499
I'm stupid. I'm just... I feel
so stupid for falling for it.

01:21:40.373 --> 01:21:43.365
Yeah, that's why I like
a good fondling, you know?

01:21:43.442 --> 01:21:45.239
It's so much simpler.

01:21:46.345 --> 01:21:51.112
Well, while you were
off gallivanting, I...

01:21:52.618 --> 01:21:54.279
I got some news.

01:21:56.055 --> 01:21:57.852
What... What... What's...

01:21:58.290 --> 01:22:00.281
I got into some colleges.

01:22:01.794 --> 01:22:02.886
Wow!

01:22:02.962 --> 01:22:05.192
My parents want me
to go to Johns Hopkins,

01:22:05.264 --> 01:22:09.598
but I think I'm
gonna go to Columbia.

01:22:09.702 --> 01:22:13.763
I know. I'm gonna see what it's like
to live in New York for a little while.

01:22:13.873 --> 01:22:15.807
That's amazing.

01:22:22.248 --> 01:22:24.739
Do you still have
his stupid jacket?

01:22:33.959 --> 01:22:36.120
Did he turn into
a handsome prince?

01:22:36.228 --> 01:22:37.820
No, he stayed a Birdman.

01:22:38.497 --> 01:22:41.955
But the worst part is,
he's actually a good kisser.

01:22:43.335 --> 01:22:44.893
Really good.

01:22:45.004 --> 01:22:47.097
Congratulations
are in order.

01:22:47.173 --> 01:22:49.903
Uh, no. Let's not
encourage this.

01:22:51.009 --> 01:22:53.136
I like Birdman.
He's nice.

01:22:53.244 --> 01:22:56.941
Hey, Bliss, somebody on the
phone for you. A Maggie Mayhem?

01:22:58.149 --> 01:22:59.173
Well, look at you.

01:22:59.284 --> 01:23:00.273
I got a makeover.

01:23:00.351 --> 01:23:01.841
Yes, you did.

01:23:07.025 --> 01:23:08.185
Hello.

01:23:08.293 --> 01:23:09.624
Ruthless,
it's the championship.

01:23:09.694 --> 01:23:12.094
Don't even tell me
you can't make it.

01:23:12.163 --> 01:23:13.187
I can't.

01:23:13.798 --> 01:23:17.199
Is it her mom? Let me talk
to her. I'll knock her out.

01:23:18.169 --> 01:23:20.034
Just tell your mom
it's important.

01:23:21.005 --> 01:23:23.769
The pageant is the same day
as the game, and I can't.

01:23:23.842 --> 01:23:27.107
Well, you have to try harder and
you have to make it work. We need you.

01:23:27.212 --> 01:23:28.645
- Let me talk to her mom.
- Bye.

01:23:28.713 --> 01:23:30.647
I'll kick her in her...

01:23:31.783 --> 01:23:33.512
You're selling out.

01:23:49.634 --> 01:23:51.226
"Babe Ruthless."

01:23:52.303 --> 01:23:54.498
A classic
move in derby.

01:23:54.572 --> 01:23:57.632
Babe and Maggie go for the
whip, and it's effective.

01:23:57.709 --> 01:24:02.203
Nothing gives you speed like
a whip. Look at Ruthless fly.

01:24:11.856 --> 01:24:13.517
Excuse me, ladies.

01:24:14.158 --> 01:24:17.594
I'm looking for Maggie,
Maggie Mayhem.

01:24:22.433 --> 01:24:24.230
Good pageant, y'all.

01:24:27.772 --> 01:24:29.569
Love the dress, Amber.

01:24:33.845 --> 01:24:36.439
- We'll have to break through.
- I know.

01:24:36.614 --> 01:24:37.945
What time is it?

01:24:40.618 --> 01:24:43.382
- Your gown is custom, huh?
- Yeah.

01:24:43.454 --> 01:24:45.718
It's beautiful.

01:24:45.790 --> 01:24:47.087
Thanks.

01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:51.190
Your dress is nice
too Amber.

01:24:53.298 --> 01:24:54.629
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:24:56.434 --> 01:24:58.026
We need to talk.

01:25:03.541 --> 01:25:05.566
Ma'am, put down
the lip gloss.

01:25:05.643 --> 01:25:07.076
Step away from the mirror.

01:25:09.447 --> 01:25:12.143
What are you all doing
here? Are you...

01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:14.074
You're just springing
this on me now?

01:25:14.152 --> 01:25:15.642
I know the timing sucks,

01:25:15.753 --> 01:25:17.914
but I've been thinking. You
know, I'm not so bothered

01:25:17.989 --> 01:25:19.957
by her playing
this roller derby.

01:25:20.058 --> 01:25:21.548
In fact, I think
it's kind of neat.

01:25:21.626 --> 01:25:24.561
I went on the website, they got
Blisster's pictures all over.

01:25:24.629 --> 01:25:26.426
And it looks like they're
having a ton of fun.

01:25:26.497 --> 01:25:30.830
Earl, we just spent a lot of
money on a custom-made gown.

01:25:30.934 --> 01:25:33.425
And you want her
to just up and quit?

01:25:33.503 --> 01:25:35.937
Yeah, but her team is in
the league championships.

01:25:36.006 --> 01:25:37.769
The game's tonight.

01:25:37.841 --> 01:25:41.277
$800, Earl.

01:25:44.281 --> 01:25:46.442
I can take
losing the money.

01:25:47.351 --> 01:25:51.344
I cannot take losing the
chance for our kid to be happy.

01:25:53.490 --> 01:25:55.651
- I love her.
- Yeah, she looks nice

01:25:55.759 --> 01:25:57.192
- Really sweet.
- Bliss.

01:25:57.294 --> 01:25:58.591
You guys gotta
hide, my mom's coming.

01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:01.528
- Bliss.
- Seriously you guys have to hide.

01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:04.960
Bliss.

01:26:05.302 --> 01:26:08.465
Your daddy is about to come in here
and tell you that he thinks it's okay

01:26:08.538 --> 01:26:11.837
for you to go off
and play roller derby.

01:26:12.275 --> 01:26:14.004
- I don't agree.
- Mom.

01:26:14.111 --> 01:26:18.980
When you told me that you weren't
doing the Miss Blue Bonnet for me,

01:26:19.483 --> 01:26:21.280
did you mean it?

01:26:31.061 --> 01:26:34.553
Well, good luck.

01:26:52.683 --> 01:26:56.710
Come on, ladies.
What are we waiting for?

01:26:56.820 --> 01:26:57.809
Ready to play!

01:26:58.755 --> 01:27:00.017
Okay!

01:27:04.094 --> 01:27:05.394
Wait.

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:09.054
One more thing.

01:27:10.100 --> 01:27:13.194
- Yeah, come on, let's go!
- Good luck, Amber!

01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:14.498
Step it up!

01:27:20.677 --> 01:27:22.907
That's when...

01:27:23.013 --> 01:27:24.105
Hi.

01:27:27.551 --> 01:27:28.882
I got it.

01:27:29.786 --> 01:27:32.448
We just got back into town.
I came straight over.

01:27:32.556 --> 01:27:36.720
I probably still smell
like the van. But...

01:27:37.194 --> 01:27:40.721
I went on your website and saw some
girl wearing my Stryper T-shirt.

01:27:40.797 --> 01:27:42.389
Oh, that girl...

01:27:43.033 --> 01:27:45.365
She just climbed
into our van,

01:27:45.435 --> 01:27:48.029
threw on your shirt.
She was an idiot.

01:27:49.706 --> 01:27:52.402
You know, I don't
wanna be this girl.

01:27:52.476 --> 01:27:53.807
What girl?

01:27:54.544 --> 01:27:59.277
I don't wanna be the girl
that has to stand here

01:27:59.382 --> 01:28:03.478
and hear about what didn't
happen between you and some idiot.

01:28:03.587 --> 01:28:07.647
You don't. And this is bullshit,
anyway. I didn't cheat on you.

01:28:09.558 --> 01:28:12.994
But you never
called, okay?

01:28:13.095 --> 01:28:14.426
Okay.

01:28:14.497 --> 01:28:17.796
I know I should've called, but
there was no privacy in the van.

01:28:17.900 --> 01:28:20.391
And then I got
your message and...

01:28:27.676 --> 01:28:29.405
I would've called.

01:28:31.747 --> 01:28:33.942
My mom wants
her shirt back.

01:28:41.357 --> 01:28:43.291
That's right, I'm back.

01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:46.490
Thanks a lot for outing me.
That was a class move.

01:28:46.595 --> 01:28:49.689
I didn't out you.
I never said a word.

01:28:50.132 --> 01:28:51.793
I was just
messing with you.

01:28:51.867 --> 01:28:53.801
I don't wanna beat
your ass with rumors.

01:28:53.869 --> 01:28:57.134
I wanna beat your ass on
the track with my skates.

01:28:57.973 --> 01:29:00.203
It is
happening tonight, folks.

01:29:00.676 --> 01:29:02.803
There they are,
the coaches shaking hands,

01:29:02.878 --> 01:29:04.505
being nice and diplomatic

01:29:04.613 --> 01:29:07.639
right before the craziest match
that we will ever see here.

01:29:09.185 --> 01:29:10.777
Oh, I love it, Austin.

01:29:11.887 --> 01:29:13.115
That's right,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:29:13.189 --> 01:29:15.851
we're talking about the
one and only Iron Maven

01:29:15.958 --> 01:29:20.657
versus the upstart from the
heart of Texas, Babe Ruthless.

01:29:21.397 --> 01:29:22.557
Yes.

01:29:25.734 --> 01:29:27.998
Our jammers,
Ruthless versus Maven

01:29:28.070 --> 01:29:31.233
head-to-head,
the teams' two top stars.

01:29:31.907 --> 01:29:33.169
As they approach
the pack,

01:29:33.242 --> 01:29:35.972
Ruthless seems to be having an
easier time finding an opening,

01:29:36.045 --> 01:29:39.378
slithering through like a
proverbial snake in the grass.

01:29:40.482 --> 01:29:43.349
There's Babe Ruthless,
Iron Maven, neck and neck.

01:29:43.419 --> 01:29:46.183
They've been after each
other the whole time.

01:29:47.089 --> 01:29:48.750
That's a hip check
right there.

01:29:48.858 --> 01:29:50.758
You don't see Maven taken
down like that too often.

01:29:50.860 --> 01:29:53.192
Did you see that?
Call it.

01:29:53.262 --> 01:29:54.889
That was illegal. What
are you talking about?

01:29:54.997 --> 01:29:56.021
It's a clean hit.

01:29:56.098 --> 01:29:58.191
That was illegal.
Just call that shit.

01:29:58.267 --> 01:29:59.928
Calm her down.

01:30:01.103 --> 01:30:03.435
I'll show you ruthless,
Ruthless.

01:30:06.008 --> 01:30:07.532
It's the
second quarter, folks.

01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:10.909
We got Babe Ruthless jamming
against the Rollers' Jackie Daniels.

01:30:14.049 --> 01:30:16.176
Finally, I made it
to the promised lands.

01:30:16.252 --> 01:30:19.380
Okay, don't embarrass me now
that you're here, all right?

01:30:19.455 --> 01:30:20.615
Never.

01:30:23.125 --> 01:30:25.616
Go, Bliss Go!

01:30:26.228 --> 01:30:28.025
Go, Babe Ruthless!

01:30:28.097 --> 01:30:29.189
Go!

01:30:30.132 --> 01:30:31.429
Babe Ruthless
coming in to the pack,

01:30:31.533 --> 01:30:32.966
but she's having
trouble getting out.

01:30:33.068 --> 01:30:36.765
That tiny pipsqueak finds a hole,
but not as fast as Jackie Daniels

01:30:36.872 --> 01:30:39.306
breaks out of the pack.
Becomes the lead jammer.

01:30:39.408 --> 01:30:43.400
Rollers just picked up four more
points, bringing the score 24-11,

01:30:43.478 --> 01:30:44.968
Rollers in the lead.

01:30:46.447 --> 01:30:48.312
Slaya takes down Smashley

01:30:48.650 --> 01:30:50.447
Oh, but the Mansons
grab those wings

01:30:50.551 --> 01:30:53.884
and Smashley flies after
Slaya like a bat out of hell.

01:30:56.925 --> 01:30:59.257
You just
clotheslined me, man.

01:31:02.330 --> 01:31:04.992
Princess Slaya,
feeling the force now.

01:31:07.468 --> 01:31:10.335
That's gonna hurt tomorrow
in a galaxy far, far away.

01:31:11.606 --> 01:31:13.506
Listen. You play smart,
stay aggressive.

01:31:13.608 --> 01:31:15.769
Don't leave any holes for them
to slip through, all right?

01:31:15.843 --> 01:31:18.437
Bliss, this may be time
for Play Number 4.

01:31:18.513 --> 01:31:20.845
LBJ.
Knock them out.

01:31:23.518 --> 01:31:25.850
Coach Razor throws
Ruthless in the jammer's seat

01:31:25.954 --> 01:31:27.444
as she makes her way
through the pack.

01:31:27.655 --> 01:31:30.783
Look, she gets a hand from Bloody
Holly and slingshots out front.

01:31:30.858 --> 01:31:31.950
This could be big.

01:31:32.026 --> 01:31:35.655
And one of the Manson sisters
sends Maven hard into the rail.

01:31:36.531 --> 01:31:41.195
Maven can yell all she
wants, but she can't hear you.

01:31:41.469 --> 01:31:44.165
No, seriously, she can't
hear you. She's deaf. So...

01:31:47.041 --> 01:31:50.533
I'll tell you what. The Holy Rollers
have got to lay some hits on Ruthless

01:31:50.645 --> 01:31:52.510
if they're gonna have
any hopes of stopping her,

01:31:52.613 --> 01:31:54.945
otherwise she's
just too quick.

01:31:57.051 --> 01:32:00.487
All the Scouts dive-bombing
the Rollers, clearing the path.

01:32:00.555 --> 01:32:02.648
Not one schoolgirl
left standing.

01:32:04.559 --> 01:32:07.027
But we are tied as we
go into the halftime.

01:32:07.128 --> 01:32:12.327
Ladies and gentlemen, that
was a game-changing down.

01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:24.335
Okay, Razor, what's
next? Tell us what to do.

01:32:24.412 --> 01:32:27.677
We're gonna run Play Number
7, Rose of San Antone.

01:32:27.749 --> 01:32:29.307
Hey, Smashley, if the
play was called Bong Water,

01:32:29.384 --> 01:32:31.716
would you be paying
attention right now?

01:32:31.819 --> 01:32:34.083
You know what, I'm taking you
out and putting Ruthless in.

01:32:34.188 --> 01:32:36.588
No! My head
is in the game.

01:32:38.493 --> 01:32:41.087
Then get out there
and prove me wrong.

01:32:49.604 --> 01:32:51.868
Slaya hip-checks
Smashley into the rail.

01:32:51.939 --> 01:32:54.601
She's up and over
and she's crowd surfing.

01:32:54.709 --> 01:32:57.041
And Smashley Simpson
is back on the track.

01:32:57.111 --> 01:32:59.272
Slaya and Smashley have been
at this all season, folks.

01:32:59.380 --> 01:33:02.042
And it looks like Smashley
is speeding towards revenge.

01:33:03.584 --> 01:33:04.573
I hope the medic is ready

01:33:04.685 --> 01:33:08.086
'cause it looks like Slaya's
about to get a rainbow special.

01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:10.214
This game's about
to get ugly, folks.

01:33:11.125 --> 01:33:12.717
Walt, I don't
believe this.

01:33:12.794 --> 01:33:14.955
Smashley goes for the points
instead of the beatdown...

01:33:16.130 --> 01:33:19.621
...and picks up four for her team.

01:33:21.134 --> 01:33:24.467
Okay, we're running Play
Number 10, Pièce de résistance.

01:33:24.571 --> 01:33:26.232
Get back out there
and win it.

01:33:26.306 --> 01:33:27.637
All right.

01:33:29.709 --> 01:33:33.042
Let's go, you
know what to do. Get you some!

01:33:33.113 --> 01:33:34.580
The game's still
too close to call,

01:33:34.648 --> 01:33:36.707
but the Scouts may have
some tricks up their sleeves.

01:33:36.783 --> 01:33:39.081
Looks like they're
forming a wall. Kaboom!

01:33:39.152 --> 01:33:43.316
The entire Rollers team is
down as Ruthless flies through.

01:33:44.424 --> 01:33:46.756
Walt, out of nowhere,
Jackie Daniels...

01:34:15.188 --> 01:34:18.624
She's okay, she's okay.
That little munchkin's a trouper.

01:34:18.692 --> 01:34:19.920
Give it up, folks.

01:34:29.302 --> 01:34:32.135
Let's remember that
derby is a brutal sport.

01:34:32.205 --> 01:34:34.969
We've seen our fair share of
sprained ankles and broken bones,

01:34:35.041 --> 01:34:37.009
fishnet burns
and black eyes.

01:34:39.179 --> 01:34:41.306
It's the final jam.

01:34:41.381 --> 01:34:43.815
Two points
deciding Austin's fate.

01:34:43.884 --> 01:34:46.614
Let me hear you. Folks.
Give it up for these girls.

01:34:48.488 --> 01:34:51.321
It's Iron Maven
versus Babe Ruthless.

01:34:51.391 --> 01:34:53.621
Would you have it
any other way?

01:34:53.693 --> 01:34:56.958
The Mansons play Maven in the
middle of a patented cage move.

01:34:58.532 --> 01:35:00.830
They're calling for the whip, and
they just might get what they want.

01:35:00.901 --> 01:35:02.562
They got it.

01:35:10.477 --> 01:35:12.001
Go, Maven!

01:35:13.880 --> 01:35:14.972
Ruthless gets out first.

01:35:15.048 --> 01:35:16.982
And now as she gets a hand
from Bloody Holly...

01:35:17.050 --> 01:35:20.178
No, Maven sneaks out from the
inside and is heading for the lead.

01:35:20.253 --> 01:35:23.882
But wait, the Manson sisters
line up. A double leg whip.

01:35:40.073 --> 01:35:43.008
Ruthless is surging ahead.
She can taste the victory.

01:35:43.843 --> 01:35:45.834
But no!

01:35:45.946 --> 01:35:47.345
That's it.

01:35:47.414 --> 01:35:50.383
Iron Maven brings
down the anvil.

01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:53.283
The Holy Rollers
remain undefeated

01:35:53.386 --> 01:35:56.183
and are league champions
yet again!

01:35:58.757 --> 01:36:00.918
The Holy Rollers
are champs!

01:36:02.962 --> 01:36:07.296
Undefeated three years
in a row. Unbelievable.

01:36:07.399 --> 01:36:08.798
What a game.

01:36:09.702 --> 01:36:12.569
You gotta take your hat off to
both teams, ladies and gentlemen.

01:36:12.638 --> 01:36:15.801
As for the Hurl Scouts,
there's always next year.

01:36:17.543 --> 01:36:21.138
But this year it's a
three-peat for the Holy Rollers,

01:36:21.247 --> 01:36:23.442
once again,
three- time champions.

01:36:23.549 --> 01:36:24.709
I'm sorry, Razor.

01:36:24.783 --> 01:36:27.274
Sorry, my ass.
You were great.

01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:29.481
Still, who do they
love the most?

01:36:29.588 --> 01:36:31.419
Did you see
that leg whip?

01:36:31.490 --> 01:36:34.220
How about that jump
by Ruthless?

01:36:34.293 --> 01:36:36.659
Smashley's dive
was hall of fame.

01:36:38.163 --> 01:36:42.395
Yeah!Holy Rollers!

01:36:43.669 --> 01:36:44.761
We did it.

01:36:44.837 --> 01:36:47.328
We're Number 2
We're Number 2.

01:36:47.439 --> 01:36:48.633
We're Number 2.

01:36:48.774 --> 01:36:51.242
We're Number 2.
We're Number 2.

01:36:51.343 --> 01:36:53.106
Ladies, just seeing
you guys run the plays,

01:36:53.178 --> 01:36:55.510
I can't tell you how good
that makes me feel. It's...

01:36:55.614 --> 01:36:56.638
Razor,
are you gonna cry?

01:36:56.749 --> 01:36:57.773
No, I'm not gonna cry.

01:36:57.850 --> 01:37:00.478
It's just it's such
a long time coming.

01:37:00.586 --> 01:37:02.417
I think he might cry.

01:37:07.026 --> 01:37:08.015
Hurl Scouts on three.

01:37:08.127 --> 01:37:10.960
One, two, three
Hurl Scouts!

01:37:31.050 --> 01:37:33.951
Nice jump, Evel Knievel.

01:37:34.019 --> 01:37:35.281
Thanks.

01:37:35.354 --> 01:37:37.879
Maybe I'll teach it
to you sometime.

01:37:39.224 --> 01:37:40.452
Really?

01:37:42.895 --> 01:37:44.021
Okay.

01:38:04.316 --> 01:38:06.011
Listen, folks,
it's been another great year

01:38:06.085 --> 01:38:07.677
at the Texas Roller
Derby League.

01:38:07.753 --> 01:38:11.154
I've enjoyed the ever-loving shit
out of you I hope you have, too.

01:38:11.223 --> 01:38:14.192
Come out next year, and
we'll do it all over again.

01:38:14.259 --> 01:38:16.921
And if you would, this is
a residential neighborhood,

01:38:17.029 --> 01:38:19.395
so please don't be too
loud as you head out.

01:38:19.498 --> 01:38:21.864
And whatever you do,
don't drink and drive.

01:38:21.934 --> 01:38:23.925
All right,
thank you, Austin.

01:38:24.036 --> 01:38:26.027
I love you.
I'm out of here.

01:38:33.544 --> 01:38:36.911
This is your daughter's
playing card. Might wanna buy it.

01:38:37.014 --> 01:38:38.709
Actually, how
much are these?

01:38:40.218 --> 01:38:41.685
- 3 each?
- Yeah.

01:38:43.388 --> 01:38:44.548
It's a piece
of cardboard.

01:38:44.622 --> 01:38:45.884
Yeah, they support the...

01:38:45.957 --> 01:38:47.254
- How much for the shirt?
- Earl.

01:38:57.635 --> 01:39:01.127
I'll tell you what, kiddo, I've
seen some ballgames in my time,

01:39:01.239 --> 01:39:05.141
but this...
This was even better.

01:39:23.828 --> 01:39:26.820
I really didn't think
you were going to come.

01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:31.561
I'm really glad you did.

01:39:33.671 --> 01:39:35.161
That was scary.

01:39:38.242 --> 01:39:39.334
I...

01:39:40.511 --> 01:39:43.503
I can't change what
you're gonna do, can I?

01:39:48.186 --> 01:39:52.088
Probably not.
I really wanna do this.

01:39:53.191 --> 01:39:55.489
I want to move to Austin,

01:39:56.594 --> 01:39:59.688
and I need to know
that you can accept that.

01:40:02.366 --> 01:40:04.664
That's gonna be
a hard one.

01:40:13.311 --> 01:40:15.541
- In poetry, if...
- It has to be midnight 'cause...

01:40:15.713 --> 01:40:18.181
I know. Okay.

01:40:25.523 --> 01:40:26.956
Hi, Mrs. Cavendar.

01:40:27.024 --> 01:40:28.286
Hi, Amber.

01:40:28.359 --> 01:40:29.553
I just wanted to
return the gown.

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:30.684
Thank you.

01:40:30.795 --> 01:40:32.660
Oh, and Bliss left
this at her station.

01:40:32.730 --> 01:40:34.322
I wasn't sure if
she still wanted it.

01:40:34.398 --> 01:40:35.558
Thank you.

01:40:36.400 --> 01:40:37.697
How did you do?

01:40:37.802 --> 01:40:39.394
I came in second.

01:40:39.504 --> 01:40:41.028
Good for you.

01:40:41.138 --> 01:40:42.730
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

01:40:57.755 --> 01:40:59.814
"The person I admire most..

01:41:02.760 --> 01:41:05.820
"..is my mother,
because she is a fighter..

01:41:06.898 --> 01:41:09.730
"..who never gives up
on what she believes in..

01:41:10.700 --> 01:41:12.930
"..and she never
gives up on me.

01:41:14.104 --> 01:41:18.097
"Obviously, I would be delighted
to win the Blue Bonnet pageant.

01:41:19.409 --> 01:41:23.505
"But knowing my mother
is proud of me..

01:41:26.182 --> 01:41:28.412
"..means more than
any crown."

01:42:07.424 --> 01:42:08.652
Earl.

01:42:09.392 --> 01:42:10.586
Ronny.

01:42:55.505 --> 01:42:57.029
Wait.
Turn the music up.

01:43:00.477 --> 01:43:02.172
Roller derby
is not a crime.

01:43:02.278 --> 01:43:05.611
Come on man. Roller
derby is not a crime.

01:43:20.230 --> 01:43:21.527
Undefeated.

01:43:45.555 --> 01:43:46.919
How do I get out?

01:43:47.256 --> 01:43:48.382
There we go.

01:43:49.391 --> 01:43:53.418
Get out. I can't do it
Do it for me.

01:44:04.907 --> 01:44:07.171
Female Fight Club!
Okay, all right.

01:44:15.117 --> 01:44:17.108
I love you.
Oh, I love you.

01:44:32.301 --> 01:44:35.464
Hey, inbreeders, you're
supposed to leave a tip.

01:44:43.912 --> 01:44:46.710
If Jack Black was working
here... is it Jack White?

01:44:47.583 --> 01:44:50.108
- He's sexy.
- I like Jack Black.

01:44:50.652 --> 01:44:53.086
Here you go, baby. You have
as much of that as you want.

01:44:53.155 --> 01:44:54.144
Okay

01:44:57.159 --> 01:44:58.820
It's just so funny.

01:45:01.263 --> 01:45:02.321
Hey.

01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:07.628
Fishnets and sexy nicknames.
