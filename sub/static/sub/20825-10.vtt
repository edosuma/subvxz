00:12.763 --> 00:15.641
[theme music playing]

01:49.860 --> 01:53.571
The dead sleep with their eyes open,
my grandfather would say.

01:53.656 --> 01:56.366
They're watching you from the past...

01:56.449 --> 01:57.993
[Doug] Jackie Sharp.

01:58.076 --> 01:59.620
Romero wasted no time.

01:59.703 --> 02:00.871
What good are you?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.998
You Democrats are full of surprises.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.917
[Doug] Her lawyers won't let us
get anywhere near her.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.044
[Mark] Because they're negotiating
her testimony.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.586
How the hell did we get here?

02:08.670 --> 02:11.965
Romero was privy to information.
Someone from within the party.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.592
[Mark] He's threatening
to go after her for whipping votes

02:14.677 --> 02:17.888
in exchange for campaign funds
from a Mr. Remy Danton,

02:17.971 --> 02:20.015
who, shockingly, she was sleeping with.

02:20.098 --> 02:22.100
Well, she's not testifying
because of an affair.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.144
She's testifying
'cause she doesn't want to go to jail.

02:24.227 --> 02:26.354
Which is the only reason anyone testifies.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.650
Doug, keep at the rest of the Democrats
on that committee.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.359
Make sure they stay in line.

02:31.443 --> 02:34.404
I'll keep working my side of the aisle,
but... uh, Romero.

02:34.487 --> 02:35.613
He's a prick.

02:35.698 --> 02:38.241
[Mark] Mmm-hmm,
prick who still wants whip.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.035
Terry Womack has been very loyal.

02:40.118 --> 02:42.579
Yeah, well, there's loyal,
and then there's good.

02:44.164 --> 02:45.916
What has Womack brought you?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.335
Did he kill
the Declaration of War Committee?

02:48.836 --> 02:50.337
Did he deliver Missouri
for you in November?

02:50.420 --> 02:51.629
That's enough.

02:52.715 --> 02:53.799
Let's give it to him.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.718
Look, sometimes you
have to make hard choices.

02:55.801 --> 02:57.427
I'll talk to Terry.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.513
Romero's gonna have to find
a place for him to land, and...

03:00.597 --> 03:02.515
where that is matters to me.

03:02.599 --> 03:03.934
That'll be all for now.

03:05.352 --> 03:06.353
Yes, sir.

03:16.654 --> 03:17.823
-Put Doyle on this.
-[door closes]

03:19.616 --> 03:20.951
We already vetted Romero.

03:21.034 --> 03:23.078
No, I mean on Usher.

03:25.247 --> 03:27.040
[Green on phone]
<i>The body is remarkably well-preserved,</i>

03:27.124 --> 03:29.752
<i>except for the extremities,</i>
<i>which frostbite took care of.</i>

03:29.835 --> 03:31.211
<i>But dental is intact.</i>

03:31.294 --> 03:34.006
<i>Our counterparts in Antarctica</i>
<i>are cooperating fully,</i>

03:34.089 --> 03:36.549
<i>and the body will be in our possession</i>
<i>within the next 12 hours.</i>

03:36.633 --> 03:38.343
<i>I'll have it in transit after customs.</i>

03:38.426 --> 03:41.346
We'd like the body to get lost in transit.

03:41.429 --> 03:42.680
<i>Ma'am?</i>

03:42.765 --> 03:44.266
It needs to get lost.

03:45.183 --> 03:46.184
<i>Yes.</i>

03:47.685 --> 03:50.147
Okay. Thank you, Assistant Director Green.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.648
Uh, keep in touch.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.866
-I thought you'd gone to bed.
-Can't yet.

04:04.327 --> 04:06.538
-Who's that?
-No one we know.

04:10.125 --> 04:11.835
Tom, I said it's no one we know.

04:17.589 --> 04:22.720
You ever hear about the 5,000-year-old man
they found frozen in the Italian Alps?

04:23.889 --> 04:25.098
No.

04:26.266 --> 04:29.311
His skull was caved in... from the back.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.022
He probably never saw it coming.

04:34.900 --> 04:37.694
Beaten and left for dead.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.867
Left for dead is an ancient concept.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.370
You know, when you freeze to death...

04:48.288 --> 04:51.624
the last thing you feel is extreme heat.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.168
That hurts.

04:54.169 --> 04:55.212
Sorry.

04:59.216 --> 05:00.675
I saw Francis out there.

05:02.052 --> 05:03.595
He seems on edge.

05:05.722 --> 05:06.849
Can you blame him?

05:09.559 --> 05:10.560
Better?

05:14.022 --> 05:15.565
[Frank panting]

05:32.875 --> 05:34.626
Shoplifting is the worst of it.

05:35.543 --> 05:39.339
A couple of recent street buys
that led to court-mandated rehab.

05:39.422 --> 05:44.344
That's where she lives, where she works,
where she scores... [inhales deeply]

05:44.427 --> 05:47.890
But all I see here is a woman in her 20s,
trying to get to 30.

05:48.974 --> 05:51.643
-She's a concern.
-I don't get it.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.646
She was in touch with Gavin Orsay
before he left for Venezuela.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.231
-Doug...
-Nathan!

05:57.149 --> 05:59.734
There's a bite to your tone
that we might need to discuss.

06:02.529 --> 06:04.656
She's a loose end and an addict.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.618
That's a bad combination.

06:13.040 --> 06:14.249
It's a clean slate.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.460
Donald Blythe's taste was
a bit too dark for me,

06:17.544 --> 06:19.004
so I stripped it all back.

06:20.297 --> 06:23.591
I have chosen one painting so far
that's on its way, though.

06:24.467 --> 06:27.512
Thad Peterson's body is taken care of.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.431
His name is John Doe.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.434
I'd recognize him anywhere.

06:34.602 --> 06:37.064
This would've been very embarrassing
to some interests

06:37.147 --> 06:38.565
that are important to this country.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.193
And I wouldn't want the family
to see him this way.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.862
What's the news
from the Jordanian Embassy?

06:46.364 --> 06:51.286
Aidan Macallan still won't reveal
what he did or didn't tell Petrov.

06:51.369 --> 06:53.788
Well, the president wants him
brought back from his asylum

06:53.871 --> 06:55.248
to the United States immediately.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.833
I think we should give it
a little more time.

06:58.460 --> 07:01.546
You know, I wonder if it was
such a good idea to bring you in on this.

07:01.629 --> 07:04.716
-You promised--
-I know. I know. Ahmadi...

07:06.551 --> 07:09.054
We've got Special Forces
on the ground, tracking.

07:09.137 --> 07:12.890
Russia's presence in Syria is making this
more difficult than I once thought.

07:12.975 --> 07:16.353
I need to know what Macallan told Petrov.

07:16.937 --> 07:21.441
It never ceases to astonish me
how talented men are at making a mess.

07:27.822 --> 07:28.823
[door closes]

07:36.289 --> 07:38.500
Uh, it's not gonna serve you
to go after your own party.

07:38.583 --> 07:40.293
[scoffs] You never stop.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.172
Jackie Sharp will never testify.

07:44.256 --> 07:45.798
Well, then she'll go to jail.

07:46.716 --> 07:49.761
You can't prove it, Alex.
You can't prove the quid pro quo.

07:49.844 --> 07:51.013
She seems to think I can.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.599
If you play it a little differently,
you have a chance to get what you want.

07:54.682 --> 07:57.227
-We're offering you whip.
-[scoffs]

07:57.310 --> 07:59.396
-I don't want it anymore.
-What?

08:00.480 --> 08:01.689
Jesus Christ.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.693
Ways and Means, then.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.945
The keynote at the next convention.

08:08.030 --> 08:09.990
What I want is for Francis Underwood
to go to jail.

08:10.073 --> 08:11.241
How is that gonna help you?

08:12.575 --> 08:14.536
Really? How's it gonna help you?

08:19.249 --> 08:20.750
There's another way to go at it.

08:22.710 --> 08:24.754
Wanna make a name for yourself? [sniffs]

08:24.837 --> 08:26.464
You wanna make the president's life
a living hell?

08:26.548 --> 08:28.091
Draw it out.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.677
Keep the committee going
but at a slow burn.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.595
Aren't you working for him?

08:32.679 --> 08:35.390
Members of the administration,
you bring 'em in one at a time.

08:35.472 --> 08:38.809
You could ride this for a couple of years
and secure your place.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.770
While you keep the president in check.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.399
Don't end it before it's begun
by calling Jackie Sharp.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.858
You know I see good things for you.

08:45.942 --> 08:48.361
Let me plan out your next eight years.

08:48.445 --> 08:51.239
Hmm. The candidates you worked with...

08:53.616 --> 08:58.288
how many of them have waited and waited
and lost their moment? Hmm?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.916
Yeah, that's right.

09:01.999 --> 09:04.502
I'm reading the moment, and this is mine.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.505
Let me out on Third Street.
[clears throat]

09:07.589 --> 09:10.425
-I'll drop you at Rayburn.
-No, I always walk the final 50 yards.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.635
Never know when you might
get a chance to press some flesh.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.720
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.098
Hi, I'm Alex Romero.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.975
I represent the Seventh District
of Arizona.

09:19.059 --> 09:22.437
I want to know what keeps you up at night,
so I can work all day to address it.

09:22.520 --> 09:24.397
The future belongs to all of us.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.566
I hope I can count on your support.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.903
What do you think, Mark? Huh?

09:30.987 --> 09:32.780
I mean, you're the expert.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.617
Right here.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.496
[Mark] <i>Romero said no,</i>
<i>and the usual offers don't interest him.</i>

09:39.579 --> 09:41.873
Oh, he's interested.
He just hates himself for it.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.501
I am making headway
with the Republicans on the committee.

09:44.584 --> 09:47.754
They all have pasts,
most of them have witnesses.

09:47.837 --> 09:50.132
<i>One way or another,</i>
<i>Jackie Sharp won't be testifying.</i>

09:50.215 --> 09:53.385
So why are you having so much trouble
with this one young congressman?

09:53.468 --> 09:54.636
He's tenacious.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.805
He reminds me of you.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.558
Well, I don't see that at all.
We'll talk later.

10:02.310 --> 10:03.603
I could reach out to Danton--

10:03.686 --> 10:05.730
We expose him, he'll expose us.

10:05.813 --> 10:09.484
-Well, then what do you suggest?
-That I go on being presidential.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.403
That's the only way
that I can deal with this.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.946
It's my first 100 days, for God's sake.

10:15.072 --> 10:16.073
Francis...

10:17.033 --> 10:19.244
we're going to get our hands on Ahmadi.

10:19.327 --> 10:21.704
There aren't enough Ahmadis in the world.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.415
Not for all we've done.

10:23.498 --> 10:24.582
Then what?

10:25.667 --> 10:29.796
Destroy Romero, for one.
Can we at least take care of that?

10:29.879 --> 10:31.756
And then who?
The rest of the Democratic Party?

10:31.839 --> 10:34.217
I know what I'm doing, Claire.
I've been president before.

10:34.301 --> 10:35.510
So have I.

10:36.553 --> 10:38.263
Get me Terry Womack.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.142
Your job as vice president is to advise.

10:42.225 --> 10:44.852
-My job is to make the decisions.
-[phone beeps]

10:46.229 --> 10:49.899
Terry, yes, I'm just checking in.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.905
Mmm-hmm. Well, I want you
to know that we support you.

10:55.988 --> 10:58.991
That bastard asked for whip,
but that's never gonna happen.

10:59.075 --> 11:01.077
Not while I'm in this office.
I wanted to assure you.

11:01.869 --> 11:03.580
I've always tried to help where I can.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.082
And you couldn't help
at Health and Human Services?

11:07.083 --> 11:09.711
The agency does some amazing work.

11:10.628 --> 11:14.090
Well, you were quoted as, uh,
calling your position a dream job.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.134
It's possible to have more than one dream.

11:18.052 --> 11:20.638
I can have my assistant give you a tour.

11:20.722 --> 11:23.099
Uh, show you some of the video from Haiti

11:23.182 --> 11:25.935
and some of the work
that we've been doing there

11:26.018 --> 11:27.437
over the last several months.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.439
[chuckles] I will be sure to include

11:29.522 --> 11:31.107
your organization
in the piece I'm writing.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.026
-I believe in the work you're doing here.
-Thank you.

11:34.611 --> 11:37.196
What was it like, uh,
working with the Underwood administration?

11:38.573 --> 11:41.075
They were fine. [chuckles]
Let's leave it at that.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.498
You know, I've met with, uh,
many wonderful organizations so far.

11:46.581 --> 11:50.752
-The Virginia Children's Defense Fund.
-They do some great work.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.087
Mmm, uh, The Talbot League?

11:53.170 --> 11:54.422
Another terrific group.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.051
The Anthony Moretti Memorial Fund.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.223
I don't know anything about them.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.852
Organ transplantation awareness.

12:07.935 --> 12:09.854
Oh, is that right?

12:10.980 --> 12:11.981
Hmm.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.027
Hi.

12:17.487 --> 12:19.906
I'm so sorry. [chuckles]

12:19.989 --> 12:22.784
It's rude, but I was famished.

12:22.867 --> 12:25.412
Thank you for meeting me.
Let me get you a menu.

12:25.495 --> 12:28.290
Uh, no, thank you.
I have a lunch right after this.

12:29.123 --> 12:31.584
[softly] Good. You should
always have one on the books.

12:32.669 --> 12:33.878
[sighs]

12:39.133 --> 12:41.511
-Miss Davis?
-You're worried about Aidan.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.597
Do you call him anything for short?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.600
Why would you ask me that?

12:49.226 --> 12:51.438
I don't know if the president,
or vice president,

12:51.521 --> 12:53.272
has informed you, but Mac is fine.

12:53.356 --> 12:57.444
It's what he knows is the problem,
and who he may have told it to.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.530
He wants to stay alive.

13:03.074 --> 13:04.492
Yes.

13:04.576 --> 13:07.036
But those are the ones
you have to watch out for.

13:09.456 --> 13:12.542
Last I spoke to Aidan
was minutes before he got in a cab.

13:13.125 --> 13:15.378
I don't know what he has
or what he's done.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.088
I only do what I'm told.

13:19.215 --> 13:20.925
I'm in the Hoover Building.

13:21.008 --> 13:24.095
It's the ugliest building in...
in the city.

13:24.178 --> 13:25.888
I close my eyes as I walk in.

13:27.306 --> 13:30.518
Stop by any time.
Especially if you're in the mood to talk.

13:30.602 --> 13:33.312
We could use someone
who says as little as you do.

13:46.283 --> 13:48.077
[sirens wailing in distance]

14:00.965 --> 14:03.175
[music playing indistinctly
over headphones]

14:12.101 --> 14:13.561
[dog barking]

14:41.839 --> 14:43.132
Lisa!

14:50.056 --> 14:52.892
-I've been looking for her.
-I have no idea where she is.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.021
-Let me help you with that.
-No. No, I'm okay.

14:58.773 --> 15:01.609
-I'm happy to carry it for you.
-You're scaring me.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.488
I'm just worried about her. That's all.

15:06.614 --> 15:07.740
I'm clean.

15:08.950 --> 15:09.951
Good.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.663
At least I'm trying to get clean.
Please leave me alone.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.164
Hey...

15:18.668 --> 15:19.836
[sighs]

15:22.839 --> 15:23.840
Just...

15:25.341 --> 15:27.552
If you hear from Rachel, just, uh...

15:28.845 --> 15:30.805
tell her I've taken care of everything.

15:32.724 --> 15:34.892
She can come home
and everything will be fine.

15:35.477 --> 15:37.353
[dog barking]

15:41.899 --> 15:43.317
I miss her, you know?

15:50.533 --> 15:51.534
I'm sorry.

15:54.203 --> 15:55.497
[barking]

16:03.212 --> 16:04.922
[barking continues]

16:21.355 --> 16:23.650
[cell phone ringing]

16:23.733 --> 16:24.901
You going to answer that?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.653
[Tom] So, was I right?

16:26.736 --> 16:28.404
Your phone is ringing.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.448
Uh, oh...

16:34.869 --> 16:36.078
[sighs]

16:37.163 --> 16:39.666
You know, you can just hang it up
by pressing the button on the side.

16:39.749 --> 16:42.334
-You don't have to decline--
-I'm a creature of habit.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.839
So, yeah, you were right.

16:46.923 --> 16:50.342
This phone has only been used once
to call one number, once.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.095
I mean, I used
the manufacturer's serial number

16:53.179 --> 16:55.097
and tracked down
where it's distributed to.

16:55.181 --> 16:57.850
It was a, um... a shop in Dupont Circle.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.185
And who did it call?

16:59.811 --> 17:01.395
Comes up unknown.

17:01.478 --> 17:03.105
But the prefix...

17:03.189 --> 17:05.900
And, look, you're gonna have to talk
to the police or the FBI.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.027
-I just can't keep--
-Don't worry. It's on me.

17:08.109 --> 17:11.446
The prefix on the call,
it looks like a government number to me.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.281
[cell phone ringing]

17:15.284 --> 17:16.452
Hello.

17:19.121 --> 17:21.790
He followed you? When?

17:21.874 --> 17:24.001
-[mouthing] I've got to...
-[softly] Yeah.

17:25.877 --> 17:28.380
Okay. Okay, if you feel safe
where you are, stay there.

17:28.464 --> 17:29.674
I'm coming to you.

17:32.051 --> 17:33.094
[Seth] Thanks.

17:35.346 --> 17:37.389
So what couldn't you tell me
over the phone?

17:38.307 --> 17:39.642
Jackie Sharp.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.603
What about her?

17:43.062 --> 17:44.355
You really don't know?

17:46.023 --> 17:48.067
I thought this was coming
out of the White House.

17:48.150 --> 17:49.318
[inhales deeply]

17:49.401 --> 17:53.489
The story's about to break that she
traded legislation for campaign funds.

17:53.573 --> 17:54.616
The source?

17:55.825 --> 17:57.744
So, unconfirmed.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.537
It's going to be on <i>Drudge</i>
within the hour.

18:02.414 --> 18:04.250
You really don't have anything to say?

18:05.417 --> 18:08.170
If it's true, it's just sad
to see the unexpected fall

18:08.254 --> 18:09.797
of a once rising star
in the Democratic Party.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.007
Stop it.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.468
Sharp would've been a get
for the committee.

18:16.846 --> 18:20.141
If you're still willing to appear,
we're still willing to talk.

18:24.561 --> 18:25.730
See ya.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.074
This is not how we do things
in this administration.

18:37.158 --> 18:39.035
You wanted her not to testify.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.037
And there's no way
Romero can force her to now.

18:43.956 --> 18:47.627
You've put my press secretary and
his staff in a very difficult situation.

18:47.710 --> 18:50.379
It was a leak,
and it didn't come from you.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.339
I really felt this was the way
to get ahead of it.

18:52.423 --> 18:53.424
This is getting ahead of it?

18:53.507 --> 18:56.636
I guarantee you her lawyers tell her
to plead the Fifth now, across the board.

18:56.719 --> 18:58.387
Most importantly, where it concerns you.

18:58.470 --> 19:00.973
But all of this happened
while I was negotiating with Petrov.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.850
Oh, to the public,
you were the First Lady,

19:02.934 --> 19:04.727
sitting vigil by your husband's bed.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.479
So, actually, all of this happened
under Donald Blythe's watch.

19:09.190 --> 19:10.650
I'm sorry if you think I overstepped.

19:12.443 --> 19:14.028
I was trying to protect you.

19:22.453 --> 19:23.996
He did the right thing.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.497
Oh, I don't mind what he did.

19:26.332 --> 19:27.834
I mind the way he did it.

19:29.711 --> 19:31.503
-LeAnn...
-Madam Vice President.

19:31.587 --> 19:33.464
I'm sorry my schedule is so full.

19:33.547 --> 19:36.217
No, I completely understand,
with everything that you're dealing with.

19:36.300 --> 19:38.177
I'm sorry for being so insistent,

19:38.260 --> 19:40.847
but I thought you should know
that Jane Davis came after me yesterday.

19:40.930 --> 19:41.973
Came after you?

19:42.056 --> 19:44.684
She wanted me to work for her.
I didn't know if you knew.

19:44.767 --> 19:45.893
In what capacity?

19:46.811 --> 19:49.105
That, I'm not clear on, but it... [sighs]

19:49.188 --> 19:51.899
She wanted information
about Aidan Macallan.

19:51.983 --> 19:54.026
I hope you know I would never say a word.

19:55.361 --> 19:57.321
Thank you for bringing this
to my attention.

19:58.740 --> 20:01.743
Ma'am, I was hoping
we could discuss my future.

20:01.826 --> 20:05.079
Oh, LeAnn, I would love
to discuss your future, but not yet.

20:06.998 --> 20:10.251
If you would like, ma'am,
I can help with Aidan.

20:10.334 --> 20:11.460
Anything that's required.

20:12.211 --> 20:13.504
That's good to know.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.568
Did you think LeAnn Harvey
wouldn't tell me?

20:36.652 --> 20:39.196
I never assume what people
will do or won't do.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.116
-I thought we were working well together.
-We are.

20:42.199 --> 20:47.454
Well, going around me to get information
will only create discord between us.

20:48.039 --> 20:49.832
I wouldn't want that, Claire.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.794
-Miss Davis.
-Mr. President.

20:52.877 --> 20:54.086
I'm sorry I'm late.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.130
The vice president has told me
that your contacts

20:56.213 --> 20:58.758
have once again lost track of Ahmadi.

20:58.841 --> 21:00.259
Yes, as I explained,

21:00.342 --> 21:03.512
Syria is like a different country
one day to the next.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.765
Yes, well, you can thank
Viktor Petrov for that.

21:05.848 --> 21:07.516
Oh, I do.

21:07.599 --> 21:09.018
[knocking on door]

21:10.144 --> 21:11.187
Ma'am?

21:11.270 --> 21:13.230
Oh, you'll have to excuse me, Jane.

21:13.314 --> 21:15.399
The schedule is crazy these days.

21:15.482 --> 21:16.776
Oh, of course.

21:19.028 --> 21:21.197
Really? The State Department,
the Pentagon,

21:21.280 --> 21:22.907
we can't get close to Ahmadi?

21:22.990 --> 21:24.658
I just want peace.

21:24.741 --> 21:27.244
Yes, there's nothing that makes
profits like peace.

21:27.328 --> 21:30.497
And nothing makes peace like profits.

21:31.707 --> 21:34.293
Mr. President, may I be blunt?

21:35.419 --> 21:38.130
Well, I would never accuse you
of dullness, Miss Davis.

21:39.340 --> 21:41.008
[clears throat]

21:41.092 --> 21:45.179
There's going to be a gas attack
happening in the city of Homs.

21:46.889 --> 21:49.766
If you were to, let us say,
draw a line in the sand...

21:50.476 --> 21:53.104
and if this tragic attack
were to happen...

21:54.105 --> 21:59.610
the US government would have to send in
an additional 30,000 or so soldiers.

22:00.194 --> 22:05.157
To protect the oil lines,
to keep Petrov from getting into Damascus.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.660
And, of course, to protect the people.

22:10.830 --> 22:14.834
That's venturing close to occupation
with those kind of numbers.

22:14.917 --> 22:19.088
All I'm saying is
maybe the Declaration of War Committee

22:19.171 --> 22:21.715
could finally debate
what they were mandated to.

22:22.633 --> 22:23.634
A war.

22:30.224 --> 22:32.101
Do you know Mark Usher?

22:35.646 --> 22:38.815
Yes, we worked together.

22:39.483 --> 22:41.652
He was handling a congressman.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.404
Mark.

22:45.239 --> 22:46.657
Has anyone offered you anything?

22:46.740 --> 22:48.284
Oh, no, I'm good. Thanks.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.796
Have you ever worked with Jane Davis?

23:02.798 --> 23:05.051
Davis is the stepfather's name.

23:06.260 --> 23:07.719
A one-term senator.

23:09.305 --> 23:13.600
Uh, anyway, yeah, she was interested
in a client I had, at some point.

23:14.726 --> 23:16.228
A candidate for Congress.

23:16.312 --> 23:20.149
Poor guy. The minute Usher realized
he wasn't formidable enough,

23:20.232 --> 23:22.193
he just dumped him. Let him go.

23:23.277 --> 23:24.278
But that's Mark.

23:25.737 --> 23:27.698
He has an eye for talent.

23:27.781 --> 23:30.867
Likes to keep you close
while he keeps himself remote.

23:31.368 --> 23:34.580
But he disagreed
with some of her positions,

23:34.663 --> 23:35.872
the money went away.

23:36.790 --> 23:40.419
Listen, don't let Jane fool you.

23:41.795 --> 23:45.549
She can seem a bit... haphazard...

23:45.632 --> 23:47.301
[Davis] <i>But once he's done with you...</i>

23:48.760 --> 23:52.181
it's as if a switch gets turned off.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.515
[Mark] <i>But she is merciless.</i>

23:55.892 --> 23:58.020
Single-minded as a single mind can be.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.320
Mmm.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.620
Mmm.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.291
What? Forgot to eat today.

24:20.376 --> 24:21.752
What have you got for me?

24:24.296 --> 24:26.882
-I don't know.
-Don't do "I don't know."

24:29.260 --> 24:30.677
Saw Meredith Lee.

24:32.096 --> 24:36.392
I mentioned the Moretti Fund,
organ transplants, uh...

24:36.475 --> 24:39.020
She got a little tense,
but... I don't know.

24:40.687 --> 24:41.980
Why didn't you tell me you were fired?

24:42.564 --> 24:44.941
-Oh, that was you?
-Who talked to your girlfriend? Yeah.

24:46.068 --> 24:47.153
How long?

24:48.112 --> 24:50.239
What's the difference? I'm tapped.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.536
What are we doing here?
I don't like eating in my car.

24:56.745 --> 24:58.330
[sighs]

24:58.414 --> 25:01.083
I think Laura Moretti's husband
was jumped on the donor list.

25:02.959 --> 25:05.129
-Where the hell did you get that?
-My gut.

25:06.047 --> 25:07.173
I can lay it out for you.

25:07.256 --> 25:09.550
Yeah, you say something like that,
you better.

25:10.384 --> 25:14.513
Sarin gas. Mostly against civilians
in suburban areas of Homs.

25:14.596 --> 25:17.308
-We're dealing with animals here.
-It's horrifying.

25:17.391 --> 25:20.186
Now, you know I've always shown
restraint in the past, but...

25:20.269 --> 25:24.523
I'm going to be making
an executive order for military action.

25:24.606 --> 25:27.651
Air strikes followed by ground troops.

25:27.734 --> 25:29.570
You'll need to present to the UN.

25:30.404 --> 25:34.075
-Where is this intelligence coming from?
-Well, it's all there in the briefing.

25:35.159 --> 25:37.203
But if we know this is going to happen,

25:37.286 --> 25:40.956
well, then why aren't we stopping it
before it does?

25:45.586 --> 25:48.505
Francis held on
to your resignation letter.

25:49.965 --> 25:52.301
And he wants to tear it up.

25:59.683 --> 26:04.146
I know how difficult
these past few months have been for you.

26:04.230 --> 26:06.357
We've really asked a lot.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.567
Once we're on the other side
of this military action,

26:08.650 --> 26:12.363
you have our blessing
to leave the administration if you choose.

26:13.530 --> 26:15.741
[Frank] But, of course,
we'd prefer if you stay on.

26:16.450 --> 26:18.327
Hope that goes without saying.

26:23.624 --> 26:27.669
Using weapons of mass destruction
against civilians is a war crime.

26:27.753 --> 26:31.215
I appreciate the opportunity
to see this through to the end.

26:31.298 --> 26:33.467
We were hoping you would say that.

26:33.550 --> 26:34.718
Thank you, Cathy.

26:34.801 --> 26:36.303
Thank you, Mr. President.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.558
[door opens and closes]

26:41.642 --> 26:43.185
Are you worried about her?

26:44.603 --> 26:48.190
We need to start thinking about the people
we surround ourselves with.

26:49.107 --> 26:51.360
Which has made me think of Tom...

26:52.569 --> 26:57.199
who doesn't really have a reason
to be here anymore, does he?

26:59.410 --> 27:00.744
Not an official one, no,

27:00.827 --> 27:03.872
but I thought maybe we
could bring him on as a consultant.

27:09.378 --> 27:10.712
[Frank sniffs]

27:14.883 --> 27:17.052
Well, of course,
that's entirely up to you.

27:18.179 --> 27:21.139
There's just only so much time
and energy in a single day,

27:21.223 --> 27:23.725
and I think we need
to constantly be asking ourselves,

27:23.809 --> 27:26.895
"Am I spending it as wisely as I can?"

27:39.866 --> 27:41.785
-Thank you.
-Jane, I'm so sorry

27:41.868 --> 27:43.370
-to pull you away from your party.
-No, no, no.

27:43.454 --> 27:45.956
-When I heard your voice on the phone--
-I just... I just...

27:46.039 --> 27:49.042
-I don't know what to do.
-Did something happen?

27:49.125 --> 27:53.046
The Underwoods are planning air strikes
and a troop surge in Homs.

27:55.299 --> 27:58.260
-How awful.
-Do you know anything about this?

28:00.221 --> 28:04.140
[sighs] Petrov is making
the whole region a disaster.

28:04.225 --> 28:07.478
No one who ever got tangled up
in the Middle East came out ahead.

28:07.561 --> 28:09.896
Let Petrov own it.

28:14.860 --> 28:17.946
There's something terrible
that is going to happen...

28:18.029 --> 28:19.448
that we can prevent.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.616
I see.

28:21.157 --> 28:24.119
I'm scheduled to present
some kind of red line at the UN.

28:24.202 --> 28:26.747
-But we can still pull back.
-How can I help?

28:27.623 --> 28:30.751
Talk to the president,
the vice president.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.087
I will.

28:36.757 --> 28:39.468
They're terrible, terrible people,
aren't they?

28:43.805 --> 28:44.806
Jane...

28:46.517 --> 28:48.394
be very careful with them.

28:50.687 --> 28:51.688
Of course.

28:54.275 --> 28:56.026
That's from an old friend.

28:58.820 --> 29:00.113
Are we still friends?

29:01.740 --> 29:02.908
Of course.

29:17.964 --> 29:18.965
[vehicle door closes]

29:24.179 --> 29:26.014
He says the liver the president received

29:26.097 --> 29:29.518
was supposed to go to a man
named Anthony Moretti.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.227
And he says that Doug forced

29:31.312 --> 29:33.439
then Secretary
of Health and Human Services

29:33.522 --> 29:35.190
to put the president
at the top of the list,

29:35.274 --> 29:36.984
which resulted in Moretti's death.

29:38.277 --> 29:42.531
Oh, and Doug also has become involved
with the man's widow.

29:43.114 --> 29:44.199
That's a nice touch.

29:45.241 --> 29:47.494
And does... does he have proof?

29:47.578 --> 29:50.331
About the relationship?
It's easy to prove that.

29:51.164 --> 29:53.292
But the list, he knows that
Meredith Lee is hiding something.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.919
And he's ready to go back
and talk to her about it.

29:56.837 --> 29:57.963
Do you trust him?

29:59.381 --> 30:01.216
I don't know why he'd make any of this up.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.344
Hey, I'm outside.

30:09.099 --> 30:10.684
Did you have a good time?

30:13.228 --> 30:15.439
I never do at those things anymore.

30:16.022 --> 30:17.608
Necessary evils.

30:17.691 --> 30:21.236
It's not like the old days,
when you used to meet surprising people.

30:21.320 --> 30:22.571
[chuckles]

30:22.654 --> 30:26.241
Uh... did people get less surprising
or are we less easily surprised?

30:28.243 --> 30:29.828
Well, exactly.

30:30.579 --> 30:32.539
-This is me.
-She asked me about you.

30:34.833 --> 30:37.336
-I figured. What'd you say?
-That you're...

30:39.755 --> 30:42.674
formidable, etcetera.

30:43.759 --> 30:48.430
Yeah, I told him the same about you,
etcetera.

30:50.641 --> 30:52.183
He could be a great president.

30:54.978 --> 30:56.312
But does he want to be?

30:56.397 --> 30:58.649
And what is great?

31:01.067 --> 31:02.611
And then there's her.

31:03.695 --> 31:04.738
What about her?

31:06.532 --> 31:07.574
What about her?

31:13.539 --> 31:15.832
[car engine starts]

31:15.916 --> 31:18.209
Because if Bob or Terry
were the ranking member,

31:18.293 --> 31:19.545
I'd be talking to them.

31:20.462 --> 31:23.214
I want Romero's clerk stripped.

31:23.799 --> 31:26.468
Yeah, whatever budget he's got
for his seat on that committee.

31:26.552 --> 31:30.722
No, no, I'm asking
for the sake of the party.

31:30.806 --> 31:33.475
Look, we survived Jackie Sharp,
but it's not gonna end there.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.562
The truth is I'm being punished

31:36.645 --> 31:39.856
for fighting for the issues
that our base cares most about.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.860
Yes, and thank you.

31:44.736 --> 31:46.237
[slams receiver]

31:46.321 --> 31:48.740
Doyle says there's almost nothing
on Usher.

31:49.240 --> 31:51.993
He likes to gamble, usually wins.

31:52.077 --> 31:54.830
But here's the thing...
Doyle spoke with Marshall,

31:54.913 --> 31:58.291
who we know did not have a happy exit
from the Conway campaign.

31:58.374 --> 32:01.503
Now, he said that before Usher
joined our administration,

32:01.587 --> 32:04.339
he was grooming Romero
for a presidential run.

32:06.467 --> 32:10.386
Sir, I believe he's playing both sides
of whatever this committee is after.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.725
[Mark chuckles]
I'm not a Democrat, Jeffrey.

32:14.808 --> 32:18.019
I'm still a Republican,
just happen to work for the White House.

32:18.103 --> 32:21.106
All I'm saying is
let's rein Alex in while we still can.

32:21.982 --> 32:23.525
'Cause after he rips through
his own party,

32:23.608 --> 32:25.068
he'll come after ours,
wouldn't you think?

32:25.819 --> 32:28.697
Yeah, and Jeff, you're the chair...
No... What? No, listen.

32:28.780 --> 32:30.824
Wait. Wait! Wait.

32:32.408 --> 32:34.536
And you owe me, and we both know it,

32:34.620 --> 32:36.872
and that's not the kind of thing
I like to say out loud.

32:36.955 --> 32:37.956
What is?

32:40.125 --> 32:41.502
When did that happen?

32:44.588 --> 32:45.797
Confirmed?

32:52.513 --> 32:53.597
Yeah?

32:54.556 --> 32:55.766
Yes, well...

32:57.643 --> 32:59.144
just because Walker's
gonna take the stand,

32:59.227 --> 33:01.312
doesn't mean he'll say anything.
Right?

33:02.814 --> 33:03.982
Hmm.

33:14.159 --> 33:16.452
What was that word
you said to me this morning?

33:17.370 --> 33:19.164
The one no one uses anymore?

33:20.081 --> 33:21.082
Crepuscular.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.251
Right.

33:27.589 --> 33:31.176
Some of my favorite animals
are crepuscular.

33:31.259 --> 33:32.761
[phone rings]

33:33.595 --> 33:34.805
[Frank] Yes.

33:35.722 --> 33:36.723
What?

33:37.808 --> 33:38.809
When?

33:39.726 --> 33:41.895
Jesus! God damn it!

33:49.736 --> 33:50.946
Claire!

33:52.072 --> 33:54.199
-Claire!
-I'm in the kitchen.

33:55.701 --> 33:57.619
[Frank] Walker's gonna testify.

33:57.703 --> 33:59.705
-[Claire] When?
-Early as next week.

34:00.706 --> 34:02.749
[Claire] He's gonna say the same thing
he said to Hammerschmidt.

34:02.832 --> 34:04.084
There's not gonna be any new damage.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.127
-We don't know that for sure.
-[Claire] Let's get Usher.

34:06.211 --> 34:08.170
[Frank] You bet I'm gonna talk
to him in the morning.

34:08.254 --> 34:09.297
[Claire] Where are you going?

34:09.380 --> 34:12.132
To get some goddamn space in this house!

34:28.650 --> 34:31.737
I can take care of Walker.
We'll make him an offer.

34:32.654 --> 34:34.072
A place back on the stage,

34:34.155 --> 34:36.074
chancellor of some
well-endowed university. He'll take it.

34:36.157 --> 34:39.369
He just might. But first,
I want to know what you have on Romero.

34:39.995 --> 34:41.286
-I don't have a thing.
-[scoffs]

34:41.371 --> 34:43.956
-Please.
-Doug, let's not be rude.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.876
I find that impossible to believe.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.127
If I did, you would know it.

34:47.210 --> 34:48.879
You and I have been at this a long time.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.757
You wouldn't even consider
a candidate without vetting him first.

34:51.840 --> 34:53.007
I thought Alex had a future.

34:53.091 --> 34:55.010
Yeah, a run for the presidency
as I understand it.

34:55.092 --> 34:57.428
He's clean and crisp
as a starched white shirt.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.805
You're gonna have to make
a decision, Mark.

34:58.889 --> 35:00.807
You wanna work for me and Claire, or not?

35:00.891 --> 35:04.310
I have already reached out
to members of my own party.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.897
I've used my political capital
to help you.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.356
But you're still not answering
my question.

35:08.439 --> 35:09.775
I think I have.

35:10.817 --> 35:13.528
And I don't need to convince you
or Mrs. Underwood of my worth.

35:23.747 --> 35:25.206
It's an honor to meet you.

35:26.416 --> 35:29.585
Seth, Mr. Jeffries will catch up
with you momentarily.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.883
I'm going to keep this brief.

35:38.469 --> 35:40.596
If what you're saying is true...

35:40.681 --> 35:44.017
Doug Stamper saved my husband's life.

35:44.100 --> 35:45.185
He did.

35:45.852 --> 35:48.146
And he also cost someone else his.

35:49.981 --> 35:54.820
Well, I suspect you're the kind of man
that wants many things.

35:55.737 --> 35:57.197
But you have made a mistake.

35:58.990 --> 36:02.661
There's only one thing, professionally,
that I've always wanted.

36:03.912 --> 36:06.790
-It's to work in the White House.
-Hmm.

36:06.873 --> 36:08.291
Seth will see you out.

36:12.879 --> 36:14.505
Sorry for the interruption.

36:17.342 --> 36:18.468
You were saying...

36:19.886 --> 36:21.137
[stammers]

36:21.221 --> 36:24.099
Cathy was always a very good person.

36:24.933 --> 36:27.060
At her core, she has a core.

36:27.143 --> 36:28.228
Bless her.

36:28.812 --> 36:33.191
This whole Homs initiative might be
too difficult for her.

36:36.486 --> 36:40.490
You know... you're very hard to read.

36:41.908 --> 36:43.243
Which makes sense.

36:44.660 --> 36:47.789
For the last several years,
you've been a familiar face.

36:49.582 --> 36:51.626
Must get exhausting.

36:51.710 --> 36:55.088
Must be hardly any people
you can even share a laugh with.

37:02.303 --> 37:05.431
You should figure out
how to take full advantage of me.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.894
I can help you get what you want.

37:10.771 --> 37:12.272
If you tell me what it is.

37:12.355 --> 37:14.190
I enjoy helping others.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.943
I think you know what I want.

37:17.027 --> 37:18.194
Yes...

37:19.279 --> 37:21.740
But do you want it now or in four years?

37:27.871 --> 37:32.708
I want the whole world
to see Ahmadi's capture...

37:32.793 --> 37:35.921
on every news outlet and every screen.

37:37.172 --> 37:39.715
For the good of the party,
I'd prefer Mr. Walker not testify.

37:40.300 --> 37:43.178
I'm considering taking myself
off the Declaration of War Committee.

37:43.261 --> 37:46.431
-Alex, you don't have to do that.
-And you can do what you will with it.

37:47.265 --> 37:50.310
But that's conditional
on the president doing the right thing.

37:51.061 --> 37:53.814
Uh-huh. And what is that?

37:53.897 --> 37:55.065
Resigning.

37:55.148 --> 37:57.358
Again, I'm only thinking of the party.

37:57.442 --> 38:00.987
[Mark scoffs and chuckles]

38:01.070 --> 38:04.240
[sighs] Yeah...

38:06.576 --> 38:09.079
Who the fuck do you think you are?

38:09.162 --> 38:11.915
-Oh, don't use that language with me--
-Shut the fuck up.

38:13.041 --> 38:15.460
You have no idea, none,
about what you're doing.

38:15.543 --> 38:18.046
-I'd like you to leave my office.
-Now you listen carefully to me.

38:18.129 --> 38:19.464
-I said--
-Shut up, Alex!

38:21.466 --> 38:22.633
Here's a headline for you.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.136
"Alex Romero colluded with Governor Conway

38:25.220 --> 38:28.473
to use the Declaration of War Committee
to help him win an election."

38:28.556 --> 38:31.434
-No.
-Please, you know you did.

38:32.768 --> 38:34.687
-See how easy that is?
-Get out!

38:36.772 --> 38:40.193
You're gonna be all alone at your hearing.
I just left Walker.

38:40.276 --> 38:42.445
He's gonna plead the Fifth.
You'll look like a fool.

38:44.072 --> 38:47.117
You want to be out front?
No one has a problem with that.

38:48.034 --> 38:51.496
They want you there,
because you'll be the first to fall.

38:55.000 --> 38:56.501
"For the good of the party."

38:58.503 --> 38:59.504
[scoffs]

39:03.258 --> 39:04.843
Sleep tight, Congressman.

39:04.926 --> 39:08.138
-Who knows about Will?
-No one, not yet.

39:08.221 --> 39:09.389
What else?

39:11.474 --> 39:13.684
Why I'm still protecting you
at this point...

39:14.310 --> 39:16.104
I don't even understand myself.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.191
[door bangs]

39:21.192 --> 39:23.028
[Mark] <i>Walker's gonna plead the Fifth.</i>

39:23.111 --> 39:24.779
<i>And Romero won't rock the boat.</i>

39:24.863 --> 39:26.697
Thank you, Mark, I appreciate that.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.075
<i>I would suggest</i>
<i>you schedule a press conference</i>

39:29.159 --> 39:30.618
<i>for right after the hearing.</i>

39:30.701 --> 39:31.702
All right.

39:46.968 --> 39:49.137
Tell me the worst thing you've ever done.

39:52.182 --> 39:53.474
It's hard to pick.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.644
-I'm serious.
-So am I.

40:00.941 --> 40:02.150
[sighs]

40:03.068 --> 40:05.904
Pretended to love someone when I didn't.

40:08.114 --> 40:09.740
In a way, that was the worst.

40:16.998 --> 40:18.499
Did the person know?

40:20.168 --> 40:21.252
Mmm-hmm.

40:22.628 --> 40:24.422
She pretended not to know...

40:26.091 --> 40:27.425
but she knew.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.220
It was awful for her.

40:33.181 --> 40:35.266
But I paid for that mistake, too.

40:37.768 --> 40:39.770
Those types of things, they take a toll.

40:41.147 --> 40:46.611
It's strange how some choices mean nothing
and others govern the rest of your life.

40:49.530 --> 40:51.407
I've done some terrible things.

40:54.619 --> 40:56.037
You don't have to tell me.

40:58.831 --> 41:00.666
Francis killed Zoe Barnes.

41:02.127 --> 41:03.128
[whispers] Claire.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.629
Francis killed Peter.

41:04.712 --> 41:05.838
Stop.

41:05.921 --> 41:07.590
And so many more are gonna die.

41:07.673 --> 41:08.716
Stop.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.150
You don't scare me.

41:26.692 --> 41:27.902
I should.

41:33.241 --> 41:34.617
[car lock beeps]

41:42.417 --> 41:44.002
[gasps and whispers] Aidan.

41:44.085 --> 41:46.004
Shh! Not anymore.

41:46.087 --> 41:47.422
How did you get here?

41:47.505 --> 41:50.008
A door opened, I walked out.

41:50.091 --> 41:51.426
That doesn't sound right.

41:51.509 --> 41:54.345
I got a visa and a flight tonight.
I just...

41:55.846 --> 41:57.348
I just wanted to see you one last time.

41:57.432 --> 41:59.267
Wait. Who's getting you out?

41:59.350 --> 42:00.768
That doesn't matter.

42:01.894 --> 42:04.939
-What did you say?
-Honestly, nothing.

42:05.523 --> 42:06.899
We have to talk to the Underwoods.

42:06.982 --> 42:09.444
-Nah, I don't think so.
-This does not make sense.

42:13.948 --> 42:16.159
Well, you always liked
to drive a nice car.

42:19.079 --> 42:21.997
Aidan, come with me.
I'll fix this.

42:22.082 --> 42:25.000
You come with me.
I've a way for you to get out.

42:27.878 --> 42:29.089
[sighs]

42:32.133 --> 42:33.676
Well, all right, then.

42:43.644 --> 42:45.855
Now, don't you tell anybody you saw me
until the morning.

42:45.938 --> 42:48.191
Why would I tell anyone I saw you at all?

42:48.274 --> 42:49.275
Really?

42:52.445 --> 42:53.446
Wait.

43:01.079 --> 43:03.164
-Here, take this.
-No.

43:03.248 --> 43:06.000
Come on. At least until
you get on the flight, all right?

43:10.755 --> 43:11.922
I'm out.

43:20.598 --> 43:21.766
[car lock chirps]

43:23.976 --> 43:26.104
-[car door closes]
-[engine starting]

43:44.497 --> 43:45.831
Can't sleep?

43:48.293 --> 43:50.920
It's freezing out here.
You should have a coat on.

43:51.003 --> 43:52.087
I like it.

43:56.301 --> 43:57.718
Don't meet with Walker.

43:58.303 --> 43:59.845
I think it's a bad idea.

44:02.056 --> 44:04.809
It'll remind him
of his best course of action.

44:06.561 --> 44:09.522
You're wrong.
I'm sorry, but you're wrong.

44:10.690 --> 44:12.858
Usher has it under control.

44:21.826 --> 44:23.744
You always do what you want.

44:27.332 --> 44:28.749
Tom doesn't want to leave.

44:30.501 --> 44:32.295
[Frank] Tom doesn't get to choose.

44:33.504 --> 44:35.089
It's cold. You should go in.

44:44.139 --> 44:47.977
If you could get me Doug Stamper's
addresses for the last three years...

44:48.811 --> 44:49.812
Uh...

44:55.443 --> 44:58.738
And do you know what happened
to the photo strip of Rachel and Lisa?

44:59.530 --> 45:00.656
It's gone.

45:01.907 --> 45:04.535
[Claire] <i>We need to lay out</i>
<i>our positions ourselves.</i>

45:04.619 --> 45:07.037
I'm already on my way to New York.

45:07.121 --> 45:10.165
<i>I don't want you to say or do anything</i>
<i>that makes you feel uncomfortable.</i>

45:10.250 --> 45:13.127
I won't contradict the administration.
That's not my wish.

45:13.210 --> 45:15.212
We need to draw a line in the sand.

45:15.296 --> 45:19.174
<i>Yes, of course.</i>
<i>Should I get on my flight?</i>

45:19.259 --> 45:22.720
I think it might be best
if you turn around and come back.

45:22.803 --> 45:24.179
<i>Whatever you think.</i>

45:25.097 --> 45:26.849
We'll let Walker plead the Fifth.

45:26.932 --> 45:30.060
Then we'll regroup and make sure
we're on the same page.

45:31.979 --> 45:34.565
Okay. We need to head back.

45:45.493 --> 45:48.829
"Beware entangling alliances,"
Mr. President.

45:49.830 --> 45:51.957
You know, that quote is often
attributed to Washington,

45:52.041 --> 45:54.084
but it was actually Jefferson who said it.

45:56.128 --> 46:00.300
Anyway, I wanted to catch you before,
uh, Mark and your lawyer got here.

46:00.383 --> 46:01.592
Mr. President.

46:02.593 --> 46:04.845
I know this hasn't been easy for you.

46:06.221 --> 46:08.849
Well, the truth is,
one can get used to almost anything.

46:10.685 --> 46:13.103
Well, at any rate, congratulations.

46:13.187 --> 46:14.188
Oh?

46:14.272 --> 46:17.441
You're about to become the chancellor
of one of our finest universities.

46:17.525 --> 46:19.694
It's a high price we pay
for respectability.

46:21.278 --> 46:23.280
Anyway, I just wanted to say hello.

46:24.073 --> 46:26.409
And to thank you for all you're doing.

46:27.327 --> 46:30.871
In not too long, you're going to become
one of those ex-presidents

46:30.955 --> 46:36.210
whose work will make everyone...
forget the past.

46:37.628 --> 46:40.673
I was once the President
of the United States.

46:40.756 --> 46:42.299
Yes, you were.

46:42.383 --> 46:45.553
You stole the presidency, Frank.

46:45.636 --> 46:48.055
[sighs] Now, Garrett...

46:48.138 --> 46:51.642
This is ancient history,
but by modern political standards,

46:51.726 --> 46:53.603
my election was a landslide.

46:54.687 --> 46:56.397
I was gonna change this country.

46:57.314 --> 47:00.693
But then... uh, things happen.

47:00.776 --> 47:02.194
People lie...

47:03.320 --> 47:04.655
You lie to keep up.

47:05.656 --> 47:09.034
The things that you've been
lauded for all your life,

47:09.118 --> 47:12.037
those are suddenly fatal flaws.

47:12.955 --> 47:15.791
People who've been with you
through thick and thin,

47:15.875 --> 47:19.420
who you thought would never fail you,
they fail you.

47:20.796 --> 47:24.008
You make strange alliances
with unsavory people.

47:25.593 --> 47:28.053
And it all becomes clear way too late.

47:31.098 --> 47:32.975
And no one else truly understands.

47:34.602 --> 47:36.729
Except someone who's been in the office...

47:39.273 --> 47:43.193
You can't expect the office to do
anything more than what you bring to it.

47:43.277 --> 47:44.361
Hmm.

47:45.780 --> 47:48.824
-I'm doing this for the party.
-I know.

47:48.908 --> 47:50.325
And it's admirable.

47:58.125 --> 47:59.126
How's Tricia?

48:00.545 --> 48:03.005
Well, it's taken time, but we are good.

48:03.088 --> 48:04.590
The kids are doing well.

48:05.758 --> 48:07.342
Well, this is just the beginning.

48:07.968 --> 48:10.930
You and I are gonna be working
a lot more together from now on.

48:11.013 --> 48:12.097
Is that so?

48:29.490 --> 48:30.700
[Tom] Doug.

48:33.202 --> 48:36.038
Tom, it's a busy morning.
I don't have any quotes right now.

48:36.121 --> 48:37.665
When you have a moment,

48:37.748 --> 48:40.709
I'd like to sit down and ask you
some questions about Lisa Williams.

48:42.503 --> 48:43.838
I'm sorry. What are you talking about?

48:45.172 --> 48:46.674
Let me know when you're free, Doug.

48:47.174 --> 48:48.425
If you'd like a statement,

48:48.509 --> 48:51.679
Seth Grayson's office will be
issuing a press release shortly.

48:51.762 --> 48:54.264
You live near Dupont Circle, don't you?

48:56.809 --> 48:59.144
I will go on the record and say yes, I do.

49:22.459 --> 49:24.253
[Romero] <i>President Walker,</i>

49:24.336 --> 49:27.757
<i>it's been established in Heather Dunbar's</i>
<i>special prosecutor's report</i>

49:27.840 --> 49:28.966
<i>that we have reason to--</i>

49:29.049 --> 49:31.886
<i>Congressman, as I mentioned to the chair</i>

49:31.969 --> 49:34.221
<i>and the other distinguished members</i>
<i>of the committee,</i>

49:34.304 --> 49:37.933
I am advising my client
to plead the Fifth at this time

49:38.017 --> 49:39.769
for all questions regarding his tenure

49:39.852 --> 49:42.271
as President
of the United States of America.

49:42.354 --> 49:44.064
[camera shutters clicking]

49:45.357 --> 49:49.987
I must say, uh, that as a fellow Democrat,
this is highly irregular.

49:50.070 --> 49:53.949
[chuckles] Yes, Congressman, yes.

49:54.033 --> 49:55.450
But in light of ongoing investigations--

49:55.535 --> 49:58.078
Actually, I will answer
the congressman's questions.

49:58.162 --> 49:59.914
[people murmuring]

50:01.707 --> 50:03.167
[speaking indistinctly]

50:03.250 --> 50:05.335
Please, ask your question.

50:08.422 --> 50:09.715
[Romero] <i>Under your administration,</i>

50:09.799 --> 50:11.300
<i>millions of dollars were</i>
<i>illegally laundered</i>

50:11.383 --> 50:14.261
<i>from Chinese businessmen</i>
<i>to affect American elections.</i>

50:14.929 --> 50:16.055
<i>Is this true?</i>

50:17.139 --> 50:18.558
<i>Yes. That's true.</i>

50:18.641 --> 50:20.225
[people murmuring]

50:20.309 --> 50:21.936
[Romero] <i>And can you tell us what, if any,</i>

50:22.019 --> 50:23.938
<i>was then Vice President</i>
<i>Francis Underwood's</i>

50:24.021 --> 50:25.522
<i>involvement in this scheme?</i>

50:26.982 --> 50:30.027
<i>Well, it appeared to me,</i>
<i>he was one of its chief architects.</i>

50:30.110 --> 50:31.486
[murmuring]

50:34.156 --> 50:37.159
And, uh, what exactly
do you mean by that, sir?

50:38.285 --> 50:39.411
It was his idea.

50:39.494 --> 50:41.330
[people murmuring on TV]

50:42.414 --> 50:44.667
Mark, I think you
need to be elsewhere right now.

50:44.750 --> 50:46.794
Are we gonna bury our heads
in the sand with this?

50:48.545 --> 50:50.089
No, you're going to leave,

50:50.172 --> 50:53.092
and the vice president and I
are going to decide what to do.

50:53.175 --> 50:54.802
Walker reneged. We had a deal.

50:54.885 --> 50:56.637
We will let you know if you are needed.

50:56.721 --> 50:58.764
-Sir--
-That was not a request.

51:03.894 --> 51:06.021
Why did you have to go talk to him?

51:08.608 --> 51:10.735
There has to be a way out, Francis.

51:13.237 --> 51:15.615
Does there? Is there?

51:16.991 --> 51:18.826
Or is this my presidency?

51:19.827 --> 51:21.954
Forever with a target on my back.

51:22.955 --> 51:24.624
Haunted and hunted.

51:25.374 --> 51:26.626
[laptop chimes]

51:37.803 --> 51:40.848
[Aidan] <i>LeAnn, if you're hearing this,</i>
<i>it means that I'm dead.</i>

51:54.862 --> 51:56.363
[LeAnn crying]
