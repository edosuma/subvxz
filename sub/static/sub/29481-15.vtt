WEBVTT

00:05.602 --> 00:07.979
No more true crime.
Too depressing.

00:08.311 --> 00:09.689
You don't have
the attention span

00:09.773 --> 00:11.691
for an audiobook
while you're driving.

00:12.367 --> 00:13.585
What about a comedy?

00:13.777 --> 00:15.524
Dude,
I'm not sitting here

00:15.609 --> 00:17.180
through eight hours
of bad jokes.

00:18.694 --> 00:19.915
I don't know
what's happening.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.570
- Oh, now we're breaking down?
- Accelerator's not working.

00:31.742 --> 00:33.142
Do you even know
what you're looking for?

00:33.227 --> 00:34.321
I can call back
to the depot.

00:34.405 --> 00:35.648
Relax.
I got it.

00:36.923 --> 00:39.351
Hey, you guys having
some engine trouble?

00:39.577 --> 00:41.976
Uh, we're good.
Thanks.

00:42.727 --> 00:45.646
I'd be happy
to take a look for you.

00:49.646 --> 00:50.945
Or not.

00:51.632 --> 00:53.510
We're not trying to get
in your way or anything.

00:53.594 --> 00:55.034
I just, I-I know a lot
about engines.

00:55.151 --> 00:56.789
I thought I could help.

00:59.007 --> 01:01.203
You ever work
on a truck this size?

01:01.741 --> 01:03.201
Yeah, a little.

01:03.898 --> 01:05.438
We're not really sure
what happened.

01:05.524 --> 01:06.820
It just kind of shut...

01:06.905 --> 01:08.922
Wait!

01:35.200 --> 01:36.697
<font color=#FF00FF>*FBI*</font>

01:36.782 --> 01:38.470
<font color=#FF00FF>*FBI*</font>
Episode Title: <font color=#FFc30f>"Legacy"</font>

01:39.904 --> 01:42.064
Victims are Luke Hodge
and David Mills,

01:42.166 --> 01:43.275
both long-haul truckers

01:43.366 --> 01:45.150
from a company
based up the road.

01:45.267 --> 01:47.010
Looks like someone came
for the truck,

01:47.114 --> 01:48.787
took the drivers out
in the process.

01:48.872 --> 01:50.166
What was in the truck?

01:50.533 --> 01:51.939
Guns, ammo.

01:52.054 --> 01:53.973
It came from a company
called Riddiford Arms.

01:54.220 --> 01:56.197
Uh, any idea what time
the attack occurred?

01:56.282 --> 01:59.798
Yeah, the truck's internal
GPS was disabled at 5:32 a.m.

01:59.883 --> 02:02.033
We think that's when
the hijackers took over.

02:03.773 --> 02:05.024
There's no skid marks.

02:05.163 --> 02:06.748
They weren't forced
off the road.

02:06.848 --> 02:08.752
There must've been a reason
they pulled over.

02:12.939 --> 02:14.397
Any idea what this is?

02:14.814 --> 02:16.316
No.

02:18.611 --> 02:20.820
The lab will know.

02:25.742 --> 02:27.869
That device in the photo
Maggie and OA sent...

02:27.952 --> 02:29.642
It's a fuel pump kill switch.

02:29.727 --> 02:30.845
Installed in an engine,

02:30.930 --> 02:32.401
it can be used
to remotely disable

02:32.486 --> 02:34.000
a truck's fuel supply on cue,

02:34.205 --> 02:36.294
causing it to break down
as if it ran out of gas.

02:36.377 --> 02:37.962
That explains how
they stopped the truck.

02:38.046 --> 02:39.422
ERT find any prints on it?

02:39.506 --> 02:41.179
No, the perps were likely
wearing gloves.

02:41.264 --> 02:42.563
All right, well,
they were sloppy enough

02:42.648 --> 02:43.922
to leave that thing
at the scene, though.

02:44.007 --> 02:45.459
Doesn't feel like
a professional hit.

02:45.544 --> 02:46.955
Do we know
what was taken yet?

02:47.040 --> 02:49.540
No, ATF is still waiting
on an exact inventory list

02:49.625 --> 02:51.284
from Riddiford,
but it's not looking good.

02:51.369 --> 02:53.386
Military-grade ammo,
assault rifles...

02:53.478 --> 02:55.378
Yeah, not the kind of stuff
we want hitting the streets.

02:55.462 --> 02:56.862
Well, if the person
we're looking for

02:56.946 --> 02:58.479
had access
to the truck's engine,

02:58.564 --> 03:00.151
it was likely an inside job,
right?

03:00.235 --> 03:02.244
Yeah, have Maggie and OA
check in with the arms company.

03:02.328 --> 03:03.328
Yep.

03:05.538 --> 03:07.486
We're really sorry
about your drivers.

03:07.635 --> 03:11.496
Thank you.
We're all still in shock here.

03:11.830 --> 03:14.806
I mean, Luke... I hired him
right out of high school.

03:15.250 --> 03:18.166
He worked here in the warehouse
with me for years.

03:19.336 --> 03:22.840
Just switched to driving
when his daughter was born.

03:23.601 --> 03:25.002
More money.

03:25.735 --> 03:28.439
Have you ever had any issues
with transports in the past?

03:28.524 --> 03:29.858
No.

03:30.046 --> 03:33.080
Our drivers are armed,
ride with companions.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.728
Mrs. Preston,
we are gonna find

03:35.812 --> 03:37.642
the people who did this.

03:38.391 --> 03:40.760
Okay, um, where was
this shipment headed?

03:40.984 --> 03:42.901
To mass retailers
down the coast...

03:42.986 --> 03:44.924
Uh, arms stores, gun shows.

03:45.057 --> 03:47.401
How many people had access to
the truck before it went out?

03:47.486 --> 03:48.533
Not many.

03:48.618 --> 03:49.866
Our trucks are usually secured

03:49.951 --> 03:51.299
here at headquarters.

03:51.446 --> 03:52.799
Only time they're out
of our sight

03:52.884 --> 03:54.873
is right before a long haul,

03:54.956 --> 03:57.432
when they go
for the mechanic's inspection.

03:57.517 --> 03:58.721
Who's your mechanic?

03:58.806 --> 04:01.478
We use a third-party
contractor, off-site.

04:02.892 --> 04:04.846
Okay, uh, we're gonna
need their information.

04:04.939 --> 04:06.049
<i>All right, check it out.</i>

04:06.134 --> 04:08.354
The mechanic that worked
on the truck was Kevin McGuire,

04:08.439 --> 04:09.557
39 years old.

04:09.642 --> 04:10.930
Never showed up
at work today.

04:11.014 --> 04:12.839
Agents aren't getting
an answer at his house.

04:12.924 --> 04:14.371
It's looking more and more
like he was the one

04:14.455 --> 04:15.800
- that sabotaged the fuel line.
- Hey.

04:15.884 --> 04:17.769
- Yeah.
- Wait till you hear this.

04:17.853 --> 04:19.772
Riddiford did not do
such a great job

04:19.856 --> 04:21.899
of screening
their third-party contractors.

04:21.983 --> 04:23.033
McGuire has a record.

04:23.118 --> 04:24.870
Did time for armed robbery
and assault,

04:24.955 --> 04:26.237
fell in with
a white prison gang

04:26.321 --> 04:29.322
while he was on the inside,
the Rikers Royals.

04:29.603 --> 04:30.971
I know the Royals.

04:31.159 --> 04:32.827
Investigated them
with Narcotics,

04:32.911 --> 04:33.885
they're drug traffickers.

04:33.974 --> 04:36.033
And arms traffickers,
and burglars.

04:36.210 --> 04:38.379
Royals used to operate
out of a pool hall in midtown.

04:38.541 --> 04:39.728
Oh, they still do.

04:39.813 --> 04:43.025
It's all over McGuire's
social media, the Rowdy Barrel.

04:43.147 --> 04:44.385
Okay.

04:45.588 --> 04:47.252
All right, good.
Check it out.

04:47.337 --> 04:49.215
See if you can get someone
in McGuire's orbit talking.

04:49.299 --> 04:50.676
Yeah?

05:03.524 --> 05:04.728
Hey.

05:05.189 --> 05:07.853
Isn't that the woman
from McGuire's social media?

05:08.849 --> 05:10.267
Yeah, I think so.

05:12.700 --> 05:13.963
Excuse me.

05:15.588 --> 05:17.299
Hi, we're with the FBI.

05:17.384 --> 05:20.564
Uh, have you heard from
Kevin McGuire recently?

05:21.049 --> 05:22.432
Kevin?
Nah.

05:22.517 --> 05:24.337
- I don't really know him.
- Really?

05:24.439 --> 05:27.840
He's in this bar all the time.
You never talked to him?

05:27.924 --> 05:29.174
Not really.

05:29.525 --> 05:31.235
Leah Ritter, right?

05:35.736 --> 05:38.393
You know it's a crime
to lie to federal agents?

05:41.760 --> 05:44.166
I didn't think
he was gonna kill anybody.

05:44.723 --> 05:45.931
Okay.

05:46.401 --> 05:48.525
Why don't you back up,
tell us what happened,

05:48.627 --> 05:49.955
from the beginning?

05:51.447 --> 05:54.617
I started seeing Kevin
a few months ago.

05:54.853 --> 05:57.589
Thought he was a good guy,
rough around the edges.

05:57.674 --> 06:00.213
But, uh, he came to me
a few days ago,

06:00.748 --> 06:03.049
said some guy offered him
a big job,

06:03.250 --> 06:05.791
quick and easy
and a huge payday.

06:06.163 --> 06:08.039
He say who
was financing this?

06:08.124 --> 06:10.853
No, just that
it was a lot of money,

06:11.467 --> 06:13.846
said that it was gonna change
our lives.

06:14.377 --> 06:16.939
He asked me to drive him up
to that factory,

06:17.131 --> 06:19.228
follow the truck
until it broke down.

06:20.728 --> 06:23.533
I just thought he was gonna
steal something,

06:24.522 --> 06:26.721
but then he shot
those poor men.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.846
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

06:30.641 --> 06:33.391
I froze.
I didn't know what to do.

06:34.010 --> 06:37.160
I stayed in the car until Kevin
got the truck up and running,

06:37.243 --> 06:39.736
and then he just drove off.

06:40.672 --> 06:42.806
You have any idea
where he went?

06:42.891 --> 06:45.625
No, he just left me there.

06:45.710 --> 06:48.556
Never checked in,
isn't answering my calls.

06:49.025 --> 06:50.314
What phone is he using?

06:50.402 --> 06:53.533
Some, uh, burner phone
he got at the corner store.

06:54.424 --> 06:56.987
Um, I mean,
you can check my phone.

06:57.072 --> 06:58.639
The number is...
Is in there.

07:01.533 --> 07:03.142
What happens next?

07:04.773 --> 07:06.431
Leah, two people are dead.

07:06.814 --> 07:08.861
We'll let the U.S. Attorney
know you cooperated,

07:08.946 --> 07:12.908
but you're looking at
a second-degree murder charge.

07:19.928 --> 07:20.923
Tell me.

07:21.008 --> 07:22.537
Leah's call history
confirms her story.

07:22.622 --> 07:24.123
She tried calling McGuire
a dozen times

07:24.207 --> 07:25.111
after the hijacking.

07:25.196 --> 07:27.017
His number is registered
to a burner

07:27.102 --> 07:28.869
purchased near
the Rowdy Barrel.

07:29.166 --> 07:30.681
Did you get a location
from the phone?

07:30.766 --> 07:33.189
Yeah, it's pinging up
around Armonk.

07:34.002 --> 07:35.584
All right, all right!

07:37.553 --> 07:39.013
You sure we're in
the right place?

07:39.097 --> 07:40.473
Trust me, Maggie.

07:40.596 --> 07:42.975
Three years in Army intel,
I can read a sat map.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.954
I think,
this is the Riddiford truck.

07:48.257 --> 07:49.841
Yup.

08:14.474 --> 08:15.642
He's gone!

08:18.719 --> 08:20.513
Nowhere to go around here,
maybe he made the deal

08:20.596 --> 08:22.507
and got a ride back
to the city with the buyer.

08:23.380 --> 08:25.591
The latch is still open.

08:32.607 --> 08:33.798
Guns are still here.

08:41.807 --> 08:43.850
FBI!
Hands where I can see them!

09:04.028 --> 09:05.029
Okay?

09:05.130 --> 09:06.755
So Kevin McGuire
kills two people

09:06.840 --> 09:08.716
to steal a truck full of guns,

09:08.851 --> 09:10.436
and then someone
kills Kevin McGuire,

09:10.568 --> 09:11.861
but no one takes any guns?

09:12.014 --> 09:14.266
Weren't after the guns.
After the ammo.

09:14.351 --> 09:15.911
Well, according
to this manifest.

09:16.011 --> 09:17.762
There are four crates of M995

09:17.847 --> 09:19.692
black tip rounds missing.

09:20.181 --> 09:21.583
Black tips?

09:22.110 --> 09:23.653
Those are hardcore,
armor-piercing,

09:23.738 --> 09:25.281
made for law enforcement
and military.

09:25.426 --> 09:27.762
So whoever stole this ammo
is up to something pretty big.

09:28.012 --> 09:29.722
Big enough to kill
three people.

09:31.481 --> 09:32.951
We passed a gas station
on the way.

09:33.036 --> 09:34.756
I'm gonna see if they have
security cameras.

09:40.008 --> 09:41.972
Only three vehicles went
down the dead-end road

09:42.057 --> 09:43.058
after the hijacking:

09:43.143 --> 09:43.911
the gun truck,

09:43.996 --> 09:45.856
a sedan that's registered
to an older woman

09:45.941 --> 09:47.818
who lives there,
and this van.

09:48.090 --> 09:49.442
License plates are fake.

09:49.527 --> 09:50.981
It goes down the road
ten minutes

09:51.066 --> 09:52.341
behind the Riddiford truck,

09:52.426 --> 09:54.386
and comes back
15 minutes after.

09:54.719 --> 09:56.095
All right, check it out.

09:56.373 --> 09:57.450
Ian enhanced the footage,

09:57.535 --> 09:58.787
we got a clear shot
of the driver.

09:58.871 --> 10:02.520
Facial rec ID'd him
as Nur Rojak.

10:05.299 --> 10:06.755
Who's Nur Rojak?

10:06.850 --> 10:09.103
He was a member
of Negara Islamiyah Asia,

10:09.227 --> 10:10.303
Southeast Asian terror group,

10:10.387 --> 10:12.341
but they're out
of business now.

10:12.426 --> 10:14.161
Thanks in no small part
to OA.

10:14.426 --> 10:16.412
I was involved
in the military op

10:16.497 --> 10:18.007
that took out their leader,
Sulaiman Mansor,

10:18.091 --> 10:19.939
five years ago.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.114
Without Mansor,
the NIA fell apart.

10:22.315 --> 10:25.109
So, what is Nur doing
in the United States now?

10:25.194 --> 10:26.709
Well, can't tell you
what he's doing here yet,

10:26.793 --> 10:28.462
but we know how he got the van.

10:28.547 --> 10:30.322
Thrifty-Haul depot
up in Bronxville.

10:30.407 --> 10:32.451
Managers said he rented it
a few weeks back,

10:32.606 --> 10:34.466
returned it this morning.

10:34.815 --> 10:37.484
Okay.
You two, head up there.

10:39.559 --> 10:42.106
<i>Returned it
yesterday morning.</i>

10:45.047 --> 10:46.257
Are you seeing anything?

10:46.340 --> 10:47.998
Nothing but
the owner's manual,

10:48.083 --> 10:49.802
company insurance records.

10:49.885 --> 10:51.435
ERT's 20 minutes out.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.748
We can have them sweep
for prints, stray fibers,

10:53.833 --> 10:56.262
but car looks like
it's been wiped clean.

10:59.409 --> 11:01.020
Maybe not the whole car.

11:02.469 --> 11:03.721
What is that?

11:03.899 --> 11:05.716
Looks like
some kind of paint.

11:08.213 --> 11:09.958
We'll have the lab run it.

11:11.458 --> 11:13.567
The blue paint on the van's
tires contained DDT.

11:13.652 --> 11:16.670
- It's the anti-fouling paint.
- What's antifouling paint?

11:16.755 --> 11:18.815
Uh, they use it on the hulls
of commercial ships.

11:18.905 --> 11:21.287
- Keeps the barnacles off.
- Okay, so that's good, right?

11:21.372 --> 11:22.927
There's not that many
commercial ports in the area.

11:23.011 --> 11:24.597
No, there aren't,
and there are even fewer

11:24.681 --> 11:26.092
doing restorations right now.

11:26.177 --> 11:27.404
I called around to see
if any of them

11:27.488 --> 11:29.382
- had seen Nur or the van.
- And did you get a hit?

11:29.466 --> 11:31.098
Yes, a shipyard in Brooklyn,

11:31.183 --> 11:32.510
has a record
of the van's fake plates

11:32.594 --> 11:34.054
coming through last week.

11:34.138 --> 11:35.264
Nice.

11:38.066 --> 11:39.359
According to our logs,

11:39.444 --> 11:41.070
that van was here
last Wednesday.

11:41.270 --> 11:43.036
They picked up a load
from this container.

11:43.121 --> 11:44.372
They?

11:44.457 --> 11:46.125
How many people
were with that van?

11:46.210 --> 11:47.920
I'm not sure.
Two or three guys?

11:48.048 --> 11:49.841
Not the friendly-looking type.

11:50.403 --> 11:52.123
Do you have any
security camera footage

11:52.208 --> 11:53.866
- from that pickup?
- No, sorry.

11:53.949 --> 11:55.534
We don't have cameras
all the way back here.

11:58.120 --> 12:01.290
Okay, we're gonna need you
to open this container.

12:08.058 --> 12:09.476
What the hell?

12:16.419 --> 12:18.390
Someone's been living here.

12:34.390 --> 12:36.059
Marek guns, huh?

12:38.597 --> 12:39.951
Well, Nur smuggled in guns

12:40.036 --> 12:41.506
compatible with
the stolen ammo.

12:41.591 --> 12:43.342
Explains why he left
the weapons on the truck.

12:43.426 --> 12:44.364
Go through all this trouble,

12:44.449 --> 12:46.375
why not just put the ammo
in the shipping container?

12:46.459 --> 12:47.579
Well, guns are easier
to hide.

12:47.663 --> 12:49.248
Customs and Border Patrol
have machines

12:49.333 --> 12:50.751
that can detect explosives,

12:50.836 --> 12:52.419
so the ammo would've
triggered that.

12:53.692 --> 12:54.927
Right.
Hey, Jubal, it's Maggie.

12:55.010 --> 12:58.263
Listen, we need an ERT team
at the shipyard right away.

12:58.919 --> 13:00.122
Yup.

13:00.294 --> 13:02.338
Hey, turns out
you two were right.

13:02.423 --> 13:04.217
Someone was living
in that shipping container.

13:04.301 --> 13:06.700
ERT found sweat, hair,
and skin cells.

13:06.795 --> 13:09.715
OA, DNA evidence
came back to Mansor.

13:10.025 --> 13:11.294
What?

13:11.426 --> 13:15.622
Mansor, wait, the dead
terrorist leader of the NIA?

13:16.153 --> 13:17.185
That's impossible.

13:17.270 --> 13:18.575
I was there
when we bombed his compound.

13:18.659 --> 13:19.575
I know.

13:19.660 --> 13:21.121
Listen, we're not jumping
to conclusions here.

13:21.205 --> 13:23.779
All we do know right now
is that his genetic material

13:23.864 --> 13:25.122
was in that container.

13:25.207 --> 13:27.960
Which means either someone
planted it to toy with us...

13:28.045 --> 13:29.960
Yeah, or we got
a master terrorist loose

13:30.045 --> 13:32.423
in New York City with
a cache of automatic weapons.

13:40.997 --> 13:42.200
Yes, sir.

13:42.509 --> 13:44.302
Talk soon.

13:44.871 --> 13:47.137
That was the Deputy Director,
he flew in.

13:47.222 --> 13:49.122
Task force
is gathering in ten.

13:49.669 --> 13:50.934
What does that mean?

13:51.881 --> 13:53.544
You think Mansor
is actually here?

13:53.629 --> 13:55.864
Lab found a bucket
in the shipping container

13:55.949 --> 13:57.826
that was used as a toilet
on the trip over.

13:57.911 --> 14:01.239
Bodily fluids are recent,
forensics are conclusive.

14:01.324 --> 14:03.034
Mansor was in that container

14:03.119 --> 14:06.208
as recently as last week
and alive.

14:13.681 --> 14:15.169
That's not possible.

14:16.069 --> 14:18.905
We had visual confirmation.
We ordered the hit.

14:19.006 --> 14:20.602
I was there.
I saw it with my own eyes.

14:20.687 --> 14:21.968
We got him.

14:23.652 --> 14:25.237
Isobel.

14:25.524 --> 14:26.551
We got him.

14:26.636 --> 14:30.038
OA, it has been confirmed.
He is alive.

14:36.303 --> 14:39.077
Look, why don't you come to
the task force meeting with us?

14:39.463 --> 14:41.006
We're gonna lay out
a game plan,

14:41.091 --> 14:43.351
and we could use
your familiarity with the case.

14:48.411 --> 14:49.718
Yeah.

15:05.577 --> 15:06.898
Brooks.

15:08.454 --> 15:09.804
What are you doing here?

15:10.592 --> 15:12.996
I'm working for Joint Special
Operations Command.

15:13.081 --> 15:14.562
They sent me to help
with the case.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.546
You two know each other?

15:16.630 --> 15:18.484
Yeah, we were in
the same Army Intel unit.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.944
We actually worked
the Mansor op together.

15:21.029 --> 15:22.864
Hmm, good to know
we have so many people

15:22.949 --> 15:24.515
from the original team.

15:24.974 --> 15:27.796
Deputy Director Van Leer,
thank you for joining us.

15:27.992 --> 15:33.248
You have NYPD, CIA, NSA,
DHS, Military Intel,

15:33.333 --> 15:35.919
and of course representatives
from our office.

15:36.063 --> 15:37.538
Thank you all for coming.

15:37.698 --> 15:39.444
Director's aware
of the situation,

15:39.528 --> 15:40.758
and he's spoken
to the White House.

15:40.842 --> 15:42.552
You'll have
whatever resources you need.

15:42.846 --> 15:44.249
What do we know so far?

15:44.334 --> 15:47.087
Mansor's key ally is a guy
named Nur Rojak.

15:47.172 --> 15:49.710
He's a midlevel NIA member
who has been

15:49.795 --> 15:51.984
in the United States
at least two weeks.

15:52.069 --> 15:53.468
He rented a cargo van,

15:53.553 --> 15:55.257
drove to the shipyard
to pick up Mansor

15:55.342 --> 15:57.788
and the automatic rifles
that he smuggled in

15:57.873 --> 15:59.405
from Indonesia
last Wednesday.

15:59.490 --> 16:01.131
Then, early this morning,

16:01.270 --> 16:04.452
Nur stole compatible,
armor-piercing ammunition.

16:04.725 --> 16:07.741
He went to return the cargo van
around 10:00 a.m.,

16:07.826 --> 16:09.358
and from there,
the trail goes cold.

16:09.443 --> 16:12.905
We do not know where Nur
or Mansor are currently staying

16:13.019 --> 16:14.272
or what they're planning.

16:14.357 --> 16:16.151
This goes without saying,

16:16.236 --> 16:18.947
but the Mansor raid
was a very public victory

16:19.040 --> 16:20.503
for the United States.

16:20.595 --> 16:24.603
The entire nation watched that
bombing replay on television,

16:24.830 --> 16:27.284
the President gave speeches,
military awarded medals.

16:27.369 --> 16:30.175
So, for a number of reasons,

16:30.260 --> 16:33.889
it's important that we keep
Mansor's name out of this.

16:34.217 --> 16:36.573
We operate
on a need-to-know basis,

16:36.658 --> 16:38.056
keep everything buttoned up.

16:38.141 --> 16:39.977
Any information we uncover

16:40.062 --> 16:42.064
should be considered
highly classified.

16:42.207 --> 16:43.627
Understood, sir.

16:44.587 --> 16:46.017
Thank you.

17:02.898 --> 17:04.431
Hey, you got a second?

17:04.538 --> 17:05.830
Yeah.

17:05.976 --> 17:07.989
I've just been thinking
about all this

17:08.074 --> 17:09.782
and it still doesn't
make any sense.

17:09.867 --> 17:11.493
What doesn't make sense?

17:12.770 --> 17:14.892
What happened
on the Mansor op.

17:17.215 --> 17:19.198
Look, I don't know
what you want me to say.

17:19.281 --> 17:21.034
I just want you
to tell me the truth.

17:21.439 --> 17:23.233
We bombed a building,
the place was demolished,

17:23.317 --> 17:26.362
everyone inside
was completely incinerated.

17:26.446 --> 17:28.406
Nobody...

17:33.001 --> 17:34.920
Mansor obviously
wasn't in there.

17:35.005 --> 17:37.705
So whatever you thought you saw
or said you saw was inaccurate.

17:43.282 --> 17:47.244
Look, I had eyes
on, uh, Mansor's wife,

17:47.739 --> 17:49.616
his younger brother, and, uh...

17:49.701 --> 17:50.785
And, uh?

17:51.689 --> 17:54.400
And another man.
Same age, same size.

17:55.697 --> 17:57.415
Terry, what the hell
are you saying?

17:57.728 --> 17:59.626
That intel said that Mansor
never traveled

17:59.709 --> 18:01.711
without his wife
and his younger brother.

18:01.795 --> 18:03.046
Never.

18:03.533 --> 18:06.166
So I figured that third guy
had to be him.

18:07.103 --> 18:09.052
You figured?

18:09.603 --> 18:11.939
You didn't actually
identify him?

18:13.080 --> 18:16.112
I did what I thought
was right for the operation

18:16.204 --> 18:17.680
and for the country.

18:17.765 --> 18:19.749
Look, it was
a split-second decision.

18:19.865 --> 18:22.518
Okay, we sat on that house
for a year,

18:22.618 --> 18:24.534
we saw couriers
running in and out,

18:24.619 --> 18:27.010
we had dozens of signs
that Mansor was living inside.

18:27.095 --> 18:28.738
So what, you thought,
"Close enough"?

18:28.822 --> 18:29.948
No.

18:30.205 --> 18:31.575
Look, I don't... I don't...
I don't know.

18:31.658 --> 18:34.088
Maybe it was confirmation bias.

18:34.173 --> 18:35.455
I just saw
what I wanted to see.

18:35.540 --> 18:38.142
Okay, well, that sighting
is what got General Carson

18:38.543 --> 18:40.749
to sign off on a bombing.

18:40.834 --> 18:42.586
I know.
I know.

18:42.669 --> 18:43.920
The wife, the brother,

18:44.004 --> 18:46.423
innocent people
were killed, man.

18:46.980 --> 18:48.425
And that was hard enough
to deal with when we thought

18:48.508 --> 18:50.093
we took out
our biggest terror threat,

18:50.176 --> 18:52.295
but now it turns out
he wasn't even there?

18:52.380 --> 18:53.881
OA, I'm sorry.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.932
You understand
what you've done, right?

18:56.450 --> 19:00.145
Because when we thought we took
out Mansor, we stopped looking,

19:00.638 --> 19:03.490
and he used that cover
to plan something here.

19:03.638 --> 19:07.755
If he pulls that off,
that blood is on our hands.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.002
Come on, people.

19:18.087 --> 19:20.420
Mansor orchestrated
devastating hotel bombings

19:20.505 --> 19:22.553
that killed hundreds
of tourists overseas,

19:22.638 --> 19:23.881
assassinated politicians,

19:23.966 --> 19:26.014
and destabilized
U.S.-backed governments.

19:26.099 --> 19:27.389
Now he's on U.S. soil,

19:27.474 --> 19:28.820
and it's up to us
to track him down.

19:28.904 --> 19:30.498
Where is he?
What is he planning?

19:30.583 --> 19:31.593
Let's go, let's go!

19:31.676 --> 19:33.787
- Hey, Jubal.
- Yeah, go.

19:33.880 --> 19:35.828
Homeland Security got a hit
in their customs records.

19:35.912 --> 19:36.944
And?

19:37.029 --> 19:38.732
The shipping container
Mansor was living in

19:38.817 --> 19:40.342
was supposed to be
carrying a shipment

19:40.427 --> 19:41.772
of chiropractic equipment.

19:41.888 --> 19:43.522
Adjustment tables,
medicine balls,

19:43.607 --> 19:44.655
that kind of thing.

19:44.740 --> 19:46.123
It was headed
for a company called

19:46.208 --> 19:47.849
Khan Superior Chiropractic.

19:47.934 --> 19:49.225
It's a family-owned company.

19:49.310 --> 19:50.858
They have several offices
throughout the tristate,

19:50.942 --> 19:52.342
but they're headquartered
here in the city.

19:52.426 --> 19:55.077
They've also sponsored
five visas in the last year,

19:55.162 --> 19:57.427
all for chiropractors
from Southeast Asia.

19:57.590 --> 20:00.272
Yeah, we ran those visa
photos through facial rec.

20:00.357 --> 20:02.021
The names on the visas
are fake.

20:02.106 --> 20:04.857
Credentials are falsified.
They're all former NIA.

20:05.044 --> 20:06.836
Flew under the radar
until now.

20:07.005 --> 20:08.919
The NIA is getting
the band back together

20:09.005 --> 20:10.674
here in New York.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.280
- So where are they?
- Don't know.

20:13.365 --> 20:15.335
The addresses they gave
customs are all bogus.

20:15.420 --> 20:16.930
All right, well,
let's get someone down

20:17.013 --> 20:19.647
to that chiropractic office,
see what they're up to.

20:27.857 --> 20:29.025
No.

20:29.490 --> 20:31.152
These men don't work for me.

20:31.467 --> 20:32.821
You sure?

20:32.904 --> 20:35.303
Because your company
sponsored their work visas.

20:35.420 --> 20:37.959
Helped smuggle them into
the country under fake names.

20:38.114 --> 20:40.131
Your signature
is on the paperwork.

20:40.225 --> 20:41.600
That's not possible.

20:41.685 --> 20:43.975
Is there anyone else with
access to that information?

20:44.164 --> 20:46.553
Maybe an accountant,
office manager?

20:46.639 --> 20:48.482
No, we're family-run.

20:48.943 --> 20:51.959
My son and I handle
the bookkeeping ourselves.

20:54.634 --> 20:56.553
Is your son here now?

21:04.281 --> 21:05.687
Daniel Khan.

21:19.325 --> 21:21.333
Bad idea to run
from the FBI.

21:21.418 --> 21:23.474
Daniel Khan,
you're under arrest.

21:23.559 --> 21:24.700
For what?

21:24.785 --> 21:26.482
Well, right now,
being a pain in the ass,

21:26.567 --> 21:29.106
but by the time
we get down to 26 Fed,

21:29.191 --> 21:31.551
I'm sure we'll have something
a little more formal.

21:37.138 --> 21:38.556
Guys.

21:38.738 --> 21:41.893
OA, given your knowledge
of Mansor and the NIA,

21:41.976 --> 21:44.457
I want you to interrogate Khan
with Scola.

21:44.542 --> 21:46.324
Yeah, sounds good.
What do we know about him?

21:46.409 --> 21:47.582
He's 30 years old,

21:47.667 --> 21:49.410
second-generation
Indonesian American,

21:49.495 --> 21:50.713
very westernized upbringing.

21:50.798 --> 21:52.918
Grew up in the city, got his
business degree from Syracuse.

21:53.002 --> 21:54.321
Now he's making six figures

21:54.406 --> 21:56.324
working for his dad's
chiropractic company.

21:56.409 --> 21:57.860
That doesn't sound
so bad.

21:57.947 --> 22:00.587
So why's a wealthy American kid
helping out the NIA?

22:00.680 --> 22:02.352
Is it some kind
of financial kickback?

22:02.437 --> 22:05.023
No, if anything,
he spent family money

22:05.108 --> 22:07.527
to facilitate the visas,
the shipping container.

22:07.639 --> 22:09.933
- Any issues within the family?
- Doesn't appear to be.

22:10.088 --> 22:11.665
Father seems like a decent guy,

22:11.750 --> 22:13.210
Says they have
a good relationship.

22:13.504 --> 22:16.321
But outside of the family,
Khan's had a rough time of it.

22:16.576 --> 22:18.094
I pulled his
high school records.

22:18.194 --> 22:19.470
Kid got his ass kicked,

22:19.555 --> 22:20.900
ends up in the hospital
a few times,

22:20.984 --> 22:22.277
got so bad the parents ended up

22:22.362 --> 22:23.906
filing a lawsuit
against the school.

22:23.991 --> 22:26.243
Dad says he got more isolated
as he got older.

22:26.349 --> 22:29.469
Trouble with his peers,
easy target for radicalization.

22:29.596 --> 22:31.390
Do we know how he got
connected with the NIA?

22:31.475 --> 22:33.326
We think
he was recruited online.

22:33.528 --> 22:34.763
Oh, yeah.

22:34.848 --> 22:36.656
I mean, he started out
by looking for information

22:36.739 --> 22:38.366
about the town where
his grandparents lived,

22:38.449 --> 22:40.896
then he started looking into
his ancestors, his roots.

22:40.981 --> 22:42.858
Somewhere along the way,
he took a wrong turn.

22:42.943 --> 22:45.112
He ended up
on the NIA website,

22:45.289 --> 22:46.553
got swept up in the propaganda.

22:46.678 --> 22:47.810
That's their MO.

22:47.895 --> 22:49.608
Find a lonely kid
with a shaky identity,

22:49.693 --> 22:51.537
promise him a community
and a purpose.

22:51.629 --> 22:53.297
And then tear it all down.

22:53.381 --> 22:55.007
Mm.
Got enough to work with?

22:55.091 --> 22:56.676
Yeah.

22:58.719 --> 23:01.013
You know, I understand
wanting to know more

23:01.097 --> 23:02.617
about where you come from,

23:02.702 --> 23:04.637
all right, your heritage,
your religion.

23:05.768 --> 23:07.457
But the irony is that
you screwed over

23:07.542 --> 23:09.086
the one person
who could actually answer

23:09.170 --> 23:10.473
those questions for you.

23:11.233 --> 23:14.128
You signed your dad's name
on all the paperwork

23:14.276 --> 23:17.071
for the fraudulent visas,
the shipping container.

23:17.155 --> 23:19.240
He's legally responsible
for these men

23:19.323 --> 23:20.700
being in the United States.

23:20.783 --> 23:22.065
He has nothing to do
with this.

23:22.217 --> 23:25.303
Everything comes back
to his chiropractic office.

23:25.573 --> 23:29.119
So if the NIA commits
a terrorist attack,

23:29.204 --> 23:32.479
your dad will spend the rest of
his life in a federal prison.

23:33.671 --> 23:35.776
After everything
that he's built here,

23:36.155 --> 23:39.198
the life that he made for you,

23:40.303 --> 23:41.878
you used him.

23:43.119 --> 23:44.895
And the NIA is using you.

23:45.183 --> 23:46.559
No, I'm working for them

23:46.642 --> 23:48.242
because I believe in
what they stand for.

23:48.417 --> 23:49.745
What they stand for?

23:50.933 --> 23:52.560
They're terrorists, Daniel.

23:52.645 --> 23:53.596
They're not.

23:53.681 --> 23:55.901
They're fighting
for their people, my people.

23:55.986 --> 23:58.737
They're killers.
Nothing more.

24:00.156 --> 24:01.574
This is Abba Haris.

24:01.657 --> 24:03.576
He helped the NIA set up
a hotel bombing in Jakarta.

24:03.659 --> 24:05.244
Hundreds were killed.

24:05.328 --> 24:07.288
This is Soraya Rahman,
just 15 years old.

24:07.371 --> 24:09.749
Acted as a scout
for a high-level assassination.

24:09.832 --> 24:11.584
This is Siska Abdul,
a young mother

24:11.667 --> 24:13.544
who worked
in the Australian embassy

24:13.628 --> 24:15.087
as a mole
before they bombed it.

24:15.171 --> 24:18.591
And this is Kevin McGuire,
a fellow New Yorker

24:18.674 --> 24:20.760
who helped them get supplies
for whatever it is

24:20.843 --> 24:23.429
they are planning here
just this morning.

24:26.515 --> 24:27.762
They all helped the NIA,

24:27.847 --> 24:30.850
and they were all
brutally murdered

24:31.075 --> 24:32.895
after they served
their purpose.

24:34.857 --> 24:38.114
Hey!
Don't look away.

24:39.553 --> 24:42.028
Look at this.
Huh?

24:42.421 --> 24:46.005
This is what happens
to people that help them,

24:46.300 --> 24:48.511
and this is what
is gonna happen to you!

24:51.208 --> 24:52.614
It's okay.

24:59.106 --> 25:01.676
The NIA aren't
your people, Daniel.

25:04.466 --> 25:05.848
Your dad?

25:07.848 --> 25:10.903
That's who you come from.

25:11.394 --> 25:13.833
You really want
to sacrifice him...

25:16.195 --> 25:17.654
For this?

25:21.404 --> 25:23.255
I didn't mean to hurt him.

25:23.864 --> 25:26.701
Please, you have to
keep him out of it.

25:26.784 --> 25:29.348
You want to protect him?
Yeah?

25:29.620 --> 25:31.387
Then you work with us
and you help us stop

25:31.472 --> 25:33.341
whatever the NIA is planning.

25:34.946 --> 25:36.458
Where's Mansor staying?

25:37.012 --> 25:39.130
- I don't know.
- What is the NIA targeting?

25:39.213 --> 25:41.299
I don't know.
I swear, I'm sorry.

25:41.382 --> 25:42.919
They didn't tell me
any of that.

25:44.512 --> 25:46.981
Okay.
Tell us what you do know.

25:50.425 --> 25:51.848
Mansor's coming.

25:52.061 --> 25:54.981
There's gonna be an attack,
but I don't know what.

25:55.239 --> 25:57.006
They say I have a part to play,

25:57.091 --> 25:59.358
but they didn't want to give me
the details online.

25:59.442 --> 26:02.528
And I was supposed to meet
one of them tomorrow.

26:02.907 --> 26:04.196
Where?

26:10.595 --> 26:12.597
Hey, OA, what just happened?

26:14.733 --> 26:16.610
- What're you talking about?
- You.

26:16.695 --> 26:18.414
I thought that you
were gonna hit the kid.

26:18.540 --> 26:21.282
I mean, what the hell
is going on?

26:23.632 --> 26:25.649
I don't know, Scola.

26:26.121 --> 26:29.282
Maybe I'm just a little
confused and upset.

26:30.332 --> 26:33.084
I spent my entire career
in the Army going after Mansor.

26:33.309 --> 26:35.947
And we got him.
We blew up his house.

26:36.032 --> 26:37.961
I have a medal on my desk
to prove it,

26:38.046 --> 26:39.696
and then five years later,
what, it never happened?

26:39.780 --> 26:41.782
It was all a lie?

26:45.289 --> 26:46.993
That promotion is what
got me here.

26:47.078 --> 26:48.633
It's what got me this job.

26:50.742 --> 26:52.406
That's what the hell's
going on.

27:08.695 --> 27:11.555
- You got eyes and ears?
- Yes, copy.

27:11.695 --> 27:14.265
<i>- You got me as well?</i>
- Yeah, we got you, Scola.

27:14.403 --> 27:16.782
Okay,
Khan is walking towards us,

27:16.867 --> 27:18.771
but no sign of his contact.

27:21.609 --> 27:22.898
You okay?

27:23.968 --> 27:25.664
Yeah.
Why?

27:26.529 --> 27:28.437
You just seem a little tense.

27:29.333 --> 27:31.794
Well, that is because I am.

27:35.704 --> 27:38.791
Maggie, I just found out that
the biggest mission of my life

27:38.874 --> 27:40.297
was a complete lie.

27:40.417 --> 27:43.627
That my good friend,
who I also considered a hero,

27:43.712 --> 27:47.656
called in an air strike
and didn't even see the target.

27:48.284 --> 27:50.305
Yeah, that's pretty rough.

27:50.390 --> 27:53.679
Son of a bitch said
he saw Mansor.

27:54.389 --> 27:55.945
Saw him.

27:56.434 --> 27:59.703
But he didn't.
He lied.

28:01.054 --> 28:03.500
- Maybe.
- What do you mean?

28:03.585 --> 28:05.690
Well, maybe he just panicked,
you know,

28:05.775 --> 28:07.640
or he was trying too hard.

28:07.862 --> 28:12.023
There's a huge difference
between screwing up and lying.

28:13.033 --> 28:15.953
Look, you've been good friends
with him for a long time, yeah?

28:16.156 --> 28:17.665
You always thought
he was a good guy.

28:17.750 --> 28:20.422
- Yeah, so?
- Well, so maybe he still is.

28:20.875 --> 28:22.501
You know what it's like
in the field

28:22.585 --> 28:24.962
when you get rushed into
making a split-second decision.

28:25.429 --> 28:27.914
Well, guy made a bad call.

28:28.423 --> 28:29.867
Doesn't make him a bad guy.

28:32.422 --> 28:34.257
<i>I have eyes on Nur Rojak.</i>

28:34.342 --> 28:37.515
<i>He spotted Khan,
headed his way now.</i>

28:44.775 --> 28:48.195
Daniel Khan.
I'm Nur Rojak.

28:48.404 --> 28:49.858
Thank you for meeting me.

28:49.944 --> 28:52.613
<i>I've been looking forward
to this a long time.</i>

28:52.810 --> 28:54.458
<i>You've been
a valuable asset to us.</i>

28:54.992 --> 28:56.576
<i>Mansor is grateful.</i>

28:56.811 --> 28:59.021
<i>This mission
is very important to him.</i>

28:59.470 --> 29:01.841
- What is it?
- The mission.

29:01.958 --> 29:04.665
It's justice for the people
of Southeast Asia,

29:04.814 --> 29:06.485
<i>and for Mansor.</i>

29:07.050 --> 29:09.803
<i>Punishment for the tyrants
who slaughtered his family.</i>

29:10.423 --> 29:13.470
It's a wake-up call
for all Americans,

29:14.243 --> 29:16.313
<i>to show them
we will not be oppressed.</i>

29:17.851 --> 29:19.557
<i>I want to be part of it.</i>

29:20.087 --> 29:21.968
<i>Just tell me what I can do.</i>

29:23.488 --> 29:25.016
<i>You'll take a train north</i>

29:25.226 --> 29:26.993
<i>out of the city
this afternoon.</i>

29:27.149 --> 29:28.901
<i>Someone will meet you
at the station,</i>

29:28.984 --> 29:31.368
help you get into place
before the ceremony.

29:31.524 --> 29:35.087
<i>The ceremony?
Where are we going?</i>

29:35.658 --> 29:37.235
Patience.

29:37.430 --> 29:40.227
It'll be clear, in time.

29:42.180 --> 29:43.698
Khan is getting nervous.

29:43.791 --> 29:45.876
<i>I don't know if he's gonna
be able to pull this off.</i>

29:45.960 --> 29:47.384
- We should move in.
<i>- No.</i>

29:47.476 --> 29:49.180
If we take Nur,
we lose our link to Mansor.

29:49.265 --> 29:50.391
Just let it play out.

29:50.476 --> 29:51.665
Yeah, I'm not so
sure about that.

29:51.749 --> 29:53.884
No, I agree.
Let it play out.

29:53.968 --> 29:56.095
Come on.
This is the right play for now.

29:56.178 --> 29:58.055
Okay.

29:58.138 --> 30:00.599
<i>What do you need me
to do, exactly?</i>

30:00.683 --> 30:02.679
Are there limits to what
you're willing to do?

30:02.764 --> 30:04.223
No, I-I...

30:04.473 --> 30:07.434
I just want to make sure
that I'm prepared.

30:07.802 --> 30:10.179
I got trackers on Khan.
We won't lose him.

30:10.337 --> 30:12.589
And you're prepared to do
whatever Mansor needs?

30:12.830 --> 30:15.882
Yes, I want to
make him proud.

30:18.640 --> 30:21.054
I'm not sure you're worthy
of such an honor.

30:21.536 --> 30:22.912
<i>He's not buying it.</i>

30:23.132 --> 30:26.083
Peace be upon you,
brother.

30:26.250 --> 30:28.007
Damn it.

30:43.142 --> 30:45.853
- Where the hell is he?
- <i>We lost him.</i>

30:55.463 --> 30:57.670
Nur Rojak,
our best shot at Mansor,

30:57.755 --> 30:59.298
has been in the wind
15 minutes.

30:59.382 --> 31:01.509
He did not just disappear
into thin air, where did he go?

31:01.593 --> 31:03.102
- Ann, any hits?
- Not yet.

31:03.187 --> 31:05.297
But we've got a dozen officers
on the ground,

31:05.382 --> 31:06.603
going door-to-door
in that neighborhood.

31:06.687 --> 31:08.485
No luck with
security cameras either.

31:08.570 --> 31:11.048
Try transit hubs,
train stations, bus stops,

31:11.133 --> 31:12.228
boat houses,
you know the drill.

31:12.312 --> 31:14.196
Hey, what about the messaging
board where Khan was recruited?

31:14.280 --> 31:15.352
Any chatter
we can work with?

31:15.436 --> 31:17.689
No, it's a dead zone.
NIA's gone quiet.

31:18.061 --> 31:19.156
Come on, people.

31:19.241 --> 31:21.476
We know Mansor
is planning something,

31:21.630 --> 31:23.054
and based on what
Nur said to Khan,

31:23.139 --> 31:25.420
it's likely happening today...
We are running out of time!

31:25.852 --> 31:28.438
Somebody give me something.
Uh, he said ceremony.

31:28.523 --> 31:29.540
When Nur was talking
to Khan,

31:29.624 --> 31:30.774
it sounds like
he's going after an event.

31:30.858 --> 31:32.902
North of the city.
Accessible by train.

31:33.017 --> 31:35.773
And he mentioned revenge,
the murder of Mansor's family.

31:35.905 --> 31:37.609
Sounds like it's connected
to the bombing.

31:37.724 --> 31:39.429
He's going to West Point.

31:39.812 --> 31:41.391
General Carson
is the dean there now,

31:41.476 --> 31:42.453
but more importantly,
he's the one

31:42.537 --> 31:43.738
that signed off on the attack.

31:43.842 --> 31:45.757
His name was all over the news,
became a legend.

31:45.842 --> 31:49.023
Okay, but if Nur
mentioned ceremony, an event...

31:50.211 --> 31:51.476
The Ring Melt Ceremony.

31:51.976 --> 31:53.705
It's when the alums donate
their old class rings

31:53.789 --> 31:54.844
to the new seniors.

31:54.929 --> 31:55.800
Carson is hosting.

31:55.883 --> 31:57.368
I've been getting emails
about it all month.

31:57.452 --> 31:59.266
So Mansor goes after the man
who ordered the hit

31:59.350 --> 32:01.367
on his family and takes out
the newest class of America's

32:01.451 --> 32:03.203
mighty military university
in the process.

32:03.288 --> 32:04.553
That makes sense.
When is it?

32:04.638 --> 32:06.709
In an hour and a half
at the West Point campus.

32:06.826 --> 32:08.436
Go.

32:10.396 --> 32:11.592
Hey.

32:12.523 --> 32:14.232
You ready to get
back out there?

32:14.944 --> 32:16.764
Yeah, I'm good to go.

32:17.049 --> 32:18.300
Good.

32:29.751 --> 32:30.960
Ceremony starts
in seven minutes.

32:31.044 --> 32:32.211
It's okay, we have time.

32:32.295 --> 32:34.429
SWAT and the rest of the team are
already through the front gate.

32:34.513 --> 32:35.999
So we're just gonna lock down
the back gate,

32:36.083 --> 32:37.006
and take out the NIA

32:37.091 --> 32:38.397
before anyone even knows
they're here.

32:38.481 --> 32:41.279
Unless I'm wrong.
What if this isn't the target, Maggie?

32:48.770 --> 32:50.576
I spoke too soon.

33:05.100 --> 33:06.803
Bullet-resistant glass.

33:07.139 --> 33:08.724
Shot through
the vest plate.

33:08.956 --> 33:10.561
Explains
the armor-piercing ammo.

33:15.693 --> 33:18.383
Everyone, be advised.
The NIA are on campus.

33:18.466 --> 33:21.334
We need to get them quickly
and quietly, okay?

33:21.419 --> 33:22.844
And don't give them any reason
to start shooting.

33:22.928 --> 33:24.904
Our vests aren't gonna hold.

33:25.748 --> 33:27.529
Maggie,
do you know how they got in?

33:27.662 --> 33:29.560
<i>Yeah,
they shot two military police</i>

33:29.644 --> 33:30.937
<i>and blew through
the back gate.</i>

33:31.098 --> 33:33.428
Look, if no one has had eyes
on them yet,

33:33.513 --> 33:34.998
most likely
they're disguised.

33:35.106 --> 33:37.048
<i>So look for anybody
who looks like</i>

33:37.162 --> 33:38.569
<i>they're concealing
automatic weapons, okay?</i>

33:38.653 --> 33:40.475
<i>Duffels, uh, long coats.</i>

33:40.576 --> 33:42.369
Or instrument cases.

33:50.578 --> 33:53.706
- FBI, show me your hands.
- Don't even think about it.

34:08.963 --> 34:10.435
Guys, they're dressed
as musicians,

34:10.518 --> 34:12.562
hiding the vz.'s
in instrument cases.

34:24.677 --> 34:26.533
We have two more
heading into the ceremony.

34:26.618 --> 34:28.228
They just hopped out
of a black van,

34:28.313 --> 34:31.650
license India-Charlie-Whiskey,
one-zero-one-five.

34:34.389 --> 34:38.505
FBI, get on the ground!
Do not resist arrest.

34:39.121 --> 34:41.013
Drop your cases now!

34:46.065 --> 34:47.348
Get down on the ground!

34:47.433 --> 34:49.638
Let me see your hands.
Get down!

34:56.302 --> 34:58.888
Both of you,
down on the ground!

35:08.278 --> 35:09.654
Clear.

35:10.380 --> 35:11.646
Sorry.

35:20.922 --> 35:22.907
Maggie,
Nur Rojak is headed out

35:22.992 --> 35:24.008
of the back
of the auditorium.

35:24.091 --> 35:25.195
He's headed your way now.

35:25.295 --> 35:26.695
<i>Copy that.</i>

35:33.333 --> 35:34.999
FBI!
Drop it!

35:36.304 --> 35:38.938
Drop the phone!

35:43.944 --> 35:46.514
We've got Nur Rojak
and the five NIA members.

35:47.114 --> 35:48.756
Anyone have eyes on
Mansor?

36:00.404 --> 36:02.547
If we don't have Mansor yet,
we should evacuate now.

36:02.670 --> 36:04.340
<i>We don't even know
if Mansor's here.</i>

36:04.423 --> 36:05.969
<i>He could've activated
his guys from afar.</i>

36:06.053 --> 36:09.262
The NIA smuggled him into
this country, this is personal.

36:09.345 --> 36:12.557
He wants Carson to see him.
Isobel, we should call it.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.412
I'm with you.
Get them out of there now.

36:14.497 --> 36:15.707
<i>Copy that.
We're on it.</i>

36:17.812 --> 36:19.397
Hey, you guys gotta go, please.

36:19.480 --> 36:21.241
Guys, use the front exit.
Let's go.

36:21.326 --> 36:22.373
Guys, go, go.

36:22.458 --> 36:24.001
<i>Guys, please,
get to the front door.</i>

36:24.177 --> 36:25.595
<i>Let's go, please.</i>

36:30.214 --> 36:31.632
Guys, you gotta go,
now, please.

36:31.717 --> 36:33.772
Get out of the building,
please, quick.

36:34.662 --> 36:37.976
Scola, lower left.
Emily, upper left.

36:38.061 --> 36:39.417
Kristen, take the right.

36:39.500 --> 36:40.881
Okay, okay.

36:43.326 --> 36:45.264
<i>OA,
I've got eyes on Mansor.</i>

36:45.380 --> 36:47.030
- Are you sure?
<i>- I'm positive.</i>

36:47.115 --> 36:48.593
<i>He's in a military
police uniform,</i>

36:48.676 --> 36:50.335
<i>right side of the room,
he's headed for Carson.</i>

36:50.419 --> 36:52.115
I don't got a clean shot.

36:52.399 --> 36:53.609
OA?

37:00.920 --> 37:02.299
I have a shot,
but I can't see his face.

37:02.383 --> 37:03.826
Does anyone else
have eyes on him?

37:08.584 --> 37:10.031
It's a madhouse
down here, OA.

37:10.114 --> 37:11.600
<i>I can't see anything.</i>

37:11.866 --> 37:14.285
Look, OA, I know you don't
trust me right now,

37:14.368 --> 37:15.620
<i>but I'm looking right at him.</i>

37:15.803 --> 37:17.701
<i>It's Mansor.
I'm telling you.</i>

37:17.786 --> 37:19.538
<i>Take the shot.</i>

37:19.881 --> 37:21.553
Isobel, what do you
want me to do?

37:22.201 --> 37:24.054
I can't make that decision
from here.

37:24.139 --> 37:25.842
It has to be your call.

37:27.558 --> 37:29.602
Come on.
Turn around.

37:29.842 --> 37:31.636
Show me your face.
Come on.

37:31.719 --> 37:32.929
Come on.

37:34.803 --> 37:36.125
He's going for a gun.
Going for a gun!

37:36.209 --> 37:37.642
Take the shot!

37:39.560 --> 37:40.645
Move.
Come on, go on.

37:40.728 --> 37:41.812
Get out, get out.

37:41.896 --> 37:43.249
<i>Stay down.</i>

37:55.841 --> 37:57.200
It's Mansor.

37:57.411 --> 37:58.771
OA.

37:59.671 --> 38:01.173
You got him.

38:29.338 --> 38:30.862
So, mystery, huh?

38:42.119 --> 38:43.854
Hey, if you're ever in D.C...

38:43.947 --> 38:47.236
Yeah, I'll, uh...
I'll reach out.
