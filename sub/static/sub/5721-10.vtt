Brian...

00:40.640 --> 00:41.641
it's Cary.

00:41.690 --> 00:43.169
Thanks for pulling
an all-nighter.

00:43.210 --> 00:45.861
Um, Ethan Carver's coming in
an hour earlier today,

00:45.910 --> 00:47.639
so we should meet up
at 6:00 am. sharp.

[elevator bell dings]

01:00.750 --> 01:02.183
[speed dialing]

01:03.750 --> 01:05.536
Cedric, I just left
a message for Brian.

01:05.580 --> 01:07.366
I'm not sure if you guys
went home to take a shower

01:07.410 --> 01:08.445
or crashed on the 27th floor,

01:08.500 --> 01:10.968
but I got donuts
up here on the 28th.

[ringtone playing]

01:56.330 --> 01:59.379
Where the hell is my defendant?

01:59.420 --> 02:01.729
Your Honor...Oh, how I love to hear
those two words.

02:01.770 --> 02:04.113
But, Mrs. Florrick, if the next
word out of your mouth

02:04.160 --> 02:06.151
isn't "right here" or "dead,"

02:06.210 --> 02:07.461
then I will be
very upset.

02:07.510 --> 02:08.852
He's in surgery.

02:08.910 --> 02:10.901
Is that the let-century
equivalent of

02:10.950 --> 02:12.201
"my dog ate my homework"?

02:12.260 --> 02:14.216
No, he's literally
in surgery.
Really?

02:14.260 --> 02:16.160
That's one of those words that
doesn't often mean "literally."

02:16.220 --> 02:19.303
For example,
I am literally thunderstruck.

02:19.350 --> 02:20.908
Was he in
an aCCIdent?

02:20.960 --> 02:22.825
No, sir.
He's performing the operation.

02:22.880 --> 02:24.689
Ah, all is becoming
clear to me now.

02:24.750 --> 02:27.184
Your client is a surgeon
and he has scheduled surgery

02:27.230 --> 02:29.539
on the day he's supposed to be
in court with me.

02:29.580 --> 02:31.184
No, Your Honor,
the surgery went long.

02:31.230 --> 02:33.186
Dr. _Portnow is one of the best
cardiac surgeons In the country.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.231
_And on trial_
for crImInal conspiracy.

02:35.280 --> 02:36.360
And he is in
the middle

02:36.410 --> 02:38.492
of operating on
a four-month-old baby...

02:38.540 --> 02:39.848
A jury's been empanelled.Yes.

02:39.890 --> 02:41.198
And my client has had this baby

02:41.240 --> 02:42.969
on the table with her chest open

02:43.030 --> 02:44.247
for the past
five hours.

02:44.290 --> 02:46.155
Your Honor, this is obscene.
It's staged.

02:46.200 --> 02:48.896
This surgery was
intended to go long

02:48.950 --> 02:52.204
so you would wonder how a doctor
could do such villainous things.

02:52.250 --> 02:54.161
That is not true,
Matan.
That's exactly...

02:54.210 --> 02:56.075
The surgery went
two hours longer...Wait! Wait!

02:56.130 --> 02:57.688
Mrs. Florrick, your client

02:57.740 --> 02:59.469
had an appearance
time of 10:00 am.

02:59.520 --> 03:02.080
Now, I don't know
if this was staged or not,

03:02.130 --> 03:04.348
but I will treat your client
like he was any other.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.356
I am issuing a warrant
for Dr. Portnow.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.651
Your Honor,
this is...

03:07.700 --> 03:09.304
Sheriff,
please arrest Dr. Portnow

03:09.360 --> 03:12.227
as soon as he puts
down his scalpel.[gavel bangs]

03:21.150 --> 03:22.276
Seriously, David.

03:22.330 --> 03:23.228
What, you're worried
about offending them?

03:23.290 --> 03:25.019
Cary, could you
join us here?

03:25.070 --> 03:26.230
DAVID: Yes, can we talk about
the idiots you hired?

03:26.290 --> 03:27.245
Hey, I didn't hire
them by myself.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.632
I won't take
the blame...

03:28.680 --> 03:30.329
Well, I was only convinced
because you were saying...

03:30.380 --> 03:32.462
[talking over each other]Stop it! That's enough!

03:32.510 --> 03:34.205
Is there anybody left, Cary?

03:34.250 --> 03:35.854
From Dipple's team?
No.

03:35.910 --> 03:37.775
Typical Iw League morons.

03:37.820 --> 03:39.333
Let 'em in the door,
they foment a rebellion.

03:39.390 --> 03:41.255
All young associates are snakes.

03:41.300 --> 03:43.211
And you wonder
why they walked out.

03:43.260 --> 03:45.387
You're not seriously
blaming us?

03:45.440 --> 03:46.782
They just wanted good work.

03:46.830 --> 03:48.001
Which we gave them.Grudgingly.

03:48.050 --> 03:49.438
And only because
they were willing

03:49.490 --> 03:51.481
to _bust their asses on
a highly technIcal case.

03:51.530 --> 03:53.259
Hold on.
You got Dipple's man.

03:55.270 --> 03:57.352
How long can I say
to get this filed?

03:57.410 --> 04:00.095
Just a few hours.
I put together the strategy.

04:00.150 --> 04:01.879
The associates just ground out
the filing and the exhibits.

04:01.930 --> 04:02.885
Good.

04:02.930 --> 04:04.454
Wait.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.491
When you and Alicia
stole our clients...

04:06.550 --> 04:07.938
We didn't steal your clients.

04:07.980 --> 04:09.504
...didn't you purge
ongoing work product

04:09.550 --> 04:11.541
from our computers?

04:13.940 --> 04:15.282
I'll _check.
Listen.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.296
We have hundreds of pages

04:17.340 --> 04:18.591
of scientific explanations
and diagrams...

04:18.640 --> 04:20.426
I'll check.

04:23.300 --> 04:25.734
"AAMOF." What is that?

04:25.780 --> 04:27.953
"As a matter of fact."Oh.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.729
Mr. Carver, how are you?

04:29.790 --> 04:31.178
You know what I hate
about acronyms?

04:31.220 --> 04:32.744
They make you do all the work.

04:32.790 --> 04:33.916
It's not an acronym.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.837
An acronym has to form
another word.

04:35.880 --> 04:37.654
Like NATO.

04:37.710 --> 04:38.836
Really?

04:38.880 --> 04:40.438
We're arguing even
before we say hello?

04:40.490 --> 04:42.276
I said hello.

04:42.320 --> 04:44.049
Mr. Dipple is impressed
you're willing to take this on.

04:44.100 --> 04:46.660
Go out on a limb--
that's where the fruit is.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.585
ETHAN: So I can tell
Mr. Dipple we're set to file?

04:48.630 --> 04:52.191
Um... just give me one minute.

04:53.810 --> 04:56.028
They wiped them clean.

04:56.070 --> 04:57.549
Everything, all of
their work product.

04:57.600 --> 05:00.330
We need to talk, Cary.

05:00.380 --> 05:02.507
I'm not falling
on my sword

05:02.560 --> 05:04.516
for hiring people that
everybody wanted...

05:04.560 --> 05:05.993
That's not what this is about.

05:06.040 --> 05:07.348
You turned it into
a generational fight...

05:07.390 --> 05:08.823
It isa generational fight.

05:08.870 --> 05:10.952
...which blinded you to the fact
that they played you.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.046
They played you, Cary.

05:12.090 --> 05:13.569
No. No, you know what I see?

05:13.610 --> 05:15.521
I see you, David, Howard and
a half-dozen other partners

05:15.570 --> 05:17.299
froze the associates out.That's a complete
misrepresentation.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.136
And no matter why this happened,
you need to make it right, Cary.

05:20.180 --> 05:22.182
Now.

05:25.580 --> 05:28.879
The thought of you in here
with no view depresses me.

05:28.930 --> 05:31.012
This is an LA. artist,
Jose Ramirez.

05:31.060 --> 05:32.368
It's a little big.

05:32.410 --> 05:35.061
I wanted you to be
swallowed up in it.

05:35.110 --> 05:36.543
Oh, that won't
be a problem.

05:36.590 --> 05:37.898
[chuckles]

05:37.940 --> 05:39.282
So how are we?

05:39.330 --> 05:42.026
Are we good?

05:42.080 --> 05:45.595
It's just... it's weird
to be dating a billionaire.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.902
[chuckles]

05:46.950 --> 05:49.771
Not a billionaire.

05:49.820 --> 05:51.993
$185 million.

05:54.610 --> 05:56.089
You going to see Ruth?

05:56.130 --> 05:57.392
Yeah.

05:57.440 --> 05:58.737
She wants to talk about Alicia.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.087
Yes.

06:00.140 --> 06:02.005
Tell her I handled it.

06:02.050 --> 06:03.608
I need your help, Ms. Paige.

06:03.660 --> 06:06.003
With the campaign?Yes, in a way.

06:06.060 --> 06:07.664
_ A|i_cia Flo_rrick has _
an investigator in her law firm.

06:07.710 --> 06:09.052
Jason Crouse?

06:09.100 --> 06:11.239
Are you worried
something untoward's going on

06:11.280 --> 06:12.793
between the two of them?

06:12.850 --> 06:14.101
How did you know?

06:14.150 --> 06:16.061
Well, Eli said
there wasn't.

06:16.110 --> 06:19.022
Yes, Eli has a way of
not wanting to face facts--

06:19.070 --> 06:21.026
at least not with Alicia.

06:21.070 --> 06:22.059
[sighs]

06:22.120 --> 06:23.724
Are they having an affair?

06:23.770 --> 06:25.112
I don't think so.

06:25.160 --> 06:26.206
But...

06:26.250 --> 06:29.856
Well, what can I do?

06:30.910 --> 06:32.866
[ringtone playing]

06:39.740 --> 06:41.082
Hello.

06:41.130 --> 06:43.007
PAIGE:
Hello. Is this Jason Crouse?

06:43.050 --> 06:44.438
It might be. Who's this?

06:44.490 --> 06:46.094
Courtney Paige, Mr. Crouse.

06:46.140 --> 06:49.610
I'm looking for an investigator,
and you come highly recommended.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.444
Well, that's good news.

06:51.490 --> 06:52.923
From who?

06:52.970 --> 06:54.699
Someone I'd rather not name.

06:54.760 --> 06:56.102
Are you available?

06:56.150 --> 06:57.276
That depends.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.106
How does $50,000 sound?

06:59.150 --> 07:01.141
For two months' work.

07:03.640 --> 07:04.937
[sighs]

07:04.980 --> 07:06.459
[indistinct chatter]

07:06.510 --> 07:07.898
CARY:
Good morning.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.640
How'd you find us?

07:13.690 --> 07:15.646
Where's the brief?

07:15.690 --> 07:17.248
DIRK: Don't you want
to know why we left?No.

07:17.300 --> 07:18.813
I want the brief.It's nothing personal.

07:18.870 --> 07:20.383
We like you.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.567
We just... don't want
to be like you.

07:25.180 --> 07:26.875
I don't give a damn.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.820
Give me back the brief.

07:28.880 --> 07:30.040
There is no brief.
We never started it.

07:32.190 --> 07:33.999
You erased the files.

07:34.060 --> 07:36.051
I could file a criminal
swt for spoliation.

07:36.100 --> 07:37.089
BRIAN:
Come on, Cary.

07:37.150 --> 07:38.401
You know
we're too smart for that.

07:38.450 --> 07:39.883
That's why you hired us, right?

07:39.930 --> 07:41.056
Brian made sure
we didn't look

07:41.110 --> 07:42.099
at anything
in Dipple's files.

07:42.150 --> 07:44.015
Pretty much put up
our Chinese wall.

07:44.070 --> 07:46.197
You avoided conflicting
yourselves out, so... so what?

07:46.240 --> 07:47.457
So you could start
your own firm?

07:47.510 --> 07:49.899
No. You told us
how hard that was.

07:49.940 --> 07:51.544
We're going to Canning.

07:51.600 --> 07:53.465
Canning represents
Dipple's opponent.

07:53.510 --> 07:56.297
He wants us.

07:56.340 --> 07:58.160
God...

07:58.210 --> 08:00.678
you arethe devil's spawn.

08:00.740 --> 08:02.640
ALICIA:
Be humble.

08:02.690 --> 08:04.476
Apologize for missing
the start of the trial.

08:04.520 --> 08:05.771
Mm-hmm.Tell the judge

08:05.830 --> 08:07.343
you recognize
the authority of this court,

08:07.390 --> 08:08.652
that this will never
happen again.

08:08.700 --> 08:10.656
Well, well.

08:10.700 --> 08:11.951
Who do we have here?

08:12.010 --> 08:13.261
Your Honor,
Dr. Portnow is present.

08:13.310 --> 08:14.652
I'd like to apologize,
Your Honor.

08:14.710 --> 08:15.961
I was in surgery...I can see that.

08:16.010 --> 08:18.137
The scr_ubs are
a really nice touch.

08:18.190 --> 08:19.179
That was not our choice,
Your Honor.

08:19.230 --> 08:20.447
He was arrested and...Okay, sir.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.183
Your bail has
been revoked.Your Honor!

08:22.240 --> 08:24.367
No, the three of you chose
theatrics over my valuable time.

08:27.020 --> 08:29.363
Far as I'm concerned,
you're a defendant,

08:29.420 --> 08:31.229
charged with conspiring
to kidnap,

08:31.290 --> 08:33.281
sedate and rape a woman.

08:33.330 --> 08:35.503
And to make sure
Dr. Portnow isn't too busy

08:35.550 --> 08:37.245
or distracted to make
his court dates,

08:37.290 --> 08:38.632
he'll be placed in the care of

08:38.690 --> 08:40.419
the Cook County
Department of Corrections.

08:40.470 --> 08:42.552
Just until we get
this rescheduled.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.079
Whenever that may be.Your Honor,

08:44.130 --> 08:45.427
I have patients lined up--
a newborn with

08:45.480 --> 08:46.424
hypoplastic left
heart syndrome.Sheriffs!

08:46.480 --> 08:47.822
[gavelbangs]

08:52.610 --> 08:55.431
Your Honor,
a moment of your time, please?

08:55.490 --> 08:58.050
No, Mrs. Florrick, another time.

08:58.100 --> 09:01.536
Actually, sir,
I think now is a good time.

09:01.580 --> 09:02.740
I'm sure you know
as well as I, ma'am,

09:02.800 --> 09:04.097
this is an ex parte
conversation.

09:04.150 --> 09:05.367
Yes, but I don't think

09:05.410 --> 09:07.014
you would want
the court to be aware

09:07.060 --> 09:08.789
that you are using personal bias

09:08.850 --> 09:10.545
to penalize my client.Really?

09:10.590 --> 09:11.807
What personal bias?

09:11.850 --> 09:13.454
Bias against me.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.195
Your client is accused
of conspiring to rape

09:15.250 --> 09:16.979
the mother of
one of his patients.

09:17.030 --> 09:19.544
Ifm not sure how our _
relationship figures into this.

09:21.430 --> 09:22.761
What?

09:25.910 --> 09:27.161
I'm waiting.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.693
You were bribed, sir.

09:35.220 --> 09:36.869
Excuse me?

09:36.920 --> 09:38.399
The FBI targeted you
for a bribe.

09:38.440 --> 09:39.395
Yeah.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.351
They targeted me.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.389
That means nothing.

09:42.450 --> 09:43.701
I didn't take it.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.183
Because Eli Gold warned you.

09:48.060 --> 09:49.493
Get out of here.

09:49.540 --> 09:52.191
Your Honor, all I'm asking for
is fairness.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.674
I said get out of here, ma'am.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.028
Now.

09:58.290 --> 09:59.188
I said now!

10:31.500 --> 10:34.185
It's the splash page
for BrutalMercy.com.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.662
It's an online meeting place

10:35.720 --> 10:37.199
for people
with dark sexual fetishes--

10:37.240 --> 10:40.152
rape, torture,
sexual humiliation.

10:40.200 --> 10:41.974
MATAN: And was the defendant
active on this site?

10:42.030 --> 10:43.679
RODRIGUEZ:
He was.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.595
Over the course of eight months,
he logged in 182 times.

10:45.640 --> 10:47.073
MATAN:
And was he just a lurker...

10:47.120 --> 10:48.985
I just want the jury
to see me touch you

10:49.030 --> 10:50.986
so you don't look
like a threat.

10:51.040 --> 10:52.814
Now nod.

10:52.860 --> 10:54.942
RODRIGUEZ:
...commented on other people's
posts, but then, on June 23,

10:55.000 --> 10:56.820
he posted a photo of a woman

10:56.870 --> 10:58.030
we I.D.'d as
Lucy Van Gaal.

10:58.090 --> 10:59.387
MATAN:
Can you read the message

10:59.440 --> 11:00.998
he attached to the first
of these photos?

11:01.050 --> 11:02.824
"Can't get this one
off my mind.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.179
Tasty target.
KSR anyone?"

11:05.220 --> 11:07.131
And do you know what
"KSR" means?
I do.

11:07.180 --> 11:10.798
It's used on the site
for "kidnap, sedate, rape."

11:10.840 --> 11:13.616
Did anyone respond
to Dr. Portnow?

11:13.670 --> 11:15.831
Yes, another user,
Ortolan246.

11:15.890 --> 11:17.710
He wrote he was
"up for the KSR,"

11:17.760 --> 11:18.920
and then they set
up a private chat.

11:18.980 --> 11:20.800
And how specific
were they?
Extremely.

11:20.850 --> 11:21.930
They worked out
how the defendant

11:21.980 --> 11:23.231
was going to kidnap
Ms. Van Gaal,

11:23.290 --> 11:25.019
what he would use
to sedate her,

11:25.070 --> 11:27.937
what the two of them wanted
to do to her sexually.

11:27.990 --> 11:29.639
Your Honor,
I'd like to enter 211

11:29.680 --> 11:31.022
of the defendant's posts
as evidence.

11:31.080 --> 11:33.719
Objection. The sheer volume
is prejudicial.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.168
They're directly relevant
to proving the first element

11:35.210 --> 11:37.075
of the conspiracy:
the defendant's

11:37.130 --> 11:39.075
agreement with Ortolan
to do something illegal.

11:39.130 --> 11:41.690
If you'd rather, Mrs. Florrick,
we can read into the record,

11:41.740 --> 11:43.640
and I'll rule on them
one by one.

11:43.700 --> 11:46.396
MATAN:
So, for a number of months,

11:46.440 --> 11:49.136
you tracked
the defendant's plan to kidnap,

11:49.180 --> 11:51.785
sedate and rape
Lucy Van Gaal.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.614
But how did you decide
when to arrest him?

11:53.660 --> 11:55.662
We waited until the night before
he was going to abduct her.

11:55.710 --> 11:57.610
He had just been online,
finalizing the plan

11:57.670 --> 11:59.570
with Ortolan.
Can you tell us
what they agreed to?

11:59.630 --> 12:00.790
Ortolan said he was

12:00.850 --> 12:02.715
gonna call in sick
to the bank he worked at

12:02.760 --> 12:05.012
in Tampa and then drive
overnight to Chicago.

12:05.070 --> 12:07.675
While the defendant
kidnapped Ms. Van Gaal,

12:07.720 --> 12:09.847
Ortolan was responsible
for arranging a place

12:09.900 --> 12:12.289
where they could take her
and rape her undisturbed.

12:12.340 --> 12:14.149
And did you find
any real-world evidence

12:14.210 --> 12:15.507
consistent with that plan?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.369
In the trunk of the
defendant's car--

12:17.430 --> 12:19.113
rubber tubing,
syringes, propofol,

12:19.170 --> 12:20.159
which matched exactly

12:20.210 --> 12:23.862
what he described
in his posts.

12:23.910 --> 12:27.084
There has to be
an ea5ier way.

12:27.130 --> 12:29.178
The easier way walked out
the door this morning.

12:29.220 --> 12:30.915
Oh, come on,
this is fun.

12:30.960 --> 12:32.689
First case I ever
worked on was a patent.

12:32.750 --> 12:34.308
For what,
the wheel?

12:34.360 --> 12:35.964
They went over to Canning.

12:36.010 --> 12:38.058
You're kidding.

12:38.100 --> 12:39.351
Did you get back
their work product?

12:39.410 --> 12:40.798
They sandbagged us.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.489
They never did a thing.

12:42.540 --> 12:44.269
We're dead in the water.
No.

12:44.320 --> 12:46.584
We have to pull this together.What, in three
and a half hours?

12:46.630 --> 12:48.018
How much time
do you think we need?

12:48.070 --> 12:49.628
DAVID: A week to find
new assoaates.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.898
Another week to figure out
what the hell this is.

12:51.940 --> 12:53.191
I need to come
clean with Carver.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.286
HOWARD:
I could call the judge.

12:55.330 --> 12:57.719
You know Nico Terzzi?
Yeah.

12:57.770 --> 13:00.728
Can ask him for some breathing
room on this filing deadline.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.169
And I'll go get us some help.

13:03.210 --> 13:04.518
ALICIA:
Detective,

13:04.560 --> 13:06.039
do you remember
how Dr. Portnow

13:06.080 --> 13:08.036
said he had
selected Ms. Van Gaal?

13:08.090 --> 13:11.605
Yes, he said she was a passenger
on a recent flight he'd piloted.

13:11.660 --> 13:13.082
Was that true?

13:13.140 --> 13:15.176
RODRIGUEZ:
What do you mean?

13:15.220 --> 13:17.222
ALICIA: Were Dr. Portnow and Ms.
Van Gaal on a flight together?

13:17.270 --> 13:18.658
I don't believe so.

13:18.710 --> 13:20.519
You don't believe so?
Didn't you check it?

13:20.580 --> 13:21.877
I did.

13:21.930 --> 13:24.831
So don't you know it
not to be true?

13:24.890 --> 13:26.278
I do.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.015
_ So it was all
just a fantasy, right?

13:28.060 --> 13:29.015
That part was.

13:29.060 --> 13:30.664
Well, what about his plan?

13:30.720 --> 13:33.154
You called the tubing, the
syringes and propofol evidence,

13:33.200 --> 13:35.714
but aren't those reasonable
things for a surgeon to have?

13:35.770 --> 13:37.761
I found it unusual he had
them in the trunk of his car.

13:37.810 --> 13:39.027
Even though Dr. Portnow

13:39.070 --> 13:42.028
explained how medical
device company reps

13:42.080 --> 13:44.071
often give him samples and
he just tosses them in his car?

13:44.120 --> 13:46.202
He did say that, yes.

13:46.260 --> 13:50.515
So Dr. Portnow created a fantasy
where he was a pilot,

13:50.560 --> 13:52.118
which he's not,

13:52.170 --> 13:54.126
and Lucy Van Gaal was
a passenger, which she wasn't.

13:54.180 --> 13:56.785
And he talked about using tools
that turned out to be

13:56.830 --> 13:58.343
leftover medical supplies...Objection, Judge.

13:58.400 --> 14:00.004
Detective Rodriguez is
supposed to be testifying,

14:00.050 --> 14:02.302
not Mrs. Florrick.
Sustained.

14:02.360 --> 14:06.057
Detective, Dr. Portnow wrote
some upsetting things online.

14:06.100 --> 14:09.752
But he never kidnapped
or sedated

14:09.800 --> 14:12.268
or raped anyone, did he?

14:12.320 --> 14:13.753
No, but that's because
we stopped him

14:13.800 --> 14:15.233
before he could.Thank you so much, Detective.

14:15.280 --> 14:16.360
We appreciate you testifying.

14:18.500 --> 14:19.808
How's it going?

14:19.850 --> 14:21.112
LUCCA:
Skeptical jury,

14:21.160 --> 14:22.934
skeevy client--
harder than it should be

14:22.990 --> 14:24.503
with someone who's not guilty.

14:24.550 --> 14:25.892
All right,
what can I do to help?

14:25.950 --> 14:27.110
ALICIA: Check out
the dark fetish Web site.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.683
_ Find out
if anyone on there

14:28.730 --> 14:29.901
has ever committed
an actual crime.

14:29.950 --> 14:31.167
Congratulations,
there's a lot

14:31.210 --> 14:32.939
of weird porn
in your future.

14:35.390 --> 14:37.119
I may have to raise my rate.

14:37.180 --> 14:39.819
I didn't realize
you were such a prude.

14:39.870 --> 14:42.088
I've been offered $200 an hour.

14:42.140 --> 14:43.789
Diane wants you
that bad?

14:43.830 --> 14:44.967
No.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.352
Courtney Paige.

14:46.400 --> 14:49.745
She wants to hire you?

14:49.800 --> 14:51.313
Someplace out of town.

14:51.360 --> 14:53.794
San Jose.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.319
[sighs]

14:55.370 --> 14:57.588
Yep. That's Eli's doing.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.279
He's worried about us.

14:59.330 --> 15:01.025
The offer was for two months.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.195
I can't beat $200.

15:05.250 --> 15:08.287
I know.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.468
We want to
offer you the job.

15:12.520 --> 15:14.420
You do?

15:14.470 --> 15:16.426
Um, look, we made
a mistake not hiring you

15:16.480 --> 15:18.994
the first time around,
but, uh,

15:19.040 --> 15:21.088
I thought we worked
well together on Chumhum.

15:21.130 --> 15:22.734
And that's why
you want me back?

15:22.790 --> 15:24.599
Because we worked
well together?

15:24.660 --> 15:26.434
Yes, of course.

15:27.490 --> 15:29.264
[indistinct shouting]

15:30.970 --> 15:32.835
[clears throat]

15:32.880 --> 15:34.836
I want the same salary the
other associates were getting,

15:34.890 --> 15:36.926
and 250 protected
pro bono hours.

15:40.020 --> 15:42.671
LUCY:
Dr. Portnow was my hero.

15:42.720 --> 15:44.108
Bella's had _
three open heart surgeries,

15:44.160 --> 15:46.458
and Dr. Portnow was there
every step of the way.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.193
So when did you first
become aware of your role

15:48.250 --> 15:50.286
in the defendant's
rape fantaSIes?

15:50.340 --> 15:53.503
After he was arrested,
Detective Rodriguez

15:53.560 --> 15:56.245
showed me the things
he posted on that Web site.

15:56.300 --> 15:58.200
Could you please
read this?

15:58.260 --> 16:00.421
Objection. Your Honor, these
posts are already in evidence.

16:00.480 --> 16:02.380
MATAN: Ms. Van Gaal's
interpretation of the posts

16:02.430 --> 16:04.125
is necessary to establish
their relationship.

16:04.180 --> 16:05.169
He's reaching.

16:05.220 --> 16:07.085
I disagree. Overruled.

16:09.490 --> 16:10.741
"We're ready.

16:10.790 --> 16:12.223
"I know where that bitch lives,

16:12.270 --> 16:14.135
"and she worships me,
so this won't be hard.

16:14.190 --> 16:16.408
"I just need
to get her alone.

16:16.450 --> 16:19.089
"Once I stick her
with the sedative,

16:19.150 --> 16:20.970
_"it's seconds
till she twilights,

16:21.020 --> 16:24.319
then I'll take
her limp body..."

16:24.370 --> 16:26.326
I can't read this.

16:26.370 --> 16:29.157
MATAN: That post is from
October 23.

16:29.200 --> 16:32.988
The next day, October 24,
did the defendant call you?

16:33.030 --> 16:35.157
He said he was
checking up on Bella.

16:35.210 --> 16:36.427
MATAN: But when you told him
you were home alone,

16:36.470 --> 16:37.687
that Bella was
out at a play date,

16:37.730 --> 16:39.778
did he ask if he could
come by anyway?

16:39.820 --> 16:42.163
He said he'd be in
the neighborhood.

16:42.210 --> 16:43.689
And if he hadn't
been arrested

16:43.740 --> 16:46.038
and had stopped by,

16:46.090 --> 16:48.650
you wouldn't have hesitated
to let him in, would you?

16:52.620 --> 16:55.088
LUCCA: In all the times
you were with Dr. Portnow,

16:55.140 --> 16:58.223
did he ever say or do
anything inappropriate?

16:58.270 --> 17:00.056
No, never.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.148
You always found him
to be a good physician

17:02.190 --> 17:03.748
and a caring person?

17:03.800 --> 17:05.358
I thought so, but...

17:05.410 --> 17:07.662
Lucy, October 24
wasn't the first time

17:07.720 --> 17:09.540
Dr. Portnow called to
check up on Bella, was it?

17:09.590 --> 17:10.545
No.

17:10.590 --> 17:12.364
Do you remember his calls to you

17:12.420 --> 17:14.376
on June 13, July 11

17:14.420 --> 17:16.320
and July 25?Not specifically,

17:16.380 --> 17:18.985
but Bella had a surgery
during the summer.

17:19.030 --> 17:20.076
Are you aware that Dr. Portnow

17:20.120 --> 17:21.724
posted on
the fetish Web site

17:21.770 --> 17:23.818
that he went to your house
on those days?

17:23.860 --> 17:25.737
No.

17:25.780 --> 17:27.293
So he may have had
fantasies about you,

17:27.350 --> 17:28.556
but he never acted
on any of them,

17:28.610 --> 17:30.339
did he?

17:34.350 --> 17:36.784
I guess not.

17:36.830 --> 17:39.390
I don't know if I
want to win this one.

17:39.440 --> 17:40.839
Why, 'cause you think
he did it?

17:40.880 --> 17:42.928
I mean, intended to do it?

17:42.970 --> 17:44.403
I don't know.

17:44.450 --> 17:47.317
But when you fantasize
about something that much,

17:47.370 --> 17:49.531
I don't think it
makes a difference.

17:49.590 --> 17:52.536
Yet there are 50 children
alive today because of him.

17:52.590 --> 17:56.412
Yeah, and if we lose,
there will be hundreds more

17:56.460 --> 17:59.065
who won't _live _
because he'll be in prison.

17:59.120 --> 18:01.418
It's odd.

18:01.470 --> 18:04.428
That someone can be so good,

18:04.470 --> 18:06.813
yet think things so bad.

18:06.860 --> 18:08.589
It's people.

18:08.650 --> 18:10.163
They're all scum.

18:12.130 --> 18:13.210
Damaged much?

18:13.260 --> 18:15.512
No, observant.

18:15.570 --> 18:17.083
Don't expect
anything of anybody

18:17.130 --> 18:18.392
and you'll never be
disappointed.

18:18.440 --> 18:20.214
That's a sad way to live.

18:20.270 --> 18:21.692
It doesn't
have to be.

18:21.750 --> 18:25.265
You and I are just sitting here,
having a pleasant drink.

18:25.320 --> 18:27.276
But I don't expect
anything of you,

18:27.320 --> 18:28.878
and you don't expect
anything of me.

18:28.930 --> 18:30.318
Still, I'm not gonna kill you.

18:32.320 --> 18:33.844
Not yet, anyway.

18:33.890 --> 18:35.664
Bourbon neat, please.

18:35.720 --> 18:37.142
Good time on
the fetish site?

18:37.200 --> 18:39.418
Ha-ha. Talked to a buddy
in cybercrimes,

18:39.460 --> 18:41.280
said they've never had
a case of someone

18:41.330 --> 18:44.151
on the Brutal Mercy site
actually committing a crime.

18:44.210 --> 18:45.768
Good. That helps.

18:45.820 --> 18:46.946
But?

18:46.990 --> 18:49.641
But he is familiar with the case

18:49.690 --> 18:53.251
'cause CPD is working it
alongside the S.A.'s office.

18:53.300 --> 18:55.256
They have tracked down

18:55.300 --> 18:56.904
Ortolan246.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.303
The banker who shared
Portnow's fantasy.

18:59.350 --> 19:01.602
Yeah, actually,
he's a registered sex offender

19:01.660 --> 19:04.390
in Milwaukee, and he is
testifying for the prosecution.

19:04.440 --> 19:07.045
[sighs] Damn.

19:09.140 --> 19:10.835
JASON: Alicia, can I talk
to you for a second?

19:10.880 --> 19:11.869
Sure.

19:16.060 --> 19:18.528
Listen, I don't want to
leave you in the lurch,

19:18.590 --> 19:20.364
but I'm on a plane tomorrow.

19:20.420 --> 19:25.414
I can delay a week if you
want me to finish this out.

19:25.460 --> 19:27.508
No, you shouldn't.

19:27.550 --> 19:29.893
Okay.

19:29.950 --> 19:31.508
Good luck.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.336
How long will you be gone?

19:34.390 --> 19:36.460
Couple months.

19:36.520 --> 19:41.435
I... I understand if I don't
have a job when I come back.

19:41.480 --> 19:42.913
Will you call me?

19:43.960 --> 19:47.259
Um... when you get back.

19:48.570 --> 19:50.356
Sure.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.392
You ever spent any time
in Northern California?

19:53.450 --> 19:56.055
Enough.

19:56.100 --> 19:59.445
Too much fleece,
too many ironic beards.

19:59.500 --> 20:01.491
[laughs]

20:05.550 --> 20:06.585
Good-bye.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.108
Yeah.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.412
Good-bye, Alicia.

20:14.510 --> 20:18.253
[door opens, closes]

20:34.790 --> 20:36.792
[footsteps]

20:44.110 --> 20:46.066
Oh, Monica,
there you are.

20:46.110 --> 20:47.543
Appendix to the Federal Rules.

20:47.590 --> 20:49.148
I flagged Form 18.

20:49.200 --> 20:50.588
I still need the
conforming examples...

20:50.640 --> 20:52.198
Not until you get me
on the phone

20:52.250 --> 20:53.638
with the egghead
from Chicago Polytech.

20:53.680 --> 20:55.762
I tracked down
Professor Kennedy's secretary.

20:55.810 --> 20:57.459
She is waking him.

20:57.510 --> 20:58.556
Monica, is Form 18...?

20:58.600 --> 20:59.555
It's a template

20:59.600 --> 21:00.680
for simplified pleading.

21:00.730 --> 21:02.812
We don't need
more than that.

21:05.610 --> 21:07.510
Hey.

21:07.570 --> 21:09.174
If you want to grab
a quick nap...

21:09.220 --> 21:10.300
When this is over.

21:10.350 --> 21:12.659
[Howard grunting]

21:12.700 --> 21:15.487
I... didn't want to eat this.

21:21.010 --> 21:23.478
We're not gonna make
this filing deadline, are we?

21:23.540 --> 21:25.974
No.

21:26.020 --> 21:27.578
Where are you going?

21:27.630 --> 21:29.450
We need more bodies.

21:29.500 --> 21:32.105
Manny Hofstadter, aka

21:32.160 --> 21:34.458
Ortolan246.

21:34.510 --> 21:36.319
Are you a convicted sex
offender, Mr. Hofstadter?

21:36.380 --> 21:38.416
You could say that.

21:38.470 --> 21:39.676
And what is your occupation?

21:39.730 --> 21:41.334
Trucker, long-haul.

21:41.380 --> 21:42.859
That's an isolating life,
isn't it?

21:42.910 --> 21:44.855
I guess you could
also say that.

21:44.910 --> 21:46.775
So when you're driving
and you stop for the night,

21:46.820 --> 21:48.344
what do you do?

21:48.390 --> 21:50.085
Ah, hang out in the back
of my rig, read some.

21:50.130 --> 21:51.609
Mostly go online.

21:51.650 --> 21:52.912
Do you visit a lot
of fetish sites?

21:52.960 --> 21:54.473
Used to.

21:54.530 --> 21:56.600
Then I really got into
Brutal Mercy.

21:56.660 --> 21:58.309
Which is where you connected
with the defendant.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.009
HOFSTADTER:
Yeah, TheAlgea.

22:00.050 --> 22:01.779
Yeah, that's his screen name.

22:01.840 --> 22:05.355
The Greek spirits
of pain and suffering.

22:05.410 --> 22:07.753
[chuckles]
I liked that.

22:07.800 --> 22:10.109
MATAN: You also liked his plan
to "KSR" Lucy Van Gaal.

22:10.150 --> 22:13.404
I did. I still do.

22:13.460 --> 22:15.360
It wasn't just
a fantasy for you?

22:15.420 --> 22:17.411
I was all set to
go through with it.

22:17.460 --> 22:19.587
So was TheAlgea.Objection!
Speculation!

22:19.640 --> 22:20.538
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
One at a time.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.989
Speculation,
Your Honor.

22:23.030 --> 22:25.419
SCHAKOWSKY: Sustained. The jury
will disregard the comment about

22:25.470 --> 22:27.426
what the defendant did
or did not intend to do.

22:27.470 --> 22:28.459
_ MATAN: _ _
Does it change your opinion

22:28.520 --> 22:30.385
to know TheAlgea wasn't a pilot?

22:30.430 --> 22:33.422
Nah, we all use
fake online personas.

22:33.480 --> 22:35.516
Feeds the fantasy.

22:35.570 --> 22:37.561
MATAN:
So what made you think this time
was more than just fantasy?

22:37.610 --> 22:40.784
I could tell TheAlgea
really knew Lucy,

22:40.830 --> 22:45.392
and the plan he had, uh,
it wasn't just made-up kink.

22:45.450 --> 22:46.701
It was too real.

22:46.750 --> 22:48.706
And I wanted in.

22:48.750 --> 22:50.445
[chuckles]

22:50.490 --> 22:52.185
Your sex offender status,

22:52.240 --> 22:56.404
is that the result of any
violent or nonconsensual crime?

22:56.460 --> 22:59.190
Nah, I got popped a few times
with lot lizards.

22:59.240 --> 23:01.674
You s_olicited
prostitutes?

23:01.720 --> 23:03.028
Like he said,

23:03.070 --> 23:04.674
road's a lonely place.

23:04.730 --> 23:07.119
And in exchange for
your testimony today,

23:07.160 --> 23:10.948
your most recent solicitation
charge was dropped, wasn't it?

23:10.990 --> 23:13.515
Oh, yeah.

23:13.560 --> 23:15.812
Before today, before you
walked into this room,

23:15.870 --> 23:18.338
you'd never even seen
Dr. Portnow before, had you?

23:18.390 --> 23:20.699
HOFSTADTER: Never.LUCCA: Did you have
a phone number for him?

23:20.740 --> 23:23.698
Or an e-mail?He didn't give them to me.

23:23.750 --> 23:27.265
So even though you had no way
of connecting in the real world,

23:27.310 --> 23:29.744
you still thought you two were
going through with this plan?

23:29.790 --> 23:31.348
We were gonna use the site.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.537
He was supposed to put up a post

23:33.580 --> 23:36.629
that had the word "hooked" in it
when he grabbed up Lucy.

23:36.670 --> 23:38.922
But did you actually
arrange a place?

23:38.980 --> 23:40.709
Yeah.

23:40.760 --> 23:42.364
That's odd.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.069
Your company
driving records show

23:44.110 --> 23:45.509
you were out of state
this whole time.

23:45.550 --> 23:46.539
Objection, Your Honor.

23:46.590 --> 23:47.545
Not in evidence.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.113
That's right.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.946
I think Lucca wants
to put it into eVIdence.

23:50.990 --> 23:53.902
LUCCA: Yes, Your Honor.
Here's his cargo manifest.

23:53.950 --> 23:56.464
So how were
you planning

23:56.520 --> 23:59.956
to participate all the way
from Santa Fe, New Mexico;

24:00.000 --> 24:02.992
Bakersfield, California;
and Santa Cruz?

24:03.050 --> 24:04.563
HOFSTADTER:
I could get back.
Really?

24:04.610 --> 24:06.828
2,965 miles,

24:06.880 --> 24:08.211
a drive that would take
four days.

24:08.270 --> 24:09.225
If he'd have written me,

24:09.270 --> 24:11.261
I would've driven back.

24:11.310 --> 24:13.528
Yes, and your cargo of
fresh fruit and vegetables--

24:13.580 --> 24:15.616
I guess you'd just
drop those beside the road.

24:17.540 --> 24:20.054
Yeah, if he had written me.

24:22.930 --> 24:24.670
All right.

24:24.720 --> 24:25.675
Sure.

24:25.720 --> 24:26.675
Stick with that.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.675
MATAN:
Objection.

24:27.720 --> 24:28.891
Sustained.

24:32.470 --> 24:33.630
Jason.

24:33.680 --> 24:35.500
How are you?

24:35.560 --> 24:36.811
Good. Heading out.

24:36.860 --> 24:38.339
Northern California,
here I come.

24:38.380 --> 24:40.428
You're relocating?

24:40.470 --> 24:42.904
[chuckles]
For a while.

24:42.950 --> 24:45.339
Hey, if you see Alicia,

24:45.390 --> 24:47.346
tell her I left something
for her.

24:47.390 --> 24:49.563
Sure. Where?

24:49.610 --> 24:52.170
She'll know.

25:01.580 --> 25:04.367
[cell phone ringing]

25:04.410 --> 25:05.365
Eli.

25:05.410 --> 25:06.581
PAIGE:
Hi.

25:06.630 --> 25:07.585
Oh, hey, Courtney.

25:07.630 --> 25:08.585
What's up?

25:08.630 --> 25:10.586
What are you doing?

25:10.630 --> 25:13.326
Nothing, nothing.

25:13.380 --> 25:14.540
Just waiting for your call.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.204
Do you have time
to see me tonight?

25:16.250 --> 25:17.592
Well, I didn't until you asked.

25:17.640 --> 25:18.891
How does 8:15 sound?

25:18.950 --> 25:20.554
That's very specific.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.558
Well, I'm a specific
kind of girl.

25:23.600 --> 25:25.386
Okay, I'll see you at 8:16.

25:25.430 --> 25:27.603
I'm demonstrating
my independence by being late.

25:27.650 --> 25:28.605
See you then.

25:28.650 --> 25:29.605
Bye.

25:29.650 --> 25:31.174
Eli.

25:31.220 --> 25:32.949
Alicia, hi.
How are you?

25:33.000 --> 25:34.001
What do you need?

25:34.050 --> 25:36.177
I've come to talk to you

25:36.230 --> 25:37.561
about something
slightly sensitive.

25:37.620 --> 25:39.963
Jackie and Howard.

25:48.850 --> 25:50.624
Is everything all right?

25:50.670 --> 25:52.626
What?

25:52.680 --> 25:54.159
Yeah, what do you need?

25:54.200 --> 25:55.974
Peter thinks
she should have a prenup.

25:56.030 --> 25:57.509
VVho?

25:57.550 --> 25:59.336
Jackie... and Howard.

25:59.380 --> 26:02.508
Eli, I don't give a single damn.

26:02.560 --> 26:04.983
Why are you
in my life, Eli?

26:05.040 --> 26:07.167
[scoffs]
Why am I...?

26:07.210 --> 26:08.518
Yes, why are you telling
my investigator

26:08.560 --> 26:09.640
to go move to Silicon Valley?

26:09.690 --> 26:11.567
Why are...?I didn't.

26:11.610 --> 26:13.862
Why are you letting
your paranoia rule my business?

26:13.920 --> 26:15.080
Alicia, wait.No, seriously.

26:15.130 --> 26:16.859
Eli, I have been very fluid

26:16.920 --> 26:20.219
with the lines between your
needs and mine, but we're done.

26:20.270 --> 26:22.704
Alicia, I haven't
done anything.
He's going
to work for Courtney Paige.

26:22.750 --> 26:25.446
I can't find a good investigator
in the same price range,

26:25.490 --> 26:27.924
and I probably won't be able
to afford him when he gets back.

26:27.970 --> 26:30.234
And what business
is it of yours

26:30.280 --> 26:32.589
what I'm doing
with my private |ife?Alicia...

26:32.630 --> 26:34.973
My life is mylife,
and I want you

26:35.020 --> 26:36.499
to back the hell up!

26:36.550 --> 26:39.769
I wasn't sleeping with Jason.

26:39.810 --> 26:42.153
But even if I was,
that's my business.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.940
It wasn't me.

26:43.990 --> 26:46.982
I don't know how he came
to Courtney's attention, but...

26:47.040 --> 26:49.076
Actually, I do know how he came
to Courtney's attention.

26:49.120 --> 26:50.075
Eli, leave.

26:50.130 --> 26:51.336
It was Ruth, not me.

26:51.390 --> 26:53.073
Leave, Eli. I have a client.

26:53.130 --> 26:54.347
She's just
with someone right now.

26:54.390 --> 26:55.425
Thank you so much for...

26:55.480 --> 26:56.822
Alicia, I swear.

26:56.870 --> 26:58.349
I don't care.

26:58.390 --> 26:59.652
Now, I have work to do.

26:59.700 --> 27:01.691
Work that will be twice as hard

27:01.750 --> 27:03.559
because I don't have
an investigator.

27:03.620 --> 27:05.394
Now leave.

27:08.880 --> 27:10.666
[sighs]

27:10.710 --> 27:12.189
So is it final?

27:12.230 --> 27:14.278
Is what final?

27:14.320 --> 27:16.106
Did you sign the
contracts with Canning?

27:16.150 --> 27:18.675
Not yet. Brian's pushing
to get us a ten percent bonus

27:18.720 --> 27:19.971
if we crack 2,500 hours.

27:20.020 --> 27:21.897
It's all over
but the shouting.

27:21.940 --> 27:25.671
Well, if it's not overover,
then I have a pitch.

27:25.730 --> 27:27.675
We're willing to offer you
20% billables bonus

27:27.730 --> 27:28.890
if you come back.

27:28.950 --> 27:30.201
You serious?

27:30.250 --> 27:31.945
Yes.

27:31.990 --> 27:32.945
You're desperate.

27:32.990 --> 27:34.469
Maybe.

27:34.520 --> 27:36.476
But I'm willing to beat

27:36.520 --> 27:38.249
whatever Canning is
offering you salary-wise.

27:38.300 --> 27:40.689
It's not just about the
money, Cary. We told you.

27:40.740 --> 27:42.696
It's the lack of upward
mobility, the culture.

27:42.740 --> 27:44.469
CARY: And if we
change that.You tried already.

27:44.530 --> 27:46.259
Didn't work.CARY: 'Cause I didn't
have the leverage.

27:46.310 --> 27:48.039
Now, with the threat
of Dipple walking, I do.

27:48.100 --> 27:49.658
Can't just have
idle promises.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.052
Instead of eight years
to partner,

27:51.100 --> 27:52.089
we'll guarantee you five.

27:53.840 --> 27:55.831
Full equity.

27:55.890 --> 27:57.016
And you pick your cases,

27:57.060 --> 27:59.756
no mandatory rotations.

28:01.940 --> 28:03.498
We need it in writing.

28:03.550 --> 28:05.495
Yes, but you have to commit
right now and get back

28:05.550 --> 28:07.279
to work immediately;
the only way this works

28:07.330 --> 28:09.286
is we get on the
Dipple case right now.

28:09.330 --> 28:10.672
How do we know you're
serious about this?

28:13.600 --> 28:16.592
Got $80,000 in signing bonuses
to back it up.

28:21.430 --> 28:24.217
LUCCA: Thank you for
testifying for your husband.

28:24.260 --> 28:26.990
I know how difficult
this must be, having to confront

28:27.050 --> 28:28.870
all of this.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.524
PATRICIA:
Things are only difficult
if you don't understand them.

28:30.570 --> 28:32.435
You understand your husband?

28:32.490 --> 28:34.219
He's highly compartmentalized.

28:34.270 --> 28:36.226
Most extraordinarily successful
people are.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.580
That's true.

28:40.630 --> 28:43.190
My husband's online activities
provide a safe space

28:43.240 --> 28:46.414
where he can explore and exhaust
his darker thoughts

28:46.460 --> 28:48.849
so they don't spill over
into the rest of his life.

28:48.900 --> 28:50.026
They're a
necessary release.

28:51.680 --> 28:53.409
I know you're a therapist...

28:53.470 --> 28:55.199
I'm a clinical psychiatrist.

28:55.250 --> 28:56.467
Right.

28:56.510 --> 28:58.375
But we're calling you as a wife.

28:58.430 --> 29:01.775
We want you to explain
why you trust your husband,

29:01.820 --> 29:03.037
why the jury should, too.

29:03.080 --> 29:04.957
Because he's superlative
at what he does.

29:05.000 --> 29:07.696
He supports my
professional goals

29:07.740 --> 29:10.049
and respects my
personal boundaries,

29:10.090 --> 29:12.138
and I extend the same
courtesies to him.

29:12.180 --> 29:13.135
Okay.

29:13.180 --> 29:15.262
But...

29:15.310 --> 29:17.266
we're worried, to a jury,

29:17.320 --> 29:19.743
this analysis could
come off a bit...

29:19.800 --> 29:21.665
Cold.

29:21.710 --> 29:23.314
You want me to be less clinical?

29:23.370 --> 29:26.498
How you would be at home
with your husband.

29:27.590 --> 29:30.104
This is how I am
with my husband.

29:32.810 --> 29:34.766
She's a disaster.

29:34.810 --> 29:36.289
What do we do?

29:36.330 --> 29:39.288
We need someone_
to explain these fanta5ies.

29:39.340 --> 29:41.331
Put the good doctor
on the stand?

29:46.740 --> 29:48.037
Okay, that was, uh...Amazing.

29:48.090 --> 29:51.048
[both chuckle]

29:51.090 --> 29:53.081
[cell phone ringing]

29:57.230 --> 29:58.174
Really?

29:58.230 --> 29:59.788
I turned off mine.

29:59.840 --> 30:00.784
Yeah.

30:00.840 --> 30:02.569
Okay, 20 minutes.

30:02.620 --> 30:06.181
We should get room service.

30:06.230 --> 30:07.049
You should.

30:07.100 --> 30:08.055
You have to go back to work?

30:08.110 --> 30:10.578
[sighs]
Yeah.

30:10.630 --> 30:12.848
You haven't got another hour?

30:12.890 --> 30:14.892
No.

30:26.690 --> 30:28.078
That was fun.

30:28.130 --> 30:31.384
Yeah, it... was.

30:31.430 --> 30:34.866
Wh... What are
we referring to?

30:34.920 --> 30:36.694
Tonight?

30:36.740 --> 30:37.866
[scoffs]

30:37.920 --> 30:39.649
I have to get back home.

30:39.700 --> 30:42.168
To the Bay Area?

30:42.230 --> 30:43.618
Yeah.

30:43.660 --> 30:46.094
When will you be back?

30:46.140 --> 30:47.869
In a while.

30:47.930 --> 30:48.919
What's a while?

30:50.060 --> 30:51.846
A year?

30:54.280 --> 30:56.271
Oh.

30:58.290 --> 31:00.064
So that's it.

31:00.110 --> 31:03.159
What do you mean?

31:03.200 --> 31:04.679
This.

31:04.730 --> 31:06.209
Between us.

31:06.250 --> 31:08.855
Oh... Eli.

31:08.910 --> 31:11.868
No, no, no, no, no.

31:11.910 --> 31:13.866
I know that voice.

31:16.390 --> 31:19.655
I've used that voice.

31:19.700 --> 31:20.860
This was fun.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.171
Yeah.

31:22.220 --> 31:24.871
It was fun.

31:24.920 --> 31:26.353
Like a carnival ride.

31:26.400 --> 31:28.129
[scoffs]

31:28.190 --> 31:29.225
I like you.

31:29.270 --> 31:31.272
And I like you.

31:35.280 --> 31:38.192
So Ruth got you to
buy off Jason Crouse?

31:38.240 --> 31:40.674
What?

31:40.720 --> 31:43.678
Alicia's investigator.

31:43.720 --> 31:46.154
Well, yeah.

31:46.200 --> 31:48.464
He's coming out to work
for a little while.

31:48.510 --> 31:51.502
Isn't that
what you wanted, too?

32:14.360 --> 32:17.011
Look, I'm in the heat
of a political campaign,

32:17.060 --> 32:19.847
and normally
all I'd be thinking about

32:19.890 --> 32:21.323
is tracking polls
and spot media,

32:21.370 --> 32:24.237
but right now I don't give
a damn about any of it.

32:26.460 --> 32:29.247
I don't know what this is,
but I like it.

32:31.250 --> 32:33.150
I think you're perfect.

32:33.210 --> 32:35.428
For me.

32:35.470 --> 32:37.426
So please don't go.

32:37.470 --> 32:42.214
Or go... or go, but come back.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.478
Soon.

32:44.520 --> 32:46.431
Eli.

32:46.480 --> 32:50.393
The way you feel
about campaigns,

32:50.440 --> 32:52.396
that's the way I feel
about my business.

32:52.440 --> 32:55.398
And right now,

32:55.450 --> 32:57.918
that's my focus,
business.

32:57.970 --> 33:00.222
You understand that, right?

33:02.280 --> 33:05.841
I loved every moment
of our being together.

33:08.020 --> 33:10.841
Know that.

33:40.400 --> 33:43.016
ALICIA: Those posts on Brutal
Mercy-- did you write them?

33:43.060 --> 33:44.140
Every word.

33:44.190 --> 33:45.441
Why?

33:45.500 --> 33:47.183
I've asked myself
that a lot,

33:47.240 --> 33:50.107
and the simple
answer is...

33:50.150 --> 33:51.970
they made me
feel good.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.236
Good?

33:53.290 --> 33:54.325
How?

33:54.380 --> 33:56.450
Not like a good person,
believe me,

33:56.510 --> 34:00.025
but, uh... excited,

34:00.080 --> 34:01.684
and, other times...

34:01.730 --> 34:03.425
relaxed.

34:03.470 --> 34:05.518
Oh, it's hard to say this
out loud.

34:05.560 --> 34:07.812
But it wasn't hard
to share these thoughts

34:07.870 --> 34:09.826
with Ortolan246?
No.

34:09.870 --> 34:11.087
I didn't know who he was.

34:11.130 --> 34:12.438
Or where he was.

34:12.480 --> 34:14.391
Well, then, why make plans

34:14.440 --> 34:16.089
with him?

34:16.140 --> 34:17.437
They weren't real plans.

34:17.490 --> 34:20.266
But they were so... specific.

34:20.310 --> 34:22.870
That made them
seem more real.

34:22.930 --> 34:26.616
I know how that sounds,
but I needed the release.

34:26.670 --> 34:30.492
The stress of what I do,
the stakes of my job,

34:30.540 --> 34:31.711
can be unbearable.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.671
But I can't
just walk away.

34:33.720 --> 34:35.153
Too many people

34:35.200 --> 34:36.497
depend on me.

34:36.550 --> 34:37.767
And the site--

34:37.810 --> 34:40.449
it became a way for me
to decompress.

34:40.510 --> 34:43.980
And I knew it was okay
because Lucy was safe.

34:44.030 --> 34:45.759
I knew I couldn't hurt her.

34:45.820 --> 34:48.380
That's not who I am.

34:48.430 --> 34:49.465
ALICIA:
Your Honor,

34:49.520 --> 34:51.556
we ask that you lay out not just

34:51.610 --> 34:53.384
the statutory elements
of conspiracy,

34:53.430 --> 34:54.909
but that you give examples
from specific cases...

34:54.960 --> 34:56.518
This is a smoke screen,
Your Honor.

34:56.570 --> 34:57.787
The_defense wants to confuse
the jury With a lot of case law.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.309
LUCCA: It's the jury
instructions, Your Honor.

34:59.350 --> 35:01.784
I'm not sure where else
you instruct the jury.

35:01.830 --> 35:03.138
MATAN: They have
their instructions.

35:03.180 --> 35:04.442
The Illinois Pattern
Jury Instructions.

35:04.490 --> 35:06.219
It's a simple matter of intent.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.056
What did Dr. Portnow
intend to do?

35:08.100 --> 35:09.749
No, what constitutes
a fantasy?

35:09.800 --> 35:11.529
If we can be convicted
for our fantaSIes,

35:11.580 --> 35:13.571
we're_ at the start
of a slippery slope.

35:13.630 --> 35:15.018
That's ridiculous.

35:15.060 --> 35:16.800
Intent is almost always
an issue in criminal cases.

35:16.850 --> 35:18.454
Whether you intend to kill

35:18.500 --> 35:20.149
is the difference between
murder and manslaughter.

35:20.200 --> 35:21.451
Thoughts matter.But to be criminal,

35:21.510 --> 35:22.989
thoughts have to be
coupled with actions,

35:23.030 --> 35:24.418
and the jury needs
to be clear on that.

35:24.470 --> 35:26.415
Okay. I've decided.

35:26.470 --> 35:27.983
The jury will be instructed
on all the statutory elements

35:28.030 --> 35:29.429
of conspiracy.Your Honor...

35:29.470 --> 35:31.597
No. The jury
needs it.

35:31.650 --> 35:34.073
And I will hear on what
legal precedents to mention.

35:34.130 --> 35:35.643
[elevator bell dings]

35:35.690 --> 35:38.386
It's weird to be
back here so soon.

35:38.440 --> 35:41.079
I'm sure it is,
but we don't have a lot of time.

35:41.130 --> 35:42.392
So what do you
need from us?

35:42.440 --> 35:44.044
Our strategy on the Dipple claim

35:44.090 --> 35:45.819
is to prove infringement
of core technique

35:45.880 --> 35:47.484
and block any
novel process argument.

35:51.490 --> 35:53.401
What?

35:53.450 --> 35:55.441
Actually, come to think of it,
we don't want your help.

35:55.500 --> 35:56.444
You're all fired.

35:56.500 --> 35:57.660
Excuse me?

35:57.720 --> 35:58.926
Yes. Diane, what do you
think about that?

35:58.980 --> 36:00.800
You're right.
I don't think we need them.

36:00.850 --> 36:01.930
What was that about?

36:01.980 --> 36:03.459
You just brought us here
to embarrass us?

36:03.500 --> 36:04.842
No, you just heard about
our side of the case.

36:04.900 --> 36:06.891
Now you're conflicted
out of working for Canning

36:06.940 --> 36:08.191
on his side.You can't do that.

36:08.250 --> 36:09.114
DIANE:
We just did.

36:09.160 --> 36:10.946
Thank you for your service.

36:10.990 --> 36:12.070
You can go now.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.554
And the signing bonuses?They're real.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.591
But I don't think
it'll look too good for you

36:16.650 --> 36:19.073
when I spread the word of
how easy it was to blow you

36:19.130 --> 36:21.166
out of a multimillion-dollar
claim for 80 grand.

36:21.220 --> 36:22.608
Jobs may be hard to come by.

36:22.650 --> 36:23.958
Go to hell.

36:24.000 --> 36:25.695
Oh, yes. Thank you.

36:25.740 --> 36:28.208
Not that I needed it, but you
just gave me cause to fire you.

36:28.270 --> 36:29.259
Gentlemen.

36:31.970 --> 36:33.187
Buh-bye.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.360
God, that was fun.

36:43.410 --> 36:44.968
[sighs]

36:55.900 --> 36:58.039
They were out
less than 15 minutes.

36:58.080 --> 37:00.071
Is that a good
or bad thing?

37:00.130 --> 37:02.291
It means the jury
was swayed powerfully,

37:02.350 --> 37:05.865
but I have no idea if it was
by the judge's instructions.

37:07.310 --> 37:09.266
Madam foreperson,
do we have a verdict?

37:09.310 --> 37:12.268
We do, Your Honor.

37:12.310 --> 37:14.483
In the matter of
People vs. Portnow,

37:14.530 --> 37:17.135
on the charge of conspiracy
to commit kidnapping...

37:19.190 --> 37:21.317
...we find the defendant

37:21.360 --> 37:23.180
guilty.

37:23.240 --> 37:24.969
[gallery cheering]

37:32.770 --> 37:34.988
...we find the defendant guilty.

37:35.030 --> 37:38.682
[gallery cheering]

37:38.730 --> 37:40.857
How can I be going to jail
for something that I didn't do,

37:40.910 --> 37:42.298
_ that was...
it was never gonna happen?

37:42.340 --> 37:44.467
We'll appeal.That could take years.

37:44.520 --> 37:46.294
MATAN: Your Honor, we'd like to
calendar a sentencing hearing.

37:46.350 --> 37:47.772
And, prior to sentencing,

37:47.830 --> 37:49.639
we ask that Dr. Portnow continue
to be held without bail.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.474
You're jumping
the gun, Matan.

37:51.530 --> 37:54.306
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the point where

37:54.350 --> 37:55.829
I normally thank you
for your service.

37:55.880 --> 37:58.781
But I'm not going
to do that today.

37:58.840 --> 38:02.446
You took an oath to _render
an impartial verdict,

38:02.490 --> 38:04.958
based on the law
and the evidence.

38:05.020 --> 38:07.534
Each and every one of you
violated that oath.

38:07.580 --> 38:08.581
MATAN: Judge!Save it, Matan.

38:08.630 --> 38:10.495
As a matter of law,

38:10.540 --> 38:11.359
I find there was
insufficient evidence

38:11.410 --> 38:13.150
to support a
conviction here,

38:13.200 --> 38:15.100
so I am vacating
the jury's verdict

38:15.160 --> 38:16.639
and entering a
judgment of acquittal.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.671
[gallery murmuring]

38:26.390 --> 38:27.903
[knocking]

38:27.950 --> 38:29.201
SCHAKOWSKY:
Come.

38:31.910 --> 38:34.344
Mrs. Florrick.

38:34.390 --> 38:35.994
How else can I help you?

38:37.270 --> 38:39.215
What you did up there--

38:39.270 --> 38:41.090
Your Honor,

38:41.140 --> 38:43.188
we earned that, right?

38:43.230 --> 38:44.185
That wasn't about

38:44.230 --> 38:46.221
_ what I said
in here earlier?

38:46.280 --> 38:47.315
Because I didn't...Mrs. Florrick.

38:48.800 --> 38:52.179
Why don't you just
say "thank you"?

38:54.500 --> 38:57.765
I have work to do. You can go.

39:09.600 --> 39:12.296
PAIGE [recorded]: Eli, I wanted
to say good-bye to you.

39:12.350 --> 39:16.821
I had a great time,
and I'll miss you.

39:18.350 --> 39:20.079
I hope you know...[phone beeps]

39:20.140 --> 39:23.303
Eli, I wanted to say
good-bye to you.

39:23.360 --> 39:28.480
I had a great time,
and I'll miss you.

39:28.540 --> 39:30.531
I hope...[phone beeps]

39:44.940 --> 39:46.669
[sighs]

39:48.470 --> 39:50.461
[knocking]

39:52.560 --> 39:53.857
I know.

39:53.910 --> 39:55.252
I'm packing for Iowa now.

39:55.300 --> 39:56.289
No.

39:56.350 --> 39:57.863
I'm sorry.

40:00.180 --> 40:01.511
Eli, can we do this...

40:01.570 --> 40:03.731
I had no idea they were
sending Jason out of town.

40:03.790 --> 40:05.610
Okay.

40:05.660 --> 40:07.218
And I know have
been too involved

40:07.270 --> 40:09.226
in your private
matters.
Okay, Eli.

40:09.270 --> 40:11.443
You're forgiven.

40:11.490 --> 40:12.969
I have to go pack.

40:13.010 --> 40:14.352
Good night.

40:17.710 --> 40:19.712
[knocking]

40:23.500 --> 40:25.456
You seem more upset
than I do.

40:29.200 --> 40:31.725
I started to care
about someone.

40:31.770 --> 40:33.761
Courtney Paige?

40:37.520 --> 40:40.296
I don't care about
a lot of people.

40:40.350 --> 40:41.772
Too much work.

40:41.830 --> 40:45.436
I mean, too much work
to make it... work.

40:47.270 --> 40:50.398
But I thought,
"This isn't so bad.

40:50.440 --> 40:52.965
"With her.

40:53.010 --> 40:54.261
I could get
used to this."

40:54.320 --> 40:55.708
Then do.

40:55.750 --> 40:57.399
Be happy, Eli.

40:57.450 --> 40:59.441
I wanted to.

41:01.060 --> 41:02.277
She went away.

41:02.320 --> 41:03.582
Where?

41:03.630 --> 41:05.848
California.

41:05.890 --> 41:07.676
Well, for how long?A year.

41:07.720 --> 41:10.450
She had...

41:10.510 --> 41:12.239
work.

41:12.290 --> 41:14.019
I'm sorry, Eli.

41:16.080 --> 41:17.206
You're nice to me.

41:17.250 --> 41:18.899
No. Just listening.

41:22.950 --> 41:25.259
I'm sorry Jason
was sent away.

41:25.300 --> 41:27.860
Eli.

41:27.920 --> 41:30.309
He's my investigator,
that's all.

41:30.350 --> 41:32.306
I know.

41:32.350 --> 41:34.693
Yeah, I know.

41:40.540 --> 41:42.622
I don't know why
I'm telling you this, Alicia,

41:42.670 --> 41:44.888
but I think you should be happy.
Call Jason.

41:46.850 --> 41:48.272
I'm okay, Eli.

41:48.330 --> 41:49.490
I don't want to be in the way.

41:49.550 --> 41:51.063
You're not._
He was my investigator.

41:51.110 --> 41:52.975
Don't let the campaign
get in your way.

41:54.070 --> 41:55.378
Okay, Eli.

41:55.420 --> 41:57.115
I'm... fine.

42:12.000 --> 42:14.525
Six years ago, you got a message
from Will Gardner,

42:14.570 --> 42:16.299
a voice mail, and I erased it.

42:19.440 --> 42:20.919
You were about to go onstage

42:20.970 --> 42:22.574
and stand beside Peter
for his S.A. run,

42:22.620 --> 42:24.963
and I didn't want to hurt that.

42:28.410 --> 42:30.184
I listened to
the voice mail.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.489
Will said he loved you

42:41.550 --> 42:45.338
And I erased it.

42:45.380 --> 42:47.075
I never let
you hear it.

42:47.120 --> 42:49.122
And I've been_sick about it
ever Since.

42:49.820 --> 42:51.424
And I don't want to stand

42:51.480 --> 42:53.562
in the way of
your happiness again.

42:55.610 --> 42:57.783
That's why I'm sorry.

43:11.320 --> 43:13.311
Get out.
