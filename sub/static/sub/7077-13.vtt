Hey. Get out of my chair,
or I'll have you disbarred.

00:05.924 --> 00:07.808
Oh, wait.
That already happened.

00:07.859 --> 00:09.443
- Cash.
- Tango.

00:09.478 --> 00:12.079

00:12.114 --> 00:14.281

00:14.316 --> 00:15.838

00:15.958 --> 00:17.075
Not unless you leave.

00:17.109 --> 00:18.660
[Chuckles] Still got it.

00:18.694 --> 00:20.929
So a little birdie told me

00:20.980 --> 00:22.847
you're graduating
kiddie college.

00:22.882 --> 00:24.616
You must be excited
to get that lollipop.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.099
Hey.
It's a sticker.

00:27.219 --> 00:27.902
Ha.

00:27.937 --> 00:30.355
I know you're busy, not,
so allow me to whip it out.

00:30.373 --> 00:31.523
Come work with me.

00:31.557 --> 00:33.091
You'll be a full partner,

three secretaries.

00:34.626 --> 00:35.694
What's that?
Not enough money?

00:35.728 --> 00:36.978
I'll double it.
Bam, done.

00:37.029 --> 00:38.613
That's how we negotiate.
Lunch?

00:38.664 --> 00:40.832
Wow.
I drive a hard bargain.

00:40.866 --> 00:43.251
But, mark, aren't you worried
I'm a little out of practice?

00:43.286 --> 00:46.137
The only cases I've tried lately
are about sandwiches and yams.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.638
Please, you were
a better lawyer

00:47.657 --> 00:48.657
when you weren't a lawyer

00:48.658 --> 00:50.041
than most lawyers I know.

00:50.076 --> 00:51.042
It's still in you.

00:51.077 --> 00:53.795
I'll give it some thought.

00:53.846 --> 00:56.085
Just shake my hand, idiot.
It's simple.

00:59.785 --> 01:00.952
I like simple.

01:00.987 --> 01:02.787
Take a look around, Winger.

01:02.821 --> 01:04.923
This is your new old life.

01:04.956 --> 01:06.257
I don't get it.

01:06.291 --> 01:08.259
We just had Christmas,
and now it's warm outside.

01:08.293 --> 01:09.344
Of course it is, dummy.

01:09.395 --> 01:10.979
We just finished
fall-spring semester.

01:11.013 --> 01:12.347
Bring on summer-winter.

01:12.398 --> 01:13.648
I can't wait.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.066
My final film school class
is just called opinions.

01:15.101 --> 01:16.251
Professor Taylor
is scheduled to teach,

01:16.285 --> 01:17.369
but I have a rebuttal.

01:17.403 --> 01:18.803
Lucky.

01:18.838 --> 01:20.772
I transferred to forensics late
and got the worst classes.

01:20.806 --> 01:23.992
Skull fragment collection,
advanced advanced decomp,

01:24.026 --> 01:26.294
and intro to senselessness
were all full.

01:26.329 --> 01:27.912
I still have a year
of A/C repair left.

01:27.930 --> 01:29.047
I passed all my classes,

01:29.081 --> 01:30.248
so now I just do yoga

01:30.282 --> 01:31.349
while the teachers
write down my wisdoms.

01:31.383 --> 01:33.735
Wait a minute.
Jeff passed history.

01:33.769 --> 01:34.986
He's graduating early.

01:35.020 --> 01:37.288
I'm totally unprepared
to deal with this.

01:37.323 --> 01:38.606
No, Annie,
please, don't--

01:38.641 --> 01:40.425
[noisemakers blowing]

01:40.459 --> 01:42.593
Well, it's official.
It's on a banner.

01:42.611 --> 01:44.045
Congratulations, Jeffrey.

01:44.080 --> 01:45.363
You worked hard
not to work hard

01:45.397 --> 01:46.414
to earn that degree.

01:46.449 --> 01:47.582
Yeah, you took
so many blow-off classes

01:47.633 --> 01:48.666
and pointless electives.

01:48.700 --> 01:49.617
What did you end up
majoring in?

01:49.652 --> 01:50.652
Education.

01:50.686 --> 01:51.870
You had to win, didn't you?

01:51.904 --> 01:53.905
When I was inches
from the finish line.

01:53.939 --> 01:54.889
Pierce, you have
so many credits,

01:54.924 --> 01:55.884
they have grand-credits.

01:55.908 --> 01:56.891
Just graduate already.

01:56.926 --> 01:58.206
When's the graduation ceremony?

01:58.210 --> 01:59.828
Never.
It's community college.

01:59.862 --> 02:02.931
You just send in some papers
and they stop charging you.

02:02.982 --> 02:04.783
It's moving, in its own way.

02:04.817 --> 02:06.034
So this is it?

02:06.068 --> 02:07.469
A banner and some soda
Troy forgot to bring?

02:07.503 --> 02:08.987
No.

02:09.020 --> 02:10.805
As far as graduations go,
it's boring but grounded.

02:10.840 --> 02:12.924
I was hoping for more.

02:12.942 --> 02:13.942
Can we at least walk with you
to the Dean's office?

02:13.976 --> 02:15.259
What, now?
No.

02:15.277 --> 02:16.894
I was just--I was going
to mail it in next week,

02:16.912 --> 02:17.962
or, you know, whenever.

02:17.997 --> 02:19.030
Don't be silly.

02:19.048 --> 02:20.169
We started as a study group,

02:20.199 --> 02:21.866
we'll finish as a study group.

02:21.884 --> 02:24.002
All for one, and one dude
we can all leave behind.

02:24.036 --> 02:24.986
Everybody, go quickly.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.054

02:26.105 --> 02:27.439

the old John Dean-cock

03:16.872 --> 03:20.775

03:20.810 --> 03:22.544
So this is it?

03:22.578 --> 03:24.262
- Mm-hmm.
- Huh.

03:24.296 --> 03:27.882
I, uh--I expected
a little more pageantry.

03:27.917 --> 03:29.884
I'm listening.

03:29.919 --> 03:31.352
Annie's right.

03:31.403 --> 03:33.638
We should throw a party
to mark the occasion.

- A small one.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.194
Maybe some flowers,
an archway--

like a wedding.

03:44.016 --> 03:46.484
Just your average,
low-key diploma signing,

03:46.518 --> 03:47.452
to which you're all
cordially invited,

03:47.486 --> 03:48.453
tomorrow afternoon.

03:48.487 --> 03:49.654
Tomorrow?

03:49.672 --> 03:51.089
Is that enough time
to plan a whole wedding?

03:51.123 --> 03:52.841
- Absolutely.
- I'll get my book.

03:52.892 --> 03:54.576

03:54.610 --> 03:57.395
Listen, I can't do a big party.

03:57.429 --> 03:58.480
It's too much.

03:58.531 --> 04:00.732
Oh, I see what's going on here.

04:00.766 --> 04:03.451
This is about you getting
cold feet about graduating.

04:03.502 --> 04:04.669
Pshh, yeah.

04:04.703 --> 04:05.637
I've been looking forward
to graduation

04:05.671 --> 04:06.921
since freshman registration.

04:06.972 --> 04:08.473
I already got a job lined up

04:08.507 --> 04:09.774
at my old partner's firm.

04:09.808 --> 04:11.676
Well, then, let them eat cake.

04:11.694 --> 04:15.063
It's just, I'm worried
that the group might not be able

04:15.114 --> 04:17.398
to handle it,
you know, emotionally.

04:17.433 --> 04:19.334
Everyone wants you
to graduate, Jeff.

04:19.385 --> 04:20.785
Well, what about Abed?

04:20.803 --> 04:22.837
I mean, the stress of me leaving
might send him spiraling.

04:22.872 --> 04:24.355
Come on,
give him some more credit.

04:24.390 --> 04:27.308
He's really progressed since
he opened up to my therapizing.

04:27.359 --> 04:28.759
Do you remember last year,
when he wouldn't stop

04:28.777 --> 04:30.612
talking about that
"darkest timeline" thing?

04:30.646 --> 04:31.963
The one where I lost my arm?

04:31.997 --> 04:33.965
And Pierce died,
and Annie went insane,

04:33.999 --> 04:35.934
and he blamed it all
on you throwing some dice.

04:35.968 --> 04:39.571
He has not brought that up
in months.

04:39.605 --> 04:42.490
You're right, Britta.

04:42.525 --> 04:44.342
I just need
to give Abed a chance.

04:44.376 --> 04:45.660
Then it's settled.

04:45.711 --> 04:47.161
The six of us will
take astronomy next semester.

04:47.213 --> 04:48.446
So now you're leaving me out.

04:48.480 --> 04:49.847
No, we're leaving Jeff out.

04:49.882 --> 04:52.083

who gets left out anymore.

04:59.925 --> 05:01.376

the wedding-graduation mash up,

05:01.410 --> 05:02.911

with women.

right?

another hang up.

No, no, no.
You've already done so much.

05:16.242 --> 05:18.910
Besides, I think I have
a fun and fair way

05:18.944 --> 05:23.548
to decide which of the six of us
will bring the soda.

07:37.549 --> 07:38.883
I'm not making you feel nervous

07:38.934 --> 07:40.301
about graduating, am I?

07:40.319 --> 07:44.372
Well, you are making me
feel something.

07:44.406 --> 07:46.991
And it's not about graduating.

07:47.025 --> 07:48.192
I'm saying I'm hot for you.

07:48.227 --> 07:50.578
Me?

07:50.612 --> 07:51.646
Is this for real?

07:51.680 --> 07:53.581
Is my beating heart for real?

07:53.615 --> 07:54.982
Oh, Annie.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.084
I don't know if it's
the beautiful decorations,

07:57.119 --> 07:59.537
or the impending
floral archway,

07:59.571 --> 08:03.674
but there's something about this
that feels so right.

08:03.709 --> 08:06.327
It's the perfect moment
to remember you by.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.979
Remember me by?

08:08.013 --> 08:09.363
I'm not going anywhere.

08:09.398 --> 08:11.349
Exactly.
You're going nowhere.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.819
I'm about to return
to my cool, adult, lawyer life,

08:14.870 --> 08:16.821
and you're going to be
stuck here, playing high school.

08:16.855 --> 08:17.855
Why are you saying this?

08:17.873 --> 08:19.323
So you face the facts.

08:19.358 --> 08:21.809
Once I graduate, I'm gone.

08:26.114 --> 08:28.499
Winger, streaking
on your last day of school?

08:28.534 --> 08:30.401
Respect.

08:30.435 --> 08:32.253
Oh, so I got the save the date
for your graduation.

08:32.287 --> 08:34.539
Should I bring a date,
or try to hook up there?

08:34.573 --> 08:36.890
I'm not going to your
stupid graduation, jerk.

08:36.924 --> 08:39.210
I can't believe you said
those things to me.

08:39.244 --> 08:40.845
- What things?
- Don't play dumb.

08:40.879 --> 08:42.263
You want to leave?
Leave.

08:42.297 --> 08:43.364
See if I care.

08:43.398 --> 08:44.882
What did you do?

08:44.917 --> 08:48.152
I have no earthly idea.

08:48.203 --> 08:51.305
Look up there.

08:54.476 --> 08:56.444
- Hello, Abed.
- Hello, Evil Jeff.

08:56.478 --> 08:57.628
What?
How did you--

08:57.663 --> 08:58.946
I may not be good
with facial expressions,

08:58.981 --> 09:00.698
but I know an evil doppelganger
when I see one.

09:00.732 --> 09:02.617
Plus your arm makes a noise
every time you move it.

09:02.651 --> 09:04.051
Silence.
[Mechanical arm whirring]

09:04.085 --> 09:05.386
Are you here to kill Jeff?

09:05.420 --> 09:07.488
Oh, you non-evils
are so naive.

09:07.522 --> 09:08.823
I'm here to save Jeff

09:08.857 --> 09:11.409
from the smothering teat
of his study group.

09:11.460 --> 09:12.420
Is that a paintball gun?

09:12.444 --> 09:17.398
You wish.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.066
Cool.

09:19.101 --> 09:21.586
Wait.
Cold.

09:21.620 --> 09:24.138
[Groans]

09:24.172 --> 09:26.107
How did I get
to the Dean's office?

09:26.141 --> 09:27.391
Hi.

09:32.581 --> 09:37.418
Out of my chair, monkey.

09:37.436 --> 09:39.370
The darkest timeline.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.426
Annie.

09:45.460 --> 09:48.262
[Sobs]

09:48.297 --> 09:51.499
Um, okay,
let's start with "Huh?"

09:51.533 --> 09:55.002
Jeff, I'm sorry.
I made it all up.

09:55.037 --> 09:57.221
I've been so upset
about you graduating

09:57.255 --> 09:59.957
that I've gone
a little crazy, emotionally.

09:59.992 --> 10:01.942
Oh, good.
I thought I was losing my mind.

10:01.977 --> 10:03.561
Make it up to you with a hug?

10:09.434 --> 10:11.936
This breakfast sandwich cart
is such a great idea.

10:11.970 --> 10:13.704
It's never too early
for Shirley--

10:13.739 --> 10:15.406
to make a boatload off
of hung over college kids.

10:15.457 --> 10:17.491
Speaking of great idea having,
hear me out.

10:17.509 --> 10:20.361
It's called
"The Troy-jan Horse."

10:20.395 --> 10:24.815
It goes bread, lettuce, ham,
ham, bacon, chocolate--

10:24.866 --> 10:26.651
Oh, how you doing,
the graduate?

10:26.685 --> 10:28.986
Just stopping by
to hand out some un-vites

10:29.021 --> 10:30.304
to my graduation.

10:30.339 --> 10:32.139
Here's one
for the desperate housewife

10:32.174 --> 10:34.675
who spends more time
with her pathetic business

10:34.693 --> 10:35.926
than with her family.

10:35.961 --> 10:37.478
And you.

10:37.496 --> 10:39.880
If you call a sandwich
a "Troy-jan Horse,"

10:39.915 --> 10:41.716
people are going
to think there's horse in it.

10:41.733 --> 10:44.685
Oh, my dreams.

10:44.720 --> 10:47.138
Whatever, losers.
See you never.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.023
Where's Abed?

10:51.226 --> 10:52.293
Is anyone here?

10:52.327 --> 10:54.412
Hello, Abed.
Welcome to our home.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.664
- Hello, Evil Abed.
- It's just Abed now.

10:56.698 --> 10:58.178
After we met,
I abandoned my evil goal

10:58.200 --> 11:00.034
to focus on brightening
my own timeline instead.

11:00.068 --> 11:01.769
- Do you live here alone?
- Yes.

11:01.803 --> 11:03.804
Evil Troy moved out
when I gave up the cause.

11:03.822 --> 11:05.406
Now he only listens
to Evil Jeff,

11:05.440 --> 11:07.024
who sort of took over this year,
villain-wise.

11:07.059 --> 11:09.043
Jeff left Greendale and
became a scummy lawyer again,

11:09.077 --> 11:10.378
but the more evil he got,

11:10.412 --> 11:11.662
the more he became tortured
by the idea

11:11.713 --> 11:13.147
that there's still
a good Jeff out there,

11:13.181 --> 11:14.665
being good somewhere.

11:14.700 --> 11:15.733
That's why he forced me
to show him

11:15.767 --> 11:17.007
how to travel
between timelines.

11:17.018 --> 11:19.253
My God.
This is so cool.

11:19.287 --> 11:20.654
I know.
You have no idea

11:20.688 --> 11:22.523
how long I've been waiting
to talk to you about it.

11:22.541 --> 11:24.041
Kind of a <i>Superman III</i>
meets that <i>Star Trek</i> episode

11:24.076 --> 11:25.509
meets season three of <i>The Cape</i>.

11:25.544 --> 11:27.094
- <i>The Cape</i> was cancelled.
- Not here.

11:27.129 --> 11:30.064
They retooled it for cable,
and it's awesome.

11:30.098 --> 11:31.065
Want to see it?

11:31.099 --> 11:32.349
Desperately.

11:32.384 --> 11:33.434
But I need to get back
to my timeline

11:33.468 --> 11:34.785
and stop Evil Jeff.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.404
So I came to the only person
who could help me--me.

11:36.438 --> 11:37.705
I'll get you home, Abed.

11:37.739 --> 11:41.125
But first,
you'll need some supplies.

11:46.932 --> 11:48.399
Everyone must be running late.

11:48.433 --> 11:50.584
Here, Jeffrey.
You're graduated.

11:50.619 --> 11:52.820
Take your precious diploma
and just go.

11:52.838 --> 11:55.389
I cannot believe
the hurtful things

11:55.424 --> 11:56.557
you said to me in my office.

11:56.591 --> 11:57.758
I'll have you know

11:57.793 --> 11:59.426
that wanting a little pageantry
in your life

11:59.444 --> 12:02.780
isn't a crime
or a lifestyle choice.

12:06.952 --> 12:10.037
Okay, Annie, something
definitely weird is happening.

12:10.071 --> 12:12.006
No one's here,
the Dean is mad at me,

12:12.040 --> 12:14.308
and he is never
mad at me, and--

12:14.342 --> 12:15.810
a third reason.

12:15.844 --> 12:17.678
Congratulations, Jeff.

12:17.696 --> 12:18.846
Don't worry
about the study group.

12:18.864 --> 12:19.945
You can talk to them later.

12:19.948 --> 12:21.232
Why don't you and I
go celebrate

12:21.283 --> 12:24.034
someplace private and boozy?

12:24.069 --> 12:25.402
Annie, why are you acting
like a mistress

12:25.437 --> 12:26.554
in a lifetime movie?

12:26.588 --> 12:28.339
[Laughs] You're funny.

12:28.373 --> 12:31.091
Oh, sweetheart,
you dropped your phone earlier.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.761
You've got a voicemail
from a guy named mark?

12:33.795 --> 12:35.062
You should call him.

12:35.096 --> 12:36.347
Not now.

12:36.398 --> 12:37.481
I have to find the others
and figure this out.

12:37.516 --> 12:40.151
Crap.
We're losing him.

12:40.185 --> 12:41.135
- What?
- What?

12:41.169 --> 12:42.453
Both: Who are you?

12:42.487 --> 12:44.155
You're me?

12:44.206 --> 12:46.106
- But how?
- But how?

12:46.124 --> 12:47.408
Enough of the pleasantries.

12:47.442 --> 12:48.803
I've come
from the darkest timeline

12:48.827 --> 12:50.828
to make sure you take that job.

12:50.879 --> 12:52.880
It's essential to our future.

12:52.914 --> 12:54.598
You want it, idiot, so take it.

12:54.633 --> 12:55.633
I can't.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.117
I've spent
almost four years here,

12:57.135 --> 12:59.303
growing and changing
and making dioramas.

12:59.337 --> 13:00.337
I'm not that guy anymore.

13:00.338 --> 13:01.639
You're wrong.

13:01.673 --> 13:04.258
Greendale may have dulled
your killer instinct,

13:04.292 --> 13:06.594
but trust me,
it's still in you.

13:06.628 --> 13:10.431
It's time to leave this place
and reclaim your proper life.

13:10.465 --> 13:13.818
No.
Not without my study group.

13:13.852 --> 13:16.203
Ugh.
Now who's in a lifetime movie?

13:16.238 --> 13:18.155
Then I'll be rid of you
another way.

13:22.444 --> 13:27.581
Friendship!

13:32.671 --> 13:34.455
Mm.
Cold.

13:34.489 --> 13:36.490
Well, the subtle approach
failed.

13:36.508 --> 13:39.260
What's next?
Explain it slowly.

13:39.294 --> 13:41.846
Need some help?

13:41.880 --> 13:44.164
Let's burn this mother down.

13:48.730 --> 13:51.776
Jeff must be graduating about now.
I wonder if anyone's there.

13:51.896 --> 13:53.079
Doubt he cares.

13:53.114 --> 13:54.831
Pierce won't even
respond to my texts.

13:54.865 --> 13:57.050
I wonder what terrible things
Jeff said about him.

13:57.084 --> 13:58.335
I've got some guesses.

13:58.369 --> 13:59.352
[All gasping]

13:59.386 --> 14:00.453
Let me finish.

14:00.488 --> 14:02.455
Look, I know this may
sound crazy,

14:02.490 --> 14:03.924
and more
than a little convenient,

14:03.958 --> 14:06.526
but whatever I said to you,
it wasn't me.

14:06.560 --> 14:07.594
It was Evil Jeff.

14:07.628 --> 14:09.279
[Scoffs] Come on.

14:09.330 --> 14:10.530
Something happened
when I rolled that die.

14:10.564 --> 14:11.581
Something terrible.

14:11.632 --> 14:12.966
Something only nerds
can understand.

14:13.000 --> 14:13.967
Mm-hmm.

14:14.001 --> 14:15.268
You have to believe me.

14:15.302 --> 14:16.519
They're coming for us.

14:16.570 --> 14:17.988
No.

14:18.039 --> 14:19.673
We're coming for them.

14:19.707 --> 14:20.657
Abed, where have you been?

14:20.691 --> 14:21.875
The darkest timeline.

14:21.909 --> 14:22.909
You guys never believe me,
so this time,

14:22.944 --> 14:25.195
I brought proof,
the doppeldeaner.

14:25.229 --> 14:26.446
[All gasping]

14:26.480 --> 14:28.321
Abed brought me here
to prove to all of you--

14:28.332 --> 14:29.749
Whoa.

14:29.784 --> 14:31.017
Actually, I figured that
these paintball warping guns

14:31.052 --> 14:32.068
would convince you.

14:32.103 --> 14:33.486
Listen up, people.

14:33.521 --> 14:34.671
We've got an inter-dimensional
battle on our hands.

14:34.705 --> 14:36.356
Our evil counterparts
are waging a war,

14:36.390 --> 14:38.241
and it's either us or us.

14:38.276 --> 14:39.643
All right.

14:39.677 --> 14:42.028
Let's light up
these dark suckers.

14:42.063 --> 14:44.397
Okay, everyone.
Stay sharp.

14:44.431 --> 14:47.133
If you see yourself,
warp on sight.

14:47.168 --> 14:50.370
I'd like to warp myself
to a dairy-free mudslide.

14:50.404 --> 14:51.655
That's just vodka, Shirley.

14:51.689 --> 14:52.638
I know what it is.

14:52.657 --> 14:53.790
Ah-ha.

14:53.824 --> 14:55.158
Pierce?

14:55.192 --> 14:56.192
We thought you were dead.

14:56.210 --> 14:57.210
Hell, no.

14:57.244 --> 14:59.296
After I got shot,
I faked my death

14:59.330 --> 15:00.930
to teach you all a lesson.

15:00.965 --> 15:02.282
Lesson about what?

15:02.316 --> 15:04.134
Who can remember?
It was more than a year ago.

15:04.168 --> 15:06.436
And yet, here you all are,

15:06.470 --> 15:08.238
planning an invasion
without me.

15:08.272 --> 15:10.740
Again,
we thought you were dead.

15:10.775 --> 15:13.376
Listen, I-I can help you guys
beat the lame study group.

15:13.411 --> 15:14.644
Just tell me how this works.

15:14.679 --> 15:15.712
Fine.

15:15.746 --> 15:17.263
It's complicated,
but basically,

15:17.281 --> 15:20.050
the first person
to shoot themselves wins.

15:20.084 --> 15:21.051
[Paintball gunshot]

15:21.085 --> 15:22.569
Winner.

15:22.603 --> 15:24.020
Well, that bow tied itself.

15:24.055 --> 15:25.905
Dang, I got hair dye
on my coat.

15:25.940 --> 15:27.907
Dang, it's spreading.

15:27.942 --> 15:28.892
Damn it, Britta.

15:28.926 --> 15:30.126
Did you shoot yourself too?

15:30.177 --> 15:31.094
Every time.

15:31.128 --> 15:32.095
Hey.

15:32.146 --> 15:34.814
Don't talk to her like that.

15:34.848 --> 15:35.765
Every time.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.417
We're here.
Scatter.

15:45.059 --> 15:48.078
Get help.

15:48.112 --> 15:50.747
Can't hide forever, lame Annie.

15:50.781 --> 15:52.048
Just let me shoot you.

15:52.083 --> 15:54.200
You'll love
the darkest timeline.

15:54.234 --> 15:56.086
We're sleeping with Jeff there.

15:56.120 --> 15:57.604
What?
We are?

15:57.638 --> 15:59.439
All the time.

15:59.473 --> 16:02.509
And he loves it.

16:02.543 --> 16:04.160
[Grunts]

16:04.211 --> 16:06.463
Nobody sleeps with Jeff.

16:06.497 --> 16:09.048
Not even me.

16:11.569 --> 16:12.986
I've been counting bullets.

16:13.020 --> 16:14.020
One of us is out.

16:14.055 --> 16:15.722
- Is it you?
- Yes.

16:15.756 --> 16:17.307
Why would you tell me that?

16:17.309 --> 16:19.259
To sound intimidating.

16:21.423 --> 16:27.644
Oh. Almost worked.

16:27.651 --> 16:30.403
Ballin'.

16:30.421 --> 16:34.257
[Indistinct yelling]

16:34.291 --> 16:35.925
Okay.
Only Evil Jeff is left.

16:35.976 --> 16:37.177
You've got to take him out.

16:37.211 --> 16:38.311
Why don't I just give him
what he wants?

16:38.345 --> 16:39.696
What?
You can't give up now.

16:39.747 --> 16:41.564
- Why not?
- Because it's not real.

16:41.599 --> 16:42.782
Look around, Jeff.

16:42.800 --> 16:43.967
Haven't you noticed
the vending machines

16:44.001 --> 16:46.753
are full of meats
and hard-boiled eggs?

16:46.787 --> 16:47.821
Or that
all the background students

16:47.855 --> 16:50.273
are attractive women?

16:50.324 --> 16:51.791
Hi.

16:51.826 --> 16:53.126
Yeah.

16:53.160 --> 16:55.245
This is a world you've created
in your own mind.

16:55.279 --> 16:56.796
The real battle is within.

16:56.814 --> 16:58.297
You're afraid to graduate
because you think

16:58.315 --> 17:00.100
Greendale has
changed you too much.

17:00.134 --> 17:01.534
So part of you
wants Evil Jeff to win,

17:01.569 --> 17:02.869
because then you could
go backwards

17:02.903 --> 17:04.237
and pretend you're the same guy
you were four years ago.

17:04.271 --> 17:06.055
But you're not.
You're stronger.

17:06.089 --> 17:08.074
You're better.
You have friends.

17:08.108 --> 17:09.608
No, screw that.
You have a family.

17:09.643 --> 17:11.478
Wait.

17:11.512 --> 17:12.612
If this is all in my mind,

17:12.646 --> 17:14.047
then I don't really need
to fight him.

17:14.080 --> 17:16.465
Don't logic this one
away from me.

17:16.500 --> 17:18.951
We finally figured out a way
to make paintball cool again.

17:23.441 --> 17:24.390
Hey, handsome.

17:34.601 --> 17:37.537
[Yelling]

17:48.632 --> 17:50.183
On second thought,

17:50.217 --> 17:51.568
who needs to roll a die?

17:51.602 --> 17:53.036
And who cares if we have soda?

17:53.070 --> 17:54.821
As long as you guys
are with me,

17:54.855 --> 17:57.056
I have everything I need
to graduate.

17:57.091 --> 18:00.093
Yeah.
Forget soda.

18:00.127 --> 18:04.080
Friends, Greendalians,
human beings,

18:04.114 --> 18:05.899
we are gathered here today
to honor

18:05.933 --> 18:10.537
that sacred and eternal bond
between a student and his Dean.

18:10.571 --> 18:13.840
Neither time nor distance
nor screening one's calls

18:13.874 --> 18:17.260
could ever sever what
nature herself has ordained.

18:17.311 --> 18:18.511
When two men are drawn--

18:18.546 --> 18:19.612
I'll take it from here, Craig.

18:19.646 --> 18:23.283
Fair enough.
I was reaching.

18:23.317 --> 18:25.869
Three and a half years ago,
when I came to Greendale,

18:25.903 --> 18:28.204
I met six
very important people.

18:28.239 --> 18:30.423
Ooh.
Burn on Britta.

18:30.441 --> 18:31.491
Sorry, seven.

18:31.525 --> 18:34.994
And meeting these people
changed my life.

18:35.029 --> 18:36.898
Yep.

18:39.216 --> 18:41.334
I'm sorry.
I-I don't know what to say.

18:41.368 --> 18:42.335
[All laughing]

18:42.353 --> 18:43.770
- Yeah, okay.
- Whatever.

18:43.804 --> 18:45.522
I'm so used to being the guy

18:45.556 --> 18:47.557
who can talk his way
out of anything,

18:47.608 --> 18:51.611
but what do you say
when you don't want a way out?

18:51.629 --> 18:56.299
What you all have done
for me is indescribable.

18:56.333 --> 18:57.550
It's unbelievable.

18:57.585 --> 19:02.105
And my love for you
is immeasurable,

19:02.156 --> 19:06.643
even when you split it
seven ways.

19:06.677 --> 19:09.829
Well said, Jeffrey.

19:09.863 --> 19:12.582
If anyone here
should have just cause

19:12.616 --> 19:15.051
why Jeffrey Tobias Winger
should not be graduated,

19:15.102 --> 19:16.686
speak now
or forever--

19:16.720 --> 19:18.054
[knocking on window]

19:18.105 --> 19:19.305
Pierce.

19:19.339 --> 19:20.440
You don't have to do this.

19:20.474 --> 19:21.441
I'm ready to graduate.

19:21.475 --> 19:23.192
Yeah?

19:23.227 --> 19:24.944
Well, I'm ready
to graduate first.

19:24.979 --> 19:27.847
Seems oddly appropriate.

19:27.865 --> 19:29.849
Congratulations, Pierce.

19:29.867 --> 19:31.234
[Applause]

19:35.489 --> 19:37.206
Perfect.

19:37.241 --> 19:39.208
So what's next
for Jeffrey Winger?

19:39.243 --> 19:41.878
I'm thinking I might look
into some small local firms.

19:41.912 --> 19:43.796
I'm going to use my big mouth
to help the little guy.

19:43.831 --> 19:44.881
Both: Aww.

19:44.915 --> 19:45.999
Plus, if I stay in town,

19:46.033 --> 19:47.750
I can pop by any time I want.

19:47.801 --> 19:50.036
You know, just to settle
any group arguments

19:50.054 --> 19:51.287
about who misses me the most.

19:51.322 --> 19:52.905
Oh--

19:52.940 --> 19:54.223
What do you think?

19:54.258 --> 19:55.865
- To Jeff.
- To Jeffrey.

20:03.245 --> 20:05.297
♪ Troy and Abed in the morning ♪

20:05.417 --> 20:05.939
Welcome back.

20:06.059 --> 20:07.710
We've got a jam-packed show,
so let's get started.

20:07.755 --> 20:08.705
Today, as always,

20:08.756 --> 20:09.957
we'll be visited once again

20:09.991 --> 20:11.157
by Greendale's king
and supreme lord master,

20:11.175 --> 20:12.509
Dean Chang.

20:12.543 --> 20:14.543
Looks like he'll be
talking about squash this time.

20:14.615 --> 20:16.065
Oh, I'm super excited for that.

20:16.083 --> 20:18.251
And not only
because it's mandatory.

20:18.285 --> 20:20.036
But first, we'll take a spin
around the timeline map

20:20.070 --> 20:21.487
and find out what's happening
in the universes

20:21.522 --> 20:23.239
that parallel ours.

20:25.175 --> 20:26.259
Thanks, us.

20:26.293 --> 20:27.544
I'm standing here
in timeline five,

20:27.578 --> 20:28.978
where things
are pretty much normal.

20:29.013 --> 20:30.013
Normal?

20:30.047 --> 20:32.015
Troy, people are on fire
in Nairobi.

20:32.049 --> 20:33.883
You call that normal?

20:33.917 --> 20:36.102
I've become much more conscious
of world issues

20:36.136 --> 20:39.472
since Troy and I decided to give
our baby an African name.

20:39.523 --> 20:41.691
Isn't that right, Chewbacca?

20:41.725 --> 20:43.259
It means,
"He who hunts bounties."

20:43.277 --> 20:44.731
Back to you.

20:46.196 --> 20:48.998
Wow, it sounds like things are
really heating up in Nairobi.

20:49.033 --> 20:50.033
That's nothing compared
to the fire

20:50.067 --> 20:52.318
in our studio audience.

20:52.353 --> 20:53.570
Hey, idiots.

20:53.604 --> 20:54.637
How many times have I told you,

20:54.672 --> 20:56.072
the show doesn't really exist.

20:56.106 --> 20:58.074
No one's watching.

20:58.108 --> 20:59.826
Duh-doy.
We know.

20:59.877 --> 21:01.077
Yeah, we're just
messing around.

21:01.111 --> 21:02.078
See you at lunch, Evil Jeff.

21:02.112 --> 21:03.474
See you at lunch.

21:05.782 --> 21:08.143
