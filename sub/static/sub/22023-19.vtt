00:02.031 --> 00:06.311
The Missouri lottery is the
highest it's been in 20 years.

00:06.365 --> 00:08.295
Oh, man, I'd love to win the lottery.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.447
Yeah, I'd stop washing
the sheets on my futon.

00:10.563 --> 00:12.250
I'd just buy new ones every day.

00:12.313 --> 00:13.913
I'd get a bunch of vintage Jordans.

00:13.915 --> 00:15.848
But like, Michael Jordan's Jordans.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.920
I want the actual shoes off his feet.

00:17.982 --> 00:20.520
If I won, you would
not see me here tomorrow.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.889
That is for sure. I would be taking

00:22.957 --> 00:24.790
Thursdays off from now on.

00:24.826 --> 00:28.261
- I'd buy a private island.
- That's my plan too!

00:28.329 --> 00:29.812
I'd go to really expensive stores,

00:29.898 --> 00:31.697
hoping that white women
would be rude to me,

00:31.766 --> 00:34.100
so I could come back with
a bunch of bags and be like,

00:34.135 --> 00:36.062
a ha, big mistake.

00:36.554 --> 00:37.390
Like "Pretty Woman."

00:37.453 --> 00:39.372
I'd drop everything
and travel the world.

00:39.407 --> 00:40.940
You know? No plans, no ties.

00:40.975 --> 00:43.492
Just me and the open road.

00:43.578 --> 00:45.244
So if you're ditching Kelly, dibs.

00:45.313 --> 00:46.753
- Oh, no, I didn't...
- Yeah, no.

00:46.855 --> 00:49.048
Enjoy the open road. Send me a postcard.

00:49.133 --> 00:50.833
I could probably make Thursdays work,

00:50.919 --> 00:52.068
if they really needed me.

00:52.153 --> 00:53.486
If I won, I would resurrect

00:53.555 --> 00:54.887
and then own the dodo.

00:54.956 --> 00:57.050
I'd donate my winnings
to my favorite charity.

00:57.105 --> 00:59.225
They pair wounded veterans
with dogs who have been rescued

00:59.294 --> 01:00.633
from dog-fighting rings.

01:00.635 --> 01:03.190
Part of their therapy is
making art that they sell

01:03.191 --> 01:05.373
to raise funds
for the children's hospital.

01:05.373 --> 01:06.235
It's beautiful.

01:10.178 --> 01:13.216
I, well, I mean,
I would also give to charity.

01:13.217 --> 01:14.458
Yeah, I mean, that's obviously...

01:14.473 --> 01:15.908
Of course I'd give.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.623
Not me. I'll stick with my Jordans idea.

01:17.624 --> 01:19.364
The island would be more of a refuge

01:19.433 --> 01:21.837
for like, animals
or orphans or something.

01:22.585 --> 01:23.674
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

01:25.172 --> 01:28.347
Synced and corrected by hawken45
for www.addic7ed.com

01:30.344 --> 01:32.794
Ooh, someone's all dressed up.

01:32.795 --> 01:34.429
Family court?

01:34.515 --> 01:36.844
Oh, God, I hope it's not
family court, is it?

01:36.845 --> 01:39.001
No, I'm asking Glenn for a raise.

01:39.086 --> 01:41.160
It's just, between the divorce

01:41.161 --> 01:43.455
and putting money away
for Emma's college,

01:43.524 --> 01:46.731
and my car just started making
this, like, maaaa sound.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.760
So it's like, what am I supposed to do?

01:48.762 --> 01:50.249
Wait a minute, are you actually nervous?

01:50.250 --> 01:52.991
- This is Glenn, he loves you.
- I know, it's just, like,

01:53.429 --> 01:56.351
makes me feel self-conscious
to ask for money.

01:56.437 --> 01:58.935
See, this is the problem.
Women aren't socialized

01:58.936 --> 02:01.073
to advocate for higher wages
despite the fact that...

02:01.141 --> 02:02.997
Mm-hmm, I'm going to need you
to turn off podcast mode.

02:02.998 --> 02:03.702
Thanks.

02:04.545 --> 02:05.471
Fair enough.

02:06.293 --> 02:10.423
- 3, 22.
- Oh, those are good.

02:10.424 --> 02:13.452
I picked random ones like 14 and 34.

02:13.520 --> 02:14.687
Those are like, the random ones

02:14.688 --> 02:17.127
that no one picks, so
that's kind of a good plan.

02:17.128 --> 02:17.793
Okay.

02:19.026 --> 02:21.749
Hey, if you won, do you think
we'd still be friends?

02:22.025 --> 02:23.228
Chey, of course.

02:23.431 --> 02:24.734
You'd be my friend from my poor life

02:24.740 --> 02:26.147
who keeps me grounded.

02:26.406 --> 02:27.839
But, then again, I don't
know if I want to keep

02:27.876 --> 02:29.748
a poor person around,
just bumming everyone out.

02:29.816 --> 02:30.514
Ugh.

02:31.551 --> 02:33.648
We could buy our tickets together

02:33.925 --> 02:36.964
- and whoever wins, we split it.
- Cool, let's do it.

02:38.379 --> 02:39.624
Oh, my God, what if I pick

02:39.625 --> 02:44.255
something super out
there, like 41 or 50?

02:44.344 --> 02:46.285
Oh, my God, yes. You have to.

02:49.456 --> 02:53.727
Hey, so, uh, before.
That wasn't anything, right?

02:53.728 --> 02:57.387
Like, of course I wouldn't just
ditch you if I won the lottery.

02:57.450 --> 02:59.384
Yeah, I know, I was just
giving you a hard time.

02:59.385 --> 03:01.736
Okay, good, yeah, yeah,
I mean, you know.

03:02.686 --> 03:04.269
I wasn't, like, saying what I would do.

03:04.338 --> 03:05.940
I was just talking, like,
wildest fantasies.

03:05.941 --> 03:08.851
Oh, okay, so yeah, no,
all you're saying is,

03:08.865 --> 03:10.582
I'm not in your wildest fantasies.

03:10.780 --> 03:12.444
No, no, no, no, I just meant like,

03:12.513 --> 03:14.803
a hypothetical world
where you're not there.

03:14.928 --> 03:17.375
- So dead in your fantasy.
- No, no, no, no.

03:17.376 --> 03:19.734
I just meant, no,
it's like an alternate timeline

03:19.735 --> 03:21.669
where, like, you never
existed in the first place.

03:21.670 --> 03:23.396
Okay, seriously, stop.

03:23.961 --> 03:25.894
I can't take this much romance.

03:29.830 --> 03:32.594
Oh, hey, uh, Glenn, um,
whenever you get a chance,

03:32.595 --> 03:34.297
could we talk about something?

03:34.442 --> 03:36.676
Oh, well I have a chance right now.

03:36.729 --> 03:39.210
- Shoot.
- Oh, um...

03:39.781 --> 03:42.441
No, no, I meant like, later.
Like, in your office.

03:42.509 --> 03:44.548
But, or now. No-no-no, now's good.

03:44.549 --> 03:46.283
- Now's great yeah.
- Now, okay.

03:46.284 --> 03:48.658
Uh, so...

03:48.659 --> 03:50.204
Uh, as you know...

03:51.085 --> 03:53.652
Well, I mean, before I...
before I go there,

03:53.721 --> 03:56.587
I should say that I, um,

03:57.156 --> 03:59.747
Uh, I feel like, um,

04:00.172 --> 04:03.474
I feel like I've...
I've proven myself to be

04:03.476 --> 04:06.907
uh, reliable, and pretty sturdy,

04:06.908 --> 04:10.117
Um, well, sturdy's not
really the word...

04:10.118 --> 04:11.970
Uh, excuse me, I'm sorry.

04:11.971 --> 04:13.955
How do these toilet stools work?

04:13.956 --> 04:16.241
Do you just sit down
and put your feet on it,

04:16.310 --> 04:18.714
or double over and
grab onto it for dear life?

04:20.398 --> 04:23.016
Well, that's annoying.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.013
- I know, right?
- Why are you agreeing with me?

04:26.153 --> 04:27.419
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

04:27.488 --> 04:28.196
Sorry.

04:29.008 --> 04:31.315
Check out this text from
Colleen at the Bel-Ridge store.

04:31.316 --> 04:32.580
"Biggest jackpot ever.

04:32.581 --> 04:34.410
Wonder who's gonna
sell the most tickets."

04:34.411 --> 04:35.932
She's so competitive,

04:36.194 --> 04:38.523
with her smug cancer survivor smirk.

04:38.524 --> 04:40.275
She sounds like a real piece of work.

04:40.276 --> 04:41.800
You don't even know her.

04:42.321 --> 04:44.986
Why are some women so quick
to judge other women?

04:44.987 --> 04:45.962
I don't know.

04:46.792 --> 04:48.979
I need to find a way
to sell more tickets than her.

04:48.980 --> 04:51.474
- Beat her at her own game.
- Uh-huh.

04:51.912 --> 04:53.038
Don't say "uh-huh."

04:53.135 --> 04:54.765
You don't even know the rest of it.

04:54.825 --> 04:56.145
I don't know why I do it.

04:56.575 --> 04:58.095
Without going into too many details,

04:58.096 --> 05:00.114
the Squatty Potty
basically saved our marriage.

05:00.115 --> 05:02.045
You don't have to push.
It just slides out.

05:02.046 --> 05:03.154
I want a raise!

05:05.492 --> 05:06.861
I'm sorry, that was bad timing.

05:06.862 --> 05:08.975
I was looking for a pause
in the conversation.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.292
Really. There wasn't one.

05:10.293 --> 05:12.241
It was surprisingly a very rich topic.

05:12.609 --> 05:14.266
Okay, well, I will give it a try.

05:14.828 --> 05:15.937
I can always bring it back, right?

05:15.938 --> 05:17.733
Yeah, though you won't want to.

05:18.764 --> 05:21.732
- So...
- Amy, you deserve a raise.

05:22.199 --> 05:24.126
- Thank you.
- But ever since Laurie

05:24.127 --> 05:25.904
was made district manager,
I'm not allowed

05:25.905 --> 05:28.294
to give raises anymore. Or hugs.

05:28.519 --> 05:30.151
Yeah, no, I, uh...

05:30.683 --> 05:32.967
I'm sorry, I shouldn't
have brought that up.

05:32.968 --> 05:35.423
Aw, Amy. Come here.

05:35.736 --> 05:37.673
Nope, I can't do that.

05:38.659 --> 05:40.411
Look, why don't we hug ourselves,

05:40.412 --> 05:42.410
- and then imagine it?
- No, I'm okay.

05:42.496 --> 05:44.429
- No, no, come on.
- I'm... I'm...

05:44.498 --> 05:46.013
- Here you go.
- Okay.

05:46.731 --> 05:49.029
There you... there you go.

05:49.201 --> 05:52.437
â™ª

05:53.100 --> 05:55.420
I know we're not going
to win, but if we do,

05:55.421 --> 05:58.118
should we get our money
up-front or in installments?

05:58.119 --> 05:59.651
Hmm, I don't know.

06:00.057 --> 06:01.832
Some of my cousins might
try to kill me for the money,

06:01.833 --> 06:03.881
but with installments,
they'll need me alive.

06:03.882 --> 06:06.171
Okay, but if we get the money now,

06:06.172 --> 06:08.148
we could buy something really baller.

06:08.149 --> 06:10.830
Like, maybe a robot that plays music

06:10.831 --> 06:12.779
and is also your dentist and stuff.

06:13.104 --> 06:16.469
Or a yacht, but the captain
is an ape wearing a sailor hat.

06:16.841 --> 06:18.491
If we get a yacht,
do you think we can get

06:18.492 --> 06:20.732
- Mariah Carey to perform on it?
- Oh, yeah.

06:20.733 --> 06:22.414
I want her to sing all of her songs,

06:22.415 --> 06:24.469
and then tell her, "Sorry, Mariah."

06:24.470 --> 06:26.087
"It's not 1994 anymore.

06:26.088 --> 06:28.400
Go cut up some cucumber for our water."

06:28.486 --> 06:29.512
Yes!

06:29.513 --> 06:31.516
Not only did you not get the raise,

06:31.929 --> 06:34.093
you ended up apologizing to him?

06:34.100 --> 06:35.552
I hadn't planned on asking for a raise

06:35.553 --> 06:37.380
while holding a toilet accessory.

06:38.008 --> 06:39.540
I'm sorry, how is this okay?

06:39.706 --> 06:41.430
Isn't there a problem
with people eating these?

06:41.522 --> 06:43.934
Yeah, that's not good.
So wait, hold on, that's it?

06:43.935 --> 06:46.268
You're just going to
take no for an answer?

06:46.337 --> 06:49.075
- Well, what more can I do?
- Take it to Laurie.

06:49.481 --> 06:51.207
Okay, yeah, I'll just mention it to her

06:51.275 --> 06:52.235
the next time she's here.

06:52.236 --> 06:53.515
Ooh, vanilla flavored.

06:53.945 --> 06:55.002
Now I kind of want to try one.

06:55.003 --> 06:56.086
You can't keep waiting around

06:56.087 --> 06:57.656
for the perfect time to ask for a raise

06:57.657 --> 06:59.165
or it's never going to happen.

06:59.298 --> 07:01.783
You should do it now while you
still got your business suit on.

07:01.784 --> 07:03.198
It would be a phone call.

07:03.199 --> 07:04.092
Yeah, but,

07:04.556 --> 07:06.522
she'll hear that business-suit energy.

07:06.524 --> 07:09.378
My mouth is watering.
I can't be around these.

07:11.516 --> 07:15.664
For the next number, uh, 30? 31?

07:15.733 --> 07:17.032
There's really no wrong answer.

07:17.101 --> 07:18.901
You just need to pick another number.

07:18.970 --> 07:21.584
30. No, no, no, no, 31.

07:22.039 --> 07:24.095
- Great, 31 it is.
- No, no, no, mm-mm.

07:24.256 --> 07:26.289
You sounded like
you weren't too into that.

07:26.291 --> 07:27.874
Was 31 a mistake?

07:28.116 --> 07:29.897
- What would you do?
- Well, it's tough.

07:29.947 --> 07:33.572
Because if you pick 30,
you're not gonna win.

07:33.573 --> 07:35.628
- Mm-hmm.
- But if you pick 31,

07:35.629 --> 07:37.570
you're also not gonna win.

07:37.571 --> 07:41.295
So it really depends
on how you want to not win.

07:43.294 --> 07:44.902
- You're a dick.
- Mm-hmm.

07:45.770 --> 07:48.975
Wait, no, it was 31 the whole time.

07:51.843 --> 07:53.602
Dina, I thought about what you said

07:53.609 --> 07:55.671
about women not
supporting other women...

07:55.672 --> 07:56.952
Jesus, just get on with it.

07:56.953 --> 07:58.802
I don't have time for the preamble.

07:58.990 --> 08:00.504
Garrett's being rude to the customers.

08:00.519 --> 08:02.607
A few of them left
before buying lottery tickets.

08:02.608 --> 08:04.161
- What?
- I thought you might want to know

08:04.162 --> 08:06.365
since you're trying to
sell more tickets than Colleen.

08:06.450 --> 08:07.750
Thank you for letting me know.

08:07.818 --> 08:08.794
This is helpful.

08:09.420 --> 08:11.770
Also, Elias has been stealing
discontinued light bulbs.

08:11.856 --> 08:13.123
I hate tattletales!

08:15.166 --> 08:17.059
<i>Laurie Neustadt's office. This is Skye.</i>

08:17.128 --> 08:20.752
- Uh, yes, hi, um, is she in?
<i>- Who is calling?</i>

08:20.967 --> 08:22.111
Amy Dubanowski.

08:22.533 --> 08:25.067
<i>She's not available right now.
Can I take a message?</i>

08:25.136 --> 08:27.393
Um, yeah, could you just
let her know that...

08:27.394 --> 08:29.884
No, no, sorry, is she there?

08:30.241 --> 08:31.956
<i>No, she's not available.</i>

08:31.957 --> 08:34.188
Because you asked who was calling,

08:34.188 --> 08:36.438
and only then did you say
she was unavailable

08:36.438 --> 08:38.650
which implies, to me,
that she is available;

08:38.650 --> 08:40.366
she just doesn't want to take our call.

08:40.451 --> 08:43.722
<i>Um, she's just not available.</i>

08:44.813 --> 08:48.773
Listen, Skye.
I think you're lying to me.

08:48.942 --> 08:52.118
So why don't you do your job
and get her on the phone?

08:53.347 --> 08:54.775
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

08:54.994 --> 08:56.598
<i>I don't really know what I'm doing.</i>

08:56.667 --> 08:58.136
<i>But Miss Neustadt is...</i>

08:58.137 --> 08:59.768
<i>she's a friend of my dad's friend and...</i>

08:59.769 --> 09:01.437
You know what, I'm sorry.

09:01.505 --> 09:03.238
This really isn't my phone call.

09:03.307 --> 09:05.388
Take it away, Amy.

09:05.389 --> 09:07.476
Uh, hey, uh, Syke?

09:07.545 --> 09:08.247
- It's Amy again.
<i>- Hi.</i>

09:08.248 --> 09:09.826
Um, you're doing great.

09:09.827 --> 09:10.941
<i>- Thank you.</i>
- You're doing really great.

09:10.942 --> 09:13.388
Listen, could you just
tell her that I called?

09:13.481 --> 09:16.185
<i>Okay, and what is this regarding?</i>

09:16.253 --> 09:19.766
Um, it's regarding me
asking for a raise.

09:19.977 --> 09:21.824
<i>Oh, um, well, if it's
just about a raise,</i>

09:21.859 --> 09:23.915
<i>Laurie has a protocol for that.</i>

09:25.029 --> 09:25.712
Money.

09:26.439 --> 09:29.445
No matter how much you make,
it never seems like enough.

09:29.446 --> 09:31.841
But with a little planning,
you'll see that a budget

09:31.842 --> 09:33.978
is like a raise you give yourself.

09:36.006 --> 09:38.006
â™ª Oh, what a night Oh, what a night â™ª

09:38.075 --> 09:42.010
â™ª Oh, yes, it's ladies' night,
and the feeling's right â™ª

09:42.063 --> 09:45.640
Let's look at a typical budget
for a Cloud 9 employee.

09:45.641 --> 09:48.296
We'll call her Penny Wise.

09:48.297 --> 09:50.533
Oh, because she's a killer
clown that lives in the sewer?

09:50.534 --> 09:52.189
What? No.

09:52.454 --> 09:53.686
What, wait, I don't think so.

09:53.779 --> 09:56.175
I don't see any expense for food.

09:56.260 --> 09:58.894
I mean, personally, I... I like food.

09:58.979 --> 10:00.746
Anybody else a food person?

10:01.999 --> 10:03.247
Wow, almost all of you.

10:03.248 --> 10:06.411
Well, there's $100 under "other."

10:06.570 --> 10:07.919
That's probably for food.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.773
So we're supposed to live on
under $4 a day for food?

10:10.841 --> 10:12.106
Just don't go eating lobster.

10:12.107 --> 10:14.042
Or just get one lobster and just eat it

10:14.111 --> 10:16.218
a little bit at a time over
the course of several weeks.

10:16.219 --> 10:17.103
That's what I do.

10:17.104 --> 10:18.401
There's no line for

10:18.402 --> 10:20.576
child care, or going to the doctor.

10:20.577 --> 10:22.919
Probably because
they're just planning on us

10:22.920 --> 10:24.488
not getting sick, right?

10:24.607 --> 10:27.007
I eat two-week-old
unrefrigerated lobster.

10:27.175 --> 10:28.504
I'm going to get sick.

10:29.026 --> 10:32.561
So, I just managed to get us
a reservation tonight

10:32.630 --> 10:34.944
at the Italian place with
the Irish name that you love.

10:34.945 --> 10:36.498
O'Brien's Osteria?

10:36.567 --> 10:38.108
Oh, they have the best spaghetti.

10:38.109 --> 10:39.668
It wasn't easy, by the way.
They don't have a host

10:39.737 --> 10:42.070
that takes reservations,
so I had to track down

10:42.139 --> 10:43.505
the owner at a spin class.

10:43.574 --> 10:45.267
I feel like you're just
trying to make up for

10:45.268 --> 10:47.897
totally ditching me in your
lottery fantasy world.

10:48.010 --> 10:50.790
Could be, but I won't be ditching you

10:50.791 --> 10:53.715
as we go home to watch
the Hallmark romantic comedy

10:53.784 --> 10:55.184
of your choosing,

10:55.252 --> 10:57.715
and I won't poke holes
in any of the stories.

10:57.840 --> 11:00.108
Not even if the guy is revealed to be

11:00.109 --> 11:02.418
- the girl's childhood pen pal?
- Nope.

11:03.344 --> 11:04.619
That's, that's just a...

11:05.629 --> 11:07.528
wonderful coincidence.

11:08.041 --> 11:10.200
What else can we do to have
luxury on a budget?

11:10.201 --> 11:11.800
Sometimes, I pee in the shower.

11:11.869 --> 11:13.245
It helps save toilet water.

11:13.246 --> 11:15.580
It's not why I do it, but it's a plus.

11:16.019 --> 11:19.227
I do it to wash my feet.
Urine is sterile.

11:19.228 --> 11:20.742
I save my bathwater to water

11:20.794 --> 11:22.641
the plants in my garden, and vice versa.

11:22.642 --> 11:25.207
We could cut down
on things like lotto tickets.

11:25.583 --> 11:28.171
Or buy more lotto tickets, depending
on whether we win or not.

11:28.172 --> 11:30.152
My friend, Corona,
just keeps her webcams on

11:30.221 --> 11:32.126
all day in her bedroom and her bathroom.

11:32.127 --> 11:33.815
She makes thousands of dollars.

11:33.816 --> 11:35.703
You could be on the lookout
for loose coins.

11:35.704 --> 11:37.459
Vending machines, couch cushions,

11:37.545 --> 11:39.940
the ground near parking meters,
fountains.

11:40.107 --> 11:43.091
ABG. Always Be Gathering.

11:43.217 --> 11:45.695
Or, what if this company
just gave us a little bit

11:45.696 --> 11:47.166
more money so we wouldn't
have to scrounge

11:47.167 --> 11:48.925
for money like street urchins?

11:48.926 --> 11:52.091
This one guy paid Corona $10,000

11:52.092 --> 11:53.397
to fart on a cake.

11:53.577 --> 11:55.071
She went to Cabo.

11:55.072 --> 11:56.499
Oh, well, uh...

11:57.189 --> 12:00.657
Okay, moving on.
Section three, Social Services.

12:00.659 --> 12:03.593
Uncle Sam has your food. Now go get it!

12:04.135 --> 12:05.934
While you were at the
meeting I was checking out

12:05.935 --> 12:08.860
Laurie's Instagram
to see how unavailable she is.

12:09.649 --> 12:10.124
What?

12:10.751 --> 12:13.431
"Nice day for a drive, a golfing drive,

12:13.704 --> 12:16.164
'cause this minx is hitting the links."

12:16.595 --> 12:17.216
Jesus.

12:17.486 --> 12:19.902
The course is not that far from here.

12:19.903 --> 12:22.191
You could just happen to run into her

12:22.192 --> 12:23.320
and then bring up the raise.

12:23.321 --> 12:25.457
I think stalking her on social media

12:25.458 --> 12:27.932
and then hunting her down
while she's playing golf

12:28.018 --> 12:29.634
might come off as a little pushy.

12:29.636 --> 12:31.366
It would come off as a lot pushy.

12:31.367 --> 12:34.689
But pushy people are the ones
that get what they want.

12:34.725 --> 12:36.547
You got to have chutzpah.

12:36.860 --> 12:38.945
- "Chutzpah"?
- Chutzpah.

12:40.530 --> 12:42.857
Okay, fine. But you're coming with me.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.494
- Deal.
- God, you're annoying.

12:45.819 --> 12:48.621
- Annoying or pushy?
- Annoying.

12:50.060 --> 12:56.878
Went with 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42.

12:57.393 --> 12:58.837
You picked the numbers from "Lost."

12:58.838 --> 13:00.092
Yeah, are you a fan?

13:00.093 --> 13:01.959
No. Take your business elsewhere.

13:03.753 --> 13:05.337
Hey, you're scaring off customers.

13:05.338 --> 13:06.860
I'm scaring off gambling addicts.

13:06.861 --> 13:08.757
Oh, and you don't care
about the $5,000 bonus

13:08.842 --> 13:10.425
that goes to whoever sells
the winning ticket?

13:10.510 --> 13:11.843
Oh, boy, you think I'm that gullible?

13:11.928 --> 13:14.062
Hey, Sandra, how much does the employee

13:14.097 --> 13:16.231
who sells a winning lotto ticket get?

13:16.266 --> 13:17.785
$5,000.

13:17.786 --> 13:21.042
Look, even if that was true,
which I don't believe it is,

13:21.043 --> 13:23.017
you think I'm just
going to start hauling ass

13:23.018 --> 13:24.593
in the 1-in-7-million chance

13:24.594 --> 13:26.074
that I'm going to sell
the winning ticket?

13:26.109 --> 13:28.109
I didn't ask you to do anything.

13:32.836 --> 13:34.900
Damn it. All right, come on, people.

13:34.902 --> 13:36.047
Let's get this line moving.

13:36.048 --> 13:37.696
You can't win if you don't play.

13:37.731 --> 13:39.051
Let's see what you got here.

13:39.052 --> 13:41.344
We should have a
saltwater pool on the yacht.

13:41.345 --> 13:42.988
Not to swim in, just to be like,

13:42.989 --> 13:45.392
"Hey, ocean, we don't need you.
We've got our own."

13:45.393 --> 13:47.946
And we should hire someone
to bury treasure for us,

13:47.947 --> 13:50.382
- and then we get to find it.
- Is this all on the yacht?

13:50.383 --> 13:52.327
Everything is happening on the yacht.

13:52.412 --> 13:53.404
We are done with land.

13:53.405 --> 13:56.193
You guys know you wouldn't get all
30 million if you won, right?

13:56.834 --> 13:58.008
What are you talking about?

13:58.086 --> 14:01.187
Well, if you want it
all at once, you'd get 18.

14:02.312 --> 14:04.516
Oh, well, I mean, you know,
that's still pretty...

14:04.517 --> 14:08.056
And then, after taxes, 11.
So that's 5 1/2 each.

14:08.337 --> 14:11.687
5 1/2 million?

14:11.688 --> 14:13.672
I guess that's something, right?

14:14.270 --> 14:17.377
- I mean, it's more than we have.
- I guess.

14:18.892 --> 14:20.945
Oh, is that her over there, by the tree?

14:21.195 --> 14:23.188
No, that doesn't look
anything like her, either.

14:23.189 --> 14:25.164
Do you just think all
white women look the same?

14:25.165 --> 14:25.828
No.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.525
I think all these white women
look the same.

14:28.526 --> 14:30.416
Just keep your eyes peeled.
Tell me if you see her.

14:30.417 --> 14:32.120
Well, I mean, that's going to be tough.

14:32.121 --> 14:35.245
At these speeds,
everything is just a blur.

14:35.246 --> 14:37.071
Shut up. I'm not used to these things.

14:37.072 --> 14:39.583
Not everyone grew up
going to country clubs.

14:39.739 --> 14:41.690
I feel like you just think of me as this

14:41.808 --> 14:44.179
like, spoiled rich kid
who spent all of his time

14:44.180 --> 14:45.524
playing tennis and golf.

14:45.827 --> 14:47.660
All right, well, what did
you grow up playing?

14:47.785 --> 14:50.116
- Mostly tennis and some golf.
- Uh...

14:50.117 --> 14:52.795
And I was a pretty decent skier.

14:52.796 --> 14:54.472
Ugh.

14:54.558 --> 14:56.305
Oh, wait, is that her over there?

14:56.555 --> 14:57.877
No, again, that's just...

14:58.572 --> 14:59.668
Oh, wait, yeah, no, that is her.

14:59.669 --> 15:01.901
Yeah, yeah, it is her. Okay, here we go.

15:03.135 --> 15:06.033
I'm going to take a nap.
Wake me up when we get there.

15:06.971 --> 15:09.459
Attention shoppers,
come buy your lottery ticket

15:09.460 --> 15:11.072
at customer service right now.

15:11.140 --> 15:13.727
There are some people who say
the lottery is basically a tax

15:13.728 --> 15:15.755
on lower income, less educated people.

15:15.756 --> 15:17.196
But you know who doesn't say that?

15:17.231 --> 15:19.790
People who win the lottery.

15:20.458 --> 15:22.726
There you go, got to
be in it to win it, girl.

15:24.238 --> 15:27.323
Myrtle, what are you doing here?

15:27.408 --> 15:30.376
- Playing the numbers.
- How you been?

15:30.411 --> 15:32.328
Oh, I've been doing just fine.

15:32.330 --> 15:36.318
I got a job collecting cans
and bottles from the trash.

15:37.051 --> 15:38.885
- Oh.
- It's not bad.

15:39.587 --> 15:41.351
There's some competition, but

15:41.609 --> 15:43.776
I just have to get there at 3:00 a.m.

15:44.091 --> 15:45.094
Yeah, wow.

15:45.805 --> 15:47.299
Hey, you know what? Um...

15:47.919 --> 15:50.832
why don't you give me these
and I'll give you the cash?

15:50.932 --> 15:52.287
Okay? Uh...

15:52.683 --> 15:54.804
$30 sounds about right for all of this.

15:54.805 --> 15:57.107
That's even more than I thought.

15:58.439 --> 16:00.768
- I hope you win.
- Me too.

16:01.108 --> 16:04.432
The nights at the motel
are starting to add up.

16:04.946 --> 16:06.508
Yeah.

16:07.485 --> 16:08.948
So we're just going to say

16:09.033 --> 16:10.449
that we happened to be here golfing,

16:10.534 --> 16:12.952
and that we ran into her,
and then I'll just segue

16:13.037 --> 16:14.954
- into talking about the raise.
- Got it.

16:15.039 --> 16:17.339
Do you want to go over
some possible segues?

16:17.425 --> 16:19.174
Uh, no, I think I'll just find it.

16:19.260 --> 16:21.282
Okay, all right, but
you know, just... just in case,

16:21.283 --> 16:23.095
uh, speaking of golf greens,

16:23.130 --> 16:25.166
I could use a little green myself.

16:25.466 --> 16:26.169
So dumb.

16:26.170 --> 16:28.336
You know what really tees me off?

16:28.337 --> 16:29.768
Low pay.

16:29.804 --> 16:32.361
Um, speaking of a hole-in-one...

16:33.630 --> 16:35.501
Oh, yeah, you're going to kill it.

16:36.312 --> 16:38.263
- Uh oh, she's moving.
- Laurie!

16:38.646 --> 16:40.758
Hey, Laurie! Laurie!

16:40.759 --> 16:42.573
Watch out for the hill right here.

16:42.854 --> 16:45.017
Hey! Hi, Laurie!

16:45.713 --> 16:47.113
I thought that was you.

16:47.114 --> 16:48.675
Oh, Amy, Amy, Amy. Watch out!

16:48.676 --> 16:50.463
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

16:52.983 --> 16:54.618
It doesn't seem like anything is broken,

16:54.619 --> 16:56.652
But just to be safe, I'm going
to need you not to move.

16:56.794 --> 16:58.528
Laurie, I am so sorry.

16:58.529 --> 17:00.001
I was trying to pull up next to you,

17:00.002 --> 17:02.291
but those things
really just don't turn well.

17:02.292 --> 17:04.199
And I'm not saying
this is what happened,

17:04.285 --> 17:07.169
but it is very possible that
someone cut my break lines.

17:07.253 --> 17:09.218
Okay. Can I get up please?

17:09.387 --> 17:10.169
I'm sorry for the wait.

17:10.170 --> 17:12.679
They don't let us
drive the truck on the grass.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.842
Well, while we're waiting,
and... and speaking of

17:21.935 --> 17:27.066
not being able to move,
I too have had trouble moving.

17:27.523 --> 17:29.929
Lately. Past the poverty line.

17:29.930 --> 17:31.508
No, no way, no, what are you doing?

17:31.509 --> 17:33.214
Chutzpah.

17:33.215 --> 17:37.445
So I would love... no,
actually, I think I deserve

17:37.701 --> 17:39.643
an extra buck 50 an hour.

17:39.644 --> 17:41.036
I'm sorry, are you actually

17:41.121 --> 17:42.331
asking me for a raise right now?

17:42.332 --> 17:44.206
- Of course not right now...
- Yes, yes.

17:44.208 --> 17:45.624
That is what I'm doing.

17:45.683 --> 17:47.432
Unless for some reason

17:47.434 --> 17:49.517
I'm not allowed to,
like, medically speaking.

17:49.570 --> 17:51.103
No, no, no, not medically.

17:51.315 --> 17:52.869
But if you're asking
me if it's a good idea

17:52.870 --> 17:54.252
right now to ask for a raise...

17:54.253 --> 17:55.654
No, I wasn't asking your opinion.

17:55.655 --> 17:57.266
- I just needed the info.
- Okay.

17:57.838 --> 18:00.885
With the highest
lottery jackpot in 20 years,

18:00.886 --> 18:02.892
tonight's winning numbers are:

18:03.501 --> 18:04.711
- 4...
- Nope.

18:05.624 --> 18:07.059
- 8...
- Nope.

18:07.815 --> 18:09.068
- 15...
- Nope.

18:09.069 --> 18:13.053
- Dina, we sold 12,742 tickets.
- Yes!

18:13.054 --> 18:15.570
Suck it, Colleen, you pink
ribbon wearing bitch.

18:15.656 --> 18:18.315
If her jaw wasn't wired shut,
I'd make her eat trash!

18:18.659 --> 18:21.026
So this was about
Colleen from Bel-Ridge.

18:21.078 --> 18:22.661
- Oh, yeah.
- Pretty sure I know the answer

18:22.696 --> 18:24.863
to this question, but, uh,
there's no bonus, is there?

18:24.915 --> 18:26.356
Just the bonus of telling
Colleen she can suck it...

18:26.357 --> 18:28.667
No, Sandra. You're not a part of this.

18:28.702 --> 18:31.392
And now, for our
mega jackpot winning number...

18:32.539 --> 18:36.091
42.

18:36.176 --> 18:37.865
It was the numbers from "Lost."

18:38.178 --> 18:40.045
Guess it's back
to washing my futon sheets

18:40.097 --> 18:41.301
like a frickin' nerd.

18:41.515 --> 18:43.156
I like working Thursdays.

18:43.550 --> 18:45.870
You can talk about
how Friday's coming up,

18:45.871 --> 18:49.604
and how Wednesday was, and, yeah.

18:49.690 --> 18:51.890
Enjoy your 5 1/2 million, loser.

18:53.394 --> 18:56.180
- I get seasick anyway.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:57.731 --> 19:00.555
I like living with my cousins.
It's... it's cool.

19:00.860 --> 19:02.617
In what world did you actually think

19:02.703 --> 19:04.364
she was going to give you a raise?

19:04.365 --> 19:05.424
I don't know.

19:06.073 --> 19:08.592
I thought she'd be like,
"You got moxie, kid."

19:10.911 --> 19:15.020
Why, because she's a 1930s
Hollywood producer?

19:15.021 --> 19:17.911
Yes, like, "I'm going to put
you in the pictures, see?"

19:19.386 --> 19:20.556
All right, Sosa up.

19:25.726 --> 19:29.358
This is a stupid game for stupid people.

19:29.359 --> 19:31.313
If you want to move up
the corporate ladder,

19:31.398 --> 19:33.565
you're going to need to
learn how to play golf.

19:33.600 --> 19:35.984
- Okay, golf camp.
- All right, just hear me out.

19:36.069 --> 19:38.320
Okay? So...

19:38.405 --> 19:40.272
So when you pull the club
back, you want to make

19:40.324 --> 19:43.191
- a triangle with your arms.
- Okay.

19:43.277 --> 19:45.494
Just think of yourself as,
like, you're a pendulum.

19:45.579 --> 19:47.329
Okay? You're a clock.

19:47.414 --> 19:50.031
Yeah, but not so loose,
and let's please be careful.

19:50.117 --> 19:51.376
Okay, so next...

19:52.462 --> 19:53.475
Do you, can I...

19:54.121 --> 19:55.491
- Put my arms around...
- Just do it, Jonah.

19:55.492 --> 19:56.588
It's only weird if you talk about it.

19:56.623 --> 19:58.589
Okay, all right.

19:58.590 --> 20:00.443
Okay, so, uh...

20:01.428 --> 20:03.595
- Hands overlap.
- Mm-hmm.

20:03.630 --> 20:07.215
Okay, um, back straight.

20:07.301 --> 20:10.685
Bend your knees. Okay, all right, good.

20:12.306 --> 20:14.806
Now, when you pull back,
good, good, good, good.

20:14.858 --> 20:18.894
- Hey, me again.
- Where are you?

20:18.979 --> 20:21.299
If you won the lottery
and are traveling the world,

20:21.306 --> 20:23.041
at least give me a call first, okay?

20:23.042 --> 20:24.608
So I can cancel our table.

20:26.153 --> 20:28.201
Okay. Bye.

20:28.622 --> 20:32.374
â™ª

20:32.466 --> 20:34.950
Good, good, okay, now don't swing yet.

20:34.951 --> 20:36.828
All right, when you come forward,

20:36.880 --> 20:39.998
we're going to move with
the power of our whole bodies.

20:40.067 --> 20:41.283
- Okay.
- Okay, not just our arms.

20:41.368 --> 20:43.568
And...

20:43.620 --> 20:45.070
â™ª

20:45.122 --> 20:47.239
Ah, yes!

20:47.298 --> 20:49.887
- I am so good!
- That was incredible.

20:49.888 --> 20:52.087
Who knew I would be so good at golf?

20:52.088 --> 20:53.828
- I certainly didn't.
- Whoo!

20:53.914 --> 20:55.247
- Yeah.
- Fore!

20:55.332 --> 20:57.465
No, no, no, no, not fore, nobody says...

20:57.551 --> 20:59.251
"Fore" is like a warning,
like you're going to,

20:59.303 --> 21:00.585
your ball is going to
hit somebody in the head.

21:00.637 --> 21:02.170
No, I'm pretty sure you say that

21:02.256 --> 21:03.421
whenever you feel like saying that.

21:03.473 --> 21:06.141
- That is incorrect.
- Fore!

21:06.226 --> 21:08.810
- It's fun, try it.
- Fore!

21:08.896 --> 21:10.812
- See?
- Yeah, that was really good.
