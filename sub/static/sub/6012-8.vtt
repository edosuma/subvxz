WEBVTT

00:34.486 --> 00:37.057
Take them straight
to the wagonette.

00:41.406 --> 00:43.475
The inventory, Mr Carson.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.558
Oh. Thank you.

00:52.127 --> 00:55.574
Mrs Hughes.
Oh. Thank you, Mr Barrow.

00:58.836 --> 01:00.912
How can we get it up to London?

01:00.913 --> 01:03.819
Don't worry. We'll have plenty
of time to make repairs.

01:03.820 --> 01:06.605
I must say, you're a real artist.

01:06.606 --> 01:09.012
Well, it's as much
Daisy's work as mine.

01:09.013 --> 01:13.324
Now, how much should we take and
what can we buy when we get there?

01:13.325 --> 01:15.910
I'm happy to tell you that
most things you can buy in Ripon

01:15.911 --> 01:18.325
are also available in London.

01:18.326 --> 01:20.181
But you don't trust them
quite the same.

01:20.182 --> 01:21.827
Well, YOU don't.

01:22.966 --> 01:26.453
Why is she coming to London?
Haven't they replaced Mrs Bute?

01:26.454 --> 01:28.405
Oh no, no, they're not going to.

01:28.406 --> 01:32.564
There'll be no permanent housekeeper
at Grantham House in future.

01:32.565 --> 01:34.923
Another clang in the march of time.

01:34.924 --> 01:38.325
- Ta dah!
- Oh, that's lovely.

01:38.326 --> 01:41.185
- You don't think it's a bit mumsy?
- No!

01:41.186 --> 01:44.908
It's very chic.
Can we see it with the hat?

01:52.127 --> 01:54.176
Are you looking forward to London?
I am.

01:54.177 --> 01:58.047
Mr Bates and I need to inspect our
house, so the timing couldn't be better.

01:58.048 --> 02:02.465
I'm sorry Susan's missing all this.
She doesn't care about clothes.

02:02.466 --> 02:05.772
I still don't understand why they
didn't come two months ago.

02:05.773 --> 02:09.615
The Government changed the date
for the hand-over. They were stuck.

02:09.616 --> 02:12.092
I'd have come back if it were
my daughter's wedding.

02:12.093 --> 02:14.535
I do not suggest a career
in the Diplomatic.

02:14.536 --> 02:16.773
- Will they be there before us?
- No.

02:16.774 --> 02:19.125
They're spending the night
in Southampton.

02:19.126 --> 02:21.496
We'll all arrive in St James's
on the same day.

02:21.497 --> 02:23.743
Are we to pretend
they're a happy couple?

02:23.744 --> 02:26.536
Yes, we jolly well are.
Why cast a shadow?

02:26.537 --> 02:29.135
I quite agree.
I'm sorry it can't be here.

02:29.136 --> 02:32.247
I don't think a registry office
wedding and a church blessing

02:32.248 --> 02:33.924
would be what the county expects,

02:33.925 --> 02:37.413
and London makes more sense
for Susan and Shrimpie.

02:37.414 --> 02:41.457
And I want a blessing in a synagogue.
Would you find a synagogue in Ripon?

02:41.458 --> 02:44.454
I do admire the way you just
take it all in your stride.

02:44.455 --> 02:46.847
It would make it easier
for Lord Sinderby.

02:46.848 --> 02:49.942
Oh, I'm not sure Lord Sinderby
deserves your concern.

02:49.943 --> 02:52.915
Atticus loves him and I love Atticus.

02:52.916 --> 02:57.103
Love may not conquer all,
but it can conquer quite a lot.

02:59.196 --> 03:02.135
I worried about her ladyship
having to face the traitor,

03:02.136 --> 03:06.348
but Miss O'Brien's got herself
taken on by the new Governor's wife.

03:06.349 --> 03:10.555
Typical, but I've been told
they've neither maid nor valet,

03:10.556 --> 03:13.574
which seems odd for
a Marquess and Marchioness.

03:13.575 --> 03:17.814
I don't think they have two pennies
to rub together. It's all gone.

03:17.815 --> 03:20.777
So, the Sinderby millions
must be a cheering thought.

03:20.778 --> 03:25.181
I wonder. Lady Flintshire's not
the most liberal being on the planet.

03:25.182 --> 03:26.645
No.
Then again...

03:26.646 --> 03:30.885
Madge says Lord Sinderby's
none too keen. So I gather.

03:30.886 --> 03:33.535
Hurrah for intolerance on both sides.

03:33.536 --> 03:36.826
I'm worried about running it with
only Messrs Barrow and Molesley.

03:36.827 --> 03:39.820
You think we'll look a bit dingy?
Don't you?

03:39.821 --> 03:43.325
Could we borrow a spare footman?
I don't know.

03:43.326 --> 03:46.261
Borrowing footmen sounds like
something out of the last century.

03:46.262 --> 03:47.965
Even to me!

03:47.966 --> 03:50.549
Hire a lad for the week.
It wouldn't cost much.

03:50.550 --> 03:55.735
That's to be it for the Big Parade?
The Big Parade's passed, Mr Carson.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.148
We're just trying to keep up
as best we can.

03:59.406 --> 04:00.862
My turn.

04:04.806 --> 04:06.297
What would my father say?

04:06.298 --> 04:10.204
That you were building a very solid
friendship with your granddaughter.

04:10.205 --> 04:14.394
No, darling. You've landed on a snake
so you have to go back to there.

04:14.395 --> 04:15.805
No!

04:15.806 --> 04:18.053
Don't be so mean.
Let her stay where she is.

04:18.053 --> 04:21.778
It won't be very helpful later on
if we don't teach her how to lose.

04:21.779 --> 04:23.555
Go ahead and cry, darling.

04:23.556 --> 04:26.655
Make Donk feel guilty.
Don't call me Donk!

04:26.656 --> 04:29.246
Oh hurry up, Donk!
It's your turn.

04:29.247 --> 04:33.745
What's that?
It's from my cousin in Boston.

04:33.746 --> 04:37.353
He sells cars but he wants
to expand into farm machinery.

04:37.354 --> 04:39.555
Well, you know about both.

04:39.556 --> 04:41.734
Exactly. He'd like me
to come in with him.

04:41.735 --> 04:44.184
Oh, is he opening a branch over here?

04:44.185 --> 04:47.735
No. He's asked me to join him
in Massachusetts.

04:47.736 --> 04:50.965
As a partner.
Oh, I see.

04:50.966 --> 04:55.695
How's Lord Sinderby? I think
he dreams of my changing my mind.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.533
You'd think with a father like that

04:57.534 --> 04:59.688
Atticus would have
a more Jewish name.

04:59.689 --> 05:02.246
His real name is Ephraim Atticus,

05:02.247 --> 05:05.023
but his mother called him Atticus
as a baby and it stuck.

05:05.024 --> 05:06.475
She's your ally.

05:06.476 --> 05:09.766
Yes, but not because she thinks
it's all unimportant,

05:09.767 --> 05:12.782
just that she thinks her son's
happiness is more important.

05:12.783 --> 05:14.095
Thank you!

05:14.096 --> 05:16.295
I like the sound of that.

05:16.296 --> 05:20.246
Mr and Mrs Bates. Might I take up
a moment of your time?

05:20.247 --> 05:23.175
I had a call earlier
from Sergeant Willis.

05:23.176 --> 05:26.173
Mr Vyner is back up here and
wants to come by in the morning.

05:26.174 --> 05:28.225
To see me.
To see both of you.

05:29.976 --> 05:31.573
I don't understand. Why?

05:31.574 --> 05:34.035
I dare say it will become clearer
after he's been.

05:34.036 --> 05:36.045
We hoped this was over.

05:36.046 --> 05:38.902
So did I, Mr Bates. So did I.

05:40.000 --> 05:46.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:48.326 --> 05:50.126
I'm going up.

05:50.127 --> 05:51.765
Good night.

05:51.766 --> 05:54.849
I'll check on the children
so you don't have to.

05:57.326 --> 05:59.254
She's keen. I'll give her that.

05:59.255 --> 06:02.058
Why does she have to carry on
as if she'd invented motherhood?

06:02.059 --> 06:03.383
I'm going to bed, too.

06:03.384 --> 06:06.257
Before you do, have you thought
about the work in the village?

06:06.258 --> 06:09.776
Those cottages are in quite a state
and we ought to get on with it.

06:09.777 --> 06:13.056
I know, I know, but how are we
going to find the money?

06:13.057 --> 06:16.220
Let's think about it while we're
in London and make a decision.

06:25.846 --> 06:28.907
Is it true that London Inspector
is coming back tomorrow?

06:28.908 --> 06:30.193
How do you know that?

06:33.127 --> 06:38.295
Just remember I'd be happy to swear
I saw that ticket in one piece.

06:38.296 --> 06:41.391
Her ladyship's on her way to bed.
Right. Thank you.

06:47.955 --> 06:51.175
I hope Miss Baxter's not all
we've got between us and trouble.

06:53.425 --> 06:57.183
I want to use London this time
because I always resolve

06:57.184 --> 07:00.237
to visit theatres and
galleries and museums.

07:00.238 --> 07:02.888
Then I get home
and I've not done anything.

07:02.889 --> 07:04.115
I'll join you.

07:05.555 --> 07:09.235
We'll go together.
I'll hold you to that.

07:09.236 --> 07:13.508
Ah. The date of the unveiling.
Of the memorial? When is it?

07:13.509 --> 07:16.712
On the 25th, so we'll just
be back from the wedding.

07:16.713 --> 07:19.663
Everyone, we will be unveiling
the war memorial in the village

07:19.664 --> 07:21.504
at twelve noon on the 25th.

07:21.505 --> 07:23.485
I'd like the house
to be well represented.

07:24.825 --> 07:27.283
I hope you won't object
if I don't come, Mr Carson.

07:27.284 --> 07:30.714
Oh? You'd be missed.

07:30.715 --> 07:34.874
I don't want to drag it up again,
but it would be painful.

07:34.875 --> 07:37.345
Mr Carson understands.

07:37.346 --> 07:38.654
Yes, that's as may be.

07:39.755 --> 07:41.274
Poor woman.

07:41.275 --> 07:44.358
You heard her.
Let's not drag it up again.

07:48.305 --> 07:52.304
Have you quite finished, m'lady?
Yes, thank you, Denker.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.924
Who was that at the door?

07:53.925 --> 07:56.373
A gentleman called
Prince Kuragin, m'lady.

07:56.374 --> 07:58.245
He's in the drawing room.

07:59.385 --> 08:02.298
I told him you weren't downstairs
but he said he'd wait.

08:02.299 --> 08:04.584
He was most insistent.
Yes I...

08:04.585 --> 08:08.374
I don't think I'll wear
what I chose last night.

08:08.375 --> 08:12.006
I suspected that might be the case
so I put out the lavender day dress.

08:12.007 --> 08:14.293
Goes very well with
your ladyship's colouring.

08:14.294 --> 08:17.994
The Prince is an old friend, Denker,
nothing more.

08:17.995 --> 08:22.011
Oh, I'm sure, m'lady, but it never
hurts to look your best, does it?

08:22.012 --> 08:24.089
No. I don't believe it does.

08:28.995 --> 08:33.784
We'll need representatives of
the regiments involved and a band,

08:33.784 --> 08:36.038
but I dare say
that's all under control.

08:36.039 --> 08:38.174
I dare say it is, m'lord.

08:40.106 --> 08:43.922
Oh, I'd like William Mason's father
to have a good place.

08:43.923 --> 08:47.397
William left this house
to give his life for his country.

08:47.398 --> 08:50.674
I feel that very deeply.
We all do, m'lord.

08:50.675 --> 08:53.161
Will you tell the staff?
Already done.

08:53.162 --> 08:55.035
We should have a good turnout.

08:55.036 --> 08:58.757
Mrs Patmore has asked to be excused
but that's understandable.

08:58.758 --> 09:00.784
I'm sorry, but not surprised.

09:00.785 --> 09:02.128
M'lord.

09:04.435 --> 09:08.554
I don't know what you mean by
"our last chance".

09:08.555 --> 09:12.914
We left any chance we had behind us,
many years ago.

09:12.915 --> 09:15.805
I don't accept that.
And what about the Princess?

09:15.806 --> 09:18.314
They haven't found her yet.

09:18.315 --> 09:21.274
We've been apart
for a long time.

09:21.275 --> 09:24.225
Are you proposing to divorce?

09:24.226 --> 09:26.046
Why? Do you want more children?

09:27.745 --> 09:30.294
I wish to spend
my final years with you.

09:33.515 --> 09:35.944
As a friend, as a lover.

09:35.945 --> 09:40.041
I don't seek scandal, only love.

09:41.645 --> 09:44.394
The last years have been ugly.

09:44.395 --> 09:46.409
I don't want what remains
to be ugly.

09:46.410 --> 09:48.225
No.

09:48.226 --> 09:50.046
So...

09:51.195 --> 09:52.634
...what do you say?

09:52.635 --> 09:58.504
You want an answer just like that?
I know my own feelings. You do too.

09:58.505 --> 10:01.372
I can't make a decision now!

10:02.195 --> 10:04.365
I won't change.

10:04.366 --> 10:09.679
Don't proclaim your intransigence
as if it were a virtue.

10:13.595 --> 10:15.994
Things have advanced a little.

10:15.995 --> 10:19.807
It seems Mr Green was not quite the
sunny soul that Mr Carson depicted.

10:19.808 --> 10:24.794
He appears to have carried out
a series of attacks on women.

10:24.795 --> 10:27.595
They were too nervous
to come forward before now,

10:27.596 --> 10:30.854
but with a little encouragement
some of them have spoken out.

10:30.855 --> 10:32.756
We've formed a picture
of his behaviour.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.914
But nothing happened here!

10:34.915 --> 10:38.204
His victims were generally
small, slight women,

10:38.205 --> 10:40.095
who'd given little or no
encouragement.

10:40.096 --> 10:43.111
How very unpleasant.
It is rather 'unpleasant'.

10:43.112 --> 10:46.704
Wouldn't you agree, Mrs Bates?
Yes.

10:46.705 --> 10:49.481
We also have news which may put
Mr Bates in the clear.

10:49.482 --> 10:52.304
A second witness has come forward.

10:52.305 --> 10:55.936
His evidence suggests whoever was
arguing with Green on the pavement

10:55.937 --> 10:57.326
was shorter than him.

10:57.327 --> 10:59.391
Shorter than yourself, Mr Bates.

10:59.392 --> 11:02.389
What do you think, Mrs Hughes?
I don't know a thing about it.

11:08.025 --> 11:10.107
We'll leave it there.

11:11.385 --> 11:15.574
If we need Mrs Bates to come
to London, could that be arranged?

11:15.575 --> 11:18.366
We'll be in London next week
for Lady Rose's wedding.

11:18.367 --> 11:22.034
Could you pop in to Scotland Yard
on Tuesday at ten o'clock?

11:22.035 --> 11:25.802
If she comes, I'll be with her.
As you wish. Now I'll say goodbye.

11:29.035 --> 11:31.754
What on earth was that about?

11:31.755 --> 11:34.024
He's trying to bully it out,

11:34.025 --> 11:36.255
but it's best not to
stand in his way.

11:40.075 --> 11:42.100
Bully what out?

11:43.305 --> 11:45.455
You're required upstairs, Mr Carson.

11:52.256 --> 11:56.906
Mr Evans. It's good of you to come.
I'm pleased to, m'lord.

11:56.907 --> 12:00.074
Your father carved many stones
for our dogs over the years.

12:00.075 --> 12:02.074
I'm glad you're prepared
to go on with it.

12:02.075 --> 12:04.808
These are like the ones
we've made for you in the past.

12:04.809 --> 12:09.445
Is this a book of pets' tombstones?
A parallel universe.

12:09.446 --> 12:12.643
No, m'lord.
You've examples of everything we do.

12:12.644 --> 12:16.165
Oh, I see. What's this?

12:16.166 --> 12:18.055
A memorial, m'lord.

12:18.056 --> 12:22.527
We made it for a garden in Hinckley.
Near Leicester? You do get about.

12:27.136 --> 12:30.345
There you are! You took your time.

12:30.346 --> 12:32.885
I thought you'd rung by accident.

12:32.886 --> 12:36.174
How would you like to be summoned,
by Joshua's trumpet?

12:36.175 --> 12:38.895
I prefer not to be
"summoned" at all.

12:38.896 --> 12:40.386
At any rate, not by you.

12:40.387 --> 12:42.935
Take these down to the car.

12:42.936 --> 12:45.359
I'm going to fetch her
galoshes and umbrella.

12:59.266 --> 13:01.705
I've been thinking.

13:01.706 --> 13:05.102
Should I tell them everything when
we get there and have done with it?

13:05.103 --> 13:08.796
No. I'm not one to give up
my secrets unless I have to.

13:08.797 --> 13:11.869
They have nothing if the man
who killed him can't have been you.

13:11.870 --> 13:13.376
Even so.

13:13.377 --> 13:14.905
Daisy?

13:14.906 --> 13:16.425
Yes, Mr Carson.

13:16.426 --> 13:21.506
Before we go, his lordship wants
to extend an invitation to Mr Mason

13:21.507 --> 13:24.913
for the unveiling, which will
include you as William's widow.

13:24.914 --> 13:27.265
Thank you, Mr Carson.
I'll write to him as Chairman.

13:27.266 --> 13:29.998
It might be nice if you were to
mention it in your next letter.

13:29.999 --> 13:31.785
Of course.
Right.

13:31.786 --> 13:34.005
Well, we'd better
get up to the cars.

13:35.377 --> 13:39.103
I hope you can manage a few days
without Denker, Spratt.

13:39.104 --> 13:42.111
A hope that will be fulfilled
and gladly, m'lady.

13:42.112 --> 13:44.655
Are these all the cases, Denker?

13:44.656 --> 13:47.496
Your ladyship is very sharp-eyed.

13:47.497 --> 13:48.919
We are missing one.

13:50.786 --> 13:53.953
Since Mr Spratt was given the task
of bringing them down,

13:53.954 --> 13:56.438
no doubt he's put it somewhere
for safe keeping.

13:56.439 --> 13:59.925
Oh, how very considerate of you,
Spratt.

13:59.926 --> 14:03.093
Fetch it now, please.
But your ladyship, I don't...

14:03.094 --> 14:04.383
Fetch the case, Spratt.

14:21.888 --> 14:25.167
I feel so guilty,
leaving Marigold on her own.

14:25.168 --> 14:28.437
Oh, she's surrounded
by nannies and children!

14:28.438 --> 14:30.497
I know.
She'll have a whale of a time.

14:34.808 --> 14:37.967
Edith is obsessed with that child.

14:37.968 --> 14:40.557
She's a dear little thing.
So she is.

14:40.558 --> 14:43.789
But as a matter of fact,
there is something about her.

14:43.790 --> 14:48.358
About Marigold? What?
I don't know. A sense of deja vu.

14:48.359 --> 14:50.623
I can't quite put my finger on it.

15:17.328 --> 15:22.327
All of you, Andy will be an extra
footman while we're in London.

15:22.328 --> 15:24.557
Please be helpful to him.

15:24.558 --> 15:26.634
Starting at dinner tonight?
That's the idea.

15:26.635 --> 15:29.199
How did Mr Carson find you?
I was working as a hall boy.

15:29.200 --> 15:31.197
Mr Carson rang my old butler.

15:31.198 --> 15:33.434
It's only a week's work.
Will he take you back?

15:33.435 --> 15:35.206
I don't want to go back
as a hall boy.

15:35.207 --> 15:37.849
I want to be a footman now
and this is the first step.

15:37.850 --> 15:40.968
I think that's brave.
You've got to be brave these days.

15:40.969 --> 15:44.542
Do you know London well?
Not here. I grew up in the East End.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.997
I've only ever worked in Bayswater.
Bayswater?

15:47.998 --> 15:50.911
North of the park.
Oh yes, I know where it is.

15:50.912 --> 15:53.837
So you're not known round here then?
No.

15:53.838 --> 15:55.936
You're just with us
'til after the wedding?

15:55.937 --> 15:58.845
That's it.
I dare say you enjoy a bit of fun.

15:58.846 --> 16:00.728
I s'pose so.
As much as the next man.

16:00.729 --> 16:03.631
There's fun to be had round here
if you know where to look for it.

16:03.632 --> 16:07.167
You know this area, then?
Oh, yes. I've come home.

16:07.168 --> 16:09.618
I spent many a year
in St James's Square.

16:09.619 --> 16:12.696
Before we get drawn into
Miss Denker's past adventures,

16:12.697 --> 16:15.692
why don't you come with me and
I'll show you how it all works?

16:15.693 --> 16:16.930
Chop, chop.

16:19.408 --> 16:22.927
Welcome the hunter,
home from the hill.

16:22.928 --> 16:25.147
How are you both?
Worn out!

16:25.148 --> 16:26.559
The train from Southampton

16:26.560 --> 16:28.486
was almost as bad as
the voyage from Bombay.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.367
You must lie down before you change.

16:31.619 --> 16:33.618
Do you remember Carson?

16:33.619 --> 16:36.919
I gather you haven't brought
any personal attendants, m'lord.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.286
Those days are done for us.
We needn't tell the world.

16:40.728 --> 16:44.290
You will have Lady Mary's maid Anna,
to help you, m'lady.

16:44.291 --> 16:48.033
His lordship will have Mr Molesley.
Now I'll show you to your room.

16:48.034 --> 16:50.837
We're not in one room? Together?

16:50.838 --> 16:54.797
The thing is, we're very squashed.
I'm not sharing a room.

16:54.798 --> 16:57.147
I'll go to an hotel.
Come on...

16:57.148 --> 17:00.800
Don't worry m'lady, we'll manage.
If you'd like to come this way.

17:06.147 --> 17:08.480
Maybe Lady Rose
could share with Lady Edith?

17:08.481 --> 17:10.310
Thank you, Mrs Hughes.

17:13.478 --> 17:15.753
I knew she'd be trouble.

17:18.058 --> 17:19.837
Mummy.

17:19.838 --> 17:22.276
They said you'd arrived.
Yes. What a journey.

17:22.277 --> 17:25.010
I seem to have been travelling
for as long as I can remember.

17:25.011 --> 17:26.787
Well, you're here now.

17:26.788 --> 17:29.234
Won't you give your
poor old mother a kiss?

17:29.235 --> 17:30.526
Of course.

17:34.858 --> 17:38.116
This is quite a choice you've made.
I hope you'll like him.

17:38.117 --> 17:40.167
They're all coming
for dinner tonight.

17:40.168 --> 17:43.391
And you're quite, quite sure?

17:45.108 --> 17:46.477
Absolutely.

17:46.478 --> 17:48.446
Well then,
that's all I needed to hear.

17:50.338 --> 17:54.075
Has Mr Carson announced dinner?
They're not all here yet.

17:54.076 --> 17:56.746
I found a letter from Mr Vyner
when we arrived,

17:56.747 --> 17:59.357
confirming I'm to be at
Scotland Yard in the morning.

17:59.358 --> 18:01.032
Try not to worry about it.

18:01.033 --> 18:05.046
Why not go to see your house
afterwards? You'd enjoy that.

18:07.198 --> 18:09.297
Now, in London, we supervise,

18:09.298 --> 18:12.439
but they help themselves to coffee
and drinks from a side table.

18:12.440 --> 18:14.228
Once they settle,
we leave them to it.

18:14.229 --> 18:16.874
In my last place, the footmen
stayed 'til they went to bed.

18:16.875 --> 18:18.848
If they want a second drink,
it's up to them.

18:20.138 --> 18:21.357
There we are.

18:21.358 --> 18:24.017
I hope Anna was helpful.

18:24.018 --> 18:26.117
She will be, I'm sure.

18:26.118 --> 18:28.937
Where are the Sinderbys?

18:28.938 --> 18:32.010
Oh?! We thought you might be
Lord and Lady Sinderby.

18:32.838 --> 18:34.947
'Fraid not.

18:34.948 --> 18:36.057
Hello.

18:36.058 --> 18:39.486
What are they like?
She's very nice and fond of Rose.

18:39.487 --> 18:43.156
He's less convinced.
Rose is more than a match for him.

18:43.157 --> 18:45.879
It does make me smile that they
should be the ones objecting.

18:45.880 --> 18:48.317
They have as much right as we do.
Mummy, Daddy...

18:48.318 --> 18:50.518
Can you try to behave
like a happy couple?

18:50.519 --> 18:53.559
Wouldn't that be rather dishonest?
You haven't separated yet.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.636
We separated the moment we walked
down the gangway at Southampton.

18:56.637 --> 18:59.906
It won't kill us to put on a show
for a few more days.

18:59.907 --> 19:04.407
The thing is, I don't want to give
Lord Sinderby any ammunition.

19:04.408 --> 19:07.358
So, Lady Rose MacClare
is a mesalliance.

19:07.359 --> 19:09.509
I'm not sure that's helpful, Granny.

19:11.328 --> 19:14.309
Lord and Lady Sinderby
and Mr Atticus Aldridge.

19:14.310 --> 19:16.655
Do come in. How lovely to see you.

19:19.178 --> 19:22.257
Daddy, Mummy. This is Atticus.

19:22.258 --> 19:25.068
How do you do?
What a peculiar name.

19:30.978 --> 19:33.457
How's it going?

19:33.458 --> 19:37.407
Lady Flintshire is not a push-over.
I told you that.

19:37.408 --> 19:41.478
I must ask, because I can't
get it out of my mind,

19:41.479 --> 19:44.119
why has the Inspector
summoned Mrs Bates?

19:44.120 --> 19:49.767
Would it help if I swore neither
of them has done anything wrong?

19:49.768 --> 19:53.917
I never doubted it,
but it's a relief to hear.

19:53.918 --> 19:56.897
I'd better go up.

19:56.898 --> 20:00.055
What made you choose Yorkshire?
Was it a historic reason?

20:00.056 --> 20:03.951
Not really. I used to go there as
a girl and of course it's beautiful.

20:03.952 --> 20:06.107
Do you have any English blood?

20:06.108 --> 20:08.047
We only date from the 1850s,

20:08.048 --> 20:11.535
but Lady Sinderby's family arrived
in the reign of King Richard Ill.

20:11.536 --> 20:15.579
Really? I think of you as nomads,
drifting around the world.

20:15.580 --> 20:19.311
Talking of drifting round, is it true
you're starting your honeymoon

20:19.312 --> 20:21.359
at the Melfords' in Coningsby?

20:21.360 --> 20:23.316
Oh yes.
Lady Melford is Mother's cousin.

20:23.317 --> 20:25.758
Is she? I never knew that.

20:25.759 --> 20:29.651
You wanted a synagogue blessing?
I'd like to respect both sides.

20:29.652 --> 20:32.929
You don't understand our customs.
Then again, why should you?

20:32.930 --> 20:36.604
So it won't be possible?
No. He should have told you.

20:36.605 --> 20:40.557
I thought we could have
a dinner on Wednesday night

20:40.558 --> 20:43.378
so you could meet
some of the relations.

20:43.379 --> 20:45.917
And show them how lucky they are!

20:45.918 --> 20:48.995
Have you got many staying?
We're crammed to the gunwales.

20:48.996 --> 20:51.127
Atticus has had to move
into the Halnaby Hotel.

20:51.128 --> 20:52.477
I love the Halnaby.

20:52.478 --> 20:55.493
It makes sense and he can have
his... What do they call it now?

20:55.494 --> 20:59.837
His stag party there,
without disturbing us.

20:59.838 --> 21:02.516
- Will you be going, Lord Sinderby?
- Hardly.

21:02.517 --> 21:05.137
Stag parties are high on
Father's disapproval list.

21:05.138 --> 21:09.717
Is it a long list, Lord Sinderby,
the things you disapprove of?

21:09.718 --> 21:14.246
No, as long as I can steer clear
of card sharps and undercooked fish,

21:14.247 --> 21:17.787
and divorce,
I think I'm fairly easy.

21:17.788 --> 21:21.419
Is divorce so terrible? Is it worse
to stay together and be miserable?

21:21.420 --> 21:25.220
I am clearly old-fashioned but to me
divorce signifies weakness.

21:25.221 --> 21:29.397
Degradation, scandal and failure.

21:29.398 --> 21:33.323
Are you glad to be in London again?
I will be when I get the house back.

21:33.324 --> 21:36.628
When do the tenants go?
Next week in theory.

21:36.629 --> 21:40.133
I need to pull the real pictures
out of storage. What a palaver!

21:40.134 --> 21:42.307
I know, but think of the relief

21:42.308 --> 21:46.157
when I can shut the door at last
and be alone in my own home.

21:46.158 --> 21:49.493
Won't Lord Flintshire be with you?
Of course he will.

21:49.494 --> 21:53.307
Of course I will.
What a funny thing to say, Susan.

21:53.308 --> 21:55.277
Funny is one word for it.

21:55.278 --> 21:59.010
Well, I want you to know that you'll
always be welcome at Canningford.

21:59.011 --> 22:00.397
How kind.

22:00.398 --> 22:03.504
Tell me, do you find it difficult
these days to get staff?

22:04.759 --> 22:06.667
Not very.

22:06.668 --> 22:09.126
But then we're Jewish,
so we pay well.

22:16.118 --> 22:19.361
If I don't get an early night,
I'll never make it through the week.

22:20.918 --> 22:23.330
Is Dicky Merton coming
to the wedding?

22:23.331 --> 22:25.197
I don't think so.

22:25.198 --> 22:27.557
Oh, oh I'm sorry.

22:27.558 --> 22:30.127
You've changed your tune.

22:30.128 --> 22:34.497
I've been reminded recently that one
is not given many chances in life

22:34.498 --> 22:37.477
and if you miss them,

22:37.478 --> 22:40.607
they may not necessarily be repeated.

22:43.658 --> 22:47.557
Sinderby's as stiff as a board.
What more can I do?

22:47.558 --> 22:52.477
May I ask, do you two worry about
Sybbie and George when you're away?

22:52.478 --> 22:54.107
Why should we?

22:54.108 --> 22:57.489
No reason, but I think about
Marigold all the time.

22:57.490 --> 23:00.050
What are you going to be like
when you have your own?

23:00.051 --> 23:02.285
I intend to leave it all to Nanny.
You say that.

23:02.286 --> 23:05.264
I'm used to the way the children
live at Downton, but it seems odd.

23:05.265 --> 23:08.705
Will it be different in America?
He isn't going and that's flat.

23:08.706 --> 23:10.057
Mary...
Stop!

23:10.058 --> 23:12.656
This is my wedding
and I'm not having it spoiled.

23:12.657 --> 23:14.619
Quite right. I tell you what.

23:14.620 --> 23:17.750
Why don't the four of us go for
lunch on Wednesday? Even you, Edith.

23:17.751 --> 23:21.029
To mark Rose's last days of freedom
and the end of an era.

23:21.030 --> 23:22.474
Let's go to Rules. My treat.

23:22.475 --> 23:25.127
Yes.
Why not?

23:25.128 --> 23:27.875
Sinderby's going to be
quite a challenge for Rose.

23:27.933 --> 23:29.098
No doubt about that.

23:29.118 --> 23:32.133
And what possessed Susan?
"Do you have any English blood?"

23:32.134 --> 23:34.677
Really!
She speaks without thinking.

23:34.678 --> 23:38.607
Did you know Bates and Anna are going
to Scotland Yard tomorrow morning?

23:38.608 --> 23:42.287
Certainly not! Why?
Bates didn't really give a reason.

23:42.288 --> 23:46.772
Do they want character testimonials?
I offered, but he said no. Not yet.

23:51.039 --> 23:55.831
The stone mason has sent his bill.
Is Mrs Patmore downstairs?

23:55.848 --> 23:58.207
I believe so, m'lord.

23:58.208 --> 24:01.288
And is Bates back?
Not yet, m'lord.

24:01.289 --> 24:03.223
A strange business, Carson.

24:04.368 --> 24:07.607
Can I help?
I'm trying to find the letter box.

24:07.608 --> 24:09.861
It's through there,
but the post may have gone.

24:09.862 --> 24:12.007
Is it crucial?
A bit crucial.

24:12.008 --> 24:15.085
I hate saying, "the cheque's
in the post" when it isn't.

24:15.086 --> 24:16.979
I'll walk up to Jermyn Street.

24:16.980 --> 24:19.885
Here's Carson. ls Lady Flintshire
too late to give you a letter?

24:19.886 --> 24:22.063
No, m'lord. I'm collecting them now.

24:22.064 --> 24:24.647
Thank you, Carson.

24:24.648 --> 24:27.517
Miss Baxter and Mr Molesley
have asked me

24:27.518 --> 24:30.090
to see the Wallace Collection
with them tomorrow.

24:30.091 --> 24:33.267
Daisy, the wedding is on Friday!
That's what I said.

24:33.268 --> 24:36.138
But, it's only Tuesday now
and we've done most of it

24:36.139 --> 24:38.577
apart from the stuff
we can't do before the day.

24:38.578 --> 24:42.141
I don't know. Is this a kitchen
or a holiday resort?

24:42.142 --> 24:43.927
Oh, go but...

24:43.928 --> 24:46.465
If you're not back by teatime,
I'll call the police.

24:47.578 --> 24:48.887
Oh, my God!

24:48.888 --> 24:51.805
I do apologise for interrupting
your work, Mrs Patmore.

24:51.806 --> 24:54.733
That's quite all right, m'lord.
I'm afraid I'm a bit of a mess.

24:54.734 --> 24:56.697
Not at all, please.

24:56.698 --> 25:00.617
I just wanted to ask you
if you might reconsider

25:00.618 --> 25:02.746
coming to the unveiling
of the memorial.

25:02.747 --> 25:06.617
I don't mean to be rude, m'lord...
I know that.

25:06.618 --> 25:09.855
But, it's important reconciliation
is the spirit of the day.

25:09.856 --> 25:13.625
I should feel I had failed if you
were to be absent from the ceremony.

25:13.626 --> 25:16.637
Please. I ask it as a favour.

25:16.638 --> 25:19.152
Very well. If it means that much
to your lordship.

25:19.153 --> 25:21.379
It does. Thank you.

25:35.758 --> 25:38.494
If you'll come this way, Mrs Bates.
I'm staying with her.

25:38.495 --> 25:40.434
Suit yourself.
Through here please.

25:45.768 --> 25:48.047
Take your place in the line.

25:48.048 --> 25:51.357
But why? What have I done?
This is madness.

25:51.358 --> 25:53.133
Come along.

26:01.618 --> 26:03.268
Hold the cards in front of you.

26:36.208 --> 26:38.540
Thank you very much.
You may go.

26:43.718 --> 26:45.418
What is this about?

26:45.419 --> 26:48.017
She had nothing to do with it.
You know that!

26:48.018 --> 26:51.495
Calm yourself. You must be aware that
most of this stuff is just routine?

26:51.496 --> 26:53.628
So we can cross people off our lists.

26:53.629 --> 26:56.988
Let's go. We have some business
to attend to, while we're here.

26:56.989 --> 26:59.094
You'll want to get on with it, then.

27:04.008 --> 27:06.487
Have you got the hang of it now?

27:06.488 --> 27:09.336
I think so. Dinner's done and dusted
without incident.

27:09.337 --> 27:12.027
I'll take you for a walk later,
show you the sights.

27:12.028 --> 27:15.377
What about Lady Grantham?
She'll be in bed before then.

27:15.378 --> 27:18.104
Would you mind taking the coffee up
while it's still hot?

27:18.105 --> 27:19.714
Or is that too much to ask?

27:24.539 --> 27:28.148
I hope you're not planning to
lead him into bad ways, Miss Denker.

27:28.149 --> 27:30.505
No. Andy isn't a country lad, is he?

27:30.506 --> 27:34.408
I expect he knows his way around
better than I do.

27:34.409 --> 27:35.967
I doubt that.

27:35.968 --> 27:38.295
She's got a plan in mind, that one,

27:38.296 --> 27:40.587
a plan to her own advantage
and I'd like to know...

27:41.798 --> 27:45.632
Daisy? Are you listening?
London's full of possibilities.

27:45.633 --> 27:48.337
Life's full of possibilities.

27:48.338 --> 27:52.900
Really? Sometimes I think my life
has no possibilities at all.

27:54.539 --> 27:56.727
Where's Aunt Violet?

27:56.728 --> 28:01.288
MY Aunt Violet has gone up.
So has Mrs Crawley.

28:01.289 --> 28:05.567
And Atticus?
Where is the lovelorn swain tonight?

28:05.568 --> 28:09.232
Don't you remember?
He's got his bachelor party.

28:11.808 --> 28:14.736
Do you like him, Daddy?
Please say you do.

28:14.737 --> 28:17.327
Certainly I do. Very much.

28:17.328 --> 28:19.085
Did you get to Bond Street?

28:19.086 --> 28:22.096
The chap I need to see was busy.
I'm going tomorrow afternoon.

28:22.097 --> 28:24.819
Please don't make us late for
Lady Sinderby's dinner.

28:24.820 --> 28:28.497
What are you doing in Bond Street?
It's an idea I've had, that's all.

28:28.498 --> 28:30.559
An idea he is clearly
not going to share with us.

28:33.808 --> 28:35.347
That's it. I'm going to bed.

28:35.348 --> 28:38.501
You said we'd have one more drink
and I've had one more.

28:38.502 --> 28:40.354
So now I'm off to bed.

28:41.718 --> 28:45.461
You can stay as long as you want.
Put it on my bill.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.140
Champagne!

29:01.539 --> 29:03.087
No, not tonight.

29:03.088 --> 29:06.194
I'm sorry if I misled you,
but it's not going to happen.

29:14.688 --> 29:16.361
- Who is it?
- Your tea, sir.

29:17.698 --> 29:19.029
But I didn't order any tea.

29:20.828 --> 29:22.023
What on earth?

29:23.448 --> 29:27.538
Is this a joke?
Did Mr Ryecart pay you to come up?

29:27.539 --> 29:31.177
Just wait, one moment...

29:31.178 --> 29:32.714
Bye.

29:41.898 --> 29:44.567
Andy? How was last night?

29:44.568 --> 29:46.718
Did you go for your walk
with Miss Denker?

29:46.719 --> 29:50.145
Yes, I bloody well did,
the more fool me.

29:52.128 --> 29:56.440
Is everything all right, Mr Barrow?
Just fine, Mrs Hughes, thank you.

30:00.088 --> 30:03.617
Michael and I had luncheon here
on our very first date.

30:03.618 --> 30:07.636
One day you'll be glad to think
of the times you spent together.

30:07.637 --> 30:12.021
You're the only member of the family
that seems to understand.

30:12.448 --> 30:14.007
Sorry we're late.

30:14.008 --> 30:15.670
How did you get on?
So well!

30:15.671 --> 30:18.946
If I show you, the women here
will be too jealous to eat.

30:18.947 --> 30:22.127
Oh. Er, this came for you
by messenger.

30:22.128 --> 30:24.734
Carson asked me give it to you.
Thank you.

30:27.008 --> 30:28.637
Who's it from?

30:28.638 --> 30:32.097
It's not signed. There's just a note
that says "Last night".

30:37.928 --> 30:40.617
What is it?
Atticus.

30:40.618 --> 30:44.225
Picking up a tart of some kind
and letting her into his room.

30:44.226 --> 30:45.198
What?!

30:46.978 --> 30:49.357
Oh, God.
Have some water.

30:49.358 --> 30:53.226
Are you ready to order?
May we have a few more moments?

30:57.539 --> 31:01.447
What are you going to do?
I'm not sure.

31:01.448 --> 31:05.228
Maybe I'll chuck tonight, but what
should I do about the wedding?

31:05.229 --> 31:06.827
I'll tell you what you'll do.

31:06.828 --> 31:10.027
Go and telephone Atticus now.
Arrange to see him this afternoon.

31:10.028 --> 31:11.590
Mary, go with her.

31:15.248 --> 31:19.087
This is classic
stag party stuff.

31:19.088 --> 31:21.298
You mean they got him drunk,
set him up,

31:21.299 --> 31:24.100
and booked a photographer to
maximise his embarrassment?

31:24.101 --> 31:27.069
I'm sure he's regretting it
bitterly this morning.

31:27.070 --> 31:30.225
But is "regretting it" enough?
It wouldn't be for me.

31:30.226 --> 31:33.780
There is a man who'd rather
this marriage didn't take place

31:33.781 --> 31:35.236
and his name's Lord Sinderby.

31:35.237 --> 31:37.857
Would he do something so grubby?

31:37.858 --> 31:41.920
You'd be surprised what people
can sink to, to get their own way.

31:44.978 --> 31:48.710
They're talking now. He'll meet her
in St James's Park at three.

31:51.628 --> 31:55.626
This is to confirm there'll be
no upstairs dinner tonight.

31:55.627 --> 31:57.712
The family is dining
with Lady Sinderby.

32:00.368 --> 32:03.296
I can't see why we bothered
to get an extra footman.

32:03.297 --> 32:07.057
We should've just hired some help
for the wedding and left it at that.

32:07.058 --> 32:09.369
It's unusual for
a bridegroom's parents

32:09.370 --> 32:11.770
to entertain just before a marriage.

32:11.771 --> 32:15.797
It feels quite foreign.
Maybe that sort do it differently.

32:15.798 --> 32:19.667
Oh, don't you start!
I am not prejudiced, Mrs Hughes.

32:19.668 --> 32:22.524
There are many things you could
accuse me of, but not that.

32:22.525 --> 32:25.000
How about lack of self knowledge?

32:27.768 --> 32:31.987
Mr Carson, could Andy
have some time off tonight?

32:31.988 --> 32:33.655
If the family don't need him?

32:33.656 --> 32:37.986
He's only been here a couple of days
and he's asking for extra time off?

32:37.987 --> 32:40.060
He wants me to show him
a bit of the town.

32:40.061 --> 32:41.357
And the Dowager?

32:41.358 --> 32:43.945
I'll be back in time
to put her to bed.

32:43.946 --> 32:46.794
I want everyone here
until the family leaves,

32:46.795 --> 32:49.975
and make sure you're back
by ten o'clock.

32:49.976 --> 32:53.344
What were you going to show him that
you didn't show him last night?

32:53.345 --> 32:56.075
Why? What did he tell you?

32:56.076 --> 33:00.335
Only that he didn't enjoy himself.
Oh poor Diddums.

33:00.336 --> 33:03.818
I hope he's made of
sterner stuff than that.

33:07.306 --> 33:11.865
I never even knew it existed.
Oh, I like these smaller museums.

33:11.866 --> 33:15.784
The Wallace Collection or
the Mauritshuis near the Hague.

33:15.785 --> 33:19.041
Have you been to Holland?
No, I've just read about it.

33:19.042 --> 33:23.075
It's as if the intimacy,
being near the paintings,

33:23.076 --> 33:25.735
makes them more powerful.

33:25.736 --> 33:28.655
I feel the same. Do you, Daisy?

33:28.656 --> 33:31.345
I feel as if I've been
down a coal hole

33:31.346 --> 33:34.637
and someone's opened the lid
and brought me into the sunlight.

33:34.638 --> 33:37.197
Well, that's very gratifying.
Is it, though?

33:37.198 --> 33:40.305
I feel so resentful, so discontented.

33:40.306 --> 33:43.952
It's as if my old life were a prison
I have to go back to.

33:43.953 --> 33:47.246
Don't say that! I don't want
to think I've made things worse.

33:47.247 --> 33:49.194
Isn't that Lady Rose?

33:50.616 --> 33:54.155
This doesn't even
make any sense! Stop!

33:54.156 --> 33:56.425
Let's leave them to it.

33:56.426 --> 33:59.885
I don't know. You're never safe
'til the ring's on your finger.

34:02.616 --> 34:05.625
Do you want to be safe, Miss Baxter?

34:05.626 --> 34:07.606
I might.

34:13.377 --> 34:15.755
You really believe
I would stoop so low?

34:15.757 --> 34:18.232
You think that of me?
I am satisfied it was not a prank.

34:18.233 --> 34:21.686
Rather a plan to induce Lady Rose
to withdraw from the marriage?

34:21.687 --> 34:25.754
Call her Rose, for heaven's sake.
And you think I am the perpetrator?

34:25.755 --> 34:27.695
You are opposed to my marrying her,

34:27.696 --> 34:30.268
much more so than I have confessed
to Rose or her family.

34:30.270 --> 34:33.235
Very well. Let us be honest.

34:33.235 --> 34:34.895
I am against it.

34:34.896 --> 34:38.447
Our family has achieved a great deal
since we came to this country

34:38.447 --> 34:41.201
and not just for ourselves,
for our people.

34:41.202 --> 34:43.225
We have a proud history

34:43.226 --> 34:46.165
and we've taken our place among
the leaders in this land.

34:46.166 --> 34:49.170
And now, you want to throw all
that away for this little shiksa.

34:49.172 --> 34:51.735
Don't call her that!
I'm sorry.

34:51.735 --> 34:55.036
I don't mean to insult the girl.
She seems decent enough.

34:55.036 --> 34:59.665
But she is English and Anglican
and so will her children be...

34:59.666 --> 35:02.315
She's Scottish.
British, then.

35:02.316 --> 35:05.595
The second Lord Sinderby may be
Jewish, but the third will not.

35:05.596 --> 35:08.637
Soon our family will be
one more British dynasty

35:08.638 --> 35:11.884
with all the same prejudices as
everyone else who shops at Harrods!

35:11.885 --> 35:14.916
Any children will be brought up to
know both sides of their heritage.

35:14.917 --> 35:18.266
Your children will not be Jewish!
Don't you understand that?

35:18.267 --> 35:21.989
Their mother will not be Jewish
and neither will they!

35:21.990 --> 35:23.975
They may choose to convert.

35:23.976 --> 35:27.355
Or are you implacably opposed
to giving anyone a free choice?

35:27.356 --> 35:29.865
How easy you make it sound,

35:29.866 --> 35:32.945
and how little you've had to fight.

35:32.946 --> 35:34.755
You must come.

35:34.756 --> 35:36.099
They're here.

35:38.026 --> 35:40.345
I need your word it wasn't you.

35:40.346 --> 35:42.435
Of course it wasn't me!

35:42.436 --> 35:44.404
Don't you know me at all?

35:50.618 --> 35:52.849
Atticus says it must have been
a practical joke.

35:52.850 --> 35:55.218
Do you believe him?
I don't think it was a joke.

35:55.219 --> 35:57.285
It was either true and he's lying,

35:57.286 --> 35:59.934
or someone is trying
to stop the wedding.

35:59.935 --> 36:02.636
I'd like to know which.
Preferably before Friday.

36:02.637 --> 36:06.527
Rose, may I introduce you to
my cousin, Sir John?

36:06.528 --> 36:08.218
Come.

36:08.219 --> 36:10.221
Edith, darling!
Excuse me.

36:12.209 --> 36:14.588
We'd better act fast
before it all hits the rocks.

36:14.589 --> 36:17.639
Everything seems to be
hitting the rocks at the moment.

36:17.640 --> 36:20.047
That's a bit sad.
I mean it.

36:20.048 --> 36:22.928
Sybil was my ally and she's gone.
Now Rose.

36:22.929 --> 36:25.219
You're about to leave
and take Sybbie with you.

36:25.220 --> 36:28.546
It's too much to bear.
Mary, I must live my life.

36:28.547 --> 36:30.944
What? And leave me alone with Edith?

36:30.945 --> 36:34.306
When you read I'm on trial
for murder, it'll be your fault.

36:36.008 --> 36:38.697
Maybe you're right
and it wasn't a joke,

36:38.698 --> 36:40.898
but all I care about
is you should believe me.

36:40.899 --> 36:44.577
Of course I do, but it's almost worse
to know there's someone out there

36:44.578 --> 36:46.927
who hates us enough
to concoct such a lie.

36:46.928 --> 36:50.866
Tell us more about British India.
It's a wonderful country.

36:50.867 --> 36:52.817
Bombay is a marvellous city.

36:52.818 --> 36:55.735
I'm not sure how long
British India has to go.

36:55.736 --> 36:58.337
We heard about that terrible
Amritsar business.

36:58.338 --> 37:00.730
Amritsar was a very
unfortunate incident,

37:00.731 --> 37:02.717
ordered by a foolish man.

37:02.718 --> 37:05.949
I can't agree. General Dyer
was just doing his duty.

37:05.950 --> 37:10.647
You haven't got that quite right.
We're entitled to our own opinion.

37:10.648 --> 37:15.472
Are we? I hesitate to remind you that
Shrimpie knows India and you don't.

37:20.078 --> 37:21.907
You look very serious.

37:21.908 --> 37:23.617
Granny, do you think Lord Sinderby

37:23.618 --> 37:26.020
would try anything horrible
to prevent the wedding?

37:26.021 --> 37:29.208
He'd certainly like it stopped.

37:29.209 --> 37:31.897
But he does love Atticus.

37:31.898 --> 37:36.131
My dear, love is a far more
dangerous motive than dislike.

37:38.568 --> 37:41.647
Go on. It's no fun on my own.

37:41.648 --> 37:44.959
You never talked to me from the time
we got there. Go and get changed.

37:50.178 --> 37:52.377
Why are you bullying him,
Miss Denker?

37:52.378 --> 37:54.375
Can't you pick on
someone your own age?

37:54.376 --> 37:56.008
He'll have fun when he gets there.

37:56.009 --> 37:59.405
Maybe, but I suspect you're
a bad influence all the same.

37:59.406 --> 38:02.561
Then I suspect we have something
in common, Mr Barrow.

38:04.828 --> 38:06.797
Cheeky.

38:06.798 --> 38:10.248
If it was so lovely, why have you
been in a gloom since you got back?

38:10.249 --> 38:12.128
It showed me what I've been missing.

38:12.129 --> 38:15.637
Before I started studying I thought
history, art or 'owt like that

38:15.638 --> 38:17.806
were only for the family, not for us.

38:17.807 --> 38:20.545
Surely it's a good thing,
if your horizons have expanded?

38:20.546 --> 38:24.147
In a way, but it's shown me how
empty my life's been until now.

38:24.148 --> 38:26.710
You've learned a trade.
You're skilled.

38:26.711 --> 38:29.578
You're an artist yourself.
Look at this wedding cake.

38:29.579 --> 38:32.629
What for? So I can skivvy in
a kitchen that isn't even mine?

38:32.630 --> 38:36.126
Wasn't it your plan to study so you
could help run Mr Mason's farm?

38:36.127 --> 38:39.685
But even if I do that in the end,
wouldn't I be better studying here,

38:39.686 --> 38:43.484
with galleries and libraries
and theatres all around me?

38:43.485 --> 38:45.890
I could get a job in London,
I know I could.

38:45.891 --> 38:48.397
I'm sure you could.
Then that's it.

38:48.398 --> 38:52.107
I've made my mind up.
I'm handing in my notice.

38:53.478 --> 38:56.237
Oh... Oh, Daisy.

38:56.238 --> 38:59.038
You've been very good to me,
Mrs Patmore,

38:59.039 --> 39:02.749
and I'll be sad to say goodbye,
but I think it's right.

39:09.878 --> 39:12.614
Hasn't she brushed it off
as a malicious trap?

39:12.615 --> 39:14.887
Yes, she has, but who would do it?

39:14.888 --> 39:17.088
Granny thinks it might
be Lord Sinderby.

39:17.089 --> 39:18.534
Ought we to challenge him?

39:18.535 --> 39:21.877
Can I give you a nightcap?
Yes, please.

39:21.878 --> 39:25.037
Not for me. I'm tired.

39:25.038 --> 39:26.907
Ah, and you?

39:26.908 --> 39:29.172
No, but I'll look in
to say good night.

39:31.468 --> 39:34.529
Where are Miss Denker and Andrew?
Not back yet, Mr Carson.

39:34.530 --> 39:36.976
I said I wanted everyone in
by ten o'clock.

39:36.977 --> 39:39.667
I'm sure they won't be long.
Hmm!

39:39.668 --> 39:43.219
Where have they got to?
God knows. It's hard for Mr Carson.

39:43.220 --> 39:45.216
Miss Denker's not under
his jurisdiction.

39:45.217 --> 39:47.668
Andy won't be round long enough
to mind a black mark.

39:47.669 --> 39:50.958
She's using him in some way,
that lad, to her own benefit.

39:50.959 --> 39:53.257
Which I do not like to see.

39:53.258 --> 39:55.287
Cocoa if anyone wants it?

39:55.288 --> 39:56.977
Thank you, Mrs Patmore.

39:56.978 --> 39:58.836
You should have let me do that.

39:58.837 --> 40:01.559
I shall have to manage without you.
I may as well get used to it.

40:01.560 --> 40:02.897
Don't be like that.

40:02.898 --> 40:05.754
I'm not 'like' anything.
I'm just facing facts.

40:12.928 --> 40:15.137
What are you doing in here?

40:15.138 --> 40:18.028
Waiting for you.
I can't think why.

40:20.018 --> 40:22.287
Did you enjoy this evening?

40:22.288 --> 40:25.387
Not really, no. In fact, I hated it.

40:25.388 --> 40:29.154
Having to play act in front of
those people is so degrading.

40:29.155 --> 40:32.057
It's not for much longer.

40:32.058 --> 40:37.498
Did you know that Anne Melford was Jewish?
I neither knew nor didn't know.
What difference does it make?

40:37.499 --> 40:40.107
No need to parade your
pseudo-tolerance here.

40:40.108 --> 40:42.999
We are quite alone.
I don't feel as you do about it.

40:43.000 --> 40:45.348
Or about anything else.

40:45.349 --> 40:47.431
I want no more of your tricks.
Is that clear?

40:47.432 --> 40:49.266
I don't know what you mean.

40:49.267 --> 40:51.989
Yes, you do, and if you
don't promise to behave,

40:51.990 --> 40:54.948
I will tell Rose and we'll see
what she makes of it.

40:54.949 --> 40:58.218
You're talking in riddles.
You set up Atticus.

40:58.219 --> 41:02.187
The whole cheap, dirty episode
began and ended with you.

41:02.188 --> 41:05.297
Just because Rose was
too clever to be taken in,

41:05.298 --> 41:06.949
doesn't mean she'd forgive you.

41:06.950 --> 41:08.328
Are you ill?

41:08.329 --> 41:10.798
I was curious to know about
the payment you spoke of.

41:10.799 --> 41:15.177
I read the chequebook stub
and telephoned the firm.

41:15.178 --> 41:17.795
Get down, you cat!

41:18.978 --> 41:22.707
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

41:22.708 --> 41:25.200
That we have lost our money...

41:26.488 --> 41:29.017
...that we have lost our position

41:29.018 --> 41:32.500
that we have lost everything
the children have grown up

41:32.501 --> 41:34.946
expecting as their right.

41:36.748 --> 41:39.937
And now you want Rose
to be an outcast?

41:39.938 --> 41:42.782
I'm not saying everything
will be easy for them,

41:42.783 --> 41:46.338
but who has a life where
everything is easy?

41:46.339 --> 41:50.627
Not us.
And God knows not her.

41:50.628 --> 41:53.577
Don't mention the divorce
until after she's tied the knot.

41:53.578 --> 41:56.187
Do you think he'd put his foot down
at the eleventh hour?

41:56.188 --> 41:59.138
I'm warning you,
if this marriage does not go ahead,

41:59.139 --> 42:01.130
Rose will know the part you played.

42:12.128 --> 42:17.107
Since we're all here, I've decided
what to do about the cottages.

42:17.108 --> 42:19.217
I'm going to sell
the Della Francesca.

42:19.218 --> 42:22.355
I've been to Sotheby's
and we'll get a good price.

42:22.356 --> 42:24.670
Are you sure?
You've always been so proud of it.

42:24.671 --> 42:26.897
I don't enjoy it as I did.

42:26.898 --> 42:31.897
My Papa always said one should only
sell for a purpose and I agree.

42:31.898 --> 42:34.757
The good of the village
can be that purpose.

42:34.758 --> 42:38.560
I'm pleased. Now we can get on with
the work as soon as we're home.

42:38.561 --> 42:39.640
Shall we?

42:42.248 --> 42:46.276
I've spoiled the painting for you,
haven't I, with Mr Bricker?

42:46.277 --> 42:49.107
That's why you're selling.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.667
Yes.

42:50.668 --> 42:52.830
But not in the way you think.

42:54.388 --> 42:57.678
Every time I look at it,
I am reminded that I didn't trust you

42:57.679 --> 43:01.434
and I feel so angry with myself,
I want to be rid of it.

43:04.978 --> 43:06.798
Oh, that is a horrid trick!

43:06.799 --> 43:09.547
Whoever thought it up
has a nasty mind.

43:09.548 --> 43:13.746
What shocks me most is that anyone
could want me to be so unhappy.

43:13.747 --> 43:15.059
Excuse me.

43:16.598 --> 43:19.835
This is what troubles me,
would I be right to marry Dickie

43:19.836 --> 43:21.968
when I know his sons
would hate us to be happy?

43:21.969 --> 43:25.259
That's all very well, but let them
cheat you of your future?

43:25.260 --> 43:29.528
I am sorry to disturb you, m'lady,
but Miss Denker is not well,

43:29.529 --> 43:32.207
so Miss Baxter will
look after you tonight.

43:32.208 --> 43:34.827
Will she be all right?
It's nothing serious, m'lady.

43:34.828 --> 43:36.677
Thank you.

43:36.678 --> 43:40.467
At last I have a plan,
start the work in the village,

43:40.468 --> 43:44.177
find the new agent
and set off for America.

43:44.178 --> 43:46.737
But won't all that take months?

43:46.738 --> 43:49.002
Why don't we say I'll stay
for Christmas then go?

43:50.349 --> 43:52.218
It's a dagger in my heart.

43:52.219 --> 43:54.066
I don't know what
I'll do without you.

43:54.067 --> 43:58.269
Did you ever think you'd say that
when I drove you to your fittings?

43:58.270 --> 44:01.956
And Sybil got her to make evening
pyjamas and Granny almost fainted.

44:05.938 --> 44:08.707
We have our memories, you and I.

44:08.708 --> 44:12.067
But now you'll take them away
with you to Boston.

44:12.068 --> 44:14.436
And I'll cherish them
when I get there.

44:16.568 --> 44:19.845
It's a long way to Tipperary.
I think you need to calm down.

44:19.846 --> 44:23.297
You need to calm down, Miss Denker.
To go...

44:23.298 --> 44:26.257
Go and get Mrs Hughes.

44:26.258 --> 44:28.177
To Tipperary...

44:28.178 --> 44:31.987
Oh, I must get up to my lady.
No, I'm doing it.

44:31.988 --> 44:34.480
Mr Carson's told her you're ill.
Ill?

44:34.481 --> 44:37.477
Really, Miss Denker.
And in front of the maids, too!

44:37.478 --> 44:40.473
Well, who gives a tinker's curse
about the maids?

44:40.474 --> 44:42.927
Right. That's quite enough of that.

44:42.928 --> 44:45.675
And as for you, where have you been?
You don't want to know.

44:45.676 --> 44:47.856
Put on your livery
and get to the drawing room.

44:47.857 --> 44:50.124
Maybe if I made her coffee,
it might sober her up.

44:50.125 --> 44:52.440
Anything's worth a try.

45:00.388 --> 45:03.987
Mrs Patmore? Whatever's the matter?
Don't mind me.

45:03.988 --> 45:06.747
Tell me!
No. It wouldn't be fair.

45:06.748 --> 45:08.407
Fair to who?

45:08.408 --> 45:11.394
To you, you daft ha'porth.
I don't understand.

45:11.395 --> 45:14.517
I'm crying because
I don't want you to leave.

45:14.518 --> 45:16.353
I'll miss you.

45:17.778 --> 45:21.078
Don't... don't concern yourself.
I'll get over it.

45:21.079 --> 45:23.257
I'll work out a month's notice.

45:23.258 --> 45:25.436
I have to come back for
the memorial ceremony,

45:25.437 --> 45:27.635
and I haven't got another job yet.

45:27.636 --> 45:31.497
Forget the coffee.
She's gone up, thank the Lord.

45:31.498 --> 45:34.342
We should go, too.
You're right.

45:39.219 --> 45:42.587
Has something happened?
No. Not yet.

45:46.828 --> 45:50.826
Ah, you've come back, then?
We thought you'd run away to sea.

45:50.827 --> 45:53.677
I'm very sorry, Mr Carson,
but Miss Denker was taken ill.

45:53.678 --> 45:56.877
Never mind "taken ill,"
I wish she'd been taken away.

45:56.878 --> 45:59.338
By the men in white coats.

45:59.339 --> 46:00.921
Go down, Mr Carson. We'll manage.

46:04.339 --> 46:06.107
What happened?

46:06.108 --> 46:09.627
She took me to this horrible club
somewhere off Shaftesbury Avenue.

46:09.628 --> 46:12.386
And I suppose you gambled.
I lost the lot.

46:12.387 --> 46:14.790
I paid for it on the note
but it'll take all my savings.

46:14.791 --> 46:17.417
I bet she didn't lose a thing? Hmm.

46:17.418 --> 46:20.827
One question,
she's not made a play for you?

46:20.828 --> 46:22.399
Done anything improper?

46:22.400 --> 46:25.476
No! God no. No, nothing like that.
She just sat and drank.

46:25.477 --> 46:27.907
They gave her whatever she wanted.
I see.

46:27.908 --> 46:31.715
At least, I think I see.
Next time I'm coming with you.

46:31.716 --> 46:35.035
Does there have to be a next time?
Yes. just one more.

46:35.036 --> 46:37.406
I'm fairly sure
you're gonna enjoy it.

46:45.398 --> 46:48.567
I dare say this is
a first for you, Granny,

46:48.568 --> 46:51.276
to sample the joys of
a registry office.

46:51.277 --> 46:54.987
You'd be quite wrong, no, in 1878

46:54.988 --> 46:59.135
I attended the wedding of
Lord Rosebery and Hannah Rothschild

46:59.136 --> 47:01.961
held in the Board of Guardians,
very much the same.

47:01.962 --> 47:04.307
It seems almost sad in a way.

47:04.308 --> 47:08.211
But in marrying a Rothschild,
there are certain compensations.

47:08.212 --> 47:10.577
Is Lady Flintshire all right?

47:10.578 --> 47:14.560
Cora, would you go and help Susan?
She seems in rather a queer way.

47:14.561 --> 47:17.307
There is something
that you must know

47:17.308 --> 47:20.827
and I feel most uncomfortable
not having told you before now.

47:20.828 --> 47:23.634
We don't want any
deathbed confessions, Susan.

47:23.635 --> 47:25.316
Remember, this is not your day!

47:25.317 --> 47:27.869
I'm sorry, Aunt Violet.
I think it's time.

47:27.870 --> 47:29.557
In fact, it's long overdue.

47:29.558 --> 47:30.906
What is?
No, please.

47:30.907 --> 47:34.141
Shrimpie and I are in the process
of getting a divorce.

47:34.142 --> 47:35.338
What?!

47:35.339 --> 47:38.798
I'm afraid it is going to be all
over the papers and as things stand,

47:38.799 --> 47:41.458
it must involve you and your family.

47:41.459 --> 47:43.962
God if I...
Thank you, Lady Flintshire.

47:43.963 --> 47:45.907
Or may I call you Susan?

47:45.908 --> 47:50.187
We are forewarned
and so now we will be forearmed.

47:50.188 --> 47:52.195
You can't mean...
Father, I beg you...

47:52.196 --> 47:55.866
Do anything to stop this marriage,
anything at all, I will leave you,

47:55.867 --> 47:59.431
and then you will have a scandal
worthy of the name!

48:10.589 --> 48:14.338
Oh, I doubt you expected
to take your beloved child

48:14.339 --> 48:17.480
through the portals of
Caxton Hall Registry Office.

48:17.481 --> 48:20.234
There are lots of things
in my life I never anticipated,

48:20.235 --> 48:22.699
but if you're sure, I'm sure.

48:24.308 --> 48:27.307
By the way, Atticus was blameless.

48:27.308 --> 48:30.057
I'm ashamed now that I wobbled.

48:30.058 --> 48:33.137
I know he was blameless.
How can you know?

48:33.138 --> 48:36.338
Well I do, beyond a trace of doubt.

48:36.339 --> 48:39.338
Who did my enemy turn out to be?

48:39.339 --> 48:43.427
Never mind about that.
You don't know him. Not properly.

48:43.428 --> 48:46.397
Then I don't want to know.

48:46.398 --> 48:49.497
I don't want to hate anyone today.

48:49.498 --> 48:51.995
You do realise
this is my real wedding?

48:51.996 --> 48:55.356
Not the blessing this afternoon?
This is where I become his wife.

48:56.778 --> 49:01.170
And I hope you will be very,
very happy, my dearest darling.

49:09.028 --> 49:12.027
I don't believe it. Is that it?

49:12.028 --> 49:14.634
Am I just expected
to be a good loser?

49:14.635 --> 49:18.043
It's too late for that, my dear,
far too late.

49:20.839 --> 49:22.005
Please stand.

49:51.104 --> 49:54.563
Er, listen everyone,
as soon as they've finished lunch,

49:54.625 --> 49:56.974
they'll get ready for
the blessing at half past two.

49:56.995 --> 49:58.606
Those going to the Savoy Chapel,

49:58.665 --> 50:01.145
there'll be a coach to bring you
for the reception.

50:01.200 --> 50:03.287
What about dinner, Mr Carson?
Just family.

50:03.288 --> 50:05.862
Her ladyship wants a buffet
of what's left over.

50:05.863 --> 50:07.639
I might add some hot soup.

50:07.640 --> 50:09.796
I should go.
I'm helping Lady Rose to change.

50:09.797 --> 50:11.946
I don't think it's right
to put on a wedding dress

50:11.947 --> 50:13.526
when it's only a blessing.

50:13.527 --> 50:17.197
She won't wear a veil.
You're right. We should get on.

50:17.198 --> 50:21.320
So, we should be able to get away
later on if you're up for it.

50:21.321 --> 50:24.599
After her ladyship's gone to bed.
You mean you want to come?

50:24.600 --> 50:26.958
You've been having lots of fun,
Miss Denker.

50:26.959 --> 50:30.362
Unless you feel the worse for wear?
I don't know what you mean.

50:30.363 --> 50:32.588
I had a headache, that's all.

50:32.589 --> 50:36.948
If he's coming, you needn't bother.
No! We want Andy with us.

50:36.949 --> 50:39.838
With you for what?
Nothing, Mrs Hughes.

50:39.839 --> 50:42.501
Andy, you take your
life in your hands

50:42.502 --> 50:45.688
if you throw in your lot
with these two.

51:06.660 --> 51:10.237
Lord Sinderby, please believe
that I love your son very much

51:10.238 --> 51:13.748
and whatever I can do to
make him happy, I will do.

51:13.749 --> 51:17.243
We know that, my dear, and we wish
every blessing on your head.

51:19.039 --> 51:23.169
Well, well, the thing is done.
Let us go forward in hope.

51:27.499 --> 51:30.478
Ah, look who's coming your way.

51:30.479 --> 51:35.238
Hello, Tony. How lovely to see you.
And you of course, Mabel.

51:35.239 --> 51:37.929
Welcome.
Are we welcome? I hope so.

51:37.930 --> 51:40.672
You're as welcome here as I trust
I will be at your wedding.

51:42.379 --> 51:44.977
Is it just me who's embarrassed?
I'm not embarrassed.

51:44.978 --> 51:48.227
We're getting married in December.
We'd be delighted to see you there.

51:48.228 --> 51:51.408
Oh, I am so pleased. Truly.
It'll be in London.

51:51.409 --> 51:53.959
Country weddings in the winter
can be such muddy affairs.

51:56.459 --> 51:59.589
I don't suppose we'll ever know
who did it now but who cares?

51:59.590 --> 52:02.196
It wasn't my father.
Oh, I never thought it was.

52:02.197 --> 52:04.658
I mean, I know he's against me,

52:04.659 --> 52:07.117
but that sort of thing's
not his style.

52:07.118 --> 52:11.018
You see? She already knows you
better than he does.

52:11.019 --> 52:13.787
I'm not sure it's what
she really wanted,

52:13.788 --> 52:15.898
a registry office
and the Savoy chapel.

52:15.899 --> 52:19.600
But, I think she'll be very happy.
I agree. They're well matched.

52:19.601 --> 52:22.934
When are you going home?
First thing. I can't wait.

52:22.935 --> 52:27.718
The call of young Marigold.
You sound as if you don't approve.

52:27.719 --> 52:29.799
Oh, it's not that...

52:29.800 --> 52:34.308
Oh, look. It's Tony and Mary.
They make a handsome couple.

52:34.309 --> 52:37.006
Give it up, Papa. It's a pipe dream.

52:40.229 --> 52:43.332
So, it turned out as you planned.

52:43.333 --> 52:46.433
You were just what I needed
when I needed it.

52:46.434 --> 52:49.296
I hope you know that.
Well, I know a lot of things.

52:49.297 --> 52:52.028
One of them is not to mess
with Lady Mary Crawley.

52:52.029 --> 52:54.185
But everything's come right?

52:54.186 --> 52:58.214
Hmm, it has for me.
I hope it does for you, too.

52:59.696 --> 53:00.777
Good luck, Mary.

53:07.376 --> 53:11.119
Lord Sinderby has taken Brancaster
Castle for the grouse this year.

53:11.120 --> 53:12.345
In Northumberland?

53:12.346 --> 53:15.274
Yes, and we wondered if you
might like to join us there?

53:15.275 --> 53:18.763
That's very kind. All of you.
It would give us great pleasure.

53:18.764 --> 53:21.226
All of us? I wonder if you know
what you're taking on!

53:21.227 --> 53:24.288
I'll telephone Lady Grantham
and we'll talk dates.

53:24.289 --> 53:25.802
I look forward to it.

53:26.897 --> 53:29.705
That wasn't too hard, was it?

53:29.706 --> 53:33.507
Not hard for me, since I was allowed
no say in the matter. None at all.

53:33.508 --> 53:36.716
He seems like a wonderful boy.
Thank you, that's very kind.

53:38.546 --> 53:41.437
I heard about your declaration
at the registry office.

53:41.438 --> 53:44.123
All I want is your happiness,
my darling.

53:44.124 --> 53:48.896
Whatever I said or did
was done from love.

53:48.897 --> 53:52.720
I'm afraid we must have different
definitions of the word.

53:56.416 --> 53:57.705
Hmm.

53:57.706 --> 53:59.945
How are you two bearing up?

53:59.946 --> 54:01.869
Well, thank you, Lady Manville.

54:01.870 --> 54:03.185
I do feel for you.

54:03.186 --> 54:05.335
It must be very trying,

54:05.336 --> 54:07.572
but I so admire you
for putting on a good face.

54:07.573 --> 54:10.285
I wonder if you remember
that my father was Jewish?

54:10.286 --> 54:11.745
Oh.

54:11.746 --> 54:14.033
I'm afraid I...

54:15.066 --> 54:17.080
That is... How interesting...

54:18.416 --> 54:22.125
Ah, Louise, I wasn't expecting
to find you here.

54:33.456 --> 54:37.646
Is everything all right, m'lady?
I thought I'd sneak away.

54:37.647 --> 54:41.975
I don't think I'll be missed.
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

54:41.976 --> 54:45.465
I feel as if our household
is breaking up, Carson,

54:45.466 --> 54:48.425
but I suppose that's what happens.

54:48.426 --> 54:52.345
People grow up and move away
and things change.

54:52.346 --> 54:55.545
I hope Lord Gillingham
hasn't upset you?

54:55.546 --> 54:57.295
Oh, no.

54:57.296 --> 55:00.778
He's happy with Miss Lane Fox
and I'm happy for them.

55:00.779 --> 55:03.745
Because if I might be
permitted to say so?

55:03.746 --> 55:07.705
He wasn't good enough for you,
m'lady, not by half.

55:07.706 --> 55:10.506
I don't think anyone else
would agree with you.

55:10.507 --> 55:12.726
But the difference is
that you agree with me.

55:12.727 --> 55:16.145
I watched you realise it
as time went on.

55:16.146 --> 55:18.295
Reluctantly perhaps,

55:18.296 --> 55:22.025
but you came to see that
he wasn't up to the mark.

55:22.026 --> 55:25.045
I'm not sure if that's
alarming or reassuring

55:25.046 --> 55:27.347
coming from someone
who knows me so well.

55:27.348 --> 55:31.898
Reassuring I hope, for I'm confident
that you will triumph in the end.

55:31.899 --> 55:36.859
Thank you, Carson.
That means more to me than you know.

55:39.246 --> 55:42.565
Oh no, it was a funny marriage.

55:42.566 --> 55:44.955
No proper service, no veil!

55:44.956 --> 55:47.373
You'd have thought
one of them was divorced.

55:47.374 --> 55:50.176
I wish them well.
I don't mind Lady Rose, me.

55:50.177 --> 55:53.740
Is this it?
Welcome to the Velvet Violin.

55:55.556 --> 55:57.125
Thank you.

55:57.126 --> 55:58.875
We'll go in separately.

55:58.876 --> 56:00.867
Don't talk to me
'til we're at the tables.

56:05.146 --> 56:07.625
Back again, Miss Denker?

56:07.626 --> 56:10.357
I've brought two with me.
The new boy and another one.

56:10.358 --> 56:14.362
So I see. Give yourself a drink
and help 'em find the tables.

56:14.363 --> 56:15.677
Thank you.

56:16.826 --> 56:19.124
What's his name?
The one she was talking to.

56:19.936 --> 56:21.985
Erm, Basil Shute. Why?

56:21.986 --> 56:23.825
You'll see.

56:23.826 --> 56:26.185
Are you going 1:0 play?

56:26.186 --> 56:29.055
I might have a go. Pontoon's my game.

56:29.056 --> 56:32.310
But don't you. Right?

56:34.146 --> 56:37.514
That was quite a marathon,
but I think a happy one.

56:37.515 --> 56:40.036
Oh, yes. They're well suited.

56:40.037 --> 56:43.045
They were bound to find out
in the end about Lady Rose's parents.

56:43.046 --> 56:45.757
At least it's out in the open.
They'll have to lump it.

56:45.758 --> 56:49.355
Now that Lord Sinderby and
Lady Flintshire both have a reason

56:49.356 --> 56:52.213
to look down on the other,
that should keep them quiet.

56:53.706 --> 56:55.825
Yes?

56:55.826 --> 57:00.205
I beg your pardon, m'lady,
but Anna's wanted downstairs.

57:00.206 --> 57:02.703
What do you mean, Mrs Hughes?
I haven't dismissed her.

57:02.704 --> 57:06.034
I know, m'lady and I feel
most uncomfortable but...

57:06.110 --> 57:10.059
What is it? What's happened?
Mr Vyner's downstairs.

57:10.060 --> 57:11.631
What?
But he hasn't...

57:11.632 --> 57:13.076
He says he's come to arrest you.

57:25.959 --> 57:28.872
Does that always happen?
Not always, no.

57:28.892 --> 57:31.732
Right. Cash them in
and pay your bill.

57:31.733 --> 57:34.472
I couldn't let you do that.
Why not?

57:34.473 --> 57:37.491
You want to get out of here alive?
I'd have to pay you back.

57:37.492 --> 57:40.066
We'll argue later.
Off you go while I see to Mr Shute.

57:40.067 --> 57:42.408
What do you mean?
Go.

57:46.983 --> 57:48.622
Excuse me,

57:48.623 --> 57:51.729
can you tell me which of these
knuckleheads is a Mr Basil Shute?

57:51.730 --> 57:53.122
Why?

57:53.123 --> 57:56.320
There's a woman who's boasting of
a trick she's played on him all week.

57:56.321 --> 57:58.342
Oh, yeah? What's that, then?

57:58.343 --> 58:01.847
Yeah, she erm, she waits outside
until someone's coming in,

58:01.848 --> 58:03.703
then she enters with them

58:03.704 --> 58:06.674
and claims free drinks all night
for bringing in new punters.

58:06.675 --> 58:08.502
Oh, she does, does she?

58:08.503 --> 58:10.992
It's the woman I arrived with.

58:10.993 --> 58:11.992
Bye!

58:11.993 --> 58:13.722
No! Wait!

58:17.553 --> 58:18.652
Bye.

58:18.653 --> 58:20.831
She chose me because she thought

58:20.832 --> 58:23.124
I was too young and stupid
to see what she was at.

58:23.125 --> 58:27.596
And she was right, wasn't she?
So, next time, ask your Uncle Thomas.

58:28.653 --> 58:30.212
Right, let's go.

58:31.824 --> 58:34.272
Oh, thank you.

58:34.273 --> 58:37.142
Haven't you forgotten something?

58:37.143 --> 58:38.833
What?

58:38.834 --> 58:42.725
Your bill for three nights' worth
of drinking, Miss Denker.

58:42.726 --> 58:45.792
That'll be four pounds
and ten shillings.

58:45.793 --> 58:49.072
I must wait for Mr Bates.
I can't go without telling him!

58:49.073 --> 58:51.203
It might be kinder
if you let him hear the news

58:51.204 --> 58:53.269
when he can't say anything
he'll regret.

58:53.270 --> 58:56.872
I forbid you to take her!
Correct forms have been observed.

58:56.873 --> 58:59.961
What is this? What's happening?
Don't make trouble, Mr Bates.

58:59.962 --> 59:01.854
You can't do this!
Try to keep calm.

59:01.855 --> 59:04.234
Can't I stand surety for her?
I'm afraid not, sir.

59:04.235 --> 59:07.215
Mrs Hughes, will you fetch her coat?
No! I can't let her go.

59:07.216 --> 59:09.713
A witness has identified Mrs Bates

59:09.714 --> 59:12.152
being on the pavement
near Mr Green before he fell.

59:12.153 --> 59:15.710
I insist on telephoning our lawyer!
Telephone all you like, Miss.

59:15.711 --> 59:18.120
He'll find Mrs Bates at
Gerald Row Police Station.

59:18.121 --> 59:20.269
I suggest you leave it
'til the morning.

59:20.270 --> 59:23.801
I will ring him now because
she is innocent and I am not "Miss"!

59:23.802 --> 59:25.562
I am Lady Mary Crawley!

59:25.563 --> 59:28.299
I don't care if you're
the Queen of the Upper Nile.

59:28.300 --> 59:30.648
I'm going and she's coming with me.

59:30.649 --> 59:31.998
NOW!

59:34.183 --> 59:35.127
Bates!

59:47.993 --> 59:50.982
"They fell with
their faces to the fold.

59:50.983 --> 59:55.142
"They shall grow not old,
as we that are left grow old.

59:55.143 --> 59:58.522
"Age shall not weary them,
nor the years condemn.

59:58.523 --> 01:00:02.262
"At the going down of the sun
and in the morning.

01:00:02.263 --> 01:00:05.122
"We will remember them."

01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:07.421
We will remember them.

01:00:52.423 --> 01:00:54.632
Stand at ease.

01:00:54.633 --> 01:00:56.010
Stand easy.

01:00:57.513 --> 01:01:03.432
Before you disperse, I would beg
your indulgence for a moment.

01:01:03.433 --> 01:01:06.643
Can I draw your attention
to one more gallant chap

01:01:06.644 --> 01:01:08.204
who volunteered to fight?

01:01:08.205 --> 01:01:12.357
He wasn't local to Downton and so his
name does not appear on the memorial,

01:01:12.358 --> 01:01:15.472
but his memory is cherished
by some here,

01:01:15.473 --> 01:01:19.573
and so it seems right to us
to mark his passing.

01:01:19.574 --> 01:01:20.939
Mrs Patmore?

01:01:43.673 --> 01:01:44.856
0h!

01:01:47.913 --> 01:01:49.961
"Sacrifice" is right.

01:01:51.673 --> 01:01:56.552
I think that's lovely, Mrs Patmore.
I'm so pleased for you.

01:01:56.553 --> 01:01:59.112
It's just as it should be.

01:01:59.113 --> 01:02:01.081
I believe so.

01:02:03.673 --> 01:02:07.155
I'd like to see William's name now.
If you've a moment, Daisy?

01:02:36.063 --> 01:02:39.942
My sister's going to
find it a real comfort.

01:02:39.943 --> 01:02:43.698
It'll be nice for you too, Daisy,
to have the memorial so near.

01:02:43.699 --> 01:02:49.392
I thought I'd feel sad when I read
William's name, and so I did.

01:02:49.393 --> 01:02:52.312
But I felt proud, too.

01:02:52.313 --> 01:02:54.142
Very proud.
Of course.

01:02:54.143 --> 01:02:56.001
Daisy may not be here forever,

01:02:56.002 --> 01:02:59.001
but that won't mean she's any
the less proud of our William.

01:02:59.002 --> 01:03:02.320
What? Are you going away, Daisy?
Well no, there's nothing wrong.

01:03:02.321 --> 01:03:03.815
She's got a taste for London,

01:03:03.816 --> 01:03:06.992
so we'll have to learn
to manage without her.

01:03:06.993 --> 01:03:11.339
At her age, it's right she should
have a new adventure, isn't it?

01:03:11.340 --> 01:03:14.512
Is this true, Daisy?
No, she's just teasing!

01:03:14.513 --> 01:03:17.042
At least, I did think about it,

01:03:17.043 --> 01:03:19.231
but I've decided
I'm not going anywhere,

01:03:19.232 --> 01:03:21.772
or not until after
I've passed my exams.

01:03:21.773 --> 01:03:23.272
I'm glad.

01:03:23.273 --> 01:03:27.062
I hate it when people who love
each other must be far apart.

01:03:39.063 --> 01:03:41.851
I know what you're thinking.

01:03:43.473 --> 01:03:46.072
It is not hard to guess, m'lady.

01:03:46.073 --> 01:03:50.583
She won't be convicted.
I don't even think she'll be tried.

01:03:50.584 --> 01:03:53.965
They have nothing to go on.
Nothing they're sharing with us.

01:03:53.966 --> 01:03:56.845
But you're right, m'lady,
she will not be convicted.

01:03:56.846 --> 01:04:01.488
Now we're back, do you really think
I should put up a fight for Dickie?

01:04:01.489 --> 01:04:05.641
You said you wouldn't do anything
'til after Rose's wedding.

01:04:05.642 --> 01:04:10.232
But, it's over,
so it's time for action.

01:04:10.233 --> 01:04:13.322
Fighting talk, indeed.

01:04:13.323 --> 01:04:16.372
And will you put up a fight
for Prince Kuragin?

01:04:17.834 --> 01:04:21.072
Well, you forget,
you hold the winning card.

01:04:21.073 --> 01:04:23.552
Lord Merton's wife is dead.

01:04:23.553 --> 01:04:27.632
I always forget how much
I enjoy London.

01:04:27.633 --> 01:04:31.242
You should go up more often,
take an interest in your publishing.

01:04:31.243 --> 01:04:33.794
You should get involved in
the running of the business.

01:04:33.795 --> 01:04:36.650
You're clever and a good writer.
They're lucky to have you.

01:04:36.651 --> 01:04:39.752
Mary always talks like
she's the only one

01:04:39.753 --> 01:04:43.064
who'll miss you when you go,
but you know I will, too.

01:04:43.065 --> 01:04:44.682
And I'll miss you.

01:04:44.683 --> 01:04:49.192
Poor Mr Bates. They locked him up
when he was innocent.

01:04:49.193 --> 01:04:51.493
Why shouldn't they do
the same with his wife?

01:04:51.494 --> 01:04:55.295
I have faith in British justice.
Mr Bates was released in the end.

01:04:55.296 --> 01:04:57.672
After he'd served time.

01:04:57.673 --> 01:05:02.762
Sorrow seems to shadow them both
and in their wake, it shadows us.

01:05:02.763 --> 01:05:05.963
Come, Mrs Hughes.
This isn't like you.

01:05:05.964 --> 01:05:10.515
Take courage for their sake.
We must always travel in hope.

01:05:12.633 --> 01:05:15.705
I realised what it is about Marigold
that keeps catching my eye.

01:05:15.706 --> 01:05:17.352
Oh, yes? What's that?

01:05:17.353 --> 01:05:19.447
She reminds me of Michael Gregson.

01:05:21.683 --> 01:05:23.703
Just tell me if I'm wrong.

01:05:23.704 --> 01:05:25.331
You're not wrong.

01:05:27.353 --> 01:05:29.642
Don't tell Edith you've guessed.
Why not?

01:05:29.643 --> 01:05:32.082
It makes things a good deal
clearer than they were.

01:05:32.083 --> 01:05:34.842
Just don't. Not yet.
Mary doesn't know either, nor Tom.

01:05:34.843 --> 01:05:36.984
Let it be Edith's secret
a little while longer.

01:05:38.793 --> 01:05:40.833
Very well.

01:05:40.834 --> 01:05:43.682
I must admit it's
an unusual sensation

01:05:43.683 --> 01:05:46.778
to learn there's a secret in
this house I'm actually privy to.

01:05:46.779 --> 01:05:49.448
But, I'll be silent if you wish.

01:05:51.143 --> 01:05:54.556
And you'll love her?
Your new granddaughter?

01:05:55.983 --> 01:05:59.322
As a matter of fact,
and perhaps to my surprise,

01:05:59.323 --> 01:06:01.883
I rather think I will.
