00:42.042 --> 00:43.876
I know, but it's coming.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.503
When is it?

00:47.297 --> 00:49.632
It's not gonna be too much longer.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.977
Spit your gum out. Come on. Thank you.

01:25.169 --> 01:27.003
Oh, here comes the train!

01:33.677 --> 01:35.386
Get behind me. Ally, stay behind me.

01:35.471 --> 01:36.679
Just take it. Take it.

01:36.764 --> 01:39.015
Give me your purse. Give me your purse.

01:40.058 --> 01:41.350
- Give me the ring!
- What?

01:41.435 --> 01:43.019
- Don't talk.
- It's gonna be okay.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.857
- Ally, don't look at them. No, no...
- Better not, lady.

01:50.277 --> 01:51.986
This is the Coney lsland-bound F train.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.155
Next stop Avenue I.

02:03.373 --> 02:04.540
No!

02:05.751 --> 02:09.252
Mom! Mom!

02:10.964 --> 02:14.926
Mom! Mom! Mom!

02:15.552 --> 02:18.888
Mom! Mom!

02:19.389 --> 02:20.640
Mom!

03:37.968 --> 03:39.468
Daddy!

05:24.449 --> 05:25.533
Hello?

05:26.785 --> 05:28.661
Fifteen minutes.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.895
- How are you, Mom?
- You look good.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.443
- How you doing, Les?
- Good to see you.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.614
Thanks for the wake-up call, Maestro.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.617
You smell like Listerine and beer.

06:14.291 --> 06:16.125
You couldn't wear a tie?

06:17.961 --> 06:19.211
I could have.

06:39.399 --> 06:44.070
This is nice. Michael would like

06:44.696 --> 06:46.655
that we still do this.

06:50.744 --> 06:54.789
Did you tell Tyler what your art teacher said
about your portrait?

06:54.873 --> 06:55.998
Mom!

06:56.083 --> 06:57.541
Tell him!

06:58.001 --> 07:03.631
She said I captured the moment
like a young James Whistler.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.510
Well, at least
it's a young James Whistler,

07:07.719 --> 07:12.181
because, God, I mean, Whistler,
he fell off in the latter half of his career.

07:12.349 --> 07:16.352
He is the Boyz ll Men
of European art history.

07:17.104 --> 07:20.272
She recommended your sister
to Steinhardt's Summer Art lntensive,

07:20.357 --> 07:23.484
- and that's hugely prestigious.
- It's fantastic.

07:23.568 --> 07:24.693
It's great.

07:24.986 --> 07:29.949
I'm going to do a drawing called
"My Brother and His Favorite Cigarette."

07:30.033 --> 07:34.745
And, since I'd be the youngest person ever,
practically, to be studying there...

07:34.830 --> 07:35.955
Tyler,

07:36.581 --> 07:38.541
would you please pass the sugar?

07:43.213 --> 07:49.093
She still has a couple of minutes left
on the clock, Dad.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.179
Just a couple of seconds.

07:53.223 --> 07:57.476
Caroline's perfectly capable of speaking up
if she's feeling slighted in any way.

07:57.727 --> 08:00.187
Have I slighted you in any way, Caroline?

08:01.148 --> 08:02.565
I'm fine.

08:06.945 --> 08:10.656
- I didn't mean to change the subject.
- What was the subject?

08:11.908 --> 08:12.908
Excuse me?

08:12.993 --> 08:15.411
The subject we were discussing.
What was it?

08:16.163 --> 08:18.455
Now is not the time for your heroics, Tyler.

08:18.665 --> 08:21.083
Actually, now is the perfect time.

08:22.961 --> 08:25.045
- All right. I gotta go.
- Tyler.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.339
Caroline, do you want me
to take you anywhere?

08:27.424 --> 08:30.551
- I'm okay. I'll stay with Mom.
- All right. I'll see you soon.

08:32.761 --> 08:34.013
The sugar.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.620
Eat something.

09:04.836 --> 09:09.381
Gandhi said that
whatever you do in Iife wiII be insignificant,

09:11.301 --> 09:13.719
but it's very important that you do it.

09:16.014 --> 09:17.973
I tend to agree with the first part.

09:20.727 --> 09:24.813
MichaeI, you know what day I'm staring at.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.485
By 22, Gandhi had three kids,

09:30.528 --> 09:32.863
Mozart, 30 symphonies,

09:34.074 --> 09:36.325
and Buddy HoIIy was dead.

09:43.833 --> 09:45.209
You once told me,

09:45.669 --> 09:49.171
"Our fingerprints don't fade
from the lives we touch."

09:52.008 --> 09:54.093
Is that true for everybody?

09:55.387 --> 09:57.263
Or was that just poetic bullshit?

09:57.514 --> 10:00.182
I sold your girlfriend a toothbrush.

10:01.017 --> 10:05.980
- You sold my who? What?
- You know, your girlfriend.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.233
That voluptuous,
delightfully oblivious little blonde

10:09.317 --> 10:10.567
you left in your bed yesterday?

10:10.652 --> 10:12.903
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I sold her a toothbrush.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.780
I got three bucks.

10:15.532 --> 10:17.783
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, are in order.

10:17.867 --> 10:20.452
'Cause that sale inspired
our newest business venture.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.037
The S.L.U.T.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.290
It's a Single Lady's Universal Tote.

10:24.541 --> 10:27.376
It's a one-night-stand travel pack
for women. You know?

10:27.669 --> 10:32.548
We throw in makeup and toiletries,
a cell phone charger, cab numbers...

10:32.632 --> 10:35.759
We retail it for $19.95.
Maybe we'd do an infomercial.

10:35.844 --> 10:40.180
Do you think women will buy this
with actual money?

10:40.765 --> 10:43.142
Okay. Yeah.
You know what? Fine. Be cynical.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.977
But think about it, at one point in history,

10:45.061 --> 10:47.938
two people had a conversation,
a lot like this one, about the light bulb.

10:48.023 --> 10:49.565
One went on to fame and fortune,

10:49.649 --> 10:52.526
the other probably went to work
at Mickey D's or something.

10:53.945 --> 10:56.530
In the wake of recent terrorist attacks,

10:56.614 --> 11:00.784
do you guys think there's a place
for a discussion about ethics

11:00.869 --> 11:04.496
when we're talking about
the root causes of terrorism?

11:05.498 --> 11:07.541
Wasn't it a moral question,
not an ethical one?

11:07.625 --> 11:11.128
- How so?
- Well, morals define personal character.

11:11.212 --> 11:12.254
And ethics?

11:12.339 --> 11:14.423
The standards of behavior expected
by a group.

11:14.507 --> 11:17.051
And in the end,
personal character is more important?

11:17.135 --> 11:19.803
- Absolutely.
- That's a good point.

11:19.888 --> 11:23.932
Does knowledge of the past
limit us or benefit us?

11:25.852 --> 11:28.312
Can we make this
a non-smoking statue?

11:28.938 --> 11:32.775
Yeah, Tyler.
Can we make this a non-smoking statue?

11:34.152 --> 11:37.738
- You promised you'd quit.
- I know.

11:47.457 --> 11:52.086
Why do you think Dad
doesn't wanna listen to me?

11:54.172 --> 11:56.965
- Dad loves you.
- So?

11:57.467 --> 12:00.636
You can love someone
and not want to spend time with them.

12:01.513 --> 12:05.557
- Yeah, you got that right.
- Mom loves Aunt Sara.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.726
But at Christmas last year,

12:07.811 --> 12:10.396
she wouldn't let Les leave them
in a room together

12:10.480 --> 12:14.441
'cause she said that there'd be
a "Yuletide homicide."

12:15.402 --> 12:18.320
That's 'cause Aunt Sara drinks.
You don't drink, do you?

12:19.030 --> 12:20.656
I'm 11 .

12:23.493 --> 12:25.911
So why would anyone ever want
to avoid you?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.500
Michael used to drink.

12:33.211 --> 12:35.504
That's 'cause Michael was 21 .

12:36.172 --> 12:42.428
When you're 21 , drinking's new
and exciting, and everybody does it.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.723
Aunt Sara drinks
'cause she wishes she was 21 .

12:47.684 --> 12:49.184
You're 21 .

12:51.521 --> 12:52.688
Okay.

12:58.945 --> 13:02.156
Hey, what about Atlantic City
for your birthday this year, man?

13:02.240 --> 13:05.284
- Really?
- Yeah. We'll get a suite.

13:06.202 --> 13:07.870
You could call Toothbrush Girl.

13:07.954 --> 13:11.832
I think I'd rather be sodomized
with a toothbrush than that.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.461
It's your day, man.
We can work something out.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.672
The schematic for these particular shelves

13:18.756 --> 13:22.217
is of authors who have slept together
and ended up dead or in prison.

13:22.886 --> 13:24.052
No shit?

13:24.137 --> 13:25.304
Shit.

13:27.223 --> 13:29.016
See, that's why chicks dig you, man.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.895
No, seriously.
They love this freaky poetic crap.

13:33.188 --> 13:36.482
Oh! I ran into Megan yesterday.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.401
She's bartending at Don Hill's tonight, man.
Wants us to stop by.

13:40.028 --> 13:43.447
She practically begged me.
Yeah, poor thing.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.450
Hey!

13:48.661 --> 13:50.287
- Hey!
- "Hey," nothing, man! What's...

13:51.456 --> 13:52.664
What?

13:54.501 --> 13:58.253
All right, look, you've been a ghost
the past couple of weeks, all right?

13:58.755 --> 14:00.422
You never wanna go out anymore.

14:02.425 --> 14:05.886
I've had enough
of this brooding introvert shit, okay?

14:06.304 --> 14:08.347
I'm ready to set up an intervention here.

14:09.516 --> 14:10.599
What?

14:10.934 --> 14:16.063
You do realize that interventions
typically don't involve binge drinking.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.524
Look, one drink.

14:19.692 --> 14:23.195
- Okay? Just one.
- When was the last time you had one drink?

14:27.617 --> 14:28.700
Communion.

14:33.665 --> 14:37.543
Megan! Megan. Wow! You look great!

14:38.211 --> 14:40.587
Do not speak.

14:41.631 --> 14:44.132
Okay. Two beers?

14:44.801 --> 14:46.218
Is she mad at me or something?

14:46.719 --> 14:49.972
She's not mad. That's how people act
when they're really into you.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.891
- Yeah.
- Excuse me?

14:52.976 --> 14:53.976
Oh!

14:54.060 --> 14:58.313
- Hello. Excuse me. Hi.
- Could you get a picture for us?

14:58.481 --> 15:01.400
Yeah, sure. I just push the button?

15:01.651 --> 15:03.694
- Turn it...
- You gotta go the other way.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.320
Beautiful.

15:05.655 --> 15:07.489
Save that for your collection.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.283
So, what are you girls drinking?

15:09.367 --> 15:10.867
- Mojitos!
- Mojitos!

15:11.202 --> 15:16.039
No, no, no, I'm not saying
there's anything wrong with any other city.

15:16.124 --> 15:18.875
I'm just saying that this
is the greatest city in the world.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.627
All right? I love this street!

15:21.296 --> 15:23.755
I love this street! Where are you guys from?

15:23.840 --> 15:25.424
- Miami.
- Miami.

15:25.633 --> 15:29.803
That was great. You did it in unison.
Miami. That's a big suck fest.

15:29.887 --> 15:33.265
No, this is the greatest city.
I don't know, like Barcelona, Rio,

15:33.349 --> 15:36.768
- they got nothing on this town.
- What are we doing? I'm freezing.

15:36.853 --> 15:38.770
- Hotel bar.
- Michael!

15:38.855 --> 15:39.938
Yeah.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.275
- Should have worn a coat.
- Michael!

15:47.614 --> 15:49.281
- It's warm in here.
- Get your hands off my car!

15:49.365 --> 15:50.324
What's your problem, asshole?

15:50.408 --> 15:52.159
- You'd be warmer if you snuggle up.
- Asshole!

15:52.243 --> 15:53.410
What the hell?

15:53.494 --> 15:55.746
- Get back in your car.
- Yeah?

15:56.372 --> 15:57.372
- What?
- Go back to Long lsland

15:57.457 --> 16:00.167
- where you come from.
- I'm from Queens, asshole!

16:00.251 --> 16:01.543
Shut the hell up, Yank.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.879
Why don't you go back
to England, huh?

16:03.963 --> 16:05.797
Hey, you wanna go back
to my hotel room?

16:05.882 --> 16:08.008
- That's my bloody guitar!
- Eat shit and die!

16:08.217 --> 16:09.551
Whoa!

16:16.392 --> 16:18.185
- Tyler...
- This is messed up.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.519
- I'm gonna go.
- Tyler!

16:19.729 --> 16:22.147
- Let's go...
- Lauren! Where are you going?

16:22.231 --> 16:24.107
- Come here!
- Don't walk over there.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.400
- Get off me!
- Lauren!

16:25.485 --> 16:27.694
- Get off of me!
- Oh, my God!

16:31.908 --> 16:33.033
Get off of me!

16:33.117 --> 16:35.035
Come on, now! Right now!

16:36.120 --> 16:37.579
Hold him down!

16:39.540 --> 16:41.541
No, I really think that it's done.

16:41.626 --> 16:43.710
- It's not bleeding as much.
- Here you go, ma'am.

16:44.128 --> 16:45.754
I hate New York!

16:46.297 --> 16:50.342
Listen, Officer, those two were with us.
They were just trying to stop it.

16:51.052 --> 16:54.137
Leo. Cut those two loose.

16:55.098 --> 16:57.265
Curly, turn around.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.602
- Anything in here gonna stab me?
- Nope.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.104
Get out of jail free.

17:02.772 --> 17:06.108
You're very, very lucky my partner
is on a tear.

17:07.568 --> 17:10.278
- How about you two?
- It wasn't us, man.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.906
- Take a hike.
- That scumbag kicked my car!

17:12.990 --> 17:15.200
- Shut up, genius.
- Eat shit, wanker!

17:15.284 --> 17:18.161
All right! That's it! Everybody's going!

17:18.246 --> 17:19.788
- What? You're bloody shitting me!
- Come on!

17:19.872 --> 17:21.790
- Hey! Hey!
- They attacked us!

17:22.709 --> 17:24.166
These two didn't do anything.

17:24.502 --> 17:27.295
- It was everything was these assholes.
- Hey, star witness, shut up!

17:27.380 --> 17:28.880
What are you still doing here?

17:30.591 --> 17:33.885
This is bullshit. These two guys
were just walking across the street.

17:33.970 --> 17:38.306
Well, Mr. Hawkins,
what makes you think I give a shit?

17:39.100 --> 17:40.392
'Cause you're a cop.

17:41.394 --> 17:44.938
- You're supposed to give a shit.
- You hear that, Leo?

17:45.022 --> 17:49.443
That's a great relief to me, Mr. Hawkins,
to know that you're on top of the situation.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.278
Now, go home!

17:51.487 --> 17:53.280
- Take a hike, fellas.
- Why don't you...

17:53.364 --> 17:54.448
What...

18:07.128 --> 18:09.880
Hey, pretty boy,
you ready to grab your ankles?

18:09.964 --> 18:11.506
Come here, sweet potato.

18:14.802 --> 18:15.927
You can have your call now.

18:16.012 --> 18:19.014
No, I'm good. I'm good.
Don't worry about it.

18:20.308 --> 18:22.058
- You all right?
- You're good?

18:22.852 --> 18:24.102
You're good?

18:24.187 --> 18:25.896
Okay. Now, thank God you're good.

18:26.355 --> 18:28.940
'Cause I wouldn't want you to get upset
about anything, like being in jail.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.400
I wouldn't want you to worry about that.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.154
You want to tell me what you were doing?

18:35.156 --> 18:38.283
I would like to know. You wanna tell me
what you wanted from that cop guy?

18:38.367 --> 18:40.410
Nothing. It was just a messed-up situation.
I mean...

18:40.495 --> 18:42.579
Yeah, I'll say.
It was frigging stupid, is what it was.

18:42.663 --> 18:46.625
These guys, you know, they're just pussies.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.543
You pussies!

18:49.754 --> 18:52.339
That's great. That's good.
Okay, Green Hornet... Lantern.

18:52.715 --> 18:54.216
Asshole!

18:56.260 --> 18:59.304
You know what? You might actually
be having a nice time

18:59.388 --> 19:03.266
not matriculating in school.
But I actually would like to graduate.

19:03.518 --> 19:05.894
It must be nice living
at the bookstore by yourself

19:05.978 --> 19:07.562
with all your stacks of books and all that,

19:07.647 --> 19:11.441
but, see, I actually plan on having a career,
and a wife, and a girlfriend,

19:11.526 --> 19:12.943
and, I don't know, a divorce

19:13.027 --> 19:15.821
and a mid-life stalking episode,
and erectile dysfunction.

19:15.905 --> 19:17.989
- Little bitch!
- Shut up!

19:18.074 --> 19:19.324
- Faggot!
- Asshole!

19:19.408 --> 19:21.535
- So I will thank you, as a friend...
- Shut up!

19:21.619 --> 19:25.163
...to keep your complexes
and your nihilistic bullshit to yourself!

19:25.748 --> 19:29.334
- Did you just say "nihilistic"?
- Yeah! All right? I got it off a cereal box!

19:29.418 --> 19:31.294
Hawkins. Hall.

19:32.672 --> 19:34.506
- Oh, you...
- Yeah.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.883
I called your dad. Sue me.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.052
- Good boy.
- We didn't do anything!

19:39.136 --> 19:41.096
Hey, nice to meet you.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.056
Is she looking for a roommate?

19:43.683 --> 19:45.100
In the city?

19:45.518 --> 19:46.601
Really?

19:47.645 --> 19:50.647
Hey, I gotta go, but I'll call you back.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.274
Okay. Bye.

19:59.615 --> 20:03.535
So, what'd you tell me
you were gonna do when things got tight?

20:05.454 --> 20:07.122
What, breathe?

20:07.790 --> 20:10.667
- Did you?
- I did. I'm breathing right now.

20:13.713 --> 20:16.172
- Who was that?
- Marie.

20:16.757 --> 20:17.799
Oh.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.802
- How is she?
- She's good.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.513
Mrs. Lippman's gonna drive me.

20:24.223 --> 20:26.266
No. I'll drive you.

20:40.656 --> 20:42.198
Hey.

20:45.286 --> 20:47.329
This drive is too long.

21:13.731 --> 21:15.941
You know you can't smoke in here.

21:18.819 --> 21:20.487
Why do you have an ashtray?

21:21.238 --> 21:24.074
It's a bowl. It completes the room.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.826
Good morning,
Hawkins, Stevens, Jacob.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.378
This is a bowl?

21:40.007 --> 21:41.800
- Well, I'm sorry.
- Tyler.

21:43.803 --> 21:46.096
I guess it was just here to tease me.

21:48.849 --> 21:51.017
- Hey, Janine.
- He's ready for you.

21:52.853 --> 21:54.729
- You okay?
- Yeah.

21:54.939 --> 21:57.107
- Really?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Janine.

21:57.191 --> 21:59.651
You look like hell,
and you smell like beer and cigarettes.

21:59.735 --> 22:02.404
- Thank you.
- You want me to lie to you?

22:03.030 --> 22:05.115
Try not to give him a heart attack.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.747
I only came to see how much it cost.
I'm gonna pay you back.

22:14.917 --> 22:18.461
- How much what costs?
- The lawyer.

22:18.546 --> 22:19.546
Ah.

22:22.091 --> 22:26.594
That lawyer, Tyler, costs $450 an hour.

22:26.679 --> 22:28.346
Oh, for Christ sake.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.890
Tell me about it.

22:33.894 --> 22:36.938
I just wanted you to know
that I didn't call you.

22:37.440 --> 22:38.565
It wasn't me.

22:39.817 --> 22:43.653
You could do worse
than have a father who bails you out of jail.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.864
That's not even...

22:49.201 --> 22:51.703
I don't want to be bailed out of anything.

22:51.787 --> 22:53.621
I'll get an invoice from Janine.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.806
Hey, Michael,

23:13.434 --> 23:15.143
remember that Greek myth you read to me

23:15.227 --> 23:18.605
about the god who banished
all his children to the underworld,

23:19.398 --> 23:23.902
and how his youngest son,
to get even, castrated him with a sickIe?

23:26.489 --> 23:28.239
It's a IittIe excessive, maybe,

23:30.034 --> 23:31.409
but I get it.

23:40.169 --> 23:41.961
You're so weird.

23:43.589 --> 23:46.674
Caroline, we have to go
to surgery right now.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.764
What did you do to your face?

23:53.599 --> 23:56.643
I had a horrible threshing accident.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.105
- It was horrible.
- It was so horrible.

24:00.189 --> 24:03.274
- The worst.
- You're so retarded.

24:06.237 --> 24:07.904
Hey, I got you something.

24:10.533 --> 24:12.283
This is my favorite book, ever.

24:12.368 --> 24:15.870
Michael used to hit me over the head
repeatedly with it until I read it.

24:16.455 --> 24:22.127
It's about all these gods and goddesses
who go around acting jealous and petty,

24:22.211 --> 24:24.462
and otherwise like regular human beings.

24:25.714 --> 24:29.384
- lllustrations are pretty cool.
- Yeah. These are cool.

24:30.761 --> 24:31.928
Thanks.

24:34.765 --> 24:35.765
Uh...

24:36.433 --> 24:38.726
- Where are we meeting Mom?
- The Guggenheim.

24:40.896 --> 24:42.772
What's up with these girls?

24:45.234 --> 24:46.901
They think I'm weird.

24:48.028 --> 24:50.321
Sometimes I sort of space out.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.908
What, when you're drawing?

24:55.202 --> 24:58.746
Yeah. Other times, too.

25:01.292 --> 25:05.753
Mademoiselle Fleishman had
to snap her fingers at me a lot today,

25:07.756 --> 25:09.757
and everybody laughed.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.636
They all think I'm a freak of nature.

25:14.805 --> 25:16.764
Mademoiselle Fleishman.

25:18.767 --> 25:22.604
Ma petite soeurette, une freak of nature.

25:26.692 --> 25:27.859
French toast.

25:27.943 --> 25:30.778
What are you gonna tell Mom
about your face?

25:31.530 --> 25:34.407
- "I finally found something I'm good at"?
- Really?

25:34.491 --> 25:35.950
- I have a class now.
- I know.

25:36.035 --> 25:37.702
- Are you listening? I have a class now.
- I know

25:37.786 --> 25:39.454
by all numerical measurements,
I didn't pass.

25:39.538 --> 25:42.874
But I was hoping that maybe you could
give me a grade on my trying-to-pass,

25:42.958 --> 25:45.251
my commitment to effort. It's...

25:45.753 --> 25:48.504
My commitment to commitment. You know?

25:49.131 --> 25:52.550
I don't... Look, I'm not... I mean...

25:52.635 --> 25:54.802
- Patricia. Can I call you Patricia?
- No.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.639
I... Life is about people and...

25:58.098 --> 26:03.102
And it's about what people put into people.
And I wanna put something into you.

26:03.187 --> 26:04.938
And I... Not... I don't wanna...

26:05.022 --> 26:08.566
I won't put anything into you. I just wanna...
You look great. I love that jacket.

26:08.651 --> 26:11.486
I will... I will say you're an angel, Patricia!
An angel!

26:15.741 --> 26:18.201
He has got a daughter!

26:19.787 --> 26:21.996
- Who's got a daughter?
- The cop!

26:22.873 --> 26:25.833
The cop that busted your face all up.
He's got a daughter.

26:26.794 --> 26:28.461
What do you want me to do? Kidnap her?

26:28.545 --> 26:31.547
Of course not!
We don't have closet space for that.

26:31.632 --> 26:35.343
Just introduce yourself.
You know, go on a few dates. I don't know.

26:35.427 --> 26:38.930
Be your charming, gentlemanly self,
and then flip the script on her.

26:39.014 --> 26:42.141
- What's "flip the script"?
- Screw her brains out.

26:42.226 --> 26:44.310
Make her call you Daddy, I don't know.

26:44.395 --> 26:46.813
Just steal her panties
and sell them on eBay,

26:46.897 --> 26:48.398
or post them on her high school's
home page.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.149
I don't know. Just be creative.

26:50.234 --> 26:53.820
Yeah, you should be incarcerated
just on general principle.

26:54.822 --> 26:58.574
- I was incarcerated. You might remember?
- Yeah.

26:58.659 --> 27:01.244
You tell me you don't wanna get back
at this asshole, and I'll drop it.

27:01.328 --> 27:02.495
Where's the trash?

27:03.580 --> 27:05.623
I don't wanna get back at this asshole.

27:05.708 --> 27:07.500
- Just meet her.
- I don't wanna meet her.

27:07.584 --> 27:09.252
- She's cute.
- I don't care.

27:09.503 --> 27:10.878
- You're meeting her.
- No, I'm not.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.297
- Yeah, you are.
- No, I'm not.

27:12.381 --> 27:13.548
Are, too.

27:14.341 --> 27:16.009
Look, just meet her.

27:18.220 --> 27:20.471
This is one of those things
that I'm already regretting.

27:20.556 --> 27:22.223
All right, she was here the other day.

27:23.183 --> 27:25.601
I don't care. What do you want me to say?

27:25.686 --> 27:28.104
"Hey, doll face, your dad trampled
all over my civil liberties.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.023
"You wanna make out with me?"

27:30.607 --> 27:32.358
Don't call her "doll face"!

27:32.901 --> 27:33.901
Moron.

27:33.986 --> 27:35.862
- Look, I'm leaving.
- Would you...

27:35.946 --> 27:38.114
Look. All right, there she is.

27:38.574 --> 27:40.241
- Who?
- The blonde.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.204
I know her. She's...

27:45.748 --> 27:49.375
I don't know her,
but she's in my global politics class.

27:49.835 --> 27:52.587
There you go! Something to open up with.
All right?

27:53.213 --> 27:54.297
Go get her.

28:06.935 --> 28:09.520
Excuse me? Can I bother you for a sec?

28:10.439 --> 28:12.440
You're already bothering me.

28:16.403 --> 28:19.614
Listen, I'm doing
this sociological experiment,

28:19.698 --> 28:22.075
and I was just wondering
if you could help me out for a second.

28:22.368 --> 28:24.285
You're kidding me, right?

28:25.454 --> 28:26.996
Can I ask your name?

28:29.124 --> 28:30.500
Anonymous.

28:30.584 --> 28:33.419
Anonymous. Is that Greek?

28:37.341 --> 28:38.716
Okay, Anonymous,

28:39.301 --> 28:41.761
you see the guy sitting over there,

28:41.845 --> 28:45.181
pretending to read a textbook,
looking in this general direction?

28:45.474 --> 28:48.768
Yeah, he's staring at us. Subtle.

28:49.228 --> 28:54.023
I have this theory that an objective
third party such as yourself

28:54.108 --> 28:57.860
could determine how much of an asshole
he is just by looking at him.

28:58.695 --> 29:02.990
See, I'm his roommate, and I think
I've witnessed too many glaring examples

29:03.909 --> 29:08.704
of assoholic behavior
that I'm biased as a subject.

29:09.415 --> 29:13.084
But I'm convinced that he has an aura
that you can actually perceive.

29:14.378 --> 29:16.295
Who else do you plan on asking?

29:17.548 --> 29:21.175
I don't know. I don't think anybody else
here fits the criteria.

29:22.136 --> 29:24.011
Attractive, early-twenties female...

29:24.096 --> 29:27.682
- Ah! Nineteen.
- Nineteen. I'm...

29:28.225 --> 29:31.185
That's fine. Teens. I can do teens.

29:33.188 --> 29:35.022
Okay.

29:37.151 --> 29:40.903
Well, typically, you get something
for being involved in one of these surveys.

29:40.988 --> 29:45.867
I ran out of my foam fingers
a while back, so...

29:47.077 --> 29:49.579
I don't know,
can I take you out to dinner or something?

29:51.290 --> 29:54.959
Or maybe just have a conversation
on the off-chance

29:55.335 --> 29:57.545
one of us says something interesting?

29:58.714 --> 30:03.342
Yeah, see, there is a problem, though,
because I don't date sociology majors.

30:03.427 --> 30:06.429
Lucky for you, I'm undecided. So...

30:08.307 --> 30:09.891
About what?

30:12.394 --> 30:14.145
Everything.

30:22.112 --> 30:23.404
I'm Ally.

30:25.616 --> 30:26.908
Ally.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.164
Don't be mad!

30:33.957 --> 30:38.252
Dad, we've seen Erin Brockovich
twice already. You cried both times.

30:38.545 --> 30:41.756
- I did not.
- It's embarrassing.

30:56.897 --> 30:58.731
- Hello?
- Hello.

30:59.441 --> 31:02.944
- Hey, it's TyIer.
- Hi.

31:05.447 --> 31:08.449
You're gonna stand me up. I can feel it.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.452
I can feel it in my bones.
I'm gonna be devastated.

31:11.537 --> 31:13.871
No, no... I was just...

31:15.207 --> 31:19.335
What? You were sitting around
watching TV in your sweatpants?

31:19.419 --> 31:21.045
No, I'm not watching TV.

31:21.129 --> 31:24.715
I am just getting dressed
and I'm gonna meet you at the place at...

31:24.800 --> 31:27.677
- What time again?
- 8:00.

31:28.971 --> 31:31.472
Right. 8:15. Okay.

31:33.392 --> 31:35.351
- Remind me.
- Ern Brockovich.

31:35.435 --> 31:37.228
Car accident. Not her fault, she says.

31:37.312 --> 31:39.313
Hey, I'm going out.

31:40.857 --> 31:42.775
I can see that.

31:43.485 --> 31:45.653
Well, you are a trained investigator.

31:47.322 --> 31:51.075
- Who are you going with?
- A boy from school.

31:52.327 --> 31:53.411
Okay.

31:56.206 --> 32:00.626
- I wasn't asking for permission.
- I know. Just have a good time.

32:02.629 --> 32:04.171
You want cab fare?

32:17.394 --> 32:18.853
Should I wait up?

32:34.703 --> 32:36.329
What desserts do you have?

32:41.918 --> 32:44.337
Mango ice cream with nuts and raisins.

32:44.421 --> 32:47.923
Great. I'll have that
and a glass of skim milk.

32:48.008 --> 32:51.886
And then the lamb vindaloo. Thanks.

32:55.057 --> 32:59.268
Can I have a chicken tikka masala
and a Kingfisher, please?

33:03.398 --> 33:04.899
I have my dessert first.

33:04.983 --> 33:05.983
Oh!

33:06.068 --> 33:08.319
Is that a political statement?

33:08.403 --> 33:12.073
Or a medical condition, perhaps?

33:13.116 --> 33:18.079
I just don't see the point in waiting.
What if I die eating my vindaloo?

33:22.084 --> 33:24.669
- Is that probable?
- It's possible.

33:24.753 --> 33:27.963
Embolism bursts,
asteroid hits the restaurant.

33:28.048 --> 33:32.009
I'd die without having eaten
the one thing I wanted most.

33:33.178 --> 33:38.140
- I mean, the odds are...
- Tell you what. Guarantee me,

33:39.142 --> 33:43.771
swear to me on your eternal soul
that I make it through my entree,

33:44.439 --> 33:45.773
and I'll wait.

33:47.484 --> 33:50.653
Before you answer, if I die,

33:51.321 --> 33:53.364
you're gonna have to live
the rest of your life knowing

33:53.448 --> 33:55.116
not only did you lie to me,

33:55.784 --> 33:59.495
but you denied me
of my one last indulgence.

34:00.080 --> 34:01.622
My last wish.

34:02.416 --> 34:06.043
Are you prepared to shoulder
that kind of responsibility to prove a point?

34:10.047 --> 34:11.799
Don't worry. I'll share.

34:16.304 --> 34:18.222
I had a nice time.

34:20.183 --> 34:21.350
Yeah?

34:23.353 --> 34:26.981
You had a nice time,
or you're having a nice time?

34:28.900 --> 34:31.652
'Cause if you're having a nice time,
why rush to end it?

34:34.739 --> 34:36.991
Take a shot. Three for one. $1 .

34:37.534 --> 34:39.618
Okay, come on. Win a prize.
Win a prize for the pretty lady.

34:39.703 --> 34:42.246
Yeah. I want the panda.

34:42.330 --> 34:43.289
How many do you need to get
for the panda?

34:43.373 --> 34:44.373
Three for three.

34:47.002 --> 34:49.003
- Let's go.
- I knew that.

34:51.339 --> 34:52.797
Almost.

34:55.342 --> 34:57.344
Yeah. Give me three more.

34:58.180 --> 34:59.346
lf I give up,

35:00.974 --> 35:02.266
he wins.

35:03.602 --> 35:07.438
- Who? The attendant?
- The giant freaking panda.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.274
Take it easy, tough guy.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.568
I'm sorry. All right, three more. Three more.
Let's do it.

35:12.652 --> 35:13.903
That's another $1 .

35:14.863 --> 35:17.072
Yeah, I don't know
what you're smiling about.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.700
I won.

35:20.076 --> 35:22.953
Paying off the attendant is not winning.
It's cheating.

35:25.207 --> 35:29.376
By the way, when were you gonna tell me
what the hell happened to your face?

35:33.548 --> 35:35.591
I just got into a bar fight.

35:36.843 --> 35:38.844
Do you want to go for a beer or something?

35:39.805 --> 35:43.098
No, wait, you can't. You're too young.

35:44.017 --> 35:45.392
I'm 21 .

35:46.102 --> 35:47.895
No, you're not. You're...

35:49.064 --> 35:50.314
Did you lie?

35:51.024 --> 35:53.567
- I was trying to get rid of you.
- Oh.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.950
That hurts. I'm wounded.

36:03.578 --> 36:07.581
Well, it's getting pretty late, so...

36:09.042 --> 36:10.167
I'll walk you to the subway.

36:10.252 --> 36:13.963
I'll take a cab.
I never take the subway anyway.

36:17.092 --> 36:18.425
Okay.

36:26.643 --> 36:28.185
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

36:33.275 --> 36:34.483
So...

36:37.571 --> 36:38.654
Uh...

36:41.575 --> 36:43.033
- Not tonight.
- Okay.

36:43.118 --> 36:45.703
Not never, just not tonight.

36:45.787 --> 36:48.330
- Are we going or what?
- Turn on the meter.

36:48.790 --> 36:50.583
"Not never"?

36:51.293 --> 36:55.421
So dessert first, for fear of asteroid, yes,

36:57.132 --> 37:01.969
but kissing a guy
you seem to be attracted to, at least,

37:02.971 --> 37:06.473
before driving off
into the unknown New York City night

37:06.558 --> 37:10.811
alongside a panda you only just met, no?

37:11.479 --> 37:12.688
Great.

37:20.614 --> 37:21.655
Good.

37:21.740 --> 37:24.825
- You're really weird.
- Yeah, I know.

37:25.160 --> 37:27.828
I'm going to Queens.
Don't wanna hear about it.

37:29.497 --> 37:33.292
HeIIo, this is Jackie Mason. BuckIe up...

37:45.305 --> 37:48.307
- Happy end of 6th grade!
- Finally.

37:54.314 --> 37:59.318
I got into that art program summer thing
at Steinhardt.

38:00.362 --> 38:01.654
Yeah, I heard.

38:02.322 --> 38:05.783
It's very prestigious,
due to my artistic greatness.

38:05.867 --> 38:07.034
Mmm...

38:07.911 --> 38:12.039
Don't pretend you're not proud.
You should be.

38:15.210 --> 38:19.421
- There's, like, a thing.
- A thing?

38:20.715 --> 38:23.717
A show where you show
what you've done and stuff.

38:25.345 --> 38:26.720
Will you come?

38:28.098 --> 38:29.223
Um...

38:30.350 --> 38:31.934
I'll have to check my book.

38:34.229 --> 38:37.064
Abso-freaking-lutely. What, are you insane?

38:37.148 --> 38:39.858
I'm gonna be there the day before.
I'm gonna camp out.

38:45.365 --> 38:47.741
Your school's over, right?

38:48.576 --> 38:50.786
Mom and Les are gonna get
the beach house again?

38:51.329 --> 38:52.538
Yeah.

38:53.957 --> 38:56.750
- What are we gonna do for your birthday?
- Nothing.

38:56.960 --> 38:59.420
- Can we have a party?
- No.

38:59.504 --> 39:02.381
A little one. At Mom's, with Aidan.

39:02.465 --> 39:06.844
- I'll make Mom behave. No crying.
- Like that's even possible.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.774
I know. We live like pigs.

39:21.609 --> 39:22.776
But

39:24.863 --> 39:27.781
I do have a coaster, if you want a coaster.

39:28.408 --> 39:30.409
Don't do coasters till the third date.

39:39.753 --> 39:41.170
Hey, who's that?

39:42.297 --> 39:44.173
That's Michael. That's my brother.

39:45.508 --> 39:47.509
He kind of looks like you.

39:47.969 --> 39:50.971
- Does he play around here?
- Not anymore.

39:54.184 --> 39:56.185
Do you play?

39:58.646 --> 40:00.355
Well, it depends who you ask.

40:01.149 --> 40:04.318
It turns out that you need talent.

40:05.987 --> 40:09.823
So, what talents
do you actually possess, Tyler?

40:12.535 --> 40:14.828
Not a lot. l, uh...

40:18.333 --> 40:21.251
I used to do a bit of falconry
when I was a kid.

40:21.836 --> 40:25.339
I mean, I come from a long line
of lrish falconers.

40:26.049 --> 40:27.132
No, there is...

40:27.217 --> 40:28.258
Oh!

40:28.343 --> 40:31.011
I don't know if this qualifies
as a talent, but...

40:32.180 --> 40:34.139
- What is that?
- This

40:35.350 --> 40:36.809
is our appetizer.

40:39.354 --> 40:42.022
I mean, it used to say, "In case of Asteroid,"

40:42.190 --> 40:45.943
but Aidan, my roommate, got high,
and I was in the shower.

40:47.821 --> 40:48.821
So...

40:59.624 --> 41:02.000
What kind of grade
did you get from Vogelstein?

41:03.086 --> 41:04.920
I don't really get grades.

41:05.755 --> 41:09.341
I'm not technically enrolled.
I just worked out this auditing thing.

41:09.425 --> 41:10.509
Huh.

41:10.927 --> 41:14.388
So the Strand isn't a significant
career choice, either?

41:14.556 --> 41:16.682
No, I just like the books.

41:18.977 --> 41:20.519
What are you doing?

41:21.479 --> 41:23.856
- You don't need to help me.
- Yeah, well, at the rate you're going,

41:23.940 --> 41:26.817
dishwashing's gonna be,
like, your life's vocation.

41:30.196 --> 41:31.238
What?

41:33.825 --> 41:34.825
Huh.

41:35.076 --> 41:38.912
So, this is the whole playful
"you get me all wet" part, right?

41:39.205 --> 41:43.542
- Why make it sound cheap?
- It is cheap. I've seen this scene 100 times.

41:44.586 --> 41:46.920
You know what never happens
in this scene, though,

41:47.005 --> 41:48.964
Tyler-who-doesn't-really-go-to-school?

41:49.048 --> 41:51.133
Tyler-who-doesn't-really-
care-about-his-job?

41:51.801 --> 41:53.969
- What?
- Nope?

41:58.933 --> 42:00.017
That.

42:06.900 --> 42:09.651
You better apologize!

42:09.736 --> 42:11.778
- Never!
- Apologize!

42:12.572 --> 42:16.241
Your middle name is Keats?
God, your parents are pretentious as hell.

42:16.326 --> 42:18.827
- You better apologize.
- Never!

42:19.454 --> 42:22.456
- Apologize!
- I'd rather eat monkeys!

42:22.665 --> 42:25.459
Oh, God. Not in the plans! Not in the plans!

42:40.516 --> 42:43.477
I surrender. I surrender. Jeez.

42:44.687 --> 42:45.979
You're relentless.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.862
- Victory at all costs.
- Oh, man...

42:55.657 --> 42:57.407
Now I'm pissed.

42:59.452 --> 43:01.328
You should quit anyway.

43:02.914 --> 43:06.625
Why is that?
Are cigarettes bad for you or something?

43:11.005 --> 43:13.465
Do you want a sweatshirt or something?

43:13.883 --> 43:16.176
I'm okay. Thanks.

43:19.514 --> 43:24.351
You know, the only time I ever smoked
was at the roller disco at the Y.

43:24.978 --> 43:28.021
I choked so bad,
Mr. Demmick gave me the Heimlich.

43:28.106 --> 43:31.775
On skates?
That's actually quite impressive.

43:31.859 --> 43:33.694
I never really thought of it that way.

43:35.863 --> 43:40.492
Tattoo, huh? Let me see. What is it,
like a Chinese character or something?

43:40.576 --> 43:42.286
'Cause I know this guy
who got a Chinese character,

43:42.370 --> 43:43.829
and he thought it said...

43:47.709 --> 43:50.877
Sorry. I didn't know.

44:00.138 --> 44:01.763
He killed himself.

44:08.021 --> 44:09.104
When?

44:12.608 --> 44:14.693
On his 22nd birthday.

44:17.071 --> 44:19.406
He'd just started working for my father.

44:21.909 --> 44:23.744
I thought he was a musician.

44:25.913 --> 44:27.414
Yeah, he was.

44:28.916 --> 44:34.963
But he wasn't making any money. And

44:37.425 --> 44:39.843
my dad's a pretty compelling guy.

44:41.929 --> 44:44.806
Yeah. So is mine.

44:48.978 --> 44:52.064
- Damn, you're not naked!
- You're not lrish.

44:52.815 --> 44:54.983
What the hell happened in the kitchen?

44:55.068 --> 44:58.570
It looks like somebody's water broke
in there. It's gross.

44:59.906 --> 45:02.783
- Hi.
- Hi.

45:02.909 --> 45:05.035
Aidan, this is Ally.

45:06.079 --> 45:08.997
- Ally, Ally...
- Ally, Aidan. This is my roommate.

45:11.125 --> 45:12.334
Nice to meet you.

45:14.087 --> 45:16.213
- I work out.
- You're the assoholic.

45:16.297 --> 45:17.964
Yeah. Well, I...

45:18.049 --> 45:19.257
Wait. What?

45:21.010 --> 45:23.970
Okay, "Around The World" party, third floor.
Come on, let's go.

45:24.055 --> 45:27.265
There's a whole lot of ugly,
but there's a lot more alcohol, so...

45:27.350 --> 45:29.184
Come on, let's go.

45:29.268 --> 45:31.019
Yeah, I would, I'd love to,
but I should get home.

45:31.104 --> 45:34.648
What? No, no, no.
All right, listen, listen, listen.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.316
Ally? Ally, Ally?

45:37.151 --> 45:38.360
One drink.

45:39.153 --> 45:42.114
Any country you want.
I'll even put France on the table.

45:42.990 --> 45:45.158
Come on. And then we'll go.

45:45.701 --> 45:47.119
One drink?

45:50.206 --> 45:53.291
- One drink?
- One drink.

46:01.676 --> 46:03.093
How are we doing?

46:04.595 --> 46:05.679
What?

46:06.722 --> 46:09.683
What? What do you want me to say?
You want me to say I'm sorry?

46:10.768 --> 46:13.645
You want me to apologize
for showing a nice girl a good time?

46:17.984 --> 46:20.360
- I'm sorry.
- Tyler,

46:22.488 --> 46:25.198
I need you to call my dad.

46:29.996 --> 46:33.123
Yeah, sure. Where's your phone?

46:39.881 --> 46:41.840
Ally, your phone's dead.

46:44.635 --> 46:45.969
Ally?

46:47.054 --> 46:48.430
What's his number?

46:51.893 --> 46:53.393
God damn.

46:56.814 --> 46:59.316
Do you think I give a shit how late it is?

46:59.400 --> 47:04.237
I know she's a smart girl, Leo.
She's supposed to be back. She's not back.

47:07.033 --> 47:09.409
Leo, don't go there. All right?

47:10.286 --> 47:13.747
I want... I want you to call Ted Proferes!

47:16.375 --> 47:18.084
Yeah. And call me back.

47:19.921 --> 47:21.546
God damn it, just do it!

48:05.174 --> 48:06.967
Oh, shit.

48:07.176 --> 48:08.176
Shit!

48:42.503 --> 48:44.671
I'm sorry. I fell asleep.

48:47.008 --> 48:48.842
Asleep where?

48:50.052 --> 48:51.886
My phone died, so...

48:54.181 --> 48:57.976
- That's mine. That's from my desk.
- I was trying to find some information.

48:58.269 --> 49:00.270
What am I now, one of your suspects?

49:00.354 --> 49:03.064
When you act like one.
Are you on anything?

49:03.149 --> 49:06.151
- Oh, for God's sake.
- Don't use that tone with me, Ally.

49:07.194 --> 49:09.029
I smell alcohol.

49:09.739 --> 49:11.239
Yeah, so do l.

49:13.159 --> 49:16.578
What's going on here, Ally? Are you trying
to tell me something with this?

49:16.662 --> 49:18.371
You're all grown up now?

49:18.581 --> 49:22.709
Yeah, maybe it's time you get used to it,
Dad, before you give yourself a heart attack.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.294
Who's the guy?

49:24.378 --> 49:27.881
- God, what makes you think there's a guy?
- Yeah, he's a real prince.

49:28.090 --> 49:31.384
He gets you drunk,
sends you home smelling like a brewery,

49:31.469 --> 49:33.595
smelling like God knows what.

49:34.221 --> 49:38.558
- You sure can pick them.
- Yeah, I take after my mother.

49:43.439 --> 49:47.400
- I'm not a child, okay?
- Hey! In this house, you are!

49:48.194 --> 49:49.402
You'd love that!

49:49.487 --> 49:52.030
You're pathetic! Would you strangle me
'cause you couldn't save Mom...

49:56.243 --> 49:57.911
Ally? Ally?

50:00.122 --> 50:02.082
Don't touch me! Don't...

50:15.930 --> 50:19.474
So, what? She just left? No goodbye?

50:21.394 --> 50:23.770
You were the one dumping
Jell-O shots down her throat.

50:23.854 --> 50:27.440
Hey, there are sins of omission
and sins of commission.

50:27.900 --> 50:31.111
I've forgiven myself, okay?
You should do the same.

50:31.779 --> 50:33.446
All right, here we go.

50:33.739 --> 50:36.116
Come on! Come on!

50:37.660 --> 50:40.120
Here we go! Here we go!

50:43.457 --> 50:45.500
Got it! Okay!

50:46.127 --> 50:47.877
Okay... Don't think I can...

50:47.962 --> 50:48.962
Crushing!

50:49.088 --> 50:52.924
It's crushing! I need a little help here! Tyler!

50:54.260 --> 50:56.761
- What the hell, man?
- It's penance.

50:57.471 --> 50:58.805
I'm going to work.

51:00.391 --> 51:01.599
Help!

51:01.892 --> 51:03.935
Well, if you had another one
of those protein shakes...

51:04.019 --> 51:07.313
Yeah, but it was freaking
crushing my sternum, you jackass.

51:13.279 --> 51:14.279
Hey.

51:21.162 --> 51:22.662
How's she doing?

51:25.541 --> 51:27.333
She's pretty shaken up.

51:31.505 --> 51:33.339
We need to fix that deadbolt.

51:34.258 --> 51:36.676
Yeah. That's my bad.

51:36.886 --> 51:40.013
Don't worry about it.
Do you think she's gonna sleep?

51:45.853 --> 51:48.271
You know, you realize
if she'd had the S.L.U.T...

51:51.525 --> 51:52.776
Is it too soon?

51:59.992 --> 52:03.077
I told her she can stay here.
Is that all right?

52:03.162 --> 52:07.999
- Yeah. As long as she needs.
- Thank you.

52:37.196 --> 52:38.571
You're up.

52:45.704 --> 52:48.581
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

52:53.420 --> 52:54.796
Aidan left.

53:03.430 --> 53:06.266
So, yeah, I'll be in here
if you need something.

56:07.781 --> 56:10.033
Thanks, honey. See you later.

56:15.414 --> 56:18.207
I can't believe you still come down here.

56:21.754 --> 56:24.380
I can't believe he still drinks that stuff.

56:24.465 --> 56:27.633
Well, you know how it goes.
You can take the kid out of Brooklyn...

56:28.719 --> 56:31.763
You're not writing anything bad about me,
are you?

56:31.972 --> 56:33.389
Not today.

56:34.850 --> 56:37.143
I gotta run. Early meetings.

56:39.271 --> 56:41.397
In case I don't see you before Saturday,

56:41.940 --> 56:43.483
happy birthday.

56:45.569 --> 56:47.862
I'll tell your father you said hello.

56:48.822 --> 56:50.156
Bye, doll.

56:54.161 --> 56:55.495
Bialy.

56:57.581 --> 56:58.915
Thank you.

57:01.335 --> 57:04.212
- Hey.
- Hey.

57:06.131 --> 57:10.259
- Where you been?
- Downtown, near Wall Street.

57:10.677 --> 57:14.430
- Why?
- I went to a coffee shop.

57:16.016 --> 57:17.683
I got you a bialy.

57:20.020 --> 57:22.480
Thanks. Yeah.

57:23.690 --> 57:26.192
You realize New York's
full of coffee shops?

57:27.653 --> 57:30.196
Yeah, it was me and Michael's place.

57:31.532 --> 57:34.617
We used to go there for breakfast
all the time.

57:35.369 --> 57:38.704
I mean, probably not as many times
as I think we did,

57:41.250 --> 57:42.667
but enough.

57:45.712 --> 57:48.339
We went there on the morning that...

57:50.217 --> 57:52.593
It was the last place I saw him.

57:53.804 --> 57:55.555
You go there to write to him?

57:58.517 --> 58:01.227
I just wanted to tell someone about you.

58:10.237 --> 58:12.697
My mom was murdered 10 years ago.

58:13.824 --> 58:17.243
You don't have to say anything.
You're sorry. I know.

58:18.871 --> 58:21.497
And my dad...

58:23.083 --> 58:26.878
My dad's the kind of guy
who needs to take care of people.

58:26.962 --> 58:29.714
I know that sounds kind of weird right now,

58:31.550 --> 58:33.259
but he's not that guy.

58:34.261 --> 58:37.597
You know, I trust him. I really do.

58:39.266 --> 58:41.017
And I just don't want you to think
that I'm here

58:41.101 --> 58:44.061
'cause he's some crazy, belligerent person.

58:45.981 --> 58:50.610
He just doesn't understand, or...

58:52.779 --> 58:57.241
I don't know, just doesn't know
what's going on right now.

59:03.832 --> 59:05.917
What's going on right now?

59:11.215 --> 59:12.715
I don't know.

59:23.268 --> 59:26.187
- Did you call dispatch to check?
- I...

59:26.271 --> 59:28.397
You're gonna have to testify to this!

59:28.482 --> 59:30.233
And they're gonna ask you,
"Are you sure of the time?"

59:30.317 --> 59:32.068
And you're gonna say what?

59:32.152 --> 59:34.487
- 8:15?
- Come on, you...

59:35.489 --> 59:37.823
- Neil.
- What?

59:42.871 --> 59:44.247
Hey,

59:45.040 --> 59:47.291
- Ally called Sharon.
- What?

59:47.918 --> 59:50.586
She said to tell you that she's with friends
and she's doing fine.

59:50.671 --> 59:52.505
- Which friends?
- She didn't say.

59:53.924 --> 59:55.132
That's all?

59:58.178 --> 01:00:00.179
Yeah. I'm sorry, buddy.

01:00:01.306 --> 01:00:03.432
Look, why don't you come out
for the weekend?

01:00:03.517 --> 01:00:06.477
We'll get the grill going.
Sharon wants to see you,

01:00:06.561 --> 01:00:08.271
- and we'll call some nice people up...
- No.

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:12.024
- Come out to Patchogue, Neil...
- No, Leo. Stop!

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:22.743
Make a wish!

01:00:31.712 --> 01:00:33.754
- Come on...
- All right!

01:00:33.839 --> 01:00:35.631
- Yeah!
- Big two-two!

01:00:35.716 --> 01:00:38.009
- Big 22!
- Yeah!

01:00:41.179 --> 01:00:43.556
- Wait... Right, two, three...
- Think one, two, three...

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.099
Look at her.

01:00:45.809 --> 01:00:49.895
- One, two, three...
- Tyler? I'm worried.

01:00:52.566 --> 01:00:55.943
I'm concerned her father
isn't gonna come to her show.

01:00:56.028 --> 01:00:58.404
Well, yeah. I'd be worried, too.

01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:02.325
I was hoping for some reassurance.

01:01:02.868 --> 01:01:06.370
- One, two, three...
- Spin. Got that.

01:01:06.455 --> 01:01:08.622
- She's gonna be heartbroken.
- Listen...

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:14.754
I'll get him there.

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:21.218
- You will? Really?
- Yeah, Mom. I'll get him there.

01:01:24.931 --> 01:01:27.433
- Thanks.
- Aidan. Aidan, get your...

01:01:28.018 --> 01:01:30.186
- One, two, three. One...
- Two, three...

01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:32.688
Get your filthy hands off my sister.

01:01:32.773 --> 01:01:34.106
Thank God.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.442
- Madame.
- Tyler.

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:41.614
So, you're actually the second member
of the family that I've washed dishes with.

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:43.741
Tyler?

01:01:45.285 --> 01:01:49.872
He's never washed a dish in his life.
He must have tried to impress you.

01:01:49.956 --> 01:01:50.956
Ah...

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:56.212
- He says you're in social work.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:01:56.296 --> 01:01:57.463
Did you go to school for that?

01:02:04.846 --> 01:02:07.139
They're afraid to move at all.
They're certainly not gonna come down.

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:08.724
That's why
they're gonna come down.

01:02:08.809 --> 01:02:11.018
Charles, it's your son.

01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:14.480
- What?
- He's on the phone.

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:23.739
Tyler, you're on speakerphone.

01:02:24.825 --> 01:02:28.494
- Yeah, I'm calling about Caroline's art show.
- What about it?

01:02:30.288 --> 01:02:31.539
Hold on.

01:02:37.504 --> 01:02:38.546
No.

01:02:39.381 --> 01:02:40.840
Yes. TyIer?

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:44.385
Yeah, I was wondering
if you wanted to have dinner beforehand.

01:02:44.469 --> 01:02:45.553
What?

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:48.389
Do you want to have dinner before?

01:02:48.849 --> 01:02:50.850
Yeah. Yeah, that would be fine.

01:02:51.685 --> 01:02:55.104
I'll have Janine make a reservation
somewhere nice, like the...

01:02:55.188 --> 01:02:56.188
I don't know, the Oak Room.

01:02:56.731 --> 01:02:59.024
No, that's not what I mean.

01:02:59.109 --> 01:03:00.359
How many?

01:03:03.155 --> 01:03:04.738
TyIer, how many?

01:03:07.868 --> 01:03:09.034
Three.

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:11.829
AII right. Three it is.

01:03:13.832 --> 01:03:15.791
It's 22 today, isn't it?

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:18.419
Yeah.

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:24.049
Happy birthday.

01:03:25.343 --> 01:03:26.802
Yeah, thanks.

01:03:37.647 --> 01:03:38.814
Enter.

01:03:39.900 --> 01:03:41.192
We're gonna go.

01:03:42.068 --> 01:03:43.736
Thanks for the party, Maestro.

01:03:44.571 --> 01:03:45.946
Did it suck?

01:03:47.908 --> 01:03:49.033
Ha, ha!

01:03:50.410 --> 01:03:52.077
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:53.914 --> 01:03:56.707
- I'll go and get us a cab.
- Okay.

01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:09.803
Wow!

01:04:17.604 --> 01:04:19.396
Can I see?

01:04:23.443 --> 01:04:25.277
That's exactly him.

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:30.032
It's like the cigarette's the last Coke
in the desert.

01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:39.124
- I can't believe he smokes in front of you.
- Don't worry, I'm not that impressionable.

01:04:42.671 --> 01:04:46.549
You know, when I was younger, we didn't
have air conditioning in the house,

01:04:47.175 --> 01:04:51.303
so during the summer, my mom and l
would go to museums to cool off.

01:04:51.388 --> 01:04:54.640
She loved them all,
but the Met was her favorite.

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:58.602
Yeah. The Met's one of my favorite places

01:04:58.687 --> 01:05:00.229
- in the world.
- Yeah?

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:03.148
So, you've got an art exhibit coming up?

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:06.151
Yeah.

01:05:07.445 --> 01:05:09.321
You mind if I come?

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:15.202
I mean, I understand
if you don't want some random girl there.

01:05:16.162 --> 01:05:19.915
You're not random.
You're Tyler's girlfriend.

01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:29.008
And while we must devote

01:05:29.092 --> 01:05:30.593
enormous energy to conquering disease,

01:05:30.677 --> 01:05:34.054
it is equaIIy important
that we pay attention to the moraI concerns

01:05:34.139 --> 01:05:38.434
raised by the new frontier
of human embryo stem ceII research.

01:05:38.518 --> 01:05:41.979
Even the most noble ends
do not justify any means.

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:45.691
Embryonic stem ceII research offers both
great promise and great periI...

01:05:51.615 --> 01:05:53.616
Have you ever been
to the Oak Room before?

01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:57.870
Oh, yeah. I come here all the time
with my dad and his bowling buddies.

01:06:00.707 --> 01:06:03.709
He can stand me up,
but he can't stand you up.

01:06:05.754 --> 01:06:08.088
And he can't stand my sister up.

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:14.637
- Can I get another whiskey, please?
- Give me the same, Sean.

01:06:14.721 --> 01:06:16.847
- Laphroaig. Neat.
- Yes.

01:06:17.098 --> 01:06:20.309
- And for the lady?
- I'm still good. Thanks.

01:06:32.947 --> 01:06:37.868
Alyssa Craig, this is my father,
Charles Hawkins. Ally.

01:06:37.952 --> 01:06:40.913
- It's a pleasure.
- Pleasure.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:50.756
So, you're going to be a social worker?

01:06:51.257 --> 01:06:55.135
Yeah. But with a focused area
of responsibility.

01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:59.515
- Makes it easier to get a job.
- I see. What area is that going to be?

01:07:00.100 --> 01:07:02.851
- Criminal justice.
- That's a...

01:07:04.020 --> 01:07:05.771
That's a tough area.

01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:10.442
When I was a kid,
I wanted to play shortstop for the Mets.

01:07:10.527 --> 01:07:12.319
I don't think it's any harder than that.

01:07:12.404 --> 01:07:13.654
The Mets!

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:17.199
I'm from Queens.

01:07:17.742 --> 01:07:21.870
My father's a Yankees fan.
It has something to do with the payroll.

01:07:22.497 --> 01:07:25.249
It has something to do
with significant ball-playing.

01:07:25.333 --> 01:07:26.500
Right.

01:07:26.876 --> 01:07:29.545
You were a Yankees fan
when you were little.

01:07:29.629 --> 01:07:32.131
You were Lou Piniella for Halloween.

01:07:34.843 --> 01:07:37.136
Just blind familial allegiance.

01:07:38.138 --> 01:07:43.308
That's before I knew what overpaid, overfed,
fat bastards they were.

01:07:45.645 --> 01:07:49.148
Who's fat? What Yankee is fat? Tell me.

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:52.151
It's a metaphor.

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:58.449
Roger Clemens.

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.249
Luis Sojo.

01:08:10.545 --> 01:08:12.045
Shane Spencer.

01:08:12.338 --> 01:08:13.922
He's big-boned.

01:08:28.854 --> 01:08:30.229
Dessert now?

01:08:31.566 --> 01:08:35.277
- Does this still count as your entree?
- People can change.

01:08:35.361 --> 01:08:37.738
So how long has your dad been a cop?

01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:40.365
Twenty-two years.

01:08:42.535 --> 01:08:43.660
Would you excuse me?

01:08:45.287 --> 01:08:46.747
I'm so sorry.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:54.046
Hey. It's just a phone call.
At least he waited till dessert.

01:08:54.671 --> 01:08:58.133
You're killing me.
Look, you're killing me right now. Okay?

01:09:03.348 --> 01:09:08.310
- I'm so sorry. And your mother?
- She passed away when I was 11 .

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:14.983
She was murdered, and I was there.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.615
I never mentioned that part.

01:09:26.537 --> 01:09:28.663
Why are you saying this now?

01:09:30.124 --> 01:09:31.582
I don't know.

01:09:32.417 --> 01:09:35.921
And here you are.

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:39.925
Here I am.

01:09:46.933 --> 01:09:48.642
He's not so bad.

01:09:49.018 --> 01:09:50.352
Oh, God.

01:09:54.064 --> 01:09:55.524
No, don't say it.

01:09:56.067 --> 01:09:58.277
I've got to go to the office.

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:02.948
- Listen, the exhibit runs till 9:00.
- No, you have somewhere else to be.

01:10:03.032 --> 01:10:06.493
- You guys take my car, and I'll...
- I don't believe you!

01:10:07.287 --> 01:10:10.497
- That's all there is, Tyler.
- That's all there is?

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:12.916
That's all there is?

01:10:13.001 --> 01:10:15.544
Take the car. I'll get a cab,
and I'll meet you there.

01:10:15.628 --> 01:10:20.132
It's not enough.

01:10:24.304 --> 01:10:25.846
Do I actually look like that?

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:28.390
Oh, no.
It was probably just the lighting.

01:10:29.475 --> 01:10:32.311
I brought you every single flavor.

01:10:34.647 --> 01:10:36.648
I'm ready to go home now.

01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:41.361
Ally.

01:10:49.412 --> 01:10:52.164
God, Tyler? Can we at least talk about this?

01:10:53.249 --> 01:10:55.292
Where are you going to go right now?
And what are you gonna do

01:10:55.376 --> 01:10:58.670
that's actually gonna help anything?
Do you really think...

01:10:59.672 --> 01:11:01.882
You better look after yourself for an hour.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:04.968
Are you capable of doing that?

01:11:23.446 --> 01:11:27.616
Are you guys telling me you get the call
at 6:00, and I don't get it till 8:00 tonight?

01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:30.535
Now, I don't know what's going on,
but someone's dropped the ball here...

01:11:30.620 --> 01:11:32.746
- Tyler!
- Mr. Hawkins!

01:11:33.081 --> 01:11:34.665
It's fine, Janine. It's fine.

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:38.043
She drew you a picture. She drew you
a picture, and you didn't come.

01:11:41.047 --> 01:11:42.798
Put it on the table.

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:49.596
You have a daughter who sincerely believes
that you don't like her.

01:11:51.391 --> 01:11:54.726
I mean, she's trying to communicate.
She's speaking.

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:59.773
But why aren't you listening?
I mean, why aren't you

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:02.401
riveted?

01:12:03.111 --> 01:12:07.447
Why is this not the most important thing,
just for one night?

01:12:08.408 --> 01:12:09.408
Tyler.

01:12:09.534 --> 01:12:13.036
- We can come back.
- No, it's fine. Sit down. Sit down. It's okay.

01:12:18.584 --> 01:12:20.460
Who's this display for?

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.839
It's for you.

01:12:25.758 --> 01:12:28.176
She knows I'll take care of her.

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:29.344
And?

01:12:30.138 --> 01:12:34.057
- We really can come back another...
- Sit the fuck down! Now!

01:12:37.270 --> 01:12:39.980
And that I love her. I love her.

01:12:41.858 --> 01:12:46.528
Good God, you toss that word around,
but you have no idea what it means!

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:48.113
Maybe I don't.

01:12:48.781 --> 01:12:52.951
- And maybe Caroline doesn't, either.
- I have provided her world, and yours.

01:12:53.036 --> 01:12:56.413
That doesn't mean you can just shatter it
whenever you feel,

01:12:56.497 --> 01:12:58.540
whenever there's something better to do!

01:12:58.624 --> 01:13:00.042
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

01:13:00.126 --> 01:13:02.419
You pedaled down here on your bike,
for Christ's sake!

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:07.257
You gotta take care of nothing!
You're responsible for no one! You're a kid!

01:13:07.341 --> 01:13:10.302
You think you're the first one
to lose anything?

01:13:10.386 --> 01:13:15.557
You think that whatever you feel
in your heart, I don't also feel it in mine?

01:13:19.353 --> 01:13:21.146
You didn't find him.

01:13:21.606 --> 01:13:23.231
See, I found him.

01:13:25.318 --> 01:13:29.362
And you're so just tragically blind

01:13:30.531 --> 01:13:34.826
that the rest of your children
are gonna hang themselves on your watch.

01:13:34.911 --> 01:13:37.454
You little piece of... Come over here,
I'm gonna smack you.

01:13:37.538 --> 01:13:39.289
- What? What?
- No. No!

01:13:39.373 --> 01:13:42.167
Tyler! Get out of here! Get out of here!

01:13:48.007 --> 01:13:50.675
God, there's no frigging air in here!

01:13:58.976 --> 01:13:59.976
Hey!

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:07.526
Hey.

01:14:07.902 --> 01:14:09.069
Hey. Hey.

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:12.989
Come here. It's okay.
It's okay, baby. Come here.

01:14:13.074 --> 01:14:17.160
It's okay, baby. Baby, it's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:17.286 --> 01:14:19.329
It's okay. Okay?

01:14:23.251 --> 01:14:24.251
It's okay.

01:15:07.128 --> 01:15:09.421
Dad, it's me.

01:15:11.090 --> 01:15:14.384
I just wanted to Iet you know
I'm okay, and...

01:15:15.386 --> 01:15:17.596
I'm going away for Labor Day.

01:15:19.098 --> 01:15:23.602
Yeah, weII, I hope you're good,
and I'II taIk to you sometime.

01:15:23.936 --> 01:15:25.562
Okay. Bye.

01:15:30.818 --> 01:15:33.195
Dad, it's me.

01:15:34.697 --> 01:15:38.450
I just wanted to Iet you know
I'm okay, and...

01:15:39.202 --> 01:15:41.077
I'm going away for Labor Day.

01:15:58.512 --> 01:16:00.055
Second word.

01:16:02.767 --> 01:16:04.893
- Long-armed?
- Trunk?

01:16:04.977 --> 01:16:06.311
Breathing?

01:16:07.355 --> 01:16:09.189
- Referee?
- Direction?

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:12.567
- The wall... The wall.
- High?

01:16:12.652 --> 01:16:15.487
You're climbing over the wall.
Over the hill...

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:33.171
I want a girlfriend.

01:16:34.757 --> 01:16:38.134
- What?
- Dinners out. Movies.

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:40.470
Regular sex.

01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:45.517
I could handle that for, like, a summer.

01:16:46.143 --> 01:16:49.104
- You're such a romantic.
- Yeah, damn right.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:52.232
I've been romantic with all the races.

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:56.903
- Excuse me?
- I have planted my flag in every continent.

01:16:59.282 --> 01:17:03.034
- So, white girl.
- Please. It's like falling off a log.

01:17:04.578 --> 01:17:05.620
Asian.

01:17:08.249 --> 01:17:09.374
Um...

01:17:09.750 --> 01:17:12.460
- Eskimo.
- Next stop, Patchogue.

01:17:12.545 --> 01:17:15.213
- No!
- Monica lmpellie.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:18.425
She works at the public library
on 96th Street.

01:17:18.509 --> 01:17:21.636
- You slept with an Eskimo?
- You went to the library?

01:17:23.139 --> 01:17:25.348
- I don't believe you.
- Fine.

01:17:25.725 --> 01:17:27.642
- She's a nice girl.
- Prove it. 10 bucks.

01:17:27.727 --> 01:17:29.936
- You wanna go to the library?
- The second we get off this train.

01:17:30.021 --> 01:17:31.730
- Fine.
- Are you coming?

01:17:32.148 --> 01:17:34.733
No, I'm gonna skip
this particular bloodbath, thank you.

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:36.484
Leo. You're off duty.

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:38.361
Station stop is Patchogue.

01:18:53.437 --> 01:18:54.938
Where is she?

01:18:56.732 --> 01:19:00.902
- What are you doing in my house?
- Where is my daughter?

01:19:03.489 --> 01:19:05.323
She's at the library.

01:19:10.246 --> 01:19:11.746
Does she know?

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:18.420
- No.
- No, I didn't think so.

01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:23.174
I figured you'd probably leave it up to me

01:19:24.260 --> 01:19:26.302
when you're done with her.

01:19:27.888 --> 01:19:29.806
I'm not going anywhere.

01:19:30.808 --> 01:19:34.352
Boy, that's true. Tyler Hawkins.

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:38.440
Son of Charles and Diane.

01:19:39.191 --> 01:19:42.652
Brother of Caroline and Michael, deceased.

01:19:44.029 --> 01:19:46.406
Suicide by hanging.

01:19:49.285 --> 01:19:51.536
You're kind of lost, aren't you?

01:19:51.829 --> 01:19:58.293
Take a little vacation in coach
before finding your way back to first class?

01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:03.506
You think you know me,

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.800
but you don't.

01:20:07.887 --> 01:20:09.554
But I do know you.

01:20:11.557 --> 01:20:13.141
I know you got nothing.

01:20:15.561 --> 01:20:19.022
I know you threw away the one person
that gave a shit.

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:22.942
Now you wanna blame me. That's all right.

01:20:24.570 --> 01:20:26.237
But you know what?

01:20:27.698 --> 01:20:30.867
I did the whole thing for a bet anyway.

01:21:19.124 --> 01:21:21.000
Get a fucking deadbolt!

01:21:55.202 --> 01:21:58.621
Tyler Keats Hawkins!
You are never gonna believe this!

01:21:59.164 --> 01:22:00.748
He banged an lnuit!

01:22:00.833 --> 01:22:05.587
And she's really nice and really smart,
and I really don't get it.

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:14.012
What's wrong?

01:22:16.015 --> 01:22:17.682
Your dad was here.

01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:20.018
Wait... What?

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:24.564
- Your dad was here when I got home.
- Shit.

01:22:25.024 --> 01:22:27.442
Shit! Okay, what did he say?

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:32.739
I know him.

01:22:35.117 --> 01:22:38.328
He arrested me and Aidan before I met you.

01:22:39.538 --> 01:22:42.540
The gash on my eye?
That was him.

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:48.046
I don't really understand.

01:22:48.130 --> 01:22:52.050
I mouthed off to him and he responded.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:57.555
And then Aidan saw you guys at school,

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:01.476
so he suggested that

01:23:02.436 --> 01:23:04.562
I introduce myself to you.

01:23:13.572 --> 01:23:14.989
I feel sick.

01:23:21.413 --> 01:23:33.925
Ally.

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:38.721
- What are you doing?
- What does it look like?

01:23:41.225 --> 01:23:43.476
But you don't need to do that.

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:47.271
Do you even realize what you've done?

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:52.652
Ally.

01:23:55.739 --> 01:23:58.658
I mean, did you really think
I would never find out?

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:02.745
I had to find out eventually.
You set it up that way.

01:24:04.623 --> 01:24:07.959
Ally, it doesn't mean anything.
It's not a big deal.

01:24:08.711 --> 01:24:12.755
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- That's exactly what you meant to do.

01:24:25.519 --> 01:24:28.479
You had to tell her eventually, man.

01:24:33.444 --> 01:24:34.986
She'll be back.

01:25:19.698 --> 01:25:24.118
You're not supposed to use that
on nonstick pans.

01:25:25.954 --> 01:25:27.914
It takes off the Teflon.

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:31.542
You gotta let it soak.

01:25:32.169 --> 01:25:33.252
Okay.

01:25:35.589 --> 01:25:37.465
I'm gonna...

01:25:46.809 --> 01:25:50.895
- I don't feel so good.
- Oh, come on. It's supposed to be fun.

01:25:53.148 --> 01:25:55.566
You know, maybe if you tried
to meet people halfway, you know,

01:25:55.651 --> 01:25:57.902
put a little bit of effort in?

01:25:58.987 --> 01:26:01.405
lf you tried to grow up a little?

01:26:01.865 --> 01:26:03.074
Maybe...

01:26:05.869 --> 01:26:07.203
Caroline.

01:26:09.748 --> 01:26:11.958
Emily. Emily! Come on, the door.

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:13.334
- Happy birthday.
- Hi, sweetie.

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:15.711
- Can you hold on a second? Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:26:15.796 --> 01:26:19.715
Thanks. Okay. Come on in, sweetie.
Come on in. The party's right in there.

01:26:20.884 --> 01:26:25.137
Yeah. I know. I need ice. lce. Yeah.
Napkins would be good.

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:28.516
Oh, wait! Liz has gotta find her.

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:30.351
Yeah.

01:26:45.951 --> 01:26:49.453
- I didn't do this for you.
- Thanks, dude.

01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:52.039
- Where's my big guy?
- Oh, my God!

01:26:52.124 --> 01:26:53.374
Oh, no.

01:26:57.838 --> 01:27:00.840
- Jim! I got here a little early.
- Get out!

01:27:00.924 --> 01:27:03.926
- I'll wait in the car.
- Go, Dad! Oh, my...

01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:07.638
- Who is that? Is that your dad?
- Yeah...

01:27:08.849 --> 01:27:10.266
So, I'm just..
I'm not embarrassed.

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:11.809
I am!

01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:19.859
Mom? I'm okay.

01:27:20.694 --> 01:27:22.820
Don't panic. I'm gonna be fine.

01:27:22.905 --> 01:27:25.531
- I just need you to come get me right away.
- You've gotta get over here.

01:27:25.616 --> 01:27:27.742
Someone cut a chunk
out of this little girl's hair.

01:27:27.826 --> 01:27:28.951
Come quickly.

01:27:48.221 --> 01:27:50.765
Hi. Is...

01:27:53.685 --> 01:27:56.062
Alyssa Craig, does she live here?

01:27:56.813 --> 01:27:59.023
Okay. Great. That's... I'm...

01:27:59.650 --> 01:28:01.943
You think I don't remember you?

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:05.529
- No, sir.
- Who is it?

01:28:10.953 --> 01:28:12.286
It's okay.

01:28:19.336 --> 01:28:21.128
So, what do you want?

01:28:24.383 --> 01:28:26.801
Look. I'm a prick. You know? And...

01:28:26.885 --> 01:28:27.969
And?

01:28:29.137 --> 01:28:30.221
Dad!

01:28:31.473 --> 01:28:32.848
Look, Tyler's not.

01:28:32.933 --> 01:28:34.892
- Look, I...
- Would you just wait?

01:28:35.227 --> 01:28:37.144
Shit! All right, I'm not...

01:28:37.229 --> 01:28:40.106
I'm not any good at this. All right?
It's not my thing.

01:28:40.732 --> 01:28:42.692
He lied to me. Big time.

01:28:44.528 --> 01:28:46.404
He's in love with you.

01:28:48.573 --> 01:28:51.784
I have only seen him look at one other girl
the way he looks at you.

01:28:52.035 --> 01:28:54.912
And she's a lot shorter and shares his DNA.

01:28:55.747 --> 01:28:58.249
You don't have to forgive him today.

01:28:59.459 --> 01:29:01.085
Just forgive him.

01:29:02.754 --> 01:29:03.921
Yeah. She's pretty traumatized.

01:29:04.006 --> 01:29:06.549
- No! I'm trying.
- I wanted to pull some names together

01:29:06.633 --> 01:29:08.175
in case we all decided
she should talk to someone.

01:29:08.260 --> 01:29:09.927
I just talked to her. No.

01:29:10.012 --> 01:29:12.722
- Diane's pretty upset, too.
- That's what I'm trying to tell you.

01:29:12.806 --> 01:29:15.474
No, the girls are saying
Caroline did it to herself.

01:29:15.559 --> 01:29:17.560
- But it's not true!
- Yeah.

01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:19.895
All of them.

01:29:19.980 --> 01:29:22.106
"...he sang almost as beautifully."

01:29:22.315 --> 01:29:25.192
It didn't happen
on school property, so...

01:29:25.777 --> 01:29:28.946
"When he was grown, he left his mother..."

01:29:29.031 --> 01:29:31.532
The school's not gonna do anything.

01:29:31.616 --> 01:29:34.618
Yeah, they're probably
gonna get away with it.

01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:37.455
"...and his eight loving aunts,

01:29:38.540 --> 01:29:41.042
"and he went to live
in his father's kingdom of Thrace

01:29:41.126 --> 01:29:46.213
"to bring the joy of music to earth.
His voice rang so pure and true

01:29:46.298 --> 01:29:49.633
"that the fiercest warriors
put down their swords

01:29:49.718 --> 01:29:52.970
"and savage beasts
lay spellbound at his feet."

01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:56.140
You give me the word
and I will steal their bikes.

01:29:58.894 --> 01:29:59.977
Ally.

01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.151
It's so sweet of you to come.

01:30:27.005 --> 01:30:29.340
It's my last one ever. I swear.

01:30:39.643 --> 01:30:40.976
Look, I...

01:30:41.686 --> 01:30:44.021
I know you're not here for me.

01:30:46.942 --> 01:30:48.442
And I don't...

01:30:52.864 --> 01:30:55.449
Just thank you for being here anyway.

01:31:05.377 --> 01:31:08.462
And for what it's worth,
I think you're amazing.

01:31:17.222 --> 01:31:19.181
How is she? Huh?

01:31:19.724 --> 01:31:21.225
She's asleep.

01:31:54.342 --> 01:31:57.136
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:31:57.220 --> 01:31:58.220
All right.

01:31:58.763 --> 01:32:01.891
Did you do something different
with your hair? I love it.

01:32:01.975 --> 01:32:02.975
Yeah, it's beautiful.

01:32:04.102 --> 01:32:07.021
Okay.
Okay, that's enough. Enough!

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:18.365
Excuse me! What are you doing? Stop!

01:32:40.639 --> 01:32:43.224
Hawkins. You posted.

01:33:03.495 --> 01:33:06.830
Destruction of private property.
Felony trespassing.

01:33:07.666 --> 01:33:09.750
- I didn't call you.
- I know you didn't.

01:33:09.834 --> 01:33:12.836
I have unleashed a raging shit storm
of epic proportions

01:33:12.921 --> 01:33:15.339
on the board of trustees
of that pissant school

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:18.425
that will not abate until those girls
seek enrollment elsewhere.

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.219
I give them a week.

01:33:22.681 --> 01:33:25.975
I know you think I'm a prick,
but I have my uses.

01:33:30.272 --> 01:33:33.524
Can you come by the office
and talk to the lawyers?

01:33:37.862 --> 01:33:38.988
Okay.

01:33:40.824 --> 01:33:44.243
Try not to vandalize any more schools
in the meantime.

01:33:47.497 --> 01:33:50.165
- Thanks for bailing me out.
- No problem!

01:34:07.225 --> 01:34:09.143
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:34:13.315 --> 01:34:16.233
Hey, using your little sister is dirty pool.

01:34:20.155 --> 01:34:21.697
Is it working?

01:34:28.121 --> 01:34:29.288
Maybe.

01:35:09.537 --> 01:35:13.332
Hey.

01:35:14.959 --> 01:35:17.169
I gotta go to my dad's office.

01:35:18.880 --> 01:35:20.672
Say hi to him for me.

01:35:23.718 --> 01:35:25.094
I love you.

01:35:26.513 --> 01:35:27.638
Good.

01:35:29.182 --> 01:35:30.808
I love you, too.

01:35:35.897 --> 01:35:38.816
Hey, French toast or pancakes?

01:35:39.901 --> 01:35:43.153
- It doesn't matter.
- French toast.

01:35:54.165 --> 01:35:57.668
- Hey. Good morning.
- What are you doing here?

01:35:57.752 --> 01:35:59.378
Well, Tyler's coming by the office,

01:35:59.462 --> 01:36:02.923
and I just thought
I'd ride to school with Caroline.

01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:06.343
- Is that okay?
- Okay. Sure.

01:36:07.178 --> 01:36:08.804
- Yeah. Great.
- Good. Good.

01:36:08.888 --> 01:36:10.097
- All right...
- She's not ready, though.

01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:12.933
- Don't worry about it. That's okay.
- She's gonna need at least 20 minutes.

01:36:13.017 --> 01:36:15.811
- I'll wait. I'm here, right downstairs.
- Okay.

01:36:16.020 --> 01:36:17.020
Okay.

01:36:21.276 --> 01:36:23.902
Are you running late,
or are you canceling altogether?

01:36:23.987 --> 01:36:25.946
Are you already on your way?

01:36:26.030 --> 01:36:27.656
I'm already here.

01:36:28.199 --> 01:36:30.409
I'm taking Caroline to school.

01:36:33.830 --> 01:36:35.038
Okay.

01:36:37.083 --> 01:36:38.625
I'll wait in your office.

01:36:39.252 --> 01:36:43.714
- It may be a while.
- That's okay. That's fine.

01:37:00.565 --> 01:37:03.650
- Is Janine in?
- She went for coffee.

01:37:03.735 --> 01:37:05.486
She getting me any?

01:37:06.321 --> 01:37:07.779
Just kidding.

01:38:56.931 --> 01:39:00.183
You're bad. Dirty girl.

01:39:00.268 --> 01:39:03.895
What? Of course I was gonna call you!
You didn't think I forgot about you?

01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:05.939
How could I forget you?

01:39:10.945 --> 01:39:12.279
Good morning, ladies.

01:39:12.363 --> 01:39:14.531
Good morning, Miss Giglio.

01:39:14.616 --> 01:39:16.033
Settle down.

01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:25.334
Good morning, Mr. Hawkins.

01:39:25.835 --> 01:39:30.005
- Do you know about these?
- Who do you think scanned all the pictures?

01:39:37.055 --> 01:39:38.472
Look at you.

01:39:43.394 --> 01:39:45.187
How old would he be?

01:39:47.774 --> 01:39:49.900
He would've been 28 in May.

01:39:50.443 --> 01:39:53.528
It's really been that long?
I could've sworn...

01:39:55.239 --> 01:39:57.449
It was May 20, 1995.

01:39:59.035 --> 01:40:02.037
I should be able to remember that. I'm sorry.

01:40:08.419 --> 01:40:09.920
It's all right.

01:40:15.593 --> 01:40:17.511
What a day.

01:40:39.909 --> 01:40:42.619
Caroline? Hello?

01:42:06.078 --> 01:42:09.498
Whatever you do in life
wiII be insignificant,

01:42:13.044 --> 01:42:15.712
but it's very important that you do it,

01:42:16.130 --> 01:42:21.176
because nobody else will.

01:42:25.014 --> 01:42:27.724
Like when someone comes into your life,

01:42:28.184 --> 01:42:31.686
and half of you says,
"You're nowhere near ready,"

01:42:33.731 --> 01:42:35.690
but the other half says,

01:42:36.901 --> 01:42:38.902
"Make her yours forever."

01:42:50.039 --> 01:42:51.373
Michael,

01:42:53.084 --> 01:42:55.919
Caroline asked me what I would say

01:42:57.213 --> 01:42:59.381
if I knew you couId hear me.

01:43:02.176 --> 01:43:03.885
I said I do know.

01:43:07.014 --> 01:43:08.473
"I love you."

01:43:12.019 --> 01:43:13.854
"God, I miss you."

01:43:17.859 --> 01:43:19.526
"And I forgive you."
