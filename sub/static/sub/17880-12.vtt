We're in it now. Ted. Go big or go home.

00:47.294 --> 00:48.317
I can go home?

00:48.442 --> 00:50.690
That stage is your home. Go.

00:56.364 --> 00:58.265
<i>So how did I get here?</i>

00:58.927 --> 01:00.335
<i>Because I like a girl,</i>

01:01.292 --> 01:02.768
<i>specifically this girl.</i>

01:03.082 --> 01:05.488
<i>And like so many stories about a girl,</i>

01:05.613 --> 01:07.650
<i>this one starts with gunplay.</i>

01:12.670 --> 01:15.158
Ok, fellas. What are we looking at here?

01:15.416 --> 01:17.962
This is the new unbreakable dinnerware
we've been developing.

01:18.087 --> 01:20.026
It's made from our new polymer, yo.

01:20.751 --> 01:23.332
When you talk like that, it just makes you whiter.

01:24.209 --> 01:26.502
- How much does this weigh?
- 8 pounds, 4 ounces.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.258
- 8 pounds?
- 4 ounces.

01:28.504 --> 01:31.871
I know I asked for an unbreakable dish,
but it doesn't have to take a bullet.

01:32.144 --> 01:34.113
What kind of dinner parties do you go to?

01:34.405 --> 01:35.895
Show me a lighter version.

01:39.956 --> 01:42.810
- We've disappointed him.
- No one would want to be us now,

01:42.978 --> 01:45.054
and since we are us, it's very difficult.

01:45.806 --> 01:46.694
Agreed.

01:50.357 --> 01:52.586
- Where are we on the...
- unbreakable dinnerware?

01:52.711 --> 01:54.609
- It's not really...
- Well, then just...

01:54.734 --> 01:56.614
- I don't think we've to go that far.
- Good,

01:56.739 --> 01:58.445
- but make sure...
- I will.

01:59.143 --> 02:01.761
We have worked together so long, we have a shorthand,

02:01.886 --> 02:03.525
an understanding, a trust.

02:05.114 --> 02:08.832
I saw this Veridian commercial that
said they're greening their buildings.

02:08.957 --> 02:11.255
Sure. The company does a lot of good things, like...

02:12.183 --> 02:14.489
- Greening their buildings?
- There's one.

02:14.990 --> 02:17.216
They also have stopped their logging operations.

02:17.341 --> 02:19.026
Because they ran out of trees.

02:19.836 --> 02:20.899
What do you want?

02:21.024 --> 02:23.785
I was hoping maybe I could work
with the group doing our building.

02:24.103 --> 02:27.255
I was reading this stuff about
roof gardens. They're amazing.

02:27.380 --> 02:29.648
They can cut air conditioning costs by 30%.

02:29.933 --> 02:33.637
Plus, our roof would look 70% prettier,
so that's 100% right there.

02:34.293 --> 02:35.200
Please?

02:35.692 --> 02:37.511
Well, the math seems sound.

02:38.467 --> 02:42.203
- Let me clear it with Veronica.
- Really? Excellent. Thank you.

02:45.653 --> 02:47.673
Sorry. That was just platonic...

02:47.798 --> 02:50.086
- Oh, yeah, I got that.
- 'cause I've a boyfriend...

02:50.317 --> 02:52.733
- 'Cause you weren't interested in me.
- It wasn't you.

02:52.858 --> 02:55.382
Why bringing this up? Just go get me my garden.

02:57.469 --> 02:59.398
There is no program to green the building.

02:59.523 --> 03:01.121
They made a commercial about it.

03:01.695 --> 03:04.090
I didn't say there wasn't a commercial

03:06.441 --> 03:08.771
So it's all a lie?

03:09.708 --> 03:11.558
They prefer to look at it as a dream.

03:12.255 --> 03:14.155
But one they're not working towards.

03:14.348 --> 03:16.695
Are you working toward all of your dreams, Ted?

03:18.633 --> 03:20.116
Then stop pointing fingers.

03:24.330 --> 03:27.109
How am I gonna tell Linda the one
Veridian project she believes in

03:27.234 --> 03:28.393
is all a big lie?

03:28.831 --> 03:31.085
She sometimes has a problem with what we do here.

03:32.029 --> 03:34.557
If we make this, it could kill all the world's fish.

03:34.682 --> 03:36.470
But, boy, does it whiten teeth.

03:36.595 --> 03:39.765
- All the world's fish or just...
- Why are we even talking about this?

03:42.813 --> 03:45.206
There she is. I'm just gonna tell her the truth.

03:47.010 --> 03:47.776
Well?

03:48.610 --> 03:49.812
You're in.

03:50.389 --> 03:52.898
- Or completely lie to her.
- Really? That's fantastic.

03:53.269 --> 03:54.984
It's a dream come true.

03:58.636 --> 04:00.158
I didn't see anything.

04:01.276 --> 04:05.471
The rest of the team is working
on other really good green projects,

04:05.596 --> 04:07.986
so you're gonna do the roof garden by yourself.

04:08.232 --> 04:10.541
- Wow. That's a lot of work.
- So don't do it.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.871
- I want to do it.
- All right.

04:13.295 --> 04:14.894
But you can't tell anybody .

04:15.019 --> 04:17.548
The company has classified this as confidential.

04:18.137 --> 04:20.634
But it's a good thing. Why does
it need to be confidential?

04:21.964 --> 04:24.986
Because, uh, if only bad things were confidential,

04:25.111 --> 04:28.309
When there's something "confidential,"
people would know it was bad

04:28.786 --> 04:30.644
- That's weird.
- I know. So don't do it.

04:31.243 --> 04:32.356
I want to do it.

04:32.670 --> 04:34.231
Good. Welcome to the team...

04:35.342 --> 04:36.490
Which is only you.

04:39.401 --> 04:43.073
So I lied. But you saw that face.
Who wouldn't lie to that face?

04:47.701 --> 04:49.191
Look at all this stuff.

04:50.353 --> 04:52.395
All right, guys. Let's get it on the roof.

04:52.520 --> 04:54.248
<i>Plus, I figure if she's successful,</i>

04:54.373 --> 04:57.528
I can sell it as a prototype for all Veridian buildings.

04:57.653 --> 04:59.360
Welcome to the big city, fellas.

05:00.688 --> 05:03.189
So what's the deal?
Are you guys fighting or having sex?

05:03.314 --> 05:05.988
I know. One always follows the other.

05:08.260 --> 05:10.994
To fund the project, I had to move some money around.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.416
I've never done anything like that before,

05:13.541 --> 05:15.459
but people do it all the time, right?

05:15.584 --> 05:18.898
At a company this big, no one
ever notices where the money is.

05:19.023 --> 05:22.488
Ted, I've noticed some money's missing,
and I need to know where it is.

05:25.521 --> 05:29.059
Do you know where the money is?
Because the company loves its money.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.989
The money, it's not missing.

05:32.427 --> 05:35.190
- Good. Then where is it?
- Well, it's...

05:37.252 --> 05:40.108
It's been moved to...

05:43.199 --> 05:44.842
The Jabberwocky project.

05:45.223 --> 05:46.220
Jabberwocky?

05:46.781 --> 05:48.389
You know about Jabberwocky?

05:49.521 --> 05:51.475
You're higher up the chain than I am.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.729
It's going to revolutionize the way we do business.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.493
- Don't tell me you don't know about...
- Of course I know about Jabberwocky.

06:00.618 --> 06:02.729
It's gonna revolutionize the way we do business.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.875
You obviously know more about it than I do.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.130
And I always will. Keep me posted.

06:10.112 --> 06:11.793
There's no Jabberwocky project.

06:12.146 --> 06:14.658
I don't normally lie to Veronica. In fact, I never do.

06:14.783 --> 06:16.625
But I had to cover the lie I told Linda.

06:16.827 --> 06:19.160
Jabberwocky?
What the...

06:19.852 --> 06:21.271
Veronica didn't question me

06:21.396 --> 06:24.944
'Cause the worst thing that can happen
is to be out of the loop.

06:25.135 --> 06:27.691
<i>If you're out of the loop, you're out of a job.</i>

06:28.401 --> 06:29.815
You wanted to see me, Chet?

06:29.940 --> 06:32.407
There's some money missing from your department.

06:32.642 --> 06:33.776
It's not missing.

06:33.901 --> 06:36.030
It's been moved to the Jabberwocky project.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.904
Yes. That's right.

06:41.119 --> 06:42.016
I see.

06:45.093 --> 06:47.266
You do know about Jabberwocky,

06:48.182 --> 06:49.125
don't you?

06:49.460 --> 06:51.826
Of course I do. I just didn't know that you knew.

06:52.366 --> 06:54.793
How could I not know? It's in my department.

06:56.302 --> 06:57.355
Isn't it?

06:57.664 --> 06:58.484
Exactly.

06:59.605 --> 07:01.636
So we both know what it is.

07:02.584 --> 07:04.484
Yes. We do.

07:06.575 --> 07:07.436
Don't we?

07:08.803 --> 07:10.405
Yes, we do.

07:15.984 --> 07:19.057
Ted, we now have a plate that weighs less than 5 ounces.

07:19.182 --> 07:21.607
And it's still unbreakable.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.859
- Watch.
- You can't fire a gun in here.

07:25.083 --> 07:26.906
Alan ruined that for everybody.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.447
But check this out.

07:32.793 --> 07:34.077
Yqou were right.

07:34.371 --> 07:36.770
That polymer could burst into flames on high impact.

07:36.895 --> 07:38.306
You owe me a smoothie.

07:41.069 --> 07:43.474
I'm going to leave this here.

07:45.073 --> 07:46.471
Sorry about that, Kathy.

07:46.823 --> 07:49.351
But better than that time Alan shot at you, right?

07:50.622 --> 07:52.987
I'm gonna have to pull the plug
on this thing.

07:53.181 --> 07:54.013
Wait.

07:55.352 --> 07:57.559
What if we could come up with a use for a burning plate?

07:58.013 --> 08:00.180
A plate you could also cook your food on.

08:00.305 --> 08:03.069
- A plate that is also a stove.
- Aplove.

08:04.249 --> 08:07.319
Yeah, I don't think so. Everyone goes through a slump.

08:08.959 --> 08:11.105
Did you hear that? Now he thinks we're in a slump.

08:11.230 --> 08:13.518
Oh, god. My mom's gonna be so upset.

08:13.817 --> 08:15.541
She hates when we disappoint Ted.

08:15.947 --> 08:18.676
- You don't have to tell her everything.
- You don't know her.

08:18.801 --> 08:20.427
She gets things out of you.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.953
It's revolutionize the way we do business.

08:27.078 --> 08:28.669
I gotta get on this Jabberwocky thing.

08:28.794 --> 08:30.765
My wife is pregnant again. I need a winner.

08:30.890 --> 08:32.429
I'll put in a good word for you.

08:32.554 --> 08:35.207
- You're on Jabberwocky?
- Cleared half my schedule for it.

08:35.332 --> 08:36.966
It's a freakin' game-changer.

08:37.434 --> 08:40.001
Just once in my career, I'd like to change a game.

08:40.380 --> 08:43.414
Oh, man, this lie is spreading
like mayonnaise at a baptist picnic.

08:44.958 --> 08:47.485
This is crazy. I haven't gotten anything done all day.

08:47.610 --> 08:50.070
Everyone just keeps pestering me to get on Jabberwocky.

08:50.238 --> 08:53.532
- I was talking to Brett and...
- I'm going through a tunnel.

08:53.700 --> 08:54.867
I'll call you back.

08:55.320 --> 08:57.452
Listen, Veronica, I need to tell you something.

08:57.730 --> 09:01.609
Hey, guys. Isn't this a great day?
I am so happy.

09:03.304 --> 09:05.169
I need to tell you that she is so happy.

09:05.970 --> 09:08.839
- Can I borrow him for a second?
- She needs to borrow me for a second.

09:09.578 --> 09:12.558
I wish I had the power to make everyone go away.

09:12.683 --> 09:14.100
Oh, wait. I do.

09:22.474 --> 09:23.663
Here, taste this tea.

09:23.788 --> 09:25.180
- Why?
- Just taste it.

09:26.392 --> 09:28.817
- How do you like it?
- I don't know. It tastes like tea.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.184
- It's made from urine.
- God.

09:34.443 --> 09:35.866
Don't worry. It's safe.

09:36.507 --> 09:39.105
It's safe, but it's also made from urine.

09:39.719 --> 09:41.319
You need to work on your flirting.

09:41.444 --> 09:44.211
Larry in engineering gave me
this water purification system,

09:44.336 --> 09:47.453
and I've been talking to people about
things we can do to green the building.

09:47.959 --> 09:50.121
You're supposed to be working on the confidential.

09:50.246 --> 09:52.298
- Don't take on any more than that.
- Why not?

09:52.423 --> 09:55.207
Why not? Why not? You remember Alan?

09:57.360 --> 09:59.723
Remember how much he tried to take on? Think about it.

10:03.149 --> 10:06.252
- Why aren't we on Jabberwocky?
- We need to be on it.

10:07.936 --> 10:10.246
Oh, I thought we decided to go with aggressive.

10:11.564 --> 10:13.904
All right, I give up. I gotta tell you the truth.

10:15.780 --> 10:18.367
- There's no Jabberwocky.
- Don't give me that crap!

10:19.786 --> 10:21.944
Too aggressive. Felt it as soon as it came out.

10:22.069 --> 10:24.213
I'm telling you, it doesn't exist. I made it up.

10:24.338 --> 10:25.238
Come on.

10:25.458 --> 10:28.574
When my mom hears you didn't put
us on it, she's gonna change the locks.

10:28.699 --> 10:31.547
Guys, there's no such thing as...
Wait, your mom knows about it?

10:32.064 --> 10:34.627
He tells her everything, Ted. It's a sickness.

10:37.451 --> 10:39.388
He's cutting us out. Because we failed him.

10:39.513 --> 10:42.467
- We need to make him believe in us.
- Agreed.

10:42.592 --> 10:45.742
- It's nice to see you calm.
- I hated what I was turning into.

10:50.101 --> 10:52.956
Jabberwocky was getting out of control. I had to kill it,

10:53.666 --> 10:55.881
<i>the best way to kill a rumor is with another rumor.</i>

10:56.006 --> 10:58.639
Keep this to yourself, I hear
it's not a game-changer at all.

10:58.764 --> 11:01.062
I hear it's a game-staying-the-samer.

11:01.899 --> 11:04.551
Total career-killer. People can't leave it fast enough.

11:05.827 --> 11:07.195
Don't go anywhere near it.

11:07.320 --> 11:09.239
I'm telling you this 'cause I like you...

11:09.364 --> 11:11.569
<i>Unfortunately, Jabberwocky had gotten too big.</i>

11:11.694 --> 11:13.678
<i>It's like trying to kill a bear with a chopstick.</i>

11:13.803 --> 11:16.550
<i>I'm not saying it can't be done,
it's just super-duper hard.</i>

11:17.824 --> 11:20.717
And so we're looking for a way to make
Ted feel good about us again

11:20.842 --> 11:22.165
Any ideas?

11:22.518 --> 11:24.700
I don't know. Buy him a candle.

11:25.341 --> 11:28.220
That's not gonna fly. Ted hates
things that light on fire.

11:28.345 --> 11:30.492
- Ted likes Linda.
- You wanna give him Linda?

11:30.617 --> 11:33.025
I wasn't thinking that, but...

11:34.229 --> 11:36.069
I will be given to no man!

11:38.286 --> 11:40.365
I saw that in a movie once.

11:41.193 --> 11:42.079
Nothing.

11:42.636 --> 11:45.571
What if we just help her with
whatever project she's working on?

11:45.696 --> 11:47.868
Yeah, Ted might appreciate us doing that.

11:50.797 --> 11:52.568
Say, Linda, what are you working on?

11:52.693 --> 11:54.409
Oh, you're talking to me again.

11:54.922 --> 11:58.050
Well, I'm not supposed to tell anyone,
but I could use some help.

11:59.697 --> 12:01.490
I'm building a roof garden, and I need

12:01.615 --> 12:04.001
a super energy-efficient way to light it at night.

12:04.126 --> 12:06.689
- Have you considered a plove?
- No, forget the plove.

12:06.980 --> 12:08.739
What about bioluminescence?

12:08.864 --> 12:11.819
Fireflies have been using it for 200 million years.

12:11.944 --> 12:15.002
Fireflies... the flaming plates of the insect world.

12:25.201 --> 12:26.095
Thank you.

12:27.194 --> 12:29.879
You don't have to thank me every time I say "hello,"

12:30.327 --> 12:31.750
but it's nice to hear.

12:32.224 --> 12:33.210
Ok. Do it.

12:33.718 --> 12:37.622
No, I mean, I love this project.
I'm not supposed to say anything,

12:37.747 --> 12:41.218
- but I really appreciate it.
- So you're working on it, too.

12:41.603 --> 12:43.832
- Day and night.
- I see.

12:44.787 --> 12:46.581
Then tell me, Linda, how's it going?

12:46.706 --> 12:48.545
Specifically. Tell me anything.

12:48.670 --> 12:51.421
Even the littlest thing would be great to hear.

12:51.546 --> 12:55.232
Well, the worms are thriving, and I got Ted to drink urine.

13:03.440 --> 13:05.742
Hi, ted. Just trying to get to know you better.

13:06.346 --> 13:07.828
By going through my files?

13:08.519 --> 13:10.100
You're such a closed book.

13:12.238 --> 13:14.688
I don't know what Jabberwocky is.

13:15.145 --> 13:16.986
It's the most exciting project,

13:17.111 --> 13:20.298
and all I know is that it involves worms and urine.

13:25.543 --> 13:26.997
There is no Jabberwocky.

13:27.564 --> 13:29.349
- What?
- I made the whole thing up.

13:30.388 --> 13:31.768
You lied to me?

13:32.108 --> 13:33.354
I know. It was wrong.

13:34.439 --> 13:37.274
I needed to move some money around
so Linda could build her roof garden.

13:38.129 --> 13:40.594
A roof garden? Oh, for God sakes, Ted.

13:40.719 --> 13:42.195
Why don't you do her already?

13:42.454 --> 13:46.305
Do you know what trouble we're in now?
This is all they're talking about.

13:46.665 --> 13:50.265
In a couple of hours, we're presenting it to the division.

13:50.390 --> 13:52.660
What? Why'd you agree to that?

13:52.785 --> 13:54.441
Really, is that your strategy,

13:54.566 --> 13:57.421
let's make this Veronica's fault? You're the only person I told.

13:57.887 --> 14:00.434
Wow. It is your strategy. That is so thin.

14:00.559 --> 14:03.060
All right, let's not panic.

14:03.185 --> 14:06.091
Why don't we tell them that Jabberwocky is Linda's project?

14:06.216 --> 14:09.648
'Cause they don't care about greening
the building. It's not gonna happen.

14:09.980 --> 14:13.298
- How am I gonna tell that to Linda?
- Why don't you start like this?

14:13.423 --> 14:16.396
"Hey, Linda, can I borrow some money?
'cause I just lost my job."

14:17.046 --> 14:19.171
You're right. Why are we even talking about Linda?

14:19.296 --> 14:21.247
We have to focus on this presentation.

14:21.607 --> 14:24.362
We need to come up with a product
that no one has ever seen before.

14:24.956 --> 14:27.813
And it better be good. They've already
signed a contract with James earl Jones

14:27.938 --> 14:30.069
to be the voice of...
Jabberwocky.

14:34.780 --> 14:36.345
<i>So here we go again.</i>

14:36.627 --> 14:39.603
<i>Because of a girl, I'm about to lie to 2,000 people.</i>

14:42.025 --> 14:44.777
We're in it now, Ted. Go big or go home.

14:44.902 --> 14:45.988
I can go home?

14:46.113 --> 14:48.225
That stage is your home. Go.

14:57.719 --> 15:01.547
Business is changing... changing
at the speed of information.

15:02.155 --> 15:03.606
Whoever adapts first...

15:03.986 --> 15:05.085
Wins.

15:05.210 --> 15:08.082
In order to compete, we innovate.

15:08.207 --> 15:10.698
In order to innovate, we redefine.

15:10.823 --> 15:12.410
And how do we redefine?

15:14.247 --> 15:17.253
<i>With a new definition. Jabberwocky.</i>

15:21.125 --> 15:22.345
This is going great.

15:22.470 --> 15:24.508
Imagine if we'd come up with a product.

15:24.633 --> 15:27.206
Products are for people who don't have presentations.

15:29.288 --> 15:34.305
Imagine a new way to do business
that's faster than a cheetah...

15:34.665 --> 15:36.570
More powerful than...

15:37.594 --> 15:38.771
Another cheetah.

15:39.981 --> 15:42.504
I only had an hour to pull stuff off the Internet.

15:43.112 --> 15:46.783
A way of doing business more magnificent than...

15:47.222 --> 15:48.337
A fish.

15:49.115 --> 15:50.323
Or a whale.

16:05.699 --> 16:08.091
<i>Sure, there were a few hiccups...</i>

16:14.923 --> 16:17.309
<i>But not having a product
wasn't slowing us down at all.</i>

16:17.434 --> 16:18.711
So what is it?

16:18.836 --> 16:22.522
What is it exactly that's gonna
revolutionize the way we do business?

16:24.037 --> 16:26.200
<i>Simple. It's...</i>

16:26.489 --> 16:27.624
<i>Jabberwocky!</i>

16:33.831 --> 16:36.399
The game is changing right now.

16:36.524 --> 16:38.038
Coming in 2012.

16:45.466 --> 16:47.556
So do you understand what Jabberwocky is?

16:47.681 --> 16:50.117
Of course I do, you idiot. Don't you?

16:50.242 --> 16:53.786
Yeah. I was just seeing
if you needed me to explain it to you.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.078
I love being applauded.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.749
If I had a tape of that,
I'd fall asleep to it every night.

17:00.874 --> 17:03.906
It was a great evening, although
I'm still angry about the flash pop.

17:04.046 --> 17:05.660
That would've looked so cool!

17:05.785 --> 17:08.137
Ted, don't ever lie to me again.

17:09.218 --> 17:10.948
I'm sorry. I won't.

17:11.944 --> 17:13.536
Too many people get hurt.

17:13.832 --> 17:17.410
The next thing you know, you're buying
James earl Jones an muffin basket.

17:18.473 --> 17:20.536
And you're not a very good liar, anyway.

17:21.753 --> 17:24.121
But that's ok.
Neither am I.

17:27.019 --> 17:28.984
Now that's how it's done.

17:36.302 --> 17:38.431
<i>There are a lot of bad things about lying.</i>

17:39.789 --> 17:41.540
<i>But the worst thing</i>

17:41.665 --> 17:43.574
<i>is when you have to tell the truth.</i>

17:43.699 --> 17:45.522
So this project never existed?

17:47.108 --> 17:49.025
Then this whole thing was pointless?

17:49.351 --> 17:50.462
No, it wasn't.

17:51.110 --> 17:53.646
Look around. Look how beautiful this is.

17:54.557 --> 17:55.615
You did this.

17:55.908 --> 17:58.108
You made a difference right on this rooftop.

17:59.963 --> 18:01.333
I hope you're not upset.

18:03.714 --> 18:05.375
You stole from the company for me.

18:05.696 --> 18:07.836
How could a girl be mad
at someone that does that?

18:07.961 --> 18:10.422
You're like my thief in shining armor.

18:14.761 --> 18:17.507
If we're gonna hug, you're starting it.

18:22.702 --> 18:23.758
Good evening,.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.815
- I was past the greeting.
- Don't.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.651
We were working with Linda on this project,

18:31.919 --> 18:33.788
and we are about to light up this rooftop

18:33.913 --> 18:35.947
without using a single watt of electricity.

18:36.072 --> 18:38.241
- Impossible, you say?
- I didn't say anything.

18:38.595 --> 18:39.481
It's not!

18:41.312 --> 18:43.913
Behold the power of biolunescence.

18:49.043 --> 18:51.301
Guys... it's so pretty.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.358
We took the plants' d. N. a.,

18:53.483 --> 18:55.932
spliced in the bioluminescent properties of fireflies.

18:56.057 --> 18:58.320
We call them... Fireflowers.

18:58.961 --> 19:01.222
Nice work, fellas. I'm impressed.

19:01.632 --> 19:03.127
- Really?
- Yeah. In fact,

19:03.252 --> 19:05.727
The company might be interested
in something like this.

19:06.963 --> 19:08.790
- We're back.
- And we're proud.

19:12.571 --> 19:13.609
What was that?

19:15.490 --> 19:16.639
A fire-squirrel.

19:22.298 --> 19:26.206
<i>A week later, we found another benefit
of Linda's roof garden,</i>

19:26.667 --> 19:28.994
<i>although the fire-squirrel turned out to be a mistake...</i>

19:29.119 --> 19:32.372
<i>Driven mad by not being able to sleep
due to its constant glowing.</i>

19:35.446 --> 19:37.392
<i>As for the Jabberwocky project,</i>

19:37.727 --> 19:40.424
<i>we never did have to figure out what the hell it was.</i>

19:44.024 --> 19:47.084
<i>Because after our presentation,
the company was so excited,</i>

19:47.209 --> 19:49.441
<i>they fast-tracked it and shipped it to Japan.</i>

19:50.180 --> 19:51.337
<i>Jabberwocky.</i>

19:52.642 --> 19:56.611
<i>What they shipped, I'm still trying to figure out...</i>

19:57.073 --> 19:59.008
<i>And so are the japanese.</i>
