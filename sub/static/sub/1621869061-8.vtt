You sure that's okay, man?

00:45.336 --> 00:46.463
Why wouldn't it be?

00:46.546 --> 00:50.759
Well, uh, I'm pretty sure it's exactly
what we're not supposed to do, right?

00:51.760 --> 00:52.677
According to who?

00:53.636 --> 00:55.722
-Everyone.
-We're outside.

We've just disinfected

We're safe, all right?
Don't freak out, man.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.812
That's what they want you to do.

-The government.

Can you at least put your mask back on?

[reporter 2] Even as we see
the H5G9 numbers skyrocket,

04:28.643 --> 04:32.522

[narrator] The thing that should have
brought us together

Gus, come on, man. Come back!

[Bear] He's not out front, either.

You get turned around real easy.

Everything you've been told
your whole life is one big lie.

05:03.553 --> 05:06.472
I don't know, man. Maybe
we shouldn't have brought him here.

05:06.556 --> 05:10.018
No, we did the right thing.
There's nothing worse than not knowing.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.436
That never goes away.

05:12.729 --> 05:14.522
[Bear] Did you have any idea?

05:14.605 --> 05:15.440
No.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.776
Didn't have "test-tube baby"

05:19.986 --> 05:22.238
Did you see the dates on those photos?

05:24.449 --> 05:26.617
Gus was born way before the others.

05:27.410 --> 05:28.453
Yeah, I noticed.

05:30.997 --> 05:32.665
-What if…
-Don't say it.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.003
What if Gus was the first?

05:38.921 --> 05:40.423
Yeah, but why do you think they did it?

05:41.007 --> 05:44.052
Why did they make
a deer-kid baby, in a lab?

05:45.345 --> 05:46.596
To see if they could.

05:48.181 --> 05:50.058
Anyway, does it even change anything?

hybrids were a miracle of nature.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.222
I'll track down Gus.

Hell no. I'm coming with you.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.143
Someone needs to wait here
in case he comes back.

06:37.355 --> 06:38.231
Fine.

your own little chapter
in the history books one day, Ms. Eden.

10:50.608 --> 10:54.528
How that chapter ends,
that's entirely up to you.

Does the name "Laika"
mean anything to you?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.871
She was a lucky dog,

11:05.081 --> 11:07.750

for our sweet little Laika,

have traveled to the stars.

And did I mention
I have brought a few friends?

11:46.872 --> 11:49.667
There are only two goals
when it comes to these little freaks:

11:50.418 --> 11:53.254
extermination and experimentation.

11:53.337 --> 11:54.380
The problem is,

11:54.463 --> 11:58.092
if you're really, really good
at the extermination part,

11:58.175 --> 12:01.178

nowhere near the numbers we need

12:01.262 --> 12:03.723

And look how I turned out.

29:05.034 --> 29:06.286
I'd keep this stuff.

That's all you got of your dad.

29:12.167 --> 29:13.168
I don't have one.

29:15.503 --> 29:16.796
I don't have anyone.

29:18.923 --> 29:19.758
Just me.

29:25.263 --> 29:27.515
I never should have crossed the fence.

29:28.057 --> 29:30.560
I should have just stayed in the woods.

29:30.643 --> 29:32.645
None of this would have ever happened.

None of what?

Everyone wants to kill me.

29:44.657 --> 29:46.075
Everyone lies.

29:48.703 --> 29:50.163
Well, he did his best.

29:52.040 --> 29:54.584
Then why couldn't he
just tell me the truth?

29:54.667 --> 29:55.835
Being honest

29:57.253 --> 29:58.922
is hard sometimes.

30:00.006 --> 30:04.594
All that stuff back in the attic, at least
we know one thing he said was true.

30:05.136 --> 30:06.387
You're a special kid.

30:07.180 --> 30:10.475
I don't want to be special.
I want to be like everyone else.

30:11.059 --> 30:12.852
I want to be with kids like me.

30:12.936 --> 30:14.479
You said they were out there.

30:18.441 --> 30:20.151
I'm gonna go to the Preserve.

30:21.277 --> 30:23.655
Because I'm sick of being the weird one.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.658
If there's anyone out there like me,

30:28.034 --> 30:29.035
I wanna meet 'em.

30:30.537 --> 30:32.330
I wanna see what they're like.

30:36.543 --> 30:37.377
You know,

30:38.211 --> 30:40.547
back when everything was falling apart…

30:42.882 --> 30:44.259
I had a little baby.

30:48.304 --> 30:49.389
A lot like you.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.143
When I saw him,

30:55.311 --> 30:57.355
I had no clue what to do with him.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.233
I didn't even know what he was.

31:00.316 --> 31:03.570
I mean, nobody knew
what to think in those days.

31:06.406 --> 31:09.367
I mean, how could I be responsible
for a little, I mean…

31:10.535 --> 31:12.245
So I wanted to run away too.

31:15.665 --> 31:16.583
What happened?

31:16.666 --> 31:18.084
Oh, I thought about it.

31:18.751 --> 31:21.671
[inhales]
And I realized I was just scared.

31:23.131 --> 31:24.757
I wasn't afraid of him.

31:27.093 --> 31:28.428
I was afraid of me.

31:34.475 --> 31:36.352
I think that fear was…

31:39.022 --> 31:42.358
love that I didn't know what to do with.

31:46.654 --> 31:47.989
But he needed me.

31:51.701 --> 31:52.744
So I stopped running.

31:55.330 --> 31:56.414
I turned around.

31:58.875 --> 32:00.501
And I went back to get him.

32:01.711 --> 32:02.837
Him and his mom.

32:07.425 --> 32:09.802
[inhales] But they were already gone.

32:13.431 --> 32:14.766
Someone had took 'em.

32:17.435 --> 32:19.312
And I never saw them again.
