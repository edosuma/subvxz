WEBVTT

00:01.583 --> 00:03.422
You're turning 43.

00:05.117 --> 00:08.370
If you don't mind,
I'm trying to appear vulnerable

00:08.370 --> 00:12.784
to facilitate my snorkeling
up your thigh bone later.

00:12.784 --> 00:15.677
Alan, you boyfriend,

00:15.677 --> 00:17.290
me girlfriend.

00:17.290 --> 00:18.904
You have a season's pass.

00:18.904 --> 00:21.152
You're ruining the conquest part,

00:21.152 --> 00:23.707
which is all it's really about for me.

00:23.707 --> 00:25.283
Really?

00:25.678 --> 00:27.711
Well, how about a little
play acting, then?

00:27.711 --> 00:31.290
Only if this time,
I get to be the sheep.

00:32.392 --> 00:33.822
I'm gonna sit over there

00:33.822 --> 00:35.430
and pretend to be alone.

00:35.671 --> 00:37.689
And you're gonna approach me,
being the stranger that you are,

00:37.689 --> 00:38.996
and conquest me.

00:38.996 --> 00:39.936
Don't be silly.

00:39.936 --> 00:44.142
No, I'd like to see
how you operate, Mr Shore.

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:02.144 --> 01:03.400
How are you doing?

01:03.884 --> 01:05.241
Fine, thank you.

01:05.774 --> 01:07.310
I'm Joe.

01:07.655 --> 01:09.112
I'm with somebody.

01:09.953 --> 01:11.042
Who?

01:11.042 --> 01:13.348
Hello, I'm a complete stranger.

01:13.348 --> 01:15.324
And I'm here to pick you up.

01:17.562 --> 01:20.010
Oh, I see. There's two of us.

01:20.010 --> 01:21.792
I'll be evens, you be odds.

01:21.792 --> 01:23.302
You got a problem?

01:23.845 --> 01:25.054
No, actually.

01:25.054 --> 01:28.874
I just saw this fair maiden here
talking to a tree trunk,

01:28.874 --> 01:32.417
and since I'm an arborist,
I thought I could help translate.

01:32.417 --> 01:34.219
Here's a health tip.

01:35.095 --> 01:36.695
–Walk away.
–Why would I do that?

01:36.695 --> 01:37.890
All right, guys.

01:37.890 --> 01:41.105
Don't be deceived by my cushy appearance.

01:41.105 --> 01:42.436
Excuse me.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.567
–I actually am with him.
–I don't care.

01:44.567 --> 01:47.309
Walk away, or I lay you out.

01:47.309 --> 01:51.692
I don't mean to be a stickler,
but isn't the object to lay her out?

01:51.692 --> 01:52.553
Hey!

01:52.553 --> 01:56.497
Oh, gee, I'm sorry,
I was reaching for my wallet.

01:57.096 --> 01:58.504
I see.

01:58.504 --> 02:00.942
Allow me to reach for mine.

02:04.280 --> 02:05.197
Are you all right?

02:05.197 --> 02:06.267
Fine.

02:06.678 --> 02:08.324
Hello, big people.

02:08.324 --> 02:11.730
Sorry to intrude,
but you seem rather strapping.

02:11.730 --> 02:12.941
Here's $300.

02:12.941 --> 02:16.739
Would you be so kind as
to go hit that man down there?

02:18.702 --> 02:20.283
Really? –Alan.

02:20.283 --> 02:23.169
There's an extra $100 if he goes down.

02:24.506 --> 02:25.750
You're on.

02:26.060 --> 02:28.894
–Make it a good one.
–Oh, for god's sakes.

02:41.925 --> 02:44.488
Here's $100, go help your friend.

02:50.787 --> 02:52.554
Gee, it seems Joe has buddies.

02:52.554 --> 02:53.407
One for you,

02:53.689 --> 02:55.367
one for you,

02:55.367 --> 02:56.932
I got plenty of them.

02:58.551 --> 02:59.760
Hit them hard now.

02:59.760 --> 03:01.646
For you and for you.

03:17.721 --> 03:20.878
Boston Legal
1x14. Till We Meet Again

03:45.089 --> 03:47.249
ORIGINAL AIR DATE ON ABC: 2005/02/13

03:47.628 --> 03:50.347
You don't think the evening was
slightly symptomatic of something?

03:50.347 --> 03:53.151
You take me to a college frat bar,
and you start a fight.

03:53.151 --> 03:54.073
I did not start it.

03:54.073 --> 03:57.075
–You certainly did start it.
–Alan, wonderful news.

03:57.075 --> 03:59.026
The Kerwin deposition
has been cancelled.

03:59.026 --> 04:00.095
You don't have to go.

04:00.095 --> 04:01.458
Your morning is now free,

04:01.458 --> 04:03.177
which works out
because it seems these

04:03.177 --> 04:05.723
two police officers are
here to arrest you.

04:05.723 --> 04:07.287
Are you Alan Shore?

04:07.566 --> 04:09.670
My, aren't you clever?

04:09.670 --> 04:12.250
I bet you make detective one day.

04:12.250 --> 04:15.107
Was my calling him Alan a clue?

04:15.485 --> 04:17.815
Please place your hands
behind your back.

04:17.815 --> 04:18.676
Why?

04:18.676 --> 04:20.487
Sir, please.
You're under arrest

04:20.487 --> 04:22.853
for conspiracy
to commit assault and battery.

04:22.853 --> 04:24.224
You have the right
to remain silent.

04:24.224 --> 04:25.828
You have it all memorized.

04:25.828 --> 04:28.450
Aren't you, the spiffy jiffy?

04:28.450 --> 04:30.496
And a sharp dresser.

04:31.368 --> 04:32.787
You have the right to an attorney.

04:32.787 --> 04:34.716
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you…

04:34.716 --> 04:35.843
Not to worry, dear.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.136
I'll cancel the rest of your day.

04:44.142 --> 04:46.477
<i>And in an unprecedented,
if not bizarre move,</i>

04:46.477 --> 04:50.052
<i>the selectmen of Summersport,
Massachusetts, a small south shore town,</i>

04:50.052 --> 04:55.356
<i>population 18,000, voted six to
two yesterday to ban red meat.</i>

04:55.356 --> 05:00.690
<i>As of midnight, it is now illegal to
serve or sell beef within the township.</i>

05:00.690 --> 05:04.846
<i>Mayor George Bostwick calling
the law a health and safety regulation.</i>

05:04.846 --> 05:06.905
God, health and safety.

05:06.905 --> 05:09.399
Did they not call a town
meeting to discuss this?

05:09.399 --> 05:12.226
Well, they did. And nobody really
took it that seriously.

05:12.226 --> 05:14.314
But the mayor controls the selectmen,

05:14.314 --> 05:17.713
and this is exactly the publicity
he's hoping to buy.

05:17.935 --> 05:20.249
In the meantime, my steak house
is out of business.

05:20.249 --> 05:22.123
How can you ban red meat?

05:22.123 --> 05:24.136
Well, they got a whole campaign
they're gonna go with it.

05:24.136 --> 05:27.264
They plan to promote Summersport
as the seafood capital of the world.

05:27.264 --> 05:29.076
We're carnivores.

05:29.076 --> 05:30.273
When the pilgrims landed,

05:30.273 --> 05:33.093
the first thing they did
was eat a few indians.

05:34.191 --> 05:35.307
Is there anything we can do?

05:35.307 --> 05:36.653
We'll get an immediate T.R.O.

05:36.653 --> 05:39.018
I'll argue it myself.
Ban red meat.

05:39.018 --> 05:42.480
That cannot pass constitutional mustard.

05:42.480 --> 05:45.271
The word is muster, Denny,
but you're right.

05:45.271 --> 05:46.933
The law lacks condiments.

05:46.933 --> 05:49.822
Let's mark up a motion and get going,
and let's do it in Suffolk.

05:49.822 --> 05:52.397
We should contact the owners of
the other affected restaurants,

05:52.397 --> 05:53.849
and have them join us.

05:56.492 --> 06:00.553
32744, commonwealth vs Alan Shore,

06:00.553 --> 06:02.800
conspiracy to commit battery.

06:02.800 --> 06:04.296
Tara Wilson for the defendant, your honor.

06:04.296 --> 06:06.812
We'll waive reading. I shouldn't think
there'll be any question of bail.

06:06.812 --> 06:07.920
What have we got here?

06:07.920 --> 06:10.337
He paid some guys in a bar
to assault another guy.

06:10.337 --> 06:12.252
Judge, the guy insulted my honor.

06:12.252 --> 06:15.258
I was required by the canons
of bar room conduct to respond.

06:15.258 --> 06:18.006
This being America, I simply
enlisted unsuspecting warriors

06:18.006 --> 06:20.413
who had no idea what I was
getting them into.

06:20.413 --> 06:21.861
Was anybody hurt?

06:21.861 --> 06:24.181
Cuts and bruises. There was
some damage to the bar.

06:24.181 --> 06:26.286
My suggestion is we admit to
sufficient facts

06:26.286 --> 06:28.083
so you'll continue it
without a finding.

06:28.083 --> 06:30.409
My client makes full
restitution to the bar.

06:30.409 --> 06:31.681
That's not gonna fly.

06:31.681 --> 06:34.042
It was self-defense.
Mr Shore was hit.

06:34.042 --> 06:36.796
The fact that he hired others to
do the hitting back doesn't preclude…

06:36.796 --> 06:40.001
You want a not guilty,
counsel, you need a trial.

06:40.001 --> 06:41.765
We could do it today.

06:41.999 --> 06:43.847
You're ready to proceed now?

06:43.847 --> 06:45.786
I'll stipulate to all the facts
in the police report,

06:45.786 --> 06:48.846
though I must take issue
with some of the spelling.

06:50.128 --> 06:52.591
If he stips to the facts,
I could be ready tomorrow.

06:52.591 --> 06:56.549
Jury trial, of course.
I can provide the court with
a list of my closest peers.

06:56.549 --> 06:58.417
I leave for Aspen on Wednesday.

06:58.417 --> 07:02.478
So we will complete this in one day.
10:00 tomorrow.

07:02.478 --> 07:05.519
The defendant is released
on personal recognizance.

07:05.519 --> 07:07.376
Mr Shore…

07:08.458 --> 07:13.537
it would be a big mistake to come
in here thinking this is funny.

07:17.015 --> 07:18.804
You mean it's not funny?

07:24.033 --> 07:26.134
You cannot just ban red meat.

07:26.134 --> 07:28.727
Any municipality can pass reasonable
health regulations.

07:28.727 --> 07:30.878
Ah, yes, let's just pause
on that word “reasonable.”

07:30.878 --> 07:32.948
Many towns are dry,
forbidding the sale of alcohol.

07:32.948 --> 07:35.134
There is an enormous
difference between the sale…

07:35.134 --> 07:37.417
Hold on one second, Ms Schmidt.

07:37.417 --> 07:39.875
In my courtroom, we allow
counsel to finish their thoughts.

07:39.875 --> 07:42.168
–We do not…
–if I could interrupt.

07:42.168 --> 07:45.152
The author of this particular
and preposterous legislation

07:45.152 --> 07:48.388
happens to be both politically ambitious
and a glutton for publicity,

07:48.388 --> 07:51.558
which this new law, funny thing,
happens to be generating.

07:51.558 --> 07:53.974
Red meat poses legitimate
health concerns.

07:53.974 --> 07:56.810
So do overzealous elected officials.
We don't just ban them.

07:56.810 --> 07:59.779
–If only we could.
–Now, I shall do the interrupting.

07:59.779 --> 08:02.951
If nothing else, I pride myself
on being a conscientious fact finder.

08:02.951 --> 08:04.931
Oh, brother.

08:05.829 --> 08:07.806
Mr Crane, did you say something?

08:07.806 --> 08:11.469
It's a stupid law.
Overturn it. Be a man.

08:13.488 --> 08:17.263
Mr Crane was trying to be helpful.
Apparently, he did not succeed.

08:17.263 --> 08:18.661
What is the reason, specifically,

08:18.661 --> 08:20.791
for your client banning
the sale of red meat?

08:20.791 --> 08:24.639
Bovine spongiform encephalopathy.

08:26.858 --> 08:28.138
Mad cow disease.

08:28.138 --> 08:30.369
–We're fearful of an outbreak.
–In Summersport?

08:30.369 --> 08:32.496
–Everywhere.
–That's ridiculous.

08:32.496 --> 08:34.784
Very well, we shall hold
an evidentiary hearing.

08:34.784 --> 08:36.746
First person I shall hear
from is the mayor.

08:36.746 --> 08:38.845
Then, Ms Schmidt, if you so desire,

08:38.845 --> 08:40.371
I shall listen to your client.

08:40.371 --> 08:42.121
Until then, we are adjourned.

08:42.121 --> 08:43.912
Put on a dress.

08:45.045 --> 08:46.600
2:00.

08:51.133 --> 08:52.905
What are you doing?

08:52.905 --> 08:55.260
I know this judge.
I know where his buttons are.

08:55.260 --> 08:56.792
Research shows, Denny,

08:56.792 --> 09:00.366
it's not wise to antagonize the people
whose favor you're trying to court.

09:00.366 --> 09:01.861
Oh, come on, Shirley.

09:01.861 --> 09:03.229
You still antagonize me,

09:03.229 --> 09:06.817
and we both know what's
really going on, don't we?

09:08.200 --> 09:11.595
You sweet man.

09:11.868 --> 09:15.860
It's been a long time
since you hit my button.

09:16.594 --> 09:19.931
I doubt you'd even know where to find it.

09:21.755 --> 09:23.390
Just a matter of time, Shirley.

09:23.390 --> 09:25.526
Just a matter of time.

09:28.011 --> 09:30.852
This doesn't involve you, man,
it's sexual.

09:31.253 --> 09:33.489
I thought you said the judge
would strike the law down.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.437
I just got a little tougher, Dominick.

09:35.437 --> 09:37.852
They played the mad cow card.

09:47.884 --> 09:51.320
Sometimes a mayor has to do what's
right even if it isn't popular.

09:51.320 --> 09:52.811
Red meat presents risks

09:52.811 --> 09:57.444
which I, as the guardian of my
constituency, am unwilling to assume.

09:57.686 --> 09:59.777
Legislation is capricious on its face.

09:59.777 --> 10:01.826
That'll be our only comment at this time.

10:01.826 --> 10:03.422
Pop goes the weasel.

10:03.422 --> 10:04.790
All right, Denny Crane.

10:04.790 --> 10:07.001
Still cuckoo for cuckoo puffs.

10:07.213 --> 10:08.247
Who's your daddy?

10:08.247 --> 10:09.297
Denny Crane.

10:09.297 --> 10:11.009
Pop goes the weasel.

10:12.708 --> 10:15.776
Simply put, I don't think we can
guarantee the safety of beef.

10:15.776 --> 10:16.722
Why not?

10:16.722 --> 10:19.246
For starters, we just lifted
the ban on Canadian cattle,

10:19.246 --> 10:23.847
where mad cow disease
was just found again.

10:24.071 --> 10:26.746
The percentage of mad cow in
Canada is statistically…

10:26.746 --> 10:28.472
But why take chances?

10:28.472 --> 10:30.007
Consider this disease.

10:30.007 --> 10:32.280
it's incurable, it rots the brain,

10:32.280 --> 10:35.372
it's invariably fatal,
and it's a painful death.

10:35.372 --> 10:39.669
But our government has assured us
there's absolutely no danger in this.

10:39.669 --> 10:42.111
Our government is pro-beef.
Are you kidding?

10:42.111 --> 10:48.486
In the last five years, the agriculture
business has donated $140 million

10:48.486 --> 10:51.256
to congressional and
presidential candidates.

10:51.256 --> 10:54.390
Fast-food chains, the cattlemen's
beef association, you name it,

10:54.390 --> 10:55.786
they've all given big bucks.

10:55.786 --> 10:57.947
But the department of agriculture says…

10:57.947 --> 11:01.025
Oh, please, the USDA's in
the meat industry's back pocket.

11:01.025 --> 11:02.730
What evidence do you have of that?

11:02.730 --> 11:03.862
You want evidence?

11:03.862 --> 11:06.227
How about the last secretary of agriculture

11:06.227 --> 11:10.645
appointed meat industry advocates
to top jobs at the USDA?

11:10.645 --> 11:14.322
How about the secretary's
former chief of staff used to be

11:14.322 --> 11:19.305
the chief lobbyist for the national
cattlemen's beef association?

11:19.305 --> 11:21.066
The USDA has been bought.

11:21.066 --> 11:23.074
Pretty strong words, Mr Bostwick.

11:23.074 --> 11:25.825
–Oprah got sued for saying less.
–Well, what does that tell you?

11:25.825 --> 11:27.862
The meat industry gets to sue
a talk show host

11:27.862 --> 11:29.136
for putting down a hamburger?

11:29.136 --> 11:31.308
Free speech doesn't apply
when it comes to beef?

11:31.308 --> 11:35.004
Well, certainly, the USDA has
an interest in making meat safe?

11:35.004 --> 11:36.907
But they have a double mandate,
your honor.

11:36.907 --> 11:39.356
And while one may be to keep beef safe,

11:39.356 --> 11:40.928
the other, the bigger one…

11:40.928 --> 11:43.402
is to promote the sale
of American meat.

11:43.402 --> 11:47.660
You think there's a real interest in
this country in rooting out mad cow disease?

11:47.660 --> 11:48.753
It's “don't ask, don't tell.”

11:48.753 --> 11:53.051
Objection! –This past April,
a cow stumbled and fell in Texas.

11:53.051 --> 11:56.141
The vets suspected a central
nervous system disorder.

11:56.141 --> 11:58.053
That animal should have been tested.

11:58.053 --> 12:00.760
It wasn't.It was quickly slaughtered
and put into pig feed.

12:00.760 --> 12:04.703
Why? Because god forbid
we discover mad cow disease.

12:04.703 --> 12:07.268
It would cost billions
and billions of dollars.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.040
I'm not gonna wait.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.652
If that gets me sued, so be it.

12:17.077 --> 12:19.048
How many people in this country
have been afflicted

12:19.048 --> 12:21.419
with the human strain of
mad cow disease?

12:21.419 --> 12:23.917
I don't plan to… –To wait, yes.
How many?

12:23.917 --> 12:26.576
–We don't know.
–There have been no confirmed cases.

12:26.576 --> 12:27.732
According to some scientists,

12:27.732 --> 12:31.781
many people we think have Alzheimer's
could, in fact, be sick from mad cow.

12:31.781 --> 12:33.691
Are you a scientist, sir? –No.

12:33.691 --> 12:36.242
Before you became mayor,
what was your occupation?

12:36.242 --> 12:37.532
I owned auto dealerships.

12:37.532 --> 12:39.528
You were a car salesman.

12:39.528 --> 12:43.824
Given that three million people are
killed or injured on our roads every year,

12:43.824 --> 12:45.857
do you also plan to ban automobiles?

12:45.857 --> 12:48.022
No. –What about salmonella?

12:48.022 --> 12:49.461
Any plans to criminalize chickens?

12:49.461 --> 12:52.995
–People don't die from chickens or…
–What about mercury in fish?

12:52.995 --> 12:54.571
It's a concern.

12:54.571 --> 12:56.890
But, again, I made a judgment as mayor,

12:56.890 --> 12:59.660
and the selectmen concurred
that the dangers of beef…

12:59.660 --> 13:02.323
Have you any personal political ambitions

13:02.323 --> 13:04.974
beyond that of being mayor of Summersport?

13:04.974 --> 13:07.028
I'm not trying to get headlines,
if that's what you're saying.

13:07.028 --> 13:10.004
I didn't say that,
but funny you did.

13:11.029 --> 13:12.810
Have you got anything?

13:14.583 --> 13:17.442
You would agree, Mr Mayor,
that by and large,

13:17.442 --> 13:19.382
vegetarians are communists.

13:19.382 --> 13:20.749
I certainly would not.

13:20.749 --> 13:22.401
We're at war, Mr Bostwick.

13:22.401 --> 13:24.716
Think we can win that war
if we suddenly say to our soldiers,

13:24.716 --> 13:25.792
“no more meat”?

13:25.792 --> 13:28.654
Think a nation of fish-eaters
can protect the world, you wimp?

13:28.654 --> 13:32.098
–Objection.
–Withdrawn. Nothing further.

13:32.098 --> 13:35.565
What the hell are you doing?

13:35.565 --> 13:37.817
Don't bother with the merits, Shirley.

13:37.817 --> 13:40.492
This case, it's all about the judge.

14:13.562 --> 14:15.471
You asked to see us.

14:15.471 --> 14:16.533
Sit.

14:17.717 --> 14:19.306
Not to worry.
This is standard.

14:19.306 --> 14:20.588
He purposely doesn't look up.

14:20.588 --> 14:25.044
It's a technique taught in the '40s
for establishing dominion.

14:31.134 --> 14:35.441
You were involved in a bar
altercation last night?

14:35.441 --> 14:36.804
Altercation? I think not.

14:36.804 --> 14:38.432
It was a brawl.

14:38.432 --> 14:41.441
–And you were arrested?
–I was.

14:41.441 --> 14:43.356
Trial starts tomorrow, actually.

14:43.356 --> 14:46.916
Can I count on you
as a character witness?

14:46.916 --> 14:48.581
Who's defending you?

14:48.581 --> 14:53.684
I'm representing myself,
with Tara's assistance.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.973
There's no opportunity to plead this out?

14:55.973 --> 14:58.897
Only if I plead guilty,
which is, of course, unacceptable.

14:58.897 --> 15:00.961
I have to worry about a three strikes law,

15:00.961 --> 15:04.975
since I plan to commit future crimes.

15:06.003 --> 15:11.005
I don't know what kind of career
death wish you have, Mr Shore,

15:11.005 --> 15:13.565
but if you're convicted,
if you get time,

15:13.565 --> 15:15.470
your employment will be terminated.

15:15.470 --> 15:17.232
That may be of little
consequence to you…

15:17.232 --> 15:20.190
If I had a nickel for every time
you've threatened to fire me, Paul,

15:20.190 --> 15:22.488
I could simply retire.

15:22.488 --> 15:24.738
Alan, cut it out.

15:25.544 --> 15:29.945
It is not my habit to lecture,

15:30.275 --> 15:34.090
but what you did last night
was selfish.

15:34.090 --> 15:38.514
We have a reputation here
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

15:38.514 --> 15:42.410
The attorneys here take
great pride in that reputation.

15:42.410 --> 15:45.968
It undermines everyone
at Crane, Poole & Schmidt

15:45.968 --> 15:49.568
when a lawyer here
is criminally prosecuted.

15:49.568 --> 15:53.112
Your actions hurt people.

15:53.326 --> 15:57.785
All of us must now tender explanations

15:57.785 --> 16:00.816
to our friends, our colleagues,

16:00.816 --> 16:06.525
to safeguard and repair the reputation
of Crane, Poole & Schmidt.

16:06.525 --> 16:07.888
Stop it!

16:13.047 --> 16:14.692
I've had it.

16:17.301 --> 16:18.476
Do you hear me?

16:18.476 --> 16:20.227
I have had it.

16:23.416 --> 16:25.424
Get out, both of you.

16:51.864 --> 16:54.174
Personally, I would never eat meat.

16:54.174 --> 16:55.316
Why, doctor?

16:55.316 --> 16:58.582
We don't have the means to keep track
of what cattle are being fed,

16:58.582 --> 17:00.808
nor are we adequately testing them,
in my opinion.

17:00.808 --> 17:03.635
Your honor, I object to paranoia
being offered as evidence.

17:03.635 --> 17:05.964
I'm sorry, but it's absolutely reckless

17:05.964 --> 17:08.412
for a government to
be telling us we're safe

17:08.412 --> 17:11.852
when the scientific community
can't necessarily detect all the ways

17:11.852 --> 17:14.555
this disease can be contracted
or transmitted.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.474
But let's look at statistics.

17:16.474 --> 17:20.301
Nobody in this country seems to be
getting sick from mad cows.

17:20.301 --> 17:22.551
Judge, we just can't know that.

17:22.551 --> 17:26.098
The disease may have an incubation
period of up to 40 years.

17:26.098 --> 17:27.761
You may be infected right now.

17:27.761 --> 17:28.991
My point is,

17:28.991 --> 17:32.739
nobody now seems to be
demonstrating symptoms.

17:32.739 --> 17:34.899
We don't know that for sure, either.

17:35.089 --> 17:37.392
The human strain of
the mad cow disease

17:37.392 --> 17:39.498
is called Creutzfeldt-Jakob.

17:39.498 --> 17:40.824
We call it CJD.

17:40.824 --> 17:45.191
But you can also get CJD sporadically,
with no link to infected meat.

17:45.191 --> 17:48.294
And some of the people
we've diagnosed with Alzheimer's

17:48.294 --> 17:50.530
might, in fact, have CJD.

17:50.530 --> 17:54.111
We don't know how many cases
there really are.

17:54.111 --> 17:57.248
You cannot tell me the government
has all this figured out.

17:57.248 --> 17:59.220
And the government just covers this up?

17:59.220 --> 18:01.482
Well, it's probably
not so much a cover-up.

18:01.482 --> 18:04.400
It's just we're not terribly
motivated to discover the problem.

18:04.400 --> 18:06.401
The economic consequences
would be too severe.

18:06.401 --> 18:07.886
Economic consequences,

18:07.886 --> 18:10.913
the beef industry would risk
an outbreak of mad cow disease.

18:10.913 --> 18:12.536
That wouldn't bankrupt them overnight?

18:12.536 --> 18:15.827
The beef industry can't always
tell when a cow is sick,

18:15.827 --> 18:19.341
and they're desperate to believe
that isolated cases are isolated cases.

18:19.341 --> 18:21.766
And the department of agriculture
just plays along?

18:21.766 --> 18:25.295
The month after that sick cow
was found in Washington state,

18:25.295 --> 18:29.160
mad cow testing dropped almost 50%.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.121
–That's outrageous.
–It eventually went up.

18:31.121 --> 18:34.955
Look, they tried to track the herd
where that Washington cow came from…

18:34.955 --> 18:37.939
they couldn't find 53 of the 80 cows.

18:37.939 --> 18:41.243
They've since admitted their cattle
trackback system isn't up and running,

18:41.243 --> 18:44.703
and it would have to be done
on a voluntary basis.

18:44.703 --> 18:46.295
Voluntary…

18:46.295 --> 18:52.639
please, what meat-packing plant wants
the distinction of having a mad cow?

18:53.170 --> 18:55.819
Which is why I order the fish.

18:59.687 --> 19:01.725
Denny. –Hmm.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.811
–I'm getting my ass kicked here.
–I can see that.

19:03.811 --> 19:06.107
Any suggestions?

19:09.527 --> 19:11.396
–How old are you, sir?
–46.

19:11.396 --> 19:14.462
I'm 72, and I can mop the floor
with you. You know why?

19:14.462 --> 19:16.463
I eat meat.

19:16.463 --> 19:18.471
Makes me strong, builds
up my immune system,

19:18.471 --> 19:21.047
fights off a whole bunch of other
diseases I might have had

19:21.047 --> 19:23.479
if I weren't so strong.

19:23.718 --> 19:26.427
Red meat saves lives, baby.

19:26.427 --> 19:28.158
–You ever think about that?
–I'm sorry,

19:28.158 --> 19:31.338
but there's no real
evidence to support that opinion.

19:31.802 --> 19:34.020
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:34.531 --> 19:37.424
Any hard evidence to support yours?

19:37.970 --> 19:39.929
Hard evidence, no.

19:42.799 --> 19:47.479
But I don't think we really want to wait
for that evidence to come rushing in.

19:52.701 --> 19:54.503
I had him there,

19:54.768 --> 19:56.664
right till the end.

19:59.390 --> 20:02.164
He basically offered us $100 to fight.

20:02.164 --> 20:03.334
You took the money.

20:03.334 --> 20:05.045
Yes. –And you fought.

20:05.045 --> 20:06.366
Yes.

20:06.590 --> 20:08.063
Thank you, sir.

20:10.998 --> 20:12.909
Interesting. We agree to
stipulate to the facts,

20:12.909 --> 20:15.310
and the prosecution sees fit
to distort them just the same.

20:15.310 --> 20:16.938
–Objection.
–Mr Edwards, I didn't say,

20:16.938 --> 20:18.899
“here's $100, go fight,” did I?

20:18.899 --> 20:21.281
Well… –Did I not first ask
your friend Mike

20:21.281 --> 20:23.514
to avenge an assault
committed against me?

20:23.514 --> 20:25.618
Yes. –And then when Mike
was attacked,

20:25.618 --> 20:28.753
I enlisted you and others
to go to his aid, did I not?

20:28.753 --> 20:31.538
Yes. –And the man who first
assaulted me

20:31.538 --> 20:34.040
had many colleagues who
joined the fray, did he not? –Yes.

20:34.040 --> 20:37.470
In fact, Joe's friends first turned it
into a brawl, wouldn't you say?

20:37.470 --> 20:41.509
Yes. –And as a friend of Mike's,
is it your testimony

20:41.509 --> 20:45.143
you would not have gone to his aid
had I not offered you money?

20:45.143 --> 20:47.638
No, I would have probably
jumped in anyway at that point.

20:47.638 --> 20:49.957
Well, given your honest
and forthright testimony,

20:49.957 --> 20:52.506
which has shed blinding light
on what happened in the bar that night,

20:52.506 --> 20:54.073
would you now consider yourself

20:54.073 --> 20:57.951
a witness more for the prosecution
or the defense?

20:59.007 --> 21:01.938
Um, I guess defense.

21:01.938 --> 21:03.638
Thank you, Mr Edwards.

21:03.638 --> 21:06.222
You deserve another $100.

21:16.394 --> 21:17.547
We're going to lose?

21:17.547 --> 21:18.884
It hasn't gone well.

21:18.884 --> 21:19.991
Surely you've noticed.

21:19.991 --> 21:21.945
My grandfather started this steak house.

21:21.945 --> 21:23.242
How can…

21:23.573 --> 21:25.868
–I just can't believe it.
–Look, it isn't over yet.

21:25.868 --> 21:28.305
We still have summations, but…

21:31.586 --> 21:33.467
Let me tell you this one more time.

21:33.467 --> 21:35.654
Play the judge.

21:35.654 --> 21:38.105
The man lives with his mother,
and he wears lifts.

21:38.105 --> 21:40.512
The buzzword is nansy-pansy.

21:40.512 --> 21:43.651
–I beg your pardon.
–Nansy-pansy.

21:43.651 --> 21:45.743
He doesn't want to fall
on that side of the fence.

21:45.743 --> 21:48.493
It's even worse than namby-pamby.

21:48.493 --> 21:51.733
–What are you talking about?
–Trust me, Shirley.

21:52.868 --> 21:55.373
For once, can you do that?

21:57.081 --> 22:00.345
Nansy-pansy.

22:09.106 --> 22:11.601
I was thinking perhaps I should close.

22:11.601 --> 22:13.059
Don't be ridiculous.

22:13.059 --> 22:14.805
–I'm sorry?
–No offense, Tara,

22:14.805 --> 22:17.080
but since I handled the witness,
the jury will be…

22:17.080 --> 22:19.725
Did you see the faces on the jury?

22:19.975 --> 22:21.015
They weren't impressed.

22:21.015 --> 22:22.640
They found you smug.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.532
You were, perhaps, too
self-satisfied to notice.

22:26.687 --> 22:30.364
Are we at a certain point
in our cycle, Tara?

22:34.388 --> 22:36.141
I apologize.

22:36.141 --> 22:37.592
Do you?

22:38.722 --> 22:40.505
That's a first.

22:43.884 --> 22:46.125
Say what you must.

22:46.863 --> 22:49.291
I was hugely embarrassed
by what happened at the bar,

22:49.291 --> 22:51.000
not to mention terrified.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.941
I could have been injured.
Did that ever occur to you?

22:53.941 --> 22:54.972
I mean, it would have been one thing

22:54.972 --> 22:57.568
had you had a neanderthal
reaction and swung back,

22:57.568 --> 22:59.846
but your response was considered.

22:59.846 --> 23:03.895
You reflectively, calmly
orchestrated your violence.

23:03.895 --> 23:06.137
People could have been hurt.

23:06.137 --> 23:08.150
I could have been hurt,

23:08.150 --> 23:09.788
but you've not once considered that,

23:09.788 --> 23:12.942
because contrary to the rumor that
you are the center of the universe,

23:12.942 --> 23:16.086
clearly you are the universe,

23:16.309 --> 23:19.904
and I, for one,
am getting sick of it.

23:42.719 --> 23:44.579
Alan Shore's a good lawyer, Paul.

23:44.579 --> 23:47.210
If we fire him,
it does leave a hole.

23:47.210 --> 23:48.737
I am certainly mindful of that,

23:48.737 --> 23:50.851
but how far do we let him push us?

23:50.851 --> 23:53.497
He has done this at every firm
he has worked for.

23:53.497 --> 23:55.555
He defies them to the point…

23:55.555 --> 23:57.240
His last firm sued him.

23:57.240 --> 24:00.379
Yes, and he went on.
They didn't.

24:00.542 --> 24:02.341
Schmidt, you called?

24:02.341 --> 24:04.360
Cellina, I called you
three hours ago.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.506
Where have you been?

24:05.506 --> 24:06.674
Patriots parade.

24:06.674 --> 24:08.690
The patriots parade was last week.

24:08.690 --> 24:10.687
Three super bowls, four years.

24:10.687 --> 24:12.545
I'm still on parade.

24:13.558 --> 24:17.118
You worked on that Ianetti meat-packing
case last year, didn't you?

24:17.118 --> 24:17.938
Yes.

24:17.938 --> 24:21.602
What do you know about
that cow in Washington state?

24:22.616 --> 24:25.662
I'm about to suffer
an embarrassing defeat in court.

24:25.662 --> 24:29.180
I need to show that what happened in
Washington was an isolated, what?

24:29.180 --> 24:31.325
Don't go near the Washington case.

24:31.325 --> 24:34.033
It's possible it wasn't
even a downer cow.

24:34.033 --> 24:35.979
What do you mean, downer cow?

24:35.979 --> 24:38.431
Basically, it means the cow fell down.

24:38.431 --> 24:40.852
We're told that the mad cows
are easy to spot

24:40.852 --> 24:43.248
because they stumble and fall.

24:43.248 --> 24:45.348
We were told that this cow fell,

24:45.348 --> 24:47.124
but eyewitnesses in Washington

24:47.124 --> 24:51.312
say the cow was walking
and was tested only as a fluke.

24:51.312 --> 24:52.307
Which means…

24:52.307 --> 24:57.821
while we're being told that the sick cows
show easily detectable symptoms…

24:57.821 --> 25:02.013
they sometimes don't,
and therefore go undetected.

25:02.013 --> 25:05.200
Stay away from the Washington case.

25:05.512 --> 25:07.111
Thank you, Cellina.

25:12.096 --> 25:14.416
Pardon the expression, but…

25:14.416 --> 25:15.814
I'm dead meat.

25:15.814 --> 25:17.791
You really think
you're going to lose?

25:17.791 --> 25:21.394
I'm tempted to employ Denny's strategy.

25:21.394 --> 25:23.795
Which is…

25:24.133 --> 25:27.784
Nansy-pansy.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.775
All I know is he instigated the brawl.

25:31.775 --> 25:34.720
The charge is conspiracy
to commit aggravated assault.

25:34.720 --> 25:36.842
Talking about me, Brad?

25:37.564 --> 25:41.011
Yeah, we're just trying
to imagine you as an instigator.

25:41.011 --> 25:42.992
What's that supposed to mean?

25:45.582 --> 25:46.919
Sorry.

25:47.262 --> 25:49.142
–Forget it.
–No, let's not forget it.

25:49.142 --> 25:50.749
How about you say
what you have to say?

25:50.749 --> 25:53.826
Or is that too monumental an effort,
completing whole sentences?

25:53.826 --> 25:55.671
–Come on, Alan.
–You want to talk about me, Lori?

25:55.671 --> 25:57.861
Perhaps you should reposition
yourself behind my back.

25:57.861 --> 25:59.095
Isn't that the rule of the game?

25:59.095 --> 26:01.050
I don't talk about you
behind your back.

26:01.050 --> 26:02.969
You're not that interesting.

26:03.738 --> 26:05.909
I'm tired of this.
Got that?

26:10.377 --> 26:12.162
I don't know what's going on
with you, sport,

26:12.162 --> 26:14.552
but you're certainly smart
enough to realize

26:14.552 --> 26:18.231
that I could probably dismember
you in about the time…

26:18.729 --> 26:19.814
Then do it. –Cut it out.

26:19.814 --> 26:21.198
What the hell is going on?

26:21.198 --> 26:23.282
Careful, Tara. I wouldn't
want you to get hurt.

26:23.282 --> 26:24.242
Listen to me.

26:24.242 --> 26:27.330
Talking to others as if I weren't
the only one in the universe.

26:27.330 --> 26:28.804
When will I learn?

26:28.804 --> 26:30.805
No, when will we learn?

26:31.107 --> 26:34.174
That you are always right.

26:36.622 --> 26:39.088
That it makes sense
to start a bar room brawl.

26:39.088 --> 26:43.814
That it's perfectly reasonable to get
into a shoving match at the office.

26:44.045 --> 26:47.496
Nothing could be going on with you.

26:49.047 --> 26:52.099
When will we learn?

26:55.032 --> 26:56.942
Get help.

27:07.997 --> 27:12.036
We had an expression in this country
years ago called “where's the beef?”

27:12.036 --> 27:15.414
Translation, where's the substance?

27:15.705 --> 27:17.832
Your honor, do you know anybody

27:17.832 --> 27:21.354
who's been victimized
by mad cow disease?

27:21.354 --> 27:23.915
Know anybody who knows anybody?

27:24.379 --> 27:29.679
Know anybody who knows anybody
who knows anybody?

27:30.087 --> 27:32.880
There's simply not a shred of
evidence to

27:32.880 --> 27:35.706
suggest that a single person
in this country

27:35.706 --> 27:39.315
has ever become ill from a mad cow.

27:39.519 --> 27:41.921
But why wait?

27:41.921 --> 27:43.370
That's the mayor's jingle.

27:43.370 --> 27:45.792
Why wait?

27:46.051 --> 27:48.500
Because this man and others like him

27:48.500 --> 27:53.491
have sacrificed their lives and their
livelihoods building their restaurants.

27:53.491 --> 27:55.484
Maybe as a courtesy,

27:55.484 --> 27:58.443
we could wait for a scintilla of evidence

27:58.443 --> 28:02.130
before arbitrarily destroying
their businesses.

28:02.130 --> 28:03.451
The fact is,

28:03.451 --> 28:07.148
the USDA has done an exemplary job
conducting tests,

28:07.148 --> 28:10.803
establishing safeguards to prevent
the outbreak of mad cow disease,

28:10.803 --> 28:13.343
which is probably
why it hasn't broken out.

28:13.343 --> 28:16.752
Well, we could give in to
our fear and panic…

28:16.752 --> 28:18.779
baseless panic.

28:18.779 --> 28:21.430
but that would make us…

28:25.634 --> 28:29.136
a nation of nansy-pansies.

28:29.136 --> 28:31.187
I don't know about you, but…

28:31.187 --> 28:35.358
I don't want to be a nansy-pansy.

28:40.129 --> 28:42.178
Towns make rules all the time.

28:42.178 --> 28:45.875
Lots of them zoned fast-food
restaurants out of business.

28:45.875 --> 28:47.442
Through permits,

28:47.656 --> 28:50.847
they can control
how you build your house.

28:50.847 --> 28:54.298
Some towns ban alcohol, cigarettes.

28:54.298 --> 28:55.609
Others have curfews.

28:55.609 --> 28:57.932
We do all kinds of things.

28:57.932 --> 29:02.198
The only legal requirement
is that the laws are reasonable.

29:02.198 --> 29:07.972
It is not unreasonable to fear
an outbreak of mad cow disease.

29:07.972 --> 29:09.817
We've had a case in Washington state,

29:09.817 --> 29:12.924
another last month in Canada.

29:12.924 --> 29:15.865
We just lifted the ban on Canadian beef.

29:15.865 --> 29:19.561
The incubation period for
this disease could be decades.

29:19.561 --> 29:23.323
We have no guarantee that
we're not already infected.

29:23.323 --> 29:25.489
It is simply reckless

29:25.489 --> 29:28.023
for the government to be injecting certainty

29:28.023 --> 29:30.372
when the scientific community cannot.

29:30.372 --> 29:31.705
And forget mad cow.

29:31.705 --> 29:36.430
We already know that eating beef
can cause high cholesterol, heart disease.

29:36.430 --> 29:38.472
It increases the risk of colon cancer.

29:38.472 --> 29:43.142
There's listeria and E. coli,
which has already killed people.

29:43.142 --> 29:44.524
Dioxin,

29:44.524 --> 29:47.484
the poison that almost killed
the Ukrainian president,

29:47.484 --> 29:51.257
that stuff is on our grazing grass.

29:51.257 --> 29:53.469
Scientists say the average American has

29:53.469 --> 29:56.285
about 10 units of dioxin in their blood fat

29:56.285 --> 29:59.529
simply from eating animal fat.

30:00.126 --> 30:04.825
There are all kinds of
reasonable justifications

30:04.825 --> 30:09.453
for a mayor to try to reduce red meat
from the diet of his citizenry.

30:09.453 --> 30:11.449
And let me remind you.

30:11.669 --> 30:13.144
there is nothing…

30:13.769 --> 30:17.010
nothing in the constitution

30:17.010 --> 30:21.765
that guarantees anybody
the right to sell a hamburger.

30:36.415 --> 30:38.202
This wasn't self-defense.

30:38.202 --> 30:40.532
Mr Shore was not under
any physical threat

30:40.532 --> 30:42.565
when he paid the first man to fight.

30:42.565 --> 30:45.636
This was vengeance for hire.

30:45.636 --> 30:49.323
And once that violence began,
he started paying others to escalate it.

30:49.323 --> 30:51.618
These facts are not in dispute.

30:51.618 --> 30:54.873
The only real question for you here is,

30:54.873 --> 30:59.034
is Mr Shoreabove the law or not?

31:12.249 --> 31:14.436
I've been accused of,

31:14.436 --> 31:18.623
reflectively, perhaps even glibly,

31:18.623 --> 31:22.642
orchestrating a little revenge.

31:22.642 --> 31:26.324
Well, I guess that's how
I wanted it to look.

31:26.324 --> 31:29.307
A man punched me in the face

31:29.579 --> 31:32.113
in front of my girlfriend.

31:32.364 --> 31:36.648
And while my instinct
was to hit him back,

31:36.648 --> 31:40.279
the truth is, I was afraid.

31:40.668 --> 31:47.534
I was fearful that if I retaliated,
he would…

31:48.195 --> 31:50.186
beat me up.

31:50.186 --> 31:53.115
So I got somebody else
to do my fighting.

31:53.115 --> 31:56.467
Then things got out of hand.

31:58.203 --> 32:00.966
And, well…

32:01.290 --> 32:04.959
I had to send more and more troops

32:04.959 --> 32:08.638
to a war that should've ended quickly.

32:08.638 --> 32:11.203
But make no mistake,

32:11.203 --> 32:20.919
my reaction that night was not
so much reflective as it was…

32:21.804 --> 32:23.868
primal.

32:24.724 --> 32:27.212
A man hit me.

32:28.502 --> 32:37.237
And while we like to think of
ourselves as being evolved…

32:40.031 --> 32:43.196
maybe I should've just hit him.

32:44.794 --> 32:49.715
There's a warrior that lies within
the belly of every man.

32:49.715 --> 32:55.227
A warrior who, in my case,
has always gone unsatisfied.

32:55.227 --> 33:00.020
I tried to satisfy him
but without pain.

33:00.020 --> 33:03.335
That's what the craven do, sometimes.

33:03.818 --> 33:06.303
They stand out of the fray,

33:06.303 --> 33:11.148
thump their egos along with their chests,

33:11.465 --> 33:14.482
and let others do the fighting.

33:46.669 --> 33:48.889
Well, thank you all for staying late.

33:52.395 --> 33:54.594
I did some research of my own.

33:54.594 --> 33:58.870
As you may know, I pride myself
on being a conscientious fact finder.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.387
Here we go.

34:03.578 --> 34:05.468
Mad cow disease is here.

34:05.468 --> 34:07.865
And for all the guarantees
supplied by the government,

34:07.865 --> 34:10.331
the scientific community
doesn't back them up.

34:10.331 --> 34:13.643
We all have a right to be concerned.

34:13.643 --> 34:16.158
The governmental agencies
in place to protect us

34:16.158 --> 34:20.792
seem to be controlled by the industries
we need protection from.

34:20.792 --> 34:24.114
This mad cow disease started out
in Europe and worked its way over here,

34:24.114 --> 34:28.601
and it is true the scientists
are at odds with our government,

34:28.601 --> 34:30.545
but as a trier of fact,

34:30.545 --> 34:34.491
a judge must rely on facts.

34:34.491 --> 34:38.179
And there is no evidence of an epidemic.

34:38.179 --> 34:41.094
If a judge were to allow himself
to be governed by fear alone,

34:41.094 --> 34:43.366
well, then it is true,
and I agree.

34:43.366 --> 34:45.775
It would make him a…

34:46.723 --> 34:49.369
A nansy-pansy.

34:49.656 --> 34:52.270
This judge is anything but.

34:52.270 --> 34:54.608
I find the law banning
the sale of red meat

34:54.608 --> 34:58.739
to be premature, if not capricious,
and it is hereby overturned.

34:58.739 --> 35:00.570
Way to go, judge.

35:02.022 --> 35:03.874
Case adjourned.

35:06.275 --> 35:07.552
Anybody up for a burger?

35:07.552 --> 35:09.614
Thank you, thank you.

35:10.427 --> 35:12.029
Thank god.

35:15.679 --> 35:18.931
Well, Denny, I admit,
I had my doubts.

35:19.120 --> 35:22.295
But you won this case.
Thank you.

35:22.295 --> 35:25.027
Does this mean we're
having sex tonight?

35:26.205 --> 35:30.797
Allow me the dream a little longer.

35:31.346 --> 35:33.331
I won the day.

35:33.569 --> 35:36.393
I deserve to be rewarded.

35:36.393 --> 35:38.339
I'll give you this.

35:41.347 --> 35:44.570
Denny, Denny,

35:44.835 --> 35:48.492
Denny Crane.

36:06.382 --> 36:09.456
I must be acquitted.
She's not smiling.

36:09.456 --> 36:12.875
Madam foreperson, you've reached
a unanimous verdict?

36:12.875 --> 36:15.254
–We have, your honor.
–What say you?

36:16.043 --> 36:18.054
Commonwealth vs Alan Shore,

36:18.054 --> 36:21.319
on the count of conspiracy
to commit aggravated assault,

36:21.319 --> 36:25.790
we find the defendant
Alan Shore not guilty.

36:25.790 --> 36:27.743
We appeal, judge.

36:29.770 --> 36:33.434
Members of the jury, this completes
your service. You can go.

36:33.434 --> 36:35.484
Mr Shore.

36:36.340 --> 36:38.788
This probably doesn't have to be goodbye

36:38.788 --> 36:42.342
so much as until we meet again.

36:42.342 --> 36:44.146
Yes, your honor.

36:47.327 --> 36:49.661
She's attracted to me.

36:50.183 --> 36:51.499
No doubt.

36:52.012 --> 36:53.520
Tara…

36:54.304 --> 36:56.215
I am sorry.

36:56.559 --> 36:59.803
I never meant to put you in any danger.

36:59.803 --> 37:02.172
I know.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.158
When you…

37:09.089 --> 37:12.791
launched into that diatribe
about me being the…

37:12.791 --> 37:14.657
The universe?

37:17.490 --> 37:20.463
You even said you were sick of it.

37:22.771 --> 37:25.419
Are you sick of me?

37:29.439 --> 37:32.813
Are you sick of me, Tara?

37:34.806 --> 37:36.565
No.

37:45.583 --> 37:48.080
As much as I…

37:49.524 --> 37:54.450
loathe sentiment together
with its expression,

37:55.321 --> 37:57.853
I cherish you.

37:59.944 --> 38:02.360
You should just know…

38:07.260 --> 38:10.648
you really, really smell good.

38:12.901 --> 38:15.189
You smell good, too.

38:47.691 --> 38:49.486
How'd you do?

38:49.486 --> 38:52.777
The jury was out 15 minutes.
Not guilty.

38:53.259 --> 38:55.398
They took pity on me.

38:55.736 --> 38:57.702
Congratulations.

39:00.476 --> 39:02.248
I heard you won.

39:04.992 --> 39:07.286
Everything okay?

39:09.248 --> 39:11.833
I don't have Alzheimer's.

39:12.703 --> 39:15.094
I have mad cow disease.

39:17.357 --> 39:20.223
Well, it's nice to finally know.

39:27.013 --> 39:31.181
Ever beat up anybody
with your bare hands?

39:31.534 --> 39:33.551
Many times.

39:35.201 --> 39:36.916
Why?

39:37.570 --> 39:39.664
