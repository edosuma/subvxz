that you've created in...
[slurps]

09:19.291 --> 09:20.250
Forty-five minutes,

09:20.333 --> 09:22.458
we've got to get you
back to the boat!

09:22.542 --> 09:23.458
[grunts] Do not give orders.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.291
-I wield the scepter of Krum-Hai!
-[barks]

09:27.542 --> 09:29.250
Okay, now, the dog has it.

09:29.333 --> 09:30.750
[all] We must do as he bids.

09:30.834 --> 09:32.875
For he has the scepter!

09:32.959 --> 09:35.375
The floppy-eared one
will be our leader!

09:35.458 --> 09:37.291
I know, right?

09:37.375 --> 09:40.250
[Murawski] He has the scepter!
He is the chosen one!

09:40.333 --> 09:41.166
[indistinct chatter]

09:42.458 --> 09:43.709
We don't have time for this!

09:43.792 --> 09:45.291
The island will be under
water any second now!

09:45.375 --> 09:47.041
Why should we believe you?

09:47.125 --> 09:49.125
I invoke the right of Krum...

09:49.208 --> 09:50.375
[all screaming]

09:54.875 --> 09:56.125
The high tide!

09:56.208 --> 09:57.375
[Melissa] It's working!

09:59.709 --> 10:02.417
Everyone, hold on!

10:02.500 --> 10:04.583
Oh, the island spirits
are wrathful!

10:04.667 --> 10:06.417
I invoke the right of Krum...
Yeah.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.250
We're not
doing that anymore.

10:08.333 --> 10:10.250
Get it off! Get it off!

10:10.333 --> 10:11.542
Flying fish! Flying fish!

10:15.166 --> 10:16.333
[screaming]

10:17.792 --> 10:19.625
[on speaker] Congratulations
go to the S.S. Indulgence.

10:20.834 --> 10:24.083
You're the winners of the Jefferson G.
County Surf Competition.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.125
A boat can't win
a surf competition.

10:26.208 --> 10:29.000
That's like a washing machine
winning a beauty pageant!

10:29.083 --> 10:31.417
[man] A washing machine
can't win a beauty pageant.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.500
It's like a cardboard box
being appointed to the Supreme Court.

10:36.250 --> 10:37.417
Actually, I am okay with it!

10:37.500 --> 10:40.375
Well, apparently a boat can
win a surf competition.

10:40.458 --> 10:42.125
It just doesn't come up very often.

10:42.208 --> 10:43.375
And, well,
here's your prize money,

10:43.458 --> 10:45.792
$58, 212.

10:45.875 --> 10:48.000
That's just enough money
to fix the yacht.

10:48.083 --> 10:49.458
With $2 left over!

10:49.542 --> 10:52.208
We can buy a candy bar
and a half!

10:52.291 --> 10:54.125
You know, guys, I think
we handled ourselves

10:54.208 --> 10:55.375
pretty well
out there today.

10:55.458 --> 10:56.875
Yes, we did.

10:56.959 --> 10:59.041
[Bradley crying] Carla!

11:00.083 --> 11:02.625
Carla!

11:02.709 --> 11:04.125
Bradley,
there's a guy selling

11:04.208 --> 11:05.667
ice cream right there
on the beach.

11:05.750 --> 11:08.375
[Bradley tearfully]
It's not the same!
