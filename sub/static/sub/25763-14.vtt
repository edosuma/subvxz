Give me your audio thing.
I need to hear what's happening.

39:26.333 --> 39:28.467
Oh, my God.
>> KIM: Hi.

39:28.467 --> 39:32.600
>> TRISTAN: What's going on?
>> KIM: Um...

39:32.600 --> 39:37.633
Have you ever played pickleball?
>> KHLOE: She's like, "Have you

39:37.633 --> 39:41.233
ever played pickleball?"
>> KIM: It's like a mix between

39:41.233 --> 39:43.133
tennis and Ping-Pong.

39:44.367 --> 39:46.367
>> KOURTNEY: Are you on a phone
call?

39:46.367 --> 39:48.367
>> KHLOE: What phone would I be
on?

39:48.367 --> 39:50.367
>> KIM: So, it's a smaller
court, like a tennis court, but,

39:50.367 --> 39:52.333
like, tiny.
>> TRISTAN: So, there's no

39:52.333 --> 39:54.333
pickles?
>> KIM (laughing): No.

39:54.333 --> 39:56.500
>> TRISTAN: Oh, okay, okay.
>> KIM: No pickles.

39:56.500 --> 40:00.467
I have no idea how to even start
a conversation with Tristan.

40:00.467 --> 40:03.233
Pickleball is the first thing
that popped into my head.

40:03.233 --> 40:05.600
It was super awkward, but he's
an athlete.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.633
I just thought maybe talking
about sports would be common

40:07.633 --> 40:11.367
ground.
I'm such a good athlete.

40:11.367 --> 40:13.367
Have you ever seen me ski?
>> TRISTAN: You can ski?

40:13.367 --> 40:15.633
>> KIM: What?
Have you ever seen my video,

40:15.633 --> 40:18.500
or was I blocked at that point?
>> TRISTAN: No, no, uh, no, I

40:18.500 --> 40:21.133
didn't see it.
>> KIM: Okay, look.

40:21.133 --> 40:23.367
>> KHLOE: She's showing him the
videos, um...

40:23.367 --> 40:25.367
>> KOURTNEY: From skiing?
>> KHLOE: From skiing to prove

40:25.367 --> 40:27.767
what a good athlete she is.
>> TRISTAN: Holy (bleep).

40:27.767 --> 40:29.633
>> KIM: So I'm a good athlete.
>> TRISTAN: You're legit.

40:29.633 --> 40:31.133
>> KIM: No, no, no.
>> TRISTAN: You do winter

40:31.133 --> 40:32.700
sports.
>> KIM: I'm legitimately a

40:32.700 --> 40:34.400
really, really, really good
athlete.

40:34.400 --> 40:36.266
>> TRISTAN: So you're coming for
Lindsey Vonn's spot?

40:36.266 --> 40:38.300
>> KIM: No.
>> TRISTAN: You know who that

40:38.300 --> 40:40.233
is?
>> KIM: Yes, of course.

40:40.233 --> 40:42.266
She dated Tiger Woods.
>> TRISTAN: Yeah, she did.

40:42.266 --> 40:44.367
>> KIM: And she's a professional
skier.

40:44.367 --> 40:47.400
I'm really, really good.
>> KHLOE: I like that they're

40:47.400 --> 40:49.667
having a moment, so I won't
intrude.

40:49.667 --> 40:51.633
>> KIM: I bet you I can beat you
in some kind of sport, though.

40:51.633 --> 40:53.633
What do you...?
>> TRISTAN: Only winter sports.

40:53.633 --> 40:55.633
>> KIM: It's on. Challenge.
>> TRISTAN: May the best of us

40:55.633 --> 40:57.667
win. Yeah.
>> KIM: Challenge.

40:57.667 --> 40:59.567
>> TRISTAN: Calabasas versus
Hidden Hills. Yeah.

40:59.567 --> 41:03.266
>> KIM: Yes. Yes, that's a good
one.

41:03.266 --> 41:06.300
I just challenged Tristan to a
game of pickleball.

41:06.300 --> 41:10.266
I realized that, why am I
fighting this fight if no one

41:10.266 --> 41:12.700
else is?
I'm not gonna spend my time

41:12.700 --> 41:16.033
angry at someone else for
something that they didn't do to

41:16.033 --> 41:20.000
me.
I'm gonna move on, if that's

41:20.000 --> 41:22.400
what Khloe chooses to do.
I'm gonna be supportive of her.

41:22.400 --> 41:24.400
>> TRISTAN: First of all, I
thought you were gonna play

41:24.400 --> 41:26.400
this.
>> KHLOE: I am, 'cause I can't

41:26.400 --> 41:28.400
do pickleball? Can you?
You don't even know what that

41:28.400 --> 41:30.400
is.
I just heard of it yesterday.

41:30.400 --> 41:32.266
>> TRISTAN: Actually, I did.
I did know, I know how it is

41:32.266 --> 41:34.300
now. Yeah.
The combination of Ping-Pong

41:34.300 --> 41:35.533
and, uh, tennis.
>> KHLOE: Oh, true.

41:35.533 --> 41:37.266
>> KOURTNEY: It has a lot of
rules.

41:37.266 --> 41:39.300
>> KHLOE: No, there's a lot of
rules.

41:39.300 --> 41:41.033
You have to stay out of the
kitchen and do some...

41:41.033 --> 41:42.734
>> TRISTAN: I just thought that
Kim had the least athletic gene

41:42.734 --> 41:44.700
out of all three of you guys.
>> KHLOE: This one does.

41:44.700 --> 41:46.600
>> KIM: Kourtney does for sure.
>> TRISTAN: She works out every

41:46.600 --> 41:48.567
day.
>> KOURTNEY: How good am I in

41:48.567 --> 41:50.467
the gym?
>> TRISTAN: You're good.

41:50.467 --> 41:52.333
You've gotten much better.
Your lather's becoming a sweat

41:52.333 --> 41:55.333
now.
>> KOURTNEY: Yeah.

41:55.333 --> 41:57.567
>> KIM: Do you think I should
ask this guy to unblock me?

41:57.567 --> 41:59.700
>> TRISTAN: Dismissed.
>> KIM: There's no going back.

41:59.700 --> 42:01.700
>> TRISTAN: There's no going
back now.

42:01.700 --> 42:03.500
You're here now.

42:07.700 --> 42:10.066
(birds singing)
>> KHLOE: Oh, and this is what

42:10.066 --> 42:12.700
we're getting True.
>> LARSA: Are you cool with him

42:12.700 --> 42:16.066
now?
>> KIM: Yeah. It's all good.

42:16.066 --> 42:19.700
My relationship with Tristan--
it's a work in progress, but it

42:19.700 --> 42:22.233
is just really important to move
forward.

42:22.233 --> 42:25.500
We're such a close family.
We're one big family.

42:25.500 --> 42:28.734
You just have to just move on
and get over it.

42:28.734 --> 42:32.066
>> TRISTAN: (bleep)
>> KHLOE: Don't hurt yourself.

42:32.066 --> 42:34.100
>> KOURTNEY: Oh, my God.
Did you hit the tree?

42:34.100 --> 42:35.233
>> TRISTAN: No, no, I almost...
I didn't know it was that

42:35.233 --> 42:37.333
bouncy.
>> KHLOE: Do you know how to do

42:37.333 --> 42:39.100
this?
>> TRISTAN: I'll go with no

42:39.100 --> 42:41.367
socks.
>> LARSA: Tristan, I'm glad

42:41.367 --> 42:43.333
you're living your best life!
>> KHLOE: Have you ever been on

42:43.333 --> 42:46.333
a trampoline?
>> TRISTAN: Uh... maybe.

42:46.333 --> 42:48.333
>> KOURTNEY: This is, like, a
real deal trampoline.

42:48.333 --> 42:50.600
>> KHLOE: We're gonna get that
for True.

42:50.600 --> 42:52.600
No, don't do that.
>> KOURTNEY: Were you gonna try

42:52.600 --> 42:54.734
to flip?
>> TRISTAN: Yeah.

42:54.734 --> 42:56.734
I don't know if I...
>> KHLOE: Can you flip in real

42:56.734 --> 42:58.734
life?
>> TRISTAN: I can do a

42:58.734 --> 43:00.600
cartwheel.
>> KHLOE: No, you can't.

43:00.600 --> 43:02.533
>> TRISTAN: Back in 2005...
>> KHLOE: Kourtney can.

43:02.533 --> 43:05.000
Show him your cartwheel skills.
Look at this.

43:05.000 --> 43:08.100
(laughing): Oh, yeah.
You know I can't do it.

43:08.100 --> 43:13.767
>> LARSA: This is the life.
(children squealing)

43:13.767 --> 43:17.000
>> NORTH: One, two...
>> KIM: Being here, swimming,

43:17.000 --> 43:20.433
hanging out with my kids, with
my family-- this is the dream.

43:20.433 --> 43:23.367
This is what I love to do.
I mean, even having Tristan

43:23.367 --> 43:26.367
here-- it's just...
We're all together.

43:26.367 --> 43:29.367
It's so much fun, and this is
what life's all about.

43:29.367 --> 43:32.100
>> KOURTNEY: We're gonna...
we're gonna race.

43:32.100 --> 43:34.367
>> KIM: One.
>> KOURTNEY: One.

43:34.367 --> 43:40.567
>> ALL: Two. Three.
(indistinct chatter)

43:40.567 --> 43:45.133
>> KOURTNEY: My top fell off!
>> KIM: On the next episode...

43:45.133 --> 43:47.400
>> KRIS: I just got a call from
Shelli.

43:47.400 --> 43:49.667
She wants to put together this
huge poker tournament.

43:49.667 --> 43:51.667
>> MAN: Ready to learn some
poker?

43:51.667 --> 43:53.667
>> KIM: Don't underestimate...
No, underestimate me.

43:53.667 --> 43:55.667
I prefer it.
I'm all in.

43:55.667 --> 43:58.467
(Kris whoops)
So, I think I'm gonna go to

43:58.467 --> 44:01.000
Paris and go to the Louis
Vuitton show.

44:01.000 --> 44:03.133
>> KHLOE: How do you feel now?
>> KIM: I'm going really

44:03.133 --> 44:06.133
cautiously, but you never know
what could happen.

44:06.133 --> 44:08.133
