WEBVTT

00:17.984 --> 00:20.686
Dads <i>is recorded in front of</i>
<i>a live studio audience.</i>

00:23.456 --> 00:25.624
It's 9:00am. Why are you guys
eating spaghetti?

00:25.626 --> 00:28.527
Uh, we're trying to get
inspiration for our mafia game.

00:30.130 --> 00:31.997
Well, how's it going?

00:31.999 --> 00:33.699
(Italian accent):
Not-a so good.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.136
You know, the problem
is you guys are

00:37.138 --> 00:38.804
a couple of rich kids
from the suburbs.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.639
You probably never committed
a crime in your life.

00:40.641 --> 00:41.974
WARNER:
Uh, that's not true.

00:41.976 --> 00:44.309
From to 2000 to 2005,

00:44.311 --> 00:48.180
I stole every piece of music
ever created.

00:48.182 --> 00:51.150
And I once slandered Ke$ha
on an Internet message board

00:51.152 --> 00:52.985
by implying she was
involved in sex acts using

00:52.987 --> 00:55.054
her "A, dollar sign,
dollar sign."

00:57.323 --> 00:59.892
As edgy and dangerous
as you guys are,

00:59.894 --> 01:01.527
I think we should hire
a consultant who knows

01:01.529 --> 01:02.828
what he's talking about.

01:02.830 --> 01:04.196
What do you mean?
Like-like somebody

01:04.198 --> 01:06.065
who's actually
in the mafia?

01:06.900 --> 01:09.001
That's a really
good idea.

01:09.003 --> 01:10.169
No, it's not.

01:10.171 --> 01:11.737
Yeah, it is.

01:11.739 --> 01:13.505
Don't you remember
all the fun we had

01:13.507 --> 01:16.175
with the Nazis we got
for    <i>Kill Hit?</i>

01:16.177 --> 01:18.010
Hey, you know,
maybe we should develop

01:18.012 --> 01:22.014
our driving game
with Lindsay Lohan.

01:22.016 --> 01:24.083
Sounds like
more of a drinking game.

01:30.023 --> 01:31.223
You know,
you guys, I think

01:31.225 --> 01:34.059
I might be able to help
you find a consultant.

01:34.061 --> 01:37.096
I happen to have had a friend
that was in the mafia.

01:37.098 --> 01:41.700
His name is Johnny Johnny
DeSalvo DeSalvo.

01:41.702 --> 01:44.236
Dad, how do you know
somebody in the mafia?

01:44.238 --> 01:47.072
We tried to set up
a series of Alzheimer clinics

01:47.074 --> 01:50.109
for elderly Italians
called Fuhgeddaboudit.

01:53.213 --> 01:55.714
Wha... what happened?

01:55.716 --> 01:58.016
To what?

02:01.221 --> 02:03.055
Fuhgeddaboudit.

02:03.057 --> 02:04.223
Okay, I will.

02:04.225 --> 02:05.824
Jeez, you brought it up.

02:08.761 --> 02:12.064
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

02:12.066 --> 02:14.099
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:14.101 --> 02:17.936
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

02:17.938 --> 02:19.638
¶ <i>Na, na, na</i> ¶

02:19.640 --> 02:24.243
¶ So many stars up in the sky

02:24.245 --> 02:28.914
¶ So many questions have I

02:28.916 --> 02:30.916
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:30.918 --> 02:34.987
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

02:36.623 --> 02:39.124
I-I just don't want
somebody from the mafia

02:39.126 --> 02:40.292
in the office, you know?

02:40.294 --> 02:43.962
What-what if he makes us
an offer we can't refuse?

02:43.964 --> 02:47.266
Or-or worse,
we can't understand?

02:47.268 --> 02:49.768
Oh, I-I watched an episode
of   <i>Soprano</i>last night,

02:49.770 --> 02:52.004
so don't worry,
I got the lingo down.

02:52.006 --> 02:55.607
Oh, the gagoots on
that doorman, huh?

02:55.609 --> 02:58.010
I wanted to give him a
cuestamarole upside his scaputo.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.945
Yeah.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.347
He said he's gonna
have pizza for dinner.

03:04.817 --> 03:06.785
Johnny, this is
my son, Warner.

03:06.787 --> 03:08.120
Oh, nice to meet you.

03:08.122 --> 03:10.522
Whoa. Spaghetti's
been in the pot too long.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.826
Uh, hey, thank you so much
for consulting on our game.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.495
I'm Eli, Warner's
business partner.

03:16.497 --> 03:18.630
What are you,
in kindergarten?

03:18.632 --> 03:21.200
Well, he's
all yours.

03:21.202 --> 03:23.468
All right...

03:23.470 --> 03:27.005
now who do I got to whack around
here to get a tiny coffee?

03:27.007 --> 03:29.975
I'll get that for you.
How do you like it?

03:29.977 --> 03:32.211
Up against the hanging meats
in the back of the deli,

03:32.213 --> 03:34.112
but my coffee I'll take black.

03:35.548 --> 03:38.550
(clears throat)
Wow.

03:38.552 --> 03:41.720
Thank you. Thank you so much
for-for coming down to help us.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.156
M-My dad might have told you
that we're working on a game,

03:44.158 --> 03:45.824
uh, about the, uh...

03:45.826 --> 03:48.160
(whispers):
about the mafia.

03:48.162 --> 03:50.195
Mafia?

03:50.197 --> 03:53.465
You think because I'm Italian-
American, I'm in the Mafia?

03:54.667 --> 03:57.703
Wha... Well,
a-aren't you?

03:57.705 --> 04:00.172
Yeah.

04:00.174 --> 04:03.742
But the point is:
don't make assumptions.

04:04.911 --> 04:06.912
So, San Francisco, huh?

04:06.914 --> 04:09.681
So, what are you, like,
a bunch of fruit loops?

04:09.683 --> 04:11.383
No.

04:11.385 --> 04:14.253
Hey, guys.
Not all of us.

04:19.025 --> 04:21.193
You know, I think we should
get to work on the game

04:21.195 --> 04:23.862
so that Mr. DeSalvo can
get back to the family...

04:23.864 --> 04:24.863
his family.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.733
The-the, uh, normal,
uh, wife and kid...

04:27.735 --> 04:30.369
The, uh, non...

04:30.371 --> 04:33.105
(whispers):
I'm so sorry.

04:33.107 --> 04:36.375
Take a deep breath there,
lady pants.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.710
Now, just
so you know,

04:38.712 --> 04:41.546
I only got one rule:
I do <i>not</i> answer any questions.

04:41.548 --> 04:42.948
Any questions?

04:48.054 --> 04:49.621
Okay, good.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.557
Now, first thing, do not
make all these mob guys

04:52.559 --> 04:54.960
into stereotypical jerks.

04:54.962 --> 04:57.996
(snapping fingers)
Hey, eggroll, start typing.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.601
Then the player finds
out that this magarole's

05:02.603 --> 05:04.069
been skimming
off the top.

05:04.071 --> 05:06.138
So Tony "I Did Your Sister"
Martelli

05:06.140 --> 05:08.206
makes him go for a ride.

05:10.076 --> 05:11.943
Uh, what do you mean?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.512
They... they kill him?

05:15.581 --> 05:18.717
What part of "go for a ride"
do you not understand?

05:22.922 --> 05:24.956
Yes, badafootz.

05:24.958 --> 05:28.960
What if you actually
want to go for a ride?

05:28.962 --> 05:32.831
What am I, a dog
with my head out the window?

05:33.966 --> 05:35.934
Wow, your information
is so well-defined,

05:35.936 --> 05:38.503
it almost makes you think
this stuff really happened.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.941
Are you wearing a wire?

05:42.943 --> 05:45.344
No, I don't wear wires
and I don't carry pennies,

05:45.346 --> 05:49.014
'cause Mexicans will
strip you for the copper.

05:51.951 --> 05:54.019
Mr. DeSalvo, thank you
so much for your help.

05:54.021 --> 05:56.021
I mean, the game
really feels authentic now.

05:56.023 --> 05:58.357
Oh, sure thing, chopsticks.

05:58.359 --> 06:00.158
Oh...

06:00.160 --> 06:03.962
one more very
important detail.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.964
The consigliere
in the game

06:05.966 --> 06:08.033
needs to be
a talking meatball.

06:09.502 --> 06:11.803
A talking meatball?

06:11.805 --> 06:14.206
Yeah. A meatball that knows
all the family secrets,

06:14.208 --> 06:17.476
like who whacked who
what where with what, when.

06:17.478 --> 06:19.010
Plus...

06:19.012 --> 06:21.346
it's funny as hell.

06:21.348 --> 06:23.014
That is
a rib tickler, yeah.

06:23.016 --> 06:24.983
It's... it's amazing,
yeah.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.686
So, now, the, uh,
certain matter of my payment.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.821
Oh, yeah.
Uh, here you go.

06:29.823 --> 06:33.058
I, uh, added an 18%
"Please Don't Kill Us" tip.

06:34.694 --> 06:35.827
Whoa.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.162
What is that, a check?

06:37.164 --> 06:38.997
Y-Yeah.
Uh...

06:38.999 --> 06:40.899
Why? Is that...
is that a problem?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.401
Yes, that's a problem.

06:42.403 --> 06:44.469
I don't have a bank account.

06:46.172 --> 06:48.673
I keep all my money offshore.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.742
In a lobster buoy.

06:51.844 --> 06:53.512
Uh... I don't think
we have that kind of

06:53.514 --> 06:55.680
cash in the...
in the office.
But we can
go to the...

06:55.682 --> 06:57.349
All right.

06:57.351 --> 06:59.251
All right, I'll
tell you what.

06:59.253 --> 07:01.353
Since your old man
is a friend of ours,

07:01.355 --> 07:02.854
we'll call it even.

07:02.856 --> 07:05.690
But at some time in the future,

07:05.692 --> 07:09.461
I may come to you
and ask for a favor.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.431
Sure.
Yeah, sure.

07:12.433 --> 07:16.034
<i>A capilozi vigamo.</i>

07:16.036 --> 07:18.203
(laughs):
I mean...

07:18.205 --> 07:19.571
That was easy.

07:19.573 --> 07:21.873
Yeah, I-I guess I was
worried for nothing.

07:21.875 --> 07:24.009
Remember that time...

07:26.546 --> 07:29.414
...that I said I may come back
and ask for a favor?

07:29.416 --> 07:31.550
Yeah.
Yeah.

07:31.552 --> 07:34.019
Well, that time has come.

07:39.892 --> 07:41.393
I'm in for ten.

07:41.395 --> 07:42.394
I call.

07:42.396 --> 07:44.095
Call.
Fold.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.397
So this was
the favor?

07:45.399 --> 07:47.232
Yeah. They just wanted
a place to play poker.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.233
JOHNNY:
Hey.

07:48.235 --> 07:49.968
I want to thank you guys

07:49.970 --> 07:51.903
for letting us
use your place.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.238
Oh.
Salut.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.140
Salut.
Salut.
Yeah.

07:56.976 --> 07:58.910
(exhales)

07:58.912 --> 08:01.880
(gagging)

08:03.115 --> 08:05.450
You know, ever since
our last three places

08:05.452 --> 08:08.787
burned down in mysterious
yet unsolvable circumstances,

08:08.789 --> 08:11.923
it's been tough
to get a game together.

08:11.925 --> 08:13.592
How could we refuse?

08:13.594 --> 08:14.993
(laughs)
Yeah.

08:14.995 --> 08:17.162
You couldn't.

08:18.097 --> 08:19.965
Salut.

08:19.967 --> 08:21.032
Salut.

08:23.102 --> 08:24.302
(exhales):
Yah...

08:24.304 --> 08:26.838
Oh, okay.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.006
Mmm, yeah.

08:28.008 --> 08:29.307
(exhales):
Ah...
Uh-huh.

08:29.309 --> 08:30.775
Yes.
Yeah!

08:30.777 --> 08:31.943
Edna.

08:31.945 --> 08:32.944
Where have you been?

08:32.946 --> 08:34.613
Hiding.

08:34.615 --> 08:36.615
Edna no like Italians.

08:36.617 --> 08:37.949
Shh.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.317
What? Why not?

08:39.319 --> 08:42.287
They come to this country,
no learn English

08:42.289 --> 08:44.356
and take all the jobs.

08:45.958 --> 08:47.959
I just hope they wrap
it up before somebody

08:47.961 --> 08:49.961
says something that
could offend them.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.963
So I bought my ma one of them
medical alert bracelets,

08:51.965 --> 08:53.965
just in case anything
should happen, God forbid.

08:53.967 --> 08:55.033
God forbid.
God forbid.
God forbid.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.034
There is no God.

08:56.036 --> 08:57.502
MEN:
Oh!

08:57.504 --> 08:59.704
(fake laughing)

08:59.706 --> 09:02.507
Ha ha ha, he's just
kidding, obviously.

09:02.509 --> 09:04.576
Look at that face.

09:06.379 --> 09:08.813
Oh, yeah,
I get it now.

09:08.815 --> 09:10.982
So, Shecky, why don't
you sit down at the table,

09:10.984 --> 09:11.983
play a few hands?

09:11.985 --> 09:13.685
No thanks.

09:13.687 --> 09:15.754
Gambling's for morons.
No offense.

09:18.057 --> 09:21.026
Well, I'll play.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.562
Uh, no, Dad. You actually need
money to play in a poker game.

09:23.564 --> 09:25.630
Ah.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.402
How about you,
troll on the end of a pencil?

09:33.172 --> 09:35.073
Uh...

09:35.075 --> 09:38.076
Yeah. Yeah, okay,
I'll play a few games.

09:38.078 --> 09:39.411
What?

09:39.413 --> 09:41.046
Yeah, dude.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.615
It's an honor to sit in
a mob poker game.

09:46.085 --> 09:47.719
He's right.

09:47.721 --> 09:49.888
You know, we had several of
those Make-A-Wish kids sit in.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.390
You know, the smiles on their
faces make them almost forget

09:52.392 --> 09:55.026
they're about to get
whacked by God.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.761
There is no God.

09:56.763 --> 09:57.829
MEN:
Oh!

09:59.398 --> 10:02.734
How about you, chipmunk head?

10:02.736 --> 10:05.203
You want to sit in,
or are you too busy

10:05.205 --> 10:08.873
gathering nuts for
the long winter months ahead?

10:08.875 --> 10:12.043
Uh, yeah, you know,
I-I really shouldn't.

10:12.045 --> 10:15.246
My-my wife Camila has me
on an allowance, so I...

10:15.248 --> 10:17.248
An allowance?
Yeah.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.251
I guess your wife has been
gathering your nuts.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.319
(laughter)

10:32.231 --> 10:34.232
Hey, let me help you.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.233
No!

10:35.235 --> 10:37.302
You no take my job!

10:38.404 --> 10:40.105
(speaking Spanish)

10:40.107 --> 10:41.106
No.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.708
No!
Whoa!

10:45.411 --> 10:47.312
(slurring):
Okay!

10:49.915 --> 10:51.082
Salut!

10:51.084 --> 10:52.817
(laughs)

10:52.819 --> 10:54.085
All right.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.755
I see your 20--
here you go--

10:56.757 --> 10:58.623
and I raise you $100.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.258
Sounds like you got
a pretty good hand.

11:00.260 --> 11:02.093
Oh, yeah.

11:02.095 --> 11:03.428
(laughing)

11:03.430 --> 11:05.497
All in.

11:13.005 --> 11:14.506
All in?
(stammers)

11:14.508 --> 11:16.107
I don't...
I don't have as-as much...

11:16.109 --> 11:18.677
many, um, uh... chips as you.

11:20.813 --> 11:22.313
I'll tell you what.
What?

11:22.315 --> 11:25.316
You win, you get
all the money on the table.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.952
I win, I get...

11:27.954 --> 11:29.621
your company.

11:29.623 --> 11:32.123
Aw, you want
to hang out with me?

11:32.125 --> 11:35.160
Yeah. Yeah.
I am good company.

11:35.162 --> 11:39.130
No, no, no, your business,
your video game company.

11:39.132 --> 11:41.132
Ghost Child? Oh, no.

11:41.134 --> 11:43.034
No, I don't... No, I c... No.

11:43.036 --> 11:45.136
No, I'd have to talk to Eli
about that.

11:45.138 --> 11:46.471
Oh, you hear that?

11:46.473 --> 11:48.640
Chip can't make a move
without checking with Dale.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.709
(men laugh)

11:52.712 --> 11:54.512
I can, too.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.014
All in.

11:56.016 --> 11:59.150
Well, good luck, son.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.885
There's only two hands
that can beat you.

12:00.887 --> 12:02.153
Four aces.

12:02.155 --> 12:04.222
And that's one of 'em.

12:05.858 --> 12:08.493
(panting)

12:08.495 --> 12:10.495
Oh, thank God.

12:10.497 --> 12:12.030
What's the matter,
honey?

12:12.032 --> 12:14.833
Oh, I had the most
insane dream.

12:14.835 --> 12:18.503
Were you an elegant
lady in this one, too?

12:18.505 --> 12:20.839
(knocking)

12:20.841 --> 12:23.007
(screams)

12:23.009 --> 12:24.342
It's a home invasion!

12:24.344 --> 12:26.077
The lady next door
has diamonds

12:26.079 --> 12:29.914
and her alarm password
is "password."

12:29.916 --> 12:32.550
Hey, chipmunk,
you're late for work.

12:32.552 --> 12:35.887
Oh, my God, it
wasn't a dream.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.223
I gambled the company
away to the Mafia.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.024
You what?

12:40.026 --> 12:41.359
Come on, Warner.

12:41.361 --> 12:42.694
You got to get to
work before

12:42.696 --> 12:44.829
all the good tracksuits
are taken.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.103
Where do you get off
gambling away

12:52.105 --> 12:54.372
my half of the company?!

12:54.374 --> 12:57.075
Eli, I-I...
you know, I was drunk.

12:57.077 --> 12:58.109
And-and I was up

12:58.111 --> 13:01.613
eight dollars
before I-I lost the company.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.916
And I d... you know,
I-I really don't think

13:04.918 --> 13:06.618
that much has changed.

13:13.092 --> 13:16.761
My desk is now a stripper pole?

13:16.763 --> 13:19.230
We all make mistakes, all right?

13:19.232 --> 13:22.667
You remember l-last year when
you messed up my lunch order?

13:25.104 --> 13:27.071
You lost our company!

13:27.073 --> 13:29.307
You don't know
what rye bread is!

13:32.411 --> 13:37.148
Warner, you got to get all
of this out of here now.

13:40.452 --> 13:43.855
How 'bout a dance, big boy?

13:45.658 --> 13:47.926
Warner, you have got
to get everyone except her

13:47.928 --> 13:49.194
out of here right now.

13:49.929 --> 13:52.130
Hey. What-what's your name?

13:52.132 --> 13:54.199
White Wine.
Yeah, it is.

13:55.935 --> 13:57.836
Hey,

13:57.838 --> 14:01.439
where do you guys keep
your cocaine scale?

14:01.441 --> 14:05.944
Johnny, Johnny,
we-we got to talk.

14:05.946 --> 14:06.978
Sure thing.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.813
I got an open-door policy.

14:08.815 --> 14:10.515
Unless it's a complaint.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.817
Then I got an open
window policy.

14:12.819 --> 14:14.953
Right, fellas?

14:14.955 --> 14:17.288
Oh, they're all out back.
Hey, guys, give me an "Oh!"

14:17.290 --> 14:19.390
MEN:
Oh!

14:20.359 --> 14:21.960
Johnny, I...

14:21.962 --> 14:24.128
You-you have to give us back
our company,

14:24.130 --> 14:26.497
and-and I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

14:26.499 --> 14:30.201
What exactly
are you trying to say?

14:30.970 --> 14:33.805
Look, this-this is our company.

14:33.807 --> 14:35.640
Mine and Eli's.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.176
We never signed
a contract with you.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.478
There-there are rules
to business, my friend.

14:40.480 --> 14:41.880
Rules.

14:41.882 --> 14:43.815
Now, look,
I-I don't want

14:43.817 --> 14:47.385
to scare you, but if you don't
give us back our company,

14:47.387 --> 14:49.754
you'll be getting a letter.

14:51.557 --> 14:54.392
<i>Capisce?</i>

14:54.394 --> 14:57.395
I say <i>"capisce"</i> to people.
Nobody says <i>"capisce"</i> to me.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.997
<i>Capisce?</i>

14:58.999 --> 15:02.400
No, I don't <i>capisce! Capisce?!</i>

15:02.402 --> 15:05.770
Did you just <i>double-capisce</i> me,
you son of a bitch?!

15:07.206 --> 15:10.975
It's time for you
to leave, Johnny.

15:13.012 --> 15:15.179
If that's the way you feel.

15:15.181 --> 15:18.249
I appreciate your honesty.

15:22.221 --> 15:24.055
Hey, you know what?

15:24.057 --> 15:26.024
Let's go for a ride.

15:26.026 --> 15:27.025
A ride?

15:27.027 --> 15:29.093
Warner, run!

15:36.035 --> 15:38.069
I can't believe they
took my best friend.

15:38.071 --> 15:39.537
I know.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.073
I can't believe
you let them.

15:42.075 --> 15:44.409
Let them? What was
I supposed to do?

15:44.411 --> 15:45.877
They're bigger than me.

15:45.879 --> 15:47.211
Everybody's bigger than you.

15:47.213 --> 15:49.247
Really? Now?

15:49.249 --> 15:52.717
Okay, I got Johnny's
cell phone number.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.887
I'm sure we can
reason with him.

15:55.889 --> 15:57.055
JOHNNY (recorded):
This is Johnny.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.122
If you're calling
to reason with me,

15:58.124 --> 16:00.191
forget about it.

16:01.727 --> 16:04.562
Well, I don't care if we have
to drive down every street

16:04.564 --> 16:07.065
in this city,
we're gonna go find him.

16:07.067 --> 16:09.500
Eli, I can tell you
where they're going.

16:14.740 --> 16:17.041
We really bonded
at that lap dance.

16:18.243 --> 16:22.113
Johnny has a warehouse
at the end of Anchor Avenue.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.081
I can take you there.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.483
No, White Wine,
you stay here.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.318
And try to...

16:27.320 --> 16:30.555
try to get those last two
ping-pong balls out, okay?

16:40.599 --> 16:42.934
Hey, did-did I ever
tell you that

16:42.936 --> 16:46.270
in high school, I was voted Most
Likely to Gladly Change My Name

16:46.272 --> 16:48.573
and-and Move to Another Country?

16:52.778 --> 16:55.646
This <i>fugacci</i> computer
says we're in the ocean.

16:55.648 --> 16:57.982
Oh, yeah, you just have
to, uh, uh, download

16:57.984 --> 17:00.118
the-the latest operating system
and, uh...

17:00.120 --> 17:02.620
and-and upgrade the interface.

17:02.622 --> 17:05.857
Who are you,
Bill Nye the Science <i>Squalootz?</i>

17:05.859 --> 17:09.160
(laughs):
That's funny.

17:09.162 --> 17:11.863
Do you mind if I...
do you mind if I try to fix it?

17:11.865 --> 17:13.531
Yeah, okay.

17:13.533 --> 17:14.966
Yeah, let me just, uh...

17:14.968 --> 17:17.468
(beeping)

17:17.470 --> 17:19.637
A second to reboot.
Yeah, there it is.

17:19.639 --> 17:22.206
Hey, you're pretty good
at this computer crap.
Yeah.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.175
You ever think about starting
your own business?

17:24.177 --> 17:28.846
Well, I did, but the, uh...
the Mafia took it over.

17:28.848 --> 17:31.215
Oh, right, right.
Sorry.

17:31.217 --> 17:34.552
Sometimes you forget the reason
you're about to whack somebody.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.987
Tell me about it.

17:35.989 --> 17:38.990
I've had this string tied
around my finger for two months.

17:38.992 --> 17:43.895
Somebody's walking around
unstrangled-- I don't know.

17:46.832 --> 17:49.567
Eli, what exactly is your plan
when we get there?

17:49.569 --> 17:51.402
I don't know. Do you
think we can lure them

17:51.404 --> 17:53.004
into a house of mirrors?

17:53.006 --> 17:53.905
(groans)

17:53.907 --> 17:57.575
Why do I have to come?
He's not my son.

17:58.677 --> 18:00.912
Crawford, Johnny's your friend.
Mm-hmm.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.181
I mean, you don't think he'd
actually hurt Warner, right?

18:03.183 --> 18:05.583
I don't know.
You know, Johnny talks big,

18:05.585 --> 18:08.086
but the worst thing
I've ever seen him do

18:08.088 --> 18:09.587
is strangle a racehorse.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.760
Nobody insults Johnny Johnny
DeSalvo DeSalvo

18:15.762 --> 18:17.261
and lives to talk about it.

18:17.263 --> 18:18.529
MEN:
Yeah!

18:18.531 --> 18:21.365
Any last words before you sleep
with the fishes?

18:21.367 --> 18:25.103
ELI: Yeah. Let
our friend go.

18:28.540 --> 18:32.877
What are you <i>gambrozzis </i>
<i>doing here?</i>

18:32.879 --> 18:36.614
Wait, uh, is
<i>"gambrozzis"</i> a bad thing?

18:36.616 --> 18:39.617
It's a neutral term.

18:39.619 --> 18:41.619
Okay. Good.

18:41.621 --> 18:42.887
Well, we came
for Warner!

18:42.889 --> 18:43.955
Yeah!

18:45.424 --> 18:47.391
Hey, guys.

18:47.393 --> 18:49.894
What are you doing here?
Warner! (exhales)

18:49.896 --> 18:51.796
We thought
they were gonna whack you.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.264
JOHNNY:
Yeah, yeah,

18:53.266 --> 18:55.233
we were, but then, uh,
chipmunk-head here said

18:55.235 --> 18:59.904
he could hook up my intranet
with five-point-oh!

18:59.906 --> 19:02.440
Yeah, these guys were
in the Stone Ages.

19:02.442 --> 19:05.643
Th-This guy here thought Google
was a type of bird.

19:05.645 --> 19:07.078
(laughs)

19:07.080 --> 19:10.081
I-It's true, I did.
I don't know.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.750
Wait, if-if you aren't mad
at Warner,

19:12.752 --> 19:14.318
then who were you threatening?

19:15.754 --> 19:17.889
Please help me!

19:20.092 --> 19:23.794
Warner hooked up this, uh,
new program called Skippy.

19:23.796 --> 19:25.229
Skype.

19:30.936 --> 19:32.503
Makes my life so much easier.

19:32.505 --> 19:36.841
Now I can sit around whacking
in my pajamas all day.

19:38.477 --> 19:42.113
I got to get a computer.

19:42.115 --> 19:45.950
Wait, Mr. DeSalvo, it-it sounds
like Warner did you a favor.

19:45.952 --> 19:48.786
Doesn't that mean
you owe him one?

19:48.788 --> 19:52.023
I suppose it does,
my little lotus blossom.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.963
Warner, you can have
your company back.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.032
(chuckles)

20:02.167 --> 20:05.169
Johnny...

20:05.171 --> 20:07.805
you know,
beneath all that bluster,

20:07.807 --> 20:09.173
you got a giant heart.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.475
You're a good man,

20:11.477 --> 20:13.744
and I'm proud
to call you friend.

20:14.713 --> 20:16.781
Come here.
(chuckles)

20:18.483 --> 20:20.218
Isn't anybody gonna do anything?

20:20.220 --> 20:21.552
Hey!

20:21.554 --> 20:23.654
You bet on the Bucks
and you lost, you scumbag.

20:23.656 --> 20:24.989
So just sit still,

20:24.991 --> 20:27.124
and somebody will be there
to whack you shortly.

20:35.167 --> 20:36.834
(Johnny's voice):
Hey, you <i>gambrozzis,</i>

20:36.836 --> 20:38.669
I'm Meatball,
the talking meatball,

20:38.671 --> 20:40.171
and I'm in a video game.

20:40.173 --> 20:43.241
It's funny, right?

20:44.176 --> 20:46.010
It is kind of funny.

20:46.012 --> 20:48.246
I can't believe this tested
higher than any character

20:48.248 --> 20:50.314
we've ever created.

20:53.018 --> 20:57.021
I'll be your consigliere on your
journey from bag boy to don.

20:57.023 --> 20:59.857
So grab your whatchamacallit,
uh, controller?

20:59.859 --> 21:01.692
My sister's kid could tell you.

21:01.694 --> 21:04.362
All day long
with these video game machines.

21:04.364 --> 21:06.030
He's got diabetes.

21:06.032 --> 21:09.100
The good kind, thank God.

21:10.702 --> 21:13.704
And then it basically goes on
like that for the next 40 hours.

21:13.706 --> 21:15.206
Wow.

21:15.208 --> 21:17.375
Hey. Where'd you get
that fur coat?

21:17.377 --> 21:18.442
Mind your business.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.713
Our place just looks
so boring now.

21:22.715 --> 21:24.081
What happened
to all the bada-bling?

21:24.083 --> 21:25.082
Yeah, I got rid of it.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.083
All of it?

21:26.085 --> 21:28.252
Every last piece.

21:28.254 --> 21:31.689
(rock music playing)

21:39.464 --> 21:41.532
(music ends)

21:44.736 --> 21:47.071
My turn!
(music resumes)
