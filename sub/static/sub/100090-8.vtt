WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.876
- Wait until I tell Kev,
"The movie you've been

00:06.919 --> 00:09.139
raving about is the worst movie
I've seen in my entire life."

00:09.183 --> 00:11.968
I grinned and I beared it,
you know?

00:12.012 --> 00:13.535
- Oh, well.

00:13.578 --> 00:15.798
I hate to tell you this, like
it pains me to tell you this,

00:15.841 --> 00:17.278
but you snore.

00:17.321 --> 00:19.628
- See, I'm never watching
a movie on your couch again.

00:19.671 --> 00:21.325
God forbid, I nod off.

00:21.369 --> 00:23.284
- No, man. I think it's called
passing out

00:23.327 --> 00:25.025
when you've had more than,
what?

00:25.068 --> 00:27.592
Four Pilsners?

00:27.636 --> 00:29.333
- All right, here we go.
- Okay.

00:29.377 --> 00:31.031
Gimme.

00:32.467 --> 00:34.034
- Okay, heads-up, everyone.

00:34.077 --> 00:35.600
Source is coming your way.

00:35.644 --> 00:37.689
Plates are confirmed.
Truck's double loaded.

00:37.733 --> 00:38.995
- Copy that.
We're in position

00:39.039 --> 00:40.344
Shutting down.

00:44.740 --> 00:46.220
- Good to see you boys.

00:46.263 --> 00:47.786
- Yeah, glad we can make
this happen.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.310
Y'all got what we ordered?

00:53.662 --> 00:57.057
- Yeah, three bricks.
It's perfect.

00:58.536 --> 01:00.582
As long as the product
is right.

01:01.235 --> 01:02.584
It's right.

01:02.627 --> 01:04.107
- Okay, no offense,

01:04.151 --> 01:05.891
but the last cat
who told us that it was right

01:05.935 --> 01:07.589
sold us 50% sham,

01:07.632 --> 01:10.113
and we don't need no heroin
that's already stepped on.

01:11.941 --> 01:14.204
Is that pure?

01:19.122 --> 01:21.081
It's pure.
- Hmm.

01:21.124 --> 01:23.083
- Hey!

01:23.126 --> 01:24.606
Don't step any closer, homie.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.086
I don't see no paper.

01:29.089 --> 01:31.178
I wanna make sure
you're for real.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.309
- Okay.

01:35.182 --> 01:36.705
Chicago PD.

01:38.272 --> 01:40.361
- Hey,
don't even think about it!

01:40.404 --> 01:41.579
Put your hands up.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.233
- We got one going out
the back.

01:43.277 --> 01:45.366
Green jacket, dark jeans.
He's taking off with the dope.

01:45.409 --> 01:47.237
- We're on it.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.157
- Chicago PD!

02:12.654 --> 02:14.221
- Stop.

02:14.264 --> 02:16.788
Get your hands up.
Get your hands up!

02:16.832 --> 02:18.573
Drop the bag.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.401
Put your arms through the gate.

02:35.894 --> 02:38.810
- 5021 Eddie, roll the Crime
Lab to Calumet Corridor.

02:38.854 --> 02:41.378
We have a female DOA,
possible homicide.

02:41.422 --> 02:43.119
Make all the appropriate
notifications,

02:43.163 --> 02:45.948
and advise our supervisor
we are securing the scene.

02:45.991 --> 02:48.168
- 10-4, 5021 Eddie.

02:51.519 --> 02:53.347
- All right, what do we got?

02:53.390 --> 02:56.350
- No ID on the vic,
not in the system.

02:56.393 --> 02:58.395
- There's a park
a few blocks east of here.

02:58.439 --> 02:59.875
It's popular
with working girls.

02:59.918 --> 03:03.183
They use this area as a place
to conduct their business.

03:03.226 --> 03:04.445
- She wasn't here too long.

03:04.488 --> 03:05.837
The M.E. framed
the time of death

03:05.881 --> 03:07.056
within the last 12 hours.

03:07.099 --> 03:08.623
No signs of fresh blood
on the scene.

03:08.666 --> 03:10.973
- It's a dump site.
- Yeah.

03:11.016 --> 03:12.540
And if she was a prostitute,

03:12.583 --> 03:15.020
we're assuming the offender
probably killed her in the car

03:15.064 --> 03:16.544
and brought her here.

03:16.587 --> 03:18.676
- All right, scour the area
for PODs, security cameras.

03:18.720 --> 03:21.113
Circulate her photo,
check all missings,

03:21.157 --> 03:22.332
look for any witnesses,

03:22.376 --> 03:24.508
and we start talking
to prostitutes.

03:24.552 --> 03:26.554
- We're gonna take it?
Not Homicide?

03:26.597 --> 03:29.557
- We found her.
Let's find her killer.

03:29.600 --> 03:31.776
- Okay.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.125
- Hey.

03:33.169 --> 03:34.388
- Hey.
- What happened to you?

03:34.431 --> 03:36.259
- Uh, snagged it on a gate
back there.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.218
I'll live.
- I'm sure you will.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.654
All the same, I want you
to head over to Med,

03:39.697 --> 03:41.395
get it checked out,
document it.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.266
These guys can handle
the canvassing.

03:43.310 --> 03:45.399
- Okay, copy.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.533
- You're all set.
- I am?

03:49.577 --> 03:51.143
- Mm-hmm.
- Ugh.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.362
Thank you.

03:55.278 --> 03:57.237
Thanks.
- You're welcome.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.238
- Doctor.

03:58.281 --> 04:00.414
- Hmm.

04:02.067 --> 04:03.895
Ah.

04:03.939 --> 04:05.375
- Is something wrong?

04:05.419 --> 04:06.768
- I ran a standard blood panel.

04:06.811 --> 04:08.378
No infections,
nothing to worry about.

04:08.422 --> 04:09.858
- Oh, okay.
I was, like, worried.

04:09.901 --> 04:13.557
- But due to your elevated
levels of beta HCG,

04:13.601 --> 04:15.907
you should be more careful
on the job.

04:15.951 --> 04:18.170
- Elevated H-B-what?

04:18.214 --> 04:19.476
- It means you're pregnant.

04:19.520 --> 04:21.652
Probably around four weeks.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.702
- Are you sure?
- 100%.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.007
Maybe don't
go squeezing through

04:29.051 --> 04:30.531
any more fences for a while,

04:30.574 --> 04:32.750
and congratulations.

04:44.327 --> 04:46.242
- Hey, how's it going?
Are you okay?

04:46.286 --> 04:48.157
- Good as new.

04:48.200 --> 04:49.898
- You're cool?
- Yeah.

04:49.941 --> 04:51.247
- Where we at?

04:51.291 --> 04:52.988
- So our Jane Doe

04:53.031 --> 04:54.772
had a distinctive birthmark
on her thigh.

04:54.816 --> 04:56.252
We ran that through
Missing Persons

04:56.296 --> 04:57.253
and we got a hit.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.428
Her name is Ally Larson.

04:58.472 --> 04:59.951
- Ally ran away from home
eight years ago

04:59.995 --> 05:01.475
when she was 16.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.520
Since then, she's been a ghost.
No address, no workplace.

05:03.564 --> 05:05.696
- All right, which might make
sense if she was a prostitute.

05:05.740 --> 05:07.045
- Maybe.

05:07.089 --> 05:08.308
She's got no arrest record,

05:08.351 --> 05:09.787
and I just spoke to
some of the working girls.

05:09.831 --> 05:11.398
None of them
recognize her photo.

05:11.441 --> 05:13.617
- So maybe not.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.315
- All right,
anything from the M.E.?

05:15.358 --> 05:16.968
- No signs of sexual assault.

05:17.012 --> 05:19.841
He said Ally was hit repeatedly
with a blunt object.

05:19.884 --> 05:22.365
- Yeah, no surprise there.
Defensive wounds?

05:22.409 --> 05:23.758
- No.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.455
- Huh, so she didn't
see it coming.

05:25.499 --> 05:26.674
- But there were signs
of scarring

05:26.717 --> 05:28.066
around the wrists and ankles,

05:28.110 --> 05:30.155
which apparently restraints
would have to be left on

05:30.199 --> 05:33.158
for an extended period of time
to leave those marks.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.551
- Hmm.

05:34.595 --> 05:37.032
So maybe she was being held
against her will.

05:37.075 --> 05:39.382
- Yeah, it's a possibility.

05:39.426 --> 05:40.775
- Anything else?

05:40.818 --> 05:42.777
- There was a strand of hair
lodged in her necklace.

05:42.820 --> 05:45.475
Not hers--they're testing it
now for DNA.

05:45.519 --> 05:46.998
- Okay, anything from PODs
or surveillance?

05:47.042 --> 05:49.392
- Uh, waiting for digital files
on Townshend Auto Parts.

05:49.436 --> 05:50.524
They had a cam set up
pretty close

05:50.567 --> 05:51.655
to where we found
Ally's body.

05:51.699 --> 05:53.265
- Okay, so let's keep digging.

05:53.309 --> 05:56.225
See what we can find in Ally's
missing persons report.

05:56.268 --> 05:57.531
Kim and Adam?

05:57.574 --> 05:59.794
Make the notification
to the parents.

06:03.537 --> 06:06.017
- We both dreaded this day.

06:06.061 --> 06:08.890
I told myself
it would never happen.

06:09.499 --> 06:12.589
- You pray every night
your baby will come home.

06:12.633 --> 06:15.375
Will walk through that door
and not the police.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.986
- We're so extremely sorry
for your loss.

06:18.029 --> 06:20.554
We're here to try and find
the person responsible.

06:21.990 --> 06:25.254
Our records indicate Ally
ran away eight years ago.

06:25.297 --> 06:27.082
- She didn't run away.

06:27.125 --> 06:28.823
- Okay.

06:28.866 --> 06:32.609
- We had a fight
and she ran out.

06:32.653 --> 06:34.524
It was just a fight.

06:34.568 --> 06:37.397
We had lot of fights.
She always came back.

06:39.747 --> 06:44.099
We looked for her afterwards,
couldn't find her.

06:45.448 --> 06:48.451
Somebody took my daughter.

06:50.018 --> 06:52.455
- Okay, do you have any idea
who that might be?

06:52.499 --> 06:54.631
Like a boyfriend or someone--

06:54.675 --> 06:59.070
- I've asked myself that
a thousand times,

06:59.114 --> 07:00.550
but no.

07:00.594 --> 07:02.422
She got along with everyone.

07:03.901 --> 07:06.077
It had to have been a stranger.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.691
About a year ago,

07:10.734 --> 07:13.824
we were headed to the flower
show at Garfield Park.

07:14.956 --> 07:18.133
And we drove past a playground,

07:18.176 --> 07:21.441
and there she was, Ally.

07:23.530 --> 07:27.577
It was seven years
since I saw her,

07:27.621 --> 07:29.797
but it was my baby.

07:30.754 --> 07:33.322
She was sitting next to a man,

07:33.365 --> 07:35.498
and I begged Robert
to turn around.

07:35.542 --> 07:37.892
- But I didn't.

07:37.935 --> 07:40.416
I, uh...

07:40.460 --> 07:43.201
I got upset instead.

07:43.245 --> 07:45.595
I thought Anne was delusional.

07:45.639 --> 07:47.467
That's why I didn't call
the cops.

07:48.206 --> 07:50.121
- On the man,
what did he look like?

07:50.165 --> 07:52.341
- I wish I could tell you.

07:52.384 --> 07:54.952
I was fixated on my daughter.

07:54.996 --> 07:58.173
It was December; he had
a hat on and was bundled up.

07:58.216 --> 07:59.696
I was in shock.

08:04.222 --> 08:06.311
If only we'd turned around.

08:11.229 --> 08:14.537
- Hey, I just got surveillance
back from the auto parts shop.

08:14.581 --> 08:16.147
So check it out.
- All right.

08:16.191 --> 08:19.063
- We got a male in a red camo
jacket dragging Ally's body.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.414
This is eight hours
before we found her.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.504
So then the guy runs off,

08:24.547 --> 08:26.723
and then headlights.

08:27.594 --> 08:29.813
So I check traffic cams
leaving in and out of the area.

08:29.857 --> 08:31.162
Two minutes later, same guy.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.077
Street POD caught him
at Cicero and 6th.

08:33.121 --> 08:34.818
Got a hit on facial rec.

08:34.862 --> 08:36.298
Say hi to Ramiro Lopez.

08:36.341 --> 08:38.343
He's a mid-level dealer
with the Insane Players,

08:38.387 --> 08:40.520
runs a corner a few blocks from
where we found Ally's body.

08:40.563 --> 08:43.131
He's out on parole for distro,
has one prior for domestic.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.046
He's been staying with
his cousin in Archer Heights,

08:45.089 --> 08:47.527
low-income apartments
on Pulaski.

08:47.570 --> 08:50.573
- Let's get some cuffs
on this guy.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.534
Jay and I just pulled up.

08:54.577 --> 08:56.579
You in place, Kev?

08:56.623 --> 08:57.841
- Yup.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.843
We got eyes on the front
and Lopez's car.

08:59.887 --> 09:01.497
He should be in the house.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.194
- All right, copy.

09:08.025 --> 09:09.287
- Wait, hold on.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.293
That's him.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.295
- We got eyes on the offender
approaching the vehicle.

09:20.298 --> 09:22.605
Ramiro Lopez?

09:22.649 --> 09:23.693
Chicago PD.

09:25.347 --> 09:27.567
- Hey!
- Damn!

09:31.048 --> 09:33.747
- 5021 Frank, in pursuit
of a silver Cadillac,

09:33.790 --> 09:36.097
Illinois plate
Tom Charlie Sam 232.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.909
Hey!

10:07.302 --> 10:10.348
- Get off me, bitch!
- Shut up and stop moving!

10:10.392 --> 10:11.698
- Call her a bitch again.

10:15.963 --> 10:18.835
Ramiro Lopez, you're
getting sloppy, ain't you?

10:18.879 --> 10:20.881
We found a kilo of heroin
in your trunk.

10:20.924 --> 10:23.405
- That ain't mine.
I'm out the game.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.625
- Oh, that's why you ran, huh?

10:25.668 --> 10:28.062
- Where were you last night?

10:28.105 --> 10:29.324
- I was out.

10:29.367 --> 10:30.760
- Out where?

10:30.804 --> 10:32.457
- Hanging with some of my boys.

10:32.501 --> 10:35.635
- Hmm, you know a woman
named Ally Larson?

10:36.636 --> 10:38.333
- Never heard of her.
- No?

10:39.813 --> 10:42.685
Maybe that'll
refresh your memory.

10:42.729 --> 10:45.645
I'll give you a hint.
Ally's the dead one.

10:46.602 --> 10:48.038
Ramiro...

10:48.082 --> 10:51.389
You come clean to me right now,
I can help you.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.915
- That ain't me.
- No?

10:58.658 --> 10:59.920
- That's clearly you,

10:59.963 --> 11:01.922
six blocks away from the body.

11:01.965 --> 11:04.838
Ramiro, it's over.

11:05.795 --> 11:08.493
- All right, for real.

11:08.537 --> 11:10.626
Yeah, I'm back in business.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.323
I was looking
for one of my crew

11:12.367 --> 11:14.891
when I see that white dude
standing over the girl.

11:14.935 --> 11:17.241
He sees me, he jumps in
his car, and he takes off.

11:17.285 --> 11:18.765
- What did that white dude
look like?

11:18.808 --> 11:20.723
- Uh, he was short.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.246
Uh, brown hair, maybe.

11:22.290 --> 11:24.466
- What kind of car
was he driving?

11:24.509 --> 11:26.076
- Uh...

11:26.120 --> 11:29.732
a--a blue SUV
with a big dent on the side.

11:29.776 --> 11:31.038
It was a Nissan, I think.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.909
- Then what happened?

11:32.953 --> 11:34.955
- Listen, I don't know
if dude was raping

11:34.998 --> 11:36.086
or robbing that lady.

11:36.130 --> 11:37.740
I thought she was knocked
the hell out.

11:37.784 --> 11:39.699
So I dragged her
into the light.

11:40.874 --> 11:43.311
I wanted to help her.

11:43.354 --> 11:45.617
But then I saw her head
smashed in like a baby seal,

11:45.661 --> 11:47.881
and I got the hell up
out of there.

11:52.755 --> 11:54.583
- Hell of a story.

11:54.626 --> 11:56.541
- So crazy,
I damn near believe it.

11:56.585 --> 11:58.718
- Sarge, lab results came in.

11:58.761 --> 12:00.545
DNA from the hair
in Ally's necklace

12:00.589 --> 12:02.069
matched a name in the system.

12:02.112 --> 12:03.592
- Lopez?

12:03.635 --> 12:05.202
- No, Claire Meyers,
open cold case.

12:05.246 --> 12:07.727
Abducted seven years ago
when she was 17,

12:07.770 --> 12:09.903
but the lab confirmed
the DNA was fresh.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.469
- So Claire might still
be alive?

12:12.993 --> 12:14.734
- That hair didn't
just magically appear.

12:14.777 --> 12:16.344
- Sarge.
- Huh?

12:16.387 --> 12:18.912
- We know that Ally Larson had
restraint marks on her body.

12:18.955 --> 12:20.740
Her parents are convinced
that she was abducted.

12:20.783 --> 12:22.089
I mean, what if they're right?

12:22.132 --> 12:25.048
What if both girls were taken
but by the same guy?

12:25.092 --> 12:27.224
- You're thinking
Claire Meyers and Ally Larson

12:27.268 --> 12:29.313
were being held together
this whole time?

12:29.357 --> 12:31.794
- I do, and Claire
is out there somewhere.

12:34.623 --> 12:36.407
- Then we need to find her.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.371
- This is Claire Meyers.

12:43.414 --> 12:44.938
She was a good student,
aspiring musician,

12:44.981 --> 12:46.243
only daughter of a single mom.

12:46.287 --> 12:48.811
Abducted seven years ago
when she was only 17.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.073
The offender broke
into her house,

12:50.117 --> 12:51.596
dragged her out of bed.

12:51.640 --> 12:53.642
There have been no arrests
and the case has gone cold.

12:53.685 --> 12:55.165
- All right, Ramiro Lopez,

12:55.209 --> 12:57.080
was he listed as a person
of interest in that file?

12:57.124 --> 12:58.342
- Uh, he shouldn't be.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.953
He was locked up
at Stateville for two years

12:59.996 --> 13:01.258
on a possession charge.

13:01.302 --> 13:02.782
- Platt talked to
the original detectives

13:02.825 --> 13:04.087
who were on Claire's case.

13:04.131 --> 13:06.307
- Yeah, they didn't
even have to open the file.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.396
It's one of those cases
that stays with you.

13:08.439 --> 13:11.921
They told us they pressed hard,
but leads went dead fast.

13:11.965 --> 13:13.401
There wasn't a strand
of evidence,

13:13.444 --> 13:15.403
and no visual
or digital trace of her

13:15.446 --> 13:16.317
after that night.

13:16.360 --> 13:17.709
- So she just disappeared.

13:17.753 --> 13:19.711
- Which is why they assumed
whoever abducted Claire

13:19.755 --> 13:21.104
killed her too.

13:21.148 --> 13:24.020
The case shifted from
a locate to a recovery.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.935
- All right,
appreciate it, Trudy.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.371
- We've got
a person of interest here.

13:27.415 --> 13:30.157
John Waddell,
he's Claire's piano teacher.

13:31.375 --> 13:33.160
Claire told her mom
that he was stalking her

13:33.203 --> 13:34.335
and tried to kiss her.

13:34.378 --> 13:35.902
It was enough
for a restraining order.

13:35.945 --> 13:37.207
Two weeks later,
she was abducted.

13:37.251 --> 13:38.469
- Waddell didn't have an alibi,

13:38.513 --> 13:40.080
but because they never
recovered a body,

13:40.123 --> 13:41.864
then they didn't have anything
to connect him

13:41.908 --> 13:43.257
to her disappearance.

13:43.300 --> 13:44.519
- Looks like Waddell
stayed busy.

13:44.562 --> 13:46.260
He got probation
on a Peeping Tom allegation,

13:46.303 --> 13:48.392
and a woman just filed
an assault complaint.

13:48.436 --> 13:51.047
Claims Waddell dropped a roofie
in her drink at a bar.

13:51.091 --> 13:54.050
- Address?
- LKA is 1350 Waycrest.

13:54.094 --> 13:55.878
- Wait,
that's by Garfield Park.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.749
Same park that Ally's mother

13:57.793 --> 13:59.099
swore that she saw
her daughter at.

13:59.142 --> 14:01.666
- All right, Kim,
you and Adam go grab Waddell.

14:01.710 --> 14:05.235
The rest of you, keep digging
into that cold case.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.324
Go over every single piece
of evidence.

14:07.368 --> 14:09.718
These two women who went
missing are connected.

14:09.761 --> 14:12.373
I mean, one of them
may still be alive.

14:12.416 --> 14:14.331
So we move heaven and earth.

14:15.767 --> 14:17.639
- Sarge, we did
a little sneak-and-peek

14:17.682 --> 14:18.901
on Waddell's apartment.

14:18.945 --> 14:20.642
No sign of him or anybody else.

14:20.685 --> 14:23.906
- Keep eyes on the apartment.
We need to find this guy.

14:23.950 --> 14:25.560
- Copy that.

14:26.996 --> 14:28.519
- What?

14:28.563 --> 14:31.044
- My nephew just saw
"Back to the Future"

14:31.087 --> 14:32.436
for the first time,

14:32.480 --> 14:34.134
so he's been trying
to skateboard behind cars

14:34.177 --> 14:35.787
all week long.

14:35.831 --> 14:37.398
I love that kid.

14:37.441 --> 14:40.618
My sister got a lot more than
she bargained for with him.

14:40.662 --> 14:42.229
- I'm pregnant.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.978
- What?

14:52.021 --> 14:53.457
- Yeah, the, um,
the doctor,

14:53.501 --> 14:54.719
she ran some tests

14:54.763 --> 14:56.547
while I was getting
stitched up this morning.

14:56.591 --> 15:00.464
So I am pregnant.

15:03.815 --> 15:06.209
- Is it--
- Yes.

15:06.253 --> 15:08.037
- From the night after--
- Yeah, after that night.

15:08.081 --> 15:09.604
- Okay.

15:09.647 --> 15:11.693
You're sure that--
- I don't need this.

15:11.736 --> 15:12.955
- Okay.
Sorry.

15:12.999 --> 15:14.739
- I'm sure.

15:16.263 --> 15:17.481
Huh.

15:17.525 --> 15:19.483
- Yeah.
- Okay, what do you wanna do?

15:19.527 --> 15:21.094
- I don't know, Adam.
What do you wanna do?

15:21.137 --> 15:22.356
- I don't know.

15:22.399 --> 15:23.835
I'm kind of playing
catch-up over here.

15:23.879 --> 15:26.882
Um...

15:26.926 --> 15:28.449
I mean, do you want a kid?

15:28.492 --> 15:30.625
I know when we were together,
you said you wanted kids.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.583
- I do want kids.

15:33.715 --> 15:36.152
Someday.

15:36.196 --> 15:38.067
- Well...

15:38.111 --> 15:39.764
Okay, well, listen.

15:39.808 --> 15:41.027
You know, whatever you decide,

15:41.070 --> 15:43.681
I'm gonna be there
and I'll support you.

15:43.725 --> 15:44.987
- There he is.

15:57.739 --> 16:00.176
- John.
Hey, it's Waddell, right?

16:00.220 --> 16:01.525
- Yeah.
- Hey.

16:01.569 --> 16:02.831
- Hey.
- Chicago PD.

16:02.874 --> 16:05.225
- We're gonna need you
to come with us, pal.

16:05.268 --> 16:07.053
- You guys don't ever quit,
do you?

16:07.096 --> 16:09.098
- What an incredibly keen
observation, John.

16:09.142 --> 16:11.927
- Let's go.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.538
- Look...

16:14.582 --> 16:16.323
I don't know what else
you people want.

16:16.366 --> 16:18.542
You've already made my life
a living hell.

16:18.586 --> 16:20.283
- Yeah, you know whose life
is a living hell?

16:20.327 --> 16:21.676
It's Claire Meyers' mother.

16:21.719 --> 16:24.766
She hired you as a piano
teacher for her daughter,

16:24.809 --> 16:26.637
found out you were a predator,

16:26.681 --> 16:28.944
and then her daughter
went missing forever.

16:28.988 --> 16:32.078
- I have told you three times,

16:32.121 --> 16:34.689
I had nothing to do with it.

16:34.732 --> 16:36.430
Cops interrogated me.

16:36.473 --> 16:39.476
- Yeah, they never proved
you were innocent.

16:39.520 --> 16:41.739
They just couldn't prove
you were guilty.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.350
- Just for the record,

16:43.393 --> 16:45.656
Claire was the one who
initiated our relationship.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.441
She came onto me.

16:47.484 --> 16:48.746
- Do you recognize this girl?

16:50.705 --> 16:53.273
- No.
- Take another look.

16:53.316 --> 16:55.623
- I can look all day,
but I still don't know her.

16:55.666 --> 16:58.365
- Where were you yesterday
at 9:00 p.m.?

16:58.408 --> 17:01.194
- I was with my mother.
We went to Second City.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.978
It's not as funny
as it used to be.

17:03.674 --> 17:05.285
- According
to the restraining order,

17:05.328 --> 17:08.679
you, uh, stalked Claire
all over the city

17:08.723 --> 17:10.377
before she disappeared.

17:10.420 --> 17:11.813
Maybe you saw her
with someone else,

17:11.856 --> 17:13.728
someone who didn't belong.

17:13.771 --> 17:15.773
- You mean the dude who
was at her soccer games.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.341
- What dude?

17:18.385 --> 17:19.821
- He used to watch
from the parking lot.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.997
Always had a cigarette going,
never talked to anybody.

17:22.041 --> 17:25.087
- Describe him.

17:25.131 --> 17:28.569
- He was white,
older than me.

17:28.612 --> 17:30.092
He had one of
those beat-up panel vans,

17:30.136 --> 17:31.702
like for plumbers
or electricians.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.010
- Why the hell didn't
you tell the cops

17:35.054 --> 17:36.794
about this in the first place?

17:36.838 --> 17:40.276
- I did, but they thought
I was making it up.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.149
Those cops had a vendetta.

17:43.192 --> 17:46.108
They wanted to punish me
because Claire and I

17:46.152 --> 17:48.676
had genuine feelings
for each other.

17:50.156 --> 17:52.636
Why is that so hard
for you people to understand?

18:02.864 --> 18:06.389
- Because she was a 17-year-old
girl, you stupid prick.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.445
- Mm-hmm.

18:18.488 --> 18:20.534
- Sarge,
Waddell's alibi checks out.

18:20.577 --> 18:22.666
He was at a damn comedy club
the night Ally was murdered.

18:22.710 --> 18:23.841
- We got it.

18:23.885 --> 18:25.843
Sarge, we reached out to
the Larson family

18:25.887 --> 18:28.194
to see if they could recall
anybody that had done plumbing

18:28.237 --> 18:30.631
or electrical work at their
house before Ally disappeared.

18:30.674 --> 18:32.067
- Okay.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.156
- They went through
their records.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.158
JBS Electrical did some work
at their house

18:36.202 --> 18:37.986
about a year before
Ally went missing.

18:38.029 --> 18:39.205
- Uh-huh?

18:39.248 --> 18:41.511
- JBS also installed
an air conditioning unit

18:41.555 --> 18:43.557
at Claire Meyers' house
eight years ago.

18:47.126 --> 18:49.040
- We got the nexus.

18:49.737 --> 18:51.695
Look, if this guy
was stalking Claire

18:51.739 --> 18:53.088
for over a year,

18:53.132 --> 18:55.003
there's a good chance
he was stalking Ally too.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.135
He might've even been there

18:56.178 --> 18:57.397
the night she fought
with her parents.

18:57.440 --> 18:59.225
She runs out, upset.

18:59.268 --> 19:01.879
- It was the perfect time
to snatch her up.

19:01.923 --> 19:03.925
- We got the employment records
for JBS?

19:03.968 --> 19:05.231
- We do.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.710
There were two technicians
on the payroll

19:06.754 --> 19:08.016
at the time that
Ally goes missing.

19:08.059 --> 19:10.801
- And one of them owns
a blue Nissan SUV.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.890
- That is Ray Lambert.
He's 40 years old.

19:12.934 --> 19:15.371
He was fired about a year
after Ally went missing.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.504
- Any priors?
- He's squeaky clean

19:17.547 --> 19:19.549
except for one big
social media red flag.

19:19.593 --> 19:21.595
He identifies as an incel.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.249
- What the hell is an incel?

19:23.292 --> 19:24.641
- It's an involuntary celibate.

19:24.685 --> 19:25.860
It's a black hole
on the internet.

19:25.903 --> 19:27.383
It's like white guys
who can't get laid

19:27.427 --> 19:29.298
and think that women
owe them sex.

19:29.342 --> 19:31.735
- Male supremacists.

19:32.867 --> 19:35.217
- Okay, we got an address
for this winner?

19:35.261 --> 19:37.393
- Lambert owns a house
in Forest Park.

19:37.437 --> 19:39.221
- Call CPIC,
get a round-robin.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.483
Let's gear up.

19:40.527 --> 19:42.572
- This is Detective Upton
of Intelligence.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.357
I need real-time information
on a Ray Lambert.

19:44.400 --> 19:46.576
40 years of age,
resides in Forest Park.

19:46.620 --> 19:49.188
He's wanted for abduction
and murder.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.885
- Take it off the hinges.

19:50.928 --> 19:52.321
- Chicago PD!

20:10.861 --> 20:12.559
- Sarge?

20:22.351 --> 20:24.048
- Boss.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.994
- Do you hear that?

20:57.038 --> 20:59.562
Behind the wall.
It sounds like a motor.

21:03.523 --> 21:05.002
- Clear it.

21:18.233 --> 21:20.104
- Hey.
Hey, hey, hey.

21:26.372 --> 21:27.721
- Claire?

21:27.764 --> 21:30.332
Claire, can you look at me?

21:33.379 --> 21:36.120
- I'm putting this gun down,
okay?

21:39.689 --> 21:41.909
Okay?

21:41.952 --> 21:44.390
- I'm Kim.

21:45.521 --> 21:47.349
I know how scared you must be.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.571
I'd like to walk towards you.

21:51.614 --> 21:54.530
If you feel frightened,
you just say "stop," okay?

21:54.574 --> 21:56.184
Can you do that?

21:56.227 --> 21:57.751
Okay.

21:58.708 --> 22:01.276
Can you hand me that, Claire?

22:01.320 --> 22:02.799
It's okay.

22:02.843 --> 22:04.366
I'm just gonna put it
right there.

22:04.410 --> 22:05.889
Does that sound good?

22:05.933 --> 22:07.282
Okay.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.026
Thank you.

22:13.462 --> 22:15.508
I'm gonna sit down now, okay?

22:17.553 --> 22:19.947
Now me and my friends,

22:19.990 --> 22:21.731
we'd like to take you out
of this room.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.167
Do you think you're ready
to do that?

22:23.211 --> 22:25.039
- Where's Henry?

22:25.082 --> 22:26.867
- Who's Henry, Claire?

22:26.910 --> 22:29.957
- He's my son.
Is he with you?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.393
- Your son.

22:31.437 --> 22:34.004
No, he's not, Claire.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.790
- No, wait.
Wait, he took my son.

22:36.833 --> 22:38.400
- Who took your son, Claire?
- He took my son.

22:38.444 --> 22:39.575
- Who took your son?
- Ray.

22:39.619 --> 22:40.837
Ray, he took my son.

22:40.881 --> 22:42.448
- I understand that.
We're gonna get him back.

22:42.491 --> 22:44.014
It's okay.
Take a deep breath, Claire.

22:44.058 --> 22:45.581
- He took my son.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.278
- We're gonna find your son,
Claire.

22:47.322 --> 22:48.410
I'm gonna find your son.

22:48.454 --> 22:50.151
I'm gonna find your son.

22:54.111 --> 22:55.765
- Two rooms, one bathroom,
soundproof walls,

22:55.809 --> 22:56.679
and no way out.

22:56.723 --> 22:57.854
Lambert's a good electrician.

22:57.898 --> 22:59.203
The whole place
is a well-ventilated

22:59.247 --> 23:00.683
house of horrors.
- Three beds suggest

23:00.727 --> 23:01.858
he was holding three victims--

23:01.902 --> 23:02.859
Claire Meyers, Ally Larson,

23:02.903 --> 23:04.208
and Claire's son, Henry.

23:04.252 --> 23:05.558
- And that boy was living
down there too?

23:05.601 --> 23:07.516
- You saw the stuffed animals
and the kid's toys.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.344
- Sarge?
- Yeah.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.215
- Just talked to a neighbor.
He's freaked out.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.043
He thought Lambert
seemed like a stand-up guy.

23:13.087 --> 23:15.219
- He ever see the boy?
- Yeah, all the time.

23:15.263 --> 23:17.004
Lambert said the boy
was his nephew.

23:17.047 --> 23:19.354
- All right, I want
an endangered child AMBER alert

23:19.398 --> 23:21.487
on that boy
immediately... - Henry?

23:21.530 --> 23:23.314
- And a BOLO out
on Lambert now.

23:23.358 --> 23:25.229
- All right.
Yes, sir.

23:25.273 --> 23:27.144
- I--I need to find my son.

23:27.188 --> 23:28.450
I need to find him.
- I've got her...

23:28.494 --> 23:29.886
- I need to find him.
- Claire, look at me.

23:29.930 --> 23:31.061
You're safe now, okay?

23:31.105 --> 23:32.454
Okay, I'm gonna ask you
a few questions.

23:32.498 --> 23:34.195
- I need you to help me
find Henry.

23:34.238 --> 23:35.326
- I will.
Tell me about your son.

23:35.370 --> 23:36.415
How old is he?
- He's four.

23:36.458 --> 23:37.851
- Okay, and you said
that Ray took him?

23:37.894 --> 23:38.982
- Yes.
- When did he take him?

23:39.026 --> 23:40.375
- Today, right before
you got here,

23:40.419 --> 23:42.246
but Ray doesn't know
how to take care of him.

23:42.290 --> 23:44.248
- Do you have any idea where
Ray might've taken your son?

23:44.292 --> 23:45.641
- No.
But Ray is watching.

23:45.685 --> 23:46.816
He's always watching.

23:46.860 --> 23:48.470
- Claire,
he's not watching right now.

23:48.514 --> 23:51.125
- I need to go find my son,
Henry!

23:51.168 --> 23:53.649
I need to go find
my son, Henry!

23:53.693 --> 23:55.129
Henry!
Henry!

23:55.172 --> 23:57.261
I need to find him!

23:57.305 --> 23:59.046
- Henry is four years old,

23:59.089 --> 24:00.482
and Claire was abducted
seven years ago,

24:00.526 --> 24:02.484
which means that monster
is the boy's father.

24:02.528 --> 24:04.007
- All right,
you stay with Claire.

24:04.051 --> 24:05.618
See what else
you can find out.

24:05.661 --> 24:07.054
- Yeah.

24:07.097 --> 24:08.577
- Sarge, we found
a livesteaming camera

24:08.621 --> 24:09.752
mounted in the basement.

24:09.796 --> 24:11.493
This thing can
be controlled remotely.

24:11.537 --> 24:13.843
- So he liked to keep tabs
on his captives.

24:13.887 --> 24:17.368
Also means there's a good
chance he's already onto us.

24:17.412 --> 24:18.718
- Right.

24:18.761 --> 24:20.154
- All right, get the OCD techs
down here right now.

24:20.197 --> 24:21.851
Triangulate this guy.

24:21.895 --> 24:23.462
Whatever it takes
to get him in pocket.

24:23.505 --> 24:24.680
- Copy that.

24:24.724 --> 24:26.290
- All right,
I got into Lambert's computer.

24:26.334 --> 24:29.076
He made a Skype call
two hours before we got here

24:29.119 --> 24:30.469
to this guy, Brad Snyder.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.296
Now judging by the pictures
and the messages

24:32.340 --> 24:33.950
and the Skype link,

24:33.994 --> 24:35.735
they know each other
from the local 542.

24:35.778 --> 24:37.606
And now, this photo...

24:39.521 --> 24:41.436
Brad Snyder has definitely
been in here, boss.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.917
He could be an accomplice.

24:43.960 --> 24:46.006
- Let's go grab him.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.728
- Hey, little homie.

25:12.772 --> 25:14.861
What's up, man?

25:14.904 --> 25:17.037
We're the police.

25:17.080 --> 25:19.605
Everything's okay.
Can you open the door?

25:19.648 --> 25:21.737
Yeah, man.

25:26.263 --> 25:27.482
What's up, little man?

25:27.526 --> 25:29.571
Everything's okay.
Come here.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.138
Sit down, little homie.

25:31.921 --> 25:33.662
What's your name, bro?

25:33.706 --> 25:35.185
- Kevin.

25:35.229 --> 25:38.449
- Kevin.
That's my name too.

25:38.493 --> 25:40.451
That's a real good name, Kevin.

25:40.495 --> 25:41.801
Pound me on that.
Yeah, bro.

25:42.628 --> 25:44.151
Where's your dad?

25:44.194 --> 25:46.632
- I don't know.
I was sleeping.

26:01.647 --> 26:02.648
- Brad Snyder.

26:02.691 --> 26:05.346
- Yeah, my son.
Is my son okay?

26:05.389 --> 26:06.869
- Yeah, he's okay.
He's downstairs.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.392
What happened?

26:08.436 --> 26:10.264
- Ray Lambert happened.

26:11.004 --> 26:14.137
- Get up.
- Oh!

26:16.662 --> 26:18.228
- Sit your ass down.

26:18.272 --> 26:20.317
- Okay, okay.
- Sit down!

26:20.361 --> 26:22.929
Where's Ray Lambert?
- I don't know, sir.

26:22.972 --> 26:24.626
- He did this to you?
- Yeah.

26:24.670 --> 26:26.715
He--he called me,
said he wanted to come over.

26:26.759 --> 26:28.935
I'd just put my son down
for a nap; I invited him.

26:28.978 --> 26:30.371
- Look at me.

26:30.414 --> 26:31.633
Was he with anyone?

26:31.677 --> 26:33.940
- No.
- You know this kid?

26:33.983 --> 26:36.290
- Yes, that's, uh,
Ray's nephew.

26:36.333 --> 26:38.161
I--I met him a year ago.

26:38.205 --> 26:39.685
- You sure about that?
- Yeah.

26:39.728 --> 26:40.903
- It's not his nephew.

26:40.947 --> 26:42.078
That's the child he fathered

26:42.122 --> 26:43.514
from a woman he abducted
seven years ago.

26:43.558 --> 26:44.777
We know you've been
to his house.

26:44.820 --> 26:45.995
There isn't a chance in hell

26:46.039 --> 26:47.475
you didn't know what
we was doing in there.

26:47.518 --> 26:49.433
- I don't know
what you're talking about.

26:49.477 --> 26:51.784
I swear!
- This kid's life is in danger.

26:51.827 --> 26:53.829
- If you don't start talking,
Brad,

26:53.873 --> 26:55.962
we're gonna charge you
with accessory.

26:56.005 --> 26:58.529
- All I know is he came over
and he asked for money.

26:58.573 --> 26:59.661
I refused.

26:59.705 --> 27:01.532
Next thing I know,
he pulls out his Glock

27:01.576 --> 27:03.578
and he beats me with it.
He took my ATM card.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.928
He made me gave him
the pin number.

27:05.972 --> 27:09.062
He said he was gonna kill
my son if I went to the police.

27:12.021 --> 27:13.762
- What was he driving?

27:13.806 --> 27:15.285
- A--a black truck.

27:15.329 --> 27:18.462
A--a--a Honda, I think.

27:18.506 --> 27:20.203
It was like he was possessed.

27:20.247 --> 27:23.206
- Call it in.

27:23.250 --> 27:24.643
- 5021 Henry...

27:24.686 --> 27:26.688
- She'll be all right.
- Okay, thank you, Doctor.

27:26.732 --> 27:28.777
- Yeah.

27:30.692 --> 27:32.694
- Hi.

27:32.738 --> 27:34.217
How are you feeling?

27:34.261 --> 27:36.742
- I don't know.
I just wanna find my son.

27:36.785 --> 27:39.483
- I know.
We're still looking for him.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.485
You don't have any idea
where they might've gone?

27:41.529 --> 27:43.966
- No, but you need
to find him soon.

27:44.010 --> 27:46.490
Henry needs insulin.

27:46.534 --> 27:48.231
- Henry's diabetic?
- Yeah.

27:48.275 --> 27:50.843
And he needs an injection twice
a day or he goes into shock,

27:50.886 --> 27:52.888
and Ray didn't take
his insulin and--

27:52.932 --> 27:54.673
- Okay, that's very helpful.

27:55.586 --> 27:57.937
- What's gonna happen to Ray?

27:59.286 --> 28:00.722
I mean, he's not gonna
get Henry, right?

28:00.766 --> 28:01.984
Henry stays with me.

28:02.028 --> 28:04.508
- Ray is going to prison
for a very long time.

28:05.858 --> 28:07.729
Okay?

28:09.035 --> 28:10.558
- Would you?
- Yeah.

28:17.391 --> 28:20.220
I have to ask you
what happened to Ally.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.875
- Ray killed her.

28:22.918 --> 28:24.703
- Why?

28:24.746 --> 28:27.357
- Because she
was hurting Henry.

28:27.401 --> 28:29.664
She just hated Ray so much.

28:31.361 --> 28:34.669
- And Ray defended Henry
because Henry is Ray's son.

28:37.237 --> 28:39.369
Yeah.

28:39.413 --> 28:41.545
- Ray loves Henry.

28:41.589 --> 28:43.852
He wants to keep him.

28:43.896 --> 28:46.376
He'd say he'd kill him
before he let him go.

28:46.420 --> 28:48.378
- Well, we're not gonna
let that happen.

28:48.422 --> 28:51.207
We're gonna bring him back
to you safe, okay?

28:51.251 --> 28:53.383
You don't have to worry.

28:53.427 --> 28:56.169
- You don't have kids, do you?

28:56.212 --> 28:57.910
- No, I don't.

28:57.953 --> 29:00.521
- When you do, you'll know.

29:02.741 --> 29:05.352
There's no such thing
as not worrying.

29:13.360 --> 29:15.231
- Sarge?
- What do you got?

29:15.275 --> 29:16.972
- Followed up on what Burgess
got from Claire,

29:17.016 --> 29:18.452
but no luck with
any of the pharmacies.

29:18.495 --> 29:20.976
No incidents reported,
no Ray Lambert in any system.

29:21.020 --> 29:22.804
- But we have confirmation
of Brad's story.

29:22.848 --> 29:24.719
All right,
this was taken three hours ago

29:24.763 --> 29:26.155
at an ATM on Belmont.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.809
This is Ray Lambert
withdrawing 500 bucks

29:27.853 --> 29:28.984
from Brad Snyder's account,

29:29.028 --> 29:30.507
and that's the car
that Brad described.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.553
We can't see inside, so we
don't know if Henry's in there.

29:32.596 --> 29:33.989
- Plates came back as stolen.

29:34.033 --> 29:35.425
Got an AMBER alert
across the state,

29:35.469 --> 29:37.471
All Call messages being
broadcasted on all the zones,

29:37.514 --> 29:38.559
and it's burned.

29:38.602 --> 29:39.516
We got a lot of eyes on this.

29:39.560 --> 29:40.648
Anyone who spots it

29:40.691 --> 29:42.171
will contact Intelligence
immediately.

29:42.215 --> 29:43.912
- All right, Adam,
pick up Kim at Med,

29:43.956 --> 29:45.348
head over to that Belmont ATM.

29:45.392 --> 29:48.308
See if any witnesses saw Henry
or heard anything.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.397
- You got it.

29:57.447 --> 29:58.666
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.189
How's Claire holding up?

30:00.233 --> 30:01.321
- She's tough.

30:01.364 --> 30:02.801
Doctors practically had
to restrain her

30:02.844 --> 30:04.628
to keep her from looking
for Henry.

30:04.672 --> 30:05.847
- How about you?
You doing all right?

30:05.891 --> 30:07.109
You okay?

30:07.153 --> 30:10.199
- I'm good, man,
but I wanna catch this animal.

30:10.243 --> 30:12.071
- That's not really
what I was talking about.

30:16.118 --> 30:18.077
- I made an appointment
for tomorrow morning.

30:20.340 --> 30:21.602
- Okay.

30:21.645 --> 30:24.344
All right, um...

30:24.387 --> 30:26.433
Well--
- 5021 Ida, you on the air?

30:27.869 --> 30:29.871
- Yeah, go for 5021 Ida.

30:29.915 --> 30:32.831
- 935 Charlie has located
your targeted BOLO vehicle.

30:32.874 --> 30:33.875
It just pulled into
Cook Brothers

30:33.919 --> 30:35.398
on Belmont and Broadway.

30:35.442 --> 30:37.357
They're sitting down the
street, but have eyes on it.

30:37.400 --> 30:38.880
- All right,
we're five minutes out.

30:38.924 --> 30:39.968
- We just got word on the zone.

30:40.012 --> 30:42.579
Patrol has spotted our Honda.

30:55.810 --> 30:58.769
- It doesn't look occupied.

30:58.813 --> 31:00.510
- Sarge, we got eyes
on Ray's vehicle

31:00.554 --> 31:02.034
on the Cook Brothers lot.

31:02.077 --> 31:03.949
No sign of him or Henry.
I think maybe they're inside.

31:03.992 --> 31:05.907
- Okay,
confirm the vehicle's empty.

31:05.951 --> 31:07.866
I'm pulling into
the parking lot now.

31:07.909 --> 31:09.780
- Copy you.
- Careful.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.273
The vehicle's empty.

31:24.317 --> 31:25.971
- All right, head inside,
get eyes on him.

31:26.014 --> 31:26.972
Be careful.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.887
- Copy you.

31:37.852 --> 31:39.636
I'm still looking.
I don't have eyes.

31:55.043 --> 31:56.653
Sorry.

31:56.697 --> 31:58.829
- That's all right.

32:01.267 --> 32:02.833
- We've got the scumbag.

32:02.877 --> 32:04.966
He just bought a toy train,
which means Henry's alive.

32:05.010 --> 32:07.186
- All right,
so let's follow him.

32:07.229 --> 32:08.970
Hopefully he'll lead us
to the kid.

32:10.580 --> 32:11.668
- Copy.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.759
- All right, Adam,
you and Kim take the point.

32:15.803 --> 32:18.937
I'll contact Hailey and Jay.
They'll stay wide with me.

32:18.980 --> 32:20.895
- Copy that.

32:21.591 --> 32:23.550
- Hold on a second.
What is this?

32:23.593 --> 32:25.030
Hold it.
Hold it.

32:25.073 --> 32:27.293
Hey, hey!
Get rid of this guy.

32:28.381 --> 32:30.731
- Officer, officer!
Hey!

32:30.774 --> 32:31.993
Kill your lights.

32:32.037 --> 32:33.386
Ruzek, Intelligence.
What's going on?

32:33.429 --> 32:35.040
- This car is hot,
and there's a BOLO out on it.

32:35.083 --> 32:36.606
- Yeah,
we're aware it's stolen.

32:36.650 --> 32:39.218
We got it under control, okay?
We need you guys to move on.

32:40.523 --> 32:42.264
- Okay, Lambert's heading out
the front door.

32:42.308 --> 32:43.483
I'm going out the east door.

32:43.526 --> 32:45.137
I can't risk him
spotting me again.

32:45.180 --> 32:47.008
- No, we got this undercover
right now.

32:47.052 --> 32:48.836
We need you to move on
down the road.

32:48.879 --> 32:50.142
Get down!

32:53.406 --> 32:54.885
- Kim, he's heading back
in the store!

32:54.929 --> 32:56.322
- Everybody, down!
Everybody, down!

32:56.365 --> 32:57.192
Chicago PD!

32:57.236 --> 32:58.237
Get down!
Get down, move!

32:58.280 --> 32:59.455
Come on!
Move, move, move!

32:59.499 --> 33:01.762
- 5021 Adam,
shots fired at the police.

33:01.805 --> 33:03.024
Belmont and Broadway.

33:05.418 --> 33:06.767
- Lambert's fleeing towards
the rear!

33:14.514 --> 33:16.342
- Talk to me, people.
Did you see him?

33:16.385 --> 33:17.821
If you're too scared to talk,
just point.

33:17.865 --> 33:20.041
- Ladies and gentlemen,
my name is Officer Ruzek.

33:20.085 --> 33:21.477
I need you to stay calm,
stay low,

33:21.521 --> 33:23.044
and get the hell out
of the store right now.

33:23.088 --> 33:25.525
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Move!

33:26.874 --> 33:28.963
Officer, go left.
Go left.

33:30.182 --> 33:31.357
- Adam, watch yourself.

33:31.400 --> 33:33.402
- Ladies, please,
out of the store.

33:33.446 --> 33:34.447
Move, now.

33:34.490 --> 33:35.926
Out of the store.
Out of the store.

33:38.799 --> 33:40.583
- I got him!

33:45.849 --> 33:48.200
- Hey, hey!
He's in there!

33:48.243 --> 33:51.246
He's in there!
- He's in the store!

33:53.292 --> 33:55.163
- Try to relax...
- Hey!

33:55.207 --> 33:57.513
Drop your weapon!

33:57.557 --> 33:58.732
Ray!

33:58.775 --> 33:59.950
Listen to me.

33:59.994 --> 34:01.474
Ray, drop the gun.

34:01.517 --> 34:03.954
- Drop your gun now!
- Officer, stand down.

34:03.998 --> 34:05.608
Listen to my voice, Ray.

34:05.652 --> 34:06.870
Just turn around, okay?

34:06.914 --> 34:08.089
Ray, come on.

34:08.133 --> 34:09.612
Turn around,
drop that weapon, all right?

34:09.656 --> 34:11.527
- Hands in the air...
- Officer, I gave you an order!

34:11.571 --> 34:12.615
Stand down!

34:12.659 --> 34:14.095
Ray, listen to me.
This is about Henry.

34:14.139 --> 34:15.879
This isn't about you or me.
Think about Henry.

34:15.923 --> 34:17.664
Just turn around slow.
Drop that weapon.

34:21.102 --> 34:23.844
- Sir,
put your weapon down now.

34:23.887 --> 34:26.107
- No, no, no, no, no!

34:26.151 --> 34:28.979
- Ray, where is he?

34:29.023 --> 34:30.198
Where's Henry?

34:30.242 --> 34:31.591
Where is he?
Tell me where he is, okay?

34:31.634 --> 34:33.071
Don't let him die.
Don't let Henry die.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.115
Tell me where he is.

34:34.159 --> 34:35.725
You've got to tell me
where Henry is.

34:35.769 --> 34:36.944
Please don't let him die!

34:36.987 --> 34:38.641
Where is Henry?
Tell me where Henry is!

34:38.685 --> 34:40.121
Come on!

34:41.818 --> 34:43.472
- Kim...

34:55.963 --> 34:57.660
- Okay, we got anything useful?

34:57.704 --> 34:58.705
- There's nothing
in the wallet

34:58.748 --> 34:59.967
and the phone
is password protected,

35:00.010 --> 35:01.708
so it's gonna take
the techs time to crack it.

35:01.751 --> 35:03.101
- Found an insulin pen
in his pocket

35:03.144 --> 35:04.363
from the pharmacy inside.

35:04.406 --> 35:05.886
Sarge, Henry hasn't
had insulin in hours.

35:05.929 --> 35:07.888
If we don't find that kid soon,
he's going into shock.

35:07.931 --> 35:09.411
- All right, let's get
some extra pens on hand

35:09.455 --> 35:10.978
just to be safe.

35:11.021 --> 35:12.414
- Sarge, you got your ears on?

35:12.458 --> 35:13.720
- Yeah, I'm here.
Go ahead, Hailey.

35:13.763 --> 35:15.765
- Just went through Ray's car.

35:15.809 --> 35:19.073
There's propane tanks,
canned goods, and a lantern.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.814
- 10-4.

35:20.857 --> 35:23.208
Camping gear.
It makes sense.

35:23.251 --> 35:25.384
You lay low for a few weeks
until the heat dies off,

35:25.427 --> 35:26.776
then head out of town.

35:26.820 --> 35:28.343
- Not a lot of traffic around
camping sites

35:28.387 --> 35:29.779
this time of year.

35:29.823 --> 35:31.564
He could've stashed the kid
there this morning,

35:31.607 --> 35:33.348
planned to go back later.

35:33.392 --> 35:37.135
- Platt said patrol found his
blue Nissan out on Route 57.

35:38.353 --> 35:41.226
- Okay, we know that Ray
left his house this morning

35:41.269 --> 35:42.618
in that SUV.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.098
By the time he gets
to Brad Snyder's place

35:44.142 --> 35:46.579
an hour later, he has a new car
and he has no kid.

35:46.622 --> 35:47.928
- He couldn't have
ditched them both

35:47.971 --> 35:50.670
unless he ditched them
in the same place.

35:50.713 --> 35:52.498
- All right, get patrol,
get some bodies.

35:52.541 --> 35:54.326
Let's start looking
at camp sites in the area.

35:54.369 --> 35:55.979
Let's move.

36:05.511 --> 36:08.992
- Henry!

36:11.821 --> 36:14.259
- No, I haven't.
- No.

36:14.302 --> 36:16.696
- Anything?
- Henry!

36:16.739 --> 36:19.438
Henry, Henry, where are you?
- Sorry.

36:19.481 --> 36:21.788
- I got nothing over here.

36:21.831 --> 36:24.138
Henry!
- Hey, Adam, no luck.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.922
- Thanks for the update.

36:25.966 --> 36:28.055
All right, that was Hailey.

36:28.098 --> 36:29.622
We checked five camp grounds
so far.

36:29.665 --> 36:30.884
No sign of Henry.

36:30.927 --> 36:32.494
- So maybe we got the winner.
Hey.

36:32.538 --> 36:34.192
You the manager?
- Yeah.

36:34.235 --> 36:36.629
- Thanks for meeting with us.
- Whatever I can do to help.

36:36.672 --> 36:38.196
- You recognize this guy?

36:39.762 --> 36:41.416
- Yeah, I saw him earlier.

36:41.460 --> 36:43.679
He was lugging a travel
trailer, real piece of crap.

36:43.723 --> 36:44.898
Quiet guy.
Paid in cash.

36:44.941 --> 36:46.943
- Great, great.
Where is the camper parked?

36:48.684 --> 36:51.992
- Site 49, near the pond.
- Thank you.

36:54.081 --> 36:56.126
- Henry!

36:56.170 --> 36:58.738
It's locked!
Adam, it's locked!

36:58.781 --> 37:01.175
Henry, can you hear me?
Can you come to the window?

37:01.219 --> 37:03.177
Henry, can you hear us?
Can you open it from inside?

37:03.221 --> 37:04.570
Henry!

37:04.613 --> 37:05.875
- All right,
let me get the pry bar.

37:05.919 --> 37:08.704
- Yeah.

37:14.014 --> 37:15.363
Come on!

37:17.670 --> 37:19.019
Call an ambo!

37:19.062 --> 37:21.500
Henry, listen to me.
I'm a police officer, okay?

37:21.543 --> 37:22.675
I'm going to help you.

37:22.718 --> 37:23.763
Henry, can you hear my voice?

37:23.806 --> 37:25.199
I need you to stay with me,
all right?

37:25.243 --> 37:26.331
I'm here to help you.

37:26.374 --> 37:28.202
I'm gonna give you
some medicine, buddy.

37:29.725 --> 37:31.423
Stay with me, please.
Please, please, Henry.

37:31.466 --> 37:33.686
Henry, please!
Stay with me!

37:33.729 --> 37:34.817
Talk to me, Henry.
Talk to me.

37:34.861 --> 37:36.819
- Mommy.
I want my mommy.

37:36.863 --> 37:38.038
- Oh, good.
Okay.

37:38.081 --> 37:39.518
We're gonna find your mommy,
all right?

37:39.561 --> 37:40.693
Just hold out.

37:40.736 --> 37:42.129
- He's stabilizing.

37:42.172 --> 37:45.437
- Let's go.
Come on, come on, come on.

37:45.480 --> 37:48.222
Hold on.
Hang on, buddy, hang on.

37:52.966 --> 37:55.708
- Where is she?
- She'll be here soon, buddy.

37:55.751 --> 37:57.100
I promise.

37:57.144 --> 37:58.537
- Henry?

38:00.365 --> 38:02.715
Hi!

38:02.758 --> 38:05.370
Hi, buddy!
I missed you!

38:05.413 --> 38:07.023
- I was in the forest.

38:07.067 --> 38:09.112
- You were?

38:09.156 --> 38:10.418
Thank you.

38:10.462 --> 38:12.159
Thank you for finding him.

38:12.202 --> 38:14.814
- Yeah.
I'm glad he's okay.

38:21.168 --> 38:23.388
Claire...

38:23.431 --> 38:25.520
Um...

38:25.564 --> 38:27.130
good luck.

38:31.439 --> 38:33.485
- Thank you.

38:33.528 --> 38:34.747
- Yeah.

38:34.790 --> 38:37.140
- I'll be okay.

38:37.184 --> 38:38.533
I have Henry.

38:41.710 --> 38:43.582
He's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

38:46.498 --> 38:48.282
That must sound crazy, right?

38:48.326 --> 38:49.631
- No, no.
It's--

38:49.675 --> 38:52.808
- I didn't want to be there,
obviously.

38:55.028 --> 38:57.987
I hate him for what he did.

38:59.859 --> 39:02.165
I'm glad he's dead.

39:05.168 --> 39:08.215
But...

39:08.258 --> 39:11.827
I wouldn't trade Henry
for the world.

39:31.630 --> 39:33.980
- Kim, you in here?
- Yeah.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.335
- Oh, that was a tough day,
you know?

39:42.380 --> 39:45.339
- Yeah, it's a bit
of a tough day.

39:46.079 --> 39:47.950
- I don't want you to be alone
in all of this.

39:47.994 --> 39:49.909
I think you should let me drive
you to the appointment.

39:49.952 --> 39:51.519
- Yeah, that's not necessary.

39:51.563 --> 39:53.956
- I know that you're a strong
independent woman and all that,

39:54.000 --> 39:56.481
but I care about you,
and I want to be there for you.

39:56.524 --> 39:58.396
- Having this baby
would be so hard, Adam.

39:58.439 --> 40:00.441
- I'm not trying
to influence you either way.

40:00.485 --> 40:02.356
- Yeah, let me finish then.

40:05.011 --> 40:07.230
Maybe it's selfish of me,

40:07.274 --> 40:09.537
with this job

40:09.581 --> 40:12.497
and being single,

40:12.540 --> 40:15.195
but...

40:15.238 --> 40:19.329
I don't want to miss
the opportunity to be a mom.

40:19.373 --> 40:23.464
And I don't want to make
a decision I might regret.

40:26.641 --> 40:27.860
- Okay, what does that mean?

40:31.777 --> 40:34.040
- I don't know what it means...

40:35.345 --> 40:37.260
Other than I...

40:37.304 --> 40:39.393
I cancelled
the appointment.

40:41.569 --> 40:43.658
- Okay.
All right.

40:53.929 --> 40:55.540
It'll be okay.
