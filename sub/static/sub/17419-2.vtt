00:13.693 --> 00:15.160
Oh, my God.

00:23.383 --> 00:26.624
God, I cannot believe
you got a girl's number on the train!

00:26.658 --> 00:28.324
Well, I didn't... you know, I...
It wasn't a pick-up,

00:28.376 --> 00:29.626
I just got her business card.

00:29.661 --> 00:31.461
Oh, my God, read it to me.

00:31.496 --> 00:33.630
"Laura Ferber, Marketing Liaison."

00:33.665 --> 00:35.415
God, I knew she was black!

00:35.500 --> 00:36.966
No, it... she's not black.

00:37.002 --> 00:38.551
Oh... well, whatever.

00:38.637 --> 00:40.136
Either way, I'm proud of you, buddy.

00:40.171 --> 00:41.337
The coolest part is that

00:41.389 --> 00:43.256
she seems so nice.

00:43.341 --> 00:44.257
Awesome.

00:44.342 --> 00:46.059
Like, I looked at her eyes

00:46.144 --> 00:48.144
- and I was like, these are nice, like...
- Yeah.

00:48.179 --> 00:51.147
- You know, sometimes...
- You want to jizz all in 'em or something.

00:51.182 --> 00:52.482
No, no.

00:52.517 --> 00:53.683
There's nothing semen about this.

00:53.735 --> 00:55.068
- Oh, okay.
- I feel like,

00:55.153 --> 00:56.486
for the first time since we broke up,

00:56.521 --> 00:58.521
I'm actually over Maggie.

00:58.606 --> 01:00.440
Maggie...

01:00.525 --> 01:02.075
You hear that?

01:02.160 --> 01:03.576
Maggie...

01:03.662 --> 01:06.029
Nah. It sounds like your walls
are whispering, "Maggie."

01:06.114 --> 01:08.698
That's-that's, uh, the old pipes.

01:08.783 --> 01:10.867
- The-the old pipes.
- Ah. Uh-huh. Okay, all right.

01:10.919 --> 01:13.536
Anyway, you were, uh, saying?
About being totally over Maggie?

01:13.588 --> 01:15.204
Wait, who's Maggie? That kind of thing.

01:15.256 --> 01:17.090
Like, it's just like it's off my shoulders.

01:17.175 --> 01:18.875
And right now, Josh is in a good place.

01:18.960 --> 01:21.044
Hey, is that a framed photo

01:21.129 --> 01:23.713
of you and Maggie spookily coming to life?

01:23.798 --> 01:25.548
That's a floating, uh, framed photo of

01:25.600 --> 01:27.383
two-two... Come here...

01:27.435 --> 01:29.719
two other...
two other people that were in love.

01:29.771 --> 01:31.220
What about that pink razor

01:31.306 --> 01:32.555
crawling across the rug?

01:32.640 --> 01:33.639
That Maggie-related?

01:33.725 --> 01:35.641
No. No, that's...

01:35.727 --> 01:37.143
You okay, man?

01:37.228 --> 01:38.361
You're not dealing with Maggie, or...

01:39.564 --> 01:41.981
- Nope. Not at all.
- Okay, Josh,

01:42.067 --> 01:43.816
if you're really over Maggie,
why do you still have her stuff?

01:43.902 --> 01:45.034
I don't... what stuff?

01:45.070 --> 01:47.203
Just a cute framed picture

01:47.238 --> 01:48.571
and a little pink razor blade?

01:48.656 --> 01:50.406
I don't have anything else.

Father, thank God you're here.

02:33.334 --> 02:35.118
- DoveÂ¨?
- Follow me.

02:38.423 --> 02:40.089
<i>Dio mio.</i>

02:40.125 --> 02:42.291
Mike, you really didn't have
to hire an exorcist, man.

02:42.343 --> 02:43.868
Everything's fine.

02:44.128 --> 02:45.531
Aah!

02:47.298 --> 02:49.632
Maybelline.

02:49.717 --> 02:51.050
Maybe she's born with it.

02:51.136 --> 02:52.468
Ugh.

02:52.554 --> 02:54.270
What?

02:54.305 --> 02:55.471
What's he saying?

02:55.557 --> 02:57.723
Uh, he says you're being haunted
by your ex-girlfriend.

02:57.743 --> 02:59.776
Haunted? Maggie's still alive.

03:01.446 --> 03:03.279
That doesn't matter.

03:03.314 --> 03:06.816
She will continue to haunt you
as long as you still still love her.

03:06.901 --> 03:08.920
I don't still love her.
I am totally over her.

03:08.940 --> 03:09.952
Aah!

03:11.823 --> 03:13.835
Yeah, then why do you still have her stuff?

03:16.161 --> 03:17.627
What's that about? Seems weird.

03:17.662 --> 03:18.961
Or, like, um...

03:18.997 --> 03:20.329
What, "pathetic"?

03:20.381 --> 03:22.748
- Aah!
- Or "desperate..."

03:22.834 --> 03:24.133
Uh, "unable to move on..."

03:24.169 --> 03:25.334
Something... yeah, something like that.

03:25.386 --> 03:26.919
Just lame. Just lame.

03:27.005 --> 03:28.638
Everything here is under control.

03:37.682 --> 03:39.015
Whoa! No, no, no!

03:41.519 --> 03:43.236
Oh, that was my favorite one. Aah!

03:43.321 --> 03:45.321
I picked it out of the catalog.

03:45.356 --> 03:46.689
It was so cool.

03:48.276 --> 03:49.492
You must get rid of all of

03:49.527 --> 03:51.444
Maggie's stuff,
or else you will never move on.

03:51.529 --> 03:52.695
Hey, come on...

03:55.366 --> 03:56.866
Okay. Okay, okay. I'm in.

03:56.951 --> 03:58.034
Good idea.

03:59.871 --> 04:01.120
That was the last of it.

04:13.017 --> 04:16.552
Guess, uh... guess that's that.

04:16.637 --> 04:18.187
Uh, father, thank you.

04:18.223 --> 04:20.389
<i>Grazie...</i> Or, um...

04:20.475 --> 04:22.578
- Do... do I... Do I tip him?
- Nah.

04:22.598 --> 04:23.559
- Nah?
- Nah.

04:23.611 --> 04:24.810
Are we paying him at all?

04:24.896 --> 04:26.229
- Nah.
- No.

04:26.281 --> 04:27.697
We'll just go to church or something.

04:27.732 --> 04:28.865
I... I'm Jewish.

04:31.986 --> 04:33.286
I thought you said that was everything.

04:33.371 --> 04:34.704
It's, uh, almost everything.

04:36.241 --> 04:38.241
What is that thing?

04:38.293 --> 04:40.576
Maggie won it for me at a, uh, fair.

04:40.628 --> 04:41.878
We called it Mr. heart,
'cause he's a little heart.

04:41.913 --> 04:43.629
- Oh, my God.
- Mama Mia!

04:43.715 --> 04:44.797
- Ha! Ha!
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

04:44.883 --> 04:46.415
Please, please, please, please.

04:46.467 --> 04:48.134
Just let me keep this one thing.

04:48.219 --> 04:49.252
He's cute, he's fuzzy.

04:49.337 --> 04:50.636
Look, he speaks!

04:50.722 --> 04:51.837
I love you.

04:54.726 --> 04:56.058
Gotta destroy it. Now.

04:56.094 --> 04:57.927
But it seems a tad wasteful.

04:58.012 --> 04:59.262
I mean, C-Craigslist.

04:59.347 --> 05:00.763
Craigslist?

05:00.815 --> 05:02.598
It's a piece of garbage.
Nobody wants it, Josh!

05:02.684 --> 05:04.100
Actually, you know who might want it?

05:04.185 --> 05:05.434
Maggie might want it. Let me just call her.

05:05.486 --> 05:06.435
No! No, no, no! Just get rid of it, man!

05:06.487 --> 05:07.767
- Get rid of it!
- No.

05:08.773 --> 05:10.670
Good-bye, Mr. heart.

05:11.242 --> 05:13.276
I love you.

05:13.328 --> 05:15.111
I love you.
And now you're going to...

05:15.196 --> 05:17.029
suck my dick!

05:17.115 --> 05:18.781
Suck it!

05:21.452 --> 05:23.452
Yeah, yeah! Oh, yeah!

05:23.504 --> 05:25.254
Suck him off, man! Finish him off!

05:25.290 --> 05:27.957
Somehow he has a penis now!

05:28.042 --> 05:29.292
Work the shaft, Josh.

05:29.377 --> 05:31.544
Come on. Now you get it. Oh, yeah.

05:35.016 --> 05:36.048
Get it off!

05:37.969 --> 05:39.802
Aah!

05:39.854 --> 05:41.387
Do it!

05:41.472 --> 05:42.805
Suck that dick...

05:48.363 --> 05:50.313
Oh, God. Mr. heart...

05:50.365 --> 05:52.148
Oh, that stinks.

05:52.233 --> 05:53.399
I'm just happy it's over.

05:53.484 --> 05:54.483
No! Huh?

05:55.870 --> 05:57.820
He says there is

05:57.905 --> 05:59.739
a final task you must complete
before you're free of Maggie.

05:59.824 --> 06:01.324
Do I have to pray? Or is penance...

06:01.409 --> 06:04.377
Whatever... You must sex... new woman.

06:04.462 --> 06:06.879
Okay, well,
I just got a number from Laura...

06:06.965 --> 06:08.331
Number?

06:08.416 --> 06:10.333
You must do sex.

06:10.385 --> 06:12.001
Huh? <i>Capisce?</i>

06:12.053 --> 06:13.002
- Yes.
- Understand?

06:13.087 --> 06:14.670
I-I will... I will have...

06:14.722 --> 06:15.638
He doesn't understand.

06:15.673 --> 06:17.340
Balls deep, eh?

06:17.425 --> 06:18.724
Oh, my God...

06:18.810 --> 06:20.559
"P"... Yeah?

06:20.645 --> 06:21.811
- in "V." Huh?
- Oh...

06:21.846 --> 06:22.895
Okay.

06:22.981 --> 06:24.180
- Empty balls.
- Oh, my God.

06:24.232 --> 06:26.015
- Sex! Sex!
- Yeah, okay.

06:26.067 --> 06:27.183
Mmm. That's... I will try.

06:27.268 --> 06:28.517
- Try what? Huh?
- Oh, my God.

06:28.603 --> 06:29.685
- Huh?
- I... I will try to...

06:29.771 --> 06:31.020
- Say what is you try!
- Oh, my God!

06:31.105 --> 06:32.355
Say what is you try!

06:32.440 --> 06:33.689
- I will try to...
- Huh?

06:33.775 --> 06:35.524
- Empty my balls.
- Yes?

06:35.576 --> 06:37.026
- Fire my "P"...
- Yes?

06:37.111 --> 06:38.611
into... into a "V."

06:38.696 --> 06:39.945
Ah!

06:40.031 --> 06:40.863
Okay, okay.

06:40.948 --> 06:41.914
Amen.

06:43.034 --> 06:44.250
A-amen.

06:44.335 --> 06:46.173
Hey, you're having sex.

06:47.218 --> 06:49.351
Okay, I think I got it.
Can I read it to you? Uh-huh.

06:49.436 --> 06:52.214
"Hi, Laura, it's Josh from the train.

06:52.234 --> 06:53.537
"Great meeting you.

06:53.557 --> 06:55.440
Want to get dinner Friday?"

06:55.475 --> 06:57.843
- Oh, that sucks.
- What's wrong with it?

06:57.863 --> 06:59.811
"Great meeting you.
I'm Josh from the train.

06:59.863 --> 07:01.029
You want to get dinner Friday?"

07:01.114 --> 07:02.314
Okay, I know what I sound like.

07:02.366 --> 07:03.982
So what... what should I write, then?

07:04.034 --> 07:05.650
Uh, "come over.

07:05.736 --> 07:07.319
Come and get this." Something like that.

07:07.404 --> 07:09.237
I can't say that.
That seems a bit aggressive.

07:09.323 --> 07:10.872
It's not aggressive enough, man.

07:10.957 --> 07:12.374
How 'bout this, dude?

07:12.459 --> 07:14.409
Send her a picture of your penis.

07:14.494 --> 07:16.745
Ooh, shh. Yeah. Caption...

07:16.830 --> 07:17.962
"Guess who."

07:19.549 --> 07:20.832
I can't...

07:20.884 --> 07:22.467
I-I think I need another opinion.

07:22.502 --> 07:24.552
Josh, are you okay?

07:24.638 --> 07:26.838
I want to text Laura,
but I-I don't know what to say.

07:26.923 --> 07:28.723
- You said it was an emergency.
- Well, it is.

07:28.809 --> 07:30.425
I really like this girl,
I don't want to blow it.

07:30.510 --> 07:32.177
- Oh, my God.
- Wait, wait! Listen, listen to this.

07:32.262 --> 07:35.013
Uh, uh, "Hi, Laura,
it's Josh from the train.

07:35.065 --> 07:36.348
Great meeting you. Come get this."

07:36.433 --> 07:38.337
That's pretty good, right?

07:40.153 --> 07:41.353
Cancel my 2:00.

07:41.405 --> 07:42.654
I have a family emergency.

07:42.689 --> 07:43.970
I got it.

07:43.990 --> 07:45.607
- Okay.
- "Laura."

07:45.692 --> 07:47.525
- Period.
- Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

07:47.611 --> 07:50.195
"It's your stranger from the train.

07:50.247 --> 07:51.746
- Film reference.
- Nice.

07:51.832 --> 07:53.748
"Would you do me the honor

07:53.834 --> 07:57.252
of joining me for dinner
this Friday's eve?"

07:57.337 --> 07:59.254
I like it. That's pretty good, yeah.

07:59.339 --> 08:01.039
- "This Friday's Eve"?
- Yeah.

08:01.091 --> 08:03.091
It's clever, it's quirky...

08:03.176 --> 08:04.542
- That sucks.
- I've been in

08:04.628 --> 08:06.378
a long-distance relationship
for three years.

08:06.463 --> 08:07.379
That's why you don't know anything.

08:07.464 --> 08:08.880
I have sex with women.

08:08.932 --> 08:09.964
- I know how to talk to women.
- Do you?

08:10.050 --> 08:11.466
Or do you just say, "uh, uh,

08:11.551 --> 08:13.218
put your butt on my face."

08:13.270 --> 08:15.270
Yeah, I say, "put my butt on your face."

08:15.355 --> 08:16.354
Type that, 'cause that's better than
"this Friday's eve."

08:16.390 --> 08:17.772
Thank you. Um...

08:17.858 --> 08:19.957
I think I need another opinion.

08:22.396 --> 08:24.229
To me, the course of action is clear.

08:24.314 --> 08:26.281
The text, above all, ought to be cute.

08:26.366 --> 08:27.899
I would deploy

08:27.951 --> 08:28.950
an emoji.

08:29.035 --> 08:30.318
Perhaps a crying

08:30.404 --> 08:32.736
wah-wah face or a winky kitten.

08:32.789 --> 08:35.323
I... I...
a well-placed kitten, actually, could...

08:35.409 --> 08:37.125
Sir? If I may...

08:37.210 --> 08:38.076
Our research indicates

08:38.128 --> 08:39.327
that women enjoy texts

08:39.413 --> 08:41.246
in which you reference something

08:41.298 --> 08:42.163
that you talked about before.

08:42.249 --> 08:43.998
We... we have no idea why.

08:44.083 --> 08:45.750
Okay, well,
let's-let's run with that, then.

08:45.802 --> 08:47.919
What are... what are some things
I said to Laura on the train?

08:47.971 --> 08:49.721
Okay...
You talked about the weather...

08:49.756 --> 08:51.903
The fact that it was a weekend...

08:53.107 --> 08:54.175
Um...

08:54.261 --> 08:56.680
The fact that you were on a train...

08:58.598 --> 08:59.347
Wait.

08:59.433 --> 09:00.849
I've got it.

09:00.934 --> 09:02.267
"Choo-choo!

09:02.319 --> 09:04.519
"It's Josh from the train.

09:04.604 --> 09:06.654
Next stop, dinner!"

09:06.740 --> 09:08.523
Right?

09:08.608 --> 09:09.991
That's really cute.

09:10.076 --> 09:11.609
It's really good.

09:11.695 --> 09:13.411
- It's good.
- Yes.

09:13.447 --> 09:14.362
It's one... Yeah, okay, it's just...

09:14.448 --> 09:15.663
We have a lot of ideas.

09:15.749 --> 09:17.782
That's a classy problem to have.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.083
Tell you what. I'm gonna start it off.

09:20.954 --> 09:22.954
"Hey, it's Josh."

09:23.039 --> 09:24.255
See? Already, you've failed.

09:24.291 --> 09:26.207
You've got a comma after your "hey"

09:26.293 --> 09:27.959
and a period after "Josh."

09:28.044 --> 09:30.545
What's next, semicolons and footnotes?

09:30.630 --> 09:32.430
Okay, fine, no... No punctuation.

09:32.466 --> 09:34.632
No, I... If you look at the data,

09:34.684 --> 09:36.768
you will see that women are going nuts

09:36.803 --> 09:39.220
- for punctuation.
- That is true.

09:39.306 --> 09:40.722
Exclamation points, in particular.

09:40.807 --> 09:42.774
I would... I would suggest 50.

09:42.809 --> 09:45.226
Fifty?

09:45.312 --> 09:47.695
- So now we're screaming at her?
- Time is critical right now.

09:47.781 --> 09:49.397
- If you would just listen!
- We only have one chance to do this right.

09:49.483 --> 09:50.398
I'll just masturbate.

09:50.484 --> 09:51.866
I'll just masturbate.

09:51.952 --> 09:53.818
Look at us!

09:53.904 --> 09:56.120
Panicking like a bunch
of frightened children.

09:56.156 --> 09:59.491
What happened to us?

09:59.543 --> 10:01.826
What happened to America?

10:04.331 --> 10:06.915
There was a farmer from Virginia.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.751
He had a funny little idea

10:09.836 --> 10:11.336
about starting a country based on freedom.

10:11.421 --> 10:12.804
You might have heard of him.

10:12.839 --> 10:14.973
His name was George Washington.

10:15.008 --> 10:18.059
Josh...

10:18.144 --> 10:19.677
Send Laura a dick pic.

10:19.763 --> 10:22.397
I'm sorry, did you just say "dick pic"?

10:22.482 --> 10:24.599
Through the boxers, fully erect,

10:24.684 --> 10:27.485
with a quarter in the
frame to show its size.

10:27.521 --> 10:29.153
Look.

10:29.189 --> 10:30.688
We can send a normal text

10:30.740 --> 10:32.857
that's smart and funny

10:32.943 --> 10:35.193
and references a thing from before.

10:35.245 --> 10:37.362
And we could get that dinner on Friday.

10:37.414 --> 10:38.997
But where would that lead to?

10:39.032 --> 10:40.365
Another text?

10:40.450 --> 10:41.699
Another dinner?

10:41.785 --> 10:43.668
Text, dinner, text, dinner!

10:43.703 --> 10:46.704
The goal isn't texts and dinners!

10:46.756 --> 10:48.553
It's sex!

10:48.573 --> 10:50.621
We want sex!

10:50.641 --> 10:52.627
And if that's not something she wants,

10:52.712 --> 10:54.546
well, then, we need to know right now!

10:54.598 --> 10:55.713
Yeah!

10:55.765 --> 10:58.883
Perhaps it's fate
that today is the fourth of July.

10:58.969 --> 11:01.135
It's November 12.

11:01.221 --> 11:03.271
Today let's not be coy.

11:03.356 --> 11:07.225
Let's not be smart or funny or quirky.

11:07.277 --> 11:09.394
Let's pull down our pants,

11:09.446 --> 11:11.813
take out our dick,

11:11.898 --> 11:15.149
jerk off a little bit to make it hard,

11:15.235 --> 11:17.735
and send her a picture
of it with the caption...

11:17.787 --> 11:18.903
"guess who."

11:18.955 --> 11:19.904
Yes!

11:21.458 --> 11:23.157
Dick pic!

11:23.243 --> 11:25.577
Dick pic! Dick pic! Dick pic!

11:25.662 --> 11:27.412
Yeah, uh, I don't, I don't,
I don't really want

11:27.464 --> 11:28.880
to send her a picture of my dick.

11:28.915 --> 11:30.331
Yeah, it's a really bad idea.

11:30.417 --> 11:31.716
It's a terrible, terrible idea. All right.

11:31.751 --> 11:32.667
Oh, my God, thank God.

11:32.752 --> 11:35.253
Oh, it's just all wrong.

11:35.305 --> 11:36.554
Doesn't add up.

11:36.590 --> 11:38.256
Think, Josh, think.

11:41.553 --> 11:43.116
I got it.

11:44.397 --> 11:45.513
What's he doing?

11:45.599 --> 11:46.848
Josh, be careful.

11:52.188 --> 11:53.938
It's in all caps.

11:54.024 --> 11:57.609
"Hi, Laura, it's Josh from the train.

11:57.661 --> 11:59.777
"Great meeting you.

11:59.829 --> 12:01.412
Want to get dinner Friday?"

12:01.448 --> 12:04.115
No jokes. No references.

12:04.167 --> 12:06.250
Well, it's just a normal thing,
like someone would say.

12:06.286 --> 12:07.835
Will it work?

12:07.921 --> 12:10.121
There's only one way to find out.

12:12.626 --> 12:14.042
Here it goes.

12:14.127 --> 12:15.376
Oh, God.

12:15.462 --> 12:16.928
"Hi, Laura,

12:16.963 --> 12:19.764
it's Josh from the train."

12:22.185 --> 12:24.135
"Josh from the traib"?
What the hell's a traib?!

12:24.187 --> 12:25.770
She's gonna think we're crazy.

12:25.805 --> 12:27.605
Oh, my God. Okay, delete,
delete, delete, delete, delete.

12:27.641 --> 12:29.807
"It's Josh...

12:29.893 --> 12:32.360
from the train."

12:35.148 --> 12:36.447
"Great meeting you."

12:36.483 --> 12:38.316
- Uh...
- You got it.

12:38.368 --> 12:41.202
"Want to get dinner

12:41.287 --> 12:43.621
this Friday?"

12:43.657 --> 12:45.323
Here goes nothing.

12:47.327 --> 12:49.043
- May God forgive us.
- Sending.

12:49.129 --> 12:50.545
Oh, it's so slow.

12:50.630 --> 12:52.830
Come on. What service do you have?

12:52.916 --> 12:54.549
Send, damn you. Send, damn you.

12:54.634 --> 12:56.050
Come on!

12:56.136 --> 12:57.358
Oh. Come on!

12:58.672 --> 13:00.505
Okay, it went through.

13:00.590 --> 13:02.507
The text went through.

13:08.181 --> 13:11.399
It's been almost 15 seconds
since Josh texted Laura,

13:11.484 --> 13:13.518
and still no response.

13:13.603 --> 13:16.187
By this point,
Laura must have seen the text,

13:16.272 --> 13:18.489
even if she was in the
bathroom or something,

13:18.525 --> 13:20.491
and yet the silence continues.

13:20.527 --> 13:21.943
What does it all mean?

13:22.028 --> 13:23.945
Was the text too forward?

13:24.030 --> 13:25.329
Not forward enough?

13:25.365 --> 13:27.615
Did she hate the text?

13:27.701 --> 13:29.777
There's just no way to know.

13:39.175 --> 13:41.726
Maybe she doesn't want
to seem too overeager.

13:41.761 --> 13:42.894
Maybe she's in the shower.

13:42.929 --> 13:45.030
She's not in the goddamn shower.

13:45.050 --> 13:48.833
She hated the text...
she's never gonna respond.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.702
Hey, relax, my man.

13:50.754 --> 13:52.203
We have to save face.

13:52.289 --> 13:54.038
We have to pretend we were just kidding.

13:54.124 --> 13:55.790
Text "jk."

13:55.876 --> 13:57.625
Hey, get him out of here! Text "jk"!

13:57.711 --> 13:59.461
Get him out of here.

13:59.546 --> 14:00.712
Oh, my God.

14:04.551 --> 14:05.850
Text "jk."

14:05.886 --> 14:07.685
Text "jk"!

14:07.721 --> 14:09.554
Sir?

14:09.606 --> 14:11.589
It's been over a minute.

14:11.658 --> 14:13.391
- It's not looking good.
- Thank you, Wallace.

14:13.477 --> 14:14.559
You're just doing your job.

14:14.611 --> 14:16.043
Yes, sir.

14:16.897 --> 14:18.730
Okay, um...

14:21.735 --> 14:23.638
Let's pack it up, people.

14:25.238 --> 14:26.654
You sent one hell of a text.

14:26.740 --> 14:28.206
Thank you. We-we all, we all sent

14:28.241 --> 14:29.741
one hell of a text.

14:29.793 --> 14:31.493
Look!

14:31.578 --> 14:33.344
Th-the things, th-the little bubbly things!

14:33.413 --> 14:34.996
She's writing back, she's responding.

14:56.686 --> 14:58.676
I'm going out with Laura.

15:45.294 --> 15:47.127
Just wanted to make sure he had his order.

15:47.162 --> 15:48.461
Oh, okay.

15:48.497 --> 15:49.829
Well, we did it.

15:49.915 --> 15:50.830
We did it.

15:50.883 --> 15:51.831
We're here.

15:51.917 --> 15:53.383
Yep.

15:53.468 --> 15:57.137
It's, uh, you know, it's pretty, uh, crazy
that we, uh, met on the train.

15:57.172 --> 15:58.471
Yeah, y-y-yeah.

15:58.507 --> 15:59.973
It's so... It's so crazy.

16:00.008 --> 16:01.346
Yeah. Um...

16:01.366 --> 16:02.562
But, you know, not, like, crazy bad.

16:02.582 --> 16:04.227
No. No, it-it's definitely good crazy.

16:04.313 --> 16:05.696
It's definitely... Oh, y-y-yeah.

16:05.781 --> 16:07.564
Like something from a romantic comedy.

16:07.649 --> 16:09.412
Yes, like, uh, um...

16:10.986 --> 16:12.369
When Harry met Sally.

16:12.454 --> 16:14.237
Yes, th-that's a romantic comedy.

16:14.323 --> 16:15.822
Yeah.

16:15.874 --> 16:18.241
Um... Sleepless in Seattle.

16:18.327 --> 16:19.376
- Also a romantic comedy.
- Yeah.

16:19.461 --> 16:20.627
- Y-y-y-yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

16:20.662 --> 16:22.629
Must love dogs.

16:22.664 --> 16:23.797
What?

16:23.832 --> 16:25.165
Uh... uh...

16:25.217 --> 16:26.917
It's a romantic comedy.

16:27.002 --> 16:28.468
Oh, I'll have to see that one.

16:28.504 --> 16:30.456
Yeah, oh, y-you definitely do.

16:33.142 --> 16:35.008
Hmm.

16:37.229 --> 16:39.012
J-Jerry Maguire.

16:41.850 --> 16:43.850
What?

16:43.902 --> 16:45.685
J-Jerry Maguire.

16:56.624 --> 16:59.199
Is it, is it...
H-how is it?

16:59.251 --> 17:01.034
It's really sweet.

17:01.086 --> 17:02.919
Do you want, do you want to get,
uh, something else?

17:03.005 --> 17:04.838
No, it's fine, it's, um...

17:04.873 --> 17:06.205
It's also there were...

17:06.290 --> 17:08.040
It's also has...

17:08.093 --> 17:10.127
Is good... and fine.

17:10.212 --> 17:11.545
- I feel bad, do you want...?
- No, n-n-no.

17:11.597 --> 17:13.180
I-I'll just... I can just watch you eat.

17:13.214 --> 17:15.265
It's fine.

17:15.349 --> 17:17.550
Got water.

17:19.605 --> 17:21.387
Uh...

17:21.440 --> 17:23.390
- Oh, you first.
- No, no, you-you go first.

17:23.474 --> 17:24.608
You go first.

17:24.693 --> 17:25.724
No, you-you go first.

17:27.061 --> 17:28.228
You.

17:28.313 --> 17:29.896
Okay,

17:29.948 --> 17:33.050
I was just gonna ask you,
a-are you having an okay time?

17:34.440 --> 17:35.452
Yeah.

17:37.456 --> 17:38.572
Are you gay?

17:38.624 --> 17:39.873
What? Um...

17:39.908 --> 17:41.408
No...

17:41.460 --> 17:42.492
No.

17:42.578 --> 17:43.460
Right.

17:44.663 --> 17:45.662
Whenever you're ready.

17:45.747 --> 17:47.380
Thank you.

17:47.416 --> 17:49.082
I-I got this.

17:49.168 --> 17:50.467
Um, how about we split it?

17:50.552 --> 17:52.419
Oh, n-n-n-no, please, I'm, uh, a gentleman.

17:52.471 --> 17:54.004
I... allow me.

17:54.089 --> 17:56.139
Let's split it.

17:59.845 --> 18:01.094
Okay, bye.

18:47.809 --> 18:48.725
O-okay, guys, that's...

18:48.810 --> 18:49.969
Y-you can stop.

18:50.242 --> 18:51.384
Where is Laura?

18:51.404 --> 18:52.525
When does she come?

18:52.545 --> 18:53.890
Uh, sh-she doesn't come.

18:53.910 --> 18:56.186
Uh, the date didn't really go very well.

18:56.206 --> 18:58.018
This is disappointment.

18:58.104 --> 19:00.688
I have high hopes that
this was going to happen.

19:00.773 --> 19:02.156
Yeah, yeah.

19:02.191 --> 19:03.691
I, uh, I kind of felt the same way.

19:03.743 --> 19:06.843
I know, we do concert for one.

19:08.364 --> 19:10.081
Uh, that's very nice of you,

19:10.166 --> 19:13.000
but, uh, I kind of think I just
want to be alone right now.

19:13.035 --> 19:14.535
So if you guys just want to pack it up,
that's...

19:14.587 --> 19:16.705
Oh, okay, I understand.

19:17.375 --> 19:18.690
Thank you.

19:20.093 --> 19:21.342
Eh. Love.

19:22.908 --> 19:24.911
It's a crazy thing.

19:24.931 --> 19:29.068
One day you're up, and then you're down.

19:29.088 --> 19:30.371
But you listen to me.

19:30.391 --> 19:35.003
One day you will find a beautiful woman.

19:35.023 --> 19:37.407
And she will be warm.

19:37.492 --> 19:38.858
And giving.

19:38.944 --> 19:42.862
And she will deserve... your love.

19:42.915 --> 19:44.197
Okay.

19:44.283 --> 19:45.699
Thank you, thank you.

19:45.784 --> 19:47.617
I-I appreciate... I needed to hear that.

19:47.703 --> 19:48.702
Okay.

19:48.754 --> 19:49.869
And one more thing.

19:49.955 --> 19:51.871
Yeah.

19:51.924 --> 19:54.841
Can I use your bathroom?

19:55.447 --> 19:56.626
Oh, yeah, of course,
yeah, right-right there.

19:56.712 --> 19:58.962
Oh, thank you.

19:59.047 --> 20:01.131
Eh...

20:01.216 --> 20:03.049
Is a number two.

20:03.101 --> 20:04.384
Uh... okay.

20:04.436 --> 20:06.019
Jan, he makes a joke.

20:06.054 --> 20:08.555
We have pierogi for dinner,

20:08.640 --> 20:10.473
and he take pepper flake top off,

20:10.559 --> 20:13.310
and he put too much.

20:13.395 --> 20:15.061
- Oh, my God.
