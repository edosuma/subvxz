- Okay.

25:45.968 --> 25:48.387
No, not that one.

25:48.471 --> 25:50.973
- This one.
- No, no, this one.

25:51.098 --> 25:53.976
What's the difference, Eva?
They're the same thing.

25:53.976 --> 25:55.978
This is your outfit.

25:57.563 --> 26:00.441
If you behave yourself,
he'll put your name on it.

26:00.566 --> 26:02.568
Okay? All right.

26:02.568 --> 26:06.197
Now, when it's bloody...

find that you can't do this...

26:11.494 --> 26:13.871

to say something.

26:13.871 --> 26:16.666
- This is not for everybody.
- I know. Thank you.

26:16.666 --> 26:19.669
You stick with Elena.
She'll show you...

26:19.669 --> 26:22.838

Hurry up, Eva!
Come on!

26:29.178 --> 26:31.597
Oh, no, no.
You carry it.

26:31.681 --> 26:34.183
- No. Look at me.
I can't carry everything.
- No. No, you carry it.

26:34.266 --> 26:37.019
- You want to take
that gallon, you carry it.
- No.

27:03.295 --> 27:05.965
Let's get goin'.

27:05.965 --> 27:08.634
Give me a hand.

27:13.723 --> 27:15.725
How long have you worked
for Mr. Roger?

27:15.725 --> 27:19.478
Since I moved down
from Orlando. Six years.

27:19.562 --> 27:21.772
Orlando.
I know Orlando.

27:21.856 --> 27:24.567
- Oh, yeah? What were you there for?
- Disney World.

27:24.692 --> 27:27.862
When my mother and my sister
and my nieces came up from Colombia.

27:27.945 --> 27:30.156
- Yeah?
- It was wonderful.

27:30.239 --> 27:32.783
Everybody there
was having a good time.

27:32.867 --> 27:35.244
Children, old people.

27:35.328 --> 27:38.664
Do you like Epcot
or the Magic Kingdom?

27:38.664 --> 27:41.167
Epcot, I guess.

27:41.250 --> 27:44.170
I like the Magic Kingdom.

27:50.968 --> 27:53.387
Come here.

27:55.723 --> 27:58.476
Did you work on any
of the Blue Blood jobs?

27:58.476 --> 28:00.853
Yep. One.

28:00.853 --> 28:02.980
When?

28:03.064 --> 28:06.484
The first one. And
I don't wanna do any more.

28:06.484 --> 28:09.945
- Why?
- The bonus isn't worth it.

28:14.575 --> 28:17.787
On-- On the one
that you did do...

28:19.872 --> 28:21.874
what did he do to her?

28:21.957 --> 28:24.043
What?

28:24.126 --> 28:27.588
[ Chuckles ]
He killed her.

28:27.672 --> 28:29.590
Where was she?

28:31.342 --> 28:33.219
In the bedroom.

28:33.344 --> 28:35.596
Where?

28:35.680 --> 28:39.183
On the floor, in front of the mirror.
Look, I don't want to get into this.

28:39.183 --> 28:41.894
He chopped off her head
in front of the mirror?

28:41.977 --> 28:44.271
Maybe he wanted
to look at himself.

28:44.355 --> 28:48.442
Look, I don't want to talk about this,
uh, sicko mass murderer, okay?

28:48.442 --> 28:51.278
No, no,
he's a serial killer.

28:51.362 --> 28:55.199
A mass murderer goes into Burger Mundo
or someplace and kills everybody.

28:57.952 --> 29:00.746
Wait right here.
I'll be right back.

30:01.932 --> 30:04.018
Gabriela, wait!

30:09.148 --> 30:12.234
Don't do anything.
Just stand there and let me show you.

30:12.234 --> 30:14.695
<i>I don't want you
smearing it, okay?</i>

30:14.779 --> 30:17.698
I always get rid
of this first.

30:32.171 --> 30:35.633
- Scrubbing bubbles.
- You don't scrub with this.

30:35.758 --> 30:38.177
Just with cleanser.

30:56.320 --> 30:58.698
She was reaching
for something, maybe.

30:58.698 --> 31:01.492
- What?
- She was reaching for something.

31:01.575 --> 31:04.036
<i>- He-- Put that down! Please.
- But look!</i>

31:05.121 --> 31:07.039
Sorry.

[ Sighs ]
Gabriela, look.

31:10.251 --> 31:12.795
You're gonna have to start
listening to me, okay?

31:12.795 --> 31:16.257
I heard. You don't scrub
until you use the cleanser.

31:16.340 --> 31:18.551
No, you're gonna
have to watch me...

31:18.634 --> 31:21.220
because you are gonna have
to learn how to do this, okay?

31:21.345 --> 31:23.639

32:18.069 --> 32:20.946
this episode will hit
a little too close to home.

Because tonight, we profile

32:24.659 --> 32:26.827
of Miami's

The Blue Blood Killer.

32:34.543 --> 32:39.256
For Miami residents, it may seem
like this carnivorous hunter
has been playing...

32:39.340 --> 32:43.594
his most dangerous of dangerous
games for a lifetime.

32:43.594 --> 32:46.597
But in actual fact, it was
only three months ago...

declared hunting season...

inside the scene of the crime.

much when I put this stuff on, you know?

- I-I checked around.

Now, the victim's wife
just called.

35:11.200 --> 35:15.830
She found a couple of skull
fragments under the dining room
table that y'all missed.

this 300-pound corpse.

Bye-bye, coroner's office.

35:48.654 --> 35:53.951
All because two clock-watchin'
slack-asses...

35:53.993 --> 35:58.539

the concept of teamwork.

35:58.622 --> 36:01.834

to watch out for each other out there.

- Don't worry, we will.

36:07.506 --> 36:09.925

36:53.302 --> 36:56.931
No... she didn't.

37:02.144 --> 37:07.149
I don't think so. She's just...
sort of weird, you know?

- What is it?

be interested.

- There is no body there.

40:06.579 --> 40:09.582
-Just the outline.
- But there's blood and everything.

40:09.582 --> 40:12.710
Yes. You can really
see how it happened.

You can see exactly
how it happened.

Whew! I don't think
I could do that.

Aren't you curious?

Yes, but--

- Oh, my God. Disgusting!
- That man lives like a pig.

42:52.078 --> 42:54.914
The only good thing about the place was,
the guy's brother--

42:54.997 --> 42:57.500
he let us in--
he was really good looking.

42:57.500 --> 42:59.794
- Yeah? [ Laughs ]
- He was okay.

42:59.794 --> 43:02.672
Oh, come on, he was not
just okay. I saw you looking.

43:05.675 --> 43:08.094
<i>I don't like those

Just to think that
somebody was sitting there...

43:11.514 --> 43:15.810
knowing they're about to get killed--
those are so bad.

43:15.810 --> 43:19.313
Once I heard that in France when they
cut off the head with the guillotine--

43:19.397 --> 43:22.191
this is strange--
when the head was cut off...

43:22.316 --> 43:26.070
the head knew it was cut off
for some seconds, and sometimes
it said some words.

43:26.153 --> 43:28.072
- What?
- Yes.

43:28.155 --> 43:31.117
And the people who watched
all wanted to see if they could talk.

So they held them up.
Just something like, help!

- Oh, Gabriela!
- Gabriela.

43:36.580 --> 43:39.458
- I'm not making it up.
-Just a head without a body
couldn't talk.

43:39.583 --> 43:42.086
- The brain could still think.
- This is sick.

43:42.211 --> 43:44.213
Not all of the heads talked.
Only some.

43:44.296 --> 43:47.008
Well, I'd say, "Fuck you
for chopping off my head."

Yes. It's curious.

- Yeah. I don't know how it got there.

there's a name by the body.

- No, no, no. I can't tell Elena.
