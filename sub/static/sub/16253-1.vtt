"Where are you?"

00:57.800 --> 00:59.712
"Can you wave?"

01:14.040 --> 01:16.760
"Did you see?"

01:16.960 --> 01:19.520
"What's nearby?"

01:30.360 --> 01:33.239
There's a mailbox.

01:42.960 --> 01:50.960
A BRIDE FOR RIP VAN WINKLE

02:02.280 --> 02:03.680
Are you Nanami?

02:04.680 --> 02:05.750
Yes, I am.

02:06.120 --> 02:07.349
I'm Tetsuya.

02:08.400 --> 02:09.595
Hello.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.593
I'm sorry to keep you.

02:11.680 --> 02:15.310
I actually got here early
so I wandered around...

02:15.680 --> 02:17.194
...and actually got lost.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.039
I totally panicked.

02:19.120 --> 02:23.114
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I managed to get back.

02:25.640 --> 02:29.395
I found a nice cafe over there.

02:29.920 --> 02:32.674
- Should we try it out?
- Sure.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.439
It's around the corner.

02:44.320 --> 02:47.631
It must be hard finding
a public teaching job.

02:47.640 --> 02:51.236
I barely managed to get in.

02:53.640 --> 02:56.279
I'm also a part-time teacher.

02:56.280 --> 02:57.350
That's right.

02:57.880 --> 03:01.874
I'm aiming for full-time,
but it's not easy.

03:02.000 --> 03:08.349
It's only getting harder
with people having fewer kids.

03:09.120 --> 03:11.919
I found my boyfriend on
an internet dating site.

03:15.080 --> 03:20.712
It was too easy, like I
was shopping online.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.872
He was an easy find for me.

03:26.240 --> 03:27.959
So does that make me...

03:28.040 --> 03:33.320
...an easy girlfriend for him?

03:37.520 --> 03:39.910
Like buying something online...

03:40.280 --> 03:43.512
...easy... with just one click.

03:46.280 --> 03:48.511
I'm going to the store.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.192
I'll go with you.

03:51.880 --> 03:54.759
You're not even up yet.

03:55.360 --> 03:56.999
You must be tired.

04:01.840 --> 04:03.991
Please get some rest.

04:22.840 --> 04:28.438
"written and directed by iwai shunji"

04:33.240 --> 04:34.913
No running in the halls!

04:38.000 --> 04:39.912
- Morning!
- Good morning.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.595
Stand up!

04:45.000 --> 04:46.229
Take your seats.

04:48.760 --> 04:49.989
Face front...

04:50.680 --> 04:52.034
...and bow.

04:53.320 --> 04:54.674
Sit down.

05:00.840 --> 05:01.956
What is this?

05:03.200 --> 05:06.511
Please use that from now on.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.593
We can't hear you.

05:09.840 --> 05:11.069
We're just joking!

05:11.320 --> 05:13.277
No, it's no joke.

05:15.760 --> 05:18.150
We will now start the lesson.

05:18.440 --> 05:19.590
Open to page 27...

05:19.600 --> 05:21.751
We still can't hear you!

05:23.200 --> 05:25.157
You can use the microphone.

05:25.520 --> 05:26.670
Use it.

05:30.320 --> 05:31.549
She's really doing it.

05:35.040 --> 05:38.033
We will now start the lesson.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.960
Open your books to page 27.

05:58.400 --> 06:00.198
Good afternoon.

06:04.920 --> 06:06.673

L LL

06:09.880 --> 06:11.951
$3.24...

06:14.640 --> 06:16.040
$1.08...

06:16.960 --> 06:18.360
Is that you, Nanami?

06:20.000 --> 06:21.400
It's me, Mami.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.797
You were an education major.

06:25.560 --> 06:26.835
Oh, it's you!

06:27.040 --> 06:29.600
Long time no see!

06:29.760 --> 06:30.716
It is.

06:30.720 --> 06:33.633
- You work here?
- Yeah.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.438
I live right nearby.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.238
What time do you get off?

06:39.320 --> 06:40.720
Let's grab dinner.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.038
I work until 5pm.

06:46.640 --> 06:48.950
It's almost time.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.520
Did you wait?

06:53.920 --> 06:55.149
Not at all.

06:55.720 --> 06:57.791
- Shall we?
- Okay.

06:59.640 --> 07:01.438
How about we do hot pot at my place?

07:01.600 --> 07:02.795
Hot pot?

07:03.120 --> 07:05.635
I have some chicken waiting for me.

07:05.840 --> 07:07.832
But it's too much for me.

07:07.920 --> 07:09.513
And some tsukune too.

07:10.160 --> 07:12.880
It's cute how you call them by names.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.236
You think?

07:15.600 --> 07:16.829
Then come on over.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.035
I'll cook.

07:18.840 --> 07:19.591
Thanks.

07:19.600 --> 07:20.600
Over here.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.593
You surprised me.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.999
I would've guessed you to be a teacher.

07:32.040 --> 07:34.191
I'm also a teacher.

07:34.520 --> 07:35.954
But it's only part-time.

07:36.960 --> 07:38.030
I see.

07:40.400 --> 07:41.436
Thanks.

07:43.080 --> 07:44.912
Did you wear glasses?

07:46.960 --> 07:48.792
These are fake.

07:50.560 --> 07:54.349
I don't want my students seeing me working.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.793
But it was obvious.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.072
Really? These didn't work?

07:59.200 --> 08:00.429
Not one bit.

08:01.400 --> 08:02.993
Is your school nearby?

08:03.840 --> 08:05.752
My school isn't around here.

08:06.200 --> 08:09.079
But I couldn't work anywhere nearby.

08:14.520 --> 08:16.034
What about you?

08:16.880 --> 08:18.314
What do you do?

08:18.560 --> 08:19.835
A hostess.

08:20.240 --> 08:21.515
Hostess?

08:22.320 --> 08:23.800
A hostess club.

08:26.800 --> 08:28.712
What does that mean?

08:29.800 --> 08:33.111
I bet you make a lot of money there.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.080
Are you interested?

08:37.919 --> 08:39.115
I can't.

08:39.120 --> 08:41.840
Why not? You're not confident?

08:43.000 --> 08:44.195
Why not?

08:44.280 --> 08:45.350
You're cute.

08:45.720 --> 08:47.279
No, I'm not.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.239
It's a lot of fun.

08:50.440 --> 08:52.511
You just talk for work.

08:52.520 --> 08:54.716
Jobs are all the same...

08:54.720 --> 08:56.677
...and money is important.

08:57.160 --> 09:01.996
I can't go that far for money.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.277
My parents would kill me if they knew.

09:04.600 --> 09:07.798
They think I'm still trying to find a job.

09:08.080 --> 09:09.833
So they're still helping me out.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.111
Thank you for coming in.

09:40.120 --> 09:41.918
Not at all.

09:42.040 --> 09:44.999
Are things at school going well?

09:45.040 --> 09:47.236
Yes, I'm getting by.

09:47.880 --> 09:50.759
We got a call from your school.

09:57.560 --> 10:00.678
Is it true you use a microphone in class?

10:01.680 --> 10:04.593
It's not like that.

10:05.720 --> 10:07.120
It was just once.

10:07.720 --> 10:10.838
I took a student's joke seriously.

10:11.520 --> 10:15.230
I was lectured by the head teacher as well.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.513
It was just once.

10:18.400 --> 10:21.359
Teachers shouldn't be using microphones.

10:22.160 --> 10:23.435
I'm sorry.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.439
It won't happen again.

10:26.160 --> 10:30.279
We weren't offered
another term from the client...

10:30.600 --> 10:32.796
...so your term will be up
at the end of the month.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.913
I'm fired?

10:37.280 --> 10:40.591
Unfortunately in this case, yes.

10:41.880 --> 10:46.830
If I may, a weak voice is
fatal for a school teacher.

10:48.120 --> 10:49.236
I'm sorry.

10:50.840 --> 10:54.151
When will I get my next assignment?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.600
It's hard to say.

10:56.840 --> 10:59.400
Other teachers are waiting too.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.596
Good evening, Kanon.

11:18.400 --> 11:19.834
Good evening.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.518
Did you go outside today?

11:24.840 --> 11:25.990
No.

11:26.440 --> 11:27.920
You stayed home?

11:28.160 --> 11:29.196
Yes.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.036
I see.

11:31.800 --> 11:36.238
Let's start on page 23
with some linear functions.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.560
You have 20 minutes.

11:39.920 --> 11:42.913
You can ask me questions anytime.

11:43.680 --> 11:46.593
Ready... begin.

11:51.200 --> 11:53.920
Excuse me?

11:56.400 --> 11:57.675
Yes?

11:59.360 --> 12:01.591
If there are 'linear' functions...

12:01.840 --> 12:03.957
...are there also 'non-linear' functions?

12:08.800 --> 12:11.076
That's right.

12:11.520 --> 12:13.079
Is that it?

12:13.360 --> 12:16.239
And cubic functions.

12:17.840 --> 12:21.629
What are these used for in the real world?

12:23.240 --> 12:27.280
Well... I'm not sure.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.993
You don't know?

12:32.280 --> 12:33.396
I'm sorry.

12:34.200 --> 12:35.873
I'll look it up for you.

12:40.440 --> 12:41.440
Good afternoon.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.592
Please watch your step.

12:50.720 --> 12:55.237
Today we are blessed with
some lovely weather.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.199
We shall now hold the engagement ceremony.

13:01.120 --> 13:03.077
We humbly request your favor.

13:03.560 --> 13:04.560
Thank you.

13:13.160 --> 13:17.916
Please accept this betrothal gift
from the Tsuruoka family.

13:33.440 --> 13:36.433
Please accept this betrothal gift...

13:37.400 --> 13:40.313
...courtesy of the Minagawa family.

13:45.880 --> 13:51.558
Imagine my surprise
when I heard they met online.

13:51.920 --> 13:55.197
I'm sure you were as concerned as I was.

13:55.600 --> 14:01.790
But leave it to my daughter
to choose a school teacher.

14:02.560 --> 14:05.439
You can meet anyone online, right?

14:05.440 --> 14:08.911
Doctors! Millionaires!

14:09.200 --> 14:10.839
You've got choices!

14:11.080 --> 14:13.276
That's the perk of the internet!

14:13.960 --> 14:16.714
Nanami was never adventurous.

14:17.000 --> 14:22.632
When she took a liking to azuki bread,
that was all she ate.

14:23.880 --> 14:29.160
Then I suppose she'll never
get tired of my boy either.

14:29.280 --> 14:33.513
I'll say! She'll adore him forever.

14:33.800 --> 14:37.271
You want to continue
teaching after marriage?

14:38.200 --> 14:39.953
Yes, I do.

14:40.120 --> 14:43.192
Once you've taught, it's
not easy to give up.

14:43.520 --> 14:47.070
That's just how teachers are.

14:47.320 --> 14:51.394
But housework is hard work.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.911
Even more when you have kids.

14:54.200 --> 14:55.793
I wasn't so difficult.

14:55.960 --> 14:57.713
Are you kidding?

14:58.040 --> 15:00.999
Do you know how much trouble you were?

15:02.360 --> 15:07.037
In grade school, he took to teasing
the girl sitting next to him.

15:07.520 --> 15:10.718
But oh, that was your first love.

15:11.040 --> 15:14.078
Mom, stop it!

15:15.000 --> 15:17.834
Seriously!

15:18.200 --> 15:19.634
It's the truth.

15:23.880 --> 15:25.155
Go on ahead.

15:25.280 --> 15:27.192
Really? Alright then.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.869
You're both going to the station.

15:40.280 --> 15:42.920
And spend more time with that woman?

15:47.040 --> 15:49.111
We just have to last until
the wedding is over.

15:50.640 --> 15:52.393
A couple for appearance's sake.

15:53.160 --> 15:55.391
Even though we couldn't be further from it.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.599
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

16:01.200 --> 16:02.600
Don't mention it.

16:03.680 --> 16:06.878
The two of us didn't work out...

16:07.960 --> 16:09.792
...but I know you'll be fine.

16:10.600 --> 16:12.717
How do you know that?

16:13.280 --> 16:15.317
I don't.

16:18.320 --> 16:19.879
But you know...

16:22.720 --> 16:25.394
...I want you to be happy.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.274
Especially you.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.436
The same goes for your mother.

16:34.720 --> 16:39.317
Because despite everything,
we're still your parents.

16:46.080 --> 16:48.037
Come on, taxi!

16:48.920 --> 16:50.036
Two people?

16:52.640 --> 16:54.040
No one else?

16:56.360 --> 16:58.431
We're not close with our relatives.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.229
Why not?

17:02.200 --> 17:06.353
No particular reason.

17:08.440 --> 17:11.319
There's a ceremony for relatives.

17:12.720 --> 17:15.109
The numbers can't be too lopsided.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.958
We'll cut down on my side.

17:22.119 --> 17:27.194
But seriously though,
isn't there anyone else?

17:27.400 --> 17:30.154
You can't tell me it's only two people.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.920
It's embarrassing.

17:32.800 --> 17:34.996
Can't you do something?

17:35.640 --> 17:39.680
I also decided to quit teaching.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.435
What?

17:46.440 --> 17:48.796
Your mother was against it...

17:49.800 --> 17:55.000
...and I'm not sure I can
balance home and work.

18:01.960 --> 18:03.917
You thought this through, right?

18:06.160 --> 18:08.117
Why didn't you ask me?

18:14.760 --> 18:16.080
I'm sorry.

18:19.800 --> 18:22.838
Weddings are so depressing.

18:23.120 --> 18:25.794
I need more relatives.

18:26.160 --> 18:29.915
He says he's inviting 20 people.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.954
Wedding attendees can be...

18:40.080 --> 18:41.275
...fakes?

18:42.640 --> 18:46.190
Are you serious?

18:46.440 --> 18:47.590
What?

18:48.200 --> 18:49.395
Nothing.

18:51.120 --> 18:53.077
You hire them.

18:53.200 --> 18:55.715
I know an organizer who does this.

18:57.680 --> 18:59.273
Are you interested?

19:02.680 --> 19:04.751
Isn't it dangerous?

19:07.400 --> 19:10.279
It's legit. I guarantee it.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.431
Mr. Ramba Ral...

19:17.400 --> 19:19.551
A guarantee...

19:19.880 --> 19:22.236
What can I do with a guarantee?

19:27.360 --> 19:29.317
Wait!

19:29.760 --> 19:33.390
- Congratulations!
- These are for you!

19:35.400 --> 19:36.629
Let's take some pictures.

19:36.920 --> 19:37.920
I'm next to her!

19:38.040 --> 19:39.235
No, I want to...

19:40.080 --> 19:41.958
Say cheese!

19:42.880 --> 19:46.954
Instead of being fired,
I said it was my engagement.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.398
Do you think this is a white lie?

19:50.400 --> 19:51.595
Please be well!

19:51.840 --> 19:53.194
Thank you.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.039
Goodbye, everyone.

19:55.160 --> 19:56.958
Bye!

20:28.320 --> 20:29.320
Excuse me...

20:29.920 --> 20:31.070
Oh, hello.

20:31.640 --> 20:33.393
I'm Nanami.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.993
Please, sit down.

20:35.280 --> 20:38.637
Excuse me! Could we get the menu?

20:39.280 --> 20:40.280
Thank you.

20:44.520 --> 20:45.556
Thank you.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.395
I'll be using this name today.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.113
- Mr. Amuro?
- Yes.

20:55.640 --> 20:57.393
Yukimasu Amuro of Amuro Ltd.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.436
And truth be told, I'm also an actor.

21:02.360 --> 21:03.953
- An actor?
- That's right.

21:05.360 --> 21:06.760
Raizo Ichikawa.

21:06.880 --> 21:07.880
Yes.

21:08.240 --> 21:10.550
Wasn't there already an actor by this name?

21:12.080 --> 21:13.309
I borrowed it.

21:13.800 --> 21:15.439
And now, I'm the 2nd generation.

21:16.520 --> 21:19.399
For an actor, your real
name doesn't matter.

21:19.920 --> 21:25.200
Until the job is finished,
the role is who you are.

21:25.640 --> 21:28.633
So you can have an
infinite number of names.

21:29.600 --> 21:32.195
The same goes for you too, right?

21:33.640 --> 21:35.154
No, I don't.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.880
But what about "Clammbon"?

21:40.160 --> 21:45.440
By that, I guess everyone
has a lot of names.

21:45.600 --> 21:46.556
That's right.

21:46.560 --> 21:49.280
But today I'm not "Raizo Ichikawa"...

21:50.040 --> 21:52.919
...but "Yukimasu Amuro."

21:53.520 --> 21:55.000
Pleased to meet you.

21:57.240 --> 22:00.039
What sort of company is Amuro Ltd.?

22:00.120 --> 22:01.315
A jack of all trades.

22:01.840 --> 22:02.876
We do anything.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.039
That is, anything I can.

22:06.240 --> 22:10.632
- Let me first explain our services.
- Yes, please.

22:10.640 --> 22:14.031
Please refer to our company as "Aznable".

22:14.200 --> 22:18.592
The basic package of ceremony
attendance is $80/day.

22:19.040 --> 22:21.430
Additional speeches are $50.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.030
Entertainers for $50,
and telegrams for $30.

22:24.280 --> 22:27.000
If there's anything else,
we'll be able to provide it.

22:28.040 --> 22:29.156
Please take a look.

22:32.360 --> 22:35.910
It isn't cheap.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.156
No, but since you're Ramba Ral's friend...

22:39.680 --> 22:41.034
...I'll give you a discount.

22:43.000 --> 22:45.071
Good evening, Kanon.

22:46.640 --> 22:49.394
Good evening, I'm Kanon's mother.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.231
I read your e-mail.

22:52.360 --> 22:54.511
Congratulations on your engagement.

22:56.280 --> 22:57.873
Thank you very much.

22:59.240 --> 23:02.551
Pardon my asking, but do you have to quit?

23:04.800 --> 23:06.519
I apologize.

23:07.040 --> 23:12.115
I'm really... I have to say that...

23:12.200 --> 23:15.796
My daughter only wants you as her teacher.

23:16.200 --> 23:17.200
What?

23:17.320 --> 23:19.437
Could you continue her lessons?

23:26.520 --> 23:29.672
There are much better teachers out there.

23:29.840 --> 23:32.071
She doesn't want anyone else.

23:33.080 --> 23:36.198
She hasn't been to school in 5 months.

23:37.080 --> 23:41.950
For my daughter, you are
her one and only teacher.

23:42.360 --> 23:45.432
Could you please try? Even once a week?

23:49.840 --> 23:51.797
Okay.

23:52.160 --> 23:53.992
If you insist.

23:54.880 --> 23:55.880
You will?

23:56.880 --> 23:57.880
I'm so glad!

23:57.960 --> 24:00.794
I'm so sorry to trouble you.

24:02.600 --> 24:04.034
Hold on one moment.

24:04.840 --> 24:05.717
Hey Kanon...

24:05.760 --> 24:07.513
...she agreed.

24:18.760 --> 24:19.910
Excuse me.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.798
Congratulations, sir.

24:22.920 --> 24:23.990
Thank you.

24:24.440 --> 24:27.672
I'm Amuro of Aznable,
the attendance service.

24:28.520 --> 24:30.079
Pleasure to meet you.

24:31.040 --> 24:32.520
Thank you very much.

24:34.240 --> 24:35.390
Please, sit down.

24:39.200 --> 24:42.238
As your daughter has
already informed you...

24:42.640 --> 24:47.999
...for today's ceremony, we have
several replacement attendees.

24:49.560 --> 24:50.596
Won't people notice?

24:51.240 --> 24:53.800
Don't worry, we are professionals.

24:54.720 --> 24:56.279
We can't thank you enough.

24:57.040 --> 24:58.918
Thank you for having us.

24:59.800 --> 25:01.359
Thank you, everyone.

25:03.600 --> 25:04.795
You know...

25:05.720 --> 25:06.870
Hm?

25:08.360 --> 25:10.636
I'm suddenly getting nervous.

25:12.920 --> 25:13.920
Yeah.

25:24.200 --> 25:25.919
Do you know a "Clammbon"?

25:28.560 --> 25:29.914
Clammbon?

25:30.520 --> 25:31.590
You don't know?

25:33.160 --> 25:35.720
Looks like she's also getting married.

25:36.960 --> 25:39.077
I found my boyfriend on
an internet dating site.

25:39.360 --> 25:43.639
It was too easy, like I
was shopping online.

25:44.720 --> 25:47.997
If my fiancée wrote this,
it'd mean divorce.

25:48.640 --> 25:50.074
I'd divorce her.

25:51.800 --> 25:55.032
I really feel sorry for this groom.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.436
This isn't you?

26:00.360 --> 26:01.589
It's not.

26:05.720 --> 26:09.760
I know we also met online...

26:12.920 --> 26:14.593
...but let's try to be happy.

26:56.920 --> 26:59.230
We will now exchange the rings.

27:00.080 --> 27:02.117
From the groom to the bride.

27:11.800 --> 27:13.678
From the bride to the groom.

27:23.000 --> 27:26.630
Now the groom may raise the veil.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.600
Now, will the groom...

27:37.320 --> 27:39.915
...please kiss the bride!

28:02.000 --> 28:06.517
Please give your applause to the newlyweds!

28:13.720 --> 28:19.352
Please applaud when
the knife goes into the cake.

28:20.080 --> 28:22.356
Are you ready with your cameras?

28:23.520 --> 28:26.797
Now, the cutting of the cake!

28:27.600 --> 28:29.398
Hold it right there!

28:35.080 --> 28:37.595
Some villains have entered the hall.

28:38.120 --> 28:42.353
Could they be friends of the groom?

28:42.920 --> 28:46.357
Love-Love-Lovingly Lovely Beam!

28:47.680 --> 28:50.991
What the hell is that? Stop joking around!

28:52.960 --> 28:57.273
Love-Love Love Beam.

28:58.120 --> 29:01.158
You're too kind, Tetsuya.

29:04.000 --> 29:11.396
The newlyweds will now present
their words of appreciation.

29:20.360 --> 29:21.840
Who are these little ones?

29:22.760 --> 29:23.760
What is this?

29:23.840 --> 29:27.197
Daddy, Mommy... it's me Tetsuya.

29:27.760 --> 29:33.199
Our family has a farm
so dinner is always delicious.

29:33.720 --> 29:37.714
On weekends, you'd hold
the stick out like this...

29:38.080 --> 29:39.878
...in place of a bar.

29:40.280 --> 29:43.751
That's how I learned to spin upward.

29:43.760 --> 29:47.310
In middle school, I
dedicated myself to sports.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.793
Slam! High to right field!

29:50.160 --> 29:51.435
I run home...

29:54.160 --> 29:58.552
For me, school went by
without much of anything.

29:59.320 --> 30:01.516
My grades were average too.

30:02.800 --> 30:07.795
I had no clue what I was
going to do in life.

30:09.440 --> 30:10.669
One day...

30:12.040 --> 30:13.838
...my parents said to me...

30:14.880 --> 30:18.032
We won't send you to college like that.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.999
These words changed me.

30:24.080 --> 30:27.517
I studied hard and my grades improved.

30:28.280 --> 30:30.511
I was accepted into college.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.237
On both warm and cold days...

30:37.960 --> 30:41.636
...my mom always woke up early
and made my lunch.

30:43.680 --> 30:45.797
I never thanked you...

30:46.600 --> 30:48.000
...but I should have.

30:49.000 --> 30:50.000
Thank you.

31:06.400 --> 31:12.032
And today, I work as a teacher...

31:14.800 --> 31:17.031
...and then I met Nanami.

31:22.880 --> 31:25.156
I'm also a teacher...

31:26.360 --> 31:30.149
...and then I met Tetsuya.

31:36.560 --> 31:38.597
In the long road ahead...

31:40.600 --> 31:42.512
...no matter the troubles...

31:44.840 --> 31:49.119
...we will overcome it, together.

31:52.040 --> 31:55.078
We both still have much to learn.

31:56.640 --> 31:59.838
Please kindly watch over us.

32:39.120 --> 32:40.634
I'll take that.

32:44.160 --> 32:45.196
Was this good?

32:46.800 --> 32:48.439
- I'm off.
- Take care.

32:50.720 --> 32:52.074
Have a good day!

33:37.160 --> 33:38.196
Hi Nanami.

33:38.440 --> 33:39.840
Good afternoon.

33:42.160 --> 33:43.913
How do you like married life?

33:45.520 --> 33:47.113
I'm not so sure.

33:47.720 --> 33:50.280
You hadn't written your
blog, so I was worried.

33:51.760 --> 33:53.831
I changed my account.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.713
Can you scan my ID?

33:56.720 --> 33:57.756
Sure.

33:58.680 --> 34:00.194
One moment.

34:03.920 --> 34:05.195
Is this it?

34:06.400 --> 34:07.400
Okay.

34:12.280 --> 34:14.748
Campanella...

34:15.520 --> 34:17.318
From the book, "Night on the
Galactic Railroad."

34:17.320 --> 34:18.833
I'm a fan of Kenji Miyazawa.

34:20.639 --> 34:23.074
I used to blog whatever I wanted...

34:23.920 --> 34:25.434
...then my husband found it.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.114
I understand your want for freedom.

34:29.320 --> 34:33.712
I told him it wasn't me,
but he still suspects something.

34:34.679 --> 34:36.876
He's acting rather distant.

34:39.639 --> 34:41.120
The marriage blues?

34:42.560 --> 34:44.074
That'd be a relief.

35:00.120 --> 35:02.191
I found this on the floor.

35:04.000 --> 35:07.550
It's a woman's earring, isn't it?

35:10.760 --> 35:12.160
And so... um...

35:12.360 --> 35:13.510
I understand.

35:14.080 --> 35:16.720
Is your husband having an affair?

35:18.120 --> 35:19.120
Yes.

35:19.200 --> 35:20.919
That is what I want...

35:21.840 --> 35:24.878
But I thought to ask the price first.

35:25.240 --> 35:27.835
It's usually around $300/day.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.314
It depends on the time.

35:30.440 --> 35:33.239
But it usually gets to
around $5,000 to $10,000.

35:34.160 --> 35:35.355
$10,000...

35:35.760 --> 35:37.274
That's a lot of money.

35:37.280 --> 35:39.636
I'll give you a discount
as Ramba Ral's friend.

35:40.560 --> 35:43.758
How about $3,000 total? No more, no less.

35:44.600 --> 35:46.353
That's still expensive.

35:46.360 --> 35:48.750
You can pay me in installments.

35:48.760 --> 35:50.911
A little bit at a time.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.114
For Ramba Ral.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.952
Do you like chocolates?

36:02.240 --> 36:03.240
What?

36:04.000 --> 36:05.116
Yes, I do.

36:06.040 --> 36:07.156
Would you like one?

36:08.880 --> 36:10.872
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

36:12.960 --> 36:14.155
What can I say...

36:14.640 --> 36:19.271
Men and women don't change,
just because of marriage.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.673
Don't get your hopes up.

36:22.840 --> 36:27.357
So I should just sit there
while my husband has an affair?

36:28.080 --> 36:30.993
That might be one way to say it.

36:32.920 --> 36:36.038
Trifles of love are never ending.

36:38.360 --> 36:40.192
You might be right.

36:41.760 --> 36:45.800
My mother ran off with a younger man.

36:46.760 --> 36:48.353
That's nothing new.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.879
She's not just a mother, but a woman too.

36:54.040 --> 36:58.000
Say if I wanted it, you'd
be mine in an hour.

36:59.520 --> 37:01.716
Aren't you confident.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.514
It's not confidence.

37:04.280 --> 37:07.990
If you fall for me, it
wouldn't be my fault.

37:09.640 --> 37:11.518
It'd be yours.

37:13.960 --> 37:15.553
What do you mean?

37:18.240 --> 37:20.596
You fall... only because you want to.

37:24.080 --> 37:25.070
I have feelings for you?

37:25.080 --> 37:26.196
Not at all!

37:26.400 --> 37:28.596
You don't care a bit about me.

37:30.800 --> 37:33.520
Here, have another chocolate.

37:39.320 --> 37:40.879
Here you go.

37:44.960 --> 37:46.952
This distance between us...

37:51.160 --> 37:54.312
...you're the one who came to me.

38:02.160 --> 38:04.595
Wanting to depend on someone...

38:06.160 --> 38:08.277
...trying to fill some void...

38:13.240 --> 38:14.913
You should be careful.

38:22.200 --> 38:25.591
I'll let you know if I find anything.

38:42.880 --> 38:43.880
Hello?

38:44.040 --> 38:46.555
Excuse me, could I have a word?

38:47.080 --> 38:48.080
Yes?

38:48.280 --> 38:50.397
It's about your husband.

38:51.920 --> 38:52.920
Yes?

38:53.640 --> 38:55.632
He's having an affair with my girl.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.030
Did you know?

39:01.280 --> 39:02.350
I didn't.

39:02.920 --> 39:05.640
I'd like to talk to you.

39:08.760 --> 39:09.760
Hello?

39:10.200 --> 39:11.395
Are you there?

39:11.920 --> 39:13.673
Can I come inside?

39:21.000 --> 39:22.593
How can I help you?

39:22.960 --> 39:25.520
I already explained why I'm here.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.640
Do we talk here?

39:28.520 --> 39:29.920
I don't mind...

39:31.200 --> 39:33.715
...but your neighbors might hear us.

39:36.360 --> 39:37.360
Come in.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.993
I'm sorry it's a mess.

40:04.960 --> 40:06.713
Would you like some tea?

40:07.040 --> 40:08.190
Or some coffee?

40:08.280 --> 40:09.919
Please, don't trouble yourself.

40:17.560 --> 40:19.517
Do you have any of his yearbooks?

40:20.240 --> 40:22.038
From about 7 or 8 years ago...

40:22.680 --> 40:24.797
His yearbooks from work?

40:25.880 --> 40:27.792
Does he have them here?

40:29.640 --> 40:32.599
I'll go look in his room.

40:44.440 --> 40:45.590
Here she is.

40:48.160 --> 40:49.230
This is her.

40:50.200 --> 40:54.080
Yuka Tabata... your
husband's former student.

40:56.720 --> 41:00.634
So she is your girlfriend?

41:01.360 --> 41:02.360
That's right.

41:04.240 --> 41:08.632
She met your husband at
a reunion last year.

41:10.240 --> 41:12.800
Then they started texting...

41:14.760 --> 41:16.672
...and it got serious from there.

41:18.600 --> 41:19.954
Oh, golly...

41:20.800 --> 41:22.234
Golly?

41:22.640 --> 41:24.996
How can you be so casual?

41:26.320 --> 41:28.039
Should I call the school?

41:28.360 --> 41:31.398
Hand out flyers to his students?

41:31.400 --> 41:33.756
No, not that...

41:38.800 --> 41:40.029
Some tea...

41:41.240 --> 41:42.754
Coffee...

42:07.280 --> 42:09.192
Are you alright?

42:09.960 --> 42:10.996
Miss?

42:11.320 --> 42:12.390
Are you okay?

42:15.600 --> 42:16.829
Are you feeling okay?

42:19.800 --> 42:21.029
- I'm alright.
- Are you sure?

42:21.160 --> 42:22.160
Yes.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.034
I'm fine.

42:27.600 --> 42:28.954
I understand.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.196
Really, I do.

42:41.120 --> 42:43.635
I'll leave for today.

42:48.640 --> 42:49.790
I'm home.

42:57.560 --> 42:58.560
Hey, I'm home.

42:59.240 --> 43:00.435
Welcome home.

43:18.760 --> 43:19.830
What about dinner?

43:22.160 --> 43:23.992
I told you I was eating out.

43:25.640 --> 43:28.678
I just wanted to make sure.

43:39.840 --> 43:40.910
Come in.

43:53.400 --> 43:54.400
Please.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.200
Over here.

43:58.360 --> 43:59.360
Here.

44:03.200 --> 44:05.840
Thank you for coming.

44:06.360 --> 44:07.360
It's fine.

44:07.800 --> 44:08.800
Some wine?

44:12.960 --> 44:14.758
I broke up with her.

44:15.680 --> 44:16.680
What?

44:17.160 --> 44:19.152
I'm talking about that bitch.

44:23.040 --> 44:26.954
Just thinking about her with
someone else made me sick.

44:28.800 --> 44:29.995
It was too much.

44:31.880 --> 44:32.916
I see.

44:34.640 --> 44:37.838
I bet you can't forgive
your husband either.

44:40.240 --> 44:41.993
I suppose so.

44:43.320 --> 44:45.039
Do you want him dead?

44:47.880 --> 44:49.155
I suppose...

44:50.400 --> 44:52.073
Apparently not.

44:52.600 --> 44:54.557
No, that's not it.

44:55.120 --> 45:00.275
In any case, your husband
has to pay for his actions.

45:01.880 --> 45:04.111
This goes for me, but also you too.

45:04.600 --> 45:06.671
He has to pay the price.

45:07.760 --> 45:09.513
Pay the price?

45:10.200 --> 45:11.350
But how?

45:16.800 --> 45:20.510
What do you want him to do?

45:22.800 --> 45:25.110
I have no idea.

45:26.520 --> 45:28.113
I gave it some thought.

45:29.920 --> 45:32.230
For you to be mine for the night.

45:34.200 --> 45:37.910
I'll forget this ever happened.

45:38.200 --> 45:39.634
I'll leave this anger all to you.

45:39.640 --> 45:42.314
Do with him whatever you want.

45:46.160 --> 45:47.879
This is outrageous!

45:48.440 --> 45:49.590
What then!

45:49.920 --> 45:51.040
Are you going to pay me off?

45:51.600 --> 45:52.829
I'm not!

45:53.680 --> 45:56.354
Hand out flyers! Do whatever you want!

45:56.440 --> 45:57.715
I don't care!

45:57.720 --> 45:58.437
Oh yeah?

45:58.680 --> 46:01.036
That'll be the end for your husband.

46:01.640 --> 46:03.871
I don't care.

46:04.280 --> 46:06.590
Do whatever you want!

46:07.080 --> 46:09.390
Calm down and think about it.

46:11.440 --> 46:16.117
If this solves things,
it's good for you too.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.193
You can't forgive your husband.

46:19.320 --> 46:24.236
But still, you're scared of
losing this comfortable life.

46:26.920 --> 46:28.798
Isn't that the truth?

46:36.040 --> 46:38.157
Betraying your husband...

46:40.880 --> 46:44.032
...that only makes things even.

46:47.680 --> 46:51.754
Think of it as a fresh start.

46:58.040 --> 47:00.111
I'll be nice.

47:04.120 --> 47:08.160
Remember... we're both victims.

47:13.760 --> 47:15.956
Can I use the restroom?

47:17.800 --> 47:18.800
Go ahead.

47:38.400 --> 47:40.119
Please help me.

47:40.800 --> 47:45.875
The boyfriend of my
husband's lover is here...

47:46.720 --> 47:49.792
...and is trying to force
me to sleep with him.

47:51.680 --> 47:54.070
I've run into the restroom.

47:54.800 --> 47:56.598
What should I do...

48:00.760 --> 48:02.513
"Are you alright?"

48:03.560 --> 48:04.560
Amuro...

48:04.800 --> 48:06.871
"Where are you?"

48:09.680 --> 48:11.194
A hotel in Gotanda.

48:12.080 --> 48:16.154
Hotel Arion, room 201.

48:19.880 --> 48:22.759
I'm heading over. Try and buy some time.

48:23.320 --> 48:26.040
Take a shower.

48:33.600 --> 48:35.273
I understand.

48:40.160 --> 48:42.072
"On my way!"

48:53.160 --> 48:57.040
Can I take a shower?

49:00.800 --> 49:01.916
Really?

49:02.680 --> 49:03.830
Go right ahead.

49:04.720 --> 49:06.757
Don't be like that.

49:07.800 --> 49:10.076
Let's enjoy ourselves.

49:14.240 --> 49:16.709
Go on, now.

49:46.600 --> 49:47.750
What's this?

49:48.280 --> 49:49.953
Did you lock the door?

49:51.040 --> 49:54.750
Why don't we shower together?

49:55.640 --> 49:56.710
Hey miss...

49:58.520 --> 49:59.590
Miss!

50:01.280 --> 50:02.680
Are you listening?

50:19.640 --> 50:20.391
Hey there.

50:20.600 --> 50:21.716
- Is this good?
- Yeah.

50:21.920 --> 50:23.070
Thank goodness!

50:23.080 --> 50:24.719
I didn't know what else to do.

50:24.800 --> 50:26.996
I can't improv anymore.

50:27.080 --> 50:28.560
You did well.

50:29.000 --> 50:30.434
- Can I leave?
- Sure.

50:44.400 --> 50:45.675
You villain.

50:46.320 --> 50:47.754
Hey, Ramba Ral...

50:47.960 --> 50:48.960
What about the room?

50:49.080 --> 50:50.673
I'll take care of it.

51:21.760 --> 51:23.797
It's stuck.

52:00.040 --> 52:01.110
It's alright.

52:01.240 --> 52:02.674
He's gone.

52:03.800 --> 52:05.075
I'll take you home.

52:05.760 --> 52:07.160
I'll be outside.

52:34.360 --> 52:36.955
Your father is becoming
more like his father.

52:37.120 --> 52:38.236
Really?

52:38.520 --> 52:39.795
That's awful.

52:40.040 --> 52:42.191
The things he does and says...

52:46.000 --> 52:47.593
Grab some incense.

52:48.240 --> 52:49.720
Wait your turn.

53:09.600 --> 53:10.716
Delicious!

53:12.000 --> 53:13.070
Now for you!

53:25.040 --> 53:28.351
Everyone was really nice.

53:30.760 --> 53:31.760
Good night.

53:33.440 --> 53:34.590
Come on now.

53:37.200 --> 53:38.270
Can we talk?

53:40.760 --> 53:41.760
Of course.

53:47.800 --> 53:50.554
Your relatives at the wedding...

53:51.360 --> 53:54.034
...were they faked?

54:00.120 --> 54:02.680
I thought so.

54:06.000 --> 54:07.753
That's unbelievable.

54:09.120 --> 54:10.998
I can't believe my ears.

54:13.400 --> 54:14.959
I'm terribly sorry.

54:15.320 --> 54:18.233
I thought it improper
with so few relatives.

54:18.800 --> 54:20.632
What do you mean by 'proper'?

54:21.120 --> 54:25.114
Did we look like people
who cared about being 'proper'?

54:26.240 --> 54:30.154
Having strangers as relatives
at your own wedding...

54:30.400 --> 54:31.834
Do you even realize?

54:32.520 --> 54:33.954
I'm sorry.

54:35.760 --> 54:39.800
And about your parents...

54:40.320 --> 54:42.118
...I hear they're divorced.

54:44.560 --> 54:46.916
And your mother is living in Nagano?

54:47.520 --> 54:48.520
Yes.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.955
I hear she ran off with
some young coworker.

54:53.880 --> 54:57.191
I don't know about that.

54:57.840 --> 54:59.752
Why did you lie?

54:59.960 --> 55:01.633
You, and your parents.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.595
I apologize.

55:04.280 --> 55:05.680
I didn't mean to.

55:06.920 --> 55:09.754
And my parents too...

55:09.920 --> 55:12.116
They didn't mean any harm.

55:12.960 --> 55:14.360
I'm terribly sorry.

55:16.440 --> 55:19.672
Then how do you explain this?

55:23.160 --> 55:24.640
Can you?

55:31.400 --> 55:33.073
What is this?

55:35.200 --> 55:41.117
Can that please wait?

55:41.440 --> 55:43.750
I haven't talked to Tetsuya yet.

55:44.000 --> 55:45.832
What are you going to say?

55:46.000 --> 55:47.912
You're cheating on him?

55:47.920 --> 55:49.877
- I'm not.
- It's right there!

55:53.840 --> 55:57.629
He's the one having an affair.

55:57.960 --> 56:01.715
That man is the boyfriend
of Tetsuya's lover.

56:02.960 --> 56:04.633
One lie after the other.

56:05.520 --> 56:08.160
Then what do you have to say about this?

56:09.080 --> 56:13.120
Can I take a shower?

56:16.840 --> 56:17.876
Really?

56:19.000 --> 56:21.151
Lets enjoy ourselves.

56:21.400 --> 56:25.314
Why don't we shower together?

56:26.080 --> 56:27.080
Hey, miss...

56:28.440 --> 56:29.999
What do you have to say?

56:31.440 --> 56:33.909
Please let me talk to Tetsuya.

56:34.720 --> 56:39.670
And if we could talk tomorrow...

56:39.920 --> 56:42.913
What are you saying?
Explain yourself right now!

56:43.040 --> 56:45.509
I've been drinking and...

56:45.960 --> 56:47.189
Unbelievable.

56:49.640 --> 56:52.280
What am I suppose to believe?

56:53.760 --> 56:59.518
Right now, I can't help
but feel that you're tainted...

56:59.720 --> 57:01.074
...and filthy.

57:01.640 --> 57:03.233
I can't bare to look at you.

57:10.000 --> 57:11.593
Crying won't help you.

57:16.920 --> 57:18.639
Hiccups?

57:19.160 --> 57:20.799
You think this is a joke?

57:21.400 --> 57:22.400
I'm sorry.

57:23.800 --> 57:27.271
I'll call you a taxi
so go back to your parents!

57:28.240 --> 57:31.153
Don't come near Tetsuya again!

57:31.160 --> 57:33.277
I'll send you the divorce papers.

57:33.640 --> 57:35.313
Get them back to me!

57:35.440 --> 57:36.556
Do you understand?

58:20.040 --> 58:21.190
Good evening.

58:21.440 --> 58:25.229
Could you take her back to Iwate?

58:26.880 --> 58:29.349
Where do you live? In Hanamaki?

58:29.560 --> 58:31.517
You say Iwate but...

58:31.680 --> 58:33.831
You can keep the change.

58:52.640 --> 58:53.756
Is it too cold?

58:55.000 --> 58:56.195
Should I raise the heat?

58:59.920 --> 59:00.956
I'm okay.

59:06.160 --> 59:09.517
Please take me to Setagaya.

59:10.200 --> 59:12.317
Where in Setagaya?

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.672
Are you there?

01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:15.996
It's me.

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.200
Yes.

01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:22.279
I just spoke with my mom.

01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.310
I saw the video.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.076
What now?

01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.390
Get divorced?

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.716
I haven't done anything wrong.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.638
After taking a shower at a love hotel?

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:39.833
It wasn't a love hotel.

01:00:41.240 --> 01:00:42.515
It was a proper hotel.

01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:44.918
What are you bragging about!

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.234
I haven't done anything wrong.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.914
You're the one...

01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:53.674
...who is having the affair.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.955
Me?

01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:59.594
That man is your lover's boyfriend.

01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:01.200
You're saying it's my fault?

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:03.190
Don't be ridiculous!

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.751
Yuka Tabata, you know her don't you?

01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:07.713
Your former student.

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.600
Yuka Tabata?

01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:12.674
I've never heard of her.

01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.879
- Don't lie to me.
- I'm not!

01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.395
Yuka Tabata...

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.393
I don't know that name.

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:26.674
Hold on.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:34.160
What are you doing?

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.399
I'm looking at your yearbooks.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.679
Aren't you at your parent's?

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:45.435
I came back to Tokyo.

01:01:51.400 --> 01:01:52.516
Why...

01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.711
She was right here.

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:02.677
You're accusing me of having
an affair with this girl?

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:05.200
That's why you did it?

01:02:06.080 --> 01:02:07.799
You're unbelievable.

01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:13.594
Your relatives at the wedding,
they were all fake?

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:16.757
And your parents...

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.273
...they're divorced, right?

01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.000
Above all that...

01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.280
...how can you accuse
me of having an affair?

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:29.240
What do you think I am?

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.151
Normally, I'd be the one making claims.

01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:36.073
Either way this is it.

01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.434
I'll be back tonight.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.436
I don't want you there when I'm back.

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.597
I'm throwing away everything that's left.

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:49.393
Put the keys in the mailbox.

01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.680
Do you understand?

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.190
Do you?

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.356
Yes.

01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:05.760
Okay, then.

01:03:07.240 --> 01:03:08.240
Take care.

01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.920
Goodbye.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.116
Can you hear me?

01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.869
It's me, Amuro.

01:05:05.440 --> 01:05:06.715
Can you talk?

01:05:08.920 --> 01:05:13.676
I was hoping we could meet
regarding your inquiry.

01:05:15.880 --> 01:05:17.997
When would work for you?

01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.720
Yes...

01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:29.190
Is everything alright?

01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.519
...where am I?

01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:46.395
Where is this?

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.238
Nanami, what's wrong?

01:05:52.760 --> 01:05:58.996
I don't know where I am.

01:06:01.760 --> 01:06:04.514
Um... well... I see...

01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.357
What should I do?

01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:10.436
Please calm down.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:12.671
Open up a map on your phone...

01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.114
...and that will show you.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:23.800
Where should I go from here?

01:06:27.280 --> 01:06:29.033
I
LLL

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.675
I don't have anywhere to go.

01:06:35.560 --> 01:06:37.040
Did something happen?

01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:39.711
Did you have a fight with your husband?

01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:44.160
I'll come and get you.

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.997
Can you just tell me where...

01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:53.318
Um... right now... I'm...

01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.715
...can you hear me?

01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.314
Are you there?

01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:39.311
Do you need any cleaning done?

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:43.157
I'm alright, thanks.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:47.112
Please call us if you need anything.

01:10:56.080 --> 01:10:57.514
Excuse me?

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:58.760
Yes?

01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.600
I'm looking for a job...

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.280
Now just like I told you, see these sheets?

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.631
This makes the bed bulky.

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:19.798
Align the two together.

01:11:20.120 --> 01:11:21.156
- Got it?
- Yes.

01:11:21.400 --> 01:11:22.800
Okay, then.

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:24.395
This comes next.

01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:26.960
- Are you ok?
- I'm fine.

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:30.074
It's dusty, I know.

01:11:30.320 --> 01:11:32.437
Align the centers.

01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:36.913
Never stops, does it?

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:44.069
Do you know what 'when' means?

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:47.435
It means 'time.'

01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:50.800
That's right.

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.834
But this time, it's used
a little differently.

01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:01.911
For example, "It was
raining when I got up."

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:06.839
Did you catch a cold?

01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.310
What?

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:13.551
You seem tired.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.596
You think so?

01:12:17.800 --> 01:12:19.200
I'm alright.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.559
I see you're still alive.

01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:34.750
It's me.

01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:39.316
- I'm sorry to worry you.
- Not at all.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.754
Are you hungry?

01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.957
Thank you so much.

01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:58.070
I really feel for you.

01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.230
Thank you.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:07.280
By the way...

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:15.190
That man you met is a
relationship destroyer.

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:18.434
A what?

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:22.192
They approach you with sexual intentions...

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:25.233
...all in order to split up the couple.

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:28.359
You were played for a fool.

01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.592
They break up relationships...

01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:38.712
I didn't know there was such a thing.

01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:40.673
Everything is free game.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:46.912
What about the yearbook picture?

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.912
That's all simple enough to make.

01:13:52.160 --> 01:13:54.436
The question is who planted it?

01:13:55.440 --> 01:13:58.080
Was it that man? Or your husband?

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:02.037
Or perhaps your mother-in-law?

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:05.840
My in-laws?

01:14:06.080 --> 01:14:08.959
She's the one behind all this.

01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:12.195
And now, onto the main topic.

01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:14.396
Main topic?

01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.839
Hold on a second.

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:21.913
What you asked me to investigate.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.199
The report about your husband's infidelity.

01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:28.680
Was he?

01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:30.075
Don't be so hasty.

01:14:31.960 --> 01:14:34.839
This is the truth.

01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:37.680
What is this?

01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:40.873
It's exactly how it looks.

01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:43.751
Mother and son are having dinner.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.637
His mother had been coming
to Tokyo twice a week...

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.879
...staying at hotels all around the city.

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.835
But what for?

01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:55.274
Just to visit her son.

01:14:57.200 --> 01:14:58.270
What?

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:05.516
Didn't your husband eat
out about twice a week?

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.357
A textbook Oedipal complex.

01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.318
Are you glad it wasn't an affair?

01:15:22.880 --> 01:15:26.715
She visited your home too,
when you weren't there.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.832
I can't say for sure...

01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:33.556
...but she could have
planted the yearbook...

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:35.155
...and the earrings.

01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.718
It might not be my place...

01:15:39.320 --> 01:15:41.118
...but maybe this was for the better.

01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.073
It'll be easier that way.

01:15:59.400 --> 01:16:00.800
Why...

01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.840
Why me...

01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:11.760
Why did this family...

01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.874
Damn it...

01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.034
Damn them!

01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:31.040
Damn...

01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:32.795
Damn it.

01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.272
Damn it.

01:16:35.280 --> 01:16:36.430
God damn it.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:38.996
God damn it.

01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:40.434
Those idiots.

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.959
Those idiots...

01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:44.713
Those stupid idiots.

01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:48.877
Stupid idiots...

01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:55.718
- About the payment...
- Yes?

01:16:55.960 --> 01:16:58.031
Could you please wait?

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:01.238
Of course. You're Ramba Ral's friend.

01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:02.710
Thank you very much.

01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:04.313
Let me know if I can help.

01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:05.716
I will.

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:08.875
Oh, right!

01:17:09.240 --> 01:17:12.199
This hotel is $42/night, right?

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.077
Yes.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:17.877
So that's $1,260/month.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:19.150
Isn't that expensive?

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:23.234
You can find a decent room
around here for $300.

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.240
Did you know?

01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:26.232
- Is that true?
- Of course.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:28.350
Is that right.

01:17:29.640 --> 01:17:31.313
- Hotels are expensive.
- They are.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:34.279
- I didn't realize it.
- Are you okay?

01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.715
I feel downright crippled.

01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:38.120
You don't have to worry.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:40.391
I know people who are really like that.

01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:41.720
So you're fine.

01:17:41.840 --> 01:17:43.115
You're nothing like them.

01:17:43.520 --> 01:17:47.594
Also on Sundays, when you aren't working...

01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:50.834
I have a job this Sunday,
if you're interested.

01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:52.639
Thank you very much.

01:17:52.640 --> 01:17:54.518
- I'm available!
- Great.

01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.558
What is the job?

01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:17.634
Excuse me.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:57.393
Everyone, your attention please!

01:18:57.400 --> 01:18:59.596
Listen up, please!

01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:03.759
The papers I gave you
are your profiles for today.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.592
Please memorize it.

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:08.839
Please look at the family tree.

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:11.350
The name in red is you.

01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:13.193
Does everyone see that?

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:14.555
- Yes.
- Good.

01:19:14.680 --> 01:19:18.390
Those who are relatives,
please talk with each other.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.760
Family, siblings, friends...

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.960
It'll be a disaster if
you look like strangers.

01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.759
Thanks for your hard work.

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:31.039
Thank you.

01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:35.117
I'll be playing Kenjiro Kikkawa.

01:19:35.840 --> 01:19:37.911
My name is Kazuaki Gocho.

01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:41.074
The symbols are 'cow' and 'stomach.'

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:43.314
That's quite a name!

01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.189
And it's a great name.

01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:47.636
But it'll get confusing so...

01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:50.753
Yes, let's go by our roles.

01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:52.115
Let's do that.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.637
Now then, introduce yourself.

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:59.513
I'm Kenjiro Kikkawa. Nice to meet you.

01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:04.594
Hello, I'm Katsuyo Kikkawa.

01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:06.760
That's great.

01:20:08.720 --> 01:20:11.440
I'm Kiyomi, the eldest daughter.

01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:16.631
I'm Kasumi, her sister.

01:20:16.840 --> 01:20:18.194
Hi there, Kasumi.

01:20:18.840 --> 01:20:20.718
I'm Yusuke.

01:20:22.320 --> 01:20:25.199
Today, you are a family.

01:20:25.720 --> 01:20:28.189
Family, family. You're a family now!

01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:30.915
Get to know each other, remember to talk.

01:20:31.040 --> 01:20:32.997
You're family now.

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.275
Hey, sister.

01:20:34.880 --> 01:20:35.880
Hey brother...

01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:37.316
...father, mother...

01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:39.193
...it's a pleasure to meet you.

01:20:40.440 --> 01:20:43.512
Please welcome the newlyweds!

01:20:55.160 --> 01:20:57.516
Please welcome them with your applause.

01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.077
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:40.999
Did you go to the realtors?

01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.800
Not yet.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:44.794
Let's go together.

01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:46.195
I have a friend in real estate.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.351
- Does the same area work?
- Yes.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:51.152
Oh... right.

01:21:51.680 --> 01:21:54.798
I didn't really live there by choice.

01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.317
You just ended up there.

01:21:57.400 --> 01:21:58.072
Yes.

01:21:58.240 --> 01:21:59.151
It was fate.

01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:00.594
We'll talk later.

01:22:03.400 --> 01:22:04.675
Have you done this before?

01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:06.759
What do you think?

01:22:07.360 --> 01:22:09.033
That's all I can say.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:10.520
Wow!

01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.360
This is great.

01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.636
The groom is polygamous.

01:22:23.520 --> 01:22:24.636
What does that mean?

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:29.073
It means he already has another family.

01:22:29.240 --> 01:22:30.674
Multiple marriages.

01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.554
Isn't that illegal?

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:33.994
Of course it's illegal!

01:22:34.160 --> 01:22:35.276
Unbelievable.

01:22:35.360 --> 01:22:36.919
It's incredible.

01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:40.797
Maybe he couldn't tell her the truth...

01:22:40.920 --> 01:22:43.151
...so he had no choice but to get married.

01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:46.755
Why are you laughing?

01:22:48.840 --> 01:22:51.196
Those with cameras or phones...

01:22:51.280 --> 01:22:56.435
...please come forward
for a great photo opportunity!

01:22:56.880 --> 01:23:01.033
And now, the cutting of the cake!

01:23:20.440 --> 01:23:21.920
Congrats!

01:23:26.760 --> 01:23:28.194
Look at us.

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.557
That was so nerve wracking!

01:23:38.960 --> 01:23:40.917
Added years to my age.

01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.999
How can you keep laughing?

01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:47.391
His nerves are letting out.

01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:53.070
What do you say we all go out for a drink?

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.429
Let's go!

01:23:54.560 --> 01:23:55.914
Go go!

01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.995
Do you know a place?

01:23:58.880 --> 01:24:01.315
I know a place nearby.

01:24:01.520 --> 01:24:03.159
Why don't we try that?

01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:05.599
It's strange, though.

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:08.639
It feels like we're a real family.

01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:11.872
I know, it's very strange.

01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.639
What about your real family?

01:24:16.080 --> 01:24:18.356
Actually, I'm a bachelor.

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:19.715
Seriously?

01:24:19.800 --> 01:24:20.916
Divorced?

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:22.756
I never married.

01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:24.509
Me neither.

01:24:24.640 --> 01:24:26.233
Are you serious?

01:24:26.840 --> 01:24:29.992
What were you two doing until now?

01:24:34.320 --> 01:24:35.993
What do you do for work, Kiyomi?

01:24:36.280 --> 01:24:37.280
Me?

01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:40.840
I'm actually a real actress.

01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:44.911
But 10 years an actress with no hits.

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.954
What have you been in?

01:24:48.640 --> 01:24:50.233
Boring jobs here and there.

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:52.200
What about you?

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:57.154
I'm just getting by working part-time jobs.

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:00.680
Aren't we all.

01:25:01.240 --> 01:25:02.071
Yeah.

01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:03.434
Here's your drink.

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.518
Finally, it arrives!

01:25:05.880 --> 01:25:07.030
Time for a toast!

01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:10.800
Cheers!

01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:16.192
Who let her drink so much?

01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.037
I was nervous!

01:25:25.920 --> 01:25:27.593
My station is over there.

01:25:27.720 --> 01:25:28.915
Me too.

01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.669
You're kidding!

01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:32.319
So this is goodbye?

01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:34.315
Come home with me.

01:25:34.600 --> 01:25:35.920
Daddy!

01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.440
Daughter!

01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:42.033
- It was great meeting you.
- Thank you.

01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.879
It's like we're a real family.

01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.196
- Goodbye, then.
- Let's meet again.

01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:50.998
Be careful going home, okay?

01:25:51.680 --> 01:25:52.680
See you!

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:55.915
I'm going this way, too.

01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:00.236
Where do you live, Kiyomi?

01:26:00.320 --> 01:26:03.552
We're off the clock,
so let's stop calling me that.

01:26:04.520 --> 01:26:05.749
You're right.

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.919
I'm Mashiro Satonaka.

01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:10.670
Ms. Satonaka.

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:12.713
- Call me Mashiro.
- Okay.

01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:16.840
I'm Nanami Minagawa.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.789
What should I call you, Ms.
Nanami Minagawa?

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.240
You can call me either.

01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:24.840
Then, I choose Minagawa.

01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:27.159
Never mind! Nanami!

01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:29.269
Do you use Twitter?

01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:30.590
How about Line?

01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:33.394
I use Planet.

01:26:33.560 --> 01:26:34.789
One of the minor leagues.

01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:36.832
Let's share contacts.

01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:43.880
- So you're "Campanella"?
- Yes.

01:26:45.360 --> 01:26:46.953
Do you want to grab another drink?

01:26:47.440 --> 01:26:48.237
Count me in!

01:26:48.240 --> 01:26:49.913
Off we go, then!

01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:57.196
- You're in a good mood.
- You bet I am!

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.919
"Like a bad dream..."

01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.636
"Time whispers by..."

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:15.999
"And now I am alone..."

01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:20.240
"And still in my room is your..."

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:26.110
" a" Very own Charlie Parker...

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:30.077
"Did you forget I'm here..."

01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:36.917
Here you go.

01:27:37.320 --> 01:27:39.437
Singing like a star!

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.916
It's your turn next.

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:45.956
Would you like to try?

01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:47.357
Should I?

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:49.431
- What do you think?
- Please do.

01:28:02.240 --> 01:28:07.156
"Last night's blizzard..."

01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:11.434
"Has danced and danced..."

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:18.431
"Covering the garden whole..."

01:28:18.560 --> 01:28:22.998
There are tons of people
out there in the world!

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:25.716
Especially here in Tokyo.

01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:31.916
No one'll notice if someone
disappeared from this crowd.

01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.879
That's true.

01:28:34.760 --> 01:28:37.559
Excuse me, you forgot these!

01:28:37.760 --> 01:28:39.079
Thank you!

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.275
I'm glad I caught you.

01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:42.033
Thank you very much.

01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:43.520
You're welcome.

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.318
Look what I found!

01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:51.995
"People take all they have lost..."

01:28:53.160 --> 01:28:54.674
Mashiro?

01:28:55.600 --> 01:29:00.356
"Turning them into beautiful memories..."

01:29:01.040 --> 01:29:06.069
"So take everything you've lost..."

01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.351
"And so beautifully..."

01:29:14.720 --> 01:29:17.110
Rip Van Winkle...

01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:22.960
"Mashiro, where are you?"

01:29:24.120 --> 01:29:29.115
"As if it were nothing at all..."

01:29:29.160 --> 01:29:31.391
"Thank you for today."

01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.519
"Goodnight, Rip Van Winkle."

01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:51.429
Hi, there.

01:29:52.160 --> 01:29:53.196
Hello.

01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:55.915
- Thank you for last time.
- My pleasure.

01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:58.110
Shopping?

01:29:58.720 --> 01:29:59.995
Is that your dinner?

01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:01.913
It is.

01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:03.555
Did you go to the realtors?

01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:04.956
Not yet.

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.079
I'm free now if that works for you.

01:30:07.080 --> 01:30:08.400
Then that works out great.

01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:10.913
I have another job for you.

01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:15.554
A job?

01:30:15.800 --> 01:30:17.917
A job as a live-in maid.

01:30:18.120 --> 01:30:19.679
- A maid?
- That's right.

01:30:19.840 --> 01:30:22.036
You'll be living there
so no need to pay rent.

01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:23.838
And the pay is much better.

01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:25.710
$10,000/month.

01:30:26.600 --> 01:30:28.592
$10,000?

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:29.909
What do you say?

01:30:31.520 --> 01:30:33.000
What am I suppose to do?

01:30:33.560 --> 01:30:35.199
Normal household duties...

01:30:35.200 --> 01:30:36.760
...like cleaning and doing the laundry.

01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:38.996
Don't you want the money?

01:30:40.920 --> 01:30:42.274
US$10,000.00

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.110
Why not take a look?

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:46.600
I can drive you there.

01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:48.715
But I...

01:30:49.160 --> 01:30:50.799
I can't just quit this job.

01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.271
Another person quit last week...

01:30:53.360 --> 01:30:55.352
...so work shifts are tight.

01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.760
I see.

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.076
I'll talk to the hotel for you. Let's go.

01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.196
After you.

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.680
Go ahead.

01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.271
I'm back.

01:31:10.280 --> 01:31:12.078
Welcome back!

01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:15.071
Nanami! Forgive me! It's all my fault!

01:31:15.440 --> 01:31:17.079
I'm begging you! Please forgive me!

01:31:19.640 --> 01:31:21.950
Thank you all for looking after my wife.

01:31:22.080 --> 01:31:24.197
- Wife?
- Yes, she's my wife.

01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:26.990
I'd like to have her check out.

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.316
I'll send a replacement for her shift.

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:32.319
I'm terribly sorry for the trouble.

01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:34.393
I'm so glad she's alright!

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.239
No, not at all...

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.151
How much will it be?

01:31:37.160 --> 01:31:38.071
No we couldn't accept...

01:31:38.080 --> 01:31:40.993
No, these things are important.

01:31:42.720 --> 01:31:45.792
How much? I can't...

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:47.196
This much money...

01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.714
Don't worry about the change.

01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:52.080
Please accept my thanks.

01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.514
Thank you very much.

01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.989
You're too forceful.

01:31:58.560 --> 01:32:01.394
I wanted to be quick about it.

01:32:02.080 --> 01:32:05.312
And I had a feeling you might
just back out of this job.

01:32:05.840 --> 01:32:07.433
It'll be okay.

01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:10.555
Now let's wave, with a big smile.

01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:13.750
Here we go.

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:21.360
These are huge mansions.

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.760
That's right.

01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:36.751
Please wait here.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:49.878
- I'm sorry.
- It's no problem.

01:33:02.120 --> 01:33:03.839
- Is this it?
- Yes.

01:33:06.800 --> 01:33:08.280
What is this place?

01:33:08.800 --> 01:33:11.872
It used to be a restaurant.

01:33:12.160 --> 01:33:16.200
But the new owner lives abroad,
so it's almost always empty.

01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:20.632
So, in the end, no one uses it.

01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:26.035
All you have to do is live here.

01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.994
That's the job.

01:33:29.080 --> 01:33:31.276
Isn't this too good a deal?

01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:35.038
It's my job to find these good deals.

01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:37.240
Let's go.

01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.793
There should be another
maid living here as well.

01:33:43.960 --> 01:33:45.280
Excuse me!

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:49.840
Is anyone home?

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.355
Let's go inside.

01:33:54.760 --> 01:33:55.760
Okay.

01:33:57.200 --> 01:33:58.200
We're coming in!

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:00.189
Excuse me!

01:34:00.320 --> 01:34:01.595
Pardon me.

01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:12.239
Now this is something.

01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:16.709
This is a little messy.

01:34:17.120 --> 01:34:19.510
This goes miles beyond "a little".

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:21.359
How do you say...

01:34:22.680 --> 01:34:23.750
Moreover...

01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:27.270
I told you household duties...

01:34:27.600 --> 01:34:29.592
...but you can't do this alone.

01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:33.197
This other maid isn't doing her job at all.

01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:38.120
Are these costumes?

01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:41.590
Oh, but there's a bed.

01:34:41.680 --> 01:34:42.750
You're right.

01:34:42.960 --> 01:34:45.520
Check this out.

01:34:46.160 --> 01:34:48.311
Oh no, no thank you.

01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:50.432
This is quite some collection.

01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:52.799
Do you like this sort of stuff?

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:57.071
- I don't think so.
- It's certainly something.

01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:01.312
This mess is incredible.

01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:03.990
Over here.

01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:07.030
Check this out.

01:35:12.320 --> 01:35:13.993
Look at the jellyfish.

01:35:16.400 --> 01:35:19.757
Is feeding these animals
part of the job too?

01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:21.953
That'd be my guess.

01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:24.956
There's lots to do.

01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:26.838
You can say that again.

01:35:33.840 --> 01:35:36.230
Let me know if you need anything.

01:35:36.240 --> 01:35:38.436
Thank you.

01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:41.239
Not to worry. Anything for Ramba Ral.

01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:45.360
Goodbye then!

01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:46.916
Thank you!

01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:48.070
No problem!

01:37:11.400 --> 01:37:12.720
Good morning.

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:15.920
Morning!

01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:20.597
Good morning!

01:37:20.800 --> 01:37:21.950
It's morning!

01:37:22.800 --> 01:37:23.916
It's already morning!

01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:28.509
Wake up!

01:37:28.640 --> 01:37:31.235
It's already 9 in the morning!

01:37:31.400 --> 01:37:32.880
Get up! Get up!

01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:35.072
...what?

01:37:35.080 --> 01:37:36.833
It's 9 o'clock.

01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:40.151
Good morning, sleepy head.

01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:43.034
What are you doing here, Mashiro?

01:37:43.120 --> 01:37:44.270
You say that...

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:47.956
...but I too, am a maid.

01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:53.593
You work here too?

01:37:53.720 --> 01:37:56.440
I've been here 3 months.

01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:57.756
I see.

01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:00.759
Amuro told me you were coming.

01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:02.114
Yes.

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:03.720
I'll show you around.

01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:04.840
Okay.

01:38:05.320 --> 01:38:06.515
This house is huge.

01:38:06.600 --> 01:38:08.910
- Did you look around?
- Just a little.

01:38:11.440 --> 01:38:12.590
What about that room?

01:38:13.080 --> 01:38:13.797
That room?

01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:16.713
- The jellyfish...
- That's right!

01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:18.230
Scary stuff.

01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:21.000
- Now this is the party room.
- Yes.

01:38:21.200 --> 01:38:22.554
That's the kitchen over there.

01:38:23.680 --> 01:38:25.797
Can you imagine the party they had here?

01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:28.520
- And we're cleaning this up?
- That's right.

01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:30.029
It's a hefty mess.

01:38:31.800 --> 01:38:34.360
It's a maid's job to clean up the mess.

01:38:34.440 --> 01:38:35.954
You're my savior!

01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:37.429
- Come over here.
- Yes.

01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:39.956
Over here is a secret spot.

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:41.080
Okay.

01:38:42.200 --> 01:38:44.999
And toodlie twink!

01:38:45.160 --> 01:38:47.959
This is my private living quarters.

01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:50.238
Go ahead and take a seat.

01:38:50.600 --> 01:38:51.590
Thank you.

01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:54.195
And this wonderful thing
also acts as a bed.

01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:56.195
Good night!

01:38:57.080 --> 01:38:57.957
You're sleeping?

01:38:57.960 --> 01:38:58.871
Of course I am.

01:38:58.960 --> 01:39:01.429
I just finished drinking in Ginza.

01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:02.710
In Ginza?

01:39:02.720 --> 01:39:04.040
I can't keep my eyes open.

01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:07.554
Hold on a second.

01:39:08.080 --> 01:39:09.594
Mashiro, I...

01:39:10.360 --> 01:39:13.239
There's a lot of things I want to ask you.

01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:14.829
You know, like...

01:39:17.320 --> 01:39:18.674
Mashiro?

01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:22.757
The jellyfish? I'll take a look.

01:39:23.760 --> 01:39:24.760
Thank you.

01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:25.800
No problem.

01:39:26.320 --> 01:39:28.630
The other maid working here was Mashiro.

01:39:30.280 --> 01:39:31.280
Were you surprised?

01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.713
Of course I was surprised.

01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:35.160
I bet you were.

01:39:35.680 --> 01:39:38.115
She told me not to tell you.

01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:42.151
I'm glad it's her, though.

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:44.040
Is that so?

01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:49.640
On TV shows, senior maids are
always kind of frightening.

01:39:51.640 --> 01:39:53.120
Mashiro is just as frightening.

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.235
No, she's not.

01:39:55.440 --> 01:39:56.920
Are you sure you're alright?

01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:58.994
I'm fine.

01:40:54.080 --> 01:40:55.080
Hello.

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:56.714
My name is Nameri.

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:00.516
I was contacted by Amuro...

01:41:05.040 --> 01:41:06.440
For the jellyfish upstairs?

01:41:08.160 --> 01:41:08.991
Right!

01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:10.230
Please come in.

01:41:10.240 --> 01:41:11.594
Thank you.

01:41:11.760 --> 01:41:12.876
Pardon me.

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:21.117
Taking care of the water
is first and foremost.

01:41:21.600 --> 01:41:23.910
So please be careful about that.

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:27.079
This one here is a stingray.

01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:28.794
- A stingray.
- Yes.

01:41:29.560 --> 01:41:31.153
You can eat the fins, right?

01:41:31.160 --> 01:41:34.039
Yes, that's right.

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:37.951
This here is a cone snail.

01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:40.590
A cone snail... Is it edible?

01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:43.077
No, it's not edible.

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:45.160
What is that one?

01:41:45.800 --> 01:41:46.800
A scorpion.

01:41:47.120 --> 01:41:48.156
- Scorpion?
- Yes.

01:41:49.800 --> 01:41:50.995
It moved!

01:41:52.080 --> 01:41:54.834
All of these animals are poisonous...

01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:56.354
...so please don't touch them.

01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:02.316
Morning!

01:42:02.520 --> 01:42:03.920
Good morning.

01:42:04.120 --> 01:42:07.511
- You really cleaned the place!
- Still lots to do though.

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.830
This is wonderful, great job!

01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:13.270
Aren't you the hard worker!

01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:14.920
Thanks.

01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:16.878
I'm so hung over.

01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:20.069
I drank too much last night.

01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:24.600
I'm starving!

01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.873
What are you eating?

01:42:28.280 --> 01:42:30.078
A sandwich for dinner.

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:31.749
Is that from the store?

01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:32.637
Yes.

01:42:32.640 --> 01:42:36.031
Eat from the fridge, please!

01:42:36.320 --> 01:42:38.789
Eat from the fridge!

01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:41.071
Eat and then replenish the fridge!

01:42:41.440 --> 01:42:45.036
Doesn't an empty fridge
make you feel anxious?

01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:46.640
Do you like ham?

01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:48.953
- I do.
- Great.

01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:50.560
Tada!

01:42:52.360 --> 01:42:53.680
This is a wild meal.

01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:55.075
You could say that.

01:42:56.680 --> 01:42:58.000
Do you like eggs?

01:42:58.800 --> 01:42:59.800
Yes.

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:03.796
The owner of this house...

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:10.993
Are they hiring us to look
after those pets upstairs?

01:43:11.560 --> 01:43:12.914
I don't know.

01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:16.916
You know actually, they might be
hiding in the attic...

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:20.039
...peeping in on us.

01:43:21.080 --> 01:43:22.196
Seriously?

01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.794
What's the matter?

01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.229
Mashiro?

01:44:11.520 --> 01:44:12.920
Come on in.

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:28.200
I have to get some sleep.

01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:30.357
Shibuya at 7 o'clock.

01:44:30.680 --> 01:44:33.240
- For work?
- I have a shoot.

01:44:33.680 --> 01:44:34.955
A shoot?

01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:46.758
Right, you're an actress.

01:44:48.880 --> 01:44:50.155
Should I wake you?

01:44:50.160 --> 01:44:52.231
I'll be okay.

01:44:53.000 --> 01:44:54.719
Did you set an alarm?

01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:56.074
Nope.

01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:57.435
What time are you getting up?

01:44:57.960 --> 01:44:58.960
5 o'clock!

01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:02.358
That's in 3 hours.

01:45:34.200 --> 01:45:35.200
Hello, there!

01:45:35.240 --> 01:45:36.230
Good afternoon.

01:45:36.240 --> 01:45:37.240
Hi there.

01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:38.710
Hello.

01:45:39.680 --> 01:45:40.909
What can I do for you?

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:47.553
The owner contacted me
about a package arriving?

01:45:48.160 --> 01:45:49.276
- A package?
- Yes.

01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:52.270
There was a package that came for Mashiro.

01:45:52.440 --> 01:45:53.999
- I'll take that.
- Thank you.

01:45:54.440 --> 01:45:55.191
That's the one.

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.549
- Is it?
- Yes.

01:45:56.760 --> 01:45:59.116
I put it in the fridge.

01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:01.912
Did you say refrigerator?

01:46:02.440 --> 01:46:03.191
Yes.

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:04.953
That is... um...

01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:08.080
You put the package
straight into the fridge?

01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:10.715
Yes, it looked like it
should be refrigerated.

01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:13.037
That is um... I'll fix it...

01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:15.155
It looks okay.

01:46:15.320 --> 01:46:17.232
Really? I'm sorry.

01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:20.280
What is this?

01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:22.879
Isn't it a new pet?

01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:24.599
What is it this time?

01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:25.870
I don't have a clue.

01:46:27.360 --> 01:46:29.238
This here is...

01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:34.631
An octopus.

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:35.680
It's so tiny!

01:46:35.720 --> 01:46:36.720
An octopus?

01:46:36.880 --> 01:46:38.200
Is this poisonous too?

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:39.599
Of course.

01:46:39.600 --> 01:46:41.193
It's called a blue-ringed octopus.

01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:43.320
- A blue-ringed octopus.
- Yes.

01:46:47.000 --> 01:46:49.151
It has the same poison as a puffer fish.

01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:51.960
You're safe if you don't eat puffer fish...

01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:54.240
...but this critter bites.

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:56.839
So be sure not to touch it.

01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:58.190
I understand.

01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:03.195
I brought a little present for you, Nanami.

01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:05.200
Oh, I'm fine, thanks.

01:47:05.560 --> 01:47:07.552
There's nothing to worry about.

01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:09.314
This one isn't poisonous.

01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:11.120
It's called a "Betta"...

01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.280
It's pretty.

01:47:16.560 --> 01:47:17.720
They're easy to take care of.

01:47:18.240 --> 01:47:19.240
Okay.

01:47:21.360 --> 01:47:23.397
Give me a ring if you need anything.

01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:25.713
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

01:47:25.840 --> 01:47:27.320
And for the fish too.

01:47:27.520 --> 01:47:28.520
Please take care of them.

01:47:28.720 --> 01:47:30.393
Goodbye, then.

01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:39.840
Have you gotten used to living here?

01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:45.553
I'm still adjusting.

01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:47.430
I understand.

01:47:48.960 --> 01:47:51.350
But that looks suits you.

01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:54.874
You're making me blush.

01:47:55.040 --> 01:47:56.110
Really, it looks good.

01:47:57.880 --> 01:47:59.872
The place is worth cleaning.

01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.000
Really?

01:48:02.520 --> 01:48:04.000
Would you like more tea?

01:48:04.080 --> 01:48:05.150
Thank you.

01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.800
I'll be right back.

01:48:09.640 --> 01:48:10.640
Thank you.

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:12.830
Hey, listen...

01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:15.560
Yes?

01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:18.757
Do you like living with Mashiro?

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:22.190
It's a lot of fun.

01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:03.154
Where are you now?

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.231
I'm at a friend's house.

01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:12.272
Did you run away?

01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:16.757
Not exactly.

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:21.352
Don't worry yourself.

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:24.557
Back to your work.

01:49:27.160 --> 01:49:28.753
I'm back!

01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:31.153
I'm home!

01:49:31.240 --> 01:49:32.390
Welcome home.

01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:33.520
Did I wake you?

01:49:33.560 --> 01:49:36.120
You were sleeping and I woke you.

01:49:36.640 --> 01:49:38.711
Am I an annoying woman?

01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:40.230
Are you angry?

01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:42.273
You always come home late.

01:49:43.440 --> 01:49:44.590
You're adorable.

01:49:46.160 --> 01:49:47.640
Were you working?

01:49:47.800 --> 01:49:49.359
Working hard.

01:49:49.440 --> 01:49:50.715
I feel for you.

01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:52.712
I know, I'm so worn out.

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:54.076
So tired.

01:49:56.520 --> 01:49:58.591
Tough toughy job.

01:49:58.760 --> 01:50:00.558
An octopus arrived today.

01:50:00.840 --> 01:50:01.956
Some strange octopus.

01:50:02.360 --> 01:50:04.829
An octopus?

01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:12.315
It's poisonous and lethal
so don't touch it.

01:50:13.200 --> 01:50:15.351
That only makes you want to touch it.

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.839
You shouldn't.

01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:21.551
Hey there you...

01:51:10.160 --> 01:51:10.877
See?

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:12.354
You're in my way.

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:15.795
It's so cold!

01:51:16.640 --> 01:51:20.156
Ok, now, out of the way.

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:22.600
Okay!

01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:31.274
Isn't that enough?

01:51:32.200 --> 01:51:34.078
I bet you're hungry.

01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:36.759
I'm worn out.

01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:43.669
Let's finish there.

01:51:44.800 --> 01:51:45.800
Over there?

01:51:46.120 --> 01:51:47.349
With our bikes?

01:51:50.920 --> 01:51:53.833
Wait! Wait for me!

01:51:55.040 --> 01:51:58.670
And I'm going home! Oh, I'm heading home!

01:51:58.920 --> 01:52:02.994
Rolling, polling, rolling! Bye! Bye! Bye!

01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:05.318
Come on, you can do it!

01:52:05.320 --> 01:52:06.720
It's going out!

01:52:21.280 --> 01:52:22.350
Ma...

01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:25.035
. shi
LL LLL

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:27.035
. ro!
LL

01:52:31.160 --> 01:52:33.436
Write my name.

01:52:46.400 --> 01:52:47.436
What's this?

01:52:48.360 --> 01:52:52.195
Why are you sleeping here?

01:52:54.960 --> 01:52:57.077
Is it your day off?

01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.360
I'm sorry to bother you.

01:53:10.760 --> 01:53:12.240
We've got more jellyfish now.

01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:17.631
We don't have any more room.

01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:23.560
Mashiro?

01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:28.359
Mashiro, you've got a call.

01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:34.236
Someone called Tsuneyoshi
is trying to call you.

01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:40.270
Mashiro? What are you doing?

01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:43.515
Can you hear me?

01:53:44.600 --> 01:53:46.114
Where are you? Hello?

01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:48.520
Hello.

01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:50.797
Mashiro is sleeping.

01:53:51.120 --> 01:53:52.713
Should I wake her up?

01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:54.400
Who are you?

01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:59.032
I live with her.

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:00.272
I see.

01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:02.073
Wake her up right now.

01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:03.600
The shoot has already started.

01:54:05.520 --> 01:54:07.432
Please wake up Mashiro.

01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:09.030
Mashiro?

01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:13.796
Do you have a cold?

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:15.400
Should I take your temperature?

01:54:15.880 --> 01:54:18.111
What's happening? What's wrong?

01:54:19.400 --> 01:54:23.519
Mashiro has a fever
and I don't think she can move.

01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:25.315
What should I do?

01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:27.831
I'm heading over right now.

01:54:29.000 --> 01:54:30.195
Okay.

01:54:31.120 --> 01:54:32.270
Mashiro...

01:54:33.120 --> 01:54:34.190
Are you alright?

01:54:40.040 --> 01:54:41.759
- Where is she?
- Over here.

01:54:44.920 --> 01:54:45.990
I'm really sorry.

01:54:49.640 --> 01:54:50.312
Where?

01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:51.800
On the sofa over there.

01:54:52.000 --> 01:54:53.000
There she is L

01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:55.556
Are you alright?

01:54:57.000 --> 01:54:58.000
Hey!

01:54:59.320 --> 01:55:00.436
She's got a fever.

01:55:01.400 --> 01:55:02.754
Is there a hospital nearby?

01:55:03.160 --> 01:55:04.753
I think so.

01:55:04.880 --> 01:55:06.360
- Really?
- I'll take a look.

01:55:06.680 --> 01:55:07.796
Never mind.

01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:10.719
I'll take her to a place
I know in Yokohama.

01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:11.840
Okay.

01:55:12.080 --> 01:55:13.992
Now, how should we get her up?

01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:16.194
Two women...

01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:18.116
Come here a second.

01:55:18.360 --> 01:55:19.360
Okay.

01:55:19.520 --> 01:55:20.520
Like this?

01:55:22.320 --> 01:55:23.310
How should we do this?

01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:24.310
This?

01:55:24.320 --> 01:55:25.754
Will that work?

01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.514
Then this?

01:55:28.440 --> 01:55:29.590
What do you think?

01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:31.554
Can I try carrying you?

01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:32.357
Really?

01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:33.316
Can we try it?

01:55:33.320 --> 01:55:34.799
You're so thin. Are you sure?

01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:35.836
Go ahead.

01:55:35.840 --> 01:55:37.194
Here I go! Watch out!

01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:38.200
No problem.

01:55:38.680 --> 01:55:39.352
Here we go!

01:55:39.360 --> 01:55:40.555
Shit! Scary!

01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:42.396
- This works.
- Yes.

01:55:42.400 --> 01:55:43.754
Lets go with this.

01:55:47.720 --> 01:55:49.313
- Do you have her?
- Yes.

01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:51.909
And here we go! Are you okay?

01:55:52.640 --> 01:55:54.632
- She's not too heavy?
- I'm okay.

01:55:56.240 --> 01:55:57.833
What's wrong? Is she too heavy?

01:55:58.560 --> 01:55:59.596
She's light.

01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:01.875
So I'm the heavy one?

01:56:02.200 --> 01:56:03.200
No, um...

01:56:05.440 --> 01:56:07.636
I think she's too light.

01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:12.069
Let's head to the hospital.

01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:29.590
Where are we going?

01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:31.120
The hospital.

01:56:31.680 --> 01:56:32.680
Hospital?

01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:34.797
No, I have to go to work.

01:56:35.080 --> 01:56:37.436
I already told them you're not coming.

01:56:38.360 --> 01:56:39.760
I'm not going to the hospital!

01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:41.879
Drive me to the set!

01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:44.038
I already cancelled!

01:56:44.160 --> 01:56:45.310
Stop the car!

01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:46.794
I'm getting off!

01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:48.280
Let me out!

01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:49.919
Where do you think you're going?

01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:51.754
I have to go to work.

01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:53.919
Stop it! It's dangerous!

01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:55.913
I'll feel better if I work!

01:56:55.920 --> 01:56:57.070
You won't!

01:56:57.360 --> 01:56:58.396
Let me out!

01:56:58.400 --> 01:56:59.400
Calm down!

01:56:59.600 --> 01:57:01.353
I need to go to work!

01:57:01.600 --> 01:57:03.319
Let me out!

01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:06.151
I need to work.

01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:07.833
Where are you going?

01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:18.752
I need to go to work!

01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:20.719
Fine, I get it.

01:57:20.720 --> 01:57:22.677
You're going to set, okay?

01:57:24.760 --> 01:57:26.160
I'm going...

01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:29.160
Okay, let's go.

01:57:30.160 --> 01:57:31.389
Stand up.

01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:34.356
Good morning.

01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:35.360
Are you alright?

01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:37.159
I'm fine, I'm sorry.

01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:38.230
Don't worry about it.

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:40.557
- We'll bring her to make-up.
- Thank you.

01:57:41.800 --> 01:57:43.075
Has she been eating?

01:57:45.160 --> 01:57:46.160
I think so.

01:57:46.760 --> 01:57:47.760
Properly?

01:57:48.600 --> 01:57:49.600
I'm sure.

01:57:49.880 --> 01:57:52.759
There's nothing unusual about her diet.

01:57:55.240 --> 01:57:57.994
She's lost a lot of weight recently.

01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:01.279
I wonder what's going on.

01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:02.600
Maybe something's wrong with her.

01:58:03.000 --> 01:58:04.080
You haven't heard anything?

01:58:04.600 --> 01:58:06.398
No, I haven't.

01:58:07.280 --> 01:58:10.830
If she gets too thin,
she'll end up losing work.

01:58:12.040 --> 01:58:14.191
Porn stars are better with curves.

01:58:14.360 --> 01:58:17.432
...porn stars?

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:20.879
Maybe it's a fit over some guy...

01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:22.596
I don't have a clue.

01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:27.755
That feels better.

01:58:29.280 --> 01:58:30.316
Thanks for your help.

01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:31.390
It's fine.

01:58:35.080 --> 01:58:38.551
Do you know what this place used to be?

01:58:40.640 --> 01:58:43.314
I heard it used to be a restaurant.

01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:46.199
But now it's a shooting studio.

01:58:46.840 --> 01:58:48.035
A shooting studio?

01:58:48.400 --> 01:58:49.400
Yup.

01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:52.112
And now Mashiro lives here.

01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:57.240
We did on a shoot here, maybe 6 months ago.

01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:01.756
She fell in love with this place...

01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:03.954
...so she's renting this place out.

01:59:05.520 --> 01:59:07.591
But rent isn't cheap.

01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:10.000
She'll go bankrupt
if she keeps going like this.

01:59:12.920 --> 01:59:15.151
So Mashiro lives here?

01:59:15.160 --> 01:59:16.196
You know she does.

01:59:17.040 --> 01:59:18.599
She's paying rent?

01:59:18.680 --> 01:59:21.240
Yeah, and it's crazy expensive.

01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:24.273
Talk to her will you?

01:59:24.600 --> 01:59:26.353
Tell her to find a cheaper place.

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:29.952
But I know she won't listen.

01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.320
I'll be off then.

01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:34.994
Thanks for your help.

01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:37.751
Don't tell Mashiro what I said.

01:59:39.920 --> 01:59:40.956
See you later!

01:59:41.240 --> 01:59:42.640
Thank you very much.

02:00:01.000 --> 02:00:02.992
First comes rock...

02:00:03.240 --> 02:00:05.277
Paper, Scissors... Shoot!

02:00:05.640 --> 02:00:07.233
Who are the winners?

02:00:10.280 --> 02:00:12.033
Hold on.

02:00:13.200 --> 02:00:14.600
I've got a phone call.

02:00:14.760 --> 02:00:15.830
Who is it?

02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.434
Hello?

02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:23.269
Hello?

02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:26.197
What's going on?

02:00:26.680 --> 02:00:28.080
I'm listening.

02:00:30.600 --> 02:00:35.038
Is Mashiro a porn star?

02:00:35.840 --> 02:00:37.752
Didn't she tell you?

02:00:40.760 --> 02:00:42.592
She is an actress, in a way.

02:00:42.920 --> 02:00:44.400
What about it?

02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:47.519
- Um...
- Yes?

02:00:52.680 --> 02:00:56.674
Is Mashiro the one who is hiring me?

02:00:59.200 --> 02:01:02.432
I can't give out that sort of information.

02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:04.999
Please, tell me.

02:01:05.600 --> 02:01:07.080
I can't.

02:01:07.280 --> 02:01:08.873
It'd be a breach of contract.

02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:12.360
I see...

02:01:14.680 --> 02:01:16.080
I'm sorry...

02:01:16.560 --> 02:01:18.597
...to burden you.

02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:20.240
Please don't hang up.

02:01:21.520 --> 02:01:22.795
Please give me one second.

02:01:22.800 --> 02:01:24.029
Give me a hand!

02:01:24.840 --> 02:01:26.160
I'm sorry.

02:01:26.960 --> 02:01:28.758
Thank you.

02:01:29.640 --> 02:01:31.359
No, no wait.

02:01:34.280 --> 02:01:38.638
I don't want you to mention
these things to Mashiro.

02:01:44.040 --> 02:01:47.317
Neither what I'm about to tell you.

02:01:49.240 --> 02:01:50.390
Okay.

02:01:52.320 --> 02:01:53.834
I want a friend...

02:01:54.520 --> 02:01:58.719
...that was my client's request.

02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:02.510
A... friend?

02:02:04.360 --> 02:02:07.319
So that's my job?

02:02:08.240 --> 02:02:10.675
If I told you this, it'd
be quite unnerving.

02:02:11.360 --> 02:02:13.875
That's why I brought it up as a maid job.

02:02:14.760 --> 02:02:16.717
Why me?

02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:22.151
Because I chose you, Nanami.

02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:25.075
But why?

02:02:26.680 --> 02:02:28.990
Because I needed the money?

02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:31.917
Because I thought you would be her friend.

02:02:32.880 --> 02:02:37.113
Because... I trusted you would.

02:02:39.600 --> 02:02:40.600
Well...

02:02:41.760 --> 02:02:43.752
If you look beyond her profession...

02:02:45.000 --> 02:02:46.753
...if you don't dwell on her past...

02:02:47.240 --> 02:02:48.674
...everything will be fine.

02:02:50.760 --> 02:02:52.797
So if you can stay with her...

02:02:53.960 --> 02:02:55.189
I'll be right there.

02:02:56.160 --> 02:02:59.039
I leave it to your imagination,
who this client is.

02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:05.669
I have to go now, so I
will talk to you later.

02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:19.990
- Are you ok?
- Yes.

02:03:21.400 --> 02:03:23.631
A doctor came to set today...

02:03:23.960 --> 02:03:26.111
...and she was given an IV.

02:03:28.880 --> 02:03:30.280
There you go now.

02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:32.360
You did a good job today.

02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:34.274
Great threesome!

02:03:34.680 --> 02:03:36.399
- She did?
- Yes, she did.

02:03:36.680 --> 02:03:38.239
She did really well.

02:03:38.680 --> 02:03:40.717
You had a threesome?

02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.116
That's great.

02:03:42.120 --> 02:03:43.634
She did great.

02:03:45.280 --> 02:03:46.999
I'm making her rest a while.

02:03:48.800 --> 02:03:51.076
So look after her for me.

02:03:52.560 --> 02:03:53.560
I will.

02:03:54.600 --> 02:03:55.600
Here's some medicine.

02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:00.040
I'm leaving, Mashiro.

02:04:04.040 --> 02:04:05.040
She's all yours.

02:04:05.160 --> 02:04:06.160
Okay.

02:04:13.080 --> 02:04:14.639
Thank you very much.

02:04:24.640 --> 02:04:25.790
Mashiro?

02:04:27.760 --> 02:04:29.240
Can you get up?

02:05:06.400 --> 02:05:08.312
What are you eating?

02:05:12.960 --> 02:05:15.236
What is this medicine for?

02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:28.112
You shouldn't be drinking.

02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:32.673
Can't you sleep?

02:05:34.520 --> 02:05:37.672
No matter how much I drink,
I don't feel anything.

02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:43.399
You shouldn't.

02:06:06.280 --> 02:06:07.760
No.

02:06:11.280 --> 02:06:12.236
No, no, no.

02:06:12.280 --> 02:06:12.918
What?

02:06:13.000 --> 02:06:14.320
No, no try listening.

02:06:14.640 --> 02:06:15.710
Listen to it.

02:06:17.360 --> 02:06:18.589
What am I listening to?

02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:20.554
Don't you hear something?

02:06:21.120 --> 02:06:22.395
Hear something?

02:06:31.880 --> 02:06:34.076
You're right, I do.

02:06:35.360 --> 02:06:36.953
It's a pretty sound.

02:06:38.440 --> 02:06:40.318
It's like you're under the ocean.

02:06:42.800 --> 02:06:43.995
You're right.

02:06:54.040 --> 02:06:56.350
Now it's a low sound.

02:06:58.720 --> 02:07:00.757
We're at the bottom of the ocean.

02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:36.954
Mashiro...

02:07:41.680 --> 02:07:42.909
I
LLL

02:07:46.880 --> 02:07:49.111
I'm going to quit this job.

02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:55.115
So please...

02:07:57.080 --> 02:08:03.236
...don't waste your money
on this house, or on me.

02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:09.520
I want you to...

02:08:13.320 --> 02:08:16.040
...take better care of yourself.

02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:38.040
It's delicious.

02:08:40.680 --> 02:08:42.194
I'm so sorry.

02:08:42.840 --> 02:08:44.399
What are you apologizing for?

02:09:09.640 --> 02:09:13.031
I could give anything for these tears.

02:09:14.360 --> 02:09:16.397
I could even give my life.

02:09:33.880 --> 02:09:35.792
Mashiro...

02:09:38.560 --> 02:09:40.438
Why don't we move away?

02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:44.880
Instead of a mansion like this...

02:09:46.840 --> 02:09:52.234
...a room for the two of us...

02:09:53.000 --> 02:09:55.993
Together... just us.

02:09:56.800 --> 02:09:58.120
Even if we're poor...

02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:01.992
...together with you...

02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:05.680
...the two of us.

02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:12.715
That's not bad.

02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:15.235
Let's do it L

02:10:15.640 --> 02:10:16.710
Okay.

02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:23.920
It's right next to the station.

02:10:24.440 --> 02:10:26.318
It takes maybe a minute...

02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:28.911
...100 meters away.

02:10:30.520 --> 02:10:31.715
It's this room here.

02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:33.280
Good afternoon.

02:10:39.840 --> 02:10:43.880
The inside is much newer than
the outside suggests.

02:10:46.040 --> 02:10:49.238
Do you have anything with a better view?

02:10:50.160 --> 02:10:51.719
A room with a view?

02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:53.280
I can show you some.

02:10:54.440 --> 02:10:57.114
This one's big.

02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:58.200
Is it?

02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:02.720
I like it.

02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:04.877
This is one of the biggest...

02:11:05.280 --> 02:11:07.839
Opening the two rooms like this...

02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:12.437
...it becomes around 50
square meters of space.

02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:14.200
That sounds good for me.

02:11:14.560 --> 02:11:16.199
How much is it?

02:11:16.720 --> 02:11:20.600
The rent here is...

02:11:21.880 --> 02:11:22.996
...$a4,000/month.

02:11:24.760 --> 02:11:26.558
It's too expensive.

02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:28.796
Let's live here.

02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:31.955
Let's live right here.

02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.879
Was the other apartment too small?

02:11:39.160 --> 02:11:41.629
The other one was nice too...

02:11:42.600 --> 02:11:44.000
Let's just live here.

02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:47.234
Come on.

02:11:47.880 --> 02:11:50.554
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

02:11:50.920 --> 02:11:52.195
Have a safe trip.

02:11:54.160 --> 02:11:55.160
Bye!

02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:03.800
What is it?

02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:27.274
It's full of dresses.

02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:30.590
Welcome.

02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:32.679
Do you have a reservation?

02:12:32.680 --> 02:12:33.318
No, we don't.

02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:34.151
Let's go.

02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:35.793
- Are you just looking?
- Yes.

02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:37.399
Please, come in.

02:12:37.520 --> 02:12:38.840
- We're going in?
- Come on.

02:12:38.920 --> 02:12:40.115
Excuse me.

02:12:42.800 --> 02:12:44.757
Please don't buy anything.

02:12:44.960 --> 02:12:45.996
Why not?

02:12:47.000 --> 02:12:48.878
You're considering it?

02:12:50.360 --> 02:12:51.679
This isn't funny.

02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:53.034
But these are so cute.

02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:55.633
How's this for lounge wear?

02:12:56.920 --> 02:12:58.319
For lounge wear?

02:12:58.320 --> 02:12:59.320
You heard me.

02:12:59.560 --> 02:13:02.359
- I think it'd work perfectly.
- Isn't it too flashy?

02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:03.999
Oh, this is casual.

02:13:04.800 --> 02:13:06.234
Would you like to try?

02:13:07.040 --> 02:13:08.599
- Can we?
- Of course.

02:13:09.360 --> 02:13:10.430
And for you too.

02:13:10.600 --> 02:13:12.239
Oh, I'm okay.

02:13:12.400 --> 02:13:13.400
Please, try it on.

02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:15.160
Let's do it!

02:13:15.400 --> 02:13:16.754
You'd look great.

02:13:17.840 --> 02:13:18.840
Hey Nanami!

02:13:19.880 --> 02:13:21.951
You look great!

02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:23.514
You too L

02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:25.115
You look adorable.

02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:26.800
It's not too tight?

02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:27.910
I'm okay.

02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:29.190
What about you?

02:13:29.800 --> 02:13:31.120
I'm alright.

02:13:32.200 --> 02:13:33.280
Remember, it's casual wear.

02:13:38.880 --> 02:13:40.678
You look beautiful.

02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:42.911
- Will you look at this?
- How pretty.

02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:48.319
We also provide a photo shoot
if you're interested.

02:13:48.440 --> 02:13:49.874
- A photo shoot?
- Yes.

02:13:50.160 --> 02:13:53.232
Some people come here just to take photos.

02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:54.517
Do you want to try?

02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:56.000
They come and wear the dress...

02:13:56.080 --> 02:13:57.753
...and take pictures by themselves.

02:13:59.520 --> 02:14:00.636
Interesting.

02:14:00.960 --> 02:14:03.600
- Lets do it L - No,
we should get home.

02:14:03.720 --> 02:14:04.790
Why?

02:14:05.720 --> 02:14:06.915
Let's get closer.

02:14:07.080 --> 02:14:07.957
That's great!

02:14:07.960 --> 02:14:09.360
Look over here now.

02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:11.160
Good!

02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:12.111
This is embarrassing.

02:14:12.200 --> 02:14:14.396
I bet you work in this industry.

02:14:15.200 --> 02:14:16.429
A model, perhaps?

02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:19.799
I know I've seen you before.

02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:23.635
Why don't you try putting
your faces together?

02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:25.353
Look far away.

02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:27.196
Beautiful.

02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:29.120
These are great shots.

02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:31.560
Look right here.

02:14:32.360 --> 02:14:33.396
This is too embarrassing!

02:14:33.840 --> 02:14:35.991
- Come on in.
- I'll open the door.

02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:39.160
Come on in.

02:14:43.880 --> 02:14:44.880
Thank you.

02:14:51.400 --> 02:14:52.800
Look at each other.

02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:18.916
- I got some great shots.
- Thank you.

02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:20.269
I'll send them to you.

02:16:21.560 --> 02:16:22.560
Be careful now.

02:16:22.720 --> 02:16:23.870
Here's your seatbelt.

02:16:25.720 --> 02:16:26.720
Watch the door.

02:16:29.840 --> 02:16:30.910
Careful now.

02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:34.716
Thank you very much.

02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:36.360
Be careful now.

02:16:36.400 --> 02:16:37.400
Thank you.

02:16:53.600 --> 02:16:55.114
The breeze...

02:16:56.040 --> 02:16:57.156
...it feels great.

02:20:15.560 --> 02:20:17.153
Should we really get married?

02:20:17.640 --> 02:20:20.678
That might not be a bad idea.

02:20:21.600 --> 02:20:22.920
Then let's get married.

02:20:23.080 --> 02:20:24.080
Okay.

02:20:25.000 --> 02:20:26.000
Are you sure?

02:20:26.520 --> 02:20:27.520
I am.

02:20:28.360 --> 02:20:29.589
Have you been drinking?

02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:31.997
Yes, I have!

02:20:51.400 --> 02:20:52.675
You know...

02:20:54.600 --> 02:20:57.672
...whenever I go shopping...

02:21:00.960 --> 02:21:06.399
...the person at the counter...

02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:13.160
...puts my groceries into bags.

02:21:23.960 --> 02:21:25.917
For a nobody like me...

02:21:28.000 --> 02:21:30.799
...their hands, they're working so hard.

02:21:33.640 --> 02:21:35.757
And it's just for me.

02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:42.119
Those hands are stuffing my food
and snacks into bags.

02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:46.832
When I see that...

02:21:48.240 --> 02:21:50.835
I feel my chest tightening.

02:21:51.960 --> 02:21:53.838
It makes me want to cry.

02:21:58.040 --> 02:22:00.316
What are you talking about?

02:22:02.440 --> 02:22:06.559
Happiness has a limit for me.

02:22:07.920 --> 02:22:10.799
A limit where I can't take any more.

02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:16.553
This limit comes to me
much quicker than other people.

02:22:17.160 --> 02:22:20.790
It comes even quicker than a tiny ant's.

02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:26.320
Because you know...

02:22:29.880 --> 02:22:31.712
...this world we live in...

02:22:33.840 --> 02:22:36.514
...it's actually full of happiness.

02:22:38.880 --> 02:22:41.520
Everyone is too kind.

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:49.120
The mailman brings up a heavy package...

02:22:49.800 --> 02:22:52.235
...just because I ask him to.

02:22:54.680 --> 02:22:59.311
Someone gave me an umbrella,
once on a rainy day.

02:23:02.200 --> 02:23:03.395
But then...

02:23:04.720 --> 02:23:09.636
All this happiness at
once, I can't stand it.

02:23:12.400 --> 02:23:17.953
It's much easier just to pay for it.

02:23:19.160 --> 02:23:23.598
That has to be why money exists.

02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:31.431
People's sincerity and kindness...

02:23:32.600 --> 02:23:36.230
...if this all came out clear as day...

02:23:37.760 --> 02:23:42.073
...everyone would just be so thankful.

02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:44.919
They'd be crushed by happiness.

02:23:46.960 --> 02:23:52.319
That's why you exchange it for money...

02:23:53.560 --> 02:23:56.075
...and pretend not to see it.

02:24:00.600 --> 02:24:01.750
Kindness...

02:24:04.400 --> 02:24:05.993
...it's everywhere.

02:24:07.360 --> 02:24:09.272
Everywhere in this world.

02:24:12.120 --> 02:24:17.593
That's why I buy it, with money.

02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:22.119
I buy it.

02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:25.752
Because I can't stand it anymore.

02:24:32.560 --> 02:24:35.075
Please don't look at me like that.

02:24:37.160 --> 02:24:38.753
I'll break apart.

02:24:57.840 --> 02:24:59.957
What if I asked you to die with me?

02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:03.154
Would you?

02:25:06.080 --> 02:25:07.196
What?

02:25:09.440 --> 02:25:11.238
Will you die with me?

02:25:15.520 --> 02:25:16.556
I will.

02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:18.995
You really would?

02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:23.080
Yes L

02:25:26.200 --> 02:25:27.873
You fool.

02:25:37.720 --> 02:25:38.870
You fool...

02:25:41.600 --> 02:25:42.600
Fool...

02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:49.435
Thank you.

02:25:51.600 --> 02:25:52.954
No, thank you.

02:25:54.000 --> 02:25:55.354
I love you.

02:25:58.120 --> 02:25:59.315
Me too.

02:25:59.440 --> 02:26:00.920
I love you.

02:26:33.120 --> 02:26:34.395
Can I help you?

02:26:36.040 --> 02:26:39.431
I'm Tsutsumi from the Arusu Funeral Home.

02:26:41.680 --> 02:26:44.400
I was contacted by Rip Van Winkle.

02:26:45.520 --> 02:26:47.876
Now what about the keys...

02:26:48.560 --> 02:26:50.950
- It seems it's already open.
- I see.

02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:53.720
Shall we go then?

02:27:09.960 --> 02:27:11.110
Pardon me.

02:27:12.720 --> 02:27:14.518
Will you look at that.

02:27:15.160 --> 02:27:17.072
Which one is Rip Van Winkle?

02:27:17.240 --> 02:27:18.240
What?

02:27:18.800 --> 02:27:20.200
Which one is Rip Van Winkle?

02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:22.274
This one here.

02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:25.189
She's cold.

02:27:25.280 --> 02:27:27.192
- You shouldn't touch her.
- I'm sorry.

02:27:28.360 --> 02:27:31.398
She had terminal cancer.

02:27:33.880 --> 02:27:35.792
She didn't have long to live.

02:27:38.600 --> 02:27:40.353
She was scared to die alone.

02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:44.593
She wanted someone to die with.

02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:54.440
It's hard to believe that
this other woman agreed.

02:27:54.880 --> 02:27:57.190
I don't think she knew about it.

02:27:57.880 --> 02:27:59.234
She didn't have a clue.

02:28:00.360 --> 02:28:01.794
It was probably poison.

02:28:11.560 --> 02:28:12.755
This is it.

02:28:13.320 --> 02:28:15.312
- What is it?
- It's a shellfish.

02:28:16.000 --> 02:28:17.150
I forget its name.

02:28:18.640 --> 02:28:20.791
A cone snail.

02:28:21.280 --> 02:28:23.954
To think that this can kill you...

02:28:26.760 --> 02:28:29.116
When you do this...

02:28:30.400 --> 02:28:35.555
How much do you make
for bringing a person like her?

02:28:35.960 --> 02:28:36.960
Why?

02:28:37.280 --> 02:28:38.600
Don't worry about it.

02:28:39.080 --> 02:28:42.152
It's not a matter of money.

02:28:42.640 --> 02:28:48.272
I just wondered how much
you get out of this.

02:28:48.600 --> 02:28:50.193
You ask how much...

02:28:52.120 --> 02:28:53.120
It's $100,000.

02:28:53.320 --> 02:28:54.549
- Huh?
- $100,000.

02:28:54.640 --> 02:28:56.074
Seriously, $100,000?

02:28:56.240 --> 02:28:59.199
Then surely this is a matter of money!

02:28:59.840 --> 02:29:00.840
Not at all.

02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:16.557
Good morning.

02:29:16.720 --> 02:29:19.997
Are you feeling alright?

02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:22.115
Is something wrong?

02:29:24.080 --> 02:29:25.434
Do you feel alright?

02:29:28.520 --> 02:29:29.795
Why do you ask?

02:29:34.440 --> 02:29:37.035
Hello, my name is Tsutsumi.

02:29:37.520 --> 02:29:40.274
I was contacted by Rip Van Winkle.

02:29:41.040 --> 02:29:42.076
I'm an undertaker.

02:29:47.560 --> 02:29:48.835
Mashiro sent us this.

02:29:51.560 --> 02:29:54.280
"I'm going to die tonight.
Take care of the rest."

02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:57.752
I was worried so I came by...

02:29:59.800 --> 02:30:01.712
...and we found Mashiro dead.

02:30:02.240 --> 02:30:05.153
We haven't confirmed her death yet.

02:30:06.600 --> 02:30:08.671
Mashiro is right here.

02:30:08.920 --> 02:30:10.354
Wait! Don't touch her!

02:30:10.920 --> 02:30:12.400
Keep your hands off her!

02:30:13.000 --> 02:30:14.000
Wait! Wait!

02:30:14.360 --> 02:30:16.317
Come over here.

02:30:16.360 --> 02:30:17.589
Mashiro?

02:30:18.640 --> 02:30:19.960
Mashiro!

02:30:23.280 --> 02:30:25.351
I think we should call the police.

02:30:25.560 --> 02:30:26.755
Wait a second.

02:30:27.800 --> 02:30:30.190
Stop! Don't touch her!

02:30:30.320 --> 02:30:32.835
You can't touch her! You can't!

02:30:33.920 --> 02:30:36.754
- I can go get them...
- Please go!

02:30:36.960 --> 02:30:39.429
Mashiro! Wake up!

02:30:39.600 --> 02:30:41.159
Mashiro!

02:30:42.120 --> 02:30:43.600
Please, calm down!

02:31:19.320 --> 02:31:20.674
Could you take these?

02:31:24.520 --> 02:31:26.637
We are... um...

02:31:26.800 --> 02:31:27.870
Is that okay?

02:31:28.000 --> 02:31:29.000
Excuse me?

02:31:30.600 --> 02:31:33.434
We're almost like strangers.

02:31:33.720 --> 02:31:37.031
So perhaps we shouldn't be here.

02:31:37.400 --> 02:31:41.872
But in a way, we are like family...

02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:48.794
They are her family.

02:31:53.720 --> 02:31:54.915
Please follow me.

02:32:01.120 --> 02:32:03.510
We have your seats at the front.

02:32:22.320 --> 02:32:25.438
The family has arrived.

02:32:27.320 --> 02:32:29.312
We will proceed with the ceremony.

02:32:38.520 --> 02:32:39.520
Who are they?

02:33:13.320 --> 02:33:14.834
Please say your farewell.

02:33:20.400 --> 02:33:23.757
Come now, stop crying.

02:33:24.640 --> 02:33:25.994
Get yourself together.

02:33:29.200 --> 02:33:30.395
I know.

02:33:59.360 --> 02:34:00.840
It's hard.

02:34:03.120 --> 02:34:04.759
It really is.

02:34:06.400 --> 02:34:08.153
It's tough for all of us.

02:34:18.320 --> 02:34:19.515
Um...

02:34:21.800 --> 02:34:25.635
Mashiro told me not to say anything...

02:34:26.280 --> 02:34:27.555
...but I knew.

02:34:28.520 --> 02:34:29.636
Knew what?

02:34:29.640 --> 02:34:31.040
About her illness.

02:34:32.360 --> 02:34:34.511
I did a lesbian shoot with her...

02:34:34.760 --> 02:34:36.877
...and found a lump on her breast.

02:34:37.760 --> 02:34:39.752
It was almost a year ago.

02:34:42.160 --> 02:34:44.152
She never said anything to me.

02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:46.837
She said she'd kill me if I did.

02:34:48.040 --> 02:34:49.269
She would.

02:34:50.240 --> 02:34:51.560
Yeah, she would.

02:34:52.560 --> 02:34:54.791
Treatment would have saved her.

02:34:56.960 --> 02:35:01.000
But she said that she didn't want
to quit working.

02:35:02.640 --> 02:35:05.917
She said that surgery would leave a scar.

02:35:07.800 --> 02:35:11.760
She said only she could play
the role of Mashiro Satonaka.

02:35:12.160 --> 02:35:14.720
That was why she couldn't quit.

02:35:15.880 --> 02:35:17.030
What an idiot.

02:35:17.640 --> 02:35:19.279
If you die, it's all over.

02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:20.919
That's true but...

02:35:21.760 --> 02:35:25.151
But I know what she means.

02:35:26.320 --> 02:35:30.155
I also made choices when I chose this job.

02:35:32.880 --> 02:35:37.511
If I weren't an actress,
I wouldn't have anything.

02:35:38.960 --> 02:35:40.679
No point if you die...

02:36:26.520 --> 02:36:29.319
I found her mother's whereabouts.

02:36:30.040 --> 02:36:31.360
She's in Kawasaki.

02:36:32.680 --> 02:36:34.000
That's right nearby.

02:36:34.160 --> 02:36:35.230
That's right.

02:36:40.280 --> 02:36:42.590
So her remains will go there?

02:36:43.000 --> 02:36:44.719
They don't want them.

02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:54.757
I was told to throw them into some river.

02:36:56.640 --> 02:36:58.233
- A river...
- Yes.

02:37:04.080 --> 02:37:06.072
What can I say to that?

02:37:12.640 --> 02:37:15.109
Shall we make a visit to the Ganges River?

02:37:44.880 --> 02:37:46.234
Excuse me!

02:37:47.280 --> 02:37:48.280
Come on in.

02:37:48.800 --> 02:37:49.995
Pardon me.

02:37:51.040 --> 02:37:52.269
Come on up, Nanami.

02:37:52.800 --> 02:37:53.950
Pardon me.

02:37:55.760 --> 02:37:58.753
Where should I put your daughter?

02:37:59.320 --> 02:38:01.959
I already told you that I don't want her.

02:38:01.960 --> 02:38:03.792
Now, now, don't say that.

02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:05.593
We'll take her back if you want.

02:38:05.680 --> 02:38:07.319
Please come and see her.

02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:08.436
What are you drinking?

02:38:08.440 --> 02:38:10.193
Don't mind us.

02:38:14.920 --> 02:38:16.434
Let's put her there.

02:38:17.080 --> 02:38:19.356
- We'll get things started.
- Without permission?

02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:21.957
Excuse me while I borrow these.

02:38:28.800 --> 02:38:30.837
What do you think you're doing?

02:38:31.320 --> 02:38:33.073
I apologize for my forwardness.

02:38:35.600 --> 02:38:36.750
Does Shochu work for you?

02:38:36.920 --> 02:38:38.639
No, I drove here.

02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:42.039
I'll call a driver for you so grab a glass.

02:38:42.120 --> 02:38:43.236
Bide the spirits away.

02:38:43.240 --> 02:38:45.675
Oh no, what have we here...

02:38:46.040 --> 02:38:47.520
That's enough, thank you.

02:38:49.960 --> 02:38:51.030
That's good.

02:38:52.320 --> 02:38:53.320
Thank you.

02:39:03.640 --> 02:39:06.360
You're quite the drinker.

02:39:06.520 --> 02:39:09.080
Can we talk a little
before you drink too much?

02:39:16.240 --> 02:39:17.560
First of all...

02:39:17.800 --> 02:39:23.398
...this is the money that
Mashiro left behind.

02:39:23.840 --> 02:39:30.952
We've taken off a 15% fee.

02:39:33.960 --> 02:39:36.111
Here is the ink.

02:39:37.920 --> 02:39:41.630
Here is the amount in cash.

02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:43.560
Please make sure it's all there.

02:39:43.680 --> 02:39:44.680
And sign here.

02:39:47.000 --> 02:39:49.834
What about her burial?

02:39:50.680 --> 02:39:52.876
- A grave...
- Yes.

02:39:53.040 --> 02:39:56.192
Would you like us to take care of it?

02:39:56.800 --> 02:39:58.917
She's not my daughter anymore...

02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:01.917
- ...so yes, please.
- Alright then.

02:40:01.920 --> 02:40:05.960
Then we'll take the fee
out of this amount here.

02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:07.958
One moment, please.

02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:14.075
This is the total minus the burial fee.

02:40:14.280 --> 02:40:16.158
Please sign here.

02:40:16.400 --> 02:40:19.199
We'll take the fee from here.

02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:30.157
This is the total L

02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:40.680
It's all there.

02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:41.720
Yes L

02:40:54.080 --> 02:40:57.278
This isn't the face she was born with.

02:40:59.360 --> 02:41:02.432
She had these flat, dot-like eyes.

02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:07.997
I can't tell who she is anymore.

02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:18.075
You're quite the drinker!

02:41:19.800 --> 02:41:20.995
You can hold your liquor.

02:41:21.520 --> 02:41:22.920
Don't be silly.

02:41:24.120 --> 02:41:25.998
I'll fall asleep soon enough.

02:41:26.240 --> 02:41:28.436
So just leave me and go.

02:41:29.840 --> 02:41:31.240
Drink up.

02:41:32.520 --> 02:41:34.239
A taste, then.

02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:36.915
Thank you.

02:41:52.560 --> 02:41:54.119
Are you the same...

02:41:54.440 --> 02:41:56.079
The same as her?

02:41:57.840 --> 02:41:58.840
What?

02:41:59.080 --> 02:42:00.639
A porn star?

02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:04.357
No, I'm not.

02:42:05.240 --> 02:42:10.360
It's not something a normal
person can do anyways.

02:42:13.360 --> 02:42:18.196
Do you know how much
trouble that girl caused?

02:42:21.120 --> 02:42:24.796
Getting naked in front
of all those people...

02:42:26.680 --> 02:42:28.319
...making money...

02:42:30.040 --> 02:42:32.680
...and living a glamorous life at that!

02:42:34.240 --> 02:42:37.631
Not sending a bit of
money back here either.

02:42:40.760 --> 02:42:42.513
She'd been missing...

02:42:45.000 --> 02:42:47.071
...for all of 10 years.

02:42:49.920 --> 02:42:55.837
A friend came and showed me a magazine.

02:42:57.800 --> 02:43:02.158
Mashiro is a porn star now, he said to me.

02:43:09.080 --> 02:43:14.678
I asked a friend to find her...

02:43:17.520 --> 02:43:18.795
...and I hit her.

02:43:20.880 --> 02:43:24.840
I hit her so much, enough
to break her bones.

02:43:26.040 --> 02:43:30.034
Hitting her face, one after the other.

02:43:34.120 --> 02:43:38.831
I hit her so that she could never
be in those videos again.

02:43:43.120 --> 02:43:45.396
We didn't talk at all, did we?

02:43:48.000 --> 02:43:49.878
Neither her nor me.

02:43:53.640 --> 02:43:55.597
I just hit her...

02:43:57.080 --> 02:43:59.037
...and came right back.

02:44:02.600 --> 02:44:04.239
I hadn't seen her since.

02:44:31.240 --> 02:44:33.118
What are you doing?

02:44:48.760 --> 02:44:50.991
This isn't the bathroom.

02:45:02.240 --> 02:45:03.674
This...

02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:06.916
...being naked in front of people...

02:45:08.720 --> 02:45:11.952
...it's just embarrassing.

02:46:00.880 --> 02:46:01.996
Thank you!

02:46:12.240 --> 02:46:13.799
Delicious!

02:46:14.600 --> 02:46:17.035
Amuro! You should drink too!

02:46:17.560 --> 02:46:19.631
Can I please have another?

02:46:35.040 --> 02:46:36.679
Let's drink to her!

02:46:37.560 --> 02:46:38.560
Let's drink!

02:46:52.040 --> 02:46:53.679
Damn delicious!

02:47:06.840 --> 02:47:09.400
This is too embarrassing!

02:47:16.440 --> 02:47:19.911
You should strip too!

02:47:20.160 --> 02:47:21.160
Come on!

02:47:21.240 --> 02:47:22.276
Take it off!

02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:24.996
Let's drink with your daughter!

02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:36.640
It's your daughter.

02:49:52.680 --> 02:49:56.720
You're in a new room again.

02:49:57.560 --> 02:49:59.597
You're right. I moved here.

02:50:00.080 --> 02:50:01.719
I'm living by myself now.

02:50:02.280 --> 02:50:05.398
I want to visit Tokyo.

02:50:06.040 --> 02:50:07.076
Why is that?

02:50:08.440 --> 02:50:10.033
Because I've never been there.

02:50:12.600 --> 02:50:14.557
Do you want to stay here when you come?

02:50:15.240 --> 02:50:17.038
I'll show you around.

02:50:17.800 --> 02:50:20.395
What's it like in Tokyo?

02:50:22.600 --> 02:50:23.920
What is it like...

02:50:29.120 --> 02:50:30.873
I wonder that myself.

02:50:36.200 --> 02:50:37.270
Sorry that I'm late.

02:50:38.240 --> 02:50:39.435
Gifts for your new room.

02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:40.840
What?

02:50:41.360 --> 02:50:42.635
Where did you get all these?

02:50:42.800 --> 02:50:45.110
The unwanted items from all over.

02:50:46.400 --> 02:50:49.518
This is too much for my room.

02:50:49.600 --> 02:50:52.399
Oh no, just take what you need from here.

02:50:53.360 --> 02:50:55.238
- How silly of me.
- Of course.

02:50:57.360 --> 02:50:59.113
But I feel bad.

02:50:59.240 --> 02:51:00.594
Don't worry about it.

02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:02.239
They're not mine to begin with...

02:51:02.360 --> 02:51:03.679
...and they're being thrown out.

02:51:03.680 --> 02:51:04.680
Oh?

02:51:06.160 --> 02:51:07.560
This is all trash.

02:51:08.040 --> 02:51:10.999
That's one way to say it,
but they're also called furniture.

02:51:11.080 --> 02:51:13.390
- The rest is thrown away?
- Yes.

02:51:13.520 --> 02:51:14.749
What a waste.

02:51:14.880 --> 02:51:17.634
True, but there's nowhere else to put them.

02:51:19.360 --> 02:51:20.360
Take your pick.

02:51:22.080 --> 02:51:23.150
I can't choose.

02:51:23.400 --> 02:51:25.710
I feel sorry for them so it's even harder.

02:51:27.800 --> 02:51:29.712
This is the last of it.

02:51:30.120 --> 02:51:30.871
And this?

02:51:30.920 --> 02:51:31.920
Right here.

02:51:33.840 --> 02:51:36.594
And this, I'm sorry it's in cash.

02:51:37.280 --> 02:51:39.112
It's your last pay as a maid.

02:51:40.880 --> 02:51:41.791
No, I can't.

02:51:41.800 --> 02:51:44.395
No, please accept this.

02:51:45.000 --> 02:51:47.356
It's the money you earned.

02:51:50.320 --> 02:51:51.117
Okay.

02:51:51.120 --> 02:51:54.033
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

02:51:54.640 --> 02:51:55.835
Please count it.

02:51:56.200 --> 02:51:57.270
I will.

02:52:02.200 --> 02:52:03.839
This is nice.

02:52:09.840 --> 02:52:11.672
And quite the view too.

02:52:12.320 --> 02:52:13.390
It is.

02:52:16.840 --> 02:52:18.035
It feels great.

02:52:21.880 --> 02:52:24.952
Please get in touch if
you ever need anything.

02:52:25.600 --> 02:52:28.035
Thank you for everything.

02:52:30.560 --> 02:52:31.960
No, thank you.

02:52:39.360 --> 02:52:40.396
See you again.

02:52:40.920 --> 02:52:41.990
Again.

02:52:42.400 --> 02:52:43.720
Goodbye then.

02:52:52.520 --> 02:52:53.874
Keep on coming.

02:52:59.560 --> 02:53:00.676
Farewell.

02:53:01.160 --> 02:53:03.356
Thank you so much!
