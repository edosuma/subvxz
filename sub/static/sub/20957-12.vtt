Previously on <i>Wynonna Earp.</i>

00:01.541 --> 00:03.063
The universe has never given me a choice

00:03.098 --> 00:05.336
about whether I wanted to
be the heir or a mother.

00:05.371 --> 00:07.168
- Doc might not be the dad.
- Then who is?

00:07.203 --> 00:08.186
You had sex...

00:08.221 --> 00:09.577
- ...with a revenant.
- I'm your kid's father.

00:09.612 --> 00:10.429
My DNA test.

00:10.472 --> 00:13.727
I'm not a child, Nicole! From the look
on your face, I'm not an Earp either.

00:13.793 --> 00:16.043
The Order, they call it a weapon.

00:16.085 --> 00:18.065
- Wynonna...
- I know how to get her back!

00:18.110 --> 00:19.260
- Who?!
- Wynonna!

00:20.364 --> 00:23.123
I will not and cannot go back to Hell.

00:23.158 --> 00:25.639
Old Clootie has the power
to make sure I never do.

00:25.683 --> 00:29.141
They broke it. Now we're all gonna
buy it. Not now. Please! Oh...

00:35.377 --> 00:36.791
BOBO DEL REY!

00:36.854 --> 00:38.654
You do not get to do this.

00:38.713 --> 00:40.314
You do not get to win!

00:40.537 --> 00:42.464
Move her, or I will.

00:42.499 --> 00:45.756
I mean it! Stand down, you shit strumpets.

00:45.869 --> 00:48.514
And you. That is a woman's coat!

00:48.575 --> 00:49.612
Ouch.

00:50.159 --> 00:53.776
New, gay Waverly's a little judgey,
though I like the new sass...

00:53.811 --> 00:55.380
and how you betrayed your sister.

00:55.412 --> 00:56.880
You won't hurt me.

00:56.914 --> 00:58.309
I won't help you, either.

00:59.250 --> 01:02.320
Giving a shit about you

01:02.353 --> 01:04.379
has only caused me pain.

01:04.414 --> 01:06.283
No one said parenthood was easy.

01:06.793 --> 01:08.491
It's time to grow up...

01:09.150 --> 01:10.219
...little girl.

01:12.822 --> 01:16.070
No more growing up for
Waverly. She's cooked.

01:16.125 --> 01:18.118
Wynonna!

01:18.163 --> 01:20.161
All I smell is fried bride.

01:20.196 --> 01:21.864
Oh, look, sister!

01:21.967 --> 01:24.315
An Earp-a-tizer
for both of us.

01:24.366 --> 01:25.539
Robert Svane.

01:25.587 --> 01:27.124
Gestating bitch.

01:27.203 --> 01:29.492
Not so into angels anymore then, Bobo?

01:29.723 --> 01:32.478
Let's just say, I got sick
of betting on the losing team.

01:32.548 --> 01:35.750
Why are you back? How many times
do I have to put you in the ground?

01:38.146 --> 01:40.464
Your bullets are useless against us.

01:40.526 --> 01:43.718
The third seal is broken.

01:43.767 --> 01:44.702
He's risen.

02:14.541 --> 02:15.875
Oh, my God! Is the baby OK?

02:15.929 --> 02:18.520
Please, please tell me
you're OK! Hey, hey, hey.

02:18.575 --> 02:20.031
I forgot he could do that.

02:24.396 --> 02:26.332
Any chance you forgot what I did?

02:28.989 --> 02:31.624
I also blew up Nicole, Jeremy and our barn,

02:31.721 --> 02:33.122
just to bring you back.

02:33.887 --> 02:34.922
That's sweet.

02:35.780 --> 02:38.857
When this is done, I'm gonna shove grass
down your pants, just to watch you squirm.

02:38.925 --> 02:39.894
But...

02:40.368 --> 02:41.471
for now...

02:42.302 --> 02:43.270
come here.

02:48.587 --> 02:49.768
Missed you.

02:53.346 --> 02:55.398
How is Bobo resurrected?

02:55.554 --> 02:57.353
Oh, during the vision quest, I kinda died.

02:57.423 --> 02:58.290
What?!

02:58.328 --> 02:59.296
Yeah.

03:00.049 --> 03:01.480
I'm still the Earp heir.

03:01.584 --> 03:02.519
Yeah...

03:02.963 --> 03:04.332
and our only hope.

03:05.625 --> 03:07.261
So, what do we do first?

03:09.362 --> 03:11.532
Make sure John Henry Holliday is not dead.

03:19.292 --> 03:20.227
Latex?

03:21.157 --> 03:22.025
What?

03:23.640 --> 03:24.575
Wynonna.

03:34.679 --> 03:36.516
- WYNONNA! WAVERLY!
- Dolls!

03:36.548 --> 03:37.707
Hey!

03:37.742 --> 03:39.049
Is she back? Is she...

03:39.084 --> 03:41.023
Oh, I am so glad to see you morons!

03:41.083 --> 03:42.560
Uh... thank you?

03:44.231 --> 03:45.695
Any idea where you disappeared to?

03:45.730 --> 03:47.593
The last thing I remember I was with you,

03:47.625 --> 03:48.990
holding that plate.

03:49.046 --> 03:50.216
And then next thing I know,

03:50.263 --> 03:52.801
I'm in a ditch. Story of
my life. What about you?

03:52.874 --> 03:56.011
- I woke up in a body bag.
- And they say you don't know how to party.

03:56.131 --> 03:56.967
What about Doc?

03:57.033 --> 03:58.881
Probably in a similar situation.

03:59.270 --> 04:00.413
Because I killed him.

04:00.472 --> 04:02.768
- Jesus...
- Yeah.

04:02.830 --> 04:04.166
How the hell did you guys make it?

04:04.201 --> 04:06.410
It's kind of a... fog between what happened

04:06.445 --> 04:08.799
and what didn't happen.
Un-happened? I don't know.

04:08.863 --> 04:12.186
Well, I wish I could make
everything I did... un-happen.

04:12.251 --> 04:13.874
Hey. Then Nicole wouldn't be here.

04:13.920 --> 04:17.567
OK. It's settled. Everyone stops dying.

04:17.623 --> 04:19.817
Or... tries really hard not to,

04:19.853 --> 04:20.755
now that...

04:21.440 --> 04:23.261
this third seal is broken.

04:23.307 --> 04:24.175
What!?

04:24.403 --> 04:25.507
Bobo's back,

04:25.577 --> 04:28.296
and he's hangin' with
Widow Beth and Mercedes.

04:29.668 --> 04:32.356
He crushed the seal, aka Doc's ring,

04:32.835 --> 04:34.736
- and made the earth cry.
- Oh, yeah.

04:34.790 --> 04:37.610
We heard it. Like Godzilla
if he stepped on a Lego.

04:37.681 --> 04:40.351
Yeah. That was the sound
of the demon Clootie waking.

04:41.479 --> 04:43.487
Guys, I really buggered this up.

04:43.582 --> 04:45.317
Flush it out. No more guilt.

04:45.351 --> 04:48.120
No more secrets. We don't
have time for feelings.

04:48.154 --> 04:50.156
We need a plan. And we need it fast,

04:50.188 --> 04:52.850
'cause this sucker's comin' out my vagina.

04:52.896 --> 04:54.659
Yeah, my vagina, Jeremy.

04:54.692 --> 04:56.655
Any minute. So...

04:57.918 --> 05:00.308
Speaking of flushing, anyone need to pee?

05:00.476 --> 05:02.426
- No.
- No? No one?

05:02.461 --> 05:04.698
OK, just me. Be right back.

05:09.719 --> 05:11.740
After you, ladies.

05:11.881 --> 05:14.563
He can't be here. This
isn't consecrated ground!

05:14.640 --> 05:16.242
Oh, but it is...

05:16.582 --> 05:17.894
to the Assiniboine.

05:18.851 --> 05:20.185
All of this.

05:20.418 --> 05:22.571
You moved his coffin to an old mine?

05:22.687 --> 05:25.544
- It got in the way of the dig.
- Right.

05:25.596 --> 05:28.792
For Constance's sons. She
told us of your failures.

05:28.846 --> 05:30.367
And then pop!

05:30.424 --> 05:31.648
Off went her head.

05:31.710 --> 05:33.696
Her death was deserved.

05:33.731 --> 05:35.000
But our husband lives!

05:35.056 --> 05:37.259
And two wives are better than none.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.716
We must tend to him
with the vigor of three.

05:41.240 --> 05:42.576
Sure.

05:52.670 --> 05:55.895
Bless the sands, it's truly him!

05:57.151 --> 06:00.577
Let's just hope Old Sheriff Clootie
is in the mood for bargaining.

06:02.679 --> 06:04.247
Needless to say, if you betray us,

06:04.282 --> 06:06.271
he'll see you rot in Hell forever.

06:06.332 --> 06:07.400
Lady...

06:08.333 --> 06:10.168
he's my only hope not to.

06:10.201 --> 06:11.967
Guard him with your life,

06:12.035 --> 06:14.607
and he will surely spare
you that fate again.

06:18.347 --> 06:19.773
Then let's dig him up.

06:29.949 --> 06:31.272
You sure this'll work?

06:31.999 --> 06:33.156
Hell no.

06:33.262 --> 06:35.303
Which is exactly why it might.

06:35.356 --> 06:37.457
It's Wynonna logic. Don't question.

06:37.516 --> 06:38.764
It's not just that.

06:40.532 --> 06:41.367
Watch.

06:45.560 --> 06:46.462
See?

06:46.958 --> 06:48.430
It's like they know each other!

06:48.516 --> 06:51.216
- Whoa.
- Gun and plate, sittin' in a tree.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.363
- Oh, boy.
- It's our only shot.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.710
Jeremy, figure out where Bobo
and the Widows were going.

06:56.745 --> 06:58.115
My bet's on Clootie's tomb.

06:58.228 --> 07:00.499
Yay, off to the maps! Again!

07:00.550 --> 07:01.651
- Dolls.
- Yeah?

07:02.149 --> 07:03.665
Find Doc. He needs to be here.

07:04.309 --> 07:06.023
And try not to kill him again.

07:06.087 --> 07:07.243
You know I can't promise that.

07:07.326 --> 07:09.427
Well, I promised I wouldn't
break it without him.

07:09.998 --> 07:11.959
This ring kept him ageless, and now he...

07:13.616 --> 07:14.900
What if he's...

07:14.973 --> 07:16.167
Hey, he's not.

07:16.285 --> 07:17.913
I'd feel it in my groin.

07:21.467 --> 07:24.058
I feel like just for that,
I get to say "vagina" again.

07:24.115 --> 07:25.084
Mhm.

07:25.264 --> 07:26.446
I'll find him.

07:27.729 --> 07:29.364
And I'll go deal with this.

07:30.332 --> 07:31.634
Then I'm coming with.

07:31.834 --> 07:33.586
Especially with the due date being, like...

07:33.657 --> 07:35.498
well, as far as anyone can guess,

07:35.587 --> 07:38.814
now-ish, I'm not letting
you out of my sight.

07:39.052 --> 07:40.021
Well...

07:40.077 --> 07:41.302
when this goes down,

07:41.376 --> 07:43.612
you're gonna see a lot
more than you bargained for.

07:46.393 --> 07:48.496
- Haught?
- Yeah, I remember.

07:49.154 --> 07:50.285
I got you, Earp.

07:53.271 --> 07:55.558
Wait... What happened
to flushing our secrets?

07:57.106 --> 07:58.041
Ooh.

08:09.468 --> 08:11.252
He feels a little light.

08:12.407 --> 08:14.068
Oh...

08:14.147 --> 08:16.124
Let thee rise.

08:20.715 --> 08:23.903
Oh... What happened, my master?

08:23.963 --> 08:25.851
Over 100 years underground,

08:26.014 --> 08:28.225
- that's what happened.
- He's weak.

08:29.525 --> 08:30.726
Feed...

08:31.249 --> 08:32.342
Pure...

08:32.404 --> 08:33.539
Nourishment.

08:34.697 --> 08:36.022
The Heir.

08:38.357 --> 08:39.714
Wynonna Earp?

08:39.900 --> 08:42.703
He's suggesting we feed
him her baby, dipshit.

08:42.736 --> 08:45.555
Yes. Yes!

08:45.640 --> 08:47.922
A most powerful cure for what ails you.

08:47.997 --> 08:49.883
You shall have it, my darling.

08:49.944 --> 08:51.580
Warm... fresh,

08:51.660 --> 08:53.395
straight out of the oven.

08:53.549 --> 08:55.727
Your wives will provide.

08:55.899 --> 08:57.987
Sister, we did it.

08:58.042 --> 09:01.356
Despite all of our differences,
we fulfilled our purpose.

09:01.390 --> 09:03.251
We saved our husband.

09:04.224 --> 09:07.699
And now, we shall serve
him for all of eternity.

09:07.800 --> 09:08.891
Actually...

09:08.997 --> 09:10.829
I want a separation.

09:12.453 --> 09:14.054
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

09:14.316 --> 09:17.021
Chopped my way into the 21st century.

09:17.150 --> 09:19.072
The world has changed.

09:19.142 --> 09:20.809
Hell, look at Wynonna Earp.

09:20.842 --> 09:24.597
She is 10 times the
gunslinger Wyatt ever was

09:24.712 --> 09:26.547
and he put Bulshar in the ground!

09:26.601 --> 09:28.036
I want that ring!

09:28.122 --> 09:31.042
You were always a fraud.
You never believed!

09:31.112 --> 09:33.233
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

09:33.272 --> 09:35.358
Left you to rot in that box!

09:35.390 --> 09:36.825
Oh...

09:36.859 --> 09:40.462
Your rotten box can
wait on him for eternity.

09:44.740 --> 09:46.838
MERCEDES!

09:46.934 --> 09:48.973
Shh!

09:49.071 --> 09:51.117
What's that sound?

09:51.358 --> 09:53.329
You sisters are wild.

09:54.042 --> 09:55.661
You know, Constance liked to trap people

09:55.709 --> 09:57.777
in stone and darkness, too.

09:58.780 --> 10:00.162
Clever girl.

10:01.783 --> 10:04.581
NO!

10:12.177 --> 10:13.768
Who's rising now?

10:30.546 --> 10:33.368
Witches get stitches.

10:33.862 --> 10:35.261
Especially...

10:35.546 --> 10:38.635
if they wish you and your
unborn child into oblivion.

10:38.670 --> 10:41.062
Super rude.

10:41.150 --> 10:43.140
OK, look. I... I learned my lesson.

10:43.237 --> 10:45.034
I'll never trouble you Earps again.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.449
You look like Mattie, but
you're nothing like her.

10:47.505 --> 10:49.561
The best part of me died with my sister.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.361
I... I thought it was your fault.

10:52.986 --> 10:56.429
Your sister is the only reason I'm
not going to punch you in the jugs.

10:56.483 --> 10:57.447
That...

11:00.586 --> 11:02.703
...and I plan to exploit you.

11:03.730 --> 11:05.751
Yeah? And what can I do?

11:05.832 --> 11:07.180
The third seal's already been broken.

11:07.255 --> 11:10.838
The Shadow Lord stirs and his
wives grow even more powerful.

11:10.917 --> 11:12.781
My family still remembers
the last time he ruled.

11:12.867 --> 11:13.738
So does ours.

11:13.817 --> 11:16.642
We get nasty demonic reminders,
try to kill us on the regs.

11:16.909 --> 11:19.757
Clootie isn't invincible.
Wyatt defeated him once...

11:19.828 --> 11:21.454
Defeated? No.

11:21.489 --> 11:23.372
Delayed? Maybe.

11:23.465 --> 11:25.279
And look at the cost.

11:25.358 --> 11:27.140
Even that gun isn't enough.

11:27.200 --> 11:29.002
How 'bout some stylish dinnerware?

11:31.223 --> 11:32.734
Where did you get that?

11:32.828 --> 11:34.378
- I lost a hand for it.
- Mhm.

11:34.425 --> 11:35.563
And I bit the big one.

11:35.598 --> 11:37.966
Short version: It's a weapon.

11:38.002 --> 11:41.480
Legend has it your grandfather Edwin
ascertained that it was only a shield.

11:41.550 --> 11:43.486
Well, we don't need a shield.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.739
We need a friggin' missile.

11:46.706 --> 11:47.938
Holliday?

11:48.298 --> 11:50.041
Whatever you're looking for,

11:50.126 --> 11:52.326
you're not gonna find it in that well.

11:52.412 --> 11:53.587
Doc.

11:53.681 --> 11:54.418
Henry.

11:54.453 --> 11:56.690
Hey! Hey! Doc, look. Look. Look. It's OK.

11:56.749 --> 11:59.265
Everything is back to normal.

11:59.640 --> 12:00.899
Normal.

12:02.605 --> 12:05.041
That's what I am now, I suppose.

12:07.486 --> 12:08.885
Mortal.

12:09.908 --> 12:12.036
I can feel it in my bones.

12:12.581 --> 12:14.050
In my lungs.

12:15.116 --> 12:16.274
The burning.

12:16.342 --> 12:18.961
Your ring was broken, but not by Wynonna.

12:18.996 --> 12:20.799
It does not matter who did it!

12:22.652 --> 12:24.812
I've seen my future...

12:25.259 --> 12:27.763
...my great, heroic ending.

12:27.836 --> 12:29.842
We shot each other, but now we're alive.

12:29.928 --> 12:33.240
And if it's an apology that
you're looking for, then I'm sorry.

12:33.330 --> 12:34.933
But Wynonna's back.

12:35.444 --> 12:38.409
We all are, and that is thanks to you, Doc.

12:39.482 --> 12:40.584
Did you see her?

12:40.648 --> 12:42.884
Not a scratch. Still pregnant...

12:43.113 --> 12:45.199
and still itching to shoot something.

12:45.887 --> 12:47.358
The Widows...

12:48.469 --> 12:49.607
Bobo.

12:50.429 --> 12:52.131
Bobo has returned?

12:52.195 --> 12:53.319
From Hell?

12:53.364 --> 12:54.866
Doc...

12:54.924 --> 12:56.776
the Earp heir needs our help.

12:58.351 --> 12:59.887
And here I was...

13:01.330 --> 13:04.300
hoping to remain not
dead for a few more hours.

13:05.370 --> 13:06.435
You OK?

13:08.294 --> 13:09.806
- Mhm.
- I should have trusted you.

13:09.868 --> 13:12.308
- I'm... I know...
- I'm terrified,

13:12.415 --> 13:14.610
'cause my sister, who's
supposed to be the smart,

13:14.661 --> 13:17.133
moral one royally screwed us?

13:19.490 --> 13:21.657
Though I suppose it was
for someone you love.

13:21.757 --> 13:23.227
Nicole's married.

13:23.489 --> 13:26.960
- To a dude?!
- No, a gorgeous lady doctor.

13:28.131 --> 13:30.258
OK, well...

13:30.367 --> 13:33.107
I have eyes, Waverly. Nicole loves you.

13:33.203 --> 13:34.505
And I'm not your sister.

13:34.615 --> 13:37.011
The DNA test confirmed...

13:38.075 --> 13:39.777
...Wynonna, I'm not an Earp.

13:41.011 --> 13:42.085
Like hell you're not.

13:44.967 --> 13:46.982
Well, you were right.

13:47.216 --> 13:49.102
Made from the same metal as Peacemaker.

13:49.157 --> 13:51.181
Good news is, it also
had traces of ammolite,

13:51.228 --> 13:53.424
which is the mineral
that protects your land.

13:53.518 --> 13:55.492
The bad news?

13:58.663 --> 14:00.981
Well, I guess it was a side plate.

14:02.198 --> 14:03.368
It's enough.

14:03.430 --> 14:05.983
I know you're bad at math,
but there are two widows.

14:06.061 --> 14:07.238
It's not for them.

14:07.270 --> 14:09.100
It's for their asshole husband.

14:09.154 --> 14:10.561
Cut the head off an eel

14:10.640 --> 14:13.114
and his parasites shrivel up and die, too.

14:14.574 --> 14:17.336
And I end the curse, once and for all.

14:24.554 --> 14:26.183
And now...

14:26.233 --> 14:27.533
I have to pee again.

14:31.754 --> 14:33.420
Ooh.

14:33.714 --> 14:37.681
Oh, I haven't felt this off since
the 2005 Chili Cook Off debacle.

14:37.735 --> 14:40.221
Wynonna... I don't think that's chili.

14:40.291 --> 14:43.862
My previous conjectures about holy
sites aren't even a thing anymore.

14:43.924 --> 14:46.951
Bobo Del Rey's involvement is
harshing up my whole system!

14:47.013 --> 14:49.760
- Yeah, and you haven't even met him yet.
- I'm so OK with that.

14:49.830 --> 14:51.798
- I can't wait to meet the Pod, though.
- What?

14:51.872 --> 14:53.941
That's my codename for baby Earp.

14:54.002 --> 14:55.601
I'm gonna teach it how to rap.

14:56.160 --> 14:59.181
Why'd you stay, Jeremy?
After Black Badge dissolved?

14:59.267 --> 15:01.873
Wait. Wait. Uh... There
are two sites where Bobo had

15:01.927 --> 15:06.595
constant security. One, the shack where
he was holding Constance's sons' bones...

15:06.677 --> 15:09.552
- And the other?
- A condemned gold mine in the foothills.

15:09.607 --> 15:12.036
OK, yeah. Hey. You're...
you're pretty smart.

15:12.068 --> 15:13.972
Oh, I know. And, um...

15:14.005 --> 15:16.575
I stay because I don't fit in here,

15:16.707 --> 15:18.576
but none of you ask me to. I'm...

15:18.608 --> 15:20.433
I'm allowed to be me.

15:20.558 --> 15:21.520
You're part of the family.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.319
And being part of the family means...

15:24.582 --> 15:26.551
...dealing with terrifying forces of evil!

15:26.607 --> 15:29.548
Where is the Earp wench? I want my weapon.

15:29.871 --> 15:31.419
Why don't you eat mine.

15:31.522 --> 15:33.023
Looks like you're shit out of luck.

15:33.057 --> 15:34.106
Hardly.

15:34.179 --> 15:36.480
I just found me some bait.

15:38.212 --> 15:39.210
You drove my car?

15:39.245 --> 15:40.781
Yeah, and I changed
your radio settings, too.

15:40.844 --> 15:42.066
Man, we gotta talk

15:42.101 --> 15:43.810
- about your Adele obsession.
- Waverly?

15:43.873 --> 15:46.142
<i>Doc! We're headed to the
Homestead. We have a code:</i>

15:46.177 --> 15:49.315
- <i>Pot of Gold! Repeat. Pot. Of. Gold.</i>
- Dolls! Baby's coming.

15:49.373 --> 15:50.887
- You take Charlene.
- Whoa, OK! Yeah!

15:50.965 --> 15:51.589
I know a shortcut.

15:51.674 --> 15:54.596
Alright, listen. I'll get Dr.
Navalar. You go to Wynonna,

15:54.676 --> 15:56.445
and I'll bring her to the Homestead, OK?

15:57.616 --> 15:59.550
Oh! Hey, Holliday!

15:59.625 --> 16:02.799
Whatever wrong you did in
the past, some people say...

16:03.721 --> 16:05.882
...a baby's their immortality.

16:06.464 --> 16:08.888
You touch my radio
again, and I will gut you.

16:08.940 --> 16:09.908
Alright.

16:13.322 --> 16:15.579
Ahh! Cheesus coconuts!

16:15.690 --> 16:17.142
Why isn't there an app for this?

16:17.206 --> 16:18.628
OK! You're doing great.

16:18.727 --> 16:21.245
We're almost there. Oh, SHIT!

16:27.102 --> 16:28.393
Wynonna Earp.

16:28.436 --> 16:29.701
Time to meet destiny.

16:29.740 --> 16:32.837
Better not be a nickname for your
beav, 'cause I'm not in the mood.

16:32.891 --> 16:36.208
I've come for my weapon.
You will not deny me.

16:36.278 --> 16:37.056
I might.

16:37.126 --> 16:40.134
The Demon Lord is awake,
but he has not risen.

16:40.212 --> 16:42.551
I've come for the final
piece of the puzzle,

16:42.584 --> 16:45.104
and I am not talking
about that useless gun.

16:45.151 --> 16:46.488
Yeah, about that.

16:46.521 --> 16:49.247
Your stupid plate was tacky
as shit, so I melted it down,

16:49.287 --> 16:51.808
into one sexy, ammolite-laced bullet.

16:51.932 --> 16:54.282
Let them go, or I punch a hole

16:54.337 --> 16:57.501
into your no longer rotting,
but still stolen, face.

16:57.541 --> 16:59.569
You might wanna cool
that itchy trigger finger.

16:59.602 --> 17:02.307
I'm a bit hurt that I
wasn't invited to the party.

17:03.091 --> 17:05.209
Also that you tried to blow me up.

17:06.363 --> 17:08.608
Hear this, Wynonna Earp.

17:08.711 --> 17:11.544
The weapon I seek isn't that awful plate.

17:11.646 --> 17:14.882
It is you. And I intend to use it.

17:16.077 --> 17:19.155
Just so everyone's clear,
I'm my own damn weapon.

17:19.190 --> 17:21.343
And I'm about to unleash all this shit.

17:21.377 --> 17:23.289
One bullet, two of us.

17:23.363 --> 17:25.642
And then, there's my husband.

17:25.676 --> 17:27.646
But I can help you find the right path.

17:27.695 --> 17:29.413
You got some nerve, trying
to negotiate with me.

17:29.476 --> 17:31.101
You're still wearing my friend's face!

17:31.166 --> 17:32.577
And Bulshar's ring.

17:32.612 --> 17:33.673
Meaning...

17:33.720 --> 17:35.531
I can destroy the rest of your friends

17:35.586 --> 17:37.169
before your next breath,

17:37.251 --> 17:40.628
which seems to be quite... labored.

17:40.737 --> 17:41.610
Bulshar.

17:41.656 --> 17:43.291
My husband's true name,

17:43.646 --> 17:44.572
fires-given.

17:44.643 --> 17:46.044
Sorry I'm late.

17:47.382 --> 17:48.956
I kinda died.

17:49.018 --> 17:50.870
- Who didn't?
- Enough!

17:50.905 --> 17:53.207
Use the bullet on Beth

17:53.321 --> 17:54.843
and we'll take Bulshar down together.

17:54.921 --> 17:56.266
Shoot Mercedes

17:56.326 --> 17:58.395
or I kill your sister.

17:58.458 --> 17:59.953
Do you know what she wants?

18:00.008 --> 18:02.647
To feed your newborn to our husband.

18:03.273 --> 18:05.609
Join me, and we'll destroy him together...

18:05.642 --> 18:06.643
or I'll let her.

18:06.677 --> 18:09.257
Do not make the mistake
of threatening my child.

18:09.309 --> 18:11.356
That doesn't work on us.

18:11.411 --> 18:14.347
Maybe I should just take the
prize you are fighting for.

18:14.706 --> 18:15.963
Wynonna, what is he doing?

18:16.045 --> 18:18.978
I am the greatest
gunslinger that ever lived.

18:19.149 --> 18:22.603
When I pull this trigger, things die.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.425
Bad things.

18:24.629 --> 18:27.400
Mercy comes in many forms.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.483
You're confused.

18:29.784 --> 18:31.903
It's not so bad, Wynonna.

18:32.433 --> 18:33.699
Up there.

18:33.950 --> 18:37.949
I saw Wyatt, and he is
so damn proud of you.

18:38.266 --> 18:39.950
But I will kill us both

18:40.028 --> 18:42.940
before I let you walk
in service to the devil.

18:42.996 --> 18:44.279
It's a ruse.

18:44.314 --> 18:46.183
If I die, they can't use me.

18:46.216 --> 18:47.150
Wynonna?!

18:47.184 --> 18:48.595
Two birds...

18:49.020 --> 18:49.954
one stone.

18:49.986 --> 18:51.276
The baby's coming.

18:51.388 --> 18:53.031
You can save it. Aim high.

18:53.101 --> 18:54.407
I will do my best.

18:54.444 --> 18:56.347
I'll take one out on my way down.

18:56.694 --> 18:57.969
Or me.

18:58.042 --> 19:00.263
I am so very tired, Wynonna.

19:00.298 --> 19:01.410
Doc, don't!

19:01.449 --> 19:02.905
See you on the other side.

19:02.991 --> 19:05.936
So much bluffing, I'm
embarrassed for all of you!

19:12.241 --> 19:13.260
No, no, no!

19:26.850 --> 19:28.119
Oh, gross!

19:45.370 --> 19:47.640
I had no idea you could split a bullet.

19:47.737 --> 19:49.172
Neither did I.

19:52.741 --> 19:54.509
Been so long since I
actually killed something,

19:54.542 --> 19:56.346
I forgot how happy it makes me.

19:58.023 --> 20:00.156
Don't you two ever do that to me again!

20:00.509 --> 20:04.210
If it's been 12 minutes or less since
your last contraction, you're dilating.

20:04.282 --> 20:06.664
- You read the books?
- The Wikipedia.

20:06.788 --> 20:08.657
Look, guys! We need to get her anywhere

20:08.691 --> 20:10.631
that's not the middle
of the frickin' street!

20:12.127 --> 20:13.003
Come on, big mama!

20:13.057 --> 20:14.761
Did you just call me a "big mama"?

20:17.973 --> 20:19.602
I'm supposed to be at the Homestead

20:19.634 --> 20:21.479
where the revenants can't interfere!

20:21.557 --> 20:23.272
OK! I'll take you back to the truck.

20:23.984 --> 20:25.616
If you touch me, I'll bite it off!

20:25.673 --> 20:27.276
This is all its fault anyway!

20:27.308 --> 20:29.175
I... I have to go with her.

20:29.210 --> 20:30.615
And I've gotta get ready.

20:30.712 --> 20:32.414
What did Wynonna ask you to do?

20:32.927 --> 20:34.490
The only thing she could.

20:35.413 --> 20:38.663
Don't be too hard on her. OK?
She's really gonna need you after.

20:38.698 --> 20:39.923
Yeah. OK.

20:39.983 --> 20:40.823
OK.

20:47.065 --> 20:50.136
Well, what now? Back in my day,
the men just sat outside and smoked.

20:50.215 --> 20:52.569
Don't smoke, idiot. You're
about to be a father.

20:52.667 --> 20:55.410
Outstanding! Now the whole gang's
here and gonna see my destiny.

20:55.483 --> 20:57.930
- Should we Skype in Nedley?
- OK. We... we need a doctor!

20:57.980 --> 20:59.959
- Dolls is on it.
- OK, boys, go to the Homestead

21:00.048 --> 21:01.541
and get Wynonna's hospital go-bag.

21:01.576 --> 21:02.457
NO!

21:02.534 --> 21:03.664
The demon Clootie.

21:03.713 --> 21:06.204
Bulshar? Bullshit... whatever his name is,

21:06.250 --> 21:07.664
we need to know if he got out.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.669
I used up my... bullet.

21:09.751 --> 21:12.315
- Rest assured, I have plenty.
- I know where the tomb is.

21:12.391 --> 21:13.136
You are with me.

21:13.171 --> 21:14.200
- ALWAYS!
- Jeremy...

21:14.260 --> 21:15.095
Yeah?

21:15.892 --> 21:17.533
I'm glad you stayed in Purgatory.

21:17.605 --> 21:19.941
Then can I name the baby?
It feels like a Phil.

21:19.996 --> 21:21.163
Oh, God! Here comes another one!

21:21.196 --> 21:23.018
Get out of here before I murder you!

21:23.112 --> 21:25.105
- Whooo!
- Go!

21:25.308 --> 21:26.955
OK, I've been reading about home births.

21:26.990 --> 21:28.051
OK. That... that's great.

21:28.104 --> 21:30.105
Super. Uh, can you go
lock the door, please?

21:32.430 --> 21:34.128
- Rosita...
- I got you, Wynonna.

21:34.200 --> 21:35.268
I'm so sorry.

21:35.411 --> 21:38.214
You're sorry now... wait
until you have to push.

21:52.489 --> 21:54.509
You gotta be shittin' me right now.

21:54.660 --> 21:58.816
Ewan, is there a reason why you and your
boys are out here in your Sunday best?

21:58.894 --> 22:02.025
Deputy Marshal, I do believe you
were driving over the legal limit.

22:02.100 --> 22:05.638
I don't got time for this fake bullshit,
macho stand-off you got goin' on.

22:05.706 --> 22:07.293
I gotta go get a doctor.

22:07.403 --> 22:11.174
Dr. Navalar? Yes, we've taken care of her.

22:11.614 --> 22:13.182
What do you mean, taken care of her?

22:13.241 --> 22:14.908
She was a good woman.

22:14.993 --> 22:15.992
A civilian!

22:16.027 --> 22:18.295
As if you've never dispatched of either.

22:18.380 --> 22:19.677
You're a hypocrite, Xavier.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.891
So, what? You're gonna kill
everybody that knows about the baby?

22:21.923 --> 22:23.492
Not just any baby:

22:23.759 --> 22:25.129
the next Earp heir.

22:25.260 --> 22:29.214
Now, if my sources are correct,
it should be coming right...

22:29.292 --> 22:30.699
about... now.

22:34.904 --> 22:36.952
Ah... motherknuckles!

22:37.022 --> 22:38.890
- That's it! Deep breaths!
- OK, I'll get more towels.

22:38.937 --> 22:40.981
And whiskey. All the whiskeys.

22:41.035 --> 22:43.058
And a rum! It hardly matters now, does it?

22:43.108 --> 22:46.049
Oh, I'll mix up something.
Something not whiskey.

22:46.117 --> 22:49.599
Why did I lie on the pool table? There
are multiple couches right over there!

22:49.672 --> 22:51.376
You never were much for tradition.

22:51.449 --> 22:53.995
And I guess our baby won't
get the chance to learn ours.

22:54.061 --> 22:55.537
Nicole told you the plan.

22:55.705 --> 22:58.138
It's the only chance
we have to keep it safe.

22:58.193 --> 22:59.219
That's all that matters.

22:59.272 --> 23:02.072
It matters that you didn't
ask me. I could've helped!

23:02.107 --> 23:05.000
You are helping, cutie.

23:05.067 --> 23:06.036
And I w...

23:06.718 --> 23:09.022
I wanted to wait as long as
possible to break your heart.

23:09.084 --> 23:10.306
Besides...

23:10.361 --> 23:13.261
we don't know if you can even
leave the Ghost River Triangle.

23:13.339 --> 23:14.911
- Cross the line.
- What?

23:14.997 --> 23:17.500
- How long have you known?
- After my vision quest...

23:17.575 --> 23:18.945
I suspected.

23:19.088 --> 23:20.251
Seeing Bobo...

23:21.616 --> 23:24.135
Robert Svane, as he was...

23:25.390 --> 23:28.981
- he's your father, isn't he?
- I honestly don't know anymore.

23:29.067 --> 23:30.097
What would that make me?

23:30.160 --> 23:32.261
Daughter of an asshole. Join the club.

23:32.493 --> 23:35.197
OK? You're still you, Waverly.

23:35.614 --> 23:37.450
And if this baby is Jonas's...

23:38.800 --> 23:40.558
half-revenant, then I guess...

23:40.669 --> 23:42.571
I guess it won't be able to get out either.

23:44.973 --> 23:46.842
WAVERLY! What the hell?!

23:55.211 --> 23:57.312
Well, that was very emotional...

23:57.384 --> 23:58.328
and annoying.

23:58.391 --> 23:59.865
Rosita! Don't do this, please!

23:59.933 --> 24:01.984
It's done. And so am I.

24:02.078 --> 24:04.339
Done with your judgments,
your holier-than-thou attitude.

24:04.401 --> 24:06.748
Your "I'll shoot you last, Rosita."

24:06.818 --> 24:08.396
- I made a mistake.
- Well, so did I,

24:08.430 --> 24:10.948
thinking an Earp would
be anything but my enemy.

24:11.000 --> 24:14.024
- NO!
- Your baby is currency, Wynonna.

24:14.087 --> 24:16.538
The revenants, the Order, Black Badge...

24:16.571 --> 24:17.739
let's just say that...

24:17.801 --> 24:20.461
there are endless men that would
kill to get their hands on it.

24:21.743 --> 24:23.499
Guarantee me safe passage.

24:23.553 --> 24:25.032
You crazy traitor bitch!

24:25.087 --> 24:27.067
What does it matter? You're
not even keeping it anyway!

24:27.129 --> 24:31.213
Because I care more about this
than anything else in the world!

24:31.302 --> 24:33.107
I promise to get it out of you.

24:33.375 --> 24:35.885
Look, I promise it will survive.

24:35.990 --> 24:37.460
As for the mother...

24:41.763 --> 24:44.013
Bobo Del Rey.

24:44.645 --> 24:46.292
Love what you've done with your hair.

24:46.347 --> 24:47.514
Oh...

24:48.403 --> 24:50.370
He changed me, Doc.

24:50.437 --> 24:53.813
- The demon Clootie.
- His hellfire name...

24:53.956 --> 24:55.818
is Bulshar.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.012
And...

24:57.046 --> 24:58.252
he is free.

24:58.330 --> 24:59.649
Well, not for long.

24:59.692 --> 25:02.989
- We killed his demon brides.
- He shall have a new bride.

25:03.895 --> 25:05.382
Someone who's...

25:05.627 --> 25:06.762
pure.

25:06.855 --> 25:08.958
I pledged him my angel.

25:08.990 --> 25:11.758
I promised him Waverly.

25:12.795 --> 25:13.829
Hey, you shit ticket!

25:13.862 --> 25:15.649
JEREMY, NO!

25:19.222 --> 25:21.236
Oh, shit!

25:23.211 --> 25:24.501
Eight centimeters.

25:24.581 --> 25:26.156
- Getting close.
- Oh, good.

25:26.211 --> 25:27.942
It's fairly bad etiquette to kill someone

25:28.011 --> 25:29.912
after you've had your...
your fingers up their vag.

25:29.944 --> 25:32.857
I'll be sure to embroider that
on a throw pillow in your memory.

25:32.897 --> 25:34.297
What about Doc?

25:34.849 --> 25:35.901
He doesn't love me.

25:35.979 --> 25:39.146
- He does, in his way.
- When you disappeared,

25:39.265 --> 25:41.314
I saw what he was without you.

25:41.412 --> 25:43.448
Hard... cruel.

25:43.558 --> 25:45.592
Sounds like a match made in heaven.

25:46.450 --> 25:47.890
You don't know me at all.

25:47.960 --> 25:50.934
I know you're the type of
woman who made this about a guy.

25:51.012 --> 25:52.934
I know you'd better be
wearing a good sports bra

25:52.968 --> 25:56.180
'cause you're gonna have
to run so far, so fast.

25:56.388 --> 26:00.401
I know it won't matter 'cause
I'll never stop hunting you.

26:02.719 --> 26:03.943
My revenant brethren are coming.

26:03.997 --> 26:05.916
You should focus on, um...

26:05.986 --> 26:08.116
concentrate on pushing.

26:08.150 --> 26:09.585
Please...

26:10.024 --> 26:12.552
- let Waverly go.
- I'm not goin' anywhere.

26:15.565 --> 26:16.856
You wouldn't.

26:22.623 --> 26:24.606
You... you can't.

26:24.675 --> 26:26.346
You're not 27, you're not the heir.

26:26.422 --> 26:28.095
But you are my sister.

26:28.170 --> 26:30.133
- Wynonna, I...
- Waverly Earp.

26:30.225 --> 26:32.721
Yes, Earp! You listen to me!

26:32.762 --> 26:34.364
You are one of the good guys.

26:34.421 --> 26:35.556
The best of us.

26:35.644 --> 26:39.065
And you are... just as much
a part of me as this baby!

26:39.122 --> 26:40.825
Enough of this bullshit.

26:41.387 --> 26:42.970
- Let me go!
- You can do this!

26:43.016 --> 26:44.714
- No! I can't!
- You have to!

26:46.354 --> 26:47.890
NO! Wynonna!

26:48.680 --> 26:50.471
Hey you, asshole!

26:50.526 --> 26:52.562
We need your help. We need you to work.

26:52.665 --> 26:55.013
We need you to get in the goddamn game!

26:57.953 --> 27:00.067
For the record, I really liked you.

27:00.121 --> 27:02.589
PEACEMAKER!

27:09.693 --> 27:10.910
Good for you.

27:12.602 --> 27:13.988
Wait, wait!

27:14.650 --> 27:15.924
Wow! Nice gun.

27:15.987 --> 27:17.888
Ow! Make up your mind.

27:17.923 --> 27:19.555
Waverly! It's coming!

27:19.587 --> 27:21.007
What?! Now?!

27:21.080 --> 27:22.048
Hold my hand!

27:26.470 --> 27:28.157
NUTS, he got Keith.

27:28.276 --> 27:31.290
You're still outnumbered, Xavier. How
long do you think you can keep this up?

27:31.325 --> 27:32.989
I'll die before you hurt her.

27:33.043 --> 27:35.628
You know better than anyone
what the right training can do.

27:35.709 --> 27:37.613
But you gotta start early.

27:37.692 --> 27:38.900
Shut up!

27:38.933 --> 27:40.550
An Earp and a Holliday?

27:40.665 --> 27:43.267
It's gonna be a demon-fighting machine.

27:43.337 --> 27:44.973
But not if Wynonna keeps it.

27:45.005 --> 27:46.768
She's only gonna screw it up.

27:46.867 --> 27:48.373
Hell, she corrupted you.

27:48.446 --> 27:50.309
You won't live to see that baby!

27:50.344 --> 27:53.624
Oh Xavier, you used to follow the rules.

27:53.671 --> 27:56.653
We'll raise it well. We'll
teach it the proper values.

28:00.087 --> 28:03.023
YOUR "VALUES" CAN BURN!

28:11.930 --> 28:13.166
No, no, no.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.863
Bad move, Junior.

28:15.966 --> 28:17.610
You have metal in you.

28:18.841 --> 28:21.627
- Lots of metal.
- It was a car accident. I was 11.

28:21.676 --> 28:23.561
So you're no stranger to pain, then.

28:23.610 --> 28:25.445
You're the one who's gonna... pain.

28:25.479 --> 28:28.141
I'm gonna rip that gun out of your hand...

28:29.090 --> 28:32.137
...and make you beg for mercy.

28:32.552 --> 28:35.604
You hurt my friend. And it's
made of plastic, asshole!

28:43.263 --> 28:44.265
This...

28:44.531 --> 28:46.400
is for threatening Waverly.

28:47.434 --> 28:49.104
This...

28:49.403 --> 28:51.309
This is for betraying Wyatt.

28:51.926 --> 28:53.141
And this...

28:54.021 --> 28:57.964
That was for leaving me
in that godforsaken well.

28:58.042 --> 29:00.921
You may be able to move metal...

29:03.184 --> 29:06.265
...but you cannot move yourself.

29:10.109 --> 29:13.240
How can anything have
fingernails this small?

29:13.761 --> 29:15.430
It's ridiculous.

29:16.597 --> 29:17.999
You did it.

29:18.353 --> 29:19.388
We did it.

29:22.872 --> 29:24.832
Do you think everything's OK?

29:24.908 --> 29:25.876
Just look.

29:26.635 --> 29:28.170
Pure perfection.

29:30.578 --> 29:31.862
The revenants.

29:32.834 --> 29:34.303
I'm the Earp heir.

29:35.042 --> 29:36.684
They're always coming for me...

29:38.460 --> 29:40.096
and everything I love.

29:42.322 --> 29:43.795
I don't want to.

29:45.626 --> 29:48.959
I didn't realize how
much I wouldn't want to...

29:52.557 --> 29:55.010
You're the coolest thing I ever did.

29:58.837 --> 30:01.095
You're gonna have it much better than me.

30:01.502 --> 30:03.233
I promise you that.

30:07.355 --> 30:08.741
Shh.

30:12.803 --> 30:13.805
No...

30:14.380 --> 30:16.116
You have to go. Quick!

30:16.729 --> 30:18.364
Nicole's at the getaway car.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.089
And those knob gobblers?

30:23.689 --> 30:26.430
I got throbbing lady
bits and a rage to match.

30:26.792 --> 30:28.092
They're doomed.

30:28.840 --> 30:29.877
Waverly?

30:30.528 --> 30:31.923
Shh.

30:31.971 --> 30:34.374
And make sure he gets
a moment with the baby.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.702
You're wrong, Wynonna.

30:38.101 --> 30:39.507
You're the best of us.

30:41.450 --> 30:42.486
Go...

30:57.715 --> 30:59.317
Are you sure about this?

30:59.391 --> 31:00.759
We have to know.

31:01.192 --> 31:02.194
Both of us.

31:14.663 --> 31:17.388
OK, so if the baby starts screaming or...

31:17.476 --> 31:19.820
I start... to burn,

31:20.478 --> 31:22.286
get us over the line. Fast. OK?

31:22.356 --> 31:24.417
OK. I got you, Waves.

31:46.478 --> 31:48.114
Hey!

31:52.802 --> 31:54.651
The baby's Doc's.

31:55.585 --> 31:57.693
And I don't have revenant blood.

31:58.750 --> 32:00.069
Bobo lied to me.

32:00.556 --> 32:02.428
What about the DNA test?

32:03.474 --> 32:05.610
OK, so I'm not an Earp either.

32:07.218 --> 32:09.266
Nicole... what am I?

32:09.369 --> 32:10.742
That's easy.

32:10.863 --> 32:13.732
You are extraordinary.

32:21.822 --> 32:22.791
Come on.

32:24.375 --> 32:25.828
Hey, so, how's that divorce comin' along?

32:25.888 --> 32:27.624
Ha ha, yeah, I'm on it.

32:30.915 --> 32:32.634
- Woohoo!
- Baby!

32:32.704 --> 32:36.221
Thanks for deliverin' our package, Earp.

32:36.255 --> 32:37.389
Please don't hurt us.

32:37.475 --> 32:39.425
And don't ever cross a mother.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.560
CRAP!

32:44.596 --> 32:46.895
I'm with you, Earp.

32:57.050 --> 33:00.564
Where's the baby?

33:00.631 --> 33:02.386
Somewhere you'll never find it,

33:02.453 --> 33:04.329
outside the Ghost River Triangle.

33:04.438 --> 33:06.039
It's never coming back.

33:06.933 --> 33:08.554
And neither are you.

33:11.859 --> 33:14.375
- That metal won't hold him for long.
- OK, yeah.

33:14.434 --> 33:16.270
OK, I'll stand guard.

33:16.718 --> 33:18.172
Besides, you need to go.

33:18.206 --> 33:20.071
Now. Wynonna needs you to meet the baby.

33:20.106 --> 33:22.452
WayHaught is taking it
to the rendezvous point.

33:22.523 --> 33:24.570
- WayHaught?
- Here are the GPS co-ordinates.

33:24.660 --> 33:27.873
- How do you know this?
- I told you, I was in an accident.

33:28.807 --> 33:31.598
I wasn't recruited to Black Badge
for my excellent Seinfeld impressions.

33:31.672 --> 33:35.499
Though they are really excellent and
you should hear some of them. George!

33:35.561 --> 33:36.587
Jeremy.

33:37.782 --> 33:38.617
Thank you.

33:39.785 --> 33:41.886
Get out of here, you gorgeous idiot!

33:42.186 --> 33:43.511
You gotta see your kid.

33:43.855 --> 33:45.296
At least once.

33:45.372 --> 33:46.539
Ah...

33:47.060 --> 33:49.569
Don't even think about it, Platinum Blonde.

33:59.901 --> 34:01.154
Black Badge?

34:22.827 --> 34:24.018
It's Perry.

34:27.978 --> 34:30.202
Best private security money can buy.

34:30.402 --> 34:32.565
I even brought a wet nurse.

34:32.683 --> 34:35.138
Did you guys know a wet
nurse is still a thing?

34:35.199 --> 34:36.991
You're a good man, Perry Crofte.

34:37.062 --> 34:39.161
And still alive, thanks to Wynonna.

34:39.221 --> 34:41.032
This is really the least I could do.

34:41.094 --> 34:43.274
Her good deeds are finally paying off.

34:43.344 --> 34:44.578
Hey, we should get going.

34:44.647 --> 34:45.858
Just to be safe.

34:46.648 --> 34:48.588
- Wait, wait. Sh, sh.
- I got it.

34:48.630 --> 34:49.966
You need to say goodbye.

34:50.994 --> 34:52.047
Not me.

34:57.862 --> 34:59.331
Here.

35:09.364 --> 35:11.631
Dainty and delicate in blue.

35:13.348 --> 35:14.834
Where are you taking her?

35:15.143 --> 35:18.322
As far away from the Ghost
River Triangle as she can get.

35:21.619 --> 35:23.256
Aunt Gus is waiting.

35:28.163 --> 35:29.871
Goodbye, little girl.

36:13.949 --> 36:15.202
You OK?

36:16.219 --> 36:17.896
- Dolls?
- Yeah?

36:18.296 --> 36:19.796
Do you think they made it?

36:33.267 --> 36:34.714
I know they did.

36:39.535 --> 36:41.616
They're coming for your baby.

36:41.676 --> 36:43.040
The baby is gone.

36:43.099 --> 36:44.626
And Bulshar...

36:44.934 --> 36:46.953
is coming for my angel.

36:47.037 --> 36:49.441
Waverly is not your daughter.

36:50.149 --> 36:52.542
She crossed the line without injury.

36:53.195 --> 36:55.778
I never said she was my daughter.

36:55.835 --> 36:57.371
Just that she was kin.

36:57.428 --> 36:59.173
You will remain here

36:59.258 --> 37:01.452
until the Earps are done with you.

37:02.334 --> 37:05.083
You don't think I can
handle being stuck in a well?

37:05.176 --> 37:06.651
I've been in Hell.

37:06.722 --> 37:08.260
So have I.

37:12.081 --> 37:14.849
When Dolls shot me and I died...

37:15.452 --> 37:17.064
that's where I went.

37:18.020 --> 37:19.131
Hell.

37:19.614 --> 37:21.302
With all the others.

37:22.666 --> 37:24.591
Fire and brimstone.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.126
The whole deal.

37:26.215 --> 37:27.769
Deep down, Doc...

37:28.255 --> 37:31.877
you have always been one of us.

37:32.368 --> 37:34.813
Your fate is sealed.

37:34.885 --> 37:36.121
Wyatt...

37:36.621 --> 37:38.139
buggered us both.

37:38.201 --> 37:39.738
You watch your mouth.

37:39.793 --> 37:40.894
And now...

37:41.456 --> 37:43.005
you're mortal.

37:44.256 --> 37:46.894
Oh, the irony.

37:48.415 --> 37:51.069
A seal for your tomb, Bobo.

37:53.361 --> 37:56.761
Only this one... is made of wood.

37:56.847 --> 37:58.630
Good luck moving that.

37:58.755 --> 38:01.237
Oh, you think you can end me, Doc?

38:01.471 --> 38:04.308
My master is coming,

38:04.493 --> 38:06.244
and there will be a reckoning!

38:06.300 --> 38:09.888
You hear me, Holliday? A RECKONING!

38:14.829 --> 38:16.032
You OK?

38:20.225 --> 38:21.352
Are you?

38:31.640 --> 38:33.216
You sent her away.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.906
Would you have done any different?

38:37.908 --> 38:40.551
I would have done everything different.

38:42.117 --> 38:44.643
The demon Clootie is still out there.

38:45.548 --> 38:47.296
Not Clootie, but Bulshar.

38:47.376 --> 38:49.366
Whatever his name is, we'll get him.

38:53.820 --> 38:56.431
We're gonna break this fucking curse, Doc.

38:57.672 --> 38:59.442
So she never has to.

39:01.588 --> 39:03.723
Did you give our daughter a name?

39:07.524 --> 39:10.292
Nobody looking for an
Earp will ever find her.

39:16.245 --> 39:18.150
But her first name is...

39:18.239 --> 39:19.241
Alice.

39:22.820 --> 39:24.523
Alice Michelle.

39:26.390 --> 39:28.260
After your mother. And mine.

39:32.903 --> 39:35.654
That's a fitting tribute
to those that have left.

39:37.133 --> 39:38.512
Left, yes.

39:43.293 --> 39:45.680
But Mama Earp is still waiting.

40:07.523 --> 40:09.893
<i>There are men, Wynonna,</i>

40:09.983 --> 40:11.885
<i>mean as a rattlesnake,</i>

40:11.920 --> 40:13.593
<i>cornered at dusk.</i>

40:31.821 --> 40:33.839
<i>And there are demons...</i>

40:35.919 --> 40:38.331
<i>...sweet as clover honey.</i>

40:59.613 --> 41:01.582
<i>And then there's him.</i>

41:55.881 --> 41:58.054
<i>I told you he was real.</i>

41:58.132 --> 42:00.326
<i>I never stopped believing.</i>

42:07.676 --> 42:10.639
<i>But he will rise.</i>

42:10.724 --> 42:12.396
<i>And when he does...</i>

42:25.221 --> 42:27.297
<i>...you'll believe it, too.</i>

42:27.830 --> 42:29.799
Fine. You were right.

42:29.925 --> 42:31.428
Bulshar's back.

42:32.032 --> 42:33.930
Now, what do we do about it?

42:35.246 --> 42:36.382
Mama?
