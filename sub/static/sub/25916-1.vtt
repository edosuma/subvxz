[sighs] Look at this cake.

14:59.189 --> 15:02.026
It's not even about me.
It's about the stupid alliance.

15:02.109 --> 15:05.321
Shame you're a princess and too dainty
to do anything about it.

15:09.199 --> 15:10.034
[door opens]

15:10.534 --> 15:14.204
I think you'll be very pleased
with the revised cake, Your Highness.

15:15.956 --> 15:19.168
Nice likeness. Competent latticework.

15:19.251 --> 15:23.088
Moving down, sugar columns
seem structurally sound.

15:23.172 --> 15:27.968
Back looks good. And just a cursory glance
at the bottom tier.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.219
And it says...

15:29.303 --> 15:31.221
"Get Bent, Dad."

15:31.305 --> 15:33.057
Isn't that... What?

15:33.641 --> 15:35.017
Bean!

15:37.019 --> 15:38.020
[both laughing]

15:40.022 --> 15:43.984
[Elfo] Caramel can be a coating,
a filling, or a candy unto itself.

15:44.068 --> 15:47.446
Now, a cousin to caramel is nougat,
which essentially is--

15:50.699 --> 15:51.533
[grunts]

15:53.786 --> 15:54.620
[plays melody]

15:58.707 --> 16:01.627
Oh. Hi, I'm Elfo. And you are?

16:01.710 --> 16:03.504
Busy. We're at war here.

16:03.587 --> 16:04.505
What's war?

16:04.588 --> 16:05.422
[whistles]

16:08.008 --> 16:09.176
[stomping]

16:09.259 --> 16:11.261
[growling]

16:13.055 --> 16:14.431
Wee!

16:14.515 --> 16:16.392
Now we're meeting new people. [grunts]

16:20.229 --> 16:21.397
Yikes.

16:22.356 --> 16:23.190
Huh?

16:23.857 --> 16:24.733
[shrieks]

16:35.160 --> 16:35.995
[screams]

16:38.747 --> 16:40.207
[gnomes yelling]

16:44.378 --> 16:45.796
Hi, I'm Elfo.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.677
Yeow!

16:57.266 --> 17:01.270
Well, I like war,
but I wouldn't say I love it.

17:03.605 --> 17:04.606
[coins jingling]

17:21.290 --> 17:22.124
Wha...

17:22.207 --> 17:23.459
Ooh. [chuckles]

17:23.542 --> 17:25.961
-I'm glad you can't see this. Bye!
-Huh?

17:26.754 --> 17:27.588
[ogre groans]

17:31.967 --> 17:33.260
-Oh!
-Ah!

17:33.343 --> 17:36.430
Tonight is wedding night,
so is time we had talk.

17:36.513 --> 17:39.516
-I know I am not your mother.
-Please don't.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.895
-But I do have sex with your father.
-God, Oona. Ew.

17:42.978 --> 17:45.898
I do not need a sex talk
from my stepmother.

17:45.981 --> 17:49.777
Tonight, you will be expect
to perform your wifely duties.

17:49.860 --> 17:53.197
I mention because it was difficult
for me with the tentacles.

17:53.280 --> 17:54.615
I don't have tentacles.

17:54.698 --> 17:56.950
Your husband will have tentacles.

17:57.034 --> 17:59.119
Are you trying to say testicles?

17:59.203 --> 18:03.290
I don't know. Just leave your eggs
on the nightstand and get out of there.

18:04.041 --> 18:04.875
[bell tolling]

18:07.419 --> 18:08.462
Hmm.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.224
[shrieking]

18:22.309 --> 18:24.061
Man, I'm starving.

18:24.144 --> 18:27.231
I should've grabbed one of those gumdrops
when they were hanging me.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.364
I'm Elfo, by the way. What's your name?

18:35.447 --> 18:37.032
We are but humble people.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.493
We have no names,
but you can call me Farmer.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.286
Our food is not flavorful,

18:41.370 --> 18:43.664
but we humbly offer it
for your sustenance.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.208
Are you kidding me?
This stuff looks amazing.

18:46.291 --> 18:47.835
All I've ever eaten is candy.

18:47.918 --> 18:50.003
Candy? Are you a king?

18:50.087 --> 18:51.421
[scoffs] No.

18:51.922 --> 18:53.757
Mmm. Mmm! Oh!

18:53.841 --> 18:56.510
I am sorry our food will bring you no joy.

18:56.593 --> 18:57.678
This is delicious!

18:57.761 --> 19:01.014
I beg you, sir.
We are far too humble to receive praise.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.475
I can't help it. You deserve praise.

19:03.559 --> 19:07.104
-We deserve to be beaten with our food.
-[laughs] I would rather eat it.

19:07.187 --> 19:11.525
-It's so incredibly good!
-Now you've praised us too far.

19:11.608 --> 19:14.361
-You must leave our humble home!
-Get out, praiser.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.157
Thanks again! It was delicious!

19:18.240 --> 19:20.159
You're ruining our lives!

19:29.751 --> 19:32.921
[man] Announcing King Zog,
Queen Oona and... Who cares?

19:37.050 --> 19:38.427
What do you see?

19:38.510 --> 19:41.054
Ooh! Everybody got shoes.

19:43.182 --> 19:47.394
How long is this gonna last? [shudders]
I'm not exactly comfortable in a church.

19:47.477 --> 19:48.312
[shudders]

19:50.647 --> 19:52.107
That's communion wine.

19:54.526 --> 19:56.987
-You could use some, though.
-I really shouldn't.

19:57.070 --> 20:01.033
Times when you really shouldn't
are exactly when you really should.

20:04.620 --> 20:09.082
Drinking wine with a demon.
Not exactly the wedding day I wished for.

20:13.295 --> 20:14.129
[snorts]

20:16.632 --> 20:17.466
Hmm!

20:22.721 --> 20:24.932
I'm supposed to be surrounded
by people I like.

20:25.015 --> 20:26.600
I don't even have my real mother.

20:28.936 --> 20:31.271
Who needs a mother
when you've got bridesmaids?

20:31.772 --> 20:33.315
-No bridesmaids?
-No.

20:33.398 --> 20:34.858
-How about friends?
-Uh-uh.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.276
Only drinking buddies.

20:37.110 --> 20:38.278
To drinking buddies.

20:38.362 --> 20:40.948
Better than bridesmaids.
Better than mothers.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.951
I was raised
by a pack of drinking buddies.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.454
And I came out perfect.

20:49.790 --> 20:54.878
Dearly beloved, as we stand here
in this overly large building,

20:54.962 --> 20:57.673
designed to make us feel small
and inadequate,

20:57.756 --> 21:00.884
we ask the invisible God
we think is up there,

21:00.968 --> 21:03.845
to watch over us if He, She,

21:03.929 --> 21:07.766
or It is even capable of things
like watching over us...

21:07.849 --> 21:10.394
This religion is still
in its early stages.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.145
Nobody knows anything for sure,

21:12.229 --> 21:17.651
but if I talk with confidence,
you dopes will believe anything I say.

21:18.986 --> 21:20.195
[both laughing]

21:20.279 --> 21:21.321
Whoa! Pops.

21:21.405 --> 21:25.534
[stammering] I'm just kicking back
with my new cat.

21:25.617 --> 21:28.620
Me? Ow. Meow. That's what cats say, right?

21:28.704 --> 21:30.455
I'm not here to answer cat questions.

21:30.539 --> 21:31.373
[Luci grunts]

21:31.456 --> 21:34.001
Now get up and make your dad proud,
you drunk.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.880
-Are you trying to make a jerk out of me?
-Yes.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.098
Wow!

21:48.181 --> 21:49.975
It's so small.

21:50.475 --> 21:52.728
[chuckles] Oh, wait, I'm far away.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.065
[organ music playing]

21:58.817 --> 22:02.696
Do you, Guysbert,
most Exalted Prince of Bentwood,

22:02.779 --> 22:04.156
Slayer of Metallica,

22:04.239 --> 22:08.118
take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

22:08.201 --> 22:09.786
Duh...

22:09.870 --> 22:10.912
Okay.

22:10.996 --> 22:14.666
And do you, Princess Tiabeanie,
a single woman,

22:14.750 --> 22:17.836
take this man
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

22:27.637 --> 22:28.930
No!

22:34.936 --> 22:35.771
Ah.

22:37.689 --> 22:38.857
[crowd gasps]

22:38.940 --> 22:41.568
[stammers] I didn't mean for that.
I'm so sorry.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.279
He's dead.

22:44.363 --> 22:48.658
Uh, I think I'm still alive.
No, wait. Nevermind.

22:48.742 --> 22:50.327
I want my gift back.

22:50.410 --> 22:53.288
Wait! Wait! Wait!
[stammers] Don't leave! Stab that guy.

22:56.666 --> 22:59.461
-This wedding is all messed up.
-We've got to save the alliance.

22:59.544 --> 23:01.338
-What are we gonna do?
-We've got another son.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.173
Why didn't you say so? What's his name?

23:03.256 --> 23:06.176
-[stammers] God... Uh, Merkimer.
-Merkimer.

23:06.259 --> 23:08.303
Okay, watch this. Here we go.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.847
Everybody, sit down. [chuckles]

23:10.931 --> 23:16.478
[clears throat] In consultation
with Guysbert's grieving parents,

23:16.561 --> 23:19.356
we've decided
the princess can still marry.

23:19.439 --> 23:20.357
What?

23:20.440 --> 23:23.068
Presenting Guysbert's younger brother,

23:23.151 --> 23:27.406
the new heir to the throne of Bentwood,
Prince Merkimer.

23:27.489 --> 23:28.615
Don't be sad.

23:28.698 --> 23:30.659
She would have left him for me anyway.

23:30.742 --> 23:35.205
Uh... Actually, I'd be fine if someone
could just slide my head up a bit.

23:35.288 --> 23:37.707
Hush! There's a wedding in progress.

23:38.792 --> 23:41.962
Do you, Prince Merkimer of Bentwood--

23:42.045 --> 23:44.297
You gotta be kidding me.
Father, you can't make me--

23:44.381 --> 23:46.216
The king can make anyone!

23:46.299 --> 23:48.301
You do. You do.

23:48.969 --> 23:50.303
Say "man and wife."

23:50.387 --> 23:52.806
I now pronounce you man and--

23:52.889 --> 23:54.641
-[door creaks open]
-[crowd gasps]

23:55.267 --> 23:58.395
Uh... Hi, I'm Elfo. [chuckles]

23:58.478 --> 24:00.021
What are all your names?

24:00.105 --> 24:01.273
What the hell is that?

24:01.356 --> 24:03.191
-An elf.
-A magical elf.

24:03.275 --> 24:05.694
Elves haven't been seen in centuries.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.571
Imagine the possibilities.

24:07.654 --> 24:11.241
With elf magic,
I could progress far beyond card tricks.

24:11.783 --> 24:12.617
[whimpers]

24:12.701 --> 24:16.163
A shiny gold Zog
to whoever seizes the elf.

24:16.246 --> 24:17.581
[chattering and clambering]

24:17.664 --> 24:18.748
[Elfo screams]

24:20.709 --> 24:22.669
Oh, I'll get you, wee elf!

24:22.752 --> 24:23.795
[rapid thumping]

24:23.879 --> 24:24.713
Oh!

24:25.630 --> 24:26.465
Ah!

24:38.810 --> 24:39.895
[inhales deeply] Ah!

24:40.979 --> 24:41.980
[grunting]

24:44.691 --> 24:45.692
[fabric tearing]

24:45.775 --> 24:46.735
Whoa! [grunts]

24:47.986 --> 24:49.070
[Elfo screams]

24:52.449 --> 24:53.408
So how'd it go?

24:56.161 --> 24:57.621
That good, huh?

24:59.414 --> 25:03.460
The wedding is ruined.
The demon is performing exquisitely.

25:03.543 --> 25:08.507
But look. There's a complication.
They've been joined by a tiny dork.

25:08.590 --> 25:09.424
Ow.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.801
It's fire, Cloyd. It's hot.

25:11.885 --> 25:14.346
I know. I was there.

25:17.265 --> 25:20.393
Elfo has left the building with Bean.

25:20.477 --> 25:24.356
No worry. I'm an expert hunter,
and I'll track down the woman I love.

25:24.439 --> 25:25.899
Keep the champagne chilled.

25:25.982 --> 25:28.735
I shall return
before the last uncle passes out.

25:28.818 --> 25:32.405
My Knights of the Zog Table will aid you.
Knights!

25:33.907 --> 25:36.576
Pendergast, who are your best trackers?

25:36.660 --> 25:38.954
That would be Stryker and Bolt, sire.

25:39.037 --> 25:42.040
But they're lost,
so, it'll be Turbish and Mertz.

25:43.124 --> 25:45.377
We won't get tired this time.

25:48.713 --> 25:49.881
[horses neighing]

25:56.388 --> 25:57.222
[crown clangs]

26:02.561 --> 26:03.395
[Elfo grunts]

26:06.147 --> 26:09.859
It was sweet of you to wreck my wedding,
but you're kind of slowing us down.

26:09.943 --> 26:11.278
Mind if I give you a ride?

26:11.361 --> 26:13.405
Mind? I don't mind at all.

26:13.488 --> 26:14.656
[inhales]

26:14.739 --> 26:16.533
[exhales]

26:24.124 --> 26:28.295
Well, it took all day,
but I finally got my winnings--

26:28.378 --> 26:29.879
-[grunts]
-[crowd exclaims]

26:37.012 --> 26:38.638
[Bean] Oh, no.

26:40.807 --> 26:42.434
Stand back, chumps.

26:42.517 --> 26:45.145
Watch as a non-chump chumps these chumps.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.064
[inhales]

26:54.738 --> 26:55.572
[Merkimer grunts]

26:55.655 --> 26:57.324
[horse neighs]

26:59.576 --> 27:00.827
[Luci laughs]

27:01.745 --> 27:03.371
[knights grunting]

27:04.623 --> 27:07.375
Before today,
we had neither riches nor magic.

27:07.459 --> 27:12.130
Then today, for one blessed second,
we almost had both.

27:12.213 --> 27:13.882
And now you got bupkis!

27:15.425 --> 27:16.885
Oh, no.

27:25.226 --> 27:26.227
[Elfo screams]

27:26.311 --> 27:27.228
[Bean screams]

27:28.063 --> 27:29.856
-[Luci] Ow, ow, ow!
-[Bean grunting]

27:29.939 --> 27:31.316
[grunting and screaming]

27:31.399 --> 27:32.901
Ow, ow, ow!

27:32.984 --> 27:34.402
Oh! Ah! [grunts]

27:34.486 --> 27:35.487
Why me?

27:38.990 --> 27:41.451
[Pendergast] No one could survive
that many tumbles.

27:41.534 --> 27:43.411
-[laughing]
-[Pendergast] Oh.

28:00.303 --> 28:01.137
[owl hoots]

28:01.221 --> 28:04.683
I've never had a nightmare. Is this one?

28:04.766 --> 28:05.767
[distant trumpeting]

28:13.525 --> 28:15.610
[Pendergast] The footprints
stop dead right here.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.613
-Where did they go?
-Only one place they could have gone.

28:18.697 --> 28:19.864
Start digging.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.200
[Turbish] I have theory. Maybe they go up.

28:22.283 --> 28:25.495
I won't even dignify that
with an upward glance.

28:25.578 --> 28:26.413
[Turbish] Ugh.

28:31.376 --> 28:32.669
[fairy] Hey, there.

28:32.752 --> 28:36.339
I haven't seen you in this tree before.
You looking for a good time?

28:36.423 --> 28:39.676
A fairy? Maybe she can help us.
Do you do magic?

28:39.759 --> 28:43.179
Sure, I've done a trick or two.
What do you have in mind?

28:43.263 --> 28:46.516
I was forced into a wedding,
and I wish I had my freedom to--

28:46.599 --> 28:48.601
Hey, I'm gonna stop you right there.

28:48.685 --> 28:51.354
Wishes sound free. I don't do free.

28:51.438 --> 28:55.024
But you look like sweet kids.
You ever heard of the Wishmaster?

28:55.108 --> 28:56.735
I've never heard of anything.

28:56.818 --> 28:59.028
It's true. He just thinks
you're a real friendly lady.

28:59.112 --> 29:01.614
An old girlfriend of mine
used to work the mountain.

29:01.698 --> 29:05.785
She said this Wishmaster guy
was the real deal. Thataway.

29:05.869 --> 29:09.122
This is so helpful.
How can we ever repay you?

29:09.205 --> 29:11.374
Cash. Leave it on the branch.

29:18.548 --> 29:19.382
[chirps]

29:22.761 --> 29:23.678
[Luci sighs]

29:23.762 --> 29:26.806
Cool night air, sky full of stars...

29:27.390 --> 29:29.225
This sucks. How much further?

29:29.309 --> 29:30.143
[grunts]

29:32.103 --> 29:34.230
It's getting late, boys.
We'd better stay here.

29:41.237 --> 29:42.822
Okay, so if we get three wishes,

29:42.906 --> 29:45.575
I want to be in charge of my own destiny,

29:45.658 --> 29:47.202
to have my mom back, obviously,

29:47.285 --> 29:49.704
and to find a boyfriend
who's a great listener.

29:49.788 --> 29:51.122
What do you wish for, Elfo?

29:51.206 --> 29:52.415
To be a great listener.

29:52.499 --> 29:55.418
And whatever that thing is
you said about your mom.

29:55.502 --> 29:58.838
I would get rid of all the diseases
plaguing mankind,

29:58.922 --> 30:01.007
and replace them with worse ones.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.842
Ooh! And make Elfo die alone.

30:02.926 --> 30:06.221
Hey, he's making fun of my dreams.

30:06.304 --> 30:08.097
That's what friends do.

30:08.181 --> 30:11.601
We got a long journey in the morning.
Let's get some shut-eye.

30:11.684 --> 30:14.687
You two sleep down by my feet.
I call it the friend zone.

30:14.771 --> 30:17.315
Get comfortable.
You ain't never getting outta here.

30:18.441 --> 30:21.486
What's this weird feeling
I don't want to drink away?

30:21.569 --> 30:23.446
That's hope. That's hope!

30:23.530 --> 30:26.241
You know what we say in Hell?
"Hope's for dopes."

30:26.324 --> 30:28.368
Well, good night, everybody. [grunts]

30:28.993 --> 30:32.247
I'll be entering your dreams
tonight in the form of a laughing skull.

30:32.330 --> 30:37.377
[chuckles] Yeah, that's me. That's me.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry about that.

30:44.467 --> 30:47.971
An elf with a human girl?
That ain't right.

30:57.772 --> 30:58.773
[Oona snoring]

31:01.609 --> 31:02.443
Ah...

31:05.363 --> 31:06.197
[snores]

31:07.782 --> 31:08.616
[Luci snores]

31:08.700 --> 31:11.494
Mmm... Guys, hey! Wake up.

31:11.578 --> 31:15.039
Come on. We've got a long way to go
to the Wishmaster's lair.

31:15.123 --> 31:16.082
[Elfo] Mmm...

31:16.624 --> 31:17.458
Oh.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.799
I wish you guys would help.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.259
Save it for the Wishmaster.

31:40.607 --> 31:42.609
[distant vocalizing]

31:51.117 --> 31:52.368
Seek ye me?

31:52.452 --> 31:54.120
Yes, are you--

31:54.203 --> 31:55.622
The Washmaster.

31:55.705 --> 31:57.457
Wait, the what-master?

31:57.540 --> 31:59.250
You heard me. The Washmaster.

31:59.334 --> 32:03.087
People far and wide seek me out
to wash their clothes.

32:06.549 --> 32:07.717
No!

32:07.800 --> 32:11.220
Well, now we know something
we didn't know yesterday.

32:11.971 --> 32:12.805
[horse neighs]

32:13.765 --> 32:14.766
[Bean sighs]

32:15.808 --> 32:20.146
Ah, there you are, my love.
I've come to take you back to our wedding.

32:20.229 --> 32:21.230
[panting]

32:46.631 --> 32:47.465
[Bean] Oh!

32:49.092 --> 32:49.926
[sniffs]

32:59.894 --> 33:00.728
Ah!

33:04.941 --> 33:06.818
I might as well give up and accept

33:06.901 --> 33:09.028
that I'll never be anything more
than a wealthy queen

33:09.112 --> 33:11.698
of a fabulous faraway kingdom. [sniffles]

33:12.573 --> 33:13.700
It's my destiny.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.284
Bean, no!

33:15.368 --> 33:18.705
You are beautiful,
and your skin is so soft,

33:18.788 --> 33:21.791
and your hair smells like butterscotch,
but you're wrong!

33:21.874 --> 33:25.378
Pardon my language,
but destiny is baloney!

33:25.461 --> 33:28.715
Your future is not foretold.
It's what you make of it.

33:28.798 --> 33:30.299
[Merkimer] He's right, my darling.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.884
Let's make a future together.

33:31.968 --> 33:35.096
I've loved you
since the moment you killed my brother.

33:38.891 --> 33:41.436
Give me your hand in marriage, Bean.

33:52.447 --> 33:53.448
Ah...

33:53.531 --> 33:55.742
-You're magic, right?
-Yep.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.453
Not that kind of magic, though.

33:58.536 --> 34:01.289
-What about you?
-Maybe I am.

34:02.206 --> 34:03.041
Nope.

34:03.124 --> 34:04.125
[all screaming]

34:06.335 --> 34:08.337
[theme music playing]
