- Hey, nice to see you.

09:00.667 --> 09:03.902
Thank you for coming in.
We have a response.

09:03.903 --> 09:06.884
I think we've made some real progress here.

09:12.317 --> 09:15.312
I'm sorry. Were there some
last-minute changes here?

09:15.313 --> 09:17.014
Not really. I've just filled in the blanks

09:17.015 --> 09:20.610
on a couple of things.

09:20.611 --> 09:23.328
Page five, it reads, "In the event of a"...

09:25.597 --> 09:27.106
Please take your time reading.

09:27.107 --> 09:29.336
It's okay. I've read it.

09:29.337 --> 09:31.517
You see we've upped the base
salary for incoming musicians.

09:31.518 --> 09:33.051
We've compromised on the tenure issue.

09:33.052 --> 09:35.568
There's been zero movement
on pension or health

09:35.569 --> 09:37.534
and zero cost-of-living increases.

09:37.535 --> 09:38.996
Given the underlying economics...

09:38.997 --> 09:40.746
The underlying economics
are that you are right now

09:40.747 --> 09:43.479
soliciting massive donations
for a new symphony hall,

09:43.480 --> 09:45.085
while kicking your orchestra to the curb.

09:45.086 --> 09:48.010
No, no, no. One thing has
nothing to do with the other.

09:48.011 --> 09:50.054
Are you intending on having a symphony

09:50.055 --> 09:51.564
in your symphony hall?

09:51.565 --> 09:53.745
I really think you should
read this more carefully.

09:53.746 --> 09:56.358
I think we should all
read this more carefully.

09:56.359 --> 09:58.372
Have you not read this, Ms. Windsor?

09:58.373 --> 10:01.248
Can we have a show of hands,
how many members of management

10:01.249 --> 10:04.580

10:04.581 --> 10:05.707
My guess is you've read it.

10:05.708 --> 10:07.625
You're overstepping, sweet petunia.

10:07.626 --> 10:09.423
I'm neither sweet nor a petunia,

10:09.424 --> 10:10.717

10:15.441 --> 10:17.501
Roger, you're in no
position to tell any musician

10:17.502 --> 10:20.450
when he can and cannot
play, not without a contract.

10:20.451 --> 10:21.720
That's really very annoying.

10:21.721 --> 10:23.278
I'm sorry.

10:23.279 --> 10:24.932

me the fucking death stare.

is overtaking me too.

I can really control it.

You're insane. That was a disaster.

10:59.165 --> 11:00.195
No, it was perfect.

11:00.196 --> 11:01.345
The disaster was when they

11:01.346 --> 11:02.448
presented us with the contract.

11:02.449 --> 11:03.958
The rest of it was perfect...

11:03.959 --> 11:05.828
only we needed some strings.
