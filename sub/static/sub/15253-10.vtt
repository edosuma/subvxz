WEBVTT

00:00.990 --> 00:02.533
and here are a few things
you might need to know.

00:02.534 --> 00:04.434
My dad must have left this for me.

00:08.267 --> 00:10.032
Oh my God! I didn't think you could top

00:10.033 --> 00:12.167
abandoning me for the last 20 years...

00:12.234 --> 00:13.700
<i>and then you shot me.</i>

00:13.701 --> 00:17.501
<i>Sarah, my mom did something to
me with that device.</i>

00:17.567 --> 00:19.701
My name is Alexei Volkoff.

00:19.767 --> 00:21.667
I believe you were looking for me.

00:23.601 --> 00:25.567
Sarah, I can't flash. The Intersect is gone.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074

00:47.033 --> 00:50.067
You wanted to see me, Alexei.

00:50.133 --> 00:53.701
I've just had some disturbing news.

00:53.767 --> 00:57.634
Agent Carmichael is still alive.

00:59.567 --> 01:01.366
I'm as surprised as you are.

01:01.367 --> 01:03.434
I was there.

01:03.501 --> 01:06.267
We tied them up...

01:06.334 --> 01:08.868
planted explosives all around them...

01:08.934 --> 01:12.067
and yet, he survived.

01:17.968 --> 01:19.868
It was my fault.

01:20.133 --> 01:22.033
I underestimated him.

01:22.834 --> 01:25.167
Let's tidy things up.

01:25.234 --> 01:28.067
I'm assigning you my top assassins:

01:28.133 --> 01:30.634
Pierre, Victor, Hercule.

01:30.701 --> 01:32.601
Use them.

01:36.200 --> 01:39.501
And, Frost...

01:39.567 --> 01:43.567
make certain he's really dead this time.

01:46.234 --> 01:48.066
All right. Are you ready for this?

01:48.067 --> 01:49.533
You and me, locked and loaded,

01:49.534 --> 01:52.000
training for hand-to-hand combat.
Absolutely,

01:52.067 --> 01:54.501
but remember I had six
months of training in Prague.

01:54.601 --> 01:56.601
This is different now.
This is Chuck unplugged.

01:56.667 --> 01:58.934
Wow. It sounds kind of hard-core
when you say it like that.

01:59.000 --> 02:00.600
It's gonna be good. Honest, I'm-I'm mostly

02:00.601 --> 02:02.767
just scared about today, man. Black Friday?

02:02.834 --> 02:04.600
This is the scariest shopping day of the year.

02:04.601 --> 02:06.433
Many a Buy More manager
has fallen on this day.

02:06.434 --> 02:07.999
Hey! Hey, hey, buddy,
you're going to be just fine.

02:08.000 --> 02:09.199
We'll learn a few moves;
you'll get through it.

02:09.199 --> 02:11.467
All right, I'm pumped! I'm pump... hey!

02:11.534 --> 02:14.634
Let's go in there and kick some serious ass.

02:19.767 --> 02:21.099
All right, ladies.

02:21.100 --> 02:22.600
Let's grab a pole

02:22.601 --> 02:24.968
and make that booty clap.

02:25.033 --> 02:27.167
Morgan, what sort of
hand-to-hand combat class

02:27.234 --> 02:30.000
did you sign us up for? Strip kick.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.833
Yeah, it mixes the self-defense of Krav Maga

02:31.834 --> 02:33.767
with the intense core
workout of pole dancing.

02:35.300 --> 02:37.200
I saw an infomercial on it

02:39.033 --> 02:40.466
All right, ladies...

02:40.467 --> 02:42.367
kick!

02:43.400 --> 02:44.533
How's it going with you and Sarah?

02:44.534 --> 02:47.934
Any uh, progress on "el proposalito"?

02:48.000 --> 02:50.300
Well, I-I am working on something new. Duck!

02:52.167 --> 02:54.367
Whoo! But, uh, I'm keeping
it a little close to the st.

02:54.434 --> 02:56.066
What?! Are you serious?

02:56.067 --> 02:57.967
Ju... Chuck, I'm a-I'm a-
I'm a part-time spy,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.100
man, okay? I am a very,

03:00.167 --> 03:02.701
very serious keeper of secrets.

03:03.734 --> 03:05.634
Jump!

03:07.200 --> 03:09.234
Casey can never know about this. Never.

03:09.300 --> 03:12.200
<i>So how's the combat training going?</i>

03:12.267 --> 03:13.800
Well, Cinnamon's a tough instructor,

03:13.801 --> 03:15.767
but I'm picking things up
pretty quickly, I think.

03:15.834 --> 03:18.934
Well, I am just happy to have you back.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.800
Me, too. And you know what?

03:20.801 --> 03:22.333
It's the best I've felt in a long time.

03:22.334 --> 03:24.467
Good, good. I thought
you might still be upset

03:24.534 --> 03:26.567
after Ellie and Awesome
cancelled Thanksgiving dinner.

03:26.634 --> 03:28.333
What? No, no, no, of course not.

03:28.334 --> 03:29.666
They're doctors. It happens.

03:29.667 --> 03:32.868
Besides, tonight is our
annual leftover dinner.

03:32.934 --> 03:34.633
Just as delicious as Thanksgiving,

03:34.634 --> 03:36.701
without all the big-event stress.

03:39.467 --> 03:42.634
Remember, Frost wants them
killed at close range.

03:42.701 --> 03:45.000
No sound.

03:45.067 --> 03:47.000
I guess I was just a little worried,

03:47.067 --> 03:49.467
'cause holidays are for family time, and...

03:49.534 --> 03:51.467
with everything that
happened with your mother...

03:51.534 --> 03:53.434
Well, I think I've developed
a little perspective.

03:53.469 --> 03:55.467
I mean, I'm ready to put the past behind me.

03:55.534 --> 03:57.032
Really.

03:57.033 --> 03:59.100
Don't sound so skeptical, all right?

03:59.167 --> 04:01.032
If my mom were standing
in front of me right now,

04:01.033 --> 04:03.968
I honestly think I'd say, "All is forgiven,

04:04.033 --> 04:06.100
"and good luck being an evil bad guy."

04:07.734 --> 04:10.868
And, uh, speaking of looking
forward to the future...

04:12.334 --> 04:14.234
Chuck, get down!

04:18.801 --> 04:20.701
Wow. This stuff really works.

04:23.934 --> 04:25.934
Sarah, I can't handle these
guys without the Intersect.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.900
I've only got the one move.

04:29.567 --> 04:31.467
Uh, Sarah...

04:34.701 --> 04:36.601
What?

04:43.501 --> 04:44.867
Mom?

04:44.868 --> 04:47.133
Come with me if you want to live.

04:49.767 --> 04:53.734
Transcrypt by www.addic7ed.com

05:30.569 --> 05:32.469
Okay. Here we are safe.

05:32.759 --> 05:34.659
Now you can start answering
some of my questions.

05:34.694 --> 05:35.900
We can't stay here.

05:35.901 --> 05:37.433
Volkoff has contacts in the CIA.

05:37.434 --> 05:38.833
We have to move.

05:38.834 --> 05:40.633
We should believe you, because last time

05:40.634 --> 05:42.066
trusting you worked out so well.

05:42.067 --> 05:45.434
Chuck, I didn't want to
have to do the things I did.

05:45.501 --> 05:47.934
Most people's moms don't have
to explain to their kids

05:48.000 --> 05:50.133
why they shot them,
or tied them up and blew up

05:50.200 --> 05:51.233
their childhood home.

05:51.234 --> 05:52.833
I didn't have a choice.

05:52.834 --> 05:54.066
There's always a choice!

05:54.067 --> 05:55.566
You could choose to let me
know what your plan is.

05:55.567 --> 05:58.801
Chuck, maybe we can step outside for a second?

05:58.868 --> 06:00.968
We're running out of...

06:01.033 --> 06:03.200
No. You're not going anywhere.

06:03.267 --> 06:05.167
What happened to putting
the past behind you?

06:05.200 --> 06:07.133
She just pushes my buttons, you know?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.032
I mean, you want to be
able to trust your mom,

06:09.033 --> 06:10.766
not worry that she's gonna
shoot you in the face.

06:10.767 --> 06:12.667
Which is why you should stay
out of this interrogation.

06:12.702 --> 06:13.900
There is something that she's not telling us,

06:13.901 --> 06:15.066
and we're not going to get

06:15.067 --> 06:16.666
to the bottom of it with you in the room.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.567
Sarah, I'm perfectly capable of doing...

06:21.734 --> 06:23.132
<i>BIG MIKE: This is what</i>

06:23.133 --> 06:24.633
<i>a successful Black Friday looks like.</i>

06:24.634 --> 06:26.667
<i>You did it, son. I couldn't be prouder.</i>

06:26.734 --> 06:28.634
It was hairy there for a minute,

06:28.667 --> 06:30.801
but, like, we ran out of those
Bondesen 7G Smartphones.

06:30.868 --> 06:32.299
But you remembered what I taught you.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.200
No phone? Sell them a head spa.

06:34.234 --> 06:36.134
No head spa? Sell 'em a used phone.

06:37.434 --> 06:38.466
Now...

06:38.467 --> 06:39.967
I brought this for you.

06:39.968 --> 06:42.167
Really? Just think of this as

06:42.234 --> 06:44.567
my fatherly love... in the form of

06:44.634 --> 06:47.901
fresh meatballs smothered in marinara

06:47.968 --> 06:51.701
with gooey delicious
provolone melting all over.

06:51.767 --> 06:55.300
Wow. That is just a
terrible metaphor, you know,

06:55.367 --> 06:57.267
but I forgive yo 'cause it smells delicious.

06:57.334 --> 06:59.767
You deserve it. Hey, all right.

06:59.834 --> 07:01.333
I should go.

07:01.334 --> 07:03.501
I'm getting a little misty.

07:03.567 --> 07:05.701
Mmm. Yeah, okay.

07:15.567 --> 07:17.266
Excuse me!

07:17.267 --> 07:18.900
Can you help me?

07:18.901 --> 07:21.367
Oh, geez, I'm sorry, Miss.
We're-we're-wee closed.

07:21.434 --> 07:24.868
Well, I just want to buy o
of those 7G Smartphones.

07:24.934 --> 07:27.133
Completely sold out of those. Please!

07:27.234 --> 07:31.300
I'll do anything.
Uh, not that I'm not flattered,

07:31.367 --> 07:34.000
but who has two thumbs and is taken?

07:34.067 --> 07:35.233
Boom, This guy.

07:35.234 --> 07:37.134
Okay. Happy holidays.

07:44.267 --> 07:46.300
Okay.

07:46.367 --> 07:48.267
This is our finest plan yet, Jeffrey-

07:48.300 --> 07:49.533
smartphones that can also send

07:49.534 --> 07:51.032
and receive calls.

07:51.033 --> 07:53.567
I mean, people will do
anything for these bad boys.

07:53.634 --> 07:54.867
Who have you been talking to?

07:54.868 --> 07:55.900
No one, no one, no one.

07:55.901 --> 07:56.967
Stop being paranoid. Remember,

07:56.968 --> 07:59.334
this is not stealing.

07:59.400 --> 08:01.834
This is pre-buying with
funds at we do not have yet,

08:01.901 --> 08:05.400
which we will postpay when
we sell these phones on eBay.

08:05.467 --> 08:06.566
And then, my friend...

08:06.567 --> 08:08.467
Use the profits to make our sweet demo.

08:08.501 --> 08:10.401
Jeffster!

08:11.534 --> 08:13.801
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

08:13.868 --> 08:15.366
Stop. Listen. I'm going to go check

08:15.367 --> 08:16.633
to see if the coast is clear

08:16.634 --> 08:17.999
and then we'll move these puppies

08:18.000 --> 08:19.900
out of here. Right?

08:20.868 --> 08:24.267
Totally.

08:29.133 --> 08:32.100
Knock, knock. Brought some carrots.

08:32.167 --> 08:34.534
Rich in vitamin A and good
for retinal development.

08:34.601 --> 08:36.667
Thank you. We're starving.

08:36.734 --> 08:39.200
I bet. You've been working on
this nonstop since we found it.

08:39.267 --> 08:41.167
Figure anything out? Well, more or less.

08:41.200 --> 08:44.467
My dad left me a sort of... memory problem.

08:44.534 --> 08:46.266
He was using the brain to store data,

08:46.267 --> 08:48.334
but he was approaching it from
an engineer's perspective,

08:48.400 --> 08:50.534
and human memory works
differently than a computer.

08:50.601 --> 08:52.399
So... a few adjustments,

08:52.400 --> 08:54.634
and 36 hours of MRIs later...

08:54.701 --> 08:56.500
voila!

08:56.501 --> 08:58.166
Whoa, wait. Are you telling me

08:58.167 --> 09:00.501
you just solved the problem
that your dad left you?

09:00.567 --> 09:02.467
No, I solved it 20 minutes ago,

09:02.501 --> 09:05.834
and then suddenly his computer
just locked off. Look!

09:05.901 --> 09:08.467
"One or 11?"

09:08.534 --> 09:10.032
What does that mean?

09:10.033 --> 09:12.534
I tried putting in each of
the number I don't know.

09:12.601 --> 09:14.466
It's another mystery, courtesy of my dad.

09:14.467 --> 09:18.167
Why would he leave this for me?
Uh... brain scans?

09:18.234 --> 09:20.868
I mean, this is obviously spy-related.

09:22.467 --> 09:24.066
Maybe we should talk to Chuck.

09:24.067 --> 09:26.834
No. I don't want to give him any reason

09:26.901 --> 09:28.266
to get back into that life.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.700
What do you want to do?

09:29.701 --> 09:31.968
I don't know.

09:32.033 --> 09:33.867
Now, we know these men you shot

09:33.868 --> 09:35.199
were high-level Volkoff assassins.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.366
So what's your game here?

09:36.367 --> 09:39.234
I was ordered to use those
three to kill Chuck.

09:39.300 --> 09:42.868
I had to shoot them to save Chuck's life.

09:42.934 --> 09:46.234
Protecting him has always
been my number-one priority.

09:49.934 --> 09:52.734
Hello? Yeah, ask her how
disabling the Intersect

09:52.801 --> 09:55.601
is about protecting me.
Are we really gonna do this right now?

09:55.667 --> 09:56.933
I'm just saying if she's
all about protecting me,

09:56.934 --> 09:57.933
tell her to explain that.

09:57.934 --> 09:59.600
Fine.

09:59.601 --> 10:02.267
So how was shutting off the Intersect

10:02.334 --> 10:04.199
meant to protect Chuck?

10:04.234 --> 10:06.701
It was meant to stop him from following me.

10:10.467 --> 10:11.600
Yes.

10:11.601 --> 10:13.501
But then I went out on missions unprotected;

10:13.536 --> 10:14.833
she's made me even more vulnerable.

10:14.834 --> 10:16.366
I don't think this is helping right now.

10:16.367 --> 10:17.600
Is that him?

10:17.601 --> 10:18.967
Let me talk to him.

10:18.968 --> 10:21.300
Here. you know, this is exactly
why we didn't want you

10:21.367 --> 10:22.433
in this interrogation.

10:22.434 --> 10:24.099
Let the grown-ups do their work.

10:24.100 --> 10:25.266
Fine. I'm hanging up now.

10:25.267 --> 10:26.867
Good. I'm glad. I'm gladder.

10:26.868 --> 10:29.367
(phone beeps)

10:29.434 --> 10:31.233
Now, where were we? Why don't you tell us

10:31.234 --> 10:32.666
what it is that you're really after.

10:32.667 --> 10:34.333
Volkoff will know that they are dead,

10:34.334 --> 10:36.567
which means that he will
be coming here for me.

10:36.634 --> 10:39.767
We are not safe here.

10:41.567 --> 10:43.934
Sarah, pick up the phone.

11:01.567 --> 11:03.667
I was able to get what you wanted.

11:03.734 --> 11:05.399
Fantastic.

11:05.400 --> 11:08.734
Now, you said you're willing to do...

11:08.801 --> 11:10.533
<i>anything</i> for it.

11:10.534 --> 11:13.300
First...

11:13.367 --> 11:15.300
I need you to shave my back.

11:15.367 --> 11:17.233
I can't reach the middle.

11:17.234 --> 11:19.501
Thomas Jefferson Barnes!

11:19.567 --> 11:21.501
Um, Jeffrey...

11:21.534 --> 11:23.434
what the hell are you doing?!

11:23.534 --> 11:24.900
Getting what I deserve.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.600
Getting what you...? Really?

11:26.601 --> 11:28.099
Excuse me.

11:28.100 --> 11:30.467
Listen to me. We can't afford to let

11:30.534 --> 11:32.467
strangers shave your back, Jeffrey.

11:32.534 --> 11:35.734
Not now when we're this close
to making our dreams come true.

11:36.834 --> 11:38.734
You're so pretty.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.300
I...

11:45.601 --> 11:47.968
And we're secure.

12:05.234 --> 12:06.800
Good work.

12:06.801 --> 12:08.701
Now let's get what we came for.

12:45.500 --> 12:46.799
Look there's something she's not telling us.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.499
Well, you're not really
doing yourself any favors

12:48.500 --> 12:50.967
by calling in the middle of the
interrogation. I'm sorry.

12:51.034 --> 12:53.434
If you want to go back in there, I promise

12:53.468 --> 12:55.368
I'll stay off the phone.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.166
One second.

13:00.167 --> 13:01.566
I just gotta...

13:01.567 --> 13:03.967
It's... I'm not calling you at least.

13:04.034 --> 13:05.733
Hey, buddy, I can't really talk right now.

13:05.734 --> 13:07.400
We're in the middle of a crisis here.

13:07.401 --> 13:09.200
I don't know what kind of
crisis you're in, Chuck,

13:09.201 --> 13:10.467
but mine's carrying AK-47s

13:10.468 --> 13:13.533
and just took over the store. Hey...

13:15.001 --> 13:16.166
Alexei Volkoff.

13:16.167 --> 13:17.433
Volkoff? Did you just say Volkoff?

13:17.434 --> 13:18.532
Volkoff is here?!

13:18.533 --> 13:20.433
Morgan, Morgan, hey, hey, I need you hide

13:20.434 --> 13:22.700
and do not come out until...

13:22.767 --> 13:25.434
Morgan, I think Volkoff just
cut off our cell phones.

13:25.500 --> 13:28.734
That's always Volkoff's first move-
kill all communications.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.734
Hmm... What-what are we gonna do?!

13:30.800 --> 13:32.532
Morgan is still up there.

13:32.533 --> 13:35.267
Lucky for us, this is a
state-of-the-art CIA facility.

13:35.334 --> 13:37.368
We're fully prepared for an internal attack.

13:41.067 --> 13:44.234
You've less than a minute. Impress me.

13:45.800 --> 13:47.734
Okay, let's do some damage.

13:50.267 --> 13:52.900
Attention members of the CIA.

13:52.967 --> 13:55.468
You've killed three of my men
and captured my best agent.

13:55.533 --> 13:57.600
I'm here to get her back.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.600
Keep talking, commie. It's party time.

14:16.767 --> 14:20.034
CASEY Mr. Volkoff, exit the Buy More now.

14:20.101 --> 14:22.134
K.K., go.

14:28.667 --> 14:31.167
Weapons system online.

14:32.434 --> 14:34.334
Better dead than red.

14:40.468 --> 14:43.001
Weapons disabled.

14:43.067 --> 14:44.932
Casey, what's happening?

14:44.967 --> 14:46.799
Must've hacked into the system.

14:46.800 --> 14:47.966
My guns are do.

14:47.967 --> 14:50.934
Understand... this is not a negotiation.

14:52.900 --> 14:55.667
Give me Frost or I'll kill you all,

14:55.767 --> 14:58.867
starting with the fat man and the Indian.

15:04.700 --> 15:06.600
God!

15:06.633 --> 15:08.166
Progress?

15:08.167 --> 15:09.733
Our scans revealed a hidden elevator shaft

15:09.734 --> 15:11.934
behind the Home Theater Room,
but K.K. can't seem

15:12.001 --> 15:13.166
to override the system,

15:13.167 --> 15:16.368
and it's three feet of carbide steel.

15:16.434 --> 15:18.334
Start cutting.

15:21.001 --> 15:22.899
<i>Okay, good news-bad news:</i>

15:22.900 --> 15:24.367
Jeff and Lester are about to die.

15:24.368 --> 15:25.899
I'd say that's bad news.

15:25.900 --> 15:28.734
Good news: I've manually locked
down all entrances to Castle.

15:28.800 --> 15:30.300
Bad news: we're sitting ducks down here.

15:30.301 --> 15:31.499
They're cutting in through the elevator shaft.

15:31.500 --> 15:32.733
They'll be down here in an hour.

15:32.734 --> 15:34.233
Now we have one option.

15:34.234 --> 15:37.034
The Buy More defenses have a
manual override. They're buried

15:37.101 --> 15:38.566
deep in the access tunnels here.

15:38.567 --> 15:40.834
If we can patch in there,
we can override the lock-down.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.133
Bring our defenses back up.

15:42.134 --> 15:44.101
Right. Now you two stay down here with mama.

15:44.167 --> 15:46.567
When Volkoff calls to negotiate,
buy me some time.

15:46.633 --> 15:48.533
I don't get it. Why would Volkoff pull off

15:48.568 --> 15:50.433
a full-on assault on a CIA facility

15:50.468 --> 15:52.900
for a one agent? He's got to
be after something bigger.

15:52.967 --> 15:54.900
Yeah, well, whatever it is,

15:54.967 --> 15:57.600
there's something my mom's not telling us.

15:57.700 --> 16:00.101
I'm not lying. He wants me.

16:00.167 --> 16:02.234
You're saying he'll take on the entire CIA,

16:02.301 --> 16:03.833
risk his whole organization for one agent?

16:03.834 --> 16:05.734
He...

16:12.368 --> 16:14.734
I need to know that Frost is still alive.

16:14.767 --> 16:16.667
Put her on the phone.

16:17.500 --> 16:18.566
Chuck,

16:18.567 --> 16:21.301
you have to turn me over to him.

16:21.368 --> 16:23.301
Please trust me.

16:26.368 --> 16:28.268
I don't.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.401
Volkoff, this is Charles Carmichael.

16:32.468 --> 16:34.434
I'm the only one you'll be speaking with.

16:34.500 --> 16:37.301
Charles, so good to hear your voice again.

16:37.368 --> 16:40.734
Now, I know how scared you must be,

16:40.800 --> 16:43.434
cut off from help with a
madman closing in on you.

16:43.500 --> 16:46.434
So let me offer you a simple suggestion:

16:46.500 --> 16:50.301
hand Frost the damn phone!

16:53.567 --> 16:55.467
I think he wants to talk to you.

16:56.267 --> 16:58.167
Alexei, I'm here.

17:00.600 --> 17:01.899
Frost...

17:01.900 --> 17:03.800
thank God.

17:03.834 --> 17:05.665
Are they treating you all right?

17:05.666 --> 17:07.000
I'm fine.

17:07.001 --> 17:08.233
Did they feed you?

17:08.233 --> 17:09.400
Yes.

17:09.401 --> 17:11.266
Was it good?

17:11.267 --> 17:14.834
It was delicious.

17:14.900 --> 17:18.267
You tell them they'd better
continue treating you well

17:18.334 --> 17:20.200
or I'll make life

17:20.201 --> 17:22.101
very uncomfortable for them very soon.

17:22.136 --> 17:24.300
Tell them

17:24.367 --> 17:28.567
that I'm not leaving here
without you, my love.

17:28.633 --> 17:32.533
What...?

17:32.600 --> 17:34.900
What...? My love?!

17:35.034 --> 17:36.934
What does that mean?

17:37.734 --> 17:40.834
It means that Alexei Volkoff...

17:40.900 --> 17:42.934
is in love with me.

17:51.801 --> 17:53.366
He's in love with you?!
He called you "My love."

17:53.367 --> 17:55.467
Who exactly is Volkoff to you?!
Is he your boyfriend?

17:55.534 --> 17:57.167
Is he the reason you left Dad?

17:57.168 --> 17:58.633
No.

17:58.634 --> 18:01.134
Alexei and I have never been together.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.499
It's just he...

18:02.500 --> 18:05.467
he's in love with me, that's all.

18:05.534 --> 18:07.332
That's all?! Got it! Got it! Great!

18:07.333 --> 18:08.800
No, you don't get it.

18:08.801 --> 18:11.200
Sarah, explain to him.

18:11.267 --> 18:12.499
If you were working undercover

18:12.500 --> 18:14.365
with the world's biggest psychopath,

18:14.400 --> 18:17.034
d that psychopath falls in love with you...

18:18.634 --> 18:22.233
That would make me a
major intelligence asset.

18:22.300 --> 18:23.866
I see.

18:23.867 --> 18:26.667
So that's why you've been gone
from my life since I was nine?!

18:26.734 --> 18:29.068
Chuck, I'm a spy.

18:29.134 --> 18:30.466
It was my mission.

18:30.467 --> 18:32.067
You've been close to Volkoff for years.

18:32.068 --> 18:33.533
Why didn't you just take him out?

18:33.534 --> 18:36.333
My mission was to take down
the network, not the man.

18:36.400 --> 18:39.134
Which is something I still
might be able to do.

18:39.233 --> 18:41.467
But if you want to save yourself and your

18:41.534 --> 18:43.634
friends, then you need
to turn me over to him.

18:43.734 --> 18:45.634
You have no choice.

18:46.967 --> 18:48.967
Chuck, wait.

18:51.734 --> 18:53.199
Hey, are you okay?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.300
How can I trust anything she says?

18:55.367 --> 18:58.333
Every time that I do, I wind up
getting shot or almost blown up.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.199
I haven't been stabbed yet.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.134
Chuck, going undercover for
so long and staying loyal

19:02.200 --> 19:04.300
is am extremely hard thing to do as a spy.

19:04.367 --> 19:06.967
I mean, I got lucky; I was assigned to you.

19:07.034 --> 19:08.399
Your mom got Volkoff.

19:08.400 --> 19:11.168
Do you think Volkoff
really is in love with her?

19:11.233 --> 19:12.366
If he is,

19:12.367 --> 19:14.133
I bet he would rather negotiate with us

19:14.134 --> 19:15.499
than risk her getting hurt.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.034
Sarah, I might be mad at my mom,
like, really, really mad,

19:18.101 --> 19:19.666
but I'm never going to hurt her.

19:19.667 --> 19:21.567
Yeah, you and I both know that,
but Volkoff doesn't.

19:21.934 --> 19:25.034
It might help us to buy more time for Casey

19:36.867 --> 19:38.067
Casey!

19:38.068 --> 19:40.300
Morgan, what the hell are you doing in here?

19:40.367 --> 19:42.333
Where are your shoes?

19:42.400 --> 19:44.333
It's kind of a funny story, actually.
I was sitting...

19:44.400 --> 19:45.566
Never mind about the shoes.

19:45.567 --> 19:47.067
Now listen, where are Chuck and Sarah?

19:47.068 --> 19:48.833
And what the hell is going on here?

19:48.834 --> 19:50.466
Volkoff's taken control of the Buy More.

19:50.467 --> 19:51.666
He's captured Tweedle-dumb
and Tweedle-dumber.

19:51.667 --> 19:53.567
He's got 'em tied up in the storage area.

19:53.634 --> 19:55.901
He's gonna kill 'em if we
don't give him Chuck's mom.

19:56.001 --> 19:58.101
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
He's got Jeff and Lester? Mm-hmm.

19:58.168 --> 19:59.599
We gotta save 'em! If we don't
get those guns up and working,

19:59.600 --> 20:01.133
we're all gonna be killed.

20:01.134 --> 20:02.499
No, no, no, you're absolutely right.

20:02.500 --> 20:03.866
Okay, I'll go.

20:03.867 --> 20:05.232
Okay, you get the guns up and running,

20:05.233 --> 20:06.900
and I'll save Jeff and Lester.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.068
Morgan, that's a stupid idea.

20:09.134 --> 20:11.500
Maybe, but I'm not gonna
sit here on all fours

20:11.567 --> 20:13.332
and watch those two die, okay?

20:13.333 --> 20:15.467
Now wish me luck.

20:15.534 --> 20:17.434
Wait!

20:20.134 --> 20:22.367
You might need that.

20:24.267 --> 20:25.433
That's good thinking.

20:25.434 --> 20:27.734
The muzzle! Right, I got it. I got it.

20:38.834 --> 20:39.866
Yes, Charles?

20:39.867 --> 20:41.366
You want Frost,

20:41.367 --> 20:43.367
and we have her.

20:43.434 --> 20:45.167
Now, if you do what we ask,

20:45.168 --> 20:46.966
I'll make sure that she doesn't get hurt.

20:46.967 --> 20:48.700
But if you don't do what we ask,

20:48.701 --> 20:51.034
then bad things are going to happen to her.

20:51.068 --> 20:53.500
Very bad things.

20:53.567 --> 20:55.534
Like...

20:55.600 --> 20:57.967
Well, just very bad things.
We'll leave it at that.

20:59.034 --> 21:00.934
Is that a threat?

21:04.300 --> 21:07.001
Let me show you something.

21:12.333 --> 21:15.667
This is a thermite-TH3 incendiary explosive.

21:15.734 --> 21:19.567
When it's detonated,
the temperatures will exceed

21:19.634 --> 21:21.901
4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

21:21.967 --> 21:24.101
Metal will boil.

21:24.168 --> 21:27.034
I'm gonna drop it down the elevator shaft,

21:27.101 --> 21:30.233
and it will incinerate
every single one of you,

21:30.300 --> 21:32.200
including my beloved Frost.

21:34.101 --> 21:37.200
I'd rather she died than
have to live without me.

21:37.267 --> 21:39.534
Give her back to me,

21:39.600 --> 21:42.134
and I'll let you live.

21:42.200 --> 21:46.534
That's how you threaten someone, Charles.

21:48.667 --> 21:51.068
So much for buying Casey more time.

22:22.367 --> 22:23.800
Hey, you came for me.

22:23.801 --> 22:25.701
Mm. Thank you.

22:26.134 --> 22:28.034
No time to talk, Grimes.

22:34.233 --> 22:35.900
We were supposed to sell these.

22:35.901 --> 22:37.801
What is wrong with those guys?

23:20.600 --> 23:22.667
Tell your men to back off.

23:22.734 --> 23:24.366
Don't be afraid.

23:24.367 --> 23:26.267
I told you I'd let you live,

23:26.302 --> 23:27.499
and I meant it.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.400
But you should know...

23:29.467 --> 23:31.367
I have your friend, Casey.

23:38.867 --> 23:40.767
Put down your weapons.

23:54.233 --> 23:55.700
Frost.

23:55.701 --> 23:58.967
Thank you for coming for me.

23:59.001 --> 24:01.168
I had no choice.

24:07.467 --> 24:10.934
Now, there is just one small matter

24:11.001 --> 24:12.901
to deal with.

24:15.600 --> 24:18.233
Chuck.

24:19.567 --> 24:22.068
What happened to letting us go?!

24:22.134 --> 24:23.466
I lied.

24:23.467 --> 24:25.801
But in my defense,
you threatened the woman I love.

24:28.101 --> 24:33.001
Frost, I hope you feel this
is a romantic gesture.

24:33.967 --> 24:35.934
Alexei, you can't!

24:36.001 --> 24:37.901
Why not? You like romance.

24:38.001 --> 24:40.068
Because...

24:41.767 --> 24:44.001
Charles is my son.

24:52.500 --> 24:54.033
Really?

24:54.034 --> 24:56.068
Really.

24:59.967 --> 25:01.299
Really?

25:01.300 --> 25:03.500
Really.

25:07.034 --> 25:08.967
Really?!

25:09.034 --> 25:10.934
Really!

25:22.001 --> 25:24.001
So this is why he isn't dead.

25:24.068 --> 25:26.434
I'm sorry, Alexei.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.701
My one weakness is my love for my son.

25:28.767 --> 25:30.433
And he knows this

25:30.434 --> 25:32.634
and uses it against me.

25:32.701 --> 25:34.033
Don't be hard on yourself.

25:34.034 --> 25:36.767
We always expect the best
from the ones we love,

25:36.834 --> 25:39.034
and rarely get it.

25:39.101 --> 25:41.034
Why didn't you tell me?

25:41.101 --> 25:44.367
Alexei, you run a multinational
criminal organization.

25:44.434 --> 25:46.701
There's no room for family.

25:46.767 --> 25:49.367
Especially family that works for the CIA.

25:49.434 --> 25:51.033
What did you think I was going to do?

25:51.034 --> 25:52.666
Sir, there's an incoming
call on the Buy More lines...

25:52.667 --> 25:54.567
Shut up!

26:01.901 --> 26:03.801
...from an Ellie Bartowski.

26:10.034 --> 26:13.934
Any relation, this Ellie Bartowski,

26:14.001 --> 26:16.467
Mr. Bartowski?

26:23.867 --> 26:26.667
Yeah.

26:26.734 --> 26:28.867
No.

26:28.934 --> 26:31.867
No, ye-yeah... uh, distant, distant relative,

26:31.934 --> 26:35.834
who-who... Sh-She's like,
she lives in Alaska, I think.

26:35.901 --> 26:37.299
Come to think of it, she's in Bangladesh.

26:37.300 --> 26:38.766
You don't want, you don't want to...

26:38.767 --> 26:40.599
Chuck? That's not necessary. Please don't...

26:40.600 --> 26:43.701
Hey, it's me. Are you
coming for dinner tonight?

26:45.634 --> 26:47.266
I'm kind of, uh, I'm kind
of tied up here at work, sis.

26:47.267 --> 26:50.068
No, you have to come;
I have so much food here,

26:50.134 --> 26:51.700
and we didn't get to have

26:51.701 --> 26:53.366
a family Thanksgiving dinner this year.

26:53.367 --> 26:56.333
It'd be fun. Please?

26:58.801 --> 27:01.034
I'll try my best.

27:01.068 --> 27:02.968
Okay, great. I'll see you soon.

27:03.434 --> 27:05.734
VOLKOFF So...

27:05.801 --> 27:08.534
a son <i>and</i> a daughter.

27:10.834 --> 27:12.767
You didn't think I could have a relationship

27:12.834 --> 27:14.834
with your family?

27:14.901 --> 27:17.867
Kids love me.

27:20.734 --> 27:22.634
I'll prove you wrong.

27:23.934 --> 27:25.834
Charles...

27:27.300 --> 27:29.200
Chuck.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.167
(muffled yell)

27:32.168 --> 27:34.400
Call your sister back.

27:34.467 --> 27:36.367
Tell her you're coming to dinner.

27:53.367 --> 27:55.534
I know it's tough; we just have to be calm.

27:55.567 --> 27:57.266
You just brought a psychotic killer

27:57.267 --> 27:59.200
back to your pregnant daughter's house.

27:59.234 --> 28:00.566
Considering the circumstances,

28:00.567 --> 28:01.800
I'd say I'm pretty damn calm right now.

28:01.801 --> 28:02.967
Everything's gonna be fine.

28:02.968 --> 28:04.700
You'll just have to trust me on this.

28:04.701 --> 28:06.834
Yeah, I've heard that before.

28:09.300 --> 28:11.300
Alexei,

28:11.367 --> 28:13.300
you do understand that

28:13.367 --> 28:16.067
my daughter and her husband are civilians?

28:16.133 --> 28:18.033
Of course.

28:18.100 --> 28:20.000
I don't want to frighten your family.

28:20.067 --> 28:22.734
I just want to get to know them.

28:25.601 --> 28:27.501
Hi!

28:29.701 --> 28:31.566
Mom?

28:31.601 --> 28:33.801
Yeah, remember I was telling you

28:33.868 --> 28:36.100
I was going to bring some
surprise guests? So...

28:36.167 --> 28:38.067
surprise!

28:39.300 --> 28:40.600
Hey.

28:40.601 --> 28:43.234
I'm Devon, your... your son-in-law.

28:43.300 --> 28:44.999
Hey...

28:45.000 --> 28:46.867
Come on in. Hello.

28:46.868 --> 28:49.367
Nice to meet you.
Chuck, I want you to have fun tonight.

28:49.434 --> 28:51.099
But if I get the feeling

28:51.100 --> 28:54.300
that you're plotting against me...

28:54.367 --> 28:58.400
I need this dinner to be perfect,
understand?

28:58.467 --> 28:59.800
Yeah, I think we do.

28:59.801 --> 29:01.132
I think you don't.

29:01.133 --> 29:03.300
If it isn't perfect,

29:03.400 --> 29:05.300
I will take it out on the people you love

29:08.133 --> 29:11.801
Well, this has been quite the surprise.

29:11.868 --> 29:13.500
I can't remember the last time

29:13.501 --> 29:15.634
we had you here for Thanksgiving, Mom.

29:16.701 --> 29:19.234
It was 1990.

29:19.300 --> 29:20.533
You were 12.

29:20.534 --> 29:22.366
Chuck was nine.

29:22.367 --> 29:24.334
The turkey was overcooked.

29:24.400 --> 29:25.833
That's right.

29:25.834 --> 29:27.666
That's right. I remember that.

29:27.667 --> 29:29.767
I, however, thought that
the turkey tasted fine.

29:31.701 --> 29:33.433
So, uh, Alexei,

29:33.434 --> 29:35.667
you-you work with my mom. Can I...?

29:35.734 --> 29:38.334
I mean, am I allowed to
ask what happened to her?

29:40.400 --> 29:42.601
Well, it's complicated.

29:42.667 --> 29:44.567
Let me explain.

29:45.200 --> 29:46.600
Well, Ellie,

29:46.601 --> 29:47.867
in our business, sometimes

29:47.868 --> 29:50.501
good people get confused for bad, and...

29:50.567 --> 29:53.634
the bad for good.

29:53.701 --> 29:55.566
But fortunately,

29:55.601 --> 29:57.466
being your mother's handler,

29:57.501 --> 30:00.601
I was able to help convince
the CIA that she is good.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.666
Right, Sarah?

30:03.667 --> 30:05.701
Right. Absolutely.

30:05.767 --> 30:07.968
And that's why your
mother is free to go now.

30:10.367 --> 30:12.132
Well, that's good news, right?

30:12.133 --> 30:14.901
Oh, yeah.

30:14.968 --> 30:17.000
I know how painful it was

30:17.067 --> 30:18.800
for your mother when she had to leave you

30:18.801 --> 30:20.066
all those years ago.

30:20.067 --> 30:22.634
And I know how painful it must have been

30:22.701 --> 30:24.667
for you, too.

30:24.734 --> 30:26.634
And your brother.

30:28.767 --> 30:30.801
Thank you

30:30.868 --> 30:32.566
for helping our mom.

30:32.567 --> 30:35.334
You can't imagine what
you've done for this family.

30:35.400 --> 30:39.434
Families come first.

30:45.400 --> 30:48.300
Come on, think, Morgan, think.

30:48.367 --> 30:51.434
There's no Chuck, no Sarah.

30:51.501 --> 30:53.434
It's up to you to save them.

30:53.501 --> 30:55.501
How? How?

31:02.667 --> 31:05.567
Okay? Yeah.

31:05.634 --> 31:06.933
Okay, a movie. Movie.

31:06.934 --> 31:07.933
Yes!

31:07.934 --> 31:10.067
Gosh. Um...

31:10.133 --> 31:12.734
ELLIE: Three words.

31:40.767 --> 31:43.767
Hey, buddy, you having a good time?

31:43.834 --> 31:45.132
Are you kidding?

31:45.133 --> 31:46.533
This Alexei is totally awesome.

31:46.534 --> 31:47.533
First guy I've met

31:47.534 --> 31:49.266
who's free-climbed K2, no oxygen.

31:49.267 --> 31:50.733
Hard core, bro.

31:50.734 --> 31:52.566
Yeah, yeah, he's something else, isn't he?

31:52.567 --> 31:54.399
You know what else he is?

31:54.400 --> 31:56.132
An international arms dealer

31:56.133 --> 31:58.400
and a very, very bad man.

31:58.467 --> 32:00.333
We're in terrible danger right now.
Don't freak out.

32:00.334 --> 32:01.366
<i>Bourne Identity!</i>

32:01.367 --> 32:02.967
No!

32:02.968 --> 32:03.967
Ah!

32:03.968 --> 32:05.299
So close. Dude...

32:05.300 --> 32:06.566
this is not funny.

32:06.567 --> 32:09.634
Well, it's also not a joke, Devon, okay?

32:09.701 --> 32:10.700
Kangaroo.

32:10.701 --> 32:11.967
Paw. Paw.

32:11.968 --> 32:13.366
I didn't want to have to tell you this,

32:13.367 --> 32:14.366
but I'm spying again,

32:14.367 --> 32:15.999
and I really need your help.

32:16.000 --> 32:17.199
<i>Batman Forever?</i>

32:17.200 --> 32:20.767
Wrong again, Charles.

32:22.133 --> 32:23.600
You really should make some guesses,

32:23.601 --> 32:25.501
otherwise, it looks suspicious.

32:25.536 --> 32:27.436
Uh, <i>Bourne Identity!</i>

32:31.000 --> 32:32.399
I just said that.

32:32.400 --> 32:33.833
Whatever, man. I'm freaking here.

32:33.834 --> 32:35.533
What are you thinking,
bringing this guy home?

32:35.534 --> 32:36.999
Look, I'm sorry, okay? It's not my fault.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.132
It wasn't my decision.

32:38.133 --> 32:39.566
Look, Sarah and I can't make a move

32:39.567 --> 32:40.700
without setting off Alexei's alarm bells,

32:40.701 --> 32:41.999
but you're a civilian, okay?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.100
He won't suspect you of anything.

32:45.534 --> 32:47.467
Devon, I know you're the world's worst liar,

32:47.567 --> 32:49.433
but right now...

32:49.434 --> 32:51.334
I need you to be awesome.

32:53.801 --> 32:56.000
What do you want me to do?

32:57.400 --> 32:59.066
Hey. Looks like we're out of sugar.

32:59.067 --> 33:00.433
Hey, Chuck.

33:00.434 --> 33:02.434
<i>You got any at your place?</i>

33:07.634 --> 33:10.200
Just getting some sugar.

33:26.300 --> 33:28.934
Cold.

33:31.667 --> 33:33.634
CIA emergency alert activated.

33:33.701 --> 33:36.267
Wow. That is surprisingly soothing.

33:39.767 --> 33:41.132
Got the sugar.

33:41.133 --> 33:43.033
Oh, nice.

33:45.667 --> 33:47.567
I'll take that.

33:50.434 --> 33:52.701
Shouldn't your cell phone be ringing?

33:52.767 --> 33:55.000
Huh? Right.

33:56.734 --> 33:58.934
Huh. It's the hospital.

34:00.601 --> 34:02.501
Hello?

34:03.267 --> 34:04.466
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.

34:04.467 --> 34:06.901
Well, if you need us, we'll be right there.

34:06.968 --> 34:08.466
What is it?

34:08.467 --> 34:10.299
There was a bus accident
on the 101- code blue.

34:10.300 --> 34:11.766
They need all the hands they can get.

34:11.766 --> 34:13.667
Oh, God.

34:14.367 --> 34:17.000
I'm so sorry that we have
to take off like this.

34:17.067 --> 34:19.132
It was a wonderful evening.

34:23.132 --> 34:25.567
Go save some lives. Okay.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.333
It was great to see you, Mom.

34:31.534 --> 34:32.800
Talk to you soon.

34:32.801 --> 34:34.701
Okay. Okay.

34:35.467 --> 34:36.699
Bye.

34:36.701 --> 34:39.132
See you soon.

34:41.033 --> 34:44.266
Such a sad end to a wonderful evening.

34:47.400 --> 34:50.132
You had to go and alert the CIA, didn't you?

34:53.234 --> 34:54.867
Don't move.

34:54.868 --> 34:58.200
You do know that the nearest
tactical response team

34:58.267 --> 35:00.267
is over ten minutes away.

35:02.200 --> 35:03.800
Until then,

35:03.801 --> 35:06.334
anything could happen.

35:06.367 --> 35:08.267
Drop it, Sarah.

35:09.334 --> 35:10.700
Mom, seriously?

35:10.701 --> 35:12.601
You're betraying me again?

35:14.834 --> 35:16.500
No! Stop! Alexei,

35:16.501 --> 35:17.867
we've had our dinner.

35:17.868 --> 35:19.433
You've met the family.

35:19.434 --> 35:21.066
We're leaving.

35:21.067 --> 35:23.100
But what kind of potential father-in-law

35:23.167 --> 35:26.100
would I be if I didn't set an example?

35:26.167 --> 35:27.867
Chuck has to learn

35:27.868 --> 35:30.367
you make a threat, you follow through on it.

35:32.667 --> 35:34.801
I don't really have to do that, but...

35:34.868 --> 35:37.968
I just really like the sound.

35:38.067 --> 35:40.400
Alexei, stop.

35:42.534 --> 35:44.434
My love?

35:45.567 --> 35:47.399
What are you doing?

35:47.400 --> 35:51.033
This is exactly why I didn't
tell you about my family.

35:51.100 --> 35:52.700
You don't know how to love someone.

35:52.701 --> 35:54.601
You only know how to control them.

35:55.834 --> 35:57.633
But you should know

35:57.634 --> 35:59.333
that I could never love a man

35:59.334 --> 36:01.901
who would do anything to hurt my son.

36:01.968 --> 36:03.901
So drop it.

36:12.000 --> 36:14.234
Alexei, you know that I am loyal to you,

36:14.300 --> 36:16.400
but I will not return with you

36:16.467 --> 36:18.868
until you promise me that my family

36:18.934 --> 36:22.200
and their friends will remain safe

36:22.267 --> 36:24.501
And if they don't...

36:24.567 --> 36:27.000
I will end you.

36:34.767 --> 36:37.067
You see?

36:37.133 --> 36:40.067
That is a real threat.

36:50.801 --> 36:54.267
Chuck, I'm sorry for everything.

36:55.367 --> 36:57.634
I hope someday you'll trust me.

36:59.834 --> 37:01.734
Mom.

37:05.200 --> 37:07.133
I already do.

37:29.600 --> 37:31.500
Hey, guys.

37:34.001 --> 37:37.267
I surrender.

37:38.434 --> 37:40.334
I surrender.

37:44.001 --> 37:45.901
Yippee ki-yay.

37:49.168 --> 37:51.068
Yippee ki...

37:51.600 --> 37:53.500
Hey.

37:56.634 --> 37:58.232
Yippee ki-yay...

37:58.233 --> 38:00.133
Yip...

38:04.567 --> 38:06.901
Okay.

38:06.967 --> 38:08.867
I surrender.

38:08.901 --> 38:10.934
You're free to go.

38:11.001 --> 38:12.833
What? What?

38:12.834 --> 38:15.300
Volkoff's orders. We're out.

38:28.367 --> 38:30.267
What should we do with these two?

38:37.934 --> 38:39.566
What's going on?

38:39.567 --> 38:42.667
You two have some sort of
orgy in here last night?

38:42.734 --> 38:44.634
I don't think... Yes.

38:47.534 --> 38:50.333
Tell me you weren't planning on
selling these phones on eBay.

38:51.600 --> 38:53.033
Depend..

38:53.034 --> 38:54.866
on what you mean

38:54.867 --> 38:56.767
by eBay.

38:57.567 --> 38:58.766
Then, you wouldn't have any problem

38:58.767 --> 39:00.834
getting that back out on the sales floor.

39:00.901 --> 39:02.266
Let's say ten minutes?

39:02.267 --> 39:05.233
And get them band stickers off them boxes.

39:11.934 --> 39:13.799
I wish I would have trusted my mom

39:13.834 --> 39:16.734
instead of being so angry
with her the whole time.

39:16.801 --> 39:19.333
And now... she's gone.

39:19.400 --> 39:21.967
And she can't come back-
not until Volkoff is destroyed.

39:22.034 --> 39:23.633
He knows too much.

39:23.634 --> 39:25.767
She's the only thing
keeping us safe right now.

39:28.400 --> 39:30.667
Hey, bro. Can I talk to you for a minute?

39:30.734 --> 39:32.634
Sure.

39:34.667 --> 39:36.499
Uh... hey. What's up?

39:36.500 --> 39:37.733
What the hell were you thinking?

39:37.734 --> 39:39.100
Not only are you spying again,

39:39.101 --> 39:41.534
but you bring it back to our apartment?

39:41.600 --> 39:43.967
I had to lie to Ellie out the hospital,
and I hate lying.

39:44.034 --> 39:46.233
I'm sorry, okay? I- I-I really am.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.634
I was trying to protect my mom,
and things went sideways.

39:48.701 --> 39:50.033
Stop. Okay? Just stop.

39:50.034 --> 39:51.566
I don't want to know.

39:51.567 --> 39:54.034
I don't want this spy stuff
near Ellie ever again.

39:54.101 --> 39:55.966
Never. Never, ever again.

39:55.967 --> 39:58.467
And she doesn't want it near you,
either. Understand?

39:58.534 --> 40:01.901
So this conversation never took place.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.966
Devon, this is one of my father's laptops.

40:08.967 --> 40:10.666
How did you...? He left it for Ellie.

40:10.667 --> 40:12.834
It was broken, and we fixed it.

40:12.901 --> 40:15.834
There's something on it- brain scans.

40:15.901 --> 40:17.934
Some memory problem that Ellie figured out.

40:19.434 --> 40:21.767
What do... what does it mean?

40:21.834 --> 40:25.267
I don't want to know,
and neither does Ellie,

40:25.333 --> 40:29.101
but if you're spying again,
maybe it can help you.

40:35.367 --> 40:37.133
Are you sure you want to do this?

40:37.134 --> 40:39.034
Look, I'm not even sure
what's on this thing,

40:39.069 --> 40:43.634
but if I'm right... then yes.

40:45.333 --> 40:47.233
Let's get this over with.

40:56.467 --> 40:58.367
"One or 11?"

40:59.233 --> 41:01.133
What does that mean?

41:02.467 --> 41:06.134
Well, it's the value of an
ace in blackjack, but...

41:07.701 --> 41:10.500
There was something my
dad used to say to me.

41:56.001 --> 41:58.001
Chuck?

41:58.068 --> 42:00.034
I'm okay.

42:15.834 --> 42:18.367
Guys, I know kung fu... again.
