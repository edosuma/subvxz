19:11.040 --> 19:12.600
‐ Yeah, no news there then.

19:12.600 --> 19:15.040
‐ Basically, I brought a man
to the hospital

19:15.040 --> 19:18.480
assuming that he'd been involved in a
racist attack against Bulgarian people.

19:18.480 --> 19:20.800
‐ That's xenophobic, Aine.
It's not racist.

19:20.800 --> 19:22.960
‐ Oh, fantastic, even my terminology
is wrong.

19:22.960 --> 19:24.080
God, I'm such an idiot.

19:24.080 --> 19:26.200
‐ What's the problem?
Sounds like a nice thing to do.

19:26.200 --> 19:28.600
‐ I never properly asked him what had
gone wrong‐‐I just assumed.

19:28.600 --> 19:31.160
‐ Well, that's idiotic.
‐ Eat my ass, Shona.

19:31.160 --> 19:33.240
‐ Eat my ass!
Eat my‐‐

19:33.240 --> 19:34.840
‐ I've had no food today
and just coffee.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.600
<i>Who are you laughing with?</i>

19:36.600 --> 19:38.360
‐ Um, I'm ju‐‐I'm with Charlotte.

19:38.360 --> 19:40.000
<i>I'm being rude, anyway.</i>
‐ Oh, sorry, sir.

19:40.000 --> 19:41.320
Could you just pull in over here?

19:41.320 --> 19:43.320
Just on the corner, yeah.
Thank you for the charger.

19:43.320 --> 19:45.320
Thank you.
No, keep the change.

19:45.320 --> 19:46.920
Thank you.
Anyway, he was basically

19:46.920 --> 19:50.960
on a building site, and, oh,
I would laugh, only like

19:50.960 --> 19:52.680
James might fire me, Shona.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.760
Anyways, I thought he said
a prick hit him.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.200
<i>But it was actually a brick.</i>
‐ I'm really sorry.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.720
‐ No need to apologize.
Shona, I actually feel

19:59.720 --> 20:01.440
like physically embarrassed for myself.

20:01.440 --> 20:03.880
I'm actually cringing
in my soul at the moment.

20:03.880 --> 20:05.760
Oh, I hate being a guilty Catholic
white woman.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.800
I wish I was one of those
white women who voted for Trump.

20:07.800 --> 20:10.040
‐ Aine, will you just calm down?
Just calm down.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.000
‐ I 'm going, Shona, now,
'cause I have to go into this job,

20:12.000 --> 20:13.440
and the dad's gonna hate me,

20:13.440 --> 20:15.080
but my battery went dead
before I could text him.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.240
I made a promise to the French boy.

20:16.240 --> 20:17.520
‐ Are you on drugs?

20:17.520 --> 20:18.800
‐ Shut up, Shona.
You're on drugs.

20:18.800 --> 20:20.200
Fuck off.
<i>‐ Yeah, okay,</i>

20:20.200 --> 20:22.160
bye.

20:22.160 --> 20:23.520
‐ You all right?

20:23.520 --> 20:25.400
‐ [laughs]

20:25.400 --> 20:28.080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's great.

20:28.080 --> 20:30.160
She's great.
She just gets a bit...

20:30.160 --> 20:32.840
She gets a bit overwhelmed,
you know, so, uh...

20:32.840 --> 20:33.960
Sorry.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.920
‐ Maybe rule number one
of our new club

20:35.920 --> 20:38.960
is that we have to take a shot
every time we say sorry.

20:38.960 --> 20:40.400
‐ Okay.
‐ Sorry. Could we get

20:40.400 --> 20:41.680
two sambucas, please?

20:41.680 --> 20:43.160
‐ Hang on, are you‐‐you're in?

20:43.160 --> 20:44.680
‐ Yeah, fuck it.

20:44.680 --> 20:47.680
Let's change the world, baby.
‐ Okay, let's change the world.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.320
Can I not have a sambuca, though?
Sorry, it makes me barf.

20:50.320 --> 20:52.560
Just a Keeler.
Sorry.

20:55.040 --> 20:56.440
‐ Just so you know, I did turn up.

20:56.440 --> 20:58.040
‐ Right, well, he's asleep now.

20:58.040 --> 20:59.680
‐ Yeah, I‐I am so, so sorry.

20:59.680 --> 21:02.800
Like, I genuinely am.
I know it's so unprofessional.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.240
It's just like‐‐but I had to take
someone to the hospital.

21:05.240 --> 21:07.600
My phone died.
I mean...

21:07.600 --> 21:09.520
But I will just say
I'm so good at my job.

21:09.520 --> 21:14.280
And in terms of him English learning
and all of that,

21:14.280 --> 21:16.480
for him,
I was the only good example.

21:16.480 --> 21:18.280
‐ He needs people he can rely on.

21:18.280 --> 21:21.280
‐ Absolutely, and I am‐‐
‐ Aine!

21:21.280 --> 21:23.520
Hi, Etienne.
‐ [speaking French]

21:23.520 --> 21:26.280
‐ Ah, Etienne, it's not polite
to call someone a retard.

21:26.280 --> 21:28.280
‐ No, that's French for late.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.760
‐ Yeah.
‐ Right. Of course. Jokes.

21:30.760 --> 21:32.960
‐ I‐I mean, I'm just jokes, Richard.

21:32.960 --> 21:34.680
‐ Well, your time keeping is a joke.

21:34.680 --> 21:37.640
‐ The joker has become the jokee.

21:37.640 --> 21:39.360
I'm‐‐[speaking French] Etienne.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.920
‐ I forgive you.
‐ Ah!

21:40.920 --> 21:43.280
‐ For the 5 pound.
‐ I see.

21:43.280 --> 21:45.400
More in this than he lets on.
‐ Yes.

21:45.400 --> 21:47.680
But in fairness‐‐clever move.

21:47.680 --> 21:50.600
Here you go.
RICHARD: What?

21:50.600 --> 21:54.000
‐ But I did also get you something
in case you felt left out.

21:57.040 --> 21:58.880
It's the new John Grisham.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.680
‐ Please.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.240
‐ Can you do tomorrow at 5:00 p. m.?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.840
‐ I can!
I can.

22:09.840 --> 22:12.120
‐ Are you sure there won't be any

22:12.120 --> 22:14.880
dragons you have to slay en route,
or...

22:14.880 --> 22:16.040
‐ I mean, there's no guarantees
of that, Richard.

22:16.040 --> 22:17.800
No, there is!
‐ There is a guarantee.

22:17.800 --> 22:19.160
‐ There is a guarantee for me now.
‐ 5:00 p. m.

22:19.160 --> 22:20.600
‐ 5:00 p. m.
‐ Okay.

22:20.600 --> 22:21.880
‐ Absolutely.
Ha ha!

22:21.880 --> 22:23.280
Okay.
‐ Good night.

22:23.280 --> 22:24.520
