WEBVTT

00:04.254 --> 00:07.464
Hey, how much you give me to eat
this whole jar of olives?

00:07.632 --> 00:10.968
I won't give you anything,
but you'll owe me 2.95.

00:11.803 --> 00:13.178
Done.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.807
Hi. I need an atlas. I need an atlas.

00:16.975 --> 00:19.101
Why? Do you have a report due?

00:20.520 --> 00:22.229
I have a date with this diplomat I met...

00:22.397 --> 00:25.274
...while I was giving free massages
outside the U.N.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.694
And I don't know where his country is.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.988
Okay, let's start with the free massages
at the U.N.

00:31.156 --> 00:34.992
Oh, it's my new thing.
I figure, bodies at peace make peace.

00:36.411 --> 00:39.955
Wow. You might just get
the first Nobel Prize in rubbing.

00:40.623 --> 00:42.666
- So, what country is this guy from?
- Um...

00:47.172 --> 00:49.006
There's a G in there.

00:49.632 --> 00:52.301
- Where's that?
- In your atlas.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.470
- I don't have an atlas.
- Oh.

00:54.637 --> 00:57.347
- Oh, but wait, I do have a globe. Hold on.
- Oh.

00:57.515 --> 00:59.933
- So, Pheebs, what's this guy like?
- Um...

01:00.101 --> 01:01.977
Well, he's very...

01:02.145 --> 01:03.645
...dashing, you know?

01:03.813 --> 01:06.815
And, um, very, very sophisticated.
And he doesn't speak English...

01:06.983 --> 01:09.860
...but according to his translator,
he totally gets me.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.696
Okay, here you go.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.656
What is this?

01:16.326 --> 01:17.868
It's a globe.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.412
And a pencil sharpener.

01:22.499 --> 01:25.375
Hey, anybody need anything copied?
I'm going to the Xerox place.

01:25.543 --> 01:26.668
Uh, no, thanks.

01:26.836 --> 01:29.755
Okay, listen, just give me anything
I can make two of.

01:30.548 --> 01:32.966
If you don't have anything to copy,
why are you going there?

01:33.134 --> 01:35.594
Yeah, are you just going down there
to gawk at that hot girl...

01:35.762 --> 01:37.513
...with the bellybutton ring again?

01:37.680 --> 01:38.972
Yeah. You wanna come?

01:40.642 --> 01:41.892
Yeah.

02:33.236 --> 02:36.446
Come on, Chloe.
Finish up with your customer first.

02:36.614 --> 02:39.491
Come on, Chloe. Come on, Chloe.

02:39.826 --> 02:40.868
Can I help you?

02:41.244 --> 02:43.162
Uh-oh.

02:43.329 --> 02:44.454
Uh, you know what?

02:44.622 --> 02:47.499
We're having second thoughts
about our, uh, copying needs.

02:47.667 --> 02:50.419
And, uh, we'll need a little more time
to think about it.

02:51.337 --> 02:54.756
Chloe, switch with me. There are
some guys here who got a crush on you.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.427
Okay, that hurt us.

02:59.053 --> 03:02.139
Hi, guys. I haven't seen you
since this morning.

03:02.849 --> 03:04.433
Well, uh...

03:06.519 --> 03:07.936
You know.

03:09.272 --> 03:11.481
Hey, what are you guys doing
tomorrow night?

03:11.983 --> 03:13.358
Both of us?

03:13.735 --> 03:16.028
Maybe. Does that scare you?

03:20.909 --> 03:23.869
Relax. It's just Isaac's deejaying
at The Philly.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.996
- You should come.
- Oh. We'll be there.

03:26.164 --> 03:28.457
Great. I'll, uh, see you then.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.334
All right. Rock on.

03:43.306 --> 03:48.143
He says that walking with you makes
this strange city feel like home.

03:48.311 --> 03:51.897
Aw. Me too. Although this city is my home.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.317
So that's dumb, what I said.
Don't tell him I said that.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.903
Um, just... You make something up.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.321
Ahem. Uh...

04:08.081 --> 04:10.040
Nice. Thank you.

04:10.833 --> 04:12.334
This is me. Here.

04:22.512 --> 04:25.138
Your eyes are very pretty.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.350
Thank you very much.

04:28.518 --> 04:29.559
Oh, thank you.

04:39.195 --> 04:40.862
He would like to kiss you.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.702
Okay. You know what?
You don't have to do that now.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.454
No, no, not him. No, you don't.

04:53.668 --> 04:56.378
Okay. Well, the moment's over.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.430
Oh.

05:06.597 --> 05:08.098
Oy.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.228
See, there it is right there.

05:13.396 --> 05:15.230
Wow, it's small.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.734
Yeah, but Sergei said
it took the Germans six weeks...

05:18.901 --> 05:20.819
...to get all the way across it.

05:21.738 --> 05:22.821
So you had fun, huh?

05:22.989 --> 05:26.283
Yeah. Except for, you know,
when you're on a date...

05:26.451 --> 05:28.410
...and you're getting along really great...

05:28.578 --> 05:31.288
...but the guy's translator
keeps getting in the way?

05:31.456 --> 05:33.040
No.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.959
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:36.127 --> 05:37.627
What, is, uh, Rach in her room?

05:37.795 --> 05:40.505
Oh. No, she's still at work,
but she told me to tell you to call her.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.967
Oh, what? Is she gonna cancel
on me again? How could she do this?

05:44.135 --> 05:45.677
Doesn't she know it's our anniversary?

05:45.845 --> 05:49.639
All right, uh, Ross, this is the extent
of my knowledge on the subject.

05:49.807 --> 05:50.932
"Call Rachel."

05:52.143 --> 05:53.435
What's that on the bottom?

05:53.603 --> 05:57.481
Oh. That's my doodle
of a ladybug with a top hat. Ha, ha.

05:57.732 --> 05:58.774
She's fancy.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.654
- Hello?
- Hey, honey.

06:04.822 --> 06:06.782
- Oh, hi.
- Hey. What's going on?

06:06.949 --> 06:10.202
Well, there was a disaster in shipping
and I've gotta get this order in.

06:10.370 --> 06:13.789
Honey, I'm so sorry,
but it looks like I'm gonna be here all night.

06:14.290 --> 06:16.750
What?
Well, um, how about I come up there?

06:16.918 --> 06:20.796
No, no, no, honey, please.
I just have too much to deal with.

06:20.963 --> 06:24.341
Anyway, I'm going out
with Sergei again tonight, and, um...

06:24.509 --> 06:26.510
Could you come
and be the translator's date?

06:26.677 --> 06:30.806
So that when we... You know, it's time
for our alone time, you two can split off?

06:32.183 --> 06:33.850
You know, he's kind of cute.

06:34.018 --> 06:36.019
"Kind of cute" like, "really kind of cute"?

06:36.187 --> 06:39.272
Or "kind of cute" like your friend
Spackle-Back Larry?

06:39.440 --> 06:41.274
Hey, don't call him that.

06:41.442 --> 06:43.777
His name is Spackle-Back Harry.

06:47.907 --> 06:49.741
Hey, you know what?
Maybe we should get going.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.660
I mean, what time did Chloe say
to get there?

06:51.828 --> 06:53.995
- Uh, 10:30.
- What time is it now?

06:54.622 --> 06:55.997
Four-thirty.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.042
- Yeah, all right. So we'll hang out.
- Yeah.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.842
Hey, remember when she brought up
that thing about the three of us?

07:07.009 --> 07:09.428
Yes, vividly.

07:09.762 --> 07:13.640
- She was kidding about that, right?
- Yeah, I think so.

07:18.271 --> 07:19.938
Yeah, I think so.

07:20.773 --> 07:24.234
God, it'd be weird if that situation
presented itself tonight, huh?

07:24.402 --> 07:28.071
Yeah. Yeah, I mean, uh...

07:28.489 --> 07:30.740
...what would we do?

07:32.368 --> 07:35.370
Ha, ha. Dude, I don't know. Ha-ha-ha.

07:36.247 --> 07:37.456
- She was kidding.
- Yeah.

07:37.623 --> 07:39.040
She was...

07:39.542 --> 07:42.252
Just in case, we should come up
with a set of ground rules.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.837
Yeah. For sure.

07:44.005 --> 07:46.465
Okay. You probably
want the first one to be:

07:46.632 --> 07:48.425
"Never open your eyes."

07:49.260 --> 07:53.221
You know? Because you don't
want to be doing something...

07:53.389 --> 07:56.349
...and then look up, right?

07:56.517 --> 07:59.895
And see something that
you don't want to be seeing.

08:00.062 --> 08:01.688
Yeah. Good call. Nice.

08:01.856 --> 08:04.107
Hold it. Hold it.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.570
What if my eyes are closed, and...

08:09.155 --> 08:11.072
And my hand is out there...

08:12.033 --> 08:14.326
Aah! Okay, eyes open at all times.

08:17.788 --> 08:19.206
Oh, hey.

08:19.373 --> 08:23.168
How do we decide where we, ahem...

08:23.336 --> 08:25.795
...you know, each would, ahem,
you know...

08:27.256 --> 08:28.715
...be?
- Right. Right.

08:28.883 --> 08:31.259
Well, you know, we could flip for it.

08:31.469 --> 08:34.471
I guess. But, like, what's heads
and what's tails?

08:36.933 --> 08:40.352
Well, if you don't know that,
then I don't want to do this with you.

08:43.606 --> 08:46.942
No, no, no. I am looking
at a purchase order right here...

08:47.109 --> 08:49.819
...and it clearly states
that we ordered the Riviera bikini...

08:49.987 --> 08:53.698
...in a variety of sizes and colors and...

08:54.450 --> 08:56.910
What does it matter what I'm wearing?

08:57.453 --> 09:00.789
Could I please speak to your supervisor?
Thank you. We're holding.

09:00.957 --> 09:02.290
- Hi.
- Oh!

09:02.458 --> 09:03.917
My God. What are you doing here?

09:04.085 --> 09:06.920
Well, you said
you couldn't go out, so...

09:07.088 --> 09:10.298
You brought a picnic.
Ugh. What a boyfriend.

09:10.466 --> 09:13.677
That's it. On Monday,
I start wearing makeup.

09:14.053 --> 09:17.556
Ross, honey, this is very nice,
but I've got a crisis.

09:17.723 --> 09:19.224
Yeah, but I've got couscous.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.478
Honey. Honey, I'm sorry.
I know it's our anniversary...

09:23.646 --> 09:26.898
...but I told you on the phone
I don't have time to stop.

09:27.066 --> 09:30.652
Okay, you don't have to stop.
I'm invisible. I'm not here.

09:30.820 --> 09:32.445
Yeah, but I don't...

09:32.613 --> 09:35.073
Who approved that order?

09:35.241 --> 09:38.410
Well, there is no Mark Robinson
in this office.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.913
- Get me Mark on the phone.
- Ugh. I love Mark. Do you know Mark?

09:42.623 --> 09:46.001
- Yeah.
- Let me check that with what I've got here.

09:46.168 --> 09:49.671
All right, see, 038 is not the number
for this store. Zero-three-eight is Atlanta.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.011
Heh. Pepper?

09:58.139 --> 10:01.141
- None for me.
- Okay, sorry. Whoo.

10:02.018 --> 10:05.520
I'm sorry. As I was saying,
the store number is wrong.

10:05.688 --> 10:07.981
And I'm sorry, but... Oh, my God!

10:11.027 --> 10:13.695
Okay. It's fine.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.405
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

10:15.573 --> 10:17.866
Excuse me, I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to call you back.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.200
I've got Shemp in my office.

10:22.455 --> 10:24.539
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.958
But, um, hey, oh,
somebody's off the phone.

10:27.126 --> 10:31.296
How about a glass of wine by the fire?
I can get it going again...

10:31.464 --> 10:35.050
Ross, you're not listening.
I don't have time to stop.

10:35.217 --> 10:38.136
- Come on, you don't have 10 minutes?
- I don't have 10 minutes.

10:38.304 --> 10:42.015
- Sophie, does she have 10 minutes?
- Hey, Ross. I told you, I don't.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.644
Don't yell at me, okay?
This is the most I've seen you all week.

10:45.811 --> 10:50.106
Look, I cannot do this right now, okay?
I've got a deadline.

10:50.274 --> 10:52.233
Would you just go home?
I'll talk to you later.

10:52.401 --> 10:54.402
- Yeah, but wait...
- Goodbye.

11:01.577 --> 11:04.245
Uh, actually, that's our three-hole punch.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.629
- Hey.
- Hi.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.839
Look, um, about what happened earlier...

11:15.007 --> 11:18.927
Whoa. I completely understand.
You were stressed.

11:22.431 --> 11:25.433
I was gonna give you a chance
to apologize to me.

11:26.018 --> 11:28.645
For what? For letting you
throw me out of your office?

11:28.938 --> 11:31.981
You had no right
coming down to my office, Ross.

11:32.149 --> 11:35.944
You do not bring a picnic basket
to somebody's work...

11:36.112 --> 11:38.029
...unless maybe they were a park ranger.

11:40.616 --> 11:44.160
Yeah, well, excuse me for wanting
to be with my girlfriend on our anniversary.

11:44.328 --> 11:45.745
Boy, what an ass am I.

11:47.206 --> 11:49.958
But I told you I didn't have the time.

11:50.126 --> 11:51.793
Yeah, well, you never have the time.

11:51.961 --> 11:54.587
I mean, I don't feel like
I have a girlfriend anymore.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.423
Ross, what do you want from me?

11:56.590 --> 11:59.467
You want me to quit my job so
you can feel like you have a girlfriend?

11:59.635 --> 12:03.221
No. But it would nice if you'd realize
that it's just a job.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.516
Just a job?

12:06.684 --> 12:07.726
Yes.

12:08.060 --> 12:12.147
Ross, do you realize this is the first time
in my life I'm doing something I care about?

12:12.314 --> 12:15.442
This is the first time in my life
I'm doing something I'm actually good at?

12:15.609 --> 12:16.943
I mean, if you don't get that...

12:17.111 --> 12:19.654
No, hey, I get that. Okay?
I get that and I'm happy for you.

12:19.822 --> 12:22.323
I'm tired of having a relationship
with your answering machine.

12:22.491 --> 12:25.744
- I don't know what to do anymore.
- Well, neither do I.

12:27.788 --> 12:28.955
Is this about Mark?

12:31.000 --> 12:32.709
- Oh, my God.
- Okay, it's not.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.335
Oh, my God.

12:34.503 --> 12:37.839
I cannot keep having this same fight
over and over again, Ross.

12:38.007 --> 12:40.633
No, you're making this too hard.

12:40.801 --> 12:42.969
I'm making this too hard?
What do you want me to do?

12:43.137 --> 12:44.596
I don't know. I don't know.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.140
Look, ugh, maybe we should
just take a break.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.100
Okay, okay. Fine. You're right.

12:49.268 --> 12:51.811
Let's, uh... Let's take a break.
Let's cool off, okay?

12:51.979 --> 12:54.981
Let's get some frozen yogurt
or something.

12:56.692 --> 12:58.026
No.

13:00.905 --> 13:02.697
A break from us.

13:16.212 --> 13:18.755
- And the advances in collating
in the past five years.

13:18.923 --> 13:21.633
I mean, we just got in an X-5000,
you know?

13:21.801 --> 13:24.552
The X-5000 makes an X-50
look like a T-71.

13:28.474 --> 13:30.016
Hey, it's the dinosaur guy.

13:31.477 --> 13:33.311
- Hi, Ross.
- Oh, hi, Chloe.

13:33.479 --> 13:36.022
I want you to meet some friends of mine.

13:38.108 --> 13:40.151
This guy's my hero.
He comes in with some stuff...

13:40.319 --> 13:41.945
...he wants it blown up 400 percent.

13:42.112 --> 13:44.239
We say we don't do that.
He says, "You gotta."

13:44.406 --> 13:46.449
And you know what? We did it.

13:46.617 --> 13:50.370
And now any time anybody wants 400,
we just say, "Let's Ross it."

13:50.663 --> 13:53.373
And that's the only color that comes in.

13:54.583 --> 13:58.044
Yo, Chloe. Do you have a quarter
for the condom machine?

14:01.757 --> 14:02.966
So, what are you doing here?

14:03.133 --> 14:05.176
I thought tonight was
your big anniversary dinner.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.761
Yeah, a little change of plans.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.597
Uh, we're gonna break up instead.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.519
Oh, and I can also speak a little French.

14:19.316 --> 14:21.192
Why? What did I say?

14:21.360 --> 14:24.779
Well, you just asked if I wanted
to go to bed with you tonight.

14:26.907 --> 14:28.366
- Oh, my God.
- Heh.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.035
No wonder I get such great service
at Café Maurice.

14:32.454 --> 14:33.872
Knock, knock, knock.

14:34.123 --> 14:39.085
Hi. Um, could you please tell Sergei
that, um, I was fascinated...

14:39.253 --> 14:42.088
...by what Boutros Boutros-Ghali
said in the New York Times?

14:45.676 --> 14:48.511
You didn't say,
"Boutros Boutros-Ghali."

14:48.679 --> 14:50.722
Boutros Boutros-Ghali.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.225
He says he was too.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.311
Interesting.

14:57.521 --> 14:59.772
Uh, so I was wondering...

14:59.940 --> 15:01.816
Before you get all talky again...

15:01.984 --> 15:05.486
...um, could you also please
tell Sergei...

15:05.654 --> 15:09.282
...that I really like his suit.

15:22.838 --> 15:25.757
Uh, he said, "Thank you very much.
You look very pretty tonight.

15:25.925 --> 15:28.343
Your hair, golden like the sun."
So you're a chef?

15:29.845 --> 15:32.221
I'm also thinking of opening up
my own restaurant.

15:32.389 --> 15:33.890
- Oh, really?
- Monica...

15:34.058 --> 15:36.017
...could I talk to you behind my menu,
please?

15:39.271 --> 15:42.398
- What are you doing?
- Well, I was having a conversation.

15:42.566 --> 15:44.275
Yeah, but Mischa's
so interested in you...

15:44.443 --> 15:47.236
...that Sergei and I haven't been able
to say two words to each other.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.990
What do you want me to do? Sit here
while the three of you have a conversation?

15:51.158 --> 15:52.867
That would be great. Thank you.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.336
- Hello?
- Oh, hi. It's Mark.

16:03.504 --> 16:06.756
- Oh.
- What? Is it my breath?

16:06.924 --> 16:10.677
No. Sorry. I just thought
you were somebody else. Hi.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.680
Hi, well, look, I was just gonna
leave a message.

16:13.847 --> 16:15.515
Isn't tonight your anniversary dinner?

16:15.683 --> 16:18.559
Well, um...

16:18.727 --> 16:20.436
Rach? Are you okay?

16:20.604 --> 16:22.772
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.358
You wanna talk? I mean, I can come over.

16:25.526 --> 16:28.236
No, really, no. Please. That's okay.

16:28.404 --> 16:30.655
All right. I'm coming over
and I'm bringing Chinese food.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.282
- Oh, yeah, I'm not hungry.
- It's for me.

16:33.450 --> 16:34.617
Oh.

16:35.369 --> 16:37.412
Okay. Bye.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.834
- So, what'll you do?
- What can I do?

16:43.085 --> 16:45.336
One person wants to break up,
you break up.

16:45.504 --> 16:49.257
Hey, no way. Come on, this is you guys.
Call her and work it out.

16:49.425 --> 16:52.635
Come on. We just had this huge fight.
Don't I have to wait a while?

16:52.886 --> 16:57.223
Hey, this isn't like swimming after you eat.
Pick up your phone.

17:01.770 --> 17:03.980
You know that whole swimming thing
is a myth.

17:04.147 --> 17:06.691
Yeah, tell that to my Uncle Lenny.

17:06.858 --> 17:08.984
Why? What happened to him?

17:09.153 --> 17:12.280
Nothing. He just really believes in that.

17:13.699 --> 17:17.117
Ugh. And then we got into this
big, stupid fight... It was awful.

17:17.327 --> 17:21.914
I told him he treats me like
a park ranger, something, ugh...

17:22.958 --> 17:24.416
And then...

17:25.335 --> 17:27.837
...I told him I wanted to take a break.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.214
I don't want to take a break.

17:30.382 --> 17:32.425
Well, I'm sorry.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.512
- Egg roll?
- No.

17:37.431 --> 17:40.433
And then I called him,
and he wasn't there.

17:40.601 --> 17:42.268
He's probably just out.

17:42.436 --> 17:45.480
Oh, thank you. That's very helpful.
I'm glad you came over.

17:50.527 --> 17:52.612
- Hello?
- Hi, it's me.

17:53.155 --> 17:56.491
- Hi. Oh, I'm so glad you called.
- Really?

17:56.658 --> 17:59.994
I've been thinking this is crazy.
Don't you think we can work on this?

18:00.996 --> 18:02.705
Hey, what do you want to drink?

18:02.998 --> 18:04.040
Who's that?

18:05.667 --> 18:07.126
Nobody?

18:07.795 --> 18:10.338
Is it okay if I finish the apple juice?

18:11.006 --> 18:12.090
Is that Mark?

18:13.300 --> 18:17.053
- Ooh, honey, look, he just came over...
- Yeah, got it.

18:22.059 --> 18:25.103
Hey, Dinosaur Guy. Look at you, so sad.

18:25.270 --> 18:28.022
- Come dance.
- Uh, that's okay. Thanks.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.565
Hey.

18:29.733 --> 18:32.527
You don't have to smile.
You just have to dance.

18:32.694 --> 18:35.780
Look, I don't feel like dancing.
I feel like having a drink, okay?

18:35.948 --> 18:38.533
Oh, okay. Hey, two beers.

18:40.285 --> 18:42.703
And the vet said it was time.

18:42.871 --> 18:44.705
And so from half-a-world away...

18:44.873 --> 18:47.917
...while my mother
held the phone to his ear...

18:48.085 --> 18:51.129
...I said goodbye to my dog...

18:51.296 --> 18:53.339
...in seven languages.

18:55.342 --> 18:57.593
- Could I have a tissue?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.805
I just hope you don't accidentally
suck it up through your nose...

19:00.973 --> 19:02.640
...and choke on it.

19:07.729 --> 19:12.358
Ugh. Sergei would like to apologize
for my behavior tonight.

19:13.694 --> 19:16.112
Well, tell him, "Apology accepted."

19:19.074 --> 19:23.411
He's unbelievable. For the first time in
three years, someone wants to talk to me.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.998
But do you think he would let me
enjoy that? No.

19:27.749 --> 19:31.210
You silly diplomat.
Why don't you learn some English, Sergei?

19:33.380 --> 19:36.883
Excuse me, but, um, ahem,
isn't he paying for your dinner?

19:37.050 --> 19:39.051
Hey, the man's dog just died.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.447
I have just resigned my post.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.866
Would you care to accompany me
to the Rainbow Room?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.784
I have diplomatic coupons.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.539
It would be my pleasure.

20:09.249 --> 20:11.417
My guy has coupons.

20:13.086 --> 20:16.047
Your guy can't even say "coupons."

20:20.886 --> 20:22.178
Uh...

20:22.346 --> 20:24.096
Uh, plate.

20:24.473 --> 20:26.766
- Plate. Yes. Plate. Plate.
- Plate. Plate.

20:27.476 --> 20:28.643
Plate.

20:30.312 --> 20:32.104
See, we don't need them.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.192
Plate?

20:36.360 --> 20:37.902
Yeah.

20:41.281 --> 20:43.491
Sleight of hand
And twist of fate

20:43.659 --> 20:47.119
On a bed of nails
She makes me wait

20:47.287 --> 20:49.038
I like this song.

20:49.706 --> 20:52.166
Well, you're practically dancing already.

20:53.460 --> 20:56.337
- Why don't you just do it over here?
- Oh, no.

20:56.505 --> 20:58.714
- What are you, married?
- Ha, ha.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.841
Because that's okay.

21:15.774 --> 21:18.609
Oh, be home, be home, be home...

21:20.445 --> 21:22.321
Be home, be home, be home.

21:25.075 --> 21:26.534
You're not home.

21:32.958 --> 21:36.752
With or without you

21:37.671 --> 21:38.838
Still no smile?

21:46.430 --> 21:54.687
And you give yourself away

21:54.855 --> 21:59.150
And you give

21:59.318 --> 22:02.778
And you give yourself away

22:17.085 --> 22:18.377
American.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.421
- American.
- American.

22:20.589 --> 22:23.507
American. You know,
it's a very hard language.

22:24.634 --> 22:25.676
Let's do it again.
