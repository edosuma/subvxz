00:01.168 --> 00:04.102
GROVER: Lieutenant Chin Ho Kelly
fancies himself as

00:04.137 --> 00:05.170
the pancake master.

00:05.205 --> 00:07.539
But in a few minutes,

00:07.574 --> 00:10.809
you're gonna find out that he
has got nothing on your old man.

00:10.844 --> 00:12.444
(laughs)

00:13.480 --> 00:15.814
(sighs):
Ah.

00:15.849 --> 00:18.316
I call this...

00:18.351 --> 00:21.720
my pineapple papaya
pancake surprise.

00:21.755 --> 00:23.388
Needs another "P," pecans.

00:23.423 --> 00:24.523
Next time, next time.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.092
You know, I do
all the cooking

00:27.127 --> 00:29.361
around here, and your mother
has the nerve to tell me,

00:29.396 --> 00:31.363
"The only thing
that belongs in pancakes

00:31.398 --> 00:33.065
are blueberries
and chocolate chips."

00:33.100 --> 00:35.667
Well, you know what I heard
when she said that, don't you?

00:35.702 --> 00:37.836
Challenge.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.838
Right, right, um...

00:39.873 --> 00:41.406
pancake challenge.

00:41.441 --> 00:43.475
I feel you.

00:43.510 --> 00:45.644
I tell you something, son,
I really value these times

00:45.679 --> 00:47.712
we get to spend together, Will.

00:47.747 --> 00:50.749
Father and son,
little man, big man,

00:50.784 --> 00:52.851
breaking bread, bonding.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.420
Reminds me of the times
I spent with your grandfather.

00:55.455 --> 00:57.523
Wow, epic fail.

00:59.526 --> 01:01.426
You know, last week
I was reading an article

01:01.461 --> 01:03.562
in<i> The Advertiser.</i>

01:03.597 --> 01:05.597
It was talking about
the effect that these screens

01:05.632 --> 01:07.099
have on young people.

01:07.134 --> 01:08.200
The director
of neuroscience

01:08.235 --> 01:10.836
at UCLA said that
the fix that you get

01:10.871 --> 01:13.271
from being on that
phone all the time

01:13.306 --> 01:15.574
is equivalent to
electronic cocaine.

01:15.609 --> 01:18.677
And Chinese researchers
call it "digital heroin."

01:18.712 --> 01:20.412
You know what I call it?

01:20.447 --> 01:22.481
I call it "If you don't
put that damn thing down,

01:22.516 --> 01:24.516
I'm throwing it
out the window."

01:24.551 --> 01:26.418
Sorry.

01:26.453 --> 01:28.420
Down. Thank you.

01:28.455 --> 01:30.489
Now we can spend
some real quality

01:30.524 --> 01:34.459
family father and son
time together.

01:34.494 --> 01:35.460
(phone chimes)

01:35.495 --> 01:36.461
(doorbell rings)

01:36.496 --> 01:37.496
Oh, Dad, that's Grace.

01:37.531 --> 01:38.530
We're gonna walk together,

01:38.565 --> 01:40.132
so I'll see you later.

01:40.167 --> 01:41.533
Wait, wait,
where you going?

01:41.568 --> 01:43.401
By my clock, you got
another 40 minutes

01:43.436 --> 01:44.436
before your first class.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.571
Why don't you go
answer the door,

01:46.606 --> 01:48.640
get your little girlfriend,
bring her into the kitchen.

01:48.675 --> 01:50.876
We'll sit down
and have breakfast

01:50.911 --> 01:53.178
like civilized people.

01:55.182 --> 01:56.482
(sighs)

02:05.458 --> 02:06.691
(singsongy):
Chin Ho Kelly.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.827
Do you hear that sizzling?

02:08.862 --> 02:11.696
Look at that
golden brown deliciousness.

02:11.731 --> 02:14.633
Beat that, pancake master.

02:14.668 --> 02:16.602
Eat your heart out, Chin.

02:19.606 --> 02:20.705
Morning, Mr. Grover.

02:20.740 --> 02:22.707
Well, good morning, Grace.

02:22.742 --> 02:23.842
How are you?

02:23.877 --> 02:24.843
Good.

02:24.878 --> 02:26.211
You are just in time.

02:26.246 --> 02:27.846
Have a seat.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.514
Sit down and relax.

02:29.549 --> 02:34.352
And prepare to
taste greatness.

02:34.387 --> 02:36.922
(quietly):
Just humor him.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.634
(whispering):
Really?

02:49.669 --> 02:51.637
(whispering):
Yeah.

02:56.343 --> 02:57.943
I know, seriously.

02:57.978 --> 02:59.144
(chuckles)

02:59.179 --> 03:02.547
You know you two are sitting
right next to each other, right?

03:02.582 --> 03:06.484
Romeo and Juliet,
put down the phones.

03:06.519 --> 03:08.353
Both of you.

03:08.388 --> 03:11.623
These fluffy, light cakes
of deliciousness

03:11.658 --> 03:14.293
deserve your full and
undivided attention.

03:17.564 --> 03:18.597
Oh, my God,
that's disgusting.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.598
What you talking about?

03:19.633 --> 03:20.632
You haven't even tried 'em yet!

03:20.667 --> 03:22.568
I think I'm gonna throw up.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.837
Hang on.

03:25.872 --> 03:27.239
Give it up.

03:36.683 --> 03:39.351
He's dead, isn't he?

03:40.954 --> 03:42.787
(indistinct police radio
chatter, car doors close)

03:42.822 --> 03:44.589
LUKELA:
Harbormaster called it in.

03:44.624 --> 03:47.626
Body was here when
he showed up for work.

03:52.899 --> 03:56.701
Guy's been cut open and hung up
like some prized catch.

03:56.736 --> 03:58.336
His wallet was
on the dock.

03:58.371 --> 04:01.373
His name's Sam Harrison
from Pennsylvania.

04:01.408 --> 04:02.741
Yeah, a photo of
this guy popped up

04:02.776 --> 04:04.943
in my kid's phone
at breakfast.

04:04.978 --> 04:08.013
And the photo's trending on
social media; you believe that?

04:08.048 --> 04:09.781
It's all everybody's
talking about.

04:09.816 --> 04:12.484
I'm thinking that's
what the killer wanted.

04:12.519 --> 04:15.820
Yeah, well, whoever killed this
guy didn't just want him dead.

04:15.855 --> 04:18.724
They're trying to
make a statement.

04:21.094 --> 04:24.630
<i>(Hawaii Five-O</i>
theme song plays)

04:55.495 --> 04:56.795
PROTESTORS (chanting):
Kamekona, you're no good!

04:56.830 --> 04:58.730
Treat your workers
like you should!

04:58.765 --> 05:00.532
Kamekona, you're no good!

05:00.567 --> 05:01.966
Treat your workers
like you should!

05:02.001 --> 05:04.703
FLIPPA: ...three, four, we don't
want this shirt no more!

05:04.738 --> 05:06.805
One, two, three four,

05:06.840 --> 05:08.873
we don't want
this shirt no more!

05:08.908 --> 05:11.910
KAMEKONA:
Ugh. Finally.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.611
Kamekona, you're no good!

05:13.646 --> 05:14.746
Treat your workers
like you should!

05:14.781 --> 05:16.848
Took you long enough.

05:16.883 --> 05:18.550
Please tell me
this is not

05:18.585 --> 05:20.518
the, uh, the emergency
you called us about.

05:20.553 --> 05:23.088
Dang right. You got
to arrest this guy.

05:23.123 --> 05:24.823
And get him off my beach!

05:24.858 --> 05:26.558
Your cousin?
- Yes.

05:26.593 --> 05:27.992
The one you told me
that you loved

05:28.027 --> 05:29.728
more than your first
shave ice stand?

05:29.763 --> 05:30.862
Not anymore.
He's dead to me.

05:30.897 --> 05:32.731
He got my workers
to unionize;

05:32.766 --> 05:33.832
now they're all
on strike.

05:33.867 --> 05:35.500
Excuse me.

05:35.535 --> 05:38.703
Uh... we've talked about
this before, yeah?

05:38.738 --> 05:40.705
About emergencies.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.742
And that they have to be
actual emergencies, remember?

05:43.777 --> 05:45.377
Now, a labor dispute,

05:45.412 --> 05:47.979
it's just like a flat tire;
it's not an emergency.

05:48.014 --> 05:51.750
Brah, I haven't sold a
single shrimp all morning.

05:51.785 --> 05:53.385
You got to throw
them all in Halawa

05:53.420 --> 05:54.786
or they gonna
kill my business.

05:54.821 --> 05:56.588
Can't do that.

05:56.623 --> 05:58.656
Why not? - 'Cause this
is public property.

05:58.691 --> 06:01.726
Also, uh, it is perfectly legal
for someone to engage

06:01.761 --> 06:04.429
in a peaceful protest
against what they feel

06:04.464 --> 06:05.764
are unfair working conditions.

06:05.799 --> 06:07.699
Unfair?

06:07.734 --> 06:10.735
I haven't missed
a single paycheck.

06:10.770 --> 06:11.803
It ain't about that.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.538
We get paid pennies
for what we do.

06:13.573 --> 06:14.806
We don't get
no health, no dental,

06:14.841 --> 06:16.775
no time and a half
for overtime.

06:16.810 --> 06:19.711
And every Christmas,

06:19.746 --> 06:22.147
he forces me to dress
like an elf.

06:22.182 --> 06:24.682
To bring joy
to the children.

06:24.717 --> 06:26.117
It's humiliating!

06:26.152 --> 06:27.719
STEVE:
So clearly you both have

06:27.754 --> 06:29.788
very strong opinions
about all this, but like I said,

06:29.823 --> 06:31.923
labor disputes are out
of Five-O's jurisdiction.

06:31.958 --> 06:33.691
So you guys are gonna
have to figure this out

06:33.726 --> 06:35.527
by yourself, all right?
If you can't arrest him,

06:35.562 --> 06:38.930
at least buy a delicious
breakfast shrimp loco moco.

06:38.965 --> 06:40.765
DANNY: Well, I-I definitely
can't do that.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.200
That would be crossing
a picket line.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.535
I'm from a union family.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.969
And I'm a friend
of the working man.

06:45.004 --> 06:47.505
Crossing the line is just
something that we do not do.

06:47.540 --> 06:48.640
Socialist.

06:48.675 --> 06:49.808
How about you, McGarrett?

06:49.843 --> 06:52.811
(phone ringing)

06:52.846 --> 06:54.813
Excuse me,
just for a second, please.

06:54.848 --> 06:56.515
Yeah, Chin.

06:57.884 --> 06:59.818
Yeah, yeah, yeah, tell him
I'll be right there.

06:59.853 --> 07:01.019
All right.

07:01.054 --> 07:03.121
Hey, listen, we just caught
our second homicide for the day.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.989
Guess the Coast Guard just
fished a body out of the water.

07:05.024 --> 07:05.823
Do me a favor,

07:05.858 --> 07:06.691
would you stay here
and make sure

07:06.726 --> 07:08.793
these two don't
kill each other please?

07:08.828 --> 07:10.228
I'll meet you back at
the shop in a little bit.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.464
To-go bag?
- I got to go. Sorry.

07:12.499 --> 07:14.766
I thought we was<i> ohana.</i>

07:14.801 --> 07:17.101
NOELANI: She was found floating
about five miles offshore.

07:17.136 --> 07:18.803
Judging from the state
of decomp, she's been dead

07:18.838 --> 07:21.072
and in the water
for three or four days.

07:21.107 --> 07:22.740
Cause of death?

07:22.775 --> 07:24.876
Multiple blunt force trauma
to the back of the head.

07:24.911 --> 07:25.910
Multiple?

07:25.946 --> 07:27.879
So then there's no chance
she slipped off the boat

07:27.914 --> 07:28.746
and hit her head?

07:28.782 --> 07:30.915
Correct.
This is definitely a homicide.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.116
We got an I.D.?

07:32.151 --> 07:33.251
Nothing on her person,

07:33.286 --> 07:34.853
and her prints
weren't in the system.

07:34.888 --> 07:36.721
She does have
an interesting tattoo, though.

07:39.692 --> 07:41.793
I ran it through the database
and came up empty.

07:41.828 --> 07:43.895
A number like that must
have a specific meaning.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.998
Maybe we find out what that is,
and we find out who she is.

07:47.033 --> 07:48.967
You know what? I'm gonna reach
out to the Shoah Foundation,

07:49.002 --> 07:50.735
ask them about this.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.637
The Shoah Foundation?
Yeah, it looks like a tattoo

07:52.672 --> 07:54.939
from a World War Two
concentration camp.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.941
NOELANI:
Lieutenant, this woman

07:56.976 --> 07:57.875
is in her 30s.

07:57.911 --> 08:00.645
How could she have been
in the Holocaust?

08:04.584 --> 08:06.885
GROVER:<i> Turns out</i>
<i>our prize catch this morning,</i>

08:06.920 --> 08:07.886
<i>Sam Harrison,</i>

08:07.921 --> 08:10.989
has himself
a pile of enemies.

08:11.024 --> 08:13.157
Oh, he liked to hunt exotic animals.
That's right.

08:13.192 --> 08:14.726
The more exotic,
the more endangered,

08:14.761 --> 08:16.661
the better, as far
as he was concerned.

08:16.696 --> 08:17.896
Which, I'm sure
you would guess,

08:17.931 --> 08:19.597
would turn him into
persona non grata

08:19.632 --> 08:21.165
amongst the animal
rights groups.

08:21.200 --> 08:22.834
Right, those people
can be pretty nuts.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.736
So you're thinking one of them
targeted Harrison.

08:24.771 --> 08:25.803
Yeah, that's what
I'm thinking,

08:25.838 --> 08:27.005
and it was probably
a shark lover.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.673
Oh, he killed a shark, too?

08:28.708 --> 08:29.807
No, but he wanted to.

08:29.842 --> 08:31.876
You see,
for the last few months,

08:31.911 --> 08:34.679
Harrison's been dying
to bag a great white.

08:34.714 --> 08:37.549
He traveled to Australia,
he traveled to New Zealand,

08:37.584 --> 08:39.651
Africa, Dominican Republic.

08:39.686 --> 08:41.085
Struck out every place,
so he decided to

08:41.120 --> 08:42.787
try his luck here on Oahu.

08:42.822 --> 08:44.055
Sharks are a family god here.

08:44.090 --> 08:46.925
So if locals found out that he
was here to kill a great white,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.960
they'd probably want to do
the same thing to him.

08:48.995 --> 08:50.295
Boom.

08:50.330 --> 08:51.796
So anybody specific?

08:51.831 --> 08:53.298
This lady.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.934
Her name's
Lily O'Neill.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.969
She's very big in the
conservation world.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.905
They call her...
the Shark Whisperer.

09:00.940 --> 09:02.740
No, I've heard of her.

09:02.775 --> 09:04.008
She free-dives with sharks

09:04.043 --> 09:07.812
to show people that they're not
as dangerous as everyone thinks.

09:07.847 --> 09:09.948
But what makes you think that she's
involved? Well, she's been shaming

09:09.983 --> 09:12.817
Harrison online ever since
he made public

09:12.852 --> 09:14.986
his desire to go shark hunting.

09:15.021 --> 09:18.623
But then when she found out
he was actually coming here,

09:18.658 --> 09:21.025
threats started pouring in. DANNY: "Better
think twice about what you're here to do,

09:21.060 --> 09:22.093
"or trust me,

09:22.128 --> 09:24.128
you won't be the only one
hunting for a trophy."

09:24.163 --> 09:26.130
And there's a dozen
more of those.

09:26.165 --> 09:27.365
Okay, hang on.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.268
So, Lily is passionate
about protecting sharks.

09:30.303 --> 09:32.170
Yes, she won't hesitate
to call someone out

09:32.205 --> 09:34.706
if she believes that
they're a threat to them,

09:34.741 --> 09:36.908
but she's never once
resorted to violence.

09:36.943 --> 09:39.010
I think this is the first time
somebody actually

09:39.045 --> 09:41.646
took this thing
right to her doorstep.

09:41.681 --> 09:42.681
Maybe she decided
to step her game up.

DANNY:
Lily O'Neill?

10:41.741 --> 10:43.107
Yeah?

10:43.142 --> 10:45.877
Five-O.

10:45.912 --> 10:47.445
Look, when I found out
what Harrison was planning,

10:47.480 --> 10:50.181
I admit,
I got a little carried away.

10:50.216 --> 10:51.783
But those were just words, okay?

10:51.818 --> 10:54.819
I mean,
as awful as that guy was,

10:54.854 --> 10:56.721
he didn't deserve
to die that way.

10:56.756 --> 10:58.456
Besides,
killing Harrison

10:58.491 --> 10:59.791
accomplishes nothing.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.092
The work people like me
are doing,

11:01.127 --> 11:01.993
educating the public

11:02.028 --> 11:03.928
and fighting
to get legislation passed,

11:03.963 --> 11:06.764
that is gonna do a lot more
to protect the shark population

11:06.799 --> 11:08.833
than taking out
one single hunter.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.270
KONO:
So you believe her?

11:12.305 --> 11:14.272
DANNY: I'll have HPD
look into her alibi,

11:14.307 --> 11:15.907
but I'm pretty sure
it's gonna check out.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.975
Okay, so what's our next move?

11:18.010 --> 11:19.977
I don't know, I think maybe
we're looking at this wrong.

11:20.012 --> 11:20.978
She makes a good point.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.880
People like her
are not gonna go kill somebody,

11:22.915 --> 11:25.450
uh, especially if it doesn't
help their cause, you know?

11:25.485 --> 11:27.919
Okay, so maybe it wasn't
an activist who killed Harrison.

11:27.954 --> 11:31.122
Right, just somebody who
wanted us to think that it was.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.161
Jerry, what do you got?

11:37.196 --> 11:38.329
Chin was right.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.897
I spoke to the
Shoah Foundation

11:39.932 --> 11:42.033
and the tattoo on
our Jane Doe's arm

11:42.068 --> 11:43.835
matches the
concentration camp I.D.

11:43.870 --> 11:46.971
of one Itzhak Rozen,

11:47.006 --> 11:48.940
a Holocaust survivor who
was held at Auschwitz.

11:48.975 --> 11:50.208
After World War II,

11:50.243 --> 11:53.277
he settled in New York and died
last year at the age of 83.

11:53.312 --> 11:55.847
His only surviving relative
was his granddaughter.

11:56.883 --> 11:58.249
That's her.

11:58.284 --> 12:00.151
That's our Jane Doe.

12:00.186 --> 12:01.152
Her name is
Leia Rozen.

12:01.187 --> 12:03.287
She also lived in New York
and by all accounts,

12:03.322 --> 12:05.857
she and granddad
were pretty close.

12:05.892 --> 12:08.126
I can only assume she got the
tattoo as a way of honoring him.

12:08.161 --> 12:11.763
All right, we, uh, we know
what Leia was doing in Hawaii?

12:11.798 --> 12:13.131
No, but get this:

12:13.166 --> 12:16.901
her last credit card
purchase was on Molokai,

12:16.936 --> 12:18.536
specifically,
in Kalaupapa.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.538
Kalaupapa?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.140
You mean the old leprosy colony?

12:22.175 --> 12:24.108
Yeah.

12:24.143 --> 12:25.443
Well, I mean, that place
hasn't been under quarantine

12:25.478 --> 12:26.811
since the late '60s,
but travel there

12:26.846 --> 12:28.346
is still
heavily restricted.

12:28.381 --> 12:30.414
Yeah, she must've been invited
by someone who lives there.

12:30.449 --> 12:31.849
It's the only way
you can visit.

12:31.884 --> 12:34.118
Okay, uh, do me a favor,
will you, Jerry.

12:34.153 --> 12:35.987
Contact the sheriff of Molokai.

12:36.022 --> 12:37.789
Tell them that Chin and I
are gonna come over.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.857
Sure thing.
Oh, and just FYI,

12:39.892 --> 12:41.392
Hmm? - I heard that once
you get to Molokai,

12:41.427 --> 12:42.493
it's still a
90-minute hike

12:42.528 --> 12:44.095
down to Kalaupapa.

12:44.130 --> 12:45.830
Half that if you go by mule.

12:45.865 --> 12:47.899
I don't think either of
those things are gonna happen,

12:47.934 --> 12:49.133
but thank you.

12:49.168 --> 12:51.002
<i>(helicopter blades whirring)</i>

13:03.149 --> 13:05.884
(helicopter blades whirring)

13:32.511 --> 13:33.845
Aloha.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.179
You must be
Commander McGarrett.

13:35.214 --> 13:36.614
Yes, indeed.

13:36.649 --> 13:38.149
Lieutenant Kelly?
Aloha.

13:38.184 --> 13:40.551
I'm Sheriff Alana.
Welcome to Kalaupapa.

13:40.586 --> 13:41.853
Thanks for meeting us.

13:41.888 --> 13:43.321
Glad to be of help.

13:43.356 --> 13:45.122
Like I told
Special Consultant Ortega,

13:45.157 --> 13:47.291
you are welcome to use
our station while you're here.

13:47.326 --> 13:50.328
And my department will assist
in any way we can.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.596
We appreciate that.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.464
I took the liberty of
looking into the victim.

13:53.499 --> 13:54.866
Apparently,
she arrived here

13:54.901 --> 13:56.934
two weeks ago as part
of a volunteer group.

13:56.969 --> 13:58.970
So I'm gonna take you
to meet Bill Walker,

13:59.005 --> 14:00.504
the volunteer coordinator.
- Okay.

14:00.539 --> 14:01.873
He should have
more information.

14:01.908 --> 14:03.107
Great, thanks.

14:09.348 --> 14:12.350
Kalaupapa is a National
Historical Park,

14:12.385 --> 14:15.019
so access here is restricted.

14:15.054 --> 14:17.388
You have to be either a
resident or a volunteer

14:17.423 --> 14:18.422
in order to visit.

14:18.457 --> 14:20.258
And what do
the volunteers do here?

14:20.293 --> 14:22.159
Mainly, they help with
the upkeep of the grounds

14:22.194 --> 14:24.028
and with whatever
the patients need.

14:24.063 --> 14:26.163
Patients? I thought
leprosy had been cured.

14:26.198 --> 14:28.466
Actually, we prefer to
call it Hansen's disease.

14:28.501 --> 14:29.767
And it was.

14:29.803 --> 14:33.905
But there's still a small number
of former patients living here.

14:33.940 --> 14:37.008
The trauma they suffered from
being ostracized by society

14:37.043 --> 14:39.010
made it difficult for
many of them to leave,

14:39.045 --> 14:41.045
even after the
quarantine ended.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.914
How many people
live here in total?

14:42.949 --> 14:45.583
Well, between the patients,
their families,

14:45.618 --> 14:49.020
government workers
and the handful of folks

14:49.055 --> 14:50.688
who work
at the small businesses here,

14:50.723 --> 14:52.891
a little over
a hundred.

14:56.629 --> 14:57.962
ALANA:
Hey, Bill.

15:00.333 --> 15:02.066
Hey, Alana.

15:03.102 --> 15:06.237
(Bill grunts, chuckles)

15:06.272 --> 15:08.072
Good afternoon.
How are you today?

15:08.107 --> 15:09.941
ALANA (chuckling):
I'm all right.

15:11.010 --> 15:12.276
Good to see you.

15:12.311 --> 15:13.945
BILL:
Uh-huh.

15:13.980 --> 15:16.681
Bill, uh, these gentlemen are
with the Five-O Task Force

15:16.716 --> 15:17.649
on Oahu.

15:17.684 --> 15:19.483
They would like to ask
you some questions.

15:19.518 --> 15:22.053
Well, what can I do for you?

15:22.088 --> 15:24.221
Well, we'd like to
ask you some questions

15:24.256 --> 15:27.258
about one of your volunteers
here, Leia Rozen.

15:29.595 --> 15:33.297
We found her body off the coast
of Oahu this morning, sir.

15:33.332 --> 15:34.966
Leia's dead?
- Yes, sir.

15:35.001 --> 15:37.368
We, uh, we think
she may have been murdered

15:37.403 --> 15:39.503
while she was here
on this island.

15:39.538 --> 15:41.539
I'm very sorry.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.578
What can you tell us about her?

15:47.613 --> 15:52.316
Huh. A very...
a very nice young woman.

15:52.351 --> 15:54.418
Uh, quiet,
but hardworking.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.454
Uh, the group
that she came with

15:56.489 --> 15:58.255
left, uh,
four days ago.

15:58.290 --> 16:01.659
Uh, Leia wanted to stay
on Molokai a little longer

16:01.694 --> 16:02.860
to do some sightseeing.

16:02.895 --> 16:06.630
I see. Do you, uh, do you
happen to know where she went?

16:06.665 --> 16:11.035
No. Uh... uh...

16:11.070 --> 16:12.770
there's a bungalow
just down the road

16:12.805 --> 16:15.272
where we house
our volunteers and, uh,

16:15.307 --> 16:17.541
the next group wasn't coming in
until next month,

16:17.576 --> 16:21.579
so I... I told Leia
she was welcome to stay there.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.750
This is her bungalow right here.

16:31.323 --> 16:34.058
She had the back room,
all to herself.

16:34.093 --> 16:35.226
Back here.

16:47.840 --> 16:50.107
It looks like Leia
might have done some exploring.

16:50.142 --> 16:52.810
Or had plans to.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.612
Maybe she went walking
along the cliff,

16:54.647 --> 16:57.681
and got too close to
the edge, fell off?

16:57.716 --> 17:00.184
ALANA: That definitely
would have killed her.

17:00.219 --> 17:02.219
It's a 1,600 foot
drop into the ocean.

17:02.254 --> 17:03.754
Yeah, except her injuries
aren't consistent

17:03.789 --> 17:05.189
with that kind
of a fall.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.593
Chin...

17:09.628 --> 17:11.262
What's up?

17:14.467 --> 17:17.568
A Glock 26 right there.

17:17.603 --> 17:19.637
Leia Rozen came here
to help people,

17:19.672 --> 17:20.671
so why would she need a gun?

17:44.463 --> 17:45.563
That's funny.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.099
He's a natural.

17:48.134 --> 17:50.301
(neighs)

17:51.537 --> 17:53.671
Must be nice
taking a chopper down here.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.141
(grunts)

17:57.176 --> 17:58.776
Pretty sure my ass is broken.

17:58.811 --> 18:00.644
Nah, your ass
looks fine to me.

18:00.679 --> 18:02.613
Funny.

18:02.648 --> 18:04.482
Hey, uh, Eric, this is Bill.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.783
Bill's gonna take you
to the bungalow

18:05.818 --> 18:07.151
where our victim was staying.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.686
Need you to process that
right away.

18:08.721 --> 18:09.587
Right.
- Hello, Eric.

18:09.622 --> 18:11.856
Uh, let me help you
with your things.

18:11.891 --> 18:14.225
Oh, thank you. Whoa.

18:17.730 --> 18:19.697
Thanks, Bill.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.565
Real smooth.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.634
What? I wasn't
expecting that.

18:23.669 --> 18:25.302
You coming?

18:25.337 --> 18:26.637
Yep, yep!
Right behind you, buddy.

18:26.672 --> 18:28.406
You could have
warned me.

18:29.575 --> 18:30.608
Hey, Bill.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.542
Hey.
- Hey.

18:31.577 --> 18:34.678
So, my office just got in touch

18:34.713 --> 18:37.281
with the other volunteers
Ms. Rozen was here with.

18:37.316 --> 18:39.617
And according to them,
she never mentioned having a gun

18:39.652 --> 18:42.319
or made any indication
that she might need one.

18:42.354 --> 18:43.654
The only thing
I could think of

18:43.689 --> 18:45.156
is that she had it
for protection.

18:45.191 --> 18:46.557
Protection from what?

18:46.592 --> 18:47.758
This is Kalaupapa.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.593
We don't see
much crime here.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.529
Maybe it wasn't this place
she was worried about.

18:51.564 --> 18:53.597
You think she was running
from someone?

18:53.632 --> 18:55.566
It's certainly possible.
I mean, this is a...

18:55.601 --> 18:57.234
it's a very isolated
part of the world,

18:57.269 --> 18:58.569
travel here is restricted.

18:58.604 --> 18:59.737
I can't think of a better place

18:59.772 --> 19:00.805
to hide out
if someone was after me.

19:06.345 --> 19:08.245
NOELANI:
<i>As expected,</i>

19:08.280 --> 19:09.547
Mr. Harrison's cause of death

19:09.582 --> 19:11.182
was blood loss
from a central incision

19:11.217 --> 19:12.516
on his thoracic cavity.

19:12.551 --> 19:14.418
But I did find
something unexpected.

19:14.453 --> 19:15.653
What's that?

19:17.356 --> 19:19.423
See this part of the wound
right here?

19:19.458 --> 19:20.658
Yeah.

19:20.693 --> 19:22.660
NOELANI:
Take a look at the pattern.

19:22.695 --> 19:23.928
Those look like bite marks.
- They are.

19:23.963 --> 19:25.896
In fact,
they're bite marks of a shark.

19:25.931 --> 19:27.498
A great white, to be exact.

19:27.533 --> 19:28.732
Wait, hang on.
You're saying that

19:28.767 --> 19:30.267
in addition to
being split open,

19:30.302 --> 19:31.735
this guy had an encounter
with Jaws?

19:31.770 --> 19:32.770
That's right.

19:32.805 --> 19:33.604
Well, I guess Harrison

19:33.639 --> 19:34.972
had his little shark
hunt after all.

19:35.007 --> 19:36.340
Yep.

19:36.375 --> 19:37.141
And from the looks of it,

19:37.176 --> 19:38.776
the killer attempted
to hide the fact

19:38.811 --> 19:40.744
that he was bitten
by making this incision.

19:40.779 --> 19:42.613
Well, then whoever pulled
Harrison out on the water,

19:42.648 --> 19:43.781
that must be our guy.

19:43.816 --> 19:45.683
Yeah, well, it's illegal to
hunt great whites in Hawaii,

19:45.718 --> 19:46.850
so there wouldn't
be too many people

19:46.885 --> 19:48.719
willing to
arrange a hunt.

19:48.754 --> 19:50.788
At least our suspect
pool would be small.

19:50.823 --> 19:51.756
Well, despite that,
I don't think we'll find them

19:51.791 --> 19:54.792
advertising on Yelp,
so how we gonna find 'em?

19:54.827 --> 19:57.428
There's one person
who might know.

19:57.463 --> 19:58.529
One, two, three, four!

19:58.564 --> 19:59.997
We don't want his shrimp
no more!

20:00.032 --> 20:01.432
KAMEKONA:
Let me get this right.

20:01.467 --> 20:02.866
At Lieutenant
Kelly's birthday,

20:02.901 --> 20:04.868
Chicago here fills
his thick head

20:04.903 --> 20:07.438
with the idea
of unionizing.

20:07.473 --> 20:09.773
And then this morning,
McGarrett and Williams

20:09.808 --> 20:13.544
refuse to do their civic duty
by squashing this unrest.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.713
Now Five-O wants my help?

20:15.748 --> 20:18.449
Sorry, sistah.
Not how it works.

20:18.484 --> 20:19.950
Oh, come on now,
big fella.

20:19.985 --> 20:22.019
Kamekona,
this isn't just about us.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.021
If you help us find the
person we're looking for,

20:24.056 --> 20:25.656
you'd be helping
the mano,

20:25.691 --> 20:28.692
which you know is sacred to
a lot of people in Hawaii,

20:28.727 --> 20:30.794
including me.

20:30.829 --> 20:33.497
The shark is
my family's<i> aumakua.</i>

20:33.532 --> 20:34.865
Mine, too.

20:34.900 --> 20:37.301
Then we need
to protect them.

20:38.370 --> 20:40.371
Okay, I'll help.

20:40.406 --> 20:42.339
But just for the record,

20:42.374 --> 20:44.808
this for the sharks,
not you two crime-fighters.

20:44.843 --> 20:46.343
Noted. What you got?

20:46.378 --> 20:48.812
It's been an open secret.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.682
Local restaurants be serving up
shark fin soup,

20:51.717 --> 20:53.417
although it's been banned.

20:53.452 --> 20:55.753
Economics 101 says,

20:55.788 --> 20:58.522
where there's demand,
there will be be supply.

20:58.557 --> 21:00.324
That's where
these finners come in.

21:00.359 --> 21:02.793
There's only a handful
of 'em on this rock,

21:02.828 --> 21:05.529
and I'm betting
that's who you want to call

21:05.564 --> 21:06.997
when you're setting up
a shark hunt.

21:07.032 --> 21:09.033
That's good.
You have some names?

21:09.068 --> 21:11.535
Yeah. Why don't you go
buy some shrimp tacos?

21:11.570 --> 21:13.937
I'll go write them down
while you wait.

21:13.972 --> 21:17.574
Kamekona, we can't
take sides. Come on.

21:17.609 --> 21:19.777
By supporting that<i> lolo's</i>
stupid picket line,

21:19.812 --> 21:21.545
you already chose a side.

21:21.580 --> 21:22.780
GROVER: You know,
can I just say something

21:22.815 --> 21:25.416
as a former police union rep?

21:25.451 --> 21:28.519
These kind of showdowns,
nobody wins.

21:28.554 --> 21:31.822
And you two are family,
so you got even more to lose.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.090
You should know,

21:33.125 --> 21:36.027
you single-handedly sabotaged
my business.

21:38.130 --> 21:40.898
Okay, I-I might've mentioned
the word "union"

21:40.933 --> 21:43.701
to Flippa at the party,
but I also asked him

21:43.736 --> 21:45.402
to get me a second
piece of cake

21:45.437 --> 21:46.937
and some diet soda,
so as far as I'm concerned,

21:46.972 --> 21:49.907
that was nothing but a lot
of chitchat and small talk.

21:49.942 --> 21:52.609
Nobody was trying
to ruin your business.

21:52.644 --> 21:55.846
If that was an apology,
I didn't hear the words.

22:05.624 --> 22:08.792
Kamekona, my man,

22:08.827 --> 22:10.828
I'm sorry.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.597
There. You feel better now?

22:13.632 --> 22:14.932
Nah.
- Oh, brother.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.668
Words are not gonna
solve my problem.

22:17.703 --> 22:19.136
Yes, they will.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.072
Listen, you're known
all over this island as being

22:22.107 --> 22:24.575
a very smart
and very shrewd businessman,

22:24.610 --> 22:27.778
so I know you know good help
is hard to find.

22:27.813 --> 22:31.982
Now, if you just put
your pride aside for a minute,

22:32.017 --> 22:33.851
I'm sure you can come up
with a solution

22:33.886 --> 22:36.019
that both of you can live with.

22:36.054 --> 22:37.855
And on the low, probably one

22:37.890 --> 22:40.457
you'll end up
benefitting from, so...

22:40.492 --> 22:41.859
(sighs)

22:41.894 --> 22:43.861
I'll take it
into advisement.

22:43.896 --> 22:45.696
All right, you do that.
In the meantime,

22:45.731 --> 22:47.664
let's have those names.

22:47.699 --> 22:49.433
Wait here. I'll go get them.

22:49.468 --> 22:50.734
KONO:
Family drama.

22:50.769 --> 22:55.139
This is why I never do
business with family.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.578
Oh, hey.

23:01.613 --> 23:05.182
I'm sorry. I... I've just
never seen anybody do this.

23:05.217 --> 23:07.918
Really? What about on TV?

23:08.954 --> 23:11.922
I don't watch a lot of TV.

23:11.957 --> 23:13.924
You looking for fingerprints?

23:13.959 --> 23:15.159
Yep. We know our victim
was killed up close,

23:15.194 --> 23:16.827
so we want to see
if anyone other than her

23:16.862 --> 23:19.630
or any of the other volunteers
may have been in here.

23:20.666 --> 23:24.034
So, how do you find
a fingerprint?

23:25.704 --> 23:28.472
Well, I'll show you.
Come check this out.

23:30.642 --> 23:33.644
All right. First,
we take our aluminum powder,

23:33.679 --> 23:35.946
then we take our dusting brush
and we dip it in.

23:35.981 --> 23:37.581
Not too much.

23:37.616 --> 23:38.949
(exhales sharply)

23:38.984 --> 23:41.985
And then, we give our area

23:42.020 --> 23:45.489
a few gentle swirls...

23:46.892 --> 23:49.460
The powder will pick up
a latent print.

23:50.996 --> 23:52.796
(laughs)
Baby.

23:52.831 --> 23:54.031
All right.

23:54.066 --> 23:55.966
Now, we take our tape,

23:56.001 --> 23:58.869
like this,

23:58.904 --> 24:01.805
and we stick it, like that.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.507
(straining):
There we go.

24:03.542 --> 24:07.778
And we slowly

24:07.813 --> 24:10.681
lift the print.

24:10.716 --> 24:12.683
Slow.

24:12.718 --> 24:14.084
Got it.

24:14.119 --> 24:17.955
Stick the tape
to the card, like that.

24:17.990 --> 24:19.223
Boom. Voila.

24:19.258 --> 24:22.025
Easy-peasy,
George and Weezy, huh?

24:22.060 --> 24:23.026
(chuckles)

24:23.061 --> 24:23.927
Isn't that something.

24:23.962 --> 24:25.496
Pretty cool, right?
I mean, it leaves

24:25.531 --> 24:26.864
kind of a crazy mess,
but I don't care.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.799
I don't got to clean it up.
(laughs)

24:28.834 --> 24:30.601
Now...
(sighs)

24:30.636 --> 24:33.237
all we got to do is run this

24:33.272 --> 24:34.872
against the millions
of prints in the system.

24:34.907 --> 24:36.707
(camera clicks)

24:36.742 --> 24:39.042
And it'll tell us if
it belonged to Leia,

24:39.077 --> 24:41.946
another volunteer
or someone else.

24:44.716 --> 24:47.618
Thank you for showing me this.
- Eh.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.753
You're welcome.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.722
I'm sorry.

24:51.757 --> 24:53.056
It's okay.

24:53.091 --> 24:56.126
Most people that come here
do the same thing.

24:57.863 --> 25:00.731
So, uh, how long
have you lived here?

25:00.766 --> 25:03.734
My parents sent me here in 1950.

25:03.769 --> 25:06.570
I was, uh, eight years old.

25:06.605 --> 25:08.872
Have you ever been to Oahu?

25:08.907 --> 25:10.641
Never.
- Oh, dude. You got to go.

25:10.676 --> 25:12.643
I know where all
the great eats are.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.114
(chuckles)

25:17.149 --> 25:18.982
Oh, hey, look at that.

25:19.017 --> 25:20.217
Oh, wait, wait,
wait a minute.

25:20.252 --> 25:21.952
Hey, Billy, you know
who that guy is?

25:21.987 --> 25:23.053
(chuckles)
Yeah.

25:23.088 --> 25:25.055
He works the bar downtown,
only, he...

25:25.090 --> 25:27.658
he's not Tony, he's Mikey.

25:32.164 --> 25:33.931
Chin, go around.

25:40.706 --> 25:42.172
♪ ♪

26:05.364 --> 26:06.997
STEVE:
<i>Tony Nguyen.</i>

26:07.032 --> 26:08.966
Las Vegas PD's
been looking for you.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.602
You got outstanding warrants
for theft, assault,

26:11.637 --> 26:12.936
damage to property.

26:12.971 --> 26:16.006
Coming out here to lay
low, that's pretty smart.

26:16.041 --> 26:19.143
Yeah, I'll tell you
what's not smart...

26:20.145 --> 26:21.778
...is bashing
Leia Rozen's head in,

26:21.813 --> 26:22.946
and throwing her
body in the water.

26:22.981 --> 26:24.348
Look at the photograph.

26:24.383 --> 26:26.049
Hey, okay, wait.

26:26.084 --> 26:27.317
Look, that girl came
into the bar a few times,

26:27.352 --> 26:28.752
but I've haven't seen her
in a week.

26:28.787 --> 26:29.886
I had no idea
she was even dead,

26:29.921 --> 26:32.155
and I sure as hell
didn't kill her!

26:32.190 --> 26:34.024
Where were you four days ago?

26:34.059 --> 26:35.959
I was with
my girlfriend.

26:35.994 --> 26:37.194
I work here in town
for six days,

26:37.229 --> 26:38.695
then I go topside for five.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.197
Me and my girl
were in Kaunakakai,

26:40.232 --> 26:42.032
way on the other side
of the island.

26:42.067 --> 26:44.067
I just got back this morning.

26:44.102 --> 26:45.335
All right, let's say
for a minute that that's true.

26:45.370 --> 26:48.105
Your prints were found in the
bungalow where Leia was staying.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.673
How do you explain that?

26:55.080 --> 26:57.981
I was there because
I was selling her a gun. Okay?

26:58.016 --> 26:59.916
Go on.

26:59.951 --> 27:02.219
Last week,
her and some other volunteers

27:02.254 --> 27:03.854
came to the bar to unwind.

27:03.889 --> 27:05.889
After a few drinks,
the lady let it slip

27:05.924 --> 27:07.691
that she was looking
to buy a piece.

27:07.726 --> 27:09.693
A few nights later,

27:09.728 --> 27:12.429
I went over to the bungalow
and I sold her one.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.731
Did she say why
she needed a gun?

27:14.766 --> 27:18.201
She just said something about
wanting to "make things right."

27:18.236 --> 27:20.837
She didn't share any details
and I didn't want to know.

27:20.872 --> 27:24.174
I just wanted to get my money so
I could take my girlfriend away.

27:31.717 --> 27:33.116
If this kid's telling
the truth, then maybe Leia

27:33.151 --> 27:34.885
didn't come here to disappear.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.987
Maybe she came here
to settle a score.

27:37.022 --> 27:39.089
Maybe she was the one
who was after someone.

27:39.124 --> 27:42.259
Yeah, and maybe that someone
got to her first.

27:42.294 --> 27:44.394
JERRY: Okay, so I was going over
Leia Rozen's travel record,

27:44.429 --> 27:45.929
and it definitely appears

27:45.964 --> 27:47.798
that she may have been
chasing someone.

27:47.833 --> 27:50.000
She came to Molokai
straight from Buenos Aires,

27:50.035 --> 27:51.768
and before that,
she was in Spain.

27:51.803 --> 27:54.771
But she'd been globe-hopping
for a better part of the year.

27:54.806 --> 27:57.107
After her grandfather died,
she left New York for Poland,

27:57.142 --> 27:59.943
Rome and Genoa.

27:59.978 --> 28:01.244
She gets around.

28:01.279 --> 28:03.213
Yeah. Woman logged
some serious miles.

28:03.248 --> 28:04.314
You know what, Jerry,
do me a favor.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.183
Go through that list again,
and... and this time,

28:06.218 --> 28:07.784
in order, please.

28:07.819 --> 28:10.287
Okay. Uh, Poland, Rome,

28:10.322 --> 28:13.090
Genoa, Spain, Argentina.

28:13.125 --> 28:15.092
Yeah, Argentina. You know what?

28:15.127 --> 28:17.060
All these countries
have something in common.

28:17.095 --> 28:18.295
What?

28:19.331 --> 28:22.065
They're all stops
along the Nazi ratlines.

28:22.100 --> 28:23.200
Oh, wow. He's right.

28:23.235 --> 28:25.268
How'd I not see that?

28:25.303 --> 28:26.970
Wait a minute, w-what
are the ratlines?

28:27.005 --> 28:28.438
They're the escape routes
that the Nazis used

28:28.473 --> 28:30.373
to disappear
after World War II.

28:30.408 --> 28:33.276
Sympathizers in these countries,
they made fake I.D.s,

28:33.311 --> 28:35.412
passports, the whole nine.

28:35.447 --> 28:37.214
So, we're thinking that
Leia Rozen was here

28:37.249 --> 28:38.815
looking for a Nazi?

28:38.850 --> 28:40.283
Yeah, apparently, one she
was convinced was right here

28:40.318 --> 28:41.218
in Kalaupapa.

28:41.253 --> 28:43.220
Get the feeling that that tattoo

28:43.255 --> 28:45.155
wasn't the only way she was
gonna honor her grandfather.

28:45.190 --> 28:46.190
(exhales)

28:52.297 --> 28:58.769
At Auschwitz there
was an SS-Unterscharfuhrer.

28:58.804 --> 29:00.837
He couldn't have been more than,

29:00.872 --> 29:03.206
what, 19.

29:03.241 --> 29:07.210
He oversaw the barracks
that we were in.

29:07.245 --> 29:10.113
We had nicknames for him,

29:10.148 --> 29:13.784
but I... I never knew
his real name.

29:13.819 --> 29:16.153
But one night,

29:16.188 --> 29:18.455
he dragged me

29:18.490 --> 29:21.358
and my brother and my sister

29:21.393 --> 29:24.327
out of the barracks.

29:24.362 --> 29:28.231
He held a gun to my head,

29:28.266 --> 29:30.333
and made me to choose

29:30.368 --> 29:35.071
which one of them would live.

29:35.106 --> 29:37.107
If I didn't choose,

29:37.142 --> 29:41.011
all three of us would die.

29:41.046 --> 29:46.116
So I did.

29:46.151 --> 29:49.086
I chose.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.522
I don't remember

29:52.557 --> 29:56.326
what happened to that guard.

29:56.361 --> 30:00.997
He fled
when the Soviet Army appeared.

30:01.032 --> 30:06.236
It's difficult to know
that that man

30:06.271 --> 30:10.907
may have gotten away

30:10.942 --> 30:13.544
with what he did.

30:21.086 --> 30:24.154
Well, that SS guard must have
been the person Leia was after.

30:24.189 --> 30:26.923
Leia told Tony Nguyen

30:26.958 --> 30:29.025
she wanted to right a wrong.

30:29.060 --> 30:32.195
What that guard did to Leia's
grandfather certainly qualifies.

30:32.230 --> 30:35.131
Now, that guard, who
was 19 years old, he said,

30:35.166 --> 30:39.536
in 1945, which would make him
about 91 today.

30:39.571 --> 30:42.572
We're saying we think
that Leia Rozen was killed

30:42.607 --> 30:44.574
by a 91-year-old Nazi fugitive.

30:44.609 --> 30:46.243
You know, I don't know.
(sighs)

30:46.278 --> 30:48.578
Maybe.

30:48.613 --> 30:51.281
Yeah, all right. Well, look.
If that is the case,

30:51.316 --> 30:53.383
we're gonna need
to retrace Leia's steps,

30:53.418 --> 30:55.085
talk to the same people she did

30:55.120 --> 30:57.187
and see if we can identify
this guard.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.896
Got to hand it to you,
Mr. Reynolds.

31:05.931 --> 31:07.430
Dolphin excursion's
a pretty good front

31:07.465 --> 31:09.266
for a shark finning operation.

31:09.301 --> 31:11.268
Yeah, I was impressed.
Look, you got the shirt,

31:11.303 --> 31:12.302
and everything.
It's good.

31:12.337 --> 31:14.404
I'm glad you're impressed.

31:14.439 --> 31:17.207
Okay. So do you want the bad
news, or the really bad news?

31:17.242 --> 31:19.242
You pick.

31:19.277 --> 31:22.178
Okay. So the cops came
and searched your boat.

31:22.213 --> 31:25.682
They found half a dozen shark
fins packed in ice below deck.

31:25.717 --> 31:27.183
Depending on
the species,

31:27.218 --> 31:29.185
that's a $30,000 haul.

31:29.220 --> 31:31.288
But it's about a $50,000 fine,

31:31.323 --> 31:33.189
since this is
your second offense.

31:33.224 --> 31:34.624
It's a fish, lady.

31:34.659 --> 31:36.960
Just like the ahi
you throw on the grill,

31:36.995 --> 31:38.561
only bigger.

31:38.596 --> 31:40.330
Except you slice the fins off of
them while they're still alive,

31:40.365 --> 31:42.532
and throw them back in the water
to suffocate and die.

31:42.567 --> 31:44.167
It's not exactly
humane, is it?

31:44.202 --> 31:46.069
People stop
eating the soup,

31:46.104 --> 31:47.470
I'll stop finning
the sharks.

31:47.505 --> 31:49.639
Okay, you're done with
finning sharks, okay.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.241
But let's get to
the really bad news,

31:51.276 --> 31:53.276
which is that we found
blood on your boat.

31:53.311 --> 31:55.111
A lot of blood.
Human blood.

31:55.146 --> 31:56.313
Did some tests, found out
that it belonged

31:56.348 --> 31:58.381
to, uh, Sam Harrison.

31:58.416 --> 32:01.318
You know who
that is, right?

32:01.353 --> 32:03.386
I think that he came
to you, okay,

32:03.421 --> 32:05.121
and said he wanted you
to help him find

32:05.156 --> 32:07.290
a great white shark,
like Roy Scheider, in<i> Jaws.</i>

32:07.325 --> 32:08.658
You know.

32:08.693 --> 32:10.727
Uh, didn't go as planned.

32:10.762 --> 32:12.228
Uh, shark bites the guy.

32:12.263 --> 32:13.330
You can't take him
to the hospital

32:13.365 --> 32:14.364
because you're a shark finner--

32:14.399 --> 32:16.967
it's not good for business--

32:17.002 --> 32:19.002
so you, uh,
you cut him up,

32:19.037 --> 32:20.236
hang him up there
on the dock,

32:20.271 --> 32:22.672
make it look like
a shark-lover did it.

32:22.707 --> 32:24.641
That's my theory.
What do you think?

32:28.413 --> 32:29.479
Harrison got
in touch with me

32:29.514 --> 32:32.248
through a restaurant
I sell to.

32:32.283 --> 32:34.317
Offered me ten grand
to take him out.

32:34.352 --> 32:36.252
Took a couple hours,
but we finally found

32:36.287 --> 32:38.355
a 16-footer off the coast.

32:38.390 --> 32:41.057
I told him it was
a bad idea,

32:41.092 --> 32:43.293
but Harrison wanted to get
in the water without a cage.

32:43.328 --> 32:45.362
Well, big surprise--

32:45.397 --> 32:48.231
the shark charged him.

32:48.266 --> 32:50.033
You can guess
what happened next.

32:50.068 --> 32:53.536
I tried to patch him up
with a first-aid kit.

32:53.571 --> 32:55.171
By the time I got
back to shore,

32:55.206 --> 32:56.239
Harrison was in bad shape.

32:56.274 --> 32:58.442
He's yelling at me to
take him to the hospital.

33:00.211 --> 33:03.780
Look, the whole world wanted
that guy dead anyway.

33:03.815 --> 33:07.684
Trust me, no one's
crying for him.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.686
Yeah, I'd agree with you.

33:09.721 --> 33:11.388
But trust us,

33:11.423 --> 33:14.591
no one's crying
for you either.

33:14.626 --> 33:17.494
ERIC: Okay, this is the guard
Itzhak Rozen was talking about.

33:17.529 --> 33:19.462
His name is Tomas Sauer.

33:19.497 --> 33:22.165
We'll age him up
70 years.

33:24.269 --> 33:26.603
Boom. That's what
he looks like now.

33:26.638 --> 33:29.305
All right, send this picture
to Sheriff Alana.

33:29.340 --> 33:30.607
See if she recognizes
this guy.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.742
On it.

33:32.777 --> 33:34.344
I've got to say, man,
if Tomas actually did

33:34.379 --> 33:36.613
come out here,
it's kind of genius.

33:36.648 --> 33:38.248
The only people that were
coming through Molokai

33:38.283 --> 33:41.384
in the 1940s were leprosy
patients and missionaries.

33:41.419 --> 33:43.219
The chances of Tomas
being discovered

33:43.254 --> 33:44.220
were practically zero.

33:44.255 --> 33:46.423
Well, no one ever said
the Nazis were stupid,

33:46.458 --> 33:47.624
just pure evil.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.392
The sheriff just replied.
What'd she say?

33:49.427 --> 33:50.460
She doesn't recognize
the picture,

33:50.495 --> 33:51.795
but she's gonna
ask around.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.196
Seems like Leia
was pretty sure

33:53.231 --> 33:55.432
that Tomas was at Kalaupapa
at some point.

33:55.467 --> 33:57.434
Maybe it was before
the sheriff got here.

33:57.469 --> 33:59.335
Yeah, maybe we need
to ask somebody

33:59.370 --> 34:03.373
who's been in Kalaupapa
for a longer period of time.

34:03.408 --> 34:07.343
Uh, I, uh, recognize him.

34:07.378 --> 34:10.513
But what you're saying,
that-that couldn't be true.

34:10.548 --> 34:12.382
Why? Who is this guy?

34:12.417 --> 34:15.852
Uh, this is, uh, Allen Smith.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.188
He-he came here
as a missionary

34:18.223 --> 34:19.489
after the war.

34:19.524 --> 34:20.623
He worked in the...

34:20.658 --> 34:22.192
orphanage, where I was.

34:22.227 --> 34:24.160
Married a local girl.

34:24.195 --> 34:26.096
You know, he...

34:26.131 --> 34:27.497
he did a lot
of good work here.

34:27.532 --> 34:29.365
He helped a lot of people.

34:29.400 --> 34:30.800
Mr. Walker, whatever good
this man may have done,

34:30.835 --> 34:33.369
it doesn't make up for what
he did before he got here.

34:33.404 --> 34:35.672
I-I-I understand.

34:35.707 --> 34:37.373
Do you know where he is now?

34:37.408 --> 34:40.610
Well, he moved up
topside 15 years ago.

34:40.645 --> 34:44.447
I believe he has a place
in Mauna Loa, and, uh...

34:44.482 --> 34:46.116
I mean, his daughter can
take you there.

34:46.151 --> 34:47.517
Who's his daughter?

34:47.552 --> 34:49.553
Sheriff Alana.

34:51.789 --> 34:53.690
Allen Smith, Five-O!

35:01.633 --> 35:02.766
Clear.

35:03.801 --> 35:05.702
Clear.

35:05.737 --> 35:08.305
Looks like Tomas
took off in a hurry.

35:11.543 --> 35:15.145
No wonder Sheriff Alana
wasn't returning our calls.

35:15.180 --> 35:16.579
When we sent her
that photograph,

35:16.614 --> 35:18.181
we were basically telling
her and her old man

35:18.216 --> 35:19.216
to get out of town.

35:26.558 --> 35:29.459
All right, get out the BOLO.
Alert TSA and FBI.

35:29.494 --> 35:31.461
Make sure they know that
Alana's a cop, all right?

35:31.496 --> 35:33.897
She's probably armed.

35:33.932 --> 35:36.466
Hey, guys, I got something
you got to see.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.806
You see this?

35:43.841 --> 35:45.542
STEVE:
Yeah, I see that.

35:45.577 --> 35:47.377
Looks like a bleach stain.

35:47.412 --> 35:50.346
I thought so, too, so I ran
my black light over it.

35:50.381 --> 35:53.283
CHIN: You may have found
the crime scene.

35:53.318 --> 35:55.952
Okay, so maybe, uh,
maybe Leia Rozen

35:55.987 --> 35:58.555
comes to this house
to confront Tomas.

36:01.759 --> 36:04.194
Do you remember
Itzhak Rozen?

36:08.533 --> 36:10.733
He was my grandfather.

36:10.768 --> 36:13.203
Clearly, the old guy doesn't
pose much of a threat,

36:13.238 --> 36:15.438
but Bill did say that Alana
used to stay here a lot.

36:15.473 --> 36:17.240
Right, and if she was here,

36:17.275 --> 36:18.374
she could have picked up
something heavy,

36:18.409 --> 36:19.576
hit her over the head,
killed her,

36:19.611 --> 36:20.944
and then just dumped
the body.

36:20.979 --> 36:22.679
Yeah, it was smart of Alana

36:22.714 --> 36:24.581
to take the gun back
to Leia's bungalow.

36:24.616 --> 36:26.616
Got us thinking
somebody was after her.

36:26.651 --> 36:27.884
She sent you in the wrong
direction

36:27.919 --> 36:32.422
just long enough for her
and<i> Herr</i> daddy to get away.

36:32.457 --> 36:33.957
See what I did there?

36:33.992 --> 36:35.592
Yeah, you're very clever-- why
don't you make yourself useful

36:35.627 --> 36:37.694
and start going through
Tomas' stuff,

36:37.729 --> 36:39.329
see if you can find something
that might give us an idea

36:39.364 --> 36:40.630
of where they're headed, okay?

36:40.665 --> 36:41.464
Check.

36:41.499 --> 36:43.600
It's bad enough
this guy's managed

36:43.635 --> 36:45.568
to escape justice
all these years.

36:45.603 --> 36:46.769
If he disappears
again, though...

36:46.804 --> 36:48.504
He's not gonna
disappear again.

36:48.539 --> 36:50.006
What makes you say that?

36:50.041 --> 36:52.242
'Cause it's not 1945.

36:52.277 --> 36:54.510
There's a... there's a camera
on every street corner,

36:54.545 --> 36:55.545
not to mention
everybody's pocket.

36:55.580 --> 36:56.779
Everybody's got
a cell phone.

36:56.814 --> 36:58.514
All the kids have
got smart phones.

36:58.549 --> 37:01.417
And social media,
24-hour news.

37:01.452 --> 37:02.986
There is no hiding anymore.

37:03.021 --> 37:04.587
We're gonna put the
word on the street

37:04.622 --> 37:06.623
and he won't stay missing
for long, I promise you.

37:08.526 --> 37:09.792
Thanks for all
your help, Bill.

37:09.827 --> 37:12.428
We really appreciate it.

37:12.463 --> 37:13.229
Take care
of yourself, okay?

37:13.264 --> 37:15.298
Uh, yeah, thank you,
Lieutenant.

37:15.333 --> 37:18.034
Uh... (sighs)

37:18.069 --> 37:20.036
Well, I hope you find 'em.

37:20.071 --> 37:21.905
We'll find 'em.

37:22.940 --> 37:24.908
They were my friends.

37:28.646 --> 37:30.714
I know they were.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.784
I'm sorry, Bill.

37:44.862 --> 37:46.763
It's been
a pleasure, Eric.

37:46.798 --> 37:49.499
Same here.

37:49.534 --> 37:51.868
Listen, can I be real
with you for a sec?

37:53.538 --> 37:55.638
When I first got here,
and we met,

37:55.673 --> 37:59.575
I acted all... weird.

37:59.610 --> 38:02.779
And, uh... I'm sorry.

38:02.814 --> 38:05.548
I hadn't noticed.

38:05.583 --> 38:07.917
(chuckles):
Right.

38:23.101 --> 38:24.801
Thank you.

38:24.836 --> 38:27.537
It's a beautiful place.

38:27.572 --> 38:29.105
I'd like to come back
sometime.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.708
You're welcome
anytime, brah.

39:01.139 --> 39:04.040
KAMEKONA:<i> Thanks for agreeing</i>
<i>to a sit-down.</i>

39:04.075 --> 39:06.709
Mahalo.

39:06.744 --> 39:09.979
Not easy marching around
in a circle all day, is it?

39:10.014 --> 39:12.615
I admit, my dogs are
barking a little,

39:12.650 --> 39:16.986
but we'll be back here
tomorrow, bright and early.

39:17.021 --> 39:20.390
I know you will,
but I've been thinking.

39:20.425 --> 39:23.126
Showdowns like this,
nobody wins.

39:23.161 --> 39:25.094
The thing is,
I can't give you

39:25.129 --> 39:27.130
everything you're asking for.

39:27.165 --> 39:29.599
However, what if I was
to make you part

39:29.634 --> 39:32.702
of my management team,
effective immediately?

39:32.737 --> 39:34.504
Really?

39:34.539 --> 39:35.972
You showed some real
leadership ability,

39:36.007 --> 39:37.673
Norma Rae.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.075
I know it wasn't easy

39:39.110 --> 39:40.943
getting your co-workers
to join in

39:40.978 --> 39:43.079
on your little walkout.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.647
So what do you say?

39:44.682 --> 39:48.084
What duties would this
new position entail?

39:48.119 --> 39:50.820
Same as before--
sell my shrimp.

39:50.855 --> 39:53.523
So all I get
is a title bump?

39:53.558 --> 39:55.758
No, you also get
your own truck.

39:55.793 --> 39:59.429
You'd be operation manager
for the North Shore division

39:59.464 --> 40:02.131
of Kamekona Enterprise,
Incorporated.

40:02.166 --> 40:05.134
Really? My own truck?

40:05.169 --> 40:07.203
I'm thinking about expanding.

40:07.238 --> 40:08.871
Time seems right.

40:08.906 --> 40:11.441
The North Shore
is an underserved market.

40:12.910 --> 40:15.778
What about them?

40:15.813 --> 40:17.647
You're gonna need
people to work it.

40:17.682 --> 40:19.182
Take 'em with you.

40:19.217 --> 40:21.617
Maybe give 'em
a modest raise.

40:21.652 --> 40:23.453
When I say "modest,"
I mean small.

40:25.156 --> 40:27.791
So you in or what?

40:29.727 --> 40:31.594
Mahalo.

40:33.865 --> 40:36.132
You earned it,
little cuz.
