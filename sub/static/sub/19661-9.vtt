00:01.550 --> 00:03.420
- Hurry up!
- I'm trying.

00:03.420 --> 00:05.420
- Come on!

00:07.090 --> 00:09.160
- Okay, okay, okay...
- Come on.

00:13.200 --> 00:15.030
- Did you hear that?

00:15.030 --> 00:16.129
- No.

00:17.600 --> 00:18.600
- Ah!

00:18.600 --> 00:20.440
- Jesus, Bethany!

00:20.440 --> 00:23.070
You're killing us.

00:23.070 --> 00:25.070
- Wait, I think it was...

00:25.080 --> 00:26.270
I-I don't know.

00:26.280 --> 00:27.540
- It's right. I'm sure.

00:27.540 --> 00:29.310
- Okay.

00:29.310 --> 00:30.580
- Door!

00:32.580 --> 00:34.150
- It's locked.

00:34.150 --> 00:37.150
- Start looking. Hurry!

00:37.150 --> 00:39.550
- Look...

00:40.820 --> 00:42.820
Going somewhere?

00:44.110 --> 00:45.340
- Were we at least close?

00:45.470 --> 00:47.200
- You know, you don't
have to enjoy it so much.

00:47.200 --> 00:48.600
- You got farther than
the others.

00:48.600 --> 00:51.200
- Maybe if
someone hadn't wiped out.

00:51.200 --> 00:53.360
- Come on, let's go get
the others and hit McConnell's.

00:55.210 --> 00:56.640
- Was that...
- Not part of the game.

00:56.640 --> 00:58.640
- Go.

01:01.180 --> 01:02.410
- Ooh!

01:02.420 --> 01:04.680
- Oh, my god, Kennedy.

01:05.680 --> 01:09.150
- Call 911 for Christ's sakes!

01:12.690 --> 01:14.530
- Hey.

01:14.530 --> 01:16.260
When daddy warbuck's
baby girl gets whacked,

01:16.260 --> 01:18.330
they call in the big guns, huh?

01:18.330 --> 01:20.370
- I'm happy to crawl my ass back
in the warm bed it came out of.

01:20.370 --> 01:22.170
- I'd take that.
What do we know?

01:22.170 --> 01:24.440
- Kids all go to
central Chicago university.

01:24.440 --> 01:25.700
- What are they doing
all the way out here?

01:25.710 --> 01:27.510
- Trespassing.

01:27.510 --> 01:30.340
They threw themselves
a makeshift escape room.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.510
Theme was a prison break.

01:31.510 --> 01:34.510
That one is the "gamemaster."

01:34.510 --> 01:37.520
- I guess a case of beer and
a bulls game is passÃ© now.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.920
- Yeah... oh.
Hold up, hold up.

01:41.290 --> 01:43.560
Meet Kennedy Malloy.

01:43.560 --> 01:47.190
Twenty-one.
Senior at ccu.

01:47.190 --> 01:50.300
A single
gunshot wound to the chest.

01:55.270 --> 01:56.670
- What about the weapon?

01:56.670 --> 01:58.670
- It's Mia
along with one of the kiddies.

01:58.670 --> 02:00.270
- And the kiddie's name?

02:00.270 --> 02:01.540
- Are you sitting?

02:01.540 --> 02:03.980
Abigail Chapman.

02:03.980 --> 02:06.440
- I guess killing her squeeze
while studying abroad in Spain

02:06.450 --> 02:09.550
wasn't good enough.
- Madre de dios...

02:19.360 --> 02:21.860
- Kennedy was
a total sweetheart.

02:21.860 --> 02:24.500
I can't believe she's gone.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.000
- What about Abigail?

02:26.000 --> 02:28.000
- I saw her
before the game started.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.600
- You heard the gunshot?

02:29.600 --> 02:32.700
- Uh, I recorded it
on my snap story.

02:35.980 --> 02:38.980
<i>Okay, bitches.
I'm kicking butt this time.</i>

02:40.880 --> 02:43.620
- You posted this video
at 11:16 P.M.

02:43.620 --> 02:46.020
- A gunshot went off and
you didn't think that was weird?

02:46.020 --> 02:48.750
- I figured
it was a part of the game.

02:48.760 --> 02:49.920
- This is Chicago.

02:49.920 --> 02:53.690
When's a gunshot not going off?

02:53.690 --> 02:55.630
- Stacy and I
didn't hear the shot.

02:55.630 --> 02:57.330
We were on the opposite side
of the building.

02:57.330 --> 02:59.530
- Did Kennedy ever mention
any issues with Abigail?

02:59.530 --> 03:01.670
- I didn't really know Kennedy.

03:01.670 --> 03:03.570
I'm a freshman.
She's a senior.

03:03.570 --> 03:05.000
- Abigail seemed cool.

03:05.010 --> 03:06.840
I never believed
she killed that Spanish guy.

03:06.840 --> 03:09.670
- A world famous ex-con
and a prison break.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.580
Who wouldn't pay for that?

03:11.580 --> 03:13.850
- Okay, you supplied
the space, the clues, the rope.

03:13.850 --> 03:15.680
What about the gun?
You supply that, too?

03:15.680 --> 03:17.320
- To heighten the experience?

03:17.320 --> 03:19.020
- I've thrown
ten escape rooms before.

03:19.020 --> 03:20.950
No one has ever been hurt.

03:20.950 --> 03:23.290
- So what the hell is
an escape room?

03:23.290 --> 03:25.290
- It's an interactive game.

03:25.290 --> 03:28.560
Players try to get out of
real life or extreme situations

03:28.560 --> 03:30.960
using physical and
mental dexterity.

03:30.960 --> 03:32.730
- This one was a prison break.

03:32.730 --> 03:34.000
- That's ironic.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.570
- Each kid had to find
his partner,

03:35.570 --> 03:36.900
who was tied up somewhere,

03:36.900 --> 03:38.300
then they try
to escape together.

03:38.310 --> 03:39.840
- So who was Kennedy's partner?

03:39.840 --> 03:41.570
- Abigail.

03:41.570 --> 03:43.570
Kennedy Malloy's father

03:43.580 --> 03:47.080
is in Japan on business.

03:47.080 --> 03:49.010
The mayor would
greatly appreciate it

03:49.020 --> 03:51.020
if we had the shooter
behind bars

03:51.020 --> 03:53.820
before her father lands
at O'Hare.

03:53.820 --> 03:55.590
- My people are on it.

03:55.590 --> 03:57.990
- What's there to be on?
We know who did it.

03:57.990 --> 04:00.330
Abigail Chapman's
been back from Spain...

04:00.330 --> 04:02.330
What, three months now?

04:02.330 --> 04:04.900
Do you have any idea
what kind of press

04:04.900 --> 04:06.900
the "vicious ViXen"
will attract?

04:06.900 --> 04:08.670
- If anyone's interested,

04:08.670 --> 04:10.940
Abigail was acquitted
of her boyfriend's murder.

04:10.940 --> 04:13.770
There wasn't a single drop
of her DNA at the crime scene.

04:13.770 --> 04:15.970
The prosecutor kept her
locked up for three years

04:15.980 --> 04:18.779
before starting her trial.

04:18.779 --> 04:21.050
I was kind of obsessed
with the case.

04:21.050 --> 04:24.050
My point is maybe
it's too early to convict her.

04:24.050 --> 04:26.850
- I wouldn't rely on
the TV movie.

04:26.850 --> 04:30.860
- I read two books,
and the trial transcripts.

04:30.860 --> 04:33.990
The bottom line:
If Abigail wasn't gorgeous,

04:33.990 --> 04:36.130
this case would have never
gotten that much publicity.

04:36.130 --> 04:38.030
- And if Kennedy's father
didn't contribute to

04:38.030 --> 04:40.670
the mayor's campaign,
cpd would be handling this.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.400
- Justice.
It's a wonderful thing.

04:44.400 --> 04:46.670
Find the girl.

04:48.970 --> 04:51.440
- We need to talk to you
about Abigail, Mrs. Chapman.

04:51.440 --> 04:53.140
- Why would I help you?

04:53.150 --> 04:54.880
- Because one of
Abigail's classmates

04:54.880 --> 04:56.780
was found dead in a warehouse.

04:56.780 --> 04:59.050
- You're going to blame her
for everything?

04:59.050 --> 05:01.050
- The other kids
have cooperated...

05:01.050 --> 05:03.050
Your daughter is
the only one who ran.

05:03.060 --> 05:04.890
- Abigail could be hurt.

05:04.890 --> 05:08.430
- There's nothing at the scene
to suggest that.

05:08.430 --> 05:10.130
- The hardest thing...

05:10.130 --> 05:12.630
Harder than knowing
your baby's in a prison

05:12.630 --> 05:14.900
thousands of miles away...

05:14.900 --> 05:19.670
Is thinking that
maybe you raised a murderer.

05:19.670 --> 05:20.940
- If we could talk to her...

05:20.940 --> 05:22.710
- I have no idea where she is!

05:22.710 --> 05:24.980
- Can we take a look
at her room?

05:26.880 --> 05:29.480
- How many bedrooms
you got in this place?

05:29.480 --> 05:31.920
- Abigail wanted
to live in the dorm.

05:31.920 --> 05:34.120
We compromised on the basement.

05:34.120 --> 05:35.890
- You didn't trust her?

05:35.890 --> 05:38.160
- I just got her back.

05:38.160 --> 05:39.920
- Hm.

05:39.930 --> 05:41.790
Is your washer broke?

05:41.800 --> 05:43.800
- It's how
Abigail washed her clothes

05:43.800 --> 05:46.060
for the last three years.

05:46.070 --> 05:49.070
She's had trouble acclimating.

05:49.070 --> 05:51.700
- Do you have any guns
in the house, Ms. Chapman?

05:51.700 --> 05:53.810
- God, no.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.750
- Abigail's got an admirer.

06:05.780 --> 06:08.190
Who's Todd?

06:08.190 --> 06:10.490
- I have no idea.

06:12.790 --> 06:15.090
- Abigail at the park.
Abigail at the bookstore.

06:15.090 --> 06:16.830
- When she got back
to the states,

06:16.830 --> 06:18.160
the paparazzi
wouldn't leave her alone.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.160
- She should've rented
a cabin in Montana.

06:20.170 --> 06:22.170
- She was acquitted.
- Right.

06:22.170 --> 06:24.800
Let me ask you this: Would you
let her babysit your kids?

06:24.800 --> 06:27.740
That's what I thought.

06:27.740 --> 06:30.910
- There she is at java Joe's.

06:30.910 --> 06:32.010
Ah!

06:32.010 --> 06:34.110
I think I found our Picasso.

06:36.150 --> 06:38.520
That looks like
pastel chalk to me.

06:38.520 --> 06:41.520
- Do a reverse image search.
- Okay.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.560
Todd Mitchell.
He's 18.

06:45.560 --> 06:47.790
Goes to ccu.

06:52.830 --> 06:54.200
- That looks like the store.

06:54.200 --> 06:55.930
- Todd Mitchell?

06:55.940 --> 06:57.270
Investigators Dawson and nagel.

06:57.270 --> 06:59.140
We're from
the state's attorney's office.

06:59.140 --> 07:00.770
- What'd I do?
- Your roommate told us

07:00.770 --> 07:02.110
you were here.

07:02.110 --> 07:03.510
- We're looking for
Abigail Chapman.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.110
We heard you guys were tight.

07:05.110 --> 07:07.040
- I haven't seen her. Sorry.
- Whoa, whoa.

07:07.050 --> 07:08.510
You in a hurry?

07:08.520 --> 07:10.080
- My next class.
- That's not

07:10.080 --> 07:11.850
what your roommate says.

07:11.850 --> 07:14.250
- I meant work.

07:14.250 --> 07:15.750
- Okay.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.860
Call me if she contacts you.

07:21.560 --> 07:22.930
- Oh, jeez, sorry.

07:22.930 --> 07:25.930
Let me help you.
- I got it.

07:25.930 --> 07:28.030
Thanks.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.540
- Follow him?

07:32.540 --> 07:34.640
- I don't think
those tampons are for mom.

07:37.010 --> 07:38.580
- You think she's guilty?

07:38.580 --> 07:40.110
- Which murder
are we talking about?

07:40.110 --> 07:42.310
- He's picking up the pace.

07:42.320 --> 07:44.050
She was 18 when
she went to Madrid.

07:44.050 --> 07:45.850
She didn't speak the language.
For all we know,

07:45.850 --> 07:47.320
she's a sweet kid.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.320
- She's hot so she's innocent.

07:49.320 --> 07:51.620
- Oh, come on, I didn't say
I want to marry the girl.

08:12.310 --> 08:14.210
- Who the hell is that?

08:14.210 --> 08:16.280
- Gun!

08:27.330 --> 08:28.960
<i>- Don't make me hurt you, kid.</i>

08:28.960 --> 08:30.960
<i>- Oh, my god! Oh, my god!</i>

08:30.960 --> 08:32.860
<i>- She didn't do anything wrong!</i>

08:32.870 --> 08:34.230
<i>- I'm warning you.
- I knew this wasn't safe.</i>

08:34.230 --> 08:35.630
<i>- What do you want?</i>

08:35.640 --> 08:37.230
- It's her I want, man.

08:37.240 --> 08:39.070
Not you.
- Just leave us alone.

08:39.070 --> 08:40.100
Please!

08:40.110 --> 08:41.270
- Out of my way, bro-meo.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.640
- Ah!

08:42.640 --> 08:43.940
- No, please, please, please!

08:43.940 --> 08:45.110
No, no!

08:45.110 --> 08:46.380
- Let go of the girl!

08:46.380 --> 08:48.150
- Ah, come on, man!

08:48.150 --> 08:49.210
- Turn around!

08:49.220 --> 08:50.880
- I found her first.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.120
We can work a deal.
Who sent you?

08:53.120 --> 08:55.050
- State's attorney's office.

08:55.050 --> 08:56.950
Your turn.
- Spain.

08:56.960 --> 08:59.360
I'm a bounty hunter.

08:59.360 --> 09:01.990
Let me have her and
I'll cut you in on my action.

09:02.000 --> 09:03.860
How's ten percent?
- That's it?

09:03.860 --> 09:06.860
Once a pig, always...

09:06.870 --> 09:08.200
All right, man! Shove off, man!

09:08.200 --> 09:09.270
- Todd. Scram.

09:09.270 --> 09:10.670
- I've got ID!

09:10.670 --> 09:12.400
- Abigail,
you're coming with us.

09:12.410 --> 09:14.270
- Following her since Madrid.
- Let me see your ID!

09:14.270 --> 09:15.970
- I've got ID in my pocket.
- Get up!

09:20.680 --> 09:23.250
- Do you go to church?

09:23.250 --> 09:25.250
I used to go...

09:25.250 --> 09:28.150
Prison is the opposite.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.420
Church...

09:29.420 --> 09:32.420
It lifts your mind upwards...

09:32.430 --> 09:35.430
To a place...
I don't know...

09:35.430 --> 09:39.360
Beyond the reaches of your soul.

09:39.370 --> 09:42.370
But prison...

09:42.370 --> 09:44.140
It pushes you down.

09:44.140 --> 09:46.040
- Is that why you ran away?

09:46.040 --> 09:48.910
You don't want to go back?
- Maybe I'm just psycho!

09:48.910 --> 09:50.440
That's what
they said about me in Spain

09:50.440 --> 09:52.440
so maybe they were right.

09:52.450 --> 09:55.750
- Sit down.

10:00.720 --> 10:03.420
- Maybe I...

10:03.420 --> 10:05.760
I just wanted to be
one of the guys.

10:05.760 --> 10:07.690
Okay, maybe I just...

10:07.690 --> 10:10.700
I wanted to have friends.

10:20.170 --> 10:23.770
- Tell us about Kennedy Malloy.

10:23.780 --> 10:25.340
- I need to use the bathroom.

10:25.340 --> 10:26.740
- Answer the question.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.180
- Christ, I must have shot her!

10:29.180 --> 10:31.780
I must be a killer, right?

10:31.780 --> 10:33.150
- This is painful.

10:33.150 --> 10:34.420
- She's nearly there.

10:34.420 --> 10:36.250
- I killed Kennedy.

10:36.260 --> 10:38.160
That's what you want me
to say, right?

10:38.160 --> 10:39.420
- Help us understand what...

10:42.430 --> 10:45.430
Nagel!

10:45.430 --> 10:47.100
- Hey, hey, hey, hey! Come here!

10:47.100 --> 10:48.430
Come here.
- Ugh!

10:48.430 --> 10:50.270
- Settle down. Hey! Come here.

10:50.270 --> 10:51.800
Settle down.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.240
- We need a medic.
- No, I'm fine.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.110
- Not for you.

10:55.110 --> 10:56.510
- What?
She caught me by surprise.

10:56.510 --> 10:58.440
I'm not gonna hit a girl.
- Ugh!

11:02.520 --> 11:05.420
- Abigail was on two different
types of anti-depressants.

11:05.420 --> 11:06.880
Add a tab of ecstasy.

11:06.890 --> 11:08.450
- Thank god
stupid isn't a defense.

11:08.450 --> 11:10.220
- Peter!

11:10.220 --> 11:12.360
You forgot your phone.
- Thanks.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.890
- It was on my desk.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.890
U.S. attorney frank Harrison

11:15.900 --> 11:17.830
called about Abigail Chapman.

11:17.830 --> 11:20.200
- Great.
Who violated the girl's rights?

11:20.200 --> 11:21.930
- Spain,
or they're about to anyway.

11:21.930 --> 11:23.830
They want her back
for a retrial.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.440
- Hard to believe
a country that invented paella

11:25.440 --> 11:27.540
hasn't thought about
double jeopardy.

11:29.010 --> 11:31.780
Abigail Chapman is
an American citizen, your honor.

11:31.780 --> 11:33.780
Pursuant to article iv of
the extradition treaty

11:33.780 --> 11:35.510
between Spain and the U.S.,

11:35.520 --> 11:38.350
neither nation is required to
turn over its own nationals.

11:38.350 --> 11:40.350
- I have an affidavit from
the state department

11:40.350 --> 11:43.250
waiving article iv protection
for Ms. Chapman.

11:43.260 --> 11:45.390
Your honor,
she murdered a Spanish national.

11:45.390 --> 11:47.830
- So tell me, what's the point
of article iv then?

11:47.830 --> 11:49.960
She was tried in Spain
and acquitted, your honor.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.900
- The Spanish prosecutor
has presented new evidence,

11:51.900 --> 11:53.900
and filed for a retrial.

11:53.900 --> 11:55.900
- It shocks the conscious that
the U.S. attorney's office

11:55.900 --> 11:58.340
is willing to send
a citizen back to a system

11:58.340 --> 12:01.010
that ignores one of the rights
that we hold so fundamental.

12:01.010 --> 12:03.310
- Unfortunately,
our constitution doesn't buy her

12:03.310 --> 12:05.240
a cup of coffee in Madrid.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.580
- Can I assume your motive

12:06.580 --> 12:08.980
isn't strictly humanitarian,
Mr. stone?

12:08.980 --> 12:10.550
- Ms. Chapman is
a person of interest

12:10.550 --> 12:11.980
in the murder of a ccu student.

12:11.980 --> 12:13.920
- Where is she now?

12:13.920 --> 12:16.020
- She's currently detained at
a state psychiatric facility.

12:16.020 --> 12:17.560
It would be a violation
of basic human...

12:17.560 --> 12:19.090
- like we used to say as kids,

12:19.090 --> 12:21.930
"possession is nine tenths
of the law."

12:21.930 --> 12:25.560
You have 48 hours, Mr. stone,
to formally charge Ms. Chapman.

12:25.570 --> 12:28.030
If at that time,
charges have not been filed,

12:28.030 --> 12:30.030
I'll be forced to hand
her extradition over

12:30.040 --> 12:32.140
to the U.S. magistrate.

12:35.070 --> 12:36.540
- Peter.

12:36.540 --> 12:38.280
Looks like we're famous
by association.

12:43.380 --> 12:44.850
- That's sick.

12:44.850 --> 12:46.950
- Celeb central.

12:50.520 --> 12:53.120
- This picture was taken
in the escape room.

12:53.130 --> 12:54.960
Find out who sold it
to celeb central,

12:54.960 --> 12:56.130
and see if there are any more.

12:56.130 --> 12:58.360
- Yeah.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.530
- Okay, guys.

13:01.530 --> 13:03.430
I got a double sawbuck

13:03.440 --> 13:06.440
for anyone who can tell me
who shot this photo.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.370
- Nobody here, that's for sure.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.110
That cover was mine.

13:10.110 --> 13:12.880
That punk ass kid comes in
like he's Annie leibovitz

13:12.880 --> 13:14.880
and I end up on page 15.

13:14.880 --> 13:16.510
Now I'm out here with
these knuckleheads,

13:16.520 --> 13:18.520
freezing my tush off,
trying to get pictures of

13:18.520 --> 13:20.990
Selena swapping spit
with the weeknd.

13:20.990 --> 13:23.120
- You wouldn't happen to have
a name for that punk ass kid?

13:23.120 --> 13:24.560
- Nah, sorry.
- Any of these faces

13:24.560 --> 13:26.660
ring a bell?

13:28.430 --> 13:30.430
- Ah! Ah.

13:30.430 --> 13:32.400
I get that double sawsky, right?

13:38.570 --> 13:40.470
- You're surprised
the school booted you?

13:40.470 --> 13:42.070
A student was murdered
at your escape room.

13:42.070 --> 13:43.640
- Yeah, and last week,

13:43.640 --> 13:44.980
a sophomore choked on
her own vomit

13:44.980 --> 13:46.480
at the sigma phi party.

13:46.480 --> 13:48.080
Guess who still
gets to attend ccu?

13:48.080 --> 13:50.480
- How much did celeb central
pay you for this?

13:50.480 --> 13:52.120
- What are you, the IRS?

13:52.120 --> 13:54.150
- We just want to know
if you have any more.

14:02.160 --> 14:04.430
They're all time-stamped.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.170
Abigail's still tied up
at 11:17.

14:08.170 --> 14:10.000
That girl with the snapchat.

14:10.000 --> 14:12.140
The gunshot when off at 11:16.

14:12.140 --> 14:14.240
- So Abigail couldn't
have shot Kennedy.

14:17.610 --> 14:19.380
- I'm sorry about before.

14:19.380 --> 14:22.180
I didn't know
what I was doing or saying.

14:22.180 --> 14:24.550
- You're going to arrest her?

14:24.550 --> 14:28.690
- We're pretty sure that
Abigail didn't kill Kennedy.

14:28.690 --> 14:30.690
Her friends, not so much.

14:30.690 --> 14:33.520
What can you tell us
about the others?

14:33.530 --> 14:36.130
- Not much, um...

14:36.130 --> 14:38.030
Margo likes to party.

14:38.030 --> 14:40.030
She hangs out with Stacy.

14:40.030 --> 14:43.730
- What about
Eric, Bethany, or Cindy?

14:43.740 --> 14:45.140
- Bethany's sweet.

14:45.140 --> 14:47.100
She's in
my American novel class.

14:47.110 --> 14:49.540
She wants to be a writer, too.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.540
She let me read
one of her stories.

14:51.540 --> 14:53.210
I told you about it.

14:53.210 --> 14:56.110
It's a wealthy girl
who is an animal activist,

14:56.120 --> 14:58.550
but runs around town
in a fur coat

14:58.550 --> 15:00.080
that her father bought her.

15:01.220 --> 15:03.650
We kind of bonded.

15:03.660 --> 15:06.560
Bethany doesn't have
a dad either.

15:06.560 --> 15:10.560
- Her dad left
before Abby's trial began.

15:10.560 --> 15:14.160
He thought she was guilty.

15:14.170 --> 15:17.700
- I still don't get why you ran.

15:17.700 --> 15:19.700
- The clanging.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.710
- Clanging?

15:22.710 --> 15:25.480
- At night,
there was this guard...

15:25.480 --> 15:27.480
Victor.

15:27.480 --> 15:31.480
I was in my cell and he'd drag

15:31.480 --> 15:36.720
this metal chain
across the floor...

15:36.720 --> 15:38.790
I'm sorry.

15:42.030 --> 15:44.030
- Thank you.

15:44.030 --> 15:46.030
- Will they send her
back to Spain now?

15:46.030 --> 15:49.130
- We'll do what we can
to keep her here, Mrs. Chapman.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.680
- If Abigail was tied up
in there,

15:59.680 --> 16:01.510
the clanging had to come
from over here somewhere.

16:01.510 --> 16:03.110
- Or it might
just be in her head.

16:03.120 --> 16:04.620
- Yeah, maybe.

16:04.620 --> 16:06.180
- You shouldn't
have gotten her hopes up

16:06.190 --> 16:08.620
about stopping the feds
from extraditing her.

16:08.620 --> 16:10.090
- Look at that.

16:10.090 --> 16:11.760
Like in the old movies.

16:11.760 --> 16:12.820
- Huh.

16:12.830 --> 16:15.130
I'll bet that clangs.

16:22.200 --> 16:24.300
- Maybe it wasn't in her head.

16:35.310 --> 16:36.750
- A walther...

16:36.750 --> 16:38.650
That's one fancy murder weapon.

16:38.650 --> 16:40.320
- Abigail just became
a material witness

16:40.320 --> 16:41.750
in a murder case.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.850
She ain't going anywhere.

16:45.690 --> 16:47.690
- Ballistics says
the gun nagel and Dawson found

16:47.690 --> 16:49.590
is, in fact, the murder weapon.

16:49.600 --> 16:50.860
- Tell me
there are prints on it.

16:50.860 --> 16:52.530
- Two sets.
One is Kennedy's.

16:52.530 --> 16:55.230
The other isn't in
any data bank...

16:55.230 --> 16:57.670
And there's something else...

16:57.670 --> 17:00.170
The gun was traced back
to Kennedy Malloy.

17:00.170 --> 17:03.170
- She was killed by her own gun?

17:03.180 --> 17:05.609
Yeah.

17:12.319 --> 17:15.450
- I bought her the gun.

17:15.450 --> 17:17.250
It was a birthday present.

17:17.260 --> 17:18.589
She was 21.

17:18.589 --> 17:20.420
- Wow.

17:20.430 --> 17:22.190
- Kennedy...

17:22.190 --> 17:24.190
Was single.
She lived alone.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.859
I had...

17:25.869 --> 17:27.460
Relocated to Kobe earlier
this year to set up

17:27.470 --> 17:30.470
our offices there.

17:30.470 --> 17:33.600
I worried about her.

17:33.610 --> 17:37.510
I wanted her to have a gun
so she could protect herself.

17:37.510 --> 17:39.510
- From anyone in particular?

17:39.510 --> 17:43.150
- There were over 4,000 people
shot in Chicago last year.

17:43.150 --> 17:47.150
But no, she never
said anything. Um...

17:47.150 --> 17:48.890
She did have a run-in
with some students.

17:48.890 --> 17:50.420
They...

17:50.420 --> 17:52.260
Filed disciplinary charges
against her.

17:52.260 --> 17:53.590
They were ultimately dropped.

17:53.590 --> 17:55.490
- What were the charges about?

17:55.490 --> 17:58.230
- She was part of a group called
the Madison club.

17:58.230 --> 17:59.630
Uh...

17:59.630 --> 18:01.930
Kids getting together,
talking politics.

18:01.930 --> 18:03.930
They...

18:03.940 --> 18:07.470
They passed out
pocket constitutions on campus,

18:07.470 --> 18:09.940
and I guess...

18:09.940 --> 18:12.280
Some people...

18:12.280 --> 18:14.180
Were offended...

18:14.180 --> 18:15.650
And why not?

18:15.650 --> 18:19.650
It was written by
dead, white slave-owners.

18:19.650 --> 18:21.720
- Thank you for coming in,
Mr. Malloy.

18:23.620 --> 18:26.390
- Mr. stone, uh...

18:26.390 --> 18:27.960
13 hours on a plane.

18:27.960 --> 18:31.600
A father's mind can go
to some dark places.

18:31.600 --> 18:34.230
Kennedy didn't...
- Suicide?

18:34.230 --> 18:35.430
No.

18:35.430 --> 18:38.200
Someone tried to hide the gun.

18:39.470 --> 18:41.570
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

18:50.280 --> 18:51.980
- She might as well
have killed herself.

18:51.980 --> 18:53.680
- You just heard her father.

18:53.690 --> 18:55.550
The gun was for her protection.

18:55.550 --> 18:57.250
She didn't use it to rob a bank.

18:57.260 --> 18:59.260
She did everything legally.

18:59.260 --> 19:00.990
- Did her a lot of good.

19:00.990 --> 19:02.730
- Talk to her friends
at the Madison club.

19:08.530 --> 19:10.430
- This is the only country
on the planet

19:10.440 --> 19:12.440
that teaches its kids
what a bad country it is.

19:12.440 --> 19:14.270
Declaration of independence.

19:14.270 --> 19:15.470
Bill of rights.

19:15.470 --> 19:17.470
What a nightmare.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.480
Did...

19:19.480 --> 19:21.810
Did Kennedy die because
we handed out the constitution?

19:21.810 --> 19:24.310
- That's what
I'm trying to figure out.

19:24.320 --> 19:25.720
- If you ask me,
professor hall was behind

19:25.720 --> 19:27.720
that whole grievance thing.

19:27.720 --> 19:29.990
He teaches English,
for god's sakes.

19:29.990 --> 19:32.590
Kennedy said he spent more time
ranting about lefty politics

19:32.590 --> 19:35.490
than he did talking about
faulkner or whoever.

19:35.490 --> 19:37.330
- Did she ever
complain about it?

19:37.330 --> 19:38.760
- And who would listen?

19:38.760 --> 19:41.330
She recorded
one of his lectures.

19:41.330 --> 19:42.730
We were gonna go to
the newspapers with it.

19:42.740 --> 19:45.500
Get his ass canned
by the trustees.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.340
- What happened?

19:47.340 --> 19:49.040
- Hall saw her phone
on her desk....

19:49.040 --> 19:52.040
Realized what she was doing,
and went ballistic.

19:52.040 --> 19:55.650
Bastard actually confiscated
her iPhone 7.

19:55.650 --> 19:58.750
The next time,
Kennedy was smarter.

20:00.820 --> 20:03.650
Do you want to hear it?

20:03.660 --> 20:06.660
- Yeah.

20:06.660 --> 20:09.660
<i>- Gun owners
are the enemy, people.</i>

20:09.660 --> 20:12.300
<i>Just once, I'd like
one of these maniacs</i>

20:12.300 --> 20:14.300
<i>to shoot up an nra office.</i>

20:14.300 --> 20:16.400
<i>Things would change in a hurry.</i>

20:17.500 --> 20:18.840
- This guy teaches
American literature?

20:18.840 --> 20:20.670
- There's more.

20:20.670 --> 20:22.410
They were petitioning for
the right to carry

20:22.410 --> 20:24.470
concealed firearms on campus.

20:24.480 --> 20:26.740
They were expecting trouble
so they had someone filming it.

20:26.750 --> 20:28.050
<i>- Kennedy, come here now.</i>

20:28.050 --> 20:31.420
- That is professor hall.

20:31.420 --> 20:32.820
<i>- You can't be doing this
on campus.</i>

20:32.820 --> 20:34.650
<i>- I have
a first amendment right.</i>

20:34.650 --> 20:35.790
- There were at least
seven kids petitioning.

20:35.790 --> 20:38.090
Why did hall single out Kennedy?

20:38.090 --> 20:39.660
- Have Dawson and nagel
talk to him.

20:39.660 --> 20:41.460
- I can do it.

20:41.460 --> 20:42.790
- No, you'll be too busy
writing a motion to delay

20:42.800 --> 20:44.860
Abigail Chapman's extradition.

20:49.870 --> 20:51.670
Torrent downloaded from RARBG.

20:51.670 --> 20:53.670
- It's horrific
what happened to Kennedy.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.410
I can't say that
I'm surprised though.

20:55.410 --> 20:57.110
- Why's that?
- On average,

20:57.110 --> 20:59.380
12,000 Americans are killed
by guns every year.

20:59.380 --> 21:01.380
- Tell me about it.

21:01.380 --> 21:02.650
- Binge-drinking deaths.

21:02.650 --> 21:04.410
Suicides. Car accidents.

21:04.420 --> 21:06.380
Opiate overdoses.
I mean..

21:06.390 --> 21:08.390
Why add firearms into the mix?

21:08.390 --> 21:08.990
- Is that what
you said just before

21:08.990 --> 21:12.360
you confiscated Kennedy's phone?

21:18.530 --> 21:20.660
- First of all,
it's school policy.

21:20.670 --> 21:22.670
No recording lectures.

21:22.670 --> 21:24.130
And second, if you guys think

21:24.140 --> 21:25.870
I had something to do with
Kennedy's death,

21:25.870 --> 21:27.700
then you don't know
a thing about me.

21:27.710 --> 21:29.570
- We do know that you had
a heated discussion

21:29.580 --> 21:31.580
with Kennedy
outside the student union.

21:31.580 --> 21:32.780
What was that about?

21:32.780 --> 21:33.940
- I was simply
voicing my objection

21:33.950 --> 21:35.610
to conceal and carry.

21:35.610 --> 21:36.950
- Why not voice it to
the whole group?

21:36.950 --> 21:39.580
- 'Cause Kennedy
was the only one I knew.

21:39.590 --> 21:41.120
Let's be honest.

21:41.120 --> 21:43.120
We wouldn't even be having
this conversation

21:43.120 --> 21:46.420
if Kennedy hadn't brought
her gun to that escape room.

21:49.430 --> 21:52.530
- Thank you for your time,
professor hall.

21:54.700 --> 21:56.470
- That's one pompous prick.

21:56.470 --> 21:57.900
- We didn't release
a statement saying

21:57.900 --> 21:59.600
that Kennedy was killed
by her own gun.

21:59.610 --> 22:00.970
So how did hall know?

22:00.970 --> 22:02.910
- Someone who was in
the escape room told him.

22:02.910 --> 22:04.740
- Let's circle back
through the escapees.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.840
See who knows
the good professor.

22:07.950 --> 22:09.850
- Work study jobs tend to be

22:09.850 --> 22:13.480
the least glamorous jobs
on campus, but I...

22:13.490 --> 22:15.750
Could be shoveling manure
back in Fontana...

22:15.750 --> 22:18.890
Kansas.
- Shh!

22:18.890 --> 22:20.720
- Mom sends what she can.

22:20.730 --> 22:21.930
She's alone.

22:21.930 --> 22:24.630
Dad died when I was one. Cancer.

22:24.630 --> 22:25.660
- Sorry.

22:25.660 --> 22:26.930
- You're in two of

22:26.930 --> 22:28.730
professor hall's classes
this semester.

22:28.730 --> 22:30.630
- Contemporary literature,
and the American novel.

22:30.640 --> 22:32.470
Why?

22:32.470 --> 22:34.000
- We heard that hall and Kennedy
had an altercation.

22:34.010 --> 22:35.910
- Okay.

22:35.910 --> 22:37.910
- It might have something
to do with her murder.

22:37.910 --> 22:40.910
- Professor hall
wasn't even there.

22:40.910 --> 22:42.510
Listen, I, uh...

22:42.510 --> 22:44.010
Really gotta finish up
with these so...

22:44.020 --> 22:45.750
- Sure. Just one more thing.

22:45.750 --> 22:48.750
If you could take a look
at these and tell me

22:48.750 --> 22:51.860
if anything jogs your memory?

22:57.900 --> 22:59.900
- Nothing. Sorry.

22:59.900 --> 23:02.000
- Thanks anyway.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.740
- At least we got her prints.

23:10.910 --> 23:12.680
- We got a winner.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.680
- Bethany pierson
from the escape room.

23:14.680 --> 23:17.950
She belongs to the second set
of prints on the murder weapon.

23:17.950 --> 23:21.020
- Arrest her.

23:24.660 --> 23:26.660
- Again?
- Bethany pierson?

23:26.660 --> 23:28.560
Stand up.

23:28.560 --> 23:31.560
You are under arrest for
the murder of Kennedy Malloy.

23:31.560 --> 23:34.630
- What?
- Shh.

23:44.910 --> 23:47.580
- I found traces of blood.
Micro-spatter, to be precise,

23:47.580 --> 23:49.150
on the defendant's jeans.

23:49.150 --> 23:51.580
It was the victim,
Kennedy Malloy's blood.

23:51.580 --> 23:53.580
- I show you what has already
been admitted into evidence

23:53.590 --> 23:55.590
as people's 17.

23:55.590 --> 23:57.020
Have you see it before?

23:57.020 --> 23:58.890
- I dusted it for fingerprints.

23:58.890 --> 24:00.020
- And what did you find?

24:00.030 --> 24:01.560
- There were two sets of prints.

24:01.560 --> 24:03.190
One belonged to the victim,

24:03.200 --> 24:05.100
and the other matched those
of the defendant.

24:05.100 --> 24:08.000
- Could you determine how far
the gun was from the victim

24:08.000 --> 24:10.130
when she was killed?
- Yes.

24:10.140 --> 24:12.040
From the burn pattern on
the victim's blouse,

24:12.040 --> 24:15.110
the muzzle was between
two and three inches away.

24:17.210 --> 24:19.840
- Thank you.

24:19.850 --> 24:22.310
- Now, can I assume
you also studied

24:22.310 --> 24:25.020
the angle at which
the bullet entered the victim?

24:25.020 --> 24:27.920
- It entered the victim's chest
at 10 degrees.

24:27.920 --> 24:31.790
- So ten degrees
would be like this?

24:31.790 --> 24:33.590
- Give or take.

24:33.590 --> 24:36.590
- But if I wanted to shoot you,
wouldn't it be more like this?

24:36.600 --> 24:38.060
- That's hard to say.

24:38.060 --> 24:39.860
- You're right. It is.

24:39.870 --> 24:41.870
Let's talk for a minute
about those fingerprints.

24:41.870 --> 24:44.300
The location of my client's,
to be precise.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.970
- There were multiple prints
on the grip and the slide.

24:46.970 --> 24:48.870
A partial on the safety.

24:48.870 --> 24:52.040
- And were Ms. pierson's prints
the only ones on the slot?

24:52.040 --> 24:54.310
- No. Ms. Malloy's
print was there, too.

24:54.310 --> 24:56.610
- Go ahead. Show us.

25:00.320 --> 25:02.320
Kind of like there was
a struggle for the gun

25:02.320 --> 25:04.050
when it went off.

25:04.060 --> 25:07.060
Kind of like self-defense...

25:07.060 --> 25:08.660
Thank you.

25:08.660 --> 25:11.900
No more questions, your honor.

25:14.070 --> 25:17.070
- Why did you buy your daughter
a gun, Mr. Malloy?

25:17.070 --> 25:19.970
- It was because of
my wife, Evelyn.

25:19.970 --> 25:22.040
- Kennedy's mom?
- That's right.

25:23.940 --> 25:27.940
Kennedy was two...

25:27.950 --> 25:32.080
She was still asleep upstairs.

25:32.080 --> 25:33.350
Evie was in the kitchen.

25:33.350 --> 25:35.390
She had the dishwasher running.

25:35.390 --> 25:38.020
I guess I forgot...

25:38.020 --> 25:41.120
To lock the door
on my way out that morning.

25:43.660 --> 25:48.230
That scumbag came in...

25:48.230 --> 25:50.630
He raped her.

25:50.640 --> 25:53.740
And he slit her throat.

25:57.680 --> 26:01.110
After the funeral,
I bought a gun.

26:01.110 --> 26:03.050
And as soon as Kennedy
was big enough to hold it,

26:03.050 --> 26:04.880
I took her to the range.

26:04.880 --> 26:08.990
I wanted her to know how
to protect herself.

26:10.690 --> 26:13.960
- Thank you.

26:16.130 --> 26:19.030
- I'm sorry for your loss,
Mr. Malloy.

26:19.030 --> 26:21.230
I only have a few questions.

26:21.230 --> 26:25.700
What did you buy Kennedy
for her 19th birthday?

26:25.700 --> 26:27.700
- A birkin bag, I think it was.

26:27.710 --> 26:29.070
- Wow!

26:29.070 --> 26:31.980
That costs what? Ten grand?

26:31.980 --> 26:35.110
And for her 20th birthday?

26:35.110 --> 26:36.380
- Diamond earrings.

26:36.380 --> 26:38.050
- 14 carat white gold.

26:38.050 --> 26:40.750
Roughly $18,000,
isn't that correct?

26:40.750 --> 26:42.320
- It's a milestone birthday.

26:42.320 --> 26:44.290
- And for her 21st birthday,

26:44.290 --> 26:48.190
you bought her
a walther ppk 380 acp.

26:48.190 --> 26:49.930
- That was for her protection.

26:49.930 --> 26:52.460
- From the less fortunate
girls on campus?

26:52.460 --> 26:55.370
- Objection!
- Sustained.

26:55.370 --> 26:57.370
- The only way to stop
a bad guy with a gun

26:57.370 --> 26:59.270
is a good guy with a gun?

26:59.270 --> 27:01.170
- That's right.
Virginia tech.

27:01.170 --> 27:03.110
Sandy hook... they all
could've been prevented.

27:03.110 --> 27:05.240
- If the shooter hadn't
had access to a weapon...

27:05.240 --> 27:07.240
- or if someone took him out

27:07.250 --> 27:08.780
before he started shooting.

27:08.780 --> 27:10.050
- You say potato...

27:10.050 --> 27:11.720
- objection!

27:11.720 --> 27:13.420
- Is that what you taught
your daughter, Mr. Malloy?

27:13.420 --> 27:15.420
If someone points a gun at you,

27:15.420 --> 27:17.420
shoot first and
ask questions later?

27:17.420 --> 27:20.060
- That's right.

27:20.060 --> 27:22.090
- Problem is...

27:22.090 --> 27:25.360
My client didn't have a gun.

27:25.360 --> 27:29.330
Maybe Kennedy
should've asked first.

27:29.330 --> 27:32.440
Maybe then she'd be alive.

27:42.080 --> 27:43.810
Mind if I...

27:43.820 --> 27:45.750
- No, not at all.
- Thanks.

27:45.750 --> 27:47.020
Uh...

27:47.020 --> 27:48.250
Dewars. Neat.

27:48.250 --> 27:50.320
Make it a double.

27:52.420 --> 27:56.060
Either they're getting younger,
or I'm getting older.

27:56.060 --> 27:57.790
- Nice job today.

27:57.800 --> 28:01.260
Attacking both the...
The victim and her father.

28:01.270 --> 28:03.370
- It's the profession
we've chosen...

28:07.240 --> 28:10.170
"A well regulated militia
comma...

28:10.180 --> 28:14.180
"Being necessary to the security
of a free state comma...

28:14.180 --> 28:16.310
"The right of the people
to keep and bear arms

28:16.310 --> 28:18.310
shall not infringed."

28:18.320 --> 28:20.320
- That's the last amendment
I'd expect you to quote

28:20.320 --> 28:21.420
in a bar.

28:21.420 --> 28:22.550
- The crazy thing...

28:22.550 --> 28:24.450
Me and you, we might not be here

28:24.460 --> 28:27.260
if not for
that pesky second comma.

28:27.260 --> 28:29.030
- And justice scalia.

28:29.030 --> 28:31.260
- May he rest in peace.

28:31.260 --> 28:32.460
Only he could find

28:32.460 --> 28:34.360
an individual's
right to bear arms

28:34.370 --> 28:36.300
in a punctuation mark.

28:36.300 --> 28:40.400
And not even an interesting one
like a colon or an ellipsis.

28:43.270 --> 28:46.280
- The second amendment ensures
that every American has

28:46.280 --> 28:48.110
the right to protect himself.

28:48.110 --> 28:50.450
- What if James Madison's
finger just slipped,

28:50.450 --> 28:53.320
or his quill blotted?

28:53.320 --> 28:58.320
What if that second comma
was actually unintended?

28:58.320 --> 29:00.190
- Then a lot of
living, breathing,

29:00.190 --> 29:03.460
innocent people might be dead.

29:03.460 --> 29:06.530
- You say potato.

29:09.870 --> 29:12.570
- Bethany was one of
my best students.

29:12.570 --> 29:14.340
Smart. Enthusiastic.

29:14.340 --> 29:17.140
Always prepared.

29:17.140 --> 29:20.310
I never heard Bethany so much as
raise her voice toward anyone.

29:20.310 --> 29:21.480
- What about Kennedy?

29:21.480 --> 29:24.210
- Kennedy was more outgoing.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.620
More self-assured.

29:25.620 --> 29:27.380
Dismissive of authority.

29:27.390 --> 29:29.150
Always ready to argue.

29:29.150 --> 29:31.290
- With you?
- With anyone.

29:31.290 --> 29:33.420
She and her other classmate
got into an argument

29:33.430 --> 29:36.560
over a line in "Daisy Miller."

29:36.560 --> 29:38.360
Long story short,

29:38.360 --> 29:41.430
Kennedy threw her book
at her classmate's head.

29:45.340 --> 29:46.900
- Professor hall.

29:46.910 --> 29:48.470
In your literature class,
you led a discussion

29:48.470 --> 29:50.610
on firearms and gun control,
correct?

29:50.610 --> 29:52.510
- My kids are well informed.

29:52.510 --> 29:54.340
The topic came up.

29:54.350 --> 29:57.180
- What was Kennedy's position
when the topic came up?

29:57.180 --> 29:59.380
- Kennedy was pro-gun.

29:59.380 --> 30:00.550
- And Bethany?

30:00.550 --> 30:03.190
- Anti-gun.

30:03.190 --> 30:04.920
- Is there a chance
your opinion of guns

30:04.920 --> 30:06.920
colored your opinion
of these young women?

30:06.930 --> 30:09.230
- I'm guilty.

30:09.230 --> 30:12.230
Guilty of wanting
our children...

30:12.230 --> 30:14.230
To be able to go to the park...

30:14.230 --> 30:15.970
Or the movies,
and not have to dodge bullets.

30:15.970 --> 30:19.270
- Maybe it's not guns
you oppose, but gun owners?

30:19.270 --> 30:21.270
- They are bored adolescents

30:21.270 --> 30:23.670
yearning for a bigger toy
than the kid down the block,

30:23.680 --> 30:26.140
and when they get it,
they can't help themselves.

30:26.140 --> 30:29.410
It's all about
their testosterone fueled egos.

30:29.410 --> 30:31.650
Now my job, Mr. stone,

30:31.650 --> 30:34.320
is imparting
knowledge and wisdom.

30:34.320 --> 30:36.450
What wisdom is more important

30:36.450 --> 30:39.460
than "don't buy something
that might kill your neighbor?"

30:39.460 --> 30:43.460
- And people who don't
accept your wisdom....

30:45.460 --> 30:47.600
Well...

30:47.600 --> 30:50.700
There will always be
ignorant jackasses.

30:53.540 --> 30:55.370
- Just so you know...

30:55.370 --> 30:59.210
I own a gun, sir.

30:59.210 --> 31:02.310
- Figures.

31:07.280 --> 31:09.020
- It was dark.

31:09.020 --> 31:10.650
All of the sudden,
Kennedy was there,

31:10.660 --> 31:14.560
standing with
a gun pointed at my face.

31:14.560 --> 31:16.490
I panicked.

31:16.490 --> 31:19.960
I thought I was going to die.

31:19.970 --> 31:22.270
I grabbed the gun.

31:22.270 --> 31:25.270
We struggled.
It went off.

31:25.270 --> 31:28.270
- Had you and Kennedy
ever had words before?

31:28.270 --> 31:30.540
- I never even saw her
until that night.

31:30.540 --> 31:33.640
- Thank you.

31:38.380 --> 31:40.650
- You never called
the police, did you?

31:40.650 --> 31:42.420
- No.
- Instead,

31:42.420 --> 31:45.250
you hid the gun and
continued playing the game.

31:45.260 --> 31:46.690
- I didn't know what to do.

31:46.690 --> 31:48.520
I was scared.

31:48.530 --> 31:50.530
- So scared you were willing
to let another classmate

31:50.530 --> 31:52.530
take the fall?
- Kennedy was pointing a gun.

31:52.530 --> 31:54.500
- So you assumed
she was going to kill you?

31:54.500 --> 31:55.630
- Yes!

31:55.630 --> 31:58.070
Only crazy people have guns.

31:58.070 --> 31:59.640
Look at all the mass shootings.

31:59.640 --> 32:01.500
Orlando.
San Bernardino.

32:01.510 --> 32:03.270
If I didn't try to take her gun,

32:03.270 --> 32:05.270
who knows what else
would've happened.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.540
- Did you know that 2.5 million
lives are saved each year

32:07.550 --> 32:09.450
by the use of firearms?

32:09.450 --> 32:11.350
200,000 of them are women.

32:11.350 --> 32:12.780
- It's propaganda.

32:12.780 --> 32:14.650
Just once,
I'd like one of these maniacs

32:14.650 --> 32:16.550
to shoot up an nra office.

32:16.550 --> 32:19.660
Things would change in a hurry.

32:23.760 --> 32:27.400
I shot Kennedy...

32:27.400 --> 32:30.670
And I'm really sorry...

32:30.670 --> 32:33.740
But I thought
she was going to shoot me.

32:49.820 --> 32:51.590
- Tough day?

32:51.590 --> 32:53.560
- Losing always is.

32:53.560 --> 32:56.490
- They're buying
all that self-defense crap?

32:56.490 --> 32:59.430
- Forensics says
there may have been a struggle.

32:59.430 --> 33:02.430
Kennedy's dad looks like
a paranoid gun nut

33:02.430 --> 33:05.670
who didn't want his spoiled baby
bothered by the riffraff.

33:05.670 --> 33:08.810
Her professor painted her as
a gun-toting hothead.

33:08.810 --> 33:10.810
Meanwhile,
Bethany is the scared,

33:10.810 --> 33:12.380
little Kansas farm girl

33:12.380 --> 33:13.780
who didn't know the victim,

33:13.780 --> 33:15.410
and therefore
had no motive to kill.

33:15.410 --> 33:16.680
- Wait.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.780
Bethany said
she didn't know Kennedy?

33:18.780 --> 33:21.420
- Didn't meet her
till that night.

33:21.420 --> 33:23.720
- There's a chance
Bethany's full of it.

33:23.720 --> 33:25.460
That story she gave Abigail.

33:25.460 --> 33:26.720
- About the rich girl on campus

33:26.720 --> 33:28.620
whose daddy bought her
a fur coat?

33:28.630 --> 33:31.730
- You think it's Kennedy?

33:33.130 --> 33:35.500
- I don't see how I can help.

33:35.500 --> 33:38.100
- Bethany testified
she didn't know Kennedy.

33:38.100 --> 33:40.100
You can prove she was lying.

33:40.110 --> 33:41.600
- Another courtroom...

33:41.610 --> 33:42.870
- You're not on trial this time.

33:42.870 --> 33:44.340
Just think of it as
a conversation

33:44.340 --> 33:45.510
between you and me.

33:45.510 --> 33:47.580
- What about the other lawyer?

33:47.580 --> 33:49.710
- Bethany was gonna let you take
the blame for Kennedy's murder.

33:49.710 --> 33:52.820
If we hadn't found the gun...

33:54.180 --> 33:57.750
- Have you ever put someone
away, Mr. stone...

33:57.760 --> 34:00.820
Who you weren't sure
was 100% guilty?

34:04.160 --> 34:06.430
- Yes.

34:08.600 --> 34:11.199
- Do you ever think about them?

34:11.199 --> 34:13.440
- I do.

34:14.870 --> 34:17.870
- What if I say I can't do it?

34:17.880 --> 34:21.179
- Then Kennedy's murder
may go unpunished.

34:24.620 --> 34:27.719
- It's up to you.

34:35.760 --> 34:40.760
Most people stared at me,
or whispered behind my back,

34:40.770 --> 34:42.670
but Bethany...

34:42.670 --> 34:45.940
She sat next to me
in a coffee shop one day.

34:45.940 --> 34:48.870
She thought that
we might be kindred spirits.

34:48.870 --> 34:50.670
- How so?

34:50.679 --> 34:53.679
- She said that we were both
outsiders on campus.

34:53.679 --> 34:56.679
She was from
Fontana, Kansas, and...

34:56.679 --> 34:59.620
I was from a Spanish prison.

34:59.620 --> 35:01.220
- Would you say
you became friends?

35:01.220 --> 35:02.790
- Yeah.

35:02.790 --> 35:05.190
We both lost our fathers...

35:05.190 --> 35:07.190
Although, hers died.

35:07.190 --> 35:09.190
Mine just...

35:09.190 --> 35:11.630
Ran away.

35:11.630 --> 35:15.460
But she let me read a story
she wrote about her dad.

35:15.470 --> 35:18.470
About how her life
would've been different...

35:18.470 --> 35:20.200
If he didn't die.

35:20.210 --> 35:24.210
- Can you describe the story?

35:24.210 --> 35:25.780
- He was rich,

35:25.780 --> 35:29.250
and he gave his daughter
anything she wanted.

35:29.250 --> 35:33.680
- Did Bethany base the character
on anyone she knew?

35:33.690 --> 35:36.820
- She based it
on Kennedy Malloy.

35:36.820 --> 35:40.720
- So if Bethany said in court
that she didn't know Kennedy...

35:40.730 --> 35:43.790
- she'd definitely be lying.

35:45.900 --> 35:48.000
- Thank you.

35:50.570 --> 35:53.300
- The police arrested you
for killing Kennedy.

35:53.300 --> 35:55.300
Is that right?
- Yes.

35:55.310 --> 35:57.310
- Did you ever tell them
about the story

35:57.310 --> 35:59.740
my client allegedly wrote?

35:59.740 --> 36:02.010
- No.
- Why not?

36:02.010 --> 36:05.480
- After what I went through
in Spain...

36:05.480 --> 36:07.880
I didn't know for sure
if Bethany had killed Kennedy.

36:07.890 --> 36:09.750
She was my friend.

36:09.750 --> 36:11.850
I didn't want her
to go through what I did.

36:11.860 --> 36:13.860
- When you killed
your boyfriend?

36:13.860 --> 36:15.990
- Approach, your h...
- No need, Mr. stone.

36:15.990 --> 36:17.630
You're out of line,
professor bannon.

36:17.630 --> 36:19.500
- True or false, Ms. Chapman?

36:19.500 --> 36:22.500
There's an outstanding order
of extradition against you

36:22.500 --> 36:25.030
to be returned to Spain
for retrial.

36:25.040 --> 36:26.940
True or false?

36:26.940 --> 36:30.040
True or false!
- True!

36:53.500 --> 36:56.870
- I had this history professor.

36:56.870 --> 37:00.470
He was smart.
Charismatic.

37:00.470 --> 37:01.940
He could tell you
everything about France

37:01.940 --> 37:03.840
from the first revolution
to the present.

37:03.840 --> 37:06.580
As far as I was concerned,
he walked on water.

37:06.580 --> 37:11.010
We got close...
- do I want to hear this?

37:11.020 --> 37:13.620
- "Just once,
I'd like one of these maniacs

37:13.620 --> 37:15.450
"to shoot up an nra office.

37:15.450 --> 37:16.950
Things would change in a hurry."

37:16.950 --> 37:19.960
That's Bethany on cross.

37:19.960 --> 37:22.830
Now professor hall...

37:22.830 --> 37:25.830
<i>- Gun owners
are the enemy, people.</i>

37:25.830 --> 37:28.430
<i>Just once,
I'd like one of these maniacs</i>

37:28.430 --> 37:30.000
<i>to shoot up an nra office.</i>

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
<i>Things would change in a hurry.</i>

37:32.000 --> 37:34.000
- Verbatim.

37:34.010 --> 37:37.610
- I would have done anything
for my history professor.

37:37.610 --> 37:40.580
He's what I wished
my father would be...

37:40.580 --> 37:43.650
Bannon said he's going to call
Bethany for surrebuttal.

37:46.080 --> 37:49.390
- Just might work.
Smart.

37:51.090 --> 37:52.920
- Yes, I wrote the story,

37:52.920 --> 37:55.590
but I honestly don't know
how Abigail got it.

37:55.590 --> 37:57.590
- Why's that?

37:57.600 --> 37:59.560
- Abigail was odd.

37:59.560 --> 38:02.130
I don't even remember
ever talking to her.

38:02.130 --> 38:05.130
- So your story
wasn't about Kennedy?

38:05.140 --> 38:07.870
- No. It was a fantasy,

38:07.870 --> 38:10.970
about what my life would be
like if dad had lived.

38:21.120 --> 38:25.590
- This is the story
in question, is it not?

38:25.590 --> 38:27.160
- It is.

38:27.160 --> 38:28.620
- Please read
those last few lines.

38:28.630 --> 38:30.690
They're highlighted.

38:33.700 --> 38:37.700
- "But dad is gone,
and this was all a dream.

38:37.700 --> 38:40.440
"But sometimes, dreams are
right there in front of us,

38:40.440 --> 38:44.440
and all we have to do
is reach out and touch them."

38:44.440 --> 38:47.440
- That's very beautiful.
I'm...

38:47.450 --> 38:49.150
I'm surprised
you never shared it to anyone.

38:49.150 --> 38:50.980
- I might have.

38:50.980 --> 38:52.520
- Who would that be?

38:52.520 --> 38:54.150
- Not Abigail Chapman,
that's for sure.

38:54.150 --> 38:56.150
- Professor hall?

38:56.150 --> 38:58.620
He said you were one of
his best students.

38:58.620 --> 39:00.190
- Yes, I showed it to him.

39:00.190 --> 39:02.660
- What did he say?

39:02.660 --> 39:04.590
- He liked it.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.430
He said I could be a writer.

39:06.430 --> 39:07.660
Said he would help.

39:07.670 --> 39:09.970
- Did he help you?
- Yes.

39:09.970 --> 39:11.770
- After class?

39:11.770 --> 39:14.770
- Sometimes, but it's not
what you're suggesting.

39:14.770 --> 39:16.710
He was my teacher.
That's all.

39:16.710 --> 39:18.810
- Your favorite teacher?
- Yes.

39:20.640 --> 39:22.650
- He read your stories.

39:22.650 --> 39:25.650
He knew what was going on
in your head.

39:25.650 --> 39:27.650
In your heart.

39:27.650 --> 39:31.020
He knew you like
a father knows his daughter.

39:31.020 --> 39:33.620
Your dream, the one that was
standing right in front of you,

39:33.620 --> 39:35.060
close enough for you to touch?

39:35.060 --> 39:36.530
- Objection!

39:36.530 --> 39:38.090
Mr. stone is testifying,
your honor.

39:38.100 --> 39:40.100
- Sustained.
- Professor hall was that dream!

39:40.100 --> 39:41.630
- Your honor!
- He was the closest thing

39:41.630 --> 39:44.730
to a dad you ever had.
Isn't that right?

39:49.540 --> 39:51.570
- I don't know.

39:51.580 --> 39:53.580
- What would you do
if he left the school?

39:53.580 --> 39:56.110
- He won't leave.
He has tenure.

39:56.110 --> 39:58.110
- But let's say the audio
recording that Kennedy had

39:58.120 --> 40:00.580
of professor hall ranting
about the evils of guns

40:00.590 --> 40:02.250
got out to cable news?

40:02.250 --> 40:04.190
I'm sure the trustees
wouldn't like that at all,

40:04.190 --> 40:06.520
and professor hall's tenure
would be worthless, wouldn't it?

40:06.520 --> 40:07.590
And there goes your dream.

40:07.590 --> 40:09.230
Just like that.

40:09.230 --> 40:11.230
You couldn't let Kennedy
destroy your dream, could you?

40:11.230 --> 40:13.830
- I tried to talk to Kennedy...

40:13.830 --> 40:16.270
But she wouldn't leave
professor hall alone.

40:16.270 --> 40:19.740
That bitch's father
gave her everything!

40:19.740 --> 40:22.810
Why did she want
to take mine away?

40:43.830 --> 40:47.600
- In the case of the people of
Illinois vs. Bethany pierson,

40:47.600 --> 40:49.230
on the sole count of
the indictment,

40:49.230 --> 40:50.800
first degree murder,

40:50.800 --> 40:52.700
the people find the defendant...

40:52.700 --> 40:54.140
Guilty.

41:08.150 --> 41:10.150
- Huh.

41:10.150 --> 41:13.890
I remember
Gail's first year in college.

41:13.890 --> 41:15.790
She came home and yelled at me

41:15.790 --> 41:19.090
for taking part
in an illegal war.

41:19.100 --> 41:22.100
Some hippie,
draft dodger professor

41:22.100 --> 41:24.230
taught her I was the enemy.

41:24.240 --> 41:28.670
- I yelled at my parents for
wiping out the native Americans.

41:28.670 --> 41:31.740
- When did people start
going to college to get stupid?

41:34.810 --> 41:38.710
- We would've lost the case
without her, mark...

41:38.720 --> 41:40.720
- You think I'm the enemy, too?

41:40.720 --> 41:43.620
- I think you're a hero.

41:43.620 --> 41:46.620
- You're full of...

41:46.620 --> 41:49.760
Get me the damn
secretary of state.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.590
What's the girl's name?
Abigail...

41:51.600 --> 41:53.600
- Chapman.

41:53.600 --> 41:55.700
Thank you.
