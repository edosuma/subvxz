Arch!

-[Gumm-Gumms grunt]
-Ha, ha! Always hated those twits.

00:47.005 --> 00:48.131
Fight on!

00:48.214 --> 00:50.008
The day isn't over yet!

00:51.301 --> 00:52.302

00:52.635 --> 00:55.054
-[man] Look about!

[grunting]

01:06.149 --> 01:07.358
[Douxie] Morgana's returned!

01:07.442 --> 01:08.693
She's enemy number one!

01:08.985 --> 01:10.361
Go! We'll hold the bridge!

01:10.445 --> 01:12.238
Hisirdoux, with me!

01:13.239 --> 01:15.116
-[panting]
-[owl hoots]

01:16.993 --> 01:18.703
I feel dark magic.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.789
[Merlin] It means she's close.

[gasps]

01:24.042 --> 01:25.168
[Morgana chuckles]

01:25.251 --> 01:30.215
An old man and a foolish boy,
lost as always.

01:30.632 --> 01:32.258
Do you dare run...

01:33.134 --> 01:35.428
or face my vengeance?

01:36.554 --> 01:38.681
[Archie] Um, is there a third option?

01:39.641 --> 01:41.476
-[gasps]
-[grunts]

01:43.603 --> 01:46.314
[grunts] Hisirdoux, run!

02:21.474 --> 02:23.476
Rally, Knights of the Round!

02:23.560 --> 02:25.937
Humanity will not go quietly this day!

02:26.020 --> 02:28.940
[screams, grunts]

02:29.023 --> 02:30.358
-Waka chaka!
-With me!

02:30.441 --> 02:32.485
-Drive them back!
-Yeah!

02:32.569 --> 02:33.987
I ain't afraid of no creeps!

02:34.070 --> 02:36.197
-For Camelot!
-Yeah!

02:38.825 --> 02:39.826
-[Steve] Hey!
-Huh?

02:39.909 --> 02:44.414
Big nasty, I can't tell which end's
your face and what's your butt!

02:44.914 --> 02:48.251
[Lancelot] Astounding!
You are indeed a master wordsmith.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.961
[growls]

02:50.044 --> 02:51.796
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

02:51.880 --> 02:56.009
The bigger they are,
the easier they are to... hit.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.594
Hey, yeah, teamwork!

02:57.677 --> 03:00.388
Well done! Let's keep cracking!

03:00.680 --> 03:03.224
[grunting]

03:04.058 --> 03:05.435
[Morgana cackles]

03:06.686 --> 03:09.439
-Merlin!
-[groans]

03:09.522 --> 03:10.398
You're injured!

03:10.899 --> 03:12.692
-Badly.
-[groans]

03:12.775 --> 03:16.279
Hisirdoux, if I should fall this day...

03:17.989 --> 03:20.617
-"Heart of Avalon"?
-"Building a tomb"?

03:20.783 --> 03:21.951
Why are you giving me this?

03:22.035 --> 03:26.331
Foreseeing the future
means preparing for the worst of it,

03:26.414 --> 03:28.750
including your wounded friend.

03:29.083 --> 03:30.627
Jim? What about him?

03:30.710 --> 03:33.922
The corruption in his heart has no cure.

03:34.088 --> 03:38.092
When he returns to the future,
it will overtake him.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.720
No! No, there must be some other way.

03:40.803 --> 03:45.266
I made a promise to them, to Claire,
to get them home alive, all of them!

03:45.350 --> 03:50.146
Yet, to save time itself,
you all must return home,

03:50.230 --> 03:54.692
even if it means
James Lake will be no more.

03:55.818 --> 03:56.861
[sighs]

03:56.945 --> 03:59.614
Such is the burden of a wizard--

03:59.989 --> 04:04.327
to make the hard choices mortals cannot.
[grunts]

04:04.827 --> 04:08.289
Now it is yours to bear.

04:12.418 --> 04:13.378
[grunts]

04:14.170 --> 04:16.714
Morgana, reveal thyself!

04:19.550 --> 04:22.387
Look what has wandered into my web.

04:22.470 --> 04:25.556
These are dark powers
you meddle with, Morgana.

04:25.640 --> 04:29.477
Who granted them?
Who resurrected you from death?

04:29.560 --> 04:32.105
Wizards beyond your ken.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.357
You three aren't going anywhere.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.401
I have a king to slay.

04:56.337 --> 05:00.883
Fight by my side, my son.
We'll carve a path to the bridge!

05:00.967 --> 05:02.802
They will suffer!

05:02.969 --> 05:06.889
Gunmar, you have terrorized
this realm for too long!

05:06.973 --> 05:08.474
It ends here!

05:08.558 --> 05:11.352
You cannot win, little king!

05:11.436 --> 05:15.315
The surface lands belong to my kind!
[grunts]

05:15.398 --> 05:18.151

Hi.

You fight one knight, you fight all of us!

05:30.872 --> 05:32.081

to strike down this tyrant.

05:59.650 --> 06:00.985
[rasps]

06:01.277 --> 06:03.654
Your reign of terror is over.

06:03.821 --> 06:05.865
[Bellroc] Unacceptable!

06:05.948 --> 06:07.950
We cannot intervene.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.161
There will be consequences.

06:10.244 --> 06:12.413
[Bellroc] Enough waiting.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.751
[men grunting]

06:18.294 --> 06:19.670
[Claire] The Arcane Order?

06:19.962 --> 06:20.880
They're here?

06:21.089 --> 06:23.966
We may have come to the end of days!

06:24.050 --> 06:25.218
-Charge!
-[all yelling]

06:28.096 --> 06:29.180
[Morgana] Brother!

06:32.642 --> 06:35.645
We have some unresolved issues.

06:35.853 --> 06:38.272
Sister? You're alive?

06:39.357 --> 06:41.609
[grunts] Stop this!

06:41.943 --> 06:43.736
Our blood is the same.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.154
Is that so?

06:45.238 --> 06:48.491
Then let's spill some of yours
and make sure!

You were right.

07:35.204 --> 07:36.581
It is like you said.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.380
We are all the same.

07:45.548 --> 07:50.261
I have wronged you,
as I have all creatures in my realm.

07:50.344 --> 07:54.640
I now fight to save them
from the violence I have sown.

07:54.849 --> 07:59.937
This carnage, these deaths,
we can end this.

08:00.021 --> 08:02.732
This-- This is a lie.

08:02.815 --> 08:03.858
A trick!

08:04.025 --> 08:06.444
No, this is our redemption.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.867
I should have listened to you.

-Brother!

No!

Go finish it!

It's your fault!
You're the reason Arthur is gone!

-What?
-Gone?

09:03.334 --> 09:05.086
Take down the bridge!

Yes! We are here to not run away!

Well said, brother!

10:33.633 --> 10:35.718
You fight like a lady.

10:35.801 --> 10:38.554
Oh, I don't, but I have a friend who does.

Be brave, brother!

That's not exactly how that works,
but thank you, nonetheless.

11:31.649 --> 11:34.193
We must find my brother.
This way, quickly!

11:36.112 --> 11:40.574
She's too powerful!
We have no choice but to seal her away!

12:22.408 --> 12:23.868

12:32.668 --> 12:35.296
Well, this is technically an "axe."

Hisirdoux, this is no time
for dreadful music!

12:39.675 --> 12:42.136
-Dreadful?
-Absolutely infernal.

No worries,
this is just the opening track!

12:46.098 --> 12:49.268
What do you hope to do?
Blow out our eardrums?

12:49.477 --> 12:53.314
Well, pardon me if this rock

13:57.253 --> 13:59.588
You've lost yourself, Morgana!

13:59.672 --> 14:01.840
Bound to dark magic.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.593
I have no choice but to seal you away!

14:04.969 --> 14:08.013
<i>Sigilia infractum!</i>

14:09.098 --> 14:09.932
[grunts]

14:10.015 --> 14:13.769
-[groans] She's too powerful.
-Master!

14:13.852 --> 14:16.105
You have to finish this alone.

14:17.356 --> 14:19.775
<i>Sigilia infractum!</i>

14:20.568 --> 14:21.527
<i>Causera!</i>

14:23.946 --> 14:26.699
[grunting]

14:26.782 --> 14:29.285
I will destroy you all!

14:29.368 --> 14:31.912
No matter what it takes,
no matter where you go,

14:31.996 --> 14:37.126
I will end all that you love
until you feel my agony!

14:38.294 --> 14:41.130
Hey! Hands off my teacher!

14:41.213 --> 14:45.009
I swear on your lives, I shall rise again!

14:45.092 --> 14:47.511
Already seen it. You don't win.

14:47.595 --> 14:49.638
See you in 900 years!

14:54.602 --> 14:56.687
[Morgana screams]

14:58.397 --> 15:01.150
-[grunts]
-Douxie! Are you okay?

15:01.233 --> 15:04.862
-Ugh! That's-- That's disgusting!
-[chuckles]

15:05.321 --> 15:07.406
[sighs] Well...

15:07.948 --> 15:09.783
I think we just saved history.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.870
And took down a ninth-level sorceress.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.414
-Merlin would be proud.
-[snoring]

15:16.081 --> 15:19.543
Yeah, if he wasn't out cold.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.046
[roaring]

15:22.379 --> 15:25.341
-[grunting]
-[Steve] Ow!

15:25.424 --> 15:26.842
[screaming]

15:30.763 --> 15:31.931
-[grunts]
-[yells]

15:36.185 --> 15:37.394
-[screams]
-[grunts]

15:39.438 --> 15:41.649
-Ha!
-She's awesome!

15:41.732 --> 15:44.360
Like some sort of super Troll fighter!

15:44.443 --> 15:47.696
Yeah, but we need to get her
to the bridge and past him.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.616
-[grunts]
-[men screaming]

15:50.699 --> 15:53.035
-Your king is gone!
-[man yells]

15:53.118 --> 15:57.623
The only thing that rules now is fear.

16:00.542 --> 16:02.503
Come, my brothers and sisters!

16:03.003 --> 16:08.425
I know you're afraid, but never forget
that fear is the precursor to valor.

16:08.634 --> 16:10.469
[all yelling]

16:10.678 --> 16:14.098
[Deya] And to strive and triumph
in the face of fear

16:14.181 --> 16:17.351
is what it means to be a hero!

16:17.851 --> 16:20.562
Together, we push back the darkness

16:20.646 --> 16:23.399
and those that would see our end!

16:23.482 --> 16:26.110
We got your back, Deya! Get to the bridge!

16:26.318 --> 16:27.695
For glory!

16:27.861 --> 16:29.822
[Bellroc] Mundane, simple creature.

16:29.905 --> 16:31.782
You stain magic.

16:31.865 --> 16:33.909
You are nothing in our eyes.

16:36.787 --> 16:40.708
[screams]

16:45.170 --> 16:48.590
[grunts, shrieks]

16:49.091 --> 16:52.052
[Gunmar pants]

16:52.136 --> 16:54.596
[chuckles] Wanna dance, big horns?

16:54.763 --> 16:55.806
<i>Bushigal!</i>

16:55.889 --> 17:00.227
How did a gutter Troll strike down
a formidable wizard?

17:00.310 --> 17:01.895
[growls, snorts]

17:01.979 --> 17:04.314
I won't fall so easy.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.900
[grunting]

17:11.321 --> 17:14.450
[Jim] Now, Deya!
Put the Amulet in the bridge!

17:15.576 --> 17:17.119
[both grunt]

17:21.248 --> 17:24.209
[both yelling]

17:32.843 --> 17:34.053
-[Gunmar growls]
-[Deya grunts]

17:35.345 --> 17:36.764
[screaming]

17:36.847 --> 17:39.141
[grunts, pants]

17:39.224 --> 17:42.478
Who are you that has brought
the end of Trolls?

17:42.561 --> 17:44.438
Deya, the Trollhunter.

17:44.521 --> 17:47.733
And all I bring is the end of you!

17:47.816 --> 17:49.401
-[yells]
-[grunts]

18:00.704 --> 18:01.622
[yelps]

18:02.331 --> 18:04.374
Oh, buckets!

18:07.586 --> 18:10.506
Thank you, Trollhunter.

18:10.589 --> 18:12.966
You delivered us.

18:13.175 --> 18:16.011
[all] Hail, Deya the Deliverer!

18:17.763 --> 18:19.640
I couldn't have done this
without you, Jim.

18:19.723 --> 18:22.226
You're going to do great things, Deya.

18:22.309 --> 18:26.146
Oh, and when you're looking
for a new Heartstone, skip New Jersey.

18:26.230 --> 18:28.857
Trust me, California has better weather.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.860
-[indistinct chatter]
-[horse snorts]

18:31.944 --> 18:33.362
Goodbye, Lancelot.

18:33.695 --> 18:35.489
I'll remember everything you taught me.

18:35.572 --> 18:39.243
I'll reform the Round Table,
the knights will fight again,

18:39.493 --> 18:41.870
and they'll all have great hair.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.540
[rumbling]

18:45.207 --> 18:46.500
[man] Look, the castle!

18:46.583 --> 18:48.293
[woman] That is so strange!

18:48.377 --> 18:50.712
-[man] Whoa!
-[Galahad] Imagine! [chuckles]

18:50.838 --> 18:52.381
Blessed be!

18:52.464 --> 18:57.886
Have you ever seen such a good sight?
[chuckles]

18:59.304 --> 19:03.225
We miscalculated. The balance is lost.

19:04.518 --> 19:07.437
I feel so much pain.

19:07.980 --> 19:10.607
So many lives lost.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.651
This was not worth it.

19:13.026 --> 19:17.614
We will readjust and return in time.

19:18.782 --> 19:20.826
Oh, brother.

19:20.909 --> 19:23.787
Torn from this mortal coil!

19:23.871 --> 19:26.373
How will I carry on without you?

19:26.582 --> 19:28.917
Aaarrrgghh alone, too.

19:29.001 --> 19:33.172
Aaarrrgghh and Blinky be alone together?

19:33.881 --> 19:35.716
I would enjoy a companion.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.970
-[chuckles]
-[yelps, chuckles]

19:44.892 --> 19:47.936
Everybody, ready yourselves.
We don't have much time.

19:48.020 --> 19:49.521
I'll dial us in for when we left.

19:49.605 --> 19:51.690
But what's gonna happen when we get there?

19:51.773 --> 19:54.568
The danger we escaped,
it'll be waiting for us.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.361
And Jim's still hurt.

19:56.445 --> 19:58.572
Claire, about that...

19:58.655 --> 20:01.617
-Jim is--
-Ready to face the inevitable.

20:01.700 --> 20:03.368
Jim, are you sure?

20:03.660 --> 20:05.537
-Jim?
-[sighs]

20:07.206 --> 20:09.458
Claire, the shard in...

20:09.917 --> 20:11.460
There is no cure.

20:11.627 --> 20:14.046
-[gasps]
-That's what Merlin told me earlier.

20:14.129 --> 20:16.882
That's crazy! We can find something!

20:16.965 --> 20:19.218
I'll learn a spell. We can stay here.

20:19.301 --> 20:23.430
If we don't all go back right now,
the future won't exist.

20:23.513 --> 20:26.725
And what kind of hero would I be
if I sacrificed everyone else?

20:27.100 --> 20:30.062
Not to be ironic, but we're out of time.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.230
No!

20:31.313 --> 20:34.191
Douxie, tell him! We can fix this!

20:34.274 --> 20:35.567
You can fix this!

20:35.651 --> 20:37.694
I'm sorry, Claire. He's right.

20:38.111 --> 20:42.115
We must go back now, but when we do,
we'll find a way to reverse this.

20:42.199 --> 20:44.910
I promised I would
return you home, and I am,

20:44.993 --> 20:47.955
but the portal can only stay open
for a few moments.

20:48.121 --> 20:50.666
This is our one shot. Trust me.

20:55.170 --> 20:57.547
You said to make the tough calls, old man.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.633
I hope I'm doing the right thing.

21:00.300 --> 21:03.262
[energy charges]

21:15.607 --> 21:16.733
[crowd gasps]

21:19.069 --> 21:20.946
There has to be another way.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.322
This isn't fair!

21:22.406 --> 21:25.117
That seems to be
a reoccurring thing with us.

21:25.200 --> 21:27.077
You sure you wanna keep dating me?

21:27.411 --> 21:31.164
I'd date you for a hundred lifetimes,
Jim Lake.

21:31.248 --> 21:33.208
Hey, we'll figure this out.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.544
We always find a way to save each other.

21:37.671 --> 21:41.216
Farewell, and thanks, fellow Trollhunter.

21:41.425 --> 21:44.219
Goodbye, me! Ooh! Ooh, ooh!

21:44.303 --> 21:49.349
I'll finish all the tasks you gave me,
even if it takes centuries!

21:53.979 --> 21:56.273
Man, Camelot was crazy!

21:56.356 --> 21:58.984
Why don't they ever talk about that
in the history books?

22:03.905 --> 22:05.699
My burden to bear.

22:13.373 --> 22:16.251
[theme music playing]
