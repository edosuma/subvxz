00:05.891 --> 00:09.474
Woman:
Wait. I'm starting
to rethink the beige.

00:09.557 --> 00:12.140
I know you're closing up,
but what about these?

00:12.224 --> 00:14.307
These are gonna run you
considerably more,

00:14.391 --> 00:16.015
'cause they're
made to order.

00:16.099 --> 00:19.766
My guy in Perugia is
a fifth-generation tile maker.

00:19.849 --> 00:22.849
He and his brother
hand-paint each and every one.

00:22.933 --> 00:25.891
-His brother
lost a hand.
-His leg.

00:25.974 --> 00:28.391
Oh right. His leg.
Anyway...

00:28.474 --> 00:30.933
-Well, they're
really beautiful.
-Aren't they?

00:31.015 --> 00:34.182
I've been working
with Enzo and his family
for almost 40 years.

00:34.265 --> 00:38.265
-Oh, wow.
-He's the best.
Very unique designs.

00:38.349 --> 00:40.140
Here, why don't I give
you a card,

00:40.224 --> 00:42.849
and you can look
at the whole gallery online.

00:42.933 --> 00:44.849
Woman:
Oh shoot!
Look at those.

00:44.933 --> 00:47.516
I thought I knew,
now I have no idea.

00:47.599 --> 00:50.015
(laughing):
Well, there's no hurry.

00:50.099 --> 00:51.766
You're gonna be looking
at that wall everyday.

00:51.849 --> 00:54.683
Why don't you take
your time and come
back to us.

00:54.766 --> 00:57.432
Thank you, I'll
definitely be back.
This has been great.

00:57.516 --> 00:58.808
It sure has.

00:58.891 --> 01:01.724
-Okay, thanks, Mamie.
-Bye-bye. Take care.

01:01.808 --> 01:05.683
-Oh my God, I thought
she'd never leave.
-Tell me about it.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.557
Let's blow this dump.

01:13.182 --> 01:16.974
Mamie:
So, if he can't guarantee
his delivery by next month,

01:17.057 --> 01:18.724
what use do we have
for him?

01:18.808 --> 01:22.099
-I'm gonna take my business
elsewhere, you know?
-Uh-huh.

01:22.182 --> 01:25.474
Why do you do that?
You're gonna run
into something.

01:25.557 --> 01:27.182
It's my friend, Ruby.

01:27.265 --> 01:29.933
She's asking if you'd
ever consider modeling.

01:30.015 --> 01:31.849
What? Modeling?

01:31.933 --> 01:33.724
Yeah, it's for a campaign
she's producing.

01:33.808 --> 01:36.057
She's just seen you
on my Instagram.

01:36.140 --> 01:38.015
-Instagram?
Let me see.
-Mm-hmm.

01:38.099 --> 01:40.015
Come on.
I'm not a model.

01:40.099 --> 01:42.432
They don't want models,
that's the whole point.

01:42.516 --> 01:43.641
I don't understand.
Why me?

01:43.724 --> 01:45.808
Are you kidding me,
Mamie? Look at you.

01:45.891 --> 01:47.307
Exactly! Look at me.

01:47.391 --> 01:49.516
Is this the body
and face of a model?

01:49.599 --> 01:51.766
-You are fixated
on that word, "model."
-Wheeler,

01:51.849 --> 01:54.516
you're the one who's trying
to convince me to be a model.

01:54.599 --> 01:57.766
-Okay, fair, but--
-You're a beautiful woman!

01:57.849 --> 01:59.766
Rivka:
Yeah, and your fabulous
clothes? Come on!

01:59.849 --> 02:02.724
-Wheeler: Right? You're iconic.
-Mamie: Oh, well, let's not get
carried away now.

02:02.808 --> 02:05.391
Mary:
I've always said you have
the most interesting face,

02:05.474 --> 02:07.474
-haven't I?
-  Rivka:  Why is
this so shocking?

02:07.557 --> 02:10.974
Mamie:
I don't know. It's not like
I was trying to get noticed
or something--

02:11.057 --> 02:13.516
Mary:
Well, you certainly    weren't
trying to be invisible.

02:13.599 --> 02:14.766
Let's get real.
Is there pay?

02:14.849 --> 02:16.265
-Oh, there's pay.
-Yes.

02:16.349 --> 02:19.432
-You didn't say that.
How much?
-It's a fair amount.

02:19.516 --> 02:21.557
It's enough that she can go
on a nice vacation.

02:21.641 --> 02:25.641
-That's a no-brainer to me.
-Mamie, you are fabulous.

02:25.724 --> 02:28.224
Thank you, my love.

02:28.307 --> 02:30.015
-All right.
Let's get dessert.
-Dessert, I want--

02:30.099 --> 02:33.015
No dessert for you.
You're a model now.

02:33.099 --> 02:34.307
(all laughing)

02:34.391 --> 02:36.099
Collier Schorr:
Take a few steps
to your right.

02:36.182 --> 02:38.933
Nice. Look around.
Take a minute...

02:39.015 --> 02:41.557
-Okay, so makeup is
straight ahead.
-Oh, thanks sweetie.

02:41.641 --> 02:44.474
Sara:
Oh my God.
Mamie, right?

02:44.557 --> 02:46.933
Hi! I love that name.

02:47.015 --> 02:49.974
I remember you
'cause that name
is so good. I'm Sara.

02:50.057 --> 02:52.099
(laughing): It's really nice
to meet you, sweetheart.

02:52.182 --> 02:54.474
-You look amazing.
-Well, thank you!

02:54.557 --> 02:56.974
-Okay, let's find Ruby.
-Is this Mamie?

02:57.057 --> 02:58.766
Hi, how are you?
Oh my God!

02:58.849 --> 03:01.015
You look better in person.
How is that even possible?

03:01.099 --> 03:02.808
I feel like I know
you already, too,

03:02.891 --> 03:04.349
'cause Wheeler's always
posting pictures.

03:04.432 --> 03:06.516
Oh, is she? I don't know
what she puts up there.

03:06.599 --> 03:10.683
Sara:
For real though, everyone
is obsessed with you.

03:10.766 --> 03:13.182
Ruby:
Yes, girl, we are obsessed.
Let's go to wardrobe.

03:13.265 --> 03:15.099
Are you hungry?
Do you need
something to eat?

03:15.182 --> 03:18.015
No, I'm good. I would use
the ladies' room, though.

03:18.099 --> 03:20.307
My bladder is the size
of a damn peanut.

03:20.391 --> 03:22.182
Mamie:
Okay if I hang
this stuff here?

03:22.265 --> 03:26.391
Absolutely.
But, cute-ini,
you did my job for me!

03:26.474 --> 03:28.516
-I'm sorry.
-No, no. It's all good.

03:28.599 --> 03:30.599
We just want to start
with a clean, fresh palette.

03:30.683 --> 03:34.474
It's just, I'm so used
to slapping on my customary
spackle in the morning.

03:34.557 --> 03:37.641
I always tell my clients,
just moisturize and drink water.

03:37.724 --> 03:40.265
Those are really the two main
ingredients for good skin.

03:40.349 --> 03:42.265
Of course, here I am
telling you to hydrate

03:42.349 --> 03:44.683
while I suck down
the second coffee
of the day.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.891
Oh, a little coffee
never hurt anybody.

03:46.974 --> 03:49.766
Oh yes, sis,
it dehydrates your skin
and discolors your teeth.

03:49.849 --> 03:53.557
Hey, I'm gonna order
some weed if anyone
wants to get in on it.

03:53.641 --> 03:55.265
Shay: Hell yes.
That sounds good.

03:55.349 --> 03:56.974
Hold a second.

04:03.099 --> 04:05.974
Evan (laughing):
Okay, try to look,
like, disgusted.

04:07.140 --> 04:08.974
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:09.057 --> 04:11.015
Okay, here,
check it out.

04:12.265 --> 04:14.849
(Abdullah laughing)

04:14.933 --> 04:16.974
-Dude, that's
fucking amazing!
-I knew it.

04:17.057 --> 04:19.265
I'm gonna send this
to our mutual friend.

04:19.349 --> 04:21.683
Man, who knew
that finger meat

04:21.766 --> 04:24.057
could look that much
like ass and thigh meat?

04:24.140 --> 04:25.891
Yeah. I guess I did.

04:26.015 --> 04:29.057
Shit, man. Take an item
from the case, man.
Anything you want.

04:29.140 --> 04:32.057
-Really? Well--
-Are you kidding me? Look
at the gift you've given me.

04:32.140 --> 04:34.099
I won't say
no to that.

04:34.182 --> 04:35.974
-You got anymore tricks?
-Oh, yeah. Sure.

04:36.057 --> 04:38.099
(grunting, screaming)

04:38.182 --> 04:41.224
Oh my God, dude!
What the fuck, man?
Are you okay?

04:41.307 --> 04:42.516
Just kidding.

04:42.599 --> 04:44.182
(both laughing)

04:44.265 --> 04:46.140
-Dude, you're
fucking crazy!
-Yeah.

04:46.224 --> 04:47.849
Wait, wait. Hold that.
Let me get some

04:47.933 --> 04:50.015
of my finger ass-meat
in the shot here.

04:50.099 --> 04:51.307
Both:
Ah!

04:51.391 --> 04:52.265
Ooh!

04:52.349 --> 04:54.641
All right, here.
Check this out.

04:54.724 --> 04:57.349
(both laughing)

04:57.432 --> 05:00.099
Wait. You have to show me
how to do that immediately.

05:00.182 --> 05:03.599
Oh my God, it's so easy,
and it's going to change
your life.

05:03.683 --> 05:05.307
Mamie:
Does it make me
look washed-out?

05:05.391 --> 05:06.724
No, yeah. It's great.

05:06.808 --> 05:09.933
-I think it really works.
-It totally works, maybe.

05:11.057 --> 05:13.683
-I'm just kidding.
-Pip!

05:13.766 --> 05:15.599
-Hello, my love.
-Hi boo!

05:15.683 --> 05:18.891
Wow, sis, you are
looking sickening, mate!

05:18.974 --> 05:20.474
Do you even need
to go to makeup?

05:20.557 --> 05:23.140
Honestly, thank God
for y'all. I slept
maybe four hours.

05:23.224 --> 05:25.766
-Well, God bless you,
because you're perfect.
-Amazing.

05:25.849 --> 05:29.265
-So, are we good?
-Yeah, Ma, you look great.

05:29.349 --> 05:31.182
That's the outfit.

05:31.265 --> 05:32.974
Okay, you're all set.

05:33.057 --> 05:34.683
Thank you.

05:36.099 --> 05:39.516
Jojo:
Show us, show us!
What the--

05:39.599 --> 05:42.307
(laughing)

05:42.391 --> 05:44.349
Checking out
the sandwiches?

05:44.432 --> 05:46.599
Can't decide
which one I want.

05:46.683 --> 05:49.724
-Try 'em both.
-Mm, too many calories.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.307
Mamie, are you ready?

05:52.391 --> 05:54.849
Call me Helen Reddy.

05:54.933 --> 05:58.432
Okay, right this way.

05:58.516 --> 06:01.265
-(camera snapping)
-Collier Schorr:
That's great, Mamie.

06:02.349 --> 06:05.015
Okay, take a small
little walk to your right.

06:05.099 --> 06:08.516
Nice. Gentle.
Okay, stop.

06:08.599 --> 06:10.641
Great.

06:10.724 --> 06:13.724
Okay, take it back
to the middle.

06:15.265 --> 06:17.057
Maybe, like,
give a little jump?

06:17.140 --> 06:19.057
-Give a little hop.
-Okay.

06:20.099 --> 06:21.391
Beautiful!

06:22.516 --> 06:23.849
That's perfect.

06:23.933 --> 06:26.808
You look like
you've been doing this
your whole life.

06:26.891 --> 06:28.933
Mamie:
If there's even a little
bit of truth in that,

06:29.015 --> 06:31.557
-it's because of you.
-Well...

06:31.641 --> 06:34.808
I think you were born
in a photo studio.

06:36.182 --> 06:37.724
(whispers): Okay.
You know what?

06:37.808 --> 06:40.391
-We like it when
she smiles better.
-Okay.

06:40.474 --> 06:42.015
Can you give me
one of those smiles?

06:42.099 --> 06:43.891
-From before?
-Okay.

06:43.974 --> 06:46.057
(breathes deeply)

06:46.140 --> 06:49.015
Yeah, that's perfect.

06:50.474 --> 06:53.599
Hey, Mamie, has anyone
ever showed you the fingerbutt?

06:53.683 --> 06:56.933
The fingerbutt? No.

06:58.099 --> 07:00.140
Look like you're shocked.

07:02.557 --> 07:04.391
Mamie (laughing):
Oh my God!

07:04.474 --> 07:06.099
That's great,
that's great.
Liam, Liam--

07:06.182 --> 07:08.724
Liam,
get out of the way.

07:08.808 --> 07:10.307
(laughing):
That's great.

07:10.391 --> 07:12.140
-Yes!
-That's magic, Mamie.

07:12.224 --> 07:15.391
-Yes, Mama!
-Get it girl, yes!

07:15.474 --> 07:16.974
(Wheeler gasps)

07:17.057 --> 07:19.933
Wheeler:
Look at you!
You look luminous!

07:20.015 --> 07:21.599
Your skin is glowing!

07:21.683 --> 07:23.724
Mamie:
Looks like somebody
else's skin.

07:23.808 --> 07:27.224
And look at those teeth.
They glow in the dark,
that's glowing.

07:27.307 --> 07:30.516
Wheeler:
They look beautiful. They look
white and bright and shiny!

07:30.599 --> 07:32.140
Mamie:
They look radioactive.

07:32.224 --> 07:36.599
Wheeler:
I am thrilled.
I know a model!

07:36.683 --> 07:38.849
Rivka:
Wow, full page.

07:41.099 --> 07:44.057
Why do they always find ways
to remind me about my age?

07:44.140 --> 07:47.557
Yeah, like, oh my God,
I think I almost forgot,

07:47.641 --> 07:49.808
I am old.

07:49.891 --> 07:53.057
I never think of my age
until somebody reminds me.

07:53.140 --> 07:55.099
I still feel like I did
when I was 35.

07:55.182 --> 07:58.307
I still feel the same way
as you did when you were 35.

07:58.391 --> 08:02.140
-(laughter)
-God, that is
such a mindfuck.

08:02.224 --> 08:05.057
-Screw them!
You got paid, right?
-Where's the check?

08:05.140 --> 08:07.182
Finally, a month
after the fact.

08:07.265 --> 08:09.349
Ugh, where
are we going?

08:09.432 --> 08:12.432
-I vote Jamaica.
-Waiter: Can I get
you girls another drink?

08:12.516 --> 08:16.599
Oh, yes. We girls
would love another drink.

08:27.307 --> 08:29.474
Mamie:
God damn it.

It's me, see?

09:21.808 --> 09:24.849
Oh, okay.
That's what's up.

09:24.933 --> 09:26.808
(laughing):
Have a good night.

09:26.891 --> 09:29.099
-Hey-hey,
lady, wait!
-What?

09:29.182 --> 09:30.933
You mind if I take
a selfie with you?

09:31.015 --> 09:32.516
No! Come on.

09:32.599 --> 09:34.557
Really? Oh man,
that's cool. All right.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.974
Fix that up.
There you go.

09:37.057 --> 09:40.933
One, two, three-- cheese!

09:43.891 --> 09:45.557
Well, thanks a lot.
All right.

09:45.641 --> 09:47.432
Mamie:
You're welcome.

09:47.516 --> 09:50.015
Oh! Have you ever
tried the fingerbutt?

09:50.099 --> 09:54.307
(dog whimpering)

09:54.391 --> 09:57.224
-It's okay, buddy.
-So, what now?

09:57.307 --> 09:59.557
I would want to get
him into surgery

09:59.641 --> 10:02.808
for a proper biopsy
of the mass, and then,

10:02.891 --> 10:07.182
depending on what we find,
there'd be another surgery
to remove the mass itself.

10:08.474 --> 10:09.724
(sniffles)

10:09.808 --> 10:13.224
Or you can take him
for a walk to the park,

10:13.307 --> 10:15.974
buy him a turkey sandwich,

10:16.057 --> 10:18.641
and then bring him
back and say goodbye.

10:18.724 --> 10:22.724
(sobbing)

10:27.641 --> 10:29.766
How much is
the surgery?

10:29.849 --> 10:33.516
(man singing melancholy song
in French)

10:44.391 --> 10:47.391
(gasps, pants)

10:51.808 --> 10:53.224
There you go.

10:53.307 --> 10:55.432
(sighing):
Oh, very good.

10:58.974 --> 11:00.432
(lighter flicks)

11:00.516 --> 11:02.808
Gene:
This other vet, he's like,
"What I would do is

11:02.891 --> 11:05.683
take pentobarbital
for large breeds."

11:05.766 --> 11:08.057
And I said, "Well,
what I would do is take

11:08.140 --> 11:10.557
"pentobarbital for large
breeds and small breeds,

11:10.641 --> 11:12.933
and I'm 140,
so I double it."

11:13.015 --> 11:15.391
I'd probably hop
a flight to Fiji.

11:15.474 --> 11:17.391
I'd want to be
on a beach.

11:19.391 --> 11:21.140
But that's,
that's just a hypothetical.

11:21.224 --> 11:23.891
I haven't really thought
about it, to be honest.

11:26.057 --> 11:30.140
Therapist: Wow.
This has escalated.

11:30.224 --> 11:31.724
What? How so?

11:31.808 --> 11:36.224
You just gave
a very detailed description
of your own suicide.

11:36.307 --> 11:39.349
Oh, sorry.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.307
Are you feeling
suicidal?

11:41.391 --> 11:42.599
No...

11:43.974 --> 11:44.974
No.

11:45.057 --> 11:46.557
Have you given
any further thought

11:46.641 --> 11:48.683
to trying
antidepressants?

11:48.766 --> 11:51.432
Yeah, I'm, uh,
still not feelin' it.

11:51.516 --> 11:53.849
-You're not
feelin' it?
-No.

11:53.933 --> 11:55.641
Are you still
using marijuana?

11:55.724 --> 11:56.933
Mm-hmm.

11:57.015 --> 11:59.182
-Daily?
-Pretty much.

11:59.265 --> 12:01.641
Nights, weekends.

12:04.432 --> 12:07.724
Just to offer
a professional
observation,

12:07.808 --> 12:09.182
I've noticed,
by and large,

12:09.265 --> 12:12.557
the people most resistant
to antidepressants

12:12.641 --> 12:15.641
are those most prone
to recreational drug use
and addiction.

12:15.724 --> 12:18.391
-Do you want me
to go on medication?
-Not if you don't.

12:18.474 --> 12:21.808
Just offering an observation
that might help you.

12:27.599 --> 12:30.015
Hey, um...

12:30.099 --> 12:34.182
Wh-- What do you think
about micro-dosing psychedelics?

12:34.265 --> 12:37.224
You know, for-- for depression.

12:37.307 --> 12:38.808
The Guy:
I mean, listen, man.

12:38.891 --> 12:41.182
Every time I take mushrooms,
I'm blissed out.

12:41.265 --> 12:43.391
-Huh. Okay.
-Almost every time.
But, yeah.

12:43.474 --> 12:45.015
So, how much
should I take?

12:45.099 --> 12:46.265
Uh, you know what?

12:46.349 --> 12:48.057
I don't know,
'cause I didn't make 'em.

12:48.140 --> 12:50.474
So you're gonna want
to just take a little bit.

12:50.557 --> 12:52.432
So like
a little nibble?

12:52.516 --> 12:54.683
Mm-mm,
like a nibble of a nibble.

12:54.766 --> 12:56.599
-Oh, wow.
-Micro.

12:56.683 --> 12:59.349
-Okay right. That's
why it's called-- Right.
-Micro-dosing.

13:34.182 --> 13:36.724
(dog barking)

13:47.140 --> 13:48.849
Does he know how to turn
his head and cough?

13:48.933 --> 13:50.224
Just joking.

13:50.307 --> 13:52.724
Oh, I think
he likes it!

13:52.808 --> 13:54.391
Me, too, buddy.
Me, too.

13:54.474 --> 13:58.265
What do you call
an elephant that
doesn't matter?

13:58.349 --> 14:00.182
An "irrelephant."

14:01.683 --> 14:03.015
-(barks)
-He's doing great!

14:03.099 --> 14:05.391
He just wants to play
a little more.

14:05.474 --> 14:08.808
Thank you for a great day,
everybody!

14:08.891 --> 14:10.766
Nice work!

14:12.891 --> 14:14.057
Okay.

14:32.766 --> 14:33.683
(dog barks)

14:33.766 --> 14:37.599
You get a treat,
and you get a treat!

14:37.683 --> 14:41.140
Don't think I forgot
about you, missy!

14:41.224 --> 14:42.599
Whoops.

14:42.683 --> 14:45.265
-Should have given
you a micro-dose.
-(cat meows)

14:45.349 --> 14:48.724
You know, your shell is
part of your skeleton,

14:48.808 --> 14:52.766
but it's also your home,
your safety zone.

14:52.849 --> 14:56.307
Which leads me to...
Just curious, how are
things at your home?

15:03.683 --> 15:05.057
Mmm!

15:05.140 --> 15:07.849
Gene (over-enunciating):
Neutered. Neu... tered.

15:07.933 --> 15:09.933
Neu-tered.

15:10.015 --> 15:12.224
Wow, I'm really good
at this weird thing,
aren't I?

15:12.307 --> 15:14.391
-I'm gonna be real
with you, Kadisha.
-Mm-hmm.

15:14.474 --> 15:15.849
Lucky's fucked.

15:15.933 --> 15:17.724
But I'll tell you,
with the Supreme Court

15:17.808 --> 15:19.891
and the world being
the way it is,

15:19.974 --> 15:21.391
it seems like
we're all fucked.

15:21.474 --> 15:23.974
So maybe you're
the lucky one.

15:24.057 --> 15:25.349
I love your eyes.

15:25.432 --> 15:31.182
Theresa, have I ever told you
how much I appreciate you?

15:31.265 --> 15:33.015
Thank you.

15:36.015 --> 15:37.849
(inhales)

15:37.933 --> 15:41.307
(sighing):
So much love.

15:41.391 --> 15:44.933
(laughing):
Okay, okay.

15:45.015 --> 15:48.015
Okay, okay.

15:52.015 --> 15:55.849
"Tolerance to mushrooms
builds quickly."

15:55.933 --> 15:57.933
"Using mushrooms
two days in a row

15:58.015 --> 16:00.516
may lead
to a diminished experience."

16:54.224 --> 16:56.349

is here.

16:56.432 --> 16:57.641
Okay, thank you.

16:57.724 --> 16:59.683
I'll be right there.

16:59.766 --> 17:01.432
Corrine:
Okay.

17:02.683 --> 17:04.182
Are you all right?

17:04.265 --> 17:07.808
Yeah, I'm feeling
a bit off. I'm fine.

17:09.057 --> 17:10.808
Okay.

17:24.391 --> 17:26.849
Whoa, that's
a lot of bags.

17:26.933 --> 17:29.182
Somebody had
a busy week.

17:29.265 --> 17:33.099
Yes, I, uh, took a lot
of lives last week.

17:33.182 --> 17:35.099
Hey, it keeps
the lights on.

17:35.182 --> 17:37.182
(high-pitched whining)

17:37.265 --> 17:39.057

18:53.683 --> 18:55.349
and then I went
to get food and--

18:55.432 --> 18:58.265
And then her kitten
fell into the tuba
and she got stuck.

18:58.349 --> 19:00.224
-We can't get her out.
-Can-- Can you get a vet?

19:00.307 --> 19:02.641

The vet's on his way out.
I mean, I don't know--

19:02.724 --> 19:05.057

Hold on. Hold on.

19:07.057 --> 19:08.516

try something.

-Yeah.

19:52.099 --> 19:54.474
Oh, sorry.

19:54.557 --> 19:58.099
One, two, three.

19:59.391 --> 20:00.516

20:10.265 --> 20:12.849
Okay, that's
the first step.

it's working.

-Well, that's good!
-Yeah, it's good.

to the medication.

Much better. I've--
I've been thinking

that's great.
-It is.

No, yeah. It's good.
