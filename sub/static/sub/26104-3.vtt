Previously on "Mayans M.C."

00:05.339 --> 00:07.175
NESTOR: This was posted
40 minutes ago.

00:07.208 --> 00:09.110
It's already gone viral.

00:18.052 --> 00:22.256
Los Olvidados
kidnapped my son.

00:24.758 --> 00:26.594
Stop!

00:26.627 --> 00:28.829
ANGEL: My brother,
he knows Galindo's wife.

00:28.862 --> 00:30.664
They were together
before he went to prison.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.567
EMILY: Miguel promised
there would be no retaliation

00:33.601 --> 00:36.170
but if anything happens,
will you tell me?

00:36.204 --> 00:37.371
It already has.

00:37.405 --> 00:39.173
Two innocents burned to death.

00:39.207 --> 00:40.908
Dumped in merchant square.

00:40.941 --> 00:42.776
Oh, Jesus.

01:52.713 --> 01:54.315
Vamos!

01:54.348 --> 01:55.316
MINI: Rapido, rapido!

01:55.349 --> 01:57.251
CARLA:

01:57.285 --> 01:58.519
Vamos!

01:58.552 --> 02:00.454
CARLA:

02:17.205 --> 02:18.872
Vamos. Rapido, rapido.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.674
GIRL: Vámanos, vámanos.

02:30.318 --> 02:34.154
*

02:52.172 --> 02:53.407
NESTOR: Motherfuckers.

02:53.441 --> 03:00.414
*

03:17.865 --> 03:19.166
There's no signal out there.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.734
We tried to give you
a heads up.

03:20.768 --> 03:23.771
I know. We'll give you
our satellite number.

03:55.736 --> 03:58.772
Something you gotta hear.

04:00.508 --> 04:02.242
I got him.

04:11.485 --> 04:13.754
We may have locked
down a buyer.

04:13.787 --> 04:15.556
Out of Nevada.

04:15.589 --> 04:16.757
Jimmy Yen.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.459
He's setting up his own thing.

04:18.492 --> 04:19.993
Needs product.

04:20.027 --> 04:21.829
When will you be certain?

04:21.862 --> 04:24.598
Probably make
a run to Vegas next week.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.166
We're gonna have to.

04:29.337 --> 04:30.938
Okay.

04:30.971 --> 04:32.906
We're running out of time
and places to hide.

04:32.940 --> 04:34.775
I know.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.745
I'm sure he's gonna want
all nine keys you got left.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.179
Tell him we have six.

04:39.212 --> 04:40.247
COCO: Why?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.415
Six?

04:41.449 --> 04:43.751
You run out of firewood again?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.359
He needs his mother.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.061
He needs a clean diaper.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.966
Thought this was about
creating less orphans.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.662
What was that about?

05:28.696 --> 05:30.030
Kid needs a change.

05:36.670 --> 05:42.776
*

05:44.412 --> 05:47.681
* Mother of exiles

05:47.715 --> 05:50.818
* The torch of hope

05:50.851 --> 05:52.386
* In the toss of the tempest

05:52.420 --> 05:55.255
* Threw us medicine's rope

05:55.288 --> 05:59.226
* But the brazen giant

05:59.259 --> 06:01.429
* With limbs astride

06:01.462 --> 06:04.164
* Blocks the golden door

06:04.197 --> 06:06.667
* To the US of lies

06:06.700 --> 06:08.035
* Screaming

06:08.068 --> 06:11.505
* Damn your huddled masses

06:11.539 --> 06:14.842
* Scrub our floors

06:14.875 --> 06:17.511
* Cut our grasses

06:17.545 --> 06:20.080
* I am a wolf

06:20.113 --> 06:22.950
* A wild cur

06:22.983 --> 06:26.053
* Cut from the pack

06:26.086 --> 06:28.789
* With blood on my fur

06:28.822 --> 06:31.425
* And every howl

06:31.459 --> 06:34.227
* Marks the dead

06:34.261 --> 06:37.798
* 'Cause a beaten dog

06:37.831 --> 06:39.433
*

06:39.467 --> 06:41.635
* Never forgets

06:41.669 --> 06:44.872
*

06:44.905 --> 06:47.374
* Never forgets

06:47.407 --> 06:53.280
*

07:12.265 --> 07:15.102
Our associates at the CDCR
have reached out.

07:15.135 --> 07:18.639
That rebel video has made
people very nervous.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.674
We're gonna meet with them
this afternoon.

07:20.708 --> 07:22.275
Calm shit down.

07:22.309 --> 07:25.245
Let 'em know it's gonna be
business as usual.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.247
They just want to know we're
telling them the truth.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.582
That we'll have
their own to deliver

07:28.616 --> 07:30.484
at the end of the month.

07:30.518 --> 07:34.822
Well, I have more poppies
than I can harvest.

07:34.855 --> 07:37.257
You'll have your product.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.159
Thank you.

07:44.297 --> 07:45.666
Where are you meeting them?

07:47.501 --> 07:50.638
Outside Cibola.

07:50.671 --> 07:52.205
San Buho Casino.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.067
The tip was good.

08:20.100 --> 08:22.135
But...

08:22.169 --> 08:24.337
we were too late, Mikey.
I'm sorry.

08:24.371 --> 08:27.174
The rebels already moved.

08:27.207 --> 08:28.542
Was there anything
at the camp?

08:42.790 --> 08:44.558
There's another video.

08:47.761 --> 08:50.731
I want my pew
full by end of day.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.934
DEVANTE:
They want us to handle it.

08:53.967 --> 08:56.369
I'm hoping you can.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.038
BISHOP:
Okay, so let me be clear.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.506
This all came down
from old man Chen?

08:59.539 --> 09:01.909
Yes.
Two days ago.

09:01.942 --> 09:06.213
And Miguel is good
with the terms.

09:06.246 --> 09:08.515
It's the Chinese whose
shipment got jacked.

09:08.548 --> 09:11.451
Makes sense that we proxy
the cartel message.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.520
Let them know
everything's cool.

09:13.553 --> 09:15.756
Chinese supply the southern
parole region

09:15.789 --> 09:17.390
with hashish and horse.

09:17.424 --> 09:20.293
Chen's guys most likely know
our prison suits.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.735
Yeah.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.803
All right. Set it up.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.304
I'll make sure
we're up there by 3:00.

09:31.338 --> 09:34.407
Good.
I'll call you to confirm.

10:18.518 --> 10:22.790
Keep this between us
until I get confirmation, huh?

10:22.823 --> 10:25.225
Yeah, of course.

10:26.960 --> 10:28.929
MAN:
We took a stand against evil

10:28.962 --> 10:31.131
and this was the response.

10:31.164 --> 10:34.467
The devil is desperate,
so he tries to silence us.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.537
He wants us to crawl back
into our dirty little holes

10:37.570 --> 10:39.139
and be terrified.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.640
But there is no place
left to hide.

10:40.674 --> 10:41.775
No safe holes.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.310
Our mothers and fathers,

10:43.343 --> 10:45.212
our sons and daughters,

10:45.245 --> 10:47.815
the cartel will make
orphans of us all

10:47.848 --> 10:50.450
unless we make a stand
for our children

10:50.483 --> 10:53.787
and our children's' children.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.924
We can no longer be forgotten.

11:26.019 --> 11:32.692
*

11:40.600 --> 11:42.936
-Gracias.
-Mm-hmm, bien. Lunch.

12:03.924 --> 12:05.759
Crazy fucking times.

12:07.494 --> 12:09.963
It's too early for a drop.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.801
Just checking in.

12:14.935 --> 12:18.705
A lot's going on on
the other side of the fence.

12:18.738 --> 12:21.141
I want to make sure
our boy's doing okay.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.811
I know it's a rough day.

12:25.345 --> 12:26.446
He's fine.

12:27.948 --> 12:29.282
WOMAN: Hola, Felipe.

12:35.622 --> 12:36.689
Good.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.660
I'll stop worrying.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.497
You contact them.

12:45.933 --> 12:47.667
You can call 24/7.

12:52.973 --> 12:54.607
Tell him to use it.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.110
Soon.

13:31.578 --> 13:37.584
*

13:45.192 --> 13:46.693
-Yeah.

13:46.726 --> 13:48.728
Whores are taking good
care of him.

13:48.761 --> 13:50.297
Everything good with Adelita?

13:50.330 --> 13:51.564
ANGEL:
Yeah, we'll set it up.

13:51.598 --> 13:52.665
What are you doing here?

13:52.699 --> 13:54.134
Come to get you.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.636
The run got pushed up.
Leaving earlier.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.670
Not sure why.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.907
ANGEL:
Okay.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.043
Let Bishop know
we were checking on Creep.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.511
We'll catch up.

14:04.544 --> 14:06.379
Prospect.
He's riding with us, right?

14:07.948 --> 14:09.749
Go.

14:15.288 --> 14:16.256
Look.

14:18.691 --> 14:22.595
I know this thing with Emily's
kid's gotta be hard for you.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.697
ANGEL: Of course it is.

14:24.731 --> 14:26.599
But you can't let it bleed
into what we're doing.

14:35.208 --> 14:36.476
Sorry.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.649
Strange day, you know?

14:46.653 --> 14:49.589
ANGEL: Shit, I'm sorry man.
I forgot.

14:49.622 --> 14:50.958
Doesn't matter.

15:18.818 --> 15:25.558
*

15:30.964 --> 15:32.499
MAN: Drop it!

15:38.438 --> 15:40.373
ANGEL: I didn't think.

15:42.642 --> 15:44.544
Mayans so far up my ass.

15:48.315 --> 15:50.383
It's okay.

17:07.594 --> 17:09.162
Los Americanos, fuck you!

18:21.501 --> 18:22.502
How's Creep?

18:22.535 --> 18:24.171
He's healing up.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.672
Dump that pure 12 scrap?

18:25.705 --> 18:28.175
Hell, no.
That drop is over six tons.

18:28.208 --> 18:30.643
Bishop wants to
hit the road early.

18:30.677 --> 18:32.645
I guess Galindo
invited the Chinese

18:32.679 --> 18:34.013
to our prison sit-down.

18:36.216 --> 18:37.850
Same shit.

18:37.884 --> 18:40.653
Let them know the cartel
will be able to deliver.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.456
That makes it easy.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.624
Hey, buy me a few minutes?

18:44.657 --> 18:46.193
-Yeah.
-Gonna give Jimmy a call.

18:56.336 --> 18:57.504
Vamos.

19:07.079 --> 19:09.048
(Santa Esmeralda's "Don't
Let Me Be Misunderstood")

19:09.081 --> 19:15.888
*

19:48.355 --> 19:55.362
*

19:58.365 --> 19:59.599
My brown brothers.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.101
Adam.
-Bishop.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.575
Hey, sorry about
checking the weapons.

20:08.608 --> 20:10.277
It's tribal law.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.245
Booze and bullets have not
been a good combination

20:12.279 --> 20:13.413
for my people.

20:13.446 --> 20:15.282
Ours either.

20:15.315 --> 20:16.616
The other parties
get down here yet?

20:16.649 --> 20:18.017
ADAM: Not that I know of.

20:18.050 --> 20:19.386
But we have the room
you requested.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.921
It's private, very quiet.

20:21.954 --> 20:23.256
Thank you.

20:29.762 --> 20:32.064
Well, we've got
a few hours to kill.

20:32.098 --> 20:34.066
Me and the Boy Scout.

20:34.100 --> 20:36.336
We're gonna win
a little wampum.

20:37.670 --> 20:38.805
Keep him contained.

20:43.310 --> 20:44.311
-I'll catch up.
-Yeah.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.156
How you been, Jimmy?

20:58.758 --> 21:01.328
Getting by.

21:01.361 --> 21:03.830
What do you have?

21:03.863 --> 21:05.432
Six keys.

21:05.465 --> 21:08.167
97% pure Guero heroin.

21:08.200 --> 21:09.869
30 per brick.

21:12.038 --> 21:15.508
-Thought you had nine.
-So did I.

21:15.542 --> 21:17.043
I'm just the middle man.

21:19.045 --> 21:21.147
Can you get it to Vegas?

21:21.180 --> 21:22.649
Yeah.

21:23.650 --> 21:26.285
You certain it stays
outside the family?

21:26.319 --> 21:27.587
Yep.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.821
You?

21:29.789 --> 21:31.858
Mm. Same.

21:34.327 --> 21:35.795
I'm in.

21:36.062 --> 21:37.029
Okay.

21:42.001 --> 21:49.008
*

22:32.118 --> 22:33.453
Place all bets.

22:42.862 --> 22:43.830
WOMAN: Stay.

22:43.863 --> 22:44.864
And you, sir?

22:46.032 --> 22:47.199
21.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.705
The house is over.

22:52.739 --> 22:54.206
The gentleman wins again.

23:01.448 --> 23:02.582
Jimmy?

23:02.615 --> 23:04.651
All good.
I'll fill you in.

23:06.819 --> 23:08.421
He's got him counting cards?

23:08.455 --> 23:09.789
Yup.

23:14.927 --> 23:17.129
Take a break.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.164
Thank you.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.811
MAN: Ma'am?

23:31.844 --> 23:33.746
WOMAN: Double down.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.548
I'm--I'm just trying to
make me some money, man.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.283
You know me, I'm a giver.

23:38.317 --> 23:39.752
Yeah, you're a fucking saint.

23:39.786 --> 23:41.454
MAN: Are you in, sir?

23:41.488 --> 23:42.522
Cash him out.

23:58.337 --> 23:59.772
KROLL: Mayans?

23:59.806 --> 24:01.440
That your badass gang?

24:02.008 --> 24:03.943
Just a motorcycle club, man.

24:03.976 --> 24:05.244
WOMAN: What can I get you?

24:05.277 --> 24:06.679
Whatever light
you got on tap.

24:06.713 --> 24:08.347
Miller?

24:08.380 --> 24:10.950
MAN: "Prospect" must be
Spanish for "bitch."

24:31.337 --> 24:33.706
You got something to say,
La Bamba?

24:33.740 --> 24:35.775
Say it in fucking English.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.644
Just asking what tables
were lucky.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.980
You officers have a good day.

24:44.851 --> 24:46.152
Pussy gangster.

24:53.359 --> 24:55.494
Yeah, you better walk away.

25:21.921 --> 25:23.189
Tea?

25:23.856 --> 25:25.124
Gracias.

25:35.434 --> 25:37.570
DITA: I sent Thiago
to the Apple store.

25:39.238 --> 25:40.740
Get you a new phone.

25:43.242 --> 25:44.711
I have to go there.

25:46.412 --> 25:48.380
The square in the video.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.918
-He was there.

25:51.951 --> 25:54.053
-Today.
-You don't know that.

25:54.086 --> 25:55.554
You're right.
I don't know anything.

25:55.588 --> 25:57.089
That's the problem.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.795
I have to do something.

26:02.829 --> 26:05.732
Miguel would never allow you
to go to Santa Madre.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.902
Not now.

26:09.936 --> 26:11.604
What would you do?

26:13.940 --> 26:15.742
If it was your son?

26:20.680 --> 26:22.615
-I would support my husband.
-No.

26:22.649 --> 26:24.216
That's what you have to do.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.685
What would you want to do?

26:27.854 --> 26:29.656
I know you well enough, Dita.

26:29.689 --> 26:31.824
A still tongue and idle hands

26:31.858 --> 26:34.460
aren't strategies in
your maternal handbook.

26:40.132 --> 26:42.268
If anybody recognized you...

26:42.301 --> 26:43.369
They won't.

27:10.062 --> 27:17.069
*

27:18.537 --> 27:20.306
NESTOR:

27:20.339 --> 27:21.708
MIGUEL: I should do it.

27:24.576 --> 27:26.012
You sure?

27:27.747 --> 27:28.881
Yeah.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.335
Bara.

28:18.197 --> 28:24.570
*

29:11.951 --> 29:18.958
*

29:38.177 --> 29:39.178
That was impressive.

29:41.447 --> 29:45.818
I think it was
a combination of omertà

29:45.852 --> 29:47.786
and the Boy Scout oath.

29:47.820 --> 29:49.321
It worked.

29:50.622 --> 29:52.959
How many spies are we
putting on the street?

29:52.992 --> 29:55.161
This group, it'll be
an even dozen.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.264
Careful with that shit
on your face.

29:58.297 --> 30:00.066
These little fuckers are
oozing with disease.

30:03.535 --> 30:04.570
Great.

30:12.411 --> 30:14.113
Good teamwork, Boy Scout.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.883
That better be a 50/50 split.

30:16.916 --> 30:19.952
-My bad.

30:19.986 --> 30:21.320
Here you go.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.026
Those our prison hookups?

30:27.059 --> 30:29.661
ANGEL: Yeah. Maintenance
and supply managers.

30:29.695 --> 30:31.230
North and south.

30:31.263 --> 30:35.001
Some of California's
finest civil servants.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.402
Those greedy fucks
control everything

30:36.435 --> 30:38.670
coming and going
from 26 prisons.

30:48.580 --> 30:50.349
All right, you're all set,
gentlemen.

30:50.382 --> 30:54.320
The single malt you requested
is in the back cabinet.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.287
Enjoy.

30:56.388 --> 30:57.356
Thank you.

30:58.257 --> 30:59.758
-Bishop.
-Chen.

31:01.427 --> 31:02.895
HANK: Jimmy.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.167
I think you gentlemen
know each other?

31:08.200 --> 31:09.801
Always a pleasure.

31:28.420 --> 31:35.427
*

32:38.991 --> 32:40.526
Hola.

32:58.377 --> 33:00.346
Did you know
he would retaliate?

33:01.547 --> 33:03.615
It wasn't my son.
It was Devante.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.751
Yes, but Miguel
put it in motion.

33:09.521 --> 33:10.956
He lied to me.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.991
No.
You're a smart girl, Emily.

33:13.025 --> 33:14.926
You know it's not that simple.

33:16.028 --> 33:19.065
Miguel made a choice
to come back to the family.

33:19.098 --> 33:22.668
His father and I wanted
a different life for him.

33:22.701 --> 33:25.704
That's why we sent him
to school in America.

33:25.737 --> 33:28.507
Hoping the distance
would settle and change him.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.676
It didn't.
You know that.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.011
And he wants to change
the legacy.

33:33.045 --> 33:35.147
Rewrite family history like

33:35.181 --> 33:36.782
John and Bobby did for Joe.

33:38.517 --> 33:40.252
Although the Kennedy model
may not be the best way

33:40.286 --> 33:41.353
to secure a future.

33:52.131 --> 33:53.599
Sorry.

34:04.443 --> 34:06.312
I'm sorry, this was stupid.
I don't...

34:08.314 --> 34:09.648
I don't know what
I thought I'd find.

34:12.584 --> 34:14.153
+You did what a mother does.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.323
Followed your instincts.

34:18.657 --> 34:20.992
Sometimes that's all we have.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.143
Look.

34:37.176 --> 34:38.944
We're not privy

34:38.977 --> 34:41.313
to everything that's happening
with the rebels, but

34:41.347 --> 34:43.482
this kind of shit
is the cost of doing business

34:43.515 --> 34:44.916
for the cartel.

34:44.950 --> 34:46.752
It always has been.

34:46.785 --> 34:49.821
2010, we saw the same thing
happen to Galindo's old man.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.758
Lobos Sonora made a play
for the border,

34:52.791 --> 34:54.993
shipments were being clipped
every week.

34:55.026 --> 34:57.028
Our business didn't change.

34:59.798 --> 35:02.134
I'll be honest
with you, Marcus.

35:02.168 --> 35:05.671
We have a lot of people
rattling our cage,

35:05.704 --> 35:09.007
saying this is their chance
to take over the H trade.

35:09.040 --> 35:11.109
I'm guessing the rattling
might quiet down a bit

35:11.143 --> 35:12.378
if we bumped up your cut.

35:15.281 --> 35:17.483
That would send
the right message.

35:18.550 --> 35:21.653
YONG: We know Galindo's
got plenty of product.

35:21.687 --> 35:24.190
We're not worried
about the merchandise.

35:24.223 --> 35:25.791
We're worried about
the shipping.

35:31.363 --> 35:34.300
These assholes caught us
off guard.

35:34.333 --> 35:36.134
That's on us.

35:36.168 --> 35:38.804
But you've got my word
it won't fucking happen again.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.308
Your shipment'll be on time.

35:42.341 --> 35:44.610
Same volume. Same dates.

35:44.643 --> 35:47.078
And we'll bump your rate 2%.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.885
And you'll get your 12 keys
by the end of next week.

35:54.820 --> 35:55.754
Mm.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.214
GABE: Bishop.

36:57.115 --> 36:58.116
LENNY: Thanks.

37:04.756 --> 37:07.626
Did I hear the Chief mention
something about a single malt?

37:07.659 --> 37:08.727
Yes, you did.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.065
Behind you, kid.
In the cabinet.

37:19.104 --> 37:25.777
*

37:25.811 --> 37:27.313
YONG: Only the best.
-Nice.

37:30.015 --> 37:31.283
RIZ: Come on, brother.

37:31.317 --> 37:32.518
Pour.

37:37.689 --> 37:38.657
BISHOP: Of course.

37:48.867 --> 37:50.902
A toast.

37:50.936 --> 37:52.838
To new allies,

37:52.871 --> 37:55.441
and dead traitors.

37:55.474 --> 37:56.808
-Jesus!
-Holy shit!

38:07.553 --> 38:08.987
TAZA: Old man Chen found out

38:09.020 --> 38:10.489
about Jimmy
running his own drug gang.

38:10.522 --> 38:12.257
Broke the cardinal rule.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.192
Didn't cut the family in

38:14.225 --> 38:16.261
or kick anything up.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.597
The Chinese couldn't kill
one of their own.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.866
So Chen reached out to Galindo.

38:20.899 --> 38:23.769
HANK: Galindo gave it to us.

38:23.802 --> 38:25.036
Why the fuck didn't we know?

38:25.070 --> 38:27.305
It wasn't a done deal.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.675
Chen asking about the scotch.

38:29.708 --> 38:31.477
That was the confirmation.

38:31.510 --> 38:35.481
And besides,
the look on your faces.

38:35.514 --> 38:37.182
So fucking worth it.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.468
Hey, Prez.

40:46.444 --> 40:48.647
Prospect.

40:48.680 --> 40:50.381
You got unfinished business.

40:57.823 --> 40:59.658
He's a cop.

40:59.691 --> 41:01.192
BISHOP: Not in here he ain't.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.194
Tribal ground.

41:20.546 --> 41:22.413
Buy yourself
some fucking manners.

41:26.885 --> 41:27.986
WOMAN:
WOMAN: Oh, my God.

41:30.355 --> 41:31.557
I'm a cop.

41:37.596 --> 41:38.897
I'm a cop.

41:41.900 --> 41:43.001
MAN: What the fuck?

41:44.736 --> 41:45.737
The hell are you doing?

41:52.878 --> 41:54.913
MAN: Come on,
let's get out of here.

41:56.882 --> 41:58.449
MAN: They're not worth it.

42:58.644 --> 43:00.145
Jesus.

43:00.178 --> 43:02.080
Who the hell are you?

43:02.113 --> 43:03.982
I'm going for my ID.

43:16.194 --> 43:18.830
"Santiago Martin Himmler."

43:19.998 --> 43:22.634
Himmler?
Really?

43:24.135 --> 43:27.172
Your Argentinian grandmother
fuck a Nazi?

43:28.173 --> 43:30.008
Something like that.

43:30.776 --> 43:33.444
Jimenez send you down here?

43:33.478 --> 43:34.913
Get the gun
out of my face, please.

43:34.946 --> 43:36.447
Answer the question

43:36.481 --> 43:38.183
or it's gonna be down
your fucking throat.

43:39.651 --> 43:41.086
Yeah.

43:41.119 --> 43:42.921
I'm working with Jimenez.

43:42.954 --> 43:45.523
What the hell is wrong
with you guys?

43:45.556 --> 43:48.193
My son's kept up
his end of the deal.

43:48.226 --> 43:50.862
Doing everything he's told.

43:50.896 --> 43:52.463
You guys keep
crawling up his ass,

43:52.497 --> 43:54.933
you're gonna get him killed.

43:54.966 --> 43:57.135
This isn't just about
your son.

43:57.168 --> 43:59.938
Galindo's moving a shit-dump
of men and money to the border

43:59.971 --> 44:01.973
like he's prepping for war.

44:03.174 --> 44:05.877
Jimenez is worried about
retaliation.

44:05.911 --> 44:08.313
Just wants a set of eyes
on you.

44:08.346 --> 44:09.347
Till it settles.

44:21.392 --> 44:24.062
I don't need a babysitter.

44:26.998 --> 44:28.333
Yeah, I get that.

44:49.187 --> 44:54.092
*

44:54.125 --> 44:56.928
MAN: The first major battle
between US ground troops

44:56.962 --> 45:00.265
and the North Vietnamese
was in Ia Drang

45:00.298 --> 45:04.602
between November 14th
and 18th in 1965,

45:04.635 --> 45:07.438
at LZ X-Ray and LZ Albany.

45:07.472 --> 45:10.341
It is known as the
first helicopter air assault--

45:10.375 --> 45:12.377
(man on TV continues
speaking indistinctly)

45:22.921 --> 45:23.955
EZ: Hey, Pop. You up?

45:25.290 --> 45:26.291
FELIPE: Yeah.

45:37.568 --> 45:40.405
MAN: This battle
would set the mold

45:40.438 --> 45:42.774
for the preferred
methods of engagement...

45:56.154 --> 45:57.255
Want a beer?

46:00.325 --> 46:01.359
Sure.

46:16.041 --> 46:17.475
Thank you.

46:28.553 --> 46:30.288
Get through it all right?

46:35.326 --> 46:36.361
Yeah.

46:38.196 --> 46:39.530
Like we do.

47:15.700 --> 47:17.435
I know where you went today.

47:19.070 --> 47:21.539
Then you know why
I had to go.

47:47.032 --> 47:48.433
I'm so sorry.

48:00.912 --> 48:02.914
RIZ: Like tequila, huh?
WOMAN: Mm-hmm.

48:02.948 --> 48:04.182
RIZ: That's a lot of
drinking, woman.

48:04.215 --> 48:06.284
HANK: Goes something like this.

48:07.752 --> 48:09.754
What do you think?

48:09.787 --> 48:11.756
Right here?

48:11.789 --> 48:14.092
DEVANTE: I will pass that
along to Miguel, my friend.

48:14.125 --> 48:15.560
You take care.

48:20.966 --> 48:22.433
Devante.

48:22.467 --> 48:23.801
All good.

48:23.834 --> 48:25.971
Handling the hit,

48:26.004 --> 48:28.773
our help with the rebels,

48:28.806 --> 48:30.808
our debt from the heist
is cleared.

48:30.841 --> 48:33.411
Our bullshit debt.

48:33.444 --> 48:35.913
Until things settle on
the south side of the fence,

48:35.947 --> 48:38.749
it's on us to keep this side
moving forward.

48:38.783 --> 48:39.917
Bullshit or not.

48:44.489 --> 48:46.424
Why didn't you want me
telling the rest of my charter

48:46.457 --> 48:48.126
about the Chinese hit?

48:49.494 --> 48:51.162
We never found out how

48:51.196 --> 48:54.465
the Samoans knew all
the details to our Vegas run.

48:54.499 --> 48:57.935
Galindo's too distracted
to press it,

48:57.969 --> 48:59.437
but I'm still aware.

49:02.473 --> 49:04.142
Someone in the MC?

49:07.979 --> 49:09.380
I don't know.

49:20.825 --> 49:22.060
Hey, Pop.

49:24.462 --> 49:26.031
You need me?

49:27.865 --> 49:30.468
Just want to check in
on this one.

49:30.501 --> 49:32.803
Make sure he didn't stroke out.

49:32.837 --> 49:34.605
Hm.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.874
Your compassion overwhelms me.

49:45.050 --> 49:47.218
You guys got anything to eat?

49:47.252 --> 49:48.553
I'm fucking starving.

49:52.190 --> 49:53.191
Mm.

50:42.207 --> 50:44.309
MAN: And no problems
with the M-16.
