00:06.610 --> 00:10.000
- Ladies, do you find
Miss Witham to be one of you?

00:10.050 --> 00:13.611
- Is this your security report?
Kate, you need this to work!

00:13.660 --> 00:16.709
- It's not real.
Kate Andrews doesn't exist.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.355
- [Marco]: It's no joke,
what happened to her.

00:19.410 --> 00:21.355
- Maybe now she'll
let me take her out.

00:23.670 --> 00:26.230
- We built a bad bomb, girls.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.885
- Hey, your face,
it's not so bad.

00:28.940 --> 00:31.363
It looks like she made out
with a cheese grater.

00:32.940 --> 00:35.067
- Men like Marco
should not be working

00:35.120 --> 00:36.200
at the factory.

00:36.250 --> 00:38.115
It's a disaster
waiting to happen.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.628
- [Bob]: Well then,
you'll get him out.

00:40.690 --> 00:42.032
- I will.

00:42.080 --> 00:44.036
I just gotta
figure out how.

00:47.350 --> 00:48.908
- [Gladys]: Says right here:

00:48.960 --> 00:51.565
"Germans slip a noose
around Leningrad."

00:51.610 --> 00:53.396
Can you imagine?

00:53.440 --> 00:55.522
- They're facing
a long, tough winter.

00:55.570 --> 00:57.094
- Russians are resilient.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.005
Have you watched
The Scarlet Empress?

00:59.050 --> 01:01.268
I bet they'll
plant victory gardens

01:01.320 --> 01:03.538
out front of
the Winter Palace.

01:03.580 --> 01:05.662
- Yeah, 'cause the rich
just love to share.

01:05.710 --> 01:07.359
- In troubled times,
we're the same.

01:07.410 --> 01:08.889
- Last puffs!
Minutes to shift.

01:08.930 --> 01:10.932
- I'd give them
more credit.

01:10.980 --> 01:14.234
- You haven't spent the winter
in a small house with 6 people.

01:14.290 --> 01:18.158
Come spring, the Ruskies will
be throttling each other.

01:18.200 --> 01:19.189
- No metal.

01:19.250 --> 01:21.241
Make sure that goes
in your locker.

01:21.290 --> 01:23.167
- What do you think,
Mr. Moretti?

01:23.210 --> 01:24.290
- About what?

01:24.340 --> 01:25.682
- The Russians
under Siege!

01:25.730 --> 01:28.290
Can they keep the line,
pull together?

01:28.340 --> 01:31.514
- Well, no point speculating.
People always surprise you.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.642
- I don't see why
we'd feel sorry for Russia.

01:33.700 --> 01:35.918
- Of course you wouldn't.

01:35.960 --> 01:39.214
- They were Hitler's allies
only a few months ago.

01:39.270 --> 01:41.522
But your people know
all about changing sides.

01:41.570 --> 01:42.832
- My people?

01:42.880 --> 01:44.654
- That an Italian
newspaper you've got?

01:44.710 --> 01:46.837
- You know,
I take it back, Lorna.

01:46.880 --> 01:49.314
You're one person who
never surprises.

01:49.370 --> 01:51.406
[Buzzer sounds]

01:55.890 --> 01:57.676
- They're bringing in who?

01:57.720 --> 01:59.233
Good God...

02:01.290 --> 02:03.542
Management's arriving
for a spot inspection

02:03.600 --> 02:05.636
and they brought the colonel!

02:16.830 --> 02:19.867
The Department of Defence knows
all about our little hiccup

02:19.920 --> 02:21.569
with the 25-pounders,

02:21.610 --> 02:24.090
which means th_e_own_er's
got us on the fIrIng line

02:24.140 --> 02:25.482
to prove we're up to snuff.

02:25.530 --> 02:26.610
- What's going on?

02:26.660 --> 02:28.002
- Inspection.

02:28.060 --> 02:30.221
Every line gets them.
You never know when.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.623
- No errors today.
Make sure of it, Mrs. Corbett.

02:32.670 --> 02:34.922
-Yes, sir! We know how
to toe the line.

02:34.980 --> 02:36.186
Don't we, girls?

02:36.240 --> 02:37.935
- Will they check
our papers?

02:37.980 --> 02:40.016
- Not if you don't
give them reason.

02:40.070 --> 02:42.937
- The military being here
doesn't make it any different.

02:42.980 --> 02:44.766
Don't forget,
these inspectors,

02:44.810 --> 02:46.198
they're on our side.

02:49.210 --> 02:50.427
Hmm...

02:50.470 --> 02:51.983
[Buzzer sounds]

03:00.090 --> 03:01.990
- [Man]: I'll take
this line here.

03:12.750 --> 03:16.277
- [Kate]: Will they
check our lockers?

03:16.320 --> 03:18.140
- Don't worry, Kate.

03:18.190 --> 03:20.146
It's the same drill
Lorna gives us.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.714
Checking for stray
metal, maybe a tack.

03:22.760 --> 03:27.242
- Easy, fella. I already
got a date for Saturday.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.848
[Sighs]

03:48.880 --> 03:51.303
- Sorry to have kept you
waiting. Come right in.

03:51.360 --> 03:54.488
I trust you'll check
the men's lockers as well.

03:57.450 --> 04:00.146
Careless, Miss Andrews.

04:02.450 --> 04:03.849
"Marion"?

04:09.110 --> 04:11.328
- Morning! How is the patient?

04:11.380 --> 04:13.894
- She'd crack you
a big old smile,

04:13.940 --> 04:16.158
except her face might
split down the middle.

04:20.340 --> 04:22.900
I really could
use a bandage, Sheila.

04:22.950 --> 04:24.679
- It needs the
open aIr to heal.

04:24.740 --> 04:27.083
- You know, I'd kill for
a decent night's sleep.

04:27.130 --> 04:28.734
- Don't you get
a pill at night?

04:28.790 --> 04:30.473
- Doesn't do the trick.

04:30.530 --> 04:33.169
- I'll mention it to the doctor.
- Would you?

04:33.220 --> 04:35.745
Hey, that'd be grand.

04:35.790 --> 04:38.315
- The girls from
Victory Munitions

04:38.360 --> 04:40.408
sent over another package.

04:40.450 --> 04:41.883
- Any cigarettes?

04:41.930 --> 04:43.659
- Um, I don't think so.

04:43.710 --> 04:45.712
- Hey, um...

04:45.760 --> 04:48.103
Can you get me a pack
next time you're out?

04:49.630 --> 04:50.801
- Wounds need air, Vera,

04:50.850 --> 04:52.898
and so do patients.

04:52.940 --> 04:54.840
You can't hide in here forever.

05:02.860 --> 05:04.680
- So we're all clear here?

05:04.730 --> 05:06.288
You boys find anything?

05:06.340 --> 05:08.683
- [Man 1]: We'rejust
inspectors, ma'am.

05:08.740 --> 05:11.345
- [Man 2]: You wanna go digging,
talk to the major.

05:11.390 --> 05:12.948
- Mrs. Corbett...

05:13.000 --> 05:15.696
You wanted to see me?

05:15.750 --> 05:18.787
- Oh, I found this locket
on the clean side,

05:18.840 --> 05:20.353
not where it should
have been.

05:20.400 --> 05:21.708
- Oh, I'm sorry.

05:21.750 --> 05:24.275
- It says "Marion."

05:24.320 --> 05:28.495
- I found it on the street.
I thought it was pretty.

05:28.540 --> 05:30.451
- Mrs. Corbett?

05:30.500 --> 05:31.626
I hate to make trouble,

05:31.670 --> 05:33.410
but I believe one of
the inspectors

05:33.460 --> 05:35.018
stole something
from my locker.

05:35.070 --> 05:36.628
My perfume,
Fleurs de Rocaille.

05:36.680 --> 05:37.977
My fianc gave it to me.

05:38.030 --> 05:40.157
I'm sure you know
what it costs these days

05:40.200 --> 05:41.986
to get a luxury
like that out of Paris.

05:42.030 --> 05:43.816
- Where's the sense,
bringing it here?

05:43.860 --> 05:46.328
- A sense of smell,
I suppose.

05:46.380 --> 05:49.258
How else does a girl
cope with the cordite?

05:49.300 --> 05:51.860
- Perhaps we should look
in Miss Andrews' locker.

05:51.910 --> 05:53.639
- I d-- I didn't take it.

05:53.700 --> 05:55.782
- You say you
found this locket,

05:55.830 --> 05:57.650
but maybe you stole it.

05:57.700 --> 06:00.168
And now, with an expensive
perfume missing...

06:00.220 --> 06:03.223
- Surely one of the inspectors
took it, likely for his girl.

06:03.270 --> 06:05.226
- I was there with
the Inspectors.

06:05.270 --> 06:08.398
- Mrs. Corbett,
that's not a stolen locket.

06:08.450 --> 06:11.669
- Then you have nothing
to worry about, do you?

06:14.670 --> 06:17.412
_ We're under _
a microscope here, girls.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.849
- I told you!
It wasn't Kate.

06:22.070 --> 06:24.288
- Since Miss Witham
was a victim of theft,

06:24.340 --> 06:26.069
my only choice is to
clock the cost of

06:26.120 --> 06:27.940
the perfume from each
girl's paycheque.

06:27.990 --> 06:29.594
- [All]: What?

06:29.650 --> 06:32.687
- It's no fair! Like I'd steal
her stupid toilet water!

06:32.740 --> 06:34.549
- It's about $40!
- More, actually.

06:34.610 --> 06:36.293
- We'd each lose
half a day's pay.

06:36.350 --> 06:38.432
- Please, it doesn't matter.
- It sure does.

06:38.480 --> 06:39.959
It was stupid to
bring it here,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.399
but that doesn't mean

06:41.440 --> 06:43.260
it's OK for someone
to take it.

06:46.050 --> 06:48.701
[Women groaning, scoffing]

06:48.750 --> 06:51.480
I'm putting you
in the storeroom

06:51.540 --> 06:53.440
to verify shipping lots.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.274
- By myself?

06:55.320 --> 06:58.448
- It's a chance to ask
yourself some questions.

06:58.500 --> 07:01.879
- Look, these are
wedding announcements,

07:01.940 --> 07:04.500
recipes, football scores--

07:04.550 --> 07:06.893
- Don't spar with my
intelligence, Mr. Moretti.

07:06.940 --> 07:08.157
I'm not a fool.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.768
If_ this were _
a faSCIst communiqu

07:09.820 --> 07:12.721
we'd found in your locker,
it would be in code.

07:12.780 --> 07:15.032
- Look, I've lived
in Canada since I was 2.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.389
I have the right to work here.
They vetted me!

07:17.430 --> 07:20.991
- You hired an Italian to work
in a munitions factory?

07:21.040 --> 07:23.179
- With the men overseas,
the pool was limited.

07:23.220 --> 07:26.178
His family ran a fireworks
factory before the war.

07:26.220 --> 07:28.222
- Before the war,
it was another world.

07:28.270 --> 07:31.649
Mr. Moretti, you need to
change clothes and come with us.

07:31.710 --> 07:33.052
- Whoa!

07:33.100 --> 07:34.579
You're arresting me?

07:34.620 --> 07:36.759
Harold, do something!
Tell him!

07:36.800 --> 07:38.791
- My hands are tied.

07:38.840 --> 07:41.229
- If you'd done your job
in the first place,

07:41.280 --> 07:43.885
we wouldn't be dancing
this little tarantella.

07:43.940 --> 07:45.328
- Let's go!

08:05.440 --> 08:07.692
[Birds chirping]

08:09.440 --> 08:11.260
- Steel yourself.

08:11.310 --> 08:13.528
- Don't tell me.
- Your mother's out for blood.

08:13.580 --> 08:15.969
- Don't.
I smell of cordite.

08:16.010 --> 08:18.968
Someone stole my
Fleurs de Rocaille.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.226
- That stinks.
- Yeah.

08:20.280 --> 08:21.622
- I'm not surprised though.

08:21.670 --> 08:24.104
I'm sure all the girls
are sick with envy.

08:24.150 --> 08:26.493
Don't worry. I'll buy
you another bottle.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.974
- Except now my matron's
docking their pay.

08:29.030 --> 08:30.895
- Wow...
- They can't afford it.

08:30.940 --> 08:32.760
- Well, if it's
any consolation,

08:32.810 --> 08:35.370
I don't mind the smell
of cordite one bit.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.029
Oh! In fact,
I even like it.

08:40.080 --> 08:42.036
[Laughs]

08:42.080 --> 08:43.513
- You're a peach.

08:44.870 --> 08:46.826
What's got Mother
on the warpath?

08:46.870 --> 08:48.121
- What do you think?

08:48.170 --> 08:49.865
- Oh, don't tell me.
Our wedding?

08:49.920 --> 08:51.911
- Ah, best spray
yourself with something.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.656
One sniff of that explosive,
she'll burst into flames.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.520
[Sighs]

08:56.570 --> 08:59.391
- Wedding invitations went
in the post this morning.

08:59.450 --> 09:01.133
Then, this afternoon
at the club,

09:01.190 --> 09:04.182
Mary Kimbark traipses in
to tell me about Dick Spencer.

09:04.230 --> 09:06.141
- Who's Dick Spencer?

09:06.190 --> 09:08.181
- James hasn't told you?

09:08.240 --> 09:11.368
- My cousin Richard
walked out on his wife.

09:11.420 --> 09:15.459
- He bolted like a feral pig
with his children's nanny!

09:15.510 --> 09:17.728
- Honestly, Mother,
there's a war going on.

09:17.770 --> 09:19.988
Men are dying.
Children are fatherless.

09:20.030 --> 09:22.908
The whole of Leningrad's
under a Nazi chokehold.

09:22.950 --> 09:24.645
- We're under
a chokehold too.

09:24.690 --> 09:26.555
All eyes will be
on this wedding,

09:26.600 --> 09:28.295
waiting for any
whiff of scandal.

09:28.350 --> 09:30.386
And when you shake
the hand of a man

09:30.430 --> 09:33.433
who sneered at marriage
by running off with the staff,

09:33.480 --> 09:35.528
you make a mockery
of your own union.

09:35.570 --> 09:37.959
- Mother, who cares
what people think?

09:38.010 --> 09:41.173
- Remember what happened to
the Robinsons when they invited

09:41.230 --> 09:44.188
that pro-Hitler Brown Shirt
to their silver anniversary?

09:44.230 --> 09:45.219
Social exile.

09:46.970 --> 09:49.530
- I'll speak with Richard.
We'll work out a solution.

09:49.580 --> 09:51.275
- Splendid.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.800
When you occupy
the top shelf, darling,

09:53.850 --> 09:56.899
people are only too
eager to drag you down.

09:59.380 --> 10:01.325
- Queer way of
serving your country,

10:01.380 --> 10:04.338
planting a newspaper
in a man's locker.

10:04.380 --> 10:05.984
- He reads that rag every day.

10:06.040 --> 10:08.292
It's time the authorities
knew about it.

10:08.340 --> 10:10.251
- So you're watching him?

10:10.300 --> 10:12.643
-_ Who knows what's
in that newspaper?

10:12.690 --> 10:14.999
If he gets worked up
about what he reads,

10:15.040 --> 10:16.951
decides to help
the Nazi cause,

10:17.000 --> 10:20.083
that's a_ man with a lot of
exploswes on his hands.

10:20.140 --> 10:21.789
If he's done
nothing wrong,

10:21.830 --> 10:24.390
then he has nothing
to worry about.

10:24.440 --> 10:27.796
- You know, I fought alongside
some Italians in my war.

10:27.840 --> 10:29.614
- You didn't fight
with Marco Moretti.

10:29.670 --> 10:30.625
- That's true.

10:30.670 --> 10:32.149
But from what you tell me,

10:32.190 --> 10:35.148
he was a kid at the time and
already living in Canada, so...

10:40.420 --> 10:42.320
- [Man on radio]:
Since early September,

10:42.380 --> 10:44.940
German forces have
surrounded the City...

10:44.990 --> 10:47.242
- Just what the
doctor ordered.

10:48.340 --> 10:49.762
A second
sleeping pill.

10:49.820 --> 10:51.685
- Oh!

10:51.730 --> 10:54.335
This means the world.

10:54.390 --> 10:56.426
- Don't let
the bed bugs bite!

11:26.770 --> 11:28.067
- Impossible!

11:28.120 --> 11:29.371
- I can't believe it.

11:29.420 --> 11:30.944
- Buster knew
all about it,

11:30.990 --> 11:32.639
said they took
him last night.

11:32.690 --> 11:34.942
- Took who? Where?

11:34.990 --> 11:38.733
_- Marco. He was _taken to the
internment camp in Petawawa.

11:38.780 --> 11:40.862
- He seemed like
such a nice man.

11:40.910 --> 11:43.219
- Works as hard as any
of us, fighting Jerries.

11:43.260 --> 11:45.308
- Well, we don't intern
folks for no reason.

11:45.350 --> 11:47.079
If he's a risk,
then good riddance.

11:47.140 --> 11:49.529
- You honestly think
Marco is an enemy fascist?

11:59.060 --> 12:01.278
Don't forget your turban.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.756
- No need. I'm down in
the storeroom again today.

12:04.810 --> 12:06.368
- I wouldn't care for that.

12:06.420 --> 12:09.059
It's the kind of place
where murderers lurk.

12:09.110 --> 12:11.066
- Isn't that a lovely thought.

12:11.120 --> 12:12.769
Something wrong?

12:12.810 --> 12:14.983
- My scarf!
It was right here.

12:15.030 --> 12:16.634
- Again?

12:16.690 --> 12:18.203
- Somebody has
got it in for me.

12:18.250 --> 12:19.774
- Will you tell
Mrs. Corbett?

12:19.820 --> 12:22.254
- After yesterday's
debacle? Never!

12:25.480 --> 12:27.129
- What are you doing?

12:27.180 --> 12:29.307
- Have you seen
the Thin Man movies?

12:29.350 --> 12:31.215
Nick and Nora Charles?

12:33.620 --> 12:35.918
Let's just say
I've learnt a thing or two

12:35.970 --> 12:37.619
about how to catch a thief.

12:37.660 --> 12:40.788
- Since Marco started here,
she never liked him.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.967
- It's hard to
fight them overseas

12:43.020 --> 12:45.488
if we're busy sharing
biscuits with them here.

12:45.540 --> 12:48.270
- That's what I'll be
living off, thanks to Gladys.

12:48.330 --> 12:51.891
- I'm so sorry. I'll pay each
and every one of you back.

12:51.940 --> 12:53.851
- Think you can
buy us off?

12:53.900 --> 12:55.549
- What else am
I supposed to do?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.374
- Not rat in
the first place.

12:57.420 --> 13:00.241
- If something's missing,
could be us next.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.813
Let's not forget that.

13:01.860 --> 13:05.330
- I can't stop thinking
about those internment camps.

13:05.390 --> 13:08.644
- They say it's worse than
being a prisoner of war.

13:08.700 --> 13:11.385
Sure seems different
here without him.

13:12.700 --> 13:15.487
- Nobody else

13:15.530 --> 13:18.522
Can walk it for you

13:18.580 --> 13:23.005
You gotta walk it

13:23.060 --> 13:26.439
By yourself

13:26.500 --> 13:29.492
My mother walked

13:29.540 --> 13:33.192
That lonesome valley

13:33.240 --> 13:37.028
- [Man]:
She had to walk it

13:37.070 --> 13:40.631
By herself

13:40.680 --> 13:43.854
Nobody else

13:43.910 --> 13:47.164
Could walk it for her

13:48.210 --> 13:51.429
She had to walk it

13:51.480 --> 13:55.598
By herself

13:55.660 --> 13:59.209
We each of us walk

13:59.270 --> 14:03.001
The lonesome valley

14:03.050 --> 14:06.531
- [Both]:
We gotta walk it

14:06.580 --> 14:10.755
By ourselves

14:10.800 --> 14:14.019
Nobody else

14:14.070 --> 14:17.619
Can walk it for us

14:17.680 --> 14:21.377
We gotta walk it

14:21.420 --> 14:25.333
By ourselves

14:25.380 --> 14:27.428
- Hello?

14:27.470 --> 14:29.722
Hello?

14:29.780 --> 14:32.340
- [Woman]: If you're
going to smoke that,

14:32.390 --> 14:34.381
do it away from
the oxygen tanks.

14:34.430 --> 14:36.159
[Archie laughs]

14:50.840 --> 14:53.183
[Sniffing]

14:58.370 --> 15:01.237
- Hey, Vera.

15:01.290 --> 15:02.939
Hey, come on!
I won't bite.

15:05.510 --> 15:07.944
- I'm dying for
a cigarette.

15:11.340 --> 15:13.945
- It's_ nice to see
a friendly face.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.036
Or at least half of one.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.422
[Laughs]

15:17.480 --> 15:19.869
Hey, Vera! If you can't
laugh about it...

15:19.910 --> 15:22.959
I ain't running after
you, I promise you.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.342
Hey, look!

15:24.400 --> 15:27.654
Vera! Discovering fire.

15:39.320 --> 15:41.276
[Vera exhales,
Archie laughs]

15:41.330 --> 15:43.230
Don't the Vic-Mu girls
bring you cigs?

15:43.290 --> 15:46.100
- Oh, I can't stand
hearing them

15:46.160 --> 15:48.287
go on about how
sorry they are for me.

15:48.330 --> 15:50.150
- Yeah. I know what
that's like.

15:50.210 --> 15:51.677
I'm sitting here in pieces

15:51.730 --> 15:53.982
and you ain't even
cracked a joke yet.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.508
- At least you can
find the bright side.

15:56.560 --> 16:01.031
- Which, in your case,
seems to be the left side.

16:01.090 --> 16:02.955
- I ought to clock you.

16:03.000 --> 16:07.300
- Oh, go ahead.
P-p-put me outta my misery.

16:07.350 --> 16:09.489
[Chuckles]

16:09.530 --> 16:11.009
Hey...

16:11.050 --> 16:13.746
You gotta laugh about it
or you're gonna cry.

16:13.790 --> 16:16.486
- Yeah, except I only
got one eye that works.

16:16.540 --> 16:18.053
- That's the spirit.

16:27.330 --> 16:30.026
- Say, you fellows work
the storerooms?

16:30.070 --> 16:32.413
- We work wherever
you want, sweetheart.

16:32.460 --> 16:35.941
- I was doing inventory
and I heard this singing.

16:35.990 --> 16:38.902
- That'd be me.
Howdy, I'm Donald.

16:38.950 --> 16:40.645
- Kate. Pleased to meet you.

16:40.690 --> 16:42.601
Where did you learn
to sing like that?

16:42.650 --> 16:45.471
- Comes natural.
The way all good things do.

16:45.520 --> 16:48.910
- Well, I just wanted to say
it was very nice.

16:48.960 --> 16:51.918
- I hope we can make music
again some time.

17:04.500 --> 17:07.492
- You, Hazel?
You're the thief?

17:07.540 --> 17:09.189
- You're nutty
as a fruitcake.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.458
- Gladys, you gotta
be kidding.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.582
- Her hands are purple!
I set a trap.

17:13.640 --> 17:16.723
I poured silver nitrate from
the first-aid kit into my purse.

17:16.770 --> 17:19.204
And look, our thief's
hands are a telltale purple.

17:19.250 --> 17:21.901
- I cut myself on
a casing this morning.

17:21.950 --> 17:23.645
Is that a crime,
disinfecting it?

17:23.690 --> 17:25.032
- Well, where's
the bandage?

17:25.080 --> 17:27.253
- Hey! Quit wrecking stuff.

17:27.300 --> 17:30.167
- Well, maybe you did
cut yourself,

17:30.220 --> 17:33.041
but you can't deny that
smell is Fleurs de Rocaille.

17:33.090 --> 17:35.263
- Fleurs de what?
- Gladys, Hazel's no thief.

17:35.310 --> 17:37.084
- Colognes are
all the same.

17:37.140 --> 17:39.529
- I could tell
that smell anywhere!

17:42.140 --> 17:45.837
- Like I said,
a fruitcake.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.060
- Now alas

17:52.110 --> 17:55.932
Must my fond
hopes all vanish

17:55.980 --> 17:58.153
For they say

17:58.200 --> 18:01.897
You are going away

18:01.950 --> 18:03.372
- Nice pipes.

18:03.430 --> 18:05.239
- Oh! Donald!

18:05.300 --> 18:06.813
- Red River Valley.

18:06.860 --> 18:08.418
Is that your story?

18:08.470 --> 18:11.086
Is there a boy overseas
you're sweet on?

18:11.130 --> 18:12.472
- Me? No.

18:12.520 --> 18:15.478
It's just my mom
and my brothers I miss.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.476
- How about you teach me?

18:17.530 --> 18:21.489
- Oh, I couldn't teach
anyone anything.

18:21.530 --> 18:23.748
It's you I could
learn from.

18:24.790 --> 18:26.223
- Well...

18:29.320 --> 18:32.278
First, we'd best get
the bellows full...

18:37.500 --> 18:39.456
I'm just trying
to school you.

18:39.500 --> 18:42.412
Try again. Come on.

18:43.510 --> 18:45.068
- Stop! Stop that!

18:45.120 --> 18:46.849
- Come now, Katie.

18:46.900 --> 18:48.856
Why'd you invite me
down here, huh?

18:48.910 --> 18:51.424
- I didn't invite anybody!
You work here!

18:52.560 --> 18:54.209
Please! Stop! Stop!

18:54.260 --> 18:56.865
- Relax, I won't
tell anybody.

18:59.220 --> 19:00.778
[Donald grunts]

19:08.450 --> 19:10.793
- He had it coming.

19:19.110 --> 19:20.589
- Is he dead?

19:22.290 --> 19:24.246
- He'll be back on
his feet soon enough.

19:24.290 --> 19:25.939
Won't know what hit him.

19:25.990 --> 19:28.550
- If he thinks I did this,
I could be in real trouble.

19:28.600 --> 19:30.113
- Donald won't report nothing.

19:30.160 --> 19:32.981
He'd have to tell the boss
what he was doing down here.

19:33.040 --> 19:34.985
- He could just say
he was working.

19:35.040 --> 19:37.508
- I'm the one stationed
down here, not him.

19:37.560 --> 19:40.950
- So that was you
singing this morning?

19:41.000 --> 19:44.219
- Best get going
before he comes to.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.135
- That was your voice
in the dark.

19:47.400 --> 19:50.096
You're really good,
you know that?

19:50.140 --> 19:53.052
- And look at
the trouble it got me.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.352
[Sighs]

19:55.410 --> 19:57.275
- What happened
to Mr. Moretti?

19:57.320 --> 19:58.799
The girls are gossiping.

19:58.840 --> 20:01.229
I'd like to put an end
to their tall tales.

20:01.280 --> 20:03.236
- Yeah, well
you can tell them

20:03.280 --> 20:05.589
I'm hiring a new
materials controller.

20:05.630 --> 20:07.029
Shame too.

20:07.070 --> 20:09.504
Moretti's experience was
tailor-made for this place.

20:09.550 --> 20:12.110
- Well, I'm sure you'll
find someone else.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.468
- Well, I'll have to, hmm?

20:13.510 --> 20:15.296
He'll be interned now,
with his father.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.252
The rest of his family
will be going hungry.

20:18.300 --> 20:20.336
I pushed his paycheque
through petty cash.

20:20.390 --> 20:22.085
I can't send money
through the mail.

20:22.130 --> 20:23.859
- What do I want it for?

20:23.910 --> 20:25.559
- It needs to get
to his family.

20:25.610 --> 20:28.340
- Then you deliver it.
You're the one who fired him.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.823
- Well, he's not gonna
be happy to see me.

20:30.880 --> 20:34.225
- He's not gonna be rolling out
the welcome mat for me either.

20:35.530 --> 20:37.134
- Take this money.

20:37.190 --> 20:39.579
Give it to the
Moretti family tonight.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.929
- [James]: I'll race you!

20:53.990 --> 20:55.469
- This day's already
got me beat

20:55.510 --> 20:57.899
and now you're lining up
to leave me in the dirt?

21:01.040 --> 21:03.122
- Is your thief
still at large?

21:03.170 --> 21:04.250
- Yes and no.

21:04.300 --> 21:06.518
I caught the girl,
Hazel McDougall.

21:06.560 --> 21:08.733
But do you think anyone
would believe me?

21:08.780 --> 21:09.997
- You caught her?

21:10.050 --> 21:11.301
- Well, no.

21:11.350 --> 21:13.341
And she's added my
new scarf to her cache,

21:13.400 --> 21:14.788
the one you gave me.

21:14.830 --> 21:16.786
- That's t_errible.

just take what's mine,

21:19.010 --> 21:21.228

step over this cesspool.

21:23.360 --> 21:24.918
- Why would I?

21:24.970 --> 21:26.494
- You don't wanna
make waves.

21:26.540 --> 21:29.236
If people find out you're
working the factory floor...

21:29.280 --> 21:31.328
- James, I want you
to help me, not stop me.

21:31.370 --> 21:33.588
- It's just a stupid
bottle of perfume.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.062
- Yeah, from you!

21:35.110 --> 21:36.634
Maybe I'm a little
old-fashioned,

21:36.680 --> 21:38.068

- I live here.

22:02.930 --> 22:05.535

to an internment camp.

is that what you wanted?

22:08.410 --> 22:09.752
- No! Ij--

22:09.800 --> 22:11.882
- That was hearsay,
just like the gossip

22:11.930 --> 22:13.841
that got the authorities
swarming me.

22:19.720 --> 22:22.462
- You planted that
newspaper, didn't you?

22:25.300 --> 22:27.518

suspicious behaviour.

My mother doesn't know
this is my last paycheque.

23:24.490 --> 23:26.526

23:36.150 --> 23:38.141
- Well, I wish you'd
run and found me.

23:38.190 --> 23:39.976
- But I wasn't frightened.

23:40.020 --> 23:42.068
- Not frightened?

23:42.110 --> 23:45.762
You watched a guy clobber your
would-be rapist over the head.

23:45.810 --> 23:47.323
Maybe you were in shock.

23:47.380 --> 23:50.019
- I would have been,
except this man saved me.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.638
- Yeah, for himself.

23:51.690 --> 23:53.078

23:55.950 --> 23:57.554
- I don't make a habit of it.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.737
- Maybe he'll be
in the storeroom tomorrow.

23:59.780 --> 24:01.509
- Then you be
sure you aren't.

24:01.570 --> 24:03.219
- It's my mess
he cleaned up.

24:03.260 --> 24:05.569
I thought I could carry
one thing from my past,

24:05.610 --> 24:07.009
the locket my mother gave me.

24:07.050 --> 24:08.392
Was I ever wrong.

you're inside this room.

24:19.630 --> 24:21.450

24:22.850 --> 24:24.363
What a surprise!

24:24.410 --> 24:26.196

you doing here?

24:26.240 --> 24:28.151
- [Gladys]: So this
is where you live.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.328
I hope you don't mind. I got
Carol to look up your address.

24:31.380 --> 24:33.371
- And what brings
you slumming?

24:33.420 --> 24:35.638
- I need help
chasing down a thief.

24:35.690 --> 24:37.499
- Ah, we're having
a quiet night in,

24:37.560 --> 24:39.812
on account of we don't
have much spare cash.

24:39.860 --> 24:42.818
- If we find the culprit,
your pay won't get docked!

24:42.870 --> 24:45.509
- Do you really think
Hazel took your things?

24:45.570 --> 24:48.130
- You can't buy that scent
at your local Simpsons.

it's Leningrad,

If we can sniff out her loot,
your name will be cleared.

- Beats a quiet night in,
don't you think?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.797
Come on!

fight with management

we just had,

only bring us more trouble?

our best chance for passing.

What's left of it.

34:17.400 --> 34:20.005

34:32.500 --> 34:35.367
Maybe you didn't
know about me.

34:35.420 --> 34:38.196
But this is your chance
to do the right thing.

34:43.080 --> 34:46.550

shift for you, Hazel.

34:48.730 --> 34:49.947

you were gonna tear her up.

else already did.

just one song.

35:44.620 --> 35:46.008

but it--it's like you
put the life back in it.

35:51.410 --> 35:53.014
How do you sing like that?

- It's not for me to
school you, Miss Andrews.

35:58.890 --> 36:00.972
Nice knowing you.

So you also answer
to the new name

36:08.900 --> 36:10.288
- It was just the sound.

36:10.340 --> 36:12.854
- I spoke to every Marion
who works at Vic-Mu,

36:12.900 --> 36:14.948
and none of them
are missmg a locket.

36:14.990 --> 36:19.552
It also seems Gladys's
perfume was returned.

36:19.610 --> 36:22.955
- Yes, it's all
worked out, hasn't it?

36:23.000 --> 36:25.787
- Well, with this war on,
there's always things

36:25.830 --> 36:27.434
to keep an eye out for,

36:27.480 --> 36:29.914
Kate Andrews.

36:34.140 --> 36:36.961
- Your taste in women will get
you into trouble, Leon.

36:37.020 --> 36:39.272
- You're the one got hurt.

36:39.320 --> 36:40.719
- You keep this up,

36:40.760 --> 36:42.751
you'll wish
you never met her.

36:42.800 --> 36:45.064
- You touch her again,
I will make sure

36:45.110 --> 36:47.670
you can't so much as
push a broom around here.

36:47.720 --> 36:48.971
Do you understand me?

36:49.030 --> 36:52.113
- We'll see who's
pushing brooms.

37:00.430 --> 37:03.297
- You wanna learn
something about Singing,

37:03.350 --> 37:05.864
get to know Billie Holiday.

37:11.140 --> 37:12.528
- Psst!

37:14.530 --> 37:18.489
- Leon says I gotta meet
some guy named Billie Holiday.

37:20.020 --> 37:22.147
- I can make
the introductions.

37:22.190 --> 37:24.055
[Both laugh]

37:30.720 --> 37:33.769
- A double dose of pills should
have you sleeping like a baby.

37:33.810 --> 37:35.505
- You're an angel.

37:35.550 --> 37:37.199
- Anything else?

37:37.250 --> 37:39.150
- No, that should do me.

37:41.340 --> 37:42.773
- Good night.

37:50.700 --> 37:52.349
- Thanks for not
ratting me out.

37:52.400 --> 37:55.210
- Who am I to tell a gimp
how to live her life?

38:00.190 --> 38:02.135
[Sighs]

38:04.580 --> 38:07.276
How many more
do you need?

38:07.320 --> 38:08.844
- Thirty.

38:12.630 --> 38:14.586
- You know there
are other ways.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.894
The factory would take care of
you. You'd still have your job.

38:17.940 --> 38:19.635
- No, I can't go back there.

38:20.640 --> 38:22.335
Not like this.

38:23.640 --> 38:25.335
- Family?

38:25.390 --> 38:29.076
- I told them I moved
to Hollywood.

38:29.130 --> 38:30.779
Why give them
the satisfaction

38:30.830 --> 38:32.957
of knowing they
were right all along?

38:33.000 --> 38:35.252
That I was nothing
but a pretty face.

38:36.270 --> 38:38.170
And now I'm nothing.

38:38.220 --> 38:40.222
- Hey!

38:40.270 --> 38:42.522
Now, that ain't even true.

38:44.230 --> 38:46.448
You still got
a killer figure.

38:46.490 --> 38:49.448
Sand in all
the right places.

38:49.500 --> 38:52.014
- Beat it, Archie.

38:52.060 --> 38:54.494
We both need
our beauty sleep.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.841
- Good night, Vera.

38:57.900 --> 38:59.322
[Laughs]

39:08.430 --> 39:11.331
- Well, I just
got my appetite,

39:11.390 --> 39:13.210
right in time for dinner.

39:17.960 --> 39:20.690
Mmm. What's that new scent?

39:20.740 --> 39:22.264
- Soap and water.

39:22.310 --> 39:23.743
- Ooh!

39:23.790 --> 39:25.269
Why, how novel.

39:25.310 --> 39:27.699
- Yes.

39:27.750 --> 39:30.833
Seems we both
like simple things.

39:30.890 --> 39:32.835
- Is something wrong, Gladys?

39:35.850 --> 39:37.272
- Just the factory air.

39:37.330 --> 39:39.013
Sometimes it gets
a little close.

39:39.070 --> 39:41.630
- I do hope they ventilate
that office you're in.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.284
I'd hate to think of you

39:43.330 --> 39:46.151
breathing the same noxious fumes
as those floor girls.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.942
- Don't worry, Mother.

39:48.990 --> 39:51.948
They pipe in fresh mountain
breezes from the Rockies.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.298
- You can't vex me tonight.

39:53.340 --> 39:55.160
Not after your
fianc's great deeds.

39:55.210 --> 39:57.030
- I'm afraid to ask.

39:57.090 --> 39:59.900
- James found his cousin
an acceptable extrication.

39:59.960 --> 40:02.258
- I told Richard that
there was no way

40:02.310 --> 40:04.266
he was ruining
my bride's special day

40:04.310 --> 40:06.039
with a show
of his own infidelity.

40:06.090 --> 40:09.139
- So Mr. Spencer agreed to
schedule a holiday

40:09.180 --> 40:10.397
during your nuptials.

40:10.450 --> 40:12.008
- How clever.

40:12.060 --> 40:13.709
- That way,

40:13.750 --> 40:16.492
we can avoid any
unpleasantness altogether.

40:16.540 --> 40:20.010
- You've got a great future
in this town, James.

40:20.060 --> 40:22.449
In fact, you've inspired
another gambit of sorts.

40:22.500 --> 40:24.195
I was thinking,

40:24.240 --> 40:27.630
perhaps you might talk to
John Abbley about his parents.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.729
They're esteemed colleagues
and competitors.

40:30.770 --> 40:34.422
They begged off, as they'll
still be in Barbados,

40:34.470 --> 40:37.257
but they'd be a plum snag
for the guest list...

40:38.260 --> 40:40.034
- Gladys?

40:40.080 --> 40:41.957
- What's wrong now?

40:45.480 --> 40:47.653
- Something's robbed me
of my appetite.

40:47.700 --> 40:48.917
I'm sorry, James.

40:48.960 --> 40:50.962
I'm not much up for a meal.

41:10.290 --> 41:13.020
[ Record starts playing ]

41:21.560 --> 41:22.948
- [Betty]: You made it.

41:23.000 --> 41:25.730
- I may be a little
overdressed for euchre.

41:25.780 --> 41:27.509
- Oh, to heck with euchre!

41:27.570 --> 41:29.993
I stole the record player
from Moira down the hall!

41:30.050 --> 41:32.177
- "Borrowed" is probably
a better word.

41:32.220 --> 41:33.300
- Right. Good point.

41:35.270 --> 41:37.397
The pipes burst?

41:37.450 --> 41:39.099
- Water everywhere.

41:39.140 --> 41:40.960
- You talked to him?

41:41.020 --> 41:42.442
- I couldn't.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.149
If I drive a crack
in that wall now,

41:44.190 --> 41:46.181
the whole thing may come
crumbling down.

41:47.240 --> 41:50.289
- Well, you're here now.

41:50.330 --> 41:52.457
That's something.

41:52.510 --> 41:55.320
- [Record player]:
I'll never be the same...

41:55.380 --> 41:56.984
- And 50's Billie Holiday!

41:57.030 --> 41:58.816
Isn't she ginchy?

41:58.860 --> 42:03.388
- _ Skies have lost
their meaning for me

42:03.430 --> 42:06.809
I'll never be the same

42:06.870 --> 42:09.566
Nothing's what
it once used to be...

42:09.610 --> 42:11.919
- [Lorna]: It was on special.

42:14.350 --> 42:16.955
- You don't really expect
me to eat this, do you?

42:17.010 --> 42:20.525
- You'll never know if _
you like it unless you try it.

42:22.970 --> 42:25.359
- Is it supposed
to be so mushy?

42:25.410 --> 42:26.923
- It's different, Bob.

42:26.970 --> 42:29.666
Try something new.

42:53.910 --> 42:55.605
It's not bad.

42:56.830 --> 43:00.823
- I'll never be the same

43:00.880 --> 43:04.486
Skies have lost
their meaning for me

43:07.880 --> 43:11.623
I'll never be the same

43:11.670 --> 43:15.879
Nothing's what
it once used to be

43:17.810 --> 43:22.110
And when the songbirds
that sing

43:22.160 --> 43:24.412
Tell me it's spring

43:24.470 --> 43:28.588
I can't believe their song

43:29.780 --> 43:33.125
Once love was king

43:33.170 --> 43:37.345
But kings can be wrong

43:43.220 --> 43:47.042
There is such
an ache in my heart

43:50.970 --> 43:54.792
But there's a lot
that a smile can hide

43:57.460 --> 44:01.328
And I know deep down inside

44:01.370 --> 44:04.191
I'll never be the same

44:04.250 --> 44:07.242
Oh yeah
