00:01.836 --> 00:03.879
ELIZABETH: Who felt
the morning chill today?

00:05.213 --> 00:07.090
Well, I have a new class
assignment for everyone.

00:07.090 --> 00:11.052
We're all going to be learning
about weather.

00:11.052 --> 00:12.638
I'm going to assign you
in groups of two,

00:12.638 --> 00:14.640
and each team will be giving
a presentation

00:14.640 --> 00:16.934
based on a different aspect
of weather.

00:16.934 --> 00:18.435
For example,

00:18.435 --> 00:21.188
Cody and Anna,

00:21.188 --> 00:24.191
you will be giving
a presentation on clouds.

00:24.191 --> 00:27.611
Next, we have
Hattie and Robert.

00:27.611 --> 00:29.655
Your presentation
will be on rain.

00:29.655 --> 00:32.616
Harper and Emily,

00:32.616 --> 00:36.161
your assignment will be wind.

00:37.538 --> 00:39.164
Now, you may not
like Joshua Baxter--

00:39.164 --> 00:40.791
I don't know him
personally.

00:40.791 --> 00:43.669
What I don't like are
the businesses he promotes.

00:43.669 --> 00:45.713
It would be bad
for Hope Valley.

00:45.713 --> 00:47.339
If he had done
something illegal

00:47.339 --> 00:49.132
in those other towns
that you're talking about,

00:49.132 --> 00:51.092
he'd be under arrest.
One of the reason he isn't

00:51.092 --> 00:53.052
is because he controls
the sheriff and the mayor

00:53.052 --> 00:54.221
in those towns.

00:54.221 --> 00:56.181
You don't know that
for a fact.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.809
Now, my bank's facing a total
collapse without Baxter's money.

00:58.809 --> 01:00.227
We have a deal.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.270
Nothing is binding
until the papers are signed.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.272
The papers are
being drawn up as we speak.

01:04.272 --> 01:05.900
Meaning we still have time.

01:05.900 --> 01:07.568
Time? For what?

01:07.568 --> 01:09.444
For me
to convince Greta Preston

01:09.444 --> 01:12.031
to step up
and take Baxter's place.

01:12.031 --> 01:14.533
Her reputation is impeccable.

01:14.533 --> 01:16.035
If I can convince her

01:16.035 --> 01:17.536
to at least match
the same deal

01:17.536 --> 01:18.871
you made
with Baxter--

01:18.871 --> 01:20.247
"If" may be a small word,

01:20.247 --> 01:22.332
but it can do
an awful lot of harm.

01:22.332 --> 01:26.045
All I'm asking you to do
is slow down the paperwork.

01:26.045 --> 01:28.714
Tell Baxter your lawyers
need to look it over.

01:28.714 --> 01:31.425
But they don't. It's a very
straightforward contract.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.386
That may be,
but it'll buy us some time.

01:34.386 --> 01:36.304
And if Baxter
is truly committed,

01:36.304 --> 01:38.515
he won't mind a small delay.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.643
It's like
you've said before,

01:41.643 --> 01:45.064
you've been a good citizen
in this town for many years.

of Hope Valley

01:47.357 --> 01:49.359

01:53.030 --> 01:54.823
All right.

you kept your wedding ring on?

this sort of thing
is hereditary.

contact them about this.

wasn't right when...

these horrible headaches.

But I heard
it can be removed.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.875
I already tried,
with Amber.

04:51.875 --> 04:53.543
But sometimes,
the operation works, right?

04:53.543 --> 04:54.878
It's experimental.

04:54.878 --> 04:57.338
Not many doctors perform it,

04:57.338 --> 05:02.552
and those that do
are very unsuccessful.

05:02.552 --> 05:07.182
My doctor in Fairfield
isn't one of those specialists.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.601
He can't do the surgery.
