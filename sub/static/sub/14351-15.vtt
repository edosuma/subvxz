WEBVTT

00:04.954 --> 00:07.492
Captain's log, stardate 5730.2.

00:07.665 --> 00:12.576
The planet Ariannus is vital as
a transfer point on commercial lanes.

00:12.754 --> 00:14.545
It has been attacked
by a bacterial invasion

00:14.714 --> 00:17.668
which threatens to render it lifeless
unless checked.

00:17.842 --> 00:21.128
Our mission: To decontaminate it.

00:21.304 --> 00:23.925
Mr. Chekov, an estimated time
of arrival for Ariannus.

00:24.098 --> 00:28.310
At present speed, our ETA
is three hours, four minutes, sir.

00:28.478 --> 00:31.229
Lieutenant Uhura,
advise the planet's ministry of health

00:31.397 --> 00:33.639
that we'll begin
decontamination procedures

00:33.816 --> 00:35.726
immediately upon locking into orbit.

00:35.902 --> 00:36.933
Aye, aye, sir.

00:37.111 --> 00:38.855
Scotty, will that present problems
for you?

00:39.030 --> 00:41.699
None. All tanks are being positioned.

00:41.866 --> 00:44.155
Sensors indicate a space vehicle
of some sort ahead.

00:44.327 --> 00:47.162
- Is it within visual range?
- Coming into range now, sir.

00:47.830 --> 00:50.119
It's following a very erratic course.

00:50.291 --> 00:52.699
Put it on the screen.
Extreme magnification.

00:58.549 --> 01:00.791
I think that may be
a Starfleet shuttlecraft, sir.

01:00.969 --> 01:03.210
That is exactly what it is,
Mr. Chekov.

01:03.388 --> 01:06.389
It looks like the one reported stolen
from Starbase 4 two weeks ago.

01:06.557 --> 01:09.891
Lieutenant Uhura, try to contact them
on command frequency 2.

01:10.061 --> 01:11.603
Aye, captain.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:20.363 --> 01:21.561
No response, sir.

01:21.739 --> 01:25.108
- Try all frequencies.
- Aye, sir. Hailing on all frequencies.

01:25.285 --> 01:27.823
Captain, there is one living creature
aboard.

01:27.996 --> 01:31.080
Humanoid. He is either injured or ill.

01:31.249 --> 01:34.416
The craft
shows internal atmospheric leakage.

01:34.586 --> 01:36.578
The creature may be suffocating.

01:36.754 --> 01:38.664
Lieutenant Sulu,
activate tractor beams.

01:39.340 --> 01:42.045
Tractor beams activated.
We have it, sir.

01:42.218 --> 01:44.092
- Bring it aboard the hangar deck.
- Aye, sir.

01:44.262 --> 01:47.216
- Send a security team to the doors.
- Aye, sir.

01:47.390 --> 01:50.427
Mr. Spock, come with me. Scotty.

01:56.274 --> 02:00.354
Hangar doors opened and clearing
for entrance of shuttlecraft.

02:00.528 --> 02:03.019
Shuttlecraft
approaching hangar deck.

02:09.454 --> 02:11.826
- Bridge to Captain Kirk.
- Kirk here.

02:11.998 --> 02:14.323
Hangar doors are closed,
and hangar deck pressurising.

02:14.501 --> 02:16.161
Acknowledged.

02:27.973 --> 02:31.721
We'll enter as soon as the doors open.
We'll go on my command.

02:58.670 --> 03:02.169
Space, the final frontier.

03:07.554 --> 03:11.765
These are the voyages
of the starship Enterprise.

03:11.933 --> 03:15.978
Its five-year mission:
To explore strange new worlds,

03:16.146 --> 03:19.930
to seek out new life
and new civilisations,

03:20.108 --> 03:23.560
to boldly go where no man
has gone before.

04:06.655 --> 04:09.905
You are certain, doctor,
that this pigmentation

04:10.075 --> 04:12.744
is the natural condition
of this individual?

04:12.911 --> 04:15.034
That's what I've recorded,
Mr. Spock.

04:15.205 --> 04:17.161
Do we have any knowledge
of a planet

04:17.332 --> 04:20.250
that could have produced
such a race of beings?

04:20.418 --> 04:23.088
- Negative, captain.
- Bones, what do you make of it?

04:23.255 --> 04:26.540
Well, I can't give you any specific
circumstance that will explain him.

04:26.717 --> 04:29.042
Judging by looking at him,
we know at the very least

04:29.219 --> 04:33.549
he is the result
of a very dramatic conflict. Spock?

04:33.724 --> 04:36.428
There is no theory, captain,
from the basic work of Mendel

04:36.602 --> 04:40.018
to the most recent nucleotide studies,
which would explain our captive.

04:40.189 --> 04:42.561
All gradations of colour
from black to brown

04:42.733 --> 04:45.817
to yellow to white
are genetically predictable.

04:45.986 --> 04:49.521
We must therefore conclude
that this alien

04:49.698 --> 04:55.534
is that often unaccountable rarity,
a mutation, one of a kind.

04:55.704 --> 04:57.780
Yes, I would agree.
That's the case here.

04:57.956 --> 05:00.364
- Your prognosis, doctor?
- Well, I can't give you one, Jim.

05:00.542 --> 05:03.579
I've never worked on anyone like him,
or anything like him.

05:03.754 --> 05:06.755
Yet you are pumping him full
of your noxious potions

05:06.924 --> 05:08.038
as if he were a human.

05:09.301 --> 05:12.053
When in doubt,
the book prevails, Mr. Spock.

05:12.221 --> 05:15.755
I've run tests. Blood is blood,
even when it's green like yours.

05:15.933 --> 05:18.934
The organs are there.
They're rearranged to a degree,

05:19.103 --> 05:21.344
plus a few I've never seen before.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.728
Now, I've enriched the oxygen content
of his blood,

05:23.899 --> 05:26.568
and pumped in a strong stimulant.

05:28.153 --> 05:31.818
And I must say his recuperative
powers appear to be excellent.

05:32.825 --> 05:34.983
With your permission,
I shall do some further research

05:35.160 --> 05:36.952
and join you on the Bridge.

05:38.330 --> 05:39.493
He's coming around, doctor.

05:42.292 --> 05:44.000
Well.

05:44.545 --> 05:48.245
Touch-and-go there for a minute,
but you're out of danger now.

05:52.803 --> 05:55.175
You're aboard
the starship Enterprise.

05:57.224 --> 06:01.553
I've heard of it.
It's in the United Fleet of Planets?

06:01.729 --> 06:06.521
Federation. So is the shuttlecraft
that you were flying in.

06:06.692 --> 06:07.937
It was?

06:08.110 --> 06:11.693
Don't you usually know
whose property you've stolen?

06:12.531 --> 06:13.942
I am not a thief.

06:14.116 --> 06:15.990
Well, certainly no ordinary thief,

06:16.160 --> 06:19.529
considering what it is
you appropriated.

06:19.705 --> 06:21.698
You're being very loose
with your accusations

06:21.874 --> 06:24.543
and drawing conclusions
without any facts.

06:24.710 --> 06:28.624
Well, I do know that you made off
with a ship that didn't belong to you.

06:28.797 --> 06:30.173
I do not make off with things.

06:30.341 --> 06:32.464
My need gave me the right
to use the ship.

06:32.635 --> 06:35.552
Mark the word, sir. The use of it.

06:35.721 --> 06:39.055
You can try those technical evasions
on Starfleet Command.

06:39.225 --> 06:42.428
That's where you'll be facing
your charges.

06:42.603 --> 06:45.059
I'm grateful for your rescue.

06:46.273 --> 06:49.938
Don't mention it.
We're pleased to have caught you.

06:51.070 --> 06:52.897
Who are you?

06:53.072 --> 06:54.899
My name is Lokai.

06:55.491 --> 06:57.069
Go on.

06:57.576 --> 06:59.569
From the planet Cheron.

07:00.496 --> 07:03.580
That's in the southernmost part
of the galaxy,

07:03.749 --> 07:05.623
in an unchartered quarter.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.832
What are you doing
so far from home?

07:10.464 --> 07:13.134
You understand
that when we complete our mission,

07:13.300 --> 07:14.759
we'll take you to starbase,

07:14.927 --> 07:16.920
where you'll face
a very serious charge.

07:17.096 --> 07:18.259
The charge is trifling.

07:18.431 --> 07:20.507
I would have returned the ship
as soon as l...

07:22.435 --> 07:24.059
What? What were you going to do?

07:24.687 --> 07:26.430
You monotone humans are all alike.

07:26.605 --> 07:28.397
First you condemn and then attack.

07:30.860 --> 07:32.817
I will answer no more questions.

07:33.779 --> 07:38.607
Well, however we view him, captain,
he's certainly no ordinary specimen.

07:38.784 --> 07:41.536
Well, Lokai, I don't know
what's normal for you exactly,

07:41.704 --> 07:42.783
but if I had your readings,

07:42.955 --> 07:47.285
I would be the most incredible
physical specimen of all time.

07:47.460 --> 07:49.287
We've never encountered
a being like you.

07:49.462 --> 07:52.249
I'd like to know more about you
and your planet.

07:53.049 --> 07:55.718
- I'm very tired.
- And very evasive.

07:55.885 --> 07:59.752
Or at least not fully responsive.
Now, then.

07:59.931 --> 08:01.722
I insist. I am extremely tired,

08:01.891 --> 08:05.426
made so
by your vindictive cross examinations.

08:06.312 --> 08:07.557
I will answer no more questions.

08:13.361 --> 08:15.188
- Lieutenant Uhura.
- Lieutenant Uhura here.

08:15.363 --> 08:18.648
Notify Starbase 4
that we've recovered its shuttlecraft,

08:18.825 --> 08:22.525
and it will be returned
along with its user

08:22.703 --> 08:24.779
as soon as we've completed
our mission at Ariannus.

08:24.956 --> 08:26.414
Aye, sir.

08:27.583 --> 08:28.663
Bones, if you're satisfied

08:28.835 --> 08:30.495
that the mutation theory
is applicable,

08:30.670 --> 08:32.294
I'll make a note of it in my report.

08:32.462 --> 08:35.333
Unless we get more information
from him, it'll have to serve.

08:38.594 --> 08:41.548
- Kirk here.
- Captain, contact with alien ship, sir.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.474
I'll be right there. Notify Mr. Spock.

08:52.859 --> 08:55.646
Put the ship
on the viewing screen, Mr. Sulu.

08:57.905 --> 08:59.649
Magnification.

09:02.702 --> 09:06.367
- Still nothing, Mr. Chekov.
- I verify, sir. It's out there.

09:12.670 --> 09:14.877
Maximum magnification.

09:19.802 --> 09:21.795
I draw a blank, Mr. Spock.
Your response?

09:21.971 --> 09:23.002
Negative, captain.

09:23.181 --> 09:26.384
No malfunction, sir.
The reading persists.

09:32.899 --> 09:35.900
- What is it?
- There is a vessel out there, captain.

09:36.069 --> 09:38.986
Could it be a Romulan ship
using their cloaking device?

09:39.155 --> 09:41.064
Negative.
This would not be a Romulan vessel.

09:41.241 --> 09:44.158
It is totally alien in configuration.

09:44.327 --> 09:45.905
Motive power unknown.

09:46.079 --> 09:47.739
The small size of the craft

09:47.914 --> 09:51.912
indicates a rapid scout vessel,
one or two-man crew.

10:05.432 --> 10:08.349
Captain,
I've tried all hailing frequencies.

10:08.518 --> 10:09.597
Negative, sir.

10:11.354 --> 10:13.845
- Weaponry on the vessel, Spock?
- Nothing identifiable.

10:14.023 --> 10:16.597
The craft appears to be built for speed
rather than combat.

10:16.776 --> 10:20.192
Something out there can't be seen.
Explanation?

10:20.363 --> 10:25.950
None. Completely elusive.
In fact, it's invisible.

10:26.995 --> 10:28.109
Invisible.

10:33.710 --> 10:35.288
Malfunction?

10:35.462 --> 10:37.335
There is no sensor failure.

10:37.505 --> 10:38.786
The readings persist.

10:44.137 --> 10:45.880
It's headed straight for us.

10:49.309 --> 10:51.266
Evasive action.

10:54.940 --> 10:58.273
It shifts with us, sir,
and we're pushing to the limit.

11:00.487 --> 11:03.322
- Deflector shields activated, Mr. Sulu.
- Automatic, sir.

11:03.490 --> 11:04.949
We're on collision course.

11:05.116 --> 11:07.572
It's out of control
or a suicide mission.

11:07.744 --> 11:10.152
Sound warning for collision.
Red Alert.

11:20.423 --> 11:23.294
Brace yourself for collision.
Brace yourself.

11:36.356 --> 11:37.934
Readout, Mr. Spock?

11:38.108 --> 11:41.192
It just... disintegrated.

11:42.612 --> 11:44.688
- Fascinating.
- What is it now?

11:44.865 --> 11:50.701
It is gone now, captain, but it seems
to have deposited an alien presence.

11:51.413 --> 11:52.658
Where?

11:52.831 --> 11:54.705
Right here, captain.

12:03.008 --> 12:04.122
Explain, Spock.

12:07.679 --> 12:09.173
One of a kind?

12:21.652 --> 12:24.652
- I am Bele.
- Of the planet Cheron, no doubt.

12:24.821 --> 12:27.194
Forgive my unorthodox arrival.

12:27.366 --> 12:30.402
Your mode of travel
was also unorthodox.

12:30.577 --> 12:32.570
Secure from Red Alert.

12:33.163 --> 12:35.072
What happened to your vehicle?

12:35.249 --> 12:36.992
It served me long and durably.

12:37.167 --> 12:39.373
Unfortunately,
the strain of arduous pursuit

12:39.544 --> 12:41.667
has exceeded
even its advanced qualities.

12:41.838 --> 12:45.539
I was just able to complete this trip
and disembark in time,

12:45.717 --> 12:49.549
or I would have disintegrated
in space with it.

12:49.721 --> 12:51.216
A most unique craft.

12:51.390 --> 12:53.596
Pity it couldn't be salvaged
for our study.

12:53.767 --> 12:56.223
Yes, it was sheathed
in special materials

12:56.395 --> 12:58.186
that rendered it invisible.

12:58.355 --> 13:00.727
What brings you to us?

13:01.441 --> 13:03.600
You bear precious cargo. Lokai.

13:04.069 --> 13:06.607
He has taken refuge aboard this ship.
I am here to claim him.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.868
All personnel aboard this vessel
are subject to my command.

13:19.293 --> 13:22.459
No one claims anyone
without due process.

13:24.131 --> 13:27.879
My apologies, captain.
I overstepped my powers.

13:28.052 --> 13:31.467
Claim is undoubtedly
an unfortunate word.

13:32.306 --> 13:34.595
What is your authorisation?
From what source?

13:34.767 --> 13:37.139
I am chief officer of the commission
on political traitors.

13:37.311 --> 13:40.395
Lokai was tried and convicted
of treason,

13:40.564 --> 13:42.473
but had escaped.

13:43.442 --> 13:47.771
- May I see him, please?
- He's in Sickbay.

13:48.614 --> 13:50.322
Remember,
since you're aboard the Enterprise,

13:50.491 --> 13:52.779
you're bound by its regulations.

13:53.744 --> 13:55.653
With your permission, captain.

14:00.501 --> 14:02.292
Mr. Spock.

14:19.395 --> 14:22.929
Well, Lokai,
it's a pleasure to see you again.

14:23.107 --> 14:28.860
This time I'm sure our joining
will be of a more permanent nature.

14:31.073 --> 14:32.188
You are to be congratulated.

14:32.366 --> 14:37.361
Never before has Lokai
been rendered so quiescent.

14:38.038 --> 14:41.324
I will not return to Cheron with him
to a land of murdering oppressors.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.576
I told you where you were going.

14:43.752 --> 14:48.165
I allowed your fellow countryman here
simply as a courtesy.

14:48.340 --> 14:54.545
And you see how this killer repays you,
as he repays all his benefactors.

14:54.722 --> 14:57.295
Benefactors? He's a liar.

14:57.475 --> 15:00.559
He raided our homes,
tore us from our families,

15:00.728 --> 15:04.227
herded us together like cattle,
and then sold us as slaves.

15:04.398 --> 15:05.429
They were savages, captain.

15:05.608 --> 15:07.351
We took them into our hearts,
our homes.

15:07.526 --> 15:08.724
We educated them.

15:08.903 --> 15:13.066
Yes, just education enough
to serve the master race.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.613
You were the product of our love,

15:16.160 --> 15:17.820
and you repaid us with murder.

15:17.995 --> 15:20.747
Why should a slave show mercy
to the enslaver?

15:20.915 --> 15:22.409
Slaves?

15:22.917 --> 15:25.075
That was changed thousands
of years ago.

15:25.252 --> 15:28.004
- You were freed.
- Freed.

15:29.131 --> 15:31.420
Were we free to be men?

15:31.592 --> 15:34.842
Free to be husbands and fathers?

15:35.012 --> 15:37.764
Free to live our lives
in equality and dignity?

15:37.932 --> 15:40.221
Yes, you were free,
if you knew how to use your freedom.

15:40.393 --> 15:41.851
You weren't free enough to slaughter

15:42.019 --> 15:44.261
and to burn all the things
that had been built.

15:44.981 --> 15:47.768
I tried to break the chains
of a hundred million people.

15:47.942 --> 15:50.943
My only crime is that I failed.
To that, I do plead guilty.

15:51.112 --> 15:54.481
There is an order in things.

15:54.907 --> 15:58.442
He asked for utopia in a day.

15:58.619 --> 16:01.786
- It can't be done.
- Not in a day.

16:01.956 --> 16:05.407
And not in ten times 10,000 years
by your thinking.

16:05.585 --> 16:08.455
To you, we are a loathsome breed
who will never be ready.

16:08.629 --> 16:11.001
Genocide for my people
is the plan for your utopia.

16:11.174 --> 16:14.839
You insane, filthy,
little plotter of ruin.

16:15.011 --> 16:20.218
You vicious subverter
of every decent thought.

16:20.391 --> 16:24.140
You're coming back
to pay for your crimes.

16:24.312 --> 16:26.803
I know you and all those
with whom you are plotting

16:26.981 --> 16:28.475
to take power permanently.

16:28.649 --> 16:31.485
When I return to Cheron,
you will understand what power is.

16:31.652 --> 16:33.396
I will have armies of followers.

16:35.323 --> 16:39.866
It is now very clear that you know
each other extremely well, gentlemen.

16:41.287 --> 16:44.323
The only service this ship can offer
is to bring you together.

16:44.499 --> 16:45.613
It is not a battlefield.

16:45.792 --> 16:47.915
Captain, I led revolutionaries,
not criminals.

16:48.086 --> 16:51.003
I demand political asylum.
This ship is a sanctuary.

16:51.672 --> 16:53.831
I'll tell you once more.

16:54.008 --> 16:56.167
For you, this ship is a prison.

16:56.344 --> 17:01.800
Captain, it is imperative
that you return Lokai to Cheron

17:01.974 --> 17:03.599
for judgement.

17:04.268 --> 17:06.675
Commissioner, Cheron
is not a member of the Federation.

17:06.854 --> 17:08.313
No treaties have ever been signed.

17:08.481 --> 17:12.098
Your demand for possession
of this prisoner cannot be honoured.

17:12.276 --> 17:15.480
There are no extradition procedures
to allow it.

17:15.905 --> 17:17.613
Is that clear, Commissioner Bele?

17:18.491 --> 17:21.527
Captain, I hope you will be sensible.

17:21.703 --> 17:23.826
- How do you mean?
- Cooperation.

17:23.997 --> 17:25.028
I cannot take sides.

17:27.125 --> 17:30.494
Since I am without a vessel
to return to Cheron,

17:30.670 --> 17:33.505
I insist that you take us there
immediately.

17:33.673 --> 17:34.918
Impossible. I have a mission.

17:35.091 --> 17:38.045
There's a planet to be decontaminated.
Millions of lives are at stake.

17:38.219 --> 17:40.710
Once that has been completed,
I'll return to Starbase 4

17:40.889 --> 17:43.130
and turn you both over
to the authorities.

17:43.308 --> 17:44.506
You can make your case to them.

17:46.311 --> 17:48.884
I am sorry, captain.
That will not be satisfactory.

17:49.063 --> 17:52.064
Not at all satisfactory.

17:53.818 --> 17:58.397
Commissioner, as a visiting dignitary
from a far planet,

17:58.573 --> 18:02.072
I offer you every hospitality aboard
this ship.

18:02.911 --> 18:06.244
- Choose any other course.
- You're the captain.

18:07.624 --> 18:09.451
Yes, I am.

18:10.418 --> 18:15.757
I think we can consider
your problem settled.

18:17.842 --> 18:19.669
At least for the present.

18:20.553 --> 18:25.892
I have ordered guest quarters
for you on Deck 6.

18:31.106 --> 18:36.527
I suggest you get a great deal of rest,
especially your vocal chords.

18:36.695 --> 18:38.568
It seems
you'll have a double opportunity

18:38.738 --> 18:42.570
to practise your oratory
on Starbase 4.

18:46.246 --> 18:50.244
Chekov to Captain Kirk.
Chekov to Captain Kirk. Urgent.

18:50.709 --> 18:52.785
- Kirk here.
- Captain, we're off course.

18:52.961 --> 18:55.534
- Well, get back on course.
- That's just it, sir.

18:55.714 --> 18:58.631
The ship's taken a new heading
all by itself.

19:00.010 --> 19:01.634
I'll be right there.

19:20.363 --> 19:22.155
- Have you located the malfunction?
- No, sir.

19:22.324 --> 19:25.159
The ship is unresponsive.
We're moving away from Ariannus.

19:25.327 --> 19:26.987
Explanation, Mr. Spock.

19:27.162 --> 19:29.487
Elusive, captain. I am investigating.

19:29.664 --> 19:32.120
I can't understand it.
I simply have no control.

19:33.251 --> 19:34.995
- Kirk to Engineering.
- Scott here.

19:35.170 --> 19:36.498
Scotty, we're suddenly off course.

19:36.671 --> 19:40.372
- Check out manoeuvring controls.
- Aye, sir. Hold.

19:43.261 --> 19:46.346
Captain, no malfunction indicated.

19:46.515 --> 19:48.092
Switch to auxiliary.

19:48.266 --> 19:50.058
Aye, sir. Out.

20:01.363 --> 20:03.854
- Engineer to Bridge.
- Kirk here.

20:04.032 --> 20:07.532
- On auxiliary, sir.
- Stand by for check.

20:17.963 --> 20:20.370
- Scotty, we're still off course.
- I'll be right up.

20:20.549 --> 20:23.218
- Speed, Mr. Chekov?
- We're moving at warp 8.

20:23.385 --> 20:26.137
- And new course?
- Four-oh-three, mark 7.

20:26.305 --> 20:28.878
Straight for the Coalsack
if there is no letup.

20:29.057 --> 20:31.548
Lieutenant Uhura,
put the ship on Red Alert.

20:33.603 --> 20:36.391
All hands, this is the captain.
The ship is on Red Alert.

20:36.565 --> 20:39.519
The ship is on Red Alert.

20:40.068 --> 20:42.559
There has been
an unidentified malfunction

20:42.738 --> 20:45.229
in the ship's directional control.

20:45.824 --> 20:50.616
Repeat. The ship is off course
and out of our control.

20:57.836 --> 21:01.086
- Our new heading, Mr. Chekov?
- Four-oh-three, mark 7.

21:01.965 --> 21:04.883
- Spock?
- Confirmed, captain. Holding pattern.

21:05.052 --> 21:08.255
Coordinates now indicate
we are charting course to...

21:09.097 --> 21:15.052
Captain, Cheron lies
between 403, mark 7 and mark 9.

21:17.648 --> 21:19.106
We are on the way to Cheron.

21:19.274 --> 21:22.524
Captain,
this ship is now under my direction.

21:26.573 --> 21:29.243
For 50,000 of your terrestrial years,

21:29.409 --> 21:32.280
I have been pursuing Lokai
through the galaxy.

21:32.454 --> 21:36.203
I have not travelled this far, this long
only to give him up now.

21:36.375 --> 21:38.913
This ship goes
where my will drives it.

21:39.086 --> 21:43.997
Captain, we are now at warp 10,
and the speed is increasing.

21:45.217 --> 21:48.420
Captain, course is now
clearly straight for Cheron,

21:48.595 --> 21:51.596
despite all efforts
to direct us to Ariannus.

21:52.057 --> 21:53.599
I will not return to Cheron.

21:53.767 --> 21:55.594
Captain,
you must guarantee me sanctuary.

21:55.769 --> 21:56.801
He cannot help you now.

21:56.979 --> 21:58.010
You are lost, Lokai.

21:58.188 --> 22:00.893
You are on the way to judgement,
to final punishment.

22:01.066 --> 22:03.984
- Stop him.
- Not this time, you evil mound of filth.

22:04.153 --> 22:05.481
Not this time.

22:05.654 --> 22:08.857
My cause is just. You must help me.
All of you must help me.

22:09.033 --> 22:11.737
Oh, the old cry. Pity me. Pity me.

22:11.910 --> 22:14.615
Everywhere he's gone,
he's been helped to escape.

22:14.788 --> 22:17.540
On every planet, he has found fools
who bleed for him

22:17.708 --> 22:20.744
and shed tears
for the oppressed one.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.711
But there is no escape for you
on this ship.

22:22.880 --> 22:28.716
- This is your last sanctuary.
- Kill him. Kill him.

22:28.886 --> 22:32.219
- You're two of a kind.
- And we are both going to Cheron.

22:32.389 --> 22:34.014
You cannot change
the course of this ship

22:34.183 --> 22:35.760
any more than you can change me.

22:35.935 --> 22:39.019
This ship goes where I want it to go.

22:39.897 --> 22:41.936
Security, put them both in the brig.

22:50.533 --> 22:51.861
Phasers on stun.

22:53.077 --> 22:54.488
Fire.

22:58.332 --> 23:01.666
Your phasers are ineffective
against our shields.

23:01.836 --> 23:03.959
You are helpless, captain.

23:04.130 --> 23:09.171
What a fool I am, expecting help
from someone like you.

23:12.138 --> 23:14.889
This ship is going to Ariannus.

23:15.057 --> 23:19.518
No, this ship is going to Cheron.

23:19.687 --> 23:23.435
I will let nothing interfere.

23:32.033 --> 23:34.155
We are going to Ariannus.

23:34.327 --> 23:37.078
The lives of a billion people
make no other choice possible.

23:37.246 --> 23:39.405
You are being obtuse, captain.

23:39.582 --> 23:41.621
I am permitting no choice.

23:41.792 --> 23:46.869
My will now controls this,
and nothing can break it.

23:47.048 --> 23:48.590
Bele.

23:49.925 --> 23:51.254
I am captain of this ship,

23:51.427 --> 23:54.048
and it will follow whatever course I set
for it

23:54.221 --> 23:56.713
or I will order its destruction.

24:01.270 --> 24:02.385
You're bluffing.

24:09.445 --> 24:13.443
I will destroy it.

24:16.953 --> 24:20.618
You can no more destroy this ship
than I can change colour.

24:23.626 --> 24:26.876
Lieutenant Uhura, tie in the Bridge
to the master computer.

24:27.046 --> 24:28.624
Aye, sir.

24:30.591 --> 24:35.004
Computer, destruct sequence.

24:35.179 --> 24:36.460
Are you ready to copy?

24:39.684 --> 24:41.392
Working.

24:48.109 --> 24:51.608
Prepare to verify
destruct sequence code 1.

24:57.744 --> 25:02.904
Computer, this is Captain James Kirk
of the USS Enterprise.

25:06.669 --> 25:11.461
Destruct sequence 1, code 1-1 A.

25:14.677 --> 25:19.838
Voice and code 1- 1 A
verified and correct.

25:20.683 --> 25:23.435
Sequence 1 complete.

25:27.523 --> 25:29.066
Mr. Spock.

25:29.233 --> 25:31.771
This is Commander Spock,
science officer.

25:35.782 --> 25:41.535
Destruct sequence number 2,
code 1-1 A-2B.

25:45.708 --> 25:51.129
Voice and code verified and correct.
Sequence 2 complete.

25:53.424 --> 25:54.539
Mr. Scott.

25:55.218 --> 25:57.590
This
is Lieutenant Commander Scott,

25:57.762 --> 26:01.012
chief engineering officer
of the USS Enterprise.

26:05.895 --> 26:08.386
Destruct sequence number 3.

26:08.565 --> 26:13.807
Code 1 B-2B-3.

26:18.575 --> 26:25.076
Voice and code 1 B-2B-3
verified and correct.

26:25.248 --> 26:28.534
Destruct sequence
completed and engaged.

26:28.710 --> 26:32.577
Awaiting final code
for 30-second countdown.

26:39.679 --> 26:44.175
Mr. Spock, has the ship returned
to the course set for it by my orders?

26:44.351 --> 26:48.051
Negative, captain.
We are still headed directly for Cheron.

26:48.229 --> 26:50.555
Destruct sequence engaged.

26:50.732 --> 26:54.943
Awaiting final code
for 30-second countdown.

26:55.111 --> 26:59.572
Computer, this is Captain James Kirk
of the USS Enterprise.

27:01.868 --> 27:08.618
Begin 30-second countdown.
Code 000.

27:08.792 --> 27:10.535
Destruct 0.

27:19.261 --> 27:21.087
Thirty seconds,

27:21.263 --> 27:26.601
29, 28, 27...

27:30.981 --> 27:32.641
Twenty-five seconds.

27:32.816 --> 27:36.648
Let's see you prevent the computer
from fulfilling my commands.

27:41.616 --> 27:44.072
Twenty seconds.

27:44.244 --> 27:45.904
From five to zero,

27:46.079 --> 27:49.993
no command in the universe
can prevent the computer

27:50.167 --> 27:52.159
from fulfilling its destruct order.

27:52.335 --> 27:54.411
Fifteen seconds.

27:54.588 --> 27:58.206
You can use your will
to drag this ship to Cheron,

27:58.383 --> 28:00.423
but I command the computer.

28:00.594 --> 28:02.752
Mine is the final command.

28:02.929 --> 28:07.757
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six...

28:07.934 --> 28:09.179
- I agree!
- Computer.

28:11.438 --> 28:14.355
This is Captain James Kirk
of the USS Enterprise.

28:15.609 --> 28:18.278
Code 123 continuity.

28:20.405 --> 28:21.816
Abort destruct order.

28:21.990 --> 28:28.704
Repeat. Code 123 continuity.

28:29.581 --> 28:31.989
Abort destruct order.

28:32.167 --> 28:38.336
Destruct order aborted.
Destruct order aborted.

28:41.885 --> 28:44.008
Mr. Spock,
is this ship headed for Ariannus?

28:44.179 --> 28:45.210
Negative, captain,

28:45.389 --> 28:47.714
the Enterprise is now moving
in a circular course.

28:47.891 --> 28:50.809
And at warp 10,
we're going nowhere mighty fast.

28:59.111 --> 29:01.981
I warned you of his treachery.
Kill him!

29:03.615 --> 29:06.071
We're waiting for you to fulfil
your commitment, commissioner.

29:07.411 --> 29:10.080
Captain, I am happy to have
you complete your mission of mercy

29:10.247 --> 29:11.575
to the planet Ariannus.

29:11.748 --> 29:15.580
It was madness to interfere
with such a worthwhile endeavour,

29:15.752 --> 29:18.919
but if you will, upon completion,

29:19.089 --> 29:23.834
please take me
and my traitorous captive to Cheron.

29:24.011 --> 29:26.217
I make no deals
for control of this ship, sir.

29:49.578 --> 29:51.784
The ship's course
is now in your control.

30:01.256 --> 30:02.288
Ship's course?

30:02.466 --> 30:05.301
Enterprise is now on course
to Ariannus, captain.

30:08.972 --> 30:10.632
Speed, Scotty?

30:10.808 --> 30:13.299
Warp 6 and smoothly operating, sir.

30:14.436 --> 30:15.847
Good.

30:17.022 --> 30:18.931
- Lieutenant Uhura, cancel Red Alert.
- Aye, sir.

30:19.108 --> 30:21.147
Let me reaffirm my position,
gentlemen.

30:21.318 --> 30:24.189
I could put you in the brig
for what you've done, but I won't do it,

30:24.363 --> 30:27.483
because you're new
to this part of the galaxy,

30:28.117 --> 30:30.904
which is governed
by the United Federation of Planets.

30:31.078 --> 30:35.407
We live in peace,
with full exercise of individual rights.

30:35.583 --> 30:38.252
The need to resort
to violence and force

30:38.419 --> 30:39.664
has long since passed,

30:39.837 --> 30:42.672
and it will not be tolerated
aboard this ship.

30:42.840 --> 30:46.256
You are free to move about the ship.

30:46.427 --> 30:50.721
I hope that you'll take the opportunity
to know more about the Federation

30:50.890 --> 30:55.219
through its best representatives,
my crew,

30:55.394 --> 30:57.470
but let me make it clear.

30:57.646 --> 31:01.181
I will stand for no interference
with the function of this ship.

31:02.610 --> 31:06.690
All hands, return to normal routine.
Captain out.

31:16.373 --> 31:19.992
You speak very well, captain.
Your words promise justice for all.

31:20.169 --> 31:21.200
We try.

31:21.378 --> 31:23.537
Yes, well,
I have learned to wait for actions.

31:23.714 --> 31:29.053
After Ariannus, what is justice?
I shall wait to see it dispensed.

31:33.099 --> 31:38.057
Fascinating.
Two irrevocably hostile humanoids.

31:38.229 --> 31:40.221
Disgusting is what I call them.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.731
That description
is not scientifically accurate.

31:43.901 --> 31:47.815
Mr. Spock, the word "disgusting"
describes exactly what I feel

31:47.989 --> 31:49.187
about those two.

31:49.365 --> 31:51.358
That's enough for today.

31:51.534 --> 31:53.989
Those two are beginning
to affect you.

32:01.085 --> 32:02.413
And I know from my actions,

32:02.586 --> 32:05.078
you must all think me
a volcanic hothead,

32:05.256 --> 32:07.794
erupting lava from my nostrils
at danger signals

32:07.967 --> 32:10.375
that are only figments
of my imagination.

32:10.928 --> 32:12.506
But believe me, my friends,

32:12.680 --> 32:15.301
there can be no moment
when I can have my guard down

32:15.474 --> 32:17.763
where such as Bele is present.

32:18.185 --> 32:19.466
So, what happens?

32:19.645 --> 32:23.643
I act the madman out of the anger
and frustration he forces upon me,

32:23.816 --> 32:26.983
and thereby prove his point
that I am a madman.

32:27.153 --> 32:29.940
No one knows
how he'll react under pressure, Lokai.

32:30.114 --> 32:32.783
After all, we are only human.

32:32.950 --> 32:36.485
Mr. Chekov,
therein lies my lack of ability

32:36.662 --> 32:38.454
to alert you and your captain

32:38.623 --> 32:41.577
to the real threat
of someone like Bele.

32:41.751 --> 32:43.245
You see,
you are from the planet Earth.

32:43.419 --> 32:46.088
There is no persecution
on your planet.

32:46.255 --> 32:49.007
How can you understand my fear,
my apprehension,

32:49.175 --> 32:51.500
my degradation, my suffering?

32:51.677 --> 32:53.919
There was persecution
on Earth once.

32:54.097 --> 32:56.089
I remember reading about it
in my history class.

32:56.265 --> 32:58.756
Yes, but it happened way back
in the 20th century.

32:58.935 --> 33:01.805
There is no such primitive thinking
today.

33:02.146 --> 33:05.480
You have read about it in history,
I see.

33:05.650 --> 33:07.975
How can I make your flesh
know how it feels

33:08.152 --> 33:10.311
to see all those who are like you,

33:10.488 --> 33:14.272
and only because they are like you,
despised, slaughtered,

33:14.450 --> 33:15.482
and even worse,

33:15.660 --> 33:19.823
denied the simplest bit of decency
that is a living being's right?

33:19.997 --> 33:21.326
Do you know what it would be like

33:21.499 --> 33:25.248
to be dragged out of your hubble
into a war on another planet,

33:25.420 --> 33:27.661
a battle
that will serve your oppressor

33:27.839 --> 33:30.330
and bring death
to you and your brothers?

33:41.144 --> 33:43.469
Putting the matter into the hands
of your Starfleet Command

33:43.646 --> 33:45.805
is, of course, the proper procedure.
How long will it be

33:45.982 --> 33:47.310
before we hear from them, captain?

33:47.483 --> 33:50.021
I expect the answer
is already on its way.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.650
Well, then, let us drink
to their wise solution to our problem.

33:52.822 --> 33:54.020
Let's do that.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.238
Commissioner, Starfleet Command
may not arrive

33:56.409 --> 33:58.532
at the solution you anticipate.

33:58.953 --> 34:02.618
There is the matter of the shuttlecraft
which Lokai appropriated.

34:02.790 --> 34:04.617
The interrogation of that matter

34:04.792 --> 34:07.283
may be of paramount importance
to Starfleet.

34:08.087 --> 34:11.123
Gentlemen, we are discussing
a question of degree.

34:11.299 --> 34:14.300
Surely, stealing a shuttlecraft
cannot be equated

34:14.469 --> 34:17.138
with the importance
of murdering thousands of people.

34:17.304 --> 34:20.721
We do not know
that Lokai has done that.

34:21.559 --> 34:23.885
One thing we are agreed on
is that Lokai is a criminal.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.722
No, commissioner.
One thing we agreed upon

34:25.897 --> 34:28.684
is that Lokai took a shuttlecraft.
Excuse me.

34:28.858 --> 34:31.266
Lieutenant Uhura to Captain Kirk.

34:31.444 --> 34:32.902
- Kirk here.
- I have a communication

34:33.071 --> 34:34.898
- from Starfleet Command, sir.
- Let's read it.

34:36.533 --> 34:38.157
"Starfleet Command
extends greetings

34:38.326 --> 34:40.782
to Commissioner Bele
of the planet Cheron.

34:40.954 --> 34:43.908
His urgent request
to be transported to his planet

34:44.081 --> 34:46.239
with the man he claims prisoner

34:46.418 --> 34:48.743
has been taken under consideration.

34:49.254 --> 34:52.670
It is with great regret
that we cannot honour that request.

34:53.341 --> 34:55.831
Intergalactic treaty clearly specifies

34:56.011 --> 34:59.545
that no being can be extradited
without due process.

34:59.723 --> 35:01.549
In view of the circumstances,
we have no doubt

35:01.725 --> 35:03.433
that after a hearing at starbase,

35:03.601 --> 35:06.271
Commissioner Bele will be permitted
to retain his prisoner,

35:06.438 --> 35:07.932
and will be provided transportation..."

35:08.106 --> 35:10.099
That's enough. Thank you.

35:12.235 --> 35:16.399
As always,
Lokai has managed to gain allies.

35:16.573 --> 35:17.853
Now, wait a minute, commissioner.

35:18.033 --> 35:20.606
Even if they don't recognise
themselves as being such.

35:21.453 --> 35:25.201
Yes, he will evade,
delay and escape again,

35:25.373 --> 35:26.571
and in the process,

35:26.750 --> 35:30.166
put thousands of innocent beings
at each other's throats,

35:30.337 --> 35:31.499
getting them to kill and maim

35:31.671 --> 35:33.463
for a cause
which they have no stake in,

35:33.632 --> 35:36.668
but which he will force them
to violently espouse

35:36.843 --> 35:39.050
by twisting their minds with his lies,

35:39.221 --> 35:44.807
his loathsome accusations
and his foul threats.

35:44.976 --> 35:48.476
I can assure you, commissioner,
that our minds will not be twisted.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.473
Not by Lokai, nor by you.

35:52.150 --> 35:56.148
It is obvious to the most simpleminded
that Lokai is of an inferior breed.

35:56.321 --> 35:59.322
The obvious visual evidence,
commissioner,

35:59.491 --> 36:02.741
is that he is of the same breed
as yourself.

36:03.662 --> 36:06.663
Are you blind, Commander Spock?
Well, look at me.

36:09.126 --> 36:11.165
Look at me.

36:11.336 --> 36:14.005
You're black on one side
and white on the other.

36:14.172 --> 36:16.414
I am black on the right side.

36:20.971 --> 36:25.384
- I fail to see the significant difference.
- Lokai is white on the right side.

36:25.559 --> 36:27.765
All of his people
are white on the right side.

36:33.442 --> 36:36.645
Commissioner, perhaps the experience
of my own planet Vulcan

36:36.820 --> 36:39.691
may set an example of some value
to you.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.023
Vulcan was in danger
of being destroyed

36:42.200 --> 36:44.656
by the same conditions
and characteristics

36:44.828 --> 36:46.868
which threatened to destroy Cheron.

36:47.039 --> 36:50.657
We were once a people
like yourselves, wildly emotional,

36:50.834 --> 36:54.333
often committed
to irrationally-opposing points of view,

36:54.504 --> 36:57.920
leading, of course,
to death and destruction.

36:58.091 --> 37:01.543
Only the discipline of logic
saved my planet from extinction.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.879
Commander Spock, I am delighted
that Vulcan was saved,

37:05.057 --> 37:07.726
but you cannot expect Lokai
and people like him

37:07.893 --> 37:09.767
to act with self-discipline,

37:09.937 --> 37:11.680
any more than you can expect
a planet

37:11.855 --> 37:14.346
to stop orbiting its sun.

37:14.524 --> 37:18.854
Let Lokai state his grievances.
Hear him. Listen to him.

37:19.029 --> 37:20.060
Maybe he can change.

37:20.239 --> 37:22.694
- Maybe he wants to change.
- They cannot change.

37:22.866 --> 37:26.484
Change is the essential process
of all existence.

37:26.662 --> 37:30.742
For instance, the people of Cheron
must have once been mono-coloured.

37:32.501 --> 37:34.161
You mean like both of you?

37:34.336 --> 37:38.203
There must have been a time
long ago no doubt when that was true.

37:38.757 --> 37:40.168
Excuse me.

37:42.052 --> 37:44.460
- Kirk here.
- We're orbiting Ariannus, sir.

37:44.638 --> 37:45.669
Very good.

37:45.848 --> 37:47.721
Commence decontamination
procedures when ready.

37:47.891 --> 37:51.889
- Advise when complete.
- At once, sir. Scott out.

37:53.689 --> 37:55.563
I once heard
that on some of your planets,

37:55.733 --> 38:00.110
people believe they are descended
from apes.

38:00.821 --> 38:04.569
The actual theory
is that all life forms evolved

38:04.742 --> 38:09.035
from the lower levels
to the more advanced stages.

38:11.457 --> 38:13.034
Ready for
decontamination procedure.

38:13.208 --> 38:14.916
- Ready, sir.
- Ready here.

38:15.085 --> 38:16.164
Ready, Mr. Scott.

38:16.337 --> 38:20.880
Mr. Sulu, lock into coordinates
requested by Ariannus.

38:21.050 --> 38:22.544
Locked in, sir.

38:22.718 --> 38:26.585
Mr. Chekov,
position tanks for spray release.

38:26.764 --> 38:27.795
Tanks positioned.

38:28.265 --> 38:31.800
Lieutenant Uhura, advise Ariannus
the mission is to begin on signal.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.970
All ground precautions
must be ready.

38:36.398 --> 38:39.020
Ariannus says go ahead.

38:40.319 --> 38:41.897
Well, let her rip.

39:11.851 --> 39:14.139
- Scott to Captain Kirk.
- Kirk here.

39:14.311 --> 39:15.687
First run complete, sir.

39:15.855 --> 39:17.598
Good. Repeat procedure
for maximum effect.

39:17.773 --> 39:19.232
Aye, sir.

39:19.692 --> 39:22.017
Ready to repeat
decontamination procedure.

39:22.194 --> 39:23.819
Ready, sir.

39:23.988 --> 39:25.363
- Mr. Sulu?
- Ready here.

39:41.589 --> 39:43.416
- Kirk here.
- We're completing the final orbit

39:43.591 --> 39:44.622
of Ariannus, sir.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.470
I'm awaiting instructions to set course
for the next destination.

39:47.636 --> 39:49.047
Very good. We'll be right up.

39:49.221 --> 39:51.891
Set directional controls
for Starbase 4.

39:52.058 --> 39:53.552
Kirk out.

39:56.604 --> 39:58.976
Will you join us on the Bridge?

39:59.148 --> 40:01.769
There is nothing I would like more.

40:05.446 --> 40:08.233
Captain's log, stardate 5730.7.

40:08.407 --> 40:10.115
Having completed our mission
to Ariannus,

40:10.284 --> 40:13.071
the Enterprise
is now on course to Starbase 4.

40:13.245 --> 40:14.574
The crew is on normal routine

40:14.747 --> 40:17.499
and we are proceeding
without incident.

40:18.084 --> 40:19.827
Trouble, Mr. Chekov?

40:20.002 --> 40:22.410
I don't rightly know, Mr. Spock.

40:22.588 --> 40:24.960
I was trying to program for Starbase 4
as ordered.

40:25.132 --> 40:29.426
- I can't get a response.
- It just seemed to go dead, sir.

40:32.306 --> 40:34.215
Captain, some of the memory banks
of the computer

40:34.392 --> 40:36.717
- are burned out.
- Can you determine which ones?

40:36.894 --> 40:39.765
The directional control
and the self-destruct, captain,

40:39.939 --> 40:42.015
are both burnt out.

40:42.191 --> 40:44.267
I did it like this.

41:12.847 --> 41:16.050
Captain's log, stardate 5730.6.

41:16.225 --> 41:19.429
In a deliberate act of sabotage,
Commissioner Bele has burnt out

41:19.604 --> 41:22.355
our destruct mechanism
and, through the power of his will,

41:22.523 --> 41:24.730
has again taken over
directional control

41:24.901 --> 41:26.478
of the Enterprise.

41:26.652 --> 41:30.864
Now can we go to Cheron
without any more discussion?

41:33.201 --> 41:35.906
At the moment,
I seem to have no choice.

41:36.079 --> 41:37.822
So this is justice after Ariannus.

41:39.332 --> 41:41.159
You have signed my death warrant.

41:41.334 --> 41:43.623
I warned you what to expect.

41:43.795 --> 41:47.045
Will you continue
to let this mockery of justice go on?

41:47.215 --> 41:50.465
If you are partisans of justice, prove it.
Kill him!

41:50.635 --> 41:52.924
We are not killers.

41:53.096 --> 41:55.503
So, what do you do?
Carry justice on your tongues?

41:55.682 --> 41:57.923
You will beg for it,
but you won't fight or die for it.

41:58.101 --> 41:59.678
After so many years
of leading the fight,

41:59.852 --> 42:01.311
you seem very much alive.

42:01.479 --> 42:04.682
I doubt that the same can be said
for many of his followers.

42:04.857 --> 42:06.056
You're finished, Lokai.

42:06.234 --> 42:09.817
Oh, we've got your kind
penned in on Cheron,

42:09.988 --> 42:12.360
and it's not going to change.

42:12.532 --> 42:15.319
You've combed the galaxy, and
come up with mono-coloured trash,

42:15.493 --> 42:19.787
do-gooders and bleeding hearts.
You're dead, you half-white.

42:19.956 --> 42:23.372
You useless pieces of bland flesh.

42:24.502 --> 42:27.752
I'll take you with me, you half-black.

42:29.924 --> 42:33.969
Bele, you keep this up and you'll never
get to Cheron with your prisoner.

42:34.554 --> 42:36.926
The Bridge of this ship
will be irreparably damaged.

42:37.098 --> 42:39.055
This'll be your final battlefield.

42:39.225 --> 42:43.804
Your 50,000 years of pursuit
will have been wasted.

42:47.484 --> 42:53.070
And you, Lokai,
will die here in space.

42:53.239 --> 42:57.403
You'll inspire no more disciples.
Your cause will be ended.

42:57.577 --> 43:01.906
Remember, captain,
political sanctuary is my right.

43:02.624 --> 43:04.248
I am your prisoner.

43:04.417 --> 43:08.996
Honour that right or the fight will go on,
and your ship will burn up.

43:09.714 --> 43:10.745
You've made your point.

43:10.924 --> 43:13.925
If you listen to his legalistic trickery,
I shall have to destroy this ship

43:14.094 --> 43:15.671
and everybody aboard.

43:15.845 --> 43:17.885
I understand.

43:18.056 --> 43:21.555
Will you return the Enterprise
to my control?

43:30.902 --> 43:32.444
Why not?

43:44.291 --> 43:47.126
Scotty, have repairs on
directional control been completed?

43:47.294 --> 43:49.251
Aye, sir. Rerouted.

43:49.421 --> 43:52.256
Check controls and coordinates.

43:52.424 --> 43:53.586
Controls operating, captain.

43:53.758 --> 43:55.668
The Enterprise is responding
as always.

43:55.844 --> 43:58.465
- Captain, it's beautiful.
- Locking on to coordinates.

43:58.638 --> 44:02.054
Captain, we are within scanning range
of Cheron.

44:05.437 --> 44:06.635
Is it within visual range?

44:06.813 --> 44:09.138
Coming within visual range now,
captain.

44:09.316 --> 44:11.474
Chekov, put it on the screen.
Extreme magnification.

44:18.158 --> 44:23.614
- What are you picking up?
- Several very large cities. Uninhabited.

44:24.372 --> 44:28.619
Extensive traffic systems
barren of traffic.

44:28.794 --> 44:33.752
Lower animals and vegetation
encroaching on the cities.

44:33.924 --> 44:37.589
No sapient life forms
registering at all, captain.

44:38.011 --> 44:40.134
There is no evidence
of natural disaster,

44:40.305 --> 44:44.089
yet there are vast numbers
of unburied corpses in all cities.

44:44.267 --> 44:46.011
You mean,

44:47.062 --> 44:49.304
all the people are dead?

44:50.857 --> 44:52.268
All dead, captain.

44:52.442 --> 44:56.357
They have annihilated each other
totally.

44:57.239 --> 45:01.189
My people, all dead?

45:01.368 --> 45:04.488
Yes, commissioner. All of them.

45:05.080 --> 45:08.531
- No one alive?
- None at all, sir.

45:10.043 --> 45:14.123
Your band of murderers did this!

45:14.298 --> 45:17.168
Your genocidal maniacs did this!

45:17.342 --> 45:19.668
Stop it!
What's the matter with you two?

45:19.845 --> 45:22.881
Didn't you hear Spock?
Your planet is dead.

45:23.390 --> 45:26.676
There's nobody alive on Cheron
because of hate.

45:26.852 --> 45:29.722
The cause you fought about
no longer exists.

45:29.897 --> 45:32.566
Give yourselves time to breathe.
Give up your hate.

45:33.942 --> 45:36.860
You're welcome to live with us.

45:37.404 --> 45:39.147
Listen to me.

45:39.323 --> 45:45.159
You both must end up dead
if you don't stop hating.

45:45.621 --> 45:48.290
You're an idealistic dreamer.

45:52.753 --> 45:54.580
Bele.

45:56.215 --> 46:00.758
- The chase is finished.
- He must not escape me.

46:00.928 --> 46:02.920
Where can he go?

46:10.604 --> 46:12.264
Bele.

46:12.439 --> 46:13.850
Shall I alert security, sir?

46:15.025 --> 46:16.934
No, lieutenant.

46:17.778 --> 46:19.058
Where can they run?

46:38.132 --> 46:41.298
Captain, I have located them
on ship sensors.

46:41.468 --> 46:47.304
Bele is chasing Lokai on Deck 3.

47:04.825 --> 47:09.986
Bele is passing Recreation Room 3,
approaching the crewmen's lounge.

47:10.497 --> 47:13.582
Lokai is running past
the crewmen's lounge.

47:28.432 --> 47:30.840
Lokai has just arrived on Deck 5.

47:51.872 --> 47:54.363
Passing Recreation Room 3.

48:05.678 --> 48:08.513
Captain, someone has activated
the transporter mechanism.

48:08.681 --> 48:10.305
Spock,
anyone in the Transporter Room?

48:10.474 --> 48:12.882
Negative, captain.
Transporter Room is clear.

48:13.060 --> 48:18.221
However, there is a life form
materialising on the planet.

48:19.734 --> 48:22.225
It is Lokai.

48:22.403 --> 48:24.312
He's back on Cheron.

48:24.488 --> 48:27.904
There's nobody there to try him.
His judges are all dead.

48:41.756 --> 48:44.507
Captain, the transporter mechanism
has been activated again.

48:46.385 --> 48:48.758
- Of course.
- It is Bele, captain.

48:58.147 --> 49:02.394
And another life form
has appeared on Cheron.

49:09.075 --> 49:11.067
It doesn't make any sense.

49:13.538 --> 49:16.029
To expect sense
from two mentalities

49:16.207 --> 49:20.620
of such extreme viewpoints
is not logical.

49:20.795 --> 49:23.712
But their planet's dead.
Does it matter now which one's right?

49:23.881 --> 49:29.089
Not to Lokai and Bele.
All that matters to them is their hate.

49:29.262 --> 49:31.634
Do you suppose
that's all they ever had, sir?

49:31.806 --> 49:33.597
No.

49:34.684 --> 49:37.519
But that's all they have left.

49:37.687 --> 49:44.188
Warp factor 2, Mr. Sulu.
Set course for Starbase 4.
