00:02.000 --> 00:03.999
Andi:
<i> Previously, on</i> Andi Mack...

00:03.999 --> 00:04.999
-(screams)
-Whoa!

00:04.999 --> 00:07.999
Sorry, I haven't figured out
the brakes yet.

00:07.999 --> 00:08.999
Both:
Andi?

00:08.999 --> 00:09.999
(laughs)

00:09.999 --> 00:10.999
Whoa!

00:11.999 --> 00:13.876
Bex?

00:13.876 --> 00:14.999
Hey, Andi Mack!

00:14.999 --> 00:16.999
You guys! It's my sister!

00:16.999 --> 00:17.999
What are you doing here?

00:17.999 --> 00:19.999
I couldn't miss your birthday.

00:19.999 --> 00:21.334
How long will you be staying?

00:21.334 --> 00:22.501
A while?

00:22.501 --> 00:24.999
I'm... moving back home.

00:24.999 --> 00:26.999
<i> Andi never sees
what's inside this box.</i>

00:26.999 --> 00:29.501
-It's just pictures.
-It's secrets.

00:29.501 --> 00:30.999
Bex:
<i> He's gonna teach you
how to play Frisbee.</i>

00:30.999 --> 00:32.999
-Yep.
-It's Jonah Beck.

00:32.999 --> 00:33.999
I got you a lesson,
that's your present.

00:33.999 --> 00:35.167
-No...
-Yeah!

00:35.167 --> 00:36.999
I love that you have groupies.

00:36.999 --> 00:39.999
-This is Amber.
-His girlfriend.

00:39.999 --> 00:40.999
I have to go.

00:40.999 --> 00:42.334
I've been there,
and I know how you feel.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.999
No, you don't!

00:43.999 --> 00:46.000
I'm not one of those people
in your memory box!

00:46.000 --> 00:47.999
Those are the people
you know!

00:47.999 --> 00:49.999
Do you think
that you're not in here?

00:49.999 --> 00:52.999
Andi... I'm not your sister.

00:52.999 --> 00:53.999
I'm your mother.

00:59.999 --> 01:00.999
-What?
-What?

01:00.999 --> 01:02.876
-Oh my gosh!
-No way!

01:02.876 --> 01:04.709
Both:
You joined the Frisbee team?

01:04.709 --> 01:06.709
Uh... yeah.

01:06.709 --> 01:07.999
Do you even know
how to play Frisbee?

01:07.999 --> 01:08.999
I'm learning.

01:08.999 --> 01:10.000
From who?

01:10.000 --> 01:11.999
-Jonah Beck.
-Jonah Beck?

01:11.999 --> 01:13.709
-(makes exploding sounds)
-Get out!

01:13.709 --> 01:14.999
Are you literally saying

01:14.999 --> 01:17.334
that Jonah Beck
is literally teaching you
how to play Frisbee?

01:17.334 --> 01:19.000
But, it's not that big a deal.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.999
Uh, it's the biggest thing
that's ever happened to me,

01:20.999 --> 01:22.999
and it didn't even happen
to me!

01:22.999 --> 01:25.709
I know you, Andi Mack.
You're dying inside,

01:25.709 --> 01:26.999
but you don't want us
to see it.

01:26.999 --> 01:29.501
Well, too bad!
Because guess what?

01:29.501 --> 01:30.167
We can!

01:30.167 --> 01:32.000
You have no secrets from us.

01:35.000 --> 01:37.167
Okay... guys?

01:40.876 --> 01:43.167
You know me too well.

So what happened?

02:38.999 --> 02:40.999
Did you tell Buffy and Cyrus?

02:40.999 --> 02:41.999
No.

02:41.999 --> 02:42.999
Andi.

02:42.999 --> 02:46.709
I tried! But I only got
to the part about you know who.

02:46.709 --> 02:47.334
Who?

02:47.334 --> 02:48.501
(whispering)
Jonah?

02:48.501 --> 02:49.999
Why is there a part
about Jo--

02:50.999 --> 02:52.000
--know-who?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.999
Because! I had to tell them
the whole story.

02:54.999 --> 02:56.876
It's not like you
can start a conversation

02:56.876 --> 02:57.999
with, "Oh, hey, guys,
guess what?

02:57.999 --> 02:59.999
My sister's my mother,
and my mother's
my grandmother."

02:59.999 --> 03:01.999
Celia:
<i> I'm not your grandmother!</i>

03:01.999 --> 03:03.000
She doesn't wanna use that word.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.999
What word should I use, then?

03:04.999 --> 03:05.999
Nana?

03:05.999 --> 03:06.999
Celia:
<i> No!</i>

03:06.999 --> 03:09.709
Okay, well, what do you want me
to call you?

03:09.709 --> 03:11.999
Uh... how about Pops?

03:11.999 --> 03:13.999
Pops... I like it.

03:13.999 --> 03:15.709
Me, too.

03:15.709 --> 03:18.334
See? Change doesn't have
to be hard.

03:18.334 --> 03:20.501
But I get it,
it's complicated.

03:20.501 --> 03:22.167
Complicated? Buffy and Cyrus

03:22.167 --> 03:24.999
can barely comprehend
that I'm playing
an after-school sport.

03:24.999 --> 03:27.876
You're playing
an after-school sport?

03:27.876 --> 03:29.999
Why do people find this
so shocking?

03:29.999 --> 03:31.999
Who's hungry?

03:31.999 --> 03:33.999
Me.

03:33.999 --> 03:36.334
It is so great
to have you home.

03:36.334 --> 03:38.999
The-- The whole family
under one roof.

03:38.999 --> 03:39.999
It's been too long.

03:39.999 --> 03:42.167
And it feels really great
to have everything out
in the open.

03:42.167 --> 03:43.999
Finally.

03:43.999 --> 03:45.334
Wonderful.

03:45.334 --> 03:47.167
Well, it feels great for me.

03:47.167 --> 03:50.334
This is my first family dinner
as your mom.

03:50.334 --> 03:51.999
Albany.

03:51.999 --> 03:53.999
Albany. I don't know
what that means.

03:53.999 --> 03:55.999
-Annapolis.
-Atlanta.

03:55.999 --> 03:58.999
-Okay, that's not helping.
-We play memory games at dinner.

03:58.999 --> 04:01.999
-Augusta.
Pass the meat, please.

04:01.999 --> 04:05.167
-Austin.
-Dibs on the drumstick.
Baton Rouge.

04:05.167 --> 04:08.999
Memory games
at dinner, Mom?
Are you serious?

04:08.999 --> 04:11.167
The games were my idea.

04:11.167 --> 04:14.999
And I hope you are serious,
'cause they're so fun.

04:14.999 --> 04:18.709
-Can I play?
-Sure. We're listing
state capitals.

04:18.709 --> 04:19.999
Phoenix!

04:19.999 --> 04:21.999
In alphabetical order.

04:21.999 --> 04:23.999
-Where were we?
-Baton Rouge.

04:23.999 --> 04:24.999
Baton Rouge, okay.

04:24.999 --> 04:26.999
Um... can I have a minute?

04:26.999 --> 04:28.999
No. You missed, you're out.

04:28.999 --> 04:31.501
Oh, come on.
Give me a second chance.

04:31.501 --> 04:33.000
I already did.

04:33.000 --> 04:36.999
You guys are taking all the fun
out of learning at dinner.

04:38.999 --> 04:42.999
Yeah. Whoo!

04:42.999 --> 04:44.167
Come on, Michael.

04:44.167 --> 04:46.876
Yes.

04:46.876 --> 04:48.999
Your backhand's lookin'
tight, Andiman.

04:48.999 --> 04:50.999
-It is?
-Just needs some distance.

04:50.999 --> 04:51.999
Let me see your grip.

04:53.167 --> 04:54.999
(giggles)

04:56.999 --> 04:58.334
Allergies.

04:59.999 --> 05:00.999
Try this.

05:01.999 --> 05:04.709
Nice. I want one of these...

05:04.709 --> 05:05.999
whadaya-call-them? Wraps?

05:05.999 --> 05:07.999
But, they're spendy.

05:07.999 --> 05:10.999
I know, which is crazy,
because they're super easy
to make.

05:10.999 --> 05:13.000
Wait-- Seriously?
You made this?

05:13.000 --> 05:16.334
Yeah. I could make you one.
Oh... if you want.

05:16.334 --> 05:17.999
Dude, and it'll go around
a bunch of times?

05:17.999 --> 05:19.999
Yeah, as many
as you want.

05:21.999 --> 05:25.000
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Excuse me.

05:26.999 --> 05:29.000
What are you guys doing here?

05:29.000 --> 05:31.999
We are supporting you
in your thrilling new endeavor.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.999
Talking to Jonah Beck.

05:33.999 --> 05:34.999
And Frisbee.

05:34.999 --> 05:37.000
But more, talking
to Jonah Beck.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.501
It looks like
you've gotten really good at it.

05:40.999 --> 05:41.999
He's coming over.

05:41.999 --> 05:42.999
What?

05:42.999 --> 05:44.167
Oh, I'm so nervous.

05:44.167 --> 05:46.167
Hey, friends of Andi.

05:46.167 --> 05:47.999
Hey, Jonah Beck.

05:47.999 --> 05:50.000
You can just call me Jonah.

05:50.000 --> 05:51.167
Did you hear that?

05:51.167 --> 05:52.999
Jonah Beck just said
we could call him Jonah.

05:52.999 --> 05:57.999
Don't listen to Cyrus Goodman.
And this is Buffy Driscoll.

05:57.999 --> 05:59.876
You guys look like disc heads.

05:59.876 --> 06:01.334
What did you just call us?

06:01.334 --> 06:03.999
Disc... heads.

06:03.999 --> 06:05.999
People who play Ultimate?

06:05.999 --> 06:08.000
Which they don't.
Ever. Want to.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.876
Right?

06:09.876 --> 06:11.167
Not if that's the team shirt.

06:11.167 --> 06:13.709
I-- I'm more of a wheezer
than a runner.

06:13.709 --> 06:14.999
-But I'm happy to be a fan.
-Excellent.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.709
You're our first one.

06:16.709 --> 06:17.999
Wanna stick around
for practice?

06:17.999 --> 06:19.000
Sure, Jonah.

06:20.999 --> 06:23.999
(mouthing)
Jonah... Beck!

06:28.999 --> 06:32.999
The biggest surprise for me...
he's just so down to earth.

06:32.999 --> 06:35.167
He's got that
Bill Clinton charm.

06:35.167 --> 06:36.999
What does that mean?

06:36.999 --> 06:38.999
I don't know.
But it's something our new rabbi

06:38.999 --> 06:41.167
has in spaces, according
to my mother.

06:41.167 --> 06:45.999
Honestly, I say you have a shot.
Go for it. He clearly likes you,

06:45.999 --> 06:47.709
and doesn't seem
to have a girlfriend.

06:47.709 --> 06:49.999
Oh no, he does.

06:49.999 --> 06:52.000
You've never seen her,
'cause she's in ninth grade.

06:52.000 --> 06:54.999
He has a girlfriend
in high school?

06:54.999 --> 06:57.501
Sometimes she shows up
at the end of practice.

06:57.501 --> 07:01.000
An older woman.
I can't believe
he walks among us.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.999
And, here she comes now.

07:03.999 --> 07:07.999
<i> ♪ Be all about it
That's right
'cause it feels good ♪</i>

07:07.999 --> 07:10.999
She's... pretty.

07:10.999 --> 07:12.167
Her name's Amber.

07:12.167 --> 07:13.999
She looks like an Amber.

07:13.999 --> 07:15.999
She actually
looks... Amber.

07:15.999 --> 07:19.999
<i> ♪ Be all about it
That's right
'Cause it feels good ♪</i>

07:19.999 --> 07:21.999
-Hi!
-Hi, Amber.

07:28.167 --> 07:30.999
Now I know what it feels like
to be a window.

07:30.999 --> 07:31.999
Not good.

07:36.999 --> 07:41.999
Look away. Like, over here.
Where that's not happening.

07:47.999 --> 07:50.167
Do you think
she's always looked like that?

07:50.167 --> 07:52.999
Or, is that what happens
when you go to high school?

07:52.999 --> 07:55.000
I don't know, but lately
I've wondered,

07:55.000 --> 07:57.999
what if awkward
isn't just a phase?

07:57.999 --> 08:00.876
Question: Is this a snack
or an art supply?

08:00.876 --> 08:01.999
Does it still bend?

08:03.876 --> 08:04.000
No.

08:06.709 --> 08:08.334
What are you doing?

08:09.709 --> 08:12.000
And it better not be
making that bracelet for Jonah.

08:12.000 --> 08:16.876
-Why not?
-Because! If anyone's
making anything for Jonah Beck,

08:16.876 --> 08:17.999
it's going to be Tiffany.

08:17.999 --> 08:20.000
-Amber.
-That's what I said.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.334
Look, I just enjoy
making bracelets,
and he asked me for one.

08:23.334 --> 08:24.334
That's all this is.

08:24.334 --> 08:27.999
Lie to yourself all you want,
but you can't lie to me.

08:27.999 --> 08:30.999
And you know what?
I'm not gonna let you
lie to yourself, either.

08:30.999 --> 08:34.167
Buffy, I swear,
this means nothing!

08:34.167 --> 08:36.501
You are in such denial.

08:36.501 --> 08:37.999
Cyrus.

08:37.999 --> 08:39.167
Cyrus!

08:39.167 --> 08:40.709
Wha?

08:40.709 --> 08:41.999
Back me up here?

08:41.999 --> 08:43.999
I... found something.

08:43.999 --> 08:45.999
I'm sorry.
I was just looking
for some candy

08:45.999 --> 08:46.999
that
wasn't shellacked, and--

08:46.999 --> 08:50.999
Cyrus! Put that down,
that's private!

08:50.999 --> 08:52.999
Okay...

08:53.999 --> 08:55.999
But... I already know.

08:55.999 --> 08:56.999
Know what?

09:01.999 --> 09:04.999
When... did you find out?

09:04.999 --> 09:06.999
Couple days ago.

09:06.999 --> 09:08.999
It must be so strange for you.

09:09.999 --> 09:11.167
It is.

09:11.167 --> 09:15.999
Your sister...
has a secret baby?

09:17.999 --> 09:19.999
Yes.

09:21.999 --> 09:23.999
Yes, she-- she--
she does.

09:26.999 --> 09:28.999
But you can't say anything.

09:28.999 --> 09:31.999
This is private.
That box is like her diary.

09:32.999 --> 09:35.000
Nobody's allowed to look inside.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.999
Except... you.

09:36.999 --> 09:38.167
Including me.

09:38.167 --> 09:39.999
Wait... then why do you have it?

09:40.999 --> 09:43.999
Obviously, she's hiding it
from their mom.

09:43.999 --> 09:44.999
Obviously.

09:44.999 --> 09:46.999
This explains so much.

09:46.999 --> 09:48.999
Like, why she hardly
ever visits,

09:48.999 --> 09:50.999
and why she only stays
for a few days.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.999
Because she lives...

09:52.999 --> 09:55.999
Both:
with her secret baby!

09:56.999 --> 09:58.999
Sure.

09:58.999 --> 10:00.876
Why not?

10:03.709 --> 10:06.999
(machine whirring)

10:14.709 --> 10:15.876
Mom!

10:16.999 --> 10:18.501
Momma!

10:19.999 --> 10:21.167
You're in my bedroom.

10:22.000 --> 10:24.999
You're in my gym.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.167
It's six a.m.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.167
Gym opens early.

10:28.167 --> 10:31.334
I'm not even awake yet,
and we're already fighting.

10:31.334 --> 10:32.999
How is that possible?

10:32.999 --> 10:35.999
If it bothers you,
we don't have to talk.

10:35.999 --> 10:37.999
Oh, ever?

10:37.999 --> 10:39.999
I'm not the one
that's complaining.

10:42.999 --> 10:43.999
Can we try something?

10:43.999 --> 10:45.000
What?

10:48.999 --> 10:50.334
Can we try something?

10:54.501 --> 10:58.999
Let's try to say...
one nice thing to each other.

10:58.999 --> 11:00.999
You just gotta come up
with one.

11:00.999 --> 11:02.167
I'll go first.

11:02.167 --> 11:06.999
You did... a fantastic job
raising my daughter.

11:06.999 --> 11:11.876
And it's hard to admit,
but, probably a better job
than I would've done.

11:11.876 --> 11:13.167
And I'm grateful.

11:13.167 --> 11:14.999
Very, very grateful.

11:17.709 --> 11:20.999
I was gonna say...
I like how you do your makeup.

11:22.999 --> 11:25.000
That's a compliment.
And I'll take it.

11:26.999 --> 11:29.999
See? We can get along
if we want to.

11:29.999 --> 11:31.999
Yep, so it seems.

11:31.999 --> 11:35.501
What do you say?
You wanna try
for a second sentence?

11:35.501 --> 11:37.334
Let's not push our luck.

11:47.999 --> 11:50.999
Hey... can I talk to you
for a second?

11:50.999 --> 11:52.501
Is everything okay?

11:52.501 --> 11:54.876
I... did something bad.

12:03.999 --> 12:05.999
I took it.

12:05.999 --> 12:06.999
But I didn't look inside.

12:06.999 --> 12:10.999
I wanted to, but that would be
an invasion of your privacy.

12:10.999 --> 12:12.167
So that makes stealing it okay?

12:12.167 --> 12:14.999
No... I'm sorry.

12:15.999 --> 12:19.999
Andi...
if you wanna look through it...

12:19.999 --> 12:20.999
go ahead.

12:20.999 --> 12:21.999
Really?

12:26.000 --> 12:27.999
Wait, are you sure?

12:27.999 --> 12:29.709
Yes!

12:40.999 --> 12:42.501
He's not in here, is he?

12:42.501 --> 12:44.501
Your dad? No.

12:44.501 --> 12:46.999
I took him out.

12:46.999 --> 12:47.999
What?

12:47.999 --> 12:50.999
Because, I expected
you would invade my privacy.

12:50.999 --> 12:52.999
It's an honored tradition
in this house.

12:52.999 --> 12:55.000
I've had this box
since I was your age.

12:55.000 --> 12:58.167
Mom opened it once,
a little over 13 years ago.

12:58.167 --> 13:00.501
She saw something
she didn't wanna see.

13:00.501 --> 13:04.999
So she learned her lesson.
And... I learned mine.

13:04.999 --> 13:06.167
So... there is a picture.

13:06.167 --> 13:07.999
There is a picture.

13:07.999 --> 13:10.999
And you're not gonna
show it to me.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.999
How do you think
that makes me feel?

13:12.999 --> 13:16.334
Oh, I'm guessing as bad
as it feels that you haven't
told Buffy and Cyrus yet

13:16.334 --> 13:17.334
that I'm your mother.

13:17.334 --> 13:18.999
I'm getting there.

13:18.999 --> 13:21.501
In my experience,
this is a one-step process.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.999
Okay, I didn't snoop
inside your box, but they did,

13:24.999 --> 13:28.000
and they found the picture
of us, so they know
you had a baby...

13:28.000 --> 13:30.000
they just don't know
that it's me.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.999
Who do they think it is?

13:31.999 --> 13:33.999
Your secret baby?

13:33.999 --> 13:35.709
They think I have
a secret baby?

13:35.709 --> 13:37.999
Well, you do! Me!

13:37.999 --> 13:39.999
-Then tell them!
-It's not that easy!

13:39.999 --> 13:44.334
It took you 13 years,
and you still have secrets
you won't tell me.

13:44.334 --> 13:46.999
How long am I gonna
have to wait to hear those?

13:50.999 --> 13:52.501
Easy with the-- All right.

14:08.999 --> 14:12.709
Gus... that diving catch
you made today... phenomenal!

14:12.709 --> 14:13.999
I-- I did it for you, Jonah.

14:13.999 --> 14:14.999
And you made me proud.

14:14.999 --> 14:16.999
Ughh...

14:16.999 --> 14:18.999
Maybe stop by the emergency room
for a quick x-ray.

14:22.999 --> 14:24.999
What's up, Andiman?

14:24.999 --> 14:26.167
Um...

14:26.167 --> 14:28.501
Is-- Is--
Is that for me?

14:28.501 --> 14:30.999
You wanted one, right?

14:30.999 --> 14:33.999
Aw man... this is docious
ma-gocious, you made this?

14:33.999 --> 14:36.999
Uh, it was not that hard.

14:36.999 --> 14:39.876
Stop. You have a skill.

14:39.876 --> 14:41.999
Own it the way
I own Ultimate.

14:41.999 --> 14:43.999
How's it look?

14:43.999 --> 14:45.999
I think it looks good.

14:45.999 --> 14:50.167
Good? It's everything!
It slays.

14:50.167 --> 14:50.999
Thank you.

14:55.876 --> 14:56.999
You're welcome.

14:59.501 --> 15:03.999
(dramatic music playing)

15:06.709 --> 15:08.501
See you tomorrow.

15:08.501 --> 15:09.999
You rock, Andiman.

15:09.999 --> 15:10.999
I try.

15:22.167 --> 15:23.999
Amber?

15:23.999 --> 15:25.999
Oh, no, no...
don't look at me.

15:25.999 --> 15:27.167
Keep walking, you can't see me
like this.

15:27.167 --> 15:30.999
What's wrong?
Did something happen,
what was it?

15:30.999 --> 15:31.999
You.

15:31.999 --> 15:34.501
With your groupie pixie
dream girl.

15:34.501 --> 15:35.501
What?

15:35.501 --> 15:38.999
Don't lie.
I saw you, just now...

15:38.999 --> 15:40.876
holding her in your arms.

15:40.876 --> 15:41.167
Do you mean Andi?

15:41.167 --> 15:44.167
Please... I don't wanna
hear you say her name.

15:45.999 --> 15:47.999
It's like a knife in my heart.

15:50.999 --> 15:52.999
Am I losing you, Jonah?

15:52.999 --> 15:54.999
Of course not.

15:54.999 --> 15:56.999
Is this still
my special spot?

15:56.999 --> 15:58.709
You know it is.

16:01.999 --> 16:04.709
Is it still okay
for me to do this?

16:04.709 --> 16:05.999
Yeah.

16:07.999 --> 16:11.999
J plus A.

16:13.709 --> 16:16.999
This is nice.
Where'd you get it?

16:18.876 --> 16:22.709
Uh-- Uh-- Uh...

16:30.334 --> 16:31.999
Dinner! Andi!

16:33.501 --> 16:34.999
I'm here.

16:36.334 --> 16:38.334
Memory game. Are we playing?

16:38.334 --> 16:39.999
Why wouldn't we be?

16:42.709 --> 16:44.999
Andi, it's your turn
to start.

16:44.999 --> 16:47.999
Oh. Hydrogen.

16:47.999 --> 16:50.999
Hydrogen?
What is that the capital of?

16:50.999 --> 16:54.999
-Are you okay?
-Very much so,
thank you for asking.

16:55.999 --> 16:57.999
Helium.

16:57.999 --> 16:58.999
Uh, lithium.

16:58.999 --> 17:00.167
(laughing)

17:00.167 --> 17:01.999
What is going on?

17:01.999 --> 17:04.999
I just spent four hours
memorizing state capitals.

17:04.999 --> 17:06.999
Oh, tonight's
the periodic table.

17:07.999 --> 17:09.999
Andi? It's your turn.

17:09.999 --> 17:13.167
No, no... it's not.
It's... my turn.

17:13.167 --> 17:14.999
I'm here, I'm part
of this family,

17:14.999 --> 17:17.999
and I'm playing
the dinnertime memory game.

17:21.876 --> 17:22.999
Which is what again?

17:22.999 --> 17:24.999
Periodic elements
in order of their atomic number.

17:26.000 --> 17:27.501
And you said?

17:27.501 --> 17:28.999
Lithium.

17:28.999 --> 17:32.999
Oh, come on,
periodic table, I know
you're up in here somewhere.

17:34.999 --> 17:35.999
Beryllium?

17:35.999 --> 17:36.999
-Yes!
-Yes?

17:36.999 --> 17:37.999
-Uh-huh!
-I got it right?

17:37.999 --> 17:39.999
-Uh-huh!
-(laughing)

17:39.999 --> 17:41.709
You are still in the game.

17:44.334 --> 17:48.999
That's all I want...
is to still be in the game.

17:56.167 --> 17:58.999
<i> ♪ Orange peel
under the car seat ♪</i>

17:58.999 --> 18:01.999
<i> ♪ I can feel
underneath my feet ♪</i>

18:04.000 --> 18:05.999
Cyrus:
What do we know
about this secret baby?

18:05.999 --> 18:07.876
Is it a boy or a girl?

18:07.876 --> 18:09.999
How old is the secret baby now?

18:09.999 --> 18:11.999
Have you ever
met the secret baby?

18:11.999 --> 18:13.501
Cyrus:
Your mother must not
be too happy

18:13.501 --> 18:14.999
about the secret baby.

18:17.876 --> 18:20.709
Are you going to tell us
anything about the secret baby?

18:20.709 --> 18:22.999
Stop talking
about the secret baby!

18:22.999 --> 18:24.709
Why can't we talk
about the secret baby?

18:24.709 --> 18:26.999
Is there something wrong
with the secret baby?

18:26.999 --> 18:29.999
Please tell me
everything gonna be okay
with the secret baby.

18:29.999 --> 18:30.999
I'm the secret baby.

18:30.999 --> 18:33.999
Bex is my mother,
and my mother is my grandmother,

18:33.999 --> 18:37.999
and Amber
is wearing my bracelet!

18:40.334 --> 18:43.999
Buffy/Cyrus:
Amber is wearing your bracelet?

18:43.999 --> 18:45.999
I told you not to make it.

18:48.999 --> 18:52.709
(dramatic music playing)

18:56.999 --> 18:58.999
Why is she staring at you?

19:00.000 --> 19:03.709
I don't know. It's like
we're in some kind of contest.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.999
One that I do not
wanna be in.

19:05.999 --> 19:08.167
So, I'm just gonna stop.

19:08.167 --> 19:12.999
(dramatic music playing)

19:13.999 --> 19:16.709
She's really committed to this.

19:16.709 --> 19:18.167
I didn't like it when she looked
straight through me

19:18.167 --> 19:19.999
like I wasn't there.

19:22.999 --> 19:24.999
This... is much, much worse.

19:26.999 --> 19:28.334
She blinked!

19:28.334 --> 19:31.167
I didn't know
blinking was allowed,
I could've been blinking

19:31.167 --> 19:32.334
this whole time.

19:34.999 --> 19:37.999
What did I ever do to her?

19:37.999 --> 19:39.999
Besides apparently
make her a bracelet?

19:41.501 --> 19:43.709
That's it, that's what you did!

19:43.709 --> 19:45.999
You went after her man.

19:45.999 --> 19:47.334
No, I didn't!

19:47.334 --> 19:49.876
Th-- That bracelet
didn't mean anything!

19:49.876 --> 19:51.709
It was a craft project!

19:51.709 --> 19:53.999
Don't tell us. Tell her.

19:53.999 --> 19:55.999
She's still looking at me?

19:55.999 --> 19:57.999
(dramatic music playing)

19:57.999 --> 19:58.999
If looks could kill...

19:58.999 --> 20:02.334
and, I mean, I know
it's a cliche, but, seriously...

20:02.334 --> 20:03.999
be grateful looks can't kill.

20:06.999 --> 20:08.334
Then let's just get out of here.

20:08.334 --> 20:11.709
No! If you leave, she wins.

20:11.709 --> 20:13.999
We don't know that,
we don't know the rules.

20:13.999 --> 20:15.501
Blinking is allowed.

20:15.501 --> 20:17.999
Don't you get it?
She wants you gone.

20:17.999 --> 20:20.999
She thinks you're a threat.

20:20.999 --> 20:22.999
"Andi with the good hair."

20:22.999 --> 20:25.501
So, should I get
these baby taters to go
or not?

20:25.501 --> 20:27.999
Well, is she still staring
at me?

20:29.167 --> 20:33.999
Yep. Only now she's smiling
and waving buh-bye.

20:45.167 --> 20:47.999
Ooh, hey, could I get
some tartar sauce, please?

20:47.999 --> 20:48.999
Thanks.

20:52.999 --> 20:54.999
You're doing great.
I'm proud of you.

20:54.999 --> 20:56.999
Thanks.

20:56.999 --> 20:58.999
You said something
right before "Amber's wearing
my bracelet."

20:58.999 --> 21:00.999
What was it?

21:00.999 --> 21:02.999
I'm the secret baby.

21:02.999 --> 21:05.999
Right. Right.
I have some questions.

21:05.999 --> 21:06.999
Do you?

21:06.999 --> 21:08.501
One or two.

21:09.501 --> 21:12.999
(dramatic music playing)

21:19.999 --> 21:20.999
Andi:
<i> Next on</i> Andi Mack...

21:20.999 --> 21:23.999
Did Mom-- I mean,
did Celia say it was okay?

21:23.999 --> 21:25.999
It's okay to have a little fun.

21:25.999 --> 21:27.000
Plus we don't have to tell her.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.334
Things still weird at home?

21:28.334 --> 21:29.999
Two moms, one house,

21:29.999 --> 21:31.999
and they agree zero percent
of the time.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.167
I'm her mother!

21:33.167 --> 21:35.999
I was her mother...
and she was happy!

21:35.999 --> 21:36.999
No, she wasn't.

21:36.999 --> 21:38.334
If you get really scared,

21:38.334 --> 21:39.999
I'm gonna be right here
with you the whole time.

21:41.999 --> 21:43.999
I'm not sure
she's safe with you.

21:43.999 --> 21:45.999
(screaming)
