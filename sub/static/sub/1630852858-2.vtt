00:37.287 --> 00:38.747
Good morning.

00:40.248 --> 00:41.416
Good morning.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.095
Yesterday…

01:01.311 --> 01:04.105
Please don't look at me.

01:07.233 --> 01:08.276
What?

01:15.658 --> 01:19.496
There's nothing to eat.

01:26.878 --> 01:27.879
Yes, there is!

01:29.631 --> 01:30.924
It's ready.

01:31.007 --> 01:33.218
That looks good.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.136
Thanks.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.101
- Bon appétit.
- Thank you.

01:53.947 --> 01:54.781
It's good.

01:56.199 --> 01:59.202
- You really look like you enjoy it.
- Do I really?

02:19.013 --> 02:20.014
Excuse me.

02:25.478 --> 02:28.189
I've brought our latest Koso drink.

02:28.273 --> 02:31.109
I thought perhaps
you might stock a sample as a test.

02:32.110 --> 02:33.403
Why not get to the point?

02:34.154 --> 02:38.408
You want to use our brand strength
to sell your crappy drinks.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.077
I hate that.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.329
That kind of parasite,

02:43.413 --> 02:45.331
using another's strength
for one's own benefit.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.417
No, it's not like that at all.

02:50.378 --> 02:52.046
Then show me how serious you are.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.384
Here.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.221
If you drink it all, I'll stock it.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.058
It's delicious, right?

03:09.981 --> 03:11.107
I'll do it then.

03:25.288 --> 03:27.081
I can't believe you took me seriously.

03:38.676 --> 03:43.056
This is no good, isn't it?

03:44.349 --> 03:45.850
What are you two talking about?

03:46.976 --> 03:50.313
I was saying how much I can relax here.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.315
I'm glad to hear it.

03:56.945 --> 03:58.446
But I should be going back.

04:01.449 --> 04:05.411
I told you,
stay here until you feel better.

04:11.584 --> 04:13.127
What should we name this fish?

04:13.878 --> 04:14.754
Well…

04:17.715 --> 04:19.175
You don't name the goldfish?

04:19.676 --> 04:22.178
Not really, no.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.638
Really?

04:25.390 --> 04:27.600
Because it's so sad when they leave.

05:08.641 --> 05:10.643
Shimura, come here a sec.

05:14.188 --> 05:16.983
Here, Sato was dealing with this.
I want you to take it on.

05:17.066 --> 05:18.276
Huh?

05:18.359 --> 05:20.903
Sato's going
on maternity leave next month.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.531
I'll leave it to you then.

05:24.198 --> 05:25.992
Can I outsource this?

05:26.075 --> 05:29.746
We don't have money for outsourcing.
Find a way to do it in-house. Thanks.

05:30.955 --> 05:34.584
It'd be more efficient
to outsource it, idiot.

05:40.590 --> 05:41.924
NORIKO

05:42.008 --> 05:43.342
Did you see this?

05:46.846 --> 05:47.764
What?

05:49.849 --> 05:53.478
Hiraga's wife cheated on him and left.

05:54.062 --> 05:56.314
- Is this for real?
- It's her.

05:56.397 --> 05:57.648
ARTEMIS TOWER TSUKISHIMA BBS

05:57.732 --> 06:00.026
I'm so surprised! The Hiragas?

06:00.109 --> 06:02.820
And they looked like such a happy couple.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.156
You never know with infidelity.

06:05.239 --> 06:07.116
You never know.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.329
- I can't even imagine.
- I don't get it, either.

06:11.412 --> 06:16.667
It starts unexpectedly.
That's why you can't fight it.

06:16.751 --> 06:18.628
That's true.

06:19.670 --> 06:22.590
Mei, can I ask your advice
about the entrance exams?

06:22.673 --> 06:24.842
Of course. Come anytime.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.601
- Sorry to always have you help.
- No, not at all!

06:35.269 --> 06:37.313
Okay, that's everything.

06:37.396 --> 06:38.606
- Right.
- Thanks!

06:38.689 --> 06:40.608
No, thank you!

06:41.484 --> 06:43.152
- Hello.
- Hello.

06:43.653 --> 06:44.695
Who is this?

06:47.198 --> 06:50.076
- A part-time worker?
- Yes, that's right.

06:50.159 --> 06:53.621
Right. The festival season
is right around the corner,

06:53.704 --> 06:54.997
when you make the big bucks.

06:55.081 --> 06:56.958
Okay, until next time. Thanks!

06:57.041 --> 06:58.543
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

07:01.671 --> 07:03.422
- Shall we take a break?
- Yes.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.928
Would you like coffee or tea?

07:09.595 --> 07:10.429
Whichever you like.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.473
I'm asking you which do you prefer?

07:16.227 --> 07:18.646
Tea then.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.064
Got it.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.617
This is the only teapot I have.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.420
Would you really like
to work at the store?

07:42.503 --> 07:43.754
What?

07:43.838 --> 07:46.174
It gets pretty busy
during the festival season.

07:47.884 --> 07:50.094
- The goldfish scooping game?
- Right.

07:55.141 --> 07:56.142
Thanks.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.856
But I'll be leaving as soon as I can.

08:07.445 --> 08:08.654
I guess you will.

08:08.738 --> 08:09.739
Yeah.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.827
- Here.
- Thanks.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.209
I just don't get it.

08:21.292 --> 08:24.921
I can't believe someone would throw away
a life of luxury for an affair.

08:25.713 --> 08:29.717
Well, you have to make sure
no one sees that you're outsourcing.

08:30.968 --> 08:31.844
Outsourcing?

08:31.928 --> 08:34.055
Outsourcing of sex.

08:35.139 --> 08:39.185
If you can't do it with your husband,
then you have to outsource to another man.

08:39.268 --> 08:41.896
Don't tell me
you're thinking of outsourcing?

08:43.940 --> 08:45.274
Don't do it.

08:45.775 --> 08:49.445
So what if it's a sexless marriage?
You still get along with your husband.

08:50.571 --> 08:52.782
Yeah, we get along.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.370
But still, I want children.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.873
All the more reason not to outsource.

09:02.542 --> 09:04.252
That's true, but…

09:06.254 --> 09:11.842
I wonder if I'll spend the rest of my life
without being held like this.

09:13.177 --> 09:15.346
I told you, don't go there!

09:15.930 --> 09:17.223
You'll fall.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.225
You're gonna fall!

09:19.850 --> 09:21.102
It's fine, I'll fall.

09:22.270 --> 09:23.229
And you fell.

09:26.941 --> 09:28.734
- Minoru.
- Yeah?

09:30.444 --> 09:31.737
I want a baby.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.245
Here I come.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.164
Hey, wait a minute.

09:42.248 --> 09:44.875
Hey… I said wait a minute.

09:44.959 --> 09:47.461
Why? A baby! Sex!

09:47.545 --> 09:49.880
- It's too soon for a kid.
- What?

09:49.964 --> 09:53.759
Everyone's having kids these days,
and I understand wanting to join in.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.762
But we just bought this condo.

09:56.846 --> 09:59.807
And there's no way I can change jobs
to increase our income, right?

10:01.309 --> 10:03.436
That's true, but…

10:03.603 --> 10:07.940
Let's take it slow
and think about it. Okay?

10:13.696 --> 10:15.156
Now, I'll show you how it's done.

10:17.491 --> 10:19.327
The start is really important.

10:26.500 --> 10:27.752
What the hell?

10:29.754 --> 10:31.964
They're so firm and perky.

10:34.133 --> 10:37.178
Why doesn't he get aroused?

10:54.987 --> 10:55.821
JUN

10:55.905 --> 10:57.990
Stop ignoring my messages. It hurts.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.325
You're kidding me.

11:08.250 --> 11:09.794
What do you want?

11:12.046 --> 11:14.799
Do you have any time? Let's go eat.

11:18.344 --> 11:21.389
Are you so lonely
that you'll send that to an ex-girlfriend?

11:25.267 --> 11:26.310
SO LONELY

11:29.772 --> 11:32.024
JUN

11:36.112 --> 11:37.321
Minoru.

11:42.034 --> 11:42.952
Minoru!

11:54.755 --> 11:55.756
Hello?

11:56.507 --> 11:57.508
Yuka?

12:00.594 --> 12:01.887
It's been a while.

12:32.168 --> 12:34.295
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.175
Is it so hard on you that Sakura left?

12:39.842 --> 12:41.051
No way.

12:42.052 --> 12:44.472
The salon will keep doing business
as long as I'm there.

12:44.555 --> 12:47.850
With money, food can be managed somehow.

12:49.393 --> 12:52.396
So you don't care
if she doesn't come back?

12:52.897 --> 12:53.898
Yeah.

12:58.694 --> 13:02.740
But in the end, Sakura also got you good.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.452
Haven't you seen the BBS?

13:20.007 --> 13:25.221
APT 4501, SAKURA HIRAGA

13:38.984 --> 13:42.655
MESSAGES

14:05.886 --> 14:06.887
Um…

14:08.264 --> 14:10.558
Can I sleep here tonight?

14:11.809 --> 14:13.811
No, I'll sleep there.
You can use the bed--

14:13.894 --> 14:16.814
- But…
- It's pretty comfortable.

14:20.526 --> 14:23.112
All right. Thanks.

14:25.072 --> 14:25.990
Good night.

14:27.992 --> 14:29.076
Good night.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.502
How long have you been with your husband?

14:38.586 --> 14:40.421
Dated for one year, married for two.

14:42.464 --> 14:44.717
So you're at the stage
where you're tiring of him.

14:46.468 --> 14:48.554
You know a lot, being divorced.

14:48.637 --> 14:50.055
Nah.

14:50.139 --> 14:54.101
I told you,
that kind of boring guy is not for you.

14:54.184 --> 14:57.271
I chose a partner who doesn't
stress me out when we're together.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.863
I want a goldfish.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.781
What? A goldfish?

15:08.616 --> 15:10.409
No, it's nothing.

15:17.791 --> 15:18.876
What?

15:19.460 --> 15:22.046
You and your husband
aren't fucking, are you?

15:22.671 --> 15:25.007
Huh? Just stop.

15:25.716 --> 15:29.970
If you don't feel stress with someone,
it means that they're similar to you.

15:30.471 --> 15:34.266
People like that instinctively avoid
members of the opposite sex.

15:37.394 --> 15:38.771
Does your husband turn you on?

15:40.064 --> 15:41.148
He doesn't, right?

15:41.649 --> 15:44.234
You're saying a person
who irritates me would be better?

15:44.318 --> 15:45.819
Right. Like me.

15:47.696 --> 15:49.073
You just felt a thrill, right?

15:49.156 --> 15:50.991
You're as cute as always.

15:51.992 --> 15:53.869
You really piss me off.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.589
- Hey.
- What?

16:05.673 --> 16:07.800
Why did you contact me?

16:08.300 --> 16:09.468
Why?

16:11.762 --> 16:12.763
Why?

16:12.846 --> 16:14.223
I guess…

16:15.224 --> 16:16.058
Stop it!

16:30.823 --> 16:32.491
What do you think you're doing?

16:33.617 --> 16:34.535
Are you irritated?

16:37.162 --> 16:39.373
If so, it means I still turn you on.

16:39.915 --> 16:40.874
Jerk!

16:45.421 --> 16:47.047
Wanna take a short rest?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.342
Like, I would!

17:14.783 --> 17:16.952
TOYODA GOLDFISH

17:23.834 --> 17:25.002
Hello?

17:25.836 --> 17:28.630
I've decided to stock your stuff.

17:29.757 --> 17:30.591
Thank you!

17:31.258 --> 17:34.970
But I have a favor to ask.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.140
A favor?

17:54.531 --> 17:58.368
Someday, I'll have to go back.

18:09.421 --> 18:14.218
Someday, I'll have to let her go back.

18:20.849 --> 18:22.601
Minoru, the bath is…

18:40.119 --> 18:43.664
- MAY 21
- HIGH

19:01.765 --> 19:03.433
Hey, Minoru.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.603
Good night.

19:07.813 --> 19:09.022
Hey.

19:10.691 --> 19:11.984
Hey!

19:14.862 --> 19:17.239
Don't say good night.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.369
Just a minute, wait.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.290
No, wait. I said, wait a minute!

19:27.791 --> 19:29.001
Why?

19:30.669 --> 19:32.212
I'm not in the mood right now.

19:34.381 --> 19:36.508
Then when will you be in the mood?

19:42.598 --> 19:44.224
Let's just go to sleep.

19:44.308 --> 19:46.894
I have work tomorrow. Okay?

19:50.898 --> 19:51.940
Good night.

20:00.490 --> 20:01.742
Thank you.

20:02.409 --> 20:03.660
I'll mind the store.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.913
It's okay.
I'm going to lock up before I go.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.207
You're thinking too hard.

20:09.791 --> 20:13.086
I don't think he'll be looking for me.

20:15.130 --> 20:17.090
No matter who comes, don't open the door.

20:40.739 --> 20:42.366
CARE AND FEEDING OF FISH

20:45.661 --> 20:50.999
"When keeping a fish,
the most important thing is observation."

20:52.209 --> 20:54.920
Observation?

20:59.508 --> 21:01.969
They all look the same.

21:02.552 --> 21:04.638
Do you notice when one has symptoms?

21:12.020 --> 21:13.313
Open up, please!

21:25.492 --> 21:26.994
I know you're in there.

21:29.454 --> 21:30.622
Sakura!

21:48.181 --> 21:49.182
Excuse me.

21:55.022 --> 21:55.897
Um…

21:56.815 --> 21:59.693
I heard there was
a goldfish shop around here.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.446
Yes, it's mine.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.990
What a coincidence.

22:05.073 --> 22:07.576
It's just around the corner up ahead.
Shall I take you there?

22:07.659 --> 22:09.494
No, not today.

22:10.954 --> 22:12.664
I'll call again sometime.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.082
Please do.

22:29.306 --> 22:32.517
TOYODA GOLDFISH

22:37.064 --> 22:38.190
Sakura.

22:40.108 --> 22:41.068
Welcome back.

22:41.860 --> 22:42.736
What's wrong?

22:46.406 --> 22:47.407
Nothing.

22:56.583 --> 22:58.919
I didn't really know your size
or anything.

22:59.836 --> 23:02.547
Thank you. It's a big help.

23:04.382 --> 23:06.176
And this too.

23:10.388 --> 23:11.640
Go ahead and open it.

23:28.198 --> 23:30.283
It's so cute.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.829
I thought we couldn't have Western tea
from the little Japanese teapot.

23:39.084 --> 23:41.044
Did you want to choose one yourself?

23:41.128 --> 23:42.754
No, that's not it.

23:42.838 --> 23:44.923
I'm happy I can drink tea.

23:47.801 --> 23:51.263
At the house,
I had to go along with a coffee-lover.

23:54.391 --> 23:57.644
I never realized that being able
to drink what I like when I like…

23:59.938 --> 24:01.523
could make me so happy.

24:08.655 --> 24:09.656
Thank you.

24:09.739 --> 24:11.116
I'm glad.

24:19.040 --> 24:21.668
Mommy, look!

24:28.550 --> 24:29.551
MINORU

24:29.634 --> 24:32.304
Drinking with my boss.
I'll be late, no need to stay up.

24:38.101 --> 24:42.189
If there's something worrying you,
we can talk in my apartment.

24:45.609 --> 24:47.152
No, it's fine.

24:47.235 --> 24:50.572
I can see the universe in your body.

24:56.077 --> 24:58.455
Listen to that voice.

25:00.540 --> 25:03.418
You don't believe it?
But you know what they say?

25:04.836 --> 25:06.963
Once two bodies have touched…

25:12.552 --> 25:15.889
they don't want to separate again.

25:34.783 --> 25:35.742
JUN

25:35.825 --> 25:36.826
I want to see you.

25:53.009 --> 25:54.135
Sakura.

25:57.847 --> 25:58.848
Yes?

26:04.062 --> 26:06.731
- What is it?
- It's my little secret.

26:07.565 --> 26:10.652
Your little secret? What could it be?

26:11.945 --> 26:12.779
Good.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.326
Thank you.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.000
Wow!

26:25.709 --> 26:27.002
It's so beautiful.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.676
- That's pretty.
- Yeah, it is.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.181
Wow.

26:57.782 --> 26:59.617
- Let's shower.
- I did, at home.

26:59.701 --> 27:00.785
But I--

27:15.925 --> 27:18.887
This is great. Like VIP seats.

27:19.888 --> 27:22.640
When I was a kid,
my grandpa would let me climb a ladder,

27:22.724 --> 27:24.809
so we could watch
the fireworks here every year.

27:26.686 --> 27:28.188
The sound is incredible.

27:28.271 --> 27:30.106
- Is it too loud?
- No.

27:30.190 --> 27:35.278
You can hear it, smell it.
It really feels like fireworks.

27:41.826 --> 27:44.079
Hey, the fireworks are pretty.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.500
Hey!

27:50.335 --> 27:53.380
You can't hear them or smell them.

27:55.090 --> 27:57.717
It's better to just watch them on TV.

28:09.020 --> 28:13.191
I suppose it's even prettier
from the top floor.

28:31.209 --> 28:33.253
Wow! Look at this!

28:35.880 --> 28:38.341
Look at that. Goldfish fireworks.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.514
- I've never seen that in my life.
- Me neither.

28:44.597 --> 28:46.015
- Really?
- Yeah.

28:47.100 --> 28:48.184
It's beautiful.

29:19.549 --> 29:21.009
I haven't done this in so long.

29:21.092 --> 29:22.135
So what?

29:23.887 --> 29:25.472
Turn down the lights.

29:26.514 --> 29:27.557
No way.

29:43.198 --> 29:44.157
You're erect.

29:46.618 --> 29:47.994
You can put it in.

29:48.995 --> 29:51.122
You came here to feel good, didn't you?

29:52.373 --> 29:53.374
No, I didn't.

29:55.794 --> 29:57.128
Then why?

29:57.212 --> 29:58.713
I wanted to make sure.

29:59.297 --> 30:04.511
That there was still someone
aroused by my body.

30:43.299 --> 30:44.425
Jun…

30:49.055 --> 30:52.267
This is the last time.
We'll never meet again.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.246
Here.

31:13.329 --> 31:14.831
- This one.
- Already decided?

31:14.914 --> 31:15.915
Yup.

31:17.500 --> 31:18.501
Here we go!

31:20.962 --> 31:22.505
Cheers.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.345
- That's good.
- That's good.

31:39.731 --> 31:40.857
Awesome!

31:42.025 --> 31:43.359
This is the best!

31:44.277 --> 31:46.446
- Tamaya!
- Tamaya!

31:52.410 --> 31:54.954
- I told you, not that way!
- I know.

31:55.038 --> 31:56.331
You're gonna fall!

31:56.414 --> 31:57.874
It's okay.

31:59.709 --> 32:00.919
I'm not gonna fall.

32:03.671 --> 32:05.798
JUN

32:05.882 --> 32:06.966
Your phone's ringing.

32:07.550 --> 32:08.593
It's fine.

32:10.011 --> 32:11.095
Yeah, but--

32:11.179 --> 32:12.889
- Hey, Minoru.
- Yeah.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.183
I want to get a dog.

32:16.434 --> 32:18.353
- A dog?
- Yeah.

32:18.436 --> 32:20.188
This feng shui woman was saying

32:20.813 --> 32:24.609
that having a pet
is good to have a happy home.

32:27.987 --> 32:29.656
But you know I'm allergic, right?

32:43.544 --> 32:46.005
Maybe a goldfish after all.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.511
I didn't know there were yellow goldfish.

32:51.594 --> 32:55.056
Yes, they're a new type called "kirakira."

32:55.139 --> 32:57.350
They're so cute.

32:58.726 --> 33:00.687
Okay, I'll take this one.

33:00.770 --> 33:01.938
Thank you very much.

33:03.523 --> 33:04.732
What?

33:11.030 --> 33:12.156
Wait!

33:12.740 --> 33:15.910
I won't tell anyone.
Could we just talk a little?

33:24.752 --> 33:27.338
These goldfish are raised
with plenty of water,

33:28.589 --> 33:30.758
so they're all very energetic.

33:36.222 --> 33:40.059
This one is beautiful.

33:41.519 --> 33:42.854
That one's mine.

33:45.314 --> 33:47.358
Somehow, you've become brighter.

33:48.151 --> 33:48.985
What?

33:50.695 --> 33:53.031
It's the talk of the condo, you know.

33:53.114 --> 33:55.575
That Mr. Hiraga's wife
had an affair and left.

33:59.162 --> 34:00.872
Did you get divorced?

34:02.540 --> 34:04.375
It's not that easy.

34:04.459 --> 34:05.418
What?

34:07.128 --> 34:09.505
Because of the salon, and other things.

34:14.677 --> 34:16.596
I was really surprised to see you.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.639
Why are you here in this goldfish shop?

34:19.599 --> 34:22.602
The manager is certainly
a good-looking guy.

34:22.685 --> 34:23.770
Is it that good?

34:26.147 --> 34:28.024
The sex. You and him.

34:30.526 --> 34:32.111
It's not like that.

34:34.989 --> 34:36.199
Somehow…

34:38.284 --> 34:42.371
I just feel really comfortable
in this place.

34:48.920 --> 34:52.673
The other day, I cheated on my husband.

34:54.217 --> 34:57.929
What's more,
with the worst ex-boyfriend I ever had.

34:58.721 --> 35:02.517
He's so condescending
and always fooling around.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.312
I really hate him.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.492
Shouldn't you answer it?

35:23.454 --> 35:27.208
It was just that one time.
I won't see him anymore.

35:33.673 --> 35:37.385
Since you're more experienced,
what should I know about keeping goldfish?

35:42.014 --> 35:43.724
What's important…

36:00.825 --> 36:02.785
JUN
MISSED CALL

36:03.995 --> 36:05.872
CONTACTS - JUN

36:09.083 --> 36:11.252
DELETE CONTACT

36:16.132 --> 36:17.341
CONTACT DELETED

36:19.135 --> 36:20.887
Now it's finished.

36:24.974 --> 36:25.892
Yuka.

36:32.940 --> 36:34.108
How?

36:35.193 --> 36:37.862
Did you already buy a goldfish?

36:38.446 --> 36:39.488
What are you doing?

36:39.572 --> 36:40.781
What the hell?

36:40.865 --> 36:43.451
You said you wanted a goldfish,
so I came here to buy one.

36:44.827 --> 36:48.206
You know, like coaxing
a pet back in with food.

36:50.416 --> 36:52.168
I'd already decided on a name.

36:53.377 --> 36:54.712
Yuka.

36:56.255 --> 36:57.506
Cute, don't you think?

36:59.258 --> 37:00.384
Stop it.

37:02.511 --> 37:05.473
What's wrong with giving it
the name of the girl I love?

37:17.860 --> 37:19.445
What's important…

37:22.365 --> 37:24.325
is close observation.

37:31.832 --> 37:34.752
When you notice the symptoms of a disease,

37:36.462 --> 37:38.589
it's often already too late.

38:02.947 --> 38:04.573
Why are you hiding her?

38:10.913 --> 38:14.125
I'm telling you,
I'm here to talk with Sakura Hiraga.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.626
There's no one here by that name.

38:16.544 --> 38:17.545
She's not here.

38:19.505 --> 38:23.551
Look, it wouldn't be good for you
if this becomes trouble.

38:29.557 --> 38:30.391
Please leave.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.811
So she is here.

38:34.395 --> 38:35.563
Sakura!

38:35.646 --> 38:37.898
- Stop it!
- I can't.

38:37.982 --> 38:40.318
Sakura. Get out of my way!

38:41.861 --> 38:42.695
Sakura!

38:49.910 --> 38:51.245
I'll be back.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.130
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

39:02.548 --> 39:05.426
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

39:35.748 --> 39:36.582
Hey…

39:38.125 --> 39:39.085
I'm sorry.

39:40.127 --> 39:41.295
Thank you.

39:42.880 --> 39:45.174
I'm just a little banged up. It's fine.

39:47.927 --> 39:51.597
I think I should…

39:52.223 --> 39:56.811
Goldfish can only grow as big
as their container will allow them.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.690
I can't let you go back

40:02.525 --> 40:05.486
to someone who will
shut you in and bind you.

40:18.999 --> 40:20.501
Don't you think, little guy?

40:40.855 --> 40:42.565
He's not "little guy."

40:47.278 --> 40:49.822
I gave him a name.

40:52.366 --> 40:53.284
Haru.

40:57.955 --> 41:04.253
I thought that Haru
would suit Sakura well.

41:09.550 --> 41:12.678
- You don't like it?
- No, that's not it at all.

41:14.638 --> 41:16.390
Because my name is Haruto.

41:23.022 --> 41:24.648
Sakura and Haru.

41:25.983 --> 41:27.735
They are certainly linked together.

41:44.919 --> 41:47.922
When you notice the symptoms of a disease,
it's already…

41:50.216 --> 41:51.091
too late.
