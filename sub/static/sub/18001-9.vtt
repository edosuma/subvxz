00:07.302 --> 00:09.407
Hey, what if you guys
were given a choice,

00:09.441 --> 00:11.743
if you had to make
one or the other...

00:11.777 --> 00:15.616
couldn't read comics for five years

00:15.651 --> 00:20.559
or you couldn't have sex for five years?

00:20.594 --> 00:22.632
I'm disgusted by the
posing of the question,

00:22.667 --> 00:25.470
disgusted that these two took
more than one second to answer.

00:25.504 --> 00:27.440
[Laughter]

00:27.475 --> 00:30.648
I'm all-around disgusted.

00:30.683 --> 00:33.787
Give me a minute to
weigh the pros and cons.

00:33.822 --> 00:36.963
What are the pros of not
having sex for five years?

00:36.997 --> 00:39.165
- Tell me one.
- Well, I just...

00:39.199 --> 00:40.834
No, five years without comics.

00:40.869 --> 00:43.472
It's a long time.

00:43.507 --> 00:45.042
Just saying.

00:45.076 --> 00:47.713
What you guys are failing
to put into the equation

00:47.747 --> 00:49.517
is, you know, your poor wives.

00:49.551 --> 00:53.956
I mean, am I willing to deprive
my wife of me for five years?

00:53.990 --> 00:55.358
I think not.

00:55.392 --> 00:56.360
I'd say look in your crystal ball.

00:56.394 --> 00:57.862
Is there some really cool stuff

00:57.897 --> 00:59.564
that's gonna happen in the next five years?

00:59.598 --> 01:02.635
Why are you looking into a
crystal ball at his sex life?

01:02.670 --> 01:05.306
Or comics which one is he talking about?

01:05.340 --> 01:07.007
Is some really cool stuff happening, Walt?

01:07.041 --> 01:08.911
Am I getting lucky?

01:08.945 --> 01:11.081

01:44.163 --> 01:46.698
Hello and welcome to another
episode of Comic Book Men,

01:46.732 --> 01:47.999
the only show that believes

01:48.033 --> 01:50.369
Batman should stop v-ing superman

01:50.404 --> 01:52.139
and just become super friends again.

01:52.173 --> 01:53.343
I'm your host, Kevin Smith.

01:53.378 --> 01:55.045
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

01:55.079 --> 01:56.579
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

01:56.613 --> 01:59.049
Walter J. Flanagan, tell me a story.

01:59.083 --> 02:02.219
Do you remember an era when,
if a network show was a hit,

02:02.253 --> 02:04.219
inevitably, it would become a cartoon?

02:04.254 --> 02:06.923
Of course. How could I forget?

02:10.693 --> 02:11.927
Hey, how you doing?

02:11.961 --> 02:12.854
Hey, guys. How you doing today?

02:12.854 --> 02:14.439
I got a piece here you
might be interested in.

02:14.439 --> 02:15.263
All right.

02:15.263 --> 02:17.933
I've got a cell from Fonz
and the happy days gang

02:17.968 --> 02:20.202
from 1981, Hanna-Barbera, ABC TV.

02:20.238 --> 02:22.574
Oh, my God.

02:29.951 --> 02:31.652
Now, this is a cell?

02:31.686 --> 02:33.087
It's actually two cells, yeah.

02:33.121 --> 02:34.589
The one cell has the Fonz on it.

02:34.623 --> 02:36.557
Then the second cell has Mr. cool on it

02:36.592 --> 02:38.725
'cause usually when they do
the cells, they do it in layers,

02:38.760 --> 02:39.994
you know, to give it, like, almost, like,

02:40.029 --> 02:41.432
that three-dimensional look to it.

02:41.466 --> 02:43.100
These hard to find?

02:43.135 --> 02:45.102
Yeah, I've been collecting
Hanna-Barbera cells

02:45.136 --> 02:46.338
for ten years now,

02:46.372 --> 02:48.108
and this was one of the first times

02:48.142 --> 02:50.008
<i>I ever found a happy days cell.</i>

02:50.042 --> 02:51.842
Do you remember this has to be right

02:51.876 --> 02:53.511
around when you were born, right?

02:53.546 --> 02:55.580
Yeah, I was probably
about six or seven years old.

02:55.614 --> 02:56.948
Never really got into it, though,

02:56.982 --> 02:59.016
- for whatever reason.
- Why?

02:59.050 --> 03:01.655
Didn't really get why
they had to animate it.

03:01.690 --> 03:03.357
I thought, wasn't live action enough?

03:03.392 --> 03:05.958
What was the backstory? That
I didn't even get either.

03:05.992 --> 03:07.359
All you got to do is
watch the opening, man.

03:07.394 --> 03:09.261
The opening was one of those great openings

03:09.296 --> 03:11.531
that brought us into Milwaukee,

03:11.565 --> 03:14.669
and a ufo comes down
in front of Arnold's...

03:14.703 --> 03:17.041
- It's not Mork. [Laughs]
- (Walt Laughs)

03:17.075 --> 03:18.813
Not this time.

03:18.847 --> 03:22.383
It's this cool chick from
outer space who has a U.F.O

03:22.417 --> 03:24.385
that's also a time machine, as I recall.

03:24.419 --> 03:26.557
I wonder, do you think this
was from an unaired episode

03:26.591 --> 03:28.193
where, like, he was starving in the woods,

03:28.227 --> 03:30.359
he was about to kill Mr.
Cool with a screwdriver?

03:30.394 --> 03:31.561
[Laughter]

03:31.596 --> 03:33.666
I adored this cartoon as a kid.

03:33.700 --> 03:35.635
- Really?
- It may not have been as edgy

03:35.669 --> 03:39.238
<i>or as funny as the
live-action happy days...</i>

03:39.273 --> 03:42.874
- Wait, happy days was edgy?
- [Laughter]

03:42.908 --> 03:45.311
<i>In an era where you just got
to see happy days once a week...</i>

03:45.345 --> 03:46.579
Right.

03:46.613 --> 03:48.046
I was just thankful that, you know,

03:48.081 --> 03:49.714
I could see it again on Saturday mornings.

03:49.749 --> 03:52.720
- And I just really dug it a lot.
- You're like, "finally!

03:52.755 --> 03:55.353
<i>"They took all the worst
parts out of happy days.</i>

03:55.388 --> 03:57.320
"Mr. and Mrs. C,

03:57.355 --> 03:59.188
"Chuck, Potsie.

03:59.223 --> 04:00.758
And then he took it to space."

04:00.792 --> 04:03.357
[Laughter]

04:03.392 --> 04:04.892
So how about you? Are
you a big happy days fan?

04:04.926 --> 04:06.860
<i>I am a big happy days fan.</i>

04:06.895 --> 04:08.527
I'm also a big Hanna-Barbera fan.

04:08.562 --> 04:11.731
That's how this kind of
melds into both worlds.

04:11.766 --> 04:13.500
I am a gigantic Hanna-Barbera fan.

04:13.534 --> 04:14.902
They were the kings of Saturday morning.

04:14.937 --> 04:17.571
- Yeah, right.
- King of the talking dog.

04:17.605 --> 04:20.209
<i>- That too.
- What about happy days to you?</i>

04:20.221 --> 04:22.991
Did you want, like, a
nice little leather jacket,

04:23.025 --> 04:26.328
your white undershirt,
and your dungarees on?

04:26.362 --> 04:27.729
Yeah, oh, absolutely.

04:27.764 --> 04:28.730
I absolutely wanted to be Fonzie.

04:28.765 --> 04:30.497
Can you imagine?

04:30.531 --> 04:32.233
Can you imagine that outfit
right now, him wearing that?

04:32.267 --> 04:34.169
What, right now? I couldn't
pull it off right now?

04:34.203 --> 04:38.402
- I...
- Or ever.

04:38.436 --> 04:41.038
All right, so are you
here today to try to sell it?

04:41.072 --> 04:42.172
Yeah, I'm thinking about selling it.

04:42.206 --> 04:43.740
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

04:43.775 --> 04:45.343
This is the kind of piece
that I would love to see

04:45.378 --> 04:47.079
hanging on my wall at home.

04:47.113 --> 04:50.113
Think anybody would be upset
if I pursued it for my own?

04:50.148 --> 04:52.586
I don't think you would get any pushback.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.388
I wasn't asking if you would be upset.

04:54.422 --> 04:56.189
[Laughter]

04:56.223 --> 04:57.291
Yeah.

04:57.325 --> 04:58.760
I'm definitely interested.

04:58.795 --> 05:00.196
What are you looking to get for it?

05:00.230 --> 05:01.530
I'm looking at 250 for this item.

05:01.564 --> 05:02.797
- 250, huh?
- Yeah.

05:02.832 --> 05:04.868
It's a rare item,
got two of the...

05:04.902 --> 05:07.740
the two main characters, really,
of the show and great poses.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.707
Would you take 75 for it?

05:09.741 --> 05:11.709
75 is a bit low.

05:11.744 --> 05:13.612
<i>It's not like this is,
like, steamboat Willie,</i>

05:13.646 --> 05:14.712
it's Fonzie and a dog.

05:14.747 --> 05:18.384
You have garbage.

05:18.418 --> 05:20.253
200 would probably be my final,

05:20.287 --> 05:21.621
as low as I'd go on it.

05:21.655 --> 05:25.256
No chance you'd take 150 for it?

05:25.291 --> 05:26.924
I'd like to stand firm on 200.

05:26.959 --> 05:29.295
That's probably at my
high mark as well, 150.

05:29.329 --> 05:30.964
What ugliness.

05:30.998 --> 05:33.634
- Hey, man, it happens.
- I'll give you 200 for it.

05:33.668 --> 05:34.902
- You'll give me 200 for it?
- You want that?

05:34.936 --> 05:36.436
What are you gonna do with that?

05:36.470 --> 05:38.170
What do you mean what
am I gonna do with it?

05:38.205 --> 05:41.105
I'm gonna hang it in...
gonna hang it in your house.

05:41.140 --> 05:42.774
- Oh, okay.
- You got it for me?

05:42.808 --> 05:46.212
Yeah. Now I'm all... now I'm all...

05:46.248 --> 05:47.682
- Choked up?
- Indebted?

05:47.717 --> 05:49.353
[Laughter]

05:49.387 --> 05:51.155
That is so sweet, man. That's awesome.

05:51.190 --> 05:52.792
You knew he was sitting there going,

05:52.826 --> 05:54.361
"I want it, but I can't
make that commitment."

05:54.396 --> 05:56.365
Probably the most beautiful
thing that happened

05:56.399 --> 05:58.733
<i>to anything remotely happy days -related</i>

05:58.767 --> 06:00.666
since Fonz jumped over a shark.

06:00.700 --> 06:03.568
- Aw.
- [Laughs]

06:03.603 --> 06:04.902
I think you're underselling him.

06:04.937 --> 06:07.473
[Laughter]

06:07.507 --> 06:09.443
- Anybody work here?
- Oh!

06:09.478 --> 06:10.947
- Hello, there.
- Adam West.

06:10.981 --> 06:12.216
Ooh, lookee.

06:12.251 --> 06:14.685
It's almost Life-Size.

06:21.944 --> 06:24.047
What, are you training
for the octagon, dude?

06:24.081 --> 06:26.549
Anybody work here?

06:26.584 --> 06:28.986
- Hello, there.
- Oh!

06:29.020 --> 06:31.556
Kevin asked me to come in and say hello,

06:31.590 --> 06:35.264
and maybe I might even find
my own comic book in here.

06:35.298 --> 06:36.565
Come on over here.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.902
Holy mackerel.

06:37.936 --> 06:39.569
Ooh, lookee.

06:39.604 --> 06:42.936
It's almost life-size. [Laughter]

06:42.971 --> 06:44.404
- If you're Ming, yeah.
- That's good.

06:44.439 --> 06:46.406
Okay, guys, you take credit cards?

06:46.440 --> 06:48.573
Ah, we do take credit cards.

06:48.608 --> 06:50.841
Mr. west, it is an honor

06:50.876 --> 06:53.577
to have you be in our presence
at the stash, it's amazing.

06:53.611 --> 06:55.712
Thank you. You're very gracious.

06:55.746 --> 06:58.348
They've even been staring
at the doll, passing it around,

06:58.382 --> 07:00.019
- saying, "you're awesome."
- We have.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.687
"You're awesome."

07:01.721 --> 07:04.091
They've been practicing.
They've been practicing.

07:04.125 --> 07:05.863
For about a week now since Kevin told us

07:05.897 --> 07:08.098
you were arriving at the
stash to come sign some comics,

07:08.132 --> 07:11.970
I've been practicing how to
tell you how much your portrayal

07:12.005 --> 07:15.238
of Batman has meant to
me since I was a child.

07:15.273 --> 07:18.410
You know, I... it's
hard to know what to say,

07:18.444 --> 07:21.280
except you have my gratitude.

07:21.314 --> 07:25.285
We were able to create a
show that's been long-lasting

07:25.320 --> 07:28.986
and has influenced so
many lives in good ways.

07:29.021 --> 07:30.889
That's good.

07:30.924 --> 07:33.157
The doorway to Batman for a lot of us,

07:33.192 --> 07:35.791
particularly of our age, was Adam West.

07:35.825 --> 07:38.428
Even before the comic
books, I saw the TV show.

07:38.462 --> 07:40.129
That was Batman.

07:40.163 --> 07:42.195
He was the first drawbridge
to that character for me.

07:42.230 --> 07:46.732
I'm like you. I lived
and breathed Batman.

07:46.766 --> 07:49.028
- And that Batman was Adam West.
- I love him to death.

07:49.062 --> 07:50.864
He's the greatest guy in the world, man.

07:50.898 --> 07:52.632
He was coming back east for something else,

07:52.666 --> 07:55.365
and I was just like, "please
stop in at my comic bookstore

07:55.399 --> 07:57.435
at the secret stash,"
'cause I'd just written

07:57.469 --> 07:59.905
<i>some Batman '66 meets the Green Hornet</i>

07:59.940 --> 08:01.307
comic books with Ralph Garman.

08:01.341 --> 08:03.042
So boom, to have them ready

08:03.076 --> 08:05.243
and have Adam West
tagging those books...

08:05.278 --> 08:06.977
We're about to earn off west's back.

08:07.012 --> 08:08.611
[Laughter]

08:08.645 --> 08:11.248
Come over here and sit
down. These are the books.

08:11.283 --> 08:12.984
Bryan, move out of the way.
Let Mr. West have a seat.

08:13.018 --> 08:14.717
Look at this.

08:14.752 --> 08:17.321
It's a Batman-Green Hornet
crossover comic book.

08:17.355 --> 08:19.723
We were hoping that you could sign them,

08:19.757 --> 08:21.893
and we would be able to
pick your brain a little bit.

08:21.927 --> 08:25.464
Well, what's ever left up here, sure.

08:25.498 --> 08:27.332
Okay, give me a question.

08:27.366 --> 08:30.302
<i>My favorite episode of
the Batman television series</i>

08:30.336 --> 08:33.472
is when mad hatter turned the bat-cow pink

08:33.506 --> 08:35.207
with radioactivity.

08:35.241 --> 08:37.212
Holy isotopes, right, Batman?

08:37.246 --> 08:41.586
- It still tingles.
- [Laughter]

08:41.620 --> 08:44.488
Mr. West, my favorite
episode's the two-Parter

08:44.522 --> 08:46.188
with you and Robin

08:46.222 --> 08:48.157
meet the Green Hornet, Kato.

08:48.191 --> 08:49.193
It was awesome.

08:49.228 --> 08:50.663
Don't tell Burt Ward this,

08:50.698 --> 08:52.699
but I was kind of hoping you'd take Kato on

08:52.733 --> 08:55.239
as your ward rather than dick Grayson.

08:55.274 --> 08:58.576
I think that Bruce Lee could
not have played that role.

08:58.610 --> 09:01.449
<i>He was perfectly cast in Green Hornet...</i>

09:01.484 --> 09:03.556
- That's true.
- Because it was a show

09:03.590 --> 09:06.591
that attempted to be somewhat realistic,

09:06.625 --> 09:09.957
where we were only realistic for the kids.

09:09.992 --> 09:11.593
Now, with all due
respect, Mr. West, I mean,

09:11.627 --> 09:13.895
you're obviously the better superhero.

09:13.929 --> 09:15.465
But I always thought that the Black Beauty

09:15.499 --> 09:18.968
was clearly the superior automobile.

09:19.002 --> 09:20.269
Well, you know,

09:20.304 --> 09:22.541
I hate to argue with guys like you,

09:22.575 --> 09:24.812
because obviously you're huge fans.

09:24.846 --> 09:30.415
But I think that our Batmobile
is the world's fastest car.

09:30.450 --> 09:31.817
Mm. Yeah.

09:31.851 --> 09:33.385
Excuse his ignorance, Mr. West.

09:33.420 --> 09:34.654
I'll have him fired later.

09:34.688 --> 09:36.857
Thank you very much. [Whooshes]

09:36.891 --> 09:38.493
- Ooh.
- Blasphemy.

09:38.527 --> 09:41.396
And he says this in front of Adam West.

09:41.430 --> 09:42.763
To Mr. West's face?

09:42.798 --> 09:44.596
I wanted to see what he would say.

09:44.630 --> 09:46.566
But, I mean, I thought maybe
he would agree with me even.

09:46.600 --> 09:48.234
Isn't that something you say after a man

09:48.269 --> 09:50.005
has left the building?

09:50.040 --> 09:52.010
Even if you're an idiot,
you say it after he left.

09:52.044 --> 09:56.415
It's beyond idiocy to
say it when he's there.

09:56.450 --> 09:58.951
In any kind of a drag race,

09:58.985 --> 10:03.356
the Batmobile could take
those other wheels easily.

10:03.390 --> 10:05.125
- Yeah, I agree.
- Without a doubt.

10:05.160 --> 10:07.127
I don't know, that's
something I'd like to see.

10:07.161 --> 10:08.661
Kato was kind of a genius

10:08.696 --> 10:10.496
when it came to automotive engineering.

10:10.531 --> 10:12.431
I take the city bus here every day.

10:12.466 --> 10:15.198
That could beat Black Beauty.

10:15.232 --> 10:16.631
Don't you got a friend

10:16.666 --> 10:19.434
who owns replicas of both the Batmobile

10:19.469 --> 10:21.634
- and Black Beauty?
- Yeah, I do.

10:21.669 --> 10:22.933
So I mean, theoretically,

10:22.967 --> 10:24.635
we could put that to the test, I guess.

10:24.669 --> 10:25.770
Why don't you call him up?
Why don't you put your money

10:25.804 --> 10:27.304
- where your mouth is?
- Yeah.

10:27.339 --> 10:28.305
Why don't we get those cars down here,

10:28.339 --> 10:29.706
do a little drag racing?

10:29.741 --> 10:31.174
You up for a little drag
racing today, Mr. West?

10:31.209 --> 10:33.044
- Oh, of course. Absolutely.
- All right.

10:33.078 --> 10:34.379
- Okay.
- I'm up for any challenge.

10:34.413 --> 10:35.646
I'll be your Green Hornet. Come on.

10:35.681 --> 10:36.814
All right, you got it.

10:36.848 --> 10:38.250
If you're serious, let's do it.

10:38.284 --> 10:39.687
- Well, call him!
- Call him!

10:39.721 --> 10:40.989
Let's roll, Kato!

10:41.023 --> 10:42.523
Let's do it! Let's do it!

10:42.558 --> 10:44.090
I'm wondering if you'd be interested

10:44.125 --> 10:46.462
<i>in purchasing the incredible Hulk 271.</i>

10:46.496 --> 10:48.964
First rocket raccoon in comic book form.

10:48.998 --> 10:50.398
All right, let's do this, man.

10:50.433 --> 10:52.134
It's time to put up or shut up.

10:52.169 --> 10:53.136
All right, let's go.

10:53.170 --> 10:54.670
Going down, boys.

10:56.358 --> 10:58.089
So back then, the show's huge.

10:58.124 --> 11:00.791
You're Batman, which is amazing.

11:00.825 --> 11:03.193
What was it like with the women?

11:03.227 --> 11:07.830
And did any of them ever ask
you to dress up and be like...

11:07.864 --> 11:09.464
- [Imitating heroic music] 
- Bum bum dah!

11:09.498 --> 11:10.797
And hip-hip-tugen!

11:10.832 --> 11:13.136
- [Laughter]
- Uh...

11:13.170 --> 11:15.102
- Maybe you guys can explain it.
- Well, '60s...

11:15.136 --> 11:18.072
tell 'em what it's like with women.

11:18.106 --> 11:19.674
They don't know.

11:19.709 --> 11:21.677
That's why we're in a comic bookstore.

11:21.711 --> 11:23.942
And again, I'm not saying now.
I know you're married and stuff.

11:23.976 --> 11:26.613
I'm just thinking back then, '60s, '70s...

11:26.647 --> 11:27.815
Jason, I understand what you're saying.

11:27.850 --> 11:29.116
- I really do.
- The women, yes.

11:29.150 --> 11:31.316
- The costume and the character.
- Yes.

11:31.350 --> 11:35.352
You know, all that baggage
made it wonderful with women...

11:35.386 --> 11:36.922
- Yes.
- Because without my cape,

11:36.956 --> 11:38.589
I was nothing with women.

11:38.623 --> 11:40.591
[Laughter]

11:40.625 --> 11:43.158
So you're suggesting we get capes.

11:43.192 --> 11:44.359
[Laughter]

11:54.098 --> 11:57.401
You know, I'm so sick
of everybody discounting

11:57.401 --> 11:59.202
the classic monsters.

11:59.238 --> 12:00.940
I think that they could hold their own

12:00.974 --> 12:02.876
if they did some sort
of big crossover movie,

12:02.910 --> 12:06.580
the classic universal monsters
versus the new age monsters.

12:06.615 --> 12:09.217
You're telling me Freddy or Jason

12:09.250 --> 12:11.051
couldn't take down Dracula?

12:11.085 --> 12:15.189
Dracula against any New-Age
Monster is going to win.

12:15.223 --> 12:17.791
I don't care what monster
you throw up there... pinhead.

12:17.826 --> 12:19.359
Pinhead's not winning?

12:19.393 --> 12:21.093
I mean, if pinhead
has a stake with him...

12:21.127 --> 12:23.563
- Yeah, it's over.
- It's over for Dracula, right?

12:23.597 --> 12:24.931
And he could only fight at night,

12:24.965 --> 12:26.533
and he's got a weird accent.

12:26.568 --> 12:28.603
So what? What is that supposed to mean?

12:28.637 --> 12:30.439
You might not take him seriously.

12:30.474 --> 12:33.878
"Come here. I'm serious!
I'm going to kick your ass!

12:33.913 --> 12:37.317
Come back, pinhead, come back!"

12:43.092 --> 12:44.796
Hey, man. How you doing?

12:44.830 --> 12:46.436
I'm wondering if you
gentlemen might be interested

12:46.470 --> 12:48.403
<i>in purchasing the incredible Hulk 271.</i>

12:48.438 --> 12:49.906
271.

12:49.940 --> 12:52.245
First rocket raccoon in comic book form.

12:59.250 --> 13:00.617
It's a pretty big issue.

13:00.652 --> 13:01.652
It's gaining a lot of heat, right?

13:01.687 --> 13:03.419
Yeah, my specialty is kind of,

13:03.454 --> 13:06.155
I collect oddball characters
like Woodgod, squirrel girl.

13:06.190 --> 13:08.293
I kind of thought squirrel girl
would be the one to take off,

13:08.328 --> 13:09.697
but it's rocket raccoon.

13:09.731 --> 13:11.100
You heard of rocket raccoon?

13:11.134 --> 13:12.835
- He's really an alien.
- Oh, all right.

13:12.869 --> 13:16.037
And he travels with these
little rockets on his paws.

13:16.071 --> 13:17.638
That's why he's called rocket raccoon.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.373
I mean, I'm telling you, it sounds cornier

13:19.407 --> 13:21.175
than it really is, but he's really badass.

13:21.209 --> 13:23.542
- It sounds badass.
- [Laughter]

13:23.576 --> 13:26.443
And looks badass, as well.

13:26.477 --> 13:28.679
One of the biggest
blockbusters of the past summer,

13:28.713 --> 13:30.179
- Guardians Of The Galaxy.
- Ah!

13:30.214 --> 13:32.715
Every child on the planet, you know,

13:32.749 --> 13:35.320
is now in love with
Groot and Rocket Raccoon.

13:35.354 --> 13:36.955
I've been a comics fan for years,

13:36.989 --> 13:38.688
and I don't remember
these characters lighting

13:38.722 --> 13:40.824
- the world on fire at all.
- They didn't.

13:40.859 --> 13:44.326
Rocket raccoon languished
in the 50Â¢ bins for decades.

13:44.360 --> 13:45.726
That's right.

13:45.761 --> 13:47.394
When they introduced
the character, you know,

13:47.429 --> 13:50.031
no comic book fan wants to
see funny, talking animals.

13:50.065 --> 13:51.731
- That is a thing of the past.
- Exactly.

13:51.766 --> 13:53.732
But now, because the movie took off,

13:53.767 --> 13:57.168
rocket raccoon is ensconced
in the mount rushmore

13:57.202 --> 13:58.902
of movie animals,

13:58.936 --> 14:01.336
you know, right up there with,
like, rin tin tin, Benji...

14:01.370 --> 14:04.004
- Whoa.
- Yes.

14:04.038 --> 14:05.039
Oh, yes.

14:05.074 --> 14:06.343
Grandpa just woke up.

14:06.377 --> 14:08.411
[Laughter]

14:08.446 --> 14:11.852
<i>Incredible Hulk 181, incredible Hulk 271.</i>

14:11.886 --> 14:13.654
181, first appearance of Wolverine.

14:13.688 --> 14:14.922
Right.

14:14.956 --> 14:17.058
271, the first comic book appearance

14:17.093 --> 14:18.429
of rocket raccoon.

14:18.463 --> 14:22.199
Is rocket raccoon poised to maybe one day

14:22.234 --> 14:25.037
<i>fetch over a grand, I mean, just
like Hulk 181 now is fetching?</i>

14:25.072 --> 14:27.372
<i>Well, Hulk 181 was always up there.</i>

14:27.407 --> 14:29.206
But this is something out of left field.

14:29.239 --> 14:31.406
No one knew what rocket
raccoon was gonna do.

14:31.440 --> 14:33.244
It's kind of sad for the Hulk

14:33.278 --> 14:35.679
that the Hulk's most valuable
issues have nothing to do

14:35.714 --> 14:38.748
with the fact that they're
valuable 'cause Hulk's in them.

14:38.782 --> 14:41.718
It's like now he had to play
second fiddle to Wolverine

14:41.753 --> 14:43.920
<i>for the second biggest
issue in the Hulk run.</i>

14:43.955 --> 14:45.387
Now he's got to sit there and go, "okay,

14:45.421 --> 14:46.621
"now my third most valuable issue may be

14:46.655 --> 14:48.123
"because rocket raccoon was in it?"

14:48.157 --> 14:49.761
Yeah, except the Hulk's not real,

14:49.795 --> 14:51.766
so he doesn't care.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.735
[Laughter]

14:53.769 --> 14:57.108
Um, if the Guardians Of The Galaxy
turns into the franchise

14:57.142 --> 14:58.979
I think everybody thinks
it's gonna turn into,

14:59.013 --> 15:00.748
<i>this could be a Hulk 181.</i>

15:00.783 --> 15:02.151
I definitely am interested in it.

15:02.185 --> 15:03.919
What are you looking to get for it?

15:03.954 --> 15:05.822
The condition it's in,
I'm looking for about 150.

15:05.857 --> 15:07.758
All right.

15:07.792 --> 15:11.157
Would you take 80 for it?

15:12.360 --> 15:14.027
80 is a little too low.

15:14.062 --> 15:15.663
- Okay.
- Um...

15:15.697 --> 15:16.930
I mean, you know, it's kind of...

15:16.964 --> 15:18.265
it's got some rough edges,

15:18.300 --> 15:19.768
you know, soft edges, I should say.

15:19.802 --> 15:21.940
It's a little dog-eared,
some spine issues.

15:21.974 --> 15:23.645
I can see some creasing.

15:23.680 --> 15:25.647
Let's say 125?

15:29.651 --> 15:32.986
Would you take 100 for it?

15:33.020 --> 15:34.219
Yeah, I could let it go for 100.

15:34.251 --> 15:35.452
All right, you got yourself a deal.

15:35.487 --> 15:38.388
- Okay.
- $100.

15:38.422 --> 15:40.022
Here you go, my friend.

15:40.056 --> 15:41.623
- Okay, thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

15:41.657 --> 15:43.392
- Do you remember reading this?
- Yeah.

15:43.426 --> 15:45.294
It was not good.

15:45.329 --> 15:46.729
Well, I mean, it was a different era.

15:46.763 --> 15:48.163
And it doesn't matter.

15:48.197 --> 15:49.497
<i>I mean, Hulk 181 isn't that good.</i>

15:49.531 --> 15:50.898
[Laughter]

15:53.032 --> 15:54.163
Atomic batteries to power.

15:54.197 --> 15:56.298
Turbines to speed.

15:56.332 --> 15:58.265
Go!

16:05.457 --> 16:06.686
All right, man, it's go time.

16:06.686 --> 16:07.793
You ready for me and Mr. West

16:07.827 --> 16:10.863
to drop some bat guano on your faces?

16:10.897 --> 16:12.264
That sounds disgusting.

16:12.299 --> 16:13.766
You got to be kidding me.

16:13.800 --> 16:14.767
Everybody knows that Black Beauty

16:14.801 --> 16:16.468
is the ultimate super car.

16:16.502 --> 16:17.635
It's better than the Batmobile.

16:17.670 --> 16:19.036
This thing looks like a toy car

16:19.070 --> 16:20.702
with a bunch of bat stuff pasted on there.

16:20.737 --> 16:23.072
That thing looks like a
hearse with a sticker on it.

16:23.106 --> 16:24.440
Ming made the call.

16:24.475 --> 16:26.508
We were able to secure both vehicles

16:26.542 --> 16:28.342
down on main street.

16:28.409 --> 16:31.442
Let's truly see which
vehicle would've won in a race.

16:31.476 --> 16:34.544
Adam West is like, "I just
came to sign a comic book.

16:34.579 --> 16:36.079
What is this all about?"

16:36.114 --> 16:38.149
This replica Batmobile
is all pimped out.

16:38.183 --> 16:39.887
It's got all the bells and whistles.

16:39.921 --> 16:42.290
It's got the Batphone.
It's got the bat-ram.

16:42.750 --> 16:46.818
It's got the atomic,
nuclear-powered teleconverter.

16:46.853 --> 16:48.456
Booyah.

16:48.490 --> 16:50.027
It's all about what's under the hood.

16:50.062 --> 16:52.863
The Black Beauty is
Detroit steel at its best.

16:52.896 --> 16:54.964
It's got a scanner, and
there's a rotary phone...

16:54.998 --> 16:59.369
poor deluded child.

16:59.403 --> 17:01.372
There's no chance, guys. No chance.

17:01.406 --> 17:02.907
All right, let's do this, man.

17:02.941 --> 17:04.640
It's time to put up or shut up.

17:04.675 --> 17:05.809
All right, let's go.

17:05.844 --> 17:07.378
Going down, boys.

17:07.414 --> 17:10.319
Mr. West, I know that you
always drive the Batmobile,

17:10.354 --> 17:12.387
but it would be an honor and a privilege

17:12.421 --> 17:15.989
if you allowed me to
drive the Batmobile today.

17:16.022 --> 17:17.757
You drive the Batmobile?

17:17.791 --> 17:19.325
It's always been a dream of mine.

17:19.358 --> 17:21.194
Do you have a driver's license?

17:21.229 --> 17:22.596
I do.

17:22.630 --> 17:24.664
- Yeah, go ahead and drive.
- Thank you.

17:24.699 --> 17:27.834
Make me proud, Walter!

17:27.867 --> 17:32.043
Sitting shotgun is Adam West,
and I'm driving the Batmobile.

17:32.077 --> 17:34.943
We grew up watching this
guy on TV when we were kids.

17:34.977 --> 17:37.882
You probably never in
a million years thought

17:37.916 --> 17:40.950
you'd, "a," meet him,
"b," be in a car with him.

17:40.984 --> 17:44.020
Not just be in a car with
him, be in a Batmobile with him.

17:44.055 --> 17:46.691
The vehicle of all vehicles.

17:46.725 --> 17:50.563
I mean, it's better
than winning the lottery.

17:50.597 --> 17:53.867
- Well, not really.
- No.

17:53.902 --> 17:54.934
But it's a close second.

17:54.968 --> 17:56.067
It's way up there.

17:56.102 --> 17:58.402
Walter, start your engine.

18:03.478 --> 18:04.879
Oh, you're beautiful.

18:04.913 --> 18:08.450
Ming, start your engine!

18:14.623 --> 18:16.057
Atomic batteries to power.

18:16.092 --> 18:17.425
Turbines to speed.

18:17.460 --> 18:20.594
Roger. Ready to move out.

18:24.129 --> 18:27.098
[Whimsical music]

18:27.132 --> 18:29.933
âª âª

18:29.967 --> 18:33.270
[Dramatic music]

18:33.304 --> 18:36.637
Remember what we talked about, Ming.

18:36.672 --> 18:39.340
Go!

18:39.374 --> 18:41.973
- Go! Go!
- What are you doing?

18:42.008 --> 18:43.941
Come on, go. Go, come on!

18:43.976 --> 18:47.080
Walter, get some speed up.

18:47.114 --> 18:49.082
Holy backseat driving, Batman.

18:49.116 --> 18:51.816
Come on, move it!

18:51.851 --> 18:53.687
Move it!

18:53.721 --> 18:55.925
There was a mountain of
paperwork we had to fill out

18:55.959 --> 18:57.627
for the insurance to race these cars.

18:57.661 --> 18:59.863
If we would've put even the tiniest scratch

18:59.898 --> 19:02.466
on one of these cars, the
stash would have a new owner,

19:02.500 --> 19:05.104
so we couldn't go over 10 miles an hour.

19:05.139 --> 19:07.642
And Walt threatened me
not to drive any faster,

19:07.676 --> 19:10.546
so, you know, I was basically
handcuffed at that point.

19:10.580 --> 19:12.385
[Laughter]

19:12.419 --> 19:15.122
Two iconic, powerful,
crime-fighting vehicles

19:15.156 --> 19:16.890
going head-to-head
for the first time

19:16.924 --> 19:18.958
in the world's slowest race.

19:18.992 --> 19:22.527
[Laughter]

19:23.528 --> 19:24.661
Faster!

19:24.695 --> 19:26.195
- I'm trying.
- Come on!

19:26.229 --> 19:27.996
We're gonna find out if this Batmobile

19:28.030 --> 19:30.564
has the bat ejector seats if
you don't be quiet over there.

19:30.598 --> 19:32.232
We can take these guys. Come on!

19:32.267 --> 19:34.632
Get moving! Get going. Look at him!

19:34.667 --> 19:36.636
He's faster than we are.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.371
We are blistering now.

19:38.406 --> 19:40.220
- Yes! Yes! Yes!
- Move it, man. Come on!

19:43.331 --> 19:46.132
Way to go, waiter!
Way to go.

19:46.167 --> 19:47.416
- Bat bump!
- You threw the race!

19:47.468 --> 19:48.834
Yeah!

19:48.887 --> 19:50.970
- The batmobile won. Barely.
- Of course.

19:51.005 --> 19:52.774
Of course the batmobile wins,
every time.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.614
It was close.
You guys barely won.

19:54.614 --> 19:55.635
I lost by a hair.

19:55.635 --> 19:58.144
You lost because
it's your destiny to lose.

19:58.179 --> 20:00.596
[laughter]

20:00.648 --> 20:01.496
What'd I tell you, boys?

20:01.496 --> 20:04.079
The batmobile
just blew you away, didn't it?

20:04.132 --> 20:05.464
I got no excuse.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.166
A win is a win.
Congratulations, Mr. West.

20:07.641 --> 20:09.112
Yeah, thank you, Mr. West.

20:09.299 --> 20:11.318
- Yes, thanks for coming, man.
- Thank you so much.

20:11.318 --> 20:12.410
- It was very awesome.
- You bet.

20:12.410 --> 20:13.795
Let me give you a ride
back to your car.

20:13.795 --> 20:15.142
I can walk faster, waiter.

20:15.372 --> 20:16.721
[laughter]

20:17.581 --> 20:19.414
That's a day
that I will cherish

20:19.449 --> 20:21.783
For the remaining years
of my life.

20:21.835 --> 20:23.284
Only thing missing would've been,

20:23.336 --> 20:26.171
if one of the shelves
in the stash opened up

20:26.206 --> 20:28.757
And you guys slid
down the Batpole together.

20:28.792 --> 20:31.676
It was everything and more
than I ever would've thought

20:31.711 --> 20:33.762
It would've been, you know,
having him in the car with me.

20:33.797 --> 20:35.797
And I'm not gonna lie, man.
It felt good to win.

20:35.849 --> 20:37.465
It felt good!

20:37.517 --> 20:39.100
When batman's your copilot,

20:39.136 --> 20:41.102
Every day's a win.

20:41.138 --> 20:43.021
Oh, we're gonna shut down
the atomic pile,

20:43.056 --> 20:44.973
Close up the batcave
for the night, kids.

20:45.025 --> 20:46.558
For Comic Book Men,
I'm Kevin Smith.

20:46.610 --> 20:48.026
- Bryan Johnson.
- Walt Flanagan.

20:48.061 --> 20:49.444
- Mike Zapcic.
- Ming Chen.

20:49.479 --> 20:52.647
Tune in next week, kids,
same bat-time,

20:52.699 --> 20:55.150
Same bat-channel. Good night.

20:55.439 --> 20:57.831
