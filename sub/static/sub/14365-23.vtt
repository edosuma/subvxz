00:01.006 --> 00:03.976
<i>Previously on Transformers Prime...</i>

00:04.045 --> 00:07.513
Four sets of coordinates from
Alpha Trion remain encrypted.

00:07.582 --> 00:11.283
<i>It is logical to conclude that
each corresponds to the location</i>

00:11.352 --> 00:13.219
<i>of one of the Omega keys.</i>

00:16.590 --> 00:17.523
Scrap!

00:17.592 --> 00:21.594
It appears identical to the
one taken from me by Optimus Prime.

00:21.662 --> 00:24.263
Pieces of a larger puzzle, perhaps.

00:26.300 --> 00:30.970
Alpha Trion said we need all four
keys to restore Cybertron, remember?

00:31.038 --> 00:34.006
We just need to hang on to the
one we have, find a way to get

00:34.075 --> 00:35.507
the others back from Megatron.

00:35.576 --> 00:39.144
The final entry has been decoded.

00:39.213 --> 00:43.782
The coordinates are forming an image.

00:43.851 --> 00:45.150
Smokescreen?

00:45.219 --> 00:49.622
Prime's latest recruit is the
final relic of Iacon!

00:52.759 --> 00:54.627
No!

00:55.628 --> 00:58.628
<b>2x23 - Inside Job</b>

01:02.336 --> 01:04.703
Wakey, wakey.

01:04.772 --> 01:07.640
What?!

01:11.711 --> 01:16.715
If you're looking for your
Phase Shifter, finders keepers.

01:16.784 --> 01:19.051
<i>Enough prattling, Knockout!</i>

01:19.120 --> 01:22.921
Hand me the final Iacon relic ...
now.

01:22.990 --> 01:27.326
Yeah, I can't really help you.
That's the only one I was packing.

01:27.395 --> 01:29.328
Soundwave.

01:33.334 --> 01:34.900
You got the wrong guy, chief.

01:34.969 --> 01:38.504
Optimus Prime's the one who can
decode the Iacon database.

01:38.572 --> 01:41.440
Ah, but you misunderstand.

01:41.509 --> 01:45.177
The final entry has been
decoded by us!

01:45.246 --> 01:50.199
And according to our findings,
it would appear I do indeed

01:50.200 --> 01:52.117
have the right guy.

01:52.121 --> 01:56.624
The question is, what is it
that you are still packing?

01:59.030 --> 02:02.799
Why, hidden treasure, of course!

02:52.028 --> 02:56.765
<i>Smokescreen must have been
taken aboard the Decepticon warship. </i>

02:56.834 --> 03:00.802
Tracing his signal through its
shielding will be impossible.

03:00.871 --> 03:03.638
Continue monitoring all
frequencies, Ratchet.

03:03.707 --> 03:06.775
Far more than Smokescreen's
fate may be at stake.

03:06.844 --> 03:11.680
I... don't get it.
How could Smoke be an Omega key?

03:11.749 --> 03:15.550
Perhaps he isn't the key,
but its container.

03:15.619 --> 03:19.387
The other Iacon relics were sent
to Earth in pods. Why not this one?

03:19.456 --> 03:22.991
When the Decepticons stormed
Iacon, it may have been too late

03:23.060 --> 03:27.629
for Alpha Trion to launch the
final Omega key into space ...

03:27.698 --> 03:30.198
at least, by standard means.

03:30.399 --> 03:34.536
So Smokescreen assumed everything went
black because he was hit by Decepticons.

03:34.605 --> 03:38.840
But Alpha Trion's the one who
actually turned out the kid's lights.

03:38.909 --> 03:42.644
It stands to reason that my
mentor did not want Smokescreen

03:42.713 --> 03:46.448
to know what he was carrying
in the event of capture.

03:46.517 --> 03:50.819
And with a mobile relic, Alpha Trion
couldn't possibly supply fixed coordinates.

03:50.888 --> 03:55.657
So the big "A" slipped us a clue instead...
Smoke's mug shot.

03:55.726 --> 03:58.527
The Decepticons got to
Smokescreen first.

03:58.595 --> 04:02.664
I fear they have decoded the same clue.

04:07.804 --> 04:10.739
Yet another of
these identical relics?

04:10.808 --> 04:15.043
- Remove it swiftly.
- With pleasure.

04:15.112 --> 04:19.848
I do so resent a finish
flashier than my own.

04:26.990 --> 04:29.357
Ha! Made you squirm.

04:36.132 --> 04:37.999
Trippy.

04:40.636 --> 04:42.571
And intuitive.

04:42.639 --> 04:46.875
Proper grounding ensures that its
user won't phase through the floor.

04:46.944 --> 04:49.744
I said swiftly.

04:52.482 --> 04:55.083
Get your stinkin'
hand out of my gears!

04:55.152 --> 04:59.254
Mm, and...
got you!

05:08.064 --> 05:11.333
Tell me the function of these relics.

05:11.401 --> 05:14.569
Doorstops? Shavers? Bling?
Beats me.

05:14.638 --> 05:16.872
Hmm.
A pity this little gadget won't

05:16.940 --> 05:22.177
allow me to just reach into his
brain pan and pluck out the info.

05:22.246 --> 05:27.649
Fortunately, we possess
a device that can.

05:27.718 --> 05:32.287
<i>Individually, each of these
so-called Omega keys is useless.</i>

05:32.356 --> 05:37.058
Yet possessing even a single one
grants me tremendous negotiating

05:37.127 --> 05:42.364
power with either
Autobots or Decepticons.

05:42.432 --> 05:47.736
Still, imagine if I manage to
acquire the other three.

06:05.354 --> 06:09.791
I could revive Cybertron and
seize the throne as

06:09.860 --> 06:16.097
Starscream I., supreme overlord
and emperor of destruction!

06:18.335 --> 06:19.901
A-ha... eh...

06:20.970 --> 06:22.647
But unlike Megatron,

06:22.648 --> 06:26.775
I lack the necessary infrastructure
to enforce such a reign.

06:26.843 --> 06:32.080
No warship, no army ...
only my meager laboratory finds,

06:32.149 --> 06:35.917
a ground-bridge remote control,
a single remaining dose of

06:35.986 --> 06:41.223
Red Energon,
and you, old friend.

06:42.292 --> 06:45.961
But I would all too gladly trade this

06:45.962 --> 06:49.631
simply to be restored
to my former glory.

06:51.767 --> 06:55.870
While I am unfamiliar with
the lore of these Omega keys,

06:55.939 --> 07:00.075
Alpha Trion knew many secrets,
and the ancients possessed

07:00.143 --> 07:02.594
technology that has long been lost

07:02.595 --> 07:05.046
to what we consider modern science.

07:05.115 --> 07:08.950
Whatever their function,
this much is certain.

07:09.019 --> 07:16.391
We cannot restore Cybertron without
all four Omega keys in our possession.

07:16.460 --> 07:20.395
<i>The future of our home world
depends on it.</i>

07:26.736 --> 07:29.671
That's a wrap.

07:39.582 --> 07:43.985
The power to remake
Cybertron as I see fit.

07:46.922 --> 07:53.194
I will pry the other two keys from
Optimus Prime's lifeless fingers.

07:53.263 --> 07:56.331
We must find the exact location
of the Autobot base.

07:56.400 --> 08:01.202
Patch in and tear apart
Smokescreen's mind, if you must.

08:01.271 --> 08:02.570
Me?

08:02.639 --> 08:06.741
Who else?
Do you think I would entrust you

08:06.810 --> 08:10.912
to see this key safely to the
vault containing the other one?

08:19.855 --> 08:23.324
Once more, into the brain pan.

08:23.393 --> 08:26.494
No! Not again!
Stay out of my head!

08:27.597 --> 08:31.032
Now, now. You'll only make
things worse for yourself.

08:33.770 --> 08:36.538
Worse how?

08:58.060 --> 09:00.695
Well, aren't you the clever one?

09:04.634 --> 09:08.603
This is ship is miles in the sky
and swarming with Decepticons!

09:08.672 --> 09:14.843
- Do you really think you can escape?
- Who says I'm lookin' to escape?

09:50.346 --> 09:53.648
Think fast!

09:53.717 --> 09:55.116
What?!

10:04.693 --> 10:07.562
No!!!

10:20.276 --> 10:22.143
Oh, this isn't the way out?

10:53.143 --> 10:55.009
The keys.

11:04.853 --> 11:07.755
A pity you are incapable of flight.

11:07.824 --> 11:12.193
Yeah, like I'm
gonna let that stop me.

11:34.834 --> 11:37.402
Smokescreen's signal,
it's back online!

11:37.471 --> 11:39.671
The kid escaped the warship!

11:39.740 --> 11:44.643
Smokescreen to base.
I could really use a ground bridge.

11:46.813 --> 11:50.682
Retrieve the Omega keys!
Quickly!

11:58.992 --> 12:02.027
Fliers! I need fliers!

12:06.365 --> 12:08.200
Setting coordinates.

12:08.669 --> 12:11.303
- Strange.
- What's the problem?

12:11.371 --> 12:16.341
Smokescreen's telemetry data doesn't
make sense. I can't lock onto his position.

12:33.760 --> 12:36.395
I've isolated the problem.

12:36.396 --> 12:39.030
Smokescreen is in free fall.

12:39.099 --> 12:44.169
<i>Smokescreen, I'm opening the
ground bridge directly below you.</i>

12:46.606 --> 12:48.874
Brace yourselves.
I'm gonna make an entrance.

12:55.182 --> 12:57.516
He's... off course.

12:57.584 --> 13:00.685
- You missed?
- Open another one ... fast!

13:04.357 --> 13:08.326
I hope proper grounding on this
thing doesn't apply to actual ground.

13:31.117 --> 13:32.984
No!

13:39.959 --> 13:42.711
Scour the wreckage!

13:42.712 --> 13:45.463
I want those keys!

13:51.237 --> 13:52.404
<i>Hey, Ratchet.</i>

13:52.472 --> 13:57.108
<i>I could still really use that
ground bridge.</i>

13:57.177 --> 13:59.478
<i>Did I tell you?</i>

14:00.247 --> 14:05.350
Destiny!
Alpha Trion knew I'd keep it safe.

14:07.454 --> 14:08.753
Nice work, kid.

14:12.759 --> 14:15.026
It was the only key in
Megatron's vault.

14:15.095 --> 14:17.729
Then three keys are accounted for.

14:17.798 --> 14:21.700
Then the fourth is still
somewhere on the Cons' warship.

14:21.768 --> 14:28.006
Unless... Megatron
never had it to begin with?

14:28.075 --> 14:33.211
A high-frequency signal...
with an embedded message.

14:33.580 --> 14:35.714
Starscream.

14:35.782 --> 14:38.884
"I have obtained something of
interest to you which seems to

14:38.952 --> 14:41.453
be of no practical use to me."

14:41.521 --> 14:44.789
- It's got to be the Omega key!
- He's the one who blindsided me!

14:44.858 --> 14:46.892
What else could
Scream be referring to?

14:46.960 --> 14:48.960
Ep, ep!
There's more.

14:49.029 --> 14:55.901
"Bring medical kit. I only ask for the
surgical replacement of my T-Cog in return."

14:56.737 --> 14:59.537
Like we're gonna give scream
back his wings.

14:59.606 --> 15:04.009
Without the missing key,
Cybertron will remain devoid of life.

15:04.077 --> 15:07.812
Broken record, I know, but...
it could be a trick.

15:07.881 --> 15:10.982
It is possible that
Starscream does not yet realize

15:11.051 --> 15:13.818
the significance of what he holds.

15:13.887 --> 15:18.557
And we do know that he's been
incapable of flight for some time.

15:18.825 --> 15:23.795
The stakes are too great for us
not to consider Starscream's proposal.

15:23.864 --> 15:27.666
However, we will take precautions.

15:46.719 --> 15:49.154
There.

15:49.222 --> 15:53.692
Starscream, show us the
Omega key.

16:01.634 --> 16:03.501
Give it up, Scream.

16:06.439 --> 16:07.238
Huh?

16:07.307 --> 16:11.576
We're too late.
The T-Cog won't help him now.

16:29.328 --> 16:33.398
It would seem I have the run
of the place.

16:50.987 --> 16:55.290
Oh, how easy it would be to gut you.

17:02.632 --> 17:06.920
To gut all of you.
But...

17:06.921 --> 17:10.472
...first thing's first.

17:10.540 --> 17:14.877
Where does Optimus keep his key ring?

17:16.046 --> 17:17.579
Not here.

17:17.948 --> 17:19.146
Nope.

17:19.415 --> 17:20.550
No.

17:22.719 --> 17:27.989
Bleh, I was wondering what
happened to that wretch.

17:28.892 --> 17:31.494
Do they think I have all day?

17:32.563 --> 17:34.930
Ah, there you are.

17:41.538 --> 17:46.975
Curious. Starscream has been
deceased for quite some time.

17:47.044 --> 17:50.712
Well, how's that possible if
he just sent us a message?

17:50.781 --> 17:52.981
We have been deceived.

18:03.392 --> 18:07.963
- Whoa! Whoa!
- What was that?

18:09.533 --> 18:12.968
<i>Arcee, close the ground
bridge now.</i>

18:30.386 --> 18:35.457
Now that I have your trinkets,
I'm free to enjoy slitting your ...

18:40.897 --> 18:44.900
But, as I appear to
be pressed for time...

19:04.388 --> 19:15.764
<i>Autobots, maintain positions!</i>

19:17.934 --> 19:19.734
I'm sorry. What was that?

19:23.540 --> 19:29.811
You Autobots think you're so superior,
but do you know what you really are?

19:29.880 --> 19:31.746
Slow!

19:37.754 --> 19:43.058
- The red Energon wore off, didn't it?
- He has the Omega keys!

19:47.898 --> 19:49.831
Come on!

20:10.886 --> 20:12.120
We'll get them back.

20:12.189 --> 20:15.991
The keys can be of no use to
Starscream while he scrounges in

20:16.059 --> 20:18.093
the wild like some scraplet.

20:18.161 --> 20:22.530
There must be something that we
can offer him in exchange.

20:22.599 --> 20:29.237
The fate of Cybertron now
rests in Starscream's hands...

20:29.306 --> 20:32.173
whatever his intention.

20:35.544 --> 20:40.015
<i>I beg you, my liege, release
me from this absurd predicament!</i>

20:42.451 --> 20:49.724
No! You shall serve as a constant
reminder to those who dare fail me.

20:55.364 --> 20:59.634
I cannot allow Optimus Prime to
be the one to revive Cybertron.

20:59.703 --> 21:04.739
We will locate the Autobot base,
invade it, and retrieve the Omega keys.

21:04.808 --> 21:06.492
<i>Been there...</i>

21:06.493 --> 21:08.176
done that.

21:10.479 --> 21:14.182
Please pardon my unannounced
visit, lord Megatron.

21:19.188 --> 21:23.158
But I have come bearing
a peace offering.
