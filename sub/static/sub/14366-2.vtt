00:01.054 --> 00:04.289
<i>Previously on "Transformers Prime"...</i>

00:05.392 --> 00:08.058
No, don't move or talk.
Just power down.

00:08.128 --> 00:10.628
<i>A new power dominates your world.</i>

00:10.697 --> 00:13.076
<i>Any further attempts to attack me</i>

00:13.080 --> 00:15.960
<i>will be met with even greater force!</i>

00:16.830 --> 00:19.770
<i>Miko, no cellphone!
You know the rules!</i>

00:21.070 --> 00:24.040
One text couldn't hurt, could it?

00:25.110 --> 00:28.010
I realize Optimus sent us all
to different locations to make

00:28.080 --> 00:30.910
us harder for the 'Cons to find,
but if we don't know where in

00:30.980 --> 00:34.450
the world anyone else went, how
are we gonna find them?

00:34.520 --> 00:38.060
You'll tell me the
location of your compatriots,

00:38.130 --> 00:41.590
no matter what it takes
or how long.

00:41.660 --> 00:45.900
Assemble a team and disembark
for Cybertron immediately.

00:47.600 --> 00:50.370
He lives?

00:53.440 --> 00:55.340
Shockwave!

00:59.210 --> 01:00.680
Lord Megatron.

01:00.750 --> 01:05.720
Shockwave! This is
quite an unexpected turn.

01:05.780 --> 01:07.580
I thought you'd perished on
Cybertron.

01:08.820 --> 01:11.220
Yes, as ... as did we all.

01:11.290 --> 01:16.830
Reports of my demise were
greatly premature.

01:16.900 --> 01:20.700
<i>A pair of Autobots infiltrated
my facility on Cybertron,</i>

01:20.770 --> 01:23.820
<i>sabotaging my space bridge.</i>

01:25.110 --> 01:30.340
<i>I gave chase but failed to
accurately calculate the outcome.</i>

01:37.220 --> 01:42.390
<i>I awoke in the rubble, blinded.
It soon became clear that I was</i>

01:42.450 --> 01:47.190
<i>marooned on our dead planet
with no means of communication.</i>

01:47.260 --> 01:52.460
<i>In time, I repaired my wounds
and resumed my experiments.</i>

01:52.530 --> 01:56.230
<i>The solitude enabled me to make
tremendous advances in my research.</i>

01:58.170 --> 02:00.641
<i>Until one day, my instruments</i>

02:00.641 --> 02:03.070
<i>detected a massive surge of
unidentifiable energy.</i>

02:06.250 --> 02:09.550
<i>I traveled to investigate its
origin at the edge of the</i>

02:09.620 --> 02:13.220
<i>Sea of Rust, where I encountered
your salvage team and</i>

02:13.290 --> 02:16.490
<i>the smoldering wreckage of the
Omega Lock.</i>

02:16.560 --> 02:22.460
<i>But this was not the search party
I had anticipated so long ago.</i>

02:24.530 --> 02:28.600
Leaving one unanswered question.

02:28.670 --> 02:33.340
Why was I left for scrap, abandoned?

02:33.410 --> 02:35.340
Why?

02:39.250 --> 02:42.120

03:13.320 --> 03:15.020
The ... the ...
the explosion, it ...

03:15.090 --> 03:17.550
it collapsed the power-core chamber.

03:17.620 --> 03:20.555
The last thing anyone witnessed
was you charging into

03:20.555 --> 03:24.990
the space-bridge portal.
No one saw you come back out!

03:25.060 --> 03:28.590
I find your reply to be...

03:28.590 --> 03:31.230
logical.

03:35.240 --> 03:38.880
But you will be pleased to know
that I avenged your seeming

03:38.940 --> 03:43.410
demise by personally terminating
the Autobot Cliffjumper.

03:44.280 --> 03:45.750
Careful, Starscream.

03:45.820 --> 03:49.550
You may dislocate a landing gear
patting yourself on the back.

03:49.620 --> 03:53.290
As Megatron's First Lieutenant,
allow me to welcome

03:53.360 --> 03:57.530
<i>you back to the winning team.</i>

03:57.600 --> 04:01.860
And allow me to clarify the
new chain of command.

04:01.930 --> 04:05.000
While Starscream will retain
authority over military

04:05.070 --> 04:08.940
operations, Shockwave
will be my First Lieutenant

04:09.070 --> 04:12.310
in charge of all scientific endeavors.

04:12.510 --> 04:18.310
Uh, so you are saying we
shall each report directly to you.

04:18.380 --> 04:20.250
Affirmative.

04:24.820 --> 04:28.430
Completely logical, my liege.

04:29.490 --> 04:31.530
<i>Hey, you hungry?
There's a town up ahead.</i>

04:31.600 --> 04:33.600
I'd better not.
I'm running low on cash.

04:33.670 --> 04:36.600
<i>At least you don't have to
buy gasoline.</i>

04:36.670 --> 04:39.900
<i>I'm pulling over anyway.
Need to stretch my legs.</i>

04:49.410 --> 04:51.220
Oh, yeah.

04:53.280 --> 04:56.890
Arcee... team Prime is
scattered to the winds.

04:56.960 --> 05:00.920
For all we know, you and I could
be the only ones left.

05:00.990 --> 05:04.390
I don't believe that, Jack,
and I know you don't either.

05:04.460 --> 05:09.300
Maybe not. But the Decepticons
outnumber us 100 to 1.

05:09.370 --> 05:11.970
Aren't there any more Autobots
out there who could help?

05:12.040 --> 05:15.340
The war for Cybertron took a heavy toll.

05:15.410 --> 05:17.940
But there were others who
escaped in the ark.

05:18.010 --> 05:19.890
So, where are they?

05:22.890 --> 05:25.550
Scattered to the winds.

05:27.850 --> 05:31.250
So, let's focus on
getting back to Jasper

05:31.260 --> 05:34.660
and getting team Prime back together.

05:42.400 --> 05:43.130
Nada, Bee.

05:43.200 --> 05:46.140
Just the same old rubber masks
and bad C.G., but the usual

05:46.200 --> 05:48.800
conspiracy websites might
be our only chance to...

05:49.570 --> 05:51.840
Whoa!
I found something!

05:54.640 --> 05:56.380
<i>It's Ratchet!</i>

06:02.950 --> 06:06.320
Shockwave's toadying is so
transparent.

06:06.390 --> 06:10.490
Megatron's respect is
earned by deeds, not words.

06:10.560 --> 06:12.700
<i>Useless, useless, useless.</i>

06:12.760 --> 06:16.400
<i>Billions of cameras in the hands
of those miserable humans.</i>

06:16.470 --> 06:22.210
<i>One of them is bound to
catch an Autobot eventually.</i>

06:22.670 --> 06:26.980
Well, well, well.
What have we here?

06:27.050 --> 06:31.880
Lord Megatron, I have found
something of great interest!

06:31.950 --> 06:36.050
The photo was taken yesterday
in a junkyard outside Woodland Park.

06:36.120 --> 06:41.020
I'd better scrub Ratchet and
replace him with...

06:41.390 --> 06:43.090
An Autobot!

06:49.700 --> 06:51.300
Wait, what?

06:51.370 --> 06:53.800
It was just here!
Surely, one of you saw it.

06:55.210 --> 06:59.810
Starscream...
you would do well to take a cue

06:59.880 --> 07:03.980
from Soundwave on occasion
and keep things to yourself!

07:05.780 --> 07:09.920
Vow of silence ...
such a cop-out.

07:09.990 --> 07:13.060
Lord Megatron, surely our
Autobot prisoner is a better

07:13.120 --> 07:15.930
source of information than
this primitive data net.

07:15.990 --> 07:18.790
I will have you know,
Shockwave, that I have been

07:18.860 --> 07:21.200
grinding Wheeljack down for days.

07:21.270 --> 07:25.300
If he knew anything, he
would've spilled it by now.

07:25.370 --> 07:31.970
Again, some prove to be better
at holding their tongues than others.

07:32.040 --> 07:36.580
Perhaps you would have better results
if instead of a club you used a scalpel.

07:36.650 --> 07:40.320
I recommend a cortical psychic patch.

07:43.190 --> 07:46.060
I don't think he's coming.

07:48.130 --> 07:51.890
Don't worry, Miko ... every
Wrecker knows the protocol.

07:51.960 --> 07:53.300
Jackie will show.

07:54.730 --> 07:57.130
If he's still kicking.

07:57.130 --> 07:59.540
Do your worst, Doc.

07:59.600 --> 08:04.310
I'm a Wrecker.
I can take it.

08:04.380 --> 08:08.910
Trust me...
you, in fact, cannot.

08:19.320 --> 08:21.960
The patch failed to yield any
new information on the

08:22.030 --> 08:23.660
whereabouts of the Autobots.

08:24.930 --> 08:25.590
I see.

08:25.660 --> 08:30.670
Ah, then it would seem that
Wheeljack has outlived his usefulness.

08:30.740 --> 08:34.243
With your permission, Lord Megatron,

08:34.243 --> 08:39.110
I will see to his immediate termination.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.550
<i>Wake up, Wrecker.</i>

08:52.250 --> 08:56.440
<i>Time to smelt.</i>

08:56.510 --> 08:59.850
Commander Starscream wanted
you conscious so you'd know

08:59.910 --> 09:02.320
precisely who ordered your execution.

09:02.380 --> 09:03.920
Where is Screamy?

09:03.920 --> 09:06.990
Doesn't have the bearings
to do this himself?

09:16.060 --> 09:21.130
- Jump.
- Hey, are you a flier?

09:27.010 --> 09:28.870
Okay, I'll jump.

09:36.350 --> 09:37.720
Thought so!

09:53.430 --> 09:55.300
Thanks for the ride.

10:40.480 --> 10:43.150
This is how you handle things?!

10:43.220 --> 10:48.020
Wheeljack is not the first prisoner
to escape Starscream's care.

10:48.090 --> 10:52.830
Actually, master, I allowed
Wheeljack to escape.

10:52.890 --> 10:54.760
You what?!

10:54.830 --> 11:02.100
But the Autobot's every move,
his every word, will be monitored.

11:02.170 --> 11:05.670
Thanks to a simple tracking
device implanted while the prisoner

11:05.750 --> 11:10.880
was still unconscious, following
the failed cortical psychic patch.

11:12.050 --> 11:16.320
Now all we have to do is wait,
watch, and listen.

11:16.380 --> 11:21.100
When the Wrecker reunites
with the other Autobots,

11:21.100 --> 11:23.460
my armada will strike.

11:31.130 --> 11:32.870
He's got to be here.

11:44.210 --> 11:49.550
Ratchet!
Ratchet, it's me, Raf!

11:49.620 --> 11:51.520
Uh, Ratchet?

11:51.590 --> 11:53.490
<i>Go away!</i>

11:55.090 --> 11:57.790
<i>You're interrupting my power down.</i>

11:58.730 --> 12:01.890
Come on, Ratchet, we need
your help to find the others.

12:04.630 --> 12:08.270
<i>We can't stop Megatron,
not anymore.</i>

12:08.340 --> 12:12.070
<i>The war is over, and we lost.</i>

12:12.140 --> 12:16.140
You're giving up?!
We can't just give up!

12:16.410 --> 12:20.210
Then tell me what we can do
without communications, without

12:20.280 --> 12:25.080
a ground bridge, without a base of
operations or resources of any kind!

12:27.160 --> 12:29.920
Bee's right. We know
Starscream had access to

12:29.990 --> 12:32.320
a ground bridge while
he was operating solo.

12:32.390 --> 12:36.900
Yes, yes, he'd clearly been using the
derelict Decepticon ship the Harbinger.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.900
What does that have
to do with anything?!

12:38.970 --> 12:41.830
It could be full of
Cybertronian tech, and it's probably

12:41.840 --> 12:44.700
abandoned again now that
Starscream's back with the 'Cons.

12:45.840 --> 12:51.710
Well, resources won't be of much
use, not without someone to...

12:51.780 --> 12:54.480
- lead us.
- It's a start!

12:54.550 --> 12:59.650
You'll have to start without me.
This is someone else's fight now.

12:59.720 --> 13:04.820
There is no one else, Ratchet...
just us, just the team.

13:06.630 --> 13:09.930
Please!

13:11.100 --> 13:14.530
<i>Just let me...
rust in peace.</i>

13:16.670 --> 13:19.070
Come on, Bee.

13:37.320 --> 13:39.260
I'm back.

13:44.630 --> 13:47.230
I combed through every square
micron of our old base.

13:47.300 --> 13:50.470
I couldn't find Ratchet's
medical kit, not even a bandage.

13:50.540 --> 13:55.810
<i>The Forge...
of Solus Prime.</i>

13:55.880 --> 13:59.140
It's gone, too.
The 'Cons picked the place clean.

14:03.280 --> 14:06.550
Wait, if you had the Forge,
you could fix yourself up ...

14:06.620 --> 14:10.090
power of the Primes.
Optimus, hang on just a little longer.

14:10.160 --> 14:16.460
That hammer's got to be
somewhere in Megatron's fortress.

14:33.150 --> 14:34.350
<i>Miko, wake up.</i>

14:37.520 --> 14:41.590
- Why?
- Someone's coming.

14:53.330 --> 14:57.140
I'd know the hum of
that engine anywhere!

15:03.810 --> 15:07.580
Jackie!
Where have you been, buddy?!

15:07.650 --> 15:10.480
Catching up with a few old
dance partners.

15:13.550 --> 15:14.920
Good to see you, kid.

15:14.990 --> 15:18.390
Safe to assume we're the only
three Wreckers around?

15:18.460 --> 15:21.930
So, what are we waiting for?
Let's do some damage!

15:22.000 --> 15:25.330
<i>What's our next move,
Jackie ... circle back to base?</i>

15:25.400 --> 15:28.730
<i>There is no base.
'Cons blasted it to dust.</i>

15:28.800 --> 15:31.940
The dimwit played right into
my hands.

15:33.440 --> 15:37.610
All seekers to the flight deck!
We have pinpointed the enemy!

15:45.990 --> 15:50.560
Attack!
My armada.

16:09.180 --> 16:11.510
We're at the coordinates,
Commander Starscream.

16:11.580 --> 16:15.210
Hold fast. They are
approaching your position.

16:28.630 --> 16:31.000
Targets in range?

16:39.370 --> 16:42.110
And boom.

16:42.170 --> 16:46.010
Grenade!

16:47.750 --> 16:50.350
He ... he tricked us!

16:55.050 --> 16:57.660
How'd you know the 'Cons
planted a tracker on you?

16:57.720 --> 17:00.690
I figured the 'Cons were up
to something, so I did a little

17:00.760 --> 17:02.630
poking around under my hood.

17:04.030 --> 17:06.960
- That's my Jackie.
- So, what's our next move?

17:07.030 --> 17:13.240
I salvaged some munitions from
the Jackhammer on my way out.

17:13.310 --> 17:15.069
<i>You thought that made a loud noise?</i>

17:16.040 --> 17:18.410
<i>Just wait.</i>

17:31.160 --> 17:32.990
Hold it right there, Bee.

17:33.060 --> 17:33.960
And...

17:34.030 --> 17:36.960
...powering up!

17:41.570 --> 17:44.800
Keep trying.
We'll figure it out.

17:50.140 --> 17:53.480
You're miscalibrating the
Energon transducer.

17:53.550 --> 17:58.450
- Ratchet!
- Now step out of my way so I can work.

18:07.490 --> 18:09.760
The last time things looked
this bleak, Optimus slipped me

18:09.830 --> 18:12.600
that key card ... something we
could hang our hopes on.

18:12.670 --> 18:14.800
<i>I know you're feeling helpless, Jack.</i>

18:14.870 --> 18:19.370
<i>This doesn't need to be your
burden.</i>

18:19.940 --> 18:22.140
Whoa!

18:35.720 --> 18:37.590
Stay behind me.

18:51.270 --> 18:53.970
Jack, I don't think we're
gonna need that key card.

19:01.050 --> 19:04.980
<i>Meet Ultra Magnus.</i>

19:05.050 --> 19:08.550
<i>So, not only did you fail to
destroy the Autobots but you</i>

19:08.620 --> 19:11.390
allowed their number to increase!

19:11.460 --> 19:14.560
Is there no one who can
bring me their heads?!

19:14.630 --> 19:16.560
If I may, lord Megatron.

19:16.630 --> 19:21.420
During my exile on Cybertron, I resumed
work on a long-dormant project...

19:21.420 --> 19:26.200
<i>one that I believe may provide a
solution to our current problem.</i>

19:26.270 --> 19:28.840
Cyber nucleic acid?

19:28.840 --> 19:31.410
<i>The building blocks of all
Cybertronian life.</i>

19:31.480 --> 19:35.250
<i>This hails from a specimen I
excavated upon our planet and</i>

19:35.310 --> 19:37.780
<i>has yielded promising results.</i>

19:37.850 --> 19:41.030
The Autobots continue to
evade us.

19:41.030 --> 19:43.950
What makes you think we can
afford to wait for the answer to

19:44.020 --> 19:48.240
our prayers to be birth
in some Petri dish?

19:48.240 --> 19:52.090
You misunderstand. The
subject has been fully cultivated.

19:52.090 --> 19:56.530
It need only be transported from
my laboratory on Cybertron.

19:56.600 --> 20:02.240
Then by all means,
activate the space bridge.

21:01.630 --> 21:05.000
