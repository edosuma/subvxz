You just bumped your head.

00:14.984 --> 00:17.017
I told your mom we're going
to get it checked out.

00:17.084 --> 00:18.448
We just need to get
to the hospital now.

00:18.516 --> 00:19.848
Why don't we just
take an ambulance?

00:19.916 --> 00:22.548
Because your Aunt Annie
is much faster.

00:24.717 --> 00:26.883
Oh! Excuse me.

00:29.352 --> 00:31.550
Excuse me. My niece
fell and bumped her head.

00:31.618 --> 00:34.520
I'm Dr. Weiss,

00:34.588 --> 00:38.327
I'm Annie Walker,

- Chloe.

00:44.269 --> 00:45.571
How long ago did she fall?

00:45.639 --> 00:48.675
Nine minutes
and 48 seconds ago.

No.

The Agency's having
an emergency of its own.

02:26.451 --> 02:27.852
An instructor at the Farm

02:27.919 --> 02:29.220
leaked the identity
of a top recruit.

02:29.288 --> 02:30.855
The name's Roy Gaskin.

02:30.923 --> 02:33.125
He's a weapons, tactics,
and training instructor.

02:33.193 --> 02:34.794
Why don't I recognize him?

02:34.862 --> 02:36.229
He was transferred
after you were pulled.

02:36.296 --> 02:38.699
A trainee he burned
is Laura Taylor.

02:38.766 --> 02:40.167

she was a linguist

02:40.235 --> 02:41.902

02:41.970 --> 02:43.638
in multiple European
and Slavic languages.

were posted

02:53.250 --> 02:56.018
Past 12 years, Roy ran ops
in Iran and Afghanistan.

02:56.086 --> 02:57.720
During his last assignment,

02:57.787 --> 02:59.755
he was captured by militants
in the Logar Province.

02:59.823 --> 03:01.523
That's when we think
he was turned.

03:01.591 --> 03:04.193
Under duress, even the best
operatives can be turned.

03:04.261 --> 03:05.928
Couple that
with unexplained absences,

03:05.996 --> 03:08.097

and we have our mole.

03:08.165 --> 03:09.431
Why hasn't he been pulled?

03:09.499 --> 03:11.133
No hard evidence.

03:11.201 --> 03:13.468

to an I.P. address

03:13.536 --> 03:15.103
in the general area
of the Farm,

03:15.171 --> 03:16.305
but it's not
Roy's work computer.

03:16.373 --> 03:17.340

for going back to the Farm.

10:16.434 --> 10:18.202
They're gonna post
the new rankings soon.

10:18.270 --> 10:19.837
Oh, and lights out
is at 9:00.

10:19.905 --> 10:21.739
You don't really
go to sleep at 9:00, do you?

10:21.806 --> 10:25.909
Yes, I do.
Every night.

10:25.977 --> 10:28.812
- Course you do.
- What?

10:28.880 --> 10:30.414
I'll see you
down at the bar.

10:35.854 --> 10:37.688
[Knocking at door]

10:40.326 --> 10:41.859
I was hoping
I could have a word.

10:41.927 --> 10:46.130
Yeah, sure.
What's on your mind?

10:46.198 --> 10:47.899
I think I've done
a pretty good job

10:47.967 --> 10:49.334
of filling in
where I was needed.

10:49.402 --> 10:50.935
No argument here.

10:51.003 --> 10:54.005
Thing is, given my skills,
my experience,

10:54.073 --> 10:56.241
I'm not the guy
that should be filling in.

10:56.309 --> 10:58.276
Let's face it.
Anyone else would have

10:58.344 --> 11:00.546
made a play for
the corner office by now,

11:00.613 --> 11:02.414
or gone over to the NSA.

11:02.482 --> 11:05.083
To get a better office and
a parking space to go with it?

11:05.151 --> 11:10.422
I stayed because I assumed my
responsibilities would expand.

11:10.490 --> 11:12.791
Well, you're welcome
to hand in your resignation

11:12.859 --> 11:15.093
if you'd like.

11:15.161 --> 11:17.396
Hmm.

11:17.463 --> 11:19.064
I assume there'll be
some fallout

11:19.131 --> 11:20.865
from the case against Arthur.

11:20.933 --> 11:23.001
The situation's
being handled.

11:23.069 --> 11:26.572
Nobody's expecting Arthur to
get marched out of the building.

11:26.640 --> 11:28.374
I mean,
if it happens at all,

11:28.441 --> 11:31.244
it'll start slowly.

11:31.311 --> 11:34.614
First Arthur's people
in the Tanzania station

11:34.682 --> 11:37.083
will get shipped back
to Langley.

11:37.151 --> 11:39.853
Then the station chief
in Stockholm will get the boot.

11:39.920 --> 11:40.920
You done?

11:40.988 --> 11:42.622
Just being frank here.

11:42.690 --> 11:45.759
And you've succeeded,
and now I have work to do.

11:51.499 --> 11:52.899
[Door closes]

11:52.967 --> 11:56.270
Now, we can't move forward
until all the questions

11:56.337 --> 11:58.605
regarding the CIA cover-up
have been answered.

11:58.672 --> 12:00.606
I personally tried
to get Arthur Campbell

12:00.674 --> 12:02.942
on the telephone many times.

12:03.010 --> 12:07.880
I mean, I've said, "Let's sit
down and talk about this."

12:07.948 --> 12:09.615
I couldn't help it.

12:09.683 --> 12:10.683
Why not
just meet with him?

12:10.751 --> 12:12.518
He's a power-hungry senator.

12:12.586 --> 12:14.654
A sit-down would only
further inflate his ego.

12:14.722 --> 12:17.390
And he'll use it
to come after me even harder.

12:17.458 --> 12:20.026
Or it could silence him.

12:20.093 --> 12:22.261
Talking to Gottfried
won't resolve our legal issues.

12:22.329 --> 12:23.963
We've hired Chet
to handle the case,

12:24.031 --> 12:26.332
and that'll have to be enough.

12:26.399 --> 12:29.268
For now.

12:35.674 --> 12:38.175
I bet this is
what Laura misses most.

12:38.243 --> 12:39.610
She loved it.

12:39.678 --> 12:40.911
The root beer?

12:40.979 --> 12:42.713
Oh, her family was strict.

12:42.781 --> 12:44.448
Didn't allow soda.

12:52.259 --> 12:56.029
What? No, wait.
How is this possible?

12:56.096 --> 12:57.797
Whoa.
Way to go, Annie Oakley.

12:57.865 --> 12:59.633
[Laughs]
Number one.

12:59.701 --> 13:01.001
After one exercise.

13:01.069 --> 13:02.403
Well, no,
rankings are cumulative.

13:02.470 --> 13:03.971
Annie must have
aced all the exercises

13:04.039 --> 13:06.173
before her injury.

13:10.311 --> 13:12.545
She's mad because she thought
she had the top spot in the bag

13:12.613 --> 13:14.147
after Laura was cut.

13:14.215 --> 13:16.182
Yeah, it's--
it's not a big deal.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.184
Oh, right.
Yeah, it only determines whether

13:18.252 --> 13:21.153
you get to be James Bond
or James not-so-Bond.

13:21.221 --> 13:22.688
Top third of the class

13:22.755 --> 13:24.322
is gonna work
in clandestine operations.

13:24.390 --> 13:26.391
Mm-hmm, and the bottom third
will be like me,

13:26.459 --> 13:28.760
working D.S.T.
at a Langley.

13:28.828 --> 13:30.696
Don't get me wrong.

13:30.764 --> 13:32.331
That's where I want to be,
with all the high-tech toys.

13:32.399 --> 13:33.533
My dad says we're not
gonna use half the stuff

13:33.600 --> 13:34.867
we're being
tested on anyways--

13:34.935 --> 13:37.771
seals and flaps,
lock picking, detection routes.

13:37.839 --> 13:39.540
Yeah, I'd--I'd love
to get to D.S.T.

13:39.608 --> 13:42.009
without having
to jump out of a plane.

13:42.077 --> 13:43.511
[Laughter]

13:43.579 --> 13:45.513
Aw.
Well, maybe the cocktail parties

13:45.581 --> 13:48.216
will help some tech guys
be a little less dull.

13:48.283 --> 13:50.484
Now there's a skill
we're gonna use in Kabul,

13:50.552 --> 13:54.088
working the Taliban
cocktail party circuit, right?

13:54.156 --> 13:55.389
Exercises are just to see

13:55.457 --> 13:57.025
if you can stay cool
under pressure.

13:57.092 --> 13:59.527
You know, talk your way
out of a difficult situation.

13:59.595 --> 14:02.497
Knowing cold war spy craft
will not make you a great spy.

14:02.564 --> 14:04.065
Clearly not, Corey.

14:04.133 --> 14:05.833
You're, like, what?
Tenth on the list?

14:05.901 --> 14:07.468
Thanks.

14:07.536 --> 14:09.737
Well, not all of us
have Agency dads

14:09.805 --> 14:12.406
and two brothers
in special ops.

14:12.474 --> 14:14.709
Yeah, but, Shireen, you've got
something even better--

14:14.777 --> 14:16.444
level-five Farsi.

14:16.512 --> 14:18.112
The Agency would sell
a hundred of us techies

14:18.180 --> 14:19.280
for one of you.

14:19.348 --> 14:20.915
Meanwhile we're being judged

14:20.983 --> 14:22.850
on whether we took
a different route back to campus

14:22.918 --> 14:24.485
after weekend breaks.

14:24.553 --> 14:26.353
Even though we know
we weren't followed.

14:26.421 --> 14:30.190
You don't want to do detection
routes, Corey, then don't.

14:30.258 --> 14:32.026
But don't be surprised
if you find yourself

14:32.093 --> 14:34.194
in a dark cave
in the Khost-Gardez pass

14:34.262 --> 14:37.231
in Afghanistan,
getting beat with Kalashnikovs.

14:40.635 --> 14:42.936
Sweet dreams, campers.

14:46.074 --> 14:49.177
Well, I--I think
it's time for some Jack.

14:49.244 --> 14:51.613
What do you say?

14:51.680 --> 14:53.948
I need to get back
to my room.

15:02.959 --> 15:05.394
I think that I've found
what I've been looking for.

15:05.462 --> 15:08.030
It's compact
and easy to carry.

15:08.097 --> 15:09.497
Is it a fruit?

15:09.565 --> 15:11.766
Yep, but it's not
a Granny Smith.

15:16.738 --> 15:19.806
Am I clear to exit?

15:19.874 --> 15:21.174
You're on the list.

15:21.242 --> 15:23.843
Good.
Stay by the phone.

15:23.911 --> 15:26.746
Thank you.

15:36.925 --> 15:38.592
Name's not here.

15:38.660 --> 15:40.828
What?
Uh, no, that can't be.

15:40.896 --> 15:43.498
[Phone rings]
Security.

15:43.566 --> 15:48.370
What? Really?

15:48.437 --> 15:51.606
Yes, sir.

15:51.674 --> 15:55.342
Go on through.
Go.

15:55.410 --> 15:57.311
Thanks, Auggie.

15:57.379 --> 15:59.980
Well, considering the poor
health of your grandmother,

16:00.048 --> 16:04.184
it'd be cruel
not to let you leave campus.

16:04.252 --> 16:05.752
Be careful.
If what I'm told is true,

16:05.820 --> 16:08.222
your car isn't the most
inconspicuous color.

16:08.289 --> 16:11.425
I didn't know I was gonna be
tailing spies when I bought it.

16:11.493 --> 16:13.027
This trip might not
be worth it.

16:13.094 --> 16:15.929
This guy's got skills.

16:15.997 --> 16:17.531
[Horn honks]

16:17.599 --> 16:21.903
You're no slouch when
it comes to defensive driving.

16:21.971 --> 16:24.673
I definitely prefer
driving to guns.

16:24.741 --> 16:27.209
Here we go.

16:27.277 --> 16:28.845
[Horn honks]

16:28.912 --> 16:32.048
At least
you're being cautious.

16:32.116 --> 16:33.950
Go get 'em, Walker.

16:43.462 --> 16:46.998
[Horn honks,
indistinct chatter]

17:01.745 --> 17:03.946
[Horn honks]

17:22.558 --> 17:24.626
[Knocks]

17:24.694 --> 17:25.895
Emerson, it's me.

17:25.962 --> 17:27.229
I don't have
my key card.

17:27.297 --> 17:30.199
Emerson.
I'm sorry about being late.

17:30.266 --> 17:32.000
I'm trying to sleep.

17:32.068 --> 17:33.402
Well, if I have
to go to operations

17:33.469 --> 17:34.937
and report I'm locked out,

17:35.004 --> 17:37.005
I'll get a demerit
for breaking curfew.

17:37.072 --> 17:39.407
Too bad.

17:39.475 --> 17:41.976
I swear
it won't happen again.

17:42.044 --> 17:45.780
[Sighs]

17:45.847 --> 17:47.615
[Bird calls]

17:58.527 --> 18:01.162
Mornin'.

18:02.898 --> 18:04.432
This is an odd choice.

18:04.500 --> 18:06.434
Most runners prefer the roads
near the creek.

18:06.502 --> 18:10.072
Fewer cars here.

18:10.139 --> 18:11.807
You need firearms training,
right?

18:11.874 --> 18:15.009
Yeah, if I ever
intend to graduate.

18:15.077 --> 18:16.411
Got a few minutes.

18:16.478 --> 18:19.046
I'll give you a primer.
Climb in.

18:19.114 --> 18:21.048
Come on. Get in.

18:24.318 --> 18:26.319
[Engine starts]

18:34.595 --> 18:36.930
You got a demerit last night.

18:36.998 --> 18:39.333
Yeah, I got into it
with my roommate,

18:39.400 --> 18:41.368
found myself locked out.

18:41.436 --> 18:43.004
You let off some steam?

18:43.072 --> 18:45.374
Took a little break.

18:45.441 --> 18:48.778
I received permission to visit
my grandmother in Richmond.

18:48.845 --> 18:51.080
She's sick, so I did.

18:54.251 --> 18:56.919
That's a lie, actually.

18:56.987 --> 19:00.422
Last night I got in the car
and just drove.

19:00.490 --> 19:04.159
I thought it'd be less stressful
at the Farm second time around.

19:04.227 --> 19:08.063
It's not.

19:08.131 --> 19:09.998
Thought we were going
to the shooting range.

19:10.065 --> 19:12.800
Oh,
that won't be necessary.

19:15.370 --> 19:17.238
When you face a target,
real target,

19:17.305 --> 19:20.640
and your heartbeat
is ringing in your ears,

19:20.708 --> 19:25.845
your focus
is just completely clear.

19:25.913 --> 19:28.047
[Bird calls]

19:28.114 --> 19:31.417
It's afterwards
things become complicated.

19:31.485 --> 19:33.119
Your turn.

19:35.923 --> 19:37.924
Wait, wait, wait.
Bend.

19:37.992 --> 19:40.827
The Agency's all
about learning by doing.

19:40.895 --> 19:42.263
That's how
you become an elite.

19:42.331 --> 19:43.932
Of course,
if mistakes are made,

19:44.000 --> 19:47.236
they'll try to bury you.

19:47.303 --> 19:51.373
Ho! That's not bad
for somebody with no training.

19:51.441 --> 19:53.275
My dad
used to take me hunting.

19:53.343 --> 19:55.478
Little father-daughter
bonding moment?

19:55.546 --> 19:58.448
He thought so.
I wasn't into it.

19:58.515 --> 20:00.617
Well, you're into it now,
Oakley.

20:04.588 --> 20:05.722
That's it?

20:05.789 --> 20:08.692
For today.
Good job.

20:11.528 --> 20:13.128
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?

20:13.196 --> 20:14.630
Yeah. I was thinking
of skipping this one.

20:14.698 --> 20:15.964
The lecture
hasn't started yet?

20:16.032 --> 20:17.199
No, the D.S.T. officer

20:17.266 --> 20:18.500
that was scheduled
to be here is sick.

20:18.568 --> 20:20.068
[Insect buzzing]

20:20.136 --> 20:22.571
Replacement's probably
some lowly intern.

20:22.638 --> 20:27.041
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

20:27.109 --> 20:29.042
- Oh.
- This way, sir.

20:29.110 --> 20:30.944
I'm glad I didn't skip.

20:31.012 --> 20:32.713
Check it out.

20:32.780 --> 20:34.915
I know you were expecting
the foremost expert

20:34.983 --> 20:38.819
in audio surveillance
technology.

20:38.887 --> 20:41.221
Eh, you got me instead.

20:41.289 --> 20:43.091
The blind guy.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.827
Word of warning,
the room is bugged.

20:45.895 --> 20:48.096
Literally.

20:48.163 --> 20:51.499
Welcome to the future of
remote-controlled surveillance.

20:51.567 --> 20:54.502
Oh, and to my friend
in the back,

20:54.570 --> 20:58.340
I'm not an intern.

20:58.408 --> 21:01.344
Need some one-on-one time
to get through the content.

21:01.412 --> 21:05.315
Really?

21:05.383 --> 21:06.950
Somebody's
hot for teacher.

21:07.018 --> 21:10.353
Oh, audio surveillance tactics
is scintillating stuff.

21:10.421 --> 21:11.354
Oh.

21:11.422 --> 21:13.090
We alone?

21:13.157 --> 21:14.691
Yeah.

21:14.759 --> 21:16.425
I've got a bit
of technological wizardry

21:16.493 --> 21:17.960
for you too.

21:18.028 --> 21:19.395
I knew this
wasn't a social call.

21:19.463 --> 21:21.230
Our mole isn't a PC guy,

21:21.297 --> 21:22.564
so we had to scramble a bit,

21:22.632 --> 21:24.199
but she should
download four gigabytes

21:24.267 --> 21:25.433
in less than a minute.

21:25.501 --> 21:27.702
I only saw his laptop once.

21:27.770 --> 21:30.338
The cocktail party
exercise is tonight.

21:30.406 --> 21:32.140
While Roy
and the other instructors

21:32.208 --> 21:34.476
are grilling the trainees
on their covers,

21:34.544 --> 21:36.645
we'll peek into his office.
We?

21:36.713 --> 21:38.848
I'll talk you through it.

21:41.118 --> 21:44.054
I think Roy
might be on to me.

21:44.122 --> 21:46.090
He made you?
Last night?

21:46.157 --> 21:49.160
No. Maybe.
I don't know.

21:49.227 --> 21:51.828
