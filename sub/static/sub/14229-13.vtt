SKYLAR: Flight of the Jaquins.

01:08.830 --> 01:11.920
SKYLAR: Whoo-hoo!
Whoo-hoo!

01:11.920 --> 01:13.880
Skylar, would you
cut it out?

01:13.880 --> 01:15.330
We're already late.

01:15.330 --> 01:16.710
It's never too late

01:16.710 --> 01:18.290
to have a good time, Migs.

01:18.290 --> 01:19.710
Whoa! Look out!

01:19.710 --> 01:21.880
For what? Ahhh!

01:21.880 --> 01:24.460
SKYLAR: Ahhh! Whoa!

01:27.920 --> 01:30.420
Thanks, Migs.
That was a close one.

01:30.420 --> 01:32.460
Hey, let's do it again!

01:32.460 --> 01:33.710
You know, one of these days,

01:33.710 --> 01:35.830
you're gonna
have to grow up, Skylar.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.710
Not everything
is fun and games.

01:37.710 --> 01:39.880
Not when you're around,
that's for sure.

01:39.880 --> 01:41.250
C'mon, you two.

01:41.250 --> 01:43.250
We can't keep
Princess Elena waiting.

01:43.250 --> 01:46.880
Waiting for you, maybe!

01:46.880 --> 01:49.710
Next time,
I'm letting him hit the cliff.

01:54.830 --> 01:57.080
Your escorts have arrived!

01:57.080 --> 01:58.290
Sorry we're late.

01:58.290 --> 01:59.920
Ahem. Skylar's fault.
Ahem.

01:59.920 --> 02:01.580
That's OK.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.210
I just hope
we don't miss
the ceremony.

02:03.210 --> 02:04.670
Don't worry, Princessa.

02:04.670 --> 02:06.500
Since the Elders
agreed to let you come,

02:06.500 --> 02:08.330
they won't start
without you.

02:11.290 --> 02:13.830
So this ceremony
is a big deal, huh?

02:13.830 --> 02:15.460
The biggest.

02:15.460 --> 02:16.920
Today, they choose
this year's Navegera.

02:16.920 --> 02:17.960
I hope I get picked.

02:17.960 --> 02:19.080
Me, too!

02:19.080 --> 02:20.290
MIGS: You?
Skylar?

02:22.790 --> 02:23.830
What's so funny?

02:23.830 --> 02:25.830
Ah! It's the Navegera's job

02:25.830 --> 02:27.960
to oversee
the young Jaquins' training

02:27.960 --> 02:30.790
so they can become
the future protectors
of Avalor.

02:30.790 --> 02:33.120
And Skylar can barely
oversee himself.

02:33.120 --> 02:34.830
LUNA: You said that right.
SKYLAR: Hey!

02:34.830 --> 02:36.750
I would be
a great Navegera.

02:36.750 --> 02:38.710
LUNA:
MIGS:  Sure. Right.

02:40.330 --> 02:41.880
SKYLAR: Check it out, Elena.

02:41.880 --> 02:44.710
This is where
the Jaquins of Avalor City live!

02:44.710 --> 02:46.460
We're here, Chief.

02:46.460 --> 02:48.830
Well, better late than never.

02:48.830 --> 02:50.830
That's what I always say!

02:52.120 --> 02:54.290
Princess Elena.

02:54.290 --> 02:55.710
Chief Zephyr.

02:55.710 --> 02:57.080
It's so good
to see you again.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.710
We are honored
that you wanted to come.

02:59.710 --> 03:02.920
Since it is
both our duties
to protect Avalor,

03:02.920 --> 03:05.620
I thought we should
get to know
each other's ways.

03:05.620 --> 03:08.120
Well, then,
let us begin.

03:08.120 --> 03:09.830
ZEPHYR:
As guardians of Avalor,

03:09.830 --> 03:13.380
we have a long history
of defending the kingdom

03:13.380 --> 03:16.040
from the darker forces
of enchantment.

03:16.040 --> 03:18.380
We repelled menacing
sea creatures

03:18.380 --> 03:20.120
from our shores,

03:20.120 --> 03:23.750
and drove the trickster,
Troyo, from our jungles.

03:23.750 --> 03:27.580
But we couldn't stop
that evil sorceress, Shuriki,

03:27.580 --> 03:29.830
from taking over.

03:29.830 --> 03:33.920
And so every year,
three young Jaquins

03:33.920 --> 03:36.250
come from our home realm
of Vallestrela,

03:36.250 --> 03:39.290
to train to be
Guardians of Avalor.

03:39.290 --> 03:42.080
And now,
as is tradition,

03:42.080 --> 03:45.040
we shall hold a lottery
to choose the Navegera

03:45.040 --> 03:46.710
who will guide them.

03:46.710 --> 03:48.250
Here's my lucky feather.

03:48.250 --> 03:50.670
Oh! I have
such a good feeling
about this.

03:50.670 --> 03:52.830
I already prepared
a speech.

03:52.830 --> 03:55.500
C'mon, baby.
C'mon!

03:55.500 --> 03:56.540
Mwah.

04:00.290 --> 04:01.710
Why didn't you
put in a feather?

04:01.710 --> 04:04.710
You can only be
Navegera once.

04:04.710 --> 04:07.000
Migs was the best
Navegera ever.

04:07.000 --> 04:09.210
All his trainees
passed their tests.

04:09.210 --> 04:15.040
And our next Navegera
will be...

04:15.040 --> 04:18.080
Ah! Pick me, pick me,
pick me, pick me,
me, me, pick me.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.880
Skylar?

04:19.880 --> 04:21.120
ALL: Skylar!

04:21.120 --> 04:23.460
Yes! Whoo-hoo!

04:23.460 --> 04:24.960
Mwah, mwah,
mwah, mwah.

04:24.960 --> 04:26.880
No way! Not Skylar.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.710
I call for a re-draw!

04:28.710 --> 04:30.880
Yes! Yes!
I second that!

04:30.880 --> 04:31.880
Re-draw!

04:31.880 --> 04:33.500
Aw, come on, guys!

04:33.500 --> 04:34.880
What's going on?

04:34.880 --> 04:36.750
The Chief can choose
a new Navegera

04:36.750 --> 04:39.250
if the clan
doesn't approve
of the choice.

04:39.250 --> 04:40.540
Oh!

04:40.540 --> 04:43.830
All those in favor
of a re

04:44.880 --> 04:47.620
What? No!

04:47.620 --> 04:48.920
You too, Migs?

04:48.920 --> 04:51.830
You're just not ready
for the responsibility.

04:51.830 --> 04:53.040
SKYLAR: Luna?

04:53.040 --> 04:54.330
Sorry, Skylar.

04:54.330 --> 04:55.710
SKYLAR:
ELENA: Uh,

04:55.710 --> 04:57.210
Chief Zephyr,

04:57.210 --> 04:59.790
may I say a few words
on behalf of Skylar?

04:59.790 --> 05:01.920
Of course.

05:01.920 --> 05:05.380
We all know that Skylar
can be a bit reckless, ha,

05:05.380 --> 05:07.540
heedless, careless.

05:07.540 --> 05:09.540
Just about anything
with the word "less."

05:09.540 --> 05:10.790
Uh-huh.

05:10.790 --> 05:12.210
Please tell me
you are going somewhere

05:12.210 --> 05:13.750
with this, Princessa.

05:13.750 --> 05:17.540
But let me remind everyone
about another side.

05:17.540 --> 05:20.380
The Skylar who helped
overthrow Shuriki,

05:20.380 --> 05:22.540
and save a village
from lava.

05:22.540 --> 05:25.080
Skylar is loyal, brave,

05:25.080 --> 05:26.460
and when it counts,

05:26.460 --> 05:29.120
he shows up
and gets the job done.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.250
I know this isn't
my decision,

05:31.250 --> 05:34.500
but I believe
he'll make
a great Navegera.

05:36.830 --> 05:38.920
The drawing will stand.

05:38.920 --> 05:41.750
You are the Navegera.

05:42.750 --> 05:44.380
Yes! I mean...

05:44.380 --> 05:48.040
I humbly accept the honor,
oh wise Elder.

05:48.040 --> 05:49.920
Now, as is the custom,

05:49.920 --> 05:51.460
your first task

05:51.460 --> 05:53.710
is to pick up
your Jaquin trainees

05:53.710 --> 05:57.290
at the gateway
to Vallestrella.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.540
As in, right now.

06:01.540 --> 06:03.210
Oh! You got it.

06:03.210 --> 06:04.750
For Vallestrella!

06:04.750 --> 06:06.420
ALL: For Avalor!

06:07.830 --> 06:08.920
MIGS: You got the flight plan.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.880
So fly straight there
and back.

06:10.880 --> 06:12.380
No detours.

06:12.380 --> 06:14.500
I know how easily
you can get distracted.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.830
Oh, sorry,
did you say something?

06:16.830 --> 06:18.710
Just kidding!

06:18.710 --> 06:20.540
This is serious, Skylar.

06:20.540 --> 06:22.420
You have young Jaquins
under your care,

06:22.420 --> 06:24.540
who have never
been to Avalor before.

06:24.540 --> 06:26.460
And you won't have Migs
to bail you out

06:26.460 --> 06:27.790
if you get in trouble.

06:27.790 --> 06:29.120
Don't worry.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.960
I'm just gonna do
what Migs would do.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.330
Be responsible?

06:32.330 --> 06:33.710
I was gonna say
"be boring,"

06:33.710 --> 06:34.750
but sure, that too.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.250
You better get going.

06:36.250 --> 06:38.290
The young Jaquins
will be at the gateway soon.

06:38.290 --> 06:39.790
Good luck, Skylar.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.790
Thanks for standing up
for me, Princessa.

06:41.790 --> 06:44.250
I won't let you down.

06:49.330 --> 06:52.380
That was a nice thing
you did for him
back there, Princess.

06:52.380 --> 06:55.170
Let's hope he doesn't
make you regret it.

07:25.880 --> 07:27.290
Hey there!

07:27.290 --> 07:29.710
Whoa! You look a little old
to be a trainee.

07:30.710 --> 07:33.750
Young Jaquins!
Come forward!

07:36.880 --> 07:38.790
Hi, I'm Ciela.

07:38.790 --> 07:40.710
I'm ready to learn
and follow every rule

07:40.710 --> 07:42.500
so I can be the best
guardian possible!

07:42.500 --> 07:43.580
Ho-ho!

07:43.580 --> 07:45.460
Migs is gonna love you.

07:48.580 --> 07:50.380
Was I supposed to
come out now, or...

07:50.380 --> 07:51.540
Or, or wait?

07:51.540 --> 07:53.540
'Cause I-I can go back.

07:53.540 --> 07:54.750
That's Avión.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.670
Hi, Avión.
I'm Skylar.

07:56.670 --> 07:58.120
Skylar? Wait.

07:58.120 --> 08:00.750
The King of Vallestrella
has a son named Skylar.

08:00.750 --> 08:02.540
I know.
That's me!

08:02.540 --> 08:04.380
NICO: Comin' through!

08:05.920 --> 08:07.540
BOTH:

08:07.540 --> 08:09.330
Argh.

08:09.330 --> 08:10.830
Whoa! Nico?

08:10.830 --> 08:11.750
Big bro?

08:11.750 --> 08:13.540
So Dad made you sign up

08:13.540 --> 08:14.830
for Guardian Training too?

08:14.830 --> 08:16.330
You know it!

08:16.330 --> 08:18.380
BOTH: Whoa!

08:18.380 --> 08:19.790
BOTH: Reverse. Ah!

08:19.790 --> 08:22.790
I missed you.
Me, too.

08:22.790 --> 08:23.750
Ah-ahem.

08:23.750 --> 08:24.790
Oh, right.

08:24.790 --> 08:26.120
I have to get
you Jaquins home.

08:26.120 --> 08:27.210
Hmm.

08:31.380 --> 08:32.880
You're the Navegera?

08:32.880 --> 08:34.500
I sure am.

08:34.500 --> 08:36.170
Wings up, amigos!

08:40.670 --> 08:43.580
We're so lucky to have
Skylar as our Navegera.

08:43.580 --> 08:45.880
He really knows
how to have fun!

08:45.880 --> 08:47.920
Since when
is the Navegera

08:47.920 --> 08:49.670
supposed to teach us
to have fun?

08:50.880 --> 08:52.170
Hey, remember
all the pranks

08:52.170 --> 08:53.290
we used to pull?

08:53.290 --> 08:54.380
How could I forget?

08:54.380 --> 08:55.920
They were legendary.

08:55.920 --> 08:58.500
One time,
we took apart
our nest at home

08:58.500 --> 09:00.330
and rebuilt it
upside

09:00.330 --> 09:01.960
while Dad was sleeping in it.

09:01.960 --> 09:04.540
That's impossible.
He'd fall right out.

09:04.540 --> 09:06.790
Not if you tied him
to the nest with vines!

09:06.790 --> 09:07.830
BOTH:

09:07.830 --> 09:09.170
SKYLAR: That's right.

09:09.170 --> 09:11.000
BOTH:

09:11.000 --> 09:13.170
Hey, now that
we're together again,

09:13.170 --> 09:15.120
we are gonna have
the best time,

09:15.120 --> 09:16.210
just like we used to.

09:16.210 --> 09:18.120
Get ready, Avalor.

10:21.460 --> 10:23.250
That's where the Noblins live.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.710
They're magical shape shifters

10:24.710 --> 10:26.290
that can turn things
into gold.

10:26.290 --> 10:29.830
No way!
This I gotta see!

10:29.830 --> 10:32.250
Sorry, Nico.
No detours.

10:32.250 --> 10:33.830
The elders are expecting us.

10:33.830 --> 10:35.670
And we can't be late.

10:35.670 --> 10:37.460
Right. We can't.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.500
Can we?

10:38.500 --> 10:39.750
Oh, come on.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.420
It'll be quick.
I promise!

10:41.420 --> 10:44.500
It'll be just like
old times. Please.

10:44.500 --> 10:47.170
OK. One quick stop.

10:47.170 --> 10:49.290
Don't worry.
We won't be late.

10:49.290 --> 10:50.830
What did I tell you?

10:50.830 --> 10:54.670
My big bro
is the best! Ha-ha.

JIKU: Skylar!

11:34.710 --> 11:36.620
What brings you out here?

11:36.620 --> 11:38.920
Ah! We're just
passing through, Jiku.

11:38.920 --> 11:40.790
Well, you came
at the perfect time!

11:40.790 --> 11:43.880
We're just about to start
a game of golden sun disk.

11:43.880 --> 11:45.290
Think fast!

11:45.290 --> 11:48.120
I love it.
Let's play.

11:48.120 --> 11:51.000
OK, but just one game.

11:51.000 --> 11:52.040
Come on, you two.

11:53.790 --> 11:56.210
My mother said
we'd go straight
to Avalor City.

11:56.210 --> 11:57.830
Mine, too.

11:57.830 --> 12:01.170
But she also said
to listen to my Navegera.

12:06.580 --> 12:09.380
Oh, they should've
been back hours ago.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.170
Do you think
something happened
to them?

12:11.170 --> 12:13.250
Yeah.
Skylar happened.

12:13.250 --> 12:15.960
He's probably got them
goofing off somewhere.

12:15.960 --> 12:18.170
He said
he wouldn't do that.

12:18.170 --> 12:20.040
But it is getting late.

12:20.040 --> 12:21.670
We should go
looking for them.

12:21.670 --> 12:24.830
All right.
Hop on, princess.

12:29.330 --> 12:31.250
Over here!
I'm open!

12:31.250 --> 12:32.750
SKYLAR:  Ha-ha!

12:32.750 --> 12:34.710
Dog pile!

12:36.830 --> 12:39.290
Oh!

12:40.620 --> 12:41.920
Ha!

12:41.920 --> 12:43.790
Take it all the way,
baby bro!

12:44.830 --> 12:46.880
Score!
Whoo-hoo!

12:50.880 --> 12:52.620
Now, can we go?

12:52.620 --> 12:55.000
Aw! One more game.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.460
You said that
three games ago.

12:57.460 --> 12:59.040
We're already late as it is.

12:59.040 --> 13:00.500
Ciela's right, Nico.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.210
JIKU: Get ready.
CIELA: Huh?

13:03.830 --> 13:05.920
We're just about to start
the sapodilla hunt.

13:05.920 --> 13:08.040
It's fun. Ha-ha.
And tasty.

13:08.040 --> 13:10.170
Whoa!

13:10.170 --> 13:13.040
It's like playing a game
and having a snack
at the same time!

13:13.040 --> 13:14.830
You Noblins are geniuses.

13:14.830 --> 13:16.790
Ha! Thank you, Jiku,

13:16.790 --> 13:18.080
but we really
have to get going.

13:18.080 --> 13:19.080
NOBLINS: Aw.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.170
What happened to you?

13:20.170 --> 13:22.040
You used to be fun, Skylar.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.120
I guess the bros
aren't back.

13:25.960 --> 13:29.250
No. The bros are back,
and I'm still fun.

13:29.250 --> 13:31.250
Maybe one hunt.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.920
Then we leave.
No complaining.

13:34.210 --> 13:35.710
You got it!

13:38.210 --> 13:40.250
Avión, we're really late.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.920
What if the Elders get mad?

13:41.920 --> 13:44.420
I don't wanna fail
Guardian Training
on the first day.

13:44.420 --> 13:45.710
Me neither.

13:45.710 --> 13:46.790
Uh, should we tell
our Navegera?

13:46.790 --> 13:48.620
We already did!

13:48.620 --> 13:50.620
We'll just have to fly to
Avalor City ourselves.

13:50.620 --> 13:53.290
But I don't know
how to get there.
Do you?

13:53.290 --> 13:54.750
No.
TROYO: Psst.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.710
Hey. I know the way.

13:57.710 --> 13:59.880
Who said that?
TROYO: Me.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.460
Hi. The name's Troyo.

14:02.460 --> 14:05.500
At your service.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.710
Hey,
I know a shortcut
to Avalor City.

14:07.710 --> 14:09.040
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.880
A hidden mountain pass

14:10.880 --> 14:13.120
that would get you there
lickety-split.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.710
C'mon.
I'll show ya.

14:14.710 --> 14:17.460
Thank you!
You're a lifesaver!

14:17.460 --> 14:20.830
Aw, please. Ha-ha.
Right this way.

14:31.960 --> 14:34.040
How soon will we get
to Avalor City?

14:34.040 --> 14:37.500
Hmm. Let me
calculate this.

14:39.000 --> 14:40.000
Never!

14:40.000 --> 14:42.080
BOTH:

14:42.080 --> 14:45.750
BOTH: Whoa!

14:50.830 --> 14:52.040
We're almost at the gateway

14:52.040 --> 14:53.540
and we still haven't
seen them.

14:53.540 --> 14:55.670
Which means
they must have landed.

14:55.670 --> 14:57.290
But they could be anywhere.

14:57.290 --> 14:59.880
Hey,
that's Pueblo De Oro
down there.

14:59.880 --> 15:02.620
Maybe one of the Noblins
saw where they went.

15:02.620 --> 15:05.120
I thought you were
going to help us.

15:05.120 --> 15:07.080
D-D-D-D-Don't worry.

15:07.080 --> 15:08.880
I don't want
anything with you.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.080
Then, why are we here?

15:11.080 --> 15:15.330
Because the Jaquin Elders
kicked me out of Avalor.

15:15.330 --> 15:19.250
Yeah! I guess they didn't
like the way I tried to
rule the jungle.

15:19.250 --> 15:20.880
But those goody goody Jaquins

15:20.880 --> 15:23.120
are in for an
unpleasant surprise.

15:23.120 --> 15:25.040
Troyo is back,

15:25.040 --> 15:27.040
and I'm not letting you go

15:27.040 --> 15:29.710
until they agree to stay
out of my way

15:29.710 --> 15:32.080
and make me
king of the jungle.

15:32.080 --> 15:33.460
So relax.

15:33.460 --> 15:34.750
Make yourself comfortable.

15:34.750 --> 15:36.380
Here, have a mango.

15:39.790 --> 15:42.380
Argh! Why can't I find any?

15:43.330 --> 15:44.710
There!

15:44.710 --> 15:47.710
NICO: Ha-ha!
Too slow, big bro.

15:54.290 --> 15:56.080
SKYLAR: Ha!

15:56.080 --> 15:57.710
Now who's too slow?

15:57.710 --> 15:59.420
Skylar!
Huh?

16:01.830 --> 16:04.000
Hey, Princessa.
What are you doing here?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.120
What are you doing here?

16:06.120 --> 16:07.710
You were supposed to be
back by now!

16:07.710 --> 16:09.380
Oh, uh, we just stopped by

16:09.380 --> 16:11.420
to say hi to the Noblins
and, uh...

16:11.420 --> 16:14.170
And play their
super-fun games!

16:14.170 --> 16:15.290
Nico's here?

16:15.290 --> 16:16.750
Well, that explains it.

16:16.750 --> 16:18.540
When Skylar and his brother
are together,

16:18.540 --> 16:20.920
it's playtime,
all the time.

16:20.920 --> 16:21.830
But we were about to leave.

16:21.830 --> 16:23.120
Right now!

16:23.120 --> 16:26.250
Uh, come on, guys.
Avión! Ciela!

16:26.250 --> 16:29.460
I'm sure they're
around here somewhere.

16:29.460 --> 16:30.920
BOTH: Mm-hmm.

16:30.920 --> 16:32.710
JIKU: Princess Elena!

16:34.330 --> 16:35.330
Hi, Jiku.

16:35.330 --> 16:37.040
You don't happen to know

16:37.040 --> 16:39.920
where the other
two little Jaquins went,
do you?

16:39.920 --> 16:43.750
Um, last time I saw them
was over by those trees.

16:46.290 --> 16:48.460
Wait. Are those
Jaquin paw prints?

16:48.460 --> 16:49.920
They sure are.

16:54.750 --> 16:57.500
Uh-oh. Skylar!
Get over here!
Right now!

16:59.790 --> 17:01.830
What is it?

17:01.830 --> 17:03.580
LUNA: That's Troyo's mark.

17:03.580 --> 17:05.290
Troyo?

17:05.290 --> 17:08.000
Uh, didn't Chief Zephyr
say something about a Troyo?

17:08.000 --> 17:10.380
Uh-huh.
He was a magical coyote

17:10.380 --> 17:13.580
who used to go around
trickin' people into doing
bad things for him,

17:13.580 --> 17:15.710
so he could become
the king of the jungle.

17:15.710 --> 17:18.120
We kicked him
out of Avalor years ago.

17:18.120 --> 17:19.750
He must've snuck back in.

17:19.750 --> 17:21.830
From the look
of those paw prints,

17:21.830 --> 17:23.750
Ciela and Avión
went off with him.

17:23.750 --> 17:26.750
Troyo has those
poor little Jaquins!

17:26.750 --> 17:29.880
You had one job.
But typical Skylar.

17:29.880 --> 17:32.170
You start fooling around,
and now look what happened.

17:32.170 --> 17:34.330
I'm sorry.
I didn't think--

17:34.330 --> 17:37.880
You never do.
That's the problem.

17:37.880 --> 17:40.250
OK. The paw prints
should lead us
right to them.

17:40.250 --> 17:41.540
Let's go, Luna.

17:41.540 --> 17:43.040
I--I'll come too.

17:43.040 --> 17:46.790
No, Skylar.
We'll take it from here.

17:46.790 --> 17:48.330
I stood up for you.

17:48.330 --> 17:50.790
I believed in you
when nobody else did.

17:50.790 --> 17:52.960
And you said you wouldn't
let me down, Skylar.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.710
I know, Princessa.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.080
Migs, Luna!
Wait up!

17:59.620 --> 18:01.210
I'm sorry, big bro.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.330
I shouldn't have asked
to come down here.

18:03.330 --> 18:04.710
It's not your fault, Nico.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.880
It's mine for not
sticking to the plan.

18:06.880 --> 18:09.000
I'm supposed to be
the Navegera.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.380
But I haven't been
taking it seriously enough.

18:11.380 --> 18:14.420
Migs was right.
It's time I grew up.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.170
Uh, where are you going?

18:16.170 --> 18:18.790
To save my trainees.

18:23.170 --> 18:26.210
MIGS: That's strange.
The paw prints just stop.

18:26.210 --> 18:27.500
How's that possible?

18:27.500 --> 18:29.750
Because the trail ends here.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.460
MIGS: Troyo!
ELENA:

18:31.460 --> 18:33.120
ALL:

18:33.120 --> 18:34.920
Oh, no!

18:34.920 --> 18:37.750
Any other Jaquins
out there

18:40.250 --> 18:41.750
Why didn't you
go after him?

18:41.750 --> 18:43.750
Because we wouldn't have
stood a chance.

18:43.750 --> 18:46.960
Troyo was tricky enough
to capture Elena,
Luna, and Migs.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.790
So what do we do?

18:48.790 --> 18:49.960
I don't know.

18:49.960 --> 18:51.670
I'm used to
Migs bailing me out.

18:51.670 --> 18:52.830
Not the other way around.

18:52.830 --> 18:53.920
Well...

18:53.920 --> 18:56.040
What would Migs do?

18:56.040 --> 18:58.380
That's what
I've got to do.

18:58.380 --> 18:59.960
I've gotta be like Migs.

18:59.960 --> 19:02.420
OK.

19:02.420 --> 19:04.710
I am Migs.
I am grumpy and boring,

19:04.710 --> 19:06.920
but smart and responsible.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.790
Oh, what do I do?

19:08.790 --> 19:10.500
I got it!

19:10.500 --> 19:12.620
The only way
to beat a trickster

19:12.620 --> 19:14.000
is to out-trick him.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.580
How?
By thinking like Migs,

19:16.580 --> 19:19.710
but acting like me.
Come on, Nico!

19:19.710 --> 19:22.210
And who are you, my dear?

19:22.210 --> 19:24.750
I'm the Crown Princess
of Avalor.

19:24.750 --> 19:26.750
I wouldn't mess with her
if I were you, Troyo.

19:26.750 --> 19:29.420
SKYLAR: They must be
around here somewhere.

19:29.420 --> 19:32.920
Elena Migs?

19:32.920 --> 19:35.580
Ooh, time to collect
more Jaquins!

19:35.580 --> 19:36.920
Be back in a flash.

19:39.880 --> 19:42.920
If it isn't the worst
Navegera ever.

19:42.920 --> 19:44.710
Let my friends go, Troyo.

19:44.710 --> 19:45.710
Or else...

19:45.710 --> 19:48.540
OK, Navegera.

19:48.540 --> 19:49.920
Just stay where you are

19:49.920 --> 19:52.250
and I'll take you
right to them.

19:54.670 --> 19:55.670
What?

19:58.040 --> 20:00.330
Oops.
You may be a trickster,

20:00.330 --> 20:04.330
but you are looking at
two of the best pranksters
in all of Avalor!

20:04.330 --> 20:06.670
We can spot a trap
a mile away.

20:06.670 --> 20:08.670
And make it our trap
in seconds.

20:08.670 --> 20:12.080
Sheesh! Your little prank
can't hold Troyo.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.670
You were saying?

20:24.830 --> 20:25.880
Yeah!

20:34.540 --> 20:36.750
This vine
can't hold me either.

20:36.750 --> 20:39.500
Oh, you're right.
Jiku!

20:41.750 --> 20:44.380
Try getting out of this!

20:47.420 --> 20:48.580
Oh!

20:49.670 --> 20:52.000
Ha-ha!
Nice work, big bro.

20:52.000 --> 20:53.880
You too, baby bro.

20:53.880 --> 20:56.620
Now, about our friends...

20:58.420 --> 21:00.790
I'm sorry.
We made a big mistake.

21:00.790 --> 21:02.830
We shouldn't have
gone off with someone
we didn't know.

21:02.830 --> 21:03.880
We won't do it again.

21:05.250 --> 21:07.710
You guys done
playing around
down here?

21:07.710 --> 21:09.500
Skylar!

21:11.380 --> 21:12.920
Take him away!

21:12.920 --> 21:14.920
And this time, make sure
he doesn't come back.

21:14.920 --> 21:17.880
OK, so king of the jungle
is out of the question.

21:17.880 --> 21:20.330
I'll settle for prince.
Duke

21:20.330 --> 21:21.670
Dogcatcher?

21:23.830 --> 21:24.880
I just don't get it.

21:24.880 --> 21:27.040
How did you defeat Troyo?

21:27.040 --> 21:29.830
I just thought to myself,
"What would Migs do?"

21:29.830 --> 21:30.830
Really?

21:30.830 --> 21:32.330
And you still did it?

21:32.330 --> 21:35.960
Yup. I may have thrown
a little Skylar in there too.

21:35.960 --> 21:39.040
There's hope
for you yet,
Navegera.

21:40.540 --> 21:42.500
I'm proud of you, Skylar.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.710
Well,
you said it yourself,
Princessa.

21:44.710 --> 21:45.830
When it counts,

21:45.830 --> 21:48.250
I show up
and get the job done.

21:48.250 --> 21:50.920
You certainly do.

21:50.920 --> 21:53.460
Let's go home.

21:53.460 --> 21:55.750
Wings up, amigos!

21:59.830 --> 22:01.920
SKYLAR: For Vallestrella!

22:01.920 --> 22:03.750
ALL: For Avalor!
