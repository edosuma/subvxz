00:18.417 --> 00:19.251
Howard!

00:23.890 --> 00:26.092
Just look at him.

00:26.091 --> 00:26.992
Poor thing.

00:30.263 --> 00:32.098
He has no idea

00:32.097 --> 00:35.267
just how much potential
he really has.

00:36.435 --> 00:39.172
Trust me, things aren't
all so bad for him.

00:41.707 --> 00:43.575
Well, maybe just a bit.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.347
Pack the gun, Howard.

00:47.347 --> 00:49.182
You will need it.

00:49.182 --> 00:52.852
I have to
pack my little friend.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.303
Sound speed.

01:10.302 --> 01:11.303
Camera speed.

01:11.304 --> 01:12.839
Production number one, take one.

01:12.838 --> 01:13.772
Hi.

01:13.772 --> 01:15.007
My name is Denise Snyder,

01:15.007 --> 01:17.309
and I'm auditioning
for the role of Flowy.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.812
It's Fleaowe.

01:18.811 --> 01:20.379
Oh, sorry.
- Yeah.

01:20.379 --> 01:21.613
Get it right.

01:21.614 --> 01:23.049
Okay, so I'll be
reading with you.

01:23.049 --> 01:23.917
I'm Howard.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.085
Hi.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.585
Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, enchanté. Okay.

01:26.585 --> 01:29.254
Interior captain's
quarters, day.

01:30.623 --> 01:33.626
"Fleaowe."
- "Commander, what is it?"

01:35.561 --> 01:37.830
Okay, go
back to your mark.

01:37.831 --> 01:38.965
I don't know what that was.

01:38.965 --> 01:40.233
Just go back to-
- Howard,

01:40.233 --> 01:41.301
just get back to
the lines, please.

01:41.301 --> 01:42.402
Howard-
- Well, it's her line.

01:42.402 --> 01:43.603
Okay.
- Sorry.

01:44.971 --> 01:48.575
"It's a bird, it's a
plane, it's a space kitty!"

01:48.575 --> 01:50.143
"A space kitty?"

01:50.143 --> 01:51.111
"Oh, no, wait."

01:51.111 --> 01:52.545
"It's just an asteroid."

01:52.545 --> 01:53.513
"No, computer."

01:53.513 --> 01:55.048
"How do you frost a cake?"

01:55.048 --> 01:56.282
"Commander, I
know how to frost a cake."

01:56.281 --> 01:57.950
"Voice print confirmed."

01:57.950 --> 01:59.985
"Stop showing off, Fleaowe."

01:59.986 --> 02:01.988
"In the future,
which we're in now,

02:01.987 --> 02:04.123
computers are
superior to women."

02:05.058 --> 02:06.526
"I'm sorry, Commander."

02:06.525 --> 02:09.061
"But remember, I was in the
deep freeze for over 100 years."

02:09.062 --> 02:09.996
See?

02:09.996 --> 02:11.131
She gets it, she gets this line.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.866
Let's continue.
- Okay.

02:12.866 --> 02:14.100
"Well, damn!"

02:14.099 --> 02:16.301
"Well, Fleaowe, I
will not fail you."

02:16.301 --> 02:17.503
"I forgive you this time."

02:17.503 --> 02:19.071
"So what's your objective?"

02:19.072 --> 02:21.274
"My objective?"

02:21.274 --> 02:23.576
Right, "It's to rescue
all the baby space cats,

02:23.575 --> 02:25.711
and bring them home
to Scratching Post 4".

02:25.711 --> 02:28.380
"You mean, in 5?"

02:28.381 --> 02:29.315
"Right."

02:29.314 --> 02:30.115
All right, good.

02:30.116 --> 02:30.884
Okay, yeah, great.

02:30.883 --> 02:31.884
Excellent.

02:31.884 --> 02:33.051
And?
- "I'm here to serve

02:33.051 --> 02:34.119
all of my Commander's needs."
- Okay,

02:34.120 --> 02:35.922
can you do that sexier?

02:35.921 --> 02:36.922
Oh?
- Look,

02:36.923 --> 02:38.124
"I'm here to serve all".
- Sure.

02:38.123 --> 02:39.458
Yeah, and sort of sexier.
- Okay.

02:39.459 --> 02:40.927
All right.

02:40.926 --> 02:43.529
"I'm here to serve all of my
Commander's needs this mission,

02:43.530 --> 02:45.598
and physical, if necessary."

02:48.268 --> 02:49.269
How was that?

02:49.269 --> 02:50.103
It was good.

02:50.103 --> 02:51.838
I liked the sexy part.

02:51.837 --> 02:53.472
The sexy part was good.

02:53.473 --> 02:55.909
You're feeling the chemistry?

02:55.908 --> 02:58.277
But it's like there's some
chemistry in here, right?

02:58.277 --> 02:59.311
You and I?

02:59.312 --> 03:00.647
Denise, you did

03:00.646 --> 03:01.914
a beautiful job,
- I don't know what to say.

03:01.914 --> 03:02.881
Howard, you
can't just tell someone

03:02.882 --> 03:04.284
you like the sexy part.

03:04.283 --> 03:06.118
But yes, Denise did a good job.

03:06.118 --> 03:07.586
Yes.

03:07.586 --> 03:10.189
Howard, did you
wanna see her do anything else?

03:10.189 --> 03:12.491
Anything but in a sexy tone?

03:13.626 --> 03:14.861
All
besides the sexy time?

03:14.860 --> 03:17.229
Yeah, the
sexy tone, not time.

03:17.229 --> 03:19.498
Oh, okay.
- I'm so sorry, Denise.

03:19.498 --> 03:20.866
Denise, if you wanna
try something else,

03:20.866 --> 03:22.768
we can definitely do that.

03:22.769 --> 03:25.004
Let's see.

03:25.003 --> 03:26.238
You've got-
- I think I'm good.

03:26.239 --> 03:27.307
I think I'm gonna-
- Can we see the

03:27.306 --> 03:29.408
space walk again?

03:29.408 --> 03:30.776
Denise,
if you wanna show us

03:30.776 --> 03:32.611
the space walk
again, that's fine.

03:32.611 --> 03:34.346
Howard, I think maybe
you and I need to talk.

03:34.347 --> 03:35.281
No, I wanna-
- Denise, we need

03:35.281 --> 03:36.115
to go, actually.

03:36.115 --> 03:37.383
It's okay.

03:37.383 --> 03:38.518
I actually need to go.
- Let's just get goin'.

03:38.518 --> 03:39.652
Okay, she needs-
- Yeah, so

03:39.651 --> 03:40.452
bye.
- Yeah, but let's just get-

03:40.453 --> 03:41.621
Howard,

03:41.621 --> 03:42.722
for the love of God!
- I wanna see

03:42.722 --> 03:43.523
the space walk again.
- Thank you.

03:43.522 --> 03:44.790
It was nice meeting you.

03:44.790 --> 03:45.991
It was nice
meeting you too, Denise.

03:45.991 --> 03:46.858
I just wanna see-
- I am so sorry.

03:46.859 --> 03:47.894
Yeah.
- Can you just-

03:47.894 --> 03:49.095
can you space walk out?
- Howard,

03:49.094 --> 03:50.028
get behind the camera.
- Space walk out,

03:50.028 --> 03:50.829
okay?
- Howard.

03:50.830 --> 03:51.764
Jesus Christ, Howard!

03:51.764 --> 03:52.432
What the fuck is your problem.

03:53.233 --> 03:53.800
Don't go after her.

03:53.800 --> 03:54.901
Do not!

03:54.901 --> 03:55.868
No! You stay there.
- So we-

03:55.867 --> 03:57.135
We have her information, right?

03:57.135 --> 03:58.136
Do
not go after her.

03:58.137 --> 03:59.405
Howard!

03:59.405 --> 04:00.540
Howard! For the love of
god, can we cut guys?

04:00.539 --> 04:01.740
Can we just cut?

04:01.741 --> 04:02.508
Because now he's going
after our talent.

04:02.508 --> 04:03.710
Great!

a real Italian sauce?

12:56.642 --> 12:57.610
What?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.078
Okay, I found this out.

12:59.077 --> 13:00.545
You take a whole onion,

13:00.546 --> 13:03.849
and you grate it with the
cheese grater over the sauce,

13:03.849 --> 13:06.118
and it makes it spicy.

13:06.118 --> 13:07.086
Oh, really?

Uh-huh.

13:08.019 --> 13:09.621
Well, try this, and tell me

13:09.621 --> 13:12.290
if you feel like it needs onion.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.294
It's perfect.

13:15.293 --> 13:16.995
Thank you.

13:16.995 --> 13:18.563

- Okay.

13:19.831 --> 13:23.535

13:34.046 --> 13:37.383
We'll finish this,
and then we will fuck.

13:37.383 --> 13:38.517
Okay.

13:40.485 --> 13:41.319
Bye, babe.

13:43.288 --> 13:44.122
Howie?

13:49.961 --> 13:52.931
Hi, my name is Nikki, and
I'm reading for Fleaowe.

13:52.932 --> 13:54.366
And I'll
be reading with you.

13:54.365 --> 13:55.333
Oh?
- Okay.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.369
Ahoy.
- Ahoy.

13:59.038 --> 14:01.774
Interior captain's
quarters, day.

14:01.774 --> 14:03.042
"Fleaowe?"

14:03.042 --> 14:04.510
"Commander, what is it?"

14:04.509 --> 14:05.910
"Oh, no!"

14:05.910 --> 14:08.680
"It's a bird, it's a
plane, it's a space kitty?"

14:08.681 --> 14:09.815
"A space kitty?"
- Oh.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.317
"Oh, wait, no!"

14:11.317 --> 14:14.320
"It's just an asteroid."

14:14.320 --> 14:16.989
"No, Computer, how
do you frost a cake?"

14:16.989 --> 14:18.390
That's my computer voice.

14:18.389 --> 14:19.791
Oh, okay.
- Okay.

14:19.792 --> 14:20.526
Commander, I know how to-

14:20.525 --> 14:21.259
Okay.
- Yep.

14:21.259 --> 14:22.093
Go ahead.

14:22.094 --> 14:23.329
Do your line, go ahead.

14:23.328 --> 14:25.163
"Commander, I know
how to frost a cake."

14:25.163 --> 14:26.598
"I forgive you this time."

14:26.599 --> 14:28.667
"So what's your objective?"

14:28.667 --> 14:30.469
"My objective?"

14:30.469 --> 14:32.972
"It's to rescue all
the space kittens,

14:32.971 --> 14:35.640
and take 'em home to
Scratching Post 4."

14:35.640 --> 14:36.975
"Yeah,
you mean five."

14:36.975 --> 14:37.942
Five, right?

14:37.942 --> 14:38.643
Five.

14:38.644 --> 14:39.478
Okay.

14:39.477 --> 14:40.311
Okay, good.

14:40.312 --> 14:41.146
Excellent.

14:41.145 --> 14:42.347
And?

14:42.347 --> 14:43.748
"And I'm here to serve

14:43.749 --> 14:46.518
all of my Commander's
needs this mission,

14:46.518 --> 14:48.187
physical, if necessary."

14:48.187 --> 14:49.021
"Right."

14:49.020 --> 14:50.221
"Remember, Fleaowe,

14:50.221 --> 14:52.323
we'll have plenty of
down time on this ship."

14:52.323 --> 14:55.293
"We'll make sure you get a big
promotion after the rescue."

14:55.293 --> 14:56.527
"Commander?"

14:56.528 --> 14:58.097
"Alpha Screen."

14:58.096 --> 14:59.631
"We have a cataract."

14:59.631 --> 15:00.565
"What's that?"

15:00.566 --> 15:02.001
"It's a type of cat attack."

15:02.000 --> 15:03.334
"Battle stations!"

15:03.335 --> 15:04.737
"Commander, I don't
have my space suit."

15:04.736 --> 15:06.871
It's in my chamber
on deck Level 4."

15:06.871 --> 15:07.805
"There's no time!"

15:07.806 --> 15:09.408
"Computer, generate space suit."

15:09.408 --> 15:10.643
Nikki, right?

15:10.643 --> 15:11.677
Yeah.
- Okay.

15:11.677 --> 15:12.511
Yeah.
- Give me more space.

15:12.510 --> 15:13.678
Let's do it, okay?

15:13.678 --> 15:15.880
Like do one like
where you're in space.

15:15.880 --> 15:16.781
Oh, okay?

15:19.618 --> 15:21.220
What would make it
feel more like space?

15:21.220 --> 15:22.388
I feel like you just...

15:22.388 --> 15:23.622
It was like Earth.

15:23.621 --> 15:25.490
You were just standing
there like it was Earth.

15:25.490 --> 15:27.592
Well, we're not
floating in space, are we?

15:27.592 --> 15:28.426
Well-
- I didn't see that

15:28.427 --> 15:29.261
in the script.

15:29.260 --> 15:31.329
Why, it's space.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.598
Well, for-
- You just-

15:32.597 --> 15:34.098
You assume the gravity
is the same as Earth?

15:34.099 --> 15:36.568
Well, I assume that we're
inside of a space station

15:36.567 --> 15:38.002
at the commander's quarters?

15:38.003 --> 15:40.205
You assume we're inside
of a space station?

15:40.205 --> 15:42.441
Well, then where are
the commander's quarters?

15:42.441 --> 15:44.176
Inside of a spaceship.

15:44.176 --> 15:45.644
Okay, so we're
inside of a spaceship.

15:45.644 --> 15:46.979
Not a station, a spaceship.

15:46.979 --> 15:50.482
Okay, so inside
of a spaceship.

15:50.481 --> 15:52.517
In my mind, because it wasn't-

15:53.686 --> 15:54.720
Let's just go again.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.288
Let's just go again.

15:56.288 --> 15:58.123
Just go again.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.625
It doesn't make
sense, but okay, fine.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.459
Well, just give me more space.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.428
Sure.

16:02.427 --> 16:03.394
Okay?

16:03.394 --> 16:04.195
Right.
- Howard?

16:04.196 --> 16:05.431
Howard, you okay?

16:05.431 --> 16:06.365
We ready to go to scene two?
- I'm not-

16:06.365 --> 16:07.900
It's been a long day, all right?

16:07.899 --> 16:09.968
Interior captain's
quarters, day.

16:09.969 --> 16:10.903
Okay.
- Well, Howard-

16:10.903 --> 16:12.104
She's just making me upset.

16:12.104 --> 16:13.639
Howard,
remember, it's my call.

16:13.639 --> 16:15.040
I say when she can go.

16:15.039 --> 16:16.040
But she's making me upset.
- I understand that.

16:16.041 --> 16:16.875
You're the writer.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.110
But you know what?

16:18.110 --> 16:19.078
We're on a time
crunch here, okay?

16:19.077 --> 16:20.745
I'm sorry, Nikki.

16:21.947 --> 16:23.248
You know, Howard, you
gotta be nice too.

16:23.248 --> 16:24.516
The actor is the driving part.

16:24.515 --> 16:26.184
All right.
- You know what? Let's just...

16:26.184 --> 16:27.618
We'll start fresh,
- I'm sorry.

16:27.619 --> 16:28.821
and we'll just forget it.
- I'm a professional.

16:28.821 --> 16:30.089
I'm a professional.

16:30.089 --> 16:31.023
Howard,
for the love of god.

16:31.023 --> 16:32.458
You're not the only one.

16:32.457 --> 16:33.691
Interior captain's-

16:33.692 --> 16:34.893
A professional.
- Let's just do it.

16:34.893 --> 16:35.661
Interior captain's
quarters, day.

16:35.660 --> 16:36.995
Okay sure.

16:36.995 --> 16:37.695
Sure, sure, sure.
- Okay, .

16:37.696 --> 16:38.530
All right.

16:40.466 --> 16:43.235
Interior's captain's
quarters, day.

16:44.168 --> 16:45.103
"Fleaowe?"

16:45.104 --> 16:46.238
"Commander, what is it?"

16:46.238 --> 16:47.106
What are you doing?

16:47.105 --> 16:48.339
What is-
- I'm in space.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.075
But it looks like
you're doing yoga.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.343
How is that yoga?

16:51.342 --> 16:52.110
Have you ever done yoga?
- It looks like Pilates

16:52.110 --> 16:53.511
or something.

16:53.511 --> 16:54.178
Pilates is laying

16:54.178 --> 16:55.346
on the floor.

16:55.346 --> 16:56.014
This was-
- I'm not laying.

16:56.014 --> 16:57.215
All right.

16:57.216 --> 16:57.750
Interior captain's
quarters, day.

16:57.750 --> 16:59.151
Okay.

16:59.150 --> 17:01.352
"Commander, what is it?"

17:01.352 --> 17:02.587
"Fleaowe."

17:02.587 --> 17:03.454
What are you doing
with your body?

17:04.757 --> 17:05.991
What would you like me to do?

17:05.990 --> 17:07.592
Just a
little less gravity.

17:07.593 --> 17:08.961
There was no gravity!

17:08.961 --> 17:10.162
Like, I can't float.

17:10.162 --> 17:11.530
The gravity is a
real thing on Earth.

17:11.529 --> 17:12.630
But a little less,

17:12.631 --> 17:13.799
take it like 10%.
- Right.

17:13.798 --> 17:15.665
So how would you like me to-
- 10%

17:15.665 --> 17:17.268
Here we go.

17:17.269 --> 17:18.704
"Fleaowe!"

17:18.703 --> 17:20.338
"Commander, what is it?"

17:21.339 --> 17:22.607
Now, you ain't .

17:22.607 --> 17:24.275
What is that?

17:24.276 --> 17:25.676
I said 10%.

17:25.675 --> 17:27.011
Okay, 10% better.
- Show me what

17:27.011 --> 17:28.546
10% looks like to you.
- Okay.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.183
So 10%, it's like this.

17:31.182 --> 17:32.316
"Commander, what is it?"

17:32.317 --> 17:34.019
I was just doing that.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.020
All right.
- That's like literally

17:35.019 --> 17:36.087
exactly what I just did.
- Okay.

17:36.087 --> 17:37.422
Go ahead.

17:37.423 --> 17:38.257
You do you.

17:38.257 --> 17:39.458
Let's see.

17:39.458 --> 17:41.994
Interior captain's
quarters, day.

17:43.194 --> 17:44.629
"Commander, what is it?"

17:44.630 --> 17:45.631
"Fleaowe."

17:46.898 --> 17:48.533
"Oh, no, it's a
bird, it's a plane."

17:48.534 --> 17:49.968
You went back to the...

17:49.968 --> 17:52.271
Go back-
- Don't go back to the thing,

17:52.270 --> 17:53.104
this thing.

17:53.105 --> 17:53.939
Just-
- I wasn't doing

17:53.939 --> 17:54.773
anything like this.

17:54.772 --> 17:55.873
Just do the-

17:55.874 --> 17:57.076
You were reading this.
- Just do the-

17:57.076 --> 17:58.343
You weren't even watching.
- Okay.

17:58.343 --> 18:00.145
All right.
- Mr. Original, can we...

18:00.144 --> 18:01.846
Can we pause for
a second, Howard?

18:02.980 --> 18:04.816
You're just a
goddamn screenwriter.

18:04.817 --> 18:06.652
Nikki, did you need
a five minute break,

18:06.652 --> 18:08.854
so I can talk to
Howard for a second?

18:08.854 --> 18:11.490
Howard, can you just get
behind the desk for a second?

18:11.490 --> 18:12.658
Yeah.

18:12.657 --> 18:13.825
Yeah.
- Thank you, Nikki.

18:13.826 --> 18:15.060
Yeah.
- Sorry about that.

18:15.059 --> 18:17.028
Thanks,

18:17.028 --> 18:18.729
Howard, what

18:18.730 --> 18:19.665
What?

18:19.664 --> 18:20.865
What are you...

18:20.865 --> 18:21.766
Goddammit, the
camera is rolling.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.135
You fuck it-
- Yeah.

18:23.134 --> 18:23.801
Let's cut the cameras, okay?
- No, you fuckin'

18:23.801 --> 18:25.002
embarrassed me.

18:25.002 --> 18:26.137
Well,
you know what?

18:26.137 --> 18:27.338
Now, you're on camera.
- You fuckin'

18:27.338 --> 18:28.005
embarrassed me.
- You're on camera,

18:28.006 --> 18:29.174

18:29.173 --> 18:30.141
talk to me like this,

18:30.142 --> 18:30.943

18:30.942 --> 18:32.110

18:32.111 --> 18:33.045
Okay.

Okay.

- Hi, guys.

18:35.079 --> 18:36.280
You wanna wave to the camera?

18:36.280 --> 18:37.315
This is Howard Original.

All right.

20:43.942 --> 20:45.077
Hello, Howard.

20:46.211 --> 20:47.179
Hey, Dave.

20:47.179 --> 20:49.414
How's the scripts going, Howie?

20:49.413 --> 20:51.249
You know, it's coming along.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.516
Oh, Howie.

20:52.517 --> 20:54.920
Coming along is always a lie.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.156
That's what I say when
I'm stuck at 500 words.

20:59.124 --> 21:00.559
You know me too well, Dave.

21:00.558 --> 21:02.560
Oh, Howie, I'm exhausted.

21:02.560 --> 21:07.565
You know, it's meeting,
after meeting, after meeting,

21:08.666 --> 21:10.201
and then after
some more meetings,

21:10.201 --> 21:14.171
and more meetings, and
then another meeting.

21:14.172 --> 21:15.107
I know it.

21:15.106 --> 21:16.307
Were there any good ones?

21:16.307 --> 21:18.542
Well, they just
loved the Australians.

21:18.542 --> 21:21.345
Did you know that were
referred to as Aussie's?

21:21.346 --> 21:23.548
Ozzy's, like Ozzy Osbourne's?

21:25.651 --> 21:26.752
Oh, Howie.

21:26.751 --> 21:27.918
I mean, yeah, Dave,

21:27.919 --> 21:30.455
you realize that
you're not Australian?

21:30.454 --> 21:31.989
You grew up in K-Town,

21:31.990 --> 21:34.126
and you lived in a pee
stained studio apartment

21:34.125 --> 21:36.093
for the majority of the 2000's.

21:36.094 --> 21:37.062
Shut up, Howard!

21:37.061 --> 21:38.796
The accent works.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.032
I Googled it.

21:40.031 --> 21:42.600
There are no Asian
people in Australia.

21:42.601 --> 21:43.802
Give me a break!

21:43.801 --> 21:45.036
Oh yeah, man!

21:45.037 --> 21:48.173
Weta in New Zealand
bought my feature film.

21:48.173 --> 21:51.943
They bought the script for
130,000 American dollars.

21:51.942 --> 21:53.611
They shoot early next year.

21:53.612 --> 21:54.680
It's scifi.

21:54.680 --> 21:55.514
A what?

21:55.513 --> 21:57.682
You know, a scifi.

21:58.517 --> 21:59.351
Ah, man.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.453
You mine, sci-fi?

22:01.452 --> 22:02.653
Yeah, that's what I said.

22:02.653 --> 22:04.855
Anyway, it's sci-fi,

22:04.855 --> 22:06.157
you know, space stuff.

22:06.157 --> 22:07.491
Matt Damon's in it.

22:07.491 --> 22:09.293
You know, James Franco
was going to be in it,

22:09.294 --> 22:12.097
but he's left town, and
his living on some island.

22:12.096 --> 22:13.898
Yeah, that sounds fun.

22:15.099 --> 22:16.033
Oh, I'd love to
stay and chat, Howie,

22:16.034 --> 22:18.270
but I've gotta take this call.

22:18.269 --> 22:19.570
Hello, Dave here.

22:19.570 --> 22:22.006
That's not a real phone, Dave.

22:22.007 --> 22:25.344
Yeah, well tell Martin
Scorsese I'll be free next week.

22:25.344 --> 22:27.112
That is a piece of fruit.

22:27.112 --> 22:28.480
You see that, Howard?

22:28.480 --> 22:31.450
I'm getting paid to
do this for a living.

22:31.450 --> 22:32.384
Look at that.

22:32.384 --> 22:33.685
Got another incoming call.

22:33.684 --> 22:34.952
I've gotta run.

22:34.952 --> 22:36.387
Yeah, hi, Steven.

22:37.455 --> 22:39.557
That's a banana, Dave.

22:39.557 --> 22:41.459
Spielberg, yes.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.261
That's nice, yeah.

22:43.260 --> 22:44.895
Yeah, I'll be free maybe,

22:44.895 --> 22:48.332
how 'bout Monday
afternoon, 2:00 pm?

22:48.333 --> 22:49.167
Great.

22:49.166 --> 22:50.067
See you then.

22:50.067 --> 22:51.035
Bye-bye.
- There you go,

22:51.036 --> 22:52.003
talking to a piece of fruit.

22:52.002 --> 22:53.604
Well, cheerio, Howard,

22:53.605 --> 22:56.375
and have yourself a bowl
of Frosted Flakes, too.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.909
Wrong country, Dave.

22:57.909 --> 22:59.678
Cheerios are for the French.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.246
You can rot in hell.

23:01.246 --> 23:02.481
Love you, you idiot.

23:02.480 --> 23:06.550
Well, goodbye, Dave.

23:06.550 --> 23:09.887
And the space cats

Listen, okay?

24:26.631 --> 24:29.167
I am usually not into
unemployed writers,

24:29.166 --> 24:32.970
but somehow, I find
you fascinating.

24:32.971 --> 24:35.273
Well, I'm gonna sell this thing,

24:35.272 --> 24:38.209
and then we're all
gonna move to Hawaii.

24:38.210 --> 24:39.044
If you think

24:39.044 --> 24:40.245
you're gonna sell this,

24:40.244 --> 24:41.979
then I will help
you make it better.

24:41.980 --> 24:43.648
Uh-huh.
- So let me help you.

24:43.647 --> 24:44.815
Okay.

Okay.

- No, no .

25:04.435 --> 25:05.936
Howie,

25:05.936 --> 25:10.474
you really screwed up big time
with the love of your life.

25:15.012 --> 25:18.682
But you don't have much
luck in love, do you?

25:18.682 --> 25:22.319
If you could only go
back and fix things?

25:28.226 --> 25:29.494
Hi, I'm Elizabeth Thomas,

25:29.493 --> 25:31.262
and I'll be reading
for Fleaowe today.

25:31.262 --> 25:32.096
It's already wrong.

25:32.096 --> 25:33.030
Okay, fine.

25:34.164 --> 25:35.065
That's fine.

25:35.066 --> 25:36.434
That was already wrong.

25:36.433 --> 25:37.635
What?

25:37.635 --> 25:39.270
Even
your slate was campy

25:39.270 --> 25:40.638
Well, okay.

25:40.638 --> 25:41.906
I mean, do you want-
- All right.

25:41.906 --> 25:42.873
Is that what
- Would you-

25:42.874 --> 25:44.109
you're going for?

25:44.108 --> 25:46.343
This is... Can we
do a serious one?

25:46.344 --> 25:47.579
Like a real serious-
- Oh, of course.

25:47.578 --> 25:49.213
Sure.
- Okay, okay.

25:49.213 --> 25:51.982
Interior captain's
quarters, day.

25:53.451 --> 25:54.719
"Fleaowe!"

25:54.719 --> 25:56.888
"Commander, what is it?"

25:58.890 --> 26:00.292
"Oh no!"

26:00.291 --> 26:04.128
"It's a bird, it's a
plane, it's a space kitty!"

26:04.128 --> 26:05.629
You have to say-
- Oh.

26:05.630 --> 26:06.631
You didn't read the script.

26:06.631 --> 26:07.866
It's a plan

26:07.865 --> 26:09.099
It's a plan.

26:09.099 --> 26:10.968
Plan? I thought-
- No, "It's a bird,

26:10.969 --> 26:11.937
it's a plan".

26:11.936 --> 26:12.770
Oh.
- It says in the script

26:12.770 --> 26:13.671
it's a plan.

26:13.672 --> 26:15.040
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

26:15.039 --> 26:16.674
I thought that was a typo-
- No, read the-

26:16.674 --> 26:17.841
Okay, so-
- Don't-

26:17.842 --> 26:19.044
No, this is....

26:19.044 --> 26:20.111
Words matter.

26:20.111 --> 26:21.713
So read it again,
- Oh.

26:21.712 --> 26:23.814
but read it as
written, please.

26:23.815 --> 26:25.483
Okay.

26:25.482 --> 26:26.917
"Oh, no!"

26:26.917 --> 26:30.487
"It's a bird, it's a
plan, it's a space kitty!"

26:31.890 --> 26:34.125
Why did you say that
like it was a broad word?

26:34.125 --> 26:35.292
Say it like it's the right word.

26:35.292 --> 26:36.360
Okay.

26:36.361 --> 26:37.562
Okay,

26:37.561 --> 26:38.696
just say it like-
- I just don't see how

26:38.696 --> 26:39.496
a plan would be coming
- Just say it.

26:39.497 --> 26:40.732
in space.

26:40.731 --> 26:42.900
Well, there's no guy
be a plane in space.

26:42.901 --> 26:44.369
It's a plan.

26:44.368 --> 26:46.537
Well, I mean, 'cause it says,
"It's a bird, it's a plan",

26:46.538 --> 26:48.707
it's a lot like that single-
- It's a plan.

26:48.707 --> 26:49.674
Just read it as written.

26:49.673 --> 26:50.574
Go ahead.
- Oh, okay.

26:50.575 --> 26:51.509
All right, go ahead,

26:51.509 --> 26:52.410
from the top.
- Oh, no!

26:52.410 --> 26:53.612
Okay.
- "Fleaowe!"

26:53.612 --> 26:55.981
"Commander, what is it?"

26:56.948 --> 26:58.383
"Oh, no!"

26:58.383 --> 27:01.920
"It's a bird, it's a
plan, it's a space kitty!"

27:03.320 --> 27:04.655
"A space kitty?"

27:05.690 --> 27:06.625
"Oh, wait."

27:06.625 --> 27:08.092
"No, it's just an asteroid."

27:08.093 --> 27:09.361
"No!"

27:09.361 --> 27:10.595
"Computer, how do
you frost a cake?"

27:10.595 --> 27:12.297
"Commander, I know
how to frost a cake."

27:12.297 --> 27:14.165
"Voice print confirmed."

27:14.164 --> 27:16.233
"Oh, stop showing off, Fleaowe."

27:16.233 --> 27:18.369
"In the future,
which we're in now,

27:18.369 --> 27:20.504
computers are superior
to...", which is true.

27:20.505 --> 27:23.274
In the future, that's
what's gonna happen.

27:23.273 --> 27:24.608
It's gonna be...

27:24.608 --> 27:25.542
You know, women...

27:25.542 --> 27:27.044
Women will be, you know...

27:27.045 --> 27:28.580
Computers will be-
- Wait!

27:28.579 --> 27:30.814
Are you being... Are you just
talking about on this script,

27:30.815 --> 27:31.783
or were you-
- No, I'm not talking

27:31.782 --> 27:32.716
about in the script.

27:32.717 --> 27:34.886
I'm talking about in the future,

27:34.885 --> 27:36.754
which we assume-

27:36.755 --> 27:38.056
So you have to
read the rest of it

27:38.056 --> 27:40.091
like assuming that
that's what it is.

27:40.090 --> 27:41.392
Okay.

27:41.393 --> 27:42.894
And I'm sorry about
before, though.

27:42.894 --> 27:44.562
'Cause like, you know...

27:44.561 --> 27:46.096
Okay, I'm just the writer.

27:46.096 --> 27:47.331
I understand-
- It's all right.

27:47.332 --> 27:48.566
No, I understand-
- I wanna do whatever

27:48.566 --> 27:50.402
to achieve your vision.
- I'm just the writer,

27:50.402 --> 27:51.836
and words count, right?

27:51.836 --> 27:53.905
Words matter, okay?

27:53.904 --> 27:55.506
So we'll go over it again.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.342
And I feel much better now, so.

27:57.342 --> 27:58.376
Okay?
- Okay.

27:58.375 --> 27:59.576
All right, so let's-
- Sure.

27:59.576 --> 28:00.477
Let's do that.

28:00.478 --> 28:01.946
And-

28:01.945 --> 28:03.213
"No!"

28:03.213 --> 28:04.748
"Computer, how do
you frost a cake?"

28:04.749 --> 28:06.685
"Commander, I know
how to frost a cake."

28:06.684 --> 28:08.118
"Stop showing off, Fleaowe."

28:08.118 --> 28:10.454
"In the future, as we're in now,

28:10.454 --> 28:12.423
computers are
superior to women."

28:12.423 --> 28:13.257
"Sorry..."

28:13.258 --> 28:14.426
Oh, that's your line.

28:14.425 --> 28:15.726
"Sorry, Commander,
but remember,

28:15.727 --> 28:18.630
I was in the deep freeze
more than 100 years."

28:18.630 --> 28:19.864
You see, you're
doing that voice?

28:19.864 --> 28:21.466
I was trying to give
you kind of a cue.

28:21.465 --> 28:22.733
Voice?

28:22.733 --> 28:25.502
Well, that's just
my natural voice.

28:25.502 --> 28:27.538
Howard, would-
- I mean, what kind of-

28:27.538 --> 28:29.373
Howard, what are
you talking about? What voice?

28:29.374 --> 28:30.975
She's doing a
voice for the part.

28:30.974 --> 28:31.809
It's campy.

28:31.809 --> 28:33.010
Okay.

28:33.010 --> 28:33.944
Howard, it's called acting.
- Wait!

28:33.944 --> 28:35.012
She can do...

28:35.012 --> 28:35.946
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.
- Do you-

28:35.946 --> 28:36.780
I'm sorry, do you want campy,

28:36.780 --> 28:38.048
or to-
- What made you-

28:38.048 --> 28:40.984
What made you feel
that it was campy?

28:40.984 --> 28:43.554
What's campy about this?

28:43.555 --> 28:44.689
Howard?

28:44.689 --> 28:46.391
I-
- What is campy about this?

28:46.391 --> 28:47.559
Hey-

28:47.558 --> 28:48.492
Okay, I'm sorry.
- Okay, on a spaceship-

28:48.492 --> 28:49.727
I didn't mean to like come-

28:49.728 --> 28:51.296
They're trying to
rescue space kittens.

28:51.296 --> 28:52.664
What's campy-

28:52.663 --> 28:54.198
'Cause this is not like-
- What is campy?

28:54.199 --> 28:55.467
No, I wanna know what you-

28:55.467 --> 28:56.367
No, don't-
- Howard,

28:56.366 --> 28:57.601
No.
- let's all-

28:57.602 --> 28:58.737
Howard, let's take
- What is campy?

28:58.737 --> 29:00.238
a five minute break.
- Do you want-

29:00.238 --> 29:00.905
Elizabeth, if
you need to step outside

29:00.904 --> 29:01.972
for a minute,

29:01.972 --> 29:02.973
Oh.
- I'm gonna yell,

29:02.973 --> 29:03.974
I meant, talk to Howard.
- Sure.

29:03.974 --> 29:04.775
You're just an actor!
- Yeah.

29:04.776 --> 29:05.577
Okay.

29:07.578 --> 29:10.447
You know, actually, I'm not
interested in this anymore.

29:10.448 --> 29:11.516
Howard!
- Don't make a choice.

29:11.516 --> 29:12.684
I'm so sorry.

29:12.683 --> 29:14.852
It's about choices.

29:14.853 --> 29:16.354
It's about choices.

29:16.354 --> 29:18.723
Howard, what the
fuck is your problem, dude?

29:18.722 --> 29:19.857
Come on!

29:19.857 --> 29:21.058
Actors.
- You know what?

29:21.058 --> 29:22.359
It's campy.
- Let's cut this.

29:22.359 --> 29:23.460
Let's cut this, guys. Come on!
- Oh, I'm campy.

29:23.461 --> 29:24.863
Let's cut.
- I'm campy.

Hold on .

31:40.832 --> 31:42.500
"Dear Mr. Original,"

31:42.500 --> 31:44.903
"This is Natalie Rodriguez."

31:44.903 --> 31:48.740
"I just finished reading your
screenplay 'Space Kitties'."

31:48.740 --> 31:49.774
"I loved it!"

31:51.209 --> 31:53.044
"Give me a call at your
earliest convenience."

31:53.044 --> 31:56.314
"My number is in the
signature below."

31:56.314 --> 31:57.181
Yes!

31:57.181 --> 31:58.349
Yeah!

31:58.348 --> 32:02.085
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

32:22.839 --> 32:24.007
Who?

32:24.842 --> 32:25.677
Hello?

32:25.676 --> 32:26.610
Yes, Hi.

32:26.611 --> 32:28.313
Can I speak to Ms. Rodriguez?

32:28.313 --> 32:29.213
Speaking.

32:30.882 --> 32:32.984
Yeah, well, this
is Howard Original.

32:32.983 --> 32:33.817
Oh, yes.

32:33.817 --> 32:35.052
Hi, Howard.

32:35.053 --> 32:37.622
Yeah, I had a script
called "Space Kittens".

32:37.622 --> 32:38.823
Yeah, well it's on the-
- Yeah.

32:38.823 --> 32:40.124
You like it, right?

32:40.124 --> 32:41.326
Haven't had a chance

32:41.326 --> 32:44.462
to read it yet, but it's
on the list, mm-hmm.

32:44.461 --> 32:47.230
Well, okay, so
there's an option.

32:47.230 --> 32:49.967
Well, I'm available
to come in tomorrow.

32:49.968 --> 32:51.502
I'm really excited to
talk to you about it.

32:51.501 --> 32:52.970
Yeah, well my
assistant should've sent

32:52.971 --> 32:54.472
an email to re-schedule,

32:54.471 --> 32:57.941
Okay.
- so you should have that.

32:57.942 --> 32:59.477
Oh, .

32:59.477 --> 33:00.745
Well, we don't get
service up here.

33:00.744 --> 33:02.713
So I missed your,

33:02.713 --> 33:03.880
I missed the meeting, I guess.

33:03.881 --> 33:05.850
I missed the message.

33:05.849 --> 33:09.152
Well, we'll speak
tomorrow, mm-kay?

33:09.153 --> 33:09.988
Oh, well, okay.

33:09.988 --> 33:10.822
You gotta go?

33:10.821 --> 33:12.022
Okay, well have

33:12.022 --> 33:12.789
a nice weekend.
- Gotta go, bye-bye.

33:13.991 --> 33:17.594
Okay, we'll talk about
it next, next year.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.634
Oh, wow!

34:44.114 --> 34:46.583
I wish I could show Ms.
Rodriguez who I really am,

34:46.583 --> 34:49.786
suave, handsome,
and a great dancer.

34:49.786 --> 34:52.054
You're an idiot.

34:55.793 --> 34:56.726
Dammit!

36:03.427 --> 36:06.297
Hey, Hannah, did I
tell you the good news?

36:06.297 --> 36:07.832
What?

36:07.831 --> 36:11.101
So remember, I
contacted Danny Trejo?

36:12.202 --> 36:13.403
Yeah.

36:13.403 --> 36:15.305
Well, his manager
got back to me,

36:15.306 --> 36:17.975
and while Danny's not available,

36:19.744 --> 36:21.212
his sister Jamie is.

36:21.211 --> 36:22.846
Jamie Trejo.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.183
That's awesome.
- So we've gotYeah.

36:25.182 --> 36:26.716
But that's just that
letter, you know?

36:26.717 --> 36:28.886
That's just saying
like, you know,

36:28.885 --> 36:31.087
that she's okay
with the production,

36:31.088 --> 36:32.924
and that we're gonna
make this movie,

36:32.923 --> 36:37.060
and it's gonna start-
- Howie, I'm pregnant.

36:38.128 --> 36:39.462
Your pregnant?

36:40.898 --> 36:42.466
That's great!

36:42.465 --> 36:43.700
That's such good news.

36:43.701 --> 36:44.635
Yeah?

36:44.635 --> 36:46.270
Can't you tell I'm excited?

36:46.269 --> 36:47.637
Yeah, I just wanna make sure!

36:47.637 --> 36:48.939
I mean, we haven't
planned for this,

36:48.940 --> 36:50.174
so-
- Come here!

36:51.409 --> 36:52.276
Yeah?

36:52.275 --> 36:53.176
Come here.

36:53.177 --> 36:54.345
Yeah.
- Oh my god!

36:54.344 --> 36:55.912
Howie?

36:55.913 --> 36:57.181
Are we gonna do this?

36:57.181 --> 36:58.449
Are we ready?

36:59.617 --> 37:02.086
I mean,
I think we are.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.023
We've get no choice, right?

37:06.023 --> 37:07.291
This is so good

37:08.358 --> 37:11.061
to be happening to us, right?

37:11.061 --> 37:12.429
Yeah.

37:12.429 --> 37:14.097
I'm just so happy that
you're this happy!

37:14.097 --> 37:14.931
I am.
- I didn't know

37:14.931 --> 37:15.865
what you were gonna say,

37:15.865 --> 37:17.100
or how you were gonna react.

37:17.101 --> 37:19.470
I'm as happy as
Jamie Trejo is.

37:19.469 --> 37:21.071
Guess my swimmers, my boys,

37:21.072 --> 37:22.540

37:29.646 --> 37:30.947
Yeah, I'm ready.

37:30.947 --> 37:32.082
I'm ready to do this.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.084
Let's do it!

37:34.184 --> 37:35.919
Okay.

37:35.920 --> 37:36.854
Good.

37:36.853 --> 37:38.288
I'm happy for us.

37:41.324 --> 37:45.095
Okay, so I guess we
should go to the doctor?

37:46.197 --> 37:47.498
I guess so.

37:47.498 --> 37:48.499
All right.

37:49.867 --> 37:53.904
Well, obviously, I've
never done this before, so.

37:53.903 --> 37:56.573
Mm-hmm.

38:13.123 --> 38:15.558
Howie,
you can't ignore me.

38:21.965 --> 38:23.233
I'm in your head.

38:23.233 --> 38:24.234
It's Kendra.

38:25.402 --> 38:27.370
I'm going to get
you through this.

38:27.371 --> 38:31.575
Go to your happy/unhappy place.

Wow!

39:10.380 --> 39:12.349
You're beautiful.

39:12.349 --> 39:13.917
Wrong, you are.

39:14.918 --> 39:15.985
Wrong, you're.

39:17.355 --> 39:18.389
How are you?

39:18.389 --> 39:19.223
Good.

39:20.157 --> 39:22.460
Ready for our big night out?

39:22.460 --> 39:23.294
Yes.

39:41.411 --> 39:43.313
You know, I love you.

39:44.849 --> 39:45.916
I love you too, Howie.

39:45.916 --> 39:46.751
Thanks.

39:55.693 --> 39:57.061
Hey, Blue.

39:57.061 --> 39:57.895
Hey, Blue.

39:58.896 --> 40:00.965
You like that pen, don't you?

40:00.965 --> 40:02.900
A writer writes, Blue.

40:02.900 --> 40:05.936
This is the most important
thing a writer can use.

40:05.936 --> 40:07.605
That's right, a pen.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.308
That's right, a pen.

40:11.307 --> 40:13.443
Can you hold a pen?

40:13.443 --> 40:14.778
That's right.

40:14.778 --> 40:15.712
That's right, Blue.

40:15.713 --> 40:17.748

Hi, my name is

41:24.648 --> 41:25.850
Samantha,

41:25.849 --> 41:27.884
and I'm auditioning for
the role of Fleaowe.

41:28.952 --> 41:29.886
Thanks.

41:31.387 --> 41:33.022
Okay, I'll be
reading with you.

41:33.891 --> 41:35.292
Oh, sorry.

41:35.291 --> 41:36.493
Oh, what the heck?

41:36.494 --> 41:37.161
Wrong hand.
- Yeah,

41:37.161 --> 41:38.195
The other hand.

41:38.195 --> 41:40.464
This, the good hand.

41:40.463 --> 41:41.297
Yeah, okay.

41:41.297 --> 41:42.265
I'm sorry.

41:42.266 --> 41:43.534
All right.

41:43.534 --> 41:44.368
Interior.

41:46.836 --> 41:47.670
I'm sorry.

41:47.670 --> 41:48.505
Can we start over?

41:48.505 --> 41:49.906
Are you like in pain?

41:49.907 --> 41:50.741
Oh, no, no, no.

41:50.740 --> 41:52.242
I just...

41:52.242 --> 41:54.110
I got so into character
that I got out of character.

41:54.110 --> 41:54.944
Okay.

41:55.778 --> 41:57.614
So you're in space?

41:57.614 --> 42:00.283
In space, flying
through space.

42:00.284 --> 42:01.085
'Cause she gets it.

42:01.085 --> 42:02.052
Okay.

42:02.052 --> 42:03.254
All right.

42:03.253 --> 42:04.854
Interior captain's
quarters, day.

42:04.855 --> 42:07.391
"Commander, what is it?"

42:07.391 --> 42:08.692
Can you point?

42:08.692 --> 42:10.361
It's a space. Can you point?
- Yeah, yeah.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.294
Point.
- Yeah, yeah, I can.

42:11.295 --> 42:12.029
Can you point?

42:12.028 --> 42:13.196
Yes, I can.

42:13.197 --> 42:16.133
Okay, go ahead.
- Thank you.

42:16.132 --> 42:17.534
"Oh, no!"

42:17.534 --> 42:20.603
"It's a bird, it's a
plane, it's a space kitty!"

42:20.603 --> 42:21.571
"A space kitty?"

42:21.572 --> 42:23.607
"Oh, no, it's just an asteroid."

42:24.708 --> 42:25.910
"Stop showing off, Fleaowe."

42:25.909 --> 42:28.244
"In the future,
which we're in now,

42:28.244 --> 42:30.847
computers are
superior to women."

42:30.847 --> 42:32.081
"Commander, I'm sorry,

42:32.081 --> 42:33.016
but remember, I was
in the deep freeze

42:33.016 --> 42:34.984
for more than 100 years."

42:36.253 --> 42:39.723
"Damn, Fleaowe, I
will not fail you."

42:39.722 --> 42:40.924
"I'll forgive you this time."

42:40.925 --> 42:42.693
So what's your objective?

42:42.693 --> 42:44.228
"My Objective?"

42:44.228 --> 42:45.462
"Right!"

42:45.461 --> 42:48.865
"Is to rescue all
the baby space cats,

42:48.865 --> 42:50.934
and bring them home
to Scratching Post 4."

42:51.869 --> 42:54.071
"You mean 5."
- "Right!"

42:54.070 --> 42:55.338
One, two, three, four, five.

42:56.806 --> 42:58.875
"Good, excellent, great, and?"
- "And I'm here to serve

42:58.876 --> 43:01.579
all my Commander's
needs this mission,

43:01.579 --> 43:03.781
and physical, if necessary."

43:03.780 --> 43:04.614
"Right."

43:04.614 --> 43:05.848
"Remember, Fleaowe,

43:05.849 --> 43:07.952
we'll have plenty of
downtime on the ship."

43:07.952 --> 43:10.754
"So you're gonna get a big
promotion after the rescue."

43:12.655 --> 43:15.091
"Okay, Commander, look
at the Alpha Screen!"

43:15.092 --> 43:16.293
"We have a cataract."

43:16.293 --> 43:17.227
"What's that?"

43:17.226 --> 43:18.328
"It's a type of cat attack."

43:18.329 --> 43:19.763
"Battle stations!"

43:19.762 --> 43:21.497
"Commander, I don't
have my spacesuit."

43:21.498 --> 43:23.500
"It's in my chamber
on Level Deck 41"

43:23.500 --> 43:26.337
"Here, put this
on", if you can.

43:27.170 --> 43:28.137
"Put this on."

43:28.137 --> 43:30.873
"Privacy?"

43:30.873 --> 43:31.975
"Just put it on, Fleaowe."

43:31.976 --> 43:33.510
"Stop being a baby."

43:35.846 --> 43:37.114
I'm sorry. I can't do
this with this cast.

43:37.114 --> 43:37.948
Oh.
- I can't do this

43:37.947 --> 43:39.148
with the cast on it.

43:39.148 --> 43:40.483
Howard-
- No, I can't do...

43:40.483 --> 43:41.417
I can't do this with...

43:41.418 --> 43:42.620
All right, we'll try it.

43:42.619 --> 43:44.087
Ahoy.

43:44.088 --> 43:45.756
Ahoy.
- I'm pretty sure

43:45.755 --> 43:47.724
she's gonna bang herself
in the head with this cast.

43:47.724 --> 43:48.658
I'm so sorry.

43:48.659 --> 43:49.927
When is this cast coming off?

43:49.927 --> 43:51.228
Does the cast bother you?
- Actually-

43:51.228 --> 43:52.196
If it doesn't-
- Actually-

43:52.195 --> 43:53.096
No, no, .

43:53.097 --> 43:54.031
We're cross-talking.

43:54.030 --> 43:55.231
When does this cast come off.

43:55.231 --> 43:56.199
Actually, never.

43:56.199 --> 43:57.467
It's on for life.

43:57.467 --> 43:58.768
Do you...

43:58.768 --> 44:01.037
Yeah, can you gesture
to the screen?

44:01.038 --> 44:02.439
You already pointed.

44:02.438 --> 44:03.606
Oh, yeah.
- Just gesture to the screen.

44:03.606 --> 44:04.540
Okay.

44:04.541 --> 44:05.342
Now, gesture, like this.

44:05.342 --> 44:06.877
Gesture to the screen.

44:06.876 --> 44:08.745
"Commander, look
at the Alpha Screen."

44:08.746 --> 44:09.847
"We have a cataract."

44:09.847 --> 44:11.215
I can't with this cast.

44:11.215 --> 44:12.049
I just...

44:12.048 --> 44:13.449
How is she gonna

44:13.449 --> 44:14.684
put a spacesuit on?
- Howard. Howard, do you...

44:14.684 --> 44:15.618
Jesus Christ.

44:16.619 --> 44:17.854
All right, that's helping.

44:17.855 --> 44:18.689
That's helping.

44:18.688 --> 44:19.922
That looks good.

44:19.922 --> 44:21.024
That's definitely helping.

44:21.025 --> 44:21.992
Okay.
- One, two.

44:21.992 --> 44:23.994
All right.

44:23.994 --> 44:25.262
Matter of fact, I
wanna see that again.

44:25.262 --> 44:26.497
Can you...

44:26.496 --> 44:27.630
Yeah, here, put
this spacesuit on.

44:27.630 --> 44:29.465
Yeah.

44:29.465 --> 44:31.200
Well, I gotta take
the first one off, actually.

44:31.201 --> 44:32.169
Oh, good.

44:33.670 --> 44:35.371
Wait, we have
another spacesuit for you.

44:35.371 --> 44:36.339
Ah, thank you.

44:36.340 --> 44:37.408
Okay, good.
- All right.

44:37.407 --> 44:39.208
All right, all right.

44:39.208 --> 44:41.544
Well, that looks...
- All right.

44:41.545 --> 44:43.347
That looks good.

44:43.347 --> 44:45.215
That's all I need. Here, put-
- How do I look?

44:45.215 --> 44:46.984
Here,
put this bikini on.

44:46.983 --> 44:48.151
Let's stop there.

44:48.152 --> 44:49.453
Thank you.

44:49.452 --> 44:50.987
That was a beautiful audition.

44:50.987 --> 44:53.423
Howard, can I talk to
you like afterward?

44:53.423 --> 44:54.757
Well, we
have her info, right?

44:54.757 --> 44:56.125
Yeah,
well, I'll be in touch.

44:57.061 --> 44:58.195
You won't be in touch, Howard.

44:58.195 --> 44:59.997
I will call you, not Howard.

44:59.996 --> 45:01.831
So thank you, thank you.

45:01.831 --> 45:02.999
Are you on Instagram?

45:03.000 --> 45:04.000
I'm actually
untraceable online.

45:04.001 --> 45:05.969
But it was so nice meeting you.

45:05.969 --> 45:07.638
Oh, okay. Nice to meet you.
- And thank you

45:07.637 --> 45:08.871
for the opportunity,

45:08.871 --> 45:10.206
Good to see you.
- and have

45:10.206 --> 45:12.709
a wonderful day.
- Good luck with the thing,

45:12.710 --> 45:13.777
with the thing.
- Oh, thank you.

45:13.777 --> 45:14.611
Howard, let's talk.

45:14.610 --> 45:15.845
Okay.

45:15.846 --> 45:17.014
All right, all right.

45:17.014 --> 45:18.248
Take care, bye.
- Thank you.

45:18.248 --> 45:19.383
I can't
with this cast.

45:19.382 --> 45:20.583
I'm sorry.
- Have a good day.

45:20.583 --> 45:21.517
Howard, get the door for her.
- I can't.

45:21.518 --> 45:22.186
Please, help her.

45:22.186 --> 45:22.853
Get this...

45:22.853 --> 45:23.387
You know what?

45:23.387 --> 45:24.188
Get out.

45:24.188 --> 45:25.289
Get out, goodbye.

45:25.289 --> 45:26.090
Howard!

45:26.090 --> 45:27.324
What the fuck, Howard?

45:27.324 --> 45:28.459
You're gonna break
- I can't with the-

45:28.458 --> 45:29.659
her other arm!
- I can't with the cast.

45:29.659 --> 45:30.460
You're
gonna break her other...

45:30.460 --> 45:31.894
Let's just cut there.

45:31.894 --> 45:32.695
I can't with the cast.

45:32.695 --> 45:33.930
Cut, let's cut.

45:33.931 --> 45:34.598
Howard, you're such
a fuckin' asshole.

45:35.865 --> 45:37.066
But I must warn
you, Mr. Original,

45:37.067 --> 45:38.402
she's in a mood.

45:39.335 --> 45:41.237
Must be on her period?

45:58.621 --> 46:00.022
Howard Original.

46:00.023 --> 46:00.824
Hi.

46:02.358 --> 46:05.361
So we've got good
news and bad news.

46:06.730 --> 46:09.500
Sorry, Mr. Original, but
your script, "Space Kittens",

46:09.500 --> 46:11.435
it's not gonna work for us.

46:11.434 --> 46:13.136
So what's the good news?

46:13.137 --> 46:17.708
The good news for the studio
is that we passed on it.

46:20.309 --> 46:22.712
Okay, I see that look
on you guys' faces.

46:22.713 --> 46:26.550
Anybody want some coffee,
or tea, or caffeine?

46:27.985 --> 46:29.586
Boss, watch your blood pressure.

46:30.853 --> 46:31.854
Oh, I get it.

46:31.855 --> 46:34.024
So diversity got me again?

46:35.425 --> 46:39.830
I bet if this was ,

46:39.829 --> 46:42.231
you'd buy it pretty
quickly, wouldn't you?

46:42.231 --> 46:44.066
Starring Erik
Estrada from "Chips",

46:44.067 --> 46:46.370
and I'm gettin' Lou
Diamond Phillips.

46:46.369 --> 46:49.672
Make whatever excuse for your
work being unusable garbage,

46:49.672 --> 46:51.374
but don't go there.

46:51.375 --> 46:54.244
Now, if you excuse us,
we have a very busy day.

46:54.244 --> 46:56.880
Jordan Peele is my 12 o'clock

46:56.880 --> 46:57.815
Peele?

46:57.815 --> 46:59.316
I bet if I was a named writer,

46:59.315 --> 47:02.585
you would hire me without
even reading my script?

47:02.585 --> 47:05.388
Maybe I should just
give up writing

47:05.389 --> 47:08.559
and become some mindless,
brainless studio exec.

47:08.559 --> 47:10.027
Maybe you should
give up writing.

47:10.027 --> 47:13.230
I, at least, have a job,
you talentless hack.

47:13.230 --> 47:16.066
Harry Potter lookin'-
- Boss, Boss!

47:17.467 --> 47:19.837
You know the problem
with you, Ms. Rodriguez?

47:19.836 --> 47:21.604
You hold all the cards.

47:21.605 --> 47:23.207
You hold all the green cards.

47:23.206 --> 47:24.640
Funny.

47:24.641 --> 47:27.644
Boss, I can call security
to remove this man.

47:27.643 --> 47:29.245
No, I
can handle this.

47:29.246 --> 47:30.547
Oh, okay.

47:30.547 --> 47:32.816
You know who you
are, Mr. Original?

47:32.815 --> 47:34.250
You're nothing but
a white, privileged,

47:34.251 --> 47:36.920
ex-frat guy who
peaked in college.

47:36.920 --> 47:39.056
Shouldn't you be on
a golf course by now?

47:39.056 --> 47:41.124
That's a perfect
example, a golf course.

47:41.123 --> 47:42.758
That's what Hispanics
are good for,

47:42.759 --> 47:45.996
you know, mowing the grass
and cutting the lawn.

47:45.996 --> 47:48.265
You know, this used to
be like a movie studio,

47:48.264 --> 47:49.966
and now it's a Home Depot.

47:49.967 --> 47:52.769
You know, you look too young
to even be working here.

47:52.768 --> 47:54.503
Like, when is your quinceanera?

47:55.639 --> 47:57.007
Look at bar mitzvah
boy over here.

47:57.007 --> 47:58.041
Good one.

47:59.108 --> 48:00.576
If I was Jewish,

48:00.577 --> 48:02.713
I wouldn't go looking to
you for money, now, would I?

48:02.713 --> 48:04.681
Okay, okay.

48:04.681 --> 48:08.452
You've said some stuff
that you really don't mean,

48:08.452 --> 48:11.288
and Boss, you said
some stuff too.

48:12.422 --> 48:13.690
You pointed out
that she's Mexican,

48:13.690 --> 48:16.894
and she's biased against
you because of it.

48:16.893 --> 48:21.097
And you called him a
Jewish Harry Potter.

48:21.097 --> 48:24.333
Can we just be friends
and shake on it?

48:26.202 --> 48:27.036
All right.

48:27.036 --> 48:27.870
Okay, I'm sorry.

48:27.871 --> 48:28.705
I'm sorry.

48:28.704 --> 48:30.473
I'm a professional.

48:30.474 --> 48:31.742
I'm sorry I said
all those things,

48:31.742 --> 48:33.310
but before I go,

48:33.309 --> 48:34.277
I just wanna let you know,

48:34.277 --> 48:35.578
that some of us older guys

48:35.579 --> 48:38.148
remember when the
studio was truly great,

48:38.148 --> 48:39.616
when it was run by white people,

48:39.615 --> 48:41.751
not run by you people.

48:41.751 --> 48:43.252
You people?

48:43.253 --> 48:45.656
Did you just "you people" us?

48:45.655 --> 48:46.656
Adios, Nazi!

48:47.690 --> 48:49.191
Out of here!

48:49.192 --> 48:51.495
Let me just tell
you something, okay?

48:51.494 --> 48:53.095
This used to be
Columbia Pictures.

48:53.096 --> 48:54.665
Now, it's a Chipotle.

48:54.664 --> 48:57.500
You know where the door is!

49:09.211 --> 49:12.081
Hmm, Chipotle
actually sounds good.

49:12.081 --> 49:13.950
Grubhub or Uber Eats?

49:13.951 --> 49:14.918
I have the apps.

49:14.918 --> 49:15.752
I'm on it.

49:23.527 --> 49:24.928
Oh, Mr. Original?

49:26.563 --> 49:27.664
Yeah, I know.

49:27.664 --> 49:28.999
My car is being towed.

49:28.998 --> 49:31.867
Oh, no, I wanted
to talk to you.

49:31.867 --> 49:34.070
You wanna talk to me?

49:34.070 --> 49:35.304
Yeah.

49:35.304 --> 49:37.673
I read your script,
and it was impressive.

49:37.673 --> 49:38.975
You read "Space Cats"?

49:38.976 --> 49:40.043
Yes, I did.

49:41.077 --> 49:42.578
She just threw
it in the trash.

49:42.579 --> 49:44.448
Well, she's a bitch.

49:44.447 --> 49:46.015
She's just jealous.

49:47.384 --> 49:50.754
I mean, maybe if
you got to know me,

49:50.753 --> 49:52.288
you'd be inspired,

49:52.289 --> 49:53.857
and have something to write?

49:53.856 --> 49:55.891
Every writer needs a muse.

49:57.226 --> 49:58.894
Well, I-
- So?

49:58.894 --> 50:00.096
I get it.

50:00.097 --> 50:02.232
I understand what
you're saying, though.

50:02.231 --> 50:05.234
But, look, good luck  back there.

50:05.235 --> 50:06.336
Have fun.

50:06.335 --> 50:07.570
Mr. Original,

50:08.972 --> 50:10.207
I have clients,

50:11.375 --> 50:14.845
and I'm on my way to
becoming what she is.

50:14.844 --> 50:16.879
So I could give
"Space Cats" a chance,

50:16.880 --> 50:19.816
but once those checks
start rolling in,

50:19.815 --> 50:22.451
I will be taking 51%.

50:22.452 --> 50:24.654
You'd be taking 49.

50:24.653 --> 50:25.654
Got it?

50:25.655 --> 50:27.090
Okay, got it.

50:27.090 --> 50:28.058
Boop.

50:30.726 --> 50:31.560
Howard!

50:32.396 --> 50:33.330
What?

50:34.797 --> 50:36.032
Oh!

50:38.501 --> 50:39.702
Wow!

50:39.702 --> 50:41.203
What was that?

50:41.204 --> 50:42.039
What?

50:42.039 --> 50:42.873
Are you...

50:42.873 --> 50:43.707
Are you on the pill?

50:43.706 --> 50:44.807
Up periscope.

50:44.807 --> 50:46.642
Yeah.
- Well, oh, yeah.

50:46.643 --> 50:47.844
Yeah.
- I could tell.

50:47.844 --> 50:48.979
You could tell?
- Something's different.

50:48.978 --> 50:49.979
You could tell?
- Yeah.

50:49.980 --> 50:50.981
Uh-huh.

50:50.981 --> 50:52.749
Wow.

50:52.748 --> 50:56.018
I mean, you disappear into the
bathroom for like 20 minutes,

50:56.018 --> 51:00.423
and then you come in, and
last only like 15 seconds.

51:00.423 --> 51:01.690
Keep doing what you're doing.

51:01.690 --> 51:03.526
Well, I'm glad you liked it,

51:03.527 --> 51:04.961
because
- Oh, yeah.

51:04.960 --> 51:07.163
I want you to do me a
favor, a little quid pro quo,

51:07.164 --> 51:08.265
or whatever they call that,

51:08.264 --> 51:09.098
Uh-huh.
- you know,

51:09.099 --> 51:10.033
do something for me.

51:10.032 --> 51:10.900
Where are you

51:10.900 --> 51:12.101
going with this?
- Yeah.

51:12.101 --> 51:13.369
Yeah?
- So take that good feeling,

51:13.369 --> 51:15.404
and when you're
at the pitch fest,

51:15.405 --> 51:17.340
I want you to bring
up "Space Cats",

51:17.340 --> 51:19.342
'cause you're important
in the industry,

51:19.342 --> 51:21.678
and you can pitch it,

51:21.677 --> 51:22.611
and-
- Yeah.

51:23.447 --> 51:24.781
Uh-huh.

51:24.780 --> 51:25.648
I'm hungry.

51:25.648 --> 51:27.650
Is there any...

51:27.650 --> 51:29.752
Is there any food,

51:29.753 --> 51:30.987
like any restaurants

51:30.987 --> 51:32.189
that you think are open?
- You know, you threw

51:32.188 --> 51:34.023
out everything.

51:34.023 --> 51:35.991
But you've read the script,

51:35.992 --> 51:37.561
and you liked it?

51:37.561 --> 51:38.628
And you like it.
- Yeah, I got-

51:38.628 --> 51:40.730
I got the five emails,

51:40.730 --> 51:42.265
and your phone call.
- Uh-huh.

51:42.264 --> 51:43.766
My assistant went over it.

51:43.766 --> 51:45.734
But the premise is good.

51:47.570 --> 51:49.371
The characters,

51:49.371 --> 51:51.040
great character dynamics.

51:51.041 --> 51:52.275
Great character dynamic.
- But look,

51:52.275 --> 51:53.810
the premise is great.
- Right?

51:53.809 --> 51:55.811
The second act, right?

51:55.811 --> 51:56.645
Right?

51:56.646 --> 51:58.181
The woman's a man.

51:58.181 --> 51:59.850
Hey, so I'm
gonna go order some pizza,

51:59.849 --> 52:01.650
so let me know what you want.
- Okay.

52:01.650 --> 52:03.686
Okay, how 'bout anchovies?

52:03.686 --> 52:05.588
I'm vegan.

52:05.588 --> 52:06.422
Fuck!

52:07.690 --> 52:11.527
Vegan.

52:13.295 --> 52:14.730
Oh!

52:14.731 --> 52:16.133
Uh-uh.

52:16.132 --> 52:18.334
What's
going on over here?

52:18.335 --> 52:19.636
What is this?

52:19.635 --> 52:20.803
Salad dressing.

52:20.804 --> 52:21.571
Uh-huh, yeah, I know.

52:21.570 --> 52:23.205
It's expired,

52:23.206 --> 52:26.476
Uh-huh.
- and it's been expired, 2016?

52:27.409 --> 52:29.245
Yeah, that was a good year.

52:29.246 --> 52:30.947
This stuff doesn't go bad.
- You're kidding, right?

52:30.947 --> 52:32.782
Yeah.

52:32.782 --> 52:34.284
Oh, I'm not even
gonna smell this.

52:34.284 --> 52:35.452
This is bad.
- Uh-huh.

52:35.452 --> 52:36.953
Throw this away.

52:36.952 --> 52:40.356
Why are you holding onto
this random junk in here?

52:40.356 --> 52:42.625
It's not random.
- This is-

52:42.626 --> 52:44.494
Yeah, I'm gonna have to
clean this out for you.

52:44.494 --> 52:47.297
You're just stocking
this up with stuff

52:47.297 --> 52:49.933
you're never going to eat.
- I get it. I get it.

52:49.932 --> 52:50.900
You come in here,

52:50.900 --> 52:52.868
and you wanna rearrange my life.

52:52.869 --> 52:54.237
But you know what I really need?

52:54.237 --> 52:57.040
I need the script
rearranged, so I can sell it.

52:57.039 --> 52:58.541
♪ Space Cats ♪

52:58.541 --> 53:01.010
♪ Spa-a-a-a-Ce Cats ♪
- No!

53:01.010 --> 53:05.347
Every woman in your life wants
to rearrange things, huh?

53:05.347 --> 53:08.317
Well, we'll get to it
once the pizza gets here.

53:08.318 --> 53:12.589
But a functional kitchen
is key to functional life.

53:16.358 --> 53:17.359
Start there.

53:25.101 --> 53:27.871
And now, back
to the "Kartrashian's".

53:27.871 --> 53:30.073
Only on HLN,

53:30.072 --> 53:32.474
the Howard Lifestyle Network.

53:33.677 --> 53:35.212
I'm gonna die here.

53:35.211 --> 53:36.946
I'm gonna die here.

53:36.947 --> 53:41.351
I'm gonna die in a room
full of space kittens?

53:42.351 --> 53:44.620
Look,
that's me on TV!

53:44.621 --> 53:46.957
Reality TV is not TV.

53:46.956 --> 53:49.358
Oh, shut up, Howard.

53:49.358 --> 53:50.960
Can you believe it?

53:50.960 --> 53:53.696
Howie and I are on TV together.

53:53.697 --> 53:55.332
We're meant to be stars.

53:55.331 --> 53:57.600
Shut up,
you Kartrashian!

53:57.601 --> 53:58.435
Great!

53:58.434 --> 54:00.069
You're finally here.

54:00.070 --> 54:03.473
Oh, Howie, this is a
blessing in disguise.

54:03.472 --> 54:04.840
Selfie.

54:04.840 --> 54:06.775
You get signal up here?

54:06.775 --> 54:08.010
Just Instagram.

54:08.010 --> 54:09.078
Oh, Instagram.

54:09.079 --> 54:09.980
Wait a minute!

54:09.980 --> 54:11.715
Wait a minute!

54:11.715 --> 54:12.949
Who are you?

54:16.719 --> 54:18.587
Who the fuck are you?

54:18.588 --> 54:20.423
Oh, gosh, no.

54:20.422 --> 54:22.925
A Kartrashian, no.
- Ah, you are a fun one,

54:22.925 --> 54:24.360
aren't you?

54:24.360 --> 54:28.664
You know, Howard, it's
been a long time since I...

54:28.664 --> 54:30.132
No!

54:30.132 --> 54:31.400
This is definitely hell.

54:31.400 --> 54:32.768
This is hell.

54:32.768 --> 54:34.637
You are not in hell!

54:34.637 --> 54:35.938
Come on, Howard!

54:35.938 --> 54:37.406
Just the tip.

54:37.407 --> 54:38.775
Just the tip.
- So stupid.

54:40.710 --> 54:42.078
Wow.

54:42.077 --> 54:43.946
Oh my god.
- Hey, Phoenix?

54:43.947 --> 54:45.782
Huh?
- Phoenix?

54:45.782 --> 54:47.183
Hey, where's your remote?

54:47.182 --> 54:50.452
I'm trying to watch the
"Kardashians" when it comes on.

54:52.789 --> 54:55.125
Can we have a little talk?

54:56.659 --> 54:57.960
Where's your remote?

54:57.960 --> 54:59.061
It's right there.

54:59.061 --> 55:00.229
Oh.

55:00.230 --> 55:02.265
Thanks.

55:02.264 --> 55:03.198
Huh?

55:03.199 --> 55:04.668
What?

55:04.668 --> 55:08.038
Basically, I haven't seen
you go to work in three months,

55:08.038 --> 55:09.239
and I'm getting

55:09.239 --> 55:10.173
concerned about it.
- Yeah, that's-

55:10.172 --> 55:11.940
It's because I'm on call,

55:11.940 --> 55:13.108
and I have to wait

55:13.108 --> 55:14.610
for them to call me.
- On call?

55:14.610 --> 55:16.912
You work at a studio, and
you're dressed for work.

55:16.913 --> 55:18.148
Yeah, because I'm
- It's 10:15.

55:18.148 --> 55:19.582
waiting for them
to call me to go in.

55:19.581 --> 55:21.116
Get into work.

55:21.117 --> 55:21.951
What?

55:22.818 --> 55:24.620
I haven't been in three months,

55:24.621 --> 55:26.423
but-
- Well, let me

55:26.422 --> 55:28.090
get this straight. Hold on.
- Still send me checks.

55:28.090 --> 55:29.325
Hold on, hold on.

55:29.326 --> 55:30.760
What?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

55:30.760 --> 55:32.929
You haven't been to
work in three months,

55:32.929 --> 55:34.764
therefore, you haven't
pitched "Space Cats"?

55:34.764 --> 55:36.466
Have you ever spit "Space Cats"?

55:36.465 --> 55:37.299
What happened?

55:37.300 --> 55:38.802
It's dead.

55:38.802 --> 55:40.837
Yeah, I haven't been
to work in three months,

55:40.836 --> 55:42.638
because it's on the
bottom of the list

55:42.639 --> 55:45.775
of their priorities right now.

55:45.775 --> 55:47.277
So you're just
gonna have to wait.

55:47.277 --> 55:48.111
I'm sorry.

55:48.110 --> 55:49.078
The bottom?

55:49.079 --> 55:50.413
Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:50.413 --> 55:51.848
There's nothing I
can do about that.

55:51.847 --> 55:53.749
Hey, listen, we
have a good time.

55:53.750 --> 55:54.583
You're hot.

55:54.583 --> 55:55.517
I'm hot.

55:55.518 --> 55:57.020
We have a good time, right?

55:57.019 --> 55:58.921
But, like, you
don't pay any rent,

55:58.922 --> 56:02.459
and I need you to
pitch this show.

56:02.458 --> 56:04.493
"Space Cats" is just not
the priority right now,

56:04.494 --> 56:06.262
so get over it.

56:06.262 --> 56:08.498
Maybe write another script?

56:08.498 --> 56:10.333
I'm not getting over it.

56:10.333 --> 56:12.268
This is the thing,
this is my livelihood.

56:12.268 --> 56:13.737
This is my life.

56:13.737 --> 56:15.572
This is my life on the line.

56:15.572 --> 56:17.006
"Space Cats" is it.

56:17.005 --> 56:19.341
It's my ticket out of here.

56:19.342 --> 56:21.344
Look-
- Okay, well,

56:22.277 --> 56:24.546
I did what I could for it.

56:24.547 --> 56:26.049
So you're welcome.

56:27.449 --> 56:30.419
I mean, this is all
fine, and good, and great,

56:30.420 --> 56:31.688
and we have fun, right?

56:31.688 --> 56:32.756
Don't we have fun?

56:32.755 --> 56:34.123
Yeah, we do.

56:34.123 --> 56:35.290
So?
- Okay.

56:35.291 --> 56:36.826
So we have fun.
- What's the problem?

56:36.826 --> 56:38.361
We have fun,
- Yeah.

56:38.360 --> 56:40.262
but you don't pay any rent.

56:40.262 --> 56:42.131
You sit on this futon.

56:42.132 --> 56:43.967
You eat fuckin' chips.

56:45.101 --> 56:46.336
Guess what?

56:46.335 --> 56:47.169
This is-
- What?

56:47.170 --> 56:48.238
Today's your last day.

56:48.237 --> 56:49.605
Get out.

56:49.606 --> 56:51.408
You're such a dick!

56:51.407 --> 56:52.574
Why are you being like this?

56:52.574 --> 56:53.642
Oh, I'm the dick?

56:53.643 --> 56:54.844
Yeah.
- Why am I the dick?

56:54.844 --> 56:56.312
I read your stupid
script, Howard.

56:56.311 --> 56:57.479
It's all right.

56:57.480 --> 56:58.648
You can leave.

56:58.648 --> 56:59.582
Okay.
- Get your shit,

56:59.581 --> 57:00.582
and leave.
- I'll leave.

57:00.583 --> 57:01.251
I'll leave-
- Fuck you!

57:02.418 --> 57:04.586
Fuck you, you asshole!

57:04.586 --> 57:06.455
I'll leave when I'm ready

57:06.456 --> 57:07.824
after the "Kardashians".
- Oh, so I-

57:07.824 --> 57:09.659
I should go to-
- Bye, Howard.

57:09.659 --> 57:11.161
Go to your room, yeah.

57:11.161 --> 57:15.432
Do that, and I'll be gone
after the episode finishes.

57:20.869 --> 57:22.805
At least they had
their own show!

57:22.806 --> 57:24.474
Fuck you!

57:25.608 --> 57:28.344
And they're not sellouts.

57:28.344 --> 57:30.013
They are sellouts.

57:31.280 --> 57:33.282
Don't you have,
like, a boyfriend,

57:33.282 --> 57:34.950
like a big black rapper dude,

57:34.951 --> 57:36.186
and stuff like that?

57:36.186 --> 57:38.354
And like go, yeah, hang
out, blah, blah, blah,

57:38.353 --> 57:39.555
and stuff life that?

57:39.556 --> 57:41.257
I'm not that rapper dude.

57:41.257 --> 57:42.759
Oh, you are.

57:42.759 --> 57:43.827
I am?

57:43.827 --> 57:45.328
Hmm.
- From the waist down.

57:45.327 --> 57:46.361
Oh!

57:46.362 --> 57:47.363
Thank you.

57:47.362 --> 57:48.197
JK.

57:49.699 --> 57:51.301
And take a beep
whenever you're ready. Action.

57:51.300 --> 57:52.568
Hi, my name is Alexis,

57:52.568 --> 57:55.337
and I'm reading for
the role of Fleaowe.

57:55.338 --> 57:56.573
And I'm Howard.

57:56.572 --> 57:57.639
I'm the screenwriter.

57:57.639 --> 57:58.841
Hey.
- I'll be reading

57:58.842 --> 57:59.509
with you today.
- Nice to meet you.

57:59.509 --> 58:00.743
What is...

58:00.742 --> 58:01.477
Can everybody turn
their phone off?

58:01.478 --> 58:02.011
Thanks.
- Yeah.

58:02.010 --> 58:03.445
Sorry.

58:03.445 --> 58:04.947
Was that your phone?
- It might have been, sorry.

58:04.947 --> 58:05.914
And you went green?

58:05.914 --> 58:06.849
Is that...

58:06.849 --> 58:07.816
Is this why-
- Yeah,

58:07.817 --> 58:08.952
I just figured
- I'm doin' the

58:08.952 --> 58:10.119
green thing.
- it would be better

58:10.119 --> 58:11.287
than having a script.
- I'm doing the

58:11.286 --> 58:12.521
green thing also.
- Oh, okay.

58:12.521 --> 58:13.455
Awesome.
- Can you see how I like-

58:13.456 --> 58:14.657
I like it.

58:14.657 --> 58:15.458
Ed Begley told
me don't use paper.

58:15.458 --> 58:16.259
Mm-hmm.

58:16.259 --> 58:17.393
Okay, go .

58:17.393 --> 58:18.561
We'd love to hear you do.

58:18.561 --> 58:19.395
Let's go.

58:19.394 --> 58:20.696
Okay.

58:20.697 --> 58:24.634
Interior
captain's quarters, day.

58:24.634 --> 58:25.768
"Floaowe?"

58:25.768 --> 58:27.971
"Commander, what is it?"

58:30.306 --> 58:31.241
"Oh no!"

58:31.240 --> 58:33.609
"It's a bird, it's a plan?"

58:33.610 --> 58:35.178
"It's a plan", that's correct.

58:35.177 --> 58:36.345
Okay.
- Yeah.

58:37.246 --> 58:39.181
"It's a space kitty?"

58:39.181 --> 58:41.917
Mm-hmm.
- A space kitty?

58:41.918 --> 58:44.487
"No, computer,
how do you frost a cake?"

58:44.487 --> 58:46.890
"Commander, I know
how to frost a cake."

58:46.889 --> 58:48.957
You're supposed to say it
like, I just wanna frost a cake.

58:48.958 --> 58:50.894
Give me like a Marilyn Monroe,

58:50.893 --> 58:52.194
like a -
- Sorry,

58:52.195 --> 58:53.930
I don't really feel
comfortable with that.

58:53.929 --> 58:54.930
It's a little too seductive.
- Okay, do that

58:54.931 --> 58:55.765
however you want.

58:55.764 --> 58:57.733
Okay.
- Okay.

58:57.733 --> 58:59.468
"Voice print confirmed."

58:59.469 --> 59:00.803
"Stop showing off, Fleaowe!"

59:00.802 --> 59:03.572
"In the future,
which we're in now,

59:03.572 --> 59:06.575
computers are
superior to women."

59:06.576 --> 59:07.544
"Sorry, Commander,

59:07.543 --> 59:08.744
but do remember,

59:08.744 --> 59:11.013
I was in the deep freeze
for over 100 years."

59:11.014 --> 59:12.382
"I forgive you this time."

59:12.382 --> 59:14.284
"So what's your objective?"

59:14.284 --> 59:15.518
"My objective?"

59:15.518 --> 59:17.020
"Right!"

59:17.019 --> 59:20.656
"It's to rescue all of the
spacey, baby space cats,

59:22.157 --> 59:26.194
and bring them safely
home to Space Station 4?"

59:26.195 --> 59:27.530
"You mean 5?"

59:27.530 --> 59:28.831
"Right, 5."

59:28.831 --> 59:29.966
"Okay,
good, excellent."

59:29.965 --> 59:31.967
"And?"
- "And I'm here to serve

59:31.967 --> 59:34.102
all of my Commander's needs."

59:34.103 --> 59:35.204
Breathy.

59:35.204 --> 59:36.039
Okay.
- Breathy,

59:36.039 --> 59:36.973
and I'm here to serve.

59:36.972 --> 59:38.073
I'm here to...

59:38.074 --> 59:39.042
I'm here-
- I'm here to serve?

59:39.041 --> 59:40.309
Can I just try it the way

59:40.309 --> 59:41.510
that I feel comfortable?
- I'm here to serve.

59:41.510 --> 59:43.445
I'm sorry, I just
don't like that at all,

59:43.445 --> 59:44.746
and I just don't
feel comfortable

59:44.746 --> 59:45.581
doing that, so.
- No, but you're

59:45.581 --> 59:46.982
an actor, right?

59:46.983 --> 59:48.217
"I'm here to serve

59:48.217 --> 59:49.886
all of my Commander's
needs this mission."

59:49.885 --> 59:50.886
That's it?

59:51.853 --> 59:53.388
"And physical, if necessary."

59:53.389 --> 59:56.326
I'm sorry, that was not
in the sides I received.

59:56.326 --> 59:57.527
Okay.

59:57.527 --> 59:58.361
We added that.

59:58.360 --> 59:59.194
Okay.

59:59.195 --> 01:00:00.029
Right.

01:00:00.028 --> 01:00:01.263
"Remember, Fleaowe,

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:01.931
We have plenty"-
- You added that?

01:00:01.931 --> 01:00:02.599
Who added that?

01:00:02.599 --> 01:00:03.466
That's awful.

01:00:03.465 --> 01:00:04.399
Okay.

01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:07.403
So nevermind who added that.

01:00:07.402 --> 01:00:08.837
"Battle stations!"

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.673
"But Commander, I
don't have my spacesuit."

01:00:10.672 --> 01:00:13.375
"It's all the way in my
chamber in Level Deck 4."

01:00:13.376 --> 01:00:15.111
Okay, now you

01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.214
Yeah, go ahead.

01:00:18.213 --> 01:00:19.147
Read it again.

01:00:19.148 --> 01:00:20.483
"I don't have my spacesuit."

01:00:20.483 --> 01:00:22.719
"It's in my chamber
on Level Deck 4."

01:00:22.719 --> 01:00:24.954
"Here, here!"

01:00:24.954 --> 01:00:26.956
We'll, put this on.

01:00:26.956 --> 01:00:29.192
Privacy, please,
so I can change.

01:00:29.192 --> 01:00:31.094
Yeah,
I'll turn around.

01:00:31.094 --> 01:00:32.261
You know what?

01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.662
I'm just... No, I
don't like this at all.

01:00:33.663 --> 01:00:34.931
Yeah, can
you pick a costume?

01:00:34.931 --> 01:00:36.065
I'm not feeling

01:00:36.065 --> 01:00:37.300
comfortable with-
- No, but-

01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:38.267
Are you even
the screen writer?

01:00:38.266 --> 01:00:39.368
Like the stuff that you're

01:00:39.369 --> 01:00:40.203
including in this
- No-

01:00:40.202 --> 01:00:41.937
is so inappropriate.

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:43.940
Why is it inappropriate?
- I think I need to-

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.375
No, excuse me.

01:00:45.375 --> 01:00:46.743
I'm sorry, here.
- Why is it inappropriate

01:00:46.742 --> 01:00:48.276
for you to put on a costume?
- I'm so sorry.

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:49.545
I am not going to do this.
- Actors wear costumes.

01:00:49.545 --> 01:00:51.014
I'm reporting you to
the Labor Law Board.

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:52.348
This is unacceptable.
- Labor Law?

01:00:52.347 --> 01:00:53.582
Howard?

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.118
Howard, just-
- I'll put it on.

01:00:55.117 --> 01:00:56.051
You fuckin' assholes.

01:00:57.019 --> 01:00:58.286
Okay.

01:00:58.286 --> 01:00:59.254
Okay.

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:01.924
So thanks for coming back in.

01:01:01.923 --> 01:01:03.625
I'm sorry I said all that stuff.

01:01:03.626 --> 01:01:04.894
Okay.

01:01:04.893 --> 01:01:07.129
I didn't mean
any of that stuff, okay?

01:01:07.130 --> 01:01:09.899
You know, we wanna
get you this role.

01:01:09.898 --> 01:01:11.066
So I'm sorry.

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:12.535
Okay.
- I'm sorry I did that. Okay?

01:01:12.534 --> 01:01:14.036
So let's just take it
from "Battle stations",

01:01:14.036 --> 01:01:14.870
'cause I like you.

01:01:14.871 --> 01:01:16.072
I like you.

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.173
So let's take it from
"Battle station".

01:01:17.172 --> 01:01:18.874
Are you married, by the way?

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:20.409
Howard.
- Why is that relevant?

01:01:20.409 --> 01:01:23.745
Well, you're
wearing like a thousand rings.

01:01:23.746 --> 01:01:25.948
It really has
nothing to do with you,

01:01:25.947 --> 01:01:27.115
and so I really don't
- I'm just curious.

01:01:27.115 --> 01:01:28.150
wanna talk about it.
- It's rapport.

01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:29.484
I think that's not...

01:01:29.485 --> 01:01:30.553
It just doesn't matter.
- I just wanna know-

01:01:30.552 --> 01:01:31.787
I wanna-
- It doesn't matter

01:01:31.788 --> 01:01:32.955
It doesn't matter
if I'm married.

01:01:32.954 --> 01:01:33.755
Huh?
- Get to the lines, Howard.

01:01:33.755 --> 01:01:34.423
Oh, okay.

01:01:34.423 --> 01:01:35.657
All right.

01:01:35.657 --> 01:01:36.625
I'm just trying
to create rapport.

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:37.427
Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:38.227
So let's take it from...

01:01:38.226 --> 01:01:39.394
Let's take it from...

01:01:39.394 --> 01:01:40.796
But you're married,
though, right?

01:01:40.797 --> 01:01:41.931
Oh, Jesus, Howard.
- Are you serious right now?

01:01:41.931 --> 01:01:43.733
Jesus Christ.
- Let's take it from...

01:01:43.733 --> 01:01:45.034
Forget I said that.

01:01:45.034 --> 01:01:46.302
Forget I said that.
- So if I'm married

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:47.837
does that mean that I'm
not getting this role,

01:01:47.836 --> 01:01:49.271
'cause you want me to do
things that I wouldn't do

01:01:49.271 --> 01:01:50.472
if I was married?
- No, forget I said that.

01:01:50.472 --> 01:01:51.306
That was stupid.

01:01:51.306 --> 01:01:52.274
Okay.

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:53.109
Nevermind.

01:01:53.108 --> 01:01:53.942
Okay.

01:01:53.943 --> 01:01:55.611
"It's a type of..."

01:01:55.610 --> 01:01:56.678
"It's a type of cat attack."

01:01:56.679 --> 01:01:58.648
"Battle stations!"

01:02:00.349 --> 01:02:01.284
"I'm sorry, Commander."

01:02:01.284 --> 01:02:02.618
"I don't have my spacesuit."

01:02:02.617 --> 01:02:04.986
"It's all the way in my
bed chamber in Level 4."

01:02:04.987 --> 01:02:06.989
She's angry.

01:02:06.989 --> 01:02:08.725
It's like...

01:02:08.724 --> 01:02:09.725
Howard.
- Yeah?

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:10.827
No, okay.
- I just-

01:02:10.827 --> 01:02:11.761
All right.

01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:13.028
All right, it's okay, it's okay.

01:02:13.028 --> 01:02:14.062
I'm a professional.

01:02:14.063 --> 01:02:14.897
Here we go.

01:02:14.896 --> 01:02:16.264
I'll find my spot again.

01:02:16.264 --> 01:02:17.599
Okay.
- and here we go.

01:02:17.599 --> 01:02:18.800
Say that again.

01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:20.368
It's all the way in your...

01:02:20.369 --> 01:02:22.672
"In my chambers on Level 4."

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:23.973
"Right."

01:02:23.972 --> 01:02:26.208
"Well, there's no time."

01:02:26.208 --> 01:02:28.176
"Put this on."

01:02:28.177 --> 01:02:29.512
Oh, shoot.

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:30.813
"Put this on."

01:02:30.813 --> 01:02:32.248
Oh, crap.

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:33.850
Oh, put this on.

01:02:35.016 --> 01:02:35.984
Okay.

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:37.353
Privacy, please.

01:02:37.353 --> 01:02:38.755
The camera's gonna get this?

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.056
Okay, so I'll turn around

01:02:40.056 --> 01:02:42.759
while you put on that spacesuit.

01:02:42.759 --> 01:02:44.360
While you put on that...

01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:45.595
Okay, it's on.
- Is she doing it?

01:02:45.594 --> 01:02:46.795
Yeah, she's doing it.
- Is she putting it...

01:02:46.795 --> 01:02:47.829
Did you put it-

01:02:47.829 --> 01:02:48.497
Did it-
- Can we just pretend

01:02:48.498 --> 01:02:49.632
I put it on?

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:50.700
Okay, fine.

01:02:51.934 --> 01:02:53.903
Fine.

01:02:53.902 --> 01:02:54.703
Okay then.

01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.573
Ahoy then.

01:02:57.572 --> 01:02:58.807
Ahoy.

01:02:58.807 --> 01:02:59.641
She doesn't have
the spacesuit,

01:02:59.641 --> 01:03:01.076
and that doesn't work.

01:03:01.077 --> 01:03:02.178
Howard,
- It doesn't work.

01:03:02.177 --> 01:03:03.111
it's an addition.
- I can't.

01:03:03.112 --> 01:03:03.780
I am so sorry.

01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:04.614
I just...

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:05.982
Howard, can we talk?

01:03:05.981 --> 01:03:06.815
If you don't mind waiting?

01:03:06.815 --> 01:03:07.649
I can't.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:08.785
I can't.

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:09.985
It seems like she just-
- Howard, don't.

01:03:09.985 --> 01:03:10.786
Stay back here.
- She's just drapes-

01:03:10.786 --> 01:03:11.887
She just drapes it

01:03:11.887 --> 01:03:12.854
over her arm.
- Thank you for coming.

01:03:12.855 --> 01:03:13.790
I'm so sorry.
- You know what?

01:03:13.789 --> 01:03:14.756
Howard.
- This is her!

01:03:14.757 --> 01:03:15.558
This is her!

01:03:15.557 --> 01:03:16.491
I'll still try it.

01:03:16.492 --> 01:03:17.693
I'm gonna try-
- Howard!

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:18.494
I'm gonna try it.
- You are being

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:19.862
so unprofessional,

01:03:19.862 --> 01:03:20.797
unprofessional right now.
- No, I'm sorry.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:21.898
I've never had an experience

01:03:21.898 --> 01:03:23.065
like this before
- Yes.

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:24.200
at any audition.
- Well, now-

01:03:24.199 --> 01:03:24.933
Now, I'm-
- Are you actually

01:03:24.934 --> 01:03:26.269
a screenwriter?

01:03:26.268 --> 01:03:27.202
Yeah, I'm-

01:03:27.202 --> 01:03:28.837

01:03:28.838 --> 01:03:29.705
Well, what's...

01:03:29.704 --> 01:03:30.505
Look-
- I feel like

01:03:30.505 --> 01:03:31.606
I need to report you

01:03:31.606 --> 01:03:33.008
to the Labor Law Board.
- Doesn't it-

01:03:33.009 --> 01:03:35.011
No, but seriously-
- This is so unacceptable.

01:03:35.010 --> 01:03:37.112
Doesn't an actor
like say the lines

01:03:37.112 --> 01:03:38.079

- Howard!

01:03:39.514 --> 01:03:41.016
Am I missing something?

01:03:41.016 --> 01:03:43.518
You keep
hitting on the talent, so.

01:03:43.518 --> 01:03:45.453
Oh, I keep hitting
on the talent?

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:46.289

- And this is

01:11:24.979 --> 01:11:26.014
gonna be great, okay?
- No.

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:27.816
You're in a spacesuit.

01:11:27.815 --> 01:11:28.916
I like it.
- Yeah.

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:29.852
Did you bring your-
- You know,

01:11:29.851 --> 01:11:31.019
I just had it in my closet.

01:11:31.020 --> 01:11:32.554
Oh.
- Did you bring your sides?

01:11:32.554 --> 01:11:33.856
She had it in her closet.
- Oh, it's all in my brain.

01:11:33.855 --> 01:11:34.789
It's all...

01:11:34.789 --> 01:11:35.757
'Cause you don't need this?

01:11:35.757 --> 01:11:36.557
'Cause-
- No, no.

01:11:36.557 --> 01:11:37.759
Yeah, okay.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:38.627
I don't even
use sides anymore.

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:39.461
Okay.

01:11:39.461 --> 01:11:40.396
All right.

01:11:40.395 --> 01:11:41.129
Let's do it.
- Okay.

01:11:41.130 --> 01:11:42.398
So let's slate.

01:11:43.798 --> 01:11:46.434
So you'll say your name, look
into camera A right here,

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:47.403
Okay.

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:48.971
and then you'll say

01:11:48.970 --> 01:11:50.204
what character you're playing,

01:11:50.204 --> 01:11:51.439
and then we'll jump
into the scene.

01:11:51.439 --> 01:11:53.574
Yeah.
- So whenever you're ready.

01:11:53.574 --> 01:11:55.109
Hi, my name is Victoria,

01:11:55.109 --> 01:11:58.146
and I am playing
the role of Fleaowe.

01:12:00.114 --> 01:12:00.915
Okay.

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:01.684
You aced that one.

01:12:01.684 --> 01:12:02.751
That's good.

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:03.952
Okay.

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:07.256
Interior captain's
quarters, day.

01:12:07.256 --> 01:12:08.190
"Fleaowe!"

01:12:08.189 --> 01:12:10.091
"Captain, what is it?"

01:12:10.091 --> 01:12:11.592
"Oh, it's a bird."

01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:15.864
"It's a plane."

01:12:15.863 --> 01:12:17.598
"Oh, no, it's a space kitty."

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:20.969
"Oh, no, wait,
it's just an asteroid."

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:24.106
"No, Computer, how
do you frost a cake?"

01:12:24.105 --> 01:12:26.107
"Commander, I know
how to frost a cake."

01:12:26.108 --> 01:12:27.676
"Voice print confirmed."

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.311
"Stop showing off, Fleaowe!"

01:12:29.310 --> 01:12:32.347
"In the future,
which we're in now,

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:35.083
computers are
superior to women."

01:12:35.083 --> 01:12:37.185
"Oh, sorry, Commander."

01:12:37.185 --> 01:12:41.055
"But remember, I was in the
deep freeze for over 100 years."

01:12:41.055 --> 01:12:44.525
"Well, damn, Fleaowe,
I will not fail you."

01:12:44.525 --> 01:12:45.560
"Forgive me this time."

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:47.562
"So what's your objective?"

01:12:47.563 --> 01:12:48.630
"My objective?"

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:49.865
Right!"

01:12:49.864 --> 01:12:52.800
"It's to rescue all
the space kitties,

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:56.705
and bring them back to space..."

01:12:58.239 --> 01:12:59.507
I'm sorry, I'm gonna
do that again, okay?

01:12:59.507 --> 01:13:00.908
Oh, of
course, go for it.

01:13:00.908 --> 01:13:03.177
Take a beep whenever
you're ready.

01:13:03.177 --> 01:13:04.011
To...

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:07.216
"My objective, right."

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:10.986
"It's to rescue all
of the space kitties,

01:13:10.985 --> 01:13:14.021
and bring them home to
Station Number Four."

01:13:14.021 --> 01:13:15.690
"You mean, five."

01:13:15.690 --> 01:13:17.759
"Scratching Post
Number Five, yes."

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:19.762
"Okay, good, excellent."

01:13:19.761 --> 01:13:21.396
"And?"

01:13:21.396 --> 01:13:24.899
"And to serve all
of my Commander's
needs in this mission,

01:13:24.899 --> 01:13:26.534
physical, if necessary."

01:13:28.002 --> 01:13:29.437
"Right, Fleaowe."

01:13:29.438 --> 01:13:34.176
"And, you know, we'll have
plenty of downtime on the ship,

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:37.780
and I promise you, I
personally promise you,

01:13:37.779 --> 01:13:42.116
that you will get a big
promotion after the rescue."

01:13:54.563 --> 01:13:57.065
"Commander, look at
this Alpha Screen!"

01:13:57.064 --> 01:13:58.499
"We have a cataract."

01:13:58.500 --> 01:13:59.467
"What is that?"

01:13:59.467 --> 01:14:01.335
"It's a type of cat attack."

01:14:01.336 --> 01:14:02.571
"Battle Stations!"

01:14:02.570 --> 01:14:04.505
"Commander, I don't
have my spacesuit."

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.674
"That's okay, Fleaowe."

01:14:06.675 --> 01:14:09.411
"I mean, what you
have on is fine,

01:14:11.447 --> 01:14:15.017
unless you wanna change into
something more comfortable."

01:14:15.016 --> 01:14:16.784
Commander.

01:14:16.784 --> 01:14:20.955
"Computer, give her
another spacesuit."

01:14:20.956 --> 01:14:22.624
"Another spacesuit."

01:14:24.893 --> 01:14:27.196
Do you want me to change?

01:14:27.195 --> 01:14:30.565
No,  so you
already have the suit on.

01:14:30.565 --> 01:14:32.099
Okay, so....
- Just move on.

01:14:32.100 --> 01:14:33.402
I thought that was great.

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:34.636
I thought it was terrific.
- You know,

01:14:34.636 --> 01:14:35.871
I've been practicing.
- That was terrific.

01:14:35.871 --> 01:14:37.306
It was like the
magic technique

01:14:37.305 --> 01:14:39.073
that I've been really
practicing for a long time.

01:14:39.073 --> 01:14:40.274
And guess what?
- I don't know why.

01:14:40.274 --> 01:14:41.442
They're fine.
- I felt like

01:14:41.443 --> 01:14:42.444
I was channeling
- You were wonderful.

01:14:42.444 --> 01:14:43.545
like a space person.

01:14:43.545 --> 01:14:44.480
Yeah.
- You know,

01:14:44.479 --> 01:14:45.613
like that Neil Strongarm.

01:14:45.613 --> 01:14:46.848
Like, he's so good.

01:14:46.849 --> 01:14:47.916
Neil Armstrong.
- That was perfect.

01:14:47.916 --> 01:14:49.017
I just felt like I was him.

01:14:49.016 --> 01:14:50.284
Yeah.

01:14:50.284 --> 01:14:51.986
I felt like you really
were like part of NASA.

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:53.288
Thank you for inviting me.

01:14:53.287 --> 01:14:54.355
Thank you for inviting me.
- Of course.

01:14:54.355 --> 01:14:56.190
That was-
- Can we like

01:14:56.190 --> 01:14:57.658
Very well done.
- try another one?

01:14:57.658 --> 01:14:58.793
I mean, like-
- Yeah.

01:14:58.793 --> 01:14:59.961
Do you guys-
- That was perfect,

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:02.064
but can we try another?
- It was perfect.

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:03.232
Okay, let's see.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:05.400
" Voice print confirmed."

01:15:05.399 --> 01:15:07.935
"Stop showing off, Fleaowe."

01:15:07.935 --> 01:15:11.405
"In the future,
which we're in now,

01:15:11.405 --> 01:15:13.908
computers are
superior to women."

01:15:13.908 --> 01:15:15.676
"Sorry, Commander."

01:15:17.078 --> 01:15:20.882
"Remember, I was in deep
freeze for over 100 years."

01:15:20.882 --> 01:15:24.018
"Damn, well, Fleaowe,
I will not fail you."

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:25.020
"Forgive me this time."

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.788
"So what's your objective?"

01:15:26.787 --> 01:15:28.723
"My objective, right."

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:30.459
"It's to..."

01:15:30.458 --> 01:15:31.859
Sit up straight.

01:15:31.859 --> 01:15:35.263
"To rescue all of
the space kitties,

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:39.468
and bring them back home to
Scratching Post Number Four."

01:15:39.467 --> 01:15:41.302
"You mean, five?"

01:15:41.302 --> 01:15:42.803
"Right."

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:44.573
Look, see her arms not
in the cast, so she can...

01:15:44.573 --> 01:15:45.407
"Right."

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:46.275
"Good, excellent."

01:15:46.274 --> 01:15:47.108
"And?"

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:51.146
"And to serve my
Commander's needs

01:15:51.145 --> 01:15:53.281
for all of this mission."

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:55.851
Stop.

01:15:55.850 --> 01:15:57.084
Let me
do that one again.

01:15:57.886 --> 01:15:58.887
Of course.

01:15:58.886 --> 01:15:59.754
It's okay.

01:15:59.755 --> 01:16:00.622
Okay.
- Ask me again.

01:16:00.622 --> 01:16:02.057
Okay.

01:16:02.056 --> 01:16:05.159
"That's good,
excellent", Victoria.

01:16:05.159 --> 01:16:06.394
"And?"

01:16:06.395 --> 01:16:08.797
"And to serve all of
my Commander's needs

01:16:08.796 --> 01:16:10.164
for this mission,

01:16:10.164 --> 01:16:11.032
and physical too."

01:16:11.033 --> 01:16:11.867
Stop!

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:14.403
Stop.
- You're making me laugh now.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:15.237
Come on.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:18.273
It's okay.
- See, we got...

01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:19.274
It's chemistry.

01:16:19.274 --> 01:16:20.509
All right.
- Howard,

01:16:20.509 --> 01:16:21.743
let's go back from
that last line.

01:16:21.743 --> 01:16:22.544
Let's just get this take.
- Okay.

01:16:22.543 --> 01:16:23.744
Okay, let's just do

01:16:23.744 --> 01:16:24.412
the last one.

01:16:25.380 --> 01:16:26.548
"Ahoy."
- "Ahoy."

01:16:26.547 --> 01:16:27.615
"Ahoy."

01:16:27.615 --> 01:16:28.749
Stop making me laugh.

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:31.286
She's just too funny.
- Ahoy, ahoy.

01:16:31.286 --> 01:16:33.388
Ahoy, ahoy, ahoy.
- Stop it.

01:16:33.387 --> 01:16:35.489
You guys are so great.

01:16:35.489 --> 01:16:36.724
I'm just so happy

01:16:36.725 --> 01:16:37.392
you read everything.
- Isn't she brilliant?

01:16:37.391 --> 01:16:38.626
Like, she's...

01:16:38.627 --> 01:16:40.395
I mean, look, she
was on Broadway.

01:16:40.395 --> 01:16:41.697
I was and the Tony's.

01:16:41.697 --> 01:16:43.031
Tell them.

01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:44.198
Tell them about-
- I mean, one or two Tony's.

01:16:44.198 --> 01:16:45.066
Give them a
little like rundown.

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:46.435
Two?
- Two Tony's,

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:47.669
and I'm gonna open

01:16:47.668 --> 01:16:49.036
my own school of the
Meisner Technique,

01:16:49.037 --> 01:16:50.005
and I'm gonna...

01:16:50.005 --> 01:16:50.939
It's been
- What?

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:52.007
just a wonderful journey,

01:16:52.006 --> 01:16:53.374
you know, the actor's journey,

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:54.776
Yeah.
- just being grounded

01:16:54.775 --> 01:16:57.011
Yeah.
- with all of these characters

01:16:57.011 --> 01:16:58.179
that you write.

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.848
And didn't you win the Obie?

01:16:59.847 --> 01:17:02.216
I did, I did that-
- That OBGYB.

01:17:02.216 --> 01:17:03.584
Yeah, well...

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:06.188
Howard.

01:17:06.188 --> 01:17:08.557
Yeah, so I hope you cast me,

01:17:08.556 --> 01:17:10.324
and-
- She was...

01:17:10.324 --> 01:17:11.659
We got it, right?

01:17:11.659 --> 01:17:12.493
We could do this.

01:17:12.493 --> 01:17:13.628
I mean,

01:17:13.628 --> 01:17:14.729
you're the screenwriter.
- It's actually-

01:17:14.729 --> 01:17:16.230
Do you want-
- You wanna do a twirl?

01:17:16.230 --> 01:17:17.565
Wanna give her the part?

01:17:17.565 --> 01:17:18.666
Can you do it in your seat,

01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:19.635
like a little twirl?
- Well...

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:20.869
Can you twirl in your seat?

01:17:20.868 --> 01:17:22.203
Oh, you know I can twirl.

01:17:22.203 --> 01:17:23.404
Or twerk,

01:17:23.404 --> 01:17:25.106
or what are they saying?
- Oh, no, not twerk.

01:17:25.106 --> 01:17:25.940
Because-
- You know,

01:17:25.940 --> 01:17:27.341
I had a surgery on my...

01:17:27.341 --> 01:17:28.476
Yeah.

01:17:28.476 --> 01:17:29.744
Like, you know,

01:17:29.744 --> 01:17:30.945
if you want this role,
you gotta let me know,

01:17:30.945 --> 01:17:32.046
okay?
- Yeah, of course.

01:17:32.046 --> 01:17:33.214
I mean, I'm-
- I mean, if you want-

01:17:33.215 --> 01:17:34.116
I mean, this is gonna
be like a big...

01:17:34.115 --> 01:17:35.549
This is a big movie.

01:17:35.550 --> 01:17:36.685
I'm available,
Howard, you know that.

01:17:36.685 --> 01:17:37.686
You're available?

01:17:37.685 --> 01:17:38.919
I'm available.
- That's what I

01:17:38.920 --> 01:17:40.922
like about you,
you're available.

01:17:40.921 --> 01:17:42.690
Okay.
- Whenever you call.

01:17:42.690 --> 01:17:44.392
Okay, so...

01:17:44.393 --> 01:17:45.961
Oh, she's back.

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:47.095
Howard, I think-
- So it wasn't...

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:48.330
She was great, right?

01:17:48.329 --> 01:17:49.997
She was amazing.

01:17:49.997 --> 01:17:52.466
So next step is going to be...

01:17:52.466 --> 01:17:53.734
Oh, Howard, maybe we should have

01:17:53.734 --> 01:17:55.302
another separate
meeting about this?

01:17:55.302 --> 01:17:57.538
Go over the-
- You know, I think she

01:17:57.538 --> 01:17:58.873
Oh!
- basically just crushed it.

01:17:58.873 --> 01:17:59.707
Okay.

01:17:59.707 --> 01:18:00.608
No, of course she did.

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:02.044
She crushed it.

01:18:02.043 --> 01:18:03.010
So...

01:18:03.011 --> 01:18:04.246
But I'm saying,

01:18:04.246 --> 01:18:05.647
Howard, I think
as the producers,

01:18:05.646 --> 01:18:07.448
we should go talk
like off camera.

01:18:07.448 --> 01:18:08.282
Well, we...

01:18:08.283 --> 01:18:09.284
Yeah, we'll...

01:18:09.283 --> 01:18:11.752
But you have her
headshot, right?

01:18:11.752 --> 01:18:13.320
Yes, we have her info.

01:18:13.320 --> 01:18:14.321
Uh-huh, that's my job.

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:15.824
You're saying that

01:18:15.823 --> 01:18:16.557
you're eligible, right?

01:18:16.557 --> 01:18:17.625
Okay.
- Yeah.

01:18:17.626 --> 01:18:18.293
Yeah.
- You're eligible?

01:18:18.292 --> 01:18:19.093
You know.

01:18:19.094 --> 01:18:20.295
I mean, Tony awards.

01:18:20.295 --> 01:18:21.430
Remember, I told you.

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:22.364
Yeah.

01:18:22.363 --> 01:18:23.831
I'm all set.

01:18:23.832 --> 01:18:24.833
I'm not gonna check, so-
- Yes, here they are.

01:18:26.301 --> 01:18:27.602
Anyway, I'm gonna walk
you... You wanna have lunch?

01:18:27.601 --> 01:18:28.703
Yeah, sure.
- Okay.

01:18:28.703 --> 01:18:30.204
Yeah.
- So let's do it.

01:18:30.204 --> 01:18:31.439
Let's go.

01:18:31.439 --> 01:18:32.106
Let's pretend

01:18:32.106 --> 01:18:32.907
we just married.

01:18:32.908 --> 01:18:33.575
Nice to meet you.

01:18:37.746 --> 01:18:39.581
You're so silly Howard!

01:18:39.581 --> 01:18:40.682
We don't have...

01:18:40.681 --> 01:18:41.682
Nice to meet you.

01:18:41.682 --> 01:18:43.017
That's silly.

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:44.553
We didn't know each other

01:18:44.552 --> 01:18:45.686
before this thing.
- But we get each other

01:18:45.686 --> 01:18:46.520
for so long, Howard.

01:18:47.922 --> 01:18:48.989
Let me show you the door.
- Yeah.

01:18:48.989 --> 01:18:49.824
Yeah.

01:18:49.824 --> 01:18:50.991
Howard,

01:18:50.992 --> 01:18:51.927
What?
- are we meeting after lunch,

01:18:51.926 --> 01:18:53.127
or tomorrow, or-
- No, after.

01:18:53.127 --> 01:18:54.762
After.
- After?

01:18:54.762 --> 01:18:56.430
Oh.
- I was saying after.

01:18:56.430 --> 01:18:57.531
That's what she said.

01:18:57.532 --> 01:18:58.233
Okay.

01:18:58.233 --> 01:18:59.234
Saying after.

01:18:59.234 --> 01:19:00.035
He's leaving.

01:19:00.034 --> 01:19:01.235
Y'all, well, thank you

01:19:01.235 --> 01:19:02.470
for having me.
- You never know.

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:03.170
Yeah, thank you
for being here.

01:19:03.171 --> 01:19:03.972
Howard?
- Bye.

01:19:03.971 --> 01:19:05.005
Goddammit!

01:19:05.006 --> 01:19:06.975
Finally, "Space Cats".

01:19:06.975 --> 01:19:08.210
My own studio.

01:19:09.043 --> 01:19:10.177
I can pinch myself.

01:19:10.177 --> 01:19:11.011
Ow.

01:19:11.011 --> 01:19:11.946
I can pinch myself.

01:19:11.947 --> 01:19:13.448
It's my dream.

01:19:14.783 --> 01:19:15.617
Great.

01:19:15.617 --> 01:19:17.119
You're here early.

01:19:20.322 --> 01:19:21.790
Phoenix, what
are you doing here?

01:19:21.789 --> 01:19:23.991
Didn't I throw you
out of my apartment?

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:25.193
Yeah, yeah.

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:27.429
It's good to see
you too, Howard.

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:30.198
Jesus, a thank
you would be nice.

01:19:30.198 --> 01:19:31.066
A thank you?

01:19:31.065 --> 01:19:33.501
You sold "Space Cats"?

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:34.936
"Baby Space Cats".

01:19:34.935 --> 01:19:36.804
The studio exec changed it.

01:19:36.805 --> 01:19:38.206
"Baby Space Cats"?

01:19:38.206 --> 01:19:39.708
Well, you sold it, right?

01:19:39.707 --> 01:19:41.108
That's what's important.

01:19:41.109 --> 01:19:41.943
Come here.

01:19:41.943 --> 01:19:42.778
I owe you an apology.

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:43.745
Oh, oh!

01:19:43.744 --> 01:19:46.013
You owe me a lot more than that.

01:19:46.014 --> 01:19:48.216
We own "Baby Space Cats".

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:50.285
We both own "Baby Space Cats"?

01:19:50.284 --> 01:19:51.485
That's great.

01:19:51.485 --> 01:19:52.553
The studio.

01:19:52.554 --> 01:19:53.955
The studio owns it.

01:19:53.954 --> 01:19:55.189
Fuck me!

01:19:55.189 --> 01:19:56.190
Oh, I did.

01:19:57.626 --> 01:20:01.296
And now, I'm moving back
into your apartment again.

01:20:02.863 --> 01:20:04.265
I'm pregnant.

01:20:04.265 --> 01:20:07.668
Bee-boop.

01:20:07.668 --> 01:20:09.870
Latex allergies!

01:20:09.871 --> 01:20:13.809
Got that right.

01:20:14.775 --> 01:20:17.645
Gotta wrap it up, Howard.

01:20:18.613 --> 01:20:23.552
♪ Howard, Howard, Howard ♪

01:20:24.185 --> 01:20:25.719
♪ Howard ♪

01:20:26.854 --> 01:20:28.455
Blue?

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:31.893
Blue?

01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:34.195
Blue?

01:20:35.229 --> 01:20:36.664
Where is that darn cat?

01:20:36.664 --> 01:20:37.832
Where is she?

01:20:37.832 --> 01:20:38.799
Blue?

01:20:38.800 --> 01:20:41.236
Finally, you woke.

01:20:41.235 --> 01:20:43.971
Trying to drink
myself to death.

01:20:43.971 --> 01:20:46.674
Hello?

01:20:46.675 --> 01:20:47.809
Who the fuck are you?

01:20:51.313 --> 01:20:52.280
Where are my toys?

01:20:52.279 --> 01:20:53.848
And how'd you get in here?

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:56.818
Hey!

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:57.752
Scratch, scratch,
scratch, scratch.

01:20:57.752 --> 01:20:58.854
How did you get in here?

01:20:58.854 --> 01:21:00.822
Did I meet you at the bar?

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:03.792
Hey.

01:21:03.792 --> 01:21:04.693
Hey!

01:21:06.828 --> 01:21:08.463
No!

01:21:08.462 --> 01:21:11.131
No, I'm calling 9-1-1.

01:21:11.131 --> 01:21:13.167
I'm getting you outta here.

01:21:13.167 --> 01:21:15.936
Where's the weed?
- 9-1...

01:21:15.936 --> 01:21:17.438
Weed.
- 1.

01:21:20.408 --> 01:21:22.177
Hey, Operator?

01:21:22.176 --> 01:21:24.445
Yeah, there's somebody...

01:21:24.445 --> 01:21:25.546
There's somebody in my house.

01:21:25.546 --> 01:21:27.081
You gotta get...

01:21:28.082 --> 01:21:29.016
Yeah.

01:21:29.016 --> 01:21:31.852
Well, I don't know who she is.

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:34.522
What do you mean, I sound drunk?

01:21:34.521 --> 01:21:35.356
I'm not drunk.

01:21:35.356 --> 01:21:37.091
You're drunk.

01:21:37.091 --> 01:21:38.259
No, come over.

01:21:39.828 --> 01:21:41.329
What do you look like?

01:21:41.328 --> 01:21:42.796
I've got an intruder
in my house.

01:21:42.796 --> 01:21:44.131
You gotta come right...

01:21:44.131 --> 01:21:45.032
You gotta...

01:21:45.033 --> 01:21:45.834
Ow!

01:21:46.701 --> 01:21:48.003
Goodbye.

01:21:48.002 --> 01:21:50.671
What is wrong with you?
- So long.

01:21:50.671 --> 01:21:51.639
Yeah, okay.

01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.642
Yeah, Operator, I'll hold.

01:22:00.981 --> 01:22:03.117
One minute you want me here,

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:05.654
the other, you don't.

01:22:05.654 --> 01:22:07.722
Make up your mind already.

01:22:07.721 --> 01:22:11.992
I didn't really call the
police on you, you know?

01:22:15.195 --> 01:22:16.797
A writer's right.

01:22:18.265 --> 01:22:19.700
How original.

01:22:19.701 --> 01:22:21.670
What do you want, Blue?

01:22:21.670 --> 01:22:24.172
Howard, why
don't you grow a pair?

01:22:24.171 --> 01:22:27.308
Shut the fuck up.

01:22:27.309 --> 01:22:29.678
We both know you
do better than that.

01:22:29.677 --> 01:22:31.445
Yeah, if you'd let me write.

01:22:31.445 --> 01:22:32.813
Oh my god!

01:22:33.747 --> 01:22:35.683
It's the "Kim K Clan" show.

01:22:35.684 --> 01:22:37.385
Well, what race are you?

01:22:37.385 --> 01:22:38.620
I'm white, hello?

01:22:38.619 --> 01:22:41.288
Look at all this
glitz and glam.

01:22:41.288 --> 01:22:42.890
Hollywood is fascinating.

01:22:42.890 --> 01:22:45.592
Yeah, fascinating bullshit.

01:22:45.592 --> 01:22:47.461
The Kartrashian's.

01:22:47.462 --> 01:22:48.697
Hi, I'm Khloé.

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:49.998
I have my own line-
- Shh.

01:22:49.997 --> 01:22:52.733
I'm a billionaire.
- Oh, god.

01:22:52.734 --> 01:22:55.070
Haters are gonna
hate, hate, hate.

01:22:55.069 --> 01:22:58.439
You're just jealous, because
they got their own show.

01:22:58.439 --> 01:23:01.475
Well, I'd have my own show
if I had  out to here

01:23:01.475 --> 01:23:03.277
and up to here.

01:23:03.278 --> 01:23:04.512
Down periscope.

01:23:05.713 --> 01:23:08.182
So are you ready
to join the clan?

01:23:08.182 --> 01:23:09.016
The what?

01:23:09.016 --> 01:23:09.917
The clan?

01:23:11.219 --> 01:23:12.887
Howard, you're dead.

01:23:14.788 --> 01:23:16.790
Professionally, yeah.

01:23:16.791 --> 01:23:18.626
Well, yeah, that too.

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:20.161
God.

01:23:20.161 --> 01:23:21.596
Now you're getting it.

01:23:21.595 --> 01:23:22.763
I don't like getting it.

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:23.698
But you know what?

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.367
I can make this work, I guess.

01:23:26.201 --> 01:23:27.369
So what do I do?

01:23:27.368 --> 01:23:28.602
Do I gotta like marry
one of you guys?

01:23:28.603 --> 01:23:29.904
I mean, like not
the big foot one,

01:23:29.904 --> 01:23:31.506
but like..

01:23:31.506 --> 01:23:32.907
You're an idiot.

01:23:32.907 --> 01:23:34.542
I am an idiot.

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:39.581
Don't worry, Howie, I
think that we're gonna be

01:23:39.581 --> 01:23:40.882
the breastess of friends.

01:23:40.881 --> 01:23:42.149
The breastess of friends.

01:23:42.149 --> 01:23:43.083
Yes!

01:23:43.083 --> 01:23:44.718
The breastess  is best.

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:46.221
And you are not a virgin!

01:23:46.220 --> 01:23:47.588
No, Howie.
- No!

01:23:47.588 --> 01:23:49.356
Definitely not a virgin.
- Howie!

01:23:49.356 --> 01:23:50.524
Howard!

01:23:50.524 --> 01:23:52.526
I'm not Howard!
- I'm back.

01:23:52.527 --> 01:23:56.765
You know, I'm gonna leave
if you're gonna watch that.

01:23:58.132 --> 01:24:00.401
But you can't leave.

01:24:00.402 --> 01:24:01.669
What are you
talking about, Blue?

01:24:11.311 --> 01:24:13.947
So what you're
saying is I'm dead?

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:14.783
Yes.

01:24:15.850 --> 01:24:17.419
Don't you remember?

01:24:19.287 --> 01:24:22.557
You fell and hit your
head pretty hard.

01:24:23.490 --> 01:24:24.792
No, wait.

01:24:24.792 --> 01:24:26.960
No, you wouldn't remember.

01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:27.962
You're dead.

01:24:30.564 --> 01:24:32.032
Well, if I'm dead,

01:24:32.033 --> 01:24:36.004
that means my life was a
complete and total failure.

01:24:36.837 --> 01:24:37.671
Ow!

01:24:39.506 --> 01:24:42.543
Why would you say
something like that?

01:24:42.543 --> 01:24:45.045
Because when I went to CBS,

01:24:45.046 --> 01:24:48.249
I threw my script
over the fence,

01:24:48.248 --> 01:24:51.218
and the script came
flying back at me,

01:24:51.219 --> 01:24:53.188
and hit me right in the head.

01:24:56.623 --> 01:24:57.624
Fuckin' CBS.

01:24:59.327 --> 01:25:01.996
But then, I went to Paramount,

01:25:01.996 --> 01:25:03.231
and the pitch
meeting went great.

01:25:03.230 --> 01:25:04.398
They loved the script.

01:25:04.399 --> 01:25:05.567
Adios, Nazi!

01:25:06.533 --> 01:25:07.568
Out of here!

01:25:07.569 --> 01:25:09.904
And the meeting is Monday.

01:25:12.573 --> 01:25:13.640
Oh, I'm dead.

01:25:14.975 --> 01:25:17.511
But do you hear
yourself talking, Howard?

01:25:17.511 --> 01:25:21.048
You had a meeting with
CBS and Paramount?

01:25:21.048 --> 01:25:22.249
But let me...

01:25:22.250 --> 01:25:24.219
Okay, how many people
wanna be writers?

01:25:24.219 --> 01:25:26.754
They like the idea
of being writers?

01:25:26.753 --> 01:25:28.255
Ooh, I'm gonna be a writer.

01:25:28.256 --> 01:25:31.926
Oh, I'm gonna get a cabin,
and get retreats, and write.

01:25:31.926 --> 01:25:34.395
Life is a real hustle.

01:25:34.395 --> 01:25:37.398
Those people don't even try.

01:25:37.398 --> 01:25:40.568
You did it, and look
how far you went?

01:25:43.003 --> 01:25:45.072
Fuck you, studios!

01:25:54.916 --> 01:25:57.919
You're gonna be
okay, Howie cakes.

01:25:59.186 --> 01:26:00.787
You're gonna be fine.

01:26:00.787 --> 01:26:03.857
You were happy once, Howard

01:26:03.858 --> 01:26:06.528
Why couldn't you leave it alone?

01:26:08.496 --> 01:26:13.001
You'll never have a son to
preserve the Original name.

01:26:13.967 --> 01:26:16.370
Howie, all she needs is love.

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:21.242
How did this all go wrong?

01:26:24.811 --> 01:26:26.880
Don't let her walk
away like that.

01:26:28.515 --> 01:26:30.217
I'm getting out of here.

01:26:30.217 --> 01:26:32.986
I'm getting out of
here regardless.

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:33.821
What?

01:26:40.228 --> 01:26:41.262
Howard, no!

01:26:41.261 --> 01:26:42.095
No!

01:26:42.095 --> 01:26:43.664
What are you doing?

01:27:50.965 --> 01:27:51.799
Howard!

01:28:07.481 --> 01:28:09.583
We what?

01:28:09.583 --> 01:28:12.419
Okay, so I didn't
see that coming.

01:28:13.988 --> 01:28:15.390
FML.

01:28:15.390 --> 01:28:17.892
Okay, so Howard is, well, her.

01:28:20.427 --> 01:28:21.261
Oh my god.

01:28:22.162 --> 01:28:23.930
Is he cheating on me?

01:31:52.038 --> 01:31:54.708
Meeting Howard was a
very different experience.

01:31:54.708 --> 01:31:57.878
I'm not used to men pushing
me away the way he did,

01:31:57.878 --> 01:32:00.614
which is probably why
I'm so attracted to him.

01:32:00.614 --> 01:32:03.884
And I can definitely
see myself marrying him,

01:32:03.885 --> 01:32:06.087
even though he's white.

01:32:06.087 --> 01:32:09.423
So the only thing I
would really say is,

01:32:10.423 --> 01:32:11.892
it's so weird,

01:32:11.893 --> 01:32:15.129
but there's a really strange
smell about dead people,

01:32:15.128 --> 01:32:17.464
and he definitely
had like a musty,

01:32:17.465 --> 01:32:21.669
like interesting, kinda good
smelling thing about him.

01:32:21.668 --> 01:32:23.103
Oh my god!

01:32:23.104 --> 01:32:25.206
That could be a new cologne.

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.841
My goodness.

01:32:26.841 --> 01:32:28.209
I can finally make more money

01:32:28.208 --> 01:32:30.777
than my little sister, Kylie.

01:32:30.778 --> 01:32:32.914
A billionaire at 18?

01:32:32.913 --> 01:32:33.747
My god.

01:32:35.149 --> 01:32:36.651
I'm gonna be...

01:32:36.650 --> 01:32:38.451
I'm going to be a gazillionaire.

01:33:45.086 --> 01:33:46.487
Ma'am,
gazillion's not a thing.

01:33:46.487 --> 01:33:47.455
What are you talking about?

01:33:47.454 --> 01:33:48.788
Let's continue this.

01:33:49.823 --> 01:33:50.657
Yes, it is.

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:53.327
It was in the contract.

01:33:53.327 --> 01:33:57.064
Shoot, you're embarrassing
me in front of the camera.

01:34:04.537 --> 01:34:05.639
And she's crying.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:07.108
Great.

01:34:07.108 --> 01:34:08.042
I'm gonna record this.

01:34:08.042 --> 01:34:09.944
You're so fucking rude.

01:34:12.246 --> 01:34:13.080
Oh my god.

01:34:14.481 --> 01:34:17.083
10 gazillion likes
in five minutes?
