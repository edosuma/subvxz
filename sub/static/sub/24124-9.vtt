WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.375
I gotta get goin'

00:03.375 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.458
he's just Pooh Bear

00:14.125 --> 00:17.583
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.583 --> 00:21.000
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:27.875
we're so adventurous

00:27.875 --> 00:31.333
and again

00:31.333 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.583 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:41.708 --> 01:43.333
Come on! Jump!

01:43.333 --> 01:46.708
- Oh, no!

02:01.750 --> 02:03.458
Faster!

02:14.583 --> 02:18.458
We're going very down,
Christopher Robin.

02:21.375 --> 02:25.166
Whoa! Hit the brakes!

02:35.166 --> 02:37.458
Oh, no! We're gonna crash!

02:41.958 --> 02:43.583
Uh-uh-uh!

02:43.583 --> 02:46.000
Escaping from
your bedroom again?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.833
Okay, mister.
Back to bed.

02:48.833 --> 02:52.000
While your mother's away,
I'm in charge, 'kay?

02:52.000 --> 02:54.333
Uh, all right.

02:54.333 --> 02:57.500
Babysitters.
Who needs 'em?

02:57.500 --> 03:00.708
That guy'd stay up
all night if I let him.

03:05.375 --> 03:08.208
Tiggers are terrible
at being bored.

03:10.000 --> 03:13.583
I suppose it's too
after dinner for breakfast.

03:13.583 --> 03:16.708
And too after d-d-dark
for sleeping.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.708
Hey, wait a minute!

03:22.000 --> 03:26.583
She said get into bed,
but she didn't say go to sleep.

03:26.583 --> 03:28.833
Hey, you're right, Tigger.

03:31.875 --> 03:34.875
Yeah, but what can we do
in bed besides sleeping?

03:34.875 --> 03:39.208
I'm thinking about
all the honey that isn't here.

03:39.208 --> 03:42.375
But there's pillows.

03:42.375 --> 03:47.250
And where there's pillows,
there's pillow fights!

03:49.458 --> 03:50.708
-

03:50.708 --> 03:53.375
Oh, yeah? Take this!

03:54.291 --> 03:56.250
Oh, sorry, Piglet.

03:58.416 --> 04:01.583
Ahoy! Arr, mateys!

04:16.958 --> 04:20.583
You may fire when ready,
First Mate Pooh Bear!

04:27.416 --> 04:30.166
Are we ready yet, Piglet?

04:30.166 --> 04:31.458
What, Pooh?

04:31.458 --> 04:32.833
Fire!

04:32.833 --> 04:33.875
Yipe!

04:35.291 --> 04:37.416
Ha! Shiver me Tiggers!

04:37.416 --> 04:40.166
You couldn't hit
the broad side of a barnacle.

04:42.291 --> 04:46.416
I'm the meanest piratiest pirate
that ever pirated!

04:46.416 --> 04:50.333
So hand over your honey,
or I'll makes you walk
the plank!

04:50.333 --> 04:53.333
Honey? Did he say honey?

04:56.458 --> 05:00.458
Long John Tigger is after
our treasure.

05:01.875 --> 05:04.583
I know a safe place for it.

05:13.166 --> 05:16.375
How can one Long John Tigger
fire so many pillows?

05:16.375 --> 05:18.833
Oh, it's what
Long John Tiggers do best!

05:24.000 --> 05:27.000
Quick, men!
We need more pillows!

05:31.708 --> 05:34.500
We'll show 'em!

05:46.500 --> 05:47.958
Oh, d-d-dear.

05:47.958 --> 05:49.625
A talking pillow?

05:50.708 --> 05:51.875
Yikes!

05:51.875 --> 05:53.416
Oof!

05:56.416 --> 06:00.833
How embarrassing.
I been sunk by a piglet
disguised as a pillow.

06:00.833 --> 06:04.208
Oh, you're not so mean,
Long John Tigger.

06:04.208 --> 06:06.583
Are you?

06:06.583 --> 06:10.333
Hey, I'm the meanest!

06:10.333 --> 06:11.708
But I gives up easy.

06:12.875 --> 06:15.458
We've done it,
First Mate Pooh!

06:15.458 --> 06:17.333
We saved the honey!

06:18.708 --> 06:21.000
Ooh! Thank goodness.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.083
I never seem to save honey
at home, you know.

06:30.208 --> 06:34.875
Oh, no! We're sailing
over the edge of the bed!

06:51.750 --> 06:54.750
Oh, Christopher Robin!

06:54.750 --> 06:57.750
This bedroom is for sleeping,
not playing!

07:00.875 --> 07:04.375
Oh, I don't believe it.
How could one kid make
such mess?

07:09.583 --> 07:13.000
I'm not sure
this is a good idea.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.500
Hey, all that ocean
made me thirsty.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.875
I just wanna get
a little glass of water.

07:17.875 --> 07:20.625
And a little something
to honey it down with.

07:22.333 --> 07:26.458
Oh, we need to keep
our strength up for sleeping.

07:26.458 --> 07:29.875
All right,
but we have to be quick...

07:29.875 --> 07:31.708
and quiet.

07:31.708 --> 07:32.875
Shh!

07:47.708 --> 07:49.458
Mmm...

07:52.875 --> 07:54.458
Goodness.

07:54.458 --> 07:56.458
Hurry, hurry!

07:56.458 --> 07:59.125
Oh, quickly, Piglet, the cake!

08:00.500 --> 08:01.875
Tigger: You got it.

08:01.875 --> 08:03.125
You got it.

08:03.125 --> 08:04.458
You got it!

08:04.458 --> 08:06.000
- Oh!
- He ain't got it.

08:06.000 --> 08:09.458
Dear! Whoa!

08:09.458 --> 08:11.375
Hey, who turned out the lights?

08:11.375 --> 08:13.333
Dear!

08:13.333 --> 08:15.458
Piglet! Come down!

08:15.458 --> 08:18.375
I d-d-do,
but then I go up again!

08:21.000 --> 08:23.750
I got 'em!

08:23.750 --> 08:25.875
Whoa!

08:28.208 --> 08:29.750
Ha-ha! I got you!

08:31.708 --> 08:35.083
Oh, Christopher Robin!

08:35.083 --> 08:37.291
Just look at this mess!

08:37.291 --> 08:42.458
If your mom saw this,
she'd never let me
babysit again!

08:42.458 --> 08:45.000
Christopher Robin:
But we made the mess.

08:45.000 --> 08:49.708
But I'm responsible.
Your mother left me in charge.

08:49.708 --> 08:51.166
Sorry.

08:52.833 --> 08:56.208
Okay, let's really try
this time.

08:56.208 --> 08:59.250
Oh, don't worry.
Sleeping is easy.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.875
See?

09:15.458 --> 09:19.750
Something went bump.
What is it?

09:19.750 --> 09:23.208
Whatever it is,
we better find out.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.750
The babysitter might be
'sponsible for us,

09:26.750 --> 09:29.500
but we're 'sponsible
for the house.

09:29.500 --> 09:32.875
Maybe we should give
w-w-whatever it is

09:32.875 --> 09:34.083
a chance to leave?

09:34.083 --> 09:36.250
No, we gotta surprise it.

09:36.250 --> 09:38.250
And surprise is what
tiggers do best.

09:41.583 --> 09:43.125
Surprised you, didn't I?

09:51.000 --> 09:52.583
Shh.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.583
It's-- It's a dragon.

09:57.583 --> 10:01.250
What's a dragon doing
in my living room?

10:01.250 --> 10:04.250
Sleeping... I hope.

10:04.250 --> 10:06.000
Then let's not wake it.

10:06.000 --> 10:09.250
There's something funny
about this.

10:11.958 --> 10:14.625
Hey, look, you guys!
It's only a--

10:14.625 --> 10:16.291
-

10:17.875 --> 10:20.291
Oh, help! It's got me!

10:20.291 --> 10:23.875
Christopher Robin!

10:23.875 --> 10:26.458
Have no fear,
Tigger is here!

10:26.458 --> 10:29.000
Take this! And that!
And another that!

10:29.000 --> 10:31.208
- And some of this!
- No! Tigger!

10:31.208 --> 10:34.333
- Take one of these!
- It's only a vacuum cleaner!

10:34.333 --> 10:38.000
Some more of these over here!
And-- Uh-oh.

10:38.000 --> 10:41.333
Oh, no!
You put it in reverse!

10:46.125 --> 10:47.833
Hmm.

10:52.458 --> 10:54.125
Christopher Robin!

10:54.125 --> 10:55.833
Wha-- What--

10:55.833 --> 10:58.000
What are you doing?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.458
But Mom, it isn't my fault.

11:00.458 --> 11:01.958
What a disaster!

11:01.958 --> 11:03.625
Oh, I'm so sorry.

11:03.625 --> 11:05.208
I thought he was asleep.

11:05.208 --> 11:07.750
Honest.
I can't imagine how this--

11:07.750 --> 11:09.583
There was this dragon, see?

11:09.583 --> 11:12.375
I-- I-- I mean,
I can't understand why--

11:12.375 --> 11:16.416
And Long John Tigger,
he tried to steal the honey.

11:16.416 --> 11:17.625
Christopher Robin!

11:17.625 --> 11:19.000
Of course,
then we got hungry.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.708
- So Piglet--
- What?!

11:20.708 --> 11:22.583
- He took off in a rocket?
- Oh, you gotta believe--

11:22.583 --> 11:24.708
And then the dragon got Pooh,
and--

11:24.708 --> 11:26.625
That's enough,
young man.

11:26.625 --> 11:29.208
How could you make
such a mess?

11:29.208 --> 11:32.000
It was easy.

11:36.166 --> 11:39.250
Christopher Robin!
Come quick!

11:39.250 --> 11:41.333
Yeah!
For goodness sakes, hurry!

11:41.333 --> 11:44.875
Someone has stolen
the color outside.

11:44.875 --> 11:48.416
Christopher Robin:
Silly old bear...

11:48.416 --> 11:50.708
it's the first winter snow.

11:50.708 --> 11:52.458
Oh, yeah, I knew that.

11:52.458 --> 11:55.000
Silly old bear.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.000
Come on! Last one outside
is a-- is a--

11:58.000 --> 11:59.458
the last one outside!

12:03.708 --> 12:06.208
Uh, haven't you
forgotten something?

12:06.208 --> 12:07.833
Nope.

12:07.833 --> 12:10.500
Uh, the mess
you made last night?

12:10.500 --> 12:13.000
Oh, Mom, please?

12:13.000 --> 12:15.375
It's the first winter snow.

12:15.375 --> 12:18.708
All right.
I'll give you one more chance.

12:18.708 --> 12:19.958
Thanks, Mom!

12:19.958 --> 12:23.583
I won't make a mess
for a whole year!

12:23.583 --> 12:26.416
Why do I find that
so hard to believe?

12:29.291 --> 12:30.458
Whee!

12:38.458 --> 12:40.166
Whee!

12:42.708 --> 12:46.583
You'd just better roo yourself
right down here.

12:46.583 --> 12:49.583
You know you're not supposed
to climb that tree.

12:49.583 --> 12:52.125
But I didn't climb it, Mama.

12:52.125 --> 12:54.250
I flew!

12:54.250 --> 12:58.250
Well, no more climbing
or flying today, dear.

12:58.250 --> 13:00.583
I have to go out
this afternoon.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.458
Oh, Mother.

13:02.458 --> 13:05.458
Kanga: So I asked
Christopher Robin
to watch you.

13:05.458 --> 13:08.000
Hiya, little nipper!

13:08.000 --> 13:10.458
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy!

13:10.458 --> 13:12.333
And you be good, Roo,

13:12.333 --> 13:15.250
'cause Christopher Robin's
responsible for you.

13:15.250 --> 13:17.875
Just stay inside and play.

13:17.875 --> 13:20.208
Roo: Okay, Mom.

13:20.208 --> 13:23.708
Kanga: Now, Christopher Robin,
remember Roo's bed time.

13:23.708 --> 13:25.583
It's after his dinner time,

13:25.583 --> 13:27.458
uh, but before
his breakfast time.

13:27.458 --> 13:30.166
Psst! Hey, Tigger,
let's build a snowman.

13:30.166 --> 13:32.375
But remember what
your mother said, Roo?

13:32.375 --> 13:35.875
No going outside?

13:35.875 --> 13:38.000
Who said anything
about going outside?

13:38.000 --> 13:42.000
Come on, Roo!
Building snowmen's
what tiggers do best!

13:43.375 --> 13:47.166
Oh, dear.
Snowmen get very small.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.291
Very fast, indoors.

13:49.291 --> 13:51.833
Oh, no! Roo!

13:51.833 --> 13:55.500
Snowmen are for outside,
not inside.

13:55.500 --> 13:58.708
I'm sorry,
Christopher Robin.

13:58.708 --> 14:02.208
Look, go on outside,

14:02.208 --> 14:03.458
just till I clean up.

14:05.166 --> 14:08.625
Since I'm in charge,
I guess it's my mess, too.

14:08.625 --> 14:11.750
But stay in the yard, Roo!

14:11.750 --> 14:14.333
Hey! Let's play baseball!

14:14.333 --> 14:17.833
But we haven't any bases, Roo.

14:17.833 --> 14:20.208
Okay, we'll play snowball.

14:20.208 --> 14:22.166
I'll toss 'em,
and you catch 'em.

14:24.708 --> 14:28.458
Hey, good catch there, Piglet.
Right in the old breadbasket.

14:28.458 --> 14:31.875
Next time, use your hands,
Piglet.

14:37.583 --> 14:41.125
No. Hands, Piglet. Not head.

14:41.125 --> 14:43.125
Homerun!

14:43.125 --> 14:45.875
Home? Time to go in already?

14:45.875 --> 14:49.125
No. It means a great hit.

14:49.125 --> 14:51.750
Oh, well, I knew that.

14:51.750 --> 14:53.458
Just testing you.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.291
Now let's really homerun one.

14:55.291 --> 14:56.750
Do it for the old Tigger.

14:58.500 --> 15:01.000
That's using your head,
buddy bear!

15:01.000 --> 15:02.708
Yes, Piglet.

15:02.708 --> 15:06.125
I just I'd try it your way.

15:06.125 --> 15:09.125
I was right.
Hands are better.

15:09.125 --> 15:12.875
Come on, Tigger,
throw me a perfect snowball.

15:15.750 --> 15:18.708
Hey! My perfect snowball!

15:18.708 --> 15:22.083
But Roo, are you supposed
to climb that tree?

15:22.083 --> 15:25.583
I'm not climbing,
I'm bouncing.

15:27.083 --> 15:29.875
- What's up?
- Roo is up.

15:29.875 --> 15:32.583
But he's not supposed
to climb that tree.

15:32.583 --> 15:34.583
That's what I told him.

15:34.583 --> 15:38.000
Well, somebody has to go up
there and get him.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.458
But it's so very high,

15:40.458 --> 15:43.083
and I'm so very, very not high.

15:43.083 --> 15:47.083
I'm afraid I'm better at down
than up.

15:48.625 --> 15:51.458
Climbing trees is not
what tiggers do best.

15:51.458 --> 15:54.458
I guess I'll have to do it.

15:54.458 --> 15:57.416
I am the babysitter.

15:57.416 --> 16:00.458
I never thought babysitting
was so much work.

16:02.250 --> 16:06.000
Roo! Come down, please,

16:06.000 --> 16:07.708
before you get hurt.

16:07.708 --> 16:09.875
Soon as I get my snowball.

16:17.208 --> 16:19.500
Your mom wouldn't like this.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.583
Oh, all right.

16:22.583 --> 16:25.458
Can we play hide and seek?

16:25.458 --> 16:27.708
Okay, I'm it.

16:27.708 --> 16:30.000
Hey, can't I be it, too?

16:30.000 --> 16:32.625
Hidin' and seekin'
is what tiggers do best.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.125
Okay, Tigger.

16:34.125 --> 16:37.500
You and Roo hide
while we count to 10.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.750
But stay inside!

16:39.750 --> 16:41.000
- Oh, here!

16:41.000 --> 16:42.291
- One.
- No, no, here!

16:42.291 --> 16:44.166
- Two.
- Over there!

16:44.166 --> 16:45.375
- Pooh: We'll find
Tigger and Roo.
- No, here!

16:45.375 --> 16:47.166
- Three.
- This is no good.

16:47.166 --> 16:50.333
There's too much of me
to hide and too little of it.

16:50.333 --> 16:51.750
Over there! Over there!

16:53.625 --> 16:55.500
- Five, six, seven.
- Quick, in here.

16:55.500 --> 16:58.000
Pooh:
Is 10 before or after 11?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.958
They can see me, Tigger.

16:59.958 --> 17:02.000
Yeah, so can I.

17:02.000 --> 17:05.333
- Hey, I got it. Follow me.
- Eighty, nine, ten!

17:05.333 --> 17:08.000
If we find you, we'll win!

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
Here we come, ready or not!

17:11.500 --> 17:13.458
Oh, no!

17:13.458 --> 17:15.000
Not again!

17:15.708 --> 17:18.000
Roo! Tigger!

17:24.000 --> 17:25.833
Roo!

17:28.125 --> 17:29.625
Tigger!

17:32.833 --> 17:35.291
It could be Roo
and Tigger tracks, Pooh.

17:35.291 --> 17:39.375
Or it could be rabbit
and gopher tracks, Piglet.

17:39.375 --> 17:43.291
But I don't think they're
playing hide and seek.

17:43.291 --> 17:46.125
Hey! It's Buddy Bear and Piglet.

17:46.125 --> 17:47.875
Hide! Hide!

17:51.000 --> 17:55.250
Oh, Roo boy, I found us
the perfect hiding place.

18:01.875 --> 18:04.750
Oh, d-d-dear, there aren't
any more tracks, Pooh.

18:04.750 --> 18:07.458
What do we follow now?

18:07.458 --> 18:10.875
These tracks, Piglet.
And they're fresh.

18:10.875 --> 18:13.833
So we must be close.

18:13.833 --> 18:17.000
It worked!

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
I knew they wouldn't
find us, Roo,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.083
'cause hiding's
what tiggers do best.

18:23.708 --> 18:26.708
Come on, Tigger, let's slide!

18:26.708 --> 18:28.875
My words exactly, Roo.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.166
Last one down is, uh...

18:31.166 --> 18:32.458
is the last one down!

18:33.458 --> 18:35.625
Whee!

18:35.625 --> 18:37.458
Whee!

18:41.875 --> 18:43.625
Whoa!

18:46.875 --> 18:49.125
Yuck!

18:49.125 --> 18:51.875
Tiggers don't like
hidin' in the snow.

18:53.458 --> 18:56.416
Where can we hide?

18:56.416 --> 18:58.625
I got it! The perfect place!

18:58.625 --> 18:59.708
Come on, Roo!

19:09.333 --> 19:11.166
Hello...

19:11.166 --> 19:13.583
uh, everybody?

19:13.583 --> 19:16.625
Roo! Roo, are you here?

19:16.625 --> 19:19.208
He's not here?

19:19.208 --> 19:21.000
Well, isn't he with you?

19:21.000 --> 19:23.500
No, but don't worry, Kanga.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.708
I'm sure Piglet and Pooh
have found him.

19:26.708 --> 19:31.458
These tracks lead in here.
Roo! Are you here, Roo?

19:31.458 --> 19:33.833
Whatever is going on?

19:33.833 --> 19:35.833
Oh, I'm sure he's all right.

19:35.833 --> 19:39.083
You see, Tigger's with him.

19:39.083 --> 19:42.125
Oh, dear!
Now I know he's in trouble!

19:42.125 --> 19:45.125
And it's getting
d-d-dark outside.

19:45.125 --> 19:48.166
You never know what kind
of scary things come out
after dark.

19:48.166 --> 19:49.708
Kanga:
Oh, no!

19:49.708 --> 19:51.833
Did I say scary things?

19:51.833 --> 19:53.875
I meant hairy things.

19:53.875 --> 19:57.375
Oh, d-d-dear, I hope
I didn't mean that, either.

19:57.375 --> 20:00.583
We better start looking
all over again.

20:06.458 --> 20:09.250
Mama seems awful worried.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.000
Yeah, and you'd be, too,

20:11.000 --> 20:13.250
if you were losing
a game of hide and seek.

20:17.875 --> 20:22.125
Kanga: I just know something
awful's happened to Roo.

20:22.125 --> 20:24.250
I'm sure he's okay.

20:24.250 --> 20:27.583
Kanga: I just wish
I knew where Roo was.

20:27.583 --> 20:31.375
Hey, Tigger,
when can we come out?

20:31.375 --> 20:34.416
I'm tired of hiding.

20:34.416 --> 20:37.500
He's never been out
this late before.

20:39.958 --> 20:42.208
Don't cry, Mama.

20:42.208 --> 20:45.416
See? I'll let you find me.

20:45.416 --> 20:48.208
Oh, Roo!

20:48.208 --> 20:49.208
Oh!

20:53.750 --> 20:56.083
What's all the commotion?

20:56.083 --> 20:58.250
Oh, finally found us, huh?

21:00.708 --> 21:02.375
Now it's your turn to be it.

21:05.083 --> 21:06.875
Okay, time for bed.

21:06.875 --> 21:08.875
Right, Christopher Robin?

21:08.875 --> 21:10.625
Right!

21:21.583 --> 21:22.958
Good night, Pooh.

21:22.958 --> 21:25.583
Good night,
Christopher Robin.

21:25.583 --> 21:27.833
Good night, Piglet.

21:27.833 --> 21:29.458
Good night, Pooh.

21:29.458 --> 21:30.875
Good night, Tigger.

21:32.625 --> 21:35.333
Tigger's already asleep.

21:35.333 --> 21:39.375
Yeah, 'cause tiggers are
the best sleepers, you know.

21:44.000 --> 21:48.333
Okay, Christopher... Robin?

21:51.875 --> 21:56.500
I wonder
if somebody switched
Christopher Robins on me.
