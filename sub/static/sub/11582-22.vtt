(male announcer)
In the Criminal Justice System,

00:02.503 --> 00:05.673
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:05.706 --> 00:07.141
In New York City,

00:07.175 --> 00:08.409
the dedicated detectives

00:08.442 --> 00:10.211
who investigate these
vicious felonies

00:10.244 --> 00:11.712
are members of an elite squad

00:11.745 --> 00:13.614
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.647 --> 00:14.782
These are their stories.

00:19.820 --> 00:21.589
(man)
Isn't he going
a little too fast?

00:21.622 --> 00:22.423
(man #2)
Damn right, he is.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.692
Hey, Billy!
Slow it down!

00:24.725 --> 00:26.260
You see how he's driving?
Yeah.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.828
You don't do that.

00:27.861 --> 00:31.299
Billy thinks this is NASCAR,
and he's Richard Petty.

00:31.332 --> 00:33.734
[engine roars]

00:33.767 --> 00:35.536
(man#1)
Where's he going
with that one?

00:38.639 --> 00:40.408
Since when do we do
two cars at once?

00:40.441 --> 00:41.442
We don't.
He's showing off.

00:41.475 --> 00:44.578
(Man #1)
Billy, what are you doing?

00:44.612 --> 00:46.380
(man #2)
Whoa.

00:46.414 --> 00:47.481
What the hell was that?

00:49.517 --> 00:51.385
I think it's a lady's head.

00:53.554 --> 00:54.622
What do we got?

00:54.655 --> 00:56.657
Female.
Early to mid-20s.

00:56.690 --> 00:59.727
Her head, left leg,
and right arm were in the car.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.463
Dismemberment's
not a sex crime.

01:02.496 --> 01:03.831
This one might be.

01:03.864 --> 01:06.100
I found traces of semen
in her throat.

01:06.134 --> 01:08.169
Guy didn't even
let her gargle.

01:08.202 --> 01:10.604
The head and extremities
are barely decomposed.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.140
Probably dead
less than a day.

01:12.173 --> 01:13.607
You get prints?

01:13.641 --> 01:15.276
He cut her hand off
at the wrist.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.744
Maybe he knew she'd be
in the system,

01:16.777 --> 01:18.212
didn't want us
to be able to ID her.

01:18.246 --> 01:19.380
So why leave
the head behind?

01:19.413 --> 01:20.381
Maybe the other parts
are somewhere else.

01:20.414 --> 01:21.815
He left us this.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.252
(Warner)
Take a look.
(Fin) Got ink.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.453
"Leon."
Could be her boyfriend.

01:25.486 --> 01:27.188
Or an ex.
(Warner)
One more thing.

01:27.221 --> 01:29.757
See this surgical scar?
From a knee replacement.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.125
We can get the serial number
from the prosthesis,

01:31.159 --> 01:32.193
trace her from that.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.162
Any idea what was used
to cut her up?

01:34.195 --> 01:37.131
I can't tell you the weapon,
but it was no hack job.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.532
What do you mean?

01:38.566 --> 01:39.633
Each part was skillfully

01:39.667 --> 01:41.369
disarticulated
at the joint

01:41.402 --> 01:43.404
by someone who knew
exactly what they were doing.

01:43.437 --> 01:44.638
Like a butcher.

01:44.672 --> 01:46.740
Or a doctor.

02:37.958 --> 02:39.527
(Cragen)
So what are we dealing
with here?

02:39.560 --> 02:41.262
Probably
a sexual sadist.

02:41.295 --> 02:42.530
What, because he had
oral sex with her

02:42.563 --> 02:43.364
before he chopped her up?

02:43.397 --> 02:45.266
(Fin)
You sure it wasn't
afterwards?

02:45.299 --> 02:47.468
It doesn't matter.
With a guy like this,

02:47.501 --> 02:49.470
the brutality is more arousing
than the intercourse.

02:49.503 --> 02:50.571
So he tortured her.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.373
I don't think so.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.642
There's no coagulated blood
on the cut points.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.278
Which means, he disarticulated
her after he killed her.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.746
(Munch)
You're a sadist,

02:58.779 --> 02:59.913
where's the fun in that?

02:59.947 --> 03:01.215
(Stabler)
Could be some whacko

03:01.249 --> 03:02.650
who wanted to see
how her parts worked.

03:02.683 --> 03:05.286
You know, like, when a kid
pulls the wings off a butterfly.

03:05.319 --> 03:06.787
Anything from
Missing Persons?

03:06.820 --> 03:08.289
Nothing off
the head's description.

03:08.322 --> 03:09.590
We don't even have
enough of an M.O.

03:09.623 --> 03:10.724
to feed to VICAP.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.293
All we know is
this woman was murdered

03:12.326 --> 03:13.727
sometime in the last
24 hours.

03:13.761 --> 03:15.463
Unless his perp
kept her parts

03:15.496 --> 03:16.530
in the refrigerator.

03:16.564 --> 03:17.765
(Fin)
Or his stomach was full.

03:17.798 --> 03:19.733
We got a Hannibal Lecter
running around town?

03:19.767 --> 03:21.735
[cell phone rings]
(Huang)
I doubt that he's a cannibal.

03:21.769 --> 03:22.970
Then where's
the rest of her?

03:23.003 --> 03:24.438
Discarded
somewhere else.

03:24.472 --> 03:25.973
Or maybe he made
a lampshade out of her.

03:26.006 --> 03:28.242
Like Ed Gein, he made them
out of his victims' skin.

03:28.276 --> 03:30.944
We don't need to canvass
any interior decorators.

03:30.978 --> 03:32.846
What do you got?

03:32.880 --> 03:35.316
The company that made the knee
replacement traced it

03:35.349 --> 03:37.285
to the V.A.
up at Fort Hamilton.

03:37.318 --> 03:38.686
You know I can't
discuss a patient.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.820
This one's dead, Doc.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.789
V.A. said you replaced
her knee.

03:41.822 --> 03:44.292
You recognize her?

03:44.325 --> 03:48.496
Manette Combs.
Was it drugs?

03:48.529 --> 03:49.897
Why do you say that?

03:49.930 --> 03:52.466
Manette was in and out
of detox a few times.

03:52.500 --> 03:53.734
For what?

03:53.767 --> 03:55.403
(doctor)
Vicodin.

03:55.436 --> 03:56.870
Manette did a tour of duty
in Iraq

03:56.904 --> 03:58.339
until her supply company

03:58.372 --> 04:00.974
was attacked by
insurgents last year.

04:01.008 --> 04:03.511
Army shipped her home
with a knee full of shrapnel.

04:03.544 --> 04:05.613
You put her on painkillers.

04:05.646 --> 04:07.681
(doctor)
Well, she needed them.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.451
It alleviated the pain,
but she was already hooked.

04:10.484 --> 04:12.986
When I stopped prescribing
the Vicodin,

04:13.020 --> 04:14.455
she turned to heroin.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.789
(Fin)
How do you know?

04:15.823 --> 04:18.826
She came in.
High, begging for drugs.

04:18.859 --> 04:22.062
I tried to--to talk her back
into rehab.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.333
That was the last time
I saw her.

04:25.366 --> 04:27.401
You have an address?

04:29.937 --> 04:34.041
(woman)
Manette wasn't the same when
she came home from the war.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.444
I guess I knew
this would happen.

04:36.477 --> 04:38.346
Why is that?

04:38.379 --> 04:40.414
The Army was
Manette's life.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.616
Straightened her out.

04:42.650 --> 04:45.986
After all the trouble
that she had in high school.

04:46.019 --> 04:49.957
She wanted to go back
when she recovered.

04:49.990 --> 04:53.026
But they gave her
a medical discharge.

04:53.060 --> 04:55.095
She never got over it.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.397
When's the last time
you saw her?

04:56.430 --> 04:59.833
Maybe six,
seven months ago.

04:59.867 --> 05:01.502
(Munch)
You know where
Manette was living?

05:01.535 --> 05:02.836
She wouldn't tell me.

05:02.870 --> 05:05.506
She didn't want me
to go looking for her.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.775
But I'm sure that
she told her boyfriend.

05:07.808 --> 05:10.110
Was his name Leon?

05:10.143 --> 05:13.347
Leon Shragewitz.
How did you know?

05:13.381 --> 05:15.315
His name was tattooed
on Manette's ankle.

05:17.651 --> 05:21.955
I'm not surprised.
She was crazy about him.

05:21.989 --> 05:25.559
He really cared about her.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.761
Leon live around here?
No, Williamsburg.

05:27.795 --> 05:31.532
But he works over in the Bronx
at a kosher slaughterhouse.

05:31.565 --> 05:34.835
He's a butcher.

05:34.868 --> 05:38.038
[sobbing]

05:38.071 --> 05:39.740
You need to talk to Leon?
What for?

05:39.773 --> 05:41.509
We think he may have
witnessed an accident.

05:41.542 --> 05:42.743
What kind of accident?

05:42.776 --> 05:44.545
How 'bout letting us
ask the questions?

05:44.578 --> 05:46.514
Leon called Sunday.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.082
Said he was sick,
didn't know when he'd be back.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.718
Haven't seen or heard
from him since.

05:50.751 --> 05:51.952
Lousy schnurer.

05:51.985 --> 05:53.487
Maybe he really is sick.

05:53.521 --> 05:54.855
It's the girlfriend.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.625
Always has to leave early
because of the girlfriend.

05:57.658 --> 05:59.860
Can he come in late
because of the girlfriend?

05:59.893 --> 06:03.464
She's such a problem, why
doesn't he just get rid of her?

06:03.497 --> 06:04.932
Okay, we're gonna
need an address.

06:04.965 --> 06:06.867
Stay here.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.670
Looks like Leon had
a little obsession for Manette.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.138
Yeah, maybe
a fatal attraction.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.640
He's been missing a week.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.442
She's chopped up,
and he's a butcher.

06:14.475 --> 06:15.943
Think that's enough
for a warrant?

06:15.976 --> 06:17.911
You find Leon,
you tell him he's one day

06:17.945 --> 06:20.414
from being out of a job.

06:22.783 --> 06:25.085
(Munch)
Police, Leon.
We're coming in.

06:25.118 --> 06:27.988
Looks like Leon
took a powder.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.558
Must've figured he did enough
butchering for one week.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.693
This place is awfully neat
for a single guy.

06:32.726 --> 06:35.963
Neat? He's compulsive.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.297
Look at that.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.066
(Munch)
The guy puts labels
on his meat dishes.

06:39.099 --> 06:40.067
His dairy dishes.

06:40.100 --> 06:41.802
Like he's gonna forget.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.104
Labels here too.
On every shelf.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.539
Think Leon's got
a little O.C.D.?

06:45.573 --> 06:46.940
Or else he's just so rigid,

06:46.974 --> 06:48.709
that he can't stand anything
being out of place.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.611
Including his women.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.513
Observant men like Leon
might have trouble dealing

06:52.546 --> 06:54.782
if someone disobeys
God's laws.

06:54.815 --> 06:56.750
You think he killed Manette
because she put a dairy fork

06:56.784 --> 06:58.552
in the meat drawer?

06:58.586 --> 07:01.154
Manette had semen
in her throat.

07:01.188 --> 07:03.624
The Bible says that you're
not supposed spill your seed

07:03.657 --> 07:04.758
except to procreate.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.560
So if she tempted him
and then he gave in,

07:06.594 --> 07:08.596
then maybe he hated
himself so much

07:08.629 --> 07:10.230
that he took it out on her.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.799
There's blood
on these work boots.

07:11.832 --> 07:13.133
The guy works
in a slaughterhouse.

07:13.166 --> 07:14.802
Blood may not be human.

07:14.835 --> 07:18.238
Yeah, but the DNA on Leon's
toothbrush should be.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.040
None of the blood
on Leon's boots is human.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.775
And the DNA
from his toothbrush

07:21.809 --> 07:23.977
doesn't match the semen
from Manette Combs' throat.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.178
So we got another guy
in the picture

07:25.212 --> 07:26.780
that could've killed Manette.

07:26.814 --> 07:27.648
Well, maybe Leon
murdered her

07:27.681 --> 07:29.517
after he caught her
with somebody else.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.652
Maybe whoever
she was shooting up with.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.488
Tox screen turned up
opiates in her system.

07:34.522 --> 07:36.089
Well, my money's
still on Leon.

07:36.123 --> 07:37.491
We just gotta find him.

07:37.525 --> 07:38.726
I might be able
to help you.

07:38.759 --> 07:39.927
How?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.496
I ran the opiate sample
from Manette

07:42.530 --> 07:44.732
through the gas chromatograph
mass-spectrometer.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.133
Took the signature,

07:46.166 --> 07:47.200
sent it to the lab
for comparison.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.802
With what?

07:48.836 --> 07:50.137
GC signatures from samples
from samples

07:50.170 --> 07:52.973
of vouchered drugs
taken off the street.

07:53.006 --> 07:55.142
Because heroin and cocaine
are always cut

07:55.175 --> 07:56.710
with some other substance,

07:56.744 --> 07:58.912
the percentages show up
differently on the graph.

07:58.946 --> 08:00.948
Can we find out where
Manette bought her last shot?

08:00.981 --> 08:02.716
Already did.
[computer beeps]

08:02.750 --> 08:05.786
Heroin sold under
the street brand name,

08:05.819 --> 08:07.555
"Shock and Awe."

08:07.588 --> 08:09.122
Narcotics Task Force

08:09.156 --> 08:12.025
seized a couple of kilos
last month in Crown Heights.

08:15.162 --> 08:18.766
Can I help you officers?

08:18.799 --> 08:20.267
You know her?

08:20.300 --> 08:21.802
Nope.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.070
We're not Narcotics.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.104
Hey, I'm clean.

08:24.137 --> 08:25.172
Tell you what,

08:25.205 --> 08:26.840
if you don't start talking,

08:26.874 --> 08:28.308
you're really gonna see
some "Shock and Awe."

08:28.341 --> 08:30.043
You know her?

08:34.648 --> 08:37.150
Name's Manette, but I haven't
seen her since last week.

08:37.184 --> 08:38.218
You sell to her?

08:38.251 --> 08:39.319
(man)
When she's got money.

08:39.352 --> 08:40.854
Where does she
get her money?

08:40.888 --> 08:41.989
You know,
works for a living.

08:42.022 --> 08:43.691
She's a pro.

08:43.724 --> 08:44.892
We like to think

08:44.925 --> 08:46.226
we're freeing
these uptight Hasidic guys

08:46.259 --> 08:48.796
from their religious
sexual oppression.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.330
Doing God's work.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.132
Any idea who
the last oppressed soul is

08:52.165 --> 08:53.333
that Manette worked on?

08:53.366 --> 08:54.768
It was me.
What happened?

08:54.802 --> 08:56.069
Yeah, I'll tell
you what happened.

08:56.103 --> 08:58.706
I pay her 20 bucks.
We go into the alley.

08:58.739 --> 09:00.941
She does her thing.
I'm zipping up.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.210
And this crazy man runs up
and starts slapping her around.

09:03.243 --> 09:06.046
Is this him?
Yeah.

09:06.079 --> 09:07.581
Anyway, she told him
to get lost,

09:07.615 --> 09:09.617
and he's screaming
at her saying,

09:09.650 --> 09:11.184
she gotta come with him.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.753
And she tried to get away,

09:12.786 --> 09:15.923
but he drags her towards
Nostrand Avenue.

09:15.956 --> 09:18.592
He been around here
since then?
Yeah, like he never left.

09:18.626 --> 09:20.193
All week, in and out
of that synagogue

09:20.227 --> 09:22.329
across the street.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.097
Put this on.

09:24.131 --> 09:25.866
I look Jewish to you?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.835
Respect.

09:40.648 --> 09:41.782
Leon Shragewitz?

09:45.018 --> 09:47.921
Y-Yes.

09:47.955 --> 09:49.890
Police. We need you
to come with us.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.965
We met in the park.

09:57.998 --> 10:00.701
I could tell that she
needed help.

10:00.734 --> 10:04.304
I told her that God
could stop her suffering

10:04.337 --> 10:06.106
if she became observant.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.341
When did you find out
about the drugs?

10:08.375 --> 10:11.745
She was high one night
when she came over.

10:11.779 --> 10:13.346
That make you mad?

10:13.380 --> 10:16.116
She told me what happened
to her in Iraq.

10:16.149 --> 10:17.117
I felt sorry for her.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.118
Not sorry enough

10:18.151 --> 10:20.287
to keep her around.

10:20.320 --> 10:23.156
I wanted to marry her.

10:23.190 --> 10:25.726
But first she had
to be clean.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.928
And she wasn't strong enough.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.362
Maybe she was too strong.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.398
You couldn't control her.

10:31.431 --> 10:34.067
You like to be in control,

10:34.101 --> 10:35.335
don't you, Leon?

10:35.368 --> 10:37.104
Is that why you killed her,
or is it because

10:37.137 --> 10:39.106
you caught her going down
on some skel?

10:39.139 --> 10:41.975
She made herself unclean
by touching him.

10:42.009 --> 10:43.176
(Stabler)
So you chop her up.

10:43.210 --> 10:46.079
What? What are
you talking about?

10:46.113 --> 10:48.882
Leon, I want you to tell us
where the rest of her is.

10:51.218 --> 10:56.056
You--you think
I butchered Manette?

10:56.089 --> 10:57.925
I loved her.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.159
Then why'd you kill her?

11:04.765 --> 11:06.433
She promised to stay clean,

11:06.466 --> 11:09.336
but she wouldn't stop
using the drugs.

11:09.369 --> 11:10.938
And then I saw what--

11:10.971 --> 11:13.006
[sobbing]
what she was doing
to that man.

11:13.040 --> 11:16.076
It must have really
pissed you off.

11:16.109 --> 11:19.212
She had desecrated her body.

11:19.246 --> 11:22.115
I-I pushed her.

11:22.149 --> 11:24.117
She fell down the stairs
into the subway.

11:24.151 --> 11:26.053
And when I went to ch--

11:26.086 --> 11:31.024
I went to check on her,
she was dead.

11:31.058 --> 11:35.062
I wanted to throw myself
in front of a train.

11:35.095 --> 11:36.463
But suicide is a sin.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.832
[clears throat]

11:38.866 --> 11:40.868
(Munch)
When did this happen?

11:40.901 --> 11:43.470
Last Friday.
Around 4:00.

11:43.503 --> 11:47.975
I swear to God,
I swear to God

11:48.008 --> 11:51.311
I did not mean
to kill Manette.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.319
Well, I've heard
better stories.

11:59.352 --> 12:00.988
I think he's
telling the truth.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.355
Why?

12:02.389 --> 12:04.024
Because he swore to God?

12:04.057 --> 12:06.059
Because he had less than an hour
and a quarter to chop her up,

12:06.093 --> 12:07.260
take her to the junkyard
in Inwood,

12:07.294 --> 12:08.361
and get back
before Shabbos.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.063
No way Leon's gonna be

12:10.097 --> 12:13.300
anywhere on Friday
after sunset except in shul.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.936
Someone picked up a dead
Jane Doe in the subway station

12:15.969 --> 12:18.138
at Nostrand and Eastern
Parkway.

12:18.171 --> 12:22.075
Last Friday, 4:40 in
the afternoon, in one piece.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.411
If Leon didn't butcher Manette,
who did?

12:28.548 --> 12:30.250
Last week's subway
Jane Doe?

12:30.283 --> 12:31.952
I performed
the autopsy myself.

12:31.985 --> 12:32.986
And she was all there?

12:33.020 --> 12:34.354
(M.E.)
Physically, yes.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.823
Cause of death?

12:35.856 --> 12:37.090
Heroin trip.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.325
This girl didn't O.D.

12:38.358 --> 12:40.027
I meant she tripped
on the subway stairs

12:40.060 --> 12:41.428
because she was high.

12:41.461 --> 12:45.065
Snapped her C-1 and C-2
vertebrae on the way down.

12:45.098 --> 12:47.300
Damn junkie broke her neck.

12:47.334 --> 12:48.936
Actually, someone
did it for her.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.437
There were no signs
of strangulation.

12:50.470 --> 12:54.107
No attack or defensive wounds.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.542
Her boyfriend copped to helping
her down the steps.

12:55.575 --> 12:57.444
You ruled it accidental.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.279
I stated we found
no evidence of foul play.

12:59.312 --> 13:00.948
So what happened, you peg her
as a homeless junkie,

13:00.981 --> 13:03.150
and just didn't try
to ID her?

13:03.183 --> 13:04.952
Of course we did.

13:04.985 --> 13:06.353
(Stabler)
Well, when you got her,
she still had her fingers.

13:06.386 --> 13:08.288
All you had to do was run
her prints through the system.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.990
She's a war veteran.

13:10.023 --> 13:11.925
(Fin)
Manette Combs.
They're on file.

13:11.959 --> 13:13.193
That's impossible.

13:13.226 --> 13:14.995
The first thing we do
on a Doe is run prints.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.129
You personally?

13:16.163 --> 13:18.031
No, one of the assistants.

13:18.065 --> 13:19.399
Mark Mogan had this one.

13:21.134 --> 13:22.569
Where did he send her?

13:22.602 --> 13:24.437
The same place we send
all unclaimed bodies.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.940
Potter's Field.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.041
Luckily, they hadn't
buried her yet.

13:28.075 --> 13:30.210
Saved us a bundle
in exhumation fees.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.112
Doesn't look like
it was tampered with.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.313
What's left of her remains

13:33.346 --> 13:34.882
have been in here
over a week.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.950
You might wanna use
the Vapo Rub.

13:36.984 --> 13:38.986
Let's hope the rest of her
is in there.

13:39.019 --> 13:40.087
Resting in pieces.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.263
Someone at the Brooklyn M.E.'s
office sandbagged us.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.432
Yeah, I'll bet
his name is Mark Mogan.

13:52.465 --> 13:54.067
Look, man, I just process
them and ship them.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.635
Does that process include

13:55.668 --> 13:57.938
leaving your semen in
Manette Combs' severed throat?

13:57.971 --> 13:59.272
No, that's insane.

13:59.306 --> 14:00.473
So is raping the dead.

14:00.507 --> 14:02.375
You know abusing a corpse
is a crime, Mark?

14:02.409 --> 14:03.476
I never abused anybody.

14:03.510 --> 14:06.146
Three dozen unclaimed bodies
you processed and shipped

14:06.179 --> 14:08.081
are being exhumed right now.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.182
Why?

14:09.216 --> 14:10.483
To see what's
in the caskets.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.219
What's it gonna be?

14:12.252 --> 14:15.388
Some more violated corpses
or just more Beanie Bodies.

14:15.422 --> 14:18.525
Listen, it's not
what you're thinking.

14:18.558 --> 14:20.193
You have no idea
what I'm thinking.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.995
I was performing
a public service.

14:22.029 --> 14:24.031
Even the dead need
a little loving.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.432
I only took junkies and bums.

14:25.465 --> 14:26.499
They didn't contribute
anything to the world

14:26.533 --> 14:28.201
while they were living,
so I helped them contribute

14:28.235 --> 14:29.269
a little after they died.

14:29.302 --> 14:30.470
By chopping them up?

14:30.503 --> 14:32.239
I didn't chop 'em up.

14:32.272 --> 14:33.506
I donated them
to science.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.208
Donating my ass!

14:35.242 --> 14:36.376
How much did you get?

14:39.679 --> 14:41.915
Two grand a body.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.150
But the benefit to medical
research is--

14:43.183 --> 14:45.385
Who'd you hawk them to?

14:45.418 --> 14:49.022
(Stabler)
Who'd you hawk 'em to?

14:49.056 --> 14:51.391
A guy named Russ Bianco.

14:51.424 --> 14:53.961
I call a number,
and he meets me.

15:04.104 --> 15:05.105
You Bianco?

15:05.138 --> 15:06.239
Yeah, where's Mogan?

15:06.273 --> 15:07.307
Ah, he couldn't make it.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.709
He knew I needed the cash.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.578
Name's Elliot.
I work in the morgue with him.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.380
You got a city ID?

15:16.249 --> 15:19.319
Fresh off the slab.

15:19.352 --> 15:23.056
Uh, he's not an addict.

15:23.090 --> 15:24.624
No.

15:24.657 --> 15:26.126
That guy's in better shape
than the stiffs

15:26.159 --> 15:27.294
Mark usually sends me.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.729
Brain hemorrhage.
Tox screen clean.

15:29.762 --> 15:32.565
Sold.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.101
Nice gig Mark's
got going here.

15:34.134 --> 15:37.337
How's your supply?

15:37.370 --> 15:39.506
Always looking for more.

15:39.539 --> 15:40.507
Why?

15:40.540 --> 15:43.076
One of my cousins works
in the Manhattan Morgue.

15:45.745 --> 15:48.581
Make sure he's discreet.

15:48.615 --> 15:51.051
You see something you think
I'll like, give me a call.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.652
All right.

15:52.685 --> 15:54.354
Wanna give me a hand
with this guy?
Sure.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.630
Bet he's got plenty of hands

16:03.663 --> 16:05.598
and other pieces stashed
somewhere.

16:05.632 --> 16:06.733
Maybe he's dipping
them in wax,

16:06.766 --> 16:08.135
passing them off
as sculpture.

16:08.168 --> 16:09.436
What?

16:09.469 --> 16:10.370
A classic Vincent Price
movie.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.105
You gotta see it.

16:12.139 --> 16:15.075
I'd rather see where Bianco's
hauling Mr. Dead Body.

16:15.108 --> 16:18.745
[engine starts]

16:24.084 --> 16:25.618
Hudson Medical School?

16:25.652 --> 16:28.221
Can't believe they'd hire
a sleazoid like Bianco.

16:28.255 --> 16:30.123
Looks like he's
an outside contractor.

16:30.157 --> 16:33.660
Does that jacket say UPS?

16:33.693 --> 16:35.028
(Fin)
Says A.P.S.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.297
Anatomical Procurement
Services.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.632
Cooler's too small
for our body.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.434
And he didn't have time
to cut it up.

16:45.172 --> 16:47.207
This is unacceptable.
The order was for 20 knees.

16:47.240 --> 16:49.242
Well, your students
will just have to share.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.311
My students are surgeons
getting CME credit

16:51.344 --> 16:52.745
in advanced arthroscopic
techniques.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.314
These people are not
accustomed to sharing.

16:54.347 --> 16:55.682
Actually, that won't
be a problem.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.784
I'm sorry, there is no auditing
of this course.

16:57.817 --> 16:59.219
We're not here
to audit the course.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.588
We're here to audit
the school supplies.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.056
(doctor)
This medical school
buys thousands of body parts.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.791
But I assure you,
all the paperwork is in order.

17:04.824 --> 17:06.693
Where do you think
you're going, Frankenstein?

17:06.726 --> 17:08.261
Well, I just make deliveries.

17:08.295 --> 17:09.762
I don't know where
they come from.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.098
(Munch)
Russ Bianco,
you're under arrest.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.265
For what?

17:12.299 --> 17:15.368
For snatching bodies
and selling the pieces.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.836
Look, I didn't steal anything.

17:16.869 --> 17:19.506
I work in the mortuary
as St. Mark's Medical Center.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.242
I oversee the Anatomical
Procurement Services.

17:22.275 --> 17:24.377
Yeah, they confirmed that.
Okay.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.313
So we provide specimens
to schools and researchers.

17:26.346 --> 17:27.414
It's illegal to profit

17:27.447 --> 17:29.182
from the sale of body parts.

17:29.216 --> 17:30.817
Look, we only charge

17:30.850 --> 17:32.685
for their transportation,
storage, and processing.

17:32.719 --> 17:35.655
It is a vital, legal service.
And it's all above board.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.690
As long as the bodies are
donated, not paid for.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.859
Who donated the body
in the back of your van?

17:39.892 --> 17:42.762
I don't know, but I can
get you the paperwork.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.397
You have any paperwork
on Manette Combs?

17:44.431 --> 17:46.699
Who?
(Cragen)
Manette wasn't an organ donor.

17:46.733 --> 17:48.668
She never willed
her body to science.

17:48.701 --> 17:50.503
And you bought her corpse
from Mark Mogan

17:50.537 --> 17:52.639
at the Brooklyn M.E.'s office.

17:52.672 --> 17:54.707
Chopped her up.
Sold her parts.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.743
And then dumped
what you couldn't sell.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.878
I don't know what you're
talking about.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.847
(Stabler)
That's not what
you told me before.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.216
(Bianco on tape)
Make sure he's discreet.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.253
You see something you think
I'll like, give me a call.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.255
What, you set me up?

18:08.288 --> 18:11.491
Her face ring a bell?

18:11.524 --> 18:14.361
We found her head,
her arm, and a leg.

18:14.394 --> 18:17.630
Where's the rest of her?

18:17.664 --> 18:20.700
Ask my lawyer.

18:23.936 --> 18:26.439
Bianco doesn't have a stolen leg
to stand on, does he?

18:26.473 --> 18:27.907
No, he ripped off donated
bodies from his employer

18:27.940 --> 18:29.309
and then sold them.

18:29.342 --> 18:30.677
And when he couldn't
fill his orders,

18:30.710 --> 18:32.345
he bought a few stiffs
from the City Morgue.

18:32.379 --> 18:33.680
Yeah, where was he
keeping them?

18:33.713 --> 18:35.648
St. Mark's would've noticed
the extra inventory.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.650
So he can't be storing
his bodies there.

18:37.684 --> 18:39.519
Just got Bianco's financials.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.389
He makes a hefty payment every
month to Randy's Wine Locker.

18:42.422 --> 18:43.656
Maybe he's an oenophile.

18:43.690 --> 18:45.358
I don't know
what that is,

18:45.392 --> 18:47.327
but I can tell you he doesn't
spend anything on wine.

18:47.360 --> 18:49.829
Those storage places
are climate-controlled.

18:49.862 --> 18:53.166
You better call
the M.E.

18:53.200 --> 19:00.139
Hands, feet, knees,
heart, liver...

19:02.709 --> 19:04.877
It's a one-stop
chop shop.

19:04.911 --> 19:06.946
It's just plain creepy.

19:06.979 --> 19:11.718
Ah, and this must be
an unprocessed donor.

19:11.751 --> 19:14.254
Scar on his back
still has stitches.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.256
(Warner)
Vertical incision
parallel to the spine.

19:16.289 --> 19:17.590
Avoiding the paraspinus muscle.

19:17.624 --> 19:19.926
And for those of us
that aren't doctors?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.661
His kidney was removed.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.931
(Fin)
For some medical student
to practice on.

19:24.964 --> 19:26.666
We got a big problem here.

19:26.699 --> 19:27.667
(Fin)
Yeah, trying to figure out

19:27.700 --> 19:29.969
who all these parts
belong to.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.671
I'm talking about this incision.
It started to heal.

19:31.704 --> 19:33.906
(Munch)
How is that possible?

19:33.940 --> 19:36.343
This man was alive
when Bianco took out his kidney.

19:44.351 --> 19:45.485
(Stabler)
Novak's waiting
for your ruling

19:45.518 --> 19:46.953
so she can indict
Russ Bianco for murder.

19:46.986 --> 19:48.455
I don't think
there was a murder.

19:48.488 --> 19:50.523
John Doe here died
of a pulmonary embolism.

19:50.557 --> 19:52.725
Blood clot to his lung.

19:52.759 --> 19:54.561
So taking out his kidney
didn't kill him?

19:54.594 --> 19:56.829
Embolism can happen
after any surgery.

19:56.863 --> 19:58.931
Or butchery
by Bianco.

19:58.965 --> 20:00.433
Bianco didn't operate.

20:00.467 --> 20:01.801
Judging by the technique,

20:01.834 --> 20:03.336
this surgery was
performed by a pro.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.704
What was wrong with him?

20:04.737 --> 20:06.573
As far as I can tell,
nothing.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.775
Your victim had no signs
of renal disease.

20:08.808 --> 20:10.543
And no one matching
his description

20:10.577 --> 20:11.811
had a kidney removed recently

20:11.844 --> 20:13.480
at any hospital
in the tri-state.

20:13.513 --> 20:17.317
Only reason I can think
to remove a healthy kidney

20:17.350 --> 20:18.618
is to donate it.

20:18.651 --> 20:21.721
Or to sell it
on the black market.

20:21.754 --> 20:24.357
You gotta be kidding me.
Bianco's selling parts
from dead bodies.

20:24.391 --> 20:26.359
Gotta be a lot
more money in live ones.

20:26.393 --> 20:28.861
Sure he wasn't found in a hotel
room in a bathtub full of ice?

20:28.895 --> 20:30.963
With the telephone next to him
and a note to call 911?

20:30.997 --> 20:32.365
That's just an urban legend,
Captain.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.033
How we doing
on John Doe's ID?

20:34.066 --> 20:35.668
(Fin)
Thomas Taylor, 34.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.404
Took a collar
for shoplifting last year.

20:37.437 --> 20:38.671
No known address.

20:38.705 --> 20:39.906
This much tooth decay?

20:39.939 --> 20:41.574
He hasn't seen
a dentist in years.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.875
He's probably homeless.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.944
So Bianco was recruiting
poor people off the street.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.045
You got a desperate guy.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.714
Bianco offers him
a couple grand.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.449
He'd sell his kidney
and his mother's.

20:49.482 --> 20:51.984
And Bianco jacks up the price
and flips it to some rich dude.

20:52.018 --> 20:53.320
Another example
of how the wealthy

20:53.353 --> 20:54.654
get better health care.

20:54.687 --> 20:55.755
People wouldn't
be buying kidneys

20:55.788 --> 20:57.290
if there were enough donors.

20:57.324 --> 20:59.025
You think selling organs
should be legal?

20:59.058 --> 21:01.661
Why not? People can sell
their blood, sperm, and eggs.

21:01.694 --> 21:03.596
Of course, there's more where
that stuff came from.

21:03.630 --> 21:05.398
You only need
one kidney to live.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.866
There'd be more to transplant

21:06.899 --> 21:07.834
if people were allowed
to sell them.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.902
What about those that
can't afford to buy one?

21:09.936 --> 21:11.838
Are their lives worth less
because they're poor?

21:11.871 --> 21:14.474
Sixteen people in this country
die every day

21:14.507 --> 21:15.375
waiting for a kidney.

21:15.408 --> 21:16.876
Rich and poor.

21:16.909 --> 21:18.745
We need a system
that will save more lives.

21:18.778 --> 21:20.313
Well, until the law
is changed,

21:20.347 --> 21:21.548
we're gonna have to collar
the surgeon

21:21.581 --> 21:23.450
and whoever bought
John Doe's kidney.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.852
Then start with the National
Transplant Clearing Center.

21:25.885 --> 21:27.620
Everyone on their list
waiting for a kidney

21:27.654 --> 21:30.323
is a potential suspect.

21:32.725 --> 21:33.893
(man)
A subpoena?

21:33.926 --> 21:34.894
These people are sick.

21:34.927 --> 21:36.829
They have a right to privacy.

21:36.863 --> 21:38.731
I'm sure the NTCC
doesn't condone

21:38.765 --> 21:40.032
the sale of black market
kidneys.

21:40.066 --> 21:41.534
Of course not.

21:41.568 --> 21:42.869
The most critical patients
should be getting

21:42.902 --> 21:44.404
first crack at these organs.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.905
Regardless of wealth.

21:45.938 --> 21:47.807
How many people
are we talking about?

21:47.840 --> 21:50.810
5,000 in New York State
waiting for kidney transplants.

21:50.843 --> 21:53.112
Last year,
we had about 1,000 donors.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.981
What happened to the people
who don't get one?

21:55.014 --> 21:56.916
Some died.

21:56.949 --> 21:59.919
The lucky ones are still
on dialysis, waiting.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.721
We're doing our best
to encourage

22:01.754 --> 22:03.423
more people to donate.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.091
There you go.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.427
700 names.

22:07.460 --> 22:10.530
New York first.

22:12.164 --> 22:14.434
(Stabler)
John, you see who's
at the top of the list?

22:14.467 --> 22:17.970
I saw.
Amy Solwey.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.887
John.
Thought you were
still in prison.

22:34.921 --> 22:36.989
[interpreter's voice]
I got out three months ago.

22:37.023 --> 22:39.426
How?

22:39.459 --> 22:41.861
Compassionate release.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.063
I had the transplant,
but rejected the kidney.

22:44.096 --> 22:47.567
Guess the state didn't want
to pay my hospital bill.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.968
How did you
find me?

22:49.001 --> 22:50.603
NTCC list.

22:50.637 --> 22:52.472
Says you're next in line.

22:52.505 --> 22:55.107
For once, the sicker I am,
the better.

22:55.141 --> 22:57.610
How sick?

22:57.644 --> 23:00.046
End stage renal failure.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.948
And now, heart damage.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.517
So any day now.

23:04.551 --> 23:07.987
As soon as some perfectly
healthy person

23:08.020 --> 23:12.592
with my blood type is murdered
or has a terrible accident.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.562
Kind of hard to pray for.
Waiting's got to be rough.

23:15.595 --> 23:18.164
Better than the alternative.

23:18.197 --> 23:19.932
You ever think of going
on the black market?

23:19.966 --> 23:24.904
You gonna bust me
if I say yes?

23:24.937 --> 23:27.507
People say it's wrong
to sell a kidney.

23:27.540 --> 23:31.110
But then, how come they pay
everyone else?

23:31.143 --> 23:34.747
The transplant team.
The NTCC.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.148
The hospitals.

23:36.182 --> 23:39.952
The people who make
the rules aren't dying.

23:42.722 --> 23:44.624
Why did you come here?

23:44.657 --> 23:45.692
Because you have type A blood,

23:45.725 --> 23:47.126
and we found a guy who died

23:47.159 --> 23:48.528
after selling his kidney
on the black market.

23:48.561 --> 23:49.796
Also type A.

23:49.829 --> 23:52.499
I don't need his kidney.

23:52.532 --> 23:54.634
I'm at the top
of the transplant list.

23:54.667 --> 23:58.971
You should be starting
at the bottom.

24:01.273 --> 24:03.109
(woman)
I'm number 37.

24:03.142 --> 24:04.711
I've been waiting
for five years.

24:04.744 --> 24:07.179
But the sicker ones keep
moving up the list past me.

24:07.213 --> 24:08.781
You having any
problems, Carmen?

24:08.815 --> 24:10.149
Not yet.

24:10.182 --> 24:14.086
But I'd like to get off
this thing and have a life.

24:14.120 --> 24:16.823
In Peru, you can get
a kidney in 48 hours.

24:16.856 --> 24:18.958
People line up around
the block to sell them.

24:18.991 --> 24:20.560
Surprised you're not
on a plane right now.

24:20.593 --> 24:22.161
(Carmen)
I would be.

24:22.194 --> 24:25.264
If I had 100 grand to pay
for a transplant.

24:25.297 --> 24:28.067
Here, I'll probably
die waiting.

24:28.100 --> 24:30.837
I've been waiting seven years,
and I'm sick of nurses

24:30.870 --> 24:33.973
and doctors and hospitals
and praying.

24:34.006 --> 24:35.241
Man of your means
has other options.

24:35.274 --> 24:37.644
Buy a kidney?
No.

24:37.677 --> 24:40.046
I've had a good life.
No regrets.

24:40.079 --> 24:42.081
I'd rather leave
the money to my grandchildren.

24:42.114 --> 24:45.117
But you'd know where to go
if you changed your mind.

24:45.151 --> 24:45.952
Everybody does.

24:45.985 --> 24:47.787
We used to talk
about it all the time

24:47.820 --> 24:49.589
in my dialysis group.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.157
(Fin)
Can you give us a name?

24:51.190 --> 24:53.926
I could, but it would
only be a rumor.

24:53.960 --> 24:57.063
And I don't necessarily
believe it's wrong.

24:57.096 --> 24:59.231
Then why didn't
you do it?

24:59.265 --> 25:00.900
(husband)
Because we spent 90 grand

25:00.933 --> 25:03.069
on our wedding.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.538
There's nothing left.

25:05.572 --> 25:07.940
Now she's gonna die
because I can't even afford

25:07.974 --> 25:11.578
to save her life.

25:15.014 --> 25:17.149
Staying positive
is better for Kyle.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.551
It looks like
it's working.

25:18.585 --> 25:19.886
How long has
he been sick?

25:19.919 --> 25:21.554
Oh, since he was three.

25:21.588 --> 25:23.990
Kyle has polycystic
kidney disease.

25:24.023 --> 25:26.058
We didn't know when we
got pregnant,

25:26.092 --> 25:28.761
but James and I both
carry an abnormal gene

25:28.795 --> 25:30.062
that causes PKD.

25:30.096 --> 25:31.664
How long has Kyle
been on the NTCC list?

25:31.698 --> 25:32.732
Two years.

25:32.765 --> 25:35.134
But, uh,

25:35.167 --> 25:39.171
we just keep praying
for a miracle.

25:39.205 --> 25:40.807
So anyone suddenly
come into a kidney?

25:40.840 --> 25:43.876
The only folks that dropped off
the transplant list died.

25:43.910 --> 25:46.312
John Doe's kidney could've gone
into someone from out of town.

25:46.345 --> 25:48.948
Let's focus on finding
the surgeon and the next buyer.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.584
James McGovern?

25:51.618 --> 25:54.320
He was debt free, so to speak,
until two weeks ago.

25:54.353 --> 25:56.889
McGovern took out
a second mortgage.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.725
Cash advances
on his credit card.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.059
And drained Kyle's college fund.

26:00.092 --> 26:02.662
To the tune of?
(Cragen)
$125,000.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.664
Which was wired yesterday
into the personal account

26:04.697 --> 26:06.766
of our favorite
local body snatcher.

26:06.799 --> 26:08.334
Russ Bianco.

26:08.367 --> 26:10.069
Okay, I made a deal
with James McGovern.

26:10.102 --> 26:11.303
So you admit
you sold him a kidney.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.706
Did I say that?
See, I don't think I said that.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.908
He wants to be a wise ass, let's
let the feds deal with him.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.176
They're gonna need someone
to testify against me,

26:17.209 --> 26:18.344
so good luck.

26:18.377 --> 26:19.679
You really enjoy
playing God, don't you?

26:19.712 --> 26:21.013
I'm saving lives.

26:21.047 --> 26:23.115
I'm a hero, man,
I'm the future.

26:23.149 --> 26:25.151
I connect the needy
with the need.

26:25.184 --> 26:27.854
Yeah, you're a real
humanitarian using the poor

26:27.887 --> 26:30.089
as spare parts suppliers
for people with money.

26:30.122 --> 26:31.758
The donor gets paid,
a dying person lives,

26:31.791 --> 26:33.626
everybody wins.

26:33.660 --> 26:34.927
(Stabler)
Especially you,
after you get your cut.

26:34.961 --> 26:36.696
What, I'm not entitled?
I assume all the risk.

26:36.729 --> 26:37.997
It's business.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.365
You know how many bodies
I see come through

26:39.398 --> 26:40.299
my hospital mortuary
each week?

26:40.332 --> 26:41.801
No.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.135
Accident victims.

26:43.169 --> 26:46.072
Kids with healthy, beautiful,
transplantable organs

26:46.105 --> 26:48.107
that their loved ones won't sign
a consent to donate.

26:48.140 --> 26:50.042
That's their choice.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.244
You wouldn't be saying that
if it was your mother.

26:52.278 --> 26:54.346
Or your wife, or your child
that were dying.

26:54.380 --> 26:57.283
You know, you'd be begging
for my phone number.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.885
Well, your number's up.

26:58.918 --> 27:00.653
Feds will be putting you away
for ten years easy.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.154
But give us
the transplant surgeon,

27:02.188 --> 27:04.090
and we'll see to it
that you're home by Christmas.

27:04.123 --> 27:05.658
[scoffs]

27:05.692 --> 27:09.829
Man, you guys didn't hear
a word I said, did you?

27:09.862 --> 27:10.997
This guy thinks
he's the second coming.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.364
Well, he's got a point.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.366
Are you an organ donor?
Yup.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.203
I thought Jews had to be buried
with all their body parts.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.038
I figure the big guy
will give me a pass

27:19.071 --> 27:20.773
if I leave a piece of myself
to help someone else.

27:20.807 --> 27:22.041
What about you?

27:22.074 --> 27:23.309
I told Kathy I wanna.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.211
Did you check off
that little box on your license?

27:25.244 --> 27:27.413
No.
Why?

27:27.446 --> 27:29.348
I don't know.
I know why.

27:29.381 --> 27:30.783
You're afraid to face
your own mortality.

27:30.817 --> 27:32.952
Well, who isn't?
We're all gonna die, Elliot.

27:32.985 --> 27:34.921
The only question
is when and how?
[cell phone ringing]

27:34.954 --> 27:36.255
What?

27:36.288 --> 27:38.758
You pulled Bianco's LUDs?

27:38.791 --> 27:41.994
Swell.
Fin?

27:42.028 --> 27:44.296
Yeah. Amy Solwey's been
calling Bianco.

27:48.200 --> 27:50.469
[interpreter's voice]
Everyone who needs a kidney
knows about Russ Bianco.

27:50.502 --> 27:52.038
What's the big deal?

27:52.071 --> 27:53.405
Well,
you called him

27:53.439 --> 27:55.474
a couple dozen times
over the last two months.

27:55.507 --> 27:57.143
You're at the top
of the NTCC list.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.711
What do you need
a guy like that for?

27:58.745 --> 28:01.347
Insurance.

28:01.380 --> 28:03.315
In case my next transplant
doesn't work.

28:03.349 --> 28:04.516
Really?

28:04.550 --> 28:07.153
Or is Bianco paying you to find
buyers for his hot kidneys?

28:07.186 --> 28:10.489
I do it for nothing.

28:10.522 --> 28:11.924
Going to jail for assisted
suicide didn't teach you

28:11.958 --> 28:13.192
a damn thing, did it?

28:13.225 --> 28:15.194
Sure it did.

28:15.227 --> 28:18.030
Now I help people live
instead of die.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.231
Amy, you're still
breaking the law.

28:19.265 --> 28:20.399
Arrest me.

28:20.432 --> 28:22.168
We don't want you,

28:22.201 --> 28:23.369
we want the surgeon who's
performing the transplants.

28:23.402 --> 28:26.272
He's saving lives.

28:26.305 --> 28:29.742
Give us his name,
or you're going back to jail.

28:29.776 --> 28:32.511
No jail's worse than living
in the prison of a sick body.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.213
You'll be living in both
when they take your name

28:34.246 --> 28:35.514
off that transplant list.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.949
That would never happen.

28:36.983 --> 28:38.384
(Stabler)
When the NTCC finds out

28:38.417 --> 28:41.153
that you've been trafficking
in black market kidneys,

28:41.187 --> 28:43.022
they're gonna cross you
right off the list.

28:45.892 --> 28:49.061
[in own voice]
You'd let me die?

28:55.902 --> 28:57.770
Give us the surgeon's name.

28:57.804 --> 29:00.739
We'll make sure no one knows
that you were involved.

29:12.952 --> 29:14.821
Oh, God, no, no.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.156
Please.

29:17.189 --> 29:19.158
Mr. McGovern,
you're under arrest.

29:19.191 --> 29:20.860
Stay here with your son
until we get back.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.094
Please, you can't do this.

29:22.128 --> 29:23.129
Where's Dr. Robert Swan?

29:23.162 --> 29:24.463
In the O.R.

29:24.496 --> 29:26.532
This is my son, please.

29:26.565 --> 29:29.168
(nurse)
You can't go in there.
You'll contaminate the room.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.107
Who the hell are you?

29:35.141 --> 29:37.844
Police. Please stop
what you're doing.

29:37.877 --> 29:39.411
I have to close
this man's incision,

29:39.445 --> 29:42.114
and you have to get out of here
before he gets infected.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.349
Where's his kidney?
(Dr. Swan)
Right there.

29:43.382 --> 29:46.318
And it's going into
Kyle McGovern.

29:46.352 --> 29:48.354
(Stabler)
No, it's not.
It's evidence.

29:48.387 --> 29:50.056
And you're under arrest
for trafficking

29:50.089 --> 29:51.423
in human body parts.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.459
Now close him up.

30:04.871 --> 30:07.139
I've got less than 24 hours
to transplant that kidney.

30:07.173 --> 30:08.474
Doctor, you're not
transplanting anything.

30:08.507 --> 30:10.042
Just, please, get changed.

30:10.076 --> 30:11.944
I'm not going anywhere
until that donor wakes up,

30:11.978 --> 30:13.946
and Kyle McGovern
is transferred to a hospital.

30:13.980 --> 30:15.081
What happened to Kyle?

30:15.114 --> 30:16.548
He's in a hypertensive crisis.

30:16.582 --> 30:18.117
His blood pressure
is through the roof.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.618
He needs a kidney
in the next few days.

30:19.651 --> 30:20.987
He's on the transplant list.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.521
I have a kidney
for this dying boy.

30:22.554 --> 30:24.356
The law says that you can't
save him this way.

30:24.390 --> 30:27.393
Now, Doctor...

30:27.426 --> 30:30.296
please go check on your patient
before we take you in.

30:37.069 --> 30:40.239
That boy shouldn't have
to suffer because of this, John.

30:40.272 --> 30:43.609
NTCC decides
who gets the organs.

30:43.642 --> 30:48.147
Maybe they can
work this out.

30:48.180 --> 30:50.249
Okay, bring Swan
and McGovern in.

30:50.282 --> 30:52.318
Once everything's under control,
I'm gonna tell the NTCC

30:52.351 --> 30:55.922
we've got a kidney.

30:55.955 --> 30:57.589
We can't accept that kidney.
Why not?

30:57.623 --> 30:59.926
Our guidelines strictly
forbid transplanting

30:59.959 --> 31:01.894
any organ that's been paid for.

31:01.928 --> 31:03.462
These are extenuating
circumstances.

31:03.495 --> 31:04.596
Doesn't matter.

31:04.630 --> 31:06.265
Using that kidney would
irreparably

31:06.298 --> 31:07.366
tarnish our reputation.

31:07.399 --> 31:08.567
Screw your reputation.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.636
That kidney will save
a child's life.

31:10.669 --> 31:13.239
We have a hard enough time
finding organs.

31:13.272 --> 31:15.674
Word gets out we're
accepting them

31:15.707 --> 31:17.309
from people who've been paid,

31:17.343 --> 31:19.511
the whole system
would fall apart.

31:19.545 --> 31:20.913
Everyone would want money.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.281
So that's it.

31:22.314 --> 31:24.616
You're just gonna turn your back
on a healthy kidney.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.518
[cell phone rings]

31:26.552 --> 31:28.554
I'm sorry, Detective.

31:28.587 --> 31:30.322
But I have no choice.

31:30.356 --> 31:33.192
John, the NTCC won't take it.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.460
Doesn't matter.

31:34.493 --> 31:36.295
Swan says Kyle is
too unstable right now

31:36.328 --> 31:38.030
to take the transplant.

31:38.064 --> 31:41.200
I'll see you back
at the squad.

32:03.522 --> 32:04.690
Thanks for coming in.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.258
Where are they?

32:06.292 --> 32:08.060
What are you
talking about?

32:08.094 --> 32:09.628
Oh, I just spent the last
15 minutes

32:09.661 --> 32:10.662
looking for Munch,
McGovern, and the doctor.

32:10.696 --> 32:12.264
They're not here?

32:12.298 --> 32:14.166
I checked interrogation,
interview, upstairs.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.567
Only place I didn't try
was the men's room.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.703
You try Munch's cell?
Yeah. No answer.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.538
You know, Dr. Swan
had to make sure

32:19.571 --> 32:21.040
Kyle and the donor were okay.

32:21.073 --> 32:22.975
Maybe there's a problem.

32:23.009 --> 32:24.276
Come on.

32:32.784 --> 32:35.487
What the hell
is going on here?

32:42.161 --> 32:43.562
Casey, take Ms. Solwey
out to the car.

32:44.696 --> 32:47.266
Leave her out of this!

32:47.299 --> 32:48.534
We didn't drag
her into this.

32:50.436 --> 32:54.373
John, relax.
Relax.

32:54.406 --> 32:55.774
Why'd you bring her here?

32:55.807 --> 32:57.443
Amy's next
on the transplant list.

32:57.476 --> 33:00.012
That kidney would've
been hers anyway.

33:00.046 --> 33:03.015
You're doing what we're
trying to stop, John.

33:03.049 --> 33:04.483
That kidney
was bought and sold.

33:04.516 --> 33:06.252
So let's just throw it away.

33:06.285 --> 33:08.320
She dies.

33:08.354 --> 33:13.459
I know that
you care about her.

33:13.492 --> 33:15.327
But you can't do this.
If that was your
son in there--

33:15.361 --> 33:17.029
It's not my son in there.

33:17.063 --> 33:19.465
We're not talking
about my son.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.500
When you collar James McGovern,
you tell him your son's life

33:21.533 --> 33:23.102
is worth more than Kyle's.

33:23.135 --> 33:24.336
I gotta collar you, John.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.572
You arranged this.
Novak saw you here!

33:26.605 --> 33:28.307
You don't think Swan's
gonna give you up

33:28.340 --> 33:29.741
to get himself
a better deal?

33:29.775 --> 33:32.711
(Swan)
Why would I do that?

33:41.487 --> 33:44.156
Did he ask you to put
that kidney in Amy Solwey?

33:44.190 --> 33:45.624
He didn't.
It was my idea.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.726
I knew she needed
a transplant.

33:47.759 --> 33:50.796
You can arrest me now,
Detective.

33:50.829 --> 33:53.432
I'm ready to go.

34:07.213 --> 34:10.082
Detective Munch brought
you here tonight, didn't he?

34:10.116 --> 34:12.384
He is in a lot
of trouble.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.855
He did it for me.

34:16.888 --> 34:20.659
I would never
say that in court.

34:25.564 --> 34:28.234
Read my lips carefully.

34:28.267 --> 34:30.569
John Munch never came
to your apartment tonight.

34:30.602 --> 34:32.838
He never brought you here.

34:32.871 --> 34:36.842
In fact, you don't even know
where this place is.

34:36.875 --> 34:40.212
You got it?

34:43.915 --> 34:47.353
Yes.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.880
(Amy)
Detective Stabler.

35:20.519 --> 35:23.389
What are you doing here?

35:23.422 --> 35:26.692
[interpreter's voice]
Have you arrested
Mr. McGovern?

35:26.725 --> 35:29.595
Yes.

35:29.628 --> 35:32.464
What's going
to happen to him?

35:40.372 --> 35:42.641
Have to hand him over
to the FBI.

35:42.674 --> 35:43.842
He'll probably
go to prison.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.945
For trying to save
his son's life?

35:46.978 --> 35:49.515
Because he bought
that kidney.

35:49.548 --> 35:51.883
He had no choice.

35:51.917 --> 35:55.521
His son will die
without it.

35:57.389 --> 36:00.926
I know why he did it.

36:00.959 --> 36:05.364
But...

36:05.397 --> 36:08.400
There's nothing I can do.

36:08.434 --> 36:12.371
I gave you Dr. Swan's name,

36:12.404 --> 36:15.741
because I was afraid to die.

36:15.774 --> 36:18.844
If Kyle McGovern dies,

36:18.877 --> 36:22.681
I'll live with that
the rest of my life.

36:27.519 --> 36:31.257
[in own voice]
And so will you.

36:59.518 --> 37:01.720
It's time to go.

37:10.529 --> 37:12.264
Think we could stop
by the hospital

37:12.298 --> 37:13.632
on our way downtown?

37:22.073 --> 37:24.543
I can't.

37:24.576 --> 37:28.280
Kyle will panic if I'm
not there when he wakes up.

37:31.317 --> 37:33.919
I spoke with your wife.
She's at the hospital.

37:33.952 --> 37:36.522
You don't understand.

37:39.725 --> 37:43.895
When Kyle got sick,

37:43.929 --> 37:46.998
he asked me what happens
when you die.

37:50.369 --> 37:55.774
And I told him it was--

37:55.807 --> 37:58.043
I told him it was peaceful,
like going to sleep.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.849
And he was afraid to go to bed.

38:03.882 --> 38:05.784
So...

38:05.817 --> 38:09.555
so I promised him

38:09.588 --> 38:13.325
that I would be there
to wake him up.

38:15.894 --> 38:18.664
I have to be there.

38:24.970 --> 38:28.006
Please.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.996
Hey, Kyle.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.765
Your mom's in the cafeteria.

38:53.799 --> 38:56.835
Where's my Dad?

38:56.868 --> 39:00.639
He asked me to be here
when you woke up.

39:00.672 --> 39:04.410
Why didn't he come?

39:11.082 --> 39:13.585
Kyle, your dad loves you
very much.

39:13.619 --> 39:16.755
He'd do anything in the world
to make you well again.

39:16.788 --> 39:20.526
But--

39:20.559 --> 39:24.730
He did something wrong.

39:24.763 --> 39:28.600
Did he rob a bank
or something?

39:28.634 --> 39:31.136
No. No.

39:31.169 --> 39:34.105
Did he hurt anybody?

39:38.444 --> 39:42.914
He broke the law.

39:45.183 --> 39:48.119
He broke the law
to get you a kidney.

39:56.227 --> 39:59.030
He was just trying
to help you.

39:59.064 --> 40:01.833
So...

40:01.867 --> 40:04.436
why is that wrong?

40:24.022 --> 40:28.627
John, what you did
took a lot of balls.

40:28.660 --> 40:33.198
Yeah, well, I gotta
be able to sleep at night.

40:33.231 --> 40:35.767
Just came from the Federal
Court House.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.603
James McGovern
is pleading out.

40:37.636 --> 40:39.237
How much time
did he get?

40:39.270 --> 40:41.640
18 months.

40:41.673 --> 40:43.041
No one should have to choose
between obeying the law

40:43.074 --> 40:45.677
and watching
their child die.

40:45.711 --> 40:49.948
At least the judge postponed his
surrender date for six weeks.

40:49.981 --> 40:51.983
Then he gets to bury Kyle
before he goes to prison.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.519
No, John.
Maybe not.

40:53.552 --> 40:56.688
The NTCC moved Kyle up
to the top of the list.

40:56.722 --> 40:59.625
What about Amy?

41:02.160 --> 41:04.663
She just went
to the hospital.

41:04.696 --> 41:08.800
Kid on a motorcycle cracked up
doing 140 on the B.Q.E.

41:08.834 --> 41:12.170
Kidney's a match.

41:27.152 --> 41:28.520

Hello, John.

41:28.554 --> 41:30.756
Where are you going?

41:30.789 --> 41:32.257
Home.

41:32.290 --> 41:34.092
Something happen
to the kidney?

41:34.125 --> 41:35.561
I don't want it.

41:35.594 --> 41:36.962
Why not?

41:36.995 --> 41:40.198
Kyle McGovern's
gonna die.

41:40.231 --> 41:45.203
We'd both have a kidney
if it wasn't for me.

41:45.236 --> 41:49.207
If I turn it down,
it goes to him.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.543
You could die waiting
for the next one.

42:06.057 --> 42:10.061
I'll take my chances.

42:52.771 --> 42:55.006
