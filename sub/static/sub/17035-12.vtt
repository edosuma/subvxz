WEBVTT

00:04.648 --> 00:06.562
Ah, Mom, this is awesome.

00:06.564 --> 00:07.763
You never make ribs.

00:07.765 --> 00:09.165
Well, we had some extra,

00:09.167 --> 00:11.701
and I thought you might like to
eat something home-cooked.

00:11.703 --> 00:13.803
Well, home-reheated, actually.

00:13.805 --> 00:16.038
Are you really gonna let me
ride your motorcycle after this?

00:16.040 --> 00:17.873
Sure. Take it for a spin.

00:17.875 --> 00:19.809
And if you're still looking for
a chair for the 'Bago,

00:19.811 --> 00:21.644
we never use the one in Sue's anymore.

00:21.646 --> 00:24.146
Oh. This is the best dinner ever.

00:24.797 --> 00:28.184
So, son... How's school?

00:28.186 --> 00:31.220
Oh, my God.
This is a trap.

00:31.222 --> 00:33.155
You tricked me!
You just wanted to talk to me.

00:33.157 --> 00:34.457
It's a trick. It's a talk-trick.

00:34.459 --> 00:36.459
Well, I'm just gonna finish these ribs,

00:36.461 --> 00:37.993
ride your motorcycle, grab my chair,

00:37.995 --> 00:39.095
and then I'm out of here.

00:39.097 --> 00:40.529
Look, Axl...

00:40.531 --> 00:42.798
We don't want to put
any pressure on you,

00:42.800 --> 00:44.433
but we weren't sure if you realize

00:44.435 --> 00:45.868
you're graduating in four months,

00:45.870 --> 00:47.603
and we wanted to make sure
you're thinking about

00:47.605 --> 00:48.637
what you're gonna do with your life

00:48.639 --> 00:49.972
when those four months are up.

00:49.974 --> 00:51.974
Bill Norwood told me that his company

00:51.976 --> 00:54.376
is having interviews for
an entry-level position

00:54.378 --> 00:56.946
to do... whatever it is
his company does.

00:56.948 --> 00:58.114
And I can help you with your résumé.

00:58.116 --> 00:59.181
I've had lots of jobs,

00:59.183 --> 01:01.450
so I know all the best
action verbs to use.

01:01.452 --> 01:03.018
Oh, my God.

01:03.020 --> 01:05.187
For your information,
I'm already on it, okay?

01:05.188 --> 01:07.056
I got a résumé,
I'm going to the job fair,

01:07.058 --> 01:08.224
I got a haircut scheduled,

01:08.226 --> 01:09.892
I still got that tie
that Dad tied for me.

01:09.894 --> 01:11.660
So, look... I know your other kids

01:11.662 --> 01:13.662
didn't really live up to
your expectations,

01:13.664 --> 01:14.864
but trust me...

01:14.866 --> 01:16.699
- I got this.
- Well, that's great.

01:16.701 --> 01:18.601
I mean, I knew you were fine.

01:18.603 --> 01:20.102
Your dad was so worried.

01:23.406 --> 01:25.007
I can't believe this place...

01:25.009 --> 01:27.376
remote-control blinds,
automatic fire place,

01:27.378 --> 01:29.445
ice maker for cubes and crushed ice...

01:29.447 --> 01:30.746
It's amazing.

01:30.748 --> 01:32.915
No, it's not, Brad. It's horrible.

01:32.917 --> 01:34.683
All this opulence is turning me into

01:34.685 --> 01:36.318
someone I don't think I like.

01:36.630 --> 01:37.887
Then why are you smiling?

01:37.889 --> 01:40.356
I am so happy!

01:40.358 --> 01:41.390
Money does buy happiness...

01:41.392 --> 01:43.859
I don't want it to be true, but it is.

01:43.861 --> 01:45.628
Well, it's a good thing you had
a foundation of poorness

01:45.630 --> 01:47.129
so you can really appreciate all this.

01:47.131 --> 01:47.975
Mm.

01:48.566 --> 01:50.266
Oh. Is that the time? I got to go.

01:50.268 --> 01:52.234
I've got no-cut a cappella practice.

01:52.236 --> 01:54.036
We're competing at "Hot Dragon Nights."

01:54.038 --> 01:55.738
Uh... So you want to hit a movie after?

01:55.740 --> 01:57.773
Breakfast? Brunch? Dinner?
Early-morning run?

01:57.775 --> 02:00.743
Brad, your calendar seems a little open.

02:00.745 --> 02:01.844
Is everything okay?

02:01.846 --> 02:03.145
Yeah, I'm fine.

02:03.147 --> 02:04.780
Leaving NYU and coming to East Indy...

02:04.782 --> 02:06.148
It's been an adjustment, that's all...

02:06.150 --> 02:07.850
still trying to see where Brad fits in.

02:07.852 --> 02:09.785
Oh, I'm sorry. Okay, look...

02:09.787 --> 02:11.921
We can definitely talk about
this more when I get back.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.989
But till then, please, stay, enjoy.

02:13.991 --> 02:16.091
Check out the
smart toilet in the bathroom.

02:16.093 --> 02:17.126
I didn't know it,

02:17.128 --> 02:19.728
but our toilets at home were so dumb.

02:24.201 --> 02:25.601
Brad, what am I thinking?

02:25.603 --> 02:26.802
I hope you're thinking
I should come with you

02:26.804 --> 02:28.170
to no-cut a cappella.

02:33.411 --> 02:36.078
Well, Cindy and I are having troubles.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.313
- Oh, good. Your mom's here.
- Oh, good. Your dad's here.

02:37.315 --> 02:38.447
N... It's you, Mike.

02:38.449 --> 02:40.916
It's a boy coming to his dad
with woman problems.

02:40.918 --> 02:42.251
No, it's you.

02:42.253 --> 02:45.087
He needs help with a girl,
and you were once a girl.

02:45.089 --> 02:46.355
You know the drill...

02:46.357 --> 02:48.023
You got to deal with the same
gendered child's problems.

02:48.025 --> 02:49.391
Well, how's that fair?

02:49.393 --> 02:51.026
Then I got to deal with
twice as many problems as you.

02:51.028 --> 02:53.229
It's refreshing to see
my parents fighting so much

02:53.231 --> 02:54.686
to get out of helping me.

02:56.367 --> 02:59.268
Cindy says
I spend too much time reading.

02:59.606 --> 03:01.103
How long you two been dating?

03:01.414 --> 03:03.239
- Three years.
- Oh, yeah...

03:03.241 --> 03:05.674
You still got years of
compromise ahead of you.

03:05.676 --> 03:07.443
You got to lay a lot of groundwork

03:07.445 --> 03:08.844
before you reach the point where we are,

03:08.846 --> 03:10.212
where nobody cares.

03:10.214 --> 03:13.015
Then, when you stop caring,
you're in the sweet spot

03:13.017 --> 03:15.317
where you get to back to doing
whatever you want to do again.

03:15.319 --> 03:16.652
And, sure, you'll still have spurts

03:16.654 --> 03:18.320
where you think you want
to do things together,

03:18.322 --> 03:21.323
but when you do... never as good
as it was in your mind.

03:21.325 --> 03:23.826
Wait... You're saying
I have to just suck it up

03:23.828 --> 03:24.860
and do what she wants?

03:24.862 --> 03:27.997
Now you do, if the goal is this.

03:31.435 --> 03:33.502
Guys, big news...

03:33.504 --> 03:37.072
My friend Brad Bottig
has agreed to join our group.

03:37.074 --> 03:39.375
You know we needed another
singer for the boy parts,

03:39.377 --> 03:43.012
and Brad comes to us directly from NYU.

03:43.014 --> 03:45.314
Not Northern Yukon...
The one in New York City.

03:45.316 --> 03:47.182
- Oh, my God.
- Wow. -Whoa!

03:47.184 --> 03:48.284
Look, I know you guys are already

03:48.286 --> 03:50.119
deep into practices
for Hot Dragon Nights,

03:50.121 --> 03:51.754
but I'm not here to derail the train,

03:51.756 --> 03:53.188
just help the train down the tracks.

03:53.190 --> 03:54.890
Uh, know anything about choreography?

03:54.892 --> 03:56.592
Oh, you tell me.

03:56.594 --> 03:57.826
Five, six, seven.

04:00.063 --> 04:01.664
- Whoa!
- Wow!

04:01.666 --> 04:02.831
What about costumes?

04:02.833 --> 04:04.333
I made a Technicolor dreamcoat.

04:04.335 --> 04:05.401
Oh, for Joseph?

04:05.403 --> 04:06.502
No.

04:06.504 --> 04:08.137
Wow.

04:08.139 --> 04:09.738
Would you consider being our leader?

04:09.740 --> 04:12.408
Well, I wouldn't want to
step on your leader's toes.

04:12.410 --> 04:13.776
There are no toes. We have no leader.

04:13.778 --> 04:15.077
All in favor of Brad leading us?

04:15.079 --> 04:16.178
Aye!

04:16.180 --> 04:17.680
Oh, my God.

04:17.682 --> 04:20.582
To go from nothing to president
of no-cut a cappella...

04:20.584 --> 04:22.084
I love East Indy so much!

04:22.086 --> 04:23.852
All right, well, obviously,
I need to get caught up,

04:23.854 --> 04:25.621
so show me what you've been working on.

04:27.290 --> 04:28.324
Wow me.

04:28.326 --> 04:30.192
Five, six, seven...

04:32.000 --> 04:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:41.405 --> 04:42.765
Wow.

04:49.079 --> 04:51.347
Hey, excuse me... The line's back there.

04:59.782 --> 05:01.550
Didn't think it'd be so crowded.

05:01.552 --> 05:02.651
I mean, what's the rush?

05:02.653 --> 05:04.720
We got a whole four months
till graduation.

05:04.722 --> 05:07.256
Four months? We're juniors.

05:07.258 --> 05:09.124
Pfft.

05:09.126 --> 05:11.860
Check it out. These dorks are juniors.

05:11.862 --> 05:13.128
Yeah, we're all juniors.

05:13.130 --> 05:14.229
What?

05:14.231 --> 05:16.198
Seriously, if you're not
on an employer's radar

05:16.200 --> 05:18.567
by your junior year, you are screwed.

05:18.569 --> 05:19.601
Whaaaat?

05:19.603 --> 05:22.204
That can't be true, can it?

05:22.206 --> 05:23.939
My brother graduated with an MBA.

05:23.941 --> 05:25.574
Now he lives in my parents' basement.

05:25.576 --> 05:26.597
Mm.

05:26.599 --> 05:30.045
So, any idea where
the senior line might be?

05:30.047 --> 05:31.847
Hah... It's called
the unemployment line.

05:31.849 --> 05:33.115
Oh, come on.

05:33.117 --> 05:34.416
You can't all be juniors.

05:34.418 --> 05:35.684
- I'm not.
- Thank you.

05:35.686 --> 05:36.826
I'm a sophomore.

05:37.755 --> 05:38.887
Let's go!

05:38.889 --> 05:40.556
We're storming the campus career center!

05:40.558 --> 05:41.990
Wait... We're doing what now?

05:41.992 --> 05:43.225
I was just at the job fair,

05:43.227 --> 05:45.194
and there was a bunch of
juniors out there.

05:45.196 --> 05:48.363
Juniors! They're taking all
the seniors' jobs... our jobs!

05:48.365 --> 05:50.699
Look, don't drag me into this.
I already got a job.

05:50.701 --> 05:52.034
Since when?

05:52.036 --> 05:53.202
Do you ever listen to me?

05:53.204 --> 05:54.503
Remember? I told you...

05:54.505 --> 05:57.039
Johnson, Walian and Blum
snapped me up last year.

05:57.041 --> 05:58.907
They're even paying for me to
go to grad school, too.

05:58.909 --> 06:00.242
That's not fair.

06:00.244 --> 06:02.244
An engineering job and grad school?

06:02.246 --> 06:04.480
You're taking up two spots.
Why didn't you guys tell me

06:04.482 --> 06:06.281
I had to start job hunting junior year?

06:06.283 --> 06:08.584
Hutch, I can see you
not saying anything, but Kenny?

06:08.586 --> 06:09.752
Hey, I tried to get you to go with me

06:09.754 --> 06:11.353
to that job-hunting workshop last year,

06:11.355 --> 06:14.389
and you said, and I quote,
"Nah, it's cold."

06:14.391 --> 06:16.158
Well, not as cold as it is now!

06:16.160 --> 06:18.293
Ah... Kenny, maybe we can
throw in together, huh...

06:18.295 --> 06:21.096
start BossCo Two or maybe
try to get hired as a team?

06:21.098 --> 06:22.598
Kenny doesn't need a job.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.666
He's made some serious bank
designing and selling apps.

06:24.668 --> 06:26.335
He's just a couple years away
from retirement.

06:26.337 --> 06:27.571
Have you seen his net worth?

06:28.526 --> 06:30.158
Oh, my God.

06:30.160 --> 06:31.626
Kenny, are you hiring?

06:31.628 --> 06:33.228
I was, 12 months ago.

06:33.230 --> 06:34.896
I am so screwed!

06:34.898 --> 06:37.232
I thought I was finally on top
of something, but I'm not.

06:37.234 --> 06:38.934
You know, this is so not my fault.

06:38.936 --> 06:40.502
This is the college's fault.

06:40.504 --> 06:42.804
I would not want to be
East Indiana State right now,

06:42.806 --> 06:45.006
'cause I'm gonna go out there
and be a big failure,

06:45.008 --> 06:47.576
and it's gonna look so bad on them.

06:50.194 --> 06:51.413
Turn.

06:51.415 --> 06:52.547
Really?

06:52.549 --> 06:54.416
'Cause I'm a fast reader,
and I'm not even done,

06:54.418 --> 06:55.951
and I've read this book before.

06:55.953 --> 06:56.985
Turn.

06:56.987 --> 06:59.421
But you have to breathe the words in.

06:59.423 --> 07:01.590
Let them roll around
in your head and savor the...

07:01.592 --> 07:02.624
Turn.

07:05.229 --> 07:06.895
Why are we doing this again?

07:06.897 --> 07:08.697
You said you wanted to
spend more time with me,

07:08.699 --> 07:10.031
and I didn't want to give up reading,

07:10.033 --> 07:12.267
so my parents suggested we compromise.

07:12.269 --> 07:13.935
So I thought we'd read a book together.

07:15.038 --> 07:18.106
Hey, Tweedle-Weird and Tweedle-Weirder.

07:18.108 --> 07:20.475
You know, there's better things
to do on that couch than read?

07:20.477 --> 07:22.043
Just floating that out there.

07:22.912 --> 07:23.945
Turn.

07:26.849 --> 07:29.384
Oh, hey, Axl. What are you doing home?

07:29.386 --> 07:31.286
Oh, you didn't get sick
from those ribs, too, did you?

07:31.288 --> 07:33.255
That is the last time
I buy ribs at a garage sale.

07:33.257 --> 07:34.422
I knew it was too good to be true.

07:34.424 --> 07:36.191
No, no, I'm fine. Fine.

07:36.193 --> 07:40.061
I thought I'd just come by,
say hi, relax, see the fam.

07:40.063 --> 07:41.696
So, how's work?

07:41.698 --> 07:42.964
- Fine.
- Same old, same old.

07:42.966 --> 07:44.299
That's cool.

07:44.301 --> 07:47.302
Um, Dad, you know that
Mr. Norwood job you mentioned?

07:47.304 --> 07:48.804
God, I was thinking, pfft,

07:48.806 --> 07:51.640
it'd be really bad if he wanted
to interview me and I said no,

07:51.642 --> 07:53.275
you guys being friends and all.

07:53.277 --> 07:55.644
Don't worry about it.
I know you got a lot going on.

07:55.646 --> 07:57.345
Right. Right.

07:57.347 --> 07:58.547
Oh!

07:58.549 --> 08:00.115
Hey, Mom, you want me
to stir this for you?

08:00.117 --> 08:01.216
That's not food!

08:01.218 --> 08:02.417
I'm boiling your dad's work socks.

08:03.754 --> 08:06.822
But, still, you know, it was
so nice of Mr. Norwood to offer.

08:06.824 --> 08:08.523
I should at least meet with him, right,

08:08.525 --> 08:10.525
for the interview practice?
I'll give him a call.

08:10.527 --> 08:13.361
Oh, and, Dad, I may need you to
tie another tie for me,

08:13.363 --> 08:15.831
'cause I ruined the other one
playing pirates with Hutch.

08:18.301 --> 08:19.673
So, there was a reason

08:19.698 --> 08:21.636
no-cut a cappella was no-cut.

08:21.638 --> 08:23.505
They were terrible.

08:23.507 --> 08:24.639
Yeah...

08:24.641 --> 08:26.842
But that just made Brad more determined.

08:26.844 --> 08:28.610
- And... and...
- He worked 'em morning...

08:28.612 --> 08:30.679
- ...and don't forget to smile!
- ...he worked 'em night...

08:30.681 --> 08:32.780
- One, two, three, four...
- Until finally...

08:45.137 --> 08:46.795
Footsteps even lighter... Ohh!

08:46.797 --> 08:49.297
Okay, okay, okay... let's stop there.

08:49.299 --> 08:51.166
Was that better? That felt better.

08:51.168 --> 08:52.834
Well, with seven weeks
to the competition,

08:52.836 --> 08:54.002
I think we'll be okay.

08:54.004 --> 08:55.570
It's this Friday.

08:55.572 --> 08:58.006
Even better.

09:02.615 --> 09:04.674
Hi. We'd like to sign up
for Hot Dragon Nights.

09:04.699 --> 09:06.498
Our group is called The Duly Noted.

09:06.500 --> 09:08.534
Are you a sorority or a fraternity?

09:08.536 --> 09:10.736
Oh, neither... We're
the no-cut a cappella group.

09:11.406 --> 09:13.372
I'm sorry, but this is
just for real groups.

09:13.374 --> 09:15.507
Don't get me wrong...
You no-cut people are fine

09:15.509 --> 09:16.875
for signing at the old-folks' home

09:16.877 --> 09:19.044
or caroling at the gate
of the outdoor pool,

09:19.046 --> 09:21.747
but this is a very serious competition.

09:21.749 --> 09:24.416
Excuse me...
Where in your bylaws does it say

09:24.418 --> 09:25.784
no-cut groups can't enter?

09:25.786 --> 09:28.187
Oh, it does... I imagine.

09:28.189 --> 09:30.322
But just to make sure, I'll check.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.493
You know, Sue, there's something
we haven't thought of

09:34.495 --> 09:36.295
that might make
no-cut a cappella better.

09:36.297 --> 09:37.496
- What?
- Cuts.

09:38.799 --> 09:41.200
Brad, we are no-cut a cappella.

09:41.202 --> 09:43.035
"No-cut" is right there in the name.

09:43.037 --> 09:44.570
I'm sorry, but Chase is tone-deaf.

09:44.572 --> 09:45.904
And Hannah... I don't know
what she's doing,

09:45.906 --> 09:47.239
but it ain't dance steps.

09:47.241 --> 09:49.441
Without those two,
we might have a fighting chance.

09:49.443 --> 09:50.976
Look, Brad... I don't know
if you remember

09:50.978 --> 09:53.579
how painful high school was, but I do.

09:53.581 --> 09:55.314
We have to stay no-cut.

09:55.316 --> 09:57.316
There has to be a place for people

09:57.318 --> 09:59.451
who are only mildly interested
in things.

09:59.453 --> 10:01.787
Oh, you're right.
Oh, what was I thinking?

10:01.789 --> 10:04.390
Wow. Six weeks in New York
really darkened my soul.

10:04.392 --> 10:07.192
Once you've seen a rat with half
of another rat in its mouth,

10:07.194 --> 10:08.560
it hardens you.

10:09.131 --> 10:10.969
Well, it looks like

10:10.971 --> 10:13.300
there's nothing specific
against no-cut groups.

10:13.302 --> 10:15.736
Apparently, common sense
has ruled up until now.

10:15.803 --> 10:19.038
But if Dully Noted wants to
perform, I can't stop you.

10:19.040 --> 10:20.206
It's "Duly."

10:20.208 --> 10:21.495
We'll see about that.

10:25.045 --> 10:27.146
"The lights grow brighter

10:27.148 --> 10:29.592
as the Earth lurches away from the sun,

10:30.084 --> 10:31.918
and now the orchestra
is playing yellow"...

10:31.920 --> 10:33.519
She's stressing the wrong words!

10:33.521 --> 10:35.521
I didn't hear that sentence. Go back.

10:35.523 --> 10:36.856
En...

10:38.192 --> 10:40.633
I just don't get how you can
"listen" to a book.

10:40.694 --> 10:43.127
There's no fonts to look at,
there's no paper to touch.

10:43.129 --> 10:44.896
They've removed two of the senses,

10:44.898 --> 10:47.598
and the truth is sometimes
I lick them, so that's three.

10:47.600 --> 10:48.933
I don't like this either.

10:48.935 --> 10:51.269
I'm just doing it for you,
because you won't give up books.

10:51.271 --> 10:53.938
What if I asked you
to give up shrimp?

10:53.940 --> 10:55.339
Now you've made it ugly.

10:55.341 --> 10:57.909
I'm just saying... If you love someone,

10:57.911 --> 11:00.411
you shouldn't make them do
something they don't want to do.

11:00.413 --> 11:03.481
Books are my life.
You can't expect me to give up

11:03.483 --> 11:04.849
something that's such a part of me.

11:04.851 --> 11:05.978
Fine.

11:05.980 --> 11:08.786
The truth is the audio book
wasn't working for me either.

11:08.788 --> 11:10.354
I'm not really into books.

11:10.356 --> 11:12.056
I'm more into fashion.

11:12.058 --> 11:13.658
Well, except for "Planet Nowhere."

11:13.660 --> 11:14.826
Never read it.

11:14.828 --> 11:17.328
What?! How have we never
talked about this?

11:17.330 --> 11:18.429
You were reading.

11:18.431 --> 11:19.797
Wh... You have to read it!

11:19.799 --> 11:22.066
How else are we gonna have
a "Planet Nowhere" wedding?

11:22.068 --> 11:23.601
When I hand you the Branch of Truth,

11:23.603 --> 11:24.936
you're not gonna know what to do!

11:24.938 --> 11:26.337
You don't want to look like an idiot.

11:26.339 --> 11:28.740
Aren't you getting
a little ahead of yourself?

11:28.742 --> 11:31.275
Look, "Planet Nowhere" speaks to me.

11:31.277 --> 11:33.377
If you don't know those books,
you don't know me.

11:33.379 --> 11:36.520
Please, just... read the first chapter.

11:36.916 --> 11:39.283
Fine. I'll read them for you.

11:39.285 --> 11:40.451
But I better like it,

11:40.453 --> 11:42.420
or you'll be getting
the Branch of Truth.

11:45.491 --> 11:47.759
Hey, Axl! How's it going?

11:47.761 --> 11:49.160
Mr. Norwood. I'm good.

11:49.162 --> 11:50.072
Yeah.

11:51.420 --> 11:54.332
So, tell me where you're from.

11:55.401 --> 11:57.168
I'm just kidding, man.
Thanks for coming in.

11:57.170 --> 11:58.970
Well, uh, yeah.
Thanks for meeting with me.

11:58.972 --> 12:00.638
Yeah. Seems like just yesterday you were

12:00.640 --> 12:03.007
popping wheelies past my house
and now here you are,

12:03.009 --> 12:04.575
looking for a job.

12:04.577 --> 12:07.378
Yeah, well, uh, it's never
too early to start looking.

12:07.380 --> 12:09.847
- Yeah.
- Really... never too early.

12:09.849 --> 12:11.315
I, uh, graduate in four months,

12:11.317 --> 12:14.385
but, you know, I started
the job search way before this.

12:14.387 --> 12:17.155
Oh, you got to.
It is so competitive out there.

12:17.157 --> 12:18.616
- Yeah.
- Hey, let me ask you

12:18.641 --> 12:20.254
a really important question.

12:20.660 --> 12:23.094
Does your dad ever wear those
sunglasses that I got him?

12:23.927 --> 12:24.929
What?

12:24.931 --> 12:26.030
No! You know what, never mind.

12:26.032 --> 12:27.549
It's... forget about it.

12:27.551 --> 12:29.300
Let's take a look at this résumé, huh?

12:30.486 --> 12:31.869
Wow, they're really good.

12:31.871 --> 12:33.671
And nobody's tripped once.

12:33.673 --> 12:37.408
Okay, sure, they're phenomenal

12:37.410 --> 12:39.844
like Josh Groban and Beyoncé had a baby

12:39.846 --> 12:41.312
and it was this group.

12:41.314 --> 12:43.080
But we're good, too!

12:44.551 --> 12:45.716
Is that a back handspring?

12:45.718 --> 12:47.585
Oh, my God.
Why do we have to follow them?

12:47.587 --> 12:50.188
Ugh. I wish we were the group after us.

12:55.828 --> 12:57.929
I've never been more nervous in my life.

12:57.931 --> 13:00.665
If she doesn't like it,
where does that leave us?

13:00.667 --> 13:03.401
I can't be with someone who
doesn't love "Planet Nowhere."

13:03.403 --> 13:05.536
What are the odds of you
finding another girl

13:05.538 --> 13:07.805
who likes you and "Planet Nowhere"?

13:07.807 --> 13:09.340
You're really threading
the needle here, buddy.

13:09.342 --> 13:13.945
Check it out. I crushed it at
my interview with Mr. Norwood,

13:13.947 --> 13:16.514
so I celebrated by
buying myself some work duds.

13:16.516 --> 13:18.182
Oh, look...

13:18.184 --> 13:19.817
It's half past "I'm awesome."

13:21.154 --> 13:23.821
You bought new work clothes
before you got the job?

13:23.823 --> 13:25.990
You don't buy a suit
for the job you have.

13:25.992 --> 13:29.627
You buy a suit for whatever job
Mr. Norwood's company does.

13:29.629 --> 13:32.163
Well, don't Heck it up.
The job's not yours yet.

13:32.165 --> 13:33.231
Oh, it will be.

13:33.233 --> 13:34.899
When I go after something, I get it.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.267
Lifeguarding... "Here's your whistle."

13:36.269 --> 13:37.902
Movie theater... "Welcome to show biz."

13:37.904 --> 13:39.503
Little Betty? Meet Big Axl.

13:40.740 --> 13:42.940
Oh, God! What does that mean?!

13:42.942 --> 13:46.177
Relax. She probably just hit the
chair cushion and dust flew up.

13:46.179 --> 13:48.579
If she loves "Planet Nowhere,"
then I can love her.

13:48.581 --> 13:50.281
But if she only likes it
then I can only like her,

13:50.283 --> 13:51.816
because I love it,
and she only likes it.

13:51.818 --> 13:53.217
Oh, but if she loved it

13:53.219 --> 13:55.152
and I loved her, that would be
the best love of all!

13:55.154 --> 13:56.487
But what if she hates it?

13:56.489 --> 13:59.123
Ohh... Oh, my stomach
is so twisted around.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.846
I got to lie down.

14:05.764 --> 14:09.100
Oh! H-Hey, Mr. Norwood.
You want to come in?

14:09.102 --> 14:10.134
Um, that's okay.

14:10.136 --> 14:11.402
I got to head home for dinner.

14:11.404 --> 14:13.537
Paula bought these ribs
at a garage sale, so...

14:13.539 --> 14:16.974
Anyhoo, I wanted to stop by
and tell you in person...

14:16.976 --> 14:19.810
Unfortunately, we had to
give the job to somebody else.

14:19.812 --> 14:21.479
Not my decision...

14:21.481 --> 14:23.981
The other guy just...
just had more experience.

14:23.983 --> 14:25.950
I just wanted to let you know
you did great.

14:25.952 --> 14:27.818
I mean, really impressive.

14:27.820 --> 14:29.921
The guys upstairs are gonna be
kicking themselves

14:29.923 --> 14:31.289
for not snatching you up.

14:31.291 --> 14:33.057
Well, thanks. I appreciate that.

14:33.059 --> 14:34.859
And, hey, thank you
for letting me know in person.

14:34.861 --> 14:37.028
Of course. Sure you're okay?

14:37.030 --> 14:38.963
Oh, yeah. I'm all good.
These things happen.

14:38.965 --> 14:40.965
You're not gonna get every job
you go out for.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.667
Yeah, your dad told me how many
things you got lined up,

14:42.669 --> 14:44.602
so I know you'll be fine.

14:44.604 --> 14:46.070
All right, take care, buddy.

14:46.072 --> 14:48.839
Hey, by the way, love the treads.

14:48.841 --> 14:50.908
Thanks.

14:52.678 --> 14:54.679
I didn't get it, Mommy!

14:54.681 --> 14:56.480
Oh, God, I'm the worst!

14:56.482 --> 14:58.182
I suck! Ugh!

14:58.184 --> 15:00.051
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.

15:00.053 --> 15:01.252
So you didn't get this job.

15:01.254 --> 15:03.387
You've got all those other irons
in the fire.

15:03.389 --> 15:06.090
I lied! There's no fire!

15:06.092 --> 15:07.358
There's no irons!

15:07.360 --> 15:09.327
I was supposed to start
job hunting a year ago,

15:09.329 --> 15:11.595
and now I'm graduating in May,
and I've got nothing...

15:11.597 --> 15:13.097
nothing but amazing hair.

15:13.099 --> 15:14.465
God, why can't that be enough?

15:14.467 --> 15:17.068
Dad, you need a better friend.
I hate Bill Norwood.

15:17.070 --> 15:18.703
You're taking this really well.

15:18.705 --> 15:21.138
Ohh! I got no job prospects!

15:21.140 --> 15:24.475
Wait a second... I could
take over the diaper business.

15:24.477 --> 15:26.377
I have a job. It's perfect.

15:27.779 --> 15:29.413
Uh, did we not tell him?

15:29.415 --> 15:31.849
Here's the thing, Axl.
You haven't been around a lot.

15:31.851 --> 15:33.284
I sold the business.

15:33.286 --> 15:34.518
What?

15:34.520 --> 15:36.387
I was supposed to be a diaper heiress.

15:36.389 --> 15:37.888
You wouldn't be an heiress.

15:37.890 --> 15:39.223
Well, not now.

15:39.225 --> 15:40.825
At least I'll get to
keep some of the money.

15:40.827 --> 15:42.259
We spent it on Sue.

15:42.261 --> 15:44.261
Oh, G...

15:44.263 --> 15:46.998
Stupid watch! Stupid vest!

15:47.000 --> 15:48.399
Nope, don't need these anymore,

15:48.401 --> 15:49.900
'cause I'm not going anywhere.

15:49.902 --> 15:51.869
- Honey, don't take your clothes off.
- No!

15:51.871 --> 15:54.105
These clothes are for winners,
and I am a loser.

15:54.107 --> 15:55.373
God! You know what?

15:55.375 --> 15:57.341
Just face it. I peaked in high school.

15:57.343 --> 15:59.176
I'm nothing but a boxer-short-wearing,

15:59.178 --> 16:01.045
messy-haired divorcé!

16:01.047 --> 16:03.581
I'll just park my 'Bago in
the driveway and live out there.

16:03.583 --> 16:05.516
So, you really don't have
anything else going on,

16:05.518 --> 16:08.152
no résumés anywhere, no leads,
no job possibilities?

16:08.154 --> 16:09.854
Oh, Dad, make her stop!

16:10.167 --> 16:11.989
I'm sorry. I'm making it worse.

16:11.991 --> 16:14.425
Boy problem.
Let me know when it's fixed.

16:17.663 --> 16:19.096
Come on. Get up.

16:20.299 --> 16:22.366
Okay, so you hit a bump.

16:22.368 --> 16:23.801
You're gonna be fine.

16:23.803 --> 16:25.936
You always find a way to
make things work out for you.

16:25.938 --> 16:27.464
You said so yourself.

16:27.740 --> 16:29.140
And you're a social guy.

16:29.142 --> 16:32.176
You got your mom's thing
of actually liking people.

16:32.178 --> 16:34.445
No, but that's the problem.
I'm too social.

16:34.447 --> 16:35.546
I needed to be more like you...

16:35.548 --> 16:37.348
a solid, strong, good provider.

16:37.350 --> 16:38.916
But I-I'll never be able to do that.

16:38.918 --> 16:40.484
I'm a freakin' mess. I'm done.

16:40.486 --> 16:42.720
You're 22. You're not done.

16:42.722 --> 16:45.022
Trust me, life is gonna
kick you around a lot,

16:45.024 --> 16:47.358
so you might not want to
tear off all your clothes

16:47.360 --> 16:50.134
and flop around on the floor
every time you hit a setback.

16:50.696 --> 16:52.029
Especially this floor.

16:52.031 --> 16:53.564
Well, that's easy for you to say.

16:53.566 --> 16:55.466
You've always been, like,
super responsible.

16:55.837 --> 16:58.069
Well, I don't know about that.

16:58.071 --> 17:01.072
I... I remember one time
when I was about your age,

17:01.074 --> 17:02.673
maybe a little older.

17:02.675 --> 17:04.575
I had an interview for this job

17:04.577 --> 17:07.044
at a, uh, roofing-supply company,

17:07.046 --> 17:09.246
and I really needed this job.

17:09.248 --> 17:12.016
I was totally broke,
even more broke than we are.

17:12.018 --> 17:13.250
- Whoa.
- Yeah.

17:13.252 --> 17:16.820
So I went in there,
all prepared, and I nailed it.

17:16.823 --> 17:20.357
And I was so pumped when I came
out that I got in my Chevette,

17:20.358 --> 17:21.659
and I cranked up the tunes,

17:21.661 --> 17:23.861
and I did a bunch of donuts
in the parking lot.

17:24.896 --> 17:26.597
And then I look up to the window,

17:26.598 --> 17:29.433
and there's the two guys
that had just interviewed me

17:29.435 --> 17:31.635
staring down at me
and shaking their heads.

17:33.371 --> 17:34.939
So you didn't get the job.

17:34.941 --> 17:36.340
I don't know. I never heard back.

17:36.342 --> 17:39.610
But a few weeks later,
I interviewed at the quarry,

17:39.612 --> 17:42.546
and this time, I made sure to
pull out of that parking lot

17:42.548 --> 17:44.582
like an old grandpa.

17:44.994 --> 17:48.552
Point is, things kind of
have a way of working out.

17:48.900 --> 17:51.522
So, was the donut thing
the only time you screwed up?

17:51.524 --> 17:55.326
It's the only one you need to
know about for now.

17:58.964 --> 18:00.998
I'm sorry. I can't take it any longer.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.233
My life is hanging in the balance.

18:02.235 --> 18:03.267
I got to know!

18:05.972 --> 18:07.505
She gave me the finger.

18:07.895 --> 18:09.340
She loves it!

18:15.715 --> 18:18.449
Okay. We're up.

18:18.451 --> 18:20.885
And that was
the Greek-Appellas.

18:20.887 --> 18:23.354
Let's give it up one more time for 'em.

18:23.356 --> 18:25.422
I can't do this!

18:25.424 --> 18:27.191
What? Chase, no! What do you mean?

18:27.193 --> 18:29.193
I don't belong here. I'm not a singer.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.061
I'm only mildly interested
in a cappella.

18:31.063 --> 18:32.863
Really? Aw, that's disappointing.

18:32.865 --> 18:34.231
But I get it if you have to go.

18:34.233 --> 18:35.399
All right, everybody else, fill in.

18:35.401 --> 18:37.835
Uh, if Chase isn't doing it,
I can't do it.

18:37.837 --> 18:39.103
He's better than I am.

18:39.105 --> 18:40.437
Aw, no. You, too, Hannah?

18:40.439 --> 18:42.173
Oh, well. Everyone,
let's thank Chase and Hannah

18:42.175 --> 18:43.474
for all their hard work.

18:43.476 --> 18:45.109
Now, fill in, fill in.

18:45.111 --> 18:48.345
Well, if they're leaving,
I want to go, too.

18:48.347 --> 18:50.281
No, no, no, you can't all quit!

18:50.283 --> 18:51.815
I mean, Chase and Hannah,
you guys still can,

18:51.817 --> 18:54.185
'cause you were first,
but, everyone else, come on.

18:54.187 --> 18:55.819
It doesn't matter if
the other teams are good.

18:55.821 --> 18:56.921
We have spirit and heart,

18:56.923 --> 18:58.155
and that counts for more than talent.

18:58.157 --> 19:00.057
Yeah, you guys,
come on. You can't quit.

19:00.059 --> 19:01.825
I had to fight for us to be
in this competition.

19:01.827 --> 19:03.494
What? They didn't want us?

19:03.496 --> 19:05.429
Well...
I'm not making a fool of myself.

19:05.431 --> 19:07.097
I invited a girl I like to this!

19:07.099 --> 19:08.499
No, you should...

19:08.501 --> 19:10.334
Wait, guys! Come back!

19:10.336 --> 19:13.437
Ladies and gentlemen,
Dully Noted!

19:47.506 --> 19:49.406
You suck!

19:49.408 --> 19:51.275
- You guys stink!
- You suck!

19:51.277 --> 19:53.410
Boo, boo, boo, boo!

19:53.412 --> 19:55.179
- Boo, boo, boo, boo!
- You guys suck!

19:55.181 --> 19:57.448
You suck,
you suck, you suck!

19:57.450 --> 19:59.283
You suck, you suck, you suck!

19:59.285 --> 20:01.185
You suck,
you suck, you suck!

20:01.187 --> 20:03.087
- Boo!
- You suck, you suck, you suck!

20:03.089 --> 20:04.955
- Boo!
- You suck, you suck, you suck!

20:04.957 --> 20:06.257
Boo!

20:36.789 --> 20:38.756
You suck,
you suck, you suck...

20:48.146 --> 20:50.147
- What part are you...
- Shh.

20:50.149 --> 20:52.116
Boy, they found
their sweet spot early, huh?

20:52.118 --> 20:53.317
Good for them.

20:53.319 --> 20:55.586
You know, I was gonna go with Nancy

20:55.588 --> 20:58.322
to check out this ice-sculpture
demonstration at the mall,

20:58.324 --> 20:59.690
but I can cancel it,

20:59.692 --> 21:01.725
and we can do something together
if you want.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.961
Nah. I don't really want to.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.696
Good, 'cause I didn't really
want to cancel.

21:05.698 --> 21:07.665
But what matters is
we still pretend to care.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.366
I'll never stop pretending, baby.

21:09.368 --> 21:10.968
Shh!
