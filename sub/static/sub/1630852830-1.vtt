WEBVTT

00:53.000 --> 00:56.458
-(lively chatter)

01:02.125 --> 01:04.625
…down hard,
and I swallowed really quickly,

01:04.708 --> 01:07.000
and half the mozzarella stick
got lodged, (grunts)

01:07.083 --> 01:09.375
and the other one was still in my hand
with the connecting cheese,

01:09.458 --> 01:10.708
and I had to have the Heimlich.

01:10.791 --> 01:12.875
It was, like…
ruined the whole bat mitzvah.

01:12.958 --> 01:14.875
Hi. Can I get another
Lover's Punch, please?

01:14.958 --> 01:16.291
-Mm-hmm.
-Thank you.

01:16.375 --> 01:18.125
Mmm. Mmm-mmm-mmm.

01:18.208 --> 01:19.625
These pancakes are bonkers.

01:19.708 --> 01:21.666
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm.

01:21.750 --> 01:23.458
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

01:23.541 --> 01:25.208
Have some of my steak.

01:25.291 --> 01:27.250
-Great source of iron.
-Thank you, baby.

01:27.333 --> 01:29.875
And, you know, you can
cook this at home really easily.

01:29.958 --> 01:34.000
So you should do it a lot 'cause you never
remember to take your iron pills.

01:34.083 --> 01:36.500
And your levels are… are really low.

01:36.583 --> 01:37.750
Okay, what is this?

01:37.833 --> 01:41.416
Like, are you trying to be the cutest,
sweetest, nicest boyfriend in the world?

01:41.500 --> 01:44.166
Because… you're really winning.

01:46.666 --> 01:48.625
Emma, I'm breaking up with you.

01:49.708 --> 01:50.916
(coughing)

01:51.000 --> 01:52.625
(clearing throat)

01:52.708 --> 01:54.250
-Lover's Punch? Mm-hmm.
-(coughing): Thank you.

01:54.333 --> 01:56.333
(clearing throat)

01:56.416 --> 01:57.583
(coughs)

01:57.666 --> 01:58.833
(clearing throat)

01:58.916 --> 02:00.416
-You okay?
-I want to spit it out.

02:00.500 --> 02:02.250
-(kids clamoring, screaming)

02:02.333 --> 02:05.166
(Peter roaring playfully)

02:05.250 --> 02:08.916
I'm a hungry monster,
and I eat birthday boys!

02:09.000 --> 02:10.833
(laughter)

02:10.916 --> 02:13.125
-Mom, you did a great job, really.
-Aw, thank you, honey.

02:13.208 --> 02:14.958
I'm glad you like it.
Everything for Toby, you know.

02:15.041 --> 02:16.291
(both chuckle)

02:16.375 --> 02:19.875
That little boyfriend of yours
really is good with kids, Annie.

02:19.958 --> 02:22.000
-You can't escape me, Toby!
-(kids screaming, laughing)

02:22.083 --> 02:23.458
(growling playfully)

02:26.000 --> 02:27.541
-Hey.
-Hey.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.416
Hey, uh, Anne, have you seen
your nephew Toby anywhere?

02:30.500 --> 02:31.708
I can't find this kid.

02:31.791 --> 02:34.291
-Uh…
-(laughs): I'm up here, Uncle Peter.

02:34.375 --> 02:36.583
I mean, I want to give him
his birthday present and all, but I think

02:36.666 --> 02:38.041
-maybe he split the party or…?
-(laughs): Up here.

02:38.125 --> 02:40.000
I mean, I just can't find him.
Do you have any idea where he is…

02:40.083 --> 02:41.666
He's on your shoulders, Peter.

02:42.750 --> 02:43.916
Oh, yeah?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.333
Oh, hey. Hi. (chuckles)

02:45.416 --> 02:46.583
There he is.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.125
All right, bud, go, go mingle.

02:48.208 --> 02:49.625
It's your… your big day.

02:49.708 --> 02:51.333
Is everything okay? You seem upset.

02:51.416 --> 02:53.541
Me? (scoffs)

02:53.625 --> 02:56.875
Ha. Yeah. No, everything's fine.

02:56.958 --> 02:58.125
Everything's fine.

02:58.208 --> 02:59.750
Okay, well, y-you're clearly not fine.

02:59.833 --> 03:01.083
I mean, look, you just started

03:01.166 --> 03:02.958
-full-on crying out of nowhere.
-(sniffles)

03:03.041 --> 03:04.625
Let's just not talk about it right here,
Peter, okay?

03:04.708 --> 03:05.958
-Okay.
-Okay. Good.

03:06.041 --> 03:07.541
I feel like, whatever it is,
you can just tell me.

03:07.625 --> 03:09.416
Uh, it's gonna be weird
to go back to the party.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.458
-You're crying.
-I want to break up with you.

03:15.416 --> 03:16.416
What?!

03:16.500 --> 03:18.416
Don't we have a really good time together?

03:18.500 --> 03:19.958
We do. It's just not enough.

03:20.041 --> 03:24.083
I… I'm ready for the next chapter
in my life, and…

03:24.166 --> 03:26.666
you're still figuring a lot out.

03:26.750 --> 03:28.750
Like what?

03:29.833 --> 03:32.416
Your roommates are college students.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.416
Okay. But they're very mature people.

03:35.500 --> 03:36.916
And they're prelaw.
They're practically lawyers.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.958
You also don't even know
what you want to do with your life.

03:40.041 --> 03:45.083
I… I think I'm just kind of,
like, doing it. (chuckles)

03:45.166 --> 03:47.291
29 is the new 16.

03:47.375 --> 03:48.416
You're 32.

03:48.500 --> 03:51.791
Yeah, I mean, if you want to be,
like, a scientist about it, I'm 32.

03:51.875 --> 03:54.333
Look, I met someone.

03:55.416 --> 03:56.541
(sighs)

03:58.375 --> 04:01.708
Why didn't you just say that
instead of making me eat your steak?

04:01.791 --> 04:04.416
I mean, this just makes no sense.
It's completely out of nowhere.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.916
Oh, no, it's not.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.708
I have been unhappy for a while, Peter.

04:08.791 --> 04:10.416
Really? You have? I mean…

04:10.500 --> 04:11.875
-Yes. Yes.
-You never said anything.

04:11.958 --> 04:13.208
We're stuck.

04:13.291 --> 04:14.625
No, what-what do we do?

04:14.708 --> 04:18.000
We go to work and we make salmon
and we watch Dancing with the Stars.

04:18.083 --> 04:20.000
Oh, come on. I…

04:20.083 --> 04:22.625
We do stuff. We went to Wind Creek Casino
to see Rod Stewart.

04:23.708 --> 04:24.916
Okay.

04:26.125 --> 04:29.041
I was never supposed to be
an English teacher, Peter.

04:30.041 --> 04:34.000
My sense memory professor said
I could've been the next Kate Winslet.

04:34.083 --> 04:36.041
-You still could be.
-Not with you.

04:36.125 --> 04:38.291
-(sighs) God.
-Oh, Peter, that's not-- I didn't…

04:38.375 --> 04:41.791
I mean, that is a really specific
and hurtful thing to say.

04:41.875 --> 04:44.458
-Not with me?
-I'm sorry, but it's true.

04:44.541 --> 04:46.541
Okay.

04:46.625 --> 04:48.750
You're very…

04:48.833 --> 04:51.416
complacent, and it makes me complacent.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.833
And I really wanted a big life.

04:53.916 --> 04:56.041
Yeah, I wanted to study
commedia dell'arte in Florence,

04:56.125 --> 04:59.833
and I wanted to do Shakespeare
at the Globe in London.

04:59.916 --> 05:01.250
(Peter sighs)

05:02.833 --> 05:05.458
Six years and we've never even been
out of the country together.

05:07.416 --> 05:10.291
-But we did go see…
-Don't say Rod Stewart.

05:10.375 --> 05:15.291
So, this new girl, is she, like,
really together or something?

05:15.375 --> 05:17.541
I-I guess so.

05:17.625 --> 05:20.541
I mean, she has this little pie shop
down the street from my gym and…

05:20.625 --> 05:21.916
Cute.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.541
I don't know why that matters.
(clears throat)

05:27.583 --> 05:29.208
What?

05:29.291 --> 05:30.416
I'm sorry, Peter.

05:30.500 --> 05:32.916
You are the last person in the world
I want to hurt.

05:36.041 --> 05:37.541
I should…

05:38.958 --> 05:41.416
I should probably get back downstairs.

05:41.500 --> 05:44.666
Well, do you mind if I stick around long
enough to sing "Happy Birthday" to Toby?

05:44.750 --> 05:46.208
Peter, I don't think that's a good idea.

05:46.291 --> 05:47.875
I promise I can keep it together.

05:47.958 --> 05:52.208
-(sobbing)

05:55.750 --> 05:57.291
(sobbing):

05:57.375 --> 05:59.000
It's probably just at a red light.

06:01.250 --> 06:02.583
Uh…

06:04.375 --> 06:05.666
Oh, man, and…

06:05.750 --> 06:07.333
Okay, so he just canceled.

06:07.416 --> 06:08.875
-It's… okay.
-Oh.

06:08.958 --> 06:10.958
-I-I'll wait around for the next one.
-No, please don't.

06:11.041 --> 06:13.000
It's fine. You can just leave.

06:15.583 --> 06:17.333
Uh…

06:17.416 --> 06:21.041
I just-- I don't want you
to break up with me.

06:21.125 --> 06:22.750
I love you.

06:25.791 --> 06:28.250
I'm sorry, Emma.

06:28.333 --> 06:29.583
(sighs)

06:36.041 --> 06:38.041
(sobbing softly)

06:41.291 --> 06:42.416
(sighs)

06:42.500 --> 06:46.208
(sobbing loudly):
Oh, my God!

06:46.291 --> 06:49.291
("The Glory of Love"
by Jimmy Durante playing)

06:50.500 --> 06:52.125
Oh, my God!

06:52.208 --> 06:54.208
(sobbing loudly)

07:08.500 --> 07:12.125
PETER and

07:12.208 --> 07:14.541
-(students cheering, clapping)

07:30.291 --> 07:31.833
(both laughing)

07:31.916 --> 07:33.416
-(straining)
-(grunts)

07:33.500 --> 07:34.916
(laughing)

07:36.333 --> 07:38.208
You want one? Smoothie?

07:49.041 --> 07:50.875
(sighs)

07:50.958 --> 07:53.333
-(grunts)

07:53.416 --> 07:56.166
-(scoffs)

07:57.166 --> 07:58.583
(strained):
I can do it.

07:58.666 --> 07:59.666
(laughs) See?

07:59.750 --> 08:01.166
This is why you call movers.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.250
(grunts) Look at that.

08:03.333 --> 08:05.291
-(Peter mutters)
-Come take a look.

08:05.375 --> 08:07.208
-(sighs) Hey!
-Huh? Look at this.

08:13.833 --> 08:16.416
-(sighs)

08:16.500 --> 08:18.500
(crowd cheering, shouting)

08:20.666 --> 08:22.458
(whooping, laughing)

08:22.541 --> 08:23.625
(yelling)

08:24.666 --> 08:26.083
Oh, my…

08:26.166 --> 08:27.500
Aw.

08:27.583 --> 08:29.291
What do you know about that?!

08:29.375 --> 08:30.583
-I got the ball!
-Right?!

08:30.666 --> 08:32.166
(sighs)

08:36.500 --> 08:37.833
(clicks tongue)

08:37.916 --> 08:39.250
(sighs)

08:39.333 --> 08:40.875
(sobs)

08:43.625 --> 08:45.375
-Emma?
-(panting) Yeah?

08:45.458 --> 08:47.333
We're watching TV.

08:47.416 --> 08:49.125
Two more minutes.

08:50.125 --> 08:51.916
-Damn it!
-(turning up TV volume)

09:05.625 --> 09:10.000
-(muffled sobbing)

09:17.125 --> 09:19.083
-(muffled whimpering)
-(song ends)

09:25.750 --> 09:27.000
(door closes)

09:34.791 --> 09:36.208
Oh, God.

09:37.666 --> 09:39.125
(door opens, closes)

09:39.208 --> 09:41.541
Good morning, Dr. McMillan.

09:41.625 --> 09:42.666
(door closes)

09:45.000 --> 09:46.416
Morning, Chloe.

09:48.833 --> 09:50.583
(sputtering sigh)

09:52.375 --> 09:54.958
Happy Monday, folks.

09:55.041 --> 09:57.500
(sighs) Okay.

09:57.583 --> 10:01.208
Let's talk about increasing profit margins

10:01.291 --> 10:03.750
for our residential dining program.

10:03.833 --> 10:05.541
These people are on death's door,

10:05.625 --> 10:07.541
and we are spending
way too much money feeding them.

10:07.625 --> 10:09.375
Who has pitches?

10:09.458 --> 10:11.083
We could stop offering ice.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.583
How would their drinks be cold?

10:13.666 --> 10:15.041
They wouldn't.

10:15.125 --> 10:16.541
Okay. I like it.

10:16.625 --> 10:18.000
I think we need something bigger.

10:18.083 --> 10:19.833
Who else has something?

10:19.916 --> 10:21.333
We could replace our real chicken

10:21.416 --> 10:23.708
with a much cheaper new product
called Hint of Chicken.

10:23.791 --> 10:25.916
(chuckles) What the hell
is Hint of Chicken?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.833
The name's
pretty self-explanatory, ma'am.

10:27.916 --> 10:30.333
Can you liquefy it
and sip it through a straw?

10:30.416 --> 10:32.708
-Yes, ma'am.
-You can gum it?

10:32.791 --> 10:34.291
No teeth required.

10:34.375 --> 10:36.375
-Is it a protein?
-It's protein adjacent.

10:36.458 --> 10:38.041
Does it need to be refrigerated?

10:38.125 --> 10:40.458
-'Cause I think we're gonna give up ice.
-Yeah.

10:40.541 --> 10:42.333
-Shelf life is stable.
-What the fuck?!

10:43.541 --> 10:45.541
Peter, are you okay?

10:46.791 --> 10:48.500
(smacks lips) Uh, yeah.

10:48.583 --> 10:52.000
Uh… excuse me for one second. I j--

10:52.083 --> 10:55.875
I'm sorry, I j-- I just get really upset
when I-I think about how much money

10:55.958 --> 10:58.250
we're-we're spending on
feeding old people, all right?

10:58.333 --> 11:01.416
So maybe I'll just step outside
and-and get some fresh air

11:01.500 --> 11:04.375
because I just don't know
who the fuck this guy is.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.541
All right.

11:08.625 --> 11:10.041
Let me see.

11:12.125 --> 11:15.333
-I hate them. I look so ugly.
-Amy, Amy, stop.

11:15.416 --> 11:16.750
Listen, you're so beautiful.

11:16.833 --> 11:19.125
All the braces in the world
couldn't change how much I love you.

11:19.208 --> 11:20.333
(chuckles softly)

11:20.416 --> 11:21.625
I love you more.

11:21.708 --> 11:22.750
Not possible.

11:24.416 --> 11:27.750
-(crying)
-(door closes)

11:27.833 --> 11:30.416
(sobs, breathes deeply)

11:30.500 --> 11:34.000
You're an adult… in a workplace.

11:35.125 --> 11:36.291
(crying):
Get it together.

11:36.375 --> 11:37.375
(sobbing loudly)

11:37.458 --> 11:39.041
Hello?

11:41.166 --> 11:43.208
Hello?

11:43.291 --> 11:44.583
(voice breaks):
Is everything okay?

11:44.666 --> 11:46.916
Oh, I'm fine. I'm just, um…

11:48.291 --> 11:51.500
…the fire marshal of the floor.

11:51.583 --> 11:54.458
So I have to check the stairway
for obstacles,

11:54.541 --> 11:56.500
but obviously there aren't any,
so we're all clear.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.625
(voice breaks):
Be safe out there.

11:57.708 --> 11:59.541
-All right. All right, uh…
-Have a good day.

11:59.625 --> 12:00.833
So that is great.

12:00.916 --> 12:03.166
Well, hang on one second. I'm sorry.

12:03.250 --> 12:07.458
Uh, you have mascara
pretty much all over your whole face.

12:07.541 --> 12:09.333
Is that so? (sniffles)

12:09.416 --> 12:10.916
Oh, indeed. (laughs)

12:11.000 --> 12:12.500
(voice breaks):
Thank you so much.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.125
(sniffles)

12:14.208 --> 12:17.666
(sighs) Waterproof, my ass.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.166
Oh.

12:19.250 --> 12:23.083
You actually have, like,
a piece of toilet paper or something.

12:23.166 --> 12:25.625
-Oh. Do I really?
-Other side.

12:25.708 --> 12:27.333
-There. Yes.
-Oh.

12:27.416 --> 12:28.458
-(chuckles)
-Got it.

12:28.541 --> 12:30.041
-(laughs)
-Mm-hmm.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.291
Having a rough week.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.291
Me, too.

12:33.375 --> 12:35.041
Just got dumped.

12:35.125 --> 12:37.291
Oh, me, too.

12:37.375 --> 12:38.708
Oh, yeah?

12:38.791 --> 12:40.041
That's weird.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.500
It's terrible.

12:43.500 --> 12:45.250
Do you want to talk about it?

12:45.333 --> 12:46.750
Um…

12:48.541 --> 12:49.833
Okay.

12:49.916 --> 12:51.583
-Okay. (sniffles)
-That's, um,

12:51.666 --> 12:53.291
that's interesting. (sniffles)

12:54.375 --> 12:56.833
S-Step into my office.

12:56.916 --> 12:59.208
-All right. (laughs)
-(chuckles)

13:00.208 --> 13:01.833
I'm Peter.

13:01.916 --> 13:05.583
I-I'm a VP at
Mariposa Retirement Homes on 11.

13:05.666 --> 13:11.000
I'm Emma, and I'm the receptionist
at McMillan Orthodontics…

13:11.083 --> 13:12.250
(breathes deeply)

13:12.333 --> 13:13.916
…on 14 here.

13:14.000 --> 13:18.083
Hey, um, I don't really smoke,
but I bought these last night.

13:18.166 --> 13:20.333
It just kind of seemed like
the thing that people do.

13:20.416 --> 13:22.291
Oh. Yeah, they do.

13:22.375 --> 13:24.750
-Yeah, you were right to buy them.
-Uh, would you like one?

13:24.833 --> 13:28.208
Well, back when I was the fire marshal,
I would've said that that's not allowed.

13:28.291 --> 13:30.708
-(chuckles softly)
-No, but yeah.

13:30.791 --> 13:32.541
Okay. Here you go.

13:33.958 --> 13:35.333
(inhales sharply) Yeah.

13:35.416 --> 13:37.791
(coughing) Oh, my God.

13:37.875 --> 13:40.125
(coughing)

13:41.208 --> 13:43.125
My boyfriend's name was Noah.

13:43.208 --> 13:47.166
Um, we were together for 18 months.

13:47.250 --> 13:49.500
That's the longest relationship
I've ever been in.

13:49.583 --> 13:51.500
-I think I'm gonna put this out.
-(stammers, coughs)

13:51.583 --> 13:53.750
I was waiting for you to--
(coughs) Thanks for the offer.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.500
(coughs) I don't see the appeal.

13:55.583 --> 13:56.625
-(coughs)
-Mm.

13:56.708 --> 14:00.416
Anne and I were together for… six years.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.541
-Holy shit.
-Yeah, I know.

14:02.625 --> 14:04.791
And I wanted to get married.

14:04.875 --> 14:07.500
-Have kids, all that.
-Mm.

14:07.583 --> 14:09.791
But, uh, you know,
she wanted to be an artist

14:09.875 --> 14:12.375
and, I guess, drink wine
with some fuck-wad in a Fonzie jacket.

14:12.458 --> 14:13.875
I really don't know what… (sighs)

14:13.958 --> 14:17.708
Noah wants a woman who owns a pie shop.

14:17.791 --> 14:19.166
I love pie.

14:20.333 --> 14:22.250
(sobbing)

14:22.333 --> 14:24.250
I'm sorry I just said that.

14:24.333 --> 14:25.541
I probably shouldn't have said that.

14:25.625 --> 14:27.666
It's cool. Everyone loves pie.

14:27.750 --> 14:28.916
Pie's actually not that great.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.333
It's very-- there's very limited options
when it comes to pie.

14:31.416 --> 14:33.375
-Okay. (chuckles)
-(sighs) This was awkward.

14:33.458 --> 14:35.041
-Very.
-Uh… (laughs)

14:35.125 --> 14:39.041
-Have a nice day and… uh…
-So get back there and make it happen.

14:41.750 --> 14:43.791
-(sighs)
-So you want to…

14:43.875 --> 14:45.875
-("Torn" instrumental playing)

14:52.666 --> 14:54.750
Dying alone is not that bad.

14:54.833 --> 14:57.250
Like, why do you want someone
to watch you die?

14:57.333 --> 14:59.208
-That's, like, actually embarrassing.
-(slurring): That's right.

14:59.291 --> 15:00.833
Dying alone's actually g-- pretty sweet

15:00.916 --> 15:02.916
'cause you're all alone
and no one's bothering you.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.000
-Bomb.
-(Emma groans)

15:04.083 --> 15:05.083
I love being single.

15:05.166 --> 15:06.375
I'm really looking forward to it.

15:06.458 --> 15:08.041
All the apps, getting on the apps.

15:08.125 --> 15:09.708
-(slurring): Yeah.
-That's gonna be cool.

15:09.791 --> 15:12.791
Swipe left, swipe right, who's ugly.

15:12.875 --> 15:18.208

15:20.041 --> 15:22.833
-I dedicate this to my freaking self!
-(electronic dance music playing)

15:23.916 --> 15:25.416
PETER and
Joy!

15:25.500 --> 15:27.708
-Oh, yeah, Joy!
-(laughing)

15:27.791 --> 15:32.333
-("You Oughta Know" instrumental playing)

15:35.958 --> 15:38.083
This is the chorus.
You want to jump in on this with me?

15:38.166 --> 15:39.833
-I want to call Noah.
-Yeah.

15:39.916 --> 15:41.208
Wh-What? No.

15:41.291 --> 15:42.625
-Yeah, because it's, like…
-No, no.

15:42.708 --> 15:44.333
-Oh, wh… hey, it fell all
the way right… -No. No.

15:44.416 --> 15:45.416
-(sighs)
-Oh.

15:45.500 --> 15:47.416
(over speakers):
Sir, I need you to return that phone.

15:47.500 --> 15:48.625
No, no, no, no, no.

15:48.708 --> 15:50.791
-I need to have it back.
-Okay, listen to me.

15:50.875 --> 15:52.958
They dumped us, right?

15:53.041 --> 15:55.541
-If they miss us, they'll call.
-(groans)

15:55.625 --> 15:57.416
But they're never
gonna miss us if we call,

15:57.500 --> 16:01.041
so we can't call
if we want them to miss us or call.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.375
-Huh?
-I don't know.

16:02.458 --> 16:04.166
I feel like Anne's just going through
something right now,

16:04.250 --> 16:07.666
but any minute, she's gonna realize
she made a terrible mistake,

16:07.750 --> 16:09.333
and then she's gonna take me back.

16:09.416 --> 16:11.000
And I bet Noah will, too.

16:11.083 --> 16:13.500
Yeah, I bet he definitely would
if I called him right now.

16:13.583 --> 16:14.625
All right, look.

16:14.708 --> 16:16.125
What about this?

16:16.208 --> 16:17.750
It's a good plan.

16:17.833 --> 16:18.875
-Hear me out.
-Mm-hmm.

16:18.958 --> 16:23.208
How about, whenever we're feeling
like we really have to call them

16:23.291 --> 16:25.500
-and we just can't take it anymore…
-Mm-hmm?

16:25.583 --> 16:28.666
…instead of calling our exes,
let's call each other.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.875
Mm! I love that.

16:30.958 --> 16:32.208
-Yeah?
-I love it

16:32.291 --> 16:33.750
because we're intercepting
each other's sadness.

16:33.833 --> 16:35.000
-Yes.
-Yes.

16:35.083 --> 16:37.375
We're each other's sadness sisters.

16:37.458 --> 16:41.291
Well, "Sadness Sisters" sounds like
you're Diane Keaton and I'm Meryl Streep

16:41.375 --> 16:43.708
and we're in a Broadway play,
but I like it, yeah.

16:43.791 --> 16:45.250
That's a great cast.

16:45.333 --> 16:46.458
You should cast plays.

16:49.666 --> 16:51.375

17:06.583 --> 17:07.666
You again?

17:07.750 --> 17:08.833
Okay, ready?

17:08.916 --> 17:11.958
What is the minimum sentence
for first-degree assault

17:12.041 --> 17:16.166
of persons blind, disabled or pregnant?

17:16.250 --> 17:17.750
-Five years?
-Excellent.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.458
-Very nice, babe. Good job.
-Mm.

17:19.541 --> 17:21.083
Good job, babe.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.541
Morning, roomies.

17:22.625 --> 17:25.041
(groans):
Oh. Oh, God.

17:25.125 --> 17:27.416
Is that a piece of Cinnamon Toast Crunch
in your hair?

17:28.500 --> 17:30.541
-No, on the other side. Yeah.
-Oh.

17:33.916 --> 17:35.000
So it is.

17:36.083 --> 17:38.541
Another correct answer.

17:40.208 --> 17:41.333
Eagle eyes.

17:41.416 --> 17:42.458
(Paul and Lisa chuckle)

17:42.541 --> 17:45.291
Proceed. (chuckles)

17:45.375 --> 17:47.541
Uh, just a quick reminder.

17:47.625 --> 17:49.916
We're having this study group
over on Saturday, you know,

17:50.000 --> 17:53.041
just in case you wanted to… not be here.

17:53.125 --> 17:54.791
Oh, young man,

17:54.875 --> 17:57.791
maybe I'll just stay here
in the apartment that I pay to live at,

17:57.875 --> 18:00.666
but who knows?

18:00.750 --> 18:02.958
-Who knows?
-(Lisa chuckles)

18:04.000 --> 18:05.583
Land this thing!

18:07.208 --> 18:08.500
Where the hell is The Virus?

18:08.583 --> 18:10.375
EMMA (quietly):
Thanks for meeting me.

18:10.458 --> 18:12.416
That's what
the Sadness Sisters are for, right?

18:12.500 --> 18:14.541
-(alarm beeping over screen)
-Oh, yeah!

18:14.625 --> 18:16.166
Want a Raisinet?

18:17.875 --> 18:19.833
(alarm beeping over screen)

18:19.916 --> 18:21.458
-(sighs)
-Don't be sad.

18:21.541 --> 18:22.708
This isn't a sad movie, okay?

18:22.791 --> 18:24.416
Nic Cage is gonna survive in the end.
We're not…

18:24.500 --> 18:26.250
Thanks a lot.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.375
(whispering):
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. Sorry about that.

18:30.083 --> 18:32.750
Movie's, like, 25 years old.
I didn't think I could spoil it.

18:32.833 --> 18:35.291
I'm not sad because of the movie.

18:35.375 --> 18:40.333
I'm sad because Noah was
my airplane safety mask person.

18:41.666 --> 18:42.750
Your what?

18:43.833 --> 18:46.375
(sighs) My airplane safety mask person.

18:46.458 --> 18:48.791
-What is that?
-(sighs)

18:48.875 --> 18:52.500
Have you ever been on an airplane
and they play that video that says,

18:52.583 --> 18:56.916
"Please secure your own oxygen mask
before helping others"?

18:57.000 --> 18:59.791
Yeah, that's every airplane I've been on.

18:59.875 --> 19:02.166
Well, I remember, when I was little,

19:02.250 --> 19:05.833
thinking that,
if I were ever really in love

19:05.916 --> 19:08.458
-and I was on an airplane with my lover…
-Hmm.

19:08.541 --> 19:12.000
…that I would put his mask on
before my own.

19:12.083 --> 19:14.791
When you were little, you used
the word "lover" in your thoughts?

19:14.875 --> 19:16.291
(both laugh quietly)

19:16.375 --> 19:19.125
Well, that's not the point.

19:19.208 --> 19:20.625
-Well, it's kind of ridiculous…
-No.

19:20.708 --> 19:22.166
…because you always put
your own mask on first.

19:22.250 --> 19:23.708
No, you don't.

19:23.791 --> 19:25.333
You're actually more helpful to others

19:25.416 --> 19:27.125
once you're getting
a steady flow of oxygen to your brain.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.125
-Oh, that's just…
-It's just logical, right?

19:29.208 --> 19:30.875
You're actually putting your "lover"

19:30.958 --> 19:32.041
-at greater risk…
-Why did you do that?

19:32.125 --> 19:34.125
-Would you two shut the fuck up?
-…by not putting on your mask. Sorry.

19:34.208 --> 19:35.791
(whispering): By not putting
your own mask on first, so…

19:35.875 --> 19:37.333
No, but it's not about that.

19:37.416 --> 19:39.875
-It's about romance.
-I don't mean for it not…

19:39.958 --> 19:42.291
-It would be immediate that I can't…
-(laughs)

19:42.375 --> 19:44.500
-It's all true.
-Yeah.

19:44.583 --> 19:47.375
-All right. (sighs)
-(sighs)

19:47.458 --> 19:49.791
You want to have lunch tomorrow?

19:49.875 --> 19:51.500
Uh, yeah.

19:51.583 --> 19:52.916
Yeah, that sounds nice. Let's do it.

19:53.000 --> 19:54.666
-Okay.
-All right. See ya.

19:54.750 --> 19:56.000
-Bye.
-Bye.

19:59.750 --> 20:00.916
This is what I need.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.250
I just need to see
what's happening with him,

20:03.333 --> 20:04.708
and then…

20:04.791 --> 20:05.958
-All right, let's just do it, right?
-Yeah.

20:06.041 --> 20:07.708
Let's just rip off the Band-Aid and look.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.416
-Let's just do it. Let's just do it.
-You got it. Okay, here we go.

20:09.500 --> 20:10.833
Oh, my God.

20:10.916 --> 20:12.875
Oh, no.

20:12.958 --> 20:15.875
-Jesus, this is, this is bad.
-Why?

20:15.958 --> 20:17.416
This pie girl is really pretty.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.041
Look at her muffins.

20:19.125 --> 20:21.416
She looks like
she's really good at her job.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.833
And look at her with my boyfriend.

20:23.916 --> 20:25.916
They look so happy.

20:26.000 --> 20:28.500
Hey, guys. I just wanted
to show you these pies I made

20:28.583 --> 20:30.875
for Chrissy Teigen
and John Legend's anniversary party.

20:30.958 --> 20:33.375
This is like a mean prank.

20:33.458 --> 20:35.083
-I can't take it with this guy.
-(drops phone on table)

20:35.166 --> 20:36.375
Look at that bio.

20:36.458 --> 20:37.833
"Logan Santos.

20:37.916 --> 20:41.041
Artist. Director. Human."

20:41.125 --> 20:42.750
Oh, you're a human man?

20:42.833 --> 20:44.791
-Wow.
-Dude, that's awesome. What's that like?

20:44.875 --> 20:46.791
I bet he's a chill hang.

20:47.791 --> 20:49.708
"Come help paint sets for
Andrews Middle School production

20:49.791 --> 20:51.250
-of Little Shop of Horrors."
-Oh.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.041
Is he 14?

20:53.125 --> 20:55.458
Andrews Middle School,
that's… that's Anne's school.

20:55.541 --> 21:00.625
So… so this guy is the drama teacher
at her school? Really?

21:00.708 --> 21:02.875
Really? This is her living a-a big life?

21:02.958 --> 21:05.750
Leaving me for
a middle school drama teacher?

21:05.833 --> 21:07.750
Ooh, she commented on
this picture of him drinking coffee.

21:07.833 --> 21:08.833
What'd she say?

21:08.916 --> 21:10.791
Ugh, you don't want to know.

21:10.875 --> 21:12.250
I think I do want to know.
What did-- what did she write?

21:12.333 --> 21:14.041
He's just drinking coffee
and it's, like…

21:14.125 --> 21:15.250
-Well…
-…that kind of content.

21:15.333 --> 21:17.208
-See, I feel like you're trying
to protect me. -I am.

21:17.291 --> 21:18.583
But that's actually--
it's making it worse.

21:18.666 --> 21:20.125
-Now I have to know what she says.
-No, you don't.

21:20.208 --> 21:21.958
-Come on. Let me-- Can I…
-It's just, like, not-- It's not.

21:22.041 --> 21:23.416
-It's not. It doesn't matter.
-May…

21:23.500 --> 21:25.625
-I don't-- It's a-- Okay.
-Come on.

21:26.708 --> 21:29.541
(sighs) She wrote kissy face,
kissy face, coffee cup.

21:29.625 --> 21:31.166
Yeah, it's, like, stupid.

21:31.250 --> 21:34.958
Oh, and he wrote,
"I miss you. Come back to bed."

21:37.541 --> 21:38.916
(smacks lips)

21:39.000 --> 21:41.166
-Wow, I…
-I'm sorry.

21:42.250 --> 21:45.291
So she's, like, fully
in a new relationship.

21:45.375 --> 21:46.375
Uh…

21:48.041 --> 21:50.291
(sighs heavily)

21:55.250 --> 21:56.333
(sighs)

21:57.750 --> 21:59.458
I can't do this.

21:59.541 --> 22:01.166
I-I can't start over, you know?

22:01.250 --> 22:03.041
I'm-I'm too old.

22:03.125 --> 22:04.708
I'm too old. I missed the boat.

22:04.791 --> 22:08.041
(stammers) All my friends,
they're married, they got kids.

22:08.125 --> 22:11.250
-My one friend Dave,
he's got a 12-year-old son. -Mm.

22:11.333 --> 22:13.916
Dave has a kid who's old enough
to have his own kid.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.791
You think 12 years old
is old enough to have a kid?

22:16.875 --> 22:18.333
I'm not saying it'd be a good idea.

22:18.416 --> 22:20.458
I'm just saying Cody's
definitely gone through puberty,

22:20.541 --> 22:22.833
-so his body's definitely producing semen.
-No.

22:22.916 --> 22:24.875
-Biologically speaking, yeah,
the semen's there. -No, no.

22:24.958 --> 22:26.166
-I need you to stop talking about…
-The babies are…

22:26.250 --> 22:27.250
Don't do that.

22:27.333 --> 22:31.500
The point is, at this rate,
I'm gonna wind up old and alone.

22:31.583 --> 22:33.708
I'm gonna have no grandkids.

22:33.791 --> 22:35.833
I'm gonna be eating Hint of Chicken

22:35.916 --> 22:38.208
in one of the hellhole nursing homes
I helped create.

22:38.291 --> 22:39.708
Oh, me, too.

22:39.791 --> 22:44.083
I'm never gonna find a man
as kind and good as Noah.

22:44.166 --> 22:45.500
Yeah.

22:45.583 --> 22:47.708
He was the love of my life.

22:48.791 --> 22:51.166
A-Anne is the love of mine.

22:53.375 --> 22:55.500
And I feel like
I'm still the love of hers.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.083
You know?

22:59.375 --> 23:01.625
We can't give up.
We have to get them back.

23:01.708 --> 23:03.541
(sighs) What?

23:03.625 --> 23:05.291
It's just like you said.

23:05.375 --> 23:08.708
-We know that we're supposed to be
with Noah and Anne. -Mm.

23:08.791 --> 23:10.875
But I'm not so sure
that they're gonna realize it,

23:10.958 --> 23:13.958
not with these shiny new people around.

23:14.041 --> 23:15.583
So what are we supposed to do?

23:15.666 --> 23:17.625
We have to…

23:17.708 --> 23:19.541
(scoffs)

23:19.625 --> 23:21.458
We have to break them up.

23:21.541 --> 23:23.458
(laughs)

23:23.541 --> 23:25.541
Well, that's crazy. We can't do that.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.458
How would we do that?

23:30.541 --> 23:33.041
What if we follow Ginny around, right?

23:33.125 --> 23:35.208
And-and we discover
all her dirty little secrets,

23:35.291 --> 23:39.166
and then we slip them to Noah in, like,
an unmarked envelope or something.

23:39.250 --> 23:40.708
What if she doesn't have any?

23:40.791 --> 23:42.000
Then we create some, right?

23:42.083 --> 23:44.750
Little Photoshop makes it look like
Ginny does fracking.

23:44.833 --> 23:47.583
Oh, I would never date someone
if they did fracking.

23:47.666 --> 23:49.750
Right? Yeah, no, me neither.

23:49.833 --> 23:52.333
-What is fracking?
-I don't know, actually.

23:55.208 --> 23:58.416
I could tell Noah
that I'm pregnant with his baby.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.208
All right. How's that help me?

24:00.291 --> 24:03.666
You tell Anne
she's pregnant with your baby.

24:03.750 --> 24:05.000
All right, what if we do this?

24:05.083 --> 24:06.166
All right, hear me out.

24:06.250 --> 24:10.541
We send Noah a note from Ginny that says,
"Meet me at my grandmother's cabin

24:10.625 --> 24:13.666
for a weekend of fishing,
maybe a little bit of fun."

24:13.750 --> 24:16.416
But when he gets there, you are there,

24:16.500 --> 24:19.291
-and you're lying naked
on a bearskin rug… -Oh.

24:19.375 --> 24:21.291
…and you say,

24:21.375 --> 24:22.750
"I knew you'd come."

24:23.833 --> 24:25.041
What?

24:25.125 --> 24:27.125
But he didn't know what he was coming to.

24:27.208 --> 24:29.083
Mm, yeah, but it doesn't matter, right?

24:29.166 --> 24:32.958
Because you seduce him very quickly before
he has a chance to get back to his car.

24:33.041 --> 24:34.958
Which I guess would be pretty quick.

24:35.041 --> 24:37.625
Okay, all right, you know, we'll file
this one under "work in progress."

24:37.708 --> 24:39.583
Well, there is something there.

24:39.666 --> 24:40.875
There is something there, right?
To the cabin.

24:40.958 --> 24:43.208
No, the cabin is nothing.

24:43.291 --> 24:45.416
I could seduce Logan.

24:45.500 --> 24:47.666
-Whoa.
-And then Anne would find out

24:47.750 --> 24:49.583
and she would get so upset of course,
and she would dump him

24:49.666 --> 24:52.166
because she would be like,
"Whoa, I miss my ex-boyfriend."

24:52.250 --> 24:54.041
-Me.
-"He was so nice and sweet,

24:54.125 --> 24:55.875
and we had six years
and he never cheated on me once."

24:55.958 --> 24:56.958
No, that's true. I never did.

24:57.041 --> 24:58.291
And don't think I didn't have
my chances, you know?

24:58.375 --> 25:00.791
-I don't.
-My dry cleaner was super into me,

25:00.875 --> 25:03.041
-um, until she died of natural causes.
-Uh…

25:03.125 --> 25:05.875
But, um, do you really think
you can seduce Logan?

25:05.958 --> 25:10.375
I mean, I don't want to brag,
but, um, in high school, (chuckles)

25:10.458 --> 25:12.625
I once kissed my married gym teacher.

25:12.708 --> 25:14.916
And his wife was really hot, so…

25:15.000 --> 25:16.583
Oh, no.

25:16.666 --> 25:18.375
And it was, like, a whole thing.

25:18.458 --> 25:19.875
Um, let's move past that.

25:19.958 --> 25:22.041
All right, and then I could, too--

25:22.125 --> 25:24.541
I could steal Ginny away from Noah.

25:24.625 --> 25:26.000
(laughs)

25:26.083 --> 25:27.791
Wh… Why are you laughing?

25:27.875 --> 25:29.708
I'm not-- I don't think I was laughing.
I…

25:29.791 --> 25:31.333
You don't, you don't think I could do it?

25:31.416 --> 25:33.333
I-- Have you seen Noah,
what he's like and everything?

25:33.416 --> 25:35.083
-Yes.
-Oh, okay.

25:35.166 --> 25:36.833
I mean, yeah,
he's a classically handsome guy,

25:36.916 --> 25:39.000
but I-I, uh, I, uh, I offer a lot.

25:39.083 --> 25:41.250
I think that you are somebody

25:41.333 --> 25:43.375
that a person could fall
very deeply in love with.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.208
Thank you?

25:45.291 --> 25:46.958
-But it's more like slowly.
-Mm-hmm.

25:47.041 --> 25:48.041
Over five or six months.

25:48.125 --> 25:49.875
Okay.

25:49.958 --> 25:51.541
Or like a year.

25:51.625 --> 25:52.916
Two years tops.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.875
Do you realize the number's going up?

25:54.958 --> 25:56.583
Okay, I don't think
that you can get to Ginny.

25:56.666 --> 25:58.041
You've made that perfectly clear.

25:58.125 --> 26:02.791
But I do think that you could
become Noah's friend.

26:02.875 --> 26:04.583
I could do that.

26:04.666 --> 26:07.375
I mean, people like to be my friend.
I'm extremely affable.

26:07.458 --> 26:10.416
You know, in college, all the girls
were like, "You're such a good friend."

26:10.500 --> 26:11.958
Aw, darn it.

26:12.041 --> 26:14.333
But-but-but the point is
people like to be my friend.

26:14.416 --> 26:15.666
-Right.
-I get in his head.

26:15.750 --> 26:16.916
You-- that's exactly right.

26:17.000 --> 26:20.250
You get in his head, and then you make him
realize that Ginny isn't that great.

26:20.333 --> 26:21.875
-She's not that great.
-Yeah.

26:21.958 --> 26:23.791
And that I am the one that got away.

26:23.875 --> 26:26.000
Hey, do you really think we can do this?

26:26.083 --> 26:28.583
-Yes, I do.
-I'm in if you're in.

26:28.666 --> 26:31.625
I will seduce Logan,
you will friendship seduce Noah,

26:31.708 --> 26:34.083
-and we will win back our people.
-All right.

26:34.166 --> 26:37.125
It's on. Mm!

26:37.208 --> 26:38.291
Look at us.

26:38.375 --> 26:42.333
This is like Cruel Intentions,
only sexier.

26:42.416 --> 26:44.708
How is it sexier?

26:44.791 --> 26:45.875
It's not.

27:05.833 --> 27:08.958
Uh, Steven, let's try the blue gel.
Think Last Tango in Paris.

27:10.458 --> 27:11.541
Thank you.

27:11.625 --> 27:13.958
Uh, Steph, Steph,
I was thinking more of a turquoise.

27:14.041 --> 27:15.541
You're-you're using robin's egg.

27:15.625 --> 27:19.083
Um, I know that you're 12,
but we got to get it together, please.

27:19.166 --> 27:23.291
Hi. Uh, am I in the right place?

27:23.375 --> 27:25.583
Oh, uh, are you here to volunteer?

27:25.666 --> 27:26.875
I am.

27:26.958 --> 27:28.416
-Hi. I'm Emma.
-Hi.

27:28.500 --> 27:29.875
-Uh, Logan. (chuckles)
-Hi.

27:29.958 --> 27:32.541
Um, which-which kid is yours?

27:32.625 --> 27:35.625
(laughing):
Oh, no. I'm much too young.

27:35.708 --> 27:36.958
And frickin' single.

27:37.041 --> 27:38.375
Oh, I see.

27:38.458 --> 27:40.833
-And, um, I saw your post on the Internet.
-Okay.

27:40.916 --> 27:45.916
And, um, strangely,
I was in Little Shop, um, in high school.

27:46.000 --> 27:47.416
-No way.
-Couple years ago.

27:47.500 --> 27:49.291
You don't say. Who did you play?

27:49.375 --> 27:51.125
Guess.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
Audrey.

27:54.083 --> 27:55.083
Yes.

27:55.166 --> 27:56.583
-I knew it.
-(chuckles)

27:56.666 --> 27:58.916
And I just thought, "You know what?
I'm gonna take a risk,

27:59.000 --> 28:01.541
and in that risk, I'm also gonna try
to give back to my community."

28:01.625 --> 28:03.583
-Mm.
-And that's kind of where I was when I--

28:03.666 --> 28:04.791
But also, that's weird.

28:04.875 --> 28:06.875
If I'm just being, like, a weirdo--
Sometimes I just, like--

28:06.958 --> 28:08.375
-I'm so impulsive and spontaneous…
-No.

28:08.458 --> 28:09.791
-…and have sort of this big energy.
-No, no, no, no. Hey, no.

28:09.875 --> 28:11.583
You're not weird at all.

28:11.666 --> 28:13.291
You know what that is? That's admirable.

28:14.375 --> 28:16.500
Thank you. That's really generous.

28:16.583 --> 28:17.958
What do you do here?

28:18.041 --> 28:19.583
Oh. I am the director.

28:19.666 --> 28:20.666
Oh. (chuckles)

28:20.750 --> 28:23.666
God, I feel so… that's… wow.

28:23.750 --> 28:25.291
It's-it's actually
my-my first year teaching.

28:25.375 --> 28:28.833
-Uh-huh. -I was doing experimental theater
before, back in New York and…

28:28.916 --> 28:29.916
Ooh, New York City?

28:30.000 --> 28:31.541
-Yeah, in the Big Apple.
-Wow.

28:31.625 --> 28:33.791
Uh, hey, hey, hey!
That paint is for spraying, not huffing.

28:33.875 --> 28:36.208
-Whuh-oh. Party time. (chuckles)
-These kids.

28:36.291 --> 28:37.458
-Sorry, I have to go deal with this.
-No.

28:37.541 --> 28:39.333
But why don't you jump onto
our papier-mâché team?

28:39.416 --> 28:40.666
Oh, that's so beautiful. (chuckles)

28:40.750 --> 28:42.750
-It's a little French. Um…
-Yeah, yeah. I heard that.

28:42.833 --> 28:44.708
-But so good to have you, Emma.
-Oh.

28:44.791 --> 28:46.291
Guys, guys, come on. We talked about this.

28:46.375 --> 28:50.000
So am I for real doing papier-mâché?

28:51.500 --> 28:54.166
(upbeat pop music playing over speakers)

28:58.250 --> 29:00.458
Hey, man. Peter?

29:00.541 --> 29:01.750
-Yeah.
-Hey, Noah.

29:01.833 --> 29:02.875
Hi. Hi. Nice to meet you.

29:02.958 --> 29:04.250
Hell. Ooh.

29:04.333 --> 29:06.750
Wow, that's a firm handshake
you got there. (chuckles)

29:06.833 --> 29:08.750
-We'll get you firm.
-Uh-oh.

29:08.833 --> 29:10.125
-You ready?
-Uh, sure.

29:10.208 --> 29:11.875
-Good. Let's go to my office.
-Oh, okay.

29:11.958 --> 29:13.791
We're gonna strip you down,
get some befores.

29:13.875 --> 29:15.208
Uh, okay. Uh, that's--

29:15.291 --> 29:16.458
Wait. We're gonna what? (chuckles)

29:16.541 --> 29:18.000
All right, you ready?

29:18.083 --> 29:19.375
-Uh…
-Pop that shirt off.

29:19.458 --> 29:21.000
I'd rather not. I…

29:21.083 --> 29:22.958
-Come on. Pop it off.
-No, no. I just--

29:23.041 --> 29:25.333
Maybe I'll just describe
what's happening to you and-and…

29:25.416 --> 29:27.500
I'll tell you what.
I'll take mine off, too.

29:27.583 --> 29:28.708
That's not gonna help me at all.

29:28.791 --> 29:31.333
-(laughs) You're funny.
-Yeah.

29:31.416 --> 29:33.333
Let's talk about anything
other than my body right now.

29:33.416 --> 29:35.791
Uh, who's this?
You know, who-who you got here?

29:35.875 --> 29:37.666
-Oh, that's my girl Ginny. Yeah.
-Oh, yeah?

29:37.750 --> 29:39.083
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

29:39.166 --> 29:40.666
-Girl pal or girl…?
-No, no, girlfriend.

29:40.750 --> 29:41.916
Girlfriend? Oh, yeah.

29:42.000 --> 29:43.708
And her little baby Pomegranate.

29:43.791 --> 29:45.458
All right, last chance
before we hit the floor.

29:45.541 --> 29:46.875
-Uh, yeah, I'm not taking my shirt off.
No. (chuckles) -Come on.

29:46.958 --> 29:48.875
-All right, we'll get some anyways. One…
-Ah, I feel trapped!

29:48.958 --> 29:50.875
-…two. There we go.
-I don't like this!

29:50.958 --> 29:53.458
(dance music playing over speakers)

29:53.541 --> 29:54.958
Keep your knees above your feet.

29:55.041 --> 29:56.875
(grunts) All right.
Well, where else would they be?

29:56.958 --> 29:58.291
(both chuckle)

29:58.375 --> 29:59.916
So, uh, so you and-and this Ginny,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.583
uh, uh, you guys been together
a long time or what's your deal?

30:02.666 --> 30:03.833
No, no.

30:03.916 --> 30:06.250
Well, I was in something serious,
and-- I don't know--

30:06.333 --> 30:08.541
-now this is sort of a surprise, but…
Come on. -Oh.

30:08.625 --> 30:09.916
-Oh, okay.
-Keep pushing.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.916
-So, so really this is just
like a meaningless… -Come on.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.208
…rebound kind of a, kind of a thang.

30:14.291 --> 30:16.750
No, m-more, more like-- I don't know.

30:16.833 --> 30:20.750
We-We've known each other for a while,
and, you know, well, just kind of clicked.

30:20.833 --> 30:22.250
-Oh.
-Come on. What was that?

30:22.333 --> 30:24.125
-Uh, okay.
-Really?

30:24.208 --> 30:27.333
But, yeah, she's the kind of girl
I could see going the distance with.

30:27.416 --> 30:28.458
What about your ex?

30:28.541 --> 30:31.875
I mean, did you ever imagine,
you know, going the distance with her?

30:31.958 --> 30:33.500
Not exactly.

30:33.583 --> 30:35.458
No, she-- you know, she's great.

30:35.541 --> 30:36.583
Really funny.

30:36.666 --> 30:38.791
Was she funny? See, that's--

30:38.875 --> 30:40.625
It's-it's important to remember
those things, you know?

30:40.708 --> 30:42.875
(sighs) She just couldn't
get her act together.

30:42.958 --> 30:44.375
-Ah, could she not?
-So it's a bummer.

30:44.458 --> 30:45.500
-(grunts)
-Come on.

30:45.583 --> 30:46.666
Yeah, push.

30:46.750 --> 30:48.125
Push from your core, from within.

30:48.208 --> 30:49.958
-That's gravity taking over now.
-Okay.

30:50.041 --> 30:51.916
-That's-- I'm going straight down.
(grunts) -Yeah.

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
-Single.
-(piano playing gentle music)

30:55.541 --> 30:58.250
Switch up the rhythm. Solo, single.

31:03.625 --> 31:05.708
Oh, my goodness, what are you looking at?

31:05.791 --> 31:07.208
Whose mom are you?

31:07.291 --> 31:09.250
-Nobody's.
-Then why are you here?

31:09.333 --> 31:10.833
You some kind of pervert?

31:10.916 --> 31:12.208
No, I'm not.

31:12.291 --> 31:14.333
I'm here because
I love musical theater, okay?

31:14.416 --> 31:16.041
Why are you here, narc?

31:16.125 --> 31:17.583
Work detention.

31:17.666 --> 31:20.541
Ooh. What did you do?

31:20.625 --> 31:22.291
I put the class gerbil in a blender.

31:22.375 --> 31:24.541
-Oh, my God!
-Not really.

31:24.625 --> 31:26.791
-(groans)
-Skipped science for a week.

31:27.833 --> 31:29.666
And they're making you
do this plant thing?

31:29.750 --> 31:32.875
Ooh, the education system
in this country is a hot mess.

31:32.958 --> 31:36.375
Woo-hoo! All my Skid Rowers.

31:36.458 --> 31:38.708
-Come get hats and scarves.
-Nice.

31:39.791 --> 31:41.333
-(fingers snapping)
-There's plenty for everyone.

31:41.416 --> 31:43.000
-(whispering): Hey.
-All right, slow down. Slow down.

31:43.083 --> 31:45.000
What's the deal with her?

31:45.083 --> 31:47.000
That's Miss Rivera.

31:47.083 --> 31:48.791
She teaches English.

31:48.875 --> 31:51.875
She does the costumes for the play
'cause she's banging Mr. Santos.

31:51.958 --> 31:53.875
Oh, how do you know that?

31:53.958 --> 31:55.750
Uh, Trevor, don't skimp
on the glue, please.

31:55.833 --> 31:57.041
Thank you.

31:57.125 --> 31:58.833
Yeah, Trevor, don't skimp on the glue.

31:58.916 --> 32:00.791
I got to take five.

32:04.083 --> 32:05.916
(clears throat)

32:06.000 --> 32:08.250
-Hey, Logan.
-Yes?

32:08.333 --> 32:12.166
Am I doing this right?
Because I just feel like it's so wet.

32:12.250 --> 32:13.458
I-I think if you just
take your two fingers…

32:13.541 --> 32:15.291
-Like-- yeah. Okay.
-Yes, just like that.

32:15.375 --> 32:17.541
-Yeah, you can-- okay.
-And then we'll just let it drip out.

32:17.625 --> 32:18.958
-Oh, thank you.
-Let it drip, yeah.

32:19.041 --> 32:21.291
-Just-just-- yeah.
-I don't think we've met. Hi.

32:21.375 --> 32:23.708
-Oh. (laughs)
-Oh. (laughs)

32:23.791 --> 32:25.416
Emma, this is Anne.

32:25.500 --> 32:28.541
She's one of our English teachers here
and our costume mistress

32:28.625 --> 32:30.333
and the mistress of my heart.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.458
-Uh… (chuckles)
-(laughs)

32:32.541 --> 32:33.541
This is Emma.

32:33.625 --> 32:36.041
She came to help even though
she doesn't have a kid here.

32:36.125 --> 32:37.208
Isn't that cool?

32:37.291 --> 32:38.666
-It's definitely something. (chuckles)
-Right?

32:38.750 --> 32:42.083
But, I mean, who wouldn't want
to help at a school musical?

32:42.166 --> 32:43.208
So fun.

32:43.291 --> 32:44.958
Fun?

32:45.041 --> 32:47.083
(chuckles) It's more than just fun.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.583
-Well, I was…
-You know, it's actually

32:48.666 --> 32:50.333
really impactful, I would say.

32:50.416 --> 32:52.000
It's serious.

32:52.083 --> 32:54.583
You are exposing these young minds
to the power of theater.

32:54.666 --> 32:56.458
Yeah, that's what I meant.

32:56.541 --> 32:58.166
You know how serious
I take this production.

32:58.250 --> 33:00.208
Yes, sorry. You're right, you're right.

33:00.291 --> 33:02.000
I'm-I'm a, I'm a little tense.

33:02.083 --> 33:04.250
Maybe I should've just done
The Music Man like everyone said.

33:04.333 --> 33:05.375
Stop it.

33:05.458 --> 33:08.083
I love that you're pushing the envelope.

33:09.125 --> 33:12.083
Maybe we can open a bottle of Barolo
and talk about it tonight.

33:12.166 --> 33:13.375
-(whispers): I'd love that.
-(whispers): Okay.

33:13.458 --> 33:15.125
(Logan exhales)

33:15.208 --> 33:18.625
They seemed really into each other
but kind of in that way that's like,

33:18.708 --> 33:20.666
"These people also
might murder each other."

33:20.750 --> 33:22.500
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.500
So I volunteered for
a bunch more rehearsals.

33:24.583 --> 33:27.666
I really think I can break them up
in, like, no time.

33:27.750 --> 33:28.750
Ah, nice.

33:28.833 --> 33:30.500
So what's he like?

33:30.583 --> 33:32.625
-Logan… Logan's a lot.
-Really?

33:32.708 --> 33:37.083
It's like, um, "You're actually directing
a middle school play, sir…" (chuckles)

33:37.166 --> 33:39.666
-Yeah. (groans)
-"…not a production of, like…"

33:42.458 --> 33:43.833
Can't think of a fancy play?

33:43.916 --> 33:45.500
Is the movie Titanic based on a play?

33:45.583 --> 33:48.666
-Mm, it's based on a ship.
-Yeah, I don't, uh…

33:48.750 --> 33:49.875
Tell me about Noah.

33:49.958 --> 33:51.750
Right. Um…

33:51.833 --> 33:53.250
Well, I see why you like him.

33:53.333 --> 33:55.208
I mean, the guy looks like a superhero.

33:55.291 --> 33:56.791
Uh, he's charming, he's, um…

33:56.875 --> 33:58.375
-I know all of this about him.
-(chuckles)

33:58.458 --> 33:59.583
That's why I'm trying to, like…

33:59.666 --> 34:01.666
-These are all things you know, huh? Um…
-Yeah, I just want to know, like,

34:01.750 --> 34:03.958
did he say that he missed me
or something like that?

34:04.041 --> 34:05.166
You know what he said?

34:05.250 --> 34:08.375
He said that no one has ever
made him laugh like you did.

34:08.458 --> 34:10.541
-Ugh.
-No, in a very positive way.

34:10.625 --> 34:11.625
-Like…
-Funny girl.

34:11.708 --> 34:13.750
-I would focus on the good.
-(moans) Oh, my God!

34:13.833 --> 34:15.791
(Paul and Lisa moaning)

34:15.875 --> 34:17.166
-Oh, my God, that feels so good!
-(Paul grunting)

34:17.250 --> 34:18.791
-Okay, don't be alarmed…
-I'm not.

34:18.875 --> 34:21.625
…but I believe there are people
having sex in your apartment.

34:21.708 --> 34:23.333
-Yeah, I share that belief.
-What is that?

34:23.416 --> 34:25.583
-(laughs): It's my roommates.
-What are you talking about?

34:25.666 --> 34:27.250
-You live with a couple?
-Yes, I do.

34:27.333 --> 34:30.875
I live with a couple of
broke college students who are in love,

34:30.958 --> 34:32.750
and I can't pay for
this whole place myself, so…

34:32.833 --> 34:34.750
You ever think about
getting a smaller place, you know?

34:34.833 --> 34:36.916
-Something just for you?
-Yeah, sometimes.

34:37.000 --> 34:39.375
-(Lisa moaning)
-It's like we're the only people

34:39.458 --> 34:40.458
-in the world right now.
-Oh, you are.

34:40.541 --> 34:42.416
I did not mean to live here so long.

34:42.500 --> 34:44.291
I moved in my sophomore year of college.

34:44.375 --> 34:47.041
-I was gonna move out on graduation.
-Okay.

34:47.125 --> 34:50.083
-And then my dad got sick again, and…
-Oh.

34:50.166 --> 34:52.083
So I took the semester off
to kind of, like…

34:52.166 --> 34:54.000
I'm sorry, I-I didn't know
your dad is sick.

34:54.083 --> 34:56.833
Uh, he was sick.
He had cancer for most of my life.

34:56.916 --> 34:58.291
PAUL (moans):
Oh, that feels so good.

34:58.375 --> 34:59.416
And then he died.

34:59.500 --> 35:02.041
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God!

35:02.125 --> 35:03.541
-Here it comes! Here comes my love!
-(Lisa moans)

35:03.625 --> 35:05.708
-Where do you want my love?!
-Oh, my God, everywhere!

35:05.791 --> 35:07.708
(Paul moaning loudly)

35:07.791 --> 35:10.750
-PAUL (sobbing): My God!
-(Lisa moaning)

35:10.833 --> 35:12.500
That sounded like the finale.

35:12.583 --> 35:14.375
-Yeah.
-And so what happened then?

35:14.458 --> 35:16.166
Y-You never wanted to go back
and finish school?

35:16.250 --> 35:17.333
Yeah, I did.

35:17.416 --> 35:21.166
I just thought I would figure out
what I wanted to do with my life,

35:21.250 --> 35:24.500
(chuckles):
and then I guess I never did.

35:24.583 --> 35:25.583
(door opens)

35:25.666 --> 35:27.000
-(Lisa laughing)
-Oh.

35:27.083 --> 35:29.166
-Oh, whoa. I didn't know
you guys were home. -Oh.

35:29.250 --> 35:30.500
Didn't know we had an audience.

35:30.583 --> 35:32.375
I didn't hear a thing.
Did you hear anything?

35:32.458 --> 35:34.083
-For-- when?
-I didn't hear a thing, guys,

35:34.166 --> 35:35.375
so you're-you're good.

35:35.458 --> 35:36.541
Just out here chomping chips.

35:36.625 --> 35:37.708
Gonna go get water.

35:37.791 --> 35:39.041
-- Mm.
-- Mm.

35:39.125 --> 35:41.041
So that's the crew.

35:41.125 --> 35:43.500
-Yeah, it's time to move.
-(laughing)

35:43.583 --> 35:45.000
-(grunts)
-Push.

35:45.083 --> 35:47.250
("I Want You Back"
by David Ruffin playing)

35:47.333 --> 35:48.375
Whoa!

36:01.291 --> 36:02.916
-Ow!

36:03.000 --> 36:04.916
-(Peter chatting, Noah laughing)

36:08.000 --> 36:09.666
…five, six…

36:09.750 --> 36:11.916
…seven, six…

36:21.416 --> 36:22.416
-Oh.
-Oh.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.583
-My God. Sorry.
-Oh, my gosh. No. Oh, yeah, I got it.

36:24.666 --> 36:25.875
Oh.

36:25.958 --> 36:28.125
Oh, wow. Great book.

36:28.208 --> 36:30.041
Yeah. It's one of my faves.

36:32.166 --> 36:34.541
-(Peter grunts)

36:35.708 --> 36:36.750
Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

36:36.833 --> 36:38.041
Don't get crazy on me, buddy.

36:38.125 --> 36:40.000
…two, one. Done.

36:40.083 --> 36:41.083
Yes!

36:41.166 --> 36:43.541
(singers scatting)

36:47.250 --> 36:48.875
-(Emma chatting)

36:48.958 --> 36:50.333
(phone chimes)

36:50.416 --> 36:51.458
Oh, you got a…

36:51.541 --> 36:53.125
-(gasps)
-Oh!

36:53.208 --> 36:54.375
Oh, shit, he followed you!

36:57.208 --> 36:58.875
-(whoops)

36:58.958 --> 37:02.416
-(shouts, grunts excitedly)
-All right!

37:02.500 --> 37:03.708
-(laughing)
-Yeah.

37:03.791 --> 37:06.625
-Yeah, good. Doing great.
-(panting)

37:06.708 --> 37:08.833
-All right.
-Come on, keep pushing.

37:08.916 --> 37:10.333
-(whoops)
-(song fades)

37:10.416 --> 37:12.666
(panting)

37:12.750 --> 37:14.500
-Uh-oh. He did it!
-(whoops) Yeah, boy.

37:14.583 --> 37:16.541
-Seven minutes! Yes!
-(laughing)

37:16.625 --> 37:19.208
-(laughing): Oh, hey, buddy.
-Oh, thank you, man!

37:19.291 --> 37:21.333
I never could've done that without you.
Thank you so much.

37:21.416 --> 37:23.125
-I just believed in you, buddy.
-(sighs) Yeah.

37:23.208 --> 37:24.375
(whoops)

37:24.458 --> 37:26.750
How far away is
your girlfriend's pie shop?

37:26.833 --> 37:29.625
'Cause I'd love to try one of those
healthy quiches you were telling me about.

37:29.708 --> 37:31.000
-That's a good idea.
-Yeah?

37:31.083 --> 37:33.875
-We got to fuel this body up.
-Hey, yeah, let's fuel up.

37:33.958 --> 37:35.375
It's only three or four more miles.

37:35.458 --> 37:37.458
-Come on, let's go.
-Yeah. (panting)

37:37.541 --> 37:38.583
On foot?

37:45.375 --> 37:46.916
That can't be right.

37:48.791 --> 37:51.000
Hey, man.

37:51.083 --> 37:52.583
You okay?

37:52.666 --> 37:53.875
Yeah.

37:53.958 --> 37:57.916
My dad was supposed to pick me up,
but he probably forgot.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.166
Oh.

38:00.625 --> 38:01.833
Bummer.

38:03.083 --> 38:06.375
Uh… I can give you a ride home.

38:08.041 --> 38:09.041
Okay.

38:09.125 --> 38:11.500
But just to be clear, I'm a safe person.

38:11.583 --> 38:13.791
Normally, you shouldn't get in a car
with any, like, random adult,

38:13.875 --> 38:15.166
especially if they tell you
that they're safe.

38:15.250 --> 38:17.625
That's usually a sign
that they're not safe at all.

38:17.708 --> 38:21.125
I mean, the first time
I went to a boy-girl sleepover,

38:21.208 --> 38:22.958
it was at my friend Sarah's house.

38:23.041 --> 38:25.666
And this boy Jonathan
brought all these videos,

38:25.750 --> 38:29.541
and they played the scariest movie,
and then I had to call my mom

38:29.625 --> 38:32.333
and tell her she forgot
to take me to the orthodontist,

38:32.416 --> 38:33.708
but it was like30 p.m. at night.

38:33.791 --> 38:34.833
What are you doing?

38:34.916 --> 38:36.541
Want a cig?

38:36.625 --> 38:38.500
No, I don't want a cig.

38:38.583 --> 38:40.666
And why do you even have cigs?

38:40.750 --> 38:42.416
Aren't you like nine years old?

38:42.500 --> 38:44.375
No, I'm in seventh grade.

38:44.458 --> 38:45.833
I'm 12.

38:45.916 --> 38:46.916
Are you stupid?

38:47.000 --> 38:48.708
Okay.

38:48.791 --> 38:50.916
You know what?

38:52.166 --> 38:54.250
I get that being a kid is hard.

38:54.333 --> 38:55.458
I really do get that.

38:55.541 --> 38:56.833
You're greasy, you're horny…

38:56.916 --> 38:58.666
I'm not greasy. You're greasy.

38:58.750 --> 39:00.000
Ah-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.

39:00.083 --> 39:02.708
Let me just tell you,
I don't know you well,

39:02.791 --> 39:05.500
but I feel like your whole
"I'm over the world" attitude

39:05.583 --> 39:08.625
is maybe a little bit more than
just normal tween angst.

39:10.791 --> 39:12.166
What's up?

39:13.250 --> 39:15.208
My dad is having an affair.

39:15.291 --> 39:16.583
Oh.

39:16.666 --> 39:20.583
With a research librarian named Bruce.

39:20.666 --> 39:22.833
Okay, so let me guess.

39:22.916 --> 39:26.541
The dumbass kids in your class are
making fun of you for having a gay dad.

39:26.625 --> 39:28.916
-No, my dad's always been gay.
-Oh, yeah.

39:29.000 --> 39:30.833
-He cheated on my other dad.
-Of course.

39:30.916 --> 39:33.291
He keeps trying to have
these deep talks with me about it,

39:33.375 --> 39:35.916
but I'm just like, "Fuck you, Dad.

39:36.000 --> 39:38.458
-Why don't you go do blowjobs on Bruce."
-Oh.

39:38.541 --> 39:41.125
Okay, well, first of all,
you don't do blowjobs.

39:41.208 --> 39:43.333
(stammers) No.

39:43.416 --> 39:46.250
(sighs) Being in love
is-is very complicated,

39:46.333 --> 39:49.875
and if your dad really does
love this man Bruce, then…

39:49.958 --> 39:51.250
You wouldn't get it.

39:51.333 --> 39:53.541
Your dad probably loves
having sex with your mom.

39:53.625 --> 39:56.416
Mm… well, my dad's dead,

39:56.500 --> 39:58.791
so he doesn't really have much sex
with anyone these days.

39:58.875 --> 40:00.875
Except for angels maybe.

40:00.958 --> 40:02.625
If he's lucky.

40:02.708 --> 40:05.416
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

40:06.916 --> 40:10.416
Can I tell you a little secret
about being an adult?

40:11.666 --> 40:14.250
We're all just pretending
that we know what we're doing,

40:14.333 --> 40:17.083
and we're hoping that
we don't screw it up too badly,

40:17.166 --> 40:20.791
and then we're feeling really shitty
about ourselves when we do.

40:22.958 --> 40:24.875
So… (sighs)

40:27.375 --> 40:30.375
…why don't you cut
your gay dad some slack

40:30.458 --> 40:34.041
and, um, maybe try talking to him.

40:37.041 --> 40:39.291
-That's my street.
-Okay.

40:39.375 --> 40:42.875
But could you keep driving
a little longer?

40:43.958 --> 40:45.166
Mm-hmm.

40:47.166 --> 40:49.708
(quiet chatter)

40:49.791 --> 40:51.666
Yes!

40:51.750 --> 40:53.375
Good work, buddy.

40:53.458 --> 40:55.333
-PETER (panting): Oh, my God.
-(laughing)

40:55.416 --> 40:57.625
-(Peter groans)
-Whew.

40:57.708 --> 41:00.625
That was way… way further than you said.

41:00.708 --> 41:03.416
…tart, and I threw in
a chocolate cream mini pie

41:03.500 --> 41:05.125
-just for you.
-Hey.

41:05.208 --> 41:07.250
-Hi, babe.
-Ooh.

41:07.333 --> 41:08.958
-You look nice.
-Thank you.

41:09.041 --> 41:10.958
Uh, this is Peter, my new client.

41:11.041 --> 41:12.875
And also my new buddy.

41:12.958 --> 41:14.708
Oh, nice. Hi. I'm Ginny.

41:14.791 --> 41:15.791
Oh, hey.

41:15.875 --> 41:17.125
-Nice to meet you.
-You, too.

41:17.208 --> 41:18.791
We were just in the neighborhood.

41:18.875 --> 41:20.750
Thought we'd try
one of those keto quiches.

41:20.833 --> 41:22.583
-Ah. Okay.
-I got to eat right now, you know,

41:22.666 --> 41:26.583
'cause he's trying to turn my body
from a ectomorph into a megamorph.

41:26.666 --> 41:27.708
Mesomorph.

41:27.791 --> 41:29.541
-Oh, a mesomorph. Right. Okay.
-Right?

41:29.625 --> 41:32.000
You guys want to grab a seat
and I'll get you something?

41:32.083 --> 41:34.041
-Sure.
-Thank you.

41:34.125 --> 41:35.666
Oh, buddy.

41:35.750 --> 41:37.583
-Whew! That was a big run.
-Gonna be okay?

41:37.666 --> 41:39.791
-No.
-(laughs)

41:39.875 --> 41:42.083
-This place is, um, really nice.
-Yeah.

41:42.166 --> 41:43.541
All righty, here we go.

41:43.625 --> 41:45.791
-Hey, thanks, babe.
-That is spinach and gruyere

41:45.875 --> 41:47.500
-with an almond flour crust.
-Oh, my God.

41:47.583 --> 41:49.500
Okay, this looks amazing. I'm gonna…

41:50.875 --> 41:52.750
Wo-- Wow.

41:52.833 --> 41:55.083
-You're telling me this is good for me?
-Yes, sir.

41:55.166 --> 41:56.916
-I don't believe it.
-Thanks.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.416
-Yeah.
-Um, great to meet you, Peter,

41:58.500 --> 42:00.500
but I have got to get back to work.

42:00.583 --> 42:02.166
-Nice to meet you as well. Yeah.
-Thanks, babe. -Mm-hmm.

42:02.250 --> 42:04.791
Wow, huh. Yeah.

42:04.875 --> 42:06.375
-She's impressive, huh?
-Mm-hmm.

42:06.458 --> 42:08.791
What about you?

42:08.875 --> 42:11.500
-You have a girlfriend?
-I did for a long time.

42:12.500 --> 42:15.875
But, um, she kind of ended things
with me recently.

42:15.958 --> 42:18.500
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you okay?

42:18.583 --> 42:20.208
Uh, no, not really.

42:20.291 --> 42:22.125
It's-- I just wasn't expecting it,

42:22.208 --> 42:24.375
so it's just a big adjustment, I guess.

42:24.458 --> 42:26.625
Yeah. That's a bummer, man.

42:26.708 --> 42:28.250
Yeah. Thanks.

42:28.333 --> 42:29.541
Well, you know what they say.

42:29.625 --> 42:31.666
You got to get back on the whores.

42:33.166 --> 42:35.708
Uh, I feel like you just said "whores."

42:35.791 --> 42:38.208
Yeah. Get back on the whores.

42:39.375 --> 42:41.875
Oh, no, well, the expression is "horse."

42:41.958 --> 42:44.666
Get back up on the horse.

42:44.750 --> 42:47.333
-No.
-Oh, yeah, it is.

42:48.833 --> 42:50.541
Why would you fuck a horse? (chuckles)

42:50.625 --> 42:52.833
You know, we-- move past it.

42:52.916 --> 42:54.333
-But I get your point. Yeah.
-Yeah.

42:54.416 --> 42:56.041
I think, uh, it's an older expression,
too, so…

42:56.125 --> 42:58.458
Um… yeah, just-- I don't know.

42:58.541 --> 43:01.041
I'm not ready for all that, but…

43:01.125 --> 43:03.541
Unless-- I don't know
how you feel about this,

43:03.625 --> 43:07.375
but maybe you and I could
go out together sometime,

43:07.458 --> 43:08.750
like, 'cause I bet you're a great wingman.

43:08.833 --> 43:09.916
Dude, I'm a great wingman.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.625
-Yeah.
-(chuckles): Yeah. Mm.

43:11.708 --> 43:12.833
You been to Halo before?

43:12.916 --> 43:14.583
-No. What is that?
-I'm taking you, bro.

43:14.666 --> 43:15.875
-It's gonna be awesome.
-Oh, yeah?

43:15.958 --> 43:17.458
Yeah. My buddy manages the place.

43:17.541 --> 43:19.250
He can totally hook us up, bottle service.

43:19.333 --> 43:21.541
-Oh, so it's like a club? Like a…
-Yeah.

43:21.625 --> 43:24.250
Oh, that'd be nice.
I haven't been to a club in, uh, ever?

43:24.333 --> 43:26.625
I've had a couple wild nights
there myself.

43:26.708 --> 43:29.083
Uh, who would do that, like,
you and your ex or, like, uh…

43:29.166 --> 43:31.083
Yeah, we've shut it down.

43:31.166 --> 43:33.125
-You guys had some good times. Cool, mm.
-Uh-huh.

43:33.208 --> 43:35.500
-Mm! Babe.
-Yeah?

43:35.583 --> 43:36.791
You want to go to Halo
with us this weekend?

43:36.875 --> 43:38.875
Blech. No. Absolutely not.
(inhales sharply)

43:38.958 --> 43:41.083
I need a shower
just thinking about that place.

43:41.166 --> 43:43.125
But, you guys, go, have a guys' night.

43:43.208 --> 43:44.333
Yeah.

43:44.416 --> 43:46.208
-Guys' night. Yeah.
-Yeah, it's more fun anyway.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.375
-You know, it's like, uh…
-It'll be cool.

43:47.458 --> 43:49.875
Ooh, after this, we should, uh…

43:49.958 --> 43:52.458
we should run back to the gym, you know?

43:52.541 --> 43:54.291
Fuck no.

43:54.375 --> 43:55.833
So I guess I'm gonna be a club guy now.

43:55.916 --> 44:00.291
You know, for a scummy nightclub,
that place is actually shockingly fun.

44:00.375 --> 44:01.666
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

44:01.750 --> 44:04.625
We used to be, like, the last two people
on the dance floor.

44:04.708 --> 44:07.625
Oh, you know what's funny?
He said something just like that.

44:07.708 --> 44:10.625
Yeah, that you supposedly, y-you guys
would shut it down or something like that.

44:10.708 --> 44:12.583
-He did?
-Yeah.

44:12.666 --> 44:13.791
And I think this could work, you know?

44:13.875 --> 44:15.916
This is probably, like-- it's just
what he needs to make him realize

44:16.000 --> 44:17.041
how much he misses you.

44:17.125 --> 44:21.375
And this dress is definitely
going to make Logan realize that

44:21.458 --> 44:25.208
he wants to take me out after rehearsal
for some drinks and some smooching.

44:25.291 --> 44:27.291
Okay, but won't Anne be at that rehearsal?

44:27.375 --> 44:29.708
No. She has parent-teacher conferences.

44:29.791 --> 44:31.583
-Look at you. Good work.
-Oh, yeah, man.

44:31.666 --> 44:32.875
I'm a psycho.

44:36.208 --> 44:37.458
(clears throat)

44:39.500 --> 44:40.625
Whoa.

44:40.708 --> 44:42.125
What? (chuckles)

44:42.208 --> 44:43.958
Um… uh, nothing.

44:44.041 --> 44:45.166
You look really good. Yeah.

44:45.250 --> 44:46.458
I mean, it looks great. Yeah.

44:46.541 --> 44:47.958
(chuckles):
I mean you look great.

44:48.041 --> 44:49.041
I know.

44:49.125 --> 44:50.125
(both laugh)

44:50.208 --> 44:52.041
Hey, what do we think about this, though?

44:52.125 --> 44:53.666
Does this say "night at the club"?

44:53.750 --> 44:56.375
Um… you look like Catwoman.

44:56.458 --> 44:57.833
And who likes the rum raisin?

44:57.916 --> 44:59.500
No one likes-- I don't know.
I mean, a raisin?

44:59.583 --> 45:01.750
-You're gonna put a raisin
in your ice cream? -Mm-mm.

45:01.833 --> 45:03.583
-(woman whimpers)
-Hey! Hey, watch where you're go--

45:03.666 --> 45:05.083
Are you okay?

45:05.166 --> 45:06.625
-Can I help you with this?
-Yeah.

45:06.708 --> 45:07.791
-Here.
-Thank you.

45:07.875 --> 45:10.000
(chuckles) Here.
There's a nice table over here, madame.

45:10.083 --> 45:11.541
I see the perfect spot for you.
Look at this.

45:11.625 --> 45:15.083
We got good natural light,
you know, we're away from the hooligans,

45:15.166 --> 45:17.500
and look at these guys over here.

45:17.583 --> 45:19.416
You can soak in the eye candy
while you eat.

45:19.500 --> 45:21.250
-There you go.
-Thank you.

45:21.333 --> 45:22.875
It's not too bright for you?
You all right?

45:22.958 --> 45:24.583
-Oh, yeah.
-Okay.

45:24.666 --> 45:27.500
-What an unusual young man you are.
-(laughs)

45:27.583 --> 45:29.458
I was going for charming,
but I'll take unusual.

45:29.541 --> 45:31.791
-Enjoy your lunch.
-(laughs) Thank you.

45:31.875 --> 45:33.708
-You saved her from those skateboarders.
-(laughs)

45:33.791 --> 45:36.125
-That was… -I-I saved her
from the evil street hoodlums.

45:36.208 --> 45:38.833
-You're adorable.
-Eh, I don't know.

45:38.916 --> 45:40.250
I love old people.

45:40.333 --> 45:42.583
-Oh, man.
-Which is actually deeply ironic

45:42.666 --> 45:45.583
because I make a living
helping an evil corporation earn millions

45:45.666 --> 45:48.833
by malnourishing
sweet, helpless grandparents.

45:48.916 --> 45:50.291
That's kind of my gig, you know?

45:50.375 --> 45:52.375
Why do you work there
if you hate it so much?

45:54.083 --> 45:56.250
Well, it was supposed to be
temporary, you know.

45:56.333 --> 45:59.291
I got… I got a master's degree
in public health,

45:59.375 --> 46:03.041
and I was gonna revolutionize
the way this country treats their elderly,

46:03.125 --> 46:07.583
but, you know, instead I took
the first job I was offered, and…

46:07.666 --> 46:09.666
and I just stayed
because I was too chickenshit

46:09.750 --> 46:12.250
to lose my cushy salary
and my good benefits.

46:12.333 --> 46:13.875
Mm.

46:13.958 --> 46:15.250
Sorry, hold on.

46:15.333 --> 46:21.125
Your life dream was to revolutionize
the way that we treat old people?

46:21.208 --> 46:23.416
I mean, both my parents
worked all the time,

46:23.500 --> 46:26.583
and they'd stick me in my grandmother's
retirement home most days after school.

46:26.666 --> 46:28.625
And we had fun, but it was sad in there.

46:28.708 --> 46:31.541
You know? It was this ugly,
weird-smelling building

46:31.625 --> 46:35.000
where all these old people with
incredible stories and so much wisdom,

46:35.083 --> 46:36.375
you know, they eat terrible food,

46:36.458 --> 46:38.458
they watch bad movies on basic cable,
and they wait to die.

46:38.541 --> 46:40.708
-Oh, Jesus.
-I know, yeah.

46:40.791 --> 46:44.458
So I decided one day
I would open my own retirement home.

46:44.541 --> 46:47.625
Eh, someplace that was, like,
affordable and cozy

46:47.708 --> 46:50.041
but somewhere where you would
actually like to wake up every day.

46:50.125 --> 46:53.708
That is so sweet and so weird.

46:53.791 --> 46:55.208
Okay, I can't tell
if you're making fun of me.

46:55.291 --> 46:56.458
-I'm not.
-(chuckles): Okay.

46:56.541 --> 46:58.875
I like it. I-I love your dream.

46:58.958 --> 47:01.250
Only I didn't do it, you know?

47:01.333 --> 47:03.083
And I became a part of the problem.

47:03.166 --> 47:05.333
Anne was right, you know? I…

47:05.416 --> 47:07.291
I am stuck.

47:07.375 --> 47:08.916
It's no wonder she broke up with me.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.708
Peter, stop. Stop it.

47:10.791 --> 47:12.333
-You're a total catch.
-Yeah?

47:12.416 --> 47:14.541
I mean, I do believe
you said I'm the kind of guy

47:14.625 --> 47:17.625
you could fall in love with
slowly after several years.

47:17.708 --> 47:19.000
You know, was it a hundred years?

47:19.083 --> 47:21.125
That's the best kind of guy, idiot.

47:21.208 --> 47:23.250
Anyone can be a one-night bang.

47:23.333 --> 47:27.333
But the slow burn
who gets under your skin,

47:27.416 --> 47:28.583
that's way more rare.

47:28.666 --> 47:31.125
That's your airplane safety mask person.

47:31.208 --> 47:32.333
(chuckles softly)

47:32.416 --> 47:33.500
Okay.

47:35.208 --> 47:36.416
(whispers):
So go get her.

47:37.708 --> 47:40.208
-Ask her out.
-Think I got a chance?

47:40.291 --> 47:41.500
Well, don't think too hard on it.

47:41.583 --> 47:43.125
I don't think you have that much time.

47:48.500 --> 47:50.875
So let's… let's get these.

47:50.958 --> 47:53.208
We need a… We really need a plan, man.

47:53.291 --> 47:55.875
-Oh, Logan, happy dress rehearsal.
-Hey.

47:55.958 --> 47:57.541
Oh, Emma, thank God you're here.

47:57.625 --> 47:59.375
-(chuckles softly)
-I need a huge favor.

47:59.458 --> 48:00.583
Anything.

48:00.666 --> 48:03.166
Audrey and one of our spotlight operators
have been hooking up.

48:03.250 --> 48:04.458
-Oh.
-Yeah.

48:04.541 --> 48:05.666
And they gave each other pink eye.

48:05.750 --> 48:07.583
-(whispers): Oh.
-Yeah.

48:07.666 --> 48:09.916
And so she's at home dealing with that.
(sighs)

48:10.000 --> 48:12.208
It's our only rehearsal with the band.

48:12.291 --> 48:14.208
You've seen this blocking so many times.

48:14.291 --> 48:15.875
-You played her back in high school.
-Oh…

48:15.958 --> 48:17.041
You could fill in. Please?

48:17.125 --> 48:18.958
-Oh, no, no, no.
-Oh, please.

48:19.041 --> 48:20.958
It's-it's really just for the music cues.

48:21.041 --> 48:22.958
You can even hold the script.
It'll be fun.

48:23.041 --> 48:24.750
I guess…

48:24.833 --> 48:25.833
-Yes! Okay.
-Oh.

48:25.916 --> 48:27.125
-Costume is backstage.
-No?

48:27.208 --> 48:28.291
You are a lifesaver.

48:28.375 --> 48:29.791
-(laughs)
-Thank you.

48:31.291 --> 48:33.291
A costume?

48:34.875 --> 48:37.208
-(lively chatter)

48:41.875 --> 48:44.208
("Troubled Paradise" by Slayyyter playing)

48:44.291 --> 48:46.625
What? Dude, how have I
never been to this place?

48:46.708 --> 48:47.916
This is awesome, man!

48:48.000 --> 48:50.833
I-- Dude, I can't believe
Ginny's not into it, right?

48:50.916 --> 48:52.541
Are you ready to give
all this up, you know?

48:52.625 --> 48:55.541
Popping bottles with the boys,
grinding with the honeys.

48:55.625 --> 48:57.166
(chuckles):
Dude, this is gold.

48:57.250 --> 49:00.083
Don't waste this on me.
We got to introduce you to some girls.

49:00.166 --> 49:02.083
-(electronic dance music playing)
-(crowd cheering)

49:05.166 --> 49:06.416
-Hey.
-Hey.

49:06.500 --> 49:07.666
Want to take a shot?

49:07.750 --> 49:08.750
Yeah?

49:08.833 --> 49:11.000
-Why don't you with my buddy.
-Oh, no.

49:11.083 --> 49:13.291
-Okay. All right. Uh, yeah.
-You two.

49:13.375 --> 49:15.083
Hey. Cheers.

49:17.458 --> 49:19.833
What's your name-- Oh. All right.

49:19.916 --> 49:21.166
And goodbye.

49:23.541 --> 49:25.083
-(whoops)

49:26.541 --> 49:27.958
-(laughing)

49:29.791 --> 49:30.791
-(whooping)

49:35.458 --> 49:37.458
(quiet chatter)

49:50.166 --> 49:52.125
Is this one of those moments
of being a grown-up

49:52.208 --> 49:54.500
where you realize you don't know
what you're doing with your life?

49:54.583 --> 49:56.083
Oh, okay. It's--

49:56.166 --> 49:58.250
Yes. Yes.

49:58.333 --> 49:59.750
I called my dad.

49:59.833 --> 50:01.208
It went all right.

50:01.291 --> 50:03.208
Trevor, that's great.

50:03.291 --> 50:04.916
He asked if we could have dinner,
but he said if I'm not ready yet,

50:05.000 --> 50:06.000
that's cool, too.

50:06.083 --> 50:07.708
Mm-hmm.

50:07.791 --> 50:09.750
I think I'm gonna let him take me
to Olive Garden for ravioli night.

50:09.833 --> 50:11.458
Oh, heck yeah, you are.

50:16.000 --> 50:17.791
Oh, shit, I got to go move
the fucking plant.

50:17.875 --> 50:19.375
-So I'm gonna go home.
-(chuckles)

50:19.458 --> 50:21.833
(ringtone playing)

50:27.583 --> 50:29.958
What? Hey there, stranger.

50:30.041 --> 50:32.333
(hip-hop music playing over phone)

50:32.416 --> 50:34.166
Hello? Noah?

50:34.250 --> 50:36.166
-Don't give him that.
-Get a picture!

50:36.250 --> 50:37.916
-(laughing)
-(hip-hop music playing loudly)

50:38.000 --> 50:39.583
(Peter laughing)

50:39.666 --> 50:41.083
Noah? Hello?

50:41.166 --> 50:42.750
-Emma?
-Hello?

50:42.833 --> 50:43.875
Emma?

50:43.958 --> 50:45.208
I think he got it.

50:45.291 --> 50:47.458
-Emma?
-Noah?

50:47.541 --> 50:49.375
Hey. Can you hear me?

50:49.458 --> 50:51.166
-What?
-Hey.

50:51.250 --> 50:55.458
Uh, sorry, I-I think I must've
pocket-dialed you while I was dancing.

50:55.541 --> 50:56.541
Oh.

50:56.625 --> 50:57.958
(laughs):
Oh, no.

50:58.041 --> 51:00.291
That's so-- I think I pocket-answered.

51:00.375 --> 51:02.250
-I'm at a dinner party.
-(boy screams dramatically)

51:02.333 --> 51:04.458
-Cool.
-Uh, may I have a--

51:04.541 --> 51:06.708
the signature cocktail this time?

51:06.791 --> 51:10.708
Sorry, there's a mixologist here,
and it's… (laughs) it's very fancy.

51:10.791 --> 51:13.458
Oh, that's-that's cool. That sounds fun.

51:13.541 --> 51:15.416
Uh, how are you doing?

51:15.500 --> 51:17.500
Oh, um…

51:17.583 --> 51:18.833
I'm fine.

51:18.916 --> 51:21.166
-Doing really well.
-Awesome.

51:21.250 --> 51:23.208
Um, look, I got to go.

51:23.291 --> 51:24.708
We should really catch up soon.

51:24.791 --> 51:26.458
Yeah, I would love that.

51:26.541 --> 51:27.958
Okay.

51:28.041 --> 51:31.041
Do you want to, like, make a time or-or--

51:31.125 --> 51:33.250
Hello? Hello?

51:40.208 --> 51:41.208
Are you okay?

51:42.833 --> 51:46.125
(scoffs) Mind your business, Eric.

51:56.666 --> 51:57.916
-Audrey, that's your cue.
-Huh?

51:58.000 --> 51:59.666
On, you're-- okay.

52:00.791 --> 52:01.958
Just…

52:02.041 --> 52:04.041
Are you-- Is someone-- Oh.

52:09.333 --> 52:11.041
Um, should I…

52:11.125 --> 52:13.458
-(piano playing gentle intro)
-(whispers): Logan. Should…

52:16.166 --> 52:18.416
(sobbing softly)

52:18.500 --> 52:20.916
This is literally what people have
nightmares about.

52:21.000 --> 52:23.000
(piano continues gentle intro)

52:27.791 --> 52:29.666
-Oh! My God.

52:33.000 --> 52:34.625
-(sniffles)

52:36.791 --> 52:37.958
(groans)

52:48.833 --> 52:49.833
(smacks lips)

52:49.916 --> 52:51.125
I can't take this. (sniffles)

52:51.208 --> 52:54.000
-(clears throat)

52:54.083 --> 52:55.791
(chuckles softly)

53:22.083 --> 53:23.541
Am I gonna sing this?

53:26.416 --> 53:29.083
Oops.

53:31.666 --> 53:33.875
Sad.

54:18.000 --> 54:19.125
Oh, here?

54:52.416 --> 54:54.208
(music builds)

55:27.541 --> 55:30.541
-(continues holding note)
-(music crescendos)

55:34.000 --> 55:35.250
-(music ends)
-(sobs)

55:35.333 --> 55:36.583
(scattered applause)

55:36.666 --> 55:38.875
I really needed that, I guess.

55:38.958 --> 55:40.125
Okay, wow.

55:40.208 --> 55:41.458
Um, everyone, let's-let's take five.

55:43.125 --> 55:45.041
Um, you… Okay.

55:45.125 --> 55:46.500
Um, Emma, that was, um…

55:46.583 --> 55:47.666
Really weird.

55:47.750 --> 55:48.916
Definitely not
what you were asking me to…

55:49.000 --> 55:52.166
I was going to say it was
an amazingly powerful interpretation.

55:52.250 --> 55:53.833
-Oh.
-Yes?

55:53.916 --> 55:55.458
-Yes.
-You were channeling

55:55.541 --> 55:58.375
all of Audrey's pain
and… and vulnerability.

56:00.166 --> 56:01.458
It was beautiful.

56:01.541 --> 56:03.625
Thank you so much.

56:03.708 --> 56:05.583
Uh…

56:05.666 --> 56:10.208
would you like to have a drink after this
to celebrate how beautiful I just was?

56:10.291 --> 56:11.958
Absolutely. I would love that.

56:12.041 --> 56:14.125
Wow, great. (chuckles)

56:14.208 --> 56:15.583
Let me text Anne,
see if she wants to join.

56:15.666 --> 56:18.875
Yeah, well, I mean, she wasn't really part
of when I was beautiful before.

56:18.958 --> 56:20.416
(whispers):
Damn.

56:20.500 --> 56:21.500
(grunts softly)

56:21.583 --> 56:23.291
-You mind if I stick this--
-("Yee" by Deorro playing)

56:23.375 --> 56:25.083
I-I'm gonna steal your chair.

56:25.166 --> 56:26.708
Oh, my God, I love this place!

56:26.791 --> 56:28.000
-It's crazy, you know?
-(whoops)

56:28.083 --> 56:30.958
I feel, like, Italian or something.

56:31.041 --> 56:34.958
Yeah. You are so adorable.

56:35.041 --> 56:36.583
-Ah, get out of here. Thanks.
-No, no.

56:36.666 --> 56:41.166
You remind me of that little
singing, uh, cartoon gerbil.

56:41.250 --> 56:43.125
Oh, what is his name?

56:43.208 --> 56:45.166
Alvin the Chipmunk?

56:45.250 --> 56:47.333
-Yes! Yes!
-Okay. (laughs)

56:47.416 --> 56:49.083
Oh, I love that little guy.

56:49.166 --> 56:50.500
This bottle's dead.
Should we get another one?

56:50.583 --> 56:52.541
No, this place is lame.
Let's get out of here.

56:52.625 --> 56:54.708
Oh, well, okay, well, get home safe.
Nice meeting you and, uh…

56:54.791 --> 56:57.041
No, no, no, no. She meant all of us.

56:57.125 --> 56:59.625
Yeah, we can go back to our place.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.708
Oh, yeah, uh… that sounds fun.

57:03.791 --> 57:06.416
Let… let me talk that over
with my friend really quick just to…

57:06.500 --> 57:08.291
-Okay. Okay.
-Okay.

57:08.375 --> 57:10.166
Grab your things.

57:10.250 --> 57:12.208
Uh…

57:12.291 --> 57:13.375
What? What?

57:13.458 --> 57:14.708
You got to go.

57:14.791 --> 57:15.916
I'm gonna go, yeah.
What the hell are you talking about?

57:16.000 --> 57:17.916
-You're gonna come with me, though, right?
-I can't.

57:18.000 --> 57:20.166
-I shouldn't.
-Why not?

57:20.250 --> 57:21.291
Well, you know, Ginny…

57:21.375 --> 57:23.083
Come on, man.
You promised to be my wingman.

57:23.166 --> 57:24.208
I can't go alone.

57:24.291 --> 57:25.833
I won't let you do anything stupid.

57:25.916 --> 57:27.500
I just-- I need my wingman, right?

57:27.583 --> 57:29.708
I'll do it for you. Let's go.

57:29.791 --> 57:32.125
-(laughs) We're in!
-But I got to be good.

57:32.208 --> 57:34.000
-No, yeah. You're Mr. Good.
-Yes! -Yes?

57:34.083 --> 57:36.375
-Here he comes! We're in! Yeah!
-(cheering)

57:36.458 --> 57:40.458
So, after Virginia Woolf,
we're planning on going to Europe.

57:40.541 --> 57:41.583
-Yes, yes.
-Ooh.

57:41.666 --> 57:44.250
I've just been dying to study
commedia dell'arte in Florence.

57:44.333 --> 57:45.583
-Oh.
-Oh, yes.

57:45.666 --> 57:48.125
-I love, love, love Firenze.
-Yeah.

57:48.208 --> 57:50.666
What a nice way to say that.

57:50.750 --> 57:52.708
-The food, the wine…
-Ah. Yes.

57:52.791 --> 57:54.041
…the women.

57:54.125 --> 57:56.291
Uh, just for looking, of course.

57:56.375 --> 57:57.500
(Logan chuckles)

57:57.583 --> 58:00.250
She, uh, gets a little jealous.

58:01.583 --> 58:03.458
What? I don't get jealous.

58:03.541 --> 58:05.041
Uh, did I say "jealous"?

58:05.125 --> 58:07.000
-No, no, no. I-I meant…
-(laughs)

58:07.083 --> 58:09.083
I am having the best time with you guys.

58:09.166 --> 58:10.958
(sighs) Me, too.

58:11.041 --> 58:13.750
And hold on one moment
while I just give myself

58:13.833 --> 58:17.041
a dose of liquid courage here, but, um…

58:17.125 --> 58:18.708
(chuckles) Sorry. I…

58:19.791 --> 58:21.541
Mmm. Okay.

58:21.625 --> 58:24.375
I find you both to be…

58:25.916 --> 58:27.500
…incredibly attractive.

58:27.583 --> 58:30.708
-Hmm.
-And, um…

58:30.791 --> 58:34.625
I'm wondering, uh,
how you would feel about me,

58:34.708 --> 58:37.750
sometime, maybe…

58:37.833 --> 58:39.208
joining you in your bed.

58:42.000 --> 58:43.458
-Oh, wow.
-(Emma chuckles)

58:43.541 --> 58:44.666
Wow.

58:44.750 --> 58:46.166
(Emma and Logan chuckle)

58:46.250 --> 58:49.333
Um, well, first of all,
thank you for sharing that.

58:49.416 --> 58:50.458
You're welcome.

58:50.541 --> 58:52.750
Um, to be honest, I was expecting this.

58:52.833 --> 58:54.833
-Really?
-Yeah, yeah.

58:54.916 --> 58:56.125
It's definitely something I'm open to.

58:56.208 --> 58:59.000
I've had quite a few threesomes in
the past and some really great memories.

58:59.083 --> 59:01.166
-Yeah.
-Uh, but, Anne, Anne, um…

59:01.250 --> 59:03.000
-What do you think?
-Mm. What do I think?

59:03.083 --> 59:04.791
Yeah. Uh, well, I mean,
you are always saying

59:04.875 --> 59:08.000
that you want to explore
new parts of yourself.

59:08.083 --> 59:10.083
-(chuckles) -Right?
-No, I want to.

59:10.166 --> 59:11.458
You're right. I've been talking about--

59:11.541 --> 59:13.291
We've been talking about it,
and so I do, I want to.

59:13.375 --> 59:14.791
-Wow.
-But not tonight

59:14.875 --> 59:16.708
'cause I haven't, liked,
shaved or anything in like…

59:16.791 --> 59:19.000
Great, then how about next weekend?

59:19.083 --> 59:20.458
Opening night of the musical.

59:20.541 --> 59:21.750
-Yes.
-We can celebrate.

59:21.833 --> 59:23.000
To celebrate, yeah.

59:23.083 --> 59:25.041
Yeah, sure.

59:25.125 --> 59:29.416
Let's all have sex to celebrate
middle schoolers. (laughs)

59:29.500 --> 59:32.041
-- Yeah.
-- This is where we live.

59:32.125 --> 59:33.125
-Wow.
-Wow.

59:33.208 --> 59:34.208
You want to come sit with us?

59:34.291 --> 59:36.875
-Hop on.
-I'll just maybe

59:36.958 --> 59:38.916
stand up, stretch a little.

59:39.000 --> 59:41.666
-Yeah. -What? We don't bite.
-Unless you want us to.

59:41.750 --> 59:43.625
This is, uh, this is a really nice place.

59:43.708 --> 59:45.375
What is it you do for work again?

59:45.458 --> 59:47.250
Uh, Chloe is a clothing designer.

59:47.333 --> 59:48.916
-Taylor and I work in PR.
-Wow.

59:49.000 --> 59:51.416
Who wants shots?!

59:51.500 --> 59:52.875
-(others whooping, cheering)
-Oh!

59:52.958 --> 59:55.041
-Yeah, Noah, we should do one together.
-Shot, shot, shot. -Okay, yeah.

59:55.125 --> 59:56.541
-Sure.
-All right. Okay.

59:56.625 --> 1:00:00.250
Hey, to our hot new friends.

1:00:00.333 --> 1:00:02.041
All right. I guess that's us. (laughs)

1:00:02.125 --> 1:00:04.000
(others whooping)

1:00:04.083 --> 1:00:06.041
Knock-knock, motherfuckers!

1:00:06.125 --> 1:00:08.666
Oh, Jesus, you invited
Jase and the guys over?

1:00:08.750 --> 1:00:10.041
He has Molly.

1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.000
Yay, you're here!

1:00:13.083 --> 1:00:14.333
(excited chatter)

1:00:14.416 --> 1:00:16.000
-(laughing)
-(chuckles nervously)

1:00:16.083 --> 1:00:17.625
Who are the old dudes?

1:00:17.708 --> 1:00:19.958
These are dope.
I got these from my brother's stepdad.

1:00:20.041 --> 1:00:21.791
-Ooh. -Yes, sir.
-Yeah, yeah.

1:00:21.875 --> 1:00:24.041
-So your stepdad?
-Nah.

1:00:24.125 --> 1:00:25.583
-Oh.
-Mm.

1:00:25.666 --> 1:00:26.791
All right, enjoy.

1:00:26.875 --> 1:00:28.541
Uh, hey, man, have you,
have you done Molly before?

1:00:28.625 --> 1:00:30.875
-Not since Stagecoach.
-Take it.

1:00:30.958 --> 1:00:32.250
-Come on!
-Come on!

1:00:32.333 --> 1:00:33.958
(others cheering)

1:00:34.041 --> 1:00:35.833
Let's go dance!

1:00:35.916 --> 1:00:37.000
-(others whooping)
-Yeah!

1:00:37.083 --> 1:00:38.125
Here's nothing.

1:00:38.208 --> 1:00:39.333
-All right. All right.
-Come on. Come on.

1:00:39.416 --> 1:00:40.500
-Oh, where we going?
-That's right, do that.

1:00:40.583 --> 1:00:41.958
So, uh, you and Leighton, huh?

1:00:42.041 --> 1:00:43.041
That's-that's cool, that's cool.

1:00:43.125 --> 1:00:45.250
(chuckles):
Oh, yeah. Oh, I don't know. Yeah.

1:00:45.333 --> 1:00:46.750
Yeah, well, she used to be my girlfriend.

1:00:46.833 --> 1:00:48.833
-Oh, um…
-Yeah.

1:00:48.916 --> 1:00:50.083
Uh, cool. Well, you know what?

1:00:50.166 --> 1:00:52.291
I-I actually just met her,
so I don't really…

1:00:52.375 --> 1:00:53.875
(scoffs) That's-that's cool, man.

1:00:53.958 --> 1:00:55.125
-Yeah, nothing's really happening.
-That's cool. That's cool.

1:00:55.208 --> 1:00:56.583
So she ever mention me, like?

1:00:56.666 --> 1:00:59.416
Uh, well, uh, you know,
I've only known her for like two hours.

1:00:59.500 --> 1:01:02.041
Oh, so that, so that's a no.
Okay, okay, cool.

1:01:02.125 --> 1:01:03.125
-Yeah, it's a no because…
-No, it's cool.

1:01:03.208 --> 1:01:05.250
I haven't seen her since
she actually, like, broke up with me.

1:01:05.333 --> 1:01:07.458
-Yeah, so…
-Okay, so this is fresh.

1:01:07.541 --> 1:01:09.000
-It-it wouldn't have worked out
anyway, you know. -Ah.

1:01:09.083 --> 1:01:10.875
We, uh, we had different love languages.

1:01:10.958 --> 1:01:13.041
-You know.
-Sure, you know.

1:01:13.125 --> 1:01:15.625
Um, hey, you, uh,
you didn't take your pill, man.

1:01:15.708 --> 1:01:18.208
Oh, yeah. You know, um,
I've-I've never done Molly, so…

1:01:18.291 --> 1:01:19.666
-Okay.
-I don't know.

1:01:19.750 --> 1:01:23.000
Like, is my heart gonna explode
if I, uh, take this?

1:01:23.083 --> 1:01:24.208
(laughs):
Oh, no, no.

1:01:24.291 --> 1:01:25.416
You're thinking of crack, bro.

1:01:25.500 --> 1:01:26.791
-That's what it was.
-You're fine.

1:01:26.875 --> 1:01:28.291
-Just pop it. You're cool, man.
-Yeah. Okay.

1:01:28.375 --> 1:01:30.166
-Here we go. Down the, down the hatch.
-Yeah. To Leighton.

1:01:30.250 --> 1:01:31.291
Huh?

1:01:31.375 --> 1:01:33.000
The love of my life.

1:01:34.458 --> 1:01:35.500
(dance music playing in distance)

1:01:35.583 --> 1:01:39.500
I can feel my heart beating in my eyes.

1:01:39.583 --> 1:01:41.166
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

1:01:41.250 --> 1:01:43.666
-If I'm being perfectly honest…
-Mm-hmm?

1:01:44.666 --> 1:01:46.291
…I can smell the moon right now.

1:01:46.375 --> 1:01:49.208
-No. (inhales deeply)
-Which I didn't know was a thing.

1:01:49.291 --> 1:01:51.458
You know, I bet this is
what it's like to be a dog.

1:01:51.541 --> 1:01:53.125
-Oh, man, yeah.
-Yo!

1:01:53.208 --> 1:01:54.666
-Yo!
-(Leighton gasps)

1:01:54.750 --> 1:01:56.458
-Where's my buddy?!
-Uh, what is that?

1:01:56.541 --> 1:01:57.750
-What is that?
-Yo, where's my new friend? -Whoo.

1:01:57.833 --> 1:01:59.416
-Peter? -(gasps)
-Whoa.

1:01:59.500 --> 1:02:00.833
-Oh, there he is.
-Hey.

1:02:00.916 --> 1:02:02.583
-Peter!
-What are you doing, man?

1:02:02.666 --> 1:02:04.666
Don't worry, don't worry.
We do this all the time.

1:02:04.750 --> 1:02:06.291
No! No.

1:02:06.375 --> 1:02:08.375
Y-You're not gonna make it
in the pool from there.

1:02:08.458 --> 1:02:10.708
The pool? I'm not jumping in the pool.

1:02:10.791 --> 1:02:12.458
I'm jumping in the hot tub, dude.

1:02:12.541 --> 1:02:13.625
I'm tub jumping!

1:02:13.708 --> 1:02:15.208
Oh!

1:02:15.291 --> 1:02:16.333
No!

1:02:16.416 --> 1:02:18.208
-Yes.
-There's not enough water in there, man.

1:02:18.291 --> 1:02:19.666
-Don't do it.
-Do it.

1:02:19.750 --> 1:02:21.291
-Do not do it.
-Do it.

1:02:21.375 --> 1:02:23.000
It's what Leighton wants. I got to do it.

1:02:23.083 --> 1:02:24.083
You heard her.

1:02:24.166 --> 1:02:27.166
Look, hey, look, we've all had
a lot of fun tonight, you know,

1:02:27.250 --> 1:02:28.916
but maybe just step back down.

1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.125
I think they got Scrabble inside.
Let's just…

1:02:31.208 --> 1:02:32.416
-Tub jump!
-No, no, no, no.

1:02:32.500 --> 1:02:35.458
-No! No, no, no! No.
-Yeah! (whoops)

1:02:35.541 --> 1:02:37.041
(both gasp)

1:02:37.125 --> 1:02:39.041
-Is he dead?
-Maybe.

1:02:40.125 --> 1:02:41.333
Tub jump!

1:02:41.416 --> 1:02:43.166
Trust me. It's totally safe.

1:02:43.250 --> 1:02:44.375
Okay.

1:02:44.458 --> 1:02:47.375
As long as you, like, tuck your knees in
and protect your neck.

1:02:47.458 --> 1:02:48.666
-Protect my neck? Holy shit.
-Oh, yeah.

1:02:48.750 --> 1:02:49.750
What happens if you miss?

1:02:49.833 --> 1:02:51.458
Oh, no, do not miss.

1:02:51.541 --> 1:02:54.583
-I can-- I cannot bleach blood
out of the patio again. -Oh, shit.

1:02:54.666 --> 1:02:56.125
-Tub jump!
-Whoa, you all right?

1:02:56.208 --> 1:02:57.666
-(water splashes) -I'm okay.
-Whoa, there he went.

1:02:57.750 --> 1:02:59.750
-(whoops) Come on, let's go!
-There he goes.

1:02:59.833 --> 1:03:01.791
Pop that shirt off!

1:03:01.875 --> 1:03:02.916
-All right.
-(laughs)

1:03:03.000 --> 1:03:04.541
Why's everyone always want me
to pop my shirt off?

1:03:04.625 --> 1:03:06.416
Hi! I'm coming!

1:03:06.500 --> 1:03:08.041
And where is Noah?

1:03:08.125 --> 1:03:10.666
This couch is everything.

1:03:10.750 --> 1:03:12.291
-I could be your everything.
-Hi.

1:03:12.375 --> 1:03:13.458
-Oh. Hi. (chuckles)
-(chuckles)

1:03:13.541 --> 1:03:15.041
-Where did you come from?
-(laughing)

1:03:15.125 --> 1:03:17.416
-Do you want to dance?
-(gasps) Oh, my God, we should dance.

1:03:17.500 --> 1:03:18.583
I love to dance.

1:03:18.666 --> 1:03:20.041
Ooh, that's far.

1:03:20.125 --> 1:03:21.833
-- Jump! -- Come on!
-- You'll love it. -Okay.

1:03:21.916 --> 1:03:23.791
-Come on, Peter! You can do this!
-Come on! -You got it!

1:03:23.875 --> 1:03:25.708
-It seems very shallow.
-You got it!

1:03:25.791 --> 1:03:27.041
I'm gonna go for the pool.

1:03:27.125 --> 1:03:28.583
No, no, no, no, no!

1:03:28.666 --> 1:03:30.208
Do not go for the pool, okay?

1:03:30.291 --> 1:03:31.625
That's how Miles got hurt.

1:03:31.708 --> 1:03:33.083
-He's in a wheelchair now.
-Yeah.

1:03:33.166 --> 1:03:34.208
Is he?

1:03:34.291 --> 1:03:35.625
-Yeah. -Yeah.
-Okay.

1:03:35.708 --> 1:03:36.875
-Jump! Jump!
-I can't believe that you'd rather

1:03:36.958 --> 1:03:38.125
be with this guy than with me.

1:03:38.208 --> 1:03:39.250
-Jump, Peter! -This is ridiculous.
-Jump!

1:03:39.333 --> 1:03:42.083
By the way, I haven't achieved
my workout goals yet. I…

1:03:42.166 --> 1:03:43.625
Can we just talk about this later?
It's fine.

1:03:43.708 --> 1:03:45.291
No, let's talk about this now,
while he's up there.

1:03:45.375 --> 1:03:46.625
You guys are on your own thing?

1:03:46.708 --> 1:03:47.791
-'Cause I can go back.
-Come on!

1:03:47.875 --> 1:03:49.125
-No-no-no-no-no-no-no!
-No, no, no, no!

1:03:49.208 --> 1:03:50.333
-Okay. No? Stay out?
-Come on! Come on!

1:03:50.416 --> 1:03:51.791
-No, you can do it! -Jump!
-Okay. All right.

1:03:51.875 --> 1:03:54.666
-GROUP (chanting): Jump! Jump! Jump! Jump!
-All right. Ooh.

1:03:54.750 --> 1:03:56.291
-I love you. I love you so much.
-(chanting continues)

1:03:56.375 --> 1:03:57.583
I love you so much, Leighton.

1:03:57.666 --> 1:03:59.166
-Shut up.
-Just please give me another chance.

1:03:59.250 --> 1:04:00.958
-Whew.
-Please. I'll stop stealing from you.

1:04:01.041 --> 1:04:02.500
-Whatever you want.
-I'm doing it.

1:04:02.583 --> 1:04:03.750
Here I go.

1:04:03.833 --> 1:04:05.666
(whoops)

1:04:06.750 --> 1:04:08.791
(cheering)

1:04:08.875 --> 1:04:10.708
(whooping)

1:04:10.791 --> 1:04:13.791
I'm alive! I'm alive!

1:04:13.875 --> 1:04:16.416
-Oh, my God, I can't believe I did that!
-(laughing)

1:04:16.500 --> 1:04:17.666
(panting) Whoa!

1:04:17.750 --> 1:04:18.791
Oh, my God.

1:04:18.875 --> 1:04:20.833
I mean, Anne thinks
I never do anything spontaneous.

1:04:20.916 --> 1:04:21.958
You know what I mean?

1:04:22.041 --> 1:04:24.500
-Yeah. -Oh, my God, she hated
listening to me complain about my job,

1:04:24.583 --> 1:04:26.041
always eating the same salmon

1:04:26.125 --> 1:04:27.666
and pretty much everything else
about our life together.

1:04:27.750 --> 1:04:30.041
-But, you know, I think things are
gonna be different now… -Uh-huh.

1:04:30.125 --> 1:04:31.250
…'cause I just jumped into a hot tub!

1:04:31.333 --> 1:04:32.375
I mean, thank you so much.

1:04:32.458 --> 1:04:35.375
Yeah, no, you're-you're totally welcome,

1:04:35.458 --> 1:04:38.666
but, um, like, who's Anne? (chuckles)

1:04:38.750 --> 1:04:41.166
-Hang on a second. Uh…
-Yeah?

1:04:41.250 --> 1:04:44.125
What PR firm did you say
you worked at again?

1:04:44.208 --> 1:04:47.958
Oh, we work at Goldman Personal Research.

1:04:49.208 --> 1:04:51.875
Th-That is, that is not
what "PR" stands for.

1:04:51.958 --> 1:04:53.416
That's not even close.
Oh, my God, how old are you?

1:04:53.500 --> 1:04:54.791
Twenty-three.

1:04:54.875 --> 1:04:56.833
How old are you really?

1:04:58.291 --> 1:04:59.666
Okay, fine, I'm 19.

1:04:59.750 --> 1:05:02.250
(Leighton laughs)

1:05:02.333 --> 1:05:04.166
-I'm-I'm 17.
-Oh, my God.

1:05:04.250 --> 1:05:06.166
-Oh, my God! Noah, they're in high school!
-Okay.

1:05:06.250 --> 1:05:08.875
-(vehicle approaching)
-Oh, fuck, my dad's home!

1:05:08.958 --> 1:05:10.875
Oh, shit! Her dad sucks!

1:05:10.958 --> 1:05:12.000
Noah!

1:05:12.083 --> 1:05:13.750
-Oh, my God. See, I knew this house
was too nice. -(mutters) Oh, shit!

1:05:13.833 --> 1:05:16.125
-Noah, these are children!
-Oh, my God!

1:05:16.208 --> 1:05:18.000
-(dance music playing)
-Noah!

1:05:18.083 --> 1:05:19.500
-We got to go!
-Pete.

1:05:19.583 --> 1:05:20.875
You took your shirt off.

1:05:20.958 --> 1:05:22.458
Yeah, I took my shirt off. They're 17!

1:05:22.541 --> 1:05:24.708
-17 what?
-Years old, man! We got to go!

1:05:24.791 --> 1:05:26.208
-Sorry.
-No.

1:05:26.291 --> 1:05:27.750
Get your shit! Go, let's move!

1:05:27.833 --> 1:05:28.958
-Oh, God.
-(music stops)

1:05:29.041 --> 1:05:31.458
Uh… hello.

1:05:31.541 --> 1:05:33.625
-Again?
-No, don't…

1:05:33.708 --> 1:05:35.125
don't be mad, Daddy.

1:05:35.208 --> 1:05:36.791
How old are you?

1:05:36.875 --> 1:05:39.208
-I'm 17 years old.
-You're 17 years old?

1:05:39.291 --> 1:05:40.791
-Sir, if I could explain to you the…
-No, no, no.

1:05:40.875 --> 1:05:42.875
You do not get to call me "sir."
We're peers.

1:05:42.958 --> 1:05:44.750
What the fuck are you doing
with a bunch of teenage girls?

1:05:44.833 --> 1:05:46.708
-Well, okay, first of all…
-We didn't know how old they were.

1:05:46.791 --> 1:05:47.833
We did not.

1:05:47.916 --> 1:05:48.958
-No.
-Okay, and…

1:05:49.041 --> 1:05:50.083
-They tricked us.
-They did trick us.

1:05:50.166 --> 1:05:51.208
Just tell him the truth.

1:05:51.291 --> 1:05:52.958
-Just tell him the truth.
-Here's the thing. (stammers)

1:05:53.041 --> 1:05:54.916
I want what you have in life, you know?

1:05:55.000 --> 1:05:56.583
Uh, I want your house, you know?

1:05:56.666 --> 1:05:57.791
You want my house?

1:05:57.875 --> 1:05:59.083
I want a daughter, you know?

1:05:59.166 --> 1:06:00.791
Um, not your daughter. I want a daughter.

1:06:00.875 --> 1:06:02.333
You know, like-like a little girl,
you know?

1:06:02.416 --> 1:06:03.583
I'm sorry, what?

1:06:03.666 --> 1:06:05.000
-Even a little boy would be fun
to play with. -Okay…

1:06:05.083 --> 1:06:06.375
What the fuck does that mean?

1:06:06.458 --> 1:06:07.833
What does that mean?

1:06:07.916 --> 1:06:10.541
Uh, um, it doesn't mean that
I want your daughter to be my daughter.

1:06:10.625 --> 1:06:12.666
You got to help me out here, man,
because I don't really know what's…

1:06:12.750 --> 1:06:14.916
Everyone, just calm down.

1:06:15.000 --> 1:06:16.041
-Yeah.
-All right?

1:06:16.125 --> 1:06:17.666
I'm calm.

1:06:17.750 --> 1:06:18.750
-I…
-Run!

1:06:18.833 --> 1:06:20.166
What the fuck was that?!

1:06:20.250 --> 1:06:21.625
(stammers) Potpourri?!

1:06:24.291 --> 1:06:27.000
Dude, your stamina's really improved.

1:06:27.083 --> 1:06:28.291
-That's the drugs!
-Oh.

1:06:28.375 --> 1:06:30.375
(panting)

1:06:30.458 --> 1:06:32.458
(sniffles)

1:06:32.541 --> 1:06:34.875
I'm sorry things didn't work out
with Leighton.

1:06:34.958 --> 1:06:36.958
I really wanted that for you.

1:06:37.041 --> 1:06:40.250
Yeah, well, she was in high school,
so that's probably for the best.

1:06:40.333 --> 1:06:41.583
Yeah.

1:06:43.500 --> 1:06:45.666
(sighs heavily)

1:06:45.750 --> 1:06:47.875
-(whispers): Man.
-(sniffles)

1:06:47.958 --> 1:06:50.833
I almost did something really stupid
back there with those girls.

1:06:52.333 --> 1:06:53.541
Oh, yeah?

1:06:54.541 --> 1:06:56.666
Well, you know, maybe that…

1:06:56.750 --> 1:06:59.958
maybe that means you're not ready
to settle down just yet, huh?

1:07:00.041 --> 1:07:01.250
No.

1:07:01.333 --> 1:07:03.833
No, if anything,
tonight was a major wake-up call.

1:07:03.916 --> 1:07:05.958
-I mean… -Tonight was a wake-up call.
I'll give you that. (chuckles)

1:07:06.041 --> 1:07:07.083
Holy shit.

1:07:07.166 --> 1:07:10.416
Oh, and-and what you said back there
about, you know, wanting a daughter…

1:07:10.500 --> 1:07:13.333
Ah, dude, uh, what was I saying, man?
I was talking off my head.

1:07:13.416 --> 1:07:16.875
No, no, you were, like,
making all the sense in the world.

1:07:16.958 --> 1:07:18.250
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

1:07:18.333 --> 1:07:20.125
Like, I-I know, as guys,

1:07:20.208 --> 1:07:24.791
we're, like, supposed to be afraid
of commitment or whatever, but…

1:07:24.875 --> 1:07:26.708
-I want that, too.
-That's not that crazy, right?

1:07:26.791 --> 1:07:27.916
-Like…
-No.

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:29.958
I'm ready for all that.

1:07:30.041 --> 1:07:33.750
I'm ready for… the kid
and the, and the house

1:07:33.833 --> 1:07:35.583
and the-the family, the whole thing.

1:07:35.666 --> 1:07:37.375
Yeah. Yeah.

1:07:37.458 --> 1:07:39.166
That'd be nice.

1:07:39.250 --> 1:07:40.458
Yeah.

1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:44.583
(both chuckle softly)

1:07:44.666 --> 1:07:46.416
(both laughing)

1:07:46.500 --> 1:07:49.625
-I can't believe this is happening, right?
-Me, too.

1:07:49.708 --> 1:07:52.166
-I mean, what…
-Oh, my God. (sniffs)

1:07:52.250 --> 1:07:54.416
Wait, I'm sorry, what's happening?

1:07:54.500 --> 1:07:55.791
I'm gonna propose.

1:07:55.875 --> 1:07:57.208
What?

1:07:57.291 --> 1:07:59.708
-Yeah. I mean, sure, it's fast, but…
-It's very fast!

1:07:59.791 --> 1:08:01.291
I pretty much already
live with Ginny anyways.

1:08:01.375 --> 1:08:02.958
I had roommates in college.
I didn't marry those dudes.

1:08:03.041 --> 1:08:04.125
(chuckles) You know what I mean?

1:08:04.208 --> 1:08:05.750
I can't picture my life without her.

1:08:05.833 --> 1:08:07.041
Ah, no.

1:08:07.125 --> 1:08:09.500
Loo-- Hey, you know, look, man,
you did a lot of drugs tonight, right?

1:08:09.583 --> 1:08:10.875
So maybe you're not thinking too clearly.

1:08:10.958 --> 1:08:12.041
No, no.

1:08:12.125 --> 1:08:14.541
Peter, look at me.

1:08:16.458 --> 1:08:18.166
-Oh, there's my ride.
-Uh, oh, no.

1:08:18.250 --> 1:08:19.500
-Uh, Noah, no.
-Yes.

1:08:19.583 --> 1:08:20.791
-Come here, come here, come here.
-All right, no, wa-wait.

1:08:20.875 --> 1:08:22.208
Let's cancel this one
and talk some more because…

1:08:22.291 --> 1:08:23.916
Hey. You did this.

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.250
-You.
-No. No.

1:08:26.333 --> 1:08:28.750
(chuckles) Let's not go
spreading that around town.

1:08:28.833 --> 1:08:30.750
-'Cause I didn't do it.
-Yes! I'm getting married!

1:08:30.833 --> 1:08:31.833
Ah.

1:08:31.916 --> 1:08:33.791
-You know, you're talking crazy.
-(car door closes)

1:08:33.875 --> 1:08:36.750
Ah, shit, man. Ah, shit.

1:08:36.833 --> 1:08:38.708
Shit.

1:08:38.791 --> 1:08:40.875
Oh, God.

1:08:40.958 --> 1:08:43.333
(sighs)

1:08:45.791 --> 1:08:47.791
(line ringing)

1:08:49.416 --> 1:08:52.000
ANNE (recorded):
Hey. You've reached Anne.

1:08:52.083 --> 1:08:55.750
Leave me a message or anything you think
might make me feel inspired.

1:08:55.833 --> 1:08:57.416
(beep)

1:08:58.416 --> 1:09:00.291
Hey. It's, uh, it's me.

1:09:00.375 --> 1:09:01.708
Um…

1:09:02.916 --> 1:09:06.333
I jumped off of a roof
into a hot tub tonight.

1:09:06.416 --> 1:09:08.375
And, uh…

1:09:08.458 --> 1:09:10.833
I-I wanted to tell you
'cause I know you don't think I ever do

1:09:10.916 --> 1:09:14.625
anything spontaneous,
and (chuckles) it was pretty spontaneous.

1:09:17.333 --> 1:09:19.541
Well, actually,
I wanted to tell you because…

1:09:21.333 --> 1:09:24.541
…you're the person I've been telling
things to for the last six years, and I…

1:09:26.416 --> 1:09:27.791
…I just miss it, you know?

1:09:27.875 --> 1:09:29.875
I-I miss it so much my body hurts, Anne.

1:09:33.208 --> 1:09:35.000
And, uh, anyway…

1:09:36.625 --> 1:09:39.416
…I just-- I hope you're doing good.

1:09:39.500 --> 1:09:41.583
And, uh, yeah, that's it. Bye.

1:09:48.625 --> 1:09:50.166
(sputtering sigh)

1:09:52.666 --> 1:09:54.166
What?

1:09:54.250 --> 1:09:55.541
I don't want you to have
a threesome with Anne.

1:09:55.625 --> 1:09:56.916
Yeah, I don't either.

1:09:57.000 --> 1:09:59.125
I don't want to have a threesome
with anyone ever.

1:09:59.208 --> 1:10:00.708
Oh, really?

1:10:00.791 --> 1:10:02.291
You seem like you'd be into them,
like, you know,

1:10:02.375 --> 1:10:04.250
-every once in a while or something.
-No, I-I really

1:10:04.333 --> 1:10:06.875
just like a straightforward
sexual experience, actually.

1:10:06.958 --> 1:10:08.083
I'm with you, you know?

1:10:08.166 --> 1:10:10.500
Like, I guess I-I got
my four positions I can do.

1:10:10.583 --> 1:10:11.791
They-they work for me,

1:10:11.875 --> 1:10:14.791
but I'm not in the bedroom
trying to reinvent the wheel.

1:10:14.875 --> 1:10:16.291
Yeah. So you got your four.

1:10:16.375 --> 1:10:18.500
-You got you on top, her on top…
-Mm-hmm.

1:10:18.583 --> 1:10:20.750
-…doggy style-- excuse me…
-Mm-hmm.

1:10:20.833 --> 1:10:23.333
…and what's the fourth?

1:10:23.416 --> 1:10:24.875
There is no fourth.

1:10:24.958 --> 1:10:26.250
-(laughs)
-I don't know why I said it.

1:10:26.333 --> 1:10:29.333
Listen, this threesome
is not actually gonna happen.

1:10:29.416 --> 1:10:30.458
You don't have to worry.

1:10:30.541 --> 1:10:32.583
We're maybe gonna kiss a little bit.

1:10:32.666 --> 1:10:35.708
Logan can second-base me
if absolutely necessary,

1:10:35.791 --> 1:10:37.791
and I think that will be enough
to freak Anne out.

1:10:37.875 --> 1:10:41.041
Well, definitely she'll freak--
uh, she's-she's very territorial.

1:10:41.125 --> 1:10:43.333
Uh, you know, one time,
she flipped out on my cousin Sally

1:10:43.416 --> 1:10:44.708
just for rubbing my butt at a wedding.

1:10:44.791 --> 1:10:47.416
Uh, that's a problematic anecdote,
I got to tell you.

1:10:47.500 --> 1:10:50.416
Yeah, I shouldn't tell
that story anymore, should I?

1:10:50.500 --> 1:10:51.916
Um…

1:10:53.125 --> 1:10:54.333
How'd it go with Noah?

1:10:54.416 --> 1:10:56.291
(smacks lips) Right.

1:10:56.375 --> 1:10:58.625
Okay. Uh, yeah.

1:10:59.875 --> 1:11:02.333
Well, he definitely misses

1:11:02.416 --> 1:11:04.125
-going out and having fun.
-Yeah. Right.

1:11:04.208 --> 1:11:06.375
-'Cause she's, like, a snooze.
-Yeah.

1:11:06.458 --> 1:11:09.166
But… (sighs)

1:11:09.250 --> 1:11:11.958
he's also pretty serious about Ginny.

1:11:12.041 --> 1:11:13.583
(laughs):
Well, yeah, no shit.

1:11:13.666 --> 1:11:17.583
That's why I'm asking you to sort of
get in there and turn his eye…

1:11:17.666 --> 1:11:19.750
-Yeah.
-…in a different direction.

1:11:19.833 --> 1:11:22.083
I'll think of something. I promise.

1:11:22.166 --> 1:11:23.875
Use this thing.

1:11:23.958 --> 1:11:26.125
-I will. Sorry, yeah. It's just…
-Be brave.

1:11:26.208 --> 1:11:27.500
…he said something that threw me, but--

1:11:27.583 --> 1:11:30.166
Oh, Emma, uh, hang on one second.

1:11:30.250 --> 1:11:31.583
I hope, I hope this is okay.

1:11:31.666 --> 1:11:33.166
I got you something.

1:11:34.375 --> 1:11:36.375
What Color Is Your Parachute?

1:11:36.458 --> 1:11:37.833
-What is this?
-(both laugh)

1:11:37.916 --> 1:11:40.291
I know it looks kind of lame, but, um--

1:11:40.375 --> 1:11:43.000
And I generally feel the same way
about, like, self-help crap.

1:11:43.083 --> 1:11:44.583
-Well, books are for dorks.
-But, um, people really love this one.

1:11:44.666 --> 1:11:46.750
It's supposed to help you
find your purpose.

1:11:46.833 --> 1:11:50.375
Uh, uh, your purpose… work-wise.

1:11:50.458 --> 1:11:53.666
Because I know how unhappy you are
at your job, and-- I don't know--

1:11:53.750 --> 1:11:57.125
I figured it could be useful
if you decide to choose a new path.

1:11:57.208 --> 1:11:59.708
Yeah, I don't need your help
figuring my life out, Peter.

1:11:59.791 --> 1:12:01.291
-No. (chuckles) -I'm not a problem
that needs to be solved.

1:12:01.375 --> 1:12:03.750
Yeah. No, of course not.
I didn't mean for it like that.

1:12:03.833 --> 1:12:05.333
I just…

1:12:05.416 --> 1:12:08.333
Look, the other day, you were just really
supportive of me following my dream,

1:12:08.416 --> 1:12:10.250
and…

1:12:10.333 --> 1:12:11.958
uh, that made me feel really good.

1:12:12.041 --> 1:12:15.041
You know, it made me feel good
that you believe in me.

1:12:15.125 --> 1:12:19.208
I just wanted you to know
that I believe in you, too.

1:12:22.833 --> 1:12:23.833
Thanks.

1:12:24.916 --> 1:12:26.875
-Yeah. Well, you're welcome.
-(laughs)

1:12:26.958 --> 1:12:28.000
Yeah.

1:12:28.083 --> 1:12:30.458
-(elevator bell dings)
-So, um,

1:12:30.541 --> 1:12:33.500
what kind of sex stuff is Anne into,
for when I have sex

1:12:33.583 --> 1:12:35.833
-with her this weekend?
-Stop. Stop it. Stop.

1:12:35.916 --> 1:12:38.083
-(screams) Help! Please!
-(piano playing dramatic music)

1:12:38.166 --> 1:12:40.958
Relax, sweetheart, and it'll be easier.

1:12:41.041 --> 1:12:42.250
No! Audrey!

1:12:42.333 --> 1:12:44.458
Get off her! (grunts) Get…

1:12:44.541 --> 1:12:46.500
-(boy grunts)
-Get off! Get off!

1:12:46.583 --> 1:12:48.583
-(grunts)
-(panting weakly)

1:12:50.583 --> 1:12:53.125
Audrey, are you all right?

1:12:53.208 --> 1:12:54.583
(coughs)

1:12:54.666 --> 1:12:55.750
Yes.

1:12:55.833 --> 1:12:57.458
(coughing)

1:12:58.833 --> 1:13:00.916
-No. (sobs)
-(girls gasping)

1:13:01.000 --> 1:13:02.125
Audrey!

1:13:02.208 --> 1:13:04.375
-(whispers): I was way better.
-(kids sobbing)

1:13:04.458 --> 1:13:05.875
(sobbing):
I need you, please.

1:13:05.958 --> 1:13:07.708
Don't die.

1:13:07.791 --> 1:13:15.166
No…!

1:13:15.250 --> 1:13:16.416
(sobbing):
No.

1:13:16.500 --> 1:13:17.750
(mutters)

1:13:17.833 --> 1:13:20.541
(cheering, applause)

1:13:26.791 --> 1:13:29.208
Oh, my God, are you the kid
that moved the plant around?

1:13:30.625 --> 1:13:34.000
Yeah. I'm a real genius at
pushing a killer plant around a stage.

1:13:34.083 --> 1:13:35.166
It was graceful.

1:13:35.250 --> 1:13:36.916
It was beautiful.

1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.583
So, it's been real.

1:13:39.666 --> 1:13:40.708
Whoa.

1:13:40.791 --> 1:13:42.458
Wha-- Am I dying?

1:13:42.541 --> 1:13:45.625
-What are you talking about?
-Well, the play is over, so…

1:13:45.708 --> 1:13:47.666
So we're gonna have to find
another way to keep in touch.

1:13:47.750 --> 1:13:49.000
Seriously?

1:13:49.083 --> 1:13:51.250
(laughs):
Yeah. Give me your phone.

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.666
Okay. Thank you.

1:13:54.750 --> 1:13:59.000
And just to be clear,
this is strictly platonic.

1:13:59.083 --> 1:14:00.208
Okay?

1:14:02.041 --> 1:14:03.916
I don't know what "platonic" means,

1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:05.666
but you're my girlfriend now.

1:14:06.750 --> 1:14:08.625
Your funeral, man.

1:14:08.708 --> 1:14:11.250
That was fantastic.

1:14:11.333 --> 1:14:13.500
You just-- you had so much--
I-I-- You just…

1:14:13.583 --> 1:14:16.083
Hey. Um, so, so great, guys.

1:14:16.166 --> 1:14:17.333
-Hey.
-Congrats!

1:14:17.416 --> 1:14:19.708
-Um, thank you.
-(laughs): That was so beautiful.

1:14:19.791 --> 1:14:21.833
-Weren't they so good? Oh, my gosh.
-They killed it.

1:14:21.916 --> 1:14:24.291
They were so great,
and they were covered in blood.

1:14:24.375 --> 1:14:25.666
-The children.
-Uh, okay.

1:14:25.750 --> 1:14:27.708
Well, uh, are you ready
to get out of here?

1:14:27.791 --> 1:14:29.500
Oh.

1:14:29.583 --> 1:14:31.666
-Oh, yeah. Big-time.
-Okay. All right.

1:14:31.750 --> 1:14:32.833
(chuckles)

1:14:32.916 --> 1:14:34.291
O-Only if-if you still want to.

1:14:34.375 --> 1:14:36.500
Obviously, I want to.

1:14:36.583 --> 1:14:38.625
Like I said, I've had a lot of threesomes.

1:14:38.708 --> 1:14:40.208
-Cool.
-Yeah.

1:14:40.291 --> 1:14:42.000
-Um…
-And obviously…

1:14:42.083 --> 1:14:43.083
Anne. Yeah.

1:14:45.833 --> 1:14:47.916
Yeah. Let's do this.

1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:49.791
Yeah. Yeah.

1:14:49.875 --> 1:14:52.666
Just give me one second.
I'm just leaving the house.

1:14:52.750 --> 1:14:55.208
-Okay. Yeah, I hear you.
-PETER (whispers): Okay.

1:14:55.291 --> 1:14:58.416
Okay, Emma, this is what you want, huh?

1:14:58.500 --> 1:15:02.666
You're fucking my girlfriend,
I'm framing your boyfriend,

1:15:02.750 --> 1:15:04.958
'cause that's what friends are for.

1:15:05.041 --> 1:15:06.916
All right. What am I gonna do?

1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.208
Put the condom in the bed or…?

1:15:10.291 --> 1:15:12.500
Maybe just the wrapper.

1:15:12.583 --> 1:15:14.000
Yeah, just the wrapper.

1:15:14.083 --> 1:15:15.416
Oh, shit.

1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:19.416
(sighs) No, I'm not donating food
to Justin Bieber's church.

1:15:19.500 --> 1:15:21.000
Oh, he's gonna post about it?

1:15:21.083 --> 1:15:22.916
Okay, fine.

1:15:30.875 --> 1:15:32.000
(record crackles)

1:15:32.083 --> 1:15:34.375
-Okay. All right.
-(jazz music playing)

1:15:34.458 --> 1:15:36.958
-Okay. Okay.
-What, what? (laughs)

1:15:37.041 --> 1:15:38.166
Here we go.

1:15:38.250 --> 1:15:40.833
(whispers):
I'll be right back.

1:15:40.916 --> 1:15:42.166
(jazz song continues in French)

1:15:42.250 --> 1:15:43.791
Mm.

1:15:47.791 --> 1:15:51.125
Okay, you know you don't
have to do this if you don't want to.

1:15:51.208 --> 1:15:52.333
Really don't.

1:15:52.416 --> 1:15:54.375
-What?
-I'm…

1:15:54.458 --> 1:15:56.583
I'm just saying, you don't have
anything to prove to Logan.

1:15:56.666 --> 1:15:58.416
-(softly): Oh.
-Or me or…

1:15:58.500 --> 1:15:59.875
-No, I know that. No, no.
-You could just…

1:15:59.958 --> 1:16:01.500
This is for me. I'm doing this for me.

1:16:01.583 --> 1:16:04.416
I'm-I'm… I am a sexually
adventurous person.

1:16:04.500 --> 1:16:06.041
-Hi, baby.
-Hey. -Okay.

1:16:06.125 --> 1:16:08.416
Okay. Here we are.

1:16:08.500 --> 1:16:09.708
Okay.

1:16:09.791 --> 1:16:14.666
Well, I was saving this
for another special occasion.

1:16:14.750 --> 1:16:16.708
I think this will pair well
with the mélange of…

1:16:16.791 --> 1:16:17.916
Let's stop wasting time.

1:16:18.000 --> 1:16:19.458
(Anne moaning)

1:16:19.541 --> 1:16:20.750
Mm.

1:16:21.833 --> 1:16:23.083
Oh.

1:16:23.166 --> 1:16:24.791
Anne's a real tigress, huh?

1:16:24.875 --> 1:16:26.708
-Mm.
-(chuckles)

1:16:26.791 --> 1:16:28.583
I'm also here.

1:16:28.666 --> 1:16:30.250
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:33.000
Oh.

1:16:34.083 --> 1:16:35.458
(grunts) Oh, okay.

1:16:35.541 --> 1:16:36.875
I'm gonna try the wine.

1:16:38.375 --> 1:16:39.583
(alarm chimes)

1:16:40.750 --> 1:16:42.291
Okay.

1:16:48.500 --> 1:16:50.541
This is a very nice house.

1:16:56.416 --> 1:16:59.125
(sighing)

1:17:01.708 --> 1:17:03.166
No, this isn't right. I can't do this.

1:17:03.250 --> 1:17:05.541
-(alarm chimes)
-Oh, shit.

1:17:10.583 --> 1:17:12.291
The fuck is that?

1:17:16.833 --> 1:17:18.041
(grunts)

1:17:18.125 --> 1:17:19.541
(panting)

1:17:19.625 --> 1:17:21.625
(footsteps ascending stairs)

1:17:27.916 --> 1:17:29.583
(sighs, grunts)

1:17:38.000 --> 1:17:39.250
Okay.

1:17:40.333 --> 1:17:41.541
Okay.

1:17:41.625 --> 1:17:43.666
You can do this.

1:17:43.750 --> 1:17:46.083
-Ginny, I fucking love you.
-(pants unzip, urinating)

1:17:46.166 --> 1:17:47.833
No. (sighs)

1:17:47.916 --> 1:17:49.416
Ginny, I fucking love you. Come on.

1:17:49.500 --> 1:17:52.000
-Keep it clean.
-(toilet flushing)

1:17:52.083 --> 1:17:54.625
You plus me equals forever.

1:17:55.875 --> 1:17:57.333
(sighs)

1:17:57.416 --> 1:18:00.708
You're my fire, my one desire.

1:18:00.791 --> 1:18:02.166
No quotes. (groans)

1:18:02.250 --> 1:18:04.750
I should've worn nicer shoes.

1:18:05.833 --> 1:18:10.291
Um, Anne, Anne, Anne, um, don't you think
our friend is feeling a little…

1:18:10.375 --> 1:18:12.000
left out?

1:18:12.083 --> 1:18:13.291
-Yeah.
-Wow.

1:18:13.375 --> 1:18:15.750
-Oh, ladies first!
-Oh!

1:18:15.833 --> 1:18:17.375
(Emma and Anne moaning)

1:18:18.666 --> 1:18:19.833
-Oh.
-Okay.

1:18:19.916 --> 1:18:22.291
-(chuckles)
-(moaning)

1:18:22.375 --> 1:18:23.750
Okay, this is really--

1:18:23.833 --> 1:18:27.416
I love it, but I-I just wish
we were taking our clothes off.

1:18:27.500 --> 1:18:28.916
-You know?
-Yes.

1:18:29.000 --> 1:18:30.916
-Yeah, let's take off our clothes.
-Great idea. -Oh…

1:18:31.000 --> 1:18:32.458
-Great. May I?
-Okay.

1:18:32.541 --> 1:18:34.958
-Oh, please.
-(whoops, chuckles)

1:18:35.041 --> 1:18:36.500
-Thank you so much.
-I love your smooth body.

1:18:36.583 --> 1:18:37.583
Oh, thank you.

1:18:37.666 --> 1:18:39.000
You're like a dermatologist's dream.

1:18:39.083 --> 1:18:40.083
-(chuckles) Thank you.
-(chuckles)

1:18:40.166 --> 1:18:41.625
-What about my dress?
-Oh, yes.

1:18:41.708 --> 1:18:44.166
-Let me, uh… -But I'm still
wearing all my clothes, so…

1:18:44.250 --> 1:18:46.750
Oh, you know what?
Lucky for you two, I am ambidextrous.

1:18:46.833 --> 1:18:48.333
-Oh.
-Okay.

1:18:48.416 --> 1:18:50.458
Oh, there you go.
And, uh… (inhales sharply)

1:18:50.541 --> 1:18:51.583
Need to feel it out.

1:18:51.666 --> 1:18:53.666
Uh, okay, maybe just one at a time.

1:18:53.750 --> 1:18:55.125
-Yeah.
-There we go. Okay.

1:18:55.208 --> 1:18:56.583
Okay, you working on that.

1:18:56.666 --> 1:18:59.250
I can't wait to see what else
these fingies can do, right?

1:18:59.333 --> 1:19:00.375
-And there we go.
-Ah.

1:19:00.458 --> 1:19:01.916
There it is. (laughs)

1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:03.250
You did it.

1:19:03.333 --> 1:19:04.708
(sighs, chuckles)

1:19:04.791 --> 1:19:06.708
Okay, well, this is heating up, I think.

1:19:06.791 --> 1:19:09.916
Um, shall we move this ménage
to-to the bed?

1:19:11.875 --> 1:19:13.083
Or we could dance for you.

1:19:13.166 --> 1:19:15.000
Yes. Yes.

1:19:15.083 --> 1:19:16.250
-Let's dance for you!
-Oh, okay.

1:19:16.333 --> 1:19:17.750
Alexa, play anything!

1:19:17.833 --> 1:19:20.083
(sighs heavily)

1:19:20.166 --> 1:19:22.916
(front door opens, closes)

1:19:26.375 --> 1:19:28.375
(footsteps ascending stairs)

1:19:28.458 --> 1:19:29.583
(sighs)

1:19:30.708 --> 1:19:33.125
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

1:19:33.208 --> 1:19:34.541
Hi.

1:19:34.625 --> 1:19:35.750
(both chuckle)

1:19:35.833 --> 1:19:37.583
It's like a fire hazard in here.

1:19:37.666 --> 1:19:39.500
-What's going on?
-(chuckles)

1:19:40.625 --> 1:19:42.833
Well, what's happening is…

1:19:42.916 --> 1:19:44.125
Whoa, whoa.

1:19:44.208 --> 1:19:46.000
…I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

1:19:46.083 --> 1:19:48.250
Will you marry me?

1:19:50.666 --> 1:19:52.666
It's… it's really fast.

1:19:52.750 --> 1:19:53.791
I know.

1:19:53.875 --> 1:19:57.500
But I-I feel like we've been together
long enough for me to know

1:19:57.583 --> 1:19:59.458
all the important stuff.

1:19:59.541 --> 1:20:02.958
Like I want to fall asleep
next to you every night,

1:20:03.041 --> 1:20:04.833
and I want to wake up
next to you every morning.

1:20:05.916 --> 1:20:10.041
And, uh, I want to be
the first person to try

1:20:10.125 --> 1:20:12.833
all your new pie flavors

1:20:12.916 --> 1:20:15.875
just so I can see the look
on your face when I tell you

1:20:15.958 --> 1:20:17.375
how amazing they are.

1:20:18.458 --> 1:20:19.750
Uh… (sighs)

1:20:20.833 --> 1:20:22.416
I'm screwing this up. I-I-I…

1:20:22.500 --> 1:20:23.875
(both chuckle)

1:20:23.958 --> 1:20:26.375
I love you so much.

1:20:26.458 --> 1:20:28.916
And I, uh…

1:20:29.000 --> 1:20:31.958
I-I just never been more sure
about anything in my entire life.

1:20:41.375 --> 1:20:42.875
So?

1:20:44.833 --> 1:20:45.833
(chuckles nervously)

1:20:48.125 --> 1:20:49.416
Yes, of course.

1:20:49.500 --> 1:20:53.041
-(whispers): Yes?
-Yes, I will marry you.

1:20:53.125 --> 1:20:55.666
(both laugh)

1:20:55.750 --> 1:20:59.000
I know. I just, uh… Ah.

1:20:59.083 --> 1:21:00.333
-Supposed to put this on.
-Oh, my God.

1:21:00.416 --> 1:21:01.708
Oh, shit.

1:21:02.708 --> 1:21:04.375
(gasps)

1:21:04.458 --> 1:21:05.583
Oh, my God.

1:21:07.041 --> 1:21:08.375
-Mm.
-I love you so much.

1:21:08.458 --> 1:21:10.166
I love you, too.

1:21:10.250 --> 1:21:11.791
-Yeah.
-We're getting married.

1:21:11.875 --> 1:21:13.916
-(laughs, pained grunt)
-(laughs)

1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:15.625
Yes.

1:21:15.708 --> 1:21:17.208
Mm, yeah.

1:21:17.291 --> 1:21:19.625
(both grunt, chuckle)

1:21:21.291 --> 1:21:22.708
Stupid pants.

1:21:22.791 --> 1:21:24.208
(Ginny laughs)

1:21:27.166 --> 1:21:29.125
There. (chuckles)

1:21:29.208 --> 1:21:31.208
(R&B music playing)

1:21:35.791 --> 1:21:36.833
-(sighs)
-(music ends)

1:21:36.916 --> 1:21:38.583
Oh, I-I think that is-- that's the end.

1:21:38.666 --> 1:21:40.375
One more song?

1:21:40.458 --> 1:21:42.416
-One more song. -(sighs)
-Uh, really?

1:21:42.500 --> 1:21:44.500
Uh, it-it feels like you've been
dancing for-for a while now.

1:21:44.583 --> 1:21:46.833
(sighs):
Okay. All right.

1:21:46.916 --> 1:21:48.416
-Anne.
-Hmm?

1:21:48.500 --> 1:21:49.500
I think it's time.

1:21:49.583 --> 1:21:51.166
It's time, yes.

1:21:52.083 --> 1:21:55.041
-I think it's time for us to all
have sex together. -Yeah?

1:21:56.291 --> 1:21:57.708
-Sure. Yeah.
-Come on. Yeah.

1:21:57.791 --> 1:21:59.791
Okay, let's do it.

1:21:59.875 --> 1:22:01.291
May I, uh, take off your pants?

1:22:01.375 --> 1:22:03.500
-Oh, yes. Yeah, ple-- yeah, of course.
-Yeah. Okay.

1:22:03.583 --> 1:22:06.000
-Get-get these--
It's just these buttons. -Oh. Oh.

1:22:06.083 --> 1:22:08.541
-Just lift your butt, I think.
-Okay, yeah.

1:22:08.625 --> 1:22:10.458
-Okay.
-Um, maybe-- Wow.

1:22:10.541 --> 1:22:12.083
Snug little… little guys, these…

1:22:12.166 --> 1:22:13.916
-Maybe one at a time.
-Yeah, one at a time.

1:22:14.000 --> 1:22:15.125
-Okay.
-Oh, yay.

1:22:15.208 --> 1:22:16.416
-(laughing): Wow.
-(sighs)

1:22:16.500 --> 1:22:19.708
-That was really difficult.
-(chuckles) It was.

1:22:19.791 --> 1:22:20.833
Anne, come on.

1:22:20.916 --> 1:22:22.416
-Yeah, Anne.
-Join us.

1:22:22.500 --> 1:22:23.958
(panting)

1:22:24.041 --> 1:22:25.708
Yeah, j… just a sec.

1:22:25.791 --> 1:22:29.250
I-- you know, I'm just, um,
I'm just trying to figure out this, uh--

1:22:29.333 --> 1:22:30.750
Ooh. (chuckles)

1:22:30.833 --> 1:22:32.125
Here, get this dim right.

1:22:32.208 --> 1:22:34.416
How's that? You like that?

1:22:34.500 --> 1:22:35.750
Uh, Anne, what's-what's going on?

1:22:35.833 --> 1:22:38.291
-What do you mean?
-I mean, do-do you not want to do this?

1:22:38.375 --> 1:22:40.625
I thought this was something
that you wanted to explore.

1:22:40.708 --> 1:22:43.833
-It is.
-Okay, well, then let yourself be free.

1:22:43.916 --> 1:22:44.958
-Right?
-Yeah.

1:22:45.041 --> 1:22:48.000
I mean, you're not with your boring
old boyfriend anymore, right?

1:22:48.083 --> 1:22:49.291
I never said he was boring.

1:22:49.375 --> 1:22:53.041
No, no, but you mentioned that he's, like,
the human equivalent of toast.

1:22:53.125 --> 1:22:54.791
Yeah, but I love toast.
I mean, who doesn't love toast?

1:22:54.875 --> 1:22:55.875
Everyone loves toast.

1:22:55.958 --> 1:22:58.750
It goes with everything and
it makes you feel all good inside, and…

1:22:58.833 --> 1:23:01.458
Peter is not that boring.

1:23:01.541 --> 1:23:03.000
He's not the worst at all.

1:23:03.083 --> 1:23:06.791
He's… he's really kind,
and he's-he's really sweet,

1:23:06.875 --> 1:23:09.333
and he's funny, and he has my back,
and he cares about me,

1:23:09.416 --> 1:23:12.000
and he would never make me have
a threesome with this horrible woman.

1:23:12.875 --> 1:23:16.125
-I am so sorry.
-Oh, no, I'm not… being great.

1:23:16.208 --> 1:23:17.583
Logan, you're right.

1:23:17.666 --> 1:23:19.625
I don't want to do this.

1:23:19.708 --> 1:23:22.333
And, uh, I don't want to do anything
with you ever again.

1:23:22.416 --> 1:23:25.125
Um, see you at school.

1:23:26.500 --> 1:23:28.041
(sighs)

1:23:30.791 --> 1:23:32.458
(sighs)

1:23:32.541 --> 1:23:34.666
Okay, well, and then…

1:23:34.750 --> 1:23:36.791
there were two.

1:23:40.041 --> 1:23:41.625
-(sighs) Wow.
-(chuckles)

1:23:41.708 --> 1:23:44.250
(both sighing)

1:23:44.333 --> 1:23:46.500
Three times?

1:23:46.583 --> 1:23:48.208
-Oh, thanks, babe.
-Here.

1:23:48.291 --> 1:23:49.708
Yeah.

1:23:49.791 --> 1:23:51.791
-(sighs)
-Oh, I'm dying.

1:23:51.875 --> 1:23:53.791
I can't even move.

1:23:53.875 --> 1:23:56.083
-I need a shower.
-Me, too.

1:23:58.166 --> 1:23:59.625
(sighs) And then pie.

1:23:59.708 --> 1:24:00.958
Wait for me.

1:24:01.041 --> 1:24:02.750
-Okay.
-(sighs)

1:24:02.833 --> 1:24:04.833
-(shower running)
-(Ginny and Noah moaning)

1:24:11.000 --> 1:24:12.208
(Ginny laughs)

1:24:12.291 --> 1:24:14.291
(moaning continues)

1:24:28.375 --> 1:24:30.000
Hi.

1:24:30.083 --> 1:24:31.166
Hey.

1:24:31.250 --> 1:24:32.625
(both chuckle)

1:24:32.708 --> 1:24:34.125
Um, 'kay.

1:24:34.208 --> 1:24:35.375
(sighs) Yeah.

1:24:35.458 --> 1:24:37.375
-I had a really weird night.
-Yeah. (laughs)

1:24:37.458 --> 1:24:40.666
-Something in the air.
-Uh, maybe the weirdest night ever.

1:24:40.750 --> 1:24:41.833
Hold on one sec. Hold on one sec.

1:24:41.916 --> 1:24:43.291
-Uh, actually, you, um…
-I am so hungry.

1:24:43.375 --> 1:24:44.958
Listen. Wait, Emma. Sorry.

1:24:45.041 --> 1:24:48.458
Um, before we get into anything, uh…

1:24:48.541 --> 1:24:51.916
I got something I got to tell you,
and it's-it's really kind of bad,

1:24:52.000 --> 1:24:54.500
so let me just kind of say it quickly
before I lose my nerve.

1:24:54.583 --> 1:24:56.166
Okay.

1:24:57.250 --> 1:25:00.000
Noah asked Ginny to marry him.

1:25:01.625 --> 1:25:04.208
And, um, she said yes.

1:25:05.666 --> 1:25:06.791
I'm sorry.

1:25:06.875 --> 1:25:10.625
I mean, I-I know you think
that Noah's the love of your life,

1:25:10.708 --> 1:25:13.625
and I understand that, but maybe
he's not the love of your life, right?

1:25:13.708 --> 1:25:16.666
Maybe if he's marrying Ginny,
that's meant to be,

1:25:16.750 --> 1:25:19.291
and there's something for you
out there that's-that's better,

1:25:19.375 --> 1:25:21.708
-that's meant to be, and you j…
-Yes.

1:25:21.791 --> 1:25:23.250
No, you're right.

1:25:23.333 --> 1:25:24.458
I am?

1:25:24.541 --> 1:25:26.833
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1:25:26.916 --> 1:25:29.041
Okay. Uh, I thought you'd be more upset.

1:25:29.125 --> 1:25:31.750
Yeah, I'm…

1:25:31.833 --> 1:25:35.041
-Me, too.
-All right, well, good.

1:25:35.125 --> 1:25:36.500
Then I'm off the hook, I guess. (laughs)

1:25:36.583 --> 1:25:37.708
-(chuckles softly)
-Great.

1:25:37.791 --> 1:25:40.375
Uh, I was feeling so guilty about it.

1:25:40.458 --> 1:25:41.750
I'm sorry, eat. Yeah, get something.

1:25:41.833 --> 1:25:43.083
-Yeah.
-Oh, and tell me about your night.

1:25:43.166 --> 1:25:45.083
-I-I'm dying to know. (chuckles)
-Oh. Okay.

1:25:45.166 --> 1:25:46.458
-(phone vibrating)
-Um…

1:25:46.541 --> 1:25:48.625
-So…
-Sorry, uh…

1:25:48.708 --> 1:25:50.166
Oh, my God, Anne's calling me.

1:25:50.250 --> 1:25:52.125
-Uh, did you have sex with her?
What, uh… -Okay, well…

1:25:52.208 --> 1:25:53.916
-Right.
-Sorry, I'll just…

1:25:54.000 --> 1:25:55.333
Hello?

1:25:55.416 --> 1:25:56.875
Mm-hmm.

1:25:58.333 --> 1:25:59.708
Oh, yeah?

1:25:59.791 --> 1:26:01.291
Okay.

1:26:01.375 --> 1:26:05.375
I-I'm not there, so I'd-I'd need,
like, uh, 15 minutes or so,

1:26:05.458 --> 1:26:06.625
but, um, that sounds good.

1:26:06.708 --> 1:26:08.625
I'll-I'll see you soon. Yeah.

1:26:08.708 --> 1:26:09.916
Okay, bye.

1:26:10.916 --> 1:26:12.125
She wants to come over.

1:26:12.208 --> 1:26:13.875
I think she broke up with Logan.

1:26:13.958 --> 1:26:15.833
-I know.
-Shit.

1:26:15.916 --> 1:26:17.375
Emma, you did it!

1:26:17.458 --> 1:26:20.625
(laughing):
I can't believe you did--

1:26:20.708 --> 1:26:22.333
I'm gonna, I'm gonna go.
I'm gonna go, uh--

1:26:22.416 --> 1:26:23.625
That's okay, right? You don't mind.

1:26:23.708 --> 1:26:26.250
That's-- this is incredible. Wow, uh…

1:26:26.333 --> 1:26:28.083
Well, here, let me, let me
give you some money.

1:26:28.166 --> 1:26:30.125
A twenty, that should cover it, right?

1:26:30.208 --> 1:26:33.000
Um… Emma,

1:26:33.083 --> 1:26:34.166
thank you so much.

1:26:34.250 --> 1:26:36.625
-Really, that's…
-(chuckles)

1:26:36.708 --> 1:26:38.416
You're amazing.

1:26:57.000 --> 1:26:58.791
I still had my key, so I…

1:27:02.208 --> 1:27:03.541
Oh.

1:27:04.833 --> 1:27:06.500
Oh, I missed you so much.

1:27:06.583 --> 1:27:07.833
Oh, my God, I missed you.

1:27:09.958 --> 1:27:11.750
Mm. Mm. Mm.

1:27:11.833 --> 1:27:13.291
Have you been working out?

1:27:13.375 --> 1:27:15.458
Yeah.

1:27:15.541 --> 1:27:17.500
(Anne moans)

1:27:22.916 --> 1:27:24.791
-Hi.
-Hi.

1:27:27.125 --> 1:27:28.500
Is now a good time or, uh…

1:27:28.583 --> 1:27:31.250
Uh, well, do you want,
like, a full brace face

1:27:31.333 --> 1:27:33.416
-or do you just want, like, a retainer?
-(laughs)

1:27:37.458 --> 1:27:38.875
So how'd it go last night?

1:27:39.958 --> 1:27:41.958
(smacks lips) Um…

1:27:43.583 --> 1:27:44.708
Good. You know?

1:27:44.791 --> 1:27:46.291
We're-we're back together.

1:27:47.708 --> 1:27:50.666
-Which is surprising, right? 'Cause I-I…
-Yeah. (chuckles)

1:27:50.750 --> 1:27:52.875
-I mean, I ki-- I kind of
can't believe it worked. -Wow.

1:27:52.958 --> 1:27:54.541
Yeah.

1:27:54.625 --> 1:27:56.416
-That's great.
-Yeah, I mean…

1:27:57.500 --> 1:28:00.333
-(chuckles) -Look, thank you
so much, Emma, for everything.

1:28:00.416 --> 1:28:02.708
It's really amazing.

1:28:02.791 --> 1:28:04.291
No problem.

1:28:05.666 --> 1:28:07.041
It was a pleasure.

1:28:07.125 --> 1:28:10.375
(both chuckling)

1:28:10.458 --> 1:28:15.375
Cool. Well, um, that second run theater
is playing Beetlejuice this weekend.

1:28:15.458 --> 1:28:16.791
If you want to go see that.

1:28:16.875 --> 1:28:21.833
Yeah, um, I'd like to, but, you know,
now that Anne and I are back together…

1:28:21.916 --> 1:28:23.041
Mm.

1:28:23.125 --> 1:28:26.541
…she obviously can't know
that we know each other.

1:28:26.625 --> 1:28:29.541
-Right. -I mean, I don't want
to sneak around behind her back.

1:28:29.625 --> 1:28:31.458
So we really can't…

1:28:32.958 --> 1:28:34.375
…hang out anymore.

1:28:37.041 --> 1:28:38.541
Oh.

1:28:38.625 --> 1:28:40.125
(quietly):
Oh.

1:28:40.208 --> 1:28:42.666
(clicks tongue)

1:28:42.750 --> 1:28:44.791
Can't believe we didn't
think this part all the way through.

1:28:44.875 --> 1:28:47.166
(chuckles):
Yeah.

1:28:47.250 --> 1:28:49.791
Totally. Uh, we did not think about that.

1:28:49.875 --> 1:28:50.916
Yeah.

1:28:51.000 --> 1:28:53.541
Look, we can still talk and stuff, like,
when we see each other around the office.

1:28:53.625 --> 1:28:56.375
Yeah, I think it's probably best
if we don't.

1:28:56.458 --> 1:28:57.583
Yeah.

1:28:59.375 --> 1:29:01.458
I guess you're probably right about that.
Um…

1:29:03.625 --> 1:29:06.500
Look, I'm sorry I wasn't able
to do my half of the…

1:29:06.583 --> 1:29:08.250
Don't. It's-- Thank you.

1:29:08.333 --> 1:29:10.333
Or congratulations.

1:29:13.583 --> 1:29:15.125
(smacks lips) Thank you.

1:29:15.208 --> 1:29:16.708
Um…

1:29:16.791 --> 1:29:18.916
I'll let you get back to work.

1:29:24.375 --> 1:29:27.833
(door opens, closes)

1:29:27.916 --> 1:29:31.041
(phone ringing)

1:29:31.125 --> 1:29:33.208
Uh, McMillan Orthodontics.

1:29:35.416 --> 1:29:37.458
Um… (sniffles)

1:29:37.541 --> 1:29:40.125
let me take a look for you.

1:29:42.208 --> 1:29:44.375
I miss this so much.

1:29:44.458 --> 1:29:46.500
(sighs) No, me, too.

1:29:51.041 --> 1:29:53.666
Hey, remember, um…

1:29:53.750 --> 1:29:56.625
before we took a break, how, uh…

1:29:56.708 --> 1:29:59.583
how you said I was, like, stuck?

1:29:59.666 --> 1:30:01.958
You know, like, I mean, like, in my job.

1:30:03.416 --> 1:30:04.625
Yeah.

1:30:05.750 --> 1:30:09.166
Well, I was thinking about finally…

1:30:09.250 --> 1:30:11.916
betting on myself and going out on my own.

1:30:14.833 --> 1:30:16.625
You mean like…

1:30:16.708 --> 1:30:19.000
trying to start your own retirement home?

1:30:19.083 --> 1:30:20.416
Well, not trying.

1:30:20.500 --> 1:30:22.250
I mean, I-I really think I could do it.

1:30:22.333 --> 1:30:25.791
Uh, look, interest rates
are insanely low right now.

1:30:25.875 --> 1:30:27.291
And there are
these federal grants available

1:30:27.375 --> 1:30:28.958
from the Department of Health
and Human Services…

1:30:29.041 --> 1:30:31.458
Peter, you don't have to do that.

1:30:33.208 --> 1:30:34.416
Huh?

1:30:34.500 --> 1:30:36.708
Yeah. You don't have to
do that for me, baby.

1:30:36.791 --> 1:30:38.333
I was wrong.

1:30:39.958 --> 1:30:44.416
I was. When I said all that stuff
about you playing it safe, I…

1:30:46.083 --> 1:30:48.333
I realized that's just who you are.

1:30:48.416 --> 1:30:50.833
And there's nothing wrong with that.

1:30:50.916 --> 1:30:52.416
(whispers):
I love you.

1:30:53.625 --> 1:30:55.083
(Anne sighs)

1:31:00.458 --> 1:31:03.291
-I love you, too.
-(sighs)

1:31:03.375 --> 1:31:05.291
("Something Old, Something New"
by Lonnie Russ playing)

1:31:09.500 --> 1:31:12.041
-I like those.

1:31:12.125 --> 1:31:13.583
-(both chatting indistinctly)

1:31:33.916 --> 1:31:35.083
(laughs)

1:31:37.333 --> 1:31:39.541
Ha-ha, Topanga. Hubba-hubba.

1:31:39.625 --> 1:31:40.625
(phone chimes)

1:32:12.333 --> 1:32:13.958
Happy anniversary.

1:32:15.958 --> 1:32:17.875
(laughter, indistinct chatter)

1:32:27.541 --> 1:32:29.250
Hey.

1:32:43.541 --> 1:32:45.041
-(song fades)

1:32:45.125 --> 1:32:47.791
Hey. Can I talk to you guys for a sec?

1:32:47.875 --> 1:32:48.916
What's up?

1:32:49.000 --> 1:32:52.083
Well, I just wanted you guys
to know that, um,

1:32:52.166 --> 1:32:54.791
I found my own apartment
and I am moving out.

1:32:54.875 --> 1:32:58.208
And, you know, I think
I did stay here a little bit too long

1:32:58.291 --> 1:33:02.500
and just overdue for some changes,
and it's sort of the end of an era…

1:33:02.583 --> 1:33:03.583
When are you leaving?

1:33:03.666 --> 1:33:05.250
Next month.

1:33:05.333 --> 1:33:06.791
Uh, that's so soon!

1:33:06.875 --> 1:33:08.041
That's so soon.

1:33:08.125 --> 1:33:10.333
What Paul means is, um,

1:33:10.416 --> 1:33:13.041
that we're gonna miss you around here.

1:33:15.666 --> 1:33:17.666
Okay. Thank you.

1:33:18.666 --> 1:33:22.125
Oh, wait. This letter came for you.

1:33:22.208 --> 1:33:23.666
Mm.

1:33:23.750 --> 1:33:25.833
Thank… you.

1:33:31.750 --> 1:33:33.250
(sighs softly)

1:33:51.541 --> 1:33:53.041
Emma?

1:33:53.125 --> 1:33:54.208
Mm.

1:33:54.291 --> 1:33:55.291
Hi.

1:33:56.291 --> 1:33:58.875
-Logan. Okay.
-Hi.

1:33:58.958 --> 1:34:00.125
Wh-Whatcha doing?

1:34:01.208 --> 1:34:04.958
I just really like the salami here,
and I needed to eat a lot of it,

1:34:05.041 --> 1:34:07.750
and I also happen to be
pounding this bottle of

1:34:07.833 --> 1:34:09.666
"Grenachay."

1:34:09.750 --> 1:34:11.166
Grenache.

1:34:12.625 --> 1:34:14.625
Uh, but I-I like
your pronunciation better.

1:34:14.708 --> 1:34:15.833
Thanks.

1:34:15.916 --> 1:34:17.000
(chuckles):
Yeah.

1:34:17.083 --> 1:34:19.458
You mind if I sit with you?

1:34:19.541 --> 1:34:21.416
Sure, yeah. It's your turf. (chuckles)

1:34:21.500 --> 1:34:24.166
You know, the, uh,
the trick to charcuterie

1:34:24.250 --> 1:34:27.333
is to have the right ratio of
sodium chloride to sodium nitrate. Yeah.

1:34:27.416 --> 1:34:28.666
-Here you are.
-Thanks, Tommy.

1:34:28.750 --> 1:34:30.500
-When I lived in Italia…
-Logan.

1:34:30.583 --> 1:34:32.333
-Mm-hmm?
-I just want to eat this.

1:34:32.416 --> 1:34:34.625
Oh. Okay.

1:34:34.708 --> 1:34:36.541
Can you ever just relax?

1:34:38.166 --> 1:34:39.666
Yeah.

1:34:39.750 --> 1:34:40.958
-Yeah, yeah.
-Join me.

1:34:42.625 --> 1:34:43.708
Thanks. Thank you.

1:34:43.791 --> 1:34:44.958
Yeah, sorry. I, um…

1:34:45.041 --> 1:34:46.291
Sorry.

1:34:47.291 --> 1:34:48.416
(inhales deeply)

1:34:50.916 --> 1:34:52.083
Are you okay?

1:34:52.166 --> 1:34:54.208
Yeah.

1:34:54.291 --> 1:34:56.416
Kind of.

1:34:56.500 --> 1:34:58.041
I, um…

1:34:59.250 --> 1:35:03.083
Friend of mine just posted about
his production of Desire Under the Elms

1:35:03.166 --> 1:35:05.875
moving to Broadway,
and I've been spiraling ever since.

1:35:05.958 --> 1:35:08.208
Mm.

1:35:09.291 --> 1:35:13.791
(sighs) You ever feel like
you're getting left behind?

1:35:14.875 --> 1:35:15.875
Yeah, constantly.

1:35:15.958 --> 1:35:17.791
That's one of my main feelings.

1:35:17.875 --> 1:35:18.875
Yeah?

1:35:18.958 --> 1:35:21.708
I just got invited
to my ex-boyfriend's wedding.

1:35:21.791 --> 1:35:24.250
-Oh, no.
-Yeah. Oh, yeah.

1:35:24.333 --> 1:35:26.291
You gonna go?

1:35:26.375 --> 1:35:28.333
(laughs): No, I'm not thinking of going.
I think I'm gonna pass.

1:35:28.416 --> 1:35:29.791
I don't think I should do that to myself.

1:35:29.875 --> 1:35:31.416
No, no, no, no. Sometimes…

1:35:31.500 --> 1:35:36.750
(sighs) Sometimes seeing someone you once
loved embrace new love can be healing.

1:35:36.833 --> 1:35:39.958
I don't know if that is
the most annoying thing I've ever heard

1:35:40.041 --> 1:35:42.125
-or if it makes total sense.
-(laughs)

1:35:42.208 --> 1:35:43.583
Maybe a bit of both.

1:35:43.666 --> 1:35:45.833
But you can't go alone
'cause that would be…

1:35:45.916 --> 1:35:47.125
-Pathetic?
-Yeah.

1:35:47.208 --> 1:35:48.208
-Yeah.
-Crazy.

1:35:48.291 --> 1:35:49.291
Ill-advised.

1:35:49.375 --> 1:35:52.541
Lucky for you,
I make a really great wedding date.

1:35:53.625 --> 1:35:54.750
Come on.

1:35:54.833 --> 1:35:56.000
What do you mean "come on"?

1:35:56.083 --> 1:35:58.000
What do you mean you want to go
to my ex-boyfriend's wedding?

1:35:58.083 --> 1:36:00.208
Yes, I'm serious.
I think we can have a lot of fun together.

1:36:00.291 --> 1:36:02.458
I mean, look, uh, we-we both love wine.

1:36:02.541 --> 1:36:03.916
-Uh-huh.
-Right?

1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:05.750
Um, uh, we both
don't respect our arteries.

1:36:05.833 --> 1:36:07.041
-(laughs)
-Yeah?

1:36:07.125 --> 1:36:09.541
It's in Savannah on a riverboat.

1:36:09.625 --> 1:36:12.166
Good thing I don't get seasick.

1:36:27.958 --> 1:36:29.666
I've never been to a wedding
on a boat before.

1:36:29.750 --> 1:36:31.416
-Have you? Mm.
-No, I haven't.

1:36:31.500 --> 1:36:34.833
Do they get married by, like, a skipper?

1:36:34.916 --> 1:36:36.250
Um…

1:36:36.333 --> 1:36:37.750
(whispers):
Hi.

1:36:39.750 --> 1:36:42.000
Um, would you mind getting us a drink?

1:36:42.083 --> 1:36:43.875
-Yes. Sure.
-Yeah. -Hey.

1:36:43.958 --> 1:36:45.791
-Hi. Okay.
-Come here.

1:36:45.875 --> 1:36:47.791
-I'm so glad you came.
-Me, too.

1:36:47.875 --> 1:36:48.958
(sighs)

1:36:49.041 --> 1:36:51.583
I can't believe
you're getting married in an hour.

1:36:51.666 --> 1:36:53.708
I know. It's kind of bonkers, right?

1:36:55.541 --> 1:36:57.500
I'm really happy for you, Noah.

1:36:57.583 --> 1:36:58.791
Thanks, Emma.

1:36:58.875 --> 1:37:00.250
Hey. The wine is trash.

1:37:00.333 --> 1:37:01.458
-No. (chuckles)
-(chuckles): Yeah.

1:37:01.541 --> 1:37:02.958
-That's funny.
-Hey.

1:37:03.041 --> 1:37:04.583
-That's… This is, um…
-Noah. -Oh.

1:37:04.666 --> 1:37:06.750
-Logan?
-Anne.

1:37:06.833 --> 1:37:09.000
-Emma.
-Peter.

1:37:09.083 --> 1:37:11.291
What are you doing here?

1:37:12.375 --> 1:37:13.625
Noah and I are good friends.

1:37:13.708 --> 1:37:14.791
You two know each other?

1:37:14.875 --> 1:37:16.875
Sort of. Uh, not well, you know, but…

1:37:16.958 --> 1:37:18.250
-Mm.
-Really?

1:37:18.333 --> 1:37:20.166
How?

1:37:20.250 --> 1:37:22.833
-W-We work together, uh,
in the same building, you know. -Oh.

1:37:22.916 --> 1:37:24.666
-Right, that's it. Yeah.
-Oh. -Yeah, yeah.

1:37:24.750 --> 1:37:27.375
You know, many, many floors,
so a lot of people work there.

1:37:27.458 --> 1:37:29.291
-That's crazy.
-Yeah, it is crazy.

1:37:29.375 --> 1:37:30.750
Not that crazy.

1:37:30.833 --> 1:37:32.541
S-Sorry, we haven't--

1:37:32.625 --> 1:37:34.166
But who-who are you?

1:37:34.250 --> 1:37:35.958
I'm Peter. I'm Anne's boyfriend.

1:37:36.041 --> 1:37:38.000
You're Peter?

1:37:38.083 --> 1:37:40.708
-Funny way to say it, I guess.
-So is this a thing now?

1:37:40.791 --> 1:37:42.375
-Oh, no, no, we're just, you know…
-We're on a date.

1:37:42.458 --> 1:37:43.541
Yeah, on a date.

1:37:43.625 --> 1:37:45.583
A weekend-long date. (chuckles)

1:37:45.666 --> 1:37:48.083
Yeah, Anne, what are you, like,
the date length police? (laughs)

1:37:48.166 --> 1:37:50.625
(chuckles) Oh, Anne, you know Emma?

1:37:50.708 --> 1:37:53.041
-Yeah, they definitely know each other.
-Well, be--

1:37:53.125 --> 1:37:55.833
Yeah, because of, um, the school musical
that she helped out with.

1:37:55.916 --> 1:37:58.583
-That was the one time…
-Oh, just, sorry, one time.

1:37:58.666 --> 1:38:00.333
-Just maybe the one or twice times, but…
-Good. Yeah. Just one time, really.

1:38:00.416 --> 1:38:02.791
Gosh, I drained my drink.
Anyone else want another?

1:38:02.875 --> 1:38:04.083
-Yes!
-Yes, please.

1:38:04.166 --> 1:38:05.250
Oh, I'm okay, thanks.

1:38:05.333 --> 1:38:07.083
-Oh, okay.
-Um, I'll help you carry 'em.

1:38:07.166 --> 1:38:09.875
-I'm fine.
-No, I insist. Uh…

1:38:10.958 --> 1:38:12.875
Well, that's great. You all are friends.

1:38:12.958 --> 1:38:14.500
-Mm. Yeah.
-Yeah. -Yeah.

1:38:14.583 --> 1:38:15.875
Hey, look, I'm so sorry.

1:38:15.958 --> 1:38:18.083
-I didn't realize you were gonna be here.
-Yeah.

1:38:18.166 --> 1:38:19.375
Let's just go, okay?

1:38:19.458 --> 1:38:20.791
Well, I'm an important part
of Noah's life,

1:38:20.875 --> 1:38:23.250
so he invited me and I came here
and now this is happening.

1:38:23.333 --> 1:38:25.583
No, of course, yeah. It's good to see you.

1:38:27.041 --> 1:38:28.791
But you're dating Logan? I mean, what's…

1:38:28.875 --> 1:38:31.125
We're not-- It doesn't mat--
That's none of your business.

1:38:31.208 --> 1:38:32.916
Okay.

1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:34.500
Well, why are you here?

1:38:34.583 --> 1:38:37.000
I didn't realize that you guys were
"invite to a wedding" close.

1:38:37.083 --> 1:38:40.125
Well, yeah, we've become pretty tight,
you know? Just…

1:38:40.208 --> 1:38:41.416
(chuckles):
Mm. Wow.

1:38:41.500 --> 1:38:44.458
So you got Anne back
and you became best friends with Noah.

1:38:44.541 --> 1:38:46.333
(sighs) You really made out
like a freaking bandit.

1:38:46.416 --> 1:38:48.333
(sighs) I'm sorry, Emma.

1:38:48.416 --> 1:38:50.000
I-I didn't know it was
gonna turn out like this.

1:38:50.083 --> 1:38:51.250
-You two been helped?
-Uh…

1:38:51.333 --> 1:38:54.916
Oh, yeah. Can you do, um,
four of the Savannah Fizzes, please?

1:38:55.000 --> 1:38:58.000
Just three of those.
I'll have a dirty Ketel martini, please.

1:38:58.083 --> 1:39:00.333
-You got it.
-(Peter sighs)

1:39:00.416 --> 1:39:01.916
So how are you?

1:39:03.125 --> 1:39:04.958
I'm fine, Peter.

1:39:05.041 --> 1:39:07.083
Actually, I got a new apartment.

1:39:07.166 --> 1:39:08.208
-You did?
-Yeah.

1:39:08.291 --> 1:39:10.125
-Ah, that's great.
-I know.

1:39:10.208 --> 1:39:14.041
And, um, I'm applying to a few
continuing education programs.

1:39:14.125 --> 1:39:16.250
I'm gonna finish my degree, and…

1:39:16.333 --> 1:39:18.250
I decided to become a guidance counselor.

1:39:18.333 --> 1:39:20.791
Oh, my God, that's fantastic, Emma.

1:39:20.875 --> 1:39:22.333
Guidance counselor,
that's, like, the perfect thing for you.

1:39:22.416 --> 1:39:23.500
Thank you.

1:39:25.750 --> 1:39:27.125
(sighs)

1:39:27.208 --> 1:39:28.666
Yeah, that's the reason
why they call it Swan Lake.

1:39:28.750 --> 1:39:30.500
-Ah. -Ah.
-(laughter)

1:39:30.583 --> 1:39:31.958
-Swan Lake story?
-Yeah.

1:39:32.041 --> 1:39:33.666
-Yeah.
-Well, anyways, to, um--

1:39:33.750 --> 1:39:36.541
oh, to Noah and Janice.

1:39:36.625 --> 1:39:37.708
-Uh, Ginny.
-Oh.

1:39:37.791 --> 1:39:39.000
-Oh, Ginny.
-Yeah.

1:39:39.083 --> 1:39:40.583
-Uh, yeah, it was close. You were close.
-With an "G."

1:39:40.666 --> 1:39:42.208
-Oh. -Yeah.
-Oh, Peter.

1:39:42.291 --> 1:39:43.833
Ginny's uncle's here,

1:39:43.916 --> 1:39:45.750
-the commercial real estate broker
I was telling you about. -Mm.

1:39:45.833 --> 1:39:47.291
-Ah, that'd be great
if I could talk to him. -Yeah.

1:39:47.375 --> 1:39:49.541
-Thanks, man. -Peter's opening up
his own retirement home.

1:39:49.625 --> 1:39:52.708
Yeah, it's super risky to go out
on your own, but he's doing it.

1:39:52.791 --> 1:39:53.916
Uh, yeah.

1:39:54.000 --> 1:39:55.791
I always knew you could. (chuckles softly)

1:39:55.875 --> 1:39:56.916
Right.

1:39:57.000 --> 1:39:58.583
-Yeah, we're proud of him.
-Uh, thanks, pal.

1:39:58.666 --> 1:40:00.500
-(clears throat)
-Noah.

1:40:02.541 --> 1:40:04.125
-Oh.
-Oh. They're ready.

1:40:04.208 --> 1:40:06.000
-Oh. -Oh. All right.
-Congrats. -Wish me luck.

1:40:06.083 --> 1:40:07.916
-Knock 'em dead, champ.
-Get it. (chuckles) -Break a leg.

1:40:08.000 --> 1:40:09.791
-All right.
-All right.

1:40:09.875 --> 1:40:12.291
Oh, happy day. (sighs)

1:40:12.375 --> 1:40:14.375
(ship engine starts)

1:40:15.583 --> 1:40:16.750
I guess we're shipping off, huh?

1:40:16.833 --> 1:40:18.583
Ooh. Let's go look.

1:40:18.666 --> 1:40:20.125
-Yeah.
-Bye.

1:40:20.208 --> 1:40:21.916
-Shall we… -Yeah, bye. -We'll loo--
we'll look out the other window.

1:40:22.000 --> 1:40:24.708
-Yeah, good. -Yeah, mm-hmm.
-That way, that way.

1:40:24.791 --> 1:40:28.375
("Unforgettable" by Jonah Mutono playing)

1:41:17.791 --> 1:41:19.791
(lively chatter)

1:41:25.750 --> 1:41:28.291
-(song ends)
-(dance music playing in distance)

1:41:28.375 --> 1:41:30.166
-Hey, hey.
-Hey.

1:41:30.250 --> 1:41:32.416
-I have been looking for ya.
-Yeah?

1:41:32.500 --> 1:41:33.750
-Yeah.
-(chuckles)

1:41:33.833 --> 1:41:35.083
Hey, what's going on?

1:41:35.166 --> 1:41:36.708
Uh, n-nothing.

1:41:36.791 --> 1:41:38.541
You know, just getting some fresh air.

1:41:39.833 --> 1:41:41.500
You okay?

1:41:41.583 --> 1:41:43.000
I'm fine.

1:41:44.583 --> 1:41:47.583
This isn't because Logan is here, is it?

1:41:47.666 --> 1:41:49.125
Peter.

1:41:50.208 --> 1:41:51.666
-Peter.
-Hey, why did you say

1:41:51.750 --> 1:41:53.833
you always knew
I could start my own company?

1:41:53.916 --> 1:41:56.208
-What?
-Before when we were talking,

1:41:56.291 --> 1:41:57.833
you said you always knew I could do it.

1:41:58.916 --> 1:42:00.708
Right. Because I did.

1:42:00.791 --> 1:42:02.041
No, you didn't.

1:42:02.125 --> 1:42:03.708
-What do you mean?
-You didn't believe in me, Anne.

1:42:03.791 --> 1:42:05.416
(stammers softly)

1:42:05.500 --> 1:42:07.125
Why would you say that?

1:42:07.208 --> 1:42:09.208
I mean, Emma believed in me
more than you ever did.

1:42:09.291 --> 1:42:10.750
-Emma?
-Yeah.

1:42:10.833 --> 1:42:11.958
Emma.

1:42:12.041 --> 1:42:13.750
I'm sorry. Uh…

1:42:15.416 --> 1:42:17.166
Wait, what does this have to do with Emma?

1:42:17.250 --> 1:42:19.083
Wait, Pet-- Peter!

1:42:19.166 --> 1:42:20.333
("Baby I Need Your Loving"
by Four Tops playing)

1:42:20.416 --> 1:42:21.416
Emma.

1:42:21.500 --> 1:42:23.500
-Huh?
-Look, I am so sorry.

1:42:23.583 --> 1:42:25.416
-What? -About blowing you off
and saying we can't hang out.

1:42:25.500 --> 1:42:26.500
I miss you.

1:42:26.583 --> 1:42:28.208
-I miss you so much.
-What?

1:42:28.291 --> 1:42:29.625
-Uh, listen, we…
-Peter, are you…

1:42:29.708 --> 1:42:31.250
…we know each other
better than I let on, okay?

1:42:31.333 --> 1:42:32.333
We're-we're friends.

1:42:32.416 --> 1:42:34.208
-We're not friends. You used me.
-That's not true, Emma.

1:42:34.291 --> 1:42:35.958
-Used her for what?
-No, I didn't.

1:42:36.041 --> 1:42:37.666
-We used each other.
-I don't want to do this, Peter.

1:42:37.750 --> 1:42:39.333
-Emma, please. Please wait.
-We're at a wedding.

1:42:39.416 --> 1:42:43.041
L-Look, remember what you told me
about how the-the slow burn

1:42:43.125 --> 1:42:46.666
that gets under your skin, you said that
that's the rarest kind of person, Emma?

1:42:48.416 --> 1:42:50.541
You're my slow burn.

1:42:52.583 --> 1:42:55.000
Okay, I'm gonna need somebody to tell me
what the fuck is going on right now!

1:42:55.083 --> 1:42:56.166
-Whoa, whoa.
-Hi, guys.

1:42:56.250 --> 1:42:57.375
Hey, guys, what the hell's going on?

1:42:57.458 --> 1:42:59.500
-I think she's sleeping with my boyfriend.
-No.

1:42:59.583 --> 1:43:01.291
-Okay, calm down.
I'm not sleeping with anyone. -It's…

1:43:01.375 --> 1:43:02.833
-Yeah, that's not what this is.
-Then what?

1:43:02.916 --> 1:43:05.041
-What is this?
-Hi. What's going on?

1:43:05.125 --> 1:43:06.125
Oh. Uh…

1:43:06.208 --> 1:43:07.708
-Don't.
-Okay.

1:43:07.791 --> 1:43:08.916
-No, don't.
-It's fine.

1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:12.708
Peter and I became friends
after we both got dumped.

1:43:12.791 --> 1:43:14.000
No, don't do this.

1:43:14.083 --> 1:43:18.625
We decided to help each other…

1:43:18.708 --> 1:43:20.500
(scoffs) …win you both back.

1:43:20.583 --> 1:43:24.291
And my job was to break up you and Logan,

1:43:24.375 --> 1:43:28.166
and his job was to break up you and Ginny.

1:43:30.458 --> 1:43:32.458
It sounds crazy
when she says it like that.

1:43:32.541 --> 1:43:34.750
-That is so fucked.
-What the fuck?

1:43:34.833 --> 1:43:36.125
Hold on.

1:43:36.208 --> 1:43:38.833
So were you even in Little Shop
in high school?

1:43:41.166 --> 1:43:44.000
Oh. So you're insane.

1:43:44.083 --> 1:43:45.291
Great.

1:43:48.833 --> 1:43:50.458
Noah, you need to get
these people out of here.

1:43:50.541 --> 1:43:51.625
Please, right now.

1:43:51.708 --> 1:43:53.375
Okay, but we're on a boat.

1:43:53.458 --> 1:43:55.208
Okay, well, just figure it out!

1:43:55.291 --> 1:43:58.041
Listen, we-we thought
you were the loves of our lives,

1:43:58.125 --> 1:43:59.625
and we just wanted to get you back.

1:43:59.708 --> 1:44:01.250
And you got her, Peter.

1:44:01.333 --> 1:44:02.625
But I made a mistake, Emma.

1:44:02.708 --> 1:44:04.916
You got to be kidding me.

1:44:05.000 --> 1:44:06.375
You abandoned me.

1:44:06.458 --> 1:44:08.083
After everything?

1:44:08.166 --> 1:44:10.166
(sniffles) We were so close. You…

1:44:10.250 --> 1:44:12.166
It was so easy for you
to just forget about me.

1:44:12.250 --> 1:44:14.541
No, it-it really wasn't.

1:44:14.625 --> 1:44:15.708
You're too late.

1:44:15.791 --> 1:44:18.125
You're not who I thought you were.

1:44:18.208 --> 1:44:21.666
And maybe I'm your slow burn,
but you're not mine.

1:44:28.250 --> 1:44:30.083
Screw you, Peter.

1:44:31.166 --> 1:44:32.708
(Peter sighs)

1:44:34.041 --> 1:44:36.916
Noah, let me just say one-one thing.

1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:39.541
-(grunts, groans)
-(guests gasp)

1:44:41.166 --> 1:44:42.625
(groans)

1:45:06.041 --> 1:45:07.291
Anne?

1:45:09.458 --> 1:45:11.000
Anne, are you awake?

1:45:14.625 --> 1:45:17.500
Yes, but I'm not speaking to you.

1:45:21.208 --> 1:45:22.916
That's okay. Uh…

1:45:25.375 --> 1:45:27.541
I'd just like to say some stuff,
all right?

1:45:34.125 --> 1:45:35.708
(sighs)

1:45:35.791 --> 1:45:37.125
You know, even…

1:45:39.166 --> 1:45:41.750
…even though we're really mad
at each other right now…

1:45:45.208 --> 1:45:48.541
…I don't regret spending
all those years together.

1:45:48.625 --> 1:45:50.458
Not even a little.

1:45:52.125 --> 1:45:54.250
We built a home together.

1:45:57.541 --> 1:46:02.750
All of our grandparents and two sickly
cats died while we were together, and…

1:46:02.833 --> 1:46:06.125
I think we really loved each other a lot.

1:46:06.208 --> 1:46:08.083
That makes me feel lucky.

1:46:10.458 --> 1:46:14.083
And if you want to say how you feel,
I-I think that'd be nice.

1:46:15.875 --> 1:46:17.375
(sighs heavily)

1:46:27.208 --> 1:46:30.625
I thought dating Logan
was gonna turn me into this…

1:46:32.291 --> 1:46:36.250
…free-spirited artist
that I so dreamt of being.

1:46:36.333 --> 1:46:39.041
But maybe that's not me.

1:46:39.125 --> 1:46:43.291
Maybe I'm sort of a uptight woman
that teaches English

1:46:43.375 --> 1:46:47.583
and loves to talk about theater
and does not do threesomes, and…

1:46:47.666 --> 1:46:49.333
(chuckles softly)

1:46:49.416 --> 1:46:51.333
…that's okay.

1:46:51.416 --> 1:46:53.375
It's more than okay.

1:46:53.458 --> 1:46:55.791
It suits you perfectly.

1:46:57.458 --> 1:46:59.416
I feel lucky, too, Peter.

1:47:02.083 --> 1:47:03.375
Thanks.

1:47:06.208 --> 1:47:08.833
Except that time that you got a woman
to break up me and my new boyfriend.

1:47:08.916 --> 1:47:10.333
I don't feel lucky about that time.

1:47:10.416 --> 1:47:12.416
Uh, nor should you.

1:47:17.333 --> 1:47:18.791
Good to see y'all.

1:47:20.708 --> 1:47:22.875
Noah.

1:47:22.958 --> 1:47:24.458
-(clears throat)
-Hold on.

1:47:24.541 --> 1:47:26.458
-Emma…
-Wait. Uh, no, no, I-I get it.

1:47:26.541 --> 1:47:27.750
Just a sec.

1:47:28.875 --> 1:47:30.208
(sighs)

1:47:31.500 --> 1:47:34.333
I am so sorry for everything.

1:47:34.416 --> 1:47:36.333
I need you to know
I was in a really bad place.

1:47:36.416 --> 1:47:37.833
And I'm not saying that's an excuse.

1:47:37.916 --> 1:47:41.833
It's not, but… I'm sorry.

1:47:41.916 --> 1:47:45.250
Um… and that's all.

1:47:46.333 --> 1:47:47.500
Uh, okay, hold on.

1:47:47.583 --> 1:47:49.583
You know what I don't understand?

1:47:49.666 --> 1:47:52.291
A lot of the time when we were together,
you seemed bored.

1:47:52.375 --> 1:47:54.875
I mean, I'm not that funny,

1:47:54.958 --> 1:47:58.458
and you hated talking about nutrition.

1:47:58.541 --> 1:47:59.583
(chuckles)

1:47:59.666 --> 1:48:01.625
Were we even that compatible?

1:48:03.208 --> 1:48:04.916
No, I don't think we were.

1:48:06.375 --> 1:48:08.625
So why did you want me back so bad?

1:48:10.208 --> 1:48:13.458
Oh, I think I just wanted
the search to be over.

1:48:13.541 --> 1:48:15.916
But maybe you can't force it.

1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:18.291
Maybe you just have to do
the best you can on your own,

1:48:18.375 --> 1:48:24.000
and if you do a really good job
and you're lucky,

1:48:24.083 --> 1:48:26.208
then you find someone.

1:48:26.291 --> 1:48:27.791
The way you found Ginny.

1:48:30.333 --> 1:48:31.583
Yeah.

1:48:31.666 --> 1:48:34.000
So, good job.

1:48:34.083 --> 1:48:35.750
(laughs)

1:48:35.833 --> 1:48:37.333
But I mean it.

1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.666
-You take care, okay?
-'Kay.

1:48:46.750 --> 1:48:48.166
And stay away from my wife.

1:48:48.250 --> 1:48:49.791
(chuckles nervously)

1:48:49.875 --> 1:48:51.375
I'm serious.

1:48:51.458 --> 1:48:52.875
Okay.

1:48:59.958 --> 1:49:01.250
Yes.

1:49:01.333 --> 1:49:03.291
How was your stay?

1:49:03.375 --> 1:49:04.583
Oh, very, very bad.

1:49:04.666 --> 1:49:05.666
(sighs) Yeah.

1:49:11.791 --> 1:49:13.541
Oh. Hi.

1:49:13.625 --> 1:49:15.625
(indistinct chatter)

1:49:19.083 --> 1:49:21.416
How are you? Right this way.

1:49:21.500 --> 1:49:23.500
Thank you. Can I see your ticket?

1:49:23.583 --> 1:49:25.125
(whispers):
Perfect.

FLIGHT ATTENDANT (over P.A.):
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:49:45.916 --> 1:49:48.708
the captain has turned on
the "fasten seat belt" sign.

1:49:48.791 --> 1:49:51.583
Please return to your seats
and keep your seat belt fastened.

1:49:51.666 --> 1:49:52.875
Thank you.

PILOT (over P.A.):
Folks, this is your captain speaking.

1:50:27.875 --> 1:50:30.208
Nothing to worry about.
Just a sudden air pocket there.

1:50:30.291 --> 1:50:32.250
But everything's gonna be just fine.

1:50:32.333 --> 1:50:34.583
You can remove those oxygen masks now.
