Oh.

03:12.760 --> 03:13.659
Yeah.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.763
Does your mom
know you got that?

03:17.765 --> 03:19.798
Yeah, my mom actually
got it with me.

03:19.800 --> 03:23.202
She convinced us both to do it.

I've been really great.

03:37.985 --> 03:40.552
I mean, not great, you know.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.553
Everything with my mom.

03:41.555 --> 03:45.757
But, um, where am I staying?

03:50.664 --> 03:51.863
What's that?

03:51.865 --> 03:53.599
Oh, you don't
want to go up there.

03:57.972 --> 03:58.904
All right.

What you think?

04:04.712 --> 04:05.677
You like?

Oh, and about school.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.432
I already signed you up.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.334
All you have to do is go
down, so you don't have

04:29.336 --> 04:30.636
to worry about no orientation.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.304
All you have to do is
show up like you've

04:32.306 --> 04:33.272
been going for a year.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.006
All right.

Um, yeah.

I think I'm going to go to bed.

04:40.347 --> 04:41.747
All right.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.048
You don't want me to read
you no bed time stories

04:43.050 --> 04:44.516
or nothing like that, right?
- No, I don't.

04:44.518 --> 04:45.917
Thanks.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.826
I mean, yeah, I guess
I am for a little bit.

08:14.828 --> 08:18.230
I'm coming from Detroit, so
I'm just here for a few weeks.

08:50.898 --> 08:52.597
Where is it?
I don't get the schedule at all.

08:52.599 --> 08:53.732
Yeah, the schedule
fucking sucks.

08:53.734 --> 08:54.833

10:05.105 --> 10:06.004
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry, Ms. Peterson.

MS. PETERSON: I don't
want to hear it.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.011
All right.

10:13.013 --> 10:16.348
Um, everybody, we
have a new student.

10:16.350 --> 10:17.749
Nick, why don't you stand up?

10:17.751 --> 10:18.783
Oh, no.
It's OK.

10:18.785 --> 10:19.718
MS. PETERSON: Oh, no, really.

10:19.720 --> 10:20.385
I insist.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.631
Why don't you
introduce yourself?

10:32.633 --> 10:36.067
Uh, well, you
already called me Nick,

10:36.069 --> 10:38.303
so they kind of already
know what they need to know.

10:38.305 --> 10:41.172
But in case you're hard
of hearing, I'm Nick.

10:41.174 --> 10:42.107

10:51.251 --> 10:53.218
When someone talks
to me like that,

10:53.220 --> 10:54.753
what am I supposed to
do, let that happen?

10:54.755 --> 10:56.221
You've got to fucking think--

10:56.223 --> 10:57.422
I'm going to get up in
their motherfucking grill, yo.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.957
I'm not that kind of person.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.158
You can't be getting up
in motherfuckers' grills

11:00.160 --> 11:02.093
all the time, right?

11:02.095 --> 11:03.862
You think stuff through.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.096
Motherfuckers can't think that
they can get up in my grill--

11:05.098 --> 11:08.400
[interposing voices]

11:08.402 --> 11:11.403
Yo, [inaudible]

Yo, sick.

What up, man?

11:28.121 --> 11:29.054
I'm Seamus.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.155
This is Russell.

11:30.157 --> 11:32.257
RUSSELL: Yeah.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.792
What's up, [inaudible]
- What's up?

11:33.794 --> 11:34.993
Russell, man.

11:34.995 --> 11:36.761
Yo, that shit was
so funny earlier.

11:36.763 --> 11:38.063
I was fucking dying laughing.

11:38.065 --> 11:39.864
Yeah.

11:39.866 --> 11:41.066
She always does that stand up
in front of the class bullshit.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.867
It's the worst.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.202
You have no idea about how bad
I want to hate fuck that angel.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.203
I was a dick.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.738
No, yeah.

11:46.740 --> 11:47.872
We were all fucking dying.
It was hilarious.

11:47.874 --> 11:49.040
Don't let that shit burn out.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.108
Look at this
contraption you got,

11:50.110 --> 11:51.476
man, with the car freshener.

11:51.478 --> 11:52.977
Man, this is intricate, dude.

11:52.979 --> 11:54.412
RUSSELL: Did you make this?
- Yeah.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.014
RUSSELL: It's tight.
- Can you hold that?

11:56.016 --> 11:57.782
No.

11:57.784 --> 11:59.250
Why do you always think I'm
just going to hold your shit?

11:59.252 --> 12:00.418
Can you please just fucking--
I would hold it for you.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.920
Fine, I'll hold it.
I'll hold it.

12:01.922 --> 12:02.987
- Thank you.
- Just ask me next time, man.

12:02.989 --> 12:03.955
[bell ringing]
SEAMUS: Fuck.

12:03.957 --> 12:04.856
I've got to get to French.

12:04.858 --> 12:05.757
Are you free right now?

12:05.759 --> 12:06.958
Uh, I mean, I think so.

12:06.960 --> 12:08.159
I have no idea.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.394
I don't get my
schedule at all, but.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.829
Wait, you take French?
Why?

12:10.831 --> 12:12.230
That's hard as fuck, right?
- Yeah, man.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.198
It's super fucking hard.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.966
I'm failing the fuck out.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.001
But I want to learn so bad and
just speak it all the time,

12:17.003 --> 12:18.069
order crepes in French and shit.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.204
I mean, that sounds--

12:19.206 --> 12:21.039
yo, what the fuck?

12:21.041 --> 12:22.307
I didn't get a hit.

12:22.309 --> 12:23.742
I'll give you
one, motherfucker.

12:23.744 --> 12:24.876
Relax.

12:24.878 --> 12:25.744
He's a fucking lunatic.
Watch out.

12:25.746 --> 12:26.878
It's true.

12:26.880 --> 12:27.879
SEAMUS: Let me
see your schedule.

Oh.

12:34.387 --> 12:35.487
It's like hieroglyphics.

12:39.893 --> 12:42.460
Dude, you have
English right now.

12:42.462 --> 12:43.394
Are you serious?

12:43.396 --> 12:44.896
Yeah, but you're good.

12:44.898 --> 12:45.830
She's super cool about
that kind of thing.

12:45.832 --> 12:47.232
She's a huge donor.

12:47.234 --> 12:48.767
We see her asleep in class
literally all the time.

12:48.769 --> 12:49.467
Really?

12:49.469 --> 12:50.435
That's really funny.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.402
SEAMUS: Yeah.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.403
She's fucking brain dead.

12:52.405 --> 12:55.406
Hey, what are you doing Friday?

12:55.408 --> 12:56.307
Nothing.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.909
I'm bored as fuck.

12:57.911 --> 12:59.377
Well, yo, I mean, if
you're not doing anything,

12:59.379 --> 13:00.879
you should come check on
this party at the [inaudible]

13:00.881 --> 13:02.147

21:18.878 --> 21:21.012
It's very fitting.

21:21.014 --> 21:22.813
The smell of this
house kind of reminds me

21:22.815 --> 21:28.586
of field trips I took to museums
in, like, fourth grade, which

21:28.588 --> 21:30.388
is kind of depressing
because that

21:30.390 --> 21:34.392
means that I haven't been to a
museum in, like, seven years.

made that up right now.

22:00.787 --> 22:02.953

parents and cousins and stuff.

22:02.955 --> 22:05.723
We would go, like, every
other weekend for years.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.926
And there was this
smell in the house.

22:08.928 --> 22:10.995
And I could-- I
could smell it right

22:10.997 --> 22:12.396
now when I think about it.

22:12.398 --> 22:19.537
It was, like, this
leathery sort of--

22:19.539 --> 22:22.940
it was, like, a weird
tangy smell, which wasn't

22:22.942 --> 22:24.475
even the best smell, but I--

22:24.477 --> 22:26.977
I just always remembered
it as my country house.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.680
So, anyway, I walked
in the house one day,

22:29.682 --> 22:33.484
and it smelled
completely different.

22:33.486 --> 22:34.652
And I was, like, 14.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.354
And I went up to
my mom, and I was

22:36.356 --> 22:40.458
like, what the fuck happened
to the smell of the house?

22:40.460 --> 22:43.027
She was like, I got rid
of the couch in the den

22:43.029 --> 22:48.599
because it was old and torn up
and I needed to throw it out.

22:48.601 --> 22:49.533
I know, right?

22:49.535 --> 22:50.935

22:50.937 --> 22:53.504
And I was so mad at her
because my whole childhood

22:53.506 --> 22:54.438
was with that smell.

He seems distant.

start kissing me in public.

1:10:14.578 --> 1:10:18.346
It's the last few lines in this
poem, "The Cat and the Moon."

1:10:18.348 --> 1:10:19.647
It's this tattoo on my back.

1:10:26.590 --> 1:10:28.957
He would, like, tuck me in.

1:10:28.959 --> 1:10:32.260
And then he'd start to walk
out, but he never actually left.

1:10:32.262 --> 1:10:34.762
He just waited in the
doorway until I said,

1:10:34.764 --> 1:10:37.532
daddy, daddy, daddy, come back.

1:10:37.534 --> 1:10:38.800
And then he'd come
back, and he'd

1:10:38.802 --> 1:10:40.468
sit on the edge of the bed.

1:10:40.470 --> 1:10:43.004
And he'd recite the whole
thing for me in, like,

1:10:43.006 --> 1:10:45.540
a different accent every night
or, like, a different way

1:10:45.542 --> 1:10:47.976
of doing it or something.

1:10:47.978 --> 1:10:49.944
And then I'd always
get really tired

1:10:49.946 --> 1:10:52.380
when I heard those last
two lines and fall asleep.

1:10:56.486 --> 1:10:58.019
I honestly think the
reason for my insomnia

1:10:58.021 --> 1:11:00.788
in the past few years is
that I'm always waiting

1:11:00.790 --> 1:11:03.391
to hear those last few lines.

1:11:03.393 --> 1:11:09.597
But, you know, they
obviously never come.

1:11:09.599 --> 1:11:10.898
It's weird, though.

1:11:10.900 --> 1:11:14.269
It's like my sleep's
never 100% because I'm

1:11:14.271 --> 1:11:16.404
always waiting to
hear his voice,

1:11:16.406 --> 1:11:17.972
as stupid as that sounds.

1:11:17.974 --> 1:11:18.840
Why is that stupid?

1:11:28.451 --> 1:11:29.417
I don't know.

1:11:38.828 --> 1:11:41.829
When did he pass away?

1:11:41.831 --> 1:11:48.836
Um, I was about 12, so I guess
it was, like, five years ago.

1:11:51.374 --> 1:11:52.640
Yeah.

1:11:52.642 --> 1:11:55.710
It was this really
weird thing where, um--

1:11:55.712 --> 1:11:58.446
I told you he was
in a band with Cal.

1:11:58.448 --> 1:12:02.317
And they had a lot
of problems, I think,

1:12:02.319 --> 1:12:04.052
so they broke up a
little while ago.

1:12:04.054 --> 1:12:09.724
But then they wanted to do
this reunion show thing,

1:12:09.726 --> 1:12:18.633
so my dad came to New
York to stay here with Cal

1:12:18.635 --> 1:12:19.934
and, like, rehearse
and get ready

1:12:19.936 --> 1:12:21.536
for the show and all of that.

1:12:21.538 --> 1:12:25.873
And, um, I don't really
know what happened,

1:12:25.875 --> 1:12:33.681
but, um, there was a
fight and my dad went out

1:12:33.683 --> 1:12:34.982
and got really fucked up.

1:12:34.984 --> 1:12:38.953
And he was in the subway.

1:12:38.955 --> 1:12:41.489
And I guess he blacked out.

1:12:41.491 --> 1:12:44.959
And he slipped on something
on the edge of the platform

1:12:44.961 --> 1:12:47.895
and, um--

1:12:47.897 --> 1:12:48.796
yeah.

1:12:56.773 --> 1:13:01.442
And the worst part is these
fucking cops all said to my mom

1:13:01.444 --> 1:13:04.912
that maybe, like, he jumped
in front of it or something

1:13:04.914 --> 1:13:08.683
because from, like,
where his remains were

1:13:08.685 --> 1:13:11.419
from the positioning of his
body when the train hit him,

1:13:11.421 --> 1:13:14.589
it didn't seem like an
accident or something.

1:13:14.591 --> 1:13:16.624
And of course my mom
believed it because she's

1:13:16.626 --> 1:13:18.059
insanely gullible.

1:13:18.061 --> 1:13:22.897
But I know in my heart that
that is total bullshit.

1:13:25.668 --> 1:13:31.539
Like, he-- he just wasn't
like that, you know.

1:13:31.541 --> 1:13:36.043
I mean, some people
are, but he just--

1:13:36.045 --> 1:13:37.478
he wasn't selfish like that.

1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:41.816
He-- I just can't imagine--

1:13:45.021 --> 1:13:46.087
yeah, he didn't.

1:14:00.503 --> 1:14:02.904
What?

1:14:02.906 --> 1:14:03.805
Nothing.

1:14:07.777 --> 1:14:11.212
Well, the whole thing is
just so stupid and fucked up.

1:14:16.753 --> 1:14:19.821
I just-- I just wish that I
could, like, smell, like, a--

1:14:31.801 --> 1:14:36.537
smell, like, a sweater
again or, you know,

1:14:36.539 --> 1:14:38.039
smell his hair
again or something,

1:14:38.041 --> 1:14:46.247
you know, because I just--

1:14:46.249 --> 1:14:48.950
I don't-- I don't
remember what it--

1:14:48.952 --> 1:14:50.485
what it smells like.

1:14:50.487 --> 1:14:51.619
I don't remember what
his hair smells like.

1:14:55.091 --> 1:14:56.023
Sorry.

1:14:56.025 --> 1:14:59.794
I don't-- I'm sorry.

1:14:59.796 --> 1:15:01.562
This is embarrassing.

1:15:01.564 --> 1:15:04.532
[inaudible] I feel like I'm just
being so annoying right now.

1:15:04.534 --> 1:15:05.266
ELIZA: No, you're not.

1:15:05.268 --> 1:15:06.167
Yeah, I am.

1:15:06.169 --> 1:15:07.101
I'm being so annoying.

1:15:07.103 --> 1:15:09.670
Please don't be sorry.

1:15:09.672 --> 1:15:10.671
You're OK.

1:15:10.673 --> 1:15:12.039
I'm so stupid.
ELIZA: No.

1:15:12.041 --> 1:15:13.174
I'm so stupid.

1:15:13.176 --> 1:15:14.642
You're not stupid.
- Yeah, it is.

1:15:14.644 --> 1:15:15.643
It's stupid.

1:15:15.645 --> 1:15:16.544
ELIZA: No, it's not stupid.

1:15:16.546 --> 1:15:17.945

1:16:07.730 --> 1:16:11.132
That's a great mouth
trumpet you got there.

1:16:11.134 --> 1:16:14.201
Yeah, I'm pretty goddamn
good at mouth trumpet.

1:16:14.203 --> 1:16:15.136

They're kind of nice, right?

1:16:18.074 --> 1:16:19.840
Like, I can see my
dad playing this

1:16:19.842 --> 1:16:23.911
and then you playing, like,
that line on sax or something.

- Yeah.
- Something like that.

1:16:42.632 --> 1:16:46.200
Hey, um, I got some news.

1:16:46.202 --> 1:16:50.037
I got a call from
your mom today.

1:16:50.039 --> 1:16:54.342
She said that she was
doing good and it was cool

1:16:54.344 --> 1:16:55.376
for you to come back next week.

1:17:00.183 --> 1:17:04.385
That's, like-- that's
a few weeks early, right?

1:17:04.387 --> 1:17:06.887
CAL: Yeah.

1:17:06.889 --> 1:17:08.756
Well, she said
she was doing good

1:17:08.758 --> 1:17:12.326
and, um, she's
excited to see you.

1:17:20.637 --> 1:17:22.003
OK.

1:17:22.005 --> 1:17:23.671
All right.

1:17:23.673 --> 1:17:26.841
But, like, I mean, the clinic
approved it or whatever?

1:17:26.843 --> 1:17:29.644
Yeah, the clinic
approved her, she said.

1:17:29.646 --> 1:17:32.313
And, uh, I talked
to her on the phone.

1:17:32.315 --> 1:17:33.247
She sounded pretty good.

1:17:36.252 --> 1:17:37.418
I think it's a
good thing, right?

1:17:39.956 --> 1:17:40.855

That was pretty cool.

1:18:25.101 --> 1:18:26.000

[chuckling]

1:20:14.844 --> 1:20:18.179
Hey, I want to ask you
an honest question.

1:20:18.181 --> 1:20:20.014
Does it have
anything to do with not

1:20:20.016 --> 1:20:22.183
feeling so fresh down there?

1:20:22.185 --> 1:20:23.884

1:20:23.886 --> 1:20:26.020
What is it?

1:20:26.022 --> 1:20:30.057
Um, how do you feel
about everything?

1:20:30.059 --> 1:20:33.561
I mean, do you think it's
OK for you to go back?

1:20:33.563 --> 1:20:35.162
What do you mean, with my mom?

1:20:35.164 --> 1:20:36.063
Yeah.

1:20:36.065 --> 1:20:37.198
Just--

1:20:37.200 --> 1:20:38.465
NICK: You mean is it safe?

1:20:38.467 --> 1:20:39.466
No, no.

1:20:39.468 --> 1:20:42.403
Not-- not-- not is it safe.

1:20:42.405 --> 1:20:45.406
Well, what else
am I supposed to do?

1:20:45.408 --> 1:20:46.340
CAL: Uh--

1:20:46.342 --> 1:20:47.875
I gotta go back.

1:20:47.877 --> 1:20:48.576
I don't know.

1:20:48.578 --> 1:20:49.476
Do you?

1:20:51.881 --> 1:20:57.585
Well, I mean, I'm all she has.

1:20:57.587 --> 1:21:02.122
I mean, yeah, it's a bummer,
but if she's feeling better

1:21:02.124 --> 1:21:05.392
and they're letting her out,
then, yeah, I gotta go back.

1:21:05.394 --> 1:21:07.161
CAL: I don't know
if they let her out

1:21:07.163 --> 1:21:08.262
or if she chose to leave.

1:21:08.264 --> 1:21:09.163
I don't know.

1:21:12.368 --> 1:21:14.101
I mean, she's still
my guardian, you know.

1:21:14.103 --> 1:21:17.471
She's still my mom.

1:21:17.473 --> 1:21:20.574
CAL: Well, I was just
thinking about it.

1:21:20.576 --> 1:21:23.010
I mean, you know, of
course in a perfect world,

1:21:23.012 --> 1:21:26.080
I'd love to stay here with
you in this big house,

1:21:26.082 --> 1:21:29.550

time and hanging in New York,

1:21:29.552 --> 1:21:32.219

everything for me, so.

CAL: Yeah, but you
don't owe her anything.

1:21:36.893 --> 1:21:38.559
Well, I don't really think you
know what you're talking about.

1:21:40.596 --> 1:21:41.495
OK.

1:21:46.936 --> 1:21:48.502
I think you should invest
in some sleeping pills.

1:21:51.474 --> 1:21:52.439

shit out of me.

town this weekend.

It's like, um, just,
like, a last minute thing.

1:22:21.671 --> 1:22:24.238
Huh.

1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:27.374
I haven't really seen you
around or anything, you know.

1:22:27.376 --> 1:22:29.576
It kind of feels like
you've been avoiding me.

No.

swamped with work all week.

to go out tonight?

1:22:40.656 --> 1:22:42.256
I think me and Eliza
are going to get dinner.

1:22:42.258 --> 1:22:43.691
I'm pretty sure Lola's
got nothing going on.

1:22:43.693 --> 1:22:46.493
We could do, like,
a going away thing.

1:22:46.495 --> 1:22:48.128
Well, yeah.

1:22:48.130 --> 1:22:50.230
I mean, thanks for inviting
me, but I don't really

1:22:50.232 --> 1:22:53.067
know if I like Lola like that.

1:22:53.069 --> 1:22:55.202
And, um, I don't know.

1:22:55.204 --> 1:22:56.503
It's like a date
with you and Eliza.

1:22:56.505 --> 1:22:57.738
I don't want to, like,
intrude or anything.

1:22:57.740 --> 1:22:59.239
No.
Dude, no, no, no, no.

1:22:59.241 --> 1:23:00.541
Yo, it's not going to
be like that at all.

1:23:00.543 --> 1:23:01.442

1:23:15.358 --> 1:23:17.257
Take it easy.

1:23:17.259 --> 1:23:19.326
Oh, you-- you said
turn it up a notch?

OK.
