00:01.569 --> 00:05.471
<i> by two separate</i>
<i> yet equally important groups:</i>

00:05.473 --> 00:07.473
<i> the police,</i>
<i> who investigate crime</i>

00:07.475 --> 00:10.476
<i> and the district attorneys,</i>
<i> who prosecute the offenders.</i>

00:10.478 --> 00:12.644
<i> These are their stories.</i>

00:16.484 --> 00:18.484
On the first count
of the indictment,

00:18.486 --> 00:21.186
criminal facilitation
in the first degree,

00:21.188 --> 00:23.088
how does the jury find?

00:23.090 --> 00:24.189
Not guilty.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.291
On the second count
of the indictment,

00:26.293 --> 00:28.193
money laundering
in the first degree,

00:28.195 --> 00:29.428
how does the jury find?

00:29.430 --> 00:31.063
Not guilty.

00:31.065 --> 00:34.233
On the third count
of the indictment,

00:34.235 --> 00:37.569
conspiracy in the fifth degree,
how does the jury find?

00:37.571 --> 00:39.138
Not guilty.

00:39.140 --> 00:41.373
Thank you.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.108
Court is adjourned.

00:43.110 --> 00:46.145
(<i> gavel falls</i> )

00:46.146 --> 00:49.181
The arrest was insulting,
the indictment was ludicrous,

00:49.183 --> 00:51.450
and the result was predictable.

00:51.452 --> 00:53.085
The district attorney

00:53.087 --> 00:55.454
wanted to look tough
on white collar crime,

00:55.456 --> 00:58.090
so they smeared
three innocent men,

00:58.092 --> 01:01.827
but they couldn't bamboozle
a jury of 12 honest New Yorkers.

01:01.829 --> 01:03.462
Thank you.

01:03.464 --> 01:05.264
Mr. Stone?

01:05.266 --> 01:06.598
Yes?

01:06.600 --> 01:09.601
The defense says this
was malicious prosecution.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.603
If the law had allowed it,

01:11.605 --> 01:14.339
I'd have indicted
those defendants for murder.

01:14.341 --> 01:16.241
Wall Street bankers
for murder?

01:16.243 --> 01:18.343
Bankers who helped drug dealers
clean their money

01:18.345 --> 01:20.312
are as guilty
as the drug dealers themselves.

01:20.314 --> 01:23.248
What about that
missing evidence?

01:23.250 --> 01:25.250
I can't comment
on the investigation,

01:25.252 --> 01:27.275
but I do know someone

01:27.276 --> 01:29.299
in the New York City
Police Department

01:29.300 --> 01:31.323
altered evidence by erasing bank
transactions on computer disks,

01:31.325 --> 01:33.325
and that is a felony,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:33.327 --> 01:35.327
and there will be indictments.

01:35.329 --> 01:37.129
This case is not over.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.098
It's just beginning.

03:12.793 --> 03:16.895
Page nine,
first column on the bottom.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.264
How long they
been in there?

03:19.266 --> 03:20.799
About an hour.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.534
Internal Affairs?

03:22.536 --> 03:25.204
Yeah.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.313
What gives?

03:51.314 --> 03:52.964
These guys taking a run
at the whole precinct?

03:52.967 --> 03:55.334
No, just me.

03:55.336 --> 03:58.604
You gave the D.A. three dealers
and their bankers

03:58.606 --> 03:59.605
on a silver platter.

03:59.607 --> 04:01.440
Now they're going after you?

04:01.442 --> 04:04.543
Well, if I was Internal Affairs,
I'd be looking at me, too.

04:04.545 --> 04:07.512
O'Farrell is in charge
of the property clerk's office.

04:07.514 --> 04:09.248
We go back a long way.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.850
He's given me every one
one of my promotions.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.919
He passes out
captain's bars.

04:13.921 --> 04:17.489
So the chief took care of you
for 20 years, so what?

04:17.491 --> 04:19.691
That means you two tampered
with the evidence?

04:19.693 --> 04:22.394
Well, they got to go
after somebody.

04:22.396 --> 04:23.929
Oh, so you're guilty
by association

04:23.931 --> 04:27.299
because O'Farrell runs
the evidence department?

04:27.301 --> 04:29.568
What do they say
happened to the evidence?

04:29.570 --> 04:31.470
Manhattan Mercantile Bank.

04:31.472 --> 04:34.006
Computer disks got erased.

04:34.008 --> 04:37.409
All the illegal transactions
just vanished.

04:37.411 --> 04:40.312
Look, I.A.D., they didn't
tell me who, what or why,

04:40.314 --> 04:43.382
but am I at the top
of their list? Yeah.

04:45.286 --> 04:47.386
How's your appointment book?

04:47.388 --> 04:49.888
Just the Boorman murder.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.324
Getting ready for trial.

04:57.364 --> 04:59.731
What?

04:59.733 --> 05:03.368
I'm in a corner here.

05:03.370 --> 05:06.004
It's an I.A.D. case.

05:06.006 --> 05:09.608
We'll see what we can find out.

05:09.610 --> 05:10.742
Yeah.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.010
Whose collar was it?

05:12.012 --> 05:14.646
Cassidy and Manetti's.

05:14.648 --> 05:18.617
D.A. loses a case,
who gets the shaft?

05:18.619 --> 05:20.552
Cops.

05:21.755 --> 05:25.357
I'm telling you--
we did it by the book.

05:25.359 --> 05:27.492
Ain't no bestseller.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.027
What happened?

05:29.029 --> 05:31.330
Round-the-clock
stakeout.

05:31.332 --> 05:33.765
Colombians doing maybe
a million a year.

05:33.767 --> 05:35.467
Not big dealers.

05:35.469 --> 05:37.436
They live in tenements, right?

05:37.438 --> 05:39.104
One day, we get a break.

05:39.106 --> 05:41.773
They take their money
to Manhattan mercantile.

05:41.775 --> 05:43.775
Four briefcases, cash.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.645
I want to bust in,
get the dealers and the bankers.

05:46.647 --> 05:47.746
Cragen says no.

05:47.748 --> 05:50.048
You got to wait
for the money trail.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.750
Prove they laundered it.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.652
They get some
diode heads downtown

05:53.654 --> 05:55.954
to track the money by computer.

05:55.956 --> 06:00.625
So when Stone goes to trial,
the computer disks are erased.

06:00.627 --> 06:03.362
Right, but only
the incriminating files.

06:03.364 --> 06:06.064
Whoever did it
knew what he was doing.

06:06.066 --> 06:10.469
So to the jury, it looks like
the evidence was never there.

06:10.471 --> 06:14.072
What about the computer jock,
the one who traced the money?

06:14.074 --> 06:15.073
What's his name?

06:15.075 --> 06:16.541
An I.A.D. case.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.410
You're turning over rocks here.

06:18.412 --> 06:25.050
Turn over a rock,
you might find a rattlesnake.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.020
MAN:
They way the D.A.'s screaming

06:29.022 --> 06:31.623
you'd think it was
the first case they ever lost.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.425
Every time's a first time.

06:33.427 --> 06:35.694
So what happened with
these computer disks?

06:35.696 --> 06:37.396
The drug dealers,
the Colombians?

06:37.398 --> 06:38.397
They leave the bank.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.399
We wait three days,
then bust in.

06:40.401 --> 06:41.666
I take two disks.

06:41.668 --> 06:43.635
It shows the drug money
was wired offshore.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.354
The Cayman Islands.

06:45.355 --> 06:47.072
All right, so you
saw the files, the
evidence was there.

06:47.074 --> 06:51.443
Yeah, I saw the files right
on my computer screen.

06:51.445 --> 06:54.012
You didn't make a printout?

06:54.014 --> 06:57.048
I'm leaving for my honeymoon--
Bermuda.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.551
They say cancel.
I say go to hell.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.787
Send the disk
to the property clerk.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.789
I'll do the trial work
when I get back.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.658
And when you get back,
the disks are changed.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.826
You got it.

07:07.828 --> 07:12.063
This captain,
what's his name, um, Cragen?

07:12.065 --> 07:13.465
What's his story?

07:13.467 --> 07:16.101
You hear stuff, you know.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.736
What do you hear?

07:17.738 --> 07:18.837
Everything I heard,

07:18.839 --> 07:20.605
I already told three times.

07:20.607 --> 07:23.074
Don't you guys at I.A.D.
talk to each other?

07:24.745 --> 07:26.144
I.A.D.?

07:27.848 --> 07:29.181
(<i> sighs</i> )

07:29.183 --> 07:31.616
Real smooth, Sergeant.

07:31.618 --> 07:35.120
I.A.D. swears me in blood
not to talk about this case.

07:35.122 --> 07:40.225
You don't tell them,
we don't tell them.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.593
Wow.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.595
This is freaking amazing.

07:43.597 --> 07:47.098
I don't know a computer disk
from a slipped disk.

07:47.100 --> 07:49.734
Well, your name's
getting tossed around.

07:49.736 --> 07:52.204
It's the same song everywhere.

07:52.206 --> 07:55.674
People are saying
O'Farrell's your rabbi.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.109
He's in charge
of the property clerk,

07:58.111 --> 08:01.713
so your detectives knew
when the evidence was there.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.516
And what do you say?

08:04.518 --> 08:08.119
He's reporting,
not accusing.

08:10.791 --> 08:13.191
I.A.D. tells you
you're under investigation.

08:13.193 --> 08:16.928
They mention why they think
you'd help these three bankers?

08:16.930 --> 08:19.531
One thing they lean on
over and over,

08:19.533 --> 08:21.199
they keep saying that I talked
to the chief

08:21.201 --> 08:22.834
every couple of days
while this case is running.

08:22.836 --> 08:23.902
What did we talk about?

08:23.904 --> 08:25.937
You talk to him lately?

08:25.939 --> 08:29.574
With I.A.D. probably listening
in on my phone line?

08:29.576 --> 08:30.575
No.

08:30.577 --> 08:33.912
Doesn't mean we can't.

08:33.914 --> 08:37.749
So this young D.A.,
maybe two years on the force--

08:37.751 --> 08:40.652
this D.A., three weeks
out of Harvard, mind you,

08:40.654 --> 08:44.289
he says to me, "Officer,
can you tell me the difference

08:44.291 --> 08:45.857
between suspicion
and probable cause?"

08:45.859 --> 08:48.860
So I look him
in the eye and I say,

08:48.862 --> 08:52.831
"Can you tell me what is in
section 129 of the penal law?"

08:52.833 --> 08:54.833
And he says,

08:54.835 --> 08:57.836
"I'll look it up."

09:03.877 --> 09:06.711
What is in section 129?

09:06.713 --> 09:08.880
There is no section 129.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.850
He was a good cop.

09:11.852 --> 09:16.254
Listen, we know we're
out of our league here.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.189
We really appreciate you
talking to us.

09:18.191 --> 09:20.258
That's all right.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.927
So why they after you
and Cragen?

09:21.929 --> 09:25.797
All right, you're Schiff,
you got an election coming up.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.832
You've just blown
the bankers case.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.734
What do you do?
You go after some Irish cops.

09:29.736 --> 09:30.802
But the evidence.

09:30.804 --> 09:31.903
Ethnic politics.

09:31.905 --> 09:33.305
It never dies.

09:33.307 --> 09:35.941
Something did happen to it.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.011
Don Cragen and me.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.780
Now you just ask yourself:

09:41.782 --> 09:45.684
Does it make any sense
for us to risk what we've got?

09:45.686 --> 09:47.819
My guess, some kid

09:47.821 --> 09:51.022
in the D.A.'s office
checked out the disks,

09:51.024 --> 09:52.691
and he louses them up.

09:54.828 --> 09:57.963
I.A.D.'s after cops.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.864
If there is a cop
involved in this,

09:59.866 --> 10:01.766
I will buy
the whole department dinner.

10:01.768 --> 10:03.201
From what this steak cost,

10:03.203 --> 10:05.770
you'll have to take out
a second mortgage.

10:05.772 --> 10:08.873
Only if I'm wrong.

10:11.211 --> 10:14.613
MAN:
The Boorman case.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.214
Pretty thorough, you guys.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.950
Yeah, well, we always
check our evidence twice

10:18.952 --> 10:21.786
before we testify.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.054
Right.

10:23.056 --> 10:26.858
And my diet's
working, too.

10:26.860 --> 10:29.060
You were Cragen's partner.

10:29.062 --> 10:30.962
Forget it.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.999
I.A.D.'s got a bullet
with his name on it.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.034
They're after a good cop.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.003
We're all good cops.

10:38.005 --> 10:40.038
Even the dirty ones.

10:40.040 --> 10:45.243
I.A.D.,
those jerk shooflies--

10:45.245 --> 10:46.845
tweedle dum
and tweedle dumber--

10:46.847 --> 10:48.313
they come in
and they pop the file cabinets

10:48.315 --> 10:49.981
they copy
every piece of paper.

10:49.983 --> 10:50.982
Like?

10:50.984 --> 10:52.417
Like the sign-in logs.

10:52.419 --> 10:54.085
Like who was here, when.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.054
Mind if we take a look?

11:02.963 --> 11:04.663
Page 57

11:04.665 --> 11:06.031
column three.

11:16.343 --> 11:17.942
What?

11:17.944 --> 11:20.679
The week the evidence
was messed with.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.348
Lots of cops through here,
but your pal, Cragen...

11:23.350 --> 11:25.050
that week twice.
He was here

11:25.052 --> 11:26.818
Two days in a row.

11:26.820 --> 11:28.820
Like he was taking
something out

11:28.822 --> 11:30.955
and bringing it back.

11:38.365 --> 11:41.366
For the rest of my life,
I sign nothing.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.936
I'm going to burn
my dry-cleaning stubs.

11:44.938 --> 11:48.339
So, you gentlemen
would like to know

11:48.341 --> 11:50.341
why I was
at the property clerk.

11:50.343 --> 11:54.112
Joey Buscalera, sergeant
from the fraud squad.
You remember him?

11:54.114 --> 11:55.714
Yeah. He was with us
for what, two months?

11:55.716 --> 11:57.115
Yeah.

11:57.117 --> 12:00.185
I had him on a case--
auto parts.
Chop shop?

12:00.187 --> 12:02.353
Buscalera was testifying
on another case.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.322
No time to do
his evidence summary,

12:04.324 --> 12:06.157
so I drove
to the property clerk

12:06.159 --> 12:07.392
and did it for him.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.395
Do a guy a favor
and look what happens.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.931
What, Max?

12:12.933 --> 12:13.898
What is it?

12:13.900 --> 12:18.136
Property clerk supervisor says

12:18.138 --> 12:20.438
you-you were there
two days in a row.

12:20.440 --> 12:23.942
Now, you drive a hundred blocks
back and forth

12:23.944 --> 12:26.411
two days in a row to help
some detective on loan?

12:26.413 --> 12:29.013
When headquarters is on my tail,

12:29.015 --> 12:30.415
when they're shoving
productivity reports

12:30.417 --> 12:32.217
down my throat?
Yes, Max, I do.

12:33.253 --> 12:35.053
Two days in a row.

12:35.055 --> 12:37.055
That's a lot of favor.

12:37.057 --> 12:41.960
Max, you know the procedure.

12:41.962 --> 12:44.028
I did his evidence summary.

12:44.030 --> 12:46.397
I brought it back here.
He signed it.

12:46.399 --> 12:50.368
I took it back, logged it
and left a copy with the D.A.

12:54.040 --> 12:56.040
Joey, this evidence summary,

12:56.042 --> 12:58.409
the one that Cragen
helped you get ready.

12:58.411 --> 12:59.410
I like Cragen.

12:59.412 --> 13:01.446
He did you a favor?

13:01.448 --> 13:02.781
Would I finger a cop?

13:02.783 --> 13:04.415
I don't cross the blue wall.

13:04.417 --> 13:07.152
Nobody's accusing you.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.186
You know how it is.

13:08.188 --> 13:09.454
You've got to testify
in two trials.

13:09.456 --> 13:10.989
You can't get downtown.

13:10.991 --> 13:12.323
So you asked Cragen.

13:12.325 --> 13:16.427
Not exactly.
Cragen asked if I'm ready.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.029
I'm in a bind.
He volunteers

13:18.031 --> 13:19.998
to go to the property clerk,
do my evidence.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.266
He volunteers?

13:21.268 --> 13:23.234
He's a good cop.

13:23.236 --> 13:27.005
Yeah, yeah, good cop.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.473
Thanks, Joey.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.213
What am I talking,
Swahili?

13:35.215 --> 13:36.481
(<i> door buzzing</i> )

13:36.483 --> 13:38.449
I.A.D.'s all over
this case.

13:38.451 --> 13:40.351
Come on,
you were here.

13:40.353 --> 13:42.320
I thought maybe you could
tell me a little something.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.222
Tonight, I go home
at 6:00.

13:44.224 --> 13:46.558
In the garage,
a '65 Malibu.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.526
Best big six
they ever made.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.595
And when I'm finished
with it, mint condition.

13:50.597 --> 13:55.099
If I.A.D. comes after me
because I'm talking to you,

13:55.101 --> 13:59.604
I will be fixing cars every day
instead of nights and weekends.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.342
24 Years,
that's what Cragen's got in.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.377
I don't know the man.

14:06.379 --> 14:10.348
Look, supposedly Cragen's
the only cop in here

14:10.350 --> 14:12.300
two days in a row.

14:12.301 --> 14:14.251
So, you're saying if somebody
fiddled with the evidence...

14:14.254 --> 14:16.855
Then it must be Cragen.
Yeah.

14:16.857 --> 14:19.357
Or an inside job.

14:20.427 --> 14:23.061
Or both.

14:23.063 --> 14:24.429
You son of a bitch.

14:24.431 --> 14:26.331
If you're ever in trouble,

14:26.333 --> 14:28.499
I sure as hell hope someone
treats you like this.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.636
Hey.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.577
All right.

14:39.579 --> 14:42.280
Upstairs, the men's room.

14:42.282 --> 14:45.450
Five minutes.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.553
Henderson?
He's already divorced.

14:48.555 --> 14:51.556
Lives in a hell-hole
one bedroom way down
on Avenue C.

14:51.558 --> 14:52.590
Avenue C.

14:52.592 --> 14:54.525
You can get killed
in the cross fire

14:54.527 --> 14:56.411
on a good night.

14:56.412 --> 14:58.296
And with his alimony,
he wishes he was dead.

14:58.298 --> 15:00.198
(<i> laughs</i> )
(<i> toilet flushing</i> )

15:00.200 --> 15:01.532
Let's go.

15:31.164 --> 15:32.664
(<i> rattling</i> )

15:32.666 --> 15:34.666
You got a quarter?

15:34.668 --> 15:36.601
Give it a whack.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.603
(<i> sighs</i> )

15:38.605 --> 15:41.306
Cragen volunteered.

15:41.308 --> 15:42.607
Buscalera didn't ask.

15:42.609 --> 15:45.143
Maybe Cragen was
just doing his job.

15:45.145 --> 15:47.478
I gotta keep saying this.
I know he's not dirty,

15:47.480 --> 15:51.115
but now I know why I.A.D.
is going six ways through Sunday

15:51.117 --> 15:53.484
to prove that he is, because
it looks like he wanted to be

15:53.486 --> 15:55.119
at the property
clerk's office.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.488
Yeah. Maybe someone
else did, too.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.190
Look at this.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.225
Property clerk's
duty roster

16:01.227 --> 16:03.127
headquarters'
master roll call.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.495
Now, the week the evidence
was tampered with,

16:04.497 --> 16:07.498
there were 28 cops
and 13 civilians
working there.

16:07.500 --> 16:09.500
Any of them know
Chief O'Farrell?

16:09.502 --> 16:11.602
Assuming it was
O'Farrell's party.

16:11.604 --> 16:13.304
Assuming.

16:13.306 --> 16:17.375
Listen, you want me to dig up
their service records?

16:17.377 --> 16:19.510
(<i> sighs</i> )
Forget reprimand from I.A.D.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.513
That will rate
a full-scale hearing.

16:22.515 --> 16:25.350
Wait a second.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.453
The master roll call
and the duty roster

16:28.455 --> 16:30.221
ought to be identical.

16:30.223 --> 16:33.358
But what's-his-name from the
property clerk's gave you both.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.360
There's got to be
a reason, right?

16:35.362 --> 16:37.428
Yeah.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.664
Master roll call comes
from headquarters

16:39.666 --> 16:41.733
at the beginning of the month.

16:41.735 --> 16:44.535
Duty roster comes out
every Tuesday.

16:44.537 --> 16:48.539
If it's an inside job,
when do they do it?

16:48.541 --> 16:52.010
When there's no traffic.

16:52.012 --> 16:54.412
Give me the names
of everybody

16:54.414 --> 16:56.681
on the duty roster's
third shifts.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.419
Okay.

17:01.421 --> 17:04.422
4:00 to midnight--
Webster.

17:04.424 --> 17:05.523
Mm-hmm.

17:05.525 --> 17:07.291
Dumoze.

17:07.293 --> 17:08.626
Mm-hmm.

17:08.628 --> 17:09.794
McCrory.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.367
No.

17:18.638 --> 17:20.638
He's on the duty roster,

17:20.640 --> 17:23.441
but headquarters
doesn't show him as working

17:23.443 --> 17:26.544
on the master roll call.

17:30.550 --> 17:31.716
Hah.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.619
Headquarters says
Officer Al McCrory retired

17:34.621 --> 17:36.320
two weeks earlier.

17:36.322 --> 17:39.690
He was retired,
but he worked two weeks later?

17:39.692 --> 17:42.627
Maybe he loved working
at the property clerk.

17:42.629 --> 17:45.630
Yeah, he loved it so much,
he couldn't leave.

17:45.632 --> 17:48.566
Let's get an address.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.773
Think he'll talk to us?

17:55.775 --> 17:59.744
Yeah. Maybe he'll tell us
how he affords this house.

18:01.481 --> 18:02.647
(<i> knock at door</i> )

18:05.518 --> 18:06.818
Al McCrory?

18:06.820 --> 18:07.718
Yeah.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.353
Sergeant Greevey.

18:09.355 --> 18:11.289
Detective Logan.

18:11.291 --> 18:13.691
Do I know you fellas?
We ever worked together?

18:13.693 --> 18:15.560
No. We just want to ask you:

18:15.562 --> 18:16.794
When you were
going to retire,

18:16.796 --> 18:18.663
you worked
the property clerk's office

18:18.665 --> 18:19.831
an extra couple of days.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.466
What's this about?

18:21.468 --> 18:22.633
Well, there's
a discrepancy.

18:22.635 --> 18:25.570
It says you were retired
but still working.

18:25.572 --> 18:27.572
Some problem with my pension?

18:27.574 --> 18:29.507
Wait a minute.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.943
You guys work for Cragen?

18:31.944 --> 18:34.378
What am I wearing, a sign
on my forehead says stupid?

18:34.380 --> 18:36.514
Your captain's in trouble,
don't come to me.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.149
Wait a minute.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.783
You touch me,
I'll have you up for assault.

18:39.786 --> 18:43.621
I think you'd better get out
of my house and out of my yard.

18:47.594 --> 18:50.128
Now, there's a guy
with nothing to hide.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.687
Max.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.724
What a nice surprise.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.726
We never see you anymore.

19:21.728 --> 19:23.694
How's Marie?
How are the kids?

19:23.696 --> 19:25.163
Fine. Everybody's good.

19:25.165 --> 19:27.165
Good. Ah, you're lucky.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.766
You don't have to drink
his coffee today.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.601
It's already made.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.738
I've got an 8:00 flight,
so give my best to Marie.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.873
Sure.
Okay. Thanks, honey.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.508
Bye-bye.

19:37.510 --> 19:38.576
Bye.

19:41.648 --> 19:43.881
Just happen to be
in the neighborhood?

19:43.883 --> 19:45.516
No.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.518
You want to come in?

19:47.520 --> 19:48.886
Putting in a pool?

19:48.888 --> 19:50.621
Yeah.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.590
Oh.

19:59.399 --> 20:01.699
You know a cop
named Al McCrory?

20:06.539 --> 20:08.773
Property clerk's
duty roster

20:08.775 --> 20:10.875
says he worked the same days
you were there.

20:10.877 --> 20:16.781
Master roll call says
he retired two weeks earlier.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.516
Friend of yours?

20:18.518 --> 20:20.551
He used to drive
for the chief a oouple years.

20:20.553 --> 20:21.652
You know him?

20:21.654 --> 20:23.421
Just to say hello.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.656
And you haven't seen him
in years?

20:25.658 --> 20:26.757
That's right.

20:26.759 --> 20:28.893
But you know him,
O'Farrell knows him,

20:28.895 --> 20:30.761
and he worked
after he retired.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.698
You think you'll come in
for a few days
after you retire?

20:33.700 --> 20:34.999
So McCrory knows the chief.

20:35.001 --> 20:36.634
Does that make him guilty?

20:36.636 --> 20:38.769
Any more than my being there
makes me guilty?

20:38.771 --> 20:41.839
McCrory, we saw him.
He knew who we were.

20:41.841 --> 20:44.475
Somehow, put our names together
with yours.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.713
Forget about him
for a second.

20:48.715 --> 20:50.781
What about Chief O'Farrell?

20:50.783 --> 20:53.784
You just don't like
politicians, Max. Never did.

20:53.786 --> 20:54.919
Not when they're crooked,

20:54.921 --> 20:56.554
and especially not when they try

20:56.556 --> 20:57.722
to bring my friends down
with them.

20:57.724 --> 21:01.525
I had nothing to do with it,

21:01.527 --> 21:03.661
and I'm sure
Pete O'Farrell didn't, either.

21:03.663 --> 21:06.631
Oh, that's great.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.601
Donny, what are you doing?

21:10.603 --> 21:12.653
See no evil, hear no evil?

21:12.654 --> 21:14.704
How could you even think that
I would tamper with evidence?

21:14.707 --> 21:18.476
I don't,
but something isn't kosher!

21:18.478 --> 21:19.978
I don't know what it is,

21:19.979 --> 21:21.479
and I sure as hell hope
you don't know, either!

21:26.819 --> 21:29.020
You do me a favor, huh, Max?

21:29.022 --> 21:32.290
Forget I ever asked you
to help me.

21:36.696 --> 21:39.964
You'd better run yourself
a little reality check.

21:39.966 --> 21:44.702
The sharks are out,
and there's blood in the water.

22:03.589 --> 22:04.722
The property clerk.

22:04.724 --> 22:07.558
It's off-limits to you.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.727
Just keep out
of this investigation.

22:09.729 --> 22:11.696
What are you pulling,
good cop, bad cop on me?

22:11.698 --> 22:12.930
Like I'm some kind of a perp?

22:12.932 --> 22:14.832
For all I know, you are.

22:14.834 --> 22:17.101
Hey, you listen to me.
No, you listen to me!

22:17.103 --> 22:19.837
You and Greevey
keep your noses out of this!

22:19.839 --> 22:21.806
You talk to one more cop--
one more--

22:21.808 --> 22:23.074
and don't think reprimand.

22:23.076 --> 22:24.775
It's going to be a hearing
for a suspension.

22:24.777 --> 22:26.043
It's better for
you, really.

22:26.045 --> 22:28.045
You stay away from
the property clerk,

22:28.047 --> 22:30.514
from the computer people,
from Buscalera,

22:30.516 --> 22:32.016
from the F.E.C.
and from Chief O'Farrell.

22:32.018 --> 22:37.088
Am I making myself clear?

22:43.763 --> 22:46.564
LOGAN:
Listen, the I.A.D.
mentioned the F.E.C.

22:46.566 --> 22:47.832
What's the deal?

22:47.834 --> 22:49.834
Federal Elections
Commission.

22:49.836 --> 22:51.936
What's that got to do
with an I.A.D. case?

22:51.938 --> 22:52.937
Oh, no.

22:52.939 --> 22:53.938
What?

22:53.940 --> 22:55.573
Billy Wilson.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.841
My congressman?

22:56.843 --> 22:58.843
You're 15 years too
young to remember.

22:58.845 --> 23:01.879
Before he was a congressman,
Billy Wilson was a cop.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.764
And?

23:03.765 --> 23:05.648
What have we been
missing? Motive.

23:05.651 --> 23:07.752
Why would anybody
help those bankers?

23:07.754 --> 23:09.019
I'm waiting, Max.

23:09.021 --> 23:11.655
Chief O'Farrell
was Billy Wilson's

23:11.657 --> 23:12.890
handpicked successor.

23:12.892 --> 23:15.893
Who would O'Farrell
do a favor for?

23:15.895 --> 23:17.395
Give me some quarters.

23:17.397 --> 23:20.398
This isn't a call
to make inside the precinct.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.666
The House Banking Committee.

23:22.668 --> 23:24.802
Billy Wilson's been there
since he was elected.

23:24.804 --> 23:26.837
Those three bankers
that got off,

23:26.839 --> 23:28.773
they gave his campaign
a lot of money.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.941
The legal limit. At least
that's all that's on the books.

23:30.943 --> 23:32.843
You give money
to your congressman,

23:32.845 --> 23:34.044
it's automatically payoff?

23:34.046 --> 23:36.180
Gee, I thought
this was a democracy.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.182
Look, O'Farrell was your rabbi

23:38.184 --> 23:40.684
the same way
that Wilson was O'Farrell's.

23:40.686 --> 23:42.820
You need a motive for him
to tamper with evidence,

23:42.822 --> 23:43.921
I think you've got one.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.690
I said help me out.

23:46.692 --> 23:48.959
Did I ask you to nail
Pete O'Farrell?

23:48.961 --> 23:52.797
I think
you're taking loyalty too far.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.732
O'Farrell is no more corrupt
than you are.

23:54.734 --> 23:56.167
You think that, you're going
to go down with him.

23:56.169 --> 23:57.835
Is that right, Max?

23:57.837 --> 23:58.836
I'm going down?

23:58.838 --> 24:00.104
For what?

24:03.643 --> 24:06.744
You guys got a trial coming up?

24:06.746 --> 24:08.646
Boorman case?

24:08.648 --> 24:10.815
Why don't you get to work.

24:23.830 --> 24:25.830
You think this doesn't play?

24:25.832 --> 24:28.132
If I were
conducting an orchestra,

24:28.134 --> 24:30.000
I'd say the violins
were missing.

24:30.002 --> 24:32.903
Oh, come on.
The congressman
is the conductor.

24:32.905 --> 24:35.139
The bankers called
Congressman Wilson.

24:35.141 --> 24:38.075
They've been paying his bills
ever since he got elected.

24:38.077 --> 24:40.244
My guess, the contributions

24:40.246 --> 24:42.646
go way beyond federal
campaign limits.

24:42.648 --> 24:44.648
And now they
want a payback.

24:44.650 --> 24:46.116
"Fix this evidence,
Congressman

24:46.118 --> 24:48.752
or you're going
down with us."

24:48.754 --> 24:51.889
One: the congressman's
behind this.

24:51.891 --> 24:53.891
Can't prove it.

24:53.893 --> 24:58.195
Two: nothing concrete ties
Chief O'Farrell or Cragen.

24:58.197 --> 25:00.764
Just a minute.
Just a minute.

25:00.766 --> 25:01.899
Three: the disks.

25:01.901 --> 25:04.134
We have no idea
who altered them.

25:04.136 --> 25:06.136
We asked O'Farrell
to conduct an investigation.

25:06.138 --> 25:08.839
He took his
own sweet time.

25:08.841 --> 25:10.908
We have six detectives
who are willing to testify

25:10.910 --> 25:12.877
that he went slow.

25:12.878 --> 25:14.845
Slow, fast, I don't care
if he was building a clock.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.848
Without physical evidence,
the testimony's meaningless.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.084
He's chief of Operations.

25:20.086 --> 25:23.053
Cragen, a career officer
with an unblemished record.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.523
We need a clear-cut motive.

25:25.525 --> 25:27.791
(<i> sighs</i> )

25:27.793 --> 25:29.376
You know how badly
I want this case.

25:29.377 --> 25:30.960
They tampered with evidence.
The bankers walk.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.796
But I can't move on supposition.

25:32.798 --> 25:33.831
It's easy.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.299
It's conspiracy.

25:35.301 --> 25:38.536
The last time conspiracy
was easy to prove

25:38.538 --> 25:40.704
was Judas and the Romans.

25:40.706 --> 25:41.939
Thank you, gentlemen.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.245
We lose this one
after the bankers,

25:48.247 --> 25:50.080
we look like idiots.

25:50.082 --> 25:52.182
I.A.D. doesn't
have enough.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.952
SCHIFF:
O'Farrell
survives this,

25:54.954 --> 25:58.956
any cop that talks to us
is finished.

25:58.958 --> 26:00.758
As for Congressman Wilson...

26:00.760 --> 26:03.928
he makes ABSCAM look like
"Hello, Dolly."

26:03.930 --> 26:06.130
Investigated for campaign fraud
a dozen times.

26:06.132 --> 26:09.833
Draw the pyramid,
or you get no conviction.

26:09.835 --> 26:14.972
Congressman Wilson,
Chief O'Farrell, Captain Cragen.

26:14.974 --> 26:18.976
Yank a piece out,
pyramid falls... maybe.

26:23.950 --> 26:26.984
We appreciate your
coming over, Mr. Stone.

26:26.986 --> 26:29.253
Anything to avoid
embarrassing the congressman.

26:29.255 --> 26:31.855
You're besmirching
my reputation.

26:31.857 --> 26:36.293
Oh, I think you're giving me
a lot of help there, sir.

26:36.295 --> 26:38.262
And what will the jury think?

26:38.264 --> 26:41.865
Chief O'Farrell
owes you his job.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.817
Those bankers

26:43.818 --> 26:45.768
gave you more than $100,000
in campaign contribution.

26:45.771 --> 26:46.937
You know
what that's called?

26:46.939 --> 26:50.007
The greatness
of American politics.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.276
No, sir, it's called a road map,

26:52.278 --> 26:56.146
and I think a jury can find
its way from A to B.

26:56.148 --> 26:59.116
If you're convicted, you lose
your congressional seat

26:59.118 --> 27:01.318
and your pension.

27:01.320 --> 27:03.954
If you resign first
and then plead...

27:03.956 --> 27:06.857
Let's suppose

27:06.859 --> 27:09.893
and we're only
just supposing here.

27:09.895 --> 27:12.830
The congressman mentioned
his constituents' problem

27:12.832 --> 27:14.365
to Chief O'Farrell.

27:14.367 --> 27:17.935
Without suggesting
anything be done,

27:17.937 --> 27:20.904
we'll plead to
rewarding official misconduct,

27:20.906 --> 27:22.106
second degree.

27:22.108 --> 27:24.908
Consider bribery three.

27:24.910 --> 27:28.312
You think I'd plead
to a "D" felony?

27:28.314 --> 27:29.980
That's our offer.

27:29.982 --> 27:33.117
Consider it rejected.

27:53.939 --> 27:54.938
Paul.

27:54.940 --> 27:56.407
Max.

27:56.409 --> 27:59.109
We ordered them
to stay out of this.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.878
It's on our days off.
It's our time.

28:00.880 --> 28:01.879
I warned you.

28:01.881 --> 28:04.348
Lieutenant Kennedy,
sit down.

28:04.350 --> 28:08.052
Department's time or yours,
it's an I.A.D. Investigation.

28:08.054 --> 28:09.887
If you can call it
investigating.
Max

28:09.889 --> 28:10.988
I'm going to have you up

28:10.990 --> 28:12.389
on departmental charges, friend.

28:12.391 --> 28:14.408
Back off, Kennedy.

28:14.409 --> 28:16.426
The only departmental charge
here is gross incompetence.

28:16.429 --> 28:18.962
Gentlemen, please.

28:18.964 --> 28:20.130
Sit down.

28:21.901 --> 28:25.202
Have you got anything specific?

28:26.305 --> 28:29.106
Cop named McCrory, retired.

28:29.108 --> 28:31.108
Who worked
the property clerk's office

28:31.110 --> 28:32.342
<i>after</i> he retired.

28:32.344 --> 28:33.444
Wrong.

28:33.446 --> 28:35.112
We have the master roll call.

28:35.114 --> 28:37.414
You know why
cops hate I.A.D.?

28:37.416 --> 28:40.150
Because you idiots couldn't
convict a ten-year-old

28:40.152 --> 28:43.187
of selling
watered-down lemonade.

28:43.189 --> 28:45.122
Mccrory's on
the duty roster,

28:45.124 --> 28:49.093
which you
forgot to copy.

28:50.029 --> 28:53.163
Is that important?

28:53.165 --> 28:57.000
The master roll call
is made up at headquarters.

28:57.002 --> 29:01.004
It shows everybody
that's supposed to be working.

29:01.006 --> 29:04.007
Mccrory's not on it.

29:04.009 --> 29:07.077
LOGAN:
The duty roster is a record
of everybody who was there.

29:07.079 --> 29:12.082
That's the one McCrory was on
two weeks after he retired.

29:12.084 --> 29:15.519
LOGAN:
And his house looks like
it cost six times my salary.

29:15.521 --> 29:19.022
Mortgage on McCrory's house
a point and a half below market.

29:19.024 --> 29:20.023
Sounds like a good deal.

29:20.025 --> 29:21.925
Real estate agent
says McCrory

29:21.927 --> 29:23.093
got a $300,000 house

29:23.095 --> 29:25.028
for 40 cents on the dollar.

29:25.030 --> 29:26.263
Sounds like a better deal.

29:26.265 --> 29:29.199
Previous owner: Parker, Evelyn.

29:29.201 --> 29:30.968
Her maiden name;
married to a congressman.

29:30.970 --> 29:32.336
Congressman named Wilson.

29:32.338 --> 29:36.173
And that's not a good deal,
that's a bribe.

29:41.981 --> 29:44.115
BAILIFF:
Albert McCrory.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.250
The charges are bribe receiving
in the second degree.

29:46.252 --> 29:48.218
Conspiracy
in the third degree

29:48.220 --> 29:49.987
and tampering
with physical evidence.

29:49.989 --> 29:52.022
How does
the defendant plead?

29:52.024 --> 29:53.357
Not guilty.

29:53.359 --> 29:54.525
BAILIFF:
Peter O'Farrell

29:54.527 --> 29:56.460
and the honorable
William Wilson.

29:56.462 --> 30:00.063
Charges of bribery
in the second degree,

30:00.065 --> 30:02.332
conspiracy in the third degree.

30:02.334 --> 30:04.501
How do the defendants plead?

30:04.503 --> 30:06.103
Congressman Wilson?

30:06.105 --> 30:08.038
Not guilty, Your Honor.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.139
Chief O'Farrell?

30:09.141 --> 30:10.207
Not guilty.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.242
Your Honor, as lead counsel,

30:12.244 --> 30:15.212
we ask the defendants
be released R.O.R.

30:15.214 --> 30:17.347
Mr. Robinette?

30:17.349 --> 30:21.051
Your Honor, this is a case
about obstruction of justice

30:21.053 --> 30:25.189
and public officials selling
the benefit of their office.

30:25.191 --> 30:27.324
The people feel
bail is essential.

30:27.326 --> 30:30.093
Your Honor,
the district attorney's record

30:30.095 --> 30:31.495
on white-collar criminal charges

30:31.497 --> 30:34.398
does not make one sanguine
about their motives.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.501
Interesting, Mr. Quinn.

30:37.503 --> 30:39.503
But I don't recall

30:39.505 --> 30:44.041
a section in the C.P.L.
on prosecutorial motive.

30:44.043 --> 30:47.144
Bail is set at $50,000 each.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.112
Taking a bribe,
evidence tampering.

30:49.114 --> 30:51.348
We're not talking
hand in the cookie jar.

30:51.350 --> 30:53.617
Don't be foolish.
You were a pawn.

30:53.619 --> 30:57.120
That house put you
at the heart of this conspiracy.

30:57.122 --> 30:58.555
Soft market.

30:58.557 --> 31:00.290
I got a good deal.

31:00.292 --> 31:02.025
Here's a better deal.

31:02.027 --> 31:04.394
Four to 15 years
if you don't testify.

31:04.396 --> 31:06.263
You think you can convict?

31:06.265 --> 31:07.598
Where's the conspiracy?

31:07.600 --> 31:09.867
Your client worked
the property clerk's office

31:09.869 --> 31:11.235
after he retired.

31:11.237 --> 31:13.370
The jury is going
to wonder why.

31:13.372 --> 31:17.040
A jury needs a clear line from
that to the tampered evidence.

31:17.042 --> 31:18.592
You haven't got it.

31:18.593 --> 31:20.143
When we do,
we won't be making any deals.

31:20.145 --> 31:21.578
You're taking this personally.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.146
You bet I am.

31:23.148 --> 31:25.148
You know it's impossible
to get a conviction

31:25.150 --> 31:26.550
on a white collar criminal
<i> with</i> evidence.

31:26.552 --> 31:29.186
What he did
was worse than a crime.

31:29.188 --> 31:30.520
Your client
doesn't cooperate?

31:30.522 --> 31:32.356
I'm taking him
down, too.

31:34.426 --> 31:36.360
Criminal facilitation.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.428
He does no time.

31:38.430 --> 31:40.464
This case, everybody does time.

31:40.466 --> 31:43.166
Bribe receiving, third degree,
does 18 months.

31:43.168 --> 31:46.303
He does zero months
after he's acquitted.

31:46.305 --> 31:50.274
McCrory is not
a computer expert.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.608
Neither is Cragen.

31:51.610 --> 31:53.243
How hard is it?

31:53.245 --> 31:56.146
Cragen could have
done it in the precinct.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.448
Yeah, that computer guy at
Forensic says a 12-year-old

31:58.450 --> 32:00.284
could have changed
those disks.

32:00.286 --> 32:01.551
ROBINETTE:
Hold on.

32:01.553 --> 32:04.621
Shearer, the one who
went to Bermuda.

32:04.623 --> 32:06.290
Yeah. What about him?

32:06.292 --> 32:08.625
Why didn't he
do the trial work

32:08.627 --> 32:10.928
before he went
on his honeymoon?

32:10.930 --> 32:13.230
They got to him,
offered him a bribe.

32:13.232 --> 32:15.098
Are you crazy?

32:15.100 --> 32:19.202
Shearer was the one who told us
how the disks were changed.

32:19.204 --> 32:20.203
Right.

32:20.205 --> 32:21.939
Ever hear about the art expert?

32:21.941 --> 32:24.225
Forged a matisse.

32:24.226 --> 32:26.510
The museum hireshim
to see if it's a forgery.

32:26.512 --> 32:28.145
'Coures he says
it's a matisse.

32:28.147 --> 32:30.213
He authenticates
his own forgery.

32:30.215 --> 32:33.283
Shearer takes the disks,
changes them,

32:33.285 --> 32:37.154
tells I.A.D. how it's done,
looks like a hero.

32:38.157 --> 32:39.957
STONE:
Paul...

32:39.959 --> 32:43.126
find out what time
Shearer's plane landed here.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.528
The exact hour.

32:44.530 --> 32:48.231
And see if McCrory was at
the property clerk's office

32:48.233 --> 32:49.666
at the same time.

32:49.668 --> 32:52.636
Internal Affairs cleared
Detective Shearer.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.371
STONE:
Cleared?

32:54.373 --> 32:56.573
I.A.D. never suspected
Detective Shearer.

32:56.575 --> 33:00.177
When did he get back
from the honeymoon, Paul?

33:00.179 --> 33:01.979
Plane lands 2:45.

33:01.981 --> 33:04.681
Doorman says
Detective Shearer
and his wife

33:04.683 --> 33:06.183
got home at 4:00.

33:06.185 --> 33:08.418
He went upstairs,
dropped his bags,

33:08.420 --> 33:09.753
left again
ten minutes later.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.588
To get the dry cleaning.

33:11.590 --> 33:13.323
STONE:
After your honeymoon?

33:13.325 --> 33:14.725
That's very romantic.

33:14.727 --> 33:16.393
Paul.

33:16.395 --> 33:17.627
According to the doorman,

33:17.629 --> 33:20.163
Detective Shearer
was gone for three hours.

33:20.165 --> 33:22.399
Your dry cleaner
in Philadelphia?

33:22.401 --> 33:24.668
You're riding
the wrong horse.

33:24.670 --> 33:27.221
Do you know what happens

33:27.222 --> 33:29.773
when someone pleads
in the middle of a trial
like Officer McCrory?

33:29.775 --> 33:33.210
I'll take a deal from anyone
to get your client.

33:33.212 --> 33:36.580
You know, Stone,
you're wasting your talents.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.615
You don't write indictments.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.650
You write fairy tales.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.486
Let's get out of here.

33:48.527 --> 33:51.261
You really think McCrory
will make a deal?

33:51.263 --> 33:52.662
Not a prayer,

33:52.664 --> 33:54.464
but Shearer
doesn't know that.

33:54.466 --> 33:56.666
The tap in place?

33:56.668 --> 34:00.037
We'll see who he calls.

34:00.039 --> 34:01.438
Is Cragen involved?

34:01.440 --> 34:04.274
I don't want to indict him
if I'm not sure.

34:04.276 --> 34:06.743
What if we feed him
part of the picture?

34:06.745 --> 34:08.478
McCrory getting
his house on the cheap.

34:08.480 --> 34:09.746
See how he reacts.

34:09.748 --> 34:12.549
If he's in
on the conspiracy,

34:12.551 --> 34:14.818
anything you say
goes directly to O'Farrell.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.454
Give away your case
before you get to court.

34:17.456 --> 34:18.522
It's a gamble.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.290
So is the lottery.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.758
(<i> intercom buzzing</i> )

34:24.463 --> 34:25.595
Yeah?

34:25.597 --> 34:27.464
Thanks.

34:27.466 --> 34:30.333
Cragen.

34:32.771 --> 34:35.739
Like we told you,
we have nothing for you.

34:35.741 --> 34:38.742
You still want to be
a sacrificial lamb?

34:38.744 --> 34:41.344
What do you want?

34:41.346 --> 34:42.612
SCHIFF:
We need O'Farrell.

34:42.614 --> 34:44.247
STONE:
If you're not
part of this,

34:44.249 --> 34:45.682
wear a wire on the chief.

34:45.684 --> 34:48.552
And no cop ever trusts me again.

34:48.554 --> 34:50.787
No crooked cop
ever trusts you again.

34:50.789 --> 34:54.658
We're talking about a cop who's
involved in evidence tampering

34:54.660 --> 34:55.859
in a felony
investigation.

34:55.861 --> 34:56.860
That's a felony.

34:56.862 --> 34:59.296
I don't want to indict you.

35:00.532 --> 35:02.866
My God.

35:06.638 --> 35:08.572
Well, that house had been empty

35:08.574 --> 35:11.108
for...15, 16 months.

35:11.110 --> 35:14.111
The house wasn't on the market.
Do you know why?

35:14.113 --> 35:15.879
What, these days?

35:15.881 --> 35:18.348
Some people don't even try.

35:18.350 --> 35:20.383
When did it go on the market?

35:20.385 --> 35:24.621
Well, out of the blue,
one afternoon, she calls me--

35:24.623 --> 35:26.523
the congressman's wife,
Mrs. Wilson--

35:26.525 --> 35:28.525
and she says,
"Try to sell it."

35:28.527 --> 35:31.661
So, I put a sign
in the yard

35:31.663 --> 35:33.663
and an ad in the county paper.

35:33.665 --> 35:37.534
And when did Albert McCrory
make an offer on the house?

35:37.536 --> 35:39.836
Oh, now I don't remember
exactly when...

35:39.838 --> 35:41.872
Two, three days later.

35:41.874 --> 35:45.142
And did he say how he knew
the house was available?

35:45.144 --> 35:47.477
He was driving by
in his car.

35:47.479 --> 35:48.645
Saw the sign.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.814
What did you tell
the congressman's wife

35:50.816 --> 35:52.816
when the offer was made?

35:52.818 --> 35:56.920
Well, I am not like some agents.

35:56.922 --> 36:02.492
I don't hold back offers,
but I said, "This is crazy."

36:02.494 --> 36:05.862
He is offering you
half of what it's worth.

36:05.864 --> 36:07.764
Did she agree with you?

36:07.766 --> 36:09.366
Well, she said, "Sell it."

36:09.368 --> 36:10.934
Very firm.

36:10.936 --> 36:14.771
Didn't want any argument.
Just sell it.

36:18.510 --> 36:19.910
You're reading the jury?

36:19.912 --> 36:22.612
They don't like people
who buy houses at half price.

36:22.614 --> 36:25.615
Mr. Stone last night's tape
from the Shearer tap?

36:25.617 --> 36:27.450
You're going to want
to hear it.

36:27.452 --> 36:29.719
SHEARER:
They say you're going
to make a deal.

36:29.721 --> 36:31.922
McCRORY:
I don't know you.
Good-bye.

36:31.924 --> 36:33.857
SHEARER:
Don't leave me
swinging in the wind.

36:33.859 --> 36:35.959
McCRORY:
You stupid,
get off the damn phone.

36:35.961 --> 36:37.827
SHEARER:
This was<i> your</i> idea.

36:37.829 --> 36:39.629
(<i> dial tone</i> )

36:39.630 --> 36:41.430
SHEARER:
Don't hang up on me...
(<i> click</i> )

36:42.901 --> 36:44.868
Why did you do it?

36:44.870 --> 36:50.373
You needed money
for the honeymoon?

36:50.375 --> 36:52.542
Behind in
the credit cards?

36:52.544 --> 36:54.377
That tape proves nothing.

36:54.379 --> 36:56.613
STONE:
Sounds like
a confession to me.

36:56.615 --> 36:59.749
You're finished as a cop.

36:59.751 --> 37:02.485
The only question is,
do you want to work on computers

37:02.487 --> 37:07.524
or do you want to make
license plates?

37:07.526 --> 37:10.594
Bribery receiving
third degree,

37:10.596 --> 37:11.995
full restitution.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.964
We recommend probation.

37:17.536 --> 37:20.537
I don't want to go to jail.

37:20.539 --> 37:22.806
And when did Al McCrory
approach you?

37:22.808 --> 37:25.542
SHEARER:
The day after
I took the disks

37:25.544 --> 37:26.810
from the bank.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.812
Did he offer you a bribe?

37:28.814 --> 37:30.814
He asked me what I wanted.

37:30.816 --> 37:33.750
There's some judge
I read in the paper.

37:33.752 --> 37:35.518
He fixed a case for 20 grand.

37:35.520 --> 37:38.255
I figure I'm worth 20 grand,
too. He agreed.

37:38.257 --> 37:42.525
When you returned from
your honeymoon, what did you do?

37:42.527 --> 37:45.929
I got in a cab, went down
to the property clerk,

37:45.931 --> 37:48.832
called McCrory from a pay phone.

37:48.834 --> 37:51.735
He came out in a couple minutes
with the disks.

37:51.737 --> 37:53.536
And then what did you do?

37:53.538 --> 37:57.674
Uh, went to Computer Heaven--
16th street.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.943
Used their display model,
my own utility disks,

37:59.945 --> 38:02.045
wiped a few tracks clean.

38:02.047 --> 38:05.649
When you first brought the
evidence to the property clerk,

38:05.651 --> 38:07.917
Officer McCrory
wasn't working there, was he?

38:07.919 --> 38:08.952
No.

38:08.954 --> 38:10.954
And no one outside that office

38:10.956 --> 38:13.690
knew that you were working
on this case?

38:13.692 --> 38:14.924
No.

38:14.926 --> 38:18.528
So how did Al McCrory
find his way to you?

38:18.530 --> 38:20.530
I don't know.

38:20.532 --> 38:21.931
Somebody must have told him,
right?

38:21.933 --> 38:22.766
Objection.

38:22.768 --> 38:23.967
Withdrawn.

38:23.969 --> 38:25.502
No further questions.

38:27.572 --> 38:32.309
Detective Shearer,
in a conspiracy,

38:32.311 --> 38:38.315
people engage in illegal
activity with other people.

38:38.317 --> 38:39.983
So, let me ask you.

38:39.985 --> 38:42.018
Have you ever met
Peter O'Farrell?

38:42.020 --> 38:44.087
No...

38:44.089 --> 38:45.655
but Al McCrory used to...

38:45.657 --> 38:46.990
Yes or no, please.

38:46.992 --> 38:50.727
Have you ever met
Congressman William Wilson?

38:50.729 --> 38:51.761
No.

38:51.763 --> 38:53.997
Never talked
to either one of them

38:53.999 --> 38:55.565
on the phone, did you?

38:55.567 --> 38:57.100
No.

38:57.102 --> 38:58.735
Thank you.

38:58.737 --> 39:01.604
No further questions.

39:01.606 --> 39:03.673
Mccrory's going down,
no question there.

39:03.675 --> 39:05.709
The congressman?

39:05.711 --> 39:08.044
When the jury
looks at the bankers'
campaign contributions,

39:08.046 --> 39:09.512
they'll make the connection.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.648
O'Farrell's still
out of the game.

39:11.650 --> 39:14.050
The jury hasn't
seem him in a huddle,

39:14.052 --> 39:15.785
let alone calling a play.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.520
But the chief
was Wilson's protege.

39:17.522 --> 39:19.889
The jury can make
that leap of faith.

39:19.891 --> 39:20.890
Yeah, well, I wouldn't,

39:20.892 --> 39:23.860
and if I wouldn't,
they won't.

39:23.862 --> 39:26.930
O'Farrell's a better politician
than I am.

39:26.932 --> 39:29.933
If he wasn't a cop,
he'd be president.

39:29.935 --> 39:31.634
Indict Cragen.

39:31.636 --> 39:32.936
You don't mean that?

39:32.938 --> 39:34.904
Don't I?

39:34.906 --> 39:37.974
As a Catholic, you know
that sins of omission

39:37.976 --> 39:41.044
are just as bad
as sins of commission.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.645
He knows something.

39:42.647 --> 39:43.947
I don't think so.

39:43.949 --> 39:45.648
He looks guilty.

39:45.650 --> 39:48.051
Shake the tree,
see what falls out.

39:48.053 --> 39:49.686
Come on!

39:49.688 --> 39:50.954
That's blackmail, Stone.

39:50.956 --> 39:52.956
That's one word for it.

39:52.958 --> 39:56.059
a bill of indictment.
The grand jury calls it

39:56.061 --> 39:58.928
He's been my friend
for 20 years.

39:58.930 --> 40:00.663
Suppose the chief
is innocent.

40:00.665 --> 40:02.399
You're going to the ceremony.
Wear a wire.

40:02.401 --> 40:03.733
Prove us wrong.

40:15.947 --> 40:18.148
Cheer up!
You looked like
your dog died.

40:18.150 --> 40:21.651
It's hard to be cheerful
when the D.A.'S on your ass.

40:21.653 --> 40:23.753
Hey, Larry, how you doing?

40:23.755 --> 40:26.890
Look at this.
I can't even wear my uniform.

40:26.892 --> 40:28.825
I'm indicted.
I got to wear a suit.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.660
D.A. says I'm next.

40:30.662 --> 40:31.661
You?

40:31.663 --> 40:32.929
You didn't do anything.

40:32.931 --> 40:34.030
Stone says McCrory's scared.

40:34.032 --> 40:36.666
To buy himself a plea,
he'll name me.

40:36.668 --> 40:37.667
That's crap.

40:37.669 --> 40:38.902
Stone's jerking you around.

40:38.904 --> 40:40.036
Mccrory's a good cop.

40:40.038 --> 40:42.138
Who took a payoff
to do those disks.

40:42.140 --> 40:44.007
It looks that way,
doesn't it?

40:44.009 --> 40:46.109
Whatever happened, Don,
nobody touches you.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.745
Whatever happened?

40:48.747 --> 40:51.614
You mean this investigation
going slow. You?

40:51.616 --> 40:53.116
Me, I got nothing
to worry about.

40:53.118 --> 40:56.786
You do Billy Wilson
a favor?

40:59.124 --> 41:01.858
Don, you don't happen to
be wearing a wire, do you?

41:01.860 --> 41:03.827
Come on.
Why would I do that?

41:03.829 --> 41:05.028
I don't know.

41:05.030 --> 41:07.230
But you know I'd never
do anything to hurt you.

41:07.232 --> 41:10.967
Look, You did a favor
for Wilson, I understand.

41:10.969 --> 41:15.004
Billy I owe a lot,
but not my career.

41:15.006 --> 41:18.708
Look, none of us
walks on water.

41:18.710 --> 41:20.743
The way I've been
smelling lately,

41:20.745 --> 41:22.912
we shouldn't even be talking.

41:24.749 --> 41:28.017
I'll buy you dinner
after the trial, okay, kid?

41:28.019 --> 41:29.986
Got it.

41:34.659 --> 41:37.660
This mean I don't get indicted?

41:37.662 --> 41:39.128
You did your best.

41:39.130 --> 41:41.130
I had to push you.
I had no choice.

41:41.132 --> 41:43.867
It's not your fault, he didn't
say anything incriminating.

42:04.089 --> 42:07.090
Tomorrow, can you
put the word out

42:07.092 --> 42:09.893
that you're going to indict me?

42:12.697 --> 42:15.198
I'm going to get O'Farrell
for you.

42:15.200 --> 42:16.699
Wait a minute.
He didn't say...

42:16.701 --> 42:18.801
I know
what he said.

42:18.803 --> 42:22.238
But I looked in his eyes.

42:34.219 --> 42:36.085
So they indict you.

42:36.087 --> 42:38.922
It's not the end
of the world.

42:38.924 --> 42:40.089
No, getting convicted--

42:40.091 --> 42:42.959
that would be the end
of the world.

42:42.961 --> 42:45.028
Yeah.

42:45.029 --> 42:47.096
I.A.D. cleaned out
my office this morning,

42:47.098 --> 42:49.098
but not everything.

42:49.100 --> 42:52.302
Hey, they convict you,
I go down, too.

42:55.140 --> 42:58.141
So what didn't they get?

42:58.143 --> 42:59.242
A couple of memos.

42:59.244 --> 43:00.577
Originals, no copies.

43:00.579 --> 43:02.579
My detectives were complaining

43:02.581 --> 43:05.114
that your investigation
of the erased disks

43:05.116 --> 43:07.984
was going a little too slow
on purpose.

43:07.986 --> 43:11.120
They wanted to take it to I.A.D.
during the trial.

43:11.122 --> 43:13.957
And you took those memos home?

43:13.959 --> 43:17.193
I guess I could burn them.

43:19.130 --> 43:22.198
Even you.

43:24.803 --> 43:28.204
I always said
you were straight.

43:28.206 --> 43:31.207
Well, I got one foot
in bed with you already.

43:31.209 --> 43:32.275
That was loyalty.

43:32.277 --> 43:33.977
I'd like a little taste

43:33.979 --> 43:36.279
if I'm going to put
the other one under the covers.

43:36.281 --> 43:39.248
After all, I do have a swimming
pool to pay for.

43:41.152 --> 43:44.354
(<i> wry chuckle</i> )

43:47.158 --> 43:50.026
Yeah.

43:50.028 --> 43:53.896
20 grand we give
that computer cop.

43:53.898 --> 43:56.132
We would have
given him 200.

43:56.134 --> 44:00.036
Now, for these memos,
you want a piece, huh?

44:00.038 --> 44:01.170
Yeah.

44:01.172 --> 44:03.206
All right, me
and Billy Wilson

44:03.208 --> 44:05.041
split 300 grand.

44:05.043 --> 44:09.145
Now, three ways,
that's 100 apiece even.

44:09.147 --> 44:11.080
Is that fair?

44:11.082 --> 44:13.349
Oh, that's more than fair.

44:13.351 --> 44:15.852
Yeah.

44:17.288 --> 44:20.123
You're my best cop.

44:24.195 --> 44:26.929
I never would have figured.

44:38.209 --> 44:40.943
Ben Stone, please.

44:40.945 --> 44:43.346
Tell him it's Don Cragen.

44:43.348 --> 44:45.081
And during this conversation,

44:45.083 --> 44:47.083
did the defendant,
Peter O'Farrell

44:47.085 --> 44:49.085
admit to accepting a bribe?

44:49.087 --> 44:50.453
Objection. Hearsay.

Statement against interest,
Your Honor.

Overruled.

44:53.458 --> 44:55.124
Witness will answer.

44:55.126 --> 44:59.696
Chief O'Farrell told me
that he and Congressman Wilson

44:59.698 --> 45:02.699
received $300,000
from the three bankers

45:02.701 --> 45:04.233
to destroy evidence.

45:04.235 --> 45:07.370
And did Chief O'Farrell tell you
he had offered to bribe anyone?

45:07.372 --> 45:12.041
He said he told McCrory to pay
Detective Shearer $20,000.

45:12.043 --> 45:14.310
Did he offer you a bribe?

45:14.312 --> 45:18.214
$100,000 to destroy evidence.

45:18.216 --> 45:20.717
Thank you.
No further questions.

45:20.719 --> 45:23.453
No questions.

45:30.061 --> 45:34.130
Concerning defendant

45:34.132 --> 45:36.265
on the charge of bribe
receiving in the second degree,

45:36.267 --> 45:37.266
how does the jury find?

45:37.268 --> 45:39.318
Guilty.

45:39.319 --> 45:41.369
On the charge of conspiracy
in the third degree?

45:41.372 --> 45:43.389
Guilty.

45:43.390 --> 45:45.407

45:45.410 --> 45:47.043
Guilty.

45:47.045 --> 45:48.311
Concerning defendant

45:48.313 --> 45:50.179
William Wilson

45:50.181 --> 45:53.182
on the charge of bribery
in the second degree,

45:53.184 --> 45:54.951
how does the jury find?

45:54.953 --> 45:56.986
Guilty.

45:56.987 --> 45:59.020

46:00.125 --> 46:03.493
Concerning defendant
Peter O'Farrell

46:03.495 --> 46:06.162
on the charge of bribery

46:12.771 --> 46:16.372
Before this court adjourns,

46:16.374 --> 46:19.308
I want to note for the record
that I am appalled.

46:19.310 --> 46:21.344
We often say that
public officials

46:21.346 --> 46:25.148
are not above the law,
but that's not enough.

46:25.150 --> 46:26.415
They serve the law.

46:26.417 --> 46:28.017
If they don't respect it,

46:28.019 --> 46:29.786
who will?

46:29.788 --> 46:31.387
Court is adjourned.

46:31.389 --> 46:32.555
(<i> gavel falls</i> )

46:37.128 --> 46:40.797
WOMAN:
Mr. Cragen, could you
give us a statement please?

46:40.799 --> 46:43.332
MAN:
Any comments at all?

46:43.334 --> 46:47.336
O'Farrell was not a cop.

46:47.338 --> 46:49.806
He was always
a politician.

46:49.808 --> 46:53.209
Whatever you're feeling,
don't.

46:53.211 --> 46:55.344
The swimming pool, Max--

46:55.346 --> 46:58.481
you were wondering about it?

46:58.483 --> 46:58.514
Marge paid for it.
