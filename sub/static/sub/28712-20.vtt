00:01.827 --> 00:04.820
NARRATOR:
In 2019, a call went out

00:04.881 --> 00:07.067
to storm the gates
of the world's most top secret

00:07.091 --> 00:09.342
military installation.

00:09.502 --> 00:11.344
NICK POPE:
This was the place

00:11.504 --> 00:15.348
that people were attempting
to back engineer

00:15.508 --> 00:17.925
extraterrestrial technology.

00:18.019 --> 00:20.261
NARRATOR:
Millions responded.

00:20.355 --> 00:22.324
JEREMY CORBELL: This
information had been percolating

00:22.348 --> 00:26.025
for 30 years, and then bam!
A perfect storm.

00:26.185 --> 00:28.753
BILL BIRNES:
On the Internet, on the radio,

00:28.780 --> 00:32.180
promoters were talking
about let's storm Area 51.

00:32.241 --> 00:35.122
NARRATOR: The military
vowed to protect the base

00:35.194 --> 00:37.352
by any means necessary.

00:37.413 --> 00:38.704
The DoD said

00:38.864 --> 00:40.522
we would bomb millennials

00:40.583 --> 00:42.937
if they actually tried to storm
the gates of Area 51.

00:42.961 --> 00:46.194
NARRATOR: But still,
thousands met the call to action.

00:46.256 --> 00:49.031
What's behind those gates
is one of the last mysteries.

00:49.092 --> 00:52.777
I want the government to release
the records now, today.

00:52.804 --> 00:55.190
NARRATOR: Was this the
beginning of a movement

00:55.214 --> 00:58.707
that will finally tear down
the walls of government secrecy

00:58.768 --> 01:01.209
and expose the truth

01:01.271 --> 01:04.638
about an extraterrestrial
presence on planet Earth?

01:04.732 --> 01:07.233
GIORGIO A. TSOUKALOS:
People are interested

01:07.393 --> 01:08.462
in the extraterrestrial
question,

01:08.486 --> 01:10.653
and they want answers.

01:13.065 --> 01:15.223
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:15.285 --> 01:18.135
in the universe.

01:18.162 --> 01:20.955
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.809
It demands
we question everything

01:24.836 --> 01:27.144
we have ever been taught.

01:27.171 --> 01:31.332
The evidence is all around us.

01:31.426 --> 01:34.760
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:34.920 --> 01:37.504
We are not alone.

01:37.599 --> 01:40.933
We have never <i> been</i> alone.

01:55.608 --> 02:00.119
College student Matty Roberts
creates a post on Facebook.

02:00.279 --> 02:03.848
In it, Roberts calls on
his friends to storm

02:03.875 --> 02:05.644
the top secret
U.S. military base

02:05.668 --> 02:07.852
called Area 51,

02:07.879 --> 02:10.445
a place
that has long been rumored

02:10.506 --> 02:14.282
to be housing crashed
extraterrestrial spacecraft.

02:14.344 --> 02:17.544
As part of the post,
Roberts invites his readers

02:17.639 --> 02:21.623
to click to indicate
if they're attending.

02:21.684 --> 02:23.965
I had shared it to my own
personal Facebook page,

02:24.020 --> 02:26.979
and I think it amassed
probably about 40 RSVPs,

02:27.139 --> 02:28.555
the people that were interested

02:28.650 --> 02:30.610
or had tagged themselves
as going.

02:31.152 --> 02:33.560
NARRATOR:
Roberts has no idea

02:33.655 --> 02:35.971
whether the post
will simply reach his own circle

02:36.032 --> 02:38.157
of friends and acquaintances
on Facebook

02:38.317 --> 02:42.144
or if it will spread further
into cyberspace.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.497
He gets his answer
two days later

02:44.657 --> 02:48.559
when his phone begins buzzing
with RSVP notifications.

02:48.586 --> 02:50.836
First a few hundred.

02:50.996 --> 02:53.230
Then a few thousand.

02:53.257 --> 02:55.152
ROBERTS: It just kept
kind of snowballing.

02:55.176 --> 02:57.536
And it took about three days
for it to really take off,

02:57.670 --> 03:00.921
and it just took off
like wildfire.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.484
And then that's when
it got posted on reddit.

03:02.508 --> 03:03.869
And when it got posted
on reddit,

03:03.893 --> 03:05.075
it really took off.

03:05.103 --> 03:06.927
NARRATOR:
Within a week,

03:07.021 --> 03:11.173
the number of RSVPs soars
to over a million.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.026
And then on July 11,
the news got ahold of it.

03:14.186 --> 03:16.386
Now a new Facebook event
talks about organizing

03:16.522 --> 03:19.256
a large mob to raid the base.

03:19.283 --> 03:22.017
They were trying to organize
a big mob to storm Area 51,

03:22.078 --> 03:23.536
where all the aliens are.

03:23.696 --> 03:25.353
Officials are saying stay away,

03:25.415 --> 03:27.707
this is not something
you want to go to.

03:27.867 --> 03:30.729
REPORTER: There are even signs
that warn it's a restricted area,

03:30.753 --> 03:32.681
that it's unlawful to enter
the area without permission,

03:32.705 --> 03:36.048
and that use of deadly force
is authorized.

03:36.208 --> 03:38.108
In short, don't go.

03:38.136 --> 03:41.887
NARRATOR: News commentators point
out that if even a small fraction

03:42.047 --> 03:43.948
of those who responded show up,

03:43.975 --> 03:47.143
the proposed storming could
quickly turn violent.

03:50.273 --> 03:53.715
Alarmed at the overwhelming
response to Roberts' post,

03:53.776 --> 03:56.402
U.S. military officials
issue a warning.

03:56.562 --> 04:00.055
In ominous language,
it states that

04:00.116 --> 04:02.742
"The U.S. Air Force
always stands ready

04:02.902 --> 04:05.578
to protect America
and its assets."

04:05.738 --> 04:10.082
Within days, Matty Roberts
gets a visit from the FBI.

04:10.242 --> 04:12.476
ROBERTS:
FBI did show up to my house.

04:12.503 --> 04:14.648
They asked me to send them
anybody that's trying

04:14.672 --> 04:15.832
to radicalize this thing,

04:15.923 --> 04:18.089
in the form of actually
storming the base,

04:18.250 --> 04:20.060
and actually causing harm
to people.

04:20.084 --> 04:22.448
They were really concerned about
people sending me death threats.

04:22.472 --> 04:25.598
NARRATOR:
In the wake of the FBI's visit,

04:25.758 --> 04:28.993
Roberts claims that he was
joking all along,

04:29.020 --> 04:30.664
and that he never
actually intended

04:30.688 --> 04:33.421
for anyone to heed his call.

04:33.483 --> 04:35.794
ROBERTS: I was just kind of like,
I didn't think anybody was gonna

04:35.818 --> 04:37.921
take it too seriously 'cause
when I created the event

04:37.945 --> 04:39.945
on Facebook,
it was meant as a joke,

04:40.105 --> 04:41.385
kind of, like, tongue in cheek.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.489
Never intended for it
to go this far.

04:44.702 --> 04:47.011
It was terrifying.

04:47.038 --> 04:49.767
NARRATOR: But whether Roberts
wanted people to take him seriously

04:49.791 --> 04:53.684
or not, by early July,
it seemed nothing could derail

04:53.711 --> 04:55.711
what he had set in motion.

05:01.886 --> 05:05.546
Matty Roberts' original post
has now been reposted

05:05.640 --> 05:08.290
hundreds of thousands of times.

05:08.351 --> 05:11.385
Over two million people
have indicated

05:11.479 --> 05:14.480
they plan to descend
on Area 51 in September,

05:14.640 --> 05:17.465
and storm the top secret base.

05:17.527 --> 05:22.470
No one has any idea how many
might actually attend,

05:22.532 --> 05:25.491
and both the government and the
media gear up to blame Roberts

05:25.651 --> 05:28.385
if things turn into
an ugly confrontation

05:28.412 --> 05:33.666
between the military and tens of
thousands of UFO enthusiasts.

05:33.826 --> 05:37.002
In order to take the pressure
off of himself

05:37.162 --> 05:41.156
and his associates, Roberts asks
that his followers call off

05:41.217 --> 05:45.402
any plans to actually invade
the base on September 20.

05:45.429 --> 05:49.164
Instead, he announces
an alternative idea:

05:49.225 --> 05:52.242
a peaceful celebration
called Alienstock,

05:52.270 --> 05:56.413
which he begins organizing in
the tiny town of Rachel, Nevada,

05:56.440 --> 05:59.507
just outside Area 51.

05:59.569 --> 06:05.013
He promises a festival of music,
art and all things alien.

06:05.074 --> 06:08.092
POPE: In the weeks before the
event, there are efforts aimed

06:08.119 --> 06:12.872
at scaling down the rhetoric and
averting a potential tragedy.

06:13.032 --> 06:16.767
BIRNES: The government just did
a whole counter-media program,

06:16.794 --> 06:19.937
letting folks know that they're
not taking this as a game,

06:19.964 --> 06:22.214
they don't think it's funny.

06:22.374 --> 06:24.441
No, it's not Woodstock.

06:24.468 --> 06:27.202
You want to have a rock festival
outside of Rachel?

06:27.263 --> 06:29.204
Hey, have a nice day, right?

06:29.265 --> 06:33.133
But you cross Area 51,
we take it seriously.

06:33.227 --> 06:36.470
You will be arrested,
prosecuted,

06:36.564 --> 06:38.731
likely convicted
and sent to jail.

06:41.903 --> 06:45.295
NARRATOR: Ten days before
the event, two Dutch YouTubers

06:45.323 --> 06:47.981
penetrate the Area 51 perimeter,

06:48.075 --> 06:52.411
hiking three miles
into the restricted area.

06:52.571 --> 06:56.974
Their arrests make national
headlines, and add to concerns

06:57.001 --> 07:00.502
that the upcoming gathering
could easily get out of hand.

07:04.091 --> 07:08.135
POPE: Astoundingly,
they were sentenced to a year in jail.

07:10.598 --> 07:14.516
The message was clear: we are
going to come down on you hard.

07:23.936 --> 07:25.255
KEVIN ALMEIDA:
I think behind those gates

07:25.279 --> 07:27.521
is something that
nobody can explain,

07:27.615 --> 07:29.593
not even the people
that work there.

07:29.617 --> 07:31.261
I have no answers,
but I'm gonna find out.

07:31.285 --> 07:32.763
That's why I came here,
3,000 miles,

07:32.787 --> 07:34.361
to find out those answers.

07:34.455 --> 07:38.106
NARRATOR:
On the day the event begins,

07:38.167 --> 07:40.608
the Department of Defense posts
an ominous tweet.

07:40.670 --> 07:44.354
It features a picture
of a B-2 bomber,

07:44.382 --> 07:47.466
along with a heading that states
that this is the last thing

07:47.626 --> 07:51.712
millennials will see if they
attempt the Area 51 raid today.

07:51.806 --> 07:55.215
The tweet is quickly deleted.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.778
They made a case of saying
that it would be considered

07:56.802 --> 07:57.977
an act of terrorism.

07:58.137 --> 08:00.628
Even saying we would
bomb millennials

08:00.690 --> 08:03.540
if they actually tried to
storm the gates of Area 51.

08:03.567 --> 08:05.484
That was a little severe.

08:05.644 --> 08:09.804
POPE: Now, they cleverly didn't
exactly say what would happen,

08:09.865 --> 08:13.400
but there was a palpable threat
left hanging in the air.

08:13.494 --> 08:17.812
NARRATOR: Faced with the military's
willingness to defend Area 51

08:17.873 --> 08:22.501
at all costs, many potential
attendees change their plans

08:22.661 --> 08:25.746
and decide not to attend.

08:25.840 --> 08:28.340
But while the government
warnings are largely effective,

08:28.500 --> 08:31.010
on the night of September 20,

08:31.170 --> 08:34.571
nearly 100 people refuse
to be intimidated,

08:34.597 --> 08:35.847
and gather at the gates.

08:38.394 --> 08:41.520
ZACK ETKIND: I think behind the
gate there could very well be,

08:41.679 --> 08:44.414
uh, technology that
the government is not

08:44.442 --> 08:46.233
informing us of.

08:48.353 --> 08:50.507
There's a lot of people that
are, like, watching this event

08:50.531 --> 08:52.013
being like, "This is the night."

08:52.074 --> 08:53.760
This is the night
we find some aliens."

08:53.784 --> 08:55.016
They can't catch us all!

08:55.077 --> 08:58.428
(crowd shouting)

08:58.456 --> 09:01.101
KYLE KALLMAN: People are
prepared for a bloodbath,

09:01.125 --> 09:04.117
but I have seen nothing.

09:04.211 --> 09:05.856
The cops have been out
in a show of force,

09:05.880 --> 09:08.438
and they are gonna make it
very unpleasant

09:08.466 --> 09:11.216
for anybody who crosses.

09:11.376 --> 09:13.794
NARRATOR:
Both sides show restraint,

09:13.888 --> 09:17.038
and a potentially deadly
confrontation is averted.

09:17.099 --> 09:22.394
Only two people are detained by
authorities for minor offenses.

09:24.148 --> 09:28.292
Over the next three days,
approximately 3,000 more people

09:28.319 --> 09:32.220
make the journey to Area 51
in a show of solidarity,

09:32.281 --> 09:35.890
and in protest
of government secrecy.

09:35.951 --> 09:38.893
There's a huge alien community
around the world.

09:38.954 --> 09:42.730
It was a matter of time before
this was gonna happen.

09:42.792 --> 09:44.561
I don't think the government's
being honest,

09:44.585 --> 09:46.438
'cause I think they would
freak us out if they told us

09:46.462 --> 09:48.995
what was inside that big ol'
mountain there.

09:49.090 --> 09:52.444
NARRATOR: But there are many who
believe that without the serious threat

09:52.468 --> 09:55.319
of military action,
the turnout might have been

09:55.346 --> 09:57.745
significantly larger.

09:57.807 --> 10:01.916
MARTELL: The government
caused a lot of confusion,

10:01.977 --> 10:03.071
and pretty much discouraged
most people

10:03.095 --> 10:04.919
from showing up to the event.

10:04.980 --> 10:09.591
POPE: In the days and weeks
leading up to September the 20th,

10:09.652 --> 10:12.352
there was a mass
of confusing reports about

10:12.446 --> 10:14.947
what might actually take place.

10:15.107 --> 10:18.600
And one wonders, did this play
into the hands of the government

10:18.661 --> 10:20.694
and work to their advantage?

10:20.788 --> 10:24.939
NARRATOR: If government threats
did indeed suppress the turnout

10:25.000 --> 10:29.186
at the Area 51 festivals,
what could they be protecting?

10:29.213 --> 10:33.615
Is it only military secrets...
or something else?

10:33.676 --> 10:38.637
For ancient astronaut theorists,
the answer is obvious.

10:38.797 --> 10:42.307
So it seems a lot of people are
asking the same question:

10:42.467 --> 10:47.220
what is it that the government
is hiding at Area 51?

10:47.314 --> 10:49.450
LINDA MOULTON HOWE:
The United States began

10:49.474 --> 10:52.726
with a policy of lies
and denial.

10:52.820 --> 10:56.989
Let's call it for what it is...
counterintelligence.

10:57.149 --> 11:01.401
UFOs and ETs have been
at the top

11:01.495 --> 11:05.222
of the counterintelligence list
since World War II.

11:05.249 --> 11:08.000
Our government doesn't want us
to know the truth.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.577
TSOUKALOS:
We know for a fact

11:10.671 --> 11:14.173
that for over 50 years,
not just the U.S. government

11:14.333 --> 11:18.235
but governments from around
the world have always denied

11:18.262 --> 11:21.513
the UFO question or
the extraterrestrial question.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.871
NARRATOR: Could the U.S.
government be hiding

11:25.895 --> 11:32.024
not only crashed UFOs, but even
extraterrestrials at Area 51?

11:32.184 --> 11:34.842
Perhaps further clues
can be found

11:34.904 --> 11:37.437
at the very entrance
of the secret base,

11:37.531 --> 11:42.201
an entrance that has been
strictly off-limits for decades.

11:46.874 --> 11:49.099
NARRATOR:
Could Area 51 truly harbor

11:49.126 --> 11:51.210
extraterrestrial secrets?

11:51.370 --> 11:54.287
And if so, how did it all begin?

11:54.381 --> 11:56.531
Perhaps answers can be found

11:56.592 --> 12:00.368
in the murky history
of the mysterious desert base.

12:00.429 --> 12:04.798
We actually have to go back to
the attack on Pearl Harbor

12:04.892 --> 12:06.874
in December 1941.

12:06.936 --> 12:08.952
The government said

12:08.979 --> 12:12.547
we can never allow something
like this to happen again.

12:12.608 --> 12:16.977
So, let's move or create
some of these installations

12:17.071 --> 12:19.980
and facilities further
into the country.

12:20.074 --> 12:24.910
NARRATOR: Area 51 was built around
a salt flat known as Groom Lake.

12:25.070 --> 12:28.730
A runway now slices across
the dry lake bed.

12:28.791 --> 12:33.643
The reason why Groom Lake was
chosen was very simple:

12:33.671 --> 12:36.480
Groom Lake itself was a dry bed

12:36.507 --> 12:38.906
but it was extremely long,

12:38.968 --> 12:42.652
and it could double
as a huge runway.

12:42.680 --> 12:47.415
Some of these aircraft
required long runways.

12:47.476 --> 12:50.994
For many years, Area 51
enthusiasts were able to watch

12:51.021 --> 12:55.607
with high-powered binocular
lenses and see base activity.

12:55.767 --> 12:57.687
None of that is possible
anymore.

12:57.769 --> 13:00.428
They've gone to great lengths
to keep whatever's happening

13:00.489 --> 13:02.506
at Area 51 a secret.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.585
NARRATOR: For the better
part of a century,

13:04.609 --> 13:09.270
the U.S. government denied
the very existence of Area 51.

13:09.331 --> 13:11.272
But why?

13:11.333 --> 13:15.627
The official Area 51
now admitted by the government

13:15.787 --> 13:20.524
is this facility where aircraft
were developed and test-flown.

13:20.551 --> 13:22.968
The U-2 spy plane.

13:23.128 --> 13:25.286
The SR-71 Blackbird,

13:25.347 --> 13:29.032
and of course, more recently,
stealth technology.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.217
So that's the official Area 51...

13:31.312 --> 13:34.646
highly secret, secure, remote.

13:34.806 --> 13:38.708
But then there's
the unofficial Area 51

13:38.736 --> 13:41.969
where people say that there was
an even bigger secret there.

13:42.031 --> 13:46.408
And that was
extraterrestrial technology.

13:56.495 --> 13:58.356
NARRATOR:
To further investigate

13:58.380 --> 14:01.898
what might be hidden
at the secret Area 51 base,

14:01.925 --> 14:05.402
former British Ministry
of Defense officer Nick Pope

14:05.429 --> 14:08.405
and filmmaker Jeremy Corbell

14:08.432 --> 14:11.332
have enlisted the help
of local resident Joerg Arnu.

14:11.393 --> 14:15.520
Joerg, who has lived in nearby
Rachel, Nevada for 15 years,

14:15.680 --> 14:20.917
has been a firsthand witness
to Area 51's recent history.

14:20.944 --> 14:23.603
What's the strangest, uh,
interaction you've seen

14:23.697 --> 14:25.717
of people coming in or out
of the base?

14:25.741 --> 14:28.274
Heavy construction equipment
going into the base

14:28.369 --> 14:29.679
when they were doing
construction.

14:29.703 --> 14:31.595
And also, sometimes you see

14:31.622 --> 14:34.598
military vehicles being dragged
into the base.

14:34.625 --> 14:36.375
They set them up inside

14:36.535 --> 14:39.269
the bombing ranges
for shooting targets.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.696
Um, just pull over here.

14:41.757 --> 14:43.777
There's a sheriff's vehicle
coming our way.

14:43.801 --> 14:45.384
We don't want any trouble.

14:45.544 --> 14:46.960
We don't want to block them.

14:47.054 --> 14:49.054
We don't want to go any further.

14:49.214 --> 14:51.076
POPE:
This is extra security.

14:51.100 --> 14:53.683
I don't think we've ever seen
quite this much.

14:58.223 --> 15:00.381
NARRATOR:
In light of the tension

15:00.442 --> 15:02.959
surrounding
the Storm Area 51 event,

15:02.986 --> 15:05.737
the military has implemented
a zero-tolerance lockdown

15:05.897 --> 15:09.299
at the gate of the secret base.

15:09.326 --> 15:11.651
POPE:
So, here we are.

15:11.745 --> 15:14.821
I think this is about as far
as we can go.

15:14.915 --> 15:16.898
The point of no return, right?

15:16.959 --> 15:19.251
ARNU:
Yes. We cannot go any further.

15:19.411 --> 15:21.645
POPE:
All this barbed wire here,

15:21.672 --> 15:23.647
all the security measures,

15:23.674 --> 15:26.166
this is the point at which

15:26.260 --> 15:28.910
if you take one step further,

15:28.971 --> 15:33.323
the full force of security
will come down on us, right?

15:33.350 --> 15:35.583
Make no mistake,
we step one step

15:35.644 --> 15:37.914
into that territory, and
everything is going to change.

15:37.938 --> 15:40.497
If I came up here,
is anybody going to talk to me?

15:40.524 --> 15:41.918
- Are they going to say
anything to me? - No.

15:41.942 --> 15:45.777
No. These are signs that
spell out in plain English:

15:45.937 --> 15:48.947
bad things are going to happen
to you if you cross this line.

15:49.107 --> 15:50.635
-POPE: Right.
-ARNU: It's very clear.

15:50.659 --> 15:51.841
So now look,

15:51.869 --> 15:54.861
if we walked past that barrier,

15:54.955 --> 15:56.680
up that road, what would we see?

15:56.707 --> 15:58.364
What would we find?

15:58.459 --> 16:02.443
We would be walking down
about 20 miles of paved road

16:02.504 --> 16:06.523
into the valley that Area 51
is located in.

16:06.550 --> 16:09.951
In between here and the base,

16:10.012 --> 16:11.531
there's more security
checkpoints,

16:11.555 --> 16:13.713
there's more road sensors.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.141
If you were to get to Area 51,

16:16.301 --> 16:18.459
you're standing there
and you look around

16:18.520 --> 16:21.963
and it looks like any other
military Air Force base.

16:22.024 --> 16:24.207
But the good stuff
is all in hangars.

16:24.234 --> 16:25.892
It is not out in the open.

16:25.986 --> 16:27.714
It's not like, you know,
they got the saucer

16:27.738 --> 16:29.229
right there on the runway.

16:29.323 --> 16:31.134
-So, there are hangers obviously.
-Yeah.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.882
But, uh, there are even rumors

16:32.910 --> 16:35.552
of huge underground facilities,

16:35.579 --> 16:38.888
facilities carved into the sides
of the mountains.

16:38.916 --> 16:42.316
There are people that talk about
underground facilities.

16:42.377 --> 16:45.319
They keep tabs on people
that watch the base.

16:45.380 --> 16:47.914
They know exactly when
somebody's up on Tikaboo Peak,

16:48.008 --> 16:50.416
for instance, one of
the view spots of the base.

16:50.511 --> 16:54.087
NARRATOR: Located 26 miles
from the Area 51 base,

16:54.181 --> 16:57.665
Tikaboo Peak
is the only public land

16:57.726 --> 16:59.871
where people can actually see
the Groom Lake runway

16:59.895 --> 17:01.686
and hangars.

17:01.846 --> 17:04.246
And they know exactly, "Okay,
right now is a good moment"

17:04.348 --> 17:05.915
to fly our good stuff,"

17:05.943 --> 17:07.545
and that's when they bring out
the good stuff.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.329
I've actually been
on Tikaboo Peak

17:09.354 --> 17:10.862
when they did a test-flight

17:11.021 --> 17:13.439
and it was
the most amazing thing.

17:13.534 --> 17:15.614
We look at the base
and all of a sudden,

17:15.694 --> 17:19.279
in the middle of the night,
all the runway lights come on.

17:19.373 --> 17:21.267
I mean, it's-it's the most
amazing thing to watch.

17:21.290 --> 17:24.025
All of a sudden,
the-the desert in front of you,

17:24.086 --> 17:25.877
below you, becomes alive.

17:26.037 --> 17:28.380
You see a light taxiing
to the runway,

17:28.540 --> 17:30.456
the light takes off,

17:30.551 --> 17:32.445
the runway lights go out,
the light goes out,

17:32.469 --> 17:35.387
and that was the end of that.

17:35.547 --> 17:37.947
I mean, literally feet
above the runway,

17:37.975 --> 17:39.966
the lights just went out.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.788
-That's ultra-high security.
-Yes.

17:41.812 --> 17:43.711
And whatever that thing was,

17:43.772 --> 17:47.290
- clearly they were really
trying to protect it... - Yes.

17:47.317 --> 17:50.310
...and minimizing that anyone
could get eyes on it.

17:50.404 --> 17:52.145
Correct.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.926
NARRATOR: Could claims that the U.S.
military

17:54.950 --> 17:58.410
discovered otherworldly
spacecraft be true?

17:58.570 --> 18:00.653
Might some of post-war America's

18:00.747 --> 18:02.550
greatest technological
accomplishments

18:02.574 --> 18:03.898
have been the result

18:03.959 --> 18:07.401
of reverse engineering
alien vehicles?

18:07.462 --> 18:10.755
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

18:10.915 --> 18:14.000
and insist that the truth
about Area 51

18:14.094 --> 18:17.170
was actually revealed
decades ago,

18:17.264 --> 18:20.840
not by UFO enthusiasts
or whistle-blowers,

18:20.934 --> 18:24.010
but by two of the men
most responsible

18:24.104 --> 18:27.397
for maintaining the government's
most vital secrets.

18:38.109 --> 18:40.768
NARRATOR:
In the midst of World War II,

18:40.829 --> 18:44.347
the government presses the
Lockheed Aircraft Corporation

18:44.374 --> 18:47.942
to develop the next generation
of military planes...

18:48.003 --> 18:51.371
jet fighters designed to
outflank propeller aircraft

18:51.465 --> 18:54.674
and help turn the tide of war.

18:56.961 --> 18:59.286
A team headed by
Lockheed engineer

18:59.348 --> 19:01.364
Clarence "Kelly" Johnson

19:01.391 --> 19:06.293
delivers the first production
model in just 143 days.

19:06.355 --> 19:08.963
Their P-80 Shooting Star

19:09.024 --> 19:13.134
initiates the jet age
for the U.S. military.

19:13.195 --> 19:15.987
Kelly Johnson's secret research
and development team

19:16.147 --> 19:18.973
ultimately becomes known...

19:19.034 --> 19:21.217
as "Skunk Works."

19:21.244 --> 19:23.310
DOLAN:
Clarence Kelly Johnson

19:23.372 --> 19:26.406
was the first head of Lockheed's
Skunk Works division

19:26.500 --> 19:29.834
back in the '50s and '60s,
up until 1975.

19:29.994 --> 19:33.320
He's the developer
of the U-2 spy plane

19:33.382 --> 19:35.656
which was able to fly
at the incredible altitude

19:35.717 --> 19:37.175
of 80,000 feet,

19:37.335 --> 19:38.905
equipped with
photographic capabilities

19:38.929 --> 19:40.904
that were astonishing.

19:40.931 --> 19:44.574
And he is a great legend in the
aviation community, for sure.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.686
NARRATOR: Despite his
mainstream credentials,

19:47.846 --> 19:50.763
Johnson becomes
the primary witness

19:50.857 --> 19:54.341
to a now-famous UFO sighting
in Agoura, California,

19:54.403 --> 19:57.862
on December 16, 1953.

19:58.022 --> 20:00.031
His report of the encounter,

20:00.191 --> 20:02.053
and his personal sketches
of the craft,

20:02.077 --> 20:04.277
were preserved
by Project Blue Book,

20:04.371 --> 20:06.411
the U.S. government's
official account

20:06.531 --> 20:09.541
of the UFO phenomenon
at the time.

20:09.701 --> 20:12.785
DOLAN: He was with some of
his colleagues at the time

20:12.879 --> 20:15.029
when he saw a very,
very unusual object

20:15.090 --> 20:18.458
that he could not explain
in any kind of technology

20:18.552 --> 20:20.610
that was familiar to him
at the time.

20:20.637 --> 20:25.206
NARRATOR: During an era of
official skepticism about UFOs,

20:25.267 --> 20:27.541
Johnson risks his career

20:27.602 --> 20:30.061
by reporting the sighting
to his superiors.

20:30.221 --> 20:34.624
But instead of being penalized
or demoted,

20:34.651 --> 20:37.293
Johnson is seemingly rewarded
two years later,

20:37.320 --> 20:39.812
when he plays a pivotal role
in founding America's

20:39.906 --> 20:45.392
most secret military base:
Area 51.

20:45.454 --> 20:48.137
Kelly Johnson was the person
that identified

20:48.165 --> 20:51.732
the location where Area 51 is
as a good strategic location.

20:51.793 --> 20:56.403
It is fundamentally located
in the right part of the world

20:56.465 --> 20:58.423
without prying eyes.

20:58.583 --> 21:03.428
NARRATOR: But was Area 51 founded
merely to test experimental aircraft,

21:03.588 --> 21:06.931
as the military insists?

21:07.091 --> 21:11.752
Or did Kelly Johnson choose
the location as the best place

21:11.813 --> 21:15.256
to reverse engineer
the very alien spacecraft

21:15.317 --> 21:18.067
he believed he saw
with his own eyes?

21:21.448 --> 21:24.357
Kelly Johnson died in 1990,

21:24.451 --> 21:28.861
without ever disclosing
the secrets of Area 51.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.939
But a key person
in his inner circle

21:32.000 --> 21:35.109
openly expressed his belief
that extraterrestrials

21:35.170 --> 21:38.046
are present on Earth.

21:45.514 --> 21:49.198
Aviation designer
Benjamin Robert Rich

21:49.226 --> 21:53.369
succeeds Kelly Johnson as the
second director of Skunk Works.

21:53.396 --> 21:56.606
He will eventually become known
as the "father of stealth."

21:58.819 --> 22:01.227
Ben Rich was one
of the real legends

22:01.321 --> 22:03.321
of the history
of American aviation,

22:03.481 --> 22:05.134
and-and the classified world
in general.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.474
And he's famously known
as the man

22:07.536 --> 22:10.811
who's really behind the design
of the F-117A Nighthawk.

22:10.872 --> 22:12.722
That's the stealth fighter

22:12.749 --> 22:16.751
which would revolutionize
aviation in the 1980s and 90s.

22:18.830 --> 22:23.007
NARRATOR: Another aviation expert
and colleague, Jim Goodall,

22:23.167 --> 22:25.902
heard rumors that Ben Rich
had information

22:25.929 --> 22:28.754
confirming the existence
of UFOs,

22:28.849 --> 22:31.332
so he decided to ask,
point blank,

22:31.393 --> 22:35.502
what this legendary head
of Skunk Works really believed.

22:35.564 --> 22:38.839
JIM GOODALL: Mr. Ben Rich
was a friend of mine,

22:38.900 --> 22:41.860
and just before he passed away,
I asked him, I said,

22:42.020 --> 22:43.695
"Do you believe in UFOs?"

22:43.855 --> 22:45.588
He said, he said, "Jim",

22:45.615 --> 22:47.607
"we have things
out in the desert

22:47.701 --> 22:51.277
"that are 50 years beyond
what you can comprehend.

22:51.371 --> 22:53.507
"Not what you think
you can build in 50 years,

22:53.531 --> 22:55.932
"but what you can comprehend.

22:55.959 --> 22:59.118
"And if you've seen movies
like <i> Star Trek</i> and <i> Star Wars,</i>

22:59.212 --> 23:01.528
we've been there, done that."

23:01.590 --> 23:06.533
To me, I think it was
a deathbed confession.

23:06.595 --> 23:08.573
CORBELL:
This is a man that would know

23:08.597 --> 23:11.556
what technologies we have
in our inventory as humans

23:11.716 --> 23:13.282
and what we don't.

23:13.310 --> 23:16.802
Ben Rich was a believer in UFOs.

23:16.897 --> 23:20.231
I think beyond believer,
I think he knew.

23:20.391 --> 23:23.960
NARRATOR: But of all the
people who worked at Area 51,

23:23.987 --> 23:29.315
perhaps the most famous,
or infamous, is Bob Lazar.

23:29.409 --> 23:33.912
No one has been more
inflammatory, or controversial.

23:34.072 --> 23:36.489
As far as alien enthusiasts
are concerned,

23:36.583 --> 23:39.083
Lazar has done more to turn

23:39.243 --> 23:41.327
a previously unknown
military base

23:41.421 --> 23:43.737
in the middle
of an obscure Nevada desert

23:43.798 --> 23:47.667
into the white-hot center of
America's obsession with UFOs,

23:47.761 --> 23:51.745
aliens and government
conspiracies.

23:51.806 --> 23:54.490
But who is Bob Lazar?

23:54.517 --> 23:57.977
And what did he see at Area 51?

24:06.613 --> 24:10.189
Who among us has not heard about
an alleged UFO cover-up?

24:10.283 --> 24:12.136
NARRATOR:
On local TV station KLAS,

24:12.160 --> 24:15.269
investigative reporter
George Knapp

24:15.330 --> 24:18.272
interviews a man going by
the name "Dennis"

24:18.333 --> 24:21.108
and shot in silhouette
to hide his identity.

24:21.169 --> 24:25.296
The man claims to work at the
secret military installation

24:25.456 --> 24:28.357
that the U.S. government
still maintains does not exist.

24:28.385 --> 24:31.803
And according to him,
the base does, in fact,

24:31.963 --> 24:34.514
hold extraterrestrial
spacecraft.

24:36.977 --> 24:39.202
GEORGE KNAPP: Exactly what's
going on up there?

24:39.229 --> 24:43.147
BOB LAZAR: Well, there's
several, uh, actually nine, uh,

24:43.307 --> 24:45.374
flying saucers, flying disks,

24:45.402 --> 24:48.569
uh, that are out there
of extraterrestrial origin.

24:50.907 --> 24:52.301
POPE:
Here was someone

24:52.325 --> 24:53.886
who claimed to have worked
at Area 51,

24:53.910 --> 24:57.737
back engineering
alien technology.

24:57.831 --> 25:01.148
UFOs that had crashed,
possibly at Roswell,

25:01.209 --> 25:03.668
and trying to figure out
how they worked.

25:03.828 --> 25:08.423
And then maybe
building one ourselves.

25:10.510 --> 25:11.988
NARRATOR:
Frightened that the government

25:12.012 --> 25:14.754
might try to harm him
if he remains anonymous,

25:14.848 --> 25:17.423
the whistle-blower
and reporter George Knapp

25:17.517 --> 25:21.335
wrestle with the idea
of revealing his name.

25:21.396 --> 25:24.764
The day that we unveiled
his identity to the world,

25:24.858 --> 25:27.767
he's in the station
and he grabs the tape,

25:27.861 --> 25:30.269
he said, "I've changed my mind,
not gonna do it."

25:30.363 --> 25:32.755
Right up to the end,
he was fighting it

25:32.782 --> 25:35.349
and arguing with himself
about whether it's a good idea,

25:35.410 --> 25:36.846
even though his life
had been threatened,

25:36.870 --> 25:40.187
his life had been
turned upside down.

25:40.248 --> 25:41.684
NARRATOR: In the end,
the whistle-blower decided

25:41.708 --> 25:43.041
to come out from the shadows

25:43.201 --> 25:46.461
and reveal his name... Bob Lazar.

25:48.423 --> 25:50.663
The one good thing Bob Lazar did
was came forward

25:50.708 --> 25:53.459
with George Knapp
in 1989 on May 15,

25:53.553 --> 25:56.870
and by doing that,
he protected himself.

25:56.931 --> 26:00.207
He was scared for his life,
and he protected himself

26:00.268 --> 26:04.136
by telling you what happened
to him in one shot, straight up.

26:04.230 --> 26:07.231
NARRATOR:
From that day onward,

26:07.391 --> 26:11.385
Bob Lazar has remained the most
controversial UFO whistle-blower

26:11.446 --> 26:15.722
in history, and going public
came at a heavy price.

26:15.784 --> 26:19.985
A price many believe was exacted
by a government

26:20.080 --> 26:24.640
determined to hide the truth
about Area 51.

26:24.667 --> 26:27.476
Not only was Bob's house
broken into and they'd

26:27.504 --> 26:30.329
move stuff around, they'd write
things on the, on the wall.

26:30.423 --> 26:32.318
He's got an Uzi
peeking out the window.

26:32.342 --> 26:34.074
The fear was real.

26:34.135 --> 26:36.594
The threats that were made
against him were real.

26:36.754 --> 26:38.337
The surveillance was real.

26:38.431 --> 26:40.990
NARRATOR:
Faced with such harassment,

26:41.017 --> 26:44.769
Lazar retreated
from public view for decades.

26:44.929 --> 26:48.013
I don't like being
in the public eye.

26:48.108 --> 26:50.002
I don't have money
for doing this,

26:50.026 --> 26:52.518
and quite frankly,
I could make up a better lie,

26:52.612 --> 26:55.596
but I have no motivation to lie.

26:55.657 --> 26:58.674
NARRATOR: But if Bob
Lazar's claims are true,

26:58.701 --> 27:01.119
just how much could he expose

27:01.279 --> 27:04.789
about what's really going on
at Area 51?

27:04.949 --> 27:09.776
On December 4, 2018,

27:09.838 --> 27:12.779
Lazar finally decided
to end years of silence

27:12.841 --> 27:16.950
and tell his full story
to filmmaker Jeremy Corbell

27:17.011 --> 27:18.823
in an explosive
documentary entitled

27:18.847 --> 27:24.533
<i>Bob Lazar: Area 51
and Flying Saucers.</i>

27:24.561 --> 27:27.461
LAZAR:
In the late 1980s,

27:27.522 --> 27:31.632
the U.S. government
had recovered alien spacecraft,

27:31.693 --> 27:33.133
several of them,

27:33.194 --> 27:36.395
and the technology,
in the Nevada desert

27:36.489 --> 27:39.473
that they were keeping quiet
and analyzing.

27:39.534 --> 27:40.825
That's a fact.

27:40.985 --> 27:44.645
That's all my story was,

27:44.706 --> 27:48.391
was that I was just one of the
people working on these craft.

27:48.418 --> 27:53.896
There probably wouldn't be
this awareness of Area 51

27:53.923 --> 27:55.414
without Bob Lazar.

27:55.508 --> 27:59.326
And now we have the film,
and suddenly

27:59.387 --> 28:02.054
he's back in the media
and the public eye.

28:04.434 --> 28:06.912
NARRATOR: The most extraordinary
technology that Lazar claims

28:06.936 --> 28:09.353
to have encountered at Area 51

28:09.513 --> 28:12.506
was an alien reactor,
one that he believes

28:12.567 --> 28:15.693
has the potential
to change the world.

28:15.853 --> 28:19.422
LAZAR: The first time they showed
me the reactor in operation,

28:19.449 --> 28:21.682
just seeing something like that

28:21.743 --> 28:24.518
immediately starts that whole
chain reaction in your mind

28:24.579 --> 28:26.762
going, "Wow, wait,
if you can do this",

28:26.789 --> 28:28.350
"we don't need jet
and rocket engines anymore.

28:28.374 --> 28:30.041
"That means there's... wait...

28:30.201 --> 28:32.062
there's no use for cars."
I mean, boom,

28:32.086 --> 28:33.786
the whole thing changes.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.789
The entire world economy,
everything,

28:36.883 --> 28:39.792
would go end-on-end,
just if we had

28:39.886 --> 28:42.220
an answer to how
that machine worked

28:42.380 --> 28:44.947
that I was sitting there,
touching.

28:44.974 --> 28:49.785
NARRATOR: Jeremy Corbell's
documentary caused a sensation,

28:49.812 --> 28:54.306
bringing Bob Lazar and Area 51
into the spotlight once again.

28:54.400 --> 28:58.051
Ultimately,
it provided the spark

28:58.112 --> 29:00.963
that ignited the
Storm Area 51 movement.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.052
ALEX DISCHINGER: We're all here
thanks to Bob Lazar

29:03.076 --> 29:07.319
and, uh, his good work
and bravery, to be honest.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.099
I think, you know,
with the Internet,

29:09.123 --> 29:10.976
we're just gonna continue
to see more and more people

29:11.000 --> 29:12.475
explore the ideas.

29:12.502 --> 29:14.063
It's gonna grow
hotter and hotter

29:14.087 --> 29:15.795
as people continue to question.

29:17.674 --> 29:19.318
NARRATOR:
Is the U.S. government

29:19.342 --> 29:22.409
still operating a longstanding
campaign to suppress

29:22.470 --> 29:25.412
the truth about Area 51?

29:25.473 --> 29:26.839
Perhaps further clues

29:26.933 --> 29:29.658
can be found
in information exposed

29:29.686 --> 29:32.419
by other whistle-blowers.

29:32.480 --> 29:35.088
Whistle-blowers who claim
that Bob Lazar

29:35.149 --> 29:38.091
isn't the only one
who has discovered the truth

29:38.152 --> 29:40.594
and then been harassed
and discredited

29:40.655 --> 29:42.488
by the U.S. government.

29:48.621 --> 29:51.271
NARRATOR: Critics of Bob Lazar
and his audacious claims

29:51.332 --> 29:55.108
about alien craft
being studied at Area 51

29:55.169 --> 29:57.795
insist that there is no proof
of him ever having worked

29:57.955 --> 30:00.372
at the top secret
military facility.

30:00.466 --> 30:02.282
They suggest that his stories

30:02.343 --> 30:03.884
are simply made up.

30:06.139 --> 30:09.532
But a powerful new witness
has come forward

30:09.559 --> 30:12.292
to corroborate Lazar's story,

30:12.353 --> 30:16.038
former Air Force pilot
David Fruehauf.

30:16.065 --> 30:18.874
DAVID FRUEHAUF: It's only been
for me, personally,

30:18.901 --> 30:20.726
in the last few years,

30:20.820 --> 30:23.546
all of a sudden,
Bob Lazar's statements

30:23.573 --> 30:24.971
and all the things he had said

30:25.033 --> 30:27.158
have gelled now to the point

30:27.318 --> 30:29.327
where I think
he's very credible.

30:31.205 --> 30:33.017
NARRATOR:
While critics routinely claim

30:33.041 --> 30:35.816
that Lazar's supporters
lack any credibility,

30:35.877 --> 30:38.753
they can hardly make that claim
about Fruehauf.

30:48.848 --> 30:53.409
U.S. Air Force Captain
David Fruehauf

30:53.436 --> 30:55.260
joins an elite group of pilots

30:55.355 --> 30:57.374
flying America's
most sophisticated spy plane,

30:57.398 --> 30:59.582
the SR-71.

30:59.609 --> 31:04.103
FRUEHAUF: I was an SR-71 pilot
for four and a half years.

31:04.197 --> 31:06.605
The aircraft,
as far as performance went,

31:06.699 --> 31:09.850
it was an hour
from coast to coast.

31:09.911 --> 31:13.612
It would warp your mind
with that kind of performance.

31:13.706 --> 31:17.708
And you just felt so proud
that you were...

31:17.868 --> 31:20.527
had an opportunity
to-to fly that airplane

31:20.588 --> 31:23.622
and to be a part of that unit
and those people.

31:23.716 --> 31:25.274
It was family.

31:25.301 --> 31:28.535
NARRATOR: No one is surprised
when the military assigns

31:28.596 --> 31:30.871
such an elite pilot

31:30.932 --> 31:34.725
to duties at America's
most top secret Air Force base.

31:34.885 --> 31:37.136
FRUEHAUF:
I worked at Area 51

31:37.230 --> 31:42.549
for six years,
from 1979 till 1985.

31:42.610 --> 31:46.570
You had to have a special
clearance, a top secret SBI,

31:46.730 --> 31:49.131
Special Background
Investigation.

31:49.158 --> 31:52.484
Fortunately, I had gotten that
while I was flying the SR,

31:52.578 --> 31:54.728
so it was an easy transition
for me

31:54.789 --> 31:58.641
to move from the SR-71
and my clearances and all

31:58.668 --> 32:01.326
over into Area 51.

32:01.421 --> 32:03.979
NARRATOR:
Along with his colleagues,

32:04.006 --> 32:08.408
Fruehauf commuted each day from
McCarran Airport in Las Vegas

32:08.469 --> 32:10.653
to Area 51,

32:10.680 --> 32:15.415
using a mysterious government
carrier named Janet Airlines.

32:15.476 --> 32:18.238
BIRNES: One of the great
stories about Area 51

32:18.262 --> 32:20.162
comes from engineer TD Barnes.

32:20.189 --> 32:21.847
Here's what he said.

32:21.941 --> 32:24.442
"If there were UFOs
being reversed engineered

32:24.602 --> 32:27.002
at this base,
I wouldn't know about it,"

32:27.029 --> 32:30.281
because you flew out
in an airline, Janet Airlines,

32:30.441 --> 32:32.432
and the windows were blacked out

32:32.493 --> 32:34.012
so you didn't know
where you were going.

32:34.036 --> 32:35.681
NARRATOR:
Fruehauf noticed

32:35.705 --> 32:37.771
that on his daily commutes,

32:37.832 --> 32:40.699
a select group of scientists
and military personnel

32:40.793 --> 32:44.128
also boarded the Janet 737
in Las Vegas.

32:45.789 --> 32:47.856
When the plane landed
at Area 51,

32:47.884 --> 32:50.634
this group boarded a bus

32:50.794 --> 32:52.772
and headed to an even more
secretive facility

32:52.796 --> 32:56.790
code-named Site Four, or S-4.

32:56.851 --> 33:00.811
FRUEHAUF: When I was
there, we knew about S-4,

33:00.971 --> 33:02.708
but we didn't know
what they did.

33:02.732 --> 33:05.057
All we knew was there was
certain people that got on

33:05.151 --> 33:09.487
the 737 in the morning,
and we got to Area 51,

33:09.647 --> 33:12.823
they would take and go off in
a different direction in a bus

33:12.983 --> 33:14.461
and then we went on
to the north,

33:14.485 --> 33:16.735
going up towards the hangars.

33:16.829 --> 33:21.223
NARRATOR: Fruehauf never knew exactly
what was going on at Site Four

33:21.250 --> 33:24.059
during his time at Area 51.

33:24.086 --> 33:27.746
But when he heard Bob Lazar's
story years later,

33:27.840 --> 33:30.000
he found that Lazar's
description of flying

33:30.051 --> 33:34.903
to Area 51 on a Janet 737
and traveling to S-4

33:34.931 --> 33:37.589
rang true in every detail.

33:37.683 --> 33:41.519
FRUEHAUF: When I heard, uh,
Bob Lazar describe getting on the 737

33:41.679 --> 33:45.097
and fly to Area 51 and get off

33:45.191 --> 33:49.843
and go through the terminal
and go to, uh, S-4...

33:49.904 --> 33:52.679
and everything he talked about
and the way he put it,

33:52.740 --> 33:55.682
uh, he sounded totally,
uh, believable to me.

33:55.743 --> 33:58.430
NARRATOR: Critics contend
that no actual eyewitnesses

33:58.454 --> 34:00.353
have ever come forward

34:00.414 --> 34:06.101
to confirm that Lazar worked at
Area 51, much less at Site Four.

34:06.128 --> 34:08.620
But Fruehauf claims otherwise.

34:08.714 --> 34:10.400
FRUEHAUF:
I know people

34:10.424 --> 34:13.384
that had worked for me,
that after I left there,

34:13.543 --> 34:15.702
they had seen Bob Lazar there,

34:15.763 --> 34:18.297
and they admitted that
to me recently.

34:18.391 --> 34:22.708
I know that his critics
piled on because obviously,

34:22.770 --> 34:26.730
they did not want the word
to come out that there were,

34:26.889 --> 34:29.882
in fact, uh,
UFOs in our possession,

34:29.944 --> 34:32.735
and that he was
revealing a capability

34:32.896 --> 34:36.465
to perhaps our enemies

34:36.492 --> 34:39.994
that we, in fact, were,
uh, alien technologies.

34:42.665 --> 34:44.731
NARRATOR:
But Dave Fruehauf is not

34:44.792 --> 34:47.643
the only highly regarded
aviation expert

34:47.670 --> 34:50.813
to corroborate
Bob Lazar's explosive story.

34:50.840 --> 34:55.926
Jim Goodall is a U.S. Air Force
veteran, military historian

34:56.085 --> 34:59.671
and investigative author
who befriended Bob Lazar

34:59.765 --> 35:04.326
before Lazar was hired
to work at Area 51.

35:04.353 --> 35:08.180
Back then, Lazar worked
at the Sandia nuclear lab

35:08.274 --> 35:12.425
in Albuquerque,
and was a vocal UFO skeptic.

35:12.486 --> 35:16.839
I have the distinction of
knowing him for quite a while.

35:16.866 --> 35:19.675
Yeah, he had been working
in developing nuclear weapons

35:19.702 --> 35:21.360
for Sandia.

35:21.454 --> 35:23.098
You couldn't put
a gun to his head

35:23.122 --> 35:25.456
to convince him
that UFOs were real.

35:25.616 --> 35:27.850
NARRATOR:
But Bob Lazar's skepticism

35:27.877 --> 35:32.020
about the existence of UFOs
was about to change.

35:32.048 --> 35:34.447
GOODALL:
A year later or so,

35:34.508 --> 35:37.468
there's a silhouetted guy
talking about

35:37.628 --> 35:40.379
doing reverse engineering
on alien spacecraft,

35:40.473 --> 35:43.223
and that-that silhouette
was Bob Lazar.

35:45.019 --> 35:46.622
NARRATOR:
In an effort to help his friend

35:46.646 --> 35:49.872
prove he worked
at Area 51 and Site Four,

35:49.899 --> 35:53.299
then-Sergeant Goodall took
Lazar's military tax form

35:53.361 --> 35:57.062
to the Office of Naval
Investigations at the Pentagon.

35:57.156 --> 36:00.991
What happened when he got there
was chilling.

36:01.151 --> 36:04.130
GOODALL: There's a young, uh,
lieutenant commander behind the desk.

36:04.154 --> 36:07.981
And I handed him
Bob Lazar's W-2.

36:08.042 --> 36:12.077
He looks at it, said,
"Excuse me for a minute."

36:12.171 --> 36:15.506
And he says,
"The admiral will see you now."

36:15.666 --> 36:19.492
I mean an admiral, to go talk
to an Air Force tech sergeant

36:19.553 --> 36:23.588
is really below his level
of interrogation.

36:23.683 --> 36:27.242
And he's looking at Lazar's W-2,
and he said,

36:27.269 --> 36:30.187
"Sergeant, I don't know
where in the hell you got this,

36:30.347 --> 36:33.524
"but if I ever see your face
cross my threshold again,

36:33.684 --> 36:36.752
"you'll be the most
sorry son of a bitch NCO

36:36.779 --> 36:38.420
in the United States Air Force,"

36:38.447 --> 36:42.199
as gets Bob's W-2
and he puts it in the shredder.

36:42.359 --> 36:44.927
And he says,
"You are dismissed."

36:44.954 --> 36:47.612
CORBELL:
So he was warned

36:47.707 --> 36:50.857
to stop asking questions
about Bob Lazar.

36:50.918 --> 36:53.377
Anybody trying to seek
the truth about Bob Lazar,

36:53.537 --> 36:55.440
there was pressure
applied on them.

36:55.464 --> 36:56.683
And that's just the way it works

36:56.707 --> 36:58.777
when you want to try
to silence somebody.

36:58.801 --> 37:03.220
NARRATOR: Have the kinds of
pressures exerted against Bob Lazar

37:03.380 --> 37:07.874
continued to obscure the search
for the truth about Area 51?

37:07.935 --> 37:11.061
If so,
will such secrets continue

37:11.221 --> 37:13.032
to remain out of reach
to the activists

37:13.056 --> 37:16.216
of the Storm Area 51 movement?

37:16.277 --> 37:20.386
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

37:20.448 --> 37:24.316
that will depend on a new
generation of truth-seekers,

37:24.410 --> 37:26.994
and a powerful movement that is
just beginning to take shape.

37:40.760 --> 37:45.596
NARRATOR: The Storm Area 51 event
comes to an end without incident.

37:45.756 --> 37:47.159
POPE:
Here in Rachel,

37:47.183 --> 37:49.174
people were fearing the worst.

37:49.268 --> 37:50.746
WAYNE DICE:
So everybody's coming out here,

37:50.770 --> 37:52.789
to-to really,
to see what was gonna happen.

37:52.813 --> 37:54.666
We're out here to make it
a safe event for everybody.

37:54.690 --> 37:57.666
I think the order has come down.

37:57.693 --> 38:00.110
We do not want
mass arrests here.

38:00.270 --> 38:02.187
We do not want trouble.

38:02.281 --> 38:04.009
GEORGE HARRIS: You know,
they had a few arrests,

38:04.033 --> 38:05.193
and, uh, other than that,

38:05.275 --> 38:06.419
they didn't have
any incidents at all.

38:06.443 --> 38:07.659
Everybody behaved.

38:11.791 --> 38:13.602
When we look at all
the disinformation

38:13.626 --> 38:16.535
circling the event
of storming Area 51,

38:16.629 --> 38:19.371
from the media, from the
government, from social media,

38:19.465 --> 38:21.781
it made it a convoluted mess

38:21.842 --> 38:25.377
that was easily something that
most people just chose to avoid.

38:25.471 --> 38:29.197
NARRATOR: Amid what some consider
to be a concerted government effort

38:29.225 --> 38:31.791
to intimidate UFO believers,

38:31.852 --> 38:36.963
many doubt whether the
Storm Area 51 movement can last,

38:37.024 --> 38:39.875
while others hope that this
small beginning will blossom

38:39.902 --> 38:42.135
into something much larger.

38:42.196 --> 38:46.381
POPE: What we might find,
when we look back on this,

38:46.408 --> 38:48.158
is that this was the beginning

38:48.318 --> 38:51.570
of some sort
of cultural movement.

38:51.664 --> 38:55.057
Something that will grow,
year on year.

38:55.084 --> 38:57.909
We might find that it starts

38:58.003 --> 39:00.838
as just maybe
a small one-off event,

39:00.998 --> 39:06.068
but evolves into something
with global recognition...

39:06.095 --> 39:07.572
You're all part of this.
Become active participants,

39:07.596 --> 39:09.662
not passive observers.

39:09.723 --> 39:13.350
POPE: ...and it becomes
a mainstream event.

39:13.510 --> 39:15.430
REDFERN:
I think a lot of people,

39:15.521 --> 39:19.081
particularly due to pop culture,
know of Area 51

39:19.108 --> 39:22.008
and they accept it as gospel

39:22.069 --> 39:25.921
that there really are UFOs
and aliens out there.

39:25.948 --> 39:29.424
That sort of demonstrates how
the public is coming around

39:29.451 --> 39:33.370
to the idea that alien life
is a reality.

39:35.916 --> 39:40.878
KEN LAYNE: For some people, the events
were a good time and a fun weekend.

39:41.038 --> 39:42.998
It could turn
a handful of people

39:43.048 --> 39:46.699
into the next decade's
prominent researchers

39:46.760 --> 39:51.113
on UFOs and government
secrecy and flying saucers

39:51.140 --> 39:55.893
and government corruption and
the military-industrial state.

39:56.053 --> 40:00.731
HOWE: We are at a
revolutionary moment.

40:00.891 --> 40:04.809
You've got an entire generation
of young people now

40:04.904 --> 40:06.798
who have been galvanized,
and they will be looking

40:06.822 --> 40:10.073
for legitimate, credible news

40:10.233 --> 40:12.409
about high strangeness
on this planet

40:12.569 --> 40:15.820
in numbers that have
not happened before.

40:15.915 --> 40:19.157
NARRATOR:
For many, the gates of Area 51

40:19.251 --> 40:22.327
are both real and symbolic.

40:22.421 --> 40:25.589
Real in the sense
that the gates may hide evidence

40:25.749 --> 40:28.592
of an actual
alien presence on Earth,

40:28.752 --> 40:32.095
symbolic in that they represent

40:32.255 --> 40:33.783
the government's
wider determination

40:33.807 --> 40:37.559
to cling to secrecy
for as long as possible.

40:39.855 --> 40:42.681
The U.S. government has kept
so many secrets from the people

40:42.775 --> 40:45.003
that I think that's, you know,
a major driving force

40:45.027 --> 40:46.759
for people to come here.

40:46.820 --> 40:48.590
I don't know if this is
a movement that we're seeing,

40:48.614 --> 40:51.189
but the people want
to know the truth, right?

40:51.283 --> 40:54.192
And they want to know if there
are secrets being kept form us.

40:54.286 --> 40:56.344
And I think
if that forms a movement,

40:56.372 --> 40:57.512
that would be awesome.

40:57.539 --> 40:59.184
COLLIN ANDERSON:
What's behind those gates

40:59.208 --> 41:00.773
is one of the last mysteries.

41:00.834 --> 41:05.520
Bottom of the ocean,
Area 51 and aliens.

41:05.547 --> 41:08.360
POPE: I think the only
way to get the government

41:08.384 --> 41:11.451
to come up with answers
is to keep the pressure on.

41:11.512 --> 41:13.953
Keep demanding answers.

41:14.014 --> 41:18.791
A new generation has to continue
to demand answers,

41:18.852 --> 41:22.628
and do what the past generation
failed to achieve.

41:22.690 --> 41:27.058
NARRATOR: In the end,
some believe that the harsh treatment

41:27.152 --> 41:30.212
once suffered by Bob Lazar
is being repeated today

41:30.239 --> 41:34.491
in the government's response
to the Storm Area 51 movement.

41:34.651 --> 41:37.160
They fear
that under the onslaught

41:37.320 --> 41:38.903
of official intimidation,

41:38.998 --> 41:41.647
the drive for answers
will slowly fade,

41:41.709 --> 41:45.985
and the secrets of Area 51
will remain hidden.

41:46.046 --> 41:49.397
But others are determined
to make this modest event

41:49.425 --> 41:51.842
the beginning of a mass movement

41:52.002 --> 41:55.328
that will ultimately force open
the gates of secrecy

41:55.389 --> 41:58.740
to finally reveal that both
in the universe at large

41:58.767 --> 42:01.743
and right here on Earth,

42:01.770 --> 42:04.670
we are not alone.
