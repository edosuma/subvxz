WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:03.137
[happy chattering]

00:06.640 --> 00:09.143
Good morning, Miss Cheerilee!

00:09.177 --> 00:11.112
Good morning, everypony!

00:11.145 --> 00:12.813
I hope you brought
your thinking caps

00:12.846 --> 00:15.616
because today we're going
to learn about physics!

00:17.351 --> 00:19.053
Physics?

00:19.087 --> 00:24.192
Mm-hm. Specifically, the use of
force in energy conversions.

00:24.225 --> 00:27.528
In this case, using mechanical
work to convert potential energy

00:27.561 --> 00:29.630
into kinetic energy.

00:29.663 --> 00:31.699
The what, now?

00:31.732 --> 00:35.369
Um. Mrs. Cheerilee, that
sounds a bit over our heads.

00:35.403 --> 00:38.172
Yeah. Why would we even
need to know that stuff?

00:38.206 --> 00:39.807
Oh, it's very important.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.677
In fact, you'll most likely
end up using it tomorrow.

00:43.711 --> 00:45.679
Tomorrow? What for?

00:45.713 --> 00:50.551
Why, for participating
in the APPLEWOOD DERBY!

00:50.584 --> 00:56.657
[cheers]

00:56.690 --> 01:00.361
Oh, WHEW! For a second I
thought we were gonna have to

01:00.394 --> 01:02.463
You know... learn stuff.

01:05.833 --> 01:09.337
* My little pony,
my little pony *

01:09.370 --> 01:11.305
* Aaaahhh

01:11.339 --> 01:13.341
* My little Pony

01:13.374 --> 01:15.743
* I used to wonder what
friendship could be. *

01:15.776 --> 01:17.611
* My Little Pony

01:17.645 --> 01:20.248
* Until you all shared
its magic with me. *

01:20.281 --> 01:22.283
* Big adventure!
* Tons of fun

01:22.316 --> 01:24.452
* A beautiful heart! *
Faithful and strong! *

01:24.485 --> 01:26.587
* Sharing kindness
* it's an easy feat

01:26.620 --> 01:28.622
* And magic makes it
all complete! *

01:28.656 --> 01:30.724
* To have my little pony

01:30.758 --> 01:34.228
* Do you know you're all
my very best friends? *

01:34.262 --> 01:37.431
**

01:42.470 --> 01:46.907
We get to race in the Applewood
Derby tomorrow? That's so cool!

01:46.940 --> 01:48.842
My family's talked
about it for years

01:48.876 --> 01:50.611
and now I'm finally
old enough to race!

01:50.644 --> 01:52.613
[knocking]

01:52.646 --> 01:55.816
Now hold onto your
horseshoes, everypony.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.686
You've got a lot of work to do
before you're ready to race.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.589
Yeah, but not
school work, right?

02:03.324 --> 02:05.659
There'll be a block of
applewood just like this one

02:05.693 --> 02:08.296
waiting for you at Sweet
Apple Acres tomorrow

02:08.329 --> 02:11.865
and you've got one day to turn
it into a race-ready cart.

02:11.899 --> 02:14.468
Awwwwww!

02:14.502 --> 02:17.738
Oh, yeah. That is
a lot of work.

02:17.771 --> 02:21.442
Mm-hmm. Luckily, you'll each
get to pick an older pony

02:21.475 --> 02:24.378
to help you. But
choose wisely

02:24.412 --> 02:26.347
because they'll also
have to ride in the cart

02:26.380 --> 02:28.816
with you during the race.

02:28.849 --> 02:32.320
Hmm, I think I know
just the pony to ask!

02:32.353 --> 02:33.287
Me too!

02:33.321 --> 02:34.188
Me three!

02:35.989 --> 02:38.792
Just remember everypony,
your cart has to be able

02:38.826 --> 02:42.530
to finish the race if you want
to win one of the awards.

02:42.563 --> 02:45.899
Fastest, for winning
the race, naturally.

02:45.933 --> 02:48.536
Most Traditional, for
the best working replica

02:48.569 --> 02:50.871
of an original Applewood cart.

02:50.904 --> 02:55.576
And Most Creative, for the cart
with the best overall design.

02:55.609 --> 02:59.847
Hoo-eee! Those ribbons
are the bees' knees.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.749
Uh-huh!

03:01.782 --> 03:04.218
All right then, class.
You've got a lot to learn

03:04.252 --> 03:05.986
if you want to
build a race cart.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.955
[groans]

03:07.988 --> 03:10.891
Oh. I knew there was
gonna be a catch.

03:16.464 --> 03:18.632
Wow, have you seen what the
carts used to look like

03:18.666 --> 03:20.834
in the olden days?

03:20.868 --> 03:23.437
Yeah. I know all about them.

03:23.471 --> 03:24.805
When Ponyville
started the derby,

03:24.838 --> 03:26.740
they decided to
use the wood

03:26.774 --> 03:28.676
from our apple trees
for the carts.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.945
The race has been a part of
Sweet Apple Acres ever since.

03:31.979 --> 03:34.915
I just think these old
carts look so cool.

03:34.948 --> 03:37.618
But I guess you and Applejack
will probably win the award

03:37.651 --> 03:39.620
for most traditional, huh?

03:39.653 --> 03:42.022
The Apples usually
do, but honestly,

03:42.055 --> 03:44.658
I'd rather build the fastest
cart there is and win the race!

03:48.696 --> 03:50.431
But I'm pretty sure
Scoot and Rainbow Dash

03:50.464 --> 03:51.799
will take that award.

03:51.832 --> 03:54.001
You know, I race around
so much on my scooter,

03:54.034 --> 03:57.538
being the fastest isn't such
a big deal. Maybe I'll try

03:57.571 --> 04:00.341
to make the wildest-looking
cart I can think of.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.342
Really?

04:01.375 --> 04:03.377
Sure. If I win
Most Creative,

04:03.411 --> 04:05.813
you can totally win
the award for Fastest.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.382
And I can win the award
for Most Traditional!

04:08.416 --> 04:10.851
Sounds like we're all going
to try something different.

04:10.884 --> 04:12.553
I can't wait to
tell Applejack!

04:12.586 --> 04:13.887
Let's get to it!

04:13.921 --> 04:16.390
GOOOOO CRUSADERS!

04:19.327 --> 04:22.830
Are you kidding! Of course I'll
help with the Applewood Derby!

04:22.863 --> 04:26.334
I want you to have as much fun
as I did when I was a filly.

04:26.367 --> 04:28.902
Wait, Cloudsdale
has a derby too?

04:28.936 --> 04:32.873
Sure! Practically every
town in Equestria has one.

04:32.906 --> 04:36.710
I still remember
racing my cloud cart.

04:36.744 --> 04:41.081
THIS. IS. SO. AWESOME!

04:41.114 --> 04:44.918
WHOOHOOOOO!

04:44.952 --> 04:48.689
**

04:48.722 --> 04:52.693
And let me guess...
You won Fastest Cart.

04:52.726 --> 04:55.062
Obviously!

04:55.095 --> 04:58.332
So what do you say? Will you
help me make my race cart?

04:58.366 --> 05:01.569
Help you? I'm ALL OVER IT.
I've got tons of ideas.

05:03.837 --> 05:07.608
Don't worry, I've got a
lot of ideas of my own.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.710
Um, what are you looking for?

05:09.743 --> 05:12.380
The blueprint for my
Derby cart, of course.

05:12.413 --> 05:15.349
I'll have to change it a little
cause this race is on roads,

05:15.383 --> 05:19.787
not on clouds, but trust me,
your cart is gonna be AMAZING!

05:19.820 --> 05:22.590
Um, OK, Rainbow Dash, thanks!

05:22.623 --> 05:24.558
How awesome is THIS?

05:24.592 --> 05:27.094
With Dash on my team, how
could anything go wrong?

05:29.397 --> 05:31.064
Applejack: Heh, well I'm mighty
flattered you wanna work

05:31.098 --> 05:32.800
with your big sis on your cart.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.502
I mean, the "Applewood
Derby" did...

05:34.535 --> 05:36.837
...start on our farm. I know.

05:36.870 --> 05:39.106
Well, I couldn't be more proud
to help my little sister

05:39.139 --> 05:41.942
take the prize for
"Most Traditional!"

05:41.975 --> 05:46.880
Actually I was kinda thinkin' of
somethin' else. Like fastest?

05:46.914 --> 05:50.518
"Fastest?" Apple Bloom,
things aren't like they were

05:50.551 --> 05:51.952
in the old days.

05:51.985 --> 05:54.655
The fastest cart now has gotta
be slick and modern and...

05:54.688 --> 05:56.023
Exactly!

05:56.056 --> 05:59.793
...not Apple at all. The
Apples win Most Traditional.

05:59.827 --> 06:02.029
We have since the Derby started!

06:02.062 --> 06:04.765
Why would anypony want
to win anything else?

06:04.798 --> 06:07.435
Now, why don't you head off
and get some chamomile vines,

06:07.468 --> 06:09.437
some hickory sticks,
and some apple barrels

06:09.470 --> 06:12.906
and I'll show you what an Apple
Family cart should look like.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.644
I guess I do have a family
tradition to uphold.

06:16.677 --> 06:21.849
[gasp] THE APPLEWOOD
DERBY? Of course I'll help!

06:21.882 --> 06:25.419
Wow, uh, Rarity, I didn't
know you'd be this excited!

06:25.453 --> 06:27.788
Me? Oh why, I'm just itching
to right an old wrong

06:27.821 --> 06:30.090
from long, long ago.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.760
I designed my own cart
when I was just a filly.

06:32.793 --> 06:35.563
And I was positive I was
going to win the prize for

06:35.596 --> 06:37.831
"Most Creative," hooves down.

06:37.865 --> 06:40.768
But I came in second. Second!

06:42.936 --> 06:46.507
You? Second for Most
Creative? To whom?

06:46.540 --> 06:51.945
[cheers]

06:51.979 --> 06:57.017
But I learned a valuable lesson.
I learned to know my audience.

06:57.050 --> 07:00.187
And the race cart audience
wants big! They want bold!

07:02.490 --> 07:05.626
Chop, chop, everypony
out! We've got work to do!

07:07.861 --> 07:10.898
This will take all of
my considerable skills,

07:10.931 --> 07:14.201
but I will fashion the biggest
and boldest derby cart

07:14.234 --> 07:17.037
to ever win the prize
for Most Creative!

07:17.070 --> 07:20.007
Actually, I was sort of
thinking of something more...

07:20.040 --> 07:21.842
traditional?

07:21.875 --> 07:24.912
Oh, ha ha! Oh please, darling,
leave tradition to the Apples.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.914
We're doing big and bold!

07:26.947 --> 07:31.585
Soon the prize for Most Creative
will finally be in my hooves!

07:31.619 --> 07:33.854
You mean MY hooves.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.789
Yes, that's what I
said "my hooves."

07:35.823 --> 07:38.559
Darling, I hope you're ready to
get an early start tomorrow.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.762
Uh, how early?

07:44.998 --> 07:48.569
[birds chirping]

07:52.139 --> 07:58.011
[yawn] Rarity, the
sun's not even up yet!

07:58.045 --> 08:02.950
Oh, Apples, quit complaining. In
my day, we were up even earlier!

08:02.983 --> 08:05.152
Hey, I'd get up in the
middle of the night

08:05.185 --> 08:07.688
if it means my cart crosses
that finish line first

08:07.721 --> 08:09.690
and wins Fastest!

08:09.723 --> 08:12.259
And my cart wins Most Creative!

08:12.292 --> 08:14.695
And my cart wins
Most Traditional!

08:14.728 --> 08:17.798
Hoo-eee!, it's
gonna be a good day!

08:17.831 --> 08:19.933
You mean "our" carts, right?

08:19.967 --> 08:21.569
Yes, that what we said, darling!

08:21.602 --> 08:22.302
Yep!

08:22.335 --> 08:23.737
Our carts!

08:32.079 --> 08:34.615
"Their" carts? It almost
sounds like they're planning

08:34.648 --> 08:36.617
on building them without us.

08:36.650 --> 08:41.054
I'm sure they meant "our" carts,
like the team cart. Right?

08:41.088 --> 08:44.592
Of course! I mean they're
all our older sisters...

08:44.625 --> 08:46.026
practically.

08:46.059 --> 08:49.863
Plus they've all done this
before. I'm sure they know best.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.932
Let's just buckle
down and get to work.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.968
**

09:03.677 --> 09:07.915
[grunts] Scootaloo,
where have you been?

09:07.948 --> 09:11.218
I've only got till noon to
make the fastest cart ever.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.353
Uh, about that.

09:13.386 --> 09:16.323
I was really thinking of going
for the Most Creative prize.

09:16.356 --> 09:19.292
I mean, I know all about
speed already so...

09:19.326 --> 09:22.162
Exactly! It's all about speed.

09:22.195 --> 09:24.732
We've gotta get across the
finish line to win a prize,

09:24.765 --> 09:27.034
so we might as well
get there first, right?

09:27.067 --> 09:29.269
Hey, I left a bunch of
paint cans by the road.

09:29.302 --> 09:30.871
Bring them up here, would ya?

09:30.904 --> 09:32.706
Nothing as fun as
painting racing stripes

09:32.740 --> 09:34.274
on the winning cart!

09:34.307 --> 09:37.277
[sigh] Right. Fun.

09:40.047 --> 09:42.716
Spendin' time building a
cart with my big sister,

09:42.750 --> 09:47.821
why this is just tee-riffic!
Um, how can I help?

09:47.855 --> 09:50.658
You can feast your
eyes on... this!

09:52.225 --> 09:54.261
I mean, it ain't
quite finished yet.

09:54.294 --> 09:56.697
Oh, good.

09:56.730 --> 10:00.701
But don't it have the makings of
the best cart you ever did see?

10:00.734 --> 10:03.904
Uh, is somethin'
wrong, Apple Bloom?

10:03.937 --> 10:06.106
Actually, I was kinda
thinking of something

10:06.139 --> 10:09.810
a little more modern.
And less rickety.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.245
With maybe a chance of winning.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.115
Bless my hooves, I
thought we covered this!

10:15.148 --> 10:18.686
Tradition is all that counts
and who knows tradition better

10:18.719 --> 10:21.689
than Apples? Nopony! That's who!

10:21.722 --> 10:25.225
So are you an Apple
or are you an Apple?

10:25.258 --> 10:28.996
I'm an Apple. But, what if I
just take off this fringe.

10:29.029 --> 10:30.063
NO! NOT THE FRINGE!

10:30.097 --> 10:32.165
[crash]

10:32.199 --> 10:36.303
Why, shoot, now I've gotta
start all over from scratch!

10:36.336 --> 10:38.205
And it's almost race time.

10:38.238 --> 10:42.142
Oh! So maybe we can redesign
it then... just a little.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.678
No time! And who'd want
to redesign something

10:44.712 --> 10:46.747
that's already perfect?

10:46.780 --> 10:50.217
Right. Perfect.

10:50.250 --> 10:53.353
OK, so I sketched
out some of my ideas.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.322
How about a nice
yellow fringe on top?

10:55.355 --> 10:59.760
Oh-ho, darling, the
fringe is not exactly big.

10:59.793 --> 11:03.096
And that yellow is the least
bold color I can imagine.

11:03.130 --> 11:05.298
Well, it doesn't
have to be yellow.

11:05.332 --> 11:08.201
But I really do love the
old-timey style. Like this!

11:11.171 --> 11:13.741
Sweetie Belle, precious face.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.910
"Old-Timey" is just
another word for passé!

11:16.944 --> 11:21.281
Remember, BIG and BOLD! I do
have a reputation to uphold!

11:21.314 --> 11:23.350
It was one thing
to lose as a filly,

11:23.383 --> 11:26.920
but can you imagine if I didn't
win the Most Creative now?

11:26.954 --> 11:30.157
Ponies might stop
buying my couture!

11:30.190 --> 11:32.893
But we're supposed to
be doing this together!

11:32.926 --> 11:34.895
Yes, of course we are, darling.

11:34.928 --> 11:39.432
In fact, we just
finished! Voila!

11:39.466 --> 11:41.969
I know. You're speechless.

11:42.002 --> 11:45.005
But if that isn't big and
bold, I don't know what is.

11:45.038 --> 11:47.374
Isn't it wonderful?

11:47.407 --> 11:50.077
[sigh] Right. Wonderful.

11:50.110 --> 11:53.113
**

13:10.290 --> 13:12.960
Hey, Crusader.
How's it goin'?

13:12.993 --> 13:14.261
[sigh]

13:14.294 --> 13:17.030
Rarity's definitely made
the biggest, boldest cart

13:17.064 --> 13:18.365
anypony's ever seen.

13:20.633 --> 13:24.604
Wow. Well, Applejack's built
something so traditional

13:24.637 --> 13:28.141
it's practically an antique.

13:28.175 --> 13:32.112
No matter what I say, there's
no talking Rainbow Dash

13:32.145 --> 13:35.082
out of making the fastest
cart in Equestria.

13:35.115 --> 13:39.052
Doesn't look like any of us
ended up with what we wanted.

13:39.086 --> 13:43.356
But I'm sure our older sisters
know what they're doing, right?

13:43.390 --> 13:45.225
Right.
Right.

13:45.258 --> 13:48.228
And even if our carts aren't
exactly what we had in mind,

13:48.261 --> 13:50.898
it'll still be fun to drive
them to the finish line.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.166
Sure. The race is
the best part!

13:53.200 --> 13:58.171
Yeah. CMCs behind the
wheels! Yeah! [cheers]

13:58.205 --> 14:00.440
Derby Racers, to
the starting line!

14:00.473 --> 14:03.410
Derby Racers, to
the starting line!

14:03.443 --> 14:05.545
The race is about
to start, Scootaloo.

14:05.578 --> 14:08.949
You better shake a leg if you
want a ride in the winning cart.

14:08.982 --> 14:11.384
You too, Sweetie Belle. There's
only one seat left aboard

14:11.418 --> 14:15.255
this creative masterpiece and
it's just for you. Woo-hoo!

14:15.288 --> 14:17.557
Whoa, ponies! Wait for me!

14:17.590 --> 14:22.529
This traditional cart handles at
the exact perfect pace. Slow!

14:22.562 --> 14:26.166
And I got the passenger seat all
warmed up for you, Apple Bloom!

14:26.199 --> 14:27.334
Passenger seat?

14:34.107 --> 14:39.079
**

14:39.112 --> 14:42.515
Ugh. They're the only
older ponies driving!

14:42.549 --> 14:45.953
First they built the carts;
now they're gonna drive them?

14:45.986 --> 14:47.620
I know they were
all excited to help,

14:47.654 --> 14:49.990
but I don't think they're
really helping any more.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.993
We better hurry if we want to
be a part of this race at all!

14:55.528 --> 14:58.331
Um, aren't you all
missing somepony?

14:58.365 --> 15:00.133
They'll be along.

15:00.167 --> 15:03.570
And uh, usually the younger
ponies drive the carts.

15:03.603 --> 15:07.207
Darling, do these look
like "usual" carts to you?

15:18.518 --> 15:21.021
* [trumpet fanfare]

15:21.054 --> 15:23.056
Racers, on your marks.

15:23.090 --> 15:25.058
Get set... GO!

15:25.092 --> 15:28.061
**

15:28.095 --> 15:30.297
AAAAH!

15:30.330 --> 15:33.700
AAAAHHHH!

15:33.733 --> 15:38.405
AAAHHH... can't
we go any faster?

15:38.438 --> 15:42.309
Faster? Don't be
silly; this is perfect!

15:42.342 --> 15:43.376
Ugh.

15:43.410 --> 15:48.481
**

15:48.515 --> 15:50.417
* GO GO GO!

15:50.450 --> 15:53.520
**

15:53.553 --> 15:55.455
* Check me out: racin' the
Derby! *

15:55.488 --> 15:57.590
* Check out my old-fashioned
cart! *

15:57.624 --> 15:59.692
* Check me out: racing
the Derby *

15:59.726 --> 16:01.995
* in my original work of art!

16:02.029 --> 16:04.264
* Check me out:
faster than ever

16:04.297 --> 16:06.233
There's nopony can
catch me now! *

16:06.266 --> 16:09.302
* Let me out! I'd do it over

16:09.336 --> 16:11.771
* if I only knew how!

16:11.804 --> 16:15.008
**

16:15.042 --> 16:17.044
* Giddy-up,
Derby Racers! *

16:17.077 --> 16:19.179
* Giddy-up,
Derby Racers! *

16:19.212 --> 16:21.214
* Giddy-up,
Derby Racers *

16:21.248 --> 16:23.216
* GO GO GO!

16:23.250 --> 16:26.453
**

16:26.486 --> 16:28.521
* My cart's the most original!

16:28.555 --> 16:30.690
* Designed with imagination.

16:30.723 --> 16:32.692
* My cart's the most
traditional! *

16:32.725 --> 16:35.028
* Just plain no complications.

16:35.062 --> 16:37.497
* Look at me I am the Ace!

16:37.530 --> 16:39.699
* Might as well give
up the chase. *

16:39.732 --> 16:43.670
* Wish we could stop this race,
start again and do it our way. *

16:43.703 --> 16:45.472
Having any fun yet?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.807
Nope! Maybe if we could
go a little faster.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.609
* Giddy-up,
Derby Racers! *

16:49.642 --> 16:51.711
* Giddy-up,
Derby Racers! *

16:51.744 --> 16:53.746
* Giddy-up,
Derby Racers *

16:53.780 --> 16:55.715
* GO GO GO!

16:55.748 --> 16:59.286
*

16:59.319 --> 17:03.423
* Gotta get some attention
if I want that ribbon! *

17:03.456 --> 17:07.627
* Gotta push the limits further,
blow away the competition! *

17:07.660 --> 17:11.631
* Gotta coast on through, just
relax we're gonna cruise it. *

17:11.664 --> 17:13.366
* Guess I don't really care

17:13.400 --> 17:16.169
* since we're clearly
gonna lose it. *

17:16.203 --> 17:20.340
* See everypony's watching,
presentation is our glory. *

17:20.373 --> 17:24.477
* Just passed you even faster,
speed is king end of story! *

17:24.511 --> 17:26.713
* Bigger, Bolder
down the track *

17:26.746 --> 17:29.282
* Love the view from
the back of the pack. *

17:29.316 --> 17:31.284
* Won't stop, we're
on the attack! *

17:31.318 --> 17:33.286
* Too late to take it
all back! *

17:33.320 --> 17:37.224
**

17:37.257 --> 17:39.226
* Giddy-up,

17:39.259 --> 17:41.261

* GO GO

17:44.531 --> 17:46.566
LOOK OUT!

17:46.599 --> 17:49.102
[crash]

17:49.136 --> 17:53.806
[moans]

17:53.840 --> 17:59.146
Oh! My beautiful swan
cart is an ugly duckling!

17:59.179 --> 18:01.748
And my old time cart is
a rootin'-tootin' wreck!

18:04.917 --> 18:08.355
It still counts as a win if I
push my cart across, right?

18:13.260 --> 18:15.362
THEY'RE NOT YOUR CARTS!

18:17.430 --> 18:18.765
HUH?

18:18.798 --> 18:20.533
We were supposed
to design them.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.470
And we were supposed
to drive them.

18:23.503 --> 18:27.440
The Derby was supposed to be
for us, not the three of you!

18:27.474 --> 18:29.642
Now you've ruined
it for everypony!

18:34.547 --> 18:35.848
[whimper]

18:35.882 --> 18:37.484
[thud]

18:37.517 --> 18:39.386
Yes. Well, I suppose
we might have gotten

18:39.419 --> 18:41.754
a teensy bit carried away.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.224
But I thought you
all wanted our help.

18:44.257 --> 18:47.694
We did. We wanted your
help to build our carts,

18:47.727 --> 18:49.362
but we all ended
up with carts

18:49.396 --> 18:51.431
that are what each
of you wanted.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.333
Umm-hmm.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.835
Well, why didn't
you say anything?

18:55.868 --> 18:59.539
You've all done the race before.
I just figured you knew best.

18:59.572 --> 19:02.575
Plus it's hard to speak
up to older ponies.

19:02.609 --> 19:04.911
Oh, I certainly
understand that,

19:04.944 --> 19:09.249
but you mustn't think older
ponies automatically know best.

19:09.282 --> 19:11.418
And we probably could
have done a better job

19:11.451 --> 19:13.620
of listening to you.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.290
I guess we owe all
three of you an apology.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.158
Maybe not just us.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.500
Um. How do you feel
about a do over?

19:27.534 --> 19:30.270
I think that's a
wonderful idea.

19:30.303 --> 19:33.273
But maybe the older ponies
should sit this one out.

19:35.475 --> 19:37.744
**

19:37.777 --> 19:40.847
Thanks for helping us fix up our
carts. Pretty creative, right?

19:43.650 --> 19:46.953
I know it's not traditional, but
it sure looks fast, don't it?

19:49.289 --> 19:51.691
You know, darling, I can't
believe I'm saying this,

19:51.724 --> 19:54.594
but that yellow fringe
is rather bold after all!

19:56.863 --> 19:59.599
Thanks, everypony! We couldn't
have done it without you.

20:03.836 --> 20:05.905
Yup, I sure am glad
Ms. Cheerilee agreed

20:05.938 --> 20:07.440
to run the race over again.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.811
Well, it isn't every year I
get to say this twice, but...

20:11.844 --> 20:14.481
Derby Racers, to
the starting line!

20:14.514 --> 20:17.317
Derby Racers, to
the starting line!

20:20.453 --> 20:25.492
Racers, on your
marks, get set, go!

20:25.525 --> 20:28.895
[cheers] Whoo-hoo!

20:28.928 --> 20:31.331
And it's probably best
keeping all the grownups

20:31.364 --> 20:36.035
on the sidelines, but what
are we supposed to do now?

20:36.068 --> 20:38.671
I think I have an idea.

20:43.510 --> 20:47.480
Ah! Much better. Honestly,
I'm not sure why we wanted

20:47.514 --> 20:49.716
to race those carts
in the first place.

20:49.749 --> 20:54.721
Seriously! This is the most
relaxed I've been all day.

20:54.754 --> 20:58.558
[CHEERS]

20:58.591 --> 21:01.594
**

21:17.877 --> 21:22.482
GO SCOOTALOO! GO!
WHOO-WHOO-WHOO-WHOO!

21:22.515 --> 21:28.054
Er, I mean... this is the
life. Right, ponies?

21:28.921 --> 21:30.523
Ah!
