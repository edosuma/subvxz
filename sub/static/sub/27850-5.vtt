HOW ARE YOU?

08:23.666 --> 08:24.233
>> GOOD.

08:24.299 --> 08:26.666
>> I THINK YOU KNOW THIS GUY.

08:26.733 --> 08:27.433
>> I DO.

08:27.500 --> 08:28.933
CONGRESSMAN, GOOD TO SEE YOU

08:29.000 --> 08:31.566
AGAIN, SIR.

08:31.633 --> 08:33.199
>> IF YOU WERE RUNNING THE SHOW,

08:33.266 --> 08:35.600
WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND?

08:35.666 --> 08:37.067
>> IN SHORT, THE WALL IN SOME

08:37.133 --> 08:38.000
FORM OR FASHION.

08:38.067 --> 08:40.299
NOW, WE'VE HAD THOUSANDS OF

08:40.366 --> 08:41.366
ADDITIONAL AGENTS PLACED AT THE

08:41.433 --> 08:43.067
BORDER OVER THE YEARS, BUT

08:43.133 --> 08:44.033
THEY'RE STILL COMING AND NOT

08:44.100 --> 08:45.566
JUST THE ALIENS LOOKING FOR

08:45.633 --> 08:46.466
WORK, THE CRIMINAL ORGANIZATIONS

08:46.533 --> 08:48.833
THAT ARE TRAFFICKING THEM.

08:48.900 --> 08:49.800
THERE ARE NARCOTICS INVOLVED.

08:49.867 --> 08:51.166
IT HASN'T STOPPED.

08:51.233 --> 08:52.166
>> THEY WANT PEOPLE TO REALIZE

08:52.233 --> 08:53.967
WHEN THEY SAY, ALL WE NEED IS

08:54.033 --> 08:56.133
TECHNOLOGY, WALLS ARE MEDIEVAL,

08:56.199 --> 08:57.166
WHAT YOU'RE REALLY SAYING IS

08:57.233 --> 08:58.600
YOU'RE ASKING BORDER PATROL

08:58.666 --> 09:01.133
AGENTS TO THEN CHASE PEOPLE

09:01.199 --> 09:02.666
AROUND, WHEREAS WHAT THEY WOULD

09:02.733 --> 09:04.067
LIKE IS TO HAVE A BARRIER TO AT

09:04.133 --> 09:04.666
LEAST SLOW THE FLOW OF PEOPLE

09:04.733 --> 09:08.533
IN.

09:08.600 --> 09:11.299
>> I AM JUST AMAZED THAT WE

09:11.366 --> 09:14.466
CAN'T COMMUNICATE WELL ENOUGH TO

09:14.533 --> 09:15.867
HAVE EVERYONE SEE WHY WE NEED

09:15.933 --> 09:18.199
THIS WALL.

09:18.266 --> 09:18.766
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THAT

09:18.833 --> 09:19.399
MESSAGE ISN'T GETTING THROUGH.

09:19.466 --> 09:21.900
>> UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE A

09:21.967 --> 09:22.633
PRETTY GOOD IDEA AS TO WHY WE

09:22.700 --> 09:23.366
CAN'T DO IT.

09:23.433 --> 09:25.800
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE THE OTHER

09:25.867 --> 09:26.533
SIDE TRULY HATES THE PRESIDENT.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.033
I THINK THEY HATE EVERYTHING HE

09:28.100 --> 09:28.566
STOOD FOR.

09:28.633 --> 09:29.833
I THINK THEY'RE ANGRY ABOUT THE

09:29.900 --> 09:30.533
ELECTION STILL.

09:30.600 --> 09:31.933
THE PRESIDENT STATES HIS CASE IN

09:32.000 --> 09:32.967
A PRETTY BIG WAY.

09:33.033 --> 09:38.233
>> PERHAPS OVERSTATES IT

09:38.299 --> 09:38.500
SOMETIMES?

09:38.566 --> 09:38.833
>> SOMETIMES.

09:38.900 --> 09:39.533
I FULLY ADMIT THAT BUT IT

09:39.600 --> 09:42.100
DOESN'T MAKE HIM WRONG.

09:42.166 --> 09:47.100
>> LEGAL CHALLENGES ARE ALREADY

09:47.166 --> 09:47.666
MOUNTING AGAINST PRESIDENT

09:47.733 --> 09:49.100
TRUMP'S NATIONAL EMERGENCY TO

09:49.166 --> 09:51.766
BUILD HIS BORDER WALL.

09:51.833 --> 09:53.833
>> 16 STATES FILING SUIT CALLING

09:53.900 --> 09:58.500
THE EMERGENCY DECLARATION

09:58.566 --> 09:58.900
UNCONSTITUTIONAL.

09:58.967 --> 09:59.533
>> MANY ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING

09:59.600 --> 10:00.900
THE ACLU.

10:00.967 --> 10:02.166
>> THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS

10:02.233 --> 10:03.733
MAKING A CASE THAT THERE'S A

10:03.800 --> 10:05.433
CRISES ON THE U.S.-MEXICO

10:05.500 --> 10:05.933
BORDER.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.900
WE'RE AT THE ACLU AND THEY'RE

10:10.967 --> 10:12.533
SAYING THERE'S A CRISES BUT IT'S

10:12.600 --> 10:13.933
NOT ABOUT MIGRANTS COMING OVER

10:14.000 --> 10:15.433
BUT ABOUT THE CHILDREN WHO ARE

10:15.500 --> 10:16.833
SEPARATED FROM THEIR FAMILIES.

10:16.900 --> 10:19.867
>> HOW MANY IMMIGRATION-SPECIFIC

10:19.933 --> 10:20.967
LAWSUITS DO YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW?

10:21.033 --> 10:22.867
>> LAST I HEARD WE HAD 83 BUT

10:22.933 --> 10:24.199
THAT WAS TWO WEEKS AGO AND I

10:24.266 --> 10:25.266
THINK WE'VE FILED MORE.

10:25.333 --> 10:27.266
>> A LOT CAN HAPPEN IN TWO

10:27.333 --> 10:27.500
WEEKS.

10:27.566 --> 10:28.366
>> I DON'T THINK THERE'S BEEN A

10:28.433 --> 10:28.867
SINGLE WEEK THAT'S BEEN

10:28.933 --> 10:33.800
UNEVENTFUL.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.500
>> YOU ARE THE LAWYER THAT HAS

10:35.566 --> 10:37.500
BEEN WORKING ON THIS CASE SINCE

10:37.566 --> 10:38.533
IT FIRST WENT TO COURT.

10:38.600 --> 10:39.800
>> RIGHT.

10:39.867 --> 10:41.867
WE'RE COMING UP ON THE ONE-YEAR

10:41.933 --> 10:42.800
ANNIVERSARY IN A WEEK.

10:42.867 --> 10:44.133
WHEN WE FOUND OUT ABOUT FAMILY

10:44.199 --> 10:45.199
SEPARATIONS WE WENT TO COURT.

10:45.266 --> 10:49.366
THE COURT SAID THIS IS BRUTAL

10:49.433 --> 10:50.900
AND OFFENSIVE, SHOCKS THE

10:50.967 --> 10:51.199
CONSCIENCE.

10:51.266 --> 10:52.666
NOW IT'S WORSE THAN WE THOUGHT.

10:52.733 --> 10:55.000
THE GOVERNMENT HAS REPORTED 2700

10:55.067 --> 10:56.900
KIDS, THERE MAYBE THOUSANDS OF

10:56.967 --> 10:58.500
MORE FAMILIES SEPARATED THAT

10:58.566 --> 10:59.100
WERE NEVER DISCLOSED TO US OR

10:59.166 --> 11:02.633
THE COURT.

11:02.700 --> 11:05.299
WHAT WE KNEW IS THAT THEY WERE

11:05.366 --> 11:06.466
SEPARATING FAMILIES BEFORE THE

11:06.533 --> 11:08.133
FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF ZERO

11:08.199 --> 11:09.466
TOLERANCE BY ATTORNEY GENERAL

11:09.533 --> 11:10.867
SESSIONS, BUT WE DIDN'T KNOW THE

11:10.933 --> 11:11.100
SCOPE.

11:11.166 --> 11:14.299
>> IF YOU CROSS THE BORDER

11:14.366 --> 11:16.067
UNLAWFULLY, THEN WE WILL

11:16.133 --> 11:17.500
PROSECUTE YOU.

11:17.566 --> 11:18.933
THAT CHILD MAY BE SEPARATED FROM

11:19.000 --> 11:21.466
YOU AS REQUIRED BY LAW.

11:21.533 --> 11:24.067
>> THE GOVERNMENT WAS SEPARATING

11:24.133 --> 11:27.967
CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENTS

11:28.033 --> 11:28.366
MONTHS BEFORE --

11:28.433 --> 11:28.700
>> EXACTLY.

11:28.766 --> 11:30.266
>> -- THEY SAID THEY STARTED

11:30.333 --> 11:30.566
SEPARATING.

11:30.633 --> 11:32.067
>> EXACTLY.

11:32.133 --> 11:33.433
AND THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE

11:33.500 --> 11:34.900
WAS ALMOST MORE SHOCKING THAN

11:34.967 --> 11:35.266
THE REPORT.

11:35.333 --> 11:36.800
IT SAID WE KNOW THAT THERE MAY

11:36.867 --> 11:37.933
BE THOUSANDS OF KIDS.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.133
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE.

11:39.199 --> 11:40.500
WE DON'T HAVE A TRACKING SYSTEM.

11:40.566 --> 11:41.700
WE'D HAVE TO GO THROUGH

11:41.766 --> 11:42.333
INDIVIDUAL FILES AND THAT'S NOT

11:42.399 --> 11:45.067
WORTH IT.

11:45.133 --> 11:47.600
I AM FLYING OUT TO SAN DIEGO

11:47.666 --> 11:49.366
TONIGHT TO ASK THE COURT TO

11:49.433 --> 11:51.733
AUDIT THE GOVERNMENT, GIVE US

11:51.800 --> 11:53.533
THE INFORMATION AND WE WILL TAKE

11:53.600 --> 11:56.633
IT UPON OURSELVES TO FIND --

11:56.700 --> 11:57.566
>> YOU, THE ACLU.

11:57.633 --> 12:00.067
>> YES, WITH OUR PARTNERS.

12:00.133 --> 12:01.033
WE WILL CALL THE PARENT, CALL

12:01.100 --> 12:02.566
THE CHILD'S LAWYER, CHILD

12:02.633 --> 12:02.833
SERVICES.

12:02.900 --> 12:03.366
WE HAVE TO REUNITE THESE

12:03.433 --> 12:05.566
FAMILIES.

12:05.633 --> 12:07.366
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POTENTIALLY

12:07.433 --> 12:08.366
3 AND 4-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN NEVER

12:08.433 --> 12:12.333
SEEING THEIR PARENTS AGAIN.

12:12.399 --> 12:17.266
>> THE WHITE HOUSE IS MOVING

12:17.333 --> 12:17.833
FORWARD WITH PLANS TO SHIFT

12:17.900 --> 12:18.299
FEDERAL FUNDS FOR THE

12:18.366 --> 12:20.566
PRESIDENT'S DESIRE FOR A WALL.

12:20.633 --> 12:23.000
>> PUSHING BACK ON THE NATIONAL

12:23.067 --> 12:24.299
EMERGENCY DECLARATION.

12:24.366 --> 12:26.067
>> WE HAVE A MAJOR CRISES IN

12:26.133 --> 12:26.399
THIS COUNTRY.

12:26.466 --> 12:28.199
WE HAVE TO PAY MORE ATTENTION TO

12:28.266 --> 12:28.700
RURAL AMERICA.

12:28.766 --> 12:31.399
>> STAGGERING NEW STATISTIC, A

12:31.466 --> 12:33.067
VERY GRIM PICTURE OF THE OPIOID

12:33.133 --> 12:33.299
CRISES.

12:33.366 --> 12:34.967
>> AVERAGE DAY, 130 AMERICANS

12:35.033 --> 12:35.166
DIE.

12:35.233 --> 12:36.500
>> WE HAVE GOT TO CALL DRUG

12:36.566 --> 12:39.433
ADDICTION WHAT IT IS, A NATIONAL

12:39.500 --> 12:43.733
PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY.

12:43.800 --> 12:46.566
>> WHILE THERE'S A LOT OF CRISES

12:46.633 --> 12:48.600
IN AMERICA RIGHT NOW, THE OPIOID

12:48.666 --> 12:50.100
EPIDEMIC IS PERHAPS THE MOST

12:50.166 --> 12:50.333
DEADLY.

12:50.399 --> 12:52.433
HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE OPIOIDS

12:52.500 --> 12:53.800
ARE KILLING MORE PEOPLE PER

12:53.867 --> 12:55.800
CAPITA THAN ALMOST ANY OTHER

12:55.867 --> 12:56.033
STATE.

12:56.100 --> 12:56.967
>> YOU'RE ON THE SCHEDULE FOR

12:57.033 --> 12:57.199
TODAY.

12:57.266 --> 12:58.233
>> THIS IS THE FRONT LINES, THIS

12:58.299 --> 13:01.166
IS WHERE DOCTORS ARE LITERALLY

13:01.233 --> 13:01.666
SAVING LIVES EVERY DAY.

13:01.733 --> 13:03.867
>> IMAGINE IF 130 AMERICANS WERE

13:03.933 --> 13:06.133
DYING IN A WAR EVERY DAY, SO IT

13:06.199 --> 13:08.166
TOOK US A WHILE TO REALIZE HOW

13:08.233 --> 13:10.633
BIG THIS CRISES WAS.

13:10.700 --> 13:13.399
I THINK WE SAW 40, 50 PATIENTS

13:13.466 --> 13:14.399
JUST IN THE MORNING AND THAT'S

13:14.466 --> 13:16.466
ABOUT WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY.

13:16.533 --> 13:18.800
>> HOW MANY OF THOSE PATIENTS

13:18.867 --> 13:20.100
ARE DRUG RELATED?

13:20.166 --> 13:21.233
>> EVERY ONE OF THEM.

13:21.299 --> 13:21.633
>> OH WOW, REALLY?

13:21.700 --> 13:26.166
WOW.

13:26.233 --> 13:28.100
>> EVERY TOWN, EVERY CITY READS

13:28.166 --> 13:29.466
ABOUT IT IN THE NEWSPAPER.

13:29.533 --> 13:30.466
IT'S A YOUNG PERSON.

13:30.533 --> 13:32.067
YOU SEE THE PICTURE.

13:32.133 --> 13:33.067
NO CAUSE OF DEATH IS LISTED.

13:33.133 --> 13:37.566
IT'S AN OVERDOSE.

13:37.633 --> 13:39.133
WHEN FENTANYL HIT, THAT'S WHEN

13:39.199 --> 13:40.133
THE CRISES HIT.

13:40.199 --> 13:42.233
>> BECAUSE FENTANYL IS THAT MUCH

13:42.299 --> 13:42.833
MORE POWERFUL?

13:42.900 --> 13:44.933
>> IT'S 100 TIMES MORE POWERFUL

13:45.000 --> 13:46.000
THAN HEROIN.

13:46.067 --> 13:47.700
YOUR BRAIN IS SCREAMING FOR THEM

13:47.766 --> 13:49.500
ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE.

13:49.566 --> 13:50.900
MOMS WILL BREAK BONDS OF NATURE.

13:50.967 --> 13:53.466
THEY WON'T FEED THEIR CHILD.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.500
IMAGINE HOW MUCH THAT CRAVING IS

13:55.566 --> 13:58.100
FOR YOU TO IGNORE YOUR OWN

13:58.166 --> 14:00.867
OFFSPRING.

14:00.933 --> 14:02.733
>> THERE WAS RARELY A DAY THAT

14:02.800 --> 14:04.600
WENT BY IN MY FIRST MONTHS OF

14:04.666 --> 14:05.700
GOVERNOR WHERE I WASN'T TALKING

14:05.766 --> 14:07.466
TO A FAMILY THAT LOST SOMEBODY,

14:07.533 --> 14:08.433
WASN'T VISITING A TREATMENT

14:08.500 --> 14:08.666
CENTER.

14:08.733 --> 14:09.433
>> EVERY DAY YOU WERE DEALING

14:09.500 --> 14:10.333
WITH IT.

14:10.399 --> 14:11.867
>> EVERY DAY, EVERY SINGLE DAY.

14:11.933 --> 14:18.733
AND IT WAS NEVER GOOD NEWS.

14:18.800 --> 14:19.733
WE'RE SEEING LEVELS OF

14:19.800 --> 14:20.067
ADDICTION.

14:20.133 --> 14:21.466
WE'RE SEEING CRIMES IN AREAS

14:21.533 --> 14:23.100
THAT WE HADN'T SEEN IT BEFORE.

14:23.166 --> 14:24.666
WE'RE SEEING SENIORS BECOME

14:24.733 --> 14:24.933
ADDICTED.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.533
THEY GOT A KNEE REPLACEMENT AT

14:27.600 --> 14:29.666
65, WERE ADDICTED TO OPIOIDS BY

14:29.733 --> 14:32.867
68 AND SHOOTING HEROIN BY 70.

14:32.933 --> 14:35.000
WE WERE ONE OF THE FIRST ONES TO

14:35.067 --> 14:37.800
REALLY FALL INTO THIS CRISES.

14:37.867 --> 14:38.466
WE DIDN'T HAVE INFRASTRUCTURE IN

14:38.533 --> 14:39.666
PLACE AND ULTIMATELY RURAL

14:39.733 --> 14:42.000
ACCESS TO CARE IS THE GREATEST

14:42.067 --> 14:43.100
UNSPOKEN BARRIER.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.433
WE HAVE SOME AREAS THAT DIDN'T

14:44.500 --> 14:45.466
HAVE TREATMENT CENTERS BEFORE

14:45.533 --> 14:47.067
THIS NEW MODEL CAME INTO PLACE.

14:47.133 --> 14:48.800
IN MY MIND I SAID I DON'T WANT

14:48.867 --> 14:49.833
ANYONE TO HAVE TO DRIVE MORE

14:49.900 --> 14:51.933
THAN 45 MINUTES FROM THEIR HOME.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.366
WHAT'S THE RESULT?

14:53.433 --> 14:55.333
THE REST OF THE COUNTRY SAW A

14:55.399 --> 14:56.366
10% INCREASE.

14:56.433 --> 14:58.033
WE SAW A 10% DECREASE.

14:58.100 --> 14:59.700
>> AS YOU SEE THIS PUBLIC HEALTH

14:59.766 --> 15:00.933
CRISES AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT

15:01.000 --> 15:02.366
DIFFERENT PRIORITIES THAT YOU'RE

15:02.433 --> 15:03.299
DEALING WITH AND THE COUNTRY IS

15:03.366 --> 15:05.067
DEALING WITH, WHAT'S YOUR

15:05.133 --> 15:06.700
REACTION TO THE BORDER CRISES?

15:06.766 --> 15:08.366
>> I THINK BORDER SECURITY IS AN

15:08.433 --> 15:09.500
EMERGENCY AND I THINK, AGAIN,

15:09.566 --> 15:10.700
GIVEN WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

15:10.766 --> 15:13.100
TODAY WITH THE DRUG CRISES, IT

15:13.166 --> 15:14.666
HAS A DIRECT EFFECT.

15:14.733 --> 15:16.299
THESE DRUGS COME OVER THIS

15:16.366 --> 15:17.867
BORDER IN DROVES AND IT HAS A

15:17.933 --> 15:19.100
DIRECT EFFECT ON THE LIVES,

15:19.166 --> 15:20.766
HEALTH AND WELL-BEING OF THE

15:20.833 --> 15:23.733
CITIZENS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE SO I

15:23.800 --> 15:26.533
TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.266
>> IS IT RISING TO THE LEVEL OF

15:28.333 --> 15:28.500
CRISES?

15:28.566 --> 15:29.967
>> YES, IT'S A CRISES.

IS FACING.

16:34.366 --> 16:35.000
EVERYONE IN THE WORLD HAS BEEN

16:35.067 --> 16:36.067
WAITING FOR THE MUELLER REPORT

16:36.133 --> 16:39.700

16:39.766 --> 16:40.666
REPORT IS TO BE BELIEVED THIS

16:40.733 --> 16:44.766
INVESTIGATION MAY NOW BE OVER.

16:44.833 --> 16:46.733
THERE'S A NEW BOOK CALLED

16:46.800 --> 16:49.333
"THREAT" BY ANDY McCABE, FORMER

16:49.399 --> 16:50.933
ACTING DIRECTOR OF THE FBI.

16:51.000 --> 16:53.433
IT HAS AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF

16:53.500 --> 16:55.933
SHOCKING ALLEGATIONS IN IT.

16:56.000 --> 16:59.433
>> McCABE AND OTHERS EXPLORED

16:59.500 --> 17:00.133
THE POSSIBILITY THE PRESIDENT

17:00.199 --> 17:01.566
WAS WORKING AS A RUSSIAN AGENT.

17:01.633 --> 17:03.633
>> WE'RE HERE TO TALK TO TWO

PEOPLE WHO ARE IN AS GOOD A

POSITION AS ANYONE TO ASSESS

17:06.733 --> 17:07.399
DONALD TRUMP'S LIFE IN THE LEGAL

17:07.466 --> 17:10.700
AND POLITICAL REALM.

17:10.766 --> 17:12.766
SO YOU THINK THAT ANDY McCABE'S

17:12.833 --> 17:16.000
MOTIVATION FOR WRITING THIS BOOK

17:16.067 --> 17:16.266
WAS WHAT?

17:16.333 --> 17:16.833
>> MY UNDERSTANDING FROM

17:16.900 --> 17:17.867
SPEAKING TO HIM IS THAT HE IS

17:17.933 --> 17:18.867
GETTING OUT THIS STUFF BECAUSE

17:18.933 --> 17:21.633
HE WANTS TO SHOW THAT EVEN THE

17:21.700 --> 17:22.233
TOP LEVEL OF THE DOJ WAS THIS

17:22.299 --> 17:27.466
CONCERNED.

17:27.533 --> 17:30.266
>> FBI AGENTS ARE TRAINED TO

17:30.333 --> 17:31.633
IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE THREATS.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.800
ANDY McCABE HAS DECIDED, SEEING

17:33.867 --> 17:36.766
A THREAT, IDENTIFYING IT IS NOW

17:36.833 --> 17:40.133
SOUNDING THE ALARM PUBLICLY.

17:40.199 --> 17:43.033
WRITING A BOOK, IT'S COUNTER

17:43.100 --> 17:44.833
INTUITIVE TO THE SECRECY WITH

17:44.900 --> 17:49.299
WHICH COUNTER INTELLIGENCE WORK

17:49.366 --> 17:50.100
HAPPENS BUT SOMETIMES YOU HAVE

17:50.166 --> 17:51.333
TO SOUND THE ALARM AND I THINK

17:51.399 --> 17:53.433
THIS IS ANDY SOUNDING THE ALARM.

17:53.500 --> 17:54.633
>> THE IDEA THAT THE PRESIDENT

17:54.700 --> 17:56.433
MIGHT BE COMPROMISED BY THE

17:56.500 --> 17:58.033
RUSSIANS, IT'S SO OUT OF

17:58.100 --> 17:58.633
ANYTHING WE CAN POSSIBLY

17:58.700 --> 17:58.900
IMAGINE.

17:58.967 --> 18:01.100
>> IT WAS THAT SIMILAR LACK OF

18:01.166 --> 18:03.067
CREATIVITY THAT GOT US INTO

18:03.133 --> 18:03.299
9/11.

18:03.366 --> 18:07.967
NO ONE COULD ENVISION FLYING

18:08.033 --> 18:08.633
FULL BLOWN COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

18:08.700 --> 18:09.633
INTO BUILDINGS AS A WEAPON.

18:09.700 --> 18:12.500
SO ANDY McCABE HAS DECIDED THAT

18:12.566 --> 18:13.967
THIS PRESIDENT IS SO

18:14.033 --> 18:15.833
ABERRATIONAL THAT WE NEED TO BE

18:15.900 --> 18:17.233
VERY CONCERNED THAT HE MIGHT BE

18:17.299 --> 18:17.867
COMPROMISED IN SOME WAY, SHAPE

18:17.933 --> 18:19.833
OR FORM.

18:19.900 --> 18:21.666
>> YOU ASKED HIM THE QUESTION,

18:21.733 --> 18:22.700
DO YOU THINK TRUMP IS STILL A

18:22.766 --> 18:23.800
TARGET OF THE MUELLER

18:23.867 --> 18:24.133
INVESTIGATION.

18:24.199 --> 18:25.299
IS THERE ANY REASON TO THINK

18:25.366 --> 18:26.299
HE'S NOT?

18:26.366 --> 18:27.366
AND HE SAID WHAT?

18:27.433 --> 18:29.333
>> HE SAID MUELLER HAS BEEN

18:29.399 --> 18:32.933
PURSUING THIS LIKE WE WOULD AN

18:33.000 --> 18:33.900
ORGANIZED CRIME SYNDICATE.

18:33.967 --> 18:35.433
HE'S WORKING HIS WAY TO THE TOP

18:35.500 --> 18:36.967
AND TRYING TO GET THE BIG FISH

18:37.033 --> 18:38.266
AND IT SEEMS LIKE IF TRUMP WERE

18:38.333 --> 18:39.867
NOT A TARGET THEN THE

18:39.933 --> 18:41.700
INVESTIGATION WOULD HAVE PURSUED

18:41.766 --> 18:42.399
IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY.

18:42.466 --> 18:45.133
>> CNN REPORTS TODAY THAT THE

18:45.199 --> 18:45.700
NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL MAY

18:45.766 --> 18:48.000
ANNOUNCE THAT THE MUELLER

18:48.067 --> 18:48.800
INVESTIGATION IS OVER AS EARLY

18:48.867 --> 18:49.700
AS NEXT WEEK.

18:49.766 --> 18:51.399
DO YOU CREDIT THIS REPORT?

18:51.466 --> 18:53.333
DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO YOU THAT

18:53.399 --> 18:55.500
THIS ALL COULD BE OVER NEXT

18:55.566 --> 18:55.700
WEEK?

18:55.766 --> 18:57.033
>> PEOPLE THAT HAVE WORKED ON

18:57.100 --> 18:58.166
THE RUSSIA INVESTIGATION WHO

18:58.233 --> 19:00.199
SPEAK TO ME WHO ARE NOW OUT,

19:00.266 --> 19:01.500
THEY SAY IT JUST DOESN'T REALLY

19:01.566 --> 19:02.133
MAKE SENSE.

19:02.199 --> 19:04.299
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

19:04.366 --> 19:06.067
IT SEEMS ANTICLIMACTIC.

19:06.133 --> 19:07.166
IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE THIS IS HOW

19:07.233 --> 19:08.233
IT'S GOING TO END.

19:08.299 --> 19:10.399
>> GIVEN THE WAY IN WHICH THIS

19:10.466 --> 19:11.666
HAS PROCEEDED, IT DOESN'T SEEM

19:11.733 --> 19:14.067
LIKE WE'RE AT THE END OF THE

19:14.133 --> 19:14.266
STORY.

19:14.333 --> 19:16.433
BIG NAMES HAVEN'T BEEN

19:16.500 --> 19:17.867
INTERVIEWED APPARENTLY, LET

19:17.933 --> 19:18.266
ALONE INDICTED.

19:18.333 --> 19:21.067
FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE IT FELT LIKE

19:21.133 --> 19:24.199
THE WALLS HAD BEEN CLOSING IN

19:24.266 --> 19:26.000
PROGRESSIVELY ON TRUMP.

19:26.067 --> 19:27.199
NOW THIS PIECE OF REPORTING

19:27.266 --> 19:27.900
COMES OUT.

19:27.967 --> 19:28.900
I THINK THERE ARE MILLIONS OF

19:28.967 --> 19:30.867
PEOPLE IN AMERICA AT NIGHT

19:30.933 --> 19:31.700
WONDERING, WAIT A MINUTE, WE

19:31.766 --> 19:32.800
THOUGHT WE KNEW THE WAY THE

19:32.867 --> 19:34.666
STORY WAS HEADED AND NOW IT

19:34.733 --> 19:38.900
SEEMS LIKE IT MIGHT NOT BE.

19:38.967 --> 19:40.233
>> DO YOU AT THIS MOMENT BELIEVE

19:40.299 --> 19:41.833
THAT JUSTICE WILL BE DONE?

19:41.900 --> 19:43.700
>> I THINK JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL.

19:43.766 --> 19:44.766
I THINK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND

19:44.833 --> 19:46.067
WHAT THE DEFINITION OF THAT

19:46.133 --> 19:46.967
LOOKS LIKE.

19:47.033 --> 19:48.366
IF PEOPLE HAVE SCENES IN THEIR

19:48.433 --> 19:51.067
HEAD OF THE PRESIDENT BEING

19:51.133 --> 19:51.600
HANDCUFF

19:51.666 --> 19:53.067
HANDCUFFED AND DRAGGED OUT OF

19:53.133 --> 19:55.166
THE OVAL OFFICE, THEY NEED TO

19:55.233 --> 19:56.566
LEVEL SET AND THEY NEED TO BE

19:56.633 --> 19:57.100
PREPARED FOR POSSIBLY NO

19:57.166 --> 20:02.600
INDICTMENT OF THE PRESIDENT.

20:02.666 --> 20:04.500
>> CRITICS OF THE PRESIDENT'S

20:04.566 --> 20:09.100
MOVE SAY THAT THERE ARE MORE

20:09.166 --> 20:09.666
URGENT ISSUES THAT COULD BE

20:09.733 --> 20:11.000
CONSIDERED NATIONAL EMERGENCIES.

20:11.067 --> 20:13.233
>> SINCE LAST THURSDAY --

20:13.299 --> 20:14.967
>> FRIDAY'S DEADLY SHOOTING IN

20:15.033 --> 20:15.600
ILLINOIS --

20:15.666 --> 20:17.067
>> IN CLINTON, MISSISSIPPI, A

20:17.133 --> 20:18.000
MAN SHOT AND KILLED FOUR

20:18.067 --> 20:18.633
PEOPLE --

20:18.700 --> 20:19.967
>> IN MICHIGAN POLICE ARE

20:20.033 --> 20:21.000
INVESTIGATING A SHOOTING THAT

20:21.067 --> 20:22.100
LEFT AT LEAST FOUR PEOPLE DEAD

20:22.166 --> 20:29.600
INCLUDING CHILDREN.

20:29.666 --> 20:30.666
>> WHEN THE PRESIDENT ANNOUNCED

20:30.733 --> 20:32.733
THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY LAST

20:32.800 --> 20:34.967
WEEK, PROMINENT STUDENT

20:35.033 --> 20:36.233
ACTIVISTS RAISED THEIR HANDS AND

20:36.299 --> 20:37.867
SAID IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

20:37.933 --> 20:38.566
NATIONAL EMERGENCIES IN THIS

20:38.633 --> 20:40.000
MOMENT, THE NUMBER ONE NATIONAL

20:40.067 --> 20:41.366
EMERGENCY IN THIS COUNTRY IS THE

20:41.433 --> 20:53.433
EPIDEMIC OF GUN VIOLENCE.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.600
>> GET THE MICROPHONES ON YOU.

20:55.666 --> 20:56.433
READY?

20:56.500 --> 20:57.067
>> YEAH.

20:57.133 --> 20:58.867
>> CURRENT LAWMAKERS, EXCEPT FOR

20:58.933 --> 21:00.366
A SELECT FEW WITHIN THE VERY

21:00.433 --> 21:02.366
YOUNG FRESHMAN CLASS IN

21:02.433 --> 21:04.466
CONGRESS, NEVER HAD TO LIVE IN

21:04.533 --> 21:05.067
FEAR OF GUN VIOLENCE WITHIN

21:05.133 --> 21:10.067
THEIR SCHOOL.

21:10.133 --> 21:12.900
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT

21:12.967 --> 21:14.133
PARKLAND IS THE SHOOTING THAT

21:14.199 --> 21:15.133
CHANGED THE WAY PEOPLE LOOKED AT

21:15.199 --> 21:20.533
GUN VIOLENCE.

21:20.600 --> 21:21.600
>> WHEN YOU GUYS HEARD THAT THE

21:21.666 --> 21:22.800
PRESIDENT WAS GOING TO CALL

21:22.867 --> 21:24.967
WHAT'S HAPPENING AT THE BORDER A

21:25.033 --> 21:26.100
NATIONAL EMERGENCY, WERE YOU

21:26.166 --> 21:28.000
ANGRY THAT HE WAS SAYING THIS IS

21:28.067 --> 21:29.133
THE THING THE COUNTRY NEEDS TO

21:29.199 --> 21:29.967
BE WORRIED ABOUT?

21:30.033 --> 21:31.800
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S ANGER.

21:31.867 --> 21:33.500
TALKING ABOUT THE BORDER, IT

21:33.566 --> 21:37.266
FEELS THAT HE IS SO FOCUSED ON

21:37.333 --> 21:38.333
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO

21:38.399 --> 21:39.633
COME INTO THIS COUNTRY THAT HE'S

21:39.700 --> 21:40.600
NOT FOCUSING ON THE PEOPLE THAT

21:40.666 --> 21:43.100
ARE ACTUALLY IN IT.

21:43.166 --> 21:45.566
>> HOW DO YOU CONVEY A SENSE OF

21:45.633 --> 21:47.366
URGENCY IF THIS IS ACTUALLY AN

21:47.433 --> 21:47.833
EMERGENCY?

21:47.900 --> 21:49.199
>> I THINK AFTER EVERY MASS

21:49.266 --> 21:51.233
SHOOTING WE NEED THE PEOPLE THAT

21:51.299 --> 21:52.867
SURVIVE TO GO OUT THERE AND TALK

21:52.933 --> 21:54.800
ABOUT IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

21:54.867 --> 21:56.299
BECAUSE ONLY WAITING AND NOT

21:56.366 --> 21:58.100
WANTING TO POLITICIZE SOMETHING

21:58.166 --> 21:59.500
IS WHAT IS GETTING PEOPLE

21:59.566 --> 21:59.733
KILLED.

21:59.800 --> 22:02.433
>> HOW DO YOU PRESERVE YOUR

22:02.500 --> 22:05.867
SENSE OF OUTRAGE ABOUT THIS?

22:05.933 --> 22:09.133
>> THE WRISTBANDS ON MY WRIST

22:09.199 --> 22:11.100
THAT USED TO BE PEOPLE.

22:11.166 --> 22:12.967
THE FACT THAT 14 STUDENTS AND 3

22:13.033 --> 22:15.133
TEACHERS DIED AT MY HIGH SCHOOL

22:15.199 --> 22:16.800
IN A TOWN THAT I HAVE LIVED IN

22:16.867 --> 22:18.466
MY ENTIRE LIFE BECAUSE I DIDN'T

22:18.533 --> 22:18.967
CARE ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE

22:19.033 --> 22:24.433
BEFOREHAND.

22:24.500 --> 22:26.500
>> THE CRIES THAT I HEARD OF MY

22:26.566 --> 22:28.833
SISTER THAT DAY, A 14-YEAR-OLD

22:28.900 --> 22:29.967
WHO HAD LOST FOUR FRIENDS ON THE

22:30.033 --> 22:32.033
SAME DAY AS A FRESHMAN IN HIGH

22:32.100 --> 22:32.266
SCHOOL.

22:32.333 --> 22:33.166
THIS MOVEMENT IS NOT GOING TO

22:33.233 --> 22:34.800
STOP UNTIL WE CHANGE THIS

22:34.867 --> 22:35.833
BECAUSE GUN VIOLENCE IS NOT

22:35.900 --> 22:37.433
GOING TO STOP UNTIL WE GET THE

22:37.500 --> 22:38.533
LAWS THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR.

22:38.600 --> 22:41.366
IF IT DOESN'T HAPPEN WITH THESE

22:41.433 --> 22:41.933
POLITICIANS, I CAN TELL YOU

22:42.000 --> 22:43.233
WE'RE LOSING ORGANIZERS IN MARCH

22:43.299 --> 22:44.500
FOR OUR LIVES BECAUSE THEY'RE

22:44.566 --> 22:46.433
ALL RUNNING FOR OFFICE.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.233
ALL OF THESE KIDS ARE FUTURE

22:48.299 --> 22:51.366
CONGRESSMEN AND WOMEN, FUTURE

22:51.433 --> 22:53.800
SENATORS, FUTURE STATE REPS,

22:53.867 --> 22:54.833
GOVERNORS AND FUTURE PRESIDENT.

22:54.900 --> 22:56.199
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW, IF THE

22:56.266 --> 22:57.600
CURRENT GENERATION IN POWER DOES

22:57.666 --> 22:58.967
NOT TAKE ACTION ON THIS ISSUE,

22:59.033 --> 23:00.100
WE WILL BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING

23:00.166 --> 23:02.833
TO LET OUR KIDS LIVE IN FEAR OF

23:02.900 --> 23:07.333
GUN VIOLENCE IN ANY ZIP CODE.

24:22.833 --> 24:24.800
SHINING A LIGHT ON THIS ISSUE

24:24.867 --> 24:25.333
THAN ANYTHING.

STUNT.

26:15.900 --> 26:16.867
COURT CHALLENGE, PARTICULARLY

26:16.933 --> 26:17.833
SINCE HE SAID IN HIS

27:13.533 --> 27:15.433
THE ESTIMATES ARE THAT IN THIS

27:15.500 --> 27:17.633
CENTURY THERE COULD BE AS MANY

27:17.700 --> 27:21.867
AS 1 BILLION CLIMATE REFUGEES

MIGRATING ACROSS BORDERS TO
