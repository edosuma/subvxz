WEBVTT

00:02.301 --> 00:04.035
With just the tip
of your brush.

00:04.035 --> 00:06.204
That way, you'll end up
with a beautiful finish,

00:06.205 --> 00:08.406
Just like on this
american walnut cabinet.

00:08.407 --> 00:11.810
Tim, it's not american walnut,
it's english walnut.

00:11.811 --> 00:14.545
Wrong-o, al.
That's american walnut.

00:14.546 --> 00:16.581
I don't think so, tim.

00:16.582 --> 00:18.382
Pardon me.

00:18.383 --> 00:20.118
<i>(sniffs)</i>

00:22.054 --> 00:24.789
English walnut.

00:24.790 --> 00:27.325
<i>(sniffs)</i>

00:29.294 --> 00:31.295
American bearded nut.

00:33.766 --> 00:36.267
I've trained myself
to distinguish wood

00:36.268 --> 00:38.269
Not only by sight
and feel,

00:38.270 --> 00:39.938
But also by smell.

00:39.939 --> 00:43.842
And smelling wood must come in
real handy at parties, huh?

00:43.843 --> 00:46.511
As a matter of fact,
tim, it does.

00:46.512 --> 00:48.780
If you're a beaver.

00:48.781 --> 00:51.783
If you were lost in the forest
in the middle of the night,

00:51.784 --> 00:53.618
You'd be grateful
for this talent,

00:53.619 --> 00:55.920
Because you could sniff
your way back to safety.

00:55.921 --> 00:58.489
Or you can buy
a cellular phone.

00:58.490 --> 01:00.859
What's with you, anyway?

01:00.860 --> 01:03.862
Well, tim, all I can say
is if push came to shove,

01:03.863 --> 01:07.198
I believe I could
identify wood blindfolded.

01:07.199 --> 01:08.533
Well...

01:08.534 --> 01:10.535
Maybe the audience
would like to see

01:10.536 --> 01:13.104
A little demonstration
of al's wood-sniffing
skills, huh?

01:13.105 --> 01:14.305
<i>(all)</i> yeah!

01:18.811 --> 01:20.812
Ok, then,
on the next <i>tool time,</i>

01:20.813 --> 01:25.183
We'll put
al "nostrils" borland
to the test.

01:25.184 --> 01:27.218
For now, the <i>tool time</i>
tip of the day...

01:27.219 --> 01:30.221
Don't inhale the varnish
and definitely don't drink it.

01:30.222 --> 01:33.758
It'd be a sad end,
but a beautiful finish.

01:33.759 --> 01:36.127
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
See you next time.

02:49.601 --> 02:52.036
Well, what do you think?
Could we put the kids
in the middle?

02:55.107 --> 02:56.174
This is perfect.

02:56.175 --> 02:58.609
This is how
we can get the mcgurns.

02:58.610 --> 03:00.211
The mcgurn boys
are poopheads.

03:00.212 --> 03:01.813
What happened to you?

03:01.814 --> 03:04.149
They got mad that you
threw mud balls at 'em,

03:04.150 --> 03:06.284
So they made me
into "mud man."

03:06.285 --> 03:07.418
Don't worry.

03:07.419 --> 03:09.087
We're gonna
get 'em back good.

03:09.088 --> 03:10.255
Look at this.

03:10.256 --> 03:11.489
What is it?

03:11.490 --> 03:13.958
It's a catapult.
Look at the picture.

03:13.959 --> 03:17.162
In middle ages,
when you wanted to storm
an enemy's castle,

03:17.163 --> 03:19.164
You'd get and dead
and diseased horse

03:19.165 --> 03:21.632
And fling it
over the castle walls.

03:23.035 --> 03:25.970
We don't have a dead horse.

03:25.971 --> 03:30.574
Hey, maybe we can get
mrs. Bauscher's dog.

03:31.911 --> 03:33.511
He's not dead.

03:33.512 --> 03:36.580
Well, almost.

03:36.581 --> 03:39.550
We just need something
that stinks.

03:42.087 --> 03:45.223
I don't stink.

03:45.224 --> 03:46.858
Garbage.

03:46.859 --> 03:48.860
We could build
one of those things

03:48.861 --> 03:51.196
And fling it into
the back of mcgurns' yard.

03:51.197 --> 03:53.965
All right. Yes!

03:53.966 --> 03:57.568
Oh, no. What are you
doing now?

03:57.569 --> 04:01.239
I souped up
the weed whacker, baby.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.074
I thought
you bought that one

04:03.075 --> 04:05.409
'cause it was
the most powerful one
in the store.

04:05.410 --> 04:07.578
Now it's
the most powerful one
on the planet.

04:07.579 --> 04:09.580
I put a little
mini-turbo in here.

04:09.581 --> 04:11.916
I think I can get
this 2-cycle motor
up to 33,000 rpms.

04:11.917 --> 04:14.886
Just call me robowhacker.

04:16.322 --> 04:19.257
Excuse me, mr. Whacker.
Huh?

04:19.257 --> 04:21.326
There are no weeds in November.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.828
I know that.
I'm just gonna do
a little trial spin

04:23.829 --> 04:25.696
Before I put it to sleep
for winter.

04:25.697 --> 04:28.099
<i>(doorbell rings)</i>

04:32.238 --> 04:35.073
Karen! Dave!
Dave and karen,
happy couple.

04:35.074 --> 04:36.607
Hi. Whoops.

04:36.608 --> 04:38.609
You want some coffee
or something?

04:38.610 --> 04:40.945
Yes. Yes.
Where's tim?

04:40.946 --> 04:44.282
Oh, he's outside trying
some new weed whacker thing.

04:44.283 --> 04:47.385
<i>(weed whacker</i>
<i>buzzing)</i>

04:54.559 --> 04:58.229
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Ha-ha-ha.

04:58.230 --> 04:59.463
Whoo!

05:04.636 --> 05:06.804
Now, that's whacki''
some weeds. Dave!

05:06.805 --> 05:08.806
Hey, tim.
How you doin',
buddy?

05:08.807 --> 05:09.807
Nice slacks.

05:09.808 --> 05:11.009
Karen.

05:11.010 --> 05:12.810
Nice legs,
chicken little.

05:12.811 --> 05:14.145
Thanks, mouth big.

05:14.146 --> 05:15.646
What are you guys
doing over here?

05:15.647 --> 05:18.283
We're going
to the opera tonight.

05:18.284 --> 05:20.285
Aah!

05:20.286 --> 05:22.287
Jill, I need to borrow
your opera glasses.

05:22.288 --> 05:24.289
Ok. Which one
are you gonna see?

05:24.290 --> 05:26.590
<i>La boheme.</i>

05:26.591 --> 05:27.792
<i>La boheme?</i>

05:27.793 --> 05:29.360
Yeah, <i>la boheme.</i>

05:29.361 --> 05:30.561
The bohemian.

05:30.562 --> 05:32.830
It's a very
romantic opera.

05:32.831 --> 05:35.466
But they're
a very romantic couple,
just as I knew they would be

05:35.467 --> 05:37.201
When I first
set them up.

05:37.202 --> 05:41.072
Hey, tim,
why don't you guys
come and join us tonight?

05:41.073 --> 05:45.043
Dandy idea, dave,
but I'm married now.

05:45.044 --> 05:48.046
You only have to go through that
opera hell when you're dating.

05:48.047 --> 05:50.949
Ok. Mr. Cynic.

05:50.950 --> 05:52.783
Goes both way,
kar-kar.

05:52.784 --> 05:53.952
You're dating.

05:53.953 --> 05:56.020
You pretend you like
football, don't you?

05:56.021 --> 05:58.689
It just so happens
that I really like
football.

05:58.690 --> 06:01.859
Just last weekend,
we curled up on the couch
and watched a whole game.

06:01.860 --> 06:04.862
Really? Who played?
Don't say anything.
Who played the game?

06:04.863 --> 06:07.631
It was that team
that has the animal name,

06:07.632 --> 06:11.069
And they were playing opposite
that team with the quarterback

06:11.070 --> 06:13.404
With the really long hair
and the high cheekbones.

06:13.405 --> 06:14.939
Maraschino.
Marino.

06:14.940 --> 06:17.308
Marinovich.
Right. Yeah.

06:17.309 --> 06:18.977
Very hunky guy.
Very hunky.

06:18.978 --> 06:20.979
You know
what I like
about football.

06:20.980 --> 06:23.948
What's that?
<i>(both)</i> the butts.

06:23.949 --> 06:25.783
They get in that circle
and cuddle.

06:25.784 --> 06:28.319
They <i>huddle</i> in the circle.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.321
Tim, why don't you
come show me

06:30.322 --> 06:32.290
This new weed whacker,
all right?

06:32.291 --> 06:33.391
Who else is cute?

06:36.895 --> 06:39.130
What is this?

06:39.131 --> 06:41.366
You never seen
a professional football before?

06:41.367 --> 06:42.700
<i>(laughs)</i>

06:42.701 --> 06:44.602
Needs air.

06:44.603 --> 06:48.139
Listen, tim, um,
I need a favor from you.

06:48.140 --> 06:49.207
Name it, buddy.

06:49.208 --> 06:51.775
You and I had lunch
together yesterday.

06:51.776 --> 06:53.944
I was at the project house
all day.

06:53.945 --> 06:55.946
Yeah, I know you were,
but, um,

06:55.947 --> 06:58.749
If karen asks, you and I
had lunch together.
Ohh...

06:58.750 --> 07:00.451
It's a tiny favor, tim.

07:00.452 --> 07:02.453
It's not a tiny favor.
This is a major favor.

07:02.454 --> 07:04.022
Karen is jill's best friend.

07:04.023 --> 07:06.024
I-I don't think
I should know about this.

07:06.025 --> 07:08.626
All right,
all right, all right.

07:08.627 --> 07:11.229
I'm seeing someone else.
I don't want
to hear about this.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.097
She's very nice.
I don't want
to know her.

07:13.098 --> 07:14.598
She's tall,
she's blond...

07:14.599 --> 07:16.901
Come on,
dave, dave, dave...

07:16.902 --> 07:18.903
I don't see
what the big deal is.

07:18.904 --> 07:20.905
I've only been dating karen
for a month.

07:20.906 --> 07:23.574
She'll think it's a big deal.
She's single and over 35.

07:23.575 --> 07:26.444
Do you know what a month is
in ovarian years?

07:26.445 --> 07:27.711
<i>(door opens)</i>

07:27.712 --> 07:29.180
Dave, we gotta get going.

07:29.181 --> 07:31.182
We don't want to be late
for that opera.

07:31.183 --> 07:32.783
Be right there, honey.

07:32.784 --> 07:34.618
<i>(sighs)</i>
<i>(door closes)</i>

07:34.619 --> 07:37.621
Tim, you gotta help me out.
I don't want to hurt karen.

07:37.622 --> 07:39.457
Then stop dating
tall blondes.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.992
Look, I gotta be honest
with you.

07:41.993 --> 07:45.263
I already told her
that I had lunch
with you yesterday,

07:45.264 --> 07:46.864
So it may come up.
What?

07:46.865 --> 07:49.367
Look, boxing cat grill,
ham and cheese on rye,
extra mustard.

07:49.368 --> 07:51.035
Dave, wait a minute.
Dave, dave.

07:51.036 --> 07:58.509
Come here, come here.
David. Dave.

07:58.510 --> 07:59.777
Wilson?

07:59.778 --> 08:02.213
Hi-de-ho, neighbor.

08:02.214 --> 08:03.914
What are you, over there
eavesdropping, huh?

08:03.915 --> 08:06.417
Oh, heavens no.

08:06.418 --> 08:08.819
Just giving myself
a little haircut.

08:08.820 --> 08:11.556
You know, wilson, I was thinking
about friends today.

08:11.557 --> 08:14.459
You mean
ol' two-timer dave?

08:14.460 --> 08:16.394
I thought you said
you weren't listening.

08:16.395 --> 08:19.197
No, no, no, no,
just a few juicy tidbits

08:19.198 --> 08:21.932
Did waft over the fence.

08:21.933 --> 08:24.034
He's put me
in a real awkward position.

08:24.035 --> 08:26.537
Well, are you referring
to the ham and cheese,

08:26.538 --> 08:29.474
The opera
or the tall blonde?

08:29.475 --> 08:31.476
"a few juicy tidbits," wilson?

08:31.477 --> 08:33.711
Sounds like you ended up
with the whole tid.

08:33.712 --> 08:35.712
Well, you heard
the whole situation.

08:35.714 --> 08:37.381
What do you do...

08:37.381 --> 08:40.818
Uh, defend your buddy
or hurt karen with the truth?

08:40.818 --> 08:42.720
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm-mm.

08:42.721 --> 08:47.325
Well, tim, I'm reminded
of what aristotle said
about plato.

08:47.326 --> 08:50.361
Keep the lid on tight,
otherwise it'll all dry out.

08:50.362 --> 08:52.296
That's what I tell mark.

08:55.334 --> 08:59.970
No, no, no, no, tim,
not play-doh.

08:59.971 --> 09:02.406
Plato, the philosopher.

09:02.407 --> 09:04.775
Oh, yeah,
very introspective guy.
Wore the tunics.

09:04.776 --> 09:06.777
He was a very nice guy.
Very nice guy.

09:06.778 --> 09:08.279
Aristotle said,

09:08.280 --> 09:12.450
"plato is dear to me,
but dearer still is truth.

09:12.451 --> 09:15.319
"piety requires us
to honor truth

09:15.320 --> 09:17.155
Above our friends."

09:17.156 --> 09:19.524
Yeah, so if it comes up,
I should tell the truth.

09:19.525 --> 09:22.260
Well, tim,
there's no easy answer.
It's the age-old dilemma.

09:22.261 --> 09:24.262
The high road or the low road,

09:24.263 --> 09:26.264
The lady or the tiger,

09:26.265 --> 09:28.266
Door number one,
door number two.

09:28.267 --> 09:29.600
<i>(grunts)</i> yeah.

09:29.601 --> 09:33.037
Firing squad, electric chair.
It's all the same to me.

09:33.038 --> 09:35.773
Tim, you should
say goodbye.
They're going.

09:35.774 --> 09:38.276
Bye, you guys.
Yeah, we have to pick up
dave's suit.

09:38.277 --> 09:40.278
He didn't get a chance
to get it yesterday

09:40.279 --> 09:42.380
'cause you two guys
got together for lunch.

09:42.381 --> 09:43.847
Yeah, right, lunch.

09:43.848 --> 09:45.349
Let's go, honey.

09:45.350 --> 09:48.018
So, tim, did you like
the boxing cat grill?

09:48.019 --> 09:50.054
It's one of our
favorite places.

09:50.055 --> 09:51.055
Yeah.

09:51.056 --> 09:52.590
Did you try
the pea soup?

09:52.591 --> 09:55.893
No, ham and cheese on rye.

09:55.894 --> 09:59.263
Yeah. Well, it was fun.
Thanks again for lunch, tim.

09:59.264 --> 10:00.931
Hey, dave...
<i>(dave)</i> hmm?

10:00.932 --> 10:03.701
...Come to think of it,
remember who paid the bill?

10:03.702 --> 10:06.204
I think you owe me
20 bucks, don't you?

10:11.643 --> 10:13.511
<i>(grunts)</i> oh-ho.

10:16.181 --> 10:17.448
There you go.

10:17.449 --> 10:19.517
Thanks.
See ya.

10:19.518 --> 10:20.518
Bye.

10:20.519 --> 10:22.019
Thanks a lot,
you guys.

10:22.020 --> 10:23.854
See you later.
You're welcome. Bye.

10:23.855 --> 10:24.855
Bye-bye.

10:24.856 --> 10:26.524
Have fun
at the opera.

10:26.525 --> 10:28.192
Like that's
humanly possible.

10:28.193 --> 10:30.695
I'm gonna go change
out of these pants,
honey.

10:30.696 --> 10:32.697
Wait a minute.
Not so fast.

10:32.698 --> 10:34.699
You didn't have lunch
with dave yesterday.

10:34.700 --> 10:37.034
Yeah, I did.
He just covered his check.

10:37.035 --> 10:39.770
You told me that you were
at the project house

10:39.771 --> 10:41.272
All day long.

10:41.273 --> 10:44.675
Yeah, except for the part
where I had lunch with dave.

10:44.676 --> 10:46.410
But dave works downtown.
That's like 20 miles away.

10:46.411 --> 10:51.115
That's why we met halfway
at the boxing cat grill.

10:51.116 --> 10:54.418
What happened to the lunch
that I packed for you?

10:54.419 --> 10:57.288
I took that with me.

10:57.289 --> 10:59.223
To the restaurant?

10:59.224 --> 11:03.894
We couldn't get in,
so we had to eat in the car.

11:03.895 --> 11:07.598
Then why did he
give you the 20?

11:07.599 --> 11:10.968
I sold him my sandwich.

11:13.972 --> 11:16.206
There is something fishy
going on here.

11:16.207 --> 11:18.542
Either you did something wrong
or dave did.

11:18.543 --> 11:21.078
Those are my only options?

11:21.079 --> 11:23.981
Is he seeing somebody else?
Don't lie to me.

11:23.982 --> 11:25.516
Don't lie to you.

11:25.517 --> 11:27.151
Look at me.

11:27.152 --> 11:31.455
Look me in the eye
and tell me that he isn't
seeing someone else.

11:33.892 --> 11:35.359
Define "seeing."

11:35.360 --> 11:38.228
Ohh, no! Oh, my...

11:38.229 --> 11:40.230
I gotta call her now.
Don't call her.

11:40.231 --> 11:42.733
This is none of your business.
Jill, hang the phone up.

11:42.734 --> 11:45.403
Karen is my best friend.
I set the two of them up.
I'm responsible.

11:45.404 --> 11:47.905
I gotta tell her that jerk
is fooling around on her.

11:47.906 --> 11:50.541
We don't know
if that's true.
Is it?

11:50.542 --> 11:52.610
No.

11:52.611 --> 11:54.612
I know you.
You're covering for dave.

11:54.613 --> 11:56.681
When you say "no," you really
mean "yes," don't you?

11:56.682 --> 11:59.750
No.
See?

11:59.751 --> 12:01.752
So two noes make a yes?

12:01.753 --> 12:02.753
Yeah.

12:02.754 --> 12:04.355
Does that yes mean no?
<i>No.</i>

12:04.356 --> 12:05.589
What?

12:05.590 --> 12:07.591
I gotta leave a message
on her machine.

12:07.592 --> 12:09.593
Stay out of this, please.
Stay out of this.

12:09.594 --> 12:11.595
Ok, look,
I will stay out of this

12:11.596 --> 12:14.565
If you call dave and tell him
that he's gotta come clean
with karen.

12:14.566 --> 12:18.936
I got a better idea.
Let's split the 20.

12:18.937 --> 12:20.571
Tim...

12:20.572 --> 12:22.973
All right, all right.
Take the whole thing.

12:22.974 --> 12:24.975
You gotta call him.

12:24.976 --> 12:27.911
Jill, you don't understand.
I can't call him
and talk about this.

12:27.912 --> 12:30.414
Men do not call each other
and talk about relationships.

12:30.415 --> 12:31.649
Well, they talk about sex.

12:31.650 --> 12:34.652
So? That has nothing
to do with relationships.

12:37.155 --> 12:40.491
Except in ours.

12:40.492 --> 12:43.694
Until now.

12:50.902 --> 12:53.237
Youch. What do I
owe you for this?

12:53.238 --> 12:55.773
Hey, after the way
you covered for me
with karen yesterday,

12:55.774 --> 12:57.641
That's on me.

12:59.110 --> 13:02.145
Dave, let's talk
about yesterday
for a minute.

13:02.146 --> 13:04.081
Hey, keep the 20.
It was a good touch.

13:04.082 --> 13:06.817
You really put me
on the spot, dave.

13:06.818 --> 13:08.519
I know. I'm sorry, man.

13:08.520 --> 13:10.354
Hey, but you
handled it great.

13:10.355 --> 13:12.189
Karen did not
suspect a thing.

13:12.190 --> 13:15.493
Let me tell you something
about karen and I.
Hi, honey.

13:15.494 --> 13:16.994
Hi.
Look who's here.

13:16.995 --> 13:19.830
Hi, jill.
How you doin'?
Fine. Thanks.

13:19.831 --> 13:21.832
Dave brought
the right distributor,

13:21.833 --> 13:23.834
So now maybe we can
time this thing correctly.

13:23.835 --> 13:28.338
Well, timing's everything,
isn't it, dave?

13:28.339 --> 13:33.043
You guys want me
to make you some sandwiches?
Ham and cheese, perhaps?

13:33.044 --> 13:36.046
That'd be great.
And get some coffee
for us, too.

13:41.420 --> 13:44.354
I'll make the coffee, though.
I'll do it.

13:47.626 --> 13:48.826
She knows?

13:48.827 --> 13:51.194
No.

13:51.195 --> 13:52.362
You told her.

13:52.363 --> 13:54.298
No, I didn't.

13:54.299 --> 13:57.568
And she's told karen
already, hasn't she?
I told her not to tell karen.

13:57.569 --> 13:59.537
Great.

13:59.538 --> 14:02.540
Now, is jill gonna act weird
every time I see her?

14:02.541 --> 14:05.543
I don't think you'll be
seeing her that much.

14:05.544 --> 14:07.177
That's a joke, dave.

14:07.178 --> 14:08.913
Why did you tell her, tim?

14:08.914 --> 14:10.915
She's my wife. I have
a hard time lying to her.

14:10.916 --> 14:13.517
She made me
look her in the eye.

14:15.420 --> 14:18.322
Now I have to tell karen,
because if I don't,
jill will.

14:18.323 --> 14:20.825
Probably.
You have sunk me
with karen.

14:20.826 --> 14:22.827
No, dave, you sunk yourself
with karen.

14:22.828 --> 14:25.663
You torpedoed this whole thing
and tried to drag me into it.

14:25.664 --> 14:28.165
Don't get all mad...
Thanks for
the lecture, tim.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.167
Oh, come on, dave.
Wait, one more question.

14:30.168 --> 14:33.737
Is this the high-pull model
with the dual points on there?

14:33.738 --> 14:36.907
Come on, dave.
Dave, lighten up.

14:38.709 --> 14:41.479
All right, thanks.

14:41.480 --> 14:42.580
No luck?

14:42.581 --> 14:44.582
I cannot find
a distributor anywhere.

14:44.583 --> 14:46.584
Of course, dave's got
the one I want,

14:46.585 --> 14:49.453
But he hates me now,
so I won't be getting
that one.

14:49.454 --> 14:51.455
That's what I get
for being honest.

14:51.456 --> 14:54.091
You did the right thing, honey.

14:54.092 --> 14:56.927
Try to remember that
when you're pushing
my hot rod up I-75.

14:56.928 --> 14:58.762
"honey, we gotta pass
this truck."

14:58.763 --> 15:00.698
"I'm pushing
as hard as I can."

15:00.699 --> 15:03.433
<i>(rings)</i>

15:03.434 --> 15:05.202
Hello.

15:05.203 --> 15:07.237
Hi, dave.

15:07.238 --> 15:08.706
Uh-huh.

15:11.576 --> 15:13.210
Yeah.

15:13.211 --> 15:15.579
She did, yeah.

15:15.580 --> 15:18.081
What? That's amazing.

15:18.082 --> 15:19.449
Well, not amazing.

15:19.450 --> 15:22.820
I'm not happy about it,
but no hard feelings, no.

15:22.821 --> 15:25.222
Oh, dave, dave, dave,
dave, before you go,

15:25.223 --> 15:27.290
Could I have
that distributor back?

15:27.291 --> 15:28.826
'cause I re...

15:28.827 --> 15:30.027
Dave?

15:31.596 --> 15:33.463
Well? What happened?

15:33.464 --> 15:34.965
Karen dumped dave.

15:34.966 --> 15:37.367
Tsk. Well, sure,
after the blonde.
No, no, no, no.

15:37.368 --> 15:39.703
He didn't even tell her
about the blonde.

15:39.704 --> 15:42.205
She just said she didn't want
to see him anymore.

15:42.206 --> 15:44.074
Really? Good for her.

15:44.075 --> 15:46.076
Well, I guess
her instincts
were right.

15:46.077 --> 15:47.477
Instincts?

15:47.478 --> 15:49.713
Yeah, well, she mentioned
that there were some problems.

15:49.714 --> 15:51.715
You know, dave wasn't
really there for her.

15:51.716 --> 15:54.718
Wasn't there for her?
He went to the opera with her.

15:54.719 --> 15:56.720
How much more "there"
can a guy be?

15:56.721 --> 15:59.990
Not that kind of there.
Emotionally present.

15:59.991 --> 16:01.625
They weren't connecting.

16:01.626 --> 16:03.827
She was thinking about
breaking up with him
last week.

16:03.828 --> 16:06.163
Wait a minute.

16:06.164 --> 16:08.165
You knew she was gonna
break up with him?

16:08.166 --> 16:11.869
No, I knew that
she was thinking about it.
Why didn't you tell me that?

16:11.870 --> 16:14.672
I didn't know she was
gonna do it for sure.

16:14.673 --> 16:16.674
Besides, I promised her
I wouldn't.

16:16.675 --> 16:19.176
Well, I promised dave
I wouldn't tell you
about the blonde.

16:19.177 --> 16:22.245
It's not my fault
that you can't keep a secret.

16:22.246 --> 16:24.281
I can keep a secret.

16:24.282 --> 16:28.018
This wasn't the kind of secret
that you're supposed to keep.

16:28.019 --> 16:31.188
Hold it a minute.
Back the truck up.

16:31.189 --> 16:33.457
There's some secrets
that you're supposed to keep

16:33.458 --> 16:35.459
And other secrets you're
not supposed to keep?

16:35.460 --> 16:36.594
Yeah.

16:36.595 --> 16:39.697
Is there a book on this
somewhere?

16:39.698 --> 16:41.699
Tell you what. If somebody
tells you a secret

16:41.700 --> 16:44.001
And you're not sure
what kind it is,
tell it to me,

16:44.002 --> 16:46.336
And then I'll tell you
whether you should
keep it or not.

16:46.337 --> 16:48.371
Arr!

16:49.574 --> 16:51.575
If you remember
the last show,

16:51.576 --> 16:53.711
We promised
a wood-sniffing demonstration

16:53.712 --> 16:58.315
By our own
al "dare to be dull" borland.

16:59.918 --> 17:01.986
Blindfold in place, al?
Yes, it is, tim.

17:01.987 --> 17:04.054
Ok, step in position
there.

17:04.055 --> 17:05.888
Ready?
Yes.

17:05.890 --> 17:07.190
Aim, fire!

17:07.191 --> 17:08.892
Ahh!
Ha-ha-ha.

17:08.893 --> 17:11.729
Just checking
if you're breathing, al.

17:11.730 --> 17:13.864
That's all I'm doing.

17:13.865 --> 17:15.298
As you can see,

17:15.299 --> 17:17.300
I've got our
three samples of wood

17:17.300 --> 17:19.301
Laid out on the workbench.

17:19.303 --> 17:21.304
I will hand them to al
one at a time,

17:21.305 --> 17:24.307
And he claims he can tell us
what type of wood it is
just by smelling it.

17:24.308 --> 17:25.876
We shall see.

17:25.877 --> 17:29.146
Al borland,
name that wood.

17:30.915 --> 17:32.215
<i>(sniffs)</i>

17:32.216 --> 17:35.686
Tim, that's hickory.

17:41.626 --> 17:44.695
Can you believe it, ladies?
This man's single.

17:46.397 --> 17:47.931
Second sample.

17:47.932 --> 17:51.368
Al borland,
name that wood.

17:53.237 --> 17:54.672
<i>(sniffs)</i>

17:54.673 --> 17:55.673
Cedar.
Ha!

17:55.674 --> 17:56.774
Wait.

17:58.176 --> 18:00.577
<i>(sniffs)</i>

18:00.578 --> 18:02.780
Western red cedar.

18:10.354 --> 18:12.622
You almost
messed that one up, al.

18:12.623 --> 18:15.292
Well, I'm fighting off
a cold, tim.

18:16.594 --> 18:18.896
Well, this next sample...

18:18.897 --> 18:21.331
<i>(audience laughs)</i>

18:21.332 --> 18:24.068
...Should be a little bit
more difficult to discern, al.

18:24.069 --> 18:26.770
Might have to take
a big ol' whiff
of this thing

18:26.771 --> 18:28.772
To figure out what it is.

18:28.773 --> 18:31.709
Well, I'm up to
the challenge, tim.

18:31.710 --> 18:34.511
I certainly hope so, al.

18:36.647 --> 18:40.350
Al borland,
name that wood.

18:40.351 --> 18:41.785
<i>(chuckles)</i>

18:41.786 --> 18:43.486
<i>(sniffs)</i>

18:43.487 --> 18:45.555
Ohh!

18:45.556 --> 18:47.191
<i>(coughs)</i>

18:47.192 --> 18:52.096
Well, it's a hardwood
from the pacific northwest,

18:52.097 --> 18:54.497
And... Ugh.

18:55.967 --> 18:58.435
Uh... Well, it's, uh...

18:58.436 --> 19:01.304
Uh, this particular piece
seems to have some...

19:01.305 --> 19:03.240
Some type of a fungus.

19:07.145 --> 19:09.913
Uh... Well, uh, uh...

19:09.914 --> 19:14.084
Ugh. Let me try this again.

19:14.085 --> 19:16.887
<i>(hyperventilates)</i>

19:16.888 --> 19:17.988
<i>(sniffs)</i>

19:17.989 --> 19:19.522
Paagh!
Ohh!

19:26.664 --> 19:27.965
Here comes mom.

19:27.966 --> 19:30.167
<i>(randy)</i> come on,
cover up the catapult.

19:35.774 --> 19:38.842
What's all this noise
out here?

19:38.843 --> 19:41.378
Uh, we were just trying
to build a fort.

19:41.379 --> 19:45.215
Did your dad tell you
you could do this?

19:45.216 --> 19:47.151
Yeah, it was his idea.

19:56.327 --> 19:58.728
Clean it up
before you come in.

19:58.729 --> 20:00.030
No problem.
<i>(brad)</i> ok.

20:02.167 --> 20:03.466
Come on.

20:07.906 --> 20:09.206
Hi.

20:09.207 --> 20:10.540
Hi.

20:12.310 --> 20:14.144
I was thinking about
karen and dave.

20:14.145 --> 20:16.680
Uhh. Not that again.

20:16.681 --> 20:19.482
Yeah. On the way home tonight,
driving the car,

20:19.483 --> 20:21.551
I started to thinking...

20:23.087 --> 20:25.722
...You owe me an apology.

20:25.723 --> 20:27.457
Get out of here.

20:27.458 --> 20:29.559
No. I was more honest
about dave

20:29.560 --> 20:31.561
Than you were about karen,

20:31.562 --> 20:33.063
So you apologize.

20:33.064 --> 20:34.664
Apologize? Forget it.

20:34.665 --> 20:36.499
We're always
supposed to apologize

20:36.500 --> 20:38.668
When we do something wrong,
so say you're sorry.

20:38.669 --> 20:40.938
<i>(sighs)</i> will that make you
feel better?

20:40.939 --> 20:43.240
Yes.

20:43.241 --> 20:45.642
Ok, I'm sorry.

20:45.643 --> 20:47.510
Oh, is that it?

20:47.511 --> 20:49.512
<i>(imitates her)</i>
"ok, I'm sorry."

20:49.513 --> 20:53.383
I'm very, very sorry.

20:53.384 --> 20:55.185
That's pathetic.

20:55.186 --> 20:57.855
You'd never let me get away
with an apology like that.

20:59.523 --> 21:01.325
Ok.

21:01.326 --> 21:02.492
Now what?

21:10.034 --> 21:11.301
<i>(southern accent)</i> tim...

21:11.302 --> 21:13.036
Oh, jeez.

21:13.037 --> 21:17.007
...I wronged you terribly.

21:17.008 --> 21:20.377
I'm not fit
to carry the name "taylor."

21:20.378 --> 21:21.979
From hence forward on,

21:21.980 --> 21:25.883
I shall be known
only as jill, the wrong one.

21:25.884 --> 21:28.352
Please, please, please,
please forgive me.

21:28.353 --> 21:29.686
<i>(makes kissing noises)</i>

21:29.687 --> 21:31.688
<i>(normal voice)</i>
hey, what are you doing?

21:31.689 --> 21:33.690
<i>(southern accent)</i>
say it like you mean it.

21:33.691 --> 21:37.560
<i>(laughs)</i> no, because
I was not wrong.

21:37.561 --> 21:39.729
At least 'pologize
for your lousy accent.

21:39.730 --> 21:43.133
<i>(laughs)</i> yours was worse.
<i>(normal voice)</i> was not.

21:43.134 --> 21:44.134
Was too.
Was not.

21:44.135 --> 21:46.069
Was too.
All right.

21:46.070 --> 21:47.137
<i>(laughs)</i>

21:47.138 --> 21:49.139
Now I must spray you
into submission.

21:49.140 --> 21:52.109
Don't even think
about it.
It's diet, honey.

21:55.813 --> 21:58.282
The mcgurn boys
are in their backyard.

21:58.283 --> 21:59.816
Ok, brad, hurry up.

21:59.817 --> 22:01.484
All ready.

22:01.485 --> 22:04.254
Ok, everybody
just stand clear.

22:07.458 --> 22:09.326
Hey, mcgurns.

22:09.327 --> 22:11.395
<i>(boy)</i> yeah?
<i>(boy #2)</i> what?

22:11.396 --> 22:12.862
Eat garbage.

22:14.765 --> 22:18.535
<i>(boy)</i> ohh! That's garbage!
You're in big trouble.

22:20.939 --> 22:22.039
<i>(jill laughs)</i>

22:22.040 --> 22:23.540
Just say you're sorry.
No!

22:23.541 --> 22:25.742
Just say you're sorry
one time.
No.

22:25.743 --> 22:27.277
Hey, what's this?

22:27.278 --> 22:30.814
I don't know.
They said you knew about it.
Oh-ho.

22:32.850 --> 22:36.253
It's so medieval looking.
Ar-ar-ar.

22:36.254 --> 22:38.422
<i>(southern accent)</i> you can run,
but you can't hide.

22:38.423 --> 22:40.090
I know where you live.

22:40.091 --> 22:41.591
<i>(boy)</i> hey, taylors.
<i>(boy #2)</i> hey, tim.

22:41.592 --> 22:43.126
<i>(normal voice)</i>
what do you want?

22:43.127 --> 22:44.627
<i>(boys)</i> eat this!

22:50.268 --> 22:51.969
Does that yes mean no?
<i>No.</i>

22:51.970 --> 22:54.637
What?
I gotta call her.
I'll just leave a message...

22:54.638 --> 22:56.906
Jill, come on,
stay out of this.

22:56.907 --> 22:59.009
Ok, look.
<i>(drops phone)</i>

23:07.018 --> 23:08.352
<i>(no audio)</i>

23:08.353 --> 23:11.088
Don't lie to me.
Don't lie to you.

23:11.089 --> 23:12.990
Look me in the eye...
