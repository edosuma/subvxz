ONE DAY, WHEN I WAS SIX,

29:41.127 --> 29:43.390

WERE WALKING ON THE BEACH,

29:43.520 --> 29:44.826
COLLECTING DRIFTWOOD.

29:45.435 --> 29:47.698
WE SAW PELICANS
FOR THE FIRST TIME.

29:49.048 --> 29:51.267
AND THIS IS THE WOOD
WE GOT THAT DAY.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.706
MY FATHER HAD BEEN SICK.

29:55.837 --> 29:58.100
HE DIED A WEEK LATER.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.537
MY MOTHER TOLD ME
HE WENT TO HEAVEN,

30:02.757 --> 30:04.977

TOOK HIM THERE.

THE BATTERY OF TESTS YOU TOOK
CONFIRMED ONE THING,

31:11.957 --> 31:13.349
AND THAT IS
YOU HAVE AN EYE DISEASE

31:13.480 --> 31:14.916
CALLED RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA.

31:15.569 --> 31:17.092

31:19.181 --> 31:20.617
YES IT IS,
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU,

31:20.748 --> 31:22.663
BUT ONE OF THE PROBLEMS WITH RP

31:22.793 --> 31:24.012
IS THAT IT CAUSES TUNNEL VISION.

31:24.534 --> 31:27.886
THE NORMAL FIELD OF VISION
IS 180 DEGREES,

31:28.016 --> 31:30.845
BUT YOURS IS DOWN
TO JUST TEN DEGREES,

31:30.976 --> 31:32.629
TOP AND BOTTOM,

31:32.760 --> 31:33.935
AND THAT'S WHY YOU MISS

31:34.066 --> 31:34.980

31:35.850 --> 31:38.026

WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO FIX IT?

31:38.679 --> 31:40.333

YOU HAVE TO DO IS

31:40.463 --> 31:42.988

PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO THE SUN.

A LIFEGUARD AT ALL.

32:14.280 --> 32:15.759

SOME KIND OF CURE

32:15.890 --> 32:16.760
