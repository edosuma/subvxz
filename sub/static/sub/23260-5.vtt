00:28.985 --> 00:30.073
- Lainie Whicker.

00:30.117 --> 00:31.553
- She just disappeared.

00:31.596 --> 00:32.554
- Maybe there's a way
we can find her

00:32.597 --> 00:33.555

It's political--

00:46.307 --> 00:47.612
straight up your alley.

00:47.656 --> 00:49.223

00:49.266 --> 00:50.920

offer you my support.

00:52.139 --> 00:54.010

- Are you gonna tell dad it's

00:56.839 --> 00:58.319
another surprise pregnancy?

00:58.362 --> 00:59.668

Harding's campaign

01:01.278 --> 01:02.845

01:06.066 --> 01:07.763

- No, no, no!

01:09.199 --> 01:10.157

The guy in the blue cap

- Okay, Tess,
the end of Lainie's dream--

04:16.647 --> 04:18.475
it gave us three distinct
images to work with:

04:18.519 --> 04:21.522
A red barn, a wind turbine,
and a road sign that said--

04:21.565 --> 04:22.740
- Amsterdam.
- That's right.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.264
- How do we know
that those images

04:24.307 --> 04:26.309
weren't just part
of Lainie's dreamscape?

04:26.353 --> 04:28.050
- That's all we have
to work with.

04:28.093 --> 04:30.574
- And is it Amsterdam in the
Netherlands, in New York?

04:30.618 --> 04:32.228
- As it turns out,

04:32.272 --> 04:35.100
there are 16 cities
named Amsterdam

04:35.144 --> 04:36.319
in North America alone.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.668
And the one in New York

04:37.712 --> 04:39.627
is less than 200 miles away.

04:39.670 --> 04:42.325
Still, it's a bit of a reach
to assume that

04:42.369 --> 04:43.935

04:46.460 --> 04:47.809

04:47.852 --> 04:49.463
How many red barns
can there be

04:49.506 --> 04:51.639
with a wind turbine
next to it near a roadside?

04:51.682 --> 04:55.207
- I'll go with you.

04:55.251 --> 04:56.470
- It's fine,

04:56.513 --> 04:58.254
as long as we're
not back too late.

04:59.516 --> 05:01.039
I wanna be there
if we find her.

05:01.083 --> 05:02.693
- Okay.

05:02.737 --> 05:03.781
- I should go too.

05:03.825 --> 05:05.217
- Not necessary.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.176
- If this Shadowman
is responsible

05:07.219 --> 05:08.525
for Lainie's abduction,

05:08.569 --> 05:10.222
if he's as dangerous
as he sounds,

05:10.266 --> 05:12.486
then I think the more
hands on deck, the better.

05:14.836 --> 05:16.185
- Yeah.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.230
- Uh, I don't know.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.494
Maybe because
I like Lainie quite a bit

05:20.537 --> 05:21.930
and I'm concerned about her.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.628
Maybe because
she went missing on my watch,

05:24.672 --> 05:27.327
and I'm just pissed off
that somebody abducted her.

05:27.370 --> 05:28.893
Because I have
a thing about that--

05:28.937 --> 05:30.242
people being abducted.

05:30.286 --> 05:31.461
- Says the man
who placed a bid

05:31.505 --> 05:32.462
on my abducted son.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.421
- Oh, for God's sake, Tess,

05:34.464 --> 05:36.379
I was trying to protect James.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.773
When are you going
to start believing me?

05:38.816 --> 05:40.340
- You really want
an answer to that?

05:40.383 --> 05:42.864
- Do you have any damn idea

05:42.907 --> 05:47.172
what those crazy people
had in mind for him?

05:47.216 --> 05:50.393
Do you?

05:50.437 --> 05:53.570
They were gonna lock him up
and throw away the key

05:53.614 --> 05:56.094
and you were never
going to see him again,

05:56.138 --> 05:58.183
ever.

05:58.227 --> 06:01.273
All I ever tried to do

06:01.317 --> 06:03.841
was bring him to you.

06:05.539 --> 06:08.280
Why would you do that?

06:08.324 --> 06:14.199
- Because the exact same thing
happened to my sister.

06:14.243 --> 06:16.854
I swore never
to let it happen again,

06:16.898 --> 06:19.074
although now it has,

06:19.117 --> 06:21.076
which is why
I'm going with you.

06:26.821 --> 06:29.432
- So, basically,
we're looking for a hat.

06:29.476 --> 06:31.478
- A start.

06:31.521 --> 06:33.175
- Thank you.

06:36.221 --> 06:38.267
I thought you saw him
in the dream world--

06:38.310 --> 06:40.530
whatever you call it--
a man with the face

06:40.574 --> 06:41.792
like a rotting hamburger?

06:41.836 --> 06:43.315
- He doesn't look that...
hideous

06:43.359 --> 06:45.753
in the real world.
No one does.

06:46.884 --> 06:49.713
If you had seen the shape
he takes in dreams, Alex--

06:49.757 --> 06:51.106
- Tell me.

06:51.149 --> 06:52.586
Maybe there's
a clue in all of it,

06:52.629 --> 06:54.675
something we can track
in the real world.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.852
- It's more like a feeling
than anything else,

06:57.895 --> 07:00.985
like everything horrible
you've ever had happen to you

07:01.029 --> 07:04.598
in your life is right there,
weighing on your heart--

07:04.641 --> 07:06.991
anger and hate so palpable,

07:07.035 --> 07:08.776
you can taste it in your mouth.

07:08.819 --> 07:11.039
- Awesome.

07:13.128 --> 07:15.565
- This may be enough
to let our perp know

07:15.609 --> 07:17.132
we're looking for him.

07:17.175 --> 07:19.526
Maybe it'll slow him down.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.441
- Maybe.

07:21.484 --> 07:23.791
I just wish there was,
you know,

07:23.834 --> 07:25.967
some kind of pattern
to this stuff.

07:26.010 --> 07:27.925
