00:02.492 --> 00:05.460
<i>Synchronized swimming...
dumbest sport ever.</i>

00:05.495 --> 00:07.729
<i>I'm 6:00 a.m., and
I'm sitting on a cold bleacher,</i>

00:07.797 --> 00:10.264
<i>watching Taylor's feet flail
two inches above the water.</i>

00:10.350 --> 00:12.100
<i>My back is sweating,</i>

00:12.152 --> 00:14.585
<i>and the humidity in here
just Def Leppard'd my hair.</i>

00:14.671 --> 00:17.338
Go, April! Excellent crane position!

00:18.842 --> 00:20.174
Go, Taylor!

00:20.226 --> 00:22.226
Way to hold your breath underwater!

00:22.312 --> 00:23.444
Who are you yelling at?

00:23.496 --> 00:26.414
Uh... I thought you.

00:26.466 --> 00:28.333
Well, my team just finished
at the other end of the pool.

00:28.418 --> 00:29.584
Well, then whose feet

00:29.636 --> 00:31.903
have I been watching
for the last half-hour?

00:31.988 --> 00:33.021
Could be anyone.

00:33.106 --> 00:34.022
Oh.

00:34.107 --> 00:35.189
I was thinking,

00:35.241 --> 00:36.658
synchronized swimming is not my...

00:36.743 --> 00:38.126
You're quitting?

00:38.211 --> 00:40.261
Well... I know
you bought me this one-piece,

00:40.296 --> 00:42.647
and we can't return it because
we ripped out the sani-strip...

00:42.732 --> 00:44.232
I'm so happy you're quitting!

00:44.267 --> 00:46.117
You keep this up, you'll be my favorite.

00:46.202 --> 00:48.786
So long, suckers.

00:56.796 --> 00:57.662
Oh, hi, honey. Hi, Ayo.

00:57.747 --> 00:59.247
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Otto.

00:59.332 --> 01:00.214
How was your day?

01:00.250 --> 01:01.215
I'm quitting drama club.

01:01.251 --> 01:02.583
Taylor, you're not quitting.

01:02.635 --> 01:04.251
You just quit synchronized
swimming two weeks ago.

01:04.304 --> 01:05.503
Why are you fighting this?

01:05.588 --> 01:07.088
This is one less production
of "Our Town"

01:07.173 --> 01:09.724
- we have to sit through.
- You said I had to take another activity,

01:09.759 --> 01:12.810
but it turns out, drama combines
my two biggest fears...

01:12.896 --> 01:14.595
speaking in public and reading.

01:14.647 --> 01:16.731
Yeah, that's acting. What did
you think it would be like?

01:16.766 --> 01:18.266
I don't know... Instagram?

01:18.318 --> 01:20.435
Taylor, I don't want quitting
to become a pattern.

01:20.487 --> 01:22.186
Dad, you can't make me take drama.

01:22.272 --> 01:23.271
Ayo, tell him.

01:24.607 --> 01:26.491
Um... I'm your boyfriend.

01:26.576 --> 01:28.409
My goal is to have your parents like me,

01:28.445 --> 01:31.446
so I'm just gonna sit quietly over here.

01:31.531 --> 01:33.998
Taylor, you have to learn
to stick with things.

01:34.084 --> 01:35.666
I let synchronized swimming slide,

01:35.752 --> 01:37.835
but you're going from quitting
to being a quitter.

01:37.921 --> 01:41.039
- Remember, the Otto motto is...
- "Ottos never quit."

01:41.124 --> 01:43.458
- Exactly.
- That motto is so stupid.

01:43.543 --> 01:45.176
Taylor, don't say stupid.

01:46.212 --> 01:47.462
Kind of the best word for it, though.

01:47.514 --> 01:50.381
Hey, not quitting builds character.
Take me for example.

01:50.467 --> 01:51.632
I'm about to start teaching that class

01:51.684 --> 01:52.934
at the Education Institute.

01:52.969 --> 01:54.635
Attendance has dropped,
but I'm not quitting.

01:54.687 --> 01:56.888
- Sounds like you should.
- Quit! Quit! Quit!

01:56.973 --> 01:58.556
Come on, Ayo. Join in!

01:58.641 --> 01:59.807
Quit! Quit! Quit!

01:59.859 --> 02:03.111
Again, I'm just gonna smile
and hold still.

02:03.146 --> 02:04.862
Oliver, back me up.

02:04.948 --> 02:06.647
Tell Dad that the drama club
at school is lame.

02:06.699 --> 02:08.316
- It's lame.
- See?

02:08.401 --> 02:10.818
But with Taylor's help,
it could become awesome.

02:10.904 --> 02:11.903
Jerk.

02:11.988 --> 02:14.455
Present.

02:14.491 --> 02:15.540
Where are you going?

02:15.625 --> 02:17.792
New GQ... got to stay current.

02:17.827 --> 02:20.294
I fear that I may have
a genetic predisposition

02:20.330 --> 02:21.662
to ugly shawl-collared sweaters,

02:21.714 --> 02:24.882
so I'm doing everything
in my power to fight it.

02:24.968 --> 02:27.251
Don't you wish that he would quit

02:27.337 --> 02:28.886
acting like such a turd?

02:28.972 --> 02:30.505
Yeah, but the Otto motto is
named after me,

02:30.557 --> 02:31.806
so it puts me in a tough position.

02:31.841 --> 02:33.808
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

02:33.893 --> 02:37.111
Hey! Did you take my glue stick?

02:37.197 --> 02:38.362
Yeah, one sec.

02:38.448 --> 02:39.747
I'm just finishing up my vision board.

02:39.799 --> 02:41.182
What's a vision board?

02:42.635 --> 02:45.269
It's a collage of the way
you want your life to be.

02:45.355 --> 02:47.855
- Let me see.
- No! It's none of your business.

02:47.907 --> 02:50.741
When you took my glue stick,
you made it my business.

02:52.412 --> 02:53.995
Hey! Give that back!

02:54.881 --> 02:57.849
Oliver, slow down. Anna-Kat, speed up!

02:57.934 --> 02:59.851
Run, my favorite child! Run!

03:03.957 --> 03:06.090
Whoa.

03:06.176 --> 03:07.542
<i>What is going on here?</i>

03:07.594 --> 03:09.377
<i>Hot guys in suits.</i>

03:09.462 --> 03:10.678
<i>Ashton Kutcher?</i>

03:10.730 --> 03:12.513
<i>Abs, abs, abs.</i>

03:12.565 --> 03:15.199
<i>And hold on...
arm around Cooper Bradford?</i>

03:15.285 --> 03:16.701
<i>Could Oliver be...</i>

03:16.786 --> 03:18.536
<i>No. Could he?</i>

03:18.621 --> 03:19.670
<i>Maybe.</i>

03:19.756 --> 03:21.088
<i>No.</i>

03:21.124 --> 03:22.423
<i>Maybe?</i>

03:25.678 --> 03:27.945
- Gay!
- Mm, I don't know.

03:28.031 --> 03:29.864
Come on! There's not a boob in sight.

03:29.899 --> 03:32.083
If Oliver's straight,
where are all the boobs, Katie?

03:32.168 --> 03:34.836
- Where are all the boobs?
- Valid question.

03:34.871 --> 03:37.305
Not to mention, who's this pretty boy,
and when's the honeymoon?

03:37.390 --> 03:39.006
That's Cooper, his best friend.

03:39.058 --> 03:41.559
And, remember,
Oliver dated that girl Alice.

03:41.644 --> 03:44.362
Hmm. He could be bi. Or pan.

03:44.447 --> 03:46.998
Or polyamorous. Or polysexual.

03:47.083 --> 03:49.450
Or he could be
a run-of-the-mill cisgender male

03:49.502 --> 03:50.835
who happened to create a vision board

03:50.904 --> 03:52.720
with a lot of hot hunks on it.

03:52.772 --> 03:54.772
It's hard for me to follow
all these new gender terms,

03:54.858 --> 03:56.057
but it doesn't affect me,

03:56.142 --> 03:58.109
because I only go
to the bathroom in my own home.

03:58.194 --> 04:01.445
I don't think Oliver's gay.
A mother knows these things.

04:01.531 --> 04:02.713
I would've noticed something.

04:02.799 --> 04:04.382
Well, maybe he's old-school...

04:04.467 --> 04:05.833
gay but doesn't want to accept it,

04:05.885 --> 04:07.501
so he pushes his feelings
deep down inside

04:07.554 --> 04:09.103
and behaves like a complete d-bag.

04:11.691 --> 04:13.357
Oliver's definitely gay.

04:17.213 --> 04:20.130
And that explains
why he's such a complete d-bag.

04:20.216 --> 04:21.349
Plus, the board.

04:21.384 --> 04:24.435
I don't know.
I look at this, I see Armani.

04:24.520 --> 04:27.538
I see expensive watches, a Ferrari.

04:27.624 --> 04:29.540
No, this is just shallow,
materialistic Oliver.

04:29.626 --> 04:31.259
What about Ashton Kutcher?

04:31.294 --> 04:32.927
Well, he's a successful businessman.

04:32.962 --> 04:34.128
He invested in Skype and Uber.

04:34.180 --> 04:36.397
Oh. You're right.

04:36.432 --> 04:38.566
This could be just about business.

04:38.601 --> 04:41.736
Now who's gonna take me
on my mother-son gay cruise?

04:41.788 --> 04:43.788
Turns out everyone in the drama club

04:43.873 --> 04:45.373
has to audition for the school play.

04:45.425 --> 04:46.457
Great!

04:46.542 --> 04:47.792
What scene are you gonna audition with?

04:47.877 --> 04:49.710
I think I still have my
"Fiddler" beard here somewhere.

04:49.796 --> 04:51.062
No, I-I don't want to audition.

04:51.147 --> 04:54.065
I don't want to embarrass myself.
Why won't you let me drop out?

04:54.150 --> 04:55.449
Because Ottos never quit.

04:55.485 --> 04:57.285
You're ruining my life!

04:57.370 --> 04:59.287
Channel that. That was super dramatic.

05:01.174 --> 05:02.423
This is all your fault, you know?

05:02.508 --> 05:04.809
We have discussed this.
Nothing is ever my fault, Greg.

05:04.894 --> 05:06.811
She's a quitter,
'cause you're a quitter.

05:06.896 --> 05:08.095
That is not true.

05:08.147 --> 05:09.614
Name one thing that I've quit.

05:11.000 --> 05:17.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

05:18.758 --> 05:20.124
Taylor's baby blanket.

05:20.209 --> 05:21.542
She was a very small baby.

05:23.179 --> 05:25.880
Oliver's memory book...

05:25.932 --> 05:27.014
has three pages.

05:27.100 --> 05:29.016
Okay.

05:29.102 --> 05:32.353
And I think this is Anna-Kat's,
but I'm not really sure

05:32.405 --> 05:34.021
because you didn't finish
spelling her name.

05:34.073 --> 05:35.206
You interrupted me.

05:35.291 --> 05:36.490
You asked me to come downstairs

05:36.576 --> 05:38.159
and help you put together
the Exersaucer.

05:38.244 --> 05:41.128
That was for 15 minutes 7 years ago.

05:41.164 --> 05:43.965
You quit everything the second
it stops being easy and fun,

05:44.050 --> 05:47.407
including these "How to Speak
French" CDs we bought

05:47.461 --> 05:50.638
- so we could go to Paris.
- To be fair... to me... the reason

05:50.690 --> 05:53.224
that we haven't gone to Paris
is not because of the CDs.

05:53.309 --> 05:54.809
It's because of, oops, Taylor,

05:54.861 --> 05:55.893
then Oliver.

05:55.979 --> 05:57.328
Oops, Anna-Kat.

05:57.413 --> 05:58.612
So you're just quitting on our dream.

05:58.665 --> 06:00.031
Don't put this on me.

06:00.116 --> 06:01.916
You didn't listen
to those French CDs either.

06:03.670 --> 06:05.303
Bien sûr que je l'ai fait.

06:06.506 --> 06:07.471
Oh.

06:07.557 --> 06:08.756
You did.

06:08.808 --> 06:09.807
Why?

06:09.892 --> 06:11.142
Because I dreamed of you and I

06:11.227 --> 06:13.844
sitting in a café in Paris,
sipping wine,

06:13.930 --> 06:16.180
and ordering in French,
possibly wearing a beret.

06:16.265 --> 06:17.264
I go back and forth.

06:17.317 --> 06:19.567
Fine.

06:19.602 --> 06:21.769
I'm sorry I let you down
by not learning French.

06:21.854 --> 06:23.654
I'll make it up to you.

06:23.740 --> 06:26.407
We'll use French dressing
instead of ranch.

06:26.442 --> 06:28.943
How about you take a class
at the Education Institute?

06:29.028 --> 06:30.661
There's a French-immersion
course right next to mine.

06:30.747 --> 06:32.613
We'll be in Paris
speaking French in no time.

06:32.665 --> 06:34.582
If I take this class,

06:34.617 --> 06:36.283
will you stop calling me a quitter?

06:36.336 --> 06:38.619
If you can say
"I'm not a quitter" in French,

06:38.671 --> 06:40.621
I will stop calling you
a quitter in English.

06:40.707 --> 06:42.256
Look on the bright side.

06:42.291 --> 06:44.675
It is the language of love.

06:44.761 --> 06:46.460
Ugh. Not happening, kid.

06:50.782 --> 06:53.017
Kind of excited for French class.

06:53.133 --> 06:55.266
I'm proud of you, honey.
I'm excited for my class, too.

06:55.291 --> 06:57.174
Enrollment is down,
but my enthusiasm is up.

06:57.226 --> 06:59.143
Oh, get to use my brain
for something other than

06:59.178 --> 07:00.561
fishing people's hair out of the drain.

07:00.646 --> 07:02.613
And you're following through
and not quitting.

07:02.665 --> 07:04.365
Maybe I'll become all worldly and French

07:04.450 --> 07:06.383
and start smoking again.

07:06.419 --> 07:08.886
Katie, stop looking for excuses
to start smoking again.

07:13.276 --> 07:16.043
Veuillez retirer votre guide d'étude.

07:20.149 --> 07:21.348
I'm sorry.

07:21.434 --> 07:23.784
I did not get one of these handouts.

07:23.869 --> 07:25.419
En français, s'il vous plaît.

07:25.504 --> 07:27.371
Was I supposed to print one out at home?

07:27.456 --> 07:29.923
Because my husband has not
set up the printer, so...

07:30.009 --> 07:31.141
En français.

07:31.227 --> 07:33.827
Okay, I don't speak français.

07:33.913 --> 07:35.195
That's why I'm here.

07:35.281 --> 07:37.915
Dans cette classe,

07:37.967 --> 07:40.551
nous parlons seulement français.

07:40.603 --> 07:43.220
Are you pretending that you
don't speak English right now?

07:43.272 --> 07:46.073
Because I am not pretending
that I don't speak French.

07:46.158 --> 07:47.908
Classe?

07:47.977 --> 07:50.127
En français.

07:50.179 --> 07:52.079
Bunch of kiss asses.

07:56.485 --> 07:58.919
Well, I gave it 10 minutes.
I guess no one else is coming.

07:59.005 --> 08:01.055
Welcome to
"American History Comes Alive!"

08:01.140 --> 08:03.140
Good evening, professor!

08:03.192 --> 08:04.441
Good evening.

08:05.911 --> 08:07.111
You don't have to raise your hand.

08:07.163 --> 08:09.129
It's just you and me,
so you could just...

08:09.215 --> 08:10.964
Do you really... Yes?

08:11.050 --> 08:13.267
You, the only other person in the room.

08:13.352 --> 08:15.402
Shouldn't we begin with
the Pledge of Allegiance?

08:15.488 --> 08:17.538
Uh, yeah. Sure.

08:17.623 --> 08:19.840
Everyone, please stand.

08:20.926 --> 08:22.810
Do you, uh...

08:22.895 --> 08:23.811
Ah.

08:25.698 --> 08:27.564
"I pledge allegiance...

08:27.650 --> 08:31.301
...to the flag of
the United States of America

08:31.337 --> 08:37.274
and to the Republic for which it
stands, one nation under God,

08:37.360 --> 08:43.013
indivisible, with liberty
and justice for all."

08:43.049 --> 08:44.715
Good. I'm glad we did that.

08:44.800 --> 08:45.849
Good.

08:50.990 --> 08:52.790
I don't understand a word.

08:52.842 --> 08:55.175
I wish the teacher would teach me
phrases that I really need to know,

08:55.261 --> 08:57.361
like, "Please open this window.
I would like to jump out."

08:58.280 --> 08:59.830
- So quit.
- I can't.

08:59.865 --> 09:01.198
The only reason I'm taking this class

09:01.250 --> 09:02.750
is to prove to Greg
that I'm not a quitter.

09:02.835 --> 09:04.635
- Mm.
- Then you should ditch class.

09:04.720 --> 09:06.720
Greg would know.
He teaches right down the hall.

09:06.806 --> 09:09.273
So walk inside with him,
kiss him goodbye,

09:09.358 --> 09:10.791
then the second he's in the classroom,

09:10.876 --> 09:11.992
run outside, and we'll pick you up.

09:12.078 --> 09:14.711
- Huh.
- That is not outside my moral wheelhouse.

09:14.764 --> 09:16.713
Oh! It'll be as if we were
all friends in high school.

09:16.766 --> 09:17.815
- Aww!
- Yeah.

09:17.850 --> 09:19.767
I don't think you guys quite grasp

09:19.852 --> 09:21.785
how cool I was in high school.

09:21.821 --> 09:24.788
It's probably best we met when we did.

09:24.840 --> 09:25.839
Yeah.

09:28.811 --> 09:30.227
"Beast!

09:30.279 --> 09:32.196
"Belle! Belle, you came back!"

09:32.248 --> 09:33.831
"Of course I came back.

09:33.866 --> 09:35.616
I couldn't let them...

09:35.701 --> 09:38.218
Oh! This is all my fault!

09:38.304 --> 09:40.404
If only I'd gotten here sooner!"

09:40.439 --> 09:41.488
Stop.

09:42.608 --> 09:43.907
That was terrible.

09:43.959 --> 09:45.793
Don't listen to him. You were really...

09:47.263 --> 09:49.179
...loud.

09:49.265 --> 09:51.682
I liked how you made a choice.

09:51.734 --> 09:53.117
You think you can do better?

09:53.152 --> 09:55.986
I think it would be physically
impossible to do worse.

09:56.071 --> 09:57.321
Go for it, Belle.

09:57.373 --> 09:59.123
Ayo, read with me.

09:59.208 --> 10:01.475
Very aggressive family.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.926
You ready for class?

10:03.012 --> 10:04.011
Oui.

10:04.096 --> 10:04.895
We what?

10:04.930 --> 10:06.814
Non. Oui.

10:06.899 --> 10:08.148
We what?

10:09.952 --> 10:11.668
If only I'd gotten here sooner.

10:11.704 --> 10:13.921
Maybe it's better this way.

10:14.006 --> 10:15.923
Don't talk like that.

10:16.008 --> 10:17.257
You'll be all right.

10:17.343 --> 10:18.442
We're together now.

10:18.477 --> 10:19.977
Everything's gonna be fine.

10:20.062 --> 10:21.528
You'll see.

10:21.614 --> 10:22.863
At least I get to see you

10:22.948 --> 10:24.748
one last time.

10:24.783 --> 10:26.283
Please don't leave me.

10:26.335 --> 10:28.218
I love you.

10:28.254 --> 10:29.753
Belle, it's me.

10:30.940 --> 10:32.473
It is you.

10:37.279 --> 10:38.445
And then we kiss.

10:38.531 --> 10:41.832
Bam... It's magic.

10:41.917 --> 10:43.250
Oh, my God.

10:43.335 --> 10:44.968
He's a better princess than I am.

10:49.158 --> 10:51.325
He's either as good an actor
as Ian McKellen

10:51.410 --> 10:52.876
or as gay as Ian McKellen.

10:52.912 --> 10:55.629
I think it's pretty clear.
The cruise is back on.

10:59.351 --> 11:00.384
Madame.

11:00.436 --> 11:01.385
Oh.

11:03.389 --> 11:05.522
- Have a great class, honey.
- You too.

11:05.574 --> 11:07.541
I'm so proud of you
for sticking with it.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.576
Thank you. That means a lot.

11:23.742 --> 11:24.758
Ouille!

we could watch a movie.

11:47.066 --> 11:49.416
Benjamin Franklin was
the most influential of the...

11:49.501 --> 11:51.368
Again, Grant, you don't
have to raise your hand.

11:51.420 --> 11:52.719
It's just the two of us.

11:52.805 --> 11:54.888
Although I do appreciate
your passion for decorum.

11:54.974 --> 11:57.341
Uh, the syllabus
clearly states that today

11:57.393 --> 12:00.143
would be a guest lecture
from Benjamin Franklin.

12:00.195 --> 12:04.615
It says, like, I quote:
"History comes alive!"

12:04.667 --> 12:06.366
with the exclamation point at the end,

12:06.452 --> 12:09.052
and, you know,
this seems less than alive.

12:09.088 --> 12:11.138
Right, but "History comes alive!"

12:11.223 --> 12:13.257
plays better to a group, not just one...

12:14.727 --> 12:16.226
Are you gonna refer to the syllabus?

12:16.262 --> 12:18.228
The syllabus clearly states
that Benjamin Franklin

12:18.280 --> 12:21.064
would be in class today in person

12:21.150 --> 12:23.066
with his kite and his key.

12:31.627 --> 12:35.596
I was born on a frigid January in 1706.

12:35.681 --> 12:37.898
You don't look like Benjamin Franklin.

12:39.602 --> 12:40.934
I'll see what I can find in my car.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.069
Okay.

12:42.154 --> 12:43.904
I'm gonna read the syllabus again.

13:04.943 --> 13:08.528
minister to France, and inventor
of the urinary catheter,

13:08.614 --> 13:12.866
I passed away on April 17, 1790.

13:12.951 --> 13:14.451
I heard you died of syphilis!

13:14.536 --> 13:15.619
Myth.

13:15.671 --> 13:17.454
Although I did get a lot of action.

13:27.182 --> 13:29.766
Tomorrow night, beers
in bags under the bleachers.

13:29.802 --> 13:31.301
Cutting class is the best!

13:36.975 --> 13:38.308
Hey.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.060
Let my class out early.

13:40.145 --> 13:41.311
Where are you coming from?

13:41.363 --> 13:43.447
Well...

13:43.482 --> 13:44.981
Before you make this situation worse,

13:45.034 --> 13:46.650
I saw you get out of Angela's car.

13:46.702 --> 13:48.735
That's so funny.

13:48.821 --> 13:49.953
You see...

13:49.988 --> 13:53.156
And I heard you say,
"Cutting class is the best."

13:53.208 --> 13:54.491
Oh.

13:54.543 --> 13:55.826
And you didn't hear the rest of that.

13:55.878 --> 13:59.162
Cutting class is the best...

13:59.248 --> 14:00.497
way...

14:00.582 --> 14:02.549
to get...

14:02.634 --> 14:04.384
your husband pissed at you.

14:04.470 --> 14:05.919
I did. I cut class.

14:06.004 --> 14:07.337
Yeah.

14:12.189 --> 14:14.072
I can't believe you quit your class.

14:14.124 --> 14:15.740
Greg, I'm an adult.

14:15.792 --> 14:18.009
It's okay to quit things
when you're an adult.

14:18.045 --> 14:20.262
- Who says that? Who's your source?
- God.

14:20.347 --> 14:21.796
He quit creating things
after seven days.

14:21.882 --> 14:23.315
He could've kept going.

14:23.350 --> 14:25.267
Actually, it was six days.
On the seventh day, he rested.

14:25.352 --> 14:26.651
Oh, great. Well, then I'm not quitting.

14:26.703 --> 14:28.153
I'm resting.

14:28.238 --> 14:30.155
Look, I tried it, I didn't like it,

14:30.240 --> 14:31.790
so I stopped doing it.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.925
Why shouldn't I quit something
that's making me miserable?

14:33.961 --> 14:35.427
'Cause you're setting
a bad example for the kids.

14:35.512 --> 14:36.645
The kids don't have to know anything.

14:36.730 --> 14:37.729
We'll just lie to them.

14:37.764 --> 14:39.531
We lie to them constantly.

14:39.599 --> 14:41.366
Up until last year,
Anna-Kat thought it was illegal

14:41.401 --> 14:42.784
to watch TV during the day time.

14:42.869 --> 14:44.336
No lying and no quitting.

14:44.371 --> 14:46.371
Well, then I don't know
how to talk to our kids.

14:54.314 --> 14:55.847
Hey. I'm still talking.

14:55.932 --> 14:58.283
Well, I'm not.
I'm quitting this conversation.

14:58.335 --> 15:00.085
And, besides, face the facts...

15:00.120 --> 15:02.220
I do not need to learn French.

15:02.255 --> 15:03.638
So no Paris?

15:03.724 --> 15:05.757
We have three kids'
college tuitions to pay for.

15:05.842 --> 15:09.027
We were never gonna go to Paris.

15:10.364 --> 15:11.830
Hey.

15:11.865 --> 15:13.164
We may never get to France,

15:13.200 --> 15:15.800
but you sure have a negative
French attitude, lady.

15:19.890 --> 15:22.107
How about a bedtime story, sweetie?

15:22.142 --> 15:24.142
Can we do "Madeline"?

15:24.227 --> 15:26.528
Ooh. This is new.

15:28.248 --> 15:29.414
And in French.

15:29.466 --> 15:30.749
Daddy got it for me.

15:30.834 --> 15:32.634
I can't wait until you finish your class

15:32.719 --> 15:34.686
and can read to me in French.

15:34.721 --> 15:37.222
Oh, sweetie, I don't think
I'll ever get good enough

15:37.274 --> 15:38.523
to read a book like this.

15:38.575 --> 15:40.992
Of course you will. You can do anything.

15:41.044 --> 15:42.627
<i>Right there.</i>

15:42.662 --> 15:44.963
<i>There's the moment when telling
your kids they can do anything</i>

15:45.048 --> 15:46.598
<i>comes back to bite you on the ass.</i>

15:53.607 --> 15:55.874
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, honey.

16:01.014 --> 16:03.348
Greg!

16:03.383 --> 16:05.066
Take a seat.

16:08.021 --> 16:09.487
Okay.

16:16.480 --> 16:19.064
Son, we love you.

16:19.900 --> 16:21.366
Thanks.

16:21.401 --> 16:22.617
Love you, too.

16:22.702 --> 16:25.336
Is there anything that you would like

16:25.372 --> 16:26.838
to share with us?

16:28.091 --> 16:29.891
Is it because I'm wearing a leotard?

16:29.976 --> 16:31.760
That might be a good starting point

16:31.845 --> 16:33.478
for a larger conversation.

16:33.530 --> 16:35.914
It is okay to be who you are.

16:35.949 --> 16:37.248
That's funny.

16:37.284 --> 16:39.117
'Cause you're always
complaining about who I am.

16:39.202 --> 16:41.086
But now we realize you're gay,
so it all makes sense.

16:41.138 --> 16:44.439
- Guys, I'm not gay.
- Yes, you are.

16:44.524 --> 16:46.724
We saw your vision board with
all the half-naked guys on it.

16:46.810 --> 16:49.027
I don't know where to begin.

16:49.079 --> 16:50.361
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

16:50.414 --> 16:52.447
There is this amazing cruise.
It leaves out of Seattle.

16:52.532 --> 16:53.965
We can fly in early, have brunch.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.000
Mom, I hate to disappoint you,

16:56.086 --> 16:57.635
but I'm not gay.

16:57.721 --> 16:59.604
Then why are you going
with me on a gay cruise?

16:59.639 --> 17:01.639
Honey, let's hear him out.

17:01.691 --> 17:03.108
The vision board is my inspiration

17:03.193 --> 17:04.826
for everything I want out of my life.

17:04.911 --> 17:06.377
What about the hot guys?

17:06.413 --> 17:09.329
They're models in ads for things I want,

17:09.415 --> 17:12.884
like watches, clothes, cars, sick abs.

17:12.969 --> 17:14.685
So what's with the leotard?

17:14.738 --> 17:16.905
Well, the first step to getting
all these things I want

17:16.990 --> 17:19.656
is getting into Harvard,
also on that vision board.

17:19.709 --> 17:20.875
I'm not following you.

17:20.961 --> 17:22.877
I need more than good grades to get in.

17:22.963 --> 17:24.628
And you're not donating a library,

17:24.664 --> 17:27.499
nor do you have the decency
to be 1/16 Cherokee.

17:27.550 --> 17:28.833
Or war vets.

17:28.885 --> 17:30.218
Or anything useful.

17:30.303 --> 17:32.637
So I did some research

17:32.689 --> 17:35.306
and found out that Harvard
has a ballet troupe

17:35.392 --> 17:37.442
that's always desperate
for male dancers.

17:38.945 --> 17:41.112
So ballet is your way in.

17:41.198 --> 17:43.114
I started classes today.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.916
That is genius.

17:45.001 --> 17:46.885
Just regular genius, not evil genius,

17:46.920 --> 17:48.052
which is a nice change.

17:48.088 --> 17:49.587
Yeah, honey, that's great.

17:49.673 --> 17:52.640
I was really looking forward
to having my gay son.

17:52.726 --> 17:54.559
We're gonna love him
even though he's straight.

17:54.644 --> 17:55.894
He's still our boy.

17:55.979 --> 17:57.312
I guess.

17:57.397 --> 17:58.863
And I am proud of you.

17:58.899 --> 18:01.399
That's the kind of
"never quit" attitude I respect.

18:01.451 --> 18:02.584
Thanks, Dad.

18:02.669 --> 18:03.952
Well, I got to get going.

18:04.037 --> 18:05.537
One of us has a class to get to.

18:05.589 --> 18:07.755
It's a big night tonight.

18:07.841 --> 18:09.841
James Polk!

18:09.876 --> 18:11.709
- Right? Yeah, it's good.
- Yeah.

18:15.515 --> 18:16.981
I'm home.

18:17.017 --> 18:18.233
Bonsoir.

18:19.452 --> 18:20.818
What's all this?

18:20.871 --> 18:24.072
Honey, I'm sorry I said
we'll never get to Paris.

18:24.157 --> 18:26.624
Maybe one day we will, but until then,

18:26.660 --> 18:29.794
I thought that I would
bring Paris to us.

18:29.846 --> 18:31.695
I love it.

18:33.517 --> 18:34.933
Bonjour!

18:34.968 --> 18:37.769
Welcome to my humble Parisian café,

18:37.821 --> 18:42.357
which I built in 1965
with my charming lover, Pierre!

18:44.628 --> 18:46.888
I was wrong to encourage her
to stick with acting.

18:46.913 --> 18:48.246
So wrong.

18:50.217 --> 18:54.002
I highly recommend the beef bourguignon.

18:54.087 --> 18:55.637
Because it's all she made.

18:55.722 --> 18:57.360
Deux, s'il vous plaît.

18:59.392 --> 19:00.675
That was very authentic.

19:02.562 --> 19:06.397
And now for some
light dinner entertainment.

19:10.270 --> 19:12.437
"À Paris, dans une vieille maison

19:12.522 --> 19:14.489
aux murs recouverts de vigne."

19:14.574 --> 19:16.074
Listen to you reading French.

19:16.109 --> 19:18.526
Je ne suis pas un quitter.

19:18.612 --> 19:20.778
And speaking it.
Where did this come from?

19:20.830 --> 19:24.032
As Anna-Kat says, I can do anything.

19:24.117 --> 19:26.868
<i>Je vais à la plage.</i>

19:26.953 --> 19:29.537
Je vais à la plage.

19:29.623 --> 19:31.623
<i>Comment allez-vous?</i>

19:31.708 --> 19:33.875
Comment allez-vous?

19:33.960 --> 19:37.378
...et n'avions pas peur des cerises.

19:37.464 --> 19:39.097
Thank you for seeing this through.

19:39.132 --> 19:41.132
Taylor: Oh, great.

19:41.184 --> 19:42.433
So now that you stuck with French,

19:42.469 --> 19:43.635
I have to stick with drama?

19:43.720 --> 19:45.270
- Oui.
- "We" what?

19:50.522 --> 19:52.072
Honey, you're gonna
be late for your class.

19:52.157 --> 19:53.590
- Oh, I quit that.
- What?

19:53.659 --> 19:55.492
Hey, I'm an adult.
I'm allowed to quit things.

19:55.544 --> 19:57.844
You learned from me, I learned from you.

19:57.930 --> 19:59.963
Besides, I wrote a lesson around it.

20:00.015 --> 20:03.400
I have never been a quitter.

20:03.435 --> 20:06.269
To leave this class
before the term is completed

20:06.355 --> 20:10.320
is abhorrent to every instinct
in my body,

20:10.407 --> 20:12.048
but as professor,

20:12.144 --> 20:15.178
I must put the interests
of myself first.

20:15.230 --> 20:19.566
Therefore, I shall resign
effective at noon tomorrow.

20:19.651 --> 20:22.936
Actually, right now. Goodbye, Grant.

20:23.021 --> 20:24.904
Wait, I don't know who that
was supposed to be.

20:24.990 --> 20:26.439
I'm giving you a C-minus.

20:26.525 --> 20:28.692
Yes.
