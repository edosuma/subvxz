WEBVTT

00:20.067 --> 00:22.500
40...

00:22.567 --> 00:24.500
40.

00:24.567 --> 00:26.533
"Hi. I'm 40."

00:26.600 --> 00:27.733
"How old are you, Ricky?"

00:27.800 --> 00:28.800
"Oh, I'm 40."

00:28.867 --> 00:31.900
"Nah, nah, Ricky can't be 40."

00:31.967 --> 00:35.333
"Rick is 40."

00:35.400 --> 00:37.333
"Macho, cool Rick.

00:37.400 --> 00:39.000
He's 40."

00:39.067 --> 00:43.433
"40-year-old Rick."

00:43.500 --> 00:45.067
Yeah.

00:49.600 --> 00:51.600
40 seems so old.

00:51.667 --> 00:52.767
Totally,

00:52.833 --> 00:54.500
but Papi's
in great shape.

00:54.567 --> 00:55.667
Agreed.

00:55.733 --> 00:57.133
A perfect
40-year-old specimen.

00:57.200 --> 01:00.533
"I'm a professional
ball player."

01:01.733 --> 01:03.367
Powww!

01:05.767 --> 01:06.633
Thanks, Mir.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.067
No problem.

01:09.100 --> 01:10.500
I hope we're doing
the right thing.

01:10.567 --> 01:11.500
I know.

01:11.567 --> 01:12.533
We are.

01:12.600 --> 01:14.067
Daddy needs our help.

01:14.067 --> 01:15.067
We have our strategy,

01:15.067 --> 01:16.667
we have our
talking points,

01:16.733 --> 01:17.733
and we have each other.

01:17.800 --> 01:18.700
Let's do this.

01:18.767 --> 01:21.633
Go, team!

01:30.833 --> 01:31.800
Oh!

01:32.967 --> 01:34.900
Buenos días, chicas.

01:34.967 --> 01:37.533
Must have been some game.

01:37.600 --> 01:39.767
You look really overdressed
for bingo, Abuela.

01:39.833 --> 01:41.633
There was dancing!

01:41.700 --> 01:44.067
Was it The Forbidden Dance?

01:44.133 --> 01:45.700
Did you sleep
at bingo, Abuela?

01:45.767 --> 01:48.067
I did.

01:48.133 --> 01:49.667
The game ran late.

01:49.733 --> 01:51.133
There were cots,

01:51.200 --> 01:53.500
and now I'm going upstairs
to change.

01:53.567 --> 01:55.500
Ay caramba.

01:58.900 --> 02:01.600
Feliz cumpleaños,¡
ringo.g

02:01.667 --> 02:03.133
Ah, gracias , Rosa.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.133
Worst accent ever.

02:04.200 --> 02:05.967
What are you wearing?

02:06.067 --> 02:07.100
Sequins.

02:07.167 --> 02:08.200
That's an interesting
choice

02:08.267 --> 02:09.767
for 8:00 a.m.
on a Saturday.

02:09.833 --> 02:11.100
That's why I'm here.

02:11.167 --> 02:12.967
I don't want it to happen
again.

02:13.067 --> 02:14.267
It's not that bad.

02:14.333 --> 02:15.600
I mean,
it's a little form-fitting,

02:15.667 --> 02:16.500
but, you know...

02:16.567 --> 02:17.133
scuchame.E

02:17.200 --> 02:18.133
Listen.

02:18.200 --> 02:19.233
I do not want

02:19.300 --> 02:21.200
to have to do
the walk of shame

02:21.267 --> 02:22.867
in front
of my granddaughters

02:22.933 --> 02:25.200
if I feel
like staying out late.

02:25.267 --> 02:27.067
What are you saying?

02:27.067 --> 02:29.700
I am finding my own place.

02:29.767 --> 02:30.567
It's time.

02:30.633 --> 02:31.833
Oh, ho-ho-ho! Nope.

02:31.900 --> 02:32.833
No, no, no, no, no.

02:32.900 --> 02:34.067
Not happening.

02:34.067 --> 02:36.067
I do not accept
your resignation.

02:36.100 --> 02:37.100
I need you.

02:37.167 --> 02:38.167
They need you.

02:38.233 --> 02:39.933
I can't do it
without you.

02:40.067 --> 02:42.600
You know, soon they're going
to be dating...

02:42.667 --> 02:43.567
and boys...

02:43.633 --> 02:45.200
and more dating and make-up

02:45.267 --> 02:46.900
and prom dresses

02:46.967 --> 02:48.400
and then they're going
to want to drive...

02:48.467 --> 02:49.933
cars!

02:50.067 --> 02:52.133
Cars and boys!

02:52.200 --> 02:53.633
Obviously, nuh-uh.

02:53.700 --> 02:54.767
You're not going anywhere.

02:54.833 --> 02:56.200
Watch me.

02:56.267 --> 02:57.967
No, this has got to be
the worst birthday ever.

02:58.067 --> 03:00.867
Happy Birthday,
Daddy!

03:00.933 --> 03:04.233
Oh! Best
birthday ever!

03:04.300 --> 03:05.667
Make a wish, Daddy.

03:05.733 --> 03:07.267
Don't leave.

03:07.333 --> 03:08.667
Wishes are meant
to be secret,

03:08.733 --> 03:09.967
but we're not going
anywhere.

03:10.067 --> 03:12.067
Oh, my life is over.

03:12.133 --> 03:13.100
Don't be silly,
Papi.

03:13.167 --> 03:14.500
Well, I mean,
you're old,

03:14.567 --> 03:15.600
but not that old.

03:15.667 --> 03:17.967
Life expectancy
is climbing, Daddy.

03:18.067 --> 03:19.200
You've got plenty of time.

03:19.267 --> 03:20.800
Oh.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.167
Today is the first day
of the rest of your life.

03:24.533 --> 03:25.567
Bye, all.

03:25.633 --> 03:27.067
Oh-ho-ho...

03:29.633 --> 03:30.733
Wait. What's with the nod?

03:30.800 --> 03:31.900
It's go time.

03:33.633 --> 03:34.633
Oh.

03:37.067 --> 03:39.767
Daddy, we have
to talk to you.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.233
It's important. Muy.

03:42.667 --> 03:43.967
What up, my pretty posse?

03:46.267 --> 03:48.733
What? I can't say that?

03:48.800 --> 03:50.200
Which part?

03:50.267 --> 03:51.600
Both parts.

03:51.667 --> 03:53.067
"What up" and "pretty posse".

03:53.067 --> 03:54.067
Both.

03:54.100 --> 03:55.133
Okay. Okay, I got it.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.233
What's going on?

03:56.300 --> 03:57.733
It's your
40th birthday

03:57.800 --> 03:59.300
and you're not getting
any younger.

03:59.367 --> 04:00.767
We've seen the Rogaine.

04:00.833 --> 04:02.067
And the last
shred of dignity

04:02.067 --> 04:03.200
bites the dust.

04:03.267 --> 04:04.933
Another no
on "bites the dust".

04:05.067 --> 04:06.167
Oh.

04:06.233 --> 04:08.067
Daddy, we want you
to be happy.

04:08.133 --> 04:10.067
We want you
to fall in love.

04:11.067 --> 04:12.167
We also want you

04:12.233 --> 04:13.233
to get a haircut,

04:13.300 --> 04:14.333
lose the "dad jeans",

04:14.400 --> 04:15.533
and buy a blue blazer.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.967
Wow. Wow.

04:17.067 --> 04:18.200
It's going to be a busy day,

04:18.267 --> 04:19.867
and, you know,
I don't wear "dad jeans".

04:23.867 --> 04:26.733
It's been three years
since mom died.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.933
You need
to get out there.

04:32.400 --> 04:33.967
I met your mom
in the ninth grade.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.633
I don't even know
where "out there" is.

04:38.700 --> 04:41.333
She was my girl.

04:48.067 --> 04:49.400
As hard as it is
to imagine,

04:49.467 --> 04:51.067
there are
other girls...

04:51.133 --> 04:53.067
maybe not like Mom,
but there are.

04:53.133 --> 04:55.533
Plenty of fish.

04:55.600 --> 04:57.067
Yeah, okay, okay.

04:57.100 --> 04:58.100
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

04:58.167 --> 05:00.100
I got it.
I hear you. Okay.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.067
Whoo.

05:01.133 --> 05:02.267
Wait.

05:02.333 --> 05:03.833
What's your take-away, Daddy?

05:03.900 --> 05:05.300
Eight-year-olds don't say
"What's your take-away?"

05:05.367 --> 05:06.767
That's my take-away!

05:06.833 --> 05:08.233
Now, go deliver a TED Talk
or something.

05:08.300 --> 05:10.400
I'm going to go brush my teeth
and put on my Rogaine.

05:15.067 --> 05:16.767
I think that went well.

05:19.367 --> 05:20.333
What?

05:35.833 --> 05:37.367
Ugh.

05:39.933 --> 05:41.333
Gigi?

05:45.067 --> 05:46.633
I'm fairly certain
these belong to you.

05:46.700 --> 05:47.767
Why are they in here?

05:47.833 --> 05:48.800
They're at a spa retreat

05:48.867 --> 05:49.967
from their high-stress,

05:50.067 --> 05:51.633
yet fulfilling
executive positions

05:51.700 --> 05:54.233
at Fortune 500 companies.

05:54.300 --> 05:55.367
They were taking a Jacuzzi,

05:55.433 --> 05:56.833
and later,
they have Pilates.

05:56.900 --> 05:58.233
Right. Makes perfect sense.

05:58.300 --> 06:00.200
It's important
to work hard,

06:00.267 --> 06:01.833
but they also
have to relax.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.767
Everyone's so scheduled
these days,

06:04.833 --> 06:06.067
we all just need
to slow down.

06:06.100 --> 06:07.167
Of course.

06:07.233 --> 06:08.200
Carry on.

06:13.867 --> 06:14.800
Wow.

06:14.867 --> 06:16.800
You see that one, Isabella?

06:16.867 --> 06:19.467
And she might be our easiest.

06:19.533 --> 06:22.367
How am I going
to raise our girls on my own?

06:28.467 --> 06:29.767
You don't have to.

06:54.933 --> 06:56.733
Focus on the ball.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.233
Keep your head in the game.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.333
Focus on the ball.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.400
Focus.

07:03.933 --> 07:05.333
Still here.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.267
What-- What--
What is going on?

07:08.333 --> 07:10.900
What is going on?

07:15.900 --> 07:17.333
You talk to me
all the time.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.400
Today, I answered.

07:18.467 --> 07:19.567
No biggie.

07:19.633 --> 07:21.167
No biggie?

07:21.233 --> 07:22.400
Oh, ho-ho,
au contraire ,

07:22.467 --> 07:24.100
no, it's-- it's
an enormous b-biggie,

07:24.167 --> 07:26.967
mainly because I--
I'm sitting on my bathtub

07:27.067 --> 07:29.900
talking to my dead wife.

07:38.200 --> 07:40.433
Sorry.
Forgot their juice cleanser.

07:52.300 --> 07:56.167
And early-onset dementia
is upon us...

08:13.567 --> 08:15.067
Happy birthday, boss.

08:15.133 --> 08:16.300
Whatever.

08:16.367 --> 08:17.367
-Really?
-I'm in a mood.

08:17.433 --> 08:19.067
Yes, I see that.

08:19.133 --> 08:20.933
It's very endearing.

08:21.067 --> 08:23.300
How about a "Hey, Steph,
how's school going?"

08:24.533 --> 08:25.800
Ah, I'm sorry.

08:25.867 --> 08:26.800
How's it going, Steph?

08:26.867 --> 08:29.167
Well, since you asked,

08:29.233 --> 08:31.867
I should have my Ph.D.
in clinical sports psychology

08:31.933 --> 08:33.500
in, oh, about eight years.

08:33.567 --> 08:34.267
Come on,
don't be dramatic.

08:34.333 --> 08:35.833
Try four.

08:35.900 --> 08:37.133
Has my brother come in yet?

08:37.200 --> 08:38.367
Uh, yeah.
He's in the locker room.

08:38.433 --> 08:39.900
Could you go get him
for me, please?

08:39.967 --> 08:41.467
-No.
-Excuse me?

08:41.533 --> 08:43.533
Ricky, he's in
the locker room.

08:44.533 --> 08:46.567
The men's locker room!

08:46.633 --> 08:48.233
Right,

08:48.300 --> 08:51.800
and it's Rick...
from now on.

08:51.867 --> 08:53.767
Okay.

08:53.833 --> 08:54.533
Rick.

08:55.633 --> 08:57.333
There he is!

08:57.400 --> 08:58.267
The birthday boss!

08:58.333 --> 08:59.267
He's right there.

08:59.333 --> 09:00.333
Sh-kk-powww!

09:00.400 --> 09:01.567
And may I just say

09:01.633 --> 09:04.200
how especially young you look
this morning.

09:04.267 --> 09:05.100
I'm going to stop you
right there.

09:05.167 --> 09:06.533
Not in the mood.

09:06.600 --> 09:07.567
Go get my brother for me.

09:07.633 --> 09:08.433
-Sure. Yeah.
-Please.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.367
Yeah, okay. Okay.

09:09.433 --> 09:10.933
All right.

09:11.067 --> 09:12.600
Whoo, someone's a little
Snippy McSnippersons

09:12.667 --> 09:14.067
this morning, huh?

09:14.133 --> 09:15.967
-Go on.
-Yeah, I'm going to get him now.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.933
Good. It's official.

09:29.067 --> 09:31.067
I've lost my mind
on my 40th birthday.

09:31.133 --> 09:32.067
Yay, me.

09:32.133 --> 09:33.067
We need to talk.

09:33.100 --> 09:33.900
No, I can't hear you.

09:33.967 --> 09:34.900
I can't hear you.

09:34.967 --> 09:36.100
I can't hear
my dead wife.

09:38.467 --> 09:39.333
The girls are right.

09:39.400 --> 09:40.967
It's time...

09:41.067 --> 09:41.900
Time you move on.

09:43.500 --> 09:44.533
Hey.

09:49.067 --> 09:51.300
I'm having
a medical thing.

09:51.367 --> 09:53.933
Why? What's going on?

09:54.067 --> 09:56.200
Do you see that?

09:56.267 --> 09:58.333
What?

10:00.233 --> 10:01.500
I hit my head
this morning.

10:01.567 --> 10:03.367
I... I feel strange.

10:03.433 --> 10:04.933
I'm seeing things.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.933
Maybe I have a brain tumor.

10:07.000 --> 10:08.967
Oh, well, sure,
yeah, that's it.

10:10.267 --> 10:11.533
Calm down.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.100
Kidding.

10:13.167 --> 10:15.267
All right,
on your feet, little brother.

10:15.333 --> 10:17.100
Dr. Bill is in the house.

10:18.033 --> 10:20.167
Oh!

10:20.233 --> 10:21.500
I'm not one of your patients.
I'm not five.

10:21.567 --> 10:22.733
Okay, okay.

10:22.800 --> 10:24.567
All right,
where'd you bang it?

10:27.133 --> 10:28.067
What, right there?

10:28.133 --> 10:29.367
Mm.

10:29.433 --> 10:30.400
Ow, that hurts my neck.

10:30.467 --> 10:31.633
Okay, uh,
how many fingers?

10:31.700 --> 10:32.567
Three.

10:32.633 --> 10:33.500
-Now?
-Two.

10:33.567 --> 10:34.433
-Now?
-One.

10:34.500 --> 10:35.300
-Now?
-Four.

10:35.367 --> 10:36.467
-Now?
-Look...

10:36.533 --> 10:38.133
Listen, I'm...
seeing things.

10:38.200 --> 10:40.833
What kind of things?

10:40.900 --> 10:42.300
Dead wife things.

10:42.367 --> 10:43.333
Stop!

10:44.300 --> 10:45.167
S-sorry.

10:45.233 --> 10:46.233
It's nothing. Just...

10:46.300 --> 10:48.333
I don't feel well.

10:50.233 --> 10:54.433
Uh, okay. Rick, um...

10:54.500 --> 10:59.167
Let's talk about stress.

10:59.233 --> 11:00.200
What's going on?

11:00.267 --> 11:01.200
Well, uh...

11:01.267 --> 11:03.500
this morning, Rosa,

11:03.567 --> 11:06.100
who you know I rely on
for every moment of every day,

11:06.167 --> 11:07.500
told me that she's moving out,

11:07.567 --> 11:09.500
and the girls
want me to start dating,

11:09.567 --> 11:11.067
and as you
also know,

11:11.067 --> 11:12.533
today is my 40th birthday,

11:12.600 --> 11:14.600
and oh, right,
I use Rogaine.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.067
Rick,
you don't have a brain tumor.

11:18.067 --> 11:19.733
You're having "a day",

11:19.800 --> 11:22.200
like Mom
likes to call it.

11:22.267 --> 11:24.467
I suggest
maybe going for a run

11:24.533 --> 11:26.100
or for a swim or a steam,

11:26.167 --> 11:27.667
or maybe some Xanax.

11:29.567 --> 11:30.733
Kidding.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.133
Look, Jackie and I
were talking about you

11:33.200 --> 11:35.400
this morning, and...

11:35.467 --> 11:38.533
and 40 is a big one.

11:38.600 --> 11:40.467
I mean, that milestone
can be daunting,

11:40.533 --> 11:42.267
especially alone.

11:42.333 --> 11:45.600
I have the girls and Rosa
and you and Jackie.

11:45.667 --> 11:47.400
That's not enough.

11:47.467 --> 11:49.633
Look, I know life
hasn't been the same for you

11:49.700 --> 11:52.233
since Isabella died,

11:52.300 --> 11:55.233
and probably will never be,

11:55.300 --> 11:58.067
and that's normal,

11:58.067 --> 11:59.400
but the thing is,

11:59.467 --> 12:02.567
there are a lot
of happy memories ahead,

12:02.633 --> 12:07.100
and there will be love,
in the form of a woman.

12:07.167 --> 12:09.067
I know this,

12:09.100 --> 12:10.500
and I guess
the girls do too.

12:11.767 --> 12:13.067
Ha, ha. Really.

12:13.133 --> 12:14.467
I've got to tell you,

12:14.533 --> 12:15.667
and don't think
I haven't thought about it,

12:15.733 --> 12:17.167
and as much as I do
think about it,

12:17.233 --> 12:19.300
it always ends the same way
with the same thought...

12:19.367 --> 12:22.500
I can't imagine

12:22.567 --> 12:24.600
ever being as in love

12:24.667 --> 12:27.567
or happy or comfortable
with a woman

12:27.633 --> 12:29.733
like I was with Isabella.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.267
Over 20 years,

12:31.333 --> 12:32.600
my entire adult life.

12:32.667 --> 12:34.200
Look,

12:34.267 --> 12:39.300
stress, anxiety,
lack of sleep, dehydration,

12:39.367 --> 12:40.767
they can all cause
hallucination,

12:40.833 --> 12:43.100
you know,
the "seeing" things.

12:43.167 --> 12:46.400
The remedy, Rick, is life.

12:48.367 --> 12:50.433
Get out there, man,
and live it.

12:58.300 --> 12:59.700
I hate you.

12:59.767 --> 13:02.367
I hate you too.

13:04.167 --> 13:05.500
See you at 7:00.

13:05.567 --> 13:06.633
What do you mean?

13:06.700 --> 13:07.833
You know about
the surprise party?

13:07.900 --> 13:09.167
They throw me one
every year.

13:09.233 --> 13:10.500
It's no longer a surprise.

13:11.533 --> 13:12.833
I don't get it.

13:16.567 --> 13:18.200
I'm telling you,
you're not gonna bulk up.

13:19.567 --> 13:20.667
You just need
to do cardio,

13:20.733 --> 13:21.600
and then weights.

13:21.667 --> 13:22.667
Okay.

13:28.200 --> 13:30.133
Thanks.

13:30.200 --> 13:31.800
Sorry I was cranky.

13:31.867 --> 13:33.633
I'm hoping you'll relax.

13:33.700 --> 13:35.300
I put a shot of Cuervo
in there.

13:36.567 --> 13:38.600
Of course I didn't.

13:38.667 --> 13:39.667
Okay,

13:39.733 --> 13:41.367
you have a client
at 10:00,

13:41.433 --> 13:42.500
and then you're free

13:42.567 --> 13:43.600
to spend
the rest of your birthday

13:43.667 --> 13:45.567
with your girls.

13:45.633 --> 13:47.700
So why are you cranky?

13:50.400 --> 13:52.167
The girls want me
to start dating.

13:52.233 --> 13:53.233
Wow.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.667
Wow! Wow!

13:54.733 --> 13:56.800
That's a lot of wows, Steph.

13:56.867 --> 13:58.500
Mm.
Do you have a blue blazer?

13:58.567 --> 14:01.200
What is it
with the blue blazer?

14:01.267 --> 14:02.433
Very versatile.

14:02.500 --> 14:05.300
Looks good with jeans
or slacks...

14:05.367 --> 14:07.367
khakis too, but no pleats.

14:07.433 --> 14:08.300
Smart girl.

14:08.367 --> 14:09.233
I hate pleats.

14:09.300 --> 14:12.233
Got it. No pleats.

14:12.300 --> 14:13.567
You think I can't date?

14:13.633 --> 14:14.867
I'm not the dating type?

14:14.933 --> 14:16.500
No, that's not it...

14:16.567 --> 14:17.767
at all.

14:17.833 --> 14:18.933
Ricky,

14:19.067 --> 14:20.533
I have worked for you
for two years,

14:20.600 --> 14:22.400
and you haven't gone out
on one date,

14:22.467 --> 14:25.200
at least that
I've known about.

14:25.267 --> 14:27.467
There's been no dating,

14:27.533 --> 14:29.900
and we all can't be
as socially active as you,

14:29.967 --> 14:31.233
Steph.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.867
A woman's got to kiss
a lot of frogs

14:32.933 --> 14:35.333
to meet a prince...

14:35.400 --> 14:38.267
or a guy with a job...

14:38.333 --> 14:40.267
or a car.

14:40.333 --> 14:41.533
You are a catch.

14:43.300 --> 14:44.100
Go on.

14:44.167 --> 14:45.400
Well,

14:45.467 --> 14:47.367
you're an ex-professional
baseball player,

14:47.433 --> 14:48.667
handsome, fit,

14:48.733 --> 14:50.833
you own
your own business,

14:50.900 --> 14:54.333
and you have
a really nice house...

14:54.400 --> 14:56.567
and you have
three amazing daughters.

14:56.633 --> 14:58.767
You're like
a killer whale

14:58.833 --> 15:00.700
in a sea of plankton.

15:00.767 --> 15:01.733
You're right.

15:01.800 --> 15:03.667
I am a catch!

15:05.067 --> 15:06.567
Guys, look what
I found on eBay.

15:06.633 --> 15:09.267
You were marked down
to $3.99,

15:09.333 --> 15:10.967
and there are more
if we want 'em,

15:11.067 --> 15:14.267
like a whole warehouse full
of these things.

15:14.333 --> 15:15.467
Way to go.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.400
What?

15:18.400 --> 15:20.200
Oh, I-- Uh, Ricky!

15:20.267 --> 15:21.500
Boss, boss!

15:21.567 --> 15:22.900
No, no. I'm sorry.

15:22.967 --> 15:26.633
Shh.

15:35.400 --> 15:36.967
Thank you all for coming.

15:38.433 --> 15:39.933
You will find
water bottles and fruit

15:40.067 --> 15:42.467
on the credenza.

15:42.533 --> 15:43.767
That means dresser.

15:43.833 --> 15:46.233
You always think
I don't know things.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.600
Did you know it?

15:47.667 --> 15:49.900
Maybe.

15:49.967 --> 15:51.933
Back to the task
at hand, please.

15:52.067 --> 15:54.867
Look, he's never going
to do this on his own.

15:54.933 --> 15:56.767
We're going to take matters
into our own hands,

15:56.833 --> 15:58.533
right here, right now.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.800
I think we're right on target
with our strategy.

16:00.867 --> 16:03.267
We're going to need
a sign-up sheet, with columns,

16:03.333 --> 16:04.667
for all of their information.

16:04.733 --> 16:06.967
I've taken the liberty
of printing some out.

16:08.767 --> 16:10.733
Mirabel?

16:11.800 --> 16:13.233
Mirabel!

16:13.300 --> 16:14.633
He's at the wrong window.

16:14.700 --> 16:18.367
You two are clearly
made for one another.

16:21.600 --> 16:23.400
Hey, Cole.

16:23.467 --> 16:24.600
Hey, yourself.

16:24.667 --> 16:26.333
We're doing a lemonade stand.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.100
Come by.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.900
Will do, beautiful.

16:32.067 --> 16:34.700
The "will do, beautiful"
is a little cheesy,

16:34.767 --> 16:35.667
don't you think?

16:35.733 --> 16:37.400
You're just jealous.

16:37.467 --> 16:39.067
Yes, I've always
wanted a boyfriend

16:39.100 --> 16:41.367
who wears the same shirt
every day.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.333
What could you possibly
be doing?

16:48.400 --> 16:49.233
I'm trying to see
how I look,

16:49.300 --> 16:50.333
like, upside down.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.600
You know, to Cole,

16:51.667 --> 16:53.800
when I'm leaning
out the window.

16:53.867 --> 16:56.867
Not like Juliet on the balcony,
I can tell you that much.

16:56.933 --> 16:58.367
Who?

16:58.433 --> 16:59.833
Above your pay grade.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.067
You know what's above
your pay grade?

17:02.067 --> 17:03.567
A boyfriend.

17:03.633 --> 17:04.567
That's what.

17:04.633 --> 17:06.567
At least I have one.

17:12.367 --> 17:14.800
I'm sorry, Elisa.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.833
Lo siento.

17:16.900 --> 17:19.100
You'll find a boyfriend,
I promise.

17:19.167 --> 17:20.633
How do you get one?

17:20.700 --> 17:21.600
A boyfriend.

17:21.667 --> 17:23.067
It's weird.

17:23.133 --> 17:24.367
They just come to me.

17:24.433 --> 17:25.300
Not helping.

17:25.367 --> 17:27.967
Boy lesson number one.

17:30.667 --> 17:31.900
Don't be nice.

17:31.967 --> 17:33.467
What? That's crazy.

17:33.533 --> 17:34.767
Daddy always says

17:34.833 --> 17:36.467
the thing
that attracted him to Mom

17:36.533 --> 17:38.567
was that although
she was the smartest

17:38.633 --> 17:39.867
and most popular girl
in ninth grade,

17:39.933 --> 17:41.333
she was also the nicest.

17:41.400 --> 17:42.733
And you believed him?

17:42.800 --> 17:43.833
Mom was hot.

17:43.900 --> 17:44.800
Mom was nice.

17:44.867 --> 17:45.733
Well, I'm not.

17:45.800 --> 17:46.967
Not with boys.

17:47.067 --> 17:48.500
They like it when
you're mean to them,

17:48.567 --> 17:50.400
ignore them,
and don't care.

17:50.467 --> 17:52.133
She may have a point.

17:52.200 --> 17:54.400
Males of most species,
except for lions and eagles,

17:54.467 --> 17:56.067
like to hunt,
to chase.

17:56.133 --> 17:57.700
They like to prove
that they're Alpha.

17:59.900 --> 18:01.667
Animal Planet. Hello.

18:01.733 --> 18:02.767
Okay, enough.

18:02.833 --> 18:03.800
Task at hand,

18:03.867 --> 18:04.967
like the mini-genius said.

18:05.067 --> 18:06.067
Task at hand.

18:13.100 --> 18:14.233
Hey.

18:14.300 --> 18:15.833
Hey, what's up
for this afternoon?

18:15.900 --> 18:16.767
Batting practice?

18:16.833 --> 18:18.433
Can't. We have plans.

18:18.500 --> 18:19.667
On my birthday?

18:19.733 --> 18:20.733
We're going to have
a lemonade stand.

18:20.800 --> 18:21.933
To raise money. For charity.

18:22.067 --> 18:24.500
Not for any other purpose
at all.

18:25.933 --> 18:26.833
Well, I guess
if it's for charity...

18:26.900 --> 18:28.267
We need
your help, Papi.

18:28.333 --> 18:29.900
Will you put together
the table in the rec room?

18:29.967 --> 18:31.233
Sure.

18:31.300 --> 18:33.567
What exactly
are you raising money for?

18:33.633 --> 18:34.533
Children in Sudan.

18:34.600 --> 18:35.467
My school.

18:35.533 --> 18:37.067
A new sweater...

18:38.500 --> 18:41.100
...for children in Sudan.

18:41.167 --> 18:42.867
They need sweaters.

18:42.933 --> 18:45.100
Ah.

18:45.167 --> 18:46.667
I see, I see.

18:46.733 --> 18:48.233
I need to go speak
to your grandmother.

18:48.300 --> 18:49.933
I'll put the table together
afterwards, okay?

18:54.800 --> 18:55.833
Really?

18:55.900 --> 18:57.833
Sweaters in Sudan?

19:04.833 --> 19:07.133
The girls
are up to something.

19:07.200 --> 19:08.667
I hope
it's not a surprise party.

19:08.733 --> 19:09.700
Well, look around.

19:09.767 --> 19:10.600
We're having a party
for you.

19:10.667 --> 19:11.667
It's no surprise.

19:11.733 --> 19:13.133
Everyone will be here at 7:00.

19:14.100 --> 19:15.833
Later, you eat. Not now.

19:15.900 --> 19:18.700
I am making a very special
dinner for you.

19:18.767 --> 19:20.233
More like a last supper.

19:20.300 --> 19:21.233
Oh, please, chico.

19:21.300 --> 19:23.067
Rosa, don't leave.

19:23.133 --> 19:24.967
You know, if you move out,
there's no more family dinners.

19:25.067 --> 19:27.900
People who don't live together
can have dinner, Ricky.

19:27.967 --> 19:28.833
You're a relatively
smart man.

19:28.900 --> 19:29.767
You know this.

19:29.833 --> 19:30.833
Yeah, yeah,

19:30.900 --> 19:32.167
but what about movie night?

19:32.233 --> 19:33.600
Game night?

19:33.667 --> 19:35.133
Poker night? Hmm?

19:35.200 --> 19:37.533
I want more "bingo" nights.

19:39.133 --> 19:41.933
Can I ask you
a personal question?

19:42.067 --> 19:43.800
Just a little Botox
around the eyes.

19:43.867 --> 19:45.067
No, not about that,

19:45.100 --> 19:48.300
and I know
it's not just Botox.

19:48.367 --> 19:49.467
You want me to leave
before dinner?

19:49.533 --> 19:50.800
No, no. Sorry.

19:50.867 --> 19:52.433
You're gorgeous. You know this.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.667
I do.

19:53.733 --> 19:54.700
It's just...

19:54.767 --> 19:55.633
I'm a little
freaked out,

19:55.700 --> 19:56.833
and I wanted to ask you--

19:56.900 --> 19:58.700
and don't think I'm crazy--

19:58.767 --> 20:01.100
but, um...

20:01.167 --> 20:04.800
do you believe...
in spirits?

20:04.867 --> 20:06.033
Of course.

20:06.100 --> 20:06.967
Of course?

20:07.033 --> 20:08.433
I am Latina.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.433
Did you not notice this?

20:09.500 --> 20:10.600
Okay, okay.

20:10.667 --> 20:12.533
Do you ever talk to them?

20:12.600 --> 20:13.667
I do.

20:13.733 --> 20:15.067
It's good for the soul.

20:15.133 --> 20:18.567
I talk to my mother, my husband,
my daughter...

20:19.600 --> 20:20.733
Okay.

20:20.800 --> 20:23.867
Do they ever, um...

20:23.933 --> 20:26.233
I can't believe
I'm saying this out loud.

20:26.300 --> 20:31.033
Do they ever talk back?

20:31.100 --> 20:33.500
Uh-huh... Listen.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.967
How can I put this?

20:38.033 --> 20:40.800
If a spirit comes to you,
it's because you need help.

20:40.867 --> 20:43.067
Your need calls to them,

20:43.133 --> 20:44.867
and you definitely
need help, hijo.

20:44.933 --> 20:46.167
Go on.

20:46.233 --> 20:47.700
I'm listening.

20:47.767 --> 20:49.133
Well, it's not about
them. It's about you.

20:49.200 --> 20:52.500
They only exist to guide us,
like our subconscious,

20:52.567 --> 20:54.067
and they live here,

20:54.133 --> 20:56.867
right here.

20:56.933 --> 21:00.933
So are they, um, are they real?

21:01.067 --> 21:02.700
Oh, they are real to you,

21:02.767 --> 21:03.900
and that's all that matters.

21:03.967 --> 21:04.967
They exist for you,

21:05.067 --> 21:06.967
and not without you,

21:07.067 --> 21:08.067
and the good part
is, hijo ,

21:08.100 --> 21:11.100
they will come
if you need help.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.067
What do I need help with?

21:20.733 --> 21:24.200
Seriously, seriously,
you have a list?

21:24.267 --> 21:26.700
Oh, I've been working on that
for some time.

21:26.767 --> 21:28.133
Listen, listen,

21:28.200 --> 21:29.200
what if there was a way
that you could stay here

21:29.267 --> 21:30.233
but have your own place?

21:32.333 --> 21:34.067
What if I built you
a guest house?

21:34.067 --> 21:35.133
Then I'd be a guest.

21:35.200 --> 21:36.867
No. Now, just leave.

21:36.933 --> 21:38.067
Go on.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.700
I am trying
to make dinner here.

21:39.767 --> 21:41.833
Man, there are some bossy women
in this house.

21:41.900 --> 21:43.267
¡Ay!

21:50.733 --> 21:52.667
Happy Beer-day, dude!

21:52.733 --> 21:54.067
Hi.

21:54.067 --> 21:56.067
I think it's still "birthday",
Todd.

21:56.067 --> 21:57.700
Is it, though?

21:57.767 --> 22:01.333
I like a birthday,
but I prefer a beer day.

22:01.633 --> 22:03.067
No?

22:03.100 --> 22:04.333
Am I wrong with this?

22:04.400 --> 22:06.333
I mean, where would we be
without beer?

22:06.400 --> 22:07.833
Not happy,
I can tell you that,

22:07.900 --> 22:09.800
but you take birthdays away,

22:09.867 --> 22:13.900
and we just stay
young and hot.

22:13.967 --> 22:15.600
Is that the way
you see yourself?

22:15.667 --> 22:16.567
Young and hot?

22:16.633 --> 22:18.067
I do.

22:18.067 --> 22:19.067
Okay.

22:19.067 --> 22:20.833
I, however, am 40 today.

22:20.900 --> 22:22.067
No longer young.

22:22.100 --> 22:23.200
No longer hot.

22:23.267 --> 22:26.633
No, dude, I get it.

22:26.700 --> 22:27.700
So you've got
a few years on me.

22:27.767 --> 22:29.800
I know how that must feel,

22:29.867 --> 22:33.233
but if you take care
of yourself like I do,

22:33.300 --> 22:34.300
you could get
the hot back.

22:34.367 --> 22:36.967
Ricky Cooper at 40,
gets the hot back.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.933
Mm, help me out
with this table.

22:42.067 --> 22:42.967
I'm old and weak.

22:43.067 --> 22:43.867
Lemonade stand?

22:43.933 --> 22:45.633
You know it.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.900
Our lives
are so predictable.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.733
Well, my life became
a little less predictable

22:49.800 --> 22:50.633
today.

22:50.700 --> 22:51.600
Bring it.

22:53.300 --> 22:56.200
The girls want me
to start dating.

22:58.133 --> 22:59.167
Whoa, whoa, wha...

22:59.233 --> 23:00.800
What's happening
over there?

23:00.867 --> 23:02.067
It looks like someone
just gave you a puppy.

23:02.100 --> 23:05.733
Someone did, man,
someone just did.

23:06.800 --> 23:08.867
Okay, okay, Todd, Todd...

23:08.933 --> 23:10.200
Todd, you're dancing.

23:10.267 --> 23:11.733
This is some danceworthy
news, my friend...

23:11.800 --> 23:13.800
and I finish with a twirl.

23:13.867 --> 23:15.967
Okay, okay, enlighten me.

23:16.067 --> 23:18.833
This is just the opportunity
that we have been waiting for.

23:18.900 --> 23:20.133
We?

23:20.200 --> 23:22.600
The world,
my 40-year-old friend,

23:22.667 --> 23:23.633
is our oyster.

23:23.700 --> 23:24.700
Todd, you're married.

23:24.767 --> 23:27.100
You-- You have no oysters.

23:27.167 --> 23:29.067
Oh, but there's where
you're mistaken, Ricardo.

23:29.133 --> 23:30.167
From now on,

23:30.233 --> 23:32.067
from this moment
going forward,

23:32.133 --> 23:33.700
I get to live vicariously
through you.

23:33.767 --> 23:35.967
How-- How do you figure?

23:39.333 --> 23:41.933
You are the king
of the world, my friend.

23:42.067 --> 23:44.633
Go forth and conquer...

23:44.700 --> 23:45.767
a lot,

23:45.833 --> 23:47.167
and tell me about it...

23:47.233 --> 23:48.300
in detail.

23:49.700 --> 23:50.900
You can't forget
the details.

23:50.967 --> 23:52.300
The details are of
the utmost importance.

23:52.367 --> 23:53.200
Copy that.

23:53.267 --> 23:54.533
Utmost.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.567
Uh, Todd, Todd?

23:55.633 --> 23:56.833
The table.

23:56.900 --> 23:57.933
I just need you
to help me flip it over.

23:58.067 --> 23:59.067
-Right.
-Yeah.

23:59.133 --> 24:01.300
Never
do that twirl thing again.

24:01.367 --> 24:02.333
It was an impulse thing.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.333
It was...
Yeah, kind of weird.

24:03.400 --> 24:04.967
You know what?

24:05.067 --> 24:05.900
Hold the phone.

24:05.967 --> 24:08.967
We do not do manual labor.

24:10.067 --> 24:11.067
Kids!

24:11.100 --> 24:14.233
Cooper house, stat!

24:14.300 --> 24:15.900
May I say

24:15.967 --> 24:17.733
one of the few perks

24:17.800 --> 24:19.100
of having two kids
under the age of 15

24:19.167 --> 24:22.133
is that I never have
to lift a finger again.

24:25.900 --> 24:28.100
Okay, dudes,
your mission is as follows.

24:28.167 --> 24:29.133
Grab the table,
turn it over,

24:29.200 --> 24:30.400
take it to the garage.

24:30.467 --> 24:32.700
Cooper's Angels
are lemonade-ing it.

24:34.333 --> 24:35.300
You know what?
Let's do this right.

24:35.367 --> 24:36.767
Go the extra mile.

24:36.833 --> 24:38.100
Grab a tablecloth
and throw it on there,

24:38.167 --> 24:39.200
maybe some flowers too.

24:39.267 --> 24:40.200
You can pick them
from our lawn,

24:40.267 --> 24:42.600
but do not tell your mother.

24:42.667 --> 24:43.933
Go!

24:52.733 --> 24:54.900
They're good kids.

24:54.967 --> 24:56.067
I don't understand.

24:56.067 --> 24:57.767
How do you get them
to do things?

24:57.833 --> 24:59.367
Elisa is the only one
that actually does anything.

24:59.433 --> 25:00.733
The other two,
forget about it.

25:00.800 --> 25:02.133
Uh, it's a monetary thing.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.100
I pay them...

25:03.167 --> 25:04.533
under the table,

25:04.600 --> 25:06.300
and there is nothing wrong
with child labor,

25:06.367 --> 25:07.400
nothing wrong at all.

25:08.767 --> 25:09.800
Please don't tell Maggie.

25:09.867 --> 25:12.133
Todd! Todd!

25:12.200 --> 25:13.367
They're picking
my flowers!

25:13.433 --> 25:15.267
King of the world,
my friend.

25:15.333 --> 25:16.533
Did you tell
them they could do that?

25:16.600 --> 25:18.900
-Todd! Todd!
-King of the world.

25:18.967 --> 25:19.833
Todd,
where are you?

25:19.900 --> 25:20.733
Coming!

25:30.367 --> 25:31.800
So, uh, Gigi,

25:31.867 --> 25:34.133
are you taking
recorder this year?

25:34.200 --> 25:35.167
Violin.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.200
Wow, you're so athletic.

25:41.267 --> 25:44.133
That's the best you got?

25:45.067 --> 25:47.800
Apparently, she knows
what to do with boys.

25:47.867 --> 25:50.067
What doesn't
she know?

25:50.133 --> 25:53.067
Mom would be
so proud of her.

25:56.200 --> 25:59.067
She would have been
very proud of you too.

25:59.133 --> 26:00.867
You're so caring
and nice.

26:00.933 --> 26:02.433
You take care of us.

26:02.500 --> 26:04.233
What?

26:04.300 --> 26:06.600
You think
I don't notice?

26:06.667 --> 26:09.067
All right,
let's do this thing.

26:15.600 --> 26:18.467
You guys are going
to get into so much trouble.

26:28.567 --> 26:30.233
Oh, how was your nap?

26:30.300 --> 26:31.267
I had a nightmare
you moved out.

26:31.333 --> 26:32.300
All packed.

26:32.367 --> 26:33.067
Moving mañana .

26:33.133 --> 26:34.333
Tomorrow?

26:34.400 --> 26:36.133
Now you understand
my language.

26:39.067 --> 26:40.133
Okay, okay.

26:40.200 --> 26:41.100
How much do you want?

26:41.167 --> 26:42.067
Name your price.

26:42.133 --> 26:43.333
I'll take three grand, hmm?

26:43.400 --> 26:45.400
Okay.

26:49.067 --> 26:50.200
Gracias.

26:51.333 --> 26:52.900
Oh, still moving,

26:52.967 --> 26:54.333
but this should cover
the hardwood floors.

26:57.600 --> 26:58.967
What the heck
is that?

27:19.600 --> 27:20.900
Yeah.

27:26.167 --> 27:27.600
There he is!

27:41.100 --> 27:42.467
Girls, what's going on?

27:42.533 --> 27:43.500
We told you.

27:43.567 --> 27:45.067
Lemonade stand.

27:45.100 --> 27:46.400
There's a lot of people here,

27:46.467 --> 27:49.667
and they're all...
women people.

27:49.733 --> 27:51.433
It seems we've made
some very good lemonade.

27:51.500 --> 27:52.467
Yeah.

27:52.533 --> 27:55.067
Like, the best lemonade ever.

27:55.133 --> 27:56.267
I'm going to ask you
one more time,

27:56.333 --> 27:57.600
and then I'm going
to get mad.

27:57.667 --> 28:04.067
What is going on,
Mirabel, Elisa, Georgina?

28:04.100 --> 28:06.067
It's safe to surmise,

28:06.133 --> 28:09.333
given the age range
of these lovely ladies,

28:09.400 --> 28:11.067
they remember you
from your pro-ball days.

28:11.100 --> 28:12.567
Do I need to list
my occupation

28:12.633 --> 28:13.633
as well as my hobbies?

28:13.700 --> 28:15.300
-Ugh.

28:25.133 --> 28:26.500
Sir, you realize
it's illegal

28:26.567 --> 28:28.067
to operate a business
in a residential area

28:28.067 --> 28:29.333
without
the proper permits?

28:29.400 --> 28:31.600
Oh, uh, no disrespect
whatsoever, officer,

28:31.667 --> 28:35.467
but this is a children's
lemonade stand for charity.

28:35.533 --> 28:37.067
This is a dating service.

28:37.067 --> 28:38.567
Yeah... A what?

28:38.633 --> 28:40.067
There was an email posted
on the community Web site

28:40.133 --> 28:41.267
and there are signs
throughout the county.

28:41.333 --> 28:42.533
The-- The county?

28:42.600 --> 28:43.567
Mm-hmm.

28:43.633 --> 28:45.767
A dating service?

28:45.833 --> 28:47.467
I don't know what
you're talking about,

28:47.533 --> 28:48.533
officer.

28:48.600 --> 28:50.300
You really
don't know, do you?

28:53.967 --> 28:56.367
Poor guy.

28:56.433 --> 28:58.067
I suggest you look
behind you, pal.

29:06.800 --> 29:09.067
I am terribly sorry, officer.

29:09.067 --> 29:11.200
It's over right now.

29:16.500 --> 29:17.533
Ha ha.

29:21.067 --> 29:22.400
Inside.

29:22.467 --> 29:24.267
But we're making a book
with all their pictures.

29:24.333 --> 29:26.067
Now!

29:33.467 --> 29:34.367
I'm Annie.

29:34.433 --> 29:35.500
My number's right here.

29:35.567 --> 29:37.633
Wednesday and Thursdays
are best.

29:51.400 --> 29:52.700
Hello, ladies.

29:52.767 --> 29:53.667
Todd!

29:53.733 --> 29:54.667
Coming!

30:02.300 --> 30:03.200
May I just say...

30:03.267 --> 30:04.767
No.

30:04.833 --> 30:07.667
What you girls did up there
was truly unacceptable,

30:07.733 --> 30:09.133
humiliating,

30:09.200 --> 30:10.433
and, more importantly,
you lied to me.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.433
We didn't mean--

30:11.500 --> 30:12.700
No.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.033
You cannot
make up your minds

30:14.100 --> 30:15.300
that something
is going to be,

30:15.367 --> 30:16.600
and then just do it.

30:16.667 --> 30:18.233
But isn't that
the definition

30:18.300 --> 30:20.167
of tenacity
and ambition?

30:20.233 --> 30:22.433
Aren't these characteristics
you encourage?

30:24.700 --> 30:26.067
That is not the point.

30:26.133 --> 30:28.000
No, you did
what you did

30:28.067 --> 30:29.200
without any regard for me,

30:29.267 --> 30:32.333
and that is very, very wrong.

30:32.400 --> 30:36.033
It was for you, Papi,
so you can have a life.

30:37.667 --> 30:38.600
I didn't mean...

30:38.667 --> 30:41.700
I have a life,

30:41.767 --> 30:43.333
with the three of you
and Abuela.

30:43.400 --> 30:45.133
That's my life,

30:45.200 --> 30:47.500
and it's a life
that I love and I cherish.

30:47.567 --> 30:49.167
It's not
enough.

30:52.233 --> 30:54.767
You three don't get to decide

30:54.833 --> 30:57.567
what is enough for me
and what is not.

30:57.633 --> 30:59.233
You're children!

30:59.300 --> 31:00.733
My children.

31:00.800 --> 31:04.067
You need
to go upstairs now.

31:24.100 --> 31:26.067
It's too much on my own,
Isabella.

31:26.100 --> 31:28.667
I think that's why I'm here.

31:28.733 --> 31:32.133
It's to help you
move on

31:32.200 --> 31:34.200
so you don't have
to do it alone,

31:34.267 --> 31:40.200
so that you're ready
to be with someone else,

31:40.267 --> 31:43.600
so that you can have
someone to love.

31:47.600 --> 31:49.300
Uh-oh...

31:49.367 --> 31:52.100
the girls are
very upset, hijo.

31:55.867 --> 31:57.667
Rosa, you saw what they did.

31:57.733 --> 32:00.267
They did it
because they love you,

32:00.333 --> 32:02.867
and you weren't going
to do it on your own.

32:02.933 --> 32:05.500
Don't you think I would be
the first one to tell you

32:05.567 --> 32:07.100
if the timing
wasn't right?

32:07.167 --> 32:08.967
She was my daughter,

32:09.067 --> 32:12.267
and she will always
be a part of this family,

32:12.333 --> 32:16.267
and she is here with us,
every day.

32:16.333 --> 32:18.467
Oh, you have no idea.

32:18.533 --> 32:21.433
Isabella was kind,
generous, and giving.

32:21.500 --> 32:25.133
She would want you
to move on now.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.333
It's time.

32:28.300 --> 32:31.400
How long are you going
to keep them up there?

32:31.467 --> 32:33.233
Just give me a few minutes
to calm down,

32:33.300 --> 32:34.600
because right now,

32:34.667 --> 32:36.300
I could sell them on eBay.

32:37.633 --> 32:38.733
I'll go get them.

32:42.633 --> 32:43.867
Oh, hey!

32:43.933 --> 32:45.767
You can't keep
doing that!

32:45.833 --> 32:47.367
You know,
popping in and out.

32:47.433 --> 32:48.500
It's not up to me.

32:48.567 --> 32:49.667
You needed me.

32:49.733 --> 32:50.700
I'm here.

32:50.767 --> 32:51.667
Ish.

32:51.733 --> 32:54.533
You're here ish.

32:54.600 --> 32:56.733
Daddy?

33:01.867 --> 33:03.367
Get down here.

33:11.867 --> 33:13.467
Have you read
any Mark Twain?

33:13.533 --> 33:14.833
You know, I never know
what you're going to say,

33:14.900 --> 33:16.267
and it kills me.

33:16.333 --> 33:17.500
This morning it was dolls,

33:17.567 --> 33:18.700
and now
it's American literature.

33:18.767 --> 33:19.733
What can I say?

33:19.800 --> 33:21.333
I'm an enigma.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.433
So have you read Twain
or not, Daddy?

33:23.500 --> 33:25.600
Yeah, a bit.

33:25.667 --> 33:26.967
Well, it's my feeling

33:27.067 --> 33:28.767
that it's fear
that holds us back,

33:28.833 --> 33:30.167
across the board.

33:30.233 --> 33:32.600
Are you sure you're eight?

33:32.667 --> 33:34.200
Oh, Daddy.
Yes, I'm eight!

33:35.200 --> 33:35.933
The thing is

33:36.067 --> 33:38.367
Twain wrote,

33:38.433 --> 33:40.067
"20 years from now,

33:40.100 --> 33:42.067
"you will be more disappointed
by the things you didn't do

33:42.133 --> 33:43.900
"than by the things
you did do,

33:43.967 --> 33:45.967
"so throw off
your bowlines,

33:46.067 --> 33:47.767
"sail away
from the safe harbor,

33:47.833 --> 33:50.400
and catch trade winds
in your sails."

33:58.333 --> 33:59.467
Wow.

33:59.533 --> 34:02.067
That was, uh,
that was something.

34:02.100 --> 34:05.433
Essentially, Twain is saying
to leave safety behind

34:05.500 --> 34:07.900
and to go forge
into the unknown.

34:07.967 --> 34:09.367
Women, Dad--

34:09.433 --> 34:11.667
new experiences
are the unknown.

34:11.733 --> 34:12.933
It's time to forge.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.767
You got your mother's brain,
Gigi.

34:18.833 --> 34:22.733
No doubt about that.

34:27.467 --> 34:28.667
Fiesta time!

34:44.533 --> 34:45.700
But it was a success!

34:45.767 --> 34:47.300
We have sheets of names
and numbers.

34:47.367 --> 34:48.767
I'm sorry
I missed it.

34:48.833 --> 34:50.467
Wait a minute.
How many women were there?

34:50.533 --> 34:51.733
A lot.

34:51.800 --> 34:54.467
Some of them
were really cute.

34:54.533 --> 34:55.767
Well, I mean,
for older women.

34:55.833 --> 34:56.700
Older women?

34:56.767 --> 34:57.967
Yeah, like in their 30s.

34:58.067 --> 35:00.433
Oh, yeah, that's very old.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.700
I've got
to tell you,

35:01.767 --> 35:02.933
when my girls put
their mind to something,

35:03.067 --> 35:04.833
they do it.

35:04.900 --> 35:05.800
It was quite
the scene,

35:05.867 --> 35:07.067
but, you know,

35:07.067 --> 35:08.733
not the way
I want to go about it.

35:08.800 --> 35:11.767
How are we going
to go about it?

35:11.833 --> 35:13.467
You know, we could go

35:13.533 --> 35:17.133
with the former baseball pro/
business owner angle.

35:17.200 --> 35:18.500
Or the single dad.

35:18.567 --> 35:19.533
That always works.

35:19.600 --> 35:21.433
No, "we" are not
doing anything,

35:21.500 --> 35:23.900
and "we" are not
working any angles.

35:23.967 --> 35:24.933
Okay.

35:25.067 --> 35:26.733
Go online, like me.

35:28.800 --> 35:29.967
What?

35:30.067 --> 35:31.733
I'm not dead yet.

35:31.800 --> 35:33.433
Where do you think I do
every Friday night?

35:33.500 --> 35:35.067
Bingo? Please.

35:35.100 --> 35:36.833
Abuela, you lied to us.

35:36.900 --> 35:38.400
It happens. Get over it.

35:48.733 --> 35:49.867
Hey.

35:49.933 --> 35:50.800
Hi.

35:50.867 --> 35:52.733
You care to join me?

35:52.800 --> 35:54.367
Sure. What are you
drinking?

35:54.433 --> 35:55.533
I don't care.

35:55.600 --> 35:56.867
Oh, then make mine
a double.

35:56.933 --> 35:57.833
Okay.

36:02.567 --> 36:04.100
Remember that party in Cabo

36:04.167 --> 36:06.600
when Isabella ate--

36:06.667 --> 36:09.567
Yeah. The squid nachos
with the cheesy spray stuff.

36:09.633 --> 36:10.467
Yeah.

36:10.533 --> 36:11.733
Mm-hmm.

36:13.700 --> 36:14.800
I miss her.

36:14.867 --> 36:16.067
You were best friends.

36:16.100 --> 36:18.100
Yeah.

36:19.867 --> 36:21.333
To Isabella.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.067
To Isabella.

36:26.833 --> 36:28.100
What are you
looking for?

36:28.167 --> 36:31.400
Huh? Oh... nothing.

36:32.433 --> 36:34.767
What's going on with you?

36:34.833 --> 36:37.400
I can't even begin
to explain.

36:37.467 --> 36:39.600
Celebrations are tough.

36:42.767 --> 36:44.233
Jackie, I love you,

36:44.300 --> 36:46.133
you're my sister-in-law
and a great doctor,

36:46.200 --> 36:47.800
but aneurysms
don't work that way.

36:47.867 --> 36:50.433
There was nothing
you could do.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.467
I know, I know.

36:52.533 --> 36:54.067
I didn't say anything.

36:54.133 --> 36:55.400
Not a word. Nothing.

36:55.467 --> 36:57.333
No. You didn't need to.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.533
Drink up.

37:02.567 --> 37:03.933
You know,
it's been a tough day,

37:04.067 --> 37:05.967
but this cocktail
is really working for me.

37:13.067 --> 37:15.400
Oh, oh, oh!

37:15.467 --> 37:17.900
Oh!

37:17.967 --> 37:19.500
Your age
is showing, Daddy.

37:19.567 --> 37:20.833
Oh, give me a break,
little girl.

37:20.900 --> 37:21.967
Aah!

37:22.067 --> 37:24.167
I am so wiping
the floor with you.

37:24.233 --> 37:25.533
Oh, settle down there.

37:25.600 --> 37:26.800
I am so... Oh, no, no!

37:26.867 --> 37:29.067
No, no, no! Crap.

37:29.067 --> 37:30.500
I'm going in
for the kill,

37:30.567 --> 37:31.567
and there I am,

37:31.633 --> 37:33.067
bounding
over tall buildings

37:33.133 --> 37:35.967
and, oh, a nice rooftop flip,
if I do say so myself.

37:38.800 --> 37:40.067
I don't want you
to grow up.

37:41.733 --> 37:43.433
I'm sorry.

37:43.500 --> 37:44.433
That's not fair.

37:44.500 --> 37:45.800
I know you have to grow up,

37:45.867 --> 37:47.067
and I know I'm lame

37:47.133 --> 37:48.567
for wanting you to be
a little girl.

37:48.633 --> 37:50.067
I get it.
Little kids are cute.

37:50.067 --> 37:53.433
You were so cute!

37:53.500 --> 37:54.133
We got Gigi.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.533
She's super cute.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.600
The cutest...

37:56.667 --> 37:58.133
besides you
and Mirabel.

38:01.367 --> 38:04.567
Are you too old to cuddle?

38:04.633 --> 38:06.267
Nope.

38:09.900 --> 38:11.467
Do you remember
what I asked you

38:11.533 --> 38:13.100
on your 8th birthday?

38:13.167 --> 38:14.967
You asked me if I'd promise
to always hold your hand

38:15.067 --> 38:16.467
when I crossed the street.

38:16.533 --> 38:17.767
And you said yes.

38:17.833 --> 38:19.567
I meant it, Daddy.

38:19.633 --> 38:21.667
I love you...

38:23.100 --> 38:24.433
But I will end you
in a New York minute!

38:39.900 --> 38:42.667
Oh, honey, come here.

38:42.733 --> 38:44.067
Come here.

38:52.867 --> 38:58.067
I miss her so much,

38:58.100 --> 38:59.900
and she would always
wear these.

39:00.067 --> 39:01.933
I'm sorry, Papi.

39:02.067 --> 39:03.333
I'll put them back.

39:04.700 --> 39:06.667
Do you try
them on a lot?

39:15.933 --> 39:17.600
They're yours.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.067
Thank you, Papi.

39:28.133 --> 39:30.300
I'll treasure them forever.

39:33.733 --> 39:36.100
You have your mother's
beauty, Mirabel,

39:36.167 --> 39:39.767
and that's
no small thing,

39:39.833 --> 39:45.067
but, more importantly,
you have her heart...

39:45.067 --> 39:46.900
and mine.

40:26.233 --> 40:27.233
What's going on here?

40:27.300 --> 40:29.000
Sleepover.

40:29.067 --> 40:30.300
Is that a piece of cake?

40:30.367 --> 40:32.033
Ooh, can we see that?

40:32.100 --> 40:33.200
Hand it over,
old man.

40:35.867 --> 40:37.800
You girls can
fall asleep here.

40:37.867 --> 40:39.833
I'll transfer you
later.

40:40.867 --> 40:42.767
I can still
pick you all up.

40:42.833 --> 40:44.000
Tricky Ricky's
still got it.

40:44.067 --> 40:47.167
I'm still really strong,
like, seriously strong.

40:48.600 --> 40:50.000
And it's gone!

40:50.067 --> 40:51.100
Over the wall!

40:51.167 --> 40:52.967
The crowd goes wild!

40:53.033 --> 40:55.667
Tricky Ricky
has done it again.

40:57.600 --> 40:59.767
Huh? That's it?

40:59.833 --> 41:01.633
Come on, what--
Check out these guns.

41:01.700 --> 41:03.167
Look at that.

41:03.233 --> 41:04.733
Like Popeye.

41:04.800 --> 41:05.967
That appeals
to women.

41:06.067 --> 41:07.167
It's a visceral
thing.

41:07.233 --> 41:09.600
I don't even know
what that means.

41:09.667 --> 41:11.133
The males of many species

41:11.200 --> 41:12.733
like to show off
for the female

41:12.800 --> 41:13.833
in order
to attract them,

41:13.900 --> 41:15.267
like the peacock,

41:15.333 --> 41:17.200
or the elusive blue-footed booby
in The Galápagos,

41:17.267 --> 41:18.233
for instance...

41:19.667 --> 41:21.733
National Geographic ?
Hello?

41:21.800 --> 41:23.267
That's it.

41:24.133 --> 41:25.133
Out, out.

41:25.200 --> 41:26.967
Okay, hey, hey,
enough, ladies.

41:27.067 --> 41:28.667
No more fighting,

41:28.733 --> 41:30.133
no more lemonade stands,

41:30.200 --> 41:32.667
no more sweaters
for the people in Sudan.

41:32.733 --> 41:34.167
No more.

41:34.233 --> 41:36.333
That's my birthday wish.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.233
Now, move over.

41:37.300 --> 41:38.167
Move!

41:41.200 --> 41:42.867
Ahh... Happy Birthday to me!

41:47.767 --> 41:50.067
You're going to be okay.

41:51.233 --> 41:54.833
I'm going to be okay.
