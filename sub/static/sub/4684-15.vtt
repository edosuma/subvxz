WEBVTT

00:01.566 --> 00:04.900
No, no, no.
Don't touch that dial.

00:04.966 --> 00:07.900
Here's what's on my mind
tonight.

00:10.066 --> 00:12.100
Johnny and his pals

00:10.066 --> 00:12.100
hired a guide

00:12.166 --> 00:13.466
to take them hunting.

00:13.533 --> 00:14.800
So where is this dweeb?

00:14.866 --> 00:16.666
Come on. We're a little early,
he'll be here.

00:16.733 --> 00:20.366
Now they all want a shot
at a different kind of game.

00:20.433 --> 00:22.566
If you're gonna sleep with me,
you better get going.

00:22.633 --> 00:24.633
I believe, we've died
and gone to Playboy heaven.

00:24.700 --> 00:27.700
But have the hunters,
become the hunted?

00:27.766 --> 00:30.200
Tony Dow.
Sandahl Bergman.

00:30.266 --> 00:32.600
Don't try to run, Johnny.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.733
"Freddy's Nightmares."

00:55.266 --> 00:59.566
You're in Springwood now,
and you're all mine.

01:53.300 --> 01:54.866
'Are you okay?'

01:54.933 --> 01:56.466
Don't point that thing at me.

01:56.533 --> 01:59.366
Sorry, I-I don't know,
how to handle these things.

01:59.433 --> 02:01.733
Having another
Vietnam flashback.

02:01.800 --> 02:03.600
You know, they got veteran
programs to deal with that--

02:03.666 --> 02:06.466
Jake, I was never in Nam.

02:06.533 --> 02:07.933
'How long you've been
having these fantasies?'

02:08.000 --> 02:09.733
I don't know,
a couple of weeks.

02:09.800 --> 02:12.000
You know, they say that,
you substitute a fantasy

02:12.066 --> 02:13.933
if reality is too horrible.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.700
Yeah, well, that'll be
my first marriage.

02:17.700 --> 02:20.433
Or maybe it's this trip,
I didn't feel like making it.

02:20.500 --> 02:22.166
Yeah, well,
this is all Todd's big idea.

02:22.233 --> 02:25.300
I mean,
what do we listen to him for?

02:25.366 --> 02:26.833
'Cause he's Todd.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.700
There's nothing out there.

02:29.766 --> 02:31.266
No one.

02:31.333 --> 02:32.933
So, where is this dweeb?

02:33.000 --> 02:35.133
Come on, we're a little early.
He'll be here.

02:35.200 --> 02:36.900
I'm sure the guide knows,
where he's going.

02:36.966 --> 02:39.433
What if we are on
the wrong trail or something?

02:40.200 --> 02:41.700
I know how to read a map.

02:43.033 --> 02:45.233
This is the trail
and we're on it.

02:46.466 --> 02:48.200
So, where the hell
is Timberlin Point?

02:50.033 --> 02:51.700
'You're standing on it.'

02:53.533 --> 02:56.166
If you're gonna sleep with me,
you better get going.

02:56.233 --> 03:00.066
Hey...I believe, we've died
and gone to the Playboy heaven.

03:00.133 --> 03:02.833
Wish the wife were here
to see this. She'd kill him.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.000
Johnny, Jake, Todd.

03:12.066 --> 03:15.333
I can kill 'em all
and still stay under my limit.

03:16.200 --> 03:17.633
Good thing too.

03:17.700 --> 03:20.200
I wouldn't wanna loose
my hunting license.

03:30.133 --> 03:31.733
We'll set up camp here.

03:31.800 --> 03:32.866
Looks good to me.

03:32.933 --> 03:34.433
I'll make the arrangements

03:36.300 --> 03:38.600
We'll all sleep together, right?

03:38.666 --> 03:40.200
There's only one tent.

03:42.466 --> 03:43.966
Hey, uh..

03:44.033 --> 03:46.333
How did you get
the name "Tracker" anyway?

03:46.400 --> 03:48.833
My brother was a green beret
at Fort Bragg.

03:48.900 --> 03:50.333
I used to track down
his enemy units

03:50.400 --> 03:52.533
during war game maneuvers.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.066
It's easy to find men.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.300
Oh, yeah?
And then what?

03:58.300 --> 04:01.166
And then, most can't handle it.

04:04.300 --> 04:06.800
- I'll help..
- Did you tie that knot?

04:11.100 --> 04:14.600
Guys, the tent's
not a three man job.

04:14.666 --> 04:17.866
Todd, why don't you and Jake
go dig a pit for a fire?

04:17.933 --> 04:20.333
I'd rather work
with you on the tent.

04:20.400 --> 04:24.633
I know, why don't you dig a pit
and light your fire over there?

04:24.700 --> 04:26.566
That way the forest
won't burn down.

04:26.633 --> 04:30.100
'Come on, old man. You were,
uh, cub scout, weren't you?

04:31.400 --> 04:34.033
- Boy scout.
- 'Ooh, boy scout.'

04:38.233 --> 04:40.366
- Sorry about Todd.
- 'Oh, it's alright.'

04:40.433 --> 04:41.533
'I'm used to it.'

04:47.633 --> 04:50.300
- What's the matter?
- The stakes.

04:50.366 --> 04:52.700
- Tent stakes?
- 'Put them away.'

04:53.966 --> 04:55.100
Okay.

04:56.400 --> 04:57.866
'What's wrong anyway?'

04:57.933 --> 04:59.866
I'm sorry.

04:59.933 --> 05:03.500
I had a husband and he
was killed in an accident.

05:03.566 --> 05:05.733
'A wooden stake,
went right through his heart.'

05:05.800 --> 05:08.200
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

05:13.366 --> 05:16.033
Hey, looks like Johnny's
making time, huh?

05:21.733 --> 05:23.000
Take a look at that.

05:23.066 --> 05:26.000
Oh, what am I gonna do, huh?

05:26.066 --> 05:28.366
Looks like
you're gonna die, kid.

05:28.433 --> 05:30.066
- What?
- Yeah.

05:30.133 --> 05:32.100
In about 40 or 50 years.

05:33.633 --> 05:35.633
- Nice gash.
- Here's some antiseptic.

05:35.700 --> 05:36.666
'I don't need it.'

05:36.733 --> 05:38.433
Best thing for a wound
is saliva.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.300
Ah!

05:56.733 --> 05:59.233
Why do you think she wanted
to sleep in the woods?

05:59.300 --> 06:01.266
After what she did today.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.433
I don't think we'd get
too much sleep

06:02.500 --> 06:04.100
if she was in here right now.

06:04.166 --> 06:06.533
Yeah, could you believe
that hand action?

06:06.600 --> 06:09.733
Yeah, heh, I'm gonna
cut my thigh tomorrow.

06:09.800 --> 06:11.966
No. Well, that's just
what she wants.

06:12.033 --> 06:15.466
Yeah. If that's just
what she wants she can have it.

06:15.533 --> 06:18.300
Man, you don't get
women at all.

06:18.366 --> 06:20.466
You gotta make them beg for it.

06:20.533 --> 06:22.100
Make them think
you don't care.

06:23.900 --> 06:26.233
So tomorrow, we hunt.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.866
I'm gonna bring down a big buck.

06:28.933 --> 06:30.533
Yeah.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.833
And then later, much later
Tracker.

06:35.066 --> 06:36.733
Make 'em wait, guys.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.900
Make 'em wait.

06:38.966 --> 06:43.466
You know, I, uh, I never felt
anything like that before.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.800
My wife usually hands me
a Band-Aid.

06:47.900 --> 06:49.333
Goodnight, Johnny.

06:50.933 --> 06:53.200
- Huh?
- Goodnight.

06:54.233 --> 06:56.033
Yeah, goodnight.

06:59.833 --> 07:01.600
What the hell was that?

07:01.666 --> 07:05.900
Get a grip, will ya?
It's just some bats.

07:05.966 --> 07:07.133
Bats.

07:16.366 --> 07:17.800
How'd you sleep?

07:17.866 --> 07:19.333
Alright.

07:20.533 --> 07:22.466
There're always
bats up here?

07:22.533 --> 07:24.733
No, just this time
of the year.

07:24.800 --> 07:25.800
And this is the time
of the year

07:25.866 --> 07:27.933
that you always come up
here to guide, huh?

07:28.000 --> 07:29.200
Yeah.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.800
Is something bothering you?

07:32.866 --> 07:34.833
Must be in the mountain air.

07:37.466 --> 07:39.600
'But then
I've never seen anybody'

07:39.666 --> 07:41.633
'clean a wound quiet like that.'

07:41.700 --> 07:43.533
Sucking the blood right up.

07:45.066 --> 07:48.333
You know with the stakes
and the bats last night

07:48.400 --> 07:49.966
and you slept outside.

07:50.033 --> 07:51.933
One thought
led to another and..

07:54.666 --> 07:56.400
Um..

07:56.466 --> 07:59.733
Uh, nothing. Never mind.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.433
- I, uh, I gotta get my plate.
- I'll get you some food.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.133
Yeah, thanks.

08:22.366 --> 08:25.900
Bet you'll like
my special sauce.

08:27.066 --> 08:28.700
'Eat hearty.'

08:28.766 --> 08:31.500
Uh, no thanks.
uh, I think I'll pass.

08:31.566 --> 08:32.833
Don't you understand?

08:32.900 --> 08:35.600
You have to eat, otherwise
you'll never survive out here.

08:35.666 --> 08:37.633
Yeah, I don't care.
I'm not eating that stuff.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.833
Boys!

08:40.900 --> 08:42.833
Hey, wait,
what're you guys doing?

09:07.800 --> 09:10.533
Jesus, you scared me.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.266
Sorry, I heard footsteps.

09:13.333 --> 09:15.733
- You got good ears.
- Like sonar.

09:17.333 --> 09:20.266
Something has been
bothering you. What is it?

09:20.333 --> 09:24.366
Uh, it's, it's nothing
it's really stupid.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.400
I, uh, I feel better now.

09:27.333 --> 09:28.633
That's good.

09:36.966 --> 09:38.733
Get some rest.

09:54.333 --> 09:56.133
So I, uh, finally got her up

09:56.200 --> 09:58.133
to my father's mountain cabin,
right?

09:58.200 --> 09:59.566
'And we waited till dark'

09:59.633 --> 10:01.433
'And my two buddies
climbed up on the roof.'

10:01.500 --> 10:02.966
Right. This is planned.

10:03.033 --> 10:06.366
I can't believe we did this.

10:06.433 --> 10:08.400
'We used the garden hose
for the rain.'

10:08.466 --> 10:12.200
'And then we used,
a metal sheet for the thunder.'

10:12.266 --> 10:14.233
'Well, it worked.
She got scared.'

10:14.300 --> 10:17.366
'And then, just as I got
her into the sack'

10:17.433 --> 10:19.700
'it actually
started to rain.'

10:19.766 --> 10:22.066
Both guys fell off the roof

10:22.133 --> 10:24.233
we had to rush them
to the hospital.

10:24.300 --> 10:27.566
'Which is where
they repaired my broken nose.'

10:27.633 --> 10:30.666
Because she punched
me straight in the face.

10:38.833 --> 10:39.966
You want some oatmeal?

10:40.033 --> 10:41.600
'I made it myself.'

10:44.333 --> 10:45.433
What's your rush?

10:45.500 --> 10:47.666
You're waiting for
a candle light dinner?

10:47.733 --> 10:49.600
I need a favor first.

10:50.533 --> 10:51.800
Sure.

11:02.300 --> 11:05.333
Todd, I have super
sensitive skin

11:05.400 --> 11:08.166
and I feel my sunblock
wearing off

11:08.233 --> 11:10.433
could you put
some on for me?

11:10.500 --> 11:12.433
I-I think I can handle that.

11:12.500 --> 11:14.400
All over me.

11:22.100 --> 11:25.300
- 'Strange name.'
- It's privately made.

11:25.366 --> 11:28.500
It has 350 times protection
from the sun.

11:30.000 --> 11:32.266
I never knew,
they went that high.

11:32.333 --> 11:34.533
You find anything strange
about Tracker?

11:35.933 --> 11:37.966
Yeah, she-she bothers me.

11:38.033 --> 11:40.000
Yeah, me too.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.433
She is so sexy.
It hurts. Huh?

11:42.500 --> 11:45.400
I mean, when I look at her
my body actually aches.

11:46.733 --> 11:48.633
My mind kind of fogs up.

11:52.166 --> 11:53.733
Like my oatmeal?

11:57.300 --> 11:58.400
No.

12:01.900 --> 12:03.633
It's time.

12:03.700 --> 12:06.100
You bet it is.

12:06.166 --> 12:07.800
Gotta hit the trail
or if you're gonna bag

12:07.866 --> 12:09.800
that big buck tomorrow.

12:20.500 --> 12:23.333
It's painful.
It's really painful.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.433
Stay!

12:41.700 --> 12:43.633
Do you believe him?

12:43.700 --> 12:46.333
He falls down,
the rifle goes off.

12:46.400 --> 12:47.866
And he kills a rabbit.

12:47.933 --> 12:51.100
I suggest, we hit the sack.
We got a big tomorrow.

12:51.166 --> 12:53.400
'And a whole night ahead of us.'

12:53.466 --> 12:55.000
'Pick up were we left off?'

12:57.000 --> 12:59.266
Do you have something
you could bring with you.

12:59.333 --> 13:01.600
You can't be
too careful these days.

13:01.666 --> 13:03.066
Oh, you got it.

13:03.133 --> 13:04.533
Be right back.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.133
What the hell's going on?

13:22.200 --> 13:23.633
Beats me.

13:23.700 --> 13:26.466
She just grabbed his hand and
off they went into the woods.

13:26.533 --> 13:28.366
She set me up.

13:28.433 --> 13:30.033
She used me.

13:30.966 --> 13:32.266
They're all the same.

13:32.333 --> 13:35.200
They go out with one guy just
to make another guy jealous.

13:35.266 --> 13:36.766
You're telling me
that all the women in the world

13:36.833 --> 13:39.066
are going with one guy just
to make another guy jealous?

13:39.133 --> 13:41.100
That's exactly what I mean.

14:02.733 --> 14:04.533
Please!

14:04.600 --> 14:05.533
No more.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.200
Stop, you're gonna kill me.

14:11.266 --> 14:13.333
'Please, no more.'

14:30.933 --> 14:32.233
Wait, Johnny, it's only me

14:32.300 --> 14:33.600
- What is it?
- Jake's gone.

14:33.666 --> 14:35.900
I don't know, where he is.
Come on, we gotta find him

14:38.366 --> 14:39.766
What's going on?

14:39.833 --> 14:41.233
Jake's missing.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.133
- Anything?
- No!

14:50.000 --> 14:52.833
God, doesn't look
like she's any luck either

14:52.900 --> 14:54.966
She probably got naked
and bonked him to death

14:55.033 --> 14:56.633
and buried him
under some leaves.

14:56.700 --> 14:58.400
It's like he just vanished.

14:58.466 --> 14:59.566
Hey, look, I thought
you were supposed to know

14:59.633 --> 15:00.633
every inch of this place.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.566
Easy, Johnny,
it's not her fault.

15:02.633 --> 15:03.833
Hey, what did you
do with him, huh?

15:03.900 --> 15:04.933
What's the matter with you?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.500
Keep looking.

15:20.366 --> 15:21.966
Is there something
you're not telling me?

15:22.033 --> 15:23.933
Hmm?

15:24.000 --> 15:25.866
No. Not really.

15:25.933 --> 15:27.566
Don't be an idiot.

15:27.633 --> 15:31.100
Oh, it's, uh,
it's too weird.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.533
What's going on
with you guys?

15:37.566 --> 15:39.600
What do you think
she does out there all night?

15:39.666 --> 15:41.633
I mean, doesn't that bother you?

15:41.700 --> 15:44.500
Her body bothers me, I mean,
going off with Jake bothers me.

15:44.566 --> 15:46.600
But hanging out
in the woods is no big deal.

15:46.666 --> 15:48.600
Yeah, well,
it's not that simple.

15:48.666 --> 15:50.033
The first day we were here.

15:50.100 --> 15:52.766
Tracker was frightened
by these wooden stakes.

15:52.833 --> 15:54.266
And my cross.

15:54.333 --> 15:55.600
Yeah, so?

15:55.666 --> 15:58.300
Yeah, so,
those are things that, uh..

16:00.500 --> 16:03.166
Come on, out with it.

16:03.233 --> 16:05.633
Those are things
that vampires are afraid of.

16:07.366 --> 16:09.666
Well, it's been great talking
to you and keep in touch.

16:09.733 --> 16:10.866
Hey, wait a second,
wait a second.

16:10.933 --> 16:12.866
We heard the bats, right?

16:12.933 --> 16:15.866
I mean, vampires crave
sex and blood and remember

16:15.933 --> 16:18.333
the way she was licking
at Jake's hand?

16:18.400 --> 16:20.600
So, what do you wanna do?
Find her coffin?

16:20.666 --> 16:22.300
I know, it sounds crazy.

16:23.633 --> 16:25.933
But Jake is missing.

16:26.000 --> 16:30.866
Okay, you got the wooden stakes,
the blood, the cross, some bats.

16:30.933 --> 16:32.233
But aren't you forgetting
one thing?

16:32.300 --> 16:34.266
Vampires can't go out
in the sunlight.

16:34.333 --> 16:36.000
And she's out all day.

16:38.066 --> 16:40.333
Jesus.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.400
You're right.
I mean, I never thought of that.

16:42.466 --> 16:44.233
That's stupid.

16:44.300 --> 16:45.600
Yeah, I mean,
s-she couldn't go out

16:45.666 --> 16:47.933
in the sunlight without
some sort of protection.

16:48.000 --> 16:51.033
like a umbrella or,
something like that.

16:53.166 --> 16:56.133
Forget it,
I'm being a jerk.

18:05.133 --> 18:08.233
Don't try to run, Johnny.

18:13.633 --> 18:14.800
Todd?

18:17.500 --> 18:18.700
Todd?

18:35.600 --> 18:36.666
Todd?

18:45.866 --> 18:47.233
Alright,
you blood sucking bitch.

18:47.300 --> 18:48.600
Let's get this over with.

18:48.666 --> 18:51.266
Ah, what a thing to say
to the most exciting creature

18:51.333 --> 18:53.566
that ever entered
into your drab little life

18:53.633 --> 18:54.600
Yeah!

18:56.600 --> 18:58.966
I'm not gonna kill you, Johnny.

18:59.033 --> 19:00.966
I want you.

19:01.033 --> 19:02.833
I need you.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.300
I need an ally.

19:05.366 --> 19:06.800
I promise, you'll love it.

19:06.866 --> 19:08.233
Every minute.

19:08.300 --> 19:11.533
No ecstasy on Earth
could compare to mine.

19:11.600 --> 19:15.900
Your body will shake and quiver
in ways you've never imagined.

19:15.966 --> 19:19.033
What kind of an ally did you
say, you were looking for?

19:19.100 --> 19:21.966
I'm lonely,
Johnny, I need someone.

19:22.033 --> 19:24.166
- You need blood.
- Huh!

19:24.233 --> 19:26.533
You watch too much TV.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.966
I need sex more than blood

19:29.033 --> 19:33.200
I thrive at night
and sex was made for the night.

19:38.700 --> 19:41.200
Can we do without the fangs?

19:41.266 --> 19:43.900
My bite is lust. For life.

19:43.966 --> 19:46.400
So you're looking for
a long term commitment, huh?

19:46.466 --> 19:48.600
Make up your mind.

19:48.666 --> 19:50.733
Love me forever.

19:51.900 --> 19:55.433
- Or die.
- Alright.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.900
Alright,
let's get this romance started.

20:00.133 --> 20:01.800
Drink, Johnny.

20:03.800 --> 20:05.900
Drink his blood.

20:05.966 --> 20:07.566
What?

20:07.633 --> 20:10.000
It's the beginning
of your journey.

20:11.200 --> 20:13.233
There's, uh, no other way?

20:21.866 --> 20:24.600
Guess, I'm an old
fashioned romantic at heart.

20:34.133 --> 20:36.166
Hang in there, buddy,
we'll make it.

20:55.133 --> 20:56.400
Johnny, wake up.

20:56.466 --> 20:58.533
You're having
the nightmares again.

21:00.400 --> 21:03.533
Nightmare?
Oh, thank God, it wasn't real.

21:04.766 --> 21:07.133
Are you alright?

21:07.200 --> 21:09.900
Yeah, just..
Just a little hungry.

21:11.933 --> 21:14.800
Maybe you won't give
me any trouble this time.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.800
What's this doing here?

21:20.866 --> 21:23.400
Don't you remember anything?

21:23.466 --> 21:25.233
Johnny, you can't
keep retreating

21:25.300 --> 21:26.233
into these nightmares.

21:26.300 --> 21:28.533
You've got to face this.

21:28.600 --> 21:30.066
Oh, yeah!

21:30.133 --> 21:32.900
There was a storm
on a business trip and..

21:32.966 --> 21:35.033
There's the storm and you lost
control of the plane.

21:35.100 --> 21:37.100
Yes, it hit my windshield.

21:37.166 --> 21:38.966
We're stuck in ravine.

21:39.033 --> 21:42.133
Oh, I know, I shouldn't
let Todd talk me into this trip.

21:42.200 --> 21:43.233
'Now, eat this.'

21:45.600 --> 21:46.900
You need your strength.

21:46.966 --> 21:49.466
Oh, God.
Now, I remember.

21:49.533 --> 21:51.466
- No, no, I can't--
- Stop fighting this, Johnny.

21:51.533 --> 21:52.833
You've got to face this.

21:52.900 --> 21:55.633
Eat, you'll never
survive unless you eat.

22:04.000 --> 22:07.733
Cannibalism in America
is a serious problem.

22:07.800 --> 22:09.600
A lot of people
are eating human flesh

22:09.666 --> 22:12.033
and they don't know
where it's been.

22:12.100 --> 22:15.033
I want you to join
my campaign to have

22:15.100 --> 22:17.500
all human meat,
government inspected.

22:17.566 --> 22:18.533
Okay?

22:20.933 --> 22:23.833
Hey, don't thank me.

22:23.900 --> 22:26.400
I'm just a public service
kinda guy.

22:52.600 --> 22:53.833
You think anybody
will understand that

22:53.900 --> 22:55.533
we had to do this?

22:56.166 --> 22:58.000
I don't know.

22:58.066 --> 23:01.100
But it's important
that we understand.

23:01.900 --> 23:04.133
It's not like we killed them.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.133
They died in the crash.

23:07.600 --> 23:10.900
Johnny, if there would have been
rabbits or-or-or even mice here

23:10.966 --> 23:12.433
you know, we would
have eaten them instead.

23:12.500 --> 23:15.666
I mean we exhausted
the natural food supply.

23:15.733 --> 23:17.800
There's no way
out of this canyon.

23:20.000 --> 23:23.766
My fiancee Mary Beth and I are
close friends with their wives.

23:23.833 --> 23:25.833
What can I possibly say to them?

23:28.733 --> 23:30.800
That they were good men..

23:31.800 --> 23:33.533
...till the very end.

23:35.733 --> 23:37.900
There will be accusations

23:37.966 --> 23:39.500
when we get out of here.

23:40.700 --> 23:43.300
We're gonna have to
stand by each other.

23:46.733 --> 23:49.200
Hey, down there. Are you okay?

23:52.233 --> 23:53.333
Oh!

24:00.000 --> 24:01.900
Well, thank God you've come.

24:01.966 --> 24:03.633
I couldn't bear it any longer.

24:03.700 --> 24:05.933
Keep me away from him.
He's eaten his friends.

24:06.000 --> 24:08.000
He likes it.

24:08.066 --> 24:11.233
He's gonna kill and eat again.
You have to stop him now!

24:12.000 --> 24:13.700
No! No-no! She's lying.

24:13.766 --> 24:15.266
No, it didn't happen that way.

24:15.333 --> 24:17.066
'I didn't want to do this.'

24:17.133 --> 24:18.833
I didn't want to do this.

24:18.900 --> 24:22.600
Yes, hang him.
Hang him now!

24:22.666 --> 24:24.366
'Hanging is too good for him.'

24:24.433 --> 24:27.666
'He should be ripped apart
before he kills again.'

24:27.733 --> 24:29.666
'You must stop him!'

24:29.733 --> 24:31.800
'That was Jane Haeger,
the wife of one of'

24:31.866 --> 24:33.700
'Butcher Morgan's victims.'

24:33.766 --> 24:35.200
'We'll update
Butcher Morgan's escape..'

24:35.266 --> 24:37.700
This is gonna hurt a bit.

24:37.766 --> 24:40.166
'On the local scene,
Travers Corporation President'

24:40.233 --> 24:42.633
'John Travers,
whose plane crashed somewhere'

24:42.700 --> 24:45.000
'in Springwood Forest
is still missing.'

24:45.066 --> 24:47.633
'No sign of wreckage has been
found in the vast mountain..'

24:47.700 --> 24:48.933
- Leg's doing fine.
- Shh! Shh!

24:49.000 --> 24:51.100
'Leaders of the search party
say there is no way'

24:51.166 --> 24:55.100
'Travers or his group consisting
of pilot Ginger Tracker Morgan'

24:55.166 --> 24:58.633
'and two of his vice-presidents
Todd Lawrence and Jake Hopchick'

24:58.700 --> 25:00.833
'could survive
this long without food.'

25:00.900 --> 25:04.633
'Consequently, they are
calling off the search.'

25:04.700 --> 25:07.200
Sorry, Johnny.

25:07.266 --> 25:08.766
'All you Gemini's out there'

25:08.833 --> 25:11.633
'diversify, ask questions,
satisfy your..'

25:11.700 --> 25:14.066
Poor Johnny.

25:14.133 --> 25:15.633
Poor Tracker.

25:15.700 --> 25:17.433
Now that they picked
Todd and Jake clean

25:17.500 --> 25:19.866
they got no more food.

25:19.933 --> 25:20.966
Or do they?

25:21.033 --> 25:23.066
I mean, they got each other.

25:42.700 --> 25:45.333
I never ever had sex like
this before in my life.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.066
Me neither.

25:47.133 --> 25:50.100
It's like laughing
in the face of death.

25:50.166 --> 25:52.866
We also need body warmth
to survive.

25:52.933 --> 25:56.500
This sure generates heat.

25:56.566 --> 25:58.233
Think we better
stop doing it though.

25:58.300 --> 26:00.166
Stop. Why?

26:00.233 --> 26:01.600
Save our strength.

26:01.666 --> 26:02.933
For what?

26:03.000 --> 26:05.100
Search party
has been called off.

26:05.166 --> 26:06.500
We're doomed.

26:06.566 --> 26:08.600
So let's die doing it.

26:13.066 --> 26:15.600
The official search party
has been called off.

26:15.666 --> 26:18.066
The search is still going on.

26:18.133 --> 26:19.933
What are you talking about?

26:21.533 --> 26:23.800
You don't know my fiancee.

26:23.866 --> 26:26.033
Mary Beth will never quit.

26:26.933 --> 26:28.733
'Come on.'

26:38.133 --> 26:39.833
Hey!

26:39.900 --> 26:41.900
Wait up. I've fallen again.

26:43.233 --> 26:44.900
You work for me.

26:47.800 --> 26:49.200
You're walking
that fast on purpose.

26:49.266 --> 26:51.233
You like it
that I keep falling down.

26:52.466 --> 26:54.633
I live for it, ma'am.

26:54.700 --> 26:56.633
It gives me great pleasure
that we're making about

26:56.700 --> 26:58.933
a quarter of a mile an hour.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.333
I don't understand
why you didn't wait back

27:07.400 --> 27:08.933
at the ranger station?

27:09.000 --> 27:10.800
You're just slowing me down.

27:10.866 --> 27:13.300
I am paying you good money
not to let you

27:13.366 --> 27:15.433
let me out of your sight.

27:15.500 --> 27:18.666
You, city folk, have
a lot of problem with trust?

27:18.733 --> 27:21.800
You watch
how you talk to me, pal.

27:21.866 --> 27:25.933
My fiance eats guys
like you for breakfast.

27:26.000 --> 27:27.633
'And when we get back,
I'm gonna--'

27:27.700 --> 27:30.933
Ma'am, I've been
trying to tell you..

27:31.000 --> 27:35.266
...I'm afraid Mr. Travers is
not alive after all this time

27:35.333 --> 27:37.966
'not without backwoods skills.'

27:38.033 --> 27:41.033
'They all perished
in the plane crash.'

27:41.100 --> 27:43.366
I love Johnny and if
there's a slightest chance

27:43.433 --> 27:45.100
'that he is alive,
I'm gonna find him.'

27:45.166 --> 27:46.200
That's admirable.

27:46.266 --> 27:48.633
And all his insurance
is in my name.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.600
And I'm not gonna wait
seven years for them to declare

27:50.666 --> 27:54.166
him legally dead
before I can get my money.

27:54.233 --> 27:55.966
I'll throw his body
in the claims adjusters face

27:56.033 --> 27:57.300
if I have to.

28:01.200 --> 28:04.666
You're a very compassionate
woman, ma'am.

28:04.733 --> 28:06.933
As a matter of fact,
I am.

28:08.366 --> 28:10.333
Now, let's get going.

28:11.500 --> 28:12.800
Yes, ma'am.

28:16.666 --> 28:18.500
And slow down.

28:18.566 --> 28:20.266
Because if I hurt my foot
one more time

28:20.333 --> 28:22.300
you're gonna have to carry me.

28:38.033 --> 28:41.166
You know it's funny,
how life can change.

28:41.233 --> 28:44.766
Mine had become so plastic

28:44.833 --> 28:46.133
Then bam, all of a sudden

28:46.200 --> 28:49.633
all I care about
is sex and flesh.

28:53.033 --> 28:55.666
Maybe it's better that I do die.

28:55.733 --> 28:58.200
I don't think
I could go back anyway.

28:58.266 --> 28:59.666
You're really convinced
your fiancee

28:59.733 --> 29:01.700
is gonna find us, aren't you?

29:01.766 --> 29:04.100
Oh, yeah.

29:04.166 --> 29:06.300
Once she sees that
we've been down here alone

29:06.366 --> 29:09.233
she's gonna accuse us
of having an affair.

29:09.300 --> 29:11.533
Wearehaving an affai

29:11.600 --> 29:12.766
Well, it doesn't make
any difference

29:12.833 --> 29:13.966
whether we are
or whether we aren't

29:14.033 --> 29:16.600
she'd accuse us anyway.

29:16.666 --> 29:18.833
You don't sound
like you love her.

29:19.866 --> 29:22.166
Well, I do love her.

29:22.233 --> 29:25.100
She-she's perfect
for my lifestyles.

29:26.766 --> 29:30.400
For what was my lifestyle.

29:30.466 --> 29:33.300
That was before
I met a woman like you.

29:44.166 --> 29:46.100
Hey, down there!

29:52.366 --> 29:54.333
Are you people okay!

29:54.400 --> 29:56.700
Uh, yeah, yeah!
Yeah, we are fine.

29:56.766 --> 29:58.966
Hey...hey could you get us
outta here?

29:59.033 --> 30:00.400
'Carson!'

30:00.466 --> 30:01.966
'Where the hell are you now?'

30:02.033 --> 30:05.233
'How dare you get away from me
with the money I'm paying you?'

30:05.300 --> 30:07.366
'I could be attacked
by a rabid chipmunk'

30:07.433 --> 30:10.233
or a woodsman.

30:10.300 --> 30:12.400
I saw "Deliverance," you know.

30:12.466 --> 30:14.666
They'd steer clear of you,
ma'am.

30:14.733 --> 30:15.766
Mary Beth?

30:15.833 --> 30:17.633
Or I could fall down and..

30:17.700 --> 30:19.133
Aah!

30:20.833 --> 30:23.600
Johnny! Johnny!

30:23.666 --> 30:25.933
You're alive.
I-I was so worried.

30:27.066 --> 30:28.900
I knew you would be, Mary Beth.

30:28.966 --> 30:31.533
Do you think you could
get us out of here?

30:31.600 --> 30:33.866
Of course. Of course.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.333
Carson! Get them out of there.

30:38.466 --> 30:40.933
Johnny, who's that woman?

30:45.166 --> 30:47.100
What's this stuff?

30:48.533 --> 30:50.966
Some things I needed.

30:51.033 --> 30:54.200
I checked this myself
right before we left.

30:54.266 --> 30:57.033
What happened to our gear?

30:57.100 --> 30:59.866
There wasn't enough room
for my essentials

30:59.933 --> 31:01.866
so I removed some of it.

31:03.133 --> 31:05.533
Our lives depend on this!

31:08.266 --> 31:11.200
Well, where I come from,
my life depends on this!

31:11.266 --> 31:13.733
Look, there's a rope.
Now, pull them out.

31:19.300 --> 31:23.300
There's no way we can pull you
up with the equipment we have.

31:23.366 --> 31:26.100
'The best bet's to go back
and get some help.'

31:27.500 --> 31:29.233
I understand!

31:29.300 --> 31:30.800
Believe me.

31:32.233 --> 31:33.966
Okay, what's the deal?

31:34.033 --> 31:35.966
You want more money?

31:36.033 --> 31:39.200
Ma'am, that's a dead-end canyon!

31:39.266 --> 31:42.433
We fall down there and non
of us are gonna get out!

31:42.500 --> 31:45.966
You are going to be sorry,
buster.

31:46.033 --> 31:48.200
When we get back, I'm gonna
report you to better scouts

31:48.266 --> 31:51.900
bureau or something. And you're
gonna lose your license.

31:51.966 --> 31:54.133
I'll be back
as soon as I can, sir.

31:57.000 --> 31:59.133
You come back here!

32:01.000 --> 32:02.933
Johnny, stop him!

32:04.866 --> 32:07.200
Don't worry, Johnny.
I'll get ya out.

32:07.266 --> 32:09.233
And that woman too.

32:13.100 --> 32:15.300
Where did you say you met her?

32:15.366 --> 32:16.800
Now, Mary Beth, don't try it.

32:16.866 --> 32:19.400
It.. No, wait for help.
Will ya?

32:20.933 --> 32:22.966
Don't worry.

32:23.033 --> 32:26.100
I've hosted plenty of camp-fire
girls meals in my backyard.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.300
Oh, my back.

32:38.100 --> 32:39.533
My back.

32:41.066 --> 32:43.833
Carson, I'm gonna sue you!

32:50.400 --> 32:51.333
Aah!

32:56.500 --> 32:57.433
How could you, how could you,
how could you?

32:57.500 --> 32:58.866
Mary Beth, will you calm down?

32:58.933 --> 33:01.233
'All this time I've been
engaged to a monster.'

33:01.300 --> 33:03.500
Try and understand.

33:03.566 --> 33:05.566
It was either that or die.

33:05.633 --> 33:07.600
Dying's better.

33:09.433 --> 33:11.400
Is that what
you would've wanted?

33:13.566 --> 33:15.000
I haven't been able to sleep

33:15.066 --> 33:17.333
since you were
reported missing.

33:17.400 --> 33:21.033
I-I've been taking diet pills
to stay awake during the day.

33:24.433 --> 33:26.733
You notice I lost a little

33:27.500 --> 33:28.733
You do look good.

33:32.633 --> 33:35.733
I was thinking
...if you were dead..

33:37.200 --> 33:39.233
...I wouldn't want
to go on living?

33:39.933 --> 33:42.033
Till there's a sale.

33:51.333 --> 33:52.866
'Come in, Sergeant Decker.'

33:52.933 --> 33:54.666
'We have information
that Butcher Morgan'

33:54.733 --> 33:56.766
'is due south
of your present position.'

33:56.833 --> 33:58.333
'Seek precaution.'

33:58.400 --> 34:01.300
Okay, we'll head to Rockridge.
Over.

34:01.366 --> 34:03.000
Butcher Morgan
is definitely been sighted

34:03.066 --> 34:05.533
in Springwood forest,
so let's get him.

34:05.600 --> 34:08.133
Before he murders
one of our people.

34:14.433 --> 34:17.800
I thought you said
she had trouble sleeping.

34:17.866 --> 34:20.400
She, uh, takes a nap
every afternoon at 4 o'clock

34:20.466 --> 34:22.733
for her...complexion.

34:27.933 --> 34:29.933
I don't get the two of you.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.800
Nothing stops Mary Beth.

34:34.866 --> 34:37.033
She goes right after
what she wants.

34:38.166 --> 34:39.966
You know she had an affair

34:40.033 --> 34:43.033
with Todd before she found out
I was a corporate president.

34:43.100 --> 34:45.100
But then how many of us
know exactly what we want

34:45.166 --> 34:47.533
and have the guts
to go after it?

34:49.566 --> 34:51.533
But that was all before you.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.800
I'm sorry.

35:03.866 --> 35:05.266
I'm little confused right now.

35:05.333 --> 35:07.500
Probably something you ate

35:08.400 --> 35:10.666
I'm just making a point.

35:10.733 --> 35:12.400
I mean how could you
not be confused.

35:12.466 --> 35:14.200
You barely survive
a plane crash

35:14.266 --> 35:17.433
and you've been eating
your two vice presidents.

35:17.500 --> 35:20.133
Sheds a whole new light
on office politics, hmm?

35:20.800 --> 35:22.000
Hey.

35:23.933 --> 35:26.433
What about us?

35:26.500 --> 35:28.066
What about her?

35:28.133 --> 35:30.533
What're you two doing?

35:32.633 --> 35:34.500
Uh, uh, nothing.

35:36.333 --> 35:41.200
Nothing...like when we
were at the Anderson party?

35:41.266 --> 35:43.866
Mary Beth,
that was a long time ago.

35:43.933 --> 35:45.366
Do what you will.

35:45.433 --> 35:48.266
But I've had my share too.

35:48.333 --> 35:51.033
Remember when I was with Todd.

35:51.100 --> 35:53.166
You'll never let me forget it.

35:53.233 --> 35:56.633
Boy, did he have meat on him.

35:56.700 --> 35:59.066
Built like a bull.

35:59.133 --> 36:02.100
He had a-a..

36:04.133 --> 36:06.933
Todd! Todd!

36:16.133 --> 36:17.800
Nice clothes.

36:17.866 --> 36:19.966
I could use 'em.

36:20.033 --> 36:22.700
So can I.
So you're out of luck.

36:24.966 --> 36:27.233
Okay, okay.
Take it easy.

36:27.300 --> 36:28.633
You can have 'em.

36:28.700 --> 36:30.633
Too late, man.

36:30.700 --> 36:33.033
I don't give second chances.

36:37.766 --> 36:39.833
Hey, Johnny,
where are we going?

36:39.900 --> 36:41.766
Remember when I used
to sneak away from the office?

36:41.833 --> 36:45.166
Oh, and you'd take me
for a nice romantic lunch.

36:45.233 --> 36:47.266
- Yeah.
- Hmm!

36:47.333 --> 36:48.466
I don't see why
this should be any different.

36:48.533 --> 36:49.633
Oh!

36:51.166 --> 36:52.933
Oh, Johnny.

36:54.300 --> 36:55.533
Oh, Johnny.

36:57.300 --> 36:58.433
Now, why don't you lie down?

36:58.500 --> 37:01.000
Oh, Johnny, you devil.

37:02.466 --> 37:05.433
Oh, Johnny.
Oh, how kinky.

37:05.500 --> 37:08.300
Oh, take me. Take me.

37:08.366 --> 37:09.600
Oh!

37:11.300 --> 37:13.033
What is she doing here?

37:13.100 --> 37:15.433
I am here to serve you.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.566
Huh.

37:16.633 --> 37:18.000
Johnny, breast or thigh.

37:18.066 --> 37:19.766
Johnny, please!

37:19.833 --> 37:22.933
Survival.
I'm sorry, Mary Beth.

37:23.000 --> 37:24.666
I had to make a decision.

37:24.733 --> 37:27.333
Besides, she's not fat.

37:27.400 --> 37:28.733
Huh!

37:34.666 --> 37:37.333
Mary Beth.
Mary Beth, are you okay?

37:37.400 --> 37:40.400
- I'm not fat.
- What was that for?

37:40.466 --> 37:41.966
As if you didn't know.

37:42.033 --> 37:44.333
- Don't get crazy on me.
- Me, crazy?

37:44.400 --> 37:47.033
I haven't resorted
to eating people.

37:47.100 --> 37:49.933
No, no!
You get that away from me.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.000
Mary Beth, you have to eat
or you're gonna die.

37:52.066 --> 37:54.200
It's as simple as that.

37:54.266 --> 37:56.033
I'd rather die.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.100
Do you eat rabbit?

37:58.166 --> 38:00.833
Well, yes.
I've had rabbit.

38:00.900 --> 38:04.800
Chez Poulet prepares
Lapin do cuisine.

38:04.866 --> 38:06.133
'It's very elegant.'

38:06.200 --> 38:09.400
Well, Tracker doesn't feature
same sauces, but, uh..

38:10.733 --> 38:13.600
I'm not a sissy.
I can handle rabbit.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.566
'Johnny, sometimes I think
you don't like me anymore.'

38:20.633 --> 38:23.233
'I'm not a bad person.'

38:23.300 --> 38:24.800
'I know that.'

38:24.866 --> 38:28.166
I don't wear hiking boots,
but I'm still a woman.

38:28.233 --> 38:30.333
I'm sorry, Mary Beth.

38:44.900 --> 38:47.200
How is it?

38:47.266 --> 38:49.833
It's a little rough,
but it's not bad.

38:51.200 --> 38:53.200
'Is this like a rabbit?'

38:53.266 --> 38:55.933
No. Arm of Todd.

38:58.400 --> 39:00.333
Mary Beth,
it's all in your head.

39:00.400 --> 39:02.633
You thought it was okay.

39:04.100 --> 39:06.133
I'm afraid
this is our last meal.

39:06.200 --> 39:09.000
- The bodies are rotting.
- 'You're sure?'

39:09.066 --> 39:10.866
'Hmm-mm.'

39:10.933 --> 39:12.533
'We're out of food.'

39:14.666 --> 39:17.333
'Backwoods guide, Ben Carson
was found shot to death'

39:17.400 --> 39:19.066
'in Springwood Forest today.'

39:19.133 --> 39:21.733
'It was clearly
the work of Morgan'

39:23.533 --> 39:26.566
Now, we're stuck here forever.

39:26.633 --> 39:29.500
Without food.

39:29.566 --> 39:31.933
And only each other.

39:53.166 --> 39:54.500
Oh!

39:55.900 --> 39:58.833
- I can't stand not having you.
- Johnny.

39:59.566 --> 40:01.300
Oh. Oh!

40:03.900 --> 40:05.766
The thought of being
with Mary Beth sickens me.

40:05.833 --> 40:06.900
Yeah..

40:06.966 --> 40:09.833
And when I'm with you,
I feel like a man.

40:09.900 --> 40:11.800
I feel alive.

40:12.900 --> 40:15.600
- I'm yours forever.
- Oh, Johnny.

40:15.666 --> 40:18.500
'Johnny!'

40:18.566 --> 40:20.833
'Johnny, are you
with that woman?'

40:24.133 --> 40:26.433
Uh, well, um..

40:26.500 --> 40:27.566
Will you excuse me
for a minute?

40:27.633 --> 40:31.500
Uh...I'll just,
uh, get rid of her.

40:31.566 --> 40:33.733
I'll-I'll be right back.

40:51.600 --> 40:55.533
'Johnny, didn't you go
to the grocery store?'

41:03.900 --> 41:08.033
Johnny...I can't
let you shop anymore.

41:11.833 --> 41:14.333
'You just don't know
what good meat is.'

41:40.866 --> 41:42.933
I know this has changed
everything.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.733
'Do you love her?'

41:47.800 --> 41:49.900
Mary Beth, she saved my life.

41:49.966 --> 41:51.666
But what about when it's over?

41:51.733 --> 41:53.400
Do you think you could take her
to Chez Poulet

41:53.466 --> 41:55.100
with the way
she tears at her food?

41:55.166 --> 41:58.100
Only you would think of that.

41:58.166 --> 42:01.500
'Listen, I'm afraid we're never
gonna be in a restaurant again.'

42:01.566 --> 42:04.133
What are you two
talking about?

42:04.200 --> 42:07.533
- Not about you, missy.
- Okay.

42:07.600 --> 42:10.600
Why don't we just lay our cards
right out on the table?

42:10.666 --> 42:13.033
We don't play the same game.

42:13.100 --> 42:15.733
Mine's bridge, not strip poker.

42:15.800 --> 42:17.800
Now, come on.
What are you two talking about?

42:17.866 --> 42:20.800
We were doing just fine
until you showed up.

42:20.866 --> 42:22.366
Something's gotta give.

42:22.433 --> 42:24.733
Face it, Mary Beth,
I am Johnny's only hope

42:24.800 --> 42:25.933
of getting outta here.

42:26.000 --> 42:29.500
With me gone, the two of you
are gonna die anyway.

42:29.566 --> 42:31.366
Johnny and I spent
the last few years

42:31.433 --> 42:33.633
of our lives together.

42:33.700 --> 42:36.233
We should finish them together.

42:36.300 --> 42:38.666
Do you have the nerve
to let Johnny decide?

42:38.733 --> 42:40.600
- Decide what?
- I do.

42:40.666 --> 42:44.233
- Fine.
- Johnny, decide.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.400
Her...or me?

42:48.166 --> 42:49.666
Oh, uh..

42:49.733 --> 42:52.300
I mean, do I have
to decide that?

42:52.366 --> 42:55.433
Y-you know, we could
all have fun together.

42:55.500 --> 42:56.933
We could take turns.

42:57.000 --> 42:59.033
Not sex, you animal.

43:00.166 --> 43:02.966
Between her or me.
Who gets eaten?

43:03.033 --> 43:05.933
Eaten? Is that what
we were talking about?

43:07.866 --> 43:09.933
Well, nobody's gonna get eaten.

43:10.000 --> 43:12.966
I-I mean, we only ate these guys
because they were already dead.

43:13.033 --> 43:14.766
That's one thing,
but to kill somebody for food

43:14.833 --> 43:16.466
that's an entirely
different story.

43:16.533 --> 43:19.666
And we're not gonna do that.
Do you understand?

43:19.733 --> 43:23.166
But we have to have
something to eat.

43:23.233 --> 43:25.733
Oh! Oh, whoa.

43:27.433 --> 43:29.033
Damn.

43:29.100 --> 43:31.933
I didn't see that coming.

43:32.000 --> 43:33.933
Who are you?

43:46.833 --> 43:49.666
Thank God you found us.
I was all out of clean clothes.

43:49.733 --> 43:53.333
You folks are lucky we were out
looking for Butcher Morgan.

43:53.400 --> 43:55.400
Dog's on the scent.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.566
Have you seen anyone
come through here?

43:57.633 --> 43:59.533
No.

43:59.600 --> 44:02.533
Well, he's gotta be
around here somewhere.

44:06.300 --> 44:07.733
Oh.

44:07.800 --> 44:09.366
Craziest thing I've ever seen.

44:09.433 --> 44:11.000
Alright.

44:11.066 --> 44:13.866
Anyway you men
and, uh, dogs, keep hunting.

44:13.933 --> 44:15.600
I'm gonna take these folks
back to my truck

44:15.666 --> 44:17.166
and then to a hospital.

44:17.233 --> 44:18.433
- Great.
- Follow me, folks.

44:18.500 --> 44:19.500
Okay.

44:26.866 --> 44:28.633
You folks must be starving.

44:28.700 --> 44:31.133
Well, I got plenty of food
in the jeep.

44:31.200 --> 44:34.066
Beef, soups, cheese.

44:34.133 --> 44:36.300
So tell me,
what would you like to eat?

44:37.100 --> 44:38.466
Thigh.

44:38.533 --> 44:39.700
Arm.

44:39.766 --> 44:41.200
Rump.

44:43.200 --> 44:44.433
Hi.

44:44.500 --> 44:48.466
Here to show you the latest
from Freddy's Farms.

44:48.533 --> 44:49.966
Yee-haw!

44:50.033 --> 44:52.533
Yes siree.
Just pop it in the oven.

44:52.600 --> 44:56.533
And in three minutes,
mmm, he's ready.

44:56.600 --> 44:58.300
Ha ha!

44:58.366 --> 45:00.533
Bet you can't eat just one.
