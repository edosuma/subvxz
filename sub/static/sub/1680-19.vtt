<i>Kids, in the spring of 2008,</i>

00:03.467 --> 00:06.097
<i>something kinda strange had been
happening to your Uncle Barney.</i>

00:06.506 --> 00:08.004
<i>He'd be doing
great with a woman...</i>

00:08.103 --> 00:10.521
So I throw the pressurized
oxygen tank in his mouth,

00:10.621 --> 00:13.082
I shoot the tank, boom!
No more shark.

00:13.182 --> 00:15.469
Mr. Holland and I
swim back to shore.

00:15.952 --> 00:17.234
Let me freshen your drink.

00:17.880 --> 00:21.256
<i>He'd only be gone a few moments,
but when he returned...</i>

00:21.356 --> 00:22.728
So where were we?

00:22.996 --> 00:24.071
<i>...he'd get slapped.</i>

00:24.663 --> 00:25.964
<i>It kept happening.</i>

00:29.091 --> 00:31.996
<i>Until finally, Lily was approached
by a mysterious woman</i>

00:32.100 --> 00:34.417
<i>who warned her
to stay away from Barney.</i>

00:35.090 --> 00:36.972
<i>So when it happened once more...</i>

00:37.379 --> 00:40.542
Again?!
Really?! Wait...

00:40.749 --> 00:42.712
<i>...Barney knew who to look for.</i>

Hey, excuse me.

01:03.949 --> 01:05.882
Did I sleep with you and
then totally screw you over?

01:06.197 --> 01:07.361
No.

01:09.499 --> 01:11.204
What are you doing on Friday?

01:20.227 --> 01:20.961
Amy?

01:21.427 --> 01:22.234
Abby.

01:24.059 --> 01:25.921

<i>How I Met Your Mother
3x19 - Everything Must Go</i>

01:37.318 --> 01:39.831
<i>for the "Have You Met Team"
for www.forom.com</i>

01:41.347 --> 01:45.264
<i>Kids, sometimes you can do something
right a thousand times in a row...</i>

01:45.366 --> 01:48.514
A rainbow!
That's beautiful!

01:49.699 --> 01:52.461
What a beautiful rainbow!

01:53.309 --> 01:57.593
Another rainbow?
It's beautiful!

01:57.816 --> 02:00.214
<i>But then, that
thousand-and-first time...</i>

02:00.797 --> 02:04.254
You're kidding me. Seriously,
aren't you sick of these things?

02:08.247 --> 02:09.782
Hey, how was yo day?

02:09.888 --> 02:12.563
Today, I yelled at a little girl
for painting a rainbow.

02:12.786 --> 02:16.224
A rainbow? Sounds like
that bitch had it coming.

02:19.229 --> 02:22.704
So, uh, I just met with the contractor.

02:22.806 --> 02:25.173
And it turns out, that fixing
the floors of the new apartment

02:25.278 --> 02:27.113
is going to cost a lot more
than the estimate.

02:27.219 --> 02:30.122
But we can barely
afford that to begin with.

02:30.328 --> 02:31.964
I hate to say this,

02:32.329 --> 02:34.371
but I think you're going to have
to sell your stuff.

02:34.577 --> 02:37.834
Whoa! Marshall, that's just a game
we play in the bedroom.

02:38.827 --> 02:41.753
I mean your clothes. All those
designer pieces and everything.

02:41.959 --> 02:44.254
What?
Why just my clothes?

02:44.358 --> 02:46.502
We can sell my stuff, too,
but I got to tell you,

02:46.608 --> 02:49.733
I think your Marc Jacobs cocktail dress
is going to go for a lot more than my

02:49.837 --> 02:51.882
- "Split Happens" bowling shirt.
- Dude.

02:51.986 --> 02:53.534
I'm not selling that.

02:55.447 --> 02:58.464
- I've already made the Website.
- You made a Website?

02:58.567 --> 03:03.941
Yeah, it's called "Lily-and-Marshall
-sell-their-stuff-dot-com."

03:05.029 --> 03:07.982
No, you know what would be
a better name for the site?

03:08.086 --> 03:15.412
Guy-forces-his-wife-to-dress-in-a-garbage
-bag-for-the-next-three-years-dot-com.

03:16.936 --> 03:18.291
That's real.

03:18.826 --> 03:22.672
Now I'm worried. That woman is actually
wearing a garbage bag.

03:23.199 --> 03:26.673
Hmm, but, girlfriend,
you cannot pull off a tall kitchen.

03:27.728 --> 03:30.031
Why are you trying
to ruin my life?

03:30.139 --> 03:32.344
Well, you slept with me and
then you never called me again.

03:33.437 --> 03:34.933
- And?
- That's it.

03:35.136 --> 03:36.151
That's it?

03:36.728 --> 03:38.593
As far as I'm concerned,
if I leave you safe on dry land

03:38.698 --> 03:41.272
with adequate transportation home,
you've got nothing to complain about.

03:41.578 --> 03:43.012
Well, it hurt, okay?

03:43.116 --> 03:46.344
And then Ted, the love of my life,
started dating my boss instead of me.

03:46.669 --> 03:48.032
Do you know how that feels?

03:48.139 --> 03:51.151
Oh, boo-hoo, poor little Ashley.

03:51.358 --> 03:53.284
- Abby!
- Abby.

03:53.689 --> 03:56.614
A few weeks ago, Ted
dumped me as his wingman.

03:57.097 --> 03:58.863
You had a crush on him
for a couple weeks?

03:58.967 --> 04:01.174
I was Ted's best friend
for seven years.

04:01.278 --> 04:04.122
- Ted said Marshall was his best friend.
- Seven years!

04:05.058 --> 04:05.793
Sorry.

04:06.458 --> 04:08.133
Ted.
What an idiot.

04:08.826 --> 04:12.924
With his stupid "meaningful
relationship" with Stella.

04:13.339 --> 04:15.174
- Ted.
- Ted.

04:15.449 --> 04:17.814
- I hate Ted.
- I hate Ted more.

04:17.916 --> 04:21.291
- Are you as turned on as I am?
- Probably not quite as much.

04:23.749 --> 04:25.801
I'm sorry I yelled out "Ted."

04:25.906 --> 04:27.992
I'm sorry I yelled out "Abby."

04:28.769 --> 04:30.452
I am Abby.

04:31.337 --> 04:32.322
Oh, cool.

04:33.646 --> 04:34.782
This is insane.

04:34.987 --> 04:36.742
Has Lily even worn
half this stuff?

04:36.948 --> 04:39.663
Oh, yeah, like there's nothing in your
closet you've never worn?

04:39.936 --> 04:41.853
As a matter of fact,
no, there isn't.

04:41.958 --> 04:44.084
Whatever, red cowboy boots.

04:44.289 --> 04:46.962
Those are nice boots.
I totally pull those off.

04:49.118 --> 04:51.492
If I were to say
"Ted could never pull them off,"

04:51.599 --> 04:53.641
- what would I be talking about?
- His red cowboy boots.

04:53.748 --> 04:57.264
I totally pull them off!
It's a classic Western look.

04:57.768 --> 04:59.984
Oh, okay, uh, today's category:

05:00.367 --> 05:03.601
classic Westerns that involve
red cowboy boots.

05:04.557 --> 05:05.343
Robin.

05:05.547 --> 05:07.521
"The Good, the Bad,
and the Fabulous."

05:09.646 --> 05:11.153
"The Magnificent Kevin."

05:12.438 --> 05:14.601
"No Country for Straight Men."

05:16.579 --> 05:18.743
I don't want to sell my clothes!

05:18.949 --> 05:20.774
I know, sweetie.
Come here.

05:22.886 --> 05:24.164
Is this a hundred percent silk?

05:25.616 --> 05:27.642
Lily, listen,
we really need the money.

05:27.747 --> 05:30.514
I have some leads on a job,
but until then, I just...

05:30.928 --> 05:32.134
I don't know what else
we can do.

05:33.868 --> 05:35.554
I'll sell my paintings!

05:36.377 --> 05:36.962
What?

05:37.166 --> 05:38.971
Yeah, I'll sell my paintings.

05:39.008 --> 05:41.603
Good oil paintings go for like, $500.

05:42.207 --> 05:44.104
Yeah.
Totally.

05:44.558 --> 05:45.252
But...

05:45.358 --> 05:48.732
<i>Kids, sometimes you can do something
right a thousand times in a row...</i>

05:49.186 --> 05:50.104
I love it.

05:50.309 --> 05:51.931
It's a masterpiece.

05:54.099 --> 05:55.771
That's it.
We're selling the TV.

05:55.979 --> 05:58.244
I just want to come home
and stare at this all day.

06:00.016 --> 06:01.491
Somebody call the cops!

06:01.696 --> 06:04.611
My wife stole an awesome painting
from the museum!

06:07.388 --> 06:09.704
<i>But then, that
thousand-and-first time...</i>

06:09.806 --> 06:12.262
...that kind of money
only goes for real paintings.

06:14.598 --> 06:15.881
What does that mean?

06:16.957 --> 06:21.321
Look, it just means that we need money
right now and I'm not sure that

06:21.428 --> 06:23.682
selling your paintings
is how we're going to get it.

06:24.216 --> 06:25.832
You don't believe in me.

06:27.206 --> 06:29.353
No, wait, wait!
Of c...

06:29.556 --> 06:30.932
of course I believe in you!

06:31.139 --> 06:33.704
Marshall, I am proud
of my work as an artist.

06:33.809 --> 06:37.023
My paintings are good.
I bet Robin would buy one.

06:37.309 --> 06:38.231
What now?

06:39.677 --> 06:43.071
I love your painting, I just...
I'm trying to be realistic.

06:44.136 --> 06:47.164
Well, how much money do we need
for the contractor to finish the job?

06:47.367 --> 06:48.711
About 1,500 bucks.

06:49.818 --> 06:54.222
So, if I can sell three of my paintings
at 500 bucks a pop, then

06:54.327 --> 06:56.142
I get to keep all my clothes.

06:56.998 --> 07:00.022
- We need money fast.
- Well, give me a week.

07:01.746 --> 07:03.222
Okay, a week.

07:03.499 --> 07:04.594
- Fine.
- Fine.

07:04.918 --> 07:06.054
Fine.

07:18.098 --> 07:21.414
Pulling. Them. Off.

07:27.476 --> 07:30.380
<i>Lily's first move in the great
art challenge of 2008</i>

07:30.484 --> 07:33.712
<i>was to display one of her favorite
paintings at her friend's gallery.</i>

07:33.817 --> 07:35.452
<i>The night didn't go so well.</i>

07:41.506 --> 07:43.482
<i>But then at the last minute...</i>

07:43.586 --> 07:45.621
- I love it.
- You do?

07:45.907 --> 07:48.770
Your top. It's gorgeous.
Is that 100% silk?

07:48.877 --> 07:51.869
It's not for sale!
My clothes are not for sale!

07:52.081 --> 07:54.722
<i>So the next day, Lily took
her painting to a coffee house</i>

07:54.819 --> 07:56.504
<i>that displayed local artists.</i>

07:56.758 --> 08:00.595
We've been sitting here for hours and
nobody's even glanced at my painting.

08:01.098 --> 08:02.930
Come on.
Let's start talking it up.

08:04.946 --> 08:07.101
I really like that painting!

08:07.307 --> 08:08.881
It's neat!

08:08.986 --> 08:11.082
The-the colors are neat.

08:11.187 --> 08:12.860
The-the shapes are neat.

08:13.164 --> 08:15.999
It's really just...
neat.

08:18.174 --> 08:18.870
What?

08:20.217 --> 08:21.242
Observe.

08:22.337 --> 08:25.560
I think there's a dynamic quality
to the brushwork that,

08:25.667 --> 08:27.421
combined with the fluid composition,

08:27.527 --> 08:30.462
creates an almost
Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.

08:31.817 --> 08:36.462
Yes, and you can still enjoy it
even if you're not a pretentious douche.

08:38.256 --> 08:40.172
Can you clarify something
for me about your critique?

08:40.277 --> 08:43.552
Are the colors "neat" or
are they more "neato burrito?"

08:45.585 --> 08:47.560
Uh, then again,
red cowboy boots.

08:47.666 --> 08:52.232
I pull these off!
I pull these off!

08:52.837 --> 08:54.792
You know what
I hate most about Ted?

08:54.894 --> 08:55.732
What?

08:56.065 --> 08:57.922
His stupid hair.

08:58.166 --> 09:00.782
His stupid, lame awesome hair.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.452
It's so stupid and awesome.

09:05.726 --> 09:06.990
You know what
I hate most about Ted?

09:07.024 --> 09:07.751
What?

09:07.834 --> 09:11.820
How he's always like, "Oh, I want to
fall in love and have a relationship.

09:11.926 --> 09:15.379
I care about the people I have
sex with." He's so lame.

09:15.587 --> 09:17.209
He's so lame and awesome.

09:20.025 --> 09:21.291
You know what he needs?

09:21.396 --> 09:24.721
He needs to see just how horrible
he is when he's in a relationship.

09:25.024 --> 09:28.509
Yeah, and I need to show Ted
that I'm over him.

09:29.224 --> 09:30.681
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

09:31.635 --> 09:32.811
I think so.

09:33.054 --> 09:35.191
You're thinking
of having sex with Ted?

09:37.735 --> 09:41.801
<i>After four days without selling a single
painting, Lily was getting desperate.</i>

09:41.905 --> 09:45.011
Painting for sale!
$500!

09:45.114 --> 09:47.991
Lifelong dream
hanging in the balance!

09:49.864 --> 09:52.010
It's like they don't even see us.

09:52.117 --> 09:53.961
Yeah, we're dirt to them.

09:54.447 --> 09:56.129
What do you need money for?

09:56.237 --> 09:59.272
Oh, I'm trying to fix the hardwood
floors in my new apartment.

09:59.374 --> 10:00.251
You?

10:00.685 --> 10:01.802
Heroin.

10:05.407 --> 10:07.761
- Do you like heroin?
- Love it.

10:07.867 --> 10:10.930
If you sell that, I'm going to take
your money and go buy some more heroin.

10:12.956 --> 10:15.542
Thanks for your honesty,
Crazy Sock Guy.

10:17.485 --> 10:20.321
- Oh, I'm never gonna sell this...
- It's not very good.

10:22.166 --> 10:24.741
<i>And just as she was about
to lose all hope,</i>

10:24.845 --> 10:26.629
<i>something amazing happened.</i>

10:27.746 --> 10:28.992
Oh, my God!

10:30.207 --> 10:33.310
500 bucks! Who's a real
painter now, Marshall?

10:33.415 --> 10:35.500
Honey, I never said
you weren't a real painter.

10:35.705 --> 10:37.229
I know, sweetie.

10:37.334 --> 10:40.349
And since I'm a
professional artist now,

10:40.457 --> 10:42.991
I'm going to sketch you
an Aldrin original,

10:43.097 --> 10:46.492
you know, to say thanks for being
such a supportive husband.

10:46.595 --> 10:48.480
I'm thinking about calling it...

10:48.586 --> 10:49.802
"Suck It!"

10:50.325 --> 10:53.722
Lily, come on. I'm proud of you.
Who-who bought it?

10:54.116 --> 10:57.181
Well, that's the best part.
A gay couple without kids.

10:57.287 --> 10:58.982
A G-CWOK!

10:59.245 --> 11:02.021
- You bagged a G-CWOK?!
- Yeah, that's right.

11:02.125 --> 11:04.872
They are the heart and soul
of the art-buying community.

11:04.975 --> 11:07.381
You know what you should do?
You should call up the G-CWOKs

11:07.576 --> 11:09.779
and offer them a free painting
if they throw a private art party

11:09.886 --> 11:11.500
for all their G-CWOK friends.

11:11.606 --> 11:14.570
That's an amazing idea.
I'm going to go call them.

11:14.674 --> 11:17.882
I can probably sell two more
paintings with time to spare.

11:18.316 --> 11:22.019
Oh, wait, Marshall. There was something
I had to tell you. What was it?

11:22.127 --> 11:23.520
Oh, that's right.

11:23.656 --> 11:24.670
Suck it.

11:32.186 --> 11:33.232
Hey.

11:33.616 --> 11:36.232
Ted, fancy bumping
into you here.

11:36.496 --> 11:38.642
Have you guys met
my girlfriend Abby?

11:39.215 --> 11:42.321
- Uh, yeah. Hi, Abby. So...
- Hello, Abby.

11:42.814 --> 11:44.292
So you guys are dating now?

11:44.486 --> 11:45.361
That's right.

11:45.814 --> 11:48.100
I am done with this
whole being awesome thing.

11:48.344 --> 11:50.581
Now I'm all about
farmers' markets and

11:50.684 --> 11:53.910
day hikes in matching khaki cargo
shorts. Isn't that right, sweetie?

11:54.116 --> 11:56.941
That's right.
And girlfriends are lame.

11:57.045 --> 11:59.422
Unless they're me.
I miss you, Ted.

12:00.664 --> 12:02.669
Abby and I are in love.

12:03.014 --> 12:04.989
Not hot passionate love.

12:05.096 --> 12:06.401
Couple love.

12:06.504 --> 12:08.880
You know, movie night
with my girlfriend,

12:08.986 --> 12:10.651
then waiting for her
to go to bed

12:10.757 --> 12:13.600
so I can steal one pitiful moment
of hollow ecstasy

12:13.704 --> 12:16.099
by the cold, blue light
of my computer monitor.

12:17.345 --> 12:19.570
We're showing Ted
how lame he is.

12:19.805 --> 12:21.779
You don't have to say it, though.

12:22.307 --> 12:24.939
Uh, okay, Barney,
you can stop.

12:25.147 --> 12:27.291
Stop what, Ted?
Stop being in love?

12:27.394 --> 12:29.569
Next he'll ask us to stop breathing.

12:30.515 --> 12:32.342
We can't stop breathing, Ted.

12:32.447 --> 12:34.120
Your hair looks amazing.

12:35.866 --> 12:38.702
Barney, I, I see what you're doing.
Please stop.

12:38.905 --> 12:42.920
Not before I share with you what
being in a relationship leads to, Ted.

12:43.567 --> 12:46.052
Abby, Pookie Bear...

12:46.687 --> 12:50.670
I am so pathetically
desperate for you, that...

12:51.057 --> 12:53.062
aw, heck, I'll just say it.

12:56.186 --> 12:59.312
- Will you marry me?
- Wait, really?

12:59.847 --> 13:02.519
I would never joke about true love.

13:03.624 --> 13:06.131
- Yes, I'll marry you.
- Okay.

13:07.827 --> 13:09.861
Thank you, thank you.

13:10.285 --> 13:12.280
I have to call my mom.

13:13.536 --> 13:14.739
That's you.

13:16.236 --> 13:18.419
Uh, yeah, I don't think
Abby knows you're kidding.

13:18.527 --> 13:20.080
Uh, yes, she does.

13:20.357 --> 13:22.269
It finally happened, Mama.

13:22.455 --> 13:25.079
I just wish Daddy were alive
to walk me down the aisle.

13:26.796 --> 13:28.460
Totally committed to the bit.

13:29.685 --> 13:32.722
Yes, Lily Aldrin.
I sold you the painting earlier today.

13:32.926 --> 13:34.401
Oh, honey, hello.

13:34.505 --> 13:35.720
You sound happy.

13:35.924 --> 13:38.059
Are you kidding? We're popping
the champagne right now.

13:38.925 --> 13:42.229
Well, I just wanted to offer you
an exclusive chance

13:42.335 --> 13:44.309
to view some of my other paintings.

13:44.514 --> 13:48.569
Oh, honey, oh, sweetie, oh,
I guess I should have told you.

13:48.764 --> 13:50.480
We just bought that for the frame.

13:51.377 --> 13:52.082
What?

13:52.186 --> 13:53.969
Yeah, it's an original
Anton Kreutzer,

13:54.077 --> 13:55.992
a very rare frame
from the turn of the century.

13:56.607 --> 13:59.620
So... you didn't like my painting?

13:59.824 --> 14:02.832
Oh, honey, oh, sweetie,
no, not at all.

14:03.506 --> 14:05.802
But you know,
good for you.

14:09.444 --> 14:12.649
Well, if you didn't want
the painting, can I...

14:13.005 --> 14:14.979
can I at least get it back?

14:15.265 --> 14:17.640
Yeah, no,
we don't have it anymore.

14:18.267 --> 14:19.182
Where is it?

14:21.516 --> 14:22.459
I see.

14:24.177 --> 14:25.731
H-He threw out my painting.

14:27.397 --> 14:29.651
Champagne for everyone,
on me,

14:29.917 --> 14:32.282
the happiest guy in the world.

14:34.925 --> 14:36.562
Ginger ale.
It's a bit.

14:40.984 --> 14:42.326
This is great.

14:42.434 --> 14:44.466
My dream of becoming
an artist is dead,

14:44.572 --> 14:48.466
and now I'm watching my wardrobe
disappear piece by piece.

14:49.284 --> 14:50.989
There goes my favorite dress.

14:52.211 --> 14:53.628
This dress meant a lot to me.

14:53.992 --> 14:55.828
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:56.052 --> 15:00.346
It was spring of 2004 and
I had been having a hard few months.

15:02.613 --> 15:04.419
Day-am.

15:05.611 --> 15:08.159
I got a two-syllable "damn"
in this dress.

15:08.531 --> 15:10.486
A two-syllable "damn."

15:11.054 --> 15:12.777
- That's the dream.
- Yeah.

15:13.181 --> 15:19.156
Now she belongs to...
CanadaGirl@MetroNewsOne.com.

15:19.481 --> 15:20.908
It's still in the family.

15:22.583 --> 15:24.668
Lily, you're not going to believe this.

15:24.992 --> 15:26.588
- Something amazing happened.
- What?

15:27.142 --> 15:28.846
I went to the G-CWOK's apartment.

15:29.013 --> 15:30.178
Really? Why?

15:30.281 --> 15:31.839
Because I felt guilty.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.939
This auction was my idea and now
you've had to sit around all day

15:35.042 --> 15:39.307
while a bunch of vultures ruthlessly
ick apart the carcass of your wardrobe.

15:41.652 --> 15:43.416
It's still in the family.

15:43.811 --> 15:45.156
And more importantly,

15:45.261 --> 15:47.208
I honestly love that painting and

15:47.311 --> 15:49.937
I couldn't stand to think of it
in a trashcan someplace.

15:50.381 --> 15:51.659
Well, what happened?

15:53.184 --> 15:54.419
Well, hello.

15:54.523 --> 15:58.766
Hi, um... Lawrence. I'm here about
the painting my wife Lily sold you...

15:59.071 --> 16:00.728
the one in the nice frame.

16:01.072 --> 16:04.818
Talk about a nice frame.
My, my, you are a big one, aren't you?

16:04.922 --> 16:07.668
And you're married to that little bit
of a thing. How does that work?

16:08.364 --> 16:09.658
I'd like to find out.

16:10.553 --> 16:12.349
Yeah, we get it.
Gay guys like you.

16:12.914 --> 16:14.347
No, Lily,

16:14.704 --> 16:17.069
they love me,
but that's not the important part.

16:17.284 --> 16:18.839
Here's the important part.

16:19.221 --> 16:22.048
Since you're clearly a man
of impeccable taste and style,

16:22.152 --> 16:23.987
I came down here to ask you:

16:25.331 --> 16:27.178
what do you think of the boots?

16:32.732 --> 16:33.489
Boots.

16:38.824 --> 16:41.826
Pulling. Them. Off.

16:45.782 --> 16:47.069
I'll be in the cab.

16:51.691 --> 16:53.048
G-CWOK-approved.

16:53.252 --> 16:54.379
The painting.

16:54.813 --> 16:57.886
Right, so, um, they told me they
threw it in the building's Dumpster.

16:58.551 --> 17:02.158
<i>It wasn't in there, but the super
told me that he'd seen one Dr. Greer,</i>

17:02.264 --> 17:03.686
<i>a veterinarian who
works in the building,</i>

17:03.794 --> 17:05.348
<i>take the painting out of the trash.</i>

17:05.672 --> 17:09.695
Dr. Greer? Who's Dr. Greer and
why did he take my painting?

17:10.342 --> 17:11.837
You're about to find out.

17:13.894 --> 17:15.766
Long story short,
I had to make a trash run.

17:15.874 --> 17:17.568
Been a busy day...
lots of neuterings.

17:17.671 --> 17:18.857
Ooh, we don't need the details.

17:18.963 --> 17:20.665
Oh, no no no,
it's not what you think.

17:21.101 --> 17:23.478
Yeah, yeah, yeah, mostly
just dog testicles. Anyway...

17:24.703 --> 17:26.297
<i>I noticed your painting</i>

17:26.403 --> 17:30.707
<i>just sitting right there on top
and I thought, "Hey, free painting,"</i>

17:31.562 --> 17:35.139
<i>so I brought it upstairs and
hung it up in Exam Room 3,</i>

17:35.244 --> 17:37.649
<i>and then the strangest
thing happened.</i>

17:40.032 --> 17:41.716
Hey, Muffin.

17:43.182 --> 17:46.018
Whoa, I think he remembers me
from the last time he was here.

17:47.893 --> 17:50.717
Take Muffin to Exam Room 3.
I'll meet you there.

17:52.104 --> 17:54.227
<i>I went in, expecting the worst.</i>

17:56.801 --> 17:59.836
<i>I'd never seen Muffin that calm,</i>

18:00.202 --> 18:04.187
<i>and then a little later the same thing
happened again with Tidbit...</i>

18:04.751 --> 18:06.458
<i>and King Larry...</i>

18:07.724 --> 18:10.697
<i>and again
with the Weinstein triplets.</i>

18:13.423 --> 18:14.958
Something about your art

18:15.063 --> 18:18.287
speaks to the canine sensibility
on a very primal level.

18:18.521 --> 18:21.587
- Really? Dogs like my paintings?
- Yeah.

18:21.793 --> 18:24.388
But you know who it bums out?
Birds.

18:25.691 --> 18:28.139
Had a parrot in there today.
He took one look at it,

18:28.244 --> 18:31.348
pried open his cage,
flew right into the ceiling fan.

18:35.473 --> 18:37.606
Anyway, because your first
painting worked so well,

18:37.713 --> 18:39.777
I convinced Dr. Greer
to buy four more.

18:39.983 --> 18:42.548
- Really?
- At $500 apiece.

18:42.654 --> 18:45.607
That's two grand. That's more
than we need for the contractor.

18:45.821 --> 18:48.199
Yeah, but I was actually
thinking we could reinvest it.

18:48.301 --> 18:49.957
- In what?
- In you.

18:54.312 --> 18:56.848
<i>Marshall explained that
he was building a fancy new Web site</i>

18:56.951 --> 19:00.626
<i>specifically to sell
Lily's artwork to veterinarians.</i>

19:02.391 --> 19:05.638
Well, it's not exactly
the clientele I had in mind, but...

19:06.533 --> 19:08.769
thank you for believing in me.

19:14.291 --> 19:17.509
Man,
birds do not get you.

19:29.912 --> 19:30.919
Hi, sweetie.

19:31.024 --> 19:32.778
Hey, I think I left my tie here.
Have you seen it?

19:33.033 --> 19:35.570
No, I'm in wedding-planning mode.

19:35.824 --> 19:38.347
Stressville. Population: me.
Okay, big decision.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.848
What do you think the cake should be:
Fudgie the Whale or Cookie Puss?

19:42.643 --> 19:45.689
Yeah, that was a bit.
We were doing a bit.

19:46.144 --> 19:49.040
So I'm thinking Labor Day.
I was going to say Fourth of July,

19:49.145 --> 19:52.609
but I don't want to steal
any attention away from America.

19:54.513 --> 19:56.948
Abby, I've...
I've got some bad news.

19:58.124 --> 19:59.989
- I can't marry you.
- What?

20:00.344 --> 20:04.478
Ted begged me not to.
I think he's in love with you.

20:04.585 --> 20:07.240
- Really?
- Yes, our plan worked,

20:07.345 --> 20:09.629
better than we ever dreamed.
You have to go to him.

20:11.692 --> 20:13.928
Here's his home address.
But you know what? He works late,

20:14.035 --> 20:16.300
so I wouldn't go before
2:00 or 3:00 in the morning.

20:16.672 --> 20:20.560
Oh, my God, thank you.
But now I feel wrong keeping this.

20:20.665 --> 20:23.977
Oh, yeah, I wouldn't worry about that.
That's made of candy.

20:24.553 --> 20:25.408
Later.
