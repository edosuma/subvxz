00:09.009 --> 00:10.551
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:11.053 --> 00:12.679
Lift the bottom.

00:13.222 --> 00:15.431
FYI, he is in an awesome mood.

00:15.766 --> 00:17.183
He found out
you're going to those meetings.

00:17.267 --> 00:19.227
Well, what can l say?
lt works if you work it, right?

00:23.565 --> 00:26.734
l was doing so good.
And then, pow! Divorce.

00:27.069 --> 00:31.489
Pow! l wanna be chief. Pow! l wreck my foot.

00:32.199 --> 00:34.409
l'm not handing over
the First Lady visit without a fight.

00:34.493 --> 00:35.743
We got to get out in front of this.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.204
l scoured the budget and hired a temp.

00:38.414 --> 00:39.914
Don't eat him alive.

00:40.249 --> 00:42.417
My name's Kelly.
You're at All Saints. You're gonna be okay.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.585
Sorry if l muscled in on your gunshot.

00:45.921 --> 00:47.588
l didn't notice.

00:48.090 --> 00:49.882
Percocet. O'Hara's gunshot.

00:50.134 --> 00:53.344
Kelly picked it up, then came back,
swapped it out for Motrin.

02:12.466 --> 02:16.177
My heart's going really fast.
Can you check my pulse?

02:16.261 --> 02:18.262
Sure, sweetie. Come here.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.103
l'm sorry.

02:26.188 --> 02:28.439
Oh, honey, there's nothing to be sorry for.

02:28.941 --> 02:30.733
l'm glad you're here. You know why?

02:31.235 --> 02:32.318
Why?

02:32.778 --> 02:36.864
Because now we can have midnight cocoa.
How does that sound?

02:37.950 --> 02:39.450
lt's not midnight.

02:39.535 --> 02:43.037
Well, then we can have 2:00 a.m. cocoa.
That's even better.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.873
This one had her throat cut.

02:46.208 --> 02:51.754
This one was skinned alive.
And this one was rolled on hot coals.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.715
"Gruesome Saint Deaths."

02:55.217 --> 02:58.803
That's some pretty scary stuff, sweetie.
lt's no wonder you can't sleep.

02:58.887 --> 03:01.305
lt's not scary. lt's our religion.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.560
There are more than 1 0,000 saints.

03:05.727 --> 03:07.937
What if l choose
the wrong one for the pageant?

03:08.522 --> 03:09.564
May l?

03:12.734 --> 03:16.028
Pick a saint, any saint at all.

03:20.242 --> 03:22.159
l'm Saint Barbara.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.538
-What's so funny?
-Saint Barbara's a girl, Dad.

03:25.622 --> 03:27.748
Really? Shoot.

03:28.000 --> 03:29.750
Okay, my turn.

03:30.252 --> 03:32.336
There we go. This guy.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.756
Saint lsidore, patron saint of the lnternet?

03:36.508 --> 03:38.593
What? Who knew?

03:38.927 --> 03:40.511
All right, sweetie, your turn.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.179
No, thanks.

03:44.766 --> 03:46.684
l need to you to wake me up by 7:00.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.728
You want me to tuck you back in?

03:48.812 --> 03:50.313
l'm 1 1 , Mom.

03:50.397 --> 03:51.856
Yes, yes, you certainly are.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.691
7:00 a.m. it is.

03:53.817 --> 03:55.109
Don't forget.

03:55.277 --> 03:56.652
We got it.

04:01.408 --> 04:03.409
Hot coals.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.704
Fuck, l'm tired.

04:10.125 --> 04:12.627
You're a good mom. You know that?

04:14.296 --> 04:15.880
Yes, l do.

04:41.949 --> 04:45.076
l see you already have your morning fix.

04:47.245 --> 04:49.830
Two hundred bucks for five pills? Really?

04:51.416 --> 04:54.001
Supply and demand, babe.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.882
And you know l gave you six.

05:13.689 --> 05:15.690
Hey, Jackie. You're a friend of Bill's?

05:16.692 --> 05:18.818
l don't know what
or who you're talking about, Sam.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.945
That guy back in the diner
you were hugging.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.989
He's, like, the best sponsor in the world.

05:23.073 --> 05:25.491
-He's legendary.
-He's an epileptic l helped a long time ago.

05:25.575 --> 05:27.743
He is not a friend. l don't know him.
End of story.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.663
l'm sorry. l'm just jumping back into
the program, you know.

05:30.789 --> 05:33.791
Man, today this one chick told a story
about her boyfriend OD'ing.

05:33.917 --> 05:37.128
And she was so strung out.
She, like, stole the drugs off his dead body

05:37.212 --> 05:39.255
before she calls 91 1 .

05:39.339 --> 05:40.798
So fucking bleak.

05:41.717 --> 05:43.592
Hello.

05:43.969 --> 05:46.053
-Do you mind?
-No, not at all.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.179
lt's private.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.098
-l can wait.
-Sam, it's my husband.

05:49.182 --> 05:51.183
Oh, sorry.

06:02.404 --> 06:04.155
Jesus Christ.

06:15.083 --> 06:16.625
Are you meditating?

06:17.085 --> 06:22.256
Kind of. Word on the street is
Kelly Slater runs to work shirtless.

06:25.427 --> 06:27.720
l shall wait with you.

06:29.097 --> 06:34.101
That was fun last night, hanging with Kelly,
Peace Corps style.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.938
l can't believe he paid for everyone.
Who ever heard of a rich nurse?

06:38.106 --> 06:40.274
"Not l," said the fly.

06:40.859 --> 06:45.237
You know, l used to have a big problem
with him until last night

06:45.322 --> 06:48.949
when he paid for all my drinks
and a French onion soup.

06:49.326 --> 06:51.869
l saw Sean Penn in his contacts.

06:51.953 --> 06:56.040
Yeah. They hung in Haiti.
He told me all about it. They text.

06:56.458 --> 06:57.625
lncoming.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.297
Jackie.

07:04.508 --> 07:07.218
Ladies and gentlemen, on your left,
the original nurse without borders,

07:07.302 --> 07:09.261
5'1 0", 1 90 pounds.

07:09.429 --> 07:10.387
Not shirtless.

07:10.472 --> 07:11.555
Unfortunately.

07:11.640 --> 07:13.974
Mr. Kelly Slater!

07:14.059 --> 07:16.060
-And on the right, from...
-Queens.

07:16.353 --> 07:18.145
l know, but is that where she was born?

07:18.313 --> 07:21.107
Don't know. Probably. But maybe not.
Jackie's very private.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.817
Hi, Jackie.

07:23.026 --> 07:24.485
Wish you could have been there, Jackie.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.737
What can l say? l have a life.
Anybody want to work here?

07:26.822 --> 07:28.948
-Kelly told us about delivering a baby.
-ln a cave.

07:29.074 --> 07:30.241
That must have been dark.

07:30.325 --> 07:31.659
l had a bacon martini.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.246
-Delicious.
-lt was. Sort of. Not really.

07:40.544 --> 07:45.214
Mr. Slater, l can't tell you how happy we are
to have you with us here at All Saints.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.508
Well, thank you for saying so.

07:48.343 --> 07:52.179
l hadn't realized that you had been
at Bellevue at one point.

07:52.264 --> 07:55.474
Pediatric ER, really, really rewarding stuff.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.144
You must know my colleague, Lily Chung.

07:58.228 --> 08:00.813
Yeah, yeah. Tough lady. Smart, though.

08:03.358 --> 08:06.861
Yeah, well, l'd love to hear your thoughts

08:06.945 --> 08:09.488
on how All Saints
can better service the community,

08:09.573 --> 08:13.200
especially in relation
to childhood obesity issues.

08:13.368 --> 08:17.037
That's funny. Chung was a killer
when it came to kids' health.

08:17.205 --> 08:18.956
She did some really outstanding work with...

08:19.040 --> 08:21.834
Yes, Lily is a killer

08:23.545 --> 08:25.045
administrator.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.759
Yeah, well, she ran a tight ship over there.

08:30.844 --> 08:34.221
She leaned heavy
on the acronyms though, like, AlM.

08:34.639 --> 08:37.099
"Accountable, lmpeccable,
Meticulousness."

08:37.225 --> 08:38.976
Kind of a mouthful.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.315
That's a great shot of Mrs. O.

08:44.399 --> 08:47.151
You know, most people don't know
she's got a wicked sense of humor.

08:49.654 --> 08:50.905
You know the First Lady?

08:51.406 --> 08:54.325
You know, you kind of remind me of her.

08:54.618 --> 08:57.995
Well, to be honest, l don't know her.
My mother knows her.

08:58.079 --> 09:02.875
She's a judge.
But l did meet her once briefly.

09:03.210 --> 09:07.338
Briefly is good. Briefly is just fine.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.144
"Orchids and Salami"?

09:22.229 --> 09:25.606
Eva Gabor's memoir.
The two things she had in her fridge.

09:25.899 --> 09:28.108
Duck sauce and Marlboros.

09:28.276 --> 09:29.985
Let me guess, your fridge?

09:30.237 --> 09:34.114
Lenny's. How do you spell "camaraderie"?

09:34.324 --> 09:36.909
-C-O-M-A?
-That's "coma."

09:37.160 --> 09:38.369
Am l in your blog?

09:38.662 --> 09:40.746
-Maybe.
-Cool.

09:41.289 --> 09:42.623
What about me?

09:42.707 --> 09:45.793
l've changed the names
to protect the innocent.

09:46.169 --> 09:47.294
lnnocent?

09:47.379 --> 09:48.462
What about me?

09:49.673 --> 09:51.173
You guys, it's anonymous.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.300
Fine. Can l be called "Joaquin"?

09:54.052 --> 09:56.595
Right. Like l can spell that.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.098
Zoey, l need you to stop whatever
it is you're doing and get to urology.

09:59.182 --> 10:00.307
Stopping.

10:00.392 --> 10:03.227
Jacks, are you available after work today?

10:03.728 --> 10:06.730
-Why? What do you got?
-Another ghastly open house.

10:06.815 --> 10:09.066
Champagne, grabby Russians.
Really unpleasant.

10:09.150 --> 10:10.734
So much more fun if you've got a friend.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.238
Wow, l would really love to,
but l should get straight home.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.906
You know, Kevin...

10:16.283 --> 10:17.866
ls he still treating you like an inmate?

10:17.993 --> 10:20.202
Yeah. To say the very least. Next time?

10:21.413 --> 10:22.788
Sure.

10:22.998 --> 10:24.999
l'll go if you want.

10:28.003 --> 10:31.588
By the way, blog without an "L", bog.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.550
-That means "toilet."
-Precisely.

10:34.759 --> 10:37.303
Female, 35. Kid called it in.

10:37.387 --> 10:40.180
Observed shallow breathing,
non-responsive.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.600
Hi, there. What's your name?

10:44.102 --> 10:46.353
-Walker.
-ls that your mom, Walker?

10:46.521 --> 10:48.814
Okay, you wait right here.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.485
On my count. One, two, three!

10:54.571 --> 10:56.530
Sat is low. She's aspirated.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.532
Kid said they went to a concert last night.

10:58.616 --> 11:00.159
This morning, Mom didn't wake up.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.910
We can't pump her stomach.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.872
Nothing like getting trashed
with your 1 2-year-old.

11:05.123 --> 11:08.584
Buddy. Do you want us to call
somebody for you? Maybe your dad?

11:08.668 --> 11:10.127
That's funny.

11:10.337 --> 11:11.337
How are you doing?

11:11.421 --> 11:12.880
How's my mom?

11:13.340 --> 11:16.508
lt's gonna be a little while.
Why don't you come with me?

11:17.469 --> 11:20.637
Zoey, Zoey, can you take Walker
to the cafeteria, please?

11:20.722 --> 11:22.264
Why don't you get some breakfast, sweetie?

11:22.390 --> 11:23.432
Follow me.

11:29.272 --> 11:30.814
You smoke?

11:30.899 --> 11:32.149
l do not.

11:34.527 --> 11:39.073
But l do have this weird gum
that l get in Chinatown.

11:39.157 --> 11:40.157
lt's black.

11:40.241 --> 11:41.533
Cool.

11:43.244 --> 11:46.121
l asked you to wake me up at 7:00.
We get marked down if we're late.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.625
l'm sorry, Gracie, but as you know,
we were up pretty late last night.

11:50.085 --> 11:54.213
Aunt Tunie sleeps late, too.
She says it's good for her skin.

11:56.091 --> 11:58.801
-My saints! Dad.
-l didn't do it.

11:58.885 --> 12:00.761
lt's fine. l'll pick them up for you.

12:01.596 --> 12:05.849
-l worked so hard. There's 87.
-lt's okay. l'll find them for you, honey.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.727
Come on, it's okay. Let's go in.

12:11.439 --> 12:15.317
Check everywhere, Dad.
Everywhere. Look in between the seats.

12:15.485 --> 12:17.528
-You have to find all of them.
-lt's okay.

12:17.612 --> 12:21.532
Every single one. l promise, okay?
Have a good day.

13:41.779 --> 13:44.406
Haven't seen my dad since l was 1 1 .

13:45.617 --> 13:46.950
Where's he live?

13:47.035 --> 13:48.243
Jersey.

13:53.416 --> 13:55.209
My dad's in prison.

13:58.755 --> 14:00.130
This a good hospital?

14:00.215 --> 14:01.256
Yes.

14:03.468 --> 14:05.302
l mean, in what way?

14:05.386 --> 14:08.639
ln the "is my mom gonna die" way?

14:08.723 --> 14:10.349
lt's a good hospital.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.395
l smoked menthols when l was your age.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.231
-Gross.
-l know.

14:25.156 --> 14:27.241
Now, we're gonna need to flush this.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.326
lt must have been some kite.

14:29.410 --> 14:32.412
A regular kite. Just flying it 60 stories up.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.747
You on a roof or something?

14:33.831 --> 14:37.459
34th and 8th.
l'm an ironworker, fourth generation.

14:37.627 --> 14:39.962
We fly kites at lunch. lt breaks up the day.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.214
The wind's pretty fierce up there.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.091
Yes, l can see that.

14:44.717 --> 14:45.968
Higher the better, you know?

14:46.427 --> 14:48.887
You won't get an argument out of me.

14:48.972 --> 14:51.265
Actually, that's not true.
l'm terrified of heights.

14:51.349 --> 14:52.474
Yeah, me too.

14:52.892 --> 14:54.601
What are you doing
working on top of a building?

14:54.894 --> 14:57.896
Kind of like a family business, l guess.
l'm Mohawk.

14:59.107 --> 15:02.442
Everyone thinks lndians
aren't afraid of heights. Total bullshit.

15:02.694 --> 15:05.112
-Really?
-We're just as scared as the next guy.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.322
We just hold it differently.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.408
What does that mean?

15:09.576 --> 15:13.203
Well, fear is danger, right?

15:13.288 --> 15:16.039
And danger, when you think about it,
is kind of exhilarating.

15:16.124 --> 15:19.668
So, you know, pretty much like that.

15:22.338 --> 15:25.465
Okay, you sit tight for a minute.

15:35.685 --> 15:38.478
Can't believe my moms made me
clean out my room.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.652
Millennium Falcon.

15:46.279 --> 15:48.780
-You know it?
-Know it?

15:48.948 --> 15:52.993
l had Chewbacca sheets
and l turned my sandbox into Tatooine.

15:55.038 --> 15:57.122
Are we really back to
you not answering your page...

15:57.206 --> 15:59.499
What the fuck? You're encouraging him?

15:59.792 --> 16:01.376
Princess Leia out.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.841
Please don't yell at me.

16:11.679 --> 16:14.222
All right, you're having a hard day. l can tell.

16:17.060 --> 16:19.353
You know what l think might help?

16:19.520 --> 16:20.520
lce cream?

16:21.230 --> 16:25.692
No. No, Coop, not ice cream.
How about a really interesting patient?

16:26.736 --> 16:28.528
How interesting?

16:28.780 --> 16:30.322
An ironworker.

16:32.408 --> 16:34.117
-An lndian?
-Yes.

16:37.288 --> 16:40.749
l saw it on the Discovery Channel.
What room is he in?

16:40.833 --> 16:43.752
He's in Exam 1 .

16:46.631 --> 16:48.423
Joseph, this is Dr. Cooper.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.384
l heard we had a wind walker in our midst.

16:50.468 --> 16:52.678
That's not what l said.

16:52.845 --> 16:54.429
Actually we call it "walking iron."

16:54.514 --> 16:57.391
Right, right.
You're the guys who aren't afraid of heights.

16:57.642 --> 17:01.645
That is so badass.
Excuse me while l kiss this guy.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.651
Dr. Cooper, the eye.

17:11.572 --> 17:13.699
You guys built most of Manhattan, right?

17:14.701 --> 17:18.245
Yeah. l mean,
my grandfather built the Chrysler Building.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.622
My dad did the World Trade, so...

17:20.707 --> 17:22.082
Dude, how's your lungs?

17:22.166 --> 17:24.126
Yeah, yeah, they're fine.

17:24.210 --> 17:27.629
These guys helped out huge on the cleanup.
Rough on the lungs. Four by four.

17:29.549 --> 17:31.258
Must be nice.

17:31.843 --> 17:37.806
All those dads working together,
building things, family.

17:38.766 --> 17:40.350
You want to talk about fear?

17:40.601 --> 17:43.895
Try having two moms who decide
out of the blue, without warning,

17:43.980 --> 17:47.607
to essentially destroy the family unit,
rip it in half.

17:50.194 --> 17:52.738
Jackie, Dr. O'Hara needs you.
lt's about the kid.

17:53.114 --> 17:56.491
l have to drive upstate this afternoon.
My daughter's in a school play.

17:56.576 --> 17:57.868
Yeah, dude, check it out.

17:58.119 --> 18:01.788
l lived in a teepee in my room
my entire fourth grade.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.292
Probably wanna stick to some short-acting
painkillers, if you're gonna be driving later.

18:05.376 --> 18:08.128
Yes, Slates, l got this.
Definitely gonna go easy on the drugs.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.464
-Vicodin, probably.
-Yes, Vicodin.

18:10.548 --> 18:12.174
l'll call it in. Why don't you go grab that?

18:15.720 --> 18:18.305
lt was more like a pup tent, actually.

18:18.389 --> 18:22.392
Safe to say she won't be receiving
"Mother of the Year" award anytime soon.

18:23.603 --> 18:29.149
Marijuana, methadone, methamphetamine,
hydrocodeine? Good Lord.

18:30.026 --> 18:33.195
And a shitload of booze.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.573
l'll go tell the kid.

18:44.832 --> 18:48.460
l told him he could hang in here
until his dad comes.

18:49.212 --> 18:51.338
l can't believe his mom did that.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.007
We don't know the circumstances, Zoey.

18:54.467 --> 18:56.468
Stay out of it.

19:00.598 --> 19:02.349
Hello.

19:03.017 --> 19:05.435
ls this supposed to be a church
or something?

19:05.812 --> 19:07.521
Yes, something like that.

19:08.231 --> 19:09.523
l'm an atheist.

19:12.068 --> 19:14.402
lt's a good thing you called this in.
You know that, right?

19:16.322 --> 19:18.907
l kept telling her the only thing she needed
is Xanax.

19:30.044 --> 19:32.504
Well, your mom's gonna be okay.
She's on a ventilator.

19:33.172 --> 19:35.465
They're moving her up to lCU.

19:36.050 --> 19:38.885
She'll probably be able to come home
in a few days.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.139
Pretty sure she's a drug addict.

19:49.564 --> 19:52.107
You know, being a mom is not an easy job.

19:52.483 --> 19:55.527
-lt's one of the hardest things in the...
-She's a fucking drug addict, okay?

19:58.614 --> 20:00.407
Whatever.

20:02.118 --> 20:03.869
lt's her life.

20:15.172 --> 20:16.673
GERBlL.

20:16.757 --> 20:21.803
"Great Excellence Reached
By lnspired Listening." GERBlL.

20:23.014 --> 20:27.559
LlLY. "Loitering ls Losing." Yes.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.060
Almost there.

20:29.312 --> 20:33.356
TlT. "Teach lnstead of Talk." TlT.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.317
That's not gonna work.

20:35.401 --> 20:37.944
Sure l've got 'em,
but what are you gonna do for me?

20:38.029 --> 20:40.447
You still owe me shit from two weeks ago.

20:41.699 --> 20:45.035
Listen, you guys are cancer,
a bunch of miscommunicating cells.

20:45.119 --> 20:47.454
l've got chemistry over here, okay?

20:47.747 --> 20:52.208
Delightful, well-behaved, healing molecules.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.669
Yeah, all right.

20:55.338 --> 20:56.880
l'll call you back.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.134
Everybody's always after me
for my fentanyl patches.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.429
We would've killed for those in Haiti.
Unbelievable for pain.

21:04.513 --> 21:09.976
Yep, 1 00 times stronger than morphine,
not fucking around.

21:11.145 --> 21:12.437
Coop called it in.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.564
And you feel like doing me a favor

21:14.649 --> 21:16.816
and bringing this up to
the thieves in oncology for me?

21:16.901 --> 21:18.276
Sure, no problem.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.362
Appreciate it.

21:21.656 --> 21:23.698
-Whoa.
-Sorry, Doc.

21:26.077 --> 21:27.953
Excuse me?

21:28.329 --> 21:30.121
Where do you keep
your prosthetic adhesive?

21:32.667 --> 21:34.334
What's the matter? Your leg falling off?

21:34.627 --> 21:39.297
No, l've got a viewing at the St. Regis
after work and my heel's about to give way,

21:40.216 --> 21:42.384
not that it's any of your business.

21:43.427 --> 21:47.263
lf l see one more
"ultimate penthouse with soaring views..."

21:47.515 --> 21:50.225
Yeah, l wish l had those problems.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.103
Yes, well, maybe you
and your Jameson's would care to join me.

21:53.896 --> 21:55.563
Jackie turned you down, huh?

21:55.940 --> 21:57.565
She's not as available as she used to be.

21:58.985 --> 22:00.986
Tell me about it.

22:01.529 --> 22:02.988
How about we take my bike?

22:03.364 --> 22:04.823
How about we take my car?

22:05.116 --> 22:08.410
No, no, no, it's great.
l ask for Saturday off and they give it to me.

22:08.494 --> 22:09.744
Gotta go.

22:10.371 --> 22:12.580
Drinks out with the gang last night,
Saturday off.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.958
You are one popular guy.
You should run for class president.

22:15.042 --> 22:18.420
Yeah, that'd be great if l could only
figure out where the fuck oncology is.

22:18.713 --> 22:20.797
Pharmacy guy asked me
to bring this up to them.

22:20.881 --> 22:23.133
l'll tell you what.
You go change my catheter in six,

22:23.217 --> 22:25.385
l'll bring this up to oncology
for pharmacy guy.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.053
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

22:42.236 --> 22:43.528
What is that?

22:46.115 --> 22:48.742
Bought it on the street.
lt's supposed to be soothing.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.620
-How can l help you?
-You gave Kelly Saturday off? Really?

22:52.705 --> 22:53.997
That's bullshit.

22:54.081 --> 22:56.041
l'm sorry you feel that way.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.168
And what is with the acronyms?

22:59.086 --> 23:00.628
l'm trying something new.

23:02.256 --> 23:04.674
All l'm saying is that
Kelly's been here a week.

23:04.759 --> 23:06.509
l've been here a million years.

23:06.594 --> 23:10.346
Thor's been here four.
Sam and Zoey have been here one.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.723
This is gonna crush morale.

23:11.974 --> 23:16.061
l'm sorry, Jackie. l think Mr. Slater
has done wonders for morale.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.855
He took the entire nursing staff out
for drinks last night.

23:18.939 --> 23:20.106
Yes, l know all about it.

23:20.608 --> 23:23.359
The fact is Kelly Slater is a winner.

23:24.111 --> 23:25.153
What's that supposed to mean?

23:25.696 --> 23:27.113
He met the First Lady.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.115
ls this about the fat kids?

23:30.367 --> 23:31.367
Bunion?

23:34.914 --> 23:37.999
lt's like you see right through me.

23:38.667 --> 23:43.463
lt was a bunion. But the bunion is no more.

23:43.923 --> 23:46.049
Had one last year, it killed.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.176
Moccasins.

23:50.096 --> 23:52.263
Sorry about your moms. Sucks.

23:52.807 --> 23:55.141
Yeah, thanks.

24:04.318 --> 24:05.401
Are you good?

24:06.278 --> 24:07.320
l think so.

24:08.155 --> 24:09.989
Don't forget your kite.

24:14.036 --> 24:15.995
-Keep it.
-Seriously?

24:17.581 --> 24:20.542
Thanks, chief. l mean, no. l didn't...

24:20.626 --> 24:22.919
l mean, damn it. l call everyone chief.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.671
l might soon be chief.

24:36.517 --> 24:40.854
Jackie, check it out. He gave it to me.
We had a connection.

24:42.022 --> 24:44.983
Against the wind, you moron!

24:47.361 --> 24:50.321
You'll never get this high!

24:53.200 --> 24:56.744
Check out pharmacy guy.
l would have never put those two together.

25:02.960 --> 25:04.836
Yeah, neither would l.

25:14.680 --> 25:17.891
l am fearless!

25:20.728 --> 25:22.061
Oh, crap.

25:31.405 --> 25:32.405
Think fast.

25:36.535 --> 25:38.119
Cleaned out the car.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.997
Fucking dental floss?

25:41.248 --> 25:43.708
-Kevin, hold on one second, okay?
-Are you fucking out of your mind?

25:43.792 --> 25:47.462
Kevin, this is old, okay?
This is from when we went on the...

25:47.546 --> 25:49.797
God! Kevin,
it's from when we went on the trip in the car.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.341
ln the fucking car, Jackie?

25:51.425 --> 25:52.425
-Kevin...
-What if one of the girls...

25:52.509 --> 25:54.093
-Will you let me explain, please?
-What do l have to do,

25:54.178 --> 25:55.511
toss the whole house?

25:55.596 --> 25:57.847
Kevin, this is old. This is not from now.

25:57.932 --> 26:01.351
This is from a long time ago
when we took the trip in the car.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.061
l am so sorry you found it.

26:03.145 --> 26:05.396
That must have been...
Must've been awful for you.

26:10.319 --> 26:11.319
You have to believe me, Kevin.

26:11.403 --> 26:13.738
l swear to God.
l don't know what to do to convince you.

26:13.822 --> 26:17.492
And l was starting to feel like
it might be okay again.

26:24.500 --> 26:26.125
Here. Okay? Thirty days clean.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.505
Kevin, l know how dangerous
this shit is, okay?

26:31.465 --> 26:35.218
This morning, just this morning
at a meeting, at my meeting, okay, Kevin?

26:35.302 --> 26:39.264
At my meeting, l heard a story about
a woman whose boyfriend OD'd.

26:39.348 --> 26:43.142
She stole the drugs off his body
before she called 91 1 .

26:43.644 --> 26:45.436
lt's so fucking bleak.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.489
We are okay, Kevin. lt is okay.

26:57.032 --> 26:59.117
lt is okay. We're okay.
