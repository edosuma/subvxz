00:55.422 --> 00:58.991
♪

00:55.422 --> 00:58.991
Ah! Alright, it's not going anywhere!

00:58.993 --> 01:02.194
Go ahead.

01:28.488 --> 01:31.323
So soft...

01:31.325 --> 01:34.293
Oh, sweet mother of--! Sorry.

01:36.129 --> 01:40.065
I didn't know you were real.
I'm George Crabtree.
What's your name?

01:42.001 --> 01:45.871
(applause)

01:45.873 --> 01:49.208
Yes. Very good.

01:50.310 --> 01:52.678
Attention all!
Proceed to your seats.

01:52.680 --> 01:55.647
The great Captain Joseph Bernier
is about to take the stage

01:55.649 --> 01:57.916
for today's lecture.

02:01.054 --> 02:04.356
Where the Swedes
and Yankees have failed,

02:04.358 --> 02:06.725
I shall succeed.

02:08.361 --> 02:12.498
Sorry, these seats are taken.
I shall make my mark!

02:12.500 --> 02:16.869
A mark for Canada.
I will be the first man

02:16.871 --> 02:21.406
to set foot on the North Pole!
(applause)

02:21.408 --> 02:24.843
Thank you.

02:24.845 --> 02:28.213
Have we missed much, George?
Just the exhibition part, sir,

02:28.215 --> 02:32.017
and a chunk of the lecture.
I see you brought young Roland.

02:32.019 --> 02:35.387
We are determined to live our
lives as we otherwise would.

02:35.389 --> 02:38.423
Modern parents in a modern age.

02:38.425 --> 02:41.693
...to purchase a new ship.
And I ask

02:41.695 --> 02:46.865
that you consider contributing
to this daring effort as well.

02:46.867 --> 02:50.869
Shall we make a small
contribution?
If you like.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.372
That way Roland will
grow up in a Canada

02:53.374 --> 02:55.974
whose boundaries extend
all the way to the North Pole.

02:57.310 --> 03:01.847
The heart and soul of any
expedition starts with her crew.

03:01.849 --> 03:05.651
(Roland fussing)
And I have the best in the world.

03:05.653 --> 03:09.121
The CGS Arctic.

03:09.123 --> 03:12.257
The best vessel money can buy.

03:12.259 --> 03:18.096
Her first journey will test her
resolve as much as it will mine.
I'm sorry.

03:18.098 --> 03:22.401
He's becoming restless. I should
walk him around outside.

03:22.403 --> 03:26.071
Julia, I can take him.
No, William, stay.

03:26.073 --> 03:29.575
I'll be fine.
The Inuit, or Eskimo
as you know them, taught us

03:29.577 --> 03:32.911
how to use them
for ice travel.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.414
Mr. Blair.

03:35.416 --> 03:38.250
(audience murmuring)
Take that off! Take that off!

03:38.252 --> 03:40.686
I'm sorry,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:40.688 --> 03:43.222
I apologize for that fright.

03:43.224 --> 03:47.226
(audience gasping)
Another slide,  Mr. Blair, please.

03:50.430 --> 03:53.465
What are you doing, Blair?

03:53.467 --> 03:56.501
Mais qu'est-ce que vous faites?
<i>Vous voulez bousiller ma</i>
<i>présentation, c'est ça?</i>

03:56.503 --> 03:58.971
I'm talking about
the future of Canada!

03:58.973 --> 04:02.241
<i>Est-ce que vous comprenez?</i>
<i>L'avenir du Canada!</i>

04:02.243 --> 04:04.643
<i>Sir,</i> is this a part
of the presentation?

04:06.312 --> 04:09.881
I really don't
think so, George.

04:17.457 --> 04:22.160
Can't you see this?
Someone is trying to sabotage
my grand expedition!

04:22.162 --> 04:26.298
Well, that may be so--
They want my funding
withdrawn, my ship taken away!

04:26.300 --> 04:30.302
To put an end to this!
The fate of Canada is at stake!

04:30.304 --> 04:33.405
Mr. Bernier, you yourself
admit the man died
in your charge--

04:33.407 --> 04:36.308
Men die all the time
on such expeditions!

04:36.310 --> 04:38.810
Entire crews perish!

04:38.812 --> 04:41.413
Do you know of Sir John
Franklin's journey?

04:41.415 --> 04:45.817
Of course. Yet in this case,
someone believes you
personally responsible.

04:45.819 --> 04:49.821
<i>Sottises!</i>
<i>Before I investigate the</i>
<i>sabotage of your presentation,</i>

04:49.823 --> 04:52.658
I must first determine the
validity of their claims.

04:52.660 --> 04:56.395
Comment osez-vous insinuer
une chose pareille?
Vous êtes idiot ou quoi?

04:56.397 --> 05:00.299
Le plus tôt vous coopérez avec
<i>cet idiot, le plus tôt vous</i>
<i>serez lavé de tout soupçon.</i>

05:00.301 --> 05:05.070
Well... maybe you'd care
to see the body?

05:05.072 --> 05:08.373
You have the body?
Yeah. At the local
funeral home.

05:08.375 --> 05:12.444
I understand you are a member
of Captain Bernier's crew?

05:14.380 --> 05:17.015
Yes, I am his photographer.

05:17.017 --> 05:20.652
I also took some moving pictures
of this most recent expedition.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.088
The ones in the nickelodeon?
Yes.

05:23.090 --> 05:25.991
I quite liked that.
Thank you.

05:25.993 --> 05:30.228
Did you take the photograph
of the dead man?
Shortly after he was found.

05:30.230 --> 05:34.099
And as projectionist of this
slide show, I'm assuming you
arranged the photographs.

05:34.101 --> 05:37.102
Yes, but I surely
did not put in

05:37.104 --> 05:39.738
the ones accusing
Captain Bernier of murder.

05:39.740 --> 05:42.607
His name was Arthur Pimblett.

05:42.609 --> 05:46.144
A dear friend who was at my side
in all my expeditions.

05:46.146 --> 05:49.481
A man of science and nature,

05:49.483 --> 05:54.419
he served as my navigator
or doctor. I will miss him.

05:54.421 --> 05:58.423
How did he die?
Whenever the ship
was stationary,

05:58.425 --> 06:01.560
Arthur explored
the surrounding areas.

06:01.562 --> 06:04.062
He dreamed
of discovering

06:04.064 --> 06:07.366
new species of wildlife,
you know?

06:07.368 --> 06:11.236
But he never returned
from that fateful walk.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.238
He got lost.
Yeah.

06:13.240 --> 06:17.776
Maybe he suffered from snow
blindness, and froze to death.

06:17.778 --> 06:21.780
How long after his
disappearance was he found?
Four days.

06:21.782 --> 06:25.083
The search cost me
valuable time.

06:25.085 --> 06:29.054
I had to turn back or risk
running out of provisions.

06:29.056 --> 06:33.725
I'm told you have the body.
Yes, such as it is.

06:33.727 --> 06:37.162
Decomposition must be
quite advanced at this point.

06:37.164 --> 06:39.264
Arthur died
three months ago.

06:39.266 --> 06:42.834
I preserved him the best
I could using salt,

06:42.836 --> 06:47.606
but I'm afraid he's not cutting
as fine a figure as he once did.
Well, I eagerly await

06:47.608 --> 06:50.342
his arrival at
the city morgue. Gentlemen.

06:51.811 --> 06:54.579
Bye.

06:56.849 --> 06:59.117
Well, I do hope

06:59.119 --> 07:03.288
she's a better Coroner
than she is a mother.
I beg your pardon?

07:03.290 --> 07:06.958
She hardly knows
how to hold a baby!
Oh, well, I--

07:08.895 --> 07:13.165
Not fit for motherhood
anyway. Too skinny.

07:13.167 --> 07:18.136
Monsieur Bernier--
My wife has meat on the bones.

07:18.138 --> 07:22.774
I like to know she'll survive an
angry winter while I'm away.
(chuckling)

07:22.776 --> 07:26.011
Monsieur Bernier,
the Coroner is my wife.

07:26.013 --> 07:29.381
Oh. To each his own.

07:32.051 --> 07:34.519
Who might wish to suggest
that Mr. Pimblett's death

07:34.521 --> 07:38.523
was your doing?
Who else? The Swedes!

07:38.525 --> 07:42.260
Bjorn Nordenskjold.

07:42.262 --> 07:46.798
He wants nothing more than
to beat me to the North Pole.
That's why he's in Toronto.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.669
I see your slide show
did not go so well,

07:50.671 --> 07:54.840
Mr. Bernier. I hope
you don't lose your ship!

07:54.842 --> 07:57.509
What of sending your men

07:57.511 --> 07:59.911
to the North Pole
in a hydrogen balloon?

07:59.913 --> 08:04.382
It was six years ago and still
no return. Can we assume

08:04.384 --> 08:08.353
that was a failure?!
(speaking Swedish)

08:08.355 --> 08:11.022
Je suis le plus grand
explorateur au monde!

08:11.024 --> 08:13.391
Vous aviez pas d'affaire
à vous montrer la face
dans ma présentation!

08:13.393 --> 08:16.828
(speaking Swedish)
<i>Le pôle Nord appartient</i>
<i>au Canada!</i>

08:16.830 --> 08:19.231
I see.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.269
Decomposition
was indeed advanced.

08:24.271 --> 08:27.839
Coupled with the salt used
to preserve it, the body
became dry and shriveled.

08:27.841 --> 08:31.309
Mummified, if you will.
I see you've given him a bath.

08:31.311 --> 08:34.212
I'm hoping this Sodium
Hydroxide mixture

08:34.214 --> 08:37.048
will re-hydrate the body
near to its original form.

08:37.050 --> 08:40.986
Very resourceful, Julia. Have
you tried this before?
No.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.722
But if it works,
I should be able to provide

08:43.724 --> 08:47.292
a more complete picture of the
circumstances he died under.
Well then,

08:47.294 --> 08:51.396
I shall await the results
of Mr. Pimblett's bath.
Or I could tell you

08:51.398 --> 08:54.132
the cause of the death right now?
You can?

08:54.134 --> 08:57.669
(telephone ringing)
He may well have wandered off
the ship as Mr. Bernier claims,

08:57.671 --> 09:00.972
but I don't believe
hypothermia killed him.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.642
He was throttled, William.

09:03.644 --> 09:07.612
My preliminary examination revealed
fractures of the hyoid bone

09:07.614 --> 09:12.350
and surrounding cartilage.
Strangled.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.986
By ligature or manually?
I can't say.

09:14.988 --> 09:18.557
There's too much discolouration
of the skin to discern bruising patterns.

09:18.559 --> 09:23.295
Either way, this man's death
was no accident.
(metallic clanging)

09:25.231 --> 09:29.234
I tried to keep him away.
It's not your fault, Miss James.

09:29.236 --> 09:32.137
The Detective and I were distracted.

09:32.139 --> 09:36.207
If you don't mind my saying,
perhaps the Morgue isn't the
safest place for a baby.

09:39.145 --> 09:42.380
You should take him for a
while, while I continue here.

09:53.359 --> 09:57.395
Strangled? <i>Ce n'est pas</i>
<i>possible.</i> It's impossible.

09:57.397 --> 10:00.699
Arthur Pimblett was murdered, Captain Bernier.

10:00.701 --> 10:05.070
I'm afraid to say.
You claim to have
no knowledge of this?

10:05.072 --> 10:08.340
I won't dignify
such a question.

10:08.342 --> 10:12.310
Why don't you elaborate on
the circumstances surrounding
his disappearance, Captain?

10:12.312 --> 10:14.679
Like I mentioned,

10:14.681 --> 10:17.482
Arthur went on a walk
and never came back.

10:17.484 --> 10:21.953
My crew fanned out looking for
him, but it was too late.
(crying)

10:21.955 --> 10:24.022
Who found him?

10:24.024 --> 10:28.393
An Inuit crew member,
Nuniq. Carried him

10:28.395 --> 10:31.563
three miles back to the boat.

10:31.565 --> 10:35.533
Would he have had any reason
to want Mr. Pimblett dead?
Oh! Heavens no!

10:35.535 --> 10:38.436
Arthur was closer
to Nuniq than any of us.

10:38.438 --> 10:42.307
It was Arthur's idea
to assimilate an Inuit
into our crew.

10:42.309 --> 10:45.543
You're from Quebec, Captain.
What brings you to Toronto?

10:45.545 --> 10:50.015
This is where Arthur was born
and deserved to be buried.

10:50.017 --> 10:53.451
And I also hope to find
his replacement here.

10:53.453 --> 10:56.521
(baby fussing)
All the while  asking the public

10:56.523 --> 11:00.659
to fund your next expedition.
Well, Captain. If we have
any further questions...

11:00.661 --> 11:04.062
Of course.
Of course, Inspector.

11:04.064 --> 11:08.366
Oh, um, if I had any involvement

11:08.368 --> 11:11.736
in Arthur's murder, do you think

11:11.738 --> 11:16.074
I would have volunteered his body to you?
Well, you did

11:16.076 --> 11:20.078
express a lack of confidence
in our Coroner's abilities.

11:20.080 --> 11:24.215
Well, thank you, Captain.
I'll show you out.

11:27.720 --> 11:30.889
You seem to have a bee in your
bonnet about the Captain.
And you seem

11:30.891 --> 11:34.693
to quite like him, sir,
which I find surprising given
how you feel about Frenchmen.

11:34.695 --> 11:38.063
Well, he's not
a Frenchman Frenchman.
He's a Canadian Frenchman.

11:38.065 --> 11:42.133
And if he claims the North Pole
for Canada, he's also claiming
it for the British Empire.

11:42.135 --> 11:46.938
Right.
Oh, bloody hell, Murdoch,
give him here. Come on, Roland,

11:46.940 --> 11:51.242
little fella. Whoa!
(laughing)

11:51.244 --> 11:54.512
Have you not you heard
of a nanny, Murdoch?

11:54.514 --> 11:58.450
Get him on your knee
and bounce him.

11:58.452 --> 12:01.920
Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo!

12:01.922 --> 12:05.523
That's working, sir.
Yes.

12:09.528 --> 12:12.864
Right. I'll get Crabtree
to interview Bernier's crew,

12:12.866 --> 12:16.601
see if they can
corroborate his story.

12:18.537 --> 12:22.440
I can't go anywhere, sir,
or do anything.

12:22.442 --> 12:25.443
Just this...

12:25.445 --> 12:28.546
Welcome to fatherhood,
Murdoch.

12:34.487 --> 12:37.856
Strangled? Who would
do such a thing?
That's exactly

12:37.858 --> 12:41.493
what we're trying to ascertain,
Mr. Philips. What exactly
was your duty

12:41.495 --> 12:45.196
on Captain Bernier's expedition?
Third Officer, technically.
Though of course

12:45.198 --> 12:48.833
I'm much more than that.
How so?
Captain's protégé.

12:48.835 --> 12:51.970
I'm being groomed as his
successor. In me, he sees

12:51.972 --> 12:54.572
the same qualities that made him
a captain by the age of twenty.

12:54.574 --> 12:58.877
I'll have my
own ship before long.
Best of luck with that.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.913
I certainly won't be
under someone else's
command in my thirties.

13:01.915 --> 13:05.016
No, heaven forbid.
Can you explain to me

13:05.018 --> 13:07.185
the circumstances around
Mr. Pimblett's death?

13:07.187 --> 13:09.788
Derek Frewen, First Officer
of the CGS Arctic.

13:09.790 --> 13:12.390
What's going on here?
Perhaps you could help.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.393
He said Arthur was
strangled to death.
That can't be.

13:15.395 --> 13:18.029
He froze to death. Nuniq found
his body four days later

13:18.031 --> 13:20.498
and returned it to the ship.
Bernier yelled at him
when he did.

13:20.500 --> 13:24.269
Not sure for what,
but it was damn funny.
Captain Bernier

13:24.271 --> 13:27.272
was very upset over the death
of his dear friend.

13:30.910 --> 13:33.211
Thank you, gentlemen.

13:35.147 --> 13:39.717
Mr. Nuniq, may I have a word?
Yes, I am Nuniq.

13:39.719 --> 13:43.688
I understand that you
discovered Mr. Pimblett's body
and brought it back to the ship.

13:43.690 --> 13:45.890
Yes. Sad day.

13:45.892 --> 13:48.593
And that when you arrived
back at the ship,

13:48.595 --> 13:51.763
Captain Bernier yelled at you.
Can you tell me why?

13:51.765 --> 13:54.499
I say Arthur not
have gloves on,

13:54.501 --> 13:58.269
but Arthur always wear gloves
when exploring off ship.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.705
What exactly
did he yell at you?

14:00.707 --> 14:04.275
He say not my concern.
Right.

14:04.277 --> 14:09.247
Well, thank you, Mr. Nuniq.
Just Nuniq. No Mister.
Nuniq.

14:09.249 --> 14:12.750
Are you enjoying Toronto, Nuniq?
Yes,

14:12.752 --> 14:15.086
my people would not believe.
Oh, I daresay!

14:15.088 --> 14:19.858
It's a city of almost
a quarter of a million people.
I should show you around.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.293
Vast improvement.

14:22.295 --> 14:25.630
I wish Roland took to baths
with such ease.

14:25.632 --> 14:29.000
He puts up a fuss?
Always,

14:29.002 --> 14:32.337
but then maybe
I'm not doing it right?

14:32.339 --> 14:36.908
I question how well suited I am
to the tasks of motherhood.

14:36.910 --> 14:40.545
Well, maybe--
Miss James, come look at this.

14:45.584 --> 14:48.653
Sir, the crew seemed
genuinely surprised to hear

14:48.655 --> 14:52.590
that he'd been strangled,
yet I still get the sense
they're hiding something.

14:52.592 --> 14:56.261
Did you speak with the Inuit
fellow who found the body?

14:56.263 --> 14:59.931
Yes sir, Nuniq. He mentioned
that when he happened

14:59.933 --> 15:02.634
upon the body, Pimblett
was without gloves,

15:02.636 --> 15:05.370
which obviously was unusual
due to the cold weather.

15:05.372 --> 15:09.274
As if he had been forced off
the ship against his will.

15:09.276 --> 15:12.343
Did Mr. Nuniq--
Just Nuniq, sir. No Mister.

15:12.345 --> 15:14.579
Did Nuniq report

15:14.581 --> 15:17.115
the inconsistency
to Captain Bernier?
He did, sir, and apparently

15:17.117 --> 15:21.019
Captain Bernier tore a strip off
him for making mention of it.
William! You'll not believe--

15:21.021 --> 15:24.589
Shh!
(Roland crying)

15:24.591 --> 15:27.659
We're trying to get him
to sleep, Julia.

15:27.661 --> 15:31.829
I'm sorry.
It's alright, it's alright.

15:31.831 --> 15:36.401
When I took Mr. Pimblett out--
Well, there's no point
whispering now, Doctor.

15:37.736 --> 15:41.539
Right.
You were saying, Julia?

15:41.541 --> 15:46.144
The benefits of the bath
revealed Mr. Pimblett had a
shackle around his right ankle.

15:46.146 --> 15:48.846
He was imprisoned
before his death?

15:48.848 --> 15:53.885
Only one person would have
authority to do such a thing:
Captain Bernier.

16:08.534 --> 16:12.704
r coroner found evidence
of it.

16:12.706 --> 16:16.107
Just what did he do
to warrant imprisonment?

16:16.109 --> 16:18.176
(sighing)

16:18.178 --> 16:22.347
Poor, poor Arthur had gone mad.

16:22.349 --> 16:24.716
I was forced  to confine

16:24.718 --> 16:28.853
my best friend in his room,
for his own safety and
that of my crew.

16:28.855 --> 16:31.723
He was mad.
Well then,

16:31.725 --> 16:35.360
how is it he came to be three
miles away from your ship?
He escaped.

16:35.362 --> 16:38.596
I shackled him to a pipe
but he broke it and ran off.

16:38.598 --> 16:42.066
Lord knows what
he was thinking.

16:42.068 --> 16:44.335
What was he doing? I mean,

16:44.337 --> 16:47.238
how did this madness
manifest itself?

16:47.240 --> 16:50.875
He was delusional,
even thought we were
in the Pacific Ocean.

16:50.877 --> 16:56.014
Drawing maps and babbling
on about Pacific salmon.

16:56.016 --> 16:58.416
Pacific... Pacific salmon?

16:58.418 --> 17:01.753
I'm telling you, he was
deranged! Obsessed by the fish!

17:01.755 --> 17:05.456
Why did you keep this from us?
To preserve his name, sir.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.493
I'm sorry not
to tell you before.

17:08.495 --> 17:10.928
Are you now prepared
to tell us who strangled him?

17:10.930 --> 17:14.032
I don't know
nothing about it.

17:14.034 --> 17:16.401
I swear to you,
Detective.

17:16.403 --> 17:19.637
I can only imagine that
in his crazed state,

17:19.639 --> 17:23.041
he wandered into a hostile
Inuit community.

17:23.043 --> 17:26.477
You're suggesting that Mr.
Pimblett was killed by Inuit?

17:26.479 --> 17:28.646
Wouldn't be
the first time, sir.

17:33.485 --> 17:36.287
Sir, I'm to speak with Nuniq
this evening. I'll ask him

17:36.289 --> 17:39.290
the likelihood that Pimblett
was killed by Inuit.

17:39.292 --> 17:41.592
Or Nuniq himself, George.

17:47.866 --> 17:50.835
We're very lucky to get
a table at this restaurant.

17:50.837 --> 17:53.137
It's very popular
and, as you can see,

17:53.139 --> 17:56.007
very expensive.

18:00.746 --> 18:03.614
No, no, no.

18:03.616 --> 18:07.985
Very sorry, please excuse me.
I am Nuniq.
No, Nuniq.

18:07.987 --> 18:12.123
Please pardon my friend. He's
not accustomed to our customs.

18:12.125 --> 18:15.927
Nuniq--
Thank you.

18:17.429 --> 18:19.897
Sir.

18:24.369 --> 18:27.138
(chuckling)

18:27.140 --> 18:30.041
In my culture,
we share everything.

18:30.043 --> 18:32.210
My food is yours.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.345
Your food mine.

18:34.347 --> 18:38.182
In the beginning
it was not mine, or ours.

18:38.184 --> 18:40.718
Today it is not.

18:40.720 --> 18:46.190
I like the sound of that.
In some ways, that's more
civilized than our society.

18:46.192 --> 18:50.828
Sometimes it feels like
everybody's crawling
over one another

18:50.830 --> 18:53.798
for a bigger piece of
the pie. Shameful, really.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.667
We are happy people.

18:56.669 --> 19:00.505
Speaking of which, Nuniq,

19:00.507 --> 19:04.609
do you think it's possible that
Mr. Pimblett happened upon

19:04.611 --> 19:07.044
an Inuit tribe and
for whatever reason

19:07.046 --> 19:09.247
met his end that way?

19:09.249 --> 19:11.849
No.
I suppose

19:11.851 --> 19:16.354
you have no such thing as murder
in your culture either?
No, we do.

19:16.356 --> 19:20.858
But there are no
Inuit communities
near where I find Arthur.

19:20.860 --> 19:23.027
Impossible.

19:23.029 --> 19:26.230
Either white man
from ship kill him,

19:26.232 --> 19:29.267
or Qalupalik.
Qalupalik?

19:32.070 --> 19:36.307
Pardon us. We were wondering
what "Nuniq" means?

19:40.379 --> 19:43.447
Close your eyes.

19:49.321 --> 19:51.923
That's what Nuniq means.
(giggling)

19:51.925 --> 19:55.393
Join us, why don't you.

19:55.395 --> 19:59.630
Please, have a seat. There you
go. You as well, of course.

19:59.632 --> 20:02.667
Waiter, we'll have
another round!

20:05.237 --> 20:07.638
Here we are.

20:12.477 --> 20:16.214
I am Crabtree!
I am Nuniq!

20:16.216 --> 20:20.284
Nuniq, someone should make
a moving picture of
your time here.

20:20.286 --> 20:23.154
Like the Arctic
nickelodeon, but here.

20:23.156 --> 20:25.790
"Nuniq of Toronto."

20:25.792 --> 20:29.126
"Nuniq of Toronto."
Oy, shut it!

20:29.128 --> 20:33.731
Oh, quiet yourself. Nuniq,
I do have one serious question.

20:35.667 --> 20:38.603
Did you kill
Arthur Pimblett?

20:38.605 --> 20:41.706
No, we were friends.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.475
We talk about fish

20:44.477 --> 20:48.145
he draw in journal.
Salmon.

20:48.147 --> 20:51.716
He had a journal?
Can I see it?
No.

20:51.718 --> 20:55.353
Journal go missing
after he die.

20:59.024 --> 21:01.058
Ugh!

21:01.060 --> 21:03.527
Did you say salmon?

21:04.463 --> 21:07.331
Oh, how lovely.

21:07.333 --> 21:10.635
His brain came out
quite neatly.

21:10.637 --> 21:14.272
It'll make for a most
satisfying dissection.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.975
Now, the honour of cutting
the first slice is yours,

21:17.977 --> 21:21.045
Miss James.
I don't think I can,
Dr. Ogden.

21:21.047 --> 21:25.216
Why not?
I might become sick
on the subject.

21:25.218 --> 21:28.653
You'll get over it. Now
come get your hands dirty.

21:28.655 --> 21:32.490
We need to determine whether
a tumour was the cause of Mr.
Pimblett's supposed insanity.

21:40.198 --> 21:43.401
(squishy sounds)

21:43.403 --> 21:46.771
After you, Captain.

21:46.773 --> 21:49.774
The Eskimo said that Mr.
Pimblett's journal disappeared

21:49.776 --> 21:52.510
after he died. Do you know
where might we find it?
<i>Non.</i>

21:52.512 --> 21:55.880
But why would anyone want that?
We don't know,

21:55.882 --> 21:59.417
but the fact that it's missing
may have to do with his murder.
I doubt that.

21:59.419 --> 22:03.721
It was just drawings of fish
and random dates that
only he understood.

22:03.723 --> 22:07.792
But mostly fish. I'm telling you
he was totally insane--

22:07.794 --> 22:11.562
Yes, he was insane. But we
only have your word for that.

22:11.564 --> 22:16.067
Unfortunately, our Coroner
didn't find anything in his
brain to explain his insanity.

22:16.069 --> 22:19.804
Ask my crew, they
will tell you the same.
Our constable is doing that

22:19.806 --> 22:23.441
now, but I suspect they'll only
tell us what you want them
to tell us.

22:23.443 --> 22:26.243
What does it
matter anyway?

22:26.245 --> 22:30.114
Now that my reputation
is unfairly tarnished
with Arthur's blood,

22:30.116 --> 22:33.217
I'll never raise enough money
to get to the Pole.

22:33.219 --> 22:35.486
Nor will I find
his replacement.

22:35.488 --> 22:39.490
Arthur was truly one
of a kind, you know.
Gentlemen.

22:39.492 --> 22:42.126
Don't lose faith, Captain.

22:42.128 --> 22:45.296
If the Swedes do take the Pole,
before you know it,

22:45.298 --> 22:48.432
they'll be marching south
wanting more.
I can't allow that.

22:48.434 --> 22:50.835
That's why you need
to be forthright with us.

22:50.837 --> 22:53.738
The sooner we get this settled,
the sooner you'll be back
on the ship.

22:53.740 --> 22:57.575
You get my word, Inspector.
Then I wish you good luck
for your lecture.

22:57.577 --> 23:02.113
Thank you. Maybe you'd care to
make a contribution yourself?

23:02.115 --> 23:05.316
What do I get in return?
How do you mean?
Well,

23:05.318 --> 23:09.086
I'd be more inclined to donate
if I got something for it. Say,

23:09.088 --> 23:13.190
a jar of arctic ice
from the Pole. I'd pay
ten dollars for that.

23:14.926 --> 23:17.528
The crew was reluctant, sir,
but they eventually conceded

23:17.530 --> 23:21.298
that during the expedition
Pimblett went insane.
Anything else, George?

23:21.300 --> 23:24.402
Well, sir, the photographer,
Mr. Blair, he claims

23:24.404 --> 23:27.938
that Pimblett was already
insane, or eccentric
at the very least.

23:27.940 --> 23:32.410
How so?
Well, he claims that just
prior to the last expedition,

23:32.412 --> 23:36.180
Pimblett adopted a vegetarian
diet and tried to subsist
the whole time

23:36.182 --> 23:39.450
on canned vegetables.

23:39.452 --> 23:42.787
Well, unwise perhaps,
but far from convincing me
the man was insane.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.790
Also, sir, the crew says
that he'd become obsessed
with salmon,

23:45.792 --> 23:48.826
even though he never ate it,
he was continually
sketching salmon.

23:48.828 --> 23:52.163
Yes, I've heard
all about the salmon.
Well, if he did go a bit

23:52.165 --> 23:54.765
doolally, it at least explains
him being miles away
from the ship

23:54.767 --> 23:57.201
with no gloves on.

23:57.203 --> 24:00.704
Well, insane or otherwise,
we still don't know who
strangled him, or why.

24:00.706 --> 24:04.175
Especially if we take Nuniq's
word that there were
no Inuit nearby.

24:04.177 --> 24:07.745
Sirs, there is
another explanation.

24:08.547 --> 24:11.482
Qalupalik.
Now, in Inuit lore--

24:11.484 --> 24:15.986
(sighing)
Sir, in Inuit lore, Qalupalik
is a human-like creature

24:15.988 --> 24:19.857
and he crawls out of the sea,
with long stringy hair,

24:19.859 --> 24:23.160
and sharp fingernails
and webbed hands,

24:23.162 --> 24:25.463
and a greenish hue
to his skin.

24:25.465 --> 24:28.199
And he wears a pouch, sirs,
and he takes his victims

24:28.201 --> 24:30.734
and he stuffs them in his pouch
and he carries them--

24:30.736 --> 24:33.270
Oh, never mind.

24:33.272 --> 24:36.240
Never mind what?
I just remembered we still
have Mr. Pimblett's body,

24:36.242 --> 24:38.742
as where Qalupalik
carries his victims

24:38.744 --> 24:41.612
down beneath
the ocean forever.

24:41.614 --> 24:44.815
After the brain dissection
failed to reveal any
abnormalities,

24:44.817 --> 24:48.819
we conducted blood tests, which
showed high levels of lead.
Lead?

24:48.821 --> 24:53.190
Further examination of the
cadaver's tibia revealed
dense metaphyseal lines,

24:53.192 --> 24:56.093
a classic symptom
of lead poisoning.
I see.

24:56.095 --> 24:58.362
Other symptoms
include delirium,

24:58.364 --> 25:01.098
cognitive deficits,
and even hallucinations.

25:01.100 --> 25:05.236
Well, then I suppose
Captain Bernier was telling
the truth after all.

25:05.238 --> 25:09.540
Lead poisoning is often
the result of exposure to
contaminated soil or water.

25:09.542 --> 25:13.210
It seems unusual
that he would be the
only crew member to suffer.

25:13.212 --> 25:16.447
He had adopted
a vegetarian diet,

25:16.449 --> 25:20.251
brought all of his own canned
food aboard. Perhaps the tins

25:20.253 --> 25:24.588
were contaminated?
If he was the only one to eat
from them that would explain it.

25:24.590 --> 25:26.957
Well, then.

25:26.959 --> 25:30.394
Thank you, Miss James,
Dr. Ogden.

25:30.396 --> 25:32.563
Young Master Murdoch.

25:32.565 --> 25:34.732
Baba.

25:39.070 --> 25:41.672
I do think motherhood suits
you just fine, Dr. Ogden.

25:42.774 --> 25:44.942
Did you hear that?

25:44.944 --> 25:48.646
Our fearless Prime Minister
has already contributed

25:48.648 --> 25:52.750
two hundred thousand dollars,
but it's not enough.

25:52.752 --> 25:56.287
I ask that you consider
contributing

25:56.289 --> 25:58.822
to that most daring effort!

25:58.824 --> 26:02.826
(applause)

26:02.828 --> 26:07.097
But I am not looking for a
handout, my fellow Canadians.

26:07.099 --> 26:10.134
In return for your contribution,

26:10.136 --> 26:13.604
you will receive a priceless
token of appreciation.

26:13.606 --> 26:15.940
For ten dollars,

26:15.942 --> 26:19.043
I'll bring back a jar
of genuine arctic water

26:19.045 --> 26:22.379
direct form the Pole.
That was my idea.

26:22.381 --> 26:26.116
Very enterprising, sir.
And for five hundred dollars,

26:26.118 --> 26:30.521
you may become a member of
the crew of the CGS Arctic!

26:31.790 --> 26:34.658
Safe return not guaranteed.
(laughter)

26:34.660 --> 26:39.396
Five hundred... Margaret may
have that in her cookie jar.
Thank you, ladies

26:39.398 --> 26:43.000
and gentlemen.
The rest is yours.
(applause)

26:45.737 --> 26:50.140
Oh. Mr. Frewen, a word please.
I'm quite busy, Detective. The
Captain needs all hands on deck.

26:50.142 --> 26:54.345
Just why did Captain Bernier
insist on confining
Mr. Pimblett?

26:54.347 --> 26:56.614
What threat
did he pose exactly?

26:56.616 --> 27:00.751
Well, I suppose Mr. Pimblett
had become capricious,
aggressive even.

27:00.753 --> 27:03.153
Toward Captain Bernier?
Yes.

27:03.155 --> 27:05.823
In fact, he was so rife
with madness he tried
to start a mutiny.

27:05.825 --> 27:08.092
A mutiny? Why?

27:08.094 --> 27:10.661
He became convinced

27:10.663 --> 27:12.997
that the Captain
was leading us to death.

27:12.999 --> 27:16.667
Did his mutiny
gain any support?

27:16.669 --> 27:19.003
With some of the more
impressionable crew, yes.

27:19.005 --> 27:22.339
But thankfully the Captain
quashed the mutiny after
Mr. Pimblett's death

27:22.341 --> 27:24.642
and fired those
that betrayed him.

27:24.644 --> 27:28.646
Serves them right.
Mr. Frewen! Come and help!

27:30.382 --> 27:32.516
Excuse me, gentlemen.

27:32.518 --> 27:36.120
Don't speak to your superiors
like that, Mr. Philips.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.689
I am First Officer.
You're merely Third Officer.

27:38.691 --> 27:40.891
Oh, shut up and help me, you fool!

27:40.893 --> 27:43.260
A mutiny, sir.

27:43.262 --> 27:46.463
It gives Captain Bernier motive.
Mr. Pimblett

27:46.465 --> 27:50.567
must have discovered something
that threatened Captain
Bernier's future expeditions.

27:50.569 --> 27:53.303
Including his attempt
at the North Pole.

28:01.846 --> 28:04.848
That's why you shackled him,
isn't it?
I shackled him

28:04.850 --> 28:08.886
because he was mad.
But he also started a mutiny.

28:08.888 --> 28:12.589
Yes, obviously out of madness.

28:12.591 --> 28:15.793
But he was gaining support
with some of the crew members.

28:15.795 --> 28:18.562
Perhaps that's why
his journal went missing.

28:18.564 --> 28:22.599
It had details of the mutiny
which you wanted to keep
a secret.

28:22.601 --> 28:25.202
What are you suggesting?

28:25.204 --> 28:28.405
That your friend had become
a threat to the expedition,

28:28.407 --> 28:30.574
and to future ones.

28:30.576 --> 28:34.445
That he believed that you were
leading your men to their death.

28:34.447 --> 28:36.547
That if word of that got out,

28:36.549 --> 28:39.650
the Canadian government may
reconsider giving you a ship.

28:39.652 --> 28:43.654
So you think
I killed my best friend?

28:43.656 --> 28:47.424
It would have been easy
for you to strangle him
while he was shackled,

28:47.426 --> 28:50.894
and make it appear as though he
wandered off to freeze to death.

28:50.896 --> 28:54.498
That's quite
an accusation, Detective.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.768
It would also explain why
Mr. Pimblett was found
without gloves on,

28:57.770 --> 29:01.071
and why you yelled at Nuniq
for mentioning it.

29:03.174 --> 29:06.343
I'm very hurt. All I wanted

29:06.345 --> 29:09.046
was to keep Arthur's
madness a secret,

29:09.048 --> 29:12.316
and now I'm being
accused of his murder.

29:12.318 --> 29:17.254
Captain Bernier, did you
murder Arthur Pimblett?

29:18.356 --> 29:22.059
I will say no more.

29:22.061 --> 29:24.862
Well, if there is evidence,

29:24.864 --> 29:26.864
I will find it.

29:26.866 --> 29:30.467
In the meantime, I'll be
holding you in our cells.

29:38.376 --> 29:41.979
If he did it, why would he
bring the body all the way
back and hand it to us?

29:41.981 --> 29:45.649
A guilty conscience, perhaps?
What we do know of Bernier

29:45.651 --> 29:49.520
is that he ruled his ship
unconditionally and was one
of few who had access.

29:49.522 --> 29:52.356
Pimblett had lead poisoning.
He was a crackpot.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.892
How much of a threat
could he have been?
Sir, any threat at all

29:54.894 --> 29:59.563
gives the Captain motive. Until
he starts telling the truth,
I recommend we hold him.

29:59.565 --> 30:02.065
Even if it means Canada won't
be the first to the North Pole?

30:02.067 --> 30:05.302
Sirs, Canada may yet
still be the first.

30:05.304 --> 30:08.038
I've just been at the
exhibition. Mr. Philips

30:08.040 --> 30:11.074
has been named Captain
in Bernier's absence.
The Third Officer?

30:11.076 --> 30:14.044
That was bloody quick.
He's very young, sir,
but he's very ambitious

30:14.046 --> 30:16.547
and is said to be very talented.
Something of a prodigy.

30:16.549 --> 30:20.684
On whose authority?
The Government of Canada, sir.
It is their ship after all.

30:20.686 --> 30:23.353
He convinced them
he was up to the task.

30:23.355 --> 30:26.790
I'm surprised the expedition
wasn't scrapped altogether.
Bernier's the world authority

30:26.792 --> 30:30.227
on the Arctic. Without him,
it's doomed.
Maybe so,

30:30.229 --> 30:34.064
but this promotion gives
Mr. Philips motive.

30:42.674 --> 30:45.475
Sir.

30:45.477 --> 30:48.912
Mr. Blair, we're looking
for Mr. Philips.

30:48.914 --> 30:52.482
You won't find him here. He's
out celebrating his promotion.

30:52.484 --> 30:56.153
Are you planning
on leaving Toronto?
No, I live here.

30:56.155 --> 30:59.690
But I am leaving the employ
of the CGS Arctic now that
Philips is Captain.

30:59.692 --> 31:01.959
Why?
For all his talent,

31:01.961 --> 31:04.294
he's inexperienced
and far too ambitious.

31:04.296 --> 31:07.164
He may get them to the Pole, but
I doubt if they make it back.

31:07.166 --> 31:09.399
Why do you say that?

31:09.401 --> 31:13.370
When Captain Bernier cut
the last expedition short

31:13.372 --> 31:16.940
after Pimblett's death,
Philips nearly convinced him
to press on.

31:16.942 --> 31:20.110
I'm not about to risk my life
for the glory of someone

31:20.112 --> 31:23.046
who has little or no regard
for their crew's safety.

31:23.048 --> 31:26.149
Thank you, Mr. Blair.

31:28.186 --> 31:31.455
Uh, Mr. Blair, is that the
moving picture camera you used

31:31.457 --> 31:36.293
to make the nickelodeons?
Yes, why do you ask?

31:36.295 --> 31:41.164
This will be an excellent
nickelodeon. "Nuniq of the North
Visits Toronto."

31:56.481 --> 31:59.950
(chuckling)
(gasping)

31:59.952 --> 32:02.319
Oh!

32:02.321 --> 32:05.956
Not bad, eh?
Not bad, eh? The kick.

32:25.209 --> 32:27.177
Nuniq?

32:27.179 --> 32:28.979
Oy.

32:28.981 --> 32:33.350
Have you two retired?
What's this?

32:33.352 --> 32:36.119
This eventually will be
my nickelodeon, sir.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.455
Although I have
lost my subject.

32:38.457 --> 32:42.326
Have you not got work to do?
George insists that
this is work.

32:44.495 --> 32:47.664
Coming up here, sirs.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.666
Right there.

32:49.668 --> 32:52.169
Isn't that Mr. Nordenskjold

32:52.171 --> 32:54.705
dining with Mr. Philips?

32:54.707 --> 32:56.873
Just last night, sir.

32:56.875 --> 33:00.610
Canada's new Captain
dining with our chief rival.

33:00.612 --> 33:02.679
Bloody Swedes.

33:02.681 --> 33:05.916
Good work, George.

33:05.918 --> 33:10.087
Congratulations on your
promotion, Captain Philips.

33:10.089 --> 33:14.157
Thank you.
How did you celebrate?

33:14.159 --> 33:17.494
I enjoyed dinner with friends.

33:20.531 --> 33:23.367
These friends?

33:23.369 --> 33:27.704
Just what were you doing having
dinner with high-ranking Swedes

33:27.706 --> 33:30.607
when you're to be Captain
of a government-sanctioned

33:30.609 --> 33:34.177
Canadian expedition?
They wanted to speak with me.

33:34.179 --> 33:38.382
What about?
To see whether I might captain
their ship to the North Pole.

33:38.384 --> 33:41.284
Don't they have captains
of their own?
Yes,

33:41.286 --> 33:44.621
but Captain Bernier is
the best in the world,
and as his protégé,

33:44.623 --> 33:47.190
I am the next best thing.

33:47.192 --> 33:51.061
And what did you say?
That I would consider it.

33:51.063 --> 33:54.865
Though I doubt they could
outfit a finer vessel than
the CGS Arctic anyway.

33:54.867 --> 33:57.434
You would betray your country?

33:57.436 --> 34:00.237
I only care about being the
first man to the North Pole,

34:00.239 --> 34:05.175
whether it's under the flag of
Canada or Sweden. I see them
only as sponsors.

34:07.545 --> 34:09.780
That traitor should bloody hang.

34:09.782 --> 34:13.483
Maybe so. Yet
no law has been broken.
We'll see about that.

34:13.485 --> 34:16.953
I sent Crabtree to search
his room while you were
interviewing him.

34:16.955 --> 34:19.556
And it's true
that he's one of the few

34:19.558 --> 34:22.225
who could have stolen the
negatives leading up
to the show.

34:22.227 --> 34:25.896
And now he's leveraging his
newfound position to solicit
offers from the Swedes.

34:25.898 --> 34:28.665
Unless, sir, he's been working
with the Swedes the entire time.

34:28.667 --> 34:32.702
Mr. Pimblett caught on to him
and that's why he was killed?

34:32.704 --> 34:36.840
Philips then tries
to pin it on the Captain
and take his ship.

34:36.842 --> 34:40.577
Sirs, I found Pimblett's
missing journal in
Mr. Philips' room.

34:43.114 --> 34:45.115
Arrest him, George.

34:45.117 --> 34:47.350
Sir.

34:52.790 --> 34:56.026
<i>Mais en tout cas,</i>
<i>c'est sûrement possible.</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

34:56.028 --> 35:00.163
Sir, Mr. Pimblett wasn't
insane. Well, he was insane,

35:00.165 --> 35:04.935
but he made
a brilliant discovery.
A discovery that I dismissed.

35:04.937 --> 35:09.306
Well, what is it?
A yet-to-be-attempted route
to the North Pole.

35:09.308 --> 35:12.709
Daring in scope, but brilliant
in its simplicity.

35:12.711 --> 35:17.180
Every explorer has attempted
to reach the North Pole
from the east.

35:17.182 --> 35:21.184
But, by studying carefully
the weather patterns
and natural currents,

35:21.186 --> 35:24.187
Mr. Pimblett suggested that one
could reach the North Pole

35:24.189 --> 35:27.224
from the west, through
the Bering Strait.

35:27.226 --> 35:29.659
Well, what's so
brilliant about that?
This was long thought

35:29.661 --> 35:32.762
to be impossible. The distance
from the nearest point

35:32.764 --> 35:36.766
of land is much further.
He theorized that if you left

35:36.768 --> 35:39.336
at the exact right time
from the west

35:39.338 --> 35:42.372
and allowed the ship
to become locked in ice,

35:42.374 --> 35:44.975
the weather patterns

35:44.977 --> 35:48.378
and ocean currents would carry
you right to the North Pole.

35:48.380 --> 35:52.182
That sounds crackers.
Exactly.
But it's brilliant.

35:52.184 --> 35:55.418
His theory was validated
when he discovered salmon,

35:55.420 --> 35:59.689
pacific salmon locked in ice
in the east Arctic.

35:59.691 --> 36:02.058
Just as a ship would be,

36:02.060 --> 36:05.729
were it to be locked in ice,
having left from the west.

36:05.731 --> 36:09.032
But the final map detailing
how to accomplish this
is missing.

36:09.034 --> 36:11.001
It's been torn out of the journal.

36:11.003 --> 36:13.870
That bloody weasel Philips
must have it.

36:13.872 --> 36:18.275
I didn't steal the journal,
I... I don't know how
it wound up in my room.

36:18.277 --> 36:20.911
Where's the map?
What map?

36:20.913 --> 36:24.781
The map detailing how to get
to the North Pole from the west.
The west?

36:24.783 --> 36:29.686
I don't have such a map.
Although the Swedes did mention
something about a new route.

36:29.688 --> 36:31.821
What did they say?
They were vague,

36:31.823 --> 36:34.291
but they mentioned something
about a new route to the Pole
from the west.

36:34.293 --> 36:37.460
I thought they were as
insane as Pimblett.
My protégé.

36:37.462 --> 36:40.063
Shame on you for
talking to the Swedes.

36:40.065 --> 36:43.300
So the Swedes approached you
with this information, not
the other way around.

36:43.302 --> 36:46.469
Then the Swedes
must have the map.

36:49.707 --> 36:52.943
But how did they get it?

36:52.945 --> 36:56.780
Someone from your crew came
across Mr. Pimblett's diary,

36:56.782 --> 36:59.983
murdered him for it and
sold the map to the Swedes.

36:59.985 --> 37:02.619
I'm afraid one of your men
is working for them.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.921
A traitor? In my midst?

37:04.923 --> 37:09.926
But why would the Swedes turn
around and approach Philips
to be their Captain?

37:09.928 --> 37:13.830
In addition to gaining
a captain, they would be
leaving Canada without one.

37:13.832 --> 37:16.933
Then the traitor must be
a crew member here in Toronto,

37:16.935 --> 37:20.103
to have sabotaged
my slide show as well.

37:20.105 --> 37:22.806
What's that, Crabtree?

37:22.808 --> 37:26.309
Oh, sorry, sir,
it's my nickelodeon.
I'm just finishing it up.

37:26.311 --> 37:30.113
Even though Nuniq
abandoned you?
I wouldn't say

37:30.115 --> 37:33.683
he abandoned me, sir.
We just haven't been spending
as much time together lately.

37:33.685 --> 37:37.520
I hear he's quite
the man about town.
It's true, sir.

37:37.522 --> 37:40.657
I'm glad. I'm glad he's meeting
new people in Toronto.

37:40.659 --> 37:43.627
Heaven knows where
he's been sleeping.

37:43.629 --> 37:45.895
Nuniq! There you are!

37:45.897 --> 37:49.766
I've been worried about you.
Can I come back to your home
to stay?

37:49.768 --> 37:52.335
Yes, of course.
I miss home.

37:52.337 --> 37:54.871
I want to go back,
but I don't trust

37:54.873 --> 37:57.540
the new Captain can
make safe journey.

37:57.542 --> 38:01.011
The new captain, Mr. Philips,
he's in our jail cells.

38:01.013 --> 38:04.781
No, Derek Frewen is
the new Captain now.

38:04.783 --> 38:07.250
The First Officer?

38:08.552 --> 38:11.888
Frewen has been made the new
Captain of the CGS Arctic.

38:11.890 --> 38:16.660
Pff! Ridiculous! Frewen
is a reliable First Mate,
but a hopeless leader!

38:16.662 --> 38:19.429
Doesn't mean he doesn't have
ambitions for more.

38:20.598 --> 38:25.268
Frewen is the traitor.
Betrayed by my own First Mate.

38:25.270 --> 38:28.738
Let's say he came across
Mr. Pimblett's journal,

38:28.740 --> 38:31.741
he recognized its value,
and murdered him for it.

38:31.743 --> 38:35.478
By pinning the murder on you,
he would be eliminating

38:35.480 --> 38:39.816
all of Sweden's competition.
Then he shares Pimblett's
western route with the Swedes.

38:39.818 --> 38:43.153
But when Mr. Philips became
Captain, Mr. Frewen
felt passed over,

38:43.155 --> 38:46.623
so he attempted to frame him by
placing the journal in his room.

38:46.625 --> 38:50.360
And according to Nuniq, Frewen
has himself a train ticket
to Vancouver.

38:50.362 --> 38:53.630
Where he'll assemble
his own crew and head
for the North Pole.

38:53.632 --> 38:55.865
To claim it for bloody Sweden.

38:55.867 --> 38:58.201
He's been the traitor
all along.

38:58.203 --> 39:00.704
George.

39:09.980 --> 39:12.615
Sir,
there's Mr. Frewen now.

39:14.185 --> 39:17.187
Oh, Mr. Frewen!

39:17.189 --> 39:19.389
Stop!

39:19.391 --> 39:21.391
Drive!

39:21.393 --> 39:25.528
Drive! Go!
Stop!

39:39.343 --> 39:43.179
Hey!
Out of the way!

39:46.784 --> 39:49.686
Hurry, Frewen!

39:49.688 --> 39:53.089
I'm free! And I'm going to
take the North Pole for Sweden!

39:53.091 --> 39:56.860
I'm gonna leave--
Get in, you fool!

39:57.995 --> 39:59.963
Long live Sweden!

39:59.965 --> 40:04.501
Sir, should we give chase?
I don't think so, George.

40:04.503 --> 40:08.238
We have the man we want.

40:10.174 --> 40:13.777
They're not going to be getting
anywhere near the North Pole
without this.

40:13.779 --> 40:16.513
Long live Sweden.

40:16.515 --> 40:20.350
Mr. Frewen, you are under
arrest for the murder
of Arthur Pimblett,

40:20.352 --> 40:24.020
and for treason.
Long live Canada.

40:35.533 --> 40:39.369
Yes. I miss family. Thank you
for Toronto, Crabtree.

40:39.371 --> 40:42.872
You certainly made the most
of it. I have something for you.

40:44.809 --> 40:47.477
"Nuniq of the North
in Toronto."

40:47.479 --> 40:51.681
This way, your family can share
in the experience. Mr. Blair
said he'd project it for you.

40:51.683 --> 40:55.752
Thank you, Crabtree.

40:55.754 --> 40:59.522
Nuniq means kiss.

40:59.524 --> 41:02.959
No, I just say that.
"Kunik" means kiss.

41:02.961 --> 41:05.061
So what does Nuniq mean?

41:05.063 --> 41:07.397
Another time.

41:13.671 --> 41:16.439
<i>Merci.</i> Thank you all
for your generous support.

41:16.441 --> 41:19.108
Captain.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.411
I see the fundraising campaign
is a success.

41:21.413 --> 41:23.880
Would you like
to join my expedition?

41:23.882 --> 41:26.749
Well, I'm flattered--
Not you, Inspector.

41:26.751 --> 41:29.419
You, Detective.
Me?
Yeah.

41:29.421 --> 41:32.989
You're a man of science, and
by translating Arthur's journal,

41:32.991 --> 41:35.892
you proved yourself
a worthy replacement.

41:35.894 --> 41:38.928
If you need a real seaman,
you take me, not Murdoch.

41:38.930 --> 41:41.698
That may be, Inspector.

41:41.700 --> 41:45.134
But there can be
only one Captain,

41:45.136 --> 41:48.137
and you, my friend,
you're a Captain as well.

41:48.139 --> 41:50.874
Ahh. Captain of Station
House Number Four.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.877
Well.

41:53.879 --> 41:57.480
Captain.

42:05.823 --> 42:11.494
You know, Captain Bernier
asked me to join him
on his expedition.

42:11.496 --> 42:14.497
Did he now?
Hmm.

42:14.499 --> 42:18.568
But I told him I could not
accept on account of
being a father.

42:18.570 --> 42:21.604
And how long would
the expedition take?

42:21.606 --> 42:24.774
Four years.
Give or take a year.

42:24.776 --> 42:27.710
But if not for being a father,

42:27.712 --> 42:30.647
you would go? Leaving me
here for four years?

42:30.649 --> 42:32.982
You would wait for me, Julia.

42:32.984 --> 42:35.385
Oh...

42:35.387 --> 42:38.154
Don't be so sure.

42:38.156 --> 42:41.591
Speaking of being a father,
where is our child?

42:41.593 --> 42:45.194
Right this way.

42:54.872 --> 42:59.475
It replicates the motion of
bouncing him on one's knee.

42:59.477 --> 43:03.746
(babbling happily)
Look how happy he is.

43:03.748 --> 43:06.482
Yes,
he's our gleeful bouncer.

43:06.484 --> 43:09.619
I could use one of those
at the morgue.

43:09.621 --> 43:12.422
That's why I've made three:
one for the morgue,

43:12.424 --> 43:15.091
one for here and
one for my office.

43:15.093 --> 43:17.160
That way, Roland can remain occupied

43:17.162 --> 43:21.197
while we go about our work.
We'll never miss a moment.
No.

43:21.199 --> 43:24.567
No.
(laughing)
