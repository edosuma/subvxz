00:28.560 --> 00:30.070
Ah!

00:30.800 --> 00:33.500
~

02:02.320 --> 02:04.840
- Bacon roti.
- Thank you.

02:06.200 --> 02:07.790
Seriously?

02:07.840 --> 02:10.070
You've haven't lived, seriously.

02:10.620 --> 02:13.310
Brown sauce? You got some!

02:13.360 --> 02:15.590
I could kiss you.

02:15.640 --> 02:18.350
- You've tried this?
- Yes. Quite foul.

02:18.400 --> 02:20.200
Ah!

02:21.240 --> 02:22.630
Oh.

02:23.280 --> 02:25.120
Just, erm...

02:29.600 --> 02:31.920
Marcus? Hi.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.710
Sorry?

02:34.760 --> 02:36.920
So all I have to do is sign it?

02:38.960 --> 02:40.750
If you're still OK to sell the place?

02:40.800 --> 02:44.270
I mean, we can talk about it if you like.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.030
But it's an offer at the asking price

02:46.080 --> 02:47.990
and they want to move as soon as possible.

02:48.040 --> 02:49.630
No. No, no.

02:49.680 --> 02:52.880
Sure. I mean, it's fine.
It's what we agreed on.

02:56.200 --> 02:57.990
What time is it over there?

02:58.040 --> 03:00.560
Oh, it's t'middle of the bloody night.

03:01.560 --> 03:04.470
Another false alarm. Couldn't sleep.

03:04.520 --> 03:07.880
So... how are you?

03:09.800 --> 03:11.630
Good.

03:11.680 --> 03:13.400
Really good.

03:28.680 --> 03:32.030
Listen, if this goes wrong,
the hospital is over there.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.400
OK?

03:42.540 --> 03:44.390
You are joking?

03:44.440 --> 03:46.230
Oh, she didn't?

03:46.280 --> 03:50.030
I told you, your mum is clinically insane.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.710
You remember that time we went over

03:51.760 --> 03:54.230
and she answered the door stark naked?

03:54.280 --> 03:55.980
Right. Yeah, that's her story.

03:56.480 --> 03:59.190
- Oh, shit. I've gotta go.
- Dr Walker, we're needed.

03:59.240 --> 04:01.590
- A nun has collapsed.
- I've got to go.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.640
- Dr Walker?
- Yeah, just send it.

04:04.680 --> 04:06.830
Did you just say a nun has collapsed?

04:06.880 --> 04:08.800
Exactly.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.190
You look terrible.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.510
I feel terrible.

04:17.560 --> 04:19.670
No, no, no. No time for
that. Come on. Get up!

04:19.720 --> 04:21.430
- OK.
- Come on!

04:21.480 --> 04:23.080
Leave that!

04:24.120 --> 04:25.830
OK, Dad, what are you doing?

04:25.880 --> 04:27.470
Time to smarten you up.

04:27.520 --> 04:29.840
- You look like a damn tramp.
- Look...

04:32.640 --> 04:35.040
Is this him?

04:39.240 --> 04:40.720
Yes.

04:45.720 --> 04:47.510
Handsome enough, I suppose.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.470
With work.

04:49.520 --> 04:53.270
What's with these rags? Clothes
maketh the man, Dr Nair.

04:53.320 --> 04:55.510
I... I know. I've tried, Miss Pradeep,

04:55.560 --> 04:58.110
- but the boy just won't listen.
- OK. Can I just say...

04:58.160 --> 04:59.910
Ssh! They never do.

04:59.960 --> 05:01.710
If only you'd taken after your father.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.750
Clearly a man who knows how to dress.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.950
Oh, you are too kind, Miss Pradeep.

05:06.000 --> 05:09.070
- Will you to take him on?
- Ordinarily, no, I would not.

05:09.120 --> 05:11.110
My client list is exclusive.

05:11.160 --> 05:12.830
They expect the very best.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.880
I understand.

05:16.520 --> 05:19.720
But, erm, then, I do like a challenge.

05:20.960 --> 05:23.070
Marrying off this boy will be my...

05:23.120 --> 05:24.990
- ultimate achievement.
- Really?

05:25.040 --> 05:29.270
Yes. Your son is, er... my Everest.

05:31.880 --> 05:33.340
Oh, I'm sorry.

05:33.390 --> 05:35.470
- There's a call from Chennai.
- Sure.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.150
- Excuse me. Hello?
- Are you crazy?

05:37.200 --> 05:38.790
I don't need a marriage broker.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.950
- Are you married?
- No, but...

05:41.000 --> 05:44.110
My point precisely. My son
is in need of female company.

05:44.160 --> 05:46.830
This way, we can get
somebody who's appropriate.

05:46.880 --> 05:49.470
"Appropriate"? You mean "brown", right?

05:49.520 --> 05:52.590
I mean a girl who's... who's
a serious proposition.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.270
That's all I ask. Only,
if your mother were here,

05:55.320 --> 05:58.150
- she'd have wanted this too.
- I'm not listening to this.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.840
- Oh, AJ. AJ!
- Ooh.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.950
Crab racing?

06:07.000 --> 06:09.230
Imagine the Grand National, only sideways.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.150
And you bet on this nonsense?

06:11.200 --> 06:12.870
No.

06:12.920 --> 06:14.510
Not at all.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.830
Gambling's strictly illegal in India.

06:16.880 --> 06:19.830
Which is why Greg McConnell's
Annual Crab National

06:19.880 --> 06:21.870
is incredibly popular.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.230
Places strictly limited.

06:24.280 --> 06:27.120
So, are you in?

06:29.760 --> 06:32.790
Go on, then. When in Rome...

06:32.840 --> 06:34.550
A thousand rupees.

06:34.600 --> 06:37.910
- Do you want to see the form?
- Bloody crabs have form?

06:37.960 --> 06:40.990
I get the impression you're not
taking this entirely seriously.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.160
- Just put it on the favourite.
- Oh...

06:43.800 --> 06:46.360
- Each way.
- Very wise.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.120
Incoming.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.240
- Hiya.
- Hi.

07:07.080 --> 07:09.190
You're unnaturally quiet, Dr Walker.

07:09.240 --> 07:10.830
Usually, I can't shut you up.

07:10.880 --> 07:12.870
Something bothering you?

07:12.920 --> 07:15.390
It's fine. Not important.

07:15.440 --> 07:17.720
Why don't you let me be the judge of that?

07:18.840 --> 07:20.230
Well?

07:20.280 --> 07:22.350
We're selling my house.

07:22.400 --> 07:24.190
Our house.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.470
Which I suppose means it really is over.

07:26.520 --> 07:28.510
Me and Marcus.

07:28.560 --> 07:30.750
God put those eyes in
the front of your head

07:30.800 --> 07:33.190
for a reason, Dr Walker.
Look forward in life.

07:33.240 --> 07:35.870
Turn the next corner and
meet the future head on.

07:35.920 --> 07:37.510
I know, I know.

07:37.560 --> 07:39.760
We met when I was 16.

07:40.800 --> 07:42.800
He was the first boy I ever kissed.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.750
And you stayed with him?

07:45.800 --> 07:48.600
How lacking in imagination
you must have been.

07:49.400 --> 07:51.270
- I think I was in love.
- Impossible.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.910
You were only children.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.390
The whole thing sounds
like a dreadful mistake.

07:55.440 --> 07:57.070
Take my advice.

07:57.120 --> 08:00.430
A man you don't love is like a
sticking plaster you don't need.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.280
Just rip it off. It only
ever hurts for a second.

08:03.920 --> 08:06.550
- You're probably right.
- No "probably" about it.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.990
Haven't you realised
by now I'm always right?

08:09.040 --> 08:11.040
It's a cross I have to bear.

08:17.640 --> 08:19.230
You love trains.

08:19.280 --> 08:21.550
I prefer sitting down with a light ale.

08:21.600 --> 08:24.310
You're not well and I hate bloody temples.

08:24.360 --> 08:25.950
Tough. We're going.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.990
It'll be a cultural experience.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.400
I refer you to my previous answer.

08:31.440 --> 08:33.150
And you'll have to change.

08:33.200 --> 08:35.280
You can't meet God in a Villa shirt.

08:43.360 --> 08:45.350
So the nuns make wedding dresses?

08:45.400 --> 08:48.350
It's a tradition that
stretches back donkey's years.

08:48.400 --> 08:51.670
Young brides travel for days
to collect their trousseaus.

08:51.720 --> 08:53.350
It's a form of devotion.

08:53.400 --> 08:56.630
Exalting God through
labour. Some people pray.

08:56.680 --> 08:59.670
Here they sew and stitch
wedding gowns for Jesus.

08:59.720 --> 09:01.710
- Sounds amazing.
- Or ridiculous.

09:01.760 --> 09:05.070
Remind me to lend you my copy
of The Female Eunuch, Dr Walker.

09:05.120 --> 09:07.230
- Hello.
- Still, she looks happy.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.150
Didn't we all?

09:09.200 --> 09:11.310
Thank you for coming so quickly.

09:11.360 --> 09:13.430
Had she complained of feeling unwell?

09:13.480 --> 09:16.910
Sister Inez has taken a vow
of silence, Dr Fonseca.

09:16.960 --> 09:18.750
I wouldn't expect her to.

09:18.800 --> 09:22.240
In this order, we take
discipline very seriously.

09:24.920 --> 09:26.560
And here?

09:27.480 --> 09:29.080
Sickness, fever?

09:30.720 --> 09:33.880
How about when you pee? Mutra.

09:34.600 --> 09:36.840
You may speak to the doctor.

09:39.760 --> 09:41.430
It hurts.

09:41.480 --> 09:44.710
Well, I think you'll live, but
you should've called me earlier.

09:44.760 --> 09:47.910
It's probably a urinary tract
infection coupled with a faint.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.660
We're going to need a sample.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.870
So this will tell us if
you have an infection.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.310
We can check for blood,
protein, white blood cells.

09:57.360 --> 10:00.150
Of which you have a full
house. Congratulations.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.190
So what happens now?

10:02.240 --> 10:04.390
We need to start you on
a course of antibiotics.

10:04.440 --> 10:06.940
We need to make sure
you drink plenty of...

10:13.960 --> 10:15.640
Is everything all right?

10:18.400 --> 10:21.150
The tests we've taken indicate
that you do indeed have

10:21.200 --> 10:23.000
a urinary tract infection...

10:24.120 --> 10:26.280
.. but also that you're pregnant.

10:55.780 --> 10:57.170
Did you really need me to wear this shirt?

10:57.220 --> 10:59.410
Traps the heat like nobody's business.

10:59.460 --> 11:01.330
Now I know why Gandhi wore a bed sheet.

11:01.380 --> 11:03.680
You look good in black. Everyone does.

11:03.980 --> 11:05.810
OK. OK.

11:05.860 --> 11:08.690
Why are all the blokes wearing
flowers round their necks?

11:08.740 --> 11:10.730
It's traditional.

11:10.780 --> 11:12.650
It says so in the guidebook.

11:12.700 --> 11:16.780
You should be wearing
one, too. Excuse me. Here.

11:21.340 --> 11:24.300
Oh, stop fussing. Come on. It's this way.

11:41.260 --> 11:43.260
You do understand what this means?

11:44.300 --> 11:47.330
Of course. This baby is a gift.

11:47.380 --> 11:49.380
A true miracle.

11:50.060 --> 11:52.660
So, do you have any idea
who gave you this gift?

11:53.580 --> 11:55.530
Isn't it obvious?

11:55.580 --> 11:57.100
It's Him.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.290
You believe her?

12:11.340 --> 12:13.250
That she has an immaculate conception?

12:13.300 --> 12:15.090
I may be an extremely lapsed Catholic,

12:15.140 --> 12:16.610
but I'm not totally stupid.

12:16.660 --> 12:20.340
No, some miracles are more
easily explained than others.

12:27.380 --> 12:29.280
OK. Lift your right arm, please.

12:30.020 --> 12:31.700
And now your left.

12:34.060 --> 12:36.490
- Believe me, I'm trying.
- You see?

12:36.540 --> 12:40.260
I'm afraid it looks like
you've suffered a stroke.

12:41.900 --> 12:44.690
That's why you can't move your left side.

12:44.740 --> 12:46.890
Now, when did this all start?

12:46.940 --> 12:48.730
- Less than an hour ago.
- Uh-huh.

12:48.780 --> 12:53.250
This place was the nearest.
So what happens now?

12:53.300 --> 12:56.530
I'll prescribe some
treatment to thin the blood

12:56.580 --> 12:58.810
and then you'll need a
scan, which I can arrange.

12:58.860 --> 13:01.890
In the meantime, we'll
do everything that we can.

13:01.940 --> 13:03.250
OK?

13:03.300 --> 13:05.540
- Thank you.
- OK.

13:07.140 --> 13:09.260
My husband, he'll get better?

13:11.060 --> 13:13.130
Er...

13:13.180 --> 13:17.260
I'm afraid that, at this stage,
that is impossible to say.

13:18.780 --> 13:20.770
We want the best treatment.

13:20.820 --> 13:22.410
We have funds.

13:22.460 --> 13:24.810
And Dr Nair is a personal
friend of my husband.

13:24.860 --> 13:29.290
Yes, er, all our patients get
the very best we can offer.

13:29.340 --> 13:32.850
I'll make sure that Dr Nair
is aware your husband is here

13:32.900 --> 13:35.970
and he can arrange any transfer
if that's what you'd prefer.

13:36.020 --> 13:37.420
Thank you.

13:43.580 --> 13:46.130
"We have funds", hm?

13:46.180 --> 13:48.690
The girl had nothing
before she married him.

13:48.740 --> 13:50.410
You don't approve, Sister?

13:50.460 --> 13:52.610
In sickness and in health, Doctor.

13:52.660 --> 13:56.460
Perhaps now we'll see
how true that is. Hm?

14:01.380 --> 14:03.690
I am pleased her condition is not serious,

14:03.740 --> 14:07.330
but I'm very much against my
novices leaving the convent

14:07.380 --> 14:09.770
unless there's a genuine emergency.

14:09.820 --> 14:13.330
Now, is this ultrasound
scan really necessary?

14:13.380 --> 14:15.050
Absolutely essential.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.770
I've arranged for an
appointment first thing tomorrow

14:17.820 --> 14:19.930
and, given the circumstances,

14:19.980 --> 14:22.700
I wish to take care of
this case personally.

14:23.740 --> 14:26.980
In that case, I will make an exception.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.970
What's going to happen
to her once Mother Carmen

14:31.020 --> 14:32.890
- finds out she's pregnant?
- God knows,

14:32.940 --> 14:35.440
but she's gonna need
help to deal with this.

14:36.020 --> 14:37.490
So how long were you married?

14:37.540 --> 14:39.450
Whoa! What brought that on?

14:39.500 --> 14:41.770
Sorry. If you don't wanna talk about it...

14:41.820 --> 14:44.980
One confession deserves
another, I suppose.

14:46.100 --> 14:51.180
Jules Fonseca was... an entertaining man.

14:52.220 --> 14:57.020
Impossible, but entertaining,
right up to the day he left.

14:58.060 --> 15:00.730
- But you still kept his name?
- If you had my maiden name...

15:00.780 --> 15:02.770
- What was it?
- I have never told anyone

15:02.820 --> 15:05.580
- and never will.
- So what happened?

15:06.620 --> 15:09.290
I woke up one morning and he'd gone.

15:09.340 --> 15:11.210
Haven't heard from him since.

15:11.260 --> 15:13.010
Wow!

15:13.060 --> 15:15.490
- That must've been hard.
- Yeah, well, life goes on.

15:15.540 --> 15:18.580
Just rip it off and it
only hurts for a second.

15:20.020 --> 15:22.340
And the sex was fantastic.

15:27.780 --> 15:30.690
So, Josie, what first attracted you to

15:30.740 --> 15:34.410
this exciting, public facing
retail employment opportunity?

15:34.460 --> 15:36.050
Sorry?

15:36.100 --> 15:38.810
- Why do you wanna work here?
- Truthfully?

15:38.860 --> 15:41.450
- Always.
- I really don't,

15:41.500 --> 15:44.210
but it's my fastest route to a
plane ticket out of here so...

15:44.260 --> 15:45.890
I see.

15:45.940 --> 15:47.850
In that case, you're hired.

15:47.900 --> 15:49.530
Really?

15:49.580 --> 15:50.980
Mm.

15:51.820 --> 15:53.130
Amazing.

15:53.180 --> 15:55.450
Miraculous. You were the only applicant.

15:55.500 --> 15:58.090
So when can you start?

15:58.140 --> 16:00.050
- As soon as you need me.
- Good answer.

16:00.100 --> 16:01.690
Can you tell me what this is?

16:01.740 --> 16:03.730
- A dishcloth.
- You're a natural.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.380
Come on.

16:11.220 --> 16:12.810
You gave her a job?

16:12.860 --> 16:14.860
She was by far the best candidate.

16:17.180 --> 16:18.770
OK, what about them?

16:18.820 --> 16:21.810
- She's gonna be so jealous...
- They run out of money,

16:21.860 --> 16:24.170
Daddy FedEx's a new credit card.

16:24.220 --> 16:26.500
Her desperation is my profit margin.

16:27.180 --> 16:29.170
Oh, that's it. I'm gonna kill myself.

16:29.220 --> 16:31.970
Fine. Just not here.
Suicide's bad for business.

16:32.020 --> 16:35.460
No. It's worse than that. My
father hired a marriage broker.

16:39.820 --> 16:41.410
Is that so bad?

16:41.460 --> 16:43.810
Means a lot less effort on your part.

16:43.860 --> 16:45.770
So you would have an arranged marriage?

16:45.820 --> 16:47.770
I met a girl once.

16:47.820 --> 16:50.050
Clever, pretty, sweet.

16:50.100 --> 16:52.140
For some reason, she liked me.

16:53.020 --> 16:55.620
Wanted to get hitched,
kids, the whole deal.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.540
OK. So what did you do?

16:59.540 --> 17:01.250
I bought a one-way ticket to India.

17:01.300 --> 17:04.369
I just think you should
consider the alternatives

17:04.420 --> 17:06.300
before it's too late.

17:08.099 --> 17:10.650
Hari Menon. I went to school with him.

17:10.700 --> 17:12.690
He was in my class. What's wrong with him?

17:12.740 --> 17:15.250
- Stroke. Left hemi.
- Oh.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.450
I've started anti-platelet therapy.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.369
So is he a close friend of yours?

17:19.420 --> 17:20.970
I haven't seen him in years.

17:21.020 --> 17:22.970
I heard he remarried, a younger woman.

17:23.020 --> 17:25.089
Yes, very attractive.

17:25.140 --> 17:27.410
- Mari doesn't approve.
- Ha!

17:27.460 --> 17:30.250
Hari never cared about what
other people thought of him.

17:30.300 --> 17:32.500
Probably that's how he got so rich.

17:41.140 --> 17:42.940
Mr Menon, how are you?

18:25.780 --> 18:27.850
Is this it?

18:27.900 --> 18:29.490
No.

18:29.540 --> 18:31.210
How much further is it?

18:31.260 --> 18:37.530
Oh, about eight to 12
kilometres depending on...

18:37.580 --> 18:39.290
12 kilometres?

18:39.340 --> 18:41.540
That's nearly... That's bloody miles.

18:43.300 --> 18:45.290
If you can't handle a small hike,

18:45.340 --> 18:47.450
you're welcome to stay here.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.220
Us ladies will pick you
up when we're done.

19:17.300 --> 19:19.290
What is it, child?

19:19.340 --> 19:21.420
I have good news, Mother...

19:24.300 --> 19:25.970
Well?

19:26.020 --> 19:28.420
And she just threw you out?

19:29.380 --> 19:33.570
I was... I was so happy, so proud.

19:33.620 --> 19:35.610
Couldn't keep it in any more.

19:35.660 --> 19:39.340
I thought Mother Carmen, a
woman of God, would understand.

19:41.140 --> 19:44.330
She called me things. Dreadful things.

19:44.380 --> 19:46.660
Said I'd brought shame on the order.

19:47.700 --> 19:49.700
Well, did you?

19:50.740 --> 19:54.330
A handsome young man can
make the best of us lapse.

19:54.380 --> 19:55.970
No.

19:56.020 --> 19:57.660
Of course not.

20:00.300 --> 20:04.060
I swear by Almighty God, Dr
Fonseca, I have done nothing.

20:06.780 --> 20:08.740
Nothing.

20:10.860 --> 20:12.890
In that case, I think we'd better find out

20:12.940 --> 20:15.610
what's going on here, don't you?

20:15.660 --> 20:17.300
(Yes.)

20:22.580 --> 20:24.300
Push a little harder.

20:25.460 --> 20:27.180
That's good. Now rotate it.

20:28.380 --> 20:30.410
Like this.

20:30.460 --> 20:32.090
There.

20:32.140 --> 20:33.860
You see it?

20:35.060 --> 20:36.900
Not really.

20:37.980 --> 20:40.450
Sorry, I just can't visualise a foetus.

20:40.500 --> 20:43.610
I'd hope so too. The
uterus is there. Empty.

20:43.660 --> 20:45.860
This is what you should be looking at.

20:46.380 --> 20:49.330
- What is it, Doctor?
- You have a cyst on your ovary.

20:49.380 --> 20:53.090
A dermoid, if I'm not mistaken,
which explains everything.

20:53.140 --> 20:55.060
You're not pregnant.

21:12.700 --> 21:15.690
You have a benign growth on your ovary.

21:15.740 --> 21:18.010
Inside is tissue that has developed

21:18.060 --> 21:19.650
like a foetus would have done,

21:19.700 --> 21:22.050
which is why your pregnancy
test was positive.

21:22.100 --> 21:24.340
So, it was all a mistake?

21:25.380 --> 21:27.090
There's no baby?

21:27.140 --> 21:29.530
No, and there never was.

21:29.580 --> 21:31.930
You will have to have the cyst removed,

21:31.980 --> 21:34.890
but it's a relatively simple procedure.

21:34.940 --> 21:36.450
You'll make a full recovery.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.140
Thank you.

21:39.980 --> 21:43.050
- I'm sorry.
- You do understand.

21:43.100 --> 21:44.930
We can treat this.

21:44.980 --> 21:46.780
It's not that.

21:48.740 --> 21:50.730
When I thought I'd been chosen,

21:50.780 --> 21:55.660
when I thought it was a
miracle, it made me so happy.

21:57.420 --> 21:59.410
I hadn't been sure, you see.

21:59.460 --> 22:03.570
I'd had doubts, bad thoughts.

22:03.620 --> 22:04.940
Then this.

22:07.420 --> 22:09.890
It was as if God was speaking to me.

22:09.940 --> 22:13.260
Telling me He was real and
that I was His servant.

22:16.180 --> 22:17.970
But this?

22:18.020 --> 22:20.020
This is an abomination.

22:21.220 --> 22:23.050
It's not real.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.780
None of it is.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.700
It's all been a lie.

22:31.660 --> 22:33.810
I want the operation, please.

22:33.860 --> 22:36.180
I need it out of me as soon as possible.

22:39.300 --> 22:41.620
And I'd like to borrow some clothes.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.570
Put her in a bed and call
the gynaecologists in Kochi.

22:47.620 --> 22:50.050
Arrange for an appointment
as soon as possible.

22:50.100 --> 22:53.010
- Where are you going?
- To commit a mortal sin.

22:53.060 --> 22:54.650
Dr Fonseca!

22:54.700 --> 22:57.690
You will not use language
like that in a house of God.

22:57.740 --> 23:01.010
God? And what do you think He would say

23:01.060 --> 23:02.930
about the way you've treated this girl?

23:02.980 --> 23:04.970
Mercy and forgiveness?

23:05.020 --> 23:07.330
Rules must be obeyed.

23:07.380 --> 23:09.210
If a genuine mistake has been made,

23:09.260 --> 23:12.650
the girl can return to the
convent any time she likes.

23:12.700 --> 23:14.730
God is nothing if not merciful.

23:14.780 --> 23:16.690
And what ever happened to trust?

23:16.740 --> 23:19.050
Trust comes with discipline.

23:19.100 --> 23:22.300
Oh, yes, discipline.

23:24.020 --> 23:26.770
I spent ten years being
taught by women like you.

23:26.820 --> 23:29.450
Believe me, those scars
don't heal so easily.

23:29.500 --> 23:32.490
Look where it got you, Dr
Fonseca. A glittering career.

23:32.540 --> 23:34.450
Sometimes a little discipline

23:34.500 --> 23:37.220
can work wonders for the rebellious.

23:55.220 --> 23:57.020
Yes, yes. All right.

24:07.660 --> 24:09.330
Right, that's it. I'm done.

24:09.380 --> 24:11.050
Sorry.

24:11.100 --> 24:13.090
- Sorry.
- Oh, it's not much further.

24:13.140 --> 24:15.130
I'm knackered. My feet are blistered.

24:15.180 --> 24:17.170
The bloody mosquitoes think my ankles are

24:17.220 --> 24:19.290
their personal World Darts Championship.

24:19.340 --> 24:21.610
I swear, it's like Lakeside down there.

24:21.660 --> 24:25.970
But this temple, Paul, you'll
really love it, I swear.

24:26.020 --> 24:28.250
Seen one temple, you've
seen 'em all. I'm done.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.490
No. We're not going back.

24:30.540 --> 24:32.890
We can't. I need to...

24:32.940 --> 24:34.620
You need to what?

24:36.340 --> 24:37.980
You need to what, Maggie?

24:39.060 --> 24:44.970
Tonight, a star appears in
the woods above the temple.

24:45.020 --> 24:47.610
The Arundhati star.

24:47.660 --> 24:50.540
It always appears, always, and it's...

24:51.460 --> 24:55.570
Well, they say it's got
these healing powers.

24:55.620 --> 24:58.290
And it's...

24:58.340 --> 25:02.010
I thought I should at least try to see it.

25:02.060 --> 25:03.290
What?

25:03.340 --> 25:05.410
Christ!

25:05.460 --> 25:07.170
A bloody healing star!

25:07.220 --> 25:08.890
Jesus, Maggie.

25:08.940 --> 25:11.290
Our daughter has been calling us every day

25:11.340 --> 25:14.130
and I've been lying to her,
telling her everything is fine.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.930
- Stop shouting, Paul.
- You think this is shouting?

25:16.980 --> 25:19.330
This is nothing. I hate it here!

25:19.380 --> 25:21.570
I hate the heat, the flies!

25:21.620 --> 25:23.770
The money doesn't make any sense at all.

25:23.820 --> 25:26.170
I've stuck it out because...

25:26.220 --> 25:29.330
- God knows why we're doing it.
- Paul...

25:29.380 --> 25:32.170
Now you are literally leading
me up the bloody garden path

25:32.220 --> 25:34.930
because you think some poxy speck of light

25:34.980 --> 25:37.650
billions of miles away
is gonna fix everything,

25:37.700 --> 25:39.210
when we could be back home

25:39.260 --> 25:41.490
surrounded by people who love you.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.170
Why this? Why...? Why here?

25:44.220 --> 25:46.890
We've got a life, family, friends,

25:46.940 --> 25:48.610
back home in bloody Stourbridge

25:48.660 --> 25:52.610
where it's cold and miserable
and you can get proper Nando's.

25:52.660 --> 25:54.250
I miss those things, Maggie.

25:54.300 --> 25:56.650
And you should miss them too,

25:56.700 --> 26:01.330
if you weren't so bloody
self-obsessed and selfish.

26:01.380 --> 26:03.460
Maggie!

26:06.340 --> 26:07.980
Help!

26:10.780 --> 26:12.780
Somebody help me!

26:16.880 --> 26:18.830
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh! Come on.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.510
Excuse me. Move it!

26:20.560 --> 26:22.390
I don't think we can get up here.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.070
Come on. Come on.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.870
Come on. AJ, come on.

26:30.920 --> 26:32.870
Come on. Excuse me.

26:34.420 --> 26:35.320
Excuse me, guys.

26:47.920 --> 26:50.710
Easy, love. Easy. You have to sip it.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.640
Not too much at a time.

26:53.840 --> 26:56.280
Oh, thank God. Over here!

27:08.200 --> 27:09.590
She's severely dehydrated.

27:09.640 --> 27:12.350
What are you doing hauling her
out to the middle of nowhere?

27:12.400 --> 27:15.830
No. No. She was fine. She was
the one who wanted to do it.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.870
It's the Aru... doodah star, or something.

27:17.920 --> 27:21.160
Yes, I know what it is. We need
to get her to the hospital now.

27:22.720 --> 27:25.790
- Where's the bloody ambulance?
- Next corner.

27:25.840 --> 27:28.140
Thank God for that. Nearly there, love.

27:37.680 --> 27:39.960
Oh! Sorry, memsahib.

28:00.420 --> 28:01.080
Hey.

28:03.120 --> 28:04.870
Are you OK?

28:04.920 --> 28:07.420
Yesterday I would have prayed with them.

28:10.520 --> 28:12.710
I'm sure they'd be grateful
if you joined them.

28:12.760 --> 28:14.760
To ask God for a miracle?

28:15.920 --> 28:17.990
Well, if it gives people hope...

28:18.040 --> 28:19.670
Yesterday I trusted Him

28:19.720 --> 28:22.760
and then I find all He wants
to do is make a fool of me.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.280
No-one thinks that.

28:26.320 --> 28:28.120
I do.

28:30.520 --> 28:32.520
Come on.

28:39.920 --> 28:41.790
Good afternoon.

28:41.840 --> 28:42.540
Here you go.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.590
Blimey!

28:45.640 --> 28:47.670
- Has it been a year already?
- Yeah.

28:47.720 --> 28:49.470
- You know I always win?
- Yes.

28:49.520 --> 28:51.510
Your recurrent good fortune astounds me.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.430
No-one picks a crab like Lydia Fonseca.

28:54.480 --> 28:57.790
I had considered banning you,
but that didn't seem sporting.

28:57.840 --> 28:59.630
OK. That one.

28:59.680 --> 29:01.270
5,000 rupees.

29:01.320 --> 29:03.030
Crazy Claude at fifty to one.

29:03.080 --> 29:05.040
Bold choice.

29:07.920 --> 29:11.990
What would you do if you saw a
young girl ruining her life?

29:12.040 --> 29:15.040
I usually tell 'em not to stop
and promise 'em a lift home.

29:18.400 --> 29:20.950
If it was me, absolutely nothing.

29:21.000 --> 29:24.030
If it's you we're talking
about, I'd bet 50,000 rupees

29:24.080 --> 29:26.110
that you're gonna stick your nose in.

29:26.160 --> 29:27.600
Talking of which...

29:35.600 --> 29:37.360
Help yourself.

30:03.000 --> 30:04.990
Tell me you are not serious.

30:05.040 --> 30:08.150
I warned her of the risks, that
we could only offer the basics,

30:08.200 --> 30:11.110
- but she insisted on staying.
- You listened to her, Dr Varma?

30:11.160 --> 30:15.030
Yes. She's my patient. She has a
right to make her own decisions.

30:15.080 --> 30:17.870
What about this nonsense about
some healing star in the East?

30:17.920 --> 30:19.910
That part of your
prescription too, was it?

30:19.960 --> 30:21.870
If she had told me, I would've stopped it.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.390
I knew nothing about this.

30:23.440 --> 30:26.350
It seems ignorance is
your default setting.

30:26.400 --> 30:29.270
- Continue fluid resuscitation.
- I will.

30:29.320 --> 30:31.150
If she doesn't recover quickly,

30:31.200 --> 30:33.430
we'll need a transfer
to Kochi for a CT scan.

30:33.480 --> 30:36.470
Check her intracerebral pressure's OK.

30:36.520 --> 30:39.420
- Do the family know?
- That's her husband over there.

30:42.520 --> 30:44.510
Well, you should put him in the picture.

30:44.560 --> 30:46.960
And it's not a pretty one.

31:23.560 --> 31:25.120
Yes, Dr Walker?

31:35.640 --> 31:37.710
Dr Walker is concerned about you.

31:37.760 --> 31:39.560
She thinks we need to talk.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.280
Or maybe you just need to listen.

31:47.160 --> 31:50.350
You thought that God had
given you a virgin birth.

31:50.400 --> 31:52.350
A gift.

31:52.400 --> 31:55.270
But, in reality, biology
gave you a better one.

31:55.320 --> 31:56.920
The truth.

31:58.720 --> 32:01.390
I've seen what this life can do.

32:01.440 --> 32:04.070
Death coming to those
who least deserve it.

32:04.120 --> 32:08.520
Illness and misery striking
down the purest of heart.

32:09.640 --> 32:14.640
If He exists at all,
then He's a cruel tyrant.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.110
Why shut yourself away from humanity?

32:19.160 --> 32:20.950
See it with your own eyes.

32:21.000 --> 32:24.270
There's a whole world out
there waiting for you.

32:24.320 --> 32:26.960
Now I have nowhere to go.

32:30.680 --> 32:32.360
Is that so bad?

32:36.360 --> 32:39.270
If we explained the diagnosis,
the convent would have her back?

32:39.320 --> 32:41.630
- Oh, they'll have her back.
- I don't understand.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.190
I went to see her
so-called Mother Superior.

32:44.240 --> 32:45.950
She's welcome to return.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.630
You don't think we should tell her?

32:47.680 --> 32:50.310
She's young, Dr Walker. She
has a chance to start again.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.070
- She's lost. Vulnerable.
- Aren't we all?

32:53.120 --> 32:56.020
The sooner she learns to
deal with it, the better.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.000
Lydia's Lydia.

33:01.040 --> 33:03.710
She manipulates people
and refuses to apologise.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.150
I thought you would have
figured that out by now.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.830
And we just accept it?

33:07.880 --> 33:10.280
Well, I don't think any
of us have a choice.

33:10.760 --> 33:12.480
We could leave.

33:13.520 --> 33:15.560
That's true.

33:16.360 --> 33:17.260
So, why don't you?

33:19.800 --> 33:22.710
No, really. I'm interested.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.830
Why are you here?

33:24.880 --> 33:28.750
Why not Chennai or... or Delhi?

33:28.800 --> 33:31.840
I mean, you're a brilliant doctor.

33:33.080 --> 33:35.400
Maybe it's all I deserve.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.800
Now, Maggie Smart nearly died today.

33:43.080 --> 33:45.510
All because I let her do what she wanted.

33:45.560 --> 33:47.870
No. No, you listened.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.550
You tried to help.

33:49.600 --> 33:51.520
And it nearly killed her.

33:53.280 --> 33:55.280
You know, maybe Lydia's right.

33:56.240 --> 33:58.740
People need to be told
what's good for them.

34:00.560 --> 34:02.950
I mean, that's why I
always tell you what to do,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.700
because obviously I
know what's good for you.

34:11.080 --> 34:13.040
Marcus is selling up.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.280
That's what the phone call was about.

34:17.760 --> 34:20.960
We were supposed to spend the
rest of our lives together.

34:21.719 --> 34:24.480
Now that's a failure.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.560
I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.

34:45.480 --> 34:47.270
I should... I should get back.

34:47.320 --> 34:49.920
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Yes. I'll...

34:59.800 --> 35:01.890
Sister! Sister!

35:01.940 --> 35:03.660
Come quick! Quick!

35:05.980 --> 35:07.450
You see.

35:07.500 --> 35:10.170
See? It's a miracle. He's cured.

35:10.220 --> 35:12.220
Isn't it wonderful?

35:14.060 --> 35:17.060
- Praise the Lord!
- Praise Him indeed.

35:17.700 --> 35:20.130
I'll tell the doctor.

35:25.700 --> 35:28.610
They should tattoo it on
our arms at medical school.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.330
Never give up on a
stroke on the first day.

35:31.380 --> 35:35.530
One man's transient ischaemic
attack is another man's miracle.

35:35.580 --> 35:38.490
Perhaps we should go and explain.

35:38.540 --> 35:41.450
No. We all need a little
magic now and again.

35:41.500 --> 35:43.620
Some more than others.

35:46.380 --> 35:47.780
Yeah.

35:50.180 --> 35:52.170
Go on, do it today.

35:52.220 --> 35:54.850
You never know what tomorrow might bring.

35:54.900 --> 35:56.580
Excuse me.

36:06.240 --> 36:07.040
Give me five.

36:07.820 --> 36:10.170
My sincerest apologies, Miss Pradeep.

36:10.220 --> 36:12.810
The boy flatly refuses to cooperate.

36:12.860 --> 36:15.370
Our children are a gift, Dr Nair,

36:15.420 --> 36:17.170
but a gift that has been sent to try us.

36:17.220 --> 36:19.330
Ah.

36:19.380 --> 36:20.970
Of course,

36:21.020 --> 36:25.490
eligible men come in all
shapes and sizes... and ages.

36:25.540 --> 36:27.610
Are you married?

36:27.660 --> 36:30.540
- Widowed.
- Even better.

36:31.740 --> 36:34.890
I have many lovely ladies
who'd like nothing better

36:34.940 --> 36:38.580
than a charming doctor with a
little sadness behind his eyes.

36:40.060 --> 36:43.860
Unless the whole idea is
completely out of the question?

36:45.260 --> 36:47.460
There's no harm in discussing it.

36:50.540 --> 36:51.980
I'll be in touch.

36:59.900 --> 37:02.460
On your marks...

37:03.260 --> 37:05.550
.. get set, scuttle!

37:07.100 --> 37:10.690
They're off at Greg McConnell's
Annual Crab National.

37:10.740 --> 37:13.650
Not much going on at the
beginning. They'll warm up.

37:13.700 --> 37:15.970
A bit of liveliness
happening over here now.

37:16.020 --> 37:18.290
- Go! Go!
- Who's this? Great form.

37:18.340 --> 37:21.050
Someone's making a break
for the border here.

37:21.100 --> 37:24.890
It's the Hooded Claw making
a break for the border. No.

37:24.940 --> 37:28.180
No, it's actually...
It's No.3. No.3 making...

37:32.380 --> 37:33.770
Hi.

37:33.820 --> 37:35.450
Wow!

37:35.500 --> 37:38.050
Miss Pradeep, I was not expecting you.

37:38.100 --> 37:40.490
No, I mean... You look wonderful.

37:40.540 --> 37:42.380
Thank you.

37:45.380 --> 37:47.810
If your son was half
the gentleman you are,

37:47.860 --> 37:50.760
every woman in India would
be offering her hand.

37:52.740 --> 37:55.340
And, please, call me Mala.

37:56.460 --> 37:57.650
Mala.

37:59.460 --> 38:02.290
Look at her! He's making a
total fool out of himself.

38:02.340 --> 38:04.730
Is he? Are you sure it isn't you?

38:04.780 --> 38:07.210
Oh, my God.

38:07.260 --> 38:10.330
That's it! Go!

38:11.940 --> 38:14.410
We have a winner. We have a winner.

38:14.460 --> 38:17.650
And it's Legs & Co, ladies and gentlemen.

38:17.700 --> 38:19.290
Legs & Co, our favourite.

38:19.340 --> 38:20.930
Who had Legs & Co?

38:20.980 --> 38:23.130
Who had the favourite? It was Paul.

38:23.180 --> 38:25.460
Where's Paul?

38:27.300 --> 38:28.970
You were right.

38:29.020 --> 38:30.620
Hm?

38:31.580 --> 38:34.170
I shouldn't have taken us up there.

38:34.220 --> 38:36.860
Hey. It doesn't matter now.

38:37.980 --> 38:40.290
That's exactly why it matters.

38:40.340 --> 38:44.610
Stupid waste of a precious day.

38:44.660 --> 38:47.700
No day's wasted if I'm with you, love.

38:48.940 --> 38:51.330
Here. Home.

38:51.380 --> 38:53.060
Hot trains.

38:54.980 --> 38:56.900
Hospital.

39:00.260 --> 39:01.810
Sorry I shouted.

39:01.860 --> 39:03.860
It's OK.

39:11.380 --> 39:13.530
We need to call Debbie, love.

39:13.580 --> 39:15.570
Let me call her.

39:15.620 --> 39:18.180
We have to tell her
exactly what's going on.

39:19.220 --> 39:22.650
You're sick, love, and she's our daughter.

39:22.700 --> 39:24.900
She deserves the truth.

39:43.700 --> 39:45.700
You can't sleep here.

39:50.180 --> 39:52.090
God! Shit!

39:52.140 --> 39:54.970
Help! Help, Gabriel! I need help here!

39:55.020 --> 39:56.820
We need to get her up now!

40:16.740 --> 40:20.010
- OK. I'm in.
- What's going on?

40:20.060 --> 40:21.650
Female, 20s, attempted suicide.

40:21.700 --> 40:25.060
Deep lacerations to both wrists.
Severe hypovolemic shock.

40:26.780 --> 40:30.050
- Sinus rhythm?
- Fine, 88.

40:30.100 --> 40:32.170
- Blood pressure?
- Better, 80 systolic.

40:32.220 --> 40:34.810
Chase up the cross match.
Two more units of red cells.

40:34.860 --> 40:38.460
I'll call Kochi and arrange
an urgent transfer.

40:41.300 --> 40:44.250
Wait! She tried to kill herself.

40:44.300 --> 40:46.890
- A heartbeat from succeeding.
- I'm fully aware of that.

40:46.940 --> 40:49.130
She was down for five,
ten minutes. Maybe more.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.490
We both know what that means.

40:51.540 --> 40:53.970
This should never have
happened. She needed help.

40:54.020 --> 40:56.250
- Our help.
- Which I gave her.

40:56.300 --> 40:58.930
No. No, you just told her
how to live her life.

40:58.980 --> 41:00.770
I simply did what I thought was right.

41:00.820 --> 41:03.130
I know. You always do.

41:03.180 --> 41:04.820
This time you were wrong.

41:06.500 --> 41:08.300
Is that all?

41:29.900 --> 41:31.890
You won. The whole pot.

41:31.940 --> 41:33.530
How much?

41:33.580 --> 41:36.080
I think, technically,
you're a millionaire.

41:36.740 --> 41:38.700
I'm sorry you couldn't make it.

41:39.860 --> 41:41.490
How is she?

41:41.540 --> 41:43.050
Better.

41:43.100 --> 41:45.100
Considering.

41:46.140 --> 41:50.060
In the circumstances, the
bar decided to come to you.

41:52.580 --> 41:54.100
I won't make a habit of it.

41:58.740 --> 42:00.420
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

42:12.900 --> 42:15.140
Thank you.

42:32.220 --> 42:34.020
Lydia?

42:38.860 --> 42:40.420
Hey...

43:19.420 --> 43:20.820
