11:09.016 --> 11:11.801
She was blindfolded and moved
around in the trunks of cars.

11:11.845 --> 11:14.021
She doesn't
have a clue.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.588
WENDY:
She's suffering from PTSD.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.199
With everything
she's been through,

11:18.242 --> 11:19.504
it's no wonder.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.550
We need to get her to a hospital
for a rape kit,

and STD tests.

[Sikora speaking Bulgarian]

11:30.211 --> 11:32.692
I told her to go
with you, to the doctor.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.739
[quietly]:
No. You keep it.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.568
And what's gonna happen to her?

11:39.611 --> 11:42.005
Because she's an undocumented
minor, I have to alert

11:42.049 --> 11:43.572
Social Services.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.272
Anything out
of Varga's girlfriend?

11:48.316 --> 11:50.361
Besides her demented take
on the American Dream? No.

11:50.405 --> 11:51.885
But we found something
in her purse.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.365
It's a barbershop in Echo Park
owned by Jovan Balic,

11:54.409 --> 11:56.193

Belgrade 20 years ago.

We ran the number.

Belongs to a burner phone
that was deactivated

12:01.677 --> 12:04.245
right after Ava disappeared.What do the words mean?

12:05.463 --> 12:06.856
"Virgin skin, good prices."

When Ava last called you,
she said

12:13.036 --> 12:15.430
she was meeting Varga
and his crew at Echo Park.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.910
I bet that barbershop's
just a brothel

12:16.953 --> 12:19.303
for Varga to
supply girls to.

12:19.347 --> 12:20.478
You know the place?

No. It wasn't ever on our radar.

Ava. Do you have any news?

We haven't located her yet,
but we arrested a suspect

12:42.849 --> 12:44.415
who we're hoping can point us
in the right direction.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.026
We knew Ava worked undercover,

12:46.069 --> 12:48.550

safeguards in place.

13:08.962 --> 13:10.093
When she joined
the police,

13:10.137 --> 13:11.660
it wasn't exactly the career

13:11.703 --> 13:14.141
we pictured for her.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.578
But we supported her.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.275
Just wish she would've told us

13:18.319 --> 13:20.800
how dangerous
this job really was.

from worrying about her.

undercover operations

the calls to keep her safe.

she could handle it,

18:11.438 --> 18:12.439
you would've called off
the meet.

18:12.482 --> 18:16.747

18:16.791 --> 18:19.968

I-I should've,

to turn around.

joined my team,

18:38.204 --> 18:40.858
he went undercover
to bust a crew of car thieves.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.469
We lost him for a while.

18:42.512 --> 18:46.255
Just like Ava,
all his comms went dark.

18:46.299 --> 18:47.474
What happened?

18:47.517 --> 18:50.041
We barely got his ass back.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.653
But I waited
until we got Street back safely

18:52.696 --> 18:54.611

about it.

back in the game,

barbershop, how are they doing?

19:14.457 --> 19:15.676
Physically, they'll heal fine.

Mentally, it could take years.

being blindfolded and put
into trunks with bags of coffee

being transported.

the brothel earlier?

19:35.522 --> 19:38.002
Yeah. Yeah, he posted bail
about a half hour ago. Why?

19:38.046 --> 19:39.526
Well, we just got a call.
There's a barricade situation

19:39.569 --> 19:40.788
at his home.

talk him down,

about my daughter?

No, no. But she told me once
that Varga

20:21.959 --> 20:24.092
took off her blindfold
somewhere in a back room

20:24.135 --> 20:26.268

grinding coffee

You haven't found Ava.
Maybe I can.

20:43.894 --> 20:46.810
George, we've got new intel
on Ava's whereabouts.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.294

you're just slowing us down

20:52.338 --> 20:53.339

21:01.347 --> 21:02.913
put you down!

would have known

21:47.784 --> 21:49.786
about the Hungarians'
involvement

21:49.830 --> 21:51.614
is if you told him.
Am I wrong?

21:51.658 --> 21:53.921
George happened to see Petavich
when we hauled him in.

21:53.964 --> 21:56.358
And when he saw him,
he asked if he was responsible

21:56.402 --> 21:58.317
for his daughter's
disappearance.

21:59.666 --> 22:03.147
Maybe he saw it on my face.Damn it!

22:03.191 --> 22:04.888
What were you thinking?I wasn't gonna lie to him.

22:04.932 --> 22:08.022
I mean, what if it was one of
your kids who was kidnapped?

22:08.065 --> 22:09.980
Wouldn't you want to know
who was responsible?

22:10.024 --> 22:12.983
Don't throw hypotheticals at me.
You screwed up.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.333
Then punish me.

22:14.376 --> 22:15.986
Not Ava's dad.
Please.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.553
It's too late for that now.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.731
If you read my jacket, you know
my mom died when I was 13.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.691
I know every word
in your jacket.

22:24.734 --> 22:27.737
Your mother was killed
in an accident on the 5 Freeway.

22:27.781 --> 22:31.132
I'm sorry, but what does that
have to do with this?

22:32.960 --> 22:35.266
When I was in the seventh grade,
a cop pulled me out of class

22:35.310 --> 22:37.573
and drove me down
to Hollenbeck Station.

22:37.617 --> 22:42.404
He parked me on a bench,
where I waited for an hour.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.493
Then these two other officers
were walking by,

22:44.537 --> 22:47.714
talking about a woman who got
turned into highway hamburger.

22:47.757 --> 22:50.064
Oh, geez...
Laughing about
how sorry they felt

22:50.107 --> 22:53.720
for the Caltrans team who had
to scrape her off the road.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.161
Then they finally noticed me
and asked me for my name.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.730
When I told them Alonso,

23:03.773 --> 23:06.036
they could barely
look me in the eyes

23:06.080 --> 23:08.169
when they told me
it was my mom who died.

23:10.737 --> 23:13.217
It's a shame you had to
hear it that way.

23:13.261 --> 23:15.524
When I became police,
I swore nothing like that

23:15.568 --> 23:17.874
would ever happen on my watch.

23:17.918 --> 23:20.137
I was just trying to be honest

23:20.181 --> 23:23.227
and respectful to Ava's parents.

23:26.753 --> 23:29.190
All right, yeah, it's...

23:30.409 --> 23:31.497
Get back to the team.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.589
And let's bring Ava back alive.

23:42.986 --> 23:44.335
What's with the history books?

23:44.379 --> 23:46.468
So we found coffee
in Danika's trunk.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.427
The Serbian girls
then told Dr. Wendy

23:48.470 --> 23:51.038
something about laying
on bags of coffee.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.169
And then Petavich
admitted that

23:52.213 --> 23:53.562
the girl he visited
in the brothel

23:53.606 --> 23:55.695
met an old Hungarian man
who was grinding coffee.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.914
So we got to thinking there's
got to be a connection, right?

23:57.958 --> 24:00.351
We started digging
and found this guy.

24:00.395 --> 24:03.137
Anton Boros. Came over
from Hungary in '79

24:03.180 --> 24:05.748
after being released from prison
for killing a business rival.

24:05.792 --> 24:09.622
Boros... he was a nasty piece
of work back in the day.

24:09.665 --> 24:12.712
Considered the Hungarian
godfather of L.A.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.757
He's been off LAPD's radar
for a decade.

24:14.801 --> 24:16.455
Organized Crime never
got enough to indict him.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.239
Assumed he was inactive.

24:18.282 --> 24:20.894
A gangster who happily retired?
That doesn't happen very often.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.548
What's Boros up to now?

24:22.591 --> 24:24.811
He owns a café
in Echo Park,

24:24.854 --> 24:27.596
specializing in
Hungarian coffee.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.556
So Boros isn't as retired
as everyone thought.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.645

24:34.995 --> 24:37.606

He's closed.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.436
You ever seen her?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.133
Never.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.658
What's your relationship
to Bal Kez, Jakob Varga?

24:45.701 --> 24:47.094
Are you helping them
smuggle underage girls here

24:47.137 --> 24:49.531

24:49.575 --> 24:52.316

24:52.360 --> 24:54.449
Then what's this bad boy for?

24:54.493 --> 24:58.366
Security system.Her name is Ava Ilic.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.324
She disappeared yesterday, and
we think that Varga and his boys

25:00.368 --> 25:01.456
are keeping her hostage.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.327
Ilic.

25:03.371 --> 25:05.808

25:05.852 --> 25:07.331
Well, I'm sorry
for her family,

25:07.375 --> 25:09.899
but I have no idea what
you're talking about.

25:09.943 --> 25:11.553
All the years that you
outsmarted the cops

25:11.597 --> 25:13.555
and never spent a night in jail.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.818
It'd be a damn shame if you
spent the last years

25:15.862 --> 25:18.429
of your life in prison
for somebody else's crimes.

25:23.434 --> 25:28.135
If I tell you all I know
about Jakob Varga,

25:28.178 --> 25:29.397
I won't be arrested?

25:29.440 --> 25:31.094

25:34.141 --> 25:37.405
I am not part of Bal Kez.

25:37.448 --> 25:41.714
I-I supply the coffee
to mask the smell,

25:41.757 --> 25:43.803

where they're coming from.

25:43.846 --> 25:44.804
And where's that?

25:44.847 --> 25:45.892

25:52.507 --> 25:56.206

26:29.892 --> 26:31.372

38:05.674 --> 38:07.676
The D.A. won't just
sweep this under the rug.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.504
Sir, regardless
of what happened,

38:09.548 --> 38:11.158
I'm still an advocate
for Ava's family.

38:11.201 --> 38:14.161
Assistant District Attorney
Kemper is handling

38:14.204 --> 38:15.989
the charges
against Ava's father.

38:16.032 --> 38:19.645
Now, I phoned and suggested they
be dropped down to misdemeanors,

38:19.688 --> 38:21.995
but Kemper didn't seem
too willing to budge.

38:22.038 --> 38:24.911
Maybe you can convince him.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.044
Thanks.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.008
Should we be worried
about Luca?

38:35.051 --> 38:36.488
Nah, he'll be back
in no time.

38:36.531 --> 38:38.490
Guy's indestructible.

38:38.533 --> 38:41.188
Listen, for you
guys at your age,

38:41.231 --> 38:42.842
it's easy to take a hit
and jump right back,

38:42.885 --> 38:45.497
but for the rest of us...

38:45.540 --> 38:46.889
What, are you
"Old Man Deacon" now?

38:46.933 --> 38:48.064
Nah, I'm just saying.

38:48.108 --> 38:50.197
Once you hit 35,

38:50.240 --> 38:53.374
it gets harder and harder
to bounce back, that's all.

38:53.418 --> 38:57.291
Those little aches and pains
that you used to laugh off?

38:57.335 --> 38:59.249
Now they got you
limping for a week.

38:59.293 --> 39:01.382
Oh, come on, Deac, we
know you and Luca both

39:01.426 --> 39:02.862
got a couple more
decades in you.

39:02.905 --> 39:04.254
[laughs softly]

39:04.298 --> 39:05.865
Nah, the only thing
I know is that there's

39:05.908 --> 39:07.954
an expiration date
for all us doing this job.

39:07.997 --> 39:09.738
And sometimes,

39:09.782 --> 39:12.132
you see the end coming straight
at you and sometimes...

39:12.175 --> 39:14.961
it sneaks up on your six.

39:21.881 --> 39:24.318
Thought you went home
and crashed.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.408
Nah, I had some paperwork
I had to finish up.

39:27.452 --> 39:30.106
More responsibility,
more work.

39:30.150 --> 39:31.891
I feel you.

39:31.934 --> 39:33.675
Be careful what you
wish for, right?

39:33.719 --> 39:35.155
[laughs]
Yeah...

39:35.198 --> 39:36.809
Listen, I hope
after all of this,

39:36.852 --> 39:39.115
you take some vacation days,
get your head right.

39:39.159 --> 39:41.335
I already put in
for six weeks.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.642
I haven't taken leave for years,
but my wife's always

39:43.685 --> 39:45.687
wanted to rent an RV,
head across country.

39:45.731 --> 39:47.341
[chuckles]

39:47.385 --> 39:49.343
Hey, listen, man.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.085
Thank you.

39:52.128 --> 39:53.303
Nah, come on, man.

39:53.347 --> 39:54.783
Getting Ava back
was a team effort.

39:54.827 --> 39:55.784
No.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.917
I mean for your honesty.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.745
I've done countless

39:59.788 --> 40:03.401
undercover missions
and I never once cracked.

40:03.444 --> 40:05.446
I was in a dark place.

40:05.490 --> 40:08.101
But your words...

40:08.144 --> 40:11.452
well, they got me through it.

40:11.496 --> 40:14.760
As team leaders, sometimes
we got to be reminded

40:14.803 --> 40:17.632
that the weight of the world
isn't always on our shoulders.

40:17.676 --> 40:20.243
We got brothers
and sisters to count on.

40:20.287 --> 40:22.420
Amen.
