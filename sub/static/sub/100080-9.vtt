00:08.530 --> 00:10.619
â™ª

00:16.712 --> 00:18.148
Ah.

00:18.192 --> 00:19.932
I'm sorry for
calling so late,

00:19.976 --> 00:21.847
but I don't do my first
bump till midnight.

00:21.891 --> 00:24.415
I'm not here to party,

00:24.459 --> 00:26.548
but if you still have a girl
for sale, I'm interested.

00:26.591 --> 00:28.071
How much can you afford?

00:28.115 --> 00:29.942
Depends on her age.

00:29.986 --> 00:32.858
15. Bulgarian.

00:32.902 --> 00:36.775
She's got those blue eyes,
and the skin of a doll's.

00:40.083 --> 00:42.259
Beautiful, huh?

00:42.303 --> 00:45.393
She's a steal for 60 grand.

00:49.658 --> 00:52.791
50. I can give you 25 tonight,

00:52.835 --> 00:55.142
another 25 after
she turns a profit.

01:00.408 --> 01:01.409
[man speaks Bulgarian]

01:01.452 --> 01:02.584
Let's go.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.940
Your name is Kella Prodic?

01:10.983 --> 01:13.377
You came to this country
ten years ago

01:13.421 --> 01:15.205
from the village
of Ozora?

01:15.249 --> 01:17.947
It was 12 years ago, but yes.

01:17.990 --> 01:20.993
I have a cousin
in Ozora.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.647
He says no one's
ever heard of you.

01:22.691 --> 01:25.085
Ozora is a big village.

01:25.128 --> 01:26.521
Not that big.

01:26.564 --> 01:28.827
Search it.

01:31.091 --> 01:34.311
Jakob, what the hell is this?

01:34.355 --> 01:38.141
Wait, you called me. I'm just
trying to do business here.

01:47.846 --> 01:48.934
Light it.

02:00.424 --> 02:04.863
You always have
cigarettes,

02:04.907 --> 02:08.432
but I never
see you smoke.

02:09.607 --> 02:11.957
What's this?

02:12.001 --> 02:14.134
A microphone?

02:14.177 --> 02:15.744
Jakob, it's not what you think.

02:15.787 --> 02:19.922
What are you? Some kind of spy
for one of my rivals?

02:19.965 --> 02:21.445
No. I swear.[snaps fingers]

02:21.489 --> 02:23.795
No!
[muffled screaming]

02:23.839 --> 02:26.189
[buzzing][grunts]

02:28.800 --> 02:31.673
You better do this
before I change my mind.

02:33.501 --> 02:34.763
[laughter, applause]

02:34.806 --> 02:37.244
I know that's not supposed
to be that funny,

02:37.287 --> 02:38.506
but that's funny.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.638
You know, of all
the tac gear we tested

02:40.682 --> 02:42.292
at the SHOT Show
in Vegas last month,

02:42.336 --> 02:43.641
these vendors
were our favorites.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.252
TAN: Yeah, we invited them
out to L.A.,

02:45.295 --> 02:46.644
so you and Hondo
could judge for yourselves.

02:46.688 --> 02:47.863
Appreciate you guys
setting this up.

02:47.906 --> 02:49.430
Besides hitting the SHOT Show,

02:49.473 --> 02:51.867
what other kind of trouble did
you guys get into in Sin City?

02:51.910 --> 02:53.999
Mm, mm, mm.
Strictly business.

02:54.043 --> 02:55.871
We hit the floor bright
and early every day.

02:55.914 --> 02:58.003
Yeah, I'm sure you guys
kept a rigid curfew.

02:58.047 --> 02:59.788
So how much did you drop
at the roulette table?

02:59.831 --> 03:01.920
Oh, nice, Deac, accuse the Asian
of having a gambling problem.

03:01.964 --> 03:03.313
So a couple grand, huh?

03:03.357 --> 03:05.837
Hey, me, Luca and Tan
were just private citizens

03:05.881 --> 03:07.317
enjoying the scenery,

03:07.361 --> 03:10.233
maybe contributing
to the local economy.

03:10.277 --> 03:12.975
All right, so we've got enough
in the budget for this quarter

03:13.018 --> 03:14.716
for one new piece
of equipment.

03:14.759 --> 03:16.587
So let's, uh, test
these out in the field

03:16.631 --> 03:17.893
and may the best gear win.

03:17.936 --> 03:19.503
All right.

03:19.547 --> 03:20.765
Trisha.

03:20.809 --> 03:22.332
Hey. This is
Sergeant Kay.

03:22.376 --> 03:24.595
Sergeant.Hi.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.597
Thank you so much for the
opportunity to have LAPD SWAT

03:26.641 --> 03:27.946
test our newest NVGs.

03:27.990 --> 03:29.644
Where's Luca?

03:29.687 --> 03:31.820
Luca is in San Francisco seeing
a specialist for a hip injury.

03:31.863 --> 03:34.257
He reinjured it
a few weeks back.

03:34.301 --> 03:36.172
We talked about getting drinks
while I was in town.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.218
I'll have to text him,
see how he's doing.

03:38.261 --> 03:41.090
I'm sure he'd love to hear
from you. So, Trisha,

03:41.133 --> 03:43.135
why don't you tell me
what sets your NVGs apart

03:43.179 --> 03:45.007
from the ones we currently use
in the field.

03:45.050 --> 03:46.487
Well, these
are the first

03:46.530 --> 03:49.533
night-vision goggles combined
with thermal imagery,

03:49.577 --> 03:52.144
giving the wearer
a 360-degree view.

03:52.188 --> 03:54.712
They basically give you eyes
in the back of your head.

04:02.633 --> 04:04.113
You got me.

04:04.156 --> 04:06.420
Nice.

04:08.422 --> 04:11.990
Well, color me impressed.

04:12.034 --> 04:13.818
Our refracting mirror technology
is ten times better

04:13.862 --> 04:15.429
than any NVG
on the market.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.257
All right, well, we'll, uh,
we'll test it out in the field

04:17.300 --> 04:19.171
and get back to you.Can't wait to hear
what you think.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.609
[phones chiming]Oh.

04:21.652 --> 04:24.089
What's happening, Commander?

04:24.133 --> 04:26.657
This is Sergeant Ben Sikora,
LAPD Organized Crime.

04:26.701 --> 04:28.311
He's got a code red situation

04:28.355 --> 04:31.314
involving one of his officers
working undercover.

04:31.358 --> 04:32.924
At approximately
0030 this morning,

04:32.968 --> 04:34.839
one of my undercover
officers, Ava Ilic,

04:34.883 --> 04:37.407
met with suspects who run
a sex trafficking ring

04:37.451 --> 04:39.279
and disappeared.HONDO: What about surveillance?

04:39.322 --> 04:41.106
Anyone from your team
got eyes on her?

04:41.150 --> 04:42.760
Ava got a call from
one of the suspects

04:42.804 --> 04:43.979
requesting a
last-minute meeting.

04:44.022 --> 04:45.328
She called me en route
to a brothel

04:45.372 --> 04:47.591
located in Echo Park,

04:47.635 --> 04:48.940
but she never sent me
the address.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.507
Any pings
from her phone?
Zero.

04:50.551 --> 04:53.336
Ava's cell and her secret
recording device both went dark

04:53.380 --> 04:56.034
at the exact same time this crew
ditched all their cell phones.

04:56.078 --> 04:57.862
Who is the crew?

04:57.906 --> 05:00.038
HICKS: Jakob Varga. Got a
long list of felony priors.

05:00.082 --> 05:01.692
He's the top dog
of a pack

05:01.736 --> 05:04.521
of Hungarians. Organized Crime's
been after him for six months.

05:04.565 --> 05:06.697
Laszlo Kithclo.

05:06.741 --> 05:09.352
Dragan Vilic. Zeno Noche.

05:09.396 --> 05:11.136
These are
Varga's enforcers.

05:11.180 --> 05:12.877
Known on the streets
as "Bal Kez,"

05:12.921 --> 05:15.053
which in Hungarian means
"the left hands."

05:15.097 --> 05:16.533
In certain verses of the Bible,
the left hand

05:16.577 --> 05:17.926
is considered to be
the evil hand.

05:17.969 --> 05:20.058
And believe me,
these guys live up to the name.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.669
HICKS:
Varga's boys

05:21.712 --> 05:23.932
are mainly known for moving
high quantities of club drugs.

05:23.975 --> 05:26.282
A year ago, Organized Crime
received intel

05:26.326 --> 05:28.893
that they extended their
operation into sex-trafficking

05:28.937 --> 05:31.156
teenage, even preteen girls.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.941
How long has Ava
been undercover?SIKORA: Three months.

05:32.984 --> 05:36.553
Ava's Serbian-- she's got the
look, she knows the language.

05:36.597 --> 05:38.033
We had her posing as a madam

05:38.076 --> 05:39.687
looking to buy some girls
to start her own brothel.

05:39.730 --> 05:42.298
And you got some of your team
sitting on the Hungarian LKAs?

05:42.342 --> 05:44.561
Yeah, but so far, no sign
of Varga or his soldiers.

05:44.605 --> 05:46.476
All right,
where do we start?

05:46.520 --> 05:48.086
This is my surveillance log.

05:48.130 --> 05:49.827
It's a list of bars
and clubs Bal Kez

05:49.871 --> 05:52.787
either runs or is known
to frequent.All right.

05:52.830 --> 05:55.137
Let's suit up, start blasting
off hinges until we find her.

05:56.834 --> 05:58.836
Becker, thanks for
filling in for Luca.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.099
My pleasure.
Hope he's better soon.

06:01.143 --> 06:02.971
That makes all of us.

06:03.014 --> 06:06.453
First place we hit is Fero's.
It's a hipster dive in Los Feliz

06:06.496 --> 06:08.280
that Varga called
before he dumped his phone.

06:08.324 --> 06:10.892
Intel shows Varga's a silent
partner in the bar where Bal Kez

06:10.935 --> 06:12.850
sells bad cocaine
and counterfeit Gucci bags.

06:12.894 --> 06:15.026
I've chased a lot
of Eastern European crews,

06:15.070 --> 06:17.333
but this outfit is the most
vicious I've ever seen.

06:17.377 --> 06:19.379
I don't want to imagine
what they're doing to Ava

06:19.422 --> 06:20.945
if her cover's blown.

06:20.989 --> 06:22.599
You can ask these guys
and they'll tell you,

06:22.643 --> 06:24.166
I don't go
preaching at work,

06:24.209 --> 06:26.690
but I don't think it's in
God's plan to let Ava die today.

06:26.734 --> 06:28.344
I haven't been to church
in years,

06:28.388 --> 06:30.868
but if we get Ava back,
I'll join your parish's choir.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.740
Ava's parents
are heading down here.

06:32.783 --> 06:34.698
I need a point person
to act as liaison.

06:36.483 --> 06:39.137
Sir, I can handle the parents.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.530
Excellent. Thanks, Alonso.

06:43.403 --> 06:46.536
Volunteering for bad news duty,
that's pretty righteous of you.

06:51.498 --> 06:52.542
[tires screech]

06:54.544 --> 06:57.460
LAPD Vice has raided
this bar before.

06:57.504 --> 06:58.505
According to
their report,

06:58.548 --> 07:00.550
it's got reinforced
steel doors.

07:02.204 --> 07:04.075
Damn, what's that?It's called a "door-blower,"

07:04.119 --> 07:05.337
straight from
the SHOT Show, baby.

07:05.381 --> 07:07.514
Let's go.Wait till you see what it does.

07:09.646 --> 07:10.865
Street, you're up.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.086
Ready to rock, Hondo.HONDO: Go.

07:16.348 --> 07:18.176
LAPD!

07:18.220 --> 07:20.178
You drop that bag!

07:20.222 --> 07:22.180
We've got a warrant.Right side clear.

07:23.573 --> 07:26.228
Jakob Varga. Where is he?

07:26.271 --> 07:27.534
I just run the bar.

07:27.577 --> 07:30.493
[whistles] Got to be
at least 200 grand here.

07:30.537 --> 07:33.627
Your tips? Must be mixing
the baddest drinks in town.

07:33.670 --> 07:35.498
Okay, listen, full disclosure,

07:35.542 --> 07:37.500
Varga called me,
said get the cash from the safe

07:37.544 --> 07:39.371
and get it ready for Danika
to pick up.

07:39.415 --> 07:40.851
Who's Danika?His girlfriend.

07:40.895 --> 07:42.244
All right, she should
be here any minute.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.550
No sign of Ava.

07:43.593 --> 07:46.161
All right, let's lose
the rigs outside.

07:46.204 --> 07:47.902
We're expecting
a visitor.

07:48.903 --> 07:50.426
PILOT:
Be advised,

07:50.470 --> 07:52.080
suspect approaching the bar now.

07:54.691 --> 07:56.388
LAPD!

07:56.432 --> 07:59.435
Turn off the vehicle,
place your hands on the dash!

07:59.479 --> 08:01.698
Lady, turn off the car!

08:03.744 --> 08:05.093
Tires!

08:13.275 --> 08:16.365
Keep your hands on
the wheel! Deacon, go.

08:16.408 --> 08:18.976
Out of the car,
out of the car.

08:19.020 --> 08:20.543
Let's go.

08:20.587 --> 08:23.938
Where's Jakob Varga?[muffled shouting]

08:23.981 --> 08:26.201
Ava?

08:28.290 --> 08:30.379
[girl speaking Bulgarian]

08:30.422 --> 08:32.424
[Sikora speaks Bulgarian]

08:32.468 --> 08:34.731
It's okay, it's okay.
You're safe.

08:34.775 --> 08:38.430
I got you.
I got you, come on.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.476
I got you, I got you.[speaking Bulgarian]

08:42.609 --> 08:44.001
What's she saying?

08:44.045 --> 08:46.351
"Thank God
for sending you."

08:50.747 --> 08:52.749
â™ª

09:28.263 --> 09:29.656
Danika Dibra.

09:29.699 --> 09:31.396
Undocumented immigrant
from Albania.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.834
According to Organized Crime,

09:33.877 --> 09:36.706
you're Varga's
number one girl,

09:36.750 --> 09:38.621
and we caught you trying
to pick up a bag of cash

09:38.665 --> 09:40.057
so you could
split town together.

09:41.624 --> 09:43.495
What about that girl
tied up in your trunk?

09:43.539 --> 09:45.889
No sympathy for her
or the others Varga sells

09:45.933 --> 09:47.238
as sex slaves?

09:47.282 --> 09:51.721
Jakob took me from my village
when I was 15.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.376
Five years, I worked
in one of his brothels.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.726
Was I sad?

09:56.770 --> 10:00.817
No. I wanted to be
his best earner,

10:00.861 --> 10:03.515
his most beautiful,

10:03.559 --> 10:04.908
and I was.

10:04.952 --> 10:07.607
A year ago,
he took me off my back

10:07.650 --> 10:09.609
and put me
by his side.

10:09.652 --> 10:11.219
Back in my village,

10:11.262 --> 10:13.569
I had nothing.

10:13.613 --> 10:16.398
Now I have a condo,

10:16.441 --> 10:19.575
nice clothes, drive a Maserati.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.926
Thanks to him, you're about to
be living in a ten-by-ten cell.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.407
You don't owe him anything.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.410
[laughs softly]

10:28.453 --> 10:32.762
The girl in my trunk,
she's better off here.

10:32.806 --> 10:34.634
Just like I was.

10:38.289 --> 10:40.117
Her name's Juliana.

10:40.161 --> 10:42.903
She was snatched from her
village in Bulgaria a month ago.

10:42.946 --> 10:44.208
Smuggled over
in a shipping container

10:44.252 --> 10:45.427
with three other girls.

10:45.470 --> 10:46.646
How old is she?

10:46.689 --> 10:49.736
15. The others were 14.

10:50.998 --> 10:53.304
Does she have any idea
where Varga is?

10:53.348 --> 10:55.132
Or remember any
place they took her?

11:09.016 --> 11:11.801
She was blindfolded and moved
around in the trunks of cars.

11:11.845 --> 11:14.021
She doesn't
have a clue.

11:15.239 --> 11:16.588
WENDY:
She's suffering from PTSD.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.199
With everything
she's been through,

11:18.242 --> 11:19.504
it's no wonder.

11:19.548 --> 11:21.550
We need to get her to a hospital
for a rape kit,

[Sikora speaking Bulgarian]

11:30.211 --> 11:32.692
I told her to go
with you, to the doctor.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.739
[quietly]:
No. You keep it.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.568
And what's gonna happen to her?

11:39.611 --> 11:42.005
Because she's an undocumented
minor, I have to alert

11:42.049 --> 11:43.572
Social Services.

11:46.749 --> 11:48.272
Anything out
of Varga's girlfriend?

11:48.316 --> 11:50.361
Besides her demented take
on the American Dream? No.

11:50.405 --> 11:51.885
But we found something
in her purse.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.365
It's a barbershop in Echo Park
owned by Jovan Balic,

Belgrade 20 years ago.

Belongs to a burner phone
that was deactivated

12:01.677 --> 12:04.245
right after Ava disappeared.What do the words mean?

12:05.463 --> 12:06.856
"Virgin skin, good prices."

When Ava last called you,
she said

12:13.036 --> 12:15.430
she was meeting Varga
and his crew at Echo Park.

12:15.473 --> 12:16.910
I bet that barbershop's
just a brothel

12:16.953 --> 12:19.303
for Varga to
supply girls to.

12:19.347 --> 12:20.478
You know the place?

Ava. Do you have any news?

We haven't located her yet,

12:42.849 --> 12:44.415
who we're hoping can point us
in the right direction.

12:44.459 --> 12:46.026
We knew Ava worked undercover,

12:46.069 --> 12:48.550

safeguards in place.

the police,

13:10.137 --> 13:11.660
it wasn't exactly the career

13:11.703 --> 13:14.141
we pictured for her.

13:14.184 --> 13:16.578
But we supported her.

13:16.621 --> 13:18.275
Just wish she would've told us

13:18.319 --> 13:20.800
how dangerous
this job really was.

undercover operations

first time undercover.

the calls to keep her safe.

she could handle it,

18:11.438 --> 18:12.439
you would've called off
the meet.

18:12.482 --> 18:16.747

18:16.791 --> 18:19.968

And then when she called me,
I-I should've,

to turn around.

joined my team,

18:38.204 --> 18:40.858
he went undercover
to bust a crew of car thieves.

18:40.902 --> 18:42.469
We lost him for a while.

18:42.512 --> 18:46.255
Just like Ava,
all his comms went dark.

18:46.299 --> 18:47.474
What happened?

18:47.517 --> 18:50.041
We barely got his ass back.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.653
But I waited
until we got Street back safely

18:52.696 --> 18:54.611

about it.

back in the game,

barbershop, how are they doing?

19:14.457 --> 19:15.676
Physically, they'll heal fine.

into trunks with bags of coffee

being transported.

the brothel earlier?

19:35.522 --> 19:38.002
Yeah. Yeah, he posted bail
about a half hour ago. Why?

19:38.046 --> 19:39.526
Well, we just got a call.
There's a barricade situation

19:39.569 --> 19:40.788
at his home.

about my daughter?

No, no. But she told me once
that Varga

20:21.959 --> 20:24.092
took off her blindfold
somewhere in a back room

20:24.135 --> 20:26.268

grinding coffee

You haven't found Ava.
Maybe I can.

George, we've got new intel
on Ava's whereabouts.

20:51.032 --> 20:52.294

you're just slowing us down

would have known

21:47.784 --> 21:49.786
about the Hungarians'
involvement

21:49.830 --> 21:51.614
is if you told him.
Am I wrong?

21:51.658 --> 21:53.921
George happened to see Petavich
when we hauled him in.

21:53.964 --> 21:56.358
And when he saw him,
he asked if he was responsible

21:56.402 --> 21:58.317
for his daughter's
disappearance.

21:59.666 --> 22:03.147
Maybe he saw it on my face.Damn it!

22:03.191 --> 22:04.888
What were you thinking?I wasn't gonna lie to him.

22:04.932 --> 22:08.022
I mean, what if it was one of
your kids who was kidnapped?

22:08.065 --> 22:09.980
Wouldn't you want to know
who was responsible?

22:10.024 --> 22:12.983
Don't throw hypotheticals at me.
You screwed up.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.333
Then punish me.

22:14.376 --> 22:15.986
Not Ava's dad.
Please.

22:16.030 --> 22:17.553
It's too late for that now.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.731
If you read my jacket, you know
my mom died when I was 13.

22:21.775 --> 22:24.691
I know every word
in your jacket.

22:24.734 --> 22:27.737
Your mother was killed
in an accident on the 5 Freeway.

22:27.781 --> 22:31.132
I'm sorry, but what does that
have to do with this?

22:32.960 --> 22:35.266
When I was in the seventh grade,
a cop pulled me out of class

22:35.310 --> 22:37.573
and drove me down
to Hollenbeck Station.

22:37.617 --> 22:42.404
He parked me on a bench,
where I waited for an hour.

22:42.448 --> 22:44.493
Then these two other officers
were walking by,

22:44.537 --> 22:47.714
talking about a woman who got
turned into highway hamburger.

22:47.757 --> 22:50.064
Oh, geez...
Laughing about
how sorry they felt

22:50.107 --> 22:53.720
for the Caltrans team who had
to scrape her off the road.

22:57.724 --> 23:00.161
Then they finally noticed me
and asked me for my name.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.730
When I told them Alonso,

23:03.773 --> 23:06.036
they could barely
look me in the eyes

23:06.080 --> 23:08.169
when they told me
it was my mom who died.

23:10.737 --> 23:13.217
It's a shame you had to
hear it that way.

23:13.261 --> 23:15.524
When I became police,
I swore nothing like that

23:15.568 --> 23:17.874
would ever happen on my watch.

23:17.918 --> 23:20.137
I was just trying to be honest

23:20.181 --> 23:23.227
and respectful to Ava's parents.

23:26.753 --> 23:29.190
All right, yeah, it's...

23:30.409 --> 23:31.497
Get back to the team.

23:34.543 --> 23:36.589
And let's bring Ava back alive.

23:42.986 --> 23:44.335
What's with the history books?

23:44.379 --> 23:46.468
So we found coffee
in Danika's trunk.

23:46.512 --> 23:48.427
The Serbian girls
then told Dr. Wendy

23:48.470 --> 23:51.038
something about laying
on bags of coffee.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.169
And then Petavich
admitted that

23:52.213 --> 23:53.562
the girl he visited
in the brothel

23:53.606 --> 23:55.695
met an old Hungarian man
who was grinding coffee.

23:55.738 --> 23:57.914
So we got to thinking there's
got to be a connection, right?

23:57.958 --> 24:00.351
We started digging
and found this guy.

24:00.395 --> 24:03.137
Anton Boros. Came over
from Hungary in '79

24:03.180 --> 24:05.748
after being released from prison
for killing a business rival.

24:05.792 --> 24:09.622
Boros... he was a nasty piece
of work back in the day.

24:09.665 --> 24:12.712
Considered the Hungarian
godfather of L.A.

24:12.755 --> 24:14.757
He's been off LAPD's radar
for a decade.

24:14.801 --> 24:16.455
Organized Crime never
got enough to indict him.

24:16.498 --> 24:18.239
Assumed he was inactive.

24:18.282 --> 24:20.894
A gangster who happily retired?
That doesn't happen very often.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.548
What's Boros up to now?

24:22.591 --> 24:24.811
He owns a cafÃ©
in Echo Park,

24:24.854 --> 24:27.596
specializing in
Hungarian coffee.

24:27.640 --> 24:30.556
So Boros isn't as retired
as everyone thought.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.645
[speaking Hungarian]

24:34.995 --> 24:37.606
LAPD SWAT, ma'am.
He's closed.

24:40.043 --> 24:41.436
You ever seen her?

24:41.480 --> 24:43.133
Never.

24:43.177 --> 24:45.658
What's your relationship
to Bal Kez, Jakob Varga?

24:45.701 --> 24:47.094
Are you helping them
smuggle underage girls here

24:47.137 --> 24:49.531
from the old country?You have the wrong person.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.316
I'm running a cafÃ©.Yeah?

24:52.360 --> 24:54.449
Then what's this bad boy for?

24:54.493 --> 24:58.366
Security system.Her name is Ava Ilic.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.324
She disappeared yesterday, and
we think that Varga and his boys

25:00.368 --> 25:01.456
are keeping her hostage.

25:01.500 --> 25:03.327
Ilic.

25:03.371 --> 25:05.808
Serbian, hmm?

25:05.852 --> 25:07.331
Well, I'm sorry
for her family,

25:07.375 --> 25:09.899
but I have no idea what
you're talking about.

25:09.943 --> 25:11.553
All the years that you
outsmarted the cops

25:11.597 --> 25:13.555
and never spent a night in jail.

25:13.599 --> 25:15.818
It'd be a damn shame if you
spent the last years

25:15.862 --> 25:18.429
of your life in prison
for somebody else's crimes.

25:23.434 --> 25:28.135
If I tell you all I know
about Jakob Varga,

25:28.178 --> 25:29.397
I won't be arrested?

25:29.440 --> 25:31.094
Deal of a lifetime.

25:34.141 --> 25:37.405
I am not part of Bal Kez.

25:37.448 --> 25:41.714
I-I supply the coffee
to mask the smell,

25:41.757 --> 25:43.803
so the girls don't know
where they're coming from.

25:43.846 --> 25:44.804
And where's that?

25:44.847 --> 25:45.892
The Salton Sea.

25:45.935 --> 25:47.807
Alkaline beds.

25:47.850 --> 25:49.548
Dead fish.

25:49.591 --> 25:50.853
Is Ava there?
Is she still alive?

25:50.897 --> 25:52.463
BOROS:
I don't know,

25:52.507 --> 25:56.206
but a girl so pretty,

25:56.250 --> 25:58.382
he wouldn't just
throw her away.

25:58.426 --> 26:01.995
No. She's too valuable.

26:02.038 --> 26:03.474
This is 20-David to Command.

26:03.518 --> 26:04.998
Tell air support
we need the hawk ready to fly.

26:10.873 --> 26:12.962
STREET:
The Salton Sea.

26:13.006 --> 26:15.095
Thought all they had here

26:15.138 --> 26:17.010
was hippie burnouts
and meth heads.

26:17.053 --> 26:18.359
That and Coachella.BECKER:
I'm telling you guys,

26:18.402 --> 26:20.840
the Sea's got
nothing but bad juju.

26:20.883 --> 26:23.016
I didn't take you for
the superstitious type, Becker.

26:26.236 --> 26:29.849
DEACON:
All right, Boros owns ten acres
in an area called Bombay Beach.

26:29.892 --> 26:31.372
It's an old resort
turned ghost town.

26:31.415 --> 26:33.330
Barely any residents
or police presence.

26:33.374 --> 26:35.332
There's dozens of abandoned
buildings on the property.

26:35.376 --> 26:37.552
Varga and his boys could be
holding Ava in any one of them.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.772
So we're gonna touch down
a half mile out, move in on foot

26:39.815 --> 26:41.861
and then we take
them by surprise.

26:41.904 --> 26:43.253
Who's game for 360 NVGs?

26:45.038 --> 26:47.562
Deac?

26:49.738 --> 26:51.740
We're passing over the
Salton Sea now, Sergeant.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.712
VARGA:
Miklos is coming
from Vegas.

27:06.755 --> 27:08.975
He's got a new
underground club.

27:09.018 --> 27:11.107
Gonna buy all three
for a cut-rate.

27:13.109 --> 27:15.459
I threw the snitch in for free.

27:15.503 --> 27:17.505
[grunts]

27:21.117 --> 27:23.946
We got to make you
look presentable.

27:25.165 --> 27:27.167
The plane is all set?

27:29.212 --> 27:32.302
We leave at midnight.
Private charter.

27:32.346 --> 27:35.828
Palm Springs to Vancouver,
then to Budapest.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.537
Sheriff Perry.

27:49.580 --> 27:52.671
I appreciate the welcome to your
turf and y'all having our backs.

27:52.714 --> 27:54.107
Pleasure's mine,
Sergeant.

27:54.150 --> 27:55.935
Only one main road
in and out of here.

27:55.978 --> 27:57.937
I got deputies
stationed on both ends.

27:57.980 --> 27:59.721
That's good to know.

27:59.765 --> 28:02.942
I'll hit you on the radio as
soon as we locate the suspects.

28:02.985 --> 28:04.770
Calvary's waiting,
hammers cocked.

28:04.813 --> 28:06.510
All right, let's move!

28:18.958 --> 28:20.263
Deacon, you and Stevens
take the east.

28:20.307 --> 28:21.743
Tan, you and Becker south.

28:21.787 --> 28:24.224
Me, Street and Sikora
will search the north.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.795
We don't want them
to know we're coming,

28:29.838 --> 28:32.623
so use your NVGs
instead of tac-lights.

28:39.718 --> 28:41.763
Everybody set?Set.

28:41.807 --> 28:43.765
Let's get it done.

28:56.212 --> 28:58.040
Sikora, cover right.

29:00.564 --> 29:02.262
Engine's still warm.HONDO: Check the plates.

29:08.224 --> 29:09.704
Hondo.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.575
Registered

29:11.619 --> 29:12.751
Street, cover me.

29:17.364 --> 29:19.322
[air hissing]

29:19.366 --> 29:22.151
Deac and Tan, we got possible
location of the suspects.

29:22.195 --> 29:24.197
The Low Dive bar.
Requesting backup.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.330
Street, take the three side.
Me and Sikora got the one.

29:27.374 --> 29:28.462
Sikora, let's go.

29:42.432 --> 29:44.434
Get the converters.

29:47.481 --> 29:48.917
26-David, on the three side.

29:50.832 --> 29:53.095
[grunts]

29:57.796 --> 30:01.016
If those are cops, they'll have
to shoot through you.

30:01.060 --> 30:02.931
[muffled]:
No! No!

30:02.975 --> 30:04.063
Ava!

30:04.106 --> 30:05.455
What are you doing? Get back!

30:07.849 --> 30:09.764
We got shots fired!DEACON: On our way, Hondo.

30:11.679 --> 30:14.638
Street, you got any movement
on the three side?

30:14.682 --> 30:15.857
Negative, Hondo.

30:15.901 --> 30:17.903
LAPD!

30:17.946 --> 30:20.688
Right side clear!Left side clear!

[speaking Bulgarian]

30:28.261 --> 30:29.697
Hondo...

30:34.180 --> 30:36.138
26-David, I've got eyes

30:36.182 --> 30:38.401
on four male suspects
and a female

30:38.445 --> 30:40.447
coming out an escape hatch
50 yards out,

30:40.490 --> 30:41.578
splitting up in all directions.

30:41.622 --> 30:42.666
Those shots were
just a diversion.

30:42.710 --> 30:43.842
They took Ava.
Sergeant,

30:43.885 --> 30:45.408
I need you to stay
with the girls

30:45.452 --> 30:46.670
in case
they circle back.

30:46.714 --> 30:49.151
The rest of us, fan out.
Let's find them.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.286
â™ª

30:54.722 --> 30:57.856
LAPD! Drop your weapon!

30:57.899 --> 30:59.379
We got shots fired!

31:04.993 --> 31:07.082
DEACON:
Keep your tac-lights off.
We don't want to be targets.

31:07.126 --> 31:09.693
Tan, Becker, you take
suspect one left side.

31:09.737 --> 31:12.871
Stevens, you're with me
on the right side.

31:21.880 --> 31:23.272
Becker, I've got a runner.

31:24.970 --> 31:26.928
LAPD! Drop
your weapon!

31:44.903 --> 31:45.991

30-David, suspect down.

32:14.497 --> 32:15.498
Cover!

32:21.591 --> 32:23.985
Two suspects sighted
on the west end.

32:24.029 --> 32:25.204
Varga's got Ava.

32:25.247 --> 32:27.467
Street, you're on Dragan--
he went right.

32:27.510 --> 32:29.338
I'm on Varga, move!Got 'em.

George, they found her.

35:01.577 --> 35:03.666
Please tell me.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.233
Ava's safe and is
being medevacked

35:05.277 --> 35:06.539
to a hospital as we speak.

35:06.582 --> 35:08.715
Thank God.

35:14.199 --> 35:17.245
Sorry, but you have to be taken
to men's central and booked.

35:18.681 --> 35:19.943
I'm gonna do everything
I can to help.

35:22.685 --> 35:26.341
At least my daughter
is alive.

Thank you.

Hondo, you and your team
did one hell of a deed

36:42.243 --> 36:43.288
out there tonight.

36:43.331 --> 36:45.246
Pleasure's ours, sir.

36:45.290 --> 36:47.117
Out of all the gear
we tried out in the field,

36:47.161 --> 36:48.945
these are the winners.

36:48.989 --> 36:50.904
I'll call Trisha, tell her
we're gonna put in an order.

36:50.947 --> 36:52.949
Big sale to SWAT--
bet Trisha rewards Luca

36:52.993 --> 36:54.386
big-time when they
go on that date.

36:54.429 --> 36:57.519
Well, speaking of Luca,
the specialist up

36:57.563 --> 37:00.305
in San Francisco said it's not
just his hip-- he's having

37:00.348 --> 37:02.785
complications with his back, so
they're gonna have to keep him

37:02.829 --> 37:04.265
up there a
while longer.

37:04.309 --> 37:05.353
How much longer?

37:05.397 --> 37:07.355
Well, I don't know.

37:07.399 --> 37:08.922
Depends on
the results.

37:11.751 --> 37:13.796
All right, listen up.

37:13.840 --> 37:16.190
We all reach out to Luca,
and we show him some love.

37:21.326 --> 37:23.632
Deac, next time
you talk to God,

37:23.676 --> 37:25.721
tell him I appreciated
the help.
[chuckles]

37:25.765 --> 37:27.636
Hey, listen, there's
choir practice at my parish

37:27.680 --> 37:29.290
every Saturday at 5:30.

37:29.334 --> 37:31.814
I can't sing a lick,
don't think you'd want me.

37:31.858 --> 37:33.816
How about
a cold beer, then?

37:33.860 --> 37:37.167
I wish I could, but some of us
have more paperwork than others.

37:37.211 --> 37:38.995
Understood.

37:39.039 --> 37:41.041
Pleasure working with you.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.174
Alonso!

37:44.218 --> 37:46.307
Commander.

37:46.351 --> 37:48.570
The odds of getting Ava back
alive weren't in her favor.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.703
How's she doing?
Good.

37:50.746 --> 37:52.705
Considering what she's
been through.
Good.

37:52.748 --> 37:54.228
I just got back
from the hospital.

37:54.272 --> 37:56.317
Her mom's by her side.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.450
I wish her dad was, too.

37:58.493 --> 38:00.539
George Ilic used a gun
to take a man hostage.

38:00.582 --> 38:02.367
That hostage had
sex numerous times

38:02.410 --> 38:03.977
with underage girls
brought to this country

38:04.020 --> 38:05.631
in shipping containers.

38:05.674 --> 38:07.676
The D.A. won't just
sweep this under the rug.

38:07.720 --> 38:09.504
Sir, regardless
of what happened,

38:09.548 --> 38:11.158
I'm still an advocate
for Ava's family.

38:11.201 --> 38:14.161
Assistant District Attorney
Kemper is handling

38:14.204 --> 38:15.989
the charges
against Ava's father.

38:16.032 --> 38:19.645
Now, I phoned and suggested they
be dropped down to misdemeanors,

38:19.688 --> 38:21.995
but Kemper didn't seem
too willing to budge.

38:22.038 --> 38:24.911
Maybe you can convince him.

38:26.304 --> 38:28.044
Thanks.

38:32.875 --> 38:35.008
Should we be worried
about Luca?

38:35.051 --> 38:36.488
Nah, he'll be back
in no time.

38:36.531 --> 38:38.490
Guy's indestructible.

38:38.533 --> 38:41.188
Listen, for you
guys at your age,

38:41.231 --> 38:42.842
it's easy to take a hit
and jump right back,

38:42.885 --> 38:45.497
but for the rest of us...

38:45.540 --> 38:46.889
What, are you
"Old Man Deacon" now?

38:46.933 --> 38:48.064
Nah, I'm just saying.

38:48.108 --> 38:50.197
Once you hit 35,

38:50.240 --> 38:53.374
it gets harder and harder
to bounce back, that's all.

38:53.418 --> 38:57.291
Those little aches and pains
that you used to laugh off?

38:57.335 --> 38:59.249
Now they got you
limping for a week.

38:59.293 --> 39:01.382
Oh, come on, Deac, we
know you and Luca both

39:01.426 --> 39:02.862
got a couple more
decades in you.

39:02.905 --> 39:04.254
[laughs softly]

39:04.298 --> 39:05.865
Nah, the only thing
I know is that there's

39:05.908 --> 39:07.954
an expiration date
for all us doing this job.

39:07.997 --> 39:09.738
And sometimes,

39:09.782 --> 39:12.132
you see the end coming straight
at you and sometimes...

39:12.175 --> 39:14.961
it sneaks up on your six.

39:21.881 --> 39:24.318
Thought you went home
and crashed.

39:24.362 --> 39:27.408
Nah, I had some paperwork
I had to finish up.

39:27.452 --> 39:30.106
More responsibility,
more work.

39:30.150 --> 39:31.891
I feel you.

39:31.934 --> 39:33.675
Be careful what you
wish for, right?

39:33.719 --> 39:35.155
[laughs]
Yeah...

39:35.198 --> 39:36.809
Listen, I hope
after all of this,

39:36.852 --> 39:39.115
you take some vacation days,
get your head right.

39:39.159 --> 39:41.335
I already put in
for six weeks.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.642
I haven't taken leave for years,
but my wife's always

39:43.685 --> 39:45.687
wanted to rent an RV,
head across country.

39:45.731 --> 39:47.341
[chuckles]

39:47.385 --> 39:49.343
Hey, listen, man.

39:51.040 --> 39:52.085
Thank you.

39:52.128 --> 39:53.303
Nah, come on, man.

39:53.347 --> 39:54.783
Getting Ava back
was a team effort.

39:54.827 --> 39:55.784
No.

39:55.828 --> 39:57.917
I mean for your honesty.

39:57.960 --> 39:59.745
I've done countless

39:59.788 --> 40:03.401
undercover missions
and I never once cracked.

40:03.444 --> 40:05.446
I was in a dark place.

40:05.490 --> 40:08.101
But your words...

40:08.144 --> 40:11.452
well, they got me through it.

40:11.496 --> 40:14.760
As team leaders, sometimes
we got to be reminded

40:14.803 --> 40:17.632
that the weight of the world
isn't always on our shoulders.

40:17.676 --> 40:20.243
We got brothers
and sisters to count on.

40:20.287 --> 40:22.420
Amen.
