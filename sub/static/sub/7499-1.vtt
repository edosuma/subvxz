02:00.503 --> 02:02.061
- What a laugh.
- Yeah?

02:02.138 --> 02:05.369
- Yeah, it doesn't mean a thing.
- They laughed at Edison, too.

02:05.441 --> 02:07.500
Looks like I'm an assistant
to a guy out of a job.

02:07.577 --> 02:09.738
You remember when mahjong
was popular, don't you, Harry?

02:09.812 --> 02:11.212
- So what?
- It's a fad.

02:11.281 --> 02:13.579
I've staged 50 musical comedies
and I'll stage 50 more.

02:13.650 --> 02:14.639
I hope you're right.

02:14.717 --> 02:17.015
Frazer and Gould are putting
<i>Never Say No</i> into rehearsal...

02:17.086 --> 02:18.280
and I'm doing the numbers.

02:18.354 --> 02:21.790
- Am I going with you?
- Lf they don't run out of ink. Let's go.

02:31.801 --> 02:33.530
- Hiya, Kent.
- Hello, boys.

02:33.603 --> 02:35.230
When does <i>Never Say No</i>
go into rehearsal?

02:35.305 --> 02:38.103
Chester, it don't. You can't give
the public what they don't want.

02:38.174 --> 02:41.143
- What show are you gonna do?
- No show if we're in our right mind.

02:41.211 --> 02:44.339
People ain't paying for shows no more.
Talking pictures is what they want.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.642
So, it don't mean a thing, huh?

02:45.715 --> 02:48.343
Plays is a dead issue.
We're in the picture business, exhibitors.

02:48.418 --> 02:49.749
Yeah, we just bought four houses.

02:49.819 --> 02:53.516
They deliver the show in tin cans
and we got nothing to worry about.

02:55.225 --> 02:56.419
So musicals are out, huh?

02:56.492 --> 02:58.653
Yeah, come on around the corner
and I'll show you why.

02:58.728 --> 03:02.164
Yeah, come on around the corner
and I'll show you why.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.869
There's the answer.

03:11.941 --> 03:15.240
It's a lot better to fill your theater
10 times a day at 40 cents a ticket...

03:15.311 --> 03:18.337
than to charge $5 a seat
and have it half-filled once a night.

03:18.414 --> 03:21.144
- Yeah, if you're lucky.
- Come on, I'll show you.

03:22.685 --> 03:24.175
Won't last.

03:25.088 --> 03:27.249
<i>Excuse me, Zeke, offical busness.</i>

03:29.392 --> 03:33.624
<i>From now on, he'll be gettng plenty</i>
<i>of orders, but they won't all be by wre.</i>

03:33.696 --> 03:36.790
- Here's your answer.
- Oh, well, no matter.

03:37.133 --> 03:38.862
<i>I'm so proud of you, John.</i>

04:00.423 --> 04:02.584
So, you're in the picture business, hey, Si?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.650
Who's that, Whistler's mother?

04:04.727 --> 04:07.127
There's competition.
We're booking a house down the street.

04:07.196 --> 04:09.255
So we give them a little prologue
to fit the picture.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.765
What's the picture, <i>Uncle Tom 's Cabn?</i>

04:10.833 --> 04:12.357
We're showing <i>Slaves of the Desert.</i>

04:12.435 --> 04:14.665
So we put on something oriental
to fit the plot.

04:14.737 --> 04:16.932
That prologue wouldn't fit anything
but an ash can.

04:17.005 --> 04:19.497
Just the same,
it costs more than the picture.

04:19.575 --> 04:22.772
Say, why don't you let me put on
some of those prologues for you?

04:22.845 --> 04:25.814
- No, no. No more prologues.
- No more prologues, Chester.

04:25.882 --> 04:27.577
That oriental flesh is too expensive.

04:27.650 --> 04:31.916
After this, we're giving our customers
talking pictures and nothing else.

04:32.055 --> 04:35.286
Well, so long.
I gotta break the bad news to the wife.

04:35.625 --> 04:38.025
Red line, I hear you calling me.

04:38.761 --> 04:41.093
Public wants talking pictures
and talking pictures only.

04:41.164 --> 04:44.224
Listen, what you better do
is get yourself another job.

04:44.300 --> 04:46.461
Maybe I haven't made myself
understood, honey.

04:46.536 --> 04:49.004
They're not doing
any more musical shows.

04:49.072 --> 04:51.768
I always said they'd catch up with you.

04:51.941 --> 04:53.966
Is it my fault if somebody invented
talking pictures?

04:54.043 --> 04:56.671
I don't care whose fault it is.
It's time you earned some money.

04:56.746 --> 04:59.237
I'm used to good clothes
and everything that goes with it.

04:59.315 --> 05:02.182
- Well, haven't I always given you...
- Yeah. What goes with it.

05:02.251 --> 05:05.982
Listen, I'm fed up with you
and I have been for a long time.

05:07.056 --> 05:08.284
Well.

05:11.027 --> 05:13.860
- What shall we do about it?
- I'll show you.

05:17.066 --> 05:20.900
Here, sign that and I'll be
tickled to death to get a divorce.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.277
- You sure this is the way you want it?
- Absolutely.

05:37.253 --> 05:38.652
Well, that's that.

05:40.289 --> 05:42.223
Here's your aspirin, 18 cents.

05:42.558 --> 05:45.550
Say, how do you do it?
The place next door charges a quarter.

05:45.628 --> 05:48.290
Yeah, but he's on his own.
We got 100 stores.

05:48.364 --> 05:50.264
- What does that mean?
- We buy in big lots.

05:50.333 --> 05:52.324
When you're buying for one store,
you get soaked.

05:52.402 --> 05:53.596
When you're buying for 100...

05:53.669 --> 05:55.569
I see, practically name your own price.

05:55.638 --> 05:56.969
That's it.

05:57.507 --> 05:58.906
Say, that's marvelous.

05:58.975 --> 06:01.876
The chain store idea solves everything.
Thanks a million.

06:01.944 --> 06:05.573
- Hey, your aspirin!
- Take it yourself. My headache's gone.

06:06.816 --> 06:08.215
Come on, Al.

06:08.284 --> 06:10.548
Listen, boys, I just bought some aspirin.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.554
- Drunk again?
- No, listen to this, listen to this.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.147
When you've got one drugstore,
you charge 25 cents for aspirin.

06:15.224 --> 06:17.522
But when you're buying for 100 stores,
you get it for less.

06:17.593 --> 06:19.493
- So you sell it for 18 cents.
- So what?

06:19.562 --> 06:21.427
So your house, I mean,
your store is crowded.

06:21.497 --> 06:24.398
That's great, Chester, old boy.
That's a marvelous idea.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.832
Well, don't you get the connection?

06:25.902 --> 06:28.302
Yeah, we'll use it.
If we ever open a drugstore.

06:28.371 --> 06:31.306
No, listen. When you put on
one prologue, it's too expensive.

06:31.374 --> 06:33.842
But when the same prologue
plays 25, 50, 100 houses...

06:33.910 --> 06:35.502
it doesn't cost a cent more, get it?

06:35.578 --> 06:38.069
- We might have something there.
- Yeah?

06:38.848 --> 06:42.147
No, the same scenery, same costumes,
put them on once and they stay put on.

06:42.218 --> 06:43.617
But we've only got four theaters.

06:43.686 --> 06:45.517
Play them all over Chicago,
all over the country.

06:45.588 --> 06:48.421
Exhibitors everywhere will be tickled pink
to get ready-made prologues.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.515
- How do you know?
- It's a cinch.

06:49.592 --> 06:50.820
You can give them swell prologues...

06:50.893 --> 06:52.827
cheaper than they can
put them on themselves. Why?

06:52.895 --> 06:54.556
Because you're
in the chain store business.

06:54.630 --> 06:57.292
- Si, he's right.
- No question about it.

06:57.366 --> 07:00.233
Boys, your name'll be in lights
from the rock bottom coast of Maine...

07:00.303 --> 07:02.794
to the sunny strands of California.

07:14.150 --> 07:16.584
You'll have to wait a minute.
Will you take a seat, please?

07:16.652 --> 07:17.676
Good morning.

07:17.753 --> 07:20.950
- How about a job, Miss Prescott?
- See Arnold, the casting director.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.116
- Any mail?
- Nine out-of-town calls.

07:23.192 --> 07:25.183
Only nine? We must be slipping.

07:25.661 --> 07:27.060
- Hello.
- Good morning.

07:27.130 --> 07:29.598
- Is the boss in yet?
- I haven't seen Mr. Kent this morning.

07:29.665 --> 07:31.633
- Maybe you blinked and missed him?
- Possibly.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.191
- Hello, girls!
- Hello, Nan!

07:33.269 --> 07:37.137
- Mr. Gould wants to see Mr. Kent.
- Oh, I'll put that in my memory book.

07:40.576 --> 07:43.170
- Is Mr. Kent in?
- No, but I'm his secretary.

07:43.246 --> 07:46.682
- This is something very personal.
- That's the kind of a secretary I am.

07:47.683 --> 07:50.413
Well, you see, I'm a title-thinker-upper.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.749
Honest, I am.
My real business is insurance...

07:53.823 --> 07:56.189
but I have a lot of spare time
so I think up titles.

07:56.259 --> 07:59.626
- Right out of your head?
- Yes, here's some I thought up yesterday.

07:59.695 --> 08:03.426
"Girls of Spain, Girls of France,
Girls of South America"...

08:03.499 --> 08:04.761
Keep them under your hat.

08:04.834 --> 08:06.699
What do you do,
just travel around the world?

08:06.769 --> 08:07.793
That's right.

08:07.870 --> 08:10.270
Maybe you could use them for prologues.
I'll sell them cheap.

08:10.339 --> 08:12.136
Tell you what you do,
you go over to Gladstone.

08:12.208 --> 08:13.675
Sounds like his kind of stuff.

08:13.743 --> 08:16.041
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

08:23.352 --> 08:24.819
Here you are.

08:26.122 --> 08:28.420
- Cats!
- First drink that.

08:28.724 --> 08:31.784
Working all night again. I thought you said
you were going home early.

08:31.861 --> 08:33.419
I did go home, that is...

08:33.496 --> 08:36.590
I mean, I started to go home,
right after dress rehearsal, about 3:00 a.m.

08:36.666 --> 08:38.827
And then bingo! I got an idea. Cats!

08:38.900 --> 08:40.835
I was walking on the street
and saw some cats.

08:40.903 --> 08:43.063
You ever see cats walk? Just like that.

08:43.139 --> 08:44.163
A regular dance rhythm.

08:44.240 --> 08:47.141
- So, you came right back here?
- That's just what I did.

08:47.210 --> 08:48.837
I got the whole thing all mapped out.

08:48.911 --> 08:52.472
Seven boys and seven girls, tomcats
and pussycats, cast down in one.

08:52.548 --> 08:54.209
Then we go to full stage
with an alley drop...

08:54.283 --> 08:55.648
with the ash cans and a board fence.

08:55.718 --> 08:58.482
Twelve girls come out in kitten costumes.
They're the children, see?

08:58.554 --> 08:59.543
Now forget the cats, will you?

08:59.622 --> 09:02.557
If you don't let up, you're going to
meow yourself into a padded cell.

09:02.625 --> 09:04.684
Now, go on, get washed
and I'll get you a clean shirt.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.524
You're right, Nan. You're perfectly right.
Perfectly right.

09:07.597 --> 09:09.531
But it's still a good idea.

09:09.599 --> 09:11.328
- Here you are.
- Oh, thanks.

09:13.636 --> 09:16.503
Oh, get Mr. Kent
some tomato juice, toast and coffee.

09:16.572 --> 09:18.665
And a bottle of milk for the cat.

09:19.809 --> 09:22.710
Hello? Yes, all right, wait a minute.
Hold on.

09:24.747 --> 09:26.738
The Gay Nineties unit
calling from Kansas City.

09:26.816 --> 09:28.443
The park number runs too long.

09:28.517 --> 09:30.542
All right, I'll talk to him.

09:35.024 --> 09:38.482
Hello? Hello, cut out your first chorus
and open up with your second.

09:38.561 --> 09:40.893
That'll fix it, won't it? All right, fine.

09:42.231 --> 09:44.722
Two units came in yesterday,
finished their tour.

09:44.800 --> 09:47.360
Say, you're slowing up.
Haven't sent out a unit this week.

09:47.436 --> 09:48.926
We're getting two next week.

09:49.005 --> 09:51.405
That is if I can stay out
of the laughing academy that long.

09:51.474 --> 09:54.204
I put a peach into rehearsal yesterday.
Prosperity idea.

09:54.277 --> 09:56.404
- Ring Harry for me, will you?
- Skulking Thompson?

09:56.479 --> 09:59.209
- What have you got against him?
- Just don't like him, that's all.

09:59.282 --> 10:01.341
Sometimes I get the feeling
you don't like anybody.

10:01.417 --> 10:03.044
If you only knew.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.252
Come in.

10:05.755 --> 10:07.017
- Hello, Bea.
- Hello, Nan.

10:07.089 --> 10:08.249
Good morning, Mr. Kent.

10:08.324 --> 10:09.951
- Where's Thompson?
- Out for a few minutes.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.324
He'll be out for life
if he doesn't stick closer to business.

10:12.395 --> 10:13.885
Gould signed 30 more theaters.

10:13.963 --> 10:16.454
That means I've got to think
of three new prologues a week.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.466
Dust off the straightjacket, baby,
we'll need it.

10:18.534 --> 10:19.558
You'll need it.

10:19.635 --> 10:23.196
Mr. Kent, about the bridesmaid unit,
we're short six mirrors.

10:23.272 --> 10:24.603
Well, take the...

10:26.242 --> 10:27.231
Yeah?

10:28.411 --> 10:29.400
What?

10:30.346 --> 10:31.438
Wait a minute.

10:31.514 --> 10:32.776
- More trouble.
- What is it?

10:32.848 --> 10:35.510
Theater in Savannah burned down,
costumes and scenery ruined.

10:35.584 --> 10:36.710
Never a dull moment.

10:36.786 --> 10:38.447
- The soldier girl unit?
- Yeah.

10:38.521 --> 10:41.490
This is their last week.
Why not bring them in?

10:41.557 --> 10:42.785
That's right.

10:43.659 --> 10:45.354
Hello, this is your last week, isn't it?

10:45.428 --> 10:47.362
Bring them in,
we'll put them in something else.

10:47.430 --> 10:48.522
What?

10:48.597 --> 10:51.691
A nice, big coffin,
and I'll lie down alongside.

10:55.338 --> 10:56.896
There's a girl for you.

10:56.972 --> 10:58.837
- What kind of a girl?
- With brains!

10:58.908 --> 11:00.773
You can buy beautiful women
a dime a dozen.

11:00.843 --> 11:02.674
- She's got up here.
- So have I.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.406
- What?
- A headache.

11:06.382 --> 11:07.679
Always the rap.

11:09.685 --> 11:11.050
Here's Old Man River.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.747
- Hey, Chester!
- Not Harry Thompson?

11:12.822 --> 11:15.347
Yeah, with a peach of an idea for a unit.
Now get this...

11:15.424 --> 11:17.551
all the girls come in
dressed as different flowers.

11:17.626 --> 11:20.720
Then for a finish, the leading lady
is the American Beauty rose.

11:20.796 --> 11:22.525
Stop, you're killing me.

11:22.598 --> 11:26.034
I almost fell out of my cradle
when the Shuberts did it back in 1912.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.935
- What a memory.
- Old Faithful, I calls it.

11:29.004 --> 11:30.699
Hoofers like elephants never forget, baby.

11:30.773 --> 11:33.936
Here, Harry, here's a cat idea.
Get it started right away.

11:35.411 --> 11:37.436
Yeah? Yeah, this is Kent.

11:39.882 --> 11:41.543
All right, I'll fix it.

11:41.884 --> 11:45.376
The Iceland unit's in trouble,
cupidal man married the leading lady.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.786
And they're both in the hospital.
That's quick work.

11:47.857 --> 11:49.882
Listen, Nan, send a new boy and girl in
right away.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.824
Make sure they're not
in love with each other.

11:51.894 --> 11:54.089
Get a couple already married.

11:54.263 --> 11:56.663
- Say, Gould wants to see you.
- Nothing strange about that.

11:56.732 --> 11:59.394
- This cat thing ain't bad.
- Well, keep it that way.

11:59.468 --> 12:03.131
Nan, there's some notes down there on a
jigsaw puzzle unit and a willow tree idea.

12:03.205 --> 12:05.230
- Type them up, will you?
- I will.

12:08.411 --> 12:10.174
American Beauty rose.

12:11.781 --> 12:13.510
He said only the cat idea.

12:13.783 --> 12:14.875
Yeah?

12:17.586 --> 12:19.577
Why should we give him a job?
What can he do?

12:19.655 --> 12:22.453
Why, Scott's a lovely singer and dancer.
Isn't he, Si?

12:22.525 --> 12:24.117
Why, he won his spurs in college shows.

12:24.193 --> 12:26.753
Oh, dear, dear Mr. Kent, for my sake,
now I implore you...

12:26.829 --> 12:30.765
Now, Harriet, don't get excited.
You know what the doctor said.

12:30.933 --> 12:32.560
Say, there's an idea, Si. A doctor unit.

12:32.635 --> 12:34.398
The girls, doctors, and the boys, patients.

12:34.470 --> 12:38.873
The girls give the boys a shot in the arm
and they go into a big dance, like this.

12:44.313 --> 12:46.838
- Divine, simply divine.
- Like the idea?

12:46.916 --> 12:49.908
Oh, it's a beautiful idea.
Oh, now you see, dear Mr. Kent...

12:49.985 --> 12:54.422
Scott is my protégé and Scott is such
a dear boy, with the sweetest tenor voice.

12:54.757 --> 12:56.782
Oh, please, please, Mr. Kent!

12:57.927 --> 12:59.588
- Pardon me.
- Sorry.

13:00.463 --> 13:01.760
Mr. Gould is very busy.

13:01.831 --> 13:04.356
I'll say he's busy.
They're talking about me.

13:05.468 --> 13:07.060
That shouldn't take very long.

13:07.136 --> 13:09.696
I'm gonna work here.
Mrs. Gould is giving Kent the good news.

13:09.772 --> 13:13.367
Really? Well, as far as I know,
we have all the office boys we need.

13:13.442 --> 13:15.808
I'm a singer, starred in two shows
at Arkansas College.

13:15.878 --> 13:17.140
Rah, rah.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.443
Our shows play in theaters, not colleges.

13:23.352 --> 13:27.254
Why, he's waiting outside.
Ready and eager to start his career.

13:31.260 --> 13:32.727
Your mistake.

13:33.162 --> 13:37.121
Mr. Kent will be delighted to engage you.
Mr. Kent, I want you to meet Mr. Blair.

13:37.199 --> 13:39.394
- How do you do, sir?
- Oh, it's your great opportunity!

13:39.468 --> 13:40.560
Thanks, Harriet.

13:40.636 --> 13:44.663
Well, I must say adieu now.
I've gotta go see Si about a check.

13:45.741 --> 13:47.641
Come with me
and I'll put you in the cat unit.

13:47.710 --> 13:50.338
- That's keen.
- Don't be so optimistic.

13:50.679 --> 13:52.874
- Meow.
- Meow.

13:55.684 --> 13:57.743
- Hello, Fannie.
- My name's Myrtle, Mr. Kent.

13:57.820 --> 13:58.878
Myrtle?

13:59.555 --> 14:00.817
Come on, girls.

14:04.293 --> 14:05.817
All right, that's good.

14:06.795 --> 14:11.255
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight. Once again.

14:12.067 --> 14:15.264
One, two, three, four, five, six.

14:18.807 --> 14:19.796
Hold it!

14:22.912 --> 14:26.040
- Got a new boy for you, Mac.
- I don't need him.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.106
Neither did I but I caught him.

14:28.584 --> 14:29.949
He's yours, now.

14:30.986 --> 14:32.248
Sit down.

14:34.523 --> 14:36.320
<i>In sprngtme, n fall tme</i>

14:36.392 --> 14:38.053
<i>I face the sun at all tmes</i>

14:38.127 --> 14:41.096
<i>I'm one step ahead of my shadow</i>

14:41.196 --> 14:43.130
<i>It's fathful and noble</i>

14:43.198 --> 14:44.790
<i>The deuce of all my troubles</i>

14:44.867 --> 14:46.528
<i>I'm havng a jolly tme</i>

14:46.602 --> 14:48.331
<i>Travelng the world and I'm</i>

14:48.404 --> 14:52.704
<i>One step ahead of my shadow</i>

14:53.242 --> 14:54.709
Hold it, hold it!

14:55.844 --> 14:57.436
What's the matter now?

14:59.315 --> 15:01.283
This number's as dead
as Chelsea's tonsils.

15:01.350 --> 15:03.818
I worry about this and I worry about that...

15:03.886 --> 15:05.854
Yeah, I know.
You got the kids looking worried, too.

15:05.921 --> 15:07.980
This is a prosperity unit.
Some life and some pep.

15:08.057 --> 15:09.649
Dance on your feet, don't die on them.

15:09.725 --> 15:12.558
Here's the way to attack that finish.
Come on, let's go.

15:14.396 --> 15:15.522
- You got it?
- Yeah.

15:15.598 --> 15:16.895
- Sure.
- All right. Then do it.

15:16.966 --> 15:20.697
I get it, but I got too much
on my shoulders.

15:21.236 --> 15:24.865
It's all her fault.
She gives me absolutely nothing.

15:24.940 --> 15:29.343
How can we look prosperity when he's
got depression all over that pan of his?

15:29.578 --> 15:32.445
There, you see, Mr. Kent?
See what I'm up against?

15:32.514 --> 15:35.608
I'm afraid if this keeps up
I'll have to resign.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.416
You and me both. But until we do,
keep on working, will you?

15:39.488 --> 15:41.422
Come on, let's do it.
All right now, come on.

15:41.490 --> 15:44.152
Give us a pickup there. Come on. Right!

15:44.226 --> 15:45.887
<i>It's fathful and noble</i>

15:45.961 --> 15:47.394
<i>The deuce of all my troubles</i>

15:47.463 --> 15:49.055
<i>I'm havng a jolly tme</i>

15:49.131 --> 15:51.099
<i>Travelng the world and I'm</i>

15:51.166 --> 15:55.068
<i>One step ahead of my shadow</i>

15:55.738 --> 15:56.796
Now what?

15:56.905 --> 16:00.568
We'll have to call off the prosperity unit.
Gladstone just put one on.

16:00.643 --> 16:03.908
I slave day and night worrying about ideas
and Gladstone steals them.

16:03.979 --> 16:05.344
He's been doing it for months.

16:05.414 --> 16:09.612
- All right, girls, let's try it again.
- No, call it off. Prosperity unit's out.

16:09.685 --> 16:12.085
That's all, girls. You're excused. What's in?

16:12.154 --> 16:15.089
The cat number. We'll put it in rehearsal
right away and you're it.

16:15.157 --> 16:17.455
I don't know anything about cats.
I never had a cat.

16:17.526 --> 16:19.289
I've got one for you. It's up in my office.

16:19.361 --> 16:20.692
Yeah, but what'll I do with it?

16:20.763 --> 16:23.129
Go up and get him. Make a pal of him.
Study his movements.

16:23.198 --> 16:26.531
Oh, no, listen, I'm an animal trainer,
not a dance director.

16:26.602 --> 16:31.437
Oh, no, I'm a dance trainer,
not an animal...

16:33.275 --> 16:36.438
You got me so worried
I don't know what I am.

16:37.613 --> 16:41.310
I got bad news for you, Chester.
You can't use the cat idea.

16:41.383 --> 16:44.147
You're gonna start to tell me
what I can and what I can't use.

16:44.219 --> 16:47.279
It's my job to see that our prologues
fit in with the censor's regulations.

16:47.356 --> 16:48.550
I'm only doing my duty.

16:48.624 --> 16:51.320
Oh, I see, the tomcats
and the pussycats are all right.

16:51.393 --> 16:53.725
- But the kittens are illegitimate.
- They certainly are.

16:53.796 --> 16:56.731
Unless they're married by a preacher cat.
No preacher cat, no kittens.

16:56.799 --> 16:59.427
No, you can't use it in 39 cities.

17:00.135 --> 17:02.695
Well, I've got some bad news for you.
You're fired.

17:02.771 --> 17:05.171
You can't fire me. Mrs. Gould's my sister.

17:05.240 --> 17:08.175
I don't care if she's your Aunt Minnie.
Get out of here and stay out.

17:08.242 --> 17:10.871
- Yeah, we'll see about that.
- Get out of here!

17:15.917 --> 17:17.385
Get that cat out of here.

17:17.453 --> 17:19.785
You don't suppose I want him in here,
do you?

17:19.855 --> 17:23.086
Now I got cats to worry about.
I better quit, huh?

17:23.157 --> 17:24.715
We'll go into that later, sweetheart.

17:24.792 --> 17:29.059
Mr. Kent, I have here got all the cat music
from our library.

17:29.131 --> 17:30.689
- Anything good?
- Yeah, sure.

17:30.766 --> 17:34.031
<i>"Cat and the Fddle, Ktten on the Keys,</i>
<i>You are the Cats...</i>

17:34.103 --> 17:38.267
<i>"Cats on Parade, Cat's Meow, Crazy Cat...</i>

17:38.407 --> 17:40.967
<i>"Pussycat, Pussycat,</i>
<i>Where Have You Been?</i>

17:41.043 --> 17:45.070
<i>"Me and My Cat Both Love You,</i>
and <i>Love Me and Love My Cat. "</i>

17:45.314 --> 17:48.010
- Thompson just came in.
- Well, stall him till I get there.

17:48.083 --> 17:49.983
Get <i>Ktten on the Keys</i>
right over to Francis...

17:50.052 --> 17:52.145
and make an orchestration
of <i>Cats on Parade</i> in B flat.

17:52.221 --> 17:53.779
<i>- Cats on Parade</i> in B flat.
- Children!

17:53.856 --> 17:57.383
Children, gather around.
I want you to watch this cat.

18:03.899 --> 18:07.562
So I'm giving you some advice.
Go out and find yourself a nice, new job.

18:07.636 --> 18:08.830
I got one.

18:08.904 --> 18:10.132
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

18:10.205 --> 18:13.470
From now on my business address is
General Director, Gladstone Prologues.

18:13.542 --> 18:15.169
Well, that's fine. After they fire you...

18:15.244 --> 18:17.235
you can put on your dance
at the Old Soldier's Home.

18:17.312 --> 18:18.904
The gate's open.

18:21.350 --> 18:22.442
Gladstone.

18:23.786 --> 18:26.254
- I bet that's our leak.
- I bet you're right.

18:26.321 --> 18:28.152
Why, that dirty lowdown...

18:29.925 --> 18:31.153
Oh, well.

18:31.226 --> 18:33.990
He'll wind up checking soldiers
when he has to think of his own ideas.

18:34.062 --> 18:36.895
He's full of them.
Like American Beauty rose.

18:37.132 --> 18:38.963
Say, you know what I'm gonna do?

18:39.034 --> 18:42.094
I'm gonna keep a half a dozen
of the chorus people here as models.

18:42.171 --> 18:45.299
Teach the new kids the steps. Like it?

18:48.310 --> 18:51.768
Yes, I do. Say, I'll tell you somebody
who'd be swell for a job like that.

18:51.847 --> 18:52.814
- Who?
- Bea Thorn.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.213
- No, too valuable where she is.
- But she's a swell dancer.

18:55.284 --> 18:58.412
- Used to do a turn in vaudeville.
- No, I don't think she'd be interested.

19:00.422 --> 19:02.185
Whatever you say, boss.

19:02.858 --> 19:05.622
- Listen, kid, I'm checking out.
- Lf you go, dear, so do I.

19:05.694 --> 19:07.787
No, I want you to stick.
I've got a special reason.

19:07.863 --> 19:08.887
But I'll never see you.

19:08.964 --> 19:10.431
Yes, you will. We'll have dinner tonight.

19:10.499 --> 19:13.093
Meet me at my place at 7:00.
I'll tell you how you can help me.

19:13.168 --> 19:17.161
Dear Mr. Kent, I promised my father
I'd always look after Charlie.

19:17.239 --> 19:19.070
Think it over, will you, Chester?

19:19.141 --> 19:21.632
All right, all right. Take him back.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.938
Only keep away from me
or I'll sock you right in your blue nose.

19:32.154 --> 19:35.317
And don't you dare let him fire
any more of my relatives.

19:35.457 --> 19:37.220
Come along, Charlie.

19:45.701 --> 19:49.137
One, two, three, four.

19:59.381 --> 20:03.044
Hold it, hold it, hold it.
These are cats, not elephants.

20:03.118 --> 20:05.916
This is about what I want.
Look, watch carefully.

20:11.894 --> 20:13.521
Oh, I get it.

20:17.599 --> 20:19.794
No, I want that certain rhythm.

20:19.868 --> 20:23.634
That certain rhythm,
it's preying on my mind.

20:23.739 --> 20:26.139
What you've got to do is watch that cat.

20:27.142 --> 20:31.238
I hate cats. I can't get away from him.
I've done everything but sleep with him.

20:31.313 --> 20:34.544
Well, sleep with him. You've gotta get it.
Now go to work.

20:34.750 --> 20:37.617
All right, girls, now please,
pay attention, will you?

20:37.686 --> 20:40.951
- I want you to get this. Now watch me.
- Hold it, Mac, hold it.

20:41.023 --> 20:42.422
- Now, watch!
- Hold it!

20:42.891 --> 20:45.724
The Egyptian unit just came in, 29 people.

20:46.194 --> 20:48.059
Call them for rehearsal
tomorrow morning.

20:48.130 --> 20:49.859
We'll put them in the mechanical doll unit.

20:49.932 --> 20:53.834
You must put brassieres on those dolls.
You know Connecticut.

20:53.902 --> 20:55.563
What do they have to do
in Massachusetts?

20:55.637 --> 20:57.366
Wear red flannel drawers?

20:58.307 --> 21:00.832
Rehearsal's off.
Call them back at 8:00 tonight.

21:00.909 --> 21:03.537
Rehearsal's over, kids.
Back at 8:00 tonight.

21:08.250 --> 21:12.118
- Hello. Say, did you see me dancing?
- Do you crochet, too?

21:12.187 --> 21:15.452
No, not me, but I got a tenor voice
people come miles to hear.

21:15.524 --> 21:16.786
Here's a sample of it:

21:16.858 --> 21:20.692
<i>Sweet Adelne</i>

21:21.096 --> 21:23.360
Hey, wait a minute. What's the matter?
Don't you like it?

21:23.432 --> 21:26.060
You must've gone over big
at Arkansas College.

21:26.134 --> 21:28.159
Well, I guess you don't appreciate me.

21:28.236 --> 21:32.104
Oh, no? Well, here comes someone
who does. Mrs. Gould, he's waiting.

21:32.174 --> 21:34.768
Oh, Scott, dear. I'm just in time.

21:35.510 --> 21:37.171
Yep, just in time.

21:40.082 --> 21:42.175
A wet nurse to an alley cat.

21:55.130 --> 21:56.597
Closing time.

21:56.999 --> 22:00.628
Yeah, another day, another gray hair.
Wonder what it's getting me.

22:00.702 --> 22:04.160
- You're a one-third partner, aren't you?
- Yep. My third does all the work.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.332
While the other two-thirds
drag down the money.

22:06.408 --> 22:08.239
Yeah. Maybe it's better
to be one of the help.

22:08.310 --> 22:10.437
I'm supposed to be getting
a percentage of the profits.

22:10.512 --> 22:12.571
But so far everything's gone
back into production.

22:12.647 --> 22:15.582
So they say.
Why don't you do some investigating?

22:15.650 --> 22:19.245
I'm too busy.
I'm daffy trying to think up new ideas.

22:22.124 --> 22:23.716
We've done everything.

22:28.196 --> 22:30.528
"Soldier Girl Unit, Bull Fighters,
Blue Girls...

22:30.599 --> 22:33.363
"Ghost, Baby Dolls, Voo-Doo,
Russian Revolution."

22:33.435 --> 22:36.302
There's nothing left in the world.
A unit a week.

22:36.371 --> 22:38.601
Where am I going to get any more ideas?

22:38.673 --> 22:41.141
When I do get them,
Gladstone steals them.

22:41.576 --> 22:42.804
I'm falling apart.

22:42.878 --> 22:45.210
Why don't you get something to eat
and go right home?

22:45.280 --> 22:48.249
No, I can't. I gotta stay and dovetail
all this cat unit stuff.

22:48.316 --> 22:51.877
If I promise to take him home with me,
will you go right to bed?

22:53.989 --> 22:55.388
It's a bargain.

22:58.860 --> 23:03.456
Say, what's the name of that foreigner
that built the monster he couldn't stop?

23:03.598 --> 23:05.065
Frankenstein.

23:05.834 --> 23:08.132
Shake hands with his Aunt Emma.

23:09.671 --> 23:11.036
Good night.

23:15.977 --> 23:19.344
Frankenstein. Swell idea for a unit.

23:36.465 --> 23:38.831
That looks vaguely familiar.

23:38.967 --> 23:40.867
<i>Bonsor,</i> Nanette.

23:40.936 --> 23:43.905
- Vivian!
- I got the janitor to let me in.

23:43.972 --> 23:46.202
I knew you wouldn't mind
putting me up for a day or two.

23:46.274 --> 23:48.504
- I thought you were in Hollywood.
- I was.

23:48.577 --> 23:51.774
The pictures bored me.
So little culture out there, my dear.

23:51.847 --> 23:54.782
- What is this culture gag all of a sudden?
- I beg your pardon?

23:54.850 --> 23:57.011
Now, relax, will you?
I said, "All of a sudden."

23:57.085 --> 24:00.577
Last time I saw you, your conversation
was practically dese, dems, and doses.

24:00.655 --> 24:02.179
We grow up, you know.

24:02.257 --> 24:05.249
What was it Professor Malanoff said?
"Life is..."

24:05.327 --> 24:07.318
- "Life is..."
- Just a bowl of cherries?

24:07.395 --> 24:10.660
- No, but that's a very interesting thought.
- Nerts.

24:13.502 --> 24:15.766
Yeah, sure I love you.
But now listen, give me the dope.

24:15.837 --> 24:17.236
What's happening at Frazer and Gould's?

24:17.305 --> 24:18.363
They're rehearsing a new act.

24:18.440 --> 24:21.102
The girls dress like mechanical dolls
and the boys wind them up.

24:21.176 --> 24:22.700
Mr. Kent got the idea today.

24:22.777 --> 24:25.610
Swell. Move it, babe,
while I give it to Gladstone.

24:29.317 --> 24:31.217
Remember now, you can only stay
till Aunt Clara...

24:31.286 --> 24:33.584
or somebody or something
comes through.

24:35.390 --> 24:38.223
- Who is it?
- Kent. I wanna talk with you.

24:38.293 --> 24:41.023
Just a minute. You answer the door.

24:48.203 --> 24:49.932
Come in, won't you?

24:59.848 --> 25:03.284
Be right out. The girl is Miss Rich.
Vivian, Mr. Kent.

25:03.652 --> 25:05.313
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

25:05.387 --> 25:08.288
In California, I never missed
a Chester Kent Prologue.

25:08.356 --> 25:12.554
They were all so... What shall I say?
Intellectually devised.

25:12.694 --> 25:16.357
I'm glad you liked them, Miss Rich.
I wouldn't call them exactly intellectual.

25:16.431 --> 25:17.830
You're just modest.

25:17.899 --> 25:21.926
Every one had a definite central theme.
Brains, you know.

25:24.606 --> 25:26.904
- Maybe you're right at that.
- Anything special?

25:26.975 --> 25:30.103
I got some new ideas on that cat stuff,
wanted the outline.

25:30.178 --> 25:31.805
It's on the desk.

25:32.180 --> 25:35.047
Most prologues, Mr. Kent,
are utterly commonplace.

25:35.116 --> 25:37.778
But yours, yours have meaning.

25:37.852 --> 25:41.720
What was it Ruskin said?
"That intangible something."

25:41.823 --> 25:45.054
Oh, Vivian? What ever happened
to that boyfriend of yours?

25:45.126 --> 25:46.855
Is he still a bootlegger?

25:47.696 --> 25:51.962
- Nan is so bourgeois at times.
- Swell gal, though, works like a slave.

25:52.100 --> 25:56.127
Speaking of that, I was reading a most
interesting book, <i>Slavery In Old Afrca.</i>

25:56.204 --> 25:59.037
- Have you read it?
- I don't even have time to read my mail.

25:59.107 --> 26:01.302
Oh, it's filled with the most
fascinating pictures.

26:01.376 --> 26:04.868
- All the women were slaves...
- Hold it, Vivian, I is a coming!

26:06.181 --> 26:07.773
Say, that's a natural.

26:09.317 --> 26:12.548
- Where is this book?
- I think I know a shop that keeps it.

26:12.621 --> 26:15.021
I can see it now. Pretty girls in black face.

26:15.090 --> 26:18.116
"Slaves of Old Africa."
White men capture them.

26:18.193 --> 26:21.822
- Can we get that book tonight?
- Perhaps, if we leave right away.

26:21.896 --> 26:25.332
- Well, let's get going.
- Oh dear, I forgot. I've had no dinner.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.493
Well, have it with me.
After we find a bookshop.

26:27.569 --> 26:29.002
I'd adore it.

26:31.106 --> 26:32.664
Good night, Nanette.

26:32.841 --> 26:37.244
Oh, good night. Never mind the outline.
I think I've got a new one.

26:52.260 --> 26:55.093
One, two, three, four, five, six, down.

26:55.163 --> 26:56.187
Mr. Francis?

26:56.631 --> 26:58.826
The music department sent down
this new arrangement.

26:58.900 --> 27:01.391
Give it to Joe. Can't you see I'm busy?

27:01.770 --> 27:06.673
I've got everything on my shoulders.
Music, costume, girls, cats.

27:07.208 --> 27:09.233
And now I'm beginning to sniffle.

27:09.311 --> 27:12.212
I feel as though I'm coming down
with a dreadful...

27:13.581 --> 27:15.412
Now that's where Scotty comes in.

27:15.483 --> 27:17.451
- Where is he?
- He isn't in yet.

27:17.519 --> 27:21.615
Mr. Kent's gonna hear about this.
From the beginning, girls.

27:21.690 --> 27:24.250
One, two, three, four, five, six, down.

27:25.460 --> 27:26.688
You know you're late, don't you?

27:26.761 --> 27:29.252
<i>Good mornng, dear teacher</i>
<i>Good mornng to you</i>

27:29.331 --> 27:30.628
I'm going to report you.

27:30.699 --> 27:33.600
Mr. Kent is very strict
about chorus people being on time.

27:33.668 --> 27:35.659
- I'm not in the chorus anymore.
- Oh.

27:35.737 --> 27:37.796
- They threw me out.
- I'm sorry.

27:37.872 --> 27:39.237
And you were gonna report me.

27:39.307 --> 27:43.175
One, two, three, four, five, six, down.
One, two, three...

27:43.244 --> 27:45.235
Perhaps I could speak to Mr. Kent.
He might...

27:45.313 --> 27:49.613
Now that's not fair, Miss Thorn.
You know I'm all upset. Look.

27:49.684 --> 27:51.914
My hair's turning gray
with so much on my mind...

27:51.986 --> 27:53.920
and you're keeping Scotty from rehearsals.

27:53.988 --> 27:55.512
But he isn't in your chorus anymore.

27:55.590 --> 27:58.491
Well, of course, he isn't.
They made him a principal last night.

27:58.560 --> 28:00.152
A principal! Him?

28:00.228 --> 28:01.991
I told you your favorite people had a voice.

28:02.063 --> 28:05.191
All these annoyances piling up.
Come on, Scotty.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.666
I'm waiting for you to sing that number.

28:08.536 --> 28:10.697
Don't get a cold, will you? Come on.

28:11.740 --> 28:14.436
- So long, time clock.
- So long, crooner.

28:15.410 --> 28:17.970
Here's the statement
for the last six months.

28:18.780 --> 28:20.714
Profits going up all the time.

28:20.949 --> 28:23.247
And here's the statement for Mr. Kent.

28:23.685 --> 28:25.016
No profits at all.

28:25.086 --> 28:28.214
Well, Mr. Kent's statement shows that
all profits go back into production.

28:28.289 --> 28:29.586
- Is that right?
- Exactly.

28:29.657 --> 28:34.026
- Draw $20,000 in cash for Gould and me.
- Charge it to production costs as usual.

28:34.095 --> 28:36.586
Yes, and take a century note for yourself.

28:42.370 --> 28:44.531
- Good morning.
- Is it still morning?

29:05.193 --> 29:06.854
You beautiful girl.

29:09.864 --> 29:11.661
Nice of you to drop in.

29:14.502 --> 29:16.868
There's some mighty pretty country
around here.

29:16.938 --> 29:20.339
Eleven wires, nine phone calls and one
secretary slowly going out of her mind.

29:20.408 --> 29:21.841
Arrange an audition for some girls.

29:21.910 --> 29:23.741
I want one
to sing that number with Scotty.

29:23.812 --> 29:26.406
And I'm starting a new department today:
Styles and Ideas.

29:26.481 --> 29:28.574
- Who's gonna run it?
- She'll be here in a minute.

29:28.650 --> 29:30.845
Has brains and all kinds of culture.
Just what we need.

29:30.919 --> 29:34.480
Gave me a swell idea: Slaves of Old Africa.
A hit.

29:34.622 --> 29:36.749
I should've kicked her out
the minute I saw her.

29:36.825 --> 29:37.792
Hello?

29:37.859 --> 29:40.851
Four girls from the Swiss Navy unit
married a quartet in Philadelphia...

29:40.929 --> 29:42.794
- yesterday and they wanna quit.
- Quartet any good?

29:42.864 --> 29:44.422
Is the quartet any good? Yeah.

29:44.499 --> 29:46.990
- Put them in the act.
- Put them in the act.

29:47.902 --> 29:51.099
- Sorry, Chester, to keep you waiting.
- Hello, Vivian.

29:52.307 --> 29:54.537
This is Miss Rich.
My secretary, Miss Prescott.

29:54.609 --> 29:57.009
I know Miss Rich, if you remember.

29:57.078 --> 29:59.706
Oh, yeah, that's right.
I met her at your place.

29:59.781 --> 30:02.045
Vivian is the head of our
new Style and Idea department.

30:02.116 --> 30:04.209
I hope you'll both be very happy.

30:04.986 --> 30:08.979
Oh, Nan, would you get
Miss Rich an office?

30:09.057 --> 30:12.686
I'm awfully busy, but I'll see that it's done.
This way, please.

30:12.961 --> 30:15.657
Don't forget about
our luncheon engagement, Chester.

30:15.730 --> 30:17.129
- 1:00.
- Right.

30:26.774 --> 30:29.436
- She work here?
- Our new Style and Idea department...

30:29.511 --> 30:30.671
the head.

30:31.079 --> 30:33.479
Splendid choice, Chester, splendid choice.

30:33.548 --> 30:35.277
- Get her an office.
- Okay.

30:36.751 --> 30:39.151
Here's our semi-annual statement.

30:48.463 --> 30:50.931
- Maybe I'd be better off on a salary.
- I'll say you would.

30:50.999 --> 30:53.331
When you've got a third interest?
Don't kid yourself.

30:53.401 --> 30:55.835
Frazer and I ain't drawing a cent
out of the business either.

30:55.904 --> 30:57.997
It's tough on you boys.
I don't see how you get along.

30:58.072 --> 31:01.235
And besides, Gladstone's copped
the mechanical doll angle already.

31:01.309 --> 31:03.971
- I'll stop it some way, Chester.
- That's gonna be a big help.

31:04.045 --> 31:05.603
Between Gladstone stealing all our stuff...

31:05.680 --> 31:07.011
and you saying there are no profits...

31:07.081 --> 31:08.309
I'm getting pretty well fed up.

31:08.383 --> 31:11.284
But, Chester, think of
the Apollo Deluxe Theater.

31:11.352 --> 31:13.047
- So what?
- They're gonna do prologues.

31:13.121 --> 31:14.918
- Forty houses.
- Have you signed them?

31:14.989 --> 31:17.514
Apolinaris says they're too classy
for our regular stuff.

31:17.592 --> 31:19.924
And Gladstone's hot after the contract.

31:19.994 --> 31:22.656
It's up to you, Chester,
to think up something original.

31:22.730 --> 31:25.324
Gladstone again. That means Thompson.

31:28.636 --> 31:30.035
Well, we'll take care of him.

31:30.104 --> 31:33.904
That's the spirit, Chester.
I knew we could count on you.

31:41.683 --> 31:42.911
Come in.

31:44.786 --> 31:46.515
I'm Charlie Bowers.

31:48.690 --> 31:50.851
- Well?
- Mrs. Gould's brother.

31:51.426 --> 31:54.691
Of course.
Won't you come in, Mr. Bowers?

31:54.796 --> 31:56.320
Yes, thank you.

31:57.398 --> 32:00.265
- Awfully glad you dropped in.
- Yes, same here.

32:00.335 --> 32:02.235
- So sweet of you to say that.
- Yeah.

32:02.303 --> 32:05.739
Gives one the feeling of...
What shall I say?

32:07.108 --> 32:08.336
<i>Esprt de corps.</i>

32:08.409 --> 32:10.934
Yeah, that's the way I feel about it.

32:11.546 --> 32:13.411
Oh, I'd like to ask you, Mr. Bowers...

32:13.481 --> 32:15.711
- Pardon me.
- That's all right. Go too far.

32:16.884 --> 32:20.479
All right, girls, stand up!
Show Mr. Kent your legs.

32:20.755 --> 32:23.952
- Oh, higher, higher.
- This is an audition, not an exhibition.

32:24.025 --> 32:26.653
I'm not a mind reader, you know.
Down, girls.

32:27.662 --> 32:30.859
This audition is to find a girl
to sing a number with Mr. Blair.

32:30.932 --> 32:32.866
- You all got copies of the song?
- All of them.

32:32.934 --> 32:36.563
Sing it for them once, will you, Scotty?
And, Francis, show the routine.

32:37.038 --> 32:39.700
- Just pick up there.
- Watch this very carefully, girls.

32:39.774 --> 32:42.436
<i>Ah, the moon s here</i>

32:42.510 --> 32:45.479
<i>Ah, and we are here</i>

32:45.546 --> 32:50.074
<i>Love s offi to a wonderful start</i>

32:51.552 --> 32:53.611
<i>I'm sttng pretty</i>

32:53.688 --> 32:56.452
<i>And you're by my sde</i>

32:56.824 --> 32:59.850
<i>I'm well-suppled</i>

32:59.927 --> 33:02.919
<i>Plenty of you, plenty to do</i>

33:02.997 --> 33:05.864
<i>Ah, t feels so grand</i>

33:05.933 --> 33:08.868
<i>When I hold your hand</i>

33:08.936 --> 33:13.703
<i>There's a hop, skp and jump n my heart</i>

33:15.176 --> 33:19.704
<i>What s ths funny thng</i>
<i>I can't get too much of?</i>

33:22.150 --> 33:26.985
<i>I've got a feelng t's love</i>

33:28.122 --> 33:31.023
All right. You got the idea, girls? Let's go.

33:31.125 --> 33:32.786
- Now, who's first?
- Mary.

33:33.995 --> 33:36.020
Give us a pickup. Great.

33:37.331 --> 33:39.925
<i>Ah, the moon s here</i>

33:40.034 --> 33:43.128
<i>Ah, and we are here</i>

33:44.972 --> 33:48.908
Sorry. Sorry, little lady. Next.
You're next. Come on.

33:50.178 --> 33:51.509
Pick up there.

33:54.582 --> 33:59.246
I always get in my singing mood
with perfume. Do you mind?

33:59.721 --> 34:01.848
Never mind the smell, honey. Sing.

34:03.624 --> 34:07.151
<i>Ah, the moon s here</i>

34:07.295 --> 34:10.753
<i>Ah, and we are here</i>

34:10.831 --> 34:14.824
<i>Love s offi to a wonderful start</i>

34:14.936 --> 34:16.460
Sorry. Sorry, won't do.

34:16.536 --> 34:19.130
Why, I've sung before crowned heads.

34:19.540 --> 34:23.636
You've laid yourself wide open for a crack.
We'll let it go. All right, next.

34:23.710 --> 34:25.679
Come on, you're next. Give us a pickup.

34:27.681 --> 34:30.708
<i>Ah, the moon s here</i>

34:30.784 --> 34:33.514
<i>Ah, and we are here</i>

34:33.920 --> 34:38.824
<i>Love s offi to a beautful start</i>

34:39.927 --> 34:42.395

34:51.505 --> 34:54.907
<i>Ah, t feels so grand</i>

34:55.009 --> 34:58.206
<i>When you hold my hand</i>

34:58.279 --> 35:02.875

35:03.951 --> 35:08.820
<i>What s ths funny thng</i>
<i>I can't get too much of?</i>

35:11.092 --> 35:15.961
<i>I've got a feelng t's love</i>

35:17.231 --> 35:19.324
All right, that's it. Get to work, Francis.

35:19.400 --> 35:20.492
- Nice going, kid.
- Thanks.

35:20.568 --> 35:23.765
That's all for the singers.
Dancing girls on the stage.

35:23.838 --> 35:25.635
Hit that again for me, will you?

35:25.706 --> 35:27.469
On the stage, girls, hurry!

35:32.513 --> 35:34.640
Come, dear.
I've come to take you to lunch.

35:34.715 --> 35:37.479
Gee, that's nice of you, Harriet.
I'd love to go, but...

35:37.552 --> 35:39.747
I'm not eating lunch anymore.
I'm in training now.

35:39.821 --> 35:42.551
Well, you can walk with me as far
as Si's office, can't you?

35:42.623 --> 35:45.592
- Si's office? Oh, yeah.
- All right, sweetie pie.

35:51.199 --> 35:53.690
- Have you seen Miss Thorn?
- I think she's gone to lunch.

35:53.768 --> 35:55.497
Oh. Thanks.

35:56.838 --> 36:01.798
<i>What s ths funny thng</i>
<i>I can't get too much of?</i>

36:04.078 --> 36:08.879
<i>I've got a feelng t's love</i>

36:09.450 --> 36:10.474
Lunch!

36:18.559 --> 36:22.120
- Have you seen Mr. Blair?
- He's gone to lunch with Mrs. Gould.

36:23.197 --> 36:24.459
He would.

36:26.734 --> 36:28.497
Well, use a short introduction.

36:30.504 --> 36:33.337
Then bring Miss Schubert
out for her number. Yeah.

36:34.775 --> 36:35.867
These wires just came.

36:35.943 --> 36:38.309
No, no, no, do it that way.
Just that way. Yeah.

36:38.613 --> 36:39.739
These wires just came.

36:39.814 --> 36:41.805
I can't look at them now.
I got a date for lunch.

36:41.883 --> 36:45.114
Phone Miss Rich and tell her
I'll be right over, will you?

37:02.136 --> 37:03.535
Miss Rich, please.

37:04.272 --> 37:06.900
Miss Rich? I'm calling for Mr. Kent.

37:07.174 --> 37:09.039
Yes, he won't be able
to have lunch with you.

37:09.110 --> 37:10.805
No, he said you may take
the afternoon off.

37:10.878 --> 37:14.245
He doesn't want you
to strain yourself the first day.

37:22.156 --> 37:25.057
- Hello, hello.
- It's the only vacant seat.

37:25.126 --> 37:27.287
At least you're sitting next to
another good singer.

37:27.361 --> 37:29.795
I'll try not to let it spoil my lunch.

37:30.097 --> 37:32.861
Why, Scott dear, you told me
you stopped eating lunch.

37:32.934 --> 37:35.767
Well, I have. You see, actually,
I'm just having breakfast.

37:35.836 --> 37:38.669
Well, I'll forgive you this time,
you naughty boy.

37:39.006 --> 37:40.633
I'll take spinach.

37:41.309 --> 37:45.211
If I were a man, I wouldn't be a lapdog
tied to any woman's apron strings.

37:45.279 --> 37:47.839
- I might surprise you.
- You probably won't.

37:54.188 --> 37:55.883
Mr. Kent, I wanna quit.

37:55.957 --> 37:57.424
Don't be silly, singers never quit.

37:57.491 --> 37:59.152
They hang on
till somebody knocks them off.

37:59.226 --> 38:01.956
I know, but that's why I wanna quit.
There's no future in singing.

38:02.029 --> 38:03.860
- What do you wanna do?
- I wanna be your assistant.

38:03.931 --> 38:05.330
You haven't filled Thompson's job yet.

38:05.399 --> 38:07.560
I'll work a year for nothing
if you insist on a sample.

38:07.635 --> 38:09.159
You're reading those magazine ads again.

38:09.236 --> 38:11.033
"How I Became President
of the Atlas Pickle Works."

38:11.105 --> 38:13.300
Give me a chance at the job, will you?
That's all I want.

38:13.374 --> 38:14.807
I know I'll make good. But if I fail...

38:14.875 --> 38:17.673
We'll make-believe you're Mrs. Gould's
relative. Keep you on anyway.

38:17.745 --> 38:19.576
- You've got the job.
- Thanks.

38:21.983 --> 38:25.783
So Mrs. Gould sniveled you
into another job.

38:26.053 --> 38:28.078
I got this absolutely on my own.

38:28.656 --> 38:30.920
Is there any business
you wish to discuss with me?

38:30.992 --> 38:34.484
No, that's the trouble with you.
You're all business. All efficiency.

38:34.562 --> 38:36.655
You're not alive. You're not a bit feminine.

38:36.731 --> 38:38.426
Look at that dress. Look at those glasses.

38:38.499 --> 38:40.262
All you need is a pair
of brown-paper shoes...

38:40.334 --> 38:43.167
and <i>The Atlantc Monthly</i>
tucked under your arm.

38:43.871 --> 38:45.168
Anything else?

38:45.239 --> 38:47.799
That's all. If I need you, I'll send for you.

38:55.282 --> 38:57.011
No, Mr. Kent is busy.

38:57.084 --> 39:00.542
- Nan, are you busy?
- No, just dreaming lazily about life.

39:00.621 --> 39:02.350
Tell me, where do you get your hair done...

39:02.423 --> 39:04.653
and where do you get
all those pretty dresses?

39:04.725 --> 39:06.317
What's the idea?

39:06.560 --> 39:08.323
You're the type men like and...

39:08.396 --> 39:09.556
Me?

39:11.265 --> 39:13.096
Know any more funny stories?

39:21.776 --> 39:23.038
Mr. Kent.

39:29.316 --> 39:30.340
Yeah?

39:31.052 --> 39:34.613
Listen, cut a minute out of George's
comedy...

39:35.256 --> 39:38.589
and then bring the trumpet sextet
up before the Hawaiian number.

39:38.659 --> 39:39.819
See my secretary.

39:39.894 --> 39:41.486
And if you're still overtime...

39:41.796 --> 39:44.321
Wait a minute,
call me back in five minutes.

39:48.936 --> 39:50.233
- No!
- Yes.

39:50.671 --> 39:52.662
The one girl in the place
that showed some sense.

39:52.740 --> 39:56.232
I got sick of looking like a schoolteacher
and I'm sick of working in an office.

39:56.310 --> 39:57.971
I wanna go back on the stage.

39:58.045 --> 40:00.445
It was just a question of time
before this place got to you.

40:00.514 --> 40:02.243
- Did you say she could dance?
- One of the best.

40:02.316 --> 40:03.749
All right. Hold it!

40:03.818 --> 40:05.183
- Hold it!
- Hold it!

40:05.252 --> 40:06.981
Let's see what you can do.

40:07.288 --> 40:09.688
Play something in two-four.
Same thing. Go ahead.

40:25.706 --> 40:27.105
Fine, that's grand.

40:27.174 --> 40:29.438
How'd you like the job
of teaching new kids the routines?

40:29.510 --> 40:31.535
Gee, Mr. Kent, that'd be swell.

40:31.612 --> 40:33.944
All right, job's yours. Oh, Francis...

40:34.682 --> 40:36.616
Miss Thorn is your new assistant.

40:36.917 --> 40:40.045
It can't be done, Mr. Kent, it can't be done.

40:40.721 --> 40:43.212
All right, Miss Thorn, you watch it
from over there, will you?

40:43.290 --> 40:45.155
All right, girls, places.

40:46.927 --> 40:48.758
Another good gal gone wrong.

40:49.430 --> 40:50.954
<i>Come out, come out</i>

40:51.031 --> 40:52.498
<i>Come out and get your lovng</i>

40:52.566 --> 40:55.558

41:09.650 --> 41:11.242

41:11.318 --> 41:13.946
<i>Sttng on a backyard fence</i>

41:14.021 --> 41:17.388
<i>It may be just another lttle backyard alley</i>

43:29.623 --> 43:31.853

43:31.925 --> 43:33.290
That's all!

43:36.297 --> 43:38.765
Those contortions are pretty vulgar.

43:38.832 --> 43:40.959
One thing after another.

43:43.771 --> 43:45.204
Just a minute.

43:45.272 --> 43:48.105
- You look like a girl I used to know.
- Oh, really?

43:48.175 --> 43:50.109
You're new here, aren't you?

43:50.678 --> 43:53.238
I thought so.
You tried to fool me, didn't you?

43:53.647 --> 43:56.946
But what a change. You're beautiful.
And what a dancer.

43:57.685 --> 43:59.710
Is that all you can say?

43:59.787 --> 44:01.755
Well, how about a little kiss then?

44:02.690 --> 44:05.818
Mrs. Gould's little boy? I should say not.

44:08.495 --> 44:10.463
Chester, you gotta do about
something quick.

44:10.531 --> 44:12.999
The Apollo deal's hot
and Gladstone's after the contract.

44:13.067 --> 44:14.432
Forget Gladstone.

44:14.635 --> 44:17.604
I'll give you something tomorrow
that'll knock Apollo for a loop.

44:17.671 --> 44:18.865
Yeah.

44:19.940 --> 44:21.532
Now all I have to do is think it up.

44:21.608 --> 44:23.337
Maybe we'd better go back to your office.

44:23.410 --> 44:24.604
Yeah...

44:24.945 --> 44:27.675
Yeah, that's right.
Can't keep my mind on the race here.

44:27.748 --> 44:29.147
But, Chester?

44:29.316 --> 44:31.284
I'll pick you up at 6:00.

44:34.755 --> 44:36.950
You're gonna get picked up again.

44:41.261 --> 44:43.195
Old Faithful's gone blank on me.

44:43.263 --> 44:46.061
I thought of a thousand ideas
and every one of them moth-eaten.

44:46.133 --> 44:49.466
If the little girl's not too bold,
how's for me sticking with you to get it.

44:49.536 --> 44:51.265
You could think out loud.

44:51.405 --> 44:52.872
- Like we used to?
- It might help.

44:52.940 --> 44:55.773
- Keep throwing ideas at me.
- And you throw the poor ones right back.

44:55.843 --> 44:56.867
Sold.

44:56.944 --> 44:58.878
We'll give Apollo a show
if it takes all night.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.538
We'll have dinner, think and walk.

45:00.614 --> 45:01.842
Let's go.

45:13.394 --> 45:14.884
Got something?

45:15.929 --> 45:18.193
It was so old you had to fumigate it.

45:19.700 --> 45:24.296
Say, how about a great big coffee pot,
boys come out, and the girls come out...

45:26.507 --> 45:28.236
and the audience goes out.

45:28.809 --> 45:31.073
I think the jury better go out again.

45:32.913 --> 45:35.347
We could have a band on the stage
and the chorus in the pit.

45:35.416 --> 45:37.008
How about trees?

45:40.287 --> 45:42.380
We've had flowers, pictures...

45:43.090 --> 45:48.050
tables, radios, statues,
more tables, sofas, pianos.

45:50.831 --> 45:52.025
Oh, nerts.

45:54.134 --> 45:55.897
No good for a unit.

46:04.378 --> 46:05.436
Hello?

46:05.512 --> 46:07.844
Who's speaking? Nan?

46:07.915 --> 46:09.177
Nobody else.

46:09.249 --> 46:11.444
I wouldn't think of waking him.
He's sleeping.

46:11.518 --> 46:14.419
And so was I when you called.
Goodbye, dear.

46:17.324 --> 46:19.451
Move over, Chester, darling.

46:27.468 --> 46:28.628
Hello?

46:29.403 --> 46:32.099
It can't be out of order.
I just spoke to them.

46:32.606 --> 46:35.040
- How'd you sleep?
- Like a newborn child.

46:35.108 --> 46:38.373
So did I. No ideas, though.
Didn't even dream of one.

46:41.582 --> 46:44.176
Maybe we'd better start all over again.

46:45.919 --> 46:48.581
How do you suppose
an insane asylum idea would go?

46:48.655 --> 46:50.748
I could play the lead myself
without any trouble.

46:50.824 --> 46:52.018
Me, too.

46:53.360 --> 46:54.850
Hey, look at this.

46:55.963 --> 46:58.397
"What happens to
unproduced musical comedies?"

46:58.465 --> 47:01.730
- What does happen to them?
- "They gather dust on the shelves."

47:04.438 --> 47:05.837
Say, we've got it.

47:06.206 --> 47:07.833
I know we've got it!

47:07.908 --> 47:09.933
- Apolinaris is in the bag.
- What do you mean?

47:10.010 --> 47:11.910
"What happens to
unproduced musical comedies?"

47:11.979 --> 47:13.640
I can tell you
what's gonna happen to them.

47:13.714 --> 47:15.443
We'll put them in picture houses,
prologues!

47:15.516 --> 47:16.881
- Grand!
- Cut them down to 40 minutes.

47:16.950 --> 47:19.043
Give them a picture
and a musical comedy for 50 cents.

47:19.119 --> 47:20.814
Most picture fans
never saw a musical comedy.

47:20.888 --> 47:23.379
That's the idea. Come on, let's grab a cab!

47:23.490 --> 47:25.481
Instead of 40 people,
our musicals will have 80.

47:25.559 --> 47:28.119
- I'm afraid of it.
- Now, I know it's good. We'll do it.

47:28.195 --> 47:29.594
Sure, we can't miss.

47:29.663 --> 47:31.824
I'll have George Apolinaris
up to dinner tonight.

47:31.899 --> 47:33.389
I'll be there.

47:33.634 --> 47:35.932
He'll be there. Our troubles are over.

47:39.973 --> 47:41.907
There you are, Mr. Apolinaris.

47:41.975 --> 47:46.071
You give them a musical comedy
and a picture, all for 50 cents.

47:46.146 --> 47:48.876
It's good. But somebody beat you to it.

47:49.316 --> 47:50.442
Impossible.

47:50.851 --> 47:52.876
You know Thompson,
Gladstone's director?

47:52.953 --> 47:55.353
- Doing the same thing?
- Sure, same thing.

47:55.422 --> 47:59.085
- But he stole our idea.
- Well, sue him. It ain't my funeral.

47:59.860 --> 48:02.488
Gladstone's got three prologues
in rehearsal.

48:02.563 --> 48:04.463
Gonna show them to me Sunday.

48:04.565 --> 48:07.625
Now here's what I'll do.
You fellows get three started...

48:07.701 --> 48:09.828
but they got to be ready Saturday night.

48:09.903 --> 48:14.135
I'll preview them in three of my houses
around town and get audience reaction.

48:14.241 --> 48:17.733
What I like ain't worth a cent.
What audiences like is worth a million.

48:17.811 --> 48:21.872
- And if the audience likes our stuff?
- You'll get the contract for the whole 40.

48:21.949 --> 48:24.713
If not, I sign with Gladstone.

48:25.385 --> 48:27.512
Give me a good reason why not.

48:29.423 --> 48:30.720
I ate too much.

48:30.791 --> 48:32.816
We'll see Kent and let you know.

48:32.993 --> 48:34.620
That's up to you gents.

48:35.362 --> 48:37.592
Well, so long.

48:42.603 --> 48:44.833
I hope your dinner
shouldn't make me indigestion.

48:44.905 --> 48:47.032
Yeah, well, good night. Good night.

48:48.909 --> 48:50.342
We gotta get hold of Kent.

48:50.410 --> 48:52.275
Try his secretary, she'll know where he is.

48:57.584 --> 48:58.812
Hello?

48:58.952 --> 49:00.544
Oh, yes, Mr. Frazer.

49:01.788 --> 49:03.517
Well, I may see him later.

49:03.857 --> 49:07.122
Yeah, it'll be late all right,
but I'll surely send him over.

49:30.484 --> 49:32.577
How's the world's best secretary?

49:38.558 --> 49:41.618
- I'll take care of him.
- Looks like you have already.

49:43.096 --> 49:44.461
Here, drink this.

49:45.065 --> 49:47.761
They want you
at Frazer's apartment right away.

49:50.037 --> 49:52.130
Can't be annoyed, can't be annoyed.

49:53.206 --> 49:55.766
Got the greatest news of my life tonight.

49:57.678 --> 50:00.078
Don't tell me you married that chiseler?

50:01.348 --> 50:03.680
I'll thank you not to insult
the future Mrs. Kent.

50:03.750 --> 50:05.149
I'm glad you said "future."

50:05.218 --> 50:07.743
I always ignore crude persons, dear.

50:10.424 --> 50:13.291
- I'll take care of you later.
- Well, now, wait...

50:14.461 --> 50:18.192
- You got a taxi waiting?
- Always got a taxi waiting.

50:20.934 --> 50:23.630
Now you listen to me.
This is your big chance.

50:23.704 --> 50:27.140
Forty units in deluxe houses.
The whole Apollo circuit.

50:27.207 --> 50:29.038
It's too late for units.

50:29.209 --> 50:31.404
Units to the right of them.
Units to the left of them.

50:31.478 --> 50:33.673
Volleyed and thundered
and lightening and everything.

50:33.747 --> 50:35.612
Come on, now, you get up here!

50:35.682 --> 50:37.673
This is a chance of a lifetime.

50:40.754 --> 50:44.713
All right, all right, I'll go,
but I want you to know I resent this.

50:47.427 --> 50:49.292
How dare you! My fiancé.

50:49.362 --> 50:51.728
Now you scram before I wrap a chair
around your neck.

50:51.798 --> 50:53.663
But it's 3:00 a.m.
Where do you want me to go?

50:53.734 --> 50:55.895
- Listen, you cheap stenographer...
- Outside, Countess.

50:55.969 --> 50:58.767
As long as they have sidewalks,
you've got a job.

51:02.776 --> 51:04.573
So you're gonna hire detectives.

51:04.644 --> 51:06.703
A fine pair of quarter-wits
I teamed up with.

51:06.780 --> 51:10.011
Every time I get a great idea,
you let Gladstone steal it.

51:10.150 --> 51:12.084
I've got a hunch
you know something about that.

51:12.152 --> 51:14.313
- I don't know a thing.
- What are you gonna do about it?

51:14.387 --> 51:15.445
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.

51:15.522 --> 51:17.990
I'm gonna show that big jerk
three prologues by Saturday night...

51:18.058 --> 51:19.082
and we'll stand him on his ear.

51:19.159 --> 51:21.821
I'll give him the greatest show
since he quit the restaurant business.

51:21.895 --> 51:23.556
In three days?
Where'll you get the people?

51:23.630 --> 51:24.756
Right in our own studio.

51:24.831 --> 51:26.696
Use three choruses
and double up on the principals.

51:26.767 --> 51:27.756
It can't be done.

51:27.834 --> 51:29.961
Give me absolute authority
till Saturday night, I'll do it.

51:30.036 --> 51:31.128
- You've got it!
- You got it!

51:31.204 --> 51:32.262
It's done!

51:33.473 --> 51:36.033
We've gotta have three
of the greatest prologues ever put on.

51:36.109 --> 51:37.371
Now, get this.

51:37.477 --> 51:40.913
Somebody working among us
has been giving Gladstone inside dope.

51:40.981 --> 51:42.414
Selling him my ideas.

51:42.482 --> 51:44.950
And for once, I'm gonna put a stop to it.

51:45.619 --> 51:49.749
Now this is the way we're gonna do it.
Nobody leaves here until Saturday night.

51:50.991 --> 51:52.151
Quiet!

51:52.692 --> 51:54.660
You'll eat here and sleep here.

51:54.728 --> 51:57.458
Live three whole days
right here in the studio.

51:58.165 --> 51:59.393
Quiet!

51:59.800 --> 52:03.930
This is war, a blockade.
Anybody comes in, stays in.

52:04.671 --> 52:06.866
- What do you mean, "stays in"?
- Quiet!

52:07.641 --> 52:10.041
Now this is your last chance to get out.

52:11.144 --> 52:14.136
Well? Anybody wanna go?

52:14.481 --> 52:15.539
No!

52:19.219 --> 52:21.915
All right. Thanks. This is a large order.

52:22.455 --> 52:24.320
Three prologues in three nights.

52:24.825 --> 52:28.386
We're gonna work your heads off.
Curse you and break your hearts.

52:28.562 --> 52:31.554
But by Saturday night,
we'll have what we want.

52:31.631 --> 52:33.531
All right. Hop to it.

52:33.600 --> 52:36.797
This is dangerous, Mr. Gould.
Anything might happen.

52:36.903 --> 52:39.167
Suppose a fire broke out.

52:39.239 --> 52:40.900
Locking us in like this.

52:40.974 --> 52:42.532
He can't do it.

52:50.684 --> 52:52.413
Let me know just as soon as it's done.

52:52.919 --> 52:54.784
Did you check that measure
I told you about?

53:09.302 --> 53:12.362
All girls in this number
to the rehearsal hall.

53:13.006 --> 53:14.530
Come on, girls.

53:15.375 --> 53:16.501
Come on, get ready.

53:22.415 --> 53:24.076
Come on, honey, be reasonable, will you?

53:24.150 --> 53:26.015
She and I are all washed up
and you know it.

53:26.086 --> 53:28.520
Yeah, but does Mrs. Gould know it?

53:29.422 --> 53:32.983
It was awfully nice of you
to bring me in here, really.

53:35.395 --> 53:38.159
Come along, Barrington.
I'll introduce you to the stage director.

53:38.231 --> 53:39.994
Thanks ever so much.

53:43.970 --> 53:45.767
Please sit down right here.

53:49.342 --> 53:51.640
I want you to meet Mr. Barrington.

53:52.012 --> 53:53.912
Here's the man you want to see.

53:54.180 --> 53:55.772
See, what did I tell you?

53:55.849 --> 53:59.216
- It does look like Independence Day.
- Let's celebrate.

54:01.488 --> 54:03.149
Now, there. Look at that.

54:03.223 --> 54:06.056
How can you expect to keep up
a high moral tone with that going on?

54:06.126 --> 54:08.492
I'm awfully glad to have played
love's little messenger...

54:08.561 --> 54:09.721
and brought you two together.

54:09.796 --> 54:11.286
But do you realize
there's work to be done?

54:11.364 --> 54:12.353
Well, we were just...

54:12.432 --> 54:14.696
Would you mind saving about
that much of loving for the act?

54:14.768 --> 54:17.794
We can use it. You're in two prologues.
Miss Thorn, you're in all three.

54:17.871 --> 54:18.929
So how about it?

54:19.005 --> 54:20.870
Is there anything I could do?

54:20.941 --> 54:23.375
- Yeah. See that window over there?
- Yes.

54:23.443 --> 54:26.344
Take a running jump
and I think you can make it.

54:30.450 --> 54:33.544
Come on, fellows, this way.
Bring it down the hall. That's it. That way.

54:33.620 --> 54:35.918
Come on, kids! Come and get it!

54:35.989 --> 54:37.616
Go on, let her go.

54:57.243 --> 54:59.438
I'm terribly worried, Doctor.

55:00.580 --> 55:03.344
- Quiet, will you!
- There's nothing the matter with you.

55:03.416 --> 55:08.080
I feel, Doctor, that I'm gonna have
a dreadful heart attack. You just listen.

55:10.323 --> 55:13.690
Did you hear that? Oh, I am not all right!

55:13.760 --> 55:15.193
That's enough. Who's next?

55:15.261 --> 55:16.853
- I'm next.
- Here.

55:16.930 --> 55:20.661
Three prologues in such a short time.
It can't be done, it can't be done.

55:28.008 --> 55:29.669
Get to bed, girls.

55:36.449 --> 55:39.145
- Good night, kids.
- Good night.

55:49.262 --> 55:52.993
I just wanted to be sure
you're all safe in bed. Good night.

55:53.400 --> 55:55.231
Good night.

55:59.837 --> 56:01.327
Wake up, gang!

56:03.107 --> 56:04.665
When do we eat?

56:04.742 --> 56:07.870
- Truckload of breakfast just arrived.
- All right!

56:07.945 --> 56:09.913
Rehearsal in 20 minutes.

56:17.221 --> 56:18.654
Left, right!

56:20.625 --> 56:23.389
One, two, three, four!

56:24.662 --> 56:26.960
Come on, kids. Come and get it.

56:29.500 --> 56:32.230
One, two, three, four!

56:34.238 --> 56:37.139
One, two, three...

56:37.975 --> 56:38.964
four.

56:41.212 --> 56:42.406
Hello?

56:42.480 --> 56:45.916
I don't care if you wrote the doxology.
Mr. Kent won't see anyone till Monday.

56:45.983 --> 56:48.281
Chester, it's like being in jail.

56:48.352 --> 56:51.810
- Sorry, dear, better get used to it.
- She is used to it.

56:52.223 --> 56:54.350
But how about
our engagement ring, darling?

56:54.425 --> 56:56.450
Get it for you Saturday night.

56:56.527 --> 56:58.085
All right, sweet.

56:58.162 --> 57:01.654
I wouldn't beef about being locked up
with the man I love.

57:06.737 --> 57:09.672
Hello? Yes. Yes, I'll tell him.

57:09.740 --> 57:13.301
Apolinaris says your prologue goes on
at the Jupiter Theatre 9:00 tonight.

57:13.377 --> 57:14.435
How about the other two?

57:14.512 --> 57:16.639
Mercury Theatre at 10:00,
the Diana Theatre at 11:00.

57:16.714 --> 57:18.545
Looks like we're in the laps
of the Greek gods.

57:18.616 --> 57:19.878
- You worried?
- Well...

57:19.951 --> 57:22.784
that water nymph number will
empty the theater like a stench bomb.

57:22.854 --> 57:24.583
There's still time to change it.

57:24.655 --> 57:27.590
It's too late and I'm too tired.

57:27.658 --> 57:30.491
Every time I fool with it,
I ruin it some more.

57:31.929 --> 57:34.762
Old Faithful's gone blank
on me completely.

57:37.468 --> 57:39.959
Hey, wait a minute.
This is Mr. Kent's private office.

57:40.037 --> 57:41.698
How nice. I'm Mrs. Kent.

57:41.772 --> 57:44.206
And I'm Lydia Pinkham. Outside.

57:45.943 --> 57:47.706
Do you know this dizzy dame?

57:47.778 --> 57:51.339
Yeah, I still have nightmares about her.
She used to be my wife.

57:54.051 --> 57:55.985
Still is, Chester, dear.

57:56.854 --> 57:59.414
- You went to Reno.
- I was going.

57:59.624 --> 58:02.650
- Somehow, I never got around to it.
- I see.

58:03.227 --> 58:05.627
- You heard I was in the money.
- Exactly.

58:05.997 --> 58:08.864
- What kept you away so long?
- I was in Europe.

58:09.901 --> 58:12.734
- And who paid for that?
- That's my affair.

58:12.803 --> 58:16.569
I understand you're all steamed up
about a Miss Vivian Rich.

58:18.242 --> 58:21.473
- And what's that to you?
- I can make plenty of trouble.

58:21.546 --> 58:24.913
- All right, come on, come on. How much?
- $25,000 worth.

58:26.050 --> 58:28.917
You might as well ask for $25 million.
I work for a living.

58:28.986 --> 58:31.648
You can have till 4:00 this afternoon.

58:34.659 --> 58:37.184
Then my lawyer and I start shooting.

58:37.662 --> 58:39.152
Wait a minute.

58:43.067 --> 58:45.228
Here's a pass for the cop at the gate.

58:45.303 --> 58:48.170
I wouldn't want you to have
any trouble getting out.

58:53.077 --> 58:54.305
$25,000.

58:58.783 --> 59:00.910
Well, here's where I go to the cleaners.

59:00.985 --> 59:03.146
Maybe I can do something about it.

59:03.788 --> 59:06.985
You mean raise that dough?
What are you gonna do, print it?

59:07.058 --> 59:08.491
Never mind. I've got an idea.

59:08.559 --> 59:10.618
Keep it to yourself
or the wife'll cash in on it.

59:10.695 --> 59:13.596
And when I get an idea
I do something about it.

59:18.069 --> 59:19.559
Most dames do.

59:19.737 --> 59:23.138
<i>By a waterfall</i>

59:23.207 --> 59:26.665
<i>I'm callng you</i>

59:30.881 --> 59:32.246
I want to talk to Scotty.

59:32.316 --> 59:35.513
You can't come in here
and break up my rehearsal this way.

59:35.586 --> 59:38.919
- Mr. Kent's orders.
- Hold it! Come here, Scotty.

59:41.359 --> 59:43.384
Were you on the level
when you said that...

59:43.461 --> 59:45.326
Frazer and Gould
were holding out on Mr. Kent?

59:45.396 --> 59:48.126
- You know Mrs. Gould, she talks a lot.
- Anything we can prove?

59:48.199 --> 59:50.633
Just suspicions, but I sort of
put two and two together.

59:50.701 --> 59:52.293
That's what I'm gonna do and make 25.

59:52.370 --> 59:53.997
Back to your places, girls!

59:54.071 --> 59:56.164
- You've been gypping him for months.
- You're raving.

59:56.240 --> 59:58.868
No, just investigating.
And my knowledge is worth money.

59:58.943 --> 01:00:01.309
It's out and out robbery
and that's a crime in any country.

01:00:01.379 --> 01:00:04.348
- Lf our accountant made a mistake?
- Mr. Kent will let the jury decide.

01:00:06.017 --> 01:00:07.609
<i>Bonjour,</i> darling.

01:00:07.952 --> 01:00:11.251
Just got some tough news, Vivian.
My wife showed up.

01:00:11.856 --> 01:00:13.721
You mean your ex-wife.

01:00:14.392 --> 01:00:17.259
- My wife. She never got the divorce.
- What do you mean?

01:00:17.328 --> 01:00:19.626
Now listen, baby.
It's just one of those things.

01:00:19.697 --> 01:00:20.857
You've gotta be patient.

01:00:20.931 --> 01:00:24.094
- Young lady, you're on the wrong track.
- What do you want?

01:00:24.168 --> 01:00:26.659
To keep my mouth shut? $25,000.

01:00:27.271 --> 01:00:28.329
Blackmail!

01:00:28.406 --> 01:00:30.465
If I tell Kent,
he'll walk out and you know it.

01:00:30.541 --> 01:00:33.669
- You can't bluff us.
- What makes you think I'm bluffing?

01:00:34.545 --> 01:00:35.944
Young woman.

01:00:36.647 --> 01:00:38.205
You see, darling, that's the way it is.

01:00:38.282 --> 01:00:40.375
You promised to marry me
and you're going to marry me.

01:00:40.451 --> 01:00:42.316
But I can't get rid of her.
She wants $25,000.

01:00:42.386 --> 01:00:45.446
Listen, you silly-looking baboon,
who do you think you're running around?

01:00:45.523 --> 01:00:47.388
- Some little punk from the sticks?
- What's this?

01:00:47.458 --> 01:00:50.359
I wrote the book
and I know all the answers.

01:00:52.129 --> 01:00:53.460
Well, well...

01:00:54.498 --> 01:00:57.023
- The cultured Miss Rich.
- Not cultured, just smart.

01:00:57.101 --> 01:01:00.093
Smart enough to sue
and attach everything but your garters.

01:01:01.472 --> 01:01:03.269
That's nice to know.

01:01:04.442 --> 01:01:05.431
Well...

01:01:07.278 --> 01:01:10.008
I'd rather have you sue me than marry me.

01:01:14.251 --> 01:01:16.651
Mr. Kent, there is a Santa Claus.

01:01:17.488 --> 01:01:19.251
$25,000 and made out to you!

01:01:19.323 --> 01:01:21.689
Endorsed to Chester Kent.
Take it and ask no questions.

01:01:21.792 --> 01:01:23.726
There's something phony here.
How'd you get it?

01:01:23.794 --> 01:01:25.455
- Blackmail.
- Come on, spill it.

01:01:25.529 --> 01:01:29.021
I played a pair of deuces
like four aces and they paid.

01:01:29.100 --> 01:01:31.466
Frazer and Gould
have been holding out on me.

01:01:31.535 --> 01:01:33.332
Bookkeeping mistake.

01:01:33.838 --> 01:01:36.636
- Where are you going?
- Where do you think?

01:01:37.108 --> 01:01:38.575
Hello, Chester.

01:01:38.642 --> 01:01:40.610
- So you double-crossed me.
- A book-keeping mistake.

01:01:40.678 --> 01:01:42.407
I slave day and night for you.
What do I get?

01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:44.744
You stab me in the back!
Me, the guy who made this place!

01:01:44.815 --> 01:01:46.976
Killed myself so you chuckle-headed apes
could get rich.

01:01:47.051 --> 01:01:48.075
We'll straighten it out.

01:01:48.152 --> 01:01:50.814
Go and get somebody else
to double-cross.

01:01:51.455 --> 01:01:53.753
- What about Apolinaris?
- Stick him in your rear.

01:01:53.824 --> 01:01:56.452
And that wood nymph prologue
has got no chance the way it stands.

01:01:56.527 --> 01:01:59.985
- What do we do?
- Fix it yourselves, you two wonder men.

01:02:00.931 --> 01:02:03.422
Chester!
Chester, you've gotta stay on the job!

01:02:03.501 --> 01:02:05.833
You can't do this to us! Chester!

01:02:05.903 --> 01:02:08.394
- Just a moment, you can't go out there.
- The orders are wrong.

01:02:08.472 --> 01:02:09.734
Now wait a minute. Listen!

01:02:12.276 --> 01:02:13.334
Cab!

01:02:20.584 --> 01:02:23.382
- Where to, mister?
- Anywhere, just keep going.

01:02:23.454 --> 01:02:25.319
- Let's go back, boss.
- For what?

01:02:25.389 --> 01:02:26.981
They'll never get Apollo if you quit.

01:02:27.057 --> 01:02:29.252
The three of them can open
a peanut stand together.

01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:35.162
No! No! No! Wait a minute.

01:02:35.399 --> 01:02:36.593
Try it again.

01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:39.397
Hey, Mr. Francis, Kent has quit.

01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:40.960
- What?
- He can't do that.

01:02:41.038 --> 01:02:43.336
He took the brains
on the drive with him under his hat.

01:02:43.407 --> 01:02:46.706
I knew it couldn't be done.
I knew it couldn't be done.

01:02:46.777 --> 01:02:48.267
Let's go home.

01:02:51.982 --> 01:02:56.351
When Apolinaris hears, he wouldn't sign
if we gave him Garbo on roller skates.

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.752
Prologues, prologues, prologues.

01:02:59.323 --> 01:03:00.688
I'm fed up.

01:03:00.891 --> 01:03:04.258
Fighting for ideas and chained
to that office, morning, noon and night.

01:03:04.328 --> 01:03:06.956
And the third prologue, it's rotten.

01:03:07.198 --> 01:03:08.722
But boss...

01:03:10.601 --> 01:03:11.829
Pull up!

01:03:21.212 --> 01:03:25.046
Hey, lend me that brush, will you?
Just a minute. Lend me that.

01:03:31.922 --> 01:03:35.289
Hey, wait a minute! Hey!
Wait a minute! Hey, you!

01:03:35.359 --> 01:03:38.021
Wait, wait. Wait a minute.
What do you think you're trying to do?

01:03:38.095 --> 01:03:40.063
That's my name
and I don't want it up there.

01:03:40.130 --> 01:03:42.428
- Yeah, you're full of hooch, are you?
- Let go.

01:03:44.468 --> 01:03:45.935
Look at that.

01:03:48.873 --> 01:03:51.205
That's what that
wood nymph prologue needs.

01:03:51.742 --> 01:03:54.768
A mountain waterfall
splashing on beautiful white bodies.

01:03:59.316 --> 01:04:02.513
- You get it?
- I have ideas, too, Mr. Kent.

01:04:02.586 --> 01:04:05.020
- All right, well, come on!
- Yeah, come on.

01:04:09.059 --> 01:04:12.586
Sorry, gents. Without Kent
your prologues ain't worth a nickel.

01:04:12.663 --> 01:04:14.221
He's coming back in a little while.

01:04:14.298 --> 01:04:17.631
I can't wait very long.
I've got a date with the Gladstone.

01:04:22.673 --> 01:04:25.870
Where do you think you're going?
Come on, get back in! Everybody back in!

01:04:25.943 --> 01:04:27.205
Come on.

01:04:29.246 --> 01:04:31.771
Hold everything. Everybody stand by.

01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:34.010
Lock that gate. Nobody in, nobody out.

01:04:34.084 --> 01:04:35.574
- Same as before?
- Same as before.

01:04:35.653 --> 01:04:38.121
Listen, get back to work.
That third prologue has changed.

01:04:38.188 --> 01:04:39.348
All the dance routines are shifted.

01:04:39.423 --> 01:04:40.549
Only this time, it's gonna be good.

01:04:40.624 --> 01:04:42.387
I'll be with you in a minute.
Go on, get to work.

01:04:42.459 --> 01:04:45.394
That's impossible, Mr. Kent.
It can't be done!

01:04:45.462 --> 01:04:47.953
All right, children,
back to the rehearsal hall.

01:04:48.032 --> 01:04:50.398
It can't be done. No, it can't be done.

01:04:51.068 --> 01:04:52.899
Look, smallpox, I got the money.

01:04:52.970 --> 01:04:55.200
But I want a release.
Here, give her that when she signs.

01:04:55.272 --> 01:04:58.332
I won't take a check.
You'll stop payment on it.

01:04:58.409 --> 01:04:59.899
Throw her a herring.

01:04:59.977 --> 01:05:01.808
Say, that gives me an idea.

01:05:01.879 --> 01:05:04.347
How about shiny fish
jumping out of the water?

01:05:04.415 --> 01:05:06.144
Swell. Come around Friday.

01:05:06.216 --> 01:05:07.706
Say, listen...

01:05:09.687 --> 01:05:12.053
What's this? I thought you quit!

01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:14.487
- Everything's off.
- It's on.

01:05:14.558 --> 01:05:16.685
Here's your customer.
Got him on the way out. Hold onto him.

01:05:16.760 --> 01:05:18.159
Keep him here
if you have to tie an anchor to him.

01:05:18.228 --> 01:05:19.320
I'll see you later.

01:05:19.396 --> 01:05:22.058
- What about that accounting mistake?
- Mistake, your Aunt Fannie.

01:05:22.132 --> 01:05:24.965
- We're giving you a new deal.
- Yeah, and I'm the dealer.

01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:27.630
Mr. Kent.

01:05:28.906 --> 01:05:32.205
- Do you like to look at funny pictures?
- What do you mean?

01:05:37.848 --> 01:05:40.339
I hope it looks as good as it sounds.

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.694
Well, well, just folks.

01:05:52.563 --> 01:05:54.724
Don't mind us.
We just dropped in for a laugh.

01:05:54.798 --> 01:05:56.891
- This is all a mistake.
- Right, sister, and you're it.

01:05:56.967 --> 01:06:00.733
I was just showing Miss Rich
what you can't do in Kalamazoo.

01:06:00.971 --> 01:06:02.495
You won't need that lawyer.

01:06:02.573 --> 01:06:05.133
Your breach of promise suit
is right in the ash can.

01:06:05.209 --> 01:06:07.074
And you're my witness.

01:06:10.914 --> 01:06:13.405
I certainly have a genius
for picking dames to fall for.

01:06:13.484 --> 01:06:16.282
- You said it, papa.
- Maybe you better help me next time.

01:06:16.353 --> 01:06:18.446
What do you think I've been doing?

01:06:35.039 --> 01:06:38.566
Mr. Kent, seeing all these girls
gives me a lot of ideas.

01:06:38.642 --> 01:06:41.110
- And don't let them keep you awake.
- No.

01:06:41.345 --> 01:06:44.314
Look, suppose I quit my job
and work for you?

01:06:44.381 --> 01:06:47.282
Wait till Saturday.
I may be working for you.

01:06:50.587 --> 01:06:54.216
Hold it! That's where your song comes in!

01:06:54.291 --> 01:06:57.317
- How's Barrington?
- I'm a little worried.

01:06:57.394 --> 01:06:59.123
Only a little worried? He must be colossal.

01:06:59.196 --> 01:07:01.221
He is, but maybe he'll improve.

01:07:01.298 --> 01:07:03.027
Well, you can start worrying
all over again.

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:05.125
All the stuff you've done
in this prologue is out.

01:07:05.202 --> 01:07:06.965
Here's the new stuff
and it goes on tonight.

01:07:07.071 --> 01:07:10.973
No. No. This is the straw
that breaks the camel's back.

01:07:11.075 --> 01:07:14.135
Mr. Kent, I cannot and I will not
try the impossible.

01:07:14.211 --> 01:07:15.803
Come on, baby, wind yourself up.

01:07:15.879 --> 01:07:19.371
After all, I'm only a human being.
I'm not a superman.

01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:22.112
And even if I were, it couldn't be done.

01:07:22.186 --> 01:07:24.586
Mr. Kent, I resign.

01:07:25.522 --> 01:07:27.717
I accept. You're through.

01:07:27.791 --> 01:07:29.156
You accept?

01:07:29.226 --> 01:07:32.127
Do you realize
that leaves me without a job?

01:07:32.629 --> 01:07:35.826
And after I've worked myself
to the bone for you?

01:07:35.899 --> 01:07:38.459
Come on, kids.
I'm putting this prologue on myself.

01:07:38.535 --> 01:07:40.503
Line up. You're through.

01:07:43.073 --> 01:07:44.870
All right kids, come on.

01:07:48.579 --> 01:07:50.376
Come on, girls. Hurry, girls!

01:07:50.447 --> 01:07:52.972
Hurry, please!
The bus leaves in 10 minutes.

01:07:53.050 --> 01:07:54.074
Will you hurry?

01:08:22.212 --> 01:08:24.840
Come on, girls, hurry up! Step it up!

01:08:28.218 --> 01:08:30.948
I ate my dinner too fast. I got indigestion.

01:08:32.421 --> 01:08:33.684
Come on!

01:08:35.959 --> 01:08:37.654
In here! In here!

01:08:38.428 --> 01:08:40.487
Here, girls. Take it away!

01:08:47.304 --> 01:08:50.501
<i>How am I to say what I want to say</i>

01:08:50.573 --> 01:08:53.008
<i>In the proper way, my dear?</i>

01:08:53.076 --> 01:08:56.068
<i>I'm not a gallant cavaler</i>

01:08:56.613 --> 01:08:59.776
<i>But I'm sncere</i>

01:09:00.216 --> 01:09:03.550
<i>So I'm gonna say what I have to say</i>

01:09:03.620 --> 01:09:06.350
<i>In the language of the day</i>

01:09:06.423 --> 01:09:09.756
<i>You may have heard t all before</i>

01:09:09.993 --> 01:09:14.487
<i>But here t goes once more</i>

01:09:15.265 --> 01:09:17.961
<i>How about a lttle celebraton</i>

01:09:18.801 --> 01:09:21.292
<i>To the jngle of a weddng bell?</i>

01:09:22.072 --> 01:09:24.540
<i>How about a lttle reservaton</i>

01:09:24.875 --> 01:09:27.867
<i>At the Honeymoon Hotel?</i>

01:09:28.645 --> 01:09:31.307
<i>Honeymoonng's gonna be my hobby</i>

01:09:31.881 --> 01:09:34.510
<i>Don't you thnk a honeymoon s swell?</i>

01:09:35.185 --> 01:09:37.779

Don't worry, boss. Joe will do his best.

01:29:39.355 --> 01:29:41.186
He'll have to do better than that.

01:29:48.898 --> 01:29:50.195
Well, this tells the story.

01:29:50.266 --> 01:29:52.131
Cheer up, boss.
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:29:52.201 --> 01:29:54.999
You stick close to Apolinaris
and keep feeding him bicarbonate.

01:29:55.071 --> 01:29:57.767
I've got to give Barrington a pep talk.

01:29:58.474 --> 01:30:01.102
Hello, Mr. Apolinaris. Enjoying yourself?

01:30:01.177 --> 01:30:02.974
I shouldn't have ate pie and salami.

01:30:03.045 --> 01:30:07.277
- Oh, let me get you some bicarbonates.

01:30:08.751 --> 01:30:11.117
Honey, how about a prologue honeymoon?

01:30:11.187 --> 01:30:13.553

01:30:13.622 --> 01:30:16.557
And then start all over again.
If Apollo signs.

01:30:16.625 --> 01:30:18.058

I can't do it. I tell you I can't.

01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:01.062
I've only appeared
in amateur performances.

01:31:01.537 --> 01:31:03.402
- An amateur!
- Yes, sir.

01:31:04.106 --> 01:31:06.233
Well, I might have known it.

That's our call, you go on.

01:31:13.649 --> 01:31:16.083
If it's cold you go back
to that amateur league on crutches.

01:31:16.152 --> 01:31:18.780
- I'm too nervous.
- Get on! Get out there and do it!

01:31:18.854 --> 01:31:21.982
- I can't do it. I tell you I'm sick.
- I'll wrap this around your neck.

01:31:26.729 --> 01:31:29.197
- What do you want to do, boss?
- Bring up that curtain!

01:31:29.265 --> 01:31:31.790
Bring it up, Joe. Places, everybody!

01:31:35.804 --> 01:31:36.998
All right, that's you!

01:31:37.072 --> 01:31:39.563
- No, I can't! I won't go on!
- You better go on!

01:32:05.868 --> 01:32:08.302
Looking for your Shanghai Lil?

01:32:20.983 --> 01:32:23.508
No, she ain't your Shanghai Lil.

01:32:32.528 --> 01:32:34.291
Don't give him flowers.

01:32:34.363 --> 01:32:38.265
He'll just take your flowers
straight to Shanghai Lil.

01:32:51.914 --> 01:32:54.382
No, I ain't seen Shanghai Lil.

01:33:01.090 --> 01:33:04.787
Hello, Bailey, you old goon.
Where'd you get that monkey suit?

01:33:04.860 --> 01:33:07.761
Don't tell anyone you saw me

01:33:07.830 --> 01:33:10.060

Now what's your game?
