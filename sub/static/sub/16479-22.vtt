WEBVTT

00:01.302 --> 00:03.102
So, I've got it all planned out.
I'm gonna surprise Nick

00:03.104 --> 00:04.803
at his book reading,
and afterwards,

00:04.805 --> 00:08.240
when he's on a big high,
I'm gonna tell him how I feel.

00:08.242 --> 00:10.676
You think this is a little soon
after the breakup with Reagan?

00:10.678 --> 00:12.011
Yeah.
Yeah.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.946
I'm worried, very worried.
(chuckles)

00:13.948 --> 00:15.814
But you know what, I wrote
everything out on the plane,

00:15.816 --> 00:16.915
like what I'm gonna say.

00:16.917 --> 00:19.018
It's all on flash cards,
some of it's in song,

00:19.020 --> 00:21.653
I would do it for you,
but some of the jokes

00:21.655 --> 00:23.522
are at your expense,
so, uh...
(chuckles)

00:23.524 --> 00:26.258
Jess, why don't you just
tell him how you feel?

00:26.260 --> 00:29.495
You know, no jokes, no songs,
just from the heart.

00:29.497 --> 00:31.964
(laughs)

00:31.966 --> 00:34.166
No songs.
(laughs)
Yeah.

00:34.168 --> 00:35.234
No songs.

00:35.236 --> 00:37.736
No songs, she said.

00:37.738 --> 00:39.071
NICK:
<i> "Pepperwood lay on the ground</i>

00:39.073 --> 00:41.173
"in a puddle of blood.

00:41.175 --> 00:44.576
"Jessica Night broke through the
barricades and ran to his side.

00:44.578 --> 00:46.345
"'Even though he doesn't
have muscles,

00:46.347 --> 00:49.281
"he seems incredibly strong,'
Jessica thought,

00:49.283 --> 00:51.583
"as she looked into his
perfect, sexy face.

00:51.585 --> 00:53.819
"Even now, even covered

00:53.821 --> 00:56.522
"in the blood of the man
they both knew as Schmith,

00:56.524 --> 01:00.359
"the two sat in silence
in the hot, New Orleans night,

01:00.361 --> 01:03.328
waiting for the words
that would never come."

01:03.330 --> 01:07.032
(audience whoops and cheers)

01:08.903 --> 01:11.470
I'm gonna open up the floor
to some questions.

01:11.472 --> 01:13.672
Uh, the young lady right here
in the strange-looking vest.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.673
No offense.

01:14.675 --> 01:15.841
When are Pepperwood

01:15.843 --> 01:17.276
and Jessica Night
going to get together?

01:17.278 --> 01:19.178
WOMAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That is a great question.

01:19.180 --> 01:21.146
(audience muttering)

01:21.148 --> 01:23.282
I'll just cut to it, guys.

01:23.284 --> 01:27.653
Uh, Pepperwood and Jessica Night
will never get together. Never.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.955
(low murmuring)

01:29.957 --> 01:31.190
I'm sorry. You guys, stop.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.492
It's just, look,
these characters,

01:33.494 --> 01:35.661
they-they are based
off real people.

01:35.663 --> 01:39.965
A-And the real people are
just fundamentally different.

01:39.967 --> 01:42.167
They don't work together.

01:42.169 --> 01:44.069
It's just never gonna happen.

01:44.071 --> 01:46.171
You just got to forget about it.
Excuse me.

01:46.173 --> 01:47.573
Move on from it.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.178
And also, you know,
Pepperwood, he blew it.

01:53.180 --> 01:55.647
Sometimes you don't get
another chance, you know,

01:55.649 --> 01:56.982
to-to fix the mistake.

01:56.984 --> 01:58.817
It's just... look,
adult relationships

01:58.819 --> 01:59.818
are really complicated.

01:59.820 --> 02:02.354
So, let's hear it for books!

02:04.158 --> 02:07.259
All right, wow, you guys
are super intense.

02:07.261 --> 02:09.595
♪ ♪

02:12.299 --> 02:13.465
Hi.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.501
I'm Merle Streep.
I don't care.

02:15.503 --> 02:19.138
Okay. Um, I'm an editor and
I publish children's books,

02:19.140 --> 02:20.305
so I wanted...
Oh, congratulations to you.

02:20.307 --> 02:21.573
What would you like me
to do about that?

02:21.575 --> 02:22.908
Uh, I'm about
to make a call, so...

02:22.910 --> 02:24.910
Nice to meet you,
Merle Streep.

02:24.912 --> 02:25.911
(line ringing)
Goofy name.

02:25.913 --> 02:28.080
I'll... I'll... okay.
Okay.

02:28.082 --> 02:29.581
(ringing)

02:35.789 --> 02:37.022
Hey, Nick.

02:37.024 --> 02:39.992
Hey, this is crazy,
but were you just at my reading?

02:39.994 --> 02:41.660
You're not in L.A., are you?

02:41.662 --> 02:43.662
No, I'm in Portland with my dad.

02:43.664 --> 02:44.696
That's what I thought.

02:44.698 --> 02:45.664
How'd the reading go?

02:45.666 --> 02:47.132
<i> Couldn't have gone better.</i>

02:47.134 --> 02:48.667
I felt weirdly
comfortable up there.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.335
I'm so proud of you.

02:50.337 --> 02:51.403
Thanks.

02:54.175 --> 02:55.908
Reagan and I broke up.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.609
I got to go.

02:57.611 --> 02:59.578
<i> Oh, my dad just sprained his</i>

02:59.580 --> 03:01.813
thumb trying to get up
off a couch.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.483
<i> I'll talk to you later, Nick.</i>

03:04.485 --> 03:07.119
Sorry. So, is now a good
time to talk to you?

03:07.121 --> 03:08.620
Because I'd like to talk to you
about publishing your book.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.022
You'd like to talk
to me about what?

03:10.024 --> 03:11.190
Publishing your book.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.958
What are you,
some kind of a-a publisher?

03:12.960 --> 03:14.259
Yeah, that's what my card...

03:14.261 --> 03:15.594
I was trying to give
you my card, but you...

03:15.596 --> 03:17.262
You want to publish my book?
Yeah.

03:17.264 --> 03:19.364
Yeah, I want you
to publish my book.

03:19.366 --> 03:21.867
Is this how you normally are?
No.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.669
(humming)

03:23.671 --> 03:25.337
(whoops) Babe, hi.

03:25.339 --> 03:27.072
Are your pants off?

03:27.074 --> 03:29.141
I... I went
to the reading and...

03:29.143 --> 03:30.175
Oh, no, what happened?

03:30.177 --> 03:31.743
I'm so sorry
I'm not wearing pants.

03:31.745 --> 03:33.178
Schmidt's been
so busy with work,

03:33.180 --> 03:35.247
we scheduled
a no-pants dinner thing.

03:35.249 --> 03:38.016
Do you want me
to take my pants off, too?

03:38.018 --> 03:39.017
Oh, no, honey.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.285
Tell me everything.

03:40.287 --> 03:42.187
ALY:<i> That's it.</i>
<i> I'm all moved in.</i>

03:42.189 --> 03:45.624
This is my last box and it's
labeled "holiday important."

03:45.626 --> 03:47.693
So, it's definitely sex toys.

03:47.695 --> 03:50.195
(laughs) Well, then
I wonder what's in this box.

03:50.197 --> 03:53.098
It's labeled "documents."
Eh, it's just documents.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.000
(chuckles)
Oh, no, no, no.
That's nothing.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.001
I...

03:56.003 --> 03:58.170
Wait, wait, wait.

03:58.172 --> 04:00.806
You have a mug shot
of the diaper bandit?

04:00.808 --> 04:02.808
With a phone number on the back?
All right.

04:02.810 --> 04:05.811
Listen, I-I wanted to wait for
the right time to tell you this.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.145
Have you been keeping in touch
with the diaper bandit?

04:07.147 --> 04:10.015
What? No.
No, listen. I...

04:10.017 --> 04:13.552
That's actually
your dad's phone number.

04:15.289 --> 04:18.991
You said you wanted
to find him, so...

04:18.993 --> 04:20.058
I found him.

04:27.134 --> 04:29.101
(whispering):
My dad is the diaper bandit?

04:29.103 --> 04:30.636
No.
Oh.

04:30.638 --> 04:33.171
Forget about the diaper bandit.
That'd have been weird.

04:42.916 --> 04:43.982
SCHMIDT:
Cece.

04:43.984 --> 04:47.853
(singsongy):
I'm not wearing any pants.

04:47.855 --> 04:48.854
(whispering): Honey.

04:48.856 --> 04:51.089
(screaming)
Oh, no! Oh, no!

04:51.091 --> 04:52.357
I touched one
of your breasts!

04:52.359 --> 04:54.593
Where is my wife?!
I can never be the same!

04:54.595 --> 04:55.961
(both panting)

04:55.963 --> 04:57.929
Let's just move on.
I'm fine.
No, it's fine.

04:57.931 --> 05:00.432
I panicked, and I told him
I was in Portland,

05:00.434 --> 05:02.267
and now I can't go back
to the loft.

05:02.269 --> 05:03.602
To play devil's advocate,

05:03.604 --> 05:06.104
he was just talking
about characters in his novel.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.806
I mean, look,
the character based on me

05:07.808 --> 05:10.776
is a Jewish psychopath
who wears a bolo tie

05:10.778 --> 05:13.178
and eats applesauce
out of a baboon's skull.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.946
No, he was talking about us.

05:14.948 --> 05:17.616
He just doesn't feel
the way I feel.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.785
I... I can't see him.

05:19.787 --> 05:22.654
Hey, it's me, Nick.
In three, two...

05:22.656 --> 05:23.922
Hang on, wrong key.
SCHMIDT:
Get in the kitchen.

05:23.924 --> 05:25.490
Go, shoo, scram.
NICK: That was for
my chest drawer.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.428
Got it.
SCHMIDT:
My man.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.596
(Nick sighs)

05:31.598 --> 05:33.432
I don't love this couch.

05:33.434 --> 05:34.833
Did you take
the tags off already?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.868
It's the perfect couch.
What are you doing here?

05:36.870 --> 05:38.804
Well, I need to talk to you and
my phone's only at five percent.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.439
Well, why didn't you...
I can't find the charger.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.107
It's under Winston's pillow.
I looked in Winston's room.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.576
Did you look under the pillow?
Yeah, yeah. I... yeah.

05:44.578 --> 05:45.977
I went in there. I...
No, you didn't.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.146
I didn't look in Winston's room,
but I need to talk to you.

05:48.148 --> 05:49.915
An editor wants
to publish my book.

05:49.917 --> 05:52.117
Pass immediately
and start a bidding war.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.852
I'm getting ahead
of myself. Mazel.

05:53.854 --> 05:55.087
That's incredible, Nick.

05:55.089 --> 05:57.189
Thanks. I called Jess,
but she didn't answer.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.591
I was really hoping to tell her
about it, but she hung up

05:59.593 --> 06:01.193
on me earlier and now she
won't pick up the phone.

06:01.195 --> 06:03.695
What are you doing?
Shh! Shh, shh!

06:03.697 --> 06:05.664
(whispering):
What, what, what?

06:05.666 --> 06:07.666
Oh, Nick's here?
Shh! You're yelling.

06:07.668 --> 06:09.034
I'm not yelling.
You're yelling.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.202
You're coming with me
to the meeting tomorrow.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.037
(phone beeps)
I'm picking you up
at 9:00 a.m.

06:13.607 --> 06:14.639
I have to go to the kitchen.

06:14.641 --> 06:15.607
I'll come with. I'm starving.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.242
No.
Where are you...

06:17.244 --> 06:18.877
Come to the kitchen
with me then, Nick.

06:20.447 --> 06:22.080
(whispering):
Wait, why are you crawling?

06:22.082 --> 06:24.149
(whispering):
I don't know. Just go.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.953
(groans)

06:27.955 --> 06:29.921
Hey, do you have any
angel hair pasta in here?
(phone beeps)

06:29.923 --> 06:31.123
I don't see it.
Ooh, you know what?

06:31.125 --> 06:33.058
Uh, excuse me, I have
to go to the bedroom now.

06:34.762 --> 06:36.194
(quietly):
Jess, this is very stressful.

06:36.196 --> 06:38.597
I know. Look, tomorrow, you need
to go to that meeting with Nick

06:38.599 --> 06:40.932
and you need to stay with him
until I'm packed.

06:40.934 --> 06:43.001
Whoa, whoa, whoa, packed?
I just army-crawled

06:43.003 --> 06:45.504
across your entire house to get
away from my ex-boyfriend...

06:46.273 --> 06:48.173
...who I still live with.

06:48.175 --> 06:50.675
I-I-I can't do
this anymore.

06:50.677 --> 06:53.412
I need, I need to get out
of here and get some space.

06:55.315 --> 06:56.915
I'm moving out of the loft.

06:56.917 --> 06:58.049
What?

07:00.854 --> 07:02.687
I couldn't find
your trash bin,

07:02.689 --> 07:03.755
so I threw it away
in the toilet.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.923
What'd you throw in the toilet?

07:04.925 --> 07:06.458
The, uh, salami in the fridge.
What?

07:06.460 --> 07:07.926
I didn't flush it.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.528
So, you're gonna have
a bunch of salami

07:09.530 --> 07:12.330
floating around
in your toilet bowl.
What?

07:15.502 --> 07:16.768
So Jess is just moving out

07:16.770 --> 07:19.137
because Nick said
something dumb at a reading?

07:19.139 --> 07:21.506
Nick is always dumb.
He's the dumbest boy in school.

07:21.508 --> 07:22.774
I had no idea you cared
so much about

07:22.776 --> 07:24.342
what happens to Nick and Jess.

07:24.344 --> 07:25.811
How could I not?
I've been watching these idiots

07:25.813 --> 07:27.779
do this dance
for the last six years.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.781
He's rough and tumble.
She's sweet and sassy.

07:29.783 --> 07:32.117
It's the moon and the tides,
it's the push and the pull.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.152
I know, it just
makes so much sense.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.254
I'm gonna go tell him
that she loves him.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.622
I'm gonna go
tell him that she loves him,

07:37.624 --> 07:38.924
I'm gonna burst in the door,
and I'm gonna say,

07:38.926 --> 07:40.258
"Nick, she loves you,"
and then...

07:40.260 --> 07:42.427
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We cannot get involved.

07:42.429 --> 07:44.129
Okay.
Okay?

07:44.131 --> 07:46.832
You're right.
You're right, okay.
All right. Okay.

07:46.834 --> 07:47.933
(both sigh)

07:47.935 --> 07:50.769
I should've worn shorts.
No, no.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.337
I would've looked
amazing in shorts.

07:52.339 --> 07:54.973
I got rid of all the shorts,
you nutball.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.175
You are really grumpy
this morning.

07:57.177 --> 08:00.946
Well, I was up late last night,
talking to Cece about you.

08:00.948 --> 08:02.981
For what?
Nick, I want
to tell you something,

08:02.983 --> 08:06.351
but... but I can't.

08:06.353 --> 08:08.019
So I'm just gonna
ask you this:

08:08.021 --> 08:10.155
why on earth

08:10.157 --> 08:13.825
do you think that you are so
okay with this Reagan breakup?

08:13.827 --> 08:15.760
Reagan and I are at
different places of our life.

08:15.762 --> 08:17.796
It's fine. Why hasn't
Jess called me back?

08:17.798 --> 08:18.997
You guys are
pretty good friends, right?

08:18.999 --> 08:20.632
But if you remember
correctly,

08:20.634 --> 08:22.767
you didn't even want Jess
to move in to the loft.

08:22.769 --> 08:24.202
Nick, why do you think that is?

08:24.204 --> 08:26.304
I'm pretty freaked out
by sanitary napkins.

08:26.306 --> 08:28.907
Why don't you think you wanted
Jess to move in to the loft?

08:28.909 --> 08:31.743
I don't know, 'cause I,
'cause I was afraid.

08:31.745 --> 08:34.579
Nick, you have been
in love with this girl

08:34.581 --> 08:36.114
from the moment
you opened the door

08:36.116 --> 08:39.084
and you first
laid eyes on her.

08:39.086 --> 08:42.587
I have never seen you
look at anyone else like that

08:42.589 --> 08:43.855
in my entire life.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.824
Except maybe,
on a few occasions, me.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.859
I've never looked at you
the same way I look at Jess.

08:47.861 --> 08:49.861
There's just been a few times.
I-- there's never been a time.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.496
You looked at Coach
maybe once or twice like that.

08:51.498 --> 08:53.031
Me, several times.
Winston, never.

08:53.033 --> 08:54.032
Let's table it.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.634
You're wrong.

08:55.636 --> 08:58.203
The first time I saw Jess
was I was standing

08:58.205 --> 09:00.605
in her empty room, and I was
looking out the window.

09:00.607 --> 09:02.474
She was trying to get
in the building.
Okay.

09:02.476 --> 09:04.142
Pretty hilarious.
She didn't have her glasses on,

09:04.144 --> 09:05.677
and she was bumping into stuff.

09:05.679 --> 09:07.512
Will you listen
to yourself?

09:07.514 --> 09:11.683
I shouldn't be telling
you this, but...

09:11.685 --> 09:13.952
Jess is not in Portland.
She's here.

09:13.954 --> 09:16.021
And she's packing up
her stuff because

09:16.023 --> 09:17.322
she's going to move out
of the loft

09:17.324 --> 09:19.491
for good.
Nick.

09:19.493 --> 09:21.259
Wait, she's gonna
move out of the loft?

09:21.261 --> 09:24.229
For once in your life,
don't be afraid.

09:26.633 --> 09:28.099
Ready to come in and talk?

09:32.539 --> 09:35.974
Hello. I'm, uh, Winston Schmidt,
Nick's associate.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.242
That's right.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.811
Children's literature
just got a brand-new daddy.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.246
What?

09:41.248 --> 09:44.115
Children's literature
just got a brand-new daddy.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.918
Don't say that here anymore,
okay? Thank you.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.122
So sorry I'm late,

09:51.124 --> 09:54.292
but Sadie would not stop
going on about her divorce,

09:54.294 --> 09:55.493
and I was like,
"Girl, can you just be quiet

09:55.495 --> 09:56.962
and look at my vagina, please?"

09:56.964 --> 09:58.363
The fact that we have
the same gynecologist

09:58.365 --> 09:59.764
really makes me
feel closer to you.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.666
Wait, is this all you have
packed? I mean, Nick's gonna

10:01.668 --> 10:03.668
be here in two hours.
I know.

10:03.670 --> 10:05.170
Hey. You know what?

10:05.172 --> 10:07.806
If this is too hard right now,
you don't have to do this.

10:07.808 --> 10:10.809
Just give yourself some time
and think it through.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.978
If my stuff is here, I'll just
end up living here again.

10:12.980 --> 10:15.246
You know me; I live
where my stuff lives.

10:15.248 --> 10:16.448
When I come back

10:16.450 --> 10:19.150
for the school year,
I'll... find a new place.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.286
All right.
Well, if we're gonna do this,

10:21.288 --> 10:22.487
then we better get moving.

10:22.489 --> 10:24.122
Yep. My God, I'm gonna
miss you so much.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.757
I'm gonna miss you so much, too.

10:25.759 --> 10:27.092
But it's just one summer.
It's fine.

10:27.094 --> 10:28.593
Okay, I know,
but I'm just gonna miss you.

10:28.595 --> 10:31.129
Me, too. This is dumb!
It's one summer.

10:31.131 --> 10:33.198
It's one summer.
It's fine. We can get
through one summer.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.466
It's fine.
I'm gonna miss you,
like, day-to-day.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.034
Who am I gonna
talk to every day?

10:38.939 --> 10:41.406
Mine, mine...
Is this mine?

10:41.408 --> 10:42.574
Are you collecting things
for Goodwill?

10:42.576 --> 10:44.809
I'm not donating things,
I'm moving out.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.910
BOTH:
What?

10:45.912 --> 10:47.278
Look, I'm just going to Portland

10:47.280 --> 10:48.680
for the summer to get away.

10:48.682 --> 10:51.016
Sure. You go to Portland,
have a fun summer,

10:51.018 --> 10:52.684
but then what
about after that?

10:52.686 --> 10:54.686
Huh? When will
we see you?

10:54.688 --> 10:57.022
Who will your friends be?
Who you gonna hang out with?

10:57.024 --> 10:58.657
Okay, think about the people
you are leaving behind.

10:58.659 --> 11:01.192
Also, side note, Aly
has my dad's number!

11:01.194 --> 11:02.327
Okay.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.162
Wait, what?
I got his dad's number.

11:04.164 --> 11:05.664
My dad's name is
Van, by the way.

11:05.666 --> 11:08.166
Oh, my God, Winston,
that's a huge deal!

11:08.168 --> 11:10.001
Yeah. Yeah.
Are you gonna call him?

11:13.807 --> 11:15.273
No.

11:15.942 --> 11:17.175
I can't call my dad.

11:17.177 --> 11:18.476
I just can't.

11:18.478 --> 11:20.745
You know what?
You don't have to call him

11:20.747 --> 11:22.247
if you don't want to.
You can always just

11:22.249 --> 11:25.417
escape to Portland-- oh, my God!

11:25.419 --> 11:26.951
You can come with me
to Portland!

11:26.953 --> 11:28.620
Furgie's gonna love it.

11:28.622 --> 11:30.088
It's the second most
cat-friendly Portland

11:30.090 --> 11:32.023
after Portland, Maine,
according to<i> Paws</i> magazine.

11:32.025 --> 11:33.191
Are you going
to Portland?

11:33.193 --> 11:34.426
No.

11:34.428 --> 11:36.261
Portland is hella white.

11:36.263 --> 11:39.164
(phone ringing)

11:39.166 --> 11:41.366
Ooh. (chuckles) Sadie.

11:41.368 --> 11:42.934
Hello.

11:42.936 --> 11:45.704
(singsongy):
Cece, you're pregnant.

11:51.745 --> 11:54.512
Oh, my God, Cece's pregnant.

11:54.514 --> 11:56.815
Why are you picking up
someone else's phone?

11:56.817 --> 11:58.450
Call back in five minutes,
and we will agree

11:58.452 --> 12:00.819
to lie to our friend
for the rest of our lives.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.520
Oh, God.
You're gonna be in my office

12:02.522 --> 12:03.755
throughout the pregnancy,
aren't you?

12:03.757 --> 12:04.923
(door closes)

12:04.925 --> 12:06.791
So I am double-parked,
so if you got any boxes

12:06.793 --> 12:07.992
I can take down to the car.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.463
What's up?
Why are you so happy?

12:11.465 --> 12:13.998
I just love boxes so much.

12:14.000 --> 12:15.100
Can I have one
to take to the car?

12:15.102 --> 12:17.035
It's heavy.
I'm fine.

12:17.037 --> 12:19.037
Oh, okay. We can go together.
That's fine.

12:19.039 --> 12:20.772
I-I like quality time.

12:20.774 --> 12:22.440
(phone ringing)

12:22.442 --> 12:24.342
Oh, you should go
get your phone.
No, no, no.

12:24.344 --> 12:25.777
Let's just get this box down.

12:25.779 --> 12:27.445
Okay.
Hey, can someone
grab my phone?

12:27.447 --> 12:29.814
What if it's about
your booming model business?

12:29.816 --> 12:31.483
ALY:
<i> Hello?</i>

12:31.485 --> 12:33.017
Cece, you're pregnant!

12:33.019 --> 12:35.954
Oh, my God, Cece's pregnant!
Who the hell is this?

12:35.956 --> 12:38.490
Cece's pregnant?
Sorry. I-I'm Aly,
Winston's fiancée.

12:38.492 --> 12:39.691
Cece is pregnant?

12:39.693 --> 12:41.092
Winston's married to Cece.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.293
Winston Bishop.
Cece's pregnant.

12:42.295 --> 12:43.762
Cece's pregnant. Oh, my God,

12:43.764 --> 12:45.196
Cece's pregnant, everybody!
Oh, my God.

12:45.198 --> 12:48.099
(laughs)
No need to yell.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.367
Tell Cece to call me.

12:49.369 --> 12:51.035
Got to head back down
in the mine.

12:51.037 --> 12:53.872
Hey, can we hustle? I got a
hair appointment in an hour.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.774
It's a real upstairs,
downstairs kind of day.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.208
Gotcha.

13:00.413 --> 13:01.946
(ringing)

13:01.948 --> 13:04.482
What, Winston?
I'm using social media.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.850
Oh, my God, Schmidt.
Why didn't you

13:05.852 --> 13:08.653
tell me you were
gonna be a papa?
No, no, no, no.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.088
What do you mean, "papa"?
What are you talking about?

13:10.090 --> 13:11.956
Pull the plug.
Sadie told Aly
that Cece is pregnant.

13:11.958 --> 13:12.957
Pull the... pull the plug.

13:12.959 --> 13:13.925
What? Why would she do that?

13:13.927 --> 13:15.160
'Cause she pregnant.

13:15.162 --> 13:16.227
Winston, he doesn't know.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.965
Oh, oh, oh, no...

13:20.967 --> 13:22.634
Ah...

13:22.636 --> 13:25.003
No... I messed up just now.

13:25.005 --> 13:27.205
W-Winston.
You weren't supposed to know
that, so don't know that.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.706
<i> Is that true?</i>
<i> What's going on?</i>

13:28.708 --> 13:29.974
Hey, Schmidt.
It's Jess. I'm so sorry.

13:29.976 --> 13:31.943
<i> I picked up Cece's phone,</i>
<i> it was Sadie,</i>

13:31.945 --> 13:34.746
and she told me the news, and
now everybody knows but Cece.

13:34.748 --> 13:36.414
So I'm gonna send her home.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.349
Okay, okay, but Jess, um...

13:38.351 --> 13:40.451
Plea... (sighs)

13:40.453 --> 13:41.786
Is it true?

13:41.788 --> 13:43.454
Yeah. It's true.

13:43.456 --> 13:44.789
<i> Just get home.</i>

13:44.791 --> 13:46.524
She needs to hear it from you.

13:49.162 --> 13:51.729
Miracle of miracles!
Finally got a parking spot.

13:52.833 --> 13:54.132
Why y'all just staring at me?

13:54.134 --> 13:56.134
Just really happy
you found that spot.

13:56.136 --> 13:58.136
Man, people wait their whole
lives looking for a spot.

13:58.138 --> 13:59.838
Thank you.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.072
And here, you've
been blessed.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.575
With a spot.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.479
MERLE: Okay, so I do
have a few changes.

14:08.481 --> 14:09.747
Take or leave.

14:09.749 --> 14:12.083
What if we kill off
Jessica Night in the next book?

14:12.085 --> 14:14.118
What?

14:14.120 --> 14:15.687
I was thinking that she could be
Schmith's next victim.

14:15.689 --> 14:17.522
We could do it
in a big way,

14:17.524 --> 14:19.123
like, he drops
a piano on her head.

14:19.125 --> 14:21.492
(blows raspberry) Done-zo.
What?

14:21.494 --> 14:23.328
Maybe she takes
a baseball right to the face.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.629
Batter out!

14:24.631 --> 14:25.930
Have you ever done this before?

14:25.932 --> 14:27.298
Yes, actually.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.666
I published the entire
<i> Bitch Witch</i> series.

14:28.668 --> 14:31.135
<i> Bitch Witch Christmas,</i>
<i> Bitch Witch Prom Night,</i>

14:31.137 --> 14:33.137
and<i> Bitch Witches</i>
<i> of Rhode Island.</i>

14:33.139 --> 14:34.138
Yeah. Okay.

14:34.140 --> 14:35.840
Look, Nick, I-I get

14:35.842 --> 14:37.442
that you're afraid
to make changes.

14:39.112 --> 14:41.145
Actually, I'm not afraid.

14:42.782 --> 14:44.249
Okay, then
you'll think about it.

14:44.251 --> 14:45.750
(chuckles softly)

14:48.788 --> 14:50.321
No, I'm not gonna make
those changes

14:50.323 --> 14:52.490
because those-those ideas
are really bad.

14:52.492 --> 14:54.425
Well, I...
Jessica Night is
the whole reason

14:54.427 --> 14:57.195
Pepperwood gets out of bed
every day.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.296
NICK:
Schmidt?!

14:58.298 --> 15:00.698
You were right! Schmidt?

15:00.700 --> 15:02.367
Uh, he had to go, but he left

15:02.369 --> 15:04.602
the name and number
of his favorite Uber driver,

15:04.604 --> 15:07.105
uh, Beezus "The Man" Tequito.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.606
All right.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.108
Mr. Beezus.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.676
Mr. Schmidt
likes to party.

15:11.678 --> 15:12.977
You like to party?

15:12.979 --> 15:15.446
Wh-- Oh, very cool lights.

15:15.448 --> 15:18.149
But, no, uh, Beezus, I...
I don't like to party...

15:18.151 --> 15:19.851
It's not the first time
I've heard that.

15:19.853 --> 15:20.952
I'm gonna go see a girl.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.654
Oh, good for you.
Yeah.

15:23.490 --> 15:24.489
Want to hear some music?

15:24.491 --> 15:26.157
Sure, yeah,
that could be inspiring.

WINSTON: Last box
in the truck. Hmm.

15:56.189 --> 15:58.923
I haven't seen this room
this empty since Steve left.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.325
Who's Steve?

16:00.327 --> 16:02.093
Oh, he was the guy who lived
in this room before Jess.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.928
Real night screamer.

16:03.930 --> 16:06.664
He couldn't sleep unless he was
screaming a whole bunch. Yeah.

16:06.666 --> 16:08.800
I guess I should
give you my keys.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.535
Are you really not gonna
tell Nick how you feel?

16:12.038 --> 16:14.005
That's such a Steve move.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.640
(chuckles)
Steve was in love with Nick?

16:15.642 --> 16:17.442
Oh, yeah, and he
never told him.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.677
That... sweet,
gay coward.

16:19.679 --> 16:22.113
Maybe Steve left
this place and-and...

16:22.115 --> 16:25.483
and finally got the space
that he needed to...

16:25.485 --> 16:27.418
become a better version
of himself.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.020
Yeah, I mean, he's selling
tires in Little Rock.

16:29.022 --> 16:31.456
Okay, well, forget Steve.
Look, I know I'm being a coward.

16:31.458 --> 16:33.458
Jess, I know you.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.994
You can't walk away
without talking to him.

16:35.996 --> 16:38.696
This is how I have to
move on, and...

16:38.698 --> 16:39.864
I have to go.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.600
Let's get on the road.

16:42.602 --> 16:43.901
Okay.

16:45.305 --> 16:47.038
Wait.

16:50.643 --> 16:51.943
(sighs)

16:54.014 --> 16:55.380
(line ringing)

16:58.485 --> 17:00.118
VAN (recorded):<i> You've reached</i>
<i> Van. Leave a message.</i>

17:00.120 --> 17:01.319
<i> (beep)</i>

17:03.990 --> 17:05.423
Hello, Van.

17:05.425 --> 17:07.258
This is Winston Bishop.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.793
I'm your son.

17:08.795 --> 17:11.362
I'm calling to tell you
that I am getting married

17:11.364 --> 17:13.297
to the most amazing woman

17:13.299 --> 17:15.700
in the world.

17:15.702 --> 17:17.101
And I turned out
pretty great, too,

17:17.103 --> 17:20.605
so, um... call me
whenever you're ready.

17:20.607 --> 17:22.807
Oh, also, I have a cat.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.642
He's not ready to have
a relationship with you,

17:24.644 --> 17:27.478
so just don't try
to force it on him.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.981
(phone beeps)

17:29.983 --> 17:32.250
Yeah, so...

17:32.252 --> 17:33.951
now it's your turn.

17:33.953 --> 17:35.420
Be brave.

17:35.422 --> 17:37.321
I can't.

17:37.323 --> 17:38.689
I'm sorry.

17:43.997 --> 17:45.963
Hey, babe, I'm back.

17:45.965 --> 17:47.331
Whew!

17:47.333 --> 17:49.167
(sighs)

17:49.169 --> 17:50.268
What's, uh...

17:52.305 --> 17:53.337
What's happening?

17:53.339 --> 17:55.940
I'm pregnant.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.342
What?
I mean, you're pregnant.

17:58.344 --> 17:59.744
We're pregnant. (chuckles)

17:59.746 --> 18:01.612
Sadie called you,

18:01.614 --> 18:04.115
and Jess picked up,

18:04.117 --> 18:06.250
then she called again
and Winston picked up,

18:06.252 --> 18:07.585
Winston told me.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.454
It's an upsetting
scene, but, um,

18:09.456 --> 18:11.522
we're having a baby, Cece.

18:11.524 --> 18:13.357
I wanted to
buy you flowers,

18:13.359 --> 18:16.661
but I couldn't pick out
which ones, so...

18:16.663 --> 18:18.830
We're having a baby?

18:18.832 --> 18:21.666
We're having a baby.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.201
(whispers):
We're having a baby.

18:25.605 --> 18:28.039
I really didn't think
it was gonna happen for us.

18:28.041 --> 18:29.340
It's a caramel miracle.

18:29.342 --> 18:31.209
(both laugh)

18:38.852 --> 18:41.085
BEEZUS: Don't forget
to give me five stars!

18:41.087 --> 18:42.487
NICK: Three and a half!
Thanks, Beezus!

18:42.489 --> 18:44.322
Hey, let's turn
on some music.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.023

18:46.025 --> 18:49.327
