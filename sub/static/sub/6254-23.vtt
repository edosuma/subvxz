The CDC. sent over
preliminary photos from the body find.

They were inspecting a facility in Maryland
that disposes of biohazard waste.

And the remains were found
with veterinary waste?
Yeah.

with a skull that damaged.

00:42.126 --> 00:44.117

Yes.

[ Brennan ]
But the decomposition was too rapid,

00:50.009 --> 00:52.000
and it wouldn’t have damaged
the bone so severely.

00:52.094 --> 00:55.382
Damage that advanced from fasciitis would
normally take at least three to four days.

00:55.473 --> 00:57.885
Dr. Jacobs from the C.D.C.

So we could be looking
at some kind of outbreak situation here?

01:06.192 --> 01:08.148
We have to assume so, yes.
