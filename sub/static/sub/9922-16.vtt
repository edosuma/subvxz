WEBVTT

01:14.367 --> 01:15.994
What if it's true?

01:17.078 --> 01:18.163
What?

01:18.830 --> 01:20.457
What if Ragnar is dead?

01:23.585 --> 01:25.211
Ragnar can't be dead.

01:25.587 --> 01:28.214
But Ivar said...
Ivar didn't see Ragnar die!

01:28.381 --> 01:29.591
He wasn't there!

01:41.227 --> 01:44.147
Oh, my Ragnar, my love.

01:46.566 --> 01:48.026
I am sorry.

01:48.693 --> 01:50.445
Forgive me,

01:50.528 --> 01:55.116
but if he is dead,
what will you do?

01:57.160 --> 01:59.996
I must pick up the burden.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.206
The burden?

02:03.374 --> 02:04.542
Of ruling.

02:05.418 --> 02:07.128
Ragnar hated it.

02:07.212 --> 02:08.838
It weighed him down.

02:10.298 --> 02:12.217
Perhaps it even killed him.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.930
Then why do it
to yourself?

02:22.560 --> 02:27.398
I think Ragnar
is looking at me,
and I can't disappoint him.

02:28.066 --> 02:31.152
Nor can I disappoint myself.

02:31.236 --> 02:33.947
Or you, or Torvi,

02:34.030 --> 02:38.284
or any of the shield-maidens
who have died
fighting at my side.

02:38.576 --> 02:43.915
If I walked away now,
what would they say
about me in Valhalla?

03:00.598 --> 03:02.142
We have to prepare.

03:04.435 --> 03:05.812
For what?

03:05.895 --> 03:07.105
The sons of Ragnar.

03:07.188 --> 03:09.774
The sons of Ragnar will come
to claim vengeance.

03:11.067 --> 03:12.485
Not upon me.

03:13.611 --> 03:15.071
Only upon Aelle.

03:15.155 --> 03:16.614
That was our agreement.

03:16.698 --> 03:18.366
Your agreement?

03:18.449 --> 03:20.118
With a pagan?
Yes.

03:21.119 --> 03:24.122
Ragnar and I were
alike in many ways.

03:24.205 --> 03:27.750
I trusted him.
He trusted me.

03:27.834 --> 03:32.297
I'm not talking about Ragnar.
I'm talking about his son.
Ivar?

03:33.464 --> 03:34.549
Hmm. He's a cripple.

03:34.632 --> 03:35.675
He's a Viking.

03:36.467 --> 03:38.386
You made a huge
mistake releasing him.

03:38.803 --> 03:40.305
Don't say that.
It's true.

03:41.306 --> 03:43.641
I mean,
don't contradict your father.

03:47.979 --> 03:52.108
I care about your father,
and I believe in him.

03:52.275 --> 03:54.485
Yes, I know you do,

03:54.569 --> 04:00.366
and I can never
totally express
my gratitude to you,

04:03.620 --> 04:06.247
but Aethelwulf is right.

04:06.331 --> 04:09.542
The sons of Ragnar
will doubtless return
to these shores.

04:10.418 --> 04:15.924
And there is no better man
than you, my son,

04:16.007 --> 04:20.303
to raise an army and make
every preparation
for our defense.

04:26.351 --> 04:27.769
And...

04:30.605 --> 04:32.398
And what will you do, Father?

04:33.024 --> 04:34.025
Oh...

04:34.901 --> 04:37.028
I'll continue my
lessons with Alfred.

04:38.488 --> 04:42.325
The boy's very responsible.
He's coming along nicely.

04:59.384 --> 05:00.843
What are we going to do?

05:00.927 --> 05:02.345
If Father is dead...

05:02.428 --> 05:03.805
Mother and Father.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.139
I said, "If."

05:06.432 --> 05:08.101
It is possible
that Lagertha might

05:08.184 --> 05:10.186
change her mind
about keeping us alive.

05:10.353 --> 05:11.771
Of course she might.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.147
How can we trust her?

05:13.231 --> 05:14.649
We can't.

05:14.732 --> 05:19.320
But if we try and kill her,
all furies will be released.

05:19.404 --> 05:21.281
And who would support us?

05:23.408 --> 05:25.952
Mother and Father.

05:26.035 --> 05:27.287
I can't believe it.

05:28.162 --> 05:32.583
Even if it is
true about Father,
we must bide our time.

05:34.252 --> 05:37.463
We would be fools
to give ourselves
away so quickly.

05:41.384 --> 05:42.802
So, what about Ivar?

05:44.846 --> 05:46.347
How do we control him?

05:53.604 --> 05:54.939
You tell me, brother.

06:15.043 --> 06:16.461
Mother,

06:18.046 --> 06:19.547
Father.

06:21.966 --> 06:23.301
Father...

07:04.509 --> 07:05.593
Welcome back!

07:05.676 --> 07:07.095
Lagertha!

07:30.910 --> 07:33.704
Today marks a new
dawn for Kattegat.

07:33.788 --> 07:35.248
For all of us.

07:36.416 --> 07:39.168
We do not know
King Ragnar's fate,

07:39.252 --> 07:41.921
or whether he
will ever return.

07:44.549 --> 07:48.469
You have not
been ruled properly
for a long time,

07:48.553 --> 07:50.763
and many things
have been neglected.

07:51.389 --> 07:53.933
Kattegat has changed so much
in the last few years.

07:54.016 --> 07:56.018
It has grown and flourished.

07:56.102 --> 07:58.396
By all account,
it is now the largest,

07:58.479 --> 08:00.648
richest trading
center in Norway.

08:01.983 --> 08:04.152
Which means that others

08:04.235 --> 08:06.362
are bound to be
envious of our success.

08:10.324 --> 08:12.201
And they must
look at us and wonder

08:12.285 --> 08:15.079
why we make so little effort
to protect ourselves.

08:16.122 --> 08:20.501
It is my belief
that we should begin
to build fortifications,

08:20.585 --> 08:23.421
ditches and palisades
around this site.

08:24.297 --> 08:29.343
And it is my hope,
as your Queen,
that everyone,

08:29.427 --> 08:32.346
men, women and children,

08:32.430 --> 08:34.765
the fit and the wounded,

08:34.849 --> 08:37.435
will contribute
to this great work.

08:39.103 --> 08:43.024
And those who share
my belief, say "aye."

08:43.107 --> 08:44.942
Aye!

09:19.227 --> 09:21.062
Welcome, Ivar.

09:21.479 --> 09:23.648
I've come here for justice.

09:24.232 --> 09:29.070
Everyone knows that
you killed my mother
for no reason except ambition.

09:30.738 --> 09:33.699
Therefore, I demand justice.

09:33.824 --> 09:36.285
Ivar...
Don't touch me,
coward.

09:41.499 --> 09:43.167
He is not a coward.

09:45.336 --> 09:49.090
But perhaps he understands
some things that you don't.

09:50.132 --> 09:53.219
I understand
everything perfectly.

09:55.763 --> 10:01.936
You murdered my mother
in cold blood.

10:05.648 --> 10:07.483
I want revenge.

10:08.442 --> 10:11.070
I challenge you
to single combat.

10:19.745 --> 10:21.163
I refuse.

10:21.956 --> 10:24.333
You can't refuse.

10:26.210 --> 10:32.174
I refuse to fight you,
Ivar Lothbrok,
son of Ragnar.

10:36.220 --> 10:37.430
Why?

10:38.139 --> 10:39.140
Hmm?

10:41.934 --> 10:43.728
I don't want to kill you.

10:50.401 --> 10:52.653
Who says you would kill me?

10:53.070 --> 10:54.697
I do.

10:55.990 --> 10:57.783
All right.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.995
Don't fight me, then.

11:03.748 --> 11:05.541
I don't care.
Just as long as you know

11:05.625 --> 11:09.670
that one day,
I will kill you, Lagertha.

11:13.257 --> 11:15.426
Your fate is fixed.

11:56.008 --> 11:58.636
Where are we,
do you suppose?

11:59.595 --> 12:00.721
Ispania.

12:02.181 --> 12:03.474
About here.

12:07.645 --> 12:08.979
If we're lucky.

12:11.065 --> 12:13.150
Or if the gods will it.

12:14.151 --> 12:17.738
Or have you forgotten
about the gods, Rollo?

12:23.411 --> 12:25.454
Do you think
we're lost, Floki?

12:26.539 --> 12:28.082
Oh, we are lost.

12:29.792 --> 12:31.210
And so am I.

12:32.461 --> 12:33.754
What do you mean?

12:33.838 --> 12:35.589
I no longer know who I am.

12:38.134 --> 12:41.262
Why I am here,
what my purpose is.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.473
You build boats.
It's not enough.

12:46.517 --> 12:48.227
I feel like an empty vessel.

12:49.854 --> 12:51.355
I am hollow.

12:52.982 --> 12:55.234
I need
something to fill me up.

12:58.446 --> 13:01.741
I was so sick,
I thought I was
going to die.

13:03.242 --> 13:05.369
But I had time to
think about everything.

13:06.120 --> 13:08.164
About what I want
from this life.

13:10.374 --> 13:11.500
And I want a baby.

13:14.545 --> 13:16.589
No, Helga.
Yes.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.924
I need something
more from this life.

13:19.008 --> 13:20.217
But not a child.

13:20.801 --> 13:21.969
Don't you remember?

13:22.052 --> 13:23.179
Of course I remember.

13:24.054 --> 13:25.598
How would I not remember?

13:25.681 --> 13:27.892
There won't be a "this time."

13:29.018 --> 13:30.728
I have set my face against it.

13:31.228 --> 13:33.439
I do not want another child.

13:40.196 --> 13:42.239
What are you
thinking about?

13:42.573 --> 13:48.996
I was just wondering
if Bjorn Ironside is cursed,
like his father.

13:50.623 --> 13:55.628
If we founder,
then the gods are
surely displeased.

13:57.922 --> 14:00.132
Then what shall we do?

14:01.759 --> 14:04.929
We should
not trust in his star,
but in our own.

14:06.931 --> 14:09.642
One day, we must
overcome the Lothbroks,

14:11.227 --> 14:15.272
for how else can I become
the King of all Norway?

14:19.360 --> 14:23.364
And sometimes I think,
"Why wait?"

14:23.447 --> 14:28.452
The gods will give us a sign.
They love us.

14:45.135 --> 14:46.971
Will they try to
kill you again?

14:49.348 --> 14:50.641
Possibly.

14:53.853 --> 14:55.062
I will stop them.

14:58.148 --> 14:59.817
I will protect you.

15:11.787 --> 15:12.872
Thank you.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.960
But if they're
going to kill me,

15:18.043 --> 15:20.254
you won't be
able to stop them.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.300
No one will be
able to stop them.

15:35.352 --> 15:38.188
I lay in this
same bed with Ragnar.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.028
Everything comes back to me.

15:48.032 --> 15:49.366
I am home again.

16:07.676 --> 16:09.428
We're almost out
of fresh water.

16:10.512 --> 16:11.680
I know.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.392
We need to
find a port.

16:16.393 --> 16:20.439
Not only fresh
water but provisions.
We don't have much food.

16:21.774 --> 16:24.276
What will they think?
The people there?

16:24.652 --> 16:25.903
I don't know.

16:28.489 --> 16:30.199
I don't know
anything about them.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.911
They call them Musselmen.

16:35.621 --> 16:38.540
And they worship
a god named Allah.

17:12.533 --> 17:13.784
Margrethe.

17:18.288 --> 17:19.540
I haven't seen you in a while.

17:20.708 --> 17:23.377
No, I only just
came back from Hedeby.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.757
What is wrong?

17:28.966 --> 17:30.759
Where is Ivar?

17:30.843 --> 17:32.219
Don't worry about Ivar.

17:32.469 --> 17:33.971
He has other
things on his mind.

17:36.223 --> 17:38.183
I've missed you.

17:40.144 --> 17:43.397
I didn't know if
you would forgive me.

17:43.480 --> 17:45.065
For tricking you.
And then...

17:45.149 --> 17:46.608
You're a slave.

17:46.692 --> 17:48.485
I don't blame you.

17:49.111 --> 17:52.031
And I have greater
betrayals to deal with.

17:53.991 --> 17:55.117
I have to work.

17:57.202 --> 17:58.662
And I have to see you.

18:02.541 --> 18:03.834
Can I see you?

24:58.707 --> 25:01.835
Floki, what are you doing?

25:17.726 --> 25:18.894
Who is it?

25:30.197 --> 25:31.615
Who are you?

26:04.397 --> 26:05.941
Ragnar.

26:08.318 --> 26:10.820
I knew you
would come, my love.

26:13.323 --> 26:16.868
Enjoy Valhalla.
You deserve it.

26:19.496 --> 26:21.623
But don't forget me.

26:22.916 --> 26:24.584
Haunt me.

26:26.628 --> 26:28.129
Don't leave me.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.269
Ragnar?

26:57.867 --> 26:59.411
Helga.

28:43.056 --> 28:44.682
What kind of place is this?

28:46.893 --> 28:48.144
It's a temple.

28:51.022 --> 28:52.107
Where are their gods?

28:53.316 --> 28:54.484
I can't see any.

28:55.401 --> 28:57.529
And yet they're praying
with such passion.

28:59.447 --> 29:00.990
I hate that noise!

29:05.537 --> 29:08.915
No! Stop! Stop! No.

29:10.959 --> 29:12.293
No more killing!

29:12.836 --> 29:13.837
Not in here!

29:14.754 --> 29:16.214
Not in this place!

29:16.297 --> 29:17.674
I forbid it.

29:19.342 --> 29:23.471
If you want to
kill these people,
you have to kill me first.

29:37.694 --> 29:39.529
You heard
what Floki said.

29:40.864 --> 29:42.866
We're not going to
kill these people.

29:44.993 --> 29:47.495
Leave, leave.

30:33.416 --> 30:34.417
Psst!

30:38.338 --> 30:39.339
Hvitserk.

31:32.976 --> 31:34.185
Bjorn.

31:43.695 --> 31:44.946
Wait.

31:45.613 --> 31:47.031
He is already dead.

31:54.038 --> 31:55.999
He killed himself.

32:13.266 --> 32:14.851
What do you think
he was guarding?

33:13.743 --> 33:17.663
Don't be afraid.
Please don't be afraid.

33:18.915 --> 33:20.500
I won't hurt you.

33:22.627 --> 33:25.546
You're safe. Don't be afraid.

33:28.591 --> 33:30.093
It's all right.

33:35.807 --> 33:36.849
Shh.

33:37.475 --> 33:38.768
You're safe. Shh.

33:55.785 --> 33:57.620
Come on! Come here!

33:57.954 --> 34:00.957
Take everything!
Take everything!
Let's go!

34:01.124 --> 34:02.458
Come here!

34:03.626 --> 34:05.336
Follow her...

34:05.420 --> 34:07.046
I saw it first,
it's mine!

34:09.090 --> 34:11.884
<i>My mother told me</i>

34:11.968 --> 34:14.345
<i>One day I would buy</i>

34:14.429 --> 34:16.806
<i>Galley with good oars</i>

34:16.889 --> 34:18.891
<i>Sail to distant shores...</i>

34:18.975 --> 34:20.101
Ironside, come!

34:20.184 --> 34:21.811
<i>Stand up high on the prow</i>

34:21.894 --> 34:24.605
<i>Noble barque, I steer</i>

34:24.689 --> 34:27.316
<i>Steady course for the haven</i>

34:27.400 --> 34:29.110
<i>Hew many foemen...</i>

34:41.664 --> 34:42.832
Helga!

34:43.499 --> 34:44.750
Floki! Come, come.

34:44.834 --> 34:45.960
Who is she?

34:46.043 --> 34:47.795
She is an orphan.
So?

34:47.879 --> 34:51.174
Don't you see?
She is the same
age as Angrboda.

34:51.841 --> 34:54.135
The same age that
she would have been.

34:54.302 --> 34:56.095
What do you want to
do with her, Helga?

34:56.262 --> 34:57.555
I want to take her with us.

34:57.805 --> 34:59.432
No, Helga.
Yes.

34:59.557 --> 35:00.933
No.
Yes, Floki...

35:01.017 --> 35:02.977
No, no.
Floki... She is coming.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.229
No, she's not.
She's staying, Helga.

35:05.313 --> 35:06.939
I am taking her with me!

35:28.336 --> 35:30.671
All hail Queen Lagertha.

35:31.881 --> 35:34.550
Queen of Kattegat.

35:35.551 --> 35:37.762
I saw Ragnar.

35:37.845 --> 35:41.724
Yes, I also saw him,
but so briefly.

35:43.392 --> 35:46.062
On his way to Valhalla.

35:48.064 --> 35:50.566
He was so happy.

36:08.417 --> 36:10.253
I have only
one question.

36:11.963 --> 36:14.340
Will the sons of
Ragnar kill me?

36:22.765 --> 36:24.100
Did you not hear me?

36:26.269 --> 36:28.271
Yes, I heard you.

36:28.980 --> 36:32.733
Then what is the answer,
O wise one?

36:35.111 --> 36:39.365
Will I be killed
by a son of Ragnar?

36:42.118 --> 36:44.245
Yes.

37:51.187 --> 37:53.105
We made it, Ironside.

37:55.733 --> 37:59.028
At last. The Mediterranean.

38:01.614 --> 38:05.159
This is
further than our people
have ever come.

38:05.242 --> 38:08.204
Further than Ragnar dreamed.

38:14.251 --> 38:15.669
It's beautiful.

38:44.573 --> 38:47.326
<i>How the little
piggies will grunt,</i>

38:47.410 --> 38:50.079
<i>when they hear how
the old boar suffered.</i>

38:52.373 --> 38:54.291
Hvitserk,
did you hear him, too?

38:55.042 --> 38:56.168
Yes.

39:47.803 --> 39:49.013
Ivar.

39:54.810 --> 39:56.812
Your father is dead.

39:58.105 --> 39:59.732
Killed by serpents.

40:10.951 --> 40:12.161
Cold.

40:12.244 --> 40:15.623
In the cold,
iron earth, Ragnar lies.

41:26.569 --> 41:28.237
My father is dead.

41:41.750 --> 41:46.922
<i>It gladdens me to know that
Odin prepares for a feast.</i>

41:47.006 --> 41:51.594
<i>Soon I shall be drinking ale
from curved horns!</i>

41:52.136 --> 41:56.849
<i>I shall not enter
Odin's hall with fear.</i>

41:56.932 --> 41:59.685
<i>I shall wait for
my sons to join me.</i>

41:59.768 --> 42:02.187
<i>And when they do,</i>

42:02.271 --> 42:06.150
<i>I will bask in
their tales of triumph.</i>

42:08.736 --> 42:10.821
<i>The Aesir will welcome me!</i>

42:12.156 --> 42:14.950
<i>My death comes
without apology!</i>

42:15.951 --> 42:21.123
<i>And I welcome the valkyries
to summon me home!</i>
