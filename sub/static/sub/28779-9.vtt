WEBVTT

00:03.481 --> 00:05.353
ANNOUNCER:
Zach Galifianakis is...

00:06.789 --> 00:08.269
Baskets.

00:08.312 --> 00:10.967
All new,
Thursdays at 10:00 on FX.

00:13.796 --> 00:16.059
ANNOUNCER: FX presentsPose.

00:45.306 --> 00:47.308
Four o'clock?

00:51.964 --> 00:54.967
Hello? Yeah, this is Blanca.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.501
INVESTIGATOR:
Ma'am.

01:06.544 --> 01:10.113
-Hello, ma'am?
-Sorry.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.333
You said there was acetone
and isopropyl alcohol

01:12.376 --> 01:13.769
on the premises.

01:13.812 --> 01:17.164
You are aware that thosesubstance are highly flammable?

01:17.207 --> 01:19.688
The kind of stuff
that could blow a place up.

01:19.731 --> 01:23.257
Yeah, of course.
But this was a nail salon.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.781
Those kinds of chemicals
are needed for my business.

01:25.824 --> 01:28.697
I'm not a careless person,
and I don't smoke,

01:28.740 --> 01:31.178
so ain't no lighter flames
or cigarettes in here.

01:31.221 --> 01:33.615
When was the last time
you ever heard of a nail salon

01:33.658 --> 01:35.399
blowing up out of nowhere?

01:35.443 --> 01:37.836
Excuse me.

01:41.405 --> 01:43.146
FREDERICA:
What happened to my building?

01:43.190 --> 01:46.193
This is devastating.
How will I recover?

01:46.236 --> 01:47.629
What are you doing here?

01:47.672 --> 01:51.198
My name is on the deed,
sweetheart.

01:51.241 --> 01:54.592
I was in the car heading
to my summer cottage

01:54.636 --> 01:57.204
when I got the call that
my property had burned down.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.162
-Isn't that terrible?
-Yeah.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.382
I put all of my savings
into this salon, and somehow,

02:01.425 --> 02:04.341
I didn't know that insurancewas needed to cover the supplies

02:04.385 --> 02:07.257
and furniture
and all of my stuff!

02:09.390 --> 02:12.219
It went up into smoke
just like that.

02:16.223 --> 02:18.355
You live and you learn.

02:18.399 --> 02:20.749
Going toe-to-toe with you,

02:20.792 --> 02:23.534
I learned what protecting
yourself really looks like.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.580
You taught me that.

02:25.623 --> 02:27.843
And for that,
I will be grateful.

02:27.886 --> 02:30.062
After our squabble,

02:30.106 --> 02:32.195
I raised the insurance coverageon this building.

02:32.239 --> 02:35.242
I just had a feeling something
like this could happen.

02:35.285 --> 02:38.984
Come next spring, I'll triple
the rent, attracting tenants

02:39.028 --> 02:40.551
that will breathe
a breath of fresh air

02:40.595 --> 02:43.337
-into this ghetto enclave.
-Yeah, this place

02:43.380 --> 02:46.253
is right on track
for a much-needed makeover.

02:46.296 --> 02:49.256
How I will
miss our conversations.

02:49.299 --> 02:52.476
I will relish all summer
the thought of you back home,

02:52.520 --> 02:55.784
in your grim little
Bronx walk-up, filing acrylics

02:55.827 --> 03:00.180
in the sweltering
100-degree August heat.

03:11.321 --> 03:13.671
PRAY TELL:
The category is...

03:13.715 --> 03:17.371
Live...

03:17.414 --> 03:19.373
Work...

03:19.416 --> 03:23.246
Pose!

03:52.101 --> 03:53.537
Leaving already?

03:53.581 --> 03:56.366
My usual 3:00 is gone
for the summer.

03:56.410 --> 03:57.367
The whole summer?

03:57.411 --> 03:58.760
This business is seasonal.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.196
Didn't you know?

04:00.240 --> 04:01.850
It's not like the piers.

04:01.893 --> 04:04.853
Most of the clientele here
take their vacation in August.

04:04.896 --> 04:07.203
The whole town clears out.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.945
Shouldn't you be checkin'
on that dude in your room?

04:09.988 --> 04:11.512
Oh, shit!

04:11.555 --> 04:13.427
I almost forgot.

04:14.689 --> 04:16.691
Has it been three hours already?

04:16.734 --> 04:18.214
Three and a half.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.434
Do you need a spanking
or a beating of some kind?

04:20.477 --> 04:21.652
No.

04:21.696 --> 04:24.089
Just leave me
a little while longer, please?

04:24.133 --> 04:26.222
I have other business
to attend to.

04:26.266 --> 04:27.571
I'm a woman of the world.

04:27.615 --> 04:29.965
I don't want
to stay here all day long.

04:30.008 --> 04:31.009
Then leave.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.010
I don't care.

04:32.054 --> 04:33.447
Come back in the morning.

04:33.490 --> 04:35.362
I just like being left
in isolation.

04:35.405 --> 04:37.668
No sight, no sound,

04:37.712 --> 04:41.585
feeling nothing but the pain
of being in one position

04:41.629 --> 04:45.459
and the warm sweat
under the latex.

04:45.502 --> 04:49.332
May I ask what exactly is
the point of this?

04:49.376 --> 04:53.684
Why pay to be left alone whenyou can be left alone for free?

04:53.728 --> 04:56.034
I'm not paying to be left alone.

04:56.078 --> 04:59.386
I'm paying to feel
the pain of anticipation.

04:59.429 --> 05:01.344
I'm not leaving you here
all night.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.041
I don't have good experiences

05:03.085 --> 05:05.479
with leaving people
to their own devices.

05:05.522 --> 05:06.697
Okay.

05:06.741 --> 05:08.960
Can I come back tomorrow,
though?

05:09.004 --> 05:11.441
I thought you were a bigwig
on Wall Street.

05:11.485 --> 05:13.617
Aren't you leaving town
like the rest of them?

05:13.661 --> 05:15.227
I got a great place
at the beach,

05:15.271 --> 05:17.186
but I almost never go.

05:17.229 --> 05:19.493
I like it better here,
where it's...

05:19.536 --> 05:21.277
really hot.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.453
Beach house, you say?

05:29.764 --> 05:33.811
♪ Oh...♪

05:33.855 --> 05:35.770
Oh, my gosh, it's so hot.

05:35.813 --> 05:37.380
LULU: Hey, I know.
Is the window open?

05:37.424 --> 05:39.208
A popsicle in this heat

05:39.251 --> 05:41.253
is like throwing
a snowball in hell.

05:41.297 --> 05:42.429
Do you ever stop complaining?

05:42.472 --> 05:44.387
-No.
-Well, then, now's
a good time to learn.

05:44.431 --> 05:45.475
Here, girl.

05:49.784 --> 05:51.394
Girl, I can't believe
the salon is gone.

05:51.438 --> 05:54.179
Come on, tell 'em what happened.

05:54.223 --> 05:57.313
I can't prove anything, but...

05:57.357 --> 05:59.228
I think she set the place
afire herself.

05:59.271 --> 06:01.448
-For the insurance.
-Arson?

06:01.491 --> 06:04.059
I'd do the same if I owned
that shithole.

06:04.102 --> 06:05.321
-Elektra!
-Sorry, daughter.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.236
I'm crazy from this heat.

06:07.279 --> 06:11.458
-That's okay, I appreciate y'allcoming over to support.
-I hope so.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.198
I feel like I'm being fucked
by Satan himself

06:13.242 --> 06:14.417
in the seventh circle.

06:14.461 --> 06:17.028
Are the authorities
investigating?

06:17.072 --> 06:18.682
I ain't got no power.

06:18.726 --> 06:20.205
ELEKTRA:
This isn't the first time
any of us have met

06:20.249 --> 06:21.642
with adversities.

06:21.685 --> 06:23.426
This tenement in August,
for instance.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.646
ANGEL:
Oh, my gosh.
You can't give up, Ma.

06:25.689 --> 06:28.562
I never thought my modeling
career would be what it is,

06:28.605 --> 06:30.128
but you encouraged me.

06:30.172 --> 06:32.435
If I could do it,
you most definitely can.

06:32.479 --> 06:33.871
No, it's not about that.

06:33.915 --> 06:36.439
I spent my life savings
on that salon.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.920
So, Ma, just save again and getanother one. You be a'ight.

06:38.963 --> 06:40.617
Will you stop saying
it's all right?!

06:40.661 --> 06:43.359
My opportunity came and went.

06:43.403 --> 06:47.450
Everything I live for, my kids,my salon, it's gone.

06:47.494 --> 06:48.799
It's all right, girl.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.845
I think she's having
a heat stroke.

06:50.888 --> 06:54.326
-Bitch, would you stopcomplaining about the damn heat?-ANGEL: Shut up!

06:54.370 --> 06:55.458
We are all hot.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.894
I am in purgatory.

06:56.938 --> 06:59.506
It feels like someone turnedthis thermostat up to "inferno."

06:59.549 --> 07:02.160
-Well, you're the one
with the air-conditioning.
-Right.

07:02.204 --> 07:03.597
-Why-- How come we're not
in your crib?
-Yeah. Shit.

07:03.640 --> 07:05.512
Because even with a window
air-conditioning unit,

07:05.555 --> 07:07.601
it's beginning to smell.

07:07.644 --> 07:09.385
Smell? Why?

07:12.562 --> 07:15.522
ELEKTRA:
This old lady from
the Caribbean has a fish fry,

07:15.565 --> 07:17.611
and it wafts through
the hallways.

07:17.654 --> 07:21.528
The stench intensifies when the thermostat hits 85 degrees.

07:26.446 --> 07:30.493
Well, what we need to do is
take a trip down to the beach.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.755
The water will cool us off.

07:31.799 --> 07:33.627
Well, good, 'cause I need
a vacation.

07:33.670 --> 07:36.151
That's a good idea.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.153
Let's do a girls' trip.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.415
ANGEL:
For real? A girls' trip?

07:39.459 --> 07:41.722
Yes. Look at the year we've had.

07:41.765 --> 07:42.984
We've lost Candy,

07:43.027 --> 07:45.987
and Blanca ruined her house
and lost her business and...

07:46.030 --> 07:48.642
-Okay, where are we going?
-I have just the place.

07:48.685 --> 07:50.339
Ladies, pack your swimsuits

07:50.382 --> 07:53.211
and meet at my house
tomorrow morning.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.872
You're not scared people gonna
try us if we walk down

08:01.916 --> 08:04.222
a New York street
in swimsuits and heels?

08:04.266 --> 08:06.703
I have a Hertz rental car
waiting for us outside.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.575
O.J. himself would approve.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.186
Work.

08:11.229 --> 08:12.927
What's that smell?

08:12.970 --> 08:14.581
Pine.

08:14.624 --> 08:17.627
I'm a woman who likes
her scented candles.

08:17.671 --> 08:19.237
Excited?

08:19.281 --> 08:21.762
Yeah, I've never been
on a road trip before.

08:21.805 --> 08:24.765
I feel like we about to go in aChevy Chase movie or something.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.898
Darling, if you'regoing to be a successful model,

08:27.942 --> 08:30.553
you have to learn how to travel,
and how to travel well.

08:30.597 --> 08:33.643
Rule number one is
to always look your best.

08:33.687 --> 08:35.427
What you tryin' to say?

08:36.864 --> 08:38.430
Uh-huh.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.609
Perfection.

08:42.652 --> 08:44.349
I simply cannot stand it
when a woman boards a plane

08:44.393 --> 08:45.742
without a full face of makeup.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.352
Oh, I feel you.

08:47.396 --> 08:50.268
Lulu! What's taking
so goddamn long?!

08:50.312 --> 08:52.227
Come out already!

08:54.621 --> 08:56.710
You guys.

08:56.753 --> 08:58.973
Oh, dear God.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.583
What the hell is wrong with her?

09:00.627 --> 09:03.412
I feel so... fat.

09:03.455 --> 09:05.283
Hey, stop it.
You look damn tasty.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.372
Not slumped over like that,
she doesn't.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.810
-Stand up straight.

09:09.853 --> 09:12.769
It's one thing to be on the polein a dark club,

09:12.813 --> 09:15.816
it's another thing to let it allhang out under the naked sun.

09:15.859 --> 09:17.861
I mean, what if I get clocked
or something?

09:17.905 --> 09:19.210
Girl, please stop it.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.298
The only thing
that they clocking is

09:20.342 --> 09:21.691
you being a beautiful woman.

09:21.735 --> 09:24.085
Give me some of that
Lulu attitude.

09:24.128 --> 09:26.087
You're right, I do look
pretty tasty.

09:26.130 --> 09:28.611
There we go.

09:28.655 --> 09:30.787
Wait a minute.
Wh-What is that smell?

09:30.831 --> 09:32.093
Pine.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.530
-Scented candles.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.705
That's Blanca.

09:35.749 --> 09:37.489
ANGEL:
Mother.

09:42.233 --> 09:45.628
Somebody please
fetch me my nerve pills.

09:45.672 --> 09:47.674
Well, hello to you, too.

09:47.717 --> 09:50.546
Where's your swimsuit?

09:50.590 --> 09:52.417
I will not be seen in public

09:52.461 --> 09:54.419
with you looking like Elly May
fresh off the farm.

09:54.463 --> 09:56.247
This is all that I got.

09:56.291 --> 09:59.120
Of course it is. I suppose I canlet you borrow something

09:59.163 --> 10:00.643
from my guest closet.

10:00.687 --> 10:02.776
No, I'm comfortable in this.

10:02.819 --> 10:05.082
No, it's really no problem.

10:05.126 --> 10:06.693
Just don't stain it with
whatever awful food

10:06.736 --> 10:08.346
-you're eating these days.
-Elektra, I said no.

10:11.088 --> 10:13.351
If this is about your salon,

10:13.395 --> 10:15.527
I will not allow
your rotten mood

10:15.571 --> 10:17.094
to ruin this trip for everyone.

10:17.138 --> 10:19.662
It's not about the salon.
I'm just not like you girls.

10:19.706 --> 10:21.098
There are certain things
that you can wear

10:21.142 --> 10:22.360
that I cannot.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.798
If this is about tucking,
I got some extra duct tape.

10:24.841 --> 10:26.930
It's not about that, either.

10:26.974 --> 10:29.933
I just don't like being exposed.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.369
I don't like the summer.

10:31.413 --> 10:34.459
Men whispering on the streets,
calling me a man,

10:34.503 --> 10:36.592
a freak, a tranny.

10:38.376 --> 10:39.726
ANGEL:
Ma,

10:39.769 --> 10:41.815
people always
gonna have opinions.

10:41.858 --> 10:44.556
Don't matter how beautiful
or busted you are.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.689
That's just part of being
a woman in a man's world.

10:47.864 --> 10:50.737
So what we need to do

10:50.780 --> 10:52.695
is replace
those negative voices

10:52.739 --> 10:55.045
with some words
of encouragement.

10:55.089 --> 10:57.091
Come on, y'all.
I'm gonna treat Mother Blanca

10:57.134 --> 10:59.615
-before we hit the road.

10:59.659 --> 11:02.096
-So, get your shit together.-LULU: We're gonna go shopping.

11:02.139 --> 11:05.360
-LULU: Oh!
-Hey. Oh.

11:05.403 --> 11:07.579
Didn't I tell you if you put askirt on, it would be sickening?

11:07.623 --> 11:09.320
Yes, I guess you're right.I do look kind of sexy, don't I?

11:09.364 --> 11:10.757
-Uh, uh-huh.
-Kind of.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.759

eating each other out yet?

11:17.198 --> 11:19.330
-No.
-No.

No, no, no.
You all get your own bedrooms,

14:25.212 --> 14:26.909
though the master is mine,
obviously.

from the wine cellar.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.916
The garage is off-limits.

What's in the garage?

14:35.222 --> 14:38.355
See, I knew something was fishyabout this.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.967
Did you kidnap this man
and steal his house?

14:41.010 --> 14:43.404
What do you take me for?
He invited us.

14:43.447 --> 14:45.536
Practically begged me to come,

14:45.580 --> 14:48.235
once I planted the idea
in his head.

14:50.019 --> 14:51.803
Can he hear us?

14:51.847 --> 14:53.283
Not with the hood
and headphones on.

14:53.327 --> 14:55.155
ANGEL:
So, I don't get it.

14:55.198 --> 14:56.634
He-He's paying you
to take him down here

14:56.678 --> 14:58.767
and-and-and...
and do what exactly?

14:58.810 --> 15:01.204
Oh, I had a girl come upwith him earlier to set him up.

15:01.248 --> 15:03.511
My job is just to check on him
every few hours,

15:03.554 --> 15:05.730
-tease him a little.
-LULU: But, uh,

15:05.774 --> 15:07.776
how does he go to the bathroom
in this thing?

15:07.819 --> 15:09.212
We deprive him of food
all weekend long,

15:09.256 --> 15:11.649
-so no worries about number two.-

15:11.693 --> 15:13.651
Otherwise,
he just goes when he has to.

15:13.695 --> 15:16.306
Oh, girl. Oh, my God.
Men are so fucked up.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.221
-Okay.
-BLANCA: You know what? Angel,

15:18.265 --> 15:20.876
Lulu, y'all go get readyfor the beach. We need a moment.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.139
-Okay. Mm-hmm.
-Okay. Yeah.

15:28.057 --> 15:32.627
We are not having another
situation like the other time.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.150
Don't worry.

15:34.194 --> 15:36.196
The mask doesn't cover
his mouth.

15:36.239 --> 15:39.982
He's perfectly safe. Look.

15:40.026 --> 15:44.465
Joe, Blanca. Blanca, Joe.

15:44.508 --> 15:46.162
Nice to meet you.

15:46.206 --> 15:48.991
Mm. Feeling dehydrated, Joe?

15:49.035 --> 15:51.428
-Light-headed?
-No.

15:51.472 --> 15:53.604
I'm feeling amazing.

15:53.648 --> 15:55.606
I'm loving being out here,

15:55.650 --> 15:57.260
where it's still scorching hot
in the garage.

15:57.304 --> 15:59.262
-ELEKTRA: Mm-hmm.
-And even more isolated.

15:59.306 --> 16:00.698
Mm-hmm.

16:00.742 --> 16:02.265
And cover me up again?

16:02.309 --> 16:04.006
ELEKTRA:
How long before
we should come back?

16:04.050 --> 16:05.616
Tomorrow?

16:05.660 --> 16:08.010
We'll check back
in a couple of hours.

16:08.054 --> 16:11.840
Okay. Let's hit
the beach, darling, come on.

16:27.682 --> 16:30.293
You know, why the hell
are we cooped up

16:30.337 --> 16:32.382
on that stinking island
when we could be out here,

16:32.426 --> 16:35.037
living like movie stars?

16:35.081 --> 16:39.259
No sweaty subways,no skyscrapers to trap the heat.

16:39.302 --> 16:41.174
This is heaven.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.306
-Mm-hmm.
-Yes, sir.

16:43.350 --> 16:45.526
You know, all my life,

16:45.569 --> 16:47.528
I've lived an hour away
from here,

16:47.571 --> 16:50.096
and this is the first time
I've ever seen the ocean.

16:50.139 --> 16:52.924
You know, my late mother
used to tell me,

16:52.968 --> 16:55.101
"If you ever feel too big
for your britches,

16:55.144 --> 16:56.319
"go to the ocean
and stare at it.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.626
It'll make you feel small."

16:58.669 --> 17:01.324
-LULU: Mm-hmm.
-Now I know what
she was talking about.

17:01.368 --> 17:04.675
♪ This air of silence♪

17:04.719 --> 17:06.155
♪ In the bedroom...♪

17:06.199 --> 17:09.289
-Should we dip our toes in?
-Uh-uh.

17:09.332 --> 17:12.118
No way. I've seen Jawsway too
many times to know better.

17:12.161 --> 17:15.425
Besides, I taste too sweet
for sharks to resist.

17:15.469 --> 17:17.645
Girl, I just got my edges laid,

17:17.688 --> 17:20.213
-and I'm not going near
any water this weekend.
-Angel?

17:20.256 --> 17:24.086
All right, now,
y'all don't laugh at me,

17:24.130 --> 17:26.784
but I am terrified of water.

17:26.828 --> 17:28.525
I don't know how to swim.

17:28.569 --> 17:31.224
I mean, I always wanted tolearn, but there ain't no pools

17:31.267 --> 17:33.226
in the projects.

17:33.269 --> 17:35.663
One day my father brought me
over to the, uh,

17:35.706 --> 17:39.145
fancy country club
up north in the Bronx.

17:39.188 --> 17:40.581
He said he was gonna finally
teach me how to swim,

17:40.624 --> 17:43.105
but then when we got there,
girl,

17:43.149 --> 17:47.240
they ain't let us past
the front desk.

17:47.283 --> 17:48.980
If it's any consolation,
I'm not a good swimmer either.

17:49.024 --> 17:50.895
How 'bout we teach each other
right now?

17:50.939 --> 17:51.896
-Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah.
-BLANCA: What?

17:51.940 --> 17:53.898
-Ain't no way. Hell no.
-We'll hold hands.

17:53.942 --> 17:55.378
We won't go past our thighs.

17:55.422 --> 17:57.511
-What if I get stung
by a jellyfish?
-Shark.

17:57.554 --> 17:59.165
Oh, come on, y'all.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.732
When are we gonna ever
do this again as a family?

18:01.776 --> 18:04.257
This is our vacation. Come on,
let's live out our dreams.

18:04.300 --> 18:07.477

18:11.394 --> 18:13.266

18:13.309 --> 18:15.572
-I should've sent
that damn girl to school.

18:19.228 --> 18:22.231
I'll go in the water only
if your promise not to let go.

18:22.275 --> 18:24.277
I promise.

18:28.890 --> 18:32.023
All right.

18:32.067 --> 18:34.548
-Yo, and since
we're making promises...
-Hmm?

-Uh-huh.

any of that stuff.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.623

19:57.500 --> 19:59.589

19:59.633 --> 20:02.853

20:14.909 --> 20:16.650

20:16.693 --> 20:20.480
I was so preoccupied with givingher a distinguished send-off

20:20.523 --> 20:21.829
that I never went up
to her casket.

20:21.872 --> 20:23.396
What?

20:23.439 --> 20:26.312
I don't have any regrets,

20:26.355 --> 20:28.488
but I do regret that.

Uh, there should be some
in the wine cellar.

22:24.212 --> 22:26.170
It's empty, you idiot!

22:26.214 --> 22:29.173
Uh, I'm sorr-- I haven't been
out here a lot this summer.

22:29.217 --> 22:32.307
I guess my house person
didn't have time to...

22:32.351 --> 22:34.265
Absolutely useless.

22:36.355 --> 22:37.791
LULU:
I'm telling you, girl,

22:37.834 --> 22:39.009
he was feeling it.

22:39.053 --> 22:42.317
-He was not.
-I saw it.

22:42.361 --> 22:43.971
He was feeling it, and...

22:44.014 --> 22:46.277
-it was big.
-Oh, girl, whatever.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.410
The one time I go to the beach
and I almost die.

22:48.454 --> 22:51.326
People were looking at me.
I feel so stupid.

22:51.370 --> 22:52.632
Nah, for real, though,
I feel like he was trying

22:52.675 --> 22:53.459
-to slip a little tongue...
-Ah!

22:53.502 --> 22:55.243
-Get it, bitch.
-Ooh, I could've

22:55.286 --> 22:57.680
lied there all day
with him on top of me

22:57.724 --> 22:59.421
and let him
do whatever he wanted...

22:59.465 --> 23:02.250
-Mother!
-What? I don't care
if anybody was watching.

23:02.293 --> 23:04.687
-She's just living her life.
-ELEKTRA: Please tell me

23:04.731 --> 23:07.124
you're not still speaking
of black Hasselhoff.

23:07.168 --> 23:10.040
We must concentrate
on what really matters.

23:10.084 --> 23:12.695
Were any of you able to find usa suitable beverage?

23:12.739 --> 23:15.698
-Just warm beer and scotch.
-That just won't do.

23:15.742 --> 23:18.788
How does this man have all thismoney and nothing to drink?

23:18.832 --> 23:20.573
Girl, white people.

23:20.616 --> 23:22.313
You know what?

23:22.357 --> 23:23.924
Get dressed. We're going out.

23:23.967 --> 23:26.100
To town? Us?

23:26.143 --> 23:29.582
Fuck that.
We have nothing to hide.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.235
We're going out
and treating ourselves

23:31.279 --> 23:33.673
-to a feast and a drink.
- Why just one?

23:33.716 --> 23:35.675
And I've always wanted
to try one of those

23:35.718 --> 23:37.372
-Long Island Iced Teas.
-Yes...

23:37.416 --> 23:38.852
Well, Blanca dear, when in Rome.

23:38.895 --> 23:41.463
Ladies, to our rooms.

23:46.163 --> 23:48.165
Four, please.

23:56.173 --> 23:59.307
Could we please have
a table by the window?

23:59.350 --> 24:02.397
I'm sorry, but all of our windowtables are reserved.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.184
She lying.

24:09.404 --> 24:11.319
HOSTESS:
Can I start you off

24:11.362 --> 24:13.103
-with something to drink?
-LULU: Yes.

24:13.147 --> 24:15.149
We'll have four Long Island
Iced Teas, thank you.

24:15.192 --> 24:17.325
And can we have a shrimp
cocktail while we look

24:17.368 --> 24:19.196
-at the menu? I'm starving.
-HOSTESS: Sure thing.

24:19.240 --> 24:21.198
Your waiter
will be with you shortly.

24:21.242 --> 24:23.462
Thank you.

24:25.725 --> 24:27.988
Damn. Ew, this place
is mad bougie.

24:28.031 --> 24:30.991
I don't recognize
anything on this menu.

24:31.034 --> 24:32.645
What is a caviar blini?

24:32.688 --> 24:33.950
ELEKTRA:
It's a small pancake wafer

24:33.994 --> 24:35.561
topped with caviar.

24:35.604 --> 24:38.128
They're sinful and delightful.

24:38.172 --> 24:40.391
-Well, let's get some.
-Ooh, I want the calamari.

24:40.435 --> 24:42.176
-And some lobster, too.
-ELEKTRA: Order what
you like, children.

24:42.219 --> 24:44.178
Dinner's on me.

24:44.221 --> 24:46.006
-Oh, thank you, Mother.
-Well, I want
to get some oysters.

24:46.049 --> 24:48.008
-Y'all like oysters?
-Ew. Oysters are mad nasty...

24:51.272 --> 24:53.579
Thank you, Elektra.

24:53.622 --> 24:55.711
You don't know
how badly I needed this.

24:55.755 --> 24:58.148
We may not live
in the same house,

24:58.192 --> 25:00.934
but you'll always be
my daughter, Blanca.

25:02.239 --> 25:05.155
LULU and ANGEL:
Aww...

25:05.199 --> 25:06.679
-You're all my children.

25:06.722 --> 25:08.158
That's why you paying
for the food.

25:08.202 --> 25:09.682
-Ooh!

25:09.725 --> 25:11.422
LULU:
Oh, oh, you didn't.

25:13.686 --> 25:15.252
ELEKTRA:
I can't believe

25:15.296 --> 25:16.471
we lost him.

25:16.515 --> 25:18.560
-Lost who?
-Luther Vandross.

25:18.604 --> 25:21.215
-Girl, he gay, he ain't dead.
-ELEKTRA: He might as well be

25:21.258 --> 25:23.347
-if I can't have him.-LULU: Girl, stop being stingy.

25:23.391 --> 25:26.350
Luther's behind is a whole meal,
and all the boys

25:26.394 --> 25:28.352
-want a bite, okay?
-Ugh... I want a...

25:28.396 --> 25:31.225
Okay, I cannot keep up
with this conversation.

25:31.268 --> 25:33.836
If you will excuse me,
I got to go pee out

25:33.880 --> 25:35.969
-some of this liquor.
-Mm-hmm. Ooh!

25:36.012 --> 25:38.362
-Be careful, now. Oh, shit.
-You getting thick, girl.

25:38.406 --> 25:40.843
-She cannot handle her liquor.

25:40.887 --> 25:42.845
Hello, ladies.

25:42.889 --> 25:46.153
I'm a loyal customer here,
out with my girlfriends,

25:46.196 --> 25:49.417
and we're having just the
darndest time trying to relax

25:49.460 --> 25:51.288
into this peaceful
summer evening.

25:51.332 --> 25:53.247
And what is it
that we can do for you?

25:53.290 --> 25:57.033
There's nothing peaceful
about your grating voices,

25:57.077 --> 26:00.428
cackling so loudly we can't evenhear our own conversation.

26:00.471 --> 26:02.082
LULU:
Elektra.

26:02.125 --> 26:05.215
Do not do it. This one
right here is not worth it.

26:05.259 --> 26:08.523
I don't think that mygirlfriends and I are any louder

26:08.567 --> 26:10.046
than these other tables.

26:10.090 --> 26:12.048
Why don't you be frank with us?

26:12.092 --> 26:14.442
What exactly is it
that you're trying to say?

26:14.485 --> 26:16.270
I'm no dummy.

26:16.313 --> 26:17.967
I work in the city,

26:18.011 --> 26:21.667
and I know a man pretending
to be a woman when I see one.

26:21.710 --> 26:24.191
-And I see three
right in front of me.
-ANGEL: Oh, shit...

26:24.234 --> 26:26.454
-LULU: Bitch.
-This is not
that kind of establishment.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.892
Wait a minute, girl...

26:29.936 --> 26:33.679
God may have blessed you withBarbies, a backyard with a pony

26:33.722 --> 26:35.681
and a boyfriend named Jake
and an unwanted pregnancy

26:35.724 --> 26:37.334
that your father paid
to terminate so you could

26:37.378 --> 26:39.598
go to college and major
in being a basic bitch.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.384
None of these things
make you a woman.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.430
Mm-hmm, clear your throat.

26:46.474 --> 26:47.780
-ANGEL: Lubricate.
-Mm-hmm.

26:47.823 --> 26:49.129
LULU:
Read that bitch.

26:49.172 --> 26:52.698
Your uniform of ill-fitting
J.Crew culottes,

26:52.741 --> 26:54.656
fake pearls
and 50-cent scrunchies

26:54.700 --> 26:57.877
cannot conceal the fact that
you do not know who you are.

26:57.920 --> 27:00.227
-Mm.
-I know our presence
threatens you.

27:00.270 --> 27:02.359
We've fought for our place
at this table.

27:02.403 --> 27:05.275
And that has made us stronger
than you will ever be.

27:05.319 --> 27:06.668
Now pick your jaw
up off the floor

27:06.712 --> 27:08.365
and go back to your clam chowder

27:08.409 --> 27:10.237
and shallow conversations.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.195
My girlfriends and I
aren't going anywhere.

27:14.763 --> 27:16.939
-It was lovely talking to you.
-Y'all heard that?
-ANGEL: Yeah, go and get

27:16.983 --> 27:19.681
your clam chowder, before
the clam chowder gets you.

27:19.725 --> 27:21.944
-Shall we order another round?

27:21.988 --> 27:23.685
-Yes, please.
-Shit.

27:27.907 --> 27:29.299
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

27:30.997 --> 27:32.955
Uh...

27:32.999 --> 27:36.524
Yes, Grams.
I'm wearing sunblock.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.528
I know. Brown skin burns, too.

27:43.009 --> 27:46.534
Hey, let me call you right back.

27:46.577 --> 27:48.536
You look pretty good dry.

27:50.364 --> 27:52.888
So, you saving lives and dishingout compliments, huh?

27:52.932 --> 27:55.238
Something like that.

27:57.327 --> 27:59.416
I'm Adrian.

28:01.941 --> 28:03.507
Blanca.

28:03.551 --> 28:06.162
Pleasure.

28:06.206 --> 28:08.208
I've been manning these shores
for six summers

28:08.251 --> 28:11.385
and I've never done CPRon anyone with lips like yours.

28:11.428 --> 28:12.734
Well, I ain't ever had a man

28:12.778 --> 28:14.736
slobber over me
like that before,

28:14.780 --> 28:17.478
so I guess there's
a first time for everything.

28:20.481 --> 28:23.353
Why don't you let me take you
out for a stroll on the beach?

28:23.397 --> 28:27.314
I'd die a happy man seeing
you glow under that moonlight.

28:27.357 --> 28:29.142
Anyway, I thought you was goingto show her your signature move

28:29.185 --> 28:32.188
-and flip this damn table over.-Damn, I forgot about that.

28:32.232 --> 28:33.886
We should invite her back over
for an encore performance.

28:33.929 --> 28:36.105
No, no, no, no, no. Don't you
do it. She-she got the point.

28:36.149 --> 28:38.107
ANGEL:
Good. Girl, you just...

28:38.151 --> 28:40.457
-What happened?
-LULU: Never mind that.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.546
-Look what the cat dragged in.

28:42.590 --> 28:44.766
-Them oysters got
to you now, huh?
-LULU: No!

28:44.810 --> 28:47.813
--No. I ran into that lifeguard.

28:47.856 --> 28:48.988
ALL:
Ooh...

28:49.031 --> 28:50.598
His name is Adrian,

28:50.641 --> 28:53.209
and he wants to take me
on a stroll on the beach.

28:53.253 --> 28:55.951
-You obviously said no.
-No, I said yes.

28:55.995 --> 28:58.258
That man is fine.
Plus, it's been a cute minute

28:58.301 --> 29:01.043
-since I had a man show me
that sort of kindness.
-Take it for the team.

29:01.087 --> 29:03.350
-He was cute.
-ELEKTRA: You're insane.

29:03.393 --> 29:04.786
It's unsafe for girls like us
to walk off

29:04.830 --> 29:06.614
in the middle of the night
with a stranger.

29:06.657 --> 29:09.269
You know you can't trust a man
once the sun goes down.

29:09.312 --> 29:10.357
-That's true.-Oh, I didn't think about that.

29:10.400 --> 29:11.837
That doesn't make any sense.

29:11.880 --> 29:12.794
ANGEL:
Yes, it does.

29:12.838 --> 29:13.795
You know these men are afraid

29:13.839 --> 29:15.362
of their desires for us.

29:15.405 --> 29:17.451
They take it out on us
all the time.

29:17.494 --> 29:20.019
That's probably
what happened to Candy.

29:20.062 --> 29:21.847
They don't kill us
because they hate us.

29:21.890 --> 29:24.632
They kill us because they hate
what it means to love us.

29:24.675 --> 29:27.069
So, am I supposed to just livein fear for the rest of my life?

29:27.113 --> 29:29.855
Die without ever knowing love?

29:29.898 --> 29:31.030
Maybe you could just meet him
for coffee or something

29:31.073 --> 29:33.032
-before we head back, girl.
-Yeah.

29:33.075 --> 29:34.294
Where's the passion in that?

29:34.337 --> 29:36.600
Listen,
I know y'all care for me,

29:36.644 --> 29:38.298
but I have to trust
my instincts on this one.

29:38.341 --> 29:40.387
-I'm going.
-ELEKTRA: Wait.

29:40.430 --> 29:43.956
If you're going to go,
at least take this.

29:43.999 --> 29:45.087
ANGEL:
Oh.

29:52.660 --> 29:56.055
BLANCA:I feel like I'm in one of thoseK-tel commercials or something,

29:56.098 --> 29:59.058
selling one of those world's
greatest love song album.

29:59.101 --> 30:01.712
That's good, right?

30:01.756 --> 30:03.758
It's like a dream.

30:06.152 --> 30:10.765
So, you do this to all
your damsels in distress?

30:10.809 --> 30:12.114
No.

30:12.158 --> 30:16.423
I'm not like that.
I take this job seriously.

30:16.466 --> 30:18.860
Though I'll admit, sometimes therich white ladies will pretend

30:18.904 --> 30:23.082
to be drowning in the hopes
of fulfilling some fantasy.

30:25.911 --> 30:27.913
I go to Fordham
the rest of the year.

30:27.956 --> 30:30.219
I'm studying to be a doctor.

30:30.263 --> 30:32.308
-For real?
-Yeah.

30:32.352 --> 30:34.397
Damn, you must be smart.

30:36.312 --> 30:39.011
My mom died of stomach cancer
when I was ten.

30:40.360 --> 30:41.927
One thing I noticed,
all the orderlies

30:41.970 --> 30:44.930
were black and brown,
some of the nurses too,

30:44.973 --> 30:46.932
but every doctor was white.

30:49.108 --> 30:50.805
I'm sure they did their best,
but I think it helps

30:50.849 --> 30:52.851
to be looked after
by one of your own, you know?

30:55.984 --> 30:56.942
Do you have a dream?

30:59.205 --> 31:00.336
I had one.

31:02.164 --> 31:03.862
I'm in the beauty profession,
nails mostly.

31:06.995 --> 31:08.823
I recently opened
my very own salon,

31:08.867 --> 31:10.956
but it burnt down.

31:10.999 --> 31:13.132
That's terrible, I'm so sorry.

31:13.175 --> 31:15.134
It's all right.

31:15.177 --> 31:17.701
I'm a very optimistic person
by nature.

31:17.745 --> 31:21.009
But I've got no illusions
about the outside world

31:21.053 --> 31:22.402
having my back.

31:22.445 --> 31:24.926
Outside world?

31:24.970 --> 31:27.973
Um, you know, my community,
and the outside world,

31:28.016 --> 31:29.191
and all those things.

31:30.236 --> 31:34.109
I know, Blanca.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.763
You don't have to pretend
with me.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.375
So you've been with a girl
like me before?

31:39.419 --> 31:41.247
No.
It's not like that.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.165
You're a beautiful,

31:46.208 --> 31:48.950
funny, soulful woman.

31:48.994 --> 31:51.344
That's all that matters to me.

31:51.387 --> 31:55.217
This has got to be a dream.

31:55.261 --> 31:57.872
Can I kiss you?

31:57.916 --> 31:59.526
Didn't you already
do that earlier?

31:59.569 --> 32:00.962
A real kiss.

32:03.834 --> 32:06.011
I'm not stopping you.

33:01.762 --> 33:05.070
-Where's she at, you guys?-She should've been here by now.This is crazy.

33:05.113 --> 33:07.072
-Do you think we should
call the cops?
-Oh, my gosh, oh, my gosh.

33:10.118 --> 33:13.078
Where have you been?
We were up all night.

33:13.121 --> 33:14.253
I thought he gutted
and drowned you.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.037

of some great romantic drama.
-Hmm?

33:35.274 --> 33:36.231
-Ah, hoo.
-Keep going, Mother.

33:36.275 --> 33:37.885
-Oh...
-Tell us the details.

33:37.928 --> 33:40.627
Oh, we went on a walk
on the beach, uh...

33:40.670 --> 33:44.152
-I ain't never seen

33:44.196 --> 33:46.546
...that bright...

33:46.589 --> 33:48.548
His skin glistened in it.

33:48.591 --> 33:51.420
And girl, when I tell you
them muscles was popping...

33:51.464 --> 33:54.075
-Mm...
-LULU: Yeah, but what about
that muscle down there?

33:54.119 --> 33:56.686
-Was he packing,
'cause I know he was, girl!
-ANGEL: Ooh!

33:56.730 --> 33:58.123
-ELEKTRA: Lulu!

34:02.170 --> 34:05.130

34:05.173 --> 34:07.306
-It was romantic.
-ANGEL: Mm-hmm.

34:07.349 --> 34:10.483
Not lustful at all,and it was heartful and hopeful.

34:13.181 --> 34:16.271
-It's definitely something
I had been missing.
-Mm.

34:16.315 --> 34:18.360
And I needed that.

34:18.404 --> 34:20.232
I know that a man
is not gonna fill the void

34:20.275 --> 34:23.235
of me losing my salon, but...

34:24.714 --> 34:27.108
it was nice to be
wanted and seen.

34:27.152 --> 34:30.938
He made me believe that
good things are possible.

34:30.981 --> 34:32.244
-Mm.
-ANGEL: Oh, Ma...

34:32.287 --> 34:34.942

-Oh, I didn't have to. He knew.-ANGEL and LULU: What?!

34:41.296 --> 34:45.387

34:45.431 --> 34:47.172
-Girl, give me some.
-ANGEL: Ow, Ma.

34:47.215 --> 34:48.390
Yes.

34:48.434 --> 34:50.175
You gonna see him again?

34:51.437 --> 34:54.048
I gave him my number.

34:54.092 --> 34:55.136
But I ain't got no expectations.

34:55.180 --> 34:57.791
Listen, it was perfect
and brief.

34:57.834 --> 34:59.358
I feel that.

34:59.401 --> 35:01.969
I'm glad I'm here

It's time to go home.

35:20.292 --> 35:23.382
I assume you can peel yourself
out of this suit by yourself?

35:23.425 --> 35:29.431
Yeah. Uh, sweat and everything
makes it nice and slippery.

35:29.475 --> 35:32.869
Mistress Elektra? Thank youfor talking me into doing this.

35:32.913 --> 35:37.004
I kept fantasizing that you
drove back to the city

35:37.047 --> 35:39.137
without telling anyone
I was here.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.879
They wouldn't find me for days.

35:44.142 --> 35:45.317
Or ever, maybe.

35:47.449 --> 35:50.757
Do you realize
how luxurious your life is?

35:50.800 --> 35:54.413
Yeah. I know.
The house is great.

35:54.456 --> 35:56.241
Not the house.

35:56.284 --> 35:59.287
You have the luxury
of choosing loneliness.

35:59.331 --> 36:03.248
For some people,
it's not optional.

36:10.864 --> 36:13.214
