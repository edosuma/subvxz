02:33.507 --> 02:34.707
Hey, hey, you need to pick up the pace.

02:34.847 --> 02:36.166
- You'll buy it.
- No, no, after you.

02:36.306 --> 02:37.627
You give me first then I'll give...

02:37.747 --> 02:39.548
- Surprise!

02:42.068 --> 02:44.027
Whoa, what is all this?

02:44.067 --> 02:46.147
We can send you a celebration
before you go out?

02:46.187 --> 02:47.748
Thank you!

02:50.948 --> 02:52.827
Great job!

02:52.868 --> 02:55.268
- Congratulations, son.
- Thank you.

02:56.190 --> 02:57.389
- You have confidence?

02:57.509 --> 03:00.429
- Yeah.
- 'Cos this scholarship is a big opportunity

03:00.469 --> 03:03.347
when your mother and I
cannot afford to give you.

03:03.388 --> 03:04.428
I know.

03:04.468 --> 03:05.310
- Alright.
- Okay.

03:05.350 --> 03:06.868
- Go and join your friends.
- Hey, Dad.

03:06.909 --> 03:08.148
- Yeah?
- I got it.

03:08.189 --> 03:09.510
- I know you.
- Okay.

03:09.550 --> 03:10.870
- Go ahead. It's alright.

03:12.230 --> 03:13.630
Hey!

03:13.831 --> 03:16.231
- What's up?
- Hey, Max.

03:18.191 --> 03:19.830
That was so awesome, thank you.

03:19.869 --> 03:21.791
- You're welcomed.
- Hey!

03:21.830 --> 03:23.830
Don't erase your memories, Krueger.

03:23.770 --> 03:25.731
Alright, drive safe.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.992
Ow! I have something for you.

03:32.030 --> 03:33.071
Do you?

03:35.232 --> 03:37.231
- What is it?
- It's a steering wheel.

03:37.271 --> 03:39.191
I'm wearing a matching one.

03:41.191 --> 03:42.551
I love it.

03:42.751 --> 03:44.192
Thank you.

03:46.432 --> 03:48.993
It's going to be an awesome Summer.

03:49.112 --> 03:50.393
- Oh, good.

03:50.433 --> 03:51.794
And I'll get it up for all the Fall.

03:51.912 --> 03:53.278
- You do?
- Look.

03:53.313 --> 03:55.472
I know you said you're long for Columbia, but

03:55.551 --> 03:58.072
it's really not about self-control, you know?

03:58.112 --> 04:01.233
Ah come on, we can live together
in L.A, by the beach somewhere.

04:03.073 --> 04:04.432
You have a lot to figure it out, don't you?

04:04.473 --> 04:06.594

04:48.875 --> 04:50.277
Nice wing!

04:51.395 --> 04:52.835
Does it fly, too?

04:53.035 --> 04:54.797
It's a nice car.

04:54.838 --> 04:56.837
Is that a rent or you bought from your dad?

04:58.398 --> 05:04.838
Comical! You need a sense of humor
to drive something like that.

05:30.320 --> 05:32.040
That's what I thought.

Hey, I'm Markus, from Molsbroek.

Hi, I'm Danny, from Los Angeles.

Finally, someone who speaks English
that 'em might like to hear.

06:34.805 --> 06:36.325
What d'you got for, Danny?

06:36.366 --> 06:38.004
- NASCAR?
- No.

06:38.164 --> 06:40.684
- World Challenge.
- Nice! Me too.

06:40.764 --> 06:42.164
So who d'you think it gonna be?

06:42.284 --> 06:45.727
- What do you mean by that?
- I mean the top douth.

06:45.766 --> 06:47.685
- "El numero uno".
- Why?

06:47.726 --> 06:49.606
Someone is looking for an autograph?

06:49.646 --> 06:52.446
Well not unless you can archive
five championship wins at NASCAR

06:52.486 --> 06:55.245
with a little Late Model Series there,
Fish 'n Chips.

06:55.286 --> 06:56.811
How about a 7 championship wins,

06:56.846 --> 06:59.766
and British karting, SCP karting
and Super One Series.

06:59.886 --> 07:01.766
I gave up go-kart since I was 12.

07:01.806 --> 07:02.965
And you give up boys, too?

07:03.086 --> 07:05.327
Oh, the other ones just couldn't keep up.

07:06.486 --> 07:08.047
Well, I can keep up.

07:09.287 --> 07:11.529
Want to know the top douths are?

07:11.568 --> 07:13.766
Come, front.

07:13.808 --> 07:16.167
Enzo and Paulo Lauricello.

07:16.208 --> 07:19.808
They're both from the top sports
in the Coppa Italia every years they race.

07:19.847 --> 07:21.808
They have a room in the villa
just for trophies.

07:21.848 --> 07:24.049
Oh those Italians are about
to get themselves

07:24.089 --> 07:27.049
to taste Luke Lebow's sweet
Texas' tar smoke.

07:29.409 --> 07:32.208
So, what about you?
What kind of racing have you done?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.767
I won a high school's race last year.

07:37.009 --> 07:38.208
That's it?

07:41.329 --> 07:43.570
Looks like somebody brought
a baby bottle to a cocktail party.

07:51.210 --> 07:53.210
Well, well. What we've got here?

07:53.250 --> 07:55.090

08:00.850 --> 08:03.653
No phones in here, ever.

08:04.932 --> 08:07.610
The Versace twins.

08:07.650 --> 08:11.212
How 'bout you guys share those beautiful
Italian eyes with the rest of us, huh?

08:15.772 --> 08:17.331
My name is Richard Duncannon.

08:17.371 --> 08:20.133
This gentleman is Liam Sterling.

08:20.172 --> 08:22.452
He's the head of Fast Lane Racing School.

08:22.531 --> 08:25.933
We'll be instructors for the next 4 weeks.

08:27.092 --> 08:30.734
Every years we get about 3,000
applicants from all around the World.

08:30.774 --> 08:33.092
We pick only 8.

08:33.253 --> 08:34.974
Being the best which you got in here

08:35.015 --> 08:37.374
is not gonna be enough to help you graduate.

08:37.414 --> 08:41.813
Now I'm sure you think
you've got nothing left to learn.

08:41.849 --> 08:43.979
Yeah, I'll prove you wrong.

08:44.014 --> 08:47.813
And the process we can make you
better than you could ever imagine.

08:47.854 --> 08:48.940
I'm no, teach.

08:48.975 --> 08:51.374
I've got in me a pretty wild imagination.

08:56.014 --> 08:58.015
Looks like we get us a Lone Ranger, Richard.

08:59.617 --> 09:02.775
The question is - who's this Tonto?

09:02.815 --> 09:05.896
We set your program apart from
all the others is, I'm emphasis,

09:05.935 --> 09:08.936
I'm working in teams.

09:08.976 --> 09:11.617
By end of the day,
at least be assigned your partner.

09:11.657 --> 09:15.216
The difference between success and failure

09:15.257 --> 09:17.177
is collaboration.

09:17.217 --> 09:20.496
At last to pass, each and every
class requirement as a team,

09:20.531 --> 09:21.580
in order to graduate.

09:21.615 --> 09:25.058
If one of you fails, you both fail.

09:26.018 --> 09:27.018
Is that cleared?

09:28.538 --> 09:32.538
Now I know you're all anxious
to show us what you got.

09:32.658 --> 09:34.097
So go ahead and shoot up.

09:34.137 --> 09:37.737
It'll be a first of many opportunities
to humiliate yourselves.

09:44.059 --> 09:46.177
We're putting you through
a preliminary time drive

09:46.218 --> 09:47.579
to gage your current skill level.

09:49.258 --> 09:51.141
Your car is equipped with a transponder

09:51.260 --> 09:53.821
that will record your lapse times.

09:53.940 --> 09:57.539
The score board will display your
best times and keeps track of your progress.

09:57.699 --> 09:59.980
You take one warm up
and you'll find lapse seats.

10:04.260 --> 10:07.619
You're only racing against the clock,
so no riving.

10:48.024 --> 10:49.343
Ah, yes!

12:04.548 --> 12:07.349
We've got ourselves the wild bunch.

12:20.831 --> 12:22.430
That's unbelievable.

12:22.471 --> 12:24.550
Could be the fastest 1st-lapse times
I've ever seen.

12:24.590 --> 12:26.036
Why d'you think that's it, Richard?

12:26.071 --> 12:28.309
May be the track is stickier than usual?

12:28.350 --> 12:30.310
Yeah. Mike will test it for us.

12:30.430 --> 12:31.870
I'd love to.

12:31.910 --> 12:34.431
I'll take the slowest car, just to make sure.

12:43.832 --> 12:45.432
- Tough first day.
- Yeah.

12:56.752 --> 12:58.712
Maybe it's the car, Krueger.

12:59.592 --> 13:00.712
It's not the car.

13:00.752 --> 13:02.314
You slowed us down.

13:02.354 --> 13:03.880
And cost another 2/10.

13:03.915 --> 13:06.754
You see, drag racing is for the fast car.

13:06.794 --> 13:10.313
Road racing, that's for fast drivers.

13:14.392 --> 13:15.995
What d'you think, paisanos?

13:16.034 --> 13:17.914
May be we'll be teaching this thing, huh?

13:27.176 --> 13:28.617
Hey, you think that was fast?

13:28.956 --> 13:31.055
Remember we're just instructors.

13:31.590 --> 13:33.475
He's wearing not the cowboy boots.

13:34.210 --> 13:35.636
Alright, the bad news:

13:36.177 --> 13:37.616
You kids got a lot to learn.

13:37.836 --> 13:40.836
The good news:
Our friend in the World Racing team

13:40.976 --> 13:42.275
is discussing for new drivers.

13:42.315 --> 13:45.197
One month after graduation,
the toughest 2 students from this class

13:45.716 --> 13:49.575
will be back here driving for
World Racing in Lucas Oil's cup.

13:49.915 --> 13:51.216
So the biggest drivers in the world

13:51.251 --> 13:53.018
lost their career in that competition.

13:53.259 --> 13:56.318
Two among you could be next.

13:56.358 --> 13:58.458
Not with those times.

13:58.498 --> 14:01.298
Snowmen get a better chance
to get a sun tan.

14:01.338 --> 14:03.938
What Dick is trying to say is that
you get a lot of hard works outta here.

14:05.579 --> 14:07.778
You can after bring you a game.

14:09.013 --> 14:09.896
Okay, listen up!

14:10.036 --> 14:13.157
Here're teams,
teammate a room together.

14:13.192 --> 14:15.520
Enzo with Paulo, Markus with Tak,

14:15.600 --> 14:17.483
Danny with Luke.

14:17.518 --> 14:18.759
- Konichiwa!
- Tariq with Michelle...

14:18.799 --> 14:21.720
- ... in separate rooms.
- Tu, from Iowa.

14:21.920 --> 14:23.160
Got it?

14:27.319 --> 14:28.760
I'm sorry, sir.

14:28.799 --> 14:30.699
I can't be paired with Danny.

14:30.734 --> 14:33.199
He stinks and I hail a loser dork.

14:33.239 --> 14:36.480
Then you just smell like home.

14:36.520 --> 14:37.761
Follow the line, cowboy.

14:38.361 --> 14:40.961
Yes, sir.

14:46.160 --> 14:48.441
Damn! I got a mouth disease.

14:49.520 --> 14:51.686
It's a stress.

14:51.721 --> 14:53.443
You shoot a real good driving
out there today.

14:55.722 --> 14:57.603
Yeah? Well,

14:57.642 --> 15:00.042
May be a lot faster than your ass.

15:00.123 --> 15:02.520
You'd hurry learn them turn it, little dork.

15:02.561 --> 15:04.841
I won't pull us both far away.

15:04.881 --> 15:07.082
Come on, Yankee, come on.

15:17.004 --> 15:19.084
- Hey Jess.
- How's my guy?

15:19.085 --> 15:20.444
I'm good.

15:20.483 --> 15:22.403
You're okay?

15:23.684 --> 15:26.843
The rips up here are really good.

15:27.643 --> 15:29.645
You know, I mean...

15:29.805 --> 15:31.609
real good.

15:31.644 --> 15:33.644
The first day, don't be so hard on yourself.

15:35.326 --> 15:37.283
Anyway, what's news back home,
anything?

15:37.324 --> 15:39.204
Max got another speeding ticket.

15:40.524 --> 15:42.125
Would that be the third one this year?

15:42.165 --> 15:43.724
You know you'd better hurry
become a lawyer.

15:43.764 --> 15:45.485
He's gonna need you.

15:45.524 --> 15:48.725
- I miss you.
- I miss you, too.

15:54.606 --> 15:56.605
<i>"Columbia University"</i>

16:02.766 --> 16:03.966
- Ah, here we go.

16:05.046 --> 16:06.486

16:06.606 --> 16:07.926
- Ah, Gods bless America!

16:07.966 --> 16:09.486
- Amen with that, brother.

16:09.526 --> 16:11.929
If I finish all of this,
you'll give me your number, right?

16:13.926 --> 16:15.328
That's no, boss.

16:15.368 --> 16:16.649
Oh, no. She wants it.

16:16.689 --> 16:18.508
I'm crashing on this.

16:18.543 --> 16:20.327
Ah, that's no way of that.

<i>Mangia, mangia!</i>

16:23.248 --> 16:25.408
Have a heart attack.

16:25.448 --> 16:27.167
You want less driver?

16:27.208 --> 16:29.007
You still have me
to worry about, sweetheart.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.248
Who's worried?

16:30.409 --> 16:32.447
If your partner gets any slower,

16:32.488 --> 16:34.528
I'll have to race on motor tri-cycle.

16:40.488 --> 16:42.371
- Sorry.
- What?

16:42.411 --> 16:44.050
Come on.

16:45.571 --> 16:46.571
Sensitive.

16:50.929 --> 16:54.370
Hey, don't let them get you.

16:54.410 --> 16:56.210
Just trying with what you have.

16:56.251 --> 16:58.010
Yeah, think their heads up.

16:58.129 --> 16:59.731
Sure.

17:01.369 --> 17:02.972
So how d'you get into racing?

17:04.931 --> 17:07.330
Well, I'm the youngest among three.

17:07.371 --> 17:09.692
And my elder brothers are rally racers.

17:09.732 --> 17:11.732
They take after our dad.

17:11.771 --> 17:13.252
So I don't know. I wanna fit in

17:13.290 --> 17:16.372
So when I was 14 I started
to sit down my dad's pickup

17:16.412 --> 17:19.452
and I thought myself, better race
on a fractural road

17:19.492 --> 17:22.613
Two weeks after my 16th birthday,

17:22.652 --> 17:25.132
I won a local championship,
and the rest is history.

17:25.171 --> 17:27.851
I'm impressed. A Canadian
who doesn't like hockey?

17:27.890 --> 17:29.413
I love hockey.

17:29.453 --> 17:31.134
I just rather be behind the wheel, you know?

17:31.174 --> 17:33.734
Which shows you're fast.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.375
Thanks.

17:35.415 --> 17:37.015
I could be faster.

17:37.054 --> 17:38.295
Hey, my philosophy is simple.

17:38.334 --> 17:40.493
You wanna be fast,
you'd gonna know your car.

17:40.654 --> 17:42.054
Stretch straight up the engine block.

17:43.413 --> 17:45.293
Oh, the cowboy's philosophy now, huh?

17:45.453 --> 17:48.133
When it comes to engine,
you're damn right I am.

17:48.173 --> 17:50.814
Oh I guess you'd know anything
about it, would you?

17:50.894 --> 17:54.215
Or it's time you get your hand
'cos you're doing for each other's tare.

17:58.657 --> 18:00.416
Let the Philosophy talks.

18:00.457 --> 18:03.214
If you're fast, you would be number three.

18:04.815 --> 18:07.656
My old man sees my lapse time
he will kick my ass.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.655
Uhm, so it's in your blood, too.

18:09.695 --> 18:12.336
Yeah, it was in a little.

18:12.375 --> 18:14.976
I used to travel with them in a team.

18:15.016 --> 18:17.577
- When he's a driver for NASCAR, so you know?
- Cool.

18:17.775 --> 18:20.135
He taught me everything I know
about racing, and cars,

18:20.176 --> 18:21.336
and never knows I'm addicted to everything.

18:21.375 --> 18:23.016
Anytime you want, though.

18:23.056 --> 18:24.577
That's it. Let's go outside...

18:24.616 --> 18:26.097
Absolutely.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.577
- Go ahead!
- Calm.

18:34.619 --> 18:36.218
I'm fine.

18:36.258 --> 18:37.738
It's alright.

18:37.777 --> 18:41.177
And there we go, my teammate.
Lucky me.

18:41.217 --> 18:42.217
- Take it easy.
- No, it's alright.

18:42.257 --> 18:44.258
Don't you worry.
You're right, you're right.

18:44.379 --> 18:45.698
You know something?

18:45.859 --> 18:48.740
Sorry, no way in hell. I don't let
the pizza boys get away with that.

18:48.779 --> 18:50.738
- Hey, look at you.
- Luke!

18:50.778 --> 18:52.260
Luke!

18:52.300 --> 18:53.300
My God!

18:55.181 --> 18:57.298
Wait, guys, the food...

18:59.540 --> 19:00.780
Check, please.

19:04.618 --> 19:06.460
Hey, come on.

19:36.982 --> 19:37.982
What you gonna do?

19:39.021 --> 19:40.582
Très bien!

19:40.743 --> 19:42.302
Let's send the cowboy back to Texas.

20:01.584 --> 20:03.064
Little bit closer!

20:05.466 --> 20:06.666
Little bit closer!

20:17.865 --> 20:19.946
Oh, he's been in a hole in ass.

20:24.227 --> 20:25.426
Oh my God!

20:33.425 --> 20:34.505
What happened?

20:34.545 --> 20:35.546
Call 911.

20:35.585 --> 20:38.786
- Hey, you alright?
- I think I've broken my leg.

20:40.228 --> 20:41.627
Enzo, it's been too tract.

20:41.667 --> 20:42.867
Jesus!

20:42.907 --> 20:44.066
Come I did talk.

20:45.988 --> 20:48.268
One less driver.

20:50.828 --> 20:52.588
My God!

20:53.389 --> 20:57.713
In 14 years, I have never had
an incident like this.

20:57.748 --> 21:01.387
If any of you guys prove a Vin Diesel
stuff like this again, off the track!

21:01.427 --> 21:03.789
You're out of... Hey!

21:03.829 --> 21:06.110
You're out of here.

21:06.150 --> 21:08.551
Which brings us to an ex-order business.

21:10.471 --> 21:12.910
How did things get this far, Krueger?

21:12.990 --> 21:14.190
I had nothing to do with this.

21:14.230 --> 21:15.310
Don't you get it?

21:15.350 --> 21:17.110
That's exactly your problem.

21:17.270 --> 21:19.509
As a team, you're responsible
for each other.

21:19.548 --> 21:21.948
Even if your partner do something
foolish off the track

21:21.988 --> 21:25.070
It's the other's job to rail him back in.

21:25.149 --> 21:27.489
Understand?

21:27.524 --> 21:29.829
What about Enzo? Huh?

21:29.870 --> 21:31.550
I mean, he is engaged the entire thing.

21:31.590 --> 21:34.872
Yes, may be. But by always I can't see
backed off when things got serious.

21:35.032 --> 21:36.672
It's Luke's wish to let it go.

21:36.712 --> 21:37.911
That's the stubborn Hill Billy.

21:38.110 --> 21:41.831
That stubborn Hill Billy was your partner.

21:41.910 --> 21:44.193
You can't continue without one.

21:44.232 --> 21:46.071
Your only chance to stay in here

21:46.112 --> 21:48.113
is we can find you a new partner

21:48.153 --> 21:50.031
Start!

21:50.071 --> 21:51.632
Alright, let's see.

21:51.672 --> 21:54.032
Mullen's in Europal summer.

21:54.072 --> 21:56.472
DeLuca committed another school.

21:56.670 --> 21:59.192
Ramsey looks too far away,
he can never make it in our time.

21:59.232 --> 22:01.433
It's not looking good, kid.

22:03.034 --> 22:04.314
Wait!

22:04.355 --> 22:06.473
Somebody might know?

22:06.508 --> 22:08.794
Oh, no, not... not him. No!

22:12.794 --> 22:15.753
- He lives nearby and available.
- Done some karting,

22:15.792 --> 22:17.353
has been in our waiting list twice.

22:17.392 --> 22:18.713
No, it got to be somebody else.

22:18.913 --> 22:20.594
There is no one else.

22:22.155 --> 22:23.915
We should go forfeiting
this year's scholarship.

22:23.955 --> 22:25.315
We'll place it next year.

22:25.355 --> 22:27.716
That's World Racing Patrol,
be upper graph.

22:31.755 --> 22:34.355
Sometimes the devil you know
is better than the one you don't.

22:59.917 --> 23:01.537
Somebody misses me?

23:01.572 --> 23:03.158
No, I like it they go.

23:09.836 --> 23:12.918
Hey, switch in the World Racing
is bold move, man.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.639
Yeah.

23:14.759 --> 23:16.398
You steal lapse for me, too?

23:17.438 --> 23:19.237
Good to see things haven't changed.

23:20.438 --> 23:23.520
Well, if this isn't Jake Kendal?

23:23.641 --> 23:25.919
How're you eager, beaver?

23:25.959 --> 23:27.639
That's the hell ever quick trip,

23:27.760 --> 23:30.598
- just pumped to be here, sir.
- Good.

23:30.638 --> 23:32.359
Well, first thing first.

23:32.559 --> 23:33.799
Let's see what you got.

24:54.466 --> 24:56.465
Not the hell, he got above me 1/10.

24:56.606 --> 24:58.367
Not bad.

25:00.167 --> 25:03.646
Yeah, not for first time back on the track.

25:03.685 --> 25:07.126
Looks like your new partner.
He's close to a series killer, right?

25:08.247 --> 25:11.367
Let's get a move, all.
We have a lot to get to.

25:18.969 --> 25:20.608
What the...

25:23.129 --> 25:25.848
- Why you moved my stuffs?
- 'Cos in my bed.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.727
I want a bed by the window.

25:30.888 --> 25:32.648
Yeah, then you shoot the guy here first.

25:32.687 --> 25:34.088
Ah, you're more appall than usual.

25:34.127 --> 25:35.488
Is certain thing I shouldn't be here?

25:35.527 --> 25:37.970
Why would I think that?
I earned my spot.

25:38.011 --> 25:40.289
Because of your lapse times?

25:40.329 --> 25:42.649
No, the only reason you're here
because my motor blew.

25:42.690 --> 25:45.650
You can re-write history all you want
but stick with the fact, okay?

25:45.729 --> 25:47.730
You blew your motor. No one else.

25:47.765 --> 25:49.254
Oh, here's the fact.

25:49.289 --> 25:51.133
Your scholarship should've been
mine all along

25:51.168 --> 25:53.769
and now that I'm here, it only proves it.

25:53.809 --> 25:56.489
- It's faith, Danny.
- It's not faith, man.

25:56.529 --> 25:58.011
Proximity.

25:58.051 --> 26:00.609
You see, because I picked
your name off a very short list.

26:00.771 --> 26:02.051
But not because you're the best.

26:02.251 --> 26:03.532
Because you're available.

26:03.572 --> 26:07.052
Look, I'm here to win,
even after drag you along with me.

26:07.172 --> 26:09.371
Either one is dead race, Danny.

26:09.411 --> 26:11.171
You just don't know yet.

26:15.372 --> 26:17.372
Hey, Jess.

26:18.652 --> 26:22.212
Nothing, I... Look.
I don't wanna talk right now, OK?

26:22.247 --> 26:24.172
Let me call you back, though.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.771
Bye.

26:32.054 --> 26:34.973
Yeah, I felt great.
Getting behind the wheel again driving,

26:35.013 --> 26:36.533
ways better than I thought.

26:36.573 --> 26:38.055
God! You should check if this real.

26:38.215 --> 26:40.094
Hey, I know you could make it, son.

26:40.254 --> 26:43.374
Yeah, I made 5th place on my first run.

26:43.414 --> 26:45.093
Well, started like this is being expected.

26:45.132 --> 26:48.093
Next time I call I expect it
the 1st place lapse time.

26:48.253 --> 26:50.333
Yes, sir!

26:51.413 --> 26:55.815
Dad, when I graduate,
it gonna be just like we said.

26:55.855 --> 26:59.056
A Kendal name on a real race car.

26:59.091 --> 27:00.301
I promise.

27:00.336 --> 27:03.135
Why? Why it's only one
but not the whole team?

27:03.255 --> 27:05.256
Yes, sir.

27:07.814 --> 27:11.216
Now, making the crack line to turn 9

27:11.255 --> 27:15.977
with speeds ever 100-130 or else.
135 miles now.

27:17.177 --> 27:18.736
Danny.

27:18.777 --> 27:21.216
Just come up here.
Show us how you take.

27:36.939 --> 27:38.298
Sir?

27:38.498 --> 27:40.579
Jake. You don't agree?

27:40.618 --> 27:42.178
No, no I don't, sir.

27:42.217 --> 27:43.378
Alright.

27:49.698 --> 27:52.899
Now you need a late apex
so you can ply power earlier.

27:52.979 --> 27:55.260
to maximize your speed on thrust away.

28:00.059 --> 28:03.100
Which gives you more options
if you wanna overtake.

28:03.139 --> 28:05.140
Yes, sir.

28:06.860 --> 28:09.061
Hey, I'm available for trooping after class.

28:09.140 --> 28:11.780
We're gonna do that.

28:11.820 --> 28:14.700
Taking the crack line is
only half the equation.

28:14.741 --> 28:19.341
Having absolute control in your car
through that line, the other happens.

28:19.782 --> 28:22.241
This afternoon we'll start with
the leap-follow exercise.

28:22.276 --> 28:25.701
Faster teammate will lead
the slower teammate

28:25.741 --> 28:28.822
through the track till they're able
to match the speed

28:28.862 --> 28:30.463
Then you'll switch positions.

28:37.022 --> 28:38.502
Nice track, Tak.

28:38.542 --> 28:40.023
OK, let's switch.

28:48.583 --> 28:50.306
Hey, what takes it so long?

28:50.341 --> 28:51.943
Danny's been in five lapses

28:52.025 --> 28:53.225
You should kart up by now, buddy.

28:56.504 --> 28:58.504
How's the view from back there?

28:58.544 --> 29:00.505
You should see it yourself.

29:03.584 --> 29:07.144
Slower so you always see
the back of the class, Krueger.

29:08.463 --> 29:10.183
Come on, man. It's my turn to lead.

29:10.223 --> 29:12.466
You want to lead?
Come and get it.

29:15.265 --> 29:17.146
Come on, man. Don't be a jerk.

29:17.185 --> 29:18.825
Paulo.

29:18.865 --> 29:20.186
Andiamo!

29:20.227 --> 29:21.546
Andiamo!

29:25.465 --> 29:27.945
No, no, if you want to lead,
you need to get in front of me, Danny.

29:30.625 --> 29:32.466
Hey, guys!
You need some help?

29:32.626 --> 29:35.666
Follow me. I'll show you how.

29:37.106 --> 29:39.428
May be you guys need a little push, huh?

29:41.507 --> 29:43.268
Hey guys, do you like music?

29:43.388 --> 29:44.868
Let me sing a song for you.

29:44.908 --> 29:48.007
Follow the leader, leader, leader.
Follow the leader, see I'm here.

29:51.868 --> 29:54.668
Enzo, come on.
Tell them to go a little bit faster.

29:58.868 --> 30:00.608
- Come on.
- Enzo, Paulo,

30:00.643 --> 30:02.348
what the hell you're doing out there?

30:02.387 --> 30:04.228
- Get off the track.
- I can't believe these guys.

30:04.263 --> 30:05.263
Those idiots.

30:13.949 --> 30:15.389
Danny.

30:24.109 --> 30:25.349
How was that view?

30:25.509 --> 30:26.990
Bravo, nice stunt!

30:28.750 --> 30:31.151
You'll compromise your life.

30:32.351 --> 30:35.032
You know, man.
At least the kids know handling.

30:35.712 --> 30:37.912
Okay, not bad, not bad.

30:37.947 --> 30:40.112
Thing's looking up to you.

30:40.231 --> 30:41.796
You think so?

30:41.831 --> 30:44.631
What you did on the track earlier
was impressive.

30:44.671 --> 30:47.070
Yeah, well, didn't help on
my lapse time very much.

30:47.110 --> 30:50.993
Yeah, but still that's an impressive
car control.

30:52.712 --> 30:55.514
The total snitches are fed in here.

30:57.112 --> 30:58.671
Yes!

30:58.712 --> 31:00.833
I'm telling you, Frankfurt,

31:00.873 --> 31:03.153
The only reason me and
my brother came to America

31:03.273 --> 31:05.193
just because, this is the real money is.

31:08.394 --> 31:10.794
Suppose to you, 2 o'clock.

31:12.034 --> 31:14.272
Now things are getting interesting.

31:15.432 --> 31:17.234
I'll be back.

31:21.154 --> 31:23.395
Let the Italian show you how it's done.

31:25.034 --> 31:27.394
Hey, I'll get this one.

31:27.596 --> 31:28.797
Hey, Danny, Danny.

31:29.956 --> 31:31.115
Come one.

31:31.156 --> 31:34.114
That's the Ferrari, not the Chevy.

31:34.156 --> 31:35.315
You can't handle it.

31:35.355 --> 31:37.355
Or a hundred bucks just say I can.

31:38.154 --> 31:41.314
I'll make it 200, but I'm afraid
you cannot afford it.

31:41.355 --> 31:43.396
I'll make it 200, now.

31:46.157 --> 31:47.757
Good luck, my friend.

31:50.596 --> 31:52.476
I give him 30 seconds.

31:52.516 --> 31:54.598
I mean it's top and he's done.
Finish.

31:56.477 --> 31:58.076
Oh, no.

31:58.237 --> 31:59.876
I mean this job is done.

31:59.916 --> 32:01.477
Any take it?

32:01.517 --> 32:04.076
What were you... just looking at?

32:06.237 --> 32:07.997
Krueger is just about to a crashing burnt.

32:13.037 --> 32:15.678
Yeah, it's the... they're on fire.

32:17.679 --> 32:18.957
Yeah.

32:18.898 --> 32:21.579
I don't think it finishes in such a while.
So pay up.

32:31.240 --> 32:34.080
Ah, I can't believe you drove
all the way out here.

32:34.241 --> 32:35.280
You had me worried.

32:35.440 --> 32:37.599
You weren't returning my call, or text.

32:37.639 --> 32:39.160
Oh, I'm sorry.

32:39.200 --> 32:41.400
It's got a lot of my mind, you know?

32:41.441 --> 32:43.601
- You mean Jake?
- No.

32:44.799 --> 32:47.160
Get a room, my birds.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.121
Hey, Jess.

32:49.161 --> 32:50.801
What brings you up here?

32:50.840 --> 32:52.361
For making sure you 2 behave yourselves.

32:52.401 --> 32:55.323
We're team players.
Right, Krueger?

32:55.362 --> 32:56.563
- Yeah.
- Fine

32:57.402 --> 32:59.682
- Hey, where are you going?
- Where the night brings me.

32:59.722 --> 33:03.762
Oh, by the way. I never had a chance
to thank you for the followers

33:03.922 --> 33:05.402
you sent me to stand up.

33:05.522 --> 33:07.081
They really brighten up the room.

33:12.922 --> 33:14.763
What?

33:14.802 --> 33:16.522
Come on.

33:16.563 --> 33:17.722
Flowers, Jess?

33:17.762 --> 33:20.723
During the hospital and followers
is great thing to do.

33:20.883 --> 33:23.122
After everything that he tried to do to me?

33:23.282 --> 33:24.684
It told you have been nice.

33:24.723 --> 33:26.084
I'm nice.

33:26.243 --> 33:29.444
Seriously, Danny?
I didn't drive up here for that.

33:29.484 --> 33:30.603
Of, then what's the reason
you drove here for?

33:30.645 --> 33:33.125
I came because I was concerned about you.

33:33.284 --> 33:35.403
And I even convinced myself for moving to L.A

33:35.564 --> 33:37.524
with you might not be my compromise.

33:37.564 --> 33:40.723
Wait, wait. A compromise?
Why it'll be a compromise?

33:46.606 --> 33:49.567
'Cos you gonna be in Columbia.

33:49.606 --> 33:51.886
Wow, good for you.

33:51.925 --> 33:53.926
So, you wanna move to New York.

33:54.046 --> 33:55.246
When you'll tell me?

33:55.287 --> 33:58.045
When you're back.
I don't want it to distract you.

33:59.205 --> 34:00.604
After everything we talked about?

34:00.645 --> 34:03.206
You talked about it, Danny.
You never asked if I want it.

34:03.246 --> 34:05.567
But what is that you want?

34:05.646 --> 34:07.245
Because that's sure there hasn't us.

34:07.286 --> 34:09.206
It's not fair.
I never said that.

34:11.208 --> 34:12.888
- I can't do this right now.
- Danny!

34:12.969 --> 34:15.167
- Talk to me.
- What's the point?

34:42.728 --> 34:44.650
Oh, I thought I was in the men's room.

34:44.690 --> 34:46.889
You are.

34:46.929 --> 34:48.329
The shower in my dome don't work.

34:48.489 --> 34:51.170
Yeah, well. That sounds
you don't use it often, huh?

34:53.050 --> 34:56.290
I mean, hey... I can come back later.

34:56.330 --> 34:59.090
Why? So I can be naked?

35:00.210 --> 35:02.852
You look tired. Long night?

35:04.771 --> 35:06.772
Yeah, a kinda.

35:06.853 --> 35:10.050
She's a cute... girlfriend.

35:11.930 --> 35:14.772
- You guys will get a long?
- I'd rather not to talk about it, okay?

35:15.651 --> 35:17.411
Okay.

35:17.451 --> 35:19.531
Problems?

35:19.571 --> 35:21.612
No.

35:21.651 --> 35:23.853
Not any more.

35:23.973 --> 35:25.252
We broke up.

35:27.611 --> 35:31.732
You know, she just doesn't get it.
You know, what I'm trying up here.

35:31.772 --> 35:35.972
I'm here for a passion for racing.
Very few people understands.

35:36.933 --> 35:38.972
So it's the problem for you, too?

35:39.093 --> 35:42.134
Of course.

35:42.175 --> 35:46.854
It's intimidating for a guy bearing
the girl does something so physical,

35:46.893 --> 35:50.493
and surrounded by many other guys.

35:53.253 --> 35:54.974
So how d'you deal with that?

35:56.453 --> 35:59.295
I date guys who understand.

36:04.255 --> 36:06.375
You should smile more often.

36:14.175 --> 36:14.975
Wow!

36:15.516 --> 36:17.336
I've never seen any Canadian
with tanned line before.

36:19.016 --> 36:21.416
I hope I wasn't interrupting foreign relations?

36:21.455 --> 36:23.455
I was just leaving.

36:23.495 --> 36:25.816
Oh, come on. I thought you people
like the Americans.

36:25.856 --> 36:28.217
- We do, just not the arrogant one.
- Oh!

36:45.938 --> 36:48.778
Alright, ladies and gentlemen.
In today's exercise

36:48.819 --> 36:51.577
you'll be working on your communications skill.

36:51.698 --> 36:54.139
You take turn driving and co-piloting.

36:54.179 --> 36:57.738
Drivers must take direction
from their co-pilots.

37:11.260 --> 37:13.259
- Yeah.
- Maybe a little bit...

37:13.300 --> 37:15.219
a little bit more throttle.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.900
You want to hit the apex,
and retreat back out.

37:19.102 --> 37:22.622
You are 4/10 faster this time, Enzo.
Bravo!

37:34.760 --> 37:37.821
- Oh, man...
- Hey, what're you doing late on tonight?

37:43.502 --> 37:44.902
That's it, Markus.

37:45.983 --> 37:47.424
Still the gap the whole time.

37:49.824 --> 37:51.143
Push it, push it!

37:51.182 --> 37:53.703
Why are you breaking.
You've got to work with me.

37:53.823 --> 37:56.343
You can have way more speed
coming down here.

38:01.145 --> 38:03.784
What did I tell you?

38:03.823 --> 38:06.384
Well, they should beat you.

38:06.425 --> 38:08.382
These two, so ridiculous.

38:08.422 --> 38:11.583
It's fun. Like watching dogs
fighting for scrap.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.186
Doberman right here,
snapping on your hits.

38:14.226 --> 38:16.146
Oh yeah.

38:16.186 --> 38:19.345
Very good. Enjoy!

38:19.386 --> 38:22.146
Tomorrow, it'll be nothing but a memory.

38:23.707 --> 38:25.706
Forget it, come on.

38:28.904 --> 38:31.145
Is that what you two call teamwork?

38:31.265 --> 38:35.906
Everybody else's pushing better times,
except for the two you guys.

38:35.946 --> 38:40.588
This time, let's start dropping,
or we will drop both of you.

38:40.708 --> 38:43.427
- Understood?
- Alright.

38:59.429 --> 39:02.707
Starring at your phone is not
gonna make him call.

39:02.869 --> 39:04.109
I know.

39:04.228 --> 39:06.747
Oh, call him.

39:06.787 --> 39:08.869
Why?

39:08.909 --> 39:12.469
Purity hasn't mis-happened, I'm trading
him in for an ivy leaguer's education.

39:14.428 --> 39:16.590
Does he knows how much this means to you?

39:17.509 --> 39:20.589
- Not really.
- Then explain it.

39:20.629 --> 39:23.789
If you wanna be a lawyer you're gonna
have to learn to argue your case.

39:25.550 --> 39:28.830
Like your daddy used to say:
"You got a name to claim it."

39:28.870 --> 39:31.750
I never know he meant by that.

39:32.590 --> 39:35.752
How you're gonna get what you need
from someone if you're afraid to ask?

39:39.150 --> 39:41.392
What if he won't listen?

39:44.150 --> 39:46.191
The you're talking to the wrong person.

39:48.111 --> 39:51.911
And it'd better you find out,
sooner or later. Okay?

40:08.274 --> 40:10.233
So, this is where you've been hiding.

40:10.272 --> 40:11.552
Yeah.

40:11.712 --> 40:14.314
Just studying up a few...

40:14.354 --> 40:17.674
assured racing techniques.

40:17.714 --> 40:20.354
Wow, boy is determined, I know.

40:22.514 --> 40:24.794
Oh, I think this belongs to you.

40:26.074 --> 40:28.436
- Thank you.
- Sure

40:29.276 --> 40:30.596
Thanks.

40:31.955 --> 40:34.156
We're going to the Stagecoach.
Wanna come?

40:35.175 --> 40:39.995
Ah... no, I, you know.
I'm staying, study.

40:40.037 --> 40:42.156
Can't say that I buy meal.

40:42.196 --> 40:44.397
- Food there is pretty bad.
- It is.

40:46.396 --> 40:48.797
We could go somewhere else?

40:49.756 --> 40:51.156
Just the two of us.

40:57.316 --> 41:01.117
I really appreciate the offer.
But it's not a good idea.

41:05.518 --> 41:08.478
Yeah, I know. I... understand.

41:10.157 --> 41:13.278
You should study.
You need it.

41:45.679 --> 41:48.599
<i>It's Danny, leave your message
or I'll text you later...</i>

42:32.204 --> 42:34.043
You need to turn it way earlier.

42:34.205 --> 42:36.443
You're still way wide.

42:36.483 --> 42:38.802
You see it outside, we're out here

42:38.843 --> 42:42.245
You ought be inside, closer to the line.

42:45.045 --> 42:47.526
Danny, you're 3/10 slower than I am.

42:51.486 --> 42:53.206
Brake! Brake!

42:55.447 --> 42:58.544
- Hold the track.
- You brake way too early there.

42:58.485 --> 43:00.104
Then why's my average's been high?

43:00.144 --> 43:01.365
I don't know.
You're doing something wrong.

43:01.405 --> 43:03.525
- My lapses are better than yours.
- Yeah, that's the way you like.

43:03.687 --> 43:05.466
- Got something to say, then you say it.
- Yes, I do.

43:05.501 --> 43:07.246
Jesus, Krueger, turn!

43:08.486 --> 43:09.566
- Jesus!

43:19.207 --> 43:20.966
Great car control skill, man.

43:21.008 --> 43:22.767
Yeah, maybe you had that in your direction.

43:22.808 --> 43:24.007
What's wrong with my direction?

43:24.042 --> 43:25.567
Oh, bullshit.

43:25.607 --> 43:27.366
You tried to mess with me
so that you can stay ahead.

43:27.406 --> 43:29.128
So what you're gonna do next, huh?
Come my brake lines again?

43:29.207 --> 43:31.009
Come on, let it go, Krueger.

43:31.049 --> 43:32.728
- I never touched your car.
- Yeah, that's right

43:32.768 --> 43:35.128
You never get your hands dirty,
with daddy paid people before.

43:46.128 --> 43:47.209
Bravo, team America!

43:47.249 --> 43:50.050
- Yes, team America.
- Keep it up!

43:50.089 --> 43:52.969
Yeah, very good.
Precious!

44:20.332 --> 44:21.852
Good work.

44:26.770 --> 44:28.772
Almost.

44:29.852 --> 44:32.534
Hey Frankfurt. I told you.

44:32.574 --> 44:35.253
You're still hesitating on turn 9,

44:35.292 --> 44:36.612
I saw it.

44:36.654 --> 44:41.175
If you want to keep up,
you need to take that turn like...

44:41.215 --> 44:43.974
Yeah, like a man. Huh?

44:48.014 --> 44:50.534
- One more round.
- No, man. Take a break.

44:50.575 --> 44:52.895
- Get a step away...
- Let's go.

45:01.735 --> 45:03.695
You two are embracement.

45:03.735 --> 45:06.335
Yeah, well. I'm sorry, sir.
But I cannot work with this...

45:06.375 --> 45:09.297
Whoa! Work with them -
you won't work with them

45:09.337 --> 45:10.937
is a big difference.

45:10.976 --> 45:14.096
That's how you feel, pack your back,
get the hell out of here.

45:14.176 --> 45:15.777
You waste my time.

45:20.297 --> 45:21.979
What's up that?

45:22.014 --> 45:23.774
Easy, Markus. Easy!

45:37.258 --> 45:38.977
Corner too fast.

45:39.017 --> 45:40.697
Tu, it'll be my fastest lapse.

45:40.737 --> 45:42.457
Slow down. Slow down!

45:55.820 --> 45:59.179
Hey Mike.
Get your team to turn 9, now.

46:45.823 --> 46:47.423
That's right.

46:47.504 --> 46:49.505
Take along how it looked.

46:50.624 --> 46:53.902
'Cos that's reality to face
when you drive beyond your skills.

46:54.983 --> 46:57.142
You are each other's checks in balances.

46:57.184 --> 46:59.422
You stop listening to your partner,

46:59.462 --> 47:01.664
consequence can be deadly.

47:01.783 --> 47:03.663
Markus and Tak are lucky.

47:03.783 --> 47:05.624
They're be back,

47:05.664 --> 47:07.665
not in this class.

47:12.784 --> 47:16.385
I'm pretty sure you and Kendal
be the first one to hit the wall.

47:18.600 --> 47:19.600
You are on a team.

47:19.624 --> 47:21.825
You're couple of rocking balls,
playing last man standing.

47:21.865 --> 47:22.986
Yeah, I never wanna be his...

47:23.025 --> 47:25.185
Why the hell you think you're chosen, Danny?

47:25.986 --> 47:28.425
You can pick your family,
or can pick your team?

47:28.465 --> 47:29.705
Not when you're a rookie.

47:29.746 --> 47:31.705
You take what you're given
and you make it works.

47:32.907 --> 47:35.746
How the hell you think
Duncannon and I got started?

47:37.145 --> 47:38.307
Yeah.

47:39.306 --> 47:42.867
Look, if you're gonna do this,

47:42.907 --> 47:45.167
you've got to stop going after
each other's weaknesses,

47:45.207 --> 47:48.027
and start focusing on your strength, son.

47:49.667 --> 47:51.747
So what's the perch you haven't tried?

48:13.828 --> 48:15.469
You alright?

48:15.509 --> 48:18.670
- You'd better learn how to punch.
- That's what I meant.

48:18.709 --> 48:20.949
But next time be sure to knock
the chip off your shoulder,

48:20.989 --> 48:22.269
at least, then we'll have chance.

48:22.308 --> 48:25.151
You're the one with the chip on the shoulder.

48:25.190 --> 48:27.950
Given our history, can you blame me?

48:31.790 --> 48:34.350
Sterling's right, you know?

48:34.472 --> 48:37.191
If we don't get it together,
we might on walk now.

48:44.831 --> 48:49.151
Okay, look. You take the track
better than I do. I admit that.

48:49.192 --> 48:51.953
But you're not carrying enough speed.

48:51.988 --> 48:53.752
That's why I'm always catching up to you.

48:53.793 --> 48:56.153
Just level with me, what's really going on?

48:57.751 --> 49:00.911
I'm having hard time pushing
the car to its limit.

49:02.073 --> 49:03.354
So you keep breaking early?

49:06.914 --> 49:09.354
Okay, then you help me with my line

49:09.475 --> 49:11.115
and I'll help you to speed up.

49:13.754 --> 49:16.172
Look, Jake.
There're 2 spots available in here

49:16.207 --> 49:18.592
and there's no reason that
we can't win them both.

49:19.952 --> 49:21.034
Are you in?

49:42.956 --> 49:44.836
Rise 'n shine, Kendal.

49:47.796 --> 49:50.075
Unless you hit a car, go away.

49:51.154 --> 49:53.155
Come on, get up already.

49:54.075 --> 49:55.797
Let's go.

50:00.398 --> 50:03.197
And here's another one
you turn way too soon.

50:03.238 --> 50:04.997
And use the track more.

50:05.037 --> 50:06.759
Remember the rule?

50:06.798 --> 50:08.657
Slower the turn, the later the apex.

50:08.692 --> 50:10.516
You've got to set yourself up the turn 4, man.

50:10.558 --> 50:12.117
That's the double apex.

50:12.317 --> 50:14.082
Yeah.

50:14.117 --> 50:16.916
Yeah, that's the other tricky one.

50:16.956 --> 50:19.638
Speaking up tricky one,

50:19.678 --> 50:21.277
what's up with you and Michelle?

50:22.920 --> 50:24.520
Nothing.

50:24.560 --> 50:27.279
So what was that in locker room
the other day?

50:29.240 --> 50:31.679
Was a mistake.

50:31.719 --> 50:34.079
Can we continue with this, please?

50:35.159 --> 50:38.079
Or we used to crush, blind, obviously.

51:03.401 --> 51:06.761
Stay wide.

51:08.041 --> 51:09.281
Now!

51:10.761 --> 51:12.041
Yeah!

51:15.242 --> 51:17.243
That's three on road and
we got 1/10 each other.

51:17.283 --> 51:18.445
and I think this got it.

51:20.404 --> 51:22.803
Then how the hell the altered car
you ruled so well?

51:22.838 --> 51:23.968
This gotta be smoother.
And I'll show you.

51:24.003 --> 51:26.524
Stand on one leg.

51:26.564 --> 51:27.928
If I do this, what happens?

51:27.963 --> 51:30.724
- Hey, take it easy.
- What happens?

51:30.763 --> 51:32.483
- I loose my balance.
- Right.

51:32.523 --> 51:35.284
Now I apply the exact same
amount of pressure, smoother

51:35.324 --> 51:37.525
you'll come to feel it and you lean in it.

51:37.560 --> 51:39.725
So drive your car in the same way.
Drive it smooth.

51:39.764 --> 51:42.884
That way if it starts to loose,
you'll have time to react to get it back.

51:42.924 --> 51:44.085
It's genius.

51:50.926 --> 51:54.045
Slowly and wider steering, right?
Here is the apex.

51:57.885 --> 52:00.845
Nice, man! 7 miles an hour faster.

52:02.606 --> 52:03.851
Yeah!

52:03.886 --> 52:05.447
Yeah, buddy.

52:05.487 --> 52:08.206
So what's going on with you and Jessica?

52:08.286 --> 52:09.926
I'll get some short time to figure it out.

52:09.966 --> 52:12.647
I wouldn't wait too long. I wouldn't.

52:12.687 --> 52:16.287
You got a girl who drove all the way
out here because she cared.

52:17.408 --> 52:19.487
You don't know how rare there is
until you're laid in hospital bed

52:19.527 --> 52:22.607
and it's the only people come
to visit you and your parents.

52:23.808 --> 52:26.049
Trust me.

52:30.028 --> 52:31.608
Going up there on August.

52:31.647 --> 52:33.647
My mom's going with me,
about a week, you know.

52:33.682 --> 52:35.287
To help me to settle in.

52:35.408 --> 52:37.128
Hey, Jess.

52:37.168 --> 52:39.170
- How're you doin'?
- Fine.

52:41.208 --> 52:42.334
- What d'you do after here?

52:42.369 --> 52:44.808
My boy Tony got a house
for the raging up the canyon.

52:44.849 --> 52:47.208
- Wanna go?
- No, thanks.

52:47.248 --> 52:48.329
I'm good.

52:48.370 --> 52:49.689
You're single, right?

52:49.731 --> 52:51.329
At least, that's the rumor.

52:51.369 --> 52:54.529
- Where did you hear that?
- Good news travels fast.

52:54.568 --> 52:55.930
Does it?

52:57.290 --> 52:59.930
- What're you doin' here?
- I need to talk to you.

53:00.129 --> 53:02.170
Oh that's not when you're ready
to talk and I'm supposed to listen.

53:02.210 --> 53:04.130
You're the one who walked away.

53:04.170 --> 53:06.012
Damn, Krueger. That must stop.

53:06.052 --> 53:08.411
Jess, please, I'm sorry.

53:08.451 --> 53:10.131
- Give me five minutes.
- Get the hit, man

53:10.171 --> 53:12.351
- She's not interested.
- Why don't you stay out of this.

53:12.386 --> 53:14.531
Whoa, you never play football, man.

53:14.572 --> 53:16.092
All this bumble's embarrassing.

53:16.292 --> 53:18.692
Yeah?
Your team was nasty for how long?

53:18.813 --> 53:20.212
Brock!

53:22.388 --> 53:23.388
Really, Krueger?

53:23.412 --> 53:25.293
- You wanna do this?
- Yeah.

53:27.512 --> 53:29.411
What if I hurt that? Tell her I'm win it.

53:29.452 --> 53:31.490
Tell it to my boys.

53:34.613 --> 53:36.214
Stop!

53:37.854 --> 53:39.814
We'll go, okay?

53:39.933 --> 53:41.253
You can have her.

53:47.173 --> 53:49.174
What d'you want us to talk?

53:50.013 --> 53:52.012
Look...

53:56.294 --> 54:00.576
Ever since I got to Willow Springs,
I've been struggling to keep up.

54:00.736 --> 54:04.216
Everyone there is ways more
experienced than I am.

54:04.255 --> 54:06.416
And then I loose my partner
and this prick Jake

54:06.454 --> 54:08.135
forfeited my scholarship.

54:08.175 --> 54:11.775
Ever since he got there,
I've been looking over my shoulder.

54:11.815 --> 54:13.335
Except today.

54:14.535 --> 54:17.095
This is the first day I can actually breath.

54:17.136 --> 54:19.696
You think saying all that
can make things better?

54:19.736 --> 54:22.454
I... I don't know.

54:22.494 --> 54:24.655
It doesn't work out, Danny.

54:24.695 --> 54:27.098
Every time you've ever had a problem,
I've been there for you

54:27.137 --> 54:28.822
but I never seen the way
or anything you want it.

54:28.857 --> 54:32.096
- I know.
- So the one time I want you do something for me

54:32.137 --> 54:34.697
you throw it at my face and tell me
must be thinking about us.

54:34.818 --> 54:35.939
Jessica, that's not what I meant.

54:36.018 --> 54:37.899
Oh, all you can see it's how it affects you.

54:38.018 --> 54:39.859
D'you even know what calls me in dreams?

54:40.818 --> 54:42.977
Used my dad odd motto.

54:45.417 --> 54:49.097
Whenever best and easy time
spent together was touring the campus.

54:49.136 --> 54:51.859
And there's a clear desire I had in me

54:51.899 --> 54:56.339
that looked in his face and I told him
that would be my odd motto, too.

54:56.379 --> 54:58.178
How I'm supposed to know that?

54:58.220 --> 55:00.338
- You never told me that.
- You never asked.

55:05.379 --> 55:07.138
I'm sorry.

55:07.178 --> 55:09.198
I'm going.

55:09.233 --> 55:11.219
I have to.

55:11.379 --> 55:13.501
Just like you to get to Willow Springs.

55:14.741 --> 55:16.340
Will you leave us?

55:16.380 --> 55:18.740
What d'you mean?

55:18.781 --> 55:21.940
I'm in.
I've always been in.

55:21.980 --> 55:24.781
I want this to work.

55:24.820 --> 55:26.341
Do you?

55:26.381 --> 55:28.820
Yeah. Of course, I do.

55:36.141 --> 55:38.141
Come on, closer.

55:38.176 --> 55:40.302
Closer.

55:40.503 --> 55:41.942
Close to the forehead?

55:41.982 --> 55:43.342
That's what I'm talking about.

55:58.264 --> 56:00.264
No, no way.
No way.

56:00.303 --> 56:01.742
That's alright.

56:01.782 --> 56:04.024
- Alright, see you then.
- Alright.

56:10.343 --> 56:12.744
Gets by 4/10.

56:14.506 --> 56:16.306
What?

56:16.345 --> 56:19.785
I like it, Danny.
But I came here to win.

56:35.826 --> 56:37.826
Now they're too fast, Enzo.

56:43.627 --> 56:47.106
Alright. This is it.
Your final test.

56:47.145 --> 56:48.786
Ten lapses, wheel to wheel race.

56:48.946 --> 56:52.949
The top 2 drivers will be shaking hand
with the World Racing team.

56:52.984 --> 56:54.507
The starting position's been determined

56:54.547 --> 56:56.707
by your individual lapse time.

56:56.907 --> 56:59.028
I expect it's a very competitive race.

56:59.068 --> 57:02.949
Since the top 5 times, you're all
within a second to each other.

57:15.269 --> 57:17.711
So missing things out there?

57:17.750 --> 57:20.190
No, no. Not so much anymore.

57:22.308 --> 57:23.829
Maybe we'll have another day.

57:26.189 --> 57:28.670
- Hey, old man.
- Hey, Jimmy.

57:30.589 --> 57:32.190
Can you believe that,
our boys are working together.

57:32.230 --> 57:34.031
- Who'd thought that?
- Hell, no.

57:34.190 --> 57:35.870
We just talked about that all the way over.

57:35.911 --> 57:37.511
Let me park this piece and we'll find 'em.

57:37.552 --> 57:38.711
Great.

57:39.910 --> 57:41.791
- Great.
- You know him?

57:41.831 --> 57:43.551
Who? Me?

57:45.631 --> 57:48.472
Remember, don't rush overtake.

57:48.591 --> 57:50.233
Look for when the other guys
make mistake.

57:50.273 --> 57:51.593
Soon as you're ahead,

57:51.632 --> 57:54.792
most important thing is drive your car.

57:54.833 --> 57:59.591
Soon as you start thinking too much
about the guy behind you, it's over.

57:59.832 --> 58:01.391
Okay?

58:01.431 --> 58:02.991
Yes, sir!

58:11.674 --> 58:12.955
You okay?

58:17.393 --> 58:19.753
Wasn't sure ever see you on the track again.

58:20.953 --> 58:22.913
Take your mask.

58:25.073 --> 58:26.953
Non farmi imbarazzo

58:29.756 --> 58:30.956
Buona fortuna, ragazzi

58:34.556 --> 58:36.795
- How's your feeling?
- I'm good.

58:36.836 --> 58:40.195
I don't want a jinx or anything,
but if I can sign on with World Racing Sports

58:40.230 --> 58:42.634
I'll be visiting your first class
in Columbia anytime I want.

58:48.676 --> 58:51.755
Hey! You're ready to do this?

58:51.794 --> 58:53.316
- Let's do it, baby.
- Good.

58:53.356 --> 58:56.717
Remember. You take your lead
and I'll get your back, okay?

58:56.876 --> 58:58.717
Won't be the first time.

58:58.757 --> 59:00.277
Krueger!

59:02.276 --> 59:04.038
I was wondering when our paths
will cross again?

59:04.077 --> 59:06.438
Mr. Afshar.
What brings you here today, sir?

59:06.478 --> 59:08.838
I come every year. It's good to count it.

59:08.878 --> 59:10.597
Good luck, Krueger.

59:13.558 --> 59:15.236
- Wasn't that the...
- My former sponsor.

59:15.397 --> 59:16.758
Right!

59:16.798 --> 59:18.717
The guy whose the car you crashed.

59:21.118 --> 59:22.159
Sorry.

59:22.199 --> 59:23.958
Drivers, come to start line.

59:42.561 --> 59:45.520
I think they may have real shots on it.

01:00:18.203 --> 01:00:19.883
Take the inside and I'll take the outside.

01:00:19.922 --> 01:00:21.962
There's no way you can block us both.

01:00:32.724 --> 01:00:34.163
Shit!

01:00:56.226 --> 01:00:57.885
You aren't, I'm not letting by.

01:01:02.926 --> 01:01:05.525
Kendal overtook that bambina.
He's on my ass.

01:01:05.725 --> 01:01:07.366
- Where's Krueger?
- Behind us.

01:01:07.401 --> 01:01:10.446
Let him by.
Let's have some fun.

01:01:26.808 --> 01:01:28.048
That's my boy.

01:01:28.207 --> 01:01:30.689
Mario's down.
Luigi's next.

01:01:30.808 --> 01:01:33.368
Yeah, I saw it.
It's little too easy so watch your back.

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:44.816
Jesus! He's bobbing me.

01:01:44.851 --> 01:01:47.649
He's just doing that to mess up
your head. Focus on Enzo.

01:02:07.932 --> 01:02:09.891
Or they got a brake test on me, man.

01:02:09.931 --> 01:02:12.531
Danny, they got me sandwiched.
Get your ass up here.

01:02:12.571 --> 01:02:15.172
Stay focused.
Don't overtake until I get there.

01:02:36.053 --> 01:02:37.093
Nice move!

01:02:44.295 --> 01:02:46.012
Hold up your position. I'm on my way.

01:02:46.973 --> 01:02:48.212
Krueger's catching me.

01:02:48.333 --> 01:02:50.013
Deal with Kendal first.

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:55.013
I've got to get out of this, man.
I'm going forwards.

01:02:55.048 --> 01:02:57.054
No, no, just wait.
I'm almost there.

01:03:02.537 --> 01:03:03.537
Now!

01:03:12.615 --> 01:03:14.335
- What just happened?
- My God!

01:03:32.898 --> 01:03:34.897
- Thank you, sir. Thank you!
- Yeah!

01:03:36.497 --> 01:03:37.497
I told you to wait.

01:03:39.698 --> 01:03:41.897
- I was right behind you.
- Danny.

01:03:43.297 --> 01:03:46.418
And tried to pass them on turn 4?

01:03:46.458 --> 01:03:47.657
Danny.

01:03:47.778 --> 01:03:50.978
I had your back, man.
Why didn't you just listen?

01:03:51.098 --> 01:03:52.738
Come on, Danny.
Stop!

01:03:52.857 --> 01:03:55.619
I bet everything I had on this, Jess.

01:03:55.659 --> 01:03:57.259
He's got the money to come back.
We don't.

01:03:57.299 --> 01:03:58.697
Frank! You'd better get over your boy.

01:03:58.859 --> 01:03:59.859
Alright!

01:03:59.898 --> 01:04:01.659
Come on, kid. I know.
Walk it off.

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:03.141
Walk! Come on.

01:04:04.180 --> 01:04:06.258
Alright. Let's forget this.

01:04:06.299 --> 01:04:09.098
It's in the eye of the storm.
We have to wait it out.

01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:13.826
- How're you doing?
- It's OK.

01:04:13.861 --> 01:04:15.978
Just taking some medicine measures.
Just be safe.

01:04:30.062 --> 01:04:32.541
- It's okay.
- No.

01:04:32.581 --> 01:04:36.340
- No, it's not.
- It's just a bump on the road.

01:04:36.380 --> 01:04:38.222
- We get to pass it.
- How?

01:04:39.622 --> 01:04:41.622
We'll figure it out.

01:05:10.543 --> 01:05:12.823
You did good out there.

01:05:12.862 --> 01:05:14.985
I'm able to get to race together
again soon.

01:05:55.026 --> 01:05:56.828
How d'you feel on today, kid?

01:05:57.028 --> 01:05:59.228
Same as yesterday and the day before that.

01:05:59.429 --> 01:06:02.387
And reminding me that you have
to claim about it again?

01:06:07.588 --> 01:06:10.868
You walked away from a crash
with the whole life ahead of you.

01:06:10.908 --> 01:06:14.109
The world that day you may want
to jump in, do it.

01:06:14.149 --> 01:06:15.870
It's only Bradford, that's all I can see.

01:06:18.510 --> 01:06:20.269
Didn't you see it?

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.068
Well.

01:06:22.910 --> 01:06:24.870
Tell you what.

01:06:24.909 --> 01:06:30.070
When you're done with all your pissing and
moaner, let's give me some help around here.

01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:33.710
I don't get it.

01:06:33.749 --> 01:06:37.392
We were team, you know?
What d'you think happened out there?

01:06:38.431 --> 01:06:39.793
Talk to him about it.

01:06:41.472 --> 01:06:42.950
Why?

01:06:42.990 --> 01:06:45.232
This doesn't matter I'm in here, am I right?

01:06:45.392 --> 01:06:48.591
But Jake is the only one who seems
to have an answer you're after.

01:06:48.631 --> 01:06:52.251
And your attitude is beginning
to get on my nerves.

01:06:53.086 --> 01:06:55.072
Somebody has a bad day?

01:06:57.431 --> 01:07:03.113
No, son. This doesn't figures in
my top 50 years bad days.

01:07:03.153 --> 01:07:04.393
And it won't be for you, either.

01:07:04.433 --> 01:07:07.513
- Yeah, right.
- You wanna know what a bad day is?

01:07:07.553 --> 01:07:10.593
The day your car hit the wall
at 150 miles/hour,

01:07:10.712 --> 01:07:12.394
that's a bad day.

01:07:12.434 --> 01:07:14.714
When your career you sweat 'n blood for

01:07:14.754 --> 01:07:17.593
get shattered like your clutch-like,
that's a bad day.

01:07:17.634 --> 01:07:19.712
The day your wife leaves with your son

01:07:19.752 --> 01:07:21.994
and the only thing keeping you
accompanied is a fifth of vodka,

01:07:22.033 --> 01:07:24.394
Those are bad days, son!

01:07:24.594 --> 01:07:28.315
It's just a walk in a park.

01:07:29.516 --> 01:07:31.515
So just listen.

01:07:31.715 --> 01:07:33.315
I want you...

01:07:34.555 --> 01:07:38.556
to change your diaper and get to work.

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:41.755
Okay? You're gonna be alright.

01:07:42.716 --> 01:07:44.555
Okay?

01:07:58.837 --> 01:08:00.998
Looks like you've got a visitor.

01:08:05.476 --> 01:08:06.997
Run this right for Fernando, alright?

01:08:11.636 --> 01:08:14.438
Ah, what's up, Krueger?

01:08:14.559 --> 01:08:16.238
Oh, just in the neighborhood

01:08:16.277 --> 01:08:18.279
just wanna see how you're doing.

01:08:19.917 --> 01:08:23.560
I'm alright.
This should be often by a week.

01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:29.359
So you're working here full time now, or...

01:08:29.518 --> 01:08:31.077
Yeah.

01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:37.359
Oh, look. I...

01:08:38.399 --> 01:08:42.720
I need to apologize for the way
the things we've done off track.

01:08:47.158 --> 01:08:50.358
All that's a lie.
I'm sorry.

01:08:50.398 --> 01:08:52.520
You've nothing to apologize for.

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:56.961
What happened out there?

01:08:57.000 --> 01:08:58.041
I don't know. I...

01:08:58.080 --> 01:09:00.562
I shoot up.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.560
I should've listened to you.

01:09:06.921 --> 01:09:08.680
Hey, what's done is done.

01:09:13.723 --> 01:09:15.323
I will see you around.

01:09:21.403 --> 01:09:23.402
Danny.

01:09:23.522 --> 01:09:25.002
Wait up.

01:09:28.604 --> 01:09:31.484
Look, something's been outfitted me
since my crash last year.

01:09:32.604 --> 01:09:34.203
I kept tellin' myself to figure it better

01:09:34.283 --> 01:09:36.684
that all I need to do is to get back
on the track.

01:09:38.285 --> 01:09:42.962
Every times I tried to push my car
to the limit, I freeze.

01:09:44.283 --> 01:09:47.524
This cold panic, it grabbed me
and I can't shake it.

01:09:47.564 --> 01:09:48.965
It's a lot, you know.

01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:51.045
Oh, come on. You're not the first one.

01:09:51.085 --> 01:09:52.966
- It'll not come back for you.
- No.

01:09:53.086 --> 01:09:55.566
A driver afraid of speed
is like a fish afraid of water.

01:09:55.607 --> 01:09:56.767
It doesn't work.

01:09:58.726 --> 01:10:01.086
Your partner should be honest with you.

01:10:03.205 --> 01:10:05.206
I'm sorry.

01:10:16.487 --> 01:10:19.087
I spotted the Krueger cake came here by.
Is he bursting your balls again?

01:10:19.126 --> 01:10:20.926
No, he came to apologize.

01:10:20.966 --> 01:10:22.727
Good. He's out of that line.

01:10:22.767 --> 01:10:24.447
- No, he wasn't.
- Yeah, of course you were.

01:10:24.487 --> 01:10:26.928
Blaming you is bull shit.

01:10:27.087 --> 01:10:29.488
It's my fault, dad.
I panicked.

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:34.807
What d'you mean?

01:10:36.447 --> 01:10:38.246
So you was out of control?

01:10:38.287 --> 01:10:40.689
Yeah, I thought so, too.

01:10:41.849 --> 01:10:45.849
Okay, there's a little bit, having said that.
It happens.

01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:48.051
You should get back out there
and that's only way to be over it.

01:10:48.084 --> 01:10:50.091
I tried, Dad. And you saw that happened.

01:10:50.210 --> 01:10:51.850
Then try harder, damn it.

01:10:51.891 --> 01:10:53.850
And so wouldn't be enough to afford it.
It never be.

01:10:53.890 --> 01:10:56.569
I gotta be smarter, I gotta be fast,
I gotta be tougher.

01:10:56.649 --> 01:10:57.889
There's always one more thing with you.

01:10:57.929 --> 01:10:59.769
What're you talking about?

01:10:59.809 --> 01:11:02.729
You wanted this since you're 6 years old.
You remember the yellow go-kart?

01:11:02.769 --> 01:11:04.369
We couldn't get you out of it.

01:11:04.409 --> 01:11:05.932
Just gonna piss it away and give up?

01:11:05.971 --> 01:11:07.651
I'm not givin' up.

01:11:10.173 --> 01:11:12.332
But I have to do with my way.

01:11:19.931 --> 01:11:21.411
What d'you think?

01:11:29.772 --> 01:11:30.932
Hey!

01:11:31.132 --> 01:11:33.293
You hungry? I bought lunch.

01:11:35.854 --> 01:11:37.613
You know these extra hours

01:11:37.653 --> 01:11:40.133
might have enough money save up for ticket.

01:11:40.173 --> 01:11:41.613
For what?

01:11:41.652 --> 01:11:43.332
Come up there about a week,

01:11:43.372 --> 01:11:44.933
having moved in your dom.

01:11:45.093 --> 01:11:46.853
Never been in New York.

01:11:48.692 --> 01:11:50.172
Look, I'm an excellent tour guide.

01:11:50.174 --> 01:11:51.653
Oh yeah?

01:11:52.694 --> 01:11:55.894
That sounds just like Jake's Mustang.

01:12:04.814 --> 01:12:07.535
So, this is where magic happens, huh?

01:12:07.576 --> 01:12:10.294
What d'you do in this side of town?

01:12:11.374 --> 01:12:12.976
I just want you to be the first to know.

01:12:14.454 --> 01:12:16.975
My dad and I has formed
our own racing team.

01:12:18.296 --> 01:12:19.776
We're going to enter Lucas Oil's Cup.

01:12:21.496 --> 01:12:23.256
That's awesome.

01:12:24.174 --> 01:12:26.416
Decided to give it another shot, huh?

01:12:26.456 --> 01:12:28.856
No. You are.

01:12:31.138 --> 01:12:32.297
What d'you mean?

01:12:32.338 --> 01:12:35.176
I want you to drive first, Danny.

01:12:38.977 --> 01:12:40.737
Are you serious?

01:12:41.938 --> 01:12:44.258
You're the better driver than me.
Just say yes.

01:12:46.259 --> 01:12:47.579
Oh, yeah!

01:12:49.138 --> 01:12:51.338
Now you do realize
that's made me your boss.

01:12:53.177 --> 01:12:54.499
Hey, Danny.

01:12:57.299 --> 01:12:59.259
Jake?

01:12:59.298 --> 01:13:00.459
What's goin' on?

01:13:00.499 --> 01:13:03.097
Looks like I just signed with a race team.

01:13:03.297 --> 01:13:04.779
What?

01:13:04.819 --> 01:13:08.420
By the way, we're still looking for
a head mechanic.

01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:10.061
I don’t have anything against Mustang,

01:13:10.140 --> 01:13:12.861
I'm just saying that we should probably
start with something a little lighter.

01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:14.940
You know, maybe under 3,000 pounds.

01:13:14.979 --> 01:13:16.940
Something foam,
just like the China says.

01:13:16.979 --> 01:13:18.660
Kendal's customers buy domestics

01:13:18.700 --> 01:13:20.981
then if I spend my advertising budget
on a race car

01:13:21.016 --> 01:13:22.106
it's gonna be a domestic.

01:13:22.141 --> 01:13:24.940
Guys. We're not doing anything right now.

01:13:24.980 --> 01:13:26.101
Why not?

01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:29.181
First, it's not like we have
enough time to build a race car.

01:13:29.382 --> 01:13:30.462
Oh, buy one.

01:13:30.583 --> 01:13:31.742
Second.

01:13:32.701 --> 01:13:35.501
We don't have qualifications
that needed to enter.

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.580
We need to be in 3 regional races.

01:13:46.581 --> 01:13:49.543
What if we partner with the other race team?

01:13:55.143 --> 01:13:56.782
You know this is the long shot, right?

01:13:56.817 --> 01:13:58.303
Yeah.

01:13:59.542 --> 01:14:04.305
It's an interesting proposal, Krueger,
but not one that I consider.

01:14:04.344 --> 01:14:06.665
We'll be supplying driver and crew.

01:14:06.704 --> 01:14:09.584
Yeah, you need my name,
my credence and my car.

01:14:09.625 --> 01:14:13.144
With your track record,
that can make me uncomfortable.

01:14:13.263 --> 01:14:16.063
With all the due respect, Mr. Afshar.
There're 2 types of drivers.

01:14:16.105 --> 01:14:18.505
Those who have crashed
and those who will.

01:14:18.546 --> 01:14:21.265
Yeah, and not every driver has a team

01:14:21.304 --> 01:14:24.507
race to share half of your responsibility
and pay half of expenses.

01:14:24.546 --> 01:14:27.266
Yeah, a brand-new race team
with that un-proven driver.

01:14:27.306 --> 01:14:29.625
And you haven't established
a race team with no driver.

01:14:30.705 --> 01:14:33.745
We know your drivers have been
in sideline for entire the season.

01:14:33.780 --> 01:14:35.990
Guys, I'm sorry but I decided
to cease this for now.

01:14:36.025 --> 01:14:39.786
We could win the Lucas Oil Cup
this season.

01:14:39.825 --> 01:14:41.066
And who knows,
the World Challenge series, maybe...

01:14:41.225 --> 01:14:44.027
I like your confidence. I do.

01:14:44.147 --> 01:14:45.787
Too risky.

01:14:45.828 --> 01:14:46.667
During that race,

01:14:46.827 --> 01:14:50.826
Danny broke student's lapse record
that held for 10 years.

01:14:51.987 --> 01:14:54.267
You're not gonna find a better driver.

01:14:56.707 --> 01:14:58.827
Sort I heard.

01:14:58.867 --> 01:15:02.186
But that was before the tour you
crashed into each other, right?

01:15:03.669 --> 01:15:04.669
Yeah.

01:15:27.749 --> 01:15:30.909
What d'you say, boys?
You're ready to see your new car?

01:15:34.709 --> 01:15:36.711
Pep Boy is one of my biggest sponsors.

01:15:36.911 --> 01:15:38.151
We have the full support.

01:15:38.271 --> 01:15:40.909
- Mark is here to help out.
- That's right, anything you need.

01:15:44.311 --> 01:15:45.872
Hey, Franco. You might help us now.

01:15:45.912 --> 01:15:47.271
Yeap.

01:16:05.473 --> 01:16:08.152
This thing is sweet!

01:16:08.273 --> 01:16:09.874
- I'm jealous.
- Why?

01:16:09.913 --> 01:16:11.473
The way you admire the car.

01:16:11.634 --> 01:16:13.033
It reminds me of you.

01:16:13.073 --> 01:16:15.833
- At least, this's rear low drive.
- Ready to run?

01:16:15.872 --> 01:16:18.313
Yeah, just a few more installations
and some tooling,

01:16:18.348 --> 01:16:19.833
then it'll be ready to race.

01:16:19.913 --> 01:16:22.315
- We have a deal?
- Yeah! Yeah, we have a deal.

01:16:23.994 --> 01:16:25.633
Welcome to the team.

01:16:29.996 --> 01:16:33.755
This car is great base.
We got a lot more out of it.

01:16:33.915 --> 01:16:35.193
You know, few tricks.

01:16:35.393 --> 01:16:37.954
We got 5 days. So let's move.

01:16:54.075 --> 01:16:56.035
Alright.

01:16:56.076 --> 01:16:57.277
Switch out the header,

01:16:57.316 --> 01:16:59.517
replace the exhaust with 3 inch.

01:16:59.677 --> 01:17:01.477
Twisted expansion.

01:17:05.197 --> 01:17:07.197
This sucker's gonna fly!

01:17:11.637 --> 01:17:14.097
- I always want my own team, Frank.
- Same.

01:17:14.132 --> 01:17:16.558
How I imagined it,
but never interested me.

01:17:16.597 --> 01:17:18.798
Preacher's looking for a choir, my friend.

01:17:18.957 --> 01:17:22.278
We'll have a big day tomorrow.
Let's settle it.

01:17:32.198 --> 01:17:34.638
Hello everybody and welcome to
the Willow Spring's raceway.

01:17:34.678 --> 01:17:36.923
for the annual Lucas Oil's cup

01:17:36.958 --> 01:17:40.119
20 of this year's top talents
will sough the asphalt

01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.200
in what will be the battle for racing glory

01:17:43.239 --> 01:17:46.040
So buckles and get ready
for some left and right turns

01:17:46.081 --> 01:17:50.160
at full throttle, here,
at Willow Spring's raceway.

01:18:02.562 --> 01:18:04.921
So Eric, how do you think
you're gonna do out there today?

01:18:05.162 --> 01:18:09.201
Come one, they should just
give us the Lucas Oil's cup
and save everyone from the hassle.

01:18:09.236 --> 01:18:11.961
Our Whelen-Callaway come here
to dominate this race.

01:18:11.996 --> 01:18:14.481
You heard it here, right on MAV TV.

01:18:28.563 --> 01:18:30.443
Enzo.

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:33.343
Ciao, bambina!

01:18:43.904 --> 01:18:45.885
Tranquilo, huh.

01:18:51.045 --> 01:18:55.046
Paulo, Enzo, say hello to Chris Rado,
World Racing.

01:18:55.086 --> 01:18:56.805
- Nice to meet you, sir!
- How are you?

01:18:56.845 --> 01:18:58.606
- Hey.
- Their farther, Giancarlo.

01:18:58.645 --> 01:19:00.125
- Gusto.
- How are you, sir?

01:19:00.165 --> 01:19:01.566
We're big fans.
You're very good racer!

01:19:01.605 --> 01:19:02.685
Thank you very much.

01:19:02.725 --> 01:19:04.745
All teams get on supplies.

01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:06.766
Brought to you by Mishimoto and Ferrera.

01:19:12.046 --> 01:19:13.567
Well?

01:19:15.007 --> 01:19:16.408
You'd better win.

01:19:19.607 --> 01:19:21.807
Qualification starts in 5 minutes.

01:19:21.842 --> 01:19:23.607
- Are you ready?
- I don't know.

01:19:23.642 --> 01:19:25.926
Let's go.

01:19:31.887 --> 01:19:34.328
Alrighty. Learn your car
so that you can get it out in,

01:19:34.448 --> 01:19:35.648
don't worry about your lapse times

01:19:35.649 --> 01:19:38.129
It seems we used to crash
on turn 4, right?

01:19:38.488 --> 01:19:41.689
I look much better
when I use a seat out here.

01:19:41.729 --> 01:19:43.288
Go, Danny!

01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:54.408
Take it smooth.
Give a few flap clutch.

01:19:57.009 --> 01:19:58.330
This dude's pretty good, Kendal.

01:20:00.971 --> 01:20:04.130
Neutral twirls slipper.
Pushes the tires up.

01:20:04.170 --> 01:20:06.651
This Darling moves over-steered.

01:20:10.412 --> 01:20:13.729
Overall, man.
We've got one great race car.

01:20:20.530 --> 01:20:23.492
- 8th place.
- Better than I expected.

01:20:24.412 --> 01:20:27.012
Hey, what d'you know
about Robert Thorne?

01:20:27.052 --> 01:20:29.611
He's great on this.

01:20:29.811 --> 01:20:31.092
Really heard about.

01:20:31.132 --> 01:20:33.170
Back from the death.

01:20:33.210 --> 01:20:35.173
- Team America.
- Amazing.

01:20:35.213 --> 01:20:39.894
Tonto, Kemosabe, don't forget
to feed your horse. Just in case.

01:20:40.772 --> 01:20:45.092
Want to dance?

01:20:50.054 --> 01:20:53.293
Take it easy, tough guy.

01:20:58.454 --> 01:21:00.256
Remember, race your race.

01:21:00.296 --> 01:21:01.855
It's for us.

01:21:08.174 --> 01:21:10.175
Drivers, ensure your tires.

01:21:11.774 --> 01:21:14.456
You can catch all the actions wide
on MAV TV.

01:21:14.496 --> 01:21:16.015
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:21:16.176 --> 01:21:17.335
How're you doin'?

01:21:17.375 --> 01:21:20.696
I think about to send
a couple meatballs back to Italy.

01:21:21.855 --> 01:21:24.095
And now we have a special guest here

01:21:24.134 --> 01:21:25.855
the speakable famous word in racing.

01:21:25.895 --> 01:21:27.776
Please give an warm welcome to

01:21:27.856 --> 01:21:29.776
Mr. Richard Gunn, from Lucas Oil.

01:21:32.655 --> 01:21:35.857
Gentlemen.
Start your engine!

01:21:38.578 --> 01:21:39.858
This is it, buddy.

01:22:15.340 --> 01:22:17.658
K-Pax, Robert Thorne leads the pack.

01:22:17.699 --> 01:22:21.700
World Racing, Enzo and Paulo Lauricello,
hard on his tail.

01:22:21.741 --> 01:22:23.860
And being back, we have Eric Curran

01:22:24.100 --> 01:22:25.822
and his teammate Leopoldo Arroyo

01:22:25.862 --> 01:22:27.660
in the Whelen-Callaway of Camaros.

01:22:27.701 --> 01:22:30.101
On the tail is Christian Rado
of XF Wing Scion.

01:22:30.141 --> 01:22:31.742
Thorne drifted through slippery turn 5.

01:22:31.901 --> 01:22:34.142
He's clearly feeling confident out there.

01:22:35.221 --> 01:22:38.261
As they come around for lapse 2,
Thorne is setting up a brisking pace.

01:22:41.060 --> 01:22:42.141
20 lapses to go,

01:22:42.181 --> 01:22:43.861
let tires warm up a little.

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:47.342
Or you'll end up like that guy.

01:22:54.662 --> 01:22:56.663
OK, Paulo. Let's get him.

01:23:00.984 --> 01:23:04.342
World Racing is catching up
using grafting to their avenger.

01:23:13.984 --> 01:23:16.345
- I got you.
- Damn it.

01:23:18.385 --> 01:23:19.906
Paulo, I'm gonna throw him down.

01:23:19.946 --> 01:23:21.944
- When I do, pass him.
- Okay.

01:23:23.945 --> 01:23:25.306
Now!

01:23:30.865 --> 01:23:33.065
World Racing's cars are now leading the race.

01:23:33.106 --> 01:23:35.266
Thorne's never been overtaken so quickly.

01:23:35.305 --> 01:23:37.665
Keep this up, you'll be a slam dunk

01:23:37.705 --> 01:23:39.746
Italians are on the move.
Get your ass up there.

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:40.826
I'm on it.

01:23:40.906 --> 01:23:42.628
And No. 77, Danny Krueger

01:23:42.667 --> 01:23:46.387
is crawling his way up the pack.
by passing David Gallagher in the outside.

01:23:51.187 --> 01:23:54.428
Kendall's driver, Danny Krueger
is really moving up the field.

01:23:54.468 --> 01:23:56.308
And now he's going after
an Evo Sport, Mercedes

01:23:56.427 --> 01:23:59.228
It looks like Krueger has that
little superior one Ford Boost,

01:23:59.267 --> 01:24:01.387
as he's powered by!

01:24:04.987 --> 01:24:06.146
Hey, the 2nd K-Pax car

01:24:06.187 --> 01:24:08.548
- brakes early in turn 7.
- Yeah, I noted that.

01:24:08.588 --> 01:24:10.989
I'll give a try to pass him there.

01:24:14.269 --> 01:24:15.509
Nice, man. Keep it up!

01:24:15.629 --> 01:24:17.069
You're all mine, Throne.

01:24:41.550 --> 01:24:42.550
Ah!

01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:45.590
This is Baja 1000.
They telegraph on your move.

01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:47.590
You've gotta back off a little
so they'll forget about you.

01:24:47.630 --> 01:24:49.151
Alright, but he's going down.

01:24:51.512 --> 01:24:52.511
Why he isn't getting a black flag?

01:24:52.546 --> 01:24:54.032
As long as it doesn't look too deliberate.

01:24:54.112 --> 01:24:55.712
- Looked too deliberate to me.
- That's the game you play.

01:24:55.872 --> 01:24:57.392
- That's race.
- Yeah.

01:24:57.431 --> 01:24:58.911
- You raced.
- You remember.

01:25:02.472 --> 01:25:03.832
There're 10 lapses to go.

01:25:03.992 --> 01:25:07.592
World Racing has been dominating
the first half of this race.

01:25:09.993 --> 01:25:11.474
Remember me?

01:25:15.313 --> 01:25:17.633
Danny Krueger is once again
in 4th position,

01:25:17.792 --> 01:25:19.393
and he's going after Robert Thorne.

01:25:19.472 --> 01:25:20.994
Alright, I'm going forwards.

01:25:23.633 --> 01:25:26.673
Krueger is on the attack.
But Thorne isn't gonna let by easily.

01:25:27.834 --> 01:25:30.676
Looks like Thorne clipped
that gap too hard.

01:25:31.875 --> 01:25:33.995
Robert Thorne is out of the race.

01:25:34.156 --> 01:25:36.594
It looks like he's got a flat tire.

01:25:36.674 --> 01:25:37.434
Kama sucks!

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:39.875
This put team Kendal in the 3rd place.

01:25:39.915 --> 01:25:41.995
Danny Krueger is really moved up the field.

01:25:42.154 --> 01:25:45.155
He's about to go head to head
with top of the World Racing cars.

01:25:45.194 --> 01:25:47.997
8 lapses to go and it has been
an exciting race so far.

01:25:48.156 --> 01:25:49.756
Alright, man. This is it.

01:25:49.916 --> 01:25:52.436
You can keep pass Paulo,
keep a press on Enzo.

01:25:52.557 --> 01:25:54.155
You'll kill their tires.
Try to stay ahead.

01:25:54.315 --> 01:25:55.555
Copy that.

01:25:57.155 --> 01:25:58.956
Krueger is truly behind you?

01:25:58.996 --> 01:26:00.756
Yeah, he's coming up fast.

01:26:00.797 --> 01:26:02.796
Then let's loosen.

01:26:21.716 --> 01:26:23.638
Do not loosen him, Enzo.

01:26:25.198 --> 01:26:26.798
Only 4 more lapses.

01:26:28.139 --> 01:26:29.839
- Take him out.
- We have time.

01:26:29.878 --> 01:26:31.839
Our tires could not last.
Take him out!

01:26:31.879 --> 01:26:33.159
<i>Che, saro squalificato!</i>

01:26:33.200 --> 01:26:34.440
<i>La squadra vincerà</i>

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:47.480
What the hell is that?

01:26:47.599 --> 01:26:48.599
So they roam me off the track!

01:26:48.639 --> 01:26:51.761
Oh, so aggressive!
Driving from Paulo Lauricello.

01:26:55.881 --> 01:26:58.001
Paulo, what happened?

01:26:58.036 --> 01:27:00.122
Fuck! Crankcase is blown off.

01:27:00.161 --> 01:27:02.281
Paulo Lauricello's gone off track.

01:27:02.320 --> 01:27:04.120
It looks like he's out.

01:27:04.161 --> 01:27:05.881
It's better we worth it, Enzo.

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:09.361
Three lapses, all is down to
Enzo Lauricello and Danny Krueger.

01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:10.520
Come on, Enzo.

01:27:15.201 --> 01:27:17.922
Alright, Enzo.
Let's see what you got.

01:27:32.123 --> 01:27:33.643
Just 2 more lapses!

01:27:33.724 --> 01:27:35.244
Enzo Lauricello and Danny Krueger

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:37.643
have really broken away
from the rest of the pack.

01:27:45.443 --> 01:27:46.685
You see it coming every time,

01:27:46.705 --> 01:27:48.845
You know the best part to overtake.

01:27:48.886 --> 01:27:50.485
I wanna pass him on 5.

01:27:50.525 --> 01:27:53.205
Be careful, man.
That's the dangerous one.

01:27:57.766 --> 01:27:59.364
Here we go!

01:28:01.364 --> 01:28:02.883
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:28:02.924 --> 01:28:05.045
- That's wow!
- That's right.

01:28:12.405 --> 01:28:17.246
Enzo, keep yourself focused.
Let's do that thing. I can't be talked.

01:28:17.366 --> 01:28:19.486
Papa, the tires are almost worn out.

01:28:19.526 --> 01:28:21.605
Pass him! You pass him now!

01:28:29.127 --> 01:28:30.328
Come on, boys. Your last lapse.

01:28:30.408 --> 01:28:31.408
It's gonna be no more.

01:28:52.929 --> 01:28:54.850
Oh! My...

01:29:05.491 --> 01:29:07.292
<i>Enzo, stai bene?</i>

01:29:07.331 --> 01:29:10.411
- I'm... I'm okay.
- He's okay.

01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:13.050
It's just blown out. He's fine.

01:29:18.569 --> 01:29:22.132
And it's a win for Denny Krueger
and team Kendal.

01:29:24.413 --> 01:29:26.132
Danny...

01:29:29.490 --> 01:29:31.051
Yes!

01:29:36.691 --> 01:29:37.771
You did it, man.

01:29:37.851 --> 01:29:41.013
Yeah! Yeah!

01:29:42.414 --> 01:29:46.734
It is a pleasure that I declare
Denny Krueger of Kendall Performance

01:29:46.769 --> 01:29:49.492
is the winner of this year's Lucas Oil cup.

01:29:50.693 --> 01:29:52.534
Thank you!

01:29:54.334 --> 01:29:57.893
On behalf of Forrest and Charlotte Lucas
and the entire Lucas Oil family,

01:29:57.934 --> 01:29:59.894
It's my honor to hand you the Lucas Oil cup.

01:29:59.933 --> 01:30:01.934
Thank you, sir!

01:30:09.933 --> 01:30:11.934
This caused by...

01:30:24.833 --> 01:30:26.634
Sorry, my friend.

01:30:42.258 --> 01:30:44.657
Get up here. Come on.

01:30:52.976 --> 01:30:54.979
- We did it, Pops.
- Proud of you, son.

01:30:55.019 --> 01:30:56.459
Thanks, Dad.

01:31:00.579 --> 01:31:02.419
What d'you say, boys? You'll use full-time.

01:31:02.458 --> 01:31:04.780
Next race is in the Laguna Seca.

01:31:04.819 --> 01:31:06.020
Are we doin' this?

01:31:06.179 --> 01:31:08.180
Yeah!

01:31:08.299 --> 01:31:10.180
Alright!

01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.800
