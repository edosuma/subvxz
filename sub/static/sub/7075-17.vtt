WEBVTT

00:01.129 --> 00:02.328
So I go into the bathroom with Tom...

00:03.329 --> 00:06.629
And we both, you know... take 'em out.

00:06.736 --> 00:10.593
And I say, "Size more? Try size less."

00:12.406 --> 00:13.759
- Wow.
- Wow.

00:13.798 --> 00:16.524
I wanna go to rehab and compare
penises with famous people.

00:16.525 --> 00:18.108
All in good time, kiddo.

00:18.109 --> 00:21.672
Well, uh, Pierce, we're very glad
to have you back.

00:21.673 --> 00:23.430
I'm assuming. You?

00:24.479 --> 00:26.585
So...What should we do now?

00:29.299 --> 00:30.609
Well, I don't wanna be that guy,

00:30.610 --> 00:33.474
but I guess we should start studying
Anthropology.

00:33.908 --> 00:34.999
Okay.

00:35.677 --> 00:38.075
Okay. Um...

00:39.674 --> 00:41.861
Chapter four.

00:43.405 --> 00:44.965
- Hello!
- Oh, thank God!

00:44.966 --> 00:46.213
Yes!

00:46.214 --> 00:47.437
Oh, my God.

00:48.121 --> 00:49.590
- Thank you.
- What is it, dean?

00:49.591 --> 00:52.095
Oh, haha. I have exciting news.

00:52.096 --> 00:53.861
Vice president Joe Biden

00:53.862 --> 00:56.542
has been visiting community colleges
across the country

00:56.543 --> 00:59.943
as part of his
"Biden Time Talkin' 'Bout Teachin'" tour.

00:59.944 --> 01:01.909
Mm, folksy, yet progressive.

01:01.910 --> 01:03.207
He does walk that line.

01:03.208 --> 01:06.267
Anyway, his tour is taking him
to this neck of the woods,

01:06.268 --> 01:09.524
And at 5:00 P.M. today,
he is stopping by Greendale!

01:10.156 --> 01:11.798
Eat that, city college and wash it down

01:11.799 --> 01:13.769
with a nice tall glass of suck it.

01:13.835 --> 01:15.316
The vice president is coming.

01:15.760 --> 01:17.006
That explains the people I've noticed

01:17.007 --> 01:18.805
covertly surveilling 
the campus this week.

01:18.806 --> 01:19.930
Must be Secret Service.

01:19.931 --> 01:22.355
Oh, Abed, will your reality ever
come out on Blu-Ray

01:22.356 --> 01:24.651
- so we can enjoy it?
- We've been made.

01:24.677 --> 01:27.510
Only problem: Mr. Biden is supposed
to be meeting

01:27.511 --> 01:28.865
with the dean...

01:29.061 --> 01:30.748
And the head of our student government,

01:30.749 --> 01:33.079
which in its current form doesn't exist.

01:33.080 --> 01:37.132
So we have seven hours
to elect a student president.

01:37.133 --> 01:38.996
Ah, what am I gonna wear?

01:38.997 --> 01:42.439
I mean, I could borrow
my sister's Uncle Sam outfit.

01:42.912 --> 01:44.273
It's tailored for ladies

01:44.274 --> 01:47.027
but what else can I do
on such short notice?

01:47.095 --> 01:49.141
Well, you can not dress up like Uncle Sam.

01:49.471 --> 01:51.643
Or admit you don't have a sister.

01:51.644 --> 01:53.492
We're electing a student president.

01:53.493 --> 01:54.366
I wanna run!

01:54.367 --> 01:56.317
I have so many ideas
for improving the school.

01:56.318 --> 01:58.542
Improving Greendale takes more
than ideas, Annie.

01:58.543 --> 02:01.359
It takes time, gasoline, matches.

02:01.360 --> 02:02.880
Mm, nice.

02:03.327 --> 02:05.693
Well, news flash, Jeff.
Some of us care about more

02:05.694 --> 02:07.998
than just fixing our hair
and sculpting our abs.

02:07.999 --> 02:09.934
Wow. You got me pegged.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.233
Democracy. What a ruse.

02:12.234 --> 02:13.900
There's no such thing as a system in which

02:13.901 --> 02:16.881
- the masses hold any...
- Everyone wants you to shut up.

02:16.882 --> 02:19.497
And yet I won't. Case in point.

02:49.353 --> 02:52.729
We tend to take democracy
for granted in America.

02:52.730 --> 02:56.446
But the fact is men have fought and died

02:56.447 --> 03:00.280
for the sacred right we exercise today.

03:00.915 --> 03:04.032
So anyone who wants to be president,

03:04.033 --> 03:06.737
line up by the ice cream machine.

03:06.738 --> 03:09.980
Your applause will determine
who gets into the primaries.

03:09.981 --> 03:13.355
And yes, this is a ladies Uncle Sam outfit.

03:13.356 --> 03:16.033
It's my sister's. It was last-minute.

03:16.034 --> 03:17.114
I had no choice.

03:17.115 --> 03:19.307
I wonder if that's the same sister
that tweets me

03:19.308 --> 03:21.320
to ask if I think her brother's cute.

03:21.751 --> 03:22.664
Jeff, what happened to

03:22.665 --> 03:24.474
that pile of campaign fliers I gave you?

03:24.475 --> 03:25.698
I hung 'em all up.

03:28.381 --> 03:29.559
Real nice.

03:29.624 --> 03:31.344
Is it too much to ask you to pitch in?

03:31.345 --> 03:33.942
I'm sorry, Annie.
I'm not the worker bee type.

03:33.943 --> 03:36.707
I'm more of a silverback
gorilla with the claws a lion,

03:36.708 --> 03:39.366
the teeth of a shark, and the
quiet dignity of a tortoise.

03:39.367 --> 03:41.731
All right. First up is this fella.

03:41.822 --> 03:43.057
Let's go. Come on.

03:43.058 --> 03:44.474
All right, tell everybody your name.

03:44.811 --> 03:46.317
- Garrett.
- Okay, Garrett.

03:46.318 --> 03:48.227
And why do you want to be president?

03:48.228 --> 03:51.412
I wanted ice cream, so I got in line...

03:51.413 --> 03:54.449
Okay, okay. He wanted ice cream.

03:54.450 --> 03:55.763
So what do we say, gang?

03:55.764 --> 03:56.970
Does he make it to the next round?

03:56.971 --> 03:58.372
By applause.

03:58.910 --> 04:01.709
Oh! We've got our first nominee.

04:01.710 --> 04:02.971
All right, the bar has been set.

04:02.972 --> 04:05.309
All right, stand to the side.
Stand to the side.

04:05.874 --> 04:07.067
You know what?

04:07.068 --> 04:09.392
At least worker bees can
set aside their egos

04:09.393 --> 04:11.601
and join together to
support a larger cause.

04:11.602 --> 04:15.377
Oh, right, because politics
are all about larger causes.

04:15.685 --> 04:16.646
Face it, Annie.

04:16.647 --> 04:21.613
Politics are all about ego,
popularity, and parlor tricks.

04:21.613 --> 04:22.995
Don't kid a lawyer.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.736
Well, if I see one, I won't.

04:27.395 --> 04:30.179
Oh, it's a girl! Look at this.

04:30.180 --> 04:32.427
She's got a yellow shirt and a hat.

04:32.428 --> 04:33.655
Who are you, sweetie?

04:33.656 --> 04:34.784
Uh, Vicki.

04:34.785 --> 04:36.838
Who's up for some Vicki, huh?

04:37.041 --> 04:39.757
Abed Nadir, I'm special
agent Robin Vohlers.

04:39.758 --> 04:40.632
This is special agent Keenlan

04:40.633 --> 04:42.124
of the United States Secret Service.

04:42.125 --> 04:44.462
Will you submit to a search
of your personal belongings?

04:44.463 --> 04:45.518
Sure.

04:47.963 --> 04:49.717
If I may ask, how did you notice

04:49.718 --> 04:51.007
the campus was being observed?

04:51.008 --> 04:53.146
I guess I noticed because I'm
used to being the only observer.

04:53.275 --> 04:56.414
Well, we're not used to being noticed.

04:56.746 --> 04:58.169
That sounds a little sad.

05:00.328 --> 05:01.510
He's clean.

05:03.066 --> 05:04.986
Although I could issue a warning

05:04.987 --> 05:06.812
for this bootleg of The Last Airbender.

05:06.813 --> 05:08.143
Where were you a week ago?

05:11.674 --> 05:12.758
You can keep it.

05:13.539 --> 05:15.691
Well, another one makes the cut.

05:15.692 --> 05:17.222
Congratulations, Leonard.

05:17.885 --> 05:19.719
Oh, yes, wonderful.

05:19.720 --> 05:22.237
Next up, Annie Edison.

05:24.912 --> 05:26.966
My name is Annie Edison.

05:26.967 --> 05:29.769
And if elected, I promise to make Greendale

05:29.770 --> 05:33.189
the signature community college
of the entire western

05:33.190 --> 05:36.460
- 3/4 of the Greendale area.
- Annie!

05:36.461 --> 05:40.753
Oh, whoa! Looks like you're
in the running, Annie.

05:40.819 --> 05:44.297
Looks like it is hard not to be. Next up...

05:44.298 --> 05:45.892
I'm sorry. Hey, I got the heat, I gotta go.

05:46.890 --> 05:50.029
I believe that humankind
need not be governed.

05:54.648 --> 05:55.909
I don't care.

05:57.423 --> 05:59.653
Well, it's good to know there's
a floor on this thing.

05:59.654 --> 06:01.987
Thank you, miss Perry.

06:02.073 --> 06:04.852
Oh, Annie, I'm so proud of you.

06:04.853 --> 06:06.380
People love you.

06:06.381 --> 06:08.807
I believe this campus is a good place,

06:08.808 --> 06:11.104
filled with good people
who just need someone

06:11.105 --> 06:12.580
to protect their interests.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.684
Jeff Winger!

06:16.415 --> 06:19.646
My name is Jeff. I'm no politician.

06:19.647 --> 06:21.047
I'm just a fella.

06:21.257 --> 06:25.083
I think that beer should be
cold and boots should be dusty.

06:25.304 --> 06:27.289
I think 9/11 was bad.

06:27.419 --> 06:31.667
And freedom, well, I think
that's just a little bit better.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.776
Whoo! Yeah!

06:51.273 --> 06:52.301
The countdown has begun.

06:52.302 --> 06:54.240
And at 5:00 tonight, 
one student will be president

06:54.241 --> 06:55.720
while the rest will simply be.

06:55.721 --> 06:57.735
For Greendale campus TV, I'm Abed Nadir.

06:57.736 --> 07:01.258
I'm Troy "Butt Soup" Barnes.
What? That's my name.

07:01.259 --> 07:03.173
As we head into the first
round of the debates,

07:03.174 --> 07:04.678
there are eight candidates in the lead.

07:04.679 --> 07:07.450
Annie Edison... smart, attractive,
but easily vexed.

07:07.451 --> 07:09.130
- Leonard Rodriguez...
- Did he change his last name?

07:09.131 --> 07:10.458
Yeah, he's trying to
court the Hispanic vote.

07:10.459 --> 07:11.665
Alex "Starburns" Osbourne...

07:11.666 --> 07:14.338
Creepy. Seems Greek.
Possible drug dealer.

07:14.339 --> 07:15.816
- Jeff Winger.
- Crowd favorite.

07:15.817 --> 07:16.863
They call him Hot Wings.

07:16.864 --> 07:18.440
- Magnitude.
- Short for Magnetic Attitude.

07:18.441 --> 07:19.700
He's a one-man party.

07:19.701 --> 07:21.436
Pierce Hawthorne. The wizard of wet wipes.

07:21.437 --> 07:22.460
I live with that dude.

07:22.461 --> 07:24.317
He's got night terrors and a rotary phone.

07:24.318 --> 07:25.931
- Garrett.
- That guy's just a mess.

07:25.932 --> 07:27.333
It's like God spilled a person.

07:27.334 --> 07:30.374
- And Vicki.
- Yellow shirt, hat.

07:30.375 --> 07:33.573
Girl... you know, you gotta ask
yourself right now, Abed.

07:34.260 --> 07:36.839
- What's up with politics?
- Yeah, yeah.

07:36.840 --> 07:37.972
You're precisely right, Troy.

07:37.973 --> 07:39.171
You know, I hear they're
getting ready to start,

07:39.172 --> 07:41.044
so we'll turn it over to
coverage of the debates.

07:45.966 --> 07:46.925
Who's that?

07:46.926 --> 07:49.260
Special agent Vohlers.
United States Secret Service.

07:49.531 --> 07:51.906
Do you just constantly have your
own little side adventures?

07:51.907 --> 07:52.855
Yep.

07:53.640 --> 07:54.779
Me too.

07:59.495 --> 08:00.442
Hmm.

08:00.443 --> 08:02.217
Jeff, knock it off.

08:02.218 --> 08:03.458
You're not running sincerely.

08:03.459 --> 08:05.228
You're not even interested
in student government.

08:05.229 --> 08:07.151
I know, and yet, the people love me.

08:07.152 --> 08:09.585
It's almost as if politics
were a huge joke.

08:09.586 --> 08:11.463
Okay, look.

08:11.464 --> 08:13.338
I'm sorry I asked you to hang my fliers,

08:13.339 --> 08:15.340
but I suggest you drop out right now,

08:15.341 --> 08:16.676
because not only will I beat you,

08:16.677 --> 08:17.824
I will make you cry.

08:17.825 --> 08:18.790
Mmm.

08:18.954 --> 08:21.325
Oh, I feel a slight ego

08:21.326 --> 08:22.428
blowing in from the east.

08:22.429 --> 08:24.192
You're gonna feel my foot
blowing in from the south.

08:24.193 --> 08:25.365
Bring it on, Ponce de Leon.

08:25.366 --> 08:27.208
I'm gonna, Greg Muldunna.

08:28.490 --> 08:29.532
It's a real guy.

08:29.533 --> 08:30.723
He owns a mattress store downtown.

08:30.724 --> 08:31.968
You can look it up.

08:33.697 --> 08:34.904
Hey, Vicki.

08:35.024 --> 08:36.109
Psst!

08:37.758 --> 08:39.611
Vicki, look at me. Psst!

08:40.496 --> 08:42.599
- I'm going to crush you.
- Pierce!

08:42.600 --> 08:43.395
Stop that!

08:43.395 --> 08:44.801
I'm gonna eat your brains, Vicki.

08:44.835 --> 08:46.633
I'm gonna slurp 'em right out of that melon

08:46.634 --> 08:47.389
you call a head.

08:47.390 --> 08:49.139
A reminder to all candidates:

08:49.140 --> 08:51.208
Your microphones are currently on.

08:51.209 --> 08:53.429
Well, they better be,
'cause I'm on fire up here.

08:54.456 --> 08:56.435
You freak people out, you know that?

08:56.436 --> 08:57.893
You look weird...

08:58.824 --> 09:00.194
Because of your overbite.

09:00.195 --> 09:02.411
Okay, let's just get started.

09:02.412 --> 09:06.498
Welcome to the Greendale Community
College presidential debate.

09:06.713 --> 09:10.608
Candidates, if elected, what will you do?

09:10.828 --> 09:11.920
Oh, Annie?

09:11.921 --> 09:14.640
I'm running on a platform
of school improvement.

09:14.641 --> 09:16.912
If I'm elected, the black mold

09:16.913 --> 09:19.198
will be removed from the east stairwell.

09:19.199 --> 09:22.075
The assailant known only
as "the asscrack bandit"

09:22.076 --> 09:23.756
will be brought to justice.

09:23.757 --> 09:26.181
And I will balance the school's budget

09:26.182 --> 09:29.044
by eliminating administrative redundancies.

09:30.071 --> 09:31.849
Okay. I'm in the room.

09:31.850 --> 09:33.725
Thank you, miss Edison.

09:33.856 --> 09:34.824
Mr. Winger?

09:34.825 --> 09:36.589
Well, that's an important question.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.760
And it's important to students like Jeremy,

09:39.761 --> 09:42.377
who told me today that he
is majoring in Astronomy

09:42.378 --> 09:44.446
and is supporting two children.

09:44.712 --> 09:47.441
It's an important question to Maria,

09:47.442 --> 09:50.291
who's a beautiful Latina born in Nicaragua,

09:50.292 --> 09:51.941
working in the cafeteria.

09:52.041 --> 09:53.982
What will I do, dean?

09:53.983 --> 09:57.083
Well, these people don't
want me to say what I'll do.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.148
They want me to do what I'll say.

10:00.149 --> 10:01.229
Oh.

10:03.758 --> 10:05.854
They love it when you
shuffle the words around.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.611
Magnitude?

10:07.772 --> 10:08.933
Pop! Pop!

10:08.934 --> 10:10.179
Oh, no!

10:12.371 --> 10:13.594
Same question.

10:13.595 --> 10:14.809
Same answer.

10:14.858 --> 10:15.931
Pop! Pop!

10:15.932 --> 10:17.152
Oh!

10:18.987 --> 10:20.905
Mind if I ask you a few
questions, Mr. Nadir?

10:20.906 --> 10:21.859
Okay.

10:21.978 --> 10:23.029
Was there a specific reason

10:23.030 --> 10:24.646
you had to repeat the first grade?

10:24.647 --> 10:26.136
Well, from what I'm told,

10:26.137 --> 10:27.347
I didn't know how to use scissors,

10:27.348 --> 10:28.452
I sat in the middle of the seesaw,

10:28.453 --> 10:29.259
and I always found the distinction

10:29.260 --> 10:30.890
between duck and goose
to be very arbitrary.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.602
Couldn't you just pick the
sixth kid every time?

10:32.603 --> 10:33.809
That's what I...

10:34.666 --> 10:35.941
Would have done.

10:36.166 --> 10:37.555
I went with four.

10:39.726 --> 10:42.026
Geez, get a room, you two.

10:42.720 --> 10:44.853
Pierce Hawthorne, your platform?

10:44.854 --> 10:46.610
My platform will be one high enough

10:46.611 --> 10:48.600
to push Vicki off to her death.

10:48.601 --> 10:49.728
Ugh!

10:50.103 --> 10:51.371
Vicki!

10:51.383 --> 10:52.981
It looks like Vicki is out of the race.

10:52.982 --> 10:54.456
Oh, well, then I am too.

10:54.457 --> 10:55.894
I was only here to get back at her

10:55.895 --> 10:57.437
for not lending me a pencil.

10:57.501 --> 10:59.127
Okay. Wow.

10:59.532 --> 11:00.321
Uh, well...

11:00.322 --> 11:01.906
Can we get back on track here?

11:01.907 --> 11:03.946
I just want to get the black mold

11:03.947 --> 11:05.727
out of the east stairwell.

11:05.728 --> 11:09.756
I just want to clean up Greendale.

11:09.757 --> 11:11.488
Are you saying Greendale is dirty?

11:11.489 --> 11:13.553
Oh, boo.

11:13.585 --> 11:15.343
- Boo.
- Well...

11:16.088 --> 11:17.422
Of course it's dirty.

11:17.423 --> 11:18.581
Everyone knows that.

11:18.582 --> 11:19.803
I don't, Annie.

11:20.315 --> 11:21.719
I think it's clean.

11:21.829 --> 11:23.509
I think it's the cleanest school

11:23.510 --> 11:25.302
in the entire country.

11:25.485 --> 11:26.315
You know it is.

11:26.316 --> 11:27.091
Looks like Jeff Winger's really

11:27.092 --> 11:28.314
got this thing in the bag.

11:28.315 --> 11:29.247
Sure does, Troy.

11:29.248 --> 11:30.351
Say what you will about this or that,

11:30.352 --> 11:31.655
but people just like the guy.

11:32.219 --> 11:35.421
Read my lips...

11:35.953 --> 11:38.545
No matter what you're told...

11:38.733 --> 11:41.862
We have to clean the mold.

11:42.149 --> 11:44.714
No matter what you're told...

11:44.715 --> 11:47.199
We have to clean the mold!

11:47.200 --> 11:48.278
That's right, people!

11:48.279 --> 11:50.520
No matter what you're told...

11:50.521 --> 11:52.672
We have to clean the mold.

11:52.673 --> 11:53.476
- Come on.
- Yeah!

11:53.477 --> 11:55.151
Well, this is interesting.

11:55.152 --> 11:56.506
Annie Edison has reduced her platform

11:56.507 --> 11:59.163
to one issue and turned that
issue into a sound bite.

11:59.164 --> 12:02.145
And it rhymes and people love it.

12:02.285 --> 12:04.050
This election's become a real horse race.

12:04.051 --> 12:06.138
According to our polls,
the campus is almost

12:06.139 --> 12:07.142
evenly divided.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.603
Now keep in mind the margin of error

12:08.604 --> 12:09.844
on this thing is about 98%.

12:09.845 --> 12:10.583
Could be higher.

12:10.584 --> 12:11.723
We don't even know how
to do margins of error.

12:11.724 --> 12:12.883
We talked to two people
at a vending machine.

12:12.884 --> 12:14.564
Well, I'm being told we're
taking a quick break,

12:14.565 --> 12:16.054
- but stay tuned.
- They have to stay tuned.

12:16.055 --> 12:17.812
- It's closed circuit television.
- Don't know what that means.

12:17.813 --> 12:19.071
And we're out.

12:21.100 --> 12:22.452
Can I get an apple juice, please?

12:22.453 --> 12:24.827
Freshly squeezed this time
or so help me God, Maurice.

12:24.828 --> 12:26.947
Abed, those guys in the suits

12:26.948 --> 12:29.633
are trashing your dorm room real bad, bro.

12:37.860 --> 12:38.785
What are you doing?

12:38.786 --> 12:40.173
Random spot check, Mr. Nadir.

12:40.174 --> 12:41.366
Stay out of our way.

12:41.367 --> 12:42.521
Nothing suspicious.

12:42.522 --> 12:44.402
Glenn, bring the car around.

12:48.650 --> 12:49.673
What are you looking for, Robin?

12:49.674 --> 12:51.877
Fertilizer, car battery, PVC piping,

12:51.878 --> 12:52.991
anything suspicious.

12:52.992 --> 12:54.436
Because you think I'm suspicious?

12:56.362 --> 12:59.015
Or because you wish I was suspicious,

12:59.016 --> 13:00.315
so that you would have an
excuse to see more of me.

13:00.316 --> 13:01.376
This was a random spot check.

13:01.377 --> 13:03.189
- Do you like me?
- That's not really relevant.

13:05.228 --> 13:06.612
That's close enough.

13:07.273 --> 13:08.524
Are you sure?

13:09.728 --> 13:11.182
You smell like nice soap.

13:12.096 --> 13:13.316
I have to go.

13:16.432 --> 13:17.841
I'm sorry you weren't a more obvious

13:17.842 --> 13:19.684
potential threat to the country.

13:25.086 --> 13:27.981
People are pretty excited
about this black mold issue.

13:27.982 --> 13:28.736
We'll see.

13:28.737 --> 13:29.864
For my closing statement, I'm thinking

13:29.865 --> 13:31.726
about smashing a watermelon with a hammer.

13:31.727 --> 13:34.008
Jeff, if I admit politics are stupid,

13:34.009 --> 13:35.665
will you stop making them stupid?

13:35.666 --> 13:37.040
You're gonna split the vote and Starburns

13:37.041 --> 13:38.259
is gonna end up president.

13:38.260 --> 13:40.624
I'm the only one up here who's
trying to get something done.

13:40.625 --> 13:43.153
And you deserve to be allowed to do it?

13:43.228 --> 13:45.492
You're entitled to be president?

13:45.633 --> 13:47.867
The gloves are coming off.
You understand me?

13:48.089 --> 13:50.355
I have an audio-visual presentation.

13:50.356 --> 13:51.537
Wow. I'm shaking.

13:51.538 --> 13:53.400
You should be. You should be.

13:53.401 --> 13:56.059
All right, let us resume.

13:56.367 --> 13:58.840
Star-burns, we haven't heard from you

13:58.841 --> 14:00.192
on this black mold issue.

14:00.193 --> 14:02.205
Yeah, I actually withdraw my candidacy.

14:02.206 --> 14:04.745
I fear a political career will shine

14:04.746 --> 14:06.772
a negative light on my drug dealing.

14:06.773 --> 14:08.008
Thank you.

14:08.667 --> 14:11.783
Dean, before this election
stops being about the issues,

14:11.784 --> 14:14.021
I have a question for my opponents.

14:14.426 --> 14:16.051
What's your favorite color?

14:16.052 --> 14:17.767
Mine's a three-way tie.

14:17.942 --> 14:21.270
Red, white, and blue.

14:22.789 --> 14:24.542
Magnitude, a response?

14:24.543 --> 14:26.151
I think you know, dean.

14:27.033 --> 14:28.865
Pop! Pop!

14:32.963 --> 14:34.135
Oh, I set him up.

14:34.136 --> 14:36.516
I have an audio-visual presentation, dean.

14:36.517 --> 14:38.051
Oh, well, that sounds interesting.

14:38.052 --> 14:39.498
What's your presentation, Annie?

14:39.499 --> 14:41.796
My presentation is a copy of Jeff Winger's

14:41.797 --> 14:45.431
1997 audition tape for
MTV's The Real World.

14:45.432 --> 14:46.898
What? What?

14:47.044 --> 14:49.167
Let's just roll it. Thanks.

14:50.837 --> 14:52.982
Hey, I'm Jeff Winger and I'd love

14:52.983 --> 14:55.534
to be on MTV's Real World: Seattle.

Where the hell did you get that?

15:13.916 --> 15:16.763
Folks, who do you want
shaking Joe Biden's hand

15:16.764 --> 15:18.169
at 5:00 P.M.?

15:18.281 --> 15:20.482
Me or...

15:21.293 --> 15:23.579
Shut up! I was, like, 19.

15:23.580 --> 15:26.772
We've all been 19, Jeff,
and none of us did this.

15:26.903 --> 15:27.922
None of us.

15:29.932 --> 15:31.364
Pop! Pop!

15:31.973 --> 15:33.136
I hate you!

15:33.137 --> 15:34.675
I hate this school!

15:35.273 --> 15:37.924
And I hope you all get
black mold poisoning!

15:37.925 --> 15:38.839
Oh, Jeffrey, no!

15:38.840 --> 15:41.016
I hate you! I hate you! I hate you!

15:41.017 --> 15:42.526
Oh, Jeffrey, no.

15:53.807 --> 15:55.203
Are you in here?

15:56.007 --> 15:57.998
Yeah, to be alone.

15:57.999 --> 16:00.377
I've already established the
men's room doesn't work.

16:00.756 --> 16:02.205
You have an apartment.

16:02.206 --> 16:03.410
There are people in the parking lot

16:03.411 --> 16:04.808
singing that song.

16:05.508 --> 16:07.051
I went too far.

16:07.483 --> 16:08.486
I'm sorry.

16:08.487 --> 16:10.412
I didn't know it would be that bad.

16:10.551 --> 16:11.662
You knew.

16:11.663 --> 16:12.962
You didn't care.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.321
But don't apologize.

16:14.322 --> 16:16.006
I got what I deserved.

16:16.495 --> 16:19.826
I am a gross, jaded adult

16:19.827 --> 16:21.681
with control issues that couldn't let

16:21.682 --> 16:25.249
a young, bright, idealistic
kid run for president.

16:28.684 --> 16:30.730
Wait, isn't there a final round of debates?

16:31.003 --> 16:32.857
Yeah. I...

16:33.738 --> 16:34.547
You guys!

16:34.548 --> 16:35.348
You're missing it!

16:35.349 --> 16:37.086
Troy, I'm out.

16:37.092 --> 16:38.026
Me too.

16:38.027 --> 16:39.669
I withdrew my candidacy.

16:39.731 --> 16:41.397
Nobody that treats a
friend the way that I did

16:41.398 --> 16:42.961
is fit to represent the student body.

16:42.962 --> 16:44.988
Uh, yeah, I know you're both out.

16:44.989 --> 16:46.518
I'm saying you're missing it.

16:46.519 --> 16:48.787
It's the political showdown of the century.

16:48.788 --> 16:49.886
Come on.

16:49.918 --> 16:51.274
Pop! Pop!

16:52.293 --> 16:53.651
Pop! Pop!

16:54.550 --> 16:55.935
Pop! Pop!

16:56.579 --> 16:58.051
Pop! Pop!

16:58.107 --> 16:59.659
You should have stayed in the running.

16:59.660 --> 17:01.145
You're the only real candidate.

17:01.146 --> 17:04.236
No, I was just another jerk
trying to win a contest.

17:04.537 --> 17:05.905
You were right the whole time.

17:05.906 --> 17:07.588
I just couldn't admit it until I saw you

17:07.589 --> 17:09.519
running away crying.

17:09.922 --> 17:10.943
Yay.

17:10.944 --> 17:13.577
I care what you think about me, you know?

17:13.578 --> 17:16.653
Yeah, well, I care what you think about me.

17:17.193 --> 17:18.482
That's why this happened.

17:18.483 --> 17:19.920
Okay, well...

17:21.185 --> 17:22.997
Resolved, then.

17:23.709 --> 17:25.094
Resolved.

17:28.301 --> 17:30.388
When we seek to destroy others,

17:30.598 --> 17:32.562
we often hurt our self.

17:33.735 --> 17:37.268
Because it is the self that
wants to be destroyed.

17:37.586 --> 17:40.298
Pierce, you're not usually so poignant.

17:40.299 --> 17:44.133
Well, Vicki finally lent me her pencil.

17:44.134 --> 17:45.767
Oh, my God! Pierce!

17:45.768 --> 17:47.323
Go to the health center!

17:47.448 --> 17:48.743
Yeah.

17:49.875 --> 17:52.097
Well, we've finally reached
the end of election road.

17:52.098 --> 17:54.197
Arguments have been made,
pops have been popped.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.267
Hearts have been stirred, perhaps broken.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.036
The only thing that remains
is to tally the vote

17:59.037 --> 18:01.217
in this matchup between the youthful,

18:01.218 --> 18:02.954
charismatic Magnitude,

18:02.955 --> 18:04.896
and the Leonard "the Human Raisin" 
Rodriguez.

18:04.897 --> 18:06.861
Two men fighting for the
same piece of earth.

18:07.142 --> 18:09.118
One recently born. One soon to die.

18:09.119 --> 18:11.835
A competition reflecting
the pointlessness of life.

18:12.632 --> 18:14.514
Pull up, Abed. You're in a nosedive.

18:14.622 --> 18:16.600
I'm being told now that dean Pelton

18:16.601 --> 18:17.519
is prepared to announce a winner.

18:17.520 --> 18:19.454
We take you now live to across the room.

18:19.455 --> 18:22.013
Okay. Here we go.

18:22.014 --> 18:23.675
Thank you, Sergio.

18:23.758 --> 18:25.661
With 11 votes cast...

18:25.662 --> 18:27.789
11? Come on, people.

18:29.140 --> 18:32.946
The landslide winner of
the student election

18:32.947 --> 18:37.124
with seven votes is...

18:37.125 --> 18:38.556
South Park.

18:39.469 --> 18:41.326
Okay. You know what?

18:41.327 --> 18:43.382
I seem to recall this is why we abolished

18:43.383 --> 18:45.120
student government in the first place.

18:45.121 --> 18:47.911
This is exactly what
happened ten years ago.

18:48.724 --> 18:51.414
Hey, how hard is it to
get rid of black mold?

18:51.630 --> 18:53.789
What do we need, buckets and sponges?

18:54.520 --> 18:56.689
I don't actually know.

18:57.355 --> 18:58.648
We'll look it up.

18:59.974 --> 19:01.139
M'lady.

19:01.435 --> 19:02.609
Well, there you have it.

19:02.610 --> 19:04.064
In a shocking write-in upset,

19:04.065 --> 19:06.445
the Comedy Central cartoon
series South Park

19:06.446 --> 19:09.075
has been elected president of
the Greendale student body.

19:09.076 --> 19:10.950
Not that shocking to me. I voted for it.

19:11.022 --> 19:11.948
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

19:11.949 --> 19:13.392
Me too. Aww.

19:13.492 --> 19:15.171
We can never stop being friends.

19:15.562 --> 19:16.931
As the confetti gets swept away

19:16.932 --> 19:18.582
and we begin gearing up
for next year's election,

19:18.583 --> 19:20.802
for GCTV, I'm Abed Nadir saying,

19:20.803 --> 19:21.581
"Did you know you could make napalm

19:21.582 --> 19:23.453
out of common dish soap and cat food?"

19:23.908 --> 19:25.064
What?

19:25.198 --> 19:26.263
Why would you say that?

19:33.889 --> 19:35.570
- Vohlers.
- Hmm?

19:35.571 --> 19:36.553
Yeah.

19:38.481 --> 19:39.192
I'm sorry, sir.

19:39.193 --> 19:40.707
We're gonna have to move
on to city college.

19:40.708 --> 19:43.017
Apparently there's an elevated
threat level at Greendale.

19:43.186 --> 19:44.013
But don't worry.

19:44.014 --> 19:46.675
I'll check it out...Personally.

19:46.676 --> 19:47.713
Whatever.

19:50.170 --> 19:53.590
I had a dream I was the regular president.

19:59.799 --> 20:01.515
You've done so much for our city.

20:01.516 --> 20:05.418
Kickpuncher, is there anything
that we can give you?

20:06.159 --> 20:08.452
Don't call me Kickpuncher.

20:08.590 --> 20:11.114
Call me...David.

20:22.922 --> 20:24.093
This was fun.

20:25.518 --> 20:26.561
Maybe you can observe me having dinner

20:26.562 --> 20:27.965
next time you're in town.

20:28.113 --> 20:30.009
Honk twice for "yes," once for "no."

20:32.734 --> 20:36.380
Cool. Cool, cool, cool.

20:36.580 --> 20:46.780
