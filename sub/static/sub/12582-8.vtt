00:32.716 --> 00:33.876
Take your time, Bobby.

00:33.917 --> 00:35.578
You're not just
wallet shopping;

00:35.618 --> 00:37.176
you're learning
a valuable lesson

00:37.220 --> 00:38.482
in money management.

00:38.521 --> 00:40.546
Savor it.

00:44.894 --> 00:46.361
<i>This</i> one.

00:48.264 --> 00:49.959
That'll be $135.

00:49.999 --> 00:51.364
Dad, pay the man.

00:51.401 --> 00:54.165
Now, why would you pick
<i>that</i> overpriced thing,

00:54.204 --> 00:56.570
when there's
a sturdy, reasonably-priced

00:56.606 --> 00:58.301
<i>$15</i> one right in front of you?

00:58.341 --> 00:59.968
Well, this one's pretty snazzy,

01:00.009 --> 01:03.570
and it looks like
it can hold a ton of money.

01:03.613 --> 01:04.238
Bobby...

01:04.280 --> 01:05.406
That way,

01:05.447 --> 01:06.881
if I wanted to impress someone,

01:06.916 --> 01:08.850
I could pull out
a really big wad of cash.

01:08.885 --> 01:09.852
Bam!

01:09.886 --> 01:12.411
Dad, give me
a big wad of cash.

01:12.455 --> 01:15.754
What are you trying to do,
Bobby, get us mugged?

01:15.792 --> 01:18.090
Hmm!

01:18.128 --> 01:21.120
Why would you go waving your
money around in public?

01:21.164 --> 01:22.358
'Cause it's cool,

01:22.398 --> 01:24.798
and I think
it makes people like you.

01:24.834 --> 01:27.428
How much money
do you make a year, anyway?

01:27.470 --> 01:30.530
Bobby, where did you pick
up that kind of talk?

01:30.573 --> 01:32.905
I thought you <i>wanted</i>
to talk about money.

01:32.942 --> 01:36.571
I did. Quietly and without
mentioning any dollar figures.

01:36.613 --> 01:40.743
Bobby, only jackasses go around
saying how much money they make.

01:40.784 --> 01:42.547
What are you talking about?

01:42.585 --> 01:46.248
Julia Roberts makes
20 million a picture.

01:46.289 --> 01:48.814
Are you calling
America's Sweetheart a jackass?

01:48.858 --> 01:50.450
It's just vulgar, Bobby.

01:50.493 --> 01:52.586
The amount of money a man makes

01:52.629 --> 01:54.995
is between him
and the professionals

01:55.031 --> 01:56.965
down at the H & R Block.

01:57.000 --> 01:59.059
Who were we talking to

01:59.102 --> 02:01.730
in Dallas for 37 minutes?

02:01.771 --> 02:03.636
Oh, I remember.

02:04.841 --> 02:07.002
Where did I go wrong, Peggy?

02:07.043 --> 02:09.033
How did I raise a
son who goes around

02:09.078 --> 02:11.068
with that filthy
money-mouth of his?

02:11.114 --> 02:13.241
He actually had the audacity

02:13.283 --> 02:15.945
to ask me how much
I make a year.

02:15.985 --> 02:17.077
Hmm. I do not know

02:17.120 --> 02:19.213
where he would get
an attitude like that.

02:19.255 --> 02:20.813
It certainly was not from us.

02:20.857 --> 02:22.654
We raised him
to be uncomfortable

02:22.692 --> 02:24.250
about anything that personal.

02:24.294 --> 02:27.991
Dad, Ladybird's
scooting again.

02:28.998 --> 02:30.659
Oh, uh... hey, son.

02:30.700 --> 02:32.759
You guys were talking
about money, weren't you?

02:32.802 --> 02:34.235
No.

02:35.138 --> 02:36.969
Yes, you were!

02:37.006 --> 02:38.030
You were paying bills.

02:38.074 --> 02:39.302
No, we weren't.

02:39.342 --> 02:41.674
We... we were...
making out!

02:41.711 --> 02:44.009
Peggy?!

02:44.047 --> 02:45.309
Then what's <i>this?!</i>

02:45.348 --> 02:47.839
42, eh?

02:47.884 --> 02:48.942
Bobby!

02:48.985 --> 02:50.384
Let me help!

02:50.420 --> 02:52.547
Why? So you can blab to
the whole neighborhood

02:52.589 --> 02:54.318
how much your mother's
haircuts cost?

02:54.357 --> 02:55.915
I'm not a little kid.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.721
Now, where were we?

02:59.762 --> 03:00.990
Ah...

03:01.030 --> 03:02.224
Oh, no.

03:02.265 --> 03:04.028
It was the phone bill.

03:05.201 --> 03:06.293
Yep.

03:06.336 --> 03:07.928
Yup.

03:07.971 --> 03:09.404
Mm-hmm.

03:09.439 --> 03:11.737
My boy asked me
how much money I make.

03:11.774 --> 03:13.105
The nerve!

03:13.142 --> 03:14.632
The less kids know
about money,

03:14.677 --> 03:16.645
the less likely they are
to rat you out

03:16.679 --> 03:19.011
under the pressure
of a federal investigation.

03:19.048 --> 03:20.982
I tell you what,
it's tough enough

03:21.017 --> 03:23.850
to teach a kid to judge people
on their character

03:23.887 --> 03:27.220
without TV and the MTV filling
their heads with nonsense.

03:27.257 --> 03:28.690
TV is an open sewer!

03:28.725 --> 03:30.989
Yeah, man, I tell
you what, man.

03:31.027 --> 03:32.255
On dang ol' <i>MTV Cribs,</i> man,

03:32.295 --> 03:33.660
talking about ol' Ja Rule
on there, man.

03:33.696 --> 03:35.096
He got a dang ol'
whole refrigerator

03:35.098 --> 03:36.738
full of that ol'
"Crystal" champagne, man.

03:36.766 --> 03:38.893
Well, I better head in
for dinner.

03:38.935 --> 03:40.960
Bobby's probably
badgering Peggy

03:41.004 --> 03:43.370
about how much
her wedding ring cost.

03:45.108 --> 03:48.168
So... how much you think
ol' Hank <i>is</i> pulling down?

03:48.211 --> 03:49.678
I'll tell you what, man.

03:49.712 --> 03:51.839
That dang ol' blue
truck last year,

03:51.881 --> 03:53.508
they don't come cheap, man.

03:55.518 --> 03:56.746
Gotcha!

03:56.786 --> 03:58.583
Yep, got my check today.

03:58.621 --> 04:01.089
So? How much was it for?

04:01.124 --> 04:02.614
Not to be Bobby about it.

04:02.659 --> 04:03.887
A thousand dollars.

04:03.927 --> 04:05.326
That's right.

04:05.361 --> 04:06.794
You're going to have dinner

04:06.829 --> 04:09.263
with the man who made
a thousand dollars today.

04:12.235 --> 04:15.033
Well, that's a pretty
generous bonus.

04:15.071 --> 04:17.005
Yep. Not quite
as good as last year,

04:17.040 --> 04:20.134
but people just aren't grilling
like they did last year.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.041
Boy, last year
was something else.

04:22.077 --> 04:24.046
<i>So, the way I figure it,</i>

04:24.080 --> 04:28.312
my dad makes a
thousand dollars a day.

04:28.351 --> 04:30.979
That's $365,000 a year.

04:31.020 --> 04:31.816
Whoa!

04:31.854 --> 04:33.287
Yeah, whoa.

04:33.323 --> 04:35.382
But check it out.

04:35.425 --> 04:36.892
He's been doing it

04:36.926 --> 04:38.587
for 20 years.

04:38.628 --> 04:42.223
That's... $7,300,000!

04:42.265 --> 04:43.391
No way!

04:43.433 --> 04:45.799
Yeah, and he barely
spends a dime,

04:45.835 --> 04:48.201
so he's got all that
money just sitting around.

04:48.237 --> 04:49.465
What's he spending it on?

04:49.505 --> 04:50.529
Our house?

04:51.941 --> 04:55.433
That thing cost a million,
maybe two million, tops.

04:55.478 --> 04:56.775
I don't know.

04:56.813 --> 04:58.440
Are you sure about this?

04:58.481 --> 05:01.678
<i>There's got to be
something somewhere</i>

05:01.718 --> 05:04.448
that proves we're rich.

05:08.191 --> 05:09.749
"Oil records"?

05:13.997 --> 05:15.521
Why is it locked?

05:15.565 --> 05:19.661
Because it's about my
dad's secret oil wells.

05:19.702 --> 05:21.260
My dad's got oil!

05:21.304 --> 05:22.566
Dude, you're rich.

05:22.605 --> 05:24.505
You're-you're <i>really</i> rich.

05:24.540 --> 05:26.132
I <i>am</i>.

05:26.175 --> 05:28.609
This is so cool.

05:35.418 --> 05:36.817
Tell you what, Bobby.

05:36.853 --> 05:40.084
Let's say we tally ho it over
to the money room.

05:40.123 --> 05:43.286
Capital idea, Dad, capital.

05:56.639 --> 05:58.300
Well done, son.

05:58.341 --> 06:00.104
Thank you, Father.

06:10.119 --> 06:11.746
<i>I don't know, Bobby</i>.

06:11.788 --> 06:15.121
We've lived next door
to you guys for a long time.

06:15.158 --> 06:16.523
You don't seem rich.

06:16.559 --> 06:18.459
I mean, you guys don't have

06:18.494 --> 06:20.086
<i>half</i> the stuff we do,

06:20.129 --> 06:22.597
and everything you <i>do</i> have,
we have a better version of.

06:22.632 --> 06:24.759
Well, my dad's always going off

06:24.801 --> 06:27.292
about how cheap stuff
is <i>just</i> as good

06:27.336 --> 06:28.633
as expensive stuff.

06:28.671 --> 06:31.538
He spent half of dinner
last night saying,

06:31.574 --> 06:34.771
"Anyone who says
they could tell the difference

06:34.811 --> 06:38.872
between this and real Coca-Cola
is lying, I tell you what."

06:38.915 --> 06:40.849
Well, I guess it's possible.

06:40.883 --> 06:43.875
Maybe your dad
is one of those rich misers.

06:43.920 --> 06:45.012
A what?

06:45.054 --> 06:46.988
A lot of rich people
are just crazy.

06:47.023 --> 06:48.752
They hang on to every penny.

06:48.791 --> 06:50.088
Howard Hughes would wear

06:50.126 --> 06:51.593
Kleenex boxes on his feet,

06:51.627 --> 06:53.993
and he wrote
a whole instruction manual

06:54.030 --> 06:57.261
on the exact way his staff
should serve him a peach.

06:57.300 --> 07:01.896
My dad wrote a 13-step system
for putting away groceries.

07:01.938 --> 07:03.872
Oh! And there was
this woman.

07:03.906 --> 07:06.739
They called her
"The Witch of Wall Street."

07:06.776 --> 07:09.643
She was so cheap
that when her son got sick,

07:09.679 --> 07:11.977
she wouldn't even pay
for a doctor,

07:12.014 --> 07:14.505
and they had to cut
the kid's leg off!

07:14.550 --> 07:16.040
Whoa!
Gross.

07:16.085 --> 07:18.610
Boy, it seems like
the richer people get,

07:18.654 --> 07:20.019
the cheaper they get.

07:20.056 --> 07:22.616
And the cheaper they get,
the crazier they get.

07:22.658 --> 07:25.422
Bobby, time to wrap pennies!

07:28.598 --> 07:30.122
Dang it, Peggy, who threw out

07:30.166 --> 07:31.656
this mayonnaise jar?

07:31.701 --> 07:34.135
I use these to
store extra screws.

07:41.577 --> 07:42.771
Look at him!

07:42.812 --> 07:44.973
Breaking his
back to wash his truck.

07:45.014 --> 07:46.140
Oh, God.

07:46.182 --> 07:47.706
I don't want to lose my leg.

07:47.750 --> 07:48.978
Can you imagine

07:49.018 --> 07:51.043
the cheap fake leg
he's going to buy me?

07:51.087 --> 07:52.782
He'll probably just
make it himself

07:52.822 --> 07:54.756
out of a broom handle
and a shoe horn.

07:54.790 --> 07:56.348
I don't think he's <i>that</i> crazy.

07:56.392 --> 07:58.326
Yet!

07:58.361 --> 08:00.829
But I can't take any chances.

08:00.863 --> 08:03.127
He just needs to loosen up.

08:03.166 --> 08:05.794
Maybe if I can get him
to spend a little money

08:05.835 --> 08:08.030
and see it's not
the end of the world,

08:08.070 --> 08:09.196
he <i>won't</i> go crazy.

08:09.238 --> 08:11.638
Hey, go ask him
to buy us some horses.

08:11.674 --> 08:13.437
We'll ride them to school.

08:13.476 --> 08:14.670
We'll be legends.

08:14.710 --> 08:17.270
No, I've got to find
something <i>he</i> likes,

08:17.313 --> 08:20.282
ease him into prying open
that wallet of his.

08:20.316 --> 08:22.409
When he sees
how much fun it is,

08:22.451 --> 08:25.318
there won't be anything
standing between me

08:25.354 --> 08:28.619
and that sweet
chinga-ching-ching.

08:28.658 --> 08:30.956
<i>Hey, did you guys hear?</i>

08:30.993 --> 08:32.119
Bobby's rich.

08:32.160 --> 08:33.559
Turns out Mr. Hill

08:33.596 --> 08:36.155
is some kind of crazy
millionaire oil something.

08:36.198 --> 08:37.826
Joseph, Sug, you know better

08:37.866 --> 08:40.164
than to spread
silly gossip like that.

08:40.203 --> 08:41.864
What did Reverend Stroup say?

08:41.904 --> 08:45.067
It was something about Jesus
and gossip, and it rhymed.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.734
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.971
Tell me more of Hank's
fortune, Joseph.

08:49.011 --> 08:50.842
Connie says he's some kind

08:50.880 --> 08:53.371
of, like, rich miser
orsomething.

08:53.416 --> 08:55.475
<i>The Millionaire Next Door</i>.

08:55.518 --> 08:59.454
I read that book, but I had no
idea it was about Hank.

09:00.856 --> 09:02.915
Hank, will you buy me
a ratchet set?

09:02.959 --> 09:04.221
No, Dale.

09:04.260 --> 09:05.625
How about a nightclub?

09:05.661 --> 09:08.061
I'll call it "Hank's."

09:08.097 --> 09:09.621
<i>Just how soft</i> are

09:09.665 --> 09:11.257
these soft begging strips?

09:11.300 --> 09:14.167
'Cause, uh, Ladybird's gums
are very sensitive.

09:14.203 --> 09:15.670
Hey, Dad, look at this.

09:15.705 --> 09:19.903
"Now you and your dog can ride
a burro into the Grand Canyon."

09:19.942 --> 09:22.103
Huh, so they put the reins
right in her teeth.

09:22.144 --> 09:25.238
I know.
Can you believe it?

09:25.281 --> 09:27.749
Ladybird gets to keep
the sombrero.

09:27.783 --> 09:29.910
Ladybird looks great in a hat.

09:29.952 --> 09:31.078
Well, she sure does,

09:31.120 --> 09:32.417
but I don't know.

09:32.455 --> 09:34.286
Don't think about it;
just do it.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.483
You deserve it!

09:35.524 --> 09:37.424
God knows <i>Ladybird</i> deserves it.

09:38.628 --> 09:40.858
There's a sing-along
at the bottom.

09:40.896 --> 09:42.989
Well, it does sound
pretty great.

09:43.032 --> 09:44.090
It <i>is</i> great.

09:44.133 --> 09:45.623
You'll have the time
of your life,

09:45.668 --> 09:47.033
and I'll get a pinball machine

09:47.069 --> 09:48.366
and have the time of <i>my</i> life.

09:48.404 --> 09:49.200
What?

09:49.238 --> 09:50.262
And then I'll get

09:50.306 --> 09:52.365
a Slurpee machine
and a white tiger.

09:52.408 --> 09:55.343
Oh, thank you, Dad.
This is going to be so great.

09:55.378 --> 09:56.640
Dang it, Bobby.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.772
I'm not going to start
tossing money around

09:58.814 --> 10:00.714
like a drunken
roughneck on payday

10:00.750 --> 10:03.116
just because you don't
have any money sense.

10:03.152 --> 10:04.278
Look at her.

10:04.320 --> 10:05.480
She's crushed.

10:06.789 --> 10:08.780
You happy now?

10:14.864 --> 10:16.661
Bobby, sit down.
We need to talk.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.031
Have you reconsidered
the pinball machine?

10:22.772 --> 10:24.569
Son, everything you buy
costs money,

10:24.607 --> 10:26.006
which somebody has to earn.

10:26.042 --> 10:27.270
Now, one way or another,

10:27.310 --> 10:29.141
I'm going to get you
thinking right.

10:29.178 --> 10:31.772
But I'm not the one
thinking crazy.

10:31.814 --> 10:34.476
Now see, that's exactly
why your mother and I

10:34.517 --> 10:36.451
have decided to make
some changes

10:36.485 --> 10:37.918
with your allowance.

10:40.723 --> 10:43.715
But that's how much
I <i>always</i> got.

10:43.759 --> 10:45.727
Hold on.
I'm not done yet.

10:45.761 --> 10:48.355
Now, you rented that video game
last Friday, so...

10:49.765 --> 10:51.892
Oh, and, uh,
you returned it late...

10:51.934 --> 10:53.595
Hey, quit it!

10:53.636 --> 10:55.365
And you bought
that <i>Teen People</i>

10:55.404 --> 10:56.837
at the Get In Get Out.

10:56.872 --> 10:58.499
I've itemized it all here

10:58.541 --> 11:00.600
on your invoice.

11:00.643 --> 11:01.940
Two dollars?

11:01.977 --> 11:04.912
But I wanted to go to the movies
with Joseph today.

11:04.947 --> 11:08.246
That sounds like fun,
and I'd be happy to drive you,

11:08.284 --> 11:10.445
if you can earn the rest
of the money you need.

11:10.486 --> 11:12.852
Hey, you could collect cans.
Five cents each.

11:12.888 --> 11:15.413
It's like the streets
are littered with nickels.

11:15.458 --> 11:17.187
You gotta be kidding!

11:17.226 --> 11:19.717
Nope. Oh, you're going
to need a couple

11:19.762 --> 11:21.320
of heavy-duty
garbage bags.

11:21.364 --> 11:22.763
This ought to cover 'em.

11:26.936 --> 11:30.030
Don't be surprised if Bobby comes
around asking for those cans.

11:31.307 --> 11:34.504
I taught him
an important lesson today.

11:40.216 --> 11:43.674
Go ahead there, Hank,
take <i>all</i> the beer you want.

11:43.719 --> 11:46.711
I am so <i>thrilled</i> my hard-earned
money can make you happy.

11:46.756 --> 11:48.883
It was your turn
to buy the beer, Bill...

11:48.924 --> 11:50.357
that's how it works.

11:50.393 --> 11:52.793
Yeah, I guess that's
<i>exactly</i> how it works.

11:52.828 --> 11:55.888
I'm not getting rich
cutting people's hair, Hank.

11:55.931 --> 11:57.728
Well, things are tough
all over.

11:57.767 --> 12:00.759
Oh! I <i>bet</i> they are.

12:02.872 --> 12:03.964
Yep.

12:04.006 --> 12:05.769
Yep.
Mm-hmm.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.435
Please! Just give me

12:07.476 --> 12:09.410
a few thousand dollars,
Hank. Please?

12:09.445 --> 12:12.107
What? Oh, just give
him the money, Hank!

12:12.148 --> 12:14.708
Yeah, man, you know, that dang ol'
money's like the wind, man...

12:14.750 --> 12:16.183
only feel it when
it's moving, man.

12:16.218 --> 12:19.745
My God, am I the only
sane person around here?

12:19.789 --> 12:21.347
Way to go, <i>Bill</i>.

12:21.390 --> 12:24.052
You single-handedly
derailed the gravy train.

12:24.093 --> 12:27.392
I'm sorry. I just wanted
his money, is all.

12:27.430 --> 12:29.227
Collect cans.

12:29.265 --> 12:31.165
My dad had his chance at life.

12:31.200 --> 12:33.464
I'm not going to let him
take mine away.

12:33.502 --> 12:37.165
If this isn't an emergency,
I don't know what is.

12:37.206 --> 12:38.935
Oh, no way, Bobby.

12:38.974 --> 12:40.942
You're not going to take
your dad's credit card...

12:40.976 --> 12:41.806
are you?

12:41.844 --> 12:43.436
Relax. Whatever we spend,

12:43.479 --> 12:45.606
it's just a drop
in the bucket to him.

12:45.648 --> 12:46.808
Besides,

12:46.849 --> 12:49.682
he won't even notice
this one is gone.

12:53.789 --> 12:55.484
Go, go, go, go!

12:58.227 --> 12:59.626
$43.20.

12:59.662 --> 13:01.630
No problem. Here you go.

13:06.635 --> 13:07.863
Thank you, Mr. Hill.

13:11.140 --> 13:13.131
Wow! Wow! Wow!

13:17.379 --> 13:18.346
Whoa!

13:18.380 --> 13:19.938
Don't give up, Connie!

13:19.982 --> 13:22.450
Try it again! I'm rich!

13:25.354 --> 13:28.448
You hooked it. Try again!

13:31.961 --> 13:33.929
Great drive!

13:40.970 --> 13:44.804
Oh, Johnny, I am having
a wonderful time today.

13:44.840 --> 13:46.831
Me, too.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.176
So the rumors about
Hank are true.

13:52.214 --> 13:53.681
Hey,

13:53.716 --> 13:56.378
I just remembered, I should get
back to the healing center.

13:56.418 --> 14:00.354
Oh. But we were going
to buy you a bathing suit.

14:00.389 --> 14:03.085
Next time, okay?
That's my girl.

14:09.331 --> 14:11.356
Well, hey there, John Redcorn.

14:11.400 --> 14:12.492
Hank.

14:13.636 --> 14:15.433
Hank.

14:15.471 --> 14:17.837
America is aging.

14:17.873 --> 14:21.206
The Baby Boomers
will soon become the Senior Boomers.

14:21.243 --> 14:23.643
Yeah... sure, I guess so.

14:23.679 --> 14:24.668
Good, good.

14:24.713 --> 14:26.010
As an established leader

14:26.048 --> 14:27.811
in the healing community,

14:27.850 --> 14:32.082
I am in a unique position to capture
this <i>emerging</i> market.

14:32.121 --> 14:34.521
I think you know where
I'm going with this.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.654
For your investment of
only a million dollars...

14:38.694 --> 14:40.218
What?
I'm not asking for a handout.

14:40.262 --> 14:43.163
This is an investment
opportunity

14:43.198 --> 14:47.066
in the New Age Golden Years
Assisted Living facility.

14:47.102 --> 14:49.662
Sure, I'll give you
your million.

14:49.705 --> 14:50.831
Would you like it

14:50.873 --> 14:52.500
in rubies or fairy dust?

14:52.541 --> 14:57.103
Someone's going to make a
lot of money off this idea.

14:57.146 --> 14:58.875
It could have been us.

15:02.184 --> 15:04.345
<i>Coming up next,
find out what this man</i>

15:04.386 --> 15:06.718
wants to show <i>your</i> children.

15:09.224 --> 15:11.089
All right, Peggy,
tell me what happens.

15:11.126 --> 15:13.390
Oh, my God, that is shocking!

15:13.429 --> 15:14.657
Dang it.

15:14.697 --> 15:15.857
Hello?

15:15.898 --> 15:18.059
Yes, Mr. Hill,
this is a courtesy call

15:18.100 --> 15:20.591
from Southwest Mutual
about your credit card.

15:20.636 --> 15:22.570
Uh, I've already got
a credit card.

15:22.605 --> 15:25.574
No, Mr. Hill, we were calling
about some unusual charges.

15:25.608 --> 15:27.940
We've got a spike
of several thousand dollars

15:27.977 --> 15:29.410
over the last two days.

15:29.445 --> 15:33.643
What? N-No. That card's
never been used. Thief!

15:33.682 --> 15:36.480
Sir, if you would like
to dispute these charges...

15:36.518 --> 15:38.349
Oh, here's something.

15:38.387 --> 15:40.981
There's an attempted charge
coming through right now.

15:41.023 --> 15:43.856
Would you like me
to have them hold the card?

15:47.129 --> 15:50.292
Uh, I-I'm sorry,
Mr. Hill.

15:50.332 --> 15:54.462
This... m-machine is so...
damn slow.

15:54.503 --> 15:56.528
Oh, take your time,
take your time.

15:56.572 --> 16:00.008
You know, Emiglio,
on second thought,

16:00.042 --> 16:02.670
I think I will try on
that vest.

16:03.979 --> 16:06.971
Where is that bastard?

16:07.016 --> 16:08.278
Ta-da!

16:08.317 --> 16:09.284
Bobby?

16:09.318 --> 16:11.479
Dad.

16:15.457 --> 16:17.084
You stole my credit card.

16:17.126 --> 16:19.151
My boy stole my credit card.

16:19.194 --> 16:21.059
Why are you so mad?

16:21.096 --> 16:23.564
Can't you just pump
a little extra propane?

16:26.802 --> 16:28.702
How did you get to be
a spoiled rich kid

16:28.737 --> 16:30.705
when we're not even rich?

16:36.612 --> 16:38.842
Okay, I'm sorry I borrowed...

16:38.881 --> 16:40.280
Stole.
...the credit card,

16:40.315 --> 16:41.782
but you just would've said no,

16:41.817 --> 16:43.341
and we both know
you're loaded.

16:43.385 --> 16:46.081
So let's just say
we were both wrong.

16:46.121 --> 16:47.588
I'm loaded?

16:47.623 --> 16:50.456
Has everybody in the
neighborhood lost their minds?

16:50.492 --> 16:52.221
Okay, Dad, I'll come clean.

16:52.261 --> 16:53.751
I know everything.

16:53.796 --> 16:57.357
I heard you talking about
how you make $1,000 a day.

16:57.399 --> 16:59.230
$1,000 a...

16:59.268 --> 17:00.860
You mean my bonus?

17:00.903 --> 17:02.894
My once-a-year bonus?

17:02.938 --> 17:05.372
But what about your oil records?

17:05.406 --> 17:06.704
In the garage?

17:06.742 --> 17:09.472
You mean my oil
<i>change</i> records?

17:12.614 --> 17:13.979
I used to think

17:14.016 --> 17:15.950
you were too young
for this conversation,

17:15.983 --> 17:17.473
but I think
we've all had enough

17:17.519 --> 17:19.714
of you learning about money
on the streets,

17:19.755 --> 17:22.280
so here goes: Our checkbook.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.560
I didn't even see anything.

17:27.496 --> 17:29.487
Okay, you want to know

17:29.531 --> 17:32.295
about the family finances?

17:36.905 --> 17:38.099
Here.

17:39.007 --> 17:40.975
So this is it?

17:41.009 --> 17:45.070
Please tell me you've at least got
some gold buried in the backyard.

17:45.114 --> 17:47.048
Nope. That's it.

17:47.082 --> 17:49.915
But with responsible
budgeting, we do fine.

17:49.952 --> 17:52.113
That's our
entertainment budget?

17:52.154 --> 17:55.419
But I spend that much
on CDs every month.

17:55.457 --> 17:57.584
I use up the whole budget.

17:57.626 --> 17:59.025
Yep.

17:59.061 --> 18:01.325
I guess I let you down.

18:03.532 --> 18:04.829
What the?

18:04.867 --> 18:07.392
That must be the jet-ski.

18:08.737 --> 18:10.364
Well, I was able

18:10.405 --> 18:13.135
to pay off everything
except the jet-ski.

18:13.175 --> 18:15.575
Had to use my whole bonus
and then some.

18:16.912 --> 18:19.278
Guess I'll never get
that new shower pan.

18:19.314 --> 18:20.679
Sorry.

18:20.716 --> 18:22.206
So here's your punishment.

18:22.251 --> 18:24.515
I'm going to get
whatever I can for the jet-ski,

18:24.553 --> 18:26.020
and you're going to do chores

18:26.054 --> 18:27.851
until you work off
the difference

18:27.890 --> 18:29.619
between that
and what it costs.

18:29.658 --> 18:30.818
Okay.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.759
Now, uh,
your mother said something

18:32.795 --> 18:34.626
about a date with, uh...

18:34.663 --> 18:36.756
Madam Von Toilet scrubbin?

18:36.799 --> 18:38.858
Anyvun seen Bobby?

18:44.072 --> 18:45.699
Good job, Bobby.

18:45.741 --> 18:47.072
Hey, it looks hot up there.

18:47.109 --> 18:48.872
Why don't you come down
and take a break?

18:48.911 --> 18:51.379
Breaks are for guys
on disability.

18:51.413 --> 18:52.778
Well, I do need some help

18:52.815 --> 18:55.079
getting the jet-ski
down to the lake to sell it.

18:55.117 --> 18:57.210
I'm on it...
just as soon as I'm done

18:57.252 --> 18:59.186
fishing out this squirrel.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.624
So Hank frittered away
his fortune.

19:07.663 --> 19:10.655
God, if Peggy was the best
he could do <i>with</i> money,

19:10.699 --> 19:13.429
what's going to happen now
when she leaves him?

19:13.468 --> 19:16.198
Man, you talk about how the mighty
have dang ol' fallen, man.

19:16.238 --> 19:19.366
Mm-hmm. I heard it had something
to do with the Internet.

19:19.408 --> 19:21.842
Usually does.

19:23.512 --> 19:25.275
Brand-new jet-ski
for sale.

19:25.314 --> 19:26.941
Got all the, uh, features

19:26.982 --> 19:30.008
and, uh, really spiffy
paint job there.

19:30.052 --> 19:31.952
Sure was expensive.

19:39.261 --> 19:42.628
Hey, Eric, what do you
think of that jet-ski?

19:44.733 --> 19:46.633
You promised me a new one!

19:46.668 --> 19:48.761
This one's probably broken.

19:48.804 --> 19:49.634
It's not broken.

19:51.139 --> 19:52.868
Fine, I'll prove it to you.

19:54.576 --> 19:57.943
Okay, then,
it runs perfectly fine. Happy?

19:57.980 --> 20:00.141
Can't it go any faster?

20:00.182 --> 20:01.740
Of course it can.

20:04.353 --> 20:07.789
Heh-heh. Well, I'll be.

20:07.823 --> 20:09.450
Whoo! Giddyap!

20:11.526 --> 20:13.323
Boy, that was fun. Heh.

20:13.362 --> 20:15.091
It's okay, I <i>guess</i>.

20:15.130 --> 20:16.392
We'll take it.

20:16.431 --> 20:19.457
Okay, I-I know
I-I promised you a jet-ski,

20:19.501 --> 20:22.436
but could you at least say...
thank you?

20:22.471 --> 20:26.339
Whatever! I'll get mom's
new boyfriend to buy it for me.

20:26.375 --> 20:29.310
Sir, for 50 cents,
I will shine this baby up

20:29.344 --> 20:30.936
like a brand-new dime.

20:30.979 --> 20:33.140
I want to see my face.

20:33.181 --> 20:34.648
All right!

20:46.795 --> 20:49.093
Dad! Go back!

20:49.131 --> 20:52.032
They're not going
to wait around for us!

20:52.067 --> 20:53.295
We're not selling it.

20:53.335 --> 20:56.736
Now, hold on tight,
I'm going to gun it.

20:59.241 --> 21:00.970
We're going to keep it?!

21:01.009 --> 21:03.102
We can't afford it.

21:03.145 --> 21:06.376
I'm not selling your jet-ski
to that little jackass.

21:06.415 --> 21:08.975
I figure the depreciation's
the same on it

21:09.017 --> 21:11.417
whether we keep it
for a day or a year.

21:11.453 --> 21:12.920
Used is used, right?

21:12.955 --> 21:15.321
