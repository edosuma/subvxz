WEBVTT

00:02.670 --> 00:04.092
- THIS IS CRAZY, THIS IS CRAZY,
THIS IS CRAZY, GUS.

00:04.130 --> 00:05.859
WE HAVEN'T HAD A CASE
IN, LIKE, TWO MONTHS.

00:05.900 --> 00:08.391
- LET'S FACE IT, SHAWN,
TROUT IS NEVER GOING TO HIRE US.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.532
MAN, I'M EXHAUSTED.
I'M GOING TO BED.

00:09.570 --> 00:10.730
GOOD NIGHT.

00:10.770 --> 00:11.998
- I WILL FACE
NO SUCH THING,

00:12.040 --> 00:12.938
AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU,
BURTON GUSTER.

00:12.980 --> 00:14.868
YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY?

00:14.910 --> 00:18.073
BECAUSE YOUR ANCESTORS DIED
FIGHTING FOR YOUR INHERENT RIGHT

00:18.110 --> 00:20.715
TO HAVE A FAKE PSYCHIC
DETECTIVE AGENCY.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.581
- MY ANCESTORS DIED
OF HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,

00:22.620 --> 00:24.019
WHICH IS NOT GOING
TO HAPPEN TO ME

00:24.050 --> 00:25.745
BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA STRESS
OVER THINGS

00:25.790 --> 00:27.485
THAT I CAN'T CONTROL.
GOOD NIGHT.

00:27.520 --> 00:28.782
- GUS!

00:28.820 --> 00:30.481
DUDE,
YOU JUST NAILED IT.

00:30.530 --> 00:31.758
WE HAVE BEEN GOING ABOUT THIS
THE WRONG WAY.

00:34.460 --> 00:35.654
WE'LL JUST MAKE UP
OUR OWN CASE.

00:35.700 --> 00:36.997
- HOW?

00:37.030 --> 00:38.827
- BY PLANTING CLUES
AND EVIDENCE

00:38.870 --> 00:40.132
AND THEN LEADING THE COPS
TO SAID CLUES AND EVIDENCE

00:40.170 --> 00:42.035
AND THEN GETTING HIRED
TO SOLVE THE CASE.

00:42.070 --> 00:44.004
- THE CASE THAT WE MADE UP WHEN
WE FILED A FALSE CRIME REPORT.

00:44.040 --> 00:45.905
- BUT NOBODY GETS HURT.
NOBODY EVEN DIES.

00:45.940 --> 00:47.828
- RIGHT.
BECAUSE WE FALSIFIED EVIDENCE.

00:47.880 --> 00:49.745
- IT WILL HOLD UP.
- ONCE WE PERJURE OURSELVES.

00:49.780 --> 00:52.578
- NO.
WHEN WE GET PAID.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.770
- MAN, YOU KNOW
I'M NOT TIRED ANYMORE.

00:54.820 --> 00:59.610
- I KNOW EXACTLY WHICH CRIME
WE CAN FAKE.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.582
A PUPPETEER IS MURDERED,

01:01.620 --> 01:03.929
AND THE ONLY WITNESSES
TO THE CRIME

01:03.960 --> 01:05.188
ARE HIS PUPPETS.

01:05.230 --> 01:06.754
THEN I PSYCHICALLY SAY

01:06.800 --> 01:09.166
THAT ONE OF THE PUPPETS
IS THE MURDERER.

01:09.200 --> 01:12.237
- WHICH ONE?

01:12.270 --> 01:15.159
[clicks tongue] YOU MUST BE OUT
OF YOUR DAMN MIND, SHAWN. NO.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.600
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NO?
- BUT HOW 'BOUT THIS?

01:17.640 --> 01:19.505
THE WINNER OF A COMPETITIVE
FOOD EATING COMPETITION

01:19.540 --> 01:20.768
GOES MISSING.

01:20.810 --> 01:22.107
THERE'S SIGNS
OF FOUL PLAY.

01:22.150 --> 01:24.539
WE SAY IT'S MURDER.

01:26.650 --> 01:28.413
- DUDE, NO.

01:28.450 --> 01:29.986
- HMM?
- HOWEVER...

01:30.020 --> 01:34.957
[cries out,
muffled speech]

01:34.990 --> 01:36.855
- NINJA, PLEASE.

01:36.890 --> 01:39.290
YOU KNOW I CAN'T UNDERSTAND
ANYTHING YOU'RE SAYING.

01:39.330 --> 01:41.389
- MAN, I'M OUT OF IDEAS!

01:41.430 --> 01:43.591
- THAT'S IT, I'M GOING HOME.
WE JUST WASTED THE WHOLE NIGHT.

01:43.630 --> 01:45.769
- FINE.
BUT IT WAS NOT A WASTE.

01:45.800 --> 01:48.769
I CHOOSE TO BELIEVE THAT IF
WE PUT POSITIVE ENERGY AND VIBES

01:48.800 --> 01:50.199
OUT INTO THE UNIVERSE,

01:50.240 --> 01:51.832
THE UNIVERSE WILL
REWARD THAT POSITIVITY

01:51.870 --> 01:53.076
BY MAKING SOMEONE
GET MURDERED...

01:53.110 --> 01:54.998
OR BLUDGEONED
OR ROBBED.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.076
I DON'T CARE.
JUST SO WE CAN SOLVE THE CASE.

01:57.110 --> 01:58.941
- MAN, LET'S HOPE SO.

01:58.980 --> 02:01.119
- [sighs]

02:13.300 --> 02:15.860
[car alarm wailing]

02:27.880 --> 02:29.575
- EXCUSE ME.

02:29.610 --> 02:31.942
EXCUSE ME,
CAN I HELP YOU?

02:31.980 --> 02:34.039
- I'M FINE.

02:34.080 --> 02:37.686
JUST GONNA GET THIS BODY
TO THE MORTUARY.

02:37.720 --> 02:40.052
- OH, OH, NO, WAIT.
HE'S A JOHN DOE.

02:40.090 --> 02:41.216
I HAVEN'T DONE
THE AUTOPSY YET.

02:41.260 --> 02:42.488
WANNA COME BACK
IN THE MORNING?

02:42.530 --> 02:44.486
- NO.

02:44.530 --> 02:47.693
GONNA TAKE THIS BODY
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT.

02:47.730 --> 02:49.698
- GO AHEAD AND TAKE HIM.
I DON'T CARE.

02:49.730 --> 02:52.062
- YO, WOODY!

02:52.100 --> 02:53.465
GOT YOUR STRUDEL.

02:53.500 --> 02:54.990
- BACK OFF.
- OH!

02:55.040 --> 02:56.462
- HEY, WOODY,
DID YOU GET THE--

02:56.510 --> 02:57.704
[gunshot, glass breaking]
OH!

02:57.740 --> 03:00.174
- BACK OFF!
EVERYBODY BACK OFF!

03:04.810 --> 03:07.370
EVERYBODY BACK OFF!

03:09.390 --> 03:12.188
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON DOWN THERE?

03:12.220 --> 03:14.688
FOR GOD'S SAKE,
SPIT IT OUT, MAN.

03:14.720 --> 03:18.486
- [panting]
HOSTAGE--

03:18.530 --> 03:21.988
- PEOPLE, WE HAVE OURSELVES
A SITUATION.

03:22.030 --> 03:25.261
- NOW LOOK
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

03:26.940 --> 03:31.206
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

03:31.240 --> 03:33.504
- * I KNOW YOU KNOW
THAT I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

03:33.540 --> 03:37.408
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

03:37.450 --> 03:38.405
* EMBRACE THE DECEPTION

03:38.450 --> 03:40.509
* LEARN HOW TO BEND

03:40.550 --> 03:43.189
* YOUR WORST INHIBITIONS TEND
TO PSYCH YOU OUT IN THE END *

03:43.220 --> 03:45.017
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

03:45.050 --> 03:48.508
- [screaming]

03:51.090 --> 03:54.093
- OKAY, SLIM,
I'M NOT GONNA HURT YOU.

03:54.130 --> 03:56.997
BUT I CAN'T LET YOU DO
AN AUTOPSY ON THIS BODY,

03:57.030 --> 03:58.725
BECAUSE IF YOU DO,

03:58.770 --> 04:01.295
EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF EVIDENCE
OF A MURDER

04:01.340 --> 04:05.231
WILL POINT
IN MY DIRECTION.

04:05.270 --> 04:07.636
- I-I DON'T WANT
TO PRE-JUDGE,

04:07.680 --> 04:10.274
BUT I DON'T HAVE YOU PEGGED
AS A PATHOLOGIST.

04:10.310 --> 04:11.709
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE REQUIREMENTS ARE

04:11.750 --> 04:13.411
IN YOUR HOME STATE
OF NORTH DAKOTA--

04:13.450 --> 04:15.668
- I'M NOT FROM NORTH DAKOTA.
- ALL RIGHT, SOUTH DAKOTA.

04:15.720 --> 04:16.448
I KNEW IT WAS ONE
OF THE DAKOTAS.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.014
I HAVE A GREAT EAR.

04:18.050 --> 04:19.688
BUT HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY KNOW THAT?

04:19.720 --> 04:21.688
AND THANK YOU
FOR CALLING ME "SLIM."

04:21.720 --> 04:24.826
BOY, IT HAS BEEN A STRUGGLE.
WHEW.

04:24.860 --> 04:27.090
- I FOUND THIS BODY
A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO

04:27.130 --> 04:29.325
IN MY LIVING ROOM,
STABBED TO DEATH

04:29.370 --> 04:32.464
WITH A KNIFE
FROM MY KITCHEN.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.764
I'VE BEEN SET UP.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.301
- ALL RIGHT, ANYONE WHO DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE HERE,

04:36.340 --> 04:38.706
STAY OUT OF MY WAY
AND MY SIGHT LINES.

04:38.740 --> 04:39.968
FROM HERE ON IN,
THIS IS GONNA BE

04:40.010 --> 04:41.807
REFERRED TO
AS MY COMMAND CENTER.

04:41.840 --> 04:43.478
AM I CLEAR?
- CRYSTAL, SIR!

04:43.510 --> 04:46.104
BUT ARE YOU WILLING TO CONSIDER
OTHER NAMES FOR THIS AREA,

04:46.150 --> 04:48.448
SUCH AS "THE HOSTAGE
JUICING ROOM," SIR?

04:48.480 --> 04:49.947
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU TWO
EVEN DOING IN MY STATION?

04:49.990 --> 04:51.719
YOU DON'T WORK HERE.
GET OUT.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.388
IF I EVEN SMELL YOU,
I'M GONNA SHOOT YOU.

04:53.420 --> 04:55.217
- SIR, I BELIEVE
I AM BEING PUNISHED

04:55.260 --> 04:57.319
FOR THE SCENT OF GUSI
COCOA BUTTER OINTMENT, SIR.

04:57.360 --> 05:00.523
- IT'S NOT AN OINTMENT.
IT'S A LOTION.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.221
- ALL RIGHT,
LET'S KEEP IT MOVING HERE.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.024
- OKAY, HARRY,
BUDDY, PAL.

05:05.070 --> 05:06.935
OBVIOUSLY YOU DIDN'T REALIZE
THAT GUS AND I

05:06.970 --> 05:08.597
HAVE BEEN
IN THIS EXACT SITUATION BEFORE,

05:08.640 --> 05:11.006
AND WE CRUSHED IT,
SO LOOK.

05:11.040 --> 05:12.632
YOU CAN JUST SIT BACK AND RELAX,
AND WE'LL HANDLE EVERYTHING.

05:12.680 --> 05:15.638
I'M JUST GONNA NEED
A PIZZA DELIVERY GUY UNIFORM,

05:15.680 --> 05:18.308
AND GUS NEEDS
A DANGEROUS SITUATION DIAPER.

05:18.350 --> 05:19.908
- LISTEN, I DON'T WANT YOU
WITHIN 100 YARDS

05:19.950 --> 05:21.542
OF THIS BUILDING, OKAY?
YOU'RE A LIABILITY.

05:21.580 --> 05:23.047
- BUT WE CAN SOLVE THIS CASE
AND TOUCH HEARTS ALONG THE WAY,

05:23.090 --> 05:25.046
STARTING WITH YOURS.
OKAY.

05:25.090 --> 05:26.751
- SHAWN, LET'S GO.

05:26.790 --> 05:28.212
- THAT'S WOODY IN THERE, MAN.
- EXACTLY.

05:28.260 --> 05:30.125
AND IF THERE IS A LUNATIC
WITH A GUN DOWN THERE,

05:30.160 --> 05:31.855
THINGS ARE GONNA GET DANGEROUS.

05:31.890 --> 05:32.652
IT'S BEST IF YOU TWO
STAY OUT OF THE FRAY

05:32.700 --> 05:34.156
AND LEAVE IT TO THE BIG BOYS.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.498
- YOU STAY, YOU DIE.
OKAY?

05:36.530 --> 05:39.658
- LET'S GO.
- SIR, I AM HERE NOW.

05:39.700 --> 05:40.962
I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER ME
BY YOUR SIDE

05:41.000 --> 05:42.501
AS A SKILLED NEGOTIATOR
AND CO-COMMANDER.

05:42.540 --> 05:44.269
WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

05:44.310 --> 05:45.834
- OKAY, I WANT YOU POSTED

05:45.870 --> 05:47.508
DOWN THE HALLWAY TO THE MORGUE,
ALL RIGHT?

05:47.540 --> 05:49.940
- ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR, WHAT
AM I SUPPOSED TO DO DOWN THERE?

05:49.980 --> 05:51.607
- UH, YOU CAN BE CO-COMMANDER
OF THE HALLWAY.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.311
YOU CAN MAKE SURE
THAT THE DRINKING FOUNTAIN

05:53.350 --> 05:55.568
ISN'T COMPROMISED.
HOW 'BOUT THAT? O'HARA!

05:55.620 --> 05:57.042
- YES.
- I NEED YOU RIGHT HERE,

05:57.090 --> 05:58.239
BY MY SIDE, RIGHT NOW!
- RIGHT HERE.

05:58.290 --> 05:59.655
- ALL RIGHT, NOT THAT CLOSE.
- OKAY.

05:59.690 --> 06:02.056
- THIS ISN'T
DANCING WITH THE STARS.

06:02.090 --> 06:04.229
- I'LL KEEP YOU
IN THE LOOP.

06:04.260 --> 06:06.080
- STUPID JERK.

06:06.130 --> 06:07.427
- UH, CHIEF, THESE ARE
WOODY'S MEDICATIONS

06:07.460 --> 06:08.427
FROM UP HERE
IN THE FRIDGE.

06:08.460 --> 06:09.859
HE TAKES THEM FOR ANXIETY.

06:09.900 --> 06:10.764
SHOULD WE TAKE THEM
DOWN TO HIM?

06:10.800 --> 06:12.290
- ANXIETY?

06:12.330 --> 06:13.729
I CAN'T BE CONCERNED
ABOUT HIS MENTAL STATE.

06:13.770 --> 06:15.431
HE'S HALF BANANAS
ANYWAY, RIGHT?

06:15.470 --> 06:16.835
IT'S LIKE HIS WHEEL IS SPINNING
BUT THE HAMSTER FELL OFF.

06:16.870 --> 06:18.701
OR IT'S DEAD.
I DON'T KNOW.

06:20.940 --> 06:22.441
- I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME

06:22.480 --> 06:24.345
SOMEONE HAS PULLED A GUN ON ME
IN THE MORGUE.

06:24.380 --> 06:26.075
THE LAST ONE WAS
A FORMER COLLEAGUE

06:26.110 --> 06:27.441
I HAD
A SEXUAL HISTORY WITH.

06:27.480 --> 06:29.072
THIS FEELS DIFFERENT.

06:29.120 --> 06:32.419
- I DON'T WANT A CONVERSATION.

06:32.460 --> 06:34.587
UNDERSTAND?

06:36.730 --> 06:41.258
THE LESS YOU TALK,
THE MORE LIKELY YOU STAY ALIVE.

06:41.300 --> 06:44.224
- HEY, ANYTHING YOU SAY
IS BETWEEN ME, YOU,

06:44.270 --> 06:45.589
AND THAT DEAD GUY THERE.

06:45.630 --> 06:47.188
SHOULD WE GIVE HIM
A NAME?

06:47.240 --> 06:51.358
MY VOTE WOULD BE CALEB,
BUT YOUR VOTE COUNTS TOO.

06:51.410 --> 06:54.299
- I KNOW HIS NAME.

06:54.340 --> 06:56.979
IT'S GREER WILSON.

06:57.010 --> 06:58.147
- MM, THAT'S NOT AS GOOD
AS CALEB.

06:58.180 --> 07:00.319
- WE WERE
IN THE JOINT TOGETHER.

07:00.350 --> 07:02.113
- I'M ASSUMING
"THE JOINT" IS NOT

07:02.150 --> 07:04.141
THAT NEW FALAFEL PLACE
ON BROAD STREET?

07:04.190 --> 07:06.658
- WE WERE
IN THE SAME CELLBLOCK.

07:06.690 --> 07:08.954
HAD A BEEF,
GOT INTO A NASTY FIGHT.

07:08.990 --> 07:11.220
EVERYONE SAW IT.

07:11.260 --> 07:14.457
WHEN THEY BROKE UP THE FIGHT,
LAST THING I SAID,

07:14.500 --> 07:17.890
"THE NEXT TIME I SEE YOUR
UGLY FACE, I'M GONNA KILL YOU!"

07:17.930 --> 07:21.297
NOW MY FINGERPRINTS AND DNA
IS ALL OVER HIS BODY,

07:21.340 --> 07:25.106
AND HIS BLOOD
IS ALL OVER MY CARPET.

07:25.140 --> 07:28.371
I DIDN'T DO IT.
SOMEONE IS SE'I'I'ING ME UP.

07:28.410 --> 07:33.143
[phone ringing]

07:34.850 --> 07:36.317
- I BET
THAT'S FOR YOU.

07:36.350 --> 07:38.841
- PICK UP, PICK UP, PICK UP.

07:38.890 --> 07:42.087
[phone ringing]

07:42.120 --> 07:44.384
OH.

07:44.430 --> 07:45.488
- HELLO?

07:45.530 --> 07:47.191
- WELL, HELLO THERE.

07:47.230 --> 07:48.629
THIS IS HARRIS TROUT,
THE INTERIM POLICE CHIEF

07:48.660 --> 07:50.298
OF THE SANTA BARBARA
POLICE DEPARTMENT.

07:50.330 --> 07:52.025
WITH WHOM
AM I SPEAKING?

07:52.070 --> 07:53.958
- THIS IS CYRUS POLK.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.036
- HELLO, CYRUS.

07:56.070 --> 07:57.367
CAN I CALL YOU CYRUS?

07:57.410 --> 07:59.298
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU CALL ME.

07:59.340 --> 08:01.399
- CYRUS, I WANT YOU
TO LISTEN TO MY VOICE.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.146
YOU ARE GONNA BE OKAY.

08:03.180 --> 08:04.807
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE OKAY.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.374
YOU MADE A BAD DECISION,
BUT YOU CAN GET OUT OF THIS

08:06.410 --> 08:07.809
WITHOUT TOO MUCH TROUBLE,
OKAY?

08:07.850 --> 08:09.579
WE ALL HAVE THINGS
TO DO.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.485
PERSONALLY, I HAVE TO GET HOME
IN TIME TO WATCH 2 BROKE GIRLS,

08:11.520 --> 08:14.080
SEE WHAT KIND OF PICKLE
THEY'RE IN THIS WEEK, RIGHT?

08:14.120 --> 08:16.111
- I'VE BEEN SET UP
FOR MURDER.

08:16.160 --> 08:17.889
- YEAH, SEE,
I HATE WHEN THAT HAPPENS.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.818
- I WANTED
TO TAKE THIS BODY

08:19.860 --> 08:22.522
TO HOLD UP THE INVESTIGATION,
SO I COULD PROVE MY INNOCENCE.

08:22.570 --> 08:24.390
- CYRUS, I WOULD HAVE DONE
THE SAME THING AS YOU.

08:24.430 --> 08:26.261
ALL RIGHT, I'LL PUT MY BEST
DETECT IVES ON THIS, OKAY?

08:26.300 --> 08:27.631
IN THE MEANTIME,
I JUST NEED YOU

08:27.670 --> 08:29.558
TO SIT TIGHT
AND NOT GET TOO EXCITABLE, OKAY?

08:29.610 --> 08:32.431
I'M GONNA HANG UP NOW,
BUT WE'RE GONNA TALK SOON.

08:32.470 --> 08:36.133
[line disconnects]

08:36.180 --> 08:38.171
- [whistles]

08:38.210 --> 08:41.077
- I SAID, OUT!

08:41.120 --> 08:43.247
- HE JUST WENT GARY OLDMAN
ON MY ASS.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.884
- UH, YOU MIGHT WANT
TO REPHRASE THAT.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.319
- WHY?
- COME ON.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.420
- YOU ARE AMAZING
AT THIS.

08:50.460 --> 08:52.257
- YEAH, I AM.

08:52.290 --> 08:54.451
- YOU SHOULD KNOW, UH,
WOODY DOWN THERE

08:54.500 --> 08:57.628
IS NOT JUST OUR CORONER,
HE'S A VERY DEAR FRIEND.

08:57.670 --> 09:01.231
SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR DELICATE
AND THOUGHTFUL APPROACH

09:01.270 --> 09:02.828
TO THIS NEJGHOTIATION.

09:02.870 --> 09:06.237
- IT'S REFRESHING
AND, FRANKLY, UNEXPECT ED.

09:06.270 --> 09:07.532
- WELL, THANK YOU, O'HARA.

09:07.580 --> 09:09.138
YEAH, YOU KNOW,
I HAVE MY METHODS.

09:09.180 --> 09:11.603
I WENT THROUGH A SIMILAR ORDEAL
IN POUGHKEEPSIE.

09:11.650 --> 09:13.345
YOU KNOW, I LIKE
TO ESTABLISH A RELATIONSHIP

09:13.380 --> 09:15.848
AND GET TO KNOW THE GUY
AND SEE WHAT HE'S FEELING.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.108
I FIND IT ENHANCES
THE MOMENT

09:17.150 --> 09:20.711
BEFORE I PUT A BULLET
IN HIS HEAD.

09:20.760 --> 09:23.024
- LISTEN,
IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL,

09:23.060 --> 09:27.019
BUT I PROBABLY HAVE TO KILL YOU
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

09:27.060 --> 09:28.698
- THAT'S FAIR.
[exhales]

09:28.730 --> 09:31.494
THIS LAB IS CHOCK-FULL
OF EMBALMING FLUID,

09:31.530 --> 09:33.066
HIGHLY FLAMMABLE.

09:33.100 --> 09:34.260
YOU COULD THREATEN
TO TORCH THE PLACE.

09:34.300 --> 09:36.564
- OH, WHY ARE YOU
TELLING ME THIS?

09:36.610 --> 09:39.738
- WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER.
- BACK. BACK OFF.

09:39.780 --> 09:42.101
- LOOK, I CAN'T DIE.

09:42.140 --> 09:45.177
I HAVE 43 TWI'I'I'ER FOLLOWERS
WHO DEPEND ON ME.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.973
OH, AND I HAVE A DAUGHTER.

09:47.020 --> 09:50.046
JUST PROMISE ME YOU'LL LET ME
CONTINUE TO TWEET.

09:50.090 --> 09:51.819
MY DAUGHTER AND I
ARE ESTRANGED.

09:51.850 --> 09:53.215
KIDS.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.557
ONE DAY,
THEY'RE TUGGING AT YOUR LEG,

09:54.590 --> 09:56.057
ASKING YOU TO LIFI' THEM
ON YOUR SHOULDERS,

09:56.090 --> 09:57.682
AND THE NEXT,
THEY'RE ANGRY AT YOU

09:57.730 --> 09:59.083
BECAUSE YOU DROVE THEM TO
THE DADDY-DAUGHTER DINNER DANCE

09:59.130 --> 10:00.449
IN A HEARSE.

10:00.500 --> 10:02.388
OBVIOUSLY, WE HAVE
SOME TRUST ISSUES.

10:02.430 --> 10:06.161
- I DON'T TRUST ANYBODY,
ESPECIALLY NOT A COP.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.668
THEY LOOK AT ME,
AND THEY SEE AN EX-CON,

10:08.700 --> 10:13.103
AND THEN THEY WRITE ME OFF
AS SOME WEIRD KIND OF ANIMAL.

10:13.140 --> 10:14.676
- WELL, TO BE FAIR TO THEM,
YOU DO COME ACROSS

10:14.710 --> 10:17.599
KIND OF MEAN
AND SUPER SCARY.

10:17.650 --> 10:19.504
PERSONALLY, ME?
I LIKE IT.

10:19.550 --> 10:21.347
- I JUST NEED SOME TIME.

10:21.380 --> 10:24.213
- [gaSPSJ
I HAVE SOMETHING.

10:24.250 --> 10:26.616
I MAY HAVE A WAY
OUT OF THIS FOR YOU.

10:26.660 --> 10:29.549
BUT IT WILL INVOLVE
RADICAL, UNCONVENTIONAL,

10:29.590 --> 10:32.388
OUT-OF-THE-BOX METHODS.

10:32.430 --> 10:34.796
ARE YOU WILLING
TO GO OFF THE GRID?

10:37.700 --> 10:39.520
- [whimpers]

10:39.570 --> 10:41.629
IT'S LIKE TRYING TO CLIMB
A DAMN CHRISTMAS TREE.

10:41.670 --> 10:43.558
WE GO'I'I'A GET
BACK IN THERE, GUS.

10:43.610 --> 10:47.068
- I KNOW, SHAWN, BUT I ALSO
DON'T WANT TO GET ARRESTED.

10:47.110 --> 10:48.634
WHAT?

10:48.680 --> 10:50.272
- THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
LEFT TO DO.

10:50.310 --> 10:51.299
- WE'RE NOT GOING
SHAWSHANK, SHAWN.

10:51.350 --> 10:52.772
- WHY NOT?

10:52.820 --> 10:53.673
- BECAUSE IT WOULD
TAKE US THREE MONTHS.

10:53.720 --> 10:55.711
- RIGHT. DAMN IT.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.388
BUT WOODY IS FAMILY, MAN.

10:57.420 --> 10:58.444
- YESTERDAY,
HE CALLED ME DARNELL.

10:58.490 --> 11:00.287
- FAMILY IS FAMILY,
GUS.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.823
WOODY'S NOT GOING OUT LIKE THAT,
NOT ON OUR WATCH.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.725
- TROUT THREW US OUT,
SHAWN.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.853
AND, AGAIN, THERE'S NO WAY
FOR US TO GET BACK INSIDE THERE

11:06.900 --> 11:09.551
WITHOUT GE'I'I'ING ARRESTED.

11:09.600 --> 11:11.329
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

11:11.370 --> 11:13.235
TROUT THREW OUT
SHAWN SPENCER

11:13.270 --> 11:15.431
AND DARNELL GUSTER.

11:15.470 --> 11:19.736
BUT HE DID NOT THROW OUT
SATCHEL GIZMO AND SOUPCAN SAM.

11:19.780 --> 11:22.135
- COME ON, SON.

11:22.180 --> 11:23.602
- DO YOU HAVE
YOUR HALF OF THE BEARD?

11:23.650 --> 11:26.642
- MAN, YOU KNOW
IT'S IN THE GLOVE COMPARTMENT.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.375
- I'M PROUD OF YOU.
- I'M PROUD OF YOU.

11:28.420 --> 11:31.218
- LET'S DO THIS.

11:31.250 --> 11:34.219
[rock music]

11:34.260 --> 11:37.229
*

11:37.260 --> 11:40.457
[armpit squeaking]

11:45.570 --> 11:48.459
MAN, WE GOT ARRESTED.

11:50.910 --> 11:52.559
- IT'LL TAKE A MIRACLE
FOR US TO GET OUT OF HERE.

11:52.610 --> 11:55.534
- HEY.
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

11:55.580 --> 11:58.071
- MAN!
[shakes door]

12:00.780 --> 12:04.511
[line ringing]

12:04.550 --> 12:06.142
- HELLO, CYRUS.

12:06.190 --> 12:07.680
- I DON'T WANT
TO TALK TO YOU.

12:07.720 --> 12:11.281
I WANT TO TALK TO SOMEONE
WITH THE NAME OF SHAWN--

12:11.330 --> 12:12.752
SHAWN SPENCER AND G--

12:12.800 --> 12:14.358
- [mouthing]

12:14.400 --> 12:16.197
- SHAWN SPENCER
AND GUUTONO SOMEBODY.

12:16.230 --> 12:17.822
I WANT TO TALK
TO THOSE TWO.

12:17.870 --> 12:19.622
- THERE'S NOBODY BY THOSE NAMES
IN THIS DEPARTMENT.

12:19.670 --> 12:21.695
- WELL, THAT'S EXACTLY
WHY I WANT TO TALK TO THEM

12:21.740 --> 12:23.503
AND ONLY THEM,
YOU KNOW?

12:23.540 --> 12:26.202
I WANT TO COMMUNICATE
FACE-TO-FACE, YOU GOT IT?

12:26.240 --> 12:29.300
- THAT'S SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE,
CYRUS.

12:29.340 --> 12:30.568
LET'S BE REASONABLE.

12:30.610 --> 12:32.771
- [whispering] FOOD.
CHEESE, CHEESE.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.048
- AND TOGETHER,
WITH THOSE TWO GUYS,

12:34.080 --> 12:36.469
I WANT YOU
TO SEND SOME CHEESE, OKAY?

12:36.520 --> 12:37.714
- CHEDDAR.
- YEAH, AMERICAN CHEDDAR.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.911
NOT THE SHARP THING.
THE YELLOW ONE.

12:39.960 --> 12:42.212
YOU KNOW? THE MILD.
- [whispering] GRAPES.

12:42.260 --> 12:44.649
- OKAY. GRAPES.
GRAPES. WE NEED GRAPES.

12:44.690 --> 12:46.419
- [spitting]

12:46.460 --> 12:48.155
- SEEDLESS.

12:48.200 --> 12:50.566
ENOUGH!

12:50.600 --> 12:53.194
OKAY, THAT'S ALL.
OVER AND OUT.

12:53.240 --> 12:54.639
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'M SAYING THIS.

12:54.670 --> 12:56.399
O'HARA, GET SPENCER
IN HERE RIGHT AWAY.

12:56.440 --> 12:59.409
[rock music]

12:59.440 --> 13:07.370
*

13:25.330 --> 13:26.627
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS
DOING DOWN HERE?

13:26.670 --> 13:28.160
- LASSIE, RELAX.

13:28.200 --> 13:29.565
WE HAVE BEEN REQUESTED
BY THE ASSAILANT

13:29.600 --> 13:30.828
FOR A FACE-TO-FACER, OKAY?

13:30.870 --> 13:32.667
MY FACE, GUS' FACE.

13:32.710 --> 13:34.473
WE'D INVITE YOUR FACE,
BUT IT WASN'T REQUESTED.

13:34.510 --> 13:35.807
I'M SORRY.
- CHEESE WEDGE?

13:35.840 --> 13:39.549
- YOU HAVE TO STOP
EATING THE CHEESE, MAN.

13:39.580 --> 13:40.808
- GUYS, I'M SERIOUS.
BACK THE HELL UP.

13:40.850 --> 13:42.715
YOU COULD GET SHOT.
THIS IS NO JOKE.

13:42.750 --> 13:44.615
- COP!

13:44.650 --> 13:47.983
INTERLOCK YOUR HANDS,
AND PUT THEM BEHIND YOUR HEAD!

13:49.360 --> 13:50.486
GOOD BOY.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.418
- YOU SONS OF BITCHES.

13:52.460 --> 13:55.554
- YOU TWO, OVER HERE.
NOW.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.489
- HERE WE COME, SORRY.
TOLD YOU.

13:58.530 --> 14:00.168
- ON YOUR KNEES,

14:00.200 --> 14:02.088
AS IF YOU WERE PRAYING
FOR YOUR LIFE.

14:02.140 --> 14:04.062
DROP!

14:07.140 --> 14:09.608
- HEY--
OOH, OKAY.

14:09.640 --> 14:11.346
YEP. THERE.

14:11.380 --> 14:12.745
- [laughs]

14:12.780 --> 14:14.611
STOP.
- WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU?

14:14.650 --> 14:16.811
- SHAWN, YOU KNOW THE BACK
OF MY THIGHS ARE SENSITIVE.

14:16.850 --> 14:18.340
- NO, WHY WOULD I
POSSIBLY KNOW THAT?

14:18.390 --> 14:21.279
GO AHEAD.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.719
- HOW DO YOU GUYS
ALWAYS DO THIS?

14:22.760 --> 14:24.625
HUH?

14:24.660 --> 14:26.548
- HERE YOU GO.

14:26.590 --> 14:28.899
- WOODY HERE TELLS ME
YOU'RE SOME KIND OF GENIUSES.

14:28.930 --> 14:30.420
- YES, THAT'S CORRECT.

14:30.470 --> 14:31.391
- IS THERE SOME CHEESE
MISSING HERE?

14:31.430 --> 14:35.196
LIKE, MAYBE TWO CUBES?

14:35.240 --> 14:37.765
- YOU BETI'ER GIVE ME
ONE GOOD REASON

14:37.810 --> 14:40.472
WHY I SHOULD TRUST
THE TWO OF YOU

14:40.510 --> 14:44.105
AND NOT KILL YOU
RIGHT HERE ON THE SPOT.

14:44.150 --> 14:45.640
- DON'T YOU THINK YOUR TIME
WOULD BE BE'I'I'ER SPENT

14:45.680 --> 14:46.942
GIVING US A LEAD ON
WHO MIGHT HAVE MURDERED

14:46.980 --> 14:50.711
THAT MAN
ON THE TABLE THERE?

14:50.750 --> 14:53.583
- HIS NAME IS GREER WILSON.

14:53.620 --> 14:56.453
WE MOST RECENTLY
CROSSED PATHS

14:56.490 --> 14:59.550
AT A PLACE
CALLED REDEMPTION HOUSE.

14:59.590 --> 15:01.353
- THAT'S THE HALFWAY HOME
IN THE BOONIES

15:01.400 --> 15:03.368
FOR RECENTLY HM'MEASED FELONS.

15:03.400 --> 15:05.288
GUS WRITES LETTERS
TO MEN IN PRISON.

15:05.330 --> 15:07.798
- WELL, IT'S NO SECRET
I HATED HIS GUTS.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.728
SO DID A BUNCH OF GUYS.

15:09.770 --> 15:13.433
MOST OF THOSE GUYS, THEY KNOW
THEIR WAY AROUND A SETUP.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.175
THAT'S WHY I WANT YOU
TO GO DOWN THERE

15:15.210 --> 15:17.201
AS SOON AS YOU CAN, OKAY?

15:17.250 --> 15:18.399
- YOU GOT IT.
- FOR WOODY.

15:18.450 --> 15:19.439
- HEY, HEY!

15:19.480 --> 15:22.870
LISTEN, I...

15:22.920 --> 15:26.344
I GOT A WIFE WHO LOVES ME.

15:26.390 --> 15:30.019
I GOT SOMETHING
TO LIVE FOR.

15:30.060 --> 15:31.721
I'M SURE
YOU CAN RELATE.

15:31.760 --> 15:34.490
- ACTUALLY, THIS TIME, I CAN.

15:34.530 --> 15:37.260
GUS CANNOT.
- WE'LL TAKE THE CASE.

15:37.300 --> 15:39.768
- O'HARA, WHERE'S THE WIFE?

15:39.800 --> 15:41.631
- SHE'S RIGHT HERE.
THIS IS ROSIE POLK

15:41.670 --> 15:44.662
AND EDWARD TRIPP,
HIS PAROLE OFFICER.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.234
- IS HE OKAY? IS CYRUS OKAY?
- IS HE OKAY?

15:46.270 --> 15:48.135
HE'S TAKEN
MY WHOLE POLICE STATION HOSTAGE.

15:48.180 --> 15:49.738
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND

15:49.780 --> 15:51.543
WHAT HAPPENED.
HE SEEMED FINE THIS MORNING.

15:51.580 --> 15:53.218
- HEY, LOOK, WE ALL CAN'T
MARRY WINNERS, HONEY.

15:53.250 --> 15:55.741
YOUR MAN-PICKER WAS WAY OFF ON
THAT ONE, BUT ON A BRIGHT NOTE,

15:55.780 --> 15:57.884
YOU DO HAVE A NICE CABOOSE,
SO YOU SHOULD BOUNCE BACK.

15:57.920 --> 15:59.911
O'HARA, FIND A NICE SPOT FOR HER
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

15:59.950 --> 16:01.178
SO WHEN I NEED YOU,
I'LL CALL YOU, OKAY?

16:01.220 --> 16:03.552
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.

16:03.590 --> 16:05.251
- OKAY, TRIPP,
I'M GONNA NEED YOUR HELP.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.599
- OF COURSE, SIR.
ANYTHING.

16:07.630 --> 16:09.825
- JUST LET ME KNOW
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

16:09.860 --> 16:11.168
- SO, TRIPP, YOU'VE BEEN
DEALING WITH CYRUS

16:11.200 --> 16:12.929
SINCE HE WAS RELEASED,
HUH?

16:12.970 --> 16:16.394
- YES, AND UNFORTUNATELY,
I AM ALSO GREER WILSON'S--

16:16.440 --> 16:18.908
THE VICTIM'S--PAROLE OFFICER.
I KNOW THEM BOTH.

16:18.940 --> 16:21.500
I'M THEIR FIRST CONTACT
WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD, REALLY.

16:21.540 --> 16:23.940
I HELP THEM ADJUST
AS BEST I CAN.

16:23.980 --> 16:26.847
I'M WILLING TO TALK TO CYRUS
IF YOU FEEL IT'S NECESSARY.

16:26.880 --> 16:29.041
- NOPE, RIGHT NOW, I JUST NEED
YOU TO TELL ME HOW TO BREAK HIM.

16:29.080 --> 16:30.684
- SORRY, SIR?

16:30.720 --> 16:32.017
- OR GET HIM TO TURN THE GUN
ON HIMSELF.

16:32.050 --> 16:33.085
THAT'D BE EVEN BETTER.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.917
- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,

16:34.960 --> 16:36.712
I TAKE MY WORK
VERY PERSONALLY.

16:36.760 --> 16:38.125
I BLAME MYSELF.

16:38.160 --> 16:40.720
I SHOULD HAVE
REPORTED THIS EARLIER.

16:40.760 --> 16:41.692
I COULD SEE HIM
COMING UNHINGED,

16:41.730 --> 16:43.266
BUT HE'S NOT A BAD MAN.

16:43.300 --> 16:46.394
- YEAH, WELL, HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
FOREVER.

16:46.430 --> 16:49.092
- [groaning]
OKAY, EVERYBODY.

16:49.140 --> 16:51.700
YOU CAN DO THE SLOW BRUBAKER
CLAP FOR US IF YOU'D LIKE.

16:51.740 --> 16:57.406
[both applaud slowly]

16:57.450 --> 16:59.771
- SO HOW DID IT GO DOWN THERE?
- WOODY'S FINE.

16:59.810 --> 17:01.448
WE'RE GONNA LOOK
INTO CYRUS' CLAIMS.

17:01.480 --> 17:02.708
- I THINK HE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH, JULES.

17:02.750 --> 17:04.638
- YOU DO?
- SURE, HE'S A CRIMINAL.

17:04.690 --> 17:05.782
GOT A RAP SHEET
LONGER THAN A LIST

17:05.820 --> 17:07.253
OF GUS' ERRONEOUS ZONES.

17:07.290 --> 17:08.917
- EROGENOUS ZONES.
- HE'S ON FIRE TODAY.

17:08.960 --> 17:11.224
BUT THEY'RE ALL PETTY THEFI'S,
B&Es.

17:11.260 --> 17:12.852
THIS GUY IS NOT A MURDERER.
IT DOESN'T COMPUTE.

17:12.890 --> 17:14.551
- WELL, THEN, WE NEED
TO HURRY, SHAWN,

17:14.600 --> 17:16.556
BECAUSE TROUT IS TRIGGER-HAPPY
AND IN RARE FORM.

17:16.600 --> 17:18.090
WE HAVE TO STALL HIM
FROM GOING DOWN THERE.

17:18.130 --> 17:20.394
- OKAY, BUT NOBODY
LIKES A NAG, JULES.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.064
- BOOM.

17:24.110 --> 17:25.407
IN MY OFFICE!

17:25.440 --> 17:27.408

17:27.440 --> 17:29.829
[grunting]

17:29.880 --> 17:31.279
WHEW.

17:31.310 --> 17:31.969
- ALL RIGHT, DON'T SIT.

17:32.010 --> 17:34.274
- WAIT, SIT.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.517
NO, ONE OF YOU, SIT.

17:37.550 --> 17:40.758
NO, NOT THE WHITE ONE.
- OKAY.

17:40.790 --> 17:42.257
- ALL RIGHT, MIND GIANTS.

17:42.290 --> 17:44.952
GIVE IT TO ME.
WHAT'D YOU SEE DOWN THERE?

17:44.990 --> 17:47.049
VU LN ERABLE SPOTS,
ACCESS POINTS?

17:47.100 --> 17:49.557

A BUNCH OF SCALPELS,

17:49.600 --> 17:51.921
AND,UHn
OH, OH!

17:51.970 --> 17:53.665
A TUNA FISH SANDWICH
WITH CELERY.

17:53.700 --> 17:55.292
- I NEVER UNDERSTOOD CELERY
IN TUNA SALAD.

17:55.340 --> 17:56.637
- THANK YOU, EXACTLY.

17:56.670 --> 17:58.262
PICKLES, MAN.

17:58.310 --> 17:59.800
GIVES YOU THE SAME CRUNCH,
GIVES YOU THE SAME TEXTURE,

17:59.840 --> 18:01.637
BUT DOESN'T TASTE
LIKE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

18:01.680 --> 18:02.738
- WHAT'S YOUR THOUGHT ON EGG?
- I'M PASSIONATE.

18:02.780 --> 18:03.804
HOW MUCH TIME YOU GOT?

18:03.850 --> 18:06.273
- MOVE PAST THE SANDWICH!

18:06.310 --> 18:07.811
MOVE PAST THE SANDWICH.

18:07.850 --> 18:09.169
- OKAY.

18:09.220 --> 18:10.539
I'M PRETTY SURE
I SAW A BLACK GUY.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.114
- THAT WAS ME.
- NO.

18:12.150 --> 18:13.913
THIS GUY WAS SUPER EFFEMINATE.
- [clicks tongue]

18:13.960 --> 18:15.188
- OKAY, YOU GUYS
ARE TRULY USELESS.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.881
NOW GET UP
AND GET OUT OF MY OFFICE.

18:16.920 --> 18:17.955
YOU'RE DISMISSED.

18:17.990 --> 18:19.651
- SURE THING.

18:19.690 --> 18:21.021
- BUT TO BE FAIR, SIR,
I DON'T THINK

18:21.060 --> 18:22.857
EITHER ONE OF US
FULLY SAT DOWN.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.822
- WELL SAID.

18:28.670 --> 18:30.661
- O'HARA!
I THOUGHT ABOUT IT!

18:30.710 --> 18:32.701
BRING ME

18:32.740 --> 18:34.731

18:34.780 --> 18:39.103
I'VE, UH, GOT
YOUR HOSTAGE'S PILLS HERE.

18:39.150 --> 18:40.071
I WANT TO TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE,

18:40.110 --> 18:41.975
MAN-TO-MAN, ALL RIGHT?

18:42.020 --> 18:44.284
NOW, I KNOW
YOU'RE HURTING, OKAY?

18:44.320 --> 18:46.914
BUT I'M NOT JUST
SOME ROOKIE COP, OKAY?

18:46.950 --> 18:48.815
I USED TO BE HEAD DETECTIVE
OF THIS MONKEY FACTORY,

18:48.860 --> 18:50.282
AND I STILL GOT
SOME JUICE.

18:50.330 --> 18:52.252
SO WHAT DO YOU SAY
YOU LET ME COME IN THERE,

18:52.290 --> 18:54.292
AND WE CAN BE HEROES
TOGETHER ON THIS THING, HUH?

18:54.330 --> 18:56.195

19:00.670 --> 19:04.709
- MAN.

19:04.740 --> 19:06.605
TRYING TO HELP YOU OUT.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.447
- OKAY.
- CAN I GET UP NOW?

19:17.620 --> 19:19.247
- HEY, UH, I JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU

19:19.290 --> 19:21.155
FOR HAVING A CHANGE OF HEART
ABOUT WOODY'S MEDICATION.

19:21.190 --> 19:24.887
- YEAH, I GUESS
YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.

19:24.930 --> 19:26.488
ALL RIGHT,
TURN ME ON, PLEASE.

19:26.530 --> 19:27.656
[typing]

19:33.130 --> 19:35.234
OKAY, WE'RE IN.

19:37.570 --> 19:39.231
- WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOU'RE IN?

19:39.270 --> 19:40.669
- I HAVE A VISUAL.

19:40.710 --> 19:41.836
SOMEONE GET ME A SHOOTER
IN PLACE.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.006
NICE WORK, O'HARA.
- WHOA!

19:43.040 --> 19:44.507
WHAT ABOUT WOODY?

19:44.550 --> 19:45.244
- WHAT, YOUR CORONER
WHO LOST A FORK

19:45.280 --> 19:46.804
INSIDE OF TWO BODIES?

19:46.850 --> 19:49.876
YEAH, HE MIGHT NOT
SURVIVE THIS.

19:52.950 --> 19:55.259
[knock at door]

20:00.930 --> 20:02.192
- [Latino accent]
WHAT'S UP, HOMES?

20:02.230 --> 20:05.199
I'M EMILIO ESTEVEZ ESTEVEZ.

20:05.230 --> 20:07.289
JUST GOT OUT OF LOCKDOWN
FOR SOME ARMED ROBBERY.

20:07.340 --> 20:08.967
THIS DUDE HERE, HE'S--

20:09.000 --> 20:10.194
- BREAK YOURSELF, FOOL!

20:10.240 --> 20:11.867
I JUST GOT
OUT OF LOCKDOWN TOO.

20:11.910 --> 20:13.798
- THAT'S RIGHT, HOMES.
WAIT.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.307
NO, YOU DIDN'T.
- YES, I DID.

20:15.340 --> 20:18.605
- YOU MOST CERTAINLY DID NOT.
- YES, I DID.

20:18.650 --> 20:22.279
- ONE SECOND, VATO.
ONE.

20:22.320 --> 20:23.810
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

20:23.850 --> 20:25.386
MY PAROLE OFFICER.
- I CALLED AN AUDIBLE.

20:25.420 --> 20:26.910
- YOU CAN'T CALL AN AUDIBLE.
WE ONLY HAVE ONE PLAY.

20:26.950 --> 20:28.281
- WHY DO YOU ALWAYS GET
TO BE THE CRIMINAL?

20:28.320 --> 20:30.015
I WANT TO BE OFFENSIVE TOO.

20:30.060 --> 20:31.379
- WHAT KIND OF CRIMINAL
WEARS SLACKS

20:31.430 --> 20:32.385
AND TUCKS HIS SHIRT
INTO HIS UNDERWEAR?

20:32.430 --> 20:34.250
- A BLACK COLLAR CRIMINAL.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.949
- THERE'S NO SUCH THING.
- IT'S LIKE WHITE COLLAR,

20:36.000 --> 20:38.525
ONLY BLACKER, AND YOU WEREN'T
IN MAGIC MIKE.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.128
- WHAT IF WOODY JUST DIED?

20:40.170 --> 20:42.035
JUST NOW,
BECAUSE OF THIS NONSENSE?

20:42.070 --> 20:43.139
- I'D HAVE REGRETS.
- YEAH.

20:43.170 --> 20:46.230
TIGHTEN IT UP, MAN!

20:46.270 --> 20:48.204
- I'M SORRY.
THERE WAS SOME CONFUSION.

20:48.240 --> 20:50.743
I'M REALLY HIS P.O.
I WAS TESTING YOU.

20:50.780 --> 20:52.577
YOU PASSED.

20:52.610 --> 20:55.170
NOW, I NEED A ROOM FOR
THIS LOW-LIFE PIECE OF TRASH.

20:55.220 --> 20:56.812
- YES, SIR.

20:56.850 --> 20:58.078
USUALLY, YOU GOT TO TALK
TO MAURICE.

20:58.120 --> 20:59.314
HE RUNS THE PLACE.

20:59.350 --> 21:00.817
BUT HE'S NOT IN RIGHT NOW,

21:00.860 --> 21:02.851
SO HE LEI-T ME IN CHARGE.

21:02.890 --> 21:04.357
MY NAME'S ROCCO.
- OH.

21:04.390 --> 21:05.948
- COME ON IN.
I'LL SHOW YOU AROUND.

21:05.990 --> 21:08.197
- COME ON.

21:08.230 --> 21:10.198
- [speaking Spanish]

21:10.230 --> 21:12.698
- NO OFFENSE, ROCCO,
BUT ISN'T LEAVING YOU IN CHARGE

21:12.730 --> 21:14.391
LIKE LETTING THE FOX
GUARD THE HEN HOUSE?

21:14.440 --> 21:17.307
- OR JAMIE FOXX GUARD
THE RECORDING STUDIO.

21:17.340 --> 21:19.808
- MAURICE LIKES TO GIVE US
DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES

21:19.840 --> 21:21.068
AROUND THE HOUSE.
- HMM.

21:21.110 --> 21:22.839
- SAYS IT HELPS US
RE-ASSIMILATE.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.074
MAKES YOUR JOB EASIER.

21:24.110 --> 21:26.977
- [sniffing]

21:27.010 --> 21:28.318
- IT'S A TIGHT SHIP.

21:28.350 --> 21:30.739
WE ALL GOTTA DO CHORES,
GET JOBS,

21:30.790 --> 21:32.917
KEEP A 9:00 PM. CURFEW
AND, UH...

21:37.190 --> 21:39.329
- DAMN, THIS PLACE
IS WORSE THAN THE JOINT,

21:39.360 --> 21:40.793
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING, HOMES?

21:40.830 --> 21:42.127
- HEY, MAN.

21:42.160 --> 21:44.196
LET ME HOLLER AT YOU
FOR A MINUTE.

21:44.230 --> 21:47.119
YOU GOT TO COME UP
OUT OF THOSE SHOES, HOMEY.

21:47.170 --> 21:48.990
- MY ZAPATOS?
- YEAH.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.928
YOU SEE, THAT'S HOW I RUN THINGS
UP IN HERE.

21:50.970 --> 21:53.063
[rap music]

21:53.110 --> 21:55.101
- [exhales]

21:55.140 --> 21:57.643
- DUDE, I KNEW
I SMELLED VENISON!

21:57.680 --> 22:00.205
- THAT GUY TOOK MY SHOES.
- WHA--

22:00.250 --> 22:02.138
QUIT PLAYING, SHAWN.

22:02.180 --> 22:03.408
WHAT IF WOODY WOULD HAVE DIED,
JUST NOW, BECAUSE OF THAT?

22:03.450 --> 22:05.088
- DO I LOOK LIKE I'M PLAYING?

22:05.120 --> 22:06.280
AND JULES GOT ME THOSE SNEAKS.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.015
I'M GONNA GET IN TROUBLE.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.914
AND I DON'T THINK ROCCO
IS AS RE-ASSIMILATED

22:09.960 --> 22:12.781
AS HE PRETENDS TO BE.
MATTER OF FACT...

22:12.830 --> 22:14.457
I THINK HE'S OUR KILLER.
- [clicks tongue]

22:14.500 --> 22:15.990
TIGHTEN IT UP.
- [clicks tongue]

22:16.030 --> 22:17.497
- YEAH,
YOU CAN GO ON UPSTAIRS.

22:17.530 --> 22:19.566
MY ROOM IS THE FIRST ROOM
UPSTAIRS ON THE LEI-T.

22:19.600 --> 22:22.467
IT'S THE ONLY ONE AVAILABLE.

22:22.500 --> 22:26.231
MY ROOMIE, WILSON,
WAS FOUND DEAD THIS MORNING.

22:26.270 --> 22:28.079
- OH, YEAH?

22:28.110 --> 22:30.169
YOU DON'T SEEM TOO BROKEN UP
ABOUT IT, HOMES.

22:30.210 --> 22:32.849
- YOU GET
WHAT'S COMING TO YOU.

22:32.880 --> 22:35.974
- OKAY, WHAT ARE WE
LOOKING FOR?

22:36.020 --> 22:39.444
- ANY EVIDENCE THAT WILSON
AND ROCCO WERE HAVING A BEEF.

22:50.500 --> 22:54.231
MAN, ROCCO WASN'T LYING WHEN HE
SAID MAURICE RUNS A TIGHT SHIP.

22:54.270 --> 22:57.239
HE MADE THESE GUYS
REPORT EVERYTHING.

22:57.270 --> 22:58.999
- DUDE, LOOKS LIKE WILSON
WAS TRYING

22:59.040 --> 23:02.134
TO GET HIS LIFE TOGETHER
BEFORE HE DIED.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.042
- NO.

23:10.080 --> 23:12.048
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE IS THAT

23:12.090 --> 23:15.082
WILSON WAS STICKING A FILE
INTO CYRUS' WIFE'S CAKE.

23:15.120 --> 23:17.680
- OKAY, OKAY, I WAS HAVING
A RELATIONSHIP WITH GREER,

23:17.730 --> 23:19.721
BUT I CALLED IT OFF AS SOON
AS I FOUND OUT HE WENT BACK

23:19.760 --> 23:22.149
TO DOING THE THINGS THAT GOT HIM
ARRESTED IN THE FIRST PLACE.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.690
- OH, SO LET ME GET
THIS STRAIGHT.

23:23.730 --> 23:25.197
THE PERSON
YOU WERE ADULTERATING WITH

23:25.230 --> 23:26.390
DIDN'T LIVE UP
TO YOUR STANDARDS?

23:26.430 --> 23:28.136
- EXACTLY.
IT WAS DANGEROUS.

23:28.170 --> 23:29.364
HE WAS GOING IN AND OUT
AT ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT,

23:29.400 --> 23:31.903
DOING GOD KNOWS WHAT
WITH BAD PEOPLE.

23:31.940 --> 23:35.000
- LIKE ADULTERERS?

23:35.040 --> 23:37.031
- IT'S A TIGHT SHIP.
WE ALL GOTTA DO CHORES,

23:37.080 --> 23:39.344
GET JOBS,
KEEP A 9:00 PM. CURFEW.

23:39.380 --> 23:42.247
- NOW, WHY WOULD MAURICE LET
WILSON BREAK THE HOUSE CURFEW?

23:42.280 --> 23:43.838
- WHO THE HELL IS MAURICE?

23:43.890 --> 23:45.141
- MAURICE RUNS
THE HALFWAY HOUSE.

23:45.190 --> 23:46.384
- GUS WRITES LETTERS
TO MEN IN PRISON.

23:46.420 --> 23:48.012
- WHAT?
- OKAY, I'M ALREADY BORED.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.516
- WE NEED TO GO BACK THERE,
SHAWN.

23:49.560 --> 23:51.983
WE NEED TO FIND MAURICE.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.196
- [Latino accent]
YO, MAURICE!

23:59.230 --> 24:01.130
WE KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE, MAN!

24:01.170 --> 24:04.003
STOP PLAYING
WITH OUR EMOTIONS!

24:07.940 --> 24:09.578
MAURICE!

24:09.610 --> 24:12.044
COME ON, ESE!
- WE KNOW THAT YOU'RE HERE,

24:12.080 --> 24:14.116
BECAUSE THE FOLKS INSIDE SAID
THAT IF YOU WEREN'T

24:14.150 --> 24:15.708
AT THE STORE,
YOU'D BE OUT HERE

24:15.750 --> 24:17.115
BECAUSE YOU LIKE TO WORK ON--

24:17.150 --> 24:19.141
- DUDE, I THINK HE GETS IT.

24:19.190 --> 24:21.613
- I'M JUST TRYING TO LET HIM
KNOW THAT WE'RE ONTO HIM.

24:21.660 --> 24:24.254
WE'RE ONTO YOU, MAURICE!
MO!

24:24.290 --> 24:26.349
- COME ON, ESE!
- MO!

24:26.390 --> 24:29.052
- COME ON OUT
AND TALK TO US LIKE MEN!

24:29.100 --> 24:31.193
THIS IS SOME NONSENSE.

24:31.230 --> 24:35.166
[both grunt]

24:35.200 --> 24:38.260
[speaking Spanish]

24:38.310 --> 24:42.076
- MAN, NOW WE HAVE TO CLEAR
CYRUS OF TWO MURDERS.

24:42.110 --> 24:45.307
- THAT'S HOW I RUN THINGS
UP IN HERE.

24:45.350 --> 24:48.569
- DUDE, I BET YOU
IT'S THAT TWO-FACED ROCCO.

24:48.620 --> 24:50.918
GOT TIRED OF LIVING
UNDER MAURICE'S RULES...

24:50.950 --> 24:52.918
KILLED HIM.
[wheels rolling]

24:52.950 --> 24:54.486
UH-OH.

24:54.520 --> 24:56.988
MAURICE!
STOP FARTING AROUND, MAN!

24:57.020 --> 24:58.885
- WILL YOU STOP TALKING
LIKE THAT?

25:00.660 --> 25:03.220
- OKAY, BOYS, TIME TO GEAR UP.
LET'S GO, COME ON!

25:03.260 --> 25:05.421
- UM, SIR, MIGHTI REMIND YOU
THAT WE HAVE

25:05.470 --> 25:08.132
YET TO TRY ANY OF
OUR LESS AGGRESSIVE PROTOCOLS?

25:08.170 --> 25:09.660
- AH, DETECTIVE O'HARA,
WHEN I WANT YOUR OPINION,

25:09.700 --> 25:12.760
I'LL RENT CHARLIE'S ANGELS.

25:13.910 --> 25:15.275
- WELL, THIS DOESN'T LOOK GOOD,

25:15.310 --> 25:17.198
DOES IT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

25:17.240 --> 25:20.175
I'M GETTING A BULLETPROOF VEST
JUST IN CASE.

25:20.210 --> 25:22.678
- UH, CAN I GET ONE TOO?

25:23.720 --> 25:25.415
- HEY, HOW'S IT GOING UP THERE?

25:25.450 --> 25:27.338
- TROUT'S NOT OPEN
TO ANY OF MY SUGGESTIONS.

25:27.390 --> 25:30.359
I ACTUALLY THINK HE'S WILLING
TO SACRIFICE WOODY TO END THIS.

25:30.390 --> 25:32.358
- NAH, I MEAN, TROUT'S CRAZY,
BUT HE'S NOT THAT CRAZY.

25:32.390 --> 25:34.153
- HE IS.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.258
I LOOKED UP THAT HOSTAGE
SITUATION IN POUGHKEEPSIE,

25:35.300 --> 25:37.222
THE ONE HE KEEPS BRAGGING ABOUT?

25:37.260 --> 25:42.163
FOUR CASUALTIES--THE BAD GUY,
TWO CIVILIANS, AND AN OFFICER.

25:42.200 --> 25:43.394
- IT WASN'T THE OFFICER
GUARDING THE DOOR, WAS IT?

25:43.440 --> 25:45.101
- OH. [sighs]

25:45.140 --> 25:46.630
- OKAY, LOOK,
IT'S YOUR CALL, O'HARA.

25:46.670 --> 25:50.037
I'LL DO WHATEVER I CAN
FROM DOWN HERE.

25:50.080 --> 25:52.071
- [sighs]

25:59.390 --> 26:01.483
- STOP FIDGETING.
- SORRY.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.579
I'M JUST GETTING
THESE HOT FLASHES.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.780
- THEY KILLED THE A/C.
- [sighs] THANK GOD.

26:05.830 --> 26:07.252
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING
THROUGH MALE MENOPAUSE.

26:07.290 --> 26:08.552
I MEAN,
I'VE GOT ALL THE SYMPTOMS.

26:08.600 --> 26:10.352
I'M SWEATY,
MY CHEEKS ARE FLUSHED,

26:10.400 --> 26:11.799
MY NIPPLES HAVE BEEN
REALLY TENDER.

26:11.830 --> 26:15.231
- HEY, CYRUS!
WOODY'S DAUGHTER IS HERE!

26:15.270 --> 26:17.966
- NO, I CAN'T LET YOU
SEE HER.

26:18.010 --> 26:20.672
- LOOK, I HAVE BEEN
A GOOD SPORT.

26:20.710 --> 26:23.338
IF THIS THING IS GOING TO END
LIKE I FEAR IT MIGHT,

26:23.380 --> 26:25.109
CAN YOU AT LEAST--

26:25.150 --> 26:28.039
COME ON, LET ME SAY GOOD-BYE
TO MY LITTLE GIRL.

26:29.320 --> 26:32.687
- OKAY.
ONE MINUTE.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.915
OKAY, COME ON IN.

26:38.630 --> 26:40.257
- HI, DAD.

26:42.900 --> 26:43.889
- CYRUS, THANK YOU FOR THIS.

26:43.930 --> 26:45.124
I FEEL LIKE I OWE YOU SOMETHING.

26:45.170 --> 26:46.364
MAYBE A NICE V-NECK?

26:46.400 --> 26:48.732
- [scoffs]
JUST MAKE IT QUICK.

26:50.940 --> 26:53.738
- HI.
OH.

26:53.780 --> 26:55.475
- WHAT THE HELL
IS SHE DOING DOWN THERE?

26:55.510 --> 26:58.274
- NOW, IF I, IN ANY WAY,
LED YOU TO BELIEVE

26:58.310 --> 27:00.301
THAT I AM YOUR FATHER--
- WOODY!

27:00.350 --> 27:02.545
THIS IS A PLAN LASSIE AND I CAME
UP WITH TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE.

27:02.580 --> 27:05.219
YOU HAVE TO PLAY ALONG.
- OW.

27:07.090 --> 27:10.548
both: OH.

27:10.590 --> 27:14.492
- SWEETIE.
[both laughing]

27:14.530 --> 27:16.623
- LASSITER!
HOW DID SHE GET PAST YOU?

27:16.660 --> 27:18.525
HOW DID THAT HAPPEN?

27:18.570 --> 27:20.367
- I'M SORRY, SIR.
THAT'S ONE OF OUR OWN IN THERE.

27:20.400 --> 27:22.061
WE HAD TO TAKE A CHANCE
ON A PLAN THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY

27:22.100 --> 27:23.636
GET HIM OUT ALIVE.
- NO, NO!

27:23.670 --> 27:26.264
NOW YOUR PLAN MIGHT GET BOTH
OF THEM INJURED OR SHOT,

27:26.310 --> 27:28.801
BECAUSE MY PLAN
IS STILL THE SAME!

27:28.840 --> 27:31.775
AND ALL THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN
BECAUSE YOU DEFIED MY ORDERS!

27:33.850 --> 27:36.614
- SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

27:36.650 --> 27:40.142
- YOU KNOW.

27:40.190 --> 27:41.487
- NO, NO, I DON'T.

27:41.520 --> 27:43.454
THAT--THAT IS WHY I ASKED.

27:43.490 --> 27:46.254
SO, WHAT'S GOING ON?
SPILL. [laughs]

27:46.290 --> 27:51.489
- UH, WELL, UM, THINGS ARE
PRETTY MUCH THE SAME, I GUESS.

27:51.530 --> 27:53.293
- UH-HUH.
- YOU KNOW?

27:53.330 --> 27:54.297
- YOU'RE NOT GREAT
AT THIS IMPROV THING, ARE YOU?

27:54.340 --> 27:57.707
- I AM NOT GREAT AT THIS.

27:57.740 --> 27:59.401
- WE MAY BE LOOKING
AT A SECOND MURDER WEAPON?

27:59.440 --> 28:00.600
I DON'T KNOW, GUS.

28:00.640 --> 28:02.699
DEFINITELY MISSING SOMETHING.

28:08.450 --> 28:09.769
YES!

28:09.820 --> 28:10.844
- WHAT, YOU FOUND
A MURDER WEAPON?

28:10.890 --> 28:13.688
- NO, I FOUND MY SHOES, DUDE.

28:16.220 --> 28:17.721
WHAT DID YOU JUST TAKE?
- NOTHING.

28:17.760 --> 28:20.149
JUST SOME TICKETS.
- WHAT KIND OF TICKETS?

28:20.190 --> 28:21.589
- LOTTERY TICKETS.
QUICK PICK.

28:21.630 --> 28:24.269
- SHAME ON YOU.
- SHAWN, THE DUDE IS DEAD.

28:24.300 --> 28:25.562
HE'S NOT GONNA BE PLAYING
THE GAME ANYMORE.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.160
- GIVE 'EM UP.
- [clicks tongue] MAN.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.237
- GIVE 'EM UP!
- HERE.

28:39.050 --> 28:41.871
- STAY WITHIN 10 MILES
OF THE HOUSE AT ALL TIMES, SIR.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.309
- HE WAS GOING IN AND OUT
AT ALL HOURS OF THE NIGHT.

28:44.350 --> 28:45.385
- WAIT A MINUTE.

28:45.420 --> 28:47.047
THESE WERE ALL BOUGHT AT A STORE

28:47.090 --> 28:48.751
THAT IS DEFINITELY MORE
THAN 10 MILES FROM HERE, GUS.

28:48.790 --> 28:52.180
AND ALL AFTER 9:00 PM.

28:52.230 --> 28:55.051
THAT'S THE PART OF TOWN
HE WAS GOING TO.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.861
- SO THAT'S CONDOMS.

28:57.900 --> 29:01.597
- I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW
WE GOT ON THIS TOPIC,

29:01.640 --> 29:04.666
BUT I AM WAY PAST
THE BIRDS AND THE BEES.

29:04.710 --> 29:07.668
- WHEN YOU GET AROUND BOYS,
DO YOU SOMETIMES GET NERVOUS?

29:07.710 --> 29:10.008
CLAMMY PALMS?
THAT IS NORMAL.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.578
NOW, THERE ARE CHANGES
THAT WILL OCCUR IN YOUR---

29:13.610 --> 29:14.679
YOUR SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE.

29:14.720 --> 29:16.312
- OH, MY GOD.
- HEY.

29:16.350 --> 29:19.683
THIS IS NOT WITCHCRAFl'.
- [laughs nervously]

29:19.720 --> 29:23.451
- OKAY, SWEETIE?
- EWW, NO, NO, NO.

29:23.490 --> 29:25.219
NO.

29:25.260 --> 29:26.557
- YEAH.

29:26.590 --> 29:29.593
IT'S A TOUCHING
FAMILY REUNION,

29:29.630 --> 29:32.861
BUT MY LIFE IS AT STAKE HERE!
- [clears throat]

29:32.900 --> 29:34.231
- LET ME HELP YOU.

29:34.270 --> 29:36.636
- DON'T TOUCH ME!

29:36.670 --> 29:37.762
STOP!

29:37.810 --> 29:39.607
DON'T TOUCH THE BODY.

29:39.640 --> 29:41.107
- YOU SHOULD BE
LETTING ME TOUCH IT.

29:41.140 --> 29:43.233
NOT IN A WEIRD WAY--THAT,

29:43.280 --> 29:45.202
BASED ON OUR EARLIER TALK,
WOULD NOT BE NORMAL--

29:45.250 --> 29:48.515
I MEAN, IN A MEDICAL,
SCIENTIFIC WAY.

29:48.550 --> 29:50.518
LET ME PERFORM THE AUTOPSY.

29:50.550 --> 29:52.689
- [scoffs]
WHAT GOOD WOULD IT DO?

29:52.720 --> 29:54.585
- I'M ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD
AT WHAT I DO.

29:54.620 --> 29:56.019
IF THERE ARE CLUES IN THIS BODY
THAT WILL LEAD

29:56.060 --> 29:57.880
TO SOMEONE ELSE AND NOT YOU,

29:57.930 --> 30:00.251
I'M THE ONLY PERSON
WHO'S GOING TO FIND THEM.

30:00.290 --> 30:02.724
- HE IS REALLY GOOD.

30:02.760 --> 30:05.228
- YOU'RE HIS DAUGHTER.
OF COURSE YOU'RE GONNA SAY THAT.

30:05.270 --> 30:07.625
- WHAT OTHER OPTIONS
DO YOU HAVE?

30:07.670 --> 30:10.264
UNTIE ME.
LET ME FREE!

30:10.300 --> 30:13.235
TAKE A CHANCE ON ME!

30:17.410 --> 30:19.344
- OKAY.

30:21.180 --> 30:24.445
BUT YOU GOT ONE SHOT, OKAY?

30:24.490 --> 30:26.481
AND YOU, OUT OF HERE.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.078
YOU KNOW,
VISITATION TIME IS OVER.

30:28.120 --> 30:29.656
COME ON.
- OKAY.

30:31.930 --> 30:35.229
- UH, YOU KNOW, ACTUALLY,
I THINK SHE SHOULD STAY.

30:35.260 --> 30:37.296
I THINK SHE SHOULD STAY
AND ASSIST ME.

30:37.330 --> 30:38.820
SHE ACTUALLY IS TAKING
AFTER HER OLD DAD,

30:38.870 --> 30:40.690
AND SHE IS BECOMING
A CORONER TOO.

30:40.730 --> 30:43.858
SHE IS NUMBER ONE
IN HER FORENSICS CLASS.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.400
BRILLIANT, GENI--
- WELL, I MEAN,

30:45.440 --> 30:46.668
THAT'S KIND OF
AN EXAGGERATION.

30:46.710 --> 30:49.338
IT'S A VERY,
VERY SMALL CLASS.

30:49.380 --> 30:51.473
- NOW--NOW SHE'S BEING MODEST.
STRODE FAMILY TRAIT.

30:51.510 --> 30:54.047
- DAD, STOP.
- NO, I WILL NOT!

30:54.080 --> 30:55.945
I LOVE YOU,
AND I'M PROUD OF YOU.

30:55.980 --> 30:58.517
SHE'S BRILLIANT.
SPECIALIZES IN FLUIDS.

30:58.550 --> 31:03.419
- I'M GONNA WATCH
EVERY SINGLE MOVE, OKAY?

31:05.360 --> 31:07.851
- WE'RE UP TO IT.

31:11.700 --> 31:13.463
- YEAH, I RECOGNIZE HIM.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.139
HE WOULD BUY QUICK PICKS
ALL THE TIME.

31:16.170 --> 31:17.364
NEVER HIT THE BIG ONE,
THOUGH.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.004
- MM.
- AW.

31:19.040 --> 31:20.029
SPEAKING OF WHICH, DO YOU MIND
CHECKING THESE, PLEASE?

31:20.070 --> 31:22.038
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME RIGHT NOW?

31:22.080 --> 31:24.799
- SINCE WILSON WAS MURDERED,
HE'S DUE SOME GOOD LUCK NOW.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.647
AT LEAST
THAT'S WHAT MATH SAYS.

31:26.680 --> 31:29.649
- WOULD YOU PLEASE STOP QUOTING
MATH LIKE IT IS A PERSON?

31:29.680 --> 31:30.988
NEXT YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
THAT MATH IS BLACK.

31:31.020 --> 31:32.988
- [laughs]
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS, SON.

31:33.020 --> 31:35.853
VERB IS BLACK.
- VERB IS NOT--

31:35.890 --> 31:37.255
VERB IS BLACK.
- TOLD YOU.

31:37.290 --> 31:40.123
VERB.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.650
- SORRY.
- AW.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.224
- DO YOU REMEMBER SEEING WILSON
WITH ANYONE ELSE?

31:43.260 --> 31:45.899
- NOPE.
ALWAYS ALONE.

31:45.930 --> 31:48.194
- ANOTHER DEAD END.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.595
- [grunts]

31:50.640 --> 31:52.801
- OH. [laughs]
NOW SHE'S GETTING SHY.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.535
WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL,
YOU WERE ALL,

31:54.580 --> 31:55.774
"OH, DADDY, LET ME TOUCH
THE DEAD MAN'S PANCREAS."

31:55.810 --> 31:57.368
- [laughs nervously]

31:57.410 --> 31:58.672
- THEN YOUR MOTHER
TURNED YOU AGAINST ME.

31:58.710 --> 32:01.577
IS THAT WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

32:04.620 --> 32:07.817
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
[screams]

32:07.850 --> 32:09.556
[clattering]

32:09.590 --> 32:11.785
- WE LOST VISUAL!

32:11.830 --> 32:14.458
WE LOST THE VISUAL!

32:16.330 --> 32:19.128
- REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU?

32:19.170 --> 32:22.469
I'I'M GONNA SHOOT THE NEXT COP
THAT COMES DOWN HERE.‘I

32:24.670 --> 32:26.706
- WE'RE GOING IN.

32:26.740 --> 32:30.608
- HEY, LISTEN, BEFORE OR AFTER
YOU SHOOT DETECTIVE O'HARA--

32:30.640 --> 32:32.505
BUT PREFERABLY
BEFORE YOU SHOOT ME--

32:32.550 --> 32:35.246
CAN I PLEASE JUST--
JUST SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

32:35.280 --> 32:36.440
- HEY.
- UH-UH.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.084
- WHAT?

32:42.690 --> 32:44.521
- THIS COLOR CHANGE INDICATES

32:44.560 --> 32:48.599
THE PRESENCE OF TRACES
OF SULFURIC ACID.

32:48.630 --> 32:50.655
SULFURIC ACID IS NOT
A COMMON HOUSEHOLD PRODUCT.

32:50.700 --> 32:53.089
THIS AMOUNT IN THE WOUNDS
IS GOOD REASON TO BELIEVE

32:53.130 --> 32:55.291
THAT THE MURDER DID NOT
TAKE PLACE IN YOUR HOUSE.

32:55.340 --> 32:59.037
THIS COULD CLEAR YOU
OF ALL CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE.

33:02.480 --> 33:05.938
[musical ringtone]

33:05.980 --> 33:07.743
- WOODY, TALK TO ME.
- SHAWN...

33:07.780 --> 33:09.042
JULIET AND I FOUND SOMETHING.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.809
- JULIET?
WHAT ARE YOU--

33:10.850 --> 33:12.442
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT IS SHE DOING THERE?

33:12.490 --> 33:14.811
- UH, WELL, SHE WAS PRETENDING
TO BE MY DAUGHTER.

33:14.860 --> 33:16.213
SHE HAS A COLON IN HER HAND.

33:16.260 --> 33:18.023
LONG STORY SHORT, I FOUND

33:18.060 --> 33:21.552
A TRACE OF SULFURIC ACID
IN GREER WILSON'S WOUNDS.

33:21.600 --> 33:23.693
- DO I HAVE ANY IDEA
WHAT SULFURIC ACID IS?

33:23.730 --> 33:25.095
- [clicks tongue]
- THAT'S ALL I GOT, SHAWN.

33:25.130 --> 33:27.269
WE REALLY NEED YOU
TO MAKE THIS WORK.

33:28.470 --> 33:29.835
- [sighs]

33:29.870 --> 33:31.701
SHE'S GOT A COLON IN HER HAND.
- WHAT?

33:31.740 --> 33:33.059
- LOOK, WE KNOW GREER
WAS HERE, RIGHT?

33:33.110 --> 33:35.408
THE QUESTION IS,
WHAT WAS HE UP TO?

33:35.440 --> 33:37.476
[sighs]

33:44.020 --> 33:45.578
WHAT THE HELL
WAS GREER DOING

33:45.620 --> 33:47.042
HANGING SIGNS
ALL THE WAY OUT HERE?

33:47.090 --> 33:48.580
- WHATEVER IS BACK THERE,

33:48.620 --> 33:51.453
HE DIDN'T WANT ANYBODY
TO FIND IT.

33:59.500 --> 34:02.594
- [grunting] OH.

34:02.640 --> 34:03.664
- IT'S LOWER THAN
I THOUGHT IT WAS.

34:03.700 --> 34:06.965
[both grunting]

34:07.010 --> 34:08.500
- THIS IS JUST FILTHY.

34:08.540 --> 34:09.677
OH!

34:09.710 --> 34:11.541
[both screaming]

34:11.580 --> 34:13.673
[thud, thud]
[both panting]

34:13.710 --> 34:15.041
- I'M GONNA KILL YOU, SHAWN.

34:15.080 --> 34:16.547
- [grunts loudly]

34:16.580 --> 34:19.185
[both grunting]
- OH, GOD.

34:19.220 --> 34:22.053
- WHAT IS THIS PLACE?
IT SMELLS LIKE YOUR APARTMENT.

34:32.030 --> 34:34.567
- DUDE, THEY MADE
FERTILIZER HERE.

34:34.600 --> 34:36.761
- GUS, I DO NOT HAVE TIME
FOR ENCYCLOPEDIA BROWN.

34:36.800 --> 34:37.937
THE CLOCK IS TICKING, OKAY?

34:37.970 --> 34:39.665
WE'VE GOTTA SOLVE THIS CASE!

34:39.710 --> 34:42.770
- SULFURIC ACID IS USED
TO MAKE FERTILIZER, SHAWN.

34:42.810 --> 34:44.141
WOODY JUST TOLD YOU
ON THE PHONE

34:44.180 --> 34:45.670
THAT HE FOUND SULFURIC ACID
ON THE BODY.

34:45.710 --> 34:46.938
- THAT WAS TODAY?
- OH, MY GOSH.

34:46.980 --> 34:49.369
- THAT MEANS WILSON
WAS HERE, GUS!

34:56.060 --> 34:58.688
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

35:01.630 --> 35:04.360
- SIGNS OF A STRUGGLE.

35:05.830 --> 35:08.663
- [grunts]

35:08.700 --> 35:11.032
- BLOOD!

35:11.070 --> 35:13.106
DUDE, THIS IS
WHERE HE WAS KILLED.

35:15.040 --> 35:16.974
- WHOEVER KILLED HIM
WOULD HAVE BEEN EXPOSED

35:17.010 --> 35:18.671
TO THE SAME SULFURIC ACID
WOODY FOUND ON WILSON'S BODY.

35:18.710 --> 35:20.598
- DO NOT TEASE ME,
REBBIE JACKSON.

35:20.650 --> 35:23.574
- HE'D SHOW SIGNS OF BLISTERING,
SCARRING, DISCOLORATION.

35:26.290 --> 35:29.612
- OH, MY GOD.
I GOTTA CALL LASSIE.

35:29.660 --> 35:32.823
- [whispering] FALL IN.
[phone vibrating]

35:32.860 --> 35:36.091
[beep]
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

35:36.130 --> 35:37.825
- SPENCER, YOU BETTER
MAKE THIS GOOD.

35:37.860 --> 35:39.361
THEY'RE GETTING READY
TO GO IN AS WE SPEAK.

35:39.400 --> 35:42.460
- I KNOW WHO DID IT,
AND THEY'RE IN THE STATION.

35:44.140 --> 35:47.109
[indistinct radio chatter]

35:47.140 --> 35:49.131
- ALL RIGHT, COME ON, GUYS.
FALL IN.

36:06.890 --> 36:09.597
- FREEZE!

36:09.630 --> 36:11.188
EDWARD TRIPP,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST

36:11.230 --> 36:13.528
FOR THE MURDERS OF GREER WILSON
AND MAURICE NIGHT.

36:13.570 --> 36:16.437
- ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

36:21.140 --> 36:23.176
[phone vibrates]

36:28.150 --> 36:29.845
[doors busts open]

36:29.880 --> 36:31.848
- OH!

36:37.120 --> 36:38.929
- STAND DOWN, DETECTIVE.

36:38.960 --> 36:40.120
- OKAY, TROUT, LISTEN TO ME!
I JUST GOT WORD

36:40.160 --> 36:41.718
FROM SHAWN
THAT HE SOLVED THE CASE.

36:41.760 --> 36:43.125
CYRUS IS INNOCENT.

36:43.160 --> 36:45.060
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT SPENCER SAYS!

36:45.100 --> 36:46.419
- LOOK, I KNOW YOU DON'T
TRUST HIM, OKAY, BUT I DO,

36:46.470 --> 36:49.234
AND RIGHT NOW,
I NEED YOU TO TRUST ME.

36:49.270 --> 36:52.637
BOTH OF YOU!

36:52.670 --> 36:54.331
- [whimpering]

37:13.060 --> 37:14.254
- STAND DOWN, OFFICERS.

37:14.300 --> 37:15.699
LOWER YOUR WEAPONS.

37:15.730 --> 37:18.096
- [sighs]

37:18.130 --> 37:19.893
- [exhales]

37:22.040 --> 37:25.635
- [grunts]

37:25.670 --> 37:27.137
I'M FROM A NEUTRAL COUNTRY,
OKAY?

37:27.170 --> 37:28.535
- OH, GET AWAY.

37:28.580 --> 37:30.673
CRISIS AVERTED, CARLTON.

37:30.710 --> 37:32.769
CYRUS HAS SURRENDERED
AND IS IN CUSTODY.

37:32.810 --> 37:35.574
- I'M ALIVE TOO!
- COPY THAT, O'HARA.

37:35.620 --> 37:38.145
I'VE SEEN SOME DIRTY P.O.s IN
MY DAY, BUT YOU TAKE THE CAKE.

37:38.180 --> 37:40.182
- [scoffs] I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

37:40.220 --> 37:41.949
- SPENCER TOLD ME
THE WHOLE THING.

37:41.990 --> 37:44.356
YOU FOUND OUT WILSON WAS MAKING
CASH ON HIS OLD HUSTLE.

37:44.390 --> 37:45.755
TOLD HIM YOU'D LOOK
THE OTHER WAY

37:45.790 --> 37:47.678
FOR A PIECE OF THE ACTION,
RIGHT?

37:47.730 --> 37:49.152
PAID OFF MAURICE TO RELAX
THE HOUSE RULES?

37:49.200 --> 37:50.827
- I'M NOT SAYING ANYTHING.

37:50.860 --> 37:53.021
- BUT THEN WILSON SAID
HE WANTS TO GO CLEAN.

37:53.070 --> 37:55.959
AND BY THAT TIME YOU WERE IN TOO
DEEP, SO YOU HAD TO KILL HIM.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.332
- CYRUS KILLED WILSON
AND MAURICE!

37:58.370 --> 37:59.962
- THAT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE.

38:00.010 --> 38:02.604
PUT YOUR HANDS
BEHIND YOUR BACK.

38:02.640 --> 38:05.404
DO IT!

38:09.350 --> 38:12.319
YOU FOUND OUT WILSON
WAS SLEEPING WITH HIS WIFE.

38:12.350 --> 38:13.578
[handcuffs click]
WHO BETTER TO SET UP FOR MURDER

38:13.620 --> 38:15.815
THAN A SAD SACK LIKE THAT?

38:15.860 --> 38:19.887
YOU'RE A DISGRACE
TO YOUR BADGE.

38:19.930 --> 38:21.659
- WHOA, WHOA, LASSIE, HOLD UP!
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

38:21.700 --> 38:22.724
- WHOA, WHOA, BE CAREFUL!
- WHAT?

38:22.760 --> 38:23.920
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- AAH!

38:23.960 --> 38:25.291
[overlapping shouting]

38:25.330 --> 38:27.594
- YAH! HIYAH!

38:27.630 --> 38:28.665
WE GOT HIM!
WE GOT HIM.

38:28.700 --> 38:34.309
[slow clapping]

38:36.110 --> 38:38.032
- WHAT TH E--

38:44.320 --> 38:46.743
HOW DO YOU ALWAYS MANAGE
TO DO THIS?

38:48.920 --> 38:50.285
- COME ON, GET UP!

38:50.320 --> 38:52.459
COME ON, GET UP. TAKE HIM AWAY.
- GET UP.

39:02.240 --> 39:03.332
- HEY, GUYS.

39:03.370 --> 39:05.235
- HEY, BIG WOOD!
- HI, ON MY WAY

39:05.270 --> 39:07.135
TO VISIT CYRUS IN PRISON.

39:07.170 --> 39:09.730
GOT HIM A "CONGRATULATIONS
ON YOUR REDUCED SENTENCE" CAKE.

39:09.780 --> 39:11.077
MM, COST ABOUT A BUCK
AND A HALF MORE,

39:11.110 --> 39:13.146
BUT I THINK HE'LL APPRECIATE IT,
HUH?

39:13.180 --> 39:15.171
WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO BRING ALONG
ANY SPECIAL MESSAGES

39:15.220 --> 39:17.438
FROM THE GROUP?
- UH, NO, NO.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.038
BECAUSE THE GROUP
DOES NOT HAVE A SICK,

39:19.090 --> 39:21.342
CRACK-MINDED ATTACHMENT TO HIM.
JUST YOU DO.

39:21.390 --> 39:23.585
- WELL, YOU DON'T GET OVER
AN EXPERIENCE LIKE THAT.

39:23.620 --> 39:24.689
- SURE.
- MM.

39:24.730 --> 39:26.027
- JULIET...
- MM?

39:26.060 --> 39:27.084
- YOU SHOULD BE PROUD
OF YOUR WORK

39:27.130 --> 39:28.995
IN THE AUTOPSY ROOM.
- MM.

39:29.030 --> 39:30.452
- I WILL NEVER AGAIN BE ABLE
TO LOOK AT A BOGGY PROSTATE

39:30.500 --> 39:34.095
WITHOUT THINKING OF YOU.
- YOU'RE SWEET, WOODY.

39:34.130 --> 39:35.438
DO YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU SHOULD TELL

39:35.470 --> 39:36.994
YOUR REAL DAUGHTER
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED?

39:37.040 --> 39:38.359
- ALREADY DID.

39:38.410 --> 39:39.900
SHE IS NOW
MY 44TH TWITTER FOLLOWER.

39:39.940 --> 39:41.669
- OH.
- HOW SWEET.

39:41.710 --> 39:43.769
- YEAH, THEN MY ACCOUNT GOT
HACKED AND SENT OUT SPAM EMAIL

39:43.810 --> 39:46.176
FROM DEVIANT DATING SITES.
- HMM.

39:46.210 --> 39:48.474
- OR I HIT "RETWEET"
BY MISTAKE.

39:48.520 --> 39:50.715
EITHER WAY,
SHE'S GLAD I'M NOT DEAD.

39:50.750 --> 39:52.240
- THERE IT IS.

39:52.290 --> 39:54.656
- OKAY, LET'S GO GET OUR GLORY.
- YEAH.

39:56.260 --> 39:57.750
- WOOD, I SURE HOPE
YOU'RE NOT HIDING

39:57.790 --> 39:59.189
A GUN IN THERE FOR OLD CYRUS.
[laughter]

39:59.230 --> 40:01.050
- OH, YOU GUYS!

40:01.090 --> 40:03.991
I'M NOT THAT ATTACHED.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.861
- SORRY, SORRY!

40:08.900 --> 40:11.391
TOUGH BEING NEEDED BY EVERYONE
ALL THE TIME.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.998
- ALL RIGHT, CHIEF.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.507
WE'RE ALL PRESENT
AND ACCOUNTED FOR.

40:14.540 --> 40:18.078
- YOU KNOW, WHEN I FIRST JOINED
THIS DEPARTMENT...

40:19.750 --> 40:21.377
I HAD A BIT
OF A CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE

40:21.410 --> 40:22.718
TOWARDS YOU ALL,
AND TO BE FAIR,

40:22.750 --> 40:24.479
IT WAS JUST MY OWN PREJUDICE.

40:24.520 --> 40:27.546
IT WAS NOTHING THAT YOU GUYS
HAD DONE OR NOT DONE,

40:27.590 --> 40:29.080
'CAUSE FRANKLY,
I HADN'T SEEN YOU IN ACTION.

40:29.120 --> 40:31.259
AND I HAVE TO SAY,
YOUR TEAMWORK,

40:31.290 --> 40:35.090
YOUR UNWAVERING SUPPORT,
YOUR CAMARADERIE,

40:35.130 --> 40:37.758
THREE THINGS I HATE.
THE FACT REMAINS,

40:37.800 --> 40:42.294
YOU GUYS ARE THE MOST MISGUIDED,
INSUBORDINATE GROUP OF PEOPLE

40:42.340 --> 40:44.865
THAT I HAVE EVER SUPERVISED
IN MY CAREER,

40:44.910 --> 40:47.504
AND I REFUSE
TO RUN A DEPARTMENT

40:47.540 --> 40:50.202
WHERE I DON'T HAVE 100% SUPPORT

40:50.240 --> 40:52.299
FROM EVERY OFFICER
UNDER MY COMMAND!

40:52.350 --> 40:55.444
NOW, I'M VERY COMFORTABLE SAYING
THE FOLLOWING...

40:55.480 --> 40:58.278
YOU'RE FIRED,
YOU'RE FIRED!

40:58.320 --> 41:01.209
YOU TWO WERE NEVER HIRED,
BUT YOU'RE BOTH FIRED IN SPIRIT.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.456
YOU GUYS ARE REMNANTS
OF THE FORMER REGIME,

41:02.490 --> 41:04.219
AND CLEARING YOU OUT

41:04.260 --> 41:05.682
IS THE FIRST STEP
INTO BRINGING THIS DEPARTMENT

41:05.730 --> 41:09.120
INTO THE 215T CENTURY.
[laughs]

41:09.160 --> 41:11.299
DISMISSED!
[laughs]

41:11.330 --> 41:13.628
- NO. _
[phone ringing]

41:13.670 --> 41:15.763
- HOLD ON A SECOND.

41:17.770 --> 41:20.864
YEAH, TROUT HERE.
YEAH.

41:20.910 --> 41:23.401
YEAH, I GOT A MINUTE.
YEAH.

41:23.440 --> 41:25.908
YEs, SIR.
YEs, SIR.

41:25.950 --> 41:27.872
SURE.

41:31.480 --> 41:33.311
YEAH, I JUST GOT FIRED.

41:33.350 --> 41:35.386
INTERNAL AFFAIRS DETERMINED
THAT MY TACTICS

41:35.420 --> 41:37.217
DURING THE HOSTAGE STANDOFF
EXPOSED THE DEPARTMENT

41:37.260 --> 41:39.979
TO UNNECESSARY LIABILITIES
DUE TO THE HIGH RISK OF CIVILIAN

41:40.030 --> 41:42.396
AND OFFICER CASUALTIES
DURING THE OPERATION.

41:42.430 --> 41:44.227
OKAY, WELL...

41:44.260 --> 41:47.423
THIS IS ME PACKING IT IN.
OKAY?

41:47.470 --> 41:50.530
THINK I LEFT
A GUN OVER HERE.

41:50.570 --> 41:53.437
YOU KNOW, AS A CONSULTANT,

41:53.470 --> 41:55.438
I'M ALWAYS PREPARED,
YOU KNOW?

41:55.480 --> 41:58.074
'CAUSE AT A CERTAIN POINT, AN
ASSIGNMENT WILL COME TO AN END.

42:00.480 --> 42:03.176
OH, AND BY THE WAY,
I NEVER GOT YOU TWO AS A COUPLE.

42:04.590 --> 42:07.548
JUST SAYING.

42:07.590 --> 42:10.479
- WHA--NO!

42:10.520 --> 42:13.978
- OH! WELL, THAT'S NOT--
HE CAN'T--HE'S BITTER.

42:14.030 --> 42:15.190
HE CAN'T SAY THAT,
SWEETH EART.
