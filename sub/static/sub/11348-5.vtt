IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM,

THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:24.258 --> 00:25.459
- OKAY.

00:25.493 --> 00:27.795
NOW THE CAMERA IS ROLLING.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.200

00:32.233 --> 00:34.235
I'M FROM EAST AURORA, NEW YORK.

00:34.268 --> 00:37.238
AND I'M ABOUT TO START COLLEGE
IN NEW YORK CITY.

00:37.271 --> 00:38.472
- WELCOME, EVIE.

00:38.506 --> 00:41.275
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

00:41.309 --> 00:42.676
- ABOUT COLLEGE?

00:42.710 --> 00:44.178
UM, I GUESS.

00:44.212 --> 00:46.180
I'VE NEVER BEEN
AWAY FROM HOME BEFORE,

00:46.214 --> 00:48.249
AND I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY
TO PAY FOR SCHOOL.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.351
- WELL, THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE.

00:50.384 --> 00:51.519
AND YOU HAVE A LOT
GOING FOR YOU,

00:51.552 --> 00:53.187
SUCH A TIGHT BODY.

00:53.221 --> 00:55.589
- [laughs]
- YOU LIKE SHOWING IT OFF?

00:55.623 --> 00:58.726
- UH...YES, I LOVE IT.

00:58.759 --> 01:01.095
- EXCELLENT.
HOW OLD ARE YOU EVIE?

01:01.129 --> 01:03.231
DO YOU HAVE
YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE?

01:03.264 --> 01:05.366
- I'M 18...TODAY.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.135
IT'S MY BIRTHDAY.

01:07.168 --> 01:09.570

01:09.603 --> 01:12.173
READY TO CELEBRATE WITH A BANG?

01:12.206 --> 01:14.242

01:14.275 --> 01:17.245

01:17.278 --> 01:18.812
- UH...NO.

01:18.846 --> 01:21.382
I'VE HAD BOYFRIENDS BEFORE.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.784
I'VE JUST NEVER BEEN ON CAMERA.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.486
- WELL, MAYBE I CAN
MAKE IT EASIER.

01:25.519 --> 01:28.189
INSTEAD OF POSING NUDE
FOR 300 BUCKS,

01:28.222 --> 01:30.524
I CAN MULTIPLY THAT BY 10.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.160
- $3,000?

01:32.193 --> 01:34.462
- YOU SAID YOU NEEDED
MONEY FOR SCHOOL.

01:34.495 --> 01:35.563
YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY FACE.

01:35.596 --> 01:36.564
LET ME SEE YOUR EYES.

THE REST OF YOU.

01:49.677 --> 01:51.345
VERY NICE.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.780
NOW YOUR PANTS.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.284
- [laughs nervously]

01:56.317 --> 01:59.453
- YOU EVER BEEN WITH TWO GUYS
AT THE SAME TIME?

01:59.487 --> 02:00.554
- NO.

02:00.588 --> 02:02.456
- OH, I THINK YOU'RE
GONNA LIKE IT.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.225

02:15.469 --> 02:17.271
DUDE, BREAKING NEWS:
THEY'RE ALL STAGED.

02:17.305 --> 02:19.340
THERE'S NO WAY
THOSE SLUTS ARE 18.

02:19.373 --> 02:21.675
- OH, THIS ONE IS.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.211
RECOGNIZE HER?

02:23.244 --> 02:24.512
IT'S EVIE.

02:24.545 --> 02:25.479
- EVIE?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.181
THE MOUSY GIRL FROM ECON?

02:27.215 --> 02:29.483

02:34.622 --> 02:36.524
HOW DID I MISS THAT ASS?

02:36.557 --> 02:39.227
- INVITE HER

02:39.260 --> 02:41.329

COOL.

02:57.010 --> 02:58.212
VODKA SHOT?

02:58.246 --> 02:59.313
- NO, I'M GOOD.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.282
- SHE'S A CLASSY GIRL.

03:01.315 --> 03:02.883
DON'T SERVE HER THAT SWILL.

03:02.916 --> 03:06.354
EVIE, I'VE GOT A PREMIUM BREW
IN OUR BATHROOM.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.322

03:22.970 --> 03:24.472
- TAKE YOUR PICK.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.274
- THANKS.

03:27.841 --> 03:29.243
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

03:29.277 --> 03:31.679
- WHAT'S THE MATTER?

03:31.712 --> 03:34.615
OH, ARE YOU SHY,
BIRTHDAY GIRL?

03:34.648 --> 03:35.816
YOU'RE 18...

03:35.849 --> 03:37.685
both: WITH A BANG!

03:37.718 --> 03:39.720
- PLEASE--LET ME OUT!

03:39.753 --> 03:41.355
LET ME OUT!

[dramatic music]

04:30.070 --> 04:30.471
.

04:30.504 --> 04:31.271
- DETECTIVES,
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

04:32.373 --> 04:33.407
JUSTIN ADAMS, EVIE'S R.A.

04:33.441 --> 04:34.408
SHE'S A FRESHMAN.

04:34.442 --> 04:35.776
- OKAY, AND SHE WAS ASSAULTED?

04:35.809 --> 04:36.910
- YEAH.

04:36.944 --> 04:38.579
I GOT UP EARLY TO TAKE A RUN.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.981
EVIE WAS CURLED UP
ON A LOUNGE COUCH,

04:41.014 --> 04:42.916
ALL MESSED UP.

04:42.950 --> 04:45.719
SHE SAID SHE'D BEEN TO A PARTY
WHERE TWO BOYS RAPED HER.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.455
- CAMPUS SECURITY
TOLD YOU TO CALL US?

04:47.488 --> 04:49.056
- NO, I'VE BEEN HERE FOUR YEARS.

04:49.089 --> 04:51.058
I KNOW NOT TO GET
THOSE GUYS INVOLVED.

04:51.091 --> 04:53.627
I WROTE DOWN THE NAMES
OF HER ATTACKERS.

04:53.661 --> 04:55.496
I WASN'T SURPRISED
TO HEAR IT WAS THEM.

04:55.529 --> 04:56.597
- WHY IS THAT?

04:56.630 --> 04:59.066
- THE GUYS ON THE FIFTH FLOOR
ARE ENTITLED D-BAGS.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.068
EVIE'S A SWEET GIRL,
KIND OF SHY.

05:01.101 --> 05:04.538
EVIE, IT'S JUSTIN.
I CALLED THE POLICE.

05:04.572 --> 05:06.440
- WHY'D YOU DO THAT?

05:06.474 --> 05:07.641
- OKAY, EVIE...

05:07.675 --> 05:08.509
HI, IT'S DETECTIVE ROLLINS.

05:08.542 --> 05:10.077
CAN WE JUST TALK TO YOU
FOR A MINUTE?

05:10.110 --> 05:11.779
- IT'S OKAY;
THEY'RE HERE TO HELP.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.050
- I DIDN'T ASK HIM
TO CALL THE POLICE.

05:17.084 --> 05:18.886
- YOUR R.A. WAS
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

05:18.919 --> 05:20.053
HE DID THE RIGHT THING.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.522
- WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO PRESS CHARGES.

05:21.555 --> 05:23.691
- THAT'S YOUR CHOICE.

05:23.724 --> 05:25.826
YOUR ASSAILANTS,
THEY LIVE IN YOUR DORM, RIGHT?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.395
THE SCHOOL YEAR JUST STARTED.

05:27.428 --> 05:32.433
YOU'RE GONNA BE
SEEING THEM EVERYWHERE.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.935
- I'LL CALL CARISI,
TAKE SOME STATEMENTS.

05:37.405 --> 05:38.872
- I SHOULDN'T HAVE
TOLD JUSTIN THEIR NAMES,

05:38.906 --> 05:41.675
BUT HE WAS JUST
BEING SO NICE.

05:43.176 --> 05:44.478
- UM...

05:46.179 --> 05:47.648
CAN YOU--

05:47.681 --> 05:49.550
CAN YOU JUST TELL ME
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:49.583 --> 05:51.485
YOU WENT TO A PARTY, RIGHT?

05:51.519 --> 05:54.555
- I WISH I'D STAYED
IN MY ROOM AND STUDIED.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.123
BUT HE KNOCKED ON MY DOOR.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.425
- AND WHO'S THIS?

05:58.926 --> 06:00.761
- DANIEL PRYOR.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.963
HE'S ONE OF THE COOL GUYS.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.898
HE BARELY LOOKED AT ME
BEFORE LAST NIGHT.

06:04.932 --> 06:06.500
AND THEN, OUT OF NOWHERE,

06:06.534 --> 06:11.539
HE CAME DOWNSTAIRS
AND INVITED ME TO A PARTY.

06:11.572 --> 06:13.140
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN WHY.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.509
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

06:18.846 --> 06:22.115
- THIS SPRING,
BEFORE I STARTED COLLEGE,

06:22.149 --> 06:25.586
I NEEDED MONEY,
FIRST SEMESTER'S TUITION.

06:25.619 --> 06:26.854
AND MY DAD WAS SICK,

06:26.887 --> 06:29.623
SO I ANSWERED AN AD
FOR MODELING WORK.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.426
BUT...

06:32.460 --> 06:33.561
IT WASN'T MODELING.

06:33.594 --> 06:35.629
- WHATEVER YOU'VE DONE BEFORE,

06:35.663 --> 06:38.198
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOU BEING ASSAULTED.

06:38.231 --> 06:40.801
- I THINK IT DOES.

06:40.834 --> 06:42.770
THEY SAW ME.

06:42.803 --> 06:45.573
THE MODELING WORK, IT--

06:45.606 --> 06:46.474
IT WAS A VIDEO.

06:46.507 --> 06:47.741
IT WAS--

06:49.677 --> 06:50.811
IT WAS PORN.

06:53.514 --> 06:56.617
PLEASE, DON'T TELL MY PARENTS.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.618
- IT'S OKAY.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.520
EVIE.

06:59.553 --> 07:01.555
YOU KNOW WHAT, WE'RE GONNA
TAKE THIS ONE STEP AT A TIME.

07:01.589 --> 07:02.923
THEY HURT YOU, RIGHT?

07:02.956 --> 07:05.125
DID YOU TAKE A SHOWER?

07:05.158 --> 07:06.727
- NO, THE BATHROOM'S CO-ED.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.563
- THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD THING.

07:09.597 --> 07:11.599
WE'RE GONNA GET YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL, OKAY?

07:17.004 --> 07:18.506
- EVIE IS SAYING SHE WAS RAPED?

07:18.539 --> 07:20.107
- BY YOU AND MATT.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.675
IT WASN'T LIKE THAT?

07:21.709 --> 07:22.676
- NO.

07:22.710 --> 07:23.711
WE HAD SEX.

07:23.744 --> 07:24.912
SHE JUST DID US BOTH.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.079
- OKAY.

07:26.113 --> 07:27.581
SHE'S A LITTLE ROUGHED UP,
THOUGH.

07:27.615 --> 07:28.982
- WELL, YEAH.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.185
WE RAG-DOLLED HER,

07:32.219 --> 07:34.087
BUT COMPARED TO WHAT SHE'S DONE,
IT WAS NOTHING.

07:34.121 --> 07:35.723
- WHAT SHE'S DONE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

07:35.756 --> 07:38.025
- NOT TO MAKE HER OUT
TO BE A SLUT OR ANYTHING,

07:38.058 --> 07:40.861
BUT YOU GUYS KNOW
SHE DID A PORN VIDEO, RIGHT?

07:40.894 --> 07:42.696
- YEAH, WELL,
WE'LL GET TO THAT LATER,

07:42.730 --> 07:45.165
BUT LET'S TALK
ABOUT LAST NIGHT.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.601
- OKAY.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.970
WE OFFER HER A BEER.

07:50.003 --> 07:51.539
THEY'RE IN THE BATHROOM TUB.

07:51.572 --> 07:54.675
SHE FOLLOWS US IN,
SHUTS THE DOOR,

07:54.708 --> 07:56.176
AND JUST GOES WILD.

07:56.209 --> 07:57.978
WANTS US BOTH.

07:58.011 --> 07:58.979
TAG-TEAM.

07:59.012 --> 08:01.915
SHE'S MOANING, SCREAMING...

08:01.949 --> 08:03.617
- LIKE SHE DID
IN THE VIDEO, RIGHT?

08:03.651 --> 08:04.752
- YEAH.

08:04.785 --> 08:06.720
YEAH, THAT'S WHY I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE CALLED THE POLICE.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.022
- YOU KNOW HOW IT IS
WITH THESE GIRLS.

08:09.056 --> 08:11.725
MORNING-AFTER REGRET.

08:11.759 --> 08:14.027
ANYTHING YOU DID
THAT SHE MISINTERPRETED?

08:14.061 --> 08:15.563
- NO WAY.

08:15.596 --> 08:17.565
ALL THE STUFF WE DID,
SHE LIKES.

08:17.598 --> 08:18.732
THAT 18 WITH A BANG VIDEO

08:18.766 --> 08:21.702
WAS WAY MORE HARDCORE
THAN WE WERE.

08:21.735 --> 08:22.736
- [sighs]

08:22.770 --> 08:24.738
18 WITH A BANG.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.073
- YEAH, IT'S A SERIES.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.240
THEY CLAIM TO GET GIRLS

08:27.274 --> 08:29.643
WHO DREAM OF MAKING A PORNO
THE DAY THEY BECOME LEGAL.

08:29.677 --> 08:31.745
- MOST OF THESE GIRLS
HAVEN'T BEEN 18 IN A WHILE.

08:31.779 --> 08:34.314
- BUT OURS ACTUALLY WAS.

08:34.347 --> 08:35.148
EVIE.

08:35.182 --> 08:36.784
SHE EVEN USED
HER REAL FIRST NAME.

08:36.817 --> 08:37.918
- FILM CLASS IS OVER.

08:37.951 --> 08:41.088
WHATEVER EVIE DID HAS NO BEARING
ON WHAT HAPPENED TO HER.

08:41.121 --> 08:42.322
- WELL, THESE GUYS
SAY IT DOES.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.124
BECAUSE SHE WANTED IT
IN THE PORN MOVIE,

08:44.157 --> 08:46.927
SHE WANTED THEM.

08:46.960 --> 08:47.928
HELLO?

08:47.961 --> 08:49.830
A THIRD OF THE TRAFFIC
ON THE INTERNET IS PORN.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.965
THAT'S HOW MOST OF THESE
COLLEGE GUYS LEARN ABOUT SEX.

08:51.999 --> 08:54.034
- CARISI, STOP.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

08:54.067 --> 08:55.603
- EVIE SAID NO.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.804
SHE WASN'T DRUNK.

08:56.837 --> 08:59.272
SHE GAVE A DETAILED ACCOUNT
OF THE ASSAULT,

08:59.306 --> 09:01.308
AND THE EXAM IN THE E.R.
WAS CONSISTENT

09:01.341 --> 09:02.743
WITH FORCIBLE PENETRATION.

09:02.776 --> 09:04.712
THE RAPE KIT SHOWED
THE PRESENCE OF SEMEN.

09:04.745 --> 09:07.314
- SO SHE MADE ONE
FIRST-TIMER PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEO.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.315
- YEAH, IN NEW HAMPSHIRE.

09:08.348 --> 09:10.584
- ONE OF THE FEW PLACES
YOU CAN STILL MAKE PORN

09:10.618 --> 09:11.852
WITHOUT A CONDOM.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.020
- LIVE FREE OR DIE.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.655
WHAT ELSE DO WE KNOW
ABOUT EVIE?

09:14.688 --> 09:17.625
- HER R.A. SAYS SHE'S
A SHY, NICE GIRL.

09:17.658 --> 09:19.359
- SHE HAS NO HISTORY
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.228
SHE'S MADE NO
PRIOR ALLEGATIONS.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.763
- IT'S STILL
THEY-SAID, SHE-SAID.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.632
- BUT MAYBE NOT,
BECAUSE AT THE HOSPITAL,

09:24.665 --> 09:26.366
EVIE TOLD ME,
AFTER A MINUTE,

09:26.399 --> 09:29.036
THAT DANIEL TURNED ON
HIS CELL PHONE CAM.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.104
SO SHE THINKS THAT THE WHOLE
THING MIGHT HAVE BEEN RECORDED.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.305
- ROLLINS, YOU'RE JUST
TELLING ME THIS NOW?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.642
- I DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO SPEAK
WITH YOU TODAY, SERGEANT.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.109
- I'LL GET YOU A WARRANT
FOR HIS PHONE.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.945
SEE IF THE VIDEO
CONFIRMS HER STORY.

09:37.978 --> 09:40.681
- OKAY, FIN, CARISI,
GO BACK TO THESE TWO.

09:40.714 --> 09:42.716
GET ME THAT VIDEO,
IF IT EXISTS.

09:42.750 --> 09:46.119
ROLLINS, FIND OUT EVERYTHING
ABOUT EVIE'S BACKGROUND, OKAY?

09:46.153 --> 09:47.587
NO SURPRISES.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.360
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

09:53.393 --> 09:54.394
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK.

09:54.427 --> 09:55.328
I'D LIKE THIS CASE A LOT MORE

09:55.362 --> 09:56.797
IF SHE HADN'T MADE
A PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEO.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.632
[knocking]
- WE GOT COMPANY.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.635
- AH, COUNSELOR BUCHANAN.

10:01.669 --> 10:03.103
- TO WHAT DO WE OWE
THE PLEASURE?

10:03.136 --> 10:04.638
- IT'S YOUR LUCKY DAY.

10:04.672 --> 10:07.240
I'LL BE REPRESENTING
DANIEL PRYOR AND MATTHEW COOPER

10:07.274 --> 10:09.242
FOR THE DURATION
OF THIS FARCE.

10:09.276 --> 10:10.678
- THAT WAS FAST.

10:10.711 --> 10:12.045
- SO WAS YOUR RUSH TO JUDGMENT.

10:12.079 --> 10:14.247
THESE ARE TWO BRIGHT,
HARD-WORKING BOYS

10:14.281 --> 10:16.149
WITH THEIR WHOLE LIVES
AHEAD OF THEM.

10:16.183 --> 10:17.651
- SAVE IT FOR THE JURY.

10:17.685 --> 10:20.187
- I DON'T THINK WE'LL
BE TAKING THIS TO TRIAL.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.222
THESE GRAY CASES,
THEY GET SO MUCH EASIER

10:22.255 --> 10:24.224
WHEN YOU CAN GO TO TAPE.

10:24.257 --> 10:25.826
THE VIDEO THE BOYS MADE.

10:25.859 --> 10:30.030
IT'S...IN BAD TASTE,
BUT NOT CRIMINAL.

10:30.063 --> 10:31.865
DON'T WORRY;
IT'S UNCUT AND UNCENSORED.

10:31.899 --> 10:33.834
- OH, WE'LL BE
DOUBLE-CHECKING THAT.

10:33.867 --> 10:35.769
- AND YOU MIGHT WANT
TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS ONE,

10:35.803 --> 10:37.270
THE PROFESSIONAL VERSION.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.706
- WE'VE SEEN IT.

10:38.739 --> 10:39.740
- IT?

10:39.773 --> 10:41.709
OR THEM?

10:41.742 --> 10:43.310
SHE'S QUITE PROLIFIC,

10:43.343 --> 10:46.413
AND NOT NEARLY AS INNOCENT
AS SHE LOOKS.

10:46.446 --> 10:48.315
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT SELLS.

10:48.348 --> 10:49.883
[chuckles]

11:06.900 --> 11:07.100
.

11:07.134 --> 11:07.768
- SMILE FOR THE CAMERA.
- NO!

11:08.201 --> 11:09.002
- SMILE.
- STOP!

11:09.036 --> 11:11.371
- WE KNOW YOU LIKE IT ROUGH.
- NO--

11:11.404 --> 11:13.373
- THE VIDEO FROM DANIEL'S PHONE

11:13.406 --> 11:15.809
CORROBORATES EVERYTHING
EVIE TOLD US.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.745
THEY CORNERED HER
IN A BATHROOM.

11:17.778 --> 11:19.279
SHE ASKED THEM TO STOP,
AND THEY WOULDN'T LISTEN.

11:19.312 --> 11:20.213
- THOSE BOYS ARE ROUGH.

11:20.247 --> 11:24.251
- SO IS THIS,
FROM OUR SOPHOMORE OUTING.

11:24.284 --> 11:25.886
- PLEASE, STOP.

11:25.919 --> 11:27.955
I DON'T WANT TO.

11:27.988 --> 11:28.956
NO.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.023
- WE GET THE IDEA.

11:30.057 --> 11:32.192
- YEAH, YOU'VE PRETTY MUCH
SEEN IT ALREADY ANYWAY.

11:32.225 --> 11:33.060
MATT AND DANIEL'S VIDEO

11:33.093 --> 11:35.028
IS OF A PIECE
WITH A LOT OF HER WORK.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.396
- HOW MANY?

11:36.429 --> 11:38.165
- LIKE, A BAKER'S DOZEN
ON BUCHANAN'S FLASH DRIVE.

11:38.198 --> 11:42.803
AND AFTER THE FIRST ONE,
18 WITH A BANG,

11:42.836 --> 11:45.105
SHE USES A PSEUDONYM,

11:45.138 --> 11:47.174
ROXXXANNE--THREE Xs--DEMAY.

11:47.207 --> 11:50.443
- MOST ARE VIOLENT, TAG-TEAM
RAPE FANTASY SCENARIOS.

11:50.477 --> 11:52.212
- YEAH, AND UNLESS WE BELIEVE

11:52.245 --> 11:54.147
THAT SHE FORGOT
ABOUT THE OTHER 12 FILMS,

11:54.181 --> 11:56.116
SHE LIED TO US.
- SO SHE LIED TO US.

11:56.149 --> 11:59.086
SO INSTEAD OF FOCUSING
ON WHAT EVIE DIDN'T TELL US,

11:59.119 --> 12:02.122
I'D LIKE TO FOCUS
ON HOW WE MISSED THIS.

12:02.155 --> 12:03.356
- WELL, I JUST STARTED
TO VET HER.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.892
- WELL, THE DEFENSE
FOUND IT FAST.

12:04.925 --> 12:06.426
- SHE USED A DIFFERENT NAME
ON THE OTHER VIDEOS.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.161
PLUS, THEY'RE BEHIND PAYWALL.

12:08.195 --> 12:09.897
- YEAH, MAYBE BUCHANAN
WAS A SUBSCRIBER.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.164
- IT'S ALL MOOT.

12:11.198 --> 12:12.966
I MEAN, IF A JUDGE
ALLOWS THESE IN,

12:13.000 --> 12:15.268
HOW'S BARBA EVER GONNA EXPLAIN
THE DIFFERENCE TO A JURY?

12:15.302 --> 12:19.172
- BECAUSE ON THE BOYS' VIDEO,
SHE DIDN'T GIVE CONSENT.

12:19.206 --> 12:20.307
SHE WASN'T PAID,

12:20.340 --> 12:22.876
AND SHE SAID NO.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.344
- COME ON, LIV,
YOU KNOW SEX WORKERS

12:24.377 --> 12:25.946
DON'T GET THE BENEFIT
OF THE DOUBT.

12:25.979 --> 12:27.214
- THAT'S NOT
HOW WE GO INTO THIS.

12:27.247 --> 12:29.216
AND I DON'T WANT
TO BE BLINDSIDED AGAIN.

12:29.249 --> 12:30.317
IS THAT CLEAR?

12:30.350 --> 12:32.452
[applause]

12:32.485 --> 12:34.187
- GREAT SPEECH.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.890
BETTER HEADLINE.

12:39.559 --> 12:42.129
SERGEANT BENSON, YOUR OFFICE.

12:43.496 --> 12:47.200
WHICH ONE OF THESE DETECTIVES
IS YOUR NUMBER TWO?

12:47.234 --> 12:48.301
- FIN.

12:55.442 --> 12:58.078
- HOW ARE YOUR FAMILY PROBLEMS?

12:58.111 --> 12:58.979
- MY SON IS FINE.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.914
HE'S HOME FROM THE HOSPITAL;
THANK YOU.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.215
- GOOD.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.051
NOW, YOU'RE STILL A NEW
ACTING COMMANDING OFFICER,

13:04.084 --> 13:05.518
SO PERHAPS YOU DIDN'T APPRECIATE

13:05.552 --> 13:08.188
THAT 1PP AND COMPSTAT
FOLLOW EVERYTHING

13:08.221 --> 13:09.222
THAT YOU AND YOUR DETECTIVES DO.

13:09.256 --> 13:10.223
- WE ARE AWARE.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.059
- IT'S NOT ON THE SERGEANT.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.526
THE GIRL MISINFORMED US.

13:13.560 --> 13:15.062
THIS HAPPENS A LOT WITH VICS.

13:15.095 --> 13:16.463
WE WERE JUST STARTING
TO VET HER.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.999
- I'M USED TO SLOPPY
POLICE WORK, DETECTIVE TUTUOLA.

13:19.032 --> 13:20.433
- NO, IT'S ON ME.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.468
WE JUST CAUGHT THE CASE.

13:21.501 --> 13:23.236
- IF IT IS A CASE.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.173
WHAT YOU MAY HAVE HERE
IS A DISTURBED FEMALE STUDENT

13:26.206 --> 13:28.308
WHO WILLINGLY PORTRAYS
VIOLENT SEX ACTS ON FILM.

13:28.341 --> 13:30.343
- WELL, IT SHOULDN'T MATTER.

13:30.377 --> 13:31.478
SHE SAID SHE WAS RAPED.

13:31.511 --> 13:33.046
WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE THAT.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.081
- DON'T PREACH, SERGEANT,

13:34.114 --> 13:35.315
NOT WITH EGG ON YOUR FACE.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.217
MY OTHER CONCERN IS PROTOCOL.

13:37.250 --> 13:39.119
WHY WAS HUDSON KEPT
OUT OF THE LOOP?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.521
PRESIDENT ROBERTS HAD TO HEAR
ABOUT THIS FROM A REPORTER.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.856
- DID SHE?

13:42.890 --> 13:44.524
IT'S NOT OUR JOB
TO NOTIFY HUDSON.

13:44.557 --> 13:47.527
- AND FOR THE RECORD, CHIEF,

13:47.560 --> 13:50.163
THE STUDENT'S R.A. CALLED US,

13:50.197 --> 13:52.866
BECAUSE EVERYBODY KNOWS
THAT CAMPUS SECURITY

13:52.900 --> 13:55.869
PRESSURES GIRLS
INTO DROPPING CHARGES.

13:55.903 --> 13:58.171
IT SEEMS THAT HUDSON UNIVERSITY
IS MORE CONCERNED

13:58.205 --> 14:01.574
WITH THEIR CLERY ACT STATS
THAN THEY ARE WITH RAPE.

14:01.608 --> 14:04.344
- AH, SO IT'S TRUE.

14:04.377 --> 14:06.880
THE WORD UPSTAIRS IS
YOU HAVE AN AGENDA.

14:06.914 --> 14:08.281
IT COLORS YOUR PERCEPTION.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.249
- EXCUSE ME?

14:09.282 --> 14:11.284
- THIS IS NOT THE CASE
TO EMBARRASS HUDSON

14:11.318 --> 14:14.321
OR THE DEPARTMENT WITH.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.589
PICK YOUR BATTLES.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.333
- I DIDN'T KNOW ANYONE WOULD SEE
THOSE OTHER VIDEOS.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.568
MY PRODUCER SAID
THEY WERE BEHIND A PAYWALL.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.038
- THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS.
- SO YOU'RE DROPPING THE CASE?

14:31.071 --> 14:32.405
- NO, WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE
TO INVESTIGATE.

14:32.439 --> 14:33.673
BUT MOVING FORWARD,

14:33.706 --> 14:36.143
YOU GOT TO TELL US EVERYTHING,

14:36.176 --> 14:38.145
YOUR PROFESSIONAL HISTORY,
YOUR BOYFRIENDS,

14:38.178 --> 14:39.546
THE KINDS OF SEX YOU'VE HAD,

14:39.579 --> 14:42.282
ANYTHING THAT YOU'VE
GOTTEN PAID FOR.

14:42.315 --> 14:44.151
- I'M NOT A SLUT.

14:44.184 --> 14:46.119
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT, BUT...

14:46.153 --> 14:48.989
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THEIR
DEFENSE ATTORNEY WILL, SO...

14:49.022 --> 14:51.358
- THEY RAPED ME.

14:51.391 --> 14:52.659
I DIDN'T WANT IT,

14:52.692 --> 14:54.494
AND I DID NOT AGREE
TO BE FILMED.

14:54.527 --> 14:56.096
THEY THINK JUST
BECAUSE I DO PORN,

14:56.129 --> 14:57.630
THEY CAN DO
WHATEVER THEY WANT TO ME.

14:57.664 --> 14:59.399
- THEY CAN'T.

14:59.432 --> 15:02.202
BUT IF YOU'VE LEFT ANYTHING OUT,
TELL ME NOW.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.271
- EVERYTHING I DID WAS LEGAL.

15:04.304 --> 15:05.472
I SIGNED CONTRACTS.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.374
I GOT PAID.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.609
AND IT FELT GOOD.

15:09.642 --> 15:12.145
I MEAN, THESE GUYS,
THEY LOOK RIGHT THROUGH ME.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.114
BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA

15:14.147 --> 15:18.251
WHAT I AM DOING ON SET
WITH HOT PORN ACTORS.

15:23.690 --> 15:26.059
- OVER A DOZEN HARDCORE
RAPE FANTASY VIDEOS,

15:26.093 --> 15:27.394
AND SHE THOUGHT
NOBODY WOULD FIND OUT?

15:27.427 --> 15:29.129
WHAT WAS SHE THINKING?

15:29.162 --> 15:30.130
- SHE'S 18 YEARS OLD.

15:30.163 --> 15:31.098
SHE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.233
AND IT DOESN'T HELP
THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING

15:33.266 --> 15:36.036
TO MAKE HER THE POSTER CHILD
FOR EXPLOITED SEX WORKERS.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.137
THERE'S A TWITTER CAMPAIGN.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.106
AND SHE'S BEING PULLED
IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.241
ONE MINUTE, SHE'S EMPOWERED.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.575
THE NEXT MINUTE, SHE'S ASHAMED.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.644
- SHE'S HARDLY THE ONLY GIRL
TO TURN TO SEX WORK

15:44.677 --> 15:46.980
OR PORNOGRAPHY
TO PAY TUITION.

15:47.014 --> 15:48.081
- BELLE KNOX, TASHA REIGN--

15:48.115 --> 15:49.182
- I'M NOT MAKING
A MORAL JUDGMENT,

15:49.216 --> 15:50.150
BUT THE VIDEO THE BOYS MADE

15:50.183 --> 15:52.219
MIMICS ALMOST MOVE-FOR-MOVE
HER FIRST FILM.

15:52.252 --> 15:53.987
I CAN'T SELL THIS TO A JURY.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.188
- ARE YOU BACKING OFF OF THIS

15:55.222 --> 15:56.256
BECAUSE OF THE HEAT
YOU'RE GETTING

15:56.289 --> 15:57.624
FROM THE MAYOR'S OFFICE
OVER HUDSON?

15:57.657 --> 15:58.992
- YOU KNOW ME BETTER THAN THAT.

15:59.026 --> 16:00.193
- I THOUGHT I DID.

16:00.227 --> 16:01.194
- GUYS, WE'RE ALL
ON THE SAME SIDE HERE.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.530
THE REAL QUESTION IS,
CAN YOU USE RAPE SHIELD

16:03.563 --> 16:05.632
TO KEEP HER PORN VIDEOS
OUT OF THE TRIAL?

16:05.665 --> 16:06.466
- DEPENDS ON THE JUDGE.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.135
I CAN FILE A MOTION
UNDER SECTION V,

16:08.168 --> 16:09.169
BUT IT'S A CATCH-ALL.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.137
BUCHANAN WILL FIGHT IT.

16:10.170 --> 16:12.105
- BUCHANAN IS STILL
REPRESENTING BOTH BOYS?

16:12.139 --> 16:13.340
- MM-HMM.

16:13.373 --> 16:16.676
- ROLLINS, FIND OUT IF BOTH
FAMILIES ARE SPLITTING THE BILL.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.480
- YOU DOING ALL RIGHT, MATT?

16:20.513 --> 16:22.249
- HOW MUCH LONGER
IS IT GOING TO BE?

16:22.282 --> 16:23.416
- YEAH, WELL,
WE JUST NEED YOUR LAWYER

16:23.450 --> 16:24.751
TO FINISH UP WITH DANIEL.

16:24.784 --> 16:26.319
THAT'S THE PROBLEM
WITH SHARING LAWYERS.

16:26.353 --> 16:29.522
SOMEBODY GETS STUCK.

16:29.556 --> 16:30.723
YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE THE JOHN.

16:30.757 --> 16:31.724
ONCE YOU GO IN THAT ROOM...

16:31.758 --> 16:33.226
- YEAH, OKAY.

16:33.260 --> 16:35.528
- COME ON, I'LL WALK WITH YOU.

16:35.562 --> 16:38.498
IT'S OVER HERE.
JUST DOWN THE HALLWAY.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.046
HUH, HE LOOKS COMFORTABLE.

16:53.080 --> 16:55.082
YOU GUYS WORKED OUT
YOUR DEFENSE TOGETHER, RIGHT?

16:55.115 --> 16:56.316
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:56.349 --> 16:59.719
- I MEAN, YOU'RE BOTH
PAYING FOR BUCHANAN.

16:59.752 --> 17:00.720
OH, NO, THAT'S RIGHT.

17:00.753 --> 17:01.788
YOU'RE ON SCHOLARSHIP, RIGHT?

17:01.821 --> 17:05.292
- DANIEL'S FAMILY'S PAYING.
HE AND I ARE TIGHT.

17:05.325 --> 17:06.493
- OKAY.

17:06.526 --> 17:07.560
- WHAT?

17:07.594 --> 17:09.262
- IT'S JUST THAT...

17:09.296 --> 17:11.264
MAYBE THAT'S WHY HE WANTED
TO GO IN BEFORE YOU.

17:11.298 --> 17:15.135
USUALLY, WHOEVER CUTS THE
FIRST DEAL GETS THE BEST DEAL.

17:15.168 --> 17:17.837
HEY, MAN, NO, NO,
DON'T GET NERVOUS.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.606
BUT WORD TO THE WISE,

17:19.639 --> 17:21.441
IF ANYTHING SEEMS OFF,

17:21.474 --> 17:24.577
DON'T LET HIS LAWYER
MAKE YOU TAKE THE FALL.

17:27.214 --> 17:28.515
COME ON.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.489
- HEY, MATT.

17:36.523 --> 17:38.125
- SO WHAT DID DAN SAY?

17:38.158 --> 17:40.293
- THE TRUTH.

17:40.327 --> 17:42.695
THAT GIRL WANTED TO MAKE
A PORN VIDEO WITH YOU TWO.

17:42.729 --> 17:43.763
THERE WAS NO RAPE.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.165
- I DON'T KNOW;
SHE WAS CRYING.

17:45.198 --> 17:47.167
SHE DIDN'T CRY
IN THE OTHER VIDEOS.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.370
- HEY, SORRY TO
KEEP YOU WAITING.

17:50.403 --> 17:54.474
WE JUST WENT OVER THE DETAILS
WITH DANIEL AND HIS LAWYER.

17:54.507 --> 17:56.376
WE JUST NEED TO CONFIRM
THE STORY WITH YOU.

17:56.409 --> 17:57.410
- WE'RE READY.

17:57.444 --> 17:59.212
RIGHT, MATT?

17:59.246 --> 18:02.349
- OKAY, DANIEL SAID YOU
INVITED EVIE TO THE PARTY.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.317
IS THAT RIGHT?

18:04.351 --> 18:05.318
- YES.

18:05.352 --> 18:06.586
- AND HE SAID THAT YOU

18:06.619 --> 18:09.189
TALKED TO EVIE
ABOUT MAKING THE SEX TAPE,

18:09.222 --> 18:10.190
AND SHE AGREED,

18:10.223 --> 18:12.292
BUT HE HAD NO IDEA ABOUT IT.

18:12.325 --> 18:15.128
- THAT'S ALSO RIGHT,
ISN'T IT, MATT?

18:15.162 --> 18:16.696
- HE SAID THAT?

18:16.729 --> 18:18.431
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD,
THAT CLEARS DANIEL.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.200
- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:20.233 --> 18:21.434
- HOLD ON HERE.

18:21.468 --> 18:23.203
- NO, IF HE HAD NO IDEA
ABOUT THE RAPE,

18:23.236 --> 18:24.137
THEN HE'S OFF THE HOOK.

18:24.171 --> 18:25.405
- WHAT?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.174
- THEY'RE PLAYING YOU, MATT.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.242
I NEED A MOMENT ALONE
WITH MY CLIENT.

18:32.345 --> 18:34.247
- IT--

18:34.281 --> 18:36.149
IT WASN'T MY IDEA.

18:39.619 --> 18:40.653
- WHAT--

18:40.687 --> 18:42.189
THAT'S NOT WHAT
DANIEL TOLD US.

18:42.222 --> 18:44.357
HE SAID THAT YOU SHOWED HIM
HER PORN VIDEO

18:44.391 --> 18:46.459
AND SUGGESTED INVITING HER
TO THE PARTY.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.161
- WELL, YEAH,
BUT HE WAS THE ONE WHO--

18:48.195 --> 18:49.496
- THAT'S ENOUGH.
STOP SPEAKING.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.265
- WHY? WHY?
YOU GOT DANIEL OFF.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.434
THAT'S WHY HE WENT FIRST?
- AS YOUR LAWYER,

18:54.467 --> 18:56.669
I AM TELLING YOU
TO STOP SPEAKING.

18:56.703 --> 18:59.539
- WELL, THEN, YOU'RE NOT
MY LAWYER ANYMORE.

18:59.572 --> 19:01.508
- YOU CAN FIRE ME LATER,
BUT SHUT UP NOW.

19:01.541 --> 19:03.576
- NO, YOU'RE SELLING ME OUT.

19:03.610 --> 19:05.645
DANIEL WAS THE ONE LAUGHING
LIKE IT WAS A GAME,

19:05.678 --> 19:07.614
BUT SHE WAS CRYING.

19:07.647 --> 19:08.815
SHE WOULDN'T STOP.

19:08.848 --> 19:11.384
I DIDN'T GET IT
UNTIL DANIEL TOLD ME, BUT--

19:11.418 --> 19:13.286
- DIDN'T GET WHAT,
THAT YOU RAPED THAT GIRL?

19:13.320 --> 19:14.754
- IF I'M NO LONGER
YOUR ATTORNEY,

19:14.787 --> 19:17.257
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO ASK
FOR A COURT-APPOINTED ATTORNEY.

19:17.290 --> 19:20.927
- YOU'VE BEEN DISMISSED,
COUNSELOR.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.429
- MATT...

19:22.462 --> 19:25.232
JUST TAKE A MINUTE
AND THINK ABOUT THIS.

19:25.265 --> 19:26.399
- MATT...

19:28.568 --> 19:30.937
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
TALK TO US.

19:36.809 --> 19:40.480
- THE WHOLE THING
WAS DANIEL'S IDEA.

19:40.513 --> 19:44.217
I--I'D NEVER, NEVER MET
A PORN STAR BEFORE.

19:44.251 --> 19:46.853
HE SAID THAT'S HOW THEY ACTED.

19:46.886 --> 19:50.923
I--I LIED BECAUSE
AFTER WE DID HER

19:50.957 --> 19:53.260
AND THEN SHE RAN OUT,

19:53.293 --> 19:56.496
DANIEL TOLD ME THAT
I WAS GUILTY OF RAPE,

19:56.529 --> 19:58.531
THAT IT WAS ON VIDEO,

19:58.565 --> 20:03.803
THAT WE'D BOTH GO DOWN
IF I DIDN'T LIE

20:03.836 --> 20:05.972
AND SAY EVIE WANTED IT.

20:06.005 --> 20:10.310
AT FIRST, I DIDN'T THINK
YOU COULD RAPE A GIRL LIKE THAT.

20:10.343 --> 20:11.378
I'M--

20:11.411 --> 20:15.248
I'M SORRY.

20:15.282 --> 20:16.015
I'M--

20:16.048 --> 20:19.085
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.924
- THERE WE GO.
GOOD BOY.

20:24.957 --> 20:26.593
- GET HIM TO WRITE IT DOWN NOW.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.261
I'M GONNA CALL BARBA.

20:28.295 --> 20:30.797
GET A VIDEO CREW UP HERE
TO RECORD IT.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.999
CARISI...

20:33.032 --> 20:34.467
NICE WORK.

20:38.638 --> 20:39.539
- MR. AND MRS. BARNES,

20:39.572 --> 20:42.008
WE APPRECIATE YOU
COMING DOWN TO THE CITY.

20:42.041 --> 20:45.545
- AND I KNOW THAT EVIE
APPRECIATES IT TOO.

20:45.578 --> 20:47.680
- YES, THANK YOU, MOM AND DAD.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.284
- EVIE SAID THIS
IS GOING TO TRIAL?

20:51.318 --> 20:53.653
- WE HAVE A VERY GOOD CASE.
ONE OF THE BOYS CONFESSED,

20:53.686 --> 20:55.054
AND HE'S MADE A DEAL.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.289
HE'LL TESTIFY
AGAINST THE OTHER BOY.

20:56.323 --> 20:56.956
- WHAT IS IT YOU WANT FROM US?

20:56.989 --> 20:58.558
- BOB, PLEASE.

21:01.027 --> 21:03.029
- WE WERE HOPING
YOU WOULD ATTEND THE TRIAL.

21:03.062 --> 21:04.096
JURIES ARE MORE SYMPATHETIC

21:04.130 --> 21:06.499
WHEN THEY SEE A SUPPORTIVE
FAMILY IN THE GALLERY.

21:06.533 --> 21:07.500
- OH.

21:07.534 --> 21:08.568
- HOLD ON.

21:08.601 --> 21:10.470
YOU EXPECT ME TO SIT IN A COURT

21:10.503 --> 21:12.405
TO SHOW A JURY
THAT I SUPPORT HER CHOICES?

21:12.439 --> 21:13.640
NO, THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.708
- BOB, LET'S JUST HEAR THEM OUT.
- HEAR WHAT?

21:15.742 --> 21:16.743
I DON'T CONDONE THIS.

21:16.776 --> 21:18.345
- MR. BARNES...

21:18.378 --> 21:20.480
YOUR DAUGHTER WAS RAPED.

21:20.513 --> 21:23.550
SO WHATEVER CHOICES
SHE MAY HAVE MADE IN THE PAST,

21:23.583 --> 21:25.051
SHE DIDN'T CHOOSE THIS.

21:25.084 --> 21:27.720
- MY DAUGHTER...

21:27.754 --> 21:29.322
IN THOSE VIDEOS.

21:29.356 --> 21:31.358
THAT'S NOT HOW WE RAISED HER.

21:33.793 --> 21:34.994
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

21:35.027 --> 21:37.630
- DADDY, I'M SORRY.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.599
- I TOLD YOU WE
SHOULDN'T HAVE COME HERE.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.334
- MR. BARNES...

21:41.368 --> 21:45.505
YOUR DAUGHTER IS A VICTIM.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.073
- DO YOU KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE UPSTATE?

21:47.106 --> 21:49.876
I CAN'T GO TO CHURCH
OR PUT GAS IN MY TRUCK

21:49.909 --> 21:51.644
WITHOUT PEOPLE STARING AT ME.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.583
DID YOU THINK ABOUT US AT ALL?

22:01.754 --> 22:02.755
[door slams]

22:05.057 --> 22:07.994
- THIS HAS BEEN VERY HARD
ON YOUR FATHER.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.896
- I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE UPSET,

22:09.929 --> 22:12.632
BUT THIS HAS BEEN VERY HARD
ON EVIE AS WELL.

22:12.665 --> 22:14.100
WILL YOU ATTEND THE TRIAL?

22:18.771 --> 22:21.340
- BOB HAS DIALYSIS;
I HAVE TO DRIVE HIM.

22:25.144 --> 22:27.113
I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

22:32.485 --> 22:35.354
EVIE, PLEASE TAKE CARE
OF YOURSELF.

22:44.431 --> 22:49.101
- I'M SO SORRY.

22:49.135 --> 22:52.472
EVIE, YOU OKAY?

22:52.505 --> 22:54.006
- THEY HATE ME.

22:55.107 --> 22:57.777
- THEY DON'T HATE YOU.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.045
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

22:59.078 --> 23:00.480
I DON'T NEED THEM.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.981
I DID NOTHING WRONG,

23:10.657 --> 23:10.857
.

23:10.890 --> 23:11.724
- MS. BARNES, WE'VE SEEN
SOME IMAGES OF YOU

23:12.559 --> 23:15.495
THAT MAY BE UPSETTING
AND CONFUSING.

23:15.528 --> 23:16.963
CAN YOU TELL US
WHY YOU DECIDED TO WORK

23:16.996 --> 23:19.131
IN THE ADULT FILM BUSINESS?

23:19.165 --> 23:21.534
- I NEEDED MONEY
FOR COLLEGE TUITION.

23:21.568 --> 23:23.603
AND WHAT I DID WAS LEGAL
AND REGULATED.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.539
- SO DESPITE HOW IT
MAY APPEAR ON SCREEN,

23:26.573 --> 23:27.907
YOU WERE NEVER ACTUALLY FORCED

23:27.940 --> 23:29.742
TO DO ANYTHING
AGAINST YOUR WILL.

23:29.776 --> 23:30.643
- NO.

23:30.677 --> 23:32.078
I FOLLOWED A SCRIPT.

23:32.111 --> 23:35.181
I CREATED A CHARACTER
SEPARATE FROM MYSELF.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.750
AND WHAT HAPPENED ON SET
WAS AN ACT.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.919
THE VIOLENCE WAS NOT REAL.

23:39.952 --> 23:41.153
- OKAY.

23:41.187 --> 23:42.054
AND HOW WAS THAT DIFFERENT

23:42.088 --> 23:43.790
FROM WHAT HAPPENED
WITH THE DEFENDANT?

23:43.823 --> 23:45.658
- DANIEL AND MATT FORCED ME.

23:45.692 --> 23:48.661
THE VIOLENCE WAS REAL--
AND PAINFUL.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.797
I SAID NO, AND I MEANT NO.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.865
BUT THEY DIDN'T STOP.

23:52.899 --> 23:55.502
THEY TOOK TURNS RAPING ME.

23:55.535 --> 23:56.503
IT WAS HORRIBLE,

23:56.536 --> 23:58.004
AND AT NO POINT DID I CONSENT.

23:58.037 --> 24:00.006
I BEGGED THEM TO STOP.

24:00.039 --> 24:02.509
- CAN YOU TELL US
ABOUT YOUR DECISION

24:02.542 --> 24:04.110
TO TESTIFY HERE TODAY?

24:04.143 --> 24:07.046
- I KNEW I WOULD BE OPENING
MYSELF AND MY FAMILY UP

24:07.079 --> 24:09.749
TO HUMILIATION AND JUDGMENT
FROM OTHERS,

24:09.782 --> 24:12.652
TO SLUT-SHAMING
AND VICTIM-BLAMING.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.621
BUT I CHOSE TO SEND A MESSAGE

24:14.654 --> 24:16.789
THAT PEOPLE WHO WORK
IN ADULT ENTERTAINMENT

24:16.823 --> 24:18.825
ARE STILL PEOPLE,

24:18.858 --> 24:19.926
JUST LIKE ANYONE ELSE.

24:19.959 --> 24:22.695
AND WE DO NOT DESERVE
TO BE SUBJECTED TO ASSAULT.

24:22.729 --> 24:24.531
- THANK YOU, MS. BARNES.

24:27.967 --> 24:31.571
- THAT WAS A TERRIFIC SPEECH,
MS. BARNES.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.940
NOW, CAN WE COME OFF
THE SOAPBOX FOR A MOMENT

24:33.973 --> 24:35.808
AND GO OVER THE TIMELINE?
- OBJECTION.

24:35.842 --> 24:37.209
- MR. BUCHANAN,

24:37.243 --> 24:39.145
I WON'T HAVE THAT ATTITUDE
IN MY COURT.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.947
TREAT THE WITNESS WITH RESPECT.

24:40.980 --> 24:42.815
- OF COURSE, YOUR HONOR.

24:42.849 --> 24:45.217
MS. BARNES, CAN YOU TELL US

24:45.251 --> 24:48.955
ABOUT YOUR FIRST
PORNOGRAPHIC EXPERIENCE?

24:48.988 --> 24:50.657
- IT WAS A CASTING COUCH
AUDITION TAPE.

24:50.690 --> 24:54.026
- 18 WITH A BANG, YES?

24:54.060 --> 24:55.695
CAN YOU ANSWER ALOUD

24:55.728 --> 24:58.097
FOR THE STENOGRAPHER, PLEASE?

24:58.130 --> 24:58.998
- YES.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.233
- AND SUBSEQUENTLY,
YOU STARRED AS...

25:01.267 --> 25:05.304
ROXXXANNE--WITH TRIPLE-Xs--DEMAY

25:05.337 --> 25:07.006
IN 12 ADDITIONAL VIDEOS.

25:07.039 --> 25:07.840
- YES.

25:07.874 --> 25:09.609
- IF YOU WERE DOING
SOMETHING LEGAL,

25:09.642 --> 25:10.977
WHY CHANGE YOUR NAME?

25:11.010 --> 25:13.546
- I WAS CREATING A PERSONA,
A FANTASY.

25:13.580 --> 25:14.681
- A PERSONA...

25:14.714 --> 25:16.983
ONE WHO ENGAGED
IN MULTIPLE SEX ACTS

25:17.016 --> 25:18.585
WITH TWO MEN AT A TIME

25:18.618 --> 25:22.722
IN 12 VIDEOS THAT ARE TAGGED
"RAPE FANTASY."

25:22.755 --> 25:23.723
- YES.

25:23.756 --> 25:24.991
- YOU DIDN'T TELL THE POLICE

25:25.024 --> 25:27.293
THAT YOU HAD DONE
THESE OTHER VIDEOS AT FIRST.

25:27.326 --> 25:28.561
WHY IS THAT?

25:28.595 --> 25:30.262
- I HOPED IT WOULD
REMAIN PRIVATE.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.700
- YOU HOPED IT WOULD
REMAIN PRIVATE...

25:33.733 --> 25:35.702
ON THE INTERNET.

25:37.970 --> 25:39.706
YOU SAY THIS IS YOUR CHOICE.

25:39.739 --> 25:42.809
LET ME ASK,
WHY DID YOU CHOOSE

25:42.842 --> 25:44.811
TO MAKE RAPE FANTASY FILMS?

25:44.844 --> 25:46.679
- THE SPECIALTY GENRES PAY MORE.

25:46.713 --> 25:47.980
- SO THIS IS ABOUT MONEY.

25:48.014 --> 25:51.350
- I NEEDED MONEY
FOR MY COLLEGE TUITION.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.853
- IN THIS VIDEO...

25:53.886 --> 25:56.155
AND IN THE DOZEN
THAT YOU MADE AFTER THAT,

25:56.188 --> 25:57.990
YOU WERE THROWN AROUND,

25:58.024 --> 26:00.259
SLAPPED, VERBALLY DEGRADED,

26:00.292 --> 26:02.194
AND PENETRATED BY TWO MEN

26:02.228 --> 26:04.597
WHILE SCREAMING
AND SAYING, "NO."

26:04.631 --> 26:05.798
- THAT WAS ACTING.

26:05.832 --> 26:06.866
- AH.

26:06.899 --> 26:08.968
AND IN THIS VIDEO,

26:09.001 --> 26:10.770
YOU WERE ALSO THROWN AROUND,

26:10.803 --> 26:12.338
SLAPPED, VERBALLY DEGRADED,

26:12.371 --> 26:14.040
AND PENETRATED BY TWO MEN

26:14.073 --> 26:15.107
WHILE SCREAMING
AND SAYING, "NO."

26:15.141 --> 26:16.108
ISN'T THAT CORRECT?

26:16.142 --> 26:16.976
- YES, BUT I NEVER SAID--

26:17.009 --> 26:19.712
- SO THE MAIN OBJECTIVE
DIFFERENCE IS,

26:19.746 --> 26:22.782
IN THE 13 ADULT VIDEOS
YOU WERE PAID,

26:22.815 --> 26:24.083
BUT IN THIS ONE, YOU WEREN'T.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.652
- NO, I DID NOT WANT
TO BE RAPED.

26:25.685 --> 26:26.653
I SAID NO.

26:26.686 --> 26:28.921
- YOU DID, IN ALL 14 VIDEOS.

26:28.955 --> 26:31.891
SO IT WOULD SEEM THAT...

26:31.924 --> 26:34.193
"NO" MEANS "YES"
WHEN YOU'RE GETTING PAID,

26:34.226 --> 26:35.795
BUT "NO" MEANS "NO"
WHEN YOU'RE NOT.

26:35.828 --> 26:36.796
- OBJECTION.

26:36.829 --> 26:38.130
- I'LL REPHRASE.

26:38.164 --> 26:42.902
WE HAVE SEEN THAT YOU ARE
A VERY GIFTED ACTRESS.

26:42.935 --> 26:47.807
HOW DO EXPECT THESE BOYS
OR THIS JURY

26:47.840 --> 26:48.641
TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE?

26:48.675 --> 26:50.376
- I DIDN'T WANT
WHAT THEY DID TO ME.

26:50.409 --> 26:52.078
- YOU SAY AFTER THE FACT.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.747
YOU DIDN'T CALL THE POLICE
THAT NIGHT.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.382
I'M CURIOUS.

26:56.415 --> 26:59.085
IS THE REASON YOU CRIED RAPE

26:59.118 --> 27:01.688
THE NEXT DAY
WHEN THE POLICE SHOWED UP

27:01.721 --> 27:02.789
BECAUSE YOU WERE EMBARRASSED

27:02.822 --> 27:05.257
THAT YOU HAD BEEN CAUGHT
IN A COMPROMISING POSITION?

27:05.291 --> 27:09.128
OR WAS IT BECAUSE
THESE BOYS DIDN'T PAY YOU?

27:09.161 --> 27:10.997
- AGAIN, YOUR HONOR, OBJECTION.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.164
- SUSTAINED.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.733
- NOTHING FURTHER.

27:16.903 --> 27:19.305
OH, AND, MS. BARNES,

27:19.338 --> 27:23.676
I'M SORRY IF IT FEELS
LIKE I WAS ROUGH ON YOU,

27:23.710 --> 27:26.779
BUT THAT'S WHAT
I GET PAID TO DO.

27:26.813 --> 27:28.748
- THE JURY WILL DISREGARD.

27:28.781 --> 27:32.084
MR. BUCHANAN,
I WON'T WARN YOU AGAIN.

27:40.993 --> 27:43.229
- THE WORST IS OVER.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.864
SO TOMORROW YOU CAN
TAKE IT EASY.

27:44.897 --> 27:46.699
LET A.D.A. BARBA DO HIS JOB.

27:46.733 --> 27:49.769
- NO, I WANT TO BE THERE
WHEN DANIEL TESTIFIES,

27:49.802 --> 27:52.238
MAKE HIM LOOK AT ME.

27:52.271 --> 27:54.006
- YOU WANT US TO WALK YOU UP?

27:54.040 --> 27:56.108
- NO, I'M A BIG GIRL.

27:56.142 --> 27:57.844
BUT THANKS.

27:57.877 --> 27:58.811
NIGHT.

28:04.851 --> 28:07.119
- DANIEL TOLD ME THAT WE WERE
GOING TO DO A FILM WITH EVIE

28:07.153 --> 28:08.721
AND THAT SHE WAS COOL WITH IT.

28:08.755 --> 28:11.824
EVEN IF SHE RESISTED,
THAT WAS PART OF THE ACT.

28:11.858 --> 28:13.726
- YOU BELIEVED HIM?
- I DID.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.795
BUT SHE WAS CRYING
THE WHOLE TIME,

28:15.828 --> 28:17.730
AND SHE RAN OUT AFTER.

28:17.764 --> 28:20.767
THAT'S WHEN DANIEL TOLD ME
THAT WE'D ACTUALLY RAPED HER,

28:20.800 --> 28:23.135
BUT THAT IF ANYONE ASKED,
SHE WANTED IT.

28:23.169 --> 28:24.503
- DOES THAT MEAN, IN FACT,
THAT MS. BARNES

28:24.536 --> 28:26.739
NEVER CONSENTED
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU?

28:26.773 --> 28:27.907
- NO.

28:27.940 --> 28:30.076
THE TWO OF US RAPED HER.

28:30.109 --> 28:32.745
I FEEL SICK ABOUT IT.

28:32.779 --> 28:35.114
I'M SORRY, EVIE.

28:40.519 --> 28:44.323
- MR. COOPER,
IS IT TRUE YOU TOOK A PLEA DEAL

28:44.356 --> 28:46.793
IN EXCHANGE FOR YOUR TESTIMONY?

28:46.826 --> 28:47.894
- YES.

28:47.927 --> 28:52.331
- YOU WERE CHARGED WITH
MISDEMEANOR SEXUAL ASSAULT.

28:52.364 --> 28:53.866
YOU FACE, AT A MAXIMUM,

28:53.900 --> 28:55.902
ONE YEAR IN PRISON
OR MAYBE NO TIME AT ALL,

28:55.935 --> 29:00.339
INSTEAD OF THE 5 TO 25
YOU WERE FACING FOR RAPE I.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.507
IS THAT THE DEAL YOU MADE?

29:01.540 --> 29:02.741
- YES.

29:02.775 --> 29:07.046
- AT FIRST, YOU THOUGHT THE
ENTIRE ENCOUNTER WITH MS. BARNES

29:07.079 --> 29:08.280
WAS CONSENSUAL?

29:08.314 --> 29:09.782
- DANIEL HAD TOLD ME IT WAS.

29:09.816 --> 29:12.551
- AND SHE HAD RESPONDED
THE SAME WAY SHE DID

29:12.584 --> 29:15.387
IN THE 18 WITH A BANG VIDEO
YOU HAD SEEN.

29:15.421 --> 29:16.555
WAS THAT PART OF IT?

29:16.588 --> 29:17.523
- I GUESS.

29:17.556 --> 29:20.359
- AND WHEN THE POLICE
FIRST TALKED TO YOU,

29:20.392 --> 29:23.395
YOU TOLD THEM
THAT IT WAS CONSENSUAL.

29:23.429 --> 29:25.231
BUT NOW THAT YOU'RE
A PROSECUTION WITNESS

29:25.264 --> 29:26.398
WITH A GENEROUS DEAL,

29:26.432 --> 29:27.900
YOU'RE CALLING IT RAPE?

29:27.934 --> 29:29.969
DOES THAT SOUND ACCURATE,
MR. COOPER?

29:30.002 --> 29:32.438
- I GUESS, BUT THAT WASN'T
WHEN I--

29:32.471 --> 29:34.540
- YOU SEEM LIKE
A THOUGHTFUL YOUNG MAN.

29:34.573 --> 29:36.809
THESE DAYS,
COLLEGE IS A CONFUSING PLACE

29:36.843 --> 29:39.311
TO EXPERIMENT WITH SEXUALITY.

29:39.345 --> 29:40.579
THIS WAS YOUR FIRST THREESOME,

29:40.612 --> 29:41.981
CROSSING LINES
YOU'D NEVER CROSSED.

29:42.014 --> 29:43.850
- IS THERE A QUESTION,
YOUR HONOR,

29:43.883 --> 29:46.318
OR IS COUNSELOR BUCHANAN
ON HIS SOAPBOX NOW?

29:46.352 --> 29:49.421
- GET TO IT, MR. BUCHANAN.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.590
- MR. COOPER...

29:51.623 --> 29:55.895
IF YOU WEREN'T SURE AT THE TIME
ABOUT WHAT HAD HAPPENED,

29:55.928 --> 29:56.896
AND YOU HAVE SAID UNDER OATH

29:56.929 --> 29:58.931
THAT YOU DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS RAPE AT FIRST,

29:58.965 --> 30:02.168
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE
THAT YOU'RE NOT SURE, EVEN NOW?

30:02.201 --> 30:03.535
- I DON'T KNOW.

30:03.569 --> 30:06.505
I MEAN, I GUESS,
BUT SHE SAYS IT WAS,

30:06.538 --> 30:07.874
SO I THINK THAT--

30:07.907 --> 30:09.375
- WELL PUT.

30:09.408 --> 30:10.576
THANK YOU.

30:14.881 --> 30:16.282
- REDIRECT, YOUR HONOR?

30:16.315 --> 30:17.583
- I'LL ALLOW.

30:17.616 --> 30:20.452
- MR. COOPER, YES OR NO:

30:20.486 --> 30:23.155
DID YOU AND THE DEFENDANT
DANIEL PRYOR RAPE EVIE BARNES?

30:24.991 --> 30:27.393
- YES.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.161
WE DID.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.863
- THANK YOU.

30:40.172 --> 30:42.341
- WHEN MATT TOLD ME
EVIE WANTED TO DO A THREE-WAY,

30:42.374 --> 30:43.575
I WAS FLATTERED.

30:43.609 --> 30:46.145
I HAD NEVER EVEN MET
A PORN STAR BEFORE.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.980
IN THE BATHROOM,
SHE WAS ACTING

30:48.014 --> 30:49.916
JUST LIKE SHE DID
IN THE VIDEO WE SAW.

30:49.949 --> 30:51.884
- ALTHOUGH ADVISED OTHERWISE,

30:51.918 --> 30:54.120
WHY HAVE YOU CHOSEN
TO TAKE THE STAND TODAY?

30:56.555 --> 30:59.125
- I WANT TO SPEAK
FOR ALL FALSELY ACCUSED MEN.

30:59.158 --> 31:00.626
PEOPLE BELIEVE WOMEN BY DEFAULT,

31:00.659 --> 31:05.097
BUT FALSE ACCUSATIONS
DESTROY LIVES.

31:05.131 --> 31:06.632
SERIOUSLY, I JUST--

31:06.665 --> 31:09.601
I DON'T KNOW WHY
THIS IS HAPPENING TO ME.

31:09.635 --> 31:11.470
- NOTHING FURTHER.

31:13.672 --> 31:15.341
- DID YOU EVER ASK MS. BARNES

31:15.374 --> 31:17.109
IF SHE WANTED
TO HAVE SEX WITH YOU?

31:17.143 --> 31:18.544
- NO, MATT DID.

31:18.577 --> 31:19.611
I TRUSTED MATT.

31:19.645 --> 31:20.947
MAYBE THAT WAS MY MISTAKE.

31:20.980 --> 31:22.915
- THEN ALL YOU ACTUALLY
HEARD HER SAY

31:22.949 --> 31:23.649
WAS, "NO," AND, "STOP,"

31:23.682 --> 31:25.551
AND YOU DIDN'T.

31:25.584 --> 31:27.286
- SHE SAID, "NO,"
ALL THOSE OTHER TIMES

31:27.319 --> 31:29.221
AND STILL HAD SEX, SO...

31:29.255 --> 31:30.222
WHY WOULD THIS BE DIFFERENT?

31:30.256 --> 31:31.323
WE WERE FILMING A SCENE.

31:31.357 --> 31:34.460
- BUT SHE SAID, "NO,"
CORRECT?

31:34.493 --> 31:37.629
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT ANY WOMAN,
EVEN A PORN STAR,

31:37.663 --> 31:39.298
CAN DECLINE SEX?

31:39.331 --> 31:40.499
- OF COURSE, I--

31:40.532 --> 31:41.700
- SO LET'S BE CLEAR.

31:41.733 --> 31:45.071
DID MS. BARNES SAY, "NO"?

31:45.104 --> 31:46.105
- SHE DID.

31:46.138 --> 31:47.539
- IN FACT, SHE CRIED.

31:47.573 --> 31:49.608
SHE BEGGED YOU TO STOP
REPEATEDLY.

31:49.641 --> 31:50.943
ISN'T THAT CORRECT?

31:50.977 --> 31:52.011
- WELL, YEAH, BUT--

31:52.044 --> 31:53.512
- YOU DIDN'T STOP, DID YOU?

31:53.545 --> 31:54.613
- NO.

31:54.646 --> 31:56.015
- DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT
WHAT YOU HAVE JUST DESCRIBED

31:56.048 --> 31:58.484
IS THE DEFINITION OF RAPE?

32:14.300 --> 32:14.500
.

32:14.533 --> 32:15.534
- MEMBERS OF THE JURY,
HAVE YOU REACHED A VERDICT?

32:17.336 --> 32:19.171
- WE HAVE, YOUR HONOR.

32:19.205 --> 32:20.139
- WHAT SAY YOU?

32:20.172 --> 32:23.275
- ON THE CHARGE OF RAPE
IN THE FIRST DEGREE,

32:23.309 --> 32:26.212
WE FIND THE DEFENDANT
DANIEL PRYOR GUILTY.

32:26.245 --> 32:29.181
[courtroom murmurs]

32:29.215 --> 32:31.150
- CONGRATULATIONS.

32:31.183 --> 32:33.152
- THANK YOU.
- CONGRATULATIONS.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.253
- LADIES AND GENTLEMEN
OF THE JURY,

32:34.286 --> 32:38.424
THE STATE OF NEW YORK
THANKS YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.

32:38.457 --> 32:42.294
MR. PRYOR, YOU WILL REMAIN
OUT ON BAIL UNTIL SENTENCING.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.230
- YOUR HONOR,
I'D LIKE TO FILE A MOTION

32:44.263 --> 32:45.764
TO SET ASIDE THIS VERDICT.

32:45.797 --> 32:47.166
- SO NOTED.

32:47.199 --> 32:49.201
I'LL RESERVE JUDGMENT
UNTIL SENTENCING.

32:49.235 --> 32:50.402
[gavel bangs]

32:50.436 --> 32:51.537
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

32:51.570 --> 32:52.638
- IT'S PRO FORMA.

32:52.671 --> 32:54.173
- IF THE JURY REACHES A VERDICT,

32:54.206 --> 32:55.341
JUDGES DON'T OVERTURN IT.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.076
NICE WORK.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.177
- THANK YOU.

32:59.245 --> 33:00.646
- EVIE BARNES...

33:00.679 --> 33:01.747
- YES?

33:01.780 --> 33:03.215
- YOU'VE BEEN SERVED.

33:03.249 --> 33:06.252
- WHAT IS THAT?

33:06.285 --> 33:07.553
- OH, MY GOD.

33:07.586 --> 33:10.256
IT'S FROM THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE
AT HUDSON.

33:10.289 --> 33:13.192
I'M BEING EXPELLED FOR VIOLATING
THE CODE OF CONDUCT?

33:13.225 --> 33:14.193
- NO, THEY CAN'T DO THAT.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.394
- THEY JUST DID.

33:15.427 --> 33:18.130
I HAVE TO MOVE OUT
BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK.

33:25.671 --> 33:27.406
- SORRY TO KEEP YOU WAITING.

33:27.439 --> 33:29.441
I UNDERSTAND YOU NEEDED
TO SEE ME RIGHT AWAY?

33:29.475 --> 33:31.610
- YES, I, UH,
I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED,

33:31.643 --> 33:35.681
AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN
CLARIFY A MATTER ON EVIE BARNES.

33:35.714 --> 33:38.284
NOW, YOU'RE
THE UNIVERSITY PRESIDENT,

33:38.317 --> 33:43.322
AND YOU EXPELLED A RAPE VICTIM.

33:43.355 --> 33:44.456
WHAT ABOUT THE RAPISTS?

33:44.490 --> 33:48.227
- PENDING HIS APPEAL,
DANIEL MAY WELL BE EXPELLED TOO.

33:48.260 --> 33:50.296
AND EVIE BARNES WASN'T EXPELLED

33:50.329 --> 33:51.797
BECAUSE SHE MADE
A RAPE ACCUSATION.

33:51.830 --> 33:53.332
I WANT TO BE PERFECTLY CLEAR
ABOUT THAT.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.633
- I'M SURE YOU DO.

33:54.666 --> 33:57.636
- SHE BLATANTLY VIOLATED
HUDSON'S CODE OF CONDUCT.

33:57.669 --> 34:00.506
SHE CHOSE TO APPEAR
IN VIOLENT PORNOGRAPHIC VIDEOS.

34:00.539 --> 34:03.342
SHE EVEN SHOWED HER STUDENT I.D.
IN SOME OF THEM.

34:03.375 --> 34:05.677
HER PRESENCE ON CAMPUS
IS DISRUPTIVE.

34:05.711 --> 34:07.579
- BUT THE PRESENCE OF RAPISTS
IS OKAY.

34:11.483 --> 34:12.384
- I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

34:12.418 --> 34:15.221
THERE HAVE BEEN
AS MANY FALSE ACCUSATIONS

34:15.254 --> 34:16.488
AS ONES THAT HAVE PROVED TRUE.

34:16.522 --> 34:18.290
THERE'S BAD JUDGMENT
ON BOTH SIDES.

34:18.324 --> 34:21.193
- BAD JUDGMENT ON BOTH SIDES.

34:21.227 --> 34:23.095
I THINK WE BOTH KNOW
THAT THAT'S CODE

34:23.129 --> 34:24.296
FOR VICTIM-BLAMING.

34:24.330 --> 34:26.565
- HUDSON UNIVERSITY
IS FULLY COMMITTED

34:26.598 --> 34:28.167
TO SEXUAL VIOLENCE PREVENTION.

34:28.200 --> 34:29.435
- OH...
- WE'RE PLANNING A LUNCHEON

34:29.468 --> 34:31.570
EARLY NEXT WEEK ON THE SUBJECT.

34:31.603 --> 34:33.539
- WELL...

34:33.572 --> 34:35.407
I LOOK FORWARD
TO SEEING THE CAKE.

34:35.441 --> 34:37.576
- I UNDERSTAND YOUR PASSION
ON THIS SUBJECT,

34:37.609 --> 34:39.611
AND I PROMISE YOU
THAT HUDSON UNIVERSITY,

34:39.645 --> 34:42.781
NYPD, AND THE MAYOR'S OFFICE
HAVE ALWAYS HAD

34:42.814 --> 34:45.184
A MUTUALLY RESPECTFUL
RELATIONSHIP.

34:45.217 --> 34:47.253
- PLEASE DON'T HIDE
BEHIND THE MAYOR'S SKIRT.

34:50.689 --> 34:53.759
LOOK...

34:53.792 --> 34:56.362
I'M ASKING YOU
TO DO THE RIGHT THING,

34:56.395 --> 34:58.230
FOR EVIE'S SAKE.

35:00.366 --> 35:03.669
I'M SURE THAT YOU
CAN FIND ANOTHER WAY.

35:13.645 --> 35:16.915
- DANIEL PRYOR, PLEASE RISE.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.351
BEFORE I SPEAK TO YOUR
SENTENCING AND OTHER MOTIONS,

35:19.385 --> 35:21.320
I UNDERSTAND YOU'D LIKE
TO MAKE A STATEMENT.

35:21.353 --> 35:23.289
- YOUR HONOR,
I'D LIKE TO APOLOGIZE

35:23.322 --> 35:25.524
TO MY FAMILY AND MY SCHOOL

35:25.557 --> 35:28.260
FOR ANY EMBARRASSMENT
I'VE CAUSED THEM.

35:28.294 --> 35:29.661
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT
IS SOMETHING

35:29.695 --> 35:31.363
MY FRIEND MATT, EVIE, AND I

35:31.397 --> 35:34.766
WILL HAVE TO LIVE WITH
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.702
I SHOWED POOR JUDGMENT.

35:36.735 --> 35:38.904
AND I KNOW,
IF GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE,

35:38.937 --> 35:43.275
I WOULD NEVER DO ANYTHING
TO DISHONOR ANOTHER WOMAN AGAIN.

35:43.309 --> 35:44.643
THANK YOU.

35:44.676 --> 35:46.312
- THANK YOU.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.414
I SEE GENUINE REMORSE HERE.

35:50.249 --> 35:53.252
WHAT I DID NOT SEE
DURING THE TRIAL, HOWEVER,

35:53.285 --> 35:54.720
IS BEHAVIOR RISING TO THE LEVEL

35:54.753 --> 35:57.656
OF THE CRIMINAL CHARGES
BROUGHT AGAINST YOU.

35:57.689 --> 36:00.759
- EXCUSE ME, YOUR HONOR?

36:00.792 --> 36:02.828
- I DO NOT DO THIS LIGHTLY.

36:07.266 --> 36:11.303
DUE TO THE LACK
OF SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE,

36:11.337 --> 36:12.571
I ACCEPT THE DEFENSE'S MOTION

36:12.604 --> 36:14.640
TO SET ASIDE
THE JURY'S GUILTY VERDICT.

36:16.842 --> 36:17.943
- WHAT'S HE DOING?

36:17.976 --> 36:20.279
- YOUR HONOR, THIS IS AN
OUTRAGEOUS ABUSE OF YOUR POWER.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.347
- MR. BARBA.

36:21.380 --> 36:23.249
- THERE IS NO BASIS
TO OVERTURN THIS CONVICTION.

36:23.282 --> 36:25.517
HER TESTIMONY,
THE CORROBORATOR'S TESTIMONY--

36:25.551 --> 36:26.618
- YOU DON'T NEED
TO APPROACH THE BENCH.

36:26.652 --> 36:28.954
- YOUR HONOR, YOU ARE MAKING
A FACTUAL DETERMINATION.

36:28.987 --> 36:30.456
THAT IS THE JURY'S JOB,
NOT YOURS!

36:30.489 --> 36:33.259
- SIT DOWN, MR. BARBA.

36:46.372 --> 36:48.240
YOUNG LADY...

36:48.274 --> 36:49.675
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU DESIRE

36:49.708 --> 36:52.578
THE RECENTLY POPULAR STATUS
OF VICTIMHOOD

36:52.611 --> 36:56.515
OR IF THIS WAS A PUBLICITY STUNT
TO JUMPSTART YOUR PORN CAREER,

36:56.548 --> 36:58.984
BUT GIVEN THE EVIDENCE,

36:59.017 --> 37:01.787
THERE IS NO WAY TO CONCLUDE
BEYOND REASONABLE DOUBT

37:01.820 --> 37:06.358
THAT YOUR "NO" IN THIS INCIDENT
TRULY MEANT "NO."

37:06.392 --> 37:08.427
I HOPE, GOING FORWARD,
YOU FIND A WAY

37:08.460 --> 37:10.562
TO RESPECT YOUR BODY
AND YOURSELF.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.331
- NO, I WASN'T LYING!

37:12.364 --> 37:13.665
- WHAT YOU ARE DOING
IS GIVING MEN PERMISSION

37:13.699 --> 37:15.867
TO ASSAULT A WOMAN
BASED ON HER SEXUAL HISTORY.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.270
YOU'RE SETTING THE CLOCK BACK
ON RAPE LAW 50 YEARS.

37:18.304 --> 37:19.338
- LAST WARNING, MR. BARBA.

37:19.371 --> 37:20.606
I WILL HOLD YOU IN CONTEMPT.

37:20.639 --> 37:22.308
- I'M MAKING AN IMMEDIATE MOTION
TO APPEAL.

37:22.341 --> 37:24.343
- AS IS YOUR PREROGATIVE.

37:29.047 --> 37:31.783
MR. PRYOR, YOU ARE FREE TO GO.

37:47.733 --> 37:47.933
.

37:47.966 --> 37:48.767
- HOW CAN A JUDGE
OVERTURN A VERDICT?

37:50.569 --> 37:52.638
- IT'S CALLED "JUDGMENT
NOTWITHSTANDING THE VERDICT."

37:52.671 --> 37:54.072
IT'S PRETTY UNCOMMON,
BUT IT DOES HAPPEN.

37:54.105 --> 37:56.007
- YEAH, IT MAKES YOU WONDER
WHAT THE POINT OF A JURY IS.

37:56.041 --> 37:57.843
- HOW'S EVIE?
- NOT GOOD.

37:57.876 --> 37:59.778
- SERGEANT.

37:59.811 --> 38:02.013
- CHIEF.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.081
MY OFFICE?

38:03.114 --> 38:05.551
- UNLESS YOU WANT
YOUR WHOLE SQUAD TO HEAR THIS.

38:11.423 --> 38:12.724
- LET ME GUESS.

38:12.758 --> 38:14.826
YOU GOT A CALL FROM HUDSON.

38:17.729 --> 38:18.830
- I DID.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.699
THEY WANT TO KNOW
WHY AN SVU SERGEANT

38:20.732 --> 38:22.701
IS DEMANDING
THEY REEVALUATE SCHOOL POLICY.

38:22.734 --> 38:24.970
- BECAUSE THEY EXPELLED
EVIE BARNES,

38:25.003 --> 38:27.873
WHICH CONSTITUTES
VICTIM-BLAMING.

38:27.906 --> 38:29.541
IT'S EGREGIOUS BEHAVIOR.

38:29.575 --> 38:30.842
- THAT MAY BE YOUR OPINION,

38:30.876 --> 38:32.611
BUT IT'S THEIR DECISION.

38:32.644 --> 38:37.783
IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU,
SVU, OR NYPD.

38:37.816 --> 38:40.051
STAY OUT OF
THE PRESIDENT'S OFFICE.

38:41.787 --> 38:44.723
- DOES YOUR CONCERN
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

38:44.756 --> 38:46.525
WITH THE FACT
THAT HUDSON UNIVERSITY

38:46.558 --> 38:49.828
IS NEW YORK CITY'S
LARGEST LANDLORD?

38:51.730 --> 38:53.399
- GROW UP, SERGEANT.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.002
YOU ARE GOOD AT YOUR JOB.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.470
STICK TO THAT.

38:58.504 --> 39:01.072
IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE POLICY,

39:01.106 --> 39:02.774
GET INTO POLITICS.

39:02.808 --> 39:05.977
BUT THE LAST TIME I CHECKED...

39:06.011 --> 39:07.746
YOU'RE A COP.

39:09.548 --> 39:10.749
- YES, SIR.

39:14.586 --> 39:15.554
- SERGEANT.

39:15.587 --> 39:16.755
- WHAT?

39:16.788 --> 39:19.391
- EVIE'S MOM IS HERE.

39:19.425 --> 39:20.726
- EVIE NEVER CAME HOME TODAY,

39:20.759 --> 39:22.828
AND SHE'S NOT ANSWERING
HER CELL.

39:22.861 --> 39:23.795
- AND YOU CHECKED
HER DORM ROOM?

39:23.829 --> 39:25.764
- HER R.A. LET ME IN.

39:25.797 --> 39:27.699
THE DOOR WAS COVERED
WITH GRAFFITI:

39:27.733 --> 39:31.737
"SLUT," "WHORE."

39:31.770 --> 39:34.806
SHE LEFT HER CLOTHES,
HER BOOKS, EVERYTHING.

39:34.840 --> 39:37.008
HER COMPUTER WAS OPEN
ON HER DESK.

39:43.214 --> 39:44.450
[click]

40:17.983 --> 40:21.019
- OKAY, MRS. BARNES.

40:21.052 --> 40:22.788
IS THERE ANY PLACE
THAT YOU CAN THINK OF

40:22.821 --> 40:24.590
WHERE EVIE MAY HAVE GONE?

40:26.858 --> 40:27.993
- SHE TOLD ME THIS SUMMER

40:28.026 --> 40:31.697
THAT SHE WAS SPENDING TIME
WITH FRIENDS IN NEW ENGLAND.

40:31.730 --> 40:32.998
- NEW HAMPSHIRE?

40:40.271 --> 40:42.608
HEY, WE'RE LOOKING
FOR EVIE BARNES.

40:42.641 --> 40:43.609
- WHO?

40:43.642 --> 40:44.910
- ROXXXANNE DEMAY.
IS SHE HERE?

40:44.943 --> 40:46.912
- RELAX, SHE'S 18.
WE'RE LEGAL.

40:46.945 --> 40:49.214
- I KNOW.
WE JUST WANT TO TALK TO HER.

40:49.247 --> 40:51.016
- EVIE.

40:51.049 --> 40:51.983
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

40:52.017 --> 40:54.820
- HEY, YOUR PARENTS
ARE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

40:54.853 --> 40:57.523
- I'M FINE. I'M JUST DOING
WHAT I DO BEST.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.593
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE HERE.

41:01.627 --> 41:02.994
CAN WE TAKE YOU HOME?

41:03.028 --> 41:04.796
- WHERE SHOULD I BE?

41:04.830 --> 41:06.498
AT HUDSON?

41:06.532 --> 41:08.767
TRY BEING A SWEET CO-ED AGAIN?

41:08.800 --> 41:10.936
I ALREADY MADE THAT VIDEO.

41:10.969 --> 41:13.505
AT LEAST HERE,
WHEN I SAY, "STOP,"

41:13.539 --> 41:16.975
THEY STOP.

41:17.008 --> 41:19.545
- THERE--
THERE ARE OTHER SCHOOLS.

41:19.578 --> 41:20.779
Y-YOU WENT THROUGH ALL THIS

41:20.812 --> 41:22.748
TO GET TO COLLEGE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

41:22.781 --> 41:25.617
- TURNED OUT GREAT, DIDN'T IT?

41:25.651 --> 41:27.753
ONCE YOU'RE ROXXXANNE DEMAY,

41:27.786 --> 41:29.755
YOU CAN'T BE EVIE BARNES AGAIN.

41:29.788 --> 41:31.657
- ROXXXANNE.

41:31.690 --> 41:33.725
ROXXXANNE.

41:33.759 --> 41:35.093
WE'RE READY.

41:37.963 --> 41:39.898
- YOU WANT TO WATCH?

41:39.931 --> 41:42.100
WATCH.

41:42.133 --> 41:44.035
EVERYONE ELSE WILL.

41:46.171 --> 41:48.506
- EVIE...
- AMANDA, WALK AWAY.

42:04.956 --> 42:06.792
IT'S NOT OUR CHOICE.

42:06.825 --> 42:10.696
[busy background chatter]
