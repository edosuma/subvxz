00:05.523 --> 00:07.325
(radio stations changing)

00:07.358 --> 00:09.760
ALTON (over radio): Irene Abe
was murdered by the CIA.

00:09.794 --> 00:12.163
-I'm about to drop one on you.
-(muffled groan)

00:12.197 --> 00:13.598
ALTON:
He goes by the alias

00:13.631 --> 00:15.666
Reed Thompson.

00:15.700 --> 00:17.135
I even know his real name,

00:17.168 --> 00:18.636
and I got pictures,

00:18.669 --> 00:20.771
and I'm about to put that out
in the public

00:20.805 --> 00:22.840
-so the world can see.
-TEDDY: He is threatening

00:22.873 --> 00:25.110
to release my real name!

00:25.143 --> 00:27.145
HAVEMEYER: You're out,
and not just from the op.

00:27.178 --> 00:29.980
This is the end of your career
in the CIA.

00:30.014 --> 00:31.516
TEDDY (whispering):
Always have an exit plan.

00:31.549 --> 00:34.119
Watch your back

00:34.152 --> 00:35.986
'cause they don't care
about you.

00:36.020 --> 00:38.189
I really thought this was
the beginning of something.

00:38.223 --> 00:40.291
HAVEMEYER:
Just wanted to let you know,

00:40.325 --> 00:41.826
I'm still vetting the possibles,

00:41.859 --> 00:44.362
but I should have someone here
to replace Teddy by next week.

00:44.395 --> 00:46.464
I'd like to increase the buy.

00:46.497 --> 00:47.998
300 keys per week.

00:47.998 --> 00:50.801
You're making your country,
and your countrymen, very happy.

00:50.835 --> 00:52.503
Don't get too happy just yet.

00:52.503 --> 00:54.004
Hello? Morning.

00:54.038 --> 00:56.807
LADWP. You're,
uh, Grady Williamson?

00:56.841 --> 00:58.843
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just, uh, just one second.

00:58.876 --> 01:02.813
Justin. 335685.

01:02.847 --> 01:05.015
90% of how I spend my time now

01:05.015 --> 01:07.185
is being in real estate
with you.

01:07.218 --> 01:09.687
Grady's on our side,

01:09.687 --> 01:11.689
legit business with us.

01:11.689 --> 01:13.524
Got to make it count.

01:14.859 --> 01:16.394
VERONIQUE:
I need you to swear to me that

01:16.427 --> 01:18.729
until the day comes you can
walk away, you'll do everything

01:18.763 --> 01:20.998
you have to do
to make sure our baby,

01:21.031 --> 01:22.500
this family,

01:22.533 --> 01:24.502
is safe and protected.

01:24.535 --> 01:27.071
-Just behind that...
-(gunshot)

01:27.104 --> 01:29.874
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.

01:34.044 --> 01:35.713
(silverware clinking)

01:35.746 --> 01:37.548
(indistinct chatter)

01:43.388 --> 01:45.890
So, the numbers are
gonna be in by Thursday.

01:45.890 --> 01:48.393
We'll have a budget to you
by next week at the earliest.

01:48.426 --> 01:50.728
-Hey, I'm gonna use
the bathroom.
-Okay.

01:55.065 --> 01:56.567
(Havemeyer sighs)

01:58.603 --> 02:00.571
TEDDY:
Yeah, you know, I've just been

02:00.605 --> 02:02.106
taking care of a few things
I let slide

02:02.139 --> 02:05.410
over the last few years.
Traveling. That sort of thing.

02:05.443 --> 02:07.278
Resting, I hope.

02:08.913 --> 02:11.249
TEDDY:
Yeah. There's nothing like

02:11.282 --> 02:13.418
some real R&R to get your head
straightened out.

02:13.451 --> 02:14.552
It's funny,

02:14.585 --> 02:16.621
I can't picture you

02:16.654 --> 02:18.256
at a vacation resort.

02:20.958 --> 02:22.393
TEDDY:
You were right.

02:22.427 --> 02:25.563
I probably had been in
a little too long.

02:25.596 --> 02:27.732
Needed a breather.

02:27.765 --> 02:29.267
I probably should've taken
your advice sooner, but...

02:31.269 --> 02:34.272
So, now, here we are.

02:34.305 --> 02:36.841
Sitting in a restaurant
you followed me to.

02:38.609 --> 02:39.944
So, the thing is,
I've been talking

02:39.977 --> 02:41.579
to some of my old contacts,
you know?

02:41.612 --> 02:43.948
Trying to figure out what comes
next, including a few in Tehran.

02:43.981 --> 02:46.751
That supposed to mean
something to me?

02:46.784 --> 02:48.953
I know what's going on
over there,

02:48.953 --> 02:50.788
and I know it's not going well.

02:50.821 --> 02:53.791
I'm sorry, I don't know
what we're talking about.

02:53.824 --> 02:57.295
Great. Um, in that case,

02:57.328 --> 02:59.264
maybe just...

02:59.297 --> 03:02.267
tell your boss that you have...

03:02.300 --> 03:04.435
a possible asset

03:04.469 --> 03:06.471
who knows about
the seven American hostages,

03:06.504 --> 03:08.473
who also happens to have spent

03:08.506 --> 03:10.007
three years in Tehran.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.977
Okay, what if I did know what

03:13.010 --> 03:15.780
you were referring to?

03:15.813 --> 03:18.816
What exactly are you suggesting?

03:22.219 --> 03:24.455
I'm suggesting

03:24.489 --> 03:26.657
that I know the region,

03:26.691 --> 03:30.295
I'm officially out
of the agency, and I might be

03:30.328 --> 03:32.497
of great value to you.

03:32.530 --> 03:34.499
It's a club soda.

03:36.501 --> 03:37.702
(drink pouring)

03:37.735 --> 03:39.837
Let's say we could use
someone like yourself

03:39.837 --> 03:42.840
in a limited capacity,
is being back on mission

03:42.873 --> 03:44.375
really the best use
of your time?

03:44.409 --> 03:46.677
-As opposed to what?
-I was thinking about

03:46.677 --> 03:49.880
Julia and Paul.
You know, your wife and kid?

03:53.751 --> 03:55.586
TEDDY:
Yeah, they're fine. Thanks.

03:57.422 --> 03:58.823
Country needs me now.

03:58.856 --> 04:00.658
Anyway...

04:00.691 --> 04:02.159
I'm gonna be
at the InterContinental

04:02.192 --> 04:03.160
for the next few days,

04:03.193 --> 04:06.531
just in case you want to talk.

04:10.200 --> 04:12.337
It was really good to see you.

04:12.370 --> 04:13.604
Same to you.

04:24.715 --> 04:26.717
*

04:33.290 --> 04:35.893
AVI: Look, just admit
it can't be worth it.

04:35.926 --> 04:38.763
This is a torch, and I can use
this torch if you want.

04:38.796 --> 04:40.598
-TEDDY: Avi.
-And I cannot.

04:42.767 --> 04:45.269
-(shouting in German)
-Shut the fuck up!

04:46.771 --> 04:47.905
Will you?

04:50.240 --> 04:52.410
I told you, the Iranian

04:52.443 --> 04:54.078
Revolutionary Guard
can't be trusted.

04:54.111 --> 04:56.414
-They've confiscated them all.
-Who the hell is that?

04:56.414 --> 04:57.882
Possible Nazi, never mind that.

04:57.915 --> 04:59.750
I paid the guards off, and they

04:59.750 --> 05:01.886
-fucked us just the same.
-You're saying that you

05:01.919 --> 05:04.288
bribed the Revolutionary Guard,
and they're still screwing us?

05:04.321 --> 05:06.056
-A substantial bribe.
-And the hostages?

05:06.090 --> 05:08.058
The Iranians say

05:08.092 --> 05:09.727
that Hezbollah

05:09.760 --> 05:11.095
-kept changing the terms.
-Oh, my God.

05:11.128 --> 05:13.398
These fucking people.

05:13.431 --> 05:15.400
You can't trust them.
I mean, they're all playing us.

05:15.433 --> 05:17.101
You're telling me.

05:17.134 --> 05:20.771
Hey, what about my,
uh, my commission?

05:22.440 --> 05:24.409
All right.
I'll handle the Iranians.

05:24.442 --> 05:27.244
-Get rid of the Nazi.
-It's a possible Nazi.

05:27.277 --> 05:29.647
If he's innocent, he walks away.

05:29.680 --> 05:31.982
What the hell else
am I supposed to do

05:32.016 --> 05:35.252
stuck in the land
of my people's genocide?

05:35.285 --> 05:37.822
You don't go to Paris
and not get a croissant, right?

05:37.855 --> 05:40.991
-(speaking German)
-I am back, mein kommandant.

05:41.025 --> 05:43.661
Tell me, do you remember
the name of your wife today?

05:43.694 --> 05:46.797
Now, in this minute.

05:46.797 --> 05:48.799
(continues in foreign language)

05:48.799 --> 05:50.167
TEDDY:
Hezbollah and Iran

05:50.200 --> 05:52.336
are both cheating us.

05:52.369 --> 05:54.439
Everybody's making money here,
except for the U.S.

05:54.472 --> 05:56.607
Still, you got no hostages
being released.

05:56.641 --> 05:58.676
Some of the missile profits
are going to the Contras.

05:58.709 --> 06:00.144
Yeah, a few million,

06:00.177 --> 06:02.613
which is not making a dent,
let me tell you.

06:02.647 --> 06:04.281
Bottom line is

06:04.314 --> 06:06.784
you got to get out
of this mess with Iran.

06:06.817 --> 06:09.119
We have directives
from higher up.

06:09.153 --> 06:11.456
North won't listen to anyone.

06:11.489 --> 06:13.491
He's pushing forward
no matter what.

06:13.524 --> 06:15.793
Yeah, but on what time line?
That's what I'm saying.

06:15.826 --> 06:17.628
'Cause the Central American
countries, they are

06:17.662 --> 06:18.863
turning against us.

06:18.896 --> 06:20.665
The Sandinistas
are winning the PR war,

06:20.698 --> 06:22.032
and soon they're
gonna be winning

06:22.066 --> 06:23.668
-the actual war, too.
-I don't think it's as dire

06:23.701 --> 06:25.670
-as you're making it sound.
-Really? Every contact

06:25.703 --> 06:28.205
I have, every single one,
tells me that the flow of arms

06:28.238 --> 06:30.174
to Nicaragua has slowed.

06:32.009 --> 06:35.179
What is happening
in Los Angeles?

06:40.217 --> 06:43.654
I see what you're doing.

06:43.688 --> 06:44.855
What?

06:44.855 --> 06:47.992
You get yourself back
in my good graces,

06:48.025 --> 06:50.360
prove you're on your game,
sober and fit,

06:50.394 --> 06:53.864
and then-then, when something
goes wrong in L.A.,

06:53.898 --> 06:56.200
what choice
do I possibly have, right?

06:56.200 --> 06:58.035
You're saying there's
something wrong in L.A.

06:59.770 --> 07:01.205
You are fucking incredible.

07:01.238 --> 07:04.675
Who else knows this operation
as well as I do? Nobody.

07:04.709 --> 07:07.177
Right? So, if there
are problems,

07:07.211 --> 07:09.747
I should be able to identify
them pretty quickly.

07:09.780 --> 07:11.215
That's all I'm saying.

07:12.783 --> 07:15.520
After everything that happened,

07:15.553 --> 07:17.087
you'd really go back?

07:17.121 --> 07:19.690
Yes, absolutely.

07:19.724 --> 07:21.091
Look, it's been over a year.

07:21.125 --> 07:22.693
There have been
no follow-up articles,

07:22.727 --> 07:25.229
there have been no reporters
sniffing around, nothing.

07:27.064 --> 07:29.433
Couple of politicians
were asking questions.

07:29.466 --> 07:32.236
Yeah, a couple of PR-hungry,
rookie congressmen

07:32.236 --> 07:33.871
who were desperate to get
their name in the headlines,

07:33.904 --> 07:35.072
and you know what?

07:35.072 --> 07:37.074
Everybody thinks that
they're conspiracy nuts.

07:42.580 --> 07:44.414
Just...

07:45.750 --> 07:48.285
Let me go back.

07:48.318 --> 07:51.622
At least see if I can figure out
what's gone wrong.

08:04.935 --> 08:06.436
(camera shutter clicks)

08:08.939 --> 08:10.608
(camera shutter clicks)

08:18.949 --> 08:20.951
(metallic scraping)

08:22.953 --> 08:25.322
GRADY:
They got you working
on Sundays now, huh?

08:25.355 --> 08:27.592
Oh, yeah.
They say it's the only way

08:27.625 --> 08:29.493
you're gonna keep up
with the backlog, but listen,

08:29.526 --> 08:31.929
if you want
to call and complain,

08:31.962 --> 08:33.764
I won't stop you.

08:33.798 --> 08:36.266
(chuckles) Looks like I
should've been here yesterday.

08:36.300 --> 08:38.936
Must've been a hell of a party.

08:38.969 --> 08:40.938
Yeah.

08:40.971 --> 08:42.472
Morning.

09:11.001 --> 09:12.637
NEWSMAN: Population of
homeless living on the

09:12.670 --> 09:14.138
streets is believed
to be over 33,000,

09:14.171 --> 09:16.841
and shows no signs
of improvement.

09:16.841 --> 09:18.809
NEWSMAN 2: We will continue
to monitor any developments

09:18.843 --> 09:22.680
in this story and pass them on.
The L.A. City Council today...

09:31.722 --> 09:33.691
GRADY:
Jesus Christ.

09:33.691 --> 09:36.661
That is a serious airplane.

09:36.694 --> 09:39.229
Should've seen the Cessna
Dragonfly I flew over Laos.

09:39.263 --> 09:41.666
-Thing handled like a...
-FRANKLIN and GRADY: '57 Chevy.

09:41.699 --> 09:43.400
I told you that already? Well,

09:43.433 --> 09:44.669
you'll have to forgive me.

09:44.702 --> 09:46.704
Cocaine has not been good
for my memory.

09:48.205 --> 09:50.340
-What's up?
-Got a lot on my mind.

09:50.374 --> 09:52.342
Heavy is the head.

09:52.376 --> 09:55.045
Uh-huh.

09:55.079 --> 09:56.681
Can we talk the price break?

09:56.714 --> 09:58.215
Well, we can
if that makes you happy.

09:58.248 --> 10:01.385
It will if I get
the right answer.

10:05.255 --> 10:07.224
I can give you your price break

10:07.257 --> 10:09.593
on one condition.

10:13.731 --> 10:16.066
-You want my plane?
-Yup.

10:17.601 --> 10:19.603
I'm kidding, huh?

10:19.636 --> 10:21.906
-How about a joy ride?
-That's it?

10:21.939 --> 10:23.741
That's it.

10:25.409 --> 10:28.245
-Done.
-Now we're talking.

10:28.278 --> 10:29.714
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:
November-two-niner,

10:29.747 --> 10:31.315
you are cleared for takeoff
on Runway 2.

10:32.950 --> 10:35.753
-Landing gear. Lights.
-FRANKLIN: Up.

10:35.786 --> 10:37.587
-FRANKLIN: Off.
-GRADY: Flaps.

10:37.587 --> 10:39.423
-FRANKLIN: Up.
-GRADY: Climb power.

10:39.423 --> 10:41.892
Fucking plenty.
Get ready for this.

10:41.926 --> 10:44.094
(Grady yelling excitedly)

10:44.094 --> 10:46.931
(both laughing)

10:48.833 --> 10:51.468
GRADY:
Oh, this thing
fucking moves, huh?

10:51.501 --> 10:53.103
-FRANKLIN: Uh-huh.
-(Grady laughing)

10:53.137 --> 10:54.972
GRADY:
Oh, there it is.

10:55.005 --> 10:58.242
There's that smile.

10:58.275 --> 11:01.111
Hey, I worry about you,
you know?

11:01.111 --> 11:03.280
Gonna give yourself
an ulcer someday.

11:03.313 --> 11:06.116
-(laughs) I'm 24 years old.
-GRADY: Yeah,

11:06.150 --> 11:08.118
my point exactly.

11:08.152 --> 11:09.920
Look, the business
will work itself out.

11:09.954 --> 11:12.256
Yeah, it will,

11:12.289 --> 11:14.124
long as I make it.

11:16.460 --> 11:18.295
GRADY:
So how's everything else?

11:18.295 --> 11:20.765
How's the lady?

11:20.798 --> 11:23.167
She's good, real good.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.468
Getting serious.

11:24.501 --> 11:26.971
Think she's a keeper?

11:26.971 --> 11:28.839
-I do.
-That's good.

11:28.873 --> 11:32.142
I've had four good women
in my life,

11:32.142 --> 11:33.477
all ex-wives,

11:33.510 --> 11:35.679
all keepers,

11:35.712 --> 11:37.447
until they weren't.

11:37.481 --> 11:40.484
Four? Damn. I didn't know that.

11:40.517 --> 11:42.186
Any kids?

11:42.219 --> 11:43.520
Yeah, a few.

11:43.553 --> 11:46.456
Love my kids. Hate their moms,

11:46.490 --> 11:48.826
-but I love my kids.
-(laughs)

11:48.859 --> 11:51.128
-(laughs)
-FRANKLIN: Man...

11:51.161 --> 11:52.863
You ever thought about
having some little Franklins

11:52.897 --> 11:54.464
running around someday?

11:54.498 --> 11:57.667
Yeah... maybe.

11:57.701 --> 12:00.470
GRADY:
Well, they'd be lucky
to have you.

12:00.504 --> 12:03.507
Like they'd won
the fucking lottery.

12:21.926 --> 12:24.361
So, how is it?

12:24.361 --> 12:26.030
It's not good.

12:27.397 --> 12:29.433
Grady is a mess.

12:30.567 --> 12:33.037
There's a massive disparity
between the amount of product

12:33.070 --> 12:35.539
being moved and the money
that's making it to Nicaragua.

12:35.572 --> 12:38.175
Now, it's hard to say exactly
how much he's skimmed,

12:38.208 --> 12:40.244
but... my guess would be

12:40.277 --> 12:42.712
mid-seven figures.

12:42.712 --> 12:44.381
And not only that,

12:44.414 --> 12:47.051
he's in business with the asset.

12:47.051 --> 12:49.753
Legitimate real estate deals
using shell companies.

12:49.786 --> 12:51.521
And, as if that wasn't enough,

12:51.555 --> 12:54.424
he's also in a relationship
with one of his people,

12:54.458 --> 12:56.226
a physical one.

12:56.260 --> 12:58.728
-Grady's gone native.
-(sighs)

12:58.728 --> 13:00.931
I think we both know
how that story ends,

13:00.965 --> 13:04.568
unless you want to do something
about it right now.

13:05.970 --> 13:09.406
You sure you can work
with the asset?

13:09.406 --> 13:11.741
Considering the history there?

13:11.775 --> 13:13.743
What, you mean that
I made him rich?

13:13.777 --> 13:15.612
Or got him out of jail?

13:15.645 --> 13:17.747
Saved his ass
with that reporter.

13:17.781 --> 13:20.918
Yes, I think we'll be fine.

13:20.918 --> 13:22.286
See, I was thinking more about

13:22.319 --> 13:24.121
what you did
to his father in Cuba.

13:26.323 --> 13:28.158
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:32.963 --> 13:34.464
Get Grady in line,

13:34.498 --> 13:36.300
but do it quietly.

13:42.940 --> 13:45.575
-What the fuck?
-Don't worry.

13:45.609 --> 13:47.144
(laughs) I'll get it
all put away.

13:47.177 --> 13:50.447
-Ain't nobody worried.
-(laughs)

13:50.480 --> 13:51.916
How was your flight?

13:51.949 --> 13:54.484
It was good. Took Grady up.

13:57.321 --> 13:58.488
What?

13:58.522 --> 14:00.457
You want to sage me
or something?

14:00.457 --> 14:02.592
Mm, I'm thinking about it, yeah.

14:02.626 --> 14:04.494
(laughs) What's this?

14:04.528 --> 14:08.332
This is my attempt
to align our chaos into...

14:08.365 --> 14:11.435
-organized chaos?
-(grunts)

14:11.468 --> 14:14.171
Oh, my God, I don't know how you
sit on the floor like that.

14:14.204 --> 14:17.174
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, shit.

14:17.207 --> 14:20.310
(grunts) Ah.

14:20.344 --> 14:23.480
-That's the day the baby comes.
-If she sticks to the plan.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.315
Or he.

14:25.315 --> 14:27.351
The universe
wouldn't do me like that.

14:27.384 --> 14:29.453
(both laugh)

14:29.486 --> 14:31.621
Man...

14:31.655 --> 14:33.991
So, wait a minute, ah, yeah.

14:33.991 --> 14:35.792
-Look at you.
-(chuckles)

14:35.825 --> 14:38.028
Color coded it using
them chakras and shit.

14:38.062 --> 14:39.029
VERONIQUE:
Maybe.

14:39.063 --> 14:41.665
(sighs)

14:41.698 --> 14:43.533
That's the deadline
for signing off on trusts

14:43.567 --> 14:46.136
for me and the baby.

14:46.170 --> 14:48.005
And that over there,
that's the deadline

14:48.038 --> 14:51.008
for the 501(c)(3)
nonprofit corp.

14:51.041 --> 14:54.044
And do you remember
what that color is?

14:54.078 --> 14:57.481
-Something about sex?
-Mm.

14:57.514 --> 14:58.682
Sure, yeah.

14:58.682 --> 15:01.051
The sacral chakra.

15:01.085 --> 15:03.853
-Ah.
-Mm. OB-GYN visits.

15:03.853 --> 15:06.690
You see, I was, I was close.
I was real close.

15:06.690 --> 15:08.025
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

15:09.193 --> 15:12.562
And that's the deadline
to submit for the building.

15:12.596 --> 15:14.564
The colors represent
imagination,

15:14.598 --> 15:17.167
freedom, trust.

15:17.201 --> 15:20.204
Should be green. All the
fucking money we about to make.

15:20.237 --> 15:22.839
(laughs) What we about

15:22.872 --> 15:26.176
to get into with
this building is a big deal,

15:26.210 --> 15:27.677
and you trusted my instincts
to go with it,

15:27.711 --> 15:29.913
and it's gonna provide
for generations to come.

15:29.946 --> 15:31.748
I can feel it.

15:31.781 --> 15:35.585
Which is why you should have
a personal equity stake.

15:35.619 --> 15:37.587
You gonna own a piece, too.

15:39.056 --> 15:40.890
They just canceled
Diff'rent Strokes.

15:40.890 --> 15:43.727
I'm really sensitive
right now, huh.

15:43.760 --> 15:45.095
Are you for real?

15:45.129 --> 15:47.197
Would I lie to a pregnant woman?

15:47.231 --> 15:50.600
-I don't know. (laughs)
-Huh? Would I? Would I?

15:50.634 --> 15:53.070
(kisses) Yeah, for real.

15:53.103 --> 15:54.704
(sighs)

15:54.738 --> 15:57.307
Paperwork's right there
in my briefcase.

15:59.076 --> 16:01.445
Thank you, Franklin.

16:02.912 --> 16:04.581
Don't thank me.

16:06.083 --> 16:08.585
-Thank the universe.
-(both laughing)

16:10.154 --> 16:11.888
I'm serious.

16:11.921 --> 16:14.558
It's nice when someone
sees your value,

16:14.591 --> 16:16.060
you know?

16:16.093 --> 16:17.594
Mm.

16:19.263 --> 16:20.430
Hey.

16:22.166 --> 16:25.302
I'm gonna give you
the fucking world.

16:25.335 --> 16:27.104
(whispers):
You promise?

16:37.114 --> 16:38.448
FRANKLIN:
The U.S. Treasury has

16:38.482 --> 16:39.649
started to investigate
money laundering

16:39.683 --> 16:40.917
in Central America.

16:40.950 --> 16:42.752
Panama banks
are solid for now.

16:42.786 --> 16:44.454
There's a better way
to invest your money.

16:44.488 --> 16:46.756
VERONIQUE:
The L.A. Community

16:46.790 --> 16:48.125
Redevelopment Agency is working

16:48.158 --> 16:49.593
to revitalize
this downtown area.

16:49.626 --> 16:51.595
We're bidding on this property,

16:51.628 --> 16:53.097
and we're pretty sure
we can get it.

16:53.130 --> 16:56.433
Mm-hmm. So, the plan is,
using our shell companies,

16:56.466 --> 16:58.435
to repatriate your money
from Panama.

16:58.468 --> 16:59.969
Repatriate? I don't know
what the fuck that mean.

17:00.003 --> 17:02.139
What you trying to do
with our money?

17:02.172 --> 17:04.474
Move it from Panama
into this country

17:04.508 --> 17:06.276
and invest it in this project.

17:06.310 --> 17:07.444
Legitimately, though.

17:07.477 --> 17:08.945
How much?

17:08.978 --> 17:10.814
VERONIQUE:
In order for us
to be competitive

17:10.814 --> 17:13.283
and retain majority ownership,

17:13.317 --> 17:15.452
our ideal buy-in from you two
is $10 million.

17:15.485 --> 17:18.455
Shit, that's almost
all the money we got.

17:18.488 --> 17:20.690
FRANKLIN:
Thing is, the more we put up
for private equity,

17:20.724 --> 17:23.360
the more we own,

17:23.393 --> 17:27.331
and the less the banks
are involved, huh.

17:27.364 --> 17:29.633
(sighs) I don't know.

17:29.666 --> 17:31.635
-Legit ownership?
-All legit.

17:31.668 --> 17:33.670
And once the building's
finished,

17:33.703 --> 17:35.805
we'll be getting
commercial rent,

17:35.839 --> 17:38.308
and our stakes will appreciate
as the economy comes back.

17:38.342 --> 17:40.644
How long is it gonna take
to get our money back?

17:40.677 --> 17:42.346
Three years,

17:42.379 --> 17:43.847
-maybe less.
-JEROME: Three years?

17:43.880 --> 17:45.315
FRANKLIN:
Look, this is

17:45.349 --> 17:48.152
a long-term investment,
all right?

17:48.185 --> 17:50.854
Returns in the area
of eight percent annually.

17:50.854 --> 17:54.191
Tax sheltered,
and best of all, clean.

17:54.224 --> 17:57.327
It's passive fucking income,
that's what it is.

17:57.361 --> 17:59.196
How you want to be.

17:59.229 --> 18:00.830
And if we ever
do decide to sell,

18:00.864 --> 18:02.666
your initial investment
can double,

18:02.699 --> 18:04.668
triple, sky's the limit.

18:04.701 --> 18:06.035
It's all in there,

18:06.035 --> 18:07.504
along with
the comparative analysis

18:07.537 --> 18:10.374
of other commercial properties
in the area.

18:10.374 --> 18:11.841
LOUIE:
Mm-hmm.

18:11.875 --> 18:13.677
We need to talk about it.

18:13.710 --> 18:14.911
FRANKLIN:
Yeah, yeah, of course.

18:14.944 --> 18:16.546
Take a look at the projections.

18:16.546 --> 18:18.182
-Let us know.
-VERONIQUE: I'm gonna head back

18:18.215 --> 18:19.916
-to the office. Mm.
-All right.

18:25.389 --> 18:27.023
-I'll see you later.
-Mm-hmm.

18:27.056 --> 18:28.892
(Jerome chuckles)

18:31.728 --> 18:34.063
Anything new
about Rob and his friend?

18:36.966 --> 18:40.370
Yeah, it's all taken care of.
Rob's out.

18:40.404 --> 18:43.039
His friend who did
the shooting, too.

18:43.072 --> 18:44.774
By "out," you mean...

18:44.808 --> 18:46.276
Out.

18:46.310 --> 18:49.246
Rob was on the pipe.

18:49.279 --> 18:50.747
Couldn't be trusted anymore.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.252
Damn, nephew. Wow.

19:00.490 --> 19:01.925
(phone rings)

19:01.958 --> 19:03.927
WANDA:
Thank you, baby.

19:03.927 --> 19:07.597
Now, you know, you always
got to ask for me, Karen,

19:07.597 --> 19:10.400
and then we'll always have fun.

19:10.434 --> 19:12.769
(chuckles) Mm.

19:12.802 --> 19:15.004
I can't wait.

19:17.140 --> 19:19.142
I'm getting wet already.

19:25.114 --> 19:26.450
WOMAN:
Oh, yeah.

19:26.483 --> 19:29.419
JOHNNY B:
I'm busy.

19:29.453 --> 19:31.588
This shit is short.

19:31.621 --> 19:32.622
(sighs)

19:35.292 --> 19:37.461
The FCC's getting
more complaints

19:37.494 --> 19:39.263
about bill cramming,
so I'm taking

19:39.296 --> 19:42.098
-a bigger cut for fines.
-That ain't my problem.

19:42.131 --> 19:43.300
Fines can put me
out of business.

19:43.333 --> 19:45.101
No business, no job.
Your problem.

19:45.134 --> 19:46.670
(clicks tongue)

19:46.703 --> 19:48.171
You know how much
the telephone company takes

19:48.204 --> 19:50.507
after each call? 40%.

19:50.540 --> 19:52.942
And then there's rent and upkeep

19:52.976 --> 19:55.312
and equipment. I'm barely
staying above water here.

19:55.345 --> 19:56.780
I could give a fuck.

19:56.813 --> 19:58.014
So, this is the new deal.

19:58.047 --> 20:00.216
You don't like it?
Door's right there.

20:01.485 --> 20:03.620
(snorting)

20:03.653 --> 20:05.955
Mmm. (sniffs)

20:05.989 --> 20:08.492
Or...

20:08.525 --> 20:11.795
if you want to party with me,
we could work something out.

20:11.828 --> 20:13.830
Yeah?

20:16.333 --> 20:18.001
Yeah.

20:23.039 --> 20:24.374
That's all I got to do?

20:24.408 --> 20:27.010
That's all, baby.

20:28.678 --> 20:31.180
-Fucking bitch!
-Fuck you! And fuck this job.

20:31.180 --> 20:33.182
JOHNNY B:
You think you'll get
another gig like this?

20:33.216 --> 20:36.052
Sit on your ass all day
and bullshit on the phone?!

20:37.387 --> 20:40.857
Vamos, apúrenle
que vamos bien tarde.

20:40.857 --> 20:43.192
-It's your fault.
-No, it's not. Shut up.

20:43.192 --> 20:44.861
-Yes, it is.
-W-Why would you even say that?

20:44.894 --> 20:46.396
Échenme la culpa.

20:46.430 --> 20:48.565
Tell your teacher
it was my fault, okay?

20:48.598 --> 20:52.001
I was... I was the whole morning
in the, in the, in the toilet.

20:52.035 --> 20:53.370
Cagando.

20:53.403 --> 20:54.904
-Ew!
-That's gross.

20:54.938 --> 20:57.040
-Ándenle, ándenle.
-Yuck.

20:57.073 --> 20:58.408
And learn something.

20:58.442 --> 21:00.544
No quiero burros.

21:01.545 --> 21:04.381
GIRL: I know. I don't want
to be late. Come on.

21:05.281 --> 21:09.018
-(school bell rings)
-Your kids look happy.

21:09.052 --> 21:11.521
Pos hay la llevan,
gracias a Dios.

21:11.555 --> 21:14.558
Took a long time.

21:14.591 --> 21:16.526
And Xiamara?

21:16.560 --> 21:17.727
Xiamara...

21:17.761 --> 21:20.897
Pos resulta que...
She likes this life.

21:20.930 --> 21:22.899
Maybe too much.

21:22.932 --> 21:26.202
Well, I wondered if maybe
I wouldn't find you with...

21:26.235 --> 21:29.072
Lucia. Thought about it.

21:29.105 --> 21:32.075
Lanzarme a Miami. Show up.

21:32.075 --> 21:34.411
But then I realized

21:34.411 --> 21:37.714
my family's here, you know?

21:37.747 --> 21:39.483
I think it's a good choice.

21:40.817 --> 21:42.586
So...

21:44.153 --> 21:46.089
What you doing here?

21:48.091 --> 21:50.259
Grady's sloppy.

21:50.293 --> 21:52.095
He's compromised.

21:52.128 --> 21:54.297
He's a danger to himself,
to the mission,

21:54.330 --> 21:56.265
to everyone.

21:56.265 --> 21:59.969
So, they're bringing you back?

22:04.273 --> 22:05.308
Entonces el Grady's out?

22:05.341 --> 22:07.143
Shortly, yeah.

22:07.176 --> 22:09.312
Mm.

22:11.448 --> 22:14.117
He loves it here.

22:14.150 --> 22:16.352
His job.
La feria más.

22:17.987 --> 22:21.758
This-this guy is not gonna like
being told to leave.

22:21.791 --> 22:23.527
It's not his choice.

22:27.330 --> 22:29.332
I'm here

22:29.365 --> 22:31.701
'cause I need to know
if I can still count on you.

22:36.372 --> 22:38.975
Pues ya sabes.
Just want to take care

22:38.975 --> 22:40.977
-of my family.
-Of course.

22:40.977 --> 22:42.779
And I'll look out for you,
same as before.

22:42.812 --> 22:44.548
Okay.

22:47.984 --> 22:50.319
Grady's not a bad guy, you know?

22:50.319 --> 22:52.822
And he's more fun than you.

22:52.822 --> 22:54.991
I'm fun.

22:54.991 --> 22:56.526
(laughs)

22:57.827 --> 23:01.164
You are mi carnal,
but fun, you are not.

23:01.164 --> 23:05.034
I got eight AKs, five MAC-10s,

23:05.068 --> 23:06.803
and my new favorite,

23:06.836 --> 23:09.172
a Mini Uzi.

23:10.339 --> 23:12.375
Invented by a friend of mine,

23:12.408 --> 23:15.812
Major Uziel Gal.
Got 15 of these.

23:15.845 --> 23:18.548
-Feels like a toy.
-A toy that does 950 rounds

23:18.582 --> 23:20.850
per minute.

23:20.884 --> 23:22.486
And it never jams.

23:22.519 --> 23:23.987
LOUIE:
Mm.

23:24.020 --> 23:26.055
You like?

23:26.089 --> 23:27.824
We do.

23:27.857 --> 23:30.059
Look at you two,

23:30.093 --> 23:32.529
regular Bonnie and Clyde.
Do you know that movie?

23:32.562 --> 23:34.831
Know shit ain't end up
too good for them.

23:34.864 --> 23:36.866
No, no, no, ignore that part.

23:36.866 --> 23:38.702
I meant, just, you know,

23:38.735 --> 23:41.505
having a partner in crime.

23:41.538 --> 23:44.373
I'm jealous,
if you really want to know.

23:44.407 --> 23:45.875
Yeah.

23:45.875 --> 23:47.410
You got each other,

23:47.443 --> 23:50.079
you got money, you got the city.

23:50.113 --> 23:52.048
Hope it's making you happy.

23:52.048 --> 23:54.350
Next time you come, stay longer.

23:54.383 --> 23:57.053
Hmm? We'll talk more.

24:05.228 --> 24:06.763
(sighs) That was weird.

24:06.796 --> 24:09.566
You think he got something
going on with him?

24:09.566 --> 24:11.735
You start thinking what
might be going on with Avi,

24:11.735 --> 24:13.036
you end up in a straitjacket.

24:13.069 --> 24:14.771
(scoffs)

24:14.804 --> 24:16.205
What?

24:16.239 --> 24:18.441
I mean, is he right, though?

24:20.076 --> 24:21.545
You happy?

24:21.578 --> 24:23.780
Shit.

24:23.813 --> 24:26.049
I'm rich, I'm alive,

24:26.082 --> 24:28.718
got you sitting over there
in that skirt,

24:28.752 --> 24:30.887
and the Raiders in L.A. (laughs)

24:30.920 --> 24:32.589
I don't see how
I could be much better.

24:33.990 --> 24:35.725
Well...

24:35.759 --> 24:37.761
maybe I ain't say it enough,

24:37.794 --> 24:40.429
how much I appreciate you.

24:42.165 --> 24:44.568
Was a time you didn't want
to be in this game at all,

24:44.601 --> 24:46.269
and now you all the way in,

24:46.269 --> 24:48.672
and I know that
that's because of me.

24:50.306 --> 24:52.909
And that's everything.

24:52.942 --> 24:55.478
(banging on truck)

24:55.511 --> 24:58.782
You a king among men.

25:00.950 --> 25:02.952
I hope you know that.

25:05.989 --> 25:08.291
OPERATOR:
Ocho, cuatro, dos, seis.

25:08.324 --> 25:11.460
Yeah, Havana.

25:11.460 --> 25:13.262
OPERATOR:
Sí, sí. Del La Province Habana.

25:13.296 --> 25:15.599
Look, could you
connect me, please?

25:15.632 --> 25:17.266
I'm having trouble
calling direct.

25:17.300 --> 25:19.603
-Aquí tiene, señor.
-(line beeping)

25:19.636 --> 25:21.104
CISSY:
Son?

25:21.137 --> 25:23.306
Mama?

25:23.306 --> 25:24.941
Mom, you there? Can you hear me?

25:24.974 --> 25:26.275
Franklin?

25:26.309 --> 25:28.945
It's so good to hear from you.

25:28.978 --> 25:30.780
Sweetheart, how are you?

25:30.814 --> 25:33.783
Uh, Mama, these connections
are getting worse.

25:33.817 --> 25:35.318
I got to find a better one.

25:35.351 --> 25:36.853
(staticky):
Franklin...

25:36.886 --> 25:39.656
I got some important news
about Veronique.

25:41.057 --> 25:43.326
I know they say
it's too early to tell people,

25:43.359 --> 25:45.394
but you know
I had to tell you, though.

25:47.396 --> 25:49.165
She's pregnant.

25:50.734 --> 25:52.035
What did you say?

25:52.068 --> 25:54.037
Mom, we gonna have a baby.

25:54.070 --> 25:55.672
A baby?

25:57.040 --> 25:59.375
Can't believe it. (chuckles)

25:59.408 --> 26:01.711
How exciting!

26:01.745 --> 26:03.847
Sure wish you was here.

26:06.850 --> 26:08.652
Mama, can you hear me?

26:08.685 --> 26:10.687
(line beeping)

26:16.359 --> 26:17.861
(sighs)

26:23.767 --> 26:25.869
(indistinct chatter,
laughter)

26:32.709 --> 26:35.879
Chaperoning field trips now?

26:35.879 --> 26:38.247
Just trying to open up
their worlds a little bit.

26:38.281 --> 26:39.783
(laughs)

26:41.384 --> 26:43.052
Do it again in a few weeks?

26:43.086 --> 26:44.620
You got it.

26:48.557 --> 26:50.559
Where'd you take them?

26:50.559 --> 26:52.561
Uh, Santa Monica
for the last few times,

26:52.561 --> 26:54.430
but got hassled by the cops,

26:54.463 --> 26:56.099
so been going down
to El Segundo.

26:56.132 --> 26:57.934
Hmm.

26:57.967 --> 27:01.270
Remember when you, me and Kev
went to the beach that time?

27:01.304 --> 27:02.872
(chuckles)

27:02.906 --> 27:05.775
First time
I'd ever seen the ocean.

27:05.809 --> 27:07.744
Shit's scary as fuck.

27:10.079 --> 27:11.781
Come on.

27:15.584 --> 27:18.454
LEON:
You ever look
at that book I gave you?

27:18.487 --> 27:20.890
Mm. Meaning to.

27:20.924 --> 27:23.092
Haven't got around to it yet.

27:24.593 --> 27:26.395
I wanted to talk to you
about this

27:26.429 --> 27:28.231
development opportunity
downtown.

27:28.264 --> 27:30.566
Appreciate it, but...

27:30.599 --> 27:33.636
gonna have to pass on that one.

27:33.669 --> 27:35.739
Look, you know
I don't care about

27:35.772 --> 27:37.240
what you do with your money.

27:37.273 --> 27:39.408
Just want to make sure
you got a plan.

27:39.442 --> 27:41.244
Look, already got more
than I ever thought I would have

27:41.277 --> 27:42.946
-or could need.
-Yeah. (scoffs)

27:42.946 --> 27:45.148
You know, can't be
doing you any good.

27:45.181 --> 27:47.951
You know, you burying it or...

27:47.951 --> 27:49.652
stashing it in shoeboxes

27:49.685 --> 27:51.254
or wherever you keeping it.

27:51.287 --> 27:53.122
Well, I'd rather that than
using it to build some building

27:53.156 --> 27:56.325
that white folks will just want
to keep Black folks out of.

27:56.359 --> 27:59.495
All right. All right.

28:00.463 --> 28:02.799
Jerome told me about Rob.

28:04.300 --> 28:05.634
Yeah.

28:06.970 --> 28:08.437
(sighs)

28:08.471 --> 28:10.439
He was on the pipe.

28:10.473 --> 28:12.608
-Maybe he could've cleaned up.
-You didn't see him.

28:12.641 --> 28:15.444
Could've folded any time.

28:15.478 --> 28:16.980
Said some shit
he shouldn't have.

28:18.547 --> 28:19.783
Couldn't have been easy.

28:19.816 --> 28:22.952
It wasn't,

28:22.986 --> 28:24.821
but it had to be done.

28:31.660 --> 28:34.030
(sighs)

28:34.063 --> 28:35.464
Veronique's pregnant.

28:35.498 --> 28:37.967
-Oh, shit, for real?
-(chuckles) Uh-huh.

28:38.001 --> 28:40.669
It's only been about six weeks.

28:40.669 --> 28:43.973
I ain't told nobody else.

28:44.007 --> 28:45.809
But you see, that's why, man.

28:45.842 --> 28:47.510
That's why.

28:49.045 --> 28:51.580
Why I got to keep
this motherfucker tight.

28:59.889 --> 29:01.991
I see you thinking it,
might as well say it.

29:02.025 --> 29:04.193
(clears throat)

29:04.193 --> 29:06.029
Nothing.

29:06.029 --> 29:08.031
I'm happy for you.

29:08.031 --> 29:10.867
About to be a daddy. (laughs)

29:10.867 --> 29:13.502
-(chuckles)
-Shit is crazy.

29:13.536 --> 29:16.339
About to be a daddy.

29:16.372 --> 29:18.374
(crickets chirping)

29:27.216 --> 29:30.219
I admire your taste in wine.

29:34.390 --> 29:36.259
DWP.

29:36.292 --> 29:39.028
But without the wig.
I'd offer you a line

29:39.062 --> 29:41.030
or a drink,
but I'm guessing you'd say no.

29:41.064 --> 29:43.532
-Yeah, I'm working.
-Right.

29:43.566 --> 29:45.068
Right.

29:46.735 --> 29:48.905
So, what, did you
come here to warn me?

29:48.905 --> 29:50.406
You gonna rap my knuckles?

29:50.439 --> 29:53.709
What'd you expect?

29:53.742 --> 29:56.579
This house, those cars...

29:59.983 --> 30:02.751
That's before we even get
to the millions of dollars

30:02.751 --> 30:05.421
that are flowing
directly into your pocket

30:05.421 --> 30:07.723
-and not to the cause.
-Well, there's a lot
of looking the other direction.

30:07.756 --> 30:09.658
I just figured I was included.

30:11.127 --> 30:12.595
You're not.

30:14.430 --> 30:15.598
Fine.

30:15.598 --> 30:17.967
I got the message.

30:18.001 --> 30:19.969
Now, you can go tell
your masters

30:20.003 --> 30:22.305
that you did your job,
all right?

30:22.338 --> 30:24.440
(chair scraping)

30:27.810 --> 30:29.946
It's too late.

30:29.979 --> 30:31.847
Your contract's canceled.
It's over.

30:33.182 --> 30:34.450
No.

30:36.285 --> 30:37.921
No, I don't...

30:37.954 --> 30:39.855
I don't think that it is.

30:50.033 --> 30:52.969
Who has a relationship
with the Colombians?

30:52.969 --> 30:55.138
Who can get 500 keys
across the border

30:55.138 --> 30:56.472
and knows how to move it?

30:56.472 --> 30:58.141
Yeah, you know, if it was
anybody else sitting here,

30:58.174 --> 31:00.009
those might be problems.

31:01.144 --> 31:03.980
Wait, you're the guy?

31:04.013 --> 31:06.482
(laughs):
Oh, my God.

31:06.482 --> 31:08.517
You're the, you're the guy.

31:08.551 --> 31:10.486
You're the guy that...

31:10.486 --> 31:12.388
You're the guy that almost
went down with the ship.

31:14.490 --> 31:15.992
Wow.

31:15.992 --> 31:18.127
Well, how'd they get you
to come back?

31:18.161 --> 31:20.829
Was it the carrot
or was it the stick?

31:22.498 --> 31:25.834
You can keep the cars,
whatever money you've managed

31:25.868 --> 31:27.303
to squirrel away.

31:27.336 --> 31:29.472
Wait, maybe they
didn't come back to you.

31:29.505 --> 31:31.307
Maybe you volunteered.

31:31.340 --> 31:32.641
You're one of the last
true believers

31:32.675 --> 31:33.809
who's not in on the joke yet.

31:33.842 --> 31:36.479
You know,
all the "God and country" guys

31:36.512 --> 31:38.047
that I come across,
they're-they're looking

31:38.081 --> 31:40.549
for something else
to fill, you know?

31:40.583 --> 31:42.385
They want to be important.

31:42.418 --> 31:44.687
They want to feel
like they matter.

31:44.720 --> 31:47.856
They want to feel like
they're not a fucking joke.

31:47.856 --> 31:49.692
I'll be back here tomorrow,

31:49.725 --> 31:52.028
-and I expect you to be gone.
-GRADY: Well, hold on.
Let me guess.

31:52.028 --> 31:55.031
Your wife left you. She's off
fucking some other guy.

31:55.031 --> 31:56.865
Your kids,
they don't want to talk to you

31:56.865 --> 31:58.401
'cause you're a fucking idiot.

31:58.434 --> 32:00.036
And-and your parents,
I'm guessing that

32:00.036 --> 32:02.838
they probably kicked you around
so much as a little pup,

32:02.871 --> 32:04.407
that you started to believe

32:04.440 --> 32:06.742
that you didn't matter,
that you weren't worth a shit.

32:06.775 --> 32:09.045
Am I close?

32:12.081 --> 32:14.450
(sighs)

32:19.222 --> 32:22.391
You think I didn't
see this coming? (chuckles)

32:22.425 --> 32:24.560
Yeah, you go back,
and you tell them

32:24.560 --> 32:27.930
that I know an awful lot
that they don't want coming out.

32:27.963 --> 32:30.266
You tell them that
I am this operation,

32:30.299 --> 32:32.201
and that they better
think twice next time

32:32.235 --> 32:33.869
before they come to this house.

32:33.902 --> 32:35.404
(door closes)

32:41.144 --> 32:42.545
Want me to send
some folks down there,

32:42.578 --> 32:43.746
fuck his whole day up?

32:43.779 --> 32:46.582
Nah. It was a stupid-ass
job anyways.

32:46.615 --> 32:48.551
You wouldn't believe
how disgusting

32:48.584 --> 32:50.286
some of these niggas are.

32:51.954 --> 32:55.258
But it took me months of looking
even to find that one.

32:55.258 --> 32:57.426
Thought of going back out there,

32:57.460 --> 33:00.496
trying to explain the whole
two-year gap in my life...

33:03.099 --> 33:04.733
The way people look at you

33:04.767 --> 33:06.635
when they realize
you was on that rock.

33:06.669 --> 33:09.572
So, don't tell them.
Make some shit up.

33:09.605 --> 33:12.808
Mm-mm. That's part
of the recovery,

33:12.841 --> 33:15.578
being honest with yourself
and the world.

33:15.611 --> 33:18.281
(scoffs) You know,

33:18.314 --> 33:21.984
I thought getting sober
was gonna be the hard part,

33:22.017 --> 33:25.121
but staying clean, sh...

33:25.121 --> 33:27.590
It's almost worse.

33:27.623 --> 33:29.425
Especially when you
got to keep paying for shit

33:29.458 --> 33:32.595
you did while you was high.

33:32.628 --> 33:34.463
I got to do something, Lee.

33:36.965 --> 33:40.269
I might need you to put me on.

33:40.303 --> 33:43.606
You was here, remember?
Walked away for a reason.

33:43.639 --> 33:45.441
I know, but that was
almost a year ago.

33:45.474 --> 33:46.942
Temptation's still the same.

33:46.975 --> 33:48.977
You really want to be
around that shit all day?

33:54.317 --> 33:56.319
Don't think I got a choice.

33:56.319 --> 33:59.488
You do.
And I'm gonna make it easy.

33:59.522 --> 34:01.357
Ain't nothing here for you.

34:01.390 --> 34:03.992
Gonna have to figure
something else out.

34:16.372 --> 34:18.407
*

34:30.519 --> 34:33.322
(grunting)

34:33.356 --> 34:35.358
(coughing, gasping)

34:47.770 --> 34:50.206
Should've taken the out.

34:53.942 --> 34:56.044
(gurgling)

34:56.078 --> 34:57.913
(retching)

34:57.946 --> 35:00.216
(whispering):
I want you to understand,

35:00.216 --> 35:03.051
this is not because
you insulted me.

35:04.453 --> 35:05.888
(labored breathing)

35:05.921 --> 35:08.056
It's because
you're bad at your job.

35:09.458 --> 35:11.927
Your waste cost countless lives.

35:11.960 --> 35:13.562
(coughs)

35:24.240 --> 35:25.408
(doorbell rings)

35:28.644 --> 35:30.413
You forget your key again?

35:39.988 --> 35:43.091
-Hey.
-Hey.

35:43.125 --> 35:45.894
-Can I come in or...
-Yeah.

35:45.928 --> 35:47.796
Come on, man. (chuckles)

35:47.830 --> 35:50.266
Yeah, welcome.
(clears throat)

36:05.113 --> 36:07.149
It's a nice place.

36:17.293 --> 36:19.495
It's safe.

36:19.528 --> 36:22.265
It's quiet. Secluded.

36:22.298 --> 36:24.467
Secure.

36:26.469 --> 36:28.304
Guess it's everything
I'd expect from you, right?

36:28.337 --> 36:30.105
When'd you get back in town?

36:30.138 --> 36:32.808
TEDDY:
Uh, a few weeks ago.
You know, what's crazy is

36:32.841 --> 36:35.811
I never, in my life, thought
that I would miss Los Angeles...

36:38.146 --> 36:41.784
But I don't know, man,
somehow this place

36:41.817 --> 36:44.687
has a way of growing on you.

36:44.720 --> 36:47.856
Oh, shit, I hear
you're coming up.

36:47.890 --> 36:49.525
Got your pilot's license.

36:49.558 --> 36:52.461
-(chuckles) Yeah.
-Holy shit.

36:52.495 --> 36:54.997
And a lady, that right?

36:56.499 --> 36:58.734
Yo, you want a cigar
or something?

37:02.838 --> 37:04.373
Sure.

37:05.374 --> 37:08.977
Thing's been moving smooth, man.

37:09.011 --> 37:11.314
Got to call Grady.
He's doing a great job.

37:11.347 --> 37:13.549
I know you like Grady.

37:13.582 --> 37:15.551
I know that he is...

37:15.584 --> 37:18.020
easy to be around.

37:20.188 --> 37:21.657
That's his job.

37:21.690 --> 37:23.826
Make you like him,
make you trust him,

37:23.859 --> 37:25.361
make you think that
he's looking out for you.

37:25.394 --> 37:26.662
Saying he's not?

37:26.695 --> 37:29.698
Saying he makes
some really poor choices.

37:29.732 --> 37:32.067
Now, partying,

37:32.100 --> 37:35.538
that's something
I could forgive, but...

37:35.571 --> 37:38.707
he goes and he gets
himself into...

37:38.707 --> 37:39.908
let's call it

37:39.942 --> 37:42.210
a romantic relationship,
with one of your crew,

37:42.210 --> 37:43.546
and that's before we even get

37:43.546 --> 37:46.715
to the two of you

37:46.715 --> 37:49.518
in real estate together,
which...

37:49.552 --> 37:51.053
(whistles)

37:52.621 --> 37:54.690
Look, I get it.

37:54.723 --> 37:56.091
I know that, at the time,

37:56.124 --> 37:58.060
it probably seemed
like a really good idea.

37:58.093 --> 37:59.395
If you're entwined
in legitimate business,

37:59.428 --> 38:00.529
he's more likely to protect you,

38:00.563 --> 38:02.197
look after you, all that.

38:02.230 --> 38:04.533
Why do you keep talking about
him in the past tense, Reed?

38:04.567 --> 38:06.869
What I cannot
wrap my head around here

38:06.902 --> 38:09.538
is how you could possibly think
that it is a good idea

38:09.572 --> 38:11.407
to get that close
to your contact.

38:11.407 --> 38:12.908
Figured if somebody
had a problem with it,

38:12.908 --> 38:14.109
they would've said something.

38:14.142 --> 38:16.612
Here I am, saying it.

38:19.482 --> 38:22.885
Grady was not your friend.

38:22.918 --> 38:24.920
It's a matter of time
before he got everybody

38:24.953 --> 38:26.789
in a lot of trouble.
Good news is

38:26.822 --> 38:30.393
it's been taken care of before
things can get too out of hand.

38:30.426 --> 38:32.561
We can get back to doing things
the way they should be done.

38:32.595 --> 38:34.497
Starting when?

38:36.599 --> 38:37.766
Right now.

38:40.268 --> 38:43.271
We got shit done before.

38:43.271 --> 38:45.073
No reason why we can't
get shit done now.

38:45.107 --> 38:47.109
That's really great to hear.

38:49.111 --> 38:51.780
'Cause I don't think
I have to explain to you...

38:53.449 --> 38:55.951
...that the stakes
have never been higher,

38:55.984 --> 38:58.421
so there can be no more
mistakes, no more foul-ups,

38:58.454 --> 39:00.623
and no more loose ends.
Is that okay?

39:00.656 --> 39:01.957
Yeah, okay.

39:03.792 --> 39:04.993
Okay.

39:08.997 --> 39:11.299
I'll, uh, be in touch about

39:11.299 --> 39:12.835
the next drop.

39:12.868 --> 39:16.004
In the meantime, uh,
this house that

39:16.038 --> 39:18.173
you helped him get
through your trust,

39:18.206 --> 39:20.976
go ahead and sell that.

39:20.976 --> 39:23.111
Get me the cash. You know what?

39:23.145 --> 39:26.281
I don't carry a lighter anymore.

39:26.314 --> 39:27.349
You mind?

39:27.382 --> 39:29.785
It's your world, man.

39:29.818 --> 39:31.319
I just sell dope in it.

39:45.167 --> 39:46.502
Hey, Reed.

39:48.504 --> 39:50.839
Grady had agreed
to cut the prices down.

39:52.174 --> 39:54.643
$9,000 a kilo.

39:54.677 --> 39:56.211
I'm hoping you can honor that.

39:56.244 --> 39:58.180
Let's keep it at ten for now.

39:58.180 --> 40:02.485
Also, Reed's gone.

40:02.518 --> 40:04.587
From here on,
you can call me Teddy.
