00:11.928 --> 00:13.096

00:53.970 --> 00:55.847
Attention, students.

00:55.930 --> 01:00.393
One last reminder to buy your tickets
to tonight's Homecoming Dance.

01:00.477 --> 01:05.690
A magical evening full of wonder,
excitement, and romance can be yours

01:05.774 --> 01:08.109
for only 10.99.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.324
Mark, was that you?
Romance, really? You want to encourage...

01:14.407 --> 01:16.993
So, you going?

01:17.410 --> 01:19.079
- Yeah. Do you...
- Do you...

01:20.955 --> 01:22.540
- You go first.
- Do you need any underwear?

01:23.833 --> 01:25.668
- What?
- Your mom's at Costco.

01:26.169 --> 01:27.879
Um...

01:27.962 --> 01:29.672
- I'm good.
- Okay.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.883
Also, they ran out of your gummy vitamins,

01:31.966 --> 01:34.969
so your mom got you small,
easy to swallow pills. That cool?

01:36.513 --> 01:38.431
- Okay.
- However,

01:38.515 --> 01:42.268
this is not an opportunity to get freaky.

01:42.352 --> 01:48.108
Remember: if you're not responsible,
you'll end up with responsibility.

01:48.566 --> 01:55.573
So, there will be no twerking,
yiking, getting crunk, lit, or turnt.

01:55.657 --> 01:59.035
For all you ladies, dress appropriately.

01:59.410 --> 02:02.455
Nobody wants to see
your lower butt cheeks.

02:02.539 --> 02:04.624
Man, that's some bullshit!
Did you hear that?

02:04.707 --> 02:08.461
Did you hear, no butt cheeks. You know
how many squats I do for these nalgas?

02:08.544 --> 02:11.005
Come on, people, no butt cheeks?

02:11.089 --> 02:16.719
And last but not least:
no ID, no entrance. No exceptions.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.888
That's my cue. Got to roll.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.181
Just a few more minutes.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.683
I have a chem quiz.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.726
How about later? Fifth period?

02:23.810 --> 02:25.478
Can't miss trig. Sixth?

02:25.562 --> 02:29.107
- I could sneak out for ten minutes.
- Hey, so, tonight, will you dance with me?

02:29.190 --> 02:32.944
Of course. I'll dance with you.
And Ruby and Jamal... like always.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.320
What about just me?

02:35.155 --> 02:36.656
Like a slow dance?

02:36.739 --> 02:38.867
No, no, no. Hm-mmm.

02:38.950 --> 02:40.118
Not like a slow dance.

02:42.370 --> 02:43.288
A slow dance.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.625
- No, no slow dancing.
- Why?

02:48.042 --> 02:49.836
- Because we've never done it before.
- So?

02:49.919 --> 02:52.422
We've been doing a lot
we've never done before.

02:53.172 --> 02:56.593
Friends don't slow dance. Especially
friends dodging rumors they've smashed.

02:56.676 --> 02:58.887
Oh, come on, it's just a dance.

02:59.345 --> 03:02.265
Slow dances aren't just dances.
They're statements.

03:02.932 --> 03:04.267
Let's just talk later.

03:04.350 --> 03:05.268
Sixth period?

03:05.768 --> 03:07.270
Sure. We can talk...

03:07.353 --> 03:11.024
about how slow we're gonna dance,
because it's going down.

03:16.821 --> 03:17.739
Shit.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.787
Olivia only sees me in a certain way.

03:24.871 --> 03:28.875
To her, I'm "Inside Ruby," the guy she's
forced to live with and buy underwear for.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.669
Tonight, I got to show her
that I can be "Outside Ruben,"

03:31.753 --> 03:34.172
the guy who not only knows
how to make killer chilaquiles,

03:34.255 --> 03:36.299
but can sexify a lady on the dance floor.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.885
Tonight, I will redefine our relationship.

03:39.260 --> 03:40.970
Awesome. Happy for you.

03:41.054 --> 03:43.514
So, while you and Cesar
are getting sexified on the dance floor...

03:43.598 --> 03:44.849
That's not what I'll be doing.

03:44.933 --> 03:47.602
Whatever. I just wanna know
where I am in this situation.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.687
- I don't know.
- Aha! Exactly!

03:49.771 --> 03:51.439
Because you both always forget about me!

03:51.522 --> 03:53.399
- We don't forget you.
- We ignore you.

03:54.108 --> 03:56.694
- You gotta leave the cane at home.
- Not a cane. It's a pimp stick.

03:56.778 --> 03:57.654
Even worse.

03:57.737 --> 04:00.740
Hey, do I crap on your accessories? No.

04:00.823 --> 04:03.743
Do I think necklaces
are tacky on dudes? Yes.

04:03.826 --> 04:05.286
But I keep that to myself.

04:05.370 --> 04:07.872
So you keep doing you
with that tacky chain,

04:07.956 --> 04:12.126
and I'm gonna roll with my pimp stick
that I need for my foot injury.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.044
That isn't real.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.672
- Why you got to neg me?
- Relax.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.714
No one's gonna neg
or forget you tonight,

04:17.798 --> 04:19.968
'cause this ain't
eighth grade anymore, boys.

04:20.051 --> 04:24.055
It's no "timid hands off."
It's all "confident hands on."

04:24.138 --> 04:26.891
'Cause tonight, everyone's
gonna get loose and bump...

04:26.975 --> 04:29.394
And grind.
High school dances are the worst.

04:29.477 --> 04:32.063
Really? Dances in Houston are dope,

04:32.146 --> 04:33.648
and great opps to meet dudes.

04:33.731 --> 04:34.691
Take a look around.

04:34.774 --> 04:37.110
Every hot prospect you see today
is gonna be sporting wood tonight.

04:37.193 --> 04:40.238
It's not pretty. Or impressive.
Dances are basically sex fests.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.824
- In a bad way?
- Yes. They can expose you.

04:42.907 --> 04:44.909
- How?
- You can get roofied or pregnant.

04:44.993 --> 04:47.328
And I'm not just talking
about getting it in on the dance floor,

04:47.412 --> 04:48.246
which happens all the time.

04:48.329 --> 04:51.291
I'm talking about slipping on something
suspect on the way to the bathroom,

04:51.374 --> 04:53.376
and boom, you're immaculately concepted.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.211
That's why you gotta have
protection on the ready.

04:55.295 --> 04:57.630
One minute you're dancing
next to some rando girl,

04:57.714 --> 05:00.133
the next, you're getting up
and into your new "girlfriend."

05:00.216 --> 05:02.719
- Trying not to get the herp.
- Come on.

05:02.802 --> 05:05.847
Hey, 39 percent of all cases come
from school-sanctioned events.

05:05.930 --> 05:06.848
CDC doesn't lie.

05:06.931 --> 05:10.643
Like I said, a relationship can be
made and redefined by one sexy jam.

05:10.727 --> 05:12.770
You really think a slow dance
can redefine a relationship?

05:12.854 --> 05:13.980
Where have you been?

05:14.063 --> 05:17.650
Dances aren't about dancing.
They're about making statements.

05:17.734 --> 05:20.320
- Positive statements.
- Like peeing every time you jump.

05:20.403 --> 05:23.656
That's what happens after you get prego.
Even if you don't keep it.

05:23.740 --> 05:26.075
Goodbye, romance. Hello, trauma.

05:26.159 --> 05:28.703
Plus the DJ they hired
is some lame hipster from Silver Lake.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.621
DJ Snigglebottoms!

05:30.705 --> 05:33.333
He almost played Coachella,
so he's obviously fire.

05:33.416 --> 05:36.627
I don't know, man. I just don't know
if one dance matters that much.

05:37.170 --> 05:40.214
Okay. What about Sylvia and Jesus, huh?

05:40.673 --> 05:43.301
They barely knew each other last year
before the fall dance.

05:43.384 --> 05:44.844
Until he basically draped her.

05:45.261 --> 05:48.222
- Draped?
- Dance raped. He was all over her.

05:49.098 --> 05:52.602
- She was all over him. In a trance.
- Like a prisoner.

05:52.685 --> 05:55.271
He marked her like a piece of property
so no other guy would touch her.

05:55.354 --> 05:58.191
- Then she had no other option but to...
- ...fall in love.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.108
Look at them.

05:59.859 --> 06:01.319
They're so ride or die.

06:02.361 --> 06:03.571
Stockholm syndrome.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.996
Tonight could be a game changer.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.790
And our own personal hell.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.097
I'm wearing indigo tonight.

06:29.472 --> 06:32.266
I thought we should claim colors
to avoid outfit clashes.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.519
Indigo? Any objections?

06:35.061 --> 06:36.646
Oh, and my pants have red pockets.

06:36.729 --> 06:39.232
I know, it sounds weird, but it works.

06:39.315 --> 06:42.235
What are the pockets for? Roofies?

06:42.318 --> 06:44.320
So, what time should we meet?

06:44.862 --> 06:46.989
Yeah, let's get that in the books.
The more specific, the better.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.367
What are you guys thinking, like 8:00?
8:05? 8:10?

06:49.951 --> 06:51.953
I'm gonna play it by ear.
I'm not sure I'm feeling it.

06:52.036 --> 06:53.788
What? Why?

06:53.871 --> 06:55.456
Not sure I'm in the mood
to be objectified.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.500
If I want to see boners,
I'll just go online.

06:57.583 --> 07:00.795
Didn't you hear Principal Sarge?
The dance is a no-bone zone.

07:00.878 --> 07:03.506
Are you kidding?
Dances are cesspools of bad behavior.

07:04.257 --> 07:05.299
I don't want to go.

07:05.383 --> 07:08.302
Yeah, people get freaky,
but what's wrong with getting freaky?

07:09.595 --> 07:10.471
I don't get it.

07:10.555 --> 07:14.267
Explain it to us. Why don't you wanna go?
You were pretty excited this morning.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.228
That was before I remembered
how lame dances are.

07:17.311 --> 07:19.063
And maybe we're just not in the mood.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.774
Oh, is it your menses?

07:21.858 --> 07:23.025
Her what?

07:23.109 --> 07:26.112
- Her lady pond has runneth red.
- Lady pond?

07:26.779 --> 07:29.657
- What? What am I saying wrong?
- Everything!

07:29.740 --> 07:32.827
You guys don't understand what it's like
to be a woman and treated like an object.

07:32.910 --> 07:34.370
- We have hearts!
- And minds.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.581
So, take out any question
that we're going tonight.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.207
The answer is no.

07:38.291 --> 07:40.960
With a period,
'cause that's what it's actually called.

07:41.794 --> 07:44.338
Olivia, let's go dine
in a less hostile environment.

07:44.755 --> 07:45.798
You read my mind.

07:51.012 --> 07:52.013
What just happened?

08:25.713 --> 08:27.882
Hey! Why are you dodging me?

08:27.965 --> 08:31.636
What you said at lunch really hit home.
I don't want to objectify you.

08:31.719 --> 08:32.553
I was just...

08:33.179 --> 08:35.431
I was just, like, talking
about women in general.

08:35.515 --> 08:37.558
- Not me personally.
- You don't have to back down.

08:38.058 --> 08:39.684
I'm not backing down.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.605
You don't need to tell me
if I can or can't back down. I'm fine!

08:43.731 --> 08:47.235
Okay, what if we skipped the stupid dance?

08:47.860 --> 08:49.946
My dad's on a long haul,
which means that...

08:50.029 --> 08:50.947
Are you objectifying me?

08:53.783 --> 08:55.868
I know what you're doing,
and it's not cute.

08:55.952 --> 08:57.662
No, it's not.

08:57.745 --> 08:59.747
I'm not just your boy toy, Monse.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.707
Maybe it's a good thing
you're not going to the dance.

09:01.791 --> 09:02.625
It is?

09:02.708 --> 09:05.628
Maybe I can find a girl
who's interested in more than my body.

09:05.711 --> 09:09.715
A girl who just likes to dance. Slow.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.765
- We should go to the dance.
- What? Why?

09:17.848 --> 09:20.142
Because we can't let him...
I mean, them win.

09:20.851 --> 09:22.895
No way. We need to stand our ground.

09:22.979 --> 09:26.399
Which is why
we can't sit at home. We have to go.

09:26.899 --> 09:28.442
I'm totally confused.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.361
We're falling prey
to the obvious argument,

09:30.444 --> 09:32.321
which is that we have to sit out
to make a point.

09:32.405 --> 09:35.074
But the point is, we go.
If we don't, they win.

09:35.157 --> 09:37.076
Still confused. How are they winning?

09:37.159 --> 09:38.536
By repressing us!

09:38.619 --> 09:41.789
By staying home, it's like they're
putting us in emotional burkas,

09:41.872 --> 09:43.291
giving us no choice.

09:44.875 --> 09:47.795
I get it. We need to shed the burkas
and flaunt the boobs.

09:48.170 --> 09:50.298
Yes! Our body, our choice.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.927
- We have to go. And look sexy.
- But not for them, for us.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.555
- So, I'm dressing for you.
- And I'm dressing for you.

09:58.556 --> 10:02.018
- Once I figure out how to look sexy.
- It's a good thing you know me.

10:02.518 --> 10:03.853
She doesn't know me!

10:03.936 --> 10:06.480
I'm a feminist. I'm woke.
I never slut shame.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.442
I even have a small collection
of Susan B. Anthony silver dollars.

10:09.525 --> 10:12.778
So, if my girl's gonna stay home,
I gotta support her and stay home too.

10:13.696 --> 10:16.198
So, you're gonna let
the girls' decision dictate yours?

10:16.282 --> 10:19.201
- It's our first high school dance!
- There'll be other dances.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.413
Besides, my parents and the twins
are out tonight,

10:22.496 --> 10:23.998
so Olivia and I can kick it here

10:24.081 --> 10:26.876
and Outside Ruben can make
an inside appearance.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.377
I'm still part of this scenario, right?

10:28.461 --> 10:31.297
If you really wanna be Outside Ruben,
you need to actually go outside

10:31.380 --> 10:33.215
and show Olivia what she's missing.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.180
I say this from experience.
Nothing drives a girl crazier

10:39.263 --> 10:41.932
than knowing someone else
is out there waiting for you.

10:42.016 --> 10:42.850
Trust me!

10:43.643 --> 10:46.687
I don't know, man.
I think I should just stay home.

10:46.771 --> 10:49.857
Good. You can help me
clean the bathroom.

10:49.940 --> 10:51.692
The twins had an accident.

10:51.776 --> 10:54.528
Although, it looks like it was on purpose.

10:55.988 --> 10:59.575
Uh... Sorry, Abuelita,
but I'm going to the dance.

10:59.659 --> 11:00.493
Yes!

11:04.830 --> 11:05.831
Um...

11:06.749 --> 11:09.752
I got to take care of something
for Spooky. Meet you guys later.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.671
Yeah, I should go, too.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.340
What time do you want to meet
so you guys don't forget me?

11:14.423 --> 11:16.050
For the last time,
that's not gonna happen.

11:16.133 --> 11:18.010
Just come back in half an hour.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.429
Or wait, I'm doing a charcoal mask,
better make it 45.

11:22.556 --> 11:25.434
I should do a nose strip, too.
Okay, let's say an hour to be safe.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.894
I'll be back in 50.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.106
Hey.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.247
I'm still going to the dance.

11:46.705 --> 11:49.041
- I thought you had a right to know.
- Cool.

11:50.418 --> 11:53.295
Also, I heard what you said
about objectification

11:53.379 --> 11:55.297
and promise to respect you
as a woman.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.382
Awesome.

11:58.717 --> 12:01.512
Would you like some help with that?
Not that you need it.

12:01.595 --> 12:05.558
We both know you're the stronger gender.
I mean, you have to be for childbirth.

12:05.641 --> 12:08.102
Not that you have to have children.
Fertility does not make a woman.

12:08.185 --> 12:11.397
I would love some help, thanks,
but I'm heading over to Monse's.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.232
Do you have time to carry it over?

12:14.191 --> 12:16.318
Oh... No. I have to get ready.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.321
- Then I'll see you there.
- Where, Monse's?

12:19.405 --> 12:20.990
- The dance.
- You're going?

12:21.073 --> 12:23.451
Yeah, we changed our minds.
We can do that.

12:23.534 --> 12:25.411
I know. I'm woke.

12:25.494 --> 12:28.414
You can't declare yourself woke.
Someone needs to tell you.

12:28.497 --> 12:31.167
Thank you.
Now I'm woke about being woke.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.002
This has been so enlightening.

12:33.377 --> 12:35.379
Should we all go to the dance together?

12:36.380 --> 12:38.632
I thought you had to get ready?

12:39.300 --> 12:41.385
I'm a dude. I'm always ready.

12:49.101 --> 12:50.686
Oh.

12:50.769 --> 12:51.645
I look dumb.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.648
Nah, you look more awkward
than devoid of intellect.

12:55.774 --> 12:59.403
What? The dress looks great!
It's just, she looks awkward in it.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.573
You know how some people are really good

13:02.656 --> 13:04.450
at saying the right thing
at the right time?

13:04.533 --> 13:05.743
Yeah.

13:05.826 --> 13:08.412
You aren't one of those people.
Let me give you some pointers.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.248
- You're so enlightening.
- I'm not suggesting...

13:15.544 --> 13:17.296
- Just think.
- That's an excellent point.

13:17.379 --> 13:21.300
- And then speak.
- I feel you. Makes so much sense.

13:46.659 --> 13:47.493
Let's roll.

13:47.576 --> 13:49.161
- Don't say anything stupid.
- I know.

13:49.245 --> 13:50.663
I need a new outfit.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.044
You know what would look good
with that top?

13:57.127 --> 13:58.045
Heels.

14:02.174 --> 14:03.175
Don't open that!

14:07.096 --> 14:08.973
That's the only stuff
she has of her mom's.

14:09.056 --> 14:11.600
It's sensitive, a sad story
that I can't get into.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.102
Grabbed the wrong one.

14:14.436 --> 14:15.854
I hate when that happens.

14:19.483 --> 14:22.486
Okay, so her mom left when she was two,
and she's not over it.

14:22.570 --> 14:25.281
- But don't ever bring it up unless she...
- All right.

14:26.115 --> 14:28.659
- Which one should I wear?
- I think they all looked good on you.

14:29.034 --> 14:29.952
Ruby?

14:30.661 --> 14:32.413
No, I'm not falling for this again.

14:32.496 --> 14:35.040
Oh, come on. You can't leave her hanging.

14:35.124 --> 14:38.210
You just have to be
honest and sensitive at the same time.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.379
- It's really not that hard.
- Fine.

14:40.462 --> 14:44.174
I think the one she's wearing now
nicely accentuates her figure.

14:45.384 --> 14:47.887
You mean her boobs. Classy.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.264
- I can't win!
- Neither can I. Screw this.

14:50.764 --> 14:53.976
There's nothing different about this dance
than any I've gone to before.

14:54.059 --> 14:57.980
Since I've worn jeans every other time,
I'm wearing jeans and my good hoodie.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.357
If somebody doesn't like it,
they can suck a butt.

15:10.784 --> 15:11.619
Hi.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.298
I'm just... waiting for Ruby.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.221
Do you smell something?

15:33.974 --> 15:35.851
My Lady of Guadalupe.

15:36.977 --> 15:38.854
I didn't know they came in scents.

15:41.231 --> 15:43.525
...with a new piece
of information, and no...

15:43.609 --> 15:45.110
You like to date the line?

15:45.194 --> 15:46.946
What? No, no, no, no, no.

15:47.029 --> 15:48.614
...authorities had their...

15:50.199 --> 15:52.284
Oh, Dateline. Oh, yeah, I'm all over that.

16:02.586 --> 16:03.879
How the hell?

16:05.005 --> 16:06.924
How can they just do that?

16:07.007 --> 16:09.718
Don't be nervous.
I'll be your boner blocker.

16:09.802 --> 16:13.263
- What's happening? What is it?
- Some bullshit is what it is!

16:13.347 --> 16:14.932
They cancelled the dance
because of a fight.

16:15.557 --> 16:16.433
Man, I mean, really?

16:16.517 --> 16:18.519
Two putas got into it
in Life Skills yesterday,

16:18.602 --> 16:21.313
but we still managed to make soufflés.
A fight ain't nothin'!

16:21.397 --> 16:23.565
It wasn't just that.
Some fool pulled out a gun.

16:23.649 --> 16:24.733
Who cares?

16:25.234 --> 16:27.736
It took me forever to get ready.
I even shaved my chocha for this.

16:28.946 --> 16:29.947
And it was a two-man job.

16:33.826 --> 16:35.661
Hey, what's going on?

16:35.744 --> 16:37.705
Dance got cancelled because of a gun.

16:37.788 --> 16:40.874
I was actually really excited about it
and ready to dance.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.918
- Too bad.
- Yeah, it is too bad, huh?

16:43.002 --> 16:46.422
The night doesn't have to be
a total waste. My dad is still gone.

16:47.006 --> 16:49.883
That is a great idea.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.803
Yo, Monse's dad's out of town,
so party at Monse's!

16:54.805 --> 16:55.639
Yeah! Monse!

16:55.723 --> 16:57.266
You said you were ready to dance.

17:00.060 --> 17:03.605
Oh, my God, why are the police
doing this to him? He's white!

17:03.689 --> 17:05.441
Because he's poor.

17:06.108 --> 17:08.694
I'd never, ever cheat or date her.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.948
- How's your restless leg?
- Much better, thank you.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.199
I'm glad.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.202
Ooh. This is nice.

17:17.911 --> 17:21.165
You know, it's hard to find
a kindred spirit who thinks like me.

17:21.248 --> 17:27.296
Someone who knows that the real story
is always the story behind the story.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.884
You know, like Steven Avery or Watergate

17:31.967 --> 17:34.303
or RollerWorld.

17:34.386 --> 17:35.429
RollerWorld?

17:37.931 --> 17:40.225
- What do you know about RollerWorld?
- Nothing.

17:46.690 --> 17:48.400
I know you know something.

17:49.860 --> 17:51.153
I shouldn't have brought it up.

17:51.820 --> 17:54.823
Every time I talk about it, somebody
tells me I'm stupid for believing

17:54.907 --> 17:57.701
that there could be money buried
in the neighborhood.

17:58.911 --> 18:00.662
The only people who are stupid

18:00.746 --> 18:05.125
are the ones who believe those two Santos
robbed that place for 50,000 dollars.

18:06.210 --> 18:07.503
It wasn't 50,000?

18:08.754 --> 18:10.089
- Two-fifty.
- No!

18:10.172 --> 18:14.593
Sí. The Prophets were using RollerWorld
to wash the money.

18:14.676 --> 18:17.971
The Santos didn't even know
what they were getting themselves into.

18:18.347 --> 18:20.099
- "Wash the money"?
- Mm-hmm.

18:20.182 --> 18:23.811
Oh, money laundering. Is that how
the war started between the gangs?

18:23.894 --> 18:26.438
Every story behind a story
has a beginning.

18:29.191 --> 18:30.776
- Then start there.
- Where?

18:31.235 --> 18:32.319
The beginning!

18:36.615 --> 18:41.245
She keeps talking and talking, but that's
the thing: she don't say nothing.

18:41.328 --> 18:44.665
Telling us how to dress appropriately
for dances and stuff,

18:44.748 --> 18:47.918
like, "Oh, your skirt can't be shorter
than your fingertips,"

18:48.001 --> 18:52.297
which is mighty prejudicial to me
because I have long arms,

18:52.381 --> 18:55.551
and she has short, stubby arms. You know?

18:56.176 --> 18:58.762
- Help me.
- Should we throw him a bone?

18:59.221 --> 19:02.015
And get stuck in Jasmine's quicksand?
We'll never get out.

19:02.099 --> 19:05.519
Okay. I'm getting another refill.
You want one?

19:05.602 --> 19:06.436
Yeah.

19:07.896 --> 19:09.481
Hey, play something lit.

19:09.982 --> 19:10.816
On it.

19:32.671 --> 19:33.547
Be right back.

19:45.392 --> 19:47.603
I counted it three times.
Trust me, it's all there.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.939
- I don't want any problems.
- I know. I don't want any either.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.034
Where's that from?

20:04.620 --> 20:07.206
- Ready for our dance?
- Are you crazy carrying that around?

20:07.289 --> 20:09.208
- You're gonna get yourself killed.
- Don't worry about it.

20:10.042 --> 20:11.710
Worry about this.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.923
Oh.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.013
Hey.

20:23.096 --> 20:24.848
Hey! Perfect timing.

20:25.390 --> 20:28.894
- Cesar, enough! I hate tickling.
- I'm sorry. I had to leave that room.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.647
Jasmine was threatening
to show us her "two-man job."

20:31.730 --> 20:34.066
- Seriously, I'll cover my eyes.
- No.

20:34.691 --> 20:35.609
You're saving me.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.946
We were just being stupid. Come here.

20:45.369 --> 20:46.286
Thanks.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.332
I definitely interrupted something.

20:50.415 --> 20:52.000
Nope. Nothing.

20:52.501 --> 20:55.003
Just so you know, I keep shit private.
I don't gossip.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.588
I'm all about that lock and key.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.341
No doubt.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.717
But Monse and I are just friends.

21:01.260 --> 21:03.804
Really? You guys seem
like you'd be together.

21:04.638 --> 21:05.847
Monse's out of my league.

21:07.474 --> 21:10.102
So, you've never, ever thought
of getting together?

21:10.602 --> 21:12.062
No. Would never happen.

21:12.145 --> 21:14.147
- Why?
- He's not safe.

21:20.320 --> 21:21.947
That's hilarious.

21:22.030 --> 21:22.864
Totally.

21:26.201 --> 21:27.452
I'm gonna go grab a shot.

21:28.036 --> 21:29.121
- Okay.
- Okay.

21:35.377 --> 21:38.714
I know if I had that much cash,
I wouldn't bury it.

21:39.423 --> 21:42.134
I'd buy the new Jordans
and probably a new metal detector.

21:42.217 --> 21:44.011
And if there was anything left,
I'd invest in solar.

21:44.094 --> 21:45.679
The Santos had to hide the money.

21:45.762 --> 21:48.181
They were feeling the heat
from the Prophets and Feds.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.100
So they hid it before they got arrested.

21:50.183 --> 21:52.644
I guess they didn't know
they'd be killed in prison.

21:52.728 --> 21:53.770
Hmm.

21:53.854 --> 21:56.231
- Think they left the money with family?
- No.

21:56.315 --> 22:00.444
Benito's family owned a smoke shop
that I used to... walk by.

22:00.902 --> 22:03.655
And when it burned down,
they couldn't afford to rebuild.

22:03.739 --> 22:05.198
What about the other guy, Frankie?

22:06.241 --> 22:08.118
He was stupid, but nice.

22:08.201 --> 22:12.539
I made a dress for his girlfriend once,
and he left me a good tip.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.125
If...

22:15.834 --> 22:19.921
If I go through my old receipts,
I could probably find her name.

22:20.005 --> 22:22.341
- Why do that?
- Maybe it could lead to something.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.218
No, don't worry about it.

22:25.302 --> 22:28.597
If nobody's found the money by now,
it's not gonna be me.

22:29.222 --> 22:30.682
Mijo.

22:32.350 --> 22:33.643
Come here.

22:34.770 --> 22:35.645
Ah.

22:35.729 --> 22:36.855
Why not you?

22:37.773 --> 22:40.650
Because it's one thing
to think about finding the money,

22:40.734 --> 22:43.320
but what are the chances I actually could?

22:43.403 --> 22:44.696
Slim to none. So?

22:44.780 --> 22:47.532
So I just don't see myself as someone
who could do something this...

22:47.616 --> 22:48.533
Special?

22:51.078 --> 22:55.123
If you don't try, it will haunt you
the rest of your life.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.250
Somebody has to find that money.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.127
Why can't it be you, Hamal?

22:59.878 --> 23:01.088
- Jamal.
- Hamal...

23:01.546 --> 23:04.257
every story behind a story
has a beginning.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.593
What if this one was yours?

23:10.430 --> 23:12.099
Ruby's not here, is he?

23:20.482 --> 23:21.566
Where did Ruby go?

23:21.983 --> 23:23.151
I'm here.

23:24.903 --> 23:25.904
I'm here!

23:28.323 --> 23:30.826
My breath is fading!

23:33.078 --> 23:34.579
- Where am I?
- My house.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.498
Oh, thank God.

23:37.833 --> 23:39.751
She threatened to drag me to Pimp Lane.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.503
That's when I passed out.

23:43.130 --> 23:44.464
Please tell me nothing happened.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.133
I'm all about consent.

23:46.633 --> 23:48.260
That's very noble.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.011
You deserve a dance.

23:55.809 --> 23:57.519
Might be easier to drink from the bottle.

23:58.687 --> 24:01.940
You guys aren't going to make us
dance by ourselves, are you?

24:04.067 --> 24:05.902
You heard her. It's now or never.

24:07.445 --> 24:09.156
- Come here.
- No.

24:10.782 --> 24:11.741
Why?

24:13.076 --> 24:14.327
I'm not safe.
