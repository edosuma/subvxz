No.

07:49.435 --> 07:52.678
Oh... Okay... Okay...

07:53.372 --> 07:55.045
Let's see what...

07:56.876 --> 07:58.378
What...

10:05.471 --> 10:06.745
Good morning!

10:07.673 --> 10:08.674
Hello?

10:10.176 --> 10:11.246
Mr. Leland!

10:15.715 --> 10:17.251
Hello, Mr. Leland.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.392
You're not Yolanda.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.257
I'm Marisol. I'm your aide for the day.

10:24.590 --> 10:25.898
Where's Yolanda?

10:25.992 --> 10:28.836
She isn't feeling well today,
so the agency sent me in her place.

10:29.161 --> 10:31.198
But don't worry; I have your file.

10:31.263 --> 10:32.901
I'll take good care of you, okay?

10:32.999 --> 10:34.706
Yolanda's never late.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.011
I'm sorry.

10:37.069 --> 10:38.571
You took the freeway?

10:39.271 --> 10:40.271
I did.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.914
Oh, wrong thing to do
when you're in a hurry.

10:46.012 --> 10:47.423
Shall I make you your breakfast?

10:48.280 --> 10:50.282
I'm not hungry.

10:53.019 --> 10:56.933
Here. Would you give me some help on that?

10:57.757 --> 10:59.464
- Of course. Let's see.
- Yeah.

10:59.558 --> 11:00.866
Put that through there.

11:00.926 --> 11:03.634
- The damn thing won't go through for me...
- Oh, okay.

11:03.729 --> 11:06.710
The agency didn't tell me
you were scheduled to go somewhere.

11:07.199 --> 11:09.145
Do you have an appointment
today, Mr. Leland?

11:13.706 --> 11:15.583
Well, you look very handsome.

11:18.577 --> 11:19.577
There.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.086
Are you sure you're not hungry?

11:21.147 --> 11:22.421
Oh, I'm sure.

11:23.716 --> 11:25.457
How about some coffee or some tea?

11:28.120 --> 11:29.120
Tea.

11:29.755 --> 11:31.757
- Okay.
- Not too hot.

11:32.291 --> 11:33.827
Uh. Four sugars.

11:34.660 --> 11:35.968
And no milk, right?

11:36.629 --> 11:38.506
And no milk, that's right.

11:45.237 --> 11:49.515
You be sure to tighten those
faucet handles when you're...

11:49.909 --> 11:51.650
when you're done out there.

11:53.412 --> 11:54.413
Okay-

12:00.419 --> 12:01.489
Mr. Leland.

12:02.121 --> 12:05.364
Should I call the agency to check
if you have an appointment scheduled?

12:06.659 --> 12:09.606
No, don't bother. There's nothing for me.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.271
Why are you all dressed up?

12:16.535 --> 12:18.014
I have my reason.

12:32.184 --> 12:33.686
Did you take your morning meds?

12:34.120 --> 12:35.690
- No.
- Be careful.

12:36.188 --> 12:37.963
- I got it.
- Okay.

12:38.023 --> 12:40.196
I'll get you a glass of water
so you can take them.

12:40.292 --> 12:41.669
Don't bother. Don't bother.

12:41.727 --> 12:44.003
You have to take your
morning meds, Mr. Leland.

12:44.363 --> 12:47.344
I don't have to take anything anymore.

12:52.338 --> 12:54.045
I said four sugars.

12:54.140 --> 12:55.642
Too much sugar isn't good for you.

12:55.708 --> 12:58.154
It hasn't killed me in 91 years.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.245
Okay, fine.

12:59.812 --> 13:01.223
I'll put in another sugar.

13:02.214 --> 13:04.216
I don't want it anymore; never mind.

13:04.550 --> 13:05.551
Are you sure?

13:05.918 --> 13:07.192
I'm sure.

13:08.053 --> 13:09.396
<i>Paciencia.</i>

13:09.488 --> 13:11.229
What'd you say your name was?

13:12.925 --> 13:13.926
Marisol.

13:14.994 --> 13:19.101
Yolanda was from El Salvador.
Where are you from?

13:20.699 --> 13:21.699
Cuba.

13:22.101 --> 13:24.547
Cuba? Cuba...

13:26.105 --> 13:28.949
I hear they got some pretty good
ballplayers down there.

13:29.041 --> 13:30.418
You like baseball?

13:31.844 --> 13:33.551
I don't really know much about it.

13:34.880 --> 13:35.881
Oh...

13:38.017 --> 13:40.088
I like to watch basketball sometimes.

13:40.753 --> 13:42.027
Do you like basketball?

13:43.389 --> 13:45.528
Basketball is all show.

13:46.058 --> 13:49.267
The only game worth watching is baseball.

13:50.629 --> 13:53.633
The Dodgers is the only team
worth pulling for,

13:53.732 --> 13:56.804
and the Yankees are the only team
worth pulling against.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.415
And why don't you like the Yankees?

14:01.907 --> 14:03.784
I don't know.

14:04.476 --> 14:07.423
I just... I just don't.

14:07.913 --> 14:09.256
Mr. Leland, let me help you.

14:10.616 --> 14:14.291
Oh, no. Leave me be.
Leave me be. Leave me be.

14:26.999 --> 14:28.569
Are you expecting someone?

14:29.969 --> 14:31.346
That a new cal'?

14:32.071 --> 14:34.449
I'm not allowed to take you
anywhere, Mr. Leland.

14:34.506 --> 14:37.282
I didn't ask you to take me anywhere.

14:37.810 --> 14:40.620
I'm sorry. I thought maybe
you wanted to go somewhere.

14:40.679 --> 14:42.158
What time is it?

14:42.815 --> 14:43.816
Uh...

14:44.316 --> 14:45.454
It's 9:18.

14:45.517 --> 14:46.825
Oh, I guess my...

14:47.519 --> 14:50.295
My appetite isn't
all the way gone just yet.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.097
I'll make you your breakfast.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.700
Yeah, okay.

14:56.462 --> 14:57.462
Okay-

15:04.503 --> 15:08.645
Yolanda fixes me a fried egg
and a little bit of toast.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.209
It's all in your file.

15:11.110 --> 15:13.283
I'll have it ready for you
in just a few minutes.

15:13.612 --> 15:15.489
Then, we can take our medicine, okay?

15:19.451 --> 15:22.728
Be sure to tighten up those faucets
when you're done.

15:24.390 --> 15:25.801
Okay, Mr. Leland.

15:26.358 --> 15:29.464
You're almost out of milk.
I'll put it on your grocery list.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.371
I don't need any more milk.

15:31.664 --> 15:34.474
Mr. Leland, you only have a little left.

15:36.168 --> 15:39.308
I said, I don't need any more!

15:40.639 --> 15:41.811
Okay, fine.

15:53.752 --> 15:57.700
Would you like some fruit?
I saw a peach in your refrigerator.

15:58.157 --> 15:59.659
I don't want the peach.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.603
Okay, maybe later.

16:08.367 --> 16:10.677
If there is something Yolanda usually does

16:10.736 --> 16:13.012
that you'd like me to do
that's not in your file,

16:14.273 --> 16:15.775
you just let me know, okay?

16:18.110 --> 16:21.114
Well, just tell Yolanda
I don't need her anymore.

16:21.780 --> 16:22.780
What?

16:23.582 --> 16:27.086
I would appreciate it
if you just tell her that I said...

16:29.388 --> 16:31.231
"Thank you" and "Goodbye."

16:32.257 --> 16:35.101
Mr. Leland, I'm only here for today.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.605
Maybe tomorrow if I'm assigned.

16:38.230 --> 16:41.234
But Yolanda will be back here
to take care of you like always.

16:42.868 --> 16:44.370
She was good to me.

16:45.104 --> 16:46.981
Why don't you want her to come any more?

16:55.814 --> 16:56.986
<i>Mr. Leland.</i>

16:59.918 --> 17:01.295
Because...

17:01.653 --> 17:03.155
Because why, Mr. Leland?

17:04.289 --> 17:05.733
I'm going to die...

17:06.625 --> 17:07.625
today.

17:08.926 --> 17:10.667
Why would you say such a thing?

17:12.765 --> 17:15.575
Because it's true.
- It's not true.

17:15.934 --> 17:17.810
And you shouldn't say things like that.

17:18.270 --> 17:20.113
Why would you say something like that?

17:22.141 --> 17:23.279
I saw it.

17:23.942 --> 17:26.115
Saw what? What did you see?

17:27.112 --> 17:28.182
Bright light...

17:29.481 --> 17:34.521
like summer sunshine through
the leaves of the old red oak tree

17:34.620 --> 17:37.123
I used to climb when I was a boy.

17:38.090 --> 17:42.038
Only it was... was white with the light.

17:43.195 --> 17:44.333
Beautiful.

17:44.863 --> 17:46.171
And peaceful.

17:47.366 --> 17:50.939
I woke up knowing I was going to die.

17:51.637 --> 17:52.637
Today.

17:54.373 --> 17:57.286
I don't know why He wanted me to know,

17:57.342 --> 17:58.616
but He showed me.

17:59.845 --> 18:02.883
Today... is the day...

18:05.050 --> 18:06.051
Who showed you?

18:06.452 --> 18:08.022
Who showed you, Mr. Leland?

18:10.489 --> 18:11.559
God.

18:13.392 --> 18:17.067
God showed me His light calling me home.

18:20.332 --> 18:21.333
I'm...

18:22.501 --> 18:23.501
ready...

18:25.704 --> 18:28.913
I'm... I got myself ready to...

18:29.842 --> 18:30.842
I'm ready.

18:31.076 --> 18:32.919
It's all in your mind, Mr. Leland.

18:33.545 --> 18:35.354
And I preferred you keep it there.

18:36.248 --> 18:38.250
I don't want to talk about such things.

18:40.686 --> 18:41.926
Finish your breakfast.

18:42.354 --> 18:44.163
I'm done.

18:44.523 --> 18:46.002
You didn't even touch your eggs!

18:48.227 --> 18:50.002
I said I was finished.

18:57.569 --> 19:00.914
You tighten the faucets there
when you're done.

19:01.006 --> 19:02.713
You don't have to keep telling me!

19:09.114 --> 19:12.061
Sign your timesheet for the day,
and you can go.

19:12.117 --> 19:13.391
You don't have to be here.

19:13.452 --> 19:17.025
I do need to be here, Mr. Leland!
You need my help!

19:20.125 --> 19:21.433
Not anymore.

19:35.207 --> 19:37.380
I keep track of my days.

19:38.410 --> 19:41.983
I've been doing that since I retired.

19:44.416 --> 19:45.918
What kind of work did you do?

19:47.319 --> 19:50.493
I drove a city bus, 40 years.

19:51.423 --> 19:52.902
That's a very long time.

19:54.760 --> 19:57.001
Never missed a day on the job.

19:58.797 --> 20:00.743
How long have you been retired?

20:02.301 --> 20:03.405
Too long.

20:05.404 --> 20:08.977
Like being in prison, I imagine.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.280
How is that?

20:12.811 --> 20:15.348
If you don't keep counting your days...

20:17.516 --> 20:19.359
then your days don't count.

20:20.185 --> 20:21.789
And if they don't count...

20:23.655 --> 20:24.793
you don't count.

20:26.458 --> 20:29.200
I think a lot of people
live their lives...

20:29.928 --> 20:30.998
not counting.

20:32.264 --> 20:36.007
You're saying such
sad things today, Mr. Leland.

20:36.702 --> 20:38.511
And I really wish you wouldn't.

20:41.039 --> 20:43.349
You're a Catholic, aren't you?

20:44.109 --> 20:45.144
Why do you ask?

20:46.111 --> 20:50.685
Do you believe that you'll be accountable
for your earthly deeds

20:51.216 --> 20:53.059
on the day of judgement?

20:53.352 --> 20:55.889
Mr. Leland, I'm not here
to discuss religion.

20:56.555 --> 20:59.229
Well, I'm not a Catholic,
but I am a Christian.

20:59.791 --> 21:04.069
And I'm afraid I'm going to have
a lot of explaining to do

21:04.162 --> 21:06.403
when I meet my maker today.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.402
Mr. Leland, please.

21:09.167 --> 21:11.477
That kind of talk makes me uncomfortable.

21:13.071 --> 21:15.415
Why does it make you uncomfortable?

21:16.541 --> 21:17.884
It's my judgement clay.

21:17.976 --> 21:19.683
It's no one's judgement day!

21:19.745 --> 21:22.589
It's mine! It's mine.

21:23.382 --> 21:25.020
Please, Mr. Leland.

21:25.817 --> 21:27.888
I don't want to hear that
kind of talk anymore.

21:51.176 --> 21:52.917
I made sure they were tight.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.886
Doesn't mean that they are.

22:17.636 --> 22:19.206
<i>What's wrong, Mr. Leland?</i>

22:19.905 --> 22:20.975
Are you <i>hot?</i>

22:21.640 --> 22:24.314
Well, maybe if you take off
your jacket and tie,

22:24.409 --> 22:25.479
you won't feel so hot.

22:25.577 --> 22:27.318
It's not the clothes!

22:27.913 --> 22:29.586
It's just damn hot!

22:36.221 --> 22:37.928
Let me do that for you.

22:39.458 --> 22:42.302
I've just... been opening and closing it.

22:42.794 --> 22:44.796
Well, are you going to do it or not?

22:45.263 --> 22:47.402
- Well, you're in my way!
- Let's do it. Let's do it.

22:47.466 --> 22:52.472
I've been opening and closing
that thing for 50 years. Go on.

22:56.475 --> 22:57.954
Is that open enough?

23:00.479 --> 23:05.451
Oh. Yes, that's... that's enough.

23:07.753 --> 23:08.823
That's enough.

23:10.422 --> 23:12.095
Would you like something cold to drink?

23:15.994 --> 23:17.166
Oh, yeah.

23:17.863 --> 23:20.776
A strawberry milkshake from McDonald's.

23:21.433 --> 23:23.106
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Leland.

23:23.468 --> 23:27.143
Once I arrive on duty, I'm not supposed
to leave until I finish my shift.

23:27.506 --> 23:30.953
Well, you should've thought of that
before you asked the question.

23:31.676 --> 23:35.180
Not everything a man wants
is in his house.

23:35.280 --> 23:36.816
How about a glass of water with ice?

23:36.882 --> 23:39.556
No, no, it's cooled off now. You...

23:40.218 --> 23:42.061
You can close the window.

23:42.954 --> 23:45.901
Okay, Mr. Leland. I'll close the window.

24:14.820 --> 24:16.356
It's a beautiful day.

24:17.823 --> 24:18.893
Hm?

24:23.395 --> 24:24.874
What time is it?

24:27.933 --> 24:29.344
It's 10:15.

24:29.835 --> 24:34.511
Oh. My radio! Get my radio!
It's in my room.

24:34.573 --> 24:36.018
- Of course.
- Yes.

24:36.842 --> 24:37.843
Hurry up.

24:39.611 --> 24:41.113
You want to listen to some music?

24:41.213 --> 24:45.218
No, I don't want to listen to music.
I got a record player for that.

24:45.283 --> 24:48.890
The game's on!
I'd almost forgot the game was on.

24:48.954 --> 24:50.092
What game?

24:51.690 --> 24:52.964
The ball game!

24:53.725 --> 24:57.298
It's just down there
by the nightstand on the floor.

25:01.266 --> 25:02.939
The game's not on television?

25:06.471 --> 25:09.941
The set's been broken for years.

25:11.576 --> 25:12.816
Just as well.

25:13.211 --> 25:17.250
I'd have to get cable
and the sports package.

25:19.084 --> 25:20.757
A man would have to be crazy

25:20.819 --> 25:26.167
to pay to see his home team
on his own television set.

25:38.336 --> 25:39.337
You see it?

25:42.674 --> 25:43.618
Found it.

25:43.675 --> 25:45.848
Well, come on! Bring it out here!

25:46.978 --> 25:48.252
The game's on!

25:50.582 --> 25:52.789
Bring it over here. Put it right there.

25:53.818 --> 25:56.765
And plug it in right there.

25:56.821 --> 25:57.697
Okay-

25:57.789 --> 25:58.790
That's right.

26:01.092 --> 26:02.372
Would you like me to turn it on?

26:02.460 --> 26:05.930
No, no, we've got to wiggle the button.

26:06.264 --> 26:07.971
- Okay.
- You know how it is.

26:08.033 --> 26:10.343
Is it okay if I sit
on the couch and study?

26:10.435 --> 26:12.847
Yeah, you go over there. Be quiet.

26:16.274 --> 26:18.618
<i>The ball takes a hop, and he's out.</i>

26:18.677 --> 26:19.849
Oh, damn.

26:20.345 --> 26:21.345
Damn.

26:21.546 --> 26:24.220
<i>It was an off-speed pitch.
Couldn't get any wood on it.</i>

26:24.316 --> 26:26.327
<i>But that's the hit and run
they wanted, right there...</i>

26:26.351 --> 26:27.352
What is that?

26:29.054 --> 26:30.054
This?

26:30.689 --> 26:32.134
Yes, that.

26:32.490 --> 26:33.491
An iPad.

26:34.659 --> 26:35.659
A tablet.

26:36.995 --> 26:38.372
A kind of computer.

26:39.464 --> 26:41.910
Let me show you something like magic.

26:42.000 --> 26:44.207
No, I... I...

26:44.302 --> 26:48.182
I'll stick with the baseball game
on the radio here.

26:48.239 --> 26:49.650
Okay, maybe later.

26:50.342 --> 26:51.480
Oh, yes.

26:55.847 --> 26:58.088
<i>This is McCarthy's tenth start
this season.</i>

26:58.183 --> 27:00.857
<i>The lanky right hander
sits at four wins...</i>

27:00.919 --> 27:04.332
Radio's all we had when I was a boy.

27:07.359 --> 27:08.360
Radio...

27:09.728 --> 27:11.605
teased your imagination.

27:13.365 --> 27:15.845
It was before your time.

27:15.900 --> 27:19.109
We only had a radio in the house
when I was a little girl.

27:20.438 --> 27:21.508
No television.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.115
Nobody I knew had a television.

27:24.609 --> 27:25.609
Uh-huh.

27:26.177 --> 27:30.250
Bet my bottom dollar
Castro had a very nice one.

27:31.883 --> 27:33.362
He always had everything.

27:36.454 --> 27:39.594
Heard he was a pretty good
baseball player, Castro.

27:39.691 --> 27:43.195
Say that he could have played
in the big leagues.

27:43.528 --> 27:44.528
A myth.

27:46.064 --> 27:48.567
Yeah, I never believed it.

27:49.634 --> 27:50.874
Man like him.

27:52.103 --> 27:54.310
What do you know about Castro, Mr. Leland?

27:54.939 --> 27:56.316
I know that...

27:57.542 --> 28:01.991
Commie son of a bitch
almost destroyed Cuba...

28:02.781 --> 28:06.126
getting into a war with us
that he couldn't win.

28:07.052 --> 28:10.465
Castro did not need a war
with America to destroy Cuba.

28:11.456 --> 28:14.403
He only needed to deny
its people their freedom.

28:16.428 --> 28:19.170
The destruction comes from
their desperation.

28:19.998 --> 28:21.671
<i>Base hit!</i>

28:21.766 --> 28:22.972
Oh, damn.

28:24.135 --> 28:25.136
Damn.

28:25.603 --> 28:28.447
<i>Yankees aren't being shy
about getting things going early.</i>

28:28.506 --> 28:31.817
<i>Taking full advantage of
unfortunate errors by the boys in blue.</i>

28:31.910 --> 28:32.911
Well...

28:34.846 --> 28:38.123
What... What are you...
What are you studying?

28:39.084 --> 28:41.155
Human Anatomy and Physiology.

28:42.187 --> 28:43.996
You going to be a doctor?

28:44.956 --> 28:46.162
I'm going to be a nurse.

28:48.293 --> 28:50.295
My mother wanted to be a nurse.

28:51.296 --> 28:55.142
Her parents couldn't afford
to let her go off to school.

28:55.200 --> 28:57.806
So she stayed put and...

28:58.169 --> 29:01.480
met and married my father.

29:01.539 --> 29:03.541
Well then, it worked out for the best.

29:04.042 --> 29:06.318
It worked out the way it worked out.

29:06.377 --> 29:09.517
My mother never said
one way or the other, bad or good.

29:12.450 --> 29:15.021
I only study part-time, online.

29:16.020 --> 29:17.020
Online?

29:17.956 --> 29:19.333
Over the Internet?

29:20.725 --> 29:21.726
Internet.

29:22.393 --> 29:24.031
Yes, I've heard of that.

29:25.029 --> 29:27.066
I don't know much about it.

29:28.366 --> 29:30.710
It's amazing. <i>Miré.</i>

29:32.637 --> 29:34.639
Right now I'm studying a textbook.

29:38.076 --> 29:38.918
Oh.

29:39.010 --> 29:43.925
It even has a GPS app that will tell you
how to get anywhere you want to go.

29:44.215 --> 29:47.662
That's how I found your house,
and that's howl got here this morning.

29:48.753 --> 29:50.699
Tell you to get on the freeway?

29:51.389 --> 29:52.595
<i>Pues</i> Si, it did.

29:54.692 --> 29:58.196
They say you can access all the knowledge
in the world over the Internet.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.166
Well...

30:04.102 --> 30:06.378
I mean... anything?

30:07.739 --> 30:09.514
Anything. Anything at all.

30:09.574 --> 30:10.712
Well, what?

30:11.409 --> 30:12.409
Look.

30:16.748 --> 30:17.749
Name something.

30:19.884 --> 30:21.295
Name something. Anything.

30:21.386 --> 30:25.562
Um... Baseball... I... I don't know.

30:26.291 --> 30:28.532
Anything. Anything you want
about baseball.

30:29.260 --> 30:30.260
Uh...

30:31.930 --> 30:38.108
Game Seven, 1955 World Series.

30:39.771 --> 30:44.277
Best game the Dodgers ever played
against the Yankees.

30:44.742 --> 30:46.744
They were still in Brooklyn then.

30:47.378 --> 30:48.755
You got that on there?

30:50.281 --> 30:52.283
- Hm?
- See?

30:54.118 --> 30:55.256
Oh!

30:56.387 --> 30:57.457
Oh, my...

30:58.790 --> 30:59.790
Yeah.

31:00.992 --> 31:03.598
I remember this day. It was a Tuesday.

31:04.162 --> 31:06.642
I listened to it on my transistor radio.

31:06.731 --> 31:07.731
A little thing.

31:08.499 --> 31:10.775
Oh, I was so excited.

31:11.236 --> 31:15.582
Oh, that's the Dodgers...
got the last out and won it all...

31:15.940 --> 31:21.014
And I drove through a stoplight,
and I damn near wrecked a bus.

31:23.014 --> 31:24.014
Yes.

31:25.016 --> 31:26.586
Seeing it like this...

31:28.119 --> 31:29.325
Oh, my.

31:30.955 --> 31:34.300
No wires or... antenna.

31:35.660 --> 31:36.798
Anything.

31:37.428 --> 31:39.430
Like I said, it's like magic.

31:40.665 --> 31:41.803
Oh.

31:42.634 --> 31:44.978
Yeah, magic. Mm-hmm.

31:48.273 --> 31:52.312
I remember when I was a boy...

31:54.178 --> 31:58.991
There was a colored man came through
the neighborhood, called himself "C.W."

31:59.951 --> 32:00.951
C.W.

32:01.953 --> 32:07.198
He sold fruits and vegetables
on the back of his little wagon,

32:07.292 --> 32:09.795
which was being pulled by an old mule.

32:11.696 --> 32:15.200
I loved to walk with him
sometimes so I could...

32:16.634 --> 32:18.375
listen to him talk.

32:19.537 --> 32:22.882
He was from Georgia, and l... l just, uh...

32:23.308 --> 32:26.755
loved to listen and hear him

32:27.145 --> 32:30.854
say the things he said
because I liked the way he said them.

32:32.050 --> 32:33.050
You know.

32:33.251 --> 32:37.927
Well, the one clay he told me about
a squirrel hunt that he went on...

32:38.022 --> 32:41.094
out in the woods
and shot a squirrel and he got...

32:41.192 --> 32:44.264
And the darn thing didn't
come down out of the tree.

32:44.662 --> 32:47.040
So, he had to...

32:47.498 --> 32:51.571
He had to climb up that tree, up the top
there wherever that squirrel was,

32:51.669 --> 32:55.048
and he reached in there get that...
sure enough, dead squirrel.

32:56.574 --> 33:01.717
And then he heard this terrible racket
up above him, and he looked up...

33:02.113 --> 33:07.392
And he saw this white man
in a flying contraption!

33:09.120 --> 33:13.466
And he got so scared he just let go
of everything: the squirrel, the limb.

33:13.558 --> 33:18.303
He fell right down there to the ground
and ran on home and...

33:18.629 --> 33:22.941
He told his momma what he saw
and... and she...

33:24.135 --> 33:26.046
whooped him three times.

33:26.104 --> 33:28.277
One for losing the squirrel.

33:28.373 --> 33:33.482
Two for losing Daddy's .22 rifle.

33:33.578 --> 33:38.960
And three for lying about
a white man in a flying contraption!

33:42.820 --> 33:48.668
Aw, C.W. had never heard of an airplane.

33:48.960 --> 33:50.439
Can you imagine that?

33:51.996 --> 33:53.168
I don't know.

33:53.264 --> 33:54.607
Let me show you something.

34:04.108 --> 34:05.610
Look. Say something.

34:05.676 --> 34:06.676
That's me.

34:07.011 --> 34:09.081
Yes, I'm recording a video of us.

34:09.746 --> 34:11.454
Say something.

34:11.815 --> 34:13.693
I don't have anything to say.

34:14.018 --> 34:16.692
Mr. Leland, you know that's not true.

34:16.788 --> 34:18.460
- Oh, I don't.
- Say hello.

34:19.690 --> 34:23.001
- Turn that thing off. I don't...
- No, no, no, look. It's fun!

34:23.094 --> 34:25.870
- Look, it's you and me.
- I don't want to do...

34:26.130 --> 34:27.666
I don't want to be on that.

34:27.764 --> 34:30.005
- Just say, "Hello."
- No.

34:31.034 --> 34:32.034
No.

34:32.837 --> 34:34.009
Okay-

34:38.509 --> 34:40.716
Shut it off. Shut it off.

34:41.045 --> 34:42.319
There, I deleted it.

34:42.847 --> 34:43.848
It's gone now.

34:45.283 --> 34:47.524
Some things are best left undone.

34:49.219 --> 34:52.724
Maybe you could go over there
and sit, please, and be quiet,

34:52.824 --> 34:55.737
and let me listen to my ball game.

34:57.795 --> 34:58.796
I'm sorry.

35:07.238 --> 35:13.245
<i>- Full contact. It's out of here. Home run!
- Oh, damn. Damn Yankees.</i>

35:21.385 --> 35:23.331
Oh, why are you waiting?

35:23.855 --> 35:25.061
Why are you waiting?

35:25.156 --> 35:27.568
I'm here. I'm ready.

35:27.992 --> 35:29.403
Why are you waiting?

35:30.995 --> 35:34.670
Why are you waiting? Why is this...

35:35.199 --> 35:37.076
Reach down to me.

35:37.702 --> 35:40.774
Why are you keeping me waiting?

35:42.173 --> 35:43.173
Come.

35:43.541 --> 35:45.521
Mr. Leland, sit back down.

35:46.944 --> 35:48.753
- Oh...
- Mr. Leland.

35:49.347 --> 35:51.953
<i>It's outta here! A home run!</i>

36:11.736 --> 36:13.044
<i>Mr. Leland.</i>

36:14.405 --> 36:15.907
Wake up, Mr. Leland.

36:17.975 --> 36:19.613
"Shut eyes ain't asleep."

36:20.745 --> 36:23.055
C.W. just now told me that.

36:26.284 --> 36:28.662
Dodgers came back and won!

36:29.487 --> 36:31.899
I know. I listened.

36:32.823 --> 36:33.823
You did?

36:34.125 --> 36:35.126
I did.

36:36.127 --> 36:40.234
I didn't understand everything,
but I really liked the announcer.

36:40.932 --> 36:44.470
"Fastball hammered into right field!

36:44.569 --> 36:47.516
It is high! It is long!

36:47.605 --> 36:50.313
It is gone!"

36:50.408 --> 36:52.149
That's not bad.

36:52.843 --> 36:55.915
I think I'm going to pull
for the Dodgers from now on.

36:55.980 --> 36:57.755
And against the Yankees.

36:57.815 --> 36:59.522
And against the Yankees.

36:59.617 --> 37:03.793
The Dodgers won six
World Series titles, you know.

37:03.854 --> 37:04.854
Is that a lot?

37:04.922 --> 37:06.993
Only the Yankees have won more.

37:07.091 --> 37:08.502
Damn Yankees!

37:08.593 --> 37:12.973
You're damn... That's right!
That's right. Damn Yankees.

37:13.998 --> 37:15.102
<i>Mr. Leland.</i>

37:15.933 --> 37:16.933
<i>Mr. Leland.</i>

37:17.501 --> 37:18.707
Wake up Mr. Leland.

37:21.672 --> 37:23.549
It's time for your afternoon meds.

37:24.475 --> 37:27.479
Game One wasn't a game; it was a miracle.

37:28.446 --> 37:34.226
The bottom of the ninth, two outs,
three balls, and two strikes...

37:35.286 --> 37:38.199
Eckersley throws the ball.

37:38.789 --> 37:40.632
And Gibson found it.

37:41.225 --> 37:42.295
All Of it.

37:43.494 --> 37:47.738
High fly ball into right field.

37:48.165 --> 37:51.874
<i>Sax waiting on deck,
but the game right now is at the plate.</i>

37:55.573 --> 38:00.249
<i>High fly ball into right field.
She is gone!</i>

38:01.345 --> 38:03.382
That ball was gone...

38:04.715 --> 38:06.991
and it was never coming back.

38:10.721 --> 38:12.826
Oh, listen to that.

38:13.257 --> 38:18.673
That's the sound of 56,000 believers
who got their prayers answered.

38:19.563 --> 38:20.837
I was there.

38:21.499 --> 38:25.743
I was one of those
in that crowd of believers.

38:26.871 --> 38:32.787
A's were supposed to sweep the series,
and the Dodgers won in five.

38:33.678 --> 38:37.592
<i>In a year that has been so improbable,</i>

38:37.682 --> 38:40.253
<i>the impossible has happened.</i>

38:44.689 --> 38:46.930
Baseball was better back then.

38:49.527 --> 38:52.474
The players, especially the good ones,

38:53.597 --> 38:55.440
they respected the game.

38:56.734 --> 38:57.974
Were you a good player'?

38:59.136 --> 39:00.240
Oh.

39:00.304 --> 39:02.477
I saw the pictures on your dresser.

39:05.109 --> 39:07.055
I played in the bush leagues

39:07.111 --> 39:11.116
for a couple of seasons
after I got home from the war.

39:13.484 --> 39:14.656
Left field.

39:16.887 --> 39:20.733
I barely made enough to put
food on the table at home.

39:22.293 --> 39:23.465
But you loved it.

39:28.065 --> 39:29.169
I did.

39:33.104 --> 39:37.314
I wonder if you miss
the things you love after you die.

39:49.587 --> 39:51.589
Are you from Los Angeles, Mr. Leland?

39:52.490 --> 39:55.027
Nobody's from Los Angeles.

39:55.993 --> 39:57.700
Not even the ones born here.

39:59.330 --> 40:01.810
Just a set of circumstances.

40:03.334 --> 40:04.472
Where are you from?

40:06.704 --> 40:08.445
- What?
- Mr. Leland.

40:08.506 --> 40:10.008
Where were you born?

40:12.843 --> 40:13.843
Oh.

40:14.678 --> 40:15.884
Um.

40:17.815 --> 40:19.817
West Frankfort, Illinois.

40:20.651 --> 40:21.651
Oh.

40:21.886 --> 40:25.891
March 14, 1925.

40:26.991 --> 40:32.236
My mother gave birth to me
in the middle of a twister.

40:33.531 --> 40:35.636
Your mother must've been so afraid.

40:36.033 --> 40:37.205
Oh, she...

40:38.469 --> 40:42.713
prayed to God and begged him
not to take her baby,

40:43.641 --> 40:46.850
or to be merciful,
and take both of us together.

40:49.680 --> 40:51.387
You were a very lucky baby.

40:52.917 --> 40:55.898
Oh, it wasn't luck; it was prayer.

40:59.390 --> 41:03.668
I forgot, you don't wanna talk about God.

41:05.062 --> 41:07.201
I said I don't want
to talk about religion.

41:08.933 --> 41:12.779
Well, that's cutting it pretty thin,
don't you think?

41:14.038 --> 41:15.449
Doesn't matter what I think.

41:16.574 --> 41:18.850
Things are just how they are.

41:21.378 --> 41:22.378
Mm.

41:23.614 --> 41:27.255
Do you or do you not
believe in God, Marisol?

41:40.130 --> 41:42.736
What the hell does that mean?

41:43.901 --> 41:47.144
Faith and prayer are for the desperate,

41:47.738 --> 41:50.082
the lonely, and the afraid.

41:53.777 --> 41:56.155
Well, you're in America now.

41:58.215 --> 42:01.753
You're free to believe
whatever you want to believe.

42:04.221 --> 42:05.221
So...

42:06.056 --> 42:09.629
Do you or do you not believe in God?

42:12.263 --> 42:14.937
This is not something
I want to talk about today.

42:15.566 --> 42:16.567
If you don't mind.

42:17.468 --> 42:19.106
Well, I do mind.

42:20.004 --> 42:23.508
This is my last day on God's green earth,

42:23.607 --> 42:26.588
and it's exactly
what I want to talk about.

42:26.844 --> 42:28.482
It was only a dream!

42:29.146 --> 42:31.126
It wasn't a dream.

42:34.652 --> 42:37.963
Come sit down, Mr. Leland,
and eat your lunch.

42:40.157 --> 42:42.296
You don't want to believe me

42:43.327 --> 42:45.637
because you don't want to believe in God.

42:46.697 --> 42:48.677
Well, I believe in God.

42:49.667 --> 42:51.874
And I know what He's shown me.

42:53.871 --> 42:54.872
Speak English!

42:54.972 --> 42:56.280
You're talking crazy!

42:57.374 --> 42:58.876
There's nothing wrong with you!

42:59.443 --> 43:00.888
You're not going to die today!

43:01.211 --> 43:04.818
People with nothing wrong die every clay.

43:04.882 --> 43:06.987
That's right, they do.

43:08.185 --> 43:09.323
But not you.

43:09.954 --> 43:11.160
Not today.

43:11.789 --> 43:13.632
You should be grateful, Mr. Leland.

43:14.191 --> 43:15.727
Ninety-one years.

43:15.826 --> 43:16.964
I don't care.

43:17.027 --> 43:18.370
You should care!

43:20.197 --> 43:24.475
There are people alive in this world
who have nothing to live for.

43:26.370 --> 43:27.371
No home.

43:28.572 --> 43:29.573
No food.

43:31.075 --> 43:31.917
No hope.

43:32.009 --> 43:34.182
They can have my home.

43:34.678 --> 43:36.487
They can have my lunch.

43:37.481 --> 43:39.552
Hell, they can have my hope.

43:40.317 --> 43:44.993
When they carry me out of here,
they can just move right in.

43:45.255 --> 43:47.599
Come one, come all.

43:48.559 --> 43:51.403
Walter Leland is dead and gone.

43:52.496 --> 43:54.567
If you don't stop saying
the things you're saying,

43:54.665 --> 43:55.705
I'm afraid I'll have to...

43:55.733 --> 43:56.575
What?

43:56.667 --> 43:58.112
Mark in my file?

43:58.202 --> 44:00.239
I don't... Mark it in my file.

44:00.571 --> 44:03.950
I'm sick and tired of being a file.

44:04.508 --> 44:05.919
Please, Mr. Leland.

44:06.343 --> 44:07.343
Sit down.

44:07.945 --> 44:09.856
Eat your lunch. Take your medicine.

44:10.080 --> 44:11.024
You'll feel better.

44:11.081 --> 44:13.618
I don't want to feel better.

44:16.253 --> 44:17.698
Oh, Lord...

44:18.255 --> 44:19.962
Carry me home.

44:20.758 --> 44:22.897
Reach Your arms down here and...

44:23.961 --> 44:26.567
take me home to You and Mother.

44:28.198 --> 44:32.908
<i>In the sweet by and by,</i>

44:34.638 --> 44:39.644
<i>I will meet you on that beautiful shore</i>

44:40.144 --> 44:45.150
<i>- In the sweet by and by,
Stop it! Stop it!</i>

44:45.249 --> 44:48.059
<i>I will meet you on</i> that...

44:48.452 --> 44:51.331
- beautiful shore
- Stop it! He's not up there!

44:52.056 --> 44:53.399
He doesn't hear you.

44:53.457 --> 44:54.959
God's not up there.

44:55.292 --> 44:56.464
God's not anywhere.

44:56.560 --> 44:58.267
How dare you say that.

44:59.463 --> 45:00.601
How dare you!

45:01.331 --> 45:03.937
He's here. He's there.

45:04.168 --> 45:07.342
And damn you for saying otherwise.

45:12.009 --> 45:14.080
I'm so tired of this.

45:15.012 --> 45:16.958
Who's going to clean up the mess you made?

45:18.348 --> 45:19.348
God?

45:20.284 --> 45:24.255
Because it's not my job!
- I don't care if it ever gets cleaned up!

45:24.955 --> 45:26.195
The hell With it!

45:29.927 --> 45:31.099
Where are you going?

45:34.465 --> 45:35.944
To lie down.

45:36.467 --> 45:38.037
And die, I suppose.

45:38.936 --> 45:39.936
Yes.

45:41.305 --> 45:45.151
For the last goddamn time, yes!

45:49.113 --> 45:50.854
Get out! Go!

45:51.682 --> 45:55.789
Get out of my house!
Go back where you belong!

47:41.391 --> 47:42.563
Mr. Leland?

48:33.944 --> 48:35.014
Sometimes...

48:36.680 --> 48:37.886
on sunny days...

48:39.316 --> 48:40.386
after a storm...

48:43.553 --> 48:45.794
my tia would take me for some helado.

48:47.824 --> 48:48.824
Ice cream.

48:51.194 --> 48:53.640
And I'd walk on the beach
to watch the waves.

48:56.700 --> 48:59.476
She would point out
over the ocean and say...

49:16.320 --> 49:17.822
"America's that way...

49:19.022 --> 49:20.558
just over the horizon."

49:23.560 --> 49:25.904
She dreamed about going to America.

49:30.267 --> 49:31.769
"But how," she would say.

49:33.370 --> 49:37.250
"Only <i>Papa' Jesus</i> can walk upon the water."

49:40.110 --> 49:41.111
Besides...

49:42.713 --> 49:45.353
everyone she loved or buried...

49:46.616 --> 49:47.720
was in Cuba.

49:55.058 --> 49:57.561
"All my roses are in Cuba."

50:00.030 --> 50:01.976
My tia loved Cuba,

50:03.433 --> 50:05.606
but hated the country it had become.

50:08.105 --> 50:09.277
I told her.

50:10.741 --> 50:11.742
Someday...

50:14.077 --> 50:16.318
I would be her rose in America.

50:22.285 --> 50:26.290
I prayed many nights for the courage
to make the crossing.

50:28.492 --> 50:29.493
And one day...

50:33.964 --> 50:34.965
God said...

50:37.234 --> 50:40.681
"Si, Marisol, you may cross.

50:42.606 --> 50:47.646
If you have faith enough,
you may walk upon the water."

50:51.481 --> 50:53.119
Twelve dreamers...

50:54.951 --> 50:57.830
left Cuba on a tiny boat one night.

50:59.523 --> 51:00.593
By morning...

51:02.859 --> 51:06.102
all but four were lost.

51:09.266 --> 51:12.042
My precious little hijito, Mateo Amanda...

51:14.638 --> 51:16.379
his body was never found.

51:20.310 --> 51:23.223
He would have been 13 years old today.

51:28.518 --> 51:30.464
So, you see, Mr. Leland,

51:33.723 --> 51:35.327
you cannot die today.

51:40.330 --> 51:42.207
It's my son's birthday.

52:09.759 --> 52:11.204
Leave them on.

52:13.597 --> 52:15.076
I want them on.

52:20.170 --> 52:21.170
Okay-

54:33.136 --> 54:34.206
Yolanda!

54:34.738 --> 54:35.739
Mateo!

54:37.974 --> 54:39.044
Yolanda!

54:41.645 --> 54:42.988
It's Mr. Leland.

54:43.880 --> 54:44.880
Yolanda.

54:46.049 --> 54:47.926
- Mr. Leland.
- Yolanda!

54:48.018 --> 54:51.192
No, it's me, Marisol. What's wrong?

54:51.254 --> 54:53.530
It's dark. Dark!

54:53.823 --> 54:56.064
I closed the curtains so you could sleep.

54:56.393 --> 54:57.428
That's all.

54:57.827 --> 54:58.931
It's dark.

55:01.431 --> 55:03.707
See? It's still daytime.

55:09.372 --> 55:10.749
I was afraid.

55:15.345 --> 55:16.881
You don't have to be.

55:17.247 --> 55:21.127
I made such a mess of everything.

55:21.551 --> 55:23.189
It's already cleaned up.

55:25.755 --> 55:28.793
Oh. Marisol.

55:29.693 --> 55:32.902
Oh. Oh.

55:34.964 --> 55:38.741
I shouldn't have talked to you
the way I did. I'm...

55:39.536 --> 55:40.981
I'm sorry.

55:42.405 --> 55:44.976
I think we're both just
having a challenging day.

55:46.710 --> 55:50.055
So, why don't we just agree
to make the best of what's left of it?

55:52.282 --> 55:54.125
Deal, Mr. Leland?

55:55.318 --> 55:56.922
Call me "Walter."

55:57.787 --> 55:59.892
I would like that, if you did.

56:01.658 --> 56:03.069
<i>Mucho gusto, Walter.</i>

56:22.245 --> 56:24.247
- Mm-hmm.
- Do you like it?

56:24.314 --> 56:27.261
Oh, boy. Yeah, that's good.

56:28.651 --> 56:29.651
It's good.

56:30.987 --> 56:33.661
Never had Cuban food before.

56:34.824 --> 56:36.098
Well, now you have.

56:36.159 --> 56:38.833
Yes, I have.

56:46.803 --> 56:50.012
It's a terrible shame
about your son, Marisol.

56:51.808 --> 56:54.550
It must've been hard, losing him.

56:59.549 --> 57:00.994
It was much more than "hard."

57:31.981 --> 57:34.018
The little boy in the picture with you...

57:35.552 --> 57:36.552
He's your son?

57:40.890 --> 57:42.995
He was... He was my son, yes.

57:44.060 --> 57:46.062
You son was your son?

57:49.699 --> 57:53.272
Lost him and his mother to a stranger.

57:56.072 --> 57:58.279
His mother was your wife?

58:00.176 --> 58:01.177
Ruth.

58:02.078 --> 58:06.959
We married July 4th, 1946.

58:08.117 --> 58:13.726
Bobby was around five years old
when she'd had enough.

58:14.591 --> 58:15.695
Enough of what?

58:17.260 --> 58:18.261
Me.

58:18.928 --> 58:20.737
And what came with me.

58:23.733 --> 58:27.909
Three months after the divorce,
she remarried.

58:29.739 --> 58:34.745
A traveling salesman, of all people,
named "Johnson."

58:37.747 --> 58:38.747
It's funny.

58:39.582 --> 58:40.582
What?

58:40.984 --> 58:44.989
Oh, I can't remember his first name.

58:47.423 --> 58:50.597
Anyway, the three of them
moved to Cincinnati...

58:51.561 --> 58:55.099
to, "Make a new life
for themselves," she said.

58:56.633 --> 59:01.309
It wasn't too long before
the adoption papers came.

59:01.938 --> 59:03.349
Certified mail.

59:05.608 --> 59:07.417
I got good and mad.

59:08.444 --> 59:10.117
And I got good and drunk.

59:11.681 --> 59:14.321
Then I signed away my son.

59:17.020 --> 59:18.124
That was...

59:19.088 --> 59:21.534
in the spring of '54.

59:23.293 --> 59:29.266
By then, the best crop of bush leaguers
were being called up to the Majors.

59:31.267 --> 59:33.838
I was never going to get that call.

59:35.438 --> 59:38.351
I couldn't hit the long ball.

59:41.611 --> 59:44.615
Piece of German shrapnel
made sure of that.

59:47.116 --> 59:48.459
All I had left...

59:49.385 --> 59:53.492
was a bad case of
feeling sorry for myself.

59:54.190 --> 59:58.036
I woke up one morning
behind the wheel of my Buick.

59:59.162 --> 01:00:03.167
Upside down, in a ditch,
halfway to Cincinnati.

01:00:03.900 --> 01:00:05.846
Not a scratch on me.

01:00:09.238 --> 01:00:12.845
It was then that I heard it, so clear

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:16.015
it was like God whispering in my ear.

01:00:17.046 --> 01:00:18.491
"Walter Leland...

01:00:19.983 --> 01:00:24.523
Go be better at something else,
somewhere else."

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:28.064
I put down the bottle.

01:00:29.392 --> 01:00:30.928
I picked up the Bible.

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:35.500
And I headed West and never looked back.

01:00:36.566 --> 01:00:38.068
Why Los Angeles?

01:00:40.603 --> 01:00:46.212
Oh, I thought I'd get a high-paying job
in the defense industry.

01:00:46.876 --> 01:00:49.755
Buy a home facing the beach...

01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:54.856
where I could watch the sunset
on my front porch.

01:00:58.688 --> 01:01:04.695
I wound up behind a wheel
driving around in circles for a living.

01:01:06.929 --> 01:01:11.639
Then I bought this house... on GI Bill.

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:14.541
And, uh...

01:01:16.539 --> 01:01:18.485
Well, that's about it.

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:22.385
Not much to my stow.

01:01:23.479 --> 01:01:25.390
You fought for people's freedom.

01:01:26.215 --> 01:01:27.785
People you didn't even know.

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:30.992
You were a brave man, Walter.

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:35.263
I was a 17-year-old high school dropout
who was afraid

01:01:35.324 --> 01:01:39.397
I would end up in the mine digging dirt
next to my father <i>,</i>

01:01:39.462 --> 01:01:42.409
who was 50 before he was 40!

01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:45.640
I'm not a hero.

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:50.681
And don't go pinning a medal on me
that I don't deserve and don't want.

01:01:51.808 --> 01:01:54.084
All the war heroes are dead.

01:01:57.313 --> 01:02:01.261
All I did was kill to try to survive.

01:02:02.285 --> 01:02:03.855
And fail at life.

01:02:04.787 --> 01:02:07.165
There's nothing heroic about that.

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:08.826
You were a soldier.

01:02:09.192 --> 01:02:11.866
I was a drunk, and a dreamer,

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:15.033
and a damn bad husband and father.

01:02:15.965 --> 01:02:18.809
You sacrificed being with
your son, Walter.

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:20.940
So he could have a better life.

01:02:22.171 --> 01:02:23.844
With another man.

01:02:24.207 --> 01:02:26.050
I think you're not giving yourself credit

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:28.383
for the many good things
you have done in your life.

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:33.650
If you have to give yourself credit
for something you've done,

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:37.562
then maybe what you've done
isn't worth anything to anyone else.

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:41.894
- Look at you.
- Me?

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:46.298
You go around helping people feel better.

01:02:46.629 --> 01:02:49.872
You don't go tooting
your horn about it, do you?

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:51.368
It's my job to help.

01:02:51.467 --> 01:02:52.468
No.

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:56.539
It's in your heart to do that.

01:02:57.406 --> 01:02:59.215
It's how God made you.

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:03.547
That's why you're studying to be a nurse.

01:03:03.646 --> 01:03:06.525
I'm studying to be a nurse
because I want to make more money.

01:03:06.582 --> 01:03:09.028
I don't believe that and neither do you.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.666
I never made a dime's worth of difference
in anyone's life but my own.

01:03:17.527 --> 01:03:21.236
But someone like you can make
all the difference in the world.

01:03:26.035 --> 01:03:29.608
"We never touch people so lightly
that we do not leave a trace."

01:03:32.008 --> 01:03:33.282
That's what Oprah says.

01:03:35.111 --> 01:03:36.419
Who is "Oprah"?

01:03:39.115 --> 01:03:40.115
A friend.

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:45.290
Well, you tell your friend, Oprah,
that you made a difference

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:48.130
in this old man's life on his last day.

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:56.968
Suddenly I'm thirsty.

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:01.439
It's the salt.

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:06.915
Oh, yeah, well...

01:04:08.945 --> 01:04:10.982
I wish I could've been
strong as your mother

01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:12.491
when she faced her storm.

01:04:14.383 --> 01:04:15.555
But God?

01:04:16.953 --> 01:04:17.953
God.

01:04:19.922 --> 01:04:22.163
He failed me during mine, Walter.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.165
- No.
- He did.

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:26.596
He wasn't there for me.

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:29.302
Not for me or for my Mateo.

01:04:29.599 --> 01:04:33.843
Don't say that. He's always there.
He's always with us.

01:04:35.805 --> 01:04:37.580
I begged Him for His help.

01:04:39.342 --> 01:04:40.685
But He wasn't with me.

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:42.982
And I let go.

01:04:44.847 --> 01:04:45.917
I was weak.

01:04:47.483 --> 01:04:48.791
I was afraid,

01:04:50.119 --> 01:04:51.189
And I let go.

01:04:53.522 --> 01:04:54.592
So, you see?

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:57.767
I'm not special.

01:04:59.662 --> 01:05:00.766
I'm all alone.

01:05:03.633 --> 01:05:06.546
Where's Mateo's father'?

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:10.206
Rafael.

01:05:12.775 --> 01:05:14.982
He's a pilot for the Cuban Air Force.

01:05:16.612 --> 01:05:20.890
He was going to defect
and join Mateo and me in Florida.

01:05:23.619 --> 01:05:25.326
We were going to be married...

01:05:26.155 --> 01:05:27.156
in America.

01:05:29.825 --> 01:05:34.001
I was going to be a wife
and a mother in America.

01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:38.401
We were going to be a family in America.

01:05:42.738 --> 01:05:45.048
But once Rafael got the word of Mateo...

01:05:47.310 --> 01:05:48.755
I never heard from him again.

01:05:50.046 --> 01:05:52.526
Oh, he should not have abandoned you.

01:05:53.149 --> 01:05:54.924
I wanted to abandon myself.

01:05:56.352 --> 01:05:57.387
But I couldn't.

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:02.403
So, I found my way
to Los Angeles to get lost.

01:06:03.559 --> 01:06:06.597
Can't run away from yourself or your past

01:06:06.696 --> 01:06:08.505
no matter how hard you try,

01:06:08.564 --> 01:06:11.738
how far you go, how long you live.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:15.270
I know.

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:20.848
I live in California,
and I never go to the beach.

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:23.748
It was the same in Florida.

01:06:25.281 --> 01:06:28.387
Never near that awful water and waves.

01:06:29.618 --> 01:06:32.724
I'm afraid I would see
Mateo's body wash onto the shore.

01:06:36.459 --> 01:06:39.406
It's what I see most nights
when I close my eyes.

01:06:39.462 --> 01:06:42.204
Well, that's a dream. It's not real.

01:06:42.264 --> 01:06:44.540
What happened to me
was not a dream, Walter.

01:06:46.102 --> 01:06:47.445
Mateo is gone.

01:06:49.105 --> 01:06:51.244
My son is out in the ocean.

01:06:52.441 --> 01:06:53.441
Dead.

01:06:55.444 --> 01:06:56.616
And I am still here.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:00.590
You're supposed to be here, Marisol.

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:03.758
And so are you, Walter.

01:07:04.787 --> 01:07:07.165
Today. Tomorrow.

01:07:07.256 --> 01:07:09.600
And for however many more days to come.

01:07:10.092 --> 01:07:12.163
I know you want that to be true...

01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:16.972
but there are no days for me after today.

01:07:18.801 --> 01:07:21.407
Why, Walter'? why?

01:07:22.671 --> 01:07:23.979
Because you are sick?

01:07:24.940 --> 01:07:27.113
No. You are not sick.

01:07:27.643 --> 01:07:31.113
You have decided to be a foolish old man
who's tired of living.

01:07:32.815 --> 01:07:34.624
Well, life is precious, Walter.

01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:37.025
Life is a gift...

01:07:38.421 --> 01:07:40.162
given to you by your mother.

01:07:41.323 --> 01:07:42.927
My mother carried me.

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:45.096
God gave me life.

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:47.967
Then why are you in such a hurry
to give it back?

01:07:48.931 --> 01:07:51.639
Because I'm old, Marisol.

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:57.516
I'm old, and I'm tired,
and I'm afraid of living...

01:07:58.107 --> 01:07:59.643
waiting to die.

01:08:00.443 --> 01:08:03.890
God knows. That's why
He's showing me mercy.

01:08:04.547 --> 01:08:05.890
Bringing me home.

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:08.557
I have faith.

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:10.187
Faith.

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:11.687
<i>Shut away.</i>

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:13.388
All alone.

01:08:14.056 --> 01:08:16.832
Day after clay, year after year,

01:08:17.158 --> 01:08:20.231
listening to baseball games
on an old, broken radio?

01:08:21.363 --> 01:08:23.001
Waiting for it all to end?

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:26.073
What kind Of faith is that?

01:08:26.502 --> 01:08:29.415
How I chose to live my last years

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:33.009
is between me and Him.

01:08:37.011 --> 01:08:40.926
He'll judge my labors and deeds
soon enough.

01:08:48.924 --> 01:08:53.372
How could you let all these years pass
and not ever try to see your son again?

01:08:56.198 --> 01:08:57.676
How, Walter'?

01:08:58.600 --> 01:08:59.944
I wrote him a letter.

01:09:01.002 --> 01:09:02.175
Did he write back?

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:05.947
Let me be about it.

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:07.683
Did he, Walter?

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:09.613
Did Bobby answer the letter?

01:09:11.447 --> 01:09:12.790
I never mailed it.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:16.184
<i>Why?</i>

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:19.798
I never found the courage.

01:09:27.095 --> 01:09:28.598
You know what I think, Walter'?

01:09:30.131 --> 01:09:32.738
I think today is a good day
to find courage.

01:09:34.403 --> 01:09:36.404
I don't even know where he lives...

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:39.781
or even if he's alive.

01:09:41.609 --> 01:09:44.557
You'd feel it in your heart
if your son wasn't alive.

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:48.790
What is Bobby's full name?

01:09:50.719 --> 01:09:52.220
What does it matter'?

01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:53.453
Tell me.

01:09:58.060 --> 01:09:59.630
Robert Everett.

01:10:01.497 --> 01:10:02.669
Johnson.

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:06.941
We used to call him "Bobby."

01:10:09.305 --> 01:10:10.579
What is his birthday?

01:10:12.007 --> 01:10:14.851
19 May, 1948.

01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:21.521
Oh, he'd be 67 now.

01:10:23.352 --> 01:10:24.797
<i>Sixty-seven .</i>

01:10:27.423 --> 01:10:28.925
Oh, my God.

01:10:30.793 --> 01:10:32.033
Let's find him, Walter.

01:10:33.028 --> 01:10:34.371
Let's find Bobby.

01:10:36.632 --> 01:10:39.010
Why? To say, "Goodbye"?

01:10:40.669 --> 01:10:42.046
To say, "Hello."

01:10:43.505 --> 01:10:48.352
We wouldn't recognize one another
if you sat us face-to-face.

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:04.827
Walter'?

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:20.881
Hello. Leland residence.

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:24.513
Hello?

01:11:26.415 --> 01:11:27.416
Are you there?

01:11:27.650 --> 01:11:29.254
He's there.

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:31.020
It's Johnny Williams.

01:11:31.086 --> 01:11:35.364
Just tell him to hold on,
and bring a phone over here.

01:11:35.424 --> 01:11:37.233
Okay. Just a moment, please.

01:11:38.994 --> 01:11:41.668
The card's long enough.
Just bring it over.

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:45.177
It's all right. It's long enough.

01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:47.605
Yeah.

01:11:48.737 --> 01:11:49.738
All right.

01:11:50.506 --> 01:11:51.507
Yep.

01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:58.958
Hello, Johnny! I almost forgot
what Wednesday it was.

01:12:01.116 --> 01:12:02.891
How you doing, Johnny?

01:12:03.585 --> 01:12:06.589
You're breathing pretty strong here today.

01:12:08.691 --> 01:12:10.693
Yeah. Yolanda...

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:14.803
She couldn't come today. She's home sick.

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:17.638
That was Marisol.

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:21.105
Yeah, she likes baseball.

01:12:22.571 --> 01:12:24.141
You catch the ball game?

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:29.218
Yeah, the Dodgers pulled that one
out of their backside, didn't they?

01:12:30.112 --> 01:12:32.285
Going to have trouble making the series...

01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:35.226
with the way they're playing.

01:12:37.219 --> 01:12:39.722
Listen, Johnny. I'm glad you called.

01:12:42.958 --> 01:12:45.404
I need to say "Goodbye" to you, Johnny.

01:12:45.461 --> 01:12:48.067
I've been called up the front office.

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:52.111
The Lord's bringing me home today, Johnny.

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:54.678
That's right.

01:12:54.770 --> 01:12:58.684
I want you to know it's been
real nice knowing you.

01:12:59.108 --> 01:13:02.749
You've been a good friend
for all these years.

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:05.789
I didn't have many.

01:13:06.815 --> 01:13:08.294
I thank you for that.

01:13:10.252 --> 01:13:13.495
Good Lord willing, we'll see each other
on the other side.

01:13:13.789 --> 01:13:16.861
It'll be good to hear your voice again.

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:20.335
All right, Johnny.

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:23.109
I'm going to let you go.

01:13:23.999 --> 01:13:25.000
Um...

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:28.339
You go ahead and hang up first.

01:13:29.605 --> 01:13:34.145
Johnny, take care of yourself
'til I see you again.

01:13:35.711 --> 01:13:37.054
Goodbye, Johnny.

01:14:01.804 --> 01:14:03.715
Johnny can't talk.

01:14:03.806 --> 01:14:08.812
Cancer took his vocal cords
and most of his windpipe.

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:12.157
He hasn't spoken for ten years.

01:14:12.815 --> 01:14:13.816
Not a word.

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:17.888
How awful.

01:14:18.187 --> 01:14:22.226
Oh, don't feel sorry for Johnny.
He doesn't feel sorry for himself.

01:14:25.694 --> 01:14:27.605
He had a pretty good run of it.

01:14:28.764 --> 01:14:31.904
It's just not waning down so well.

01:14:33.535 --> 01:14:35.208
You're a good friend, Walter.

01:14:36.605 --> 01:14:40.348
Saying "Goodbye" to him wasn't as hard
as I thought it was going to be.

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:48.084
Let me help you find your son, Walter.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:52.699
I don't have a son.

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:56.064
<i>Watch me, Daddy.</i>

01:14:56.758 --> 01:14:58.032
<i>Daddy, watch me.</i>

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:06.435
If He's going to take me...

01:15:07.436 --> 01:15:09.575
<i>news as good a time as any.</i>

01:15:11.573 --> 01:15:14.110
I trust in You, oh Lord, I say.

01:15:15.310 --> 01:15:16.755
You are my God.

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:21.323
My times are in Your hands.

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:22.989
Walter.

01:15:58.353 --> 01:15:59.354
<i>Walter.</i>

01:16:01.290 --> 01:16:02.462
Walter, wake up.

01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:06.261
I found him.

01:16:07.329 --> 01:16:08.501
I found Bobby.

01:16:10.332 --> 01:16:12.471
You found Bobby? Where?

01:16:13.435 --> 01:16:14.436
Here.

01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:17.279
You had no right.

01:16:20.776 --> 01:16:21.777
Look

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:27.015
Oh, that's...

01:16:29.818 --> 01:16:31.695
That's Bobby.

01:16:33.388 --> 01:16:34.389
My boy.

01:16:35.324 --> 01:16:36.359
Bobby.

01:16:37.492 --> 01:16:38.664
My Son!

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:41.564
And you have grandchildren.

01:16:42.364 --> 01:16:44.037
And great-grandchildren, too.

01:16:45.467 --> 01:16:46.467
Do you see them?

01:16:48.036 --> 01:16:49.037
Look at them.

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:52.209
Look at them; all of them.

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:54.814
You have a beautiful family, Walter.

01:16:54.876 --> 01:16:57.049
Oh, they are beautiful.

01:16:57.512 --> 01:16:59.321
Every last one of them.

01:17:01.683 --> 01:17:03.390
They don't even know my name.

01:17:04.519 --> 01:17:06.157
Yes, then do. Mira.

01:17:06.989 --> 01:17:07.990
Oh!

01:17:08.323 --> 01:17:09.825
Here's your grandson.

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:12.032
Walter Johnson.

01:17:12.728 --> 01:17:14.264
And you have great-grandchildren.

01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:16.600
Here's a boy.

01:17:16.865 --> 01:17:18.037
Leland Johnson.

01:17:19.067 --> 01:17:20.410
You're not forgotten, Walter.

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:21.344
Oh!

01:17:21.403 --> 01:17:23.212
You're alive in this family.

01:17:23.271 --> 01:17:24.909
It's a little girl, here.

01:17:25.407 --> 01:17:26.408
Ruth.

01:17:26.775 --> 01:17:29.051
Named after her great-grandmother.

01:17:29.411 --> 01:17:30.754
Oh, thank you.

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:32.791
Thank you. Thank you.

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:39.622
I wonder...

01:17:40.288 --> 01:17:44.293
if he ever tried to find me,
and I wasn't there?

01:17:45.961 --> 01:17:47.440
Reach out to him, Walter.

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:50.432
How?

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:52.377
There's no time.

01:17:53.301 --> 01:17:55.247
We can send him a message
over the Internet.

01:17:55.303 --> 01:17:57.283
<i>Oh, no, no.</i>

01:17:58.273 --> 01:18:00.913
Bobby's lived a life without me.

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:04.383
Best we leave things as they are.

01:18:06.715 --> 01:18:09.662
Don't you want your family to know
more than just your name?

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:12.564
That you exist?

01:18:13.455 --> 01:18:15.128
At least know that you care?

01:18:19.594 --> 01:18:20.594
Oh.

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:27.102
No need now to open old wounds.

01:18:30.806 --> 01:18:31.807
You've done...

01:18:32.808 --> 01:18:35.948
a good thing, here. A good thing.

01:18:37.446 --> 01:18:41.656
And it looks as though
Bobby's had a good life.

01:18:42.417 --> 01:18:44.328
At least now I can leave...

01:18:45.921 --> 01:18:49.266
in peace without that one being on me.

01:18:50.192 --> 01:18:51.694
You're not going anywhere.

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:55.997
You will be right here when Yolanda or I
come through that door tomorrow morning.

01:18:56.098 --> 01:18:57.304
I'm not wrong.

01:18:58.967 --> 01:19:00.139
It's happening.

01:19:00.969 --> 01:19:01.970
Today.

01:19:02.370 --> 01:19:04.145
If you really believe that, Walter,

01:19:04.206 --> 01:19:06.880
then that's ever more reason
to contact your son.

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:12.184
Don't you want him to know
that you never stopped thinking about him?

01:19:14.015 --> 01:19:16.188
That you never stopped loving him?

01:19:21.356 --> 01:19:23.461
I wouldn't know what to say to him.

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:27.000
Say what's in your heart.

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:29.235
That will be enough.

01:19:34.336 --> 01:19:36.179
That he didn't forget?

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:38.974
That he remembered?

01:19:41.009 --> 01:19:42.420
That's enough for me.

01:19:43.845 --> 01:19:46.086
You are being selfish, Walter Leland.

01:19:47.415 --> 01:19:49.258
If you can't do it for yourself...

01:19:51.419 --> 01:19:53.262
then do it for your son.

01:19:58.693 --> 01:20:01.435
I'm tired, Marisol.

01:20:06.201 --> 01:20:07.703
I'm tired, too, Walter.

01:21:17.405 --> 01:21:18.405
See this?

01:21:21.743 --> 01:21:24.622
This is all I have left of my son, Walter.

01:21:26.248 --> 01:21:28.455
If I could reach out to my Mateo,

01:21:28.783 --> 01:21:30.626
could speak to him somehow...

01:21:31.319 --> 01:21:33.162
I would wish him happy birthday

01:21:33.488 --> 01:21:37.493
and beg him to forgive me for not being
brave enough for the both of us.

01:21:37.993 --> 01:21:40.166
If I believed in such things,

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:43.939
if I knew my Mateo was safe
and happy in heaven

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:46.878
walking on a sunny beach,
holding hands with my tia,

01:21:46.968 --> 01:21:48.038
eating ice cream,

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:49.840
I would tell him:

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:52.683
"Your Mamita loves you,

01:21:52.774 --> 01:21:55.015
and I'll see you again someday."

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:58.486
Even if he could say nothing back.

01:21:59.347 --> 01:22:03.693
I would shout my love and shout it,
and shout it, and shout it!

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:06.230
Until my voice was raw

01:22:06.321 --> 01:22:10.133
and there was nothing more left
than a whisper.

01:22:13.662 --> 01:22:17.166
Until God carried my message to my Mateo.

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:21.378
If I believed in such things!

01:23:38.380 --> 01:23:40.724
Our Father, Who art in heaven,

01:23:41.716 --> 01:23:44.663
hallowed be Thy name;
Thy kingdom come;

01:23:46.154 --> 01:23:50.625
Thy will be done
on earth as it is in heaven.

01:23:51.159 --> 01:23:53.503
Give us this day our daily bread;

01:23:54.095 --> 01:23:55.972
and forgive us our trespasses

01:23:56.064 --> 01:23:59.238
<i>as</i> we forgive those
who trespass against us;

01:24:01.069 --> 01:24:03.515
And lead us not into temptation,

01:24:04.739 --> 01:24:06.343
but deliver us from evil.

01:24:07.308 --> 01:24:12.417
For Thine is the kingdom,
and the power, and the glow

01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:15.484
forever and ever.

01:24:16.785 --> 01:24:17.820
Amen.

01:24:21.423 --> 01:24:22.424
Oh.

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:27.029
Lord, I know I must seem
the least of Your children.

01:24:27.929 --> 01:24:31.172
An old fool.

01:24:33.835 --> 01:24:36.645
But I have to ask You for a favor.

01:24:38.373 --> 01:24:41.718
Please, let her know
that he is safe with You.

01:24:44.179 --> 01:24:45.852
Grant her that mercy.

01:24:48.650 --> 01:24:51.824
I say in Jesus' name.

01:24:54.389 --> 01:24:55.389
Oh.

01:24:57.025 --> 01:25:00.063
One more favor.

01:25:03.164 --> 01:25:06.145
Give me the strength...

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:09.811
as You show me the light.

01:25:20.915 --> 01:25:22.019
All right?

01:25:25.186 --> 01:25:26.358
All right, then.

01:25:36.764 --> 01:25:38.107
All right, then.

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:18.984
I'll get your dinner ready.

01:26:19.941 --> 01:26:22.046
If you're not hungry,
you can have it later.

01:26:23.978 --> 01:26:26.049
I want to make a recording.

01:26:41.429 --> 01:26:42.635
Now you're ready.

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:55.677
Go ahead.

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:57.819
I'm already recording.

01:26:59.514 --> 01:27:01.824
Hello, Bobby. It's me.

01:27:03.618 --> 01:27:07.191
I don't know whether you ever
wanted to see me again.

01:27:08.156 --> 01:27:10.830
But I thought I would do this recording.

01:27:11.459 --> 01:27:13.268
Just so it's there.

01:27:14.529 --> 01:27:15.667
In case...

01:27:17.599 --> 01:27:20.671
you ever want to know
what became of me as I've...

01:27:21.869 --> 01:27:24.850
often wanted to know what became of you.

01:27:28.476 --> 01:27:29.978
I have a...

01:27:31.179 --> 01:27:32.681
a letter here

01:27:33.214 --> 01:27:35.490
that I have been holding

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:38.462
for quite a while.

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:41.288
I...

01:27:41.689 --> 01:27:44.067
I'd like to read it to you if...

01:27:45.526 --> 01:27:47.233
that's all right with you.

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:57.311
"Dear Bobby,

01:27:58.006 --> 01:27:59.383
It's your Daddy.

01:28:00.341 --> 01:28:05.256
I know it has been quite a while
since I last saw you.

01:28:06.180 --> 01:28:08.660
For that, I am truly sorry.

01:28:10.051 --> 01:28:12.691
I cannot tell you how many times

01:28:12.754 --> 01:28:16.600
I've climbed into my old Buick
to come and see you.

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:22.103
But each time, after 100 miles or so,

01:28:22.597 --> 01:28:26.409
I remembered why you
and your mother needed to leave,

01:28:27.435 --> 01:28:30.416
and I'd turn back around and head home

01:28:31.072 --> 01:28:33.518
thinking it was probably best

01:28:33.908 --> 01:28:36.252
not to keep pushing myself

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:40.215
into your life."

01:28:42.617 --> 01:28:47.566
"But Son, I want you to know
that I pray to God every night

01:28:48.089 --> 01:28:52.697
for your forgiveness
and for your health and happiness.

01:28:54.962 --> 01:28:58.307
I moved to California some time ago

01:28:59.133 --> 01:29:01.409
and am doing my best

01:29:02.136 --> 01:29:05.413
to make a life for myself out here.

01:29:06.974 --> 01:29:12.117
I hope you and your mother
have a good life in Cincinnati

01:29:12.914 --> 01:29:15.986
and that Mr. Johnson is treating you well.

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:23.663
I never meant to make it so that
we wouldn't be together, Bobby.

01:29:24.625 --> 01:29:27.629
I failed us all. I know that.

01:29:28.162 --> 01:29:31.109
And I know it's too late to fix things.

01:29:31.966 --> 01:29:34.003
But I want you to know, Son,

01:29:34.635 --> 01:29:39.812
that there's not a day that goes by
that I don't think of you.

01:29:41.609 --> 01:29:45.921
I miss you more than
I know how to ever say

01:29:47.682 --> 01:29:49.525
so you would understand.

01:29:51.486 --> 01:29:52.794
Be a good boy

01:29:52.854 --> 01:29:58.861
and grow up straight and tall
into the man I had wanted to be

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:00.638
and should have been.

01:30:02.296 --> 01:30:03.673
Say your prayers.

01:30:03.965 --> 01:30:05.638
Take care of yourself.

01:30:07.101 --> 01:30:10.275
If you could find a moment
to write me a few...

01:30:11.639 --> 01:30:14.313
kind lines someday,

01:30:15.209 --> 01:30:17.815
I promise I will cherish them.

01:30:18.813 --> 01:30:21.316
Always. Your Daddy."

01:30:32.326 --> 01:30:33.669
Is that all right?

01:30:36.397 --> 01:30:37.569
Yes, Walter.

01:30:38.966 --> 01:30:40.138
That was perfect.

01:30:41.402 --> 01:30:43.712
Want me to play it back
so you can watch it?

01:30:45.406 --> 01:30:48.250
No. No, I don't want to see it.

01:30:49.043 --> 01:30:50.044
Okay-

01:30:52.713 --> 01:30:54.852
Do you want me to send it
to Bobby right now?

01:30:57.084 --> 01:30:58.563
When would he get it?

01:30:59.253 --> 01:31:00.253
Right away-

01:31:00.888 --> 01:31:02.060
Right away?

01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:03.491
Yes.

01:31:03.858 --> 01:31:04.858
Oh.

01:31:06.327 --> 01:31:07.328
No.

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:11.373
Don't send it until after I'm gone.

01:31:13.367 --> 01:31:14.402
Walter.

01:31:15.002 --> 01:31:18.916
I wrote that letter 53 years ago.

01:31:19.006 --> 01:31:21.384
It can wait a while longer.

01:31:24.245 --> 01:31:25.245
No.

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:29.850
I want you to send it after I'm gone.

01:31:30.184 --> 01:31:34.360
I want you to promise to do that.

01:31:34.889 --> 01:31:36.197
Do you promise?

01:31:38.759 --> 01:31:40.136
I promise, Walter.

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:50.478
Well, I guess that's just about it.

01:31:55.610 --> 01:31:56.690
What do you need?

01:31:57.278 --> 01:31:58.780
I need to get up.

01:32:18.165 --> 01:32:19.974
Won't be long now.

01:32:35.249 --> 01:32:37.593
<i>Daddy, Watch me! Watch me, Daddy!</i>

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:39.999
<i>I'm Watching you, Son.</i>

01:32:40.788 --> 01:32:41.960
<i>Watch What I can do.</i>

01:32:43.457 --> 01:32:45.835
<i>High fly ball into right field!</i>

01:32:45.927 --> 01:32:47.998
<i>She is... gone!</i>

01:33:05.947 --> 01:33:07.387
Be a good boy

01:33:08.015 --> 01:33:10.154
<i>and grow up straight and tall</i>

01:33:10.651 --> 01:33:14.827
<i>into the man I had wanted to be
and should have been.</i>

01:33:16.157 --> 01:33:17.157
<i>Say your...</i>

01:33:19.327 --> 01:33:21.739
<i>There's not a day that goes by</i>

01:33:21.829 --> 01:33:27.836
<i>that I don't think of you and miss you
more than I know how to ever say</i>

01:33:28.402 --> 01:33:30.348
<i>so you could understand.</i>

01:33:30.638 --> 01:33:33.244
You're not
breaking your promise, are you?

01:33:33.341 --> 01:33:37.812
<i>Grow up straight and tall
into the man I had wanted...</i>

01:33:37.878 --> 01:33:39.084
No, Walter.

01:33:39.647 --> 01:33:41.183
I'm not breaking my promise.

01:33:42.149 --> 01:33:43.492
<i>Say our prayers.</i>

01:33:44.385 --> 01:33:45.659
I was just...

01:33:47.054 --> 01:33:48.727
<i>If you could find a moment...</i>

01:33:51.092 --> 01:33:52.230
How was your nap?

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:54.871
Beautiful.

01:33:55.563 --> 01:33:56.563
Good.

01:34:13.447 --> 01:34:14.448
Here.

01:34:15.116 --> 01:34:17.118
I'd like you to have that.

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:26.800
That's very special, Walter.

01:34:26.894 --> 01:34:27.804
Mm-hmm.

01:34:27.895 --> 01:34:30.569
But I can't accept it.
We're not allowed to take things from...

01:34:30.631 --> 01:34:34.135
You're not taking anything.
I'm giving it to you.

01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:36.871
Please.

01:34:38.305 --> 01:34:39.978
I want you to have it.

01:34:53.487 --> 01:34:55.160
- Thank you, Walter.
- Mm-hmm.

01:34:56.957 --> 01:34:58.561
I'll cherish it always.

01:35:04.398 --> 01:35:05.968
Oh.

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:07.068
Oh.

01:35:17.478 --> 01:35:18.479
Thank you.

01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:34.973
You should have another child, Marisol.

01:35:36.697 --> 01:35:37.698
What?

01:35:38.666 --> 01:35:40.703
You're a beautiful, young woman.

01:35:42.203 --> 01:35:47.812
You need to stop holding on to the past
like there's no tomorrow.

01:35:49.176 --> 01:35:50.177
We're not...

01:35:51.212 --> 01:35:53.158
meant to live that way.

01:35:58.719 --> 01:36:03.293
I know that now. You helped me see it.

01:36:07.128 --> 01:36:09.699
Walter, I... I could...

01:36:09.797 --> 01:36:10.969
Listen to me.

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:14.372
You meet someone.

01:36:14.869 --> 01:36:19.409
You marry and you have a child.

01:36:20.541 --> 01:36:25.820
All that love that you are holding
for your Mateo.

01:36:26.647 --> 01:36:32.222
It's bottled up and spoiling in you
for no reason at all.

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:34.666
You were a good mother.

01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:38.898
You did all you could for your Mateo.

01:36:42.029 --> 01:36:43.702
But it's time for you to...

01:36:46.433 --> 01:36:48.037
forgive yourself...

01:36:49.270 --> 01:36:50.442
and move on.

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:58.849
I could never let go of Mateo.

01:36:58.913 --> 01:37:00.586
- Never again.
- Don't let go.

01:37:02.416 --> 01:37:05.522
Take him with you, but move on.

01:37:08.389 --> 01:37:12.064
You'll always be his mother;
that can never change.

01:37:12.927 --> 01:37:15.430
Give him a brother or a sister.

01:37:16.063 --> 01:37:17.133
Or both.

01:37:19.233 --> 01:37:21.736
Tell them about Mateo.

01:37:21.802 --> 01:37:24.408
Tell them all about him. How...

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:27.451
How he laughed.

01:37:27.875 --> 01:37:31.982
How he loved to walk
on the beach eating ice cream.

01:37:33.614 --> 01:37:37.221
Tell them how much you loved him.

01:37:37.585 --> 01:37:39.758
How much you'll always love him.

01:37:42.289 --> 01:37:43.495
Oh, yes.

01:37:45.059 --> 01:37:49.735
Tell them all there is to know
about their little brother, Mateo.

01:37:50.331 --> 01:37:52.675
How he's gone off to God's

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:56.171
and his spirit lives in the sea.

01:37:59.673 --> 01:38:01.744
Don't be afraid of life.

01:38:07.648 --> 01:38:08.854
Life ends.

01:38:10.351 --> 01:38:11.921
And life goes on.

01:38:32.773 --> 01:38:34.184
What time is it?

01:38:37.511 --> 01:38:39.513
It's almost time for your supper.

01:38:41.782 --> 01:38:43.819
I'll cut up that peach before I go.

01:38:46.053 --> 01:38:47.964
You can have it for dessert later,

01:38:49.490 --> 01:38:51.993
or you can have it tomorrow morning
with your breakfast.

01:38:54.461 --> 01:38:55.462
It'll keep.

01:38:59.667 --> 01:39:00.737
You were right.

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:04.042
About what?

01:39:08.409 --> 01:39:10.650
It is a beautiful day.

01:39:18.252 --> 01:39:23.361
I used to take Mateo to the same beach
where my tia used to take me...

01:39:24.358 --> 01:39:25.701
on days like today.

01:39:27.995 --> 01:39:29.235
Just the two of us.

01:39:31.198 --> 01:39:33.701
He took his first steps in the sand.

01:39:35.769 --> 01:39:38.443
His footprints were so tiny next to mine.

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:50.460
I wish I could've seen the sunset
from my front porch.

01:39:58.125 --> 01:39:59.866
Let's go to the beach, Walter.

01:40:02.463 --> 01:40:03.635
For your sunset.

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:07.972
I'll take you there.

01:40:28.155 --> 01:40:29.156
Walter'?
