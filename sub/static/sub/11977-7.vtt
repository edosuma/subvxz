<i>Previously on</i> Rogue...

00:08.108 --> 00:10.108
Just making sure.

00:10.110 --> 00:11.710
What the fuck is that?
What the fuck is this?

00:11.712 --> 00:13.345
You took a risk,
saying those drugs were yours.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.679
You don't believe me, do you?

00:14.681 --> 00:16.448
One of my waitresses just quit.

00:16.450 --> 00:17.883
Look, if you think
you can keep up,

00:17.885 --> 00:18.683
I'm willing to give you a shot.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.018
For real?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.219
Maybe what I'm hearing is true.

00:21.221 --> 00:22.320
Oh, yeah, what's that?

00:22.322 --> 00:24.356
<i>Corners are vulnerable.</i>

00:24.358 --> 00:26.191
<i>That you are vulnerable.</i>

00:26.193 --> 00:27.826
Ty's made me an offer.

00:27.828 --> 00:29.461
Ty can't move your product.

00:29.463 --> 00:31.863
Keep your crew out of
my territory.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.732
I'm gonna let my peoples be
wherever they need to be.

00:33.734 --> 00:35.400
- Who's up?
- The head of the snake.

00:38.571 --> 00:40.572
Good for you, Ty.

00:40.574 --> 00:42.173

I'm gonna tell you who you raised.
You raised a thief.

00:55.856 --> 00:57.622
Those Marines tried to stop me
and I killed them.

00:58.991 --> 01:01.026
And now all my friends
are dead because of it.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.727
I'd like to speak to
a US attorney please.

01:02.729 --> 01:05.096
So what's this all about?

01:05.098 --> 01:06.998
I'm First Lieutenant
Ethan Kelly.

_

02:03.289 --> 02:05.190
On August 7th, 2011,

02:05.192 --> 02:07.125
in the Pashtun Region
of Pakistan,

02:07.127 --> 02:09.961
I shot and killed
three US Marines.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.597
It was a covert mission under the
command of General Lance Howard.

02:12.599 --> 02:13.765
Stop.

02:13.767 --> 02:17.302
- God damn it.
- What?

02:17.304 --> 02:19.471
We can't lead
with General Howard.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.906
Five minutes ago, you wanted
me to lead with Howard,

02:20.908 --> 02:22.974
now you don't.
Which one do you want?

02:23.676 --> 02:24.642
I know.

02:26.579 --> 02:28.213
Only a crazy man walks into the

02:28.215 --> 02:30.081
US attorney's office
and confesses.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.517
We gotta tell the whole story
from A to Z.

02:32.519 --> 02:33.718
Gotta lure them in.

02:33.720 --> 02:35.520
All right. I'll lure them in.

02:35.522 --> 02:37.689
Yeah, like <i>Hansel and Gretel.</i>
<i>The witch.</i>

02:37.691 --> 02:39.724
She builds a big,
beautiful house.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.526
She fills it with little
sweets and then she lays out

02:41.528 --> 02:43.294
little bread crumbs and one
by one, they come in,

02:43.296 --> 02:45.096
and bam, you got 'em.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.398
In the story, the witch
gets thrown in the oven.

02:47.400 --> 02:48.700
Not in the original.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.268
In the original,
the witch eats the kids.

02:51.971 --> 02:53.905
Betsy! That's Sophie.

02:53.907 --> 02:55.206
- Got it.
- Sophie?

02:55.208 --> 02:56.908
I know you fucked her.

02:56.910 --> 02:57.942
I don't care you fucked her.

02:57.944 --> 02:59.919
She doesn't care
you fucked her.

03:00.980 --> 03:02.080
Sorry, I'm late.

03:02.082 --> 03:04.716
How're we doing?

03:04.718 --> 03:07.218
We're getting there, slowly.
But we're getting there.

03:07.220 --> 03:08.924
What are you stuck on?

03:09.121 --> 03:12.021
Story, story, story, story.

03:15.127 --> 03:18.596
Guilt. Contrition.

03:18.598 --> 03:20.565
"I can't live with myself."
You're the victim.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.300
Look, you're telling me
that I'm guilty.

03:22.302 --> 03:23.334
I'm telling them
that I'm guilty.

03:23.336 --> 03:24.636
We're on the same page.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.437
But you gotta do it right.

03:26.439 --> 03:28.006
You do this right, you walk out

03:28.008 --> 03:31.109
free and clear as long
as everyone plays their part.

03:31.111 --> 03:32.510
We're setting them up.
We're knocking them down.

03:32.512 --> 03:33.945
- Donna's in.
- Donna? Really?

03:33.947 --> 03:35.647
Yeah.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.182
"Hello, Donna.
I'm Ethan Kelly's lawyer.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.784
You're husband's not missing.
He's dead.

03:39.786 --> 03:41.760
Ethan killed them.
I'm here to pay you off."

03:42.121 --> 03:43.321
There's no way
it went down like that.

03:43.323 --> 03:45.356
Pretty close.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.091
You must miss Ray.
I understand that.

03:47.093 --> 03:50.538
Please don't.

03:51.997 --> 03:53.731
Being a single parent
must be very tough.

03:55.868 --> 03:57.035
You have no clue.

03:59.939 --> 04:00.738
I'm going to help.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.808
I'm going to help you.

04:03.810 --> 04:04.909
I'm going to help Connie.

04:06.212 --> 04:08.713
Connie?

04:08.715 --> 04:11.482
You got the short end, both of you.

04:11.484 --> 04:13.551
I understand that,
I'm not here to pat your hand

04:13.553 --> 04:14.586
and cry over tea.

04:16.654 --> 04:17.856
You should be getting benefits.

04:17.858 --> 04:18.690
I'm going to see to that.

04:20.726 --> 04:23.115
But I'm here to offer you more.

04:24.029 --> 04:25.230
Considerably more.

04:28.701 --> 04:29.801
Can we talk?

04:33.072 --> 04:34.272
Yeah.

04:35.875 --> 04:37.408
So, you're saying
that Donna's 100% in.

04:37.410 --> 04:39.043
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

04:39.045 --> 04:41.246
In the proverbial bag.

04:41.248 --> 04:43.748
Now, once the US attorneys

04:43.750 --> 04:46.150
are satisfied you're not
batshit crazy,

04:46.152 --> 04:48.586
they're gonna have
to check out your story.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.455
And they're gonna grill you.
They're gonna grill you hard.

04:51.657 --> 04:53.224
You play this right,

04:53.226 --> 04:55.326
and they're gonna start
to put it all together.

04:55.328 --> 04:57.328
They're gonna start to think
that it must've been

04:57.330 --> 04:59.397
Howard and Roberts who
conspired to steal that money.

05:00.733 --> 05:02.834
What if they don't?

05:02.836 --> 05:05.441
You play it right,
and they will.

05:07.106 --> 05:08.139
And if they don't?

05:09.208 --> 05:11.075
If they don't, they don't.

05:11.077 --> 05:12.777
- What are my odds?
- Pick 'em.

05:12.779 --> 05:14.145
But we're shaving points.

05:15.547 --> 05:17.415
Worst case,
10 to 15, manslaughter.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.083
Maybe, I plead it down.

05:20.719 --> 05:21.519
Your call.

05:23.122 --> 05:23.988
You can do this.

05:25.724 --> 05:26.824
We can do this.

05:30.296 --> 05:32.730
I admire you.
You know that?

05:32.732 --> 05:35.733
If I was in your shoes,
cornered, nowhere to go,

05:35.735 --> 05:37.335
I'd be chewing
on the barrel of a gun.

05:39.972 --> 05:41.339
Well, I haven't
thought about that yet.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.374
You should.

05:46.412 --> 05:47.378
- Should I?
- Yeah.

05:48.981 --> 05:51.649
Be riddled with guilt.
Be racked with guilt.

05:51.651 --> 05:53.484
I can't live with myself.

05:53.486 --> 05:54.786
You gotta say that. Say that.

05:56.055 --> 05:57.188
- I feel guilty.
- Say it again.

05:58.123 --> 05:59.724
I feel guilty.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.225
Goddamn it. You gotta act it.
You gotta feel it.

06:01.227 --> 06:03.161
Say it again!

06:03.163 --> 06:05.563
If you can't do it here, you won't be
able to pull it off in their offices.

06:05.565 --> 06:06.898
You gotta sell it,
under pressure.

06:06.900 --> 06:07.899
I feel fucking guilty.

06:10.235 --> 06:11.369
I feel guilty every day.

06:14.173 --> 06:15.206
That's good.

06:22.614 --> 06:23.381
That'll work.

06:30.422 --> 06:32.657
This whole story,
murder, cover-ups,

06:32.659 --> 06:34.425
suicide, the military...

06:34.427 --> 06:35.827
That's a story.

06:35.829 --> 06:37.495
It's a saga. It's epic.

06:37.497 --> 06:38.997
You'll have them eating
out of your hand.

06:38.999 --> 06:40.198
They'll follow you like ducks.

06:42.101 --> 06:44.168
So, okay, let's recap.
First, "Woe is me.

06:44.170 --> 06:46.037
I'm so ashamed."

06:46.039 --> 06:48.106
Then the facts, Jack Webb, just the facts.
And then?

06:48.108 --> 06:50.141
You shut the fuck up.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.042
You let them come to you.

06:51.810 --> 06:53.344
What about AJ?

06:53.346 --> 06:54.278
He's dead.
That's a fact.

06:55.314 --> 06:58.950
Point taken.
Selected facts.

06:58.952 --> 07:01.085
They'll find out about AJ soon
enough, and then they'll ask you.

07:01.787 --> 07:03.454
Bread crumbs.

07:03.456 --> 07:04.455
You're the witch.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.192
What about the money?

07:08.194 --> 07:09.093
<i>Was it still there?</i>

07:20.039 --> 07:21.839
Oh, it was there.

07:21.841 --> 07:22.874
I had it recovered
two days ago.

07:30.716 --> 07:33.084
We can place Roberts in both
San Francisco and Afghanistan.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.386
Right.

07:35.388 --> 07:36.854
Little bread crumbs.
Baby step 'em.

07:36.856 --> 07:39.390
Make 'em dig.

07:39.392 --> 07:42.093
Make 'em pry it out of you,
the reluctant warrior.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.928
They do their job,
they'll ask you.

07:43.930 --> 07:46.230
We just have to hope they bite.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.066
It's a big bluff.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.767
A big bluff, but a good one.

07:52.371 --> 07:53.971
We're going to the river
with a pair of trays.

07:58.744 --> 08:00.378
All right.
Fuck it.

08:00.380 --> 08:01.579
I'm in.

08:04.850 --> 08:06.451
Good. We're all in.

08:08.187 --> 08:10.922
<i>What about Roberts?</i>

08:10.924 --> 08:12.623
<i>They're gonna find a nice,
little surprise at his house.</i>

08:41.720 --> 08:43.488
<i>And then we wait.</i>

08:43.490 --> 08:46.457
- Wait for what?
- For the US attorneys to go up the ladder

08:46.459 --> 08:48.426
to their boss,
Cynthia Richmond.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.261
Mmm.
Why not go to her first?

08:50.263 --> 08:52.230
Because Cynthia'd smell
a rat so fast,

08:52.232 --> 08:53.397
you'd be done before you blink.

08:53.399 --> 08:55.500
She's smart, that bitch.

08:55.502 --> 08:58.369
She is smart,
but she's also ambitious.

09:00.139 --> 09:01.806
Let us thank God.

09:01.808 --> 09:03.441
And when she gets
a whiff of this,

09:03.443 --> 09:04.942
front-page scenario,

09:04.944 --> 09:06.744
quantum frog-leap
up the ladder,

09:06.746 --> 09:07.812
she can't resist.

09:07.814 --> 09:09.413
Okay. Okay.

09:12.151 --> 09:13.384
Let's go again.
Sit down.

09:22.961 --> 09:26.264
On August 7th, 2011,
in the Pashtun Region of Pakistan,

09:26.266 --> 09:28.166
I shot and killed
three US Marines.

09:47.754 --> 09:50.922
- What the fuck?
- You're cheating on me, you whore.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.057
- Fuck you, Patrick.
- What, you know this guy?

09:53.059 --> 09:55.593
- Take a walk, buddy.
- Hello, this is my car.

09:55.595 --> 09:58.563
Well, then maybe we can tow
your fucking car,

09:58.565 --> 10:01.833
and then we can explain to your
wife why we towed your fucking car.

10:01.835 --> 10:03.902
- Beat it.
- Son of a bitch.

10:04.236 --> 10:05.703
Come on.

10:09.241 --> 10:10.942
I'm looking
for a friend of mine.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.511
Ty Dennison.

10:13.513 --> 10:16.447
You crazy? Word gets out
I gave Ty to the police...

10:16.449 --> 10:19.684
Why don't you try using your ears for
a change, instead of your mouth.

10:19.886 --> 10:21.152
You're gonna find Ty for me.

10:22.754 --> 10:23.855
You just cost me 40 bucks.

10:24.990 --> 10:26.357
You raised your prices.

10:27.559 --> 10:29.560
Good for you. Find him.

10:37.970 --> 10:39.504
Give me a hand with this?

10:39.506 --> 10:41.005
Where's the bar back?

10:41.007 --> 10:43.608
Getting high, probably.

10:43.610 --> 10:45.042
- You did the fruit for me?
- Doing my part.

10:46.111 --> 10:49.013
Easy, Talia. Pace yourself.

10:49.015 --> 10:49.981
I need this to work.

10:51.350 --> 10:54.152
It'll work. You're fine.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.554
Oh, I'm more than fine, honey.

10:58.490 --> 10:59.590
I see that.

11:00.492 --> 11:02.627
Do you?

11:02.629 --> 11:04.529
Don't tease me like that.

11:04.531 --> 11:06.497
That'd be the perfect ending,
right?

11:06.499 --> 11:07.732
I get sued for
sexual harassment.

11:09.434 --> 11:11.435
I got a good lawyer.

11:11.437 --> 11:12.737
I don't wanna hear
about Marty Stein. Please.

11:14.806 --> 11:16.707
What you need
to be worried about?

11:16.709 --> 11:18.176
Your handsome,
white nose is clean.

11:49.474 --> 11:52.076
What kind of dumb motherfucker

11:52.078 --> 11:54.045
kills a whole man's family
and leaves the man alive?

11:54.047 --> 11:55.379
Marlon, I thought it was him.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.315
You thought. Here's a thought.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.282
Maybe you ain't
cut out for this, man.

11:58.984 --> 12:00.518
What?

12:00.520 --> 12:01.819
I killed my own blood for you.

12:01.821 --> 12:03.721
For me?

12:03.723 --> 12:05.620
You think this is personal?

12:06.758 --> 12:08.159
Look, I got all my people
out looking for Ty.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.427
All your people?

12:09.429 --> 12:11.229
You ain't got
no fucking people, man.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.030
I got the fucking people.

12:13.032 --> 12:15.032
You sell.

12:15.034 --> 12:17.068
- What about Ordonez?
- I said, "You sell."

12:17.070 --> 12:19.103
I'm gonna handle this.

12:19.105 --> 12:21.739
You think I'm gonna let you
negotiate with the cartel?

12:21.741 --> 12:23.975
You can't even sweep
a house properly, man.

12:26.245 --> 12:28.713
If I was you, I would
get the fuck out of my car.

12:28.715 --> 12:31.485
- Yo, I can do this.
- Get the fuck out of the car.

14:00.672 --> 14:03.708
Well, if it isn't
the coldest, deadliest,

14:03.710 --> 14:07.978
trigger-happy motherfucker
in all this great here Chi-Town.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.181
You're an asshole.

14:11.717 --> 14:13.484
When's Dinard coming in?

14:13.486 --> 14:15.486
CPD just cleared him.
In an hour.

14:15.488 --> 14:16.821
He have any connection
to the Crown building?

14:16.823 --> 14:19.490
Not that I can see.

14:19.492 --> 14:20.725
- Are those the notes from Guthrie?
- Yup.

14:20.727 --> 14:21.892
And it's a mess.

14:26.398 --> 14:29.367
- Who's Jackie Till?
- What?

14:29.369 --> 14:32.670
She's listed here as part-owner of the
Crown building.

14:32.672 --> 14:33.938
I don't know.
I'll get the address, check her out.

14:35.640 --> 14:37.605
Get that stuff I asked for?

14:43.582 --> 14:44.749
Welcome back.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.257
<i>So, how are you healing?</i>

14:53.259 --> 14:55.426
<i>Physically or emotionally?</i>

14:55.428 --> 14:57.661
<i>Right.</i>
<i>Right, this is your first time, um...</i>

14:57.663 --> 14:58.462
<i>Being shot at?</i>

14:59.097 --> 15:00.941
Killing someone.

15:01.366 --> 15:03.340
Both, actually.

15:04.403 --> 15:06.570
Well, we're sorry you had to go
through that, Mr. Dinard.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.940
- Any idea why?
- I'm sorry?

15:09.942 --> 15:12.243
Why you were in that situation?

15:12.245 --> 15:15.168
I'd say I have a pretty good
reason why, yeah.

15:19.085 --> 15:22.720
One of the many challenges of
being a black business owner

15:22.722 --> 15:25.177
is that you get people coming
out of the woodwork.

15:25.290 --> 15:27.100
Making demands.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.988
Demands?

15:29.928 --> 15:31.862
Are you saying
they were extorting you?

15:31.864 --> 15:34.585
I suppose they believe that
the police don't care.

15:35.367 --> 15:38.127
I can't say I altogether
disagree with that.

15:39.404 --> 15:41.539
Doesn't matter now.

15:41.541 --> 15:43.240
And I think they'll think
twice before coming back

15:43.242 --> 15:46.310
around my way,
thanks to Agent Deakins.

15:46.312 --> 15:49.601
Well, as I understand, it was a...
It was a joint venture.

15:49.636 --> 15:52.149
Uh, that was...

15:52.151 --> 15:54.718
Some pretty serious firepower
for a shakedown.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.288
I'd say I'm a long way
past a shakedown.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.257
I've been turning those boys away
for the last couple of months.

16:00.259 --> 16:01.959
<i>The store can't</i>
<i>support it anymore.</i>

16:01.961 --> 16:04.028
<i>I'm surprised</i>
<i>it took this long.</i>

16:05.130 --> 16:08.199
So did you recognize any of
the men who attacked you?

16:09.968 --> 16:14.805
Um, I mean, I wasn't really paying
attention to their faces in the moment.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.273
What about now?

16:17.008 --> 16:19.076
Do you recognize him?

16:20.345 --> 16:22.680
- Was he the third man?
- We believe so. Yeah.

16:22.682 --> 16:23.581
Hmm.

16:24.683 --> 16:26.784
His name's Ty Dennison.

16:26.786 --> 16:29.854
He was caught by security
cameras just before the attack.

16:30.222 --> 16:32.290
Has he ever been
around your store?

16:34.960 --> 16:38.029
No, I don't believe so.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.967
I find that hard to believe
considering the two of you

16:42.969 --> 16:45.036
stole a car together
when you were kids.

16:47.439 --> 16:50.508
The case was sealed, but I found
these floating around our system.

16:51.243 --> 16:53.311
Arrest notes,

16:53.313 --> 16:55.313
for Ty Dennison
and Marlon Dinard,

16:55.315 --> 16:57.782
dated September 3rd, 1994.

16:58.951 --> 17:00.418
Can you explain this?

17:03.822 --> 17:06.723
It's a part of my life
I really don't like to think about.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.392
So, you lied to us?

17:08.394 --> 17:09.993
No, I don't believe I did.

17:09.996 --> 17:11.061
<i>Well, I asked if you knew him.</i>

17:11.064 --> 17:12.896
No, you asked if he ever
came to the store.

17:12.898 --> 17:14.565
No, he did not.

17:14.567 --> 17:17.642
You acted like you didn't
recognize him.

17:17.935 --> 17:22.006
The man that shot at us,
that's not the same Ty I knew.

17:22.008 --> 17:25.309
Grand theft auto,
evading police, resisting arrest,

17:25.310 --> 17:28.725
carrying a concealed weapon,
it sounds exactly like the Ty you knew.

17:29.581 --> 17:31.440
I'm sorry, I mean,

17:31.783 --> 17:33.924
I think people change.

17:48.128 --> 17:51.214
_

17:59.778 --> 18:01.278
I'd like to speak
to a US attorney, please.

18:01.280 --> 18:02.913
What's it regarding?

18:02.915 --> 18:05.402
I'd like to speak
to a US attorney.

18:09.354 --> 18:10.488
Please state your
name for the record.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.022
Ethan Kelly.

18:12.024 --> 18:13.757
Mr. Kelly, you've waived the
right to have council present.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.025
Is that correct?

18:15.027 --> 18:17.261
Correct.

18:17.263 --> 18:20.698
I'd just like to remind you that you may
stop at any time should you reconsider.

18:20.700 --> 18:21.932
- I understand.
- Please begin whenever you are ready.

18:23.702 --> 18:25.669
In 2011, I was in command
of a four-man unit,

18:25.671 --> 18:27.605
for a private security company

18:27.607 --> 18:31.442
by the name of Votan Security,
out of Afghanistan.

18:31.444 --> 18:35.713
I received an order to, uh, retrieve
a delivery of US government cash

18:35.715 --> 18:38.449
that had been hijacked
by Pakistani rebels.

18:38.451 --> 18:40.651
Um, it was a covert operation
due to the fact

18:40.653 --> 18:44.014
that we weren't supposed to be
in Pakistan at the time.

18:44.990 --> 18:46.690
During the mission,
shots were exchanged,

18:46.692 --> 18:48.359
and the rebels were killed.

18:48.361 --> 18:50.705
It was later that, uh...

18:51.563 --> 18:53.631
That I discovered
that they were, in fact, US Marines.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.883
And why are you
just coming forward now?

18:58.370 --> 18:59.603
Guilt.

19:10.215 --> 19:11.248
You watch that whole thing?

19:11.250 --> 19:13.751
Uh-huh.

19:13.753 --> 19:15.352
You still think he's just
some poor schmuck

19:15.354 --> 19:17.087
who got caught up in gang beef?

19:17.089 --> 19:18.756
It certainly seems
like he's hiding something.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.558
I dunno.
He seems kinda wholesome.

19:22.093 --> 19:24.028
I watched him unload
on those bangers.

19:24.030 --> 19:25.829
There's nothing
wholesome about it.

19:25.831 --> 19:28.766
All right?
No hesitation, no nothing.

19:28.768 --> 19:31.035
I'm telling you, that's a man who knows
what the fuck he's doing.

19:31.037 --> 19:32.836
Well, maybe it's the sweater
that's throwing me.

19:32.838 --> 19:34.104
It's a new breed of gangster,
that's for sure.

19:36.374 --> 19:39.539
Hey, those arrest notes,
they're supposed to be sealed, by the way.

19:39.945 --> 19:41.882
Well, you think
he's gonna report me?

19:43.415 --> 19:45.115
Bottom line,

19:45.117 --> 19:46.884
the leader of the
Indiana Breeds

19:46.886 --> 19:49.954
is not gonna waste his time
shaking down some chandelier store owner

19:49.956 --> 19:53.524
the day after his family
is murdered in cold blood.

19:53.526 --> 19:56.627
So, what do you wanna do?
CPD already cleared him in the shooting.

19:56.629 --> 19:58.696
- I think we gotta talk to the sister.
- I already talked to her.

19:58.698 --> 19:59.830
Then we need
to talk to her again.

20:01.299 --> 20:02.800
Clearly,
Dinard is very careful.

20:02.802 --> 20:05.369
His sister, not so much.

20:05.371 --> 20:07.838
If we leverage the counterfeit
charge, maybe we can flip her.

20:10.108 --> 20:12.176
All right, talk to Guthrie,
see what she can do.

20:12.911 --> 20:15.713
- Yo, D, you pull in Ty yet?
- Still looking.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.948
Cause if you're beating the shit
out of him in some dark corner

20:17.950 --> 20:19.149
and haven't told me about it...

20:19.151 --> 20:20.751
You get first crack, Deaks,
don't you worry.

20:20.753 --> 20:22.786
Damn straight I do.

20:22.788 --> 20:24.288
Hey. Hey, by the way, you need
to sit down with that shrink,

20:24.290 --> 20:25.789
so that they can
check off that box.

20:25.791 --> 20:28.892
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm serious, Deakins.

20:28.894 --> 20:31.362
This, right here,
is my therapy.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.600
Mount up, Patty.

20:36.602 --> 20:39.269
- Where are we going?
- We're going to see Talia.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.643
- How's it going out there?
- Dead.

20:45.645 --> 20:47.444
Well, maybe if you showed
a little more skin...

20:47.446 --> 20:50.514
I show any more skin,
it's gonna be a Health Code violation.

20:51.483 --> 20:53.617
I got a favor to ask.

20:53.619 --> 20:55.586
I told you,
I'm a happily married man.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.621
Hilarious.

20:57.623 --> 21:00.658
But seriously,
if it's okay with you,

21:00.660 --> 21:02.793
I would like to leave
a little early tonight.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.162
Why, you got a date?

21:05.164 --> 21:07.698
- Kinda.
- Now, I'm jealous.

21:07.700 --> 21:09.333
It's with my brother.

21:09.335 --> 21:11.802
And now,
I'm strangely turned on.

21:11.804 --> 21:15.272
Mmm. I always figured
inbreeding ran in your family.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.473
You were just asking
for a favor, right?

21:16.475 --> 21:17.675
Mmm.

21:17.677 --> 21:20.110
Yeah, that's fine, go.

21:20.112 --> 21:21.679
Nobody's leaving their house
in this shitty weather anyway.

21:21.681 --> 21:23.380
You're the best.

21:33.625 --> 21:36.560
- Miss Freeman?
- Yeah.

21:36.562 --> 21:39.396
- Agent Deakins, DEA. Can we have a word?
- I'm working.

21:39.398 --> 21:40.864
Your aunt said you would be.
This will just take a minute.

21:40.866 --> 21:43.033
You should be talking
to my lawyer.

21:43.035 --> 21:44.626
We're not here
to cause problems.

21:44.736 --> 21:46.403
Yeah, I bet.

21:46.405 --> 21:48.944
We know you're not with the
Kings, Ms. Freeman.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.508
Oh, yeah.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.577
- How you know that?
- Well, you're working here for one.

21:53.579 --> 21:55.379
We also know your brother
gave you that counterfeit money.

21:55.381 --> 21:56.880
You don't know shit.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.549
Our attorneys are willing
to do probation

21:58.551 --> 22:01.051
if you give us actionable
evidence against your brother.

22:01.053 --> 22:03.220
The fuck you trying to harass
Marlon for?

22:03.222 --> 22:05.489
He's just a small business owner.
Shit.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.024
There ain't a black man
safe in this city

22:07.026 --> 22:08.926
with you motherfuckers,
are there?

22:08.928 --> 22:10.661
Three years might look like
nothing from the outside,

22:10.663 --> 22:13.163
but trust me those days
move real slow,

22:13.165 --> 22:15.199
when you don't have a cute
bartender to flirt with.

22:15.201 --> 22:17.601
Like I said, you wanna talk,
talk to my lawyer.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.503
All right.
And you change your mind...

22:21.372 --> 22:22.239
give me a call.

22:25.310 --> 22:28.576
And don't think I'm not gonna talk to
my attorney about this little visit.

22:28.913 --> 22:30.786
This is harassment.

22:34.553 --> 22:36.546
When did you first realize
that they were Marines?

22:37.222 --> 22:39.256
Uh, upon inspecting the bodies.

22:39.258 --> 22:41.158
Why did you inspect
their bodies?

22:41.160 --> 22:44.094
- Excuse me? - Why didn't you just
retrieve your cargo and leave?

22:44.096 --> 22:45.963
Well, we just killed three men.

22:45.965 --> 22:48.766
- Dressed as Taliban, correct?
- Yes.

22:48.768 --> 22:51.068
Do soldiers routinely inspect the
bodies of the men they kill?

22:51.070 --> 22:52.770
Um, it depends on
the situation.

22:52.772 --> 22:54.508
Then, why this time?

22:54.940 --> 22:57.588
One of the men had blue eyes.

22:57.623 --> 22:59.310
I just had a feeling.

22:59.312 --> 23:02.579
Did you have this feeling
before the mission?

23:02.614 --> 23:04.281
No, no, no.

23:04.283 --> 23:07.052
Then when? During? After?

23:07.087 --> 23:08.221
Ten minutes ago?

23:08.256 --> 23:10.754
It was after.

23:10.756 --> 23:13.090
- Let's move on.
- Mr. Kelly, please take us through the events

23:13.092 --> 23:14.961
that directly followed
the shooting?

23:15.827 --> 23:18.329
Uh, after we retrieved
the money,

23:18.331 --> 23:21.274
I sat down with the
head of operations, AJ Baldwin.

23:24.836 --> 23:27.489
- Where's Jack?
- I don't know.

23:35.947 --> 23:39.497
- You wanna play?
- Oh, no.

23:41.319 --> 23:43.987
Actually, I got
a question for you.

23:43.989 --> 23:46.790
- Okay... - The night that
you and Jack were pulled over...

23:46.792 --> 23:48.525
Oh, yeah.

23:48.527 --> 23:51.662
Man, we were pulled over
for the dumbest reason, man.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.227
- Like, we wasn't speeding or nothing, man.
- Not that.

23:55.266 --> 23:57.634
- That wasn't my question.
- You should've seen him.

23:57.636 --> 23:59.403
And he actually kind of drives
like a woman, you know.

24:01.973 --> 24:04.323
You're not in trouble.
I just...

24:05.543 --> 24:07.177
I want to know
whose drugs those were.

24:07.179 --> 24:09.112
I know they wasn't mine.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.341
Look, I'm not DEA
Agent Deakins right now, okay?

24:13.318 --> 24:14.916
I promise.

24:16.521 --> 24:18.927
It's really, really important
you tell me the truth.

24:27.832 --> 24:29.485
Do you trust me?

24:30.335 --> 24:33.070
- What?
- I'm letting you stay in my home.

24:33.072 --> 24:36.006
We've been sharing the same
close quarters for a bit now.

24:36.008 --> 24:38.041
I mean, doesn't that buy me
some good faith?

24:38.043 --> 24:39.309
I guess you're not so bad
for a white lady.

24:39.311 --> 24:41.044
Good.

24:41.046 --> 24:43.374
So, roommate to roommate,

24:43.882 --> 24:46.321
- were they your drugs?
- No.

24:47.552 --> 24:48.986
Is that the honest truth?

24:48.988 --> 24:51.069
What other kind of truth
is there?

24:52.523 --> 24:54.826
- Whose were they?
- I don't know.

24:57.061 --> 24:58.549
Were they Jack's?

24:58.584 --> 25:01.531
No, man.

25:01.533 --> 25:04.501
I swear. The cops probably
planted it on him or something.

25:04.503 --> 25:06.617
He's not gonna get in trouble.

25:07.572 --> 25:08.639
I promise.

25:16.881 --> 25:18.081
All right.

25:22.287 --> 25:24.886
Play your game.

26:59.117 --> 27:00.784
I thought I taught you better.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.487
You taught me just fine, man.
Things have been handled.

27:03.489 --> 27:05.389
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

27:05.391 --> 27:07.190
A shootout just off of
Ashland Avenue,

27:07.192 --> 27:09.493
that's how you handle things?

27:09.495 --> 27:11.895
What if they went
inside the truck?

27:11.897 --> 27:15.198
Huh? What if they opened up
a crate and looked inside?

27:15.200 --> 27:16.833
Well, they didn't, did they?

27:16.835 --> 27:19.202
Not this time.

27:19.204 --> 27:20.537
Well, let's move on, man.

27:20.539 --> 27:22.706
Yeah, okay.
Let's move on.

27:22.708 --> 27:25.175
I don't think you quite understand
the class five fucking shitstorm

27:25.177 --> 27:27.377
that you have brought down
on yourself.

27:27.379 --> 27:29.846
Everything don't always work out
the way you want it to, Marty.

27:29.848 --> 27:31.081
You got to adapt, man.

27:31.083 --> 27:33.250
What the fuck are you doing?

27:33.252 --> 27:34.985
We're partners, Marlon.

27:34.987 --> 27:35.886
That's gotta mean
something to you!

27:35.888 --> 27:37.754
It...
It does, man.

27:37.756 --> 27:40.690
It does, really? Because it...

27:40.692 --> 27:43.226
Let me tell you something,
it certainly doesn't fuckin' feel that way.

27:43.228 --> 27:45.362
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry you feel like that, man.

27:45.364 --> 27:47.164
I don't hold back from you.

27:47.166 --> 27:49.525
- You don't hold back from me.
- You're right, look.

27:49.834 --> 27:51.568
I should have
spoke to you first.

27:51.570 --> 27:54.010
All right.
All right, then.

27:56.007 --> 27:59.810
Look, I ain't trying to make
no excuses or nothing,

27:59.812 --> 28:04.527
but Talia and I, we've been having
this thing, and I had to cut off.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.351
Haven't been the same,
the last couple of days.

28:07.353 --> 28:10.087
I don't know, maybe I was too hard
on her, you know?

28:10.089 --> 28:12.723
No. No.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.558
Better in the long run
for all our sakes.

28:14.560 --> 28:16.390
Yeah.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.663
Do me a favor,
and lay low for a little while.

28:19.665 --> 28:21.265
The feds are gonna
be up your ass for weeks.

28:21.267 --> 28:24.167
They already got a car parked
on the store right now, man.

28:24.169 --> 28:26.436
All right, well, let Jason,
that's the new guy's name?

28:26.438 --> 28:28.605
- Yeah.
- Let Jason run the day-to-day.

28:28.607 --> 28:30.440
That boy don't
have it in him, man.

28:30.442 --> 28:32.943
They said the same about you,
when you started.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.878
Now, shit is different,
and you know it, too, Marty.

28:34.880 --> 28:36.613
It's different because
you had me.

28:36.615 --> 28:38.749
- You made mistakes, too.
- Oh, is that how it was?

28:38.751 --> 28:40.450
Yeah, that's how it was.

28:40.452 --> 28:42.708
So do me a favor,
give the kid a chance, will you?

28:42.743 --> 28:44.447
Yeah, sure.

28:44.455 --> 28:46.212
Maybe.

28:46.457 --> 28:49.138
All right.
Now, get out of here.

28:49.260 --> 28:51.395
Do me a favor, will you?

28:51.397 --> 28:53.363
Keep yourself uninteresting,
you understand?

28:53.365 --> 28:54.981
Yeah, you're right.

28:55.300 --> 28:57.105
You're always right, Marty.

28:57.535 --> 28:59.369
I'm always right.

29:00.939 --> 29:03.226
Tell me something I don't know.

29:27.698 --> 29:29.572
Sorry for the drive.

29:30.868 --> 29:34.337
- There are federal officers
watching your store, Marlon. - Yeah.

29:34.339 --> 29:38.108
Perhaps a firefight in a quiet
neighborhood was not a good idea.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.921
Already been through that once
today, so if you don't mind...

29:42.280 --> 29:44.786
I've come up with a solution
to our issue.

29:44.982 --> 29:45.916
Have you?

29:48.119 --> 29:50.720
From now on, I'm gonna handle
the shipments personally.

29:50.722 --> 29:52.622
- Personally?
- Yeah.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.658
This is your solution?

29:54.660 --> 29:57.861
It was wrong of me to make
you deal with unfamiliars.

29:57.863 --> 29:59.663
This relationship
is too important,

29:59.665 --> 30:01.862
and I haven't been
treating it that way.

30:02.233 --> 30:04.628
And I promise
that won't happen again.

30:07.071 --> 30:10.307
I've spoken
to the bosses back home.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.143
They feel it's appropriate
for us to step away for a time.

30:13.145 --> 30:15.011
Wait, wait.

30:15.013 --> 30:17.047
I don't...
I don't understand.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.349
Too much upheaval,
even by your Chicago standards.

30:19.351 --> 30:22.352
Then why the fuck did you come out here
if the answer was no?

30:22.354 --> 30:25.088
Because this is
an important relationship,

30:25.090 --> 30:26.423
and I want to treat it
that way.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.158
Fuck that shit, man.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.094
In six months, Marlon,
we can reassess.

30:31.096 --> 30:33.330
Six months?

30:33.332 --> 30:35.031
Does it look like
I have six months?

30:35.033 --> 30:36.833
Surely you have a...

30:36.835 --> 30:38.268
rainy day fund, yes?

30:38.270 --> 30:40.670
You think this is Mexico, man?

30:40.672 --> 30:43.840
Got no fuckin' cartel money
around here.

30:43.842 --> 30:45.942
I need fuckin'
product right now!

30:45.944 --> 30:48.044
Then, perhaps it would
have been wise

30:48.046 --> 30:50.975
for you to stay off the radar
of the DEA.

31:10.668 --> 31:12.269
- Thank you for the coffee.
- Yeah.

31:15.106 --> 31:17.074
How often was a mission
designated covert?

31:17.076 --> 31:19.543
Uh, it wasn't common.
It wasn't uncommon.

31:19.545 --> 31:20.610
What does that mean?

31:20.612 --> 31:23.213
One in six, maybe seven.

31:23.215 --> 31:26.116
And AJ Baldwin
coordinated these?

31:26.118 --> 31:27.417
<i>Uh, there was a guy before him,</i>
<i>Lieutenant Svoboda,</i>

31:27.419 --> 31:29.953
<i>but AJ took over</i>
<i>about two years into my stint.</i>

31:29.955 --> 31:31.888
What was Mr. Baldwin's
reaction, if any,

31:31.890 --> 31:32.856
when you told him
what had happened?

31:32.858 --> 31:34.587
He was calm.

31:35.059 --> 31:38.595
- Calm?
- That's right.

31:38.597 --> 31:41.798
He was calm when you told him you
had just killed American Marines?

31:41.800 --> 31:45.302
In my experience,
uh, internal and external,

31:45.304 --> 31:47.070
reactions are greatly
disparate in my line of work.

31:47.072 --> 31:49.406
AJ was a professional.

31:49.408 --> 31:51.353
How did he instruct
you to proceed?

31:51.388 --> 31:53.239
No, he didn't.

31:54.645 --> 31:56.446
So...

31:56.448 --> 31:59.416
You just dropped $10 million

31:59.418 --> 32:00.817
on the floor of his office
and left?

32:00.819 --> 32:03.153
It wasn't his job
to instruct us.

32:03.155 --> 32:05.088
It was his job to make sure
operations ran smoothly.

32:05.090 --> 32:06.890
And when they didn't?

32:06.892 --> 32:09.159
It was his job
to figure out why.

32:09.161 --> 32:10.927
And where you involved
in that process?

32:10.929 --> 32:13.288
- I was.
- What did it entail?

32:13.431 --> 32:16.333
AJ set up a meeting with
my team and the DOD,

32:16.335 --> 32:17.968
where the order
originated from.

32:17.970 --> 32:20.137
Who did you meet with?

32:20.139 --> 32:23.048
Lloyd Roberts, special aide to the office
of General Lance Howard.

32:25.510 --> 32:26.977
Thanks again for letting me
use your kitchen.

32:26.979 --> 32:28.812
This is good.

32:28.814 --> 32:30.147
- Needs a little more Cayenne pepper.
- Not too much.

32:30.149 --> 32:31.781
He won't like it.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.917
True.
The boy does have a stomach.

32:33.919 --> 32:36.486
This dinner needs
to go perfect.

32:36.788 --> 32:40.156
Honey, I just don't want you
to get your hopes up.

32:40.158 --> 32:42.559
- What?
- Well, this is nice and all, but...

32:42.561 --> 32:43.793
these things take time.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.642
Ugh, it's been almost a week.

32:46.597 --> 32:48.264
Well...

32:48.266 --> 32:49.799
I'm just saying that eventually

32:49.801 --> 32:51.401
he'll come around,
but if you force it...

32:51.403 --> 32:54.003
Look, I know I can
be a problem sometimes,

32:54.005 --> 32:56.739
but things are different now.

32:56.741 --> 32:59.342
Maybe for you.
Not for him.

32:59.344 --> 33:02.453
I just, I want him to see
that I'm trying, you know.

33:02.646 --> 33:05.038
Yeah. Come here.

33:06.917 --> 33:07.917
It's okay, baby.

33:10.087 --> 33:11.636
Hey, Aunty.

33:15.192 --> 33:18.227
I hope you got plenty of that brisket.

33:18.228 --> 33:19.095
Be nice.

33:20.898 --> 33:23.566
What...
What is she doin' here?

33:23.568 --> 33:25.668
She wanted to cook you
something special.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.537
I made you my chicken stew.

33:27.539 --> 33:29.639
Aunty, you know
this ain't gonna work.

33:29.641 --> 33:30.773
Family's together,
it always works.

33:33.911 --> 33:35.611
- Tell her I got called out.
- Please.

33:37.915 --> 33:39.816
The chicken stew ain't gonna
change nothin'.

33:39.818 --> 33:41.250
It maybe could say
"I'm sorry."

33:41.252 --> 33:43.653
You born sorry.
Always apologizing.

33:43.655 --> 33:44.620
I quit drinking.

33:46.090 --> 33:47.824
- Since when? Since breakfast?
- No, for real.

33:47.826 --> 33:49.526
It's different now.

33:49.528 --> 33:52.028
- I have a job.
- T, I don't need this right now.

33:52.030 --> 33:53.163
I got too much shit
going on in my head.

33:53.165 --> 33:55.162
- We're blood.
- Blood?

33:55.333 --> 33:57.517
Blood don't steal from blood.

33:59.337 --> 34:01.360
I ain't a bad person, Mar.

34:01.639 --> 34:04.040
I know you know that.

34:04.042 --> 34:06.402
Sure, I fuck up
now and then, but...

34:06.944 --> 34:10.213
You know I would never
harm you purposefully.

34:10.215 --> 34:12.614
Now, that's what I like to see.

34:12.617 --> 34:16.101
Vegetables will be done
in five minutes. Wash up.

34:19.223 --> 34:21.380
- Fuck it, I'm out.
- You owe me.

34:21.382 --> 34:23.377
What do you want from me?

34:23.793 --> 34:25.562
I want to be brother and
sister like always.

34:25.864 --> 34:27.496
You destroyed that, T.

34:27.498 --> 34:28.598
It is different now.

34:29.299 --> 34:30.667
I need you more.

34:33.437 --> 34:35.371
I made you my chicken stew.

34:45.349 --> 34:47.917
Take Aunty to Oscar's.

34:52.989 --> 34:56.259
He's deep in your brain,
screwin' up all your righteous thinking.

34:56.261 --> 34:59.496
You a black-ass fool, Marlon,
buyin' that man's shit.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.731
- He took care of both of us.
- Sure, he did.

35:01.733 --> 35:04.567
Marlon's gonna be
a big ass businessman.

35:04.569 --> 35:06.936
Marlon's gonna sit the table with them
fancy-ass white folk.

35:06.938 --> 35:08.872
You his nigga, Marlon.

35:08.874 --> 35:11.174
He tells you to bend over,

35:11.176 --> 35:14.110
you say yes and spread them fine
black cheeks as wide as they go.

35:14.112 --> 35:16.713
Mr. Marty Stein's dandy nigga,

35:16.715 --> 35:18.848
his mandingo slave boy.

35:20.585 --> 35:23.086
Oh, my God.

35:23.088 --> 35:24.788
- Come on, get up. Let me help you.
- Fuck you!

35:52.216 --> 35:54.818
- Fuck.
- Oh, shit. Officer Finn!

35:54.820 --> 35:57.220
Jesus, Sasha,
it's not even 8:00 AM.

35:57.222 --> 35:59.456
Hummer and a cup of coffee.
Great way to start the day.

35:59.458 --> 36:01.157
What do you got for me?

36:01.159 --> 36:03.960
I mean, Breeds got lips squeezed
tighter than a Catholic school girl.

36:03.962 --> 36:05.094
You're very funny,
you know that?

36:05.096 --> 36:06.396
Come here,
I wanna show you something.

36:09.134 --> 36:11.801
This Ty motherfucker
tried to kill my partner,

36:11.803 --> 36:13.403
and someone is gonna
die for that, Sasha.

36:13.405 --> 36:14.637
And I don't
particularly care who.

36:14.639 --> 36:17.173
Okay, fuck. Okay.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.342
One of Ty's boys, Malcolm,

36:19.344 --> 36:20.910
likes his balls sucked
a couple of times a week.

36:20.912 --> 36:24.080
I usually go to his crib
over on 12th,

36:24.082 --> 36:26.483
but yesterday, he says I should
meet him at a different place.

36:26.485 --> 36:28.451
- Where?
- 193 Dowling Street.

36:28.453 --> 36:30.620
Apartment 202.

36:30.622 --> 36:32.489
- How do you know Ty's gonna be there?
- I don't.

36:32.491 --> 36:35.138
But Malcolm's his
number one bodyguard.

36:36.594 --> 36:37.927
193 Dowling.

36:37.929 --> 36:40.830
Apartment 202.

36:40.832 --> 36:42.757
You better not be fucking
with me, Sasha.

36:46.036 --> 36:48.382
Hey. Yeah, I got him.

36:50.674 --> 36:52.842
So, who thinks this guy
is batshit crazy?

36:52.844 --> 36:55.011
He did volunteer to fight
in Afghanistan, twice.

36:55.013 --> 36:56.880
He also confessed
to three murders.

36:56.882 --> 36:58.781
My point exactly.
What sane person does that?

36:58.783 --> 37:00.850
Especially when we don't even know
that a crime's been committed.

37:00.852 --> 37:02.318
It's called conscience.

37:02.320 --> 37:03.853
I read about it in a book.

37:03.855 --> 37:05.822
All three of the DOAs
checked out,

37:05.824 --> 37:07.790
but they were listed as killed
in a helicopter crash.

37:07.792 --> 37:08.992
You think Kelly's full of shit?

37:08.994 --> 37:10.693
Or the dead Marines were
doing something

37:10.695 --> 37:11.861
they shouldn't have been doing,

37:11.863 --> 37:13.129
and Kelly's part of
the cover up.

37:13.131 --> 37:16.132
Or he's a good guy
with no personal agenda,

37:16.134 --> 37:18.902
who simply got caught up
in a bad situation and can't live with it.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.637
Think Kelly's trying to
protect Roberts?

37:20.639 --> 37:24.073
Why not? Roberts is
General Lance Howard's right-hand.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.838
That's four-star
General Howard, by the way.

37:26.873 --> 37:29.078
Shit.

37:29.080 --> 37:32.749
Could be looking at corruption that reaches
to the highest levels of the US military.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.251
Embezzlement, murder, conspiracy.
Who knows what else.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.320
Only we don't have shit
on either Roberts or Howard.

37:37.322 --> 37:39.155
We have Kelly's sworn
statement.

37:39.157 --> 37:41.658
In which he doesn't directly
incriminate anyone but himself.

37:41.660 --> 37:44.595
Yet. We just have
to connect the dots.

37:44.630 --> 37:47.074
I want to talk to Kelly alone.

37:52.436 --> 37:54.170
Is this CI reliable?

37:54.172 --> 37:56.406
She knows people,
people who know people.

37:56.408 --> 37:58.174
Like, 40 bucks a pop
knows people?

37:58.176 --> 38:00.206
I do know women who aren't
hookers, you know.

38:00.511 --> 38:01.678
I'm going in first.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.079
D, we got six guys.

38:03.081 --> 38:04.750
I'm first.

38:51.428 --> 38:54.063
- You gonna let me finish?
- All right.

40:02.666 --> 40:06.454
Pastrami, Swiss,
extra Russian dressing.

40:08.539 --> 40:11.641
It's gonna take a lot more
than a sandwich, Patty.

40:11.643 --> 40:14.277
It's not the first time the source screwed
the pooch and it will not be the last.

40:15.245 --> 40:16.813
Never trust a hooker.

40:16.815 --> 40:18.681
Story of my life.

40:18.683 --> 40:21.417
I knew it. All your CIs are
fucking hookers.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.390
It's the noblest profession.

40:23.754 --> 40:25.425
Oldest.

40:26.557 --> 40:27.924
Why can't it be both?

40:27.926 --> 40:29.425
I mean, Sasha...

40:29.427 --> 40:31.027
Her info might have been good.

40:31.029 --> 40:33.596
And Ty just relocated.

40:33.598 --> 40:36.214
There wasn't a stick
of furniture in that place.

40:37.234 --> 40:38.334
Why am I doing this?

40:38.336 --> 40:40.054
You screwed up.

40:40.170 --> 40:42.004
Because I brought the goodies!

40:42.006 --> 40:44.874
You know what, word of advice,

40:44.876 --> 40:46.576
you want to get along
with the male of the species,

40:46.578 --> 40:48.745
a little thank you
goes a very long way.

40:48.747 --> 40:52.115
Do I hear one ounce of
gratitude from you

40:52.117 --> 40:55.901
for writing 12 pages on why we broke
into an empty fucking apartment?

40:55.936 --> 40:57.353
Whoa!

40:57.355 --> 40:59.049
Fire in the hole.

41:04.528 --> 41:06.229
Jack's gonna propose.

41:06.231 --> 41:08.564
Oh, yeah? To who?

41:08.566 --> 41:11.901
I found a ring hidden
in his shoe in his closet.

41:14.438 --> 41:16.267
Congratulations?

41:19.710 --> 41:22.779
I mean, I'm sorry?

41:22.781 --> 41:26.091
The only reason I found it was cause I
was looking through his stuff for drugs.

41:27.618 --> 41:29.652
- You didn't find any?
- Of course not.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.453
So, that's...
that's a good thing.

41:32.990 --> 41:34.924
I don't trust him, Patty.

41:34.926 --> 41:37.204
How can I marry a guy
I don't trust?

41:38.829 --> 41:40.761
You gonna eat the chips?

41:52.776 --> 41:54.817
Charles Ponzi.

41:55.312 --> 41:57.527
Grigory Potemkin.

41:58.081 --> 41:59.482
- Ow.
- Sorry.

41:59.484 --> 42:02.112
No, that's so good!

42:03.320 --> 42:04.820
Let us not forget Frank Abagnale.

42:06.123 --> 42:08.124
- Never heard of him.
- You're kidding.

42:08.126 --> 42:10.159
Leonardo Dicaprio,
in that movie?

42:10.161 --> 42:12.361
<i>Catch Me motherfucker,</i>
<i>whatever.</i>

42:13.964 --> 42:16.098
Tom Hanks chased him
all over the world.

42:16.100 --> 42:18.267
I missed it.

42:18.269 --> 42:20.413
The greatest confidence man
the world has ever seen.

42:21.271 --> 42:24.936
What did these men know
that mere mortals don't?

42:25.509 --> 42:29.111
That human nature is 99% greed.

42:29.113 --> 42:31.147
Money and the chance
to beat the other guy.

42:31.149 --> 42:34.407
Sex. Sex.
Sex is always a thing.

42:35.786 --> 42:38.246
Put a little bait
in front of any one of them,

42:38.281 --> 42:40.022
and he or she...

42:40.024 --> 42:41.792
I am not sexist.

42:42.826 --> 42:44.327
They will look at a potato
and see the hope diamond.

42:45.797 --> 42:47.576
I'll get it.

42:54.872 --> 42:56.472
Ray Williams' wife
changed her mind.

42:56.474 --> 42:59.342
What? Why?

42:59.344 --> 43:01.911
She told me to tell you
to go fuck yourself, that's why.

43:01.913 --> 43:04.647
- You offered her more money?
- Double.

43:04.649 --> 43:07.183
- Didn't make a difference.
- But if the US attorney believes Ethan...

43:07.185 --> 43:10.086
We could have a whole bus load
of nuns telling the story.

43:10.088 --> 43:11.888
If Donna and Connie
don't sing from the same hymn sheet,

43:11.890 --> 43:13.222
tell them
Roberts paid them off.

43:13.224 --> 43:14.724
There's no probable cause.

43:14.726 --> 43:16.993
No warrant to search his home.

43:16.995 --> 43:19.061
Then they don't find
the money...

43:19.063 --> 43:21.384
and then they've got
nothing on Roberts.

43:21.419 --> 43:23.099
And then,

43:23.101 --> 43:25.332
they've got nothing on Howard.

43:26.003 --> 43:28.337
And the whole scheme is fucked!

43:28.339 --> 43:30.245
And Ethan rots
in a federal pen.

43:30.280 --> 43:31.918
Take me to Dearborn.

43:36.280 --> 43:39.461
And sometimes,
a potato is just a potato.

43:41.051 --> 43:43.382
So, Mr. Kelly...

43:44.121 --> 43:45.902
Video recorder's off.

43:47.124 --> 43:48.996
What difference does that make?

43:49.726 --> 43:52.061
Well, it's just you and
me talking man-to-man, so to speak.

43:52.063 --> 43:54.530
No legalese. No on the record.

43:54.532 --> 43:57.733
Just two people trying to
make sense of what happened.

43:57.735 --> 43:59.902
- I told you what happened.
- You told me a story.

43:59.904 --> 44:01.537
Well, what else
was I supposed to tell you?

44:01.539 --> 44:02.805
Nobody dragged me in here,
Miss Richmond.

44:02.807 --> 44:04.273
I confessed willingly.

44:04.275 --> 44:06.574
Okay, well...
humor me on this.

44:06.910 --> 44:09.078
The way I see it, it's like,

44:09.080 --> 44:11.948
a ball balanced
on the point of a pencil.

44:11.950 --> 44:15.251
And a sneeze,
even the smallest sneeze,

44:15.253 --> 44:17.553
a hiccup, anything like that,

44:17.555 --> 44:20.556
could knock the ball off
on to one side of the line or the other.

44:20.558 --> 44:22.124
Why would I care?

44:22.126 --> 44:23.759
Because, between me and you,

44:23.761 --> 44:26.162
it's the difference between you
walking out of here a free man

44:26.164 --> 44:28.597
or spending the rest of your life
in a federal penitentiary.

44:28.599 --> 44:31.532
You know, I'm a little lost.
Where are you headed with this?

44:31.902 --> 44:33.521
Sure.

44:34.171 --> 44:35.830
Right.

44:36.139 --> 44:37.640
You're good at it.

44:37.642 --> 44:39.141
But you already know that.

44:39.143 --> 44:40.476
Good at what?

44:40.478 --> 44:42.241
Contrition.

44:42.913 --> 44:45.314
Or rather, you're good
at playing contrition.

44:45.316 --> 44:47.552
That would be more accurate.

44:51.755 --> 44:53.923
I've had hundreds of guys
sit in that chair

44:53.925 --> 44:57.430
and tell me a pool
full of piss is champagne.

44:58.462 --> 45:02.598
And I am proud to say that while
I may have dipped my toes in once or twice,

45:02.600 --> 45:05.066
I never dove in for a swim.

45:06.536 --> 45:09.538
Miss Richmond, let me be
very clear with you.

45:09.540 --> 45:12.774
I have told you, and your colleagues,
everything that I know.

45:12.876 --> 45:14.610
Tell me more.

45:14.612 --> 45:17.636
About Lloyd Roberts.
And General Howard.

45:21.852 --> 45:24.487
Chain of command bullshit.

45:24.489 --> 45:27.990
"Never accuse your superiors."
I understand that.

45:27.992 --> 45:31.236
The thing is, Mr. Kelly,
you're not in the army anymore.

45:31.995 --> 45:32.895
I'm aware of that.

45:37.467 --> 45:40.526
I see the piss
filling the pool, Ethan.

45:42.639 --> 45:44.473
- Mr. Stein!
- Excuse me.

45:44.475 --> 45:45.674
- I couldn't stop him.
- Excuse me.

45:45.676 --> 45:47.176
Don't say another word.

45:47.178 --> 45:49.478
Cynthia, you know
better than this.

45:49.480 --> 45:52.014
- He waived counsel.
- Well, I am un-waiving it.

45:52.016 --> 45:54.083
Marty, you could have
saved yourself a trip.

45:54.085 --> 45:55.551
We have a full confession
on videotape.

45:55.553 --> 45:58.020
Ethan Kelly, you are
under arrest for murder.

45:58.022 --> 45:59.588
You have
the right to remain silent.

45:59.590 --> 46:01.057
You have the right to a lawyer.

46:01.059 --> 46:03.125
I am his fucking lawyer!
