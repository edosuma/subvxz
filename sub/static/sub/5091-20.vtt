00:14.202 --> 00:16.085
So...

00:16.085 --> 00:17.938
what did you think?

00:17.939 --> 00:19.156
Well, who knew

00:19.157 --> 00:22.225
that beef lollipop
and foie gras mousse and mint

00:22.226 --> 00:23.643
could be so delicious.

00:23.644 --> 00:26.146
You're making fun of me.

00:26.147 --> 00:27.764
No, I loved it.

00:27.765 --> 00:30.000
Now I see why it's so hard
to get in this place.

00:33.621 --> 00:36.406
I had the best day
today, Maggie.

00:36.407 --> 00:39.042
You should see your face
right now-- you're beaming.

00:39.043 --> 00:40.544
It's all the sun we got

00:40.545 --> 00:42.212
on the water taxi
to Battery Park.

00:42.213 --> 00:43.947
I gotta say, the
Statue of Liberty

00:43.948 --> 00:45.715
from that
perspective...

00:45.716 --> 00:47.250
really was something.

00:47.251 --> 00:49.219
Yeah.
Guys?

00:49.220 --> 00:50.420
Excuse me,
I hate to interrupt

00:50.421 --> 00:52.022
but they want me
to close out for the night.

00:52.023 --> 00:54.174
Oh sure. You need us
to settle up? No problem.

00:54.175 --> 00:55.792
How was everything?
Fantastic.

00:55.793 --> 00:58.127
My wife kept telling me,

00:58.128 --> 01:00.230
Iowa's got nothing like this.

01:00.231 --> 01:02.199
That's the state
that grows all the corn?

01:02.200 --> 01:03.667
Or is it potatoes?

01:03.668 --> 01:05.235
Oh, corn.

01:05.236 --> 01:07.804
Though most of what I grow now
is turned into biofuel.

01:07.805 --> 01:09.272
Ethanol.

01:09.273 --> 01:11.524
It's a renewable
energy source.

01:11.525 --> 01:13.643
My husband loves his work.

01:13.644 --> 01:14.744
Cool.

01:14.745 --> 01:16.680
Well, listen,
enjoy the rest of your trip.

01:16.681 --> 01:18.481
For you.

01:18.482 --> 01:20.951
Thank you.

01:20.952 --> 01:23.086
You sure I can't get you
anything else before I go?

01:23.087 --> 01:24.955
No, we're fine.
I am just

01:24.956 --> 01:27.824
going to go and have
my after dinner cigar.

01:27.825 --> 01:30.193
But not right
outside, okay?

01:30.194 --> 01:32.495
Um, smoke gets in:
customers hate it.

01:32.496 --> 01:35.515
But a little ways down
to the left is cool.

01:38.569 --> 01:41.771
I'll be back before
you finish your sambuca.

01:48.579 --> 01:50.897
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

01:51.949 --> 01:54.901
Well, you said you were
running a half-hour behind,

01:54.902 --> 01:56.903
so that makes you on time.

01:58.456 --> 02:00.090
Long day?

02:00.091 --> 02:03.493
Some eight-hour days
feel like a week.

02:03.494 --> 02:05.762
Yeah.

02:05.763 --> 02:07.764
Anything you want to unload?

02:08.666 --> 02:10.166
How are you?

02:10.167 --> 02:12.402
Me?

02:12.403 --> 02:14.037
Well, I'm headed
for another run-in

02:14.038 --> 02:15.105
with the Port Authority...

02:15.106 --> 02:17.540
Ian Boyd was shot dead today.

02:17.541 --> 02:19.542
Good. Who shot him?

02:19.543 --> 02:22.646
A convenience store owner
he was trying to rob,

02:22.647 --> 02:24.898
but not before he was...

02:24.899 --> 02:29.552
able to kill a young woman
who was also in the store.

02:29.553 --> 02:32.889
She was trying to warn the owner
she saw a gun.

02:32.890 --> 02:34.724
Ian shot her.

02:34.725 --> 02:36.726
She was pronounced dead
at the scene.

02:36.727 --> 02:39.229
I'm sorry.

02:40.364 --> 02:43.533
He should have been behind bars
from the last robbery.

02:43.534 --> 02:44.934
That was a jury's decision.

02:44.935 --> 02:47.771
Yeah, on a case that I lost.

02:47.772 --> 02:50.540
And because I lost it, he
was back on the streets,

02:50.541 --> 02:52.509
and because of that,
a young woman is dead.

02:52.510 --> 02:54.110
You can't tell me

02:54.111 --> 02:57.080
I don't bear
some responsibility for that.

02:57.915 --> 03:00.050
Okay.

03:02.453 --> 03:04.387
Menus or another round?

03:05.389 --> 03:07.457
Both.

03:23.207 --> 03:25.442
Did you try the monkfish?
I wanted to.

03:25.443 --> 03:26.643
It all sounded good.

03:26.644 --> 03:27.911
I had the bay
scallops...

03:29.947 --> 03:31.848
What was that?

03:31.849 --> 03:33.282
MAN 2:
Those were gunshots.

03:33.283 --> 03:34.918
They had to be.

03:34.919 --> 03:37.020
What's going on?

03:40.624 --> 03:42.458
Oh, God! Lance, no!

03:42.459 --> 03:43.893
No!

03:43.894 --> 03:46.629
Call 911!

03:46.630 --> 03:49.632
Hurry! My husband's been shot!

04:14.742 --> 04:16.048
All right,
let me get this straight.

04:16.050 --> 04:18.000
The shots ring out,
and after a quick peek

04:18.002 --> 04:20.220
the customers all just go back
to eating their meals,

04:20.221 --> 04:22.188
like nothing happened?
That's what they said.

04:22.189 --> 04:23.890
Must be one hell
of a restaurant--

04:23.891 --> 04:26.059
make you wait around for six
months for a reservation,

04:26.060 --> 04:27.627
then they don't even
let a man getting shot

04:27.628 --> 04:28.828
interrupt their dinner.

04:28.829 --> 04:30.063
What else you got for me?

04:30.064 --> 04:33.149
Well, the victim was a tourist
from Iowa, Lance Olson.

04:33.150 --> 04:35.635
He's at St. Benjamin's Hospital,
with the wife... Margaret.

04:35.636 --> 04:37.103
Shot three times.

04:37.104 --> 04:39.639
All his money
and his credit cards taken.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.608
You find a gun?
No. Not yet.

04:41.609 --> 04:44.160
Keep searching.
And what about the canvass?

04:44.161 --> 04:45.662
Some of the people
were sleeping.

04:45.663 --> 04:46.996
And, uh, the one's
that were awake

04:46.997 --> 04:48.248
apparently didn't think
it was that big of a deal.

04:48.249 --> 04:50.417
Gunshots are not new to
this neighborhood, no matter

04:50.418 --> 04:52.285
how many fancy restaurants
they put on this street.

04:52.286 --> 04:54.120
Canvass again,
just in case

04:54.121 --> 04:55.622
somebody didn't
answer their door.

04:55.623 --> 04:58.591
And widen the search perimeter
for the weapon, okay? Right.

04:58.592 --> 04:59.926
You know, Jack?

04:59.927 --> 05:01.094
You know what
I can't figure out?

05:01.095 --> 05:02.829
Nice, well lit up
area right here,

05:02.830 --> 05:04.531
nice little bench--
why is the husband over there

05:04.532 --> 05:06.015
smoking next
to a dark Dumpster?

05:06.016 --> 05:08.384
Well, the manager says that's
where they steer the smokers.

05:08.385 --> 05:12.105
Iowan tourist gunned down
in the, uh, Big Apple.

05:12.106 --> 05:14.140
Press is going to eat
this up, so to speak.

05:14.141 --> 05:17.177
Yeah, well, it's not our problem.
No.

05:22.583 --> 05:25.051
Why are you still up?

05:25.052 --> 05:27.737
Oh, Erin got
some bad new tonight.

05:27.738 --> 05:29.255
You remember the Boyd case?

05:29.256 --> 05:32.025
Sure. Where her eyewitness
got ripped apart on the stand.

05:32.026 --> 05:33.259
Well,

05:33.260 --> 05:35.895
he shot and killed a young woman
in a robbery attempt

05:35.896 --> 05:39.199
earlier tonight, before
the bodega owner killed him.

05:39.200 --> 05:41.000
How's she taking it?

05:41.836 --> 05:44.404
As you can imagine.

05:44.405 --> 05:46.239
Poor baby.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.808
She's successful

05:48.809 --> 05:50.677
because she's so hard
on herself,

05:50.678 --> 05:53.580
but she pays dearly for it.

05:53.581 --> 05:57.116
And I still worry about her
like she's...

05:57.117 --> 05:59.519
Like she's your own kid?

06:03.123 --> 06:05.391
Does that ever go away?

06:05.392 --> 06:07.226
Not really.

06:07.227 --> 06:09.195
I'll make
some coffee.

06:12.449 --> 06:15.702
Well, if I wasn't
awake, I would be now.

06:15.703 --> 06:17.504
What happened?

06:19.740 --> 06:23.276
A tourist was shot on
the Lower East Side.

06:23.277 --> 06:26.596
He's critical.

06:41.629 --> 06:43.396
Mrs. Olson?

06:43.397 --> 06:46.266
Detective Reagan.
My partner, Detective Curatola.

06:52.656 --> 06:55.291
He just got out
of surgery.

06:55.292 --> 06:58.161
They think
they stopped the bleeding,

06:58.162 --> 07:00.413
but they said it was...
very bad.

07:01.782 --> 07:03.550
Uh...

07:03.551 --> 07:04.951
We know it's a trying
time for you.

07:04.952 --> 07:07.287
We need to ask you
some questions,

07:07.288 --> 07:09.088
and we're hoping
that you can help us.

07:09.089 --> 07:12.792
What am I going to do
if he doesn't pull through?

07:12.793 --> 07:15.261
We understand you were
the first person

07:15.262 --> 07:16.763
to find your husband
after he was shot.

07:16.764 --> 07:18.431
Did you see anyone,

07:18.432 --> 07:21.367
anything, anybody follow him
out of the restaurant?

07:21.368 --> 07:24.170
I heard the gunshots
and I ran outside.

07:24.171 --> 07:27.173
My husband was lying
on the ground.

07:28.075 --> 07:30.243
It's my fault.

07:30.244 --> 07:32.045
I dragged him here.

07:32.046 --> 07:35.548
I came her with my girlfriends,
shopping and seeing shows,

07:35.549 --> 07:38.150
and... I love it here.

07:38.151 --> 07:40.319
And I wanted him to,
as well.

07:41.121 --> 07:43.623
Um, Mrs. Olson, um...

07:43.624 --> 07:45.291
when you were outside,
did you see anything?

07:45.292 --> 07:46.960
A car? Anyone around?

07:46.961 --> 07:49.362
I don't know.

07:49.363 --> 07:52.332
Right when I was coming out,
somebody passed me.

07:52.333 --> 07:53.733
Did you get a look at them?

07:53.734 --> 07:55.468
It happened so fast.

07:55.469 --> 07:56.736
Was it a man,
a woman?

07:56.737 --> 07:58.838
Did you see
what they were wearing?

07:58.839 --> 08:01.040
Were they short? Tall?
Man.

08:02.109 --> 08:05.645
He had on one of those, um,
sweatshirts with a hood.

08:05.646 --> 08:07.080
Do you know what color?

08:07.081 --> 08:11.050
Blue? It was dark colored.

08:11.051 --> 08:13.019
How about his face?

08:13.020 --> 08:15.588
He had the hood up.

08:15.589 --> 08:19.158
I didn't get a good look,
because Lance...

08:19.159 --> 08:21.494
Mrs. Olson, the manager
of the restaurant

08:21.495 --> 08:24.364
said that your husband
paid a very large bill in cash.

08:24.365 --> 08:26.866
Is it typical for him
to carry a lot of cash around?

08:26.867 --> 08:28.334
He likes to pay cash.

08:28.335 --> 08:31.204
He says
businesses appreciate it.

08:31.205 --> 08:32.972
Okay, so he had a
lot of cash on him.

08:32.972 --> 08:36.509
Who would have known that?
Today? Yesterday?

08:36.510 --> 08:39.679
We got in...

08:39.679 --> 08:44.082
We stayed in the room
at the hotel all night.

08:44.083 --> 08:45.885
This is kind of
a second honeymoon.

08:45.886 --> 08:49.722
We've been married ten years.

08:49.723 --> 08:51.524
The bellman.

08:51.525 --> 08:54.394
The... cabdriver.

08:54.395 --> 08:56.462
The waitress
at the restaurant tonight.

08:56.463 --> 08:59.499
Lance gave her
a really nice tip.

08:59.500 --> 09:01.267
That's Lance.

09:01.268 --> 09:04.003
Nice to everyone.

09:04.004 --> 09:05.972
You've been very helpful.

09:05.973 --> 09:08.975
We'll find out who did this
to your husband, Mrs. Olson.

09:08.976 --> 09:11.144
Thank you.

09:11.145 --> 09:14.747
Caucasian male,
approximately 74 years old.

09:14.748 --> 09:16.983
Fixed posterior...
Condition the body's in;

09:16.984 --> 09:18.634
he's been dead at least a day,
I would say.

09:18.635 --> 09:20.920
...gauge syringe found on the body.
Hundreds of people walk by,

09:20.921 --> 09:22.422
and nobody bothers
to call, you know?

09:22.423 --> 09:25.441
Guess they figure
he's homeless; who cares?

09:25.442 --> 09:28.227
But he was someone's loved one.

09:28.228 --> 09:30.763
Figure... just being human
should earn you better.

09:30.764 --> 09:33.533
Right? I mean...
Yeah.

09:35.903 --> 09:37.837
Excuse me, Dr. Trent?

09:37.838 --> 09:39.439
Reagan, it's our
second crime scene,

09:39.440 --> 09:41.107
you can call me Laura.

09:41.108 --> 09:42.542
Uh, Laura, I was
just wondering, um,

09:42.543 --> 09:44.210
are you writing it up
as natural causes?

09:44.211 --> 09:46.479
Well, insulin found
on the body

09:46.480 --> 09:47.814
initially indicated
complications

09:47.815 --> 09:48.948
arising from diabetes.

09:48.949 --> 09:51.984
But neon green fluid
in the mouth cavity

09:51.985 --> 09:53.186
could be antifreeze.

09:53.187 --> 09:54.954
Have to wait on the
tox screen, though.

09:54.955 --> 09:56.189
So you're calling it a homicide?

09:56.190 --> 09:57.657
Preliminarily.

09:57.658 --> 09:58.975
Lots to learn back at the lab.

09:58.976 --> 10:01.227
So it's totality
of circumstances.

10:01.228 --> 10:03.796
Exactly. Why are you
so interested?

10:03.797 --> 10:05.648
I'm only on the job
six months,

10:05.649 --> 10:06.816
so I figure
the best way to learn

10:06.817 --> 10:09.035
is to... ask questions
of smart people.

10:09.036 --> 10:11.504
Well, you're right.

10:11.505 --> 10:13.840
Ask questions,
keep an open mind,

10:13.841 --> 10:15.708
work hard.

10:15.709 --> 10:18.544
I appreciate you taking
the time, Dr.... Laura.

10:18.545 --> 10:21.414
Keep up the good work, Reagan.

10:21.415 --> 10:23.199
Thanks. I'll try.

10:25.953 --> 10:27.370
Attaboy.
What?

10:27.371 --> 10:29.689
Shame on you, Reagan.
What?

10:29.690 --> 10:31.791
Hitting on a doctor,
over a body?

10:31.792 --> 10:33.926
Do you also flirt at funerals?

10:33.927 --> 10:35.711
Hey, I'm just trying
to learn, okay?

10:35.712 --> 10:37.046
You-you-you jealous
somebody else

10:37.047 --> 10:38.364
might have something
to teach me?

10:38.365 --> 10:40.433
Knucklehead, go.

10:40.434 --> 10:43.102
Okay, Sarge.

10:46.140 --> 10:47.907
Can we just jump
right in?

10:47.908 --> 10:49.609
Do you have
another speed?

10:49.610 --> 10:50.777
No, I don't.

10:50.778 --> 10:51.944
Tourism in New York

10:51.945 --> 10:53.613
is a multibillion-dollar
industry,

10:53.614 --> 10:56.732
partly predicated on
a kind of safari model.

10:56.733 --> 10:57.867
They're going to be disappointed

10:57.868 --> 10:59.685
if they don't get close
to the lions and tigers,

10:59.686 --> 11:02.288
but <i>really</i> disappointed
if one of them eats 'em.

11:02.289 --> 11:03.422
It's a fine line.

11:03.423 --> 11:05.091
That's a pretty harsh way
to put it.

11:05.092 --> 11:06.993
Yes, it is,
but that's the version

11:06.994 --> 11:08.561
the press will hammer you on.

11:08.562 --> 11:10.296
This is a safe city.

11:10.297 --> 11:12.265
Not for white Iowa farmer
Mr. Olson,

11:12.266 --> 11:14.167
it turned out,
and he's the story.

11:14.168 --> 11:15.668
I am not going to try

11:15.669 --> 11:18.504
and parse this tragedy
along racial divides.

11:18.505 --> 11:21.040
With all due respect, it's not
going to be your choice.

11:21.041 --> 11:22.508
The elephant's
already in the room.

11:22.509 --> 11:25.278
I can speak to the facts.
I don't have to join the circus.

11:25.279 --> 11:27.513
Frank, whether you like it
or not, you're going to have

11:27.514 --> 11:29.582
to play to the house
on this, just a little.

11:29.583 --> 11:31.450
Just enough to show that
you share the outrage.

11:31.451 --> 11:34.053
I do, Garrett.
A man was murdered.

11:34.054 --> 11:36.823
You know what I mean.
I hate that you know what you mean.

11:36.824 --> 11:38.257
I'm just doing my job.

11:38.258 --> 11:39.525
I hate that, too.

11:39.526 --> 11:41.194
I can stall until Monday

11:41.195 --> 11:43.095
without looking
like we're stalling.

11:44.565 --> 11:46.299
The press conference
must be timely,

11:46.300 --> 11:48.701
but independent
of any progress on the case.

11:48.702 --> 11:50.920
There can be no rush to
judgment here. Done.

11:50.921 --> 11:53.039
Thank you.
Welcome.

11:57.144 --> 11:58.311
All right. Thanks.

11:58.312 --> 12:00.579
Well, we can forget
about the cabdriver.

12:00.580 --> 12:01.914
He picked up
two fares after

12:01.915 --> 12:03.582
he dropped the Olsons
at the restaurant,

12:03.583 --> 12:05.017
and his GPS shows him in Yonkers

12:05.018 --> 12:06.352
at the time of
the shooting.

12:06.353 --> 12:08.888
Well, this waitress--
I don't know what to say.

12:08.889 --> 12:11.157
I mean, she has no record,
but we can't find her anywhere.

12:11.158 --> 12:12.792
She won't answer her phone
or her door.

12:12.793 --> 12:13.893
Well, she's a possible, though.

12:13.894 --> 12:15.194
Mm-hmm. I mean, she works
in the restaurant.

12:15.195 --> 12:17.496
She sees Mr. Olson
pull out all that cash,

12:17.497 --> 12:19.932
she calls an accomplice,
Mr. Olson goes outside to smoke.

12:19.933 --> 12:22.168
Accomplish shows up, boom,
it all goes bad. Right.

12:22.169 --> 12:24.837
Well, I have her employee record
from the restaurant.

12:24.838 --> 12:26.572
I'm thinking maybe
an emergency contact

12:26.573 --> 12:28.541
can help us out
somewhere.

12:28.542 --> 12:30.142
What about the armed robberies
in the neighborhood?

12:30.143 --> 12:31.577
Four of them in
the last year.

12:31.578 --> 12:33.963
Two of them went unsolved,
one guy's still in Rikers,

12:33.964 --> 12:36.249
and the fourth one,
Brian Stratton, walked

12:36.250 --> 12:40.286
because the, uh, victim
never showed up.

12:40.287 --> 12:42.672
Wait. You said Brian...
Brian Stratton?

12:42.673 --> 12:44.290
Yeah. Why?

12:44.291 --> 12:46.993
Brian Stratton's
her emergency contact.

12:46.994 --> 12:48.127
The waitress?
Yeah.

12:48.128 --> 12:49.562
You kidding me? Yeah.
Wait one sec.

12:49.563 --> 12:51.197
And look at this.

12:51.198 --> 12:54.333
His number was called from
the, uh, the restaurant phone

12:54.334 --> 12:57.236
just before she clocked out.

12:57.237 --> 12:59.605
Our possible
just became a probable.

13:05.812 --> 13:07.546
Door's open.

13:07.547 --> 13:09.832
Looks like we're invited
to the party. Yup.

13:14.521 --> 13:16.455
Think they're rolling on E?
The love drug?

13:16.456 --> 13:18.157
This should be easy then.

13:18.158 --> 13:20.159
Hey, you Ecstasy heads.
Hey, you two.

13:20.160 --> 13:23.496
Get down. Get down.

13:23.497 --> 13:25.264
You want to dance
your way out of here?

13:25.265 --> 13:26.832
Oh, yeah, totally.

13:26.833 --> 13:28.968
Yeah? All right. NYPD.

13:31.505 --> 13:32.939
NYPD, morons.

13:32.940 --> 13:35.141
You're coming with us for
questioning in an assault case.

13:35.142 --> 13:37.276
Make that questioning
in a murder case.

13:37.277 --> 13:38.861
Lance Olson just died.

13:38.862 --> 13:40.363
What do you know.

13:40.364 --> 13:42.481
Get some clothes on.

13:51.351 --> 13:52.885
Do you have family
coming from Iowa?

13:52.886 --> 13:54.553
Mrs. Olson has suffered
a terrible loss.

13:54.554 --> 13:57.389
She will have the full resources
of the city at her disposal.

13:57.390 --> 13:58.974
The person responsible
for this heinous crime

13:58.975 --> 14:00.493
will be brought to justice.

14:00.494 --> 14:02.762
You have my word, and that of
the District Attorney's Office.

14:02.763 --> 14:04.480
Now, excuse me.
Do you have any idea who did this?

14:04.481 --> 14:06.132
Your sister's on the case?
Oh, yeah.

14:06.133 --> 14:08.167
Do you Reagans ever
take a day off?

14:08.168 --> 14:09.568
Not if we can help it.

14:09.569 --> 14:11.203
What about those yo-yos
we brought in,

14:11.204 --> 14:13.572
the waitress and her boyfriend--
they back down to earth yet?

14:13.573 --> 14:15.574
We'll find out.
Which one you want?

14:15.575 --> 14:16.709
Uh, I'll take the dancer.

14:16.710 --> 14:18.911
Since you already had
your turn with him.

14:18.912 --> 14:20.212
Ha-ha. Funny.

14:20.213 --> 14:21.714
You ever been
to prison, Maya?

14:21.715 --> 14:23.582
'Cause, I mean,
they got no Ecstasy there.

14:23.583 --> 14:25.718
Nothing to make the mean people
suddenly turn nice.

14:25.719 --> 14:27.470
You follow me?
I know.

14:27.471 --> 14:29.321
Hmm. So what was your plan, hmm?

14:29.322 --> 14:32.508
A little bump and grab,
get what you can?

14:32.509 --> 14:34.894
But you didn't have any idea Brian
was gonna bring a gun along.

14:34.895 --> 14:36.345
There was no gun!

14:36.346 --> 14:39.631
All we did was go score some E.

14:39.632 --> 14:41.066
She called me to pick her up,
that's it.

14:41.067 --> 14:42.301
Right, right, right.

14:42.302 --> 14:44.503
Fancy electronics,
couple hundred weekly on E.

14:44.504 --> 14:46.672
Money for that's got
to be coming from somewhere.

14:46.673 --> 14:49.108
We didn't jack anyone.

14:49.109 --> 14:50.442
You know what?

14:50.443 --> 14:52.278
Maya's probably already
told my partner

14:52.279 --> 14:53.579
everything he needs to know,

14:53.580 --> 14:55.648
and she's probably got
a sweet deal.

14:55.649 --> 14:57.950
Guess you're not getting one.
<i>Come on, Maya.</i>

14:57.951 --> 14:59.952
Just talk to me, all right?
I promise, you'll feel better.

14:59.953 --> 15:02.354
You'll go easy on the drugs
and everything?

15:02.355 --> 15:05.490
I'll see what I can do,
talk to the ADA,

15:05.491 --> 15:08.227
but you need to tell me
the truth right now.

15:09.513 --> 15:13.132
How we get extra cash is,
every once in a while,

15:13.133 --> 15:16.001
I get a bunch of customers'
numbers and sell them.

15:16.002 --> 15:17.369
Credit card numbers?

15:17.370 --> 15:19.388
The guy I work with
waits before using them

15:19.389 --> 15:20.890
so it doesn't track back to me.

15:20.891 --> 15:22.308
Okay. Now what about
the shooting?

15:22.309 --> 15:25.194
We had nothing to do with that murdered guy.
Come on, Maya.

15:25.195 --> 15:28.047
Brian picked me up, and we went
to East River Park to score.

15:28.048 --> 15:30.816
Come on.
That's it, I swear.

15:33.036 --> 15:35.404
Did you see anyone
outside that restaurant?

15:35.405 --> 15:36.889
No.

15:36.890 --> 15:40.025
But a couple
blocks away,

15:40.026 --> 15:43.696
we saw this black guy
tearing down the street

15:43.697 --> 15:46.165
in a hoodie, maybe blue.

15:46.166 --> 15:49.835
We nearly ran over
him on Brian's Vespa.

15:49.836 --> 15:52.471
We almost hit this crazy
black dude with my bike.

15:52.472 --> 15:53.706
Does that help?

15:53.707 --> 15:56.375
<i>Do your remember him</i>
<i>well enough</i>

15:56.376 --> 15:57.760
to work
with our sketch artist?

15:57.761 --> 16:00.045
Waiting tables,
you get a good memory for faces.

16:00.046 --> 16:02.081
I hope you're telling the truth,
'cause if not,

16:02.082 --> 16:04.617
you're gonna remember this face
for a long time.

16:07.020 --> 16:09.688
Extra uniformed officers

16:09.689 --> 16:12.858
and anticrime teams
have already been rotated

16:12.859 --> 16:15.127
into the popular tourist areas

16:15.128 --> 16:17.863
in the Lower East Side,
and other neighborhoods

16:17.864 --> 16:22.001
that are famously our city's
nightlife destinations.

16:22.002 --> 16:24.236
Commissioner? Commissioner?

16:24.237 --> 16:25.771
Isn't that a case of too little,
too late, Commissioner?

16:25.772 --> 16:28.374
No, it's question of
reacting appropriately

16:28.375 --> 16:31.043
to a tragic incident
that occurred in this city.

16:31.044 --> 16:34.013
I would like
to stress this here.

16:34.014 --> 16:35.547
We have seen no uptick

16:35.548 --> 16:37.683
in any of the metrics

16:37.684 --> 16:40.419
that we depend on
that says to me

16:40.420 --> 16:44.089
that the death of Mr. Olson
was part of a trend

16:44.090 --> 16:49.495
or wave or whatever term
you choose to overlay on it.

16:49.496 --> 16:51.397
Commissioner?
Yes.

16:51.398 --> 16:54.466
You yourself have ordered
an increased police presence

16:54.467 --> 16:56.285
in exactly the kinds
of neighborhoods

16:56.286 --> 16:57.736
where this murder took place.

16:57.737 --> 17:00.439
So that our citizens
and visitors alike

17:00.440 --> 17:02.508
could enjoy an added
sense of security.

17:02.509 --> 17:05.077
And I didn't hear
a question there. What's next?

17:05.078 --> 17:06.377
Here's my question,
Commissioner.

17:06.378 --> 17:08.146
Can you honestly say that...?

17:08.147 --> 17:10.015
If I say it,
it's my honest opinion.

17:10.016 --> 17:13.352
...that the effect
of this brutal murder,

17:13.353 --> 17:15.971
in terms of the profile
of this city and the

17:15.972 --> 17:19.358
$30 billion in tourism revenue
we depend on,

17:19.358 --> 17:20.726
can somehow be minimized

17:20.727 --> 17:23.695
by your department's
comforting statistics?

17:23.696 --> 17:25.964
Are you finished?

17:25.965 --> 17:27.965
Yes, sir.

17:27.967 --> 17:30.352
What we're really talking
about here is

17:30.353 --> 17:33.322
that a well-to-do white male
visiting from the Midwest

17:33.323 --> 17:35.674
was murdered in our city.

17:35.675 --> 17:39.678
Now, with the right kind
of purposeful slant,

17:39.679 --> 17:42.414
you can resurrect
an image of New York

17:42.415 --> 17:46.001
as a city of mean streets
and roaming predators,

17:46.002 --> 17:50.789
one that sells newspapers
and advertising minutes.

17:50.790 --> 17:53.992
But from where I sit,
the death of Mr. Olson,

17:53.993 --> 17:57.596
of two girls from Harlem
in a drive-by shooting,

17:57.597 --> 18:01.350
of an elderly man
from a mugging in the Bronx--

18:01.351 --> 18:06.472
these are all
equally unacceptable,

18:06.473 --> 18:09.191
and we try

18:09.192 --> 18:11.977
every day
to do everything we can

18:11.978 --> 18:15.180
to prevent them
from happening again.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.615
Thanks for coming.

18:19.652 --> 18:21.520
Those two flakes weren't lying
about their alibi.

18:21.521 --> 18:23.405
I found the drug dealer
in the park

18:23.406 --> 18:25.157
just where they said he'd be.
Oh.

18:25.158 --> 18:27.026
And he ID'd Brian
and Maya's pictures

18:27.027 --> 18:28.744
out of a dozen
I have here.

18:28.745 --> 18:31.463
Said they show up every
Thursday like clockwork.

18:31.464 --> 18:34.216
Well, I got the artist sketch
of Maya's description. Mmm.

18:34.217 --> 18:35.868
It's in the hands
of every uniform

18:35.869 --> 18:37.536
and detective
on the Lower East Side.

18:37.537 --> 18:39.671
They're checking it against
surveillance cameras,

18:39.672 --> 18:40.923
dog walkers, stoop sitters,

18:40.924 --> 18:43.075
anybody with eyes
on the streets.

18:43.076 --> 18:44.376
I don't know.

18:44.377 --> 18:45.811
You think this
guy's for real,

18:45.812 --> 18:47.346
or a hallucination
of some stoners?

18:47.347 --> 18:48.680
I don't know.

18:48.681 --> 18:50.783
Their alibi held up.

18:50.784 --> 18:52.384
Hold on, partner.

18:52.385 --> 18:53.986
We may be batting
a thousand.

18:53.987 --> 18:57.022
A bodega owner just recognized
the sketch. Let's go.

18:57.023 --> 18:58.357
It's Pierre.

18:58.358 --> 19:00.275
This Pierre--
does he have last name?

19:00.276 --> 19:01.693
No. Just Pierre.

19:01.694 --> 19:02.895
He's Haitian.

19:02.896 --> 19:04.596
Drives a cab
12 hours a day,

19:04.597 --> 19:06.098
then jogs
in the neighborhood afterwards.

19:06.099 --> 19:08.233
You know, I've told him,
a black man

19:08.234 --> 19:10.502
running at night
is just asking for trouble.

19:10.503 --> 19:12.571
He says it keeps him sane.

19:12.572 --> 19:14.423
He comes in for water

19:14.424 --> 19:16.175
and plantain chips
after his run.

19:16.176 --> 19:18.927
Do you know where he lives?
No. Is he in
some kind of trouble?

19:18.928 --> 19:21.380
Uh, just need to talk to him.
Look, you say Pierre

19:21.381 --> 19:23.748
drives a cab. You happen to know
which company he drives for?

19:23.749 --> 19:25.017
Steady Cabs.

19:25.018 --> 19:26.935
Real sweatshop.
Hmm.

19:26.936 --> 19:29.354
Pierre says he gets only
80 bucks for a 12-hour shift.

19:30.356 --> 19:32.474
Good. You've been a real help.

19:32.475 --> 19:35.094
I hope so. You know, most
of my customers are a pain,

19:35.095 --> 19:36.762
but Pierre--
he's one of the good ones.

19:36.763 --> 19:38.797
Good to know.

19:43.987 --> 19:45.404
Oh, here's number three.

19:45.405 --> 19:48.440
That's the number that the guy
from the cab company gave us.

19:54.631 --> 19:56.215
Yes?

19:56.216 --> 19:58.050
Police. Can you open
the door, ma'am?

19:58.051 --> 20:00.385
I need to ask you
a few questions.

20:02.288 --> 20:04.756
What's this about?

20:04.757 --> 20:06.291
We're looking for Pierre Dornay.
Is he here?

20:06.292 --> 20:08.594
Yes. That's my husband,
What's this about?

20:08.595 --> 20:11.196
We need to speak to him, ma'am.
Can you just get him, please?

20:11.197 --> 20:14.099
Pierre, it's the police.
They want to talk to you.

20:14.100 --> 20:14.967
Hey.

20:14.968 --> 20:17.169
Go around, Jackie. Hey!
Yeah.

20:18.905 --> 20:21.106
Hey!

20:22.609 --> 20:23.909
Hey! Stop!

20:23.910 --> 20:26.712
Police!

20:30.884 --> 20:33.452
Hey!

20:33.453 --> 20:35.320
Pierre!

20:35.321 --> 20:36.839
Hold up!

20:40.627 --> 20:42.761
Hold up!

20:45.131 --> 20:46.882
Hey!

20:48.051 --> 20:50.269
Stop!

20:51.387 --> 20:52.554
Where you going?
Where you going?

20:52.555 --> 20:54.072
Get your hands down
and turn around.

20:54.073 --> 20:55.224
Turn around!

20:55.225 --> 20:56.575
I did nothing wrong!

20:56.576 --> 20:59.077
Yeah, right, and
I'm Mother Teresa.

21:01.014 --> 21:03.148
Oh, and here they
come, the vultures.

21:03.149 --> 21:05.184
The only channel on their police
scanners they care for.

21:05.185 --> 21:06.685
All right, come on.

21:09.855 --> 21:11.924
Step back.
I said, move it.

21:13.243 --> 21:14.743
Come on!

21:14.744 --> 21:16.562
Step aside.

21:22.701 --> 21:25.703
Come on, innocent people do not
run from the police, Pierre.

21:25.704 --> 21:27.071
In my country, they do.

21:27.072 --> 21:28.673
Is that because
you were a dirty cop,

21:28.674 --> 21:30.074
and so they ran from you?

21:30.075 --> 21:31.609
I did nothing wrong.

21:31.610 --> 21:32.944
Yeah, well, your
record from Haiti says

21:32.945 --> 21:34.746
you were thrown off the
police force for stealing.

21:34.747 --> 21:36.281
That is a lie.

21:40.986 --> 21:45.290
I was trapped in the earthquake
for three days.

21:45.291 --> 21:46.891
I prayed to live.

21:46.892 --> 21:48.693
And a man--

21:48.694 --> 21:51.896
he said that God sent him
to dig,

21:51.897 --> 21:55.533
and so he dug day and night
until he found me.

21:55.534 --> 22:00.171
I knew from that point on,
I must always be a good man.

22:00.172 --> 22:05.009
So when I saw the others
stealing on the force, I told.

22:05.010 --> 22:08.079
They made up their lie
to silence me.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.682
Wow. That's a touching story.

22:10.683 --> 22:12.650
It's the truth.
All right.

22:12.651 --> 22:14.352
Let's say you are
telling the truth.

22:14.353 --> 22:16.804
That would put you about two
blocks from the restaurant

22:16.805 --> 22:18.489
right around the time
of the shooting.

22:18.490 --> 22:20.258
You see anything?
You hear anything?

22:20.259 --> 22:22.894
No. No, nothing of notice.

22:22.895 --> 22:25.563
Except a man
who walked past me.

22:25.564 --> 22:27.799
And what makes him so special?

22:27.800 --> 22:28.967
He walked quick quick.

22:28.968 --> 22:30.635
And he turned his head away

22:30.636 --> 22:33.037
like he purposefully
didn't want to be seen.

22:33.038 --> 22:34.706
Anything else?

22:34.707 --> 22:35.840
His clothes.

22:35.841 --> 22:37.909
Uh, they didn't match.

22:37.910 --> 22:40.278
On top he wore a big hoodie,
and on the bottom

22:40.279 --> 22:43.047
were nice trousers
and shiny leather shoes.

22:43.048 --> 22:44.916
It was strange.

22:51.156 --> 22:53.458
Police got a break
in the fatal shooting

22:53.459 --> 22:56.027
of Iowan farmer and tourist,
Lance Olson,

22:56.028 --> 22:58.730
when a Haitian cabdriver,
Pierre Dornay,

22:58.731 --> 23:01.165
was taken into custody
for the brutal murder

23:01.166 --> 23:03.568
of the heartland visitor
to New York City.

23:03.569 --> 23:05.770
Lance Olson,
a pioneer in the development

23:05.771 --> 23:07.238
of sustainable biofuels...

23:08.107 --> 23:10.024
All right, well,

23:10.025 --> 23:12.777
the wife didn't want to tell me,
but since she lost her job

23:12.778 --> 23:14.512
Pierre's been more and more
desperate for money.

23:14.513 --> 23:15.830
I'm thinking this is a guy

23:15.831 --> 23:18.016
in the wrong place
at the wrong time, Jack.

23:18.017 --> 23:19.183
Two witnesses put him running

23:19.184 --> 23:21.119
from the scene of the crime
just after the shooting.

23:21.120 --> 23:22.820
Where he apparently jogs
every night.

23:22.821 --> 23:25.423
And when we go to talk to him,
the guy dives out the window.

23:25.424 --> 23:26.891
Come on, Danny,
that's guilty as hell.

23:26.892 --> 23:29.160
I know he looks guilty, Jackie,
but it doesn't feel right.

23:29.161 --> 23:30.962
Come on, maybe
it's a coincidence.

23:30.963 --> 23:32.830
Look at the media:
"The heartland pioneer

23:32.831 --> 23:34.399
attacked by
the scary immigrant."

23:34.400 --> 23:36.667
I mean, they're throwing
this guy to the wolves.

23:36.668 --> 23:37.685
Doesn't feel right.

23:37.686 --> 23:39.771
Uh, well, explain
that to your sister.

23:39.772 --> 23:43.141
Detectives, I hear you have
a good suspect in custody.

23:43.142 --> 23:44.726
Well, that's
a matter of opinion,

23:44.727 --> 23:46.861
which at the moment
is split.

23:46.862 --> 23:49.180
You have anything on motive?

23:49.181 --> 23:50.214
They're drowning in debt.

23:50.215 --> 23:51.699
I mean, he has a list of thefts,

23:51.700 --> 23:53.451
although none of them
are violent.

23:53.452 --> 23:55.253
You know, we know it's a step
away from robbing someone

23:55.254 --> 23:56.921
and hurting them
at the same time.

23:56.922 --> 24:00.124
I think we should
go back to the wife, see if

24:00.125 --> 24:01.859
she can identify the suspect.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:01.860 --> 24:04.495
She said she didn't get a good look at the guy.
A statement she made

24:04.496 --> 24:06.197
a few hours after
her husband was shot.

24:06.198 --> 24:08.099
I think we should give her
another opportunity.

24:08.100 --> 24:09.667
Opportunity for what,
to-to make something up?

24:09.668 --> 24:11.919
She said she didn't get
a good look at the guy.

24:11.920 --> 24:14.038
To tell us whether
upon further reflection

24:14.039 --> 24:16.140
she can identify a suspect.

24:16.141 --> 24:18.109
Of course she can identify
the suspect <i>now.</i>

24:18.110 --> 24:20.244
His face is all over
the TV. Come...

24:20.245 --> 24:22.013
If she identifies
Pierre now, it's gonna

24:22.014 --> 24:23.614
have stink on it,
and you know it.

24:23.615 --> 24:25.716
Look, we have a visitor
to this city

24:25.717 --> 24:26.918
who in one moment is

24:26.919 --> 24:28.553
holding hands with
her husband across dinner

24:28.554 --> 24:29.987
and a few hours later,
he's dead.

24:29.988 --> 24:32.990
I think she should
have the chance,

24:32.991 --> 24:36.727
if she can, to put
the man responsible away.

24:36.728 --> 24:38.596
Okay.

24:43.602 --> 24:45.203
Doc.

24:45.204 --> 24:47.255
Got more questions?

24:47.256 --> 24:49.674
I have a favor to ask.

24:49.675 --> 24:51.843
I'm listening.

24:51.844 --> 24:55.129
I've misplaced my memo book,
uh, containing my notes

24:55.130 --> 24:57.014
from the homeless man scene.

24:58.183 --> 25:00.301
Did the dog eat
your homework, Officer?

25:00.302 --> 25:02.253
I wish. Um...

25:02.254 --> 25:03.554
it's gonna make me look

25:03.555 --> 25:05.623
like that big of a jerk
if I have to...

25:05.624 --> 25:07.658
ask my boss
to log me onto the system

25:07.659 --> 25:09.560
to get the information
for the reports.

25:09.561 --> 25:11.462
Yeah, that doesn't look good.

25:11.463 --> 25:13.131
No, it doesn't.

25:13.132 --> 25:15.566
So I was wondering if, um...

25:15.567 --> 25:16.868
if I'd log you in here?

25:16.869 --> 25:20.104
Makes you a hero and me just
a little bit less of a jerk.

25:20.105 --> 25:22.640
You're lucky I have
a soft spot for rookies.

25:22.641 --> 25:25.442
I owe you one.
Hm.

25:25.443 --> 25:28.129
Favor from a rook might
not mean much, but...

25:28.130 --> 25:31.299
Hey, you never know.

25:48.400 --> 25:50.401
♪ ♪

26:04.583 --> 26:06.717
You say he spoke
his mind; I say he

26:06.718 --> 26:07.885
shot himself in the foot.

26:07.886 --> 26:08.853
Then let's just agree

26:08.854 --> 26:09.954
to disagree, shall we?

26:09.955 --> 26:11.488
The mayor would appreciate

26:11.489 --> 26:12.823
a clarifying statement.

26:12.824 --> 26:14.492
Every reporter there
understood exactly

26:14.493 --> 26:16.194
what he was talking about--
there's nothing

26:16.195 --> 26:18.529
to clarify or rescind,
end of story.

26:18.530 --> 26:21.132
The mayor requested it,
end of story.

26:21.133 --> 26:22.867
Okay, here you go:
"The commissioner regrets

26:22.868 --> 26:24.602
"that in his statements
to the press

26:24.603 --> 26:26.504
"he didn't emphasize
the need for visitors

26:26.505 --> 26:29.707
"to exercise reasonable caution
in emerging neighborhoods

26:29.708 --> 26:32.276
"where the underprivileged
are being pushed out.

26:32.277 --> 26:34.712
Oh, here you go.
"Where a bodega that still

26:34.713 --> 26:37.582
"takes food stamps
sits next to a restaurant

26:37.583 --> 26:39.417
"that gets 50 bucks a plate

26:39.418 --> 26:41.519
for mac and cheese."
How's that?

26:41.520 --> 26:42.587
Okay. I give up.

26:42.588 --> 26:43.738
But the mayor won't.

26:43.739 --> 26:46.624
Thanks for dropping by.

26:48.794 --> 26:50.694
You're an idiot.
Thank you.

26:50.695 --> 26:53.965
She's right, you know.
No, I don't know.

26:53.966 --> 26:55.733
Your position won't be
compromised by embracing

26:55.734 --> 26:58.169
the fact that tourism
is good for New York City.

26:58.170 --> 27:00.137
Equating the murder
of a white, wealthy tourist

27:00.138 --> 27:02.707
to an old man mugged
in the Bronx...

27:02.708 --> 27:04.141
That is not what I said,
and you know it.

27:04.142 --> 27:05.509
I know it's how
it was perceived.

27:05.510 --> 27:07.545
Only by someone
who didn't bother to listen.

27:07.546 --> 27:08.846
The mayor listened!

27:08.847 --> 27:10.781
We're done here, Garrett.

27:19.858 --> 27:21.125
I'm Detective Reagan,
ma'am.

27:21.126 --> 27:22.560
This is, uh...

27:22.561 --> 27:25.129
Erin Boyle, with the Manhattan
District Attorney's Office.

27:25.130 --> 27:26.998
I'm Margaret's sister, Leslie.

27:26.999 --> 27:28.966
We were hoping to speak
to her if we could.

27:28.967 --> 27:32.837
Come on in. She's resting.

27:33.672 --> 27:35.406
This is my husband, Mark.

27:35.407 --> 27:38.626
And... I'm Carl Perry,
friend of the family.

27:38.627 --> 27:40.744
He was kind enough
to fly us here.

27:40.745 --> 27:43.264
I'll go get Margaret.

27:44.549 --> 27:45.750
So, uh...

27:45.751 --> 27:48.286
you two from Iowa also?

27:48.287 --> 27:50.755
Yeah. We're, um...

27:50.756 --> 27:53.474
we haven't had a murder
in my hometown

27:53.475 --> 27:55.226
for five years, Detective.

27:55.227 --> 27:58.479
You lure people here
with your glitzy advertising,

27:58.480 --> 27:59.864
and then put

27:59.865 --> 28:02.133
a fancy restaurant
in a hellhole...

28:02.134 --> 28:04.702
while the armed criminals
roam the streets.

28:04.703 --> 28:07.838
You guys just get in
or something?

28:07.839 --> 28:09.607
Yeah, this
morning, and, uh,

28:09.608 --> 28:12.843
we're just staying long enough
to get my brother-in-law's body

28:12.844 --> 28:15.713
and fly him back home.
All right, all right, Mark.

28:15.714 --> 28:17.465
Take it easy, all right?
They're here to help.

28:25.557 --> 28:27.391
How are you doing?

28:28.343 --> 28:30.161
I'm numb.

28:30.162 --> 28:33.164
Mrs. Olson,
we could use your help,

28:33.165 --> 28:34.465
if you're up to it.

28:34.466 --> 28:36.734
You said that you
didn't clearly see

28:36.735 --> 28:39.537
the face of the man who
was running from your husband

28:39.538 --> 28:41.739
after he was shot.

28:41.740 --> 28:44.041
Has anything come back to you?

28:44.042 --> 28:46.610
I don't think so.

28:46.611 --> 28:48.346
We'd like to put you

28:48.347 --> 28:51.148
in front of a lineup to see if
anything would jog your memory.

28:51.149 --> 28:54.051
They said that you
arrested somebody.

28:54.052 --> 28:56.253
Did you see any of that
on the news?

28:56.254 --> 28:59.690
No. I can't bear to watch it.

29:03.678 --> 29:07.264
Do you think you could
handle the lineup?

29:07.265 --> 29:11.469
I'll do anything to put
Lance's killer behind bars.

29:11.470 --> 29:13.020
Okay.

29:13.021 --> 29:14.472
Let's go.

29:16.208 --> 29:18.392
All right, I want
you to take a look

29:18.393 --> 29:20.061
at all the men in this lineup,

29:20.062 --> 29:22.580
tell me if you recognize
any one of them.

29:26.518 --> 29:27.852
Number five.

29:27.853 --> 29:29.987
Number five.
I recognize him.

29:29.988 --> 29:32.356
Okay, where do you
recognize number five from?

29:32.357 --> 29:34.925
That's the man I saw
running away from Lance

29:34.926 --> 29:36.394
after he was shot.

29:43.969 --> 29:45.636
She picked him.

29:45.637 --> 29:47.338
She got lucky.

29:47.339 --> 29:49.673
We have two independent
witnesses that corroborate.

29:49.674 --> 29:51.725
Come on, we just
served this guy up

29:51.726 --> 29:53.611
on a silver platter for her.
Well, then

29:53.612 --> 29:55.279
he'll have 20-to-life
to commiserate

29:55.280 --> 29:57.932
with all the other murderers
who insist they're innocent.

30:08.002 --> 30:09.686
But I read that eyewitness
testimonies are responsible

30:09.687 --> 30:11.238
for a lot of wrongful
convictions.

30:11.239 --> 30:12.940
Yeah, but that
cuts both ways.

30:12.941 --> 30:15.008
Sometimes it's the closest account
to what actually happened.

30:15.009 --> 30:17.211
And the best shot
at making your case.

30:17.212 --> 30:21.215
Jurors hear what happened
from a layperson, they perk up.

30:21.216 --> 30:23.450
Which is fine, Grandpa,
as long as the witness

30:23.451 --> 30:25.118
really saw what
they say they did.

30:25.119 --> 30:28.021
She lost her husband-- what
is she gonna gain by lying?

30:28.022 --> 30:29.790
I don't know.
But all I do know is,

30:29.791 --> 30:31.658
first she said
she didn't see a face,

30:31.659 --> 30:32.993
then suddenly she saw a face,

30:32.994 --> 30:35.295
and of course, it turns out
to be this guy All right.

30:35.296 --> 30:36.997
who's plastered
all over television.

30:36.998 --> 30:38.365
Oh, Mom let us watch TV

30:38.366 --> 30:40.834
when you arrested
that man.

30:40.835 --> 30:42.502
He looks like a bad guy.

30:42.503 --> 30:44.571
What do you mean, he looks
like a bad guy, sweetie?

30:44.572 --> 30:45.606
You know, scary.

30:45.607 --> 30:46.690
Boys, listen.

30:46.691 --> 30:49.342
We've all arrested guys--
bad guys

30:49.343 --> 30:51.411
and scary guys, okay?

30:51.412 --> 30:54.214
But you can't tell if a guy's bad
or not just by looking at him.

30:54.215 --> 30:55.866
I mean, we put a guy
in handcuffs

30:55.867 --> 30:57.985
and we walk him in front
of the news cameras,

30:57.986 --> 30:59.620
sometimes they
look very scary,

30:59.621 --> 31:01.955
and it's really just because
they're scared themselves.

31:01.956 --> 31:02.873
Oh.

31:02.874 --> 31:04.658
Dad, you want to
weigh in on this?

31:04.659 --> 31:06.493
Yes, I do.

31:06.494 --> 31:08.528
The lamb was perfect.

31:08.529 --> 31:10.247
Too bad they didn't have lamb

31:10.248 --> 31:12.132
at your press conference,
Francis.

31:13.167 --> 31:14.401
Whoa, Poppy.

31:14.402 --> 31:15.886
Just telling it like it is.

31:15.887 --> 31:17.871
For what it's worth, sis,
I think you're the one

31:17.872 --> 31:19.205
in the most difficult
position here.

31:19.206 --> 31:20.757
Oh, actually,
it's the Haitian guy

31:20.758 --> 31:23.543
who's in the worst position here.
I'm clearing.

31:34.055 --> 31:36.523
I like these cabinets;
they're original to the house.

31:36.524 --> 31:37.557
Cool it.

31:37.558 --> 31:40.027
I know you two are supposed

31:40.028 --> 31:42.562
to be all grown up,
but humor me here.

31:42.563 --> 31:44.564
Danny...

31:44.565 --> 31:47.668
what makes you think this guy is innocent?
I don't know if

31:47.669 --> 31:48.802
he's innocent, Dad--
I just think

31:48.803 --> 31:50.337
with all the pressure
on this case,

31:50.338 --> 31:51.938
the guy could use
a devil's advocate

31:51.939 --> 31:53.974
on the inside.
This guy gave us a clue

31:53.975 --> 31:55.842
that only a good cop
would know, Dad.

31:55.843 --> 31:57.844
Well, does that point you
towards another suspect?

31:57.845 --> 31:59.746
It opens the door
to the possibility

31:59.747 --> 32:01.915
that maybe this wasn't
just another street crime.

32:01.916 --> 32:03.383
Erin.

32:03.384 --> 32:05.285
He's got motive, opportunity.

32:05.286 --> 32:06.586
The wife puts him

32:06.587 --> 32:08.155
practically tripping
over the body.

32:08.156 --> 32:10.057
I don't know why Danny
wants to complicate this.

32:10.058 --> 32:12.592
And I don't know why you're so
hot for this guy. He's an ex-cop

32:12.593 --> 32:14.127
with a hard-luck story.

32:14.128 --> 32:16.029
Sympathize with him
all you want,

32:16.030 --> 32:17.331
just don't let it
cloud your judgment.

32:17.332 --> 32:18.098
I'm not.

32:18.099 --> 32:19.933
Yeah, you are.
Erin.

32:19.934 --> 32:21.868
You can't undo what
happened with Ian Boyd.

32:21.869 --> 32:23.103
I'm not...
Not with this case,

32:23.104 --> 32:24.871
not with any case.

32:26.441 --> 32:27.941
You think

32:27.942 --> 32:29.176
I'm rehashing that here?

32:29.177 --> 32:31.845
Two felony murders,
grieving relatives--

32:31.846 --> 32:33.347
you tell me.

32:42.457 --> 32:45.258
You're not gonna
back off of him, are you?

32:45.259 --> 32:48.295
If he's the guy, I want him
as bad as anybody else,

32:48.296 --> 32:49.763
including you.

32:49.764 --> 32:52.632
And if he's not,
I'd love some solid evidence.

32:52.633 --> 32:54.968
You'll get it, by the book.

32:56.838 --> 32:58.972
I'll hold off on the indictment.

33:01.609 --> 33:03.777
Well...

33:04.612 --> 33:07.313
You know, when Jamie was born,

33:07.314 --> 33:09.416
we tried to move you two
into the same room.

33:09.417 --> 33:10.617
You remember that?

33:10.618 --> 33:12.352
Sort of.

33:12.353 --> 33:13.453
Well, we couldn't
afford it,

33:13.454 --> 33:14.688
but the very next day,

33:14.689 --> 33:18.125
your mom and I started looking
for a bigger house.

33:21.129 --> 33:23.563
True story.

33:30.705 --> 33:31.671
Come on in.

33:31.672 --> 33:34.074
You wanted
to talk to me?

33:34.075 --> 33:38.345
We, uh, just wanted to tie up
a few loose ends, Mrs. Olson.

33:38.346 --> 33:39.529
Will this take long?

33:39.530 --> 33:44.351
I need to meet everybody
to sign the transfer permit

33:44.352 --> 33:46.920
so we can take
Lance's body home.

33:46.921 --> 33:50.574
You know, we're just looking
at this case from every angle,

33:50.575 --> 33:52.025
you know,
before we wrap it up.

33:52.026 --> 33:53.827
You see, all along,
we've looked

33:53.828 --> 33:55.862
at this as a crime
of opportunity,

33:55.863 --> 33:58.131
but we wanted
to at least consider the fact

33:58.132 --> 34:00.534
that maybe it wasn't random.

34:00.535 --> 34:02.536
What do you mean?

34:02.537 --> 34:05.172
Well, maybe somebody wanted
to harm your husband--

34:05.173 --> 34:07.407
business associate, an enemy?

34:07.408 --> 34:09.943
Lance doesn't have
any enemies.

34:09.944 --> 34:12.212
Hmm.
So, this morning
we revisited

34:12.213 --> 34:15.282
your husband's phone records,

34:15.283 --> 34:17.751
especially while he was here
in New York, but we decided

34:17.752 --> 34:19.553
to go back
a few months,

34:19.554 --> 34:23.223
and there's a lot of calls
to a, uh, Carl Perry.

34:23.224 --> 34:24.224
Carl?

34:24.225 --> 34:26.493
He and Lance
did business together.

34:27.695 --> 34:29.896
You're not suggesting he had
something to do with this?

34:29.897 --> 34:31.264
You know,
Mrs. Olson,

34:31.264 --> 34:34.333
this would be a really good time
for you to be frank with us.

34:34.335 --> 34:36.803
You see, when we accessed
Carl's phone records,

34:36.804 --> 34:38.038
we noticed a
lot of calls

34:38.039 --> 34:39.672
to your home

34:39.674 --> 34:42.375
at times that your husband's
calendar show he wasn't there.

34:42.376 --> 34:45.411
And your credit card
records show three weekends

34:45.413 --> 34:48.514
at a Hotel Mandolin--
pretty romantic place,

34:48.516 --> 34:51.016
and you weren't
with your husband.

34:51.018 --> 34:52.152
We have the
hotel confirming

34:52.152 --> 34:54.621
right now that you were
actually with Carl.

34:54.621 --> 34:58.091
You want
to talk about it,

34:58.092 --> 34:59.926
Mrs. Olson?

35:03.064 --> 35:06.900
My husband was away so much,

35:06.901 --> 35:10.070
so consumed by his work,

35:10.071 --> 35:12.172
and Carl...

35:12.173 --> 35:14.541
he thought
he was in love with me.

35:15.977 --> 35:17.210
It was so wrong

35:17.211 --> 35:20.747
and-and stupid,
but I broke it off

35:20.748 --> 35:23.116
and I swore to myself
I'd make it up to Lance.

35:23.117 --> 35:25.252
That's what this trip was about.

35:25.253 --> 35:29.089
I asked you
before,

35:29.090 --> 35:33.159
do you really think Carl
could do something like this?

35:33.160 --> 35:35.095
No, it's impossible.

35:35.096 --> 35:36.196
Well,

35:36.197 --> 35:38.965
jealousy is a strong motive,
Mrs. Olson.

35:38.966 --> 35:42.168
You never really know
what someone is capable of.

35:47.642 --> 35:49.209
Thanks very much for coming.

35:49.210 --> 35:51.361
Come with me.

36:00.338 --> 36:01.487
What's up?
Is he sweating?

36:01.488 --> 36:02.706
Well, he's trying
not to show it.

36:02.707 --> 36:04.157
You get anything useful
out of her?

36:04.158 --> 36:07.193
Well, they met at a dinner
for Lance's biofuel investors.

36:07.194 --> 36:09.763
Apparently there was a spark
she just couldn't ignore,

36:09.764 --> 36:12.215
and then at that Hotel Mandolin,
where the two of them

36:12.216 --> 36:14.034
Yeah, yeah.
were canoodling last year,

36:14.035 --> 36:15.468
she learned that
Carl was a junkie

36:15.469 --> 36:17.370
for champagne and
breakfast in bed

36:17.371 --> 36:20.223
and, uh, partial to bacon,
extra, extra crispy.

36:20.224 --> 36:22.075
All right, let's see
if we can use it.

36:22.076 --> 36:23.343
Mm-hmm.

36:23.344 --> 36:25.612
This list of Lance's
business associates

36:25.613 --> 36:26.863
will be very helpful.
Thank you.

36:26.864 --> 36:28.014
You're welcome.

36:28.015 --> 36:30.233
One other thing.

36:30.234 --> 36:31.885
You're a pilot. I
mean, you pilots--

36:31.886 --> 36:34.454
y-you prepare for
emergencies, right?

36:34.455 --> 36:36.239
You do, like,
dry runs.

36:36.240 --> 36:37.524
You don't want anything
to happen

36:37.525 --> 36:38.825
that you're not prepared for.

36:38.826 --> 36:41.461
Right, so hypothetically if
you wanted to kill someone,

36:41.462 --> 36:43.263
say someone like Lance,
you'd probably do

36:43.264 --> 36:44.831
a dry run, wouldn't you?

36:44.832 --> 36:46.900
What are you saying?

36:46.901 --> 36:48.134
Well...
No, this is crazy.

36:48.135 --> 36:49.636
I don't have to hear this.

36:49.637 --> 36:51.204
You're going to
hear everything

36:51.205 --> 36:53.206
I got to say.

36:53.207 --> 36:55.041
Why would I kill Lance?

36:55.042 --> 36:56.810
Because you love his wife.

36:56.811 --> 37:00.113
That's what Margaret's telling
my partner in the other room.

37:00.114 --> 37:02.582
In fact, she's saying a whole
lot of things about you.

37:02.583 --> 37:05.318
Let's see, she's talking
about the Mandolin Hotel

37:05.319 --> 37:07.520
and champagne,
breakfast in bed,

37:07.521 --> 37:09.272
and how you like
crispy bacon

37:09.273 --> 37:13.226
and, uh, yeah, talking
about the dry run you did.

37:16.063 --> 37:18.198
Here's a receipt.

37:18.199 --> 37:19.899
It's your receipt
from one month ago--

37:19.900 --> 37:21.401
the same restaurant
where Lance was killed.

37:21.402 --> 37:23.570
Imagine that.

37:23.571 --> 37:25.438
I came to N-New York
on a business deal

37:25.439 --> 37:27.607
and I met with Ray Lawrence
and we went to dinner.

37:27.608 --> 37:28.742
Why don't you ask him about it?

37:28.743 --> 37:29.709
I did.

37:29.710 --> 37:31.111
He said you chose
the restaurant.

37:31.112 --> 37:32.445
I don't know
where to eat around here.

37:32.446 --> 37:33.880
He suggested a few places
and we decided on this one.

37:33.881 --> 37:34.914
So how about
the waiter--

37:34.915 --> 37:36.916
the waiter who you asked

37:36.917 --> 37:38.968
where somebody would go
if they wanted to smoke?

37:38.969 --> 37:40.120
Lance smoked, didn't he?

37:40.121 --> 37:41.321
So I come from Iowa to New York

37:41.322 --> 37:44.124
and I eat at the same restaurant
and I have a smoke.

37:44.125 --> 37:45.442
What's that prove?

37:45.443 --> 37:47.477
I'll tell you what it proves.

37:47.478 --> 37:49.562
It proves everything
that Margaret is saying--

37:49.563 --> 37:50.964
that you wanted to be with her

37:50.965 --> 37:53.500
and you wanted to have
Lance's money, too.

37:55.302 --> 37:57.437
I know
what you're trying to do.

37:57.438 --> 37:59.372
Do you?

37:59.373 --> 38:01.441
How's it going in here?

38:01.442 --> 38:03.543
Well, that's up to Carl here.

38:03.544 --> 38:06.146
You got a big decision
to make, Carl.

38:06.147 --> 38:07.681
Your girlfriend's in there

38:07.682 --> 38:09.115
saying that you planned
the whole thing

38:09.116 --> 38:10.850
and she begged you
not to go through with it.

38:10.851 --> 38:12.686
Isn't that her story, Detective?
In a nutshell, yeah.

38:12.687 --> 38:13.853
She's very convincing.

38:13.854 --> 38:16.222
Oh, yeah, she had
to be convincing.

38:16.223 --> 38:18.825
I mean, she convinced you
to kill her husband and she

38:18.826 --> 38:20.460
convinced two seasoned
detectives that her sob story

38:20.461 --> 38:22.162
was true.

38:22.163 --> 38:24.397
It'd be a real
shame if she pulled

38:24.398 --> 38:26.566
this one over on you, too, Carl.

38:26.567 --> 38:29.152
You're lying to me.

38:29.153 --> 38:30.904
You're trying to manipulate me.

38:32.239 --> 38:35.108
Okay, so Margaret gets
her freedom and Lance's money,

38:35.109 --> 38:37.277
and you get 25 to life.

38:38.045 --> 38:40.080
Unless, of
course, you got

38:40.081 --> 38:43.349
some information that
contradicts her story

38:43.350 --> 38:45.018
'cause we could
just recommend

38:45.019 --> 38:47.087
that you're the one
that gets the deal here.

38:54.545 --> 38:56.513
I really need to get back
to the hotel.

38:56.514 --> 38:57.597
No, you really
need to sit down

38:57.598 --> 38:59.399
for what we have
to say to you.

38:59.400 --> 39:00.800
Sit down.

39:02.903 --> 39:04.204
Your boyfriend Carl
has been chatting it up

39:04.205 --> 39:05.772
in the other room.

39:05.773 --> 39:07.807
He just confessed
to shooting Lance.

39:09.643 --> 39:12.011
Oh, my God.

39:12.012 --> 39:13.613
Carl shot Lance?

39:13.614 --> 39:14.981
Why?

39:16.417 --> 39:17.367
She's good, huh?

39:19.570 --> 39:20.787
Remember this?

39:20.788 --> 39:22.055
You recognize it?

39:22.056 --> 39:24.157
It's Carl's phone.

39:24.158 --> 39:25.759
Wow, that's the first
honest thing you've said.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.026
What about this?

39:27.027 --> 39:29.362
You recognize this?

39:29.363 --> 39:30.530
MARGARET
It's done, babe.

39:30.531 --> 39:32.365
You'll fly my sister here,

39:32.366 --> 39:35.568
everyone will feel
so sorry for me,

39:35.569 --> 39:38.138
and then we'll be home free.

39:40.174 --> 39:43.109
That isn't what it sounds like.

39:43.110 --> 39:44.444
Sure, it is-- it's your voice,

39:44.445 --> 39:46.112
and there's plenty more
where that came from.

39:46.113 --> 39:48.081
You traded
in Lance for Carl,

39:48.082 --> 39:51.184
except Carl--
he had an ace in the hole.

39:51.185 --> 39:53.686
He kept a few choice messages
of yours.

39:53.687 --> 39:57.423
All that happy anticipation
about spending Lance's money,

39:57.424 --> 39:59.526
just without Lance.

39:59.527 --> 40:03.630
You know... I really hate
when people do bad things

40:03.631 --> 40:05.799
and blame it on my city.

40:07.234 --> 40:09.235
I want a lawyer.

40:09.236 --> 40:11.571
That's the second honest thing
you've said.

40:12.439 --> 40:14.908
Get me a lawyer!

40:45.539 --> 40:47.707
Just needs your signature.

40:49.743 --> 40:51.444
"For immediate release.

40:51.445 --> 40:54.180
"The police commissioner today
reluctantly announces

40:54.181 --> 40:56.249
the unexpected resignation..."

40:56.250 --> 40:58.218
Long planned resignation.

40:59.970 --> 41:03.389
"...long planned resignation
of Deputy Commissioner

41:03.390 --> 41:05.491
of Public Information
Garrett Moore."

41:05.492 --> 41:07.660
I know what it says.

41:08.896 --> 41:12.031
I particularly like
the part right here

41:12.032 --> 41:13.633
about

41:13.634 --> 41:15.802
"exploring
new avenues."

41:15.803 --> 41:19.239
Makes unemployment sound...
exciting.

41:19.240 --> 41:21.708
Glad you approve.

41:24.378 --> 41:27.830
"Signed, Frank Reagan,
Commissioner."

41:27.831 --> 41:32.051
All in all,
much better than the last one.

41:32.052 --> 41:33.486
Do you have a pen?

41:40.594 --> 41:42.328
It pains me

41:42.329 --> 41:45.064
to do this, I want you to know.

41:50.037 --> 41:52.839
Patrick.

41:52.840 --> 41:54.974
Duignan neat,
water back,

41:54.975 --> 41:56.809
on my pal here.

41:56.810 --> 41:59.078
You cheap bastard,
on my salary?

41:59.079 --> 42:02.181
At least you still got one.

42:14.695 --> 42:16.796
Oldest story in the book,
you know.

42:16.797 --> 42:18.264
The lovers

42:18.265 --> 42:19.865
kill the husband for his money.

42:19.866 --> 42:21.834
You came here to gloat?

42:21.835 --> 42:24.304
Well, I could.

42:24.305 --> 42:26.072
That'd make me
a lousy brother, though.

42:26.073 --> 42:28.374
On the other hand,
if I came to tell you that

42:28.375 --> 42:29.609
Nicky was with Linda
and the boys

42:29.610 --> 42:33.479
and I got us a corner table
at Chops, well...

42:40.087 --> 42:43.089
I could use a scotch
and a steak.

42:44.942 --> 42:47.493
I figured you could.

42:50.447 --> 42:52.799
Since I kicked your ass
this time.
