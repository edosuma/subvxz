10:40.244 --> 10:42.243
You getting
some bad vibes again?

10:42.244 --> 10:44.243
- I-I think

10:44.244 --> 10:47.243
something's watching us.

10:47.244 --> 10:50.244
Come on.
Let's keep moving.

I don't know, d.

10:58.244 --> 10:59.243
You think he got lost?

10:59.244 --> 11:01.243
Maybe he got eaten
by a rabid squirrel.

11:01.244 --> 11:03.243
- I do not think that, no.

11:03.244 --> 11:07.243
I'm just freaking because Casey
and April went off on their own.

11:07.244 --> 11:08.243
Alone.

11:08.244 --> 11:09.243
- Why?

11:09.244 --> 11:11.243
Because they forgot to bring
a compass?

11:11.244 --> 11:13.243
- No, genius.

11:13.244 --> 11:15.243
What happens when two teenagers
who like each other

infected him.

sucked out your mutagen

and turned you
into a plant, dude.

20:53.130 --> 20:55.129
It was awesome!
