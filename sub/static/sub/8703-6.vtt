00:34.703 --> 00:36.785
Come on. This way, please.

00:36.805 --> 00:38.653
Whoa. Right there.

00:38.673 --> 00:40.742
Quickly. Right this way.

00:43.678 --> 00:45.326
Take the family to Nurse Obar.

00:45.346 --> 00:46.427
Watch this.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.429
Okay. Thank you. Cuidado.

00:48.449 --> 00:49.884
Okay.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.104
Whoa! Who's taking
my damn picture?

00:56.124 --> 00:57.338
- It's just procedure.
- Procedure of what?

00:57.358 --> 00:59.073
Okay, headache, back pains,

00:59.093 --> 01:00.474
- stomach ache, rash... anyone?
- Are you the doctor?

01:00.494 --> 01:01.843
- What is this place?
- Quarantine.

01:01.863 --> 01:04.613
You have entered
a variola smallpox zone.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.881
- Smallpox?
- We barely left the dock.

01:06.901 --> 01:09.350
We couldn't have entered
an infected zone.

01:09.370 --> 01:10.852
Wait. Guatemala has smallpox?

01:10.872 --> 01:12.821
We're trying to stop it
from reaching Guatemala.

01:12.841 --> 01:15.189
Our boats brought you back to Belize.

01:15.209 --> 01:16.958
I thought smallpox was eradicated.

01:16.978 --> 01:18.760
Yeah. Isn't it like extinct?

01:18.780 --> 01:20.061
Tell that to the Chief of Staff.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.997
So we must take your blood samples

01:23.017 --> 01:25.667
because you were
in an infection zone.

01:25.687 --> 01:27.669
- You're very lucky.
- How's that?

01:27.689 --> 01:29.237
Because if you have it,

01:29.257 --> 01:31.305
there is still a chance
that we can save your lives.

01:31.325 --> 01:33.341
But more importantly, if you have it,

01:33.361 --> 01:36.064
by being here, you are
saving the lives of others.

01:40.468 --> 01:41.970
What's that for?

01:43.905 --> 01:46.320
Why is mine a different color?

01:46.340 --> 01:47.756
What kind of doctor are you?

01:47.776 --> 01:49.858
- I am a nurse.
- So where are the doctors?

01:49.878 --> 01:51.159
They're very busy.
So are we.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.981
Go. Go, go, go.

01:58.687 --> 02:01.089
Please follow the light.

02:05.426 --> 02:08.830
If you have not been processed,
please stay in line.

02:13.234 --> 02:14.335
Fuck.

02:16.204 --> 02:19.020
That little yellow
vaccine book the doctor gave me

02:19.040 --> 02:20.254
is back at the villa.

02:20.274 --> 02:21.723
You got vaccine shots?

02:21.743 --> 02:23.024
Yeah. I think
that smallpox was one of

02:23.044 --> 02:24.458
the shots I got.
It must have been.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.427
Joel, was smallpox
one of the shots you got?

02:26.447 --> 02:27.896
I don't remember.

02:27.916 --> 02:29.397
Were we supposed to get shots?
Did you get shots?

02:29.417 --> 02:31.900
I can't do needles, man.
I took herbal drops.

02:31.920 --> 02:33.434
Milo never said
I needed shots or drops.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.003
Dude, you always get shots.

02:35.023 --> 02:37.005
Haven't you ever been to
a tropical island before?

02:37.025 --> 02:38.339
It's not an island.

02:38.359 --> 02:39.841
But when you're a kid,

02:39.861 --> 02:41.776
isn't smallpox one
of the shots they give you?

02:41.796 --> 02:43.712
That's right.
The mark that you get.

02:43.732 --> 02:45.013
That's like the all-purpose

02:45.033 --> 02:47.481
singing and dancing
vaccination deal, right?

02:47.501 --> 02:48.983
That one? Is that it?

02:49.003 --> 02:50.284
- What? Like that?
- Where?

02:50.304 --> 02:51.820
- That mark?
- Right here. Right here.

02:51.840 --> 02:53.321
That's a mark.
That's a mark.

02:53.341 --> 02:54.622
I got that mark, too.

02:54.642 --> 02:55.890
I'm like double protected then.

02:55.910 --> 02:57.726
- Dude, that's a mole.
- What?

02:57.746 --> 02:59.327
- That's a mole.
- You gotta get that checked, bro.

02:59.347 --> 03:01.429
No, not that.
That's a birthmark.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.965
It doesn't matter.
Smallpox has mutated,

03:03.985 --> 03:06.167
and there's no vaccine.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.922
Come with me.

03:20.634 --> 03:22.416
Where are you from?

03:22.436 --> 03:25.319
Like, around here?
Belize, Belize City?

03:25.339 --> 03:28.389
Originally,
I am from Chile. Why?

03:28.409 --> 03:30.591
Just curious.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.260
Um, don't touch that.

03:32.280 --> 03:34.362
That-that... that belongs
to all of us,

03:34.382 --> 03:35.930
so I'll just put all our names on it.

03:35.950 --> 03:37.899
We can only put one name per item.

03:37.919 --> 03:39.200
- Why?
- Because if you have

03:39.220 --> 03:40.769
something of value in there

03:40.789 --> 03:42.570
and not all of you are released,

03:42.590 --> 03:43.772
then you cannot get it back.

03:43.792 --> 03:45.840
So I will write your name on it.

03:45.860 --> 03:48.362
Okay, well, forget it.
Don't worry about it.

03:49.931 --> 03:52.914
We have a pastor
who comes in the mornings

03:52.934 --> 03:54.816
if you would like to speak to him.

03:54.836 --> 03:56.384
A pastor? What?

03:56.404 --> 03:58.206
No. Fuck, no.

04:01.810 --> 04:03.311
Please fill these out.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.360
I really do need to use the phone.

04:06.380 --> 04:09.831
We have a pastor
who visits every morning.

04:09.851 --> 04:13.134
Oh, no, thanks.

04:13.154 --> 04:15.269
I'm... I'm not religious.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.038
No?

04:17.058 --> 04:19.373
Why did you say it like that?

04:19.392 --> 04:22.130
Because you look like a guy
who has a lot on his mind.

04:38.512 --> 04:39.828
Why do you have to do that?

04:39.848 --> 04:41.262
Random sample.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.531
And you picked me because...

04:43.551 --> 04:44.933
Every 50th patient.

04:44.953 --> 04:46.700
Where does that sample go?

04:46.720 --> 04:49.203
Clinic. You know? Yeah?

04:49.223 --> 04:52.340
Anonymous.
No records, just data.

04:52.360 --> 04:58.146
Andre, the father of the twins
that came in with us...

04:58.166 --> 04:59.413
Mm-hmm?

04:59.433 --> 05:02.350
He sneezed on me.

05:02.370 --> 05:03.985
Is he sick?

05:04.005 --> 05:07.055
He sneezed on just you
or also your friends?

05:07.075 --> 05:08.857
Just me, I think.

05:08.877 --> 05:10.691
I'll tell the doctor.

05:10.711 --> 05:12.126
Well, can I tell the doctor?

05:12.146 --> 05:14.362
I mean, when do I get
to see an actual doctor?

05:14.382 --> 05:16.564
- If you have smallpox...
- Uh-huh.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.266
...then you see a doctor.

05:18.286 --> 05:20.534
So you really don't want to see her.

05:20.554 --> 05:21.903
- Sir?
- No.

05:21.923 --> 05:23.504
- I am cooperating with you.
- Sir?

05:23.524 --> 05:25.406
- You are not cooperating...
- I tried to explain to him.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.876
Listen, I have two girls,
and I need to use a phone.

05:27.896 --> 05:30.879
We understand.
You need to lower your volume to a calm level.

05:30.899 --> 05:33.982
- I need to use a phone.
- You cannot call when in quarantine.

05:34.002 --> 05:35.749
- Why?
- It can cause a panic.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.685
Do you have kids?

05:37.705 --> 05:39.407
Not anymore.

05:40.942 --> 05:43.892
We have a pastor
who visits in the mornings

05:43.912 --> 05:46.227
if you would like to speak to him.

05:46.247 --> 05:48.029
Does that pastor have a roaming plan?

05:48.049 --> 05:50.231
I must know where you have been

05:50.251 --> 05:52.233
and who you have met with.

05:52.253 --> 05:53.801
Here in Belize, where do you stay?

05:53.821 --> 05:55.169
Belize City.

05:55.189 --> 05:57.238
- Hotel name?
- No, uh, with a friend.

05:57.258 --> 05:59.173
Well, we will need to contact them.

05:59.193 --> 06:00.341
Please write their number.

06:00.361 --> 06:01.509
Uh, he... our friend's gone.

06:01.529 --> 06:04.312
- Where?
- Well, he's just gone.

06:04.332 --> 06:06.180
Uh, he went to Guatemala.

06:06.200 --> 06:08.416
Do you have a contact number for him?

06:08.436 --> 06:11.252
- Sure.
- How did you get to the boat we found you on?

06:11.272 --> 06:13.054
We hitchhiked from Belize City.

06:13.074 --> 06:15.123
Hitchhiked?
No, that's not correct.

06:15.143 --> 06:16.657
I don't care what happens.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.192
I gotta tell you the truth.

06:18.212 --> 06:20.929
We got a ride from
a woman who worked at...

06:20.949 --> 06:24.232
She was driving us
to Guatemala. She died.

06:24.252 --> 06:25.833
- She's dead?
- Yes.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.135
She was sick?
What were her symptoms?

06:27.155 --> 06:30.138
She fell. She fell
into a very deep chasm.

06:30.158 --> 06:31.572
I'm pretty sure she's dead.

06:31.592 --> 06:32.941
So you're not sure?

06:32.961 --> 06:34.308
We didn't go down there to look.

06:34.328 --> 06:35.776
I mean, we should have,
but we couldn't

06:35.796 --> 06:37.245
because it was very deep.

06:37.265 --> 06:39.380
But, no, she's-she's...
she's not alive.

06:39.400 --> 06:41.415
So this was close
to where we pick you up?

06:41.435 --> 06:43.517
- Yes.
- Did she complain of dizziness?

06:43.537 --> 06:44.518
No.

06:44.538 --> 06:45.586
Then how did she fall?

06:45.606 --> 06:47.388
I don't know.
Maybe she slipped.

06:47.408 --> 06:50.724
There were all these goats that...

06:50.744 --> 06:52.626
She's still down there.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.095
Do you understand that?

06:54.115 --> 06:56.064
Somebody's gotta go and get her body.

06:56.084 --> 06:58.599
I have medical authority
only, not police.

06:58.619 --> 07:01.302
Okay. Call it
a medical emergency.

07:01.322 --> 07:03.137
Just get somebody to go down there.

07:03.157 --> 07:05.439
I can only worry
about smallpox for now.

07:05.459 --> 07:08.442
We have a pastor
who visits in the morning

07:08.462 --> 07:10.244
if you would like to talk to him.

07:10.264 --> 07:13.734
Yeah, yeah, I would like that.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.706
* *

07:32.853 --> 07:35.403
- Did anyone see a doctor?
- No.

07:35.423 --> 07:37.038
You don't wanna see the doctor.

07:37.058 --> 07:39.073
- Why not?
- 'Cause that means you got it.

07:39.093 --> 07:40.808
That's ridiculous.
This is a hospital.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.410
They can't refuse to let... Oh!

07:42.430 --> 07:43.844
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- What the fuck is that thing?

07:43.864 --> 07:45.913
- What is it?
- Whoa!

07:45.933 --> 07:47.415
- Hey! Don't step on it!
- Why is it following me, man?

07:47.435 --> 07:49.017
- Don't step on it!
- Jesus Christ!

07:49.037 --> 07:50.184
- No! I'm not gonna touch it.
- Oh, shit!

07:50.204 --> 07:51.652
- You fucking touch it.
- Fuck!

07:51.672 --> 07:53.721
- Don't crush him!
- Watch his tail. Watch his tail.

07:53.741 --> 07:55.423
Hold on, hold on! Oh, yeah!

07:55.443 --> 07:57.558
Come on, get the tarp!
Cover him up! Cover it!

07:57.578 --> 07:59.127
Good, good, good.

07:59.147 --> 08:01.895
- Jesus Christ.
- If we're supposed to be

08:01.915 --> 08:03.497
hermetically sealed off
from the germs,

08:03.517 --> 08:05.366
how the fuck did that get in here?

08:05.386 --> 08:08.436
More to the point,
how do we get outta here?

08:08.456 --> 08:10.071
Well, why would you want to get out?

08:10.091 --> 08:11.605
If you have the disease,
they can treat you.

08:11.625 --> 08:13.507
- We don't have it.
- We don't know that.

08:13.527 --> 08:16.644
What if Jesús finds out we're
in here with all his money?

08:16.664 --> 08:19.347
- How's he gonna find out?
- He's got connections.

08:19.367 --> 08:20.948
You heard what Rochelle said.

08:20.968 --> 08:23.404
- The staff aren't local.
- Yeah, but the patients are.

08:25.639 --> 08:28.289
Hi. Hi.

08:28.309 --> 08:32.080
Have you seen our father?
Our uncle?

08:34.347 --> 08:38.131
No, no. You okay?

08:38.152 --> 08:39.366
We don't know where they are.

08:39.386 --> 08:40.967
My sister's scared.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.636
Yeah. Yeah, I bet.

08:43.657 --> 08:45.873
Um...

08:45.893 --> 08:47.975
Has your dad been sick?

08:47.995 --> 08:49.943
No.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.480
Has your uncle been sick?

08:52.500 --> 08:53.501
No.

08:57.271 --> 09:02.710
Hey, everything's gonna be okay.

09:18.992 --> 09:22.763
**

09:44.518 --> 09:49.403
You know, we're
officially missing now.

09:49.423 --> 09:53.341
We were supposed to land
in the U.S. 12 hours ago.

09:53.361 --> 09:54.642
We have to call home.

09:54.662 --> 09:56.277
They won't let us call out.

09:56.297 --> 09:59.280
Apparently, our voices
can cause mass panic.

09:59.300 --> 10:00.881
We can't just sit here.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.083
Hey, what if we bribe someone?

10:03.103 --> 10:04.418
Everybody's got a price.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.086
You do realize
that everyone working here

10:06.106 --> 10:07.488
is a volunteer, right?

10:07.508 --> 10:09.157
They're putting their lives
on the line.

10:09.177 --> 10:10.358
Not everyone in the world

10:10.378 --> 10:12.360
is motivated by
the same things you are.

10:12.380 --> 10:14.262
Okay, why do we keep
listening to him?

10:14.282 --> 10:16.430
Hey, don't lay this at my feet.

10:16.450 --> 10:17.898
- Keep the money?
- Hey, we agreed.

10:17.918 --> 10:19.433
- No, we didn't.
- We took a vote.

10:19.453 --> 10:21.535
What vote? Was there a vote?
What vote?

10:21.555 --> 10:23.357
What if we actually have it?

10:25.226 --> 10:27.461
Smallpox.

10:29.630 --> 10:32.079
Then I guess it wouldn't matter
how much money we have, huh?

10:32.099 --> 10:34.815
Fuck.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.251
You ask me, we deserve to have it.

10:37.271 --> 10:40.554
Have it or not, I'm getting home.

10:40.574 --> 10:42.690
We brought this on ourselves.

10:42.710 --> 10:45.213
Can we stop with the commentary, Lex?

10:52.220 --> 10:55.556
Hey, what's going on?
They okay?

11:00.228 --> 11:02.876
What's happening?

11:02.896 --> 11:04.111
- Hey!

11:04.131 --> 11:05.633
What's going on?

11:11.805 --> 11:14.242
* *

11:25.953 --> 11:27.888
Whoa, whoa.

11:35.429 --> 11:37.511
Oh, the black orchids.
You found them.

11:37.531 --> 11:40.481
Unfortunately, we are still looking.

11:40.501 --> 11:42.316
But I was told you are seeking

11:42.336 --> 11:44.952
the whereabouts of four Americans.

11:44.972 --> 11:46.720
And you offer payment for this?

11:46.740 --> 11:47.788
Where are they?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.557
My cousin's wife

11:49.577 --> 11:52.059
laid eyes on them
in the village yesterday.

11:52.079 --> 11:53.394
Are they there now?

11:53.414 --> 11:56.650
I only have the information
I gave you.

11:57.851 --> 11:59.667
Well, you could have
told me this yesterday.

11:59.687 --> 12:02.270
How many times have I told you
to get a telephone?

12:02.290 --> 12:05.473
It brings gossip, bickering.

12:05.493 --> 12:07.575
Amongst the wives
two years ago...

12:07.595 --> 12:09.830
Oh, for God's sake, Abram.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.581
And my payment for this information?

12:13.601 --> 12:15.649
Half now, and when you buy a phone,

12:15.669 --> 12:17.905
I'll call you to arrange
delivery of the rest.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.324
Hey, hey!

12:37.425 --> 12:38.972
Don't touch it.

12:38.992 --> 12:41.975
Why? Did you name it?

12:41.995 --> 12:43.544
Don't touch the fucking lizard.

12:43.564 --> 12:45.346
Well, this is a quarantine zone,

12:45.366 --> 12:47.114
and animals carry diseases.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.216
Cobi, I swear to God,

12:49.236 --> 12:51.372
if you touch that fucking lizard...

12:53.206 --> 12:55.389
Sorry.

12:55.409 --> 12:57.678
Water!

13:03.351 --> 13:07.355
...agua, por favor!

13:08.922 --> 13:13.093
Jesus. Is anybody
gonna help her?

13:14.227 --> 13:16.777
Agua, por favor.

13:16.797 --> 13:20.368
Hey! Can somebody
please get her some water?

13:23.471 --> 13:26.374
Necesito agua.

13:31.244 --> 13:32.960
Agua.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.762
Joel?

13:34.782 --> 13:36.750
Joel, what are you doing?

13:37.518 --> 13:38.819
- Um...
- Hey.

13:39.887 --> 13:43.837
Joel, what are you doing?
Joel!

13:43.857 --> 13:46.807
- What?
- Yo necesito agua.

13:46.827 --> 13:49.009
- What the fuck are you do...
- Joel... Hey!

13:49.029 --> 13:50.931
Hey! You're letting in
all the germs!

13:51.999 --> 13:53.581
Agua.

13:53.601 --> 13:55.749
- Justnot seeing it.
- Where'd he go?

13:55.769 --> 13:57.785
PTSD.
That's where he went.

13:57.805 --> 13:58.852
Oh, please.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.988
The rest of us are handling it okay.

14:01.008 --> 14:03.023
Yeah. How do you think
you'd act if you shot a cop?

14:03.043 --> 14:05.746
Will you please stop
saying that so loud?

14:09.216 --> 14:11.532
We can't let him back in.

14:11.552 --> 14:13.901
He might be contaminated.

14:13.921 --> 14:16.069
- She sounded really sick.
- Here he comes.

14:16.089 --> 14:19.172
- No, no, no, no.
- Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, Joel, Joel.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.876
Uh, go to the nurse and ask her
if you're at risk.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.745
- I'm not at risk.
- You don't know that.

14:24.765 --> 14:26.279
Just go find the nurse and ask.

14:26.299 --> 14:27.948
- Just ask, please.
- Yeah.

14:27.968 --> 14:30.718
- Dude, whoa!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

14:30.738 --> 14:32.420
What, are you that selfish?

14:32.440 --> 14:33.687
Just go find the damn nurse!

14:33.707 --> 14:35.423
- Joel, quit it!
- What do you wanna...

14:35.443 --> 14:37.491
Whoa. Jesus.

14:37.511 --> 14:41.849
Jesus Christ. Fucker!

14:44.985 --> 14:47.668
We were all brought in
together in a line, remember?

14:47.688 --> 14:49.169
She was in the line.

14:49.189 --> 14:53.306
So if we were gonna be infected,
we'd be infected.

14:53.326 --> 14:55.563
So chill the fuck out!

15:05.305 --> 15:09.857
What? I went out and gave water
to a woman that was coughing.

15:09.877 --> 15:11.759
You will be charged for this door.

15:11.779 --> 15:13.260
- Great.

15:13.280 --> 15:14.695
Hey, is there any chance

15:14.715 --> 15:17.164
that he could have been contaminated?

15:17.184 --> 15:19.299
No. She has TB.

15:19.319 --> 15:20.868
- Oh, great.
- Very nice.

15:20.888 --> 15:22.736
- You fucking dick. Thanks, man.
- Thank you.

15:22.756 --> 15:24.705
Well, you guys are okay.

15:24.725 --> 15:26.474
You all had inoculations as children.

15:26.494 --> 15:28.542
We saw the marks on your shoulder.

15:28.562 --> 15:30.277
So... so you have our results?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.312
I will discuss inside privately.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.747
But you have them?

15:33.767 --> 15:35.382
What happened to the twins
and their family?

15:35.402 --> 15:38.151
I cannot tell you about
another patient's results.

15:38.171 --> 15:40.020
Well, we know them.
They're kind of friends.

15:40.040 --> 15:41.722
It's against the rules.

15:41.742 --> 15:43.844
Well, fuck the rules.
Why don't you just tell us?

15:48.982 --> 15:52.299
We only have Joel Cranston's
results now.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.688
Please, can we talk?

16:05.633 --> 16:07.535
You are released.

16:19.012 --> 16:20.561
Congratulations.

16:20.581 --> 16:22.262
That's good.

16:22.282 --> 16:26.019
So, uh, what's the plan?

16:30.924 --> 16:32.560
Joel?

16:36.564 --> 16:38.011
Joel!

16:38.031 --> 16:40.413
Maybe you should take the luggage

16:40.433 --> 16:42.583
and we'll meet up with you.

16:42.603 --> 16:44.738
* *

16:52.746 --> 16:54.762
Our jeeps can take you to the shore

16:54.782 --> 16:56.296
for a boat back to Belize.

16:56.316 --> 16:58.231
Your friends' results
will come in soon.

16:58.251 --> 17:00.901
We have a waiting area
for you to wait outside.

17:00.921 --> 17:02.970
Thank you. Thanks.

17:02.990 --> 17:05.125
* *

17:30.818 --> 17:32.065
I'm worried about Joel.

17:32.085 --> 17:35.202
Why? He's the only one

17:35.222 --> 17:37.204
who definitely doesn't have smallpox.

17:37.224 --> 17:39.006
He's not, you know...

17:39.026 --> 17:42.342
He has a tendency
to go to darker places.

17:42.362 --> 17:44.411
Do I have to spell it out?

17:44.431 --> 17:45.879
The guy's a depressive.

17:45.899 --> 17:47.881
He's been through
something very traumatic.

17:47.901 --> 17:49.770
He's alone. I'm worried
what he might do to himself.

17:51.004 --> 17:53.173
Or what Jesús might do to him.

18:04.952 --> 18:07.855
This is Dr. Levine.

18:10.557 --> 18:12.926
Could we, please?

18:21.434 --> 18:25.753
I know that this is very
difficult news to tell you,

18:25.773 --> 18:28.041
but here's some results.

18:33.847 --> 18:35.528
I'm so sorry.

18:35.548 --> 18:37.250
Oh, my God.

18:43.590 --> 18:47.174
We have a great team of
doctors that can help you.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.329
Oh, God.

18:59.840 --> 19:01.789
That's not me.

19:01.809 --> 19:03.190
Oh, I'm so sorry.

19:03.210 --> 19:06.994
- Hey, wait.
- Uh, I'm so sorry.

19:07.014 --> 19:09.229
- Is that it?
- Mm-hmm.

19:09.249 --> 19:11.564
Okay. I'm okay.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.166
- Yes.
- You had the wrong person.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.302
- I'm so sorry.
- I-I'm released?

19:15.322 --> 19:17.004
Yes, but you have
a significant amount

19:17.024 --> 19:19.773
- of Valium in your sample.
- Oh, fuck that. Yes!

19:19.793 --> 19:21.208
Oh. All right.

19:21.228 --> 19:23.443
I'm released.
I'm okay, I'm okay.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.078
All right, good.

19:25.098 --> 19:28.448
Okay, okay. I'm gonna meet up
with, uh... with Joel.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.851
We're gonna wait
at the nearest bar, okay?

19:30.871 --> 19:33.854
And... assuming you get out,
which you will.

19:33.874 --> 19:35.756
- I know.
- So don't worry about it.

19:35.776 --> 19:38.258
Okay.

19:38.278 --> 19:39.893
This way?

19:39.913 --> 19:43.183
- Two more to go, man. Two more to go.
- Okay. Yeah, yeah.

19:44.785 --> 19:46.734
We have a waiting area outside.

19:46.754 --> 19:50.323
The vehicles can take you
to the shores for boats back to Belize.

20:01.268 --> 20:04.484
Uh, excuse me.
Any idea how long

20:04.504 --> 20:06.987
until my friends are released?

20:07.007 --> 20:08.889
There's no way of knowing.

20:08.909 --> 20:12.345
Minutes? Hours? Days?

20:22.890 --> 20:24.892
* *

21:03.163 --> 21:04.544
Mmm.

21:04.564 --> 21:09.883
Um, is there a hotel
or a hostel nearby?

21:09.903 --> 21:13.020
Barranco. It is far.

21:13.040 --> 21:15.522
Well, uh, can you give me
the number of a taxi?

21:15.542 --> 21:18.625
No taxi here.
I can give you a map.

21:18.645 --> 21:20.828
Well, how far is it?

21:20.848 --> 21:22.996
Five miles.

21:23.016 --> 21:25.953
Oh, uh, can I get that map, please?

22:18.906 --> 22:20.974
* *

22:24.277 --> 22:27.447
Ha ha!

22:31.718 --> 22:33.934
Uh, Barranco?

22:33.954 --> 22:35.923
Do you... do-do you know
where... where that is?

22:38.992 --> 22:43.376
N-No... no hablo español.
Uh...

22:43.396 --> 22:48.648
I-I'm trying to-to get
to, uh... Barranco, walking...

22:48.668 --> 22:51.671
No habla. Barranco.

22:54.607 --> 22:58.959
Yeah, sí, uh, and then you
show me the way to Barranco?

22:58.979 --> 23:00.160
Uh, Barranco?

23:00.180 --> 23:02.549
- Chido. Sí.
- Sí.

23:25.172 --> 23:27.287
Isabel, Mateo, Joel.

23:27.307 --> 23:29.122
- Isa... Isabel. Isabel.
- Isabel.

23:29.142 --> 23:30.958
- Uh, Joel.
- Joel.

23:30.978 --> 23:32.712
- Hola.
- Hola.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.329
- Mateo.
- Ma-Mateo.

23:36.349 --> 23:37.998
- Mateo. Mateo.
- Joel.

23:38.018 --> 23:40.153
Joel.

23:48.128 --> 23:50.410
You ready to get out of there?

23:50.430 --> 23:52.745
It's okay.

23:52.765 --> 23:54.234
All right.

23:56.503 --> 23:58.005
It's okay.

23:59.372 --> 24:02.255
At least we can save one life, right?

24:02.275 --> 24:05.392
Yeah. We can save a lizard,
but not Rochelle.

24:05.412 --> 24:09.296
But we could actually do
something about the lizard, Lex.

24:09.316 --> 24:10.998
Come on, man.
You have two daughters.

24:11.018 --> 24:12.299
How would you like it

24:12.319 --> 24:14.234
if somebody
left one of them in a ditch?

24:14.254 --> 24:15.768
You have no place

24:15.788 --> 24:17.670
to bring my daughters
in any conversation.

24:17.690 --> 24:20.293
Why? It's okay for Rochelle,
but not Talia or Reggie?

24:22.262 --> 24:24.031
What did you do for Rochelle?

24:26.699 --> 24:30.483
I was the one who kept saying
we gotta go down there.

24:30.503 --> 24:32.185
- We should call somebody.
- I heard you.

24:32.205 --> 24:33.553
- We can't leave her there.
- I heard you.

24:33.573 --> 24:35.355
- Did I? Yes!
- I heard you!

24:35.375 --> 24:36.889
- Did you?
- I tried.

24:36.909 --> 24:38.125
Nobody else gave a shit.

24:38.145 --> 24:39.226
- You tried? You tried?
- Yeah.

24:39.246 --> 24:40.360
I don't recall seeing your ass

24:40.380 --> 24:41.794
go down there and get her.

24:41.814 --> 24:43.130
Nobody stopped you.

24:43.150 --> 24:45.298
I don't even recall
you making a phone call.

24:45.318 --> 24:49.202
So how is that
everybody else's fault?

24:49.222 --> 24:51.771
Okay, you know what?
Fuck you.

24:51.791 --> 24:53.406
Congratulations on trying.

24:53.426 --> 24:54.674
Fuck you, because if it was your kid,

24:54.694 --> 24:55.942
we'd still be down there.

24:55.962 --> 24:57.277
Yeah, if it was my kid,
I wouldn't rely on you.

24:57.297 --> 24:58.911
No, no, I didn't say anything, right?

24:58.931 --> 25:02.135
- I didn't do anything. Whatever!
- Tried with your fucking mouth!

25:05.072 --> 25:06.606
You are clear.

25:08.575 --> 25:10.223
We have a waiting area outside,

25:10.243 --> 25:11.824
vehicles to drive you to the shore

25:11.844 --> 25:13.426
to take you back to Belize City.

25:13.446 --> 25:15.248
Thank you.

25:16.549 --> 25:18.731
Okay.

25:18.751 --> 25:20.120
Uh...

25:28.361 --> 25:30.263
Thank you.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.448
We need another blood sample.

25:35.468 --> 25:37.084
Why?

25:37.104 --> 25:39.086
The doctors requested it.

25:39.106 --> 25:40.287
What's wrong with my blood?

25:40.307 --> 25:42.089
Please, we must do this.

25:42.109 --> 25:44.411
Why do we need another...?

25:59.926 --> 26:02.395
* *

26:24.717 --> 26:27.534
Hey! Hey!

26:27.554 --> 26:28.821
You're okay!

27:01.254 --> 27:03.890
* *

27:18.638 --> 27:20.086
I understand you are responsible

27:20.106 --> 27:23.790
for the Americans who took
my money and my boat.

27:23.810 --> 27:27.480
I expect repayment immediately.

27:28.915 --> 27:32.585
How do I get a message back to Jesús?

27:36.689 --> 27:40.340
Uh, please tell him, with respect,

27:40.360 --> 27:42.209
he's mistaken,

27:42.229 --> 27:45.232
but I'll deal with it nonetheless.

27:58.311 --> 28:01.494
What's the quickest way to Guatemala?

28:01.514 --> 28:02.962
- The quickest?
- Mm-hmm.

28:02.982 --> 28:06.533
Where the smugglers
cross the river at Barranco.

28:06.553 --> 28:08.901
Well, how do I get there?

28:08.921 --> 28:10.637
You would have to walk.

28:10.657 --> 28:11.938
How far?

28:11.958 --> 28:13.893
Nine miles.

28:15.127 --> 28:17.630
* *

28:37.850 --> 28:40.567
Uh, I was wondering,

28:40.587 --> 28:44.404
uh, do you know where I could,
uh, get a taxi?

28:44.424 --> 28:46.439
Taxi gone...

28:46.459 --> 28:49.809
four years ago.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.944
You lost?

28:51.964 --> 28:55.748
Um...

28:55.768 --> 28:59.151
I'm just trying to get to Guatemala.

28:59.171 --> 29:01.788
Ya not look Guatemalan.

29:01.808 --> 29:03.456
I'm American.

29:03.476 --> 29:08.295
I'm just... just trying
to get home, that's all.

29:08.315 --> 29:10.930
My brother-in-law
coming home soon,

29:10.950 --> 29:12.765
and he can take you.

29:12.785 --> 29:15.368
Oh, really?

29:15.388 --> 29:17.737
That'd be great.

29:17.757 --> 29:21.027
You want some food while you wait?

29:27.900 --> 29:30.417
You really grew all this yourself?

29:30.437 --> 29:32.319
Of course.

29:32.339 --> 29:33.920
Hmm.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.055
We got a garden.

29:36.075 --> 29:39.992
But we don't grow anything
in it, just flowers.

29:40.012 --> 29:44.797
Hmm. Must you spend a lot
of money to buy food to cook.

29:44.817 --> 29:46.366
Um...

29:46.386 --> 29:49.021
we usually order, um, takeout.

29:51.558 --> 29:55.041
It's, like, you know, we...

29:55.061 --> 29:56.676
we order in.

29:56.696 --> 30:00.347
We call, they deliver the food.

30:00.367 --> 30:02.949
Oh, your wife no cook for you?

30:02.969 --> 30:04.871
Not very often.

30:07.407 --> 30:10.990
Well... well, she does, um,

30:11.010 --> 30:15.462
make this, like, pasta bake,
occasionally.

30:15.482 --> 30:18.965
It's really good, but...

30:18.985 --> 30:20.853
it's nothing like this.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.674
Mm-hmm.

30:27.694 --> 30:30.142
I will teach you something
to show your wife

30:30.162 --> 30:31.944
to cook for you and your family.

30:31.964 --> 30:34.246
Okay.

30:34.266 --> 30:35.482
- Counterclockwise?
- Mm-hmm.

30:35.502 --> 30:36.683
I'm gonna go clockwise, too.

30:36.703 --> 30:37.684
- Check it out.

30:37.704 --> 30:39.572
Going counterclockwise.

31:10.336 --> 31:11.704
Hi.

31:33.460 --> 31:34.707
- Hmm?

31:34.727 --> 31:37.163
Oh, sit here? Okay.

31:49.476 --> 31:51.744
- Oh. My nails.
- Sí.

31:56.348 --> 31:58.551
Great.

32:09.395 --> 32:12.512
Oh, no, uh, two...
That's...

32:12.532 --> 32:13.513
Yeah?

32:13.533 --> 32:16.603
Perfecto. Yeah.

32:19.338 --> 32:21.508
Beautiful.

32:56.943 --> 32:58.758
Chido.

32:58.778 --> 33:01.548
Oh, uh... no, I'm good.

33:03.550 --> 33:05.451
All right.

33:21.601 --> 33:23.102
Chido!

33:24.436 --> 33:25.785
- Chido.
- Chido.

33:25.805 --> 33:27.754
So fucking chido right now.

33:27.774 --> 33:29.756
Fucking chido.

33:29.776 --> 33:32.258
You show your wife this,

33:32.278 --> 33:34.861
she can cook this dinner
for you and all your babies.

33:34.881 --> 33:36.462
Yeah.

33:36.482 --> 33:39.165
We don't have babies, though.

33:39.185 --> 33:41.400
Children all grown?

33:41.420 --> 33:43.055
Oh, we don't have kids.

33:44.356 --> 33:46.172
Oh.

33:46.192 --> 33:48.407
I'm sorry.

33:48.427 --> 33:50.843
Oh, no, no, don't be.

33:50.863 --> 33:53.045
No, we just never got around to it.

33:53.065 --> 33:57.216
No, we both work and did other things

33:57.236 --> 33:59.385
and then ten years goes by
and you're...

33:59.405 --> 34:01.153
No cooking, no babies?

34:01.173 --> 34:04.591
She don't sound like one good wife.

34:04.611 --> 34:06.158
- Cut this?
- Mm-hmm.

34:06.178 --> 34:08.594
No, no, no, no, no.
No, she's great.

34:08.614 --> 34:10.429
- Yeah.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.599
She's, um...

34:12.619 --> 34:15.668
she's kind of funny, you know.

34:15.688 --> 34:18.605
Like if you don't want
to do something,

34:18.625 --> 34:21.407
she'll persuade you to do it.

34:21.427 --> 34:23.842
And then after you do it,

34:23.862 --> 34:26.713
you're grateful
that you did, you know.

34:26.733 --> 34:29.315
She's, like...

34:29.335 --> 34:31.984
enthusiastic about stuff.

34:32.004 --> 34:35.321
People love her for it, you know.

34:35.341 --> 34:37.623
Does she work a job?

34:37.643 --> 34:40.159
Yeah, she's always worked.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.829
In school, she lied about her age

34:42.849 --> 34:45.931
so that she could work
at Mr. Donut.

34:45.952 --> 34:47.266
So she a liar, too, then?

34:47.286 --> 34:48.668
No, no, no, no.

34:48.688 --> 34:51.670
- No, Helena's terrific.
- Mm.

34:51.690 --> 34:53.205
You work?

34:53.225 --> 34:55.261
Uh, wealth management.

34:57.563 --> 35:00.446
I... I manage people's money.

35:00.466 --> 35:03.082
Hmm.

35:03.102 --> 35:05.351
Um... I take people's money,

35:05.371 --> 35:08.655
and then I try to make them
more money.

35:08.675 --> 35:11.658
And then in exchange,

35:11.678 --> 35:14.894
my firm gets to keep
some of that money,

35:14.914 --> 35:18.665
and then I get to keep
some of that money.

35:18.685 --> 35:21.668
You like this job?

35:21.688 --> 35:24.691
Yeah. It's okay.

35:26.492 --> 35:27.940
I need the money.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.108
Mm.

35:29.128 --> 35:31.010
To pay for all the food
to be delivered.

35:31.030 --> 35:35.447
Yeah. And other things.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.684
Which one you prefer?

35:37.704 --> 35:40.152
- What?
- To sleep on.

35:40.172 --> 35:43.422
I thought... I thought your
brother-in-law was coming.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.257
Tomorrow maybe.

35:45.277 --> 35:49.415
Oh, no, no, no. I... I have
to go to Guatemala now.

35:50.717 --> 35:51.964
The only way to go now

35:51.984 --> 35:54.066
is across the river
with the smugglers.

35:54.086 --> 35:56.168
- I can't spend the night.
- Sure, you can.

35:56.188 --> 35:57.704
You take my bed,

35:57.724 --> 35:59.571
we'll put a blanket
on the porch for me.

35:59.591 --> 36:01.207
No, no, no, I-I can't.

36:01.227 --> 36:03.429
You insult me, if you refuse.

36:07.399 --> 36:09.415
Can I check out the porch?

36:09.435 --> 36:12.404
'Cause that's...
that's more my speed.

36:15.541 --> 36:17.176
All right?

37:00.219 --> 37:02.288
* *

37:29.949 --> 37:32.498
It's good to see you, man.

37:32.518 --> 37:35.354
Yeah. Yeah.

37:36.688 --> 37:37.970
Where them other two clowns?

37:37.990 --> 37:40.506
They fucking left us.

37:40.526 --> 37:42.508
- You sure?
- Oh, yeah.

37:42.528 --> 37:44.310
I checked... they're gone.

37:44.330 --> 37:47.113
I went around every single bar
I could find, which was one,

37:47.133 --> 37:49.836
and nothing, nobody's seen them.

37:51.703 --> 37:54.020
They have passports...
we don't.

37:54.040 --> 37:55.875
They took half the money.

38:01.580 --> 38:03.149
Okay.

38:15.161 --> 38:17.864
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

38:22.869 --> 38:27.306
You need to know I still
got your back, you hear me?

38:29.141 --> 38:31.123
All right, Leslie.

38:31.143 --> 38:33.993
Leslie?!

38:34.013 --> 38:36.182
You got pretty close.

38:55.534 --> 38:58.004
That was a, that was...
that was a lucky one.

39:03.910 --> 39:06.345
* *

39:27.566 --> 39:29.481
[Isabel groaning}

39:29.501 --> 39:31.938
* *

39:34.140 --> 39:36.522
- Yes!

39:36.542 --> 39:38.958
U-S-A!

39:38.978 --> 39:40.579
U-S-A!

39:42.781 --> 39:43.849
Muy fácil.

39:55.962 --> 39:57.964
Hey, muchachos!

40:03.769 --> 40:05.071
Uno, dos, tres.

40:14.513 --> 40:16.828
Vamos.

40:16.848 --> 40:20.967
Oh, uh, uh, dónde... wh-where
you... where you going?

40:20.987 --> 40:22.234
Belize City.

40:22.254 --> 40:23.769
- Oh.
- Chido.

40:23.789 --> 40:25.191
I-I can't.

40:29.928 --> 40:31.310
Yeah, I can't.

40:31.330 --> 40:32.898
Thank...
It was great to meet you.

40:37.169 --> 40:39.138
Stay golden, pony-boy.

40:43.375 --> 40:46.692
- Ciao, Joel.
- Adios.

40:46.712 --> 40:48.214
Gracias for everything.

41:07.633 --> 41:10.069
* *

41:38.730 --> 41:40.266
Hello?

42:41.127 --> 42:43.562
* *

43:10.956 --> 43:14.326
* *

43:57.436 --> 43:59.551
The rest of the money?

43:59.571 --> 44:03.088
I'm not sure where it is.

44:03.108 --> 44:05.191
There was a package I gave Milo

44:05.211 --> 44:07.626
and a bag with the rest of the
money that didn't belong to you.

44:07.646 --> 44:08.960
I'd like to know where they are.

44:08.980 --> 44:10.882
The package is in the ocean.

44:14.085 --> 44:15.621
It's in the ocean.

44:29.335 --> 44:30.916
Them be lost.

44:30.936 --> 44:33.452
All right, we are definitely
the gringos around here,

44:33.472 --> 44:37.223
so let's, uh, let's just find
somewhere quiet

44:37.243 --> 44:41.413
to chill until we figure out
what the hell we're doing.

45:12.478 --> 45:14.092
Hey!

45:14.112 --> 45:16.428
He took the bag! Hey!

45:16.448 --> 45:18.697
- Hey, man!
- Excuse me.

45:18.717 --> 45:20.966

Pharmacy.

46:15.407 --> 46:17.188
Hey, Erica.

46:17.208 --> 46:18.457
It's Gus.

46:18.477 --> 46:20.992
- You back in Chicago?
- No.

46:21.012 --> 46:22.227
Are you still in Belize?

46:22.247 --> 46:24.330
I-I believe so. Um...

46:24.350 --> 46:25.897
How are you? Are you okay?

46:25.917 --> 46:27.699
It's not safe for you here.

46:27.719 --> 46:29.968
- Go home.
- I know it's not safe, but, um...

46:29.988 --> 46:33.472
look, I don't have a passport,
and, uh,

46:33.492 --> 46:34.873
my friend, Lex, he's with me,

46:34.893 --> 46:38.109
and neither one of us
have passports and...

46:38.129 --> 46:39.678
we're lost.

46:39.698 --> 46:42.080
Well, you're smart.
You'll find a way.

46:42.100 --> 46:43.382
No, we're really lost.

46:43.402 --> 46:45.817
Like, I-I have no idea
what to do.

46:45.837 --> 46:48.554
Gus...

46:48.574 --> 46:51.256
All right, look around you...
what do you see?

46:51.276 --> 46:53.191
Uh, ocean...

46:53.211 --> 46:56.495
um, P.G. Lionfish Pub.

46:56.515 --> 46:59.918
That's Punta Gorda.
You're still in Belize.

47:03.655 --> 47:05.036
All right, give me the address,

47:05.056 --> 47:06.872
and I'll come get you.

47:06.892 --> 47:10.061
Yeah, yeah, you would do that for me?

47:12.030 --> 47:13.945
Of course.

47:13.965 --> 47:16.101
* *

47:36.187 --> 47:39.705
If anonymity is a priority,
we have a minor issue.

47:39.725 --> 47:42.107
Our system is governed by SWIFT.

47:42.127 --> 47:43.509
Yeah, I know all about SWIFT.

47:43.529 --> 47:44.810
You are an accountant?

47:44.830 --> 47:47.045
A financial consultant,
wealth management.

47:47.065 --> 47:49.448
Wait, now this is a payment order

47:49.468 --> 47:51.417
from my corporation to my account,

47:51.437 --> 47:52.618
so why would there be an issue?

47:52.638 --> 47:54.520
Well, you made
a similar payment order

47:54.540 --> 48:00.178
three days ago in Belize
for Angel Gibson.

48:02.113 --> 48:04.062
Angel.

48:04.082 --> 48:06.598
So our only option here

48:06.618 --> 48:08.534
is to put a hold on my deposit?

48:08.554 --> 48:10.769
- How long?
- Not long.

48:10.789 --> 48:13.872
I will call you personally
when the time comes.

48:13.892 --> 48:15.441
Okay.

48:15.461 --> 48:18.844
Um... you can reach,
let's see...

48:18.864 --> 48:22.147
All right, you can reach me
at this number.

48:22.167 --> 48:23.482
Okay?

48:23.502 --> 48:25.216
Oh, listen, uh,

48:25.236 --> 48:27.539
what's the best hotel in town?

48:47.993 --> 48:49.875
Hello?

48:49.895 --> 48:51.477
Hello?

48:51.497 --> 48:55.013
Hi, Helena.

48:55.033 --> 48:57.616
Where are you?

48:57.636 --> 49:01.119
Still here.

49:01.139 --> 49:04.322
I, um...

49:04.342 --> 49:06.578
Helena, it's...

49:10.516 --> 49:11.763
Cobi?

49:11.783 --> 49:13.131
It's been a real nightmare,

49:13.151 --> 49:16.367
but, uh, I'm fine, you know, so...

49:16.387 --> 49:18.857
Okay.

49:21.527 --> 49:22.741
"Okay"?

49:22.761 --> 49:24.275
When are you coming back?

49:24.295 --> 49:26.377
I was supposed to be back
a day and a half ago.

49:26.397 --> 49:27.879
Yeah, you called a few days ago

49:27.899 --> 49:29.881
to wire money
for a business opportunity.

49:29.901 --> 49:32.651
I assumed you were staying
longer, and you did.

49:32.671 --> 49:34.620
Joel says hi.

49:34.640 --> 49:37.355
How-how is he?

49:37.375 --> 49:39.758
Have you spoken to him?

49:39.778 --> 49:40.892
Not recently.

49:40.912 --> 49:42.728
Really? When?

49:42.748 --> 49:44.329
- I don't know when.
- You don't remember...

49:44.349 --> 49:45.864
...You don't remember

49:45.884 --> 49:47.432
the, uh, the last time
you spoke to him?

49:47.452 --> 49:49.267
No. Why?

49:49.287 --> 49:53.038
Oh, 'cause he said that
you guys had... like, lunch.

49:53.058 --> 49:55.173
...Actually, lunches.

49:55.193 --> 49:56.708
...When he came into town,

49:56.728 --> 49:59.665
he called me for lunch.
So what?

50:04.402 --> 50:06.552
- You fucking him?
- No.

50:06.572 --> 50:08.587
Oh, you haven't fucked him yet,

50:08.607 --> 50:10.622
but you want to, is that it?

50:10.642 --> 50:12.624
Is Joel there?
Put him on the phone.

50:12.644 --> 50:14.225
Nah, he told me everything.

50:14.245 --> 50:16.227
Well, if he told you we slept
together, he's lying.

50:16.247 --> 50:18.163
Are you unhappy, is that it?

50:18.183 --> 50:22.200
You know what, I'll talk
to you when you get home.

50:22.220 --> 50:23.669
- Okay. Bye.
- Wait.

50:23.689 --> 50:25.423
- Like what...

50:30.495 --> 50:32.631
Fuck.

50:48.714 --> 50:50.729
Cobi, it-it's Joel.

50:50.749 --> 50:52.931
I'm in Belize City,
at least I think I am.

50:52.951 --> 50:57.803
I've been, uh,
uh, taken, um, captured.

50:57.823 --> 51:00.138
Kidnapped,
wh-whatever you call it.

51:00.158 --> 51:01.807
I'm serious.

51:01.827 --> 51:04.309
Uh, this guy wants the money,
all of it.

51:04.329 --> 51:08.479
He already has what I took,
and he wants the rest, so...

51:08.499 --> 51:10.348
Uh...

51:10.368 --> 51:12.784
call me-call me back
at this number and...

51:12.804 --> 51:14.205
there will be further...

51:16.507 --> 51:18.356
- It's, uh...
- * If you have a friend on whom *

51:18.376 --> 51:19.625
* You think you can rely *

51:19.645 --> 51:21.880
* You are a lucky man *

51:24.082 --> 51:27.365
* If you've found the reason
to live on and not to die *

51:27.385 --> 51:29.688
* You are a lucky man *

51:31.456 --> 51:35.106
* Preachers and poets
and scholars don't know it *

51:35.126 --> 51:38.644
* Temples and statues
and steeples won't show it *

51:38.664 --> 51:42.447
* If you've got the secret,
just try not to blow it *

51:42.467 --> 51:44.135
* Stay a lucky man *

51:45.904 --> 51:47.806
* A lucky man *

51:49.340 --> 51:51.189
* If you've found the meaning *

51:51.209 --> 51:52.924
* Of the truth in this old world *

51:52.944 --> 51:54.813
* You are a lucky man *

51:56.682 --> 51:58.196
* If knowledge
hangs around your neck *

51:58.216 --> 51:59.798
* Like pearls instead of chains *

51:59.818 --> 52:01.853
* You are a lucky man *

52:03.855 --> 52:07.238
* Takers and fakers and talkers
won't tell you *

52:07.258 --> 52:10.676
* Teachers and preachers
will just buy and sell you *

52:10.696 --> 52:13.945
* When no one can tempt you
with heaven or hell *

52:13.965 --> 52:16.835
* You'll be a lucky man *

52:26.745 --> 52:29.214
* *

52:39.190 --> 52:41.426
* *

52:54.505 --> 52:57.823
* Takers and fakers and talkers
won't tell you *

52:57.843 --> 53:01.492
* Teachers and preachers
will just buy and sell you *

53:01.512 --> 53:04.730
* When no one can tempt you
with heaven or hell *

53:04.750 --> 53:08.299
* You'll be a lucky man *

53:08.319 --> 53:12.137
* You'll be better by far
to be just what you are *

53:12.157 --> 53:15.573
* You can be what you want
if you are what you are *

53:15.593 --> 53:18.543
* And that's a lucky man *

53:18.563 --> 53:22.447
* Oh, yeah, a lucky man *

53:22.467 --> 53:26.451
* And that's a lucky,
a lucky, a lucky man *

53:26.471 --> 53:30.155
* A lucky, a lucky, a lucky man *

53:30.175 --> 53:34.345
* A lucky, a lucky,
a lucky man. *
