00:09.760 --> 00:13.594
In order to thwart the designs
of the Madoshi Babidi,

00:13.806 --> 00:17.424
who is attempting to revive
the sealed-up Majin Boo,

00:17.643 --> 00:21.636
Goku and company, who have gotten
aboard his ship, where he waits,

00:21.855 --> 00:24.562
had arrived at Stage Three.

00:34.743 --> 00:37.530
Dabra, the King of the
Demon Realm of Darkness,

00:37.746 --> 00:40.203
who had powered up in order
to defeat Goku and the others,

00:40.416 --> 00:42.452
is at last ready to strike.

00:43.752 --> 00:46.038
Meanwhile, at the Tenkaichi Budokai,

00:46.255 --> 00:52.216
a fierce battle between No. 18
and Mighty Mask had been unfolding.

00:52.428 --> 00:55.261
However, it was revealed that Mighty Mask

00:55.472 --> 01:00.182
was actually Trunks and Goten,
and they were disqualified.

01:00.394 --> 01:05.934
The only ones remaining at the end
were No. 18 and Mister Satan.

02:48.293 --> 02:53.003
"Enter the Headliner!
The Looming Demon King!!"

03:02.975 --> 03:05.011
This is taking too long!

03:06.019 --> 03:08.305
I wonder what sort of fellow will come out.

03:10.482 --> 03:13.974
I hope they hurry up.
What could they be doing?

03:14.194 --> 03:17.311
I can't wait to see how strong you've gotten.

03:17.531 --> 03:21.194
Gohan, have you made sure to
keep training with me not around?

03:21.410 --> 03:24.493
Oh, uh, well, you see...

03:24.705 --> 03:27.447
Hmph. Unfortunately, he's been
taking advantage of peaceful times,

03:27.666 --> 03:30.157
and apparently hasn't
done very much training.

03:30.377 --> 03:33.084
Right now, our power is greater than his.

03:33.297 --> 03:36.164
But then, if he blows his stack and snaps again,

03:36.383 --> 03:38.715
there's still no telling what might happen.

03:43.390 --> 03:48.475
S-So that's why these three
are so relaxed. If it comes to it,

03:48.687 --> 03:51.224
they can unleash an
incredible amount of power,

03:51.440 --> 03:53.806
like Son Goku-san momentarily
demonstrated earlier.

03:54.026 --> 03:57.018
l-lt absolutely defies belief.

03:57.237 --> 04:00.479
T-To think that l, the Kaioshin,
would be so shaken up

04:00.699 --> 04:02.360
by people from the lower realm...

04:07.789 --> 04:09.529
|-|t can't be!

04:13.837 --> 04:15.668
D-Dabra!

04:20.135 --> 04:25.004
l-lmagine, Dabra appearing this soon!

04:25.223 --> 04:28.215
It is quite a feat for people such
as yourselves to defeat Yakon

04:28.435 --> 04:30.847
and make it all the way to Stage Three.

04:31.063 --> 04:34.476
One might even call it miraculous.
You have my admiration.

04:34.691 --> 04:40.937
However, this is as far as you go.
You will have to face me now.

04:42.366 --> 04:46.826
Hmph, if you, his number-one guy,
are showing up already,

04:47.037 --> 04:50.621
Babidi must be pretty panicked, huh?

04:50.832 --> 04:57.249
That's enough idle chit-chat.
Come at me now--a|l of you at once!

04:57.464 --> 04:59.170
No way, no way!

04:59.383 --> 05:01.715
It's my turn to be the one who defeats you!

05:01.927 --> 05:02.882
What did you say?!

05:03.095 --> 05:05.928
And more importantly,
let's not fight in this cramped space!

05:06.139 --> 05:09.597
Let's take the fight
somewhere else, like Father did!

05:09.810 --> 05:12.552
Oh, but that dark place could be a problem...

05:13.563 --> 05:16.691
W-Why, you...!

05:16.900 --> 05:19.232
That is enough of your mockery!

05:19.444 --> 05:22.561
Just a minute, Dabra!

05:22.781 --> 05:25.397
If we're to completely restore Majin Boo,

05:25.617 --> 05:28.359
it won't do to have you
delivering shocks to the spaceship.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.820
If possible, would you fight
somewhere else for me?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.826
Yes, sir, as you wish.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.373
Where would you like?

05:35.585 --> 05:37.962
The least I can do is offer them a handicap.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.958
A world with an environment
similar to that of Earth.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.633
You're confident, huh? And I can't blame you.

05:44.845 --> 05:48.008
There's no way that anyone
can stand up to you.

05:48.223 --> 05:49.258
Okay, here goes!

05:49.474 --> 05:52.511
Papparapa!!

05:57.983 --> 05:59.689
W-What's this?!

06:09.453 --> 06:12.365
Well? You should have no
problem with this place.

06:12.581 --> 06:14.663
All right! Well, here goes!

06:14.875 --> 06:16.740
Keep your eyes open, Gohan!

06:49.409 --> 06:52.822
P-Please! D-Don't kill me! I'll do anything!

06:53.038 --> 06:58.032
Shut up, and stop screaming.
Keep quiet, or I really will kill you.

06:58.251 --> 07:01.835
Uh-oh! Contestant No. 18
has him in a headlock!

07:02.047 --> 07:04.834
Listen up. Keep your voice down.
Do you want to win?

07:05.050 --> 07:09.669
N-No, l-l've had enough!
J-Just don't do anything brutal to me!

07:09.888 --> 07:13.506
If you like, I'm willing to let you win.

07:14.518 --> 07:17.806
Y-You're tickling me...
W-What did you just say?!

07:18.021 --> 07:21.479
I said I was going to let you win.

07:21.691 --> 07:24.478
In return, you're going
to give me 20 million Zeni.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.481
l'll lose to you. Not a bad deal, is it?

07:27.697 --> 07:30.825
That's all it will take for you
to defend your honor.

07:31.034 --> 07:34.526
What could this be?
Mister Satan hasn't moved a muscle!

07:34.746 --> 07:38.159
Has even the great Mister Satan
messed with the wrong person?

07:38.375 --> 07:40.991
What's the matter, Satan?! Let her have it!

07:41.211 --> 07:43.748
T-Twenty million Zeni, you say?

07:43.964 --> 07:46.376
The grand prize is 10 million Zeni.

07:46.591 --> 07:49.173
You just have to put up
the remaining 10 million.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.501
It's a small price to pay, isn't it?

07:50.720 --> 07:52.927
B-But...

07:53.140 --> 07:57.224
Hey, it's okay with me.
I could just knock you out,

07:57.435 --> 07:59.721
and make do with only 10 million Zeni.

07:59.938 --> 08:02.099
Knock me out?!

08:06.736 --> 08:08.772
--Satan, you dumb jerk!
--Where's your dignity?!

08:08.989 --> 08:13.733
--Don't ever come back here again!
--Get out of here, right now!

08:16.496 --> 08:19.078
Hmph! I hate you, Papa!

08:33.929 --> 08:35.181
What'll it be?!

08:35.390 --> 08:38.974
l-l'll pay! M will be glad to pay you, of course!

08:39.186 --> 08:42.519
Okay, it's settled.
Nice doing business with you.

08:45.358 --> 08:50.569
Oh! Mister Satan has
thrown off Contestant No. 18!

08:50.780 --> 08:53.112
Oh, that's Mister Satan for you!

08:53.325 --> 08:55.031
D-Damn!

08:56.036 --> 08:57.822
Hurry up and come at me.

09:09.549 --> 09:13.337
I've got a handle on all of your
moves now! Too bad for you!

09:13.553 --> 09:16.511
Frankly, you are no match for me!

09:16.723 --> 09:17.758
For real?!

09:17.974 --> 09:19.510
That's awesome, Mister Satan!

09:19.726 --> 09:22.763
I will admit that you have considerable skill.

09:22.979 --> 09:25.095
However, you've picked on the wrong guy!

09:25.315 --> 09:29.058
You've given a good effort,
but I am, after all, the champion!

09:29.277 --> 09:31.063
Okay, get to it already, you idiot!

09:31.279 --> 09:33.235
A-Ah, right...

09:38.536 --> 09:41.403
Oh, my! Now Mister Satan is striking back!

09:41.623 --> 09:43.284
This is amazing! It's a flurry of punches!

09:43.500 --> 09:45.912
Contestant No. 18 is being
pummeled black and blue!

09:50.674 --> 09:53.381
This isn't what we agreed to, is it...?

09:53.593 --> 09:57.177
| just said I would let you win;
I didn't say I wouldn't fight back.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.505
It would look suspicious if
this was one-sided, right?

09:59.724 --> 10:01.976
B-But my body can't take this...!

10:02.185 --> 10:05.894
All right. In that case,
pick me up and throw me.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.518
Then finish me off with
one of your signature moves.

10:08.733 --> 10:10.815
--Got it?
--Y-Yes!

10:11.945 --> 10:16.109
Oh! Mister Satan has
thrown Contestant No. 18!

10:18.827 --> 10:21.193
Here goes! I'm about to finish you!

10:21.413 --> 10:23.495
Way to go, Mister Satan!

10:26.167 --> 10:31.036
Take this! Satan Miracle Special
Ultra Super Megaton Punch!!

10:32.757 --> 10:34.964
H-He got her with all of that one!

10:47.355 --> 10:49.846
U-Uh...

10:50.066 --> 10:52.648
This is your finishing move?

10:52.861 --> 10:55.318
Y-Yes, ostensibly...

11:17.427 --> 11:22.763
D-Did you see that?! Er, it may
have looked like a casual punch,

11:22.974 --> 11:26.466
but it inflicts an explosive shock
after a few seconds!

11:26.686 --> 11:29.894
That's the Satan Miracle... uh...

11:30.106 --> 11:33.974
...Beautiful Super Bari-Bari Punch!

11:37.864 --> 11:39.650
Way to go, Satan!

11:41.242 --> 11:44.905
Mister Satan is the victor!

11:53.046 --> 11:55.412
Number One!!

11:55.632 --> 11:57.497
You really are incredible, Satan!

11:57.717 --> 11:59.173
Leave it to the savior of the Earth!

11:59.386 --> 12:02.878
Contestant No. 18 demonstrated
her astounding strength,

12:03.098 --> 12:06.010
but she was beaten all-too-easily
when faced with Mister Satan!

12:06.226 --> 12:10.185
Mister Satan defends his championship title!

12:10.397 --> 12:12.262
What in tarnation happened?

12:12.482 --> 12:14.018
S-Search me.

12:18.446 --> 12:21.734
I'll come to your house
tomorrow for the money.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.157
If you don't pay up, I'll kill you.

12:24.369 --> 12:28.237
R-Right. Understood.

12:43.096 --> 12:46.805
So there you have it.
That's why everyone went there.

12:50.895 --> 12:52.851
Madoshis...?

12:53.064 --> 12:55.441
M-M-Majins...?

12:55.650 --> 12:56.890
Y-Yeah .

12:57.110 --> 12:59.271
D-Did you hear that, Goten?

12:59.487 --> 13:01.193
U-Uh-huh!

13:08.413 --> 13:10.369
--Sounds interesting!
--Sounds interesting!

13:10.582 --> 13:11.947
--Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
--Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

13:12.167 --> 13:13.156
H-Huh?!

13:13.376 --> 13:14.161
That way, right?

13:14.377 --> 13:16.709
Yeah, yeah! I can sense
Papa and the others' Ki there!

13:16.921 --> 13:20.288
H-Hold on, you guys!
Don't tell me you're going there?!

13:20.508 --> 13:21.964
Hurry! We have to move fast,

13:22.177 --> 13:24.008
or Papa and the others
will wipe out the enemy!

13:24.220 --> 13:28.805
No! No! No! I wanna see! I wanna see!
I wanna see this Majin Boo!

13:29.017 --> 13:30.507
Go!!

13:33.146 --> 13:36.183
--Yahoo!
--Yahoo!

13:40.445 --> 13:41.935
No way.

13:49.829 --> 13:50.693
Hey, tell me...

13:50.914 --> 13:52.700
What is it, Goten?

13:52.916 --> 13:54.656
What's a Majin?

13:59.923 --> 14:02.039
Now, look...

14:02.258 --> 14:05.716
You were excited to go see him,
without even knowing that?

14:05.929 --> 14:09.763
Uh-huh. So, Trunks-kun, you know what it is?

14:09.974 --> 14:14.434
Eh? W-Well, o-of course I do.
A Majin, you see, is...

14:14.646 --> 14:15.556
Uh-huh...

14:15.772 --> 14:18.138
A Majin, you see, is...

14:18.358 --> 14:19.723
Uh-huh, uh-huh...

14:19.943 --> 14:23.356
Well... that is...

14:23.571 --> 14:25.107
What is a Majin?

14:29.494 --> 14:33.863
Th-The thing is... A-Anyhow...

14:35.625 --> 14:37.661
He's this insanely awesome guy!

14:37.877 --> 14:40.209
Goten, when you see him,
I'm sure you'll be surprised!

14:40.421 --> 14:42.412
Wow! I can't wait!

14:42.632 --> 14:43.542
More than likely...

14:43.758 --> 14:47.671
--Huh?
--Uh, l-let's hurry, Goten!

14:47.887 --> 14:49.388
Uh-huh!

15:37.312 --> 15:38.802
You fool!

16:22.982 --> 16:24.483
What?!

16:36.079 --> 16:39.412
Okay, Gohan, show us your power!

17:03.898 --> 17:05.398
What?!

17:25.586 --> 17:27.087
Dabra!

17:52.280 --> 17:53.941
l-lncredible!

18:04.333 --> 18:07.917
Give me your best! You're not
even putting up a fight like this!

18:15.511 --> 18:17.092
Very well.

19:18.449 --> 19:19.985
I'm actually over here!

19:20.201 --> 19:21.361
Die!

19:21.577 --> 19:23.078
Oh, no!

19:35.424 --> 19:37.551
That's one down.

19:46.853 --> 19:49.720
Ow-w-w-w... I got sloppy...

19:53.526 --> 19:55.608
He's lying in wait for me.

20:29.645 --> 20:31.181
There you are!

20:33.983 --> 20:35.473
Gohan!

20:52.960 --> 20:56.123
Even powered up,
that's still the best you've got?

20:58.966 --> 21:00.797
That's the King of the Demon
Realm of Darkness for you.

21:01.010 --> 21:04.502
Sure enough, he's in a different
league than Puipui and Yakon.

21:08.309 --> 21:13.679
Damn! I may have let my guard down,
but that won't happen again!

21:13.898 --> 21:15.763
We're just getting started!

21:18.903 --> 21:23.897
Dabra is an even match
for the full-powered Gohan.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.947
Indeed, he has proven true to his title

21:26.160 --> 21:28.196
of King of the Demon Realm of Darkness.

21:28.412 --> 21:34.749
How will their battle turn out?
Are you all right, Gohan?

22:41.819 --> 22:43.525
Heya! l'm Goku!

22:43.738 --> 22:46.024
Hmm? Dabra is withdrawing?

22:46.240 --> 22:49.698
It doesn't look like he's running away.
Just what is going on here?

22:49.910 --> 22:52.447
Babidi-sama, there is one among them

22:52.663 --> 22:56.497
with a strong enough evil in
their heart to turn to our side.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.495
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:58.711 --> 23:01.703
"A Heart of Evil Awakened--
Vegeta, Prince of Destruction!"

23:01.922 --> 23:05.665
No, Vegeta-san! Don't let that guy control you!
