I have to know.

00:24.483 --> 00:25.848
One day, you will know.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.887
No, it's Nathan Stark.

00:56.932 --> 00:59.799
He's trying to dodge
jury duty by claiming
scientific immunity.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.474
That sounds like Nathan.

01:01.562 --> 01:05.305
He's down in Section Five
with Kim overseeing
some big test.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.063
What kind of test?

01:07.109 --> 01:08.315
Do you care?

01:08.735 --> 01:10.271
Not really, just talking.

was detected.

just appeared.

breeched the artifact

14:38.669 --> 14:40.330
Well, that's
simply impossible.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.377
We ran every test, right?

14:42.465 --> 14:44.547
There was no sign
of containment breech.

14:45.968 --> 14:50.052
But there was a radiation
surge just before we found
the body.

14:50.556 --> 14:53.514
There's only one place
these could have come from,

14:53.726 --> 14:54.715
the artifact.

14:58.689 --> 14:59.815
Right.

15:05.405 --> 15:07.396
CARTER: There has to be
some way to identify the body.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.904
In this case,
the body's far too distorted.

15:15.623 --> 15:16.908
That could work.
I doubt it.

15:16.958 --> 15:20.667
Yeah. But it's designed
to reconstruct entire
contiguous DNA strands

15:20.753 --> 15:21.993

15:22.088 --> 15:23.953

experimental stages.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.004
Yeah, but if she can
put the pieces together,

15:26.092 --> 15:28.674
then we can
rebuild our John Doe
on a cellular level.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.939
Are you sure?
Yeah, positive.

of all the people
who had access

something like this.

is Nathan Stark.

to show you.

I mean, maybe the sample
was contaminated?

23:09.513 --> 23:11.424
I've checked.
It's no mistake.

23:12.558 --> 23:14.139

at is definitely...

23:14.268 --> 23:15.257
You.

23:20.566 --> 23:22.773

didn't you, Henry?

23:23.736 --> 23:24.896
Henry?

23:26.030 --> 23:27.895
He was the other name
on the list.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.533
Henry, what did you do?

23:38.042 --> 23:40.078
So the body we found
fused to the wall,

23:40.169 --> 23:42.501
that body right there,
that's you?

23:42.588 --> 23:43.577
That's me.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.963

four years ago.

23:47.551 --> 23:48.586

23:48.636 --> 23:51.048
But you're here right now.
It doesn't make any sense.

23:51.096 --> 23:55.135
It does if Henry changed
the outcome of the accident
using Walter's machine.

23:56.936 --> 23:58.142
Henry?

23:58.228 --> 24:00.435
I lost her the first time
to Jason.

24:01.732 --> 24:03.939
But we got a second chance.

24:08.614 --> 24:10.070
I couldn't let you go.

24:11.951 --> 24:12.940
They...

24:14.912 --> 24:16.277
They couldn't
identify your body,

24:16.330 --> 24:19.618
so they brought me in
to see if I could...

24:23.170 --> 24:26.128
It took days.

24:28.467 --> 24:32.801
So you used Walter's
tachyonic accelerator
to change history?

24:33.305 --> 24:35.842
That's insane.
You lobbied for Stark's job
to gain access...

24:35.933 --> 24:37.173
It was the only way.

24:37.267 --> 24:39.599
Nathan was never going
to let me try this.
He knew the risks.

24:39.645 --> 24:40.851
Well, what risks?

24:42.815 --> 24:44.271

24:45.651 --> 24:48.267

with a different outcome.

competing for the same
space-time continuum.

One where you died.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.368

we're living in
the wrong time line.

really willing to take?

27:46.165 --> 27:48.497
Allison, what a surprise.

27:50.711 --> 27:51.996
Are you okay?

27:52.462 --> 27:53.838
I really don't
want him here.

27:53.922 --> 27:56.174
Neither do I,
but I also don't want
the universe to unravel.

27:56.258 --> 27:57.293
No,

27:58.594 --> 27:59.583
I mean it.

28:00.304 --> 28:02.169
I don't want him
to try to fix it.

28:03.640 --> 28:07.724
I know it's selfish,
but I love our life.

28:08.687 --> 28:10.052
I love this baby.

28:10.689 --> 28:11.804
I know.

28:12.733 --> 28:13.813
Me, too.

28:15.319 --> 28:18.982
Well, well, well,
if it isn't the Carters,

28:19.031 --> 28:20.817
and the little Carter-to-be.

28:20.866 --> 28:22.197
Pregnancy suits you.

28:23.327 --> 28:25.192
Yeah, it does.

28:25.662 --> 28:26.868
Hello, Sheriff.

28:27.456 --> 28:29.117
You ready to save the world?

28:33.795 --> 28:34.784
You ready?

28:37.507 --> 28:38.542
No.

28:53.565 --> 28:54.805
So, let me get this straight.

28:54.900 --> 28:57.437
I got fired for cutting
corners on the artifact,

28:57.527 --> 29:01.145
but Henry gets to play with
the space-time continuum?

29:01.240 --> 29:03.572
We didn't know what he was
doing until after he did it.

29:03.617 --> 29:05.903
You realize that was
a rhetorical question?

29:06.578 --> 29:07.909
I do now, yeah.

29:07.955 --> 29:09.570
So what are
we dealing with here?

29:09.665 --> 29:10.654
A mess.

29:11.750 --> 29:14.787
Time is supposed
to be fixed.

29:15.545 --> 29:16.751
A straight line.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.343
Start here, you end here,

29:24.429 --> 29:26.715
experiencing everything
in logical order.

29:26.765 --> 29:31.054
Henry went back
and changed history,

29:31.103 --> 29:33.594
thereby creating a paradox.

29:33.647 --> 29:36.684
A completely separate
and different timeline.

29:36.775 --> 29:38.766
We know that much.
What do we do about it?

29:38.860 --> 29:40.771
Not do. Undo.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.070
We need to stop Henry
from saving Kim,

29:44.116 --> 29:48.951
thereby erasing
this timeline completely.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.322
Okay, how do we do that?

29:50.414 --> 29:52.120
Someone's got to go back.

29:53.917 --> 29:54.906
Someone?

29:56.253 --> 29:57.242
Okay.

29:58.463 --> 29:59.623
Me.

30:01.758 --> 30:03.214
Glad we got that straight.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.172
Nathan,
thanks for doing this.

30:06.847 --> 30:08.758
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

30:19.484 --> 30:22.442
JO: You were right.
This is really nice.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.490
I'm glad
you changed your mind.

30:29.119 --> 30:32.077
I can't believe it took me
four years to get you naked.

30:33.332 --> 30:34.822
Outdoors, anyway.

30:36.001 --> 30:37.366
What convinced you?

30:40.505 --> 30:42.496
I just knew it was time.

31:12.788 --> 31:14.073
You found me.

31:15.207 --> 31:18.244
Well, it's
a big glass office.
It wasn't hard.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.132
You heard about
what happened downtown?

31:38.397 --> 31:40.228
I thought I could fix this.

31:42.067 --> 31:43.227
I can't.

31:44.528 --> 31:46.439
You had to know
this could happen.

31:49.116 --> 31:51.072
You weren't
going to tell me.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.360
I'd hoped I'd never have to.

31:57.582 --> 32:00.915
You know now
there's only one way
to make things right.

32:09.511 --> 32:12.218
I barely survived losing you
the first time.

32:15.600 --> 32:17.101
I can't... I can't...

32:18.228 --> 32:20.093
I can't do that again.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.766
This isn't just about you

32:25.861 --> 32:27.101
or me.

32:28.405 --> 32:29.611
I can't.

32:30.615 --> 32:31.900
You have to.

32:44.588 --> 32:45.623
Well?

32:45.672 --> 32:46.878
Working on it.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.334
Work faster.

32:49.301 --> 32:52.008
Would you like to try,
Shenﬁ?

32:54.431 --> 32:55.546
(SIGHS)

32:55.640 --> 32:57.801
All of the algorithms
are correct.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.053
I do not know
what is wrong.

32:59.144 --> 33:01.635
Maybe you're
missing something.
I'm not missing anything.

33:01.688 --> 33:04.600
Yes, you are. This.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.185
What's that?

33:06.276 --> 33:07.311
Nathan.

33:07.819 --> 33:11.903
The fragment I took
from the artifact
four years ago.

33:13.158 --> 33:14.443
You know something
I don't, Henry?

33:14.493 --> 33:15.824
It's trans-dimensional.

33:15.869 --> 33:18.485
It exists completely outside
our space-time continuum.

33:18.580 --> 33:20.946
So none of the rules apply.
Right.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.866
Okay, and now for those of us
who aren't astro-physicists.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.575
Ifthe Big Bang
was a plane crash,

33:25.670 --> 33:27.171
the artifact is
the black box.

33:27.255 --> 33:30.247
It's the last remnant of
whatever universe existed
before our own.

33:30.342 --> 33:34.301
Technology light years
beyond our own,
but billions of years old.

33:34.346 --> 33:37.383
At the moment,
physical time travel
is impossible,

33:37.474 --> 33:39.260
but the transfer
of consciousness from

33:39.351 --> 33:41.433
one temporal plane
to another

33:44.356 --> 33:45.436
isn't.

33:45.524 --> 33:47.435
So you sent your mind
back in time.

33:47.526 --> 33:48.641
More or less, yes.

33:48.693 --> 33:52.686
And now we have
to do it again?
No, you have to do it again.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.860
And, Nathan, I'm going to
leave this in your hands.

33:55.951 --> 33:58.442
Oh, can't say
I'm loving that plan.

33:58.537 --> 33:59.947
Where are you going, Henry?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.278
To say goodbye.

34:12.509 --> 34:14.374
Maybe Henry's right,

34:14.469 --> 34:16.585
and maybe things
will equalize

34:16.680 --> 34:18.841
and things can stay
the way they are.

34:18.890 --> 34:21.267
Henry knows things can't
stay the way they are.

34:24.688 --> 34:27.555
Aren't you even
a little afraid to lose me,

34:28.316 --> 34:29.852
to lose us?

34:31.152 --> 34:32.403
Listen to me.

34:33.238 --> 34:35.604
There's no time,
no space,

34:35.699 --> 34:38.566
no way that we don't
end up together.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.777
You just have to
have a little faith.

34:50.338 --> 34:52.124
Even knowing
what I know now,

34:53.425 --> 34:54.756
I would do it again.

34:56.428 --> 34:57.759
I know you would.

35:09.024 --> 35:10.935
We're running out of time,
Carter.

35:13.111 --> 35:14.726
(MACHINE HUMMING)

35:39.929 --> 35:42.181
SARAH:
Good morning, Sheriff Carter.

35:50.774 --> 35:52.139
Good morning, SARAH.

35:52.609 --> 35:54.770
I'm detecting an odd tone
in your voice.

35:54.819 --> 35:56.480
Is everything all right?

35:58.448 --> 35:59.608
What day is it?

36:00.158 --> 36:02.945
Tuesday, October 3rd, 2006.

36:15.674 --> 36:16.789
Zoe.

36:17.509 --> 36:18.624
Don't freak out. Okay?

36:18.677 --> 36:21.965
I swear, I was up
studying at Pilar's house
and I fell asleep and...

36:22.347 --> 36:24.884
Okay, now I'm kind
of freaking out.

36:24.974 --> 36:27.932
No, I'mjust glad
you're home safely.

36:29.854 --> 36:33.346
So you're not gonna
ground me until I'm 30?

36:34.234 --> 36:36.850
No, not today.

36:39.364 --> 36:40.479
Cool.

36:46.955 --> 36:47.944
Zoe?

36:51.793 --> 36:56.583
Look, I'm not sure how
this is going to play out,

36:56.673 --> 36:58.629
or even if I'm gonna
remember it,

36:58.717 --> 37:00.924
but I want you to know

37:01.511 --> 37:03.923
that I will always
be there for you.

37:06.891 --> 37:07.880
Okay.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.226
Is everything okay?

37:13.440 --> 37:14.805
It Will be.

37:19.571 --> 37:20.856
Good morning, Nathan.

37:20.905 --> 37:22.315
Good morning, Beverly.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.484
Do you have
something for me?

37:24.576 --> 37:25.656
I sure do.

37:40.049 --> 37:43.007
I finished
the psych evaluations
on the Global employees.

37:45.764 --> 37:48.801
Dr. Stark?
They're waiting for you
in Section Five.

37:50.477 --> 37:51.842
The big test?

37:55.607 --> 37:56.596
Excuse me.

37:59.944 --> 38:01.980
Allison.
Hey, Carter. What's up?

38:03.156 --> 38:04.521
Just looking for Henry.

38:04.616 --> 38:06.447
I haven't seen him.
You okay?

38:06.493 --> 38:07.653
Yeah, yeah.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.402
Hey!

38:11.956 --> 38:13.162
You look great.

38:13.625 --> 38:14.614
Thanks.

38:22.050 --> 38:24.917
All rover computer links
are up and running.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.378
Let's mark the time and date.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.469
9:27 am.
October 3rd, 2006.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.430
Let's take it
for a test drive.

38:53.540 --> 38:54.529
Jack!

38:55.333 --> 38:56.834
What are you doing here?

38:57.168 --> 38:58.624
I'm stopping you, Henry.

39:05.885 --> 39:08.422
We are at
marginal proximity now.

39:09.222 --> 39:10.428
Let's proceed.

39:11.349 --> 39:12.964
Igniting photon drill.

39:17.397 --> 39:18.853
CARTER: You can't do this.

39:20.024 --> 39:21.355
Get out of the way.
Henry!

39:21.776 --> 39:23.437
(GRUNTING)

39:25.071 --> 39:27.437
If you do this,
the world will unravel.

39:27.532 --> 39:29.773
I can't let her go!
I know!

39:30.827 --> 39:32.033
Moment of truth.

39:45.717 --> 39:46.706
(GRUNTING)

39:46.801 --> 39:48.302
That's why I'm here.

39:48.386 --> 39:51.048
Jack, I have to save her.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.595
You can't.

39:52.682 --> 39:53.797
It Changes everything.

39:53.892 --> 39:55.052
What's happening in there?

39:55.143 --> 39:57.054
I don't know.
Systems are offline.

39:57.103 --> 39:58.513
Get them back online!

39:58.563 --> 39:59.723
I'm trying!

40:03.067 --> 40:05.854
Jack, get the hell
out of the way!

40:05.904 --> 40:06.984
(GRUNTING)

40:07.071 --> 40:08.231
I can't let you do this.

40:08.323 --> 40:10.109
If you don't, Kim dies.

40:10.199 --> 40:11.860
If I do, we all die!

40:13.620 --> 40:14.735
Oh, my God.

No! No!

40:24.589 --> 40:26.250
(SOBBING)

40:27.050 --> 40:28.130
I'm sorry.

40:28.843 --> 40:31.004

What kind of accident?

40:54.953 --> 40:56.284
A breech of the artifact.

40:56.329 --> 40:59.241
A core sample was taken
and Kim Anderson was killed.

40:59.582 --> 41:00.822
Do you have the sample?

41:00.917 --> 41:03.659
Not yet,
but the biodegradable
micro-transmitter

41:03.753 --> 41:06.165
I planted on Stark
worked perfectly.

41:06.255 --> 41:08.211
Security scans never
detected a thing,

41:08.299 --> 41:10.381
and now we know
what we're dealing with.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.134
The Consortium
will be very pleased.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.545
Do you have a plan
for obtaining the sample?

41:15.640 --> 41:18.347
I always have a plan.
That’s why I’m here.

41:19.185 --> 41:21.801
You're here because
we want you here.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.679

41:44.836 --> 41:45.825
Yeah.

41:47.630 --> 41:49.461
I just hope that he can

41:53.302 --> 41:54.382
forgive me.

41:54.470 --> 41:55.846
Look, it was an accident,
Carter.

41:55.930 --> 41:57.966
There was nothing
you could have done.

41:59.225 --> 42:01.056
Yeah, I keep
telling myselfthat.

42:01.769 --> 42:04.727
Look, I know
it's hard to believe now,
but things will get better.

42:06.274 --> 42:08.230
You just have to have
a little faith.

42:10.987 --> 42:12.352
Allison,

42:14.407 --> 42:15.396
there's...

42:16.576 --> 42:17.691
What?

42:20.038 --> 42:21.027
Nothing.

42:21.122 --> 42:24.034
Come on.
I'll let you buy me
a cup of coffee.

42:25.460 --> 42:26.449
It's free.

42:27.045 --> 42:29.661
Oh, well, in that case,
I'll buy.

42:31.883 --> 42:36.377
You know,
I think this is definitely
becoming our thing.

42:37.305 --> 42:39.170
We don't have a thing.

42:45.897 --> 42:46.886
We might.
