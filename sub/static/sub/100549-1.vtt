00:32.500 --> 00:35.833
<i> Mr. Spenser, are you prepared</i>
<i>to tell the court, in your own words,</i>

00:35.916 --> 00:38.000
<i>what happened on the afternoon</i>
<i>of March 20th?</i>

00:38.083 --> 00:39.916
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

00:40.000 --> 00:41.625
<i>Please proceed.</i>

00:41.708 --> 00:45.416
<i> I had my partner drive me</i>
<i>to the home of Captain John Boylan.</i>

00:45.500 --> 00:46.791
<i>Your commanding officer?</i>

00:47.416 --> 00:48.541
<i>That's right.</i>

00:49.083 --> 00:50.125
<i>I had prior reason to believe</i>

00:50.208 --> 00:51.833
<i>that Captain Boylan</i>
<i>was intentionally burying</i>

00:51.916 --> 00:53.458
<i>the murder investigation</i>
<i>of Gloria Weisnewski--</i>

00:53.541 --> 00:56.541
<i>Mr. Spenser,</i>
<i>please focus on the events that transpired</i>

00:56.625 --> 00:58.500
<i>-on the afternoon of March 20th.</i>

01:00.666 --> 01:02.791
<i>I confronted</i>
<i>Captain Boylan in his home</i>

01:02.875 --> 01:05.541
<i>and attempted to question him</i>
<i>about the investigation.</i>

01:06.916 --> 01:08.708
The hell are you doing here?

01:09.416 --> 01:10.916
<i>And the ensuing argument...</i>

01:11.000 --> 01:12.541
Can't wait outside
the front door?

01:12.625 --> 01:15.500
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>everybody knows what happened.</i>

01:16.833 --> 01:18.166
Get out of our house!

01:18.250 --> 01:20.375
Hey! Get out of here.
Get the fuck out of our house--

01:21.916 --> 01:25.875
<i>At all times, I knew that these</i>
<i>actions were in violation of the law</i>

01:25.958 --> 01:30.375
<i>and the code of conduct that I swore</i>
<i>to obey as a Boston police officer.</i>

01:30.458 --> 01:33.166
<i>So, it is my understanding</i>
<i>that you are pleading guilty</i>

01:33.250 --> 01:35.500
<i>to the charge of disturbing the peace?</i>

01:35.583 --> 01:36.583
<i>Yes, Your Honor.</i>

01:37.166 --> 01:40.208
<i>How do you plead on the count</i>
<i>of harassment in the first degree?</i>

01:40.291 --> 01:41.833
- Get off him!
- <i>Guilty.</i>

01:41.916 --> 01:45.791
<i>And how do you plead on the count</i>
<i>of aggravated assault of a police officer?</i>

01:45.875 --> 01:46.750
<i>Guilty.</i>

01:46.833 --> 01:48.333
<i>Before I sentence you,</i>

01:48.416 --> 01:50.666
<i>is there anything further</i>
<i>that you would like to add?</i>

01:51.208 --> 01:53.791
<i>Yes.</i>
<i>The son of a bitch deserved it.</i>

02:31.166 --> 02:32.375
What do you say, Spense?

02:32.958 --> 02:34.791
-Hey, Squeeb.

02:34.875 --> 02:36.958
Hey, new little fun fact for you.

02:37.041 --> 02:40.208
You know, Saguaro cactus
lives for over 150 years?

02:40.291 --> 02:41.541
Now, you cut one down in Arizona,

02:41.625 --> 02:43.250
you can do a year in prison. Imagine that?

02:44.375 --> 02:45.791
Shit.

02:45.875 --> 02:47.625
I know guys that rob people in here

02:47.708 --> 02:49.375
-doin' less time than that.
- Right?

02:50.791 --> 02:52.125
How does it feel gettin' out?

02:52.208 --> 02:54.708
I haven't slept in a few nights.
But other than that...

02:54.791 --> 02:57.208
How you doin', Squeeb? How you feelin'?

02:58.250 --> 02:59.791
I feel like a lifer.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.958
You know, a lot of guys feel that way.

03:02.583 --> 03:03.750
But you're different.

03:03.833 --> 03:06.250
How many cops get to do
their time in gen pop?

03:08.000 --> 03:09.250
Zero.

03:10.166 --> 03:11.541
I can't think of one.

03:12.375 --> 03:16.333
But, I mean, that's probably why
you're so popular in here.

03:16.416 --> 03:19.250
I'm popular? Wow, I had no idea.

03:20.208 --> 03:21.625
What're you gonna do
when you get out?

03:22.666 --> 03:24.208
Back in the real world?

03:24.291 --> 03:26.458
Yeah. Go to Fenway Park,

03:26.541 --> 03:29.583
you know, get a big-ass, juicy rib eye.

03:29.666 --> 03:30.916
You got a girl, right?

03:31.000 --> 03:33.041
I got a girl. Her name is Pearl.

03:33.125 --> 03:35.750
Yeah, I'm probably just gonna
lay down in my bed

03:35.833 --> 03:37.083
and let her lick me all over.

03:38.041 --> 03:41.708
Pearl. Sounds like an old lady's name, no?

03:42.291 --> 03:45.666
You know, she's a little older.
She makes up for it in loyalty.

03:49.416 --> 03:50.791
'Sup, bookworm?

03:51.416 --> 03:52.375
Not much.

03:53.250 --> 03:55.250
How's Aryan Nation treatin' everybody?

03:55.333 --> 03:57.500
State of the Union still strong?

04:00.166 --> 04:04.541
You know, we just wanna
let you know how important it is

04:04.625 --> 04:06.916
that you're gettin' out of Boston
and never comin' back,

04:07.000 --> 04:10.041

04:10.125 --> 04:13.333
Yeah, we have a little, uh,
goin' away message for you.

04:13.416 --> 04:14.625
For me?

04:15.416 --> 04:17.833
Well, can't be from the guys in here.

04:17.916 --> 04:19.000
They like me, right?

04:20.041 --> 04:21.833
So, who's sending the message?

04:25.333 --> 04:27.083

Why don't you get some new material?

05:42.208 --> 05:44.291
-I'll see you in about a month or less.
-Have a nice day.

05:48.041 --> 05:51.041
Hey, you wanna do me a favor
when you start that truck driving class?

05:51.125 --> 05:53.291

06:27.166 --> 06:30.125
Wow. Riviera hasn't aged a day.
You gonna let me drive?

06:30.208 --> 06:31.125
You remember how?

06:33.875 --> 06:35.708
Oh, shit! Get in the car! Hurry up!

06:35.791 --> 06:37.416
-Why? What's up? Why?
-Come on, I don't want her to see me.

06:37.500 --> 06:39.416
Hurry up! Come on, let's go!

06:40.750 --> 06:43.250
What are you doing?
She drove all this way to see you.

06:44.250 --> 06:45.791
Five years in prison?

06:46.500 --> 06:47.666
- Hey!

06:48.541 --> 06:53.125
Why can't you just stay out of
other people's businesses, huh?

07:04.291 --> 07:05.708
- Oh, the other side.
-What are we doin'? You--

07:05.791 --> 07:08.041
Shut up! I'm not ready to see her yet.

07:09.166 --> 07:10.916
You know, she came
all this way to see you.

07:11.000 --> 07:12.875
Henry, I'm just not ready.

07:12.958 --> 07:16.416
Heart made of granite 'cause
I find out from someone at the car wash

07:16.500 --> 07:17.708
that he got out of prison today?

07:17.791 --> 07:18.958
-Ma'am, I can't help you with that.
-No?

07:19.041 --> 07:20.583

Now it's worth $1,500,000 per floor.

08:28.625 --> 08:31.000
Sell it, live the dream.
Come to Arizona with me.

08:31.083 --> 08:34.125
Nah.
My dream is to die in my bed, right here.

08:34.208 --> 08:35.291
- Spenser!

08:37.583 --> 08:38.833
What's up, Driscoll?

08:38.916 --> 08:41.375
- Spenser. Come here.
-What's up?

08:44.541 --> 08:47.041
I'm sorry I couldn't visit you
more at Walpole, brother.

08:47.125 --> 08:48.791
Look, I'm glad you came up.

08:48.875 --> 08:50.875
And I really appreciate
you sendin' me the books. It's all good.

08:50.958 --> 08:52.125
I brought you a gift.

08:52.958 --> 08:55.375
-Donuts?
-I wanna keep you on your toes.

08:55.458 --> 08:57.083
-Hey.

08:58.291 --> 08:59.916
Impressive how you did your time.

09:00.625 --> 09:01.916
As a former police officer,

09:02.000 --> 09:04.041
I was very, very popular in there.
That's for sure.

09:04.958 --> 09:08.583
Man. So, what's next?
That's the big question.

09:08.666 --> 09:11.166
Look, I'm gettin outta here, you know?

09:11.250 --> 09:13.708
There ain't shit for me here.
I'm gonna drive a semi, you know?

09:13.791 --> 09:15.416
Look at sunsets. Shit like that.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.000
Ah, maybe it's for the best.

09:18.083 --> 09:20.708
There's still a lot of cops around here
who'd love to put a mark on you.

09:20.791 --> 09:23.208
Well, I get in a hassle,
I know who to call.

09:23.291 --> 09:24.583
That's fuckin' right.

09:25.083 --> 09:27.916
All right, man, welcome home, brother.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.583
I love you. Nice to see you, brother.

09:31.208 --> 09:33.166
How you doin' today, Mr. Cimoli?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.083
I'm good.

09:37.958 --> 09:40.250
-Say hi to Irene and the boys.
-You got it.

09:41.666 --> 09:43.291
Let's go see your girlfriend.

09:44.916 --> 09:45.958
Pearl.

09:46.583 --> 09:49.333
Pearly, baby. Hey.

09:50.041 --> 09:50.916
Pearly.

09:52.166 --> 09:54.458
Henry, she won't even look at me.

09:54.541 --> 09:55.625
She gave me the cold shoulder.

09:55.708 --> 09:59.250
Baby, I'm sorry that I was gone.
I know five years is way too long.

09:59.958 --> 10:01.791
Thirty-five years from her perspective.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.250
No more cold winters for you.

10:03.916 --> 10:05.625
You're gonna keep your
little paws in the desert,

10:05.708 --> 10:08.291
you're gonna chase little
bunny rabbits in the sand. Huh?

10:08.375 --> 10:10.250
There's no bunny rabbits in Arizona.

10:10.333 --> 10:12.500
They got snakes and scorpions.
She wouldn't last a week.

10:12.583 --> 10:14.333
You gotta shut the fuck up, okay?

10:14.416 --> 10:15.916
I'm just tryin' to have a moment here

10:16.000 --> 10:18.375
and apologize
for my absence to my baby girl.

10:18.458 --> 10:20.708
We're gonna go to Arizona, all right?

10:21.333 --> 10:23.583
I'm gonna drive a truck
and I'm never gonna let you go.

10:23.666 --> 10:25.500
I'll have one hand on the wheel
and the other hand on you.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.666
We'll put a little bed
right beside my chair.

10:27.750 --> 10:30.541
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

10:30.625 --> 10:31.583
Baby, you got the breath.

10:31.666 --> 10:32.875
Didn't I tell you to buy the Greenies?

10:32.958 --> 10:35.291
You didn't get her
the dog biscuits for her breath?

10:35.375 --> 10:37.333
Uh, I'm going inside.

10:38.833 --> 10:41.791
Hey, thank you
for my very own room.

11:50.000 --> 11:50.833
Yo!

11:54.541 --> 11:55.458
Henry!

11:56.250 --> 11:57.791
-What?
-You said I had my own room.

11:58.375 --> 12:01.458
Hawk, this is Spenser.
Spenser, this is Hawk.

12:01.541 --> 12:03.458
You two are gonna be roommates.

12:03.541 --> 12:06.125
Toilets are flushed at all times.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.583
Food is labelled.

12:07.666 --> 12:08.833
No fighting in the house

12:08.916 --> 12:11.833
and if there's going to be
any drinking, I instigate it.

12:11.916 --> 12:13.958
Now, I'd like you two
to get to know each other.

12:45.583 --> 12:49.291
There's my girl.

12:50.166 --> 12:51.250
Yes.

12:52.541 --> 12:55.083
You love Daddy. You love Daddy, don't you?

12:57.708 --> 13:01.416
Who's a big monster, huh? Who's a monster?

13:01.500 --> 13:02.875
Ooh.

13:03.458 --> 13:04.291
Give me my dog.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.208
Give me the dog. Come on.

13:12.916 --> 13:15.708
Come here, baby. Come here.

13:17.708 --> 13:21.416
There. You're gonna stay here
with Daddy. Okay?

13:25.458 --> 13:26.708
<i>Can you talk</i>
<i>to your daughter?</i>

13:26.791 --> 13:27.958
Put her on and I'll talk to her.

13:28.041 --> 13:28.875
<i>Hi, Daddy.</i>

13:28.958 --> 13:30.166
Hey! Hey, sweetheart.

13:30.250 --> 13:32.125
<i>Dad, I really need</i>
<i>your help with my report.</i>

13:32.208 --> 13:34.750
I was straight A's in English.
I'll help you with the paper.

13:34.833 --> 13:37.041
<i>That'd be awesome, Dad.</i>
<i>Are you gonna be home soon?</i>

13:37.125 --> 13:40.458
When I get there, I'll read what you have
so far and we'll talk about it.

13:40.541 --> 13:41.541
-Oh, sweetheart,

13:41.625 --> 13:43.416
hold on a second, I got another call.

13:43.916 --> 13:44.875
<i>Boylan, are you there?</i>

13:45.458 --> 13:46.291
I'm here, what's up?

13:46.916 --> 13:49.541
<i>He wants to meet everyone</i>
<i>at the bus yard ASAP.</i>

13:50.125 --> 13:53.166
-What the fuck is this all about?
- <i>Just be there.</i>

13:53.916 --> 13:55.333
All right.

13:56.125 --> 13:59.291
Sweetheart, yeah, listen,
I got a little bit of bad news.

13:59.375 --> 14:01.875
- <i>Dad--</i>
-No, it's not... It's nothing.

14:01.958 --> 14:04.666
I'm gonna be about 15, 20 minutes late.
I just got a call.

14:05.750 --> 14:07.333
<i>You know this report's a big deal.</i>

14:07.416 --> 14:08.666
<i>I need you to read it one more time.</i>

14:08.750 --> 14:10.500
Listen, the thing about the book,

14:11.208 --> 14:15.041
you've written all this beautiful stuff
about the darkness, about winter falling,

14:15.125 --> 14:18.958
about the darkness inside the place,
the darkness in Zenobia's heart.

14:19.041 --> 14:21.041
Just stay with that idea

14:21.125 --> 14:22.833
-and take it all the way through.
<i>-Really?</i>

14:22.916 --> 14:25.291
I think it's a beautiful idea.
I really do.

14:25.375 --> 14:27.458
-I think you should have confidence.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

14:27.541 --> 14:29.916
Now, I read the first draft
and I gave you some notes.

14:30.000 --> 14:32.333
But basically, what I'm tellin' you,
you turn that thing in,

14:32.416 --> 14:34.125
you probably get an A on the first draft.

14:34.208 --> 14:35.500
<i>But I know I'm not--</i>

14:46.833 --> 14:49.041
<i>-Dad, what happened? Dad?</i>

14:50.041 --> 14:51.125
<i>Dad!</i>

14:54.083 --> 14:56.041
- <i>Dad, what was that?</i>

14:57.500 --> 14:59.916
-Get the fuck off me! Get the fuck off!
<i>-Daddy!</i>

15:00.000 --> 15:02.083
-You know who you're dealing with?
<i>-Daddy!</i>

15:02.166 --> 15:04.916
You can't do this to a cop.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.750
<i>-Dad!</i>
-I'm a fuckin' cop.

15:08.041 --> 15:08.958
I'm a fuckin' cop.

15:12.291 --> 15:13.958
You talked
to the wrong people, asshole.

15:16.666 --> 15:18.041
I didn't give anything!

15:18.125 --> 15:19.916
I swear to God I didn't give anything!

15:20.000 --> 15:21.750
I didn't give a fuckin' thing.

15:22.333 --> 15:24.625
I didn't give 'em anything. I swear.

15:24.708 --> 15:26.333
Please, God.

16:00.416 --> 16:04.916
<i>Good mornin', Boston.</i>
<i>Welcome to April 18th.</i>

16:05.000 --> 16:08.083
<i>We're gonna have some picnic weather</i>
<i>today, can you believe that?</i>

16:08.166 --> 16:10.500
<i>With highs in the upper sixties.</i>

16:10.583 --> 16:12.250
<i>That's right, you heard me.</i>

16:12.333 --> 16:16.875
<i>Upper sixties and zero chance</i>
<i>of rain, so pack up the kids,</i>

16:16.958 --> 16:18.416
<i>pack up the sandwiches,</i>

16:18.500 --> 16:21.000
<i>and pour yourself some luscious lemonade,</i>

16:21.083 --> 16:24.000
<i>because it's spring time</i>
<i>in Boston, people.</i>

16:24.083 --> 16:26.708
<i>And have yourself a wonderful day.</i>

16:30.500 --> 16:33.250
<i>Next stop is Fifth Street,</i>
<i>in five minutes.</i>

17:03.166 --> 17:04.291
What the hell?

17:10.791 --> 17:11.791
Terry?

17:14.041 --> 17:15.041
Terrence?

17:16.375 --> 17:17.750
What happened to the...

17:27.458 --> 17:28.625
Terrence!

17:31.875 --> 17:33.791
Oh, my God!

17:33.875 --> 17:36.250
Oh, my God, somebody help me.

17:43.000 --> 17:44.416
Terrence!

17:45.208 --> 17:46.541
Terry!

17:51.375 --> 17:54.958
Are you fuckin' with me? Are you?

18:04.291 --> 18:06.916
Hey. He snores.

18:08.041 --> 18:09.041
What happened here?

18:09.125 --> 18:11.166
Oh, a little going away present.

18:11.250 --> 18:13.166
I got groceries for you.

18:13.791 --> 18:16.666
Don't eat anything on the right side
of the fridge. It belongs to Hawk.

18:16.750 --> 18:18.250
Aw, do you got any real food?

18:18.875 --> 18:21.166
Frankfurters are mine.
The rest is his.

18:21.250 --> 18:23.000
Where's the giant?

18:23.083 --> 18:25.333
Gets up at five, starts running.

18:25.416 --> 18:26.458
We got no milk.

18:26.541 --> 18:29.791
There's some oatmeal milk in there,
but it belongs to Hawk.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.583
Oat milk? What the fuck is that?

18:32.458 --> 18:35.416
Who knows? All I know is
he drinks it all the time.

18:36.458 --> 18:37.583
What? Do you have to put somethin' in it?

18:37.666 --> 18:38.625
Well, what would you put in it?

18:38.708 --> 18:40.250
I don't know, Henry. Take a wild guess.

18:40.333 --> 18:41.958
Maybe water or milk or somethin'.

18:42.041 --> 18:44.833
If you put milk in it,
you might as well use milk.

18:44.916 --> 18:48.916
<i>It's been confirmed that the victim</i>
<i>is Boston Police Captain John Boylan.</i>

18:49.000 --> 18:53.041
<i>Unofficial sources have described it</i>
<i>as an execution-style killing.</i>

18:53.125 --> 18:54.208
<i>No arrests have been made.</i>

18:54.291 --> 18:55.625
<i>-Back to you in the studio.</i>
-Holy shit.

18:55.708 --> 18:57.958
<i>Thank you for that.</i>
<i>There is a city-wide manhunt...</i>

18:58.041 --> 19:00.333
Jesus Christ. Somebody killed Boylan?

19:01.500 --> 19:02.416
Was it you?

19:02.500 --> 19:03.916
<i>Police are being tight-lipped</i>
<i>on the case so far,</i>

19:04.000 --> 19:07.000
<i>but witnesses say</i>
<i>they saw a dark blue SUV...</i>

19:07.083 --> 19:09.333
Son of a bitch,
they finally killed Boylan.

19:15.958 --> 19:17.583
You wanna guess who that could be?

19:18.166 --> 19:19.208
I can see 'em.

19:19.291 --> 19:21.500
-That's pretty quick, huh?
-Yeah.

19:21.583 --> 19:22.458
Wow.

19:35.083 --> 19:36.625
Well, this is a surprise.

19:36.708 --> 19:39.958
Yeah. Sorry, Spense, I gotta ask you.

19:40.625 --> 19:41.708
Where were you last night?

19:42.833 --> 19:44.208
You know how it is.

19:44.958 --> 19:47.041
Captain Boylan dies
the same night that you get out.

19:47.125 --> 19:48.708
You're on the top of the suspect list.

19:49.291 --> 19:51.291
He was right here. I tucked him in myself.

19:51.375 --> 19:55.166
Not only that, he's got a roommate
that was sleepin' ten feet away from him.

19:55.250 --> 19:57.791
That's more like three feet,
Henry, but thank you very much.

19:57.875 --> 20:01.416
All right.
An alibi's a beautiful thing. Let's go.

20:02.041 --> 20:03.875
- That's it?
-Yep.

20:08.833 --> 20:10.750
If it turns out I like you for this,

20:11.333 --> 20:13.500
the DA will pop the old guy's story
like a balloon.

20:13.583 --> 20:15.375
John Boylan was a good cop.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.958
You should tell that to Mrs. Boylan.

20:18.041 --> 20:19.750
At least with him dead,
she can stay out of the emergency room.

20:19.833 --> 20:22.166
-Help me help you.
-You know what, big mouth?

20:22.958 --> 20:25.333
I graduated the Academy
two years after you did.

20:25.416 --> 20:27.041
And I work Homicide.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.416
I wear a suit and carry a gold shield.

20:29.500 --> 20:30.500
Who the hell are you?

20:30.583 --> 20:32.125
-Nothing.
-Okay, let's go.

20:32.208 --> 20:35.750
An ex-con. I'm livin' your dream life,
you piece of shit.

20:35.833 --> 20:36.791
Enough!

20:37.416 --> 20:40.250
Man's got an alibi. Let's go.

20:49.291 --> 20:51.250
Sorry, Spense. You're on the list.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.833
This Boylan thing...
It's, uh... It's a problem.

20:55.916 --> 20:58.250
It's a real problem.
You're lucky you're going to Arizona.

20:58.833 --> 21:01.208
Wish I was goin' with you, man. Shit.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.208
Say hi to that cactus for me.

21:04.875 --> 21:06.916
Get in the car, man. It's over. Stop.

21:09.833 --> 21:10.750
Shit.

21:20.083 --> 21:21.333
Welcome home.

21:22.625 --> 21:24.208
Come on, I'll make you somethin'.

21:28.833 --> 21:32.375
<i>Police Chief John Boylan</i>
<i>was found dead early this morning,</i>

21:32.458 --> 21:37.083
<i>in what sources are calling</i>
<i>"a gruesome execution-style murder."</i>

21:37.166 --> 21:40.416
<i>Captain Boylan is a 22-year veteran</i>
<i>of the Boston PD.</i>

21:40.500 --> 21:44.500
<i>This, from Boston Mayor</i>
<i>Marty Langs just moments ago.</i>

21:44.583 --> 21:48.375
<i>When a police officer gets killed,</i>
<i>it's a death that hits us all.</i>

21:48.458 --> 21:51.666
<i>It is the death of</i>
<i>a family member for all of us.</i>

21:51.750 --> 21:55.541
<i>Today, every citizen of Boston</i>
<i>has lost a family member.</i>

21:55.625 --> 21:57.833
<i>And we grieve together as a family.</i>

21:57.916 --> 21:59.541
<i>-We will heal--</i>

22:44.125 --> 22:45.500
Hey! Wait! You!

22:45.583 --> 22:48.541
What the hell's the matter with you?
Can't you read?

22:49.291 --> 22:50.416
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:51.333 --> 22:52.750
You here for the school?

22:52.833 --> 22:54.541
I didn't see the sign there. Yeah.

22:54.625 --> 22:55.500
Well, there's a sign.

22:55.583 --> 22:57.583
-Can't you read? Get in.
-Okay. I'm sorry about that.

22:57.666 --> 22:59.375
-Yeah.
-Beautiful truck.

22:59.458 --> 23:01.458
She is. Her name is Black Betty.

23:01.541 --> 23:03.833
First rule in this class
is to take everything you've learned

23:03.916 --> 23:06.250
about being in a four-wheeler
and flush it down the toilet.

23:06.333 --> 23:10.083
Your hands and feet are in charge
of 80,000 pounds of fast moving steel

23:10.166 --> 23:13.375
and you must be the smartest person
on the road at all times.

23:13.458 --> 23:16.125
You need to be awake,
you need to be alert and in charge.

23:16.208 --> 23:19.458
You mess up, and a mini-van
with three sleeping kids,

23:19.541 --> 23:21.250
and they get flattened like a pancake.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.250
And nowadays, there are all
these cameras everywhere.

23:23.333 --> 23:25.041
You're not gonna get away with it.

23:25.125 --> 23:27.750
Now let's get to today's lesson, okay?

23:39.416 --> 23:40.625
Any questions?

23:41.458 --> 23:44.000
Any questions? Any questions?

23:52.666 --> 23:54.041
-Hey, Spenser.
-Hey.

23:54.125 --> 23:55.708
Cissy called a bunch of times.

23:55.791 --> 23:57.583
-How many times?
-Like 22 times.

23:57.666 --> 23:59.208
-Twenty-three times.

23:59.291 --> 24:00.708
I'm not here, okay?

24:00.791 --> 24:01.875
He's not here.

24:01.958 --> 24:04.833
Quit fuckin' around.
I want you to take a look at Hawk.

24:10.583 --> 24:13.333
This kid is raw,
but I think he's got a lot of talent.

24:13.416 --> 24:14.833
I think he could be somethin' special.

24:28.625 --> 24:29.916
- Time!

24:30.500 --> 24:33.458
-You punch like a bitch.
-What the fuck?

24:33.541 --> 24:36.708
- Hey! Time! Time!
- Say that fuckin' shit again!

24:38.625 --> 24:41.041
Hey, hey! Break it up! Break it up!

24:41.666 --> 24:42.875
Get him outta there!

24:46.333 --> 24:47.833
Get him outta there!

24:47.916 --> 24:51.375
Get him the hell outta here! Out, out!

24:53.500 --> 24:54.458
Get him out!

24:55.666 --> 24:57.291
Get the fuck off me, man!

25:03.041 --> 25:05.416
Hey. You're a fighter, all right?

25:05.500 --> 25:07.041
You gotta be able to control yourself.

25:07.125 --> 25:09.541
Henry, this guy doesn't
even know how to throw a punch.

25:09.625 --> 25:11.083
You hear him?
Haven't I been tellin' you that?

25:11.166 --> 25:13.166
That you don't know
how to throw a punch?

25:13.250 --> 25:14.666
How about I kick you
in the fuckin'--

25:14.750 --> 25:18.375
There'll be no kicking
till you learn how to punch.

25:20.041 --> 25:21.416
He's gonna teach you.

25:21.500 --> 25:23.166
- I'm not workin' with him.
- Yeah, you are.

25:23.250 --> 25:24.708
- I'm not. No.
- You are.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.166
-I want you to work with me.
-I'm not doing it.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.833
-I'm asking you to do it.
-I don't give a shit.

25:28.625 --> 25:30.166
One, two.

25:30.750 --> 25:32.416
Hey, hey. Just punch, all right?

25:32.500 --> 25:33.833
Keep your feet on the ground.

25:34.416 --> 25:35.875
Throw a hook. Let me see a hook.

25:37.833 --> 25:38.666
Uppercut.

25:41.791 --> 25:43.083
Oh, my God.

25:43.166 --> 25:44.833
All right, no, no.

25:44.916 --> 25:46.333
Dude, stop, stop.

25:48.166 --> 25:51.000
Hips. You gotta turn the hips,
all right? Turn the hips.

25:51.083 --> 25:53.375
Boom. Turn, turn, turn.

25:53.458 --> 25:55.458
-Turn. Turn.
-Like that?

25:55.541 --> 25:58.208
Yeah. You don't need muscle
to knock somebody out.

25:59.416 --> 26:02.291
Spenser.
Incoming. Incoming!

26:02.375 --> 26:03.583
Where is he?

26:06.375 --> 26:08.125
<i>♪ Mississippi Queen ♪</i>

26:10.333 --> 26:11.333
Oh, shit.

26:12.166 --> 26:14.250
I waited all this time.
I gotta come find you here?

26:14.333 --> 26:15.625
Can we talk over here for a sec--

26:15.708 --> 26:17.583
Just come and talk with me
for a second, please?

26:17.666 --> 26:19.875
No. I'm gonna talk,
you are gonna listen.

26:19.958 --> 26:22.125
-Don't keep backin' me up, okay? I...
-You don't like it?

26:22.208 --> 26:24.500
-You don't like the way this feels?
-Cut the shit.

26:24.583 --> 26:26.333
-You know what I think?
- What?

26:26.416 --> 26:27.958
I think you like it in there
so much, you come here.

26:28.041 --> 26:31.166
Bunch of grown men slappin' and ticklin'
each other like fuckin' gorillas.

26:31.250 --> 26:34.541
I'm in here working.
I'm tryin' to better my life. That's it.

26:34.625 --> 26:35.916
And you stopped coming to see me.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.750
What's the problem?
I thought you moved on.

26:37.833 --> 26:39.416
You were in prison!

26:39.500 --> 26:41.583
-What was I supposed to do? Wait?
-Yeah.

26:41.666 --> 26:42.666
With no ring?

26:42.750 --> 26:45.583
Goin' up there every week
so we could have riveting conversations,

26:45.666 --> 26:46.708
like, how much I missed your cock?

26:46.791 --> 26:48.500
No, I just figured you moved on.

26:48.583 --> 26:51.291
What you're calling "move on"
is me just living.

26:51.375 --> 26:53.250
I am a very successful--

26:53.333 --> 26:55.375
-Keep turning your hips, bro.
-Look at me when I'm talking to you.

26:55.458 --> 26:57.625
I'm a very successful
small business owner.

26:57.708 --> 27:00.250
People line up around
the block to work with me.

27:00.333 --> 27:02.750
I got poodles comin' out of my ass.
Everybody wants to work--

27:02.833 --> 27:04.708
Excuse me,
Miss Davis. Spenser's working.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.166
Maybe you could talk to him later?

27:06.250 --> 27:08.791
-What? Are you his bodyguard now?
-It's okay.

27:08.875 --> 27:11.333
Look, look. Look at me.
Look at me. Listen, okay?

27:12.875 --> 27:16.541
I'm sorry. All right? I am. I mean it.

27:18.458 --> 27:21.000
You are incapable of real intimacy.

27:21.083 --> 27:24.375
And I came here to tell you
I never wanna see you again.

27:29.208 --> 27:30.666
Bye. All right.

27:31.375 --> 27:33.791
Energy in, energy out.

27:50.583 --> 27:52.958
Henry?
He's a very strange person.

27:53.041 --> 27:53.875
Thanks.

27:53.958 --> 27:56.416
<i>...identified the body of</i>
<i>the male found in this SUV behind me</i>

27:56.500 --> 27:59.875
<i>as Boston Police Detective</i>
<i>Terrence Graham.</i>

27:59.958 --> 28:02.458
<i>Thank you. I understand</i>
<i>Graham is now the lead suspect</i>

28:02.541 --> 28:04.958
<i>in the murder case of</i>
<i>Boston Police Captain John Boylan.</i>

28:05.041 --> 28:06.083
I know that kid.

28:06.875 --> 28:09.208
<i>Terrence Graham's</i>
<i>death was by gunshot</i>

28:09.291 --> 28:11.583
<i>and we're hearing that</i>
<i>that gunshot was self-inflicted.</i>

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
There's no way.

28:14.083 --> 28:15.875
This kid was a good kid, Henry. Clean.

28:15.958 --> 28:17.875
I was in tactical training with him.

28:18.625 --> 28:20.708
I've never seen somebody as happy as him.

28:21.333 --> 28:23.500
Married, pregnant wife.

28:24.291 --> 28:26.458
There's no way he's taking his own life.

28:28.083 --> 28:31.916
<i>Graham worked in the narcotics</i>
<i>division with Captain John Boylan</i>

28:32.000 --> 28:36.166
<i>who, just hours before,</i>
<i>was found dead in a South Boston bus yard.</i>

28:36.250 --> 28:38.750
<i>Now,</i>
<i>police believe Terrence Graham</i>

28:38.833 --> 28:42.458
<i>viciously murdered Captain Boylan</i>
<i>and are calling it a murder-suicide.</i>

28:42.541 --> 28:43.708
That's dark.

28:43.791 --> 28:44.666
<i>A murder this city</i>

28:44.750 --> 28:47.291
<i>-is trying to come to grips with.</i>
-Wow. That's convenient.

28:48.375 --> 28:49.708
Ah, what the hell difference does it make?

28:49.791 --> 28:51.958
You're gonna be in Arizona,
drivin' a truck.

28:52.875 --> 28:56.166
That's right, Henry.
It's none of my business.

28:57.500 --> 29:01.083
<i>Officer Graham is survived</i>
<i>by his wife Letitia and their son Rowan.</i>

29:01.583 --> 29:05.083
<i>What you're saying is not true!</i>
<i>Terrence was a good policeman!</i>

29:05.833 --> 29:08.125
<i>Why doesn't anyone know</i>
<i>what's happening?</i>

29:08.208 --> 29:10.250
<i>He was a good husband!</i>
<i>He was a good father!</i>

29:10.333 --> 29:12.375
<i>What's going on?</i>
<i>Tell me what's really happening!</i>

29:12.458 --> 29:13.750
Don't do it, Spense.

29:13.833 --> 29:15.958
- <i>Don't tell me to calm down!</i>
- Let it go. Walk away.

29:16.041 --> 29:19.708
<i>Why? Why? Why? Why? </i>

29:37.958 --> 29:38.833
Mrs. Graham?

29:40.083 --> 29:41.041
Mrs. Graham!

29:41.541 --> 29:43.916
Hey. Sorry...
No, I didn't mean to scare you.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.916
-What do you want?
-Sorry about that. I, uh...

29:46.708 --> 29:47.791
Look...

29:48.375 --> 29:51.125
I was, um... I was a friend of Terrence.

29:52.166 --> 29:54.458
I just wanted to talk to you for a minute.

29:54.541 --> 29:55.583
Who are you?

29:55.666 --> 29:58.541
Uh, my name is Spenser. I don't know
if Terrence told you about me.

29:58.625 --> 30:02.250
Um, I got into a situation
years ago with John Boylan.

30:02.333 --> 30:03.875
It sent me to prison for quite some time.

30:05.041 --> 30:06.125
That was you?

30:06.208 --> 30:09.833
Yeah. I just thought maybe
I could help you in some way.

30:10.416 --> 30:11.875
Help, how?

30:12.791 --> 30:15.375
Uh, I don't know, find the truth?

30:20.041 --> 30:22.375
Did your husband
have any problems with Boylan?

30:23.250 --> 30:28.416
Terry thought
Boylan was a loudmouth

30:28.500 --> 30:30.125
whose ego could fill a room.

30:31.125 --> 30:33.083
You know, old school,

30:33.166 --> 30:35.708
above the law cop
who liked to flaunt his power.

30:36.291 --> 30:37.750
Yeah, that's Boylan to a T.

30:37.833 --> 30:41.833
Boylan called Terrence
"altar boy."

30:42.416 --> 30:46.041
Did Terrence have the technical knowledge
to disable the airbag in your vehicle?

30:46.625 --> 30:47.500
Why?

30:47.583 --> 30:50.875
Well, because you can't use a vehicle as
a ram unless you can disable the airbags.

30:50.958 --> 30:54.166
Mmm-mmm. They didn't ask me that.
Why didn't they ask me that?

30:54.250 --> 30:55.625
Because they already know the answer.

30:55.708 --> 30:58.416
They found drugs in our home.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.375
- Mrs. Graham, we got a warrant.

31:00.458 --> 31:03.333
<i>They said he was dirty.</i>
<i>Said he was dealing.</i>

31:03.416 --> 31:05.041
<i>They knew right where</i>
<i>to look, didn't they?</i>

31:05.125 --> 31:05.958
Check this wall.

31:06.041 --> 31:07.291
<i>They went right up to it.</i>

31:07.375 --> 31:08.208
Jackpot.

31:08.291 --> 31:09.291
Look what we got here,
Mrs. Graham.

31:09.375 --> 31:10.875
Your husband was dealing narcotics.

31:10.958 --> 31:13.541
<i>And they said</i>
<i>they could pin me for conspiracy</i>

31:13.625 --> 31:15.250
and take my boy away.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.583
Well, believe them, okay?
They can and they will.

31:19.083 --> 31:21.250
When is the last time
you saw your husband?

31:22.291 --> 31:23.541
The night before?

31:23.625 --> 31:25.791
Terrence said he had to meet his partner.

31:25.875 --> 31:27.666
Um, Scott Traylor?

31:28.291 --> 31:31.000
And they... They went to some cop bar.

31:31.083 --> 31:32.083
Sláinte?

31:32.708 --> 31:33.541
Yeah.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.083
I know who Scott Traylor is.

31:35.166 --> 31:37.416
I'll dig up anything I can,
see if it helps.

31:39.375 --> 31:41.291
And this...

31:42.166 --> 31:45.166
-This revenge for you?
-No.

31:46.041 --> 31:48.083
My mom wasn't dealt a good hand either.

31:49.291 --> 31:53.000
But she was fierce, tough,
and she had a lot of heart.

31:54.083 --> 31:56.750
I got a lot of flaws, Mrs. Graham.
Believe me, a lot.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.916
But anything I got good in me,
it came from her.

32:03.875 --> 32:05.916
Sounds like she was a good woman.

32:08.375 --> 32:11.291
Keep an eye on your son.
I'll be in touch, okay?

32:37.000 --> 32:41.666
<i>♪ Sweet Caroline, pa, pa, pa ♪</i>

32:41.750 --> 32:45.000
<i>♪ Good times never seemed so good ♪</i>

32:45.083 --> 32:46.958
<i>♪ So good, so good ♪</i>

33:14.625 --> 33:15.541
Hmm.

33:16.041 --> 33:18.583
You Scotty Traylor?
Terrence Graham's partner?

33:21.291 --> 33:22.500
Who are you?

33:22.583 --> 33:24.875
I know Terrence didn't do
what they're pinning on him.

33:28.125 --> 33:30.791
I'm gonna go take a piss. Come see me.

33:55.041 --> 33:56.875
You know, it hit me who you are.

33:56.958 --> 34:00.000
A lot of guys in this bar,
they celebrated when you got locked up.

34:01.000 --> 34:03.375
You and I both know
Terrence was not a crooked cop.

34:05.291 --> 34:07.666
Was he in this bar
the night Boylan was killed, yes or no?

34:11.208 --> 34:13.041
Yes.

34:14.125 --> 34:16.291
And did he suspect Boylan
of bein' a dirty cop?

34:20.000 --> 34:20.833
Huh?

34:28.375 --> 34:31.000
Unbelievable. How was Walpole?

34:31.083 --> 34:33.083
Did you work your way right up
to the honeymoon suite?

34:33.166 --> 34:35.083
Wow, Patrolman Macklin.

34:35.166 --> 34:38.333
Hear how heavy you guys
are breathin' from walkin' 50 steps?

34:39.291 --> 34:40.458
What the hell are you doin' here?

34:40.541 --> 34:42.250
This isn't a bar for boy scouts.

34:42.833 --> 34:45.541
Well, I said something
insensitive to this young man

34:45.625 --> 34:46.833
who recently lost his partner

34:46.916 --> 34:49.458
and I think you guys just saved me
an ass kicking, so thank you.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.416
He didn't do nothin'. He apologized.

34:53.000 --> 34:56.333
Yeah? Did you apologize
for beatin' down your own captain?

34:56.416 --> 34:58.125
I never got the chance.

34:58.208 --> 34:59.708
Jesus Christ.

35:00.541 --> 35:01.791
The set of balls on you.

35:02.375 --> 35:05.666
I don't know if you noticed it,
but it's Sergeant Macklin now.

35:05.750 --> 35:08.625
Wow.
For you to be a sergeant,

35:08.708 --> 35:11.083
I'd say all your superiors
must be dead, no?

35:11.166 --> 35:13.208
That's impossible. So, what was it?

35:13.291 --> 35:15.000
A clerical error
or they just get a tax break

35:15.083 --> 35:17.333
hiring a mentally stunted
dickhead like yourself?

35:18.125 --> 35:19.333
Jesus, you are a prick.

35:19.416 --> 35:20.833
Thank you.

35:22.791 --> 35:25.000
Aah! Bad mother...

35:26.958 --> 35:29.958
Oh, that was good.

35:30.041 --> 35:31.833
That was good. That was real good.

35:36.875 --> 35:38.375
Come on already, will you?

35:39.750 --> 35:40.958
We're gonna cut those out.

35:42.291 --> 35:43.500
Give me that asshole.

35:51.583 --> 35:52.666
Shit! Fuck.

35:58.125 --> 35:59.541
Hey, asshole.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.833
Get the fuck out of Massachusetts.

36:01.916 --> 36:04.500
You fuckin' hear me, Spenser? You're done.

36:27.708 --> 36:28.625
See you later.

36:47.750 --> 36:50.166
-I need to use your bathroom.
-Customers only.

36:50.750 --> 36:52.916
Fine. Here.

36:54.000 --> 36:56.041
Now it's official. Give me the key.

36:56.125 --> 36:58.291
There. It's down the hall, to the right.

37:04.625 --> 37:05.458
Bingo.

37:07.041 --> 37:09.416
Dude, you can't be back here!
What are you doing?

37:09.500 --> 37:11.916
I just need the tape from your cameras.
From the other day.

37:12.000 --> 37:13.041
Oh, it's not a tape.

37:13.125 --> 37:15.833
Well, I need this hard drive!

37:15.916 --> 37:17.041
That's the cable box.

37:17.125 --> 37:18.333
-What?
-That's the cable box.

37:18.416 --> 37:19.375
Where's the hard drive?

37:19.458 --> 37:20.875
How do you get the footage
from the cameras?

37:20.958 --> 37:21.791
They're in the cloud.

37:23.291 --> 37:24.666
What the fuck is a cloud?

37:26.041 --> 37:28.166
-The cloud. Yeah...
-Listen, dude...

37:29.583 --> 37:32.166
Don't play with me right now.
Give me the cloud.

37:35.833 --> 37:39.208
Ooh, I thought you knew how to punch.

37:39.291 --> 37:42.166
-There was four of them. Okay?
-You good?

37:42.250 --> 37:43.625
Oh, no, no. I'm not good.

37:43.708 --> 37:45.041
I don't know how to work
this computer shit.

37:45.125 --> 37:45.958
Sit down, will you?

37:46.708 --> 37:47.791
Come on, please.

37:50.541 --> 37:52.458
-Thank you.

37:52.541 --> 37:54.625
Let me look at the top right camera.

37:56.166 --> 37:58.625
That's Terrence Graham's car.
It was used in the Boylan hit.

37:59.125 --> 38:01.250
Let's see what happens when he comes out.

38:04.208 --> 38:05.250
There he is.

38:11.041 --> 38:12.375
All right, hold on.

38:13.916 --> 38:15.250
Who are you meeting, Terrence?

38:15.333 --> 38:16.875
That's a Corvette Z06.

38:17.458 --> 38:18.708
Can you zoom in a little bit?

38:20.458 --> 38:22.375
It's too blurry. Shit!

38:23.125 --> 38:24.958
It means you're looking
for a fat, old, white dude

38:25.041 --> 38:27.041
with three divorces and a micro-dick.

38:27.125 --> 38:27.958
Why's that?

38:28.041 --> 38:29.791
Who else you think drives
a Corvette like that?

38:30.708 --> 38:34.250
Go back to the other camera.
Now, fast forward.

38:37.791 --> 38:40.833
Wait, wait, wait. Zoom in a little more.

38:45.750 --> 38:46.625
Let me see.

38:50.541 --> 38:51.958
So, they all left together.

38:57.125 --> 38:59.291
You got any idea
who those guys are?

38:59.375 --> 39:02.250
I don't know,
but I know where they went.

41:02.125 --> 41:05.416
One, two, uppercut.
One, two! One, two!

41:05.500 --> 41:09.000
Come on! Stick and move.
Stick and move. Stick and move.

41:09.083 --> 41:10.250
One, two, one, two.

41:11.166 --> 41:15.208
That's it. Move, move it.
That's it. Come on.

41:16.833 --> 41:17.875
Punch it.

41:19.500 --> 41:20.458
-Time.

41:20.541 --> 41:22.791
Hey, he keeps dropping
that right hand after he throws it.

41:23.500 --> 41:26.083
Spenser!
What the hell are you doing here?

41:26.166 --> 41:28.208
You thinkin' of leavin' Cimoli's?

41:28.291 --> 41:31.375
No, look, I wanted to ask you
a few questions about Terrence Graham.

41:32.250 --> 41:33.833
Man, anything seem off to you about it?

41:35.250 --> 41:38.541
Yeah. The fact that
you're askin' me about it.

41:38.625 --> 41:40.916
What are you,
a private detective now, huh?

41:41.000 --> 41:42.500
Is that what's goin' on here?

41:42.583 --> 41:44.333
'Cause I was under the impression that

41:44.416 --> 41:46.500
-a convicted felon can't get a license.

41:46.583 --> 41:48.833
With your connections,
I could probably get a pardon.

41:52.166 --> 41:54.500
Listen, let this one go.

41:55.083 --> 41:56.916
Graham's dirty, drugs in his house.

41:57.000 --> 42:00.541
Look, they said that Boylan
was killed in the school bus yard, right?

42:00.625 --> 42:02.958
And that Terrence Graham
rammed him first with his SUV?

42:03.041 --> 42:04.208
That's how he got the drop on him.

42:04.291 --> 42:06.916
Yeah, but they found his SUV
outside of his house.

42:08.791 --> 42:10.541
Then he drove himself home
and blew his brains out.

42:10.625 --> 42:11.875
You don't have
to be Sherlock Holmes here--

42:11.958 --> 42:13.250
No, the air bags should've went off.

42:13.333 --> 42:15.166
He wouldn't have been
able to drive it at all.

42:16.041 --> 42:17.541
Well, he must've disabled 'em.

42:18.625 --> 42:21.500
Yeah, but it doesn't add up.
Why drive all the way home?

42:21.583 --> 42:23.083
To shoot himself?

42:23.166 --> 42:26.208
Run the risk of his kid walkin' out
and seein' him dead in the car?

42:26.291 --> 42:29.125
Spenser, the man was not
in his right mind.

42:29.208 --> 42:30.833
And what about the crime scene?

42:30.916 --> 42:32.333
Everything added up, right?

42:33.166 --> 42:34.750
Beats me. I haven't been there.

42:42.750 --> 42:43.958
You haven't been there?

42:44.041 --> 42:45.083
What do you mean you haven't been there?

42:45.166 --> 42:46.333
No, I haven't been there.

42:46.416 --> 42:48.291
Spenser, why would I go there?
The case is closed.

42:49.416 --> 42:52.833
You're home, baby.
Let it go. Let it go, man.

42:52.916 --> 42:56.000
The only thing that it's gonna bring you
is grief, pain, frustration.

42:56.083 --> 42:57.125
Let it go.

42:58.416 --> 43:00.625
I gotta get back to work,
I ain't gettin' no younger.

43:00.708 --> 43:03.541
All right. He's right,
I'm keepin' my right hand too low.

43:04.375 --> 43:05.750
One, two! One, two!

43:06.375 --> 43:09.291
<i> Investigation</i>
<i>into the brutal double homicide</i>

43:09.375 --> 43:12.333
<i>that has rocked the city</i>
<i>of Boston continues today. </i>

43:12.416 --> 43:14.791
<i>We're hearing inside</i>
<i>the Boston Police Department,</i>

43:14.875 --> 43:17.416
<i>that Officer Terrence Graham</i>
<i>lured Captain Boylan </i>

43:17.500 --> 43:21.541
<i>to an isolated city school bus yard</i>
<i>where he killed him violently.</i>

43:21.625 --> 43:24.416
<i>It is believed Terrence Graham</i>
<i>is the only suspect.</i>

43:24.500 --> 43:25.833
Block, block, block, block...

43:25.916 --> 43:28.958
Oh, you see that? You gotta be
able to move, all right?

43:29.041 --> 43:31.416
Defense is the best offense sometimes. Go.

43:37.000 --> 43:38.291
That's pretty perfect.

43:39.250 --> 43:40.958
Do I get a shot
at drivin' the Black Betty?

43:41.041 --> 43:43.416
You're not ready, Mr. Spenser.

43:44.625 --> 43:46.500
Well, uh, she sure is a pretty truck.

43:46.583 --> 43:48.000
- There you go.

43:48.750 --> 43:50.250
Yeah. Okay. Get in.

43:53.083 --> 43:54.750
Now, block. Good.

43:54.833 --> 43:56.250
-And block, block, block.

43:56.333 --> 43:58.333
-Oh, you see that?
-Yeah.

43:58.416 --> 44:00.291
You have to listen. All right? Yeah.

44:00.375 --> 44:02.583
<i>City officials</i>
<i>are planning a funeral</i>

44:02.666 --> 44:04.625
<i>to honor the fallen Captain Boylan</i>

44:04.708 --> 44:06.708
<i>and will announce details shortly.</i>

44:08.333 --> 44:09.375
Good job.

44:10.791 --> 44:12.416
I'm gonna go get somethin' to eat.
You want somethin'?

44:17.916 --> 44:19.625
-Thank you.
-For what?

44:19.708 --> 44:21.833
The boxing. You're right, I need it.

44:21.916 --> 44:23.666
I'm just doin' what Henry asked me to do.

44:23.750 --> 44:25.875
Got one Green Goddess for the gentleman.

44:27.291 --> 44:29.708
Gonna like this a lot more than
prison food, I guarantee you.

44:29.791 --> 44:32.208
I don't know about that.
What'd you go up for?

44:33.416 --> 44:34.666
Manslaughter.

44:36.083 --> 44:38.000
Reduced from murder one.

44:38.083 --> 44:40.250
Served four years, out on good behavior.

44:40.875 --> 44:44.291
And now, thanks to Henry,
I'm changin' my life.

44:45.416 --> 44:46.291
Oh, God.

44:46.375 --> 44:49.083
I wanna be the LeBron James of MMA.

44:49.166 --> 44:50.500
-Really?
-Yeah.

44:50.583 --> 44:52.083
Wow. Yeah, that's impressive.

44:52.166 --> 44:54.083
I'm gonna use my gifts to make
a difference in the world

44:54.166 --> 44:55.166
like my dad would've wanted.

44:55.250 --> 44:56.458
Your dad, huh?

44:57.208 --> 44:58.416
What was he like?

44:59.166 --> 45:02.125
He was a good guy. Military man, pilot.

45:02.791 --> 45:04.416
Man of the world type, you know?

45:05.291 --> 45:08.500
We moved around a lot.
Settled in New Orleans.

45:09.875 --> 45:13.625
He witnessed some real
messed up shit in our community.

45:13.708 --> 45:15.791
Everybody told him to look the other way.

45:16.708 --> 45:17.750
He couldn't.

45:19.000 --> 45:21.541
He died, a hero.

45:22.458 --> 45:24.333
Not minding his own business.

45:27.458 --> 45:28.666
And what happened?

45:28.750 --> 45:30.291
I'm not gonna get into that, not with you.

45:30.375 --> 45:33.250
-Probably not ever, actually.
-Fair enough.

45:35.000 --> 45:36.750
I'm gonna go wash my hands.

45:36.833 --> 45:38.125
It's fine. Whatever you want.

45:38.208 --> 45:39.666
Yeah, chill out. Relax.

45:44.958 --> 45:46.000
Hey, what are you doin'?

45:48.791 --> 45:50.000
You followin' me?

45:51.250 --> 45:53.166
Uh, I came to the bathroom first.

45:53.250 --> 45:56.083
You followed me in here.
So, you're following me.

45:56.625 --> 45:57.791
What are you doin' in this restaurant?

45:57.875 --> 45:58.916
I came to meet a friend.

45:59.000 --> 46:00.708
-What are you doin'?
-Hmm.

46:00.791 --> 46:03.291
-Don't be ridiculous, okay?
-Don't be ridiculous.

46:03.375 --> 46:05.125
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

46:05.208 --> 46:06.833
-Don't! You know what? You...
-What?

46:06.916 --> 46:08.375
We're not doing...

46:08.458 --> 46:09.875
-We're not doing this today.
-We're not doin' what?

46:09.958 --> 46:10.875
Oh, we're just gonna go.

46:10.958 --> 46:12.166
You're the one putting your hands on me.

46:12.250 --> 46:14.125
-I'm just guiding you back to the door...
-Guiding me?

46:14.208 --> 46:15.541
-Where do you wanna guide me?
-You're blocking my path.

46:15.625 --> 46:16.458
-You locked the door.
-Where do you wanna guide me?

46:16.541 --> 46:18.291
- Stop that.
-You're the one pushin' me.

46:18.375 --> 46:20.291
What are you, the lock police?

46:20.375 --> 46:21.958
All right, you look good.
What do you want from me?

46:22.041 --> 46:25.208
I want a lot from you,
'cause guess what? You look good, too.

46:25.791 --> 46:26.833
No, you look really good.

46:26.916 --> 46:28.583
Yeah? So why don't you
do somethin' about it?

46:28.666 --> 46:30.375
How about this?
Huh? You like this?

46:30.458 --> 46:31.708
-Don't touch my fuckin' hair.
-All right.

46:31.791 --> 46:33.083
You know how I get about my hair.

46:33.166 --> 46:35.500
-I know what you like. Come here.
-You wanna show me?

46:35.583 --> 46:37.333
-Yes? All right.
-Yeah. All right. I got you.

46:37.416 --> 46:39.125
Stop, stop.

46:43.958 --> 46:44.916
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.708
-Like that?
-Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

46:50.083 --> 46:52.375
Oh, shit! Okay! Okay! Okay!

46:53.125 --> 46:54.708
Don't you dare! Don't you dare!

46:54.791 --> 46:57.625
Don't you dare
fuckin' cum before me. Okay?

46:57.708 --> 46:59.291
Fuck yeah.

46:59.375 --> 47:01.583
Cissy always finishes first!

47:01.666 --> 47:03.916
Fuck me harder!

47:04.000 --> 47:06.125
-Fuck! Fuck!
-Was that it?

47:06.208 --> 47:07.291
Go, Sox!

47:07.375 --> 47:10.125
Don't stop! Don't stop!

47:10.208 --> 47:12.000
-Don't stop!
-Oh, shit!

47:12.083 --> 47:14.041
-Oh, my fuckin' God!
-Shut up!

47:14.125 --> 47:16.250
Oh, my fuckin' God!

47:24.000 --> 47:26.041
We're in the window right now, Spenser.

47:26.875 --> 47:28.958
-What's that?
-Remember the window?

47:29.833 --> 47:31.583
You mean the five minutes
of peace between us

47:31.666 --> 47:33.583
right after we have sex? Yeah.

47:33.666 --> 47:35.375
Yeah, lasts about as long as sex with you.

47:35.458 --> 47:36.500
-Get off me.
-Yeah.

47:38.416 --> 47:40.333
Used to be my favorite part of the day.

47:40.416 --> 47:42.250
Even better than fuckin'.

47:43.333 --> 47:44.541
Well, you seem like you liked it.

47:44.625 --> 47:46.791
-What, you wanna go again?

47:52.583 --> 47:54.500
That time we thought I was pregnant.

47:54.583 --> 47:58.708
-Do you remember what you said to me?
-Um, I remember the gist.

47:59.666 --> 48:00.750
You said,

48:01.666 --> 48:03.375
"I'm not sayin' we're gettin' married,

48:04.000 --> 48:06.375
but that kid's not gonna
be raised without a father."

48:07.125 --> 48:08.541
You remember that?

48:09.125 --> 48:10.750
It was a false alarm, thank God.

48:11.916 --> 48:13.708
But you were gonna do what was right.

48:13.791 --> 48:17.875
You always had that strong moral code.

48:22.083 --> 48:23.333
I'm movin' to Arizona.

48:24.291 --> 48:26.625
I'm gonna start over. Start fresh.

48:28.666 --> 48:30.958
That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

48:31.041 --> 48:32.250
This is your home.

48:35.291 --> 48:38.333
Hell will freeze over
before you ever touch me again.

48:40.541 --> 48:44.500
You got, um... You got a little
stain on your dress there.

48:44.583 --> 48:45.833
Just sayin'.

48:45.916 --> 48:46.875
Souvenir.

48:51.958 --> 48:53.291
Fuckin'...

49:14.708 --> 49:17.750
- You enjoy yourself in there?
-Mind your business.

49:17.833 --> 49:20.041
Okay. I'll mind my business.

49:20.875 --> 49:22.333
Is that yellow Corvette my business?

49:24.375 --> 49:25.541
Shit!

49:51.541 --> 49:52.875
-Whoa!

49:55.541 --> 49:56.875
No, I'm just cutting through.

49:56.958 --> 49:59.625
No, no! Stay! Stop!

50:03.166 --> 50:04.791
-Oh, shit!

50:07.916 --> 50:09.291
Fuck!

50:09.375 --> 50:11.958
Oh, God! Get the fuck--

50:22.250 --> 50:23.750
Fuck off! God!

50:23.833 --> 50:25.458
Oh, my God!

50:40.500 --> 50:43.750
You fuckin' motherfucker...

50:47.291 --> 50:48.791
-What?

50:55.583 --> 50:57.416
Oh, shit! Fuck!

50:59.416 --> 51:00.791
-Fuck!

51:00.875 --> 51:02.833
Hey! What are you doing to my dog?

51:04.125 --> 51:05.416
Get off my dog!

51:06.000 --> 51:08.125
Lego. Come here, Lego.

51:08.625 --> 51:10.166
-Good girl. Oh...
-Fuck!

51:10.750 --> 51:12.750
Come here. Good girl.

51:12.833 --> 51:14.833
-Good girl. Aw.

51:14.916 --> 51:16.333

Huh? And worse than that,

52:54.541 --> 52:56.833

And could you clear a couple
of DUIs off my record, please?

53:25.583 --> 53:28.000
-What are you doin' here?
-Aw, hey, Billy.

53:28.083 --> 53:30.291
I need my registered
snitch to do me a favor.

53:30.875 --> 53:31.958

53:32.041 --> 53:35.041
-You're not a cop anymore, Spenser.
-That's interesting.

53:35.125 --> 53:38.250
I need to renew my dead mother's
handicapped parking permit.

53:38.333 --> 53:39.333
Keep your voice down.

And you know how the last time
I gave you $500 under the table

53:41.666 --> 53:42.833
and you wiped those DUIs off my record?

53:42.916 --> 53:44.541
-I got another one.
-Fine. Enough.

53:44.625 --> 53:46.375
I have the money you requested
in the envelope.

53:46.458 --> 53:48.041
Give me the plate.

53:48.125 --> 53:50.375
Come on, buddy. You look good.

53:50.458 --> 53:52.000
You look like you banged a mountain lion.

53:53.791 --> 53:56.500
As you can see, this is the documentation
you're gonna need.

53:57.500 --> 53:59.083
I got it. I know who he is.

54:24.875 --> 54:26.666
Tracksuit Charlie Bentwood.

54:27.166 --> 54:28.458
Irish mob throwback.

54:28.541 --> 54:31.666
Back when the Irish mob existed
outside all those shitty movies.

54:32.708 --> 54:33.583
There we go.

54:39.416 --> 54:40.250
Nice.

54:42.375 --> 54:45.708
I think it's time you tell me
what's really goin' on here.

54:46.375 --> 54:50.083
There was a girl named Gloria Weisnewski.

54:50.875 --> 54:53.083
I used to shovel snow off
her mother's porch in Southie.

54:53.791 --> 54:56.250
She was a smart kid.
I watched her grow up.

54:56.333 --> 54:58.083
When developers came to Southie,

54:58.166 --> 55:01.291
gentrifying and trying to destroy
the soul of the city,

55:01.375 --> 55:02.541
<i>she couldn't look the other way.</i>

55:02.625 --> 55:04.625

55:10.458 --> 55:12.625
Tracksuit Charlie was
and is a goon for hire.

55:12.708 --> 55:15.625
<i>Somebody paid him to harass Gloria,</i>
<i>get her to give up.</i>

55:15.708 --> 55:18.041

55:18.625 --> 55:21.125
Get your filthy,
stinkin' hands out my face!

55:21.208 --> 55:23.250
Shut your mouth or I'll shut it for you!

55:23.333 --> 55:24.208
Then it escalated.

55:25.833 --> 55:30.125
<i>Phone calls, threats, harassment.</i>

55:33.041 --> 55:35.916
<i>Next thing you know, Gloria comes home</i>
<i>and finds her cat nailed to the door.</i>

55:38.041 --> 55:39.250
It didn't take a genius to know

55:39.333 --> 55:41.083
<i>that it was Tracksuit Charlie</i>
<i>that killed Gloria's cat.</i>

55:43.833 --> 55:45.541
Couple of weeks later,
I was out on a call.

55:45.625 --> 55:47.000
Manager at Cumberland Farms

55:48.083 --> 55:50.375
<i>had a suspicious vehicle</i>
<i>in the parking lot.</i>

55:53.041 --> 55:55.041
There was blood leaking from the trunk.

56:14.458 --> 56:17.250
We got a...

56:17.333 --> 56:18.416
<i>I had to tell her mother.</i>

56:20.375 --> 56:22.250
<i>It was almost worse than finding the body.</i>

56:23.125 --> 56:24.291
-I got you.

56:30.375 --> 56:32.250
I don't know,
I was so close to the family.

56:32.333 --> 56:34.750
They were good, honest people,
so I just kept checkin' in.

56:35.333 --> 56:36.708
Got handed over to Homicide.

56:37.541 --> 56:39.166
But I couldn't let it go.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.375
<i>When I followed up on Gloria's case,</i>

56:42.458 --> 56:44.666
<i>I found out Homicide</i>
<i>was just sittin' on it.</i>

56:44.750 --> 56:47.000
<i>They hadn't even questioned</i>
<i>Tracksuit Charlie.</i>

56:48.041 --> 56:49.916
-Lieutenant.
-Sergeant, what are you doing here?

56:50.000 --> 56:51.000
I need to speak with you
outside for a minute.

56:51.083 --> 56:52.458
We're in the middle of somethin'.

56:52.541 --> 56:53.375
This is very important.

56:53.458 --> 56:55.500
It's in your best interest
that you step outside and talk to me.

56:55.583 --> 56:57.958
I will actually judge
what's in my best interest

56:58.041 --> 57:00.041
and you need to start thinking
about what's your best interest.

57:00.125 --> 57:02.041
Sergeant, get your ass outta here.
You get out of here now.

57:02.125 --> 57:03.166
We're in the middle of something.

57:03.250 --> 57:06.208
Are you in the middle of
investigating Gloria Weisnewski's murder?

57:06.291 --> 57:08.791
'Cause you should be,
but you're burying it. Why?

57:09.958 --> 57:13.083
I think you should step outside
and mind your step, son.

57:13.166 --> 57:14.875
-Really?
-Yeah, you really do.

57:15.750 --> 57:16.583
Listen...

57:16.666 --> 57:18.750
Don't touch me. Don't touch me, okay?

57:18.833 --> 57:19.916
-Wake up!
-Get out of here.

57:20.000 --> 57:21.416
-Get him outta here!
- Let's go.

57:21.500 --> 57:24.875
<i>I should've walked away,</i>
<i>but I knew he was covering something up.</i>

57:24.958 --> 57:26.416
Get out, you piece of shit.

57:30.958 --> 57:33.458
And then I get a call
from this reporter at the <i>Globe,</i>

57:33.541 --> 57:35.833
<i>and he wants to show me</i>
<i>this very graphic tape.</i>

57:37.625 --> 57:39.458
Has Homicide seen this tape?

57:39.541 --> 57:41.541
Yeah, a secretary leaked it to me.

57:42.083 --> 57:43.708
It's Gloria Weisnewski.

57:43.791 --> 57:46.833
Word is, those animals were part
of the Trinitario drug gang.

57:47.541 --> 57:50.291
They haven't even questioned
the guys workin' the lot yet.

57:50.958 --> 57:53.416
-What?
-You wanna hear the extent of the sandbag?

57:53.500 --> 57:55.708
<i>Globe's</i> not gonna run it.
They're putting me on another story.

57:55.791 --> 57:58.291
-So what're they hiding?
-I was hoping you could tell me that.

57:58.375 --> 57:59.833
This is fucked up, man.

57:59.916 --> 58:01.958
Tracksuit must have put them on it.

58:11.541 --> 58:12.666
Fuckin' Boylan.

58:17.916 --> 58:19.416
Hey, one flash behind.

58:20.000 --> 58:21.125
One flash behind you, baby.

58:42.541 --> 58:44.125
What are you doing here?

58:44.208 --> 58:45.666
I have some urgent questions
for you, John.

58:45.750 --> 58:47.833
Jesus. Just walk right in. What questions?

58:47.916 --> 58:49.250
Know Wayne Cosgrove,
reporter for the Globe?

58:49.333 --> 58:50.500
No, I don't know who that is.

58:50.583 --> 58:51.916
He showed me the tape.

58:52.000 --> 58:53.458
-What tape?
-The tape of Gloria Weisnewski

58:53.541 --> 58:54.750
being murdered in the parking lot.

58:54.833 --> 58:55.916
The tape that you are burying.

58:56.000 --> 58:57.375
What tape? I don't know
what you're talking about.

58:57.458 --> 58:59.208
-Don't play stupid with me.
-I'm not playing stupid.

58:59.291 --> 59:00.958
-Not in your own home.
-Don't talk to me like that in my house!

59:01.041 --> 59:02.583
-Are you drunk right now?
-It doesn't matter.

59:02.666 --> 59:04.458
It's eight o'clock on a Saturday morning.

59:04.541 --> 59:05.750
Move along.

59:05.833 --> 59:08.125
Get the fuck out of our house!

59:08.208 --> 59:09.791
What happened to your wife's face, John?

59:09.875 --> 59:10.791
That is just... no way...

59:10.875 --> 59:12.166
What? Did you hit her with that...

59:12.250 --> 59:13.708
You're a filthy cop.

59:13.791 --> 59:16.541
You're a fuckin' disgrace.
You beat that...

59:16.625 --> 59:18.333
- Fuckin' hell!

59:18.416 --> 59:19.666
Shit.

59:23.000 --> 59:24.666
Get off of him!

59:24.750 --> 59:26.708
Get off of him, you son of a bitch.

59:27.791 --> 59:30.750
Spense! Stop!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

59:34.333 --> 59:35.583
Get off of him!

59:35.666 --> 59:37.083
Get off of him!

59:44.750 --> 59:46.750
That fucker over there killed a cat?

59:49.750 --> 59:52.916
So, the cat is what you're
takin' away from all of this?

59:54.000 --> 59:55.375
Here's what we're gonna do.

59:55.458 --> 59:57.541
We're gonna blow this whole shit open.

59:57.625 --> 59:59.666
Clear Terrence's name,
take these guys down.

59:59.750 --> 1:00:01.833

Hey, you guys.

1:03:22.791 --> 1:03:24.500
You looking
for something, Officer?

1:03:24.583 --> 1:03:27.916
No, former officer.
I'm just a concerned citizen now.

1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.750
Doing a little private investigating?

1:03:29.833 --> 1:03:32.666
I haven't really come up
with the title yet for what I'm doing.

1:03:33.791 --> 1:03:36.333
Let me know if you hear anything
germane to my investigation.

1:03:36.416 --> 1:03:39.041
What investigation is that,
uh, Agent Louisa Burton?

1:03:39.125 --> 1:03:40.208
Use your imagination.

1:03:40.833 --> 1:03:43.625
You're the guy that got arrested
for assaulting John Boylan.

1:03:43.708 --> 1:03:44.833
That's who you are.

1:03:44.916 --> 1:03:46.125
Gosh, damn it, that's who he is.

1:03:48.250 --> 1:03:50.833
Wow. Your partner's wound
a little tight, huh?

1:03:51.541 --> 1:03:55.041
You know, no offense, but two
top-dollar Feds tailing a dirty cop?

1:03:55.125 --> 1:03:59.166
I mean, what did you two do
to fuckin' deserve this shit detail?

1:03:59.750 --> 1:04:01.125
See you later, all right?

1:04:11.541 --> 1:04:14.250
<i>It's simple. The FBI</i>
<i>does not solve crime, they manage them.</i>

1:04:14.333 --> 1:04:16.250
<i>They play some big abstract game,</i>

1:04:16.333 --> 1:04:18.666
<i>trying to trade-up</i>
<i>for some vague masterplan,</i>

1:04:18.750 --> 1:04:20.041
<i>a big fish, which they never do.</i>

1:04:20.125 --> 1:04:22.083
<i>Meanwhile, all the victims, the innocents,</i>

1:04:22.166 --> 1:04:23.875
-the Terrence Grahams of the world...
- Hmm.

1:04:23.958 --> 1:04:25.250
...they fall through the cracks. Right?

1:04:25.333 --> 1:04:26.458
There's zero justice, ever.

1:04:26.541 --> 1:04:27.875
So, where are we?

1:04:27.958 --> 1:04:30.625
We got Trinitarios, deal makin' FBI.

1:04:31.666 --> 1:04:32.541
Yeah.

1:04:32.625 --> 1:04:35.000
And we got some
very corrupt cops covering something up.

1:04:36.208 --> 1:04:38.833
-Well, maybe killing Boylan was a message.

1:04:43.291 --> 1:04:44.916
I know who we gotta go see.

1:05:06.666 --> 1:05:08.166
What the fuck do you want?

1:05:08.750 --> 1:05:10.333
You know that hit you tried on me?

1:05:11.583 --> 1:05:13.416
Who wanted that?

1:05:13.500 --> 1:05:15.833
Why is the FBI tailing dirty cops?

1:05:15.916 --> 1:05:17.416
What's going on in the city?

1:05:18.458 --> 1:05:20.250
I don't have anything to say to you.

1:05:21.083 --> 1:05:23.583
I figured you'd say that.

1:05:24.083 --> 1:05:25.125
Do you like movies, Squeeb?

1:05:26.500 --> 1:05:29.458
I got friends in here.
I was able to bring in my phone.

1:05:30.291 --> 1:05:31.291
Henry, we're live.

1:05:31.375 --> 1:05:33.791
<i>I... Let me...</i>
<i>I don't know if I have this right.</i>

1:05:34.375 --> 1:05:35.291
The fuck is that?

1:05:35.375 --> 1:05:38.291
- <i>For Christ's sake. I got it--</i>
-Move your face away from the camera.

1:05:38.375 --> 1:05:39.375
-Yeah. Henry.
<i>-What?</i>

1:05:39.458 --> 1:05:42.083
Move your face away from the camera.

1:05:43.208 --> 1:05:45.416
<i>-You got video?</i>
-Yes.

1:05:45.500 --> 1:05:46.791
<i>Are we really doing this?</i>

1:05:46.875 --> 1:05:48.583
Yes. Now.

1:05:53.541 --> 1:05:54.708
Recognize her?

1:05:57.916 --> 1:05:59.250
Hey, is that my wife?

1:05:59.333 --> 1:06:00.708
It ain't mine.

1:06:00.791 --> 1:06:01.875
Hey, what the fuck?

1:06:01.958 --> 1:06:04.250
How long has it been, huh?
How long you been in here?

1:06:04.750 --> 1:06:06.833
How long has it been
since she's had some real attention?

1:06:09.041 --> 1:06:10.458
You see that handsome gentleman there?

1:06:11.041 --> 1:06:12.666
He met her in a supermarket.

1:06:12.750 --> 1:06:14.833
He asked her if she wanted
to have a drink, she said yes.

1:06:14.916 --> 1:06:16.000
-Look how she's dressed.
-Fuck you!

1:06:16.083 --> 1:06:17.625
No, look how she's dressed up.

1:06:17.708 --> 1:06:21.333
Three in the afternoon,
she's dressed up like that? Wow.

1:06:21.416 --> 1:06:23.416
And you know what she had to do?
She had to get a babysitter.

1:06:23.500 --> 1:06:25.291
That's a weird time
to get a babysitter, huh?

1:06:25.375 --> 1:06:27.291
What are all the Aryan brothers
gonna say about that?

1:06:31.083 --> 1:06:33.916
You better hurry up, Squeeb.
She's already had four drinks.

1:06:34.000 --> 1:06:36.166
Fuck you. What the fuck do you want?

1:06:37.291 --> 1:06:38.916
I want answers, okay?

1:06:42.458 --> 1:06:44.375
Tell your friend to leave Suzie alone.

1:06:47.583 --> 1:06:50.208
Henry, tell Hawk to walk away.

1:06:50.291 --> 1:06:53.166
<i>Okay, got it.</i>
<i>Hey, Romeo, get outta there.</i>

1:06:57.625 --> 1:06:58.791
What do you want?

1:06:59.625 --> 1:07:02.625
I know you know things, Squeeb.
You got ears on the street.

1:07:03.708 --> 1:07:06.833
What happened to Boylan? Hmm?

1:07:07.833 --> 1:07:10.041
Who ordered the hit on me on my last day?

1:07:13.333 --> 1:07:15.500
I'll give you one word, man,
one word only.

1:07:15.583 --> 1:07:17.833
Well, it better be a good word, <i>amigo.</i>

1:07:24.041 --> 1:07:25.041
Wonderland.

1:07:29.125 --> 1:07:30.875
What, you mean the dog track?

1:07:34.416 --> 1:07:35.708
What are you smiling at, Squeeb?

1:07:36.291 --> 1:07:39.208
I just keep imagining your head
rolling down the sidewalk.

1:07:39.958 --> 1:07:42.208
You're fuckin' dead.

1:07:48.833 --> 1:07:50.625
Cosgrove, you in there?

1:07:50.708 --> 1:07:51.958
Who's there?

1:07:52.583 --> 1:07:53.625
Come on out.

1:07:54.625 --> 1:07:55.500
Where are you?

1:07:56.291 --> 1:07:57.625
Wonderland.

1:07:57.708 --> 1:07:59.458
They're building a casino there.

1:07:59.541 --> 1:08:02.166
It's gonna have the GNP
of a small oil-rich nation.

1:08:02.250 --> 1:08:04.500
- <i>And it's corrupt?</i>
- <i>Well, yeah.</i>

1:08:04.583 --> 1:08:06.666
<i>I mean, ever heard of</i>
<i>an honest outfit running a casino?</i>

1:08:06.750 --> 1:08:09.833
<i>I mean, they are, by design,</i>
<i>instruments of corruption.</i>

1:08:10.916 --> 1:08:14.833
If I was still a crime reporter
and I wanted to get my head chopped off,

1:08:14.916 --> 1:08:17.791
<i>I'd be writing about</i>
<i>the connection between some dirty cops</i>

1:08:17.875 --> 1:08:20.458
<i>and some big politicians</i>
<i>using the Trinitario drug trade</i>

1:08:20.541 --> 1:08:22.750
<i>to get a seat at the table of Wonderland.</i>

1:08:22.833 --> 1:08:26.083
It's like some fuckin' evil partnership.

1:08:26.166 --> 1:08:27.083
It's got a name.

1:08:27.166 --> 1:08:30.708
Los Oscuros. Huh? The Dark.

1:08:30.791 --> 1:08:32.125
Cosgrove, if you know all this,

1:08:32.208 --> 1:08:33.958
why don't you just go public
with what you have?

1:08:35.583 --> 1:08:38.250
Because the Wonderland syndicate
has got enough money

1:08:38.333 --> 1:08:40.250
<i>to bury anything I put out there.</i>

1:08:42.166 --> 1:08:43.625
<i>All right, picture this.</i>

1:08:43.708 --> 1:08:46.833
<i>Real bad cops, Dominican street gangs,</i>

1:08:47.458 --> 1:08:49.375
<i>and some of the dirtiest</i>
<i>investors in the game,</i>

1:08:49.458 --> 1:08:51.208
<i>all working together</i>

1:08:51.291 --> 1:08:54.041
<i>to build the next</i>
<i>great family-friendly resort destination</i>

1:08:54.125 --> 1:08:55.625
<i>for degenerate gamblers.</i>

1:09:00.500 --> 1:09:02.500
<i>What if I get you evidence?</i>

1:09:02.583 --> 1:09:06.500
What? Real, undeniable evidence?

1:09:06.583 --> 1:09:08.541
I don't even know what that looks like.

1:09:08.625 --> 1:09:12.625
It would have to be some fuckin' visual
to poke through this fake news bullshit.

1:09:12.708 --> 1:09:16.458
I'll tell you that. Okay? So, we done now?

1:09:17.250 --> 1:09:18.875
Because, honestly,
this is the kind of conversation

1:09:18.958 --> 1:09:21.000
where a little red sniper dot
pops up on my forehead.

1:09:21.083 --> 1:09:22.083
Hey, yo!

1:09:28.958 --> 1:09:30.458
- What's up?
-Hey, you can't be here.

1:09:30.541 --> 1:09:32.916
No? I'm sorry,
is this private property?

1:09:34.125 --> 1:09:36.041
Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see a sign.

1:09:36.125 --> 1:09:38.250
I used to come here
as a kid all the time with my grandfather.

1:09:38.333 --> 1:09:40.458
I thought it was reopening.
I was hoping to see some dog races.

1:09:40.541 --> 1:09:42.666
Nah, no dogs in Massachusetts
for 20 years.

1:09:43.208 --> 1:09:44.375
Oh, no, that's simply not true.

1:09:44.458 --> 1:09:46.250
I see dogs all the time in Massachusetts.

1:09:46.333 --> 1:09:48.083
In fact, I have one.

1:09:48.583 --> 1:09:50.416
Look at that. Her name's Pearl, huh?

1:09:50.500 --> 1:09:52.416
What a queen.
I named her after my grandma.

1:09:52.500 --> 1:09:55.083
-Now you gotta get outta here.
-Okay.

1:09:55.166 --> 1:09:56.958
-Come on.
-All right. I'm sorry about that.

1:09:57.458 --> 1:09:58.708
Have a good one, guys.

1:10:10.125 --> 1:10:12.458
♪ <i>Lord ♪</i>

1:10:12.541 --> 1:10:16.250
<i>♪ Please give strength</i>
<i>To our sister Letitia ♪</i>

1:10:21.208 --> 1:10:23.750
- Present arms! Weapons up.

1:10:25.166 --> 1:10:28.333
<i>Ready, aim, fire!</i>

1:10:30.708 --> 1:10:31.833
Fire!

1:10:37.375 --> 1:10:40.750
We have come way too far
to let this take up any more of our time.

1:10:40.833 --> 1:10:41.833
Fire!

1:10:42.916 --> 1:10:44.083
Cat and the bell.

1:10:45.541 --> 1:10:48.583
Group of mice live very happily in a barn

1:10:48.666 --> 1:10:52.708
until, one day, a feral cat
starts eating the mice.

1:10:53.416 --> 1:10:54.958
<i>So, they all gather together one night</i>

1:10:55.041 --> 1:10:58.250
<i>to figure out what to do</i>
<i>about this feral cat.</i>

1:10:59.833 --> 1:11:01.083
So, one of the younger mice speaks up.

1:11:01.166 --> 1:11:02.333
- Fire!

1:11:02.416 --> 1:11:04.083
<i>"Why don't we place</i>
<i>a bell around his neck</i>

1:11:04.166 --> 1:11:06.125
<i>so that every time he's coming,</i>
<i>we can hear him?"</i>

1:11:06.708 --> 1:11:10.125
One of the older mice says,
"That is an excellent idea,

1:11:11.250 --> 1:11:15.416
but whom shall we get to place
the bell around the cat's neck?"

1:11:15.500 --> 1:11:16.750
Fire!

1:11:17.458 --> 1:11:18.666
So, what do we do, then?

1:11:20.583 --> 1:11:22.708
Sometimes you gotta just kill the cat.

1:12:01.458 --> 1:12:03.791
- I heard you just got out.
-Oh, man.

1:12:03.875 --> 1:12:06.416
Oh, I bet you could use
a good meal.

1:12:06.500 --> 1:12:09.125
Missed you, buddy.
Yeah, I need, uh, four burrito.

1:12:09.208 --> 1:12:10.208
Four burrito.

1:12:10.291 --> 1:12:12.250
-Uh, carne asada.
-Oh, you like that.

1:12:12.333 --> 1:12:15.541
And, uh, <i>pollo,</i> uh, <i>puerco.</i>
And you know what? Chorizo.

1:12:15.625 --> 1:12:17.625
Chorizo. You got it.

1:12:17.708 --> 1:12:18.916
<i>Puerco.</i> And you know what?

1:12:20.083 --> 1:12:22.375

<i>Burning up my tension ♪</i>

1:12:26.583 --> 1:12:29.625
-How's <i>mijo?</i>
-Oh, <i>mijo</i> is fine.

1:12:29.708 --> 1:12:32.583
I wasn't gonna ask you.
I haven't seen you in a while.

1:12:34.375 --> 1:12:36.208
- Yeah. Wife is good?
- Yeah. <i>Muy bien.</i>

1:12:36.291 --> 1:12:38.958
-What about, uh, quesadilla?

1:12:39.541 --> 1:12:43.000
Oh. If you want quesadilla,
just gotta wait on the tortilla.

1:12:45.708 --> 1:12:48.250
Quesadilla's...

1:12:49.708 --> 1:12:53.791
Oh, my wife Julia,
oh, she's so great.

1:12:53.875 --> 1:12:56.250
Yeah. She's great.

1:13:37.708 --> 1:13:39.125
No!

1:13:41.333 --> 1:13:42.166
Fuck!

1:13:50.458 --> 1:13:52.333
Yo! Get in!

1:13:58.208 --> 1:13:59.625
Oh, shit!

1:14:01.291 --> 1:14:02.791
-You're in big trouble.
-For what?

1:14:02.875 --> 1:14:04.958
You smashed the Riviera
through a restaurant!

1:14:05.041 --> 1:14:05.875
Get in the car!

1:14:05.958 --> 1:14:07.125
I'm tellin' Henry
you were driving the car.

1:14:16.166 --> 1:14:18.000
Man, you get beat up a lot.

1:14:18.083 --> 1:14:21.083
And I've noticed every single time
you get your face pushed in,

1:14:21.166 --> 1:14:23.375
you come back with just
a little bit more information.

1:14:23.458 --> 1:14:25.875
-Would you stop?
-I'm just saying.

1:14:25.958 --> 1:14:27.583
I don't think it's a very good tactic.

1:14:27.666 --> 1:14:28.708
They know who I am now.

1:14:28.791 --> 1:14:30.166
-No shit!
-They're gonna know where to find me.

1:14:30.250 --> 1:14:31.916
They're gonna
come looking for me at Henry's.

1:14:32.000 --> 1:14:33.708
They'll find Henry at Henry's.

1:14:34.791 --> 1:14:35.625
Shit!

1:14:42.708 --> 1:14:44.500
I hope you brought towels.
This isn't a Motel Six.

1:14:44.583 --> 1:14:46.458
Hey. We're here two days, four days max.

1:14:46.541 --> 1:14:49.666
It's not safe at Henry's.
Nobody's gonna look for us here.

1:14:50.250 --> 1:14:51.375
Who won't look for you here?

1:14:51.458 --> 1:14:53.708
Law enforcement. Trinitarios.

1:14:53.791 --> 1:14:55.583
Oh, the good guys and the bad guys.

1:14:55.666 --> 1:14:57.166
That makes me feel much better.

1:14:57.250 --> 1:14:59.125
It's also repetitive behavior.

1:15:00.125 --> 1:15:02.041
Hi.
Spenser.

1:15:02.125 --> 1:15:05.000
- Is this your house or a kennel?

1:15:05.083 --> 1:15:08.541
Both. I clean dogs,
I board dogs and I am--

1:15:08.625 --> 1:15:09.583
Come here.

1:15:09.666 --> 1:15:11.791
And I am very successful at it, all right?

1:15:11.875 --> 1:15:13.208
What did you expect? Punching bags?

1:15:13.291 --> 1:15:15.416
A bunch of grown men kicking
each other in the fuckin' neck?

1:15:15.500 --> 1:15:16.625
-Go to Henry's for that.
- Hey.

1:15:16.708 --> 1:15:19.333
-Leave my business out of it.
-I expected more from you.

1:15:19.416 --> 1:15:21.541
You're supposed to be his mentor.

1:15:21.625 --> 1:15:24.000
Create an atmosphere of
responsible thought and action.

1:15:24.083 --> 1:15:26.750
Instead, you got two grown men
runnin' around playing Batman.

1:15:26.833 --> 1:15:28.458
We're not playing Batman, okay?

1:15:28.541 --> 1:15:30.666
This is Batman business all the way.

1:15:30.750 --> 1:15:33.833
Got you and big boy over here
running through Boston all Robin-ed up.

1:15:33.916 --> 1:15:35.458
I am not Robin.

1:15:35.541 --> 1:15:37.125
And Alfred over here...

1:15:37.208 --> 1:15:38.958
Uh... Oh, Jesus.

1:15:39.041 --> 1:15:41.125
You are an enabling Alfred.

1:15:41.208 --> 1:15:43.333
You gave him the keys to the Batmobile.

1:15:43.416 --> 1:15:45.500
The Riv is not the Batmobile.

1:15:45.583 --> 1:15:47.291
Well, it serves the same purpose.

1:15:47.375 --> 1:15:49.083
Are we really gonna stay here?

1:15:49.166 --> 1:15:52.250
Because I'd rather take my chances
with the Trinitarios.

1:15:52.333 --> 1:15:53.625
At least they don't talk so much.

1:15:53.708 --> 1:15:56.583
No. Because they're too busy
trying to shoot you.

1:15:56.666 --> 1:15:58.833
You know, actually, they prefer machetes.

1:15:58.916 --> 1:16:00.916
Well, they're angry.

1:16:01.000 --> 1:16:04.291
Okay, well, I feel so much better now.

1:16:04.375 --> 1:16:05.500
So, I'm just gonna go.

1:16:05.583 --> 1:16:06.583
Let's go, boys.

1:16:06.666 --> 1:16:08.875
Snowball, Rosco, Smokey. Let's go.

1:16:19.375 --> 1:16:20.458
You hungry?

1:16:38.291 --> 1:16:39.458
Spenser?

1:16:52.916 --> 1:16:53.875
Did you call the police?

1:16:54.583 --> 1:16:55.750
No.

1:16:55.833 --> 1:16:58.708
And why would I? They probably did this.

1:17:15.625 --> 1:17:16.500
Hey.

1:17:18.125 --> 1:17:19.458
Are you a giant?

1:17:20.708 --> 1:17:21.750
Yeah.

1:17:21.833 --> 1:17:24.125
Are you a good one or a bad one?

1:17:24.208 --> 1:17:25.500
I'm a good one.

1:17:25.583 --> 1:17:27.958
Can you pull my bed over?

1:17:28.625 --> 1:17:30.291
I think I could handle that.

1:17:47.166 --> 1:17:49.250
I want you to put the pillow on the bed.

1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:51.125
Can you do that?

1:17:57.666 --> 1:17:58.916
Both pillows.

1:18:02.833 --> 1:18:05.541
Where would Terrence keep something
if he didn't want anybody to find it?

1:18:06.750 --> 1:18:07.625
I don't know.

1:18:08.416 --> 1:18:10.333
Well, do you have any idea
what they were looking for?

1:18:14.250 --> 1:18:15.083
What?

1:18:15.958 --> 1:18:17.750
Do you know what they were looking for?

1:18:18.333 --> 1:18:19.416
No, I don't.

1:18:26.083 --> 1:18:27.333
Why are you doing this?

1:18:28.958 --> 1:18:30.666
'Cause it's the right thing to do.

1:18:47.458 --> 1:18:48.791
Terrence...

1:18:50.291 --> 1:18:53.583
mailed this to me the day he died.

1:18:58.833 --> 1:19:00.041
It's a wire.

1:19:00.125 --> 1:19:01.375
I know what it is.

1:19:02.041 --> 1:19:03.375
Did you listen to it?

1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:04.916
I don't know how.

1:19:06.041 --> 1:19:07.000
I do.

1:19:28.416 --> 1:19:30.750
-You have some place you can stay?
-No.

1:19:31.916 --> 1:19:33.458
We're not goin' anywhere.

1:19:34.375 --> 1:19:36.333
I'm not getting chased out of my own home.

1:19:36.416 --> 1:19:37.708
Well, good for you.

1:19:39.125 --> 1:19:40.083
All right, look.

1:19:40.833 --> 1:19:42.791
I'm gonna call you
when I know something, okay?

1:19:44.291 --> 1:19:45.875
-Thank you.
- Okay.

1:19:46.750 --> 1:19:48.541
Can I hold on to this?

1:19:49.958 --> 1:19:51.833
It's got his handwriting on it.

1:19:51.916 --> 1:19:53.041
Of course.

1:19:54.041 --> 1:19:56.791
All right. I'll call you soon. Come on.

1:19:58.375 --> 1:19:59.666
<i>Come on, Boylan.</i>

1:19:59.750 --> 1:20:02.666
<i>We both want to get home</i>
<i>to our families. Help me out.</i>

1:20:02.750 --> 1:20:06.166
<i> You got no fuckin' idea</i>
<i>how deep this shit goes.</i>

1:20:06.250 --> 1:20:07.916
<i>So, tell me.</i>

1:20:08.000 --> 1:20:11.291
<i>Now, that information</i>
<i>is way above my pay grade, Mr. Altar Boy.</i>

1:20:11.375 --> 1:20:12.250
<i>But high up.</i>

1:20:13.291 --> 1:20:15.041
<i>High up.</i>

1:20:15.125 --> 1:20:18.250
All right, Los Oscuros is just
one seat at this fuckin' table.

1:20:18.333 --> 1:20:19.375
Oh, come on.

1:20:20.083 --> 1:20:21.333
The Feds.

1:20:21.916 --> 1:20:23.875
Give me something good
to whet their appetite.

1:20:23.958 --> 1:20:25.833
What are you guys using
the Trinitario drug money for?

1:20:25.916 --> 1:20:27.166
What do you think?

1:20:28.083 --> 1:20:29.708
It's our ticket into Wonderland.

1:20:30.208 --> 1:20:33.916
Permits, pay-offs, construction.
All that. Dirty cops.

1:20:34.000 --> 1:20:36.583
-Like you?
-Yeah, like me.

1:20:37.958 --> 1:20:40.125
Who's running this thing?
How does it work?

1:20:40.208 --> 1:20:42.125
Trinitarios are working for Bentwood.

1:20:43.250 --> 1:20:47.958
<i>Bentwood works for Macklin.</i>
<i>And they all work for Driscoll.</i>

1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:50.291
They already know this.

1:20:51.041 --> 1:20:52.750
I need something concrete, Boylan.

1:20:52.833 --> 1:20:54.583
Come on, man. I'm on your side.

1:20:56.666 --> 1:20:58.833
Let me help you get
the best deal out of this.

1:20:58.916 --> 1:21:00.750
<i>Tell me about the Pony Express.</i>

1:21:01.291 --> 1:21:02.750
<i>I'll make it clear.</i>

1:21:02.833 --> 1:21:07.458
<i>Trinitario street gang and Tracksuit</i>
<i>Charlie do the Pony Express once a week.</i>

1:21:07.541 --> 1:21:10.958
<i>You tell your fuckin' Feds</i>
<i>to picture the biggest shipment</i>

1:21:11.041 --> 1:21:14.625
of fentanyl and oxy that they can imagine.

1:21:15.208 --> 1:21:18.541
All right? And when they get that picture,
tell 'em to triple it.

1:21:19.125 --> 1:21:20.208
Where and when?

1:21:23.375 --> 1:21:25.958
I will tell you that once I get my deal.

1:21:29.375 --> 1:21:31.833
<i>Trinitarios are working for Bentwood.</i>

1:21:31.916 --> 1:21:33.333
I swear to God, I didn't give anything!

1:21:33.416 --> 1:21:34.541
You're a rat, Boylan.

1:21:34.625 --> 1:21:36.291
<i>Bentwood works for Macklin.</i>

1:21:38.583 --> 1:21:40.875
<i>And they all work for Driscoll.</i>

1:21:40.958 --> 1:21:43.583
I didn't give them anything, I swear!

1:21:44.083 --> 1:21:46.208
This is my favorite part, you fuckin' rat.

1:21:47.083 --> 1:21:50.500
I see you got kara... Excuse me,
karate, after school today, right?

1:21:50.583 --> 1:21:51.416
Yes, sir.

1:21:51.500 --> 1:21:53.166
You gonna be able to get
yourself home from there?

1:21:53.250 --> 1:21:54.125
Yes.

1:21:54.833 --> 1:21:56.833
- I need you home by 5:00.
-Yes, sir.

1:21:56.916 --> 1:21:58.041
- No later.
-Yes.

1:21:58.125 --> 1:21:59.916
-5:00 p.m. What time you comin' home?
-5:00.

1:22:00.000 --> 1:22:02.458
Please don't be late.
Your mother's killing me about this, so...

1:22:08.708 --> 1:22:09.791
Stay right here.

1:22:18.458 --> 1:22:20.500
-Spenser.
- Hey.

1:22:20.583 --> 1:22:21.875
What are you, lost?

1:22:22.666 --> 1:22:24.333
Nah. Just happened
to be in the neighborhood.

1:22:26.208 --> 1:22:27.875
Okay. Okay.

1:22:31.708 --> 1:22:34.666
The fuck
you doin' here, Spenser?

1:22:38.500 --> 1:22:40.208
I know about Wonderland, brother.

1:22:41.625 --> 1:22:42.958
I know you're in deep.

1:22:50.333 --> 1:22:51.708
You got any proof, Spenser?

1:22:54.333 --> 1:22:56.458
Yeah. Too much.

1:23:00.500 --> 1:23:04.208
You know, the good cop
that I know, if he's still in--

1:23:08.333 --> 1:23:09.916
-All right.

1:23:10.541 --> 1:23:12.250
Tell you what,
I'm gonna give you

1:23:12.333 --> 1:23:15.000
one last chance
to come clean about Wonderland.

1:23:16.500 --> 1:23:19.791
Cut a deal with the Feds, tell them
the truth before more people get hurt.

1:23:20.375 --> 1:23:23.375
You do your time like a man, brother.

1:23:23.916 --> 1:23:24.875
Like I did.

1:23:28.708 --> 1:23:29.708
Be a hero for Josh.

1:23:38.708 --> 1:23:40.583
Get the fuck outta here.

1:23:44.875 --> 1:23:46.375
That's what I figured.

1:23:48.041 --> 1:23:51.000
You always were a hard-head. Just like me.

1:23:51.916 --> 1:23:54.166
-Bye, roommate.

1:24:06.666 --> 1:24:08.458

What are we gonna do?
We're gonna get this done?

1:24:17.375 --> 1:24:20.250
Agent Burton, just use the tape
to clear Terrence Graham's name.

1:24:20.333 --> 1:24:22.333
This tape? It's not enough.

1:24:22.416 --> 1:24:24.625
What are you talking about?
Even without the tape.

1:24:24.708 --> 1:24:26.416
The drugs are enough physical evidence

1:24:26.500 --> 1:24:28.083
for a RICO case against
the whole Wonderland crew!

1:24:28.166 --> 1:24:29.791

Oh, my God. Now that's bullshit.

You wanna help that cop's family?

1:24:40.000 --> 1:24:42.333
Walk away. We've got bigger fish to fry.

1:25:15.583 --> 1:25:17.375
No, no, no! Okay, Spense.

1:25:25.333 --> 1:25:27.708
I wanna know everything.
Who's drivin'?

1:25:27.791 --> 1:25:30.625
What they're drivin'?
Where they're comin' from? When and where?

1:25:30.708 --> 1:25:32.458
You're going to tell me everything!

1:25:34.333 --> 1:25:36.291
Hey, man! They will cut your head off--

1:25:36.375 --> 1:25:38.166
- Oh, really?

1:25:38.250 --> 1:25:39.958
What are they driving, Charlie?

1:25:44.375 --> 1:25:47.208
Refrigeration van.
Coming from New Hampshire.

1:25:47.291 --> 1:25:49.541
Okay. It's coming down the pipes.

1:25:49.625 --> 1:25:51.333
It's hid in the refrigeration tanks.

1:25:51.416 --> 1:25:52.833
- <i>When?</i>
<i>-Tomorrow.</i>

1:25:52.916 --> 1:25:54.208

-<i> Today! Noon.</i>

1:25:54.291 --> 1:25:56.416
- <i>Which one?</i>

1:25:56.500 --> 1:25:58.458
<i>-What day do you meet, Charlie?</i>
- <i>Today!</i>

1:26:29.041 --> 1:26:30.458
Excuse me, sir. Are you okay?

1:26:31.041 --> 1:26:33.666
Oh, my God. You've got blood
all over you. Let me see?

1:26:38.000 --> 1:26:39.125
No.

1:26:47.250 --> 1:26:48.250
Oh, shit.

1:26:50.916 --> 1:26:52.583
-You forgot one in the back.
-I forgot one in the back?

1:26:52.666 --> 1:26:54.416
It's the driver's responsibility
to check the back.

1:26:54.500 --> 1:26:56.250
Who makes these rules?

1:26:56.333 --> 1:26:57.833
Hey. Hey! Hey!

1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:04.375
You motherfuckers is dead.

1:27:04.458 --> 1:27:05.833
Shit! Fuck.

1:27:05.916 --> 1:27:07.208
You... You dead.

1:27:08.291 --> 1:27:09.291
Yous is dead.

1:27:12.291 --> 1:27:13.291
Oh, shit.

1:27:18.291 --> 1:27:20.666
Every single one of them is full. Huh?

1:27:21.583 --> 1:27:24.041
This is how the cops are buying
their way into Wonderland.

1:27:24.125 --> 1:27:26.833
Jesus Christ! I haven't
done drugs in 20 years.

1:27:26.916 --> 1:27:28.333
I don't even know
what I'm lookin' at here.

1:27:28.416 --> 1:27:31.041
Fentanyl, oxy, coke.

1:27:31.125 --> 1:27:32.416
It's half the drugs in New England.

1:27:33.333 --> 1:27:34.791
Isn't this just gonna piss 'em off?

1:27:34.875 --> 1:27:38.000
Yeah, it's gonna piss 'em off once
they end up in federal prison, absolutely.

1:27:39.041 --> 1:27:40.083
Uh, I don't know if it's enough.

1:27:40.166 --> 1:27:41.833
You don't know if it's enough?

1:27:41.916 --> 1:27:43.250
What is wrong with you?

1:27:43.333 --> 1:27:45.000
It's just
a truck full of drugs!

1:27:45.083 --> 1:27:46.708
If I gave you a photograph
of them smiling and holding it,

1:27:46.791 --> 1:27:48.500
-you'd say it wasn't authenticated.
-No, that'd be good.

1:27:48.583 --> 1:27:49.750
-Yeah.
-Them holding it? Huh?

1:27:49.833 --> 1:27:52.083
If I gave you a video tape,
you'd say it was doctored.

1:27:52.166 --> 1:27:54.083
If I walked them into court
with the drugs in their hands,

1:27:54.166 --> 1:27:55.333
you'll say they were coerced.

1:27:55.416 --> 1:27:56.541
You're unbelievable.

1:28:04.125 --> 1:28:05.916
-Calm down.

1:28:06.500 --> 1:28:07.500
Sit!

1:28:08.041 --> 1:28:09.333
-Shit!
-This is not good.

1:28:09.416 --> 1:28:10.541
That dude ID'd us.

1:28:12.333 --> 1:28:13.916
- Jesus Christ.
-Jesus Christ, man...

1:28:14.541 --> 1:28:17.166
Ringo, what's wrong? What's wrong, baby?

1:28:17.250 --> 1:28:19.500
What is it, baby? What's up, baby?

1:28:20.166 --> 1:28:21.666
-What is it, Ringo?

1:28:21.750 --> 1:28:22.791
Whose van is that?

1:28:22.875 --> 1:28:24.875
That's... It's Hawk's. He got a job.

1:28:24.958 --> 1:28:26.041
-Yeah.
-I'm just helping him.

1:28:26.125 --> 1:28:28.291
-It's just like a side hustle thing.
- Uh-huh.

1:28:28.375 --> 1:28:31.041
You know what Ringo here's job was
before he retired?

1:28:31.125 --> 1:28:32.875
-Do you know what his main hustle was?
- What?

1:28:32.958 --> 1:28:34.333
He was a narcotics dog.

1:28:34.416 --> 1:28:36.291
-Bingo! Ringo.

1:28:37.166 --> 1:28:39.125
-Don't let that thing in here!
-Oi! Oi!

1:28:41.625 --> 1:28:42.916
Go back inside.
I need you guys--

1:28:43.000 --> 1:28:43.916
What the fuck is that?

1:28:44.000 --> 1:28:45.916
You brought drugs into my garage?

1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:48.083
Just do me a favor.
Go back in the house with Henry.

1:28:50.666 --> 1:28:52.041
What did you do?

1:28:53.416 --> 1:28:54.500
Henry?

1:28:54.583 --> 1:28:55.458
Spenser!

1:28:55.541 --> 1:28:56.500
I told everybody
to stay in the house.

1:28:56.583 --> 1:28:58.125
-Spenser!
-Where's Henry?

1:28:58.208 --> 1:29:00.500
-He's not here.
-Why is he not here?

1:29:00.583 --> 1:29:02.291
He... he wanted to go home.

1:29:02.375 --> 1:29:04.791
-He said he wanted to go.
-I specifically told you to stay here!

1:29:04.875 --> 1:29:05.750
Why would you let him leave?

1:29:05.833 --> 1:29:08.166
What am I supposed to do?
Chain him to the radiator?

1:29:08.250 --> 1:29:10.083
-Where is he gonna go?
- He wanted to go home!

1:29:10.166 --> 1:29:11.541
Oh, my God. You gotta be kidding--

1:29:14.125 --> 1:29:15.625
Shit, he's FaceTiming me.

1:29:15.708 --> 1:29:17.750
Henry doesn't know how to FaceTime.

1:29:20.708 --> 1:29:21.666
<i>Spenser.</i>

1:29:27.625 --> 1:29:28.666
What do you want?

1:29:29.166 --> 1:29:32.375
I want us to sit down and talk
and throw everything on the table.

1:29:33.125 --> 1:29:34.541
<i>Work this out before...</i>

1:29:35.500 --> 1:29:37.125
I have to kill Henry here.

1:29:37.208 --> 1:29:38.833
Hey. Don't touch him.

1:29:39.458 --> 1:29:42.041
You hear me? Do not touch him.

1:29:42.125 --> 1:29:44.250
These guys are a bunch of idiots, Spenser.

1:29:44.333 --> 1:29:45.666
-Spenser...
-<i> Put Driscoll back on.</i>

1:29:45.750 --> 1:29:47.708
Fuck 'em. Hang up.
He hit me in the eye.

1:29:48.291 --> 1:29:49.958
Where are ya? I'll come there right now.

1:29:50.541 --> 1:29:53.000
Wonderland. One hour.

1:29:53.083 --> 1:29:54.333
I'm on my way.

1:29:55.791 --> 1:29:57.583
And bring my drug shipment.

1:30:03.541 --> 1:30:04.875
What are we gonna do?

1:30:11.375 --> 1:30:12.791
You're with me?

1:30:19.583 --> 1:30:20.458
Okay.

1:30:21.541 --> 1:30:22.708
-Look.
- Mmm.

1:30:22.791 --> 1:30:25.791
Wonderland is basically
like an abandoned fortress.

1:30:25.875 --> 1:30:28.541
And there's pretty much
only one way in, right here.

1:30:28.625 --> 1:30:30.541
It's the middle of the day.
There's not a lot of places to hide.

1:30:30.625 --> 1:30:32.375
We're gonna have to get
Henry out of the way.

1:30:32.458 --> 1:30:34.000
And I got a plan.

1:30:34.083 --> 1:30:36.625
It's a little unconventional.
You're gonna have to trust me.

1:30:38.833 --> 1:30:41.083
No, no, no.
No, you don't get the cool gun.

1:30:41.166 --> 1:30:43.958
Aw. Hawk is the name of
a motherfucker with a shotgun.

1:30:44.041 --> 1:30:45.291
Spenser does your taxes.

1:30:46.625 --> 1:30:48.208
That was good. I'll give you that one.

1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:49.833
All right.

1:31:00.041 --> 1:31:01.833
You know,
I'd really love to understand

1:31:01.916 --> 1:31:03.875
the process of why you took me
as a hostage.

1:31:03.958 --> 1:31:05.291
Nobody's gonna come for me.

1:31:05.875 --> 1:31:07.625
I got about three minutes left in me.

1:31:07.708 --> 1:31:09.291
Nobody gives a shit if I live or die.

1:31:09.375 --> 1:31:11.333
I don't even care much if I live or die.

1:31:11.416 --> 1:31:14.500
You hit me in the eye.
What you hit me in the eye for?

1:31:14.583 --> 1:31:16.291
I was sitting, minding my own business.

1:31:16.375 --> 1:31:19.458
You come in, I say, "Hello,"
and you hit me in the eye.

1:31:35.250 --> 1:31:36.500
-I gotta go to the bathroom.
-Henry.

1:31:37.083 --> 1:31:38.125
-What?
- Henry.

1:31:38.708 --> 1:31:40.375
I will gag you, old-timer.

1:31:40.958 --> 1:31:43.333
Gag me or not, I still gotta go
to the bathroom.

1:33:16.125 --> 1:33:18.125
Who's running point on this shit-show?

1:33:19.583 --> 1:33:20.875
Get that fuckin' sword out of my face.

1:33:20.958 --> 1:33:22.875
