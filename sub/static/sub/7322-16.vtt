IT'S JUST, I KIND OF... (sighs)

03:45.956 --> 03:48.799
I LIKE TO FIX THINGS--PEOPLE.
I LIKE TO FIX PEOPLE.

03:48.799 --> 03:50.901

DR. HUNT AND I--
OOH, DON'T,

03:50.901 --> 03:54.535
'CAUSE THEN YOU'RE JUST LYING,
AND THAT'S NO GOOD.

03:54.535 --> 03:56.867
MY POINT IS, YOU'RE STARING
AND YOU'RE SAD.

03:56.867 --> 03:59.270

PROBLEM SOLVED.
NOW FOR MY PATIENT.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.464
ELLIOT MEYER.
HE NEEDS A LUNG TRANSPLANT.

04:23.464 --> 04:25.966
OH, HEY. UH, I'M DOWN
WITH A L-LUNG TRANSPLANT.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.969
OH, NO... BECAUSE YOU SLEPT
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND,

04:28.969 --> 04:31.802
AND I FIND
THAT WHEN I LOOK AT YOU,

04:31.802 --> 04:34.375
I WANT TO HIT YOU
WITH A BRICK.
DUDE, THAT WAS, LIKE,
YEARS AGO.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.377

OF MY KIDS, THEY'LL TELL YOU,

04:38.979 --> 04:41.612
THERE'S NO REASONING
WITH A MONSTER.

04:41.612 --> 04:44.284
DUDE, RUN AWAY

DON'T JUDGE ME FOR THAT.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.289
SO... MY PATIENT,
BEEN TREATED...

04:49.289 --> 04:51.792
I GET IT. YOU'RE UPSET
LITTLE SLOAN IS GONE.

04:51.792 --> 04:55.326
BUT SCREWING DRUG REPS IS NOT
GONNA MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

04:55.326 --> 04:57.628
YEAH, IT IS.

04:57.628 --> 05:00.431
(sighs) NO SCREWING DRUG REPS
IN MY HOSPITAL. ARE WE CLEAR?

05:00.431 --> 05:02.673
YOU WERE MUCH MORE FUN
WHEN YOU WEREN'T CHIEF.

05:02.673 --> 05:04.675

05:14.044 --> 05:16.086
UH, WELL,
SO FAR, SO GOOD.

05:16.086 --> 05:18.088
I HAD TO DROP THIS OFF.

05:18.088 --> 05:20.090
I'M SORRY
YOU HAVE TO DO THIS.

05:20.090 --> 05:23.023
WELL, THIS DRUG TESTING,
IT'S PART OF THE REHAB PROGRAM.

05:23.023 --> 05:26.056
JUST RUN IT UNDER A JOHN DOE,
WOULD YOU?
OF COURSE.

05:26.056 --> 05:29.029
WHATEVER YOU NEED TODAY,
RICHARD, AND I MEAN THAT.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.402
A LOW-STRESS DAY,
LET'S START THERE--

05:31.402 --> 05:35.035
ROUTINE SURGERIES,
A LIGHT SCHEDULE, HOME BY 5:00.

05:35.035 --> 05:36.567
DONE.

05:38.869 --> 05:40.541
WELL...

05:40.541 --> 05:42.743
(sighs)

05:42.743 --> 05:45.746
YEAH, I SAID THAT.
SHE SLIPPED.

05:45.746 --> 05:47.778
THE ONLY PERSON
LIABLE HERE IS YOU

05:47.778 --> 05:50.721
FOR KEEPING ME
FROM MY SURGERY.
CALL MY DRIVER AND TELL HIM
THERE'S STILL TIME

05:50.721 --> 05:52.723
TO MAKE MY FLIGHT
IF HE COMES STRAIGHT HERE.

05:52.723 --> 05:55.926
YOU PASSED OUT IN A RESTAURANT
AND YOU HAVE ABDOMINAL PAIN.

05:55.926 --> 05:58.859
YOU'RE NOT
GETTING ON A PLANE.
THE PAIN'S GONE,
AND WHATEVER CAUSED IT

05:58.859 --> 06:00.931
CAN WAIT TILL I GET HOME.

06:00.931 --> 06:03.694
NOW LET ME OFF
OF THIS DAMN THING.
WE'RE DONE HERE, RIGHT?

06:03.694 --> 06:06.366
SIR, I NEED YOU TO MOVE
TO THIS GURNEY.
I GOT THIS, YANG.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.440
ALL RIGHT?
YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN SCRUBS.
SIR, I NEED YOU TO STAY CALM SO
I CAN DO A PROPER EXAMINATION.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.602
TELL THIS LADY
TO BACK OFF, JACKIE.
JACKIE?

06:11.602 --> 06:13.604
WHATEVER. IT'S NOT--

06:13.604 --> 06:15.676
LOOK, I'VE ALREADY PAGED BAILEY,
AND HE'S NOT CARDIO.

06:15.676 --> 06:18.949
SO YOU CAN
LOSE INTEREST, YANG.
YEAH, WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

06:18.949 --> 06:21.912
SIR, I'M A SURGEON,
A VERY GOOD ONE.
SO IS MY GRANDSON.

06:21.912 --> 06:25.385
SO WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE YOUR HANDS OFF ME?
WAIT, HE'S YOUR GRANDFATHER?

06:25.385 --> 06:28.659
I'M SERIOUS, OKAY? I CAN HANDLE
THIS TILL BAILEY GETS HERE.
NO, BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED
TO TREAT FAMILY MEMBERS,

06:28.659 --> 06:31.391
AND HE HAS MIDEPIGASTRIC
TENDERNESS AND GUARDING.

06:31.391 --> 06:33.624
IT COULD BE
ASCENDING CHOLANGITIS.

06:33.624 --> 06:34.925
ASCENDING CHOLANGITIS?
REALLY?

06:34.925 --> 06:39.700
WITH ONLY ONE OF THE SYMPTOMS
OF CHARCOT'S TRIAD?

06:39.700 --> 06:41.472
YOU'RE A DOCTOR?

06:41.472 --> 06:43.604
APPARENTLY A MUCH BETTER ONE
THAN YOU ARE.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.906
DR. HARPER AVERY.

06:45.906 --> 06:48.008
AND YOUR NAME, DOCTOR?

06:48.008 --> 06:49.780
HARPER AVERY.

06:49.780 --> 06:52.843
UH, NO.
THAT'S MY NAME.

06:52.843 --> 06:54.845
AS IN
THE HARPER AVERY AWARD?

06:54.845 --> 06:57.047
BINGO.
GET A NEW SURGEON, JACKIE,

06:57.047 --> 06:58.989
ONE WITH A PULSE THIS TIME.

06:58.989 --> 07:02.853
YOU'RE HARPER AVERY'S
GRANDSON?

07:05.025 --> 07:07.728
I MISDIAGNOSED HARPER AVERY
IN FRONT OF HARPER AVERY.

07:07.728 --> 07:10.461
DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT DOES
TO MY CHANCES

07:10.461 --> 07:13.464
OF ONE DAY WINNING
A HARPER AVERY?
WELL, HE COULD DIE
BEFORE THEN.

07:13.464 --> 07:16.467
I MEAN,
HE COULD DIE TODAY EVEN.
I JUST NEED TO OPERATE ON
MY MOTORCYCLE DAREDEVIL GUY,

07:16.467 --> 07:19.470
AND I'LL BE FINE.
IS IT TRUE
HARPER AVERY IS HERE?

07:19.470 --> 07:22.973
(groans)
(chuckling) SO DEREK WALKED IN
ON HER NAKED THIS MORNING

07:22.973 --> 07:24.475
IN ALEX'S BED.
MEREDITH!

07:24.475 --> 07:25.976
(laughing)
WHAT?

07:25.976 --> 07:28.479
OH, I'M JUST CHEERING HER UP.
SHE'S HAVING A BAD DAY.

07:28.479 --> 07:31.482
BE GENEROUS.
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU CAN'T BE
HAVING FEELINGS FOR KAREV.

07:31.482 --> 07:33.984
HE'S LIKE MEREDITH
THREE YEARS AGO.
I SAID THAT.

07:33.984 --> 07:36.957
I DON'T HAVE FEELINGS
FOR ALEX.
YES, YOU DO. YOUR HEART'S,
LIKE, IN YOUR VAGINA.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.959
I SAID THAT.
OH, MY GOD.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.961
YOU ARE BOTH MONSTERS.
WE'RE LIKE... (hums)

07:40.961 --> 07:42.963
YANG, I HEARD YOU MET
HARPER AVERY.

07:42.963 --> 07:46.066
DID YOU KNOW THAT PRETTY BOY'S
GRANDFATHER WAS GOD?

07:46.066 --> 07:48.068
I DIDN'T KNOW.
THAT IS KINDA COOL, THOUGH.

07:48.068 --> 07:49.770
NO, IT'S NOT COOL.

07:49.770 --> 07:52.102
OKAY, HE'S AN ENTITLED BRAT
WITH NO SKILLS

07:52.102 --> 07:54.204
EXCEPT
A REALLY GOOD BLOODLINE.

07:54.204 --> 07:57.748
IT IS NOT JACKSON'S FAULT THAT
HE'S RELATED TO HARPER AVERY.

07:57.748 --> 08:00.150
OH, WHATEVER,
ELLIS GREY'S DAUGHTER.
(inhales sharply)

08:01.852 --> 08:03.854
HUH?
HOW DO I LOOK?

08:03.854 --> 08:06.256
CHIEFLY?
WHAT, ARE YOU NERVOUS?

08:06.256 --> 08:09.019
HE'S ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL
SURGEONS IN THE COUNTRY.
HE'S JUST A GUY

08:09.019 --> 08:11.622
WHO HAPPENS TO HAVE
AN AWARD NAMED AFTER HIM.
WHATEVER,

08:11.622 --> 08:15.095
ELLIS GREY'S DAUGHTER. ADMIT IT.
YOU WANT TO MEET HIM, TOO.
HELL, YEAH.

08:15.095 --> 08:17.267
THANK YOU.

08:17.267 --> 08:21.131
HEY, WHERE ARE WE ON HIM?
HE WAS ON HIS WAY UP TO THE O.R.
WHEN HE STARTED BLEEDING OUT.

08:21.131 --> 08:23.273
WANT TO GIVE US
A HAND HERE, YANG?

08:23.273 --> 08:27.177
OH. BIG BOY NEEDS A LITTLE HELP.
NO PROBLEM. WATCH AND LEARN.

08:27.177 --> 08:29.079
CLAMP.

08:29.079 --> 08:32.883
SEE? THIS IS WHY
I DON'T WANT YOU TO DRIVE!
I HAD TO GET MY MEDICATION!

08:32.883 --> 08:34.945
THE STORE WAS GONNA CLOSE!
I'M SO--CAN WE NOT YELL?

08:34.945 --> 08:36.947
PLEASE. MAYBE.
NO, ACTUALLY.

08:36.947 --> 08:38.949
MY MOTHER'S
ALMOST COMPLETELY DEAF,

08:38.949 --> 08:41.091
A FACT SHE REFUSES TO ACCEPT,
WHICH IS WHY

08:41.091 --> 08:44.154
SHE WON'T LEARN SIGN LANGUAGE
OR GET A HEARING AID.

08:44.154 --> 08:46.296
SO WE YELL.
DON'T TALK TO HER.
TALK TO ME.

08:46.296 --> 08:48.258
I'M JUST TELLING THEM
WHAT HAPPENED!

08:48.258 --> 08:53.103
SHE STOLE MY CAR... AGAIN.
THERE'S A TENDERNESS OVER
THE ZYGOMATIC PROCESS

08:53.103 --> 08:57.267
AND A HEMATOMA
TO THE LEFT TEMPORAL AREA.
OKAY. RUN A HEAD AND FACE C.T.
I'LL GET SLOAN AND SHEPHERD.

08:57.267 --> 08:59.269
SHE'S GOT A RUPTURED TENDON
IN HER KNEE

08:59.269 --> 09:01.071
THAT WILL NEED SURGERY.

09:01.071 --> 09:03.774
SO SHE'LL BE OFF HER FEET
FOR A FEW WEEKS.

09:03.774 --> 09:05.976
SO MORE WAITING ON HER
HAND AND FOOT? BRILLIANT.

09:05.976 --> 09:10.050
I SAW THAT, KATHY!
THEY'RE TAKING YOU FOR SCANS!
THAT'S ALL WE SAID!

09:10.050 --> 09:12.953
JUST QUIET DOWN.
LET THE NICE DOCTOR DO HER WORK.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.826
WHY IS THIS TAKING SO LONG?!
SHH!

09:15.826 --> 09:19.159
IS IT ME OR ARE THOSE TWO WOMEN
TERRIBLY ANNOYING?
MY APOLOGIES, DR. AVERY.

09:19.159 --> 09:23.163
(women yelling indistinctly)
WE'RE WORKING ON GETTING YOU
UP TO YOUR OWN ROOM

09:23.163 --> 09:26.737
AS SOON AS POSS--
YOU SAID THAT BEFORE.
ARE YOU THE SAME SHEPHERD

09:26.737 --> 09:29.239
WHO DID THE CLINICAL TRIAL
ON THE GLIOMAS?
YES, SIR.

09:29.239 --> 09:32.072
YOU BROUGHT ME A NEUROSURGEON
FOR SOME ABDOMINAL CRAMPS?

09:32.072 --> 09:36.977
NO, I-I--DR. SHEPHERD
IS OUR CHIEF OF SURGERY, SIR.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.980
I DON'T NEED A CRUISE DIRECTOR.
I NEED AN EXPERIENCED SURGEON.

09:39.980 --> 09:42.012
PAGE DR. GREY.

09:42.012 --> 09:44.054
I'M DR. GREY.

09:44.054 --> 09:46.256
(laughs)

09:46.256 --> 09:49.760
EITHER THE WORLD'S MOST TALENTED
PLASTIC SURGEON WORKS HERE

09:49.760 --> 09:52.092
OR YOU'RE NOT ELLIS GREY.

09:52.092 --> 09:54.925
SHE WAS MY MOTHER.
SHE PASSED AWAY.

09:54.925 --> 09:57.097
OH.

09:57.097 --> 09:59.229
I-I DIDN'T KNOW.

09:59.229 --> 10:01.371
UH, MY CONDOLENCES.

10:01.371 --> 10:03.373

10:03.373 --> 10:05.976

STILL WORK HERE?

10:05.976 --> 10:07.107

10:07.107 --> 10:08.608
UH... UNFORTUNATELY,

DOING TO THAT MAN?!

10:17.217 --> 10:19.920

(Cristina) OH!
OKAY. APPLYING PRESSURE.

10:19.920 --> 10:22.152

INTO THE ROOM.
I'LL PAGE DR. WEBBER.

10:31.331 --> 10:35.165
AS YOU CAN SEE, YOU'VE GOT
DILATED BOWEL HERE AND HERE,

10:35.165 --> 10:36.807
INDICATING AN OBSTRUCTION.

10:36.807 --> 10:40.140
IT'S A GOOD THING
THAT OUR YOUNG DR. AVERY

10:40.140 --> 10:42.112
BROUGHT YOU STRAIGHT IN.

10:42.112 --> 10:45.275
DR. BAILEY CAN DO THE SURGERY
RIGHT AWAY.

10:45.275 --> 10:49.379
WAS IT A STUDENT, WEBBER?
A BOARD MEMBER'S WIFE?

10:49.379 --> 10:51.121
WHAT?

10:51.121 --> 10:53.123
NO ONE GIVES UP
A CHIEF OF SURGERY GIG,

10:53.123 --> 10:56.126
AND, UH, THEY DON'T ASK YOU
UNLESS IT'S FOR SOMETHING JUICY.

10:56.126 --> 10:58.428
SO WHO WERE YOU SLIPPING IT TO?
GRANDPA!

10:58.428 --> 11:00.190
I'M SORRY, DR. WEBBER.

11:00.190 --> 11:02.893
IT WAS A JOKE.
HE DOESN'T GET ME.

11:02.893 --> 11:05.295
SO, WEBBER?

11:05.295 --> 11:08.038
UH, DR. WEBBER DECIDED
TO FOCUS ON HIS RESEARCH.

11:08.038 --> 11:10.871
OH, THE RESEARCH LINE.
WELL, EITHER WAY,

11:10.871 --> 11:13.443
AT LEAST YOU'LL BE FREE
TO DO MY SURGERY.

11:13.443 --> 11:16.977
DR. BAILEY IS MORE THAN CAPABLE
OF PERFORMING THE SURGERY--

11:16.977 --> 11:19.179
I WANT WEBBER.
NO OFFENSE.

11:19.179 --> 11:21.181
NONE TAKEN.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.985
AND I WANT TO WATCH.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.286
WHAT?

11:26.286 --> 11:29.019
I'M GOING TO BE AWAKE
FOR MY SURGERY, WATCH.

11:29.019 --> 11:31.391
(exhales deeply)

11:31.391 --> 11:35.225
(lowered voice) SO MUCH
FOR THE LOW-STRESS DAY.
MM.

11:35.225 --> 11:38.969
A YEAR AFTER MR. MEYER'S
LYMPHOMA WENT INTO REMISSION,

11:38.969 --> 11:41.772
HE WAS DIAGNOSED
WITH PULMONARY FIBROSIS,

11:41.772 --> 11:43.774
A CONDITION THAT HE DEVELOPED
AS A SIDE EFFECT

11:43.774 --> 11:46.336
TO THE RADIATION HE RECEIVED
DURING HIS CANCER TREATMENTS.

11:46.336 --> 11:48.078
(woman)
THIS ISN'T NEW INFORMATION.

11:48.078 --> 11:50.180
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
YOU COULD HELP.

11:50.180 --> 11:52.182
YEAH, BUT THEY'RE NEW
TO THE CASE,

11:52.182 --> 11:54.945
AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO REVIEW
THE ENTIRE HISTORY.

11:54.945 --> 11:57.217
GREAT. UH, CAN'T YOU DO THAT
ON YOUR OWN TIME?
JILL. SORRY.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.220
MY SISTER USUALLY WAITS
A FEW MORE MINUTES

12:00.220 --> 12:02.923
BEFORE GOING FULL BITCH
ON NEW GUYS.

12:02.923 --> 12:05.055
ALL RIGHT. LET ME TELL YOU
WHAT I KNOW.

12:05.055 --> 12:07.798
IT IS GONNA BE VERY DIFFICULT
TO FIND YOU A NEW SET OF LUNGS.

12:07.798 --> 12:09.429
DONOR LUNGS ARE SCARCE.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.762
85% GET THROWN OUT

12:11.762 --> 12:14.464
BECAUSE THEY GET TOO INFLAMED
WHILE THE DONOR IS BRAIN DEAD.

12:14.464 --> 12:16.466
AND BECAUSE YOUR CANCER
COULD COME BACK

12:16.466 --> 12:19.409
WITH THE IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS
YOU'D BE ON,

12:19.409 --> 12:23.113
YOU ARE CONSIDERED
A VERY HIGH-RISK CANDIDATE.

12:23.113 --> 12:25.846
THERE ARE JUST TOO MANY
OTHER PATIENTS ON THE LIST

12:25.846 --> 12:27.317
THAT ARE LOWER RISK.

12:27.317 --> 12:29.850
ELLIOT SURVIVED LEUKEMIA
AND LYMPHOMA.

12:29.850 --> 12:33.153
NOBODY DOES THAT,
BUT HE DID.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.185
HE DESERVES LUNGS.

12:35.185 --> 12:37.187
UNFORTUNATELY,
THESE ARE THE RULES

12:37.187 --> 12:39.189
THE TRANSPLANT BOARD
SETS OUT.

12:39.189 --> 12:41.261
I... (sighs)

12:41.261 --> 12:43.533
I'M SORRY.

12:46.136 --> 12:49.139
DR. ALTMAN, HAVE YOU LOOKED
INTO THE RESEARCH THEY'RE DOING

12:49.139 --> 12:51.401
WITH EX VIVO TRANSPLANTS?
EX VIVO?

12:51.401 --> 12:54.104
WELL, IT'S A PROCEDURE WHERE
THEY TAKE DAMAGED DONOR LUNGS--

12:54.104 --> 12:56.106
THE ONES WE WOULD NORMALLY
THROW AWAY--

12:56.106 --> 12:58.308
AND REPAIR THEM ON BYPASS.
ARE WE DOING ONE?
LET ME GUESS.

12:58.308 --> 13:01.211
YOU WANT ON MY SERVICE
TO MAKE UP FOR THE FACT

13:01.211 --> 13:04.154
THAT YOU HUMILIATED YOURSELF
IN FRONT OF HARPER AVERY.
HOW'D YOU HEAR ABOUT THAT?

13:04.154 --> 13:06.516
YOU MADE FUN OF ME.

13:06.516 --> 13:08.188
OKAY. FINE.

13:08.188 --> 13:11.191
YES, I-I HUMILIATED MYSELF
IN FRONT OF HARPER AVERY.

13:11.191 --> 13:15.225
AND MY DAREDEVIL GORKED
BEFORE WE COULD OPERATE ON HIM.

13:15.225 --> 13:18.228
SO I AM AVAILABLE
FOR YOUR EX VIVO LUNG CASE.

13:18.228 --> 13:20.230
I DON'T HAVE
AN EX VIVO LUNG CASE

13:20.230 --> 13:22.903
BECAUSE IT'S ONLY BEEN DONE
IN SWITZERLAND AND IN CANADA

13:22.903 --> 13:25.906
ON PATIENTS IN MUCH BETTER SHAPE
THAN OUR PATIENT.

13:25.906 --> 13:27.207
YES, BUT...

13:27.207 --> 13:30.210
OKAY, PERFORMING A PROCEDURE
AS HARD-CORE AS THIS

13:30.210 --> 13:32.843
WHILE HARPER AVERY
IS IN THE HOSPITAL?

13:32.843 --> 13:35.886
WELL, I MEAN, HE COULD HEAR
ABOUT IT AND LIKE IT

13:35.886 --> 13:38.889
AND--AND HE'S A GOD
WHO HANDS OUT AWARDS.
YEAH, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT AWARDS.

13:38.889 --> 13:43.093
OH, COME ON. ONLY PEOPLE WHO
NEVER WIN AWARDS EVER SAY THAT.

13:43.093 --> 13:46.396
SO YOU THINK THIS COULD BE
AN EX VIVO LUNG CASE?

13:46.396 --> 13:48.428
I DO NOT HAVE FEELINGS
FOR ALEX.

13:48.428 --> 13:50.901
I DO NOT CARE.

13:54.304 --> 13:57.007
(speaking inaudibly)

13:57.007 --> 13:59.109
AH, HERE WE GO.

13:59.109 --> 14:01.171
HE'S GIVING THEM THE SPEECH.

14:01.171 --> 14:02.472
WHAT SPEECH?

14:02.472 --> 14:04.915
ABOUT THE WONDERS OF MEDICINE.

14:04.915 --> 14:06.917
ABOUT HOW AS SURGEONS,
YOU KNOW,

14:06.917 --> 14:09.019
WE'RE MEANT TO PUSH BOUNDARIES

14:09.019 --> 14:11.021
AND DO WHAT NO ONE
HAS EVER DONE.

14:11.021 --> 14:14.084
SOUNDS MOTIVATING.
IT'S CHEESY IS WHAT IT IS.

14:14.084 --> 14:16.086
AND YOU HEAR IT ENOUGH TIMES

14:16.086 --> 14:18.128
AT YOUR GRANDPARENTS'
DINNER TABLE,

14:18.128 --> 14:21.091
YOU CAN'T HELP BUT WANT TO BE
A SURGEON WHEN YOU GROW UP.
YOU HAD A DINNER TABLE?

14:21.091 --> 14:23.193
I DIDN'T KNOW WORLD-CLASS
SURGEONS HAD DINNER TABLES.

14:23.193 --> 14:25.195
I FEEL GYPED.
(chuckles)

14:25.195 --> 14:27.867
WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU HAVEN'T
HEARD THE SPEECH YET.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.869
...TO BE AWAKE
FOR MY OWN SURGERY,

14:29.869 --> 14:32.872
BUT AN OPPORTUNITY LIKE THIS,
TO BE A STUDENT AGAIN,

14:32.872 --> 14:34.174
GET A NEW PERSPECTIVE--

14:34.174 --> 14:36.446
IT'S WHAT WE GOT INTO
THIS BUSINESS FOR

14:36.446 --> 14:38.578
IN THE FIRST PLACE--

14:38.578 --> 14:41.581
THOSE MOMENTS THAT CHALLENGE
AND TERRIFY AND DARE US

14:41.581 --> 14:44.554

THAT WE WERE MEANT TO REACH.

14:44.554 --> 14:46.286
NO, LET'S STOP THE TALK

14:46.286 --> 14:49.589

WHAT IT MEANS TO BE GREAT.

14:55.265 --> 14:57.567

I'M SORRY. I CAN'T AUTHORIZE
AN AWAKE SURGERY, NO MATTER--

15:01.201 --> 15:03.103

18:27.337 --> 18:30.340
UH, WELL, THEY SAY THAT
IT ENHANCES CLINICAL JUDGMENT.

18:30.340 --> 18:33.213
I'M NOT REAL SURE.
(Lexie) I DON'T GET IT.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.445
WHY DOES HE GET TO SCRUB IN

18:35.445 --> 18:38.588
ON HIS OWN GRANDFATHER'S
AWAKE SURGERY?
THE SAME REASON WHY HARPER AVERY
PERSONALLY REQUESTED

18:38.588 --> 18:41.351
MEREDITH GREY
TO BE HIS RESIDENT.

18:41.351 --> 18:43.253
NEPOTISM SUCKS.

18:43.253 --> 18:46.656
HEY, YOU, UH,
WANT TO GO GRAB A BITE?

18:46.656 --> 18:48.358
NO. (chuckles)

18:48.358 --> 18:51.161
ACTUALLY, I AM...
(clears throat) FULL.

18:51.161 --> 18:53.463
REALLY? 'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T
SEEM FULL LAST NIGHT.

18:53.463 --> 18:55.335
I SAID NO.

18:55.335 --> 18:57.867
OKAY, I-I-I AM NOT HUNGRY
AT ALL.
(clears throat)

18:57.867 --> 18:59.869
SO JUST GO EAT ALONE.

18:59.869 --> 19:02.141
(Charles) EXCUSE ME.
SORRY.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.874
(doctors whispering
indistinctly)

19:04.874 --> 19:07.747
HEY, DOWN IN FRONT,
BIGFOOT.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.481
OH, IT'S BIGFOOT NOW.

19:11.481 --> 19:15.385
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT GUYS WITH BIG FEET.

19:15.385 --> 19:18.388
(Cristina) SHOULDN'T YOU BE OFF
LEARNING HOW TO BE A SURGEON

19:18.388 --> 19:20.390
AFTER YOU LET
MY DAREDEVIL DIE?

19:20.390 --> 19:22.392
MY DAREDEVIL?
HE DIDN'T DIE.

19:22.392 --> 19:23.893
AFTER YOU LEFT,

19:23.893 --> 19:25.895
I PERSONALLY HELPED PRESERVE
HIS HEART FUNCTION.

19:25.895 --> 19:28.268
NOW HE'S AN ORGAN DONOR.

19:28.268 --> 19:32.372
(indistinct whispering
continues)

19:32.372 --> 19:34.344
(Derek whispers) EXCUSE ME.

19:36.676 --> 19:40.410
(monitor beeping rapidly)

19:40.410 --> 19:42.882
(monitor beeping erratically)
B.P.'s DROPPING.

19:42.882 --> 19:45.315
I THINK I'VE GOT A BLEEDER.
SUCTION.

19:45.315 --> 19:47.717
DID YOU CHECK THE S.M.A.?
YES, IT'S OKAY.
DR. AVERY, STAY CALM.

19:47.717 --> 19:50.890
I'LL BE CALM
WHEN YOU FIND THE DAMN THING.

19:50.890 --> 19:54.524
(beeping continues)

19:54.524 --> 19:56.796
WHAT'S GOING ON, KATHY?

19:56.796 --> 19:59.229
YOU'RE SERIOUS?
MM-HMM.

19:59.229 --> 20:02.432
ALL THIS TIME, I JUST NEEDED
TO MAKE HER GO TO THE DOCTOR?
WELL,
THAT DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

20:02.432 --> 20:04.934
WHAT MATTERS IS THAT DR. SLOAN
CAN DO THE SURGERY

20:04.934 --> 20:07.277
RIGHT AFTER I OPERATE
ON THE KNEE.

20:07.277 --> 20:09.309
THAT ACCIDENT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
THE BEST THING

20:09.309 --> 20:11.511
THAT EVER HAPPENED TO YOU.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:11.511 --> 20:14.284
WHO ARE YOU?
(chuckles)

20:14.284 --> 20:16.586
YOU'RE LIKE SOME MIRACLE WORKER
OR SOMETHING.

20:16.586 --> 20:19.218
(laughs) THANK YOU.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.321
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.693
WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?

20:23.693 --> 20:24.924
MOM...

20:24.924 --> 20:27.457
DR. SLOAN CAN GIVE YOU
YOUR HEARING BACK!

20:27.457 --> 20:30.460
(lowered voice) DON'T YOU DARE
SLEEP WITH THAT WOMAN.
NO?

20:30.460 --> 20:32.462
WHAT?!
NO.

20:32.462 --> 20:35.405
DR. SLOAN,
COME AND TELL HER YOURSELF.

20:35.405 --> 20:39.369
(clears throat)

20:39.369 --> 20:42.241
MRS. NELSON!

20:42.241 --> 20:47.317
I'M DR. SLOAN! I HAVE
SOME VERY GOOD NEWS FOR YOU!

20:47.317 --> 20:49.819
(monitor beeping erratically)
OKAY,
SHOULDN'T WE PUT HIM OUT?

20:49.819 --> 20:53.483
NO, DON'T PUT ME OUT.
HANG ANOTHER UNIT OF F.F.P.

20:53.483 --> 20:55.425
(speaks incoherently)

20:55.425 --> 20:58.388
80 OVER 50.
THERE IT IS. THERE IT IS.
I'VE GOT IT.

20:58.388 --> 21:01.391
I'VE GOT IT.
(beeping normalizes)

21:01.391 --> 21:02.692
OKAY.

21:02.692 --> 21:05.264
HOW ARE YOU FEELING,
DR. AVERY?

21:05.264 --> 21:08.838
OKAY.
HEART RATE'S STABILIZING.

21:08.838 --> 21:12.372
HANG IN THERE JUST
A FEW MORE MINUTES, OKAY?

21:12.372 --> 21:14.544
3-0 SILK, BOKI.
SILK?

21:14.544 --> 21:18.378
NO, USE CHROMIC.
DON'T GET LAZY ON ME.

21:18.378 --> 21:20.550
YEP, HE'S FINE.

21:20.550 --> 21:22.312
(suction hisses)

21:22.312 --> 21:23.353
(gurgling)

21:23.353 --> 21:26.356
RIGHT.

21:26.356 --> 21:28.358
CHROMIC INSTEAD, BOKI.

21:28.358 --> 21:30.360
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

21:30.360 --> 21:31.891
YOU PAGED?

21:34.023 --> 21:36.796
OH, MY GOD. ARE YOU DOING
AN EX VIVO LUNG REPAIR?

21:36.796 --> 21:39.298
MY DAREDEVIL TURNED OUT
TO BE A MATCH.
YOU STOLE HIS LUNGS?

21:39.298 --> 21:41.531
NO, I DID NOT STEAL THEM.

21:41.531 --> 21:43.403
THE TRANSPLANT TEAM
REJECTED THEM

21:43.403 --> 21:46.376
AND WERE GONNA SEND THEM
TO MEDICAL WASTE,

21:46.376 --> 21:48.508
SO I JUST REDIRECTED THEM
TO MEDICAL RESEARCH.

21:48.508 --> 21:51.080
NOW DOES LEXOPEDIA
WANT TO BE BADASS

21:51.080 --> 21:54.043
AND HELP ME ON THIS THING
OR NOT?
OH, MY GOD. YEAH.

21:54.043 --> 21:56.045
OKAY,
SO I VENTILATED THE LUNGS

21:56.045 --> 21:58.388
WITH, UH, C-O-2 AND NITROGEN
FROM THE PUMP.

21:58.388 --> 22:00.750
HEY.
HEY.

22:00.750 --> 22:04.053
(chuckles)
UM, YOU HEAR ABOUT HARPER--
I HEARD ABOUT
YOUR MOTORCYCLE--OH.

22:04.053 --> 22:06.756
YOU GO. (chuckles)
NO. SORRY. YOU GO.

22:06.756 --> 22:09.058
UH, I WAS JUST GONNA SAY,
IT'S KINDA COOL,

22:09.058 --> 22:12.702
UH, HARPER AVERY BEING HERE.
YEAH. YEAH, YEAH, IT IS.

22:12.702 --> 22:14.704
AND, UH, UH, YOUR--
YOUR MOTORCYCLE GUY?

22:14.704 --> 22:17.036
OH, WE LOST HIM,
BUT HE'S A DONOR.

22:17.036 --> 22:18.938
WELL, THAT'S GOOD.

22:18.938 --> 22:21.110
(sighs)

22:21.110 --> 22:23.973
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD COME OVER
SOMETIME FOR DINNER.

22:23.973 --> 22:26.416
UH, CRISTINA--SHE--
WELL, SHE DOESN'T COOK,

22:26.416 --> 22:29.078
BUT IF YOU REMEMBER,
I DO A MEAN LASAGNA.

22:29.078 --> 22:31.551
(chuckles) SURE.

22:31.551 --> 22:32.722
REALLY?

22:32.722 --> 22:34.484
YEAH, YEAH. SOUNDS FUN.

22:34.484 --> 22:36.826
OKAY.

22:36.826 --> 22:38.127
(pager beeps)

22:38.127 --> 22:41.431
UH, I GOTTA GO.
ALL RIGHT, YEAH.

22:41.431 --> 22:42.892
UH, TALK TO YOU LATER.
MM-HMM.

22:42.892 --> 22:44.864
OKAY, I KNOW YOU LOVE YANG.

22:44.864 --> 22:46.866
SHE GIVES YOU
THE WARM AND FUZZIES

22:46.866 --> 22:49.739
WITH HER MAGICAL,
SPECIAL HEART SKILLS.

22:49.739 --> 22:51.100
BUT THOSE LUNGS
YOU'RE TRANSPLANTING

22:51.100 --> 22:53.102
BELONGED TO
A PATIENT OF MINE.

22:53.102 --> 22:55.905
AND IT WOULD MEAN A LOT
TO TURN HIS DEATH

22:55.905 --> 22:58.708
INTO SOMETHING MEANINGFUL--
I'M SORRY. WHAT LUNGS?

22:58.708 --> 23:01.080
YOU WENT BEHIND MY BACK.
YOU USED MY NAME.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.453
YES, YES, BUT WE FOLLOWED
THE PROTOCOL.

23:03.453 --> 23:06.656
WE DIDN'T TELL THE PATIENT.
YOU STOLE LUNGS, CRISTINA!

23:06.656 --> 23:10.159
WHICH THEY WERE ABOUT TO
THROW OUT. SHE WAS BEING GREEN.
OH, WELL, GREAT.
THEN I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

23:10.159 --> 23:12.562
ABOUT THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
THAT YOU SPENT

23:12.562 --> 23:15.665
AND THE FACT THAT NO ONE
IN THIS HOSPITAL

23:15.665 --> 23:17.667
HAS EVER TRIED THIS BEFORE.

23:17.667 --> 23:20.670
OH, MY GOD. THIS IS ABOUT
HARPER AVERY, ISN'T IT?

23:20.670 --> 23:22.672
THAT'S WHY YOU DID THIS?

23:22.672 --> 23:24.674
WHY IS THAT
SUCH A BAD THING?

23:24.674 --> 23:26.676
OKAY, THE POINT IS,
IS THAT WE COULD--

23:26.676 --> 23:29.679
YOU CAN PULL
THIS SURGERY OFF.
OH, WOW, THANK YOU.

23:29.679 --> 23:31.841
I MEAN, WHO NEEDS A HARPER AVERY
WHEN THEY'VE GOT

23:31.841 --> 23:34.143
THE CRISTINA YANG
SEAL OF APPROVAL?
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WAS SAYING.

23:34.143 --> 23:36.145
ALL OF
THIS AMBITION OF YOURS,

23:36.145 --> 23:38.147
THIS DESPERATE NEED
TO WIN PRIZES,

23:38.147 --> 23:40.189
IT MEANS YOUR PRIORITIES
ARE OFF.
HEY.

23:40.189 --> 23:43.122
IT DOESN'T. PRIZES PUSH US
TO BE BETTER.
THEY PUSH US TO BE MONSTERS.

23:43.122 --> 23:46.125
HEY.
OH, SO THE STATUS QUO--
NOT TRYING THEN--THAT'S WORSE.

23:46.125 --> 23:49.929
HEY! THE LUNGS--LOOK.
THEY'RE--THEY'RE VIABLE.

24:05.014 --> 24:07.016
A TRANSPLANT
WITH REPAIRED LUNGS

24:07.016 --> 24:09.448
HAS NEVER BEEN DONE
IN THE UNITED STATES.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.220
THE RISKS ARE TREMENDOUS,

24:11.220 --> 24:13.623
AND WITH THE AMOUNT OF
RADIATION THAT YOU SUSTAINED,

24:13.623 --> 24:16.085
THERE'S NO WAY OF KNOWING
HOW FRIABLE YOUR TISSUE IS

24:16.085 --> 24:18.758
OR IF YOU CAN EVEN SUSTAIN
A TRANSPLANT.
WAIT. I'M SORRY.

24:18.758 --> 24:21.891
ARE YOU SAYING
YOU RECOMMEND IT, THOUGH?
NO, THEY'RE SAYING

24:21.891 --> 24:24.564
THEY WANT TO GIVE US A PAIR
OF HAND-ME-DOWN LUNGS--

24:24.564 --> 24:27.737
THE ONES NO ONE ELSE WANTS.
(Cristina)
THESE ARE GOOD LUNGS.

24:27.737 --> 24:29.739
THIS PROCEDURE HAS ALLOWED US
TO REPAIR THEM

24:29.739 --> 24:32.772
SO THEY'RE VIRTUALLY
THE SAME AS--
NO! WE'LL WAIT.

24:32.772 --> 24:37.647
WE'LL WAIT UNTIL YOU GET
THE LUNGS THAT YOU DESERVE.

24:37.647 --> 24:40.850
YOU'RE SO USED TO FIGHTING,
YOU DON'T EVEN REALIZE...

24:40.850 --> 24:44.814
THIS IS IT.

24:44.814 --> 24:47.216
I AM SICK
AND I'M TIRED

24:47.216 --> 24:50.089
AND I AM READY.

24:50.089 --> 24:53.092
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,
MY AFFAIRS ARE IN ORDER.

24:53.092 --> 24:56.225
YOUR AFFAIRS ARE NOT IN ORDER.
DON'T YOU DARE SAY THAT.

24:56.225 --> 25:00.229
DR. ROBBINS, PLEASE.

NO, IT IS SAD AND PATHETIC.

26:17.907 --> 26:19.879
OKAY? AND YOU HAVE
A CHOICE HERE.

26:19.879 --> 26:22.581
SLOAN AND HER BABY LEAVING YOU
CAN EITHER BE THE WORST

26:22.581 --> 26:24.583
OR THE BEST THING
THAT HAPPENED TO YOU.

26:24.583 --> 26:27.787
YOU CAN GROWN UP, FIND A WOMAN
TO LOVE AND HAVE A BABY.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.790
OR YOU CAN BE THE ASS ATTENDING
WHO ABUSES THE RESIDENTS

26:30.790 --> 26:33.663
AND SCREWS WHATEVER WALKS
INTO THIS HOSPITAL.

26:33.663 --> 26:35.665
SO JUST PICK ONE.

26:35.665 --> 26:38.197
WOULD YOU
DRAPE THE EAR, PLEASE?

26:38.197 --> 26:41.070
LOOK, IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN,
ALL RIGHT?

26:41.070 --> 26:43.072
COME ON, MAN. FIVE MINUTES
WITH YOUR GRANDPAPPY.

26:43.072 --> 26:45.975
THAT'S ALL I ASK.
RIGHT, 'CAUSE THE TWO OF US
ARE SUCH GOOD FRIENDS.

26:45.975 --> 26:49.208
WELL, THIS WOULD GO A LONG WAY
TO HELP THAT.
(Charles) BACK OFF, KAREV,
IF ANYBODY'S A FRIEND HERE,

26:49.208 --> 26:51.280
IT'S ME.
YOU'RE NOT
MEETING HIM EITHER.

26:51.280 --> 26:54.243
DUDE, WHAT HAPPENED TO
MERCY WEST FOREVER?

26:54.243 --> 26:58.247
THAT WAS NEVER A THING.
NOW LEAVE.

26:58.247 --> 27:01.320
(residents speaking
indistinctly)

27:05.024 --> 27:06.325
I HATE IT.

27:06.325 --> 27:09.328
I HATE IT WHEN THEY KNOW
I'M RELATED TO HIM--

27:09.328 --> 27:11.160
THE WAY THEY TREAT ME,

27:11.160 --> 27:14.003
THE WAY THEY WATCH ME
AS SOON AS THEY FIND OUT.

27:14.003 --> 27:17.006
AND I KNOW THE NAME
HAS... HELPED,

27:17.006 --> 27:19.268
BUT HE IS NOT EASY.

27:19.268 --> 27:25.074
BRILLIANT, BUT REALLY NOT EASY
TO BE RELATED TO.

27:26.375 --> 27:28.217
(pager beeps)

27:28.217 --> 27:31.220
IT'S HIM. 9-1-1.

27:31.220 --> 27:33.322
WHAT IS IT? YOU PAGED?

27:33.322 --> 27:35.384
ARE YOU OKAY?

27:35.384 --> 27:39.358
WE NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO FINISH
OUR TALK FROM THIS MORNING.
OUR TALK?

27:39.358 --> 27:43.763
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
AND YOU BROUGHT DR. GREY.
THAT'S GOOD, ACTUALLY.

27:43.763 --> 27:45.765
ANSWER ME THIS TIME,
DR. GREY.

27:45.765 --> 27:48.197
IF A SPOT WAS BEING HELD
FOR YOU TO STUDY

27:48.197 --> 27:50.199
AT THE GREATEST HOSPITAL
IN THIS COUNTRY,

27:50.199 --> 27:52.702
WOULD YOU TURN IT DOWN?

27:52.702 --> 27:55.174
A SPOT? WELL--

27:55.174 --> 27:57.376
YEAH, HE SAVED A SPOT FOR ME
AT MASS GEN,

27:57.376 --> 27:59.248
EVER SINCE I GRADUATED,

27:59.248 --> 28:01.851
WHICH IS THE ONLY REASON
HE CAME TO VISIT--

28:01.851 --> 28:04.984
TO TRY TO CONVINCE ME
TO TAKE IT AGAIN.
IT'S AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY.

28:04.984 --> 28:07.817
AN OPPORTUNITY I DON'T WANT.
I DON'T WANT TO WORK FOR YOU.

28:07.817 --> 28:11.090
I DON'T WANT YOUR HELP.
I DON'T--LOOK, IT'S ENOUGH--
NO! I DECIDE
WHEN I'VE SAID ENOUGH.

28:11.090 --> 28:13.793
I--YOU--YOU THINK I AM
ARROGANT AND OVERBEARING,

28:13.793 --> 28:17.226
AND YOU'VE MADE THAT VERY CLEAR,
AND MAYBE I AM.

28:17.226 --> 28:20.299
