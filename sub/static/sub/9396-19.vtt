01:06.800 --> 01:08.165
How much for the wall?

01:08.268 --> 01:10.896
Come on, man, I'm serious.
I'll take it, the whole thing...

01:11.004 --> 01:13.404
the pink paint, the creepy clown.

01:13.640 --> 01:15.505
Look, I'll give you...

01:16.443 --> 01:19.310
$500 and whatever fell on the floor.

01:19.979 --> 01:22.812
-How you doing, Coop?
-Better than you, you little bitch.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.543
Come here and give your uncle some love.

01:27.020 --> 01:28.885
-It's good to see you, kid.
-Yeah.

01:32.025 --> 01:34.050
So, your mom called me.

01:34.294 --> 01:37.525
And I got to tell you, Nate,
if my big sister is calling me in...

01:37.597 --> 01:40.191
the situation is pretty effed up, you know?

01:40.400 --> 01:41.958
No, keep it.

01:42.469 --> 01:46.166
By the way, I could beat your ass for
looking like this, you handsome bastard.

01:46.239 --> 01:48.707
I mean, I'm starting to finally
feel good about myself.

01:48.775 --> 01:50.709
I'm a racecar driver.
I'm making a few bucks.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.938
-And now I got to compete with this?
-Dude, stop it.

01:53.012 --> 01:56.743
I'm serious. What's wrong with her?
Did you marry a blind girl? Unless it....

01:57.450 --> 02:01.443
Man, it's your gear, isn't it?
Okay, drop your shorts. Let's have a look.

02:01.521 --> 02:03.785
-Come on, let's see it.
-What are you doing here, man?

02:03.890 --> 02:05.687
Perspective, nephew.

02:06.192 --> 02:08.183
I'm here to adjust yours.

02:56.442 --> 02:58.103
Hey, Brooke, you decent?

02:58.178 --> 03:00.009
Am I dressed? Yes.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.108
Am I decent? I never have been.

03:04.517 --> 03:06.246
What time is it, anyway?

03:06.319 --> 03:10.119
It's early. I'm sorry to wake you.
I just got to stash something in my closet.

03:10.190 --> 03:11.179
Okay.

03:11.257 --> 03:13.623
So, I went to see Jake.

03:14.727 --> 03:16.456
How's Peyton doing, anyway?

03:17.830 --> 03:20.526
-I'm worried about her.
-Yeah, me, too.

03:22.569 --> 03:23.797
It's hard, isn't it?

03:23.903 --> 03:26.736
Being apart from the person
you care about.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.134
Yeah.

03:30.276 --> 03:33.768
-So, what's in the bag, anyway?
-I don't know yet.

03:34.714 --> 03:38.741
Anyway, apparently I'm taking a road trip
with Nathan and his uncle.

03:38.818 --> 03:42.549
So, just tell Peyton
if she needs anything, that....

03:42.989 --> 03:45.184
Sure. I got her.

03:48.661 --> 03:49.855
Thanks.

03:51.798 --> 03:52.992
See ya.

03:55.034 --> 03:58.731
On the first day of this class I presented
you with a controversial notion...

03:58.838 --> 04:02.001
that ethics matter more than profits.
Anyone buying that yet?

04:05.144 --> 04:07.271
-Yes?
-Yeah, I have a question.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.545
May I ask what you're doing
in my classroom?

04:13.820 --> 04:15.082
Auditing.

04:15.622 --> 04:19.524
I was wondering,
what would you say about a person...

04:19.591 --> 04:22.720
let's call this person ''Randy.''

04:22.895 --> 04:26.626
Randy hires a private investigator
to dig up dirt on a competitor.

04:26.766 --> 04:29.428
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to
ask you to leave.

04:30.236 --> 04:31.567
Of course.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.967
One last question.

04:37.143 --> 04:40.579
Let's say our guy Randy
was teaching a class on ethics...

04:40.647 --> 04:45.516
and yet was sleeping
with one of his students.

04:45.818 --> 04:49.310
And let's call her ''Sharon.''

04:55.728 --> 04:58.720
And Sharon was getting an A.

04:59.699 --> 05:02.998
It seems to me that Randy
is not only a hypocrite...

05:03.202 --> 05:05.762
but also a candidate for dismissal.

05:16.015 --> 05:17.243
Discuss.

05:28.294 --> 05:31.525
So, Coop, how great is it
that you get to race cars for a living?

05:31.631 --> 05:35.260
You know, fame, money,
extremely hot wives.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.496
-Ex-wives.
-Look who's talking.

05:38.237 --> 05:39.363
Check it out.

05:42.275 --> 05:46.336
I'll tell you what,
there's only one view better than this one.

05:46.679 --> 05:47.941
That one.

05:56.089 --> 05:58.421
-This is Jeff Burton's car.
-Yes, it is.

05:59.092 --> 06:00.650
You guys want to meet him?

06:01.561 --> 06:04.029
-Hey, Jeff.
-Hey, Coop.

06:04.163 --> 06:06.290
These two knuckleheads are fans of yours.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.027
Is that right? How you guys doing?

06:08.101 --> 06:09.466
-Good.
-Good.

06:09.569 --> 06:12.003
Your car looks really fast out there.
Who's driving it?

06:12.071 --> 06:15.802
-That's my crew chief, Ray Green.
-Yeah. I know Ray. He's a good man.

06:16.008 --> 06:18.704
-It's a shame what happened.
-Yeah, it is.

06:18.845 --> 06:21.006
Look, you guys stay out of trouble.

06:21.080 --> 06:22.945
-I'll see you in Darlington.
-You got it.

06:27.620 --> 06:29.747
So, Jeff Burton mentioned Ray Green.

06:29.822 --> 06:32.222
Isn't he the guy that
took a swing at his team owner?

06:32.291 --> 06:33.758
Yeah. That team owner was my dad.

06:33.826 --> 06:36.021
He couldn't get a sponsor
to touch him after that.

06:36.095 --> 06:38.256
I found him about five years ago
down in Florida.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.663
He was trying to drink
all the Scotch in South Beach.

06:40.733 --> 06:43.167
It was bourbon.

06:43.336 --> 06:46.828
If I knew what a pain in the ass you were
gonna be, I'd have finished the job.

06:46.906 --> 06:47.930
Ray, let me ask you a question.

06:48.007 --> 06:50.532
I'm not a real smart guy,
but if you're not in my car...

06:50.610 --> 06:52.805
and I'm not in my car, who is?

06:52.979 --> 06:54.071
Hey, Tony.

07:01.053 --> 07:02.247
No way.

07:03.990 --> 07:06.424
It's still not right, Dad. Tight in, loose off.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.085
Nate, you remember my daughter,
Daytona?

07:10.229 --> 07:13.790
-You got your braces off.
-Yeah, like four years ago.

07:14.967 --> 07:18.425
-It's so good to see you.
-It's good to see you, too.

07:45.565 --> 07:48.159
So, Daytona, how long has it been
since you've seen Nate?

07:48.234 --> 07:50.725
Well, I think the last time I saw him,
he was shorter than me.

07:50.803 --> 07:53.567
-By, like, half an inch.
-Whatever, shorty.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.670
We don't let visitors in here.

07:57.243 --> 08:00.542
This is all high-tech, you know,
complicated, secret stuff.

08:01.347 --> 08:02.575
Come on.

08:03.683 --> 08:07.710
-So, Lucas, this is my little brother, Jarret.
-What's up?

08:07.820 --> 08:11.722
-Hey, I'm Lucas, Nathan's brother.
-Your mom's Cooper's sister?

08:11.791 --> 08:13.952
My mom slept with
Cooper's sister's husband.

08:14.026 --> 08:17.120
Okay. Whatever that means.
Sounds messed up.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.390
It is.

08:19.365 --> 08:21.196
-You want to hop in a car?
-Can I?

08:21.267 --> 08:22.256
-Yeah.
-Come on.

08:24.270 --> 08:27.137
-Man. I haven't seen you in forever.
-I know.

08:27.206 --> 08:30.403
How's that marriage thing going?

08:31.544 --> 08:32.943
Not so good.

08:33.479 --> 08:34.969
Man, that sucks.

08:35.248 --> 08:38.274
-Yeah, tell me about it.
-No, I mean...

08:39.150 --> 08:43.451
you're gonna be, like, divorced
before I even get a girl to date me.

08:46.792 --> 08:47.918
Oh, yeah.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.753
What do you think, Luke?

08:51.397 --> 08:54.662
-This is awesome.
-You guys want to drive them?

08:55.001 --> 08:56.832
-Are you serious?
-Yep.

08:57.203 --> 09:00.969
You can take a crash course today,
you learn about the cars and the track.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.940
Spend the night
and you can race tomorrow. How about it?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.936
Dude, I am so there.

09:07.013 --> 09:08.480
-Nathan?
-Hell, yeah.

09:08.648 --> 09:10.775
-Me, too?
-No.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.320
Andy, the man has to be stopped.

09:15.888 --> 09:19.153
The fact that he would waltz
into your classroom and insinuate....

09:19.992 --> 09:23.223
You know something, I'm not
sure how I was gonna tell Deb...

09:23.296 --> 09:27.926
about his little arrangement with Jules,
Emily, whoever the hell she was.

09:28.034 --> 09:31.993
But now I hope Deb destroys him.
Peyton's here.

09:32.104 --> 09:33.332
Okay, bye.

09:34.273 --> 09:38.232
-Hi, Peyton. How's Jake?
-The same.

09:39.679 --> 09:41.670
Is there anything I can do for you?

09:42.481 --> 09:45.848
Sure. You can tell Brooke that I'm fine.

09:45.918 --> 09:48.284
Actually, I was a little worried
about you, too.

09:48.354 --> 09:50.379
So we thought we'd all spend
the day together.

09:50.456 --> 09:53.687
Okay, I love you both for all the caring...

09:53.759 --> 09:57.126
but, kind of, creepy attention
you've been giving me...

09:57.263 --> 09:59.959
but what's wrong
with wearing a little misery now and then?

10:00.032 --> 10:01.966
This whole thing sucks for Jake.

10:03.002 --> 10:05.835
And why can't I be bummed for a little bit?

10:05.905 --> 10:08.840
You can totally be bummed.
You just have to do it with us...

10:08.908 --> 10:11.843
and you have to do really fun stuff
while you're bumming.

10:13.913 --> 10:16.780
How you doing, boozy?

10:16.949 --> 10:18.541
Great, actually.

10:18.684 --> 10:21.209
As a matter of fact,
I'm turning over a new leaf.

10:21.454 --> 10:25.356
From now on, I'm looking on
the bright side of things, staying positive.

10:25.424 --> 10:27.722
Dan paid Jules to seduce Keith.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.729
Life sucks. I need a drink.

10:45.911 --> 10:48.971
Okay, so, you want to enter turn one high.

10:49.415 --> 10:51.440
And then take this groove.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.718
-So, you guys hear that new 50 Cent?
-Jarret, they need to pay attention.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.620
Yeah, I got that. It's pretty good.

10:59.692 --> 11:02.525
What's up with Tony Yayo?
Is he, like, in jail or out of jail, or what?

11:02.628 --> 11:06.394
It's great that you want to talk G Unit
hip-hop with my little brother...

11:06.465 --> 11:09.798
but if you make a mistake
at 160 miles an hour...

11:09.869 --> 11:12.599
it's gonna be a lot more
than your heart that's broken.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.832
Whatever. No girl's gonna
outdrive me, anyway.

11:16.976 --> 11:17.965
Okay.

11:26.118 --> 11:28.552
-I miss Nathan.
-I miss Keith.

11:28.754 --> 11:30.051
I miss Jake.

11:30.122 --> 11:33.853
I don't really miss Felix at all,
or my parents that much.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.621
But I miss my money.

11:40.433 --> 11:43.766
You know what I always do
when I need to feel better?

11:43.836 --> 11:44.996
Drink?

11:46.439 --> 11:48.930
No. Dance.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.601
What?

12:04.757 --> 12:06.850
-Come on, Peyton.
-Deb, no.

12:06.926 --> 12:08.359
-Shut up and dance.
-Okay.

12:08.427 --> 12:09.621
I'm with her.

12:18.537 --> 12:21.802
-Come on, Karen. Dance to my divorce.
-Come on.

12:23.342 --> 12:25.310
Oh, hell. I can dance to that.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.206
The one thing that drives me crazy
about home schooling...

12:59.278 --> 13:01.974
is just getting behind in all the fashions.

13:02.047 --> 13:05.574
And also every now and then,
I like to, you know, catch up on the gossip.

13:05.651 --> 13:10.054
-I don't know. Is that wrong of me?
-You might just want to watch the track.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.216
Okay, Daytona, we get the point.
You don't need to get all crazy.

13:13.292 --> 13:14.782
You think this is crazy?

13:15.828 --> 13:18.058
No. This would be.

14:06.378 --> 14:08.676
So, a student reported
my relationship with you.

14:10.149 --> 14:12.777
I have to see the Dean. Tonight.

14:24.630 --> 14:26.962
Tell me you don't
live in a tent all year around.

14:27.099 --> 14:29.863
No. It's just nice to get out
under the stars sometimes.

14:30.002 --> 14:33.028
Plus, Jarret hates it, so that's a plus.

14:33.873 --> 14:37.400
-You gonna play something?
-What do you want to hear? NWA?

14:39.044 --> 14:41.706
-Maybe a little Tupac?
-Surprise us.

14:42.615 --> 14:43.707
Okay.

14:46.018 --> 14:49.715
<i>Dancing when the stars go blue</i>

14:51.590 --> 14:55.185
<i>Dancing when the evening fell</i>

14:56.562 --> 15:00.589
<i>Dancing in your wooden shoes</i>

15:01.800 --> 15:04.598
<i>ln a wedding gown</i>

15:06.005 --> 15:07.870
What? It's Ryan Adams.

15:10.542 --> 15:14.410
-Did it suck that bad?
-No. It's not that.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.444
It's a Haley thing.

15:19.451 --> 15:22.943
I just wish there was something
I could do to help him.

15:24.189 --> 15:29.126
-What was he like when you were kids?
-He was kind.

15:29.995 --> 15:33.226
Just a really sweet guy...

15:34.500 --> 15:38.197
-and a good friend, pre-basketball.
-Yeah.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.601
By the way, your marshmallow's on fire.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.341
You know, Mrs. Scott,
you really had a lot to drink.

15:47.780 --> 15:52.717
-Are you sure I can't walk you to the door?
-No. I'm fine. Thank you so much, Brooke.

15:52.785 --> 15:53.877
Okay.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.312
Say hi to your big
expensive house for me.

16:01.927 --> 16:03.690
Okay, nighty night.

16:20.212 --> 16:21.372
Mouth?

16:22.715 --> 16:26.014
-I am so wasted.
-Why? What happened?

16:27.386 --> 16:30.583
You know,
I've just been partying all night...

16:30.756 --> 16:32.519
and, like, drinking.

16:33.125 --> 16:34.717
I can see that.

16:36.595 --> 16:39.928
-Let's get you home.
-No.

16:40.165 --> 16:42.827
I mean, we should drive around
for a while...

16:43.002 --> 16:46.165
because, you know, my parents are home.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.734
I totally get it,
but I have to take you somewhere...

16:51.810 --> 16:53.801
'cause I can only do one ride at a time.

16:53.879 --> 16:57.007
Are you sure? 'Cause I am
really messed up on the hooch.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.841
I'm sorry, Mouth. Those are the rules.

16:59.918 --> 17:02.512
Okay, here's the deal, I'm not drunk.
I just....

17:02.588 --> 17:06.115
I knew your shift was tonight,
and I wanted to hang out.

17:07.059 --> 17:08.252
Sorry.

17:08.394 --> 17:11.363
You are so lucky I am lonely tonight.

17:11.696 --> 17:13.688
-Hop up front.
-Score.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.663
-I can't believe you.
-Ow. Sorry.

17:20.672 --> 17:22.070
How'd it go?

17:22.808 --> 17:24.469
What did he say?

17:25.544 --> 17:28.775
The Dean presented me with two options.

17:30.315 --> 17:32.875
Either I end the relationship...

17:33.185 --> 17:36.120
or, I lose my job.

17:37.790 --> 17:39.917
-There's got to be someone--
-So I quit.

17:40.959 --> 17:43.894
-Andy, you love teaching.
-Not as much as I love you.

17:48.767 --> 17:51.634
-I'm so sorry.
-It was a no-brainer, Karen.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.895
There'll be other teaching positions.

17:55.074 --> 17:57.565
But I hope there's never
another woman in my life.

18:20.833 --> 18:21.993
Erica?

18:22.801 --> 18:24.291
What happened?

18:25.637 --> 18:27.229
Nothing, really.

18:28.173 --> 18:31.165
I was hanging out with some
of the guys from Felix's party...

18:31.477 --> 18:33.570
and it just kind of got out of hand.

18:34.279 --> 18:36.577
-Out of hand how?
-Nothing major.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.476
Just grabby and...

18:41.320 --> 18:43.948
-not what I expected.
-You sure that's all it was?

18:46.024 --> 18:48.151
I'm sorry those guys were like that.

18:52.998 --> 18:54.192
Thanks.

18:56.001 --> 18:58.526
I feel stupid for even calling. It's just....

18:58.604 --> 19:01.767
I got scared and, I don't know...

19:03.642 --> 19:05.109
disappointed.

19:08.113 --> 19:09.546
I'm glad you called...

19:09.615 --> 19:11.845
because we were just about
to get some food.

19:13.085 --> 19:16.145
Yeah. What do you say, Marsh? You in?

19:16.421 --> 19:19.982
Okay. But call me Erica.

19:26.064 --> 19:28.862
You know, when my wife left,
I was a mess.

19:30.035 --> 19:31.969
You saying you're not still a mess?

19:32.204 --> 19:34.798
I mean, you should've been.
Carrie was really hot.

19:34.873 --> 19:37.501
Yeah, they usually are
when they're supermodels.

19:37.643 --> 19:39.508
And by the way, shut up.

19:40.045 --> 19:41.979
I had to let it all go, you know...

19:42.080 --> 19:45.447
the feeling that I wasn't
good enough for Carrie...

19:46.418 --> 19:51.014
how much I resented the fact
that she wanted things besides me.

19:51.456 --> 19:53.686
I mean, it wasn't fair to her.

19:53.959 --> 19:56.894
Hell, I wasn't gonna give up racing for her.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.894
I would've.

19:59.264 --> 20:01.755
I mean, given up basketball for Haley.

20:03.635 --> 20:05.034
I kind of did.

20:06.305 --> 20:07.795
You think...

20:08.340 --> 20:10.467
maybe that's the reason she left?

20:11.743 --> 20:15.839
I mean, when you met her,
would you have given it up then?

20:18.383 --> 20:20.010
No, probably not.

20:22.154 --> 20:25.555
Maybe you're not the person
she fell in love with anymore, man.

20:25.624 --> 20:28.491
Maybe she's not the person
you thought she was.

20:30.329 --> 20:33.890
Look, I don't say this to hurt you, Nate...

20:34.800 --> 20:36.529
but it's just....

20:37.703 --> 20:39.830
People change, you know.

20:43.909 --> 20:46.343
So, after she left you, I mean...

20:46.612 --> 20:49.581
was there ever a day when it felt better?

20:49.648 --> 20:53.049
Sure. Followed by a day
when it felt worse.

20:53.118 --> 20:54.983
I mean, that's just the way it goes.

20:55.053 --> 20:59.114
But I got to tell you, you'd be amazed at
how therapeutic 200 miles an hour can be.

21:01.727 --> 21:03.217
I'll bet, man.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.487
Look, Nate...

21:09.334 --> 21:11.199
love is a pretty great thing, man.

21:12.337 --> 21:14.396
Maybe it's the greatest thing.

21:15.807 --> 21:19.868
But it's got to be true love
for the both of you.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.147
What if it was?

21:24.549 --> 21:28.781
-What if it still is?
-If it still is, man, you fight like hell for it.

21:31.423 --> 21:35.553
But the harder question is,
''What if it wasn't?''

21:37.362 --> 21:40.490
Trust me, that one's a bitch.

21:56.615 --> 21:59.448
I think you're on the wrong side
of the desk, little man.

21:59.551 --> 22:02.179
I think you're on the wrong side of me.

22:03.488 --> 22:06.389
-I lost my teaching position tonight.
-Really?

22:06.758 --> 22:09.056
That's terrible. What happened?

22:12.397 --> 22:14.456
-Do you have any faith, Dan?
-Faith?

22:14.700 --> 22:17.965
You know, do you believe in anything?

22:18.737 --> 22:23.037
God? Science? Karma?

22:23.175 --> 22:25.575
No, I don't believe in karma.

22:25.711 --> 22:29.579
But I do believe I'll give you a chance to
remove yourself from my establishment...

22:29.715 --> 22:31.342
before I personally remove you.

22:38.990 --> 22:41.823
You know, we're very different, you and I.

22:43.962 --> 22:45.930
See, I'm a big believer in karma.

22:46.365 --> 22:49.129
I think it's amazing how,
most of the time...

22:49.201 --> 22:52.398
tragedy befalls a man
who just isn't living right.

22:53.638 --> 22:55.868
You know,
if you're gonna threaten me, kid...

22:55.974 --> 22:57.999
at least do it like a man.

22:59.077 --> 23:01.409
Karma finds us all in time, Dan.

23:01.546 --> 23:06.108
But, you know, I find that sometimes it
helps to just point it in the right direction.

23:10.155 --> 23:11.247
Wait.

23:15.494 --> 23:20.022
You should take a job application.
I mean, now that you're unemployed.

23:59.237 --> 24:02.035
You know, an hour ago
I wouldn't have believed it...

24:02.207 --> 24:06.974
but it's turned out to be a pretty night.
Thank you for hanging out with me.

24:07.379 --> 24:10.109
You're welcome.
We should get you home, though.

24:10.315 --> 24:12.943
-No, I think I'll walk.
-Are you sure?

24:14.553 --> 24:17.716
-Okay. Call if you need anything.
-I will. See ya.

24:20.425 --> 24:22.222
Hey, you wanna walk with me?

24:22.427 --> 24:24.588
I'd love to, but I have to finish my shift.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.824
I know. I meant you.

24:28.667 --> 24:29.759
Okay.

24:34.673 --> 24:36.004
I'm sorry, Brooke.

24:36.074 --> 24:39.066
Did you want me to hang out with you
for the rest of your shift?

24:39.144 --> 24:41.408
-No, it's fine. You should go.
-Are you sure?

24:41.513 --> 24:43.674
Yeah. Go get her, tiger.

24:54.359 --> 24:55.621
Hello?

24:57.462 --> 25:00.158
Hi. Is this the Safe Rides Program?

25:00.899 --> 25:02.127
It sure is.

25:02.300 --> 25:05.360
I was wondering
if you could come pick me up.

25:05.770 --> 25:07.260
-Of course.
-Good.

25:07.405 --> 25:09.839
I'd love to feel safe for a night.

25:10.775 --> 25:11.764
<i>Thanks.</i>

25:33.298 --> 25:35.459
Thanks for walking me home, Mouth.

25:35.567 --> 25:38.331
No problem. Thanks for inviting me.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.267
Well, I guess I'll see you.

25:45.510 --> 25:48.377
I loved what you said about Brooke
during the campaign...

25:48.547 --> 25:51.277
even though it's pretty much
the reason I lost.

25:51.516 --> 25:55.418
I suppose there's no reason
to ask you out then?

25:56.354 --> 25:58.219
Like, on a date?

25:59.291 --> 26:01.589
I was kind of pretending this was a date.

26:03.328 --> 26:06.297
Okay. Did we have fun?

26:07.766 --> 26:09.097
You tell me.

26:16.975 --> 26:20.536
-I think we had a blast.
-We did.

26:22.013 --> 26:23.742
-Good night.
-Night.

26:29.788 --> 26:30.846
Yes!

27:19.304 --> 27:22.000
AII right. Four cars. Three laps.

27:22.774 --> 27:25.504
You can all talk on an open frequency
in your helmets.

27:25.610 --> 27:28.010
Now, if you get a little squirrelly
out there...

27:28.146 --> 27:31.741
just take your foot off the gas, downshift,
and either come into the pits...

27:31.816 --> 27:33.716
or pull the car on the inside apron.

27:34.052 --> 27:37.419
There's a tach in your car,
tells you the rpm.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.185
When it hits six,
you're up around 140 miles an hour.

27:40.358 --> 27:41.916
Nobody goes to seven.

27:43.094 --> 27:44.288
Got it?

27:45.697 --> 27:48.291
AII right, Jarret will lead you
out in the pace car.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.493
Jarret, don't wreck the pace car.

27:50.735 --> 27:52.498
Okay. May the best man win.

27:52.771 --> 27:54.864
That should eliminate you three girls.

28:01.513 --> 28:02.810
Good luck, Nate.

28:18.763 --> 28:21.095
-Gentlemen.
-Hello!

28:21.499 --> 28:23.194
And beautiful ladies.

28:25.303 --> 28:26.998
Start your engines.

28:47.692 --> 28:49.091
<i>This is stinking great!</i>

28:56.000 --> 28:58.161
<i>You sure you boys want to be humiliated?</i>

28:59.270 --> 29:00.669
<i>Notice he didn't say ''girl''?</i>

29:01.206 --> 29:03.538
<i>Shoot, you'll all be lucky if I don't lap you.</i>

29:11.616 --> 29:12.776
<i>You ready, guys?</i>

29:12.851 --> 29:13.943
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

29:16.921 --> 29:18.718
<i>-Nathan?</i>
<i>-Let's do this.</i>

29:51.422 --> 29:54.619
<i>So I was thinking maybe I should</i>
<i>just drive in reverse for a while...</i>

29:54.726 --> 29:55.954
<i>just to make it close.</i>

30:07.038 --> 30:08.596
<i>Nate, coming up on your left.</i>

30:26.191 --> 30:29.251
<i>So, what's going on back here</i>
<i>in the slow part of the world?</i>

30:45.143 --> 30:47.111
<i>Is that my punky nephew?</i>

30:58.890 --> 31:01.324
<i>All right, last lap, Nate.</i>
<i>You'd better bring it.</i>

31:04.696 --> 31:07.062
<i>The low line is closed, my friend.</i>

31:08.900 --> 31:10.265
<i>And the high side.</i>

31:16.474 --> 31:17.463
<i>Well, well.</i>

31:17.542 --> 31:20.534
<i>That was almost impressive,</i>
<i>even for a knucklehead like you.</i>

31:31.856 --> 31:34.450
<i>Looks like you got</i>
<i>some competition out there, Cooper.</i>

31:34.525 --> 31:36.618
<i>Block him low, Nate, and he's yours.</i>

31:38.162 --> 31:39.288
<i>You got him, Nate.</i>

31:40.398 --> 31:42.025
<i>Gut-check time, nephew.</i>

31:48.439 --> 31:49.963
<i>Nathan, I love you...</i>

31:50.041 --> 31:52.373
<i>but I sure hope</i>
<i>you brought a change of shorts.</i>

32:01.152 --> 32:03.677
<i>No, Cooper, you did not just bump him.</i>

32:07.959 --> 32:09.950
<i>Revving's racing, Nathan.</i>

32:13.998 --> 32:16.626
<i>Looks like another checkered flag for me.</i>

32:16.701 --> 32:18.566
<i>Thank you very much.</i>

32:19.971 --> 32:22.769
<i>Good try, Nate. Nice run, guys.</i>

32:24.442 --> 32:27.468
<i>Tony, were you in second place</i>
<i>or third from last?</i>

32:28.846 --> 32:30.837
<i>Okay, bring it into the pits.</i>

32:49.767 --> 32:52.429
<i>Nathan, you not only</i>
<i>missed your pit stall...</i>

32:52.503 --> 32:54.801
<i>you just broke a half dozen pit road rules.</i>

32:58.476 --> 33:02.435
<i>Nathan, that's the first victory lap</i>
<i>I've ever seen for last place. I like it.</i>

33:08.052 --> 33:09.485
<i>Hey, Nate, you all right?</i>

33:20.965 --> 33:23.763
<i>Nathan, you reduce your speed</i>
<i>and you come in.</i>

33:23.868 --> 33:25.335
<i>You know what I need, Coop?</i>

33:25.403 --> 33:28.270
<i>Some of that 200-mile-an-hour</i>
<i>therapy you were talking about.</i>

33:28.339 --> 33:29.601
<i>Nathan?</i>

33:33.444 --> 33:36.311
<i>Nobody goes past seven</i>
<i>on the tach, right?</i>

33:36.881 --> 33:38.280
<i>Let's see about eight.</i>

33:47.558 --> 33:48.991
<i>-No. Too fast.</i>
<i>-Nathan!</i>

33:49.060 --> 33:52.257
<i>You were right, Coop.</i>
<i>This feels pretty damn good.</i>

34:29.900 --> 34:30.925
Nathan!

34:46.217 --> 34:48.150
We've got to get him out of here! Help me!

34:59.230 --> 35:00.458
Come on!

35:01.165 --> 35:02.530
Come on, buddy!

35:06.003 --> 35:09.939
Nathan! Come on!

35:10.641 --> 35:13.109
Hold on, buddy!

35:28.025 --> 35:32.155
I've got severe respiratory distress.
Heart rate accelerating. He's tachycardic.

35:32.396 --> 35:34.990
-You've been in an accident, son.
-You'll be okay, Nate.

35:35.066 --> 35:36.658
We're right here, buddy.

35:37.468 --> 35:39.060
-Promise me....
-Anything.

35:39.203 --> 35:40.397
Six units of blood!

35:41.105 --> 35:42.868
Don't call Haley.

35:43.040 --> 35:44.598
Let's take him to the O.R.

36:00.491 --> 36:04.393
Well, well. It's my wife, the lawn gnome.

36:06.197 --> 36:09.724
You gonna tell me where
you were all night, Anna Nicole?

36:16.340 --> 36:20.003
-We're leaving again, are we?
-I know about what you did to Keith.

36:20.745 --> 36:21.939
I see.

36:22.613 --> 36:26.447
-What's all this?
-I'm boiling water to throw on you.

36:30.087 --> 36:33.079
-And what's the syrup for?
-That's so it sticks to you.

36:39.263 --> 36:42.255
I wish you would have died
on that floor in the beach house.

36:42.366 --> 36:45.358
I went to the chapel,
and I prayed for you to die.

36:45.670 --> 36:49.470
That's the kind of horrible,
pathetic shell of a person I've become.

36:50.374 --> 36:51.773
But no more.

36:53.077 --> 36:55.102
I'm walking out that door, Dan...

36:55.313 --> 36:59.477
because if I don't,
one of us is going to die soon.

37:10.761 --> 37:11.853
What?

37:16.200 --> 37:19.135
-Lucas!
-Where's Nathan? How is he?

37:19.270 --> 37:20.396
Deb, I'm so sorry.

37:20.471 --> 37:24.430
Mrs. Scott, your son has had
severe blunt trauma to his chest...

37:24.508 --> 37:26.408
and it was caused
by a high-speed collision.

37:26.477 --> 37:29.503
His right lung has collapsed,
and he's losing a great deal of blood.

37:29.580 --> 37:30.604
Is he in surgery?

37:30.681 --> 37:33.149
We're prepping him,
but the antigen in his blood...

37:33.217 --> 37:35.447
-it's rare.
-I'm the same. I'll donate.

37:38.889 --> 37:40.516
You better pray he's okay.

37:58.943 --> 38:01.605
You ought to lock
your front door, you know.

38:01.746 --> 38:04.510
Some old crazy guy
might come in here and get you.

38:05.850 --> 38:08.182
OId crazy guys don't scare me.

38:12.023 --> 38:14.685
I know this is not really appropriate...

38:14.759 --> 38:17.455
but Jake said you wouldn't
answer the door if I knocked...

38:17.528 --> 38:19.519
so I should just walk in.

38:20.097 --> 38:22.759
-You've been to see him?
-I have.

38:26.270 --> 38:28.261
Mind if we sit down?

38:28.406 --> 38:31.398
Yeah. The bed?

38:33.344 --> 38:36.609
The PTA would have a field day with this.

38:38.816 --> 38:41.444
Have you ever been to Florida, Peyton?

38:42.520 --> 38:44.181
Once, with my dad.

38:45.690 --> 38:48.989
There's a little town
just off the Gulf of Mexico...

38:49.226 --> 38:52.593
the weather's perfect year round,
kind of like today.

38:53.631 --> 38:55.690
It's almost a paradise.

38:56.701 --> 38:59.226
It's a great place to raise a child.

38:59.470 --> 39:03.304
Or, if you're family,
to protect one till her daddy can arrive.

39:05.643 --> 39:09.670
Jenny's fine, Peyton.
Jake wanted you to know that.

39:13.517 --> 39:16.111
I went by to see him this morning...

39:17.154 --> 39:19.622
and he told me he didn't want me
to visit anymore.

39:19.957 --> 39:21.925
He said it was too hard.

39:24.562 --> 39:26.427
I can understand that.

39:28.566 --> 39:32.400
I know you miss your mom, honey,
just like I miss my wife.

39:35.906 --> 39:37.874
But think about Jake.

39:39.210 --> 39:41.701
He misses both women that he loves.

39:51.188 --> 39:53.122
-Mr. And Mrs. Scott?
-Yes.

39:53.657 --> 39:55.090
Nathan is in surgery.

39:55.259 --> 39:58.251
We were able to locate
an additional supply of his blood type.

39:58.896 --> 40:01.228
He needed more than what I gave?

40:03.367 --> 40:06.598
Mrs. Scott, how long have you
been abusing prescription drugs?

40:07.104 --> 40:09.197
I'm sorry. Your blood was unusable.

40:10.608 --> 40:11.939
Excuse me.

40:19.550 --> 40:20.710
Lucas.

40:25.055 --> 40:28.149
It's okay. I'm here for you.

40:38.469 --> 40:40.130
How long with the pills?

40:40.304 --> 40:43.569
-Since I quit my job.
-Why?

40:44.842 --> 40:46.776
Because I'm married to you.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.041
Look, man, I was just trying to help,
all right?

41:20.778 --> 41:22.405
Dan, calm down.

41:29.620 --> 41:30.985
How's your karma, Dan?

41:40.331 --> 41:41.764
He would have turned left.

41:42.166 --> 41:45.795
Nathan's an athlete.
His reflexes would have been to turn left.

41:47.505 --> 41:48.904
But he didn't.

41:51.075 --> 41:52.872
It was almost like....

41:54.178 --> 41:56.976
Like he aimed for the wall, you know?

41:58.349 --> 42:00.874
Like he tried to crash.

42:05.222 --> 42:08.419
<i>Stephen King once wrote.:</i>
<i>''Time takes it all.</i>

42:09.393 --> 42:11.156
<i>''Whether you want it to or not.</i>

42:13.831 --> 42:17.096
<i>''Time takes it all, time bears it away...</i>

42:18.302 --> 42:21.032
<i>''and in the end, there is only darkness.</i>

42:29.647 --> 42:32.138
<i>''Sometimes we find others</i>

42:39.456 --> 42:42.016
<i>''And sometimes we lose them</i>
