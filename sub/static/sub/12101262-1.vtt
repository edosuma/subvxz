01:19.997 --> 01:21.531
<i>Hello?</i>

01:22.900 --> 01:23.733
<i>Hello?</i>

01:25.002 --> 01:26.003
<i>I'm gonna hang up.</i>

01:26.037 --> 01:27.872
Tonight on NBC nightly news,

01:29.040 --> 01:30.842
you might see a familiar face.

01:30.875 --> 01:32.844
<i>Oh my God, Brandon?</i>

01:32.877 --> 01:34.544
You thought I was
gonna rot in jail

01:34.578 --> 01:36.746
for 30 goddamn stinking years?

01:36.781 --> 01:37.982
<i>Where are you?</i>

01:40.084 --> 01:41.786
Exactly where I said I'd be.

01:43.754 --> 01:44.922
You're still coming, right?

01:45.722 --> 01:46.958
<i>Of course I am.</i>

01:48.125 --> 01:49.359
Okay, then.

01:50.862 --> 01:52.529
We do this exactly like I said,

01:53.463 --> 01:54.497
I'll be waiting here.

02:41.112 --> 02:41.913
Oh God.

02:42.246 --> 02:43.180
Hey, Angie.

02:43.214 --> 02:45.850
You have no idea how
good it is to see you.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.152
Feeling's mutual, believe me.

02:48.185 --> 02:49.954
You look like shit,
little brother.

02:49.987 --> 02:51.621
Well, I feel like
a million dollars.

02:52.056 --> 02:53.024
I bet you do.

02:54.759 --> 02:55.927
I brought you some clothes,

02:55.960 --> 02:56.761
some of Jerry's...

02:56.794 --> 02:57.594
Jerry?

02:57.627 --> 02:58.829
The hell you did.

02:58.863 --> 03:01.933
Cowboy-looking motherfucker's
clothes ain't gonna suit me.

03:01.966 --> 03:06.003
It's a very generous donation
that he made involuntarily,

03:06.037 --> 03:08.172
so try not to trash the
whole damn outfit, all right?

03:09.173 --> 03:10.141
Fine, fine,

03:10.174 --> 03:11.541
I appreciate the sentiment.

03:15.179 --> 03:16.013
Damn.

03:26.023 --> 03:27.992
Your raggedy-ass self
gonna have to walk,

03:28.025 --> 03:29.160
'cause you ain't
getting in my vehicle

03:29.193 --> 03:31.228
wearing no smelly-ass
prison getup.

03:31.561 --> 03:34.131
You gonna make me
undress out in the open?

03:34.165 --> 03:36.233
Ain't nobody looking at you.

03:36.267 --> 03:38.102
Motherfucker, shit.

03:39.203 --> 03:40.271
Be quick, though,

03:40.304 --> 03:42.239
give a motherfucker
a heart attack,

03:42.273 --> 03:44.607
see you naked in the street.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.077
Haha motherfucker.

04:04.627 --> 04:05.262
Drive.

06:13.324 --> 06:14.158
Damn man.

06:26.237 --> 06:29.106
Anybody out here try
to fuck with my wheels,

06:29.140 --> 06:30.875
I'm holding you
personally responsible.

06:30.908 --> 06:32.877
Get off my back man, damn.

06:32.910 --> 06:35.279
Ain't nobody out here, Clarence,

06:35.312 --> 06:37.680
nobody been on this damn
ranch since granddaddy died.

06:37.714 --> 06:38.681
Nobody but us.

06:39.183 --> 06:40.184
Hey, Angie.

06:41.152 --> 06:43.287
You positive they won't come
looking for me out here?

06:43.854 --> 06:45.122
Not a chance in hell.

06:45.956 --> 06:47.825
We always said this was
the perfect hideout.

06:50.261 --> 06:51.962
You'll be all right.

07:28.032 --> 07:28.899
There it is.

07:30.167 --> 07:31.202
Safe haven.

07:31.802 --> 07:33.370
Brings back all them
summers we spent out here,

07:33.404 --> 07:34.405
when we were kids.

07:34.772 --> 07:36.307
Bran was too small.

07:36.340 --> 07:37.408
Nah, I remember.

07:38.142 --> 07:39.877
Well,
it's falling apart,

07:39.910 --> 07:40.844
that's for damn sure.

07:46.317 --> 07:49.753
I'd say it's an upgrade, sorta.

08:01.799 --> 08:03.000
This place got dusty,

08:04.268 --> 08:05.269
real goddamn dusty.

08:07.438 --> 08:08.339
How long, exactly,

08:08.372 --> 08:09.540
is this shit gonna take Brandon?

08:09.573 --> 08:11.242
I didn't agree to
no extended stay.

08:11.275 --> 08:12.142
Come on, man,

08:13.344 --> 08:14.411
you know how it is,

08:14.445 --> 08:17.414
my face will be in the
papers for a week, maybe two,

08:18.882 --> 08:20.417
till they find another brother

08:20.451 --> 08:22.820
to pin all of
society's problems on.

08:22.853 --> 08:24.488
Right, with all these sex cults,

08:24.521 --> 08:26.991
and blood-sucking hippies about,

08:27.024 --> 08:28.425
this shit should
blow over in no time.

08:28.459 --> 08:32.296
Y'all, we can make
tracks through Georgia,

08:32.329 --> 08:34.365
we can settle in Florida,

08:34.398 --> 08:36.066
they got this new attraction,

08:36.100 --> 08:39.303
Disney World. Disney World!

08:39.336 --> 08:40.304
It sounds good, right?

08:40.337 --> 08:42.406
Oh, Disney World,

08:42.439 --> 08:43.274
that's where I'd certainly hide,

08:43.307 --> 08:45.476
if I escaped from
the penitentiary,

08:45.509 --> 08:48.212
and was trying to
keep a low profile.

08:48.245 --> 08:49.246
Right next to Mickey.

08:49.280 --> 08:50.214
Shut the fuck up.

08:50.247 --> 08:52.216
Clarence, relax man.

08:53.050 --> 08:55.786
This shit start to
fuck with my allergies,

08:56.553 --> 08:59.089
you two's on your own!

09:04.461 --> 09:05.396
Right where I left 'em.

09:05.429 --> 09:06.263
Damn.

09:07.197 --> 09:09.033
Anybody tries to fuck with us,

09:09.066 --> 09:11.135
they're gonna have
another thing coming.

09:11.168 --> 09:12.269
They ain't
gonna have nothing coming,

09:12.303 --> 09:13.203
'cause they'll be dead, shit.

09:13.237 --> 09:14.505
Oh yeah.

09:14.538 --> 09:18.342
Nope, the idea is for
us to stay out of jail,

09:18.375 --> 09:20.477
you ain't taken the both
of us back there with you.

09:20.511 --> 09:22.346
Goddamn it,

09:22.379 --> 09:23.881
should've stashed more liquor!

09:24.515 --> 09:25.816
You can
have it all man.

09:30.454 --> 09:32.990
Oh, I'm gonna.

09:34.124 --> 09:35.392
What the...

09:35.426 --> 09:37.428
Oh, real nice,

09:37.461 --> 09:39.596
leave me with the
fucking peashooter.

09:55.412 --> 09:57.481
<i>And here's Rob
Robson with the latest.</i>

09:57.514 --> 09:58.716
<i>The state

<i>by federal civil

10:09.093 --> 10:11.328
<i>Superintendent John
Hill has stated</i>

10:11.362 --> 10:14.064
<i>that the board will not
consider another plan</i>

10:14.098 --> 10:16.567
<i>until a federal court

<i>about the board's plan</i>

10:18.435 --> 10:22.172

10:22.940 --> 10:25.976
<i>Dr. Greer told NBC education

10:26.009 --> 10:28.312
<i>that more desegregation now,</i>

10:28.345 --> 10:31.348
<i>would pose a real
political problem</i>

Oh, you sneaky

10:54.605 --> 10:57.608

<i>get your hands on a Toyota

12:31.803 --> 12:36.039
Being here, it's like
going back 10 years,

12:37.207 --> 12:38.810
back to when we were kids.

12:38.843 --> 12:39.676
Yeah.

12:40.310 --> 12:41.745
Kinda crazy, right?

12:42.780 --> 12:44.481
Simpler times for all of us.

12:45.349 --> 12:46.583
Yeah.

12:46.617 --> 12:48.585
Sometimes it's good to
get away from it, though.

12:48.953 --> 12:50.621
- Mmhmm.
- Take a moment to stop,

12:50.654 --> 12:52.556
assess where you're
at, you know?

12:52.589 --> 12:53.590
Yeah.

12:55.659 --> 12:56.660
I missed you, Bran.

12:58.695 --> 12:59.630
I miss our family.

13:01.198 --> 13:02.733
Yeah, me too.

13:02.767 --> 13:05.202
I was so scared for you,

13:05.235 --> 13:08.806
I know you didn't do those
things they said on the TV,

13:08.840 --> 13:11.475
you just got in with
the wrong crowd,

13:11.508 --> 13:12.609
we got you out now, right?

13:16.480 --> 13:17.714
You always know where I'm at,

13:19.616 --> 13:21.853
as long as you stay
out of trouble,

13:21.886 --> 13:23.287
stay out of trouble...

13:23.320 --> 13:23.855
I hear you,

13:23.888 --> 13:24.822
I hear you.

13:24.856 --> 13:26.323
You can come
stay with me and Jerry,

13:26.356 --> 13:27.724
you're always gonna be welcome.

13:28.258 --> 13:29.693
He don't mind you
being out here?

13:29.726 --> 13:31.763
Oh, he minds,

13:31.796 --> 13:34.431
I told him I was helping
Clarence for a couple of weeks.

13:34.731 --> 13:35.699
Huh.

13:35.732 --> 13:37.100
That was bad enough.

13:38.302 --> 13:39.403
If he really knew
what I was doing,

13:39.436 --> 13:40.370
he would flip out.

13:40.404 --> 13:41.806
Hmm.

13:41.839 --> 13:42.639
You two going good, though?

13:42.673 --> 13:43.607
Yeah, yeah,

13:43.640 --> 13:44.809
real good,

13:44.842 --> 13:48.178
he's buying us a
condo in Knoxville.

13:48.211 --> 13:49.313
Shit, that's cool.

13:49.346 --> 13:50.614
Yeah, yeah,

13:50.647 --> 13:52.516
so you got somebody?

13:52.549 --> 13:53.785
Where, back in prison?

13:54.752 --> 13:56.653
Nah,

13:56.687 --> 13:58.756
nah, I ain't got
nobody out here.

14:00.624 --> 14:02.192
Sure beats being in there.

14:02.225 --> 14:03.861
You've got me and Clarence,

14:03.895 --> 14:04.963
that ain't nobody.

14:04.996 --> 14:07.297
Yeah, but you two've got
things all set up, you know?

14:07.331 --> 14:08.665
You and Jerry,

14:08.699 --> 14:09.600
I ain't like that.

14:10.868 --> 14:12.369
Be like that, Bran.

14:13.805 --> 14:14.705
You busted out of jail,

14:14.738 --> 14:16.173
you're laying low,

14:17.140 --> 14:19.610
soon you're gonna have
another chance at this,

14:19.643 --> 14:21.178
so don't screw it up again.

14:22.780 --> 14:24.681
You got your whole
life ahead of you,

14:24.715 --> 14:27.651
just hanging by a thread,

14:27.684 --> 14:29.653
it's like you keep
pulling on that thread,

14:30.621 --> 14:34.358
like you're trying to
screw yourself over. Why?

14:37.227 --> 14:37.862
I don't know.

14:39.797 --> 14:41.431
Well, you got two weeks,

14:41.465 --> 14:42.599
maybe longer,

14:42.633 --> 14:43.600
to figure it out.

14:45.602 --> 14:46.670
So figure it out.

14:57.681 --> 14:59.716
Hey man,
look at your drunk ass,

15:00.818 --> 15:02.519
you was dancing, huh?

15:02.552 --> 15:06.791
So, sitting around all dusty
for the next few weeks,

15:06.824 --> 15:07.825
fun, fun, fun.

15:09.493 --> 15:10.494
I would do it for you, man.

15:10.527 --> 15:12.229
I don't know,

15:12.262 --> 15:13.898
this "on the run" bullshit,

15:13.931 --> 15:15.833
sounded way better in my head.

15:17.234 --> 15:18.402
You want one?

15:18.435 --> 15:19.403
Thanks, man.

15:29.413 --> 15:30.247
Tasty, huh?

15:38.790 --> 15:39.991
What's up, Clarence?

15:40.024 --> 15:41.893
Now, I don't wanna
know if you did,

15:41.926 --> 15:43.627
or didn't do it,

15:43.660 --> 15:45.629
I just need you to know you
ain't gonna try that shit again.

15:46.229 --> 15:48.498
A cop says something
about a kid,

15:48.532 --> 15:49.733
what happened to him?

15:49.767 --> 15:50.701
You gotta put that
behind you now,

15:50.734 --> 15:52.636
mistakes happen,
and you learn.

15:52.669 --> 15:53.737
He ain't die or nothing.

15:53.771 --> 15:55.305
I said leave it, Brandon.

15:55.338 --> 15:57.708
Fuck man, all it
was supposed to be...

15:57.741 --> 15:59.476
Hey, I said I don't
wanna know about it,

15:59.509 --> 16:00.744
you're out now,

16:00.778 --> 16:01.846
that's what matters.

16:02.046 --> 16:03.313
You get back in,

16:03.346 --> 16:04.849
you do anything like that again,

16:04.882 --> 16:07.852
you'll have your sentence
right here with me.

16:07.885 --> 16:08.753
I taught you better,

16:08.786 --> 16:09.987
that's for damn sure.

16:10.021 --> 16:11.354
Oh, quit acting
like you dad now.

16:11.388 --> 16:12.890
Oh, I ain't dad,

16:12.924 --> 16:13.825
if he was here,

16:13.858 --> 16:15.692
he'd knocked some
sense in your dumb ass,

16:15.726 --> 16:17.762
so now, you're
gonna listen to me.

16:18.595 --> 16:20.798
Angela's been through
enough shit, enough times,

16:20.832 --> 16:23.000
finally, she's in a great place,

16:23.034 --> 16:26.303
and it's all on us
now, you especially.

16:27.905 --> 16:29.774
I'm here for her more than
I am for you, remember that.

16:31.776 --> 16:32.609
Thanks brother.

16:33.878 --> 16:36.580
Jerry, he don't like me,

16:37.314 --> 16:39.516
I've done some dumb ass
things that can't be undid,

16:39.549 --> 16:40.584
I know that,

16:40.617 --> 16:41.919
but you,

16:41.953 --> 16:43.888
you can do better, man.

16:43.921 --> 16:45.288
You got yourself
a second chance,

16:45.322 --> 16:46.723
right here, right now.

16:46.758 --> 16:48.658
Do right by this family.

16:48.692 --> 16:50.627
Do something good with yourself.

16:50.660 --> 16:52.063
It's too late, man,
I fucked up.

16:52.096 --> 16:53.296
Well, we all fuck up,

16:53.330 --> 16:54.631
nobody's perfect,

16:54.664 --> 16:56.299
so nobody's gonna
take pity on you,

16:56.333 --> 16:57.634
you ain't no special case,

16:57.667 --> 16:58.903
so man the fuck up,

17:00.104 --> 17:01.471
that's all I got to say.

17:04.674 --> 17:05.509
Drink.

18:19.784 --> 18:21.618
No, let go of me,

18:21.651 --> 18:22.485
no, no,

18:24.454 --> 18:26.891
help, help!

18:34.431 --> 18:37.667
Help!

18:37.701 --> 18:39.569
No, no.

18:40.637 --> 18:41.471
No!

18:44.942 --> 18:46.710
No, stop!

18:55.987 --> 18:56.921
No, God no!

18:58.789 --> 18:59.623
No!

19:03.693 --> 19:05.963
No, please, no, no.

19:07.231 --> 19:08.065
God, no!

19:11.235 --> 19:12.669
Please God, no.

19:17.775 --> 19:18.608
Help!

19:19.676 --> 19:20.510
No, no.

19:22.646 --> 19:23.781
No!

19:23.814 --> 19:25.016
Please, let me go!

19:25.049 --> 19:26.683
No!

21:02.213 --> 21:05.216
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:05.249 --> 21:07.118
Run, run for your life,

21:07.151 --> 21:08.152
they'll kill you,

21:08.185 --> 21:09.186
and they'll eat you.

21:10.587 --> 21:11.688
They're sniffing us
out like wild dogs,

21:11.721 --> 21:14.225
and we're the goddamn meat.

21:14.258 --> 21:15.192
Hey, wait.

21:19.130 --> 21:20.164
Shit.

22:10.014 --> 22:11.115
Angie, Angie,

22:12.183 --> 22:13.284
Angie, wake up,

22:13.317 --> 22:14.852
Angie, wake up,

22:14.885 --> 22:16.020
Angie, wake up.

22:16.053 --> 22:16.987
What?

22:17.021 --> 22:18.122
We gotta go now.

22:18.155 --> 22:19.190
- Where're Clarence's keys?
- Is it the police?

22:19.223 --> 22:21.058
It ain't the damn police,
where are the car keys?

22:21.092 --> 22:22.793
I don't know, look in his bag.

22:24.128 --> 22:25.296
Where the
hell is Clarence?

22:25.329 --> 22:27.898
Asleep,
drunk, I don't know.

22:27.932 --> 22:29.066
What's wrong, Brandon?

22:29.100 --> 22:30.201
You're scaring me.

22:30.234 --> 22:32.303
Well be scared,
but just stay real quiet.

22:39.443 --> 22:41.779
What kinda hell is this?

22:42.446 --> 22:43.114
Clarence!

22:43.147 --> 22:44.181
We gotta go, come on,

22:44.215 --> 22:45.249
let's go!

22:55.192 --> 22:56.227
Who are they?

23:24.321 --> 23:27.091
Oh, shit.

23:31.262 --> 23:32.963
Come on!

23:37.935 --> 23:38.769
Brandon!

23:43.274 --> 23:45.342
Come on baby,

23:45.376 --> 23:46.510
come on, come on,
don't do this to me.

23:46.544 --> 23:48.245
- What the fuck is this?
- I don't know.

23:48.279 --> 23:50.047
What do you mean,
you don't know?

23:50.080 --> 23:52.149
Come on, come on!

24:04.295 --> 24:05.129
Get out.

24:08.165 --> 24:08.999
No.

24:10.367 --> 24:12.002
They're gonna barbecue us,

24:12.036 --> 24:12.836
Angie, let's go,

24:12.870 --> 24:13.671
come on!

24:16.240 --> 24:17.041
Angie!

24:28.552 --> 24:29.386
Come on!

25:52.936 --> 25:53.971
Clarence.

25:55.506 --> 25:57.041
Clarence.

25:58.108 --> 25:58.942
Clarence.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.435
Fuck you,

26:24.468 --> 26:26.103
fuck you, motherfucker,

26:26.136 --> 26:26.970
fuck you.

26:31.575 --> 26:34.411
Motherfucker,
where're you going?

26:41.318 --> 26:45.389
Howdy doody, thick
lips.

26:58.936 --> 27:00.337
You hear that screaming

27:00.371 --> 27:02.673
on the other side
of that wall there?

27:02.706 --> 27:03.907
That's your friend.

27:05.075 --> 27:07.411
Bubba's carving us
up some black meat.

27:08.612 --> 27:11.348
Do you know why
we eat black folk?

27:17.254 --> 27:21.358
Because Negro flesh tastes
so goddamn good.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.061
You see,

27:24.094 --> 27:27.131
you dark skins have only existed

27:27.164 --> 27:28.565
to be food for the white man.

27:29.633 --> 27:31.602
My cousin Delmar,

27:31.635 --> 27:32.503
he'll tell you,

27:32.536 --> 27:35.406
it goes way back to
the ancient times.

27:36.573 --> 27:38.976
You have always been our meat,

27:39.943 --> 27:43.046
so we're gonna take it
back to the natural way,

27:43.080 --> 27:47.184
where you're kind ain't
nothing but a food source.

27:49.186 --> 27:51.488
I said stay the hell
outta here, dammit.

28:00.464 --> 28:01.532
Tasting good, Bubba.

28:02.232 --> 28:05.335
Now go back and finish him off.

28:05.369 --> 28:07.538
Stay the hell outta here.

28:19.149 --> 28:21.652
What're you tryna do,

28:21.685 --> 28:24.054
burn the whole place down?

28:25.422 --> 28:28.158
So, you like playing with fire.

29:00.123 --> 29:03.126
Let's see how much blacker
we can get your balls.

29:14.605 --> 29:15.639
Yes, that's it.

29:21.645 --> 29:24.481
Yeah, nice and crisp.

29:25.115 --> 29:28.085
Just the way Jeb likes
his meat.

29:54.611 --> 29:56.146
Oh no you don't.

30:01.853 --> 30:03.387
No, no, no, no...

30:04.822 --> 30:06.523
Get off me, man.

30:40.858 --> 30:43.427
That feel good, motherfucker?

30:59.743 --> 31:00.744
Shit.

32:07.945 --> 32:08.780
Ah, fuck.

32:56.861 --> 32:59.329
What took you so goddamn long?

33:00.697 --> 33:01.899
What'd they do to me, Brandon?

33:02.934 --> 33:04.769
I can't feel my arm,

33:04.802 --> 33:06.303
it's numb as hell.

33:07.604 --> 33:08.973
Fuck, Clarence.

33:09.006 --> 33:10.842
Fuck them, man.

33:10.875 --> 33:12.743
- Oh shit.
- Pull yourself together,

33:12.777 --> 33:14.544
I don't
need that shit.

33:15.813 --> 33:17.647
Pass me that whisky.

33:22.754 --> 33:25.388
Fuck, where's Angela?

33:25.422 --> 33:26.590
I don't know, man.

33:26.623 --> 33:28.926
We came out here 'cause of you,

33:28.960 --> 33:30.895
so you better find her,

33:30.928 --> 33:32.029
and make sure she's all right, \.

33:32.063 --> 33:33.898
Swear it, little brother.

33:34.832 --> 33:35.800
Yeah.

33:35.833 --> 33:37.935
I don't care what it takes,

33:37.969 --> 33:41.873
you just get her off this
goddamn death ranch alive.

33:41.906 --> 33:43.740
I gotta get you to
a hospital, man.

33:43.775 --> 33:47.577
Motherfucker, we're 50 miles
away from any hospital.

33:48.846 --> 33:50.915
We're in the middle of nowhere,

33:50.948 --> 33:53.416
I'm fucking dead, man,

33:53.450 --> 33:56.586
so just leave me
here to die in peace,

33:56.620 --> 33:58.588
with my goddamn whiskey.

33:58.622 --> 34:00.357
I ain't leaving
you here, Clarence.

34:00.390 --> 34:01.826
I'm your big brother.

34:02.726 --> 34:04.594
You do what I fucking say,

34:04.628 --> 34:06.563
stop wasting time.

34:08.698 --> 34:09.834
Okay.

34:09.867 --> 34:11.668
All right.

34:11.701 --> 34:13.537
You want a cigarette
before I go?

34:13.570 --> 34:15.338
I was trying to quit.

34:17.041 --> 34:17.875
Still trying?

34:35.827 --> 34:37.995
Keep this fucking
lighter too, man,

34:38.029 --> 34:41.766
I never wanna see
that shit again.

34:41.799 --> 34:42.867
Okay.

34:42.900 --> 34:44.668
Hang on,

34:44.701 --> 34:46.703
they didn't find the guns,

34:47.704 --> 34:51.075
I put 'em back in the barrel
before we went to sleep.

34:52.009 --> 34:53.577
That was stupid.

34:53.610 --> 34:54.879
I could've saved
your dumb ass.

34:54.912 --> 34:58.381
Well, I might've
saved yours instead.

34:58.415 --> 35:01.819
Now, go and give 'em hell.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.021
I'll find Angie,

35:04.055 --> 35:05.388
and we'll come back for you.

35:09.827 --> 35:11.028
Clarence.

36:57.234 --> 36:59.103
Well, well, well,

36:59.136 --> 37:01.638
looks like I caughts me
a little black baboon.

37:02.572 --> 37:06.509
Looks like you caught
yourself a bullet.

37:25.329 --> 37:27.832
Get your sorry white ass
against that barrel.

37:29.100 --> 37:30.134
Now!

37:34.171 --> 37:37.074
Come on, move!

37:41.979 --> 37:43.546
Against the barrel.

37:55.993 --> 37:57.194
Look at me, asshole.

37:59.063 --> 38:00.765
You can't talk to me
like that, nig....

38:02.366 --> 38:04.168
I can do whatever
the fuck I want.

38:06.736 --> 38:08.239
The girl I was with,

38:08.272 --> 38:09.106
where's she at?

38:11.809 --> 38:13.778
- She's dead.
- Don't fuck with me!

38:16.247 --> 38:17.081
She's alive.

38:18.115 --> 38:19.283
She's alive!

38:19.316 --> 38:21.185
You better pray to
God she's still alive,

38:21.218 --> 38:22.753
'cause you'll be in
a whole 'nother world

38:22.787 --> 38:25.089
of suffering if
you've hurt my sister.

38:25.122 --> 38:26.623
I swear to God.

38:26.656 --> 38:27.291
Where?

38:28.359 --> 38:31.295
Sh... she's..sh...

38:31.328 --> 38:32.363
They've got her in,

38:32.396 --> 38:34.065
in the fuck pit.

38:39.804 --> 38:41.939
Go on.

38:44.141 --> 38:47.311
Some of the others don't like
eating the women right away,

38:49.180 --> 38:50.181
they like to keep 'em awhile,

38:50.214 --> 38:51.614
I don't approve of it,

38:51.648 --> 38:53.818
and they like to get
themselves a taste

38:53.851 --> 38:56.053
of that chocolate pussy.

39:00.758 --> 39:01.926
Where?

39:01.959 --> 39:05.863
Under the trap
door, in the back.

39:05.896 --> 39:06.964
Where, motherfucker?

39:06.997 --> 39:08.365
Behind the barn,

39:08.399 --> 39:09.233
it's underground.

39:12.336 --> 39:13.137
You like human meat,

39:13.170 --> 39:15.039
you sick fuck?

39:15.072 --> 39:18.008
Here, have some of your own.

39:29.787 --> 39:30.620
Eat it!

39:35.359 --> 39:36.794
Chew it up, whitey,

39:36.827 --> 39:39.196
or I'll blow your
motherfucking head off,

39:39.230 --> 39:40.231
fucking swallow
that shit down, too.

40:26.844 --> 40:28.779
Stay down!

40:36.787 --> 40:38.789
Fuck pit, huh?

41:32.343 --> 41:35.145
Oh yeah, open those legs.

41:35.179 --> 41:36.080
Yeah, good.

41:37.348 --> 41:39.250
Spread those legs.

41:39.283 --> 41:41.852
Open those legs, bitch!

41:41.885 --> 41:42.786
I'm gonna give it to you,

41:42.820 --> 41:46.056
I'm gonna give it to you good.

41:46.090 --> 41:48.225
Goddamn, Cletus,

41:48.259 --> 41:51.462
you done had your
turn a half hour ago,

41:51.495 --> 41:53.330
Joe Bob's next,

41:53.364 --> 41:54.265
get out!

41:57.234 --> 41:59.770
Unless you wanna see
how a real man does it.

42:01.238 --> 42:02.039
Well?

42:03.540 --> 42:05.376
Dumb ass.

42:05.409 --> 42:06.877
Hey, Joe Bob,

42:06.910 --> 42:07.811
hand me that goo,

42:07.845 --> 42:09.413
this bitch dun gone dry on me.

42:33.170 --> 42:34.471
No, no!

42:34.505 --> 42:36.940
Mm, that'll do me nice.

42:55.059 --> 42:56.193
What the fuck?

43:27.691 --> 43:30.127
Where're you going Joe Bob?

43:30.160 --> 43:31.562
You wouldn't wanna
miss your turn.

44:05.028 --> 44:06.663
Ah, my fucking eyes.

45:11.528 --> 45:13.096
You all right?

45:13.130 --> 45:13.964
No, no.

45:21.505 --> 45:22.539
I'm mad, Brandon.

45:24.508 --> 45:25.742
I'm really fucking mad.

45:33.183 --> 45:34.351
Clarence is dead.

45:37.421 --> 45:40.157
No , no.

45:45.128 --> 45:46.230
I couldn't save him.

45:53.437 --> 45:56.273
I got some blood
on Jerry's shirt.

45:56.941 --> 45:58.509
I'll have to owe him a new one.

46:06.083 --> 46:07.718
Was it their blood?

46:07.751 --> 46:08.652
Yeah, most of it.

46:08.685 --> 46:10.755
Then Jerry won't give a damn.

46:18.595 --> 46:20.664
Hand me that fucking gun.

46:28.305 --> 46:29.673
You got any more ammunition?

46:29.706 --> 46:30.775
Yeah, plenty more.

46:30.808 --> 46:34.745
Good, they're gonna wish
they never did this to us.

46:35.880 --> 46:37.381
You wanna go to the police?

46:37.414 --> 46:38.315
We can't.

46:38.348 --> 46:39.616
It's you that I'm worried for.

46:39.650 --> 46:41.518
I already lost one brother,

46:41.552 --> 46:43.353
I didn't go all through
all this for nothing.

46:55.432 --> 46:56.733
Let's get crazy.

47:48.752 --> 47:49.754
He in there.

47:59.429 --> 48:01.833
fuck!

48:05.970 --> 48:07.738
I gotta tell you
something, Angie.

48:10.507 --> 48:13.176
You know that crime that you
think I really didn't commit?

48:17.280 --> 48:19.917
I think I brought this whole
thing down on our heads.

48:23.253 --> 48:24.554
Can't make out no other reason

48:24.588 --> 48:25.790
for this kind of punishment,

48:27.892 --> 48:29.761
I'm sorry, but,

48:29.794 --> 48:31.294
God gonna make me serve my time,

48:31.328 --> 48:32.729
one way or the other.

48:52.549 --> 48:54.317
This ain't your fault, Brandon.

48:54.351 --> 48:55.185
Yeah?

48:56.319 --> 48:58.890
Who else we out here for, huh?

48:59.957 --> 49:00.724
Who dragged you out here?

49:00.758 --> 49:02.192
Don't you be sorry,

49:03.861 --> 49:05.295
nobody deserves this.

49:19.944 --> 49:21.445
Wait right here.

49:31.022 --> 49:35.525
Hey, how many more
of you out here?

49:36.894 --> 49:37.895
About a hundred.

49:39.063 --> 49:42.733
No, a thousand.

49:44.468 --> 49:45.368
Well, right now,

49:46.670 --> 49:47.905
looks like you're the only one.

49:47.939 --> 49:51.843
But they'll be here ,

49:51.876 --> 49:53.878
and you'll be sorry!

49:53.911 --> 49:55.512
Maybe.

49:57.514 --> 50:00.885
But they'll be
too late for you, asshole.

50:05.355 --> 50:06.924
What the fuck?

50:06.958 --> 50:07.792
Idiots!

50:10.427 --> 50:12.797
Delmar's gonna be mad
as hell about this.

50:12.830 --> 50:14.564
Gimme that, gimme that.

50:15.800 --> 50:17.701
I say we go down there,

50:17.734 --> 50:20.370
and initiate a bit
of coon control.

50:52.770 --> 50:53.570
Jeb?

50:54.504 --> 50:55.572
Bubba?

50:57.008 --> 50:57.909
Joe Bob?

51:11.889 --> 51:12.924
Holy shit!

51:30.041 --> 51:32.009
Looking for your friend?

51:43.486 --> 51:44.487
Fuck!

51:44.521 --> 51:45.122
Shit!

51:57.434 --> 51:58.568
Go get Delmar!

52:07.211 --> 52:11.949
Fuck!

52:25.695 --> 52:27.198
Shit!

52:50.955 --> 52:51.756
Ow, ow!

54:17.341 --> 54:19.076
Do it!

54:22.146 --> 54:23.147
Ow!

54:23.180 --> 54:24.081
Ah, my spine,

54:25.715 --> 54:27.218
my fucking spine!

54:29.153 --> 54:33.590
Ah, I can't feel
my legs.

54:36.060 --> 54:37.261
My fucking spine!

54:38.963 --> 54:40.697
I can't feel my legs.

54:42.233 --> 54:43.733
You feel this, sucker?

54:48.372 --> 54:50.573
Guess you did.

54:50.607 --> 54:52.843
Other one hightailed
it into the woods.

54:52.877 --> 54:53.778
Fuck!

54:53.811 --> 54:55.846
Go, I'll take care of this guy.

55:03.220 --> 55:07.590
Hmm, nothing but a
pathetic little white man.

55:07.624 --> 55:09.626
Come on, do it!

55:09.659 --> 55:11.628
I ain't afraid of no
black black bitch!

55:15.866 --> 55:17.301
What're you doing?

55:17.334 --> 55:19.036
What're you doing?

55:22.139 --> 55:22.940
What're you doing?

55:22.973 --> 55:24.008
No!

55:24.041 --> 55:24.842
This is for Clarence.

55:27.244 --> 55:28.079
Ow!

55:41.292 --> 55:42.993
I may be a black bitch,

55:43.994 --> 55:47.597
but at least I'm the black
bitch that busted your balls.

56:40.717 --> 56:42.786
Going somewhere?

57:47.484 --> 57:48.319
Come on.

58:39.536 --> 58:40.371
Fuck.

59:09.266 --> 59:10.868
We gotta move.
You grab his legs.

59:10.901 --> 59:11.502
How many of them?

59:11.535 --> 59:12.603
I don't know.

1:00:40.257 --> 1:00:42.059
What a goddamn mess.

1:00:43.961 --> 1:00:45.596
Okay, boys,

1:00:45.629 --> 1:00:47.965
I hope y'all are hungry.

1:00:47.998 --> 1:00:50.367
Let's fix this.

1:00:50.401 --> 1:00:52.503
I ain't
going in there.

1:00:52.536 --> 1:00:54.505
I said move, fucker!

1:01:09.453 --> 1:01:14.458
Angie, I want you
to know something,

1:01:16.761 --> 1:01:19.530
if we get out of this alive,

1:01:19.563 --> 1:01:22.132
I'm gonna come stay
with you and Jerry,

1:01:22.166 --> 1:01:23.600
in that condo in Knoxville,

1:01:24.468 --> 1:01:26.203
just for a little while,

1:01:27.471 --> 1:01:31.141
I'm gonna get me
a job, a real job.

1:01:34.645 --> 1:01:36.079
And, hopefully,

1:01:38.215 --> 1:01:39.516
I can meet somebody there,

1:01:40.684 --> 1:01:43.353
she's gonna be
sexy as hell, too,

1:01:44.688 --> 1:01:46.623
I'm gonna buy my own condo.

1:01:46.657 --> 1:01:49.426
You and me
can be neighbors.

1:01:50.795 --> 1:01:53.530
Have you and Jerry over
for dinner most weeks.

1:01:55.499 --> 1:01:57.568
How do you like
the sound of that?

1:01:59.570 --> 1:02:01.505
I like all that,

1:02:01.538 --> 1:02:03.173
so shoot good,

1:02:03.207 --> 1:02:04.408
and we will make it happen.

1:02:09.313 --> 1:02:11.148
I always shoot good.

1:02:15.552 --> 1:02:17.054
Jeb, Bubba!

1:02:19.791 --> 1:02:22.760
Joe Bob! Anybody?

1:02:22.794 --> 1:02:25.429
Delmar, help me!

1:02:25.462 --> 1:02:26.730
These niggers are crazy!

1:02:27.799 --> 1:02:29.500
That you, Gator?

1:02:29.533 --> 1:02:30.334
Yeah!

1:02:30.367 --> 1:02:31.602
You all right in there?

1:02:31.635 --> 1:02:34.505
No, they ripped my
goddamn nuts off!

1:02:34.538 --> 1:02:36.039
You tell them,

1:02:36.073 --> 1:02:37.107
if they come in here,

1:02:37.976 --> 1:02:40.043
I'll blow their
motherfucking heads off.

1:02:40.611 --> 1:02:42.679
Your might wanna
keep your distance.

1:02:42.713 --> 1:02:43.547
Shit!

1:02:43.580 --> 1:02:45.516
How many of 'em?

1:02:45.549 --> 1:02:47.451
Two, and they got guns...

1:02:47.484 --> 1:02:49.086
Shut the fuck up!

1:02:53.724 --> 1:02:55.259
Ah,

1:02:55.292 --> 1:02:57.561
everything's gonna
be okay, Gator.

1:02:57.594 --> 1:03:01.231
All I gotta do is talk
to these miscreants.

1:03:02.165 --> 1:03:04.535
See if we can get you
out of there alive.

1:03:06.570 --> 1:03:09.039
- Nigger...
- Hey, you piece of shit,

1:03:10.775 --> 1:03:11.742
my name is Brandon,

1:03:12.476 --> 1:03:14.411
and that's what I'll answer to.

1:03:15.746 --> 1:03:16.580
Nigger Brandon,

1:03:17.514 --> 1:03:19.416
you're gonna come out of
there with Gator alive,

1:03:19.449 --> 1:03:20.818
and surrender yourselves. Else?

1:03:21.685 --> 1:03:25.622
We're gonna burn this barn
to the goddamn ground,

1:03:25.656 --> 1:03:26.657
with you in it!

1:03:26.690 --> 1:03:28.158
Like hell you will.

1:03:28.191 --> 1:03:30.294
You've had your fun,

1:03:30.327 --> 1:03:31.662
but you're outnumbered now.

1:03:32.563 --> 1:03:33.865
Even if you got out of this,

1:03:33.898 --> 1:03:35.732
you're just two
dumb black folks,

1:03:35.767 --> 1:03:37.802
nobody gives a damn about.

1:03:39.202 --> 1:03:42.339
Hell, no one's gonna
believe your story.

1:03:42.372 --> 1:03:43.574
You're gonna let us go?

1:03:43.607 --> 1:03:46.811
Look, no one wants to
be out here dealing

1:03:46.844 --> 1:03:50.213
with a couple of kill-crazy
niggers-on-a-rampage,

1:03:50.247 --> 1:03:51.615
on their Sunday afternoons.

1:03:52.382 --> 1:03:54.418
You know that,

1:03:54.451 --> 1:03:55.319
we know it.

1:03:56.153 --> 1:04:00.223
So, if you let little Gator
out of there unharmed,

1:04:00.257 --> 1:04:02.626
well, alive,

1:04:02.659 --> 1:04:05.262
we're gonna take it real
easy on you darkies,

1:04:06.330 --> 1:04:07.899
hang you up on a tree branch,

1:04:07.932 --> 1:04:10.734
let you go real nice
and peaceful like.

1:04:11.468 --> 1:04:13.771
Hell, I'll maybe
even say a prayer.

1:04:14.605 --> 1:04:16.774
A short one.

1:04:20.410 --> 1:04:23.513
Or, you piss us off anymore,

1:04:23.547 --> 1:04:26.283
there's gonna be a lifetime
of torture for you,

1:04:26.316 --> 1:04:30.420
oh, we can keep you
alive for weeks,

1:04:30.454 --> 1:04:31.722
make you feel agony in parts

1:04:31.756 --> 1:04:34.458
of your body you didn't
even know you had.

1:04:35.592 --> 1:04:37.594
So what do you say,
Nigger Brandon?

1:04:37.628 --> 1:04:39.730
You gonna like
Gator out of there,

1:04:39.764 --> 1:04:43.734
or are we gonna have to lock
you down in the fuck pit,

1:04:43.768 --> 1:04:46.670
let Big Willy have his way
with you for a couple of weeks?

1:04:48.338 --> 1:04:50.307
Come on, motherfuckers.

1:04:50.340 --> 1:04:51.174
Well, now?

1:04:54.611 --> 1:04:59.616
We gave 'em
fair warning. Do it!

1:05:07.759 --> 1:05:10.661
Motherfucker!

1:05:58.843 --> 1:06:00.377
Go on, get in there.

1:06:00.410 --> 1:06:01.946
Delmar, you
fucking asshole.

1:06:15.960 --> 1:06:18.328
Go get inside that room!

1:06:19.797 --> 1:06:20.832
Move!

1:06:45.923 --> 1:06:50.928
Angie!

1:06:51.863 --> 1:06:53.296
Fuck!

1:06:53.330 --> 1:06:58.335
Go, go!

1:06:59.369 --> 1:07:00.004
Jesus!

1:07:30.902 --> 1:07:33.871
Surprise mother...

1:07:33.905 --> 1:07:36.373
Get the fuck outta there.

1:07:46.818 --> 1:07:50.654
Hey, come on.

1:07:50.687 --> 1:07:51.688
We gotta go.

1:09:07.865 --> 1:09:09.532
Fuck, stop,

1:09:09.566 --> 1:09:10.400
just stop.

1:09:12.169 --> 1:09:14.005
Shit, Bran,

1:09:14.038 --> 1:09:16.506
we can't stop.

1:09:16.539 --> 1:09:18.441
You gotta get outta here,

1:09:18.475 --> 1:09:19.709
you gotta run.

1:09:19.743 --> 1:09:20.543
No.

1:09:20.577 --> 1:09:22.046
When he finds me,

1:09:22.079 --> 1:09:23.915
I'll put a bullet
right between his eyes,

1:09:25.049 --> 1:09:26.784
but I don't want
you getting killed.

1:09:26.817 --> 1:09:27.450
Brandon!

1:09:27.484 --> 1:09:28.585
Not for me!

1:09:30.955 --> 1:09:32.056
I'll slow you down.

1:09:34.759 --> 1:09:35.927
You gotta go get help...

1:09:37.762 --> 1:09:40.463
from somebody, anybody.

1:09:41.564 --> 1:09:42.666
I'm not going on without you...

1:09:42.699 --> 1:09:43.533
Angie!

1:09:45.136 --> 1:09:45.937
I can't.

1:09:48.538 --> 1:09:49.439
You gotta save me.

1:09:51.675 --> 1:09:52.676
It's on you.

1:09:54.511 --> 1:09:55.612
It's all on you.

1:09:55.645 --> 1:09:56.646
Brandon...

1:09:58.983 --> 1:09:59.984
Next time,

1:10:03.020 --> 1:10:07.959
be sure to check the damn place
out a little more closely,

1:10:08.625 --> 1:10:10.627
before you choose
it as a hideout.

1:10:17.234 --> 1:10:18.069
Go.

1:10:21.872 --> 1:10:23.174
- Go.
- No.

1:10:34.684 --> 1:10:36.053
Run Angie, run!

1:10:37.989 --> 1:10:39.090
Where are you, niggers?

1:10:47.198 --> 1:10:50.167
Shit.

1:11:02.213 --> 1:11:03.680
Well, well.

1:11:17.962 --> 1:11:20.197
You killed my clan.

1:11:20.231 --> 1:11:22.665
I don't know how you've done it,

1:11:22.699 --> 1:11:25.036
but you sure are
gonna suffer for it.

1:11:26.871 --> 1:11:28.873
I'll tell you how I done it,

1:11:28.906 --> 1:11:31.674
'cause y'all are
the dumbest cunts

1:11:31.708 --> 1:11:33.543
in the whole of
American history.

1:11:35.913 --> 1:11:39.884
Boy, I'm gonna enjoy
making you bleed.
