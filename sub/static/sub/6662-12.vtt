My name is Bridget.

00:06.923 --> 00:08.466
I witnessed a murder.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.844
Just get up on the stand and
tell the judge what you saw,

00:10.885 --> 00:12.178
and we'll protect you.

00:12.220 --> 00:14.139
BRIDGET:
I know Jimmy's got my back.

00:14.180 --> 00:16.307
I thought I'd be safe.
Turns out, I was wrong.

JIMMY:
You testify against him
tomorrow, you're dead.

00:18.435 --> 00:19.811
You need protection,

00:19.853 --> 00:21.855
and I need to explain
how you got away.

BRIDGET:
I ran to my sister
Siobhan for help.

00:25.191 --> 00:27.068
Siobhan? Siobhan!

00:27.110 --> 00:30.280
BRIDGET: Siobhan killed herself,
and I assumed her identity.

00:30.321 --> 00:31.406
It was so easy.

00:31.448 --> 00:33.366
I saw a way out, and I took it.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.035
They all think that I'm her.

00:35.076 --> 00:36.619

00:43.043 --> 00:46.755
You know what they call guys
who put down bulls? Matadors.

00:46.796 --> 00:48.423
You got a lot of
questions to answer.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.341
You still haven't told your
parents about Mr. Carpenter?

00:50.383 --> 00:51.926
Did something happen

00:51.968 --> 00:53.261

00:57.849 --> 00:59.392
Henry, I love you.

00:59.434 --> 01:01.061
Tell me, who the hell are you?

01:04.397 --> 01:05.940
You've reached
Professor Malcolm Ward.

01:05.982 --> 01:07.400
Please leave a message
at the tone.

01:07.442 --> 01:09.069
Hey, Malcolm, it's Bridget.

01:09.110 --> 01:12.197
I hope you're having a good time
at your cousin's.

01:12.238 --> 01:15.825
I, uh, heard you took
the job at Martin/Charles.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.036
I'm really glad
that you're staying.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.873
And, hey, the pizza's
way better here than in Wyoming.

that we found at Charlie's...

The Hotel Pivoine
in Boston is closed.

01:32.759 --> 01:36.679
But there is one in Paris,
so maybe Siobhan stayed there?

I just want
to figure this all out

01:40.767 --> 01:43.812

01:43.853 --> 01:47.023
I feel like
Juliet really needs me.

01:47.065 --> 01:50.235
It's been a tough few days.

01:50.276 --> 01:52.570
What the hell is
going on, Siobhan?!

01:52.612 --> 01:55.115
I know it doesn't make sense,
but I did it for us.

01:55.156 --> 01:56.741
You did what for us?

01:56.783 --> 01:59.244
I ended the relationship
to protect us.

01:59.285 --> 02:00.245
You think Gemma was
the only one

02:00.286 --> 02:02.038
who was getting suspicious?

02:02.080 --> 02:03.123
Andrew was, too.

02:03.164 --> 02:04.499
He had me followed.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.000
If I didn't do something...

02:06.042 --> 02:07.752
he was gonna
figure it out, OK?

02:07.794 --> 02:09.629
I did it to keep us safe.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.965
I don't even know what to say.

02:12.006 --> 02:13.675
Other than
I guess it worked.

loving you.

02:18.930 --> 02:20.598
Not for a second.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.351
Then why didn't
you just tell me?

02:23.393 --> 02:26.062
Because you never
would have agreed.

02:26.104 --> 02:28.565
It had to seem real.

02:28.606 --> 02:29.566
What? What's changed?

02:29.607 --> 02:32.652
Why are you telling me now?

02:32.694 --> 02:35.947
I can't stand lying to you.

apart from you.

Your little word jumbles
for The Cloisters

where we were.

what is going on, Siobhan.

finally had a sense of closure,

11:06.916 --> 11:09.293
I don't seem to have a record
of your stay here.

11:09.335 --> 11:10.378
Could you have made
the reservation

11:10.419 --> 11:11.671
under your husband's name?

11:11.712 --> 11:13.172
I don't think so.

11:13.214 --> 11:15.383
Um, it's Andrew Martin.

11:15.424 --> 11:16.926
[typing]
<b></b>
I'm sorry.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.969
Nothing under that name, either.

11:19.011 --> 11:20.262
Are you sure
it was Hotel Pivoine?

11:22.598 --> 11:23.683
You never use your real name

11:23.724 --> 11:26.268
when scheduling
your appointments.

11:26.310 --> 11:27.978
Cora.

11:28.020 --> 11:31.148
Cora Farrell.

11:31.190 --> 11:34.443
Um, could you please transfer me
to the concierge?

11:34.485 --> 11:37.196
Absolutely. Please hold
the line a moment.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.614
Donnez-moi...

11:38.656 --> 11:40.241
[phone ringing]

11:40.282 --> 11:41.742
Concierge.

11:41.784 --> 11:44.078
Hi. Uh, yes.
I was a guest at your hotel,

11:44.120 --> 11:47.665
and, uh, I think I might have
left my makeup bag there.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.334
I was wondering if you could
check the lost-and-found?

11:50.376 --> 11:52.294
Your name, please?

11:52.336 --> 11:54.213
Cora Farrell.

11:54.255 --> 11:55.798
Ah, yes, Mademoiselle Farrell.

11:55.840 --> 11:58.134
What color was the bag?

11:58.175 --> 11:59.343
Light blue.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.886
One moment.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.513
I'm sorry.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.974
There's nothing here
that looks like a makeup bag.

12:05.015 --> 12:08.728
Perhaps you left it in a taxi,
or the gentleman has it?

12:08.769 --> 12:09.937
The gentleman?

12:09.979 --> 12:10.980
Oui, mademoiselle.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.899
Your friend.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.151
I'll-I'll ask him.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.777
Uh, one last thing.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.363
I was wondering if you could
give me the dates of the stay.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.657
Maybe that would help me
figure out where I left the bag.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.075
Of course.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.745
I just need the credit card
on your reservation.

12:25.786 --> 12:28.330
You know, I don't have my wallet
on me at the moment.

12:28.372 --> 12:29.874
Uh, you remember me, right?

12:29.915 --> 12:30.875
Certainly.

12:30.916 --> 12:32.418
But the way our system works is,

12:32.460 --> 12:35.254
I cannot access a reservation
without the credit card.

12:35.296 --> 12:36.547
When you find your wallet,

12:36.589 --> 12:39.550
I'll be more than happy
to assist you.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.677
Great. Thank you.

on the inside, Jimmy? You OK?

13:10.331 --> 13:12.500
[sighs]

13:12.541 --> 13:13.667
Taken up any, uh,

13:13.709 --> 13:15.836
hobbies,
or made any new friends?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.590
Maybe he's found God.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.842
Is that it, Jimmy?
Are you looking for your savior?

13:21.884 --> 13:23.177
'Cause, you know, I can be that.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.470
I mean, all you
have to do is just

13:24.512 --> 13:25.805
tell me some stuff
about your pal

13:25.846 --> 13:27.848
Bodaway Macawi, like,

13:27.890 --> 13:31.060
how he murdered my two CIs.

13:31.101 --> 13:33.938
Hmm? I'll even give you
another chance to fill me in

13:33.979 --> 13:35.272
on what happened
with Bridget

13:35.314 --> 13:36.273
the night she ran.

13:36.315 --> 13:38.776
How about that?

13:38.818 --> 13:41.612
Suddenly, you're looking
at a reduced sentence.

13:41.654 --> 13:44.073
That's right.

13:44.114 --> 13:48.786
Maybe even transferred
to a new and improved FCI. Hmm?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.329
Be a country club
compared to this place.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.708
You that desperate, Vic?

13:54.750 --> 13:55.876
Excuse me?
I thought

13:55.918 --> 13:58.170
you were hot on Kelly's trail.

13:58.212 --> 14:00.464
Almost found her
in New York.

14:00.506 --> 14:04.510
But now, here you are,
visiting me in the joint.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.679
Offering me a vacation...
if I'll spill.

14:09.473 --> 14:12.309
You're getting nowhere
with Bridget.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.644
You're no closer
to Bodaway Macawi

14:13.686 --> 14:15.771
than you were 6 months ago.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.108
It's...pathetic.

14:19.149 --> 14:21.235
Offer's good, Jimmy.
You should take it.

14:21.277 --> 14:23.529
I think I'll pass.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.030
OK, fine.

14:25.072 --> 14:27.074
Then I guess we'll see
how long you can hold out.

14:27.116 --> 14:29.827
Bodaway's got you
on his payroll.

14:29.869 --> 14:33.581
Maybe he's got some other pals
in here, too.

14:33.622 --> 14:35.833
Think they might
make sure Detective
Kemper keeps quiet?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.002
Oh, I think they might.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.920
I'd be practicing my Kegels
if I were you, handsome.

Hey, Claudine.
It's Siobhan.

14:55.936 --> 14:57.313
Hi, Mrs. Martin.

14:57.354 --> 14:58.898
Mr. Martin's on
a conference call right now.

14:58.939 --> 15:00.024
Would you like
to leave a message?

15:00.065 --> 15:01.400
Actually, I'm looking for you.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.985
I was wondering
if you could give me the dates

15:03.027 --> 15:05.446
of the last time
we were in Paris.

15:05.487 --> 15:06.488
Just a moment.

15:10.492 --> 15:12.620
I have no record
of you going to Paris

15:12.661 --> 15:14.997
with or without Mr. Martin.

15:15.039 --> 15:16.665
But if you're joining him
on the trip in a few weeks,

15:16.707 --> 15:18.667
I'd be happy to make
the arrangements for you.

15:18.709 --> 15:20.294
Oh, he's going in a few weeks?

15:20.336 --> 15:21.587
To meet with the new

15:21.629 --> 15:24.340
Head of European Operations,
Tyler Barrett.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.634
[laughs]
Why does that name
sound familiar?

15:26.675 --> 15:27.801
You and your husband
went to dinner

15:27.843 --> 15:29.428
with Mr. Barrett
when he was in town.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.680
Before the holidays.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.475
Tyler, I'd like you
to meet my wife.

15:34.516 --> 15:37.227
Your...wife?

15:37.269 --> 15:39.605
Hi. I'm Siobhan Martin.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.858
Is that why you told me
your name was Cora?

15:42.900 --> 15:43.984
You know, would you mind

15:44.026 --> 15:45.694
connecting me
to the Paris office?

15:45.736 --> 15:47.613
Sure.

15:47.655 --> 15:48.614

15:51.158 --> 15:53.535
Tyler Barrett.

15:53.577 --> 15:55.162
Tyler, it's Siobhan.

15:55.204 --> 15:56.705
Why are you calling me here?

15:56.747 --> 15:59.667
I thought we agreed never
to talk on the office phone.

15:59.708 --> 16:00.960
Is everything all right?

16:01.001 --> 16:03.754
Yeah. Fine. I...

16:03.796 --> 16:05.464
I was just...wondering

16:05.506 --> 16:07.549
if you're still mad at me?

16:07.591 --> 16:11.637
I was never mad.
I was just...concerned.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.639
Did you get in touch
with your guy?

16:13.681 --> 16:15.474
My guy?

16:15.516 --> 16:17.935
Yeah. Solomon, right?

16:17.977 --> 16:18.936
Solomon.

16:21.438 --> 16:23.357
Solomon.

16:23.399 --> 16:24.650
OK, what's going on?

16:24.692 --> 16:26.694
It sounds
like something's wrong.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.112
ANDREW:
Siobhan?
Siobhan?

16:28.153 --> 16:30.155
I got to go.

[phone beeps off]

Hey. I thought you were
meeting with the attorney.

16:34.201 --> 16:35.661
[sighs]

16:35.703 --> 16:38.789
Did you sell the ring
that I gave you to a pawnshop?

16:38.831 --> 16:40.290
No!

16:40.332 --> 16:41.792
Why would you ask me that?

16:41.834 --> 16:43.836
[sighs]
Our jeweler called.

16:43.877 --> 16:47.214
A pawnbroker in Queens found the
serial number on the diamond,

16:47.256 --> 16:50.175
and they tried
to sell it back to them.

16:50.217 --> 16:52.469
It must have been stolen.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.596
Well, I thought you said
you were getting it resized.

16:57.433 --> 16:59.268
I lied.

16:59.309 --> 17:00.394
[both sigh]

17:00.436 --> 17:01.395
Why on earth...?

17:01.437 --> 17:03.147
Andrew, I'm so sorry.

17:03.188 --> 17:05.024
I couldn't find it, and it was
right before the party,

17:05.065 --> 17:06.275
and I panicked.

17:06.316 --> 17:08.360
I-I just kept thinking
it would turn up.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.945
I looked everywhere.

17:09.987 --> 17:14.158
I even had a plumber come
and snake the bathroom drain.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.367
Oh, Siobhan,
if you'd told me,

17:15.409 --> 17:16.952
I could have filed
an insurance claim.

17:19.413 --> 17:22.624
I didn't even think
about that. I...

17:22.666 --> 17:24.376
Andrew, I'm so sorry.

17:24.418 --> 17:25.919
That ring--it's

17:25.961 --> 17:27.838
the most amazing gift
anyone has ever given me.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.549
I...couldn't bear the thought
that I lost it.

17:34.636 --> 17:36.346
Well...

17:36.388 --> 17:38.807
if you didn't sell it to them,
who did?

Hello?

17:50.736 --> 17:53.322
This is better.

What's better?

17:54.406 --> 17:55.616
Talking on my cell.

17:55.657 --> 17:57.993
Why did you call
my office phone, anyway?

17:58.035 --> 17:59.453
I didn't.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.288
Uh, you just did.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.748
Like, two seconds ago.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.042
You sounded weird,
then hung up.

18:05.084 --> 18:06.794
From a New York number?

18:06.835 --> 18:07.961
It was a 2-1-2 area code.

This is a problem.

How do you like my new office?

18:32.111 --> 18:34.029
I didn't get a chance
to clean it yet, but, uh...

18:34.071 --> 18:36.490
It's lovely.
[laughs]
Yeah.

18:36.532 --> 18:37.866
Do you have the passport?

18:37.908 --> 18:38.992
French visa's inside.

18:47.251 --> 18:49.878
This isn't gonna work.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.088
It's exactly what
you asked for.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.006
Now I'm asking
for something else.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.967
I need "Rebecca Sheldrake."

18:55.008 --> 18:56.718
I do it twice,
you have to pay me twice.

18:56.760 --> 18:59.221
Fine. You'll get your money
when I get my papers.

19:03.267 --> 19:04.893
"Rebecca Sheldrake."

19:04.935 --> 19:06.770
Expect to hear
from you in two days.

a case against Carpenter

19:44.057 --> 19:45.976
is going to be a lot harder
than we thought?

19:46.018 --> 19:48.270
I'm not sure I should
even be showing you this,

19:48.312 --> 19:50.772
but from one parent
to another, I thought
it might change

19:50.814 --> 19:54.234
the way you handle
the situation.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.945
A lot of schools in New York
keep video surveillance

19:58.780 --> 20:00.407
When our security
team found this,

they turned it over to
the police right away.

You tried to do
him right there

in the hallway?

21:11.395 --> 21:12.562
He is your teacher,

not the captain
of the football team.

Why don't I show you out?

I made a mistake,
but then he hit on me.

I told him no, Mom.
I said, no.

I didn't want him
to be my first, but

21:21.863 --> 21:23.615

he wouldn't stop.

keeps flying!

I don't think that's
the issue, Catherine.

What's important is that we
figure out what to do now.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.420
It's going to be a lot
harder to get an indictment.

21:36.461 --> 21:37.879
It's Juliet's
word against his.

21:37.921 --> 21:39.881
There's no physical
evidence, no witnesses.

21:39.923 --> 21:43.051
Only a video that says that
Juliet was hot for teacher.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.886
You want to know
what I think happened?

21:44.928 --> 21:47.097
When Carpenter wouldn't
let you jump his bones,

21:47.139 --> 21:49.933
you decided to screw him
the only way you could.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.101
There was

21:51.143 --> 21:54.104
no sexual assault,
was there, Juliet?

21:54.146 --> 21:55.355
[crying]:
Daddy, you believe me, right?

21:55.397 --> 21:56.857
I do, sweetheart,
but it's just not

21:56.898 --> 21:58.483
that black and white anymore.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.444
Thanks for supporting me, then.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.487
And thanks for coming
to visit, Mom.

22:02.529 --> 22:04.614
You really know how to bring
a family together.

22:06.950 --> 22:07.951
Juliet, wait.

22:07.993 --> 22:08.952
Oh, where the hell
do you think

22:08.994 --> 22:09.953
you're going?
Excuse me?

22:09.995 --> 22:10.954
Oh, you're as much

22:10.996 --> 22:12.581
to blame for this as she is.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.333
You're the one that taught her
that putting out in life

22:14.374 --> 22:16.126
is how you get what you want.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.544
What the hell did
you just say to me?

22:17.586 --> 22:18.712
Oh, stop it, you two.

22:18.754 --> 22:20.255
You know, you can wear lipstick,

22:20.297 --> 22:22.007
but you are still
a husband-stealing pig.

22:22.049 --> 22:23.508
Oh, screw you, bitch!

22:23.550 --> 22:25.677
You drove him away
and you know it.

22:25.719 --> 22:27.137
Juliet's biggest problem
in life

22:27.179 --> 22:29.890
is suffering through
with your pathetic DNA.

22:29.931 --> 22:31.683
Enough!
Every time

22:31.725 --> 22:33.602
you two get together,
it's combustible!

22:33.643 --> 22:35.395
You've got to get
over it, Catherine.

22:35.437 --> 22:36.730
Siobhan didn't steal me
away from you.

22:36.772 --> 22:38.023

22:38.065 --> 22:40.984
OK, and this isn't
about the 3 of us.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.778
It's about our daughter,

22:42.819 --> 22:45.322
and she's got some serious
problems right now.

22:45.364 --> 22:47.407
And she's not just a
teenager acting out either.

22:47.449 --> 22:50.911
I'm done pretending that she's
just going through a phase.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.954
I'm going to go
and talk to her.

it out as much as you want.

the gnocchi all day.

23:29.324 --> 23:31.159
Why did you kill Gemma?

23:35.330 --> 23:36.498
Why would you say that?

23:36.540 --> 23:40.544
Because I know you
did it, Bridget.

23:40.585 --> 23:41.711
I just
don't know why.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.046
If it was money
that you wanted...

23:43.088 --> 23:44.965
I'm Siobhan.
Stop.

23:45.006 --> 23:48.093
I know the truth; I have
been following you all day.

23:48.135 --> 23:49.636
I saw you sell
Siobhan's ring

23:49.678 --> 23:52.305
and I'm sure that's
when you stole that scarf.

23:52.347 --> 23:54.224
And then later you
met a man in an alley

23:54.266 --> 23:55.767
and you tried to buy
a fake passport,

23:55.809 --> 23:58.019
probably to get the
heck out of town.

23:58.061 --> 23:59.104
You have it all wrong.

23:59.146 --> 24:00.230

24:00.272 --> 24:01.565
How about
yesterday morning?

24:01.606 --> 24:03.984

that word jumble.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.110
I forgot.

24:05.152 --> 24:06.361
And then when
I mentioned

24:06.403 --> 24:08.697
the miscarriage, you
were in total shock.

24:08.738 --> 24:11.199
I mean, do you
even know that your
sister was pregnant?

24:11.241 --> 24:12.576
Henry, I can explain
all of this.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.119
It's why I asked you to meet me.

24:16.788 --> 24:19.082

25:02.959 --> 25:05.837

25:05.879 --> 25:07.464
May I leave now?
No.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.299
Not so fast.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.426
I didn't fly all the way
from Colorado just for this.

25:11.468 --> 25:12.594
I have a few questions.

25:14.429 --> 25:15.805
Why would Henry Butler
want me to think

25:15.847 --> 25:17.599
that you're Bridget Kelly?

25:17.641 --> 25:20.519
I don't know.
He's angry.

25:20.560 --> 25:22.437
Maybe he needed
somebody to blame.

25:22.479 --> 25:25.232
Or maybe he knows you're a
friend of John Delario's,

25:25.273 --> 25:27.317
also known as
Charlie Young?

25:27.359 --> 25:28.610
I have a witness
who put you together

25:28.652 --> 25:30.487
in the Hamptons last spring.

25:30.529 --> 25:34.658
Are you talking about Tipton's
Reef on Montauk Highway?

He was
a private investigator.

25:37.536 --> 25:39.913
My sister and I had been
estranged for 6 years.

25:39.955 --> 25:41.623
No, I know that part--
you already told me.

25:44.251 --> 25:48.964
I hired him to find out
what happened to my sister,

25:49.005 --> 25:50.173
but he told me
all he kept

25:50.215 --> 25:52.926
coming up against
were dead ends.

25:52.968 --> 25:54.636
I feel like I've answered
all of your questions.

25:54.678 --> 25:57.055
Yeah, just one more.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.139
Who's Cora Farrell?

26:00.809 --> 26:02.185
Beats me.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.230
Maybe an alias
my sister used?

26:05.272 --> 26:06.856
Then why were you

26:06.898 --> 26:10.151
in an alley today holding a
passport with her alias on it?

26:14.698 --> 26:19.369
The only thing John Delario
ever got me was a number.

26:19.411 --> 26:22.998
I called it, hoping
it might help me find Bridget.

26:23.039 --> 26:27.043
The guy asked if I still
needed "the passport,"

26:27.085 --> 26:29.588
so I met him,
hoping it would help,

26:29.629 --> 26:30.839
but in the alley today,

26:30.880 --> 26:34.384
he was absolutely no help.

26:34.426 --> 26:36.177
So, that's all I know.

26:39.889 --> 26:41.683
Now may I leave?

They're saying there's no case
against Carpenter.

27:05.957 --> 27:07.417
But you still think
he did it, don't you?

27:09.669 --> 27:12.380
Between you and me, I don't know
what to think anymore.

27:14.549 --> 27:17.844
Andrew, I'm sorry about
what happened with Catherine.

27:17.886 --> 27:21.931
The last thing I want is to make
anything more difficult for you.

27:21.973 --> 27:23.516
Look, you have every right
to defend yourself.

She's the one

27:24.643 --> 27:27.854

around here.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.690
And I'm so sorry
about the ring.

27:30.732 --> 27:34.736
I should have just told you
the second I couldn't find it.

27:34.778 --> 27:37.113
I just have no idea who
would have taken it.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.991
Well, I thought it was
Juliet, but I was wrong.

27:40.033 --> 27:41.868
Regardless,
it won't happen again.

32:28.404 --> 32:30.448
So, what, I,
I can come home now?

32:30.490 --> 32:32.992
I can just leave this mess here
to the local guys.

32:33.034 --> 32:34.619
Get on the next plane.

32:34.661 --> 32:36.120
We got a signed confession
for the murders

32:36.162 --> 32:38.873
of Shaylene Briggs
and Mary Curtis.

32:38.915 --> 32:40.166
From Bodaway Macawi?

32:40.208 --> 32:42.335
No, from Jimmy Kemper.

32:42.377 --> 32:45.213
He admitted everything.

32:45.254 --> 32:47.966
Hey, Vic, pour yourself
a drink, all right?

32:48.007 --> 32:49.842
You got what you wanted.

32:49.884 --> 32:52.595
I'm having this piece of crap
transferred in the morning.

32:52.637 --> 32:54.681
W-W-W-W-Wait, n-not so fast.

32:54.722 --> 32:56.307
Bridget Kelly witnessed
the Briggs murder.

32:56.349 --> 32:58.643
She never said a word
about Jimmy Kemper.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.603
Kemper gave us details that
matched Kelly's witness report.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.522
All right, come on, Vic,

33:02.563 --> 33:06.651
guy's not going to lie to say he
killed two people if he didn't.

33:06.693 --> 33:08.236
He is
if he's protecting someone.

33:13.825 --> 33:14.867
[elevator bell dings]

33:18.746 --> 33:20.498
I want to see Juliet.

33:20.540 --> 33:22.500
[sighs]

33:22.542 --> 33:24.627
Her father took her out
for breakfast this morning.

33:24.669 --> 33:27.296
So, I don't get to say
good-bye to my own daughter.

33:27.338 --> 33:28.589
Hm, what a jerk.

33:33.177 --> 33:34.470
I think it's best we avoid

33:34.512 --> 33:36.180
any more confrontations,
don't you think?

33:38.182 --> 33:40.935
Juliet wanted you
to have this.

33:40.977 --> 33:43.062
She's never written
me a note in her life.

33:43.104 --> 33:44.856
You make her do this?

33:44.897 --> 33:46.024
I had nothing
to do with it.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.025
I remember the notes

33:47.066 --> 33:48.568
you used to leave Andrew

33:48.609 --> 33:51.112
when the two of you were
screwing during our marriage.

33:51.154 --> 33:52.196
Oh, don't act so surprised.

33:52.238 --> 33:53.281
Of course I found them.

33:53.322 --> 33:54.824
And who could
forget the little

33:54.866 --> 33:57.744
word tricks you would use
for your sexual rendezvous.

33:57.785 --> 33:59.120
Word tricks?
Yeah,

33:59.162 --> 34:00.788
the way that you would
rearrange the letters

34:00.830 --> 34:02.623
for the places
that you'd meet.

34:02.665 --> 34:04.709
Like Lucy's Cafe
would be Yucc's Leaf

34:04.751 --> 34:07.420
or something stupid
like that.

34:07.462 --> 34:09.505
TYLER: Did you get
in touch with your guy?

34:09.547 --> 34:11.007
My guy?

34:11.049 --> 34:13.217
Yeah, Solomon, right?

34:13.259 --> 34:16.846
Solomon...

34:16.888 --> 34:20.892
My sister and I used to do
word jumbles when we were kids.

34:20.933 --> 34:22.727
Did you sleep with her
husband behind her back, too?

34:27.440 --> 34:28.691
No word tricks here.

34:28.733 --> 34:29.817
[elevator bell dings]

34:34.947 --> 34:35.990
Good luck, Catherine.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.412
You know what, Siobhan?

34:41.454 --> 34:42.663
You can suck it.

35:14.904 --> 35:16.280
[sighs]

35:16.322 --> 35:17.365
Solomon.

35:24.163 --> 35:27.542
[line ringing]

35:27.583 --> 35:29.085
This is Vesida.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.254
Solomon Vesida?

35:31.295 --> 35:33.756
Yeah, who's this?

35:33.798 --> 35:35.258
Cora Farrell.

35:35.299 --> 35:36.467
Hello, Miss Farrell.

35:36.509 --> 35:37.718
It's been a while.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.262
What can I do for you?

35:39.303 --> 35:40.972
The usual.

35:41.013 --> 35:41.973
I'll pick you up in an hour.

35:46.727 --> 35:48.229
[buzzer sounds]

35:50.815 --> 35:52.900
Hello?

35:52.942 --> 35:54.360
What are you trying to pull?

35:54.402 --> 35:55.361
Hey, Vic.

35:55.403 --> 35:56.779
You find Bridget yet?

35:56.821 --> 35:57.864
Cut the crap, Kemper.

35:57.905 --> 35:59.532
You didn't kill my CIs.

35:59.574 --> 36:01.367
You're protecting
Bodaway Macawi.

36:01.409 --> 36:03.661
Yeah, should I be mad
at him instead

36:03.703 --> 36:05.496
for getting his guys
to rough me up?

36:05.538 --> 36:07.081
Oh, that's right, Vic.

36:07.123 --> 36:09.375
It wasn't Macawi's men
who taught me a lesson.

36:09.417 --> 36:11.002
It was you.

36:11.043 --> 36:12.837
You think the Federal Bureau
of Investigation

36:12.879 --> 36:14.172
would like to know that one

36:14.213 --> 36:16.174
of their top guys
had somebody in the joint

36:16.215 --> 36:18.551
kick the crap out of me
so that I'd squeal?

36:18.593 --> 36:20.136
I don't know what
you're talking about.

36:20.178 --> 36:21.220
Really?

36:21.262 --> 36:22.680
When they kicked me in the head,

36:22.722 --> 36:24.265
they didn't do it very hard.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.433
[buzzer sounds, door unlocks]

Now, I'm not stupid.

36:25.474 --> 36:27.226
GUARD:
Opening.

36:27.268 --> 36:29.395
You pulled an old trick
to try to get me to turn.

36:29.437 --> 36:31.314
Guess what, Vic?

36:31.355 --> 36:33.065
Never gonna talk.

36:33.107 --> 36:34.609
You know, you might
never turn on Bodaway,

36:34.650 --> 36:35.818
but guess what, Jimmy?

36:35.860 --> 36:37.612
Bodaway's gonna turn on you.

36:37.653 --> 36:38.613
[phone beeps off]

36:44.368 --> 36:47.371
You got to get me out of here.

36:47.413 --> 36:49.081
I paid you off.

36:49.123 --> 36:51.500
Now I got to spring you out?

36:51.542 --> 36:54.754
What's in it for me?

36:54.795 --> 36:56.923
You get me out of here.

36:56.964 --> 36:58.174
I'll help you find
Bridget Kelly.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.023
Miss Farrell?

37:14.065 --> 37:15.066
Get in.

37:35.419 --> 37:38.547
Should I put up
the privacy window?

37:38.589 --> 37:39.966
No, it's fine.
Thank you.

37:47.431 --> 37:50.685
Did you bring your gun?

37:50.726 --> 37:52.645
My gun?

37:52.687 --> 37:57.441
Oh, I'm sorry, when you said
the usual, I just assumed.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.777
So I guess you mean
the other usual.

37:59.819 --> 38:01.320
But just so you know,
traffic's a little backed up.

38:01.362 --> 38:04.323
It'll take us about 45 minutes
to get to JFK.

38:04.365 --> 38:07.034
The airport.

38:07.076 --> 38:11.998
You don't remember the last time
you took me there, do you?

38:12.039 --> 38:14.166
About 9 months ago.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.293
Said you were headed to Wyoming.

38:18.879 --> 38:21.590
Wyoming, are you sure?

38:21.632 --> 38:23.592
Positive.

38:23.634 --> 38:25.511
Definitely Wyoming.

38:25.553 --> 38:26.721
Said you were looking
for an old friend.

38:30.850 --> 38:32.768
You know what,
I-I changed my mind.

38:32.810 --> 38:34.103
Will you take me back
to the apartment, please?

38:38.149 --> 38:40.568
[phone beeps, line ringing]

38:40.609 --> 38:42.111
You've reached
Professor Malcolm Ward.

Please leave a message
at the tone.

Malcolm, it's me.

Siobhan lied.

38:47.158 --> 38:49.535
She knew where I was
before the trial.

38:49.577 --> 38:52.913
She knew I was in Wyoming
because she was there, too.

38:52.955 --> 38:54.623
I don't get it.

38:54.665 --> 38:57.168
If she was looking for me,
why didn't she just contact me?

39:06.761 --> 39:08.971
I get why you turned
me in to Machado.

39:09.013 --> 39:11.265
I can explain this.

39:11.307 --> 39:12.308
Just let me
show you something.

as someone's maid?

never let me up

if you knew who
it really was.

Damn straight.

39:46.842 --> 39:49.762
What do you want?

39:49.804 --> 39:53.265
I heard you weren't gonna
press charges against Mr. C.

39:53.307 --> 39:54.975
And I think that there's
something that you should know.

sex with him, too.

you know what?

40:24.672 --> 40:26.006
We have been out here
for half an hour,

40:26.048 --> 40:28.134
and you haven't said
a word to me, Siobhan.

What are you desperate
to show me outside
of your building?

40:30.636 --> 40:32.012
Would you just trust me?

40:32.054 --> 40:33.305
It's something you
need to see to believe.

OK, whatever it is,
you take a photo.

40:34.723 --> 40:35.683

You believe that
I'm Siobhan, right?

40:44.400 --> 40:45.651
Uh, yeah.

40:45.693 --> 40:46.902
Then look behind me.

41:04.462 --> 41:05.880
That's Bridget.

She's the one living
a lie with Andrew,

41:07.298 --> 41:08.340
not me.

And I'm still pregnant
