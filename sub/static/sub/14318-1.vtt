[theme music playing]

01:00.500 --> 01:02.208
[roaring]

01:02.208 --> 01:04.083
[news reporter] Today,
the downtown area

01:04.083 --> 01:05.583
was rocked by
another outbreak of violence.

01:06.083 --> 01:08.458
The fact that the perpetrator
is believed to be a mutant

01:08.458 --> 01:12.000
has fueled current
anti-mutant hysteria
now growing nationwide.

01:14.500 --> 01:17.500
Though one witness said only
one isolated, big, hairy...

01:17.500 --> 01:20.208
She's one of them, Martha.
She needs help.

01:20.458 --> 01:24.875
But how could you register her
with that Mutant Control Agency

01:24.875 --> 01:26.708
as if she were
some sort of criminal?

01:27.083 --> 01:29.208
The agency isn't a prison,
Martha.

01:29.708 --> 01:32.958
It's an outreach program
to help
these unfortunate people.

01:33.708 --> 01:35.000
It's for her own good.

01:35.875 --> 01:37.291
You know I love her.

01:37.416 --> 01:39.291
But what will happen
to her now?

01:39.291 --> 01:42.166
I don't know. Let's just hope
the neighbors never find out

01:42.166 --> 01:43.875
our beautiful Jubilee
is a mutant.

01:43.875 --> 01:45.208
They'd never understand.

01:47.458 --> 01:49.166
Why is this happening to me?

01:49.458 --> 01:51.333
I used to be a normal kid.

01:51.833 --> 01:53.583
It's not my fault.

02:13.833 --> 02:16.583
[foster mother]
What if we were wrong?
What if she isn't a mutant?

02:16.833 --> 02:20.250
Are you kidding? Look what she
did to the VCR
just by touching it!

02:26.000 --> 02:30.166
[sighing] Tell me the truth.
Are you sorry we took her in?

02:30.625 --> 02:32.000
[foster father] Of course not.

02:40.625 --> 02:41.708
[both gasp]

02:42.458 --> 02:46.416
Identification error.
Non-living objects.

02:46.416 --> 02:48.458
Begin tracking program.

02:48.458 --> 02:54.125
[foster mother] Jubilee?
Is everything all right?
[screaming]

02:57.625 --> 02:58.875
[Jubilee] They're ashamed
of me.

02:59.583 --> 03:01.291
I thought they loved me.

03:01.291 --> 03:02.291
[video game machines beeping]

03:02.958 --> 03:06.208
Come on. I'll teach you
to invade my universe.

03:07.625 --> 03:11.375
[Boy] ooh, Mommy! Buy me that!
Buy me that!

03:11.375 --> 03:13.458
[people screaming]

03:13.708 --> 03:15.250
Can't you do something?

03:15.250 --> 03:17.500
What do you want me to do,
arrest him?

03:19.333 --> 03:21.291
[Sentinel]
Closing on assigned target.

03:21.458 --> 03:24.208
What's so wrong with being
a mutant, anyway?

03:25.000 --> 03:27.291
No! Not again!

03:27.291 --> 03:30.833
Hey, you! Do you know
how much that game costs?

03:32.375 --> 03:34.083
Yeah, a quarter.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.250
Hey! You're one of them,
ain't you?

03:39.708 --> 03:42.708
We don't want you lousy mutants
around here!

03:43.583 --> 03:45.833
Stupid jerk arcade manager.

03:45.833 --> 03:46.833
[all groaning]

03:47.708 --> 03:50.000
Hey! Watch where you're going!

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Us?

03:53.708 --> 03:56.375
What bug crawled up her shorts?

04:00.458 --> 04:01.458
[screaming]

04:01.708 --> 04:04.000
[people screaming]

04:06.750 --> 04:08.458
Do not be alarmed.

04:08.833 --> 04:11.458
[Sentinel] I am here
to serve and protect.

04:11.708 --> 04:12.875
[Gambit] I'll take these.

04:14.750 --> 04:16.958
You must like to play cards.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.583
I like solitaire, OK.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.166
Unless I got someone
to play with.

04:23.583 --> 04:26.250
[people screaming]

04:28.291 --> 04:31.000
Hey! You dweebs, watch it!

04:34.875 --> 04:37.458
[stammering] I hope
you're just mall security.

04:41.375 --> 04:44.500
[Sentinel] Target identified.
Initiate capture.

04:44.833 --> 04:45.833
Target?

04:46.333 --> 04:49.416
Capture? Help!

04:51.458 --> 04:52.958
[screaming] Help!

04:53.250 --> 04:54.291
[man screaming] Run!

04:55.458 --> 04:56.958
Must be a sale.

04:56.958 --> 04:57.958
[Jubilee screaming] Help!

04:58.458 --> 04:59.625
Put me down.

04:59.875 --> 05:01.708
[shouting]

05:02.291 --> 05:04.125
Please!

05:04.833 --> 05:10.583
Storm, Mistress of the
Elements, commands you
to release that child!

05:10.958 --> 05:13.250
Lighten up on the speeches,
sugar.

05:13.250 --> 05:15.958
[Jubilee] Hey, lady!
Keep talking to him some more.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.250
[beeping]

05:19.250 --> 05:22.000
Unidentified mutants. Ignore.

05:23.000 --> 05:25.458
[Jubilee screaming]

05:33.416 --> 05:35.583
[Jubilee screaming]

05:37.083 --> 05:38.291
You're flying.

05:39.125 --> 05:40.625
[Sentinel] Mutant, stop.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.208
Did you see what she did?

05:52.583 --> 05:54.875
Yes, Rogue has a way with men.

05:58.375 --> 05:59.833
They feel great, I...

06:00.958 --> 06:03.500
Like anything else?

06:03.958 --> 06:06.833
Don't go away.
I'll be right back.

06:08.583 --> 06:09.583
[gasps]

06:13.458 --> 06:14.833
Just wait here.

06:17.333 --> 06:18.333
Wow!

06:20.166 --> 06:21.166
[woman yelling] What's that?

06:22.250 --> 06:24.166
Don't worry, chere,
your insurance can handle it.

06:25.625 --> 06:27.583
What is that thing, anyhow?

06:28.333 --> 06:29.333
[both grunt]

06:31.416 --> 06:32.416
[both groan]

06:33.250 --> 06:36.125
[groaning] A robot, I believe.

06:36.708 --> 06:38.958
-Halt, mutant.
-Who's a mutant?

06:39.458 --> 06:40.875
Don't answer that.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.875
Hey! [screaming]

06:45.708 --> 06:48.458
-Where you going, petit?
-Anywhere but here.

06:48.458 --> 06:52.250
Stand aside. I must apprehend
that mutant.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.708
Hey, apprehend this.

06:59.083 --> 07:00.500
How did you do that?

07:00.708 --> 07:03.875
With style, petit. With style.

07:04.125 --> 07:07.083
-I am out of here.
-Wait! Gambit will help you.

07:07.083 --> 07:08.416
I am a mutant too.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.583
[Jubilee] I must be going nuts.

07:09.583 --> 07:10.583
Everybody's gone,

07:10.583 --> 07:11.708
people flying everywhere.

07:11.708 --> 07:13.000
The mall's turned into some

07:13.000 --> 07:14.458
creepy, for-real video game.

07:15.708 --> 07:20.000
Oh, please, Oh, please,
Oh, please. He doesn't see me.
I hope he doesn't see me.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.625
Oh, no, oh, no, oh, no!

07:24.000 --> 07:25.750
[beeping]

07:25.750 --> 07:28.458
[Sentinel] Unregistered mutant.
Expendable.

07:28.458 --> 07:29.458
[grunts]

07:30.416 --> 07:31.583
[Jubilee] Get away from him.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.000
I mean it!

07:37.083 --> 07:38.958
I don't believe this!

07:38.958 --> 07:40.875
Run, girl! Run!

07:46.166 --> 07:47.458
What did I ever do to anybody?

07:48.333 --> 07:51.583
I didn't ask to be a mutant.
I'm just a kid.

07:59.208 --> 08:02.625
[coughing] Who are you?

08:02.625 --> 08:04.583
Cyclops. Get down!

08:04.583 --> 08:08.708
[coughing]
[weakly] I don't have
a whole lot of choice.

08:10.125 --> 08:11.875
[Cyclops] Energy blast, huh?

08:12.625 --> 08:14.250
Here's one from a pro.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.125
[groaning]

08:25.958 --> 08:27.000
Where am I?

08:27.000 --> 08:28.291
[machine beeping]

08:28.291 --> 08:30.333
What is this place?
[gasps]

08:30.875 --> 08:32.583
Shh. Be quiet.

08:33.708 --> 08:35.583
I hate machines.

08:43.583 --> 08:44.708
Locked.

08:45.291 --> 08:47.375
OK. Zap it.

08:48.208 --> 08:50.625
Oh, come on.
I know you're in there.

08:50.958 --> 08:51.958
That's better.

08:56.875 --> 08:59.833
Mutant powers definitely have
their advantages.

09:03.750 --> 09:06.875
It would be quite disconcerting
if this were to detonate.

09:09.625 --> 09:12.250
Disconcerting, yet provocative.

09:12.250 --> 09:14.375
How do I get out of here?

09:14.375 --> 09:16.875
[Kelly on TV] This shocking
incident at New Salem Mall

09:16.875 --> 09:20.583
is just part
of the growing menace
of mutant violence.

09:20.583 --> 09:25.333
My fellow Americans,
I am an idiot. [laughing]

09:26.083 --> 09:29.083
Aggression, a new scent
for men.

09:29.750 --> 09:32.875
[husky voice] Aggression,
by Calvin Clone.

09:32.875 --> 09:36.208
[announcer] Was this girl
kidnapped by mutants?
Film at 11:00.

09:36.583 --> 09:38.583
Mall violence .Film at 11:00.

09:40.083 --> 09:43.875
-[voice 1] I'm gone!
-[voice 2] Where you going?
[laughing]

09:44.000 --> 09:47.416
[female announcer] A strange
woman was spotted
near the scene of violence...

09:47.416 --> 09:49.958
[male announcer] High above
city hall, an amateur video
caught a glimpse of...

09:50.875 --> 09:52.583
[Sabretooth growling]

09:53.875 --> 09:58.500
It's time we recognized that
all mutants are potentially
dangerous to mankind.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.000
Get a life.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.750
[Xavier] What happened
at the mall was inevitable.

10:05.958 --> 10:10.708
Jean, I knew the existence
of the X-Men would be revealed
to the public one day,

10:11.083 --> 10:12.500
but not like this.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.625
Wait a minute.
Those monitors were on.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.208
It's the girl, Jean.

10:20.458 --> 10:21.625
[Xavier]
She's trying to escape.

10:22.583 --> 10:25.583
[Professor X on PA] This is
Professor Xavier. Code three.

10:26.166 --> 10:27.750
We have an intruder.

10:27.958 --> 10:29.375
[alarm ringing]

10:29.375 --> 10:30.875
[Morph] Check down that way,
Beast.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.750
The intruder will not elude me.

10:34.583 --> 10:35.958
Come on!

10:37.208 --> 10:39.083
Oh, just do it!

10:40.875 --> 10:45.208
[computer voice] Initiate
Gambit-Wolverine training
sequence.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.750
Wow!

10:48.750 --> 10:49.875
[screaming]

10:50.291 --> 10:53.375
I was better off
with the giant robot.

10:53.708 --> 10:56.333
Petit?
This is no place for you.

10:59.458 --> 11:01.708
[Gambit]
There you are, Wolverine.

11:06.000 --> 11:07.166
[grunts]

11:07.708 --> 11:09.958
[computer]
Piston sequence initiated.

11:15.291 --> 11:20.458
Tag. You're it.
This game is over.

11:23.583 --> 11:24.875
Had enough, Cajun?

11:24.875 --> 11:26.875
Just say, "Oncle"...

11:26.875 --> 11:28.708
-[Jubilee] Don't hurt him!
-Huh?

11:31.875 --> 11:32.875
[loud bang]

11:35.875 --> 11:37.291
[Storm] Is the child all right?

11:37.625 --> 11:41.000
[groaning] Not for long.

11:41.458 --> 11:46.125
They were fighting,
and I wanted to help him,
and boom!

11:46.125 --> 11:50.000
[all laughing]

11:50.291 --> 11:51.958
[Wolverine growling]

11:51.958 --> 11:53.500
Don't worry, petit.

11:53.500 --> 11:56.875
You just hurt
Wolverine's pride, that's all.

11:56.875 --> 11:59.458
What is this weird place?

11:59.458 --> 12:02.583
[Beast] One part gymnasium,
one part survival course,

12:03.125 --> 12:06.750
affectionately referred to
as the Danger Room.

12:07.291 --> 12:10.708
Come with me, child.
I shall explain who we are.

12:16.708 --> 12:19.416
[Storm] All of us here are
mutants, like yourself.

12:19.416 --> 12:22.958
Well, tell me this.
What is a mutant?

12:23.291 --> 12:25.958
No one knows
who will be a mutant at birth.

12:26.458 --> 12:30.833
We discover
our extraordinary powers
at about your age.

12:31.125 --> 12:36.250
Professor Xavier is our
leader, and he has named us
the X-Men.

12:36.375 --> 12:38.708
Don't worry. You are safe here.

12:38.708 --> 12:43.000
Because I can control
the weather, they
call me Storm.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.458
At least your name makes sense.
My name's Jubilee.

12:46.708 --> 12:48.500
I blow stuff up.

12:48.958 --> 12:50.833
You've come to the right place.

12:51.166 --> 12:54.708
This is Professor Xavier's
School for the Gifted.

12:54.708 --> 12:56.708
Gifted, huh? I get you.

12:56.875 --> 13:01.875
That's a nice way of saying
"mutants", "weirdos", like me.

13:01.875 --> 13:03.708
Like all of us.

13:04.250 --> 13:08.166
Aren't you guys a little old
for school? Or did you all get
held back?

13:08.166 --> 13:11.958
We X-Men learn something
very special here, Jubilee.

13:14.375 --> 13:19.583
How to control our mutant
powers for the benefit
of mankind.

13:19.583 --> 13:21.875
All right, already!

13:24.125 --> 13:26.375
But then why do people hate us?

13:26.375 --> 13:29.208
[Storm] People fear what they
do not understand.

13:29.625 --> 13:33.166
[Xavier] I managed
to retrieve part of the robot's
visual memory.

13:33.166 --> 13:35.750
Take a closer look
as I replay it.

13:37.875 --> 13:40.208
[Rogue] Howdy, Wolverine.
Take a load off.

13:41.333 --> 13:43.750
Anybody notify
the kid's parents?

13:43.750 --> 13:46.333
We gave them a holler,
but nobody hollered back.

13:46.333 --> 13:47.333
[Xavier] There.

13:48.750 --> 13:54.583
That ID photograph is
from the Mutant Control Agency
registration files.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.583
That's how the robot found her.

13:57.583 --> 14:01.125
Professor Xavier, could
the government be plotting
against mutants?

14:01.125 --> 14:05.333
No, the Mutant Control Agency
is a private organization,

14:05.333 --> 14:07.416
occasionally supported
by the government.

14:08.500 --> 14:14.208
Someone at the agency appears
to have a hidden agenda.

14:14.208 --> 14:17.333
Does your daughter have any
mutant friends?

14:17.833 --> 14:19.458
These women, perhaps.

14:19.458 --> 14:22.166
We don't really know much
about her friends.

14:22.166 --> 14:26.458
She's only been with us a year.
She's a foster child.

14:26.458 --> 14:28.958
[foster father] She always
kept her secrets to herself.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.166
I gotta make sure they're OK.
[panting]

14:48.833 --> 14:49.833
Hey!

15:01.458 --> 15:02.458
What the...

15:08.291 --> 15:09.291
[grunts]

15:11.083 --> 15:12.583
Oh, no.

15:16.250 --> 15:17.833
[coughing]

15:18.500 --> 15:20.416
Not again.

15:21.708 --> 15:24.000
[Sentinel 1] Target mutant
apprehended.

15:24.166 --> 15:25.166
[Gyrich] Good work.

15:28.875 --> 15:32.500
[Xavier] That building
is the headquarters
of the Mutant Control Agency.

15:33.208 --> 15:38.333
Somewhere in there are the
registration files of hundreds
of mutants,

15:38.333 --> 15:41.166
innocently duped into
revealing their identities.

15:41.166 --> 15:44.416
So we get them
and we shred them.

15:44.416 --> 15:47.583
I'd get in there alone, easy.

15:47.583 --> 15:50.500
No, Storm will take three
X-Men in with her.

15:50.500 --> 15:53.458
Wolverine and Beast and Morph.

15:54.708 --> 16:00.583
If it makes you feel any better,
Gambit, I'll go in like this,
huh? [laughing]

16:01.125 --> 16:04.291
[Xavier]
Cyclops, you will be
in overall command.

16:04.875 --> 16:06.208
[Cyclops] Professor Xavier.

16:07.375 --> 16:11.416
We've been together
for a long time. And I strongly
believe, as you do,

16:11.416 --> 16:14.500
in the peaceful
coexistence between humans
and mutants.

16:14.500 --> 16:20.166
But when you formed the X-Men,
was it not to teach us to use
our powers to benefit mankind,

16:20.166 --> 16:22.458
so ordinary people would learn
not to fear us?

16:22.458 --> 16:23.958
Professor, aren't we--

16:23.958 --> 16:25.750
I know what you're
going to say, Cyclops,

16:25.750 --> 16:28.083
but I'm afraid
we have no choice.

16:29.458 --> 16:30.875
What's the matter?

16:31.875 --> 16:34.458
Teacher's pet got cold feet?

16:35.458 --> 16:38.125
Anytime, pretty boy.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.250
[Jean] Cyclops.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.000
I just went to check
on Jubilee. She's gone.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.458
-I'm going after her.
-No way, Wolverine.

16:45.458 --> 16:47.166
We've got a job to do first.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.333
[growling]

16:48.333 --> 16:51.000
I go. I wanna go.

16:52.708 --> 16:54.583
Out of the way, gumbo.

16:57.125 --> 16:59.333
Gambit! Let him go.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.291
Ah, he's not worth it.

17:11.416 --> 17:14.583
[Cyclops] Rogue, everybody,
stay close.

17:14.583 --> 17:16.083
[Rogue] Not too close.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.708
You know,
I remember when I was 13.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.458
Had me a boyfriend,

17:20.875 --> 17:22.375
till I kissed him.

17:22.375 --> 17:24.708
Poor boy was in a coma
for three days.

17:25.416 --> 17:31.333
That was when I first realized,
if I touched anybody, I absorb
their strength right into me.

17:32.125 --> 17:33.375
Some power, huh?

17:33.875 --> 17:36.458
That's when the boys
quit calling.

17:38.708 --> 17:41.875
Consider yourself fortunate.
I had dandruff.

17:41.875 --> 17:43.958
Hey, whenever I got at school,
I used to turn myself at school,

17:44.125 --> 17:47.208
I used to turn myself
into the principal.[laughing]

17:47.208 --> 17:48.333
[grunts]

17:49.583 --> 17:53.000
[Rogue] It like to kill my
daddy when he found out
I was a mutant.

17:53.000 --> 17:55.125
We all had to face
that problem.

17:55.125 --> 17:57.166
[Storm] Hold it. We are here.

17:59.291 --> 18:01.708
You're supposed to know
everything, Beast.

18:01.708 --> 18:03.625
What makes us like we are,
anyway?

18:03.625 --> 18:09.125
Gamma rays. Pollution.
Ozone depletion.
Television!

18:09.125 --> 18:10.458
Progress.

18:10.458 --> 18:11.875
[Wolverine] Lousy luck.

18:12.750 --> 18:15.125
You sure make a lot of noise.

18:18.083 --> 18:19.833
You decided to join us, eh?

18:19.958 --> 18:21.000
Yeah.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.458
[insects chirping]

18:22.458 --> 18:24.083
Did you find the child?

18:24.083 --> 18:26.458
Her trail went cold
outside the house.

18:27.500 --> 18:29.458
Got bit by a dog too.

18:30.333 --> 18:32.875
OK, Storm, do your thing.

18:34.708 --> 18:36.875
[thunder rumbling]

18:49.708 --> 18:52.000
Hey, can you guys boost me
over the fence, Beast?

18:54.708 --> 18:56.875
[Morph screaming]
[loud thud]

18:56.875 --> 18:58.125
[Wolverine] Looks like we can.

19:00.625 --> 19:01.625
[guard] Are you all right?

19:03.125 --> 19:05.208
-Never better.
-What...

19:06.958 --> 19:09.750
Nighty-night.
[laughing]

19:16.875 --> 19:18.333
They're inside the perimeter.

19:20.416 --> 19:21.500
Halt!

19:35.458 --> 19:36.458
[Beast clears throat]

19:36.958 --> 19:38.875
The guard's keys?

19:38.875 --> 19:40.958
So I'll buy them a new door.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.750
Hold it. Electronic beams.

19:45.500 --> 19:47.833
You can detect the infrared
spectrum?

19:47.833 --> 19:49.583
I can smell them.

19:49.583 --> 19:50.583
[sniffing]

19:51.458 --> 19:52.875
Ozone.

19:54.083 --> 19:58.291
You will see them as well,
as the mist rises.

20:01.625 --> 20:06.833
"With faint heart, averted feet
and many a tear, in our
opposed path to persevere"

20:07.333 --> 20:09.375
A minor poet
for a minor obstacle.

20:19.875 --> 20:22.000
I wonder. "Security."

20:22.583 --> 20:24.583
Are any of us ever
truly secure?

20:27.375 --> 20:31.250
You look nervous
as a long-tailed cat in a room
full of rocking chairs.

20:31.250 --> 20:33.500
I just wish I knew what was
happening in there.

20:35.708 --> 20:37.166
We got trouble.

20:37.458 --> 20:40.500
[Morph] It looks like clear
sailing from here. Ha ha.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.875
[theme music playing]
