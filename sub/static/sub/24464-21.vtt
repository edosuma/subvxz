00:11.077 --> 00:12.408
Dude, hurry!

00:12.479 --> 00:13.503
It's back! It's back!

00:13.580 --> 00:14.478
Aah-ha-ha!

00:14.547 --> 00:16.640
We now return to...

00:16.716 --> 00:19.241
"Fool Me Once, Shame On You.

00:19.319 --> 00:22.618
Fool Me Twice,
I Punch Your Face!"

00:24.090 --> 00:25.557
Hai!
I am Announcerbot!

00:25.625 --> 00:26.751
Whoo! Yeah!

00:26.826 --> 00:30.023
And now here's Shinehara!

00:30.096 --> 00:31.961
Thank you, Announcerbot.

00:32.031 --> 00:35.559
I am Gamemaster
Mitsuru Shinehara.

00:35.635 --> 00:38.035
Before break, Clive from U. K.

00:38.104 --> 00:40.299
Fool me once...

00:40.373 --> 00:43.467
Shame... On... You!

00:43.543 --> 00:45.875
Wh-o-o-o-oa!

00:45.945 --> 00:46.934
What is this?

00:47.013 --> 00:48.105
Japanese game show.

00:48.181 --> 00:50.308
Round 2!

00:50.383 --> 00:53.682
Now, Clive,
try to fool me again.

00:53.753 --> 00:55.653
Well, I'd like to Shinehara-san,

00:55.722 --> 00:57.781
but you've got some food
stuck between your teeth.

00:57.857 --> 00:58.846
Oh!

00:58.925 --> 01:00.893
Announcerbot, please,
fetch toothpick.

01:00.960 --> 01:02.757
Ha ha!
Fooled you mate!

01:02.829 --> 01:05.126
Yeeah!

01:05.197 --> 01:08.964
You fool me twice!

01:09.035 --> 01:10.024
Baka Blitz!

01:10.103 --> 01:11.297
Dude, he's a goner.

01:11.371 --> 01:13.498
Nobody's ever completed
the "Baka Blitz."

01:15.575 --> 01:20.342
You have 10 minutes
to reach goal and grab mystery prize.

01:20.413 --> 01:26.613
But if time runs out or you
give up, I punch your face.

01:26.686 --> 01:27.914
What do you think
the mystery prize is?

01:27.987 --> 01:29.750
I heard it's a bajillion yen,

01:29.823 --> 01:31.381
which is like a majillion
dollars!

01:31.458 --> 01:33.483
I heard it's an
800-pound tuna.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.357
You could buy a house
with that in Japan.

01:36.563 --> 01:37.621
You know what I heard?

01:37.697 --> 01:39.562
This show is garbage!

01:39.632 --> 01:42.260
Clive, ready?

01:42.335 --> 01:44.235
Go!

01:46.106 --> 01:48.301
Come on! Yeah!

01:48.374 --> 01:50.706
Aah! Oof!

01:50.777 --> 01:51.744
My eyes!

01:51.811 --> 01:52.937
No more!

01:53.012 --> 01:55.276
Ohh!

01:59.652 --> 02:01.313
Why are you guys
into this stuff?

02:02.388 --> 02:03.412
'Cause it's funny.

02:03.490 --> 02:04.548
You're a wet blanket, man!

02:04.624 --> 02:05.591
No, I'm not!

02:05.658 --> 02:08.024
Attention, U.S. Viewers.

02:08.094 --> 02:10.858
For the first time ever,
we are looking for

02:10.930 --> 02:12.795
American contestants.

02:12.866 --> 02:16.495
During broadcast tomorrow,
we will flash phone number.

02:16.569 --> 02:19.231
Be first to call and
you'll be on show!

02:19.305 --> 02:20.863
You just won!

02:22.675 --> 02:24.142
Whoa! I'm in Japan!

02:24.210 --> 02:25.438
Land line only.

02:25.512 --> 02:27.810
I know what we're doing
at 4:30 tomorrow.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.576
Not on the park phones
you're not.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.207
But it says
land lines only!

02:31.284 --> 02:32.842
That's a long-distance call.

02:32.919 --> 02:34.853
We could win the
mystery prize.

02:37.690 --> 02:38.588
Hm-hm!

02:39.859 --> 02:41.224
Go!

02:41.294 --> 02:42.352
2.2 seconds.

02:42.428 --> 02:43.725
Still needs work.

02:44.964 --> 02:46.158
Hey, Benson.

02:46.232 --> 02:47.062
How's it going?

02:47.133 --> 02:48.361
What's up, man?

02:48.434 --> 02:51.494
What did I tell you
about using the park phone?!

02:51.571 --> 02:52.503
Ugh!

02:52.572 --> 02:54.199
I feel something
kind of damp.

02:54.274 --> 02:55.502
Yeah, I feel it, too.

02:55.575 --> 02:56.542
What do you think it is?

02:56.609 --> 02:57.576
I don't know.

02:57.644 --> 02:58.804
Feels kind of like
a wet blanket.

02:58.878 --> 03:00.106
Very funny.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.013
Now hang it up and put the TV
back in the living room!

03:03.082 --> 03:04.549
Aw, come on, Benson!

03:04.617 --> 03:06.380
We really think
we can do this.

03:06.452 --> 03:08.044
I don't care.

03:08.121 --> 03:10.851
If I catch you trying this
again, you're fired!

03:10.924 --> 03:12.653
M-a-a-an...

03:12.725 --> 03:14.056
This blows.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.617
I can't think of a single
reason to keep on living

03:15.695 --> 03:16.957
if we can't be
on this show.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.429
- Wait!
- What?

03:18.498 --> 03:21.490
I have a plan, and
it is the single most perfect

03:21.568 --> 03:24.059
plan in the history of plans.

03:33.780 --> 03:36.271
30 tomorrow.

03:48.228 --> 03:49.456
Do you think he
fell for it?

03:49.529 --> 03:50.587
Of course, dude.

03:50.663 --> 03:51.721
I went to art school.

03:51.798 --> 03:52.730
You didn't graduate.

03:52.799 --> 03:53.697
Quiet!

03:53.766 --> 03:55.358
Open this door right now!

03:56.603 --> 03:59.401
Welcome to "Fool Me Once,
Shame On You.

03:59.472 --> 04:03.203
Fool Me Twice,
I Punch Your Face."

04:03.276 --> 04:04.402
Just show the number!

04:04.477 --> 04:06.342
You two better not
call that number!

04:06.412 --> 04:07.709
Come on!

04:07.780 --> 04:09.475
Hang up that phone now!

04:09.549 --> 04:11.176
The number is...

04:11.251 --> 04:12.275
Dude, dial!

04:12.352 --> 04:13.216
I'm dialing!

04:13.286 --> 04:15.948
Hello! We have a winner!

04:27.033 --> 04:29.228
What are your names, contestants?

04:29.302 --> 04:30.564
Omigosh!

04:30.637 --> 04:31.729
What the...

04:31.804 --> 04:34.329
Welcome, first American
contestants Omigosh, Er,

04:34.407 --> 04:36.500
and What The!

04:37.744 --> 04:39.109
No, no, no, there's
been a mistake,

04:39.178 --> 04:40.236
and we need to leave.

04:40.313 --> 04:42.611
Our names are Benson, Mordecai,
and Rigby.

04:42.682 --> 04:46.448
Oh, you fool me once!

04:46.519 --> 04:48.953
Shame... on... you!

04:50.857 --> 04:51.881
No!

04:51.958 --> 04:53.391
We weren't even
trying to fool you!

04:53.459 --> 04:54.926
But I thought you were.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.721
This makes no sense!

04:57.797 --> 05:02.325
You fool me twice!

05:03.303 --> 05:05.362
You know what that means!

05:05.438 --> 05:06.598
Baka Blitz!

05:06.673 --> 05:07.765
Baka Blitz! Baka Blitz!

05:07.840 --> 05:09.569
Stop!

05:09.642 --> 05:10.734
Stop!

05:10.810 --> 05:12.539
I refuse to play!

05:12.612 --> 05:14.136
Baka Blitz!

05:16.683 --> 05:17.877
- Whoa!
- Awesome.

05:20.553 --> 05:24.512
You have 10 minutes to get to goal.

05:24.590 --> 05:27.320
But if you give up
before time ends,

05:27.393 --> 05:28.382
I punch your faces.

05:28.461 --> 05:29.519
Awesome!

05:29.595 --> 05:30.493
Wait. What?

05:30.563 --> 05:33.088
I just wanted to say, we're
gonna make history tonight!

05:33.166 --> 05:36.101
We're gonna be the first
ever to win the mystery prize!

05:36.169 --> 05:37.500
Yee-ah!

05:37.570 --> 05:39.697
U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

05:39.772 --> 05:43.230
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

05:43.309 --> 05:44.833
Come on!
Say "U.S.A." with us, Benson.

05:44.911 --> 05:46.208
Are you guys crazy?!

05:46.279 --> 05:48.975
You guys said nobody's
ever beat it before!

05:49.048 --> 05:51.016
Dude, we've watched
it a million times.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.450
There's a good chance
we'll win the mystery prize.

05:53.519 --> 05:54.577
A chance?!

05:54.654 --> 05:56.588
What if we get punched
in the face?!

05:56.656 --> 05:57.987
Benson, this is TV.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.490
Nobody really gets hurt.

05:59.559 --> 06:01.891
Sincerity Spotlight!

06:01.961 --> 06:04.327
You know, we have
lots of fun on show,

06:04.397 --> 06:06.865
and I may not show it,
but actually,

06:06.933 --> 06:09.231
I <i>hate</i> being fooled.

06:09.302 --> 06:13.432
So it has been great pleasure
defending prize by punching

06:13.506 --> 06:15.167
liars in face.

06:15.241 --> 06:16.538
Let's watch.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.477
How does it feel to be the only
contestant who didn't die?

06:24.550 --> 06:27.485
I can't feel me face,
but at least I'm alive!

06:31.023 --> 06:32.456
Thank you, thank you.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.823
Listen, I...
wait!

06:34.894 --> 06:36.521
Come on. Can't we forfeit?

06:40.700 --> 06:41.894
Ready?

06:43.002 --> 06:44.629
What are we gonna do?

06:46.439 --> 06:47.303
Benson?

06:47.373 --> 06:48.499
Come on, fellas.

06:48.574 --> 06:50.337
We got a game show to win.

06:50.410 --> 06:51.672
Go!

06:58.384 --> 06:59.510
Come on!

07:12.565 --> 07:13.964
Do you give up?

07:14.033 --> 07:15.193
No!

07:57.343 --> 07:58.207
Ugh!

07:58.277 --> 07:59.437
Worry not, my pet.

07:59.512 --> 08:03.209
No one has ever made
it through the Gutinator.

08:10.356 --> 08:13.018
Hurry!

08:13.092 --> 08:14.787
We can't...

08:14.861 --> 08:16.726
This is what you wanted,
isn't it?

08:16.796 --> 08:19.765
It looked so much
easier on TV.

08:21.367 --> 08:23.528
Make it stop!

08:23.603 --> 08:25.332
Ohh!

08:25.404 --> 08:26.735
I want to go home.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.774
Come on.

08:32.945 --> 08:34.537
The goal!

08:42.455 --> 08:43.513
Don't have much time.

08:43.589 --> 08:44.419
Huh?

08:47.627 --> 08:48.821
Ohh!

08:48.895 --> 08:52.956
Nobody's ever won,
and nobody ever will.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.192
Whoa, whoa...

08:54.267 --> 08:55.598
you can't shoot us!

08:55.668 --> 08:56.999
Shoot?

09:00.873 --> 09:02.101
Wha?

09:02.174 --> 09:03.835
Dude, what's up
with your hand?!

09:03.910 --> 09:07.539
It's gone too long
without punching a face.

09:07.613 --> 09:08.580
Unh!

09:08.648 --> 09:11.242
Aaaaah!

09:11.317 --> 09:12.545
But you can't punch us!

09:12.618 --> 09:13.607
We haven't given up!

09:13.686 --> 09:14.653
Too bad!

09:14.720 --> 09:17.814
It is my show!

09:20.526 --> 09:22.221
Yaaah!

09:22.295 --> 09:23.421
Run!

09:26.732 --> 09:28.700
Any last words?

09:32.605 --> 09:34.573
Look! It's Mt. Fuji!

09:34.640 --> 09:35.538
Huh?

09:36.542 --> 09:38.032
Aah!

09:38.110 --> 09:39.509
Run! Run!

09:39.579 --> 09:40.443
No!

09:40.513 --> 09:42.174
You fooled me three times!

09:42.248 --> 09:44.216
No! No!

09:44.283 --> 09:45.614
Aah!

09:50.423 --> 09:53.483
The Americans
are almost there!

09:56.896 --> 09:57.828
Hachi!

09:57.897 --> 09:58.864
Shichi!

09:58.931 --> 10:00.125
Roku!

10:00.199 --> 10:01.131
Go!

10:01.200 --> 10:02.565
Shi!

10:02.635 --> 10:03.533
San!

10:03.603 --> 10:04.501
Ni!

10:04.570 --> 10:06.834
Ichi!

10:14.013 --> 10:17.278
U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.!

10:18.517 --> 10:19.609
Excellent work.

10:19.685 --> 10:21.585
You have won
the mystery prize.

10:21.654 --> 10:23.485
Your choice of...

10:23.556 --> 10:26.923
A state-of-the-art clipboard
with built-in clock and

10:26.993 --> 10:29.393
calculator, or...

10:29.462 --> 10:32.431
a trip to Space Camp!

10:32.498 --> 10:34.125
- Space Camp!
- Clipboard!

10:34.200 --> 10:35.895
Congratulations!

10:35.968 --> 10:39.335
You are the first contestants
to beat the Baka Blitz

10:39.405 --> 10:42.067
without being punched
or dying.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.803
This means I have failed.

10:44.877 --> 10:48.472
Gomen-nasai,
shinahara-senpai.

10:50.816 --> 10:51.908
Hello?

10:51.984 --> 10:54.714
Ready to get picked
up from Space Camp?

10:54.787 --> 10:55.981
Yeah, but...

10:56.055 --> 10:58.182
I'm having the
time of my life!

10:58.257 --> 10:59.952
