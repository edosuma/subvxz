So you're hiding it in a tree

02:13.258 --> 02:15.093
Are you okay? What happened?

Really?

02:22.267 --> 02:23.518
[Gigi] Ran away, Ted.

Your baby's been out of control
since I got here.

I can't take my eyes off him for five
seconds before he's getting into this,

causing trouble with that,
disappearing into who knows where.

-Tim was never like this.
-Yes! Still the good kid.

02:37.949 --> 02:38.783
Sorry.

How am I supposed
to keep babies number one in the world

02:53.173 --> 02:55.175
if I can't even get out in the world?

02:55.258 --> 02:57.802
She's all over me like ointment on a rash.

02:58.094 --> 03:00.680
Why would you purposely be the rash
in your own story?

03:00.763 --> 03:03.016
Focus, Templeton. I need Gigi off my back.

03:03.099 --> 03:06.019
You're good with old people.
How do you get rid of one?

03:07.937 --> 03:09.856
-Temporarily.
-You heard her.

03:09.939 --> 03:13.234
She feels like she can't leave you alone,
and can you blame her?

03:13.318 --> 03:15.069
You fight her on everything.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.946
[chuckles] Of course I do.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.032
How else is she supposed to learn
I'm the boss?

03:19.115 --> 03:21.826
-You want Gigi off your back?
-I literally just said I did.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.328
Then you back off.

03:23.411 --> 03:27.582
You and Gigi are my two favorite people
younger than me or twice as old as Dad.

03:27.665 --> 03:29.375
Just try being good for her.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.170
I'd rather drink a bottle of spiders.

03:32.629 --> 03:36.758
Okay, your dad tells me the library
does a tiny tots story hour.

03:37.133 --> 03:39.636

reading picture books about,

03:39.719 --> 03:42.305
I don't know, magic bears and crap. Ugh.

03:42.472 --> 03:45.225
I guess your parents think
baby needs some stimulation.

03:45.308 --> 03:46.601
I don't know.

03:46.851 --> 03:48.228
What do you think, Timmy?

03:48.853 --> 03:50.188
I think it's a great idea.

03:50.271 --> 03:51.648
You get an hour of quiet,

03:51.898 --> 03:55.193
and baby gets a chance
to prove how good he can be.

03:55.485 --> 03:58.488
Plus, they have comic books.

This will never be forgiven.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.547
[Gigi] You got room for one more?

04:16.839 --> 04:19.008
There's always room in story hour.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.387
Just find baby a place
on the magic carpet,

04:22.470 --> 04:26.224
and we'll get started in two shakes
of a unicorn's tail.

04:35.942 --> 04:37.485

04:38.111 --> 04:40.405
We're getting farther
from the goal here, Templeton.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.198
How does this get me back
out in the field?

04:42.532 --> 04:44.826
Easy. You want Gigi
to leave you alone for a while,

04:44.909 --> 04:47.578
show her you can be good for a while.
Like an hour.

04:49.247 --> 04:51.040
Like a story hour.

04:51.374 --> 04:53.042
Yes, Templeton, I got it.

-Come on, who's a big boy?

Ah, got hooked when I did my stretch
in daycare.

05:16.232 --> 05:20.361
The sweet mellow bliss of story hour
was the only thing that kept me sane.

05:20.778 --> 05:25.450
So to be clear, the person I deal with
on a daily basis is sane Staci?

05:25.533 --> 05:27.452
[laughs maniacally]

05:27.535 --> 05:28.369
Yes.

05:28.536 --> 05:31.914
And I love picture books
and human companionship.

05:31.998 --> 05:33.458
Oh, happy for both of you.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.002
What's the fastest way
to ditch this dog and pony show?

05:36.085 --> 05:40.214
-The sooner I get out of here--
-Where did baby's bottle go?

05:40.465 --> 05:41.466
The better.

-Why is that child missing his bottle?
-[shushing]

05:43.634 --> 05:46.220
Is it under his pillow?

05:46.387 --> 05:47.972
Makes sense.
Sometimes mine rolls under--

05:48.056 --> 05:49.474
No.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.309
[groans] Well, now it's a mystery.

05:51.392 --> 05:53.561
Is it under his crib?

05:53.644 --> 05:55.396
Nope. Just Teddy.

05:55.980 --> 05:58.483
Question the bear. He knows something.

05:58.691 --> 06:03.279
Is it under the rhinoceros?
Ooh, I hope not.

06:03.363 --> 06:07.158
[laughs] That's absurd.
Why would it even be there?

06:07.492 --> 06:10.286
Hmm. Where is baby's bottle?

06:10.369 --> 06:12.580
Come on, woman, quit giving the hard sell.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.459

-Oh, thank goodness.

06:19.170 --> 06:21.756
Sure you wouldn't rather drink spiders?

06:24.175 --> 06:26.761
I suppose, if it'll keep Gigi off my back,

06:26.844 --> 06:29.555
I could sit and be good
for one more story.

06:29.764 --> 06:32.892
Boom went the cannon,
sploosh went the ship

06:32.975 --> 06:37.146

scurvy pirate.

06:37.230 --> 06:39.190
Ha-ha! Arrgghhh.

06:39.273 --> 06:45.446
And when little lost gorilla
looked around, he was all alone.

Dinosaur, you don't wear pajamas.

06:49.784 --> 06:51.786

06:56.833 --> 07:00.670
And when the kindly old leopard told
the little lost gorilla, "You  are  home"...

07:00.753 --> 07:04.090
[gasps, stammers] ...I felt something.
I mean, right here.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.760
Well, look who sat and played nice
for a whole hour.

07:07.844 --> 07:09.512
What a surprisingly good boy.

07:09.679 --> 07:11.764
Yeah, I think he really liked it.

07:11.848 --> 07:14.142
Can the baby and me go play
in our room for a while?

07:14.225 --> 07:17.019
Sure. He seems well-behaved today.

07:17.228 --> 07:18.479
Thanks, Gigi.

07:19.772 --> 07:20.690
Well, look at that.

You played nice for a while,
and now you're free to go do business.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.198
You really want me to say you were right,
don't you?

07:29.282 --> 07:30.950
-I do.
-[Gigi] What do you think, Timmy?

07:31.033 --> 07:33.578
-Story hour again tomorrow?
-Sure.

07:37.415 --> 07:39.250
I'm so glad we found something you like,

07:40.168 --> 07:43.254
and I had a great time reading
trashy magazines with the other seniors.

07:43.337 --> 07:46.924
In fact, I was telling Frederic
how lucky it was to find something

07:47.008 --> 07:48.718
the babies all enjoy so much.

07:48.801 --> 07:50.303
You told Frederic?

07:57.810 --> 07:59.770
It's lovely to meet you.

07:59.854 --> 08:04.901
Would I be correct
if I called this place a library?

08:05.568 --> 08:08.029
Yes, of course you would.

08:08.112 --> 08:14.577
And this library is a place
where everyone is supposed to... shh.

08:16.162 --> 08:18.247
It's our most important rule.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.458
Well, then,

08:20.750 --> 08:24.045
-I'd say these babies don't belong here.
-What?

08:24.420 --> 08:26.005
Do they?

08:26.088 --> 08:28.758
But... this is story hour.

08:29.008 --> 08:33.012
And you go on and read
your hippy-dippy picture books.

08:33.095 --> 08:37.975
But rules is rules:
any baby makes any loud noises...

08:38.392 --> 08:40.061

I literally have nothing better to do
right now. I hate crime.

It's an old-fashioned turf war.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.950
Estes and his gang
are trying to muscle us out,

08:54.033 --> 08:55.910
take this library for themselves.

08:55.993 --> 08:57.787
They can't take story hour!

I need my stories, man. Lookit.

No noises, or the nice policeman
will have to take you bye-bye.

Timmy, of course, was a perfect angel.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.914
Yes! Still the good kid.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.917
-I assume no more story hour.
-Even worse.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.003
Estes got them to turn it into
"no babies" hour.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.507
If they even see a baby in there
between 11 and noon,

11:14.590 --> 11:18.719
all babies will be banned
from the library, any time, forever.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.513
Ugh, Estes!

11:20.596 --> 11:23.933
And Gigi's probably never gonna trust you
out of her sight again.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.726
-Ugh, Gigi!
-[monitor chimes, vibrates]

11:25.810 --> 11:26.727
[Jimbo]  Boss.

11:26.811 --> 11:27.645
Uh, Jimbo?

11:27.978 --> 11:31.440
-Uh, we got a situation.
-Yeah, sorry about story hour.

11:31.524 --> 11:33.776
We'll take our library back,
don't you worry.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.237
-How you holding up, big guy?
-I'm fine, thanks.

11:36.320 --> 11:37.321
[Staci screaming]

11:38.572 --> 11:40.866
-Staci's not.
-[ragged panting]

11:40.950 --> 11:44.662
I told you, boss. I need my stories.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.288
They keep me in my happy place,

11:46.372 --> 11:48.749
and you do not want me
in my unhappy place!

11:49.750 --> 11:51.836
Stay happy, stay happy. I'll fix this.

11:52.753 --> 11:54.505
[grunts, clears throat]

11:54.588 --> 11:56.924
Templeton,
you've got a basic public education.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.510
How'd you like to fill in
for emergency story hour?

12:01.095 --> 12:02.304
Better idea.

12:02.430 --> 12:05.641
So if you read the stories,
it's a win for everybody.

12:05.850 --> 12:06.767
I don't follow.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.395
He gets stories,
you get him calm and quiet.

12:09.603 --> 12:12.022
Why can't you just read him the stories?

12:12.356 --> 12:14.650
Because I want the two of you
to get along,

12:14.733 --> 12:17.695
and then you learn to trust the baby
and won't have to watch him all the time,

12:18.028 --> 12:21.699
and everybody stays completely sane.

12:22.283 --> 12:23.117
[sighs]

12:24.285 --> 12:26.954
Aw. I could never say no to my Timmy.

12:27.037 --> 12:29.206
Yes! Story hour with Gigi.

12:29.290 --> 12:31.792
I'm gonna go invite the baby's friends.
Love you.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.711
That baby has friends?

12:36.088 --> 12:39.383
[Staci squeals quietly]

12:39.467 --> 12:40.426
[giggles]

12:40.843 --> 12:43.012
-How does this work?
-You just read.

12:43.137 --> 12:44.346
Pick anything.

12:46.724 --> 12:50.352
Hmm.  The Sassy, Gassy Crocodile.

12:51.729 --> 12:54.023
Nope, nope, and nope.

"'Oh, no,' said Hippo sadly.
'All my friends forgot my birthday.'"

13:03.949 --> 13:07.161
Ugh. Don't tell me.
They're planning a surprise party.

13:07.411 --> 13:10.247
Yep, there it is. Shocker.
[blows raspberry]

13:10.831 --> 13:12.583
I did not see that coming.

13:12.666 --> 13:17.129
Does this family own any storybooks
that aren't flaming garbage?

13:17.213 --> 13:18.881
[whimpering]

13:21.842 --> 13:24.512
They're babies, Gigi.
They like this stuff.

13:24.595 --> 13:27.806
I'm not cut out for soft
and fuzzy nonsense.

13:27.890 --> 13:29.225
I'm from steel country.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.560
Spent my life in the mill,
turning fire into metal

13:31.644 --> 13:34.480
and beating down any goon squads
who tried to break our union.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.357
[babies giggle and coo]

13:37.691 --> 13:39.610
Goon beating,
that's what gets your attention.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.657
-If it works, it works.
-All right, kiddos.

13:44.740 --> 13:46.825
We're playin' this Gigi style.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.119
"Union," we'd shout.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.790
And oh, boy, did we give 'em what for.
Boom!

13:56.460 --> 13:58.295

13:58.379 --> 14:00.631
Another win for bonding with Gigi.

14:01.006 --> 14:05.427
And as Henry the boilermaker
lay there, two words escaped his lips.

14:05.844 --> 14:09.473
"Avenge me."

knuckles, you know how that feels.

14:23.112 --> 14:26.282
Somebody tries to take something from you
in this life, what do you do?

14:26.365 --> 14:27.950
You take it right back!

14:28.033 --> 14:30.369

14:36.458 --> 14:37.293
[Tim] Staci!

14:37.668 --> 14:39.169
Did you see which way she went?

14:39.336 --> 14:41.964
And there goes Gigi's story time.

14:43.757 --> 14:46.176
-[Tim] Babies, no.
-What in the world?

14:46.260 --> 14:47.720
Don't worry. I'll go after them.

14:47.803 --> 14:49.597
Timmy! What?

14:59.940 --> 15:00.900

15:14.496 --> 15:16.290
[grunts, laughs]

15:16.373 --> 15:18.751
[howls]

15:21.045 --> 15:22.254
Oh, no.

15:22.338 --> 15:24.298
What is that place?

15:24.548 --> 15:27.384
[Boss Baby] The public library.

15:28.844 --> 15:31.680
"Hollywood, the government
and young people.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.683
Are they plotting
to steal your silverware?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.310
Yes."

15:36.393 --> 15:38.020
-Oh, yes.
-Mm-hmm.

15:38.103 --> 15:41.065
-[vent cover slams]
-[Staci chuckles]

15:43.400 --> 15:45.945

[groans]

16:05.589 --> 16:06.423
[gasps]

16:06.924 --> 16:07.967
What are you doing here?

16:08.258 --> 16:09.969
Your grandma was right.

16:10.052 --> 16:14.098
Frederic and his old people gang took
this library from us, so what do we do?

16:14.181 --> 16:17.935
We take it back. [shrieks] Union!

16:29.822 --> 16:32.533
[groans, grunts]

16:34.284 --> 16:36.453
This place is crawling with seniors.

16:44.503 --> 16:47.548
I would love to take back our library
from them, but we need a plan.

16:47.631 --> 16:48.882
Got one.

16:50.259 --> 16:54.388
-[groans] Dagnabit!
-Sir, this is a library.

16:54.471 --> 16:56.890
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to ask you to leave.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.560
Horse apples. I pay my taxes.

16:59.643 --> 17:03.522

You're outta here, Mister Loud Noise Man.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.941
Wow, good thing I never leave this place.

17:06.025 --> 17:07.359
This could actually work.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.278

17:09.528 --> 17:10.696
It's grown-ups only hour.

17:10.779 --> 17:14.867
If they spot any of you here, they'll ban
babies from this library forever.

17:14.950 --> 17:18.537
Well, then I guess we'd better
not get caught. Right, Staci?

Shh. That's not a baby, ma'am.

17:28.422 --> 17:30.257
That's a big boy,

17:30.340 --> 17:33.427
and you're gonna need to take
that yelling outside.

17:33.510 --> 17:34.887
March.

17:34.970 --> 17:39.266
Keep the librarian distracted.
We'll take care of the old people.

17:45.856 --> 17:49.401
Here, little baby. Did you get lost?

Sorry to keep distracting you
for absolutely no reason involving babies,

18:49.503 --> 18:53.257

there's now a fiction and a nonfiction?

between the two?

and the other isn't.

19:00.222 --> 19:01.640

from the library for life.

You totally bonded with him.
