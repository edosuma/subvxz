Oh, hey,
there you are.

00:35.936 --> 00:37.936
Hey, listen, I got something
really cool I want you to see.

00:37.938 --> 00:39.138
What is it?

00:39.140 --> 00:41.006
This.
I found it in the yard.

00:41.008 --> 00:42.041
A tennis ball.

00:42.043 --> 00:44.143
That's very impressive, Brian.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.045
Yeah, but don't tell the other
dogs in the neighborhood.

00:46.047 --> 00:47.046
They'll be jealous.

00:47.048 --> 00:49.148
You son of a bitch.

00:49.150 --> 00:51.283
There's one tennis
ball out there

00:51.285 --> 00:53.118
that's even cooler
'cause I peed on it.

00:53.120 --> 00:53.952
Buried it years ago.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.421
I just can't
remember where.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.089
I'd give anything
to find it, though.

00:57.091 --> 00:58.924
Well, if you could recall
exactly when you buried it,

00:58.926 --> 01:00.492
I suppose I could
help you out.

01:00.494 --> 01:01.927
I remember the exact day.

01:01.929 --> 01:04.296
January 31, 1999.

01:04.298 --> 01:06.298
Very well, follow me, Brian.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.100
Watch out for Ernie.

01:08.102 --> 01:11.103
He's getting a CAT scan.

01:26.653 --> 01:29.154
Well, here we are.

01:29.156 --> 01:30.756
That's odd.

01:30.758 --> 01:33.125
It's our house, but somehow
it looks a little different.

01:33.127 --> 01:35.127
MEG: Mom, my lips
are too thin.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.962
Can I please get
collagen injections?

01:36.964 --> 01:38.964
Meg, you don't need
to change the way you look.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.799
You know, most of
the world's problems

01:40.801 --> 01:42.601
stem from poor self-image.

01:42.603 --> 01:44.036
Oh, my God,
what's with Meg's voice?

01:44.038 --> 01:45.504
She sounds like someone

01:45.506 --> 01:47.372
who's about to give up
a huge opportunity.

01:47.374 --> 01:48.841
That's nothing.
Look at you.

01:48.843 --> 01:51.777
You look like a prize at some
Mexican church carnival.

01:51.779 --> 01:52.978
Excellent.

01:52.980 --> 01:54.680
The mind control device
is nearing completion.

01:54.682 --> 01:57.182
Stewie, I said
no toys at the table.

01:57.184 --> 01:58.450
Damn you, vile woman!

01:58.452 --> 01:59.985
You've impeded my work
since the day

01:59.987 --> 02:02.121
I escaped from
your wretched womb.

02:02.123 --> 02:03.455
Oh, don't pout, honey.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.191
You know, when you were born,
the doctor said you were

02:06.193 --> 02:08.827
the happiest looking baby
he'd ever seen.

02:08.829 --> 02:09.828
But of course.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.096
That was my victory day.

02:11.098 --> 02:12.998
The fruition
of my deeply-laid plans

02:13.000 --> 02:16.001
to escape from that cursed
ovarian bastille.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.369
Return the device, woman!

02:17.371 --> 02:19.505
Geez. What, did you carry
a thesaurus around with you?

02:19.507 --> 02:21.306
You know, it's amazing
I could speak at all

02:21.308 --> 02:23.142
with that circumcision
still healing.

02:23.144 --> 02:24.009
Hey, wait a minute, Stewie.

02:24.011 --> 02:25.144
That's the spot!

02:25.146 --> 02:26.645
That's where I buried
my tennis ball!

02:26.647 --> 02:27.679
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:27.681 --> 02:28.680
Brian, what
are you doing?

02:28.682 --> 02:29.948
You can't dig
it up here.

02:29.950 --> 02:31.950
Just make a mental note
of where you buried it,

02:31.952 --> 02:33.152
and as soon as we're
back in the present,

02:33.154 --> 02:34.119
you can dig it up then.

02:34.121 --> 02:35.821
Why?
Because we can't risk

02:35.823 --> 02:37.623
doing anything that
alters the past.

02:37.625 --> 02:38.991
You know, I never got that.

02:38.993 --> 02:41.293
I mean, w-wouldn't you want
to alter the past?

02:41.295 --> 02:43.595
I mean, you could make life
better for yourself.

02:43.597 --> 02:45.664
And not just for yourself,
for everyone.

02:45.666 --> 02:47.599
You-You could stop 9/11.

02:47.601 --> 02:50.102
Brian, there's one rule
of time travel, and that is:

02:50.104 --> 02:52.137
Do not alter the past in any way

02:52.139 --> 02:53.872
or the consequences
could be dire.

02:53.874 --> 02:54.873
Yeah, where'd
you hear that?

02:54.875 --> 02:56.141
<i>Quantum Leap.</i>

02:56.143 --> 02:57.976
That guy changed the past
all the time!

02:57.978 --> 02:59.344
BRIAN:
Whoa, ass ahoy.

03:00.446 --> 03:01.647
Hey, Peter, it's 7:00

03:01.649 --> 03:03.115
and you've still
got your pants on.

03:03.117 --> 03:04.116
What's the occasion?

03:04.118 --> 03:05.250
Ew, I remember this.

03:05.252 --> 03:07.152
Peter's eye did
that weird creepy thing

03:07.154 --> 03:08.854
where it went
over his nose.

03:08.856 --> 03:10.822
Come on, you're
worrying about nothing.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.658
Oh? Remember when
you got drunk

03:12.660 --> 03:14.326
off the communion wine
at church?

03:14.328 --> 03:15.527
STEWIE:
Ah! Ew! Gross!

03:15.529 --> 03:16.528
Look at that.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.964
Wait, what are
they doing?

03:18.966 --> 03:20.098
I don't know.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.967
They're just standing there
like zombies.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.669
Do you think
they're all right?

03:23.671 --> 03:26.104
I-I'm not sure.

03:26.106 --> 03:28.874
And then there was that time
at the ice cream store.

03:30.810 --> 03:32.211
They're doing it again.
What the hell?

03:32.213 --> 03:33.512
I-I'm at a loss.

03:33.514 --> 03:35.314
I mean, I know we're not
supposed to mess with

03:35.316 --> 03:37.916
the timeline, but should
we call an ambulance?

03:37.918 --> 03:41.653
That is so creepy.

03:41.655 --> 03:43.522
And remember you had
an Irish coffee

03:43.524 --> 03:46.091
the day we went
to see <i>Philadelphia?</i>

03:46.093 --> 03:48.460
Oh. They're do-- they're
setting up (bleep) cutaways.

03:48.462 --> 03:50.495
Oh, my God, is that
what we did back then?

03:50.497 --> 03:52.030
Yeah, I mean,
now, we just like

03:52.032 --> 03:54.366
return text messages
and screw around and whatnot.

03:54.368 --> 03:56.535
Lois, I'm not going
back to work tomorrow.

03:56.537 --> 03:58.170
That new boss
has it in for me.

03:58.172 --> 04:00.872
He's meaner than
a shifty salesman.

04:07.847 --> 04:09.381
You sure you got time
to smoke?

04:09.383 --> 04:10.983
Oh, yeah,
it's an Al Harrington.

04:10.985 --> 04:12.351
It goes on for a while.

04:12.353 --> 04:14.620
All right, look, we found out
where your ball is buried.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.088
Now let's get back
to our own time.

04:16.090 --> 04:17.522
Okay, get the return pad.
Let's go.

04:17.524 --> 04:18.757
Not out here
in the open.

04:18.759 --> 04:19.958
Someone could see us.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.660
Remember? No altering
the timeline?

04:21.662 --> 04:23.962
Come on, let's
get up to my room.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.931
Hey, wait a minute, Stewie,
I got to take a leak.

04:25.933 --> 04:27.366
Will it screw up
the timeline

04:27.368 --> 04:29.434
if my future pee goes
in a past toilet?

04:29.436 --> 04:31.670
Uh, no, as long as
it goes in the toilet.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.338
One splash on
a magazine in there,

04:33.340 --> 04:36.074
and we're getting
chased by dinosaurs.

04:37.644 --> 04:39.645
Huh. Looks more or less
the same.

04:39.647 --> 04:41.847
Oh, my God, my Japanese
children's books.

04:41.849 --> 04:43.248
I forgot about these.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.916
<i>You Poop Now.</i>

04:44.918 --> 04:47.019
<i>Horton Hears a Suicide.</i>

04:47.021 --> 04:49.988
<i>The Little Engine That Will,</i>
<i>Or Get Great Shame.</i>

04:49.990 --> 04:50.989
Oh, there you are.

04:50.991 --> 04:51.990
All right,
come on, Brian.

04:51.992 --> 04:52.958
Let's get
out of here.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.293
STEWIE:
Blast, that draggle-tailed,

04:54.295 --> 04:55.927
blunt-edged,
matriarchal despot!

04:55.929 --> 04:57.963
Who the deuce
does she think she is?!

04:57.965 --> 04:59.097
Quick, Brian, hide!

05:00.667 --> 05:03.935
I shall cleverly disguise this
lethal plasma disruptor device

05:03.937 --> 05:06.104
as a tuna fish sandwich,
whereupon I shall end

05:06.106 --> 05:08.874
that wretched woman's
Draconian reign of tyranny!

05:11.144 --> 05:11.977
(sneezes)

05:11.979 --> 05:13.879
(gasps)

05:16.816 --> 05:18.417
Oh. Hey.

05:18.419 --> 05:19.851
Who the deuce
are you?

05:19.853 --> 05:22.954
Uh, well, I'm, uh...
I'm you.

05:22.956 --> 05:25.624
You look like me, but
that's utterly impossible.

05:25.626 --> 05:27.092
I'm afraid it's true.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.260
I'm you from the future.

05:28.262 --> 05:29.528
I've traveled back in time.

05:29.530 --> 05:30.929
That's absurd.

05:30.931 --> 05:33.131
Look, I can prove to you
that I'm you from the future.

05:33.133 --> 05:35.934
I know about
the Eddie Bauer catalog.

05:35.936 --> 05:37.536
(gasps)
It is you!

05:37.538 --> 05:39.538
Okay, bye, Lois.

05:39.540 --> 05:42.040
I'm going to the stag party.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.542
Brian, you might as well
come out now.

05:43.544 --> 05:44.776
He knows everything.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.511
(screams)

05:46.513 --> 05:48.146
(grunts)

05:48.148 --> 05:49.348
Uh-oh.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.967
Brian, are you
all right?

06:08.969 --> 06:09.968
Yeah, I'm fine.

06:09.970 --> 06:10.969
Where'd you get that?

06:10.971 --> 06:12.003
The Stewie from
the past has

06:12.005 --> 06:13.872
a lot more gadgets
and things than I do.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.207
I've kind of slacked
off a little bit.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.142
How's the party?
Looks like fun.

06:17.144 --> 06:19.111
Hey, who wants to play
"Drink the Beer"?

06:19.113 --> 06:20.112
Right here.

06:20.114 --> 06:21.480
You win!

06:21.482 --> 06:23.515
All right!
What do I win?
Another beer!

06:23.517 --> 06:26.485
Okay, take a last look,
'cause we're out of here.

06:26.487 --> 06:27.953
Oh, look at that.

06:27.955 --> 06:29.955
There's the old gang
we've gotten to know

06:29.957 --> 06:31.423
so well over the years.

06:33.960 --> 06:36.061
TV's not even
plugged in.

06:40.633 --> 06:41.633
(crowd cheering)

06:41.635 --> 06:42.634
What is this?

06:42.636 --> 06:43.969
Where the
hell are we?

06:43.971 --> 06:45.504
JOHN MADDEN (over P.A.):
The air is electric

06:45.506 --> 06:47.839
here at Super Bowl 33 tonight.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.541
Stewie, what's
going on?
I don't know.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.976
For some reason,
the time machine

06:50.978 --> 06:52.110
didn't take us
back to the present.

06:52.112 --> 06:53.545
We're still in 1999.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.147
Wait a minute.
I remember this.

06:55.149 --> 06:57.182
I think I'm up
in that blimp.

06:59.152 --> 07:01.086
Amazing. You can
barely drive a car,

07:01.088 --> 07:02.954
and yet you were
allowed to fly a blimp?

07:02.956 --> 07:04.089
Yeah, America's
great, isn't it?

07:04.091 --> 07:05.257
'Cept for the South.

07:05.259 --> 07:08.126
Oh, no wonder the return pad
didn't take us all the way.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.795
The batteries
are almost depleted.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.096
Are those D batteries?

07:11.098 --> 07:12.764
Yes, ever since we had
that trouble in Germany,

07:12.766 --> 07:13.965
I found a way to convert it

07:13.967 --> 07:16.101
so it takes D batteries
instead of uranium.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.336
Only problem is, I didn't
bring any cash with me.

07:18.338 --> 07:19.638
Did you?

07:19.640 --> 07:21.106
I don't think that's
gonna be a problem.

07:22.675 --> 07:24.409
Oh, my God!
Quick, grab some money!

07:26.345 --> 07:28.113
Do you, do you
have pockets?

07:28.115 --> 07:29.781
Are you putting that
in pockets?

07:29.783 --> 07:30.982
That's so cute.

07:32.185 --> 07:34.986
(clamoring)

07:34.988 --> 07:37.088
JOHN MADDEN (over P.A.):
The crowd is storming the field!

07:37.090 --> 07:38.490
This is pandemonium!

07:39.859 --> 07:43.094
(gunfire)

07:43.096 --> 07:44.863
(air hissing)

07:47.834 --> 07:49.668
(both scream)

07:51.304 --> 07:53.371
Quick, Brian, get on!

07:59.045 --> 08:00.846
BRIAN:
Whoa, crash ahoy.

08:04.350 --> 08:07.152
Oh, God!
Now where are we?

08:08.921 --> 08:12.357
Well, you know, I figured
the sooner I cashed the check,

08:12.359 --> 08:14.259
the sooner they'd, uh,
catch their mistake.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.827
(chuckles)

08:15.829 --> 08:17.762
Look, why are we making
a federal case out of this?

08:17.764 --> 08:19.030
Oh, man, this
is the day

08:19.032 --> 08:20.999
Peter went to court
for his welfare fraud.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.334
(coughing)

08:24.136 --> 08:25.136
Hey.

08:25.138 --> 08:26.872
Huh? Oh, hey.

08:26.874 --> 08:27.939
You're the Kool-Aid Guy.

08:27.941 --> 08:28.974
Yeah.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.141
What are you doing?

08:30.143 --> 08:31.276
Just waiting.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.344
For what?

08:32.346 --> 08:33.979
I'm just waiting,
dude-- relax.

08:33.981 --> 08:36.248
Hey, is there any place around
here that sells batteries?

08:36.250 --> 08:37.616
Guys, d-don't
distract me, all right?

08:37.618 --> 08:39.084
I gotta really be up.

08:39.086 --> 08:42.087
Mr. Griffin, I think your
words have touched us all.

08:42.089 --> 08:44.756
I'm sentencing you
to 24 months in prison!

08:44.758 --> 08:45.957
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.559
Oh, no!
Oh, no!

08:49.996 --> 08:51.963
So there's no organs
or glands or anything, right?

08:51.965 --> 08:53.131
It's just the liquid?

08:53.133 --> 08:54.499
Yeah. Yeah, it's
just the liquid.

08:54.501 --> 08:57.002
Um, I don't know
if this is a weird question,

08:57.004 --> 08:59.004
but... can I have some?

08:59.006 --> 09:00.539
All right, fine.
Tilt your head back,

09:00.541 --> 09:02.607
and I'll lean my liquid
down into your mouth.

09:02.609 --> 09:04.109
Oh, now I don't want it.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.343
Oh, crap!
Did I miss it?!

09:05.345 --> 09:08.713
Look, my husband may be
a bit thoughtless at times;

09:08.715 --> 09:11.783
he may even be downright,
well, stupid,

09:11.785 --> 09:15.320
but I know he only accepted
that money because he...

09:15.322 --> 09:18.056
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah! Yeah!

09:28.034 --> 09:29.501
You guys did this!

09:29.503 --> 09:31.202
You guys (bleep) did this!

09:31.204 --> 09:32.604
Talking about my guts?!

09:32.606 --> 09:34.172
(bleep) me up?!
(bleep) you!

09:39.845 --> 09:41.012
Okay, this is good.

09:41.014 --> 09:42.280
We got the
D batteries.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.448
Let's get back
to the present.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.083
All right, get on.

09:51.457 --> 09:53.091
(sighs)
We made it.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.426
Yeah, the Super Bowl
was cool,

09:54.428 --> 09:57.362
but frankly, no Tommy Brady,
no Stewie likey.

09:57.364 --> 09:58.830
Brian, there you are!

09:58.832 --> 10:00.198
Come quick,
they're about to announce

10:00.200 --> 10:02.434
the unveiling of
your statue on the news.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.002
Statue?! For what?

10:04.004 --> 10:05.937
What do you think,
Mr. National Hero?

10:05.939 --> 10:09.808
For stopping the 9/11 terrorist
attacks and saving our country.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.009
Oh, you--

10:11.011 --> 10:14.546
I can't even express
how mad I am at you right now.

10:14.548 --> 10:15.914
If it wasn't for you,

10:15.916 --> 10:18.249
those planes would've hit
the World Trade Center.

10:18.251 --> 10:20.018
Brian, what the hell
did you do?!

10:20.020 --> 10:23.788
I, uh, may have told my
former self about 9/11.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.824
What did I tell you
about altering the past?!

10:25.826 --> 10:27.359
Wait-Wait, when did you
even do that?

10:27.361 --> 10:29.594
Well, you remember when I said
I was going to take a leak?

10:29.596 --> 10:30.929
Brian, you shouldn't
have done that.

10:30.931 --> 10:33.798
Who knows what unforeseen
consequences are awaiting us.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.500
Saddam Hussein
could be president.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.969
Mexico could be the world's
dominant super power.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.971
Cookie Monster could have
invented Facebook!

10:39.973 --> 10:41.673
What is this?

10:41.675 --> 10:43.141
Cookiebook.

10:43.143 --> 10:43.942
LOIS:
Brian!

10:43.944 --> 10:45.577
Hurry, it's starting!

10:47.446 --> 10:48.513
Good evening.
I'm Tom Tucker.

10:48.515 --> 10:49.914
And I'm Joyce Kinney.

10:49.916 --> 10:52.817
Our top story: Quahog prepares
to unveil a new statue

10:52.819 --> 10:54.819
commemorating perhaps
its greatest hero ever.

10:54.821 --> 10:56.321
That's right, Tom.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.024
It was ten years ago that an
almost inconceivable plot

10:59.026 --> 11:00.792
to destroy the
World Trade Center

11:00.794 --> 11:03.461
was thwarted by Quahog's
own Brian Griffin.

11:03.463 --> 11:05.930
This amateur video
captured Griffin's heroism

11:05.932 --> 11:08.500
in the face of a shadowy
terrorist organization called--

11:08.502 --> 11:10.502
holy (bleep),
look at all those vowels--

11:10.504 --> 11:13.872
Al Qua-aye-eeda.

11:13.874 --> 11:16.041
Here.
Make sure you get all this.

11:16.043 --> 11:18.009
(indistinct shouting)

11:18.011 --> 11:21.046
Time to terrorize
the terrorists.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.415
Ugh. You prepared
catchphrases for yourself?

11:23.417 --> 11:25.483
No. Not necessarily.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.854
Mohammed Atta stayed home.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.122
Nobody knows
that guy's name yet.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.725
You're using information
that nobody knows.

11:34.994 --> 11:37.295
Houston, we have a solution.

11:37.297 --> 11:40.031
Houston's for space,
not everyday air travel.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.500
Tell them to ground every plane
out of the East Coast.

11:42.502 --> 11:44.002
Seacrest out.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.071
(passengers cheering)

11:48.140 --> 11:49.874
Wow. What a hero.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.509
Coming up next in sports:

11:51.511 --> 11:53.344
Arizona Cardinal
Pat Tillman

11:53.346 --> 11:55.280
tackled by his own team?

11:55.282 --> 11:56.948
Oh, Brian,
we're so proud of you.

11:56.950 --> 11:58.083
Yeah, buddy.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.651
Great job stopping
those terrorists.

11:59.653 --> 12:01.186
And thank God
their follow-up attack

12:01.188 --> 12:03.154
on St. Louis was a bust.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.157
MAN:
<i>We missed!</i>

12:06.159 --> 12:09.127
Brian, I promise you,
all of this can only end badly.

12:09.129 --> 12:10.261
Stewie, it's fine.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.796
I prevented 9/11.

12:11.798 --> 12:13.598
How could that possibly
be a bad thing?

12:13.600 --> 12:15.934
I mean, come on, I-I
saved, like, 200 lives.

12:15.936 --> 12:17.001
3,000.

12:17.003 --> 12:18.369
Wow! 3,000?!

12:18.371 --> 12:20.505
Oh, you knew what you
were doing there.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.540
TOM: This major
breaking news just in.

12:22.542 --> 12:24.008
Nine Southern states
have declared

12:24.010 --> 12:26.111
that they are seceding
from the United States.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.980
from former President
George W. Bush,

12:28.982 --> 12:30.582
who reformed
the Confederacy

12:30.584 --> 12:33.918
after a bitter loss in
his 2004 reelection bid.

12:33.920 --> 12:35.620
Bush lost in 2004?

12:35.622 --> 12:36.821
Yeah, he probably
couldn't

12:36.823 --> 12:38.957
exploit people's
fears with no 9/11.

12:38.959 --> 12:40.091
Bush appeared
before the press today

12:40.093 --> 12:41.826
to make this brief statement.

12:41.828 --> 12:42.927
If anyone out there can get

12:42.929 --> 12:44.863
their hands
on a clown's suitcase,

12:44.865 --> 12:47.132
I'd very much like to see
what's inside of there.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.467
I think we have the wrong clip.

12:49.469 --> 12:51.936
What? No?

12:51.938 --> 12:53.605
It... this...?

12:53.607 --> 12:55.807
Uh, okay,
that was George W. Bush

12:55.809 --> 12:58.009
declaring civil war
on the Northern states.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.944
Oh, my God!
Civil war?

12:59.946 --> 13:01.479
See, Brian?

13:01.481 --> 13:02.914
This is exactly
what I was talking about.

13:02.916 --> 13:04.349
Look, Stewie, this
doesn't necessarily mean

13:04.351 --> 13:06.084
things are going
to turn out badly.

13:06.086 --> 13:07.685
In fact, I bet, five
years from now,

13:07.687 --> 13:10.088
the world will still be
better off for what I did.

13:10.090 --> 13:11.156
Is that so?

13:11.158 --> 13:13.024
Well, Brian, if you're
that sure of yourself,

13:13.026 --> 13:15.026
then let's go five years
into the future,

13:15.028 --> 13:17.095
and you can prove me wrong.
Fine.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.941
Wow. This is
the future?

13:29.943 --> 13:32.143
Everything
looks slicker.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.945
Hey, Lois, I found some
double-sided tape.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.814
I think I can do about
seven minutes worth

13:35.816 --> 13:37.148
of funny stuff
with it.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.950
That should get us to the
Meg kissing booth story.

13:38.952 --> 13:41.686
Wow. Things have gotten
kind of lazy, huh?

13:41.688 --> 13:43.021
Hey, Peter.

13:43.023 --> 13:44.923
Thanks for letting me
borrow your screwdriver set.

13:44.925 --> 13:47.592
You know, I just want to say
how nice it is

13:47.594 --> 13:49.994
to be back here with y'all
on Spooner Street.

13:49.996 --> 13:52.363
Oh, I guess things
didn't work out in Virginia.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.799
Chris, I heard you got a
"D" on your report card.

13:54.801 --> 13:56.000
Here's a cutaway.

13:56.002 --> 13:58.937
Matthew McConaughey is terrible.

13:58.939 --> 14:00.038
Good Lord!
What's happened to us?

14:00.040 --> 14:01.940
Okay, maybe things
seem a little off,

14:01.942 --> 14:03.942
but other than that,
the world seems okay.

14:03.944 --> 14:05.143
Which proves my point.

14:05.145 --> 14:08.012
Me stopping 9/11 led to a
world that's just fine.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.048
Well, I'll see y'all tomorrow.

14:11.584 --> 14:14.352
(heavy gunfire,
explosions booming)

14:17.456 --> 14:20.124
Brian, you might want
to look outside.

14:20.126 --> 14:22.093
Oh, my God!

14:27.366 --> 14:30.335
(Cleveland screaming)

14:30.337 --> 14:32.136
Oh, oh! Pebble in my shoe!

14:32.138 --> 14:34.873
Pebble in my shoe.
Pebble in my shoe.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.174
Nice work, Bri.

14:36.176 --> 14:38.009
Whoops.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.345
Well, at least Joe
gets to be a cyborg.

14:42.481 --> 14:45.016
(mechanical whirring)

14:47.586 --> 14:49.020
Freeze, Frogmire.

14:49.022 --> 14:50.955
You are out past curfew,

14:50.957 --> 14:53.658
and therefore, in violation
of local ordinance.

14:53.660 --> 14:54.726
Ribbity.

15:02.635 --> 15:03.935
What the hell happened?

15:03.937 --> 15:06.004
Could I really have
caused all this?

15:06.006 --> 15:08.206
It says here that the new
American civil war

15:08.208 --> 15:10.441
you set into motion
ended up in a series

15:10.443 --> 15:13.478
of concentrated nuclear strikes
all along the Eastern Seaboard.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.947
It killed 17 million people.

15:15.949 --> 15:16.948
Oh.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.783
Including
Cesar Millan.
No!

15:18.785 --> 15:20.618
Okay, okay, I get it--
Stewie, I screwed up.

15:20.620 --> 15:22.153
All right? I shouldn't
have altered the past.

15:22.155 --> 15:23.588
Is there anything
we can do?

15:23.590 --> 15:25.657
Well, the only way
to fix this is to return

15:25.659 --> 15:27.959
to the moment when we
first arrived in the past

15:27.961 --> 15:30.161
and stop you from spilling
the beans about 9/11.

15:30.163 --> 15:32.063
Okay. Okay,
let's do it.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.003
BRIAN (inside house):
Whoa, ass ahoy.

15:39.005 --> 15:40.538
All right, look,
there we are.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.106
BRIAN: Hey, uh,
Peter, it's 7:00

15:42.108 --> 15:43.374
and you've still
got your pants on.

15:43.376 --> 15:44.375
What's the
occasion?

15:44.377 --> 15:45.376
Stop!
Both of you!

15:45.378 --> 15:46.678
What the hell?
Who are you?

15:46.680 --> 15:48.146
We're you,
from the future.

15:48.148 --> 15:49.814
Oh, boy, this can't
be good news.

15:49.816 --> 15:51.516
Who screwed up?
Take a wild guess.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.818
What did I do?
Well, nothing yet,
but listen.

15:53.820 --> 15:55.286
Whatever you do,
you cannot tell

15:55.288 --> 15:57.989
your former self--
that Brian-- about 9/11.

15:57.991 --> 16:00.992
If you do, America as you
know it will cease to exist.

16:00.994 --> 16:02.160
My God, Brian.
What the hell?

16:02.162 --> 16:03.328
We've been here
two minutes,

16:03.330 --> 16:05.096
and already you've
destroyed America.

16:05.098 --> 16:07.031
Okay, okay. I promise
I won't say anything.

16:07.033 --> 16:10.101
Also, if you don't give
that Stewie a back rub,

16:10.103 --> 16:12.070
it really messes
everything up.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.441
All right,
can we go now?

16:21.146 --> 16:22.480
Did that do it?

16:22.482 --> 16:23.748
Did we restore
the past?

16:23.750 --> 16:24.749
Well, let's check.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.251
"9/11."

16:27.253 --> 16:28.653
Oh, there it is.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.088
We did it, Brian.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.255
We made 9/11 happen.

16:31.257 --> 16:32.623
High five! All right!
All right!

16:32.625 --> 16:34.125
Yeah!
High five!

16:34.127 --> 16:35.026
Wow, that...
that probably

16:35.028 --> 16:36.861
wouldn't look very good
out of context.

16:36.863 --> 16:39.464
There's the writer
of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series.

16:39.466 --> 16:42.300
Must be weird hanging out
with us Muggles, huh, Brian?

16:42.302 --> 16:43.334
Yeah.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.036
Well, laundrium insertum.

16:45.038 --> 16:46.504
Huh? (chuckles)

16:46.506 --> 16:47.972
Oh, my God.

16:47.974 --> 16:49.340
All right, you obviously
have no self-control,

16:49.342 --> 16:52.076
so we've got to go back
and do this again.

16:54.279 --> 16:55.279
BRIAN:
Whoa, ass ahoy.

16:55.281 --> 16:56.247
All right, let's go.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.515
Hey, uh, Peter,
it's 7:00

16:57.517 --> 16:59.083
and you've still
got your pants on.

16:59.085 --> 17:00.618
Oh, yeah, that's right.
We were just here.

17:00.620 --> 17:01.953
BRIAN and STEWIE:
Wait!

17:01.955 --> 17:03.621
Who the devil
are you?

17:03.623 --> 17:05.089
We're from the future.
So are we.

17:05.091 --> 17:06.491
We're from
the further future.

17:06.493 --> 17:07.692
We came to stop you.

17:07.694 --> 17:08.926
Why?
What they did

17:08.928 --> 17:10.962
actually turns out
to be damage-free.

17:10.964 --> 17:12.764
It's what you're about to do--
stopping them--

17:12.766 --> 17:14.532
that causes utter bedlam.

17:14.534 --> 17:15.967
Oh, come on.

17:15.969 --> 17:17.135
Wait!
Stop!

17:17.137 --> 17:18.936
We're from the further
further future.

17:18.938 --> 17:20.938
What you guys do
eventually works out.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.774
It's what you two
are about to do

17:22.776 --> 17:24.142
that ruins everything!

17:24.144 --> 17:25.209
Stop!
Don't do anything!

17:25.211 --> 17:26.644
Oh, for
God's sake.

17:26.646 --> 17:28.546
We're from the further
further further future.

17:28.548 --> 17:29.981
What these two do
is fine.

17:29.983 --> 17:33.017
It's what you two do
that makes things worse.

17:33.019 --> 17:34.018
Stop!
Wait!
Hold it!

17:34.020 --> 17:35.520
Stop!
Wait!
No!

17:35.522 --> 17:36.754
Hold it!
Stop!

17:36.756 --> 17:37.922
I don't know what
I'm doing here.

17:37.924 --> 17:38.923
I'm just looking
for the can.

17:38.925 --> 17:40.091
Don't move!
Hold it!

17:40.093 --> 17:41.092
Freeze!
Stop!

17:41.094 --> 17:42.293
Wait!
No!

17:42.295 --> 17:43.795
Oh, for God's sake, why?

17:43.797 --> 17:44.929
This is why!

17:44.931 --> 17:46.330
Don't move!
Hold it!

17:46.332 --> 17:47.532
Freeze!
Stop!

17:47.534 --> 17:49.033
No!
Wait!

17:49.035 --> 17:50.935
Oh, my God.
What's that?

17:50.937 --> 17:52.437
I don't know
what happened.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.305
This is life
for some reason.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.174
Don't do whatever
you're about to do.

17:56.176 --> 17:57.508
God help us.

17:57.510 --> 17:59.477
This is no
way to live.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.013
(both retching)

18:02.015 --> 18:03.948
(all talking and shouting
at once)

18:03.950 --> 18:05.983
No, don't do it!
Halt!

18:06.952 --> 18:10.421
(confused clamoring continues)

18:15.360 --> 18:19.030
All right, everybody,
shut the hell up!

18:19.032 --> 18:21.099
All right, this is (bleep),
all right?

18:21.101 --> 18:22.533
I can't follow
what's going on anymore,

18:22.535 --> 18:24.702
and I'm assuming
the rest of you can't, either.

18:24.704 --> 18:26.704
So let's make this easy
and take a vote.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.673
How many think
we should prevent 9/11?

18:28.675 --> 18:31.142
Raise your hands.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.144
One, two, three, four, five
six, seven, eight, nine...

18:33.146 --> 18:34.779
Okay, all right, looks like 42.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.514
All right, who votes "yes 9/11?"

18:38.350 --> 18:40.451
(muttering, counting rapidly)

18:40.453 --> 18:41.752
Okay, all right, 57.

18:41.754 --> 18:42.987
All right, 9/11 wins.

18:42.989 --> 18:44.522
Wait, wait, shouldn't it
be an even number?

18:44.524 --> 18:46.124
Why is the total
an odd number?

18:46.126 --> 18:47.992
Oh, yeah, I think one
of the Brians died.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.961
What? What do you mean?
I don't know-- one of them

18:49.963 --> 18:51.262
landed here
with its throat slit.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.030
But wait,
if one of me is dead,

18:53.032 --> 18:54.432
then shouldn't all
the me's be dead?

18:54.434 --> 18:56.367
Brian, I-I don't...
I... it's...

18:56.369 --> 18:57.969
I don't... I don't
know anymore. I-I...

18:57.971 --> 18:59.704
You know what?
I guess not. A-All right?

18:59.706 --> 19:01.839
Okay, listen up--
everybody, get back

19:01.841 --> 19:03.975
in your individual time machines
very carefully.

19:03.977 --> 19:05.376
Nobody touch anything.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.844
No <i>Harry Potter</i> novels.

19:06.846 --> 19:08.146
Don't step on a bug.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.081
Don't give earlier yous
investment advice.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.917
Just go back to where you
came from, and stay there!

19:31.970 --> 19:33.137
There.

19:33.139 --> 19:34.438
Now, we're going
to do what we

19:34.440 --> 19:36.007
should have done
in the first place.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.542
Get on.

19:40.479 --> 19:42.947
Wait a minute.
Isn't this where we just were?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.015
Where are
the other two us's?

19:44.017 --> 19:45.583
They're not here yet.

19:45.585 --> 19:47.852
Just to make sure there are
absolutely no loose ends,

19:47.854 --> 19:49.754
I've sent us back in time
to the moment

19:49.756 --> 19:51.789
just before you and I
originally arrived.

19:51.791 --> 19:53.457
Why?
You'll see.

19:53.459 --> 19:55.459
Get the (bleep) back
in your time machine!

19:55.461 --> 19:56.994
Aah!
Who are you?

19:56.996 --> 19:57.995
Never mind who I am!

19:57.997 --> 19:59.664
Just get back
in your time machine,

19:59.666 --> 20:01.532
get back to the present,
and stay there!

20:01.534 --> 20:03.434
Look, just calm down.
Aah!

20:03.436 --> 20:05.436
You gonna flap your lips
or you gonna do what I said?

20:05.438 --> 20:06.637
Okay, okay!

20:06.639 --> 20:08.673
All right! God!

20:08.675 --> 20:09.941
You just talked
to yourself.

20:09.943 --> 20:11.309
Won't that
alter the past?

20:11.311 --> 20:12.777
Don't worry, Brian.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.845
If I was successful
in restoring the past just now,

20:14.847 --> 20:16.514
you and I will never
have existed.

20:16.516 --> 20:18.349
The chronological tangent
that created us

20:18.351 --> 20:19.517
will have been erased.

20:19.519 --> 20:21.485
Oh. Is it going to hurt?

20:21.487 --> 20:23.421
Just a little.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.156
Ow.

20:31.830 --> 20:33.331
Oh, God, my leg
is killing me.

20:33.333 --> 20:34.765
Well, time travel
is risky.

20:34.767 --> 20:36.534
Every time you step
into that machine,

20:36.536 --> 20:37.768
you invite the
possibility

20:37.770 --> 20:39.537
of altering the
world as we know it.

20:39.539 --> 20:40.972
Thankfully, the
alternate versions of us

20:40.974 --> 20:42.440
were there to prevent
us from doing

20:42.442 --> 20:43.808
whatever it is we
apparently did.

20:43.810 --> 20:45.476
I wonder what it was.
We'll never know.

20:45.478 --> 20:46.844
But look on the
bright side.

20:46.846 --> 20:48.980
You might be sitting here
with a hole in your leg,

20:48.982 --> 20:51.115
but at least our present
universe hasn't been affected.

20:51.117 --> 20:52.683
PETER: Sorry, guys.
I'm gonna need the couch.

20:52.685 --> 20:54.585
The gang and I
are gonna watch the game.

20:54.587 --> 20:56.120
All right, let's unplug
the TV and get going.
