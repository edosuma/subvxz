[Shiro]
<i>Okay, look.</i>

01:06.233 --> 01:09.987
I now know for certain that Zarkon
is tracking us through the Black Lion.

01:10.153 --> 01:11.989
We have to find some way to stop him.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.448
How are we gonna do that?

01:13.615 --> 01:17.911
We've never had this situation before.
Two paladins battling for the same lion.

01:17.995 --> 01:22.332
Well, unless we want Zarkon taking control
of Voltron every time we get close...

01:22.499 --> 01:24.876
I'll have to forge a new bond
with my lion.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.670
One that's stronger than his.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.297
Well, while you're working on that...

01:28.463 --> 01:30.716
the rest of us need to find
some new teludav lenses...

01:30.882 --> 01:33.427
otherwise we won't be able
to travel via wormhole.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.847
-Is that something we have to mail order?
-Does anyone even make those anymore?

01:37.014 --> 01:38.140
[Allura]
I don't know.

01:38.307 --> 01:41.977
Only a few Alteans could use
the teludav 10,000 ago.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.104
They may not exist anymore.

01:45.689 --> 01:48.442
I think I may know where we can get some.

01:53.238 --> 01:54.531
Coran!

01:54.698 --> 01:57.868
You're not suggesting going
to one of those filthy swap moons!

01:58.035 --> 01:59.995
The last time you went,
those space pirates

02:00.078 --> 02:01.663
took you for everything you had.

02:01.830 --> 02:03.206
Space pirates?

02:03.582 --> 02:05.167
The Unilu were traders and pirates...

02:05.334 --> 02:08.086
that roamed the galaxies
and dealt in black market goods.

02:08.252 --> 02:12.049
Umvy spice, by-tor water,
little bottles of infinity vapor.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.093
Of course, you had to bargain.
No one could bargain like the Unilu.

02:15.260 --> 02:18.347
Last time, I ended up giving away
three quarters of my shipment of lango...

02:18.513 --> 02:20.641
in exchange for a used pogo oscillator.

02:20.724 --> 02:21.683
[chuckling]

02:21.767 --> 02:23.935
Father was not pleased about that.

02:24.102 --> 02:25.937
Well, while Coran is picking up his
lenses...

02:26.104 --> 02:28.065
I'll take you shopping
for something sparkly.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.691
This isn't shopping!

02:29.775 --> 02:31.151
You're not wandering around saying...

02:31.234 --> 02:34.196
"What a lovely pink hat!
This is so becoming."

02:34.279 --> 02:36.823
No! I can't allow Allura
to get anywhere near those...

02:36.990 --> 02:39.284
filthy, lowballing Unilu hoodlums.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.328
But I'd love something sparkly.

02:42.412 --> 02:44.498
Look, you're the only one
who can operate the Castle.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.376
You need to be resting,
after all you've been through.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.336
Now, let's ready a pod for our mission.

02:49.419 --> 02:50.420
We need to get in...

02:50.504 --> 02:53.006
find the scaultrite lenses,
and just get out.

02:53.173 --> 02:54.216
Shotgun!

02:54.383 --> 02:57.052
What? No, you have to be
in the pod bay to call shotgun.

02:57.219 --> 02:58.470
Since when?

02:58.637 --> 03:00.931
[Hunk] Since forever?
That's shotgun etiquette!

03:01.014 --> 03:02.057
I wrote the book.

03:02.599 --> 03:05.602
While they're doing that,
I'm going to head down to the hangar.

03:05.769 --> 03:08.063
I need to strengthen my bond
with the Black Lion.

03:10.232 --> 03:11.233
[sighing]

03:11.316 --> 03:15.028
So what am I supposed to do now,
sit around and worry all day?

03:15.112 --> 03:16.571
[mice squeaking]

03:17.656 --> 03:21.368
What? Dinner and a show?

03:25.622 --> 03:27.374
You and I have some work to do.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.675
[exhaling]

03:42.723 --> 03:43.932
Work with me.

03:44.015 --> 03:46.643
What do I have to do
to strengthen our bond?

03:49.146 --> 03:50.772
[gasping]

03:51.148 --> 03:52.232
[Shiro] Whoa! Hey!

03:52.315 --> 03:53.525
What are you doing?

03:56.278 --> 03:58.029
Stop. Stop!

03:59.573 --> 04:01.032
I said stop!

04:01.116 --> 04:03.076
Turn around.
That's an order!

04:10.751 --> 04:13.128
[Coran] <i>Hello? Back passengers?</i>
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

04:13.211 --> 04:15.589
[Lance] <i>Oh, it's so comfy up here.</i>

04:15.672 --> 04:17.966
<i>Extra leg-room, heated seats!</i>
<i>Oh, man!</i>

04:18.466 --> 04:21.136
Stupid Lance.
Stupid shotgun.

04:21.219 --> 04:23.764
Now, these swap moons
are very dangerous environments.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.015
So be on your toes.

04:25.182 --> 04:28.018
<i>No weapons or communication devices</i>
<i>of any kind!</i>

04:28.185 --> 04:30.562
<i>Also, I've brought along some disguises.</i>

04:45.535 --> 04:46.620
Coran?

04:46.703 --> 04:50.457
This Unilu swap meet looks
an awful lot like a regular mall.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.126
It does seem to be a little cleaner
than I remember.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.630
Still, be vigilant. The Unilu are
cut-throat wheeler-dealers.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.924
So keep your hands on your coin satchels.

04:59.090 --> 05:00.759
My satchels are empty.

05:00.926 --> 05:01.927
Good.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.678
Let's just get this over with.

05:03.845 --> 05:04.888
Yes, right.

05:05.055 --> 05:08.517
Everyone, let's fan out,
search the area for teludav lenses.

05:08.683 --> 05:11.728
We'll meet by the giant ticking clock
here in one vaga.

05:11.895 --> 05:14.189
Don't be late, and try to blend in.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.614
[screen beeping]

05:25.033 --> 05:26.660
What the...

05:26.743 --> 05:28.161
Space pirates!

05:28.620 --> 05:31.623
Disguising yourselves
as harmless shoppers, huh?

05:31.706 --> 05:33.375
Well, it won't work.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.252
Don't worry, Emperor Zarkon.

05:35.418 --> 05:37.420
I know you can't be here
to protect the mall...

05:37.587 --> 05:40.507
but your faithful number two
is on the case.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.969
Hope you pirates are ready to face Varkon.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.933
[Shiro groaning]
<i>Come on!</i>

05:50.016 --> 05:51.685
<i>[groaning]</i>

05:51.768 --> 05:53.186
I don't know where you're headed...

05:53.353 --> 05:55.814
but you need to
start listening to me right now!

06:02.737 --> 06:04.114
That's better.

06:10.620 --> 06:11.997
Where are we?

06:14.457 --> 06:15.792
Why did you bring me here?

06:15.875 --> 06:17.544
What are you trying to tell me?

06:18.211 --> 06:19.379
[gasping]

06:22.132 --> 06:24.801
So you want me to see through your eyes.

06:40.984 --> 06:41.818
[gasping]

06:41.901 --> 06:43.612
Was this your home?

06:52.495 --> 06:56.249
Okay, if I were a 10,000-year-old
wormhole lens, where would I be?

06:57.500 --> 06:59.461
Excuse me, hey, hi, excuse me, hi!

06:59.544 --> 07:01.338
Wow, you guys are really booking here.

07:01.421 --> 07:03.632
So I was just wondering if you guys
knew where I could find...

07:03.798 --> 07:05.550
some lenses for my ship around here?

07:06.301 --> 07:08.762
Is there a one-hour lens place
around here or something?

07:08.928 --> 07:10.931
Anything? Nothing?
Never mind, you know what?

07:11.014 --> 07:13.683
I'll catch up with you guys later!
[panting]

07:16.770 --> 07:18.647
Oh!

07:20.190 --> 07:24.736
This is beautiful!

07:26.446 --> 07:27.489
[chuckling]

07:27.572 --> 07:29.783
Maybe the scaultrite is under
these samples. I don't know.

07:32.827 --> 07:33.954
Rubbery.

07:35.997 --> 07:37.290
Sweet and salty.

07:41.419 --> 07:44.464
So cold, but spicy.

07:46.216 --> 07:47.425
Mmm, eh...

07:47.509 --> 07:48.760
What's next, what do you got?

07:48.927 --> 07:50.303
[Vrepit Sal] Five hundred GAC.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.305
Five hundred GAC.
Excuse me?

07:52.389 --> 07:55.850
Sustenance provided by Vrepit Sal,
that's me.

07:56.017 --> 07:58.520
Five hundred GAC is now owed.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.690
I thought this was
a "free sample" situation.

08:01.856 --> 08:02.774
Free?

08:02.941 --> 08:04.067
Of charge.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.318
You know, <i>gratis?</i>

08:06.736 --> 08:07.904
Look, I don't have any money.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.073
So, you know...

08:12.951 --> 08:14.202
Oh, man!

08:15.578 --> 08:17.038
How long you been here?

08:17.205 --> 08:21.376
Sal put me in
when I was just a little girl.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.212
Oh, no!

08:28.299 --> 08:32.886
Let me show you this wonderful workings
of the Galasu X-90 Extreme Blade System.

08:33.054 --> 08:36.808
It slices, it dices, it kills,
slaughters, and skins...

08:36.975 --> 08:38.684
and constantly stays razor sharp!

08:40.186 --> 08:42.856
Look at it cut through this bloato fruit.

08:49.988 --> 08:51.322
Paper thin.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.033
How much would you pay
for this knife?

08:54.200 --> 08:56.369
But wait, there's more!

08:56.536 --> 08:59.497
How many times have you had to fight off
a charging rock monster...

08:59.664 --> 09:01.458
and then go immediately to a picnic?

09:01.624 --> 09:03.043
All the time, right?

09:03.835 --> 09:08.256
The Galasu can cut through rocks
and still cut bloato fruit paper thin.

09:09.424 --> 09:11.509
Now how much would you pay?

09:11.676 --> 09:12.844
Seriously, how much?

09:12.927 --> 09:14.846
I have a lot of these to unload.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.806
I just had a question.

09:16.973 --> 09:18.933
Fine! What do you got?

09:19.017 --> 09:22.020
Have you ever come across
something like this?

09:27.484 --> 09:29.527
Whoa, this craftsmanship is incredible!

09:29.611 --> 09:31.112
And is this a luxite blade?

09:31.196 --> 09:34.574
The planet they mine that from
hasn't existed in decafebes.

09:34.741 --> 09:35.825
Where'd you get this?

09:36.534 --> 09:37.786
Someone gave it to me.

09:37.869 --> 09:39.662
Okay, that's vague.
Tell you what...

09:39.746 --> 09:42.332
I'll give you 1,000 GAC
to take it off your hands.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.000
It's not for sale.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.502
Two thousand.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.962
No, thanks.
Give it back.

09:48.505 --> 09:49.506
How about this?

09:49.589 --> 09:52.258
I keep the knife
and you beat it before security gets here.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.510
I know it's stolen.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.844
It's not stolen.

09:55.011 --> 09:57.097
Then tell me where you got it.

09:57.180 --> 09:58.515
[groaning]

09:59.015 --> 10:00.433
[grunting]

10:04.521 --> 10:06.397
Hey! Come back with that!

10:07.148 --> 10:08.233
[button beeping]

10:08.316 --> 10:09.734
[imitating motorcycle revving]

10:10.985 --> 10:12.529
Trouble at the Slice Capades?

10:13.905 --> 10:15.573
It's one of those pirates!

10:15.657 --> 10:17.617
I knew they looked edgy.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.369
Varkon's comin' for ya!

10:21.788 --> 10:23.873
[hoverbike whirring]

10:28.711 --> 10:31.172
[Shiro]
<i>So this was Zarkon's home planet.</i>

10:32.048 --> 10:33.216
Show me more.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.442
[Shiro] <i>King Alford built you</i>
<i>from that comet.</i>

10:52.318 --> 10:53.945
<i>And you fought beside him.</i>

10:55.572 --> 10:57.157
<i>With Zarkon.</i>

10:58.867 --> 11:00.451
[gasping]

11:06.332 --> 11:07.709
You!

11:13.131 --> 11:14.048
[mice squeaking]

11:29.188 --> 11:30.148
[giggling]

11:30.231 --> 11:31.774
Absolutely stunning!

11:31.941 --> 11:34.736
After we defeat Zarkon,
I'm taking you on the road!

11:34.819 --> 11:35.695
[mice squeaking]

11:43.870 --> 11:46.664
[toilet flushing]

11:49.292 --> 11:50.543
I'll just hold it.

11:57.717 --> 11:58.676
[giggling]

11:58.760 --> 12:02.263
Can I interest you in
the latest Earth fashions?

12:02.805 --> 12:05.642
Lance, come on! We have to be back
at the ticking clock in a half hour.

12:05.808 --> 12:09.020
But Pidge, wait, look at all this
crazy Earth stuff this alien is selling!

12:09.187 --> 12:10.813
We're supposed to be looking
for the teludav lenses...

12:10.980 --> 12:13.608
and you're looking in the one store
we know for certain won't have--

12:13.775 --> 12:17.028
Oh, my gosh!
Is that Killbot Phantasm 1?

12:17.111 --> 12:19.656
The first journey to the depths
of the demon sphere?

12:20.281 --> 12:22.533
Oh! Mercury Gameflux Two!

12:22.700 --> 12:24.577
With the original power glove
that gives you infinite lives

12:24.744 --> 12:26.329
if you touch the index finger
to the pinky!

12:26.412 --> 12:29.290
We have to have this!
How much is this?

12:29.374 --> 12:30.959
Twelve hundred GAC.

12:31.125 --> 12:32.085
Is that a lot?

12:32.251 --> 12:35.964
Well, compared to what we have,
which is none, yes. It's a lot.

12:36.589 --> 12:38.383
We're gonna find some money.
Come on!

12:39.092 --> 12:40.009
Don't sell that!

12:41.344 --> 12:44.555
Don't worry.
I never sell anything.

12:44.639 --> 12:46.724
Do I, Kaltenecker?

12:46.808 --> 12:48.768
[Kaltenecker mooing]

12:50.436 --> 12:52.063
Ah, one of the Unilu.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.359
[whistling]

12:57.485 --> 12:59.320
Like, can I help you?

12:59.487 --> 13:03.282
Yes. Can you tell me
where the "other" market is?

13:03.366 --> 13:04.826
The what?

13:05.410 --> 13:08.871
Well, some might call it
the "black market."

13:09.747 --> 13:13.084
I don't think I know that.
Maybe check there.

13:15.003 --> 13:17.213
I don't think this would be "on" the map.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.924
It might be more "off-book."

13:21.759 --> 13:22.885
Hm?

13:22.969 --> 13:25.304
Maybe this will help you remember?

13:26.806 --> 13:28.558
Again, what?

13:29.517 --> 13:31.686
Ah, the old Unilu shakedown, eh?

13:31.769 --> 13:33.479
[chuckling]
Fine.

13:34.230 --> 13:37.150
Starting to get
a fuzzy recollection yet?

13:38.151 --> 13:39.152
Who is this?

13:39.235 --> 13:41.237
-Is this you?
-No!

13:41.320 --> 13:43.114
That's King Groggery the Infirm!

13:43.614 --> 13:46.200
You know what?
I'll find it myself!

13:46.284 --> 13:48.786
[groaning]
I'm so out of this dump.

13:50.038 --> 13:51.831
I gotta escape somehow.

13:52.540 --> 13:55.001
Maybe I can scrub through these cuffs.

13:57.587 --> 13:58.838
[horn blows]

13:58.921 --> 14:00.548
Forty-three!

14:04.260 --> 14:06.054
Sustenance unit complete.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.556
-Ingest.
-[moaning]

14:08.639 --> 14:11.225
-[explosion]
-Huh?

14:11.309 --> 14:12.727
[robot buzzing]

14:12.935 --> 14:14.312
Oh, not again!

14:14.395 --> 14:16.314
Now who will be
my sustenance preparer?

14:16.481 --> 14:18.858
I got this, Sal.
Un-cuff me.

14:18.941 --> 14:20.151
[chuckling]
You?

14:20.318 --> 14:21.235
Trust me.

14:21.319 --> 14:23.571
I'm an enthusiastic gourmand
with an incredible palate.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.948
Also, your robot is dead on the floor.

14:27.075 --> 14:28.868
That last part is true.

14:30.495 --> 14:32.205
All right, work.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.334
Okay, now watch this!

14:37.418 --> 14:38.878
I can't read this.

14:38.961 --> 14:40.505
Doesn't matter.
I'll just improvise.

14:44.717 --> 14:48.096
Do you smell how the tanginess
of tuber masture really brings out...

14:48.262 --> 14:50.848
the charred flavor
from the palmagoren fillet?

14:51.474 --> 14:53.184
No, no, we won't be using that.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.020
Let's just say,
"Number 44? Your order's up."

14:59.023 --> 15:00.525
Enjoy your meal.

15:02.777 --> 15:04.529
[moaning]

15:05.696 --> 15:08.282
What did you do to her face?
It's cracking!

15:08.366 --> 15:10.910
She's smiling!
She's enjoying her food.

15:13.704 --> 15:16.624
Okay, let's provide some sustenance!

15:21.129 --> 15:22.630
Show me more.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.886
<i>Those wings...</i>

15:29.053 --> 15:31.681
<i>You have powers I haven't unlocked.</i>

15:37.478 --> 15:38.938
<i>Incredible!</i>

15:39.105 --> 15:41.274
I've got you now, paladin.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.528
[screaming]

15:48.364 --> 15:51.492
You are a fool to face me here.

15:51.951 --> 15:56.289
When you die in this realm,
your body dies as well.

15:56.456 --> 16:00.460
And then I will take control of Voltron.

16:01.836 --> 16:03.004
[grunting]

16:07.425 --> 16:09.552
[yelling]

16:10.219 --> 16:12.054
[groaning]

16:15.266 --> 16:16.642
[grunting]

16:22.565 --> 16:24.442
[breathing heavily]

16:26.194 --> 16:27.987
I'll find you pirates!

16:29.614 --> 16:32.325
[hoverbike beeping]

16:33.743 --> 16:35.411
What's going on here?

16:37.121 --> 16:39.707
Official business, excuse me,
this is a fire hazard.

16:39.874 --> 16:41.584
I'm in the middle of a hot pursuit.

16:41.751 --> 16:43.252
I said "over medium".

16:43.336 --> 16:45.254
Over medium, you rube!

16:45.421 --> 16:47.840
Does this look over medium to you?

16:48.007 --> 16:49.509
No, Chef.

16:49.717 --> 16:51.010
Then let's get it right, huh?

16:51.177 --> 16:54.055
If it ain't perfect, it ain't coming out
of this kitchen, people!

16:54.222 --> 16:55.515
Sauce me!

16:55.598 --> 16:56.766
Now you're getting it!

17:02.063 --> 17:03.648
-Bon appétit.
-[applause]

17:04.357 --> 17:05.942
I got you now, pirate!

17:06.025 --> 17:07.026
Where are your friends?

17:07.108 --> 17:08.152
[screaming]

17:08.236 --> 17:09.403
Don't forget what I taught you!

17:09.487 --> 17:11.321
Those are the fundamentals of cooking!

17:14.575 --> 17:17.453
That kid is a genius.

17:17.619 --> 17:20.205
I don't care if we have to search
the entire galaxy!

17:20.373 --> 17:22.833
I want him back at Vrepit Sal's!

17:23.291 --> 17:25.002
[Shiro panting]

17:26.628 --> 17:30.466
You could never take my place
as the head of Voltron.

17:30.675 --> 17:32.176
-[yelling]
-[grunting]

17:35.304 --> 17:38.015
You can't pilot the Black Lion
after everything you've done!

17:38.182 --> 17:40.560
You can never lead Voltron again!

17:40.643 --> 17:42.895
You're no paladin!

17:43.771 --> 17:45.314
[groaning]

17:46.023 --> 17:49.735
You have no idea how to command
a weapon like this!

17:50.319 --> 17:52.822
No one commands the Black Lion!

17:53.281 --> 17:54.282
[grunting]

17:57.201 --> 17:58.828
You dare lecture me?

18:01.872 --> 18:03.749
[gasping]

18:06.836 --> 18:11.549
Do you think the Black Lion would allow
such a feeble creature to pilot it?

18:11.716 --> 18:14.135
Only the powerful can command it.

18:14.302 --> 18:18.431
You've forgotten what's most important
between a lion and its paladin.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.849
It's not about power.

18:19.932 --> 18:22.143
It's about earning each other's trust.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.479
Trust has nothing to do with it.

18:25.646 --> 18:29.191
The lion is mine, forever.

18:29.275 --> 18:31.527
[screaming]

18:36.741 --> 18:37.783
Huh?

18:38.492 --> 18:39.910
[yelling]

18:39.994 --> 18:41.370
No!

18:43.456 --> 18:45.124
Sire, what is it?

18:45.291 --> 18:47.293
My connection grows weaker.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.630
We must hurry
if we ever wish to reclaim Voltron!

18:53.424 --> 18:56.260
Did you just save me?

18:56.344 --> 18:57.386
Thank you.

18:58.471 --> 18:59.639
Let's go home.

18:59.722 --> 19:00.598
[gasping]

19:05.186 --> 19:06.729
We never left.

19:09.774 --> 19:12.485
Oh, this tenner looks like the last one.

19:12.568 --> 19:13.694
So how much have we got?

19:13.778 --> 19:16.364
Eleven hundred and ninety-six GAC.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.074
We're so close!

19:18.240 --> 19:19.492
Lance, look!

19:20.785 --> 19:21.911
Already on it!

19:26.957 --> 19:28.250
Yeah! Let's go!

19:28.334 --> 19:29.710
[laughing]

19:29.794 --> 19:31.128
Thanks!

19:32.213 --> 19:33.964
Gotta hide!
Gotta hide!

19:34.048 --> 19:35.966
[toilet flushing]

19:36.801 --> 19:38.511
Keith! He's right behind me!

19:38.594 --> 19:39.720
Who?

19:39.804 --> 19:42.014
[hoverbike beeping]

19:43.432 --> 19:44.725
Pirate number two!

19:44.809 --> 19:46.143
My lucky day!

19:46.227 --> 19:47.395
[yelping]

19:48.479 --> 19:49.480
Hold on.

19:49.563 --> 19:52.650
With every purchase,
you get a free Kaltenecker.

19:52.817 --> 19:54.151
Time to get moving, guys!

19:54.318 --> 19:55.986
Security's on our tail!

19:56.612 --> 19:58.114
There's the rest of the crew!

19:58.197 --> 19:59.699
[yelping]

20:02.493 --> 20:03.994
[panting]

20:05.705 --> 20:07.123
Everyone up on Kaltenecker!

20:07.289 --> 20:08.499
Did you buy a cow?

20:08.666 --> 20:10.459
It was free with purchase!

20:14.922 --> 20:16.549
[everyone screaming]

20:20.761 --> 20:23.055
Hold on a tick, this looks familiar!

20:23.222 --> 20:24.557
Oh, lookie-lookie.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.684
An original Unilu swap shop!

20:26.767 --> 20:28.185
[sighing]

20:28.978 --> 20:30.146
Good eye, friend.

20:30.229 --> 20:33.190
This shop's been in
my family since before the empire began.

20:33.274 --> 20:35.317
Can I interest you in a butcher barrel?

20:35.401 --> 20:37.403
Or perhaps a set of window breakers?

20:37.486 --> 20:39.238
Teludav lenses! Yes!

20:39.321 --> 20:43.075
I mean, I don't have any idea
what these pieces of junk are.

20:44.660 --> 20:48.831
I see you've got your eye on these
antique glass table toppers here.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.624
Well, they're pretty ugly.

20:50.791 --> 20:53.919
But I do have an empty
curio cabinet for grotesqueries.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.588
How much do you want?

20:56.046 --> 20:57.757
How much have you got?

20:57.923 --> 21:00.092
Oh, I have a handful of pocket lint.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.677
I'll take your first-born child.

21:01.844 --> 21:03.637
I might be able to throw in
a used handkerchief.

21:03.804 --> 21:06.557
-I could accept your left foot.
-I'd be willing to sing you a song!

21:06.724 --> 21:08.184
You become my butler for one year.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.561
-Two Altean crown bills.
-Five Valuvium ingots.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.104
Oh, would you accept an IOU?

21:12.271 --> 21:14.106
Of course.
I'll just need some collateral.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.608
Maybe ten Valuvium ingots!

21:15.691 --> 21:18.778
Or how about this?
One Olkari flying cube.

21:18.944 --> 21:20.613
-You've got a deal!
-[giggling]

21:28.496 --> 21:30.956
-There he is!
-We gotta go, Coran!

21:31.040 --> 21:32.500
[panting]

21:32.583 --> 21:34.168
I got the scaultrite lenses!

21:34.335 --> 21:36.712
Scaultrite?
Hold on a tick!

21:37.338 --> 21:38.756
No take-backs!

21:39.507 --> 21:40.758
Get back here!

21:40.841 --> 21:42.760
[screaming]

21:49.433 --> 21:51.769
Doggone it!
You better run!

21:52.520 --> 21:56.273
Don't let me catch you
in my jurisdiction again, pirates!

21:56.440 --> 21:59.026
Oh, so you can't follow us outside, huh?

21:59.109 --> 22:00.945
[taunting, yelping]

22:01.445 --> 22:02.571
[grunting]

22:02.655 --> 22:05.324
That's one for Varkon.

22:06.283 --> 22:07.743
We got our lenses!

22:07.910 --> 22:10.579
Excellent! Now, we can
get the teludav up and running.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.457
Where's Shiro?

22:15.000 --> 22:16.627
What did you do?
Take a nap?

22:16.710 --> 22:18.754
Not exactly.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.422
Is that a cow?

22:20.506 --> 22:22.716
Mm-hmm, his name is Kaltenecker.

22:22.800 --> 22:25.135
[mooing]

22:25.970 --> 22:28.931
So, did you find a way
to bond with your lion?

22:29.098 --> 22:30.683
Yes, and we need to get moving.

22:30.766 --> 22:33.602
We're headed for the
Blade of Marmora's headquarters.

22:35.563 --> 22:36.814
I'll plot a course.

22:36.981 --> 22:39.775
While you're doing that, I'm gonna
hook up the video game Lance and I bought.

22:40.693 --> 22:42.611
Yeah! Let's get this baby set up.

22:43.070 --> 22:44.446
Where can we...

22:44.530 --> 22:45.614
How do...

22:47.533 --> 22:49.994
[Pidge]
<i>No!</i>
