00:19.603 --> 00:21.503
Freezing my balls off.

00:22.303 --> 00:26.404
It ain't so bad. Loosen up.
Couple more months, it's gonna be spring.

00:27.504 --> 00:28.805
Spring, huh?

00:29.704 --> 00:33.804
Listen, you gotta realize the bosses
did you a favor sending you down here.

00:33.905 --> 00:37.405
-Citywide to Marine Unit.
-7672. Go ahead.

00:38.405 --> 00:42.805
Distress call from a private craft.
60-foot white vessel. Engines are dead.

00:43.406 --> 00:45.306
What's the location, Citywide?

00:45.706 --> 00:50.107
In the channel near the bridge.
About 2,000 yards off the Armistead pier.

00:51.306 --> 00:53.207
10-4, we're responding.

01:14.809 --> 01:16.609
My father used to work there.

01:16.709 --> 01:18.810
-Beth Steel?
-In the shipyards there, yeah.

01:18.910 --> 01:23.310
I had an uncle who was a supervisor there.
Got laid off in '78, though.

01:23.710 --> 01:25.311
'73 for my dad.

01:28.610 --> 01:30.811
-Party boat?
-Pretty one, yeah.

01:30.911 --> 01:34.011
-More than one engine, right?
-Probably an electrical problem.

01:53.713 --> 01:55.513
Is that a police boat?

01:58.813 --> 02:00.714
How are you tonight? Good to see you.

02:00.814 --> 02:02.314
Henry, how are you?

02:06.915 --> 02:08.615
-Drink?
-No, thanks.

02:10.715 --> 02:12.316
-You're the Captain?
-Yeah.

02:12.415 --> 02:14.316
-Harbormaster?
-No, City Police.

02:15.216 --> 02:18.617
-So you're dead in the water?
-Think it's the starter.

02:19.316 --> 02:21.717
-You're not a mechanic, are you?
-Me? No.

02:21.817 --> 02:23.917
I can't tell the aft from the stern.

02:24.117 --> 02:26.517
Best I can offer you is a tow line.

02:28.017 --> 02:30.317
Claude, looks like they're gonna need a pull.

02:30.418 --> 02:33.218
-10-4, we'll tow to Henderson's.
-That'll work.

02:35.518 --> 02:38.018
Any chance you can hold off
on bringing us in?

02:38.118 --> 02:39.419
Lot of partying going on now.

02:39.518 --> 02:42.219
I wouldn't wanna cut it short
for a little engine trouble.

02:42.319 --> 02:44.619
You're in the shipping channel.

02:54.820 --> 02:59.321
You tow us somewhere out of the way,
and the band plays on a while longer.

05:01.135 --> 05:03.536
...because you see what I'm saying, right?

05:03.635 --> 05:07.034
I mean, three years in auto theft
and I didn't learn anything.

05:07.134 --> 05:08.235
I didn't care.

05:08.435 --> 05:11.235
I'm telling you,
I didn't even wanna be a police anymore.

05:11.335 --> 05:12.635
I honestly didn't.

05:12.936 --> 05:15.936
I think that was why
I shot up my car like I did.

05:16.636 --> 05:20.237
But this thing we did on Barksdale,
the wiretap and all...

05:20.537 --> 05:24.237
that felt like something.
That felt like something I wanna do.

05:24.337 --> 05:28.138
So I was thinking, you know,
narcotics, maybe.

05:28.738 --> 05:30.639
Major, you want this stuff where?

05:30.738 --> 05:33.638
Just in here.
Up against the wall over there.

05:34.237 --> 05:37.339
If there aren't any openings
in the regular narcotics shift...

05:37.439 --> 05:39.938
maybe assets forfeiture
or something like that.

05:40.039 --> 05:42.339
Easy. Everything breaks.

05:43.239 --> 05:45.740
I mean, with this Barksdale thing...

05:45.840 --> 05:49.740
Lester Freamon had us deep into the money.
Real deep.

05:49.840 --> 05:53.841
We could've seized real estate, cash,
vehicles, all kinds of stuff.

05:53.941 --> 05:57.842
If the bosses, I mean,
if command had let that case go forward.

05:57.941 --> 05:59.341
We were on it.

05:59.940 --> 06:03.841
-Look at that. It's the dove.
-Right.

06:07.442 --> 06:09.842
-So what do you think?
-What do I think?

06:10.842 --> 06:15.343
I think you're gonna take
the Sergeant's Exam next month.

06:16.643 --> 06:19.544
And because I have Andy Krawczyk's ear...

06:19.644 --> 06:23.244
and because he has City Hall's ear...

06:23.644 --> 06:25.644
you're gonna make Sergeant.

06:27.243 --> 06:29.744
Then you're gonna come out here
to the Southeast...

06:29.844 --> 06:33.145
where, because I'm your father-in-law...

06:33.844 --> 06:37.845
you're gonna be assigned a daytime shift
in a quiet sector.

06:39.045 --> 06:42.546
Then you're gonna take the Lieutenant's
Exam where you'll also score high.

06:42.646 --> 06:44.646
I don't want to make rank.

06:45.147 --> 06:47.546
I want to work cases. Good cases.

06:48.647 --> 06:49.747
Roland.

06:53.647 --> 06:55.047
Listen to me.

06:55.646 --> 06:59.847
You did good with the drug thing.
You buckled down, you did the work.

06:59.948 --> 07:02.547
And except for that thing
with the Grand Jury...

07:02.648 --> 07:05.549
you helped take
some of the stink off yourself.

07:05.649 --> 07:08.749
Now if you'll just shut up and listen to me...

07:09.649 --> 07:12.849
you might actually have a career
in this department.

07:20.750 --> 07:23.950
-This radio ain't working that well.
-We're losing it.

07:24.450 --> 07:27.251
-We're losing the station, man.
-What you mean?

07:27.351 --> 07:30.251
We done gone so far from Baltimore,
we're losing the station.

07:30.351 --> 07:34.551
-Try a Philly station or some shit like that.
-The radio in Philly is different?

07:34.651 --> 07:36.752
Nigger, you gotta be fucking with me, right?

07:36.852 --> 07:38.952
You never heard a station
outside of Baltimore?

07:39.052 --> 07:42.953
I ain't never left Baltimore
except that Boys' Village shit one day.

07:43.052 --> 07:46.054
And I wasn't trying to hear no radio
up in that bitch.

07:49.653 --> 07:52.754
Come on, man. You're killing me. Stop.

07:55.353 --> 07:57.554
It's been perfect tomato weather out there.

07:57.654 --> 08:01.654
These wonderful hot, humid days,
and then rain at night.

08:01.754 --> 08:04.655
-This a Philly station?
-How the fuck would I know?

08:06.755 --> 08:10.255
Why would anybody wanna leave Baltimore?
That's what I'm asking.

08:10.556 --> 08:13.257
Yo, that be the exit. Take that shit.

08:34.759 --> 08:36.159
So far they on it.

09:43.565 --> 09:44.966
Ahoy, matey.

09:45.366 --> 09:48.267
The girls always tell me
about the little man in the boat.

09:48.367 --> 09:51.167
-Now I know who they talking about.
-Come on board, man.

09:51.267 --> 09:53.468
-Come on, I wanna show you.
-Fuck, no.

09:53.567 --> 09:55.667
-What's the matter?
-The Bunk can't swim.

09:55.767 --> 09:58.068
I ain't too good at floating, either.

09:58.368 --> 10:00.668
So what brings you to the water's edge?

10:01.168 --> 10:04.568
Ilene Nathan called.
Gant case is coming up in four weeks.

10:04.768 --> 10:07.768
She wants to start doing preliminaries
on our witnesses.

10:07.868 --> 10:11.369
That means the old lady from the projects,
which is no problem.

10:11.469 --> 10:13.969
And your man Omar, who's in the wind.

10:17.569 --> 10:19.670
You got a line on Omar, Jimmy?

10:20.270 --> 10:23.971
-Well, he's not to starboard.
-That's port, fool.

10:24.971 --> 10:27.272
-How the fuck would you know?
-Come on.

10:27.871 --> 10:30.572
Let me buy you lunch
and we can think on this shit together.

10:30.672 --> 10:32.471
I leave, I gotta tell my Sergeant.

10:32.571 --> 10:36.571
That reminds me. Landsman wants his $10.

10:36.772 --> 10:40.072
-What for?
-For betting that you'd ride the boat.

10:40.873 --> 10:43.573
You tell that motherfucker
he's not gonna see that money...

10:43.673 --> 10:47.474
especially since it was probably him
told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.

10:47.574 --> 10:50.174
-Ain't the same up there without your ass.
-No?

10:50.274 --> 10:51.674
Better, actually.

10:51.774 --> 10:53.174
Hey, come on, now.

10:56.874 --> 10:58.173
The canal gets dredged...

10:58.273 --> 11:01.175
it means we all work.
Your people, my people.

11:01.275 --> 11:03.074
The canal's the key, Nat. You know this.

11:03.174 --> 11:05.675
Yeah, but you know how much money
you're gonna spend...

11:05.775 --> 11:07.475
to even get them talking about that shit?

11:07.575 --> 11:10.776
We don't take a shot,
we might as well roll over and die right now.

11:10.876 --> 11:12.976
No, you get them to rebuild the grain pier.

11:13.176 --> 11:15.876
-You got a 100 ships right there.
-That's break-bulk, Nat.

11:15.977 --> 11:19.077
Best you'll do is one or two
extra gangs a week on them blowers.

11:19.177 --> 11:20.977
That's six or seven-man gangs at best.

11:21.077 --> 11:24.878
But you try for that, you might actually
come away with something.

11:24.978 --> 11:27.777
You go down to Annapolis
asking for the goddamn canal...

11:27.877 --> 11:31.778
you gonna come back with nothing but
your little shriveled-ass dick in your hand.

11:31.877 --> 11:35.678
What's more,
if the grain pier don't get fixed up soon...

11:35.778 --> 11:39.379
some asshole's gonna fuck us
by building condominiums all over it.

11:39.479 --> 11:42.979
-Nat, if the canal were 2 feet deeper--
-Fuck the canal.

11:43.180 --> 11:45.180
I'm going to the District Council.

11:45.380 --> 11:48.080
I'm gonna tell them
to push for the grain pier.

11:48.180 --> 11:50.580
-You feel me?
-Nat, calm the fuck down.

11:50.680 --> 11:55.281
Goddamn Checkers Local always acting
like you're the king of everything and shit.

11:56.080 --> 11:57.680
Nat, listen to me. If we--

11:57.780 --> 12:00.081
Y'all need to crawl back down
in them holds...

12:00.181 --> 12:03.382
and remind yourself of who you is
and where you come from.

12:06.482 --> 12:07.782
Damn, Frank.

12:09.682 --> 12:14.283
We just sat here and watched Nat Coxson
take a shit all over you.

12:14.383 --> 12:17.883
And shrivel-dick motherfucker
that you are, you take it.

12:17.983 --> 12:18.984
For your information...

12:19.084 --> 12:22.384
I wake up every morning
with an angry, blue-veined diamond-cutter.

12:22.484 --> 12:25.984
I was gonna enlighten the president
of Local 47 on this particular point...

12:26.084 --> 12:27.984
and he chose to depart.

12:32.685 --> 12:36.285
-Blue steel, gentlemen.
-For Christ's sake.

12:37.386 --> 12:40.286
Three-and-a-half inches of hard blue steel.

13:26.991 --> 13:31.592
-Nicky boy, you working today?
-As a lasher for Big Roy's crew.

13:32.591 --> 13:35.192
Attaboy. Make the family proud.

13:36.192 --> 13:38.493
First day they give me in two weeks.

13:39.492 --> 13:41.992
-Is Ott around?
-On his ass as usual.

13:42.092 --> 13:45.293
Worthless fuck still owes me $20
for them lotto tickets.

13:49.193 --> 13:50.494
Hey, Nick.

13:54.994 --> 13:58.394
You need to see the Greek
and get a number. He's got one on the way.

13:58.495 --> 14:00.095
-Today?
-Tomorrow.

14:00.195 --> 14:02.596
The Atlantic Light over at North Point.

14:04.595 --> 14:05.896
All right.

14:06.696 --> 14:09.095
-Yo, Frank.
-What's up?

14:09.496 --> 14:12.896
You gotta get with Ziggy, man.
He's all over the place.

14:23.797 --> 14:27.098
I'm here since 8:00.
You know I been here since 8:00.

14:27.398 --> 14:29.898
-Hold your horses.
-You fucking goose.

14:30.398 --> 14:33.298
I'm gonna find it for you.
Just shut the fuck up a minute.

14:33.398 --> 14:34.799
How we doing?

14:34.899 --> 14:37.098
-Ain't a problem, Chief.
-The fuck it ain't.

14:37.198 --> 14:39.499
I'm down here since 8:00
for crane-to-chassis...

14:39.599 --> 14:42.699
-and Tweety Bird here lost the can.
-It ain't lost.

14:43.999 --> 14:47.500
It's right here on the manifest as a hot box.
Where is it, Zig?

14:48.000 --> 14:52.000
-It's either in Bay 7, or--
-Bay 7 is empty, man.

14:52.300 --> 14:54.701
Or it ain't. In that case...

14:55.801 --> 14:59.502
it's definitely somewhere in the stacks.

14:59.602 --> 15:00.701
Jesus fucking Christ.

15:00.802 --> 15:03.401
You're killing me here, Ziggy.
You are fucking killing me.

15:03.602 --> 15:07.002
Get me a number for your shipping agent.
I'll call and try to square it.

15:07.102 --> 15:08.302
And you.

15:08.602 --> 15:12.003
You clock out today and leave your box,
and don't ever come the fuck back.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.102
You hear me, Zig? You're fired.

15:14.202 --> 15:16.103
Later for you, goofus.

15:18.704 --> 15:22.204
Fucking guy.
He loses his job and he couldn't care less.

15:22.404 --> 15:24.304
-He ain't fired, man.
-No?

15:24.404 --> 15:26.004
That's his father.

15:42.206 --> 15:43.706
How fast you need this?

15:43.806 --> 15:47.507
Case goes to trial in a month.
Got to start prepping it this week.

15:54.408 --> 15:55.908
Officer Burns.

15:58.707 --> 16:00.007
Detective.

16:01.308 --> 16:04.609
I heard they posted you down here.

16:05.708 --> 16:07.809
But, I mean, you know, damn.

16:09.809 --> 16:12.509
These motherfuckers don't play, do they?

16:12.910 --> 16:15.009
So what brings you downstairs?

16:15.109 --> 16:18.410
I was pulling evidence on the Gant case.

16:18.610 --> 16:22.511
You know, trial date for Bird is next month
and llene Nathan wanted to be ready.

16:22.611 --> 16:24.310
You give him my love.

16:24.510 --> 16:26.211
-Who?
-Bird.

16:30.911 --> 16:33.911
-No evidence.
-What do you mean, no evidence?

16:34.011 --> 16:38.212
Submission slip says
"Row BB, Section 14, Shelf 3...

16:38.313 --> 16:40.113
"Four, Right rear." It says that.

16:40.213 --> 16:41.913
-So?
-No such thing.

16:42.013 --> 16:45.613
BB has 1 2 sections. This says 14.
You see what I'm saying?

16:46.614 --> 16:48.014
No evidence.

16:54.714 --> 16:58.414
Winters kill off
the weaker varieties of caterpillars.

16:59.414 --> 17:03.415
-Fuck me.
-...that's of an entirely different breed....

17:03.515 --> 17:04.515
Fuck.

17:14.715 --> 17:17.718
...protection against caterpillars,
they eat right through it.

17:17.817 --> 17:20.717
But it is a sort of a warning system.

17:27.518 --> 17:28.718
They here.

18:06.022 --> 18:07.923
Franoosh, you made it.

18:08.423 --> 18:10.523
Right, Father. Got you covered here.

18:11.623 --> 18:12.822
Come on.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.223
You wanna see your window?

18:25.724 --> 18:30.225
Only Franoosh Sobotka would send
all the way to Esslingen for stained glass.

18:31.625 --> 18:35.825
The Germans are hard-headed,
but you can't beat them for craft.

18:38.026 --> 18:41.425
I was glad to do it, Father,
for the church, you know.

18:42.725 --> 18:45.226
Truth is I need to ask you
something in return.

18:45.326 --> 18:46.926
Anything I can do.

18:47.127 --> 18:50.327
-I need some face time with the Senator.
-Barbara?

18:51.527 --> 18:54.527
She comes to the early mass on Sunday,
the one in Polish.

18:54.627 --> 18:56.127
We got nothing but problems, Father.

18:56.327 --> 18:58.528
We need to see something happen
with the C&D Canal...

18:58.728 --> 19:00.629
and the grain pier's been down for a year.

19:00.729 --> 19:04.529
I got tough guys coming in
to confess things I never heard before.

19:04.729 --> 19:08.428
I don't need you to tell me
how bad things are at the docks.

19:08.528 --> 19:11.328
So you'll set something up
with Mikulski soon?

19:11.529 --> 19:15.229
You didn't need a German window
to ask me for that, Francis.

19:15.930 --> 19:17.130
And what's more...

19:17.230 --> 19:19.631
you've made offerings
way above what it would take...

19:19.731 --> 19:21.830
to get that window up there.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.732
How long since your last confession?

19:32.732 --> 19:34.432
I'll see you, Father.

19:36.132 --> 19:38.532
This shit might be somewhere else, man.

19:38.732 --> 19:41.633
Yo, the shit is always up in the door, man.

19:42.533 --> 19:44.833
Motherfucker, you been
standing there watching us.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.133
You see any shit come up out of there?

19:49.033 --> 19:51.134
You seen we ain't take shit up off this car.

19:51.234 --> 19:52.334
-All right.
-You seen it.

19:52.434 --> 19:55.235
Who gonna believe us? This shit is missing.

19:55.434 --> 19:56.835
And fuck what you're saying.

19:56.935 --> 19:59.435
All he's gonna hear
is that this shit is fucking missing.

19:59.535 --> 20:00.635
Yo, check it again.

20:00.735 --> 20:03.535
Yo, the shit ain't there, man.
Call your man and say so.

20:03.735 --> 20:05.235
Nigger, what you say?

20:05.335 --> 20:08.836
-I said check it again, God damn it!
-Whoa, chill.

20:08.936 --> 20:11.436
Yo, man, cut that shit the fuck out.

20:13.837 --> 20:16.437
What the fuck is going on today, man?

20:19.837 --> 20:22.038
Taking their time, ain't they?

20:36.739 --> 20:38.539
What the hell is going on?

20:41.140 --> 20:42.540
Come on, man.

20:42.640 --> 20:43.740
Damn!

20:47.240 --> 20:50.641
-Ain't anywhere in this section either.
-Start on the next row.

20:51.841 --> 20:55.241
Lieutenant, those two bags could be
anywhere in this damn basement.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.740
You're right.

20:58.741 --> 21:01.541
-We could be here all night.
-Right again.

21:03.541 --> 21:05.642
So that's overtime, right?

21:13.243 --> 21:15.343
Fuck me. I still cannot type.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.544
Fucking white boys, I love them.
I fucking love them.

21:19.644 --> 21:22.344
-Yeah?
-Dumb as a box of rocks.

21:23.044 --> 21:24.744
-Who?
-White boys.

21:24.944 --> 21:27.544
Talking about the brain-deads
in my Kane Street case.

21:27.644 --> 21:30.045
I call him up,
I tell him I wanna buy some drugs.

21:30.145 --> 21:31.445
You know what he says?

21:31.545 --> 21:34.245
"Okay, I'll sell you the drugs.
How much drugs do you want?"

21:34.345 --> 21:38.146
I swear to God, Kima, they don't code it,
they don't ask for a meet, nothing.

21:38.246 --> 21:41.346
And then when you make the deal,
there's no runner, no bullshit.

21:41.446 --> 21:43.647
It's the guy himself
walking up to you, saying:

21:43.747 --> 21:46.047
"I brought the drugs.
Did you bring the money?"

21:46.147 --> 21:48.848
I'm not kidding.
I have much respect for black people...

21:48.948 --> 21:50.946
after working with these idiots
for two weeks.

21:51.046 --> 21:55.147
If white boys wanna sell drugs in Baltimore,
they have to make different laws for it...

21:55.247 --> 21:56.748
Iike even it out for them.

21:56.848 --> 21:59.948
-Affirmative action.
-Leave no white man behind.

22:00.749 --> 22:04.149
-What the fuck do you want?
-I need you to do the seizures.

22:04.249 --> 22:07.550
You got titles, deeds, registrations?
What do you have for me?

22:07.649 --> 22:10.250
Thought you did that.
You're the Forfeiture Unit, right?

22:10.350 --> 22:13.350
I write all the affidavits
and the filing for the City Solicitor.

22:13.450 --> 22:16.250
But you've gotta give me the information
on what we're taking.

22:16.450 --> 22:18.350
That's a fucking hassle.

22:18.450 --> 22:21.151
You want the property, do the paperwork.

22:21.250 --> 22:25.151
You gotta step up, Herc.
You don't have me or Carver to lean on here.

22:25.251 --> 22:26.251
No?

22:27.151 --> 22:29.352
How about you come
on the raids tomorrow?

22:29.452 --> 22:31.451
Take a few doors with me
for old time's sake.

22:31.551 --> 22:32.552
You taking doors?

22:32.652 --> 22:35.252
Yeah, two houses and a bar on Kane Street.

22:35.352 --> 22:38.653
Come on, Kima, mount up with us.
I know you miss it.

22:41.953 --> 22:46.253
I'm done rolling around the gutter.
I am inside now.

22:46.953 --> 22:49.954
-You're a housecat now?
-I made a promise.

22:50.653 --> 22:53.254
I gotta say, Kima. If you were a guy...

22:53.354 --> 22:56.455
and, actually, in some ways
you're better than most guys I know.

22:56.555 --> 22:59.855
If you were a guy, your friends
would buy you a beer and let you know.

22:59.955 --> 23:02.955
-Let me know what?
-You're fucking whipped.

23:03.256 --> 23:06.056
-Whipped?
-Pussy-whipped within an inch of your life.

23:06.156 --> 23:07.656
I kid you not.

23:14.456 --> 23:15.656
So....

23:19.056 --> 23:20.057
So?

23:24.657 --> 23:26.658
So where do we find Omar?

23:28.558 --> 23:29.558
Who?

23:37.260 --> 23:39.558
-He say anything else?
-No.

23:40.059 --> 23:42.560
Just to come back. All of us.

23:44.659 --> 23:46.159
How he say it?

23:46.660 --> 23:49.460
You know, he just said it.

23:53.561 --> 23:56.161
-Fuck.
-Yeah.

24:16.164 --> 24:17.263
Shit.

24:37.465 --> 24:39.566
-They holding to it?
-So far.

24:41.966 --> 24:43.267
All right.

24:54.468 --> 24:56.168
They got the times right?

24:57.069 --> 24:58.569
How about the mileage?

25:02.468 --> 25:03.569
All right.

25:08.969 --> 25:11.369
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

25:11.770 --> 25:14.070
-You never saw him out the car?
-No.

25:15.070 --> 25:18.070
-You stayed with him the whole time?
-Every minute.

25:20.171 --> 25:22.971
How long before he came out
the parking garage?

25:23.071 --> 25:26.772
-How long was he on his own?
-Not enough time to do shit, String.

25:26.872 --> 25:28.871
He was in and out, like, in three minutes.

25:28.971 --> 25:30.171
Chill.

25:35.772 --> 25:37.372
-This shit is fucked up.
-Look--

25:37.573 --> 25:38.772
You follow the directions?

25:38.873 --> 25:41.272
-I did just like you told me.
-Wrote down the mileage?

25:41.372 --> 25:42.973
-Yeah.
-Let me see.

25:46.873 --> 25:48.574
See, right there.

25:55.574 --> 25:58.574
No, you're three-tenths of a mile long, dawg.

25:59.775 --> 26:02.475
And if you followed directions,
you wouldn't be.

26:02.675 --> 26:06.076
String, I did everything like I should, man.
I swear.

26:29.978 --> 26:31.578
You got answers?

26:33.279 --> 26:35.179
You didn't have to take a detour
in Camden...

26:35.279 --> 26:38.379
when they shut down a couple of blocks
on the Boulevard?

26:40.280 --> 26:42.080
You hurt your foot?

26:42.379 --> 26:45.780
-My foot?
-You know, the way you kicked that tire jack.

26:51.380 --> 26:53.981
-You was on us the whole time?
-Who, me?

26:54.081 --> 26:56.281
Y'all had people following us.

26:59.881 --> 27:01.482
So where it at?

27:05.783 --> 27:08.383
You know, you should take me with you.

27:09.583 --> 27:11.983
I should meet these guys.
If I meet these guys...

27:12.083 --> 27:15.984
we can figure out ways to do business.
You know what I'm saying?

27:16.282 --> 27:19.484
-Zig, these guys are real.
-What, I ain't real?

27:28.184 --> 27:29.585
Six degrees.

27:29.685 --> 27:32.085
Everybody's going home
to sauerkraut and Santy Claus...

27:32.185 --> 27:34.486
and here comes a gang of us
walking the other way...

27:34.586 --> 27:37.986
Little Big Roy with his wooden leg.

27:38.087 --> 27:40.486
-Christ, them wooden shovels.
-Yeah.

27:40.686 --> 27:43.686
You children don't know nothing
about them wooden shovels, do you?

27:43.786 --> 27:45.986
Can't have no sparks
when you working grain.

27:46.086 --> 27:48.486
-Kaboom.
-It's more like kaput.

27:48.586 --> 27:52.287
You never gonna see another grain ship
here in Bawlmer, my friends.

27:52.487 --> 27:54.588
Zig, you believe these fucking dinosaurs?

27:54.788 --> 27:58.988
They sit around all day talking shit about
how they used to off-load with shovels...

27:59.088 --> 28:02.389
and carry fucking railroad cars
on their backs.

28:02.489 --> 28:04.789
Shit, and drink whiskey through a fire hose.

28:04.889 --> 28:08.490
Go home and fuck their wives till breakfast.
There was some heroes back then.

28:08.590 --> 28:10.689
Shit is thick in here tonight, gentlemen.

28:10.789 --> 28:13.390
What can you do?
This generation, they just don't know.

28:13.490 --> 28:16.090
-Ain't never gonna be what it was.
-No, indeed.

28:16.190 --> 28:19.890
Every night with these old fucks.
It's like 1952 and shit.

28:20.491 --> 28:25.291
Boys, you know, when I was your age,
I unloaded ten ships a goddamn day.

28:26.892 --> 28:28.692
You know, I'd do it with one arm...

28:28.792 --> 28:31.992
after a 300-pound bag of Polish dildos
fell on me.

28:32.092 --> 28:32.892
Whoa, wait. What the fuck is a Polish dildo?

28:32.892 --> 28:35.293
Whoa, wait. What the fuck is a Polish dildo?

28:35.393 --> 28:37.692
Actually, at my house, it's a ring of kielbasa.

28:37.792 --> 28:39.992
Christ, here we go again.

28:40.693 --> 28:42.593
Bring out pretty boy.

28:42.692 --> 28:46.993
But, you know, where you boys hail from,
I'm sure any old breakfast link will do.

28:47.594 --> 28:49.493
You know he's gonna
pull out his dick, right?

28:49.593 --> 28:51.194
That boy ain't right.

28:51.294 --> 28:52.595
It was just me...

28:52.695 --> 28:55.695
and my old wooden leg,
and my old wooden shovel...

28:55.795 --> 28:58.695
and my glass eye, and my Polish pencil.

28:58.795 --> 29:02.996
Like anyone from the Checkers Local
ever used anything but a real pencil.

29:03.095 --> 29:05.795
Shit, they don't even push
one of them no more.

29:08.796 --> 29:10.896
Talking trash about 1514.

29:10.996 --> 29:14.797
Jesus H. Christ, you know what?
All hands starboard.

29:16.497 --> 29:18.797
Come on.

29:19.798 --> 29:22.798
The old tub is listing. Can you feel her?

29:22.898 --> 29:24.298
You wanna know why?

29:24.398 --> 29:27.598
'Cause them old fucks
done unloaded so much bullshit...

29:27.698 --> 29:30.198
that this whole motherfucker's
gonna capsize.

29:30.298 --> 29:32.298
Brace yourselves, we're sinking.

29:32.898 --> 29:34.499
God damn it, Ziggy.

29:34.599 --> 29:36.998
You're not taking your dick out
in here again.

29:37.098 --> 29:41.400
Let me show you old gents some bulk cargo
that none of you could ever handle.

29:43.899 --> 29:46.500
Who says they don't make them
like they used to?

29:46.600 --> 29:48.900
Pretty boy is on the town tonight.

29:53.602 --> 29:55.302
Fucking Ziggy, man.

31:31.412 --> 31:34.012
-Bring her in the boat?
-Hell, no.

31:34.312 --> 31:38.113
-She'll fall apart if we try to bring her in.
-What's the plan then?

31:38.213 --> 31:41.713
We'll hook her real good.
We'll tow her slowly over to the pier.

31:42.613 --> 31:45.214
-What's she look like?
-What do you mean?

31:45.414 --> 31:48.413
-How long you think she's been in?
-She's fresh.

31:49.213 --> 31:52.914
-Legs are broke, though.
-Probably a jumper from the bridge.

32:27.118 --> 32:28.818
All right, Ma. Shit.

32:42.519 --> 32:44.119
Kitchen's closed.

32:45.319 --> 32:49.020
There's no service for drunks
who can't get up in time to catch a ship.

32:49.120 --> 32:50.220
What ship?

32:50.820 --> 32:52.921
Your father says the Talco Line is in today.

32:53.121 --> 32:55.621
That makes two ships at North Point.

32:58.122 --> 33:01.322
It's the Atlantic Light.
Ain't due until this afternoon.

33:01.422 --> 33:03.423
That still is no excuse.

33:15.624 --> 33:17.324
Good morning, Mom.

33:19.824 --> 33:22.125
Couple of goddamn drunks I got.

33:24.624 --> 33:27.325
And don't leave
without taking your cousin with you.

33:27.425 --> 33:31.425
I gotta clean in there,
and I ain't gonna do it around his carcass.

34:10.329 --> 34:12.730
You keep us guessing, don't you, Stan?

34:12.830 --> 34:15.030
At Sunday mass, you can't be found.

34:15.130 --> 34:17.831
But early on a Tuesday,
you arrive with an army.

34:18.929 --> 34:22.731
$2,500 from myself and every other Polack...

34:22.831 --> 34:25.531
in three districts and four firehouses.

34:25.732 --> 34:28.931
-And to what do we owe such generosity?
-A surprise.

34:29.032 --> 34:32.031
We ordered up a window
for where you renovated the nave.

34:32.130 --> 34:34.232
A memorial. Let me see that.

34:36.833 --> 34:39.232
To Polish police and firefighters.

34:41.033 --> 34:45.134
Found this craftsman down in Glen Burnie
that you would not believe.

34:45.933 --> 34:48.333
-For the nave?
-Yeah, for the nave.

34:53.835 --> 34:58.034
We could use another window
on the second floor of the rectory.

34:59.234 --> 35:01.735
-The rectory?
-The upstairs hallway.

35:02.935 --> 35:05.436
How much did them dock boys offer
for this spot?

35:05.636 --> 35:08.536
-I can match it.
-Offerings are confidential, Stan.

35:08.636 --> 35:12.337
-And as you can see--
-I can go as high as $4,000.

35:13.036 --> 35:15.637
Just tell me if they went higher than $4,000.

35:17.037 --> 35:19.737
More than $4,000? From the docks?

35:20.938 --> 35:22.538
How the hell....

35:23.738 --> 35:25.438
I'm sorry, Father.

35:26.537 --> 35:29.738
-Who came to you with the offer?
-Francis Sobotka.

35:30.839 --> 35:32.439
Frank Sobotka has that kind of money?

35:32.639 --> 35:35.139
-It was from his local.
-The Checkers?

35:35.239 --> 35:39.740
-They don't have 100 guys left paying dues.
-It's a parish of givers, Stan.

35:40.940 --> 35:42.840
Maybe you talk to Frank.

35:43.740 --> 35:45.440
Work it out somehow.

35:47.241 --> 35:49.241
Yeah, we'll talk.

35:56.542 --> 35:57.842
Major?

36:16.744 --> 36:20.444
Well, if it isn't Barnacle Bill, the sailor.

36:20.543 --> 36:21.744
Ray, how you been?

36:21.844 --> 36:24.044
I got nothing but red ink
under my name this year.

36:24.144 --> 36:26.845
Landsman's become an asshole with teeth.

36:27.645 --> 36:30.446
-Fish your wish, huh?
-Jumper, probably.

36:32.146 --> 36:35.546
-This close to the bridge.
-Probably, yeah.

36:35.846 --> 36:37.646
-Pretty, though.
-She is, yeah.

36:37.746 --> 36:39.346
I go into the men's room this morning.

36:39.446 --> 36:41.947
Guess who's in the next stall
puking his guts out.

36:42.047 --> 36:43.447
Bunk Moreland.

36:43.547 --> 36:46.947
-How'd you know?
-Useless fuck can't hold his liquor.

37:03.349 --> 37:05.449
-What's happening, man?
-What's up, Fam?

37:05.549 --> 37:06.549
All right.

37:06.950 --> 37:10.550
-You ain't heard from Roberto yet?
-Not a goddamn word, man.

37:10.650 --> 37:15.550
Billy still got our money though, right?
So you need to get down to New York, man.

37:16.250 --> 37:19.251
Fuck kind of game this nigger playing?
You sure of our people?

37:19.351 --> 37:21.851
I broke down all their stories
and they came back clean.

37:21.951 --> 37:24.951
Besides, I had some good people
watching them.

37:26.751 --> 37:28.852
-Who?
-Tank, Country.

37:28.952 --> 37:31.052
-How long that motherfucker been home?
-A month.

37:31.152 --> 37:34.953
Still on parole. He said, "fuck that."
Straight back in the mix.

37:35.052 --> 37:36.153
All right.

37:36.253 --> 37:40.453
So good, it ain't on us. It's on Roberto.
Set it straight. You know what I mean?

37:40.553 --> 37:43.453
So when you go hard on them,
take it light, but be firm.

37:43.553 --> 37:46.254
They got our money
and we ain't got the product.

37:46.354 --> 37:48.954
So, you feel me? The shit ain't right.

37:49.754 --> 37:52.154
How you fixed in here otherwise, B?

37:53.255 --> 37:55.955
This ain't no thing, man.
You know what I mean?

37:56.355 --> 37:59.055
You come in here, man,
you get your mind right.

37:59.355 --> 38:03.256
You get in here and you do two days.
It's the day you come in this motherfucker--

38:03.356 --> 38:06.757
-And the day you get out this motherfucker.
-That's right.

38:07.957 --> 38:09.256
Exactly.

38:11.056 --> 38:12.456
-What's up?
-How you doing?

38:12.556 --> 38:15.756
-Coming from the hiring hall?
-I'm working the Atlantic late today.

38:15.856 --> 38:18.557
-How's it looking for Local 47?
-You're shit out of luck.

38:18.657 --> 38:20.857
ROIROs isn't going to anybody
lower than a G-series.

38:20.957 --> 38:23.358
Best you can get,
maybe half a day doing break-bulk...

38:23.458 --> 38:25.258
on an aluminum load at Locust Point.

38:25.358 --> 38:27.958
-Half a day, huh?
-Seniority sucks.

38:29.159 --> 38:32.660
-Yeah, if you ain't senior, it does.
-Yeah, you got that right.

38:32.959 --> 38:34.859
-I'm out of here.
-Yeah, I'll see you.

38:34.959 --> 38:38.159
-The fuck you ain't wake me up for?
-Just getting up now, fuck-face?

38:38.259 --> 38:40.560
No, actually,
your ma makes a good breakfast.

38:40.660 --> 38:43.160
-No fucking way.
-Bacon and eggs, baby.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.660
You going down to see the Greek, right?

38:47.561 --> 38:50.361
Come on, man.
I ain't gonna fuck it up for you.

38:50.461 --> 38:53.061
For Christ's sake,
will you just get in the car already?

38:53.161 --> 38:55.762
Come on. Let's go.

39:00.863 --> 39:04.462
I swear to God, Ziggy.
You open your mouth, I'll fucking kill you.

39:26.666 --> 39:28.965
-Nicky, from the docks.
-Spiros.

39:29.065 --> 39:31.065
How are you? Good?

39:32.565 --> 39:35.266
-Who's your friend?
-This is Zig, my uncle's kid.

39:35.366 --> 39:37.566
-Your uncle? Frankie?
-Yeah.

39:37.666 --> 39:41.266
Ziggy's his oldest.
My car broke down, you know. He drove.

39:42.967 --> 39:45.067
So you must be the Greek.

39:48.668 --> 39:50.568
Well, I'm Greek anyway.

39:51.668 --> 39:55.369
Boris Badanoff.
I know you from around the way, right?

39:55.868 --> 40:00.168
Why am I Boris? I don't understand this.
Everywhere I am Boris.

40:00.268 --> 40:03.469
-Shit, you're Russian, right?
-No, Ukraine. Kyiv is Ukraine.

40:03.569 --> 40:06.769
-It's the same difference, though.
-No, you're wrong.

40:07.669 --> 40:10.870
What's the matter?
You don't like being called Boris?

40:10.970 --> 40:11.970
Sergei.

40:12.070 --> 40:16.470
No way, man. Boris is way better.
It's like the guy from the cartoon.

40:17.371 --> 40:18.971
Boris and Natasha?

40:19.472 --> 40:22.072
Bullwinkle, man. Rocky and Bullwinkle.

40:22.272 --> 40:25.471
-You want some coffee, pie?
-No, I'm good.

40:25.571 --> 40:28.271
-Actually, what kind of pie you got?
-Hey, Zig.

40:28.571 --> 40:30.472
Shut the fuck up, huh?

40:43.874 --> 40:45.074
Malaka.

40:45.674 --> 40:47.574
No, it's cool. He's cool.

40:48.974 --> 40:51.674
-That's Frank's kid?
-Yeah.

40:51.974 --> 40:53.474
He's in the Union, you know.

40:53.574 --> 40:57.074
But he's like an L-series,
so he ain't getting any hours.

41:04.076 --> 41:08.277
-Same deal, same rate.
-All right. Who's driving?

41:10.277 --> 41:11.477
Again?

41:14.077 --> 41:15.777
You want to mix it up a little more.

41:15.877 --> 41:18.777
Make it so customs doesn't put
no names to faces.

41:19.277 --> 41:21.778
You trust a man, you stay with him.

41:25.878 --> 41:27.478
-Okay.
-All right.

41:27.778 --> 41:29.278
Boris it is.

41:29.378 --> 41:31.279
-Sergei.
-Yeah, whatever.

41:33.079 --> 41:34.479
Come on, fucknuts. Let's go.

41:34.579 --> 41:37.380
-How's the open-face turkey?
-It's shit. Let's go.

41:37.880 --> 41:39.580
See you guys later.

41:43.681 --> 41:47.080
-Bullwinkle?
-Polacks.

41:47.980 --> 41:50.781
You fucking embarrassed me in there, man.

41:52.681 --> 41:54.881
You embarrassed yourself, Zig.

42:08.683 --> 42:10.784
You seen my nephew anywhere?

42:11.884 --> 42:15.884
Nick? Not yet.
I don't think he got any hours.

42:32.386 --> 42:34.486
-Hey, Frank.
-Hey, darling.

42:34.787 --> 42:39.287
Just so I can finish my paperwork early,
what are your people gonna steal today?

42:39.387 --> 42:40.686
I don't know.

42:40.786 --> 42:44.587
Couple luxury sedans,
some color TVs, wide-screen.

42:44.687 --> 42:48.388
Maybe a couple cans of vodka,
maybe a whole container ship.

42:48.588 --> 42:50.987
Okay. Y'all have a good one.

42:56.188 --> 42:58.189
You let her fuck with you like that?

42:58.389 --> 43:00.789
She's all right. I like her.

43:14.990 --> 43:18.791
I checked the computer.
It's Bay 9, Cell 1 1 . It's right on the bottom.

43:20.091 --> 43:22.791
-You working the light, ain't you?
-I'm on it, yeah.

43:22.891 --> 43:26.892
-Did they say anything else?
-No. Just that it's the same money to us.

43:30.092 --> 43:31.292
Let's go.

43:32.093 --> 43:33.893
All right, Uncle Frank.

43:35.793 --> 43:38.392
-Winona.
-Jimmy, where you been?

43:50.695 --> 43:52.695
Look who it is. Sailor Boy.

43:52.795 --> 43:54.796
-You owe me $10.
-Fuck you.

43:55.295 --> 43:58.495
You told Rawls where I didn't wanna go.
You made it happen, Jay.

43:58.695 --> 44:02.695
-I told him where you didn't wanna go.
-Yeah, and they sent me there.

44:02.896 --> 44:05.496
I knew Rawls was pissed,
I didn't know how pissed.

44:05.596 --> 44:07.296
What can I tell you?

44:08.596 --> 44:12.297
-Where's Bunk?
-Out on a call with Crutchfield.

44:13.897 --> 44:16.498
What's up with the girl?
She come off the bridge or what?

44:16.598 --> 44:20.198
Doc Frazier posted her today.
Blunt-force trauma to the head and chest.

44:20.297 --> 44:22.298
He says she's dead
before she hits the water.

44:22.398 --> 44:24.599
What about the defense wounds?

44:24.999 --> 44:28.099
Bruising on three fingers?
We saw that as soon as we picked her up.

44:28.199 --> 44:29.999
You missed the defense wounds?

44:30.099 --> 44:32.498
I wasn't looking.
Thought she went off the bridge.

44:32.599 --> 44:34.799
Also, she's in the drink
with no coat or shoes.

44:34.899 --> 44:37.399
Maybe that stuff comes off in the water,
maybe not.

44:37.499 --> 44:40.699
I don't see her going to the bridge in winter
dressed like she was.

44:40.800 --> 44:42.700
But then that's just me.

44:43.000 --> 44:44.500
Tell Bunk I was here, will you?

44:44.600 --> 44:45.800
Have fun.

44:45.900 --> 44:49.501
We already had our fun.
Dumping her on Baltimore County.

44:51.702 --> 44:53.102
On the County?

44:53.902 --> 44:57.901
You fished her out east of the bridge.
That's Baltimore County. She's their stat.

44:58.001 --> 45:01.102
-You sold them on that?
-Rawls did.

45:01.702 --> 45:03.502
He called up the Colonel and said:

45:03.602 --> 45:06.402
"You got one hell of a murder
on your hands."

45:08.003 --> 45:10.704
It's all about self-preservation, Jimmy.

45:11.803 --> 45:13.704
Something you never learned.

45:14.204 --> 45:16.604
Hey, Norris. State Police, Line 2.

45:20.505 --> 45:22.105
A little to the right!

45:22.905 --> 45:24.704
Good, bring her down!

45:56.208 --> 45:58.309
It's there whenever they want it.

46:07.510 --> 46:09.810
Now that you are my client, Mr. Bell...

46:09.910 --> 46:12.710
we are protected
by the attorney-client privilege.

46:12.810 --> 46:15.811
-I thought Roberto would be here.
-Not likely.

46:16.011 --> 46:18.811
This, I'm afraid, was in Monday's papers.

46:21.311 --> 46:25.512
It seems Roberto Castellano y Silva
has been targeted by the DEA.

46:26.612 --> 46:28.412
That's why we didn't do the business?

46:28.512 --> 46:32.912
Right now, Roberto and his people aren't
going to be getting involved in anything...

46:33.012 --> 46:35.313
that could further complicate the situation.

46:35.413 --> 46:38.714
You know, usually, when you take a fall,
you get right back in there...

46:38.814 --> 46:42.014
-'cause you know nobody's watching, right?
-Sometimes.

46:42.214 --> 46:45.914
And sometimes you wonder
how it is you got caught in the first place.

46:46.014 --> 46:48.614
And you decide to change the pattern.

46:49.114 --> 46:50.214
He took our money?

46:50.414 --> 46:53.414
Your advance payment arrived
as our problem did.

46:53.515 --> 46:56.415
And I'm told the money
is on the way back to Baltimore.

46:56.515 --> 46:59.016
You know, I get the feeling
that you're blaming us...

46:59.116 --> 47:01.616
for Roberto's predicament.

47:01.916 --> 47:05.917
Perhaps your problems in Baltimore
and my client's problems here...

47:06.017 --> 47:07.617
are coincidental.

47:07.717 --> 47:09.617
-But right now--
-Listen to me.

47:09.817 --> 47:11.916
He was the first to know that we took a hit.

47:12.016 --> 47:14.217
He knows no one came close
to rolling over us...

47:14.317 --> 47:16.717
and all the documents from the case.

47:17.517 --> 47:21.418
Nonetheless, we have a legitimate concern.

47:23.018 --> 47:26.419
Considering the scope
of Mr. Barksdale's operation...

47:26.519 --> 47:30.120
his sentence was, to say the least, mild.

47:31.319 --> 47:34.820
But if the possibility exists,
however unlikely...

47:35.419 --> 47:39.620
that the leniency he received
was the result of cooperation....

47:41.520 --> 47:44.820
You understand our position, I'm sure.

47:52.022 --> 47:53.921
Frank, it's sitting out there waiting...

47:54.021 --> 47:56.122
and this Russian fuck
won't take it off the pier.

47:56.222 --> 47:57.223
I ain't blind.

47:57.322 --> 47:59.522
I don't like it
sitting out in the open that long.

47:59.622 --> 48:02.123
The customs seal is broke.
Somebody's gonna see it.

48:02.223 --> 48:04.423
Our asses are hanging out here.

48:15.324 --> 48:17.824
-Yeah?
-Nicky, what the fuck? It's still here.

48:17.924 --> 48:19.524
-Shit.
-Yeah.

48:19.624 --> 48:22.125
-Where's Sergei?
-He's parked at the end of the lot.

48:22.225 --> 48:24.825
-What's he waiting for?
-I got no fucking idea.

48:24.925 --> 48:28.025
But the ship's almost empty.
They need to shit or get off the pot.

48:28.125 --> 48:30.126
-I'll look into it.
-Yeah.

48:32.226 --> 48:34.026
Okay, I understand.

48:55.429 --> 48:59.329
Fuck it. Get it on a fifth wheel
and lose it in the stack. We're at risk.

50:09.736 --> 50:13.137
I ain't lying when I say
this paperwork is kicking my ass.

50:13.837 --> 50:17.238
Maybe so. But the end of the day,
you come through the door in one piece.

50:17.338 --> 50:19.138
You like to think so.

50:20.038 --> 50:22.938
But all these paper cuts
are starting to take their toll.

50:23.738 --> 50:27.739
You big, nasty detective. Come here.

50:28.338 --> 50:31.039
Let me give your little boo-boo a kiss.

50:41.141 --> 50:44.341
-All this?
-I'm just getting started.

50:45.141 --> 50:46.841
$1000 for the doctor.

50:46.941 --> 50:50.841
$1000 each time, girlfriend.
Every month till I'm pregnant.

50:52.841 --> 50:54.642
There's gotta be a better way.

50:55.042 --> 50:57.041
That would be on you, sweetheart.

50:57.141 --> 51:00.442
Come up with a suitable donor
and we pay a lot less.

51:01.543 --> 51:04.343
Not with your pussy
would I fuck anyone of these guys.

51:04.443 --> 51:07.643
What did you just say?
No, you didn't just say that.

51:37.846 --> 51:39.247
Sergeant.

51:40.648 --> 51:42.548
Your floater's come back.

51:43.847 --> 51:46.447
County boys are putting her
on our side of the bridge.

51:46.547 --> 51:48.447
-No fucking way.
-Yeah.

51:48.848 --> 51:51.648
Some useless fuck in our Marine Unit
faxed them a report...

51:51.748 --> 51:54.249
on the early morning tides
and wind currents.

51:54.449 --> 51:57.849
Shows the body went in the water
west of the bridge and drifted out.

51:57.949 --> 51:59.549
McNulty.

52:01.549 --> 52:04.650
Fucking Jimmy.
Fucking with us for the fun of it.

52:05.150 --> 52:09.050
I gotta give the son of a bitch
some credit for wit on this one.

52:10.450 --> 52:13.850
-Cocksucker.
-Motherfucker.

52:31.153 --> 52:33.153
The count is right. What's on the shelf?

52:33.253 --> 52:37.153
Mace carrying 10 down here.
So, Moe Man holding about 38 up top.

52:37.253 --> 52:40.153
I checked the stash, and we way low.

52:40.254 --> 52:42.253
-Moe Man taking our shit.
-What he holding?

52:42.353 --> 52:45.454
He say he holds about 30-something,
but I know that ain't right.

52:45.553 --> 52:47.055
I'm gonna fuck him up.

52:47.155 --> 52:49.254
First thing you think to do
is fuck a nigger up.

52:49.354 --> 52:52.055
When your brick brain gonna realize
there's more to this...

52:52.155 --> 52:54.255
than just thumpin' on niggers?

52:54.355 --> 52:57.356
-What Moe supposed to be holding?
-38, thereabout.

52:57.555 --> 53:00.356
-Ain't you the damn fool?
-But then we low.

53:00.456 --> 53:03.457
Look, nigger, if we low,
it 'cause String want us that way.

53:03.557 --> 53:07.256
When he wants us up, we be up.
String is on top of the shit.

53:07.656 --> 53:09.656
He on top of everything.

53:11.457 --> 53:13.457
Go back to your spot, man.

53:23.659 --> 53:25.259
Fucking McNulty.

53:28.259 --> 53:30.059
The Prince of Tides.

55:41.174 --> 55:43.175
-Brother, you feeling strong today?
-Yeah.

55:43.375 --> 55:45.875
See if you can get his ass out of that chair.

55:47.774 --> 55:50.574
He said it was fine
if you wanted to hit him, too.

55:51.375 --> 55:54.575
What's the first thing a guy from Local 47
does after he gets laid?

55:54.675 --> 55:57.575
-What?
-Wipes the pepper spray from his eyes.

55:59.376 --> 56:01.776
Hey, Frank. Something's going on.

56:51.781 --> 56:55.482
-It's fucking girls, man. Young ones.
