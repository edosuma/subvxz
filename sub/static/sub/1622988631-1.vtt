[alarm beeping]

00:31.699 --> 00:35.452
[birds singing]

00:35.577 --> 00:37.913
[woman on phone]

00:35.577 --> 00:37.913
<i>Laura, it's fine, I'll see you</i>

00:35.577 --> 00:37.913
<i>at the office.</i>

00:38.038 --> 00:39.289
I'll be there soon.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.795
-[man] Morning, Chip.

00:42.584 --> 00:44.795
-Hey, man!

00:47.673 --> 00:50.217
-Morning, Laura.

00:47.673 --> 00:50.217
-Morning, Frank.

00:50.342 --> 00:53.470
Oh! I heard you pulled out

00:50.342 --> 00:53.470
all the stops to save

00:50.342 --> 00:53.470
the Peterson account.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.389
They'll have to make you

00:53.595 --> 00:55.389
partner now.

00:55.514 --> 00:58.141
I hope so. There's a lot

00:55.514 --> 00:58.141
of changes I'd like to make.

00:58.266 --> 01:01.395
Like getting you that raise

00:58.266 --> 01:01.395
you should've gotten last year.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.411
Congratulations, Laura.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.411
You did it.

01:17.536 --> 01:19.621
Oh, I'd like to review the

01:17.536 --> 01:19.621
contract one last time, Fiona.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.123
Laura, it's perfect,

01:19.747 --> 01:22.123
they've signed it. It's done.

01:22.249 --> 01:25.210
-They've signed it? Already?

01:22.249 --> 01:25.210
-Yes, it's time to celebrate.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.756
So as your boss,

01:25.335 --> 01:28.756
I am ordering you to brag.

01:28.881 --> 01:31.926
Tell everyone how you did it.

01:32.051 --> 01:35.345
Well, Mr. Peterson might run

01:32.051 --> 01:35.345
an international corporation,

01:35.470 --> 01:37.556
but he's a local

01:35.470 --> 01:37.556
businessman at heart.

01:37.681 --> 01:40.308
I explained the opportunity

01:37.681 --> 01:40.308
in local expansion

01:40.434 --> 01:41.936
and persuaded him not to sell.

01:42.061 --> 01:45.480
Local expansion worth

01:42.061 --> 01:45.480
250 million.

01:45.606 --> 01:46.648
[man] Wow.

01:46.774 --> 01:49.192
[employees applauding]

01:49.317 --> 01:51.528
He wanted what was best

01:49.317 --> 01:51.528
for the community.

01:51.653 --> 01:53.822
I just helped him to see that.

01:53.948 --> 01:56.283
Laura, you're always

01:53.948 --> 01:56.283
so modest.

01:56.408 --> 01:58.660
It's all thanks

01:56.408 --> 01:58.660
to my lucky charm.

01:58.786 --> 02:01.538
Because the long hours

01:58.786 --> 02:01.538
and late nights

02:01.663 --> 02:03.582
had nothing to do with it.

02:04.917 --> 02:06.835
On an entirely

02:04.917 --> 02:06.835
different subject,

02:06.961 --> 02:08.796
what do you know

02:06.961 --> 02:08.796
about Graham Finley?

02:08.921 --> 02:11.924
Graham Finley,

02:08.921 --> 02:11.924
billionaire, highly educated,

02:12.049 --> 02:14.259
international property

02:12.049 --> 02:14.259
developer,

02:14.384 --> 02:17.012
terrible at coconut toss.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.682
I told you that I grew up

02:17.137 --> 02:20.682
in Sapphire Cove until I was 12.

02:20.808 --> 02:24.061
Your idyllic childhood

02:20.808 --> 02:24.061
on a tropical island.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.813
How could I forget?

02:25.938 --> 02:27.314
I grew up with the Finley's.

02:27.439 --> 02:31.276
His grandson Chip was

02:27.439 --> 02:31.276
my best friend.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.236
We lost touch though.

02:33.361 --> 02:39.743
-Ah. That explains it.

02:33.361 --> 02:39.743
-Explains what?

02:39.868 --> 02:42.579
Why there's a billionaire

02:39.868 --> 02:42.579
in my office.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.915
Waiting for you.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.003
[Fiona] Mr. Finley.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.463
Laura Price.

02:51.588 --> 02:55.467
My goodness. All grown up.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.928
Mr. Finley, it's

02:55.592 --> 02:57.928
so wonderful to see you again.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.472
I remember when you

02:58.053 --> 03:00.472
and my grandson

03:00.597 --> 03:03.017
filled my Mercedes with seaweed.

03:03.142 --> 03:06.103
So it's a bit late

03:03.142 --> 03:06.103
for "Mr. Finley" now.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.271
Please.

03:08.396 --> 03:10.691
Well, I've heard

03:08.396 --> 03:10.691
all about your achievements

03:10.816 --> 03:12.400
from Mrs. Wilde here.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.444
The valedictorian.

03:14.569 --> 03:18.115
A portfolio

03:14.569 --> 03:18.115
of high-profile clients.

03:18.239 --> 03:20.492
A promotion waiting

03:18.239 --> 03:20.492
in the wings.

03:20.617 --> 03:23.829
You've certainly made your mark

03:20.617 --> 03:23.829
since leaving Sapphire Cove.

03:23.954 --> 03:26.373
Well, it's not as

03:23.954 --> 03:26.373
impressive as your legacy

03:26.498 --> 03:29.001
but I'm not finished yet.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.963
That's the Laura I remember.

03:29.126 --> 03:32.963
Ambitious and determined.

03:33.088 --> 03:36.800
You may not have noticed, Laura,

03:33.088 --> 03:36.800
but I've gotten old.

03:36.925 --> 03:39.553
I'm 85 soon.

03:39.678 --> 03:42.389
85 is a significant

03:39.678 --> 03:42.389
milestone, Mr. Finley.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.474
You see, I am CEO

03:42.514 --> 03:44.474
of the company

03:44.599 --> 03:47.936
until the day I choose

03:44.599 --> 03:47.936
to step down or...

03:48.062 --> 03:50.564
Or your 85th birthday,

03:48.062 --> 03:50.564
whichever comes first.

03:50.689 --> 03:52.440
Whichever comes first.

03:52.566 --> 03:54.693
The mandatory

03:52.566 --> 03:54.693
retirement clause.

03:54.818 --> 03:56.111
Retirement clauses

03:56.236 --> 03:59.031
are notoriously difficult

03:56.236 --> 03:59.031
to outmaneuver.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.366
Oh, it's much too late

03:59.156 --> 04:01.366
for any of that.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.578
My son was not a good fit.

04:04.703 --> 04:07.247
But it's not too late

04:04.703 --> 04:07.247
for my grandson.

04:07.372 --> 04:10.042
I want to name Chip my successor

04:10.167 --> 04:13.879
because it's my last chance to

04:10.167 --> 04:13.879
keep my business in the family.

04:14.004 --> 04:19.676
So he needs to sign on the

04:14.004 --> 04:19.676
dotted line before I turn 85.

04:19.801 --> 04:22.221
Laura can draw up

04:19.801 --> 04:22.221
a contract immediately.

04:22.345 --> 04:26.100
Good, because I need

04:22.345 --> 04:26.100
you to take it to him

04:26.225 --> 04:27.851
and get him to sign it.

04:27.976 --> 04:33.815
We don't have a lot of time here

04:27.976 --> 04:33.815
and he can be a little stubborn.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.484
You're the only one

04:33.941 --> 04:36.484
he's ever listened to.

04:36.610 --> 04:39.029
She'd be delighted to take

04:36.610 --> 04:39.029
the contract to Chip.

04:39.154 --> 04:43.700
Of course. Where exactly

04:39.154 --> 04:43.700
is Chip living these days?

04:44.826 --> 04:46.286
Well...

04:46.411 --> 04:47.621
Sapphire Cove?

04:47.746 --> 04:50.249
Now? I can't go now.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.249
It's been forever.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.292
I haven't spoken to Chip

04:50.373 --> 04:52.292
since I was a kid.

04:52.417 --> 04:54.086
I didn't even know

04:52.417 --> 04:54.086
what he looks like.

04:54.211 --> 04:56.004
Well, don't over

04:54.211 --> 04:56.004
complicate it.

04:56.130 --> 04:59.133
You fly over, find Chip,

04:56.130 --> 04:59.133
get the contract signed

04:59.258 --> 05:01.218
and you'll be back

04:59.258 --> 05:01.218
in a few days.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.178
Fiona, I have

05:01.342 --> 05:03.178
so much work to do,

05:03.303 --> 05:04.888
I'm going to be working late

05:03.303 --> 05:04.888
as it is.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.723
Why don't you take Owen?

05:06.848 --> 05:09.559
You two can spend some time

05:06.848 --> 05:09.559
together before the big day.

05:09.684 --> 05:11.686
Actually, we decided to push

05:09.684 --> 05:11.686
the date back again.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.896
Again?

05:13.021 --> 05:15.190
I know... We've been so busy.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.318
Besides, I thought that

05:15.315 --> 05:18.318
I would hear about

05:15.315 --> 05:18.318
the partnership soon.

05:18.443 --> 05:22.823
We're still in talks.

05:18.443 --> 05:22.823
It's down to you and Simon.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.452
-Simon?

05:24.783 --> 05:27.452
-Mmm-hm.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.956
He brings in big clients.

05:27.577 --> 05:30.956
That means big money.

05:31.081 --> 05:32.624
But what about my local

05:31.081 --> 05:32.624
business plan?

05:32.749 --> 05:34.375
Yeah, yeah, they loved it.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.171
More face-to-face time

05:34.501 --> 05:37.171
with clients,

05:37.296 --> 05:39.214
protect small businesses.

05:37.296 --> 05:39.214
They ate it up.

05:39.338 --> 05:43.927
But at the end of the day,

05:39.338 --> 05:43.927
money talks.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.596
Graham came to you for a reason.

05:46.721 --> 05:48.389
He really thinks

05:46.721 --> 05:48.389
you can persuade Chip.

05:48.515 --> 05:51.185
Bringing in a client

05:48.515 --> 05:51.185
like Graham Finley

05:51.310 --> 05:53.061
might just be the edge you need.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.480
-Do you think so?

05:53.187 --> 05:55.480
-I know so.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.692
Besides, there are worse places

05:55.605 --> 05:58.692
to end up

05:58.817 --> 06:01.278
than on a tropical island.

06:01.402 --> 06:05.907
Fine print is my specialty.

06:01.402 --> 06:05.907
Yeah, alright, fantastic.

06:06.033 --> 06:09.577
Honey, I am so sorry.

06:06.033 --> 06:09.577
I'm so snowed under right now.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.412
What were we talking about?

06:11.538 --> 06:14.082
We were talking

06:11.538 --> 06:14.082
about Sapphire Cove.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.917
Yes, yes, your hometown.

06:16.043 --> 06:17.252
I haven't been there

06:16.043 --> 06:17.252
since I was a kid.

06:17.376 --> 06:20.421
But this work thing

06:17.376 --> 06:20.421
kind of popped up

06:20.547 --> 06:25.177
and I thought that maybe

06:20.547 --> 06:25.177
we could go there together.

06:25.302 --> 06:26.845
Once I get this contract signed

06:26.970 --> 06:30.431
then we can just relax for once

06:26.970 --> 06:30.431
and it might be nice.

06:30.557 --> 06:33.185
I don't know, honey. I could

06:30.557 --> 06:33.185
really use the extra hours

06:30.557 --> 06:33.185
around the office right now.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.853
I just have to go there

06:34.978 --> 06:36.938
and get Chip Finley to sign

06:34.978 --> 06:36.938
this contract in person

06:37.064 --> 06:39.482
and then if all goes well,

06:39.607 --> 06:44.612
I might get the whole

06:39.607 --> 06:44.612
Finley account.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.448
You will get the whole

06:44.738 --> 06:47.448
Finley account.

06:47.574 --> 06:49.784
This is the big leagues now,

06:47.574 --> 06:49.784
honey.

06:49.910 --> 06:53.330
Look, I know you love

06:49.910 --> 06:53.330
all that charity work

06:49.910 --> 06:53.330
you're doing, but...

06:53.454 --> 06:56.166
Giving smaller clients more

06:53.454 --> 06:56.166
time isn't exactly charity work.

06:56.291 --> 06:58.752
It's what legal representation

06:56.291 --> 06:58.752
is meant to be about.

06:58.877 --> 07:00.712
Honey, remember, we're sharks.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.673
And think of this Finley

07:00.837 --> 07:03.673
account as your prey.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.219
We are always hunting.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.219
Keeping our eye on the prize.

07:07.344 --> 07:10.513
And then when

07:07.344 --> 07:10.513
it's in our sights...

07:10.638 --> 07:13.892
...that's when we pounce.

07:14.017 --> 07:17.771
Well, let's hope

07:14.017 --> 07:17.771
that Chip Finley

07:14.017 --> 07:17.771
isn't too hard to hunt down.

07:17.896 --> 07:18.855
You'll be great.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.155
[pilot]<i> Welcome</i>

07:25.528 --> 07:27.155
<i>to Sapphire Cove</i>

07:27.281 --> 07:29.324
<i>where the local time</i>

07:27.281 --> 07:29.324
<i>is 8:02 a.m.</i>

07:38.166 --> 07:40.919
Welcome to Sapphire Cove.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.919
If you make your way

07:38.166 --> 07:40.919
down to the pier,

07:41.044 --> 07:43.546
our captain is waiting

07:41.044 --> 07:43.546
to take you to the hotel.

07:43.671 --> 07:45.424
The captain?

07:45.548 --> 07:46.425
After you.

07:56.768 --> 07:58.937
[Laura] Well, this is one way

07:56.768 --> 07:58.937
to get around.

07:59.062 --> 08:00.397
Sure beats rush-hour traffic.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.150
-First time to the island?

08:00.563 --> 08:03.150
-Uh... No.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.110
But it's been a very long time.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.154
Well, better late than never.

08:07.279 --> 08:10.490
Let me guess. Lawyer.

08:10.615 --> 08:12.326
Oh! That obvious?

08:12.451 --> 08:14.828
Not everybody gets so dressed

08:12.451 --> 08:14.828
up to come on vacation.

08:14.953 --> 08:20.917
Right. Well, my turn.

08:14.953 --> 08:20.917
You must be... the captain.

08:21.835 --> 08:24.338
[scoffs] Lucky guess.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.588
-Dude...

08:24.463 --> 08:25.588
-What?

08:25.713 --> 08:28.967
-Your shirt!

08:25.713 --> 08:28.967
-Oh! Oh.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.178
[Chip]

08:29.092 --> 08:31.178
You could've told me earlier!

08:48.028 --> 08:50.197
There we go.

08:50.322 --> 08:52.991
[man] Welcome to the Royal

08:50.322 --> 08:52.991
Hotel. Mind your step.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.784
[woman] Welcome. Sparkling wine?

08:54.909 --> 08:55.910
[mumbling]

08:56.036 --> 08:59.206
Hi. How are you?

08:56.036 --> 08:59.206
So have a good trip.

08:59.331 --> 09:01.291
If you can, treat yourself

08:59.331 --> 09:01.291
to a pair of sandals.

09:01.416 --> 09:03.877
I hear they're much more

09:01.416 --> 09:03.877
comfortable than heels.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.087
I might just do that.

09:04.002 --> 09:06.087
Thank you.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.089
And if you need someone to

09:06.213 --> 09:08.089
take you around the island,

09:08.215 --> 09:09.632
we do offer guided tours.

09:09.757 --> 09:11.843
Actually, you might be

09:09.757 --> 09:11.843
able to help me...

09:11.968 --> 09:13.345
-Yoo-hoo.

09:11.968 --> 09:13.345
-What?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.805
Anybody home?

09:15.930 --> 09:17.724
-Welcome drink, ma'am?

09:15.930 --> 09:17.724
-Oh. Thank you.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.017
Take the bag!

09:19.142 --> 09:20.394
[Laura] Thank you.

09:20.519 --> 09:24.064
When you book at

09:20.519 --> 09:24.064
the front desk ask for Chip.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.024
Chip?

09:30.320 --> 09:32.447
[woman 2] This way, please.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.615
Your bag will be delivered

09:32.572 --> 09:34.615
straight to your room.

10:05.397 --> 10:11.445
"Dear Laura... A little taste of

10:05.397 --> 10:11.445
the high life. Enjoy. Fiona."

10:11.570 --> 10:13.029
Where's the Wi-Fi password?

10:13.154 --> 10:15.115
-[knock at the door]

10:13.154 --> 10:15.115
-[Gem] Laura?

10:15.240 --> 10:17.700
-I haven't seen you in so long.

10:15.240 --> 10:17.700
-Gem!

10:19.869 --> 10:21.662
When I saw your name

10:19.869 --> 10:21.662
on the reservation,

10:21.788 --> 10:23.831
I couldn't believe it.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.831
You came back.

10:23.957 --> 10:26.667
I did. It's been forever.

10:26.793 --> 10:30.589
Gosh, look at you all

10:26.793 --> 10:30.589
fancy and grown-up.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.424
Oh, yes, well,

10:30.713 --> 10:32.424
as assistant manager

10:32.549 --> 10:34.884
of the Royal Hotel, please

10:32.549 --> 10:34.884
do not hesitate to let me know

10:35.009 --> 10:37.387
if there is anything I can do to

10:35.009 --> 10:37.387
make your stay more enjoyable.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.765
Oh, I love this suite, by

10:37.512 --> 10:40.765
the way. It is my favorite.

10:40.890 --> 10:45.312
It's magnificent. I mean,

10:40.890 --> 10:45.312
this whole resort is incredible.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.022
Oh, that's right.

10:45.437 --> 10:48.022
You didn't live here

10:45.437 --> 10:48.022
when it was getting built.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.857
Well, it's all courtesy

10:48.148 --> 10:49.857
of Finley developments.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.901
[giggles] We have

10:49.983 --> 10:51.901
so much to catch up on.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.778
There is a ton to do

10:52.026 --> 10:53.778
around the island

10:53.903 --> 10:56.239
and of course Graham's birthday

10:53.903 --> 10:56.239
celebration's this weekend.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.991
It is the event of the summer

10:58.116 --> 10:59.951
and I have my eye on

10:58.116 --> 10:59.951
the general manager position.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.536
So if all goes well...

11:02.996 --> 11:06.166
You'll get a promotion?

11:02.996 --> 11:06.166
Ah, that's exciting.

11:06.291 --> 11:08.335
You are staying longer

11:06.291 --> 11:08.335
than three days, right?

11:08.460 --> 11:09.794
This is just a short trip.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.546
Oh, so you're not here

11:09.919 --> 11:11.546
for Graham's party?

11:11.671 --> 11:14.174
Actually, I'm here

11:11.671 --> 11:14.174
to see Chip.

11:14.299 --> 11:17.469
Oh! Oh.

11:19.053 --> 11:21.598
What does "oh" mean?

11:21.722 --> 11:24.725
You don't have a contract

11:21.722 --> 11:24.725
with you, do you?

11:25.519 --> 11:26.478
Maybe.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.525
-Let's get you a coconut.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.525
-Oh!

11:31.650 --> 11:34.944
[Gem] Do you remember how Chip

11:31.650 --> 11:34.944
was when we were kids?

11:35.069 --> 11:39.282
As a 12-year-old? Sure.

11:35.069 --> 11:39.282
Stubborn, sweet.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.827
Always took it badly

11:39.407 --> 11:42.827
when he lost at coconut toss.

11:42.952 --> 11:44.829
I'm sure he's grown up

11:42.952 --> 11:44.829
since then.

11:44.954 --> 11:46.414
Eh...

11:46.540 --> 11:49.125
I did see him on the boat

11:46.540 --> 11:49.125
from the airport

11:49.250 --> 11:52.711
and he looked pretty

11:49.250 --> 11:52.711
grown up to me.

11:52.837 --> 11:55.215
-Mmmm,

11:52.837 --> 11:55.215
-He didn't recognize me though.

11:55.340 --> 11:57.509
You two always had

11:55.340 --> 11:57.509
a thing for each other.

11:57.634 --> 12:01.971
-Oh, please, we were 12.

11:57.634 --> 12:01.971
-I know!

12:02.096 --> 12:04.599
Anyway, I think you'll find

12:02.096 --> 12:04.599
the new Chip and the old Chip

12:04.723 --> 12:06.560
have a lot in common.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.895
What's your strategy?

12:09.020 --> 12:12.982
Well, I guess if he's the old

12:09.020 --> 12:12.982
Chip then I better be

12:09.020 --> 12:12.982
the old Laura.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.568
And if he still doesn't

12:13.107 --> 12:14.568
recognize me

12:14.693 --> 12:17.820
then we've got an advantage.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.407
Should we have some fun with

12:17.945 --> 12:20.407
him like old times?

12:20.532 --> 12:22.242
Definitely.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.208
[Chip] Come on. You got this.

12:27.830 --> 12:30.208
Big throw.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.751
Ooh! That's too bad.

12:32.877 --> 12:36.047
That's too bad. Guess it's my

12:32.877 --> 12:36.047
turn. All right. You'll get it.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.924
-Hey, Chip.

12:36.172 --> 12:37.924
-Hey. Oh!

12:38.049 --> 12:40.009
Showing the legal eagle

12:38.049 --> 12:40.009
around, are you, Gem?

12:40.134 --> 12:41.678
I got good news for you.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.678
You're in luck.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.972
Just in time to see me beat

12:41.802 --> 12:44.972
Karavi at coconut toss again!

12:45.098 --> 12:47.016
Can't wait.

12:47.141 --> 12:48.767
He's certainly the

12:47.141 --> 12:48.767
same old Chip.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.437
Yep.

12:50.562 --> 12:53.440
You've lost your heels

12:50.562 --> 12:53.440
already. Island life suits you.

12:54.357 --> 12:55.900
Let's do this.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.112
All right. Here we go.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.112
[indistinct]

13:02.907 --> 13:04.075
-[Gem] Woo!

13:02.907 --> 13:04.075
-Boom. All right.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.869
Thanks very much, thank you.

13:04.200 --> 13:06.869
Thank you very much.

13:06.994 --> 13:08.496
You ready for this?

13:08.622 --> 13:10.081
I guess we should go

13:08.622 --> 13:10.081
get a contract signed.

13:10.206 --> 13:11.374
Let's do it.

13:11.499 --> 13:15.545
You win some, you lose some.

13:11.499 --> 13:15.545
Good game, buddy.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.756
Oh, you must be here

13:15.670 --> 13:17.756
for that island tour.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.091
She's not here for a tour.

13:20.216 --> 13:23.928
Actually, your grandfather

13:20.216 --> 13:23.928
is my client.

13:24.053 --> 13:25.346
He asked me to bring you this.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.267
Ha-ha.

13:25.472 --> 13:29.267
Well, that's too bad.

13:29.392 --> 13:30.769
I'm sorry you came all

13:29.392 --> 13:30.769
this way,

13:30.893 --> 13:33.688
but I have no interest in

13:30.893 --> 13:33.688
becoming the next CEO

13:33.812 --> 13:36.399
of Finley Developments.

13:36.524 --> 13:39.569
You sure I can't convince

13:36.524 --> 13:39.569
you to just read it?

13:39.694 --> 13:41.820
Look, I'm sure you're

13:39.694 --> 13:41.820
very good at what you do,

13:41.946 --> 13:44.324
but if all those lawyers

13:41.946 --> 13:44.324
my granddad sent over

13:44.449 --> 13:46.660
can't get me to even

13:44.449 --> 13:46.660
look at it,

13:46.785 --> 13:48.787
I'm afraid you're

13:46.785 --> 13:48.787
wasting your time.

13:48.911 --> 13:51.623
Thanks for coming.

13:51.748 --> 13:55.627
Mmm? What's this... what's this

13:51.748 --> 13:55.627
game you're playing here?

13:55.752 --> 13:57.128
This game?

13:57.253 --> 13:59.422
Only the greatest

13:57.253 --> 13:59.422
game in Sapphire Cove.

13:59.547 --> 14:01.090
This is coconut toss.

14:01.215 --> 14:03.510
Why, you want to take on the

14:01.215 --> 14:03.510
undefeated champion himself?

14:03.635 --> 14:05.844
Oh, I mean, that's tempting,

14:05.970 --> 14:09.432
but this looks way too

14:05.970 --> 14:09.432
complicated for me.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.727
All right, well, suit yourself.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.727
Enjoy the island.

14:12.851 --> 14:16.314
I tell you what,

14:12.851 --> 14:16.314
I'll make you a deal.

14:17.440 --> 14:20.527
I will play you at coconut toss

14:20.652 --> 14:24.739
and if I win,

14:20.652 --> 14:24.739
you have to hear me out.

14:26.199 --> 14:27.908
And if I win?

14:28.034 --> 14:31.078
Oh, I will tear up this

14:28.034 --> 14:31.078
contract right in front of you.

14:31.204 --> 14:33.873
[laughs] Oh, you

14:31.204 --> 14:33.873
got yourself a deal.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.083
-All right.

14:33.998 --> 14:36.083
-I'll set it up.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.294
OK.

14:41.756 --> 14:44.342
Laura, Chip's gotten really

14:41.756 --> 14:44.342
good at this game.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.845
Good thing I got

14:44.467 --> 14:46.845
my lucky charm.

14:49.055 --> 14:51.098
So the rules are simple,

14:51.224 --> 14:53.434
but the game gets a little

14:51.224 --> 14:53.434
harder as you go along.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.935
You hit a coconut, you go again.

14:55.061 --> 14:56.437
You miss, the other person

14:55.061 --> 14:56.437
gets a shot.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.272
Whoever hits the most

14:56.563 --> 14:58.272
wins the game.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.107
So ladies first. It's only fair.

15:01.484 --> 15:02.527
Ooh.

15:04.111 --> 15:05.238
-[Laura] Whoo!

15:04.111 --> 15:05.238
-Wow.

15:05.363 --> 15:07.532
Good... good shot.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.743
I mean, I heard that the first

15:07.657 --> 15:09.743
one is the easiest.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.202
-Mmm, good shot.

15:09.868 --> 15:11.202
-So...

15:14.497 --> 15:16.583
[Laura] Yes.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.918
-Beginners luck?

15:16.708 --> 15:18.918
-Yeah, I'll say.

15:22.380 --> 15:23.964
[crowd exclaims]

15:24.090 --> 15:25.007
[Chip] Nice shot!

15:25.132 --> 15:27.802
-Who is this girl?

15:25.132 --> 15:27.802
-You'll see.

15:31.931 --> 15:34.392
-Oh! Yeah!

15:31.931 --> 15:34.392
-[applause]

15:35.518 --> 15:36.436
Whoa!

15:36.561 --> 15:37.896
Ladies and gentlemen,

15:38.020 --> 15:42.191
has the unbeaten Chip Finley

15:38.020 --> 15:42.191
finally met his match?

15:42.316 --> 15:47.154
The question on everyone's mind

15:42.316 --> 15:47.154
is will the newcomer

15:47.280 --> 15:50.533
topple the undefeated Chip

15:47.280 --> 15:50.533
Finley's coconut-toss reign?

15:50.658 --> 15:51.992
Would you stop?

15:52.118 --> 15:54.621
[Gem]

15:52.118 --> 15:54.621
If you can't stand the heat,

15:52.118 --> 15:54.621
get out of the fire.

15:54.746 --> 15:56.372
Hey, you, are you sure

15:56.497 --> 15:59.834
that you have not played

15:56.497 --> 15:59.834
this game before?

15:59.959 --> 16:03.880
You know what?

15:59.959 --> 16:03.880
I might have played it once or

15:59.959 --> 16:03.880
twice as a kid. Can't be sure.

16:05.047 --> 16:06.758
You're a lawyer, right?

16:06.883 --> 16:09.302
Is it too late to renegotiate

16:06.883 --> 16:09.302
the bet?

16:09.427 --> 16:14.140
I'm thinking if I lose... Hmm...

16:16.601 --> 16:20.605
I hear you out at a candlelit

16:16.601 --> 16:20.605
dinner under the stars.

16:20.730 --> 16:22.106
-[chuckles]

16:20.730 --> 16:22.106
-Yeah?

16:22.231 --> 16:25.568
Well, I'm not sure that

16:22.231 --> 16:25.568
my fiancé would appreciate that.

16:25.693 --> 16:28.696
Ah-ha. So that

16:25.693 --> 16:28.696
would be a no, right?

16:28.822 --> 16:33.159
Well, no pressure, then.

16:28.822 --> 16:33.159
I mean, you know, big shot and

16:28.822 --> 16:33.159
all. So don't miss.

16:36.746 --> 16:39.999
[cheering and applause]

16:40.124 --> 16:42.752
That's not possible.

16:40.124 --> 16:42.752
Nobody ever hits that shot.

16:50.593 --> 16:54.221
-Undefeated champion, hey?

16:50.593 --> 16:54.221
-I don't understand.

16:54.347 --> 16:57.391
The only person that ever

16:54.347 --> 16:57.391
defeated me at this game is...

16:59.811 --> 17:01.980
Laura? Laura Price?

17:02.104 --> 17:03.773
[both] Surprise.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.654
-I'll have my people

17:06.651 --> 17:09.654
talk to your people.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.654
-Oooh!

17:09.779 --> 17:14.074
No, it's... Oh, that thing

17:09.779 --> 17:14.074
I said. Hang on. Wait a minute.

17:14.200 --> 17:15.075
Hey. Hold up.

17:16.243 --> 17:18.621
Just thought I'd say sorry

17:18.746 --> 17:21.374
for that whole candlelit dinner

17:18.746 --> 17:21.374
with me thing.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.585
-That's embarrassing.

17:21.499 --> 17:24.585
-It's fine. We're old friends.

17:25.837 --> 17:27.421
It's nice to see you again.

17:27.547 --> 17:32.010
You too. Look at you.

17:27.547 --> 17:32.010
Miss Big City Lawyer.

17:32.134 --> 17:34.846
Guess those mock court battles

17:32.134 --> 17:34.846
with me came in handy, huh?

17:34.971 --> 17:36.430
Ha, huge help!

17:36.556 --> 17:38.808
Along with, you know,

17:36.556 --> 17:38.808
a four-year

17:36.556 --> 17:38.808
undergraduate degree,

17:38.933 --> 17:41.143
followed by law school

17:38.933 --> 17:41.143
and then passing the bar exam,

17:41.268 --> 17:44.230
but this is certainly

17:41.268 --> 17:44.230
where it all started.

17:46.065 --> 17:48.150
Your parents must be proud.

17:48.275 --> 17:51.612
They are. Though they

17:48.275 --> 17:51.612
want me to become partner.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.531
Well, Dad does.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.787
-Is he a nice guy?

17:57.451 --> 17:59.787
-My dad?

17:59.913 --> 18:01.330
I mean the guy who put

17:59.913 --> 18:01.330
that ring on your finger.

18:01.455 --> 18:02.874
What did you say his name was?

18:02.999 --> 18:08.379
Ah... Owen. He's really

18:02.999 --> 18:08.379
great. He's a nice guy.

18:08.504 --> 18:11.173
We met at

18:08.504 --> 18:11.173
a Bar Association dinner.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.675
Ooh, power couple, huh?

18:12.800 --> 18:16.637
You could say that.

18:12.800 --> 18:16.637
What about you? Anyone special?

18:16.763 --> 18:21.893
There was once but it's...

18:16.763 --> 18:21.893
It didn't work out.

18:22.018 --> 18:24.186
I guess my expectations

18:22.018 --> 18:24.186
were too high.

18:24.311 --> 18:27.815
-How so?

18:24.311 --> 18:27.815
-Oh, I don't know.

18:27.941 --> 18:33.112
I guess I thought the person

18:27.941 --> 18:33.112
I'd end up with would be

18:27.941 --> 18:33.112
like my best friend.

18:33.237 --> 18:34.614
It's stupid.

18:34.739 --> 18:38.534
Anyway, my work keeps me here

18:34.739 --> 18:38.534
and as you can imagine,

18:38.659 --> 18:40.995
there are not that many

18:38.659 --> 18:40.995
fish in the sea.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.247
Well, you do have a boat.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.751
A captain can sail anywhere

18:43.372 --> 18:46.751
to find love, right?

18:46.876 --> 18:50.797
Yeah, look, the whole

18:46.876 --> 18:50.797
captain thing is really just to

18:46.876 --> 18:50.797
keep the bills paid.

18:50.922 --> 18:53.132
You're worried

18:50.922 --> 18:53.132
about paying your bills?

18:53.257 --> 18:54.634
You do know

18:53.257 --> 18:54.634
that your grandfather

18:54.759 --> 18:56.510
is on the cover

18:54.759 --> 18:56.510
of<i> Business Collective?</i>

18:56.636 --> 19:01.724
It's important to me

18:56.636 --> 19:01.724
that I make my own

18:56.636 --> 19:01.724
way despite my last name.

19:01.849 --> 19:06.896
Besides, I got a side project

19:01.849 --> 19:06.896
that's important to me.

19:07.021 --> 19:09.189
A side project?

19:09.315 --> 19:12.693
I'm building homes for people

19:09.315 --> 19:12.693
who would otherwise

19:09.315 --> 19:12.693
not have a place to call home.

19:12.819 --> 19:15.404
Right, so you are continuing

19:12.819 --> 19:15.404
the family trade!

19:15.529 --> 19:17.281
Not exactly.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.281
It's a charity thing

19:17.406 --> 19:19.325
so it doesn't

19:17.406 --> 19:19.325
have the same profit margin

19:19.450 --> 19:21.160
as Finley developments

19:19.450 --> 19:21.160
would like.

19:21.285 --> 19:24.580
Not quite, it's not worlds

19:21.285 --> 19:24.580
apart, though.

19:24.705 --> 19:28.250
You sure you have no

19:24.705 --> 19:28.250
interest in becoming CEO?

19:29.335 --> 19:32.505
I've thought about it. A lot.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.967
And the answer is no.

19:36.884 --> 19:38.302
Are you sure?

19:38.427 --> 19:41.305
'Cause it sounds like

19:38.427 --> 19:41.305
a life-changing opportunity.

19:44.142 --> 19:45.101
Exactly.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.063
Well, I'll go arrange my

19:47.311 --> 19:49.063
flight home, then.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.399
All right! Forget that.

19:49.188 --> 19:52.399
What are you doing tonight?

19:52.525 --> 19:54.777
-Emails, I imagine.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.777
-No, not anymore.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.905
So Gem's parents are

19:54.902 --> 19:57.905
coming to dinner tonight

19:58.031 --> 19:59.949
and you have to come.

19:58.031 --> 19:59.949
Come on!

20:00.074 --> 20:01.575
If Mrs. B knew you were here

20:01.701 --> 20:03.410
and I didn't invite you to

20:01.701 --> 20:03.410
dinner, she'd never forgive me.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.579
So you do want to take me

20:03.536 --> 20:05.579
to dinner?

20:05.705 --> 20:07.331
No, no, this is strictly

20:05.705 --> 20:07.331
professional.

20:07.456 --> 20:09.167
This is professional.

20:09.291 --> 20:12.753
But hey, if you want to break

20:09.291 --> 20:12.753
Mrs. B's heart, I mean...

20:12.879 --> 20:14.547
So you'd tell on me?

20:14.672 --> 20:17.842
You told Mrs. B that

20:14.672 --> 20:17.842
I broke her kitchen

20:14.672 --> 20:17.842
window back in the day.

20:17.967 --> 20:19.510
You did break her

20:17.967 --> 20:19.510
kitchen window.

20:19.635 --> 20:23.181
-Yeah, but I was gonna fix it.

20:19.635 --> 20:23.181
-With what? You were nine.

20:23.305 --> 20:25.808
I had a whole plan involving

20:23.305 --> 20:25.808
duct tape and cardboard.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.353
It was gonna be great.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.353
It was like a<i> MacGyver</i> thing.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.981
All right. Well, I better

20:29.478 --> 20:31.981
go back to the hotel

20:32.106 --> 20:35.068
and send some emails then if

20:32.106 --> 20:35.068
I'm going to make it to dinner.

20:35.193 --> 20:39.363
-You're gonna come?

20:35.193 --> 20:39.363
-But this contract conversation

20:35.193 --> 20:39.363
is not over, Chip Finley.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.617
Not by a long shot.

20:53.211 --> 20:56.214
OK, I don't think we need

20:53.211 --> 20:56.214
to bore everyone

20:53.211 --> 20:56.214
with all these details.

20:56.338 --> 20:58.591
You should have seen

20:56.338 --> 20:58.591
his face, Mom,

20:58.716 --> 21:00.259
he was shocked when she

20:58.716 --> 21:00.259
beat him at coconut toss.

21:00.384 --> 21:03.096
Oh, Chip, how could you

21:00.384 --> 21:03.096
not recognize Laura?

21:03.221 --> 21:05.056
You two were inseparable

21:03.221 --> 21:05.056
when you were kids!

21:05.181 --> 21:08.726
She's changed a lot since

21:05.181 --> 21:08.726
I last saw her.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.770
-Here she is.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.770
-[gasps]

21:10.895 --> 21:14.941
-Laura!

21:10.895 --> 21:14.941
-Mrs. B! Mr. B! You look great.

21:15.066 --> 21:18.318
-Great to see you, Laura.

21:15.066 --> 21:18.318
-Oh, hello.

21:18.444 --> 21:22.031
My girl, I'm not sure I've ever

21:18.444 --> 21:22.031
seen you with your hair brushed.

21:22.156 --> 21:24.992
That was so long ago.

21:25.118 --> 21:28.662
Theodore, hi,

21:25.118 --> 21:28.662
this is my friend Laura.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.249
The welcome speech was scheduled

21:28.788 --> 21:31.249
to begin five minutes ago.

21:31.373 --> 21:34.668
Right. Of course. I have the

21:31.373 --> 21:34.668
perfect speech all planned out.

21:34.794 --> 21:36.629
Tick tickety tock.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.968
That's my boss. I better

21:38.505 --> 21:41.968
bring you to your table.

21:44.428 --> 21:45.846
Let me know if you need

21:44.428 --> 21:45.846
anything, OK?

21:45.972 --> 21:48.015
Drinks are on me.

21:48.141 --> 21:51.269
-This is the best bit.

21:48.141 --> 21:51.269
-Good evening, everyone.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.938
Welcome to Drift Restaurant.

21:54.063 --> 21:57.108
The sky is putting on quite

21:54.063 --> 21:57.108
the show for us this evening.

21:57.233 --> 21:59.359
Over to the east,

21:57.233 --> 21:59.359
we have the constellation

21:59.485 --> 22:02.446
of the beautiful

21:59.485 --> 22:02.446
maiden Andromeda.

22:02.571 --> 22:04.240
Legend has it

22:02.571 --> 22:04.240
she was rescued

22:04.364 --> 22:08.953
from a sea monster by the brave

22:04.364 --> 22:08.953
warrior Perseus, son of Zeus.

22:09.078 --> 22:11.497
After turning

22:09.078 --> 22:11.497
the monster to stone,

22:11.622 --> 22:14.875
they rode away on his

22:11.622 --> 22:14.875
white-winged horse Pegasus

22:15.001 --> 22:16.460
and lived happily ever after.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.463
And the gods placed

22:16.585 --> 22:19.463
them in the night sky

22:19.588 --> 22:22.967
as a reminder to all of us

22:19.588 --> 22:22.967
to follow our hearts.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.885
Enjoy your dinner.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.637
[applause]

22:28.014 --> 22:29.598
Just beautiful.

22:29.723 --> 22:30.933
Your drinks.

22:31.058 --> 22:32.518
Oh. Thank you.

22:32.643 --> 22:34.561
[Chip] Thanks.

22:34.687 --> 22:40.026
So, Laura, are you here for

22:34.687 --> 22:40.026
Graham's birthday celebrations?

22:40.151 --> 22:41.610
[Chip] Oh, Laura's

22:40.151 --> 22:41.610
a corporate type now,

22:41.735 --> 22:44.947
she's only interested in the

22:41.735 --> 22:44.947
bright lights in the big city.

22:45.072 --> 22:48.951
I can still see that

22:45.072 --> 22:48.951
wild child in there.

22:49.076 --> 22:51.787
Oh, well, Chip is correct.

22:51.912 --> 22:54.248
I do have to head back

22:51.912 --> 22:54.248
to San Francisco right away.

22:54.372 --> 22:58.044
Well, can't we convince

22:54.372 --> 22:58.044
you to stay?

22:54.372 --> 22:58.044
It would be just like old times.

22:58.169 --> 22:59.712
I would love to stay

22:59.837 --> 23:05.051
but this is a work trip and

22:59.837 --> 23:05.051
I need Chip to sign a contract.

23:05.176 --> 23:08.346
-Are we talking about a

23:05.176 --> 23:08.346
Finley Developments contract?

23:05.176 --> 23:08.346
-Mm-hmm.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.974
Well, good luck

23:08.470 --> 23:11.974
trying to get him to sign.

23:12.099 --> 23:15.061
-That is exactly why I'm here.

23:12.099 --> 23:15.061
-[Mr. B] Oh?

23:15.186 --> 23:17.437
But Chip doesn't want to be

23:17.563 --> 23:20.316
the CEO of his grandfather's

23:17.563 --> 23:20.316
billion-dollar business,

23:20.440 --> 23:23.361
so... going to have to

23:20.440 --> 23:23.361
cut my trip short.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.863
Contract and a guilt trip.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.863
Lucky me!

23:25.988 --> 23:29.367
Think of it as a two-for-one

23:25.988 --> 23:29.367
deal just for you.

23:31.160 --> 23:32.536
How's everything?

23:32.661 --> 23:35.789
Oh, just like old times,

23:32.661 --> 23:35.789
Laura is telling on me.

23:35.915 --> 23:39.960
Of course she is.

23:35.915 --> 23:39.960
It's so nice to have you here.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.881
I wish I could join you all

23:40.086 --> 23:43.881
but my boss is

23:40.086 --> 23:43.881
breathing down my neck.

23:44.006 --> 23:46.675
He's already criticizing

23:44.006 --> 23:46.675
my flower arrangements.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.968
Tick tickety tock!

23:49.678 --> 23:52.056
So are we ready to order?

23:52.181 --> 23:53.682
[indistinct chatter]

24:00.022 --> 24:02.900
[phone line rings]

24:03.025 --> 24:04.735
[Owen on phone]

24:03.025 --> 24:04.735
<i>You've reached Owen.</i>

24:03.025 --> 24:04.735
<i>If you want to email me at</i>

24:04.860 --> 24:07.696
<i>owen.fredericks</i>

24:04.860 --> 24:07.696
<i>@gcmandassociates.com,</i>

24:07.821 --> 24:10.448
<i>that would be fantastic.</i>

24:10.574 --> 24:13.493
Hi, honey. Just checking in.

24:10.574 --> 24:13.493
It's late there.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.453
I hope you're not working

24:13.619 --> 24:15.453
too hard.

24:15.579 --> 24:18.791
Anyway, just thinking of you

24:15.579 --> 24:18.791
and I'm missing you.

24:21.043 --> 24:22.628
[phone chimes]

24:22.753 --> 24:25.089
-Owen?

24:22.753 --> 24:25.089
-[Fiona]<i> Laura. How's it going?</i>

24:25.214 --> 24:28.675
Oh, Fiona! Hi. Well, get this.

24:28.801 --> 24:30.803
So apparently Graham's

24:28.801 --> 24:30.803
been trying

24:30.928 --> 24:34.056
to get Chip to sign this

24:30.928 --> 24:34.056
contract for years with no luck

24:34.181 --> 24:37.059
so this might be a little

24:34.181 --> 24:37.059
bit harder than we thought.

24:37.184 --> 24:39.770
Could I extend my trip

24:37.184 --> 24:39.770
by a few days?

24:39.895 --> 24:41.772
Get in the game, Laura.

24:41.897 --> 24:44.733
The partners are thrilled that

24:41.897 --> 24:44.733
Graham has come to us for help

24:44.858 --> 24:47.653
but you know as well as I do

24:44.858 --> 24:47.653
that if this goes well,

24:47.778 --> 24:49.738
he'll bring in

24:47.778 --> 24:49.738
the entire account.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.866
You know, Graham champions

24:49.863 --> 24:52.866
small businesses,

24:52.992 --> 24:55.744
perhaps we could present

24:52.992 --> 24:55.744
my local business plan to him.

24:55.869 --> 24:59.248
Just focus on getting Chip to

24:55.869 --> 24:59.248
sign that contract.

24:59.373 --> 25:00.498
[Laura]<i> Right. Yes.</i>

25:02.001 --> 25:04.753
Maybe there is a different angle

25:02.001 --> 25:04.753
that I can work.

25:04.878 --> 25:07.547
[Fiona]

25:04.878 --> 25:07.547
<i>I really don't care how you</i>

25:04.878 --> 25:07.547
<i>do it, just get it done.</i>

25:07.673 --> 25:12.094
<i>Keep me updated. Good luck.</i>

25:12.219 --> 25:14.347
I'm gonna need

25:12.219 --> 25:14.347
more than just luck.

25:16.307 --> 25:19.517
I'm gonna need

25:16.307 --> 25:19.517
Sapphire Cove Town Hall.

25:21.228 --> 25:22.855
Last night was so nice.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.690
I really don't want

25:22.980 --> 25:24.690
her to go yet.

25:24.815 --> 25:27.525
-She only just got here.

25:24.815 --> 25:27.525
-I'm sorry, Gem.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.945
I'm not signing my life away

25:27.651 --> 25:29.945
just so you can keep her here.

25:30.070 --> 25:32.948
Can't you just pretend

25:30.070 --> 25:32.948
you're interested

25:30.070 --> 25:32.948
so we can catch up properly?

25:33.073 --> 25:34.658
I'm just as happy

25:33.073 --> 25:34.658
to see her as you are.

25:34.783 --> 25:37.495
But she's not here to catch up,

25:34.783 --> 25:37.495
Gem, she's here to work.

25:37.619 --> 25:39.579
So give her some work to do!

25:39.705 --> 25:42.124
She spent all

25:39.705 --> 25:42.124
evening on her phone,

25:42.249 --> 25:44.918
she's probably got plenty

25:42.249 --> 25:44.918
to keep her busy. Give me that.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.671
-I mean work that keeps

25:45.044 --> 25:47.671
her here.

25:45.044 --> 25:47.671
-Huh?

25:48.755 --> 25:50.674
You are not leaving tomorrow.

25:52.259 --> 25:55.304
-Chip.

25:52.259 --> 25:55.304
-Hey.

25:55.429 --> 25:58.391
I've been looking over your

25:55.429 --> 25:58.391
charity's business records.

25:58.516 --> 26:00.934
Where on earth

25:58.516 --> 26:00.934
did you get those?

26:01.060 --> 26:02.686
Do you remember

26:01.060 --> 26:02.686
Penny Michaels?

26:02.811 --> 26:05.772
Braces, pigtails,

26:02.811 --> 26:05.772
allergic to oranges?

26:05.898 --> 26:08.442
Well, guess who works

26:05.898 --> 26:08.442
at Sapphire Cove Town Hall?

26:08.566 --> 26:09.485
That can't be legal.

26:09.609 --> 26:10.777
Look, you have done

26:10.903 --> 26:13.780
an incredible job

26:10.903 --> 26:13.780
with your charity.

26:13.906 --> 26:16.242
But have you considered

26:13.906 --> 26:16.242
what you could do

26:16.367 --> 26:18.702
with the resources

26:16.367 --> 26:18.702
at Finley Developments?

26:18.827 --> 26:20.246
Hmm.

26:20.371 --> 26:22.622
Come on,

26:20.371 --> 26:22.622
you would be unstoppable.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.084
-Unstoppable? Please.

26:22.748 --> 26:25.084
-Yeah.

26:25.209 --> 26:27.627
My father spent years trying

26:25.209 --> 26:27.627
to convince the company

26:27.753 --> 26:29.838
to try something new before

26:27.753 --> 26:29.838
giving up and moving away.

26:29.963 --> 26:33.342
He realized that those suits

26:29.963 --> 26:33.342
are only in it for themselves.

26:33.467 --> 26:37.804
There's probably something in

26:33.467 --> 26:37.804
that contract that makes me

26:33.467 --> 26:37.804
a little more than a puppet.

26:37.930 --> 26:40.307
You haven't even read

26:37.930 --> 26:40.307
the contract.

26:40.433 --> 26:41.683
I have not.

26:41.808 --> 26:44.353
You might be surprised at how

26:41.808 --> 26:44.353
much freedom you would have.

26:44.478 --> 26:46.105
[Chip] I doubt it.

26:50.692 --> 26:54.321
You know what?

26:50.692 --> 26:54.321
No, you're right. I'm sorry.

26:54.447 --> 26:56.740
That would be a crazy amount

26:54.447 --> 26:56.740
of work,

26:56.865 --> 26:59.368
running a company and a charity?

26:59.493 --> 27:03.080
I mean, you're already

26:59.493 --> 27:03.080
busy enough as it is

27:03.205 --> 27:06.333
here with your little tugboat

27:03.205 --> 27:06.333
and playing coconut toss.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.877
All right, hang on a second.

27:09.002 --> 27:11.380
I could run Finley developments

27:09.002 --> 27:11.380
if I wanted to.

27:11.505 --> 27:14.632
I just don't want to. It's true.

27:14.758 --> 27:18.636
In fact, you remember that

27:18.762 --> 27:20.680
seashell jewelry business

27:18.762 --> 27:20.680
I used to have?

27:20.806 --> 27:22.975
Those sold like hot cakes.

27:23.100 --> 27:25.185
I mean, sure, that was

27:23.100 --> 27:25.185
some good pocket money,

27:25.311 --> 27:27.521
but I think you

27:25.311 --> 27:27.521
might find that being CEO is

27:27.645 --> 27:30.690
a little bit more time consuming

27:27.645 --> 27:30.690
than collecting sea shells.

27:30.816 --> 27:33.735
All right, just because

27:30.816 --> 27:33.735
I know how to relax,

27:33.860 --> 27:35.613
doesn't mean I can't work hard.

27:35.737 --> 27:38.282
I'm not a workaholic like you,

27:35.737 --> 27:38.282
but I can throw on a suit

27:38.407 --> 27:41.034
and get things done.

27:38.407 --> 27:41.034
I look great in a suit.

27:42.202 --> 27:43.829
Probably.

27:43.954 --> 27:45.705
I'm not a workaholic.

27:45.831 --> 27:47.333
You've been here less

27:45.831 --> 27:47.333
than 24 hours

27:47.458 --> 27:49.126
and all you've done

27:47.458 --> 27:49.126
is send emails.

27:49.251 --> 27:51.962
In fact, you're the only

27:49.251 --> 27:51.962
person that I know

27:52.087 --> 27:56.091
to ever cut a vacation short to

27:52.087 --> 27:56.091
go back to work.

27:56.216 --> 27:59.803
-That is not true! I have fun.

27:56.216 --> 27:59.803
-Really?

27:59.928 --> 28:01.679
-Yeah.

27:59.928 --> 28:01.679
-Like what?

28:01.805 --> 28:05.518
-Like I read books.

28:01.805 --> 28:05.518
-Ooh! Books!

28:05.643 --> 28:06.644
What kind of books?

28:06.768 --> 28:09.480
Like, books about justice

28:09.605 --> 28:12.358
and great battles

28:09.605 --> 28:12.358
between right and wrong.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.818
Do you mean law books?

28:14.943 --> 28:17.404
-Yes.

28:14.943 --> 28:17.404
-That's what I'm talking about.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.906
[chuckles triumphantly]

28:20.032 --> 28:23.243
Law books! You know what?

28:20.032 --> 28:23.243
I'll read that contract

28:23.369 --> 28:25.371
the minute you remember

28:23.369 --> 28:25.371
how to have fun.

28:28.541 --> 28:29.707
Is that a deal?

28:31.043 --> 28:33.504
What?

28:33.629 --> 28:37.799
I'll relax. Sure. I'll lie

28:33.629 --> 28:37.799
by the pool. I'll get a tan.

28:37.924 --> 28:41.845
I'll even leave my phone alone.

28:37.924 --> 28:41.845
You read that contract.

28:41.970 --> 28:44.723
-Yeah, OK, I was just...

28:41.970 --> 28:44.723
-Come on!

28:44.848 --> 28:47.893
[exclaims] One page.

28:48.602 --> 28:50.187
Excuse me?

28:50.312 --> 28:54.900
I will read one page for

28:50.312 --> 28:54.900
every fun thing that you do.

28:55.025 --> 28:57.194
OK? You know what?

28:57.319 --> 29:01.615
I'm not just talking about

28:57.319 --> 29:01.615
like, regular like,

28:57.319 --> 29:01.615
lying-by-the-pool fun.

29:01.740 --> 29:03.033
I'm talking

29:01.740 --> 29:03.033
about real activities

29:03.158 --> 29:07.371
like hiking and snorkeling

29:03.158 --> 29:07.371
and horseback riding.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.956
-I am not horseback riding.

29:07.496 --> 29:09.956
-Oh, you're not?

29:10.082 --> 29:11.667
Oh, well,

29:10.082 --> 29:11.667
that is a deal breaker.

29:11.791 --> 29:12.918
We tried. Gem, we tried.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.294
Don't tell me I didn't try.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.714
Laura, this is perfect.

29:14.420 --> 29:16.714
Come on.

29:19.717 --> 29:20.593
OK!

29:22.052 --> 29:23.095
What's that?

29:25.097 --> 29:29.476
OK, I will ride a horse.

29:29.602 --> 29:31.895
But I will not sign

29:29.602 --> 29:31.895
a liability waiver.

29:32.020 --> 29:32.979
You got a deal.

29:42.531 --> 29:44.157
[woman on phone]

29:42.531 --> 29:44.157
<i>Mm-hm. What's next?</i>

29:44.283 --> 29:46.493
We are going to keep

29:44.283 --> 29:46.493
article 3.1

29:46.619 --> 29:50.456
and we'll replace articles 4.7

29:46.619 --> 29:50.456
and 12.2, thank you.

29:50.581 --> 29:53.083
And could you send through

29:50.581 --> 29:53.083
my updated itinerary?

29:53.208 --> 29:54.710
-[woman]<i> Sure.</i>

29:53.208 --> 29:54.710
-[knock at door]

29:54.834 --> 29:56.587
Hold on. Come in.

30:00.674 --> 30:02.134
Ready?

30:02.259 --> 30:04.094
Now is not a great time.

30:04.219 --> 30:06.472
Oh. Here I was thinking you

30:04.219 --> 30:06.472
wanted me to read that contract.

30:06.597 --> 30:10.225
But if it's not a great time

30:06.597 --> 30:10.225
then I guess...

30:12.645 --> 30:16.565
Did I say "not a great time"?

30:12.645 --> 30:16.565
I meant now is the perfect time.

30:16.690 --> 30:18.191
[Chip] Oh, sounds perfect.

30:18.317 --> 30:21.069
[chuckles]

30:21.194 --> 30:24.323
I'm sorry, Kelly. I'm gonna

30:21.194 --> 30:24.323
have to cut this short.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.659
[Chip] All right,

30:24.448 --> 30:26.659
let's go snorkeling.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.414
Are you sure this is safe?

30:32.539 --> 30:35.709
I don't think my travel

30:32.539 --> 30:35.709
insurance covers snorkeling.

30:35.834 --> 30:39.171
Seriously? What's happened

30:35.834 --> 30:39.171
to you? It's perfectly safe.

30:39.296 --> 30:40.673
We used to do this all the time.

30:40.798 --> 30:41.840
When we were 12.

30:41.965 --> 30:44.551
I don't go in the ocean very

30:41.965 --> 30:44.551
much anymore, Chip.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.512
There's no waves.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.512
There's no sharks.

30:46.637 --> 30:49.055
It's not jellyfish season

30:46.637 --> 30:49.055
and the pirates called

30:49.181 --> 30:53.352
to say they're having a barbecue

30:49.181 --> 30:53.352
today so you're safe. Come on.

30:57.523 --> 30:58.607
For the contract.

31:00.442 --> 31:06.824
<i>♪ She takes me back</i>

31:42.025 --> 31:46.196
That was incredible!

31:42.025 --> 31:46.196
That coral reef is so beautiful.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.407
Did you see all those

31:46.321 --> 31:48.407
tropical fish?

31:48.532 --> 31:51.702
[sighs] I never get to do

31:48.532 --> 31:51.702
stuff like this.

31:51.827 --> 31:54.996
That's what we call that

31:51.827 --> 31:54.996
island magic, remember?

31:55.121 --> 31:57.416
You don't get to snorkel

31:55.121 --> 31:57.416
in San Francisco?

31:57.541 --> 32:00.836
Not without catching

31:57.541 --> 32:00.836
hypothermia.

32:07.384 --> 32:09.469
I've missed this island.

32:09.595 --> 32:10.888
It missed you.

32:17.977 --> 32:19.229
Strawberry?

32:19.979 --> 32:21.356
Thanks.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.156
You're gonna read

32:27.946 --> 32:30.156
that contract now?

32:30.282 --> 32:31.324
Uh-huh.

32:31.450 --> 32:34.369
Oh, well, you might

32:31.450 --> 32:34.369
want to wipe your hands.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.079
Oh.

32:37.539 --> 32:39.666
[chuckles] Really?

32:41.960 --> 32:46.172
I read, you relax.

32:41.960 --> 32:46.172
That's the deal.

32:47.925 --> 32:50.427
Got it. Relaxing.

33:04.524 --> 33:05.943
[Chip] See, this is what I'm

33:04.524 --> 33:05.943
talking about.

33:06.067 --> 33:07.861
Some of these suits

33:06.067 --> 33:07.861
have spent so long in the office

33:07.986 --> 33:09.655
they've forgotten what

33:07.986 --> 33:09.655
it's like in a work site.

33:09.780 --> 33:12.616
We need more engineers

33:09.780 --> 33:12.616
in the boardroom.

33:12.741 --> 33:15.118
We need more engineers?

33:15.243 --> 33:17.078
Are you gonna sign it?

33:17.203 --> 33:19.414
No. No.

33:17.203 --> 33:19.414
I mean, "they," obviously.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.417
I'm just doing this for Laura.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.417
We need to humor her.

33:22.542 --> 33:25.671
Uh-huh. So what's your

33:22.542 --> 33:25.671
plan for tomorrow?

33:25.796 --> 33:27.881
I need to think of more

33:25.796 --> 33:27.881
activities to do.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.549
Do you think she'd

33:28.006 --> 33:29.549
enjoy fishing?

33:29.675 --> 33:31.343
She used to like fishing, right?

33:31.468 --> 33:34.471
Sure. Lawyers are known

33:31.468 --> 33:34.471
for their fishing skills.

33:35.472 --> 33:36.890
Or hiking?

33:37.015 --> 33:39.559
Maybe you're going above

33:37.015 --> 33:39.559
and beyond

33:39.685 --> 33:41.603
to keep a certain

33:39.685 --> 33:41.603
someone interested.

33:41.728 --> 33:45.273
Ha-ha, funny. No, Gem,

33:41.728 --> 33:45.273
it's not that.

33:45.398 --> 33:47.860
She is doing her part

33:45.398 --> 33:47.860
so I am doing mine. That's all.

33:47.985 --> 33:50.320
It was you that told me

33:47.985 --> 33:50.320
to keep her here.

33:50.445 --> 33:52.113
-I'm doing this for you!

33:50.445 --> 33:52.113
-OK.

33:52.238 --> 33:55.868
And, you know, this is for

33:52.238 --> 33:55.868
old time's sake. That's all.

33:55.993 --> 33:58.537
Sure. For old time's sake.

34:03.542 --> 34:05.878
[Laura] We never get weather

34:03.542 --> 34:05.878
like this in San Francisco.

34:06.003 --> 34:07.880
-I know. It's so nice.

34:08.005 --> 34:13.218
Ooh! I just got the itinerary

34:08.005 --> 34:13.218
through. And it's official.

34:13.343 --> 34:15.136
I will be here

34:13.343 --> 34:15.136
for Graham's birthday.

34:15.261 --> 34:19.683
Oh! Please never leave.

34:15.261 --> 34:19.683
We have to get you a dress.

34:19.808 --> 34:23.812
Yeah, I mean, how are the plans

34:19.808 --> 34:23.812
for the birthday celebration

34:19.808 --> 34:23.812
coming along?

34:23.937 --> 34:26.565
I'm getting there.

34:23.937 --> 34:26.565
But there's still a lot to do.

34:26.690 --> 34:29.651
I just want everything

34:26.690 --> 34:29.651
to be perfect for Graham.

34:29.776 --> 34:31.820
Although, I am more

34:29.776 --> 34:31.820
worried about Theodore.

34:31.945 --> 34:34.656
He's impossible to please.

34:34.781 --> 34:38.577
-Hmm.

34:34.781 --> 34:38.577
-Hey, hey! I got a blast

34:34.781 --> 34:38.577
from the past for you.

34:38.702 --> 34:40.662
Wow! Where did you

34:38.702 --> 34:40.662
find that thing?

34:40.787 --> 34:44.290
The old shed! And I picked

34:40.787 --> 34:44.290
out the perfect fishing spot.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.334
I hope you have

34:44.416 --> 34:46.334
your lucky charm

34:46.459 --> 34:48.837
because you're gonna

34:46.459 --> 34:48.837
need it to catch a fish.

34:48.962 --> 34:51.464
-Lucky charm?

34:48.962 --> 34:51.464
-Oh, nothing. Let's go.

You're the worst.

35:11.777 --> 35:15.072
You got somewhere better to be?

35:15.196 --> 35:17.490
Well, I don't have high

35:15.196 --> 35:17.490

35:17.616 --> 35:19.826
Well, at least you're

35:17.616 --> 35:19.826
off your phone.

35:20.702 --> 35:22.495
[phone chimes]

35:22.621 --> 35:25.040
Thank you.

35:31.379 --> 35:34.382
So is this your standard

35:31.379 --> 35:34.382
Monday morning?

35:36.301 --> 35:38.219
Yeah, kinda, I guess.

35:38.344 --> 35:40.680
Why, this isn't part of your

35:38.344 --> 35:40.680
regular routine?

35:40.806 --> 35:43.182
I would be on my third

35:48.730 --> 35:51.441
Do you love it?

35:48.730 --> 35:51.441
Being a lawyer?

35:51.566 --> 35:53.819
Yeah. I do.

35:53.944 --> 35:56.195
Although, I wish I could

35:53.944 --> 35:56.195
help people more.

35:56.321 --> 35:58.782
I want to be able

35:56.321 --> 35:58.782
to pick my own clients

35:58.907 --> 36:00.366
and choose the cases I take on.

36:00.492 --> 36:04.704
What cases would you choose

36:00.492 --> 36:04.704
if it were up to you?

36:04.830 --> 36:10.043
-Well, don't laugh.

-Scout's honor.

who need extra support

36:12.045 --> 36:15.966
but they can't always afford it.

36:16.091 --> 36:19.344
Sounds kinda hard in

36:16.091 --> 36:19.344
a big commercial law firm.

36:19.469 --> 36:22.514
Yeah, it isn't easy which

36:19.469 --> 36:22.514
is why I'm working so hard

36:22.639 --> 36:26.392
to become partner so that

36:22.639 --> 36:26.392
I can call all of the shots.

36:26.518 --> 36:29.021
Well, some of them at least.

36:29.146 --> 36:33.232
That's the Laura I know.

36:29.146 --> 36:33.232
Ambitious. I like it.

36:37.821 --> 36:42.325
Wow. You're right. This is

36:37.821 --> 36:42.325
really spectacular.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.661
Oh, come on.

36:44.786 --> 36:49.248
I'm sure you and Owen have

36:44.786 --> 36:49.248
plenty of spectacular moments.

36:49.374 --> 36:53.503
Yeah, I mean, we don't

No, we have a serious

37:02.762 --> 37:06.808
and make financial plans,

what's best for me,

until we find the landowner's

40:48.487 --> 40:50.823
relatives,

40:50.949 --> 40:53.952
which is impossible

40:50.949 --> 40:53.952
so there's still a few families

40:54.077 --> 40:55.703
on the island who desperately

40:54.077 --> 40:55.703
need homes.

40:55.828 --> 40:58.831
So I was hoping

40:55.828 --> 40:58.831
to get that land for them.

40:59.665 --> 41:02.168
I love that.

41:02.294 --> 41:03.628
I hope you understand

41:02.294 --> 41:03.628
I have obligations here

41:03.753 --> 41:05.504
that I can't abandon

41:03.753 --> 41:05.504
for some big company

41:05.630 --> 41:07.090
who doesn't care

41:05.630 --> 41:07.090
about the little guy.

41:08.674 --> 41:13.221
You're not your grandfather,

41:08.674 --> 41:13.221
Chip. You're you!

41:13.346 --> 41:14.973
This would be Chip's company

41:15.098 --> 41:18.643
with a different way

41:15.098 --> 41:18.643
of doing things.

41:18.768 --> 41:21.771
-I don't know.

41:18.768 --> 41:21.771
-Things can change.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.356
Just like that.

41:23.481 --> 41:26.109
Hey, come on. Yo, no! No fair.

41:26.234 --> 41:27.819
-[Laura] Come on!

41:26.234 --> 41:27.819
-[Chip] Ya! Come on!

41:27.944 --> 41:29.654
-[Laura] Let's go! Let's go!

41:27.944 --> 41:29.654
-[Chip] Come on!

41:29.779 --> 41:31.990
[Chip] Come on... [indistinct]

41:29.779 --> 41:31.990
Let's catch her!

41:33.992 --> 41:36.577
-[Laura] Catch up, Zeus.

41:33.992 --> 41:36.577
-[Chip] I'm trying.

41:36.702 --> 41:38.163
[Chip] Giddap. Come on!

41:38.288 --> 41:41.540
-[Chip] Giddap. Come on, boy.

41:38.288 --> 41:41.540
-[Laura] Come on, come on!

41:42.708 --> 41:44.294
[Laura] Whoa!

41:44.419 --> 41:47.422
[Chip] Whoa, boy! Whoa.

41:50.800 --> 41:53.928
I am so happy

41:50.800 --> 41:53.928
that we did this.

41:54.053 --> 41:56.389
It almost looked like

41:54.053 --> 41:56.389
you were having fun.

41:56.514 --> 41:58.557
Maybe a little.

41:58.683 --> 42:00.977
Sure you don't have

41:58.683 --> 42:00.977
time for adventures?

42:02.103 --> 42:06.399
OK, you got me. Thank you.

42:07.066 --> 42:08.734
Anytime.

42:10.028 --> 42:14.240
[thunder rumbles]

42:15.867 --> 42:17.243
Come on.

42:19.329 --> 42:22.499
[thunder rumbles]

42:25.377 --> 42:29.130
[phone chimes]

42:33.801 --> 42:35.970
[Owen]<i> Yeah, sure, Michael.</i>

42:33.801 --> 42:35.970
<i>review the wording.</i>

42:36.095 --> 42:38.473
<i>Honey, hi.</i>

42:36.095 --> 42:38.473
<i>Oh, did I wake you?</i>

42:38.597 --> 42:41.934
Yeah, it's midnight here.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.686
Everything OK?

42:43.811 --> 42:45.522
My client has

42:43.811 --> 42:45.522
a paper trail a mile long,

42:45.646 --> 42:48.441
<i>I was trying to get</i>

42:45.646 --> 42:48.441
<i>on top of it.</i>

42:45.646 --> 42:48.441
<i>How's everything with you?</i>

42:48.607 --> 42:49.608
How's Emerald Rocks?

42:49.734 --> 42:53.154
[scoffs] Sapphire Cove.

42:53.279 --> 42:56.324
Actually, I had

42:53.279 --> 42:56.324
a really great day.

42:56.449 --> 43:00.412
Hey, you know what we should do

42:56.449 --> 43:00.412
when we go on our honeymoon?

43:00.537 --> 43:04.123
-What's that?

43:00.537 --> 43:04.123
-We should go horseback riding.

43:04.249 --> 43:05.958
Ha! That's hilarious.

43:09.128 --> 43:12.382
<i>-Oh, you're serious!</i>

43:09.128 --> 43:12.382
-It's just a thought.

43:12.507 --> 43:14.300
Honey, no, no,

43:12.507 --> 43:14.300
I'm not into that.

43:14.426 --> 43:17.262
-You know that.

43:14.426 --> 43:17.262
-Why not?

43:17.387 --> 43:21.266
It's fun and adventurous.

43:21.391 --> 43:24.602
How about you go horse riding

43:21.391 --> 43:24.602
and I'll take the pictures.

43:24.727 --> 43:28.189
Yeah, it was just a thought.

43:24.727 --> 43:28.189
[thunder rumbles]

43:28.314 --> 43:31.150
[Owen]

43:28.314 --> 43:31.150
<i>Hey, about the wedding...</i>

43:31.276 --> 43:34.320
How do you feel about

43:31.276 --> 43:34.320
pushing the date back again?

43:34.446 --> 43:39.451
Again? Owen,

43:34.446 --> 43:39.451
this is the third time.

43:39.576 --> 43:41.160
I know.

43:41.286 --> 43:43.829
But the board has invited me

43:41.286 --> 43:43.829
to a retreat that weekend

43:43.955 --> 43:47.750
and you know how important those

43:43.955 --> 43:47.750
retreats are for networking.

43:47.875 --> 43:50.169
I just... [scoffs]

43:50.295 --> 43:53.256
Laura, I just need you to hold

43:50.295 --> 43:53.256
on a little bit longer, OK?

43:53.381 --> 43:55.592
We'll set a date

43:53.381 --> 43:55.592
as soon as you get back.

43:58.886 --> 44:01.347
[sighs] I don't know.

44:01.473 --> 44:07.728
Owen, I...

44:01.473 --> 44:07.728
I think I need a break.

44:07.853 --> 44:11.816
<i>Just being back here,</i>

44:07.853 --> 44:11.816
<i>it's given me some time</i>

44:11.941 --> 44:13.192
to think.

44:13.318 --> 44:18.406
About us. Our future.

44:13.318 --> 44:18.406
About what I want.

44:20.199 --> 44:22.076
<i>I think I need some time</i>

44:20.199 --> 44:22.076
<i>to work things out.</i>

44:22.201 --> 44:24.703
-[door opens]

44:22.201 --> 44:24.703
-[man] Hey, meeting's in five.

44:24.829 --> 44:26.289
Uh... understood.

44:26.414 --> 44:28.040
[man]

44:26.414 --> 44:28.040
Everyone's in the boardroom.

44:28.166 --> 44:30.751
Look, play it the way you want.

44:30.876 --> 44:32.545
Work the scenarios

44:30.876 --> 44:32.545
through for you

44:32.670 --> 44:35.840
and let me know where

44:32.670 --> 44:35.840
you stand on it all, OK?

44:38.843 --> 44:39.969
OK.

44:41.220 --> 44:46.017
[thunder rumbles in distance]

44:47.602 --> 44:49.479
[phone ringing]

44:53.399 --> 44:57.111
[rain falls]

45:08.039 --> 45:10.124
Thanks, I'll get the broom.

45:12.502 --> 45:15.921
-Hey, get any sleep last night?

45:12.502 --> 45:15.921
-Not really.

45:16.047 --> 45:19.008
Wild storm.

45:16.047 --> 45:19.008
Is everything OK down here?

45:19.133 --> 45:21.344
Just tidying up.

45:19.133 --> 45:21.344
Some big branches came down.

45:21.469 --> 45:23.888
There's been a little damage

45:21.469 --> 45:23.888
to Mom and Dad's place.

45:24.013 --> 45:25.598
Oh, my gosh! Are they OK?

45:25.722 --> 45:29.686
Oh, yeah, just waiting on

45:25.722 --> 45:29.686
a status report from Chip.

45:29.810 --> 45:31.062
-Speaking of...

45:29.810 --> 45:31.062
-[Chip] Hey.

45:31.187 --> 45:34.440
-How's the house?

45:31.187 --> 45:34.440
-Nothing too serious.

45:34.566 --> 45:36.859
A drainpipe got pretty beat up.

45:34.566 --> 45:36.859
A few other things.

45:36.984 --> 45:38.403
-But it will be OK.

45:36.984 --> 45:38.403
-OK.

45:38.528 --> 45:40.737
-Morning, Laura.

45:38.528 --> 45:40.737
-Morning.

45:40.863 --> 45:42.240
I'm glad everything's OK.

45:42.365 --> 45:43.740
If Mom happens to be baking,

45:43.866 --> 45:45.951
can you bring me back

45:43.866 --> 45:45.951
some banana bread?

45:46.077 --> 45:48.663
-Banana bread. Got it.

45:46.077 --> 45:48.663
-Please? Thank you.

45:48.787 --> 45:50.540
Oh, let me help you with that.

45:50.665 --> 45:53.834
Um, I'm gonna grab my tools

45:50.665 --> 45:53.834
and get started.

45:53.959 --> 45:55.961
[Gem] James, can you

45:53.959 --> 45:55.961
get the ladder?

45:56.087 --> 45:58.381
Sounds like a lot of work.

45:58.506 --> 46:01.008
Yeah. That looks

45:58.506 --> 46:01.008
like a lot of work.

46:02.801 --> 46:05.804
It's nothing that can't wait.

46:02.801 --> 46:05.804
I can help.

46:05.930 --> 46:07.890
All right, then.

46:08.015 --> 46:12.853
But no fun, all right? I'm

46:08.015 --> 46:12.853
done reading for a little bit.

46:12.978 --> 46:15.648
No fun. Promise.

46:17.108 --> 46:19.444
[scoffs] OK.

46:27.118 --> 46:29.036
Thank you.

46:29.161 --> 46:34.250
Oh, and if you could just

46:29.161 --> 46:34.250
give me a ham... Hammer.

46:34.375 --> 46:36.294
You always were one step ahead.

46:39.046 --> 46:41.340
Why don't you two

46:39.046 --> 46:41.340
take a break?

46:41.466 --> 46:43.884
Thank you.

46:44.009 --> 46:45.553
It's very good of you

46:44.009 --> 46:45.553
both to do this.

46:45.678 --> 46:46.971
It's my pleasure, Mrs. B.

46:47.096 --> 46:49.181
Besides, we got most

46:47.096 --> 46:49.181
of the materials

46:47.096 --> 46:49.181
leftover from the build.

46:49.307 --> 46:51.142
You're a good man.

46:51.267 --> 46:52.809
Well, come inside when

46:51.267 --> 46:52.809
you're ready for lunch.

46:52.935 --> 46:54.395
Thank you.

46:55.688 --> 46:57.523
So you built this house?

46:58.441 --> 47:00.735
I guess I did.

47:00.859 --> 47:03.446
Mr. And Mrs. B had

47:00.859 --> 47:03.446
a little financial trouble

47:03.571 --> 47:04.905
after he hurt his back

47:05.030 --> 47:07.158
and, well, they've

47:05.030 --> 47:07.158
done so much for me

47:07.283 --> 47:08.493
that it was

47:07.283 --> 47:08.493
the least I could do.

47:08.618 --> 47:11.203
Besides, it proved

47:08.618 --> 47:11.203
to be a good prototype

47:11.329 --> 47:12.747
for the next few builds.

47:13.665 --> 47:15.040
Wow.

47:18.919 --> 47:21.756
Do you like it?

47:21.880 --> 47:25.343
Chip, this is my dream house.

47:25.468 --> 47:27.804
You wait till you see inside.

47:27.928 --> 47:30.348
-You've built four of these?

47:27.928 --> 47:30.348
-That's right.

47:30.473 --> 47:31.974
I mean, I would've built more

47:32.099 --> 47:34.477
except it's hard

47:32.099 --> 47:34.477
to gather the funds.

47:36.354 --> 47:39.231
-Come on.

47:36.354 --> 47:39.231
-What's so funny?

47:39.357 --> 47:41.359
You talk about

47:39.357 --> 47:41.359
building up funds

47:41.484 --> 47:43.986
like you don't have

47:41.484 --> 47:43.986
a billion-dollar company

47:44.111 --> 47:45.988
waiting for your signature.

47:46.113 --> 47:47.864
OK, I know this is

47:46.113 --> 47:47.864
simplifying things

47:47.990 --> 47:50.242
but look at what you've built.

47:50.368 --> 47:52.537
There is no reason

47:50.368 --> 47:52.537
that the charity

47:52.662 --> 47:54.413
couldn't be integrated

47:52.662 --> 47:54.413
into the company.

47:54.539 --> 47:55.748
You could do both.

47:58.083 --> 47:59.627
I don't think anyone's

47:58.083 --> 47:59.627
ever tried

47:59.752 --> 48:03.005
so hard to convince me

47:59.752 --> 48:03.005
of something before.

48:03.130 --> 48:06.091
You must really think

48:03.130 --> 48:06.091
anything is possible.

48:06.217 --> 48:08.219
Anything is possible.

48:13.725 --> 48:15.976
[sighs]

48:16.101 --> 48:19.104
This is beautiful.

48:19.230 --> 48:21.440
I always thought they'd end

48:19.230 --> 48:21.440
up together.

48:21.566 --> 48:23.401
Everyone did.

48:23.526 --> 48:26.487
He was never the same

48:23.526 --> 48:26.487
after she left.

48:26.612 --> 48:29.532
[clears throat] And this is

48:26.612 --> 48:29.532
the living room and kitchen.

48:29.657 --> 48:32.034
[Laura] Oh, wow, your home

48:29.657 --> 48:32.034
is just gorgeous.

48:32.159 --> 48:33.536
Thank you.

48:33.661 --> 48:36.455
Oh, and Gem

48:33.661 --> 48:36.455
requested some banana bread.

48:36.581 --> 48:38.666
Oh, well, are

48:36.581 --> 48:38.666
we ready for lunch?

48:38.791 --> 48:40.459
-Yup.

48:38.791 --> 48:40.459
-Yes. Please.

48:42.961 --> 48:44.756
[Mrs. B] Thanks, Laura.

48:44.881 --> 48:47.592
That deed to our old house has

48:44.881 --> 48:47.592
been giving me grief forever.

48:47.717 --> 48:48.634
Oh, it's no trouble at all.

48:48.760 --> 48:50.887
These things can be

48:48.760 --> 48:50.887
a nightmare to deal with.

48:51.011 --> 48:52.929
Yeah, not to mention having to

48:51.011 --> 48:52.929
travel to the mainland

48:53.055 --> 48:54.265
for this kind of thing.

48:54.390 --> 48:56.601
It's such a bother

48:54.390 --> 48:56.601
and expensive.

48:56.726 --> 48:59.936
You mean there's no law

48:56.726 --> 48:59.936
firm in Sapphire Cove?

49:00.062 --> 49:02.231
No, not since

49:00.062 --> 49:02.231
Mr. Martin retired.

49:02.356 --> 49:03.524
Oh.

49:03.649 --> 49:05.693
Okay, I think we're

49:03.649 --> 49:05.693
nearly done out here,

49:05.818 --> 49:07.779
just have to attach that support

49:05.818 --> 49:07.779
beam to the retaining wall.

49:07.904 --> 49:11.323
-Right?

49:07.904 --> 49:11.323
-Retaining well? Really?

49:11.449 --> 49:13.701
What? He offered!

49:13.826 --> 49:17.037
Yeah. It's really not a problem.

49:13.826 --> 49:17.037
It'll only take a minute.

49:17.162 --> 49:18.748
I can help. Ow!

49:18.873 --> 49:22.209
-Oh, hey, you all right?

49:18.873 --> 49:22.209
-Yeah, just a splinter.

49:23.795 --> 49:26.004
Oh, yeah, that, oof,

49:23.795 --> 49:26.004
that is a doozy.

49:26.130 --> 49:27.882
You mind if we finish tomorrow?

49:28.006 --> 49:30.468
I should probably take her

49:28.006 --> 49:30.468
to the hotel, first-aid kit.

49:30.593 --> 49:32.470
You should get that removed

49:30.593 --> 49:32.470
for sure.

49:32.595 --> 49:34.096
You're onto something, I think.

49:32.595 --> 49:34.096
Let's go.

49:34.221 --> 49:35.347
Very funny.

49:35.473 --> 49:36.766
I just had your safety

49:35.473 --> 49:36.766
in mind, that's all.

49:36.891 --> 49:38.142
-Oh, thank you.

49:36.891 --> 49:38.142
-Careful now.

49:38.267 --> 49:40.812
-Not feeling faint, are you?

49:38.267 --> 49:40.812
-I think I'll survive.

49:40.937 --> 49:43.272
Okay, let me get that for you.

49:40.937 --> 49:43.272
Can't be careful.

49:43.397 --> 49:45.900
-Why, thank you.

49:43.397 --> 49:45.900
-Mm-hmm.

49:46.859 --> 49:48.026
Ow!

49:48.152 --> 49:50.696
-Oh! Oh, right, are you sure?

49:48.152 --> 49:50.696
-Oh, come on!

49:50.822 --> 49:53.115
You're gonna make it worse.

49:50.822 --> 49:53.115
Gonna have to amputate.

49:54.116 --> 49:56.160
-Thank you.

49:54.116 --> 49:56.160
-You OK?

49:56.285 --> 49:57.870
I'm OK.

50:00.456 --> 50:02.667
-Chip.

50:00.456 --> 50:02.667
-Yeah?

50:02.792 --> 50:05.169
Banana bread.

50:05.294 --> 50:07.379
Save some for Gem or

50:05.294 --> 50:07.379
she'll never forgive me.

50:07.505 --> 50:08.965
Thank you Mrs. B.

50:09.089 --> 50:11.091
-Thank you.

50:09.089 --> 50:11.091
-Hey!

50:11.216 --> 50:12.885
See you soon.

50:13.009 --> 50:14.971
Get out here. Come on!

50:20.476 --> 50:22.687
Got it. I think I...

50:20.476 --> 50:22.687
Almost.

50:22.812 --> 50:24.104
OK. Here we go.

50:24.229 --> 50:26.858
I would usually do this myself,

50:24.229 --> 50:26.858
it's just...

50:26.983 --> 50:29.109
it's my right

50:26.983 --> 50:29.109
hand and I'm right-handed.

50:29.234 --> 50:31.403
It's OK. Stay still.

50:31.529 --> 50:34.281
-Ow.

50:31.529 --> 50:34.281
-Got it. You all right?

50:34.406 --> 50:36.575
You know, I think this is

50:34.406 --> 50:36.575
the first time

50:36.701 --> 50:38.786
that I've seen

50:36.701 --> 50:38.786
you without your phone.

50:38.911 --> 50:42.748
Ha. Yeah, it's kinda nice

50:38.911 --> 50:42.748
not being tied to the office

50:38.911 --> 50:42.748
for once.

50:42.874 --> 50:44.082
Not bad.

50:49.171 --> 50:52.842
Hey, do you... Do you

50:49.171 --> 50:52.842
remember when we were kids

50:52.967 --> 50:57.346
and we buried that treasure

50:52.967 --> 50:57.346
chest with my necklace in it?

50:57.471 --> 51:00.432
I spent three months'

50:57.471 --> 51:00.432
allowance on that necklace.

51:00.558 --> 51:02.560
Hey, you remember

51:00.558 --> 51:02.560
we made that map

51:02.685 --> 51:04.854
so we wouldn't forget

51:02.685 --> 51:04.854
where we put it too?

51:05.688 --> 51:08.566
Did you ever...

51:08.691 --> 51:13.111
I don't know,

51:08.691 --> 51:13.111
think about digging it up?

51:14.697 --> 51:19.201
I, uh, almost did.

51:19.326 --> 51:24.456
I was gonna dig it up,

51:19.326 --> 51:24.456
get that necklace and...

51:24.582 --> 51:27.125
come find you

51:24.582 --> 51:27.125
in San Francisco.

51:28.335 --> 51:29.921
Really?

51:30.796 --> 51:32.548
Yeah.

51:34.967 --> 51:39.430
But then I thought,

51:34.967 --> 51:39.430
"She's probably got someone

51:39.555 --> 51:40.973
who cares for her very much

51:41.097 --> 51:42.600
and has got her a nicer,

51:41.097 --> 51:42.600
better necklace

51:42.725 --> 51:45.436
and she will have

51:42.725 --> 51:45.436
forgotten all about me

51:45.561 --> 51:50.148
and my silly fishing

51:45.561 --> 51:50.148
rods and treasure maps."

51:53.986 --> 51:55.279
Chip...

51:57.031 --> 51:58.824
-Yeah?

51:57.031 --> 51:58.824
-[Owen] Laura.

52:00.158 --> 52:02.870
-Owen?

52:00.158 --> 52:02.870
-Surprise.

52:02.995 --> 52:05.121
What are you doing here?

52:05.247 --> 52:08.333
-Oh!

52:05.247 --> 52:08.333
-Oh. I missed you!

52:08.459 --> 52:11.837
After we talked, I realized

52:08.459 --> 52:11.837
I had to come out here

52:11.963 --> 52:13.965
and apologize in person.

52:14.090 --> 52:17.802
I've been so focused on work

52:14.090 --> 52:17.802
that I've started to lose

52:14.090 --> 52:17.802
sight of what's important.

52:17.927 --> 52:19.470
I don't want to lose you.

52:19.595 --> 52:23.139
Oh, and I got some case notes

52:19.595 --> 52:23.139
I'd love you to take a look at.

52:23.265 --> 52:26.226
-Who's this?

52:23.265 --> 52:26.226
-Owen, this is Chip.

52:26.351 --> 52:27.812
-Chip Finley.

52:26.351 --> 52:27.812
-Hey.

52:27.937 --> 52:29.647
Oh, congratulations.

52:29.772 --> 52:31.983
-Oh.

52:29.772 --> 52:31.983
-CEO of Finley Developments.

52:32.108 --> 52:34.192
-Do you have representation?

52:32.108 --> 52:34.192
-Uh...

52:34.318 --> 52:36.528
My firm's known for helping

52:34.318 --> 52:36.528
out big players, that's all.

52:36.654 --> 52:39.949
-I haven't signed it yet...

52:36.654 --> 52:39.949
-We haven't really worked

52:36.654 --> 52:39.949
out any of the details

52:40.074 --> 52:41.325
of the contract so...

52:41.450 --> 52:42.827
I'm just kidding.

52:42.952 --> 52:44.620
Of course you're gonna go

52:42.952 --> 52:44.620
with Laura's firm.

52:44.745 --> 52:45.746
OK.

52:45.871 --> 52:48.164
-It is nice to meet you, Owen.

52:45.871 --> 52:48.164
-Likewise.

52:48.290 --> 52:51.836
And I should probably

52:48.290 --> 52:51.836
get this back to reception.

52:51.961 --> 52:54.338
We should have dinner.

52:51.961 --> 52:54.338
Chip, you're free tonight!

52:54.463 --> 52:58.092
-[Laura] Oh, no, we don't...

52:54.463 --> 52:58.092
-No, I insist.

52:58.216 --> 53:01.679
Dinner. Great. I will see

52:58.216 --> 53:01.679
if Gem can make it too.

53:01.804 --> 53:03.681
That would be... great.

53:03.806 --> 53:04.682
OK.

53:06.224 --> 53:09.687
My little shark.

53:06.224 --> 53:09.687
In her natural habitat.

53:30.206 --> 53:32.208
Mom and Dad are really

53:30.206 --> 53:32.208
lucky to have you guys.

53:32.334 --> 53:33.711
Thank you for

53:32.334 --> 53:33.711
helping them today.

53:33.836 --> 53:37.173
That's OK. And Laura, she was

53:33.836 --> 53:37.173
a real pro with getting

53:37.297 --> 53:39.591
that broken drainpipe repaired.

53:39.717 --> 53:42.136
-You helped repair a drainpipe?

53:39.717 --> 53:42.136
-She sure did.

53:42.260 --> 53:44.138
She's not even the worst

53:42.260 --> 53:44.138
apprentice I've ever had.

53:44.262 --> 53:46.057
Oh, apprentice, is it?

53:46.182 --> 53:49.601
I feel like I at least deserve

53:46.182 --> 53:49.601
a promotion to supervisor or...

53:49.727 --> 53:52.604
Do you? No, I mean,

53:49.727 --> 53:52.604
and, look, if you hadn't

53:49.727 --> 53:52.604
eaten the banana bread,

53:52.730 --> 53:55.024
-then maybe you could have.

53:52.730 --> 53:55.024
-I knew there was banana bread!

53:55.149 --> 53:57.275
I don't believe you just

53:55.149 --> 53:57.275
told on me.

53:57.401 --> 53:58.861
-What?

53:57.401 --> 53:58.861
-[Laura] Gem, I am sorry.

53:58.986 --> 54:01.572
I was injured.

53:58.986 --> 54:01.572
I needed the sugar.

54:01.697 --> 54:03.407
[Chip] That's not even

54:01.697 --> 54:03.407
the right finger!

54:06.077 --> 54:08.162
Anyway, Laura,

54:06.077 --> 54:08.162
she was a real trooper.

54:08.286 --> 54:13.458
You're a lucky man, Owen.

54:13.584 --> 54:16.045
I should have married her

54:13.584 --> 54:16.045
the moment I saw her.

54:16.170 --> 54:18.214
Which is why

54:16.170 --> 54:18.214
I've made a decision.

54:18.338 --> 54:19.882
Laura, I want you to marry me.

54:20.007 --> 54:22.467
Yeah, we've done

54:20.007 --> 54:22.467
this bit, remember?

54:22.593 --> 54:23.802
At the Law Society Ball?

54:23.928 --> 54:25.930
No, I want to get married here.

54:26.055 --> 54:28.015
Now. In Emerald Rocks.

54:28.140 --> 54:30.601
-[both] It's Sapphire Cove.

54:28.140 --> 54:30.601
-Whatever.

54:30.726 --> 54:33.269
I can talk to management.

54:30.726 --> 54:33.269
I'm sure they can organize

54:30.726 --> 54:33.269
something in a day or two.

54:33.395 --> 54:35.773
Nothing outrageous.

54:33.395 --> 54:35.773
Small but classy.

54:35.898 --> 54:37.357
Family and friends won't be here

54:37.482 --> 54:39.275
but we can have a party when

54:37.482 --> 54:39.275
we get back to San Francisco.

54:39.401 --> 54:40.986
Yeah, Owen,

54:39.401 --> 54:40.986
I just don't think...

54:41.112 --> 54:42.988
Chip could walk

54:41.112 --> 54:42.988
you down the aisle.

54:43.114 --> 54:44.280
-[Chip] Hmm?

54:43.114 --> 54:44.280
-Yeah, what do you say, Chip?

54:44.406 --> 54:46.742
-Hmm? Oh...

54:44.406 --> 54:46.742
-How spontaneous.

54:46.867 --> 54:48.619
-More drinks.

54:46.867 --> 54:48.619
-[waiter] Right away.

54:48.744 --> 54:52.164
I don't think that Chip

54:48.744 --> 54:52.164
would be really want to...

54:52.288 --> 54:53.958
Who are we fooling?

54:54.083 --> 54:57.461
You know, I was in my office

54:54.083 --> 54:57.461
the other night after we had

54:54.083 --> 54:57.461
our talk

54:57.586 --> 55:00.214
and I suddenly thought,

54:57.586 --> 55:00.214
"Laura has been with me

55:00.338 --> 55:03.050
through some of the toughest

55:00.338 --> 55:03.050
cases I've ever had.

55:03.175 --> 55:06.511
She's smart, she's gorgeous.

55:03.175 --> 55:06.511
She's one heck of a lawyer.

55:06.637 --> 55:07.930
She's a keeper."

55:10.849 --> 55:13.393
You must really

55:10.849 --> 55:13.393
like the island, Owen.

55:13.518 --> 55:15.104
I mean, you've only been here

55:13.518 --> 55:15.104
a few hours,

55:15.229 --> 55:18.482
but your first impressions

55:15.229 --> 55:18.482
must be... impressed.

55:18.607 --> 55:21.735
Absolutely. I don't think

55:18.607 --> 55:21.735
I could live here, though.

55:21.860 --> 55:24.196
[Chip] Island life wouldn't

55:21.860 --> 55:24.196
work for you?

55:24.320 --> 55:27.783
-Feels a little small for me.

55:24.320 --> 55:27.783
-Oh.

55:27.908 --> 55:29.534
But hey, different strokes

55:27.908 --> 55:29.534
for different folks.

55:29.660 --> 55:31.369
-[phone chimes]

55:29.660 --> 55:31.369
-Oh!

55:31.495 --> 55:33.747
Excuse me. I gotta get this.

55:33.872 --> 55:37.001
Yeah, this place is nice.

55:33.872 --> 55:37.001
We should do it here.

55:37.126 --> 55:41.672
Hit me. Yeah...

55:37.126 --> 55:41.672
Hey. Listen, slow down.

55:41.797 --> 55:42.923
He seems nice.

55:43.048 --> 55:45.050
[Chip] Oh, yeah,

55:43.048 --> 55:45.050
he seems very nice, Laura.

55:45.176 --> 55:47.719
I mean, you know, not for me,

55:45.176 --> 55:47.719
but like he says,

55:47.845 --> 55:49.680
different strokes

55:47.845 --> 55:49.680
for different folks.

55:49.805 --> 55:51.974
He's not usually like this.

55:52.099 --> 55:54.643
-I think he's Jet lagged or...

55:52.099 --> 55:54.643
-Jet lagged, yeah.

55:54.768 --> 55:56.436
You know, I did realize

55:54.768 --> 55:56.436
something, though.

55:56.561 --> 55:57.938
He can't handle life

55:56.561 --> 55:57.938
on a small island

55:58.063 --> 56:00.398
and I can cannot be

55:58.063 --> 56:00.398
a corporate big shot.

56:00.524 --> 56:04.820
Might be OK for some people.

56:00.524 --> 56:04.820
But that life will never be me.

56:04.945 --> 56:08.991
I mean, there's nothing wrong

56:04.945 --> 56:08.991
with wanting to push yourself.

56:09.116 --> 56:10.575
I do push myself, Laura.

56:10.701 --> 56:15.247
I'm just not gonna be pushed

56:10.701 --> 56:15.247
into being a suit like that.

56:15.371 --> 56:17.249
But I'm sure you guys

56:15.371 --> 56:17.249
will be very happy.

56:21.128 --> 56:22.171
Wow.

56:28.927 --> 56:31.889
I'm going to leave now.

56:33.389 --> 56:34.474
Good night.

56:37.353 --> 56:40.522
Well, do you want to talk

56:37.353 --> 56:40.522
about what just happened?

56:44.400 --> 56:45.736
No.

56:45.861 --> 56:47.946
What? This is madness.

56:48.072 --> 56:51.325
How were we supposed to know

56:48.072 --> 56:51.325
he had a bank account

56:48.072 --> 56:51.325
in the Cayman Islands?

56:51.449 --> 56:54.328
-Yeah, I agree we need a

56:51.449 --> 56:54.328
realistic approach.

56:51.449 --> 56:54.328
-Thanks.

56:54.452 --> 56:56.747
Let's unpack it

56:54.452 --> 56:56.747
when I get back.

56:58.582 --> 57:01.626
One day! I'm gone one day

56:58.582 --> 57:01.626
and the whole thing falls apart.

57:01.752 --> 57:04.880
I tell ya... [sighs]

57:05.005 --> 57:07.591
What's wrong, honey?

57:05.005 --> 57:07.591
What's going on?

57:07.716 --> 57:09.093
I thought you'd be

57:07.716 --> 57:09.093
happy to see me.

57:22.398 --> 57:27.236
-Granddad?

57:22.398 --> 57:27.236
-Oh, Chip. Listen to this.

57:27.361 --> 57:30.239
I was not expecting

57:27.361 --> 57:30.239
you back yet.

57:30.364 --> 57:33.658
It's a letter you

57:30.364 --> 57:33.658
and Laura wrote

57:33.784 --> 57:37.162
apologizing for stealing

57:33.784 --> 57:37.162
banana bread.

57:37.288 --> 57:39.497
"Dear Mrs. Bailey...

57:39.623 --> 57:41.708
We regret the theft occurred

57:41.833 --> 57:43.877
and wish to apologize

57:41.833 --> 57:43.877
wholeheartedly

57:44.002 --> 57:46.546
on behalf of our evil twins.

57:46.671 --> 57:48.506
We really hope that

57:46.671 --> 57:48.506
we are still allowed

57:48.632 --> 57:52.136
to hang out with

57:48.632 --> 57:52.136
our best friend Gem.

57:52.261 --> 57:55.597
We promise to mow your lawn

57:52.261 --> 57:55.597
for the entire summer.

57:55.722 --> 57:59.810
Sincerely, evil twins,

57:55.722 --> 57:59.810
Chip and Laura."

57:59.935 --> 58:02.479
It's not really

57:59.935 --> 58:02.479
a good time right now.

58:05.190 --> 58:07.359
What are you doing here?

58:07.484 --> 58:10.195
I flew in early for the

58:07.484 --> 58:10.195
birthday celebrations.

58:10.321 --> 58:14.074
-And I thought I just...

58:10.321 --> 58:14.074
-Hide from all your friends?

58:14.199 --> 58:15.742
Something like that.

58:19.579 --> 58:21.373
I see you've been fishing.

58:21.498 --> 58:24.418
Those rods must be

58:21.498 --> 58:24.418
a million years old.

58:24.542 --> 58:27.171
I took Laura out.

58:27.296 --> 58:29.756
Oh, yes, and how

58:27.296 --> 58:29.756
did it go there?

58:29.881 --> 58:32.259
Granddad, could you just

58:29.881 --> 58:32.259
stop with the contract?

58:32.384 --> 58:35.304
I know it's your birthday soon

58:32.384 --> 58:35.304
and I know you want me to sign,

58:35.429 --> 58:37.014
but I'm sorry, I'm not your guy.

58:37.139 --> 58:39.599
Well, now you've

58:37.139 --> 58:39.599
brought it up,

58:39.724 --> 58:44.313
I've said it before and I'll say

58:39.724 --> 58:44.313
it again, you are the right man.

58:44.438 --> 58:46.857
We went through this with Dad.

58:44.438 --> 58:46.857
Remember how that turned out?

58:46.982 --> 58:49.401
You are not your father.

58:49.526 --> 58:51.153
And things were

58:49.526 --> 58:51.153
very different then.

58:51.278 --> 58:55.907
It's a completely different

58:51.278 --> 58:55.907
company now.

58:56.033 --> 58:59.411
A company you can be

58:56.033 --> 58:59.411
proud to run.

59:00.537 --> 59:03.707
This company is your future.

59:06.126 --> 59:07.461
What's happened, Chip?

59:09.087 --> 59:11.215
People change.

59:11.340 --> 59:13.175
Things change.

59:13.300 --> 59:14.968
And Laura?

59:15.093 --> 59:20.182
I wondered whether the two

59:15.093 --> 59:20.182
of you had hit it off again.

59:20.307 --> 59:24.019
You two were always

59:20.307 --> 59:24.019
so happy together.

59:24.144 --> 59:27.898
Well, it's not like that now.

59:28.023 --> 59:29.941
I mean, we...

59:31.735 --> 59:33.153
She has a fiancé.

59:33.278 --> 59:35.447
Who literally just arrived here

59:35.572 --> 59:40.118
and he wants to marry her

59:35.572 --> 59:40.118
on the island tomorrow.

59:40.244 --> 59:44.373
-And did she invite him here?

59:40.244 --> 59:44.373
-No. He surprised her.

59:44.498 --> 59:46.417
Did he?

59:46.542 --> 59:49.461
Well, things change.

59:52.214 --> 59:54.216
I gotta go.

59:55.217 --> 59:58.136
Things change.

59:58.262 --> 1:00:02.724
I want my husband to be

59:58.262 --> 1:00:02.724
my best friend.

1:00:04.476 --> 1:00:08.688
Someone that I can have

1:00:04.476 --> 1:00:08.688
adventures with.

1:00:08.813 --> 1:00:15.404
I feel like our careers have

1:00:08.813 --> 1:00:15.404
taken priority over everything.

1:00:16.154 --> 1:00:18.323
Over us.

1:00:18.449 --> 1:00:21.452
It's all we ever talk about.

1:00:22.786 --> 1:00:27.749
Take away the work and...

1:00:22.786 --> 1:00:27.749
what's left?

1:00:27.874 --> 1:00:31.628
Well, I can change.

1:00:27.874 --> 1:00:31.628
I can work less.

1:00:34.047 --> 1:00:37.468
It's not about you, Owen.

1:00:34.047 --> 1:00:37.468
It's me.

1:00:38.885 --> 1:00:41.597
I'd stopped being myself.

1:00:43.807 --> 1:00:49.438
I guess it took me being back

1:00:43.807 --> 1:00:49.438
here to realize who I truly am.

1:00:53.191 --> 1:00:54.776
I'm sorry.

1:01:08.582 --> 1:01:12.461
[Karavi] It'll be alright,

1:01:08.582 --> 1:01:12.461
buddy. I promise.

1:01:12.586 --> 1:01:15.213
Karavi, can you check that

1:01:12.586 --> 1:01:15.213
the linen has arrived, please?

1:01:15.339 --> 1:01:18.967
And that the kitchen got the

1:01:15.339 --> 1:01:18.967
vegetable and the herb order?

1:01:19.092 --> 1:01:22.304
-It's almost time to open.

1:01:19.092 --> 1:01:22.304
-You got it, boss.

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:29.019
Is there, like,

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:29.019
a dessert-related emergency

1:01:25.765 --> 1:01:29.019
that I haven't heard of?

1:01:29.144 --> 1:01:30.854
I'm just checking options

1:01:29.144 --> 1:01:30.854
for Graham's party.

1:01:30.979 --> 1:01:34.774
-He likes chocolate, right?

1:01:30.979 --> 1:01:34.774
-Uh... Does he like chocolate?

1:01:34.899 --> 1:01:37.402
-Try this.

1:01:34.899 --> 1:01:37.402
-Mmm...

1:01:37.528 --> 1:01:39.196
Are you still reading that?

1:01:39.321 --> 1:01:42.449
Figured out how to get

1:01:39.321 --> 1:01:42.449
the engineers into

1:01:39.321 --> 1:01:42.449
the board meetings yet?

1:01:42.574 --> 1:01:43.908
Yeah, I'm not signing it.

1:01:46.828 --> 1:01:48.246
-[Owen] Chip.

1:01:46.828 --> 1:01:48.246
-Mmm.

1:01:48.372 --> 1:01:51.208
I'm glad I caught

1:01:48.372 --> 1:01:51.208
you before I left.

1:01:51.333 --> 1:01:52.917
Left? Heading out so soon?

1:01:53.043 --> 1:01:56.588
I thought you and Laura would

1:01:53.043 --> 1:01:56.588
be planning your big day?

1:01:56.713 --> 1:01:58.840
Laura and I have decided to

1:01:56.713 --> 1:01:58.840
take a break.

1:01:58.965 --> 1:02:01.176
An indefinite break.

1:02:01.301 --> 1:02:04.221
-Oh.

1:02:01.301 --> 1:02:04.221
-I'm so sorry to hear that.

1:02:04.346 --> 1:02:07.432
Yeah, Laura's a great girl.

1:02:04.346 --> 1:02:07.432
And she deserves to be happy.

1:02:07.558 --> 1:02:11.019
And to be honest, she seemed

1:02:07.558 --> 1:02:11.019
pretty happy last night

1:02:11.144 --> 1:02:15.357
talking about banana bread

1:02:11.144 --> 1:02:15.357
and fixing a drainpipe with you.

1:02:15.482 --> 1:02:17.817
I don't think I've ever

1:02:15.482 --> 1:02:17.817
seen her that happy.

1:02:20.862 --> 1:02:24.074
Anyway, take care, Chip.

1:02:25.242 --> 1:02:27.661
You too.

1:02:27.785 --> 1:02:29.705
[knock at door]

1:02:30.539 --> 1:02:32.290
Come in.

1:02:36.294 --> 1:02:40.048
I heard what happened.

1:02:36.294 --> 1:02:40.048
How are you?

1:02:42.133 --> 1:02:44.969
May I suggest an action plan?

1:02:45.970 --> 1:02:49.474
One, we eat these cakes.

1:02:49.600 --> 1:02:51.602
Two, we go to the spa

1:02:51.727 --> 1:02:53.811
and take advantage

1:02:51.727 --> 1:02:53.811
of my staff discount.

1:02:53.937 --> 1:02:56.732
Three, just breathe.

1:03:00.444 --> 1:03:04.114
[breathes deeply]

1:03:12.581 --> 1:03:15.709
I feel like I could

1:03:12.581 --> 1:03:15.709
just float away.

1:03:18.836 --> 1:03:22.173
That was the best massage

1:03:18.836 --> 1:03:22.173
I've ever had.

1:03:33.184 --> 1:03:34.311
[sighs]

1:03:41.359 --> 1:03:43.612
This is exactly what I needed.

1:03:43.737 --> 1:03:47.157
-Thanks, Gem.

1:03:43.737 --> 1:03:47.157
-You're welcome.

1:03:47.282 --> 1:03:50.994
Well, I cannot believe

1:03:47.282 --> 1:03:50.994
Graham's birthday celebrations

1:03:47.282 --> 1:03:50.994
are tomorrow.

1:03:51.119 --> 1:03:53.789
I think I have everything

1:03:51.119 --> 1:03:53.789
under control.

1:03:56.166 --> 1:03:57.542
Graham's birthday

1:03:57.668 --> 1:04:00.712
and the deadline to

1:03:57.668 --> 1:04:00.712
get the contract signed.

1:04:00.837 --> 1:04:02.547
What will you guys do?

1:04:06.217 --> 1:04:07.511
I truly don't know.

1:04:07.636 --> 1:04:10.305
He seems so stuck.

1:04:10.430 --> 1:04:14.934
I just wish I could

1:04:10.430 --> 1:04:14.934
make this decision about the

1:04:10.430 --> 1:04:14.934
contract easier for him.

1:04:15.059 --> 1:04:18.522
He'll never

1:04:15.059 --> 1:04:18.522
leave the island.

1:04:18.647 --> 1:04:20.691
If only there was a way

1:04:18.647 --> 1:04:20.691
he could do both.

1:04:24.736 --> 1:04:27.238
That's it.

1:04:27.364 --> 1:04:31.326
I mean, we couldn't do it

1:04:27.364 --> 1:04:31.326
all at once but we could do it.

1:04:31.451 --> 1:04:33.328
Gem, that's brilliant!

1:04:35.121 --> 1:04:37.040
Always happy to help.

1:04:41.670 --> 1:04:45.006
[taps keys]

1:04:46.466 --> 1:04:48.552
[object clatters]

1:04:55.517 --> 1:04:57.769
[object clatters]

1:05:03.441 --> 1:05:05.235
Laura? You awake?

1:05:07.028 --> 1:05:09.531
Chip, what are you

1:05:07.028 --> 1:05:09.531
doing down there?

1:05:09.656 --> 1:05:16.162
I, um, wasn't sure that

1:05:09.656 --> 1:05:16.162
you'd want to speak to me.

1:05:16.287 --> 1:05:20.417
Would you want to come

1:05:16.287 --> 1:05:20.417
on a sunrise hike with me?

1:05:26.214 --> 1:05:28.383
That sounds like an adventure.

1:05:30.385 --> 1:05:32.970
It is an adventure.

1:05:33.096 --> 1:05:35.766
I'll be right down.

1:05:46.401 --> 1:05:51.698
Hey, um, Laura, I'm really

1:05:46.401 --> 1:05:51.698
sorry about the other night.

1:05:51.823 --> 1:05:54.534
What you've done with your

1:05:51.823 --> 1:05:54.534
career, what you've become,

1:05:54.659 --> 1:05:56.119
it's really impressive.

1:05:56.244 --> 1:06:01.499
Sometimes I... I wish

1:05:56.244 --> 1:06:01.499
I was more like that.

1:06:01.625 --> 1:06:04.544
Anyway, I'm sorry.

1:06:05.378 --> 1:06:06.963
It's OK.

1:06:08.673 --> 1:06:12.928
I'm kind of realizing

1:06:08.673 --> 1:06:12.928
that work isn't everything.

1:06:13.052 --> 1:06:16.097
I guess being back

1:06:13.052 --> 1:06:16.097
on the island gave me

1:06:16.222 --> 1:06:18.892
a different perspective

1:06:16.222 --> 1:06:18.892
on things.

1:06:20.226 --> 1:06:23.146
I kind of feel like

1:06:20.226 --> 1:06:23.146
I'm home again.

1:06:23.271 --> 1:06:27.233
Something about this place,

1:06:23.271 --> 1:06:27.233
I guess, just...

1:06:27.358 --> 1:06:31.237
This island just

1:06:27.358 --> 1:06:31.237
helps people see clearly.

1:06:33.949 --> 1:06:39.329
-Must be that island magic.

1:06:33.949 --> 1:06:39.329
-Must be.

1:06:39.454 --> 1:06:42.958
[Laura]

1:06:39.454 --> 1:06:42.958
Home isn't a place.

1:06:39.454 --> 1:06:42.958
It's a feeling.

1:06:43.082 --> 1:06:46.085
And, you know,

1:06:43.082 --> 1:06:46.085
I'm starting to realize

1:06:46.210 --> 1:06:50.173
what you've been saying about

1:06:46.210 --> 1:06:50.173
not wanting to leave this place.

1:06:53.050 --> 1:06:55.470
So I've had an idea.

1:06:55.595 --> 1:06:58.097
Oh, more reading. Great!

1:06:58.222 --> 1:07:01.685
Yes, but I've added in

1:06:58.222 --> 1:07:01.685
a new condition.

1:07:01.810 --> 1:07:04.729
If you accept the role as CEO,

1:07:04.855 --> 1:07:08.107
company headquarters will

1:07:04.855 --> 1:07:08.107
be moved to the island.
