<b><i>He's so far away...</i></b>

00:05.410 --> 00:08.780
<b><i>But he's not out of reach.</i></b>

00:11.050 --> 00:12.970
<b><i>I need more training in Nen...</i></b>

00:13.430 --> 00:16.240
<b><i>To find a power that's as strong as Hisoka's!</i></b>

01:51.540 --> 01:53.090
<b>Mito-san!</b>

01:54.740 --> 01:56.090
<b>Mito-san!</b>

01:58.330 --> 02:00.160
<b>Mito-san!</b>

02:04.080 --> 02:05.180
<b>Gon...</b>

02:06.350 --> 02:07.780
<b>Gon!</b>

02:10.080 --> 02:11.330
<b>Mito-san!</b>

02:13.370 --> 02:15.110
<b>I'm home, Mito-san.</b>

02:15.510 --> 02:17.130
<b>Welcome home, Gon.</b>

02:22.530 --> 02:24.370
<b>You must be Killua, right?</b>

02:27.120 --> 02:32.130
<b>Ging x And x Gon</b>

02:33.970 --> 02:34.630
<b>Sheesh,</b>

02:35.350 --> 02:38.630
<b>you should have let me know 
you were coming home.</b>

02:38.630 --> 02:41.140
<b>I didn't have time to prepare anything.</b>

02:41.650 --> 02:43.640
<b>It's not a big deal, whatever is fine.</b>

02:43.640 --> 02:45.400
<b>What are you saying?</b>

02:45.400 --> 02:48.030
<b>Your friend came all the 
way out here to visit.</b>

02:48.030 --> 02:50.140
<b>No, it's okay.</b>

02:50.630 --> 02:55.040
<b>Honestly, you should have 
said something first...</b>

02:57.020 --> 02:58.200
<b>Are you listening to me?</b>

03:00.860 --> 03:01.910
<b>Oh, that's right...</b>

03:02.320 --> 03:05.050
<b>Take a bath while I make 
something to eat.</b>

03:05.050 --> 03:07.140
<b>And put out your dirty clothes.</b>

03:07.140 --> 03:08.260
<b>I'll be doing laundry.</b>

03:08.260 --> 03:09.440
<b>Okay, later.</b>

03:09.440 --> 03:10.160
<b>Now!</b>

03:10.160 --> 03:11.670
<b>You have ten seconds!</b>

03:11.670 --> 03:12.760
<b>One.</b>

03:12.760 --> 03:13.830
<b>Two.</b>

03:13.830 --> 03:14.880
<b>Three.</b>

03:14.460 --> 03:15.870
<b>Is she always like this?</b>

03:14.880 --> 03:16.080
<b>Four.</b>

03:16.080 --> 03:17.060
<b>Five.</b>

03:16.350 --> 03:17.430
<b>Pretty much.</b>

03:17.060 --> 03:18.160
<b>Six.</b>

03:17.430 --> 03:19.150
<b>Let's move fast!</b>

03:18.160 --> 03:19.160
<b>Seven.</b>

03:19.160 --> 03:19.920
<b>Eight.</b>

03:19.920 --> 03:20.720
<b>Nine.</b>

03:23.670 --> 03:26.970
<b>Yeah, this is the life...</b>

03:29.560 --> 03:31.680
<b>Okay, let's eat.</b>

03:31.680 --> 03:33.100
<b>Wow!</b>

03:33.100 --> 03:34.690
<b>This looks delicious.</b>

03:46.100 --> 03:47.370
<b>What are you doing?</b>

03:48.130 --> 03:50.370
<b>Offering our thanks.</b>

03:50.370 --> 03:51.830
<b>What does that mean?</b>

03:51.830 --> 03:52.370
<b>All right...</b>

03:52.370 --> 03:54.110
<b>Let's dig in.</b>

03:54.110 --> 03:56.400
<b>Please help yourself, Killua.</b>

03:56.400 --> 03:57.250
<b>Right.</b>

04:11.620 --> 04:13.050
<b>Oh, right, Mito-san.</b>

04:14.450 --> 04:15.020
<b>Look!</b>

04:15.020 --> 04:17.300
<b>This is a Hunter License.</b>

04:19.680 --> 04:20.900
<b>Hmm...</b>

04:20.900 --> 04:22.750
<b>It looks pretty normal.</b>

04:24.520 --> 04:25.070
<b>There.</b>

04:26.140 --> 04:28.620
<b>Hey, what are you doing?</b>

04:28.990 --> 04:30.260
<b>Just kidding...</b>

04:30.260 --> 04:32.040
<b>I would never do anything like that.</b>

04:32.040 --> 04:35.280
<b>Man, what if it doesn't work anymore?</b>

04:40.690 --> 04:44.310
<b>Mito-san, I'm going to show 
Killua around the island.</b>

04:45.640 --> 04:47.390
<b>Won't that take a while?</b>

04:47.390 --> 04:49.180
<b>Want me to pack some food for you?</b>

04:49.720 --> 04:51.000
<b>That's okay!</b>

04:51.000 --> 04:53.430
<b>We'll find something to eat in the forest.</b>

05:44.330 --> 05:47.150
<b>Gon and his friend are rather late.</b>

05:47.400 --> 05:49.990
<b>It's been a while since he 
was last on this island.</b>

05:50.710 --> 05:53.530
<b>And he's brought his first friend along.</b>

05:55.680 --> 05:58.660
<b>I'm sure they won't be back until it's late.</b>

05:58.960 --> 06:00.860
<b>You're right...</b>

06:04.540 --> 06:07.680
<b><i>Maybe I should take some 
food out to them.</i></b>

06:18.280 --> 06:19.310
<b>Hey, Gon.</b>

06:21.290 --> 06:24.310
<b>What are you going to do now?</b>

06:28.550 --> 06:31.710
<b>For now, I'll rest up here</b>

06:31.710 --> 06:34.100
<b>while I gather information...</b>

06:34.100 --> 06:37.410
<b>The information I'll need before I go  
to Yorknew to look for my dad.</b>

06:39.260 --> 06:40.380
<b>Oh...</b>

06:42.820 --> 06:44.930
<b>What should I do?</b>

06:44.930 --> 06:45.660
<b>Huh?</b>

06:46.430 --> 06:49.770
<b>You should stay here and then 
go to Yorknew with me!</b>

06:49.770 --> 06:52.530
<b>Yeah, I'm coming with you.</b>

06:52.530 --> 06:54.510
<b>That wasn't what I meant.</b>

06:55.700 --> 06:57.860
<b>I was thinking you're sort of admirable.</b>

06:59.970 --> 07:01.970
<b>There's nothing I really want to do...</b>

07:02.530 --> 07:05.900
<b>I don't really have anything 
I want to do like you do.</b>

07:12.160 --> 07:15.600
<b>Though there are plenty of 
things I don't want to do.</b>

07:16.140 --> 07:17.410
<b>I don't want to stay in that house...</b>

07:17.970 --> 07:19.780
<b>Or inherit the family business.</b>

07:22.660 --> 07:25.540
<b>I guess I'm a little jealous.</b>

07:27.490 --> 07:28.800
<b>Killua...</b>

07:30.340 --> 07:33.430
<b>I think it's fun to be with you.</b>

07:34.860 --> 07:37.060
<b>Wh-What's that about?</b>

07:37.560 --> 07:39.430
<b>Whale Island</b>

07:39.430 --> 07:43.450
<b>is a place for fishermen to stay 
during extended outings.</b>

07:43.840 --> 07:46.640
<b>There aren't too many native residents.</b>

07:47.530 --> 07:51.710
<b>There's one other kid here that's 
around my age, and she's a girl.</b>

07:51.710 --> 07:55.820
<b>So you're my first friend who's the same age.</b>

07:58.190 --> 08:00.200
<b>My situation was similar...</b>

08:00.200 --> 08:02.370
<b>Stuck in that house all day.</b>

08:02.820 --> 08:05.830
<b>I spent all my time learning how to kill.</b>

08:06.580 --> 08:08.470
<b>You were my first friend.</b>

08:08.470 --> 08:11.150
<b>Do you have fun when we're together?</b>

08:13.280 --> 08:15.340
<b>I guess, yeah.</b>

08:15.880 --> 08:18.140
<b>Then let's stick together!</b>

08:18.970 --> 08:23.410
<b>We can travel around and 
see the world together!</b>

08:24.000 --> 08:27.300
<b>Don't you ever feel embarrassed 
saying that stuff?</b>

08:33.800 --> 08:35.480
<b>I'll be looking for my dad.</b>

08:37.890 --> 08:41.140
<b>You'll be looking for what you want to do.</b>

08:46.440 --> 08:48.110
<b>It'll be a blast!</b>

08:50.710 --> 08:51.840
<b>Yeah.</b>

08:53.010 --> 08:54.690
<b>Doesn't sound too bad.</b>

08:56.240 --> 08:57.500
<b>Okay!</b>

08:57.500 --> 09:01.970
<b>I'll help you look for your dad until 
I discover what I want to do!</b>

09:01.970 --> 09:02.830
<b>Okay!</b>

09:05.660 --> 09:08.900
<b>Oh, what's your mom doing?</b>

09:18.250 --> 09:22.790
<b>It's hard asking about my dad, 
but asking about my mom is even harder.</b>

09:23.930 --> 09:27.300
<b>Since Mito-san raised me by herself,</b>

09:27.300 --> 09:30.780
<b>it would feel wrong to ask her that...</b>

09:31.410 --> 09:32.920
<b>Is that how it works?</b>

09:33.910 --> 09:36.650
<b>At first, Mito-san told me</b>

09:36.650 --> 09:39.430
<b>my parents died in a traffic accident.</b>

09:40.550 --> 09:43.870
<b>She was worried that I 
might end up like my dad</b>

09:43.870 --> 09:47.020
<b>if I learned he was alive and a Hunter...</b>

09:48.250 --> 09:50.940
<b>And she was right.</b>

09:52.260 --> 09:54.260
<b>When I found out about my dad,</b>

09:54.260 --> 10:00.490
<b>I kind of figured that my 
mom was probably dead.</b>

10:01.170 --> 10:03.620
<b>That's pretty harsh!</b>

10:05.590 --> 10:09.310
<b>So I've always thought of Mito-san as my mom.</b>

10:10.690 --> 10:12.520
<b>She's the only mom I have.</b>

10:12.940 --> 10:14.950
<b>So there's nothing for me to ask.</b>

10:14.950 --> 10:16.510
<b>I don't need to.</b>

10:17.610 --> 10:18.730
<b>I see.</b>

10:21.010 --> 10:22.590
<b>Man,</b>

10:22.590 --> 10:25.780
<b>I wish I had a mom like Mito-san...</b>

10:25.780 --> 10:27.140
<b>She's the best!</b>

10:27.140 --> 10:28.980
<b>Though she does nag a lot.</b>

10:29.570 --> 10:31.080
<b>That's nothing...</b>

10:31.080 --> 10:35.720
<b>My mom starts crying the second 
I say I want to go outside!</b>

10:35.720 --> 10:37.610
<b>She actually goes into hysterics!</b>

10:59.860 --> 11:00.730
<b>Say...</b>

11:00.730 --> 11:01.760
<b>What?</b>

11:01.760 --> 11:04.060
<b>How long will you be staying?</b>

11:10.300 --> 11:12.440
<b>Maybe a month?</b>

11:17.750 --> 11:19.450
<b>After that...</b>

11:21.260 --> 11:23.700
<b>I'm going to look for my dad.</b>

11:36.560 --> 11:37.700
<b>What's this?</b>

11:37.700 --> 11:39.500
<b>Something Ging left with me.</b>

11:39.500 --> 11:40.410
<b>Huh?</b>

11:40.410 --> 11:44.100
<b>He asked me to give this to you 
when you became a Hunter.</b>

11:45.700 --> 11:48.070
<b>My dad left this for me...</b>

11:48.070 --> 11:49.220
<b>I'll tell you</b>

11:50.420 --> 11:53.230
<b>everything I know about Ging.</b>

11:59.780 --> 12:02.580
<b>Ging is my cousin.</b>

12:02.580 --> 12:05.960
<b>My oldest memory of him is of his back.</b>

12:06.790 --> 12:09.670
<b>I was always running after him.</b>

12:11.010 --> 12:13.170
<b>I think back then, I was three...</b>

12:14.140 --> 12:18.470
<b>I have the feeling that I was 
always looking at his back.</b>

12:19.870 --> 12:24.400
<b>At age twelve, Ging left the 
island to take the Hunter Exam,</b>

12:24.400 --> 12:26.230
<b>just like you did.</b>

12:28.920 --> 12:31.770
<b>He suddenly said that 
he was leaving the island.</b>

12:32.110 --> 12:35.270
<b>When I asked him why, he told me this...</b>

12:37.350 --> 12:39.400
<b>"There's something that I want."</b>

12:41.550 --> 12:45.950
<b>He never told me what it 
was that he wanted.</b>

12:45.950 --> 12:47.590
<b>We argued...</b>

12:47.590 --> 12:51.160
<b>Actually, it was just me making a fuss.</b>

12:51.600 --> 12:55.550
<b>But I never got to see Ging again 
before he left the island.</b>

12:56.880 --> 12:59.170
<b>You were originally told</b>

12:59.170 --> 13:02.670
<b>that your parents died in a 
traffic accident, right?</b>

13:02.670 --> 13:06.180
<b>That was what happened to Mito's parents.</b>

13:07.740 --> 13:11.420
<b>It happened right after Ging left the island.</b>

13:12.450 --> 13:13.620
<b>After that,</b>

13:13.620 --> 13:18.310
<b>Ging's father went missing on a fishing trip.</b>

13:19.840 --> 13:24.570
<b>Both of my sons ended up passing away.</b>

13:26.190 --> 13:27.320
<b><i>Yes...</i></b>

13:27.770 --> 13:30.690
<b><i>All that happened after he left.</i></b>

13:32.700 --> 13:37.080
<b>Ten years later, Ging returned to the island.</b>

13:37.590 --> 13:40.220
<b>When he returned, he came carrying you,</b>

13:40.220 --> 13:42.090
<b>and you were still a baby.</b>

13:43.040 --> 13:45.670
<b>He just popped up, out of nowhere.</b>

13:45.670 --> 13:49.260
<b>And he asked us to take care of you.</b>

13:49.260 --> 13:53.630
<b>When I asked about your mother, 
he'd only say that they were separated.</b>

13:55.130 --> 14:00.060
<b>I was about to agree to look after you, 
when I heard a loud,</b>

14:00.060 --> 14:02.650
<b>"Don't be silly!"</b>

14:02.650 --> 14:05.200
<b>I imagine everyone on the island heard it.</b>

14:05.200 --> 14:07.280
<b>Grandma, you don't need to mention that!</b>

14:07.850 --> 14:12.700
<b>Anyhow, I knew we couldn't 
count on him to raise you.</b>

14:14.900 --> 14:18.850
<b>So we don't know anything 
about your mother.</b>

14:20.270 --> 14:21.790
<b>Mito even yelled,</b>

14:21.790 --> 14:26.070
<b>"Don't you ever come back!" 
while she cried...</b>

14:26.070 --> 14:27.170
<b>Grandma!</b>

14:27.620 --> 14:32.100
<b>Anyway, Ging left this with us then.</b>

14:35.110 --> 14:38.970
<b>This girl's tried to throw it away 
so many times...</b>

14:38.970 --> 14:44.110
<b>That's because you always 
put it back where it was!</b>

14:44.110 --> 14:46.040
<b>If you wanted to get rid of it,</b>

14:46.040 --> 14:50.300
<b>you should have buried or burned it, 
rather than tossing it in the trash can.</b>

14:56.870 --> 14:58.120
<b>Do you understand?</b>

15:00.270 --> 15:01.810
<b>That's it.</b>

15:02.330 --> 15:05.500
<b>That's all I know about Ging.</b>

15:10.320 --> 15:11.640
<b>Ging...</b>

15:12.710 --> 15:14.050
<b>Ging, huh?</b>

15:14.680 --> 15:17.050
<b>Ging... Ging...</b>

15:17.410 --> 15:20.860
<b>Yeah, I'll use that.</b>

15:21.860 --> 15:23.130
<b>Hey, Mito-san...</b>

15:23.130 --> 15:24.770
<b>Tell me more about</b>

15:24.770 --> 15:26.890
<b>what Ging was like when he was little!</b>

15:28.000 --> 15:28.810
<b>Huh?</b>

15:28.810 --> 15:31.460
<b>Does it sound weird for me 
to use his name?</b>

15:31.460 --> 15:34.020
<b>Somehow, it feels more natural.</b>

15:34.630 --> 15:36.790
<b>No, that isn't it.</b>

15:37.560 --> 15:39.940
<b>You want to hear what Ging 
was like as a child?</b>

15:39.940 --> 15:41.040
<b>Yeah!</b>

15:44.310 --> 15:48.250
<b>Hey, did Ging have any friends his age?</b>

15:48.250 --> 15:50.610
<b>No, he didn't.</b>

15:50.880 --> 15:53.050
<b>Ging and I were the only children around.</b>

15:53.430 --> 15:57.490
<b>So I always wanted him to play with me,</b>

15:57.490 --> 15:59.890
<b>but he would always run off.</b>

15:59.890 --> 16:03.600
<b>You were always getting lost.</b>

16:04.460 --> 16:07.070
<b>Honestly, you only remember 
the embarrassing stuff!</b>

16:08.410 --> 16:11.030
<b>You followed Ging into the mountains,</b>

16:11.030 --> 16:13.140
<b>but then you didn't come back.</b>

16:13.140 --> 16:15.090
<b>When Ging returned by himself,</b>

16:15.090 --> 16:19.020
<b>the whole village panicked. 
And that happened several times.</b>

16:20.060 --> 16:22.550
<b>But when we went to look 
for you in the mountains,</b>

16:22.550 --> 16:26.300
<b>Ging was always the first to find you.</b>

16:26.300 --> 16:29.590
<b>No matter where you hid...</b>

16:30.410 --> 16:32.590
<b>After a few times,</b>

16:32.590 --> 16:37.270
<b>people started wondering if you 
two were just playing pranks.</b>

16:37.270 --> 16:38.460
<b>What?!</b>

16:38.460 --> 16:40.920
<b>I would never do that!</b>

16:40.920 --> 16:44.660
<b>Well, you always hid in places</b>

16:44.660 --> 16:46.930
<b>that were impossible to locate.</b>

16:46.930 --> 16:49.880
<b>It was like you didn't want to be found.</b>

16:50.480 --> 16:52.580
<b>Really?</b>

17:19.740 --> 17:22.020
<b>I guess so...</b>

17:25.350 --> 17:27.800
<b>Oh, that reminds me of this other time.</b>

17:27.800 --> 17:29.250
<b>Ging and I were...</b>

17:40.690 --> 17:42.090
<b>Oh?</b>

17:44.010 --> 17:45.290
<b>I see.</b>

17:45.630 --> 17:47.810
<b>So this is the box.</b>

17:49.090 --> 17:50.040
<b>Huh?</b>

17:51.290 --> 17:54.150
<b>How do you open it?</b>

17:54.150 --> 17:56.590
<b>Yeah, I tried a bunch of methods,</b>

17:56.590 --> 17:58.280
<b>but it wouldn't open.</b>

17:58.620 --> 18:00.500
<b>Mind if I use force?</b>

18:00.500 --> 18:01.810
<b>Go ahead.</b>

18:02.170 --> 18:03.400
<b>Okay...</b>

18:10.860 --> 18:12.050
<b>It's no use.</b>

18:12.050 --> 18:13.770
<b>This is no ordinary box.</b>

18:13.770 --> 18:16.840
<b>I should be able to twist 
open an ordinary steel box.</b>

18:18.170 --> 18:23.040
<b>And since we don't know what's inside, 
we can't break the box.</b>

18:23.040 --> 18:24.480
<b>It's not making a sound.</b>

18:26.590 --> 18:28.050
<b>Your dad said</b>

18:28.050 --> 18:31.690
<b>to give this to you once you 
became a Hunter, right?</b>

18:31.690 --> 18:33.450
<b>Yeah, that's what I heard.</b>

18:34.300 --> 18:37.380
<b>Once you became a Hunter...</b>

18:44.120 --> 18:45.600
<b>I get it...</b>

18:45.880 --> 18:46.920
<b>I figured it out!</b>

18:47.620 --> 18:50.860
<b>Gon, there's one thing we haven't tried yet!</b>

18:50.860 --> 18:51.800
<b>Huh?</b>

18:51.800 --> 18:55.810
<b>Something you have as a Hunter 
that you didn't have before.</b>

18:55.810 --> 18:57.110
<b>Oh, I know!</b>

18:57.840 --> 18:59.360
<b>My Hunter License!</b>

18:59.360 --> 19:03.250
<b>But there isn't an opening for the card...</b>

19:03.250 --> 19:05.220
<b>No, that isn't it.</b>

19:05.220 --> 19:06.600
<b>I meant <i>Nen</i>...</b>

19:28.730 --> 19:31.500
<b>There's another box inside.</b>

19:36.430 --> 19:37.950
<b>These are just steel plates.</b>

19:38.980 --> 19:41.320
<b>It appears nothing was connecting them.</b>

19:42.640 --> 19:43.630
<b>What's wrong?</b>

19:44.920 --> 19:46.080
<b>Doesn't that design</b>

19:46.550 --> 19:47.950
<b>look familiar?</b>

19:48.650 --> 19:50.080
<b>This is...</b>

19:50.080 --> 19:51.210
<b>I know!</b>

19:51.840 --> 19:56.300
<b>This is like the pattern on the promise 
thread Wing-san gave me.</b>

19:58.380 --> 19:59.760
<b>Wasn't that designed</b>

19:59.760 --> 20:03.720
<b>to snap if <i>Nen</i> was used?</b>

20:05.920 --> 20:10.020
<b>I bet this pattern holds a 
power similar to <i>Nen</i>.</b>

20:10.340 --> 20:11.730
<b>Maybe we're supposed</b>

20:12.030 --> 20:14.200
<b>to put the card in here now.</b>

20:17.350 --> 20:18.250
<b>It worked!</b>

20:18.250 --> 20:19.310
<b>Bingo!</b>

20:21.730 --> 20:22.990
<b>A ring</b>

20:22.990 --> 20:24.960
<b>and a cassette tape...</b>

20:24.960 --> 20:26.400
<b>And a memory card?</b>

20:29.030 --> 20:30.000
<b>Look.</b>

20:30.490 --> 20:33.350
<b>That pattern is on the back of this ring.</b>

20:33.350 --> 20:35.830
<b>You should take care before you put it on.</b>

20:35.830 --> 20:37.090
<b>Really?</b>

20:37.090 --> 20:38.500
<b>You think that Ging</b>

20:38.500 --> 20:41.140
<b>might try to hurt me?</b>

20:41.640 --> 20:43.510
<b>Just to be safe.</b>

20:44.120 --> 20:47.480
<b>Well, we can start by listening to the tape.</b>

20:48.550 --> 20:49.800
<b>I guess.</b>

20:49.800 --> 20:51.800
<b>Oh, can you copy it?</b>

20:51.800 --> 20:53.770
<b>Sure, why?</b>

20:54.190 --> 20:55.700
<b>Just to be safe.</b>

21:16.700 --> 21:18.340
<b><i>Yo, Gon...</i></b>

21:20.980 --> 21:23.640
<b><i>So you became a Hunter, too.</i></b>

21:25.310 --> 21:28.360
<b><i>Anyway, I have a question for you.</i></b>

21:31.330 --> 21:34.520
<b><i>Do you want to see me?</i></b>

21:38.370 --> 21:41.650
<b>It was the first time Gon had 
heard his father's voice.</b>

21:42.020 --> 21:43.070
<b>Ging appeared</b>

21:43.070 --> 21:45.840
<b>to have read Gon's mind</b>

21:45.840 --> 21:49.280
<b>when he recorded his question.</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.110
<b>Brush Your Teeth.

<b>Today, we introduce Mito-san!</b>

23:11.290 --> 23:12.400
<b>She raised me.</b>

23:11.510 --> 23:13.780
<b>Raised Gon and has been 
waiting on Whale Island</b>

23:12.400 --> 23:14.820
<b>To me, Mito-san will always be my mom.</b>

23:13.780 --> 23:15.450
<b>for Gon to return.</b>

23:14.820 --> 23:17.440
<b>I wish I had a mom like Mito-san...</b>

23:15.450 --> 23:19.960
<b>Ging's cousin and 
childhood friend.</b>

23:17.440 --> 23:18.270
<b>She's the best,</b>
