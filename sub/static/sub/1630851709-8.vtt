█

00:01.034 --> 00:07.607
reads words on screen

00:10.043 --> 00:13.546
<i>Tonight, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada...</i>

00:15.815 --> 00:18.551
We're just less than a week
away from the final rose.

00:18.618 --> 00:19.419
There are certain
conversations that

00:19.486 --> 00:21.521
have to be talked
about around here.

00:21.588 --> 00:23.256
- Are you nervous?
- For the end?

00:23.323 --> 00:25.258
Engagement?

00:25.325 --> 00:28.027
I want to make things work and
I want to see it through.

00:28.094 --> 00:30.630
I've been looking for Kamil
to kind of step up.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.665
I'm just hoping that
he's as serious

00:32.732 --> 00:34.601
about this
relationship as I am.

00:34.667 --> 00:37.570
Normally, like this is the time
where I hit the panic button.

00:40.840 --> 00:42.976
Right when things are
settling down a bit,

00:43.042 --> 00:44.511
we're gonna mix it up.

00:44.577 --> 00:47.046
Woohoo!
Holy shit!

00:47.113 --> 00:48.882
I'm sure there's a couple
smooches going on.

00:48.948 --> 00:49.916
Honestly, you seem
like a nice guy.

00:49.983 --> 00:53.420
And I don't want to hurt you
so, don't ask Vay.

00:53.486 --> 00:54.454
You took her on the date,
didn't you?

00:54.521 --> 00:55.422
- I did.
- How was that?

00:55.488 --> 00:56.322
Fantastic.

00:56.389 --> 00:59.392
Josh, he's not really
competition, no.

00:59.459 --> 01:01.895
I'm on the chopping block.
"Cha-cha"!

01:01.961 --> 01:03.563
You just kept feeding me,
like,

01:03.630 --> 01:06.332
all these like amazing
things about her.

01:06.399 --> 01:08.001
I think any girl would feel
like shit hearing that.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.469
Yeah, absolutely.

01:09.536 --> 01:11.004
I'm not feeling too
good right now.

01:14.541 --> 01:18.311
Vay is getting in my head
more than I already was.

01:18.378 --> 01:19.979
I wasn't trying to side
with someone else.

01:20.046 --> 01:22.081
I was just trying to help
someone who had

01:22.148 --> 01:23.616
no one at the time.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.852
I'm scared of losing her.

01:42.569 --> 01:47.373
I feel right now that all the
roses are spoken for.

01:47.440 --> 01:49.108
Going into this rose ceremony,

01:49.175 --> 01:51.978
the only thing I'm hoping
for is for people to...

01:52.045 --> 01:55.415
actually give me a chance.

01:59.519 --> 02:00.753
At this point,
I'm pretty clear that

02:00.820 --> 02:02.722
things with Josh are not
going anywhere.

02:02.789 --> 02:05.625
I haven't been able to
establish a proper connection

02:05.692 --> 02:09.128
and I don't like being
in the unknown.

02:09.195 --> 02:11.865
I feel like I'm still
kind of lost in this.

02:11.931 --> 02:14.534
You can't guarantee
someone a rose here.

02:14.601 --> 02:16.503
You have to really
consider everyone.

02:18.872 --> 02:20.473
Good evening, everyone.

02:20.540 --> 02:23.476
For many of you, this
time here in Paradise is

02:23.543 --> 02:27.714
leading to exactly what
you came here for.

02:27.780 --> 02:30.984
True and lasting love.

02:31.050 --> 02:34.621
For those of you who've come to
Paradise more recently,

02:34.687 --> 02:36.923
you may be noticing that
it's difficult to find

02:36.990 --> 02:40.159
those connections, at this
stage in the journey.

02:40.226 --> 02:43.930
But, don't forget, anything can
happen in Paradise,

02:43.997 --> 02:47.734
and you never know what's
around the corner.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.770
With that said, gentlemen...

02:50.837 --> 02:53.640
you'll be handing out
the roses tonight.

02:53.706 --> 02:55.942
And ladies, unfortunately,

02:56.009 --> 03:00.547
four of you will be
leaving Paradise.

03:00.613 --> 03:03.416
T-ka, t-ka, t-ka, t-ka,
t-ka, t-ka! Remix!

03:05.752 --> 03:08.588
I had a blast.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.790
But I'm peacing out.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.158
- Oh, no!
- Oh, wow.

03:12.225 --> 03:13.860
Really? Wow.

03:13.927 --> 03:15.662
Bye!

03:15.728 --> 03:17.130
- Okay.
- Bye, Iva!

03:17.197 --> 03:18.364
I have a pretty decent ego.

03:18.431 --> 03:21.067
And that ego will be a little
bit sad when all those girls

03:21.134 --> 03:24.204
have a rose and I'm walking
home on my first week.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.940
- Wow.
- I'm done.

03:27.006 --> 03:29.042
And with that...

03:29.108 --> 03:31.711
Let's get started.
Kamil.

03:42.188 --> 03:46.225
Caitlin...

03:46.292 --> 03:49.796
Before you accept this rose,
I just wanted to ask you

03:49.862 --> 03:52.732
if you'll be my girlfriend?

03:52.799 --> 03:54.934
Oh, my God, yeah.

03:59.205 --> 04:00.707
Exciting!

04:00.773 --> 04:03.977
Brendan S.

04:04.043 --> 04:08.514
Illeana...

04:08.581 --> 04:10.250
Illeana, will you
accept this rose?

04:10.316 --> 04:12.518
100,000%.

04:17.056 --> 04:18.658
Brendan M.

04:31.671 --> 04:34.173
Angela...

04:34.240 --> 04:36.109
Angela, will you
accept this rose?

04:36.175 --> 04:39.679
I will, thank you.

04:39.746 --> 04:41.814
Alex.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.089
Kit...

04:50.156 --> 04:53.926
Aw...

04:53.993 --> 04:55.662
Do you accept this rose?

04:55.728 --> 04:57.063
I do.

04:57.130 --> 05:00.833
Joey.

05:00.900 --> 05:03.703
My relationship with Maria
is strictly platonic.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.538
Vay's not having it.

05:05.605 --> 05:08.274
I just don't agree with him.
I was excited to spend this

05:08.341 --> 05:12.178
cocktail hour with him. And his
focus was on someone else and,

05:12.245 --> 05:15.615
it didn't make me feel good.

05:15.682 --> 05:17.150
Vay.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.322
Will you accept this rose?

05:23.389 --> 05:25.992
Always.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.827
Mike.

05:35.902 --> 05:37.637
Stacy...

05:41.741 --> 05:44.310
Will you accept this
heavy metal rose?

05:44.377 --> 05:46.679
I will.

05:51.651 --> 05:54.654
Now unless
something changes...

05:54.721 --> 05:58.191
I'm going home tonight.

05:58.257 --> 05:59.892
Josh.

06:08.067 --> 06:10.169
Okay.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.808
I feel like I'm in a good
place with Josh.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.944
And I do really want more
time with him.

06:18.010 --> 06:20.213
So, I hope he
feels the same way.

06:22.915 --> 06:25.284
Lisa and I are in a space
where we're trying to

06:25.351 --> 06:27.353
figure out what this is and
what it means to us.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.622
But, if I could get
more time with Maria,

06:29.689 --> 06:32.225
absolutely I would love to
get to know her more.

06:32.291 --> 06:34.260
What if one conversation
today with somebody

06:34.327 --> 06:36.396
totally changes his mind?

06:36.462 --> 06:38.831
You never know in Paradise.

06:38.898 --> 06:42.168
No matter what I do tonight,
people are gonna get hurt.

06:46.806 --> 06:48.141
Lisa.

06:54.413 --> 06:55.681
Will you accept this rose?

06:55.748 --> 06:58.351
Absolutely.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.385
Thank you.

06:59.452 --> 07:01.254
Of course.

07:14.967 --> 07:16.702
Oh.

07:16.769 --> 07:19.705
Oh,

07:19.772 --> 07:23.843
Seeing Jesse with the rose kind
of gave a little glimmer of

07:23.910 --> 07:26.112
hope that I could stay
in Paradise.

07:26.179 --> 07:30.449
So, you may have realized
that I didn't announce

07:30.516 --> 07:33.719
the final rose
for the evening.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.254
And that's because...

07:35.321 --> 07:37.023
it wasn't.

07:40.526 --> 07:46.165
I have a special rose for a
special lady who deserves

07:46.232 --> 07:49.068
another shot at
love here in Paradise.

07:49.135 --> 07:51.804
Gentlemen, it's up
to you to decide,

07:51.871 --> 07:55.308
of the three women who remain,
which one should

07:55.374 --> 07:57.343
stay with us
here in Paradise.

08:02.381 --> 08:04.116
Huddle up.

08:06.953 --> 08:08.321
I'll say Maria right away.

08:08.387 --> 08:10.256
I think Maria should get it.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.826
I feel like Nicole
should get it.

08:13.893 --> 08:15.161
I wanted to be able to like
at least have

08:15.228 --> 08:18.097
the opportunity to like
have my own story.

08:18.164 --> 08:22.068
It's like too much for me.

08:22.134 --> 08:24.170
- I say Bianka.
- Bianka...

08:29.842 --> 08:31.944
This is the final rose
of the evening.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.880
So, when you're ready...

08:41.187 --> 08:42.989
Maria...

08:50.396 --> 08:53.332
Maria, do you
accept this rose?

08:56.569 --> 08:59.038
Yes, thank you.

09:05.845 --> 09:08.314
For the two of you ladies
who did not receive a rose,

09:08.381 --> 09:11.017
it's time for you to say
your goodbyes.

09:12.618 --> 09:15.922
- I wish it was you.
- Aw.

09:15.988 --> 09:18.057
At least I had fun.

09:18.124 --> 09:20.092
I'm leaving here single,
but that doesn't mean

09:20.159 --> 09:22.061
I'm gonna be single forever.

09:22.128 --> 09:25.097
I'm still hopeful and I know
my person is out there.

09:25.164 --> 09:27.166
I'm single and I'm
ready to mingle.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.306
Paradise was a
rollercoaster,

09:33.372 --> 09:35.508
but I can only take
away the highs.

09:35.575 --> 09:40.146
I definitely learned a lot
about myself and what I want.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.465
- It's a little chilly today.
- Yeah, another cold day.

11:06.532 --> 11:08.134
It's a new day in Paradise.

11:08.200 --> 11:10.403
I'm feeling
pretty damn good.

11:10.469 --> 11:13.572
I don't think anything could
make today a bad day.

11:15.975 --> 11:17.476
Nice, you look like a burrito.

11:17.543 --> 11:22.415
-
- Oh, my gosh.

11:22.481 --> 11:25.384
The women are back in power.

11:25.451 --> 11:27.920
But I'm not feeling too good
right now ́cause

11:27.987 --> 11:30.423
I think Joey and I definitely
need to have a chat.

11:32.625 --> 11:35.928
The last conversation we had
ended on a negative note.

11:35.995 --> 11:37.129
I don't know, I'm...

11:37.196 --> 11:40.266
just, I've been living in my
head for the last 12 hours.

11:40.332 --> 11:43.469
Just over thinking everything.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.638
I don't know, I couldn't
really sleep last night.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.206
Honestly, the minute
I give her a hug,

11:47.273 --> 11:48.941
everything's just gonna
float away anyway so,

11:49.008 --> 11:50.142
it's not even gonna matter.

11:50.209 --> 11:54.513
I guarantee you, I'm gonna go
from here to here.

11:54.580 --> 11:58.651
Ow, you just took my headband.

12:02.588 --> 12:05.458
Hey, fellas, it's been
a long, long day.

12:05.524 --> 12:06.659
You know,
we had a crazy night.

12:06.725 --> 12:09.161
You guys want to let off some
steam and play some ball?

12:09.228 --> 12:11.564
- Oh, yeah, I'm down.
- Yeah? Alright, let's go.

12:11.630 --> 12:12.998
- Hell, yeah.
- Let's do it.

12:17.303 --> 12:19.638
- Alright.
- Guess we're playing some ball.

12:19.705 --> 12:21.507
Bye, ladies!

12:26.412 --> 12:28.280
- Nice.
- Here you go.

12:28.347 --> 12:29.515
Here you go, man.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.016
Oh-ho!

12:31.083 --> 12:33.018
We're on the same team, bro!

12:33.085 --> 12:35.421
Ah!

12:35.488 --> 12:37.456
Did I do
something wrong, or...?

12:37.523 --> 12:40.426
Was I just trying to
help out a friend?

12:40.493 --> 12:42.394
I don't even know
what's going on,

12:42.461 --> 12:45.431
to be honest with you.

12:45.498 --> 12:47.266
- Bro.
- Hey, buddy.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.502
What's up, man?

12:49.568 --> 12:53.005
Having a
rough one, ah?

12:53.072 --> 12:54.373
Yep.

12:54.440 --> 12:58.577
Vay is getting in my head
more than I already was.

12:58.644 --> 13:00.679
Seeing you...

13:00.746 --> 13:02.648
I don't know, siding with
another girl, it kind of just,

13:02.715 --> 13:04.049
you know, triggered something.

13:04.116 --> 13:05.551
I wasn't trying to side
with someone else.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.586
I was just trying to help
someone who had

13:07.653 --> 13:09.054
no one at the time.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.023
Yeah.

13:11.090 --> 13:14.059
I'm scared of the
outcome of the

13:14.126 --> 13:16.428
possibility of
maybe losing her.

13:16.495 --> 13:18.631
She can't not be
in my life.

13:18.697 --> 13:21.200
Yeah, I don't know,
man, I just...

13:21.267 --> 13:23.169
I like that girl.

13:35.614 --> 13:37.483
You definitely learn things
about yourself in this place.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.252
Yeah, it's a very difficult,
like, environment.

13:40.319 --> 13:42.188
And especially if you've
never had an experience

13:42.254 --> 13:43.856
like this one, like you're
not used to it.

13:43.923 --> 13:47.293
It like brings out a lot of
sensitivity that you

13:47.359 --> 13:49.728
wouldn't necessarily
feel outside of this.

13:49.795 --> 13:52.198
Oh, yeah, how do you feel about
getting the group rose?

13:52.264 --> 13:55.367
I was a little bit
like not sure.

13:55.434 --> 13:58.771
And now I'm like way happier
than I was yesterday.

13:58.837 --> 14:02.107
I'm feeling a lot better
than I did last night.

14:06.212 --> 14:08.714
I do feel like I'm getting
another second chance.

14:08.781 --> 14:11.550
I was
feeling a lot, so like,

14:11.617 --> 14:15.821
today I'm like, ugh, like,
I'm super drained.

14:15.888 --> 14:17.556
The boys have
warmed up a little bit.

14:17.623 --> 14:19.258
I thought you were saying
when a new boy comes in,

14:19.325 --> 14:20.426
it's gonna that
things up a little bit.

14:20.492 --> 14:21.660
I know,
that's not what I meant.

14:21.727 --> 14:23.395
- But yeah, that could work too.
- I was like, "Yeah, girl"!

14:27.533 --> 14:29.602
- What?
- We got a guy coming in.

14:29.668 --> 14:30.836
What's up?

14:30.903 --> 14:32.471
He's got some swag.

14:32.538 --> 14:36.442
It's all girls, and we see a
guy coming towards us.

14:36.508 --> 14:38.911
And he looks totally my type
and I'm excited.

14:38.978 --> 14:40.212
Hi.

14:40.279 --> 14:42.581
Lisa lights up!
I'm excited for her.

14:42.648 --> 14:45.751
I hope that this could be a
potential connection for Lisa.

14:45.818 --> 14:48.420
Kind of looks like a mix
between Owen Wilson,

14:48.487 --> 14:50.756
Prince Harry,
and Bradley Cooper.

14:50.823 --> 14:52.291
I'm digging it.

14:52.358 --> 14:53.292
Am I the only guy?

14:53.359 --> 14:55.861
Hey, everybody, I'm Connor.
I'm 27 years old

14:55.928 --> 14:57.496
from Toronto,
and I'm a civil engineer

14:57.563 --> 14:58.797
in training to
be a firefighter.

14:58.864 --> 15:00.499
You get just the girls today,
you're lucky.

15:00.566 --> 15:02.401
- Yeah, what's going on?
- You're lucky.

15:02.468 --> 15:04.336
- This is Paradise.
-

15:04.403 --> 15:06.639
I walk into Paradise and
all I see is women,

15:06.705 --> 15:09.308
and I think to myself, am I
The Bachelor right now?

15:09.375 --> 15:11.343
- Hi, I'm Lisa.
- Hi, Lisa.

15:11.410 --> 15:12.177
Nice to meet you.

15:12.244 --> 15:14.246
So, the guys went to
play basketball,

15:14.313 --> 15:15.681
so you just have the girls.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.416
- Perfect timing.
- Perfect timing, yeah.

15:17.483 --> 15:19.418
So, women of Paradise,
I hope you're ready

15:19.485 --> 15:21.520
́cause a great
Canadian boy is on the way.

15:21.587 --> 15:22.621
I do have this.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.824
I know you guys know I'm
locked and loaded with this.

15:25.891 --> 15:27.359
"Let's get high."

15:27.426 --> 15:28.861
Oh! You're doing
that thing over there.

15:28.927 --> 15:30.796
That's gonna be fun,
it's gonna be fun.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.299
So, I need to have conversations
now with all the women and

15:33.365 --> 15:35.934
see if they want to explore
a relationship with me.

15:36.001 --> 15:37.269
There's a few people
that are in

15:37.336 --> 15:39.371
serious actual committed
relationships.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.373
I'm currently taken.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.808
I think what you have to do
is just always like

15:42.875 --> 15:43.909
go with your gut. Like,

15:44.009 --> 15:44.977
whenever I like talk to
somebody for the first time,

15:45.077 --> 15:48.414
I'm, I feel like there's a
vibe there or, or not.

15:48.480 --> 15:50.382
I've been hanging out with
Josh, who you'll probably

15:50.449 --> 15:52.551
meet later, but we're
both completely open.

15:52.618 --> 15:55.321
My journey here has been
like an underdog story.

15:55.387 --> 15:58.824
And just like every week I'm
just like, am I getting a rose?

15:58.891 --> 16:00.459
- Oh, really?
- Oh, yeah.

16:00.526 --> 16:01.827
I have not had an
easy time here.

16:01.894 --> 16:04.797
I genuinely feel like a
complete underdog story here

16:04.863 --> 16:07.633
with so many guys coming in and
not trying to get to know me.

16:07.700 --> 16:10.369
So, Connor's a breath
of fresh air for me.

16:10.436 --> 16:12.838
You'll find out a lot
about yourself and,

16:12.905 --> 16:14.640
you'll make friends
for life in here.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.909
Yeah, I'm looking forward to
meeting everybody.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.610
Like, you're awesome, so...

16:18.677 --> 16:20.245
- Aw, thank you.
- It's a good start.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.014
I think Connor is super cute.

16:22.081 --> 16:24.283
He seems super
genuine, super sweet.

16:24.350 --> 16:27.252
D-bag meter
is at a zero here.

16:27.319 --> 16:28.887
It's me like starting fresh,
quitting.

16:28.954 --> 16:30.622
Gotta follow your
passions, man.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.860
- Sorry, I know like-
- Hi.

16:34.927 --> 16:36.028
- Scared me.
- She's like...

16:36.095 --> 16:37.863
I didn't mean to scare you.

16:37.930 --> 16:39.665
What if I said "no"?
No, I'm kidding.

16:39.732 --> 16:40.933
No, we can all talk if you want.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.269
It's okay, I'll give you guys-
We'll talk about this later.

16:44.336 --> 16:46.939
It's thirsty Thursday
for Maria so...

16:47.005 --> 16:49.875
I guess, go ahead
and pull him.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.477
Have a good chat.

16:51.543 --> 16:53.412
Alright, I'll see you later,
Connor.

16:53.479 --> 16:55.581
- Well, it's nice to meet you.
- Yeah, nice to meet you.

16:55.647 --> 16:58.350
- How are you?
- Not bad, how are you?

16:58.417 --> 16:59.785
I'm good.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.887
I can tell you that like I
haven't really like...

17:01.954 --> 17:05.624
built anything with anyone,
so like...

17:05.691 --> 17:06.825
I'm super open, like...

17:06.892 --> 17:07.893
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

17:07.960 --> 17:08.994
You seem really confident.

17:09.061 --> 17:11.930
I guess you couldn't see
what was going on in here

17:11.997 --> 17:13.031
́cause I was freaking out.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.933
No, like I get it.
Last night,

17:15.000 --> 17:16.869
I feel like I was in like
a completely different...

17:16.935 --> 17:19.338
mindset than I have
today, yeah.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.039
Yeah.

17:21.106 --> 17:23.842
Lisa, we need the T.
We need to know...

17:23.909 --> 17:25.611
- About the mans?
- About this guy.

17:25.677 --> 17:27.679
- Oh, I really like him.
- Yeah?

17:27.746 --> 17:29.515
Yeah, he's nice and he
said I made him feel

17:29.581 --> 17:30.916
comfortable because
I don't shut up.

17:30.983 --> 17:32.751
But he seems like super sweet,
and he said he would

17:32.818 --> 17:34.553
like to come out of this
with a girlfriend.

17:34.620 --> 17:36.088
Aw.

17:38.424 --> 17:40.926
Lisa, you want to have just
another quick chat there, sorry?

17:40.993 --> 17:42.661
- Let's do this.
- I'm taking everybody's time.

17:42.728 --> 17:44.830
Don't be sorry.
I was gonna say...

17:47.566 --> 17:51.770
First impressions, like I did
enjoy our time talking and...

17:51.837 --> 17:54.506
Not gonna lie,
thought you were pretty cute

17:54.573 --> 17:55.974
when you were walking over.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.042
Have you been on one yet?

17:57.109 --> 17:58.710
I have not been on a
date here yet.

17:58.777 --> 18:00.846
Some people have been
on like three or four.

18:00.913 --> 18:02.848
Connor pulls me for a second
chat and even just

18:02.915 --> 18:04.983
being pulled for a second
conversation...

18:05.050 --> 18:07.519
made me happy and hopeful.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.955
And I didn't see him pull
anyone else so, we'll see.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.824
Oh, here are all the guys.

18:16.495 --> 18:18.797
I understand Joey's a good
guy and I understand that

18:18.864 --> 18:20.899
he wanted to be
there for Maria.

18:20.966 --> 18:24.636
Knowing that he was just so
concerned about another woman

18:24.703 --> 18:27.773
and, it wasn't
a good feeling.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.709
I just need to talk to him.

18:30.776 --> 18:32.845
Can I talk to you?

18:38.851 --> 18:40.552
I haven't seen you
smile once today.

18:40.619 --> 18:44.490
Only when
I look at you.

18:44.556 --> 18:45.657
You met...

18:45.724 --> 18:47.726
you met Vay and Joey?

18:47.793 --> 18:50.963
- No.
- Yeah.

18:58.036 --> 19:03.175
It's very, very, very,
very hard for me...

19:03.242 --> 19:05.410
to open up about how I feel.

19:05.477 --> 19:08.413
I know.

19:08.480 --> 19:11.116
You just kept feeding me,
like, all these like

19:11.183 --> 19:14.820
amazing things about her,
over and over again.

19:14.887 --> 19:15.854
- I'm sorry.
- And like, I think...

19:15.921 --> 19:17.623
...any girl would
feel like shit hearing that.

19:17.689 --> 19:18.724
Yeah, absolutely.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.860
I'm just over it, like, I don't
like feeling this way.

19:21.927 --> 19:23.962
I don't want to be the jealous,
crazy girlfriend.

19:24.029 --> 19:27.533
Like, that's not what I want,
but unfortunately that's...

19:27.599 --> 19:29.501
how I felt.

19:31.570 --> 19:35.474
I understand where you're
coming from. I really do.

19:35.541 --> 19:38.510
I wish I didn't care when you
spoke about another girl.

19:38.577 --> 19:40.646
And I wish I didn't care, but...

19:45.284 --> 19:48.020
If you want to be with me,
you need to understand that,

19:48.086 --> 19:50.822
like, it comes with
a lot of baggage.

19:50.889 --> 19:53.125
I know.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.960
I don't feel great.

19:55.027 --> 19:56.828
Why?

19:58.764 --> 20:00.699
́Cause I love you.

20:18.317 --> 20:21.987
And I hate that I'm
the reason that

20:22.054 --> 20:23.789
you felt the way you
did yesterday.

20:23.855 --> 20:27.926
Why?

20:27.993 --> 20:30.295
́Cause I love you.

20:33.665 --> 20:35.901
I don't want to make you
feel that way.

20:35.968 --> 20:39.871
I was just...

20:39.938 --> 20:44.710
Trying to be a good person
for people in need.

20:44.776 --> 20:47.012
But you are my #1 priority.

20:55.754 --> 21:00.592
Those words mean a lot to me,
and I know he means them.

21:00.659 --> 21:01.660
I'm sorry.

21:01.760 --> 21:05.597
But, what meant more to me
is that he said it in a

21:05.664 --> 21:09.268
conversation, and he didn't
expect me to say it back

21:09.334 --> 21:13.872
because he knows I'm gonna
need more time to get there.

21:13.939 --> 21:15.374
I promise I won't
do it again.

21:15.440 --> 21:18.277
Okay... Deal.

21:20.212 --> 21:22.114
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

21:22.180 --> 21:24.916
I know I'm falling in love
with him.

21:24.983 --> 21:27.085
I think he's my person.

21:27.152 --> 21:31.123
By the end of this conversation,
we are just...

21:31.189 --> 21:33.225
better than before.

21:35.394 --> 21:39.064
And I love her!

21:39.131 --> 21:43.001
Yay!

21:43.068 --> 21:44.936
- Wow.
- Wow.

21:47.239 --> 21:48.674
Wow.

21:50.442 --> 21:51.810
Kind of what I was a
little bit worried about.

21:51.877 --> 21:53.111
Like, coming here,
everybody's built

21:53.178 --> 21:54.179
connections and all that.

21:54.246 --> 21:55.180
Yeah.

21:55.247 --> 21:56.848
Whether you want to stay
here and you see someone

21:56.915 --> 21:58.250
catch your eye, or you
want to go home.

21:58.317 --> 21:59.651
So, that's up to you.

21:59.718 --> 22:01.086
Honestly, you see like
a nice guy.

22:01.153 --> 22:04.790
And I don't want to hurt you
so, don't ask Vay.

22:04.856 --> 22:07.192
I think, like, you should
make the decision that

22:07.259 --> 22:08.360
you want to make.

22:08.427 --> 22:11.196
Nobody here is gonna get mad
at you about it, trust me.

22:11.263 --> 22:11.997
Even Joey,
he's messing around,

22:12.097 --> 22:13.699
but he's not gonna
get mad at you.

22:16.301 --> 22:19.004
I am actually a bit nervous
watching Josh and Connor talk

22:19.071 --> 22:21.139
because I'm not sure if Josh
is saying one thing to me

22:21.206 --> 22:22.808
and then telling Connor,
like,

22:22.874 --> 22:24.776
"Just so you know like me
and Lisa are this."

22:24.843 --> 22:27.012
But hey, Josh had his
fun last week.

22:27.079 --> 22:29.247
I think it's time for the
kid to go on a date.

22:29.314 --> 22:32.150
Josh was literally The Bachelor
of Paradise last week

22:32.217 --> 22:34.453
and now it's my turn to
be Bachelorette.

22:34.519 --> 22:36.221
Lisa and I had a good chat.

22:36.288 --> 22:37.923
She's like super friendly
and outgoing.

22:37.989 --> 22:39.024
Just follow your heart, dude.

22:39.091 --> 22:40.358
If you're really feeling
someone and you feel like

22:40.425 --> 22:42.694
they're remotely open,
based on

22:42.761 --> 22:44.830
what they told you,
go for it, man.

22:44.896 --> 22:47.132
This decision is a lot harder
than I thought it was gonna be.

22:47.199 --> 22:49.701
There's a lot of relationships
already established here and

22:49.768 --> 22:51.837
I'm just trying to figure out
where I fit in, in the mix.

22:51.903 --> 22:54.940
It says so much, and I think
it makes people realize that

22:55.006 --> 22:56.842
their behaviour sucks and it
makes them want to-

22:56.908 --> 22:59.010
- Lisa?
- Hey.

22:59.077 --> 23:02.013
- You wanna go on this date?
- Let's do it.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.882
It's all I've
dreamed of, guys.

23:05.517 --> 23:08.220
Okay, now I just feel
embarrassed.

23:08.286 --> 23:09.755
Thank you, guys.

23:09.821 --> 23:11.356
I am so excited to get
to know Connor.

23:11.423 --> 23:13.992
It's nice that somebody finally
came in and actually wants to

23:14.059 --> 23:16.361
get to know me over the great
group of girls that we have.

23:19.264 --> 23:20.799
If I have a great time
with Connor,

23:20.866 --> 23:23.101
I will actually be worrying
about Josh because then

23:23.168 --> 23:25.270
I'll really have like a hard
decision to make.

23:29.841 --> 23:32.077
- Where are we going?
-

23:32.144 --> 23:34.479
To talk to you about your
feelings. Are you ready?

23:34.546 --> 23:38.083
We've seen a lot of
couples here, like...

23:38.150 --> 23:41.353
say that they want to be
official and like,

23:41.420 --> 23:43.321
I just want to make sure that
you're not feeling that way

23:43.388 --> 23:45.157
just because you think
it's like the next like

23:45.223 --> 23:48.260
natural progression here.

23:48.326 --> 23:51.496
I know that Kamil and Annalise
broke up after he was

23:51.563 --> 23:55.367
on Paradise in Mexico and,
that scares me.

23:55.433 --> 23:57.035
Just want to make sure that,
you know,

23:57.102 --> 24:00.939
after this it's not just gonna
be like an easy...

24:01.006 --> 24:02.874
let's just call it quits
kind of thing.

24:02.941 --> 24:03.909
Right, right.

24:03.975 --> 24:05.911
I've been in this position
before in Paradise.

24:05.977 --> 24:10.015
And, I left Paradise with a
girlfriend as well, but like,

24:10.081 --> 24:12.984
I just want to be 100%
confident that whoever I leave

24:13.051 --> 24:16.788
with, you're gonna be my girl
outside of this, you know?

24:16.855 --> 24:19.291
I'm just hoping that he's as
serious about

24:19.357 --> 24:21.226
this relationship as I am.

24:25.864 --> 24:28.400
- We are a week away.
- Are you nervous?

24:28.467 --> 24:32.270
- What, for the end?
- Engagement.

24:34.005 --> 24:38.143
The engagement?
That sounds so crazy to me.

24:38.210 --> 24:42.380
But I also don't want to
scratch it off the table.

24:42.447 --> 24:45.517
We're just less than a week
away from the final rose and,

24:45.584 --> 24:47.986
there's certain conversations
that have to be talked about

24:48.053 --> 24:50.489
around here and, it's,
it's kind of like

24:50.555 --> 24:52.023
the elephant in the room.

24:52.090 --> 24:56.261
What's your fave ring style?
Like, I'm just curious.

24:56.328 --> 25:00.065
- Are you?
- I am.

25:00.131 --> 25:03.134
Like a princess cut or
a radiant cut.

25:03.201 --> 25:05.871
- Can you explain them?
-

25:05.937 --> 25:07.839
We've made it this
far together,

25:07.906 --> 25:09.975
and I think we're both
really happy.

25:10.041 --> 25:11.376
But like, if I didn't
have a say in it,

25:11.443 --> 25:14.279
he would just straight,
headfirst into an engagement

25:14.346 --> 25:16.147
and not really think about...

25:16.214 --> 25:20.485
anything else, and how we
work outside of here.

25:20.552 --> 25:24.556
I just want to be happy with
you and leave with you.

25:24.623 --> 25:26.591
Just want you to
be happy though.

25:38.136 --> 25:39.571
This is definitely the
most daring date

25:39.638 --> 25:41.640
anyone's had here,
that's for sure.

25:41.706 --> 25:44.476
This ropes course
is definitely high.

25:44.542 --> 25:47.445
I'm looking up at it and I'm
thinking I'm gonna die.

25:47.512 --> 25:49.514
- You better enjoy it.
-

25:49.581 --> 25:51.216
- I'll meet you in the middle.
- Catch you in the middle.

25:51.283 --> 25:53.285
He's feeling a little nervous,
but I'm feeling pretty good

25:53.351 --> 25:55.887
about it ́cause I'm
channelling my inner squirrel.

25:55.954 --> 25:57.088
What are we gonna do?

25:57.155 --> 25:59.024
Ah!

25:59.090 --> 26:01.960
- Stop wobbling it.
- You're shaking it, bud.

26:02.027 --> 26:03.595
I'm holding on for
my life here.

26:03.662 --> 26:06.331
I got little arms.
I'm so disadvantaged.

26:06.398 --> 26:09.167
You know, putting a harness
on and a go-pro helmet

26:09.234 --> 26:11.937
isn't usually sexy,
but somehow...

26:12.003 --> 26:13.371
Connor makes it work.

26:13.438 --> 26:15.373
We're gonna have to go
butt to butt here.

26:15.440 --> 26:18.043
I see you, boy.

26:18.109 --> 26:19.144
- You!
- Ah!

26:19.210 --> 26:20.679
- Oh, you're good, nice.
- Oh, my God.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.481
You good?

26:23.548 --> 26:25.617
This is way harder
than it looks, eh?

26:25.684 --> 26:28.253
Crossing paths, up in the
air on the tightrope,

26:28.320 --> 26:31.189
definitely brought us closer
together, quite literally.

26:32.557 --> 26:33.425
It feels great.

26:33.525 --> 26:37.062
She's so full of life and,
makes you enjoy

26:37.128 --> 26:38.630
everything going on
in the moment.

26:38.697 --> 26:40.966
Ah!

26:41.032 --> 26:43.702
Okay, that part was fun.
I like this part.

26:53.545 --> 26:55.380
-
- Oh, that still scared me.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.349
Time for some refreshing
drinks after a...

26:57.415 --> 26:59.651
After a
long work out.

26:59.718 --> 27:01.953
There's a beautiful
couch laid out.

27:02.020 --> 27:05.624
Some bubbly ready for us.
The mood is just perfect.

27:05.690 --> 27:08.226
We should cheers to surviving.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.462
- Surviving.
- And, my first...

27:10.528 --> 27:11.429
- Date.
- Our first date.

27:11.496 --> 27:13.598
Our first date, oh.
Maybe there'll be more.

27:13.665 --> 27:15.600
Hm.

27:15.667 --> 27:18.103
I honestly feel like if it
weren't for you, like,

27:18.169 --> 27:19.738
if it was somebody else
here, I'd feel like-

27:19.804 --> 27:21.573
- A little awkward?
- More nervous.

27:21.640 --> 27:24.509
Yeah, with you, it doesn't
really feel awkward.

27:24.576 --> 27:27.512
Today is definitely one of
the more overwhelming days

27:27.579 --> 27:29.180
I've had in my life.

27:29.247 --> 27:31.383
Lisa's almost acted as
like a crutch for me.

27:31.449 --> 27:33.718
I kind of feel like she's there
to kind of laugh everything off

27:33.785 --> 27:37.722
and, make this all kind of not
feel so overwhelming.

27:37.789 --> 27:40.425
Are you pretty close
with your family?

27:40.492 --> 27:41.559
Ah, yeah, actually.

27:41.626 --> 27:43.728
It's funny ́cause my family
has no idea I'm here.

27:43.795 --> 27:46.631
I just like can't wait to see
their reaction when this airs

27:46.698 --> 27:48.433
and they have no idea
that I was gone.

27:48.500 --> 27:51.069
I have two sisters
and a brother.

27:51.136 --> 27:53.772
And my mother, my dad actually
passed away in 2020.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.106
- Oh, geez.
- Yeah.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.574
- Sorry to hear.
- It's okay.

27:56.641 --> 27:57.575
He would've loved to
hear about this,

27:57.642 --> 27:59.544
he would have been-
I don't want to cry, but

27:59.611 --> 28:00.612
he would've been the
only family member

28:00.679 --> 28:03.014
that I told that
I was coming.

28:03.081 --> 28:07.252
- Um, sorry.
- That's alright.

28:10.822 --> 28:12.424
It's just like a
little too new.

28:12.490 --> 28:15.326
Yeah.

28:15.393 --> 28:20.799
Yeah, he would've
like loved to see this.

28:20.865 --> 28:23.735
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- It's okay.

28:23.802 --> 28:26.471
It was just like
really sudden, so...

28:28.506 --> 28:29.674
Thanks.

28:29.741 --> 28:34.145
It's really hard to bring up my
dad's passing with somebody.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.114
Um...

28:42.554 --> 28:47.192
Um, yeah, I don't really
know what else to say there.

28:47.258 --> 28:50.361
In some magical way or form,
he knows that I'm here.

28:50.428 --> 28:52.297
I appreciate you even,
like, telling me.

28:52.363 --> 28:53.131
Yeah.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.100
I'm really glad that
you said yes.

28:55.166 --> 28:56.367
And I'm really
glad I asked you.

28:56.434 --> 28:58.203
- Oh...
- I'm serious.

28:58.269 --> 28:59.270
That's fun.

28:59.337 --> 29:02.607
I haven't brought up my
dad's passing to anybody.

29:02.674 --> 29:05.643
He said he really appreciated
me opening up to him about it.

29:05.710 --> 29:07.345
I thought you were
gonna be funny.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.513
And you are.

29:08.580 --> 29:11.182
Yes,
I get funny points.

29:11.249 --> 29:14.319
He said he likes funny girls!
I'll take that.

29:14.385 --> 29:16.755
I was looking for somebody that
raises squirrels and...

29:19.390 --> 29:22.327
And I'm like, hopeful that we
can keep pursuing this.

29:22.393 --> 29:24.262
Yeah.

29:27.632 --> 29:29.534
When I kiss Connor,
I feel sparks.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.836
And when I kiss Josh...

29:31.903 --> 29:36.141
It feels more like a friend.

29:36.207 --> 29:38.777
It's genuinely hurting me
because we haven't had a

29:38.843 --> 29:41.880
conversation where he's come
back from a date and felt like

29:41.946 --> 29:48.586
a girl stood a chance and now
I'm really kind of confused.

29:48.653 --> 29:50.722
I don't want to hurt anybody.

29:57.896 --> 30:00.798
- The raccoons of Paradise.
- The racoons of Paradise.

30:00.865 --> 30:02.367
- Squirrel!
- Squirrel!

30:02.433 --> 30:03.902
Where's Lisa?

30:03.968 --> 30:05.537
So, how do you guys
think that the,

30:05.603 --> 30:07.405
the date's going between
Lisa and Connor?

30:07.472 --> 30:09.140
She actually seemed
really excited to go.

30:09.207 --> 30:10.141
- Yeah.
- She did.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.342
She genuinely did.

30:11.409 --> 30:14.245
Lisa is on a date with
a really nice guy.

30:18.349 --> 30:19.817
Connor being
Lisa's type means

30:19.884 --> 30:22.820
I'm on the chopping block.
"Cha-cha"!

30:32.330 --> 30:33.631
I feel good.

30:33.698 --> 30:35.533
- You happy you came?
- Yeah.

30:35.600 --> 30:36.768
It's just like, we think,

30:36.835 --> 30:38.603
we think about stuff
the same a lot.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.506
People just take people
for granted and

30:41.573 --> 30:43.908
don't value what they have.

30:43.975 --> 30:45.543
Excuse me, guys.

30:45.610 --> 30:48.546
May I ask my special lady
for a, a nice night?

30:48.613 --> 30:50.215
- Aw!
- Yeah!

30:50.281 --> 30:53.952
Aw.
That is so exciting.

30:55.987 --> 30:58.389
Tonight's a big night to
figure stuff out.

30:58.456 --> 30:59.958
Is tonight the night?

31:00.024 --> 31:02.894
I think she needs that
reassurance, like, leaving here.

31:02.961 --> 31:06.431
Kamil gets a little lazy with
their relationship.

31:06.497 --> 31:10.969
And, doesn't always prove to
her how much he cares for her.

31:11.035 --> 31:16.374
She just wants him to show
her through his actions

31:16.441 --> 31:19.344
how much he
really likes her.

31:19.410 --> 31:21.746
Not everyone can be
Brendan S., so...

31:28.820 --> 31:32.724
- Wow!
- Aw, this is so cute!

31:32.790 --> 31:34.959
- Clementines!
-

31:35.026 --> 31:37.929
Thank you.

31:37.996 --> 31:40.898
My nickname for Caitlin
is Clementine.

31:40.965 --> 31:42.500
-
- Woo!

31:42.567 --> 31:43.868
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

31:43.935 --> 31:45.436
Thanks for setting this up.

31:45.503 --> 31:47.772
I wanted to put together
something special for tonight.

31:47.839 --> 31:51.276
It's been awhile since
there was just us two.

31:51.342 --> 31:54.012
I want to make things work and
I want to see it through.

31:54.078 --> 31:56.447
- Right.
- And, and I...

31:56.514 --> 31:58.483
I don't know, I was just
hoping that you're feeling the

31:58.549 --> 32:00.318
same way and that this
isn't gonna be like

32:00.385 --> 32:03.021
some sort of short-term
thing here.

32:03.087 --> 32:06.824
Yeah, no, I'm definitely
feeling the same way.

32:06.891 --> 32:09.427
I've been looking for Kamil
to kind of step up and

32:09.494 --> 32:11.529
do something special for us.

32:11.596 --> 32:15.466
If he's not stepping up to
make some sort of effort here,

32:15.533 --> 32:18.002
how is that gonna
translate to us being

32:18.069 --> 32:19.904
a plane ride away
from each other?

32:19.971 --> 32:23.074
You're somebody who
doesn't often, like,

32:23.141 --> 32:25.543
overly express your emotions.
And that's okay and...

32:25.610 --> 32:26.978
Yeah.

32:27.045 --> 32:29.080
At the right place, right time,
I talk about my emotions,

32:29.147 --> 32:31.082
but they don't always come out.

32:31.149 --> 32:34.319
I kind of grew up in a household
where like my father really...

32:34.385 --> 32:38.022
didn't talk about emotions to
my mom. Or say 'I love you'

32:38.089 --> 32:41.426
or anything like that
in the household.

32:41.492 --> 32:43.428
It's just who I am.
Everyone expresses

32:43.494 --> 32:46.364
their feelings and
emotions differently.

32:46.431 --> 32:51.436
I'm not the best at it,
but I have room to grow.

32:51.502 --> 32:53.938
I'm glad that you, you know,
we're together now.

32:54.005 --> 32:56.507
- And we're like exclusive.
- I know.

32:56.574 --> 32:58.743
It feels different for me
because like I haven't

32:58.810 --> 33:00.545
had a girlfriend in
like two years.

33:00.611 --> 33:01.579
It's been like a while.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.548
I mean, yeah,
I haven't been in

33:03.614 --> 33:05.116
a committed relationship in
a long time either.

33:05.183 --> 33:08.486
Yeah, when's the last time
you had a, a relationship?

33:08.553 --> 33:10.755
Oh, gosh, probably around
two years as well.

33:10.822 --> 33:12.957
Okay.

33:13.024 --> 33:16.894
But yeah, I mean, I, I think
the reason why I wanted to have

33:16.961 --> 33:19.464
the conversation, too,
I think normally like this is

33:19.530 --> 33:23.568
the time where I hit
the panic button.

33:23.634 --> 33:25.570
Any time that I get close to

33:25.636 --> 33:27.038
this kind of level
of commitment,

33:27.105 --> 33:30.908
I'm notorious for saying like,
"I'm out", because I,

33:30.975 --> 33:33.845
I don't want to get hurt.
I just need to let myself

33:33.911 --> 33:37.015
dive in and not be so
afraid of failing.

33:49.060 --> 33:51.662
Do you wanna go sit up by
the fire pit up there?

33:51.729 --> 33:53.765
Sure.

33:56.701 --> 33:59.537
I felt like last night, I mean,
when we talked-

33:59.604 --> 34:04.742
I feel like I pulled you aside
at the wrong time completely.

34:04.809 --> 34:07.545
It seemed like you had a lot of
stuff going on in that moment.

34:07.612 --> 34:11.482
I was just upset at
the fact that like,

34:11.549 --> 34:12.917
I just didn't have the
experience that

34:12.984 --> 34:15.186
I thought I was
going to have.

34:15.253 --> 34:16.054
And I didn't have the
experience that

34:16.154 --> 34:19.056
I really wanted to have.
And I feel like

34:19.123 --> 34:21.159
I took that out on you so,
I'm, I'm sorry.

34:21.225 --> 34:22.627
You don't have to apologize.

34:22.693 --> 34:23.661
It's also ́cause you're
probably like the

34:23.728 --> 34:25.563
easiest person to talk to.

34:25.630 --> 34:28.433
I'll take that
as a compliment.

34:28.499 --> 34:30.668
So, do you feel like there's
a possibility you could

34:30.735 --> 34:32.503
have the experience that you
want to have here?

34:32.570 --> 34:34.705
Maybe, I don't know.
I don't know yet.

34:34.772 --> 34:36.707
- Hm.
- Yeah.

34:36.774 --> 34:38.609
Outside of the world
of Paradise,

34:38.676 --> 34:41.679
Josh is the type of person that
I would be interested in.

34:44.916 --> 34:49.487
I haven't had like the
best luck in love.

34:49.554 --> 34:51.789
You're an incredibly
beautiful girl.

34:51.856 --> 34:54.992
It's interesting to me that
you feel that someone would

34:55.059 --> 34:57.929
want to be with you just
because it's convenient.

34:57.995 --> 34:59.864
And not put you as
their forefront.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.966
I mean, it's happened.

35:02.033 --> 35:04.135
Do you feel like you're
somewhat closed off

35:04.202 --> 35:05.470
because of that?

35:05.536 --> 35:08.139
Maybe, yeah.

35:08.206 --> 35:10.575
Maria's a closed off person,
I respect that.

35:10.641 --> 35:14.712
But the ability to build
that trust with her...

35:14.779 --> 35:16.214
it's, it's great.

35:16.280 --> 35:18.249
- Regardless of...
- Yeah, yeah.

35:18.316 --> 35:21.219
- ...how that ceremony went.

35:21.285 --> 35:22.553
- It's over.
- It's in the past.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.555
It is in the past.
You're here.

35:24.622 --> 35:25.423
I'm here.

35:25.490 --> 35:26.858
I want to get to know you more.
- Okay.

35:26.924 --> 35:28.793
- Okay?
- Yeah.

35:33.798 --> 35:36.701
- Hi, guys.
- Hi!

35:36.767 --> 35:38.236
We were just talking
about you guys.

35:38.302 --> 35:40.505
- What's going on?
- What a weird coincidence.

35:40.571 --> 35:41.873
Come join.

35:41.939 --> 35:43.541
You can sit on it.
We need the weight there.

35:43.608 --> 35:45.843
- How was it?
- It was actually pretty scary.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.178
We were really high up and-

35:47.245 --> 35:48.513
I don't know if you could
hear me screaming.

35:48.579 --> 35:49.747
I could, yeah.

35:49.814 --> 35:51.015
I was like, "That's Lisa".

35:51.082 --> 35:53.784
We spent the rest of the time
just in the Great Room, like,

35:53.851 --> 35:55.820
chatting on the couch
for a long time.

35:55.887 --> 35:57.088
- Shooting the breeze?
- Yeah.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.155
- I'd say it went really well.
- Getting to know each other.

35:58.222 --> 36:00.725
I definitely have to pull
Josh aside and tell him

36:00.791 --> 36:01.959
how my date with
Connor went.

36:02.026 --> 36:04.595
In the past, Josh has always
reassured me right off the bat

36:04.662 --> 36:06.531
and I can't honestly
tell him that

36:06.597 --> 36:08.065
I didn't feel
something tonight.

36:16.007 --> 36:20.111
You being here is like-
you just feel very real.

36:20.177 --> 36:21.179
I think I mentioned that
like several times.

36:21.245 --> 36:22.647
I like that.

36:22.713 --> 36:24.582
So, you're just like really
nice to be around

36:24.649 --> 36:26.184
because of that.

36:29.153 --> 36:34.192
The consensus was
that you... have...

36:36.394 --> 36:38.763
- Do you mind if I interrupt?
- You can tell me another time.

36:38.829 --> 36:40.164
Oh, Lisa,
I didn't see you there.

36:40.231 --> 36:41.599
You can tell me another time.
- This won't take long.

36:41.666 --> 36:42.867
Yeah, absolutely.

36:42.934 --> 36:46.137
So, Lisa walks up and,
I am a bit curious as to

36:46.204 --> 36:48.573
how Lisa's date has gone.

36:48.639 --> 36:51.142
I wanted to talk to you the
second I got back, but like,

36:51.208 --> 36:53.644
obviously, you weren't
at the campfire.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.346
I'll be completely honest,
the date went well.

36:55.413 --> 36:58.649
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Um...

36:58.716 --> 37:00.051
We did kiss.

37:02.086 --> 37:05.289
I feel kind of bad about it in
a way because I just feel like,

37:05.356 --> 37:06.958
you know, like,
you've explored things

37:07.024 --> 37:08.926
with a lot of other people.

37:08.993 --> 37:10.294
You've always come back
and immediately

37:10.361 --> 37:13.864
just kind of
been like, "Meh".

37:13.931 --> 37:16.133
You know, and I feel like this
might be a little bit different.

37:24.408 --> 37:26.010
I'll be completely honest,
the date went well.

37:26.077 --> 37:29.246
- Yeah, that's cool.
- Um, we did kiss.

37:29.313 --> 37:31.449
You've explored things with
a lot of other people

37:31.515 --> 37:33.985
last week when you
were The Bachelor.

37:34.051 --> 37:35.686
You've always come back
and immediately

37:35.753 --> 37:38.756
just kind of
been like, "Meh".

37:38.823 --> 37:41.292
You know, and I feel like this
might be a little bit different.

37:43.828 --> 37:45.296
I don't really know

37:45.363 --> 37:47.331
exactly what I'm feeling
right now, to be honest.

37:47.398 --> 37:49.266
When he came, I felt like,

37:49.333 --> 37:51.302
it seemed like a guy that
you would like.

37:51.369 --> 37:55.473
All I know for sure is that
I care about you a lot.

37:55.539 --> 37:56.474
Me too!

37:56.540 --> 37:58.275
Like, I really, really
care about you.

37:58.342 --> 38:00.344
We kissed and then I was like,
I feel bad.

38:00.411 --> 38:03.948
I like Josh, Josh is cool.
Josh is the nicest.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.817
Yeah, I mean, I really, really,
really, really care about you.

38:06.884 --> 38:08.486
- And like, this has been...
- "Mrrrrrr".

38:08.552 --> 38:11.422
This has been really cool.

38:11.489 --> 38:13.257
And I want you to like...

38:13.324 --> 38:17.194
if you really like someone,
Lisa, like,

38:17.261 --> 38:19.964
I want you to be able to explore
that here, honestly.

38:20.031 --> 38:22.233
Stop being so selfless.

38:22.300 --> 38:25.403
It's honestly kind of a relief
to finally sit down and have a

38:25.469 --> 38:27.972
real conversation about this
and realize like, hey,

38:28.039 --> 38:30.941
this is not gonna go anywhere
romantically so...

38:31.008 --> 38:33.411
I'm happy it is what it is
and we're friends and

38:33.477 --> 38:37.148
I hope Josh finds
his perfect girl.

38:37.214 --> 38:39.283
I'm here, like,
I'm in your corner.

38:39.350 --> 38:41.285
Whether I'm with you or I'm
cheering for you, like,

38:41.352 --> 38:42.453
I got your back.

38:42.520 --> 38:44.288
I feel the same.

38:54.832 --> 38:57.535
I think we're getting a
new camper today!

38:57.601 --> 39:00.538
- Yeah.
- Where'd you go last night?

39:00.604 --> 39:02.907
- Like...?
- After the bonfire.

39:02.973 --> 39:05.009
I had a private
conversation with Josh.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.144
Oh, you did, last night?

39:07.211 --> 39:09.213
I had to go interrupt and
then go have like a,

39:09.280 --> 39:10.181
"Oh, no,
the date went well".

39:10.247 --> 39:12.049
You did it.

39:12.116 --> 39:14.985
Oh, no!

39:15.052 --> 39:18.556
She was like, "What are you
doing over here with Maria?"

39:18.622 --> 39:20.358
I was like,
"We're just talking".

39:20.424 --> 39:22.393
- She was like teasing you?
- Yeah.

39:22.460 --> 39:23.894
Yeah, that's how it
is out here.

39:23.961 --> 39:25.863
Did she have a good
time on her date?

39:25.930 --> 39:27.264
Yeah, I think she-
I expected her to.

39:27.331 --> 39:29.033
Yeah.

39:29.100 --> 39:30.401
Maria and I have a
lot of chemistry.

39:30.468 --> 39:32.136
It's exciting,
there's mystery.

39:32.203 --> 39:33.437
She's beautiful.

39:33.504 --> 39:35.106
There's a lot of curiosity
there for me.

39:35.172 --> 39:40.344
Who is this person underneath
what we're seeing so far?

39:41.545 --> 39:43.414
Every time I think someone's
coming in I just like-

39:43.481 --> 39:44.415
I'm like every time...

39:44.482 --> 39:45.983
Me too, I can't
stop looking.

39:46.050 --> 39:47.084
What's over there,
what's over there?

39:47.151 --> 39:50.521
I think we're gonna get like a
hurricane type of...

39:50.588 --> 39:51.889
vortex personality.

39:51.956 --> 39:53.224
Another, another hurricane?

39:53.290 --> 39:54.225
I think we need it,
I think we need it.

39:54.291 --> 39:55.526
We've had Adam and "Eve".

40:06.637 --> 40:08.906
My name is Karn.
I'm 30 years old.

40:08.973 --> 40:11.175
I am an actor and I'm from
Toronto, Ontario.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.476
I'm looking for someone
I can connect with,

40:12.543 --> 40:15.146
can really talk to,
can be my true self.

40:15.212 --> 40:17.381
And walk out with potentially
something more.

40:17.448 --> 40:18.449
- Karn.
- How's it going?

40:18.516 --> 40:20.251
- What's up?
- How's it doing, man?

40:20.317 --> 40:22.086
It's going well, man.
Good to see you.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.921
- Nice to meet you.
- Yeah, welcome to Paradise.

40:23.988 --> 40:24.989
Thanks for having me.

40:25.055 --> 40:26.957
This is the date card.
How do you feel about that?

40:27.024 --> 40:30.027
I'm excited to see what
dates are gonna be like

40:30.094 --> 40:32.029
in Paradise versus
the real world.

40:32.096 --> 40:34.331
- Lead with this.
- Lead with this.

40:34.398 --> 40:37.034
Paradise, I'm here
and I'm ready.

40:39.036 --> 40:41.472
- Oh, there's a new guy.
- Oh, he looks handsome.

40:41.539 --> 40:42.940
- What's up, dude, hi.
- Hey.

40:43.007 --> 40:44.175
- Hi!
- Hey, what's good, man?

40:44.241 --> 40:45.576
- How are you?
- Karn, nice to meet you, man.

40:45.643 --> 40:46.610
Hi, I'm Maria.
It's nice to meet you.

40:46.677 --> 40:48.312
Maria?
Nice to meet you.

40:48.379 --> 40:50.481
- Hi, I'm Stacy.
- Stacy, very nice to meet you.

40:50.548 --> 40:52.116
So many names.
If I forget, I'm so sorry.

40:52.183 --> 40:53.584
Kamil, I'm gonna hug you out.
- Alright.

40:53.651 --> 40:54.652
Nice to meet you, brother.

40:54.718 --> 40:57.221
I give him a handshake and
he's the only one that

40:57.288 --> 40:59.490
gave me a hug so, it felt
kind of weird.

40:59.557 --> 41:02.026
But, I'm like, alright,
I'll take it, bro.

41:02.092 --> 41:03.661
Like, welcome to Paradise.

41:03.727 --> 41:05.896
- Welcome, Karn.
- Thank you for having me.

41:05.963 --> 41:08.465
- Have a good day today.
- We're here for a good time.

41:08.532 --> 41:11.168
I have limited time to
make this decision,

41:11.235 --> 41:14.538
so I have to get on the beach
and talk to everyone.

41:14.605 --> 41:16.974
I have an-
a butt tattoo as well.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.076
Mine's a little hear that says
"Not yours" in it.

41:19.143 --> 41:22.613
See, that's cute.
I have a monkey eating a banana.

41:22.680 --> 41:24.215
- So, you're spiritual?
- Very.

41:24.281 --> 41:26.250
- I can tell, I get the vibe.
-

41:26.317 --> 41:27.518
That's a high-five right there.
- That is a high-five.

41:27.585 --> 41:30.254
That is solid.

41:30.321 --> 41:31.555
- Hey, man.
- Hey, dude.

41:31.622 --> 41:33.490
You're super good-looking,
but I'm gonna ask-

41:33.557 --> 41:36.193
That's totally cool, man.
Absolutely, man.

41:36.260 --> 41:38.662
Right when things are
settling down a bit,

41:38.729 --> 41:39.864
we're gonna mix it up.

41:39.930 --> 41:43.033
- So, you're from Toronto?
- Yeah, originally from Wasaga.

41:43.100 --> 41:44.168
You're from Toronto?

41:44.235 --> 41:45.936
Well, I was born in
Colombia and like,

41:46.003 --> 41:48.672
I kind of go back and forth
between the two.

41:48.739 --> 41:49.874
So, how long you been here?

41:49.940 --> 41:54.144
I was the last person that
walked in, in terms of girls.

41:54.211 --> 41:57.448
I know, like, what you're
going through.

41:57.514 --> 42:00.951
Just coming in, like, as a new
person, like, it's not easy.

42:01.018 --> 42:04.054
I take Maria aside, I start
noticing a connection.

42:04.121 --> 42:07.625
And, I want to see where
I could take this.

42:07.691 --> 42:10.261
I want to go on a date with you.

42:10.327 --> 42:12.029
- I mean...
- If you're open to it.

42:12.096 --> 42:14.398
- Yeah, absolutely, it'd be fun.
- "Let's make some waves."

42:16.100 --> 42:18.135
- Bye, guys.
- Ciao.

42:18.202 --> 42:20.104
Oh! So, it's Maria's
getting taken?

42:20.170 --> 42:21.238
Maria's getting taken.

42:21.305 --> 42:22.539
I'm gonna go
"make some waves".

42:22.606 --> 42:24.608
You grab that drink
for Maria, boy?

42:24.675 --> 42:26.410
- I was going to.
- Agh!

42:26.477 --> 42:29.980
Now it's for me.

42:30.047 --> 42:32.583
I'm so excited.
Thanks for picking me.

42:32.650 --> 42:34.084
Absolutely.

42:34.151 --> 42:36.086
Oh, sick.

42:36.153 --> 42:38.188
Oh, cool. Oh...

42:38.255 --> 42:40.658
- You ever been tubing?
- Nope.

42:40.724 --> 42:42.326
You gotta hold on tight though.
It's gonna be serious.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.561
It's gonna be fun.

42:44.628 --> 42:48.098
Holy [beep]!
Keep it coming, man!

42:48.165 --> 42:50.634
- You ready, hold on!
- Okay, this is fun.

42:50.701 --> 42:52.336
Here we go, here we go,
here we go, here we go!

42:52.403 --> 42:54.004
Woohoo!

42:54.071 --> 42:56.574
Hold on!

42:58.342 --> 42:59.610
Ow.

42:59.677 --> 43:02.279
- You good?
- Ow.

43:02.346 --> 43:03.614
They're going on a boat?!

43:03.681 --> 43:05.215
Yeah, you should've
tried harder.

43:09.186 --> 43:10.788
So, how did you
get into acting?

43:10.854 --> 43:13.590
I loved theatre, so I did
theatre in elementary school.

43:13.657 --> 43:16.293
Obviously, I played Aladdin.
The only brown kid in my school.

43:16.360 --> 43:19.096
Yeah, I'd probably
be like the Jasmine.

43:19.163 --> 43:20.130
You're creative too, no?

43:20.197 --> 43:21.432
Yeah, I'm a
fashion designer.

43:21.498 --> 43:23.634
Whoa!

43:23.701 --> 43:26.403
Look, he's trying to put-

43:30.741 --> 43:35.079
Holy shit!

43:37.715 --> 43:40.584
I've never face planted
on a date before.

43:40.651 --> 43:42.820
Truly.

43:46.323 --> 43:47.524
I wish we could get
a better angle of

43:47.591 --> 43:48.792
what's going on on the tube.

43:48.859 --> 43:51.061
I'm sure there's a couple
smooches going on.

43:51.128 --> 43:54.264
Yeah. That would be a
good time to do it.

43:54.331 --> 43:56.066
I'm definitely wondering
how the date is going.

43:56.133 --> 43:58.402
I mean, Maria has a
spare rose this week.

43:58.469 --> 44:01.472
I think right now that
all depends on...

44:01.538 --> 44:02.806
who between Karn and I,

44:02.873 --> 44:07.444
Maria's really interested
in keeping here.

44:07.511 --> 44:09.146
This is nice.

44:09.213 --> 44:10.280
So, you have a good time?

44:10.347 --> 44:12.316
I did!
I had a great time.

44:12.383 --> 44:14.618
I really enjoy, like,
this type of thing.

44:14.685 --> 44:16.553
I like, like feeling a
little bit scared.

44:16.620 --> 44:17.788
Adrenaline!

44:17.855 --> 44:20.157
You're very easy to talk to,
which is nice.

44:20.224 --> 44:24.261
Like you don't always find that
here or out, like, outside.

44:24.328 --> 44:26.263
- What do you like?
- Ooh...

44:26.330 --> 44:28.799
Sense of humour, doesn't take
themselves too seriously.

44:28.866 --> 44:30.634
And then,
it would also be like,

44:30.701 --> 44:33.537
how close are they with
their family and friends,

44:33.604 --> 44:34.638
you know what I mean?
Like, is that-

44:34.705 --> 44:36.206
So, that's really
important to you?

44:36.273 --> 44:38.308
Yeah, absolutely.
My mom's my best friend.

44:38.375 --> 44:40.277
I talk to her about everything.
- That's really nice.

44:40.344 --> 44:42.112
I love that woman,
I FaceTime her every day.

44:42.179 --> 44:43.881
I really like that he
loves his mother,

44:43.947 --> 44:45.382
that he's close
to his family.

44:45.449 --> 44:46.684
That's a sign of like a,

44:46.750 --> 44:48.852
someone that was
brought up really well.

44:48.919 --> 44:51.455
Do your parents expect you
to be with somebody

44:51.522 --> 44:53.157
who's from Colombia
or Colombian?

44:53.223 --> 44:55.292
No, no, like, my parents are
super open about that.

44:55.359 --> 44:58.128
I've met some people who, like,
they can't tell their parents.

44:58.195 --> 44:59.563
Really?
That's very sad.

44:59.630 --> 45:00.664
It's sad.
It takes time though.

45:00.731 --> 45:03.367
It's like, you gotta slowly
take off the band-aids,

45:03.434 --> 45:04.802
not like right away, so...

45:04.868 --> 45:06.537
I get it, I've been in
that situation

45:06.603 --> 45:08.739
when I first started,
like, dating.

45:08.806 --> 45:10.407
I was a little uncomfortable.

45:10.474 --> 45:12.843
Maybe it was more of a
personal thing, my insecurity.

45:12.910 --> 45:15.546
But eventually, you just say,
forget it and you just-

45:15.612 --> 45:16.780
Just go for whoever you want.

45:16.847 --> 45:18.549
Be your true self,
tell them whatever.

45:18.615 --> 45:19.583
It is what it is and...

45:19.650 --> 45:21.485
That's how it should be.

45:21.552 --> 45:24.254
I'm hoping I get the opportunity
to talk to Maria more.

45:24.321 --> 45:26.557
She checks, checks a lot
of the boxes off.

45:35.599 --> 45:37.334
Babe, we're coming up to
the end of Paradise.

45:37.401 --> 45:39.536
Things are so perfect here
and I'm just like,

45:39.603 --> 45:41.538
every time I always thought
something was going

45:41.605 --> 45:43.907
so perfect in my life,
something happened.

45:43.974 --> 45:46.310
You can be terrified.

45:46.376 --> 45:48.879
And, I'll be calm.

45:48.946 --> 45:53.817
I cannot believe the guy in the
pink Speedo is this amazing.

45:53.884 --> 45:55.385
I'm so excited,
like, I'm actually

45:55.452 --> 45:57.855
on cloud nine, every day.

45:57.921 --> 46:01.325
I am falling in love
with Joey, I am.

46:01.391 --> 46:03.360
I spent the last 7 years
waiting to meet you.

46:03.427 --> 46:05.229
I will spend the next 7

46:05.295 --> 46:07.764
going through bullshit
just to be with you.

46:07.831 --> 46:10.334
- Bullshit. Love and bullshit.
- Love and bullshit.

46:10.400 --> 46:11.935
At the end of the day,

46:12.002 --> 46:14.271
you're my girl and that's
all I care about.

46:14.338 --> 46:16.240
Okay, just don't run away.

46:17.708 --> 46:20.377
What's that?

46:20.444 --> 46:23.380
Mikey, look what I found.

46:23.447 --> 46:24.915
- Is that a date card?
- Yeah.

46:26.416 --> 46:28.285
- Let's go.
- We got a date card!

46:28.352 --> 46:30.687
- Did they get a date card?
- Agh!

46:30.754 --> 46:32.322
Who do you think's
gonna get it?

46:32.389 --> 46:34.591
Stace and Mike, Kit and Alex.
I don't know.

46:34.658 --> 46:35.692
That could be true, too.

46:35.759 --> 46:38.462
Kevin has a date card.

46:38.529 --> 46:40.230
Probably not for me.

46:44.468 --> 46:45.569
Joey.

46:45.636 --> 46:47.371
Do I get a date card?!

46:47.437 --> 46:50.440
"Make your date the
happiest camper".

46:50.507 --> 46:52.676
Would you like to be
a happy camper?

46:52.743 --> 46:54.444
Yeah, you would!

46:54.511 --> 46:56.380
Woohoo!
We got a date!

46:58.982 --> 47:01.485
- We got a

47:01.552 --> 47:03.754
This is gonna be a fun date.
This is an important date.

47:03.820 --> 47:05.856
I've been wanting to ask
Vay something and,

47:05.923 --> 47:07.691
I wasn't sure how it was
gonna happen.

47:07.758 --> 47:10.794
But now I got a date card.
I'm excited because this date

47:10.861 --> 47:12.763
will give me the
proper scenario and

47:12.829 --> 47:14.565
opportunity to ask her.

47:34.918 --> 47:36.386
Get the out of here.
Is she wearing a cowboy hat?

47:38.155 --> 47:40.090
I'm gonna need a minute.

47:40.157 --> 47:43.760
She is a cowboy's
dream right now.

47:43.827 --> 47:48.465
It's making me happy in a
bunch of places.

47:48.532 --> 47:50.000
Holy [beep]!
Uh-huh.

47:50.067 --> 47:53.570
How are you?

47:53.637 --> 47:56.039
This is a cute outfit.
I really, really liked it.

47:56.106 --> 47:58.508
But don't tell him. ́Cause
he's gonna make me

47:58.575 --> 47:59.977
dress up like
this every day.

48:00.043 --> 48:01.645
- Wow.
- Wow.

48:01.712 --> 48:02.880
Wow.

48:02.946 --> 48:04.781
The fact that she even
thought about

48:04.848 --> 48:08.018
doing that for me is just...

48:08.085 --> 48:12.022
the sweetest, most adorable
thing ever.

48:12.089 --> 48:13.557
Check out my camper,
you wanna see this?

48:13.624 --> 48:15.425
Look it, we're the
happiest camper.

48:15.492 --> 48:18.795
Ah! Oh, that's cute.

48:18.862 --> 48:20.597
Are you excited for your
first date in Paradise?

48:20.664 --> 48:21.932
Are you kidding me?
When it looks like that,

48:21.999 --> 48:24.701
and it looks like this.
Surely I am.

48:24.768 --> 48:26.837
You look so cute.
We match.

48:26.903 --> 48:27.971
Of course, we do.

48:28.038 --> 48:29.740
He's all mine
for the evening.

48:29.806 --> 48:32.843
I don't have to share him.
Sorry, Brendan M.,

48:32.909 --> 48:34.511
he's mine for tonight.

48:35.746 --> 48:37.014
- Oh.
- Pop!

48:37.080 --> 48:39.883
You ever roast a dog before?

48:39.950 --> 48:41.952
Now, this is kind of like
open heart surgery.

48:42.019 --> 48:43.186
Boom, off to the races.

48:43.253 --> 48:45.789
Wait, I want it to like split
so it curls its little legs

48:45.856 --> 48:47.524
and like makes a spider.

48:47.591 --> 48:49.893
That is just the
strangest thing.

48:49.960 --> 48:51.828
Whatever she wants, I
will cut that thing in

48:51.895 --> 48:54.564
12 different pieces and roast
it on 12 different sticks

48:54.631 --> 48:56.833
if that's what she wants.

48:56.900 --> 48:59.836
My spider dog is amazing.

48:59.903 --> 49:01.672
He didn't even know
how to do it.

49:01.738 --> 49:03.840
I mean, it looked more
like a crab but,

49:03.907 --> 49:05.108
I thought it was pretty cute.

49:05.175 --> 49:06.543
Not a spider, but...

49:06.610 --> 49:08.679
Well, that's because you
cut the legs wrong.

49:15.686 --> 49:17.020
Joey got his date.

49:17.087 --> 49:19.122
"I'm making her
a happy camper".

49:19.189 --> 49:20.490
I don't know what that
could be about.

49:20.557 --> 49:22.459
Like s'mores or...

49:22.526 --> 49:23.994
- I don't, I can't-
- That would be our happy.

49:26.096 --> 49:28.098
I love that he's recognizing
like, damn, like,

49:28.165 --> 49:30.867
this is my girl, like, and
he's not afraid to like

49:30.934 --> 49:33.503
go for what he wants.
I think that's awesome.

49:33.570 --> 49:35.472
I know Joey has some,

49:35.539 --> 49:37.941
there's something he
has to tell her so...

49:38.008 --> 49:39.209
- Oh...
- What does that mean?

49:39.276 --> 49:41.478
- Like, bad or good?
- Yeah... good?

49:41.545 --> 49:43.447
I mean, I mean...
I would assume good.

49:43.513 --> 49:44.981
I mean, what comes after love?

49:45.048 --> 49:48.018
Moving in?
Moving...

49:48.085 --> 49:50.754
- To Toronto.
- I don't know, I don't know.

49:50.821 --> 49:52.089
- Babies?
- I have no idea.

49:52.155 --> 49:53.190
- Is she pregnant?
-

49:53.256 --> 49:55.492
"You're pregnant."

49:59.763 --> 50:01.231
Who would've ever thought
the guy walking in with

50:01.298 --> 50:04.801
the pink Speedo would be
this amazing man?

50:04.868 --> 50:06.503
You surprise me every day.

50:06.570 --> 50:07.871
I'm gonna run out
material soon.

50:07.938 --> 50:09.106
I don't know, and then
you're just gonna be like,

50:09.172 --> 50:10.607
God, wow.

50:10.674 --> 50:15.012
Camper, fire,
roasting dogs and ́mallows.

50:15.078 --> 50:16.580
Oh, yeah, there we go.

50:16.646 --> 50:18.248
I was supposed to make her
the happiest camper,

50:18.315 --> 50:20.751
but let me tell ya what, I am a
happy camper right now.

50:24.254 --> 50:25.555
I'm sorry, one more time.

50:28.191 --> 50:32.095
This date is so Joey and Vay.
I mean, he's just like...

50:32.162 --> 50:33.764
you know, being silly.

50:33.830 --> 50:36.166
I think any date would be Joey
and Vay because like,

50:36.233 --> 50:39.536
I feel like anything we do,
we just have fun.

50:39.603 --> 50:42.939
Okay, so, who in your family's
gonna like me the most?

50:43.006 --> 50:45.609
- Don't hold back.
- My dad's gonna love you.

50:45.675 --> 50:47.244
- Is he?
- Oh, my God.

50:47.310 --> 50:49.279
That's probably the best thing
you could have ever said to me.

50:49.346 --> 50:51.581
- Awesome.
- You're like his dream.

50:51.648 --> 50:53.283
I grew up with the man
in my life that just

50:53.350 --> 50:55.552
has the answer to
everything.

50:55.619 --> 50:57.554
No pressure, Joey, just keep
coming up with answers.

50:57.621 --> 50:58.522
And he's super funny,

50:58.588 --> 51:01.091
hence why I need a man
that makes me laugh.

51:01.158 --> 51:03.193
I put my parents through a lot.

51:03.260 --> 51:07.597
And I promised myself that the
next man I bring home,

51:07.664 --> 51:11.568
is most likely gonna be
the man I marry so...

51:11.635 --> 51:14.070
I really hope you get
to meet them.

51:14.137 --> 51:16.039
I've got something big
to tell Vay tonight,

51:16.106 --> 51:20.610
and the anticipation is...

51:20.677 --> 51:24.214
underneath everything I'm
saying to her right now.

51:24.281 --> 51:28.218
I'm trying my best to keep my
composure and just be normal.

51:28.285 --> 51:31.922
Um...

51:31.988 --> 51:33.723
It's a lot.

51:33.790 --> 51:36.793
I'm surrounded, surrounded
by happy marriages.

51:36.860 --> 51:38.061
Like, my parents
are still married.

51:38.128 --> 51:39.996
My sister's been happily
married for a while.

51:40.063 --> 51:42.899
My grandparents were
married for so long and...

51:42.966 --> 51:44.167
You know, I just want to
follow in their footsteps,

51:44.234 --> 51:46.203
and I think that's why I don't
want to settle because, like,

51:46.269 --> 51:48.772
if I ever get married, it's...

51:48.839 --> 51:51.641
I want to make it to the end.

51:51.708 --> 51:54.177
I think that...

51:54.244 --> 51:55.712
this is definitely the girl
I could spend

51:55.779 --> 51:57.714
the rest of my life with.

51:57.781 --> 51:59.716
Like, what are you
scared of about us

51:59.783 --> 52:01.685
going outside of Paradise?

52:01.751 --> 52:03.753
We both come from
different worlds.

52:03.820 --> 52:09.659
I just hope that we can like
mesh the two together.

52:09.726 --> 52:11.895
That's the best part for me.

52:11.962 --> 52:15.799
I've wanted this my entire life
and I'm just like...

52:15.866 --> 52:19.636
just worried it just
won't work out.

52:19.703 --> 52:23.306
But, I mean, I also found you
in like the craziest way

52:23.373 --> 52:25.976
possible so like, I feel like
the universe wants us together.

52:26.042 --> 52:29.679
I told you, I got you.

52:29.746 --> 52:31.281
- Promise?
- Promise.

52:31.348 --> 52:34.317
We're halfway through
this date and,

52:34.384 --> 52:37.153
all the nerves I forgot...

52:37.220 --> 52:41.324
have started to
come back up. And...

52:41.391 --> 52:43.827
I know I'm getting closer and
closer to the point where

52:43.894 --> 52:46.029
I need to ask her what
I'm gonna ask her.

52:46.096 --> 52:48.231
I hope she says "yes".

52:48.298 --> 52:50.166
I do want you to meet my family.

52:50.233 --> 52:51.301
I want to, too.

52:51.368 --> 52:53.170
Um...

52:53.236 --> 52:57.274
And, speaking of which...

52:57.340 --> 52:59.609
Um, so...

53:09.252 --> 53:12.322
I've got something big
to tell Vay tonight.

53:12.389 --> 53:16.092
I'm trying my best to keep my
composure and just be normal.

53:16.159 --> 53:18.895
I'm surrounded, surrounded by
happy marriages.

53:18.962 --> 53:20.163
Like, my parents
are still married.

53:20.230 --> 53:22.199
My sister's been happily
married for a while.

53:22.265 --> 53:25.001
My grandparents were
married for so long and...

53:25.068 --> 53:26.803
You know, I just want to
follow in their footsteps.

53:26.870 --> 53:29.005
I know I'm getting closer and
closer to the point where

53:29.072 --> 53:32.108
I need to ask her what
I'm gonna ask her.

53:32.175 --> 53:33.843
I hope she says "yes".

53:33.910 --> 53:35.946
I do want you to meet my family.

53:36.012 --> 53:37.180
I want to, too.

53:37.247 --> 53:39.182
Um...

53:39.249 --> 53:43.486
And, speaking of which...

53:43.553 --> 53:46.056
Um, so...

53:46.122 --> 53:49.726
I had a best friend of mine
reach out to production and

53:49.793 --> 53:51.428
let me know that he's
getting married.

53:51.494 --> 53:52.762
Okay.

53:52.829 --> 53:54.297
And...

53:54.364 --> 53:56.499
I'm the best man.

53:56.566 --> 53:59.836
And I can't go...

53:59.903 --> 54:03.206
without the person in
my life now who

54:03.273 --> 54:05.375
is becoming a very
big part of my life.

54:05.442 --> 54:06.876
When are they getting married?

54:06.943 --> 54:08.378
Like, we gotta leave tonight.

54:08.445 --> 54:10.313
What?

54:10.380 --> 54:12.849
Will you be my plus one?

54:12.916 --> 54:14.851
What?!

54:14.918 --> 54:17.187
Do you want to go
meet the family?

54:17.253 --> 54:19.089
Of course,
I'll come with you.

54:19.155 --> 54:20.357
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:20.423 --> 54:22.459
yeah, you will!

54:24.260 --> 54:27.163
Wow, am I happy that she
accepted my invitation.

54:27.230 --> 54:32.836
I was so scared for a second.
Vay is coming to Alberta.

54:32.902 --> 54:38.041
This is why I love her 'cause I
know she is just gonna fit in...

54:38.108 --> 54:40.110
without trying.

54:40.176 --> 54:42.479
You might want to
bring those boots.

54:42.545 --> 54:44.080
I...

54:50.053 --> 54:51.254
Alright.

54:51.321 --> 54:52.222
Should we go tell everyone?

54:52.289 --> 54:53.456
I think you're gonna
have to tell everyone

54:53.523 --> 54:55.425
́cause I'm in shock.

55:01.598 --> 55:02.966
Everyone's really
great here.

55:03.033 --> 55:04.234
It's a good energy,
it's a good vibe.

55:04.300 --> 55:06.202
I love it.
I was a little nervous.

55:06.269 --> 55:08.104
I like being on this side,
for once.

55:08.171 --> 55:10.173
Yeah, man, that would
be very relaxing.

55:10.240 --> 55:11.408
- It's not bad.
-

55:11.474 --> 55:13.910
So, what, what's your
situation like?

55:13.977 --> 55:15.445
I've been hanging out with
Maria for the last couple days.

55:15.512 --> 55:17.080
- How's that going?
- It's good, man.

55:17.147 --> 55:17.881
- It's good?
- Yeah, she's-

55:17.947 --> 55:19.315
I mean, you met her,
she's cool.

55:19.382 --> 55:20.950
I know Maria's
interested in Josh,

55:21.017 --> 55:24.220
but he's not really
competition, no.

55:24.287 --> 55:25.388
You took her on the date,
didn't you?

55:25.455 --> 55:26.389
- I did.
- How was that?

55:26.456 --> 55:28.892
Fantastic.
It was a good time.

55:28.958 --> 55:30.360
You guys went tubing.
Did you get thrown off?

55:30.427 --> 55:31.928
She was like-

55:31.995 --> 55:32.862
And I was like, "You gotta
lean to the left,

55:32.929 --> 55:34.931
you're gonna fly!"
But she had a good time.

55:34.998 --> 55:37.367
She was like,
"This is a good date!"

55:37.434 --> 55:39.235
Yeah.

55:39.302 --> 55:41.237
I wanted to hear
about your date.

55:41.304 --> 55:43.373
- What did you guys do?
- We went tubing.

55:43.440 --> 55:46.342
Then we like sat down,
had some sangria.

55:46.409 --> 55:48.278
And chatted a little bit,
it was nice.

55:48.344 --> 55:50.180
How'd you, like,
what do you think?

55:50.246 --> 55:54.617
He was really nice, like, he is
very like family oriented.

55:54.684 --> 55:57.253
He's super sweet,
very confident.

55:57.320 --> 55:59.923
How do you feel like things
are going with Josh?

55:59.989 --> 56:01.391
We actually have a
lot in common.

56:01.458 --> 56:02.992
Yeah.

56:03.059 --> 56:04.994
Like, I do like Josh,
obviously,

56:05.061 --> 56:06.963
but I'm attracted to
other people too.

56:07.030 --> 56:09.099
So, it's a tough
decision for me.

56:12.068 --> 56:14.371
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers, cheers, cheers!

56:16.539 --> 56:17.941
You guys got your drinks, yeah?

56:18.007 --> 56:19.576
- Thanks, man.
- Okay.

56:19.642 --> 56:21.411
Okay, you haven't seen all
the spots yet, so-

56:21.478 --> 56:22.912
Are you gonna show me
all the spots?

56:22.979 --> 56:25.482
Is it bringing back
good memories?

56:25.548 --> 56:29.519
I'm not sure.
Can I make it past this spot?

56:29.586 --> 56:32.021
So, like, if you want to get to
know me, like, that's on you.

56:32.088 --> 56:33.590
If you don't, then like,
it's fine.

56:33.656 --> 56:35.158
Obviously, I do.

56:35.225 --> 56:36.526
Oh, my God, I made it.

56:36.593 --> 56:37.627
See, look what you
missed out on.

56:37.694 --> 56:39.896
This could've been really nice.
- This is beautiful.

56:39.963 --> 56:41.965
Maria does not
forgive and forget.

56:42.031 --> 56:43.500
I'm sorry if I'm taking you
away from Karn.

56:43.566 --> 56:44.734
I know you guys
went on a date today.

56:44.801 --> 56:49.405
Like, we had a really good time.
I face planted in the water.

56:49.472 --> 56:52.041
He's really, really nice.
Like, he's super nice.

56:52.108 --> 56:54.611
Yeah, he is.

56:54.677 --> 56:57.547
Are you into her, I guess,
most importantly?

56:57.614 --> 57:00.984
I think she's a great human.
She's very kind, very...

57:01.050 --> 57:03.119
Family oriented, very cute.

57:03.186 --> 57:05.121
Guys like you and me though,
we don't have that much time

57:05.188 --> 57:07.924
so you kind of gotta make the
questions count though, no?

57:07.991 --> 57:09.659
Dude, you take as much
time as you want.

57:09.726 --> 57:12.362
You know why?
́Cause you're on Paradise.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.264
- Yeah.
- Hey, what's your name?

57:14.330 --> 57:16.166
- Time goes by quick.
- What's your name?

57:16.232 --> 57:17.167
- Me?
- Yeah. Connor?

57:17.233 --> 57:18.168
- Connor.
- Nice to meet you.

57:18.234 --> 57:19.469
- How old are you?
- 27.

57:19.536 --> 57:20.703
Oh, my God,
that's so interesting.

57:20.770 --> 57:23.373
He's just like, "What, what's
your, what are you feeling?

57:23.440 --> 57:26.676
When's your birthday?"
"Oh, you're an Aries, like...

57:26.743 --> 57:30.180
that's, that's cool because
Aries get along with

57:30.246 --> 57:34.584
guys like me." And he starts
talking to like Lisa.

57:34.651 --> 57:37.520
I might be in trouble 'cause
I'm not a great talker, like...

57:37.587 --> 57:41.057
I mess up my words like every
other sentence, so like,

57:41.124 --> 57:42.959
he's smooth and I'm like
opposite of smooth.

57:43.026 --> 57:45.028
I'm like brutal.

57:47.564 --> 57:49.499
It seems like you're having
a good time now. It seems...

57:49.566 --> 57:51.234
Oh, my God, yeah,
totally different.

57:51.301 --> 57:52.702
Gotten a lot better than
it felt before.

57:52.769 --> 57:54.304
I've gone from like
here to here.

57:54.370 --> 57:57.607
- In like two days.
- I had a similar experience.

57:57.674 --> 58:00.109
It's been
extremely humbling.

58:00.176 --> 58:02.078
I feel like it's taught me a
lot about myself in the

58:02.145 --> 58:05.014
sense that like,
I don't know, like,

58:05.081 --> 58:08.084
some people are attracted
to looks right away.

58:08.151 --> 58:10.587
It's cool when like someone
like actually gets to know you.

58:10.653 --> 58:12.021
Like, for who you are.

58:12.088 --> 58:14.524
Because you share like
some level of values.

58:14.591 --> 58:15.558
Yeah.

58:15.625 --> 58:17.594
Yeah, those things
are important.

58:17.660 --> 58:20.663
I like that you got to like
marches and, actually like,

58:20.730 --> 58:24.000
I don't know like, try to do
something to like-

58:24.067 --> 58:25.435
Yeah, well,
I'm really into that.

58:25.501 --> 58:27.103
Make a positive impact
in the world.

58:27.170 --> 58:28.338
You're a conscious person.

58:28.404 --> 58:32.108
I love that have like these
morals that you, you stick by.

58:32.175 --> 58:33.376
Yeah.

58:33.443 --> 58:34.444
I want to kiss Maria.

58:34.510 --> 58:36.346
It just gets hard to not
want to kiss the girl that

58:36.412 --> 58:37.580
you're spending a
lot of time with.

58:37.647 --> 58:39.048
I think you're beautiful and

58:39.115 --> 58:41.150
I really enjoy spending
time with you.

58:41.217 --> 58:42.619
So, I feel drawn to you.

58:42.685 --> 58:45.455
I think I want to kiss you
before we do.

58:45.521 --> 58:48.324
Can I do that?

58:48.391 --> 58:49.659
Ah...

58:49.726 --> 58:52.195
it's just like, yeah,
and literally you just

58:52.262 --> 58:54.264
kissed someone like
the night before.

58:55.665 --> 58:57.634
- It's really hard for me.
- Two nights before.

58:57.700 --> 59:01.638
It's really hard for me to like
take that out of my... head.

59:01.704 --> 59:02.705
Throughout his time here,

59:02.772 --> 59:05.608
he has kissed quite
a few girls.

59:05.675 --> 59:09.245
And I don't want to
be the 4th girl.

59:09.312 --> 59:11.814
I've already felt like a
second choice, like,

59:11.881 --> 59:14.183
quite a few times here.

59:14.250 --> 59:15.752
Um...

59:17.854 --> 59:20.056
I don't normally get
rejected a lot.

59:20.123 --> 59:21.624
I definitely feel humbled.

59:34.570 --> 59:37.774
I, like, push things away
when they feel really good

59:37.840 --> 59:39.475
because I get afraid.

59:39.542 --> 59:40.777
And so, that's something
that I'm,

59:40.843 --> 59:43.279
I'm battling with through
this experience.

59:43.346 --> 59:45.181
I just want to make sure like,
you know,

59:45.248 --> 59:47.450
we trust each other
moving into the real world.

59:47.517 --> 59:50.286
We have a good understanding of
like, things might be tough,

59:50.353 --> 59:52.889
but the effort will be there
on both sides.

59:52.956 --> 59:55.792
If we could leave tomorrow,
I'd leave tomorrow with you.

59:55.858 --> 59:58.394
It would, you know, that's...

1:00:00.563 --> 1:00:04.133
No one has ever looked at me
the way that you look at me.

1:00:04.200 --> 1:00:08.304
Not only do I see how much you
care for me, but I feel it.

1:00:08.371 --> 1:00:12.842
And I can feel it even
in just a glance.

1:00:12.909 --> 1:00:15.678
I love you.

1:00:15.745 --> 1:00:17.680
I do.

1:00:17.747 --> 1:00:21.451
I've been waiting for a couple
days to say that, so...

1:00:21.517 --> 1:00:24.320
I know you do.

1:00:24.387 --> 1:00:27.523
And I love you too.

1:00:27.590 --> 1:00:30.460
Hearing Illeana say those words
back to me feels great.

1:00:30.526 --> 1:00:32.528
It could end with that
engagement.

1:00:32.595 --> 1:00:33.663
I packed a nice tux.

1:00:33.730 --> 1:00:36.199
I know she packed an
engagement dress.

1:00:36.265 --> 1:00:37.900
- You love me.
- You love me.

1:00:37.967 --> 1:00:40.236
Ha-ha-ha!

1:00:45.341 --> 1:00:48.311
This made me realize like, wow,
this is getting very real.

1:00:48.378 --> 1:00:51.447
In a matter of days,
it will just be us two

1:00:51.514 --> 1:00:53.616
in the real world.

1:00:53.683 --> 1:00:55.284
It's a bit scary because I
feel like I went from

1:00:55.351 --> 1:00:57.920
zero to 100 really quick.

1:00:57.987 --> 1:01:00.690
It's only scary if it
doesn't feel right.

1:01:06.729 --> 1:01:07.830
I feel like things would
have been different

1:01:07.897 --> 1:01:10.333
if you came in earlier.

1:01:10.400 --> 1:01:12.835
Do you think you still
would've been into me?

1:01:12.902 --> 1:01:14.270
Yeah, I would have
been into you.

1:01:14.337 --> 1:01:15.571
Would you still have
been into me

1:01:15.638 --> 1:01:17.473
if you were in
here weeks ago?

1:01:17.540 --> 1:01:18.908
I'm glad you're here,
honestly. I don't know

1:01:18.975 --> 1:01:21.511
what I would've done if say,
like, you were gone or-

1:01:21.577 --> 1:01:23.212
Yeah, if I went home
last ceremony.

1:01:23.279 --> 1:01:24.781
́Cause I genuinely thought
about leaving like

1:01:24.847 --> 1:01:26.616
so many times at
the beginning.

1:01:26.682 --> 1:01:28.684
- I had a really rough week.
- Yeah.

1:01:28.751 --> 1:01:32.622
My journey here has been a
totally crazy rollercoaster ride

1:01:32.688 --> 1:01:34.357
from crying at the beach
every day to

1:01:34.424 --> 1:01:35.958
running around with
no connections.

1:01:36.025 --> 1:01:37.960
To meeting Josh,
to figuring that out.

1:01:38.027 --> 1:01:39.462
To, to...

1:01:39.529 --> 1:01:40.997
to meeting Connor and like,
I'm super happy with

1:01:41.064 --> 1:01:42.699
where I am in Paradise now.

1:01:42.765 --> 1:01:45.768
For me right now, it's like
total tunnel vision for you.

1:01:45.835 --> 1:01:48.271
Like I do want to see
where this goes.

1:01:48.337 --> 1:01:49.806
Oh, my God.

1:01:52.675 --> 1:01:55.645
- I like you.
- I like you too.

1:01:59.515 --> 1:02:00.783
I'm lucky to get to know her.

1:02:00.850 --> 1:02:02.452
Like, she's such an
awesome human.

1:02:02.518 --> 1:02:05.421
Like, from what she does for
a living to like taking in

1:02:05.488 --> 1:02:07.690
squirrels as like-
yeah, that's Lisa.

1:02:11.094 --> 1:02:12.995
So...

1:02:13.062 --> 1:02:14.597
Some stuff happened tonight.

1:02:14.664 --> 1:02:15.798
Mm!

1:02:15.865 --> 1:02:17.600
My best friend's
getting married.

1:02:17.667 --> 1:02:19.535
I gotta be the best man
in the wedding.

1:02:19.602 --> 1:02:22.905
And, I need my best girl
there with me and...

1:02:22.972 --> 1:02:24.507
Vay and I are leaving Paradise.

1:02:24.574 --> 1:02:25.675
- What?
- What?

1:02:25.742 --> 1:02:27.410
- Shut up.
- What?

1:02:27.477 --> 1:02:29.479
No, you're not, actually,
you're not!

1:02:29.545 --> 1:02:31.814
I asked Vay and she said yes
to come with me!

1:02:31.881 --> 1:02:34.984
- And she's coming to Alberta!
- No!

1:02:35.051 --> 1:02:37.787
Come here.
I love you so much.

1:02:37.854 --> 1:02:39.021
Man!

1:02:39.088 --> 1:02:39.956
It's been a
pleasure, big guy.

1:02:40.022 --> 1:02:42.492
- Yeah, it's been real.
- Has it ever, eh?

1:02:42.558 --> 1:02:43.893
Buddy, how am I
gonna forget you?

1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:45.995
Can't this wedding wait?

1:02:46.062 --> 1:02:51.400
I am 100% a forever
changed person

1:02:51.467 --> 1:02:53.636
because of Paradise.

1:02:53.703 --> 1:02:56.439
I really am. Right before
coming into Paradise,

1:02:56.506 --> 1:02:58.074
I was really giving up on love.

1:02:58.141 --> 1:03:02.044
But, I decided to give it one
more shot and I am so happy

1:03:02.111 --> 1:03:07.049
I did because I found exactly
what I was always looking for.

1:03:07.116 --> 1:03:09.952
Guys, Paradise works,
it really does.

1:03:10.019 --> 1:03:12.054
Aw!

1:03:12.121 --> 1:03:15.057
- Ah, buddy!
- Man!

1:03:15.124 --> 1:03:17.927
I am gonna miss my guy,
Brendan M.

1:03:17.994 --> 1:03:20.630
He is gonna be a part of my
life for a very long time.

1:03:20.696 --> 1:03:21.864
- I love you, buddy.
- I'm gonna miss you, brother.

1:03:21.931 --> 1:03:23.499
I love you, man.

1:03:23.566 --> 1:03:26.435
I love that guy.

1:03:26.502 --> 1:03:27.670
- My guy.
- Yes, sir.

1:03:27.737 --> 1:03:29.572
- I love you, bro.
- Love you guys all.

1:03:29.639 --> 1:03:33.409
This has been a pleasure.

1:03:33.476 --> 1:03:37.480
That's a wrap.
That's a wrap on Joey.

1:03:37.547 --> 1:03:39.515
Where's my girl at?

1:03:39.582 --> 1:03:41.584
I think round of applause
for Joey and Vay.

1:03:41.651 --> 1:03:43.085
- Come on!
- Yeah!

1:03:50.059 --> 1:03:53.362
<i>Next time, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada.</i>

1:03:53.429 --> 1:03:55.598
I think tensions are high
because we're going into the

1:03:55.665 --> 1:03:57.800
last rose ceremony,
and it really feels like

1:03:57.867 --> 1:03:59.368
things are coming
to the end.

1:03:59.435 --> 1:04:00.703
Anything important to
talk about?

1:04:00.770 --> 1:04:01.737
A lot of things to chat about.

1:04:01.804 --> 1:04:04.941
Am I gonna push it or am I
going to back away?

1:04:05.007 --> 1:04:07.743
Better be on the same page
about things and

1:04:07.810 --> 1:04:09.378
not save it for
the last minute.

1:04:09.445 --> 1:04:12.949
My experience ending Paradise
last year wasn't great.

1:04:13.015 --> 1:04:15.151
And I would love not to go
through that again.

1:04:15.218 --> 1:04:16.652
We can just leave right now.

1:04:16.719 --> 1:04:18.888
Like, where is this
all coming from?

1:04:18.955 --> 1:04:20.423
Now that the end
is nearing like,

1:04:20.489 --> 1:04:22.458
my head is just running a
million miles a minute.

1:04:22.525 --> 1:04:23.826
Feelings escalate quickly.

1:04:23.893 --> 1:04:26.963
But right now, it just seems
like a very scary jump.

1:04:27.029 --> 1:04:30.633
Logic definitely needs
to come into play.

1:04:30.700 --> 1:04:32.168
I know Maria's
interested in Josh.

1:04:32.235 --> 1:04:34.704
I have to step up my
game a little bit.

1:04:34.770 --> 1:04:35.972
Can I steal you away?

1:04:36.038 --> 1:04:38.708
I know he set up this
nice date, but frankly,

1:04:38.774 --> 1:04:40.009
I don't give a shit.

1:04:40.076 --> 1:04:41.711
I'm going in there,
I'm breaking this up,

1:04:41.777 --> 1:04:43.679
I'm taking my lady.

1:04:43.746 --> 1:04:46.115
At the end of the day, I put it
all out on the table.

1:04:46.182 --> 1:04:48.985
Well, I'm here to
shake things up.

1:04:49.051 --> 1:04:51.687
Something's going down
and I can definitely feel

1:04:51.754 --> 1:04:52.788
the stress in the air.

1:04:52.855 --> 1:04:56.726
The next phase, overnight dates
in the fantasy suites.

1:04:56.792 --> 1:04:58.728
Today's gonna be a huge day.

1:04:58.794 --> 1:05:00.162
I feel like there's
gonna be break ups.

1:05:00.229 --> 1:05:02.031
I don't know if I'm
ready for this.

1:05:02.098 --> 1:05:05.668
Drama and the romance,
that's all coming to an end.

1:05:05.735 --> 1:05:07.036
Right now, it feels to me
like you don't even

1:05:07.103 --> 1:05:08.971
want to take this
outside of here.

1:05:09.038 --> 1:05:11.207
Now I'm starting to
feel like I've been

1:05:11.274 --> 1:05:12.975
gaslit throughout
all of this.

1:05:13.042 --> 1:05:19.615
Today is the day that
everything in Paradise changes.

1:05:19.682 --> 1:05:21.550
Okay, we have the popcorn.
Can you put on a movie for us?

1:05:21.617 --> 1:05:23.586
- You have to pick a show.
- Give us some drama.

1:05:23.653 --> 1:05:26.522
- I want The Notebook.
- What do you want?!

1:05:26.589 --> 1:05:29.759
- We definitely need Mike.
- I don't know!

1:05:29.825 --> 1:05:31.594
- Dirty Dancing.
- Yeah.

1:05:31.661 --> 1:05:33.596
I'm ready, you just have
to believe me.

1:05:33.663 --> 1:05:35.931
-
- I don't know.

1:05:35.998 --> 1:05:37.466
Are you gonna catch me?

1:05:39.168 --> 1:05:40.803
I got you.

1:05:40.870 --> 1:05:42.505
Come to me.

1:05:47.843 --> 1:05:50.212
I want Ghost, Ghost.

1:05:50.279 --> 1:05:51.947
I'm gonna pull these out.

1:05:55.584 --> 1:05:57.954
♪ OH, MY LOVE.

1:05:58.020 --> 1:06:00.656
Oh! Ha-ha!
