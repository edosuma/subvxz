01:43.379 --> 01:45.967
- Hey.

01:46.865 --> 01:47.935
Are you okay?

02:03.951 --> 02:05.021
Are you okay?

02:15.583 --> 02:16.860
- What the fu...

02:30.150 --> 02:33.222
â™ª Ha, ha, ha ha, haa

06:37.776 --> 06:39.121
- I know.

06:39.122 --> 06:40.054
I know.

06:40.055 --> 06:41.366
I start my new job in a week.

06:43.472 --> 06:45.128
You'll get your money back.

06:46.716 --> 06:47.716
Thanks.

09:10.860 --> 09:12.448
Do you remember me?

09:20.421 --> 09:22.423
I've missed you so much.

09:24.149 --> 09:25.149
So much.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.642
Hey, slow down.

09:34.643 --> 09:36.092
I brought you a whole packet.

09:52.143 --> 09:53.143
It's okay.

09:58.701 --> 10:01.531
- Stay here, I'll be right back.

10:04.880 --> 10:05.949
Richard.

10:05.950 --> 10:06.778
- Paige.

10:06.779 --> 10:08.020
- Spit that out!

10:08.021 --> 10:09.193
I'm not going to waste
my money on medicine

10:09.194 --> 10:11.195
if you get a stomach ache.

10:11.196 --> 10:13.025
- You make me sick.

10:13.026 --> 10:16.580
Eight years, eight years ago
you took her away from me

10:16.581 --> 10:17.926
and for what?

10:17.927 --> 10:19.963
So she can live in this dump?

10:19.964 --> 10:22.760
And if that wasn't enough, she
still doesn't say a word.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.418
Now that's all going to change.

10:28.317 --> 10:29.835
- What's this?

10:29.836 --> 10:32.976
- It explains just how bad
a mother you actually are.

10:32.977 --> 10:35.220
You do realize they're
coming to pick her up.

10:37.084 --> 10:39.499
- I've never seen a social
worker around here.

10:39.500 --> 10:43.193
- I will not allow my daughter
to be taken into care.

10:43.194 --> 10:44.401
Come on, Mindy.

10:44.402 --> 10:45.230
- What do you think
you're doing?

10:45.230 --> 10:46.197
- She's coming with me!

10:46.198 --> 10:48.061
- She's not going anywhere!

11:00.073 --> 11:03.006
- Why the fuck are you
pissing off my woman?

11:03.007 --> 11:05.250
- I just want my daughter back.

11:06.562 --> 11:08.115
I can give her a future.

11:09.669 --> 11:12.981
Next week I'm starting
a new job, a good job.

11:12.982 --> 11:14.293
- Just leave.

11:14.294 --> 11:16.329
- Paige, just listen to me.

11:20.369 --> 11:21.818
- Are you deaf?

11:21.819 --> 11:23.441
Get the fuck out of here.

11:25.512 --> 11:27.547
- You've tattooed her name.

11:27.548 --> 11:29.550
Well I hope for you,
it's not permanent.

11:34.901 --> 11:36.316
- You talk too much.

11:37.455 --> 11:38.905
I am going to count to three.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.080
One,

11:44.289 --> 11:45.289
two,

11:47.051 --> 11:47.879
three!

11:47.879 --> 11:48.879
- Okay.

11:50.399 --> 11:51.849
Okay, I'm leaving.

11:59.097 --> 12:00.374
I'll be back, sweetheart.

12:05.000 --> 12:06.000
I promise.

12:31.267 --> 12:32.474
Another one.

12:32.475 --> 12:36.237
- Make it a double and
I'll have a beer.

12:36.238 --> 12:37.238
Bad day?

12:39.379 --> 12:40.379
It's on me.

12:46.973 --> 12:47.973
- I'm Richard.

12:48.940 --> 12:51.011
- To Richard and
Sasha, the strangers.

12:52.116 --> 12:53.599
- Is it that obvious?

12:53.600 --> 12:55.671
- Nobody here goes around
on a rented bicycle.

12:57.397 --> 12:59.985
So, what brings you here?

12:59.986 --> 13:00.986
- Family matters.

13:01.746 --> 13:04.506
Unpleasant family matters.

13:04.507 --> 13:05.922
- Well, if it's any consolation,

13:05.923 --> 13:06.855
who doesn't have them?

13:06.856 --> 13:09.028
- Yeah, life shits on everybody,

13:09.029 --> 13:10.548
but with me, it had diarrhea.

13:11.756 --> 13:13.930
I've made so many
mistakes in my life,

13:13.931 --> 13:15.310
now I want to put things right.

13:15.311 --> 13:17.174
I don't know where to begin.

13:17.175 --> 13:19.694
- Are we talking about
a broken heart?

13:19.695 --> 13:22.007
- No, the end of my
relationship was

13:22.008 --> 13:24.562
one of the few good things
that happened to me.

13:28.808 --> 13:31.051
Today my heart beats
for just one person.

13:33.088 --> 13:35.538
And I'm happy to say, she
feels the same way too.

13:36.919 --> 13:39.058
- Oh, she's beautiful.

13:39.059 --> 13:41.233
Is this your daughter?

13:41.234 --> 13:42.304
- Her name is Mindy.

13:44.237 --> 13:46.411
And I need to get her
back at all costs.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.207
- Do you want to talk about it?

13:50.208 --> 13:51.622
Come on, I can help
you take your mind

13:51.623 --> 13:52.623
off things for a while.

13:52.624 --> 13:53.866
- You're not one of those...

13:53.867 --> 13:55.869
- No, of course I'm not.

13:58.768 --> 13:59.768
- Okay.

14:01.219 --> 14:03.703
- To Mindy.

14:03.704 --> 14:04.704
- To Mindy.

15:42.803 --> 15:44.944
I haven't enjoyed
myself this much since,

15:46.428 --> 15:48.223
I can't even remember
the last time.

15:50.535 --> 15:53.158
Perhaps this is what
we really need,

15:53.159 --> 15:55.229
the simple things in life,

15:55.230 --> 15:57.646
without ulterior motives.

15:59.234 --> 16:00.234
Like tonight.

16:03.272 --> 16:04.272
Thank you.

16:07.276 --> 16:08.795
- Why don't you hire a lawyer?

16:10.176 --> 16:11.279
A good one.

16:11.280 --> 16:12.487
You are her father.

16:12.488 --> 16:14.731
A lawyer could help
to get her back.

16:14.732 --> 16:18.804
- Sasha, I'm still paying back
the debts my ex-wife ran up.

16:18.805 --> 16:21.290
I don't know when I'll be
able to afford a lawyer.

16:25.156 --> 16:26.399
What an idiot.

16:27.469 --> 16:28.469
- I can help.

16:30.334 --> 16:32.473
I can help to get
the money you need.

16:32.474 --> 16:34.164
- Yeah, right.

16:34.165 --> 16:36.822
- 25,000.

16:36.823 --> 16:37.651
- What?

16:37.652 --> 16:39.169
- 25,000 euro.

16:39.170 --> 16:40.757
Is that enough?

16:40.758 --> 16:42.208
- What are you talking about?

16:43.692 --> 16:45.451
- Tomorrow there is a new
theatrical format nearby,

16:45.452 --> 16:47.108
where a group of
aspiring actors will be

16:47.109 --> 16:50.042
closed inside a
theater for 24 hours,

16:50.043 --> 16:52.872
a whole day of pure
improvisation with no script.

16:52.873 --> 16:55.392
It's incredible and
the best part is,

16:55.393 --> 16:57.118
the actor who gives
the best performance

16:57.119 --> 16:58.809
wins the cash prize.

16:58.810 --> 17:00.156
- That sounds too
good to be true.

17:00.157 --> 17:01.226
- But it is.

17:01.227 --> 17:02.951
I've been chosen
to take part and

17:02.952 --> 17:04.505
you could come with
me tomorrow morning.

17:04.506 --> 17:06.023
- Why would they
let me take part?

17:06.025 --> 17:08.473
I mean, I don't even
know how to act.

17:08.474 --> 17:11.443
- Come on, I'm sure they'll
give you a chance because

17:11.444 --> 17:13.376
well, I don't think
it's actually legal

17:13.377 --> 17:16.689
seeing as I found it looking for
easy money in the deep web.

17:16.690 --> 17:18.897
- If it's illegal, how do
you know they'll pay you?

17:18.898 --> 17:21.315
- I think there must be
some clandestine gambling.

17:21.316 --> 17:23.180
I'd have more doubts
if it was legal.

17:24.250 --> 17:25.871
Just give it a try.

17:25.872 --> 17:27.769
When will you get another
occasion like this?

17:27.770 --> 17:29.013
What do you have to lose?

19:04.281 --> 19:05.281
- Morning.

19:06.179 --> 19:07.422
- Good morning.

19:08.595 --> 19:11.977
- Well, are you coming with me?

19:23.610 --> 19:25.785
This should be the place.

19:57.851 --> 20:00.059
Sorry, it's my fault, but
he's perfect for the show.

20:00.060 --> 20:01.578
He's an outsider too, he's...

20:02.409 --> 20:03.925
What?

20:13.729 --> 20:15.730
- I can see him.

20:15.731 --> 20:17.043
We need to make a change.

20:19.287 --> 20:20.607
- Listen, are you
sure about this?

20:21.737 --> 20:23.807
And I didn't like the
look of that guy.

20:23.808 --> 20:25.223
- Be a little more
optimistic and

20:25.224 --> 20:26.465
everything will work out fine.

20:26.466 --> 20:27.811
It's called the law
of attraction.

20:27.812 --> 20:29.780
- Yeah, if you say so.

21:31.738 --> 21:32.738
- I told you that...

21:40.540 --> 21:42.542
Ah right, the rules.

22:23.342 --> 22:26.102
See? Not that bad.

22:26.103 --> 22:28.795
- Well, certainly better
than the outside.

22:45.018 --> 22:47.573
- Hey guys, come over here.

23:01.069 --> 23:02.069
I'm Debbie.

23:03.105 --> 23:04.899
- I'm Richard.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.281
- Sasha, pleased to meet you.

23:07.282 --> 23:08.662
And you?

23:08.663 --> 23:09.663
- Kurt.

23:12.563 --> 23:15.496
- Uh, where are you from?

23:15.497 --> 23:17.567
- It's not important
where I'm from,

23:17.568 --> 23:18.707
but where I'm headed.

23:19.915 --> 23:20.778
And you?

23:20.779 --> 23:22.020
Where are you from?

23:22.021 --> 23:23.021
- I'm English.

23:24.610 --> 23:26.058
- And you?

23:26.059 --> 23:27.059
- Ukraine.

23:30.650 --> 23:32.824
- That's not a joint, is it?

23:32.825 --> 23:35.896
- It's not important what
it is, but how it smokes.

23:35.897 --> 23:37.139
Why don't you get a life.

23:38.106 --> 23:39.106
- Uh, calm down.

23:40.142 --> 23:41.936
- Move, get down!

23:41.937 --> 23:43.577
Everybody goes to the
center of the stage.

23:47.909 --> 23:49.772
You, on your knees.

23:49.773 --> 23:51.877
I said on your knees!

23:51.878 --> 23:52.947
- What's going on?

23:52.948 --> 23:53.949
- Shut the fuck up!

24:04.719 --> 24:05.719
Look at me.

24:06.755 --> 24:07.755
Look at me!

24:10.863 --> 24:12.278
- No, no, please.

24:36.026 --> 24:38.303
- This is a fucking farce.

24:42.550 --> 24:43.723
- Well done.

24:45.380 --> 24:46.967
A wonderful performance,

24:46.968 --> 24:49.383
but let me introduce myself.

24:49.384 --> 24:52.559
I'm the director and my
audience greatly appreciated

24:52.560 --> 24:56.355
this little introduction
and they want to see more,

24:56.356 --> 24:58.738
so please, continue.

25:01.292 --> 25:03.224
- Did you hear that?

25:03.225 --> 25:05.399
They're giving me compliments.

25:05.400 --> 25:06.712
Did you see my performance?

25:07.920 --> 25:09.403
- Performance?

25:09.404 --> 25:10.819
You nearly shit yourself.

25:16.273 --> 25:18.550
Oh no, please.

25:18.551 --> 25:20.897
Eh, fuck this bullshit.

25:20.898 --> 25:22.243
I'm leaving.

25:35.361 --> 25:36.982
- Come on, let's go.

25:36.983 --> 25:39.226
- You have just met
mask number one

25:39.227 --> 25:43.161
and mask number two, who
together with three other masks

25:43.162 --> 25:45.336
will form the team of hunters.

25:51.170 --> 25:54.552
So please, accept my apologies
for not having been

25:54.553 --> 25:56.830
completely sincere with you.

25:56.831 --> 26:00.143
But then again, without
a little deception,

26:00.144 --> 26:03.320
there would have been no
fun for our audience.

26:15.435 --> 26:16.850
- What the fuck's going on?

26:16.851 --> 26:17.851
- I don't know.

26:20.889 --> 26:23.304
- Ladies and gentlemen,

26:23.305 --> 26:24.790
you are the actors of future.

26:28.759 --> 26:30.518
I am pleased to inform you,

26:30.519 --> 26:32.762
that thanks to this
opening performance,

26:32.763 --> 26:37.525
the winner's prize has
increased to 100,000 euros,

26:37.526 --> 26:39.389
which will be divided
by those who manage

26:39.390 --> 26:41.807
to stay alive until
tomorrow morning.

26:43.256 --> 26:47.225
However, in order to win
the money, you, the prey,

26:47.226 --> 26:49.228
have to eliminate the
team of hunters.

26:50.367 --> 26:52.230
But the hunters will
share the money

26:52.231 --> 26:54.715
if they manage to
eliminate all of you.

26:54.716 --> 26:58.098
On one condition, they
have to take their time

26:58.099 --> 27:02.931
and be creative in order to make
the show more entertaining.

27:04.070 --> 27:06.313
And you as their prey,

27:06.314 --> 27:08.246
should know that we have
cameras everywhere.

27:08.247 --> 27:09.730
- We're not safe here.

27:09.731 --> 27:13.632
- So searching for a
hiding place is pointless.

27:15.047 --> 27:16.082
- We need to get out.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.636
- Wait.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.223
Wait.

27:20.224 --> 27:25.229
Didn't you hear him?

27:28.612 --> 27:31.649
- Welcome to the one, the only,

27:31.650 --> 27:33.237
theatrical team death match.

27:34.204 --> 27:36.308
Die in one day.

27:36.309 --> 27:37.621
Let the massacre begin.

29:08.677 --> 29:10.990
- Jesus, you're frightening.

31:03.068 --> 31:05.069
- If you think about it,
we have an advantage.

31:05.070 --> 31:06.587
- Which is?

31:06.588 --> 31:08.866
- Like he said, they can't
kill us right away.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.799
- Your definition of advantage
leaves a lot to be desired.

31:11.800 --> 31:13.111
- I know it's brutal, but...

31:13.112 --> 31:14.595
- Listen.

31:14.596 --> 31:17.841
I have no intention of getting
killed, not now nor later.

31:21.741 --> 31:23.259
- Fuck, fuck.
- Hey.

31:23.260 --> 31:24.917
- Hey, over there.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.189
What I was trying to tell you is

31:56.190 --> 31:57.500
we have a chance
to win the money.

31:57.501 --> 31:58.330
- Shit.

31:58.330 --> 31:59.227
Fuck.

31:59.227 --> 32:00.194
Fuck.

32:00.195 --> 32:01.401
- Richard, I'm being serious.

32:01.402 --> 32:02.781
- So am I.

32:02.782 --> 32:04.956
I was always told to
keep out of trouble.

32:04.957 --> 32:05.820
- It's a lot of money.

32:05.821 --> 32:07.200
Think about Mindy.

32:11.067 --> 32:12.033
- What's happening?

32:12.034 --> 32:15.140
- Come on.

32:17.280 --> 32:18.280
Debbie?

33:16.649 --> 33:19.480
- Do you think we
should help her?

33:27.833 --> 33:28.833
- Look.

35:24.122 --> 35:25.122
Debbie!

35:52.391 --> 35:54.565
- Run, Sasha, run!

38:51.018 --> 38:52.018
- Fuck.

41:20.167 --> 41:22.824
- Communication to the hunters,

41:22.825 --> 41:24.446
a bonus will be awarded
if you manage to

41:24.447 --> 41:28.208
eliminate one of the two
remaining contestants

41:28.209 --> 41:30.246
in the next few minutes.

41:31.489 --> 41:34.733
But remember, it has
to be done with style.

42:05.453 --> 42:06.800
- You've tattooed her name.

44:10.855 --> 44:11.855
Why him?

44:13.478 --> 44:15.030
Tell me.

44:15.031 --> 44:16.031
Why him?

44:18.656 --> 44:21.451
What the fuck does
all this mean?

44:25.663 --> 44:26.663
Fuck.

44:28.251 --> 44:29.251
Fuck!

45:13.124 --> 45:14.124
- Fuck.

45:49.505 --> 45:50.919
- Come on you fucking freak.

45:50.920 --> 45:51.921
Bring it on!

56:59.174 --> 57:00.174
- Richard?

57:02.177 --> 57:03.315
- Don't touch me.

57:03.316 --> 57:04.628
Stay away from me.

57:06.388 --> 57:08.390
This, what does it mean?

57:09.322 --> 57:10.805
- It's...

57:10.806 --> 57:12.773
- You knew about this from
the start and you set me up.

57:12.774 --> 57:13.740
- I can explain.

57:13.740 --> 57:14.569
- What?

57:14.569 --> 57:15.501
What can you explain?

57:15.502 --> 57:17.018
- It's not what you think.

57:17.019 --> 57:20.228
I mean, yes, I
knew who you were,

57:20.229 --> 57:22.023
and I did everything to
get you to take part,

57:22.024 --> 57:25.407
but I swear, I didn't know
that this would happen.

57:27.305 --> 57:28.721
I thought it was just a game.

57:32.345 --> 57:35.348
I know, I made a mistake.

57:37.488 --> 57:38.696
With the letter too.

57:41.906 --> 57:43.148
I did it for Mindy.

57:43.149 --> 57:45.184
- Leave my daughter out of this!

57:45.185 --> 57:48.118
- She may be your daughter,
but she's also my sister.

57:48.119 --> 57:50.535
My name is Sasha,
short for Alexandra.

57:50.536 --> 57:51.570
Paige is my mother.

57:51.571 --> 57:52.814
I'm her first child.

57:59.165 --> 58:01.649
- I knew she'd been married
before in Russia...

58:01.650 --> 58:02.650
- Ukraine.

58:03.997 --> 58:06.102
- I didn't know she
had a daughter.

58:06.103 --> 58:08.000
- Of course you didn't.

58:08.001 --> 58:10.521
When I was 13, she sold
me to start a new life.

58:11.729 --> 58:13.903
When I finally found
her six months ago,

58:13.904 --> 58:15.768
I discovered that
I had a sister.

58:17.045 --> 58:19.080
We immediately became close.

58:19.081 --> 58:22.083
I go to visit her every
time she's alone.

58:22.084 --> 58:25.362
And she is also so
sweet, so innocent.

58:25.363 --> 58:28.124
I swore to myself that
what happened to me

58:28.125 --> 58:29.609
would never happen to her.

58:31.059 --> 58:32.646
And I tried everything to
get her away from Paige,

58:32.647 --> 58:34.649
but it was useless.

58:41.621 --> 58:42.621
Please,

58:43.623 --> 58:44.623
forgive me.

58:46.005 --> 58:50.422
I just wanted to improve
our chances of winning.

58:50.423 --> 58:51.423
- Sasha...

59:02.539 --> 59:03.539
- Richard!

59:18.451 --> 59:19.451
You.

59:20.280 --> 59:21.280
- Me.

59:23.318 --> 59:25.664
We are not that different.

59:25.665 --> 59:28.253
I do it for the money too.

59:28.254 --> 59:30.048
- You're nothing but
a sick bastard.

01:00:13.713 --> 01:00:15.715
- Yeah, I'm a sick fuck.

01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:21.824
And you know what I'm
going to do when I win?

01:00:21.825 --> 01:00:26.830
I will sell that little bitch
to the first pedo I can find.

01:00:28.003 --> 01:00:31.006
But, your mother was
wrong about one thing.

01:00:32.905 --> 01:00:35.907
She said you weren't a worth
shit compared to your sister,

01:00:35.908 --> 01:00:38.704
but today, you are
worth a fortune.

01:00:40.533 --> 01:00:43.570
- For you two, money
is never enough.

01:00:50.785 --> 01:00:51.648
- Shh,

01:00:51.648 --> 01:00:52.476
shh,

01:00:52.476 --> 01:00:53.476
shhh.

01:00:58.862 --> 01:01:00.035
Now it's your turn.

01:01:01.036 --> 01:01:02.658
- Stop.

01:01:02.659 --> 01:01:06.041
If there is one thing
I can not stand,

01:01:07.215 --> 01:01:10.494
it is seeing my simple
rules being broken.

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:15.084
You can not eliminate
one of your teammates.

01:01:15.085 --> 01:01:17.949
My audience isn't
paying for this.

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:21.021
They are paying to
enjoy the show.

01:01:21.022 --> 01:01:23.333
- Fuck you and fuck your rules!

01:01:23.334 --> 01:01:24.334
I want my...

01:01:28.615 --> 01:01:29.961
- Run.

01:01:29.962 --> 01:01:30.962
Run.

01:01:50.016 --> 01:01:53.399
- I bet you are thinking
about Mindy right now.

01:01:55.194 --> 01:01:56.194
So am I.

01:02:01.890 --> 01:02:05.341
- Go to fucking hell.

01:02:33.611 --> 01:02:34.992
- Sasha.

01:02:37.270 --> 01:02:38.477
- I don't want to die.

01:02:38.478 --> 01:02:39.927
I don't want to die.

01:04:12.434 --> 01:04:14.091
- Finally alone, eh?

01:04:15.506 --> 01:04:16.506
Eh bitch?!

01:04:45.812 --> 01:04:46.812
- Debbie!

01:04:49.506 --> 01:04:50.506
Richard!

01:05:48.116 --> 01:05:50.255
Did you like the show,
mother fuckers?

01:10:54.388 --> 01:10:56.597
The day we give them
back to each other again

01:10:57.805 --> 01:10:59.945
will be the day I take
you away from here.

01:11:23.244 --> 01:11:25.039
I'm here to report
a missing person.

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:27.040
- When?

01:11:27.835 --> 01:11:28.938
- When?

01:11:28.939 --> 01:11:30.699
When she went missing?

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:33.426
Uh, this morning or
perhaps yesterday.

01:11:33.427 --> 01:11:34.427
I'm not sure.

01:11:38.570 --> 01:11:39.570
- Fill this in.

01:11:46.232 --> 01:11:48.096
- You should be ashamed
of yourselves.

01:11:48.994 --> 01:11:49.960
Forget it.

01:11:49.961 --> 01:11:51.548
I'll go elsewhere, assholes.

01:12:13.570 --> 01:12:14.846
- Hello?

01:12:14.847 --> 01:12:16.296
- I served her up
to you on a plate

01:12:16.297 --> 01:12:18.540
and you didn't
manage to kill her.

01:12:18.541 --> 01:12:19.369
I also lost Vinnie.

01:12:19.370 --> 01:12:20.990
I want compensation now.

01:12:20.991 --> 01:12:24.062
- You will receive much more
than you can possibly imagine.

01:12:24.063 --> 01:12:26.858
We are taking the show
to the next level.

01:12:26.859 --> 01:12:28.619
- And what makes you
think she'll come back?

01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:30.484
- Oh, she'll come back.

01:12:32.106 --> 01:12:34.246
Because she is the best
player we ever met.

01:12:35.661 --> 01:12:39.941
And you, you are going to sell
me what she is looking for.
