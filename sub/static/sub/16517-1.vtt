00:23.624 --> 00:25.659
Sophie,
what are you doing?

00:25.693 --> 00:27.295
I don't know.

00:27.328 --> 00:29.263
You should take more
like this.

00:29.297 --> 00:30.431
Like this one?

00:30.464 --> 00:31.665
No, that's boring.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.501
No, it's not.

00:33.534 --> 00:37.571
It's pretty, you know,
and, oh, so emotional,

00:37.605 --> 00:39.707
but this crowd one here...

00:39.740 --> 00:41.409
No, no.
See, this one

00:41.442 --> 00:44.145
is about being
stuck in one place.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.579
You know, it's a commentary
on high school--

00:45.613 --> 00:47.448
how we're shackled
by our roots,

00:47.481 --> 00:50.551
unable to actually get close
to another person.

00:50.584 --> 00:52.153
It's like being stuck
in a prison.

00:52.186 --> 00:55.156
You're alive, but alone.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.757
Wow.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.592
Oh, really, you should take
more like this one.

00:58.626 --> 00:59.627
I like it.

00:59.660 --> 01:02.096
It's-- it's interesting.

01:03.531 --> 01:06.667
The picture, yes.
The people, no.

01:06.700 --> 01:09.837
Not interesting,
not here, not at all.

01:09.870 --> 01:11.339
Thanks.

01:11.372 --> 01:13.574
You want to get out of here
as badly as I do.

01:13.607 --> 01:14.708
This place stinks.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.544
This stuff stinks.

01:16.577 --> 01:18.846
You know, there are
easier ways to take photos.

01:18.879 --> 01:19.847
SOPHIE:
Oh yeah?

01:19.880 --> 01:21.449
Yeah.

01:21.482 --> 01:24.185
I heard about it
on a compu-tear.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.254
I don't know
if I'm saying that right.

01:26.287 --> 01:30.158
Computer, com-pu-tar.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.659
Anyways, I heard about it
on the news

01:31.692 --> 01:34.128
and apparently
they make machines

01:34.162 --> 01:37.331
where you can actually
Photoshop pictures.

01:37.365 --> 01:39.333
Yeah, it's not as good.

01:42.270 --> 01:44.238
Hey, Soph.

01:44.272 --> 01:47.541
And bam, simple.

01:47.575 --> 01:50.778
I'm an artist.
This is art.

01:50.811 --> 01:53.147
You know, some things are
more satisfying with hard work.

01:53.181 --> 01:54.615
Well, Miss Hard Work,

01:54.648 --> 01:56.384
you're late for
your shift at the diner.

01:56.417 --> 01:57.751
Oh, Pop Rocks.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.553
Pop Rocks is not
an adequate swear word.

02:13.234 --> 02:15.736
* You think
you know me well *

02:15.769 --> 02:20.641
* But I suggest you take
A closer look *

02:22.810 --> 02:26.314
* Got one foot
Outside the door *

02:26.347 --> 02:29.217
* And I'm not coming back

02:29.250 --> 02:32.553

I have *

To be a blur *

An instant replay *

Rollerblades maybe.

* It's gonna
Drive you crazy *

03:01.549 --> 03:02.650
Hi.

03:02.683 --> 03:03.684
Sophie, you need
roller skates, dear.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.353
I know.
I just said that.

03:07.955 --> 03:11.959
* In an instant replay,
Baby *

Oh!

03:31.779 --> 03:32.746
Late again?

03:32.780 --> 03:33.947
Yes, now shush.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.949
Shush, Tommy.

03:35.983 --> 03:38.886
Sorry.
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

Of course.

( SIGHS ) Hello, Emily,
Kate Lynn and Caitlyn.

04:08.782 --> 04:10.351
You work here?

04:10.384 --> 04:11.652
Yeah.

04:11.685 --> 04:15.022
Just started here...
four years ago.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.057
So do they
make you wear that?

04:17.089 --> 04:18.459
No.

04:18.492 --> 04:20.761
Then why don't you
take the money

04:20.793 --> 04:22.796
that you make here
and go shopping?

04:22.830 --> 04:24.598
Saving up to get out
of this town.

04:24.632 --> 04:26.700
I mean, it's better
to get through it now

04:26.734 --> 04:28.502
and have fun
later in life, right?

04:28.536 --> 04:30.938
I mean, can you imagine
peaking in high school

04:30.971 --> 04:34.575
and being stuck here
for the last 70 years
of your life?

04:34.608 --> 04:36.544
You used to like it here.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.812
Yeah, well,
we used to be friends.

04:38.846 --> 04:40.614
Yeah,
before you started acting

04:40.648 --> 04:43.551
like you were better than me
just because you wear black.

04:43.584 --> 04:45.419
You know,
I really wanted to buy

04:45.453 --> 04:47.721
some super chunky wedges
from the '90s,

04:47.755 --> 04:49.923
but the clerk said
that three snotty chicks

04:49.957 --> 04:51.859
bought them all up.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.661
Okay, see ya.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.796
The dance is coming up.

Yeah, the girl-ask-guy
valentine dance.

05:02.403 --> 05:04.572
Uh, I'm going.
Um...

with Aaron.

05:07.908 --> 05:11.845
Aaron? Really?

05:11.879 --> 05:15.383
That's so weird because
I'm going with Aaron.

05:15.416 --> 05:16.884
I asked him this morning.

05:16.917 --> 05:18.786
So mean.

05:18.819 --> 05:19.953
Aaron?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.423
Yeah.

05:22.456 --> 05:25.493
Uh, no, no.
Not that Aaron.

05:25.526 --> 05:26.660
Hah, no, eew.

Um, I'm going with my Aaron.

05:30.564 --> 05:32.400
Yeah.
It's a different dude.

He's not from here.

we don't believe you.

because you're 200 years old

this morning."

07:01.188 --> 07:02.690
Weird because he told me

that you were stupid
at lunch yesterday.

07:04.958 --> 07:06.827
Oh, I should have said that.

thrown coffee at her.

that I said it three times?

07:47.668 --> 07:48.769

07:48.802 --> 07:50.270
That means
I really meant it.

wanted to scare you.

to get the pink one.

But it was all covered
with ribbons and bows...

be five to me.

you have.

I will get you the gifts
that you would never get
for yourself, okay?

Okay.

Oh, frames.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.255
Yeah. I want you to frame
those pictures that you take.

You need to.
You have to.

09:17.024 --> 09:18.626

You will.

Oh, but not this one.

really cute.

Mm-hmm.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.075
Oh, a book on screenwriting?

09:35.108 --> 09:36.977
Yeah. I thought it would
help you finish your play.

09:37.010 --> 09:39.012
Yeah. I can't get
that third act down.

Small explosions.

Since when does she
play guitar?

Okay, okay.

My turn.

have to be at the airport?

to the airport.

Grandma going to drive?

You can't worry
all the time, kiddo.

one where she can put
a gun rack on the back.

to the party?

she invited me.

from robbing another bank.

11:41.301 --> 11:42.770
Good.
That's smart, yeah.

around or something

Aaron be taking me?

of you driving alone, so...

was cool though.

I-- yeah, do you know what?
Yeah, you're right.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.906
I wanted to leave
my comfy trailer to end up

21:46.939 --> 21:48.875
in a stinky old trunk
that smells like feet.

21:48.908 --> 21:50.943
You were in a trailer?

21:50.977 --> 21:52.779
I-- I was at work.

21:52.812 --> 21:53.980
You work in a trailer?

21:54.013 --> 21:55.815
No, I'm an actor.

21:55.848 --> 21:58.017
Oh, yeah,
I remember you.

21:58.050 --> 21:59.786
Yeah?

21:59.819 --> 22:02.555
I think all that hairspray
is getting to your brain.

22:02.589 --> 22:04.424
How much of that
did you use?

22:04.457 --> 22:06.593
I was going to
a friend's after work.
It doesn't ma--

22:06.626 --> 22:09.061
Okay, there's something
seriously crazy going on
right now,

22:09.095 --> 22:10.397
and you're asking me
about hairspray?

22:10.430 --> 22:11.731
How does that
make sense to you?

22:11.764 --> 22:13.099
None of this
makes sense to me.

22:27.614 --> 22:29.348
Uh, where are my waffles?

My name is Sophie,
by the way.

That's a weird name
for a witch.
I'm not a witch.

22:37.123 --> 22:38.525
Then why are you
dressed like one?

22:38.558 --> 22:39.759
Like what?
A witch.

22:39.792 --> 22:40.893
I'm not a witch.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.529
If I was,
I would have probably

22:42.562 --> 22:44.497
already poofed you back
to wherever you came from.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.165
Wait, can you do that?

22:46.198 --> 22:49.068
Because I have to be in LA
on Monday for an audition.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.803
Yeah, I'll take you
to the airport.

22:50.837 --> 22:52.038
I don't have my wallet.

22:52.071 --> 22:53.473
So? Just have
one of your friends

22:53.506 --> 22:54.907
book a ticket online
or something.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.075
I'm sure your girlfriend
has money.

22:56.108 --> 22:58.144
No.
No girlfriend?

22:58.177 --> 22:59.912
Maybe if you weren't
yelling all the time.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.080
It is kind of a turnoff.

without my ID.

I saw your last movie.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.577
It wasn't very good.

23:32.645 --> 23:33.546
Thank you.

Hey, buddy, you in there?

Oh, man.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.083
Seemed so real.

24:16.756 --> 24:18.257
You're out there,
aren't you?

24:18.290 --> 24:19.792
Yep.

24:19.826 --> 24:21.160
Not a dream, then?

24:21.193 --> 24:22.094
Nope.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.100
I thought I could try to see
how you poofed here.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.702
Got it.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.203
I don't normally
lay in there, you know.

24:31.237 --> 24:32.872
Sure.

a donut, at least?

are all out, so...

24:39.879 --> 24:41.147
So where'd you go?

24:41.180 --> 24:42.949
I was actually
doing your dishes.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.617
Oh, thank you.

24:44.651 --> 24:46.886
It only felt right.
Because I made you waffles?

24:46.919 --> 24:49.656
No. Because I borrowed
your cell phone to call
my agent.

24:49.689 --> 24:51.223
Nice.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.760

this crazy story
about how I got here.

But the good news is
she's sending my wallet.

24:56.629 --> 24:58.531
Um, it's Friday.

24:58.565 --> 25:00.700
So? They do
Saturday deliveries.

Aw, you should have told me.

25:13.613 --> 25:14.747
Why? Who cares?

25:14.781 --> 25:16.115
You want me
to make some cupcakes

25:16.148 --> 25:17.884
for you to
take in to school?

25:17.917 --> 25:19.218

get going to school

boxes your ears.

Cool.

I'll see you later, baby.

Bye.

Fine?
Mm-hmm. Just stay here.

on staying here, all right?

celebrating your birthday?

Oh, I know why--

how to have fun.

birthdays.

everyone pays attention to you.

to high school before.

27:52.805 --> 27:56.175
What? No, actually,
that explains a lot.

27:56.208 --> 27:57.443
Well, I've been working
since I was eight,

27:57.476 --> 27:59.111
so I just had
a tutor on set.

27:59.145 --> 28:01.948

and I've played a kid on TV,

in a school without cameras.

Well, this is school.
Nobody likes it.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.455
Okay, good to know.
What else?

28:09.488 --> 28:11.758
Well, this is high school.

It's a broken home
built on stress

28:15.194 --> 28:17.930

and desperation.

learning to be a grown-up,

for your friends
to backstab you,

backstabbing people.

DRAKE:
Sophs!

31:58.750 --> 32:01.187
Hey, you okay?
Nope. Yes.

32:01.220 --> 32:04.023
I mean, guys are jerks.
( SIGHS )

32:04.056 --> 32:05.691
I just knew I was
better than him anyway.

32:05.724 --> 32:07.559
Better?
Yeah.

32:07.593 --> 32:09.695
He's stuck in this small town
with these small people.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.597
I don't know.
Doesn't seem to be too bad.

32:11.630 --> 32:13.299
You've no idea.

32:13.332 --> 32:14.633
So I'm your boyfriend now,
right?

32:14.666 --> 32:16.068
Like, your jerky
boyfriend or...

32:16.102 --> 32:17.236
Well, I'm stuck
with you anyways.

32:17.269 --> 32:18.637
You might as well be useful.

32:18.670 --> 32:20.039
Cool, cool.

32:30.182 --> 32:33.185
( WHISPERING )
Why are you fighting with Emily?

32:33.219 --> 32:35.454
She got all weird with me.

32:35.487 --> 32:38.124
After she got weird with me.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.726
Right.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.629
Can you two be
more specific?

32:43.662 --> 32:46.198
Why did she stop
talking to me?

32:47.799 --> 32:49.368
That's a good point, Sophie.

32:52.338 --> 32:54.273
She knew I was having
a hard time...

32:56.475 --> 32:58.777
with my mom.

32:58.810 --> 33:00.779
She stopped talking to me.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.381
EMILY:
I didn't know what to say.

33:02.414 --> 33:05.217
I brought her flowers,
remember?

33:05.251 --> 33:07.319
( LOUDER ) Yeah, with a note
that said she was sorry

33:07.353 --> 33:08.687
and that she wanted
to take me out

33:08.720 --> 33:10.322
for shopping
and skinny lattes.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.591
When I'm depressed,
I shop, okay?

33:12.624 --> 33:15.327
I was just trying to help.
Ladies.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.096
Sorry.

33:17.129 --> 33:18.530
( WHISPERS ) We're just
trying to work some stuff out.

33:33.512 --> 33:35.047
This is PE.

33:35.081 --> 33:36.682
It's awful.
I don't have a costume.

33:36.715 --> 33:38.317
You call it that,
you're going to be dead

33:38.350 --> 33:39.451
before they blow
the first whistle.

33:39.485 --> 33:41.320
No, this is gym class.

33:41.353 --> 33:43.755
The Roman arena
of high school.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.058
No education here.
No learning.

33:46.092 --> 33:48.094
Just bloodshed

33:48.127 --> 33:50.462
where the weak
are fed to lions

33:50.496 --> 33:52.198
and the strong...

33:52.231 --> 33:54.032
No, you idiot!

33:57.236 --> 33:59.238
No, you idiot!

33:59.271 --> 34:00.672
Don't touch that.
You shouldn't be touching that

34:00.706 --> 34:02.541
if you don't know
how to make a basket.

34:02.574 --> 34:04.343
I got this.
Okay, no.

34:05.877 --> 34:07.813
Whoo!
Seriously?

34:07.846 --> 34:10.681
What? I've never thrown
a basketball before.

34:10.716 --> 34:12.083
My stuntman always did it.

34:12.118 --> 34:13.485
His name was Rex.
He was cool.

34:13.518 --> 34:17.456
So is it one hand or two?
What are the rules?

34:17.489 --> 34:19.725
We have got to get you
out of here.

34:19.757 --> 34:20.859
Me? I'm up.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.161
All right!

34:26.565 --> 34:27.699
( GASPS )

34:27.733 --> 34:29.335
Okay, I'll run.

34:29.368 --> 34:31.237
If I run to the car,
he'll poof to the car.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.871
I'll run him to safety.
Yeah!

34:32.904 --> 34:34.340
Sophie.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.208
No, you killed him!
You killed him, Cooper.

34:36.242 --> 34:37.208
It's all your fault.

34:37.243 --> 34:38.244
Killed who?

34:41.380 --> 34:43.349
BOYS: You're getting there,
you're getting there.

34:43.382 --> 34:44.750
BOY:
It's the first time.

34:44.783 --> 34:46.284
DRAKE:
Thanks, man.
Thank you.

34:46.318 --> 34:47.485
Never mind.
BOY:
All right.

34:52.257 --> 34:54.426
Eh...close.
Jump. It's like...

34:54.460 --> 34:56.362
Yeah.
Yeah, jump, too.

34:56.395 --> 34:59.298
DRAKE: So we're standing
up there and he's holding it

34:59.331 --> 35:00.766
and I'm like...
See you later, Englebert.

35:00.799 --> 35:01.900
Catch you later.

35:01.933 --> 35:03.369
Party.
Dude.

35:03.402 --> 35:05.437
Boom!
See you, brosky.

35:05.471 --> 35:08.207
I'm like, "There is
no way an egg can survive
that kind of fall."

35:08.240 --> 35:09.475
He's like, "Yeah, it can."

35:09.508 --> 35:10.909
So he drops it.
Guess what happens.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.145
The egg doesn't break.
Exactly. It was awesome!

35:13.179 --> 35:15.447
Yeah. You have
a TV, right?
Books?

35:15.481 --> 35:17.883
You live in a society where
the concept of science exists.

35:17.916 --> 35:19.718
It's not like you're Tarzan

35:19.751 --> 35:22.254
and you were poofed
out of a tree house
in a jungle.

35:22.288 --> 35:23.689
Okay, first of all,
don't say poof.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.491
And do you think
I'm stupid?

35:25.524 --> 35:27.393
That's the thing.
I don't think you are.

35:27.426 --> 35:29.461
It's just weird that
you find all this exciting.

35:29.495 --> 35:30.696
Okay, one second.
Stop.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.164
Let me ask you a question.

35:32.198 --> 35:34.700
Where is the coolest place
in the universe?

35:34.733 --> 35:36.168
"Star Wars" cantina.

35:36.202 --> 35:37.336
Wait, really?

35:37.369 --> 35:38.604
You disagree?

35:38.637 --> 35:40.472
No, no, no.
That's an awesome answer.

35:40.506 --> 35:42.908
Okay, so imagine you always
wanted to go to the cantina

35:42.941 --> 35:44.743
and then suddenly,
bam, you're there.

35:44.776 --> 35:46.412
Okay.

35:46.445 --> 35:48.680
And everything there
is amazing, like,
even the cups.

35:48.714 --> 35:50.382
You see cups on Earth
every single day,

35:50.416 --> 35:52.751
but a cup in the cantina,
that's still awesome.

35:52.784 --> 35:54.220
You know what I mean?

35:54.253 --> 35:55.887
I guess.
No, you know what I mean.

35:55.921 --> 35:58.357
You just have this whole,
like, hipster vibe going on.

35:58.390 --> 36:00.626
It's like, "I don't care."
That's very original,
by the way.

36:00.659 --> 36:02.694
I'm just being honest.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.563
You know,
every assistant in LA

36:04.596 --> 36:08.234
is just being honest before
they freak out at someone.

36:08.267 --> 36:10.669
It's easier than getting
people's hopes up.

36:10.702 --> 36:12.971
How is that easier?

36:13.004 --> 36:14.806
Well, I mean...

36:14.840 --> 36:17.843
No, you see,
I'm just being positive.

36:17.876 --> 36:19.578
Is that a bad thing?

36:19.611 --> 36:20.746
Well...

36:20.779 --> 36:22.348
You know, trees grow
better with water

36:22.381 --> 36:23.615
when they're burned
to the ground.

36:23.649 --> 36:24.650
You should remember that.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.218
Oh, I totally will.

36:26.252 --> 36:27.986
See, you're laughing at me.

36:28.019 --> 36:30.522
But any 10-year-old
on a skateboard,
any 90-year-old man,

36:30.556 --> 36:33.225
any lonely person
on the Internet--
they can be negative.

36:33.259 --> 36:35.927
That's easy.
That literally
takes no skill.

36:35.961 --> 36:38.597
But being positive,
that's hard.

36:38.630 --> 36:42.334
It takes a lot
of intellectualness.

36:42.368 --> 36:43.769
Great.
Super.

36:43.802 --> 36:45.771
Awesome.
I need an iced latte.

36:45.804 --> 36:49.775
Hm. You know, I-- I do more
than just criticize people.

36:49.808 --> 36:52.511
I do things.
I create.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.746
Really? Like what?

36:54.780 --> 36:56.282
Show me.

36:56.315 --> 36:57.749
Never mind.
No, no. I want to know.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.351
What is it?
Forget it.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.019
Is it something you make
in your big black cauldron--

37:01.052 --> 37:02.254
because witches have that,
you know?

37:02.288 --> 37:03.689
They make spells.

37:03.722 --> 37:06.492
Yeah, I get it.
We have to go.
Oh, okay.

37:06.525 --> 37:08.894
Wait, where are you going?
Where is she going?

37:08.927 --> 37:09.961
Oh, man.

37:16.802 --> 37:18.537
DRAKE:
Ah!

37:18.570 --> 37:20.372
Oh, hardy, har, har.

37:20.406 --> 37:22.374
Why don't you find
the positives in there?

37:22.408 --> 37:24.510
DRAKE:
Oh, I will.

37:24.543 --> 37:26.545
I found it. Let me out.
I'll tell you it.

37:26.578 --> 37:27.946
SOPHIE: ( GIGGLES ) Nope.
DRAKE: What?

37:27.979 --> 37:29.781
Hey, hey!
( GROANS )

37:40.526 --> 37:41.760
Are you coming?

37:41.793 --> 37:43.495
Hold on. I'm reading.

37:43.529 --> 37:44.496
Seriously, come on.

37:44.530 --> 37:46.932
Shh! Shh!

37:46.965 --> 37:48.700
Hey--
Come on! Come on!

37:50.802 --> 37:52.471
Drake, seriously, come on.

37:54.072 --> 37:54.973
Uh...

37:58.444 --> 37:59.345
Okay.

38:03.382 --> 38:04.816
Have you read
scene five yet?

38:04.850 --> 38:07.586
I have to read 20 pages
before Monday. Oh.

38:07.619 --> 38:09.788
You're not even in that class.
Stop pretending like you are.

38:09.821 --> 38:11.323
Fine.
Come on.

38:24.102 --> 38:26.605
Focusing on this experience
is keeping me from stressing out

38:26.638 --> 38:28.006
about all the auditions
I might miss

38:28.039 --> 38:29.941
if I don't make it
back to LA in time.

38:29.975 --> 38:31.443
That's annoying.

38:31.477 --> 38:33.512
DRAKE: Annoying?
I'm an actor.

38:33.545 --> 38:36.515
I-- I've a storm of unbridled
emotions under my skin

38:36.548 --> 38:38.384
just waiting to be unleashed
under the camera.

38:38.417 --> 38:39.785
Do you want me to freak out?

38:39.818 --> 38:41.420
Do you want the crying,
the tears,

38:41.453 --> 38:42.854
the emotion,
the drama?

38:42.888 --> 38:45.524
That can be annoying.

38:45.557 --> 38:46.958
What auditions?

38:46.992 --> 38:48.860
Oh, for this reality show.

38:48.894 --> 38:50.462
( SIGHS )

38:50.496 --> 38:51.830
No, no, no.
It's actually really cool.

38:51.863 --> 38:53.932
They get all of
these famous people

38:53.965 --> 38:56.134
and we go through
these obstacle courses
in the deep, dark jungle,

38:56.167 --> 38:57.703
and there's, like,
lions and tigers

38:57.736 --> 39:00.906
and snakes and malaria
and a hippo--

39:00.939 --> 39:02.808
a hippo and money.

39:02.841 --> 39:03.875
Cool.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.110
Plus exposure.

39:05.143 --> 39:06.512
Super cool.

39:06.545 --> 39:08.046
Yeah, it is.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.681
Way to stretch
those acting skills.

39:09.715 --> 39:11.016
What about the other one?

39:11.049 --> 39:13.752
Other what?
Well, you said auditions.

39:13.785 --> 39:15.454
What other audition
are you missing?

39:15.487 --> 39:18.957
Oh, it's, like,
this cop thing.

39:18.990 --> 39:20.058
Wait, what?

39:20.091 --> 39:21.493
What, what?

39:21.527 --> 39:23.495
( SIGHS )
Just a cop thing?

39:23.529 --> 39:25.397
Nothing is just
anything with you.

39:25.431 --> 39:28.400
You're the guy who gets excited
about cupcakes and basketball.

39:28.434 --> 39:30.168
It's, like, an indie film.

39:30.201 --> 39:32.438
Go on.

39:32.471 --> 39:35.073
This rookie cop
who has no family of his own

39:35.106 --> 39:38.577
ends up saving the lives
of this mother and daughter,

39:38.610 --> 39:42.047
and during that he ends up
feeling this connection to them

39:42.080 --> 39:43.615
and he feels
responsible for them.

39:43.649 --> 39:45.451
He gets really attached.

39:45.484 --> 39:47.018
Do that.
Do that one.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.454
No.
Yeah.

39:48.487 --> 39:50.422
Indie films are--
they're tricky.

39:50.456 --> 39:51.857
There's no money involved,

39:51.890 --> 39:54.793
and plus, no one
actually goes to see them,

39:54.826 --> 39:56.662
and the character
is, like, super tough.

39:56.695 --> 39:58.063
It's really challenging.

39:58.096 --> 39:59.030
Perfect.

40:01.833 --> 40:03.168
I mean, the script is great.

40:03.201 --> 40:05.537
It's really dark and honest,

40:05.571 --> 40:07.806
but, no, the critics
will rip it apart.

40:07.839 --> 40:10.642
It's not what my fans want.
And there's no money.

40:10.676 --> 40:13.545
Plus, it conflicts
with the reality show anyway.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.681
Good. Do it.

40:15.714 --> 40:17.483
It'll show
another side of you.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.150
What other side?

40:19.184 --> 40:21.920
Anything other than
this annoying one.

40:21.953 --> 40:24.122
( SIGHS )

40:27.793 --> 40:29.227
You know,
it's not easy for me

40:29.260 --> 40:32.130
to open up to you like this,
to let my shields down,

40:32.163 --> 40:36.935
so when I start to trust you,
you just lash out at me.

40:36.968 --> 40:41.540
I just feel like
I can't trust anyone.

40:41.573 --> 40:42.874
Oh, my gosh!
I'm so sorry.

40:42.908 --> 40:43.875
I just...

40:43.909 --> 40:45.477
Acting, boom.

40:45.511 --> 40:47.112
See, I'm pretty good at this.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.116
Do it.

40:51.149 --> 40:52.217
Yeah, maybe.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.123
GRANDMA:
And Sophie and Drake.

41:03.962 --> 41:05.163
Hey, Gran.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.898
Oh, happy birthday!

41:06.932 --> 41:08.800
Oh, no,
she doesn't want that.

41:08.834 --> 41:10.936
I know.
It's weird, right?

41:10.969 --> 41:11.937
Totally.

41:11.970 --> 41:13.539
Gran, we need to talk.

41:13.572 --> 41:15.206
Oh, okay.

41:15.240 --> 41:17.943
It's kind of important.

41:17.976 --> 41:19.911
Oh.

41:19.945 --> 41:23.481
Uh, Georgina, could you
take care of these?

41:24.683 --> 41:26.652
Hey, beautiful.

41:26.685 --> 41:27.385
Hi.

41:31.256 --> 41:32.691
Okay.

41:32.724 --> 41:34.259
Hi.
Hi.

41:34.292 --> 41:35.827
Who are you?

41:35.861 --> 41:39.665
Oh, uh, I am Sophie's
boyfriend Englebert.

41:39.698 --> 41:42.801
Oh. You are very handsome.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.202
Like a woman.

41:44.235 --> 41:46.104
Okay.
GRANDMA: Shush!

41:46.137 --> 41:48.273
I'm getting to know Englebert.

41:48.306 --> 41:50.308
Hmph.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.677
Where were we?

41:51.710 --> 41:53.311
Oh, Sophie's birthday.

41:53.344 --> 41:54.946
We should make cupcakes.

41:54.980 --> 41:56.915
Yes! I love you.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.283
Stop.

41:58.316 --> 42:00.218
She has always been like this.

42:00.251 --> 42:02.253
I know. She's trying
to make me not like her.

42:02.287 --> 42:03.254
Is it working?

42:03.288 --> 42:04.656
No, it's adorable.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.291
Gran, I need to
talk to you about Star.

42:06.324 --> 42:08.059
Sophie,
where are your manners?

42:08.093 --> 42:09.828
I am getting to know
your friend.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.997
Now, what's your real name?

42:12.030 --> 42:13.899
Gran, Drake.
Drake, Gran.

42:13.932 --> 42:16.668
Now can we please
talk about Star?

42:16.702 --> 42:19.605
Dad said Star's haunted
and you said that Star's magic.

42:19.638 --> 42:21.072
What do you guys mean?

42:21.106 --> 42:23.675
Well, your father
is a weirdo.

42:23.709 --> 42:25.243
SOPHIE: Yeah, but you said
Star was magic.

42:27.345 --> 42:30.916
Why?
Did something happen?

42:30.949 --> 42:33.084
Yeah, she kidnapped me.
Sophie!

42:33.118 --> 42:36.021
Like, a lot.
Like, a lot, a lot.
Not me-- Star.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.056
Every time we get away
from each other, he poofs.

42:38.089 --> 42:39.625
Uh, teleports.

42:39.658 --> 42:40.959
Teleports...
DRAKE: Thank you.

42:40.992 --> 42:43.829
Back into the trunk
of the car.

42:43.862 --> 42:44.996
Okay.

42:45.030 --> 42:46.798
Okay?

42:46.832 --> 42:48.133
Yes.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.735
Okay.

42:49.768 --> 42:51.970
You seem surprisingly okay
about this.

42:52.003 --> 42:53.705
Okay, fine.
I'll show you.

42:53.739 --> 42:55.841
Oh, honey,
you don't need to.

42:55.874 --> 42:57.776
Yeah, we don't need to.
Yeah, we need to show her.

42:57.809 --> 42:59.645
But it hurts.
SOPHIE: Okay, fine.

43:06.317 --> 43:07.819
I don't want you
scaring people.

43:07.853 --> 43:08.987
Right.
Go.

43:10.856 --> 43:12.691
Where's she going?

43:12.724 --> 43:15.794
Um, it's actually
where I'm going.

43:15.827 --> 43:17.663
See you in a sec.

43:26.104 --> 43:27.773
( CAR STARTS )

43:53.364 --> 43:56.101
Okay. Star's magic.

43:56.134 --> 43:58.369
Yeah, I got that.

43:58.403 --> 44:00.271
Well, I didn't know
if he knew.

44:00.305 --> 44:03.842
And I didn't want to
have to take him out

44:03.875 --> 44:06.411
since we were telling secrets
if he didn't know.

44:06.444 --> 44:08.313
Take me out?
You would do that?

44:08.346 --> 44:10.048
Seriously, Sophie,
what is wrong with your family?

44:10.081 --> 44:11.883
Gran, what do we do?

44:11.917 --> 44:13.451
I can't deal
with this anymore.
It's driving me crazy.

44:13.484 --> 44:15.020
It's been super fun
for me, though.

44:15.053 --> 44:16.221
So what do we do?

44:16.254 --> 44:18.790
( SIGHS )
I don't know.

44:20.792 --> 44:22.894
That's it?
You don't know?

44:22.928 --> 44:26.264
Well, why did you say
that you thought Star was magic?

44:26.297 --> 44:29.835
Oh, that's a good story.

44:29.868 --> 44:30.769
Wait.

44:33.338 --> 44:34.840
Okay, go.

44:34.873 --> 44:37.042
Okay, so there I am,
20 years old,

44:37.075 --> 44:39.945
driving
in this terrible snowstorm

44:39.978 --> 44:42.848
with the windshield wipers
valiantly fighting

44:42.881 --> 44:45.316
against this torrent of snow.

44:45.350 --> 44:47.218
I could see how
you two are related.
Shut up!

44:47.252 --> 44:48.386
And then,
in this white curtain,

44:48.419 --> 44:52.190
I saw a hitchhiker
standing alone,

44:52.223 --> 44:56.261
destined for a lonely,
frozen death...

44:56.294 --> 44:58.730
Gran, you picked up
a hitchhiker?

44:58.764 --> 45:02.801
Eh, it was the '60s.
It's what we did.

45:02.834 --> 45:04.269
Plus, I thought
it was a woman.

45:04.302 --> 45:05.904
Was it?

45:05.937 --> 45:09.040
No, it was an ancient man
with a thick accent.

45:09.074 --> 45:11.276
His name was Samir.

45:11.309 --> 45:12.978
And I asked him
if he was okay,

45:13.011 --> 45:15.781
and he said he needed
to get to Chicago.

45:16.915 --> 45:18.850
He was on a quest.

45:18.884 --> 45:20.852
For what?

45:20.886 --> 45:25.991
His brother was going to
take him to get a hot dog.

45:26.024 --> 45:27.993
Spooky.

45:28.026 --> 45:30.095
Okay, so you're on
your way to Chicago.

45:30.128 --> 45:31.329
Then what happened?

45:31.362 --> 45:34.099
So I picked him up
and he told me

45:34.132 --> 45:36.902
how he came to America
on a steamship

45:36.935 --> 45:41.973
and how he liked walking,
but he was amazed by my car.

45:42.007 --> 45:46.177
He loved the vibe
and the life of it,

45:46.211 --> 45:50.015
and he was so interesting
and mystical

45:50.048 --> 45:54.953
that I didn't even realize
we were running out of gas.

45:54.986 --> 45:59.858
And then suddenly,
poof, we stopped.

45:59.891 --> 46:02.127
Stranded in the snow.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.062
Wow.
Wow.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.264
So I looked to him
and he looked to me

46:06.297 --> 46:10.001
and he said, "I got this."

46:10.035 --> 46:11.536
And he went around
to the trunk

46:11.569 --> 46:16.274
and he opened it
and took out a gas can.

46:16.307 --> 46:17.575
SOPHIE:
A gas can?

46:17.608 --> 46:20.545
There was no gas can
in that trunk.

46:20.578 --> 46:22.213
No way!

46:22.247 --> 46:26.217
He filled it up,
and we drove to Chicago.

46:26.251 --> 46:27.385
And then?

46:27.418 --> 46:31.356
I guess he went
and had a hot dog.

46:31.389 --> 46:32.958
I don't know.

46:32.991 --> 46:34.059
That's it?

46:34.092 --> 46:36.962
Magic gas
and an exotic magic man?

46:36.995 --> 46:38.830
Well, a wizard,
really.

46:38.864 --> 46:40.832
Oh, wizard's good.

46:40.866 --> 46:42.267
What about warlock?
It sounds cooler.

46:42.300 --> 46:43.601
Hm.

46:43.634 --> 46:47.005
Okay, an exotic warlock
filled up your gas tank

46:47.038 --> 46:48.406
with magic gas...

46:48.439 --> 46:50.408
And got us to Chicago.

46:50.441 --> 46:52.543
And you got to Chicago.
That's amazing.

46:52.577 --> 46:54.445
No, that's not amazing,
that's weird,

46:54.479 --> 46:56.614
and it doesn't even
explain anything.

46:56.647 --> 47:00.418
Well, if we could explain it,
it wouldn't be magic.

47:00.451 --> 47:03.088
That's a good point, Sophie.

47:03.121 --> 47:07.125
See, Star knew
what I needed,

47:07.158 --> 47:09.961
what I needed most,

47:09.995 --> 47:11.529
what my heart wished for.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.367
Wish?

47:18.203 --> 47:21.339
You made a wish,
didn't you?

47:21.372 --> 47:22.874
What did you wish for?

47:22.908 --> 47:24.175
Uh...

47:24.209 --> 47:26.044
You wished for something.

47:26.077 --> 47:27.512
Wait, did you wish for me?

47:27.545 --> 47:29.414
No. Yes, I mean, no.

47:29.447 --> 47:30.882
Why me?

47:30.916 --> 47:32.884
Don't get excited.
I had your picture.

47:32.918 --> 47:36.487
Oh, you're the boy
in the picture frame.

47:36.521 --> 47:38.389
That was a very good picture.

47:38.423 --> 47:41.292
The others were better,
but thank you.

47:41.326 --> 47:45.196
So you wished for him.
Ta-da!

47:45.230 --> 47:46.297
Ta-da!

47:46.331 --> 47:49.901
No, I mean, yes,
but not exactly.

47:49.935 --> 47:52.971
Star knows exactly
what you want.

47:54.539 --> 47:57.175
Oh, that's it.
What?

47:57.208 --> 48:00.045
I wished for you to go
to the dance with me.

48:00.078 --> 48:01.212
There's a dance?

48:01.246 --> 48:02.948
Yeah,
a Valentine's Day dance.

48:02.981 --> 48:04.182
Wait, is it Valentine's Day?

48:04.215 --> 48:06.417
SOPHIE:
How do you not know that?

48:06.451 --> 48:08.186
It's kind of weird
that your birthday's
on Valentine's Day.

48:08.219 --> 48:10.221
Oh, yeah.
It's been a joy
my entire life.

48:10.255 --> 48:12.023
Full of love and wonderment.
You know what, Grandma?

48:12.057 --> 48:13.959
I'm going to break down
that wall of negativity.

48:13.992 --> 48:16.394
You wished for a dance.

48:16.427 --> 48:19.030
Hmm, doesn't sound like you.

48:19.064 --> 48:21.566
Yeah, so I guess you'll
have to take me to the dance.

48:21.599 --> 48:23.101
Is it, like,
a square dance?

48:23.134 --> 48:24.302
No, it's a girl-ask-g--

48:24.335 --> 48:25.536
What? No.

48:25.570 --> 48:27.672
Where do you think we live?

48:27.705 --> 48:29.340
Well, okay, honey.

48:29.374 --> 48:31.242
Maybe it was just a dance,
but I don't know.

48:31.276 --> 48:35.280
Star...
Star really knows.

48:35.313 --> 48:36.314
Nope.

48:36.347 --> 48:38.649
The dance,
that was my wish.

48:38.683 --> 48:41.486
Because it's not just
what you say, you know?

48:41.519 --> 48:43.654
It's what's in your heart.

48:43.688 --> 48:46.424
Yeah, I wished for him
to go to the dance with me

48:46.457 --> 48:48.659
so I can make Emily
and Aaron look stupid.

48:48.693 --> 48:50.461
Wow, I'm touched.

48:50.495 --> 48:52.463
Do you want to
go home or not?
Yes. Let's do it.

48:52.497 --> 48:54.032
Okay. Then we go
to the dance.
Okay.

48:54.065 --> 48:56.301
Honey, wait. I-- I...

48:56.334 --> 48:58.569
Honey, wait.

48:58.603 --> 49:01.139
No, we have to get him
clothes for the dance.

49:01.172 --> 49:02.307
I know, but listen.

49:02.340 --> 49:04.209
I don't think
you understand.

49:04.242 --> 49:05.543
No, I got it.

49:05.576 --> 49:09.114
You needed gas for Star,
and Star gave you gas.

49:09.147 --> 49:11.516
( SNICKERS )

49:11.549 --> 49:12.750
I needed a date,

49:12.783 --> 49:14.452
and Star gave me
Mr. Mature over here.

49:14.485 --> 49:17.622
Well...
She said Star gave her gas.

49:17.655 --> 49:18.990
Let's go.
All right, let's roll.

49:19.024 --> 49:19.724
Mm-hmm.

49:24.329 --> 49:26.364
Oh, sweetie.

49:27.732 --> 49:30.501
Star gave me
so much more than that.

49:35.773 --> 49:37.408
Yawn.

49:37.442 --> 49:38.543
DRAKE:
All right, all right.

49:39.744 --> 49:41.179

49:41.212 --> 49:43.581
DRAKE:
Yep, I look awesome.

49:43.614 --> 49:45.383
Okay, show me.

49:45.416 --> 49:47.385
DRAKE: One sec. Just putting
on the final touch.

49:47.418 --> 49:50.021
You need to spray your hair?
DRAKE: That's very funny.

49:50.055 --> 49:53.424
No. I'm putting on boots
and they're really hard.

49:53.458 --> 49:55.526
Boots? Wait.
Why do you need boots?

49:55.560 --> 49:57.162
DRAKE: Uh, 'cause it's part
of the outfit.

49:57.195 --> 49:58.563
Hurry up, Englebert.

49:58.596 --> 50:00.331
DRAKE: I shall not answer
to Englebert.

50:00.365 --> 50:01.666
Do you know what?
Are you ready?

50:01.699 --> 50:03.000
Yes.

50:04.235 --> 50:06.237

( CHUCKLES )
Got you!

50:14.612 --> 50:17.082
( CHUCKLES )
You thought I was being...

50:17.115 --> 50:18.583
Is it the hat?
Is the hat too much?

50:18.616 --> 50:20.185
Yeah, yeah.
It was the hat.

50:20.218 --> 50:21.319
And the boots?

50:21.352 --> 50:22.553
All of it.
You look like Huck Finn.

50:22.587 --> 50:24.222
Is that how
you think we dress?

50:24.255 --> 50:26.257
Well, I don't know.
You dress like a witch...

50:26.291 --> 50:29.627
ever fashionable celebrity
who wears too much black.

50:29.660 --> 50:30.728
Yeah.

50:30.761 --> 50:32.463
This is how I like to dress.

50:32.497 --> 50:33.464
Since when?

50:35.833 --> 50:37.602
Since always.

50:37.635 --> 50:39.404
Anyway, we're not
talking about me.

50:39.437 --> 50:41.739
Pick some normal clothes.
Okay, fine.

50:41.772 --> 50:43.841
But just so you know, these are
normal to a lot of people.

50:43.874 --> 50:45.710
And I will change because
you clearly have an issue

50:45.743 --> 50:47.678
with this whole situation,
but let's be honest--

50:47.712 --> 50:49.380
I can rock this, right?

50:49.414 --> 50:51.582
Yeah.
Yeah, sure, fine.

50:51.616 --> 50:53.718
So I can wear it?
No! Pick something else.

50:53.751 --> 50:55.720
You look like
you're going to a hoedown.

DRAKE: No problem.

your wallet and you're
doing me a favor,

this is a gift.

that this is

51:09.867 --> 51:11.202
Yeah. So?

51:11.236 --> 51:12.737
Well, you haven't
asked me yet.

51:12.770 --> 51:14.572
Oh, right.

51:14.605 --> 51:16.574
Okay, ready?
Brrrr, bla-bla-bla.

51:16.607 --> 51:19.244
Okay, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, and action.

51:19.277 --> 51:21.279
Will you go
to the dance with me?

51:21.312 --> 51:22.813
All right, cut.
That was terrible.

51:22.847 --> 51:24.849
At least try to be sincere,
like a little genuine.

51:24.882 --> 51:26.551
I know you have it
in you. Ready?

51:28.153 --> 51:31.088
Please, will you go
to the dance with me?

51:32.323 --> 51:33.291
Nailed it.

51:33.324 --> 51:34.692
( GIGGLES )

51:36.761 --> 51:38.596
Great, I think
they're following us.

51:38.629 --> 51:40.565
What's up?
Hey, Englebert!

51:43.734 --> 51:46.171
Are you sure I don't
know you from somewhere?

51:46.204 --> 51:47.872
You look so familiar.

51:47.905 --> 51:49.274
The guy from the movies?

51:49.307 --> 51:50.741
Yeah.
The handsome one?

51:50.775 --> 51:52.577
Totally.

51:52.610 --> 51:54.645
The one in that one with
the girl who's, like, a pain,

51:54.679 --> 51:56.481
but then she realizes
he's awesome.

51:56.514 --> 51:58.216
Which one?
They're all like that.

51:58.249 --> 52:00.285
Oh, what about the one
where the guy goes to Europe

52:00.318 --> 52:02.253
and falls in love
with the Italian princess,

52:02.287 --> 52:04.522
and what he doesn't know
is that she's actually
switched places

52:04.555 --> 52:06.624
with the poor,
yet beautiful, homeless girl,

52:06.657 --> 52:08.859
and they all learn how to love
and how to laugh about life...

52:08.893 --> 52:10.328
Yeah, totally.
That one. That guy.

52:10.361 --> 52:11.429
Yes! That's not me.

52:11.462 --> 52:14.332
Oh. You look just like him.

52:14.365 --> 52:18.836
Yeah, I think it's
my Dutch-Irish-French-
Canadian blood.

52:18.869 --> 52:21.239
Oh.
That is so exotic.

52:21.272 --> 52:22.173
DRAKE:
Yeah.

52:23.974 --> 52:25.276
Hi.

52:25.310 --> 52:26.911
EMILY:
Oh, hi.

52:26.944 --> 52:28.879
Hi.

52:28.913 --> 52:29.814
Hi.

52:31.216 --> 52:32.583
'Sup.

52:32.617 --> 52:35.353
Well, this was nice.
Let's go.

52:35.386 --> 52:36.821
Well, that's all right.

52:36.854 --> 52:38.256
You can leave.
We'll take Englebert home.

52:38.289 --> 52:39.390
Who?

52:39.424 --> 52:41.392
You.
Right. I'm Englebert.

52:41.426 --> 52:43.494
Then it's settled.
See you, Sophie.

52:43.528 --> 52:46.964
No, let's, like,
all hang out together.

52:46.997 --> 52:48.566
GIRLS: Um...
Uhhh.

52:48.599 --> 52:50.568
Do you guys have
a soda fountain
in these parts?

52:50.601 --> 52:51.702
A what?

52:51.736 --> 52:53.871
He thinks we live
in 1920s Alabama.

52:53.904 --> 52:56.674
Okay, honestly, the whole
hipster-versus-cheerleader
animosity thing--

52:56.707 --> 52:58.343
gotta be honest, though--
it doesn't work anymore.

52:58.376 --> 52:59.777
Audience thinks
it's so clichÃ©.

52:59.810 --> 53:02.247
So let's all go out
and grab some sundaes.

53:03.348 --> 53:04.382
Yeah.

53:04.415 --> 53:05.383
Okay, yeah, let's.

53:05.416 --> 53:06.517
Wait, really?

53:06.551 --> 53:07.718
Okay.
( GIGGLES )

53:07.752 --> 53:08.886
Cool!

53:08.919 --> 53:10.255
Let me just grab my car.

53:10.288 --> 53:11.989
Sweet.
Ice cream party!

53:12.022 --> 53:13.424
Yeah!

53:18.263 --> 53:18.963
Oh, uh...

53:20.665 --> 53:21.766
Uh, wait.

53:21.799 --> 53:23.768
Do you guys like magic tricks?

53:23.801 --> 53:25.370
I guess.
Cool!

53:25.403 --> 53:27.872
Okay, so close your eyes.
Just close your eyes.

53:27.905 --> 53:30.241
Okay.
And on the count of three.

53:30.275 --> 53:31.742
One, two, three.

53:31.776 --> 53:33.678
Um, just tell us when.

53:35.280 --> 53:36.647
Should we open them?

53:36.681 --> 53:38.516
I don't know.
I don't want to ruin it.

53:38.549 --> 53:39.817
Okay.
Let's wait.

53:42.487 --> 53:43.721
DRAKE:
You did that on purpose!

53:43.754 --> 53:45.490
I know.
I was there.

53:45.523 --> 53:46.791
They could have
seen me teleport.

53:46.824 --> 53:48.293
So? Great.

53:48.326 --> 53:50.428
Try explaining that
to everyone at school.

53:50.461 --> 53:52.863
Lucky for you
I took an improv class
so I could cover for us.

53:52.897 --> 53:55.032
Super lucky.
Will you let me out?

53:55.065 --> 53:57.735
No. You need a time-out.
No, you need a time-out.

53:57.768 --> 54:00.605
Fine, I'll take mine
up here.

54:00.638 --> 54:02.373
So we're not
grabbing sundaes?

54:02.407 --> 54:04.975
I'd rather wear pastel
pink ribbons in my hair.

54:05.009 --> 54:06.977
That might look nice.

54:07.011 --> 54:09.347
So why are you so mad?
I'm allowed to be mad.

54:09.380 --> 54:10.748
Well, you shouldn't
keep it inside.

54:10.781 --> 54:12.817
That's bad karma, man.
Bad vibes.

( SIRENS )

54:17.922 --> 54:19.557
See?

54:19.590 --> 54:21.359
Seriously?

54:21.392 --> 54:23.027
Do you ever stop?

54:26.931 --> 54:28.699
Delores,
I'm on Churchill Drive

54:28.733 --> 54:30.501
with a temperamental
teenage girl.

You want backup?

54:31.536 --> 54:32.770
Nah.

54:34.672 --> 54:35.573
Ugh!

54:37.107 --> 54:38.609
Stand by on that backup.

Don't say anything.

54:45.883 --> 54:48.453
Sophie, you're supposed
to stay in the car.

54:48.486 --> 54:49.887
Hi, Tommy.
You want me to get back in?

54:49.920 --> 54:51.055
Nah, the moment's ruined.

54:51.088 --> 54:52.423
You steal your grandma's car?

54:52.457 --> 54:53.424
No, she gave it to me.

54:53.458 --> 54:54.659
Ugh.

54:54.692 --> 54:55.760
For my birthday.

54:55.793 --> 54:57.762
( CHUCKLES )
I mean, awesome.

54:57.795 --> 54:59.797
Happy birthday!

She doesn't like that.

55:02.400 --> 55:03.634
Sophie?

55:03.668 --> 55:05.570
I know.

55:05.603 --> 55:07.905
Sophie,
your car is talking.

55:07.938 --> 55:09.340
I know.

55:09.374 --> 55:10.941
Sophie, I take
a lot of cop classes

55:10.975 --> 55:12.777
and I watch a lot of "CSI,"

55:12.810 --> 55:14.512
so I know
how this world works

55:14.545 --> 55:17.415
and I can tell you your car
should not be talking.

55:17.448 --> 55:18.916
DRAKE:
Unless they're magic.

55:18.949 --> 55:20.851
Exactly.
Pop the trunk.

55:23.954 --> 55:24.689
What's up?

55:26.424 --> 55:28.359
Sophie, there's a body
in your trunk.

55:28.393 --> 55:29.794
You, out.

55:29.827 --> 55:31.362
Okay.

55:31.396 --> 55:32.663
I pulled you over

55:32.697 --> 55:33.898
because your left taillight
was flickering.

55:33.931 --> 55:35.533
I guess now we know why.

55:35.566 --> 55:36.934
Sorry.

55:36.967 --> 55:38.803
Sophie, why is your boyfriend
in the trunk?

55:38.836 --> 55:39.870
He's not my boyfriend.

55:39.904 --> 55:41.138
Sophie?

55:41.171 --> 55:43.007
I don't know.
He keeps jumping in there.

55:43.040 --> 55:46.043
Sophie, if you lie to me,
I'm legally allowed to tase you.

55:46.076 --> 55:47.778
Wait, is that true?

55:47.812 --> 55:50.815
No. No one lets me
tase them.

55:50.848 --> 55:52.650
How cool would it be
if you opened up the trunk

55:52.683 --> 55:54.552
and I was just, like, dead?

55:54.585 --> 55:55.986
You know, and Sophie,
whom you've known since...

55:56.020 --> 55:57.722
Since I was little.
Yes, since she was little,

55:57.755 --> 55:59.624
is actually a serial killer,
like a high school one?

55:59.657 --> 56:00.791
Shall we do this again?
Yes!

56:00.825 --> 56:02.092
Sweet.
Boop.

Aw, what's in the trunk?
What's in the trunk?

Yup, okay.
Yup.

56:27.918 --> 56:29.587
That was awesome!

56:29.620 --> 56:30.955
Just so you know,
there's a little lever here

56:30.988 --> 56:32.523
that pops the trunk
from the inside.

56:32.557 --> 56:33.991
Just in case
you get kidnapped again.

56:34.024 --> 56:35.693
Oh, sick.
Good to know.

56:35.726 --> 56:37.628
Okay, admit it-- that would be
a good movie, right?

56:37.662 --> 56:39.530
Like, I'd see that movie.
I would see that movie.

56:39.564 --> 56:40.831
I wouldn't.

56:40.865 --> 56:41.899
She's a little um...
Critical.

56:41.932 --> 56:43.100
It's the age.
Yeah.

56:43.133 --> 56:44.669
Sophie, when you
get to be my age...

56:44.702 --> 56:46.437
You're one year older.

56:46.471 --> 56:47.938
When you get to be my age,
you see things differently.

56:47.972 --> 56:49.139
I know you.
You're that movie guy.

56:49.173 --> 56:50.508
Yeah.

56:50.541 --> 56:51.509
Oh, so we're
telling people now?

57:00.050 --> 57:02.019
Oh, good choice. She knows
all the coolest places.

57:02.052 --> 57:04.555
I mean, you find her
in really odd locations

57:04.589 --> 57:07.157
and it seems really basic,
but through her eyes
it looks awesome.

really great photos.

it means shush.

being a ninja.

an amazing ninja.

what this means.

Aw, see?
She does smile.

It just takes a little effort,
but it's worth it.

57:37.822 --> 57:39.690
All right, you two, go.
Get out of here.

Yes, yes!
No way.

57:57.074 --> 57:59.176
I want to see your photos.

57:59.209 --> 58:01.278
Get used to disappointment
because you're never
going to see them.

58:01.311 --> 58:03.581
Why?
Because.

58:03.614 --> 58:05.249
Well, that is
a pretty good reason.

58:07.585 --> 58:09.186
So why'd you ditch Emily?

58:09.219 --> 58:10.821
She was messing with me.

58:10.855 --> 58:12.289
She wanted to grab
ice cream.

No, she didn't.
Trust me.

58:16.894 --> 58:18.529
I know what you meant,

58:18.563 --> 58:20.064
and I really think she
wanted to hang out with you.

58:20.097 --> 58:21.766
Yeah, you don't know her.

58:21.799 --> 58:23.768

and I bet if you go to--

58:23.801 --> 58:26.036
what is it,
Benny's right now--
she'd be there.

58:26.070 --> 58:28.172
I'll bet you $23,000,000
she's not there.

58:28.205 --> 58:29.807
I'll bet you
something better.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.743
If she's there,
I get to see your photos.

58:32.777 --> 58:34.044
And if she's not?

58:34.078 --> 58:36.581
I will shut up
for one whole hour.

Oh, done!

58:50.595 --> 58:52.830

It's a trap.

seriously wrong with you.

Sophie and Englebert were going
to meet us here for sundaes."

when I get home.

59:08.245 --> 59:10.114
"Oh, I really hope
that they like
banana splits

because I love
banana splits.

I think we should
get one hot fudge sundae
and one banana split sundae.

59:14.885 --> 59:17.087
Golly, I am nervous."

59:17.121 --> 59:19.056
SOPHIE:
"You just want to meet
that guy she's with.

59:19.089 --> 59:21.859
It's not like you care
about Sophie at all.
At all!"

59:21.892 --> 59:24.695
DRAKE:
"Or I just feel really bad
about asking you to the dance.

59:24.729 --> 59:26.964
I want to make amends
to my former best friend."

59:26.997 --> 59:28.999
"That's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

59:29.033 --> 59:32.369
Almost as believable
as that movie with that
terrible actor Drake."

59:32.402 --> 59:34.705
Wait, that hurts a lot.

59:34.739 --> 59:36.373
"And I just want Sophie
to be happy, you know,

59:36.406 --> 59:38.075
because I feel like
she thinks I'm a villain

59:38.108 --> 59:39.910
because she's
such a drama queen,

59:39.944 --> 59:42.046
but I'm just
a normal teenage girl
trying to make their way

59:42.079 --> 59:43.714
through this dark world
of Internet chat rooms

59:43.748 --> 59:45.650
and fat-free food,
you know? Oh!"

59:47.151 --> 59:48.118
Oh, no!

59:48.152 --> 59:51.321
Uh, oh, perfect.

59:55.826 --> 59:57.094
Uh-oh.

'Sup?

59:58.295 --> 59:59.196
Gotta go.

01:00:07.905 --> 01:00:10.040
DRAKE:
No! What happened?
She wanted to see you.

01:00:10.074 --> 01:00:11.642
I panicked.

01:00:11.676 --> 01:00:14.111
( LAUGHTER )
What's so funny?

01:00:14.144 --> 01:00:16.380
Now you have to show me
your photos. Ha ha.

01:00:16.413 --> 01:00:18.115
Oh, yeah.
So funny.

01:00:18.148 --> 01:00:20.718
Well, you're the one
in the trunk.

01:00:20.751 --> 01:00:21.652
Oh.

01:00:32.162 --> 01:00:35.299
Okay, okay.
I'll show you,
but first...

01:00:35.332 --> 01:00:37.201
I have to beat you there.
Wait, wait, wait!

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:44.308
Yeah, I didn't--
I didn't think that through.

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:45.275
Yeah.

01:00:47.344 --> 01:00:49.346
Ha!
Oh, no! Stop.

01:00:57.421 --> 01:00:58.856
Wait, you write, too?

01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:00.424
No. No, no, no, no.
That's awesome.

01:01:00.457 --> 01:01:02.259
( GROANS )
Okay. Okay.

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:04.028
This is just
something I do, all right?

01:01:04.061 --> 01:01:05.429
It's not like
I'm professional or anything.

01:01:05.462 --> 01:01:07.397
Yeah, you don't
have to pre-empt it.

01:01:07.431 --> 01:01:09.934
I just don't want you to think
this is the best I can do.

01:01:09.967 --> 01:01:12.202
Well, I appreciate you
lowering my expectations,

01:01:12.236 --> 01:01:15.472
but I promise you
I'll expect nothing more
than badly lit selfies

01:01:15.505 --> 01:01:17.775
not even good enough
to post on the interwebs.

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:21.712
O-Okay, if you promise.

01:01:21.746 --> 01:01:23.113
Cool.

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:24.148
Ha. I lied!

01:01:24.181 --> 01:01:25.816
That's my bed.

01:01:27.451 --> 01:01:30.154
No.
Wait, stop.
Stop! Stop it!

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:34.324
Whoa!
Okay, these...

01:01:35.993 --> 01:01:37.728
These-- these
are really good.

01:01:37.762 --> 01:01:39.263
I have more at school.

01:01:41.165 --> 01:01:42.399
These are amazing.

01:01:43.834 --> 01:01:45.770
Yeah, I mean, they're okay.

01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:47.805
Well, you put them up
for a reason, didn't you?

01:01:47.838 --> 01:01:50.374
I had to cover up
all these stickers
I put up in fifth grade.

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:52.042
I would never
show these to anyone.

01:01:53.811 --> 01:01:55.846
You know, I put myself
out there all the time.

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:59.049
Just part of being an artist.

01:02:00.417 --> 01:02:02.052
These are really good.

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:04.454
You should take that risk.

01:02:09.359 --> 01:02:11.962
Okay, so how does it end?

01:02:11.996 --> 01:02:13.197
What?

01:02:13.230 --> 01:02:15.032
Like, the story--
how does the story end?

01:02:16.133 --> 01:02:18.202
They're just pictures.

01:02:18.235 --> 01:02:20.537
I'm in front of the camera
all the time.

01:02:20.570 --> 01:02:22.139
I look at storyboards
every day.

01:02:26.343 --> 01:02:27.377
SOPHIE:
That's a tree.

01:02:28.813 --> 01:02:30.547
It's an establishing shot.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.383
So we start off on a forest.
It's very dark, mysterious.

01:02:33.417 --> 01:02:36.420
We pan down to the girl
who's alone

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:39.890
and she's looking for
something or someone.

01:02:39.924 --> 01:02:43.527
And she's on an adventure
and she meets these beasts

01:02:43.560 --> 01:02:45.429
who are very scary,
by the way...

01:02:45.462 --> 01:02:48.032
but she sees the beauty
in them, so she tames them.

01:02:48.065 --> 01:02:51.401
We pan down
and we're on the sea,
and it's very scary,

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:54.905
very relentless,
very mysterious.

01:02:54.939 --> 01:02:56.406
This is cool.
This is really fun.

01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.875
We should-- we should
finish it, though.

01:02:57.908 --> 01:02:59.509
We should
finish off the story.

01:02:59.543 --> 01:03:01.812
We should do pictures
tomorrow.

01:03:01.846 --> 01:03:04.348
SOPHIE: Yeah, well,
this is not the sea.
This is a lake.

01:03:04.381 --> 01:03:06.116
It doesn't matter what
you're taking a picture of.

01:03:06.150 --> 01:03:08.552
It just matters what
you're showing the audience.

01:03:08.585 --> 01:03:10.154
Agree to disagree.

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:12.189
I agree that you
are disagreeable.

been working on that?

I think since this morning.

01:03:19.429 --> 01:03:21.331
You're lucky, though.

inspired by something real.

01:03:25.369 --> 01:03:26.837
( SIGHS )
It's been so long

01:03:26.871 --> 01:03:28.338
since I've been
in the real world.

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:29.940
That's why
this has been so cool.

01:03:31.441 --> 01:03:33.978
I feel very inspired.
I have all these ideas.

01:03:34.011 --> 01:03:36.446
Yeah, you could
use all those ideas
on your new reality show.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.348
Mm-hmm.
We'll see.

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:41.318
Oh, I found more pictures.

01:03:45.389 --> 01:03:46.957
Who's she?

01:03:46.991 --> 01:03:47.892
That's my mom.

01:03:49.994 --> 01:03:51.428
She died a couple years ago.

01:03:55.966 --> 01:03:58.135
Sorry.

01:03:58.168 --> 01:04:00.004
It's-- it's okay.
I'm good.

01:04:02.039 --> 01:04:03.373
I'm really sorry
that happened to you.

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:07.077
Yeah.

01:04:10.047 --> 01:04:11.648
Um. Okay.

01:04:11.681 --> 01:04:14.151
So are we going to figure out
what I'm wearing to this dance?

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:17.121
Oh, um,
I'm not letting this go,

01:04:17.154 --> 01:04:18.622
because if we're
going to be roommates,

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:20.991
there's going to be
some changes around here.

01:04:21.025 --> 01:04:23.327
I hope you know that,
because I'm accustomed
to a certain lifestyle

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:25.095
that includes
a lot of attention

01:04:25.129 --> 01:04:26.897
and lots of opportunities
for make-believe.

01:04:26.931 --> 01:04:28.232
We're not going
to be roommates.

01:04:28.265 --> 01:04:30.367

your act together.

My dad's going to love this.

Is he a witch, too?

Oh, my gosh.
Oh, no, what's a male witch?

01:04:35.973 --> 01:04:37.674
It's a warlock. Is that--
Stop it!

a straw hat.

by the funeral parlor

off the hook!

SOPHIE:
Okay, come on.

01:07:45.329 --> 01:07:46.763
I'm sorry. I told you
I wouldn't do that.

01:07:46.796 --> 01:07:48.365
Oh, hey, what's up, man?
How's it going?

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:49.399
Come on.

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.636
Well, that went well.

01:07:52.669 --> 01:07:54.671
Yeah. How do you feel?
Do you feel any different?

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:56.106
I feel sweaty.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:57.607
But not like
you're gonna teleport?

01:07:57.641 --> 01:07:59.209

( GROANS )
No.

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.512
Crap. I don't know
how this works.

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:03.747
I mean, I brought you
to the dance.

01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:05.482
Yeah, I don't know
what it could be.

01:08:05.515 --> 01:08:07.551
Maybe we need to kiss?

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:09.186
Huh?

01:08:09.219 --> 01:08:10.787
I don't know, maybe
that's what I thought of

01:08:10.820 --> 01:08:12.256
when I made the wish.

01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:13.523
Oh, okay. I see.

01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:14.724
You want to kiss me,
don't you?

01:08:14.758 --> 01:08:16.260
Oh, my God!
I knew it!

01:08:18.895 --> 01:08:20.497
I've never done this
before, okay?

01:08:20.529 --> 01:08:21.798
So don't laugh.
It's okay.

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.233
Remember,
I just need to get home.

I don't know how to dance.

01:10:52.616 --> 01:10:54.284
Sophie?

01:10:54.318 --> 01:10:55.885
You said you were
a good dancer.

01:10:55.919 --> 01:10:57.787
Yeah, I thought I was.

01:10:57.821 --> 01:10:59.623
My agents told me that.

01:10:59.656 --> 01:11:01.825
A director told me that.
My co-stars told me that.

Those liars!

01:11:02.859 --> 01:11:05.295

We were having
so much fun back there.

01:11:08.698 --> 01:11:10.767
This is all your fault.

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.469
What is?

01:11:12.502 --> 01:11:14.904
You said that artists need
to put themselves out there,

01:11:14.938 --> 01:11:16.773
that they need to take risks.

01:11:16.806 --> 01:11:18.975
Yeah, and you just did that.
That was not easy.

01:11:19.008 --> 01:11:21.545
Everyone was laughing at me.

01:11:21.578 --> 01:11:23.046
You know, for someone
who hates this town,

01:11:23.079 --> 01:11:24.914
you seem to really care
about what people think.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.650
I don't care.
I just...

01:11:26.683 --> 01:11:28.585
You just what?
Just leave me alone!

01:11:28.618 --> 01:11:30.754
No. You just what?
I just want to go home, Drake.

01:11:30.787 --> 01:11:33.457
No, no.
Sophie, stop, please.

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:34.758
I-- I have a life.

01:11:34.791 --> 01:11:36.393
I have a job.
I have a career.

You're not the only one
in this right now.

01:11:38.662 --> 01:11:40.630
Know what happens
when I don't show up
for work one day?

01:11:40.664 --> 01:11:42.566
I get fired
and I lose my contract.

01:11:44.634 --> 01:11:48.705
The problem is I--
I have no control over
this situation.

01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:50.607
So, please, Sophie,
I need you.

01:11:52.008 --> 01:11:53.443
It was your wish, remember?

01:11:54.611 --> 01:11:55.512
Yeah.

01:11:56.780 --> 01:11:57.881
I suppose it was.

01:12:09.559 --> 01:12:11.961
What did you wish for?
Nothing!

01:12:11.995 --> 01:12:13.397
Are you kidding me?
I'm an actor.

01:12:13.430 --> 01:12:15.031
My whole job
is to figure people out,

01:12:15.064 --> 01:12:17.133
and I had you figured out
within five minutes.

01:12:17.166 --> 01:12:18.835
What is that
supposed to mean?

01:12:18.868 --> 01:12:20.370
What did you wish for?

01:12:20.404 --> 01:12:21.505
SOPHIE:
I told you.

01:12:21.538 --> 01:12:22.539
No, you told me
what you said.

01:12:22.572 --> 01:12:23.873
What did you actually want?

01:12:23.907 --> 01:12:25.609
I wanted someone
to take me to the dance.

01:12:25.642 --> 01:12:27.744
No, those are just words.
What did you actually want?

01:12:27.777 --> 01:12:30.146
I wanted you to be
my date to the dance.

01:12:30.179 --> 01:12:31.948
Me? You don't even know me.

01:12:31.981 --> 01:12:33.683
You could have asked
for Superman, too,

01:12:33.717 --> 01:12:35.885
but you didn't,
so what did you want?

01:12:35.919 --> 01:12:38.555
I-- I...
DRAKE: What did you want?

01:12:38.588 --> 01:12:41.658
I wanted someone
to like me, okay?

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:43.660
I wanted someone
to want to go with me,

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.028
to want to have fun with me,

01:12:45.061 --> 01:12:47.864
and to want to
take me to the dance.

01:12:47.897 --> 01:12:50.967
Sophie, a lot of people
like you.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.569
I like you.

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:54.438
Your family likes you.
That cupcake girl likes you.

01:12:54.471 --> 01:12:56.673
I'm pretty sure
even that Emily chick likes you.

01:12:58.708 --> 01:13:00.944
But it's really hard to see
if anyone actually likes you

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:02.612
if you don't like yourself,
isn't it?

You okay?
What? You're here?

01:13:23.199 --> 01:13:26.970
Yeah. Well, I didn't want
my baby alone on her
birthday weekend.

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:29.105
But Grandma said
you were at the dance.

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:30.039
Yeah.

01:13:31.174 --> 01:13:32.809
Was it fun?

01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:34.711
Not really.
Oh, that's too bad.

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:36.580
Those things always
look like so much fun.

01:13:36.613 --> 01:13:38.214
I always missed mine.
I was too busy working.

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.949
( SIGHS )
That makes more sense--

01:13:39.983 --> 01:13:42.519
make money, get out of
small towns and haunted cars.

01:13:42.552 --> 01:13:44.187
Shh!
It might hear you.

01:13:44.220 --> 01:13:47.056
It's back at the school.
Stupid haunted car.

01:13:47.090 --> 01:13:48.525
Oh, so you heard the story.

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:49.859
The tennis story.
The snow storm.

01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:50.927
What?
What?

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.996
The-- I was
a tennis instructor.

01:13:53.029 --> 01:13:55.565
It was back before
all the waffles.

01:13:55.599 --> 01:13:57.867
Um.
Shut up.
I'm telling a story.

01:13:57.901 --> 01:13:59.135
Come on.
Okay.

01:14:06.009 --> 01:14:08.678
So, one summer
I was a tennis instructor,

01:14:08.712 --> 01:14:10.647
and your mom
worked here at the diner.

01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.982
I worked during the day
and she worked at night.

01:14:13.016 --> 01:14:17.787
And, boy, your mom,
she was so beautiful.

01:14:17.821 --> 01:14:21.925
The highlight of my day was
seeing her in the parking lot

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:25.094
as she was getting to work
and I was leaving.

01:14:25.128 --> 01:14:29.098
And then one day I worked up
my courage to talk to her.

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:32.235
I'd practiced over
and over and over again.

01:14:32.268 --> 01:14:36.540
And I walked right up to her,
and you know what I said?

01:14:36.573 --> 01:14:37.674
What?

01:14:37.707 --> 01:14:38.942
Nothing.
I chickened out.

01:14:38.975 --> 01:14:40.877
No way!
Yep.

01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:43.880
I realized that we'd never
get to see each other--

01:14:43.913 --> 01:14:45.248
not the way that we worked--

01:14:45.281 --> 01:14:48.918
and it was better
not to get my hopes up,

01:14:48.952 --> 01:14:50.920
not set myself up
for failure.

01:14:52.589 --> 01:14:55.158
Easier just to see her
in the parking lot.

01:14:55.191 --> 01:15:01.164
So, I was walking away
and I heard this gasp

01:15:01.197 --> 01:15:04.300
and I turned,
and I saw your mother

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:08.938
standing there at her car,
her crazy, haunted car,

01:15:08.972 --> 01:15:11.074
and she's at the back
of her car and she's
looking in the trunk.

01:15:11.107 --> 01:15:12.976
And I run over there--
I'm not exactly sure why

01:15:13.009 --> 01:15:16.279
because it wasn't
a scared gasp--
more excited.

01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:21.217
So I get there
and in her car,

01:15:21.250 --> 01:15:24.721
in the trunk
of her car was--

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:26.690
Was a brand-new tennis racket
and tennis outfit.

01:15:26.723 --> 01:15:29.559
You ruined it.
No, no.

01:15:29.593 --> 01:15:31.327
It was more dramatic
this way.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:32.862
Was it?
SOPHIE: Yeah, it was.

01:15:32.896 --> 01:15:35.064
I got goose bumps.
Hey, Grandma.

01:15:35.098 --> 01:15:37.000
All right, so we were looking
at this tennis stuff.

01:15:37.033 --> 01:15:39.068
It was really nice.

01:15:39.102 --> 01:15:41.304
Your mom said
she didn't put it there.
She didn't have the money.

01:15:41.337 --> 01:15:43.707
Her crazy mom claimed
that she didn't put it there.

01:15:43.740 --> 01:15:45.308
Star put it there.

01:15:45.341 --> 01:15:46.676
PADDY:
I'm not saying that.

01:15:46.710 --> 01:15:49.212
I am.
Anyway.

01:15:49.245 --> 01:15:52.148
With this tennis stuff,
I was able to see your mom
during the day

01:15:52.181 --> 01:15:54.117
because I gave her
free tennis lessons,

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:55.819
and then I came over here
at night.

01:15:55.852 --> 01:16:00.890
And after that, we were
never really apart.

01:16:00.924 --> 01:16:05.795
Star gives you what you need
to find the love of your life.

01:16:05.829 --> 01:16:08.898
So, wait. Was Samir
the love of your life?

01:16:08.932 --> 01:16:11.367
( LAUGHTER )

01:16:11.400 --> 01:16:13.269
Oh, the old wrinkly guy?

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:16.773
No, no, no, no, no.
( LAUGHS )

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:19.743
Well, but I thought
the thing with the gas can...

01:16:19.776 --> 01:16:21.010
Oh, the gas can.

01:16:21.044 --> 01:16:24.013
Yes, the gas can
got us to Chicago,

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:26.783
and I'd never
been there before.

01:16:26.816 --> 01:16:28.351
( SIGHS )
After I dropped off Samir,

01:16:28.384 --> 01:16:32.355
I realized something--
I love life.

01:16:32.388 --> 01:16:34.891
I love adventure.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:36.726
That became
the love of my life.

01:16:38.227 --> 01:16:40.296
Drake said
I don't like myself.

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:42.265
Well, that's crazy.
What's not to like?

01:16:42.298 --> 01:16:43.366
Who's Drake?

01:16:43.399 --> 01:16:45.134
I mean, maybe he's right.

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:49.238
Well, you love me,
you love your mom,

01:16:49.272 --> 01:16:51.741
and you're part
of each of us.

01:16:51.775 --> 01:16:53.910
( SIGHS ) I never--
I never thought of it that way.

01:16:53.943 --> 01:16:56.713
Well, maybe
you just needed someone

01:16:56.746 --> 01:16:58.414
to show you
how great you are.

01:16:58.447 --> 01:17:00.750
Or something.

01:17:00.784 --> 01:17:02.051
The car.

01:17:02.085 --> 01:17:05.655
The car, yeah.
The car takes you places.

01:17:05.689 --> 01:17:06.723
Now who's Drake?

01:17:06.756 --> 01:17:09.292
Uh, I have to go.

01:17:09.325 --> 01:17:11.260
Okay, baby.
Well, have a good time.

01:17:14.864 --> 01:17:15.865
All right.
Who's Drake?

01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:20.003
You'd like him.

01:17:20.036 --> 01:17:21.170
I don't think so.

01:17:50.299 --> 01:17:51.367
Man!
DRAKE: Oh, what?

01:17:56.205 --> 01:17:57.306
I thought you had poofed.

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:59.876
I mean,
teleported back to LA.

01:17:59.909 --> 01:18:01.745
No, still here.

01:18:01.778 --> 01:18:03.112
Wait, why would I poof?

01:18:03.146 --> 01:18:05.982
Well, because I found
the love of my life.

01:18:06.015 --> 01:18:08.417
Okay, see, uh, Star gave
my grandmother a gas can

01:18:08.451 --> 01:18:10.119
and she found
that she loves adventure,

01:18:10.153 --> 01:18:12.221
and then Star gave my mom
a tennis racket

01:18:12.255 --> 01:18:15.358
and she found
that she loves my dad,

01:18:15.391 --> 01:18:19.729
and then Star gave me you,
and I found that I love myself.

01:18:19.763 --> 01:18:21.731
I-- I love myself, Drake.

01:18:21.765 --> 01:18:24.067
I found that I don't need
to push people away.

01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:27.003
I don't need to care
what other people think.

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:30.106
I don't need to be worried
that they're going to leave me.

01:18:30.139 --> 01:18:32.909
If I love myself,
others will, too.

01:18:32.942 --> 01:18:35.011
Well, it's about time!

01:18:35.044 --> 01:18:36.079
I mean, I'm funny.

01:18:36.112 --> 01:18:38.447
Yes.
And smart.

01:18:38.481 --> 01:18:39.916
Yes.
And fashionable.

01:18:39.949 --> 01:18:41.050
No!

01:18:41.084 --> 01:18:42.919
Okay, well,
I have my own style.

01:18:42.952 --> 01:18:43.920
Sure?

01:18:54.831 --> 01:18:56.833
Whoa, yeah!

01:18:56.866 --> 01:18:58.201
( ALL CHEER )

01:18:59.836 --> 01:19:02.405
That was so funny!

01:19:02.438 --> 01:19:05.274
Bro, that was hilarious.
Right?

01:19:05.308 --> 01:19:07.410
Nice dance moves, Sophie.

01:19:07.443 --> 01:19:09.913
That robot thing-- yeah.

01:19:09.946 --> 01:19:12.115
So totally awesome.

01:19:12.148 --> 01:19:17.821
Hey, listen, I'm really sorry
for the way things went down.

01:19:17.854 --> 01:19:20.523
Yeah, I've been
a bit of a jerk.

01:19:20.556 --> 01:19:22.425
Friends?
Of course!

01:19:22.458 --> 01:19:23.526
Come here.
Yeah.

01:19:23.559 --> 01:19:24.560
BOTH:
Whoop!

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:25.895
Oh, yeah.
( GIGGLES )

01:19:25.929 --> 01:19:27.296
You good?
Yeah.

01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:29.265
Uh, we should hang out
sometime soon.

01:19:29.298 --> 01:19:31.134
Yeah, yeah,
that'd be great.

01:19:31.167 --> 01:19:33.336
Yeah, we should definitely
go out for that ice cream

01:19:33.369 --> 01:19:36.039
and talk things over?

01:19:36.072 --> 01:19:37.573
Absolutely.

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:41.010
OMG! You are so funny.
And I love that dress.

01:19:41.044 --> 01:19:43.479
Thanks. You guys want
to come to the diner?

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:46.415
Yeah. Your grandma
makes the best waffles.

01:19:46.449 --> 01:19:47.884
Waffle party!

01:19:53.589 --> 01:19:57.226
I guess-- I guess
this is it.

01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:59.428
Uh, I guess so.

01:19:59.462 --> 01:20:01.164
You seem really happy.

01:20:01.197 --> 01:20:02.531
Positive.

01:20:02.565 --> 01:20:05.134
The world is full
of possibilities.

01:20:05.168 --> 01:20:06.469
You know, the cop was right.

01:20:06.502 --> 01:20:08.037
It's not easy
to make you smile,

01:20:08.071 --> 01:20:10.039
but if you do,
it's totally worth it.

01:20:11.407 --> 01:20:12.308
Thanks.

01:20:20.183 --> 01:20:23.519
Um, ta-da!

01:20:23.552 --> 01:20:26.055
( LAUGHTER )

01:20:26.089 --> 01:20:27.590
How'd you do that?
I-- I don't know.

01:20:27.623 --> 01:20:30.326
I can't tell you.
I am a magician.

01:20:30.359 --> 01:20:32.528
I keep my secrets.
EMILY: Come on, tell us.

01:20:32.561 --> 01:20:34.463
SOPHIE: I can't.
I'm sorry, guys. I can't.

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:06.462
( KNOCK ON DOOR )

01:21:06.495 --> 01:21:08.364
Hey, sweetie.
Breakfast is ready.

01:21:08.397 --> 01:21:09.498
Okay, I'll be right down.

01:21:12.201 --> 01:21:13.102
You look happy.

01:21:14.938 --> 01:21:16.039
I am.

01:21:16.072 --> 01:21:17.173
And Star did that?

01:21:19.308 --> 01:21:23.479
Yeah, no, I don't--
I don't know.

01:21:23.512 --> 01:21:24.480
Yes.

01:21:24.513 --> 01:21:25.414
Hm.

01:21:28.484 --> 01:21:30.920
You know, I'm thinking
about taking the day off.

01:21:30.954 --> 01:21:34.190
Do you mind
if I borrow Star?

01:21:34.223 --> 01:21:35.224
Yeah, Dad.
Sure.

01:21:36.325 --> 01:21:37.226
Thanks.

01:21:48.371 --> 01:21:49.405
Here, guys.

01:21:49.438 --> 01:21:51.174
Hey, donut party!

01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:52.408
Here you go.

01:21:52.441 --> 01:21:54.477
These look great.
Smells so good.

01:21:54.510 --> 01:21:55.979
Yeah.
I made them this morning.

01:21:56.012 --> 01:21:57.213
They're so good.
Awesome.

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:58.647
Thanks.
Thanks.

01:22:00.483 --> 01:22:02.151
Oh, this looks good.

01:22:03.386 --> 01:22:05.021
Hey, Tommy,
what can I get for you?

01:22:05.054 --> 01:22:08.024
I am going to have a coffee,
extra black,

01:22:08.057 --> 01:22:10.426
and my partner here...

01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:13.729
I'll have the waffles and
a cup of black coffee, ma'am.

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:15.564
Sure, Officer...

01:22:15.598 --> 01:22:17.233
Mahoney.

01:22:17.266 --> 01:22:19.735
Officer Mahoney.
Nice to meet you.

01:22:19.768 --> 01:22:21.704
It's great to meet you,
too, Officer.

01:22:25.241 --> 01:22:26.675
( LAUGHTER )

01:22:26.709 --> 01:22:28.377
We had her fooled, though.
We had her fooled.

01:22:28.411 --> 01:22:31.714
See, I'm a really
good actor.

01:22:31.747 --> 01:22:35.184
Oh, uh, did you get
that reality show?

01:22:35.218 --> 01:22:39.388
No, I didn't,
but I'm doing the cop drama

01:22:39.422 --> 01:22:42.191
and the director
wants my performance
to be very authentic.

01:22:42.225 --> 01:22:43.526
That's great.

01:22:43.559 --> 01:22:45.128
Yeah, so I'm going
to learn the ropes,

01:22:45.161 --> 01:22:47.330
going on some ride-alongs.
Makes sense.

01:22:47.363 --> 01:22:49.999
And I told them that this
is the town to do it in.

01:22:50.033 --> 01:22:52.268
Oh, yeah, a big city
like this full of crime

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:54.203
and fast car chases--
only option, really.

01:22:54.237 --> 01:22:56.239
Exactly.
I knew you'd get it.

01:22:56.272 --> 01:22:58.041
Yeah.
Oh, I'll get your coffee.

01:22:58.074 --> 01:22:59.775
Cool.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.710
Here you go.
Thank you.

01:23:01.744 --> 01:23:05.581
Now, speaking of black,
where's all of yours?

01:23:05.614 --> 01:23:08.617
Oh, um, I don't know.

01:23:08.651 --> 01:23:10.186
I'm trying something new.

01:23:16.625 --> 01:23:20.063
This happens
all the time.

01:23:20.096 --> 01:23:21.397
It's the uniform.

01:23:24.767 --> 01:23:26.169
I'm going
to get a newspaper.

01:23:26.202 --> 01:23:27.303
Yeah, thanks, buddy.

01:23:28.404 --> 01:23:30.139
Oh, almost forgot.

01:23:30.173 --> 01:23:31.574
Happy birthday.

01:23:31.607 --> 01:23:32.575
It's not my birthday.

01:23:32.608 --> 01:23:34.577
Right.
Happy late birthday.

01:23:36.079 --> 01:23:38.214
I never got you
a birthday present,

01:23:38.247 --> 01:23:41.050
but you helped me get home
in time for my auditions

01:23:41.084 --> 01:23:44.587
and you showed me
a part of this world
that I've never seen before.

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:46.389
You showed me how to be
a real artist.

01:23:48.257 --> 01:23:49.792
So, open it.

01:23:53.229 --> 01:23:54.130
Whoa!

01:23:56.132 --> 01:23:59.835
It's to make movies,
to tell some of your stories,

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:02.171
because you've got
some really great ones.

01:24:03.272 --> 01:24:04.607
Wow, thank you so much.

01:24:10.613 --> 01:24:13.482
You know, we were rudely
interrupted last time.

01:24:15.418 --> 01:24:17.653
Totally.

01:24:17.686 --> 01:24:23.592
* I'm in love with you

01:24:27.230 --> 01:24:33.136
* Are you in love
With me, too? *
