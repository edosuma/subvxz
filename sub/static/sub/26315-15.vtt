WEBVTT

00:02.741 --> 00:04.221
Hey, I can't go
to the bistro

00:04.265 --> 00:05.831
with you guys today.

00:07.572 --> 00:09.226
"Oh, why is that, Wendy?"

00:09.270 --> 00:11.228
Well, I'll tell you.

00:11.272 --> 00:14.057
I'm scrubbing in
on a transplant.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.494
This woman's getting a new heart
on Valentine's Day.

00:16.538 --> 00:18.105
How beautiful is that?

00:18.148 --> 00:20.672
What I'm hearing
is "no date."

00:20.716 --> 00:22.326
I was gonna say
the same thing,

00:22.370 --> 00:24.502
but I was lifting
this chair.

00:24.546 --> 00:26.330
I don't have a date either,
and I'm fine with it.

00:26.374 --> 00:27.984
Good for you.

00:28.028 --> 00:30.073
Really? You believed me?

00:30.117 --> 00:32.032
I have my first
date with Andy.

00:32.075 --> 00:34.121
Oh, you're going out
with the cop? That's great.

00:34.164 --> 00:36.514
Kind of hoping he picks
me up in the police car.

00:36.558 --> 00:39.822
Never sat in the
front before.

00:39.865 --> 00:41.258
Marjorie.

00:41.302 --> 00:42.607
Are you gonna be okay tonight?

00:42.651 --> 00:44.044
Why wouldn't I be okay?

00:44.087 --> 00:46.916
Well, it's your first
Valentine's Day

00:46.959 --> 00:48.918
since... you know.

00:48.961 --> 00:51.529
Victor died.

00:51.573 --> 00:53.140
I was trying to
be sensitive.

00:53.183 --> 00:55.185
Oh, my bad--
I thought you forgot his name.

00:57.057 --> 00:59.059
I actually have
big plans.

00:59.102 --> 01:00.408
I have a date
with myself.

01:00.451 --> 01:02.149
Hmm. How many times
you have to ask

01:02.192 --> 01:04.151
before you got a yes?

01:04.194 --> 01:07.023
Actually, I'm going
to order in

01:07.067 --> 01:09.330
and watch Notting Hill
because I've never seen it.

01:09.373 --> 01:11.027
You've never seen
Notting Hill?

01:11.071 --> 01:12.376
It's like the
best movie ever.

01:12.420 --> 01:13.725
"I'm just a girl..."

01:13.769 --> 01:15.205
BOTH:
"Standing in front of a boy..."

01:15.249 --> 01:18.121
TAMMY, BONNIE AND CHRISTY:
"Asking him to love her."

01:18.165 --> 01:21.907
I hope it's better
when Julia Roberts says it.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.258
So, Tammy, do you have
a date with Yuri?

01:24.301 --> 01:26.129
Valentine's is a big night
for Uber drivers,

01:26.173 --> 01:27.826
so he's invited me
to ride shotgun.

01:27.870 --> 01:30.090
I'm gonna work the GPS,
hand out some candies,

01:30.133 --> 01:32.222
and probably clean up some puke.

01:32.266 --> 01:36.096
Aw, I wish I was cleaning up
puke with a fella.

01:36.139 --> 01:38.489
Why don't you and I
do something?

01:38.533 --> 01:39.969
Maybe grab dinner.

01:40.012 --> 01:41.318
Adam's got to work anyway.

01:41.362 --> 01:43.451
A Valentine's dinner
with my mother.

01:43.494 --> 01:45.888
Is this the saddest
moment of my life?

01:45.931 --> 01:48.369
No.
No way.Not even close.

02:09.955 --> 02:13.045
This place
is beautiful.

02:13.089 --> 02:15.135
Thank you for
forcing me to shower.

02:16.179 --> 02:18.181
Now I wish Ihad.

02:20.270 --> 02:21.663
To us.

02:23.534 --> 02:25.493
Happy Valentine's Day.Mm.

02:25.536 --> 02:27.930
Complimentary crab cake
for the lovely couple.

02:27.973 --> 02:29.192
Oh, she's my...

02:29.236 --> 02:30.715
Soul mate.

02:34.458 --> 02:37.244
What we won't do
for free food.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.289
Hey, I'm just happy
he thought I could

02:39.333 --> 02:40.856
land someone half my age.

02:40.899 --> 02:43.293
You realize you just
made yourself 80.

02:43.337 --> 02:46.209
Or did I make you 20?

02:46.253 --> 02:47.732
Yeah, let's
go with that.

02:49.212 --> 02:50.866
These are so much better
than the ones

02:50.909 --> 02:52.172
we serve at the restaurant.

02:52.215 --> 02:54.261
But maybe that's because
I'm not racing a busboy

02:54.304 --> 02:56.567
to dig it out of the trash.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.308
The best crab cake
I ever had

02:58.352 --> 03:00.615
was when I lived
in Madagascar.

03:00.658 --> 03:03.357
When did you live
in Madagascar?

03:03.400 --> 03:04.880
When I was in
the Peace Corps.

03:04.923 --> 03:06.403
You were in the
Peace Corps?
Mm-hmm.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.013
It was a good way
to cross

03:08.057 --> 03:09.450
international borders
without a lot of questions,

03:09.493 --> 03:12.017
and a couple of villages
got water, so...

03:13.236 --> 03:14.890
Wow. I can't believe
there's something

03:14.933 --> 03:16.239
about you I don't know.

03:16.283 --> 03:17.762
Oh, honey,
there's lots of things.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.199
Did you know there's
a shotgun pellet

03:19.242 --> 03:20.504
in my left ass cheek?

03:21.592 --> 03:23.551
You're kidding.It was a ricochet.

03:23.594 --> 03:25.814
I wasn't
the intended target.

03:29.513 --> 03:31.646
This is fun, we should
do this more often.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.258
I'll have a Diet
Coke, two limes.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.347
One squeezed,
one not.

03:37.391 --> 03:40.263
Beer, no fruit.

03:40.307 --> 03:42.483
We have a wide selection
of craft beers

03:42.526 --> 03:44.093
and microbrews.
Oh.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.355
You know what?
I'll just take anything

03:45.399 --> 03:46.878
that comes from
a failing steel town.

03:48.967 --> 03:51.274
You sure it doesn't bother you
that I'm having a drink?

03:51.318 --> 03:52.841
Oh, hell no.

03:52.884 --> 03:54.495
Especially not that crappy beer
you ordered.

03:54.538 --> 03:56.061
Oh.

03:56.105 --> 03:57.802
Okay, two limes.

03:57.846 --> 03:59.500
If you were still drinking,
what would you have ordered?

03:59.543 --> 04:01.241
Well, in a place like this,
I'd have gone

04:01.284 --> 04:03.939
with a vodka martini
straight up with a twist,

04:03.982 --> 04:05.332
six olives on the side.

04:05.375 --> 04:06.768
On the side?

04:06.811 --> 04:08.552
Well, I didn't want to waste
the room in the glass,

04:08.596 --> 04:11.251
and the olives were my dinner.

04:11.294 --> 04:13.296
That-that would fill you up?

04:13.340 --> 04:14.819
Well, when you have
six martinis,

04:14.863 --> 04:16.691
that's 36 olives.

04:16.734 --> 04:19.171
You know, it's-it's,
uh, it's weird.

04:19.215 --> 04:21.391
I-I can't picture you
not having it all together.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.175
Oh, I have pictures.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.310
But that's third date material.

04:27.354 --> 04:28.920
Wow.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.313
We're already talking
about a third date.

04:30.357 --> 04:33.316
Let me ask
you something.

04:33.360 --> 04:35.275
Do you own bowling shoes?

04:36.363 --> 04:40.367
No, but you just gave
me a reason to shop.

04:43.021 --> 04:44.414
Okay, Jenny.
You and Todd

04:44.458 --> 04:46.024
make some memories
tonight.

04:46.068 --> 04:48.549
And stay out of prison.

04:48.592 --> 04:50.725
Moment of truth.

04:50.768 --> 04:52.248
How'd we do?

04:52.292 --> 04:54.946
Five stars and
maximum tip.
Oh!

04:54.990 --> 04:56.774
I feel like one
of those stars is mine.

04:56.818 --> 04:58.733
Oh, is true. Your
banter was sparkling.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.300
Oh!

05:03.390 --> 05:04.652
I'm glad you're here.

05:04.695 --> 05:05.870
Me, too.

05:05.914 --> 05:07.394
You're sure you're
okay not going

05:07.437 --> 05:09.439
to some fancy
dinner tonight?
Hell yeah.

05:09.483 --> 05:11.180
Riding around
with a cool guy

05:11.223 --> 05:12.399
in a car
that isn't stolen?

05:12.442 --> 05:13.704
This is the most

05:13.748 --> 05:15.924
romantic night
of my life.

05:15.967 --> 05:17.447
It gets better.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.101
Check under your seat.

05:21.103 --> 05:23.323
A Burger King wrapper?

05:23.366 --> 05:25.063
Keep looking.

05:25.107 --> 05:27.109
Ow.
That's it.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.851
Yuri.

05:29.894 --> 05:31.853
No one's ever given me
a rose before.

05:31.896 --> 05:33.507
Get used to it.

05:33.550 --> 05:34.986
Mmm.

05:42.342 --> 05:43.908
Okay, Hugh Grant.

05:43.952 --> 05:45.432
Do your thing.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.487
Hey, Tammy.

05:57.531 --> 05:59.837
I am freaking out.What's wrong?

05:59.881 --> 06:02.840
I think Yuri wants
to have sex with me tonight.

06:02.884 --> 06:05.452
I haven't dated in a long time.

06:05.495 --> 06:07.541
Remind me, why is that bad?

06:07.584 --> 06:09.978
Because I've been in prison
for seven years

06:10.021 --> 06:12.894
and so has my... you know.

06:12.937 --> 06:14.678
Well, what are you afraid of?

06:14.722 --> 06:16.114
Everything.

06:16.158 --> 06:17.551
I'm afraid we do it
and then he dumps me,

06:17.594 --> 06:19.074
or we do it and it's terrible,

06:19.117 --> 06:20.858
or it's amazing
and then we fall in love

06:20.902 --> 06:22.033
and then he dies.

06:22.077 --> 06:23.426
It happens.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.428
It happened to you.

06:25.472 --> 06:27.299
Yes, I remember.

06:27.343 --> 06:29.214
It's okay, sweetie.

06:29.258 --> 06:31.434
If you're not ready,
just tell him.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.784
Wow, you say stuff
that's so obvious,

06:33.828 --> 06:35.830
but it always makes me
feel better.

06:35.873 --> 06:37.309
Ooh, I got to go.

06:37.353 --> 06:38.702
Here he comes with the tacos.

06:38.746 --> 06:40.704
Wait, it's just a guy
who really looks like him.

06:40.748 --> 06:42.402
Oh, no, it's him. Bye.

06:56.285 --> 06:58.374
Hey, Wendy. What's going on?

06:58.418 --> 07:00.332
I'm about to go into surgery
and I just want

07:00.376 --> 07:02.422
to call and say hi
so you don't get lonely.

07:02.465 --> 07:04.424
Oh, thank you, I'm good.

07:04.467 --> 07:06.426
Happy operating.Oh, I don't operate.

07:06.469 --> 07:07.949
I just hand stuff
to the person who does.

07:07.992 --> 07:10.560
Well, happy handing.

07:10.604 --> 07:12.954
Now it sounds
like you're minimizing.

07:12.997 --> 07:14.042
Goodbye, Wendy.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.437
You take the next call.

07:18.612 --> 07:20.178
Oh.

07:20.222 --> 07:22.572
Look at that:
the couple that got engaged

07:22.616 --> 07:25.140
just got
a free chocolate soufflÃ©.

07:25.183 --> 07:27.490
Hey, after dinner, get on your
knee and ask me to marry you.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.840
No, you've already
been proposed to.

07:29.884 --> 07:31.407
You propose to me.

07:33.278 --> 07:34.497
Fine, but you better say yes.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.847
We'll see.

07:39.589 --> 07:40.808
You know what?

07:40.851 --> 07:42.636
I would love to pretend
to get engaged.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.464
Because I know it's never
gonna actually happen.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.553
Oh, come on.

07:46.596 --> 07:47.989
I'm fine with it.

07:48.032 --> 07:49.425
I have an amazing
group of friends,

07:49.469 --> 07:50.818
I'm gonna have a
kick-ass career.

07:50.861 --> 07:52.472
And between us,

07:52.515 --> 07:54.648
sex with myself has
never been better.

07:59.043 --> 08:00.915
So you're just
giving up on love?

08:00.958 --> 08:02.656
Well, if I'm being honest,

08:02.699 --> 08:04.614
I don't know if I've
ever been in love.

08:04.658 --> 08:06.529
That makes me sad.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.444
Good.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.315
'Cause it's kind
of your fault.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.884
My fault?
What's that supposed to mean?

08:13.928 --> 08:15.538
Nothing.

08:15.582 --> 08:17.497
I was kidding.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.933
Tell me more about
the Peace Corps.

08:18.976 --> 08:20.935
No, I'm not rewarding you

08:20.978 --> 08:24.416
with fascinating stories
about the Orient.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.288
Please.

08:26.331 --> 08:27.550
You know, I thought
we were past

08:27.594 --> 08:28.943
you blaming me
for everything.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.598
That's why it's something
we can joke about.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.731
Jokey-joke-joke.

08:34.775 --> 08:37.517
Every joke has
a kernel of truth.

08:37.560 --> 08:38.648
Not this one.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.171
It's just funny.

08:41.477 --> 08:42.565
Ha-ha,

08:42.609 --> 08:44.524
hee-hee, hoo-hoo.

08:48.615 --> 08:49.920
ANDY:
Okay.

08:49.964 --> 08:52.140
The hostess swears
we're "totally" next

08:52.183 --> 08:54.142
and she's "totally" sorry,
but between you and me,

08:54.185 --> 08:56.013
I don't "totally"
believe her.

08:57.406 --> 08:58.755
Oh, it's fine.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.627
I'm actually having fun
waiting with you.

09:00.670 --> 09:01.976
Same here.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.849
Jill Kendall.

09:05.893 --> 09:09.113
Vivian Prescott.

09:10.593 --> 09:11.681
How. Are. You?

09:11.725 --> 09:13.683
Ne-ver be-tter.

09:14.728 --> 09:17.295
What. Is.
Happening?

09:17.339 --> 09:19.820
Oh. Andy, this is my friend
Vivian from the club.

09:19.863 --> 09:21.430
Vivian, this is Andy.

09:21.473 --> 09:23.432
Oh, nice to meet you.
Hi.

09:23.475 --> 09:25.260
The only club I belong to
is Costco.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.525
Eh, eh?
All right.

09:29.569 --> 09:31.571
Uh, you know what?
I'm gonna go flash my badge

09:31.614 --> 09:33.616
and get us our table.Okay.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.923
So he's a cop?

09:35.966 --> 09:38.273
Yeah, my house got broken into,

09:38.316 --> 09:40.144
so I hired him
for private security.

09:40.188 --> 09:41.885
Oh.

09:41.929 --> 09:44.540
Okay, that makes
much more sense.

09:44.584 --> 09:46.716
What's so funny?Well, for a second, I thought

09:46.760 --> 09:48.675
you guys were on a date.

09:48.718 --> 09:51.503
Oh, God, no.

09:51.547 --> 09:53.331
So, uh, lunch?

09:53.375 --> 09:55.377
Let's do.

09:59.555 --> 10:00.556
Hey!

10:01.601 --> 10:03.690
"Oh, God, no"?
What?

10:03.733 --> 10:05.953
No, it's just, I-- you know,
I heard what you said

10:05.996 --> 10:07.476
to your friend:
"Oh, God, no."

10:07.519 --> 10:09.565
I am so sorry.

10:09.609 --> 10:11.654
That came out wrong.
I didn't mean it.

10:11.698 --> 10:16.703
It's just, she's very judgy and
gossipy and wouldn't understand.

10:16.746 --> 10:18.095
Wouldn't understand what?

10:18.139 --> 10:19.662
No, no, it's not that
she wouldn't understand,

10:19.706 --> 10:21.403
there's nothing to understand,
it's just that...

10:21.446 --> 10:24.624
She's used to me
being with a certain type.

10:26.147 --> 10:29.106
All right, uh, well, um...
how about this?

10:29.150 --> 10:30.934
You enjoy your Diet Coke,

10:30.978 --> 10:34.938
and if your type comes along,
tell him I said good luck.

10:37.941 --> 10:39.900
Ma'am?

10:39.943 --> 10:42.598
Your table's totally ready.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.961
You know that
chicken isn't me.

10:58.005 --> 10:59.963
Are you sure?

11:00.007 --> 11:03.750
It's small and skinny
and a little bitter.

11:03.793 --> 11:05.708
Will you stop?Me? You're the one

11:05.752 --> 11:08.058
who ruined mother-daughter
Valentine's Day.

11:08.102 --> 11:10.234
Come on.What? I'm kidding.
Jokey-joke-joke,

11:10.278 --> 11:12.280
Ha-hee-ho-hoo.

11:13.498 --> 11:14.586
Fine.

11:14.630 --> 11:16.458
There wasa kernel of truth.

11:16.501 --> 11:18.503
I do think it's your fault
I've never been in love.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.636
I knew it. You're unbelievable.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.943
I take you to a nice restaurant
to cheer you up,

11:22.986 --> 11:25.380
and you still find a way
to make me the bad guy.

11:25.423 --> 11:28.644
One nice dinner doesn't make
up for a sucky childhood.

11:28.688 --> 11:32.300
Look, even if I was
a perfect parent...

11:32.343 --> 11:33.170
Ha!

11:33.214 --> 11:35.607
I said "if."

11:35.651 --> 11:37.435
Even then, it wouldn't
have been enough for you,

11:37.479 --> 11:39.046
because nothing's
ever enough for you.

11:39.089 --> 11:40.961
And if there's a reason
you're gonna be alone forever,

11:41.004 --> 11:42.614
that's it.

11:42.658 --> 11:44.529
Wow.

11:44.573 --> 11:46.096
I have two choices.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.750
I can go smoke,

11:47.794 --> 11:51.232
or I can stab you in the
hand with this steak knife.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.326
I knew you didn't
have it in you.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.548
Yuri, wait,
I need to tell you something.

12:03.592 --> 12:04.985
What?

12:05.028 --> 12:06.900
I can't have sex
with you tonight.

12:06.943 --> 12:08.510
Okay.

12:08.553 --> 12:10.164
And maybe tomorrow night.

12:10.207 --> 12:11.687
Okay.

12:11.731 --> 12:13.689
It might be a while,
is what I'm trying to say.

12:13.733 --> 12:15.386
No problem.

12:15.430 --> 12:16.736
Wait, I'm telling you
you can't have

12:16.779 --> 12:18.476
any of this magic,
and you're fine with it?

12:18.520 --> 12:21.479
Hey, if waiting means
spending more time with you,

12:21.523 --> 12:26.528
talking and laughing and-and
being happy, I'll wait forever.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.443
I'm ready.

12:28.486 --> 12:29.661
I'm not trying to
talk you into it.

12:29.705 --> 12:31.794
Well, you did,
you magnificent man.

12:31.838 --> 12:33.361
I haven't done this
for seven years.

12:33.404 --> 12:35.406
I hope your affairs
are in order.

12:37.582 --> 12:40.020
What's wrong with me?

12:40.063 --> 12:42.762
I mean, I'm crazy about this
guy, and the first chance I got,

12:42.805 --> 12:44.764
I threw him under the bus.

12:44.807 --> 12:47.331
Well, it sounds to me
like you got scared.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.811
Those women from the club

12:48.855 --> 12:51.118
have been gossiping
about me for years.

12:51.161 --> 12:52.641
Especially Vivian.

12:54.077 --> 12:57.211
Now I'm finally at a place
where they've stopped whispering

12:57.254 --> 12:59.474
and started saying
"Let's do lunch."

12:59.517 --> 13:01.563
I mean,

13:01.606 --> 13:04.609
we never go, but they say it.

13:06.350 --> 13:08.309
So I panicked.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.354
I thought if I admitted
I was on a date

13:10.398 --> 13:13.357
with Andy the beer-drinking cop,
the gossip would start

13:13.401 --> 13:15.359
and I'd lose 'em again.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.492
Yeah, you wouldn't want
to lose the people

13:17.535 --> 13:20.060
you don't go
to lunch with.

13:20.103 --> 13:22.540
I'm a terrible, shallow person.

13:22.584 --> 13:25.674
Yes.

13:25.717 --> 13:29.417
But you're less terrible and
shallow than you used to be.

13:31.288 --> 13:33.508
You know, it's weird.

13:33.551 --> 13:35.510
The things you say
are so obvious,

13:35.553 --> 13:38.556
but they do make me
feel better.

13:40.167 --> 13:41.559
I got to go.

13:41.603 --> 13:42.822
Oh, if you must.

13:46.913 --> 13:49.089
I'll get it.Let it go to voice...

13:49.132 --> 13:51.613
Hey, Bonnie. It's Bonnie.

13:53.745 --> 13:56.618
I know, I feel that way
when she calls me, too.

13:59.751 --> 14:02.450
Look, I'm sorry to chew your ear
off, but she's impossible.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.191
I offer to spend
Valentine's Day with her,

14:04.234 --> 14:05.757
and she still picks a fight.

14:05.801 --> 14:08.151
Well, you did tell her
she was gonna die alone,

14:08.195 --> 14:11.198
and as a person you've said
that to, it does hurt.

14:11.241 --> 14:14.157
Bunch of snowflakes
I hang out with.

14:14.201 --> 14:16.725
Is she finished?Oh, uh, hang on.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.730
Listen, Bonnie,

14:21.773 --> 14:23.079
you two have a pattern.

14:23.123 --> 14:24.907
It only takes
one of you to break it,

14:24.951 --> 14:26.822
and I think it's got to be you.

14:26.866 --> 14:28.215
Dumb. Go on.

14:28.258 --> 14:29.607
Hey, you called me.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.087
So I'm not supposed
to defend myself

14:31.131 --> 14:32.480
every time she blames me

14:32.523 --> 14:34.351
for everything
that's wrong in her life?

14:34.395 --> 14:36.919
Well, it's what you always do
and it never works,

14:36.963 --> 14:39.226
so why not
try something different?

14:39.269 --> 14:41.358
Name one thing
I could possibly do.

14:41.402 --> 14:42.925
You could just listen

14:42.969 --> 14:45.536
and try to understand
where she's coming from.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.930
Nah. What else you got?

14:47.974 --> 14:49.932
You let him take my plate?

14:49.976 --> 14:51.412
He didn't even ask.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.850
Goodbye, Adam, I love you.

14:56.330 --> 14:59.420
So this was a disaster.
Let's go home.

14:59.463 --> 15:00.856
Not yet. Sit down.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.469
First, let me say
I'm sorry

15:05.513 --> 15:08.081
for that mean thing I said
about you ending up alone.

15:08.124 --> 15:09.386
It's not personal.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.388
I've said it
to Marjorie, Wendy...

15:11.432 --> 15:13.825
On her birthday. I remember.

15:13.869 --> 15:16.828
Anyway, you and I started
to have a conversation,

15:16.872 --> 15:18.613
and I think we should finish it.

15:18.656 --> 15:22.660
You were saying
it's my fault you're single,

15:22.704 --> 15:25.707
and I want to listen
to more of that, please.

15:25.750 --> 15:28.144
Really?

15:28.188 --> 15:31.365
Yeah, I want to know
why you feel that way.

15:31.408 --> 15:33.628
It goes back to
when I was a kid.

15:33.671 --> 15:36.457
You brought boyfriends
home that I thought

15:36.500 --> 15:38.850
were gonna be in our lives
forever but they never were.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.113
That is not...

15:42.985 --> 15:45.553
Please continue.

15:45.596 --> 15:50.514
Watching that kind of taught
me men don't stick around.

15:50.558 --> 15:52.690
I didn't even know what
a healthy relationship
looked like.

15:52.734 --> 15:55.519
How was I supposed
to find one?

15:56.825 --> 15:59.480
Wow. Okay.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.398
This is weird.

16:04.441 --> 16:06.487
Why aren't you fighting back?

16:06.530 --> 16:09.359
Because everything
you're saying is true.

16:09.403 --> 16:12.014
That's never stopped you before.

16:12.058 --> 16:14.408
Maybe I'm trying
something different.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.628
Okay.

16:17.672 --> 16:20.370
Look, I get why relationships
are hard for you.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.633
I was a terrible role model.

16:23.939 --> 16:27.377
Well, in your defense,

16:27.421 --> 16:29.553
you were a big old
drunk at the time.

16:30.902 --> 16:32.861
That is not an excuse.

16:32.904 --> 16:35.559
But you were a single mom
and I was a handful.

16:35.603 --> 16:38.562
Adorable but a handful.

16:38.606 --> 16:40.869
Considering what I put you
through, you were an angel.

16:40.912 --> 16:42.392
You know, until fifth grade,

16:42.436 --> 16:44.829
when you started hitting
the liquor cabinet.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.483
Mom, there was no cabinet.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.442
There was the floor
next to your bed,

16:48.485 --> 16:51.445
the oven, and
the shower caddy.

16:51.488 --> 16:54.317
That you're functional
in the world is amazing.

16:56.145 --> 16:58.191
Don't be so hard on yourself.

16:58.234 --> 17:01.585
I'm the one who's always
bringing up the past

17:01.629 --> 17:03.065
and throwing it in your face.

17:03.109 --> 17:05.067
Yeah, but I did
all those things.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.590
A long time ago.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.159
I need to get over it already.

17:10.203 --> 17:13.162
Well, how about you stop
beating up on yourself

17:13.206 --> 17:14.555
about not being
in a relationship?

17:14.598 --> 17:16.209
You will be.

17:16.252 --> 17:19.125
You are one of the most
incredible people I know.

17:20.648 --> 17:22.606
I love you.

17:22.650 --> 17:24.347
I love you, too.

17:27.394 --> 17:28.830
Do you want to stay for dessert?

17:28.873 --> 17:30.266
I do.

17:36.620 --> 17:39.449
Bonnie Plunkett,
will you marry me?

17:39.493 --> 17:41.364
Yes!
She said yes!

17:41.408 --> 17:43.497
She said yes!

17:43.540 --> 17:45.542
Hey.

17:45.586 --> 17:49.198
Free chocolate soufflÃ©
over here, two spoons.

18:02.603 --> 18:04.561
Hey.

18:04.605 --> 18:06.737
Hello.

18:06.781 --> 18:09.305
I know you're mad at me.

18:09.349 --> 18:12.047
You should go into police work.

18:12.091 --> 18:16.704
Andy, I screwed up big-time
and I am so, so sorry.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.057
The thing you got to know about
me is I'm not a great person,

18:22.101 --> 18:26.757
but I used to be worse,
which means I'm getting better.

18:29.325 --> 18:31.501
And I haven't liked anybody
as much as I like you

18:31.545 --> 18:33.460
in a very long time.

18:33.503 --> 18:34.983
So if you just give me
another chance,

18:35.026 --> 18:39.379
I promise I will do everything
I can not to mess it up.

18:42.773 --> 18:46.690
Look... believe it or not,

18:46.734 --> 18:49.911
um, I think I'm a great catch,

18:49.954 --> 18:53.349
and, uh...

18:53.393 --> 18:56.570
I just want to be with someone
who feels the same way...

18:58.615 --> 19:01.749
...no matter who's looking.

19:03.664 --> 19:05.492
Good night.

19:24.467 --> 19:26.295
I know you said
you were okay by yourself,

19:26.339 --> 19:28.558
but I say that all the time
and I never mean it.

19:28.602 --> 19:30.256
Come on in.

19:30.299 --> 19:32.258
BOTH:
Hi, Wendy.

19:32.301 --> 19:34.303
Hey, guys.

19:34.347 --> 19:37.524
We're not allowed to talk
until she finishes her movie.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.309
WOMAN:
...four TRSs

19:40.353 --> 19:42.006
and tell them
we need radar feedback

19:42.050 --> 19:43.878
before the KFTs return at 1900.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.923
Then inform the Pentagon we'll
need Blackstar cover from...

19:45.967 --> 19:47.403
Is she okay?

19:47.447 --> 19:50.319
She and Andy broke up.

19:50.363 --> 19:51.277
JILL :
I...

19:51.320 --> 19:53.931
I ruined everything.

19:55.324 --> 19:58.284
What? They were talking, too.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.678
How was the surgery?

20:01.722 --> 20:04.464
I sneezed and got kicked out.

20:04.507 --> 20:06.379
I don't even know
if she made it.

20:06.422 --> 20:08.381
Sorry.

20:08.424 --> 20:11.210
Sorry.

20:12.298 --> 20:13.821
How was your dinner?

20:15.301 --> 20:17.825
Christy and I got engaged.

20:22.525 --> 20:25.398
The heart is beating.

20:25.441 --> 20:26.486
That's great.Yay.

20:26.529 --> 20:28.792
Come on, guys,
it's almost finished.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.317
You're right... we got this.Sorry.

20:31.360 --> 20:32.579
I had sex!

20:32.622 --> 20:34.537
Oh, my God!

20:34.581 --> 20:36.191
Forget it.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.366
Tell us everything.

20:37.410 --> 20:38.498
Details, details.

20:38.541 --> 20:40.935
I'm so happy for you.

20:40.978 --> 20:42.284
How was it?

20:42.328 --> 20:44.852
It was like our souls touched.
I kicked out a window.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.943
You don't have to worry
about me, Victor.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.381
I'll never be alone.

20:52.425 --> 20:55.819
Did you know that "nipple"
in Russian is "neeple"?
