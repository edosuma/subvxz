01:08.177 --> 01:10.012
You didn't wake me.

01:11.430 --> 01:12.598
You were sleeping.

01:12.723 --> 01:15.476
It was because you can't bear
to have breakfast with me.

01:15.768 --> 01:17.144
I've boiled you an egg.

01:17.269 --> 01:20.147
I'd hardly have done that
if I didn't want to see you.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.399
Tea or coffee?

01:22.650 --> 01:25.444
Does any woman ever stay
long enough to find out

01:25.569 --> 01:27.446
what the hell goes on in your head?

01:28.906 --> 01:30.574
What are you doing tonight?

01:31.449 --> 01:33.076
I'm seeing my daughter.

01:33.743 --> 01:35.078
Your daughter?

01:35.286 --> 01:36.788
You've kept very quiet about her.

01:37.038 --> 01:38.206
Have I?

01:39.540 --> 01:41.918
Well, she's been abroad for a year.

01:44.045 --> 01:44.921
Did you say tea?

01:46.422 --> 01:47.757
I'm going.

01:50.969 --> 01:53.012
Have fun with your daughter.

02:24.668 --> 02:26.253
Tickets, please.

02:28.547 --> 02:29.798
Tickets.

02:35.721 --> 02:37.180
Tickets.

03:44.288 --> 03:45.623
Hey, you!

04:13.275 --> 04:15.110
Your feet.

04:34.753 --> 04:36.088
Hey, kid.

04:37.881 --> 04:38.882
Up, up.

04:41.802 --> 04:43.262
It's all right.

04:52.938 --> 04:54.023
There now.

04:55.065 --> 04:56.275
Where do you live?

05:01.488 --> 05:02.281
It's just up here.

05:03.365 --> 05:05.451
I'll be fine now.
Thank you.

05:07.453 --> 05:08.662
Goodbye.

05:18.005 --> 05:19.340
Look after yourself.

05:25.762 --> 05:27.680
I'm worried about him.

05:28.181 --> 05:29.307
He looks terrible.

05:29.432 --> 05:31.726
The boy's saying
he doesn't need a doctor.

05:31.851 --> 05:32.518
He does.

05:32.644 --> 05:34.479
- I don't need a doctor.
- Good, then.

05:34.604 --> 05:35.313
Peter!

05:36.230 --> 05:38.316
We're not going to argue
about this.

05:40.902 --> 05:42.320
Remind me,

05:42.820 --> 05:44.072
how old are you now?

05:44.238 --> 05:45.865
Michael's fifteen.

05:45.990 --> 05:47.659
It's scarlet fever.

05:48.826 --> 05:51.621
He'll be in bed
for several months at least.

05:52.622 --> 05:54.374
Complete isolation.

05:54.999 --> 05:57.377
Emily, keep away,
he's contagious.

05:59.879 --> 06:00.964
Emily!

06:17.854 --> 06:19.564
How are you feeling?

06:20.941 --> 06:22.192
Better.

06:24.027 --> 06:25.445
I meant to tell you,

06:26.280 --> 06:28.240
the day I got ill
a woman helped me.

06:28.699 --> 06:29.992
She helped you?

06:30.575 --> 06:32.577
Yes, she brought me home.

06:33.787 --> 06:34.913
Do you have her address?

07:11.490 --> 07:12.575
Hello?

07:13.576 --> 07:14.577
Yes?

07:40.101 --> 07:41.394
I brought you these flowers

07:41.645 --> 07:43.229
to say thank you.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.398
Put them over there in the sink.

08:07.379 --> 08:08.880
I've been in bed

08:09.005 --> 08:09.714
for three months.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.299
You are better now?

08:11.633 --> 08:13.134
Yes, thank you.

08:14.511 --> 08:16.012
Have you always been weak?

08:16.137 --> 08:18.306
No, I've never been sick before.

08:19.724 --> 08:21.434
It's incredibly boring.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.811
There's nothing to do.

08:24.645 --> 08:26.188
I couldn't even be bothered to read.

08:31.068 --> 08:31.735
Well,

08:32.111 --> 08:33.529
thank you again.

08:35.030 --> 08:36.030
Wait.

08:37.157 --> 08:39.409
I'll walk with you,
I have to go to work.

08:43.455 --> 08:44.915
Wait in the hall while I change.

11:34.664 --> 11:36.499
There are two more buckets
downstairs.

11:36.666 --> 11:38.460
You can fill them
and bring them up.

12:06.404 --> 12:07.822
You look ridiculous.

12:07.948 --> 12:09.741
Look at you, kid.

12:13.077 --> 12:14.954
You can't go home like that.

12:18.749 --> 12:19.625
Take off your clothes.

12:20.834 --> 12:22.628
I'll run you a bath.

12:43.732 --> 12:45.985
Do you always take a bath
in your trousers?

12:59.497 --> 13:00.748
It's all right.

13:00.873 --> 13:01.749
I won't look.

14:08.607 --> 14:10.192
I'll get you a towel.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.504
So that's why you came back.

15:31.605 --> 15:33.273
You're so beautiful.

15:35.442 --> 15:37.193
What are you talking about?

15:47.287 --> 15:49.122
Look at me, kid.

15:53.209 --> 15:54.711
Slowly.

15:55.295 --> 15:56.796
Slowly.

16:34.875 --> 16:36.627
You've inconvenienced your mother.

16:37.294 --> 16:39.004
How many more times?
I said I'm sorry.

16:40.756 --> 16:41.674
You scared her.

16:41.799 --> 16:45.302
I got lost, that's all. That's why
I was late. Can I have some more?

16:45.511 --> 16:47.887
How can anyone get lost
in their own town?

16:48.680 --> 16:50.974
I was going to the castle
and ended up at the sports field.

16:51.099 --> 16:53.059
- They're in opposite directions.
- It's none of your business.

16:53.184 --> 16:54.227
He's lying.

16:54.394 --> 16:55.895
He's not lying.

16:57.063 --> 16:58.606
Michael never lies.

17:02.652 --> 17:04.904
I want to go back to school
tomorrow.

17:05.070 --> 17:08.199
- You need another three weeks.
- Well, I'm going.

17:08.992 --> 17:10.076
Peter!

17:53.535 --> 17:54.661
Like this?

17:55.787 --> 17:56.747
That's right.

18:02.502 --> 18:04.171
Not so fast.

18:19.852 --> 18:21.228
It's all right.

18:22.271 --> 18:23.814
Do it again.

18:47.421 --> 18:48.881
What's your name?

18:49.966 --> 18:50.883
What?

18:51.175 --> 18:52.468
Your name?

18:53.219 --> 18:54.595
Why do you want to know?

18:55.596 --> 18:57.598
I've been here three times.

18:58.766 --> 19:00.101
I want to know your name.

19:00.726 --> 19:02.019
What's wrong with that?

19:03.354 --> 19:04.813
Nothing, kid.

19:05.522 --> 19:07.565
There's nothing wrong with that.

19:08.483 --> 19:09.317
It's Hanna.

19:10.110 --> 19:11.444
You looked so suspicious.

19:14.406 --> 19:15.657
What's yours, kid?

19:15.991 --> 19:17.075
Michael.

19:17.867 --> 19:18.785
Michael?

19:21.246 --> 19:23.498
So I'm with a Michael.

19:25.375 --> 19:26.251
Hanna.

19:27.043 --> 19:30.213
The notion of secrecy is central

19:30.338 --> 19:32.132
to Western literature.

19:33.174 --> 19:33.842
You may say

19:34.009 --> 19:36.303
the whole idea of character

19:36.803 --> 19:38.388
is defined

19:39.055 --> 19:39.973
by people

19:40.599 --> 19:44.686
holding specific information which,
for various reasons,

19:45.604 --> 19:49.149
sometimes perverse,
sometimes noble,

19:49.607 --> 19:52.735
they are determined not to disclose.

20:05.581 --> 20:08.375
You never tell me
what you've been studying.

20:09.376 --> 20:10.961
Studying?

20:12.463 --> 20:13.881
At school.

20:17.885 --> 20:19.929
Do you learn languages?

20:20.304 --> 20:21.472
Yes.

20:23.223 --> 20:24.600
What languages?

20:25.809 --> 20:26.852
Latin.

20:31.023 --> 20:32.608
Say something in Latin.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.153
"Quo, quo scelesti ruitis?"

20:37.278 --> 20:40.531
"Aut cur dexteris aptantur
enses conditi?"

20:40.823 --> 20:42.033
It's Horace.

20:44.285 --> 20:45.578
It's wonderful.

20:46.829 --> 20:48.414
Do you want some Greek?

21:01.844 --> 21:04.055
"Oi men ippeon stroton
oi de pesedon"

21:04.264 --> 21:06.599
"ego de ken otto tis eratai".

21:07.892 --> 21:09.185
It's beautiful.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.604
How can you tell?

21:12.689 --> 21:15.858
How do you know
when you've no idea what it means?

21:19.362 --> 21:21.238
What are you studying in German?

21:21.446 --> 21:22.864
I'm studying a play.

21:25.242 --> 21:28.245
By Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.
Have you heard of him?

21:28.579 --> 21:29.788
It's called Emilia Galotti.

21:31.623 --> 21:32.791
You can read it.

21:33.417 --> 21:35.544
I'd rather listen to you.

21:36.211 --> 21:37.337
All right.

21:47.639 --> 21:49.641
"Act 1. Scene 1".

21:50.142 --> 21:52.686
"The setting:
One of the prince's chambers".

21:53.437 --> 21:54.730
"The prince".

21:56.231 --> 21:57.691
I'm not very good.

21:58.859 --> 21:59.860
Go on.

22:02.279 --> 22:03.739
"Complaints,"

22:04.239 --> 22:05.991
"nothing but complaints".

22:06.908 --> 22:10.286
"For goodness' sake,
is there anything in life but work?"

22:11.162 --> 22:14.040
"Just imagine
that people actually envy us".

22:16.167 --> 22:18.169
You're good at it, aren't you?

22:20.755 --> 22:22.298
Good at what?

22:26.469 --> 22:27.678
Reading.

22:32.308 --> 22:33.434
What's funny?

22:36.395 --> 22:38.064
I didn't think
I was good at anything.

24:06.150 --> 24:07.401
What are you doing?

24:07.985 --> 24:09.278
What is this?

24:09.695 --> 24:11.572
Why did you behave
as if you didn't know me?

24:12.448 --> 24:15.409
You didn't want to know me.
You saw I was in the first carriage.

24:15.659 --> 24:17.036
So why did you sit in the second?

24:17.161 --> 24:18.996
What did you think I was doing?

24:19.121 --> 24:20.664
Why the hell
did you think I was there?

24:20.789 --> 24:21.790
How should I know?

24:22.499 --> 24:25.001
Now, I've been working,
I need a bath

24:25.585 --> 24:27.378
and I'd like to be by myself.

24:28.129 --> 24:29.547
Would you please leave?

24:34.969 --> 24:36.846
I didn't mean to upset you.

24:39.682 --> 24:41.851
You don't have the power
to upset me.

24:43.019 --> 24:45.063
You don't matter enough
to upset me.

26:03.014 --> 26:04.432
I don't know what to say.

26:07.143 --> 26:09.520
I've never been
with a woman before.

26:13.357 --> 26:15.318
We've been together four weeks.

26:17.486 --> 26:19.030
I can't live without you.

26:19.655 --> 26:20.907
I can't.

26:21.574 --> 26:23.492
Even the thought of it kills me.

26:30.124 --> 26:33.252
I sat in the second carriage
because I thought you might kiss me.

26:34.629 --> 26:37.882
Kid, you thought
we could make love in a tram?

26:43.511 --> 26:45.513
Is it true what you said?

26:46.181 --> 26:47.766
That I don't matter to you?

27:01.321 --> 27:02.155
Do you forgive me?

27:09.329 --> 27:10.538
Do you love me?

27:28.889 --> 27:30.182
Do you have a book?

27:31.100 --> 27:32.226
Yes, I have.

27:32.810 --> 27:34.395
I took one with me this morning.

27:36.105 --> 27:37.231
What is it?

27:37.648 --> 27:39.191
The Odyssey, by Homer.

27:39.608 --> 27:40.734
It's my homework.

27:44.071 --> 27:46.490
We're changing the order
we do things.

27:47.157 --> 27:50.411
Read to me first, kid,
then we make love.

27:56.125 --> 27:57.793
"The Odyssey, by Homer".

27:58.335 --> 27:59.628
What's an odyssey?

28:00.004 --> 28:01.839
It's a journey,
he sets out on a journey.

28:02.798 --> 28:03.799
Good.

28:08.387 --> 28:12.016
"Sing to me of the man, Muse,
the man of twists and turns"

28:12.141 --> 28:14.350
"driven time
and again off course"

28:14.475 --> 28:16.769
"once he had plundered
the hallowed heights of Troy".

28:17.020 --> 28:18.062
Come here.

28:25.945 --> 28:28.323
"He pressed her hand
to his lips".

28:29.616 --> 28:31.034
"She was dead,"

28:32.243 --> 28:35.079
"and past all help, or need of it".

28:43.671 --> 28:44.672
"I poked into the place"

28:44.797 --> 28:47.592
"and came to a little open patch
as big as a bedroom"

28:48.927 --> 28:50.595
"all hung around with vines"

28:50.929 --> 28:52.472
"and found a man
lying there asleep."

28:53.181 --> 28:56.225
"And, by jinks, it was my old Jim!"

28:57.352 --> 29:00.395
"When you landed, I reck'ned
I could ketch up wid you"

29:00.520 --> 29:02.064
'doubt havin' to
shout at you"

29:02.522 --> 29:04.316
"but when I see dat house,"

29:04.441 --> 29:06.193
"I begin to go slow..."

29:06.485 --> 29:07.861
"Lady Chatterley"

29:08.028 --> 29:10.864
"felt his naked flesh against her"

29:11.073 --> 29:12.950
"as he came into her".

29:14.451 --> 29:18.121
- "For a moment he was still..."
- This is disgusting.

29:20.290 --> 29:22.000
Where did you get this?

29:22.501 --> 29:24.711
I borrowed it
from someone at school.

29:25.379 --> 29:27.130
You should be ashamed.

29:30.801 --> 29:31.969
Go on.

29:33.553 --> 29:36.473
"Billions of blue
blistering barnacles"

29:36.598 --> 29:39.059
"in a thundering typhoon!
It is water!"

29:39.601 --> 29:41.311
"What did you expect it to be?"

29:41.645 --> 29:43.063
- Whiskey.
- "Whiskey,"

29:43.188 --> 29:45.273
"by thunder, whiskey".

29:45.690 --> 29:46.983
"Whiskey?"

29:47.650 --> 29:50.945
- "Come now, captain..."
- That's enough for today, kid.

29:52.363 --> 29:53.781
I was wondering.

29:54.031 --> 29:55.992
Could you get some time off?

29:56.284 --> 29:58.119
Maybe we could go on a trip.

29:58.953 --> 30:00.371
What sort of trip?

30:00.496 --> 30:03.332
A cycling holiday.
Just two days.

30:08.379 --> 30:11.841
I've got a guide book.
I've worked out the route, look.

30:13.426 --> 30:14.885
What do you think?

30:18.264 --> 30:20.641
I think you like planning,
don't you?

30:37.032 --> 30:38.700
"I'm not frightened".

30:40.493 --> 30:41.703
"I'm not frightened of anything".

30:43.580 --> 30:45.332
"The more I suffer,"

30:46.333 --> 30:48.043
"the more I love".

30:48.585 --> 30:51.046
"Danger will only
increase my love".

30:52.088 --> 30:54.925
"It will sharpen it.
Forgive its bias".

30:56.718 --> 30:58.428
"I'll be the only angel
you'll need".

30:59.554 --> 31:02.974
"You will leave life even more
beautiful than you entered it".

31:03.308 --> 31:06.895
"Heaven will take you back,
and look at you and say:"

31:07.187 --> 31:10.023
"Only one thing
can make us so complete".

31:10.607 --> 31:11.733
"And that thing"

31:11.983 --> 31:12.984
"is love".

31:39.301 --> 31:41.178
- Hello.
- Hello.

31:48.185 --> 31:50.187
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

31:51.272 --> 31:52.982
Do you know what you'd like?

31:56.944 --> 31:58.362
What are you having?

31:59.405 --> 32:02.657
- You order, I'll have what you have.
- OK.

32:05.201 --> 32:05.994
Two frankfurters,

32:06.119 --> 32:07.996
two potato salads,
and two beers, please.

32:19.007 --> 32:20.174
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

32:20.883 --> 32:23.553
- I hope your mother was happy.
- Thank you.

32:24.262 --> 32:26.431
She enjoyed her meal very much.

32:42.030 --> 32:43.114
Come on.

32:59.671 --> 33:02.424
Here, let me show you
where we're going.

33:04.426 --> 33:06.053
It's OK, kid,

33:06.970 --> 33:08.847
I don't want to know.

34:59.414 --> 35:00.582
What are you doing?

35:00.832 --> 35:01.875
I'm writing a poem.

35:02.500 --> 35:03.251
About you.

35:06.378 --> 35:07.671
Can I hear it?

35:07.963 --> 35:09.089
It's not ready.

35:10.174 --> 35:11.634
I'll read it to you one day.

36:28.501 --> 36:30.628
- Morning, Hendrick.
- Morning, Mr. Berg.

36:30.795 --> 36:32.922
- You're in court 306.
- Thank you.

36:33.131 --> 36:35.174
- You all right, Michael?
- I'm fine.

36:35.300 --> 36:38.135
- Hurry, you know what she's like.
- Yeah, I'll see you later.

36:38.260 --> 36:39.845
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

36:41.555 --> 36:42.973
Please stand.

36:47.728 --> 36:48.562
Please sit down.

36:53.775 --> 36:55.444
The defendant, please.

37:07.331 --> 37:08.498
They're coming.

37:13.795 --> 37:14.796
Hello.

37:15.047 --> 37:16.006
Hello.

37:17.883 --> 37:19.676
- Did you see that?
- Good morning, ladies.

37:19.801 --> 37:23.846
Gentleman, welcome your new
fellow students and be courteous.

37:24.555 --> 37:25.681
Sit down.

37:26.057 --> 37:26.974
Hello.

37:28.726 --> 37:30.937
- My name's Sophie.
- I'm Michael.

37:32.104 --> 37:35.233
The Odyssey.
Take out your books.

37:39.153 --> 37:42.615
Everyone believes Homer's subject
is homecoming.

37:42.782 --> 37:43.699
In fact, The Odyssey

37:43.824 --> 37:44.867
is about a journey.

37:45.117 --> 37:47.870
Home is a place you dream of.

37:48.162 --> 37:49.956
Berg, I don't mean to distract you,

37:50.081 --> 37:52.208
but you're studying Homer,
not Sophie.

38:01.175 --> 38:02.176
It's wonderful.

38:02.552 --> 38:05.096
Wonderful.
It's going to be a great summer.

38:19.276 --> 38:21.903
- Why do you leave early?
- He always leaves early.

38:22.028 --> 38:25.365
- Do you have somewhere to go?
- See you tomorrow.

38:34.124 --> 38:35.709
I'm sorry I'm late.

38:38.086 --> 38:39.754
I got held up at school.

38:41.965 --> 38:43.466
I've got a new book.

38:44.718 --> 38:46.386
The Lady with the Little Dog.

38:49.681 --> 38:50.891
By Anton Chekhov.

38:51.641 --> 38:54.226
"The talk was that a new face
had appeared on the promenade".

38:55.019 --> 38:56.437
"A lady with a little dog".

39:09.158 --> 39:11.660
Schmitz, one moment, please.

39:13.120 --> 39:17.082
I read the reports on you.
Every single one excellent.

39:17.458 --> 39:19.543
You'll be working in the office.

39:20.169 --> 39:22.796
You got promoted.
Congratulations.

39:34.683 --> 39:36.101
Let's get out of here!

39:36.810 --> 39:39.646
Come on.
Michael, we're leaving, let's go.

39:40.647 --> 39:41.356
Michael.

39:41.481 --> 39:43.900
It's meant to be a surprise,
for your birthday.

39:48.112 --> 39:49.739
- Come on.
- What's the matter?

39:50.823 --> 39:53.534
- I'm sorry, really.
- We thought you'd like it.

39:53.660 --> 39:55.703
We've got beer!
We're going to dance!

39:56.746 --> 39:57.789
I promised someone.

39:58.998 --> 40:00.833
Michael, please!

40:06.798 --> 40:09.634
"Here and there the reflection
of the stars and the lights"

40:10.301 --> 40:12.053
"on the bank quivered and trembled".

40:12.178 --> 40:14.973
- Oh, kid, kid...
- What?

40:15.306 --> 40:16.182
Stop.

40:16.641 --> 40:17.850
What's wrong now?

40:19.018 --> 40:20.687
Nothing's wrong.

40:23.064 --> 40:24.607
Nothing.

40:27.067 --> 40:28.360
You know,

40:28.902 --> 40:30.362
you never ask.

40:31.071 --> 40:33.657
You never bother to ask how I am!

40:34.324 --> 40:35.867
You never say.

40:37.286 --> 40:38.912
It just happens to be my birthday.

40:40.789 --> 40:42.165
It's my birthday, that's all.

40:43.876 --> 40:45.419
You've never even asked when it is.

40:45.586 --> 40:46.795
If you want a fight, kid...

40:46.920 --> 40:49.089
No, I don't want a fight!
What's wrong with you?

40:49.256 --> 40:50.632
What business is it of yours?

40:52.134 --> 40:54.595
It's always on your terms,
everything.

40:55.596 --> 40:56.972
We do what you want.

40:57.139 --> 40:59.516
Always what you want.
My friends were giving me a party.

40:59.641 --> 41:01.018
Why are you here then?

41:01.184 --> 41:02.311
Go back to your party.

41:02.686 --> 41:04.396
Is that what you want?

41:30.588 --> 41:32.381
It's always me
that has to apologize.

41:32.715 --> 41:36.761
You don't have to apologize.
No one has to apologize.

41:45.478 --> 41:47.188
War and Peace, kid.

43:32.582 --> 43:34.709
Now you must go back
to your friends.

43:51.059 --> 43:51.893
Are you all right?

45:23.149 --> 45:24.191
It's him.

45:28.404 --> 45:29.363
Good.

45:30.656 --> 45:32.742
Get the boy something to eat.

45:41.918 --> 45:45.378
I think we all knew
you'd come back to us eventually.

46:54.697 --> 46:55.823
Mr. Berg?

46:56.365 --> 46:57.491
It is eight o'clock.

46:57.992 --> 46:59.493
Your daughter.

47:02.329 --> 47:03.414
Thank you.

47:07.001 --> 47:08.210
Julia.

47:11.171 --> 47:12.214
I've not kept you waiting?

47:13.090 --> 47:14.049
I was early.

47:14.884 --> 47:16.176
Welcome back!

47:19.178 --> 47:19.971
So,

47:20.805 --> 47:22.223
how will you decide?

47:23.349 --> 47:24.517
I don't know.

47:25.143 --> 47:27.103
I'm happy back in Berlin, I suppose.

47:27.270 --> 47:28.521
You've seen your mother?

47:29.439 --> 47:31.858
I wanted to get away, that's all.

47:32.150 --> 47:34.527
It was Paris, but it could
have been anywhere.

47:35.111 --> 47:37.030
Away from your parents.

47:38.907 --> 47:41.242
I'm aware I was difficult.

47:43.161 --> 47:45.038
I wasn't always open with you.

47:48.666 --> 47:51.127
I'm not open with anyone.

47:57.425 --> 47:58.927
I knew you were distant.

48:01.012 --> 48:02.096
You know,

48:03.180 --> 48:05.807
I always assumed it was my fault.

48:06.808 --> 48:08.143
Julia,

48:09.978 --> 48:11.438
how wrong can you be?

48:23.283 --> 48:25.827
- I'll see you very soon?
- I'll see you soon.

48:29.039 --> 48:30.999
- Good night, dad.
- Good night, Julia.

48:39.383 --> 48:43.053
Those in the special seminar group,
please stay on in this room.

48:43.971 --> 48:46.056
Professor Rohl will be here
in a moment.

49:17.461 --> 49:18.838
Well,

49:19.755 --> 49:20.715
we seem

49:20.840 --> 49:25.553
to be quite a small group.
A small group and a select one.

49:26.637 --> 49:29.557
Really, this is going to be
a unique seminar.

49:30.141 --> 49:33.935
We are going to start
with a reading list, gentlemen.

49:34.394 --> 49:35.979
Karl Jaspers...

49:37.022 --> 49:37.814
And ladies.

49:37.939 --> 49:40.609
The Question of German Guilt.

49:57.709 --> 50:00.295
So, this is where you are.

50:00.754 --> 50:01.838
Yes.

50:04.132 --> 50:05.300
Come in.

50:07.761 --> 50:09.554
You take work seriously.

50:10.430 --> 50:11.348
I don't know.

50:11.932 --> 50:13.850
You're rather a serious boy.

50:14.142 --> 50:15.852
It's how I was brought up.

50:17.604 --> 50:18.813
What about you?

50:19.647 --> 50:20.731
Are you serious?

50:23.734 --> 50:25.027
Sure you want to work tonight?

50:27.530 --> 50:28.405
Yeah.

50:30.491 --> 50:32.117
But I won't work every night.

50:33.327 --> 50:34.995
See you tomorrow.

50:48.884 --> 50:50.553
Do you need a hand?

51:15.493 --> 51:16.578
Why all the police?

51:16.703 --> 51:19.372
They're worried
about demonstrators.

51:19.664 --> 51:21.332
For or against?

51:21.583 --> 51:22.876
Both.

51:28.214 --> 51:29.382
Wow, it's a circus.

51:32.760 --> 51:34.095
All rise.

51:37.140 --> 51:39.475
All photographers
are now asked to leave.

51:40.894 --> 51:43.813
This court is now in session.
Please sit down.

51:47.317 --> 51:51.695
First I'm going to hear motions from
each of the defendants' lawyers.

51:52.112 --> 51:53.488
They argue that there is no reason

51:53.614 --> 51:57.534
to keep their defendants in jail
until the outcome

51:57.659 --> 51:58.535
of their trial.

51:58.744 --> 52:01.371
- I'll take it case by case.
- Want a pen?

52:01.538 --> 52:02.831
I've got a pen.

52:03.123 --> 52:04.791
Hanna Schmitz.

52:06.543 --> 52:07.920
Your name is Hanna Schmitz?

52:08.879 --> 52:09.880
Yes.

52:10.547 --> 52:12.382
Can you speak louder, please?

52:12.841 --> 52:15.677
- My name is Hanna Schmitz.
- Thank you.

52:16.011 --> 52:19.598
You were born on October 21, 1922?

52:20.057 --> 52:21.225
Yes.

52:21.934 --> 52:26.271
At Hermannstadt.
And you're now 43 years old?

52:26.897 --> 52:27.898
Yes.

52:28.190 --> 52:31.401
You joined the SS in 1943?

52:32.486 --> 52:33.320
Yes.

52:33.487 --> 52:35.906
What was your reason for joining?

52:37.657 --> 52:40.660
You were working
at the Siemens factory at the time?

52:40.826 --> 52:41.786
Yes.

52:42.036 --> 52:46.332
You'd been offered a promotion.
Why did you prefer to join the SS?

52:46.791 --> 52:47.959
Objection.

52:48.084 --> 52:49.835
I'll rephrase my question.

52:49.961 --> 52:52.588
I'm trying to ascertain

52:52.713 --> 52:55.216
if she joined the SS freely,

52:55.800 --> 52:57.134
of her own free will.

52:58.803 --> 53:00.763
I heard there were jobs.

53:01.180 --> 53:02.390
Go on.

53:02.890 --> 53:05.893
I was working at Siemens

53:06.185 --> 53:08.563
when I heard the SS was recruiting.

53:08.729 --> 53:11.983
Did you know the kind of work
you'd be expected to do?

53:12.567 --> 53:14.485
They were looking for guards.

53:16.404 --> 53:17.572
I applied for a job.

53:17.989 --> 53:21.576
- And you worked first at Auschwitz?
- Yes.

53:21.993 --> 53:23.952
Until 1944.

53:24.828 --> 53:28.248
Then you were moved
to a smaller camp near Krakow.

53:28.748 --> 53:30.166
- Yes.
- Are you OK?

53:30.584 --> 53:32.836
- You then helped move prisoners...
- Yes.

53:32.961 --> 53:36.590
To the west, in the winter of 1944,
in the so-called "death marches"?

53:57.944 --> 53:59.571
So what did you think?

54:00.030 --> 54:01.239
I don't know.

54:02.824 --> 54:04.743
It wasn't quite
what I was expecting.

54:05.076 --> 54:07.370
Wasn't it?
In what way?

54:07.787 --> 54:09.121
What were you expecting?

54:10.039 --> 54:11.540
I thought it was exciting.

54:12.166 --> 54:13.292
Exciting?

54:13.626 --> 54:16.462
Why? Why did you think
it was exciting?

54:16.712 --> 54:18.005
Because it's justice.

54:47.743 --> 54:49.578
Societies

54:50.120 --> 54:51.997
think they operate

54:52.122 --> 54:54.499
by something called morality,
but they don't.

54:54.874 --> 54:58.044
They operate
by something called law.

54:59.337 --> 55:04.300
You're not guilty of anything
merely by working at Auschwitz.

55:05.093 --> 55:08.263
8,000 people worked at Auschwitz.

55:09.013 --> 55:13.977
Precisely 19 have been convicted
and only six for murder.

55:14.102 --> 55:17.814
To prove murder
you have to prove intent.

55:18.940 --> 55:20.441
That's the law.

55:21.484 --> 55:24.821
The question is never
"Was it wrong?",

55:25.238 --> 55:26.990
but "Was it legal?"

55:27.574 --> 55:30.577
And not by our laws.

55:30.785 --> 55:31.786
No.

55:32.495 --> 55:34.706
By the laws at the time.

55:34.831 --> 55:35.915
But isn't that...

55:36.499 --> 55:37.458
What?

55:38.459 --> 55:39.127
Narrow?

55:39.377 --> 55:42.963
Oh, yes, the law is narrow.

55:44.172 --> 55:45.883
On the other hand,

55:46.341 --> 55:49.803
I suspect people
who kill other people

55:49.970 --> 55:52.180
tend to be aware that it's wrong.

55:54.474 --> 55:55.225
Miss Schmitz,

55:56.977 --> 55:59.146
you're familiar with this book?

56:00.856 --> 56:01.565
Yes.

56:02.524 --> 56:05.903
Parts of it have already
been read out in court.

56:06.153 --> 56:07.946
It's by a survivor,

56:08.572 --> 56:10.532
a prisoner who survived,

56:10.866 --> 56:12.618
Ilana Mather.

56:13.452 --> 56:15.913
She was in the camp
when she was a child, wasn't she?

56:16.163 --> 56:18.457
- She was with her mother.
- Yes.

56:18.790 --> 56:20.626
In the book, she describes

56:20.918 --> 56:23.295
a selection process.

56:24.129 --> 56:26.380
At the end of the month's labor,
every month,

56:26.505 --> 56:29.175
60 inmates were selected.

56:29.592 --> 56:33.012
They were sent from the satellite
camp back to Auschwitz.

56:33.137 --> 56:35.014
That's right, isn't it?

56:36.474 --> 56:38.142
Yes, that's right.

56:38.809 --> 56:40.520
And so far,

56:40.811 --> 56:42.897
each of the defendants has denied

56:43.022 --> 56:45.816
being part of that process.

56:46.192 --> 56:48.110
Now I'm going to ask you.

56:49.320 --> 56:50.488
Were you part of it?

56:53.115 --> 56:54.033
Yes.

56:57.703 --> 57:01.249
So you helped make the selection?

57:02.041 --> 57:02.792
Yes.

57:03.084 --> 57:04.335
You admit that?

57:09.799 --> 57:12.467
Then, tell me,

57:13.134 --> 57:15.470
how did that selection happen?

57:16.221 --> 57:18.974
There were six guards,

57:19.516 --> 57:22.644
so we decided
we'd choose 10 people each.

57:24.521 --> 57:26.606
That's how we did it every month.

57:27.607 --> 57:29.234
We'd all choose 10.

57:29.484 --> 57:32.279
Are you saying
your fellow defendants took part?

57:32.696 --> 57:34.447
We all did.

57:35.240 --> 57:37.284
Even though they've denied it?

57:37.826 --> 57:40.245
Saying "We", "We all" is easier

57:40.370 --> 57:43.164
than "l", "I alone",
isn't it, Miss Schmitz?

57:45.125 --> 57:47.294
Did you not realize

57:48.169 --> 57:50.964
that you were sending these women
to their deaths?

57:51.131 --> 57:52.924
Yes, but there were new arrivals.

57:53.091 --> 57:55.510
New women were arriving
all the time.

57:56.052 --> 57:59.513
The old ones had to make room
for the new ones.

58:00.723 --> 58:02.016
I'm not sure you understand.

58:02.183 --> 58:04.101
We couldn't keep everyone.

58:04.351 --> 58:06.187
- There wasn't room.
- No.

58:07.188 --> 58:09.023
What I'm saying is...

58:10.316 --> 58:11.609
Let me rephrase.

58:12.693 --> 58:15.571
To make room,
you were picking women out:

58:15.696 --> 58:18.407
"You and you have to be
sent back to be killed".

58:20.201 --> 58:21.243
Well,

58:21.744 --> 58:23.621
what would you have done?

58:33.380 --> 58:35.674
Should I never have signed up
at Siemens?

58:48.228 --> 58:50.146
Ms. Mather, they're ready for you.

58:54.275 --> 58:56.277
Go, go, go, go.

59:08.414 --> 59:10.458
- Where's Michael?
- I don't know.

59:12.460 --> 59:16.172
In your book you describe
the process of selection.

59:17.006 --> 59:17.966
Yes.

59:18.675 --> 59:22.554
You were made to work and then,
when you were no longer any use,

59:22.679 --> 59:25.390
they sent you back to Auschwitz
to be killed.

59:26.224 --> 59:28.892
Are there people here today
who made that selection?

59:29.017 --> 59:30.102
Yes.

59:31.144 --> 59:32.896
I need you to identify them.

59:34.648 --> 59:36.692
Can you please point them out?

59:49.204 --> 59:49.872
Her.

59:54.376 --> 59:55.669
And her.

59:58.338 --> 59:59.590
Her.

01:00:02.467 --> 01:00:03.886
And her.

01:00:06.221 --> 01:00:07.472
Her.

01:00:10.309 --> 01:00:11.685
And her.

01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:14.604
Thank you.

01:00:14.896 --> 01:00:16.272
Please continue.

01:00:16.606 --> 01:00:18.900
Each of the guards would choose
a certain number of women.

01:00:20.151 --> 01:00:22.195
Hanna Schmitz chose differently.

01:00:22.904 --> 01:00:24.739
In what way differently?

01:00:29.619 --> 01:00:31.370
She had favorites.

01:00:33.372 --> 01:00:35.124
Girls, mostly young.

01:00:35.458 --> 01:00:37.376
We all remarked on it.

01:00:38.461 --> 01:00:41.047
She gave them food
and places to sleep.

01:00:41.422 --> 01:00:42.798
In the evenings,

01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:47.595
she asked them to join her
and we all thought...

01:00:48.137 --> 01:00:50.223
You can imagine what we thought.

01:00:51.015 --> 01:00:52.475
And then we found out

01:00:53.226 --> 01:00:56.604
she was making these women
read aloud to her.

01:00:59.190 --> 01:01:00.941
They were reading to her.

01:01:02.526 --> 01:01:04.778
At first we thought:

01:01:07.322 --> 01:01:09.658
"This guard is more sensitive,
she's more human".

01:01:10.450 --> 01:01:11.993
"She's kinder".

01:01:12.827 --> 01:01:16.206
Often she chose the weak, the sick.

01:01:17.874 --> 01:01:20.627
She picked them out, she seemed
to be protecting them almost.

01:01:21.461 --> 01:01:23.547
But then she dispatched them.

01:01:26.758 --> 01:01:28.802
Is that kinder?

01:01:37.894 --> 01:01:40.730
I want to move on now to the march.

01:01:41.606 --> 01:01:45.068
As I understand it, you and your
daughter were marched for months.

01:01:45.193 --> 01:01:47.611
In the winter of 1944 our camp

01:01:47.736 --> 01:01:48.779
was closed down.

01:01:49.446 --> 01:01:51.156
We were told we had to move on.

01:01:51.365 --> 01:01:53.659
But the plan kept changing
every day.

01:01:54.535 --> 01:01:57.204
Women were dying
all around us in the snow.

01:01:58.497 --> 01:02:00.374
Half of us died on the march.

01:02:00.916 --> 01:02:02.585
My daughter says in the book:

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:06.255
"Less a death march,
more a death gallop".

01:02:07.882 --> 01:02:09.633
Please,

01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:11.886
tell us about the night
in the church.

01:02:19.894 --> 01:02:24.064
That night we thought we were lucky
to have a roof over our heads.

01:02:24.815 --> 01:02:25.691
Go on.

01:02:27.776 --> 01:02:29.737
We'd arrived in the village.

01:02:30.779 --> 01:02:32.906
As always, the guards took

01:02:33.031 --> 01:02:34.991
the best quarters,
the priest's house.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.493
But they let us sleep in a church.

01:02:38.828 --> 01:02:42.290
There was a bombing raid
in the middle of the night.

01:02:42.916 --> 01:02:44.834
The church was hit.

01:02:46.294 --> 01:02:49.631
At first we could only hear
the fire that was in the steeple.

01:02:51.799 --> 01:02:54.469
Then we could see burning beams

01:02:56.221 --> 01:02:58.556
and they began to crash
to the floor.

01:03:01.518 --> 01:03:03.311
Everyone rushed...

01:03:05.688 --> 01:03:07.690
rushed to the doors.

01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:12.445
But the door had been locked,

01:03:12.987 --> 01:03:14.030
on the outside.

01:03:14.614 --> 01:03:18.367
The church burned down
and nobody came to open the doors.

01:03:19.159 --> 01:03:20.911
Is that right?

01:03:21.662 --> 01:03:22.955
Nobody.

01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:25.249
Even though you were
all burning to death?

01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:31.922
How many people were killed?

01:03:33.215 --> 01:03:35.175
Everyone was killed.

01:03:37.594 --> 01:03:39.137
But you survived.

01:03:47.604 --> 01:03:48.689
Thank you.

01:03:51.024 --> 01:03:54.653
I want to thank you
for coming to this country

01:03:55.112 --> 01:03:57.030
today, to testify.

01:04:01.285 --> 01:04:02.452
I don't know.

01:04:03.828 --> 01:04:05.580
I don't know
what we're doing here anymore.

01:04:06.831 --> 01:04:07.832
Don't you?

01:04:07.999 --> 01:04:12.670
You keep telling us to think
like lawyers, but there is something

01:04:12.795 --> 01:04:13.838
disgusting about this.

01:04:14.213 --> 01:04:15.089
How so?

01:04:15.298 --> 01:04:17.425
This didn't happen to the Germans,
it happened to the Jews.

01:04:19.427 --> 01:04:22.930
- What are we trying to do?
- We are trying to understand!

01:04:23.055 --> 01:04:25.892
Six women locked 300 Jews
in a church and let them burn.

01:04:26.017 --> 01:04:27.476
What is there to understand?

01:04:30.897 --> 01:04:34.483
Tell me, I'm asking!
What is there to understand?

01:04:38.112 --> 01:04:39.697
I started out
believing in this trial,

01:04:39.822 --> 01:04:42.074
I thought it was great.
Now I think...

01:04:42.575 --> 01:04:44.118
It's just a diversion.

01:04:44.452 --> 01:04:45.328
Yes?

01:04:45.953 --> 01:04:47.288
Diversion from what?

01:04:47.622 --> 01:04:50.207
You choose six women,
you put them on trial,

01:04:50.373 --> 01:04:51.833
you say: "They were the evil ones,"

01:04:51.958 --> 01:04:53.418
"they were the guilty ones".

01:04:53.668 --> 01:04:55.879
Because one of the victims
happened to write a book.

01:04:56.296 --> 01:04:58.798
That's why they're on trial
and nobody else.

01:04:59.424 --> 01:05:01.134
Do you know how many camps
there were in Europe?

01:05:02.802 --> 01:05:05.305
People go on about
how much did everyone know.

01:05:05.764 --> 01:05:07.599
Who knew? What did they know?

01:05:07.766 --> 01:05:09.142
Everyone knew.

01:05:09.267 --> 01:05:12.562
Our parents, our teachers.
That isn't the question.

01:05:14.022 --> 01:05:15.982
The question is
"How could you let this happen?"

01:05:16.149 --> 01:05:19.277
And better, "Why didn't you
kill yourself when you found out?"

01:05:22.447 --> 01:05:26.701
Thousands. That's how many camps
there were. Everyone knew.

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.419
Look at that woman.

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:40.214
Which woman?

01:05:40.339 --> 01:05:42.383
The woman you're always staring at.

01:05:43.050 --> 01:05:44.385
I'm sorry, but you are.

01:05:53.644 --> 01:05:55.312
I don't know which one you mean.

01:05:56.897 --> 01:05:58.649
You know what I'd do?

01:06:01.193 --> 01:06:02.945
Put the gun in my hand,

01:06:03.529 --> 01:06:04.780
I'd shoot her myself.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.286
I'd shoot them all.

01:09:05.790 --> 01:09:08.251
Why did you not unlock the doors?

01:09:10.420 --> 01:09:12.714
Why did you not unlock the doors?

01:09:15.926 --> 01:09:18.929
I've asked all of you
and I'm getting no answer.

01:09:20.138 --> 01:09:21.848
Two of the victims
are in this court.

01:09:21.973 --> 01:09:23.475
They deserve an answer.

01:09:27.810 --> 01:09:30.272
This is the SS report.
You all have copies.

01:09:31.814 --> 01:09:35.277
This is the report written,
approved and signed by all of you

01:09:35.402 --> 01:09:37.071
immediately after the event.

01:09:37.279 --> 01:09:38.988
In the written report

01:09:39.323 --> 01:09:43.493
you all claim you didn't even know
about the fire until afterwards.

01:09:44.578 --> 01:09:46.121
But that isn't true, is it?

01:09:47.331 --> 01:09:48.415
Well?

01:09:50.417 --> 01:09:51.585
It's not true.

01:09:56.006 --> 01:09:57.633
I don't know what you're asking.

01:09:58.384 --> 01:10:01.428
The first thing is
why didn't you unlock the doors?

01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:02.847
Obviously.

01:10:03.764 --> 01:10:05.641
For the obvious reason.

01:10:06.851 --> 01:10:07.643
We couldn't.

01:10:07.977 --> 01:10:08.978
Why couldn't you?

01:10:09.769 --> 01:10:11.104
We were guards.

01:10:12.313 --> 01:10:14.899
Our job was to guard the prisoners.

01:10:15.692 --> 01:10:17.902
We couldn't just let them escape.

01:10:18.027 --> 01:10:18.987
I see.

01:10:19.612 --> 01:10:22.615
- If they escaped, you'd be blamed.
- No.

01:10:22.740 --> 01:10:24.450
- Maybe even executed.
- No.

01:10:24.784 --> 01:10:25.910
Well, then?

01:10:26.953 --> 01:10:29.247
If we'd opened the doors,
there would have been chaos.

01:10:29.914 --> 01:10:32.000
How could we have restored order?

01:10:32.542 --> 01:10:36.671
It happened so fast. It was snowing,
the bombs, the flames...

01:10:37.046 --> 01:10:39.549
There were flames all over the
village, then the screaming began,

01:10:39.674 --> 01:10:41.801
and got worse and worse.

01:10:41.926 --> 01:10:46.055
If they'd all come rushing out,
we couldn't just let them escape.

01:10:46.306 --> 01:10:48.141
We were responsible for them!

01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:55.023
So you did know what was happening.

01:10:55.147 --> 01:10:56.732
You made a choice.

01:10:57.816 --> 01:10:59.401
You let them die

01:10:59.902 --> 01:11:02.279
rather than risk
letting them escape.

01:11:05.115 --> 01:11:07.367
The other defendants

01:11:07.493 --> 01:11:10.329
have made an allegation against you.
Have you heard this allegation?

01:11:11.705 --> 01:11:13.665
They say you were in charge.

01:11:15.042 --> 01:11:17.878
It isn't true.
I was just one of the guards.

01:11:18.003 --> 01:11:19.296
- She was in charge.
- She was.

01:11:19.421 --> 01:11:20.422
It was her idea.

01:11:20.547 --> 01:11:21.673
Of course she was.

01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.636
- Did you write the report?
- No, we all discussed what to say.

01:11:25.802 --> 01:11:27.888
We all wrote it together.

01:11:28.013 --> 01:11:29.598
She wrote the report.

01:11:29.723 --> 01:11:30.641
She was in charge.

01:11:30.766 --> 01:11:31.683
- Is that true?
- No.

01:11:31.808 --> 01:11:33.519
- Yes, you did.
- Does it matter?

01:11:33.644 --> 01:11:34.436
She wrote it.

01:11:34.561 --> 01:11:37.231
I need to see a sample
of your handwriting.

01:11:39.358 --> 01:11:41.442
- My handwriting?
- Yes.

01:11:41.567 --> 01:11:43.361
To establish who wrote it.

01:11:43.486 --> 01:11:44.278
Your Honor,

01:11:44.403 --> 01:11:45.530
it's not appropriate...

01:11:45.947 --> 01:11:47.031
Take her a piece of paper.

01:11:47.156 --> 01:11:48.825
Counsel, approach the bench.

01:11:48.950 --> 01:11:52.370
- You're going to compare...?
- Approach the bench.

01:11:57.875 --> 01:11:59.919
I will not accept this in my court.

01:12:00.461 --> 01:12:01.712
I'm sorry.

01:12:10.388 --> 01:12:11.514
I'd rather listen to you.

01:12:31.408 --> 01:12:32.450
There's no need.

01:12:37.289 --> 01:12:38.790
I wrote the report.

01:12:53.305 --> 01:12:54.514
Silence, please.

01:12:56.725 --> 01:12:57.684
Order!

01:13:10.489 --> 01:13:12.948
You've been skipping seminars.

01:13:36.514 --> 01:13:38.432
I have a piece of information

01:13:39.183 --> 01:13:41.268
concerning one of the defendants.

01:13:42.186 --> 01:13:43.479
Something they're not admitting.

01:13:43.687 --> 01:13:45.147
What information?

01:13:54.156 --> 01:13:57.535
You don't need me to tell you
it's perfectly clear

01:13:57.743 --> 01:14:01.037
you have a moral obligation
to disclose it to the court.

01:14:01.287 --> 01:14:04.165
It happens this information
is favorable to the defendant.

01:14:05.166 --> 01:14:06.543
It can help her case.

01:14:07.460 --> 01:14:09.128
It may even affect the outcome.

01:14:09.712 --> 01:14:11.214
Certainly the sentencing.

01:14:11.548 --> 01:14:12.465
So?

01:14:13.508 --> 01:14:15.134
There's a problem.

01:14:16.261 --> 01:14:19.889
The defendant herself is determined
to keep this information secret.

01:14:23.601 --> 01:14:25.770
- One moment, please.
- Sorry.

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:36.156
What are her reasons?

01:14:38.867 --> 01:14:40.660
Because she's ashamed.

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:44.121
Ashamed of what?

01:14:49.793 --> 01:14:51.003
Have you spoken to her?

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.588
Of course not.

01:14:53.630 --> 01:14:55.841
Why "Of course not"?

01:14:57.176 --> 01:14:58.510
I can't.

01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:01.763
I can't do that.

01:15:02.890 --> 01:15:04.683
I can't talk to her.

01:15:05.934 --> 01:15:09.688
What we feel
is utterly unimportant.

01:15:09.855 --> 01:15:12.274
The only question is what we do.

01:15:14.443 --> 01:15:18.906
If people like you don't learn from
what happened to people like me,

01:15:19.031 --> 01:15:22.409
then what the hell
is the point of anything?

01:15:30.625 --> 01:15:31.834
Schmitz.

01:15:33.169 --> 01:15:34.795
You have a visitor.

01:15:48.309 --> 01:15:49.602
Quiet, please!

01:15:51.562 --> 01:15:53.564
Gertrud Bauer.

01:15:55.608 --> 01:15:58.361
Andreas Michael Springer.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.698
Michael Berg.

01:16:06.494 --> 01:16:08.830
Walter Schörlich.

01:17:43.422 --> 01:17:44.632
Time's up.

01:18:04.442 --> 01:18:05.902
Are you coming in?

01:18:16.287 --> 01:18:17.872
You took your time.

01:18:40.769 --> 01:18:41.770
What is it?

01:19:04.084 --> 01:19:05.502
Where are you going?

01:19:07.212 --> 01:19:08.463
I'm sorry.

01:19:09.882 --> 01:19:11.508
I need to sleep by myself.

01:19:57.470 --> 01:19:59.096
I'll just be a minute.

01:20:28.792 --> 01:20:29.543
Nazi!

01:20:29.709 --> 01:20:30.794
Nazi whore!

01:20:42.389 --> 01:20:44.015
Silence in the court!

01:20:44.724 --> 01:20:46.393
Silence in the court!

01:20:46.893 --> 01:20:48.353
All rise.

01:20:55.401 --> 01:20:57.194
The court finds guilty

01:20:57.361 --> 01:21:00.698
the defendants Rita Beckhart,
Carolina Steinhoff,

01:21:00.865 --> 01:21:03.325
Regina Kroit, Angela Zeva

01:21:03.450 --> 01:21:05.119
and Andrea Lumen

01:21:06.120 --> 01:21:09.415
of jointly aiding and abetting
murder in 300 cases.

01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:12.710
The court finds guilty

01:21:13.043 --> 01:21:15.045
the defendant Hanna Schmitz

01:21:15.713 --> 01:21:18.174
of murder in 300 cases.

01:21:22.803 --> 01:21:25.473
The court sentences the accused
as follows:

01:21:25.806 --> 01:21:28.726
Rita Beckhart, Carolina Steinhoff,

01:21:29.059 --> 01:21:30.352
Regina Kroit,

01:21:30.603 --> 01:21:33.397
Angela Zeva and Andrea Lumen

01:21:33.939 --> 01:21:36.191
to each serve
a total sentence in prison

01:21:36.608 --> 01:21:38.485
of four years and three months.

01:21:39.235 --> 01:21:40.612
Hanna Schmitz,

01:21:41.696 --> 01:21:45.033
in view of your own admissions
and your special role,

01:21:45.617 --> 01:21:47.744
you're in a different category.

01:21:48.536 --> 01:21:50.747
The court sentences
the accused Schmitz

01:21:51.748 --> 01:21:53.625
to imprisonment for life.

01:22:26.782 --> 01:22:29.201
- Where are we going?
- I said

01:22:29.326 --> 01:22:30.953
I'll tell you when we get there.

01:22:31.537 --> 01:22:33.413
You told me you like surprises.

01:22:33.539 --> 01:22:36.250
I like surprises.

01:22:53.976 --> 01:22:56.186
She's grown, hasn't she?

01:22:58.021 --> 01:23:01.733
I don't know, it's so long
since I saw her, how can I tell?

01:23:03.735 --> 01:23:05.404
It's my fault.

01:23:06.405 --> 01:23:08.156
We shouldn't have come unannounced.

01:23:08.322 --> 01:23:11.117
Daddy's going to live
in his own house.

01:23:14.662 --> 01:23:17.456
Mother, I'm afraid
I have some bad news.

01:23:17.832 --> 01:23:20.293
Julia knows,
we've already told her.

01:23:21.043 --> 01:23:23.254
Gertrud and I,
we're getting a divorce.

01:23:23.754 --> 01:23:27.341
You don't come for your father's
funeral, but you come for this?

01:23:29.927 --> 01:23:31.804
It's not easy for me
to visit this town.

01:23:31.929 --> 01:23:33.389
Were you really so unhappy?

01:23:33.514 --> 01:23:35.808
That's not what I'm saying,
and it's not what I meant

01:23:35.933 --> 01:23:36.642
Well, then?

01:23:39.937 --> 01:23:42.565
You mustn't worry about Gertrud.

01:23:42.982 --> 01:23:46.777
I'm going to look after her.
Anyway, she's a state prosecutor.

01:23:46.986 --> 01:23:49.572
- She earns far more than I do.
- Michael.

01:23:52.116 --> 01:23:54.242
I'm not worried about Gertrud.

01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:56.703
I'm worried about you.

01:24:41.455 --> 01:24:45.668
"Sing to me of the man, Muse,"

01:24:45.793 --> 01:24:47.753
"the man of twists and turns"

01:24:47.878 --> 01:24:50.506
"driven time
and again off course"

01:24:51.006 --> 01:24:55.052
"once he had plundered
the hallowed heights of Troy".

01:25:19.660 --> 01:25:22.621
215, mail.

01:25:24.248 --> 01:25:26.958
217, mail.

01:25:29.002 --> 01:25:31.087
220, mail.

01:25:43.266 --> 01:25:46.102
121966215.

01:25:46.227 --> 01:25:47.353
Number?

01:25:49.522 --> 01:25:50.899
Open it.

01:26:07.874 --> 01:26:11.627
Testing, testing,
One, two, three, testing.

01:26:31.396 --> 01:26:33.565
The Odyssey, by Homer.

01:26:47.162 --> 01:26:48.080
The Odyssey,

01:26:48.455 --> 01:26:49.790
by Homer.

01:26:50.791 --> 01:26:53.544
"Sing to me of the man, Muse,"

01:26:54.628 --> 01:26:56.838

"once he had plundered
the hallowed heights of Troy".

01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:05.721
"...and back he went
to the house of death".

01:27:05.847 --> 01:27:09.642
"But I held fast in place hoping
that others might still come,"

01:27:09.809 --> 01:27:13.396
"shades of famous heroes,
men who died in the old days"

01:27:13.521 --> 01:27:16.649
"and ghosts of an even older age
I longed to see".

01:27:16.816 --> 01:27:20.653
"Come, sheath your sword,
let's go to bed together."

01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:24.198

"Not for all the world, not until
you consent to swear, goddess,"

01:27:33.708 --> 01:27:38.004
"a blinding oath you'll never plot
some new intrigue to harm me".

01:27:39.422 --> 01:27:42.632
"And she began to swear the oath
that I required".

01:27:42.757 --> 01:27:44.843
"Never, she would never
do me harm".

01:27:45.010 --> 01:27:47.429
"And when she'd finished,
then, at last,"

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:50.974
"I mounted Circe's gorgeous bed".

01:27:52.350 --> 01:27:55.604
"When young Dawn with her
rose red fingers shone once more"

01:27:55.729 --> 01:28:00.567
"they yoked their pair again, and

01:28:00.775 --> 01:28:03.445
"they whipped the team to a run

01:28:03.904 --> 01:28:07.199

"Astonishing. I'd always said it was

his feet and flourishing the stick".

01:28:36.852 --> 01:28:40.356
"...even a cake,
rather like a baba au rhum"

01:28:40.481 --> 01:28:42.650
"known as a Zhivago bun".

01:28:54.912 --> 01:28:56.831
The Lady with the Little Dog,

01:28:57.206 --> 01:28:58.791
by Anton Chekhov.

01:29:00.918 --> 01:29:03.379
"The talk was
that a new face had appeared"

01:29:03.504 --> 01:29:06.632
"on the promenade.
A lady with a little dog".

01:29:07.550 --> 01:29:09.051
"Dmitri Dmitrich Gurov"

01:29:09.176 --> 01:29:11.971
"had spent two weeks in Yalta,
so he was bored with it"

01:29:12.138 --> 01:29:14.514
"and always looking
for fresh faces".

01:29:15.306 --> 01:29:17.350
"Sitting in the pavilion
at Vernet"

01:29:17.475 --> 01:29:20.228
"he saw a young woman
walking on the sea front,"

01:29:20.353 --> 01:29:21.354
"fair haired..."

01:29:34.701 --> 01:29:36.369
I want to take out a book.

01:29:38.329 --> 01:29:39.372
Which book?

01:29:49.382 --> 01:29:51.551
Do you have
The Lady with the Little Dog?

01:29:52.886 --> 01:29:53.678
Your name?

01:29:57.682 --> 01:29:59.057
Hanna Schmitz.

01:30:29.963 --> 01:30:31.298
The Lady with the Little Dog.

01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:36.386
The lady with the little dog.

01:30:36.804 --> 01:30:40.015
The lady with the little dog.

01:30:50.650 --> 01:30:53.861
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

01:30:54.028 --> 01:30:56.823
"The lady with the little dog".

01:30:57.240 --> 01:30:58.241
"The..."

01:31:02.954 --> 01:31:04.122
The.

01:31:05.581 --> 01:31:07.458
The, the, the...

01:31:17.343 --> 01:31:18.219
The.

01:32:24.033 --> 01:32:25.951
- No letter?
- No letter.

01:32:26.535 --> 01:32:27.661
Sign.

01:33:55.747 --> 01:33:57.374
You are Michael Berg?

01:33:57.541 --> 01:33:58.417
Yes.

01:34:00.169 --> 01:34:03.839
Thank you for calling me.
You got my letter?

01:34:04.548 --> 01:34:05.674
I have it here.

01:34:06.091 --> 01:34:10.012
As I say, Hanna Schmitz
is coming up for release very soon.

01:34:10.596 --> 01:34:13.390
Hanna has been in prison
for over 20 years.

01:34:14.266 --> 01:34:15.350
She has no family.

01:34:15.476 --> 01:34:17.352
She has no friends.

01:34:18.270 --> 01:34:20.147
You're her only contact.

01:34:21.190 --> 01:34:23.734
And I’m told you don't visit her.

01:34:24.359 --> 01:34:25.694
No, I don't.

01:34:26.278 --> 01:34:30.324
When she gets out she'll need
a job and somewhere to live.

01:34:30.866 --> 01:34:34.911
You can't imagine how frightening
the modern world will seem to her.

01:34:43.377 --> 01:34:45.004
I have no one else to ask.

01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:48.841
If you don't take
responsibility for her,

01:34:49.425 --> 01:34:51.928
then Hanna has no future at all.

01:34:55.306 --> 01:34:56.974
It's kind of you.

01:34:57.642 --> 01:34:59.685
Thank you for letting me know.

01:35:43.770 --> 01:35:45.438
- You are Michael Berg?
- Yes.

01:35:45.564 --> 01:35:48.441
- Louisa Brenner. Good morning.
- How do you do?

01:35:48.984 --> 01:35:51.027
We were expecting you earlier.

01:35:51.528 --> 01:35:52.821
I should warn you.

01:35:52.946 --> 01:35:56.950
For a long time, Hanna held herself
together. She was very purposeful.

01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:01.163
In the last few years, she's
different, she's let herself go.

01:36:04.708 --> 01:36:07.376
I'm taking you
straight to the canteen.

01:36:08.961 --> 01:36:11.338
They've just finished their lunch.

01:36:23.267 --> 01:36:24.685
Table four.

01:37:10.688 --> 01:37:12.690
You've grown up, kid.

01:37:27.539 --> 01:37:29.374
I've got a friend who's a tailor.

01:37:32.544 --> 01:37:33.920
He'll give you a job.

01:37:35.922 --> 01:37:37.256
And I've found you
somewhere to live.

01:37:38.340 --> 01:37:40.884
It's a nice place,
quite small, but it's nice.

01:37:42.553 --> 01:37:44.388
- You'll like it.
- Thank you.

01:37:46.807 --> 01:37:48.350
There are various social programs,

01:37:49.685 --> 01:37:51.812
cultural staff
I can sign you up for.

01:37:52.729 --> 01:37:54.565
The public library is very close.

01:38:01.113 --> 01:38:02.322
You read a lot?

01:38:05.325 --> 01:38:06.785
I prefer being read to.

01:38:12.583 --> 01:38:14.585
That's over now, isn't it?

01:38:24.844 --> 01:38:26.179
Did you get married?

01:38:26.721 --> 01:38:28.806
I did. Yes, I did.

01:38:30.224 --> 01:38:31.559
We have a daughter.

01:38:32.685 --> 01:38:34.770
I'm not seeing as much of her
as I'd like.

01:38:35.104 --> 01:38:37.315
I'd like to see
a great deal more of her.

01:38:40.026 --> 01:38:41.861
The marriage didn't last.

01:38:57.585 --> 01:38:59.879
Have you spend a lot of time
thinking about the past?

01:39:00.546 --> 01:39:01.923
You mean with you?

01:39:02.131 --> 01:39:02.924
No.

01:39:03.716 --> 01:39:04.634
No.

01:39:06.093 --> 01:39:07.512
I didn't mean with me.

01:39:16.978 --> 01:39:19.940
Before the trial
I never thought about the past.

01:39:21.066 --> 01:39:22.776
I never had to.

01:39:23.110 --> 01:39:24.194
And now?

01:39:26.530 --> 01:39:28.073
What do you feel now?

01:39:29.866 --> 01:39:31.952
It doesn't matter what I feel.

01:39:33.161 --> 01:39:35.247
It doesn't matter what I think.

01:39:37.332 --> 01:39:39.167
The dead are still dead.

01:39:46.758 --> 01:39:48.635
I wasn't sure what you had learned.

01:39:49.427 --> 01:39:51.805
Well, I have learned, kid.

01:39:52.931 --> 01:39:54.974
I've learned to read.

01:40:08.904 --> 01:40:10.489
I'll pick you up next week, OK?

01:40:19.915 --> 01:40:21.375
That sounds a good plan.

01:40:24.378 --> 01:40:27.631
We can do it quietly
or we can make a fuss.

01:40:28.549 --> 01:40:29.758
Quietly.

01:40:32.261 --> 01:40:34.263
OK, quietly.

01:40:37.141 --> 01:40:38.726
Quietly.

01:40:47.567 --> 01:40:49.027
Take care, kid.

01:40:49.235 --> 01:40:51.863
You too.
See you next week.

01:43:04.367 --> 01:43:06.787
I've come to collect Hanna Schmitz.

01:43:12.250 --> 01:43:14.002
Please take a seat.

01:43:39.444 --> 01:43:41.071
She didn't pack.

01:43:41.988 --> 01:43:44.198
She never intended to leave.

01:43:50.287 --> 01:43:52.790
"The talk was that a new face"

01:43:53.707 --> 01:43:55.459
"had appeared on the promenade".

01:43:57.628 --> 01:43:59.964
"A lady with a little dog".

01:44:07.179 --> 01:44:08.681
She left me a message.

01:44:10.516 --> 01:44:12.393
A sort of will.

01:44:14.979 --> 01:44:17.773
I'll read the bit
that concerns you.

01:44:25.322 --> 01:44:27.950
"There is money
in the old tea tin".

01:44:28.409 --> 01:44:30.326
"Give it to Michael Berg".

01:44:31.369 --> 01:44:35.957
"He should send it, alongside
the 7,000 marks in the bank"

01:44:36.374 --> 01:44:39.294
"to the daughter
who survived the fire".

01:44:40.003 --> 01:44:41.463
"It's for her".

01:44:42.130 --> 01:44:45.049
"She should decide
what to do with it".

01:44:48.553 --> 01:44:51.431
"And tell Michael I said hello".

01:45:47.778 --> 01:45:48.862
This way.

01:46:10.049 --> 01:46:11.759
- Ms. Mather?
- Yes.

01:46:12.760 --> 01:46:14.804
- You're Michael Berg?
- Yes.

01:46:14.929 --> 01:46:16.347
I was expecting you.

01:46:18.182 --> 01:46:19.725
- Please.
- Thank you.

01:46:22.019 --> 01:46:26.399
So, you must tell me exactly what
brings you to the United States.

01:46:26.524 --> 01:46:29.569
I was here already,
I was at a conference in Boston.

01:46:29.694 --> 01:46:30.987
- You are a lawyer?
- Yes.

01:46:31.154 --> 01:46:33.906
I was intrigued by your letter
but I can't say

01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.783
I wholly
understood it.

01:46:36.159 --> 01:46:37.869
- You attended the trial?
- Yes.

01:46:37.994 --> 01:46:39.954
Almost 20 years ago.

01:46:40.496 --> 01:46:42.290
I was a law student.

01:46:42.457 --> 01:46:45.750
I remember you, I remember
your mother very clearly.

01:46:46.918 --> 01:46:49.921
My mother died in Israel
a good many years ago.

01:46:52.507 --> 01:46:53.550
I'm sorry.

01:46:53.675 --> 01:46:55.010
Go on, please.

01:46:57.387 --> 01:46:59.181
Perhaps you heard

01:46:59.514 --> 01:47:02.225
Hanna Schmitz recently died.

01:47:02.934 --> 01:47:04.144
She killed herself.

01:47:05.479 --> 01:47:06.938
She was a friend of yours?

01:47:08.565 --> 01:47:09.900
A kind of friend.

01:47:11.485 --> 01:47:13.445
It's as simple as this.

01:47:14.571 --> 01:47:17.949
Hanna was illiterate
for the greater part of her life.

01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:21.119
Is that an explanation
of her behavior?

01:47:22.871 --> 01:47:23.747
No.

01:47:24.122 --> 01:47:25.791
- Or an excuse?
- No.

01:47:26.374 --> 01:47:27.834
No.

01:47:30.378 --> 01:47:33.839
She taught herself to read
when she was in prison.

01:47:34.173 --> 01:47:36.217
I sent her tapes.

01:47:39.386 --> 01:47:41.639
She had always liked

01:47:42.056 --> 01:47:43.349
being read to.

01:47:50.314 --> 01:47:52.817
Why don't you start
by being honest with me?

01:47:52.942 --> 01:47:54.985
At least start that way.

01:47:56.070 --> 01:47:58.739
What was the nature
of your friendship?

01:48:03.702 --> 01:48:06.497
When I was young
I had an affair with Hanna.

01:48:12.378 --> 01:48:15.506
I'm not sure
I can help you, Mr. Berg.

01:48:16.757 --> 01:48:18.842
Even if I could, I'm not willing to.

01:48:19.008 --> 01:48:21.553
I was almost 16
when I took up with her.

01:48:21.678 --> 01:48:23.763
The affair only lasted a summer.

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:24.722
But...

01:48:26.724 --> 01:48:28.268
But, what?

01:48:34.399 --> 01:48:35.567
I see.

01:48:38.361 --> 01:48:41.489
And did Hanna Schmitz
acknowledge the effect

01:48:41.614 --> 01:48:43.116
she'd had on your life?

01:48:44.784 --> 01:48:47.245
She had done much worse
to other people.

01:48:53.293 --> 01:48:54.794
I've never told anyone.

01:48:59.340 --> 01:49:02.427
People ask all the time
what I learned in the camps.

01:49:03.719 --> 01:49:05.262
But the camps weren't therapy.

01:49:07.556 --> 01:49:10.100
What do you think these places were,
universities?

01:49:12.019 --> 01:49:14.188
We didn't go there to learn.

01:49:15.397 --> 01:49:18.525
One becomes very clear
about these things.

01:49:21.904 --> 01:49:23.363
What are you asking for?

01:49:23.489 --> 01:49:26.784
Forgiveness for her? Or do you
just want to feel better yourself?

01:49:27.451 --> 01:49:30.746
My advice: Go to the theater
if you want catharsis.

01:49:30.871 --> 01:49:33.332
Please, go to literature.

01:49:33.749 --> 01:49:35.793
Don't go to the camps.

01:49:38.128 --> 01:49:40.255
Nothing comes out of the camps.

01:49:43.050 --> 01:49:43.717
Nothing.

01:49:58.523 --> 01:50:00.024
What she wanted...

01:50:01.192 --> 01:50:03.611
What she wanted was to leave you

01:50:03.945 --> 01:50:05.196
her money.

01:50:05.988 --> 01:50:07.115
I have it with me.

01:50:07.240 --> 01:50:08.449
To do what?

01:50:08.658 --> 01:50:09.909
I don't know...

01:50:10.660 --> 01:50:12.578
As you think fit.

01:50:23.631 --> 01:50:24.799
Here.

01:50:33.724 --> 01:50:35.183
When I was a little girl,

01:50:35.308 --> 01:50:37.310
I had a tea tin for my treasures.

01:50:38.687 --> 01:50:40.605
Not quite like this, it had

01:50:41.231 --> 01:50:42.941
Cyrillic lettering.

01:50:45.610 --> 01:50:47.112
I took it with me to the camp,

01:50:47.779 --> 01:50:48.864
but it got stolen.

01:50:49.656 --> 01:50:52.284
- What was in it?
- Sentimental things.

01:50:52.742 --> 01:50:55.162
A piece of hair from our dogs,

01:50:55.662 --> 01:50:58.248
tickets to the operas
my father had taken me to.

01:50:58.582 --> 01:51:00.625
It wasn't stolen for its contents.

01:51:01.084 --> 01:51:02.002
It...

01:51:02.502 --> 01:51:04.004
It was the tin itself

01:51:04.588 --> 01:51:06.298
that was valuable.

01:51:07.507 --> 01:51:09.009
What you could do with it.

01:51:17.517 --> 01:51:19.978
There's nothing I can do
with this money.

01:51:20.603 --> 01:51:23.647
If I give it to anything associated
with the extermination of the Jews,

01:51:23.773 --> 01:51:25.566
then to me it seems

01:51:26.901 --> 01:51:29.111
like absolution
and that's something

01:51:29.236 --> 01:51:31.113
I'm neither
willing nor in a position to grant.

01:51:32.156 --> 01:51:36.952
I was thinking maybe an organization
to encourage literacy.

01:51:41.457 --> 01:51:42.374
Good.

01:51:43.167 --> 01:51:43.834
Good.

01:51:44.460 --> 01:51:46.921
Do you know if there is
a Jewish organization?

01:51:47.046 --> 01:51:48.631
I'd be surprised if there isn't.

01:51:49.006 --> 01:51:51.342
There is a Jewish organization
for everything.

01:51:52.384 --> 01:51:55.429
Not that illiteracy
is a very Jewish problem.

01:51:57.348 --> 01:51:58.849
Why don't you find out?

01:51:59.475 --> 01:52:00.601
Send them the money.

01:52:16.908 --> 01:52:18.701
Shall I do it in Hanna's name?

01:52:20.703 --> 01:52:22.247
As you think fit.

01:52:27.669 --> 01:52:29.087
I'll keep the tin.

01:52:34.342 --> 01:52:35.510
Thank you.

01:53:28.103 --> 01:53:29.104
Where are we going?

01:53:29.813 --> 01:53:32.107
I thought you liked surprises.

01:53:32.608 --> 01:53:33.609
I do.

01:53:34.193 --> 01:53:35.736
I do like surprises.

01:54:40.215 --> 01:54:42.134
Hanna Schmitz.

01:54:47.139 --> 01:54:48.265
Who was she?

01:54:50.767 --> 01:54:52.811
That's what I wanted to tell you.

01:54:55.439 --> 01:54:57.524
That's why we're here.

01:55:05.782 --> 01:55:06.908
So tell me.

01:55:19.253 --> 01:55:20.963
I was 15.

01:55:23.966 --> 01:55:26.385
I was coming home from school.

01:55:28.596 --> 01:55:30.473
I was feeling ill.

01:55:31.932 --> 01:55:33.976
And a woman helped me.
