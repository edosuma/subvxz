00:04.872 --> 00:07.241
( theme music playing )

01:40.801 --> 01:43.371
Justin on radio:
...and though I am
alone tonight,

01:43.471 --> 01:46.407
I can sense
your presence.

01:46.507 --> 01:48.942
- You are with me,
and I with you.
- Cop: KEEP IT MOVING.

01:49.042 --> 01:52.980
- I SAID MOVE YOUR FEET.
- Some of you are warm
by the fireplace,

01:53.080 --> 01:56.150
- the children
sleeping upstairs.
- SHUT UP IN THERE!

01:56.250 --> 01:58.486
Many of you are
cold and hungry,

01:58.586 --> 02:02.523
carried down the highway
like autumn leaves
in a stream.

02:02.623 --> 02:05.526
But all of you have
one thing in common

02:05.626 --> 02:10.898
- deep inside.
- ( Justin whispering )
Varlyn Stroud,

02:10.998 --> 02:14.635
- ( static )
- I need you.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.638
( normally )
You are alone,

02:17.738 --> 02:20.274
alone when we are torn
from the womb,

02:20.374 --> 02:22.643
- ( static )
- alone when we die...

02:22.743 --> 02:25.045
( static clears )

02:25.145 --> 02:27.581
alone when we stand
and face judgment.

02:27.681 --> 02:31.185
( whispering )
Release my apostle.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.187
He is a good man.

02:33.287 --> 02:37.124
( normally )
All who come before us
and all who follow after,

02:37.225 --> 02:40.494
a thousand million souls--
all alone.

02:40.594 --> 02:43.331
( whispers )
He is my archangel
made flesh.

02:43.431 --> 02:45.466
( normally )
And yet...

02:45.566 --> 02:48.702
I feel you
here with me.

02:48.802 --> 02:50.604
I am no stranger
to your hopelessness.

02:50.704 --> 02:52.673
( whispers )
Find Henry Scudder.

02:52.773 --> 02:55.743
( normally )
The Bible tells us
we were made

02:55.843 --> 02:58.479
in the glorious image
of our Maker.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.614
We are no less perfect
than He.

03:00.714 --> 03:03.317
And yet we look to Him
for absolution

03:03.417 --> 03:08.256
when instead we need
only look into ourselves.

03:12.726 --> 03:14.362
DEVIN KERRIGAN?

03:14.462 --> 03:17.965
YES, MA'AM--
I MEAN, SISTER.

03:18.065 --> 03:20.000
PLEASE HAVE A SEAT.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.370
IF YOU JUST WANNA GIVE ME
HIS ROOM NUMBER,

03:22.470 --> 03:24.238
I RECKON I CAN FIND
THE WAY UP.

03:24.338 --> 03:27.675
- I DON'T WANNA
BE NO TROUBLE.
- HAVE A SEAT.

03:37.518 --> 03:40.321
( Justin praying
in Latin )

04:01.208 --> 04:04.612
( prayer continuing )

04:35.242 --> 04:37.645
Sister:
ARE YOU MR. HAWKINS?

04:38.979 --> 04:40.948
YEAH.

04:41.048 --> 04:44.051
YOU MAY SEE
FATHER KERRIGAN NOW.

04:50.491 --> 04:52.360
Sister:
IS SOMETHING WRONG?

04:52.460 --> 04:55.329
NO.
I MEAN...

04:55.429 --> 04:57.731
HOW'D YOU KNOW MY NAME?

04:57.831 --> 05:00.634
IT WAS ON THE LIST,
OF COURSE.

05:03.771 --> 05:06.139
SO WHAT'S
THIS LIST I'M ON?

05:06.239 --> 05:08.108
AUTHORIZED VISITORS.

05:08.208 --> 05:10.344
HOW'D YOU PICK
MY NAME OFF OF IT?

05:10.444 --> 05:12.380
IT'S A VERY SHORT
LIST.

05:12.480 --> 05:15.048
THERE'S JUST YOUR NAME
AND ONE OTHER.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.919
HENRY SCUDDER.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.423
AS A MATTER OF FACT, YES.

05:38.406 --> 05:41.375
( creaks )

05:45.078 --> 05:47.581
OH, JEEZ.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.386
Kerrigan:
"CHEEKS ARE HOLLOW,
SKIN IS WITHERED,

05:52.486 --> 05:55.856
CRONE-TIME COMES,
THIS LIFE COMES
TO AN END.

05:55.956 --> 05:59.393
'LIFE-- LIFE, DEATH, LIFE,'
THE WORDS OF A CRONE."

05:59.493 --> 06:01.962
CHEEKS ARE HOLLOW,
SKIN IS WITHERED.

06:02.062 --> 06:05.433
CHEEKS ARE HOLLOW,
SKIN IS WITHERED.

06:05.533 --> 06:09.302
CRONE-TIME COMES,
THIS LIFE COMES TO AN END.

06:09.403 --> 06:11.472
LIFE--

06:11.572 --> 06:14.241
THIS LIFE COMES TO AN END.

06:14.341 --> 06:17.077
"LIFE, DEATH, LIFE."

06:17.177 --> 06:19.547
CHEEKS HOLLOW,
SKIN WITHERED.

06:19.647 --> 06:22.082
CRONE-TIME COMES,
THIS LIFE COME TO AN END.

06:22.182 --> 06:25.018
FATHER KERRIGAN?
THERE IS SOMEONE HERE
TO SEE YOU.

06:25.118 --> 06:29.256
THE WORDS OF A CRONE.
THIS LIFE COMES TO AN END.

06:29.356 --> 06:34.161
"LIFE, DEATH, LIFE,"
THE WORDS OF A CRONE...

06:34.261 --> 06:37.030
( rambling continues )

06:51.211 --> 06:53.313
FATHER KERRIGAN...

06:53.413 --> 06:56.249
WHO IS HE?

06:56.349 --> 07:00.320
- CHEEKS ARE HOLLOW,
THE SKIN IS WITHERED.
- WHAT IS HE?

07:00.420 --> 07:04.057
CRONE-TIME COMES,
THIS LIFE COMES TO AN END.

07:04.157 --> 07:06.193
WHERE'S SCUDDER?

07:06.293 --> 07:08.161
LIFE, DEATH, LIFE.

07:08.261 --> 07:11.064
LIFE! DEATH! LIFE!

07:11.164 --> 07:12.666
THE WORDS OF A CRONE!

07:12.766 --> 07:16.837
YOU KNEW HIM.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHERE HE WENT TO?

07:16.937 --> 07:21.041
...THIS LIFE COMES TO AN END.
THE WORDS OF THE CRONE.

07:22.843 --> 07:24.578
CHRIST.
WHAT'D HE DO TO YOU?

07:24.678 --> 07:27.347
( muttering )
CRONE-TIME COMES,

07:27.447 --> 07:29.316
THIS LIFE COMES TO AN END!

07:29.416 --> 07:31.919
THE WORDS OF THE CRONE.

LIFE.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.982
DEATH.

08:35.082 --> 08:37.818
LIFE.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.254
THE CRONE.

09:28.235 --> 09:32.272
Justin:
"AFTER THE GREAT WAR
BETWEEN HEAVEN AND HELL

09:32.372 --> 09:33.941
GOD MADE THE EARTH,

09:34.041 --> 09:38.345
AND GAVE DOMINION
OVER IT TO THE CRAFTY APE
HE CALLED MAN."

09:38.445 --> 09:40.280
( knocks )

09:48.288 --> 09:50.891
JUSTIN?

09:50.991 --> 09:55.562
YOU DIDN'T COME DOWN
FOR BREAKFAST.

09:55.663 --> 09:59.099
OH...
I MUST HAVE BEEN
LOST IN PRAYER.

09:59.199 --> 10:02.703
- ALL MORNING?
- THERE IS MUCH TO PRAY FOR.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.478
SOMETIMES
I THINK YOU GET LOST
IN YOUR OWN IMPORTANCE.

10:11.578 --> 10:14.114
YOU MEAN MY WORK?

10:14.214 --> 10:16.216
THE LORD'S WORK.

10:16.316 --> 10:18.118
YES, OF COURSE.

10:18.218 --> 10:20.287
THAT'S WHAT I MEAN.

10:23.824 --> 10:27.127
YOU MIGHT ALSO BEWARE
OF FALSE PROPHETS.

10:27.227 --> 10:29.763
DOLAN?

10:34.201 --> 10:36.704
ENVY?

10:38.238 --> 10:40.841
COME NOW, IRIS.

10:40.941 --> 10:45.012
I TRUST YOU MUCH MORE
THAN I TRUST TOMMY DOLAN.

11:11.438 --> 11:13.206
( horn honking )

11:13.306 --> 11:15.909
Man:
GET OFF THE ROAD!

11:36.496 --> 11:40.167
HELL, WE'RE LIKE FAMILY.
YOU DON'T STEAL FROM FAMILY.
EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT.

11:40.267 --> 11:43.036
WELL, ALL I'M SAYING IS
THE COUNT HAS BEEN SKINNY.

11:43.136 --> 11:47.707
YOU TRY SQUEEZING
ANOTHER DIME OUT OF
THESE CHILI-PICKERS.

11:47.808 --> 11:50.043
I SWEAR TO GOD,
SAMSON,

11:50.143 --> 11:53.781
I'M TELLING THE TRUTH,
AS THE LORD IS MY WITNESS.

11:54.982 --> 11:58.085
- FINE.
- AW HELL,

11:58.185 --> 12:00.687
DO YOU THINK I'D STEAL
FROM YOU AFTER ALL WE'VE
BEEN THROUGH?

12:00.788 --> 12:04.157
- HELL.
- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

12:04.257 --> 12:08.628
HEY, HAVE YOU HEARD
THAT HUGGINS & FISK
FOLDED?

12:08.728 --> 12:10.764
HUGGINS & FISK?
THAT'S A BIG OUTFIT.

12:10.864 --> 12:13.166
WENT BACK TO THE BARN
LAST MONTH.

12:13.266 --> 12:15.769
WELL, TIMES IS HARD,
I'LL GIVE YA THAT.

12:15.869 --> 12:19.272
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT
THAMES WAS SAYING.

12:19.372 --> 12:22.776
- UH, CLARENCE THAMES?
- NONE OTHER.

12:22.876 --> 12:25.545
GOT A LETTER FROM HIM
DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY.

12:25.645 --> 12:30.383
HIM AND MARGE AND THE GIRLS ARE
LOOKIN' FOR A PLACE TO LAND.

12:30.483 --> 12:31.919
NO KIDDING.

FLASH ACT.

OH! WELL, I'LL BE
A MONKEY'S UNCLE!

12:45.933 --> 12:47.935
WOULD YOU LOOK AT THIS?

12:48.035 --> 12:50.137
RITA SUE MUST HAVE
WASHED THEM IN MY PANTS.

12:50.237 --> 12:51.638
( laughs )

12:51.738 --> 12:56.276
THERE'S ONE...
FIVE, 10, $16.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.745
WELL, I'LL BE DAMNED.

12:58.846 --> 13:01.815
- SEE YOU, STUMP.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.689
GOLD-BRICKING
LITTLE CHISELER.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.791
YOU LITTLE SHIT--
OW!

13:11.892 --> 13:14.427
GOD DAMN.

LET SAY WE GRAB OURSELVES
A SNORT AFTER THE SHOW,

INNOCENT MARTYRS
WHO PERISHED HORRIBLY

SO THAT THEIR SOULS
MAY ENTER

18:19.632 --> 18:24.404

18:40.119 --> 18:41.354
TELL ME SOMETHING,

18:41.454 --> 18:43.423
WAS ANYONE STILL
IN THE MINISTRY

18:43.523 --> 18:45.292
WHEN YOU AND LESTER
WENT HOME?

18:45.392 --> 18:48.695
- THE CHILDREN.
- YES, I MEAN BESIDES
THE CHILDREN.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.163
MISS KEENER THE NURSE.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.432
ANYONE WHO DIDN'T DIE
IN THE FIRE?

18:52.532 --> 18:55.768
NO.
NO ONE EXCEPT
MISS IRIS.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.538
- MISS IRIS? REALLY?
- OH!

18:58.638 --> 19:00.440
SHE ALWAYS CAME BY
TO TUCK THEM IN.

19:00.540 --> 19:03.476
SHE WAS AS DEVOTED
TO THOSE KIDS AS IF'N
THEY WAS HER OWN.

19:03.576 --> 19:06.779
Iris:
MR. DOLAN.
AND ELEANOR.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.615
OH, MISS IRIS.
WE WAS JUST--

19:08.715 --> 19:11.184
REMARKING HOW LOVELY
THE CHOIR SOUNDED TODAY.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.320
YOU MUST'VE BEEN
PRACTICING ALL NIGHT.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.422
NO, NOT ALL NIGHT.

19:15.522 --> 19:17.890
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US,
THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPHER I KNOW

19:17.990 --> 19:21.194
WHO'S REAL ANXIOUS
TO GET SOME SHOTS
OF THIS LOVELY LADY

19:21.294 --> 19:23.563
AND HER ESTEEMED BROTHER
FOR THE EVENING EDITION.

19:23.663 --> 19:26.799
OH. WELL, YOU BETTER
GET ON THEN.

19:30.537 --> 19:32.505
Tommy:
RIGHT THIS WAY.

20:28.361 --> 20:31.230
( sobbing )

20:38.137 --> 20:40.507
OH, EXCUSE ME.

20:41.408 --> 20:43.810
( keening )

20:45.111 --> 20:48.080
WHY, WHAT'S
THE MATTER, CHILD?

20:48.180 --> 20:52.151
OH THERE, THERE, THERE.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.421
BE CALM.

20:54.521 --> 20:57.056
Photographer:
ANOTHER BIG SMILE
FOR ME.

20:57.156 --> 20:59.626
PERFECT.
THANK YOU.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.048
SAMSON'S GOT US
BY THE SHORT AND CURLIES.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.050
HE GOT ALL UPPITY ON ME.

21:58.150 --> 21:59.552
WELL, WE WERE
CHEATING HIM.

21:59.652 --> 22:01.754
JUST A LITTLE BIT
MORE THAN USUAL.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.856
OW. JESUS H.

22:03.956 --> 22:06.759
MEBBE YOU SHOULD
GO OUT AND LOOK
FOR SOFIE TOO, DADDY.

22:06.859 --> 22:08.761
WELL, THERE AIN'T
BUT A FEW ROADS.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.764
SAMSON OR JONES'S CREW
GOT THEM COVERED.

22:13.065 --> 22:14.100
OW!

22:14.200 --> 22:16.403
GOD BLAST IT,
YOU SON OF--!

22:16.503 --> 22:18.638
FELIX, SHE COULD BE
OUT THERE, SICK OR HURT.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.641
OR SHE COULD BE ON A TRAIN,
HALFWAY TO SUNNY CALIFORNEE

22:21.741 --> 22:24.310
FOR ALL WE KNOW.
JESUS H. PARTICULAR CHRIST!

22:24.411 --> 22:27.414
SHOULD OF KEPT MY EYE ON HER.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I WAS THINKING.

22:27.514 --> 22:30.783
I WONDER WHY SHE JUST
TOOK OFF, JUST LIKE THAT.

22:30.883 --> 22:34.086
YOU TALK TO HER YESTERDAY, LIB?
SHE SAY ANYTHING TO YOU?

22:34.186 --> 22:35.688
NO, MAMA.

22:35.788 --> 22:38.491
IT DON'T TAKE A GENIUS
TO FIGURE OUT.

22:38.591 --> 22:41.528
THERE'S JUST NOTHING HERE
FOR HER ANYMORE.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.499
EXCUSE ME.

22:47.266 --> 22:48.735
POOR THING.

22:48.835 --> 22:51.404
FINALLY FOUND HERSELF
A FRIEND AND THEN ALL
OF A SUDDEN--

22:51.504 --> 22:53.940
OW! GOD DAMN IT!

22:54.040 --> 22:55.675
GOD DAMN-IT!

22:55.775 --> 22:58.711
- WOULD YOU GIVE ME THAT?
- WHAT?

22:58.811 --> 23:00.480
HERE.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.829
HEY, SOFIE!

23:27.339 --> 23:30.743
HEY! WHERE'RE YOU
GOING, GIRL?

23:30.843 --> 23:33.780
SOFIE?

23:36.215 --> 23:38.885
( brakes squeal )

23:39.986 --> 23:42.188
SOFIE. HEY!

23:43.890 --> 23:45.825
WAIT UP.

23:45.925 --> 23:48.795
SOFIE!

23:51.163 --> 23:53.633
SOFIE?

23:59.105 --> 24:01.941
SOFIE.

24:13.319 --> 24:16.088
- ( sobbing )
- HEY. HEY!

24:18.057 --> 24:19.959
HEY.

25:06.105 --> 25:08.808
( crowd laughs )

25:13.079 --> 25:15.114
( applause )

25:15.214 --> 25:19.786
BONELESS BILLY BENSON
DIDN'T START OFF LIFE
AS A SIDESHOW CURIOSITY.

25:19.886 --> 25:21.788
OH NO, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN,

25:21.888 --> 25:26.358
THIS SEEMINGLY NORMAL
YOUNG MAN WAS EMPLOYED
AS A STEEPLEJACK

25:26.458 --> 25:28.595
IN THE WINDY CITY.

25:28.695 --> 25:30.563
THAT'S CHICAGO, LADY.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.431
ONE DAY,
HE FELL EIGHT STORIES

25:32.531 --> 25:35.434
YET FOUND HIMSELF
COMPLETELY UNHARMED.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.470
TURNS OUT BILLY HAS
THE AMAZING ABILITY

25:38.571 --> 25:42.374
TO RELOCATE EVERY BONE
OF HIS BODY AT WILL!

25:42.474 --> 25:45.077
( audience gasping )

25:45.177 --> 25:48.114
I'LL BET HE CAN LICK HIMSELF
JUST LIKE A DOG.

25:48.214 --> 25:51.884
IF YOU WAS THE ALTERNATIVE,
I SURE AS HELL HOPE SO!

25:51.984 --> 25:53.986
( laughter )

25:54.086 --> 25:58.057
- ( French music playing )
- ( men hooting )

26:00.426 --> 26:02.695
( whistling )

26:22.214 --> 26:24.350
( cheering uproariously )

26:35.294 --> 26:37.129
( cheering )

26:40.266 --> 26:42.034
COME ON, BOYS!

26:42.134 --> 26:45.137
ALL RIGHT!
I WANT TO THANK YOU
FOR COMING TONIGHT, GENTS.

26:45.237 --> 26:48.240
BUT I CANNOT BE
HELD RESPONSIBLE
FOR ANY LAUNDRY BILLS.

26:48.340 --> 26:49.909
( laughing )

26:50.009 --> 26:52.378
WELL NOW, AIN'T YOU
THE SPORTS?

26:52.478 --> 26:55.614
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
I GOT SOMETHING HERE
THAT I DON'T OFFER

26:55.715 --> 26:59.752
BUT THE MOST DISCRIMINATING
OF GENTLEMEN.

26:59.852 --> 27:02.655
ANYBODY HERE
IN THIS LITTLE
INTIMATE CROWD OF OURS

27:02.755 --> 27:04.791
- EVER HEARD OF MAE WEST?
- Crowd: YES!

27:04.891 --> 27:08.127
WELL, SHE AIN'T HERE
TONIGHT.

27:08.227 --> 27:09.428
( crowd jeers )

27:09.528 --> 27:12.765
BUT IT SEEMS
A CERTAIN PRIVATE DETECTIVE

27:12.865 --> 27:14.934
IN HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA
MANAGED

27:15.034 --> 27:17.670
TO GET A SHOT OF HER DOING
SOMETHING SO PERVERSE,

27:17.770 --> 27:21.340
SO DEPRAVED WITH ONE
OF HER FAMOUS LOVE SLAVES,

27:21.440 --> 27:24.643
THAT THE PHOTOGRAPH HAS BEEN
BANNED IN ALL 48 STATES!

27:24.744 --> 27:27.413
( laughing )

27:27.513 --> 27:32.852
NOW WHAT YOU DO IS
YOU LINE UP A LITTLE HOLE HERE
WITH ANOTHER HOLE HERE...

27:32.952 --> 27:35.287
AND YOU CAN LOOK
RIGHT THROUGH IT.

27:35.387 --> 27:36.923
YOU TWIST THEM A BIT...

27:37.023 --> 27:39.191
RIGHT, RIGHT,
RIGHT...

27:39.291 --> 27:42.261
( laughs crudely )

27:42.361 --> 27:44.130
NOW, BOYS,

27:44.230 --> 27:47.433
BY GOD I CAN'T TELL
IF THAT'S ERROL FLYNN
OR RUDOLPH VALENTINO.

27:47.533 --> 27:49.435
( guffawing )

27:49.535 --> 27:51.704
ALL RIGHT.

27:51.804 --> 27:55.708
OOH NO, THAT'S BIG RUDY
ALL RIGHT.

27:55.808 --> 27:59.445
- ( laughing )
- TWO BITS, GENTLEMEN!
TWO BITS.

27:59.545 --> 28:01.714
A SMALL PRICE
FOR BIG EXCITEMENT!

28:01.814 --> 28:03.950
COME ON, GENTLEMEN,
TAKE ONE PAIR, BOYS,
ONE PAIR.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.252
- Boy: I WANT TWO!
- THERE YOU ARE.

28:42.321 --> 28:46.025
WHERE'D YOU
RUN OFF TO, GIRL?
YOU HAD US FIT!

28:46.125 --> 28:49.061
SHE WAS LOST.
FOUND HER ON THE ROAD.

28:49.161 --> 28:51.497
I'M SORRY.

28:52.631 --> 28:54.834
NEVER MIND THAT.

28:54.934 --> 28:57.436
WE'RE JUST GLAD
YOU'RE BACK, DARLING.

29:19.691 --> 29:21.460
Sofie:
I CAN'T PAY MY WAY.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.763
- I CAN'T READ THE CARDS.
- HELL, HONEY, NOBODY CAN.

29:24.864 --> 29:26.665
NOT REALLY.

29:26.765 --> 29:29.368
MAMA DID.

29:29.468 --> 29:31.037
WELL, THAT DON'T MATTER.

29:31.137 --> 29:33.906
I KNOW YOU AND YOUR MAMA
HAD A HARD RUN.

29:34.006 --> 29:37.143
WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS
FOR YOU GET YOUR REST.

29:38.477 --> 29:41.613
LET SOMEONE TAKE CARE
OF YOU FOR A CHANGE, HUH?

29:41.713 --> 29:43.950
MANAGEMENT'S ORDER.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.502
I GOT SOMETHING.

30:03.602 --> 30:06.438
- YEAH?
- GIVE HIM THIS.

30:12.411 --> 30:13.645
POEMS?

30:13.745 --> 30:16.815
YEAH, POEMS.
ASK HIM WHAT IT MEANS.

30:16.916 --> 30:20.119
ALL RIGHT.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.754
WAIT.

30:22.855 --> 30:25.324
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.595
I SAW THIS OTHER MAN HERE,

30:29.695 --> 30:32.364
WITH TATTOOS,
LIKE THIS.

30:34.700 --> 30:37.203
YOU SHOW THAT TOO.

30:43.742 --> 30:46.178
TELL ME
WHAT HE SAYS.

31:21.813 --> 31:24.516
( heart beating )

31:25.784 --> 31:27.653
( knocks )

31:30.056 --> 31:32.658
ALL SQUARED AWAY?

31:38.597 --> 31:40.899
WHERE'S LODZ?

31:42.101 --> 31:43.802
HE TOOK A POWDER.

31:43.902 --> 31:46.205
WHY?

31:48.874 --> 31:52.945
AIRING OUT IN HERE,
IT'LL BE JUST FINE.

31:53.045 --> 31:56.448
YOU KNOW
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW I WAS
GONE UNTIL YOU CAME.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.286
JUST TILL I'M ASLEEP,

32:00.386 --> 32:02.621
WOULD IT BE
TOO MUCH TROUBLE

32:02.721 --> 32:04.957
IF YOU STAYED?

32:06.025 --> 32:08.160
I COULD DO THAT.

32:31.650 --> 32:35.254
WHAT THE HELL YOU DOING
GIVING LODZ'S TRAILER
TO SOFIE?

32:35.354 --> 32:37.156
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
WHAT AM I DOING?

32:37.256 --> 32:39.658
WHAT IF LODZ
COMES BACK?

32:39.758 --> 32:41.760
THE TRAILER'S HIS.

32:41.860 --> 32:44.997
YOU TALK TO THE BOSS
LIKE I ASKED?

32:45.097 --> 32:48.100
HE AIN'T SEEN HIM
SINCE THE NIGHT
OF THE FIRE.

32:48.200 --> 32:50.136
GOT NO IDEA
WHERE HE WENT?

32:50.236 --> 32:52.338
WELL, IT AIN'T
HIS CONCERN.

32:52.438 --> 32:54.140
IT SHOULD BE.

32:54.240 --> 32:56.142
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

32:56.242 --> 32:58.344
HE CAN'T HAVE
JUST DISAPPEARED.

32:58.444 --> 33:01.347
LILA, PEOPLE BLOW IN AND OUT
OF THIS PLACE EVERY DAY.

33:01.447 --> 33:05.284
HE'S BLIND. WHAT DID HE DO,
FEEL HIS WAY TO A BUS DEPOT?

33:05.384 --> 33:07.786
JUST TOOK OFF
WITHOUT TELLING NOBODY?

33:07.886 --> 33:10.556
WITHOUT TELLING ME?

33:13.625 --> 33:17.696
LOOK, MANAGEMENT THINKS
HE'S GONE AND SO DO I.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.865
THAT'S THE WAY IT IS.

33:19.965 --> 33:24.002
I SURE AS HELL WISH
I COULD TELL YOU
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

33:25.704 --> 33:28.207
I'M SURE YOU DO.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.526
Iris:
I'LL JUST SET THIS DOWN.

33:47.626 --> 33:49.061
WELL, WHO
HAVE WE HERE?

33:49.161 --> 33:51.497
JUSTIN,
THIS IS OUR NEW MAID,
CELESTE WATKINS.

33:51.597 --> 33:55.501
CELESTE WILL BE KEEPING HOUSE
WHILE YOU AND I ATTEND
TO CHURCH BUSINESS.

33:55.601 --> 34:01.107
- WELCOME, CELESTE.
- THANK YOU, SIR.
IT'S AN HONOR.

34:05.311 --> 34:08.480
YOU'RE THE YOUNG LADY
FROM THE RECEPTION.

34:08.580 --> 34:09.815
YES, SIR.

34:09.915 --> 34:12.518
I DON'T KNOW WHY
I CRIED LIKE THAT.

34:12.618 --> 34:14.653
SILLY.

34:14.753 --> 34:17.656
- YOU WERE SO KIND.
- CELESTE IS AN ORPHAN.

34:17.756 --> 34:20.792
AND SHE CAME ALL THE WAY
FROM OREGON AFTER
YOUR BROADCAST.

34:20.892 --> 34:24.130
REALLY?
HOW FLATTERING.

34:24.230 --> 34:27.099
I'VE NEVER HEARD ANYONE
TALK LIKE YOU.

34:27.199 --> 34:29.101
NOT EVER.

34:29.201 --> 34:32.338
ELEANOR,
WOULD YOU SHOW CELESTE
TO HER ROOM.

34:32.438 --> 34:35.241
- PLEASE GET HER BAG.
- OF COURSE.

34:37.676 --> 34:40.279
THIS WAY, SWEETHEART.

34:53.359 --> 34:55.093
IT'S SUCH
A SHAME.

34:55.194 --> 34:59.331
A LOVELY GIRL LIKE THAT
WITH NO ONE ELSE
IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

35:04.069 --> 35:06.405
DON'T WAIT UP.

35:12.010 --> 35:15.481
- Iris: ELEANOR?
- SHE'S ALL SQUARED AWAY,
MISS IRIS.

35:15.581 --> 35:17.783
THANK YOU.

35:23.389 --> 35:26.525
IT WAS SO NICE TO SEE YOU
AND MR. DOLAN CHATTING.

35:26.625 --> 35:28.727
( laughs giddily )

35:28.827 --> 35:30.996
HE'S QUITE A SCAMP,
THAT ONE.

35:31.096 --> 35:32.431
GOODNESS, ELEANOR,

35:32.531 --> 35:36.502
HOW YOU SHINE UNDER
THE GENTLEMAN'S ATTENTION.

35:36.602 --> 35:37.903
OH!

35:38.003 --> 35:41.473
HE ASKED ME
SO MANY QUESTIONS!

35:41.573 --> 35:43.775
DID HE?

36:24.450 --> 36:27.553
AT LEAST SHE'S ALIVE.

36:29.921 --> 36:32.291
THAT'S SOMETHING,
ALL RIGHT.

36:44.202 --> 36:46.772
- I WAS JUST--
- ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED--

36:48.907 --> 36:52.844
- THAT NIGHT...
- I DON'T REALLY WANNA
TALK ABOUT IT.

36:52.944 --> 36:55.481
I KNOW.
ME NEITHER.

36:55.581 --> 36:59.751
I JUST...
WANTED YOU TO KNOW...

37:01.453 --> 37:04.723
I AIN'T SAID NOTHING
TO NOBODY AND I NEVER WILL.

37:04.823 --> 37:07.859
IT'S BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

37:07.959 --> 37:10.629
AND HER, I GUESS.

37:11.997 --> 37:13.865
I GUESS.

37:16.001 --> 37:19.638
I JUST WANTED YOU
TO KNOW.

37:21.507 --> 37:24.610
I APPRECIATE THAT.

37:24.710 --> 37:27.245
Stumpy:
THERE YOU ARE, GIRL.

37:27.346 --> 37:29.715
HELL, I BEEN LOOKING
ALL OVER FOR YOU.

37:31.149 --> 37:35.354
YOU GOT A HALF-DOZEN GENTS
BACK THERE WAITING ON YOU.

37:43.429 --> 37:45.163
SEE YOU AROUND.

37:45.263 --> 37:47.265
SURE.

37:50.101 --> 37:52.771
BY GOD, LOOK AT
THOSE STARS, JONES.

37:52.871 --> 37:56.107
MAN, THEY SURE ARE
OUT TONIGHT, HUH?

37:56.207 --> 37:58.510
YEAH.

39:06.077 --> 39:08.013
( groaning )

39:08.113 --> 39:11.049
( tapping )

39:50.522 --> 39:52.858
Â£ ( Justin grunting )

41:06.565 --> 41:07.899
ABOUT THAT POEM--

41:07.999 --> 41:12.203
WE NEED TO FIND AN OLD LADY
IN INGRAM, TEXAS.

41:14.573 --> 41:16.107
HOW'S HE FIGURE IT?

41:16.207 --> 41:19.578
THE POEM WAS WRITTEN
BY A FELLOW NAMED INGRAM.

41:19.678 --> 41:22.480
CHARLES, JAMES,
SOMETHING.

41:22.581 --> 41:26.818
IT DON'T MATTER.
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU.

41:26.918 --> 41:29.621
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
I WAS SUPPOSED
TO TALK TO YOU.

41:29.721 --> 41:33.124
ALL'S I KNOW IS
WHEN I GAVE HIM THAT PICTURE,

41:33.224 --> 41:35.761
HE GOT ALL STEWED UP.

41:35.861 --> 41:39.731
- THAT DON'T MAKE NO SENSE.
- IT DON'T HAVE TO.

41:39.831 --> 41:44.235
ONLY THING MATTERS IS
HE WANTS TO SEE YOU NOW.

41:53.211 --> 41:55.881
( door opens, closes )

41:59.384 --> 42:02.020
Management:
YOU'VE SEEN THE USHER.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.489
Ben:
USHER?

42:04.590 --> 42:07.092
Management:
THE TATTOOED MAN.

42:07.192 --> 42:09.227
YEAH, I SEEN HIM.

42:09.327 --> 42:11.930
EVERYWHERE.

42:12.030 --> 42:14.633
ON THE DAMN ROAD.
IN MY DREAMS.

42:14.733 --> 42:15.801
WHO THE HELL IS HE?

42:15.901 --> 42:19.204
Management:
SAMHAIN. NECROTUS.

42:19.304 --> 42:21.573
KHAYBET,
LORD OF SHADOWS.

42:21.673 --> 42:25.543
A THOUSAND NAMES
IN A THOUSAND BOOKS,

42:25.644 --> 42:27.579
BUT THEY ALL MEAN
THE SAME:

42:27.679 --> 42:30.448
THE USHER
OF DESTRUCTION.

42:30.548 --> 42:33.819
HE IS FLESH.

42:35.320 --> 42:40.125
IT MEANS THE END-TIMES
ARE NOT NEAR, HAWKINS.

42:40.225 --> 42:42.127
THEY ARE UPON US.

42:42.227 --> 42:45.463
YOU WILL NEVER BE
PREPARED IN TIME.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.199
WE ARE LOST.

42:50.135 --> 42:52.871
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

42:52.971 --> 42:54.505
NO.

42:54.606 --> 42:56.608
WHY THE HELL NOT?

42:56.708 --> 43:00.111
YOU'RE STRONG.
YOU KNOW WHAT
TO DO.

43:00.211 --> 43:03.281
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

43:03.381 --> 43:07.085
- Ben: BUT...
- I'M DYING.

43:13.324 --> 43:15.293
LET ME HEAL YOU.

43:15.393 --> 43:17.562
NO.

43:17.663 --> 43:19.965
YOU SAID
THERE AIN'T MUCH TIME.

43:20.065 --> 43:21.900
SO LET ME GIVE YOU
WHAT I GOT.

43:22.000 --> 43:24.903
IT WOULD BE
AN ABOMINATION.

43:25.003 --> 43:27.438
YOU KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE.
YOU SHOWED ME.

43:27.538 --> 43:29.540
( scoffs )
GET AWAY.

43:29.641 --> 43:32.243
YOU GOTTA DO IT.

43:35.313 --> 43:37.248
HERE.

43:41.753 --> 43:43.421
NO! GET BACK!

43:43.521 --> 43:47.492
- WHY WON'T YOU LET ME DO IT?
- MY TIME HAS PASSED.

43:47.592 --> 43:51.496
IT'S YOUR BATTLE NOW,
BEN HAWKINS.

43:51.596 --> 43:54.299
YOU MUST WALK
YOUR OWN PATH,

43:54.399 --> 43:56.668
BUT WITH HASTE, BOY.

43:56.768 --> 43:59.270
FOR TIME GROWS SHORT
AND YOU CANNOT FALTER.

43:59.370 --> 44:01.339
GO! NOW!

44:01.439 --> 44:04.075
GO!

44:05.043 --> 44:06.812
GO!

44:06.912 --> 44:10.415
( gasps, shallow panting )

44:28.199 --> 44:30.135
WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

44:30.235 --> 44:32.437
( scoffs )

44:32.537 --> 44:35.273
YOU SEEN SKEETER LEWIS?

44:35.373 --> 44:37.008
SKEETER WHO?

44:37.108 --> 44:38.744
SKEETER LEWIS.

44:38.844 --> 44:40.879
I THINK
I BEEN STOOD UP.

44:40.979 --> 44:43.281
( chuckles )
I GUESS SO.

44:43.381 --> 44:45.483
WHAT?

44:45.583 --> 44:47.853
WELL, THE MAN'S DEAD.

44:47.953 --> 44:50.155
THAT AIN'T FUNNY.

44:50.255 --> 44:52.390
I AIN'T FUNNING.

44:55.126 --> 44:57.796
I SAW HIM, BIG AS LIFE,
JUST THIS MORNING.

44:57.896 --> 45:01.933
I SEEN HIM PUT IN THE GROUND
FIVE YEARS AGO COME JULY.

45:05.370 --> 45:09.474
MAYBE IT WAS SOMEONE
LOOKED LIKE SKEETER.

45:09.574 --> 45:11.476
YEAH.

45:15.446 --> 45:19.885
BUT, UH, SHAME TO LET
ALL THAT PERFUME
GO TO WASTE.

45:19.985 --> 45:22.821
YOU KNOW
I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE
STANDING RESERVATIONS

45:22.921 --> 45:26.992
AT ALL THE FINEST
ESTABLISHMENTS IN TOWN.

45:50.481 --> 45:52.951
( barking )

47:02.820 --> 47:07.125
UH, SOFIE?

47:07.225 --> 47:10.195
IT'S OKAY,
WE GOT THIS FINE.

47:20.738 --> 47:23.141
GIVE ME THAT ONE.

47:26.978 --> 47:28.813
- HEY.
- WHAT?

47:28.914 --> 47:30.748
YOU TELL THAT 'DONA
SHE CAN WORK WITH US?

47:30.848 --> 47:33.151
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

47:33.251 --> 47:35.853
( groans )

47:35.954 --> 47:38.924
( sighs )

47:41.259 --> 47:42.860
AIN'T YOU GONNA
DO SOMETHING?

47:42.961 --> 47:44.229
- NO.
- NO?

47:44.329 --> 47:46.431
LOOK, I KNOW SHE LOST
HER MA AND ALL,

47:46.531 --> 47:49.567
BUT DAMN IT, JONESY,
I AIN'T WORKING
WITH NO SKIRT.

47:49.667 --> 47:51.669
THE HELL WITH HER.

47:51.769 --> 47:54.372
- Man: HERE YOU GO.
- LET'S GO.

47:58.609 --> 48:00.946
( grunts )

48:16.361 --> 48:18.129
LET'S GO!
LET'S START 'EM UP!

48:18.229 --> 48:20.165
THAT OUGHT TO HOLD HER.

48:20.265 --> 48:22.600
IF IT DON'T,
FLASH YOUR LIGHTS.

48:36.914 --> 48:38.483
WHERE TO?

48:38.583 --> 48:40.485
INGRAM, TEXAS.

48:40.585 --> 48:43.688
THAT SHIT SPOT'S SURE OFF
THE BEATEN PATH.

48:43.788 --> 48:47.425
WELL THEN,
LET'S BEAT US ONE THERE.

49:23.761 --> 49:26.131
( speaks Japanese)

50:08.606 --> 50:11.742
( theme music playing )
