00:00.702 --> 00:02.335
It took me a while to figure out

00:02.343 --> 00:05.286
but the key to understanding
your Uncle Barney is this.

00:05.415 --> 00:08.709
When times are hard,
it's impossible to keep him around.

00:08.900 --> 00:11.277
Like when your aunt Lily
and Uncle Marshall were broken up.

00:11.288 --> 00:13.291
Hey. What are you guys talking about?

00:13.712 --> 00:15.501
- Lily.
- I got to go.

00:17.596 --> 00:20.570
But when times are good,
it's impossible to get rid of him.

00:20.573 --> 00:21.557
What are you guys doing?

00:21.577 --> 00:23.394
We just finished planning
Marshall's bachelor party.

00:23.395 --> 00:25.370
Good, you haven't started yet.
Let's talk logistics.

00:25.384 --> 00:27.971
Now, have you laid out
ground rules with Lily?

00:27.983 --> 00:30.531
Where you are or aren't allowed
to touch or be touched?

00:30.531 --> 00:31.649
Show me on Ted.

00:31.939 --> 00:34.763
Actually, we're, uh, we're thinking
of skipping the strippers.

00:35.055 --> 00:38.360
You... you want to have a party
without strippers.

00:38.378 --> 00:40.111
This was the worse thing
I could have said.

00:40.128 --> 00:42.841
You see, uncle Barney loved
cooking up bachelor parties.

00:42.855 --> 00:44.770
And it was always the same recipe.

00:45.188 --> 00:47.791
You start with a slightly
cramped hotel suite.

00:48.198 --> 00:50.193
Arrange the chairs in a circle...

00:50.645 --> 00:52.762
Fill them with your closest friends.

00:53.205 --> 00:55.020
Turn the heat up to about 90.

00:55.378 --> 00:57.522
Pump in a metric ton of cigar smoke.

00:58.196 --> 01:01.520
And then, right in the middle
of the room, you throw in a girl.

01:01.707 --> 01:03.291
But not a beautiful girl--

01:04.068 --> 01:06.300
no, if this girl was ever beautiful,
it was two kids,

01:06.316 --> 01:09.811
three tattoos and one pesky
substance abuse problem ago.

01:10.607 --> 01:12.633
Which one of you is Stuart?

01:12.655 --> 01:14.450
Please, I really don't want to do this.

01:14.466 --> 01:17.162
Shut up, put in your mouth guard.

01:21.598 --> 01:24.441
Then she proceeds to do things
that demean the groom,

01:24.446 --> 01:27.232
herself and really,
the entire human race.

01:27.247 --> 01:28.520
Disgusting.

01:29.167 --> 01:30.492
Ah, horrifying.

01:30.997 --> 01:33.602
- Classic.
- Oh, please, please, no, no.

01:33.956 --> 01:36.142
I don't want anything like that
happening to me.

01:36.155 --> 01:37.963
Stuart's still trying
to forget that night.

01:37.976 --> 01:40.602
It's my bachelor party.
We're not having strippers.

01:40.618 --> 01:42.631
Oh, he thinks he has a sain it.

01:43.008 --> 01:44.342
So, strippers it is!

01:44.358 --> 01:48.031
Now, just, uh, tell me where we're going
to be and I'll make some calls.

01:48.315 --> 01:49.781
I think I can get
the fourth one for free.

01:49.795 --> 01:52.211
Quick question.
Prosthetic arm. Deal breaker?

01:52.845 --> 01:56.160
- Barney, there is...
- Before you say no, it has attachments.

02:10.476 --> 02:13.552
Look, I know you have some stuff planned
for Marshall's bachelor party,

02:13.556 --> 02:15.992
- but he really doesn't want strippers.
- Yes, he does.

02:16.006 --> 02:19.331
- Uh, well, he told me he doesn't.
- Uh, well, he told me he does.

02:19.348 --> 02:21.142
- When?
- Every minute of every day

02:21.156 --> 02:25.350
as his inner animal thrashes against the
cage of his own puritanical upbringing.

02:25.458 --> 02:27.802
Or do you guys not like naked girls.

02:27.817 --> 02:30.823
Um, we love naked girls.

02:30.835 --> 02:32.291
They're one of the best things
in the world.

02:32.307 --> 02:35.591
It goes... naked girls, democracy,

02:35.607 --> 02:38.641
the scene in Every Which Way But Loose
where the monkey gives a guy the finger.

02:39.086 --> 02:42.061
- We just don't like your naked girls.
- What, my girls aren't hot enough?

02:42.078 --> 02:46.481
I mean, all right, fine, the stripper at
Stuart's bachelor party was a 15.

02:46.495 --> 02:51.141
- She was 15?
- No, a 15. Like in blackjack.

02:51.536 --> 02:54.132
As in, not sure whether you'd hit it?

02:54.147 --> 02:56.201
- Exactly.
- Nice.

02:57.216 --> 03:01.562
This is important to Marshall.
So, promise me, no strippers.

03:02.137 --> 03:03.771
All right, I promise.

03:05.256 --> 03:08.983
- I'm serious.
- So am I. No strippers.

03:10.776 --> 03:12.421
Now say it without winking.

03:12.947 --> 03:14.563
No strippers.

03:16.216 --> 03:18.790
- You just winked.
- No I didn't.

03:21.376 --> 03:25.510
So, when the day arrived, we all climbed
into a rented Escalade and set out.

03:25.706 --> 03:29.653
Now, every bachelor party is usually
made up of the same stock characters.

03:29.877 --> 03:31.233
You've got the groom...

03:31.368 --> 03:32.631
the best man...

03:32.877 --> 03:36.210
- the guy who speaks only in clichÃ©s...
- Dead man walking!

03:37.478 --> 03:39.432
...the guy who disappears
at the beginning of the night

03:39.448 --> 03:41.103
and doesn't show up again until the end.

03:41.115 --> 03:44.240
All right, who's up for a little
blackjack before we check in.

03:44.647 --> 03:46.531
- No, no, no.
- None for me.

03:46.626 --> 03:48.682
See you guys back at the room, then.

03:49.475 --> 03:52.162
And, of course, well... Barney.

03:52.178 --> 03:55.873
Every bachelor party has a Barney.
Oh, what's this?

03:55.946 --> 03:58.470
This car has a DVD player?
You mean,

03:58.486 --> 04:02.732
we could have been watching
these pornos the whole time?

04:02.747 --> 04:04.812
- Yeah.
- This one's in HD.

04:05.237 --> 04:08.530
This one's in H-double-D.
Oh!

04:09.575 --> 04:12.433
That same night, aunt Lily
was having a wedding shower.

04:12.446 --> 04:14.392
And Robin showed up gift in hand.

04:14.396 --> 04:16.171
Funny story about that gift.

04:16.334 --> 04:19.072
Hey, Barney, check out
what I got Lily for her shower.

04:19.106 --> 04:21.350
It's kind of racy.
Think you can handle it?

04:21.366 --> 04:24.051
Uh, I've been in a ten-way.
So, yeah.

04:29.647 --> 04:32.591
- It's kind of see-through.
- Whoa, ho ho!

04:32.608 --> 04:35.781
You weren't kidding! You know
when you should give that to her?

04:35.806 --> 04:37.623
1850.

04:38.207 --> 04:40.270
Robin, it's her bridal shower!

04:40.286 --> 04:42.251
All her friends are gonna be there,
they're going to be drinking.

04:42.265 --> 04:44.772
You need to get her something daring,
something outrageous.

04:44.927 --> 04:47.033
Well, what do you think
I should get her?

04:47.755 --> 04:52.040
There's a store on Eighth Avenue
that specializes in--

04:52.418 --> 04:53.913
how to put this delicately?--

04:53.915 --> 04:59.480
uh, battery-powered, adult-
recreational fake penises.

05:00.878 --> 05:03.493
And so Aunt Robin went
to a store on Eighth Avenue,

05:03.507 --> 05:06.650
and a battery-powered,
adult-recreational...

05:06.675 --> 05:09.501
Well, it was something inappropriate.
And we're back in.

05:15.095 --> 05:16.330
Robin!

05:17.018 --> 05:18.292
I'm so glad you're here.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.813
Come in, I want you to meet everybody.

05:20.827 --> 05:24.091
Robin, this is my Grandma Lois
and my Aunt Florence.

05:24.107 --> 05:25.961
Oh, lovely to meet you, dear.

05:26.005 --> 05:28.032
They put this whole party together.

05:28.635 --> 05:32.173
It's different from what I expected,
but lovely.

05:32.278 --> 05:33.391
Lovely.

05:33.408 --> 05:34.842
And oh, look, there are little kids here!

05:34.858 --> 05:35.923
Yeah, my cousins.

05:35.935 --> 05:39.251
Listen, I, uh, I forgot something
somewhere so I'm going to just go...

05:39.267 --> 05:41.250
Robin, this is my mom, Janice.

05:41.268 --> 05:44.372
Oh, honey.
I'm so glad to finally meet you.

05:44.408 --> 05:46.292
Me too.
I, I've heard so much about you.

05:46.307 --> 05:49.260
Me, too. Oh, here.
Let me take your gift.

05:51.606 --> 05:55.561
Can I guess what it is?
Is it a, a, a mini food processor?

05:55.708 --> 05:57.200
- No.
- No? Oh.

05:57.277 --> 05:59.061
Oh, give me a hint.
What color is it?

06:00.056 --> 06:01.123
Black.

06:02.655 --> 06:05.450
Well, I guess I'm just going
to have to wait and see!

06:06.935 --> 06:08.741
- Oh, great.
- Robin...

06:08.777 --> 06:12.653
- this is my Cousin Margaret.
- Oh, finally, someone our own age!

06:12.927 --> 06:16.621
Wait, do I introduce you as
"Cousin Margaret" or "Sister Margaret?"

06:16.628 --> 06:19.523
Well, I'm not officially confirmed
as a nun until next month

06:19.536 --> 06:24.032
and I don't want to tick off the Big Guy,
so let's stick with "Cousin" for now.

06:24.838 --> 06:27.122
God's watching.
Excellent!

06:31.317 --> 06:33.471
Man, they spent a lot of money
on this porno.

06:33.826 --> 06:37.681
Whoa-- Morgan Freeman?
Man, that guy's in everything.

06:38.068 --> 06:41.102
Aw, man, I grabbed
the wrong Deep Impact!

06:41.976 --> 06:43.790
No, leave it in, it's a good movie.

06:43.808 --> 06:47.753
- But, dude, there's no sex in it.
- Yeah, just like marriage. Huh? Right?

06:49.175 --> 06:51.562
Oh, oh, hey, check this out!
Don't ask how,

06:51.578 --> 06:55.502
but I procured for us five loco-bueno,

06:55.515 --> 06:58.131
hand-rolled, highly illegal Cubans.

06:58.148 --> 07:00.302
Seriously, you could go to jail
for smoking these things.

07:00.305 --> 07:02.891
Marriage is like jail!
Right, fellas?!

07:04.617 --> 07:06.851
But at least in jail,
you get to have sex!

07:09.436 --> 07:13.450
But we're not lighting these babies up,
till we get to the A.C.

07:13.477 --> 07:14.541
A.C.?

07:14.608 --> 07:17.390
Um, Atlantic City.
Try to keep up, Brad.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.451
We're not going to Atlantic City.

07:21.233 --> 07:22.528
Just a second, Brad.

07:26.511 --> 07:28.239
- Hi.
- Hi.

07:29.379 --> 07:31.192
We're still going
to Atlantic City, right?

07:31.205 --> 07:34.722
Oh, did I not tell you? Yeah, we
switched it. We're going to Foxwoods.

07:34.816 --> 07:36.301
Foxwoods?

07:36.335 --> 07:42.643
But I've got an ipperstray
waiting in tlanticaay itycay.

07:42.908 --> 07:44.433
What the heck's in Foxwoods?

07:44.447 --> 07:47.652
Well, we've got five third row seats
to the Popinski-Salazar rematch.

07:47.956 --> 07:50.190
They've set aside
our very own craps table,

07:50.216 --> 07:52.200
and I reserved a private room
for us at Connelly's,

07:52.218 --> 07:54.862
where the five of us are going
to be sharing a 102-ounce steak

07:54.878 --> 07:57.323
from a cow that I picked out
on the Internet.

07:57.508 --> 08:00.000
- Yeah.
- Great. The night's ruined.

08:00.347 --> 08:03.002
Sorry, Barney.
It was an honest mistake.

08:07.085 --> 08:09.240
This is going to be great!

08:09.278 --> 08:12.503
Meat, violence,
throwing money down the toilet.

08:12.527 --> 08:14.740
America-- one;
every other country-- zero.

08:15.108 --> 08:16.803
- Thanks, guys.
- Yeah.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.602
- You okay, Barney?
- What can I say, Ted? You won.

08:21.987 --> 08:23.003
Hi.

08:23.665 --> 08:26.123
You one... sad, pathetic loser.

08:26.396 --> 08:28.773
Boys, say hello to Treasure.

08:29.245 --> 08:30.523
Hi, Treasure.

08:32.075 --> 08:34.240
- I can't believe that you did this.
- I had to.

08:34.256 --> 08:35.613
- I'm your best man.
- Ted's my best man.

08:35.626 --> 08:37.571
You've yet to make a decision
and that's fine.

08:37.587 --> 08:41.471
But as your best-man-to-be, it's my job
to make sure at your bachelor party

08:41.476 --> 08:45.310
you see a woman take her clothes off while
dancing to Whitesnake's "Here I Go Again."

08:48.955 --> 08:51.580
All right, fine, but...
let's make it fast, all right.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.332
The fight starts in an hour
we don't want to miss it.

08:53.348 --> 08:55.862
It's a girl taking her clothes off.
How long can it take?

08:55.878 --> 08:57.552
It's a bit more complicated than that.

08:57.567 --> 09:00.881
I need two grounded sockets, a large
sterile pot filled with hot water

09:00.895 --> 09:03.081
and you all need to sign these releases.

09:06.877 --> 09:11.252
An egg beater!
Aw, thank you, Aunt Sylvia!

09:11.336 --> 09:13.032
I love that it's cordless.

09:13.045 --> 09:14.793
Well, at least I got that part right.

09:15.926 --> 09:18.580
All of these gifts are so thoughtful.

09:18.966 --> 09:20.001
Lily?

09:20.287 --> 09:23.531
I need you to look at me right now
and read my mind.

09:24.237 --> 09:26.732
- Oh, my God! You're hearing me!
- Yeah!

09:27.176 --> 09:29.531
Sorry this party's so boring.
What's up?

09:29.865 --> 09:33.900
Do not open my gift.
See what I'm doing here?

09:33.916 --> 09:37.592
I'm looking over at the gift,
then back at you,

09:37.607 --> 09:40.461
and I'm shaking my head, "no."

09:40.585 --> 09:43.981
Gift. You. No.

09:44.467 --> 09:47.811
- Are you getting that?
- I totally got it.

09:54.306 --> 09:56.183
Here you go.

09:57.245 --> 09:59.863
Lily said it was your time of the month.

10:00.705 --> 10:01.993
You're welcome.

10:07.808 --> 10:08.992
What are you doing?

10:09.285 --> 10:15.023
Oh, just, um... rearranging the gifts.
The pile looked a bit precarious. So...

10:15.047 --> 10:17.283
Oh, don't worry, I'll keep an eye on it.

10:17.476 --> 10:19.481
Great. You do that.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.910
You're gonna make a damn good nun.

10:26.757 --> 10:29.322
As many times as Robin told
this story over the years,

10:29.337 --> 10:32.791
she would never quite be able
to explain the logic of her next move.

10:39.806 --> 10:41.973
Is this a strip show or a Kiss concert?

10:41.985 --> 10:44.012
Shh! She's starting.

10:44.126 --> 10:47.760
Please turn off your cell phones,
pagers and sense of shame.

10:48.577 --> 10:54.041
All right, boys. Lie back, get
comfortable, and enjoy the show.

10:58.796 --> 11:01.332
Of course there's no way
I'm telling you about her show.

11:01.357 --> 11:03.520
- So, let's skip ahead a little.
- Ow!

11:04.327 --> 11:06.631
Oh my God, are you all right?

11:06.646 --> 11:09.470
No, I am not all right, you idiot.
My ankle is broken!

11:09.518 --> 11:12.651
- Take me to the hospital!
- Um, actually, we have tickets.

11:14.806 --> 11:16.371
You know what?
Thanks a lot, Barney.

11:16.377 --> 11:17.762
She told you at the beginning of the show

11:17.777 --> 11:20.100
not to use the smoke machine
when she's on the hippity hop.

11:20.118 --> 11:22.811
Now I'm going to have to spend the rest
of my bachelor party in a hospital.

11:22.826 --> 11:24.561
Well, hey, maybe
we'll get to see her X-rays.

11:24.577 --> 11:26.460
The ultimate strip show.

11:26.475 --> 11:30.283
- X-rays. More like triple X-rays.
- Just stop.

11:32.288 --> 11:33.692
Which exit is the hospital?

11:33.706 --> 11:35.600
What if she doesn't make it
to the hospital?

11:35.626 --> 11:37.211
Barney, please calm down.

11:37.218 --> 11:38.630
Maybe we should just
take her to the desert,

11:38.636 --> 11:40.503
bury her and wash our hands
of this whole thing!

11:40.587 --> 11:42.122
Dude, what is the matter with you?

11:42.136 --> 11:44.270
I'm just trying to illustrate
to Marshall that as his best man...

11:44.287 --> 11:46.153
- You're not my best man.
- As his best man,

11:46.167 --> 11:48.010
I would help him bury
a hooker in the desert.

11:48.027 --> 11:49.912
- I'm not a hooker.
- And you're not my best man.

11:49.927 --> 11:51.573
You've ruined my bachelor party.

11:51.705 --> 11:54.520
I don't know why you wouldn't just listen
to me when I said I didn't want this.

11:54.538 --> 11:57.273
Well, the fight started ten minutes ago.
Maybe-maybe we should listen.

11:57.595 --> 11:59.210
Oh, Doctor, what a fight!

11:59.228 --> 12:01.803
That knockout will be talked about
for years to come!

12:01.815 --> 12:03.650
Anyone lucky enough to be
in the arena tonight

12:03.657 --> 12:06.422
just witnessed boxing history
in the making!

12:07.978 --> 12:12.603
Thank you so much, Margaret. I can't
believe you carved that crucifix yourself.

12:12.615 --> 12:14.193
So talented.

12:14.605 --> 12:16.243
Didn't think you could carve.

12:19.197 --> 12:23.681
For you.
Oh. And this one's from...

12:24.405 --> 12:27.130
- Grandma Lois.
- Oh. No, wait, darling.

12:28.898 --> 12:32.120
Before you open this,
I-I want to say a few words.

12:32.135 --> 12:33.860
Okay, something you need to know.

12:34.308 --> 12:38.603
Grandma Lois thought she was giving her
granddaughter an antique sewing machine.

12:39.586 --> 12:40.842
And we're back in.

12:41.226 --> 12:47.420
Honey, this handy little device has been
in our family for generations.

12:47.435 --> 12:50.302
I used it,
your great grandmother used it.

12:50.318 --> 12:54.843
Now, her mother didn't use this one,
but she used one just like it.

12:54.868 --> 12:57.553
Of course, back then,
they were made out of wood.

12:57.877 --> 13:01.553
And, uh, I guess before that,
you just had to do it by hand.

13:01.575 --> 13:04.771
- Would you pass the wine, please?
- No.

13:05.878 --> 13:07.052
Hey, Marshall,

13:07.255 --> 13:09.461
while we're here, you may as well
go down to the morgue and

13:09.475 --> 13:12.531
climb into a drawer, 'cause
that's what marriage is like.

13:12.546 --> 13:14.030
Can I get an amen?

13:16.558 --> 13:18.583
- Is everything all right at home, Stuart?
- No.

13:20.000 --> 13:26.074

13:27.577 --> 13:28.831
It's broken.

13:28.945 --> 13:33.391
Oh, damn it, this is bad.
I really can't lose this job.

13:33.776 --> 13:38.701
My daughters are about to start school,
and my fiancÃ©, well...

13:39.075 --> 13:42.830
ever since he got back from Iraq,
pretty much all he does is drink.

13:43.255 --> 13:45.401
I think about leaving him, but...

13:45.477 --> 13:49.593
I don't want my girls growing up
without a dad like I did.

13:50.006 --> 13:52.140
I don't want them
to know what that's like.

13:55.857 --> 13:58.662
- So, show time?
- What is the matter with you?

13:58.785 --> 14:00.250
Her ankle's broken.

14:00.266 --> 14:03.241
I know for a fact that
the second half of her act

14:03.255 --> 14:05.872
takes place largely
in a seated or supine position.

14:05.887 --> 14:07.131
Oh, that's true.

14:07.488 --> 14:10.441
Treasure, please,
don't worry about the show.

14:10.776 --> 14:12.173
Uh, we'd feel bad.

14:12.947 --> 14:14.210
What does that mean?

14:14.226 --> 14:16.232
No. We just mean, uh,
you're off the hook.

14:16.248 --> 14:17.562
You don't have to do it.

14:17.838 --> 14:20.410
I don't have to do it?
Well, guess what?

14:20.425 --> 14:25.141
I know I don't have to do it.
I do it because I am good at it.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.972
Look, I don't need your pity.

14:27.008 --> 14:31.071
All I want to do is give you a great show
because you're getting married!

14:31.115 --> 14:35.160
Is that so much to ask?
Is that such a major inconvenience?!

14:46.655 --> 14:47.911
Oh, that is wrong.

14:49.377 --> 14:50.773
Oh, that's just so wrong.

14:52.137 --> 14:55.600
Well, the doctor did say for her
to keep it elevated.

15:00.118 --> 15:04.113
When I was a girl, my mother taught me
and my sister to use it.

15:04.175 --> 15:07.431
We used to have contests
to see who could finish faster.

15:07.448 --> 15:11.282
It was so exciting. The whole family
would gather around to watch.

15:11.805 --> 15:16.211
And when I was a new bride,
this is what kept me buzy

15:16.228 --> 15:19.981
all those long nights when
your grandfather was in Korea.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.211
And speaking of your grandfather,

15:23.225 --> 15:27.723
though I don't think he'd care to admit
this to any of his army buddies, but...

15:28.587 --> 15:31.211
he'd have a go at it
every once in a while.

15:31.677 --> 15:33.492
And he enjoyed it.

15:34.916 --> 15:36.772
Oh, open it up, sweetie.

15:36.786 --> 15:40.130
May this give for you as much joy
as it's brought me.

16:03.416 --> 16:04.800
Grandma, um...

16:06.846 --> 16:07.682
Wow.

16:08.227 --> 16:12.310
Well, take it out, honey.
I want to show you how to use it.

16:13.867 --> 16:16.241
Okay, no, no!
Don't take it out.

16:16.578 --> 16:19.180
Lily, that's not your grandma's gift.
It's mine.

16:19.206 --> 16:23.373
I panicked, and I switched the cards
because I was embarrassed.

16:23.408 --> 16:24.933
Well, what is it?

16:34.947 --> 16:39.133
It's just like the one Miranda gave
to Charlotte on Sex and the City.

16:39.176 --> 16:42.903
Oh, I love that show.
I always watch it on TBS.

16:43.017 --> 16:45.532
Oh, you would.
You're such a Samantha!

16:45.547 --> 16:48.041
Oh, I'm a Carrie!
You're a Samantha!

16:49.368 --> 16:52.472
And then the night became
a whole new kind of uncomfortable.

16:53.775 --> 16:56.280
- So where do I get one of these?
- Mom!

16:59.907 --> 17:02.010
Man, what a show, huh?

17:02.337 --> 17:04.873
She did some disgusting stuff.
Really sticks with you.

17:06.496 --> 17:08.051
I may be done eating.

17:08.396 --> 17:09.451
Me, too.

17:09.647 --> 17:11.531
I mean, like, forever.

17:12.036 --> 17:13.080
Me, too.

17:13.575 --> 17:14.913
I miss my wife.

17:16.678 --> 17:20.200
Hey, let's go around the table
and say what our favorite part was.

17:20.308 --> 17:22.612
Mine was that thing with the typewriter.

17:22.994 --> 17:25.942
I mean, she made some
spelling mistakes, but still.

17:26.877 --> 17:29.511
Ooh, and you guys were all,
"Barney, put out the cigar!

17:29.525 --> 17:33.032
It's a non-smoking room!" And I was all,
"Hell, no, this is a Cuban!"

17:33.778 --> 17:36.401
Of course, eventually,
I did put it out.

17:37.446 --> 17:38.461
Did I put it out?

17:39.205 --> 17:40.222
I put it out.

17:41.285 --> 17:42.582
Did I put it out?

17:43.826 --> 17:45.070
I put it out.

17:46.777 --> 17:47.903
Did I put it out?

17:48.328 --> 17:52.110
It was a small fire, not even big enough
to force an evacuation of the hotel,

17:52.128 --> 17:54.160
but definitely big enough
to get us kicked out,

17:54.208 --> 17:57.080
and bring Marshall's
bachelor party to an early end.

17:57.578 --> 17:58.580
Is that...?

18:00.377 --> 18:01.601
It is.

18:06.105 --> 18:07.341
Hey, guys.

18:10.027 --> 18:11.023
How was the fight?

18:14.725 --> 18:18.153
Hey, what are you guys doing here?
What happened to the bachelor party?

18:18.166 --> 18:20.591
We missed the fight, dinner was ruined,

18:20.617 --> 18:23.801
we spent half the night in the hospital,
and got kicked out of the hotel.

18:23.887 --> 18:26.353
- What do you think happened?
- Barney. Barney.

18:26.458 --> 18:28.480
Hey, I was just trying
to be a good best man.

18:29.048 --> 18:32.091
You know what a best man does, Barney?
He does what the groom wants.

18:32.176 --> 18:35.212
But all you ever think about is
what you want, what's best for you.

18:35.228 --> 18:36.130
Best man?

18:36.207 --> 18:38.431
I'm not even sure I'm inviting you
to the wedding at this point.

18:38.508 --> 18:39.620
You don't mean that.

18:39.637 --> 18:42.580
Why should I invite you?
You don't even want us to get married.

18:45.666 --> 18:46.980
That's not true.

18:47.316 --> 18:48.620
Lily, don't.

18:49.748 --> 18:50.591
What?

18:52.655 --> 18:53.780
I'm sorry, Barney.

18:54.136 --> 18:56.652
It happened last summer
when we were broken up.

18:58.806 --> 19:00.820
Hey, what are you guys talking about?

19:01.167 --> 19:02.950
- Lily.
- Ah, I got to go.

19:08.965 --> 19:10.471
Newark Airport, please.

19:18.706 --> 19:20.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Barney, what are you doing here?

19:20.738 --> 19:22.461
I can't believe it's really you.
Come in, have a seat.

19:22.477 --> 19:24.260
Do you want some tea?
I know the apartment's small,

19:24.275 --> 19:26.233
but I don't need much space.
Let me show you some of my paintings.

19:26.236 --> 19:28.411
I think it's some of my best work ever.
Just stop it.

19:28.456 --> 19:32.261
Lily, you have to come home.
You and Marshall belong together.

19:32.305 --> 19:33.030
The two of you

19:33.038 --> 19:35.611
have something that most people search
their whole lives for and never find.

19:35.616 --> 19:38.200
I know you love him, and if you knew
what he was going through right now,

19:38.216 --> 19:40.541
you wouldn't be here
for one more second.

19:41.225 --> 19:42.742
I bought you a ticket home.

19:43.137 --> 19:45.282
Marshall is one
of the best people I know,

19:45.286 --> 19:47.432
and it won't be long until
someone else realizes that,

19:47.446 --> 19:49.042
and you'll lose him forever.

19:49.455 --> 19:50.983
I can't stand the thought
of that happening,

19:51.005 --> 19:53.712
and I cannot keep stealing
chicks from him forever.

19:54.645 --> 19:57.702
Never, ever tell anyone I was here.
I will deny it tooth and nail.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.211
This trip never happened.

20:02.707 --> 20:04.660
Hey, if you had three hours to kill
before your flight, what would you do--

20:04.675 --> 20:06.801
Alcatraz or Fisherman's Wharf?

20:11.215 --> 20:12.503
You really did that?

20:16.508 --> 20:20.412
Marshall, I think Barney's
your best man.

20:21.206 --> 20:21.992
Yeah.

20:22.215 --> 20:23.240
Yes, he is.

20:23.246 --> 20:25.720
See, Lily?
This is why I didn't...

20:26.076 --> 20:27.472
- Really?
- Really.

20:28.677 --> 20:29.601
Real...

20:29.968 --> 20:32.622
In your face, loser!

20:33.778 --> 20:36.232
Take it easy, all right.
Ted's still my best man, too.

20:36.247 --> 20:38.042
You guys are co-best men.

20:38.048 --> 20:41.332
Right.
Yes, we're both best man.

20:42.678 --> 20:45.310
No, um, seriously.
You guys are co-best men.

20:45.405 --> 20:46.693
Of course.

20:56.278 --> 20:58.102
I can't believe you got me this.

20:58.125 --> 21:01.241
Oh, I only did it as a joke.
I can return it for you you want.

21:01.248 --> 21:04.702
Oh, no, it's okay. You don't have
to go all the way back down there.

21:04.718 --> 21:06.921
- I'll, I'll just throw it away.
- Well, I mean,

21:06.935 --> 21:08.411
if you were going to throw it away,
maybe I'll take it

21:08.425 --> 21:10.972
in case I get invited
to another wedding shower.

21:10.987 --> 21:14.022
- It's a great gag gift.
- Yeah, it's really funny.

21:14.388 --> 21:16.000
You know who would get a kick out of it?

21:16.017 --> 21:16.992
Marshall.

21:17.008 --> 21:18.983
So, so maybe I'll just hold on to it.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.743
I would be embarrassed if Marshall
found out that I bought it for you,

21:22.758 --> 21:25.260
- so I'd better just take it.
- Robin, leave it.
