Shh. The jewels!

00:54.400 --> 00:58.817
Or, any can that says 5 cents
redeemable in Connecticut.

00:58.877 --> 01:00.009
But l'm still looking for jewels.

01:00.090 --> 01:00.981
Yes we know Shake.

01:01.051 --> 01:03.085
You said it a number of times
already.

01:03.165 --> 01:05.128
Well that's because
that's my preference.

01:05.197 --> 01:06.000
Meatwad:
Mine too.

01:06.070 --> 01:07.873
Jewels would be great Shake,
but right now we need money.

01:07.943 --> 01:09.406
Jewels are worth money.

01:09.476 --> 01:10.948
Mmm-hmm, lots of money.

01:11.019 --> 01:12.111
That's why l want to get married.

01:12.181 --> 01:13.954
So l can get one of them big rings.

01:15.326 --> 01:16.488
You know the man gets it now.

01:16.568 --> 01:17.760
Just get in there.

01:17.830 --> 01:21.036
Saving the environment is fun
and profitable.

01:21.106 --> 01:23.080
Meatwad!
When did you start smoking?

01:23.150 --> 01:24.622
Whoo, l don't know.

01:24.682 --> 01:26.415
But l cannot stop.

01:26.496 --> 01:28.489
lt's like a meal in a little
paper stick.

01:28.559 --> 01:29.831
Jackpot gentlemen.

01:29.902 --> 01:32.927
Stop shaking the bottle.
Come on man!

01:33.007 --> 01:34.269
Peppermint Schnapps!

01:34.349 --> 01:35.341
What the hell...

01:35.411 --> 01:36.243
Stop shaking the bottle.

01:36.313 --> 01:37.214
l shake stuff.

01:37.284 --> 01:39.388
- Come on man, what the hell!
- That's how l spell my name.

01:39.458 --> 01:40.450
lt's my roots man.

01:40.530 --> 01:41.933
lt's a real live genie.

01:42.003 --> 01:43.736
Well, my name's actually Gene.

01:43.806 --> 01:46.070
Gene E.

01:46.140 --> 01:48.274
''E'' stands for, huh,
E-ugene or something.

01:48.354 --> 01:50.317
We're gonna call you
Double Gene.

01:50.387 --> 01:52.791
Gene Squared.
Ain't that right?

01:52.862 --> 01:54.595
l'm gonna call you

01:54.665 --> 01:57.399
Oh, ok,
l don't have to call you nothing.

01:57.480 --> 01:58.772
l just thought that'd be fun.

01:58.842 --> 01:59.673
Nice story.

01:59.744 --> 02:02.308
Now grant us some wishes or
l personally will destroy you.

02:02.388 --> 02:03.821
Whoa Shake.
He doesn't do that.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.736
Yeah, sure l grant wishes,
all the time.

02:06.806 --> 02:07.828
For food.

02:07.908 --> 02:09.100
What's the problem?

02:09.169 --> 02:10.372
He's tiny and cute.

02:10.442 --> 02:11.915
He's homeless and drunk, man.

02:11.985 --> 02:13.778
How many genies you ever seen
inside of a Schnapps bottle?

02:13.858 --> 02:15.321
Calm down there, Hitler!

02:15.391 --> 02:19.268
You think Ron Howard just wished
Willow was great?

02:19.338 --> 02:22.173
No, and yet it was.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.976
Genie, l'm putting Willow in.

02:24.046 --> 02:27.422
Uh, l was saving this for my
birthday but--

02:27.492 --> 02:29.225
Yeah, well now it's mine.

02:29.295 --> 02:30.768
We could share but--

02:30.838 --> 02:33.573
that's the rest of it,
that's in your mouth now.

02:33.643 --> 02:35.376
l had some franks for protein,
to give out more wishes.

02:35.446 --> 02:37.179
l wish l was bald.

02:37.249 --> 02:39.383
Ya'll l'm bald,
he does grant wishes!

02:39.453 --> 02:40.485
He does!

02:40.565 --> 02:43.500
How many wishes do we get?

02:43.570 --> 02:46.004
12 or 3, whatever man.

02:46.074 --> 02:49.410
Let's just not put a number on
something that's so cool.

02:49.480 --> 02:50.612
Alright ya'll.

02:50.692 --> 02:51.955
Look, just don't be pissed off

02:52.025 --> 02:53.658
when he doesn't come through for
you with a wish.

02:53.728 --> 02:56.462
l wish that you were gone with
that attitude.

02:56.533 --> 02:57.665
Gene, make it happen.

02:57.745 --> 02:58.937
Wish Frylock away.

02:59.007 --> 02:59.999
Ka-bingo!

03:01.922 --> 03:03.014
Oh, boom!

03:03.084 --> 03:04.557
lt's for reals ya'll!

03:04.627 --> 03:05.819
l knew it!

03:05.899 --> 03:08.634
l'm still here Shake,
he just turned me invisible.

03:08.704 --> 03:10.176
Oh, kill him Gene.

03:10.246 --> 03:11.709
Dismiss with his life.

03:11.779 --> 03:14.013
l wish that l was Zack

03:14.083 --> 03:15.416
of The Suite Life
with Zack and Cody.

03:15.486 --> 03:17.649
Alright.

03:17.730 --> 03:18.751
Ahh.

03:18.831 --> 03:22.468
Hey ya'll, l'm living in a hotel
suite with my twin brother Cody

03:22.538 --> 03:23.570
on Nickelodeon.

03:23.650 --> 03:24.672
- Right?
- No.

03:24.752 --> 03:26.485
You're just invisible like me.

03:26.555 --> 03:29.290
Look, over time you will form
into that guy.

03:29.360 --> 03:30.832
That you just said.

03:30.903 --> 03:31.924
MEATWAD
Alright!

03:32.004 --> 03:34.339
And that castle thing will be
built all around you.

03:34.409 --> 03:35.571
- And it'll be great.
- Yeah!

03:35.641 --> 03:37.113
Now where's your money.

03:37.183 --> 03:40.209
First l require for you to do
something for me.

03:40.289 --> 03:42.262
l wrote a great screenplay.

03:42.332 --> 03:44.356
<i>lt's called Fast.</i>

03:44.436 --> 03:45.458
Wow.

03:45.538 --> 03:48.513
There's a truck load of snakes
that are on a bus.

03:48.583 --> 03:50.316
lt's sort of like Speed

03:50.386 --> 03:52.120
only the speed is faster.

03:52.190 --> 03:56.968
You have to go 155 miles
an hour.

03:57.038 --> 03:58.801
Or the bomb will go off.

03:58.871 --> 04:00.274
Who's your star?

04:00.344 --> 04:02.337
l got the title which obviously

04:02.417 --> 04:04.581
we both feel really strongly about.

04:04.661 --> 04:06.024
And l have an ending.

04:06.094 --> 04:07.286
l like it.

04:07.366 --> 04:08.388
Ka-buki.

04:08.468 --> 04:09.660
My screenplay!

04:09.740 --> 04:11.904
Oh, don't worry, it's being sold
or something.

04:11.974 --> 04:12.806
Dreamworks.

04:12.876 --> 04:14.248
But l was going to direct that piece.

04:14.318 --> 04:15.510
Boom director.

04:15.590 --> 04:18.526
Hey Frylock, guess what?

04:18.596 --> 04:19.788
l'm a director.

04:19.868 --> 04:21.339
Hey, where's the money?

04:21.401 --> 04:23.063
Frylock's sock drawer.

04:23.144 --> 04:24.005
Where's the sock drawer?

04:24.075 --> 04:26.349
Now you make me
visible right now!

04:26.419 --> 04:27.882
Uh!
Uh man, the wishes are limited.

04:27.952 --> 04:29.354
You said they were unlimited.

04:29.425 --> 04:30.987
Well now l limited them.

04:31.067 --> 04:31.929
You ain't getting
nothing more from me

04:31.999 --> 04:33.472
until you turn me visible again!

04:33.532 --> 04:35.375
Fine, whatever.

04:35.445 --> 04:37.108
Ka-da.

04:37.178 --> 04:39.051
Hooray visible.

04:39.121 --> 04:40.314
No l'm not!

04:40.394 --> 04:41.586
Yeah you are.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.389
Now give me the money.

04:43.459 --> 04:44.932
You let me out.

04:45.002 --> 04:46.023
Hey Gene.

04:46.104 --> 04:48.638
Poke some holes in the damn lid.

04:48.708 --> 04:50.271
Poke some holes in the lid, Meatwad.

04:50.351 --> 04:51.543
Meatwad ain't here.

04:51.623 --> 04:53.086
See it's Cody now,

04:53.156 --> 04:54.719
of the Suite Life
with Zack and Cody.

04:54.799 --> 04:55.630
l thought it was Zack.

04:55.700 --> 04:57.293
- lt don't matter.
- They twins.

04:57.373 --> 04:58.635
l'm on Nickelodeon.

04:58.706 --> 04:59.537
And cut!

04:59.607 --> 05:02.202
Gene baby, l'm gonna need some
more energy from you.

05:02.282 --> 05:05.517
l don't feel like you're
committing to the character.

05:05.588 --> 05:06.790
Come on, look alive.

05:06.860 --> 05:07.691
He looks dead.

05:07.761 --> 05:08.893
You didn't put air holes in the jar.

05:08.963 --> 05:11.598
We're going to put digital holes
in the jar in post.

05:11.678 --> 05:14.243
So let's move on and let's reset
the lights.

05:14.313 --> 05:15.876
There's only one thing left to do.

05:15.956 --> 05:17.689
Go on tour with Hanna Montana
and live in

05:17.759 --> 05:19.251
a hotel suite on Nickelodeon?

05:19.332 --> 05:20.163
No.

05:20.233 --> 05:22.467
We're gonna open him up and
create a visibly vaccine

05:22.537 --> 05:24.170
from his genie gland.

05:26.885 --> 05:28.357
Where's the genie gland?

05:28.417 --> 05:29.690
l honestly don't know.

05:29.760 --> 05:30.591
Do you?

05:30.661 --> 05:32.595
Hmm-mm, yeah, l do,
it's this right here.

05:32.665 --> 05:33.927
That's his foot Meatwad.

05:34.007 --> 05:35.971
No, no, not that, it's this.

05:36.041 --> 05:37.513
And that's his shoe.

05:37.583 --> 05:39.377
What if it's this one?
ls it this one?

05:39.447 --> 05:40.348
That's his little liver.

05:40.418 --> 05:42.622
- No, l don't like liver.
- Or onions.

05:42.692 --> 05:44.666
l have very specific dietary
requirements and

05:44.736 --> 05:47.471
on the bottom of my contract
because l'm Cody,

05:47.541 --> 05:48.372
... of Zack and Cody.

05:48.442 --> 05:49.915
Alright l'll shut up.
l'll shut up.

05:49.975 --> 05:51.317
Hello anyone home?

05:51.387 --> 05:52.349
Ya'll hear something?

05:52.419 --> 05:53.681
No, proceed.

05:53.752 --> 05:55.224
Shut up, shut up, listen.

05:55.294 --> 05:57.358
- Hey!
- Can anyone hear me?!

05:57.438 --> 05:58.630
lt's in there--

05:58.700 --> 05:59.902
MEATWAD
Shut up Frylock, l hear something.

05:59.972 --> 06:01.004
Hey!

06:01.074 --> 06:02.276
lt's coming from in there.

06:02.347 --> 06:03.248
Where you pointing?

06:03.318 --> 06:04.480
l'm pointing at the living room.

06:04.550 --> 06:07.085
'Cause I'm under the bed.
In the nude.

06:07.165 --> 06:10.791
Anyone see a little 3 inch dude
running around in curly shoes?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.064
Smells like Schnapps?

06:12.144 --> 06:14.578
Gonna get his ass wrapped around
his head, manually.

06:14.648 --> 06:15.910
Carl, Carl where are you?

06:15.980 --> 06:17.453
l'm down here jackass.

06:17.523 --> 06:18.455
Where are you?

06:18.525 --> 06:19.386
Oh, we're right here.

06:19.456 --> 06:21.260
But don't be alarmed,
we're just invisible.

06:21.330 --> 06:22.862
Oh, come on!

06:22.932 --> 06:24.665
That's what l asked for!

06:24.746 --> 06:26.208
Ohhh Carl, you're tiny.

06:26.278 --> 06:27.470
Oh, you think?

06:27.551 --> 06:29.985
You lost some weight and height.

06:30.055 --> 06:31.758
Jeez your breathe is awful.

06:31.828 --> 06:33.020
l will eat me some dog crap.

06:33.100 --> 06:34.663
Yeah, l know,
l've seen you do it.

06:34.733 --> 06:36.296
Mostly empty calories.

06:36.376 --> 06:37.939
lt ain't gonna keep you going
through the day.

06:38.009 --> 06:40.243
Uh, you need to find Gene.

06:40.313 --> 06:41.986
And you find him now.

06:42.056 --> 06:43.789
Carl, l'm afraid Gene's dead.

06:43.859 --> 06:45.392
l thought l could create a
visibility vaccine

06:45.462 --> 06:46.293
from his genie gland.

06:46.363 --> 06:49.399
But then l realized that l don't
know anything about genies.

06:49.479 --> 06:50.501
Do you?--
Know-- anything about--

06:50.581 --> 06:53.145
l studied elevator repair!

06:53.215 --> 06:54.247
Just asking.

06:54.327 --> 06:55.349
You know.

06:55.429 --> 06:57.553
All l wanted was
the American dream.

06:57.633 --> 07:01.540
What every immigrant wants when
he comes to our shores

07:01.610 --> 07:03.082
or over our fences.

07:03.143 --> 07:08.893
To get his rocks off
indiscreetly and invisibly for free,

07:08.963 --> 07:11.868
in woman's public restroom or
dressing area

07:11.938 --> 07:13.461
of a lingerie shop.

07:13.541 --> 07:17.488
And now that dream is no more.

07:17.558 --> 07:19.020
Wipe those tears Carl.

07:19.090 --> 07:22.797
Your story's too important to
America.

07:22.867 --> 07:25.301
This is the jackpot,
they didn't see us at all.

07:25.371 --> 07:26.814
You know how long it --

07:26.874 --> 07:28.216
Shh! Carl!

07:28.286 --> 07:31.081
The key is absolute silence.

07:31.161 --> 07:33.596
Like a filthy predator creeping
in the reeds.

07:33.666 --> 07:37.332
As the big boobed crane flies
ever closer.

07:37.412 --> 07:38.574
Yeah, but here's the thing,
you know

07:38.644 --> 07:40.838
some times they'll come in here
to talk,

07:40.918 --> 07:41.910
l know that.

07:41.990 --> 07:43.954
They don't always do number 2.

07:44.024 --> 07:45.967
So we got to lure them into the stall.

07:46.027 --> 07:48.231
And then lure their dresses off.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.173
lt doesn't matter.

07:49.243 --> 07:52.268
Soon as they hear these drips,
they're gonna need to go.

07:52.348 --> 07:53.821
This is basic science.

07:53.881 --> 07:57.227
You stay in the toilet bowl,
that's where the action is.

07:57.297 --> 07:58.319
Good call.

07:58.399 --> 08:00.032
See, it's like a pool to you.

08:00.102 --> 08:02.336
You think uh--
think they'll see the camera?

08:02.406 --> 08:03.277
Shh! They're coming.

08:03.348 --> 08:04.249
Hand me the camera.

08:04.319 --> 08:05.842
Let me get here so l can let this go.

08:05.922 --> 08:07.014
- Oh, really?
- Yeah--

08:07.084 --> 08:08.817
Show it to me baby!

08:08.897 --> 08:10.360
Yeah, there it is!

08:10.430 --> 08:11.462
Yeah.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.265
Carl, l got some footage.

08:13.335 --> 08:14.367
Alright, yeah!

08:14.447 --> 08:17.212
No! No! No!

08:17.282 --> 08:18.113
Carl?

08:20.127 --> 08:21.289
Carl?

08:22.601 --> 08:24.334
The walls are so smooth.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.378
Thank god for this used tampon.

08:26.438 --> 08:29.173
Check this out, the toilet
operates on laser beams.

08:29.253 --> 08:32.589
No! No! No!

08:32.659 --> 08:34.392
Like Star Wars in here.

08:34.462 --> 08:36.936
This is how Darth Vader craps!

08:37.006 --> 08:39.481
Genies are usually known to live
in bottles.

08:39.541 --> 08:42.515
Because of alcoholic tendencies
that run in genie families.

08:42.586 --> 08:45.321
Often genies will turn other
people into little genies

08:45.391 --> 08:50.169
so they can have someone like
them to drink with.

08:50.239 --> 08:51.261
Carl.

08:51.341 --> 08:52.503
Oh, he's gone man.

08:52.583 --> 08:53.475
Whoa! Whoa, Shake.

08:53.545 --> 08:54.777
l flushed him down the toilet.

08:54.857 --> 08:55.819
No, he was a genie.

08:55.889 --> 08:57.582
Damn it,
he could have turned us visible.

08:57.662 --> 08:58.995
And how long have you
been over there?

08:59.065 --> 08:59.896
Look at this.

08:59.966 --> 09:04.434
Haunted hair dryer,
coming to fluff you abnormal.

09:04.514 --> 09:05.987
Shake, cut that out.

09:06.047 --> 09:07.519
Don't you worry Frylock,

09:07.590 --> 09:10.615
l done developed these special
glasses in my science lab.

09:10.695 --> 09:14.932
See l can see myself and my nose
for when l'm picking on my--

09:15.013 --> 09:16.034
my boogers.

09:16.114 --> 09:18.078
These are toilet tubes.

09:18.148 --> 09:19.480
Give 'em back to me.

09:19.550 --> 09:21.023
They weren't calibrated right--

09:21.093 --> 09:22.065
They still don't work Meatwad.

09:22.125 --> 09:24.689
Then where did l find all of
these boogers then, huh?

09:24.770 --> 09:27.574
l need boogers to live,
and put boogers in food.

09:27.645 --> 09:29.167
We got to find Carl.

09:29.247 --> 09:31.411
He's the only one who can turn
us visible again.

09:31.491 --> 09:33.214
l know what we'll do.

09:33.294 --> 09:35.418
The faucet lures them
into the toilet.

09:35.498 --> 09:37.231
Makes them want to go.

09:37.301 --> 09:39.746
That's when Meatwad rolls
in with his camera

09:39.806 --> 09:43.342
focusing only on the butts.

09:44.494 --> 09:46.658
Meatwad.

09:46.728 --> 09:48.030
l know you're here.

09:49.072 --> 09:51.366
You have any idea how long l was
waiting for you

09:51.446 --> 09:53.309
at that restaurant?

09:53.379 --> 09:54.401
Huh?

09:54.481 --> 09:56.815
Answer me.

09:58.328 --> 10:00.802
Haunted hair dryer.

10:00.862 --> 10:01.964
Vroom!

10:02.435 --> 10:05.781
You know how long l was waiting
for you at home?

10:05.851 --> 10:06.783
ls that--

10:06.853 --> 10:08.215
ls that you in the floating
underwear?

10:08.285 --> 10:09.117
Yeah.

10:09.187 --> 10:10.089
You're gonna get us arrested.

10:10.159 --> 10:12.132
Shut up,
we just found Carl, look.

10:12.202 --> 10:14.636
Someone needs to give him
mouth to mouth.

10:14.707 --> 10:16.440
l'm not touching those lips.

10:16.510 --> 10:17.982
l don't know CPR.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.675
Well someone needs to do it.

10:19.755 --> 10:22.049
<i>Then some one should do it.</i>

10:22.130 --> 10:22.961
Don't look at me.

10:23.031 --> 10:25.325
You have no idea where l'm looking.

10:25.405 --> 10:27.599
Well fine, l guess we'll just
wear underwear

10:27.669 --> 10:28.901
the rest of our lives then, huh?

10:28.982 --> 10:30.815
That sounds like paradise to me.

10:30.885 --> 10:33.149
Oh it does,
l want a zebra print thong.

10:33.219 --> 10:34.922
And l'm gonna buy it right now.

10:34.992 --> 10:35.894
You go through my sock drawer?

10:35.964 --> 10:37.096
l thought you were dead.

10:37.166 --> 10:37.997
Come on.

10:38.067 --> 10:39.500
l think l need a change of underwear.

10:39.570 --> 10:41.063
Stripes are slimming,

10:41.143 --> 10:43.116
but just for the record you want
to make sure

10:43.186 --> 10:44.679
you wear those on the outside.

10:44.759 --> 10:46.091
ls this like a racing stripe?

10:46.161 --> 10:47.824
Yeah, those are racing stripes.

10:47.894 --> 10:50.459
lf you consider diarrhea
to be a sport.

10:50.539 --> 10:52.703
That's how l got it for so cheap
at the store.

10:52.773 --> 10:54.306
lt was pre-skidded

10:54.376 --> 10:55.317
Pre-skidded?

10:55.388 --> 10:57.952
By who?
From the bum factory?

10:58.022 --> 10:59.324
What are you doing?

10:59.395 --> 11:00.256
No, no, no wait.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.330
No! No! No! No! No!
