<i>Previously on</i> Wayward Pines...
We should have a baby.

00:03.938 --> 00:05.104
I found trauma

00:05.106 --> 00:06.972
possibly from
the creature attack.

00:06.974 --> 00:08.107
Possibly from something else.

00:08.109 --> 00:09.208
I can't have children

00:09.210 --> 00:10.442
Are you sure?

00:10.444 --> 00:13.212
(growling loudly)

00:13.214 --> 00:14.613
They are surrounding us.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.515
There are more of them
every minute.

00:16.517 --> 00:19.218
This experiment ends now.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.220
(screeches)
(growls)

00:21.222 --> 00:23.622
Hey, think about it!
If you kill her, we all die!

(screeches)

00:31.232 --> 00:33.065
(panting)

00:33.067 --> 00:34.200
She dug from outside

00:34.201 --> 00:35.334
until she intersected
the drainage pipe.

00:35.336 --> 00:36.969
(screeching in the distance)

00:36.971 --> 00:38.370
They're gonna kill us all.

All-American lacrosse player

I'm planning a long trip.

What are they gathering for?

02:58.379 --> 03:00.679
It looks like Margaret.

03:00.681 --> 03:02.681
She might be back
with the other females, but...

03:05.619 --> 03:07.853
You should see this.

03:07.855 --> 03:09.488
She might be dying.

03:09.490 --> 03:10.656
She's not their only female.

03:10.658 --> 03:12.524
And if she was the leader
and she does die,

03:12.526 --> 03:13.625
then they'll just
pick another one.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.294
Just like if we
blow up their tunnels,

03:15.296 --> 03:17.296
they'll dig another one. If she is
dying, it might buy us more time.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.565
How much more time, Kerry?

03:19.567 --> 03:21.533
Only one way out.

03:21.535 --> 03:24.636
Get CJ and Dr. Yedlin.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.585
Come on.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.853
She made her choice, pal.

04:14.855 --> 04:16.755
And I don't need another one of
your lectures...

04:16.757 --> 04:18.590

You can invite me to your, uh...
anniversary party.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.300
Baby shower.

04:30.537 --> 04:33.472
Look, I don't know how much time
we have left.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.574
It could be days.
It could be hours.

04:35.576 --> 04:37.576
But whatever it is,
I'm not gonna live it

04:37.578 --> 04:39.711
with that kid in charge.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.813
So what I need to know

04:41.815 --> 04:43.749
is where you stand.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.250
I don't matter.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.386
No you don't. (chuckles)

04:47.388 --> 04:49.388
At all.

04:49.390 --> 04:52.391
But I want this to go smoothly.

04:52.393 --> 04:54.259
You can help with that.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.761
But,

04:55.763 --> 04:57.963
I'm doing this
with or without you.

05:01.935 --> 05:04.269
I won't be a problem.

05:04.271 --> 05:06.938
But I don't
exactly understand the plan.

05:06.940 --> 05:09.775
They just got
their leader back, right?

05:09.777 --> 05:10.776
There's a million
of 'em out there,

05:10.778 --> 05:11.977
at least that's
what everyone thinks.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.846
They can dig tunnels,
they can make ladders.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.748
It's not a question
of "if" anymore.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.450
It's a question of "when."

05:18.452 --> 05:20.752
So, I'll support you.

05:20.754 --> 05:23.422
Regime change?
Yeah, I'm all for it.

05:23.424 --> 05:26.458
But what is the plan, Theo?

05:26.460 --> 05:28.260
Do you have
some secret strategy?

05:28.262 --> 05:30.295
some magic pill to cure the
disease, (car door closes)

05:30.297 --> 05:32.431
to make all
our problems go away?

05:32.433 --> 05:34.666
Or is this just
about your tombstone

05:34.668 --> 05:36.435
and writing something
different on it?

05:36.437 --> 05:38.003
CJ:
Dr. Yedlin.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.441
He wants to see us
in the Mountain.

05:48.949 --> 05:51.016
We have a month of food.

05:52.953 --> 05:56.288
We don't have medicine
if people get sick.

05:56.290 --> 05:58.457
There are thousands of them

05:58.459 --> 06:00.392
right outside the fence.

06:00.394 --> 06:03.562
And now that they
have their leader back,

06:03.564 --> 06:05.630
they can attack us
at any moment.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.468
We could accept our fate.

06:11.372 --> 06:14.873
Tell the people
of Wayward Pines.

06:14.875 --> 06:18.310
Give them a chance to
get their affairs in order,

06:18.312 --> 06:20.712
cling to each other,
say their good-byes.

06:20.714 --> 06:23.749
Await the inevitable.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.585
Or we can fight them.

06:26.587 --> 06:29.588
There's one advantage
we still have.

06:31.358 --> 06:32.858
Pilcher.

06:32.860 --> 06:35.594
He believed.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.429
And he brought us all here
in the first place

06:37.431 --> 06:39.998
because of that belief.

06:40.000 --> 06:42.734
Wrong amount of time.

06:42.736 --> 06:44.336
The right idea.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.571
The pods?

06:46.573 --> 06:49.908
We will return here

06:49.910 --> 06:51.343
to the Mountain,

06:51.345 --> 06:52.444
where we were all reborn.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.880
As quickly as possible.

06:54.882 --> 06:57.516
No.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.618
We'll go back to sleep.

06:59.620 --> 07:01.787
All of us.

07:06.527 --> 07:08.026
PILCHER:
<i> For years,</i>

07:08.028 --> 07:10.896
we tried the old-fashioned way
so many times.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.598
It's my fault,
it was her fault...

07:13.600 --> 07:15.434
Who knows?

07:15.436 --> 07:18.770
Nowadays, of course,
when nature fails,

07:18.772 --> 07:21.606
there are so many new methods.

07:21.608 --> 07:25.510
It makes you yearn
for an earlier age.

07:27.314 --> 07:29.014
So here I am.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.851
Alone.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.587
You see,

07:35.589 --> 07:39.925
I want to leave a legacy.

07:39.927 --> 07:42.027
No, not of wealth or titles.

07:44.932 --> 07:48.066
A legacy of service
and future leadership.

07:48.068 --> 07:50.969
A legacy of-of love.

07:52.606 --> 07:54.506
Unconditional love.

07:57.110 --> 07:59.878
For humanity.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.837
Hello, Abigail.

08:28.175 --> 08:30.709
You're older than I thought.

08:30.711 --> 08:33.111
(chuckles)

08:33.113 --> 08:35.180
How are you feeling?

08:35.182 --> 08:38.116
I mean...

08:38.118 --> 08:39.985
it's hard to get around and all,

08:39.987 --> 08:43.455
and my interview
at Princeton's on hold.

08:43.457 --> 08:46.558
But I'm handling it.

08:49.062 --> 08:51.730
That's<i> Animal Farm. </i>
Yeah.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.398
Senior year summer reading.

08:53.400 --> 08:55.567
They're making us.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.469
(grunts)

08:58.572 --> 08:59.838
Well,

08:59.840 --> 09:02.908
there's worse things you
could be made to do.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.044
(chuckles softly)

09:06.046 --> 09:08.013
"Up there, comrades,

09:08.015 --> 09:11.149
"up there, just on the other
side of that dark cloud

09:11.151 --> 09:13.218
"that you can see,

09:13.220 --> 09:14.653
"there it lies,

09:15.656 --> 09:17.122
"Sugarcandy Mountain.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.762
"That happy country where we
poor animals shall rest forever

09:23.764 --> 09:26.164
from our labors."

09:28.502 --> 09:30.735
"The creatures outside
looked from pig to man,

09:30.737 --> 09:35.440
"and from man to pig,
and from pig to man again,

09:35.442 --> 09:38.910
but it was already impossible
to say which was which."

09:38.912 --> 09:41.746
Well, yes,

09:41.748 --> 09:44.816
but it's actually
quite idealistic.

09:45.919 --> 09:47.752
At the beginning.

09:47.754 --> 09:48.820
Did you finish it?

09:50.924 --> 09:53.925
Sometimes rules are good.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.795
Essential, even.

09:56.797 --> 09:57.796
It's...

09:57.798 --> 09:59.097
an allegory.

09:59.099 --> 10:01.266
So it doesn't mean anything.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.802
Maybe 20 years ago it did.

10:03.804 --> 10:04.936
Or 20 years from now,

10:04.938 --> 10:08.006
20,000 years from now, but...

10:09.977 --> 10:11.910
This doesn't describe my world.

10:11.912 --> 10:14.579
Not yet.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.948
Well...

10:16.950 --> 10:20.719
it was good
to meet you, Abigail.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.554
Thank you.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.189
For your time.

10:28.295 --> 10:29.794
Jason.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.370
That's what I call him.

10:43.910 --> 10:47.345
(grunting, shrieking)

10:58.859 --> 11:01.660
(phones ringing)

11:10.604 --> 11:13.271
Good morning.

11:13.273 --> 11:16.007
As leader of this town

11:16.009 --> 11:17.876
I've been many things.

11:17.878 --> 11:20.278
But I've strived to be
one thing above all:

11:20.280 --> 11:23.181
honest.

11:23.183 --> 11:26.618
I've been honest to you
about what this place is,

11:26.620 --> 11:29.788
where we are, who we are.

11:29.790 --> 11:33.224
And I'm gonna be honest
with you now.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.293
Our enemy has moved close.

11:35.295 --> 11:39.297
In numbers
we've never seen before.

11:39.299 --> 11:40.965
We don't know
what they're planning.

11:45.172 --> 11:46.938
But we have to assume the worst.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.842
That an invasion is imminent.

11:50.844 --> 11:52.577
(crowd murmuring)

11:52.579 --> 11:54.679
And so we need to begin
the immediate evacuation

11:54.681 --> 11:57.348
of Wayward Pines
for your own protection.

11:57.350 --> 11:58.917
(crowd grows louder)

11:58.919 --> 12:01.753
Fortunately,
there is a plan in place.

12:01.755 --> 12:04.322
Shortly after
this meeting is over,

12:04.324 --> 12:05.423
we will begin the process

12:05.425 --> 12:07.025
of moving the residents

12:07.027 --> 12:08.760
of Wayward Pines
back to the Mountain,

12:08.762 --> 12:10.228
where we will go back to sleep

12:10.230 --> 12:12.230
until the Abby
threat is contained.

12:13.600 --> 12:15.767
It's safe, it's safe,

12:15.769 --> 12:17.235
it's all very safe.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.070
And it's the only way.

12:19.072 --> 12:20.839
For how long?

12:20.841 --> 12:23.208
100 years?

12:23.210 --> 12:24.209
100,000 years?

12:24.211 --> 12:26.077
(crowd murmurs in agreement)

12:26.079 --> 12:27.679
That is still
being decided, ma'am.

12:27.681 --> 12:29.047
And then what happens?

12:29.048 --> 12:30.414
We should go the Mountain now!

12:30.417 --> 12:32.250
(crowd yells in agreement)
No.

12:32.252 --> 12:34.252
There's over a thousand of you.

12:34.254 --> 12:37.122
We need an orderly system.

12:37.124 --> 12:39.090
So please go home
and wait for instructions.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.925
We will come for you.

12:40.927 --> 12:42.327
(crowd continues murmuring)

12:46.767 --> 12:49.234
CJ: It took Pilcher
and his scientists decades

12:49.236 --> 12:50.301
to perfect the process.

12:50.303 --> 12:52.370
But with the volcanic sand

12:52.372 --> 12:54.239
and the use of sulfur gas
to kill the bacteria,

12:54.241 --> 12:56.407
it's all very safe.

12:56.409 --> 12:58.910
So you're dead
when you're in it.

12:58.912 --> 13:01.880
Not dead.

13:01.882 --> 13:03.281
We turn you off

13:03.283 --> 13:04.983
so we can
turn you back on again.

13:04.985 --> 13:07.452
And I'll be there to
make sure you are safe.

13:07.454 --> 13:08.453
Your sister,

13:08.455 --> 13:11.089
everyone, every step of the way.

13:11.091 --> 13:13.725
I know it seems strange
to some of you.

13:13.727 --> 13:16.261
You were born here.

13:16.263 --> 13:19.764
You've never known anything
but Wayward Pines.

13:19.766 --> 13:22.000
But I've spent more time
in and out of these pods

13:22.002 --> 13:23.434
than any of you.

13:23.436 --> 13:25.103
Even Pilcher.

13:25.105 --> 13:28.773
Asleep, awake, awake, asleep.

13:28.775 --> 13:31.075
And look at me.
I'm not damaged at all, am I?

13:31.077 --> 13:32.977
(students laugh)

13:32.979 --> 13:35.313
Do you dream?

13:38.985 --> 13:41.019
Sometimes.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.054
(machines humming)

13:53.300 --> 13:56.067
(beeping)

13:57.938 --> 13:59.571
(trills)

14:06.012 --> 14:07.512
(trills)

14:26.900 --> 14:28.800
We have a problem.

14:31.606 --> 14:33.873
CJ:
We ran a fuel test this morning.

14:33.875 --> 14:35.808
And?
And we're ready to go.

14:35.810 --> 14:37.377
We even have a few empty pods,

14:37.379 --> 14:38.745
if you have any
last-minute ideas.

14:38.747 --> 14:42.415
(chuckles)

14:42.417 --> 14:43.616
Ten days to spare.

14:43.618 --> 14:45.585
Thank you, Christopher.

14:45.587 --> 14:47.654
And have we decided
on the exact positions...

14:47.656 --> 14:49.555
(phone ringing)
Oh, excuse me.

14:51.493 --> 14:52.625
Hello.

14:52.627 --> 14:53.826
(woman speaking indistinctly
over phone)

14:53.828 --> 14:54.994
Speaking.

14:58.933 --> 15:00.400
What do you mean?

15:04.639 --> 15:06.406
When?

15:11.413 --> 15:12.645
Of course.

15:12.647 --> 15:14.347
WOMAN (over phone):
We'll be in touch.

15:14.349 --> 15:15.715
Of course.

15:16.518 --> 15:18.017
I'm glad she's okay.

15:20.288 --> 15:24.957
Please give my best regards
to Abigail and her parents.

15:24.959 --> 15:26.292
(phone beeps)

15:26.294 --> 15:27.827
So, should we move
up the departure

15:27.829 --> 15:32.665
or stick with the
current schedule?

15:32.667 --> 15:34.500
David?

15:34.502 --> 15:36.669
We still have a few days.

15:40.542 --> 15:42.608
He was the bridge.

15:43.945 --> 15:46.012
He was perfect.

15:47.682 --> 15:49.682
All children are perfect

15:49.684 --> 15:52.318
only if we can teach
them well.

15:52.320 --> 15:54.687
You can find another one.

15:54.689 --> 15:56.756
I'm running out of time.

15:58.293 --> 16:01.561
JASON:
You're sure about this?

16:01.563 --> 16:02.895
The empty pods
have to be charged.

16:02.897 --> 16:05.531
We tripled the voltage
at the fence.

16:05.533 --> 16:06.833
We've been running
the superstructure,

16:06.835 --> 16:09.836
this entire town
off the core reactor.

16:09.838 --> 16:11.838
Nothing's been funneled here.

16:11.840 --> 16:14.040
So they're not charged at all?
Some of them are.

16:14.042 --> 16:16.676
But some of them don't have
the energy we'll need.

16:16.678 --> 16:19.579
We put people in them,
into suspension,

16:19.581 --> 16:20.747
they won't survive.

16:20.749 --> 16:22.315
Why didn't you check this?

16:22.317 --> 16:23.316
We made an announcement...

16:23.318 --> 16:24.984
I started the tests
as soon I could.

16:24.986 --> 16:26.686
How many do we have?

16:26.688 --> 16:27.987
How many pods
are actually working?

16:27.989 --> 16:30.490
How many lives can I save?

16:30.492 --> 16:32.725
571.

16:35.497 --> 16:36.896
(Abby grunts)

16:50.678 --> 16:52.578
Hi.

16:52.580 --> 16:55.715
We're ready.

16:55.717 --> 16:57.049
Excuse me?

16:57.051 --> 17:00.052
We're ready to go back to sleep.

17:00.054 --> 17:01.087
Go home.

17:01.089 --> 17:03.823
We'll come get you
when it's time.

17:06.761 --> 17:08.361
That's okay, we'll...

17:08.363 --> 17:09.429
we'll wait here.

17:11.966 --> 17:14.367
(indistinct chatter)

17:22.911 --> 17:25.044
Dr. Yedlin.
Trying to find

17:25.046 --> 17:27.146
in all these piles a shred of
something that's gonna help.

17:27.148 --> 17:28.948
Let me ask you something,

17:28.950 --> 17:31.050
have you even thought about

17:31.052 --> 17:32.952
how long you want to put
everyone to sleep,

17:32.954 --> 17:34.821
or are you just...

17:34.823 --> 17:36.122
spin the dial
and see what happens?

17:36.124 --> 17:37.790
Dr. Yedlin, I need you to stop
what you're doing,

17:37.792 --> 17:39.792
and I need you to do something else.
(scoffs)

17:39.794 --> 17:40.893
I need basic
medical assessments

17:40.895 --> 17:42.662
of the people in
Wayward Pines.

17:42.664 --> 17:44.130
Physicals?
Yes.

17:44.132 --> 17:45.631
Just review the
files that you have.

17:45.633 --> 17:47.467
Of everyone in this town?

17:47.469 --> 17:48.935
Look for preexisting conditions.

17:48.937 --> 17:51.070
Maybe, um... a simple
score, one to five,

17:51.072 --> 17:53.506
something like that?

17:53.508 --> 17:55.007
I'll need it in
the next few hours.

17:55.009 --> 17:56.609
Do the best you can.

17:56.611 --> 17:58.077
We can't start
the evacuation without it.

17:58.079 --> 18:00.713
You can't take everyone,
can you?

18:03.985 --> 18:06.085
You want to know what kind
of shape they're in

18:06.087 --> 18:09.055
so you can decide who you take
and who you leave behind to die.

18:11.526 --> 18:13.493
Not all the pods are working.

18:13.495 --> 18:16.629
We won't be able to take
everyone, we can only take...

18:16.631 --> 18:18.965
just over half.

18:18.967 --> 18:21.534
Only you and CJ know.

18:21.536 --> 18:23.469
I need to make selections.

18:23.471 --> 18:25.872
(scoffs)
No.

18:27.008 --> 18:29.008
Has to be a lottery.

18:29.010 --> 18:31.644
It's the only fair
and ethical choice.

18:31.646 --> 18:34.814
There are people who are
essential, Doctor.

18:34.816 --> 18:35.982
Like you, for example.

18:35.984 --> 18:38.618
What if we did a lottery
and you were left behind?

18:38.620 --> 18:40.186
Then I'd accept it.

18:40.188 --> 18:43.756
It harms the greater good.

18:45.994 --> 18:47.727
We'll take all the First
Generation, of course,

18:47.729 --> 18:48.728
but we need people

18:48.730 --> 18:49.996
with valuable skills.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.797
Skills that we can use
to rebuild civilization.

18:51.799 --> 18:54.500
You mean no troublemakers,
no defectives.

18:54.502 --> 18:57.970
Yes.

18:57.972 --> 18:59.038
Well, if it's so simple,

18:59.040 --> 19:00.740
then you're not gonna
need my help.

19:00.742 --> 19:02.909
I'm not saying this is fun,
Dr. Yedlin.

19:07.682 --> 19:09.815
Are all the First Generation--

19:09.817 --> 19:11.717
are they valuable
because they're young?

19:11.719 --> 19:14.720
Their-their youth?

19:14.722 --> 19:16.923
Or...

19:16.925 --> 19:20.560
do you judge them
on their intellect,

19:20.562 --> 19:23.162
physical ability, their size?

19:23.164 --> 19:26.766
No troublemakers, no, sir.

19:26.768 --> 19:28.901
If you'd like to form
a committee and submit a report

19:28.903 --> 19:29.902
in three months,

19:29.904 --> 19:31.070
be my guest.

19:31.072 --> 19:33.172
We'll all be dead by then.

19:33.174 --> 19:35.575
I guess in the meantime,

19:35.577 --> 19:36.943
I'll make the decisions myself.

19:36.945 --> 19:38.578
Defectives.

19:38.580 --> 19:40.146
Don't forget the defectives.

19:41.950 --> 19:43.549
And I suppose
you mean by that

19:43.551 --> 19:47.553
the, uh, physically disabled,
the mentally diminished.

19:47.555 --> 19:50.122
I guess in your calculus
that's the easiest call to make.

19:56.197 --> 19:58.164
Of course...

19:59.801 --> 20:03.636
...if someone is unwilling

20:03.638 --> 20:05.137
or unable to reproduce,

20:05.139 --> 20:08.274
certainly they're a defective.

20:08.276 --> 20:10.042
I mean, that's simple, right?
That's black and white.

20:10.044 --> 20:11.043
You can...

20:11.045 --> 20:14.213
or you can't.

20:14.215 --> 20:15.982
Unless of course

20:15.984 --> 20:20.052
that defective is
someone you love.

20:20.054 --> 20:22.822
You know Pilcher
wouldn't take her.

20:22.824 --> 20:25.257
She can't fulfill her
"grand obligation."

20:25.259 --> 20:27.126
He'd leave her here to die.

20:27.128 --> 20:30.997
But perhaps her death
won't be so...

20:30.999 --> 20:32.231
painful.

20:52.286 --> 20:53.753
Rebecca asked to see you.

20:53.755 --> 20:56.088
She's completed the inventory
of the building supplies

20:56.090 --> 20:58.591
and has some rough projections
about what might be out there

20:58.593 --> 21:00.393
when we wake up.
Great.

21:02.864 --> 21:04.230
Everything okay?

21:16.144 --> 21:18.210
Any luck?
Not yet.

21:19.213 --> 21:21.714
Kerry?

21:22.984 --> 21:24.884
There's a problem with the pods.

21:28.356 --> 21:31.157
We can only take
roughly half the people.

21:31.159 --> 21:33.459
He's going to make
the selections right now.

21:36.898 --> 21:38.330
I'll go talk to him.

21:38.332 --> 21:41.067
We should start
the evacuation as planned.

21:41.069 --> 21:42.668
Then we'll just...

21:42.670 --> 21:44.003
stop at some point.

21:44.005 --> 21:45.905
Secure the entrance to the
Mountain and that's that.

21:45.907 --> 21:48.674
You will just do whatever
it takes, won't you?

21:48.676 --> 21:50.176
What good does telling
anyone really do?

21:50.178 --> 21:52.144
Maybe they should know the truth.
Truth?

21:52.146 --> 21:53.879
What good has truth done
anyone here?

21:53.881 --> 21:54.880
It's life or death,

21:54.882 --> 21:56.315
Doctor.

21:56.317 --> 21:58.951
He's not taking defectives.

22:00.888 --> 22:02.054
He said that?

22:06.094 --> 22:07.259
Did he...
I tried

22:07.261 --> 22:08.828
to tell him
how valuable you were,

22:08.830 --> 22:10.696
but you know him.

22:10.698 --> 22:14.200
He just... doesn't listen,
does he?

22:14.202 --> 22:15.901
He's giving you
a death sentence.

22:15.903 --> 22:18.671
You can't sit still for that.
I'm sure I can find a way...

22:18.673 --> 22:21.240
Take him out.

22:22.944 --> 22:25.077
I can't do that.

22:26.447 --> 22:28.447
I won't.

22:28.449 --> 22:30.850
(scoffs)

22:30.852 --> 22:34.019
Sad irony of Wayward Pines.

22:34.021 --> 22:37.490
You starve to death
or you get eaten alive.

22:40.962 --> 22:42.962
He loves me.

22:46.234 --> 22:48.701
He loves Pilcher more.

22:52.306 --> 22:53.439
REBECCA:
<i> There'll still be some</i>

22:53.441 --> 22:54.974
foundations left,

22:54.976 --> 22:56.776
to help us give
the town some sort

22:56.778 --> 22:58.277
of a layout.

22:58.279 --> 23:00.479
But there'll be
100 other variables.

23:00.481 --> 23:04.283
For instance, climate change
and the evolution of creatures.

23:04.285 --> 23:06.485
Are you all right, Jason?

23:08.156 --> 23:09.955
I'm sorry.

23:11.893 --> 23:13.325
Just got a lot on my mind.

23:15.062 --> 23:17.229
Of course.

23:17.231 --> 23:19.098
Getting everyone up here.

23:19.100 --> 23:20.733
Getting them all settled.

23:20.735 --> 23:22.968
A thousand people

23:22.970 --> 23:26.739
don't just move
themselves.

23:26.741 --> 23:28.207
I heard that you're expecting.

23:31.279 --> 23:33.312
Yeah, that's right.

23:33.314 --> 23:34.446
That's wonderful, Rebecca.

23:34.448 --> 23:36.782
It really is
the most important way

23:36.784 --> 23:38.317
one can contribute,
isn't it?

23:38.319 --> 23:40.019
It's one of the ways.

23:40.021 --> 23:41.253
It's an important one,
of course,

23:41.255 --> 23:43.422
but it's not the most important.

23:43.424 --> 23:47.426
Well, the rules say that everything...
Enough with the rules, Jason.

23:47.428 --> 23:49.128
No one's pointing
a gun to your head

23:49.130 --> 23:50.763
and forcing you
to do anything.

23:50.765 --> 23:53.833
Sometimes you just have to do
what your heart tells you to.

23:53.835 --> 23:57.036
You're right.

23:57.038 --> 23:58.537
You do.

24:01.709 --> 24:03.275
I'll finish this up
and come back later.

24:03.277 --> 24:05.311
You should go home.

24:05.313 --> 24:07.479
For a little while.

24:07.481 --> 24:08.814
See him.

24:08.816 --> 24:10.482
Say good-bye.

24:10.484 --> 24:12.885
To the town.

24:17.325 --> 24:19.058
Thank you, Rebecca.

24:19.060 --> 24:24.396
Thank you for giving
birth to all this.

24:24.398 --> 24:28.534
And for being such a productive
member of Wayward Pines.

24:31.072 --> 24:32.972
Bye, Jason.

24:32.974 --> 24:34.874
(door closes)

24:34.876 --> 24:35.908
(babies crying)

24:35.910 --> 24:37.943
(nurse speaks indistinctly)

24:52.093 --> 24:55.261
The hospital appreciates your
generous donation, Doctor.

24:55.263 --> 24:57.162
Obviously the needs of a
public hospital are many,

24:57.164 --> 24:58.430
so we can discuss

24:58.432 --> 25:01.333
naming rights, but
there's also certain shortages

25:01.335 --> 25:02.534
of basic equipment...

25:02.536 --> 25:04.236
Whatever you feel is best.

25:04.238 --> 25:07.172
But, Dr. Pilcher... I just need
to get these papers signed.

25:08.509 --> 25:12.011
Or whatever's necessary to get
this thing done tonight.

25:13.414 --> 25:15.014
Okay.

25:15.016 --> 25:16.515
I just know that
some of the members

25:16.517 --> 25:17.883
of the board
would like to...

25:17.885 --> 25:19.418
I don't have any time.

25:23.291 --> 25:26.458
I'm sorry, I'm...

25:26.460 --> 25:29.094
just on a bit
of a tight schedule.

25:30.531 --> 25:32.965
I understand.

25:32.967 --> 25:33.966
It's just that

25:33.968 --> 25:36.969
his mother
would like to meet you.

25:36.971 --> 25:38.237
I know, I know,

25:38.239 --> 25:42.074
I promise this won't take long,
but she's young.

25:42.076 --> 25:43.876
She's giving up everything,
Doctor.

25:43.878 --> 25:45.577
She'd just like to make sure
that her son

I'm David.

26:37.098 --> 26:38.430

26:42.269 --> 26:44.636

26:44.638 --> 26:45.637
Yes.

26:45.639 --> 26:48.640
Well, you know.

26:48.642 --> 26:52.611
You probably thought
I'd be younger.

26:52.613 --> 26:55.314
Don't worry, I'm...

26:55.316 --> 26:57.950
I'm just involved in the...

26:57.952 --> 27:00.486
I won't be his father.

27:00.488 --> 27:02.354
I-I won't be raising him.

27:04.458 --> 27:06.525
There's a couple in Texas.

27:07.495 --> 27:10.329
They're very excited.

27:10.331 --> 27:15.234
I didn't really have
a thought on the matter.

27:15.236 --> 27:18.570
Which is surprising
now that I think about it.

27:18.572 --> 27:22.474
Guess I was just focused
on the whole, you know,

27:22.476 --> 27:26.779
"being pregnant
and giving birth" thing.

27:29.417 --> 27:34.086
You're not from Boise,

About 30 miles away.

Born and raised.

It's a small town,
you probably never heard of it.

28:00.714 --> 28:03.182
Just a dot on a map.

28:03.184 --> 28:06.185
If you run,
they'll find you.

28:06.187 --> 28:10.422
I only know one small town
around here.

28:10.424 --> 28:12.458
Lindseyville?

28:12.460 --> 28:13.559
They have the outlet mall.

28:13.561 --> 28:15.294
Different one.

28:15.296 --> 28:16.695
Oh.

28:25.973 --> 28:27.539
No, it's fine.

28:30.744 --> 28:32.611
I've known him
since I was seven.

28:36.817 --> 28:41.286
But I-I didn't really...
know him.

28:42.490 --> 28:44.223
He hurt you.

28:46.260 --> 28:48.727
No.

28:48.729 --> 28:51.330
He tried to hurt me.

28:51.332 --> 28:53.065
Like my stepbrother.

28:53.067 --> 28:55.567
Like my father.

Well, don't dwell

29:14.488 --> 29:18.524
Let's not even
discuss it.

29:18.526 --> 29:20.092
The important
thing is that

29:20.094 --> 29:22.461
you're strong.

29:22.463 --> 29:24.496
I can tell you're smart.

29:24.498 --> 29:27.499
"Street smart" they call it.

29:27.501 --> 29:30.836
I don't know if I'm strong.

29:30.838 --> 29:33.505
I know how to survive.

29:33.507 --> 29:35.374
I'm not sure
that's the same thing.

29:35.376 --> 29:38.277
The strong do survive.

29:39.213 --> 29:42.381
But the meek
shall inherit the earth.

29:42.383 --> 29:47.319
Well, I-I think that's
still open to question.

29:47.321 --> 29:49.354
And now,

29:49.356 --> 29:50.522
about the money...

29:50.524 --> 29:52.457
We don't have to...
No, no, no, no, no.

Istanbul.

30:05.706 --> 30:07.206
The Grand Bazaar.

30:07.208 --> 30:11.843
Hearing the call to prayer
at the Blue Mosque.

30:11.845 --> 30:15.881
Or Bolivia, the salt flats.

30:15.883 --> 30:18.684
Raindrops pulled back
into the earth.

(exhales)

30:28.662 --> 30:29.661
I've been reading Proust.

30:29.663 --> 30:31.163
Do you know him?

30:31.165 --> 30:33.832
It's kind of totally boring,
there's like 12 books,

30:33.834 --> 30:35.500
and he has to describe
freaking everything,

30:35.502 --> 30:39.538
but when he gets it right...

30:39.540 --> 30:41.240
It was just the bite of a cookie

30:41.242 --> 30:42.908
that started it all.

30:42.910 --> 30:44.843
A madeleine.
Yes!

30:44.845 --> 30:48.513
I had to look up
what that one was.

30:48.515 --> 30:51.883
But then the memories.

30:51.885 --> 30:54.786
They overwhelm him.

30:54.788 --> 30:57.489

of a madeleine.

30:58.459 --> 31:00.926
Yes.
