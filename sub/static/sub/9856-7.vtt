00:53.378 --> 00:54.378
Andrej?

01:01.658 --> 01:02.698
Is anybody there?

01:17.738 --> 01:21.418
Andrej? Andrej! Andrej?

01:25.778 --> 01:28.378
- Oh, Andrej...
- Nora?

01:28.938 --> 01:31.778
Thank God you came.

01:32.058 --> 01:34.258
What have those monsters done to you?

01:43.978 --> 01:46.538
It pleased me greatly that I
would be spending my supper...

01:46.858 --> 01:49.538
discussing something other
than the Universality...

01:49.778 --> 01:52.298
and the Full Implementation
of the Rome Statute.

01:53.218 --> 01:55.018
I can't imagine why. It sounds gripping.

01:55.218 --> 01:57.178
You have that look in your eyes, Miles.

01:57.538 --> 02:00.698
You have something more down to
earth to talk about, don't you?

02:01.378 --> 02:03.418
Fact is, I need your help.

02:04.258 --> 02:07.578
About three years ago, a
priest walks into Scotland Yard,

02:08.657 --> 02:10.898
says he thinks one of his
parishioners had been murdered.

02:11.618 --> 02:14.818
Now, this elderly gent, excellent health,

02:15.538 --> 02:18.218
full possession of all his
faculties and so forth, meets a girl,

02:18.418 --> 02:20.098
they get on. He breaks his leg.

02:20.698 --> 02:22.818
She takes up residence to aid his recovery.

02:23.738 --> 02:25.858
He sickens, and dies.

02:26.538 --> 02:29.538
And then the girl
just... up and disappears.

02:30.618 --> 02:32.418
- Evidence of foul play?
- No.

02:32.858 --> 02:34.834
That's when the priest finds
out that they were married,

02:34.858 --> 02:35.898
not even a proper wedding,

02:36.138 --> 02:38.338
just some scribble in a
book at some registry office.

02:38.498 --> 02:39.818
And the priest is suspicious,

02:40.658 --> 02:44.218
especially because the deceased was
a religious man and a wealthy one.

02:44.738 --> 02:48.778
Well, gold-digging is the
world's second-oldest profession,

02:49.298 --> 02:51.098
and there is no law against it.

02:52.218 --> 02:54.778
But last year the same thing happens again.

02:55.658 --> 02:59.498
A rich old cove meets a girl, an accident,

02:59.658 --> 03:01.618
and his maker in quick succession.

03:02.058 --> 03:05.498
Except this time, the victim,
or rather alleged victim,

03:05.818 --> 03:07.258
is a retired M.P.

03:07.498 --> 03:10.018
Straight away I pop 'round
to interview the widow,

03:10.218 --> 03:13.578
but now it's the extended family
that are blocking my progress.

03:13.978 --> 03:18.058
But you know me, I'm not one
to shy away from a challenge.

03:18.418 --> 03:20.578
No one ever accused you
of being shy, Miles...

03:20.898 --> 03:25.298
But you know as well as I do that
we do not take a case unless...

03:25.498 --> 03:26.498
Unless...

03:27.018 --> 03:29.258
I'm sitting, having my
toast this morning and...

03:29.498 --> 03:31.178
a human interest story comes on the telly.

03:31.538 --> 03:34.258
A woman in the Czech Republic
has gone to the press...

03:34.578 --> 03:37.018
saying that her beloved
landlord has been murdered,

03:37.578 --> 03:41.938
and it's the same story, a rich
old corpse, hungry young bride.

03:42.298 --> 03:43.978
Identical circumstances?

03:44.458 --> 03:47.098
Pretty damning. And it's a fresh case.

03:47.778 --> 03:49.898
The widow is still in
residence. So if we move fast...

03:50.098 --> 03:52.258
- You mean, if my team moves fast.
- Exactly.

03:53.098 --> 03:57.938
I can't justify ignoring the
pattern in these cases any longer.

03:58.178 --> 03:59.778
Who knows how many men have been killed?

04:00.418 --> 04:01.738
Or who could be next.

04:14.738 --> 04:16.577
How much longer, my angel?

04:20.538 --> 04:21.858
Not long now, darling.

04:56.138 --> 05:01.778
Andrej Havran was a good man who
fell victim to a heartless fraud,

05:02.938 --> 05:05.498
a person who led him to believe...

05:05.978 --> 05:08.818
that she cared for him
more than his wealth.

05:09.898 --> 05:11.338
Now Andrej is dead.

05:12.378 --> 05:15.938
That has all the hallmarks
of these two deaths...

05:16.138 --> 05:18.258
that Miles has been
investigating in London.

05:18.938 --> 05:22.098
Yermak Trigorin, 92-year-old
former Russian Cossack.

05:22.418 --> 05:26.058
Emigrated to London in 1958.
Made his fortune in manufacturing.

05:26.578 --> 05:28.538
Regular churchgoer, no immediate family.

05:29.058 --> 05:31.818
When he had the misfortune to
meet Josie Miller in 2011...

05:32.018 --> 05:33.538
he was a relatively healthy man.

05:34.218 --> 05:36.698
She moved in, nine
months later, he was dead.

05:37.018 --> 05:39.018
Next, Jerome McEwan.

05:39.338 --> 05:43.298
A widower and retired Member
of Parliament for Enfield North.

05:44.818 --> 05:47.298
He met Brittany Campion, 2012.

05:48.138 --> 05:50.098
Dead before their first anniversary.

05:50.338 --> 05:52.818
The widow disappeared before
I was able to question her.

05:53.258 --> 05:54.818
And now, this new case in Prague.

05:55.258 --> 05:56.418
Same in every detail,

05:56.898 --> 05:58.538
down to the debilitating accident...

05:58.938 --> 06:03.138
not long after the flame of
love was kindled, as it were.

06:03.418 --> 06:04.418
And in each instance,

06:05.258 --> 06:06.818
the young woman...

06:07.418 --> 06:11.618
insisted that she be the one to
nurse the invalid back to health.

06:12.018 --> 06:13.338
They did a shite job of it.

06:13.538 --> 06:17.338
And between injury and death
is when the marriages happened?

06:17.898 --> 06:19.298
Could it be a coincidence?

06:19.538 --> 06:21.818
I have two enemies,
criminals and coincidences.

06:22.058 --> 06:24.578
- And Travellers.
- I already mentioned criminals.

06:25.178 --> 06:28.178
So this Nora Skalova, she's
a... she's a real game changer,

06:28.778 --> 06:30.938
publicly taking on this black widow.

06:32.338 --> 06:33.698
Black widow?

06:34.218 --> 06:38.538
Black widow spiders, the females
mate, and then eat their husbands.

06:38.898 --> 06:40.098
How are they doing it?

06:40.378 --> 06:43.218
The same as spiders do, I suspect. Poison.

06:43.458 --> 06:45.978
If this is epidemic, how
has nobody noticed it yet?

06:46.498 --> 06:48.858
Well, poison can be the most
difficult thing to prove...

06:49.058 --> 06:50.258
if you're not looking for it.

06:50.778 --> 06:53.538
The effects can mirror
natural deterioration.

06:53.818 --> 06:57.418
Exactly, if a specific
toxicology test isn't ordered,

06:57.818 --> 07:00.378
cause of death can be easily misdiagnosed.

07:01.218 --> 07:03.538
Tommy, Arabela, go to Prague,

07:03.938 --> 07:07.458
find out about this recently deceased man.

07:08.418 --> 07:11.098
How about Eva and I go to London
and check out those cold cases?

07:11.458 --> 07:14.698
Might not find anything.
Sometimes old men just die.

07:16.818 --> 07:20.738
Old men always die, but sometimes
they're hastened into their grave.

07:29.098 --> 07:32.538
I mean, come on, do you really
think they've got anything in common?

07:33.858 --> 07:34.858
I don't know.

07:35.658 --> 07:38.138
My grandparents had 30 years between them,

07:38.338 --> 07:39.978
and they were together their whole lives.

07:41.578 --> 07:42.578
Ageist.

07:43.098 --> 07:46.258
No, look, I mean, I get it
from a man's perspective.

07:46.498 --> 07:48.178
He's got a hot young bird, nurse's outfit,

07:48.338 --> 07:50.738
pushing him around in his
wheelchair. Of course he's in love.

07:51.498 --> 07:52.578
But what about the girl?

07:53.138 --> 07:56.098
Her friends are all at nightclubs and
she's changing her husband's nappies?

07:56.138 --> 07:58.618
Some women are comforted
by having a father figure.

07:59.178 --> 08:02.138
Not every woman wants an
unreliable lad your age.

08:02.338 --> 08:04.018
Aye, and the money doesn't hurt, either.

08:04.218 --> 08:07.218
Along with wisdom and maturity,
yes, often come wealth.

08:08.578 --> 08:11.218
But if it helps smooth
out the wrinkles, so what?

08:12.618 --> 08:14.258
I could fall in love with an older man.

08:15.658 --> 08:17.418
Could fall or have fallen?

08:17.778 --> 08:20.338
You got a secret little sugar
daddy there somewhere, Seeger,

08:20.538 --> 08:21.658
you're not telling us about?

08:25.898 --> 08:27.978
Says here that the men
died of natural causes.

08:28.498 --> 08:31.458
Cardiopulmonary arrest,
acute gastroenteritis...

08:32.418 --> 08:33.778
And no autopsy performed.

08:33.977 --> 08:36.538
"Just what part of "Get it done"
do you not understand, Charles?"

08:36.658 --> 08:37.977
Did you order an exhumation?

08:40.138 --> 08:43.658
The family of the Right
Honourable M.P. McEwan forbade it.

08:45.018 --> 08:50.138
As for the Trigorin, the Ministry
insists on more than just my hunch.

08:51.578 --> 08:55.218
Well, if we need proof of poison,
the corpse is the best place to look.

08:55.418 --> 08:57.354
No, no doubt, but I still
think there's still a chance...

08:57.378 --> 08:59.098
that we could find
something at their homes.

08:59.574 --> 09:03.534
No. The Trigorin house was sold
almost immediately after his death.

09:04.174 --> 09:06.414
The McEwan estate is still held in probate.

09:06.694 --> 09:10.014
The extended family tried to
challenge the will and failed.

09:10.214 --> 09:12.294
Then, the grieving widow, Brittany,

09:13.014 --> 09:15.814
signed over the property
to a git called Tas,

09:16.334 --> 09:17.854
claiming to be her cousin.

09:20.494 --> 09:21.494
Think he's the pimp?

09:22.054 --> 09:23.254
He certainly looks like one.

09:23.974 --> 09:25.454
Let's go visit this Tas.

09:28.734 --> 09:30.894
I have copies of banking
and investment records.

09:31.894 --> 09:34.254
These are from before the
victims met their new brides,

09:34.654 --> 09:35.734
and these are after.

09:36.094 --> 09:37.974
I've highlighted the
transactions of interest.

09:38.414 --> 09:39.974
Note the high increase of withdrawals,

09:40.174 --> 09:42.134
5,000 pounds here. 10,000 pounds there.

09:42.614 --> 09:44.694
After the women enter their lives.

09:45.654 --> 09:48.774
An identical pattern to Mr. Havran's
statements from Czech National Bank.

09:49.294 --> 09:50.974
Unfortunately, it is not probative.

09:51.854 --> 09:56.894
You might be able to prove fraud,
probably elder abuse, but not murder.

09:57.414 --> 09:59.254
They were bleeding these men dry.

10:00.134 --> 10:02.054
Any attorney worth their salt...

10:02.734 --> 10:05.494
will be able to get them off
with the most minor of penalties.

10:06.014 --> 10:08.775
Well, if they steal enough money
maybe they can run for public office.

10:11.654 --> 10:14.654
We need solid evidence or this
investigation will not proceed.

10:15.174 --> 10:16.294
Keep searching.

10:32.814 --> 10:34.094
Detectives McConnell and Seeger.

10:34.294 --> 10:36.334
We called ahead to see
the body of Andrej Havran.

10:40.094 --> 10:43.974
I'm sorry, those remains are
being cremated at this very minute.

10:44.494 --> 10:46.134
Well, call them to stop it right now.

10:46.334 --> 10:47.334
Where's the furnace room?

11:08.254 --> 11:09.854
I spoke with the widow myself.

11:10.294 --> 11:12.854
She specifically
requested we rush the work.

11:13.053 --> 11:15.293
- And you didn't find that odd?
- It's not unusual.

11:15.995 --> 11:18.073
She wanted the remains
for a memorial service.

11:18.322 --> 11:20.787
We made an official police request.

11:21.503 --> 11:23.448
And there was an unfortunate mix-up.

11:23.738 --> 11:25.538
You have just cost us
very important evidence.

11:31.994 --> 11:33.714
Well, she certainly doesn't waste any time.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.114
Rushed to cremation, no autopsy?

11:37.394 --> 11:38.914
A fine way to get rid of your victims.

11:39.794 --> 11:42.034
We need to speak to the last
person who saw him alive.

12:09.044 --> 12:11.644
Nice car. Business must be good.

12:12.204 --> 12:13.684
I see you upgraded your own ride.

12:14.284 --> 12:16.204
Is that supposed to be
funny? Is he a funny guy?

12:16.404 --> 12:18.244
You said he was stupid, not suicidal.

12:18.564 --> 12:20.484
I'm gonna sue your
whole lot for harassment.

12:20.724 --> 12:25.324
I noticed an outstanding warrant for
Suspicion of Handling Stolen Goods.

12:25.564 --> 12:28.244
December 11th, last year.
We're here to search the house.

12:28.604 --> 12:30.124
Bollocks. That's no grounds.

12:30.604 --> 12:33.364
You're Anastas Cooper,
right? And this is your house?

12:36.324 --> 12:38.204
Then according to this
here search warrant...

12:40.204 --> 12:41.204
it is grounds.

12:46.284 --> 12:47.284
Am I under arrest?

12:47.724 --> 12:49.484
No. You're free to go.

12:56.324 --> 12:57.324
Wanker.

13:01.644 --> 13:05.204
Andrej Havran. Age 93. Admitted
on the 20th of last month.

13:05.924 --> 13:08.604
Oh, renal failure, heart
arrhythmia, loss of appetite.

13:08.844 --> 13:10.684
We kept him hydrated, made him comfortable.

13:10.884 --> 13:12.220
He died four days later in his sleep.

13:12.244 --> 13:13.284
Why no autopsy?

13:13.724 --> 13:15.924
Nothing indicated a post-mortem
exam would be necessary.

13:16.404 --> 13:18.564
Would it have been necessary
if it was your own father?

13:19.524 --> 13:21.884
Detective, I don't care for your tone,

13:22.284 --> 13:24.204
and I owe you no
explanation of my decisions.

13:24.644 --> 13:26.260
We gave Mr. Havran the
best possible care here.

13:26.284 --> 13:27.044
The symptoms...

13:27.244 --> 13:30.084
The symptoms were those of a very
old man letting go of his life.

13:41.364 --> 13:42.364
Quite a haul.

13:43.884 --> 13:46.484
God, I wish people could have
more respect for the elderly.

13:48.284 --> 13:50.004
If you want respect, you gotta die young.

13:51.084 --> 13:53.564
You never hear about the
tragic death of an old person.

13:54.964 --> 13:56.324
My father died young.

13:57.084 --> 13:59.404
There were so many old
people at his funeral.

14:00.284 --> 14:02.004
We were part of a big family.

14:02.804 --> 14:05.244
I used to spend time when I was back home.

14:06.084 --> 14:07.804
Believe it or not, I used to cook for them.

14:09.204 --> 14:10.924
I remember listening to their stories.

14:11.404 --> 14:12.724
I learned so much from them.

14:13.844 --> 14:15.524
I'm sure they learned a lot from you, too.

14:15.604 --> 14:18.204
Yeah... this is disgraceful.

14:18.404 --> 14:21.724
These are men who fought wars,
who served their countries.

14:21.924 --> 14:24.084
They're just used up and
thrown away like nothing.

14:24.364 --> 14:25.924
Reduced to a few possessions.

14:27.084 --> 14:30.564
You know, I've got to tell you, Tas
hasn't left much for us to work with.

14:32.324 --> 14:34.164
Well, if we are going to find anything,

14:34.364 --> 14:35.804
it's going to be wherever he sleeps.

14:38.044 --> 14:39.044
Yeah.

14:41.724 --> 14:44.084
I'd hate to see what the
ScanGen could pick up in here.

14:44.284 --> 14:45.604
Jesus Christ.

14:54.244 --> 14:55.364
Look at that.

15:02.124 --> 15:03.644
They look like more than just cousins.

15:06.164 --> 15:09.484
That might be helpful,
Brittney's long blonde hair.

15:09.684 --> 15:12.164
Until we can get her in person,
her hair will have to do.

15:12.524 --> 15:13.604
Yeah.

15:14.444 --> 15:17.044
Let's look for tickets, receipts,
anything that can get us to...

15:27.764 --> 15:29.044
Where do you think you're going?

15:31.822 --> 15:32.822
This yours?

15:33.342 --> 15:34.502
What were you doing in there?

15:34.542 --> 15:35.942
Look, my great uncle is in trouble.

15:37.102 --> 15:41.182
- He married his bitch of a nurse...
- Stop, whoa, whoa. Who's your uncle?

15:41.942 --> 15:43.142
Herbert Baxendale.

15:44.722 --> 15:45.982
Do we have a live one?

15:49.417 --> 15:50.417
Of course I disapproved.

15:51.097 --> 15:53.177
This little tart, Sabina,
gets a ring on his finger,

15:53.577 --> 15:56.017
changes his will, starts
emptying out his bank accounts...

15:56.217 --> 15:57.217
Lawrence!

15:57.897 --> 15:59.737
I followed Sabina to
that house more than once.

16:00.617 --> 16:03.817
She's shagging that yellow-haired
Neanderthal, I'm sure of it.

16:05.057 --> 16:08.297
Are you sure you follow her
around just for your uncle's sake?

16:08.737 --> 16:11.937
Or do you just like
to... follow her around.

16:13.337 --> 16:14.337
What are you implying?

16:14.457 --> 16:16.137
We're cops, we don't imply.

16:16.937 --> 16:19.177
- Did you catch them?
- Catch them what?

16:19.457 --> 16:21.177
In flagrante.

16:22.097 --> 16:25.697
No. Well, not exactly. But
that's why I was there today.

16:26.177 --> 16:28.577
- So you could watch them have sex.
- Look, I...

16:28.977 --> 16:30.137
I just need something...

16:30.337 --> 16:32.697
to prove to Uncle Edward that
she's not who she says she is.

16:34.137 --> 16:35.417
I think he's going senile.

16:35.697 --> 16:37.457
He already has advanced
renal failure, and...

16:37.657 --> 16:39.697
- Are you a doctor?
- No, I'm a financial analyst.

16:40.137 --> 16:41.977
But I know he needs dialysis twice weekly.

16:42.297 --> 16:44.657
I know these drugs she's giving him are...

16:45.097 --> 16:46.817
putting his only kidney under extra strain.

16:48.337 --> 16:51.137
I... I'm worried for him.

16:51.337 --> 16:52.337
Lawrence...

16:53.017 --> 16:55.177
are you aware of what happened
to the previous owner...

16:55.337 --> 16:56.497
of the house you broke into?

16:59.777 --> 17:01.137
Okay, bye for now, mate.

17:03.289 --> 17:05.969
That was Hickman. Their cold
case in London just got hot.

17:06.289 --> 17:09.329
- Another victim?
- Victim in progress. And a suspect.

17:09.929 --> 17:10.929
The plot thickens.

17:11.729 --> 17:13.809
So this is the building Mr. Havran owned?

17:14.009 --> 17:17.809
Neo-Renaissance. Very
nice. Shame for the view.

17:18.729 --> 17:20.169
I can see why he made a good mark.

17:21.089 --> 17:22.569
Right, his flat was on the top floor,

17:22.648 --> 17:24.625
and the neighbour, Nora
Skalova, was on the second.

17:24.648 --> 17:25.648
Shall we?

17:29.409 --> 17:30.969
I am sorry about the temperature.

17:31.289 --> 17:35.169
My new landlady has shut
off my heat. Her latest ploy.

17:35.489 --> 17:36.729
To get you out of the building?

17:36.969 --> 17:38.729
Payback for my press conference.

17:39.329 --> 17:40.849
And that boyfriend of hers!

17:41.449 --> 17:42.889
Jude he calls himself.

17:43.089 --> 17:46.569
Dumps rubbish in front of my door
and harasses me in the hallways.

17:46.769 --> 17:49.849
- Has he gotten physical with you?
- Worse. Legal.

17:50.049 --> 17:51.729
She claims I tried to attack her.

17:51.929 --> 17:53.729
Yes, we're very aware of that.

17:54.129 --> 17:57.009
Emily Havran has filed a
restraining order against you.

17:57.689 --> 17:59.769
Sounds like they're looking
for grounds for eviction.

18:00.689 --> 18:02.809
I've lived here for 18 years,

18:03.689 --> 18:05.089
and since she moved in,

18:05.529 --> 18:08.809
they have scared most the
tenants and doubled the rents.

18:09.249 --> 18:12.489
When did you first notice a
change in Mr. Havran's health?

18:13.009 --> 18:14.369
Almost immediately.

18:14.969 --> 18:17.569
He was in magnificent
condition for a man his age.

18:17.969 --> 18:20.729
We used to ice-skate
together. Can you imagine?

18:21.129 --> 18:23.449
A 90-year-old man on ice skates?

18:24.489 --> 18:28.049
But then he deteriorated, rapidly.

18:28.529 --> 18:30.969
The other day, I could
see all his windows open,

18:31.169 --> 18:35.689
and it was bitter cold. So
I let myself into his flat.

18:36.409 --> 18:38.849
Now that could be interpreted
as breaking and entering.

18:39.209 --> 18:40.209
It was unlocked.

18:41.209 --> 18:43.609
And anyway, he gave me a key years ago.

18:44.809 --> 18:46.609
The state of the place was...

18:47.409 --> 18:50.409
It was a mess. It stank of vomit.

18:50.769 --> 18:52.209
Emily was rarely there.

18:52.489 --> 18:56.369
She was probably living the
high life at some ritzy hotel...

18:58.009 --> 19:01.969
while poor Andrej wasted away up there,

19:03.289 --> 19:05.049
lying in his own filth.

19:05.689 --> 19:07.409
And that's when you called the authorities?

19:07.689 --> 19:10.449
Yes, but she was now his wife.

19:10.649 --> 19:12.529
I had no right to interfere.

19:13.489 --> 19:16.969
You know, she wouldn't even let me
visit when he went into the hospital?

19:23.129 --> 19:26.169
Have you left all this
rubbish in the hallway again?

19:26.969 --> 19:29.889
I'm sick and tired of
your disgusting habits.

19:30.089 --> 19:31.689
his is a respectable residence.

19:31.889 --> 19:34.249
- Calm down, ma'am.
- Don't come near me.

19:35.049 --> 19:36.569
I have a good mind to call the police.

19:36.769 --> 19:37.889
We are the police.

19:44.409 --> 19:47.809
I want you gone by tomorrow.

20:02.849 --> 20:04.489
I'd call this a fire hazard.

20:09.169 --> 20:10.729
501. There.

20:14.209 --> 20:16.129
Police. We know you're home.

20:20.289 --> 20:21.289
You.

20:22.169 --> 20:23.209
May we come in?

20:23.609 --> 20:25.489
No. You may not.

20:25.889 --> 20:27.449
Whatever you're selling, we don't want.

20:27.529 --> 20:29.049
Just want to talk to the missus, mate.

20:29.689 --> 20:31.569
- About what?
- Littering.

20:33.489 --> 20:35.529
Either arrest her or go away.

20:36.129 --> 20:40.369
Actually, I think we have
everything we need. Detective.

20:42.249 --> 20:43.289
See you later, ma'am.

20:47.889 --> 20:49.249
Did you get a whiff of that place?

20:49.569 --> 20:51.169
Lemon oil and fresh air.

20:52.049 --> 20:54.529
Nora told us it was a complete mess.

20:55.009 --> 20:58.609
There's been a proper cleaning.
Wonder when bin day is.

21:02.769 --> 21:05.249
You can learn a lot about
people by what's in their trash.

21:06.609 --> 21:09.769
Ugh... including some
things you'd rather not know.

21:10.729 --> 21:13.089
Here we go. Andrej Havran.

21:21.049 --> 21:22.609
Eastern Orthodox prayer beads.

21:23.209 --> 21:25.209
I guess they didn't think
they were worth anything.

21:30.329 --> 21:31.329
Human remains?

21:34.169 --> 21:35.609
If these teeth could talk...

21:37.249 --> 21:38.249
Maybe they can.

22:04.179 --> 22:07.219
Sabina, I've brought some people
to speak with Uncle Edward.

22:16.739 --> 22:20.899
So, Lawrence, you've
contacted the police, have you?

22:23.339 --> 22:25.819
Actually, we contacted him.

22:26.859 --> 22:28.059
We're sorry to intrude.

22:28.459 --> 22:29.739
We'd like to know if we could...

22:30.059 --> 22:31.299
speak to you for a moment, sir.

22:31.499 --> 22:34.179
- I was just about to prepare tea.
- May I join you?

22:34.659 --> 22:35.659
Of course.

22:38.099 --> 22:40.219
- Mr. Baxendale...
- Edward, please.

22:40.859 --> 22:44.139
Edward. I'm Detective
Carl Hickman from the ICC,

22:44.339 --> 22:45.659
the International Criminal Court.

22:48.019 --> 22:51.459
We have reason to believe
that your wife may be...

22:51.659 --> 22:55.059
I know! I know. I am sick of
all you Calvinists telling me...

22:55.259 --> 22:58.779
I can't buy a young woman's love. Hmm?

22:58.979 --> 22:59.979
Why can't I?

23:00.379 --> 23:02.059
Lawrence put you up to this, didn't he?

23:02.419 --> 23:04.859
He's afflicted with envy and greed.

23:05.699 --> 23:06.939
I don't have to listen to this.

23:10.139 --> 23:12.459
He's always been a petulant boy!

23:13.219 --> 23:14.979
Now, are you going to lecture me?

23:15.179 --> 23:16.939
Because if you are,
you can get out as well.

23:17.419 --> 23:22.299
I don't... I don't care if you
marry the Archbishop of Canterbury.

23:23.219 --> 23:24.219
To each his own.

23:24.379 --> 23:28.859
But if somebody is trying
to kill you, I care a lot.

23:32.395 --> 23:33.395
Kill me?

23:36.077 --> 23:37.077
You see...

23:44.906 --> 23:46.268
That's the Taverner Problem?

23:47.786 --> 23:53.326
Black's got, what, 19 possible moves,
but all of them result in checkmate.

23:53.966 --> 23:56.286
White to move, mate in two.

23:57.546 --> 23:58.586
Now, tell me,

23:59.746 --> 24:01.466
what is this about me getting killed?

24:02.426 --> 24:04.546
He's quite a spirited man, your husband.

24:06.266 --> 24:07.986
He reminds me a little bit of my father.

24:09.186 --> 24:10.506
Your father must be a lovely man.

24:12.426 --> 24:13.426
He was.

24:15.586 --> 24:16.906
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:18.466 --> 24:20.826
I'm doing my best to keep Teddy
with me as long as possible.

24:21.346 --> 24:24.866
It must be really hard for you
to look after him all by yourself.

24:33.786 --> 24:35.786
Do you keep track of all
this medicine on your own?

24:38.386 --> 24:39.386
I do.

24:44.439 --> 24:47.479
Do you go out much? I mean,
do you have time for yourself?

24:49.759 --> 24:53.599
Not much, but I don't mind. I'm a homebody.

24:56.399 --> 24:57.639
Are you happy?

25:00.559 --> 25:01.559
Poisoning me?

25:02.039 --> 25:04.199
It's a possibility we are
currently looking into.

25:04.839 --> 25:07.799
Edward, your welfare is our direct concern.

25:08.199 --> 25:10.399
You know, Detective, I don't
mind if she does poison me.

25:11.039 --> 25:12.039
Come again?

25:12.119 --> 25:13.919
You see that picture on
the mantle over there?

25:14.199 --> 25:17.399
That's me and my dear
departed Jane at our cottage.

25:18.479 --> 25:22.999
She treated me like a king. It was bliss.

25:23.919 --> 25:28.079
I tell you, I never thought
I'd meet anyone so lovely again.

25:28.279 --> 25:31.559
Until I met Sabina, that is.

25:32.959 --> 25:34.439
When you're married to an angel,

25:35.479 --> 25:37.079
you're always ready for heaven.

25:40.479 --> 25:42.519
Was your angel with you
when you broke your hip?

25:42.759 --> 25:44.695
It wasn't her, if that's what
you're saying. She was miles away.

25:44.719 --> 25:46.895
It was some bloke on a motorbike
who ran me down in front of...

25:46.919 --> 25:48.959
a tobacconist's. Hair like a girl's.

25:49.679 --> 25:52.759
We have reason to believe that
there are male accomplices...

25:53.159 --> 25:54.879
involved as well. Look,

25:55.159 --> 25:58.279
I really don't care what you do
with your money or your love life.

25:58.519 --> 26:00.599
If you want to, and we would like you to,

26:01.079 --> 26:03.799
clear away any doubt about Sabina,

26:04.599 --> 26:06.999
come down to Scotland Yard,
give us a blood sample.

26:07.359 --> 26:09.399
If it's clean, she's clear.

26:10.399 --> 26:11.439
Absolutely not.

26:12.839 --> 26:17.559
Several men in your exact
situation have already died.

26:18.359 --> 26:22.679
If Sabina does want to do away
with me, at least I'll die smiling.

26:29.959 --> 26:31.479
What was that big exit all about?

26:32.999 --> 26:36.239
If there's one thing our family
excels at, it's guilt trips.

26:39.159 --> 26:42.199
In 2008, I finally convinced Edward
to let me invest some of the money...

26:42.399 --> 26:44.559
he was stuffing the mattress with.

26:46.559 --> 26:48.239
Six weeks later, the market crashed.

26:50.319 --> 26:51.319
How much did you lose?

26:52.239 --> 26:53.279
Oh, plenty.

26:54.679 --> 26:57.199
Not as much as he's lost on
that slag, mind you, but...

26:58.639 --> 27:00.159
but he'll never let me forget it.

27:06.239 --> 27:08.599
- Any news on our widows?
- Yeah.

27:08.799 --> 27:10.239
This just came in from the lab, sir.

27:10.999 --> 27:13.159
DNA on Brittany McEwan's
hairbrush in London...

27:13.359 --> 27:17.239
is a match to the saliva on Emily
Havran's cigarette in Prague.

27:19.319 --> 27:20.439
The same DNA?

27:20.879 --> 27:21.959
And that got me thinking...

27:23.839 --> 27:24.839
Have a look.

27:25.239 --> 27:28.199
This is Brittany McEwan.
Blonde hair, brown eyes,

27:28.559 --> 27:29.919
tan, slim build.

27:30.399 --> 27:33.119
This is Emily, red hair, blue eyes,

27:33.319 --> 27:37.479
fair skinned, smaller nose,
much larger... blouse size.

27:38.639 --> 27:40.559
They are the same person. Or twins.

27:40.799 --> 27:43.039
Well, if I were a betting man...

27:43.919 --> 27:44.959
which of course I'm not...

27:46.439 --> 27:49.559
I'd say same person.
Plastic surgery, dye job.

27:49.759 --> 27:51.919
Tanning bed. Colored contact lenses.

27:53.119 --> 27:54.679
We just got off the phone with the lab.

27:54.879 --> 27:56.839
The dental bridge found
in Emily Havran's trash...

27:56.879 --> 27:58.839
is confirmed to be that of Andrej Havran.

27:59.319 --> 28:00.599
And the toxicology screening?

28:01.199 --> 28:04.639
A piece of food in the teeth
came back positive for Digitalis.

28:05.399 --> 28:09.279
Yes, it's derived from the leaves
and seeds of the foxglove plant.

28:09.839 --> 28:11.159
It's a cardiac stimulant,

28:11.479 --> 28:13.439
used in the treatment of
congestive heart disease.

28:13.639 --> 28:14.639
Fatal in quantity.

28:14.679 --> 28:17.199
But Havran was not taking that drug.

28:17.519 --> 28:18.759
Neither were the other victims.

28:18.879 --> 28:20.135
All right, let me get this straight,

28:20.159 --> 28:21.719
Emily and Brittany are the same person.

28:22.119 --> 28:25.799
Emily was poisoning Mr. Havran,
and Sabina was visiting Brittany.

28:26.119 --> 28:28.319
Which is why Lawrence thought
she was having an affair.

28:28.879 --> 28:29.879
They are all connected.

28:30.599 --> 28:33.479
Yes! Right, let's go
order those exhumations.

28:33.719 --> 28:34.999
And let's bring in our suspects.

28:43.199 --> 28:44.199
They bugged out.

29:13.279 --> 29:15.399
- You guys, upstairs.
- Yes, sir.

29:17.879 --> 29:18.879
Oh, my god...

29:30.359 --> 29:31.559
There's nobody here, sir!

29:32.359 --> 29:34.279
- They got him.
- You see this?

29:36.679 --> 29:37.999
- What?
- Foxglove.

29:39.162 --> 29:40.442
Poison in plain sight.

29:48.562 --> 29:49.682
Thank you for coming, Louis.

29:49.802 --> 29:51.122
We need all the help we can get.

29:51.842 --> 29:53.962
I put out an All-Ports
Warning for Edward Baxendale...

29:54.082 --> 29:55.162
and the four suspects.

29:56.442 --> 29:58.522
These women could have new aliases by now.

29:58.842 --> 30:01.322
Stolen identities. False passports.

30:02.562 --> 30:06.722
Well, if they're all so suspicious,
why not just kill Edward now?

30:07.202 --> 30:09.802
I mean, he can only slow them
down. I don't really get it.

30:10.282 --> 30:12.322
Unless they plan to hold him for ransom.

30:12.842 --> 30:13.842
Hey!

30:14.482 --> 30:16.802
I thought you were some sort
of elite crime fighting force.

30:16.962 --> 30:19.842
And you lose a stupid girl
and a diabetic old man?

30:20.162 --> 30:23.282
If he doesn't get his dialysis soon,
he'll die, and it will be your fault.

30:23.482 --> 30:24.482
Are you happy with that?

30:25.562 --> 30:27.522
- What's this?
- Oh, I think you know, Larry.

30:28.642 --> 30:31.242
Detective Berger here can find
anything if there's a record of it.

30:31.322 --> 30:35.762
Yet he can't seem to find where
you invested 200,000 pounds...

30:36.002 --> 30:38.322
of your uncle's savings? Huh? Ring a bell?

30:38.682 --> 30:40.282
- That doesn't mean that I...
- Bullshit.

30:40.722 --> 30:43.562
You'd been shorting your own stocks
for months before the market tanked.

30:43.802 --> 30:46.362
- Guess you saw it coming, huh?
- You're a pusillanimous prig.

30:46.842 --> 30:48.162
Stealing from your own family?

30:48.402 --> 30:50.562
You're nothing more than
a petty scam merchant.

30:52.202 --> 30:53.682
You'll be hearing from my solicitors.

30:57.722 --> 30:59.042
Do people really say that?

30:59.402 --> 31:00.482
Assholes do.

31:00.882 --> 31:01.882
I've got something.

31:06.282 --> 31:07.282
Pusillanimous?

31:11.212 --> 31:13.572
I've been tracking the
Baxendale's bank and credit cards.

31:13.972 --> 31:16.292
There was a cash machine
withdrawal at a bank near Bristol.

31:16.492 --> 31:18.252
This was recorded a few hours ago.

31:18.692 --> 31:21.092
Just Sabina? None of her co-conspirators?

31:21.732 --> 31:22.452
No.

31:22.652 --> 31:24.452
No sign of Edward Baxendale, either.

31:24.692 --> 31:25.852
But why take him to Bristol?

31:27.012 --> 31:28.012
Wait a minute.

31:31.292 --> 31:33.132
Edward said he had a vacation house.

31:33.532 --> 31:36.252
Was there any mention of this in
his records, tax returns, anything?

31:36.852 --> 31:38.612
I haven't seen anything
about a second home.

31:38.852 --> 31:40.812
Well, maybe it belonged
to his late wife's family?

31:47.492 --> 31:50.212
- Devon.
- Miles, what do you think?

31:52.150 --> 31:53.950
Judging by their clothes,
they're off hunting.

31:54.631 --> 31:56.791
Well, there's loads of
shooting estates down there.

31:59.591 --> 32:01.111
Not the best quality image,

32:01.631 --> 32:03.871
but by extrapolating the natural contours,

32:04.551 --> 32:07.351
and comparing to a topographical
map of shooting estates in that area,

32:07.591 --> 32:10.071
I might be able to pinpoint the location.

32:10.831 --> 32:13.631
- How far by helicopter?
- About an hour.

32:25.031 --> 32:26.741
Carl.

32:54.871 --> 32:57.871
Look at that artifact in
the corner. Must be a glitch.

32:58.231 --> 32:59.991
It's in the original photo, too, you see?

33:03.302 --> 33:04.302
Wait a minute.

33:05.542 --> 33:09.622
Hound Tor is an ancient granite
outcrop. 414 metres tall.

33:09.862 --> 33:11.782
Well, that's why it's
visible from the cottage.

33:12.222 --> 33:13.662
And a known quantity.

33:13.942 --> 33:16.342
So if we use that as scale
for distance from the house...

33:17.902 --> 33:20.078
the cottage is four degrees
north and five kilometers...

33:20.102 --> 33:21.862
distant from the Hound Tor landmark.

33:25.262 --> 33:26.902
Moretonhampstead, Devon.

33:27.222 --> 33:30.142
Coordinates 50.39.37 north,

33:30.542 --> 33:33.182
03.46.02 west.

33:34.102 --> 33:35.102
Roger that.

33:37.982 --> 33:41.222
What a happy couple. No kids?

33:42.062 --> 33:43.062
Nope.

33:43.462 --> 33:46.022
The world could definitely use
more good people raising children.

33:50.222 --> 33:51.662
I know we never talked about this...

33:53.942 --> 33:56.462
But I really think you're gonna
be an amazing father, Sebastien.

33:58.862 --> 34:01.822
I can't help but worry I'm
going to screw him up somehow.

34:02.782 --> 34:05.742
Well, I guess that's normal,
but you are a good man,

34:06.662 --> 34:10.062
yes, with a big heart, and
you're honest... yes, you are.

34:11.062 --> 34:12.262
You're going to do fine.

34:14.382 --> 34:15.542
My father was a...

34:16.742 --> 34:21.181
a crook, and a liar, and I
turned out quite well anyway.

34:23.462 --> 34:24.542
I think I did.

34:25.262 --> 34:26.302
Well...

34:36.342 --> 34:37.342
There!

34:40.942 --> 34:42.062
Go down, now.

35:16.151 --> 35:17.831
Checkmate.

35:24.151 --> 35:25.151
All clear.

35:27.151 --> 35:28.311
So what is this, Sabina?

35:28.551 --> 35:32.231
Is this some kind of Sisterhood
of the Black Widows? What?

35:33.031 --> 35:36.351
Your wife is part of a
murder-for-profit gang...

35:36.551 --> 35:37.991
that's poisoned three men.

35:38.431 --> 35:40.791
- God knows how many more.
- That makes them serial killers.

35:41.431 --> 35:42.591
Yes, I know.

35:43.511 --> 35:44.511
I'm sorry?

35:45.351 --> 35:48.311
She was just telling
me now about her cousin.

35:50.031 --> 35:53.951
What a terrible woman.
Not a patch on my Sabina.

35:56.151 --> 35:57.751
I can't lie for Josie anymore.

35:59.031 --> 36:02.191
Josie? As in Josie Trigorin?

36:03.351 --> 36:05.911
Yeah, and Brittany
McEwan, and Emily Havran,

36:06.151 --> 36:08.231
and any other aliases
you'd like to share with us?

36:08.871 --> 36:11.031
And I'm guessing that
you're aware that your cousin

36:11.271 --> 36:12.791
and her two boyfriends are on the run.

36:12.951 --> 36:14.071
I don't know where they are.

36:14.311 --> 36:15.631
You expect us to believe that?

36:15.871 --> 36:17.711
For all we know, you're the ringleader.

36:18.391 --> 36:21.111
Or is it this Tas or
the other guy in Prague?

36:23.111 --> 36:26.231
They're just dumb muscle.
Josie is the one in charge.

36:27.471 --> 36:28.751
How did you get involved?

36:31.711 --> 36:33.471
My father left us when I was 10.

36:35.031 --> 36:37.671
Josie supported me and my mum.

36:38.471 --> 36:39.751
She paid for my education.

36:42.351 --> 36:43.831
So you feel you were in her debt?

36:45.151 --> 36:46.591
At first, she told me...

36:48.631 --> 36:52.671
all I had to do was charm an old man
and make him fall in love with me.

36:53.111 --> 36:55.511
The old man was me, of course.

36:56.231 --> 36:58.151
At least we've got that to thank her for.

36:58.791 --> 37:00.511
The angel of death plays matchmaker.

37:01.511 --> 37:02.671
She threatened my mum.

37:04.702 --> 37:06.582
I told her I would do it,

37:06.822 --> 37:08.782
and that's when I found
out she was killing them.

37:11.622 --> 37:13.902
I even made the poison once, but I...

37:15.662 --> 37:16.902
couldn't go through with it.

37:18.982 --> 37:20.742
Nobody's ever been so good to me as Teddy.

37:22.062 --> 37:23.542
And Josie got suspicious?

37:25.502 --> 37:28.342
That's when she started sending
Tas round to threaten me.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.422
Then Lawrence showed up, and now you guys.

37:31.902 --> 37:33.382
I think I've heard just about enough.

37:33.702 --> 37:35.478
Let's wrap this up and take
these two down to the nick.

37:35.502 --> 37:38.262
Let's just... hold on a second.

37:40.022 --> 37:42.462
Josie's been doing this
for three years, at least,

37:42.662 --> 37:45.302
and she probably could have gotten
away with it for another decade,

37:45.582 --> 37:48.662
but she got greedy and she
tried to franchise the operation.

37:48.862 --> 37:50.302
But I'm... I'm thinking.

37:51.182 --> 37:54.702
I thinking that she's not willing
to let this big fish off the hook.

37:54.902 --> 37:55.902
No offense.

37:57.062 --> 37:58.062
Sabina,

38:00.542 --> 38:04.262
you must have some way worked out
where you contact each other, right?

38:05.662 --> 38:06.942
Disposable phones.

38:07.422 --> 38:08.942
I text the number, and she calls back.

38:13.022 --> 38:15.982
I'm so sorry, Josie. I was getting paranoid

38:16.182 --> 38:17.902
with the police hanging
around all the time.

38:18.142 --> 38:20.502
And then his wretched nephew Lawrence.

38:20.982 --> 38:23.302
This is no time for a mini-break, Sabina.

38:23.742 --> 38:26.542
If you can't control an old man who
can hardly walk, what good are you?

38:27.742 --> 38:28.742
I'll do better.

38:28.902 --> 38:31.782
Well, this is why you need
me, Sabina, not your daddy.

38:32.862 --> 38:35.982
I take care of you, I offer
you this amazing opportunity,

38:36.222 --> 38:37.702
and you run off when I need you most?

38:38.222 --> 38:39.702
But I have a lead.

38:41.102 --> 38:44.302
Lawrence has been siphoning
money off of Edward for years now.

38:44.502 --> 38:46.422
I think I can get to it,
but I'll need your help.

38:46.462 --> 38:47.462
How much?

38:48.742 --> 38:49.862
Half a million or more.

38:53.382 --> 38:54.382
All right.

38:55.942 --> 38:58.382
- Shall I come to the flat in Prague?
- No, not there.

38:59.542 --> 39:01.382
Let's meet someplace public.

39:02.702 --> 39:05.342
Someplace busy. I'll let
you know where and when.

39:23.182 --> 39:24.182
Everybody in position?

39:27.422 --> 39:28.422
Standing by.

39:41.862 --> 39:42.862
Line of sight.

39:57.702 --> 39:58.702
There.

39:58.982 --> 40:01.862
Emily Havran is approaching the
main entrance of the Wilsonova.

40:02.502 --> 40:03.982
Anybody make the accomplices?

40:05.542 --> 40:07.342
If they're here, they're
staying out of sight.

40:08.142 --> 40:09.142
Oh, they're here.

40:10.582 --> 40:11.582
I can feel it.

40:13.702 --> 40:15.702
Watch everybody.

40:16.102 --> 40:17.262
Attention, please.

40:17.462 --> 40:23.262
The 236 express service will
depart from platform 14 at 15:15.

40:26.502 --> 40:27.502
Cousin.

40:29.382 --> 40:30.582
Thank god you came.

40:30.902 --> 40:32.942
When have I ever let you down? Never.

40:34.622 --> 40:36.222
So, who did you bring?

40:36.742 --> 40:39.662
The police? The nephew?

40:40.542 --> 40:41.742
You said to come alone.

40:41.982 --> 40:44.022
Sabina, you never listen. Why start now?

40:45.862 --> 40:47.062
Are you ready to go on a trip?

40:48.342 --> 40:49.622
You didn't say anything about...

40:52.142 --> 40:53.182
A trip where?

40:54.622 --> 40:55.622
The end of the line.

41:00.182 --> 41:01.182
What was that?

41:02.662 --> 41:03.662
An attack.

41:07.182 --> 41:09.782
It looks like steam, not
smoke. May be a dry ice bomb.

41:10.262 --> 41:11.782
It's a diversion. Keep your eyes open.

41:14.542 --> 41:17.542
Son of a bitch! Find
Sabina! She can't be far.

41:17.782 --> 41:20.302
Louis, Emily Havran is on her
way. She's coming toward you.

41:23.182 --> 41:24.182
We can't lose them!

41:24.422 --> 41:26.702
They cannot get out this
way. Watch the trains!

41:26.862 --> 41:27.862
Guard the exits.

41:30.902 --> 41:34.782
I've got eyes of Tas, midway
down track one with Sabina in tow.

41:35.022 --> 41:36.302
I got her, I got her, I got her.

41:44.782 --> 41:45.822
Stop! Police

42:11.222 --> 42:12.262
Hickman!

42:17.742 --> 42:19.142
Hickman!

42:50.982 --> 42:53.342
Carl! Eva! Do you copy?

42:55.742 --> 42:56.742
They're fine.

42:57.902 --> 43:00.302
The local cops have
the suspects in custody.

43:18.742 --> 43:21.382
I just reviewed Josie Miller's deposition.

43:22.422 --> 43:26.182
She says her mother started this
whole killing business years ago.

43:27.102 --> 43:28.782
We have decades of victims.

43:29.902 --> 43:32.942
So this crime ring was more of
a family affair than we thought.

43:33.302 --> 43:35.262
"Was" being the operative word.

43:35.622 --> 43:37.622
Miles Lennon sends his gratitudes.

43:38.262 --> 43:40.182
Josie Miller is a bona fide psychopath.

43:41.262 --> 43:43.022
I asked her if she had any regrets,

43:43.742 --> 43:45.702
and she said that they
took up so much of her time

43:45.782 --> 43:48.702
she regretted "not having
been able to kill them faster."

43:49.862 --> 43:51.822
I suppose we all live with regrets.

43:53.622 --> 43:55.502
Sir, Dorn.

43:56.062 --> 43:57.862
Toxicology report just came in.

43:58.142 --> 44:02.782
So, uh, that cheap pine box Josie
used to bury Mr. Trigorin in...

44:02.982 --> 44:04.022
didn't do us any favors.

44:04.222 --> 44:07.342
Unfortunately the body was too
badly decomposed for analysis.

44:07.662 --> 44:08.822
And Mr. McEwan?

44:09.142 --> 44:12.102
Mr. McEwan was, as we
know, a high-profile man,

44:12.302 --> 44:14.342
so he pre-paid all his
funeral arrangements,

44:14.542 --> 44:16.462
so the body was pretty well preserved.

44:17.062 --> 44:20.262
Tissue from his liver was
positive for digitalis.

44:20.702 --> 44:22.302
Well, that puts paid to Ms. Miller.

44:22.622 --> 44:24.318
We have everything we need
to send her to prison till...

44:24.342 --> 44:25.982
she's as old as her victims were.

44:26.782 --> 44:28.462
What about Sabina Baxendale?

44:29.022 --> 44:30.182
Miles struck a deal with her.

44:31.062 --> 44:33.182
For full cooperation,
she'll be released tomorrow.

44:35.742 --> 44:36.942
Did anyone talk to Carl?

44:38.382 --> 44:39.902
He's taking the weekend off.

44:40.305 --> 44:46.860
