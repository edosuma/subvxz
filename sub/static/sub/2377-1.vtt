03:28.105 --> 03:30.005
Wait, wait,

Only the nurse, sorry
but will have to wait here.

-Look...

04:02.014 --> 04:05.014

'It's a huge house.
-'s Beautiful.

04:10.016 --> 04:12.016
'Yes, and very expensive.

04:12.317 --> 04:13.717
-Romantic...

04:17.618 --> 04:18.817
-yet is so expensive...

04:21.418 --> 04:23.819
-I know, I am the worst.

04:27.820 --> 04:31.220
Remember, Jacob and Amber
come to dinner tomorrow.

04:31.521 --> 04:33.721
Yes, I had not forgotten.

04:37.422 --> 04:39.422
- Do you really want to tell?

04:41.723 --> 04:42.423
'Yes.

04:43.824 --> 04:46.824
This time looks seriously
and I'm sick to hide it.

04:49.325 --> 04:50.925
's My best friend.

04:53.526 --> 04:55.126
- Is that okay?

04:57.127 --> 04:58.927
-You dedices.

06:02.328 --> 06:03.328
Good morning .

06:03.829 --> 06:06.729

Yes, my wife, as always.

06:17.930 --> 06:19.730
Good morning.

-Hey, how's it going?

06:25.433 --> 06:26.933
'Hello Doctor.
-Hi.

06:28.934 --> 06:30.734
- How are you?

06:31.535 --> 06:32.735
Watch Me.

06:34.236 --> 06:36.136
- So, is everything okay?
Yes, all right.

06:40.937 --> 06:44.137
Hello, sir, you better see this morning.

06:44.338 --> 06:46.138
'Yes, I slept well.

06:47.139 --> 06:49.339
-Hey, how are you Paul?
-I'm fine.

06:49.340 --> 06:53.340
'Well, I think he's going down, I think
is over fifty.

06:53.341 --> 06:54.341
'Very well.

07:01.142 --> 07:02.342
Good morning.

07:03.443 --> 07:05.943
-I have a secret for you.
- What?

07:07.644 --> 07:09.044
'I leave here.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.345
- Really?

07:10.346 --> 07:11.546
-'ve Come to get you.

07:11.747 --> 07:13.747
- Yes!
- Are you happy?

07:14.448 --> 07:15.748
I'm sad....

07:16.649 --> 07:18.149
I'll miss you.

07:18.750 --> 07:21.050
And you to me?
-Sure.

07:21.051 --> 07:23.651
'Okay, is good.
Yes.

07:25.952 --> 07:28.152
-Just have to be careful with blood,

07:28.153 --> 07:33.153
if you are injured or damaged in some way, be sure to wear gloves
.

07:33.354 --> 07:36.154
- Do we need to take any other precautions
special?

07:36.655 --> 07:39.155
-
Same as with any other child his age.

07:39.256 --> 07:40.556
- The same?

07:41.057 --> 07:45.257
Ha injected with it every day of his life,
and if it does you can...

07:45.258 --> 07:46.258
-must.

07:48.859 --> 07:50.459
When they brought here last week,

07:50.460 --> 07:52.860
would have been relieved with this result.

07:53.261 --> 07:56.261
-Being a "Returned" is a privilege, not a curse
.

07:56.662 --> 07:58.162
-Do not patronize me.

07:58.963 --> 08:01.463
-I just try to help.

08:00.464 --> 08:01.764
-Well, you can not help,

08:01.765 --> 08:05.665
Okay?, Because you have no fucking idea what is
love someone with this.

08:12.966 --> 08:14.666
- Is it true what they say doctor?

08:14.667 --> 08:17.667
What almost no protein reserves
and can not make more?

08:18.268 --> 08:20.368
'That's a ridiculous rumor.

08:21.469 --> 08:23.469
His son was saved,

08:24.070 --> 08:29.070
go home and enjoy it,
do not worry about this.

08:31.571 --> 08:33.071
Thank you.

08:50.672 --> 08:51.872
'Very well.

08:54.873 --> 08:55.873
-Mark.

08:56.074 --> 08:57.074
Come

08:57.075 --> 08:59.675
-No, it's too hard for me, sir.

08:59.676 --> 09:02.276
Is very complicated.
-I can do it, have faith, come here.

09:02.277 --> 09:03.277
- No, seriously,

09:03.278 --> 09:09.078
Look like one of the returnees,
every time I try my hands tremble

09:10.979 --> 09:13.179
'Okay, well then over here, come.

09:14.080 --> 09:15.580
-No, I just wanted...
- Out!

09:16.581 --> 09:17.581
'Okay.

09:23.082 --> 09:27.882
'Well, well, remember your pentatonic and
...

09:27.883 --> 09:30.883
... good night to all,
pummeling.

09:37.384 --> 09:38.884
"DEATH TO RETURNING"

09:51.785 --> 09:52.985
Good night.

10:11.486 --> 10:13.486
'Hello Kate.
-Hi.

10:15.287 --> 10:19.387
-You know, I will not give you an increase by
you leave late Friday.

10:19.388 --> 10:20.488
-Oh, I know.

10:23.588 --> 10:26.488
-Johan says the boy's parents are very concerned
.

10:27.089 --> 10:29.089
-Ya, is evident.

10:30.090 --> 10:33.090
- You tell them not to worry?

10:34.791 --> 10:36.991
- What else can I say?
-Ya.

10:37.892 --> 10:40.992
'Well, take care Kate.

10:41.893 --> 10:43.993
When did you eat something  last?

10:45.494 --> 10:47.994
See us.
-Good weekend.

10:55.395 --> 10:58.395
- How's it going out there?
-Another day, same shit.

10:58.996 --> 10:59.996
Jesus...

11:08.297 --> 11:08.997
-Forgiveness.

11:25.198 --> 11:26.198
Thank you.

11:54.099 --> 11:55.099
'Hello.

11:58.900 --> 11:59.900
Thank you.

12:28.301 --> 12:29.301
'Here .

12:29.302 --> 12:31.602
Thanks, good weekend.
-Also, take care.

12:36.003 --> 12:38.003
-The situation is complicated by the minute.

12:38.504 --> 12:40.704
Previously demonstrations against returnees

12:40.705 --> 12:42.705
be used in rehabilitation centers

12:42.706 --> 12:45.306
now are being
direct attacks throughout the city.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.807
The last one occurred in the
Castle Prank,

12:47.808 --> 12:51.608
where the full light of day, a
returned was assaulted by two masked men.

12:51.809 --> 12:55.609
No
is the first time that such incidents happen but...

13:03.610 --> 13:08.110
-Oh my God, here
smells wonderful!

13:08.111 --> 13:09.611
-I hope he's just as good.

13:12.712 --> 13:15.712
-I have five more.
-Well.

13:18.913 --> 13:20.113
-You smell good.

13:21.914 --> 13:24.614
Can you guardarmelos?
They'll be here soon.

13:24.615 --> 13:26.215
- What time come?

13:27.816 --> 13:29.816
-In about ten minutes or so.

13:40.617 --> 13:44.817
My God, it's great, I mean,
are just a couple of reviews so...

13:45.218 --> 13:49.218
'Okay, okay, and we say,
're here all weekend.

13:50.119 --> 13:51.319
'Okay, take care.

13:53.720 --> 13:56.220
- What was that?
-Oh, my God.

13:56.321 --> 13:58.321
- What have won the Pulitzer or what?

14:00.722 --> 14:02.722
-This woman goes
national book tour.

14:03.423 --> 14:07.423
Is what he said, was what we talked...
and have been out a couple of reviews,

14:07.424 --> 14:09.224
- So? Are they good? Nena...-

14:09.225 --> 14:11.625
My God.
-Well, come on toast.

14:11.626 --> 14:15.626
-
Can not do this to us without telling us that's the book.

14:15.627 --> 14:20.927
At least you tell us how many times
get the word "lust" in this,

14:20.928 --> 14:23.428
Because we have done  bets.
-Yeah, very funny.

14:24.229 --> 14:26.229
-Have bet money, come on.

14:26.230 --> 14:31.730
'Actually, it's the story of a guy who finds
inconceivable death.

14:32.731 --> 14:36.331
-'s Crazy, can not believe
that will happen,

14:36.332 --> 14:39.332
and is sure that there must be some kind of exception
for him.

14:39.733 --> 14:40.933
-Do not die.

14:40.934 --> 14:44.934
-If, and when the time comes somehow escape
,

14:44.935 --> 14:47.835
something happen and save.

14:49.636 --> 14:51.736
-That is wishful thinking.
-I know.

14:51.737 --> 14:54.237
Until one day, a routine checkup
,

14:54.638 --> 14:56.438
you discover a tumor.

14:56.639 --> 14:59.639
No doctor gives you more
than four months.

15:01.640 --> 15:02.640
- Shit!

15:02.741 --> 15:06.341
The guy is taking it personally, as if fate
insulted him.

15:06.342 --> 15:08.842
So decide which will be making noise,

15:08.843 --> 15:11.343
Murdering one person every day.

15:13.844 --> 15:16.344
- It's amazing, right?
-It's sadistic.

15:16.345 --> 15:18.645
'Okay, but why, why...
?

15:18.646 --> 15:21.846
-Think contacting
indirectly with death deliberately

15:21.847 --> 15:24.047
then be able to understand.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.448
- And get get somewhere?

15:25.549 --> 15:28.249
'Of course not, just like all buried.

15:28.350 --> 15:30.150
Without actually understand.

15:30.151 --> 15:33.151
'That's why I love my wife, I used to write romance novels
,

15:33.152 --> 15:35.852
but it is actually the most dramatic
person on the face of the earth.

15:35.853 --> 15:38.653
Congratulations darling, I love you.
-And I love you.

15:38.654 --> 15:43.654
-'s An interesting story,
a little sadistic for my taste.

15:44.555 --> 15:50.955
But somehow fits the
why I invited them for dinner tonight.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.256
- Is there something wrong?

15:55.557 --> 15:57.057
-Quiet  not I have a tumor.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.758
'Well, thank God.

16:00.759 --> 16:04.259
That his story becomes reality is the nightmare of any author.

16:04.260 --> 16:06.860
Well, that depends on the story right?

16:09.461 --> 16:10.761
- What is it?

16:14.062 --> 16:16.262
-Walking down the street one day,

16:17.263 --> 16:19.763
and that's when I saw her.

16:21.764 --> 16:25.164
I never thought I would find that guitar, but it was there.

16:25.865 --> 16:28.465
Was totamente sure it was my lucky day.

16:38.866 --> 16:39.766
- Hello?

16:41.567 --> 16:45.567
No one was behind the counter,
guess I should leave.

16:46.768 --> 16:47.768
But I did not.

16:52.169 --> 16:53.269
- Hello?

17:05.770 --> 17:07.770
I saw the man.

17:08.070 --> 17:08.971
Shit!

17:09.372 --> 17:11.571
Hey, hey!
Dude, come on!

17:12.272 --> 17:15.272
I thought I was under attack,
so I went down to try to help,

17:15.273 --> 17:20.273
Grabbed my wallet and put it in your mouth for
not bitten tongue and...

17:22.275 --> 17:24.575
I just brushed your teeth.

17:27.376 --> 17:29.376
Just a scratch,

17:30.377 --> 17:33.377
but sometimes the little things can grow
.

17:36.378 --> 17:38.478
-Emergency, how I can help?

17:38.479 --> 17:42.479
... Yes .. I do not know,
I think I could have it.

17:42.980 --> 17:44.780
- What are the symptoms sir?

17:44.781 --> 17:48.781
-Cold sweat, palpitations, shortness of breath
.

17:48.782 --> 17:50.782
- Please, can I have your name, sir?

17:50.783 --> 17:52.783
-Alex Green.

17:55.284 --> 17:58.784
The military took me to one of these mobile hospitals
.

18:04.385 --> 18:06.885
I saw bodies in the halls.

18:08.386 --> 18:10.386
A few of them had been shot,

18:11.787 --> 18:13.787
a blank in the head.

18:15.188 --> 18:17.188
I guess I opened my eyes too soon.

18:19.589 --> 18:22.089
few hours spent strapped to that gurney,

18:22.090 --> 18:24.590
not know if you ever come out of that hole
.

18:26.591 --> 18:28.691
- He said he woke up on the way here?

18:29.992 --> 18:31.592
Forget what you have seen.

18:31.593 --> 18:36.193
This tumbaría an elephant tranquilizer,
cause hallucinations in patients.

18:38.494 --> 18:41.194
We have the results,
this shit is not going to kill him.

18:41.595 --> 18:47.195
Do you know? every time
the first dose does not work, it kills me.

18:47.196 --> 18:50.696
So congratulations son,
almost do not tell.

18:53.197 --> 18:55.697
Then I transferred to a civilian hospital.

18:56.298 --> 18:58.498
And that's where I met Kate.

18:59.299 --> 19:00.799
So...

19:00.800 --> 19:02.500
... six years ago,

19:05.301 --> 19:06.801
I returned.

19:09.202 --> 19:13.002
I want you to know because it might be true this time
stocks are completed.

19:13.003 --> 19:16.503
I thought, should know.

20:40.804 --> 20:42.804
Thank you.
-See you next month.

20:57.505 --> 20:59.705
Let's get out of here!

21:05.406 --> 21:07.406
Back here!

21:10.107 --> 21:13.407
- Please do not hurt me!
I want to be normal!

21:14.108 --> 21:15.608
Do not hurt me.

21:32.309 --> 21:35.509
-If a returned no
is injected into a 36-hour period,

21:36.010 --> 21:39.010
the spread of virus in the body becomes irreversible.

21:39.811 --> 21:45.011
These statistics are irrefutable,
not a single case to prove the contrary.

21:46.112 --> 21:48.612
And we all know the consequences that entails.

21:51.213 --> 21:55.513
Well, do not have official figures
compared to the first outbreak.

21:56.014 --> 22:01.014
But most of us have experienced at least one case
firsthand.

22:02.615 --> 22:07.615
However, we believe that there were more
hundred million deaths worldwide.

22:09.416 --> 22:14.516
The outbreak can not be compared with any other tragedy
known in modern history

22:15.217 --> 22:19.017
Trauma  That is what pushed us
to start looking for a solution.

22:19.018 --> 22:22.018
And ten years later, protein return
,

22:22.019 --> 22:26.019
was the big prize which
humanity was rewarded.

22:26.520 --> 22:30.020
And so, after the inevitable
second outbreak

22:30.021 --> 22:32.521
we were able to save so many people.

22:34.422 --> 22:40.722
A returnee is someone who has had the great misfortune
contracting the virus,

22:40.823 --> 22:45.923
yet the vast fortune
has been treated in the early hours.

22:47.324 --> 22:50.324
As everyone knows, the virus persists
.

22:51.025 --> 22:52.625
We can not cure it.

22:52.626 --> 22:53.626
Yet.

22:53.627 --> 22:58.627
But now at least we can control if we arrived on time.

23:00.628 --> 23:04.628
Return protein is like a barrier,
as a retaining wall.

23:05.229 --> 23:10.829
Incuvado  The virus is still there, but the daily dose
keeps it at a safe distance.

23:11.930 --> 23:14.230
The problem of lack of natural protein
,

23:14.231 --> 23:17.231
end with the creation of a synthetic alternative.

23:17.632 --> 23:22.232
This will
infected guaranteed lifelong treatment.

23:22.933 --> 23:27.933
A cut in funding private
be a disaster, believe me.

23:28.434 --> 23:32.834
For returnees, of course, but for what
society as a whole.

23:32.835 --> 23:35.335
'Yes, but there are two things that omitted mention
.

23:37.336 --> 23:41.536
'Please ilústrenos,
here everyone is free to express.

23:41.637 --> 23:42.837
-Very friendly.

23:44.138 --> 23:47.138
's People,
are time bombs.

23:47.139 --> 23:50.539
Until we find the synthetic protein,
are a threat.

23:50.540 --> 23:54.040
If a dose is skipped, one!,
No turning back.

23:54.041 --> 23:57.441
-Precisely why we need to continue investigating.

23:57.442 --> 24:02.642
And this is a very expensive treatment,
who keep all their lives.

24:02.643 --> 24:07.843
'Yes, do not deny it, but
face another epidemic like 20 years ago...

24:07.844 --> 24:11.244
-There are alternatives.
-... Would be much more expensive for everyone.

24:11.245 --> 24:13.445
-There are alternatives.

24:14.646 --> 24:16.846
'Please share them with us.

24:17.647 --> 24:20.147
He could make them live in special camps
,

24:20.248 --> 24:22.448
outside cities,
away from children.

24:22.649 --> 24:25.449
-O can remove them.
-I never said that.

24:25.550 --> 24:26.950
'But you think.

24:27.651 --> 24:31.251
For that matter, because
rid of smokers, diabetics,

24:31.752 --> 24:33.652
and obese as we are.

24:33.653 --> 24:38.453
I mean  besides
cost us a lot of money, it is also unpleasant view.

24:43.554 --> 24:48.054
Well, that was... different.

24:49.055 --> 24:50.155
- Too rude?

24:50.356 --> 24:53.456
-No, no, no, you've just called
fat idiot.

24:53.457 --> 24:56.257
-Was an idiot, which turned out to be fat,

24:56.258 --> 24:58.758
and now seem to have
prejudice against fat people.

24:58.759 --> 25:00.459
'Yes, among other things.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.260
- Think you bring money?

25:02.661 --> 25:04.861
- Who? Is the fat idiot? No.

25:05.162 --> 25:09.362
Fuck you, everyone else bring something
because you were sensational, okay?.

25:10.363 --> 25:13.863
-Correct me if I'm wrong but the
natural protein can be extracted only

25:13.864 --> 25:17.564
spinal fluid of infected
those who have died.

25:17.565 --> 25:19.765
Fortunately there are fewer returnees

25:19.866 --> 25:24.166
But that also means there is less
sources from which to extract the protein.

25:24.167 --> 25:26.867
Exactly,
-This is a vicious circle,

25:26.868 --> 25:29.768
so unless returned reserves equals less protein.

25:29.769 --> 25:33.569
This has led to restrictions enforced
in access to treatment,

25:33.570 --> 25:37.670
the consequences of these restrictions,
is what worries the authorities,

25:37.671 --> 25:40.271
especially after the tension of recent weeks.

25:44.372 --> 25:47.372
Sixty-Put me please.
My father is in, it charges you.

26:03.373 --> 26:05.373
-Sixty.
Yes, it is.

26:06.174 --> 26:07.174
RETURNED

26:15.375 --> 26:16.175
Thank you.

26:26.176 --> 26:29.676
'All right, nice people, nice music
.

26:43.177 --> 26:46.177
I have night shift, there
dinner in the oven. I love you.

27:58.578 --> 28:02.078
-Damn, just spent half the night,
I am not able to get used to the shift.

28:02.879 --> 28:06.279
'I is not much, are the three,
your turn is almost over.

28:06.380 --> 28:07.580
Then I see.

28:31.781 --> 28:33.581
-Are perfect.

28:33.882 --> 28:37.882
I mean, I think Tristan and Josh
can go home early.

28:38.083 --> 28:40.583
'I hope, Josh has been here a long time.

28:50.284 --> 28:53.784
- Where the fuck are you going? put against the wall.
You! there. Come on, come on!

28:55.385 --> 28:58.585
-Quiet and calladitas,
this has nothing to do with you.

29:03.786 --> 29:05.286
'Here, take it.

29:14.287 --> 29:18.587
- Have to have nerves of steel to take care of those
zombies is not it?

29:19.088 --> 29:21.488
What should then
tears and shaking?

29:21.489 --> 29:23.489
-There are zombies,
have been returned.

29:23.490 --> 29:24.690
- What did you say?

29:25.591 --> 29:30.091
Listen here bitch,
because it seems to speak my language.

29:30.792 --> 29:32.992
Are zombies.
Is that clear?

29:36.493 --> 29:37.693
-'re Not.

29:38.194 --> 29:40.194
- Hell, what if they are!
Repeat!

29:40.195 --> 29:42.495
-I'm telling you,
are not zombies.

29:45.996 --> 29:48.496
And I am telling you they are.

29:55.197 --> 29:59.197
Repeat bitch.
Come on, say it.

30:00.998 --> 30:04.498
Okay, I'll get you
a bullet in the head bitch. I say it.

30:08.299 --> 30:09.499
-'re Not.

30:11.100 --> 30:13.300
- Forget them!
We have to get out of here!

30:13.701 --> 30:15.201
-It's your lucky day.

30:17.602 --> 30:21.102
Do not move a fucking muscle is that clear?
- Come out of here!

30:55.703 --> 30:57.903
- Who's in charge?

30:58.104 --> 30:59.004
-I.

31:00.205 --> 31:02.205
God... we...

31:02.406 --> 31:04.406
I've never seen anything like it.

31:07.806 --> 31:10.206
-There's a first time for everything.

31:10.607 --> 31:11.807
Unfortunately.

31:19.308 --> 31:21.808
Let's see who are in the recordings.

31:21.809 --> 31:24.509
-I already said, wearing balaclavas.

31:35.710 --> 31:37.910
-Soon will come the vultures of the press.

31:38.911 --> 31:42.111
There is nothing they like better than a good
piece of fresh meat.

31:47.812 --> 31:49.112
Go home.

31:49.613 --> 31:51.013
'Yes, thank you.

32:46.714 --> 32:48.914
- What is it?

32:48.915 --> 32:53.915
Baby, baby, okay, okay
honey, okay.

33:04.516 --> 33:08.816
-Is multiplatform,
that's what we already know, and they lack leadership

33:08.817 --> 33:13.717
however, many people would want them to be more emphatic
condemning these acts.

33:13.718 --> 33:16.918
-Platform "non-return"
condemns the criminal acts like last night,

33:16.919 --> 33:18.119
we have always done.

33:18.120 --> 33:20.620
'Yes, but never before have we seen
an act of such magnitude.

33:20.721 --> 33:23.221
What you think is the cause of increased
these attacks?

33:23.222 --> 33:26.222
-Fear.
- And fear justifies such barbarism?

33:26.223 --> 33:27.823
-Do not put words in my mouth.

33:27.924 --> 33:31.724
True, the Health Service
controls most of the returnees,

33:31.725 --> 33:33.725
but we also know that there are cracks in the system.

33:33.726 --> 33:37.026
There are a fringe group outside the control
physician as homeless people for example.

33:37.027 --> 33:39.527
-Y protein intolerant.
Yes, like that, exactly.

33:39.528 --> 33:45.128
Do you remember what happened when that returned
stopped taking their daily dose without warning?

33:45.129 --> 33:49.329
In less than 24 hours without treatment that
man attacked five people.

33:49.730 --> 33:50.930
We had to kill them all.

33:50.931 --> 33:53.131
-Psycho, psycho fucking suicidal.

33:54.132 --> 33:57.332
- Do you think a person in a thousand justified...

33:57.633 --> 33:58.433
-Jesus...

34:01.634 --> 34:03.634
'All right, quiet.

34:08.935 --> 34:11.735
'Well, how long a break?

34:12.036 --> 34:14.036
-One month.
- A month?

34:15.036 --> 34:18.036
Kate , I need you,
damn, you're my best doctor.

34:19.538 --> 34:23.538
Please at least tell me you will not let
fundraising conferences okay?

34:25.438 --> 34:26.539
Please.

34:27.040 --> 34:29.040
'No, that will not quit.

34:29.741 --> 34:31.341
Thank God.

34:40.242 --> 34:42.442
- Are they kidding?

34:51.643 --> 34:54.842
The girl clinic
wants to go to her home.

34:55.543 --> 34:57.644
Says that there is safer.

34:58.945 --> 35:01.945
But he lives miles away.

35:02.446 --> 35:04.446
- Do you want to go with you?

35:04.947 --> 35:07.547
-No, I think I better go alone.

35:08.748 --> 35:12.548
-I do not want people to know about you,
and even less now.

35:16.849 --> 35:20.049
'Hello, do you know where I can find the building manager
?

35:20.250 --> 35:24.050
'Yes, climb the stairs apartment No. 4,
says "Administrator" on the door.

36:55.551 --> 36:58.151
- Have you seen anyone enter?
-No.

36:59.152 --> 37:01.952
I mean ,
do not know, I have not fixed.

37:01.953 --> 37:04.953
'Well, please look
next time, just in case.

37:05.054 --> 37:05.954
Okay?

37:07.055 --> 37:11.055
After the attack the other day,
things have gotten much in the hospital.

37:11.056 --> 37:12.456
So I no longer think it's a good site

37:12.457 --> 37:15.457
for two classy women,
like us, do business.

37:17.958 --> 37:19.458
- Is there nothing more?

37:19.659 --> 37:21.259
I mean
money is no problem.

37:21.460 --> 37:24.460
Lame-Ya but realize too
to take inventory.

37:24.461 --> 37:26.961
Only I can catch a few at a time.

37:33.562 --> 37:36.062
We have not received
heading lab this week.

37:36.363 --> 37:37.263
- What?

37:37.664 --> 37:41.064
-
Other hospitals also have received so ..

37:44.165 --> 37:46.165
- How much is you booking?

37:47.366 --> 37:48.866
'As for a month.

37:55.667 --> 37:58.367
- Can you bring me next week
please?

37:59.168 --> 38:01.168
I'll pay whatever.

38:01.469 --> 38:02.469
Please.

38:04.270 --> 38:07.470
'Okay, I can not guarantee it but I'll try
.

38:07.571 --> 38:09.871
Will cost four times more this time.

38:09.972 --> 38:11.772
-I told you money is not a problem.

38:12.173 --> 38:14.173
'Okay, give me a few days.

38:15.874 --> 38:16.974
Thank you.

38:28.975 --> 38:30.775
- Is it for you?

38:31.576 --> 38:33.676
Are you one of the returnees?

39:05.377 --> 39:09.577
The fucking bastards not only killed,
also took records.

39:09.878 --> 39:11.678
- With all patient records?

39:11.679 --> 39:15.679
-Also took hard drives,
in them had addresses, phone numbers.

39:15.980 --> 39:18.480
All you need to fuck them good.

39:19.281 --> 39:22.281
So if you're one of them,
please be careful.

39:23.582 --> 39:24.582
Thank you.

39:43.583 --> 39:44.783
- Hey, buddy!

39:44.784 --> 39:47.784
- What are you doing here?
-Hawkers.

39:48.185 --> 39:50.285
- A coming glasses?
- You like?

39:50.486 --> 39:51.986
'Yes, very sophisticated.

39:52.187 --> 39:55.187
-Go does not want people to think I'm sophisticated
.

39:55.188 --> 39:56.888
Anyway  false.

39:57.089 --> 39:59.389
-Kidding me, have you
you become one of those guys?

39:59.190 --> 40:00.790
'I am one of those.

40:01.391 --> 40:03.091
Want a drink?

40:04.591 --> 40:05.991
Always.
-Let's go to Spendler.

40:05.992 --> 40:07.392
- Al Spendler, whatever?.

40:10.593 --> 40:13.093
- How is Kate?
-More or less.

40:13.794 --> 40:16.794
It has taken some time off work in
after what happened the other day

40:17.295 --> 40:18.495
It's too hard.

40:20.996 --> 40:23.196
But it
is stronger than it looks.

40:26.297 --> 40:28.097
I am a lucky man.

40:31.798 --> 40:34.098
-We both are.

40:34.599 --> 40:37.099
'True, but you're a rich man
lucky.

40:42.200 --> 40:43.700
What is this?

40:47.001 --> 40:49.001
- What is that?
Do not know, you know,

40:49.402 --> 40:50.602
you know  25 years

40:50.603 --> 40:53.103
and told me that the other day
and did not give you a hug, so...

40:56.604 --> 40:59.104
-Was not a shit
I have been able to tell before.

41:02.205 --> 41:04.205
'Okay, I just want you to know...

41:05.706 --> 41:07.606
... for me still the same.

41:07.807 --> 41:08.607
Okay?

41:09.608 --> 41:14.408
Still the same shit that got me
a pellet in the leg, makes a lot of years

41:14.409 --> 41:16.909
-You deserved it.
-I know, but who cares.

41:18.910 --> 41:22.510
Anyway, what I mean is that I do not care
,

41:23.111 --> 41:25.611
I do not care what happened to you,
I do not care what this is,

41:26.512 --> 41:28.412

42:40.016 --> 42:42.516
Said, he must prove not why.

42:51.017 --> 42:52.517
Are you okay?

42:53.218 --> 42:54.618
Do not worry, you're done.

43:09.319 --> 43:10.819
-Get rid of it.

We can not, are we okay,
will ask questions, they will pull the thread?.

43:41.722 --> 43:45.022
-Being a returnee is not a fucking crime.
-Yeah, but can now be a problem.

45:41.851 --> 45:44.851
'No thanks brother, but not
, too.

45:48.752 --> 45:50.552
-All will be well.

47:14.553 --> 47:16.653
-Hundred and fourteen.

47:17.454 --> 47:19.454
- You also tell him?

47:26.555 --> 47:28.555
-And whisper them.

47:31.056 --> 47:33.456
Caress And saying nice things.

47:35.457 --> 47:37.257
But not multiply.

47:38.658 --> 47:40.258
-Motherfuckers.

47:46.259 --> 47:48.459
-Do not look like much, but it does its function
.

47:48.860 --> 47:50.460
-It should not be legal.

47:51.161 --> 47:55.261
-Treat is a sticky, sweet and greasy
, will, eat it.

48:16.062 --> 48:17.362
-I have news.

48:18.563 --> 48:20.763
-
Returnees Seven dead in St. John Hospital,

48:20.764 --> 48:21.964
and twelve in the Central.

48:22.465 --> 48:24.965
Attacked two places at once
around two in the morning.

48:26.966 --> 48:27.966
-Awesome.

48:30.267 --> 48:31.767
What did the police say?

48:31.968 --> 48:32.968
-The shit.

48:33.169 --> 48:36.969
That can not ensure that groups have been
backstop, but not good.

48:38.770 --> 48:40.570
And that's not the worst of it.

48:47.571 --> 48:50.371
They say it's only until the synthetic protein function
.

48:50.372 --> 48:52.372
-No
let you go to one of those sites.

48:52.473 --> 48:54.473
-Han given three days to spare.

48:55.074 --> 48:56.774
-Plan to publish lists, Kate.

48:57.575 --> 49:01.075
Any returned not delivered to a monitoring center will be arrested.

49:01.576 --> 49:03.076
- Observation center?

49:03.077 --> 49:04.877
So you're kidding Jacob?

49:05.078 --> 49:06.878
Sound like them.

49:07.679 --> 49:08.579
Look at that!

49:12.780 --> 49:16.280
-Try to convince Alex.
Come to the house with us.

49:16.281 --> 49:19.681
Is a safe place,
go talk to him, let him come.

49:20.382 --> 49:23.382
Go talk to him, pick up his stuff and let's get out of here
once.

50:19.183 --> 50:21.483
'm Your agent!
'm Your fucking agent!

50:21.684 --> 50:24.684
Okay, you know what?
Now you're talking, talking, blah blah blah

50:24.785 --> 50:26.685
not understand a word
what you're saying.

50:26.986 --> 50:28.086
-Need more conflict.

50:28.087 --> 50:30.387
-Okay, more conflict, more conflict
Here, okay?

50:30.488 --> 50:33.288
Should not feel that way now, but
is forced feelings,

50:33.389 --> 50:36.189
and I am forced to do this,
you get up the ass!

50:39.590 --> 50:41.590
'Brother, I love when you are angry.

50:41.591 --> 50:43.091
- Oh yeah?
-Si.

51:12.092 --> 51:14.292
Alex is lucky to have you.

51:15.293 --> 51:16.293
- Why do you say that?

51:17.394 --> 51:19.894
-'m A writer,
I notice things in people.

51:21.295 --> 51:22.895
- What do you notice?

51:23.996 --> 51:26.196
-Do not leave to pity himself.

51:27.097 --> 51:29.597
Do not treat me like a sick or an invalid.

51:32.198 --> 51:33.398
'Because it is not.

51:55.999 --> 51:57.499
-This is a little creepy.

51:58.500 --> 52:00.100
- Have you inectado today?

52:04.401 --> 52:06.201
-I want to eat your brains.

52:06.602 --> 52:08.702
'Okay, start with your wife.

52:09.203 --> 52:13.203
I do not want to eat hers.
-It's too brain.

53:09.104 --> 53:10.604
"Military use force on citizens
"

53:10.605 --> 53:13.405
Van-home people.
'I have done before.

53:13.506 --> 53:14.706
'No, not this way.

53:15.207 --> 53:18.707
-No taking people by force and against her will
as the gestapo bitch.

53:19.908 --> 53:21.708
Therefore  I love Kate.

53:22.309 --> 53:24.009
So I want to have her.

53:25.210 --> 53:27.010
-You can not even shoot.

53:28.011 --> 53:31.011
'Any idiot can fire a gun,
aim and pull the trigger.

53:31.412 --> 53:33.212
-Let's not exaggerate.

53:33.613 --> 53:36.413
Here we are safe.
No, we're not.

53:37.014 --> 53:38.414
Are very close to the city.

53:38.415 --> 53:39.415
And...

53:40.816 --> 53:42.716
... is too risky for Jacob and Amber.

53:42.917 --> 53:45.717
'But we are not gunmen,
for the love of God.

53:46.118 --> 53:49.018
-Before we were not,
but I have no idea what we are now.

53:50.019 --> 53:51.219
Everything has changed.

53:58.820 --> 54:01.120
Got a better idea?
What to do?

54:01.121 --> 54:03.521
- I do not know, whatever,
not want a gun in the house!

54:33.522 --> 54:36.022
-Come on, we'll call the elevator, hurry.

54:46.823 --> 54:48.023
Jesus!

54:48.624 --> 54:51.624
-'m Detective Call,
this is Detective Anderson.

54:51.625 --> 54:54.125
We're here to see Alex Green.

54:54.826 --> 54:56.426
-Solo will be five minutes.

55:05.427 --> 55:07.227
'Well, is not.

55:07.828 --> 55:10.628
What the hell is this,
presented here unannounced,

55:12.029 --> 55:15.029
With a warrant, and I teach my floor
. I'm late.

55:15.230 --> 55:16.530
-Only orders we fulfill lady.

55:16.731 --> 55:20.031
-This home is listed, the sooner we start before
ended.

55:21.632 --> 55:23.632
'I went three weeks ago.

55:24.233 --> 55:26.133
- It was three weeks ago?

55:27.134 --> 55:30.134
-Or four.
The eleventh day.

55:31.035 --> 55:32.735
- For some reason in particular?

55:36.936 --> 55:38.536
'Not that I know of.

55:38.537 --> 55:40.537
'You are men,
certainly know better than me

55:40.538 --> 55:43.538
what goes through the head of a man
before leaving a woman.

55:46.739 --> 55:48.539
-Need to see the rest of the apartment.

55:48.540 --> 55:50.740
- This is really annoying!

55:53.541 --> 55:55.341
The sound studio.

56:11.442 --> 56:12.942
The -room.

56:46.343 --> 56:48.743
- Do you have any idea where
have gone?

57:01.744 --> 57:03.544
- I shot him in the head!

57:05.045 --> 57:07.245
I shot him in the fucking head!

57:08.246 --> 57:09.246
Oh my God!

57:11.647 --> 57:13.447
He finished dosages.

57:14.648 --> 57:16.648
- Why not take him
Observation Center?

57:17.949 --> 57:19.649
I did not want to go.

57:20.050 --> 57:21.650
- Why did not compel him?

57:22.951 --> 57:25.951
-Because actually was right in not wanting to.

57:27.452 --> 57:29.452
She had been monitored and controlled.

57:29.453 --> 57:33.153
My God,
would let him die.

57:33.454 --> 57:35.554
You know that those sites are.

57:36.355 --> 57:38.855
Would have died surrounded by strangers.

57:48.356 --> 57:50.356
Have I gotten into a mess, is not it?

57:52.257 --> 57:53.657
Well, in theory yes.

57:55.758 --> 57:57.358
- And in practice?

57:58.459 --> 58:00.459
Our job is 
-mark X on a list.

58:00.660 --> 58:02.660
If what you are saying is true,

58:02.661 --> 58:05.661
our work is done and we will remove
frankly a load off.

58:07.662 --> 58:09.462
Need to see the body.

58:23.163 --> 58:24.063
-Okay, but,

58:24.864 --> 58:28.064
After it's over?
Will not there be questions?

58:32.165 --> 58:33.265
-No questions asked.

58:36.566 --> 58:37.366
-Right.

59:46.167 --> 59:47.067
- Hello!

01:00:01.968 --> 01:00:02.868
Hello?

01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.969
'Okay.

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:21.870
Well, this thing very quickly decomposes
bodies.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:25.071
What I can say is:
What is a male,

01:02:26.272 --> 01:02:27.972
thirtysomething,

01:02:30.173 --> 01:02:31.973
with a single shot to the head.

01:02:35.574 --> 01:02:38.574
'All right, do not need to pick it out, call the
Rescue Unit.

01:02:39.575 --> 01:02:40.975
We have enough on our own.

01:02:41.976 --> 01:02:43.576
My companion take home.

01:03:02.977 --> 01:03:03.677
Thank you.

01:03:03.678 --> 01:03:06.078
-If it makes you feel better, I think
did the right thing.

01:03:06.679 --> 01:03:10.279
In a few hours they will announce that no synthetic protein
when thought.

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:13.380
Not seem to work the way
when they said it would.

01:03:13.681 --> 01:03:15.281
Things are complicated.

01:03:19.382 --> 01:03:20.282
Thank you.

01:03:44.283 --> 01:03:47.283
- You all right?
Yes, I'm fine.

01:03:49.184 --> 01:03:51.084
-Kate spoke to Eve.

01:03:51.085 --> 01:03:54.085
She is the woman who has been helping with
protein supply.

01:03:55.086 --> 01:03:58.086
We have got sixty doses so...

01:03:59.287 --> 01:04:00.187
- How?

01:04:00.988 --> 01:04:03.788
'So we'll go
the morning to pick them up.

01:04:04.089 --> 01:04:06.589
And then we'll go far away from here as possible.

01:04:07.090 --> 01:04:08.190
- Sixty dose?

01:04:08.591 --> 01:04:11.191
Well, that gives them some time.
-Si.

01:04:11.692 --> 01:04:14.192
-If they do
by us is not necessary.

01:04:14.593 --> 01:04:15.693
Did you know  true?

01:04:16.594 --> 01:04:17.494
-Know.

01:04:18.695 --> 01:04:21.095
They say that will fix
Alex within days.

01:04:21.096 --> 01:04:25.296
O well, you know,
weeks at most, you will make that work.

01:04:26.297 --> 01:04:29.297
'd Better get going.

01:04:29.998 --> 01:04:31.798
's Too dangerous.

01:04:33.199 --> 01:04:35.799
-
But thanks for all you've done.

01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:41.800
The negative results of recent tests
made us delay our expectations

01:04:42.201 --> 01:04:45.401
The synthetic protein has not been synthesized yet.

01:04:46.502 --> 01:04:52.502
However
government laboratories continue to struggle to find a solution

01:04:53.103 --> 01:04:58.603
Our hopes are still intact, since
everything can change in the coming weeks.

01:04:59.604 --> 01:05:04.104
All sectors of the population should remain calm and
can be sure

01:05:04.105 --> 01:05:07.905
we have
control and we will address this.

01:05:09.006 --> 01:05:11.006
Thanks , there will be questions.

01:05:31.707 --> 01:05:32.707
Good morning.

01:05:34.408 --> 01:05:35.108
'Hello.

01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:37.309
- Would you like a coffee?
-No thanks.

01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:43.210
- Looking for this?

01:05:43.811 --> 01:05:46.311
-Si, where was I?
-On the couch.

01:05:47.412 --> 01:05:48.912
-You're up early.

01:05:48.913 --> 01:05:53.713
'Yes, Amber,
got up early to go to visit his mother and woke me up.

01:05:54.314 --> 01:05:56.814
'Well, do not wake Alex.
- It will not go with you?

01:05:56.815 --> 01:05:59.415
-No, he thinks so, but it turned out the
alarm.

01:06:00.316 --> 01:06:03.816
It is easier if you go alone, you know?
-He will be angry.

01:06:05.217 --> 01:06:06.617
-Have a good...

01:06:06.618 --> 01:06:07.818
- Kate Guess what?

01:06:09.019 --> 01:06:11.819
I think it's admirable how calm you are.

01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:16.820
-Y too.

01:06:17.521 --> 01:06:18.221
-Bye.

01:07:10.922 --> 01:07:13.322
-'m Eve, you know I do.

01:07:30.723 --> 01:07:31.923
Hello?

01:07:34.424 --> 01:07:35.424
? Eve?

01:07:44.525 --> 01:07:45.525
? Eve?

01:07:52.226 --> 01:07:53.126
Hello?

01:10:02.327 --> 01:10:03.527
'Hello, baby, tell me.

01:10:03.828 --> 01:10:06.628
- Are Jacob and Amber at home?
- Why? What happens?

01:10:06.629 --> 01:10:09.029
'Go to your room and check
injectables.

01:10:09.030 --> 01:10:10.130
-No, I think they've gone.

01:10:10.131 --> 01:10:11.931
- Go check injectables!

01:10:11.932 --> 01:10:14.332
'Darling what is going on? Is something wrong?
- Go away dammit!

01:10:14.333 --> 01:10:15.533
-Okay, okay, I'm coming.

01:10:41.734 --> 01:10:42.734
SORRY

01:10:43.235 --> 01:10:44.235
Oh my God.

01:12:00.735 --> 01:12:04.935
-You know, what they have done is not unlike
what we have being doing us.

01:12:08.036 --> 01:12:11.836
That nurse basically we sold doses
belonging to others.

01:12:13.137 --> 01:12:15.537
-I have not killed anyone
to get them.

01:12:17.538 --> 01:12:19.238
-Directly no.

01:12:25.739 --> 01:12:30.239
I'm sorry, it was stupid, silly
I said, I did not say that.

01:12:32.240 --> 01:12:33.240
Nena.

01:12:48.041 --> 01:12:50.341
I wish -
corriese time and already out of date.

01:12:52.342 --> 01:12:54.542
- Are you sure that you can see?

01:12:55.543 --> 01:12:57.343
-I expected at nine.

01:12:57.944 --> 01:12:59.544
I said it was important.

01:13:00.145 --> 01:13:01.345
Be there.

01:13:05.846 --> 01:13:07.346
- Are you going to tell?

01:13:09.947 --> 01:13:11.647
'Yes, you may have the solution.

01:13:13.148 --> 01:13:15.848
But to find out I'll have to tell the truth.

01:13:17.949 --> 01:13:18.849
Okay?

01:13:21.850 --> 01:13:22.750
'Okay.

01:13:45.051 --> 01:13:46.051
Jacob!

01:13:46.052 --> 01:13:48.752
Jacob! Thanks, thanks, thanks!

01:13:49.853 --> 01:13:51.653
What the hell is going on?

01:13:51.654 --> 01:13:53.554
-
Not have much time so let me talk okay?.

01:13:53.555 --> 01:13:56.355
- You do not have much time?
Where the fuck are you?

01:13:56.356 --> 01:13:58.156
-You know I can not tell Alex.

01:13:58.157 --> 01:14:01.357
- Do not you? Where the fuck are you?
Have my fucking dose.

01:14:01.758 --> 01:14:04.058
Alex  stop talking or I'll hang up, do you understand me
?

01:14:04.059 --> 01:14:05.859
- Where are you?
- TALKING TO!

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.560
'Okay, okay, talking, TALKING!

01:14:08.861 --> 01:14:10.461
-Amber is not in the room.

01:14:11.562 --> 01:14:14.562
She did not want him to call.
And I promised I would not.

01:14:15.063 --> 01:14:16.563
But I had to talk to you.

01:14:18.864 --> 01:14:21.764
Had been for me,
never have done this.

01:14:21.965 --> 01:14:22.765
But it has been for her.

01:14:23.966 --> 01:14:26.466
I know it's a bitch.
- Bitch? Will I be kidding?

01:14:26.467 --> 01:14:29.067
I get less than 24 hours,
you know what that means?

01:14:29.568 --> 01:14:34.068
-Alex had not choice, it's the greatest shit
I could have done, I know, but I had no choice.

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:38.069
-You had no choice, had it,
Wait! Hear, hear!

01:14:38.070 --> 01:14:39.270
I'm sorry, listen.

01:14:39.771 --> 01:14:41.571
Give me  only six or seven doses okay?

01:14:41.572 --> 01:14:44.872
Do not have to see us,
can leave them somewhere and I gather.

01:14:44.873 --> 01:14:46.173
- How I can do that Alex?

01:14:46.174 --> 01:14:48.174
Why your life is more valuable than
it, eh?

01:14:48.175 --> 01:14:50.475
What makes you so special?
-Jacob, man...

01:14:50.876 --> 01:14:51.476
- What?

01:14:51.477 --> 01:14:53.777
-I do not even have to see me,
-I can not do it.

01:14:53.778 --> 01:14:56.578
-It would pick them up right?
-I can not do it.

01:14:56.579 --> 01:14:59.179
Six or seven doses,
that are six or seven doses of your life.

01:15:00.180 --> 01:15:01.180
-Jacob, please man.

01:15:01.181 --> 01:15:03.181
- What choice do I have? Tell me.

01:15:03.182 --> 01:15:05.182
Dame just a few.
Not yet, not yet...

01:15:05.883 --> 01:15:08.483
I have not yet fired from Kate,
I'm not ready, give me some,

01:15:08.484 --> 01:15:10.284
is all I need, just a few
.

01:15:10.285 --> 01:15:11.385
I can not.

01:15:11.386 --> 01:15:13.386
-Jacob  please.

01:15:14.187 --> 01:15:16.387
Please, I just need some.

01:15:16.988 --> 01:15:19.388
Alex, sorry Alex.

01:15:20.589 --> 01:15:21.089
Goodbye.

01:16:15.890 --> 01:16:19.190
-I have been dismantled, and
have taken all the military hospitals.

01:16:19.591 --> 01:16:21.991
And we have sent to each of us
to a different site.

01:16:21.992 --> 01:16:25.092
I am on dialysis, Lucy in the ER,
and Mary is upstairs with the kids.

01:16:25.393 --> 01:16:26.193
Is a disaster.

01:16:26.994 --> 01:16:28.294
No you will convert.

01:16:29.195 --> 01:16:34.395
David says you might want to change the appointment,
because it will take, surgery was complicated

01:16:45.296 --> 01:16:46.796
-I'll be back in a minute.

01:17:04.497 --> 01:17:07.097
- Will they get that work?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

01:17:07.798 --> 01:17:12.298
The last few days have been working on the new antigens
trying to implant them in,

01:17:12.299 --> 01:17:14.299
-David, do not tell me rolls, when?

01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:17.000
-You should have told Kate.

01:17:18.301 --> 01:17:20.101
- What fell in love with a returnee?

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:23.502
-No, you're so involved in all this
.

01:17:23.903 --> 01:17:25.603
- I expedientasen Why?

01:17:25.804 --> 01:17:29.804
For all cleaning including
bitch could gossip about me?.

01:17:30.105 --> 01:17:32.905
What for?
-In order to save this disaster.

01:17:33.806 --> 01:17:35.506
Now I can not help Kate.

01:17:35.807 --> 01:17:38.607
'Well, I'll have to go to one of those military hospitals
.

01:17:39.008 --> 01:17:40.108
-You arrested.

01:17:41.709 --> 01:17:43.109
-I need injections.

01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:44.110
-There are none.

01:17:44.511 --> 01:17:46.311
And so will catch him.

01:17:46.512 --> 01:17:50.512
- So what do you suggest I do?
Make it stop me seeing him die?

01:17:55.113 --> 01:17:56.113
I'm sorry.

01:17:56.914 --> 01:17:58.314
What you suggest I do?

01:17:59.815 --> 01:18:00.715
Tell me.

01:18:07.116 --> 01:18:08.216
'Come with me.

01:20:00.517 --> 01:20:02.217
-Mother,
Fuck!

01:20:02.818 --> 01:20:06.818
-There for fifty days
hope that this already long before this all figured out.

01:20:06.819 --> 01:20:08.619
'I had no idea.

01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:12.620
-
Each hospital decides where teachers save reagents,

01:20:12.621 --> 01:20:17.421
most prefer that the government has, prevents them problems.

01:20:17.822 --> 01:20:20.422
I have always preferred to stay out of it.

01:20:21.623 --> 01:20:23.623
-Cameras have seen us enter.

01:20:23.824 --> 01:20:25.324
-Yeah, I know.

01:20:27.425 --> 01:20:29.225
I'll think of something.

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:31.726
Anyway I...

01:20:32.727 --> 01:20:35.727
... I've been wanting to retire.

01:20:38.128 --> 01:20:39.128
Thank you.

01:20:58.029 --> 01:21:00.229
- I have them!
- Thank God!

01:21:01.730 --> 01:21:02.530
-Fifty.

01:21:04.831 --> 01:21:06.631
'Wait, wait, how many?

01:21:06.732 --> 01:21:08.232

01:21:10.833 --> 01:21:13.233
'm Coming home, I will give the

01:21:13.434 --> 01:21:15.934
I love you.
-I love you.

01:21:17.635 --> 01:21:19.435
Then see you, bye.

01:21:52.336 --> 01:21:53.436
- Drop it!

01:22:46.237 --> 01:22:47.437
- Oh my god!

01:22:57.438 --> 01:22:58.938
Oh no, shit!

01:23:05.438 --> 01:23:06.438
Oh God no.

Fuck...

01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:46.640
I do not want you to look elsewhere
okay?

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:49.141
... I want you to go.

01:25:50.642 --> 01:25:51.442
No, Kate.

01:25:51.643 --> 01:25:54.143
-I have to try.
No time to talk.

01:25:58.244 --> 01:26:00.244
I can hardly breathe.

01:26:00.745 --> 01:26:03.245
-That still does not mean anything right?

01:26:05.946 --> 01:26:07.246
-Kate, look at me...

01:26:08.247 --> 01:26:11.647

01:26:11.648 --> 01:26:13.648
'I will not leave you alone right?

01:26:13.749 --> 01:26:14.649

'Then promise me one thing.

Not afraid to reach you all night,

-I lost it.
- Shit, I thought you had something happen.

01:31:24.569 --> 01:31:27.369

01:31:30.871 --> 01:31:31.971
- Are you serious?

01:31:32.472 --> 01:31:35.772
With all the fireworks and the ruckus
mounted half the city?

01:31:36.173 --> 01:31:37.373
And yet you have not heard?

01:31:38.374 --> 01:31:39.874
