WEBVTT

00:09.340 --> 00:12.560
Okay. So, you told Gary that his car was getting towed, right?

00:12.770 --> 00:14.500
Yeah. You should have seen his face

00:14.650 --> 00:18.490
when the tow truck pulled up. Priceless.

00:18.980 --> 00:22.370
CeCe! You weren't supposed to really get his car towed.

00:23.100 --> 00:25.610
Good information for 20 minutes ago.

00:30.870 --> 00:32.600
Go DJ   Spin that track

00:32.759 --> 00:34.270

00:41.510 --> 00:42.460
Party ain't done

00:44.210 --> 00:45.750
The night is young  The night is young

00:45.910 --> 00:47.630
When the sun goes down and the kids come out

00:47.790 --> 00:49.590
We're gonna party all night no doubt

00:49.770 --> 00:51.540
Rockin' my stunna shades at night

00:51.680 --> 00:53.450
Up to the a.m.  Sleep in the light

00:53.600 --> 00:55.420
Go, DJ  Spin that track

00:55.560 --> 00:57.270
Scratch it up  Now bring that back

00:57.430 --> 00:59.120
Say this right here  CHORUS:This right here

00:59.300 --> 01:00.990
Is my song  Is my song

01:01.140 --> 01:05.180
'Cause when the lights go down Our day starts

01:06.080 --> 01:09.110
We're super good  We're super superstars

01:09.250 --> 01:11.030
Partying all night

01:11.210 --> 01:13.050
Hands up in the air

01:13.280 --> 01:16.860
After we do the work we social network

01:17.060 --> 01:18.490
Go DJ  Spin that track

01:18.650 --> 01:20.380

01:22.470 --> 01:24.250
Scratch it up  Now bring that back

01:27.410 --> 01:28.730
Party ain't done

01:30.130 --> 01:32.050
The night is young  The night is young

01:38.550 --> 01:42.080
Everybody, everybody,get out on the floor

01:42.280 --> 01:45.760
It can get a little crazy when the kick hits the 4

01:45.930 --> 01:49.590
Make a scene, make a scene,nobody can ignore

01:49.890 --> 01:53.560
Don't knock it  We can't take it no more

01:53.890 --> 01:57.370
Bring the lights up,bust the doors down

01:57.540 --> 02:00.690
Dust yourself off  Shake it up, shake it up

02:00.890 --> 02:05.000
DJ set it off,take it up a notch

02:05.150 --> 02:08.320
All together now,shake it up, shake it up

02:09.139 --> 02:12.980
Sh-sh-sh-shake it up  You got to change it up

02:13.150 --> 02:16.640
And when you've had enough  Sh-sh-sh-shake it up

02:16.810 --> 02:19.790
Bring the lights up,bust the doors down

02:20.020 --> 02:23.290
All together now,shake it up, shake it up

02:26.010 --> 02:28.340
Shake it up

02:28.340 --> 02:29.050
Shake It Up! S02E14 Egg It Up

02:33.920 --> 02:34.910
Class!

02:37.050 --> 02:41.790
When is a science project like a Chinese soup?

02:45.820 --> 02:47.230
When it's an egg drop.

02:50.380 --> 02:54.210
Now, who can tell me what I just demonstrated?

02:56.130 --> 02:58.610
You demonstrated that eggs are fragile?

02:58.750 --> 03:02.680
Wrong. I demonstrated that eggs are fragile.

03:05.400 --> 03:07.710
Mr. Polk, CeCe just said that.

03:07.890 --> 03:08.610
She did?

03:10.990 --> 03:13.230
Well, color me surprised.

03:14.560 --> 03:19.510
Now, you're all gonna get a chance to see exactly how fragile fresh eggs are

03:19.660 --> 03:23.400
because you're going to build something to protect one from breaking

03:23.530 --> 03:27.050
when we drop it off the roof of the school.

03:27.220 --> 03:28.010
Yeah!

03:28.220 --> 03:31.280
There are no rules. Yes, Rocky?

03:32.220 --> 03:35.440
I was just a little confused about what the rules are for the assignment.

03:35.570 --> 03:37.060
I just said there are no rules.

03:37.260 --> 03:39.430
So the rule is we can do whatever we want?

03:40.070 --> 03:42.070
No, I just said there's no rules.

03:42.860 --> 03:45.240
So the rule is there are no rules?

03:45.630 --> 03:46.990
Moving on.

03:49.720 --> 03:51.440
This is a team assignment,

03:51.580 --> 03:56.030
so please check the posted list to see who you will be working with.

04:02.300 --> 04:05.460
Rocky, you are so lucky. You got an awesome partner!

04:05.660 --> 04:06.620
- Really? Who am I with? - Me!

04:06.860 --> 04:10.220
Yay, us! Okay.

04:10.400 --> 04:12.970
All right, I'll catch up with you in a second!

04:13.190 --> 04:14.160
Okay. Okay?

04:17.649 --> 04:20.180
Mr. Polk,

04:20.839 --> 04:25.880
as you know, CeCe and I, we're BFFs

04:26.050 --> 04:27.190
and we're also dance partners...

04:27.340 --> 04:29.420
Rocky, save your breath.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.760
I did not pair the two of you up randomly.

04:31.950 --> 04:34.030
I think it'll be really good for each of you to see

04:34.150 --> 04:36.660
how the other one approaches a problem.

04:36.820 --> 04:40.350
And that's great, but as you're aware,

04:40.520 --> 04:45.510
I have this A average and CeCe's average is just, well,

04:45.700 --> 04:46.810
average.

04:48.170 --> 04:49.180
On a good day.

04:51.030 --> 04:54.540
Just give it a chance. You might be surprised at the outcome.

04:59.760 --> 05:01.240
So, just to clarify, you're saying that

05:01.240 --> 05:03.420
the second rule of this assignment is to keep an open mind?

05:03.620 --> 05:04.630
Goodbye, Rocky!

05:12.990 --> 05:16.750
Oh, hey, did I tell you that the new Rock Legen video game is coming out this week?

05:17.350 --> 05:18.980
Is that right? Yeah.

05:21.270 --> 05:23.820
In fact, all of the rock legends

05:23.980 --> 05:26.270
will be performing in my apartment tomorrow.

05:27.890 --> 05:28.640
That's cool.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.460
Yeah, and guess what. Elton John and my mom really hit it off

05:32.670 --> 05:34.650
and he's going to be my new step-dad.

05:35.910 --> 05:37.800
Sounds good, little man.

05:38.260 --> 05:39.840
No, it sounds ridiculous!

05:40.020 --> 05:43.580
But you're too busy making googly eyes with Miss Teen USA.

05:44.930 --> 05:46.570
You know, when you're babysitting me,

05:46.710 --> 05:50.580
it wouldn't kill you to pay attention to, I don't know, me!

05:52.220 --> 05:53.700
Why don't you take a seat?

05:54.250 --> 05:56.750
Uh, excuse me, this seat is already taken.

06:01.110 --> 06:02.430
One second.

06:07.730 --> 06:11.480
Oh, wow, you can lift 50 pounds! I hope that impresses her.

06:17.830 --> 06:19.480
Hey, hey, hey. I got everything we need

06:19.610 --> 06:21.430
to work on this project together.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.850
And now, we're gonna use this duffel bag

06:29.040 --> 06:31.960
to store everything that could be a distraction to you.

06:39.790 --> 06:40.840
No, no, no, no, no.

06:41.070 --> 06:42.230
Oh, yes.

06:45.280 --> 06:50.000
Okay, fine. But FYI, I already started thinking about the project.

06:50.650 --> 06:52.530
This color is called eggshell.

06:52.760 --> 06:55.510
And this color is called the yolk's on you.

06:57.120 --> 06:58.560
Oh, that's good. Okay, okay.

06:58.750 --> 06:59.540
That was a good one.

07:00.010 --> 07:04.800
But we need to get to work, so let's get cracking.

07:09.040 --> 07:10.690
You're not gonna laugh at my bad egg joke?

07:11.000 --> 07:12.230
'Cause I laughed at yours.

07:14.020 --> 07:16.980
Okay, we need to draw up some blueprints,

07:17.120 --> 07:19.220
create a device to protect the egg from dropping,

07:19.420 --> 07:21.610
and test it and perfect it.

07:22.340 --> 07:26.950
Or, we can relax and let the ideas come to us.

07:27.200 --> 07:28.490
You know, I happen to come up

07:28.630 --> 07:31.150
with some of my best ideas while sleeping.

07:32.020 --> 07:32.840
Come on, CeCe.

07:33.040 --> 07:35.940
Now, you know how important it is for me to get a good grade on this project.

07:36.480 --> 07:39.900
Now, I know Mr. Polk says we have to free our minds and there are no rules,

07:40.050 --> 07:42.490
but at the same time, we need some structure.

07:42.970 --> 07:46.030
So, I've come up with a few guidelines so that we can...CeCe?

07:47.680 --> 07:50.180
CeCe?

07:51.070 --> 07:53.400
All right. It's going in the duffel, too.  Ow!

08:01.700 --> 08:03.880
Come on, Flynn. You're going to be late for school.

08:04.150 --> 08:05.500
Nah, I'm not going with you.

08:05.800 --> 08:09.000
Come on, little man, you know it's my job this week to take you to school

08:09.170 --> 08:10.270
while your mom's working the night shift.

08:10.620 --> 08:12.860
Oh yeah, that reminds me. You're fired!

08:14.580 --> 08:15.330
What?

08:15.700 --> 08:18.430
You're canned. You're terminated.You're eighty-sixed.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.180
The part where you're working here?

08:21.420 --> 08:22.810
That's not happening anymore.

08:24.810 --> 08:25.710
I get it.

08:26.250 --> 08:27.270
This is about the other day

08:27.270 --> 08:29.270
when I didn't listen to you about your video game, huh?

08:30.320 --> 08:32.280
Listen, man, I'm sorry I pushed you aside,

08:32.740 --> 08:34.690
but sometimes when you're around,

08:34.830 --> 08:36.179
it's hard to keep a lady's attention

08:36.590 --> 08:39.289
because you're so gosh darn cute.

08:40.740 --> 08:47.100
Aw. That's some of the best butt-kissing I've heard in a long time.

08:47.290 --> 08:48.920
But too little, too late.

08:49.560 --> 08:51.710
I have someone else who wants to take me to school.

08:51.810 --> 08:52.640
Really? Who?

08:53.700 --> 08:56.040
I'm Gunther! And I'm Flynn!

08:56.320 --> 08:59.210
- And you are unemployed! - And you are unemployed!

09:04.540 --> 09:07.290
So the way I see it is we have to increase the accuracy of the drop,

09:07.550 --> 09:09.350
minimize the weight of the protective device, and...

09:09.560 --> 09:10.870
Run quickly and deny everything!

09:14.720 --> 09:16.800
-What was that all about?  -What was what all about?

09:17.640 --> 09:20.350
Well, I just saw you talking to Jessi and then she ran away.

09:21.570 --> 09:22.710
What were you two talking about?

09:23.850 --> 09:27.700
Uh, Beyonce's new hair color. I love it.

09:29.540 --> 09:30.550
Me, too.

09:31.010 --> 09:32.400
Would you call it a golden honey?

09:32.550 --> 09:35.430
Or is it more of an amber golden with a touch of honey in the highlights?

09:35.750 --> 09:37.470
Uh, the second one?

09:37.640 --> 09:41.450
Ha! Trick question. Beyonce's hair color doesn't have gold in it at all.

09:41.620 --> 09:43.980
It's bronze low-lights with honey amber highlights!

09:44.540 --> 09:46.520
You're up to something and I can tell.

09:46.800 --> 09:50.250
What? What? No!

09:50.520 --> 09:52.520
Really? Then what's this?

09:53.370 --> 09:57.330
Egg Drop Project by Rocky Blue and Jessi... How could you?

09:57.910 --> 10:01.200
No, no, no, no, no. It's not as bad as it looks.

10:01.710 --> 10:04.560
Really? "An Eggsploration of Flight and Fancy."

10:04.750 --> 10:06.540
You even gave it a cute, eggy title.

10:06.710 --> 10:08.300
Okay, but she means nothing to me.

10:08.460 --> 10:10.820
I was only attracted to her for her class ranking.

10:11.030 --> 10:13.610
I can't believe you're cheating on me behind my back.

10:14.110 --> 10:15.890
And to do it in front of my own locker?

10:16.100 --> 10:17.030
Have you no shame?

10:17.460 --> 10:21.150
Okay. It's not as bad as it sounds.

10:21.460 --> 10:23.300
It makes sense to trade.

10:23.490 --> 10:25.830
You and Jessi's partner have a lot in common.

10:26.090 --> 10:27.770
You both approach school the same way.

10:32.640 --> 10:33.860
Not cool.

10:40.950 --> 10:44.260
Okay, it was wrong to go behind your back and try to switch partners.

10:44.610 --> 10:45.390
I should have come to you first.

10:45.890 --> 10:48.550
Um, excuse me. Is this stage haunted?

10:48.710 --> 10:51.220
Because I thought I heard my friend Rocky's voice,

10:51.540 --> 10:54.370
but that's impossible because she's dead to me.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.710
At least we're making progress.

10:57.870 --> 10:59.780
You did say, "My friend, Rocky."

11:01.070 --> 11:04.250
Oh, come on. Okay, you know what? I'm gonna make it up to you.

11:04.420 --> 11:05.810
I'll do the whole project by myself

11:05.970 --> 11:07.290
and you can put your name on it.

11:07.550 --> 11:08.330
Ta-done!

11:09.620 --> 11:11.420
Okay, I know you think you're doing me a favor,

11:11.590 --> 11:12.900
but that hurts my feelings.

11:13.080 --> 11:14.630
Ow! And that hurts my rear end!

11:16.420 --> 11:18.270
Okay, what is the big deal?

11:18.660 --> 11:20.550
We'll both get an A on the project,

11:20.840 --> 11:22.420
and besides, it's the least I can do.

11:22.690 --> 11:25.600
The least you can do to get an A for yourself, you mean.

11:25.970 --> 11:28.210
Your offer is just you protecting your own grade.

11:28.360 --> 11:30.620
And clearly, you think I'll just drag you down.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.390
You are blowing this way out of proportion.

11:33.650 --> 11:38.000
You know, sometimes you can be a real pain in the...Ow! Neck.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.790
You know what? Now I don't want to work with you.

11:42.380 --> 11:43.430
I'm going to tell Mr. Polk

11:43.750 --> 11:45.390
that we both decided we'd rather work alone.

11:45.630 --> 11:48.310
And don't be surprised if you're not the only one who gets an A.

11:48.940 --> 11:51.250
Now,if you'll excuse me, I'm out of here.

11:57.850 --> 12:00.470
That's right. You heard me. I'm out of here!

12:01.850 --> 12:03.600
Still out of here!

12:04.410 --> 12:06.510
CeCe, the dressing rooms are that way.  Right.

12:14.290 --> 12:16.530
Hey, little man,guess who called in a favor with Deuce

12:16.700 --> 12:19.400
and got the Rock Legends video game a day before it hits the stores?

12:19.590 --> 12:21.850
That's right.You ready to rock and... What the...

12:23.680 --> 12:26.580
Make fun all you want, but when I told Gunther about the game, he said...

12:26.720 --> 12:30.010
Why play Rock Legends when you can dress like rock legends

12:30.180 --> 12:33.090
while eating a nutritious yet scrumptious after-school snack?

12:35.310 --> 12:38.710
Carrots and hummus never tasted so head-bangin' good!

12:40.860 --> 12:43.400
I'm teaching him all about all the major legends of rock and roll.

12:43.910 --> 12:45.220
You should have seen this little popover

12:45.360 --> 12:47.190
with his Elvis sideburns an hour ago.

12:48.370 --> 12:50.100
Thank you, thank you very much.

12:50.620 --> 12:52.140
Okay, I've had enough.

12:52.420 --> 12:55.090
Hey, man, thanks for helping out, or whatever this is,

12:55.580 --> 12:57.100
but I'll take it from here.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.290
Why don't we let the baby orange slice make the decision?

13:03.090 --> 13:05.870
You're the baby orange slice.

13:06.780 --> 13:08.630
Oh, gosh, this is so hard. Don't make me choose.

13:08.830 --> 13:10.340
I just can't...Gunther.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.730
Hey, hey, hey! I thought maybe

13:20.010 --> 13:22.060
you could use a little help finishing up your project.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.710
Well, you thought wrong, because I'm done.

13:25.610 --> 13:28.900
You are? Seriously?

13:30.190 --> 13:32.850
Yeah. Why are you so surprised?

13:33.460 --> 13:36.060
Well, because the project's not due for another 17 hours,

13:36.270 --> 13:39.040
which is typically 16 hours and 45 minutes before you start.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.540
Come on, I'm just kidding.

13:42.930 --> 13:44.990
Okay,I came down here offering my help

13:45.170 --> 13:46.880
because I felt bad.I'm sorry.

13:48.730 --> 13:49.940
So you're apologizing

13:50.170 --> 13:51.990
by not believing I can do this project

13:52.130 --> 13:54.710
by showing up here and still not believing I can do it?

13:56.960 --> 13:58.800
I still don't believe that's an apology.

14:00.760 --> 14:02.260
Okay, Cece, you're acting like I'm nuts

14:02.470 --> 14:03.620
to think you didn't do your homework.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.220
You never do your homework.

14:07.430 --> 14:09.120
Well, I did do it.

14:09.350 --> 14:13.480
And what I did was, by the way, pretty fabulous.

14:15.160 --> 14:16.870
Really? Well, let's take a look.

14:17.270 --> 14:19.940
Why, so you can copy it? I don't think so.

14:20.710 --> 14:22.350
Fine, I guess I'll just see you tomorrow.

14:22.400 --> 14:23.300
All right, I guess you will.

14:23.300 --> 14:24.620
All right, then. Have fun.

14:25.420 --> 14:26.830
- Bye! - Have fun!

14:29.710 --> 14:32.400
Man, I really have to get started on that project!

14:39.650 --> 14:41.000
Hey, little man.

14:41.780 --> 14:42.920
Oh, hello,

14:43.820 --> 14:45.200
Ty.

14:47.270 --> 14:48.970
Oh, man, that's cold.

14:49.790 --> 14:52.490
But okay. I guess you'd rather dress

14:53.120 --> 14:54.230
like a rock legend with Gunther

14:54.540 --> 14:59.910
than be a rock legend with me.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.320
Whoa! That's the coolest thing I've ever seen!

15:04.640 --> 15:06.190
Oh, you rock, Ty!

15:06.660 --> 15:09.590
No, little man, it's you who can now rock!

15:11.000 --> 15:17.074

15:19.540 --> 15:22.010
Sounding good, my little drummer boy!

15:23.110 --> 15:24.570
But we don't want to be late.

15:24.950 --> 15:26.590
I've arranged for you to take singing lessons from...

15:26.770 --> 15:28.980
Drum roll, please.

15:29.410 --> 15:30.750
The Usher!

15:31.990 --> 15:33.750
Oh, yeah? Yeah? Well, after drumming,

15:34.120 --> 15:36.110
I was going to take him for chili cheese burgers.

15:36.470 --> 15:38.380
I was going to take him for chili cheese burgers, too.

15:38.690 --> 15:40.710
And whatever else you might say, but double!

15:42.380 --> 15:45.430
Wow, guys, both of your offers sound very enticing,

15:45.930 --> 15:50.390
but unfortunately, I haven't started my "Who's My Hero?" essay

15:50.730 --> 15:52.910
and it's due tomorrow,so, unless I had some help...

15:53.100 --> 15:54.440
No, no. I'll write it for you.

15:54.760 --> 15:55.800
I already have the perfect title.

15:56.340 --> 15:59.600
"My Hero, Ty Blue" by Flynn Jones. Here we go.

16:00.970 --> 16:04.010
You think I'm gonna stand here and let you write lies?

16:04.560 --> 16:05.690
The title of Flynn's essay is

16:06.200 --> 16:09.320
"Oh, Captain,My Captain: My Hero,Gunther Hessenheffer."

16:10.570 --> 16:12.790
Whatever you two decide, I'm fine with.

16:13.050 --> 16:14.920
I'll see you guys later, I'm meeting up with Henry.

16:17.570 --> 16:18.860
Wait a minute.

16:19.430 --> 16:22.760
We're writing his essay while he hangs out with his friend?

16:23.490 --> 16:26.220
He's been playing us against each other this whole time.

16:27.490 --> 16:28.870
You're right.

16:29.570 --> 16:31.820
Clearly, we have been bamboozled.

16:32.850 --> 16:34.550
Maybe it's time for the bamboozled

16:34.730 --> 16:36.990
to do a little bamboozling back to the bamboozler

16:37.160 --> 16:40.180
to see if the bamboozler likes getting bamboozled!

16:42.110 --> 16:43.270
Well, one thing's for sure,

16:43.910 --> 16:45.500
we are not going to finish this essay.

16:45.900 --> 16:46.910
Oh. Oh, yes.

16:47.230 --> 16:48.860
Yes, we are.

17:01.290 --> 17:04.200
All right, the assignment was to protect the egg.

17:07.480 --> 17:09.470
Mr. Johnson and Mr. Murphy,

17:10.150 --> 17:12.000
if you were you going for scrambled eggs,

17:12.380 --> 17:14.750
bravo.

17:18.089 --> 17:20.599
CeCe, it's not too late for you to put your name on my project.

17:20.910 --> 17:22.410
And it's not too late for you to put yours on mine.

17:22.530 --> 17:23.349
-I'm good.   -Me, too.

17:24.260 --> 17:27.510
Okay, send down Rocky Blue's.

17:35.060 --> 17:36.620
What!  No! No! No! No!

17:37.010 --> 17:38.170
According to my calculations,

17:38.430 --> 17:39.630
that egg should not have just broken.

17:39.900 --> 17:42.230
They threw it off the roof wrong. Do over! Do over!

17:44.040 --> 17:45.800
Your egg, my spirit.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.180
Things break, Miss Blue.

17:50.540 --> 17:52.340
All right. And last, but never least.

17:53.520 --> 17:57.370
Show me CeCe Jones!

18:15.850 --> 18:18.740
Miss Jones, this is absolutely brilliant.

18:18.950 --> 18:23.490
It's simple, creative and outright genius.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.330
And, since yours is the only egg that didn't break,

18:26.670 --> 18:28.120
you get an A+.

18:28.570 --> 18:30.460
That's not fair! I should at least get a...

18:30.830 --> 18:32.740
Wait, what? A+.

18:33.630 --> 18:36.920
Mr. Polk, will you do me a favor and call my mom?

18:37.090 --> 18:39.260
Because if I tell her,she's never going to believe it.

18:40.060 --> 18:41.090
All right. 3-1-2...

18:41.270 --> 18:42.950
Nah, it's all right.I got it on speed dial.

18:47.150 --> 18:49.460
Okay, class, quiet down.

18:49.810 --> 18:53.110
Now, I've read all your hero essays, and they were terrific.

18:53.900 --> 18:56.550
But there was one that really stood out.

18:57.290 --> 18:58.680
Flynn Jones.

18:59.870 --> 19:01.110
Oh, thanks, Miss Andrews.

19:02.800 --> 19:06.420
I thought it was very, very brave.

19:07.100 --> 19:07.830
You did?

19:10.080 --> 19:12.120
Yes, and I'd like you to come up here

19:12.350 --> 19:14.650
and read your essay in front of the class.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.270
Okay.

19:22.150 --> 19:24.830
"Me and My Awesome Hero, by Flynn Jones."

19:25.820 --> 19:27.220
Well, so far so good.

19:29.270 --> 19:31.200
"My hero is not only my best friend.

19:32.150 --> 19:33.370
"He is also my protector,

19:34.470 --> 19:35.540
"which is good,

19:36.010 --> 19:37.960
"because I'm scared of a lot of things.

19:38.700 --> 19:39.700
"Like the dark."

19:41.340 --> 19:42.780
Please continue, Flynn.

19:44.080 --> 19:45.970
"And being eaten by the toilet."

19:47.510 --> 19:48.460
Shh!

19:49.210 --> 19:51.180
Go on, you brave, young man.

19:52.450 --> 19:53.670
Do I have to?

19:56.060 --> 19:58.690
"That's why my hero is my teddy bear,

19:59.530 --> 20:00.460
"Mr. Wubby.

20:02.530 --> 20:04.420
"Mr. Wubby is not only the softest

20:04.670 --> 20:06.490
"and most cuddly friend a boy can have,

20:07.450 --> 20:08.370
"he's also

20:09.160 --> 20:10.390
"a great kisser.

20:12.740 --> 20:14.570
"That's right, I dress him up

20:14.780 --> 20:17.120
"and pretend he's the prettiest girl in class,

20:18.510 --> 20:19.450
"Linda Lazo,

20:20.130 --> 20:23.120
"who I am desperately in love with."

20:39.660 --> 20:40.790
Hey, CeCe.

20:41.540 --> 20:44.040
Guess who has egg on her face.

20:45.940 --> 20:46.890
Me.

20:49.900 --> 20:52.430
Rocky, it's fine.You don't have to...

20:52.760 --> 20:55.090
No, no! No.I owe you an apology.

20:55.580 --> 20:57.670
I should have never underestimated you.I'm sorry.

20:58.960 --> 21:01.260
You're a lot smarter than people give you credit for,

21:02.410 --> 21:03.570
including me.

21:05.640 --> 21:06.920
Thanks for saying that, Rock.

21:07.980 --> 21:11.040
But it's not like I came up with some brilliant idea.

21:11.830 --> 21:13.400
I kind of just got lucky at the last minute.

21:18.000 --> 21:20.050
Oh, who am I kidding?  I got nothing.

21:20.610 --> 21:23.160
I gotta eat breakfast.Why fail on an empty stomach?

21:36.150 --> 21:37.840
Oh, forget it.I'll just eat a banana.

21:38.470 --> 21:39.250
Wait a minute.

21:41.290 --> 21:43.270
Like I said, if I hadn't dropped this jar...

21:43.730 --> 21:46.120
No.No, no, no. Don't sell yourself short.

21:46.310 --> 21:47.930
You're the one who thought of putting the egg in there.

21:48.980 --> 21:51.960
Some of science's greatest discoveries happened by accident.

21:52.270 --> 21:54.320
Like Sir Isaac Newton, his greatest discovery

21:54.520 --> 21:56.820
happened after an apple fell on his head while he was sleeping.

21:57.890 --> 22:01.250
Whoa, I never knew that's how the fig newton was discovered.

22:03.030 --> 22:04.000
Yep, CeCe,it sure was.

22:07.890 --> 22:09.840
Good afternoon, Chicago!

22:10.370 --> 22:12.280
We are Smooch!

22:12.480 --> 22:13.990
Are you ready to rock?

22:15.830 --> 22:16.870
I don't hear you!

22:18.970 --> 22:20.840
I still don't hear you!

22:22.260 --> 22:24.180
But we're going to start anyway.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.630
One, two, three, four!

22:26.800 --> 22:29.620
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes

22:29.850 --> 22:32.660
When she comes

22:32.840 --> 22:35.190
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes

22:35.460 --> 22:38.250
When she comes

22:38.590 --> 22:41.540
She'll be coming round the mountain

22:41.930 --> 22:44.450
She'll be coming round the mountain

22:45.010 --> 22:47.650
She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes

22:47.880 --> 22:50.920
When she comes!
