all right?

28:26.363 --> 28:27.705
Yeah.

28:27.798 --> 28:29.345
Did you see that?

28:29.466 --> 28:30.615
See what?

28:30.701 --> 28:32.487
The creature.
That green thing.

28:32.603 --> 28:35.549
lt came out of nowhere
and it went after those
looters.

28:35.672 --> 28:36.900
Huh. Did it hurt anyone?

28:37.007 --> 28:38.952
Uh-uh.
They all got away.

28:39.042 --> 28:41.112
Boy, there's no telling
how many people they
could infect.

28:41.211 --> 28:42.360
We don't have
much time, do we?

Except it's not
the flu, is it?

right out of college.

29:18.048 --> 29:20.357
l had an MA in
business administration.

29:21.251 --> 29:24.596
He promised me l could
climb the corporate
ladder right to the top.

29:24.688 --> 29:27.191
l got as far as his
outside office.

29:39.770 --> 29:43.763
l was such a good girl.
Never complained,
never rocked the boat.

29:43.874 --> 29:45.865
Oh, l bet that
didn't last.

29:45.976 --> 29:48.524
Not when l found out
what he was up to.

29:48.612 --> 29:51.080
Cunningham told me
he liked my spirit.

29:51.181 --> 29:53.206
He offered to make me
an executive assistant.

All right, we've got
to take him with us.

30:47.204 --> 30:49.149
The Gentamicin
might help.

He still has a chance
and so have we. Come on.

PATTY: Okay.

32:45.956 --> 32:48.459
Don't leave anything
that could be biopsied.

32:48.558 --> 32:51.186
The EPA's sure to find
traces of the bacteria.

32:51.294 --> 32:53.239
Well, R-6 has a
life of 48 hours.

32:53.330 --> 32:55.719
By the time their
federal team gets here,

picks up any specimens
that are left and gets
them back to the lab,

32:58.468 --> 33:00.459
there won't be
any R-6 to find.

33:00.570 --> 33:02.390
They're gonna be looking
for chlorine, anyway.

33:02.506 --> 33:04.292
We spread enough
of that stuff around

33:04.408 --> 33:07.275
to explain any rodent or
bird that we've overlooked.

33:16.286 --> 33:18.390

that antibiotic?

No. No BBK9.

David.

33:22.526 --> 33:23.595
Yeah.

33:32.035 --> 33:36.108
All right. There's Gentamicin.
lt's not a cure,
but it may give us some time.

33:38.108 --> 33:39.257
How long?

33:39.976 --> 33:41.204
An hour.

33:41.645 --> 33:42.873
Maybe less.

34:35.699 --> 34:39.168
All right, let's get them
out of here and put them
in the back of the van.

34:46.510 --> 34:48.011
l'm sorry, David.

34:48.344 --> 34:49.812
What did you do now?

34:50.780 --> 34:52.771
For being so
suspicious of you.

34:53.516 --> 34:54.859
That's understandable.
