00:07.591 --> 00:09.138
Once upon a time in France,

00:09.301 --> 00:12.020
there lived a bad boy
named Christopher Tracy.

00:12.304 --> 00:15.308
Only one thing mattered
to Christopher. Money.

00:16.140 --> 00:19.645
The women he knew
came in all sizes, shapes, and colors,

00:19.811 --> 00:22.655
and they were all rich. Very rich.

00:23.398 --> 00:27.119
Private concertos, kind words, and fun
is what he had to offer them.

00:27.402 --> 00:31.623
Yes, Christopher lived for all women,
but he died for one.

00:32.573 --> 00:36.499
Somewhere along the way,
he learned the true meaning of love.

00:39.414 --> 00:42.213
- The more you drink, the better I sound.
- Psst!

03:35.799 --> 03:37.301
Monsieur.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.010
With the compliments of the lady in white.

07:14.684 --> 07:16.937
When are y'all going to get a job?

07:17.312 --> 07:21.237
Here. I got a job.
Why don't you all get a job?

07:21.858 --> 07:24.611
It's dishonest work, but it's a living.

07:43.672 --> 07:46.040
- Undecided?
- Oui.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.137
- Un, un, un.
- Okay.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.860
- What's up?
- Bonjour, Christopher.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.027
Monsieur.

08:13.785 --> 08:15.913
Mirror, mirror, 17-fold...

08:16.913 --> 08:19.632
Who's the sexiest dressed in gold?

08:19.791 --> 08:22.510
You must be talking about me, cousin.

08:23.211 --> 08:24.929
Smile, Katy, you're naked.

08:26.798 --> 08:31.474
I'll smile when you pay me
the two months' rent you owe me. Hmm?

08:33.179 --> 08:37.934
Okay, you two, don't try anything funny.
Not this time, Christopher.

08:38.101 --> 08:42.025
I want the money or I'll throw you both
out onto the street.

08:42.981 --> 08:46.155
Please, madam,
look at these poor, innocent faces.

08:46.317 --> 08:49.070
These mean streets are no place
for a couple of fine, decent...

08:49.237 --> 08:50.284
Hoodlums like us.

08:50.447 --> 08:52.541
Please, Katy, search in your heart
for some kindness.

08:52.699 --> 08:56.169
Why don't you try searching
in your wallet for some money?

09:00.749 --> 09:03.548
That's right, cousin.
Give her that Bela Lugosi look.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.677
Throw me onto the street, hmm?

09:09.883 --> 09:11.885
Yeah, there.

09:12.218 --> 09:15.347
Perhaps madame would like to
conduct a search.

09:17.348 --> 09:18.600
Hmm.

09:18.892 --> 09:21.111
I wonder where that came from.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.493
Fascist.

09:32.906 --> 09:35.079
How much is lady in white worth?

09:35.241 --> 09:38.245
$3 million.
Got it in her divorce settlement.

09:38.411 --> 09:41.005
I'll settle for that.
We going to marry her?

09:41.831 --> 09:44.550
Ain't it about time
we go for the big macaroni?

09:44.709 --> 09:49.089
Mmm, I like her, but I'm looking
for a bigger brand of macaroni.

09:49.255 --> 09:52.850
Take a look at this
and see if it whets your appetite.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.353
Mary Sharon.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.890
Her father owns half the ships
on the Mediterranean.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.184
He's got to be worth a billion, easy.

10:00.350 --> 10:03.149
He kicked a billion asses to get it, too.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.109
And that says what?

10:05.480 --> 10:09.235
That says she gets a $50 million
trust fund when she turns 21.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.448
- Which is today.
- No.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.914
- Let's go.
- You going to marry her?

10:18.409 --> 10:21.629
Mmm. For $50 million
I would seriously consider it.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.462
But guess what. I take 30% commission.

10:28.336 --> 10:29.462
Yes?

10:30.255 --> 10:33.600
Mary Sharon.
I wonder what tune she'd dance to.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.226
Just one moment. I'll see.

10:35.385 --> 10:38.104
- Mrs. Wellington.
- The lady in white.

10:38.555 --> 10:41.354
Mrs. Wellington, he'll be right with you.

10:41.724 --> 10:43.351
By the way, my name is Tricky.

10:43.518 --> 10:45.270
Tricky, put the phone down.

10:47.856 --> 10:50.279
I never dance before midnight.

10:50.859 --> 10:52.736
But if you insist...

11:02.704 --> 11:05.457
What? Right now?

11:07.333 --> 11:09.461
I mean, here on the phone?

11:11.379 --> 11:14.599
All right. As you wish. Hold on.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.729
Uh-oh. Here we go.

11:30.398 --> 11:33.151
I am nothing without your touch, my love

11:33.318 --> 11:35.616
I am nothing without your kiss

11:36.571 --> 11:39.575
To spend each night
in your arms, my flower

11:39.866 --> 11:41.994
Is this man's idea of bliss

11:42.994 --> 11:44.587
To not hear your voice each day

11:44.746 --> 11:47.625
Is to die seven times by God's wrath

11:49.584 --> 11:52.133
If I was anything other than human

11:52.337 --> 11:55.056
I'd want to be the water in your bath

11:56.758 --> 12:00.353
Till then, my love, ciao.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.652
Who's your agent, man?

12:59.320 --> 13:04.413
Can you believe Isaac Sharon threw
a party long-distance for his daughter?

13:04.575 --> 13:06.703
And didn't even bother to come.

13:06.869 --> 13:08.041
Quel scandale.

13:08.204 --> 13:11.083
He's probably too busy
bribing another government official.

13:11.249 --> 13:14.302
Johnny, you can be so catty sometimes.

13:14.768 --> 13:16.717
And I wasn't even trying.

13:17.839 --> 13:20.183
- Shall we follow the animals?
- Yes.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.116
I need an old man with money.

13:37.525 --> 13:40.153
Who needs money when you've got youth?

14:02.425 --> 14:04.553
Muriel, where is your daughter?

14:04.719 --> 14:07.472
Oh, she'll be down in a second, hopefully.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.354
- Atta girl, Mary.
- Go, Mary, go.

14:26.032 --> 14:28.160
How do you like my birthday suit?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.420
I designed it myself.

14:32.306 --> 14:33.848
Mary!

14:35.056 --> 14:36.801
Madame.

14:39.962 --> 14:41.635
Mrs. Cartwright.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.850
Mary! Mary!

14:49.514 --> 14:50.640
Hello.

14:50.973 --> 14:52.850
How lovely to see you.

14:53.417 --> 14:54.919
I'm so sorry.

15:01.943 --> 15:05.698
All right. Let's get this party rocking!

16:23.065 --> 16:26.035
- You were incredible! Great!
- Amazing!

16:26.277 --> 16:27.324
Thank you.

16:27.570 --> 16:31.200
I'll be back for an encore
just as soon as I've changed my costume.

16:32.450 --> 16:36.455
See that guy who just came in?
Keep an eye on him.

16:38.581 --> 16:40.128
What did she say?

16:40.541 --> 16:42.134
She said...

17:24.919 --> 17:27.547
Looks like it's diamond-hunting season
on the Riviera.

17:27.713 --> 17:30.216
He's already checked out
every woman here twice.

17:30.383 --> 17:33.808
- What about the other one?
- They're a couple of real pros.

17:34.512 --> 17:35.764
Ah. We'll see about that.

17:35.930 --> 17:37.907
What is she doing?

17:44.647 --> 17:48.072
- Happy birthday, Mary.
- Thank you, Mrs. Wellington.

17:58.786 --> 18:00.333
Happy birthday, Mary.

18:01.122 --> 18:04.752
Mary, honey, there you are.
I thought you'd never show up.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.137
I was waiting for the guards
to shoot all the party crashers

18:08.296 --> 18:09.513
before I came down.

18:09.672 --> 18:12.300
It's nice to see you. You look very good.

18:12.466 --> 18:13.683
Thank you.

18:13.843 --> 18:16.187
- What do they call you?
- Tricky.

18:17.096 --> 18:20.475
- Fits you like a glove.
- Just like your wonderful dress.

18:22.059 --> 18:23.606
Good evening.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.515
Nice toss.

18:53.382 --> 18:54.929
And nice party.

18:55.718 --> 18:58.767
Yes. Pity you weren't invited.

19:01.098 --> 19:04.477
- I was in the neighborhood, and, uh...
- And you got lost.

19:06.854 --> 19:09.198
And I thought this would be fun.

19:13.110 --> 19:16.080
Thanks for the present.
Awfully sweet of you.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.836
Aw, tarot cards.
Want me to read your fortune?

19:23.287 --> 19:26.382
I bet you'd like to do a lot more
than read it, buddy.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.170
The name's Christopher, buddy.

19:32.505 --> 19:34.928
I always thought
these things were baloney.

19:35.091 --> 19:38.311
Just tell people what they want to hear
and they're happy.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.774
Would you like to meet my mother?

20:01.242 --> 20:03.540
Mommy, dear, Mrs. Wellington,

20:04.036 --> 20:06.789
I'd like you to meet
my new friend, Christopher, um...

20:08.749 --> 20:10.547
- Madam.
- Christopher.

20:12.002 --> 20:14.221
He's dying to tell you
all about yourselves

20:14.380 --> 20:17.725
with these beautiful tarot cards
you gave me, Mrs. Wellington.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.726
Uh, do you do this professionally,
Christopher?

20:19.885 --> 20:23.606
Madam, I do nothing professionally.
I only do things for fun.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.149
Children, please.

20:30.062 --> 20:32.156
Conga line, baby. Let's go.

20:46.704 --> 20:48.798
Jonathan's on the phone for you.

20:48.956 --> 20:51.505
He says it's totally boring in New York.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.136
No new clubs, no openings, no parties.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.969
He could've come to mine.
I don't want to talk to him.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.008
- Oh, come on, Mary.
- Don't be a dork.

20:59.175 --> 21:01.849
Think about your trust fund.
Come on, darling.

21:27.995 --> 21:29.588
Hello, Jonathan.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.186
That was wonderful, darling.

21:51.519 --> 21:53.738
Billy Eckstine he ain't, baby.

21:55.481 --> 21:58.735
Don't call me baby.
And get out of my house, you creep.

21:58.901 --> 22:01.905
Mary, honey, I didn't call you baby.

22:02.071 --> 22:03.243
And I'm in New York.

22:03.405 --> 22:07.376
And for God's sake, I sincerely hope
you don't think I'm a creep.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.207
I was talking to myself, Jonathan.

22:09.370 --> 22:11.748
That's what insane people do, dear.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.716
You shouldn't spend so much time
by yourself.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.252
Tell Jonathan I said hello.

22:16.418 --> 22:20.673
If you don't get out of my house,
I'll have my father's guards throw you out.

22:22.424 --> 22:24.722
Why, 'cause you ain't bad enough
to do it yourself?

22:25.135 --> 22:28.103
- Will you leave me alone!
- No, I will not.

22:28.556 --> 22:29.853
Listen to me.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.938
I'm coming to France in a few days.

22:32.101 --> 22:35.196
Your father has graciously given me
a week off.

22:35.396 --> 22:37.694
Oh. That's lovely, Jonathan.

22:37.857 --> 22:41.407
I'm sure you and Daddy
will have lots of business to talk about.

22:44.196 --> 22:46.198
I bet he's your boyfriend.

22:47.700 --> 22:50.374
It may seem strange to a hustler like you

22:50.536 --> 22:54.336
but I happen to go out
with people my own age. Special people.

22:54.498 --> 22:57.422
And they don't wear wedding rings either.

22:57.626 --> 23:00.049
Then they must be wearing diapers!

23:01.046 --> 23:04.141
Here's your future, framed in gold.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.063
Pits!

23:32.202 --> 23:34.204
- How are you doing?
- Cool. How you doing?

23:34.371 --> 23:37.341
Man, forget it.
This girl ain't got no home training.

23:38.292 --> 23:42.047
Remove this peasant from my party.
Take his friend, too.

23:42.379 --> 23:44.507
I'm having trouble breathing.

23:45.758 --> 23:49.934
Maybe if you took off your chastity belt
you could breathe a little more better.

23:51.722 --> 23:53.065
How dare you?

23:53.223 --> 23:56.147
When my ship comes in,
I'll never treat people like that.

23:56.310 --> 23:57.857
You couldn't afford a ship.

23:58.020 --> 24:00.648
- How much money you make?
- 3,000 francs a week.

24:00.814 --> 24:03.112
Damn! Couldn't you buy some cologne?

24:08.280 --> 24:11.375
Punk! Come on back here! One, two, three!

24:11.533 --> 24:12.785
Punk, punk, punk!

24:12.952 --> 24:16.456
Come on back here and fight!
Come on. Uh-huh. Get some of this.

24:20.125 --> 24:21.422
Come on back and fight.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.964
You scared to come back. I'll put this
cute little shoe in your ugly...

24:25.130 --> 24:27.053
- Tricky.
- What do you want?

24:27.216 --> 24:28.308
Come here.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.303
Can you get home all right?

24:35.933 --> 24:38.903
- Hi, Brisby, remember me?
- Good evening, sir.

24:41.981 --> 24:45.196
You know who you've dialed.
She's not home.

24:45.818 --> 24:48.116
Do you want to leave a message?

24:48.320 --> 24:52.245
Hello, beautiful, this is Isaac.
I'll be home in the morning.

24:55.494 --> 24:59.849
I called you five times last night.
Now, where were you?

24:59.999 --> 25:01.251
With me.

25:01.875 --> 25:04.094
I hate this damn machine.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.345
Me, too.

25:07.756 --> 25:09.804
You're not there, are you? Hmm?

25:11.427 --> 25:15.432
You aren't seeing another man,
by any chance?

25:15.597 --> 25:16.689
Yes.

25:17.182 --> 25:21.028
Because if you are, I'll kill him.

25:23.605 --> 25:25.528
You know I love you, darling.

25:27.401 --> 25:29.495
See you. Bye.

25:29.862 --> 25:31.114
Goodbye.

25:35.492 --> 25:38.336
He's a little possessive, don't you think?

25:40.039 --> 25:43.714
He likes to collect things,
including people.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.382
You must be his prized possession.

25:52.843 --> 25:55.462
Oh, I'm like you, Christopher. Hmm?

25:58.265 --> 26:00.643
- I like to have fun.
- Fun.

26:01.727 --> 26:04.071
- Now, there's a wonderful word.
- Hmm.

26:16.617 --> 26:21.088
Maybe if you took off your jockstrap
you would be able to breathe easier, hmm?

26:22.081 --> 26:24.049
I should have said that.

26:27.961 --> 26:29.759
I should have said,

26:30.422 --> 26:34.518
"Chastity belt?
Oh, you're sadly mistaken, sir.

26:34.927 --> 26:38.682
"I wear a cestus.
Perhaps you've heard of it?

26:39.306 --> 26:43.436
"It's an embroidered girdle
originally worn by Venus,

26:43.602 --> 26:45.525
"and it inspires love.

26:45.979 --> 26:49.700
"Perhaps you've heard of love.
I doubt it."

26:54.738 --> 26:56.490
He's just a peasant.

26:58.784 --> 27:01.253
He doesn't even know who Venus is.

27:05.415 --> 27:06.917
Hello, kitten.

27:07.584 --> 27:11.464
How is the prettiest girl
on the Côte d'Azur?

27:12.464 --> 27:13.681
Terrific.

27:13.841 --> 27:17.061
- I'm sorry I missed your party last night.
- But you had to see to the ship.

27:17.219 --> 27:19.062
I said I'm sorry, darling.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.815
Somebody has to go out
and earn the pennies.

27:21.974 --> 27:23.317
It's forgiven.

27:23.767 --> 27:27.647
- Would you like to tell me about it?
- Can't it wait till later?

27:28.272 --> 27:32.698
- You will be home for dinner, won't you?
- Unfortunately, not tonight.

27:33.152 --> 27:34.825
I have an appointment at 7:00,

27:34.987 --> 27:38.241
but I'm sure your mother
will tell me everything.

27:38.490 --> 27:39.662
Right.

27:41.076 --> 27:43.955
Won't you let the dog loose.
She seems awfully hungry.

28:05.017 --> 28:07.645
- Tricky, no.
- Oh, thank you. Bye-bye.

28:12.608 --> 28:14.360
Good evening, Chris.

28:15.861 --> 28:16.987
Oh, yeah.

28:24.745 --> 28:28.124
Good evening, ladies.
Tricky's the name, and love is my game.

28:28.415 --> 28:31.589
You ain't got no money,
I love you just the same.

29:06.912 --> 29:09.836
You know, I could breathe a lot easier

29:09.998 --> 29:13.923
if the air weren't so utterly polluted
by your presence.

29:14.670 --> 29:15.842
Oh.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.719
You've been rehearsing that line
all night, haven't you?

29:23.553 --> 29:26.227
I have a message for you
from Mrs. Wellington.

29:26.515 --> 29:29.769
She wants you to come to her house
tonight at 7:00.

29:30.018 --> 29:33.989
- Want to dance?
- I never dance with my clothes on.

29:34.273 --> 29:35.525
I noticed.

29:35.899 --> 29:37.025
Mary!

29:39.275 --> 29:40.504
Mary.

29:40.654 --> 29:42.827
The name drips from one's lips.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.492
You look wonderful tonight,

29:44.658 --> 29:47.457
and I'd be very honored
if you'd dance with me.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.291
At least someone around here
has some manners.

30:00.299 --> 30:04.304
Mary, tell me,
is it really true you're engaged?

30:04.553 --> 30:05.679
Yes.

30:06.680 --> 30:11.311
Tsk, tsk, what a pity.
Sometimes life can be so shitty.

30:11.852 --> 30:15.152
- Here's a girl, she's smart and pretty.
- And rich.

30:15.314 --> 30:19.114
I don't care about that!
Honey, I really don't.

30:20.277 --> 30:25.033
I want a girl who can teach me things,
hip me to the finer side of life.

30:25.198 --> 30:28.748
Who's not stupid.
Man, I hate stupid girls.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.423
Marry a stupid girl, you have stupid kids.
You don't believe me?

30:33.582 --> 30:35.004
Follow a stupid kid home,

30:35.167 --> 30:37.795
see if someone stupid
don't answer the door.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.759
Mmm-hmm.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.090
I like them nice, too.

30:43.050 --> 30:47.851
- You know, that certain special way.
- Special? What do you mean?

30:48.013 --> 30:51.313
Yeah, special.
You know, Mary, that's what you are.

30:53.852 --> 30:55.695
Have you ever been to Le Pavillon?

30:55.854 --> 30:58.152
Oh, yes, honey. Chris and I, we...

31:00.025 --> 31:01.117
No.

31:01.943 --> 31:03.240
Tomorrow night at 8:00.

31:03.403 --> 31:05.826
We'll see how you adapt
to the finer side of life.

31:05.989 --> 31:07.457
We'll be there.

31:07.616 --> 31:08.788
May I?

31:34.559 --> 31:36.812
Why did Mrs. Wellington
give you that message?

31:36.978 --> 31:39.948
She's my friend.
She told me all about you.

31:40.273 --> 31:43.243
- Oh, yeah? What did she say?
- Guess.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.164
She said I'm an angel, and her heart flies

31:48.323 --> 31:50.121
when she's in my arms.

31:50.283 --> 31:53.753
Well, it must be easy to float
with a head as swelled as yours.

31:58.125 --> 32:01.095
Big as a balloon,
so I can touch the clouds.

32:01.837 --> 32:04.260
So can I. My father has a Learjet.

32:04.881 --> 32:06.224
Hmm.

32:10.512 --> 32:13.482
It's no fun to depend
on other people for rides.

32:13.640 --> 32:17.440
Especially not when you're used to
taking them for rides the way you do.

32:17.686 --> 32:21.816
- What do you want from me, Mary?
- To know what you want from me.

32:29.406 --> 32:32.205
I want to take you on a trip to the moon.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.750
- Who's paying?
- It's free.

32:42.711 --> 32:45.555
But I guess you wouldn't know
anything about that.

32:45.755 --> 32:47.507
- Punk!
- Brat.

32:47.674 --> 32:50.518
- Gigolo!
- Cabbage head!

32:51.470 --> 32:52.642
What?

32:57.809 --> 33:00.483
What's the matter, late for work?

33:01.855 --> 33:03.072
Yeah.

33:08.028 --> 33:09.655
You're blowing it.

33:09.821 --> 33:12.791
Tricky, come and dance with me.

33:46.858 --> 33:48.701
Oh, no.

33:51.947 --> 33:54.200
Nobody like your body, baby.

33:59.913 --> 34:01.631
Oh.

34:02.499 --> 34:05.548
We'll be landing on the moon
in three minutes.

34:21.476 --> 34:23.603
Mary, Mary, Mary.

34:24.563 --> 34:25.906
I guess you don't like

34:26.063 --> 34:29.568
your daddy fooling around
with Mrs. Wellington, do you?

34:30.819 --> 34:33.368
Christopher ain't going to
fall into that trap.

34:33.530 --> 34:36.248
No. Too cool for that.

34:38.034 --> 34:39.411
Yo, Isaac!

34:40.579 --> 34:43.458
Stroke it a couple times for me, cousin!

34:43.748 --> 34:46.967
Make sure you put a pillow up her ass.
She like that.

35:08.481 --> 35:10.404
Who the hell was that?

35:11.735 --> 35:13.703
I don't suppose you happen to know

35:13.862 --> 35:16.615
the owner of that charming voice,
would you?

35:17.198 --> 35:18.541
Hmm?

35:20.744 --> 35:21.916
Man, that was dog.

35:22.078 --> 35:25.127
She set you up to bust in
on her old man's private business?

35:26.124 --> 35:30.630
She don't know that what's good enough
for Isaac Sharon is even better for me.

35:31.838 --> 35:35.183
- She's bad, cousin.
- Yeah, but she ain't got no street.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.975
You know, I wish there was some way
we could bring her down to our world.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.481
Then she could experience the real fun.

35:41.931 --> 35:45.231
Tell you what. Give me a dark room
and a Sam Cooke album,

35:45.393 --> 35:47.487
and I'll show her the real fun.

35:47.812 --> 35:51.237
No, man. That's not what she's about.
She's above that.

35:51.608 --> 35:54.953
She just needs to loosen up.
Mary already knows who she is.

35:55.111 --> 35:57.705
She just doesn't know what she wants.

35:58.323 --> 36:00.075
Father, be a dear and call Emile

36:00.241 --> 36:03.290
and tell him I may possibly want to
take the boat out tonight.

36:03.453 --> 36:08.050
Now slow down a minute, Mary.
That's a big responsibility.

36:09.000 --> 36:12.129
You've never taken the boat out
by yourself before.

36:12.504 --> 36:16.259
Yes, well, it's about time I started
to do one or two things by myself.

36:16.424 --> 36:18.017
Don't you think?

36:19.511 --> 36:23.482
No, Tricky. I don't think so.
She is definitely a virgin.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.311
You know, I think she's afraid of men.

36:29.646 --> 36:31.740
She ain't afraid of Tricky.

36:33.775 --> 36:37.075
Honey, I'm just afraid of you
going out unprotected.

36:37.237 --> 36:40.867
- Good heavens! What am I going to do?
- You're free to do whatever you wish.

36:41.032 --> 36:42.625
- Am I?
- Yes.

36:44.536 --> 36:47.665
You know the terms
for your getting the trust.

36:47.831 --> 36:51.085
You've changed the terms
over the past three years!

36:55.588 --> 36:57.841
All I've tried to do is please you.

36:58.007 --> 37:01.386
Yes, so you could get your money
and get out of here.

37:03.012 --> 37:06.312
- I just want my own life.
- You don't know what you want.

37:06.474 --> 37:08.977
Mary, the trust is yours
the moment you and Jonathan are wed.

37:09.144 --> 37:11.691
Now, life cannot be simpler
than that, can it?

37:13.565 --> 37:15.659
She just doesn't know what she wants.

37:15.817 --> 37:18.866
She wants
some of Tricky Dean's pork sausage.

37:19.028 --> 37:23.124
Please. I can see it now.
You and Mary Sharon.

37:23.283 --> 37:26.127
"Mother, dear, I'd like you to meet
me new husband."

37:26.286 --> 37:30.132
When the police come to take your ass
down to the joint, this is me.

37:33.877 --> 37:36.300
"Oh, no. I don't know him.

37:37.046 --> 37:40.141
"He said what, Officer? My brother?

37:41.176 --> 37:45.397
"Oh, no. We definitely have
different fathers. Check it out.

37:47.599 --> 37:51.945
"Butterscotch. Chocolate. No way."

38:06.534 --> 38:09.863
Honey, don't you know
I'll slap the waves out of your head!

38:20.632 --> 38:23.806
Man, I've never seen nobody chase girls
the way you do.

38:23.968 --> 38:27.438
I'll stop chasing girls
when you stop chasing Trickies.

38:28.223 --> 38:30.772
Mary doesn't like you, she likes me.

38:31.851 --> 38:34.821
And tonight,
she's going to dance to my tune.

38:38.066 --> 38:39.067
Tricky.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.286
You've just given me a brilliant idea.

38:45.573 --> 38:46.699
What?

38:46.908 --> 38:50.458
We are going to bring Mary Sharon
down to our world.

38:51.371 --> 38:52.623
Come on.

39:15.770 --> 39:17.772
- Bonsoir.
- Good evening.

39:18.022 --> 39:21.071
- Ah, so you do have normal clothing.
- I hate these clothes.

39:21.234 --> 39:23.236
I think it's a vast improvement.

39:23.403 --> 39:24.950
Where's Tricky?

39:25.196 --> 39:28.450
He ran back to the car
to fetch his manners. Shall we?

39:56.185 --> 39:58.187
To knowledge.

39:58.813 --> 40:01.066
Knowledge?
What do you know from knowledge?

40:01.232 --> 40:03.576
- You ever been to Miami, baby?
- I have.

40:03.735 --> 40:06.238
Garçon! You forgot one.

40:06.404 --> 40:07.826
There's nothing in Miami

40:07.989 --> 40:10.959
but people who weren't born there
and drugs.

40:11.117 --> 40:14.872
They know more than you'll ever learn
in your little, small, sheltered world.

40:15.038 --> 40:18.668
- Yeah!
- Really, now? What, only God knows.

40:19.167 --> 40:21.135
Garçon!

40:21.711 --> 40:23.008
Yes, sir?

40:25.548 --> 40:26.800
That's French.

40:30.219 --> 40:34.895
It's obvious little Miss Mary
has never been off the city block.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.314
What on Earth is that? Some new language?

40:40.480 --> 40:41.606
Read it.

40:41.773 --> 40:43.446
You know what it is?

40:45.026 --> 40:46.653
It's nothing, and you know it

40:46.819 --> 40:49.663
but you won't confess it
because you're such a coward.

40:49.822 --> 40:52.245
It is something. Something you don't know.

40:52.408 --> 40:54.536
You won't confess that
because you're a coward.

40:54.869 --> 40:57.292
This is silly, and you're a child.

40:58.039 --> 41:00.462
I go to dinner
without my father's permission.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.298
So that says what?

41:04.045 --> 41:07.800
Now read it aloud so we can all hear
how knowledgeable you are.

41:11.344 --> 41:13.212
"Wrecka stow."

41:16.683 --> 41:18.685
You know what it is? You don't, do you?

41:18.851 --> 41:21.124
Wrecka stow? It's nothing.

41:23.314 --> 41:24.736
It is something.

41:24.899 --> 41:27.994
Come on. Read it again.
This time say it louder.

41:29.696 --> 41:31.994
- Wrecka stow.
- Louder.

41:32.365 --> 41:34.633
Wrecka stow! I give up.

41:35.243 --> 41:37.496
- What is it?
- Wait, wait.

41:39.414 --> 41:43.260
If you wanted to buy a Sam Cooke album,
where would you go?

41:50.258 --> 41:52.531
The record store.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.734
Very amusing. Shall I laugh now
or wait until I get into the car?

41:59.892 --> 42:01.109
You know that was fun.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.361
Oh, look!

42:16.367 --> 42:19.291
- Tricky, my boy.
- Our world.

42:26.502 --> 42:27.503
Oh, grow up!

42:27.670 --> 42:28.967
Tricky, put the box up.

42:29.130 --> 42:31.053
This music is a little weak. Do you mind?

44:54.817 --> 44:56.319
Hello, Daddy.

44:57.904 --> 44:59.702
This is Christopher. This is Tricky.

44:59.864 --> 45:03.164
This is my father.
And his two right hands.

45:03.784 --> 45:06.754
Or are they left hands?
I can never remember.

45:11.417 --> 45:13.260
Don't be angry, Daddy.

45:14.587 --> 45:17.306
I just wanted to do something special
for a change.

45:18.299 --> 45:19.516
Mary.

45:25.264 --> 45:26.811
Let's go home.

45:31.187 --> 45:32.734
Boo!

45:40.112 --> 45:41.489
Party poop!

45:51.958 --> 45:54.302
I want you to find out
who those two bums are

45:54.460 --> 45:56.963
and what they're doing
with my daughter. Compris?

45:57.129 --> 45:58.756
Okay, Mr. Sharon.

46:28.286 --> 46:30.630
Oh, Isaac was kind of clean tonight,
wasn't he?

46:30.788 --> 46:32.461
He was pretty dap.

46:35.293 --> 46:37.887
- You know, Tricky, one day I'm going to...
- Chris.

46:38.045 --> 46:39.672
- What?
- You know...

46:41.882 --> 46:43.634
I kind of like Mary.

46:43.801 --> 46:44.893
Oh.

46:46.053 --> 46:47.680
Listen, do me a favor.

46:47.972 --> 46:51.602
Why don't you handle the money
and leave the drawers to me?

46:51.809 --> 46:52.810
Hmm?

47:00.318 --> 47:01.695
What it is?

47:02.695 --> 47:04.038
It's Mary.

47:08.993 --> 47:11.041
I was wondering what you were doing.

47:12.788 --> 47:13.880
Mary.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.093
Thinking.

47:55.873 --> 47:57.250
About what?

47:59.585 --> 48:01.077
Sex.

48:17.728 --> 48:19.230
Christopher...

48:21.399 --> 48:23.743
If you were here, I'd...

48:34.912 --> 48:38.667
- Can I tell you something?
- No, don't. You'll ruin it.

48:40.709 --> 48:43.553
You've done some dumb-ass things before,
but this, my friend, takes the cake.

48:43.712 --> 48:44.884
Shh!

48:45.047 --> 48:46.264
There.

48:46.924 --> 48:50.974
Now remember, if anybody comes,
you whistle four times.

48:53.514 --> 48:57.018
Dumb-ass, you don't even know
if it's the right window.

49:02.398 --> 49:03.741
Pizza man.

49:07.153 --> 49:08.405
Dumb-ass!

49:15.619 --> 49:17.838
Did you order a pizza, ma'am?

49:18.831 --> 49:20.799
Talk of pleasant surprises.

49:20.958 --> 49:24.508
That's what it is.
Just relax and let me do all the work.

49:24.795 --> 49:29.301
Oh, you may have to. I take a couple
of Seconals to get to sleep.

49:33.679 --> 49:37.980
Got me out here in the middle of the night
watching a window.

49:38.517 --> 49:41.612
"Handle the money
and leave the drawers to me."

50:05.794 --> 50:06.886
Shit!

50:15.804 --> 50:18.148
Oh, darling. It's been so long.

50:18.307 --> 50:20.651
Won't be much longer now, baby.

50:24.813 --> 50:26.360
What was that?

50:26.690 --> 50:28.738
I think it was my zipper.

50:32.238 --> 50:33.990
Baby, wait! I ain't into all that.

50:34.198 --> 50:36.576
Psst! It's the mom.

50:36.742 --> 50:38.244
What did you say, darling?

50:38.410 --> 50:41.004
I said, uh, it's the wine.

50:41.163 --> 50:44.007
Hang on, love. I have to use the bathroom.

50:47.753 --> 50:49.255
Hurry, honey.

50:49.797 --> 50:51.799
I can't wait any longer.

50:53.050 --> 50:54.302
Dumb-ass!

50:54.468 --> 50:57.438
What did you expect me to do?
Go in a room full of lights on?

50:57.596 --> 51:00.816
You did it to Mary's mom.

51:00.975 --> 51:02.852
Get the ladder! Shut up!

51:03.018 --> 51:05.521
- You did it to Mary's mom.
- Fuck it!

51:09.316 --> 51:11.489
- Hello, darling.
- Oh, Isaac.

51:12.361 --> 51:14.534
I can no longer be passive.

51:16.115 --> 51:18.788
Take me now! Darling!

51:51.984 --> 51:53.327
Who it is?

51:56.113 --> 51:57.581
What is this?

51:57.740 --> 51:59.538
Soul. What's this?

51:59.700 --> 52:02.249
My dad felt guilty
about missing my birthday party

52:02.411 --> 52:05.540
and gave me a belated present.
I don't know what to do with it.

52:05.706 --> 52:08.630
So I thought a couple of pros like you
might have a good idea.

52:08.792 --> 52:11.762
Tricky, Mary don't know
what to do with that.

52:13.172 --> 52:14.594
Hmm. That's a hard one.

52:14.757 --> 52:17.010
Oh! I know! Why don't we spend it?

52:35.486 --> 52:38.706
Dig it. I need this car.

52:38.906 --> 52:40.783
All right? 200 francs.

52:42.201 --> 52:43.453
400,000 francs.

52:46.372 --> 52:49.246
700,000 francs. What it is?

53:02.137 --> 53:03.514
What it is?

53:03.889 --> 53:06.062
Mary, hop into your new car.

53:06.684 --> 53:08.982
This is as far as I want to go.

53:09.561 --> 53:11.804
For now, anyway.

53:23.659 --> 53:27.334
Meet me at the hippodrome
an hour after the sun goes down.

53:45.139 --> 53:47.358
Tricky, today is a wonderful day.

53:47.516 --> 53:50.315
How'd you dig it if I told you
I was leaving the business?

53:50.477 --> 53:53.572
That's right.
Christopher Tracy, an honest man.

53:56.817 --> 54:00.162
Seriously. I've been thinking
that if you really love someone

54:00.320 --> 54:04.075
it would go deeper than the flesh,
but be happier than sex.

54:05.242 --> 54:07.336
Really, Tricky,
there's got to be something else.

54:07.494 --> 54:11.044
If two people really dug one another, they
couldn't be torn apart no matter what.

54:11.206 --> 54:13.379
For example, do you love me?

54:14.293 --> 54:17.046
Come on, Tricky, you know
what I'm talking about.

54:17.254 --> 54:19.302
Girl, I loved you for years.

54:19.465 --> 54:21.559
- Tricky. Seriously. Do you?
- What? Yeah, I guess.

54:21.717 --> 54:23.685
- Yes?
- Yeah!

54:23.844 --> 54:26.017
That's my point, if two souls are one,

54:26.180 --> 54:28.774
I mean, if that's the ultimate,
then the flesh is nothing.

54:28.932 --> 54:30.058
We live in a parade.

54:30.225 --> 54:31.727
- Dig?
- Yes, I dig.

54:31.894 --> 54:33.942
I'll be the one digging your grave.

54:34.104 --> 54:38.325
Listen, I like Mary as much as you do,
probably more, but this is business.

54:38.484 --> 54:41.033
- Tricky, try to understand.
- No, you understand.

54:41.195 --> 54:42.913
If we don't get some bread
and get back to Miami soon,

54:43.113 --> 54:45.115
Isaac Sharon's gonna mess one of us up.

54:45.282 --> 54:47.410
And, honey, it ain't gonna be me.

54:47.576 --> 54:50.204
- What's the matter? Afraid to die?
- Yes.

54:50.370 --> 54:52.247
Well, I ain't afraid of shit.

54:54.374 --> 54:56.342
Are you afraid of bats?

55:17.648 --> 55:19.946
What should I wear to the joint tonight?

55:20.108 --> 55:22.452
My Versace or my Bonucci?

55:24.238 --> 55:27.117
I don't know, man.
I think I like that blue.

55:28.659 --> 55:30.707
What time we pick Mary up?

55:30.953 --> 55:34.207
- Uh, I got something I got to do first.
- What you got to do?

55:34.373 --> 55:35.465
Something.

55:35.624 --> 55:37.376
Damn, I got to keep my eye on you.

55:37.543 --> 55:39.796
Your name should be Tricky.
Tricky Christopher.

55:39.962 --> 55:41.635
Meet you at the club in two hours.

55:41.797 --> 55:43.174
- Two hours?
- Two hours.

55:43.340 --> 55:44.887
All right, Chris.

56:57.539 --> 56:59.257
Do you want to race?

56:59.416 --> 57:00.963
On your mark.

57:31.823 --> 57:33.541
Uh, baby, they saw you coming!

57:34.910 --> 57:36.628
That car is worthless!

59:11.298 --> 59:14.302
- Marvelous night, isn't it?
- Yeah. If you like getting dogged.

59:14.468 --> 59:15.469
Oh, my dear.

59:15.844 --> 59:18.393
If you have nothing nice to say
about anybody,

59:18.555 --> 59:20.683
please come and sit with us.

59:23.602 --> 59:25.650
Quel scandale!

59:34.529 --> 59:36.156
What's so funny?

59:38.950 --> 59:40.873
- You can't spell.
- What?

59:42.412 --> 59:43.834
"Liffy is a poem."

59:43.997 --> 59:46.420
"Life is a parade." Give me this.

59:51.963 --> 59:54.432
I must have that disease.
What's the name of it?

59:54.591 --> 59:56.343
It's called "stupid."

01:00:00.347 --> 01:00:02.816
You're a bit of a maniac, aren't you?

01:00:02.974 --> 01:00:04.772
Yeah, you're one of them closet maniacs.

01:00:04.935 --> 01:00:07.484
You needed somebody like me
to bring it out of you.

01:00:07.646 --> 01:00:08.772
Oh, give me a break.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.862
Why is your dad such a punk?

01:00:11.733 --> 01:00:15.328
- I beg your pardon?
- Why does he shit on so many people?

01:00:15.612 --> 01:00:17.990
- You're a peasant.
- What makes me a peasant?

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:20.955
How much money I got,
or what's in my heart?

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:23.541
You know, I wish your dear father
could see us when we kiss.

01:00:23.703 --> 01:00:27.333
It's a little bit different than it is
with your rich boyfriend, ain't it?

01:00:27.499 --> 01:00:29.376
As a matter of fact,
it's not so hot, you bit me once.

01:00:29.543 --> 01:00:31.671
Given the chance,
I'd knock the bottom out of them drawers.

01:00:31.837 --> 01:00:34.090
And your hair's greasy.
Do you use cooking oil?

01:00:34.256 --> 01:00:37.601
"Christopher, this is so nice.
I've never done it in a piano before."

01:00:37.759 --> 01:00:41.263
- Oh, you're obnoxious!
- You probably real quiet at first.

01:00:41.513 --> 01:00:43.766
"Oh, oh." Then you get loud.

01:00:45.892 --> 01:00:47.644
And then you get black.

01:00:47.811 --> 01:00:53.488
"Oh, shit! Christopher, oh, shit!
Oh, baby! Oh, no!"

01:00:57.237 --> 01:01:00.411
Aw, did I hurt little Mary's feelings?

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:06.622
You ain't funky at all.
You're just a little old prude.

01:01:06.788 --> 01:01:08.790
A little rich party poop.

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:10.633
Shut up!

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:15.723
Jesus Christ. Shut up?
I'm calling your daddy this instant.

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:21.683
Be quiet, maybe, yes. Pipe down.
But not "shut up." Oh, no.

01:01:22.929 --> 01:01:24.476
Yo, you got a dime?

01:01:28.143 --> 01:01:30.111
Shut up!

01:01:30.478 --> 01:01:32.276
I like that. Not bad.

01:01:45.869 --> 01:01:46.916
Hello?

01:01:47.871 --> 01:01:50.374
Yes, this is Lou.
May I speak to Mr. Sharon, please?

01:01:51.374 --> 01:01:53.172
Oh. Is it important?

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.552
Yes.

01:01:54.836 --> 01:01:56.759
- He's sleeping.
- Please.

01:01:57.589 --> 01:01:58.932
All right.

01:02:00.258 --> 01:02:01.976
- What?
- It's for you.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:03.637
Ugh.

01:02:06.655 --> 01:02:09.564
- Yeah, Lou. What is it?
- Isaac, get your ass out of that bed.

01:02:09.726 --> 01:02:11.728
You know them's my drawers.

01:02:11.895 --> 01:02:13.147
Who the hell is this?

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:17.697
The delivery boy from the liquor store.
I brought you champagne the other day.

01:02:18.026 --> 01:02:20.825
Tell me where you are,
and I'll come and kick your face off!

01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:25.792
Did you say kiss my face off?
Well, I'd like that real well,

01:02:25.951 --> 01:02:28.204
because that's just what I did
to your daughter.

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:31.415
I'm going to marry her, Isaac.
She loves me.

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.710
She doesn't know it yet.
But when she does, she'll be mine.

01:02:34.876 --> 01:02:37.470
It doesn't matter what you do to us.
She'll always belong to me.

01:02:38.338 --> 01:02:41.308
If you try to stop us,
I'll give this number to your wife.

01:02:41.466 --> 01:02:43.013
She knows what I'd do to you!

01:02:43.176 --> 01:02:44.598
Ugly bastard!

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:47.765
There's one way to find out.
Just mess with me.

01:02:47.931 --> 01:02:50.150
You rich folks always take
from people like me.

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:54.688
That says what? That says
now I'll take something from you.

01:02:56.273 --> 01:02:59.652
He can destroy you. You have no idea.

01:02:59.901 --> 01:03:01.995
The chief inspector is on his payroll.

01:03:02.153 --> 01:03:04.121
- Does he love you?
- Yes.

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:06.204
Then I can destroy him.

01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:34.903
You want?

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.240
Yes.

01:03:40.233 --> 01:03:42.702
No. When I want it.

01:03:43.069 --> 01:03:45.367
You rich girls want everything.

01:03:45.739 --> 01:03:46.911
No.

01:03:48.616 --> 01:03:50.084
I want more.

01:04:18.897 --> 01:04:20.399
Thank you.

01:04:32.619 --> 01:04:33.711
Mary!

01:04:37.415 --> 01:04:38.416
Mary.

01:04:39.417 --> 01:04:42.170
Your mother and I would like to see you.

01:04:45.882 --> 01:04:48.886
Oh, hello, darling.
We were just talking about you.

01:04:49.052 --> 01:04:50.804
Where have you been?

01:04:51.846 --> 01:04:55.350
- You were out all night.
- Was I?

01:04:55.975 --> 01:04:57.602
I don't remember.

01:05:02.816 --> 01:05:04.739
- Who were you with?
- Friends.

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:06.574
Who? What friends?

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.613
I want an explanation.

01:05:08.863 --> 01:05:12.993
Do I have to give you a written report,
or can I just phone it in?

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:15.708
Mary!

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:19.249
You were with that boy.

01:05:19.416 --> 01:05:21.009
He's not a boy, he's a man.

01:05:21.167 --> 01:05:23.386
He's not a man, he's a gigolo.

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:26.802
You know what that is?
That is a fancy word for a whore.

01:05:26.965 --> 01:05:28.683
There are a lot of words
for "whore," Daddy,

01:05:28.842 --> 01:05:31.265
and I'm sure you're well acquainted
with all of them.

01:05:31.428 --> 01:05:34.147
It's time that you understand
the importance of your marriage

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:37.149
and what it could do to this family
and your future.

01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:40.733
Do you have any idea
of how much the Donahues are worth?

01:05:40.895 --> 01:05:43.364
Why, with our combined fortunes...

01:05:48.528 --> 01:05:50.496
Mary, you have no right!

01:05:51.865 --> 01:05:53.538
Now, that's nerve.

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:25.653
"I'll meet you at the club in two hours."

01:06:30.445 --> 01:06:32.197
- I got waylaid.
- No.

01:06:32.572 --> 01:06:34.074
You got laid.

01:06:37.577 --> 01:06:41.377
You dogged me. You lied to me!
You broke the rules of our partnership.

01:06:41.539 --> 01:06:43.758
You're jive, and you got laid.

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:48.380
Tricky, you know, I think you're cute,
but you're not my wife.

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:54.102
Why, you selfish son of a biscuit-eater.
I thought we were partners!

01:06:54.344 --> 01:06:55.846
Not this time.

01:06:56.429 --> 01:06:58.352
I'll tell you why, too.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:07.028
'Cause you know if I drop the bomb
on Mary, she'll fall in love with me.

01:07:09.484 --> 01:07:10.986
You're drunk.

01:07:14.948 --> 01:07:18.623
Yeah, Christopher, I'm drunk.
But, hey, guess what?

01:07:19.285 --> 01:07:20.787
You're stupid!

01:07:21.996 --> 01:07:25.626
I told you never to mix emotion
with business. Deadly combination.

01:07:25.792 --> 01:07:27.635
Have you seen my phone book?

01:07:27.794 --> 01:07:31.344
- I bet you she don't even like you.
- I know she likes me.

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:35.476
Yeah? Well, I got news for you.

01:07:37.011 --> 01:07:41.437
Women don't like you. They use you.
When they've used you up, they're gone.

01:07:46.396 --> 01:07:49.024
You just said the wrong thing, Tricky.

01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:51.074
Punk!

01:07:51.234 --> 01:07:53.862
Mary sure ain't gonna be
playing with you no more.

01:07:54.028 --> 01:07:57.874
Not when Tricky done with her!
That's right! That's my drawers now!

01:07:58.032 --> 01:07:59.409
- She'll be throwing rocks at you.
- Tricky!

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.501
What's up, Christopher?

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:11.596
Let's run away.

01:08:13.006 --> 01:08:14.724
For a couple of hours.

01:08:17.176 --> 01:08:18.803
Why not forever?

01:08:40.617 --> 01:08:44.042
Christopher, I'm afraid.

01:08:44.537 --> 01:08:47.881
Afraid of what?
Tricky and I come here all the time.

01:08:48.666 --> 01:08:50.134
Afraid of us.

01:08:51.002 --> 01:08:53.345
- My father is very...
- Your father.

01:08:53.504 --> 01:08:56.053
You know as well as I do he ain't no good.

01:08:56.215 --> 01:08:58.889
Why can't you admit it? Come on, say it.

01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:02.893
Christopher, do you love me?

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:04.649
Define love.

01:10:30.351 --> 01:10:31.728
- Yes?
- Sam?

01:10:33.938 --> 01:10:35.110
Isaac?

01:10:35.940 --> 01:10:37.192
That's right.

01:10:38.192 --> 01:10:39.535
Listen, uh...

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:43.740
I have a little problem
I want you to help me with.

01:10:56.836 --> 01:10:57.962
Look.

01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:05.682
Why don't you go home and sleep it off.

01:11:05.845 --> 01:11:08.940
You and Christopher
will be best friends again in the morning.

01:11:09.098 --> 01:11:12.978
Never! He dogged me, lied to me, he...

01:11:15.563 --> 01:11:17.907
Mary was my girl as much as his!

01:11:18.733 --> 01:11:19.905
Kiss me.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:30.669
You don't really love Jonathan, do you?

01:11:31.829 --> 01:11:35.675
If I tell you, will you tell me something
about the women you go out with?

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:37.460
- Yes.
- No.

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:41.089
Now you talk.

01:11:43.257 --> 01:11:44.304
Kiss me first.

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:48.517
Say, now!
Don't you two make a sexy couple?

01:11:48.679 --> 01:11:52.650
When's the wedding?
I said, when's the wedding, man?

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.483
You still gonna marry her, aren't you?
That's what you said.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:59.741
You said for $50 million,
you'd seriously consider it.

01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:02.448
- Mary...
- But guess what. I want my cut!

01:12:02.610 --> 01:12:05.238
You promised me 30%! I want it.

01:12:05.404 --> 01:12:08.749
Mary, we got a little business deal.
Don't take it personally.

01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:10.623
It's not true, Mary.

01:12:13.246 --> 01:12:14.623
Do you lie?

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:24.090
Mary!

01:12:29.136 --> 01:12:30.763
Damn it, Tricky!

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:36.269
You dumb shit! What did you do that for?

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:39.276
Because it's a full moon.
I'm a werewolf, bitch.

01:12:39.438 --> 01:12:41.190
Kiss my ass!

01:12:56.914 --> 01:12:58.382
You dogged me, Chris!

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:01.010
- Shut up, stupid!
- No, you shut up!

01:13:01.419 --> 01:13:04.343
You're going to end up
with no friends at all.

01:13:04.505 --> 01:13:07.384
I don't need friends. I'm my own man.

01:13:10.136 --> 01:13:11.888
Just like Liberace.

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:31.366
Christopher.

01:13:31.991 --> 01:13:34.335
When can we get together again?

01:13:34.619 --> 01:13:36.371
You know I miss you.

01:13:39.457 --> 01:13:41.880
Christopher, you know I miss you.

01:13:45.212 --> 01:13:49.433
Mary! My God, where have you been?
We've been worried sick about you.

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:52.554
Pack your bags, Mother.
We're flying to New York tonight.

01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.519
- Whatever for? Jonathan's...
- Mother!

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:05.525
For 21 years now, I've listened
to you and Father tell me what to do.

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:10.705
You've painted a picture
of a perfect world

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:14.618
and you've framed it
with hypocrisy, stubbornness, and lies.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:18.830
And you've hung it
on a trust fund I can't get

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:21.624
until I marry a man I don't even love.

01:14:27.463 --> 01:14:31.388
Doesn't it matter to you and Daddy
what I want?

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:35.471
- Of course it does, dear, but...
- Mother.

01:14:38.808 --> 01:14:40.230
Look at me.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:44.777
I am your painting.

01:14:49.443 --> 01:14:51.036
I hurt real bad.

01:14:53.364 --> 01:14:55.241
Mary.

01:14:58.077 --> 01:15:00.250
Don't you think I hurt, too?

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:03.462
We all hurt a little.

01:15:24.895 --> 01:15:26.647
Hello, Christopher.

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:40.878
Isaac asked me to give you this.

01:15:43.039 --> 01:15:44.541
It's yours...

01:15:46.417 --> 01:15:48.215
Under one condition.

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:54.301
Stay away from Mary for good.

01:16:02.892 --> 01:16:05.111
Give this to Isaac from me.

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:15.533
"Fa you?"

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:17.949
Tell him it's Chinese.

01:16:26.332 --> 01:16:27.800
Christopher, wait.

01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:33.221
She's leaving for New York
on the family plane.

01:16:33.380 --> 01:16:34.723
What time?

01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:36.763
Midnight.

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:43.186
Good luck, Christopher.

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:44.331
Mary, don't go!

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.619
What do you want?

01:17:45.911 --> 01:17:46.958
To talk to you.

01:17:47.163 --> 01:17:48.790
I don't want to hear it, Christopher.
I've heard enough.

01:17:49.081 --> 01:17:52.255
Just give me
five minutes of your time, please!

01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:54.003
Let him go.

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:56.885
Mary, what's going on?

01:17:57.173 --> 01:17:58.925
I said, let him go!

01:18:02.970 --> 01:18:05.064
You promise? Only five minutes.

01:18:05.222 --> 01:18:07.520
- Mary, please!
- Don't worry.

01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:09.185
Oh, God!

01:18:21.071 --> 01:18:23.870
You have exactly four and a half minutes.

01:18:26.869 --> 01:18:29.338
Mary, don't you see?

01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:33.167
I need a lifetime.

01:18:33.334 --> 01:18:34.836
I'm not giving it to you.

01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:37.596
On, yes, you are.

01:19:04.615 --> 01:19:06.868
I thought you wanted to talk.

01:19:09.161 --> 01:19:11.664
Maybe I just wanted to look at you.

01:19:14.792 --> 01:19:17.215
Why don't I give you a photograph?

01:19:20.172 --> 01:19:21.640
I want more.

01:19:54.665 --> 01:19:55.882
Isaac.

01:19:59.086 --> 01:20:00.929
Isaac, this is terrible.

01:20:01.088 --> 01:20:03.807
I tried to stop her.
I had no idea that she was...

01:20:03.966 --> 01:20:07.095
- Let me handle this. Who's in charge?
- I am.

01:20:07.511 --> 01:20:09.980
How the hell did you let this happen?

01:20:10.139 --> 01:20:12.608
Your daughter willingly agreed to go, sir.

01:20:12.766 --> 01:20:14.109
She was abducted!

01:20:14.268 --> 01:20:17.067
My wife saw her
being driven away against her will!

01:20:17.229 --> 01:20:18.355
What more do you want?

01:20:32.870 --> 01:20:34.838
Why are you doing this?

01:20:36.373 --> 01:20:39.126
- What do you want?
- I want to kiss you.

01:20:39.710 --> 01:20:42.259
Christopher, I don't know you anymore.

01:21:00.230 --> 01:21:03.109
You've been using me all this time.

01:21:04.318 --> 01:21:05.695
You whore.

01:21:18.499 --> 01:21:20.376
Oh, my God, he's gone mad.

01:21:22.086 --> 01:21:24.839
Christopher, if this is
your idea of a joke...

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:31.766
Take me back to the airport.

01:21:32.262 --> 01:21:33.354
Now.

01:21:39.770 --> 01:21:42.694
What's the matter with you? Say something!

01:21:48.112 --> 01:21:49.864
I hate you.

01:21:53.534 --> 01:21:54.956
I love you.

01:21:56.745 --> 01:21:58.418
You don't love me.

01:22:01.083 --> 01:22:02.960
Okay, then I hate you.

01:22:10.342 --> 01:22:11.844
No, you don't.

01:22:13.303 --> 01:22:14.976
Then I love you.

01:22:17.599 --> 01:22:18.976
Define love.

01:23:10.486 --> 01:23:12.534
Let me take you away from here...

01:23:14.114 --> 01:23:15.366
Forever.

01:23:29.213 --> 01:23:31.090
Look, Chris, I'm sorry.

01:23:31.423 --> 01:23:34.393
My tongue started dancing,
and I didn't know how to stop it.

01:23:34.551 --> 01:23:38.146
We can't let this silly dame come
between us. Let's kiss and make up.

01:23:42.476 --> 01:23:44.604
If you don't tell us
where your partner is,

01:23:44.978 --> 01:23:47.106
you can kiss your ass goodbye.

01:23:48.607 --> 01:23:49.904
Goodbye.

01:23:51.902 --> 01:23:53.870
Start talking, punk. Where is he?

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:56.657
In his skin, the last time I checked.

01:23:58.033 --> 01:23:59.831
Oh, no! My new tie!

01:24:02.955 --> 01:24:04.298
New tie, huh?

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:07.918
See these cuff links? $500.

01:24:08.085 --> 01:24:09.678
Come here, look.

01:24:10.796 --> 01:24:13.470
The shoes: $1,000. Finest money can buy.

01:24:23.517 --> 01:24:27.363
Only confused men wear loafers.
You aren't confused, are you?

01:24:37.823 --> 01:24:39.621
Yes. Yes.

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:42.248
That's the car.

01:24:43.036 --> 01:24:47.382
I want the coast guard
to scour every inch of the coast for them.

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:51.177
They must have gone off in a motorboat.

01:24:51.878 --> 01:24:54.973
I know it's a big ocean! So what?

01:24:56.258 --> 01:24:58.681
I shall be there in half an hour.

01:25:08.520 --> 01:25:11.239
Lou, the police have found the car.

01:25:12.232 --> 01:25:14.985
Eddy, his car's at Villefranche harbor.

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:17.162
Yeah, we're gonna...

01:25:17.613 --> 01:25:19.286
No, he's out cold.

01:25:21.617 --> 01:25:24.040
Yeah, we'll be ready in a minute.

01:25:24.745 --> 01:25:27.373
Yeah, Mr. Sharon, we know what to do.

01:26:10.916 --> 01:26:13.089
I want to be an honest man

01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:17.594
I'll be your slave, just understand

01:26:19.591 --> 01:26:21.309
How much I need you

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:27.057
And if I lie

01:26:30.268 --> 01:26:31.315
I'm part of you

01:26:33.522 --> 01:26:35.274
This is my crime

01:26:35.774 --> 01:26:37.492
I do know laughter

01:26:37.943 --> 01:26:39.536
I do know tears

01:26:40.987 --> 01:26:44.617
But all is nothing without you near

01:26:46.410 --> 01:26:48.162
We are of one soul

01:26:48.745 --> 01:26:50.338
And if I died

01:26:51.748 --> 01:26:55.503
We'll be together side by side

01:26:57.212 --> 01:27:00.466
With you, I know that I can stand

01:27:02.092 --> 01:27:05.062
With you, I can be an honest man

01:27:28.368 --> 01:27:30.462
- Yo, Chris!
- What's going on?

01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:32.839
You ever had your ass kicked
for breakfast?

01:27:32.998 --> 01:27:34.841
No, but it looks like you just did.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.924
If you don't get out of here quick,
you will be next.

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.714
- Where's Mary?
- At the grotto. Why?

01:27:41.339 --> 01:27:42.716
That's why.

01:27:47.429 --> 01:27:48.681
Come on.

01:27:51.683 --> 01:27:52.855
Still mad at me?

01:27:53.018 --> 01:27:57.615
Put it this way. If we ever make it
to that wedding, I'll be your best man.

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:02.991
Hold them off. I'm going to get Mary.

01:28:14.122 --> 01:28:15.749
Katy, run!

01:28:20.796 --> 01:28:22.719
Strike! Put it on him!

01:28:24.841 --> 01:28:27.515
It's my turn now. Oh, man!

01:28:37.270 --> 01:28:39.022
That's right, cousin!

01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:40.441
My turn.

01:28:42.317 --> 01:28:43.318
Bonsoir!

01:29:11.304 --> 01:29:13.181
Katy, we got to hurry!

01:29:13.473 --> 01:29:15.225
Tricky, wait for me!

01:29:31.658 --> 01:29:32.910
Christopher, run!

01:29:33.076 --> 01:29:36.125
Get him! I don't care
what you do with him. Just get him!

01:29:38.623 --> 01:29:40.625
I'm not going without you.

01:29:41.668 --> 01:29:44.171
There's no time to wait! Go!

01:29:46.673 --> 01:29:48.050
Shoot him!

01:29:49.551 --> 01:29:50.677
Mary.

01:30:10.447 --> 01:30:11.869
Christopher.

01:30:20.498 --> 01:30:22.546
Damn, Chris.

01:30:34.220 --> 01:30:35.346
Oh, God!

01:30:39.351 --> 01:30:40.728
Dear God...

01:30:41.895 --> 01:30:43.989
Don't take Christopher yet.

01:30:44.564 --> 01:30:46.362
He ain't ready, Lord.

01:30:47.317 --> 01:30:48.694
He's just a baby.

01:30:51.071 --> 01:30:52.948
We had fun, didn't we?

01:30:57.535 --> 01:30:58.787
Not him!

01:31:00.246 --> 01:31:01.543
Not now!

01:31:10.173 --> 01:31:11.846
Christopher, damn!

01:31:13.927 --> 01:31:15.850
I told you we shouldn't have came here.

01:31:17.806 --> 01:31:18.898
Mary.

01:31:19.641 --> 01:31:22.736
There's nothing more can be done.

01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:27.190
Mary...

01:31:29.985 --> 01:31:31.487
Let's go home.

01:31:31.778 --> 01:31:33.530
I'm not going home.

01:31:34.656 --> 01:31:36.784
I'm going with Christopher.

01:31:39.744 --> 01:31:41.997
And don't try and stop me now.

01:32:37.052 --> 01:32:41.353
If two people really loved one another,
they'd be together forever.

01:32:41.973 --> 01:32:45.273
They couldn't be torn apart
no matter what happened.

01:32:54.819 --> 01:32:56.321
Tricky, look.

01:32:57.113 --> 01:32:58.706
It's from Mary.

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:10.969
"My darling Tricky, being alone is hard
but I'm dealing with it.

01:33:11.336 --> 01:33:15.807
"Although many have asked, I just can't
picture myself with anyone else.

01:33:16.132 --> 01:33:18.851
"I guess Christopher was right, after all.

01:33:19.385 --> 01:33:20.602
"What a world, eh?"

01:33:20.762 --> 01:33:24.858
I shall come in a few months to see
how our investment turned out.

01:33:25.016 --> 01:33:28.566
How do you like being the landlord
of your very own apartment complex?

01:33:28.728 --> 01:33:29.900
Fine.

01:33:30.688 --> 01:33:32.611
Give Katy a hug for me.

01:33:33.733 --> 01:33:35.576
I miss you, Tricky.

01:33:36.778 --> 01:33:38.200
Love, Mary.

01:33:39.531 --> 01:33:41.204
Wasn't that nice?

01:33:41.533 --> 01:33:43.831
You heard what Mary said, Tricky.

01:33:44.077 --> 01:33:45.624
Give me a hug.

01:33:46.246 --> 01:33:47.998
Oh, no, you don't. Not this time.

01:33:48.164 --> 01:33:50.041
I want the rent money paid in full,

01:33:50.208 --> 01:33:52.802
or I'm throwing you out
into the Miami streets.

01:33:52.961 --> 01:33:54.838
- Oh, Tricky!
- Think I won't?

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:57.048
Tricky, wait!

01:33:57.799 --> 01:34:01.804
No. I don't want to hear it.
I refuse to hear any excuses.

01:34:02.262 --> 01:34:05.186
No, no. I told you. Rent in full.

01:34:05.348 --> 01:34:08.898
You're 22 hours late
with your rent, and I need my money!
