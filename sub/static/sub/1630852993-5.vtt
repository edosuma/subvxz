Here to help me garden?

Actually... Gramsy, we're here
to ask you something.

01:24.375 --> 01:26.252
I didn't eat all the snacks.

You know that story about
the beast that lives
in the swamp?

01:35.929 --> 01:37.680
We're wondering...

01:37.764 --> 01:39.724
Is the New Orleans
Nightmare real?

01:39.808 --> 01:43.478
The New Orleans Nightmare?
'Course it's real.

01:43.561 --> 01:47.232
And I'll tell you all about
the time I met the beast.

02:22.934 --> 02:29.023

<i>my beignet.</i>

02:29.107 --> 02:30.400
[children scream]

02:30.483 --> 02:33.111
Lost a good beignet that day.

02:33.194 --> 02:36.322
But I'm sure you all have
nothing to worry about.

02:36.406 --> 02:37.740
I'm not worried at all.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.284
You can't trick me.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.452
I think you made
that whole story up
just to prank us.

02:41.536 --> 02:46.416
Made it up to prank ya?
Well, I need to get back
to my gardening.

02:46.499 --> 02:52.255
But remember, it's not
the clacking
or beignet snatching

02:52.338 --> 02:56.301
or ferocious growling
you gotta worry about.

02:56.384 --> 03:01.598
It's the super sticky slime
that'll get ya.

03:01.681 --> 03:03.099
I don't buy it.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.560
There's no way
the New Orleans Nightmare
is real.

03:05.643 --> 03:08.938
I've walked by the bayou
tons of times
and I've never seen it.

03:09.022 --> 03:11.983
You really think Gramsy's
trying to prank us?

03:12.066 --> 03:14.277
Like that time she put a sock
in my saxophone?

03:14.360 --> 03:16.863
Ah, the good old
socksophone prank.

03:16.946 --> 03:19.616

how to play a joke.

03:19.699 --> 03:20.992

03:46.559 --> 03:47.685
You're right.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.646
The New Orleans Nightmare
isn't real.

03:49.729 --> 03:54.442
It's just a silly story
that a lot of folks
in New Orleans tell.

03:54.525 --> 03:57.028
I knew it!
Great prank, Gramsy.

03:57.111 --> 03:59.530
You always pull off
the best ones,

03:59.614 --> 04:02.992
and the syrup
was a delicious touch.

04:03.076 --> 04:05.787
I wish all pranks
involved syrup.

04:05.870 --> 04:09.040
And top-notch stitching
on this costume.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.500
Thank you very much.

04:10.583 --> 04:13.127
And that exceptional
attention to detail

04:13.211 --> 04:17.674
is exactly why
I'm the DeGeneres family
prank master.

04:17.757 --> 04:20.134
DeGeneres family prank master?

04:20.218 --> 04:22.136
That title comes with a trophy.

04:22.220 --> 04:24.889
It's been in our family
for generations.

04:24.973 --> 04:27.725
It gets passed down
to the best prankster.

04:27.809 --> 04:30.812
The best prankster?
Hmm...

04:30.895 --> 04:33.022
I really got to get back
to gardening.

04:33.106 --> 04:36.025
No more New Orleans
Nightmare for me.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.320
I think it's time to out-prank
the prank master.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.781
You're going to out-prank
Gramsy?

04:41.864 --> 04:45.034
Are you sure
you're not biting off
more than you can chew?

04:45.118 --> 04:46.536
I did that once.

04:46.619 --> 04:49.747
Turns out there is such a thing
as too much pizza.

04:49.831 --> 04:52.375
Oh, I'm sure
Gramsy is the best.

04:52.458 --> 04:54.419
And if I want to
make her proud,

04:54.502 --> 04:56.421
I got to be
the best of the best.

04:56.504 --> 05:01.009
After all, she taught me
every prank she knows.

05:01.092 --> 05:02.927
To be the prank master,

05:03.011 --> 05:04.345
I'm going to have to
convince Gramsy

05:04.429 --> 05:06.431
the New Orleans Nightmare
is real.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.183
And I need your help.
Take these.

05:09.267 --> 05:12.103
The New Orleans Nightmare
is gonna help Gramsy garden?

05:12.186 --> 05:13.771
And make some soup?

05:13.855 --> 05:17.525
No, we're going to use
this stuff
to sound like the beast.

05:17.608 --> 05:19.402
Once Gramsy hears
the clacks and growls,

05:19.485 --> 05:22.030
she'll definitely be convinced
it's real.

Aw, how'd you know it was us?

05:41.507 --> 05:45.386
The true prankster always knows
when she's being pranked.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.226
Challenge accepted.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.606
So, what are we gonna do now?

05:56.689 --> 05:58.524
The scary sounds
were a nice try.

05:58.608 --> 06:02.070
But if I'm going to become
prank master,
I got to step it up.

06:02.904 --> 06:04.697
It's slime time.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.700
Gramsy! Hurry!

06:07.784 --> 06:10.453
The New Orleans Nightmare
broke into the kitchen
and stole all of our beignets.

06:10.536 --> 06:12.538
Whoa, Nelly, Elly-Belly!

06:12.622 --> 06:13.623
[Ellen] See?

06:13.706 --> 06:15.666
-What a mess!
-Exactly.

06:15.750 --> 06:19.754
The real New Orleans Nightmare
is so messy
and it must have gone this way.

06:19.837 --> 06:20.838
Come on.

06:20.922 --> 06:22.590
The trail leads to the bayou.

06:22.673 --> 06:25.676
This must mean
the New Orleans Nightmare
is real, right?

06:25.760 --> 06:28.638
Could be, or maybe...

06:28.721 --> 06:33.810
you and Becky and Freckle
made a slimy trail to prank me.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.354
Um...

06:36.437 --> 06:41.984
Gramsy, help!
The New Orleans Nightmare,
it slimed me!

06:42.068 --> 06:44.362
I'm so sticky.

06:44.445 --> 06:48.407
[sniffs] Do I smell
Coconut Cougar

06:48.491 --> 06:50.451
by Shampoo Paris?

06:50.535 --> 06:54.997
The beast uses
the same shampoo as me.

06:55.081 --> 06:57.667
So we didn't prank you?

06:57.750 --> 07:02.505
Nope. On the bright side,
Becky's hair never looked
shinier.

07:02.588 --> 07:04.924
But I know you can do better.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.634
Well, we tried.

07:06.717 --> 07:07.844
Don't worry, El.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.345
Your jokes are super funny
to us.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.763
This is no joke.

07:10.847 --> 07:12.306
A joke makes you laugh.

07:12.390 --> 07:14.559
This is a prank.
A "gotcha"!

07:14.642 --> 07:18.104
A prank is something
people will talk about
for generations.

07:18.187 --> 07:22.024
Okay, so maybe you can become
a prank master another time.

07:22.108 --> 07:25.528
No way! I gotta become
prank master today.

07:25.611 --> 07:26.737
I'm so close.

07:26.821 --> 07:30.449
I can feel that trophy
in my hands.

07:30.533 --> 07:32.410
Gramsy's right.
I can do better

07:52.847 --> 07:54.182

08:09.989 --> 08:13.576
Ugh! How am I gonna be
the prank master
if I can't out-prank Gramsy?

08:13.659 --> 08:15.745
If it's a trophy you want,

08:15.828 --> 08:17.663
a trophy you shall have.

08:17.747 --> 08:20.291
Oh, it's about so much
more than the trophy.

08:20.374 --> 08:22.752
It's about being
the best prankster
in the family.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.464
I think I finally figured out
how to prank Gramsy,

08:26.547 --> 08:31.177
and she's gonna be
so proud of me, and I think
I know how to make it work.

08:35.473 --> 08:38.059
Very funny, Elly-Belly.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.645
But a shadow
isn't gonna fool me.

08:41.604 --> 08:42.605
Ooh!

08:42.688 --> 08:44.565
Slime too?

08:44.649 --> 08:46.108
And the growl?

Aah!

-The New Orleans Nightmare!

Gotcha.

I know It's my sweet
second-place prankster Ellen
in a costume.

Costume? What costume?

09:23.062 --> 09:27.733

are here, then

-Gotcha!

as the New Orleans Nightmare
would convince you it was real.

You're right.

10:01.475 --> 10:03.728
It did. [chuckles]

10:03.811 --> 10:04.854
That was a blast.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.480
Maybe I should start
a new biz,

dressing up in beast costumes
and scaring people.

for that?

pranked me before.

-Yep.

without finishing my popcorn.

It is my great honor
to announce you,

are the new DeGeneres family
prank master.

10:37.636 --> 10:40.639
I want to thank
my best friends
Becky and Freckle.

10:40.723 --> 10:44.143
Without them, this prank
wouldn't have been possible.

10:44.226 --> 10:45.811
-Aw, shucks.
-It was nothing.

10:45.895 --> 10:48.564
And I especially
want to thank you, Gramsy.

10:48.647 --> 10:50.733
Prank you for teaching me
your pranking ways.
