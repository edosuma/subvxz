00:08.609 --> 00:10.542
- Oh, I hate when
they're all locked up.

00:10.544 --> 00:11.610
- Me too.

00:11.612 --> 00:13.211
I've already asked the lady.

00:13.213 --> 00:14.179
- Oh great, thank you.

00:45.646 --> 00:47.245
- [Retail Worker] Hi!

00:47.247 --> 00:49.047
Hope you haven't
been waiting long.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.515
- Oh no, all good.

00:50.517 --> 00:51.784
- [Retail Worker] Which
ones were you looking for?

00:51.786 --> 00:52.917
- You were here
first, you go ahead.

00:52.919 --> 00:54.052
- Oh, thanks.
- Yeah.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.054
- Could I just get
the black ones?

00:56.056 --> 00:59.158
(cheerful upbeat music)

01:13.474 --> 01:16.675
- Daddy, we need
bread, eggs and apples.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.743
- Wait, did you just read that?

01:18.745 --> 01:20.078
- Yep.
- Ooh!

01:20.080 --> 01:23.482
You are really reading,
you are like a real reader,

01:23.484 --> 01:26.284
this is a big deal, bubs.
- It's a huge deal.

01:26.286 --> 01:28.220
- But unfortunately
we will have to start

01:28.222 --> 01:30.155
shrinking your brain,
so Mike, grab her head.

01:30.157 --> 01:31.690
- Yep, got it.
- No!

01:31.692 --> 01:34.626
- Alright, get it, get it,
get it, get it, get it!

01:34.628 --> 01:36.561
Also please get dressed.

01:36.563 --> 01:38.296
- I can't believe
that, that's amazing.

01:38.298 --> 01:39.431
- I know, right?

01:39.433 --> 01:40.833
I mean, she was
actually like reading

01:40.835 --> 01:42.300
a real book this morning

01:42.302 --> 01:44.436
and she didn't just memorize
the words in the right order,

01:44.438 --> 01:47.305
like I tried to fuck with
her and skipped a few pages,

01:47.307 --> 01:48.907
she was onto me.

01:48.909 --> 01:50.242
- She is lucky to have you.

01:50.244 --> 01:51.844
- We've gotta get her a
couple of books for that drive

01:51.846 --> 01:53.178
to Santa Barbara.
- When are we going

01:53.180 --> 01:54.913
to Santa Barbara?
- You know, in two weeks

01:54.915 --> 01:56.314
for the long weekend.

01:56.316 --> 01:57.716
- Oh, you didn't tell me.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.184
- We talked about it

01:59.186 --> 02:01.253
at that horrible
fundraiser thing, remember.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.789
- Oh, so Brian knows about
the trip to Santa Barbara?

02:04.859 --> 02:08.193
- Yes, you were not there.

02:08.195 --> 02:09.994
Well, I'd love to
ask you a question.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.596
- Go for it, what's up?
- Would you like to go

02:11.598 --> 02:12.665
to Santa Barbara in two weeks?

02:12.667 --> 02:14.332
- Oh, sounds lovely, sure,
- Sorry.

02:14.334 --> 02:17.001
- That makes me feel better
about forgetting to tell you

02:17.003 --> 02:18.070
about my work retreat.

02:20.407 --> 02:22.807
What, what's happening?
- This?

02:22.809 --> 02:23.808
- Yeah.

02:23.810 --> 02:25.610
- It's just me
adorably waving to you,

02:25.612 --> 02:26.679
- Oh.
- from the seperate islands

02:26.681 --> 02:28.346
we now apparently live on.
- Great.

02:28.348 --> 02:30.215
- Actually they're
probably further away,

02:30.217 --> 02:32.885
so I probably should need
to do like one of these.

02:32.887 --> 02:35.620
Remember when we used
to spend time together?

02:35.622 --> 02:38.490
- I'm wearing that
tank top on my island.

02:38.492 --> 02:42.160
- No, you are not bringing
that goddamn tank top

02:42.162 --> 02:43.796
to your island, okay.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.699
I am going to build a boat,

02:47.701 --> 02:49.902
sail to your island
in the dead of night,

02:49.904 --> 02:53.305
find that horrible tank
top, put it in my boat,

02:53.307 --> 02:56.775
light the boat on fire,
push it out to sea

02:56.777 --> 03:00.312
and then swim with the
sharks back to my island.

03:00.314 --> 03:01.714
- Why would you do that?

03:01.716 --> 03:03.448
We'd finally be together.

03:03.450 --> 03:04.717
- You know why?

03:04.719 --> 03:06.585
Because you need to
learn from your mistakes,

03:06.587 --> 03:10.855
Michael Reginald Harris.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.857
- That is not my middle name.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.927
- Actually it is now, I
changed it two weeks ago.

03:14.929 --> 03:18.797
I forgot to tell you,
Brian knows, hear that?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.398
- Yeah.
- Call back

03:20.400 --> 03:24.336
to the Santa Barbara trip,
see you in Santa Barbs.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.740
(cheerful upbeat music)

03:27.742 --> 03:32.076
So this 18-year old and I
stood there for quite a while.

03:32.078 --> 03:34.146
- Why are you even buying
condoms, you're married?

03:34.148 --> 03:38.350
- Because Mike comes so fast,
it just slows everything down.

03:38.352 --> 03:39.684
- I guessed that,
I guessed that.

03:39.686 --> 03:41.086
- No, that is not true.
- No?

03:41.088 --> 03:43.155
- I don't.
- You're right, you're right,

03:43.157 --> 03:46.625
he comes so slowly,
that it's hard to watch.

03:46.627 --> 03:49.027
- I forgot how brutal
these poker games are.

03:49.029 --> 03:50.829
- I wish I had that luxury.
- Hm.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.298
- No, she went off the
pill, it was her choice.

03:53.300 --> 03:58.237
- Mike, how dare you share
my personal information.

03:59.373 --> 04:00.639
- Yeah, okay.
- You should get an IUD.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.974
- Really?
- Yeah,

04:01.976 --> 04:03.375
I went out with this
girl, who had an IUD

04:03.377 --> 04:04.576
and it's the best thing,
because she's basically saying,

04:04.578 --> 04:06.645
"Hey, let's rod dog it, bro."

04:06.647 --> 04:08.112
- Oh.
- Ugh!

04:08.114 --> 04:11.984
- Okay, I am loathe to
admit this after your cool,

04:11.986 --> 04:14.586
let's rod dog it,
bro, turn of phrase,

04:14.588 --> 04:17.122
but I'm actually thinking
of getting an IUD.

04:17.124 --> 04:18.991
- Oh, wow, my Mom has an IUD.

04:18.993 --> 04:20.859
- Your mother is dead, Brandon.

04:20.861 --> 04:23.127
- Well, she asked to
be buried with it.

04:23.129 --> 04:24.863
- Ah, Jesus.
- That actually makes sense,

04:24.865 --> 04:26.130
they can be very expensive.
- Hm-mm.

04:26.132 --> 04:27.599
- Do you think we
can dig hers up

04:27.601 --> 04:29.067
and just throw it up in me?

04:29.069 --> 04:29.934
- Oh, you know what, maybe.

04:29.936 --> 04:31.203
- Really?
- Yeah, tomorrow

04:31.205 --> 04:34.006
let's go to the cemetery
and ask her ourselves.

04:34.008 --> 04:35.674
- Great, I look forward to that.

04:35.676 --> 04:37.676
It will have to be
though in the afternoon,

04:37.678 --> 04:40.745
because not to brag, I am
meeting our washing machine

04:40.747 --> 04:44.016
repairman from the home
warranty company tomorrow.

04:44.018 --> 04:46.418
- You're still
dealing with that?

04:46.420 --> 04:48.153
- Yes, for the past six weeks.

04:48.155 --> 04:49.888
- Aren't we just
getting a new washer?

04:51.091 --> 04:54.493
- I will let the Earth
crash into the sun,

04:54.495 --> 04:56.761
before I get a new washer,

04:56.763 --> 04:58.697
they need to fix it,
this is the whole reason

04:58.699 --> 05:00.765
we have a home warranty policy
for this exact scenario.

05:00.767 --> 05:01.966
- That policy is a scam.

05:01.968 --> 05:03.836
- Ooh, a fucking scam

05:03.838 --> 05:06.304
and this is the hill
I am going to die on.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.906
- That's the hill you've chosen?

05:07.908 --> 05:08.773
- Yes!
- Do you remember

05:08.775 --> 05:09.908
when that happened to Travis?

05:09.910 --> 05:11.176
- Yes.
- He ended up having to buy

05:11.178 --> 05:12.244
a whole new fridge.
- Oh my God,

05:12.246 --> 05:14.379
wasn't he so pissed?
- So pissed.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.647
- Who's Travis?

05:15.649 --> 05:17.182
- Travis from the office.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.584
- I've literally never heard
the name, Travis before.

05:19.586 --> 05:20.919
- Yeah, you have, Travis,

05:20.921 --> 05:22.187
he's in the office
right next to me.

05:22.189 --> 05:23.856
- I thought Kelly
was next to you?

05:23.858 --> 05:25.457
- Oh no, since I moved floors.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.259
- When did you move floors?

05:27.261 --> 05:28.927
- Eight months ago.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.529
- You moved floors
eight months ago?

05:30.531 --> 05:32.264
- I did.
- Why didn't you tell me?

05:32.266 --> 05:33.998
- I don't know, I should have.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.600
- Have you guys ever met?

05:35.602 --> 05:37.736
Because I have a feeling you
would totally hit it off.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.271
- I'm telling you right
now, I don't think we would.

05:39.273 --> 05:42.207
- No, no, no, Mike,
Mike, she uses condoms,

05:42.209 --> 05:43.608
so yeah,
- Oh.

05:43.610 --> 05:45.544
- you could do so much
better, I'll find you a lady.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.713
- Thanks.
- You deserve to R-D-I-B.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.717
Raw dog it, bro.
- From behind.

05:53.954 --> 05:56.889
- I just hit a full
house, but I'm gonna fold

05:56.891 --> 05:58.623
after what he just said.

05:58.625 --> 05:59.824
(cheerful upbeat music)

05:59.826 --> 06:02.026
I'll be honest, I don't
love that you and I

06:02.028 --> 06:04.696
have apparently
become strangers,

06:04.698 --> 06:05.964
but not you know, in a cool way

06:05.966 --> 06:07.566
like you work in a hobby shop,

06:07.568 --> 06:09.434
I'm looking for a
specific type of glue,

06:09.436 --> 06:13.171
it's too expensive, you
offer up your own adhesive.

06:13.173 --> 06:15.307
- That's very specific.
- I'm just saying,

06:15.309 --> 06:18.443
I was kind of joking about
the seperate island thing,

06:18.445 --> 06:20.712
but doesn't it seem like
we've been kind of leading

06:20.714 --> 06:25.049
parallel lives recently
without a ton of intersection?

06:25.051 --> 06:26.318
- Yeah, it does,
- Yeah.

06:26.320 --> 06:28.853
- But I think it's because
we've both been slammed lately.

06:28.855 --> 06:31.123
- Mike, you moved
offices eight months ago

06:31.125 --> 06:33.926
next to this alleged Travis.

06:33.928 --> 06:36.528
- Well, at least you get
to meet very real Travis,

06:36.530 --> 06:38.463
before you die of boredom
at my partners' dinner.

06:38.465 --> 06:40.265
- Oh no, I plan on not wearing
a seatbelt to that event

06:40.267 --> 06:42.134
and hope I just get lucky.

06:42.136 --> 06:44.669
Feel free to text a
lot behind the wheel,

06:44.671 --> 06:46.338
if you know what I'm saying.

06:46.340 --> 06:48.140
- Oh, I know what you're saying.

06:48.142 --> 06:51.744
How do we get back on
each other's islands?

06:51.746 --> 06:53.345
- Back on each other islands?

06:53.347 --> 06:56.881
I think honestly we just
have to invite each other

06:56.883 --> 06:59.351
more into our lives.

06:59.353 --> 07:00.819
- That's a lot of arms.
- Yeah,

07:00.821 --> 07:03.288
yeah, didn't love any
of how that came out.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.357
- It's still happening.
- But seriously,

07:05.359 --> 07:08.026
like you know.
- Yeah, no, let's do it.

07:08.028 --> 07:09.294
- Alright, I was gonna
ask you this before,

07:09.296 --> 07:11.229
but I might as well
get some credit for it.

07:11.231 --> 07:15.233
I'm thinking about
getting that IUD put in,

07:15.235 --> 07:16.301
- Hm-mm.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.436
- But I'm a little freaked out.

07:17.438 --> 07:19.704
Will you come with me to get it?

07:19.706 --> 07:20.839
- Of course, I'd be happy to.

07:20.841 --> 07:22.441
- Thank you.
- Hm-mm.

07:22.443 --> 07:25.910
- And my vagina
thanks you as well.

07:25.912 --> 07:29.848
- Well, tell your vagina
I said you're welcome.

07:29.850 --> 07:33.452
- Mike, she's right there,
please tell her yourself,

07:33.454 --> 07:35.587
I can't always be
your go between.

07:35.589 --> 07:36.555
- You're welcome.

07:38.125 --> 07:41.727
- I don't think she heard
you, you're pretty far away.

07:43.464 --> 07:44.263
Hm-mm.

07:45.332 --> 07:46.531
Closer,

07:46.533 --> 07:47.932
closer,

07:47.934 --> 07:49.001
closer,

07:49.003 --> 07:50.469
closer.
- Closer?

07:50.471 --> 07:53.405
- Closer, close, yep,
right about there.

07:53.407 --> 07:55.607
- [Mike] You're welcome.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.576
- I think she felt
that was sincere,

07:58.945 --> 08:00.345
so did I,

08:00.347 --> 08:01.146
yeah, boy.

08:04.552 --> 08:07.453
music)
so did I,

08:12.893 --> 08:14.760
- Mommy, is this gonna hurt?

08:14.762 --> 08:16.962
- No, bubs, they're just
gonna clean your teeth,

08:16.964 --> 08:18.230
make 'em all shiny,

08:18.232 --> 08:21.699
you'll probably get a
cool new toothbrush.

08:21.701 --> 08:25.237
- Well, can I play camera on
your phone, while we wait?

08:25.239 --> 08:29.040
- Oh my God, well, 'cause
you're so scared, yeah,

08:29.042 --> 08:31.443
but for the record, I
know that you're faking it

08:31.445 --> 08:33.111
to get on my phone.

08:33.113 --> 08:36.582
- Ms. Warren.
- Hi, Dr. Fuller, how are you?

08:36.584 --> 08:38.250
- I'm great, good to see you.
- You too,

08:38.252 --> 08:40.852
bubs, you're up,
come on, hurry up.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.788
- Amelia, you ready
to come on back?

08:42.790 --> 08:43.522
- Hm-mm.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.659
Mommy, his breath
doesn't smell like farts.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.862
- What, where did you,
what are you talking about?

08:50.864 --> 08:53.666
- You were texting
Kyle about his breath.

08:55.936 --> 08:58.203
- Oh, no, no, no, that
was a different dentist,

08:58.205 --> 09:00.405
that was my friend,
Kyle's dentist.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.408
He should come to see
you, do you see adults?

09:02.410 --> 09:03.609
- Absolutely.
- Great.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.077
You know, I'm gonna
grab your card,

09:05.079 --> 09:06.878
I think he'll be really happy

09:06.880 --> 09:09.547
to know that that is an option.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.882
(cheerful upbeat music)

09:10.884 --> 09:13.485
I mean, you can do hidden
photo folders, right?

09:13.487 --> 09:14.752
- Yep.

09:14.754 --> 09:15.954
- Can't you just do
that for text chains?

09:15.956 --> 09:17.755
- No, but I'm looking here.

09:17.757 --> 09:19.758
- Oh, it was so embarrassing,

09:19.760 --> 09:22.628
she said his breath
smelled like farts.

09:22.630 --> 09:24.162
Maybe on the bright side,

09:24.164 --> 09:25.763
the dentist will start
brushing his teeth

09:25.765 --> 09:28.233
or figure out what's
going on in his stomach?

09:28.235 --> 09:29.901
- I've gotta say,
I'm pretty impressed

09:29.903 --> 09:30.769
with her reading though.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.838
- Hm, yeah, well, I now get

09:32.840 --> 09:35.173
why the government
doesn't fund education,

09:35.175 --> 09:38.043
they understand the
perils of knowledge.

09:38.045 --> 09:40.979
- Amelia needs to never be
on your phone or computer

09:40.981 --> 09:43.515
or brain, how do you
walk around like this?

09:43.517 --> 09:46.452
- Like a fucking champion.
- Hm-mm.

09:46.454 --> 09:49.187
- I did have to buy her her
own coloring paper though,

09:49.189 --> 09:51.189
she used to draw on the
backs of old scripts of mine.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.125
- Please don't tell
me stuff like that.

09:53.127 --> 09:54.660
- What?
- Seriously?

09:54.662 --> 09:57.129
- Accidentally
reading one dick joke

09:57.131 --> 09:59.797
is not going to scar
our child forever.

09:59.799 --> 10:00.566
- I guess not.

10:02.470 --> 10:04.136
- What about two?

10:05.405 --> 10:07.072
(cheerful upbeat music)

10:07.074 --> 10:08.940
- Is it weird that we're
not gonna see Dr. Satkin?

10:08.942 --> 10:11.009
- No, this happens all the time,

10:11.011 --> 10:13.078
these doctors are
always birthing babies.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.480
- Oh, right, that's
what they do.

10:14.482 --> 10:16.348
- Well, I mean, that's
their side hustle,

10:16.350 --> 10:19.151
so they can afford to do
what they really wanna do,

10:19.153 --> 10:20.219
the Paps.

10:22.022 --> 10:23.489
- Andrea, hello!
- Dr. Goldberg, hi!

10:23.491 --> 10:25.223
- It's been a
while, how are you?

10:25.225 --> 10:26.424
- I'm good, how are you?

10:26.426 --> 10:28.426
- I'm very well.
- Good.

10:28.428 --> 10:29.061
- Steve?

10:30.097 --> 10:31.429
- Oh, my God, Mike.

10:31.431 --> 10:33.165
- Hey, man!
- Wow!

10:33.167 --> 10:34.833
- How are you?
- I'm great, how are you, man?

10:34.835 --> 10:36.101
- What is happening?
- Steve and I

10:36.103 --> 10:37.369
went to camp together.
- What?

10:37.371 --> 10:39.505
- He was my camp counselor.

10:39.507 --> 10:41.173
- Oh, my God, are you serious?

10:41.175 --> 10:42.307
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.641
- How long has it been
since I've seen you?

10:43.643 --> 10:45.511
- 30 years, how about that?

10:45.513 --> 10:47.579
- [Steve] 30 years,
can you believe it?

10:47.581 --> 10:49.781
- You look great.
- You too, man.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.983
- Does he look the same?
- Looks exactly the same,

10:51.985 --> 10:52.851
- You look exactly the same,
- Yeah, 'cause that's what

10:52.853 --> 10:54.052
you're supposed to say, right.

10:54.054 --> 10:55.253
Alright, Andrea,
- That's crazy.

10:55.255 --> 10:56.654
- you're gonna wanna
lie back, scooch forward

10:56.656 --> 10:58.357
and throw those feet on up.
- Okay.

10:59.527 --> 11:00.926
- Now you're gonna
feel a little pressure,

11:00.928 --> 11:02.394
just take a few deep breaths.
- Okay.

11:02.396 --> 11:03.629
- Alright, fine.

11:05.399 --> 11:08.266
These are my fingers,

11:08.268 --> 11:09.601
- Hm-mm.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.203
- and I'm just applying
a little numbing cream.

11:11.205 --> 11:12.604
- Hm-mm.
- Okay.

11:12.606 --> 11:15.607
So are you still in touch
with anyone else from camp?

11:15.609 --> 11:16.875
- No, not really, have you?

11:16.877 --> 11:18.344
I mean, I'm on
Facebook with some.

11:18.346 --> 11:19.811
- Oh, okay, well,
my sister and I

11:19.813 --> 11:21.747
went to the 20 year reunion.
- Oh, my God, you did?

11:21.749 --> 11:23.415
- Yeah, you okay?

11:23.417 --> 11:24.282
- Hm-mm.
- Oh, my God,

11:24.284 --> 11:25.617
how's your sister?

11:25.619 --> 11:29.154
His sister, Alison was my
first kiss, isn't that crazy?

11:29.156 --> 11:30.422
- So crazy.
- I know.

11:30.424 --> 11:31.890
- She's doing great,
- Oh, good.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.092
- by the way, she's an
architect, she has two kids,

11:34.094 --> 11:35.160
- Oh, nice.
- living in Portland.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.762
You're gonna wanna take
a deep breath here.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.230
- That's amazing.
- Ready?

11:38.232 --> 11:40.498
- I hear that the--
- Ooh!

11:40.500 --> 11:42.634
- I hear that they
redid all the cabins?

11:42.636 --> 11:43.701
- Ah-huh.
- Did they?

11:43.703 --> 11:44.836
- Ah-huh.
- How'd it look?

11:44.838 --> 11:46.438
- [Steve] Ah-huh,
it looked great.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.773
- Did they redo that dock?
- No, dock's the same,

11:47.775 --> 11:49.507
a lot of fun.

11:49.509 --> 11:50.776
- Are we--
- Yeah.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.377
- Are we done?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:52.379 --> 11:53.111
- Tell me what it was like
to get back on the lake.

11:53.113 --> 11:54.246
- You know what?

11:54.248 --> 11:55.447
The lake is beautiful.
- Tell me everybody--

11:55.449 --> 11:56.448
- I'm gonna get dressed.
- Okay, great.

11:56.450 --> 11:58.050
- So--
- Was Magnus there?

11:58.052 --> 11:59.851
- Magnus was there.
- Magnus?

11:59.853 --> 12:02.821
- Magnus was.

12:02.823 --> 12:04.222
(cheerful upbeat music)

12:04.224 --> 12:05.623
- I still can't
believe Steve Goldberg

12:05.625 --> 12:07.359
is one of your gynecologists.

12:07.361 --> 12:09.495
- Oh, I don't consider him one
of my gynecologists anymore,

12:09.497 --> 12:10.762
now he's just your buddy,

12:10.764 --> 12:12.898
who sometimes puts
his hand inside me,

12:12.900 --> 12:15.233
but you know, at least
you got to reminisce

12:15.235 --> 12:19.104
with an old friend, so that
was a good day for you.

12:19.106 --> 12:21.039
- Hm, that didn't sound sincere.

12:21.041 --> 12:24.910
- I'm not gonna lie, it
wasn't amazing for me

12:24.912 --> 12:28.113
just spread eagle, while
you guys chitchatted.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.248
- I think it was just a
shock to see him there,

12:30.250 --> 12:33.385
but you're right, that
wasn't the most ideal setting

12:33.387 --> 12:35.387
for a reunion.
- Outside my vagina?

12:35.389 --> 12:37.655
I don't know, I mean, I
have a Pap smear coming up,

12:37.657 --> 12:39.325
if you wanna invite some
of your college friends,

12:39.327 --> 12:41.259
we haven't seen them in a while.

12:41.261 --> 12:43.662
- Okay, why didn't
you say something?

12:44.532 --> 12:46.332
- What was I supposed to say?

12:46.334 --> 12:48.666
Please stop reminiscing,

12:48.668 --> 12:52.070
while you install
hardware into my uterus.

12:52.072 --> 12:54.272
I was aggressively trying
to make eye contact.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.741
- I'm sorry.

12:55.743 --> 12:59.077
- I know, this isn't even
about your obvious obsession

12:59.079 --> 13:03.215
with my gynecologist and
his sister and the dock,

13:03.217 --> 13:04.149
we're just,

13:05.219 --> 13:06.885
we're out of sync,

13:06.887 --> 13:09.287
we're off and I don't love it.

13:09.289 --> 13:10.322
- Yeah, shit.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.291
- Oh God, are we
getting divorced?

13:13.293 --> 13:14.692
Is this the
beginning of the end?

13:14.694 --> 13:16.494
- Hopefully there's
some stops before that.

13:16.496 --> 13:18.230
- Oh, my God, you seem panicked.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.098
- Stop, no.
- You're panicking.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.699
- I am not, but
it might nor hurt

13:21.701 --> 13:23.101
to give the old
therapist a call?

13:23.103 --> 13:24.702
- I mean, I guess
if it's a choice

13:24.704 --> 13:27.439
between therapy and divorce.

13:27.441 --> 13:28.706
- Right.

13:28.708 --> 13:29.841
- But you should
know that I think

13:29.843 --> 13:32.644
the only way I'll truly
be able to move forward,

13:32.646 --> 13:33.711
- Yeah.
- is if Claire ends up

13:33.713 --> 13:35.313
with her hand inside you.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.715
- Mommy, I can't sleep.

13:37.717 --> 13:39.251
- What?

13:39.253 --> 13:41.319
Oh, bubs, come here, maybe
you just need to snuggle.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.187
- Here.
- We'll get back

13:42.189 --> 13:44.990
to the F-I-S-T-I-N-G later.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.592
- Hm-mm.

13:46.594 --> 13:47.393
- Feisting?

13:49.196 --> 13:51.329
- Yes, good job,

13:51.331 --> 13:56.268
feisting, like feisty,
like we were being crazy.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.138
Well, I guess spelling is done.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.541
- Yeah, we had a G-O-O-D run.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.813
- Was that a joke,
like a spelling joke?

14:07.815 --> 14:09.214
- Yeah.

14:09.216 --> 14:12.017
- I don't feel like divorce
is the worst option,

14:12.019 --> 14:14.552
you know what I mean?

14:14.554 --> 14:17.489
Like don't take
it off the table.

14:17.491 --> 14:19.557
(cheerful upbeat music)

14:19.559 --> 14:22.694
I mean, try to get her to bed
by nine, 9:30 at the latest,

14:22.696 --> 14:25.497
otherwise I suffer
tomorrow, when she's a jerk.

14:25.499 --> 14:28.566
- Ooh, 15 ways to stay
thin and keep your booty.

14:28.568 --> 14:29.767
- Oh, Jesus Christ,
give me that.

14:29.769 --> 14:31.837
- Why?
- Because I am throwing out

14:31.839 --> 14:33.238
all objectionable material,

14:33.240 --> 14:35.773
because of my daughter's
newfound love of
the written word.

14:35.775 --> 14:37.375
- Oh, that can't be all
of it in this house.

14:37.377 --> 14:38.644
- Oh God, no, please,

14:38.646 --> 14:40.245
this is the stuff I
would never throw out,

14:40.247 --> 14:42.314
I'm gonna pop it in your
garage, when I do laundry,

14:42.316 --> 14:45.183
you might actually wanna
make a little bit of room,

14:45.185 --> 14:46.452
there's quite a few boxes.

14:46.454 --> 14:48.787
- Your washing machine
still isn't fixed?

14:48.789 --> 14:50.789
- Nope, but I am
currently filing

14:50.791 --> 14:52.190
a small claims
suit against them,

14:52.192 --> 14:53.725
so--
- Honey,

14:53.727 --> 14:55.461
get a new washing machine,
it's been broken for so long.

14:55.463 --> 14:57.463
Mom, it's the
principle of it, okay,

14:57.465 --> 14:59.331
it's about justice,
this is not okay,

14:59.333 --> 15:01.333
I'm paying for a policy.

15:01.335 --> 15:02.868
- What are these?

15:02.870 --> 15:05.603
- Edward Penis hands.
- What?

15:05.605 --> 15:08.073
- Every year at Halloween,
these friends come out to play.

15:08.075 --> 15:10.742
- I should really try to
get custody of Amelia.

15:10.744 --> 15:13.545
- I mean, good luck,
something tells me

15:13.547 --> 15:17.349
I can win over an
all female jury.

15:17.351 --> 15:18.550
- God.
- Mom, muah!

15:18.552 --> 15:21.953
Thank you for staying,
muah, muah, muah!

15:21.955 --> 15:24.756
Alright, I promise it's
not gonna be a late night.

15:24.758 --> 15:27.025
I can only smile at old
lawyers for so long,

15:27.027 --> 15:29.161
before my soul vacates my body.

15:29.163 --> 15:31.029
- It's fine.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.231
Are you putting on lipstick?

15:33.233 --> 15:34.566
- Now, why?

15:34.568 --> 15:37.569
- For your husband, I
always put on lipstick,

15:37.571 --> 15:39.371
before Leon comes
home from work.

15:39.373 --> 15:40.572
- You know what?

15:40.574 --> 15:41.707
Usually I would
tell you to suck it,

15:41.709 --> 15:42.841
but maybe I should
throw on a gloss.

15:42.843 --> 15:44.576
- Why, what happened?

15:44.578 --> 15:47.112
- Nothing, just we're like a
little off kilter right now,

15:47.114 --> 15:48.847
but we're working on it.

15:48.849 --> 15:51.783
- Mike is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

15:51.785 --> 15:55.053
- Wow, better than
your granddaughter?

15:55.055 --> 15:57.289
- Well, Mike did his part
there too, didn't he?

15:58.726 --> 16:02.327
- I don't love how sexily
you refer to his sperm.

16:02.329 --> 16:03.862
- Can't help being sexy.

16:03.864 --> 16:05.331
- Sorry I'm late.
- Hi, perfect timing.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.464
- You ready?
- Yes, please.

16:06.466 --> 16:07.866
- Thanks for staying, Sharon.

16:07.868 --> 16:10.668
- Okay, you guys have fun,
I can stay over if you like,

16:10.670 --> 16:13.071
whatever you need.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.873
- Oh, my God, seriously?

16:14.875 --> 16:17.075
- Don't worry, you came
out smelling like roses,

16:17.077 --> 16:19.077
thank you, Mom.
- Oh, love you, Sharon.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.879
- Gross, put your dick away.

16:20.881 --> 16:23.481
Mom, I'm actually
talking to yours.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.652
(cheerful upbeat music)

16:27.821 --> 16:29.154
- Ken, Linda was
showing us pictures

16:29.156 --> 16:31.623
of your daughter's
wedding, it looked amazing.

16:31.625 --> 16:33.825
- Thank you, she's just become
such a wonderful young woman.

16:33.827 --> 16:35.293
- That's so nice to hear.
- Yeah.

16:35.295 --> 16:37.295
- I love that from a Dad.
- And I have to give Linda

16:37.297 --> 16:38.564
all the credit.

16:38.566 --> 16:40.498
- What are you saying?
- She did all the work.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.499
- Oh.
- I was always

16:41.501 --> 16:43.101
stuck in the office.
- Come on,

16:43.103 --> 16:45.771
that is how we were able to
afford that beautiful wedding.

16:45.773 --> 16:47.839
- Hey, hi!
- Oh my gosh, Becky.

16:47.841 --> 16:50.375
- That is a beautiful top.
- I love that color.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.578
- So you guys have
big plans tonight, hm?

16:52.580 --> 16:53.845
Going dancing?

16:53.847 --> 16:55.313
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Yeah, I wish.

16:55.315 --> 16:57.583
I'm gonna go home and pack.
- Oh, where you going?

16:57.585 --> 16:59.985
- Dan is, he's going for work.

16:59.987 --> 17:02.921
- Oh, that's nice of
you to pack for him.

17:02.923 --> 17:04.390
- Well, if he packed himself,

17:04.392 --> 17:05.724
who knows what he'd end up with.

17:05.726 --> 17:07.926
- I'd end up in Caracas
with four shirts

17:07.928 --> 17:09.995
and not a pair of
pants in sight.

17:09.997 --> 17:12.197
- It's happened before.
- It sounds like it happened.

17:12.199 --> 17:14.532
- You want another drink?
- Yes, I would love one.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.868
- Excuse us, guys.
- Yes, good to see you,

17:16.870 --> 17:18.604
we'll see you out and about.

17:19.539 --> 17:22.007
- So Becky packs Dan's suitcase,

17:22.009 --> 17:23.409
that's a thing.
- Yeah,

17:23.411 --> 17:27.012
and they've been together
forever and seem very happy.

17:27.014 --> 17:28.414
- Wow.
- I'm just saying,

17:28.416 --> 17:31.617
they may be, you know,
horrifying gender stereotypes,

17:31.619 --> 17:34.219
but they are in
sync, look at them.

17:34.221 --> 17:35.887
- That's true, they are.

17:35.889 --> 17:39.491
- Without each other, Dan
would be pantsless in Caracas

17:39.493 --> 17:42.027
and Becky, I assume
would be dead.

17:42.029 --> 17:43.429
- Is that a positive
or a negative?

17:43.431 --> 17:46.965
- I don't know, I'm just
saying most couples by this age

17:46.967 --> 17:48.700
are a disaster, who
else do you know,

17:48.702 --> 17:51.637
who have been together this
long and are that happy?

17:51.639 --> 17:53.772
- That's a good question.

17:53.774 --> 17:56.908
- Nobody but them and my mother.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.910
- Oh, God.
- Ah-huh,

17:58.912 --> 18:02.580
so you ready for a life
of just constant lipstick

18:02.582 --> 18:05.851
and getting fed in bed?
- Not necessarily.

18:05.853 --> 18:07.919
- Well, then tick
tock on this itch.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.122
- Alright, I can get on
board with dinner in bed.

18:10.124 --> 18:12.491
- Fuck you, I will never
give you dinner in bed.

18:13.461 --> 18:16.194
(cheerful upbeat music)

18:16.196 --> 18:18.396
- So she's six, is that
kindergarten or 1st grade?

18:18.398 --> 18:19.731
- Kindergarten.
- Kindergarten?

18:19.733 --> 18:20.999
- Yes, she's having
a great year,

18:21.001 --> 18:22.134
she really, really likes school.

18:22.136 --> 18:23.201
- Loves her teachers.
- Yeah.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.870
- Oh, I'm sorry, no, no, no,

18:24.872 --> 18:27.939
he has sensitive teeth, so he
can't have any ice, thank you.

18:27.941 --> 18:30.208
- [Dan] Thank you, honey.

18:30.210 --> 18:31.543
- I saw that.
- Hm.

18:31.545 --> 18:34.212
- What are kids into at six?
- Six is reading,

18:34.214 --> 18:35.881
she just started reading.
- Oh, so cute.

18:35.883 --> 18:38.016
- Yeah.
- It is cute,

18:38.018 --> 18:39.417
little bit of a downside though,

18:39.419 --> 18:40.285
- I know.
- Yeah.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.553
- now she's reading everything.

18:41.555 --> 18:42.888
- Yeah.

18:42.890 --> 18:44.756
- We have a story
about that, yeah,

18:44.758 --> 18:48.694
Travis, tell them about the
time with Josh and the Playboy.

18:48.696 --> 18:49.895
- Oh, God.
- Oh, right, right, right.

18:49.897 --> 18:52.030
So my brother, as a joke,
- No.

18:52.032 --> 18:53.631
- he got me a
Playboy subscription.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.701
- Yeah, it comes in the mail,
we don't even think about it.

18:55.703 --> 19:00.706
- And it's a Sunday morning
and Josh, our son is 10

19:01.909 --> 19:02.774
and I see him
notice the magazine

19:02.776 --> 19:04.576
out of the corner of his eye

19:04.578 --> 19:07.245
and he starts toward it,

19:07.247 --> 19:09.447
so I take three steps

19:09.449 --> 19:10.982
and I just dive.
(thudding)

19:10.984 --> 19:12.050
- Ooh!
(gasping)

19:12.052 --> 19:13.251
- Ooh, you okay?

19:13.253 --> 19:16.522
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm
fine and so I dove

19:16.524 --> 19:19.658
and I'm trying to get there
before he opens it up, right,

19:20.994 --> 19:21.794
so--
- John,

19:23.864 --> 19:24.863
you're just,
- Bleeding.

19:24.865 --> 19:25.797
- bleeding a little bit.
- Yeah.

19:25.799 --> 19:27.665
- Here, let me just, oh, my God.

19:27.667 --> 19:28.734
- Here, sit back.
- Oh, my God.

19:28.736 --> 19:29.735
- I'll just put some
pressure on that.

19:29.737 --> 19:30.936
- Oh, just.
- I'm okay,

19:30.938 --> 19:32.470
I'm fine, I'm fine.
- I know, you are okay,

19:32.472 --> 19:33.872
we're just gonna
lean your head back.

19:33.874 --> 19:35.073
- Yeah, ooh, there's some blood.

19:35.075 --> 19:36.274
- Oh.
- Is he okay?

19:36.276 --> 19:37.675
- He's gonna be fine.
- Yeah, yeah, no,

19:37.677 --> 19:40.278
it's a head wound, so
you know, there's blood.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.214
I don't think this is--
- Can someone see

19:42.216 --> 19:43.481
if they have towels,
can you get that?

19:43.483 --> 19:44.750
- Yes, you know what?
- Thanks, Dan.

19:44.752 --> 19:46.618
- I need to put some
pressure, I think.

19:46.620 --> 19:47.886
- I will,
- Yeah.

19:47.888 --> 19:49.021
- put pressure, right.
- There we go, yeah.

19:49.023 --> 19:50.622
- Got it.
- There we go, ooh!

19:50.624 --> 19:53.359
- Oh!
- Colleen, will you call 911?

19:53.361 --> 19:54.560
- 911?
- Yeah.

19:54.562 --> 19:58.364
- I think my fingers
are in his head.

19:58.366 --> 20:01.233
- We are pretty much
holding his scalp together.

20:01.235 --> 20:02.434
- Oh!
- Yeah.

20:02.436 --> 20:03.335
- Oh!
- Okay,

20:04.638 --> 20:06.138
are those towels coming?

20:08.375 --> 20:10.442
lleen, he is gonna be fine.

20:10.444 --> 20:12.511
Head wounds always look
worse than they are.

20:12.513 --> 20:14.245
- They bleed, they really do.

20:14.247 --> 20:15.580
- I can't thank you guys enough.

20:15.582 --> 20:17.116
- Oh, my God.

20:17.118 --> 20:19.318
- Should I ride in the ambulance
with him to the hospital?

20:20.587 --> 20:21.987
- Yeah.
- Yes.

20:21.989 --> 20:24.589
- Okay, yeah, thanks again.
- Of course, yes,

20:24.591 --> 20:25.858
let us know what happens.

20:27.194 --> 20:28.660
Thank you.

20:28.662 --> 20:30.462
- That was insane.
- Oh, my God.

20:30.464 --> 20:32.664
- He was like really bleeding.

20:32.666 --> 20:34.199
- No, he was gushing blood,

20:34.201 --> 20:36.135
when our fingers
were in his head,

20:36.137 --> 20:37.736
- Yeah.

20:37.738 --> 20:40.872
- I legitimately felt the
heartbeat behind the blood.

20:40.874 --> 20:43.742
- But obviously poor dress.
- Oh, my God, terrible.

20:43.744 --> 20:47.078
- But we were like in the zone.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.749
- We were locked in, it
was like we were performing

20:50.751 --> 20:53.218
a little dance around his skull.

20:53.220 --> 20:54.486
- Right?
- Maybe this is our thing,

20:54.488 --> 20:56.021
you know what I mean?

20:56.023 --> 20:57.556
Maybe we've figured
out our thing,

20:57.558 --> 20:59.825
maybe whenever we
feel disconnected,

20:59.827 --> 21:01.160
I'll just hit
someone with my car

21:01.162 --> 21:04.095
and then we'll just jam
their broken bones back in.

21:04.097 --> 21:05.697
- Good.
- Thank you.

21:05.699 --> 21:07.432
- It's important to find
opportunities to connect.

21:07.434 --> 21:08.700
- Right.

21:08.702 --> 21:10.235
- I'm really happy
you're here tonight.

21:10.237 --> 21:12.137
- Thank you, I am too.

21:14.241 --> 21:16.842
I guess maybe it's good
that we're not those people,

21:16.844 --> 21:20.111
because if I were Colleen,
you would have bled out,

21:20.113 --> 21:21.180
- Oh, yes.
- to be clear.

21:21.182 --> 21:23.182
- But if I was dead,

21:23.184 --> 21:24.716
at least you'd be able
to realize your dream

21:24.718 --> 21:26.718
of being a widow.
- Mike,

21:26.720 --> 21:28.520
two more years together

21:28.522 --> 21:30.789
and then you die.
- Sorry, right.

21:30.791 --> 21:32.524
- I feel like I've
made that so clear.

21:32.526 --> 21:34.393
- You probably have.

21:34.395 --> 21:37.596
- Oh, my God, you don't think
Travis has hep C, do you?

21:37.598 --> 21:40.465
Because I have some
open cuts on my hand.

21:40.467 --> 21:41.933
- I think Travis and
Colleen are clean.

21:41.935 --> 21:43.535
- I mean, if it was Dan,
- Ooph!

21:43.537 --> 21:46.137
- I'd be more worried,
why is he always trying

21:46.139 --> 21:47.672
to get to Caracas
without his pants?

21:47.674 --> 21:48.940
- I think we know.

21:48.942 --> 21:51.210
- To get a nice base
tan on that dick.

21:53.214 --> 21:54.613
- I'm gonna wash my hands.
- You know what?

21:54.615 --> 21:58.016
I'll come with you, look
how connected we are.

21:58.018 --> 21:59.818
(cheerful upbeat music)

21:59.820 --> 22:02.087
Well, feel free to seek
out another bleeder,

22:02.089 --> 22:04.223
we can wash clothes
all day long.

22:04.225 --> 22:05.824
- Did they actually fix
the washing machine?

22:05.826 --> 22:07.559
I thought it was unfixable.

22:07.561 --> 22:09.628
- Well, turns out of you
threaten legal action,

22:09.630 --> 22:11.362
they can find the part to
fix your washing machine

22:11.364 --> 22:14.633
and they will come out on
a Sunday, the Lord's day.

22:14.635 --> 22:17.436
- Well, congratulations,
your perseverance paid off.

22:17.438 --> 22:18.703
- Thank you.
- Hm.

22:18.705 --> 22:21.172
- I will tell you, I
feel good about this,

22:21.174 --> 22:23.709
I feel like they have learned
some sort of a lesson,

22:23.711 --> 22:25.376
not remotely, but I
feel good about it

22:25.378 --> 22:26.578
and the second he fixed it,

22:26.580 --> 22:28.847
I canceled that
bullshit warranty.

22:28.849 --> 22:30.381
I will say though, kind of feel

22:30.383 --> 22:34.586
like I've won Roe v. Wade again.

22:34.588 --> 22:35.921
- Travis is back
home recovering,

22:35.923 --> 22:37.256
they had to glue his
skin back together.

22:37.258 --> 22:38.523
- Oh, God.
- Yeah,

22:38.525 --> 22:39.791
that was a really
terrible wound.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.861
- It was awful, again,
thrilled we were there.

22:42.863 --> 22:45.264
Hey, ask Travis if he
needs a good gynecologist,

22:45.266 --> 22:47.733
'cause I have a great camp
counselor I could recommend.

22:47.735 --> 22:49.200
- Oh, you do?
- Yeah, you know him.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.202
- Ah-huh.
- Remember that guy,

22:51.204 --> 22:54.205
who was like right up inside?
- Wow.

22:54.207 --> 22:56.742
By the way, how you
feeling down there?

22:56.744 --> 22:59.210
- Really, not terrible, like
a little sore, but okay.

22:59.212 --> 23:00.879
- Where do they even put an IUD?

23:00.881 --> 23:03.548
Does it go on the far wall?

23:03.550 --> 23:05.550
- On the far wall?

23:05.552 --> 23:06.751
What exactly do
you think that it?

23:06.753 --> 23:09.154
- The wall that faces the door.

23:09.156 --> 23:10.822
- What?

23:10.824 --> 23:13.558
- You know, you're standing
with your back to the wall,

23:13.560 --> 23:14.960
you're facing the door.

23:14.962 --> 23:17.896
- Then what's behind the wall?

23:17.898 --> 23:19.164
- Your butt?

23:19.166 --> 23:20.765
- My butt?

23:20.767 --> 23:22.768
- Yeah, your butt or your tummy?

23:22.770 --> 23:24.636
- How do we even have a child?

23:24.638 --> 23:27.572
- Oh, I didn't know
if it was like a,

23:27.574 --> 23:29.374
tilted in there, is it tilted?

23:29.376 --> 23:30.642
- Is what tilted,
what is this part?

23:30.644 --> 23:33.244
- This is it, this is the.
- The what?

23:33.246 --> 23:34.013
- The.

23:35.382 --> 23:39.384
- Oh, this has been
delightful, thank you.

23:39.386 --> 23:42.688
(cheerful upbeat music)

23:48.129 --> 23:49.928
- Are we gonna get a
front load washer or--

23:49.930 --> 23:51.130
- Please stop talking.

23:51.132 --> 23:52.398
- Okay.
- Hm-mm.

23:54.201 --> 23:57.736
- Mommy, what are squirt girls?

23:57.738 --> 24:00.339
- What are squirt girls?

24:00.341 --> 24:01.173
- On that car.

24:03.744 --> 24:04.810
- Oh!

24:04.812 --> 24:06.678
You know what?

24:06.680 --> 24:11.517
Those are fancy ladies,
who sell water guns.

24:12.686 --> 24:13.685
- Can we get some?
- No,

24:13.687 --> 24:17.088
they're very
expensive water guns,

24:17.090 --> 24:19.425
you have to buy
them by the minute.

24:22.229 --> 24:24.429
So happy we stopped spelling.

24:24.431 --> 24:25.697
- Yeah.

24:25.699 --> 24:28.334
- Also, why is that a .org?
