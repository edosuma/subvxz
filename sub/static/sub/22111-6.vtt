WEBVTT

00:04.738 --> 00:06.740
(birds chirping)

00:08.742 --> 00:11.512
If the coyotes
don't kill us,

00:11.545 --> 00:12.546
my dad will.

00:12.580 --> 00:14.148
Coyotes don't kill people.

00:14.182 --> 00:16.084
People kill people.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.419
People, like murderers?

00:18.452 --> 00:21.055
We're about five minutes away
from being an episode

00:21.089 --> 00:23.624
on 48 Hours.
BOY: You know what?
Just find my dad's drone,

00:23.657 --> 00:25.559
and we're out of here.

00:25.593 --> 00:28.662
Guys? I don't like this.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.532
I'm getting a very strong
spirit vibe right now.

00:31.565 --> 00:33.201
There's no such thing
as spirits.

00:33.234 --> 00:35.236
Spoken like a true carnivore.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.205
What does that have
to do with anything?

00:37.238 --> 00:39.807
I gave up meat so I could be
more in touch with my senses.

00:39.840 --> 00:43.077
Ha. You gave up meat because
Demi Lovato gave up meat.

00:43.111 --> 00:45.479
Not all heroes
wear capes.

00:45.513 --> 00:47.248
BOY:
Guys, I found it!

00:50.184 --> 00:52.553
Shh. The spirits
might hear us.

00:52.586 --> 00:53.421
BOY:
You know what?

00:53.454 --> 00:55.589
Both of you guys
are being ridiculous.

00:55.623 --> 00:56.657
There's nobody...
(gunshots)

00:56.690 --> 00:58.259
MAN: Don't let
him get away!

00:58.292 --> 01:00.261
MAN 2:
Stop it!

01:00.294 --> 01:01.395
(gunshots, man grunts)

01:01.429 --> 01:03.097
Drop your weapon!

01:03.131 --> 01:04.132
(two gunshots)

01:10.638 --> 01:12.640
*

01:30.858 --> 01:32.693
Miss Footwork.

01:32.726 --> 01:35.129
People who
leave voicemails.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.564
Oh, God, no,
I hate it.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.132
Write a text like
everybody else.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.233
(both grunting)

01:39.267 --> 01:40.868
Ah. Good job.

01:40.901 --> 01:42.603
Mm-hmm.
All right.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.905
People who constantly
clear their throat.

01:44.938 --> 01:47.175
That's disgusting.
Just cough it up already.

01:47.208 --> 01:48.276
(grunts)
Exactly.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.710
(both yell)

01:49.743 --> 01:51.279
Lovely.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.580
All right.

01:52.613 --> 01:54.148
One word...

01:54.182 --> 01:55.516
"manspreaders."

01:55.549 --> 01:56.750
Nope.

01:56.784 --> 01:57.885
Your turn.
Ah.

01:57.918 --> 01:59.420
And I probably
hate that the most.

01:59.453 --> 02:00.654
(smacks lips)
You know,

02:00.688 --> 02:02.323
I don't think
I have any pet peeves.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.158
I'm a pretty tolerant...

02:04.192 --> 02:05.726
person, so...
Really?

02:05.759 --> 02:06.727
Yeah.
We'll see about that.

02:06.760 --> 02:07.795
All right.

02:07.828 --> 02:08.929
Seriously.

02:08.962 --> 02:11.732
I was even voted "most patient"
in high school, so...

02:11.765 --> 02:13.501
People who chew
with their mouth open.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.536
That could be a
health concern, right?

02:15.569 --> 02:17.405
Yep.
(chuckles)

02:17.438 --> 02:19.507
People who hold
their eye contact too long.

02:19.540 --> 02:21.709
They are the windows
to the soul.

02:21.742 --> 02:23.211
Okay.
Eh.

02:23.244 --> 02:24.077
(giggles)
Got another one for you.

02:24.111 --> 02:25.846
Ooh, ooh, ooh,
come on, come on, come on.

02:25.879 --> 02:28.849
Those who use the same password

02:28.882 --> 02:30.851
for all their online accounts.

02:30.884 --> 02:31.785
Get mad.

02:31.819 --> 02:34.822
They are living
a life of... risk!
(grunts)

02:34.855 --> 02:36.357
(exhaling sharply)

02:36.390 --> 02:38.559
(grunts, then groans)

02:38.592 --> 02:39.860
Ah!

02:39.893 --> 02:41.829
She got mad,
ladies and gentlemen.

02:41.862 --> 02:44.798
Looks like patience is no longer
one of Miss Jones' virtues.

02:44.832 --> 02:48.736
Nothing offends me more
than laissez-faire attitude

02:48.769 --> 02:49.970
toward Internet
security. Okay?

02:50.003 --> 02:51.605
Your knife skills
are getting good.

02:51.639 --> 02:52.706
(phone chimes)

02:52.740 --> 02:53.741
Thanks, lady.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.711
Is everything okay?

02:57.745 --> 02:59.880
Um... yeah.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.650
It's, uh...
Deeks is gonna be late again.

03:02.683 --> 03:04.285
He has to meet
with Detective Whiting.

03:04.318 --> 03:05.953
Did he say why?

03:05.986 --> 03:07.221
Uh, no.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.757
He's pretty vague about it.

03:09.790 --> 03:11.459
Leaving out
important information.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.926
I hate that.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.462
(breathes deeply)

03:14.495 --> 03:16.497
Would you say
it's one of your pet peeves?

03:16.530 --> 03:17.731
Oh. I see what you did there.

03:17.765 --> 03:20.634
(laughing)
Okay, okay, okay.

03:20.668 --> 03:21.869
(chuckles)
Good job today.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.237
Thank you.

03:23.271 --> 03:25.273
(whistling)

03:29.877 --> 03:31.679
Ca-caw!

03:36.717 --> 03:38.752
Extreme drop
in body temperature.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.989
A little shortness of breath.

03:42.022 --> 03:44.525
General feeling of malaise.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.394
So, either...

03:46.427 --> 03:48.996
I'm coming down
with the scurvy or...

03:49.029 --> 03:50.564
Oh!

03:50.598 --> 03:52.032
It's good to see you,
too, Deeks.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.233
You know,
in order for distance

03:53.267 --> 03:55.536
to make the heart grow fonder,
I think you're gonna need to

03:55.569 --> 03:56.937
give me a little more distance.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.672
Thank you for meeting me.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.574
Well, you sounded
very urgent.

04:00.608 --> 04:01.909
Don't tell me your
synchronized swimming partner

04:01.942 --> 04:03.444
fell ill,
you need me to suit up.

04:03.477 --> 04:05.679
Cute. But this is serious.

04:05.713 --> 04:08.549
Well, I personally take
the aquatic arts very seriously,

04:08.582 --> 04:09.483
but all right, fire away.

04:09.517 --> 04:11.919
Take a look at this.

04:11.952 --> 04:13.587
MAN (on video):
Police! Drop your weapon!

04:13.621 --> 04:16.424
(sighs deeply)
(gunshots over tablet)

04:20.494 --> 04:22.463
Well, that's not good.
No,

04:22.496 --> 04:24.365
it's not.

04:24.398 --> 04:26.500
It's your old pal,
Lieutenant Bates

04:26.534 --> 04:28.736
Killed a fellow cop
this morning.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.038
Looks like the two of you have
another thing in common now.

04:31.071 --> 04:32.606
Wow. Too soon.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.342
Also, just like in my case,

04:34.375 --> 04:35.609
there's got to be more
to that story

04:35.643 --> 04:38.379
'cause you and I both know that
Bates is one of the good ones.

04:38.412 --> 04:41.014
Well, video says otherwise.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.883
I told you IA
was investigating him.

04:42.916 --> 04:44.718
Yeah, but you never told me why.

04:44.752 --> 04:46.720
We have reason to believe
LAPD's got quite a few officers

04:46.754 --> 04:48.922
moonlighting as
private contractors.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.090
That's not illegal.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.892
It is if they're
breaking the law.

04:53.361 --> 04:55.629
And you think that Bates
is one of these dirty cops?

04:55.663 --> 04:58.065
Looks like Bates is running
the whole racket.

04:59.099 --> 05:00.668
Who's with him?

05:00.701 --> 05:03.604
Some witness LAPD had stashed
in a safe house.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.439
Not sure what Bates
wanted with him.

05:06.507 --> 05:08.642
Well, you're right,
this is serious.

05:08.676 --> 05:12.513
And... I wish you
the best of luck with it.

05:12.546 --> 05:14.348
When your schedule clears up,
maybe you should call me.

05:14.382 --> 05:16.417
We can get together,
start a book club.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.486
I don't think so, Deeks.
Well, then you're just gonna
have to believe me when I say

05:18.519 --> 05:19.720
that we're all in the bell jar.

05:19.753 --> 05:20.954
Deeks.

05:22.890 --> 05:24.858
Bates trusts you.

05:24.892 --> 05:26.694
You're gonna get in touch
with him

05:26.727 --> 05:27.895
and convince him
to turn himself in.

05:27.928 --> 05:30.864
Listen, I am not gonna help you
throw Bates under the bus.

05:30.898 --> 05:33.534
And if I get anywhere near this,
I put myself at risk.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.536
You don't help me,
there's no risk.

05:35.569 --> 05:38.005
I'll make sure everyone knows
you killed your ex-partner.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.144
(chuckles)

05:44.177 --> 05:46.447
Wow.
(sniffs)

05:46.480 --> 05:48.716
Have I, uh...

05:48.749 --> 05:50.584
have I told you
how much I missed you?

05:50.618 --> 05:51.885
No.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.754
This is why.

05:56.490 --> 05:57.791
Just one night.

05:57.825 --> 05:58.526
Two of us out on the town.

05:58.559 --> 06:00.661
No talk of work,
no talk of life.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.929
Good old-fashioned fun.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.130
I don't think I'm up for it.

06:03.163 --> 06:04.932
Did I mention whiskey?

06:04.965 --> 06:06.834
Lots and lots of whiskey.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.702
We really should be
cutting back on the whiskey.

06:08.736 --> 06:09.703
Says who?

06:09.737 --> 06:11.772
The Japanese.
What?

06:11.805 --> 06:13.874
Scientists did a study
of people in Okinawa.

06:13.907 --> 06:15.776
They're amongst
the oldest living on the planet.

06:15.809 --> 06:17.645
They don't drink.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.912
We could learn from them.

06:18.946 --> 06:20.714
Not interested.

06:20.748 --> 06:22.416
Why's everybody trying to
find the fountain of youth?

06:22.450 --> 06:24.485
We're not meant to grow old.

06:24.518 --> 06:26.420
We're finally at the point
where we can understand aging.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.555
I'm all for
taking advantage of it.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.823
I tell you what I'll do:
I'll go easy on the drinking,

06:29.857 --> 06:31.959
I'll go heavy on the Flintstones
Chewables and on the tai chi.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.093
Anything else?

06:34.027 --> 06:35.563
Find your purpose.

06:35.596 --> 06:36.730
Is there a reward if I do?

06:36.764 --> 06:38.699
Like a yoga mat
and some kombucha?

06:38.732 --> 06:39.867
(chuckles)

06:39.900 --> 06:41.502
Your reward is, uh,

06:41.535 --> 06:43.504
an average of 15 more years
of living.

06:43.537 --> 06:44.972
Yeah, but it's the end of
our lives when we're old.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.807
If I'm getting 15 more years,
I want it in my 20s.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.109
Okay, what is
your purpose?

06:51.812 --> 06:53.447
Stay strong for my kids.

06:54.482 --> 06:56.617
Cannot make fun of that.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.151
I'm gonna get back to you
on my purpose.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.220
Yeah?
I think you better hurry up

07:00.253 --> 07:01.955
'cause something tells me
"Bealbo" Baggins

07:01.989 --> 07:04.658
will be down here soon to
take us on a quest of his own.

07:10.998 --> 07:12.533
Drive, now.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.702
You kiss your Uber driver
with that mouth?

07:14.735 --> 07:16.670
Shut up, Deeks.
We need to move, now.

07:16.704 --> 07:17.705
All right, Nancy.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.108
You saw it happen
this morning.

07:21.141 --> 07:22.109
You know I did.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.243
And it looks bad.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.578
You know it does.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.813
Don't worry,
we'll figure it out.

07:25.846 --> 07:26.814
Whiting's gonna help us.

07:26.847 --> 07:29.817
Whiting wouldn't help
a kitten stuck in a tree,

07:29.850 --> 07:32.586
unless she thought she could
shoot it without any witnesses.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.988
Well, cats are notoriously
evil and hard to trust,

07:35.022 --> 07:36.724
so I guess I'm with
team Whiting on that one.

07:36.757 --> 07:37.758
(siren wailing)

07:41.562 --> 07:42.763
You son of a bitch.

07:42.796 --> 07:43.764
You set me up.

07:43.797 --> 07:44.865
What are you
talking about, man?

07:44.898 --> 07:46.600
I didn't call them.

07:46.634 --> 07:48.235
You don't understand
what's going down.

07:48.268 --> 07:50.771
You pull this truck over,
it doesn't end well.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.941
Wow, you've gotten very dramatic
in your old age.

07:53.974 --> 07:55.643
Looks like we're
doing it this way now.

07:55.676 --> 07:56.677
Drive.

08:00.681 --> 08:02.850
You're a lot scarier
without that mustache.

08:02.883 --> 08:04.017
All right, hold on.

08:06.920 --> 08:08.789
(engine revving)

08:11.592 --> 08:12.960
That's not gonna be good

08:12.993 --> 08:14.494
for the resale.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.007
Kens, back me up.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.042
We're cut from
the same cloth, right?

08:29.076 --> 08:30.944
We're rebels.
We're not meant to grow old,

08:30.978 --> 08:32.646
you and me.
KENSI:
Mm.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.047
Sorry. I'm gonna live till 90.

08:34.081 --> 08:35.182
I kind of got plans.

08:35.215 --> 08:36.183
Oh, yeah? You have plans?

08:36.216 --> 08:37.184
With who?

08:37.217 --> 08:38.752
Yours truly.

08:38.786 --> 08:40.187
We're doing a
nonagenarian tour

08:40.220 --> 08:41.221
of all ballparks.

08:41.254 --> 08:42.690
Ballparks?

08:42.723 --> 08:43.957
Do either of you
even like baseball?

08:43.991 --> 08:45.759
No, but I really
like hot dogs.

08:45.793 --> 08:46.960
Those things will kill you.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.697
Which is exactly why I only plan
on eating them when I'm 90.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.864
Deeks know about
this little plan?

08:50.898 --> 08:51.965
No, of course not.

08:51.999 --> 08:53.767
I mean,
he won't even be around anymore.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.803
He's from the weaker
Scandinavian stock, so...

08:55.836 --> 08:57.938
(tablet beeps)
Speaking of...

08:59.607 --> 09:01.008
Mm-hmm?

09:04.712 --> 09:06.079
Do we need to reboot him, or...?

09:06.113 --> 09:07.781
This is not good.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.650
Eric, just... speak.

09:11.051 --> 09:13.987
LAPD put out a BOLO
on Deeks' truck.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.856
NELL: Oh!
CALLEN: Geez.

09:15.889 --> 09:18.191
(line ringing)

09:18.225 --> 09:20.360
DEEKS (on voicemail):
This is Deeks.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.596
Why don't you just text me,
like a normal human being?

09:22.630 --> 09:23.864
KENSI:
He's not answering his phone.

09:23.897 --> 09:25.666
Do we have another angle there?
Yeah.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.700
(tablet beeping)

09:28.368 --> 09:30.037
SAM:
There.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.072
NELL:
That's Lieutenant Bates.

09:32.105 --> 09:33.907
CALLEN: Why was Deeks
meeting with Bates?

09:33.941 --> 09:35.876
He wasn't, he was supposed
to be meeting with Whiting

09:35.909 --> 09:36.710
in the boatshed.

09:36.744 --> 09:38.912
He has a meeting
in Internal Affairs;

09:38.946 --> 09:40.347
an hour later,
he rams a squad car

09:40.380 --> 09:42.883
with his LAPD lieutenant
riding shotgun?

09:43.917 --> 09:45.953
It's not a
coincidence.

09:45.986 --> 09:47.888
Wait, there's more.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.958
This morning, there was a
shooting in Santa Clarita.

09:50.991 --> 09:51.959
Bates is the prime suspect.

09:51.992 --> 09:54.061
SAM: So Whiting needs
Deeks to bring Bates in.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.864
But not surprisingly,
things didn't go as planned.

09:56.897 --> 09:57.998
Where is he now?

09:58.031 --> 09:59.833
Uh, I tracked
Deeks' phone

09:59.867 --> 10:01.802
to a garage in Mid-City,

10:01.835 --> 10:04.171
but I lose the signal
once they enter.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.939
Sam and I will go
look at the garage.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.675
Talk to Whiting and
see what she knows.

10:07.708 --> 10:10.043
I'm not talking to Whiting,
Deeks is not with her.

10:10.077 --> 10:11.645
He's in that garage,
so that's where I'm going.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.046
Okay, fine.
Take Nell with you.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.982
Thank you.
Let's go.
Okay.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.784
Be careful.
Yeah.

10:24.191 --> 10:25.693
SAM:
Detective Whiting.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.127
Yeah, I need to see
you two like I need

10:27.160 --> 10:27.961
a hole in the neck.

10:27.995 --> 10:30.063
Promise you that was
a one-time thing.

10:30.097 --> 10:32.332
It's good to see you're back
to the old Whiting.

10:32.365 --> 10:37.104
Well, turns out my resting
heart rate is stone-cold bitch.

10:37.137 --> 10:40.941
Sounds like Internal Affairs
is gonna have a busy week.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.843
SAM: Yeah,
something tells me

10:42.876 --> 10:44.077
one of your own shoots a cop,

10:44.111 --> 10:45.345
it doesn't happen
out of the blue.
No.

10:45.378 --> 10:47.781
We've been investigating
Bates for a while.

10:47.815 --> 10:49.182
Investigating him for what?

10:50.450 --> 10:52.019
There are rumors that Bates
is running a racket

10:52.052 --> 10:54.221
within LAPD.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.889
Don't ask for details,
I won't give 'em.

10:57.124 --> 10:59.192
Police report said that
Bates took a hostage.

10:59.226 --> 11:00.260
Who is it?

11:00.293 --> 11:04.097
A guy named Simon Atwater.

11:06.033 --> 11:08.101
He's a bioengineer for
Dexmont Agricultural.

11:08.135 --> 11:10.070
Some kind of witness.

11:10.103 --> 11:12.072
Bates was supposed to be
up there interviewing him.

11:12.105 --> 11:14.241
We need to figure out
why Bates wanted him.

11:14.274 --> 11:16.143
May be nothing.

11:16.176 --> 11:17.377
Could be the IA
investigation--

11:17.410 --> 11:18.846
all the pressure made him snap.

11:18.879 --> 11:20.748
Could be that Bates was hired
to silence him.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.250
Either way, it does not explain
why you dragged Deeks into this.

11:25.052 --> 11:27.254
You think there's a chance
that Bates is being set up?

11:27.287 --> 11:30.791
I think there's a chance that
this goes deeper than Bates.

11:30.824 --> 11:33.226
He likes Deeks.
God knows why.

11:33.260 --> 11:35.028
I'm sure it's a Spicoli
fetish or something,

11:35.062 --> 11:37.064
so I asked Deeks to
help me figure it out.

11:37.097 --> 11:38.732
I'm guessing you did more
than just ask him.

11:38.766 --> 11:41.234
Deeks and I have
an arrangement.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.138
Well, now we have
an arrangement.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.941
We'll help you find Bates, but
you got to keep us in the loop.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.977
I have nightmares of Deeks
friending me on Facebook.

11:50.010 --> 11:52.145
Doesn't mean I don't
want him safe.

11:52.179 --> 11:53.213
I'll be in touch.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.451
Is that really
necessary?

11:58.485 --> 12:00.854
Deeks would nave have
fled that squad car.

12:00.888 --> 12:02.222
I don't know
what's necessary.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.256
All right.

12:10.197 --> 12:11.198
Yeah.

12:20.507 --> 12:22.009
They're gone.

12:22.042 --> 12:24.211
Well...

12:24.244 --> 12:25.478
I think I figured out
why they lost signal

12:25.512 --> 12:27.781
when they entered
the garage.

12:27.815 --> 12:29.950
(exhales)
That's not good.

12:29.983 --> 12:32.352
LAPD has things on Deeks
they can use against him.

12:32.385 --> 12:34.021
What kind of things?

12:34.054 --> 12:36.990
Things that we shouldn't
let surface.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.859
We gotta find him
before LAPD does.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.193
Let's go.

12:41.328 --> 12:42.930
I'm gonna tell you
everything.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.332
I just need to make sure
I can trust you.

12:45.365 --> 12:47.200
Well, nothing screams out
"safe place"

12:47.234 --> 12:49.269
like being pushed through
a warehouse at gunpoint.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.038
Well, I knew something
was off when those cops

12:51.071 --> 12:52.372
showed up to take over
the interview.

12:52.405 --> 12:53.373
Yeah, why were they
shooting at you?

12:53.406 --> 12:55.375
Because they wanted to
be alone with my witness,

12:55.408 --> 12:57.911
until I went back
and screwed up their plan.

12:57.945 --> 13:00.948
Why don't you just
tell me what's happening?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.449
Sometimes you gotta
do a bad thing

13:02.482 --> 13:05.018
to make people listen.

13:05.052 --> 13:06.486
Open it.

13:15.195 --> 13:17.330
All right,
I'm definitely listening.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.988
Oh, wow.

13:41.021 --> 13:43.190
I don't really know
how to thank you.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.292
I mean, I guess I could start
by just saying thank you.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.426
So, thank you.

13:46.459 --> 13:47.928
God, shut up, Simon.

13:47.961 --> 13:49.196
So stupid,
it's so stupid.

13:49.229 --> 13:51.131
Well, you're a Chatty Cathy
now, aren't you?

13:51.164 --> 13:52.199
In all fairness, though,
I guess it's

13:52.232 --> 13:54.134
a good trait to have
in a witness.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.169
Sorry, I, um...
I ramble when I'm nervous.

13:56.203 --> 13:58.238
No, no, no, you're,
uh, you're fine.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.339
You're doing good, kid.

13:59.372 --> 14:00.407
Thank you.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.075
Let's cut the crap.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.143
I think it's
pretty obvious

14:03.176 --> 14:04.044
which one of us
is the officer

14:04.077 --> 14:04.978
and which one of us
is the gentleman.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.280
I've had kidney stones
that passed easier

14:07.314 --> 14:08.015
than time with you.

14:08.048 --> 14:10.217
Listen--
Mommy and Daddy fight.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.252
The important thing to remember
is it's not about you.

14:12.285 --> 14:13.921
BATES:
Let's talk.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.456
Where should I start?
Try the beginning.

14:16.489 --> 14:19.359
Sure. Sure.

14:20.593 --> 14:22.295
So, I became
a bioengineer.

14:22.329 --> 14:23.530
Now, I-I don't...
I don't have to, like,

14:23.563 --> 14:26.333
know people, but I do...
I get to help them.

14:26.366 --> 14:28.501
Dexmont Agricultural
does good things.

14:28.535 --> 14:30.570
We make herbicide-resistant
plants

14:30.603 --> 14:33.106
so we can grow endless amounts
of food for more people.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.575
But recently, my focus has been
on terminator genes.

14:35.608 --> 14:37.945
Now, they self-destruct
after each season.

14:37.978 --> 14:39.947
Now, some think
that's unethical,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.481
but, um, Dexmont's been
struggling financially.

14:41.514 --> 14:43.416
You know, we need
repeat customers.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.384
Is there a way
we can speed this up?

14:44.417 --> 14:46.353
I need to get home soon
so I can reconsider

14:46.386 --> 14:47.620
all my life choices.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.556
Yeah, um, so a few weeks ago,

14:49.589 --> 14:51.324
I was working with
agrobacteria,

14:51.358 --> 14:53.160
which transports DNA
to root cells.

14:53.193 --> 14:56.029
I insert herbicide-resistant
DNA into the agrobacteria,

14:56.063 --> 14:57.397
and it inserts those genes
into the plant.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.599
But I...
I messed up.

14:59.632 --> 15:03.470
Now, I don't know
how it happened,

15:03.503 --> 15:06.206
but I...
I contaminated the DNA

15:06.239 --> 15:10.143
with a terminator gene
that just overtook the plants.

15:10.177 --> 15:13.313
And... it was like a cancer.

15:13.346 --> 15:15.015
I mean, what I created
turned out to be

15:15.048 --> 15:17.985
this aggressive and
highly destructive plant virus.

15:18.018 --> 15:20.287
Okay, then just to clarify,

15:20.320 --> 15:23.623
like, how... how dangerous
ar-ar-are we talking here?

15:23.656 --> 15:28.161
The potential for harm
is... immeasurable.

15:28.195 --> 15:31.331
Now, in the wrong hands, this
could be recreated en masse,

15:31.364 --> 15:33.166
dropped on our farms,

15:33.200 --> 15:35.468
and used to wipe out
our entire food supply

15:35.502 --> 15:36.469
in just a matter of weeks.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.537
Did you destroy it?

15:37.570 --> 15:41.741
Well, so I reported it
to my boss, Ryan Wallace.

15:41.774 --> 15:45.045
Now, he confiscated it
and said that that was protocol,

15:45.078 --> 15:47.380
but something just
didn't feel right.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.116
And so I went back
later to check,

15:49.149 --> 15:51.484
and that's when I saw
Mr. Wallace leaving with it.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.520
And that's why you
contacted LAPD?

15:53.553 --> 15:55.488
Wallace must have
a connection inside

15:55.522 --> 15:56.423
that tipped him off.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.191
Who does he know?

15:58.225 --> 16:02.495
Dexmont gets a lot of threats
from anti-GMO groups,

16:02.529 --> 16:05.732
and Mr. Wallace sometimes uses
off-duty cops for security.

16:05.765 --> 16:07.400
Whiting thinks the guys
at the house

16:07.434 --> 16:09.202
were just contractors,
but Wallace would have to know

16:09.236 --> 16:10.537
the head of the whole operation.

16:10.570 --> 16:12.572
Well, word on the street says
that's me.

16:12.605 --> 16:14.141
Well, based on that suit,
it's pretty obvious

16:14.174 --> 16:15.475
that no one's paying you off.

16:15.508 --> 16:18.445
But buying LAPD,
making 'em dirty

16:18.478 --> 16:20.480
isn't cheap, and that virus
could probably get big money

16:20.513 --> 16:21.714
from a rogue nation.

16:21.748 --> 16:24.417
So the only question is, have
they already found a buyer?

16:26.553 --> 16:30.157
Oh, and, uh, Simon...
you did good.

16:31.324 --> 16:33.293
You did okay.

16:35.495 --> 16:37.464
This is bigger
than we thought it was.

16:37.497 --> 16:39.266
Agriculture's
a trillion-dollar business.

16:39.299 --> 16:41.534
They attack our food supply,
they could cripple the economy.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.103
Yeah, well, we need
to find Simon's boss

16:43.136 --> 16:45.138
before he sells it,
assuming he hasn't already.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.539
Well, not so fast.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.641
You're gonna need to
run this one man down.

16:48.675 --> 16:49.809
Deeks and I need to
find some dirty cops.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.379
That's not our priority
right now.

16:52.412 --> 16:53.313
Well, allow me to remind you

16:53.346 --> 16:54.647
that you wouldn't know
about any of this

16:54.681 --> 16:55.748
if it wasn't for me.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.250
And I can pull Deeks
off of your team

16:57.284 --> 16:58.485
anytime I want to.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.388
Okay, I don't think
that's necessary.

17:01.421 --> 17:03.256
Listen, why don't I just
stay here with Bates?

17:03.290 --> 17:04.524
The cops at the house,
we think they're somehow

17:04.557 --> 17:06.293
affiliated with Simon's boss,

17:06.326 --> 17:08.328
we'll work it from both angles--
how's that?

17:10.163 --> 17:12.532
Fine. Keep us posted.

17:12.565 --> 17:15.602
I'll have Eric get us
access to Dexmont.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.170
Yeah, okay.
All right, listen.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.671
A little postgame
wrap-up here.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.507
So, good show.
Like what you did there

17:20.540 --> 17:22.275
with the whole
tough-guy routine,

17:22.309 --> 17:24.711
but probably don't try that
with the big boss.

17:24.744 --> 17:26.613
Ah, well,
thanks for the tip,

17:26.646 --> 17:28.581
but, uh, I don't plan on ever
getting close enough

17:28.615 --> 17:31.351
to that tiny lady to find out.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.752
Oh, so that's...
Okay.

17:59.646 --> 18:03.783
I thought, uh,
maybe you'd gone home.

18:03.816 --> 18:05.785
(laughs)

18:11.691 --> 18:12.892
What?

18:12.925 --> 18:15.428
Even the monks smoking.

18:23.703 --> 18:26.606
The road to
enlightenment

18:26.639 --> 18:28.441
isn't easy.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.578
This from a woman
who can drink most men

18:31.611 --> 18:32.712
under the table.

18:32.745 --> 18:35.782
Nobody's perfect.

18:37.250 --> 18:41.721
So, uh, you abandon
Keane again?

18:44.324 --> 18:48.195
Mr. Keane died in
a helicopter crash.

18:48.228 --> 18:50.797
What about the man
I show you?

18:50.830 --> 18:52.499
I've no idea.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.801
(chuckles, sniffs)

18:54.834 --> 18:56.803
So why are you still here?

18:56.836 --> 19:00.907
Because it's peaceful,

19:00.940 --> 19:03.843
and because I'm in
need of a vacation.

19:03.876 --> 19:07.847
Keane said you two
were transporting

19:07.880 --> 19:10.783
almost a million dollars
in gold bar

19:10.817 --> 19:13.653
when you crash.

19:13.686 --> 19:15.855
It was never recovered.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.390
(sighs)

19:19.726 --> 19:23.296
Okay, well,

19:23.330 --> 19:26.333
you may be content
sitting here,

19:26.366 --> 19:30.937
contemplating the sound
of one hand clapping,

19:30.970 --> 19:32.972
but we got business.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.441
(groans)

19:35.775 --> 19:38.278
Let's go.

19:44.851 --> 19:47.320
Thank you, Brother Bao.

19:51.258 --> 19:54.794
And for the
record, Mr. Dang,

19:54.827 --> 19:59.232
I already know the sound
of one hand clapping.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.969
(groans)

20:15.582 --> 20:17.016
What do you got,
Eric?

20:17.049 --> 20:18.518
Ryan Wallace.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.019
Founder and CEO

20:20.052 --> 20:21.153
of Dexmont Agricultural.

20:21.187 --> 20:23.956
He might want to take
a refresher course in finance.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.458
Dexmont is
hemorrhaging money.

20:25.492 --> 20:27.327
Plus, there are two
outstanding lawsuits

20:27.360 --> 20:28.328
against them for
patent infringement.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.396
What kind of patent?

20:29.429 --> 20:31.798
Genetically modified
seed strains.

20:31.831 --> 20:32.999
Apparently,
they've been stealing

20:33.032 --> 20:33.866
the intellectual property

20:33.900 --> 20:35.802
of much larger
agricultural companies

20:35.835 --> 20:37.370
and trying to pass them off
as their own.

20:37.404 --> 20:39.439
So Dexmont is bankrupt and
they're about to pay out

20:39.472 --> 20:41.040
a huge amount in
settlement fees.

20:41.073 --> 20:44.311
Mm. That's enough reason
to believe Ryan Wallace

20:44.344 --> 20:46.513
would've sold
Simon's crop-killing virus--

20:46.546 --> 20:47.747
to stay afloat.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.616
Send the address for
Dexmont to our phones.

20:49.649 --> 20:50.617
We got to move.

20:50.650 --> 20:51.651
See you in a bit.

20:55.455 --> 20:57.924
Federal agents.
Everybody stay where
you are, please!

20:57.957 --> 20:58.991
Stay right
where you are!

20:59.025 --> 21:00.593
Hi. Hello. Excuse me.

21:00.627 --> 21:02.629
Hi. Camille Butler.

21:02.662 --> 21:05.031
VP of Communications.
Friends call me Cammy.

21:05.064 --> 21:08.034
Welcome. Welcome to
Dexmont Agricultural.

21:08.067 --> 21:10.437
From seed to success,
as we say.

21:10.470 --> 21:12.539
This feels like something
we can better handle

21:12.572 --> 21:14.707
if we head on in to my office.
Cammy,
we're from NCIS.

21:14.741 --> 21:16.042
We have reason to believe

21:16.075 --> 21:17.544
that you're harboring
a criminal here.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.546
Oh. On the record,
I can assure you

21:19.579 --> 21:22.349
we would never harbor a criminal
in this office.

21:22.382 --> 21:23.750
Off the record, is it...

21:23.783 --> 21:26.453
is it Karen in HR?

21:26.486 --> 21:27.153
Who's Karen?

21:27.186 --> 21:28.120
Someone who can't seem to keep

21:28.154 --> 21:29.822
her hands off
of other human's resources,

21:29.856 --> 21:31.023
if you know what I mean.

21:31.057 --> 21:32.058
It is not Karen.

21:32.091 --> 21:33.926
CAMILLE:
Not yet.

21:33.960 --> 21:34.961
SAM:
G...

21:36.363 --> 21:39.065
Is this 1745 West 10th Street?
Oh, no.

21:39.098 --> 21:41.033
It's 1845 West 10th.

21:41.067 --> 21:42.902
Well, this is embarrassing.

21:42.935 --> 21:45.738
Our mistake. I knew
as soon as we saw you,

21:45.772 --> 21:47.874
there's no way you would
tolerate criminal activity.

21:47.907 --> 21:49.542
Yeah, no, of course.
Of course I wouldn't.

21:49.576 --> 21:52.779
The only thing we harbor within
these walls is innovation.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.814
Keep an eye on Karen for us,
will you?

21:54.847 --> 21:56.549
You let us know
if she gets too handsy.

21:56.583 --> 21:58.351
Aye, aye, Captain.

21:58.385 --> 22:01.788
Kensi, you should have eyes
on Wallace any second.

22:01.821 --> 22:04.391
KENSI:
Got him.

22:04.424 --> 22:07.527
Wallace has no idea
how handsy it's about to get.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.495
(revs engine)

22:16.736 --> 22:19.739
Never thought
I'd see you again.

22:23.943 --> 22:28.581
Tell me about Operation Sunrise.

22:29.449 --> 22:31.384
You mean "Sunshine"?

22:31.418 --> 22:35.755
We were here to
secure certain assets

22:35.788 --> 22:38.391
acquired
during the war.

22:40.560 --> 22:42.529
"We"?

22:42.562 --> 22:45.131
You, me, Chegwidden,

22:45.164 --> 22:48.601
Bridges, Langston, and, uh,

22:48.635 --> 22:50.437
Owen Granger,

22:50.470 --> 22:54.974
who stayed on with us
after we pulled him out of Laos.

22:58.978 --> 23:00.780
I didn't work much
with the others.

23:00.813 --> 23:02.849
They considered me
an untested kid.

23:02.882 --> 23:07.153
But... you took me
under your wing.

23:09.188 --> 23:13.493
We were transporting
over $900,000 in gold

23:13.526 --> 23:15.728
when we got
shot down.

23:15.762 --> 23:18.565
I always wondered
what happened to that.

23:18.598 --> 23:20.500
My captors didn't find it,

23:20.533 --> 23:23.503
and there's no way you humped it
through the bush.

23:25.505 --> 23:28.608
I hid it until we could...

23:28.641 --> 23:30.577
get back for it.

23:31.678 --> 23:35.648
You came back for the gold
but not for me.

23:38.951 --> 23:40.587
(inhales deeply)

23:40.620 --> 23:42.922
By the time
we got back,

23:42.955 --> 23:44.657
the chopper
had been stripped,

23:44.691 --> 23:47.093
and all the bodies
were gone.

23:47.126 --> 23:49.596
You didn't think
to look for 'em?

23:50.730 --> 23:54.667
The jungle is like
a self-cleaning oven.

23:54.701 --> 23:55.702
You know that.

24:00.006 --> 24:01.674
You know,

24:01.708 --> 24:03.810
we collected that gold, in part,

24:03.843 --> 24:07.814
so we could pay ransom
for any captured operatives.

24:07.847 --> 24:10.683
I thought I'd be out
in a couple of days.

24:10.717 --> 24:13.152
But days turned into weeks,
into months,

24:13.185 --> 24:16.856
and nobody was paying
to get me out.

24:17.890 --> 24:21.961
If you really are Keane,

24:21.994 --> 24:25.965
nobody knew you were alive.

24:25.998 --> 24:29.936
And we were never there
officially.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.805
You still don't believe me.

24:33.773 --> 24:35.775
(sighs)

24:43.716 --> 24:46.185
These look real enough for you?

24:48.821 --> 24:50.823
(exhales)

24:53.192 --> 24:56.295
(scoffs) Looks like they're
using the same maid as Kensi's.

24:56.328 --> 24:59.766
Well, I'm gonna find and
expose the person behind this.

24:59.799 --> 25:01.834
Great. You focus on that,

25:01.868 --> 25:04.637
and I'll figure out who Wallace
is trying to sell this virus to.

25:04.671 --> 25:07.073
You do remember
you technically work for me.

25:07.106 --> 25:09.542
Because sometimes I feel like
you're the only one who does.

25:09.576 --> 25:10.476
What's going on with that?

25:10.509 --> 25:12.144
How come these guys keep
breaking their oath?

25:12.178 --> 25:14.847
You know the starting salary
of an LAPD officer?

25:14.881 --> 25:15.848
I do.

25:15.882 --> 25:17.584
It's Los Angeles.

25:17.617 --> 25:20.820
You try to buy a house,
put your kids through school,

25:20.853 --> 25:23.956
do right by your family
on that salary? Can't do it.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.759
I'm not saying
I agree with them. Screw them.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.160
We make choices.

25:28.194 --> 25:30.563
I'm just saying
I can see how easy it is

25:30.597 --> 25:32.064
to have your hand tipped.

25:32.098 --> 25:33.733
Well, how come
they never tipped your hand?

25:33.766 --> 25:34.767
(chuckles)

25:34.801 --> 25:36.903
I've given my life to this job.

25:36.936 --> 25:38.938
I'm five years away
from a pension that's going

25:38.971 --> 25:41.608
to two wives
that I lost to this job.

25:41.641 --> 25:43.810
I can't control everything,
Deeks.

25:43.843 --> 25:47.647
But my honor,
that's one thing I can control.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.849
I feel like
I should start a slow clap.

25:49.882 --> 25:52.118
(chuckles)
Okay.

25:52.151 --> 25:53.820
(car approaches)

25:53.853 --> 25:55.855
(tires squeal, car door opens)

25:55.888 --> 25:57.757
Kensi said Wallace
is five minutes out.

25:57.790 --> 26:00.126
So if he's coming here, he's
expecting to meet dirty cops.

26:00.159 --> 26:01.794
Well, that's exactly who
he'll meet with.

26:01.828 --> 26:02.829
Follow my lead.

26:02.862 --> 26:03.996
Oh, we're doing this?

26:04.030 --> 26:05.865
Oh, we're gonna do this.
Oh, wow.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.900
(footsteps approaching)

26:09.902 --> 26:11.203
(laughs)

26:11.237 --> 26:12.972
Look at your face!

26:13.005 --> 26:14.807
You look like you're
about to get arrested.

26:14.841 --> 26:16.075
Close the door.

26:16.108 --> 26:19.646
I swear, working with amateurs,
it's gonna bring down all of us.

26:19.679 --> 26:21.113
Do you have any idea
who you're talking to?

26:21.147 --> 26:23.315
Based on the lack of emotion
in the forehead,

26:23.349 --> 26:26.819
I'm saying a spokesperson
for Botox?
Who are you?

26:26.853 --> 26:28.721
You're not gonna see us again.
That's the way this works.

26:28.755 --> 26:31.891
Oh, great. So I'm shelling out
money to a bunch of mall cops.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.893
Oh, well, that is
an offensive stereotype.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.895
Besides, malls can be
very scary places.

26:35.928 --> 26:38.364
Have you been
to a Hot Topic lately?

26:38.397 --> 26:40.366
Some federal agents showed up
at my office.

26:40.399 --> 26:41.333
We are running out of time.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.402
So what I need from you
is to shut up

26:43.435 --> 26:46.005
and help me see this deal
through.
(whistles)
Ooh.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.407
I don't like the cut
of his jib.

26:48.440 --> 26:50.843
His jib is not cut well.
Okay, well,

26:50.877 --> 26:51.911
I don't make this exchange,

26:51.944 --> 26:55.147
and this jib isn't gonna be
cutting you a dime.

26:55.181 --> 26:56.849
Okay, relax, all right?

26:56.883 --> 26:58.184
You tell us where the exchange
is going down,

26:58.217 --> 26:59.719
and we'll tell you
how we're gonna get you there.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.088
(gunfire)

27:04.957 --> 27:06.358
DEEKS:
Son of a bitch!

27:06.392 --> 27:07.760
Three, two, one!

27:16.803 --> 27:18.070
(grunts)

27:22.341 --> 27:23.242
(grunts)

27:24.777 --> 27:26.645
(grunting)

27:32.351 --> 27:34.320
(gunfire in distance)

27:34.353 --> 27:36.355
Come on! Let's go! Let's go!

27:38.057 --> 27:39.325
(tires screech)

27:42.729 --> 27:43.696
(tires squeal)

27:43.730 --> 27:45.832
(engine revving)

27:45.865 --> 27:47.066
DEEKS: Guys, they're heading
your way now.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.438
(engine revving)

27:52.471 --> 27:56.275
This old song and dance.
He'll stop.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.077
Something tells me this
could seriously affect

27:58.110 --> 27:59.311
the whole aging thing.

28:14.393 --> 28:16.195
He should've stopped.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.239
I think your purpose is
to go down there and cuff him

28:27.273 --> 28:29.809
while I watch.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.228
Have a seat.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.331
All right.

28:52.364 --> 28:54.166
There's been
some confusion.

28:54.200 --> 28:57.036
Um, Simon is
the one you want.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.405
That guy is weird as hell,
and he's probably a sociopath.

28:59.438 --> 29:02.108
The only confusion here
is you thinking we're falling

29:02.141 --> 29:03.109
for any of this.

29:03.142 --> 29:04.276
How old are
you, Ryan?

29:04.310 --> 29:06.478
What? 39. Why does that matter?

29:06.512 --> 29:08.948
And how much would you say
you drink?

29:09.982 --> 29:12.118
Are you insane? Is he insane?

29:12.151 --> 29:13.920
What are you talking about?

29:13.953 --> 29:16.088
Facilitating the sale
of a biological weapon.

29:16.122 --> 29:17.423
You're looking at
life in prison.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.091
And life has gotten a lot longer
these days.

29:19.125 --> 29:21.861
Yeah, you could spend
at least 40 years behind bars.

29:21.894 --> 29:23.762
50 if he takes his vitamins.

29:25.164 --> 29:27.566
I didn't sell anything... yet.

29:27.599 --> 29:29.936
Then today's your lucky day.

29:29.969 --> 29:32.104
Intent to sell will get you
low-security by,

29:32.138 --> 29:34.140
uh, at least retirement.

29:34.173 --> 29:35.975
That is, if you tell us
who you're selling to.

29:37.343 --> 29:39.345
Stephen Lee.

29:40.379 --> 29:43.215
Oh. Stephen Lee.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.151
Of the Los Angeles Lees.

29:45.184 --> 29:47.019
That really narrows it down.

29:47.053 --> 29:49.421
Yeah, well,
I don't know much about him.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.223
He's just some sophomore
at Bunker Tech.

29:51.257 --> 29:52.291
Where'd you find him?

29:52.324 --> 29:55.327
You'd be amazed what you
can find on the Internet.

29:55.361 --> 29:57.496
So who does Stephen Lee
work for?

29:57.529 --> 30:01.000
You'll forgive me
if I didn't run his references.

30:01.033 --> 30:02.134
I'll forgive you
when you tell us where

30:02.168 --> 30:03.569
and when the drop is happening.

30:05.571 --> 30:07.874
Today. 4:00 p.m.

30:07.907 --> 30:09.976
Bunker Tech.
Outside Burton Hall.

30:17.149 --> 30:21.120
So, Beale confirmed that Stephen
Lee is a student at Bunker Tech.

30:21.153 --> 30:23.990
Yeah. He's a South Korean here
on a student visa.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.124
But he has been
receiving funds

30:25.157 --> 30:26.092
from a North Korean
bank account.

30:26.125 --> 30:28.594
Just to clarify,
that means that we almost had

30:28.627 --> 30:31.397
a crop-killing supervirus in the
hands of a maniacal dictator.

30:31.430 --> 30:33.866
Well, there's no way
we can arrest him

30:33.900 --> 30:35.634
unless we catch him
making the exchange.

30:35.667 --> 30:38.270
Then it looks like it's time
we get Wallace cleaned up.

30:38.304 --> 30:39.371
Let me talk
to him first.

30:39.405 --> 30:42.141
We need to find out who
he's paying off inside LAPD.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.542
We don't have time for that.

30:43.575 --> 30:45.311
We have an hour to set
this thing in motion.

30:45.344 --> 30:46.612
We could use
an extra hand.

30:46.645 --> 30:48.948
If you want to
help us, I promise

30:48.981 --> 30:50.382
you'll get all the time you
want with him afterwards.

30:50.416 --> 30:52.985
His name was
Lieutenant Roger Bates,

30:53.019 --> 30:56.155
and today was the longest day
of his life.

30:56.188 --> 30:57.890
Okay, Rickles.

31:03.462 --> 31:07.199
Yeah, the most fun
kids have these days

31:07.233 --> 31:09.201
is picking out their
Instagram filters.

31:09.235 --> 31:10.269
(chuckles)

31:10.302 --> 31:13.205
Yes, it is hard to rival
the unparalleled debauchery

31:13.239 --> 31:15.541
that were the hacky sack
tournaments in your day.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.376
I will have you know
that they called me

31:17.409 --> 31:20.346
Marty Marty the One Man Party
for a reason.

31:22.181 --> 31:24.383
That is one party
I am not sorry I missed.

31:27.286 --> 31:28.720
Wallace is almost on his mark.

31:28.754 --> 31:31.924
SAM (over comms):
Better hope he's more convincing
than he was earlier.

31:34.593 --> 31:36.362
Guy in a hat
approaching Wallace.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.164
Showtime.

31:41.100 --> 31:43.269
DEEKS (on radio):
He's getting lost in the crowd.

31:43.302 --> 31:44.937
G, you got eyes on Wallace?

31:47.206 --> 31:49.341
I got Lee,
but I can't see Wallace.

31:52.244 --> 31:54.180
Exchange has already been made.
I'm moving in.

31:56.148 --> 31:58.951
Federal agent.

31:58.985 --> 32:00.352
(grunts)

32:00.386 --> 32:02.421
(onlookers gasp)

32:04.156 --> 32:05.557
It's not Stephen Lee.

32:09.328 --> 32:11.030
Canister's gone.
Lee's not working alone.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.398
Where is it?

32:12.431 --> 32:14.600
I got a hundred bucks
to give it to a blonde.

32:14.633 --> 32:16.735
KENSI:
I got one coming down
the stairs; I got her.

32:16.768 --> 32:18.270
DEEKS:
I got the gaggle of blondes
to the left.

32:20.172 --> 32:21.974
Can I see this?
Sorry about that.

32:22.008 --> 32:23.442
No. You can-- okay.

32:23.475 --> 32:25.444
Hey.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.013
Get over here.

32:28.347 --> 32:30.716
Where is it?
I gave it to some guy.

32:30.749 --> 32:32.451
She handed it off.

32:34.386 --> 32:36.355
SAM (on radio):
I got Stephen Lee.

32:41.327 --> 32:42.594
(grunts)

32:54.406 --> 32:56.242
(laughing):
Come on.

32:56.275 --> 32:58.344
You didn't really think
it'd be that easy, did you?

33:02.648 --> 33:04.650
(indistinct radio chatter)

33:06.618 --> 33:10.556
There is a great bar
on top of that building.

33:10.589 --> 33:13.125
And I happen to know
that they serve whiskey.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.561
Oh, don't you think

33:15.594 --> 33:17.629
the Japanese would recommend
avoiding bullets, as well?

33:17.663 --> 33:20.532
We put ourselves
in danger every day.

33:20.566 --> 33:22.568
That's right. And we always
get ourselves out of it.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.438
Not always.

33:26.472 --> 33:28.540
(sighs)

33:28.574 --> 33:30.542
Look, I can't begin to know
what you're dealing with.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.544
I...

33:32.578 --> 33:34.480
I don't have
the same responsibilities.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.448
You got your own
responsibilities.

33:37.449 --> 33:39.718
I do.

33:39.751 --> 33:42.721
And as it turns out,
you are at the top.

33:44.790 --> 33:46.458
What are you talking about?

33:46.492 --> 33:48.527
You can't always make
the right decision.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.230
I mean, sometimes it's important
to make bad decisions as well.

33:51.263 --> 33:53.632
You may be adding
years to your life,

33:53.665 --> 33:55.701
but I think it
is my purpose

33:55.734 --> 33:58.070
to make sure that you also
add some living.

34:01.407 --> 34:03.509
Huh? Huh?

34:03.542 --> 34:06.178
(chuckles)
All right.

34:06.212 --> 34:08.314
We'll start cutting back
tomorrow, all right?

34:08.347 --> 34:09.681
Now you're
thinking clearly.

34:09.715 --> 34:11.083
Yeah.
Come on.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.584
Yeah.

34:15.521 --> 34:19.591
Yeah. Yeah, you're more
of a succulent, for sure.

34:19.625 --> 34:21.760
You're dry, beautiful,

34:21.793 --> 34:24.062
you don't need
a lot of attention.
(door opens)

34:25.797 --> 34:27.799
What's going on in here? Huh?

34:27.833 --> 34:29.701
Thank God. Tell me you have
a dose of the virus,

34:29.735 --> 34:31.670
'cause I'd love to self-destruct
right now.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.605
Look at you, making friends.

34:33.639 --> 34:35.707
So, Simon, you can
sleep well tonight,

34:35.741 --> 34:37.309
because we got 'em.

34:37.343 --> 34:39.645
Wh... Is-is the virus destroyed?

34:39.678 --> 34:42.648
It is on its way to the army
containment lab as we speak.

34:42.681 --> 34:43.649
It's in good hands.

34:43.682 --> 34:45.684
(exhales)

34:47.253 --> 34:50.622
You know, most people express
themselves with their words,

34:50.656 --> 34:53.425
and I show people who I am
through my research.

34:53.459 --> 34:55.661
And that's all I have.

34:55.694 --> 35:00.199
And this thing I created,
that's not who I am.

35:00.232 --> 35:01.733
Well, I spent less than
a day with you,

35:01.767 --> 35:03.702
and I have a pretty good idea
who you are,

35:03.735 --> 35:07.273
and I would say that people are
lucky to call you their friend.

35:08.307 --> 35:09.475
Okay?

35:09.508 --> 35:11.577
Really?
Yeah.

35:11.610 --> 35:12.744
All right, come on.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.346
You had a big day,
get out of here.

35:14.380 --> 35:15.647
Hmm?
Okay.

35:15.681 --> 35:16.915
Are you driving?
Yeah.

35:16.948 --> 35:19.185
Because you need to go slow.

35:19.218 --> 35:22.521
I have a very sensitive stomach.

35:22.554 --> 35:24.490
Non-stop commentary,
inappropriate touching.

35:24.523 --> 35:26.258
And the puns, oh, my goodness,

35:26.292 --> 35:27.359
so many puns.

35:27.393 --> 35:28.360
What's happening?

35:28.394 --> 35:30.496
What we talk about
when we talk about Deeks.

35:30.529 --> 35:32.731
So you both want to join
my book club?

35:32.764 --> 35:33.899
I'd rather get scurvy.

35:33.932 --> 35:35.267
Wow.
Wallace gave up

35:35.301 --> 35:36.635
his LAPD contact.

35:36.668 --> 35:38.604
A guy inside the
office of operations.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.306
I've had my eye
on that bastard.

35:40.339 --> 35:42.841
I just never could prove it
until now.

35:42.874 --> 35:44.710
A cop's not gonna rat out
another cop,

35:44.743 --> 35:46.312
so that's all the names
we're gonna get.

35:46.345 --> 35:49.315
I know, but at least
it's a start.

35:49.348 --> 35:51.817
I have a way
of making cops talk.

35:51.850 --> 35:54.720
If there's more corruption,
we'll find it.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.788
Uh, too many of
our men in blue,

35:56.822 --> 35:59.625
they've forgotten why
they wear that uniform.

35:59.658 --> 36:03.262
We could stand to bring one back
who knows exactly why he does.

36:04.263 --> 36:06.298
Oh. You mean, you mean me?

36:06.332 --> 36:08.500
To come back to the...
(inhales sharply)

36:08.534 --> 36:10.836
Yeah. I don't...
I don't know if that, uh...

36:10.869 --> 36:12.103
(chuckles)

36:12.137 --> 36:14.673
I mean, I kind of got the best
of both worlds right now, right?

36:14.706 --> 36:17.809
Representing LAPD's finest
and, with NCIS,

36:17.843 --> 36:19.711
working with a team that
I respect the hell out of,

36:19.745 --> 36:21.647
so as much as I
appreciate the offer,

36:21.680 --> 36:24.350
I got to pass, but thank you.

36:24.383 --> 36:27.553
Well, just remember that
for one fleeting moment

36:27.586 --> 36:29.288
I had something nice
to say about you.

36:29.321 --> 36:30.822
It's going straight
to the diary.

36:30.856 --> 36:32.258
I'm moved.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.892
All right, I got to get home.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.994
Wife number three's just begging
for a reason to leave me.

36:36.027 --> 36:37.496
I'll see you
at the office.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.697
I look forward to it.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.801
See ya.
I miss that mustache.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.270
I quit ya, Deeks.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.873
And then there were two.

36:47.906 --> 36:49.808
You did good work today.

36:49.841 --> 36:50.976
Sorry, what?

36:51.009 --> 36:52.611
Don't make me say it again.

36:52.644 --> 36:54.313
I just-- I couldn't hear it,
'cause you were mumbling.

36:54.346 --> 36:55.514
Just one more time.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.416
You did good work today.

36:57.449 --> 36:59.818
Ah, and there it is.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.820
So, does this mean we've even?

37:01.853 --> 37:03.489
I like you, Deeks.

37:03.522 --> 37:06.925
I know it doesn't seem like it,
but I do.

37:06.958 --> 37:10.262
And I wish I could say this is
the end of it, but I can't.

37:10.296 --> 37:12.764
'Cause the truth is,
is I just don't know.

37:14.300 --> 37:16.067
And I hope you
understand that.

37:19.938 --> 37:20.972
Night, Deeks.

37:21.006 --> 37:22.974
See ya around.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.882
(water dripping)

37:30.916 --> 37:34.019
HETTY:
How did you escape?

37:34.052 --> 37:36.455
I was saved by a cow.

37:36.488 --> 37:38.657
They were moving me

37:38.690 --> 37:42.294
and the two soldiers who
took me had been drinking.

37:42.328 --> 37:44.663
They were driving
like maniacs,

37:44.696 --> 37:46.332
we came around a corner

37:46.365 --> 37:49.401
(chuckling): and ran smack into
a big old heifer.

37:49.435 --> 37:51.437
(laughs)

37:51.470 --> 37:53.739
I was thrown from the vehicle.

37:53.772 --> 37:57.409
They-they weren't so lucky...
neither were the cows.

37:57.443 --> 38:00.779
Suddenly found
myself a free man

38:00.812 --> 38:03.649
with clothes, weapons,

38:03.682 --> 38:07.085
money, even some cigarettes.

38:07.118 --> 38:10.922
It was like Christmas.

38:10.956 --> 38:14.960
So why didn't you seek out
an embassy

38:14.993 --> 38:17.496
or someone who could help you?

38:17.529 --> 38:21.400
Because all I could think about
was getting revenge

38:21.433 --> 38:24.970
on the ones who did this to me.

38:25.003 --> 38:29.040
A-And I did...
a hundred times over.

38:29.074 --> 38:32.811
So you became...

38:32.844 --> 38:35.914
the two-sun.

38:35.947 --> 38:38.049
Between the
North Vietnamese

38:38.083 --> 38:40.686
and the wars with the
Khmer Rouge and the Chinese,

38:40.719 --> 38:43.088
there was always
someone worth killing.

38:44.155 --> 38:48.660
Then one day,
I just put my rifle down.

38:48.694 --> 38:51.730
Didn't want anymore of it.

38:51.763 --> 38:56.001
Walked into a nearby village
and never left.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.672
I even started
a family.

39:02.641 --> 39:05.043
Where are they now?

39:06.545 --> 39:10.382
G... Gone.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.786
God took them away
from me for...

39:14.820 --> 39:18.056
as punishment for all
the blood I shed.

39:22.628 --> 39:25.363
Why did they arrest you?

39:28.033 --> 39:30.802
I, uh, I wanted to leave.

39:30.836 --> 39:33.171
I wanted to start fresh
someplace new.

39:33.204 --> 39:35.807
I figured Thailand would be
a good place to go,

39:35.841 --> 39:37.809
but I don't have any papers.

39:37.843 --> 39:39.511
No ID.

39:39.545 --> 39:41.747
I'm a ghost.

39:41.780 --> 39:46.017
Dang is someone who...

39:46.051 --> 39:49.154
who could smuggle me
into the country.

39:49.187 --> 39:52.057
And what happened?

39:52.090 --> 39:55.393
I trusted him.

39:57.463 --> 40:01.066
Once he learned who I was, he
decided there was more money

40:01.099 --> 40:04.570
to be made holding me
for ransom.

40:05.571 --> 40:07.539
(door opens)

40:15.013 --> 40:18.917
Well, if it isn't my own
little Buddha.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.952
How much do you want?

40:20.986 --> 40:22.521
For him?

40:22.554 --> 40:24.523
Nothing.

40:24.556 --> 40:25.957
He's not worth anything

40:25.991 --> 40:27.726
to anyone.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.828
Besides,

40:29.861 --> 40:32.564
he already serve his purpose.

40:32.598 --> 40:35.501
You, on the other hand,

40:35.534 --> 40:38.704
you're gonna fetch
a pretty penny.
