- That was great, Devin.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.497
I'm good with that
take if you guys are?

01:38.599 --> 01:39.364
- I'm good.

01:39.467 --> 01:40.899
- Okay good, we gotta make this

01:41.001 --> 01:43.368
quick release before Christmas.

01:43.471 --> 01:44.670
- Cutting it close
this time huh?

01:44.772 --> 01:45.637
- Too close.

01:45.739 --> 01:46.405
- What can I say?

01:46.507 --> 01:48.307
Last minute inspiration.

01:48.409 --> 01:49.374
What'd you think, Harm?

01:49.477 --> 01:50.876
- Just one small thing.

01:50.978 --> 01:52.010
- Actually, you know what?

01:52.113 --> 01:53.579
You mind going and
getting me some tea?

01:53.681 --> 01:54.713
- Tyler can grab that for you.

01:54.815 --> 01:56.014
- No that's alright,
she doesn't mind.

01:56.117 --> 01:57.749
And she knows exactly
how I like it.

01:57.852 --> 01:59.318
Thank you babe!

01:59.420 --> 02:01.353
Look I'm gonna try that
bridge one more time.

02:02.223 --> 02:03.021
Wow.

02:05.993 --> 02:08.327
- They're doing another take,
said they'll open the door

02:08.429 --> 02:09.394
when it's clear.

02:09.497 --> 02:10.329
- Gotcha.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.533
- I think there's some
chairs in the back.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.834
- Thanks.

- Harmony!

03:37.918 --> 03:39.218
What are you doing?

03:39.320 --> 03:40.986
- I was just playing with
the lyrics a little bit.

03:41.088 --> 03:42.120
- We already laid
down the chorus,

03:42.223 --> 03:43.255
and I'm happy with
where it's at.

03:43.357 --> 03:45.257
When I ask for a tea
I expect to get it

03:45.359 --> 03:46.959
before the end of the session.

03:47.061 --> 03:48.193
- You were in the
middle of a take.

03:48.295 --> 03:49.261
- And it was terrible
because you were in here

03:49.363 --> 03:51.096
instead of getting
me the cup of tea.

03:54.068 --> 03:55.067
Thank you baby.

04:01.275 --> 04:03.041
- Did you write that?

04:03.143 --> 04:03.976
- What?

04:04.078 --> 04:06.645
Oh yeah, I did.

04:06.747 --> 04:11.016
- It's good, and you're quite
a beautiful performer too.

04:11.118 --> 04:13.185
- Trust me I'm not.

04:13.287 --> 04:16.988
That's all Devin, I just
occasionally write songs,

04:17.091 --> 04:18.457
and Devin makes 'em sound good.

04:18.559 --> 04:22.194
- Devin is Devin.

04:22.296 --> 04:25.897
But it doesn't seem like you
need him to make it sound good.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.133
I didn't realize that
we were recording a song

04:28.235 --> 04:30.035
that you wrote today.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.871
- Trust me Devin
is the star here.

04:32.973 --> 04:36.375
- One that didn't apparently
get there by himself.

04:38.245 --> 04:41.747
There's room for more
than one star in the sky.

04:41.849 --> 04:44.049
Look I like what I just heard.

04:45.152 --> 04:48.854
- You're very sweet, thank you.

04:48.956 --> 04:50.889
That means a lot
coming from you.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.059
Should we get back in there?

04:54.161 --> 04:55.360
- You do too much
for him you know?

04:55.462 --> 04:57.029
- I'm sorry?

04:57.131 --> 04:58.764
- Yeah, I thought that
even before I knew

04:58.866 --> 05:01.400
that you were the one
behind the music too.

05:01.502 --> 05:05.570
I see it all the time, these
guys taste a little bit

05:05.673 --> 05:09.174
of success, and completely
forget how they got there.

05:09.276 --> 05:11.076
- Devin's not like
that, don't worry.

05:12.212 --> 05:14.413
Truth is, he was
there for me at a time

05:14.515 --> 05:16.548
that I didn't have anyone else.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.950
So it's my turn to
be there for him.

05:19.053 --> 05:21.053
- There's a difference
between being there for

05:21.155 --> 05:23.255
someone and letting
someone use you.

05:24.191 --> 05:25.957
Be careful, okay?

05:26.060 --> 05:28.860
It seems like you're giving
more in this relationship

05:28.962 --> 05:29.961
than you're getting back.

05:46.313 --> 05:49.614
- Babe, earlier in the
studio when you went off

05:49.717 --> 05:52.284
and started playing your
own version of the song,

05:52.386 --> 05:54.219
you gotta run that
stuff by me first.

05:56.023 --> 05:57.589
- I'm sorry what?

05:57.691 --> 05:59.257
- You can't just go
off and play that stuff

05:59.360 --> 06:01.259
where everyone can here you.

06:01.362 --> 06:03.128
It's my song.

06:03.230 --> 06:05.097
Besides I thought I made it
very clear that if there was

06:05.199 --> 06:06.732
anything that you wanted
to change you would come

06:06.834 --> 06:07.999
and talk to me?

06:08.102 --> 06:10.001
- I tried to, you
wouldn't listen.

06:10.104 --> 06:10.902
- When?

06:11.004 --> 06:12.571
- Right before.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.072
- That's what I'm talking
about Harmony, you can't

06:14.174 --> 06:17.676
be interrupting me while I'm
in the middle of recording.

06:17.778 --> 06:18.944
- It's my song.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.078
- Really?

06:20.180 --> 06:22.013
Well then why am I
the one in the studio?

06:22.116 --> 06:25.617
Besides whatever you were
trying to play was totally off.

06:25.719 --> 06:26.685
- I thought it could be better.

06:26.787 --> 06:27.552
- It wasn't.

06:34.228 --> 06:35.227
Look,

06:36.196 --> 06:38.463
I appreciate you
trying to help, but.

06:38.565 --> 06:39.931
- But what?

06:40.033 --> 06:41.666
You don't want anyone to know
who's behind you're music?

06:41.769 --> 06:44.436
- You know you're not
listening right now Harmony.

06:44.538 --> 06:47.172
You wanna be on my team then
it's gotta be Devin first.

06:47.274 --> 06:48.407
You know this.

06:50.310 --> 06:52.611
I'm just trying to help you out.

06:52.713 --> 06:53.545
- Are you?

06:55.115 --> 06:57.015
Devin I don't know what
you're getting so upset about.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.185
It was half a song and no
one even heard it but you.

07:00.287 --> 07:02.821
I'm on your team 100%.

07:06.660 --> 07:07.359
- Thank you.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.800
Please don't put those
up babe, they ruin

07:14.902 --> 07:16.468
the whole aesthetic
of the place.

07:16.570 --> 07:17.235
- I like them!

07:17.337 --> 07:18.270
They're festive.

07:18.372 --> 07:19.438
- They're ugly!

07:23.677 --> 07:24.910
But you,

07:27.281 --> 07:30.115
you are beautiful.

07:32.686 --> 07:33.919
Come here.

07:40.427 --> 07:41.993
Sorry, just.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.328
Kevin!

07:43.430 --> 07:44.095
So sorry.

07:44.198 --> 07:45.263
Yeah I got a minute.

08:10.224 --> 08:12.424
- I'm telling you, Jules, he
was obsessing over nothing.

08:12.526 --> 08:15.060
I felt like a kid in
the principal's office.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.528
- You guys are probably
just distracted,

08:16.630 --> 08:19.564
because with the
holidays coming up and

08:19.666 --> 08:22.100
don't you leave for
the tour tomorrow too?

08:22.202 --> 08:25.237
- Yep, at 11:00 a.m.,
I'm packing right now.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.806
- I am so glad that I have
my Christmas decorating

08:27.908 --> 08:31.142
to do to keep me
distracted from packing.

08:31.245 --> 08:33.812
I can't believe that I
am gonna be freezing cold

08:33.914 --> 08:38.216
in Milwaukee with my crazy
sister and sugar-fueled nephews.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.253
While you are just living
it up in Los Angeles

08:41.355 --> 08:42.386
with VIP the treatment.

08:42.489 --> 08:43.788
- Living it up?

08:45.492 --> 08:48.660
- Oh my God, what if
he proposes to you

08:48.762 --> 08:50.562
while you're out there?

08:50.664 --> 08:52.063
- What?

08:52.165 --> 08:54.165
Where did you get that, I just
told you how off we've been.

08:54.268 --> 08:57.235
- Okay, maybe that's why
he's been so distracted

08:57.337 --> 09:01.106
because he's gonna surprise
you, oh for Christmas.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.675
Oh it is so romantic.

09:03.777 --> 09:06.778
My best friend engaged
to a superstar!

09:06.880 --> 09:09.281
I hope you know that I want
to be you when I grow up.

09:09.383 --> 09:12.350
- Jules you're ridiculous,
don't get ahead of yourself.

09:12.452 --> 09:15.820
- I'm just saying
that it's possible.

09:15.923 --> 09:16.755
- Sure.

09:17.925 --> 09:21.493
- Well that sounded
convincing, what's up?

09:21.595 --> 09:22.360
- Nothing.

09:23.530 --> 09:25.096
- Also convincing.

09:25.198 --> 09:29.968
- Seriously, I don't know
I just I feel like things

09:30.070 --> 09:32.971
were different between
Devin and I before.

09:33.073 --> 09:38.176
Like easier, closer.

09:38.278 --> 09:41.313
- Obviously, that
was a long time ago.

09:41.415 --> 09:42.948
He was just a broke kid,

09:43.050 --> 09:45.784
and you were the only one
supporting his dreams.

09:45.886 --> 09:49.354
You do know that you
practically made him right?

09:49.456 --> 09:53.558
- I just, miss the
old Devin sometimes.

09:53.660 --> 09:58.196
- Well the new Devin is
hot, and he is famous.

09:58.298 --> 10:01.232
And every girl would
do practically anything

10:01.335 --> 10:03.735
- Yeah I know, I'm very lucky.

10:07.808 --> 10:09.140
Hey Jules my dad is calling.

10:09.242 --> 10:10.875
Can I give you a call you back?

10:10.978 --> 10:14.245
- Wow, you're actually
gonna talk to him?

10:15.148 --> 10:16.881
Or are you just trying
to get rid of me?

10:16.984 --> 10:19.150
- I'll call you back,
Jules, start packing!

10:19.252 --> 10:20.819
- Yeah, yeah, later.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.322
You are coming with me tree.

10:25.692 --> 10:26.458
Oh.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.561
- Hiya dad.

10:29.663 --> 10:32.564
- Hey, you actually
answered your phone.

10:32.666 --> 10:35.033
- I know I'm sorry, I've
been meaning to call you back

10:35.135 --> 10:37.502
I've just been so busy.

10:38.438 --> 10:41.439
- It's alright, it's good
to hear your voice now.

10:42.509 --> 10:43.875
I'm just calling
to check and see

10:43.977 --> 10:45.677
if you got the flights we sent.

10:46.980 --> 10:50.415
I haven't, but I told
you, Devin and I leave

10:50.517 --> 10:53.418
for tour tomorrow, so I'm
not gonna be able to make it.

10:54.554 --> 10:58.890
- Oh I thought for Christmas
you'd get some time off?

10:58.992 --> 11:02.360
- Nope, Devin has a show
in LA on Christmas Eve.

11:04.464 --> 11:07.198
- And you have to be there?

11:07.300 --> 11:08.900
- Dad.

11:09.002 --> 11:13.271
- Okay, okay, we just
miss ya that's all.

11:14.508 --> 11:15.473
- We?

11:16.743 --> 11:18.410
- Debbie and I.

11:18.512 --> 11:20.211
- Dad, I don't even know Debbie.

11:23.316 --> 11:25.517
- Well maybe it'd
be nice if you did?

11:28.155 --> 11:30.388
- I have to go, I have a
lot to do before tomorrow.

11:31.425 --> 11:33.525
- Okay, okay, I won't
keep you any longer.

11:34.561 --> 11:35.660
I love you.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.730
- Love you too, talk soon, bye.

11:40.367 --> 11:41.032
- Bye bye.

12:21.908 --> 12:22.707
Here we go.

12:30.550 --> 12:32.117
Hey.

12:32.219 --> 12:33.618
- Hey.

12:33.720 --> 12:36.488
- They were out of sesame, so
I got you everything instead.

12:37.491 --> 12:38.556
What what's wrong?

12:41.328 --> 12:42.460
- We need to talk.

12:48.168 --> 12:49.200
- What a jerk.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.569
- How could he do this?

12:51.671 --> 12:53.104
I don't know what to do.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.407
- Did he give you any reason?

12:56.510 --> 12:59.077
- He said that with
everything going on

12:59.179 --> 13:02.480
that he doesn't have time
to commit to a relationship.

13:02.582 --> 13:05.116
And he doesn't want to
keep stringing me along.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.319
- Right.

13:08.421 --> 13:09.721
- I mean I know
things weren't perfect

13:09.823 --> 13:11.589
but I didn't expect this!

13:16.496 --> 13:20.532
- Well maybe this
is a good thing.

13:20.634 --> 13:23.434
I never really liked him anyway.

13:23.537 --> 13:24.969
- What are you talking about?

13:25.071 --> 13:27.005
You were the one who just
said how perfect he is!

13:27.107 --> 13:30.275
And how he was gonna
propose on Christmas!

13:30.377 --> 13:33.378
- Well that was yesterday,
and today, today

13:33.480 --> 13:35.680
you can do much, much better.

13:35.782 --> 13:38.883
- We've been planning this
holiday tour for months Jules.

13:38.985 --> 13:41.619
What am I supposed to do?

13:41.721 --> 13:44.923
- Well, I would invite you
to come to Milwaukee with me

13:45.025 --> 13:47.926
but I don't wanna
make you feel worse.

13:48.028 --> 13:51.262
- That's okay, I
appreciate the offer.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.466
- What if you went home?

13:55.569 --> 13:57.969
- No, I don't want
anything to do

13:58.071 --> 13:59.571
with that apartment anymore.

13:59.673 --> 14:03.308
- No, I mean home
home, to Miracle.

14:04.477 --> 14:09.480
- That's not home, that hasn't
been home since mom died.

14:09.583 --> 14:12.517
- Well, you're dad's still
there, and that house

14:12.619 --> 14:14.786
that looks so beautiful
at Christmas time.

14:17.858 --> 14:22.660
I mean it could be perfect
timing, you were just saying

14:22.762 --> 14:24.796
how much you missed your dad.

14:24.898 --> 14:29.033
- Yeah I do, but I don't
wanna go to Miracle.

14:29.903 --> 14:33.771
No one ever leaves or does
anything with their life.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.307
It's like the Twilight
Zone did an episode

14:36.409 --> 14:38.676
on a Kincaid painting.

14:38.778 --> 14:40.511
- Okay I love you
Harm, but you're being

14:40.614 --> 14:42.580
just a little dramatic.

14:42.682 --> 14:43.615
- It's true!

14:43.717 --> 14:45.483
- No it's not, you left.

14:45.585 --> 14:49.754
- I was lucky, the only
reason to visit before

14:49.856 --> 14:51.756
was because of family,
and now that my mom's gone

14:51.858 --> 14:56.861
I see no reason to subject
myself to that howdy doody.

14:57.130 --> 14:58.129
- What?

14:58.231 --> 15:01.099
I couldn't even,
what are you saying?

15:01.201 --> 15:04.135
Okay, I think that
you should just go.

15:04.237 --> 15:08.172
Because then you'll go and
you will feel so much better

15:08.275 --> 15:09.540
and you will just see
how far you've come,

15:09.643 --> 15:11.576
and you won't even
have to think about

15:11.678 --> 15:13.578
stupid what's his face.

15:19.886 --> 15:21.953
- I still have his stuff.

15:24.224 --> 15:26.791
- Consider it taken care of.

15:32.299 --> 15:33.865
Let's have some
more ice cream okay?

15:47.047 --> 15:48.246
- Great, okay.

15:59.993 --> 16:00.925
- Harmony?

16:08.168 --> 16:09.000
- Wonderful!

16:25.719 --> 16:28.953
I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.002
Ow!

16:44.104 --> 16:45.136
Ow.

16:46.573 --> 16:48.406
Nice one Harmony.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.707
Ow.

17:06.425 --> 17:07.825
No.

17:07.926 --> 17:08.693
No!

17:09.929 --> 17:11.162
No!

17:11.263 --> 17:12.262
No!

17:17.637 --> 17:18.469
- You don't need to shave.

17:18.570 --> 17:20.171
- Yes, I definitely do.

17:20.272 --> 17:21.539
Look there's hair right here.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.474
You're not looking.

17:24.577 --> 17:25.410
- Nothing to see.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.880
- Then you're just in
denial about my manhood.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.716
- Not at all.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.418
- Come on then look, you see it?

17:34.888 --> 17:35.820
- No.

17:35.922 --> 17:38.156
- It's right over
here, watch out!

17:49.402 --> 17:52.637

17:54.174 --> 17:57.375
- I'm really sorry about that,
seems like you were already

17:57.477 --> 17:58.443
having a bad day.

17:59.646 --> 18:00.611
- It's okay.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.214
I don't know what
I would've done

18:03.316 --> 18:04.215
if you hadn't come along.

18:04.317 --> 18:05.349
- Stayed dry.

18:05.452 --> 18:06.884
- Weston.

18:06.986 --> 18:09.654
- Maybe, but I
would've been stranded.

18:11.024 --> 18:13.224
Thank you for the ride.

18:13.326 --> 18:14.158
- His name's Luke.

18:15.662 --> 18:17.795
- Luke, nice to meet you.

18:18.698 --> 18:19.864
And you are Weston?

18:19.966 --> 18:21.065
- Correct.

18:21.167 --> 18:21.866
- Hi.

18:21.968 --> 18:22.967
I'm Harmony.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.001
- Nice to meet you.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.438
- So what brings
you into town Harmony?

18:27.540 --> 18:29.073
- Just visiting my dad.

18:30.210 --> 18:32.243
- What happened to your car?

18:32.345 --> 18:33.277
- I don't really know.

18:34.681 --> 18:37.348
- There's a gal, Becky back
in town, she'll be able

18:37.450 --> 18:39.050
to fix that for you.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.952
- Yeah she has a tow truck too.

18:41.054 --> 18:42.353
- Yes she does.

18:42.455 --> 18:43.287
- Thanks.

18:45.358 --> 18:48.259
- I don't think I've seen
you around here before.

18:48.361 --> 18:49.694
Is this your first time
in Miracle for Christmas?

18:49.796 --> 18:50.628
- No.

18:51.831 --> 18:56.567
But it's been awhile
since I've been back,

18:56.669 --> 18:57.802
and I'm not staying
for Christmas.

18:57.904 --> 18:58.669
- You're not?

19:00.140 --> 19:01.305
It's what like a week away?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.375
I figured that's why
you came here to visit.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.244
- Miracle's the best place
in the world for Christmas,

19:06.346 --> 19:07.745
everybody comes to town for it.

19:07.847 --> 19:10.948
- He's right, seems a waste
to visit so close to it

19:11.050 --> 19:12.383
and miss the main event.

19:13.353 --> 19:16.554
- We'll see, and at this
point I'm just wondering

19:16.656 --> 19:18.089
where the next
minute will take me.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.291
- That was Long

19:20.393 --> 19:23.728
Now here's the new release by
Devin Cruise, Christmas Wish.

19:23.830 --> 19:24.629
- So what's your dad's?

19:52.292 --> 19:53.391
I hate music.

19:54.460 --> 19:55.593
I hate music.

19:56.930 --> 19:57.962
- You hate music?

19:58.064 --> 19:59.330
- Yeah.

20:00.700 --> 20:01.832
- Is that like a?

20:01.935 --> 20:03.401
- Could we just not talk
about this right now?

20:05.939 --> 20:08.873
I'm sorry that was rude.

20:11.077 --> 20:13.844
It's just been a
really rough day.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.119
Thank you.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.825
I'm sorry about my
freakout, I'm a little

21:00.927 --> 21:03.427
out of my element today.

21:03.529 --> 21:05.029
But I really appreciate you

21:05.131 --> 21:06.497
going out of your
way to help me.

21:06.599 --> 21:07.431
- Oh you're very welcome.

21:07.533 --> 21:08.966
It wasn't out of my way at all.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.937
You need help with that?

21:13.039 --> 21:15.773
- I got it, thanks, it was
really nice to meet you Luke.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.042
- I'll send Becky
back for your car.

21:18.144 --> 21:19.277
- That's very nice of you.

21:19.379 --> 21:21.646
- It's no trouble at
all, I'm happy to help.

21:23.283 --> 21:24.015
- Okay!

21:26.552 --> 21:27.685
Thank you.

21:31.557 --> 21:33.758
- Let me know if you need
someone to show you around town.

21:35.395 --> 21:37.428
You grew up here, so
you don't need that.

21:38.464 --> 21:40.164
- I appreciate the offer though.

21:41.167 --> 21:42.466
Thank you again for the ride.

21:43.469 --> 21:44.535
I'll see you around.

21:44.637 --> 21:45.436
- You bet.

21:48.041 --> 21:48.873
I better go.

21:50.677 --> 21:51.842
Let me know if you need

21:53.413 --> 21:54.478
anything.

21:54.580 --> 21:55.613
- I will.

21:57.483 --> 21:58.482
Bye.

22:01.254 --> 22:02.420
- Bye.

22:16.436 --> 22:17.234
What?

22:19.672 --> 22:20.905
What is it?

22:21.007 --> 22:22.206
- Nothing.

22:31.551 --> 22:32.316
- Dad?

22:35.221 --> 22:36.420
Dad are you home?

22:39.225 --> 22:40.024
Guess not.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.108
- Welcome home.

26:27.820 --> 26:28.919
I love that sound.

26:31.791 --> 26:32.990
Haven't heard it since.

26:37.697 --> 26:39.730
- Stayed in tune.

26:40.766 --> 26:42.433
- I wouldn't know the
difference anyway.

26:45.338 --> 26:48.572
Well let's get you
something to eat.

26:50.176 --> 26:55.145
We got some catching up to do,
and maybe a little shopping.

26:57.216 --> 26:58.849
You could use a new wardrobe.

27:22.341 --> 27:23.540
- Harmony!

27:23.643 --> 27:25.376
- Pam, oh my gosh, hi.

27:27.813 --> 27:30.781
- I haven't seen you in forever.

27:30.883 --> 27:32.783
I haven't seen you
since your mom's.

27:35.554 --> 27:37.955
We were all really
worried about you after

27:38.057 --> 27:40.257
the service you
just disappeared.

27:40.359 --> 27:44.895
I tried calling but I figured
you had a lot going on.

27:44.997 --> 27:47.998
- Congratulations,
when are you expecting?

27:48.100 --> 27:52.136
- Thank you, February
9th, baby number two.

27:52.238 --> 27:54.071
- Wow, two babies.

27:54.940 --> 27:55.773
- I know.

27:55.875 --> 27:57.274
- Oh my gosh.

27:57.376 --> 27:58.075
- Yeah, you've missed a bit
while you've been out there

27:58.177 --> 28:00.010
conquering the world.

28:00.112 --> 28:01.979
How are things going with Devin?

28:02.081 --> 28:04.915
- They're good,
yeah, they're great.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.852
Listen I gotta run, but
it's great seeing you.

28:08.954 --> 28:11.288
- How long are you in town for?

28:11.390 --> 28:12.423
It would be great to get

28:12.525 --> 28:14.525
the girls together
for a little reunion.

28:14.627 --> 28:18.629
- I would love to, unfortunately
I'm leaving tomorrow.

28:18.731 --> 28:20.931
Or the next day, whenever
my car gets fixed.

28:22.635 --> 28:24.468
- Aren't you a tumbleweed?

28:24.570 --> 28:28.772
Okay, well, how about
you let me know next time

28:28.874 --> 28:31.341
you're planning on coming
back and I'll be sure

28:31.444 --> 28:33.210
to set something
up ahead of time.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.913
- For sure, yeah, it was
great seeing you Pam.

28:36.015 --> 28:36.780
- You too.

28:42.388 --> 28:43.587
Morning.

28:43.689 --> 28:45.589
- Good morning,
large coffee please.

28:47.493 --> 28:49.927
- Paint me green and
call me a pickle.

28:50.029 --> 28:51.528
Is that Harmony?

28:51.630 --> 28:52.596
- Shirley.

28:52.698 --> 28:55.132
- Girl you are all grown up!

28:56.202 --> 28:58.202
- It's good to see
you how have you been?

28:58.304 --> 29:00.871
- I was great until this
morning you remember Herman?

29:00.973 --> 29:02.372
Of course you remember
Herman, he and your mother

29:02.475 --> 29:04.074
always tickling those
ivories together.

29:04.176 --> 29:05.709
Man, I miss those gatherings.

29:05.811 --> 29:07.745
Well anyway, Herman decided
to inform me right in

29:07.847 --> 29:10.013
the middle of my scrambled
eggs and toast no less

29:10.116 --> 29:13.784
that he is moving to Bora
Bora in four days, four days!

29:13.886 --> 29:16.720
So he can no longer direct
the Christmas Music Festival,

29:16.822 --> 29:19.223
which is something he has
been doing for 17 years.

29:19.325 --> 29:21.191
- Bora Bora, wow.

29:21.293 --> 29:23.527
- Yeah supposedly it was
his wife Mary that talked

29:23.629 --> 29:24.728
him into it, isn't that

29:24.830 --> 29:26.697
the absolute worst
news you've ever heard?

29:26.799 --> 29:29.366
- Sure, yeah, I'm so
sorry to hear that.

29:29.468 --> 29:31.034
- Why he thinks he can
leave us high and dry

29:31.137 --> 29:32.236
on the single most important

29:32.338 --> 29:35.205
event of the year is
absolutely beyond me!

29:35.307 --> 29:37.274
- Miss, that'll be $2.

29:37.376 --> 29:38.542
- Oh, sorry.

29:41.413 --> 29:42.379
Thank you.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.480
- Have a great day.

29:43.582 --> 29:44.782
- Not likely with
this Herman business!

29:44.884 --> 29:47.217
So now I have to look for
a replacement for him.

29:47.319 --> 29:49.086
I don't know how I'm
supposed to pull this off.

29:49.188 --> 29:50.154
I'm mean I'm already busier

29:50.256 --> 29:52.156
than a one-legged
cat in a sandbox.

29:52.258 --> 29:54.091
But there's no one else
to do it except,

29:54.193 --> 29:57.427
so well, please give
your father a hug for me.

29:57.530 --> 29:58.962
And if you can if
you think of anybody

29:59.064 --> 30:00.230
to save our Christmas show.

30:03.536 --> 30:06.403
Harmony, Harmony's back in town.

30:17.983 --> 30:20.751
- And now it's
snowing, of course.

30:28.394 --> 30:29.359
I'm gonna get him back.

30:29.461 --> 30:30.494
- You wanna do what?

30:30.596 --> 30:32.329
- Yeah, no I think
it's gonna work Jules.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.631
I'm gonna show up in LA,
surprise him at his concert,

30:34.733 --> 30:37.334
and he's gonna realize this
was all just one big mistake.

30:37.436 --> 30:40.404
- I don't know if that's
the best idea, Harm.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.973
- I've been here less
than a day and I already

30:43.075 --> 30:44.274
feel like I need to leave.

30:44.376 --> 30:46.777
I don't fit in here.

30:46.879 --> 30:50.214
- While that totally is
fair, that doesn't mean

30:50.316 --> 30:53.183
that you need to go to Los
Angeles and try and win back

30:53.285 --> 30:55.953
the jerk who basically
called you excess baggage.

30:56.055 --> 30:57.354
- Maybe it does.

30:57.456 --> 30:58.522
- What about that
guy who gave you

30:58.624 --> 31:00.858
a ride the other day, Jake?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.326
- Oh Luke?

31:02.428 --> 31:04.127
- Yeah he sounded like a stud.

31:04.230 --> 31:06.363
- I'm not interested,
plus I'm pretty sure

31:06.465 --> 31:07.731
he's taken, he has a kid.

31:07.833 --> 31:09.299
- He does?

31:09.401 --> 31:10.834
You didn't say that before.

31:10.936 --> 31:13.003
- It's Miracle, Jules,
everybody has kids.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.571
They marry their high school
sweethearts and move into

31:14.673 --> 31:17.908
little blue cottages and
have white picket fences.

31:19.311 --> 31:21.979
- Thank goodness that you
escaped that nightmare huh?

31:22.081 --> 31:24.414
- Yeah thank goodness.

31:24.516 --> 31:27.251
- Listen, okay, I hear you
on the whole, not wanting

31:27.353 --> 31:30.254
to live in your hometown,
but that does not mean

31:30.356 --> 31:32.389
that you need to get Devin back.

31:32.491 --> 31:34.825
- He was my whole life,
you take him away,

31:34.927 --> 31:36.660
and there's nothing left.

31:36.762 --> 31:38.562
- Is that what you really want?

31:38.664 --> 31:41.865
- It's all I have, that's why
I am going to get him back

31:41.967 --> 31:43.867
on Christmas, I just
need my car to get fixed

31:43.969 --> 31:45.502
and then I'm out of here.

32:28.514 --> 32:31.381
- No that was perfect I
like that a lot better.

32:31.483 --> 32:32.649
- No, it was great before I.

32:32.751 --> 32:34.584
- I thought you hated music?

32:34.687 --> 32:37.821
- Yeah, that wasn't
entirely accurate.

32:37.923 --> 32:39.623
- Yeah, I figured as much.

32:40.426 --> 32:42.292
So what do you normally write?

32:42.394 --> 32:43.560
- Who said I write?

32:43.662 --> 32:45.529

32:54.373 --> 32:55.939
You nearly ran me over.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.007
- You were the one throwing

32:57.109 --> 32:58.642
a tantrum in the
middle of the road.

32:58.744 --> 32:59.509
- True.

33:01.246 --> 33:02.446
- So?

33:02.548 --> 33:03.547
- I really,

33:03.649 --> 33:04.748
I don't sing anymore.

33:06.218 --> 33:08.819
- Somehow I don't think that's
entirely accurate either.

and call me a sandwich.

34:55.994 --> 34:57.861
You two are a
blessing from above.

34:57.963 --> 35:00.564
The Christmas Music
Festival is saved!

35:00.666 --> 35:01.731
- What?

35:01.834 --> 35:04.601
- You two must music
direct the festival.

35:04.703 --> 35:06.636
- Shirley, I can't do that.

35:06.738 --> 35:08.872
- Well that's why
Harmony will help you.

35:08.974 --> 35:11.374
I can't believe I didn't
think of it before.

35:11.477 --> 35:14.277
Of course you would follow
in your mom's footsteps.

35:14.379 --> 35:16.313
I was coming here to beg Luke.

35:16.415 --> 35:18.415
Herman told me that you were
babysitting the shop today.

35:18.517 --> 35:22.285
But with the two of you
it would be perfect.

35:22.387 --> 35:25.422
- No, really Shirley, I'm not
gonna be here for Christmas.

35:25.524 --> 35:28.558
- Nonsense you have to stay,
Miracle is the best place

35:28.660 --> 35:29.426
in the world at Christmas.

35:29.528 --> 35:30.994
- No I have to go and.

35:31.096 --> 35:32.129
- And?

35:32.231 --> 35:34.331
- I have to be in LA
for Christmas eve.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.600
- LA?

35:36.702 --> 35:39.836
That's even worse than Herman
going off to Bora boring.

35:41.740 --> 35:42.806
- Everything okay?

35:44.443 --> 35:45.308
- I'm not sure.

35:48.614 --> 35:53.083
- My you're quite the popular
one, but it's fine I'll wait.

35:53.185 --> 35:56.620
- Sorry, let me just
figure out what's going on.

35:56.722 --> 35:59.589
- Harmony, you know that
the Christmas Festival

35:59.691 --> 36:00.924
is the most important part

36:01.026 --> 36:04.461
of our holiday tradition
in Miracle, and if you.

36:04.563 --> 36:05.695
- Shirley, I think
Harmony made it clear

36:05.797 --> 36:07.030
that she won't be here.

36:07.132 --> 36:07.831
- But.

36:07.933 --> 36:08.632
- No buts!

36:08.734 --> 36:09.666
- But.

36:09.768 --> 36:10.534
- I changed my mind.

36:11.570 --> 36:12.769
I think I'd like to stay.

36:14.873 --> 36:15.539
- Wonderful.

36:15.641 --> 36:16.973
- What?

36:17.075 --> 36:20.310
- Yeah, I think I'd like
to stay here for Christmas.

36:20.412 --> 36:24.281
- Oh that's perfect, oh I'll
be in touch with you later

36:24.383 --> 36:26.349
about all the details.

36:26.451 --> 36:28.652
Thank you for
saving the festival.

36:28.754 --> 36:31.955
And now I gotta get
busy planning Herman's

36:32.057 --> 36:33.790
If you knew what he put
me through, but I'm still

36:33.892 --> 36:36.960
giving him the best bon
voyage party that Miracle,

36:37.062 --> 36:41.198
no, ooh, the world
has ever seen!

36:47.940 --> 36:49.806
- What just happened?

36:51.510 --> 36:52.642
- I'm staying for Christmas

36:52.744 --> 36:56.713
and we're directing
the Christmas Festival.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.218
- Oh.

37:01.320 --> 37:02.385
Morning.

37:02.487 --> 37:03.720
- Well there you are.

37:05.724 --> 37:09.192
Sounds like an eventful
morning, from what I hear.

37:09.294 --> 37:10.627
Understand you're
gonna be directing

37:10.729 --> 37:13.930
the Miracle Christmas Festival.

37:14.032 --> 37:16.132
- How on earth
did you hear that?

37:16.235 --> 37:20.503
- Word travels fast in a small
town, made you an omelet.

37:20.606 --> 37:21.538
- Thank you.

37:21.640 --> 37:22.372
- Especially when you're talking

37:22.474 --> 37:23.473
about the Christmas Festival.

37:23.575 --> 37:28.445
- Mm mm mm, something
smells delicious.

37:28.547 --> 37:31.915
Harmony, it's so
good to see you.

37:32.784 --> 37:33.783
- You too Debbie.

37:35.220 --> 37:38.488
- Oh thank you darling, so
you're doing the festival?

37:38.590 --> 37:39.556
- With Luke.

37:39.658 --> 37:41.691
- Apparently so, you know him?

37:42.494 --> 37:45.495
- Yeah he's a bit of a town
star, if you know what I mean.

37:45.597 --> 37:49.165
- Please don't say that, I've
had my fill of stars lately.

37:49.268 --> 37:51.635
- Well not like that
honey, what Debbie means

37:51.737 --> 37:52.836
is he's respected.

37:52.938 --> 37:56.406
- A hero really, because
of Weston and all.

37:56.508 --> 37:59.309
- Having a kid makes
you a town hero?

37:59.411 --> 38:02.579
- Well in Luke's
case it kinda does.

38:02.681 --> 38:03.613
- A little bit.

38:09.454 --> 38:11.554
- Can we go ice skating
at the pond today?

38:12.524 --> 38:14.057
- I thought you
hated ice skating?

38:14.159 --> 38:15.492
- I kind of do.

38:15.594 --> 38:17.427
But I have to do an assignment
for Mrs. Brown's class.

38:17.529 --> 38:19.729
- Mrs. Brown told you you
need to go ice skating?

38:19.831 --> 38:22.499
- No, not really, but I
don't know what else to do.

38:22.601 --> 38:23.466
- Let me see that.

38:31.209 --> 38:33.943
Christmas is about more than
just time off from school

38:34.046 --> 38:37.614
and presents from Santa, but
what does it mean to you?

38:37.716 --> 38:39.449
Make your own version of
the 12 Days of Christmas

38:39.551 --> 38:41.618
with your own list of 12 things

38:41.720 --> 38:43.687
that matter most to
you this Christmas.

38:43.789 --> 38:44.954
Like ice skating?

38:47.225 --> 38:49.292
- I don't know, that's what
Kyle said he was doing,

38:49.394 --> 38:50.627
Sean too.

38:50.729 --> 38:52.796
- Listen if you want
to go ice skating

38:52.898 --> 38:54.230
we can we can go ice skating.

38:54.333 --> 38:58.635
But I think your teacher
wants you to pick something

38:58.737 --> 39:00.103
that's a little more meaningful.

39:00.205 --> 39:01.705
And unless you have
some secret life

39:01.807 --> 39:04.607
that I don't know about,
I'm sure we can find

39:04.710 --> 39:05.875
at least a dozens of things

39:05.977 --> 39:07.844
that would rate better
than that in your book.

39:08.914 --> 39:10.213
- Yeah this is why
I hate homework.

39:10.315 --> 39:11.448
- Yeah.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.051
We'll figure out something good.

39:20.025 --> 39:20.957
Hey you!

39:21.059 --> 39:21.758
- Hi.

39:21.860 --> 39:22.892
- Come on in.

39:24.563 --> 39:26.363
Let me get that for ya.

39:30.335 --> 39:31.735
- Thank you.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.503
- You're welcome, I see
Becky finished your car.

39:33.605 --> 39:35.605
- She did, and she was
every bit as brilliant

39:35.707 --> 39:36.639
as you said she'd be.

39:36.742 --> 39:38.208
- Yeah she something, after you.

39:39.711 --> 39:42.445
- Wow, you have
a beautiful home.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.948
- Thanks, and it's
a work in progress.

39:45.050 --> 39:45.949
- I don't know what
you're talking about,

39:46.051 --> 39:47.350
I think it's beautiful.

39:50.756 --> 39:51.688
- You remember Weston.

39:51.790 --> 39:52.922
- I do, hi Weston.

39:53.024 --> 39:53.690
- Hi.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.258
- Something wrong?

39:55.360 --> 39:57.293
- Oh he's just moody
over a school project

39:57.396 --> 39:58.128
that he has to do.

39:58.230 --> 40:00.196
- I see, what's the project?

40:03.535 --> 40:06.169
Wow, Mrs. Brown.

40:06.271 --> 40:08.805
Wait I remember this, I had to
do this when I was your age.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.507
I can't believe
she's still teaching.

40:10.609 --> 40:11.674
- Yeah she's ancient.

40:11.777 --> 40:13.643
- That's what I thought
at your age too.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.278
I can help you if you want?

40:15.380 --> 40:17.180
- Yeah, do you want
to give me yours?

40:17.282 --> 40:19.682
- I don't know about that,
but I'd be happy to help you

40:19.785 --> 40:20.817
make your own.

40:20.919 --> 40:21.885
- I guess that's fine.

40:21.987 --> 40:23.219
- Weston!

40:23.321 --> 40:24.020
- What?

40:24.122 --> 40:24.821
- Say thank you.

40:24.923 --> 40:25.688
- For what?

40:25.791 --> 40:27.223
We haven't done anything yet.

40:27.325 --> 40:28.391
- Kid's got a point.

40:28.493 --> 40:29.959
- I'm trying to set
a good example here.

40:30.061 --> 40:31.461
- You are.

40:31.563 --> 40:32.462
- Shall we get started?

40:32.564 --> 40:33.963
- Yes.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.833
Okay so Shirley assures me
that there are plenty of people

40:36.935 --> 40:39.702
excited to perform, so
that makes me feel better.

40:39.805 --> 40:41.204
- Yeah me too.

40:41.306 --> 40:42.639
- No, you should definitely
be up there with your guitar.

40:42.741 --> 40:45.141
- No, no, no, no, no,
I am happy to help out

40:45.243 --> 40:48.311
in any way that I can,
but I have no desire to be

40:48.413 --> 40:49.579
up on that stage.

40:49.681 --> 40:52.582
Music for me is more, personal.

40:52.684 --> 40:55.718
It's my therapy in a way,
and I don't feel right

40:55.821 --> 40:58.822
being in the spotlight,
does any of that make sense?

40:59.825 --> 41:02.258
- It makes all the
sense in the world.

41:04.996 --> 41:07.897
- It's Shirley,
sorry one second.

41:09.367 --> 41:10.133
Hello.

41:11.837 --> 41:12.902
Hey.

41:13.004 --> 41:15.705
- So, do you have any
ideas for the project?

41:15.807 --> 41:17.874
- Not really, I asked Luke
about going ice skating

41:17.976 --> 41:19.809
but he thinks we can do better.

41:20.846 --> 41:22.612
Why do we have homework
over Christmas break?

41:22.714 --> 41:24.113
It's entirely unfair.

41:24.216 --> 41:25.748
- Well I agree.

41:25.851 --> 41:28.117
But I bet we can figure
out something really good.

41:28.220 --> 41:30.620
- That's exactly what Luke said.

41:30.722 --> 41:34.591
- Alright, so, apparently
one of the pipes

41:34.693 --> 41:38.461
in Shirley's house broke
and everything is flooding.

41:38.563 --> 41:41.197
- Yikes, wait she
called you about that?

41:41.299 --> 41:42.465
- He's the guy everyone calls,

41:42.567 --> 41:44.734
he's basically
the town handyman.

41:44.836 --> 41:46.870
- I hate to do this
but can we reschedule?

41:46.972 --> 41:47.737
- Of course.

41:47.839 --> 41:49.138
- Thank you.

41:49.241 --> 41:50.306
Weston get your coat.

41:50.408 --> 41:51.541
- No, I don't wanna go.

41:51.643 --> 41:52.976
- Come on hurry up.

41:53.078 --> 41:54.611
- Why can't I just stay here.

41:54.713 --> 41:56.112
- You know I can't
leave you by yourself.

41:56.214 --> 41:57.747
- I'm not by myself.

41:57.849 --> 41:58.548
- Weston.

41:58.650 --> 41:59.816
- I can stay with him.

41:59.918 --> 42:01.217
- I can't ask you to do that.

42:01.319 --> 42:04.287
- You didn't I offered,
it's really not a problem,

42:04.389 --> 42:06.523
we can get a start on
Mrs. Brown's project.

42:07.893 --> 42:09.425
- Alright if you don't mind.

42:09.528 --> 42:10.927
- I really don't.

42:11.029 --> 42:11.861
- Thank you.

42:14.900 --> 42:17.934
There's lasagna and a
half a roast chicken here

42:18.036 --> 42:21.271
in the fridge, along with
there's plenty of roast veggies

42:21.373 --> 42:22.772
that you can just heat up.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.474
Mi casa es Su casa

42:24.576 --> 42:25.275
- Awesome.

42:25.377 --> 42:26.509
- Great.

42:26.611 --> 42:29.479
Oh first aid kit, right
here in the cabinet.

42:29.581 --> 42:31.681
Let me take it out, just
so you know where it is.

42:31.783 --> 42:33.750
- We're fine, go.

42:33.852 --> 42:34.918
Is he always like this?

42:35.020 --> 42:36.352
- Always.

42:36.454 --> 42:38.321
- Let me give you my phone
number just so you have it.

42:38.423 --> 42:40.290
- I have it, you gave me
your address remember?

42:40.392 --> 42:43.326
- Right, right, let
me give you the number

42:43.428 --> 42:44.794
to the town sheriff.

42:44.896 --> 42:46.829
- Seriously, go, help Shirley,

42:46.932 --> 42:48.298
her house is
flooding as we speak.

42:48.400 --> 42:49.532
- Good point.

42:54.439 --> 42:55.204
Okay.

42:56.241 --> 42:57.774
Okay, thank you.

43:01.913 --> 43:04.280
- Wow I cannot
believe that worked.

43:04.382 --> 43:05.748
- What do you mean?

43:05.850 --> 43:09.919
- Luke's uptight, he
doesn't really trust anyone.

43:10.021 --> 43:11.955
This means he trusts you.

43:15.093 --> 43:17.660
- Do you always call him Luke?

43:17.762 --> 43:19.062
- What else would I call him?

43:19.965 --> 43:20.897
- Dad?

43:20.999 --> 43:22.832
- Oh, Luke's not my dad.

43:22.934 --> 43:24.000
- He's not?

43:24.102 --> 43:26.469
- He's my uncle, my
dad died awhile ago.

43:27.439 --> 43:28.705
- I'm so sorry.

43:28.807 --> 43:30.740
- It's cool, he's a good
uncle, but he's definitely

43:30.842 --> 43:32.375
in denial about my manhood.

43:33.945 --> 43:35.211
- What?

43:35.313 --> 43:37.013
- You heard me, he thinks
of me as this little kid

43:37.115 --> 43:38.815
he has to take
care of constantly.

43:38.917 --> 43:40.917
You saw it just now, but
honestly, I'm the one

43:41.019 --> 43:41.951
taking care of him.

43:43.254 --> 43:44.988
True story.

43:45.090 --> 43:48.224
- I see, well he's
very lucky to have you.

43:49.194 --> 43:50.627
- We're lucky to
have each other.

43:51.963 --> 43:53.930
- Alright, what do you say we
start tackling this project?

43:54.032 --> 43:55.131
- Sure.

44:14.052 --> 44:15.051
- Hello?

44:18.123 --> 44:19.155
Weston!

44:21.926 --> 44:22.825
What's this?

44:22.927 --> 44:23.993
- What do you think?

44:24.095 --> 44:26.496
Just working on some
stuff for the project.

44:27.465 --> 44:28.798
- Where's Harmony?

44:28.900 --> 44:30.900
- She's here, she's getting
some construction paper.

44:31.002 --> 44:32.235
I told her where it was.

44:37.442 --> 44:38.207
- Aha!

44:40.979 --> 44:41.878
- What are you doing?

44:41.980 --> 44:43.112
- Oh hey you're back.

44:43.214 --> 44:44.213
- What are you doing with this?

44:44.315 --> 44:45.448
- Oh I was just trying
to get some paper.

44:45.550 --> 44:48.151
- Oh, yeah there's
no paper in here.

44:48.253 --> 44:50.353
- No I know it was underneath.

44:50.455 --> 44:52.789
- Listen thank you so
much for watching Weston

44:52.891 --> 44:54.957
but I got it from here,
I'll walk you out.

44:56.561 --> 44:57.360
- Okay.

45:01.900 --> 45:03.299
- Goodnight.

45:22.520 --> 45:24.520
- And that's when I told him
we had better do whatever

45:24.622 --> 45:26.923
it takes to find that
doll before Christmas.

45:29.928 --> 45:33.029
- That just made me very
afraid of when Emily

45:33.131 --> 45:35.098
starts asking for
specific dolls.

45:35.200 --> 45:36.265
- As you should be!

45:36.367 --> 45:38.334
Treasure these early
years while you can.

45:39.170 --> 45:41.037
- Are you bringing her to
Herman's big send-off on Friday?

45:41.139 --> 45:44.841
- Oh yes, We found
her the cutest

45:44.943 --> 45:46.342
Christmas sweater
and everything.

45:46.444 --> 45:48.678
- Leave it to Shirley to
make a Bora Bora sendoff

45:48.780 --> 45:50.680
party Christmas sweater themed.

45:52.183 --> 45:54.383
- I can't believe
Herman is leaving.

45:54.486 --> 45:56.085
I've missed so much.

45:56.187 --> 45:58.054
- Well you know, that's life.

45:58.156 --> 46:00.356
You had your own dreams,
but we are thrilled

46:00.458 --> 46:03.426
you're here now, we haven't
had a proper girls' night in

46:03.528 --> 46:04.927
I can't even tell you how long.

46:07.799 --> 46:09.132
- You know what though?

46:09.234 --> 46:12.535
I'm realizing, I don't think
that they were my dreams.

46:12.637 --> 46:17.473
I mean I gave so much of
myself to Devin, and for what?

46:17.575 --> 46:20.076
- Forget him, if he doesn't
know how special you are

46:20.178 --> 46:20.977
he doesn't deserve you.

46:21.079 --> 46:22.044
- Seriously.

46:22.147 --> 46:23.479
- And on that note,

46:25.083 --> 46:26.649
I hear you've been
spending a little time

46:26.751 --> 46:28.050
with the town stud.

46:28.153 --> 46:31.654
- Okay, I have heard
town star, town hero,

46:31.756 --> 46:33.489
and now the town stud?

46:33.591 --> 46:34.991
- Luke is all of those things.

46:35.093 --> 46:38.961
- Well great, I've upset the
town star, hero, stud then.

46:39.063 --> 46:40.263
- Upset him what?

46:40.365 --> 46:42.765
- Yeah I don't even
really know what happened?

46:42.867 --> 46:44.333
- Well?

46:44.435 --> 46:45.134
- Well what?

46:45.236 --> 46:47.003
- Well what did you do?

46:48.239 --> 46:50.072
- I was helping Weston
with a project while Luke

46:50.175 --> 46:52.108
was out I don't
know helping Shir.

46:52.210 --> 46:54.343
- What do you mean out?

46:54.445 --> 46:57.013
- He left you alone with Weston?

46:57.115 --> 46:58.981
- Yeah, is that a big deal?

46:59.083 --> 47:00.983
- Go on tell us the rest.

47:01.085 --> 47:01.918
- Okay.

47:03.321 --> 47:05.321
So I went upstairs to find
some paper and then Luke

47:05.423 --> 47:08.724
got home and saw me holding
this box by the hall closet

47:08.827 --> 47:12.862
and got all weird, and
he kinda kicked me out.

47:13.731 --> 47:15.198
- Wait that's it?

47:15.300 --> 47:17.834
He saw you holding
some box by the closet?

47:17.936 --> 47:18.701
- That's it.

47:20.438 --> 47:21.604
- Oh!

47:21.706 --> 47:25.074
Okay, I think I know
what's going on here.

47:26.144 --> 47:27.977
Get your coats let's go.

47:31.216 --> 47:32.148
- Harmony.

47:32.250 --> 47:32.949
- Hi.

47:33.051 --> 47:34.317
- Hey.

47:34.419 --> 47:35.251
- Shh.

47:39.424 --> 47:41.190
- What are you doing here?

47:41.292 --> 47:44.360
- I don't actually really know.

47:44.462 --> 47:46.229
- What is she doing?

47:46.331 --> 47:47.530
- Shh, shh.

47:47.632 --> 47:49.198
- I'm sorry about earlier.

47:49.300 --> 47:51.567
You didn't do anything
wrong, I just.

47:51.669 --> 47:53.135
- Ooh!

47:54.272 --> 47:56.372
- Oh, hey guys, how are you?

47:56.474 --> 47:58.007
- Hi!

47:58.109 --> 48:00.243
Hello it's so good to see you.

48:00.345 --> 48:02.144
Harmony, I didn't
know you'd be here.

48:02.247 --> 48:05.147
We were just out for a
little stroll in the area.

48:05.250 --> 48:08.184
All together, by the way,
really like what you've done

48:08.286 --> 48:09.752
with those hedges.

48:09.854 --> 48:10.887
- It's beautiful.

48:10.989 --> 48:12.655
- Oh look, here's
where I left my car.

48:12.757 --> 48:13.823
- Wait, guys.

48:14.659 --> 48:15.892
- Stay warm, bye bye.

48:18.196 --> 48:19.195
- Guys!

48:24.135 --> 48:25.401
- What was that about?

48:26.471 --> 48:28.504
- I think we all
just turned 13 again.

48:30.008 --> 48:33.242
Must be something in the air.

48:33.344 --> 48:34.744
- Yeah I don't follow.

48:36.014 --> 48:37.747
- It's a girl thing.

48:37.849 --> 48:39.982
I think I should get going too.

48:40.952 --> 48:42.518
- Didn't your ride
just leave you?

48:43.488 --> 48:45.087
- Yes, yes she did.

48:46.858 --> 48:48.090
- I can give you a ride.

48:48.192 --> 48:50.293
- No, no, you know what,
I think I'll just walk.

48:50.395 --> 48:52.228
It's nice out.

48:52.330 --> 48:53.095
- I'll walk you home then.

48:53.197 --> 48:55.031
- No, you have Weston, please.

48:55.133 --> 48:57.266
- What I can't walk a
beautiful woman home?

48:59.137 --> 49:01.704
- I didn't mean that.

49:01.806 --> 49:05.041
- Actually Weston is with
his friend Kyle tonight.

49:05.143 --> 49:06.008
Let me get my coat.

49:07.578 --> 49:08.244
- Okay.

49:18.189 --> 49:19.221
- After you.

49:24.862 --> 49:26.462
When did you move away?

49:27.999 --> 49:31.734
- Gosh, 10 years ago,
it's been awhile.

49:33.338 --> 49:37.406
I used to visit pretty often,
but then my mom passed away.

49:38.743 --> 49:41.210
It's just been kinda
hard to come back.

49:41.312 --> 49:44.880
It doesn't feel like
home without her.

49:46.451 --> 49:47.216
- I'm sorry.

49:49.087 --> 49:50.052
- You know I realized though,

49:50.154 --> 49:52.588
that it hasn't been
fair to my dad.

49:54.926 --> 49:56.492
I know I've neglected him.

49:57.795 --> 50:00.396
He started dating Debbie
and I couldn't handle it.

50:01.265 --> 50:02.498
Not that there's anything
wrong with Debbie,

50:02.600 --> 50:06.435
she's actually really
lovely I just, miss my mom.

50:11.542 --> 50:13.442
When did you move to Miracle?

50:13.544 --> 50:14.710
Tell me about you, yeah.

50:14.812 --> 50:17.513
- Me, God about
five years ago now.

50:18.750 --> 50:20.349
- That's right when
I stopped visiting.

50:20.451 --> 50:21.384
- Really?

50:21.486 --> 50:22.451
- Yeah.

50:22.553 --> 50:23.319
- Shame.

50:27.392 --> 50:28.457
- What brought you here?

50:30.428 --> 50:32.261
- Well I think you
already know part of this.

50:32.363 --> 50:35.898
And that is that
Weston isn't my son.

50:38.236 --> 50:42.872
I mean, he's legally mine,
but I'm not his real dad.

50:44.175 --> 50:46.375
- Yeah, Weston did mention that.

50:46.477 --> 50:50.212
- Yeah, yeah, he was
my brother's kid.

50:50.314 --> 50:53.382
And when he was born, his
mom, well she took off.

50:54.452 --> 50:58.220
Ad my brother when he passed,
I became his legal guardian,

50:59.490 --> 51:00.423
per David's wishes.

51:00.525 --> 51:01.991
And mine of course.

51:02.093 --> 51:04.560
And hopefully Weston's.

51:04.662 --> 51:08.497
- Weston told me that he
feels very lucky to have you.

51:08.599 --> 51:09.565
- No, I'm the lucky one.

51:11.169 --> 51:12.268
He's a good kid.

51:15.373 --> 51:18.074
And David, David
was a great dad.

51:18.176 --> 51:20.042
David was a great guy,

51:20.144 --> 51:24.547
and I know I fall
short of that everyday.

51:24.649 --> 51:27.783
- I can assure you
that is not true.

51:27.885 --> 51:29.852
I see what you do for
Weston and for this town

51:29.954 --> 51:34.957
and I can't even begin to
explain how in awe of you I am.

51:43.301 --> 51:45.034
- Hey where'd you go?

51:45.136 --> 51:46.268
Everything okay?

51:46.370 --> 51:47.536
- Yeah, yeah.

51:53.211 --> 51:58.214
So I've been so upset about
this guy that I knew was

52:03.321 --> 52:05.488
I guess I thought was the one.

52:06.557 --> 52:09.258
But I don't know, I
look at you and the way

52:09.360 --> 52:13.295
that you love Weston,
and my dad and Debbie.

52:13.397 --> 52:18.267
And the girls and
how happy they are.

52:18.369 --> 52:21.570
And I realize I never had that.

52:24.575 --> 52:28.944
I thought that I had to
get away from this town

52:29.046 --> 52:33.182
to be happy, and to
figure things out.

52:35.353 --> 52:37.419
And I've done neither
of those things

52:37.522 --> 52:39.255
by being away from Miracle.

52:40.725 --> 52:41.824
In fact all I've really done

52:41.926 --> 52:43.692
is neglect the
people that I love.

52:46.430 --> 52:48.197
Wow I'm sorry, that was a lot.

52:53.137 --> 52:56.372
- I know I don't know you
that well, but I'd say

52:56.474 --> 52:58.474
you've got the really
important parts,

52:58.576 --> 53:00.042
very much figured out.

53:02.280 --> 53:03.712
Weston doesn't just
take to anybody the way

53:03.814 --> 53:05.181
that he takes to you.

53:05.283 --> 53:07.349
And he's a very good
judge of character.

53:08.719 --> 53:11.387
- Weston seems like an
extraordinary young man.

53:11.489 --> 53:13.622
- You see it too don't you?

53:13.724 --> 53:15.191
- Yeah, who wouldn't?

53:16.427 --> 53:18.160
- My ex-fiance and I
were together for about

53:18.262 --> 53:21.397
six years before my
brother got sick.

53:21.499 --> 53:23.465
And in the being she was great.

53:23.568 --> 53:25.534
She was patient
and understanding.

53:25.636 --> 53:27.803
I mean I had uprooted
our lives to come here

53:27.905 --> 53:29.905
and take care of him
until he got better.

53:31.509 --> 53:32.474
And then he passed away.

53:34.545 --> 53:35.644
And she changed.

53:37.248 --> 53:42.251
I mean she couldn't understand
why I would wanna be

53:43.688 --> 53:48.023
Weston's guardian, she
just saw him as this kid

53:48.125 --> 53:50.593
that was getting in the
way of her life plans.

53:51.963 --> 53:55.831
And ultimately she gave me a
choice, and I chose Weston.

53:57.868 --> 54:00.502
And she chose this prat banker.

54:00.605 --> 54:03.572
And fell in love with
his jet, or at least

54:04.375 --> 54:07.943
I tell myself she fell
in love with his jet.

54:08.045 --> 54:09.812
- Luke I am so sorry.

54:11.983 --> 54:15.918
- It's okay, we wanted two
different things in life.

54:16.020 --> 54:18.554
And we would have
never discovered that

54:18.656 --> 54:20.789
if none of this happened.

54:22.126 --> 54:23.592
It doesn't mean I
wasn't very much

54:23.694 --> 54:25.494
in love with her at one time.

54:26.964 --> 54:29.965
- Well that whole
town hero thing

54:30.067 --> 54:31.700
makes a lot more sense now.

54:32.637 --> 54:33.535
- Town hero?

54:35.039 --> 54:36.672
- Yeah it's just
something I heard.

54:39.477 --> 54:41.610
You're a good man, Luke.

54:42.546 --> 54:43.912
And everyone can see it.

54:47.818 --> 54:49.685
Is this where we're
gonna be tomorrow?

54:49.787 --> 54:55.691
- I believe so.

55:01.932 --> 55:04.900
- Wow, quite the setup.

55:05.870 --> 55:07.936
Are you ready for
this adventure, Luke?

55:08.039 --> 55:08.937
- Not in the slightest.

55:11.275 --> 55:13.309
- Well then should
we try a test run

55:13.411 --> 55:14.810
before we have to teach
everyone tomorrow?

55:14.912 --> 55:15.744
- Sure.

55:18.482 --> 55:22.851
- Actually this is something
that I was writing earlier,

55:22.953 --> 55:25.120
when I was thinking, you'll see.

55:26.057 --> 55:29.558
Let's see if we can
do anything with them.

55:32.963 --> 55:34.129
- These are beautiful.

55:34.231 --> 55:36.265
- They're a work
in progress, but.

55:37.902 --> 55:38.634
- Let's try it.

55:39.503 --> 55:40.269
- Okay.

- Henry!

58:18.062 --> 58:19.394
- Hey Herman.

58:21.232 --> 58:21.997
- Debbie.

58:22.099 --> 58:23.165
- How ya doing big guy?

58:23.267 --> 58:24.833
- Oh wonderful now.

58:24.935 --> 58:26.368
Thank you guys for coming out.

58:26.470 --> 58:28.971
- We wouldn't of missed
it for the world.

58:29.073 --> 58:30.305
- And Harmony!

58:34.178 --> 58:36.578
You may look like the spitting
image of your mother now

58:36.680 --> 58:40.015
but I'll never forget that
sweet little girl with pigtails

58:40.117 --> 58:42.317
who always made
our music better.

58:42.419 --> 58:44.086
- Thanks Uncle Herman.

58:44.188 --> 58:46.321
- This place looks spectacular.

58:46.423 --> 58:47.422
- It's all Shirley.

58:47.525 --> 58:49.358
- Has she forgiven
you yet for leaving?

58:49.460 --> 58:50.926
- Not in the slightest.

58:53.097 --> 58:55.030
- You gonna be performing
for us tonight Herman?

58:55.132 --> 58:59.034
- No, not tonight Henry,
I am relaxing tonight.

58:59.136 --> 59:00.335
You guys grab some drink,

59:00.437 --> 59:02.971
grab some good, and
enjoy yourselves.

59:03.073 --> 59:04.640
I'm gonna go do the rounds.

59:09.513 --> 59:12.848
- Bora Bora, but he's
a Miracle institution.

59:12.950 --> 59:14.516
- People do crazy
things for love.

59:16.353 --> 59:17.352
- Ah,

59:17.454 --> 59:18.320
I'll be right back.

59:21.292 --> 59:23.959
- Crazy things indeed.

59:26.297 --> 59:26.962
- Hey.

59:27.064 --> 59:28.030
- Hey guys.

59:28.132 --> 59:29.298
- Looking good.

59:29.400 --> 59:30.899
- Thank you very much,
how's the project coming?

59:31.001 --> 59:31.867
- Almost finished.

59:31.969 --> 59:33.035
- Excellent.

59:33.137 --> 59:35.103
- Oh there's Kyle,
I'm gonna go say hi.

59:37.474 --> 59:38.307
- Go ahead.

59:40.077 --> 59:42.978
- You're sweater is
quite lovely as well,

59:43.080 --> 59:44.780
are those sideways
Christmas trees?

59:46.350 --> 59:47.416
It's great.

59:47.518 --> 59:48.383
- Luke, Harmony, I am
so glad I found you.

59:48.485 --> 59:50.152
We have a catastrophic
situation.

59:50.254 --> 59:51.053
- What's wrong?

59:51.155 --> 59:52.387
- Herman's band hasn't shown up.

59:52.489 --> 59:53.488
I've called but there's
no answer, and they were

59:53.591 --> 59:54.790
supposed to be here
over an hour ago.

59:54.892 --> 59:55.791
- I'm sure they'll turn up.

59:55.893 --> 59:57.159
- Oh, I'm not so sure.

59:57.261 --> 59:58.427
- Everyone's having
a great time.

59:58.529 --> 59:59.895
- Yeah I wouldn't
worry about it.

59:59.997 --> 01:00:01.997
- You kids are gonna
have to replace them.

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:03.498
- I'm sorry, what?

01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:05.100
- We cannot have a proper
going away party with no music.

01:00:05.202 --> 01:00:06.335
We're all set up for it.

01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:09.171
I know you guys can do
it, so if Herman's band

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:10.505
doesn't get here in
the next 30 minutes,

01:00:10.608 --> 01:00:11.974
I am gonna introduce you.

01:00:12.076 --> 01:00:14.843
So why don't you go tune up
or whatever it is you do.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:17.079
- No, Shirley we can't do that.

01:00:17.181 --> 01:00:18.747
I can play for the festival
singers if you want?

01:00:18.849 --> 01:00:20.082
I just saw Kristen.

01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:23.118
- Nonsense, I hear you
two rehearsing every day,

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.519
and we have to save the festival

01:00:24.622 --> 01:00:26.121
performance for the festival.

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:28.624
Oh no could you hold on a
minute, I see a wayward elf

01:00:28.726 --> 01:00:30.659
about to serve the
cheese quiche to Daniel,

01:00:30.761 --> 01:00:32.427
and we all know he's
lactose intolerant.

01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:34.529
Daniel put down the quiche.

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:38.033
- How does this keep happening?

01:00:38.135 --> 01:00:39.034
- It'll be fine.

01:00:39.136 --> 01:00:41.169
I'm sure the band will show up.

01:00:41.271 --> 01:00:43.038
I can't believe the
band didn't show up.

01:00:43.140 --> 01:00:45.273
- Are we really
about to do this?

01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:50.145
- Friends, please welcome to
the stage Harmony and Luke!

01:00:56.286 --> 01:00:57.886
- Thank you, Shirley.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:01.189
And thank you everyone for
being here to celebrate

01:01:01.291 --> 01:01:03.659
an incredible man
and woman who have

01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:05.394
done so much for this town.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:14.302
This is a little song that
we wrote about the chaos

01:01:14.405 --> 01:01:17.072
of getting ready
for the holidays.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:19.007

you to help us out.

- Okay that was kinda fun.

01:02:53.370 --> 01:02:54.269
- Yeah it was.

01:02:54.371 --> 01:02:55.370
- Look up.

01:02:58.008 --> 01:03:00.909
- Everything's missing
but the mistletoe, ha ha.

01:03:03.847 --> 01:03:05.347
- Not everything.

01:03:21.131 --> 01:03:22.130
- Good morning.

01:03:22.232 --> 01:03:23.532
- Good morning,
did you sleep well?

01:03:23.634 --> 01:03:25.033
- Very.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:28.270
- Excellent, that was quite
a show you put on last night.

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:29.771
- It was fun.

01:03:29.873 --> 01:03:33.408
- And if I'm not mistaken I
think maybe you're just a little

01:03:34.711 --> 01:03:36.244
- A little what?

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:37.145
- Smitten.

01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:42.851
- Maybe I am, he's a
really good guy isn't he?

01:03:42.953 --> 01:03:43.718
- Very.

01:03:45.689 --> 01:03:46.421
- Good morning.

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:48.223
- Morning.

01:03:48.325 --> 01:03:51.193
- So I heard something really
interesting this morning.

01:03:51.295 --> 01:03:52.060
- Yeah?

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:53.461
- Yeah.

01:03:53.564 --> 01:03:56.631
I heard that apparently some
kid called Herman's band

01:03:56.733 --> 01:03:59.467
last night to tell them
that the party was canceled.

01:04:00.671 --> 01:04:03.171
- You wouldn't happen to
know anything about that,

01:04:06.276 --> 01:04:07.042
would you?

01:04:09.313 --> 01:04:11.713
- I don't know that
anything can happen.

01:04:11.815 --> 01:04:13.748
I don't live here for one.

01:04:13.851 --> 01:04:16.818
- Ooh smitten indeed.

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:18.453
I don't think you have to worry
about that part right now,

01:04:18.555 --> 01:04:20.755
just enjoy it.

01:04:20.858 --> 01:04:21.823
- Yeah.

01:04:21.925 --> 01:04:23.391
- And If last night
was any preview

01:04:23.493 --> 01:04:26.394
for the Christmas Festival,
huh, I can't wait!

01:04:26.496 --> 01:04:29.397
- No, no, we're not
going to perform.

01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:31.466
But we are going to
accompany over a dozen

01:04:31.568 --> 01:04:33.335
of Miracle's finest talents.

01:04:33.437 --> 01:04:37.105
- Well maybe you could
make a small appearance.

01:04:37.207 --> 01:04:39.140
I don't think I've ever
seen your dad as happy

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:41.910
as he was last night
watching you sing.

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:44.112
You know he keeps that
piano over there tuned up

01:04:44.214 --> 01:04:47.415
regularly for you, just in case.

01:04:48.619 --> 01:04:49.484
- He does?

01:04:49.586 --> 01:04:50.418
- Mm hmm.

01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:54.890
- I'll get it.

01:05:06.737 --> 01:05:07.502
Devin, what are you doing here?

01:05:07.604 --> 01:05:08.503
- I messed up Harmony.

01:05:08.605 --> 01:05:10.171
Look I never should
have left you.

01:05:10.274 --> 01:05:11.673
- You can't just show up.

01:05:11.775 --> 01:05:13.942
- I just need five minutes,
look I got you some flowers.

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:15.577
So this is where
you grew up huh?

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:18.880
It's rustic.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:21.816
Awe.

01:05:21.919 --> 01:05:23.051
I missed you Harmony.

01:05:25.322 --> 01:05:26.688
I need you.

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:29.124
I was just so stressed about
the record, and the label,

01:05:29.226 --> 01:05:32.294
and everything getting
so crazy I didn't realize

01:05:32.396 --> 01:05:33.995
how much I needed you.

01:05:34.097 --> 01:05:36.298
But I've been thinking a lot
about us and there's something

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.600
that I should've
done a long time ago.

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.073
So, what do ya say?

01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:47.409
Marry me.

01:05:49.813 --> 01:05:52.514
- Well the first batch
seems perfect if you want.

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.649
- Somebody say
cookies are ready?

01:05:54.751 --> 01:05:57.619
- Mr. Collins so good to
finally meet you, I'm Devin.

01:06:04.761 --> 01:06:05.760
Luke.
- Harmony.

01:06:08.031 --> 01:06:08.763
- This a bad time?

01:06:08.865 --> 01:06:11.666
- Hey, I'm Harmony's fiance.

01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:12.534
- Fiance?

01:06:12.636 --> 01:06:13.401
- Yeah.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:15.236
- Right.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:17.639
I'm gonna go.

01:06:18.976 --> 01:06:20.642
- Luke, Luke, wait Luke.

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:23.011
- What?

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:24.212
- Just give me a minute.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:25.046
- You're engaged?

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:26.348
- No, I don't know.

01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:27.449
- You don't know?

01:06:27.551 --> 01:06:28.616
- He just showed up
and surprised me,

01:06:28.719 --> 01:06:30.085
I'm still trying to
process everything.

01:06:30.187 --> 01:06:32.387
- Well by all means don't let
me interrupt your process.

01:06:32.489 --> 01:06:33.555
- Luke!

01:06:45.869 --> 01:06:47.135
- You have any allergies?

01:06:48.005 --> 01:06:48.703
- Devin!

01:06:48.805 --> 01:06:49.604
- Who was that guy?

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:52.107
- Harmony are you alright?

01:06:53.643 --> 01:06:54.576
- I'm gonna make some tea.

01:06:54.678 --> 01:06:56.044
- Tea, that would
be a great idea.

01:06:56.146 --> 01:06:58.279
- Harmony, what's going on?

01:06:58.382 --> 01:07:00.815
- Honey why don't you follow me?

01:07:00.917 --> 01:07:03.051
- But I wanna know
what's going on.

01:07:05.022 --> 01:07:08.823
- Devin, you and me, we're
gonna have a talk, right now.

01:07:10.994 --> 01:07:14.629
- Okay, this way?

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.707
- Why did you think it
was okay to come here?

01:07:26.576 --> 01:07:30.412
- Because I wanted to
surprise you, and I wanted

01:07:30.514 --> 01:07:32.680
to tell you that
I made a mistake.

01:07:32.783 --> 01:07:36.518
Look Harm, we both
know that you can be

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:40.588
a little bit stubborn but,
I'm willing to look past that.

01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:45.693
Now you and me, we make
sense, this not so much.

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:50.265
But we look good together,
we've got history.

01:07:50.367 --> 01:07:52.534
Now I know I wasn't at
my best, I admit that,

01:07:52.636 --> 01:07:54.969
but what I realized
was, I was about to make

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:58.173
the biggest mistake of my
entire life by leaving you.

01:08:01.478 --> 01:08:02.777
I need you Harm.

01:08:03.980 --> 01:08:06.281
- Devin you can't just
say things like that.

01:08:06.383 --> 01:08:08.216
- Well why not?

01:08:08.318 --> 01:08:10.852
I still know that we are
meant to be together.

01:08:10.954 --> 01:08:12.887
Don't throw away
all of these years.

01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:18.725
Harmony I need you on my team.

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:20.194
You're my number one girl.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.633
- Oh my God!

01:08:28.939 --> 01:08:30.004
Harmony are you going to
introduce us to the reason

01:08:30.107 --> 01:08:32.307
why you haven't had
time for any of us?

01:08:32.408 --> 01:08:33.675
- Hi I'm Pamela.

01:08:33.777 --> 01:08:35.009
- Hi.

01:08:35.112 --> 01:08:37.011
- And my daughter Kayla
she's your biggest fan,

01:08:37.113 --> 01:08:38.479
- We all are.

01:08:40.350 --> 01:08:41.149
- Do you mind?

01:08:41.251 --> 01:08:42.750
- Not at all, do you have a pen?

01:08:42.853 --> 01:08:44.586
- Pen, pen, pen.

01:08:44.688 --> 01:08:45.720
- I'll be right back.

01:08:45.822 --> 01:08:47.221
- Oh I just loved
your last music video.

01:08:47.323 --> 01:08:48.156
- Oh thank you.

01:08:48.258 --> 01:08:49.657
- It was really, really good.

01:08:49.759 --> 01:08:50.725
- Now who do you won't
me to make this out for?

01:08:50.827 --> 01:08:53.495
- April, Emily, Pamela, Trisha.

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:55.763
- Weston wait up, hold on.

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.032
- So it's true.

01:08:58.135 --> 01:08:59.533
Luke told me but I
didn't believe him,

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:01.536
but I guess it's true.

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:02.403
- What's true?

01:09:02.506 --> 01:09:03.671
- That you're marrying that guy.

01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:05.773
- No, I don't know, I'm
trying to figure it.

01:09:05.876 --> 01:09:07.408
- Don't do it.

01:09:07.511 --> 01:09:08.376
- What?

01:09:08.478 --> 01:09:09.911
- Don't.

01:09:24.728 --> 01:09:26.294
- I was hoping
I'd find you here.

01:09:28.331 --> 01:09:29.096
- Here I am.

01:09:31.134 --> 01:09:31.866
- Can we talk?

01:09:32.801 --> 01:09:33.835
- You marrying Devin?

01:09:36.139 --> 01:09:36.871
- I don't know.

01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.506
- What does that even mean?

01:09:40.410 --> 01:09:42.277
- Look this isn't
easy for me, okay?

01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:44.312
This isn't what I
wanted to happen.

01:09:44.413 --> 01:09:46.747
- Really, from the
looks of it I'd say

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:49.651
it's exactly what
you wanted to happen.

01:09:50.687 --> 01:09:52.720
Why are you even here?

01:09:52.822 --> 01:09:54.722
Shouldn't you be
with your fiance.

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:57.725
- No I wanted to talk to
you, I thought that maybe.

01:09:57.827 --> 01:10:01.062
- That maybe I would
what give you permission?

01:10:01.164 --> 01:10:01.829
- No!

01:10:01.932 --> 01:10:02.964
- Then what?

01:10:04.601 --> 01:10:05.934
- I don't know.

01:10:06.036 --> 01:10:09.771
- Yeah you do, but I'm
not gonna decide your life

01:10:09.873 --> 01:10:10.872
the way he did.

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:14.676
- Tell me there's
nothing between us,

01:10:14.778 --> 01:10:17.111
tell me that I am the
only one who can't stop

01:10:17.214 --> 01:10:18.513
thinking about that kiss.

01:10:19.883 --> 01:10:20.882
- What kiss?

01:10:22.219 --> 01:10:24.152

we can hear you now.

01:13:11.087 --> 01:13:11.819
What's up?

01:13:11.921 --> 01:13:13.287
- I wanna do that part again.

01:13:13.390 --> 01:13:15.356
- Of course we're gonna just
finish this listen through

01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:17.725
and then we'll get set up
for another take, cool.

01:13:17.827 --> 01:13:18.860
- Yeah it's cool.

01:13:23.233 --> 01:13:26.367
- You're sounding great,
looking great too.

01:13:26.469 --> 01:13:28.369
- What are you doing,
stop, Harmony can see you.

01:13:28.471 --> 01:13:29.637
- So what?

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:32.373
- So we're engaged now,
we talked about this.

01:13:33.243 --> 01:13:35.209
- Does that mean that
we're not on for tonight?

01:13:35.311 --> 01:13:37.879
- Yes, we are still
on for tonight.

01:13:37.981 --> 01:13:39.647
You're my number one
girl, but you can't pull

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:41.416
this stuff while
she's around okay?

01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:44.952
- What do you see
in her anyways?

01:13:45.054 --> 01:13:47.355
- I don't, she's just the
best songwriter I know,

01:13:47.457 --> 01:13:49.056
now get out of here.

01:13:52.729 --> 01:13:56.063
- Devin, your songwriter
just heard all that.

01:13:58.601 --> 01:14:01.335
- Harmony, hold up
I didn't mean to.

01:14:01.438 --> 01:14:02.703
- To what?

01:14:02.806 --> 01:14:03.571
To have that conversation
while the mics were on?

01:14:03.673 --> 01:14:04.472
- Baby it's not what you think.

01:14:04.574 --> 01:14:06.874
- Even if it is, I don't care.

01:14:06.976 --> 01:14:09.143
I don't know what I was thinking
coming back here with you,

01:14:09.245 --> 01:14:10.711
clearly I wasn't thinking.

01:14:10.814 --> 01:14:13.915
You know, you and I stopped
being right a long time ago.

01:14:14.017 --> 01:14:16.684
- Baby don't say that,
let's just please go inside.

01:14:16.786 --> 01:14:19.086
- No, Devin we're done,
we've been done, I just

01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:21.022
didn't want to admit it before.

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:22.890
It took me really
falling in love

01:14:22.992 --> 01:14:24.091
with someone else
to realize that.

01:14:24.194 --> 01:14:25.760
- Excuse me.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:27.995
- I love him.

01:14:28.097 --> 01:14:29.530
- Baby what are
you talking about?

01:14:30.433 --> 01:14:32.567
- I love him.

01:14:34.103 --> 01:14:35.169
Oh Dev.

01:14:36.773 --> 01:14:41.108
It's been interesting, thank
you for helping me realize

01:14:41.211 --> 01:14:43.878
that this isn't
what I want at all.

01:14:50.286 --> 01:14:51.919
- Hey you've reached
Julie's phone you know

01:14:52.021 --> 01:14:54.489
what to do, beep, just kidding.

01:14:56.359 --> 01:14:59.594
- Jules, Jules, turns
out I can't get you

01:14:59.696 --> 01:15:01.562
those VIP tickets after all,

01:15:01.664 --> 01:15:03.030
but you should tell your
friend that she doesn't

01:15:03.132 --> 01:15:05.967
want to see that lying,
cheating, conniving snail trail

01:15:06.069 --> 01:15:07.401
of a man anyway.

01:15:07.504 --> 01:15:10.972
The best part is
I don't even care!

01:15:11.074 --> 01:15:14.242
I think I've found someone
actually worth fighting for.

01:15:14.344 --> 01:15:16.143
Merry Christmas!

01:15:24.153 --> 01:15:25.152
So - Harmony! Ry!

01:15:25.255 --> 01:15:27.121
- Pam have you seen Luke?

01:15:27.223 --> 01:15:28.089
- By the stage on the left.

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:29.524
- Okay thank you.

01:15:31.094 --> 01:15:34.228
- Thanks for always showing
up to the Christmas Festival.

01:15:34.330 --> 01:15:37.064
Okay now please welcome
Clementine and Tyson.

01:15:39.102 --> 01:15:40.401
- Luke!

01:15:40.503 --> 01:15:42.236
- I'm kinda in the middle
of something right now.

01:15:42.338 --> 01:15:43.971
- I know, I know
and I am so sorry.

01:15:45.575 --> 01:15:47.108
- Shouldn't you be
at a concert in LA?

01:15:47.210 --> 01:15:48.409
- No I left.

01:15:48.511 --> 01:15:50.077
Look I know what I want.

01:15:51.714 --> 01:15:52.713
- Congratulations.

01:16:02.358 --> 01:16:04.425
- Luke, Harmony's back!

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:06.594
- I saw.

01:16:06.696 --> 01:16:08.029
- Well?

01:16:08.131 --> 01:16:09.030
- Well what?

01:16:09.132 --> 01:16:10.631
- What are you
gonna do about it?

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.199
- I'm gonna keep on working.

01:16:13.202 --> 01:16:13.935
- Don't be stupid.

01:16:16.306 --> 01:16:17.538
- Hey dad.

01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:18.606
- Harmony!

01:16:18.708 --> 01:16:19.473
What?

01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:22.910
What are you doing here?

01:16:23.012 --> 01:16:26.247
- I realized this is
where I wanted to be.

01:16:27.984 --> 01:16:28.749
- Are you okay?

01:16:29.619 --> 01:16:30.851
- Yeah.

01:16:38.294 --> 01:16:43.297
Listen dad, I'm really sorry
for not being here with you

01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:49.236
over the past few years,
I've been a little lost.

01:16:49.339 --> 01:16:52.473
- Oh no, you've got
nothing to be sorry about.

01:16:52.575 --> 01:16:54.008
- Let me finish.

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:57.878
Ever since mom died,
I've been running away

01:16:57.981 --> 01:16:58.913
and I haven't looked back.

01:16:59.015 --> 01:17:04.051
I think my heart was so broken

01:17:04.153 --> 01:17:06.787
that I wanted to pretend
like it didn't exist.

01:17:07.991 --> 01:17:12.193
And I was so mad at
you for moving on

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:14.228
when I couldn't even begin.

01:17:14.330 --> 01:17:16.230
- Hold on sweetheart
I never moved on.

01:17:19.335 --> 01:17:21.669
I never stopped
loving your mother,

01:17:21.771 --> 01:17:23.070
I still love your mother.

01:17:24.107 --> 01:17:24.939
Everyday.

01:17:27.477 --> 01:17:31.579
- I shoulda been here,
and I want to be here now.

01:17:31.681 --> 01:17:33.147
- You are here now.

01:17:35.718 --> 01:17:36.684
I couldn't be happier.

01:17:40.323 --> 01:17:42.223
- Oh and dad about Debbie.

01:17:42.325 --> 01:17:45.126
- Okay, no, no I'm
not gonna force ya

01:17:45.228 --> 01:17:47.128
to have a relationship.

01:17:47.230 --> 01:17:51.198
- No I was wrong she's
really wonderful,

01:17:51.300 --> 01:17:53.601
I would love to have a
relationship with her.

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:58.105
And if you love her the
way that I think you do,

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:00.474
I think you should marry her.

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:05.946
- You do?

01:18:07.350 --> 01:18:08.182
- Yes.

01:18:09.485 --> 01:18:11.619
Life is short dad, we
learned that the hard way.

01:18:12.522 --> 01:18:15.022
It just took me a little
longer to catch up.

01:18:21.564 --> 01:18:22.997
- What about you?

01:18:23.099 --> 01:18:24.465
- What about me?

01:18:25.868 --> 01:18:27.935
- You're not wearing the ring.

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:29.670
- Oh yeah, you noticed that huh?

01:18:31.274 --> 01:18:34.909
Well I know I don't need
to tell you but Devin and I

01:18:35.011 --> 01:18:37.011
weren't really a great fit.

01:18:38.281 --> 01:18:39.480
- You out grew him.

01:18:40.683 --> 01:18:42.583
- Yeah, I think I did.

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:47.488
And in the end we wanted
very different things.

01:18:49.192 --> 01:18:51.492
But it's okay, I'm home now.

01:18:53.663 --> 01:18:54.462
- You know

01:18:56.365 --> 01:19:01.001
there's a very good man that
also calls this town home?

01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:02.837
- Yeah, dad, I know where
you're going with this

01:19:02.939 --> 01:19:06.307
and unfortunately this isn't
a Hallmark Christmas fairytale

01:19:06.409 --> 01:19:07.341
okay?

01:19:08.711 --> 01:19:11.946
I thought he had feelings
for me but he doesn't.

01:19:14.650 --> 01:19:15.549
- He told you that?

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:17.785
- More or less.

01:19:21.624 --> 01:19:24.959
- What are you
gonna do about that?

01:19:25.061 --> 01:19:26.427
- What can I do?

01:19:28.131 --> 01:19:31.966
- How about something crazy?

01:19:37.140 --> 01:19:39.340
- Which brings to mind,
no Miracle Christmas Fes.

01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.312
Come here Harmony.

01:19:48.184 --> 01:19:50.584
- Hi, I'm Harmony.

01:19:52.889 --> 01:19:57.491
And I am so happy
to be back here

01:19:57.593 --> 01:19:59.660
in my hometown with all of you.

01:19:59.762 --> 01:20:03.531
Miracle really is the
best place for Christmas,

01:20:03.633 --> 01:20:06.433
and not just because
of all of this.

01:20:07.403 --> 01:20:10.271
But because of all of the
wonderful people here.

01:20:12.441 --> 01:20:15.075
Whether it's your
first time visiting,

01:20:15.178 --> 01:20:18.512
whether you've been
here forever, or whether

01:20:18.614 --> 01:20:21.348
you're returning after
you've lost your way,

01:20:22.785 --> 01:20:24.952
the people of Miracle
make this place home.

01:20:26.522 --> 01:20:31.292
I wrote this song with
someone truly exceptional.

01:20:31.394 --> 01:20:35.796
Someone who reminded
me what it is to love,

01:20:35.898 --> 01:20:38.365
who taught me to
open my heart again,

01:20:38.467 --> 01:20:41.669
and who showed me the
real beauty of Christmas.
