[audience whoos]

01:16.117 --> 01:17.118
Thank you.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.665
I was in the casino yesterday
with a friend of mine

01:22.749 --> 01:24.501
and he asked me
an interesting question.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.670
He goes, "How can you tell
which women out here are hookers?"

01:28.338 --> 01:29.881
And I thought about it and I'm like,

01:29.964 --> 01:32.717
"Well, normally if I smile
and she smiles back...

01:33.760 --> 01:35.762
[laughter]

01:37.388 --> 01:39.140
-[man whoos]
-that's the tell."

01:39.265 --> 01:40.600
[audience laughs]

01:41.017 --> 01:44.187
You don't need to send in the police,
big investigation, I'll handle this.

01:45.063 --> 01:45.897
"Hello."

01:45.980 --> 01:46.856
"Hi."

01:46.940 --> 01:47.982
"She's one."

01:48.066 --> 01:49.567
[laughing]

01:53.238 --> 01:55.115
I was watching a documentary

01:55.615 --> 01:58.284
recently about Flat Earthers

01:58.910 --> 02:00.411
that was fascinating.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.664
I don't know if anybody saw this,
there are people

02:02.747 --> 02:04.082
who believe the Earth is flat.

02:04.165 --> 02:06.668
-The documentary is called <i>Assholes.
-</i>[audience laughs]

02:07.877 --> 02:08.878
[applause]

02:11.131 --> 02:12.340
But I had to watch it.

02:12.423 --> 02:14.884
I'm like, I have to see if people
really believe this.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.012
And not only do they believe it,
they're adamant and they tell people,

02:18.096 --> 02:19.764
like, "You've been lied to
your whole life.

02:19.848 --> 02:21.516
They're lying about the shape
of the Earth."

02:21.599 --> 02:24.477
And all I keep thinking is,
"Why would anybody lie...

02:24.561 --> 02:25.478
[laughing]

02:25.770 --> 02:28.022
about the shape of the Earth? Who wins?"

02:28.106 --> 02:29.315
[continued laughter]

02:29.524 --> 02:31.442
When did this start?
Years ago, someone's like,

02:31.526 --> 02:33.611
"Look, I know it's flat,
you know it's flat,

02:33.695 --> 02:35.613
but if we can convince people..."

02:37.073 --> 02:39.075
[audience laughs]

02:43.746 --> 02:46.332
I'm dying to talk to a Flat Earther.

02:46.416 --> 02:49.043
There's so many questions.
Like, I'm trying to go with it.

02:49.127 --> 02:52.630
Maybe it is-- If it's flat, what happens
when you look underneath it?

02:52.714 --> 02:55.592
What do you see? Just a bunch of
Australians and Chinese people

02:55.675 --> 02:57.135
hanging by their feet like bats?

02:57.218 --> 02:59.220
[laughter and applause]

03:01.014 --> 03:02.932
I mean, if it was flat
the water would run off it

03:03.016 --> 03:05.768
and horses would fall off it
because animals are stupid.

03:05.852 --> 03:07.103
[laughing]

03:08.104 --> 03:10.899
But they have an answer for that.
The Flat Earthers have an answer.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.610
They say the reason the water stays on
and nothing falls off

03:13.693 --> 03:17.572
is because we are surrounded by
a snow-covered mountain range.

03:18.239 --> 03:19.490
And I was like, "Oh, all right.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.326
I was worried
you were going to sound stupid."

03:21.409 --> 03:23.328
[audience laughs]

03:24.204 --> 03:26.372
That makes perfect sense,
that we live on a serving tray

03:26.456 --> 03:28.833
-surrounded by mashed potatoes.
-[continued laughter]

03:33.546 --> 03:34.589
But they're not hateable.

03:34.672 --> 03:36.883
I enjoy-- I didn't dislike them at all,

03:36.966 --> 03:38.843
because a lot of conspiracy theorists
annoy me

03:38.927 --> 03:41.095
because you're denying
someone else's pain.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.348
9/11 conspiracy, Newtown conspiracy...

03:43.431 --> 03:45.808
They're denying that somebody else
has had a tragedy.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.560
These guys don't hurt anybody.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.812
No one is mad that they're talking about
the Earth...

03:49.896 --> 03:51.564
They're not like,
"Hey, the Earth is flat."

03:51.648 --> 03:53.858
-There's no one going, "Shut the fuck up!
-[laughter]

03:53.942 --> 03:56.986
I haven't sold a globe in six months.
Shut up!"

03:59.948 --> 04:03.159
Here's my problem with the whole theory
and conspiracies in general.

04:03.243 --> 04:04.118
If it's true,

04:04.535 --> 04:08.289
do you understand how many people
have to be in on the lie?

04:09.249 --> 04:12.168
Like, Flat Earth is by far
the biggest conspiracy

04:12.252 --> 04:13.378
ever conceived of.

04:13.461 --> 04:16.422
Because there's millions of people,
not just the government,

04:16.506 --> 04:17.340
not just the NSA,

04:17.423 --> 04:18.633
not just the FBI...

04:18.716 --> 04:20.969
People you wouldn't think of
that have to be involved.

04:21.052 --> 04:21.970
Boat captains.

04:22.053 --> 04:24.722
-Every boat captain who's ever lived
-[laughing]

04:24.806 --> 04:27.392
has to be sat down,
this has to be explained to...

04:28.101 --> 04:30.103
[continued laughter]

04:30.812 --> 04:33.147
I don't even mean just naval admirals.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.401
I mean every white trash
Carnival Cruise captain.

04:36.484 --> 04:38.486
[laughing and applause]

04:39.279 --> 04:40.697
They have to sit 'em down and go,

04:40.780 --> 04:43.491
"Look, you're going to be sailing
across the ocean.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.868
You're gonna see mountains.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.036
[laughter]

04:47.328 --> 04:50.456
Just... [mimics horn]
turn around, come back.

04:51.457 --> 04:53.459
-Don't say anything."
-[laughing]

04:55.920 --> 04:59.882
I saw a great documentary on Ted Bundy.
Did anybody see that?

04:59.966 --> 05:01.342
-That was a four-hour...
-[cheering]

05:01.426 --> 05:04.053
-four-part Ted Bundy documentary.
-[applause]

05:04.721 --> 05:08.516
And they said originally he wanted to be
an attorney or a politician,

05:08.891 --> 05:11.269
and when I heard that,
the whole thing kind of made sense.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.186
[laughter]

05:12.312 --> 05:14.605
Like, all right, he actually took
the more admirable route.

05:15.148 --> 05:17.108
[audience laughs]

05:19.027 --> 05:21.112
-[cheering]
-[man] Yeah, he did!

05:21.279 --> 05:22.238
[applause]

05:23.406 --> 05:24.449
[man 2] Yeah!

05:25.908 --> 05:30.288
And I've seen about 30 documentaries
on Ted Bundy and I got to be honest,

05:30.371 --> 05:33.416
I'm a little sick and tired
of the hero worship

05:33.499 --> 05:35.543
we have of serial killers in this country.

05:35.626 --> 05:37.670
I say "we"
'cause I've been guilty of it, too.

05:37.754 --> 05:41.466
But you can tell it's more than
just curiosity and voyeurism.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.383
It's admiration.

05:42.467 --> 05:45.094
You can tell by the language used
in the documentaries.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.264
They don't talk about Ted Bundy the way
they should talk about Ted Bundy.

05:48.348 --> 05:49.974
If they were speaking about him honestly,

05:50.058 --> 05:53.519
every sentence would start with,
"And then this piece of shit..."

05:53.644 --> 05:55.146
[audience laughs]

05:57.523 --> 05:58.441
But they don't do that.

05:58.524 --> 06:01.861
They give the obligatory,
"He was wicked, he was evil..."

06:01.944 --> 06:06.407
But then they find almost
admirable qualities and they harp on them.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.909
First of all, his intellect.

06:07.992 --> 06:10.328
They can't stop talking about
his intellect,

06:10.411 --> 06:12.705
which was overrated.
He was not that bright.

06:12.789 --> 06:16.125
They're like,
"Ted Bundy was so intelligent,

06:16.209 --> 06:17.794
he escaped from jail twice..."

06:17.877 --> 06:19.879
Do you know how he escaped from jail
the first time?

06:19.962 --> 06:22.590
The window was open and he jumped out.

06:22.673 --> 06:23.633
[laughter]

06:25.843 --> 06:27.261
That's how a cat or a bird

06:27.345 --> 06:28.888
-would escape from prison.
-[laughing]

06:30.723 --> 06:32.558
You're not a mastermind if you're in jail

06:32.642 --> 06:35.561
and you see an open window
and you're like, "Freedom is that way!"

06:35.728 --> 06:36.979
[continued laughter]

06:37.522 --> 06:38.940
They called him a genius.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.943
'Cause I think they like the idea
of the wicked genius.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.153
They actually said,
"Ted Bundy was a genius,

06:44.237 --> 06:45.738
he acted as his own attorney."

06:47.031 --> 06:48.491
They executed him.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.576
[laughter]

06:53.162 --> 06:54.330
He sucked as a lawyer.

06:54.414 --> 06:58.835
You're not a genius if you get the worst--
He couldn't have done worse. He got the...

06:58.960 --> 07:00.962
[continued laughter]

07:01.129 --> 07:04.006
If he had hired an orangutan
to represent him,

07:04.924 --> 07:09.345
and it just shit in its own hand
and mushed it in the face of the jury,

07:10.221 --> 07:12.014
it would have gotten the same sentence

07:12.098 --> 07:14.142
-Ted got making an effort.
-[laughing]

07:14.684 --> 07:16.686
[applause and cheering]

07:18.438 --> 07:22.567
And collectively can we agree?
Stop harping on his appearance.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.527
He was an average-looking guy,

07:24.610 --> 07:27.738
but they can't stop talking about,
"Oh, my God, he was charming.

07:27.822 --> 07:29.532
Ted Bundy was so handsome."

07:29.615 --> 07:30.450
No, he wasn't!

07:30.533 --> 07:33.744
-He was handsome in that pool of people.
-[audience laughs]

07:36.122 --> 07:36.956
Okay?

07:37.039 --> 07:41.002
In the group of men who have murdered
and raped 40 or more women...

07:41.169 --> 07:42.879
[continued laughter]

07:43.254 --> 07:44.505
Ted's a catch.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.591
[laughing and applause]

07:48.384 --> 07:49.552
Ted's a nine.

07:51.345 --> 07:53.806
But how about some kind,
understanding words

07:53.931 --> 07:55.016
for the rest of us, huh?

07:55.099 --> 07:57.143
How about a little leeway
for other average men?

07:57.226 --> 07:58.769
I realize I'm only a five,

07:58.853 --> 08:01.355
but I never hit a girl with a hammer
before I fucked her.

08:01.439 --> 08:03.357
[laughter and applause]

08:03.441 --> 08:05.359
[whooing]

08:10.531 --> 08:11.616
You know what's interesting?

08:11.699 --> 08:16.120
I've seen 30-plus Ted Bundy documentaries,
and after all those documentaries,

08:16.204 --> 08:20.082
not one article is written saying
maybe it's detrimental for the culture.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.294
Not one social media campaign is started

08:23.377 --> 08:26.172
attempting to punish
the directors or the producers

08:26.255 --> 08:28.841
or to criticize them for
making these documentaries.

08:28.966 --> 08:30.343
Everybody is okay with it.

08:30.426 --> 08:32.470
But if Bill Maher does a racist joke,

08:32.553 --> 08:35.097
or Louis makes fun of
the Parkland shooting,

08:35.181 --> 08:39.852
or Chappelle makes fun of LGBT issues,
people lose their fucking minds.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.145
-Oh, my God.
-[cheering]

08:41.229 --> 08:42.813
[applause and whooing]

08:43.064 --> 08:45.107
"Comedy has gone too far.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.069
Comedians have got to stop.

08:48.152 --> 08:51.072
This is damaging the culture,
cancel these comedians.

08:51.155 --> 08:53.533
Hold on, I'd like to hear Ted's take.",

08:53.699 --> 08:55.701
[audience laughs]

08:57.453 --> 08:58.871
It's fucking psychotic.

08:58.955 --> 09:01.040
I'm not saying the documentaries
shouldn't exist,

09:01.123 --> 09:04.085
I'm just pointing out the mental illness
the country is going through

09:04.168 --> 09:07.505
thinking that humor is somehow
contributing to dangerous behavior.

09:07.588 --> 09:08.798
-[woman] Yes!
-It's not.

09:08.881 --> 09:12.385
And they're saying things like,
"Well, comedians should punch up."

09:12.468 --> 09:14.637
How come comedians are the only ones
hearing this shit?

09:14.720 --> 09:16.764
How come authors don't have to punch up?

09:16.847 --> 09:19.183
Stephen King kills children in his books.

09:19.267 --> 09:20.601
[laughter and cheering]

09:20.851 --> 09:24.355
Do you know how pissed off
people would be if <i>It</i> was a comedy?

09:24.522 --> 09:26.357
[oohs and laughter]

09:27.275 --> 09:28.693
[applause]

09:30.152 --> 09:32.738
How come actors don't have to punch up?

09:32.822 --> 09:35.700
They'll go back and grab a comedian's
tweet from ten years ago

09:35.783 --> 09:37.076
and try to crucify him.

09:37.159 --> 09:38.786
They never do that to actors.

09:38.869 --> 09:40.037
You can play any role,

09:40.121 --> 09:42.498
no matter how barbaric,
and it's totally acceptable.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.585
-Zac Efron played Ted Bundy.
-[laughter]

09:45.793 --> 09:46.877
And people are fine with it.

09:46.961 --> 09:50.131
If you do a rape joke, people are like,
"You're a pig, don't ever talk about that.

09:50.214 --> 09:51.382
Zac, great job.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.593
[audience laughs]

09:53.718 --> 09:57.179
You really look like you...
Did you rape and kill that girl?

09:57.263 --> 10:00.558
Ah! You really look like you raped her
and killed her. [chuckles]

10:00.641 --> 10:03.144
My girlfriend threw up.
Man, you are an artist."

10:03.269 --> 10:04.729
[continued laughter]

10:05.938 --> 10:09.191
And then they give you this bullshit,
"Well, if you make a joke about something,

10:09.275 --> 10:11.027
it creates and fosters an environment

10:11.110 --> 10:13.154
where that behavior
somehow seems acceptable

10:13.237 --> 10:15.823
and it might encourage somebody..."
Which is such shit.

10:15.906 --> 10:18.451
No rape has ever been caused
because of something

10:18.534 --> 10:19.785
a stand-up comedian has said.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.538
It's just not the way it works.
I've never heard a rape victim going,

10:22.622 --> 10:24.749
"It was terrible, he came in,
he was laughing."

10:24.874 --> 10:26.459
[audience laughs]

10:32.048 --> 10:33.758
You know what might inspire a rapist?

10:33.841 --> 10:37.386
Thirty documentaries about a rapist,
where they call him a handsome genius.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.430
-That might be encouraging to a rapist.
-[cheering]

10:40.556 --> 10:42.892
[applause and whooing]

10:45.936 --> 10:47.980
And, you know, I am single at the moment.

10:48.397 --> 10:49.982
-[laughter]
-Um...

10:50.566 --> 10:52.777
Probably not the best segway into dating.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.320
[continued laughter]

10:55.696 --> 10:59.742
But, you know, Me Too, the movement
definitely has validity to it,

10:59.825 --> 11:03.913
but it's made dating a little bit scary.
Like, every man is nervous.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.415
And it's not the obvious things
that scare men,

11:06.499 --> 11:07.917
it's not what a lot of people think.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.002
We're not wondering,
"Gee, did I ever rape somebody?

11:10.086 --> 11:12.463
Did I ever drug somebody's drink
and assault--" Of course not!

11:12.546 --> 11:13.673
Unless you've done that shit,

11:13.756 --> 11:15.758
-you're not thinking you've done it.
-[laughter]

11:15.883 --> 11:18.427
Most men are now listening
to when women are talking

11:18.511 --> 11:20.304
and you're telling us
these internal monologues

11:20.388 --> 11:22.014
you were having on dates

11:22.098 --> 11:24.100
that a lot of us
might not have been aware of.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.018
You're saying things like,
"I was on a date.

11:26.435 --> 11:27.395
It was okay.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.188
I was slightly uncomfortable.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.189
We were kissing

11:30.272 --> 11:31.691
and he put my hand on his penis

11:31.774 --> 11:33.901
and I didn't like it
but I didn't say anything,

11:34.485 --> 11:36.153
and then he took it out and I...

11:36.237 --> 11:38.072
[stammers] I touched it
but I wanted to go home,

11:38.155 --> 11:39.281
I was a little frightened."

11:39.365 --> 11:41.659
And you're being honest,
but guys are like,

11:41.742 --> 11:43.661
"Whoa, I didn't fucking... I had no idea."

11:43.744 --> 11:46.997
I was taught no means no.
So you look out for the word "no."

11:47.123 --> 11:49.375
If you're on a date,
she pulls a whistle out of her purse,

11:49.458 --> 11:51.001
be a gentleman, go home.

11:51.085 --> 11:52.294
[audience laughs]

11:52.545 --> 11:54.547
[cheering and applause]

11:58.050 --> 12:02.096
And the subtleties of what is acceptable
changes with every generation.

12:02.179 --> 12:05.891
Like, how many of our grandfathers would
have made it through a Me Too discussion?

12:06.183 --> 12:07.685
[laughter]

12:08.227 --> 12:10.896
You ever hear your grandparents talk
about how they met?

12:10.980 --> 12:13.023
-It's a horrifying story.
-[audience laughs]

12:13.441 --> 12:15.609
"Grandma, did you love him
when you first met him?"

12:15.693 --> 12:16.652
[frail] "No."

12:16.777 --> 12:18.028
[laughing]

12:18.529 --> 12:19.864
"Why'd you go out with him?"

12:19.947 --> 12:21.991
-[frail] "I was afraid.
-[continued laughter]

12:22.241 --> 12:24.410
He wouldn't take no for an answer.

12:24.493 --> 12:28.539
He kept showing up at my job drunk
and starting fires in the hallway. I...

12:29.957 --> 12:33.753
I was seeing a fellow, your grandfather
put him in a coma with a wrench."

12:33.878 --> 12:35.254
[audience laughs]

12:36.046 --> 12:39.133
And we hear that and we're like,
"He loved you. How romantic!"

12:39.216 --> 12:40.259
[continued laughter]

12:40.342 --> 12:42.178
[whooing and applause]

12:43.053 --> 12:45.222
And I feel so good right now.

12:45.306 --> 12:47.016
I came out of a horrible depression.

12:47.099 --> 12:49.268
I know a lot of people go through it.
It's not uncommon.

12:49.351 --> 12:51.479
Anyone go through that type of depression

12:51.562 --> 12:54.482
where you got to give yourself a pep talk
every morning? You know the type?

12:54.565 --> 12:56.484
Where you wake up every morning
and you gotta go,

12:56.567 --> 12:57.651
"Belt around the waist,

12:57.735 --> 12:59.570
-not around the neck."
-[laughter and oohs]

13:00.404 --> 13:01.447
[Jim chuckles]

13:02.698 --> 13:04.825
Wow, more than I would have thought.
[laughs] All right.

13:04.950 --> 13:05.951
[laughing]

13:06.118 --> 13:09.246
Or the train pulls into the station,
you gotta gently back up against the wall.

13:09.330 --> 13:10.831
"Don't do it. Don't do it.

13:11.540 --> 13:14.460
You got to wipe your hard drive first.
Don't do it."

13:14.543 --> 13:15.711
[laughter]

13:15.920 --> 13:17.046
[man] Yeah!

13:19.423 --> 13:20.841
And I'm glad I didn't do it.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.927
So, please, don't think I'm up here
killing myself.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.804
I'm just spitballing ideas with you.

13:24.929 --> 13:26.889
[audience laughs]

13:27.807 --> 13:30.392
First of all, I feel too good
to even consider that.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.978
But, second of all, I've always
been scared, not of being dead,

13:33.062 --> 13:35.397
but of attempting suicide and failing.

13:35.898 --> 13:37.775
-[oohs]
-'Cause you're never in better shape

13:37.858 --> 13:40.194
-after a failed suicide attempt.
-[laughter]

13:40.486 --> 13:42.947
No one's ever like, "You look great,
have you been to the gym?"

13:43.030 --> 13:44.865
Like, "No, I tried to kill myself!"
"Fuck!

13:44.949 --> 13:46.033
[laughing]

13:46.325 --> 13:47.535
You really look good."

13:49.119 --> 13:50.412
There's been dark moments.

13:50.496 --> 13:51.413
There's been moments

13:51.497 --> 13:54.875
where if in my mind I knew it would
be fast, I would have done it.

13:54.959 --> 13:56.669
There's been a lot of times
where if I knew

13:56.752 --> 13:59.672
that I could just jump
in front of a train... Train! Dead!

13:59.755 --> 14:01.841
I would have taken that option, but...

14:02.258 --> 14:05.803
even in those sad moments,
I knew I don't have that kind of luck.

14:06.095 --> 14:08.097
-Um...
-[audience laughs]

14:08.514 --> 14:09.765
I'm not graceful.

14:09.849 --> 14:12.643
It would... Something would go wrong,
you know, it wouldn't be quick.

14:12.726 --> 14:13.811
Train! Dead!

14:13.894 --> 14:16.063
"Nope, it's dragging me.
It's dragging me."

14:16.146 --> 14:17.273
[uproarious laughter]

14:17.356 --> 14:18.732
[applause]

14:19.191 --> 14:22.152
My fucking face would be bouncing
over the railroad tracks.

14:22.236 --> 14:23.487
[continued laughter]

14:23.779 --> 14:25.030
They'd find me a mile down,

14:25.114 --> 14:26.574
crumpled under a subway car.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.284
"Relax, sir. We're going to get you out!"

14:28.367 --> 14:30.202
"Oh, that's great news, fellas.

14:30.286 --> 14:31.245
[laughing]

14:31.453 --> 14:33.914
I have no feet or shoulders."

14:40.254 --> 14:43.841
And I can see when I do this bit,
a couple of people are kind of like...

14:43.924 --> 14:45.384
[mimics uneasy groan]

14:45.551 --> 14:47.678
"Come on, Jim, shoot yourself.

14:47.761 --> 14:49.889
[audience laughs]

14:50.055 --> 14:51.849
Why make everybody late for work?"

14:51.932 --> 14:54.018
[continued laughter]

14:57.730 --> 14:59.189
Now, I would never shoot myself.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.191
First of all, I don't own a gun.

15:01.942 --> 15:03.527
Look, I believe in the Second Amendment.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.738
If you are mentally
and emotionally qualified,

15:05.821 --> 15:07.656
you should be able to have a firearm.

15:07.740 --> 15:11.493
I remove myself from that equation
because I know I can't handle it.

15:11.577 --> 15:15.205
I spike too high and I dip too low,
and I would misuse it.

15:15.289 --> 15:18.125
Even in good times.
You know, to celebrate, like I know...

15:18.208 --> 15:19.293
[laughter]

15:19.543 --> 15:20.669
it would be a problem.

15:21.670 --> 15:24.006
They wouldn't even sell me one.
I'd walk in, they'd be like,

15:24.089 --> 15:26.967
"What model would you like?"
"I don't know. Let me see how it fits."

15:27.092 --> 15:29.053
[oohs and laughter]

15:36.852 --> 15:38.938
But again, I would never shoot myself,

15:39.188 --> 15:43.317
simply because too many people
try to shoot themselves and live.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.402
-[yells of agreement]
-We've all seen those stories.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.196
Guy's wife is having an affair,

15:47.279 --> 15:49.865
he gets depressed
and puts a pistol under his chin,

15:49.949 --> 15:52.701
blows out the back of his mouth,
the back of his eyes,

15:52.785 --> 15:54.244
wakes up in the hospital in a month.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.872
-You can't eat, you're blind...
-[woman] Right!

15:57.039 --> 16:01.126
At that point,
you have to feel like such a silly goose.

16:01.210 --> 16:02.670
[audience laughs]

16:04.922 --> 16:07.299
'Cause you know she's not coming back now.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.426
[oohs and laughter]

16:11.136 --> 16:13.847
If she was fucking other people
when you had a face...

16:14.181 --> 16:16.183
[cheers and applause]

16:19.937 --> 16:24.149
Hose in the exhaust pipe
seems kind of quick and easy, doesn't it?

16:24.233 --> 16:26.652
You just kind of zone out and fade away.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.362
If I ever killed myself that way,

16:28.445 --> 16:31.949
I would wind up putting on a song
that I have no attachment to

16:32.032 --> 16:34.535
just to fuck my family up
for the rest of their lives.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.787
-[laughing]
-I'd write, like, "Listen to the words."

16:36.870 --> 16:39.581
It would be, like,
"Alejandro" by Lady Gaga and I just...

16:39.665 --> 16:41.625
-[audience laughs]
-[Jim chuckles]

16:42.501 --> 16:45.045
For the next 30 years,
[frantic] "What was he trying to tell us?

16:45.129 --> 16:46.505
-I don't know!"
-[laughter]

16:51.885 --> 16:55.514
Hanging yourself,
now that seems like a really, really...

16:55.723 --> 16:58.851
That's a dicey way to go
because, again, that's probably

16:58.934 --> 16:59.977
how I would do it,

17:00.060 --> 17:01.979
but there's different schools of thought
on that.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.898
Like, some guys hang themselves
and they kick the chair out.

17:05.024 --> 17:07.151
I am not that type of person.

17:07.234 --> 17:08.360
I'm not that committed.

17:08.485 --> 17:12.072
'Cause I know that I'd be swinging,
trying to grab the chair, like... "Ah!

17:12.156 --> 17:13.991
-[laughter]
-Come on, now. I was kidding!"

17:18.412 --> 17:19.663
I'm not committed enough.

17:20.122 --> 17:23.792
Aaron Hernandez of the Patriots,
when he hung himself in jail,

17:23.876 --> 17:25.961
he was doing life in prison,
he was never getting out.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.129
He really,

17:27.588 --> 17:29.757
really, I mean, made sure
that they couldn't rescue him.

17:29.840 --> 17:32.634
He put cardboard in the door
so they could not save him,

17:32.718 --> 17:36.847
he squirted shampoo on the floor
because this way if the guards came in

17:36.930 --> 17:40.017
they would not be able...  Or maybe just
to amuse himself as he's dying.

17:40.100 --> 17:42.311
It's like watching a Three Stooges sketch.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.396
-[imitates the Stooges, chuckles]
-[audience laughs]

17:46.315 --> 17:47.649
But he really planned it.

17:47.733 --> 17:48.650
I was in awe.

17:48.734 --> 17:51.904
I'm like, "That is the level of commitment
that made him

17:51.987 --> 17:54.364
-such a great football player."
-[audience laughs]

17:54.490 --> 17:56.575
[cheering and applause]

18:00.454 --> 18:03.457
And I did these jokes and a woman
came up to me after a show,

18:03.540 --> 18:06.126
and she goes, "Can I talk to you
about those suicide jokes?"

18:06.335 --> 18:07.753
And immediately I was annoyed

18:07.836 --> 18:10.798
because I figure she's going to try
to rescue me, which I don't need,

18:10.881 --> 18:13.092
or she's going to try to lecture me on how

18:13.175 --> 18:15.260
"Suicide isn't funny
and you shouldn't joke about it."

18:15.344 --> 18:17.304
I already know suicide's not funny.

18:17.387 --> 18:19.932
A subject doesn't have to be funny
on its own

18:20.015 --> 18:21.725
in order to be talked
about on a stage.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.603
-That's not how comedy works.
-[cheering and applause]

18:28.232 --> 18:30.776
You're all going to leave here
exactly as you walked in.

18:30.859 --> 18:33.904
None of you are gonna change who you are.
You're not going to walk out saying,

18:33.987 --> 18:35.781
"I didn't realize suicide
was so hilarious.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.325
-[laughter]
-I can't stop smiling thinking of

18:38.408 --> 18:40.786
-all the lives it shatters."
-[continued laughter]

18:42.079 --> 18:44.373
So she's like "I want to talk to you."
And I'm like, "What?"

18:44.456 --> 18:48.252
And she goes, "Have you heard about people
committing suicide in convertibles,

18:48.335 --> 18:51.004
where they're tying a rope around a tree,

18:51.088 --> 18:53.882
and the other end around their neck
and they floor it?"

18:54.216 --> 18:56.051
[audience laughs]

18:58.762 --> 19:00.472
[applause]

19:01.932 --> 19:02.808
Thank you.

19:03.392 --> 19:05.185
[uproarious laughter]

19:07.729 --> 19:09.606
And the last thing I will say,

19:09.690 --> 19:12.693
is we're a very divided country
and it's kind of

19:12.776 --> 19:14.403
startling how divided we are

19:14.486 --> 19:16.572
and I didn't realize how divided we are.

19:16.655 --> 19:19.158
I never realized how much
people didn't like each other

19:19.241 --> 19:22.953
until I was on a dating app
and I saw the political ideology

19:23.036 --> 19:24.955
taking precedent over everything else.

19:25.038 --> 19:27.416
Fifteen different women had things
on their on their profile,

19:27.499 --> 19:31.587
like, "Hey, if you voted for Trump
don't swipe on my profile."

19:32.546 --> 19:36.717
And I'm like, "Wow, do people care
that much about who you voted for?"

19:36.800 --> 19:38.468
-But, I guess they do, right?
-[woman] Yeah.

19:38.552 --> 19:40.095
Like, I didn't happen to vote for Trump,

19:40.179 --> 19:42.764
but if I had voted for him,
and I wanted to have sex with you,

19:42.848 --> 19:43.765
I would lie.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.809
[audience laughs]

19:46.435 --> 19:47.686
[applause]

19:48.145 --> 19:50.898
You're really overvaluing
politics in my life.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.567
Like, what do you think?
You're going to slide your panties off,

19:53.650 --> 19:55.235
and I'm gonna be like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa,

19:55.319 --> 19:57.821
back on till we talk about this trade deal
with China."

19:57.905 --> 19:59.781
[laughter]

20:00.532 --> 20:02.075
