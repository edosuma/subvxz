WEBVTT

02:19.757 --> 02:21.391
Where's Jotham?

02:22.026 --> 02:24.327
Calm yourself boy.

02:24.361 --> 02:25.428
You've had your turn.

02:26.130 --> 02:28.398
He will join you presently.

02:28.431 --> 02:30.567
Why not kill us with
the rest of them?

02:30.600 --> 02:33.570
When you catch a beast,
you hang it up to tan.

02:34.604 --> 02:36.741
Examples must be made.

02:36.774 --> 02:38.475
Get back here.

02:38.508 --> 02:39.342
Longinues!

02:40.044 --> 02:40.878
Longinus!

03:01.799 --> 03:02.632
Dismas?

03:16.546 --> 03:17.581
Dismas?

03:18.916 --> 03:20.651
You look like an angel.

03:21.752 --> 03:23.386
Where are your brothers?

03:24.922 --> 03:25.923
Where are we?

03:27.158 --> 03:28.525
Shh...

03:28.558 --> 03:29.894
It's okay, mother.

03:29.927 --> 03:32.596
We're home, in the stable.

03:33.463 --> 03:34.866
You've been sleeping.

03:34.899 --> 03:36.701
Aram is right here.

03:39.670 --> 03:40.671
And Jotham?

03:40.705 --> 03:43.540
He sat by your side all night.

03:43.573 --> 03:46.978
Oh my sweet boys, you
truly are my angels.

03:48.746 --> 03:49.981
Father should have been here.

03:50.014 --> 03:53.050
Your father will return to us.

03:53.084 --> 03:54.484
It's been months!

03:54.517 --> 03:58.622
Dismas, your father,
he's a good man.

03:58.656 --> 04:01.558
He may be a man,
but he isn't good.

04:01.591 --> 04:05.096
Jehovah would have you forgive.

04:05.129 --> 04:07.932
I will never forgive him.

04:07.965 --> 04:09.901
He left us.

04:09.934 --> 04:14.205
He left us to go get
drunk all the time.

04:14.238 --> 04:18.575
Not everyone
deserves forgiveness.

04:32.757 --> 04:34.692
Let's try here.

04:50.607 --> 04:51.208
What is it?

04:51.242 --> 04:52.743
Brother, tell me,

04:52.777 --> 04:54.812
do you have any
rooms for the night?

04:55.980 --> 04:57.647
You are out of luck, my friend.

04:57.682 --> 04:59.684
We've been overbooked for days.

04:59.717 --> 05:01.018
It's the census!

05:01.052 --> 05:04.121
Sir, my wife, she is with child.

05:04.155 --> 05:05.923
She's about to give birth.

05:05.957 --> 05:06.924
Surely you can make some...

05:06.958 --> 05:08.159
Boy!

05:08.192 --> 05:10.962
There is no room for
you, or your wife.

05:10.995 --> 05:12.797
You will have to make
camp on the hillside

05:12.830 --> 05:14.699
with the other late arrivals.

05:16.633 --> 05:18.635
It's okay, God will provide.

05:19.602 --> 05:20.805
Sir!

05:20.838 --> 05:22.073
We have some room
in the stables.

05:22.106 --> 05:23.540
A stable?

05:23.573 --> 05:24.742
Yes sir.

05:24.775 --> 05:28.112
I tend the stable for Mister
Piram so he lets us stay there.

05:28.145 --> 05:30.181
You are very kind,
what is your name?

05:30.214 --> 05:31.048
Dismas.

05:35.653 --> 05:37.520
And this is my brother Jotham.

05:37.554 --> 05:38.521
Hello, Jotham.

05:38.555 --> 05:39.556
Hello.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.691
Joseph...

05:40.725 --> 05:41.759
There is not much time.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.060
We must hurry, you lead the way.

05:52.602 --> 05:54.939
Mother, this is Joseph and Mary.

05:54.972 --> 05:56.539
They had nowhere to go.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.075
I had to help them.

05:58.109 --> 05:59.777
She's going to have a baby.

06:00.845 --> 06:01.611
I can see.

06:02.847 --> 06:04.982
Of course we'll help.

06:05.016 --> 06:06.317
This is my mother.

06:06.350 --> 06:09.552
She's unwell, but
can still help.

06:11.155 --> 06:11.956
Are you sick?

06:13.657 --> 06:14.524
Nothing to fear.

06:14.557 --> 06:17.895
I had a child of my
own not too long ago.

06:17.928 --> 06:19.230
I have yet to fully recover.

06:19.263 --> 06:22.599
Your boy, Dismas,
he's a generous host.

06:22.632 --> 06:26.137
He's a good boy, my
blessing from Jehovah.

06:26.170 --> 06:30.141
Today, Serah, he is a
blessing to us as well.

06:31.709 --> 06:32.777
Oh!

06:37.348 --> 06:38.916
Bethlehem.

06:38.949 --> 06:40.617
The town of David.

06:40.651 --> 06:41.652
We have arrived.

06:46.957 --> 06:48.092
He's beautiful, Mary.

06:49.093 --> 06:49.927
He's perfect.

06:51.062 --> 06:52.629
What will you call him?

06:52.663 --> 06:54.597
His name is Yeshua.

06:55.699 --> 06:56.333
Yeshua.

06:57.634 --> 06:58.536
Salvation.

07:00.671 --> 07:01.305
It's lovely.

07:04.742 --> 07:07.044
Mother, go lie down.

07:07.078 --> 07:09.246
I can take care of our guests.

07:09.280 --> 07:13.184
Oh, you're so manly.

07:15.019 --> 07:16.353
Allow me to help you.

07:16.387 --> 07:19.156
It's the least I can do
to repay your kindness.

07:24.028 --> 07:24.862
Come on.

07:26.297 --> 07:27.665
Here is fine.

07:28.799 --> 07:32.203
Serah, may God's
grace abound to you

07:32.236 --> 07:34.271
for all you've done
for my family and me.

07:36.941 --> 07:38.876
Shalom.
Shalom.

07:43.714 --> 07:46.350
You have done so much
for us tonight, Dismas.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.687
I pray one day we can
repay you and your family

07:49.720 --> 07:51.722
if you are ever
in a time of need.

07:51.755 --> 07:55.092
Your father would be very
proud of you, Dismas.

07:56.093 --> 07:58.929
I don't speak of my father.

07:58.963 --> 08:00.131
Why?

08:00.164 --> 08:01.866
Why don't you speak
of your father?

08:01.899 --> 08:04.902
He was not a good man.

08:04.935 --> 08:07.138
All men fall short, Dismas.

08:07.171 --> 08:11.675
That's why we must depend
on Jehovah for forgiveness.

08:11.709 --> 08:14.311
You think everyone
deserves forgiveness?

08:14.345 --> 08:17.681
I don't think anyone
deserves forgiveness.

08:17.715 --> 08:19.783
That's why they
call it forgiveness.

08:19.817 --> 08:22.753
You and I, we need
forgiveness, too.

08:28.125 --> 08:29.693
I'll see what's going on.

08:33.998 --> 08:35.399
Shalom.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.001
How may I help you, sirs?

08:37.034 --> 08:39.703
We are sorry to disturb
you at this hour.

08:39.737 --> 08:40.905
We are weary from our travel

08:40.938 --> 08:43.140
and would like to
rest for a few hours.

08:43.174 --> 08:45.075
Can you help us with our camels?

08:45.109 --> 08:45.910
There's no room.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.845
Yes, yes, yes.

08:47.878 --> 08:50.714
But we just need to rest
for a couple of hours.

08:50.748 --> 08:52.883
We have very important
things to do tomorrow.

08:52.917 --> 08:55.152
I'm sorry sirs, but we're full.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.387
Boy.

08:56.420 --> 08:58.889
It's too cold for
us to sleep outside.

08:58.923 --> 09:01.759
Kindly move your
animals, and we will...

09:02.493 --> 09:03.494
Melchior...

09:05.396 --> 09:07.464
will pay you handsomely.

09:07.498 --> 09:08.999
It's not the animals, sir.

09:10.167 --> 09:12.102
A woman had a baby here tonight.

09:16.774 --> 09:17.875
May we see this child?

09:26.517 --> 09:27.384
Could this be?

09:28.819 --> 09:30.487
We've traveled so far.

09:30.521 --> 09:35.726
I am Melchior, my friend
Balthazar and Gaspar.

09:36.527 --> 09:40.431
Am I a fool or is this
the foretold messiah?

09:40.464 --> 09:42.533
You are no fool.

09:42.566 --> 09:44.902
The birth of our son
was foretold to us

09:44.935 --> 09:46.737
by a messenger of Jehovah.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.809
Behold the King of Kings.

09:57.581 --> 09:59.016
What have you named him?

09:59.049 --> 09:59.883
Yeshua.

10:05.456 --> 10:07.391
We bring you gifts from afar.

10:08.926 --> 10:09.927
I bring you gold.

10:12.463 --> 10:16.033
A rare treasure for
such rare child.

10:17.468 --> 10:21.438
I bring you frankincense, a
gift for more than a king.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.541
A gift for a God.

10:25.943 --> 10:27.344
Behold.

10:27.378 --> 10:31.081
My gift to this
special child is myrrh.

10:31.115 --> 10:36.120
Treasured oil, holy, for the
anointing of kings and priests.

10:43.494 --> 10:44.328
Melchior!

10:44.361 --> 10:45.462
Matthias approaches!

10:55.506 --> 10:57.141
Herod lies!

10:57.174 --> 10:59.843
If we go back the way we
came, he will have you killed.

10:59.877 --> 11:00.978
You paid our homage?

11:01.011 --> 11:01.979
I did.

11:02.012 --> 11:03.180
You were most generous.

11:04.148 --> 11:07.084
But masters, Herod is insane.

11:07.117 --> 11:10.521
At one mention of the
prophecy, he flew into a rage.

11:10.554 --> 11:12.589
You are in great danger.

11:12.623 --> 11:14.258
As we feared.

11:14.291 --> 11:17.027
We have to go back home
from a different route.

11:17.061 --> 11:18.462
Quietly.

11:18.495 --> 11:21.332
Agreed, but what of the
infant Yeshua and his family?

11:21.365 --> 11:22.599
We cannot protect them.

11:22.633 --> 11:26.437
In fact, our constant
presence endangers them.

11:26.470 --> 11:28.539
We must leave tonight.

11:28.572 --> 11:31.909
We must trust that God
will protect this family.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.377
There is nothing we can do.

11:33.410 --> 11:34.611
Rise, Mathias.

11:34.645 --> 11:36.380
Go back to the camp.

11:36.413 --> 11:38.415
Order the servants to pack.

11:38.449 --> 11:39.950
We will follow you shortly.

11:39.983 --> 11:41.085
As you command, sir.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.423
What is it?

11:46.457 --> 11:48.058
It is Herod.

11:48.092 --> 11:52.329
We must return home to
the east immediately.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.598
You are in danger as well.

11:56.133 --> 11:56.934
Please...

11:59.169 --> 12:00.037
protect the child.

12:01.271 --> 12:03.407
He is the best thing to
happen to this world.

12:03.440 --> 12:04.575
I will.

12:04.608 --> 12:06.110
Thank you.

12:06.143 --> 12:09.113
One day you will
understand the significance

12:09.146 --> 12:10.381
of what's happened here.

12:10.414 --> 12:11.683
Here.

12:11.716 --> 12:13.050
Take this.

12:13.083 --> 12:15.018
Use it to care for your family.

12:15.052 --> 12:16.487
Shalom, my brother.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.521
Shalom.

12:19.523 --> 12:21.024
Good morning, Jotham.

12:23.394 --> 12:24.228
Is it morning?

12:34.605 --> 12:36.173
How did we get here?

12:37.641 --> 12:38.475
That's easy.

12:40.043 --> 12:40.944
The Romans.

12:44.615 --> 12:46.550
The question is, how
do we get out of here?

12:51.555 --> 12:53.123
We're not getting out of here.

12:56.661 --> 12:58.128
We need water.

12:58.162 --> 12:59.530
Can you show me to
the nearest well?

12:59.563 --> 13:00.564
I'll come too.

13:00.597 --> 13:03.033
No, you need to go to sleep.

13:03.066 --> 13:04.501
I want to come.

13:04.535 --> 13:05.335
Fine.

13:12.109 --> 13:13.076
I'm tired.

13:13.110 --> 13:14.311
I told you to stay and sleep.

13:14.344 --> 13:16.346
I know, but I wanted
to come with you.

13:18.081 --> 13:19.116
There it is.

13:19.149 --> 13:20.417
I'm going to walk Jotham back.

13:20.451 --> 13:23.253
All right, I will
take it from here.

13:23.287 --> 13:24.421
My foot hurts.

13:24.455 --> 13:26.490
Let me see.

13:42.339 --> 13:43.675
Do not be afraid.

13:43.708 --> 13:46.076
Messenger of Jehovah.

13:46.109 --> 13:47.578
Why do you return to me?

13:48.479 --> 13:50.380
I bring a message.

13:50.414 --> 13:53.417
Take the young child and his
mother and flee to Egypt.

13:53.450 --> 13:54.551
To Egypt?

13:55.519 --> 13:57.588
Herod is filled with fear.

13:57.621 --> 14:00.491
He knows for what purpose
the child was born.

14:00.524 --> 14:04.361
Even now he seeks out
the child to kill him.

14:04.394 --> 14:06.497
For how long must we go?

14:06.530 --> 14:08.232
Travel quietly.

14:08.265 --> 14:09.701
Tell no one.

14:09.734 --> 14:12.670
Remain there until I bring
word that it is safe.

14:12.704 --> 14:14.404
Follow the guiding of Jehovah.

14:15.239 --> 14:17.374
You will be protected.

14:17.407 --> 14:18.542
I will.

14:18.575 --> 14:19.610
I will.

14:25.750 --> 14:26.650
That wasn't for us to see.

14:26.684 --> 14:27.584
Do you understand?

14:28.820 --> 14:29.654
Let's go.

14:33.725 --> 14:35.459
The arrogance!

14:35.492 --> 14:36.393
I want them found!

14:37.394 --> 14:40.197
I want the magi brought to
me so I can kill them myself!

14:40.230 --> 14:43.233
How dare they defy me!

14:43.267 --> 14:44.501
Was I not a gracious host

14:44.535 --> 14:46.570
to allow them to
travel the kingdom?

14:46.603 --> 14:48.071
You were most
honorable, my Lord.

14:48.105 --> 14:50.708
Did I not accept
their measly tributes?

14:50.742 --> 14:51.608
Yes, you did.

14:52.509 --> 14:53.845
And I let them to
continue their journey.

14:53.878 --> 14:55.546
I endorsed them, even.

14:55.579 --> 14:58.415
And all I asked was for
them to return to me

14:58.448 --> 15:00.217
and report their findings.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.819
They betrayed you.

15:01.853 --> 15:05.222
Find them, and bring them to me.

15:05.255 --> 15:06.223
My Lord...

15:07.491 --> 15:09.426
There is something
far more dangerous

15:09.459 --> 15:12.262
than these three old men.

15:13.831 --> 15:15.465
This false prophecy.

15:17.534 --> 15:20.470
Let me go into Bethlehem
and find this child

15:20.504 --> 15:21.538
and bring him to you.

15:23.407 --> 15:28.145
We will show the people that
you are the wisest of them all.

15:29.914 --> 15:33.216
I am the wisest of men,
much wiser than the Magi.

15:36.453 --> 15:37.588
Let them go, Castor.

15:37.621 --> 15:39.489
They mean nothing to me.

15:40.825 --> 15:41.659
But...

15:43.460 --> 15:44.662
bring me back the child.

15:47.598 --> 15:48.532
Yes, my Lord.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.803
I'll send my men now.

15:51.836 --> 15:52.670
Wait!

15:53.805 --> 15:54.638
Not yet, Castor.

15:56.908 --> 16:00.912
I'm growing weary of these
people and their prophets.

16:00.945 --> 16:04.247
They do not understand the
difficulty of being their king

16:04.281 --> 16:06.183
while Rome watches
over my every move.

16:07.919 --> 16:09.586
No, if I am to break the grasp

16:09.620 --> 16:11.488
the Jews and the
Romans have over me...

16:13.190 --> 16:15.392
I must crush this
delusion once and for all.

16:20.197 --> 16:21.632
I don't understand, my Lord.

16:22.265 --> 16:24.534
Send your men to Bethlehem.

16:25.535 --> 16:28.271
And kill every male child
under the age of two.

16:29.674 --> 16:30.942
The people will
finally understand

16:30.975 --> 16:33.678
the madness of
pursing this prophecy.

16:34.912 --> 16:37.347
By my lord, if I just
bring the child to you,

16:37.381 --> 16:38.281
it'll be enough...

16:38.315 --> 16:39.583
If we kill just the one child,

16:39.616 --> 16:41.485
what will stop the
people from simply saying

16:41.518 --> 16:43.620
that the messiah was
another boy in town?

16:43.655 --> 16:44.454
No.

16:44.488 --> 16:45.890
No, I will not have it.

16:45.923 --> 16:47.892
Every single one
of them, Castor.

16:47.925 --> 16:49.526
Do not miss even one.

16:51.495 --> 16:52.529
My lord.

16:53.597 --> 16:55.432
Castor...

16:55.465 --> 16:56.668
do not fail me.

16:58.602 --> 16:59.569
Yes, my lord.

19:23.748 --> 19:24.581
No!

19:53.811 --> 19:54.611
Mother!

19:54.644 --> 19:55.680
Mother!

20:00.517 --> 20:01.585
My angel.

20:01.618 --> 20:02.954
What happened?

20:04.121 --> 20:06.389
They came for...

20:06.423 --> 20:07.058
Aram.

20:07.992 --> 20:09.593
Where's Jotham?

20:20.071 --> 20:23.107
We need to find
you help, mother!

20:23.140 --> 20:24.608
No.

20:24.641 --> 20:25.676
No.

20:26.711 --> 20:27.544
Run.

20:30.614 --> 20:33.684
Take your brother, and run.

20:36.053 --> 20:38.555
Go.

20:41.158 --> 20:41.959
Come on.

20:41.993 --> 20:43.127
We need to go.

20:57.540 --> 20:59.542
What is the meaning
of this intrusion?

20:59.576 --> 21:01.611
Have you forgotten your manners?

21:01.645 --> 21:03.714
I need to speak
with you, my lord.

21:10.154 --> 21:11.055
Leave us.

21:14.892 --> 21:15.993
Is the deed done?

21:17.527 --> 21:18.561
Yes.

21:20.164 --> 21:24.534
All the male children
in Bethlehem are dead.

21:25.269 --> 21:26.636
All of them?

21:27.738 --> 21:28.873
All of them.

21:28.906 --> 21:29.740
Good.

21:30.808 --> 21:34.111
And what of the Magi?

21:34.145 --> 21:36.747
I didn't see them in the
town, nor on the road.

21:39.283 --> 21:40.617
Treacherous fools.

21:41.385 --> 21:44.621
This business with the
Magi must be dealt with.

21:47.758 --> 21:49.492
Have your scouts found nothing?

21:50.560 --> 21:53.998
I though we were going to let
the Magi leave in disgrace.

21:54.031 --> 21:55.132
I've changed my mind.

21:55.166 --> 21:57.101
I want their heads, and I
want them brought to me now.

21:57.134 --> 21:58.468
They must be punished.

22:00.637 --> 22:03.573
Where do you think they
could have gone to, Castor?

22:03.606 --> 22:05.242
They probably fled
to the mountains.

22:05.276 --> 22:06.677
And are the king's scouts

22:06.711 --> 22:08.846
unable to enter the
king's mountains?

22:10.613 --> 22:13.516
The marauders own that land.

22:13.550 --> 22:16.120
If I sent my men in there,
they'll be at risk...

22:16.153 --> 22:17.288
You are mistaken.

22:17.321 --> 22:19.957
I own those lands and they
are my men to risk as I will.

22:21.192 --> 22:22.093
Find the Magi.

22:23.060 --> 22:27.865
My lord, their their
false messiah is dead.

22:28.833 --> 22:30.701
They hold no threat to you.

22:32.069 --> 22:34.005
Do you think me weak, Castor?

22:35.706 --> 22:36.639
No, my lord.

22:39.844 --> 22:40.978
Was I not clear?

22:42.179 --> 22:43.613
I ordered them to
report back to me

22:43.646 --> 22:45.182
when the child was found.

22:46.751 --> 22:47.650
Yes, my lord.

22:48.886 --> 22:50.721
They came to my lands...

22:52.156 --> 22:55.625
seeking a usurper to my
throne, and spat in my face.

22:57.128 --> 22:59.562
Their continued existence
is an affront to my rule.

22:59.596 --> 23:01.799
I would shed the blood
of a third of my kingdom

23:01.832 --> 23:03.667
rather than suffer
it a day longer!

23:07.204 --> 23:08.571
Find them!

23:44.842 --> 23:46.377
Dismas, my son.

23:46.410 --> 23:48.979
Look at the desert lily.

23:49.013 --> 23:50.114
See it?

23:50.147 --> 23:52.683
It grows in the harshest
places on Earth,

23:52.716 --> 23:55.820
under the hot sun, where
there are no streams,

23:55.853 --> 23:59.356
no rivers, no hope
for living things.

23:59.390 --> 24:04.361
Where other plants wither,
Jehovah provides a way,

24:05.296 --> 24:09.867
and so it survives,
and in time, it blooms.

24:16.040 --> 24:18.275
Of all the ways to go...

24:20.277 --> 24:23.380
I would never have known you
two would be the end of me.

24:23.414 --> 24:25.648
You should have
left us alone, Abba.

24:25.683 --> 24:28.285
You shouldn't have
put up a fight.

24:28.319 --> 24:30.187
Tiran was right no
to to trust you.

24:31.188 --> 24:35.659
I thought maybe you'd
gain some wisdom with age,

24:35.693 --> 24:37.928
but you're just as
bad as when I met you.

24:39.763 --> 24:43.367
No, I am worse than
when you met me.

24:48.139 --> 24:48.973
Stand.

24:51.909 --> 24:53.444
Who are you?

24:53.477 --> 24:55.212
I'm Dismas.

24:55.246 --> 24:56.714
Dismas.

24:56.747 --> 24:59.083
And how did Dismas
come to be out here

24:59.116 --> 25:00.384
in the middle of nowhere?

25:02.219 --> 25:04.255
Are you aware that
you're trespassing, boy?

25:04.288 --> 25:05.189
How?

25:05.222 --> 25:06.957
This is the middle of nowhere.

25:06.991 --> 25:08.993
The middle of nowhere.

25:15.166 --> 25:16.000
I'm Tiran.

25:17.301 --> 25:18.169
These are my men.

25:19.036 --> 25:20.137
This is my desert.

25:21.005 --> 25:23.240
Are you traders?

25:23.274 --> 25:24.341
We're distributors.

25:25.342 --> 25:28.479
We re-distribute wealth
among fellow travelers.

25:28.512 --> 25:30.447
Oh.

25:30.481 --> 25:32.283
You understand what that means?

25:33.217 --> 25:34.385
It means...

25:35.286 --> 25:36.754
you're thieves!

25:37.521 --> 25:39.456
Look at every one
of their faces, boy.

25:40.758 --> 25:41.725
These men here

25:42.661 --> 25:44.395
are from every far flung
corner of the world,

25:44.428 --> 25:47.765
including my boy, Gestas, who
grew up in the Mediterranean.

25:48.532 --> 25:50.000
Their left their
past lives behind

25:50.034 --> 25:51.335
to make a better one here.

25:52.403 --> 25:53.771
You seem like a smart boy

25:53.804 --> 25:55.739
despite getting
lost in the desert.

25:55.773 --> 25:57.975
So surely you realize
who the true thieves are?

25:58.008 --> 26:01.011
The rich, who make a fortunes
off the back of slaves,

26:01.045 --> 26:04.882
the tax collectors who
pad their books with gold.

26:06.850 --> 26:07.851
Gold like this.

26:10.387 --> 26:15.226
Where does a desert rat like
you get a coin like this?

26:17.995 --> 26:18.829
I found it.

26:20.297 --> 26:21.131
You're a liar.

26:22.299 --> 26:24.835
Oh, I hate doing this.

26:24.868 --> 26:26.403
Abba, the little one!

26:26.437 --> 26:27.438
Stop!

26:27.471 --> 26:28.372
Don't hurt him!

26:28.405 --> 26:29.840
I'll tell you how I got it!

26:29.873 --> 26:31.008
That's adorable.

26:31.041 --> 26:32.476
But if the next words
out of his mouth

26:32.509 --> 26:34.378
aren't exactly where
he got that coin,

26:34.411 --> 26:36.780
slit his delicate throat.

26:36.814 --> 26:38.249
Speak, rat.

26:38.282 --> 26:39.383
I stole it!

26:39.416 --> 26:41.785
We almost got caught, and
that's why we're out here.

26:41.819 --> 26:44.255
Now, please, let my brother go!

26:46.457 --> 26:48.492
It takes on thief to
know another, huh?

26:50.861 --> 26:54.265
You lifted a coin like this
without getting caught?

26:54.298 --> 26:56.433
Can no one else be
thieves but you?

26:58.302 --> 27:00.471
I'd like to meet the man
that owned this coin.

27:00.504 --> 27:03.140
I'd imagine there's a lot
more where this came from.

27:03.173 --> 27:04.475
Wouldn't you?

27:04.508 --> 27:06.277
Maybe.

27:06.310 --> 27:07.311
Maybe?

27:07.344 --> 27:08.379
How about this, boy?

27:09.280 --> 27:10.481
You take me to this man,

27:11.215 --> 27:13.817
and I won't cut your
hands off for thieving?

27:16.086 --> 27:16.920
Rat.

27:30.934 --> 27:33.370
The Magi had lots of guards.

27:33.404 --> 27:34.538
They'll protect us.

27:34.571 --> 27:37.374
These raiders don't
stand a chance.

27:37.408 --> 27:38.609
Are you sure?

27:38.642 --> 27:39.543
Yes.

27:39.576 --> 27:40.978
Well...

27:41.011 --> 27:41.845
pretty sure.

27:43.013 --> 27:44.348
I'm scared.

27:44.381 --> 27:46.250
I know, I am too.

27:47.418 --> 27:48.385
You are?

27:48.419 --> 27:50.854
Yes, but we have to be brave.

27:50.888 --> 27:52.189
Can you be brave with me?

27:53.524 --> 27:54.525
Yes.

27:54.558 --> 27:56.527
I can if you can.

27:56.560 --> 27:57.461
Good.

27:57.494 --> 27:58.529
Then do everything I say.

27:59.664 --> 28:00.564
It's Thomas.

28:03.400 --> 28:04.601
Thomas.

28:04.635 --> 28:06.470
Come on, Gestas.

28:06.503 --> 28:08.238
Give me good news, Thomas.

28:08.272 --> 28:10.441
There's a large
caravan, all right.

28:10.474 --> 28:12.609
Little rat is telling the truth.

28:12.643 --> 28:14.578
They have dozens of soldiers.

28:14.611 --> 28:17.247
They work in shifts
into the night.

28:17.281 --> 28:19.983
Either they're scared, or
they have a lot to protect.

28:23.020 --> 28:24.488
Follow them 'til they
make camp for the night,

28:24.521 --> 28:25.522
then circle back.

28:26.523 --> 28:28.058
We'll attack them by surprise.

28:28.092 --> 28:28.892
Yes, sir.

28:28.926 --> 28:30.494
Take Gestas with you.

28:30.527 --> 28:31.663
It's time this little
scoundrel learned

28:31.696 --> 28:33.464
how to scout a camp properly.

28:41.271 --> 28:43.207
I'll keep him safe.

28:43.240 --> 28:44.074
Safe?

28:45.476 --> 28:47.411
How's he supposed to learn
anything if he's safe?

29:39.029 --> 29:39.664
Where is it?

29:41.265 --> 29:42.065
That is it.

29:42.099 --> 29:43.467
That is all we have.

29:43.500 --> 29:45.102
That's all you have?

29:45.135 --> 29:47.504
Is that why you have
a tent fit for a queen

29:47.538 --> 29:51.108
and an entire pack of guards
looking after your back?

29:51.141 --> 29:54.111
We are just simple travelers
traveling through this...

29:55.279 --> 29:57.448
I know exactly who you are
and where you've traveled.

29:57.481 --> 29:59.550
Your friends here
already shared that.

29:59.583 --> 30:02.119
Now, I'm going to ask
you one more time, Magi.

30:02.152 --> 30:03.420
Where's the rest of it?

30:03.454 --> 30:05.289
You are correct.

30:05.322 --> 30:07.991
We are Magi.

30:08.025 --> 30:10.127
But there's no more riches.

30:14.498 --> 30:15.499
Stop!

30:15.532 --> 30:16.400
Please.

30:16.433 --> 30:18.335
I'll tell you everything
you want to hear.

30:18.368 --> 30:20.504
Finally there's
a smart man here!

30:20.537 --> 30:22.406
Please, enlighten me.

30:22.439 --> 30:25.609
When we crossed the border
into Herod's territory,

30:25.642 --> 30:30.414
his men came to us and demanded
that we pay Herod's toll.

30:30.447 --> 30:33.751
His man Castor
threatened to execute us.

30:33.785 --> 30:34.618
Castor.

30:35.753 --> 30:38.255
That wonderful occupier.

30:38.288 --> 30:40.224
To whom we are the resistance.

30:40.257 --> 30:42.493
I've crossed paths
with Castor before.

30:42.526 --> 30:43.427
Yes.

30:43.460 --> 30:47.331
So, we paid quite a
large amount as tribute,

30:47.364 --> 30:50.200
hoping that this would all
be over, but it wasn't.

30:50.234 --> 30:53.337
Castor's men came back and
robbed us of the rest of it.

30:53.370 --> 30:55.239
We made haste to the east,

30:55.272 --> 30:57.474
trying to escape from
being robbed anymore.

30:58.542 --> 31:02.012
But the, well, um, you...

31:03.113 --> 31:04.214
robbed us.

31:04.248 --> 31:05.516
I haven't robbed you yet,
because you won't tell me

31:05.549 --> 31:07.284
where the rest of it is.

31:07.317 --> 31:08.218
Dismas!

31:08.252 --> 31:09.052
Come here.

31:10.755 --> 31:12.322
Do you know these men?

31:12.356 --> 31:14.291
I cared for their
livestock a few days ago.

31:14.324 --> 31:16.460
Is this the rat you
caught stealing?

31:16.493 --> 31:19.062
I beg your pardon,
almost caught.

31:20.798 --> 31:21.699
Of course.

31:21.733 --> 31:23.600
We thought he had escaped.

31:23.634 --> 31:26.603
I don't suppose you would let
us keep him and his brother

31:26.637 --> 31:28.071
so that they may be punished?

31:28.105 --> 31:29.339
No.

31:29.373 --> 31:30.742
I'm growing quite fond
of the little vermin.

31:30.775 --> 31:32.609
In fact, I think
we'll keep them.

31:32.643 --> 31:34.545
As for you three...

31:37.481 --> 31:40.617
Drop your weapons now,
or I kill the boy.

31:42.352 --> 31:46.089
This must be the incredibly
simple Magi.

31:46.123 --> 31:47.324
You want to do it?

31:47.357 --> 31:48.292
Kill him.

31:48.325 --> 31:49.626
Mathias, let the boy go!

31:51.562 --> 31:52.730
I will do it!

31:52.764 --> 31:55.265
I will slit his throat!

31:55.299 --> 31:56.868
Release my masters now!

31:56.901 --> 31:57.702
Let him go!

31:57.735 --> 31:58.535
Don't harm him!

31:58.569 --> 32:00.137
Stand down, Abba.

32:00.170 --> 32:00.805
Let him kill him.

32:00.838 --> 32:02.740
Let my brother go!

32:07.544 --> 32:10.147
You are pathetic, sir.

32:11.582 --> 32:13.517
I believe you were just
disarmed by a little boy.

32:15.452 --> 32:17.588
Stupid and incompetent.

32:17.621 --> 32:19.757
Two very unfortunate qualities.

32:21.391 --> 32:23.728
This is who you pick to be
the captain of your guard?

32:24.929 --> 32:26.798
I thought Magi were
supposed to be wise.

32:29.366 --> 32:30.534
Dismas.

32:30.567 --> 32:31.568
Come here.

32:33.470 --> 32:35.172
You see that man over there?

32:35.205 --> 32:36.774
The one we're holding?

32:36.808 --> 32:38.642
He was going to kill you.

32:38.676 --> 32:41.211
He was going to
slit your throat.

32:41.244 --> 32:43.447
And now you're
going to kill him.

32:43.480 --> 32:44.514
Take this sword.

32:46.550 --> 32:47.351
I can't.

32:47.384 --> 32:48.452
Yes you can!

32:48.485 --> 32:50.354
Thomas will hold him for you.

32:50.387 --> 32:51.321
I won't!

32:51.355 --> 32:52.589
Yes you will!

32:52.623 --> 32:53.624
Or Abba will take
your brother's life!

32:53.658 --> 32:54.491
No!

32:54.524 --> 32:55.525
Stop!

32:55.559 --> 32:56.526
You stop.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.795
You stop.

32:57.829 --> 32:59.363
You're the only
who can stop this.

32:59.396 --> 33:01.398
You're the one who
determines what happens here.

33:01.431 --> 33:03.333
He was about to
slit your throat.

33:03.367 --> 33:04.201
Do yo understand?

33:05.469 --> 33:06.738
Do it.

33:06.771 --> 33:08.205
Are you a coward?
No.

33:08.238 --> 33:09.272
Then what are you waiting for?

33:09.306 --> 33:10.173
Do it!

33:10.207 --> 33:13.410
Now!

33:24.956 --> 33:27.491
Ladies, here are your spoils.

33:27.524 --> 33:28.525
Share them accordingly.

33:29.927 --> 33:31.461
Who's the one responsible
for tying the poor man

33:31.495 --> 33:33.430
that got himself
killed last night?

33:34.699 --> 33:36.701
I am, sir.

33:36.734 --> 33:37.567
Thomas.

33:40.637 --> 33:42.372
Oh, no.

33:42.406 --> 33:44.809
You need to learn to tie
better knots, old man.

33:46.510 --> 33:48.378
You almost got Dismas
killed on his first raid.

33:48.412 --> 33:49.747
Apologies, sir.

33:51.381 --> 33:52.684
Although, the little rat
did gain much experience.

33:52.717 --> 33:54.284
Isn't that right, Dismas?

33:56.654 --> 33:57.587
I didn't think you'd do it.

33:57.621 --> 33:58.656
Did you think he would, Abba?

33:58.690 --> 33:59.489
No, sir.

34:03.493 --> 34:07.264
I think the time has come
for you and your brother...

34:07.297 --> 34:09.399
to become permanent
members of our family.

34:10.668 --> 34:11.601
Is that understood?

34:12.502 --> 34:13.570
Yes.
Good.

34:14.538 --> 34:15.605
Then it's settled.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.441
But we do have one problem

34:17.474 --> 34:18.910
that we do need
to address first.

34:20.310 --> 34:22.680
Your error almost got us killed.

34:22.714 --> 34:24.614
For practically
nothing in return.

34:27.551 --> 34:28.753
You need to be punished.

34:30.587 --> 34:31.421
Gestas.

34:32.556 --> 34:33.958
Make me proud, son.

34:34.926 --> 34:35.760
Let me go!

34:48.039 --> 34:50.273
Jotham.

34:50.307 --> 34:51.374
You didn't have to.

34:52.609 --> 34:53.878
Don't ignore me.

34:53.911 --> 34:55.378
You know what I'm talking about.

34:55.412 --> 34:56.546
You gave me the sword!

34:59.016 --> 35:00.517
What was I supposed to do?

35:01.585 --> 35:04.621
We have always kept each other
alive, through everything!

35:05.288 --> 35:07.591
You have always kept me alive.

35:09.526 --> 35:11.561
And how do I save
you now brother?

35:15.800 --> 35:17.434
Looking good, brother.

35:21.806 --> 35:22.774
Good.

35:22.807 --> 35:24.508
Watch your footwork, Jotham.

35:30.480 --> 35:31.682
Sorry, brother.

35:32.582 --> 35:35.418
Keep your guard up, Dismas.

35:35.452 --> 35:36.654
The fight's never over.

35:38.455 --> 35:39.589
Come on, let's eat.

36:03.446 --> 36:04.782
Stop, thief!

36:04.816 --> 36:06.583
Guards!

37:00.604 --> 37:01.706
Longinus.

37:01.739 --> 37:04.507
It is fortunate to see
you've returned in one piece.

37:04.541 --> 37:05.343
Thank you Legatus.

37:05.375 --> 37:07.144
And I take it you
were successful?

37:07.178 --> 37:08.846
These barbarians have a penchant

37:08.880 --> 37:11.648
for dismembering those
who insult their pride.

37:11.682 --> 37:13.150
Yes sir.

37:13.184 --> 37:15.619
The Atrebates will resume
paying tribute at once.

37:17.154 --> 37:18.521
What's this one here for?

37:22.894 --> 37:23.895
Insurance.

37:25.629 --> 37:26.664
Very well.

37:27.464 --> 37:29.734
I have a new task
for you, Longinus.

37:29.767 --> 37:32.904
Our Judean friends are having
problems with brigands.

37:32.937 --> 37:34.437
Judea?

37:34.471 --> 37:35.072
The province is a festering...

37:35.106 --> 37:36.640
You forget yourself!

37:37.708 --> 37:39.944
Rome calls upon you to serve.

37:41.112 --> 37:43.981
Are you a servant of Rome?

37:45.249 --> 37:46.083
Yes, sir.

37:48.551 --> 37:49.186
Forgive me.

37:50.855 --> 37:52.189
For years these
bands of marauders

37:52.223 --> 37:54.491
have terrorized the populace.

37:54.524 --> 37:55.558
They're questioning
Rome's ability

37:55.592 --> 37:57.828
to keep her citizens safe.

37:57.862 --> 38:01.032
I selected you for this task
because of how you put down

38:01.065 --> 38:03.600
the insurrection among
these Celtic tribes!

38:03.633 --> 38:05.036
You will go to Judea,

38:05.069 --> 38:08.638
eradicate these savages
and restore order!

38:11.608 --> 38:12.642
Is that clear?

38:14.611 --> 38:16.013
It will be done.

38:19.850 --> 38:22.519
What news of the
caravan you're scouting?

38:22.552 --> 38:23.421
They look like merchants.

38:23.453 --> 38:26.589
Heavy laden wagons
with only a few men.

38:26.623 --> 38:27.658
How many men?

38:27.692 --> 38:28.625
Nine or 10.

38:28.659 --> 38:30.593
Well is it nine or is it 10?

38:31.262 --> 38:32.663
Relax, Dismas.

38:32.697 --> 38:34.699
You're like an old
woman these days.

38:35.833 --> 38:37.600
Relax, brother.

38:37.634 --> 38:39.569
There's only
merchants, no guards.

38:41.538 --> 38:43.540
Gestas is right, you do
worry like an old woman.

38:43.573 --> 38:45.575
Yeah, an old woman who
can take either of you

38:45.608 --> 38:47.510
in a sword fight any day.

38:47.544 --> 38:48.446
So don't forget it?

38:48.478 --> 38:50.848
Gestas, do you think
it's worth the risk?

38:51.983 --> 38:52.817
I do.

38:53.918 --> 38:55.152
Then we ride at dark.

38:57.054 --> 38:57.955
Gestas...

38:59.622 --> 39:01.158
you're in command of this one.

39:02.927 --> 39:04.028
Thank you, father.

39:04.061 --> 39:04.895
Come.

39:06.097 --> 39:07.630
Tell me of your strategy.

39:16.639 --> 39:18.009
How's the edge on that thing?

39:19.343 --> 39:20.577
Give it here.

39:26.183 --> 39:27.918
What are you so angry about?

39:27.952 --> 39:29.020
I'm not angry.

39:30.287 --> 39:31.288
Dismas...

39:32.857 --> 39:33.691
Dismas...

39:35.326 --> 39:36.994
All the men in this camp,
they treat me like a man.

39:37.028 --> 39:38.696
Why can't you?

39:38.729 --> 39:40.998
Look, I know this
isn't an easy life,

39:41.032 --> 39:43.234
but it provides for us.

39:43.267 --> 39:45.535
I promised mother I
would protect you.

39:46.504 --> 39:49.340
You make a wrong move,
one mistake,

39:49.373 --> 39:50.640
it could get you killed.

39:51.876 --> 39:53.778
So no mistakes.

39:53.811 --> 39:54.879
No mistakes then.

39:56.613 --> 39:58.315
No mistakes.

41:18.796 --> 41:19.629
Come, brother.

42:03.073 --> 42:06.243
I don't think he's
going to make it.

42:20.991 --> 42:21.825
Move.

43:06.103 --> 43:06.904
Whoa!

43:06.937 --> 43:08.105
Lie down, brother.

43:11.442 --> 43:12.476
What happened?

43:13.811 --> 43:15.813
Centurion put his
spear through you.

43:17.114 --> 43:18.415
Tore a pretty good sized hole.

43:20.584 --> 43:22.419
You've been here three days.

43:23.454 --> 43:24.922
You should be dead.

43:25.556 --> 43:26.824
Where are we?

43:26.857 --> 43:27.524
Jerusalem.

43:28.892 --> 43:30.761
Father has a woman
here who took us in.

43:34.098 --> 43:35.432
You said three days?

43:36.967 --> 43:39.003
You were out for
four, with a fever.

43:39.970 --> 43:40.838
Been here three.

43:42.306 --> 43:43.974
The healer said that
you wouldn't make it,

43:44.008 --> 43:46.210
but I told her you
were too tough.

43:46.243 --> 43:47.077
Now look at you.

43:48.879 --> 43:50.180
Aren't I the lucky one?

43:56.420 --> 43:58.122
What about the rest of the men?

43:59.590 --> 44:00.424
At the cave.

44:01.925 --> 44:03.427
The ones who made
it out at least.

44:04.461 --> 44:06.030
What is it, Gestas?

44:06.063 --> 44:06.897
Tell me.

44:10.501 --> 44:11.302
Come.

44:12.202 --> 44:13.003
Thank you.

44:14.338 --> 44:15.239
For coming back.

44:16.373 --> 44:19.410
I know you did it for your
brother, but you saved me too.

44:20.878 --> 44:23.047
You would have done it for me.

44:23.080 --> 44:24.281
No.

44:24.315 --> 44:25.349
I wouldn't have.

44:28.552 --> 44:30.521
I've hated you from
the day we met.

44:34.659 --> 44:36.060
You earned respect.

44:37.528 --> 44:40.064
To speak truly, that only
made me despise you more.

44:41.365 --> 44:42.466
Jealous, I suppose.

44:46.437 --> 44:49.139
I've shown you nothing but
cruelty over the years.

44:50.207 --> 44:53.844
We all have had
difficult childhoods.

44:56.447 --> 45:00.551
I've always hoped that
we could become friends.

45:00.584 --> 45:01.485
You are my brother.

45:04.421 --> 45:05.489
No more distrust.

45:07.091 --> 45:08.592
No more anger. No more cruelty.

45:11.395 --> 45:16.066
From this day on, I will look
out for you and Jotham...

45:18.102 --> 45:21.638
as if you were my own brothers,
my own flesh and blood.

45:23.040 --> 45:23.941
I swear it.

45:26.176 --> 45:27.611
I trust your words.

45:31.482 --> 45:32.516
Get some rest.

46:00.244 --> 46:01.211
Watch your step there.

46:01.245 --> 46:02.613
These streets are terrible.

46:04.114 --> 46:05.416
I hate this city.

46:05.449 --> 46:07.184
Yeah.

46:07.217 --> 46:09.086
You hate all cities.

46:09.119 --> 46:10.521
Too noisy.

46:10.554 --> 46:12.289
I grew up sleeping
in the desert.

46:12.322 --> 46:13.457
I'm used to quiet.

46:14.391 --> 46:17.127
Aside from the regular
nighttime raids.

46:19.363 --> 46:20.597
I want some fruit.

46:20.631 --> 46:21.465
You want some fruit?

46:21.498 --> 46:22.700
Figs?

46:22.734 --> 46:23.567
Sure.

46:25.469 --> 46:27.504
I think I over did it, boys.

46:28.505 --> 46:29.973
I'm gonna sit for a while.

46:31.341 --> 46:32.342
Are you okay?

46:33.210 --> 46:34.679
I'm fine.

46:34.712 --> 46:36.980
Go, go to the marketplace.

46:38.148 --> 46:39.550
I just need some rest.

46:39.583 --> 46:40.417
You sure?

46:40.451 --> 46:41.452
Yes, go.

46:41.485 --> 46:42.319
I'll be fine.

46:46.490 --> 46:47.524
Go.

46:49.526 --> 46:50.627
I'll bring you back a fig.

46:50.662 --> 46:51.495
Okay.

47:42.613 --> 47:46.216
Our journeys began
in this place.

47:46.250 --> 47:47.084
Yeshua?

47:49.453 --> 47:50.254
I am.

47:56.393 --> 47:57.494
Why am I here?

47:58.529 --> 48:02.734
You are here because you seek
the past and not the future.

48:04.568 --> 48:08.605
What you thirst for is not here.

48:10.240 --> 48:12.810
I have not been back here
since my mother was killed.

48:15.312 --> 48:17.047
That night, a part
of me died too.

48:19.717 --> 48:22.820
She was the only person
who ever truly loved me.

48:24.856 --> 48:29.794
If she saw me now,
she would be ashamed.

48:31.696 --> 48:33.230
She would never forgive me.

48:35.499 --> 48:38.302
No one is beyond forgiveness.

48:40.604 --> 48:45.108
You are bound by chains, and
know not that you have the key.

48:48.378 --> 48:50.247
Seek forgiveness
from the Father,

48:52.784 --> 48:54.484
and He will set you free.

48:55.519 --> 48:56.854
I deserve my fate.

48:58.622 --> 49:02.326
I just hope it's not too late
for my brother, and me too.

49:07.665 --> 49:09.299
I heard you are a healer.

49:12.269 --> 49:13.604
Can you help me?

49:14.504 --> 49:15.840
Can you make me well again?

49:20.477 --> 49:21.545
Rise, Dismas.

49:23.647 --> 49:25.582
Your journey is far from over.

49:32.857 --> 49:33.691
Dismas?

49:36.259 --> 49:39.529
I want every man here...

49:39.563 --> 49:41.231
to know...

49:41.264 --> 49:42.734
that I am indebted to you...

49:44.936 --> 49:46.771
for saving my son.

49:46.804 --> 49:48.271
To Dismas!

49:48.305 --> 49:49.707
Dismas!

49:49.741 --> 49:53.310
Now, to speak truthfully,
I'm growing old,

49:53.343 --> 49:55.445
and the time has come
for me to find a wife

49:55.479 --> 49:56.613
and a few mistresses.

49:59.817 --> 50:01.518
And settle down.

50:01.551 --> 50:04.588
Enjoy the spoils of life.

50:05.489 --> 50:06.556
But before that day comes,

50:06.590 --> 50:08.625
because that day
has not arrived yet,

50:10.460 --> 50:11.495
Dismas...

50:12.596 --> 50:14.398
Is the one whose
lead you will follow.

50:15.532 --> 50:16.834
From this day forward...

50:18.936 --> 50:22.674
you are to follow his commands
as if they were my own.

50:24.541 --> 50:27.277
To legacies and legends!

50:34.651 --> 50:35.753
Don't worry about Gestas.

50:36.688 --> 50:37.689
He's sulking.

50:37.722 --> 50:39.289
He'll be fine.

50:39.322 --> 50:40.892
It's not Gestas
that concerns me.

50:44.929 --> 50:47.364
Shouldn't Abba be the
one to lead the men?

50:47.397 --> 50:48.733
Abba?

50:48.766 --> 50:50.467
Have you gone mad?

50:50.500 --> 50:51.401
How long do you think
these men would last

50:51.435 --> 50:54.471
with that bloodthirsty
oaf as their chief?

50:54.504 --> 50:55.840
They'd all be killed
in a glorious battle

50:55.873 --> 50:58.508
with the Romans
before the year's end.

50:58.542 --> 50:59.543
Dismas...

51:01.278 --> 51:02.512
you are the right choice.

51:03.647 --> 51:04.916
Every man here knows it.

51:09.020 --> 51:09.854
And now...

51:10.722 --> 51:12.690
for a proper celebration.

51:12.724 --> 51:17.662
Word has reached my ear
about our old friend, Thomas.

51:20.497 --> 51:23.633
That's right, you
remember the traitor.

51:23.668 --> 51:25.469
I won't even call him a man.

51:25.502 --> 51:28.405
He abandoned us,
he stole from us,

51:29.606 --> 51:32.542
He hid in the hills
like a coward.

51:33.510 --> 51:35.713
He has now forgotten who he is.

51:36.546 --> 51:38.615
But we do not forget.

51:40.051 --> 51:41.018
We know who we are.

51:42.385 --> 51:44.021
We're going to take
back what is ours.

51:56.333 --> 51:56.901
Gestas.

51:59.603 --> 52:01.505
Thought I might
find you out here.

52:06.576 --> 52:07.812
How could he do that to me?

52:09.513 --> 52:10.514
I'm his son.

52:11.749 --> 52:14.018
I've done everything
he's ever asked of me.

52:15.652 --> 52:17.789
I've earned the right to
take over when he's gone.

52:18.990 --> 52:21.424
You know Dismas couldn't
have known, right?

52:23.560 --> 52:25.696
He probably doesn't
even want...

52:29.033 --> 52:31.368
Dismas would never
do that to you.

52:32.970 --> 52:34.972
I'm not mad at Dismas.

52:35.673 --> 52:39.076
It's my father who's the fool.

52:39.110 --> 52:40.244
He didn't have to
choose right now,

52:40.278 --> 52:43.446
he could have waited, given
me a chance to prove myself.

52:46.616 --> 52:47.952
I should kill him while he
sleeps and take what's mine.

52:47.985 --> 52:49.787
Gestas, you cannot
talk like this.

52:52.657 --> 52:55.660
Tiran needed to choose
someone with a level head.

52:57.561 --> 52:59.462
You know that.

53:10.473 --> 53:11.575
Gestas...

53:11.608 --> 53:12.642
I didn't know.

53:13.510 --> 53:14.544
Of course not.

53:16.714 --> 53:18.615
You forget my father
was ashamed of me

53:18.648 --> 53:20.417
long before my
brothers came along.

53:22.820 --> 53:24.621
You've done nothing wrong by me.

53:26.691 --> 53:29.426
My problem is with my
father, not my brothers.

53:32.596 --> 53:33.764
I'm glad you understand.

53:40.805 --> 53:43.708
I am going to drink
myself to sleep now.

53:43.741 --> 53:44.709
Good night.

53:44.742 --> 53:45.575
Be well.

53:49.947 --> 53:51.883
Brother, I need to talk to you.

53:51.916 --> 53:52.783
What is it?

53:52.817 --> 53:54.484
Is it about Gestas?

53:54.517 --> 53:56.821
You're gonna think I've
gone mad, but hear me out.

53:57.722 --> 53:58.521
Promise me.

54:00.024 --> 54:00.858
Okay, I promise.

54:00.892 --> 54:02.492
You saw my wound.

54:02.525 --> 54:04.594
You saw how bad it was, right?

54:06.130 --> 54:07.631
I saw it, what of it?

54:07.665 --> 54:09.901
You remember the night
mother was killed?

54:12.569 --> 54:16.573
The baby that was
born in the stable?

54:16.606 --> 54:17.607
Yeshua...

54:19.710 --> 54:20.945
I remember.

54:20.978 --> 54:24.982
In Nazareth, when
you and Gestas...

54:25.016 --> 54:28.551
went to the marketplace,
I was by the gate.

54:29.854 --> 54:30.755
I fell asleep.

54:32.023 --> 54:33.758
I had a dream, a vision.

54:35.793 --> 54:36.626
He came to me.

54:37.728 --> 54:38.561
We spoke.

54:41.032 --> 54:43.968
He said that no one
was beyond forgiveness

54:44.001 --> 54:48.139
and that I must ask the
Father to forgive me.

54:49.807 --> 54:52.575
We spoke about him
being a healer.

54:53.643 --> 54:54.644
I asked could he heal me.

54:56.613 --> 54:58.683
I asked him to
make me well again.

54:58.716 --> 55:01.551
It sounds like he cast
some sort of spell on you.

55:01.584 --> 55:02.619
No spell.

55:03.421 --> 55:07.590
It was him, and he came
to me, and he healed me.

55:10.560 --> 55:11.929
Dismas, that is not possible.

55:12.930 --> 55:14.966
Remember what the Magi said?

55:14.999 --> 55:20.004
He said that the baby's
birth fulfilled a prophesy.

55:23.240 --> 55:26.177
I remember.

55:26.210 --> 55:29.512
I remember that that prophesy

55:29.546 --> 55:31.849
is the reason why the
soldiers came to Bethlehem,

55:32.984 --> 55:35.219
why they killed mother and Aram.

55:35.252 --> 55:36.053
I remember it, brother.

55:36.087 --> 55:36.988
How could I forget?

55:38.089 --> 55:41.158
Jotham, what if they were right?

55:41.192 --> 55:43.227
They were superstitious old men!

55:45.628 --> 55:48.598
Dismas, what kind of
savior brings death

55:48.631 --> 55:50.134
to everyone around him?

55:50.167 --> 55:52.703
Well, surely you remember
the day at the well.

55:53.603 --> 55:54.839
You saw it.

55:54.872 --> 55:55.840
You felt it, too.

55:55.873 --> 55:57.241
I don't know what I saw!

55:58.976 --> 56:01.611
It could have been a
dream for all we know.

56:01.644 --> 56:03.147
There's no way you believe that.

56:04.048 --> 56:06.951
And who are you to
tell me what I believe?

56:06.984 --> 56:08.719
I'm your brother.

56:08.753 --> 56:09.619
That's who I am!

56:09.652 --> 56:10.821
Get back here!

56:46.257 --> 56:47.058
Thomas.

56:49.026 --> 56:49.860
Tiran.

56:51.395 --> 56:52.930
You plan on using that?

56:55.666 --> 56:57.068
That's up to you, old friend.

56:58.235 --> 57:00.071
You shouldn't have
stolen what's ours.

57:01.272 --> 57:03.140
I only took what
was rightfully mine.

57:03.174 --> 57:05.608
Use that sword, they die.

57:06.609 --> 57:09.346
Give it to me, settle your
debt, and we'll be on our way.

57:12.416 --> 57:13.650
What, Thomas?

57:16.754 --> 57:17.922
You'll let them live?

57:41.445 --> 57:42.379
Kill the family.

57:42.413 --> 57:43.646
No!

57:47.351 --> 57:48.152
Run!

57:48.185 --> 57:48.986
Run!

57:49.019 --> 57:49.854
Run, run!

58:00.364 --> 58:01.832
Run, run!

58:15.279 --> 58:17.214
See you on the other side.

58:18.816 --> 58:19.649
Dismas!

58:21.051 --> 58:22.419
Why'd you let the boy go?

58:29.026 --> 58:30.294
This has gone too far.

58:31.295 --> 58:35.099
We must go, before we get
dragged any deeper into this.

58:37.101 --> 58:38.702
Tiran has been good to us.

58:40.237 --> 58:41.372
Tiran is mad.

58:43.440 --> 58:44.275
No.

58:45.743 --> 58:47.845
We ride hard to Jerusalem.

58:50.514 --> 58:51.749
Tonight.

58:53.150 --> 58:54.351
When the men are asleep.

58:56.086 --> 58:58.122
Take the money we have stashed.

58:58.155 --> 59:02.393
Buy fresh horses
and keep on riding.

59:03.194 --> 59:06.063
Dismas, one mistake
and we're dead.

59:06.096 --> 59:06.931
No mistakes.

59:11.402 --> 59:13.304
All we need is food and water

59:13.971 --> 59:15.839
to last us until tomorrow night.

59:18.209 --> 59:19.476
We don't need anything else.

59:20.945 --> 59:21.779
I'm afraid.

59:24.548 --> 59:25.382
So am I.

59:27.851 --> 59:29.753
But we use the
fear to stay sharp.

59:33.457 --> 59:34.291
Brother.

59:35.226 --> 59:37.361
Get as much rest as you can.

59:37.394 --> 59:40.231
It's a long ride to the city.

1:00:33.917 --> 1:00:36.520
Where are you off to?

1:00:38.622 --> 1:00:40.557
I was going to go investigate
the noise that I...

1:00:43.527 --> 1:00:45.062
You're a liar, Jotham.

1:00:46.497 --> 1:00:48.899
See, Gestas told
me of your plan.

1:00:52.536 --> 1:00:53.337
Gestas?

1:00:54.471 --> 1:00:55.506
You did this?

1:00:56.974 --> 1:00:58.842
You were two rats
in a desert alone.

1:01:00.177 --> 1:01:01.345
I gave you both a home.

1:01:02.613 --> 1:01:03.881
I raised you.

1:01:05.115 --> 1:01:06.450
Trusted you.

1:01:06.483 --> 1:01:08.185
Forgive us, Tiran.

1:01:08.218 --> 1:01:10.220
Father, please don't kill them.

1:01:10.254 --> 1:01:11.488
They deserve punishment,
but not death.

1:01:12.990 --> 1:01:14.425
The punishment for
treason is death!

1:01:16.327 --> 1:01:17.161
On your feet.

1:01:18.962 --> 1:01:21.165
These two men no
longer want to be here.

1:01:21.198 --> 1:01:23.400
Now, we're going to
help make that possible.

1:01:23.434 --> 1:01:24.435
Tiran, no.

1:01:25.569 --> 1:01:27.137
You can't do this!

1:01:27.171 --> 1:01:28.305
Dismas?

1:01:28.339 --> 1:01:31.575
Tonight, one of you will
live, and one of you will die.

1:01:31.608 --> 1:01:33.377
You will fight each
other to the death,

1:01:33.410 --> 1:01:34.978
and the survivor is free.

1:01:37.281 --> 1:01:38.382
No.

1:01:38.415 --> 1:01:39.883
I won't kill my brother!

1:01:41.452 --> 1:01:43.087
We've done you no injury.

1:01:44.321 --> 1:01:45.956
We only wanted to leave.

1:01:47.157 --> 1:01:48.092
Please.

1:01:48.125 --> 1:01:50.160
Please, don't make us do this.

1:01:50.194 --> 1:01:53.397
Father, cast them both out,
a harsh but just punishment.

1:01:53.430 --> 1:01:54.331
I beg you.

1:01:54.365 --> 1:01:58.302
You do not to get to
beg for their lives.

1:01:58.335 --> 1:01:59.603
That's not how this works.

1:02:00.471 --> 1:02:04.041
You need to slither
back to your bedroll.

1:02:04.074 --> 1:02:06.443
You don't have the stomach
for what comes next.

1:02:08.979 --> 1:02:09.613
Be gone.

1:02:12.416 --> 1:02:14.118
Jotham, I can't do this.

1:02:15.586 --> 1:02:17.689
I won't.

1:02:17.722 --> 1:02:22.192
If we're going to die, we're
going to do it fighting!

1:02:22.226 --> 1:02:23.460
Abba, swords.

1:02:28.165 --> 1:02:29.066
Square them off.

1:02:30.100 --> 1:02:31.435
Kill anyone who draws near.

1:02:35.639 --> 1:02:37.441
Enough with the farewells.

1:02:38.442 --> 1:02:39.476
Fight.

1:02:42.714 --> 1:02:45.048
You both want to die tonight?

1:02:45.082 --> 1:02:46.517
Abba, end this!

1:02:50.053 --> 1:02:51.555
Let's end these...

1:03:00.130 --> 1:03:00.964
Go.

1:03:00.998 --> 1:03:01.632
And never return.

1:03:03.133 --> 1:03:03.967
Never.

1:03:12.509 --> 1:03:15.512
You lay eyes on them
again, kill them.

1:03:15.546 --> 1:03:16.613
Standing orders.

1:03:19.082 --> 1:03:23.954
Barrabas, Barrabas, Barrabas!

1:03:27.759 --> 1:03:29.293
They're singing my song!

1:03:32.029 --> 1:03:32.664
Barabbas?

1:03:34.097 --> 1:03:34.732
You hear that?

1:03:36.133 --> 1:03:39.136
Kill a few Romans,
and you're a hero.

1:03:39.169 --> 1:03:40.437
Sent by the Father.

1:03:42.639 --> 1:03:44.174
A hero for killing.

1:03:48.278 --> 1:03:49.112
Yeshua?

1:03:49.814 --> 1:03:51.582
That insane rabbi?

1:03:54.651 --> 1:03:56.754
Barrabas, come with me.

1:03:59.590 --> 1:04:01.191
You're going to see the prefect.

1:04:02.559 --> 1:04:04.094
I guess the Romans
have a special treat

1:04:04.127 --> 1:04:05.462
in mind for me, boys.

1:04:12.569 --> 1:04:13.504
What about us?

1:04:16.540 --> 1:04:17.541
Patience, thief.

1:04:18.642 --> 1:04:19.744
Your time will come.

1:04:25.649 --> 1:04:27.752
You really think you
deserved that life?

1:04:29.386 --> 1:04:31.723
You should have let that
girl marry an honest man.

1:04:31.756 --> 1:04:33.290
I was being an honest man.

1:04:33.323 --> 1:04:34.291
By lying to her?

1:04:35.626 --> 1:04:37.094
I love her.

1:04:37.127 --> 1:04:38.595
What would you have me do?

1:04:47.271 --> 1:04:49.172
It's a beautiful day.

1:04:50.307 --> 1:04:52.376
I hate Capernaum.

1:04:52.409 --> 1:04:54.077
The whole place
smells like fish.

1:04:55.546 --> 1:04:58.282
It's work, honest work.

1:04:59.449 --> 1:05:00.685
Possible work.

1:05:02.319 --> 1:05:04.756
I mean, who wants to hire
people like us anyways?

1:05:04.789 --> 1:05:07.391
Who wouldn't want to
hire two charming rogues?

1:05:08.793 --> 1:05:09.794
Excuse me sir?

1:05:11.696 --> 1:05:13.597
We're looking for Darius.

1:05:13.630 --> 1:05:14.766
You looking for work?

1:05:15.867 --> 1:05:16.701
Yes.

1:05:16.734 --> 1:05:18.068
We hear he's hiring.

1:05:19.269 --> 1:05:21.773
He is, but he's a
bear to work for.

1:05:21.806 --> 1:05:23.640
Long hours, and he yells a lot.

1:05:23.675 --> 1:05:25.175
Great.

1:05:25.208 --> 1:05:26.476
Sounds like another
drunken sailor

1:05:26.510 --> 1:05:29.580
who likes to crack a
whip to feel superior.

1:05:29.613 --> 1:05:33.584
He's fair, but he doesn't
tolerate nonsense or laziness.

1:05:33.617 --> 1:05:34.618
Believes a man with character

1:05:34.651 --> 1:05:36.386
should work hard for his wages.

1:05:37.621 --> 1:05:38.823
I can agree with that.

1:05:40.524 --> 1:05:42.225
But does he train?

1:05:42.259 --> 1:05:44.227
We've never made nets before.

1:05:44.261 --> 1:05:45.429
He'll train you.

1:05:45.462 --> 1:05:46.664
At half wage.

1:05:46.698 --> 1:05:48.332
As long as you don't run
off to a fishing boat

1:05:48.365 --> 1:05:50.434
as soon as there's an opening.

1:05:50.467 --> 1:05:52.536
Pretty sure that's
called slavery.

1:05:52.569 --> 1:05:55.105
You have soft hands,
like a woman's.

1:05:55.873 --> 1:05:57.507
That won't last.

1:05:57.541 --> 1:06:00.477
Okay, we'll work for half wages.

1:06:00.510 --> 1:06:03.246
Can you introduce us
to Darius, please?

1:06:03.280 --> 1:06:04.181
I'm Darius.

1:06:05.750 --> 1:06:07.150
I like you.

1:06:07.184 --> 1:06:07.785
You're hired.

1:06:09.252 --> 1:06:10.420
You too.

1:06:10.454 --> 1:06:13.624
Don't have as good a feeling
about you, but I'm shorthanded.

1:06:14.826 --> 1:06:16.627
Come back at midday, you start.

1:06:17.561 --> 1:06:18.528
Thank you.

1:06:18.562 --> 1:06:20.430
You won't be disappointed.

1:06:21.531 --> 1:06:23.668
I will, but you'll get better.

1:06:29.373 --> 1:06:30.474
That's good.

1:06:30.507 --> 1:06:31.341
Very good.

1:06:33.610 --> 1:06:34.779
I had a good teacher.

1:06:36.580 --> 1:06:38.515
Six months and
you'll be excellent.

1:06:41.418 --> 1:06:42.820
Your friend didn't want the job?

1:06:45.489 --> 1:06:46.490
I'm afraid not.

1:06:48.926 --> 1:06:50.895
He's sleeping on the floor

1:06:50.928 --> 1:06:52.697
of a room that I'm
renting for now.

1:06:54.297 --> 1:06:57.534
Why in the heavens are you
friends with a man like that?

1:07:00.237 --> 1:07:01.171
He's my brother.

1:07:02.774 --> 1:07:03.775
Ah.

1:07:03.808 --> 1:07:04.641
Family.

1:07:10.447 --> 1:07:11.448
Keep working.

1:07:43.815 --> 1:07:45.348
May I help you with that?

1:07:47.317 --> 1:07:47.952
I can do it.

1:07:49.619 --> 1:07:51.889
I'm know you can, but
I can carry it for you.

1:07:54.524 --> 1:07:56.526
Your new here on the docks.

1:07:56.560 --> 1:07:57.627
I am.

1:07:57.662 --> 1:07:58.462
Fisherman?

1:07:58.495 --> 1:07:59.529
I'm net maker.

1:08:00.630 --> 1:08:01.631
Assistant net maker.

1:08:04.334 --> 1:08:05.535
Apprentice net maker.

1:08:05.569 --> 1:08:07.739
I'm still learning.

1:08:07.772 --> 1:08:08.605
To make nets?

1:08:10.708 --> 1:08:12.509
Yes

1:08:12.542 --> 1:08:14.444
My father is always
looking for an apprentice

1:08:14.478 --> 1:08:16.781
who will stay more
than a few months.

1:08:16.814 --> 1:08:17.647
Your father?

1:08:18.615 --> 1:08:19.649
Darius.

1:08:22.019 --> 1:08:23.788
This is my brother, Teman.

1:08:23.821 --> 1:08:24.722
I'm Dismas.

1:08:27.725 --> 1:08:29.626
I'm glad to have
met you, net maker.

1:08:31.796 --> 1:08:33.430
I must return to the market,

1:08:33.463 --> 1:08:35.465
but I shall I see you again
if you're still around.

1:08:36.768 --> 1:08:38.301
I'll be here.

1:08:38.335 --> 1:08:38.970
Shalom.

1:08:56.586 --> 1:08:58.689
Welcome back, brother.

1:08:59.924 --> 1:09:01.591
Well...

1:09:01.625 --> 1:09:03.627
apparently they
stop giving you wine

1:09:03.661 --> 1:09:05.062
when you stop giving them coin.

1:09:07.865 --> 1:09:09.599
You should come work with me.

1:09:10.634 --> 1:09:11.969
Darius may hire you yet.

1:09:13.503 --> 1:09:14.471
You know, used to...

1:09:14.504 --> 1:09:16.707
if we wanted more to drink...

1:09:17.875 --> 1:09:18.709
I took more.

1:09:20.410 --> 1:09:21.679
No one dared refuse us.

1:09:27.685 --> 1:09:29.020
Give me some from the stash.

1:09:29.053 --> 1:09:31.521
It's just as much
mine as it is yours.

1:09:32.422 --> 1:09:34.692
And if I did, it
would be none of ours.

1:09:35.625 --> 1:09:36.459
So, no.

1:09:38.395 --> 1:09:39.030
Fine.

1:09:42.867 --> 1:09:44.334
I'll make my own money.

1:09:46.938 --> 1:09:49.539
That Yeshua is drawing
in quite a crowd.

1:09:51.976 --> 1:09:55.512
I'm sure one of those fanatics
has got to carry gold.

1:09:55.545 --> 1:09:57.014
Jotham, no!

1:09:59.984 --> 1:10:01.518
We left that way behind.

1:10:02.452 --> 1:10:05.589
You must change, if
not for me, for mother.

1:10:26.643 --> 1:10:28.079
Darius?

1:10:28.112 --> 1:10:29.714
I have a favor to ask of you.

1:10:30.848 --> 1:10:31.682
Ask it.

1:10:33.583 --> 1:10:35.753
There's a rabbi
coming to town and...

1:10:35.786 --> 1:10:36.854
You'd like to take the day off

1:10:36.888 --> 1:10:38.723
to hear this rabbi Yeshua teach.

1:10:38.756 --> 1:10:42.660
Yes.

1:10:42.693 --> 1:10:44.594
How did you know?

1:10:44.628 --> 1:10:47.597
Everyone for miles and miles
is going to hear this Yeshua.

1:10:48.531 --> 1:10:50.101
No sales.

1:10:50.134 --> 1:10:51.736
No clients.

1:10:51.769 --> 1:10:52.970
No boats.

1:10:53.004 --> 1:10:54.537
No repairs.

1:10:54.571 --> 1:10:55.605
No fishermen.

1:10:56.640 --> 1:10:57.675
You might as well go.

1:11:00.044 --> 1:11:01.012
You know...

1:11:01.045 --> 1:11:03.180
But you must do me a favor.

1:11:03.214 --> 1:11:04.514
Of course, anything.

1:11:05.249 --> 1:11:06.583
Take Adinah with you.

1:11:07.351 --> 1:11:10.587
I was going to ask you
if I might take her.

1:11:10.620 --> 1:11:11.689
Yes.

1:11:11.722 --> 1:11:12.723
I've seen the way
you've been making

1:11:12.757 --> 1:11:14.058
fish eyes at my daughter.

1:11:15.993 --> 1:11:17.560
I guess she could do worse.

1:11:18.696 --> 1:11:20.430
You two might as
well give it a try.

1:11:21.232 --> 1:11:22.066
Thank you.

1:11:23.566 --> 1:11:24.735
I'll treat her like a queen.

1:11:24.769 --> 1:11:25.602
Ah.

1:11:25.635 --> 1:11:27.504
Just treat her well.

1:11:27.537 --> 1:11:30.540
If you treat her like a queen,
she'll expect it of me too.

1:11:31.608 --> 1:11:33.110
I see.

1:11:33.144 --> 1:11:35.512
But do treat her well.

1:11:35.545 --> 1:11:36.613
Yes, I will.

1:11:46.057 --> 1:11:47.825
I'm so excited!

1:11:47.858 --> 1:11:50.061
I never dreamed I'd be
able to see the rabbi.

1:11:51.696 --> 1:11:53.731
It's too difficult getting
out because of my leg.

1:11:53.764 --> 1:11:55.733
If you don't mind me asking...

1:11:55.766 --> 1:11:57.201
My leg?

1:11:57.234 --> 1:11:58.035
Yes.

1:11:58.069 --> 1:11:59.602
Are you in pain?

1:11:59.636 --> 1:12:00.470
Sometimes.

1:12:01.205 --> 1:12:03.506
It's a familiar pain though.

1:12:03.540 --> 1:12:06.844
Been with me since I was born,
so I've grown used to it.

1:12:06.877 --> 1:12:09.680
Now, the looks I get,
those I don't get used to.

1:12:11.115 --> 1:12:14.584
Maybe it's your beauty they
notice, and not the limp.

1:12:21.624 --> 1:12:23.794
I'm afraid I won't be
able to get any closer

1:12:23.828 --> 1:12:24.929
with the cart, Adinah.

1:12:25.763 --> 1:12:26.731
That's all right.

1:12:27.832 --> 1:12:29.133
I'm sure once
everyone gets settled

1:12:29.166 --> 1:12:30.901
I'll be able to
hear him from here.

1:12:32.737 --> 1:12:34.672
Well I could carry you.

1:12:34.705 --> 1:12:35.605
If you'll let me.

1:12:36.273 --> 1:12:37.708
May I?

1:12:37.742 --> 1:12:38.541
Come.

1:13:26.390 --> 1:13:27.624
Master?

1:13:30.828 --> 1:13:33.563
You spoke of forgiving
our debts and debtors.

1:13:35.966 --> 1:13:38.669
What of those who have
sinned against us?

1:13:39.737 --> 1:13:40.771
Or against Jehovah?

1:13:43.274 --> 1:13:45.209
Do we forgive them as well?

1:13:49.680 --> 1:13:50.815
If you forgive a man

1:13:51.916 --> 1:13:54.351
the sins he has
committed against you,

1:13:54.385 --> 1:13:57.188
then our Father will
also forgive you.

1:13:59.190 --> 1:14:01.358
If you cannot forgive a
man who has wronged you,

1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:07.098
how can you expect our Father
to do the same for you?

1:14:13.838 --> 1:14:18.242
Do not seek the forgiveness
of Jehovah or your fellow man

1:14:18.275 --> 1:14:20.878
without having a
truly penitent heart,

1:14:22.880 --> 1:14:25.316
or you will be
like the hypocrites

1:14:25.349 --> 1:14:28.819
who pray loudly
and without meaning

1:14:30.754 --> 1:14:33.390
so that they may be seen
as righteous among men.

1:14:35.192 --> 1:14:39.063
If you ask Jehovah for something,
He will give it to you.

1:14:41.365 --> 1:14:44.969
If you seek for something,
you will find it.

1:14:46.704 --> 1:14:48.405
If you knock on the
doors of heaven,

1:14:49.940 --> 1:14:51.275
they will be opened to you.

1:14:52.476 --> 1:14:56.380
With faith as small
as a mustard seed,

1:14:57.982 --> 1:15:00.217
you can ask for a
mountain to move...

1:15:01.986 --> 1:15:02.987
and it will be done.

1:15:14.465 --> 1:15:17.301
Adinah, do you remember me?

1:15:17.334 --> 1:15:18.435
Jacob!

1:15:18.469 --> 1:15:19.770
Yes.

1:15:19.803 --> 1:15:21.138
I remember you.

1:15:21.172 --> 1:15:22.306
I thought it was you.

1:15:23.207 --> 1:15:24.308
My Master...

1:15:25.242 --> 1:15:28.345
He saw you, and he sent
me to speak to you.

1:15:28.379 --> 1:15:30.114
Yeshua?

1:15:30.147 --> 1:15:31.749
To us?

1:15:31.782 --> 1:15:33.250
What did he say?

1:15:33.284 --> 1:15:37.454
My Master told me to tell
you that God favors you,

1:15:37.488 --> 1:15:42.092
because you are meek, and the
meek will inherit the earth.

1:15:44.528 --> 1:15:45.763
Brother, no!

1:15:46.430 --> 1:15:48.365
Dismas, what are you doing?

1:15:48.399 --> 1:15:49.767
Stop this.

1:15:49.800 --> 1:15:52.136
It doesn't need to be this way.

1:15:52.169 --> 1:15:53.871
It should never
have been this way.

1:15:53.904 --> 1:15:55.406
This is the way it is.

1:15:56.473 --> 1:15:58.075
This is the way the world works.

1:15:58.742 --> 1:16:00.477
We've never been given anything.

1:16:00.511 --> 1:16:02.446
The only things we have
is what we have stolen,

1:16:02.479 --> 1:16:03.914
and the only things
that we've kept

1:16:03.948 --> 1:16:05.816
is what has not been
stolen back from us.

1:16:05.849 --> 1:16:09.019
You should know that
more than anybody.

1:16:09.053 --> 1:16:10.754
You don't believe that.

1:16:10.788 --> 1:16:12.756
You can't believe that!

1:16:12.790 --> 1:16:16.026
There is another way, the
way that Yeshua speaks of.

1:16:16.060 --> 1:16:16.894
Yeshua?

1:16:18.295 --> 1:16:22.833
Brother, your messiah is
the reason for all of this!

1:16:24.401 --> 1:16:26.303
Don't you remember Bethlehem?

1:16:28.906 --> 1:16:30.908
Don't you remember Aram?

1:16:32.576 --> 1:16:34.411
Don't you remember...

1:16:36.513 --> 1:16:38.816
Mother would have
wanted us to forgive.

1:16:47.524 --> 1:16:49.126
You spit on the memory of her.

1:16:52.930 --> 1:16:56.500
He also told me to tell you
to get up and walk home.

1:16:57.468 --> 1:16:58.502
Rise.

1:17:11.282 --> 1:17:16.287
Dismas!

1:17:33.537 --> 1:17:36.273
My brother is always trying
to keep me out of trouble.

1:17:37.508 --> 1:17:39.443
Keep yourself out
of trouble, brother!

1:17:39.476 --> 1:17:40.878
But no, he doesn't.

1:17:40.911 --> 1:17:42.546
He doesn't even come out
to the bar, you know?

1:17:42.579 --> 1:17:45.249
Doesn't drink,
does not let loose.

1:17:45.282 --> 1:17:46.417
I'm not trouble.

1:17:49.453 --> 1:17:52.256
What did you say your name was?

1:18:52.015 --> 1:18:53.117
Don't, don't,
don't please don't!

1:18:53.150 --> 1:18:54.251
Please don't.

1:18:54.284 --> 1:18:55.352
I don't have anything
worth taking.

1:18:56.453 --> 1:18:57.287
Now...

1:19:02.626 --> 1:19:05.562
Why would I do a
thing like that?

1:19:07.498 --> 1:19:08.532
Abba?

1:19:09.734 --> 1:19:12.269
You're not here to avenge Tiran?

1:19:12.302 --> 1:19:13.537
No.

1:19:13.570 --> 1:19:15.139
There were a few men
who wanted revenge,

1:19:15.172 --> 1:19:16.540
but that didn't last.

1:19:16.573 --> 1:19:18.409
The Romans caught up
with us a few days later

1:19:18.442 --> 1:19:21.578
and we had more important
things to worry about.

1:19:21.612 --> 1:19:24.381
So you haven't been
chasing me all these years?

1:19:24.415 --> 1:19:25.215
No.

1:19:25.249 --> 1:19:26.684
No one's hunting you.

1:19:26.718 --> 1:19:29.319
Except that damned
Roman, Longinus.

1:19:29.353 --> 1:19:31.388
I'm sure he'd love to
see you on a cross.

1:19:32.423 --> 1:19:33.691
We'll make camp here tonight.

1:19:35.125 --> 1:19:36.026
You joining us?

1:19:38.696 --> 1:19:39.530
I will.

1:19:59.249 --> 1:20:00.551
I'm glad you agreed
to come with us

1:20:00.584 --> 1:20:03.020
to Jerusalem for Passover.

1:20:03.053 --> 1:20:04.455
Of course.

1:20:04.488 --> 1:20:07.057
I'm honored that you invited me.

1:20:10.260 --> 1:20:13.163
I still can't believe you
haven't seen the city.

1:20:13.197 --> 1:20:14.364
It's wonderful.

1:20:15.365 --> 1:20:16.467
I'm looking forward.

1:20:18.135 --> 1:20:19.570
Good evening, fellow travelers.

1:20:21.673 --> 1:20:23.540
You wouldn't mind us weary men

1:20:23.574 --> 1:20:25.442
sharing your
campsite, would you?

1:20:26.577 --> 1:20:28.579
I'm afraid we would mind.

1:20:28.612 --> 1:20:30.047
It will be too crowded.

1:20:32.382 --> 1:20:35.152
With the few of you and my men?

1:20:35.185 --> 1:20:38.055
There are more of us down
at the water with livestock,

1:20:39.523 --> 1:20:41.158
and the other half of our
caravan is on their way.

1:20:41.191 --> 1:20:43.160
So maybe you should leave.

1:20:43.193 --> 1:20:46.530
Funny, I did not pass
anyone on our ride in.

1:20:47.464 --> 1:20:52.302
Now, why would you lie
to a fellow traveler?

1:20:54.404 --> 1:20:55.439
Teman!

1:20:55.472 --> 1:20:57.474
Easy there, friend.

1:20:57.508 --> 1:21:00.444
No one will get hurt
if you cooperate.

1:21:00.477 --> 1:21:01.813
Take what you want and leave us.

1:21:01.846 --> 1:21:04.248
You don't even want to
talk to an old friend?

1:21:04.281 --> 1:21:06.350
Now, where are your manners?

1:21:06.383 --> 1:21:10.153
Our little family has not
been the same since you left.

1:21:10.187 --> 1:21:12.055
We were never family.

1:21:12.089 --> 1:21:13.524
What's the meaning of this?

1:21:13.557 --> 1:21:15.526
We're all friends.

1:21:15.559 --> 1:21:16.493
No need to worry.

1:21:18.730 --> 1:21:20.097
Look, Barrabas.

1:21:21.331 --> 1:21:22.599
We did not know whose
caravan this was.

1:21:22.633 --> 1:21:24.601
Let's just be on our way.

1:21:50.627 --> 1:21:51.628
Jotham!

1:21:53.597 --> 1:21:54.531
No!

1:21:56.567 --> 1:21:57.568
No!

1:22:02.406 --> 1:22:03.206
No!

1:22:03.240 --> 1:22:04.575
I'm sorry!

1:22:04.608 --> 1:22:06.376
He was going to try kill me!

1:22:06.410 --> 1:22:07.244
No!

1:22:10.682 --> 1:22:11.515
Teman!

1:22:12.917 --> 1:22:13.751
No!

1:22:31.803 --> 1:22:33.671
You've grown careless.

1:22:33.705 --> 1:22:34.839
Perhaps I've just grown tired

1:22:34.872 --> 1:22:37.107
of being two steps ahead of you.

1:22:44.849 --> 1:22:48.318
The gods must be
smiling on me today.

1:22:49.353 --> 1:22:50.420
I remember you two.

1:22:52.657 --> 1:22:54.324
Arrest these three.

1:22:54.358 --> 1:22:55.727
Leave the bodies for the dogs.

1:23:17.547 --> 1:23:19.616
What's happening out there?

1:23:19.650 --> 1:23:20.484
Barrabas went free.

1:23:22.887 --> 1:23:23.821
Went free?

1:23:24.922 --> 1:23:26.623
Apparently your
people fear a prophet

1:23:26.658 --> 1:23:27.759
more than a murderer.

1:23:28.960 --> 1:23:30.494
What about us?

1:25:07.557 --> 1:25:08.558
Jotham of Capernaum.

1:25:08.592 --> 1:25:10.795
Thief and murderer.

1:25:12.596 --> 1:25:14.498
By proclamation
of Pontius Pilate,

1:25:14.531 --> 1:25:16.701
you are to be crucified
for your many crimes

1:25:16.734 --> 1:25:18.368
against the citizens of Rome.

1:25:19.971 --> 1:25:21.471
Dismas of Capernaum.

1:25:21.505 --> 1:25:23.373
Thief and murderer.

1:25:23.406 --> 1:25:25.509
By proclamation
of Pontius Pilate,

1:25:25.542 --> 1:25:28.713
you are to be crucified for
your crimes against Rome.

1:25:29.579 --> 1:25:30.782
Yesuah of Nazareth.

1:25:30.815 --> 1:25:33.650
By proclamation
of Pontius Pilate,

1:25:33.684 --> 1:25:36.821
you are to be crucified
for sedition against Rome.

1:25:43.728 --> 1:25:44.929
No!

1:25:44.962 --> 1:25:46.630
Please, no!

1:25:46.664 --> 1:25:47.497
My son!

1:26:02.747 --> 1:26:04.548
What have I done?

1:26:11.588 --> 1:26:12.990
What have I done?

1:26:18.528 --> 1:26:20.564
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

1:26:22.967 --> 1:26:24.434
Aren't you the Messiah?

1:26:26.636 --> 1:26:28.072
Save us!

1:26:28.105 --> 1:26:29.073
Save yourself!

1:26:35.680 --> 1:26:38.749
No angels to come and save us?

1:26:38.783 --> 1:26:39.616
You...

1:26:44.554 --> 1:26:48.092
You never could save
anyone, could you?

1:26:57.134 --> 1:26:58.970
Your savior is a fake!

1:27:05.676 --> 1:27:08.545
We deserve this fate, brother.

1:27:09.512 --> 1:27:10.547
Not him.

1:27:13.050 --> 1:27:14.685
Have mercy on him.

1:27:42.646 --> 1:27:46.150
I'm sorry I didn't
protect you, brother.

1:27:48.652 --> 1:27:49.687
Yeshua...

1:27:50.988 --> 1:27:51.822
Yes?

1:27:54.258 --> 1:27:56.459
I know I deserve this.

1:28:00.998 --> 1:28:03.668
But please forgive me.

1:28:06.636 --> 1:28:07.872
Remember me...

1:28:11.208 --> 1:28:12.509
when you enter...

1:28:13.711 --> 1:28:15.112
into your kingdom.

1:28:18.282 --> 1:28:19.116
Tonight...

1:28:21.686 --> 1:28:22.652
you will be with me...

1:28:26.657 --> 1:28:27.658
in paradise.

1:28:38.568 --> 1:28:39.203
Father...

1:28:43.274 --> 1:28:44.108
it is...

1:28:47.311 --> 1:28:48.145
finished.

1:28:53.184 --> 1:28:54.085
I'm free!
