WEBVTT

00:04.922 --> 00:06.674
We have to tell him.

00:06.757 --> 00:08.259
I hope he's okay.

00:08.342 --> 00:10.811
Walt, our elderly
next-door neighbor, died.

00:10.886 --> 00:13.309
He and Luke were pretty close,
so we have to tell him.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.810
I'm a little nervous
about it.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.981
I think we should break it
to him slowly. Like how?

00:18.101 --> 00:23.073
Well, first we'd say, "Luke, your friend Walt has a cold.
You shouldn't go over there."

00:23.148 --> 00:25.617
Next day, "Bad news.
WaIt's in the hospital,

00:25.692 --> 00:27.535
but he's still crackin' jokes
with the nurses."

00:27.611 --> 00:30.831
Next day, "They're trying an experimental drug.
Fingers crossed."

00:30.906 --> 00:33.625
Next day, "His body rebelled.
He's in a coma."

00:33.700 --> 00:36.203
Next day, he rallies.
Next day, coma.

00:36.286 --> 00:39.290
Next day, coma. Next day, coma.
Next day, eye flutter-

00:39.373 --> 00:41.626
Stop. Just stop. Stop.

00:41.708 --> 00:46.839
Oh. Luke, we have some bad news for you.
it's about Walt.

00:46.922 --> 00:49.471
I'm afraid ...

00:50.551 --> 00:53.020
he passed away.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.556
Um, it happened yesterday.

00:55.639 --> 00:58.438
He finished writing an angry letter
to the Postmaster General,

00:58.517 --> 01:00.235
and he just fell asleep.

01:00.310 --> 01:01.562
Okay.

01:01.645 --> 01:04.819
It was very peaceful.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.151
Not the letter.
That was full of threats, but-

01:08.193 --> 01:10.867
it's okay
to be sad, honey.

01:10.946 --> 01:12.414
You two were
really good friends.

01:12.489 --> 01:17.120
It must be quite a shock
to hear that WaIt's dead.

01:19.663 --> 01:22.507
Um, so do you want to
talk about it, or-

01:22.583 --> 01:26.213
I'm okay. Can I get back to
my video game? It's paused.

01:26.295 --> 01:30.266
Oh. Um, sure.
Yeah, buddy.

01:30.340 --> 01:31.637
Come here.

01:33.635 --> 01:35.933
How weird was that?

01:36.013 --> 01:37.811
I know.
Crazy weird.

01:37.889 --> 01:40.733
It's like he had
no feelings at all.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.403
I'm more worried about the one you showed.
What's with all the smiling?

01:43.478 --> 01:44.946
What are you
talking about?

01:45.022 --> 01:48.322
That grin. "WaIt's dead."
You looked like the Joker.

01:48.442 --> 01:51.446
I didn't smile. You did. it's
like a weird coping mechanism.

01:51.528 --> 01:54.077
You did the same thing
when you told him his hamster died.

01:55.324 --> 01:57.122
I don't know what you
thought you saw, Phil,

01:57.200 --> 02:00.875
but our child just got some terrible
news and had absolutely no reaction.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.956
Doesn't that concern you?

02:03.040 --> 02:05.509
Yeah. He probably just
needs time to process it.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.757
Hmm. Do you think?

02:07.878 --> 02:09.550
Yeah, honey.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.850
Death is a profound thing to deal with at any age.
We all manage it differently.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.136
Some people lock up
their feelings.

02:16.219 --> 02:19.143
Others reach out for comfort,

02:19.222 --> 02:22.852
finding some way to reaffirm
their connection to life.

02:22.934 --> 02:24.607
Are you joking?

02:26.229 --> 02:28.106
# Hey, hey #

02:28.190 --> 02:30.192
# Hey, hey #

02:30.275 --> 02:32.323
# Hey, hey #

02:32.402 --> 02:34.279
# Hey, hey #

02:34.363 --> 02:35.535
# Hey ##

02:39.326 --> 02:40.828
Haley?
Hey, Gloria.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.915
I was driving by and saw this
outside your door, so here.

02:44.039 --> 02:45.507
Thank you.
No problem.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.426
Hey. So, since
I'm already here,

02:48.502 --> 02:52.052
my friend was going to have a pool
party tonight, but he got sick.

02:52.172 --> 02:56.097
Could we have it here? Mm, good
thing that you saw this paper,

02:56.176 --> 02:59.396
- or if not, you would have never been able to ask.
- Yeah.

02:59.471 --> 03:03.726
I'm sorry. But Jay and I are going to
Mitch and Cam's for dinner tonight.

03:03.809 --> 03:05.937
I'm just thinking
out loud here.

03:06.019 --> 03:10.195
What if I get a chaperone that my parents approve of?
Would it be okay then?

03:10.273 --> 03:12.696
Well, I guess so.

03:12.776 --> 03:15.780
You know, it would be good
for Manny to have a little bit of fun.

03:15.862 --> 03:18.206
Do you mind if he stays here
for the party?

03:18.281 --> 03:20.875
Mind? The plan
depended on him.

03:20.951 --> 03:22.953
I don't suppose you've
thought of a chaperone.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.710
Of course not, Mom, because
it's going to be a wild party,

03:25.789 --> 03:27.666
and I'm trying to get away
with something, as usual.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.218
Yes, I've thought of a chaperone- my
uncle, who already said he would do it.

03:30.293 --> 03:32.762
But if that's going to be a problem,
I should just call everybody-

03:32.838 --> 03:34.306
Sorry, sorry, sorry. It's fine.

03:34.381 --> 03:36.930
And thank you, Uncle Manny.

03:38.301 --> 03:40.679
Can you help a little bit?
if I push down, does that-

03:40.804 --> 03:44.149
Yeah, that's helpin'. That's helpin',
but- it's not helping. It's stuck.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.726
I can't believe
I've got 'em this stuck.

03:45.809 --> 03:48.779
I built beds my whole life.
Bunk beds, dog beds, cow beds.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.863
I'm calling you on cow beds.

03:50.939 --> 03:53.408
Oh, that's my dad!
Oh. Okay, he can help.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.406
He's built a boat,
a dock, a lake.

03:55.485 --> 03:59.615
Ah, he did not build a lake. Okay, from now
on, just stop after you say the second thing.

03:59.698 --> 04:04.078
So the cabin door swings open. Damned
if there wasn't a lady pilot in there.

04:04.161 --> 04:07.631
Yeah, well, I hate to admit
it, but it throws me too.

04:07.748 --> 04:11.298
I do prefer a man. Are we gonna
have this conversation again?

04:11.418 --> 04:13.386
Hey, Merle.
Hey. How are you?

04:13.503 --> 04:16.803
Okay. Let me grab that for you.
No, no, I got it.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.385
I will take that beer
you were about to offer me though.

04:19.509 --> 04:23.139
Oh, yeah, coming right up. And you know
where everything is. Go have a seat.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.848
Oh, I missed a call
from my dad.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.559
Oh, let me guess.
Is he calling to cancel?

04:27.642 --> 04:29.110
What's his excuse this time?

04:29.186 --> 04:31.735
You know, that's a really
mean thing to assume, Cam.

04:31.813 --> 04:34.032
I really wish you'd give
my dad a break for once.

04:34.107 --> 04:35.780
Oh, please. You know Jay
doesn't like my dad.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.237
He thinks he's some bumpkin
from the sticks.

04:38.361 --> 04:42.457
Well, I will have you know that Merle Stonewall
Tucker is one of the most respected farmers ...

04:42.532 --> 04:44.455
in all of Hell's Hollow, Missouri.

04:44.534 --> 04:47.287
Okay, you're not
hearing yourself.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.756
- My dad likes him just fine.
- Come on.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.052
Hello.
Hey, Dad, it's me.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.129
Mitch.

04:56.213 --> 04:59.558
I'm sick.
I gotta cancel tonight.

04:59.633 --> 05:03.729
Yeah. Yeah, at 6:00. We're
really lookin' forward to it.

05:03.804 --> 05:05.226
What are you doing?
I said I can't come.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.809
I don't know. Let me ask. My dad
wants to know red or white.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.485
Um, uh, red.

05:10.602 --> 05:12.104
Red.
And I'm sorry.

05:12.187 --> 05:15.157
Okay. Yeah,
Cam says red.

05:15.232 --> 05:16.984
Okay.
Yeah, he-he's so happy-

05:17.067 --> 05:19.820
Knock it off, old man! You are not sick.
Why do you always do this?

05:19.903 --> 05:22.656
Okay, look. Between you and
me, Mervis kind of bugs me.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.993
First of all, it's Merle. Mervis isn't a name.
Mervis is a sound.

05:26.076 --> 05:29.546
And second of all, he's my partner's
father, okay? You're coming.

05:29.621 --> 05:31.464
Okay, Dad,
why don't you settle in?

05:31.540 --> 05:33.918
We don't have any plans until
dinner tonight with Jay and Gloria.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.096
- I don't like that guy.
- What? That's- You like everybody.

05:38.171 --> 05:41.050
Not Jay.
Guy rubs me the wrong way.

05:41.132 --> 05:46.104
Every time I try to do somethin' nice,
he makes this cranky face, like-

05:46.179 --> 05:47.897
Okay. Well, you know what?

05:48.014 --> 05:52.315
I'm gonna chalk this up to jet lag for you,
because it's not like you at all, okay?

05:52.394 --> 05:55.318
You have to make an effort.
it's my partner's father.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.149
Now, give me the growl
that means okay.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.360
Good.

05:59.442 --> 06:04.323
Did you know Walt had a daughter
he was completely estranged from?

06:04.447 --> 06:08.293
His lawyer said she wouldn't even honor his
last request to toss his dog tags in the ocean.

06:08.410 --> 06:11.209
Can you imagine? Phil, do we really
have to go through this again?

06:11.288 --> 06:12.961
I told you I would do
everything possible ...

06:13.039 --> 06:16.259
to make sure that your skeleton ends up
in a science class at a women's college.

06:16.334 --> 06:18.382
No, it's just sad.

06:18.461 --> 06:21.260
That's half of what will
keep me going in my old age.

06:21.381 --> 06:24.430
Remembering all the good
times with the kids. Oh.

06:24.509 --> 06:27.353
Teaching Luke
to ride his bike.

06:27.429 --> 06:29.978
Haley at
the father-daughter dance.

06:31.641 --> 06:33.643
Taking Alex for
her first pony ride.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.946
You never took Alex
on a pony ride.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.948
Oh, right, that was just me.
Mm-hmm.

06:39.024 --> 06:42.528
But Alex and I went, um-
Oh, no, that was Haley.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.739
Mmm.
Huh.

06:44.821 --> 06:47.995
Phil. Look, it's Luke.
He's going into WaIt's house.

06:51.077 --> 06:52.078
Aw.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.422
He's saying good-bye.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.841
He just needed
a little time.

06:56.917 --> 07:00.967
That is so sweet
and so sad. Wow.

07:01.046 --> 07:04.266
He's so much more sensitive
than I ever thought.

07:04.341 --> 07:06.469
They had a special bond.

07:06.551 --> 07:10.101
I wouldn't be surprised if one day he
wrote a book like Tuesdays With Morrie.

07:10.221 --> 07:13.441
I never read it.
Did that guy steal Morrie's TV?

07:23.693 --> 07:26.663
Now setting a course
for adventure.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.661
# Beep-boop-beep-bop
boop-boop-boop #

07:28.740 --> 07:32.461
I've had great experiences
with all my kids, but I-

07:32.535 --> 07:34.754
I might have fallen
behind a bit with Alex.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.422
My fault completely.

07:36.498 --> 07:39.422
Adventure? We are throwing dog tags
into an already polluted ocean ...

07:39.501 --> 07:41.754
where they will probably
choke an otter.

07:41.836 --> 07:44.089
Eighty percent my fault.

07:44.172 --> 07:47.722
Honey, we're bringing closure
to a man's life.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.428
We'll hike up to
the scenic overlook-

07:49.511 --> 07:51.639
where apparently Walt
proposed to his wife-

07:51.721 --> 07:55.771
wait for the light to be just right,
say a few words, share some memories.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.649
It's kind of poetic.
Kind of Navaho.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.526
Now you're getting it.

08:00.605 --> 08:03.654
We'll be sending him off with a level
of dignity that, if we're lucky,

08:03.733 --> 08:05.576
some day we'll experience too.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.154
It's called-

08:10.281 --> 08:11.624
Huh.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.468
Hey, what have you got there?
WaIt's old TV?

08:25.547 --> 08:27.891
He said that I could take
one thing after he died.

08:27.966 --> 08:29.593
I wish he would
have said two things.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.678
I would have taken that phone
with the big buttons.

08:31.761 --> 08:36.357
I bet you guys had some really good
times watching this thing, right?

08:36.433 --> 08:38.652
No. I just wanted
a TV in my room.

08:40.270 --> 08:44.525
You know, Luke, there might be a
nicer way to honor WaIt's memory.

08:44.607 --> 08:48.828
- What do you mean?
- Well, I mean, you guys liked to garden.

08:48.903 --> 08:52.828
We could, uh- We could take one of his
flowers and plant it in our yard.

08:52.949 --> 08:55.793
And then every spring, when-

08:55.910 --> 08:58.914
Ah, there we go.

08:58.997 --> 09:02.092
Sweetie, how you feeling?

09:02.167 --> 09:04.636
Are you sad? Angry?

09:04.711 --> 09:08.181
Confused? Frustrated?
You know, you can talk to me.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.975
I know, but I can't see through you.
Could you scooch?

09:11.051 --> 09:14.681
No, no. You know, this is not okay.
it's going back.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.774
What? He said I could pick one thing.
This isn't picking.

09:17.849 --> 09:19.476
It's looting,
and it's going back.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.687
Oh! You are so mean.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.613
When Walt used to look through
those binoculars ...

09:23.688 --> 09:26.692
and say, "Your dad's one
lucky man," he was wrong.

09:29.319 --> 09:32.289
Hi, Haley. Hi. Stef,
Sam, this is Manny.

09:32.405 --> 09:34.533
What's up, dude? Kitchen's over
there and pool's in the back.

09:34.657 --> 09:36.955
So where are your parents?
They're not coming.

09:37.077 --> 09:40.206
I was told there'd be a chaperone.
There is. It's you.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.790
My parents are totally
fine with it.

09:41.873 --> 09:46.629
Well, exits, fire
extinguisher, burn kit.

09:46.711 --> 09:48.304
Okay, let's have some fun.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.345
Y;  I believe it was
clear the bedrooms are off-limits.

09:51.424 --> 09:55.429
Young lady, I don't think you're ready up
here for what you're planning to do up there.

09:58.014 --> 10:00.233
Not on my watch.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.856
Oh, this was
a delicious meal, Mitchell.

10:05.939 --> 10:09.284
I wish my wife could cook
a roast like this.

10:09.400 --> 10:11.994
You got a good 'un there, Son.
Well, I'm very lucky.

10:12.070 --> 10:14.949
never had a bad patch.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.874
Except the winter of '85.
Remember that?

10:16.950 --> 10:21.547
Oh, I spent several nights
in the cow bed then. Hmm.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.921
Oh, here. Let me help you. No, no, no.
You sit- sit down.

10:26.042 --> 10:29.421
Let's us guys catch up
here a little bit. Yeah.

10:29.546 --> 10:32.641
I'll tell you why I don't like that guy,
and I could never say this to Mitch.

10:32.715 --> 10:36.470
He treats my son like the wife
in the relationship. Always has.

10:36.553 --> 10:39.932
Before we get to dessert,
I've got some presents here.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.933
- Oh, you didn't need to, Dad.
- Ay-

10:42.016 --> 10:44.269
Love it.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.856
Oh, Merle,
thank you so much.

10:47.939 --> 10:51.239
Look at this.
Oh, so elegant, huh?

10:51.317 --> 10:54.537
Oh, this is so sweet.
I think I might cry.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.239
Don't.

10:56.322 --> 10:57.824
Dad, I've really
gotta get home-

10:57.907 --> 11:00.786
I know, I know,
you gotta do homework.

11:00.910 --> 11:04.915
You can't expect me to see a sign that says
"World's Greatest Milk Shake, 50 Miles" ...

11:04.998 --> 11:06.716
and not drive to it.

11:06.791 --> 11:08.509
Sorry, sweetie.
Machine's broken.

11:08.585 --> 11:10.007
Huh.

11:10.086 --> 11:12.885
I just wanted a special day
with my daughter, you know?

11:12.964 --> 11:16.969
Like the time we gave an old man a
dramatic send-off at the beach.

11:17.051 --> 11:21.773
Or-Or the time we drove a hundred miles
for the world's greatest milk shake.

11:21.848 --> 11:23.850
Call us when it
happens, Francine.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.526
Oh, could be
before you get home.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.400
I'm a week past
my due date as it is.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.355
What can I do for you?

11:29.439 --> 11:33.615
The time
we delivered a baby.

11:33.693 --> 11:35.616
We were the only ones there,
and she was so close.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.073
The sound of a pin dropping
could induce labor.

11:38.156 --> 11:40.454
Okay.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.035
What looks good?

11:42.118 --> 11:45.588
What looks good?
What looks good?

11:45.705 --> 11:48.299
Well, uh-

11:51.461 --> 11:52.428
Barn!

11:52.503 --> 11:53.925
Whoa!

11:54.005 --> 11:56.303
- Kids love to destroy things.
- Not Manny.

11:56.382 --> 11:58.635
He's always been
a little bit too serious.

11:58.718 --> 12:01.722
I would make the buildings,
and he will inspect them,

12:01.804 --> 12:05.604
and if they weren't up to code-
ay, ay, ay, the paperwork.

12:05.683 --> 12:10.280
I remember Cam one time rolled a
tractor tire right through a chicken coop.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.449
He was three at the time.

12:12.523 --> 12:16.744
Huh. Yeah, I remember Mitchell one time
karate chopped a plate glass window.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.705
Got 17 stitches.
Ay, yes, I love that story.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.079
Which one of the Charlie's
Angels he was being again?

12:22.200 --> 12:24.498
It's not important.
I think it was Farrah.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.501
Yeah, the thing I remember
is when Mitchell told that story,

12:27.622 --> 12:30.250
how he giggled all the way through it.
I'm sure he wasn't giggling.

12:30.333 --> 12:34.088
Oh, yeah, he-he was giggling, all right.

12:34.170 --> 12:35.843
No, see, Mitchell
has a booming laugh.

12:35.922 --> 12:37.674
It's Cameron, actually,
has the high laugh.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.759
You know-

12:39.842 --> 12:44.018
No, I believe Mitch has a higher
laugh than-

12:44.097 --> 12:45.724
No, it's-

12:49.394 --> 12:51.442
Listen to them.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.944
- Listen to them. Best of friends.
- Oh, man.

12:54.023 --> 12:57.027
I'm sorry I doubted Jay.
He's been lovely.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.614
Oh, well, confession time.
He kind of didn't want to come.

13:00.697 --> 13:02.620
Oh.

13:02.699 --> 13:06.124
Well, you're gonna laugh, because my
dad was kind of hoping he wouldn't.

13:06.244 --> 13:08.417
Wha-

13:08.496 --> 13:12.217
They just needed to get to know one another better.
I am so glad that we did this.

13:12.292 --> 13:13.839
Yeah, me too.

13:13.918 --> 13:15.636
Oh.

13:15.753 --> 13:19.633
That's so funny. What did your dad not
like about my dad? Oh, well, you know Jay.

13:19.716 --> 13:23.266
He's a teddy bear, but sometimes he
can kind of come off as a tough guy.

13:23.344 --> 13:25.187
Yeah, that's true.

13:25.305 --> 13:28.605
As an actual tough guy, you can kind of see
how that would rub my dad the wrong way.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.479
Oh, that's-
I-l could see that.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.691
But, you know, my dad's actually
pretty tough himself, so-

13:35.773 --> 13:39.152
Oh, yeah. City tough.
You know, not farm tough.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.909
Uh-huh. You mean, cities,
where there are gangs,

13:41.988 --> 13:44.958
as opposed to farms,
where there are ducks?

13:47.660 --> 13:49.378
Boy, that's really
jammed in there.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.127
Yep. Why don't you
hop on in there, Dad?

13:51.205 --> 13:54.300
- My dad's got it.
- All right, let's see here. Hang on, Merle.

13:54.375 --> 13:55.672
Here.  That's good.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.595
It's comin'.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.844
- We got it. We got it.
- Oh, there you go.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.301
Cam, why don't you go get us
a couple of cold ones?

14:03.384 --> 14:05.057
We'll finish
this job up in here.

14:05.136 --> 14:06.729
Sure thing, Dad.
You earned it.

14:06.804 --> 14:09.102
Yeah. Good helpin' there,
Merle. Okay.

14:12.185 --> 14:15.405
Wow. It's hot in here.
It's like 80 degrees.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.734
He did that so the Meals On Wheels
lady had to take off her sweater.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.443
How do we turn on
the lights in here?

14:21.361 --> 14:23.409
Of course.

14:23.529 --> 14:29.161
So, Luke. Now that we're here, you want to
take a minute and say what Walt meant to you?

14:29.243 --> 14:31.041
Nope.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.748
Luke, you are going through
something huge in your life,

14:33.831 --> 14:37.881
and I'm concerned that you're not
processing it in a normal, healthy way.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.429
I'm sad.
I'm so very sad.

14:40.505 --> 14:43.679
No, I don't just want to hear what you think
I want to hear. I want you to really-

14:43.758 --> 14:45.556
Hi. it's Kim
with Meals on Wheels.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.474
Oh. Hi, Luke. Where's Walt?

14:47.553 --> 14:52.935
It is like a sauna in here. How does he stand it?
Walt! I'm waiting for my hug!

14:54.310 --> 14:58.440
I have some sad news
about Walt.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.527
He's dead.
What?

15:02.610 --> 15:05.489
- He died last night.
- Are you joking?

15:05.571 --> 15:07.994
No.
He had a heart attack.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.792
A man died.
You're-You're smiling.

15:09.909 --> 15:13.004
I'm not smiling. You are, Mom.
It's kinda creepy.

15:13.079 --> 15:15.127
Hello! Walt?

15:15.206 --> 15:16.708
What's goin' on?

15:16.791 --> 15:20.091
Something happen to Walt?
Mm-hmm.

15:20.169 --> 15:22.763
- Well, I'm sure you can imagine.
- He's sick?

15:22.880 --> 15:25.303
He's in the hospital?

15:25.383 --> 15:27.681
Oh, my God. Just tell me.

15:27.760 --> 15:31.731
Okay. He is dead.

15:31.806 --> 15:34.184
- He is?
- Yeah, he's dead.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.814
What are you doin'
with your mouth?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.403
Nothing.  She's smiling.

15:37.520 --> 15:39.022
She thinks it's funny.
I don't.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.607
I don't think it's funny.
I'm not-

15:40.731 --> 15:42.324
I'm not leaving this with you.
I'm sorry.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.700
I'm so sorry. I just found
out my face does this.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.325
Wow, Mom,
that was so wrong.

15:47.405 --> 15:50.534
Well, it's-it's called
a coping mechanism, Luke.

15:50.616 --> 15:54.416
Some people repress their feelings,
and some people just smile.

15:54.495 --> 15:57.965
It- It doesn't matter. Just put the TV in the den.
Let's get out of here.

15:58.040 --> 16:01.010
It doesn't go in the den.

16:01.085 --> 16:03.053
It goes right here.

16:05.047 --> 16:07.425
I can see it from my room.

16:07.508 --> 16:11.388
Sometimes I'd wake up in the middle
of the night and look down here.

16:11.471 --> 16:15.271
If the TV was on,
I knew he was up.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.774
I don't know.
I guess I'm gonna miss that.

16:20.021 --> 16:22.399
Yeah, that's-

16:22.482 --> 16:23.904
Yeah.

16:25.443 --> 16:28.743
Oh.

16:28.905 --> 16:30.373
Is that any better?
Yeah.

16:30.448 --> 16:32.871
It still feels just,
you know, a little wobbly.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.998
Oh! Oh, my God.
Okay, no, no, no.

16:35.077 --> 16:37.171
That's-That's fine.
Thank you. Thank you.

16:37.246 --> 16:38.247
Ohh!

16:38.331 --> 16:41.505
Okay. it's go time.

16:41.584 --> 16:43.586
Oh. Hey, Doc.

16:43.711 --> 16:46.965
Huh. That's okay.
It's just a cramp.

16:47.048 --> 16:48.766
Can I get you guys
anything else?

16:48.841 --> 16:51.811
Please, no. He's already made me eat the
world's greatest everything on the menu.

16:53.721 --> 16:55.314
Dad, why are you
acting like this?

16:55.389 --> 16:56.891
Is this about Walt dying?

16:56.974 --> 17:01.104
No. it's about what he didn't do
when he was alive-

17:01.187 --> 17:02.689
have a special bond
with his daughter.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.194
I don't want to be that kind of dad.
I want to be Eugene Cernan.

17:05.316 --> 17:08.786
Who's Eugene Cernan? Apollo 17 astronaut.
Last man on the moon.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.910
Coolest dad of all time.
When he was leaving the moon,

17:11.989 --> 17:14.788
he reached down and wrote his daughter's
initials into the lunar surface.

17:14.909 --> 17:19.085
Since there's no atmosphere-
They'll be there forever.

17:19.163 --> 17:23.509
Wow. So every time she looks in the sky,
she knows there's a message just for her.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.463
Exactly. That's why dads
everywhere hate Eugene Cernan.

17:26.546 --> 17:27.843
Oh, no.

17:27.922 --> 17:30.550
Okay, hate's a strong word.
it's just I'm trying to make-

17:30.633 --> 17:33.933
Oh. Oh, boy.

17:34.011 --> 17:35.684
Honey. Okay.

17:35.805 --> 17:40.231
I really want to help, but you know
when someone yawns, it makes you yawn?

17:40.309 --> 17:41.936
You're not gonna yawn,
are you?

17:42.019 --> 17:43.942
I already yawned
a little in my mouth.

17:45.523 --> 17:48.823
Jay, I want to thank you
for helping me do this.

17:48.901 --> 17:52.826
I know Cam appreciates
not having to do it all on his own.

17:54.782 --> 17:56.705
What?
What's that face?

17:56.826 --> 17:59.579
You really want to know?
Sure.

17:59.662 --> 18:03.838
Sometimes I think you treat my son
like the woman in their relationship.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.918
- What?
- Like those watches.

18:06.002 --> 18:08.380
Cam's was all big and manly.

18:08.462 --> 18:11.306
The other one looked like
something Grace Kelly would wear.

18:11.382 --> 18:16.058
Well, that's just because Mitch has a more
slender wrist than Cam does. That's all.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.889
It's skinny, not slender.

18:17.972 --> 18:21.818
And you're honestly tellin' me you don't
cast Mitch in the more ladylike role?

18:21.892 --> 18:24.236
Are you sayin' Cam is
the wife in this deal?

18:24.312 --> 18:26.781
I don't think about it that way.
it's not like it was in our day.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.780
Husband went out to work.
Wife stayed home with the kids.

18:29.859 --> 18:32.453
That sounds like
a clever way of saying yes.

18:32.528 --> 18:33.871
Fine.

18:35.364 --> 18:37.458
They're both equal.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.456
Neither one is the wife.

18:39.535 --> 18:43.585
Yeah, yeah.
I know that in my head.

18:43.664 --> 18:47.840
It's just that it makes me
feel a tiny bit better ...

18:47.918 --> 18:54.346
to think that the person he's spending
his life with is a tiny bit of a woman.

18:55.051 --> 18:57.474
I get it.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.432
Every time I start to feel
comfortable with this thing,

19:00.514 --> 19:03.814
some new part comes up
I gotta wrap my head around.

19:03.934 --> 19:07.063
Yeah. I guess we got no choice.
Yep.

19:07.188 --> 19:12.115
We got two sons, and they're
gay for each other. Hmm.

19:12.193 --> 19:15.163
I'll take it slow
on the way home.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.490
Don't worry. Canceling
course for adventure.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.826
# Beep-boop-beep-bap-boop #

19:19.909 --> 19:21.582
You know what
I'll never forget?

19:21.661 --> 19:26.258
The time my dad spent an entire day
trying to create a special memory for me.

19:30.419 --> 19:33.013
Or when a pregnant lady
slipped in my vomit.

19:35.841 --> 19:37.343
Hang on.

19:38.427 --> 19:40.100
I want to do one thing
before we go.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.478
Hey.
You on your way home?

19:43.557 --> 19:46.276
Just about.
How's everything there?

19:50.773 --> 19:55.745
Actually, it's pretty great.
I can't wait to see you.

19:55.820 --> 19:57.868
Me too.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.574
Okay.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.669
Let's hit it.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.587
I don't know.

20:05.663 --> 20:08.712
Feel like maybe we should get
some food on the way home.

20:08.791 --> 20:09.792
Don't.

20:11.544 --> 20:14.514
Maybe a nice tuna melt.
Stop it.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.734
I did what I could, Mom.

20:27.810 --> 20:31.531
It was a nightmare. I can't tell you how
many times I turned off the bathroom light.

20:31.605 --> 20:32.731
Haley!

20:33.983 --> 20:35.656
Oh, crap. Listen, Gloria.

20:35.735 --> 20:38.409
Okay. Everything I told you
technically was not-

20:38.487 --> 20:42.117
You lied to me so that you could
have a party without supervision!

20:42.199 --> 20:44.452
Oh, I had plenty
of supervision.

20:44.535 --> 20:47.288
He was running around all night
with his coasters and vacuum ...

20:47.371 --> 20:48.998
and his
"make good choices" speech.

20:49.123 --> 20:51.967
Good. Somebody needed to be responsible.
Thank you.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.340
Not you. You take rules
too seriously.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.843
- I'm in trouble?
- You are 13.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.924
You're not supposed to be
vacuuming the party.

20:59.049 --> 21:02.474
You're supposed to be
enjoying the party. Exactly.

21:02.553 --> 21:04.726
A party that you
shouldn't have been having!

21:04.805 --> 21:06.478
Seems like you're
sending mixed signals here.

21:06.557 --> 21:08.776
Yeah. Maybe I should get
my friends and leave-

21:08.851 --> 21:11.821
No, you're in trouble, little young lady.
You're having this party.

21:11.896 --> 21:14.274
What? They've been using
glassware by the pool,

21:14.356 --> 21:16.950
putting feet on the furniture and
begging girls to kiss each other.

21:17.026 --> 21:20.872
Yes. All the things that
you should have been doing!

21:20.946 --> 21:25.076
Yeah, all those things are fine.
Go. Have fun and go crazy!

21:25.159 --> 21:26.786
But he's gonna
ruin my party.

21:26.869 --> 21:29.543
Two birds with one bullet.

21:35.920 --> 21:36.921
English - US - PSDH
