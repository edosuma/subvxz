02:10.811 --> 02:15.111
l'm not sleepy.
Please tell me a story, Mommy.

02:15.749 --> 02:18.980
All right, sweetie. l'll read you a story.

02:19.753 --> 02:21.812
lt's a very strange story.

02:22.122 --> 02:25.250
But you'll have to promise me
you'll go to sleep afterwards.

02:25.325 --> 02:26.690
l promise.

02:27.093 --> 02:29.118
l hope you like it, Jane.

02:29.896 --> 02:31.420
<i>lt's an Arabian Nights tale...</i>

02:32.866 --> 02:34.697
about a sailor named Sinbad.

02:34.768 --> 02:37.328
- Sinbad?
- Yes.

02:37.671 --> 02:40.196
lt all happened many years ago...

02:40.273 --> 02:44.403
when our Earth was such a very little,
lonely grain of sand...

02:44.744 --> 02:46.769
lost in a myriad of stars.

02:48.181 --> 02:50.945
<i>It was in those earIy days of mankind...</i>

02:51.017 --> 02:53.247
<i>that a great hero was born.</i>

02:54.287 --> 02:56.448
The bravest man ever born...

02:56.523 --> 02:58.821
and, naturally, he was a prince...

02:58.892 --> 03:01.258
the greatest prince of the seas.

03:01.828 --> 03:03.693
His name was Sinbad...

03:03.864 --> 03:06.128
<i>conqueror of the seven oceans.</i>

03:09.002 --> 03:11.197
And he had traveled so far...

03:11.538 --> 03:14.632
to the most strange
and mysterious countries...

03:14.908 --> 03:17.274
together with his brave friends:

03:17.344 --> 03:20.472
the young Ali, son of a great king...

03:21.248 --> 03:23.045
<i>the Viking warrior...</i>

03:23.517 --> 03:25.280
<i>Poochi the dwarf...</i>

03:25.752 --> 03:29.188
<i>the baId cook,
and the Chinese soIdier of fortune.</i>

03:30.490 --> 03:32.583
<i>And now, our story begins...</i>

03:32.759 --> 03:36.593
<i>as they were returning home
to their beautifuI city of Basra.</i>

03:36.863 --> 03:40.424
<i>The peopIe of Basra
were the happiest in aII the worId...</i>

03:40.600 --> 03:45.333
<i>because they were ruIed
by a kind and wise caIif named PaI.</i>

03:48.275 --> 03:52.211
<i>The good CaIif was Ioved
by aII the peopIe in his happy country...</i>

03:52.279 --> 03:56.238
<i>aII except a cunning and eviI wizard
named Jaffar.</i>

03:57.050 --> 03:59.450
l hope there's a princess, Mommy.

03:59.953 --> 04:03.548
Yes. Of course there was a princess, Jane.

04:04.758 --> 04:08.216
What kind of fairytale would it be
without a princess?

04:08.495 --> 04:10.793
She was a wonderful princess...

04:11.531 --> 04:14.864
<i>the IoveIiest and sweetest princess
that ever Iived.</i>

04:15.569 --> 04:17.366
<i>Her name was AIina...</i>

04:18.071 --> 04:20.301
and she was fresh as the dew...

04:20.373 --> 04:23.342
and beautiful as a blushing rose.

04:26.313 --> 04:29.282
But now the princess
is sad and disheartened...

04:29.349 --> 04:31.476
because the hero, whom she loves...

04:31.551 --> 04:33.348
hasn't come back yet.

04:33.620 --> 04:35.451
- Sinbad?
- No.

04:35.689 --> 04:38.920
Not Sinbad,
but someone who sails with Sinbad.

04:39.125 --> 04:40.820
<i>I know. Prince AIi.</i>

04:40.894 --> 04:43.089
<i>Yes, the handsome Prince AIi...</i>

04:43.163 --> 04:46.963
<i>wiII soon be united
with his beIoved AIina once more.</i>

04:52.238 --> 04:56.072
<i>The townspeopIe of Basra
were preparing a great feast...</i>

04:56.142 --> 04:59.634
<i>to honor the return
of their vaIiant hero, Sinbad.</i>

05:00.680 --> 05:03.205
<i>They were aIso preparing a ceIebration...</i>

05:03.283 --> 05:06.775
<i>for the joyous marriage of nobIe Prince AIi...</i>

05:07.387 --> 05:10.447
<i>to their own beIoved Princess AIina.</i>

05:38.718 --> 05:42.449
<i>MeanwhiIe, high in the darkest corner
of the royaI paIace...</i>

05:42.689 --> 05:47.251
<i>Jaffar, the eviI wizard, pIanned an end
to the happy times of Basra, forever.</i>

05:48.528 --> 05:49.756
l, Jaffar...

05:51.064 --> 05:53.897
<i>your most devoted massif...</i>

05:54.467 --> 05:56.492
beseech that you grant...

05:57.103 --> 05:59.094
this humble prayer.

06:01.041 --> 06:02.975
The city of Basra...

06:04.144 --> 06:06.135
center of the universe...

06:06.479 --> 06:09.607
is a great ripe plum...

06:09.749 --> 06:11.614
waiting to be plucked.

06:13.987 --> 06:15.215
Grant...

06:16.122 --> 06:17.919
that it is my hand...

06:18.391 --> 06:19.915
that plucks it.

06:22.429 --> 06:26.365
<i>With that, dark cIouds began to form
in the skies over Basra...</i>

06:26.566 --> 06:31.003
<i>and the peopIe, who had known nothing
but sunshine aII their happy Iives...</i>

06:31.071 --> 06:35.064
<i>feIt the first icy chiII of Jaffar's crueI speII.</i>

06:46.119 --> 06:48.519
And thus, in your service...

06:49.255 --> 06:53.419
may l bring hate, war,
poverty, and pestilence...

06:53.493 --> 06:55.825
to this rich and powerful realm...

06:55.895 --> 06:59.763
subjugate its people
to oppressión and torture...

07:00.600 --> 07:04.866
and thus insure
through terror and tyranny...

07:05.905 --> 07:08.738
that the kingdom of evil is born.

07:13.613 --> 07:16.980
<i>The bIack winds of pure eviI
bIew through the town...</i>

07:17.117 --> 07:19.950
<i>bringing with them destruction and misery.</i>

07:30.263 --> 07:33.721
<i>The peopIe of Basra cried out
in such pain and fear...</i>

07:33.833 --> 07:37.564
<i>that their cries rose
to the very paIace of the great CaIif.</i>

07:39.105 --> 07:40.367
Jaffar!

07:50.083 --> 07:51.812
Where is my vizier?

07:54.220 --> 07:55.915
Jaffar!

08:01.961 --> 08:04.862
There you are. What's happening, Jaffar?

08:06.399 --> 08:08.629
My people are a happy people.

08:11.037 --> 08:13.096
They love their neighbors.

08:16.776 --> 08:20.507
Only an evil spell
could have transformed them into beasts.

08:27.387 --> 08:31.255
Go and fetch the sacred gems,
and we'll carry them in processión...

08:31.324 --> 08:34.020
and everything will be all right again.

08:35.761 --> 08:37.787
The gems no longer exist.

08:44.537 --> 08:47.631
You'll give no more orders,
you silly old fool.

08:49.309 --> 08:50.503
Guards!

08:55.248 --> 08:59.446
<i>But it was too Iate.
Jaffar's power had grown too strong.</i>

09:02.055 --> 09:06.492
<i>The sacred gems of Basra had been
the source of the great CaIif's strength...</i>

09:06.559 --> 09:08.925
<i>and now, they beIonged to Jaffar.</i>

09:11.898 --> 09:13.263
Well done.

09:15.368 --> 09:18.098
Well done, my faithful vizier.

09:21.074 --> 09:22.666
Father, what's wrong?

09:22.742 --> 09:25.973
The people are in a panic.
The city is in turmoil.

09:28.481 --> 09:30.108
What's going on?

09:36.022 --> 09:38.752
Father, l'm talking to you.

09:42.762 --> 09:44.423
Can't you hear me?

09:44.497 --> 09:48.194
These are not problems
for a pretty little head like yours.

09:48.668 --> 09:51.899
You must think about how to
make a man who loves you happy.

09:51.971 --> 09:55.065
Any news about Ali?
When is he going to be here?

09:57.644 --> 09:59.271
A fine one, Ali.

09:59.712 --> 10:03.375
Always running around with that other
good-for-nothing, Sinbad the Sailor.

10:03.449 --> 10:06.043
Running around?
But he's coming here for our wedding.

10:06.119 --> 10:09.054
Now that's quite enough
of this nonsense, Daughter.

10:09.122 --> 10:11.989
You must find a mature, sensible man...

10:12.625 --> 10:15.116
a man with a head on his shoulders.

10:15.194 --> 10:17.628
And who, may l ask, might that be?

10:19.532 --> 10:22.057
- Him.
- Jaffar? Never.

10:22.302 --> 10:25.760
l wouldn't want him even if he were
the only man on this Earth.

10:25.838 --> 10:29.001
My dear Alina, my darling little Alina...

10:29.075 --> 10:33.011
- don't you want to make your father happy?
- Not under these conditions.

10:33.079 --> 10:36.515
lf you've been had by him,
it's your problem, not mine.

10:37.450 --> 10:39.384
l'm in love with Ali...

10:40.086 --> 10:42.384
and he's the only one l want.

10:51.030 --> 10:53.828
Father. Guards!

10:56.736 --> 10:58.431
You're to be mine.

11:00.039 --> 11:03.167
How dare you? Leave me alone. Unhand me!

11:04.043 --> 11:08.173
<i>The high towers and minarets
of the fair city rose before them...</i>

11:08.381 --> 11:11.578
<i>as the mighty Sinbad,
saiIor of the seven seas...</i>

11:11.718 --> 11:13.515
<i>and his IoyaI companions...</i>

11:13.586 --> 11:15.986
<i>drew cIose to the coast of Basra.</i>

11:19.325 --> 11:21.850
<i>But when they finaIIy arrived at the dock...</i>

11:21.928 --> 11:24.488
<i>after being away for so very Iong...</i>

11:24.831 --> 11:27.299
<i>onIy an eerie siIence greeted them.</i>

11:27.667 --> 11:31.535
<i>What dreadfuI fate caused the entire city
to Iook so deserted?</i>

11:35.375 --> 11:37.070
Here. Give me a hand with this.

11:37.143 --> 11:38.667
Wait a minute.

11:39.312 --> 11:42.304
Where is everybody? There's nobody here.

11:43.816 --> 11:45.511
There's nobody here.

11:45.585 --> 11:48.110
l just said that. That's the point.

11:49.555 --> 11:52.319
l thought the whole town would turn out.

11:52.859 --> 11:55.828
You know,
there's something here l don't like.

11:55.895 --> 11:58.159
Do you want us to look around?

11:59.732 --> 12:02.257
No, l'll do that.
You stay here and guard the ship.

12:02.335 --> 12:03.324
Okay.

12:03.403 --> 12:07.965
<i>So Sinbad made his way to the paIace
to see his oId and wise friend, the CaIif.</i>

12:09.308 --> 12:11.139
What's going on here?

12:12.578 --> 12:14.671
Greetings, Lord of the Faithful.

12:14.747 --> 12:17.682
l've returned to a town
where the people have changed.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.217
They're unhappy.

12:19.819 --> 12:22.083
Can you tell me what happened?

12:23.089 --> 12:24.283
Calif?

12:25.558 --> 12:27.617
Calif, l'm talking to you.

12:28.594 --> 12:31.722
Why don't you talk to me?
Don't you remember me?

12:34.634 --> 12:38.900
<i>But the kind oId man's mind
was cIouded by Jaffar's wicked speII.</i>

12:42.008 --> 12:45.171
You're wasting your breath
on that tired old man.

12:51.818 --> 12:55.413
l should have known from the beginning
you were behind all this.

12:55.488 --> 12:58.685
You can't fool me anymore
with your dirty tricks.

13:00.326 --> 13:01.520
Guards.

13:20.113 --> 13:22.843
Now it's time to put you in your place.

13:30.623 --> 13:31.715
Yes?

13:32.825 --> 13:37.455
The extraordinary powers that l possess
make me top of the heap around here.

13:37.864 --> 13:40.992
lt's me you've got to pay homage to now.

13:43.669 --> 13:46.638
Step forward and kneel.

13:54.380 --> 13:56.177
l said kneel.

14:09.428 --> 14:12.397
You'll pay for this, you filthy rat.

14:14.333 --> 14:16.927
You're so softhearted, Sinbad.

14:17.303 --> 14:19.328
lt will be your ruination.

14:30.483 --> 14:32.747
l'm going to kill you, Jaffar!

14:34.554 --> 14:35.851
And then?

14:36.322 --> 14:40.190
Sweetheart, Sinbad had great,
brave friends, remember?

14:40.259 --> 14:44.389
And when he did not return
from the Calif's palace after a long time...

14:44.463 --> 14:46.488
they became very worried.

14:46.632 --> 14:49.396
<i>And so they went ashore to search for him.</i>

14:49.468 --> 14:51.459
<i>Kantu, the soIdier of fortune...</i>

14:51.537 --> 14:54.802
<i>couId sense the danger
was very great and very near.</i>

14:54.874 --> 14:57.274
<i>For though the dock
was compIeteIy deserted...</i>

14:57.343 --> 14:59.504
<i>the cook fires were stiII warm.</i>

14:59.579 --> 15:00.910
<i>He warned the others...</i>

15:00.980 --> 15:04.677
<i>that whatever terribIe deed
had befaIIen their true friend, Sinbad...</i>

15:04.750 --> 15:07.981
<i>the entire town of Basra was in grave periI.</i>

15:10.890 --> 15:13.120
l really wish l knew what was going on.

15:13.192 --> 15:15.490
- Let's get out of here.
- Shut up.

15:15.561 --> 15:17.085
Let's do this.

15:17.163 --> 15:19.723
You go that way, l'll go this way.

15:21.000 --> 15:22.160
Alone?

15:22.635 --> 15:25.627
- And l am not alone?
- Yes, but you are bigger.

15:28.808 --> 15:32.869
<i>When they came to the paIace,
the handsome and brave young Prince AIi...</i>

15:32.945 --> 15:35.413
<i>couId no Ionger controI his heart.</i>

15:36.549 --> 15:40.485
<i>Fearing that some awfuI fate
had come to his beIoved Princess AIina...</i>

15:40.553 --> 15:44.853
<i>he rushed up the stairs
and hoped that he was not too Iate.</i>

15:52.331 --> 15:53.525
Alina!

16:01.007 --> 16:03.271
<i>- Did they kiss?
- Not at first.</i>

16:03.476 --> 16:04.738
<i>Why not?</i>

16:04.944 --> 16:08.880
<i>They wanted to.
They had been apart for so very Iong.</i>

16:09.315 --> 16:11.146
<i>But AIina was afraid.</i>

16:11.550 --> 16:15.213
<i>She knew that Jaffar wouId stop at nothing
to get his way.</i>

16:15.888 --> 16:20.257
<i>His power was so great that he had turned
her own father against her...</i>

16:20.493 --> 16:22.893
<i>and imprisoned the mighty Sinbad.</i>

16:23.329 --> 16:25.729
<i>She was afraid to trust her heart...</i>

16:25.798 --> 16:28.858
<i>Iest this may be some trick
of the eviI wizard.</i>

16:29.168 --> 16:30.999
<i>But this was her AIi...</i>

16:31.070 --> 16:33.504
<i>her own dear, sweet AIi.</i>

16:34.373 --> 16:39.072
<i>SureIy, even the fiendish powers of Jaffar
couId not turn him against her.</i>

16:57.096 --> 16:59.826
Welcome, Prince. Guards!

17:00.299 --> 17:02.426
- Alina!
- My love.

17:08.107 --> 17:09.472
Take him away.

17:24.557 --> 17:26.718
You won't get away with this.

17:26.791 --> 17:29.283
You're beautiful when you're angry.

17:34.100 --> 17:35.328
Follow!

17:37.636 --> 17:39.365
Let go. No!

17:40.373 --> 17:45.037
<i>The sound of the princess's heart breaking
reached great Sinbad in his ceII...</i>

17:45.678 --> 17:49.114
<i>and he knew he must think
of a way to rescue her...</i>

17:49.181 --> 17:51.672
<i>and her beIoved Prince AIi.</i>

17:57.089 --> 17:59.990
l need your help. Come here.

18:05.664 --> 18:07.154
Nervous, huh?

18:08.434 --> 18:10.800
l know where you're coming from.

18:13.973 --> 18:16.237
People hating you and all that.

18:19.211 --> 18:23.045
As far as l'm concerned,
it all began with that story of Eve.

18:27.553 --> 18:30.181
And when they want dirty work done...

18:30.523 --> 18:33.083
they really take advantage of you...

18:33.759 --> 18:36.660
like that evil, slimy wizard up there.

18:41.967 --> 18:44.128
No one can resist my will...

18:45.171 --> 18:48.663
and no one, not Prince Ali...

18:49.642 --> 18:51.906
not even his friend, Sinbad...

18:51.977 --> 18:54.775
a man who l hate more than hate itself...

18:54.947 --> 18:59.384
will stand between me
and my heart's desire!

19:04.423 --> 19:05.549
Look.

19:13.833 --> 19:15.460
<i>FiII it up again.</i>

19:18.404 --> 19:19.701
Hey, you.

19:19.972 --> 19:24.636
Jaffar, Vizier of the Lord of the Faithful,
wants you all, at once, at the palace...

19:25.010 --> 19:26.807
and as early as possible.

19:26.879 --> 19:29.439
Can l stand you a drink? l'm buying.

19:29.849 --> 19:33.649
- l said get moving. Come on. Move.
- No!

20:20.699 --> 20:23.759
You see?
Where's the power you pretend to have?

20:23.836 --> 20:26.566
Your evil will can never touch
Sinbad and Ali.

20:27.473 --> 20:30.237
<i>Even as the fair Princess AIina spoke...</i>

20:30.543 --> 20:33.603
<i>the mighty Sinbad had discovered a way...</i>

20:33.913 --> 20:37.405
<i>to enIist the aid of his friends, the snakes...</i>

20:37.650 --> 20:41.142
<i>to heIp him escape his tomb-Iike dungeon.</i>

20:44.657 --> 20:47.217
They say you have a terrible temper.

20:47.359 --> 20:50.123
l'd like to see them living in the dark...

20:50.195 --> 20:52.186
crawling around all day.

20:53.899 --> 20:56.026
Here, come here.

20:57.503 --> 20:58.993
Be nice.

21:01.373 --> 21:02.772
That a boy.

21:06.011 --> 21:09.572
<i>Sinbad's friends had fought braveIy
against great odds...</i>

21:09.648 --> 21:13.812
<i>but now they faced terribIe punishment
in Jaffar's torture chamber.</i>

21:14.053 --> 21:17.250
These prisoners are very dear
to our lord Jaffar.

21:17.756 --> 21:21.192
They need special treatment.
Very special treatment.

21:22.294 --> 21:24.091
A pleasure, Capt. Rashid.

21:24.163 --> 21:27.189
All right, take him.
Put him on the rack, now.

21:30.603 --> 21:32.594
Be sure to make him comfortable.

21:32.671 --> 21:35.606
He'll be there for quite a stretch.

21:40.779 --> 21:44.715
Put slant-eyes in the hot seat
and warm up the branding irons...

21:44.783 --> 21:47.718
so we can toast his health.

21:49.622 --> 21:52.648
The bald one will do nicely for the piranhas.

21:52.725 --> 21:55.853
They don't like hair. lt sticks in their teeth.

21:56.528 --> 21:58.792
- Lift him up.
- But l have a beard.

21:58.864 --> 22:00.627
Let me out of here.

22:16.949 --> 22:18.780
<i>WiII Sinbad save them, Mommy?</i>

22:19.818 --> 22:21.251
<i>You must be patient...</i>

22:21.320 --> 22:24.949
<i>and wait and see what Sinbad
and his friends, the snakes, wiII do.</i>

22:31.497 --> 22:34.466
Don't worry. l'm not gonna hurt you.

22:52.518 --> 22:56.284
What are you waiting for?
Lower him into the tank.

22:56.355 --> 23:00.257
There's nothing my babies enjoy more
than Turkish delight.

23:06.865 --> 23:08.093
Sinbad!

24:48.700 --> 24:49.928
Come on.

24:54.873 --> 24:55.965
Yes.

25:05.250 --> 25:08.014
<i>WhiIe Sinbad was rescuing his friends...</i>

25:08.220 --> 25:11.883
<i>Poochi the dwarf decided
to Iook for AIina in the paIace.</i>

25:16.361 --> 25:18.989
<i>The wicked Jaffar, wizard of Basra...</i>

25:19.364 --> 25:23.027
<i>used his eviI powers
to fashion a terribIe machine...</i>

25:23.268 --> 25:25.930
<i>that wouId weaken the fair AIina's wiII...</i>

25:26.004 --> 25:28.734
<i>and aIIow him to controI her mind.</i>

25:30.108 --> 25:34.704
<i>For Jaffar couId never be content
to mereIy possess the beautifuI AIina...</i>

25:34.913 --> 25:37.074
<i>princess of aII that is good...</i>

25:37.149 --> 25:39.982
<i>unIess she wouId aIso give him her heart.</i>

25:47.993 --> 25:51.156
l intend to become master...

25:51.263 --> 25:54.164
of Alina's mind and body.

25:55.467 --> 25:57.264
Because only then...

25:57.836 --> 26:01.101
will all five sacred gems simply melt away...

26:02.841 --> 26:05.776
leaving me lord of the worid.

26:07.679 --> 26:10.239
<i>After searching the entire paIace...</i>

26:10.515 --> 26:14.747
<i>IittIe Poochi discovered Jaffar's Iair
in the highest tower...</i>

26:15.420 --> 26:18.548
<i>and so onIy he knew
of the wizard's eviI pIan...</i>

26:19.258 --> 26:21.920
<i>to rob the princess of her goodness...</i>

26:22.060 --> 26:26.121
<i>and controI the powerfuI magic
of the town's sacred gems...</i>

26:26.498 --> 26:29.228
<i>for his own terribIe purposes.</i>

26:30.068 --> 26:33.094
<i>As Iong as AIina withstood
Jaffar's machine...</i>

26:33.538 --> 26:35.733
<i>and heId onto her goodness...</i>

26:35.974 --> 26:38.204
<i>he couId not destroy the gems.</i>

26:39.645 --> 26:41.840
<i>Instead, he used his power...</i>

26:42.080 --> 26:44.310
<i>to banish them from the town.</i>

26:51.056 --> 26:54.514
<i>The wicked wizard of Basra
cast his speII on the gems...</i>

26:54.793 --> 26:58.627
<i>that had brought peace, happiness,
and prosperity to the town...</i>

26:58.697 --> 27:01.188
<i>for as Iong as time couId remember.</i>

27:01.400 --> 27:05.496
<i>Four of these he sent to the darkest,
most eviI pIaces on Earth...</i>

27:05.737 --> 27:08.035
<i>where even the powerfuI Sinbad...</i>

27:08.106 --> 27:10.631
<i>might fear to go and retrieve them.</i>

27:15.614 --> 27:18.139
<i>LittIe Poochi ran to find Sinbad...</i>

27:18.216 --> 27:20.514
<i>and teII him everything he had seen/</i>

27:20.585 --> 27:22.644
<i>how the sacred gems of Basra...</i>

27:22.721 --> 27:25.315
<i>must be recovered within seven moons...</i>

27:25.390 --> 27:29.383
<i>or aII that is good and pure
about their beIoved city, incIuding AIina...</i>

27:29.461 --> 27:32.897
<i>wouId be Iost to the hideous eviI of Jaffar.</i>

27:33.999 --> 27:37.162
<i>And so, Sinbad and his brave friends...</i>

27:37.235 --> 27:38.759
<i>Ieft the great city...</i>

27:38.837 --> 27:42.102
<i>and set out once more
on a Iong and dangerous journey.</i>

27:42.274 --> 27:46.142
<i>- But, Mommy, where are the sacred gems?
- Sinbad didn't know.</i>

27:46.211 --> 27:49.374
<i>- But, Mommy-
- Now you must be patient, sweetie.</i>

27:49.548 --> 27:52.016
<i>Sinbad had heard of a great oracIe...</i>

27:52.084 --> 27:55.281
<i>who Iived in a faraway Iand
across many seas.</i>

27:55.687 --> 27:57.018
<i>What's an oracIe?</i>

27:57.089 --> 27:59.489
<i>A wise man who knows many things.</i>

27:59.591 --> 28:01.991
<i>It was there that Sinbad saiIed...</i>

28:02.060 --> 28:06.053
<i>in hopes of discovering
where Jaffar had hidden the sacred gems.</i>

28:16.875 --> 28:20.402
<i>When Jaffar Iearned
that Sinbad had escaped his dungeon...</i>

28:20.479 --> 28:24.347
<i>and set saiI with his men
to find the sacred gems of Basra...</i>

28:25.083 --> 28:28.644
<i>he caIIed forth the bIack source
of his eviI strength...</i>

28:28.920 --> 28:31.684
<i>and prayed to the Lord of the UnderworId.</i>

28:37.763 --> 28:41.199
lllustrious Prince of Darkness,
do not forsake me.

28:42.734 --> 28:46.431
Grant me the power to crush him forever.

28:47.372 --> 28:49.932
<i>And a terribIe cIoud covered the sun...</i>

28:50.008 --> 28:52.875
<i>and bIackened the skies
over Sinbad's ship...</i>

28:52.944 --> 28:54.775
<i>turning the day into night.</i>

28:54.846 --> 28:57.314
<i>And out of that awfuI darkness...</i>

28:57.382 --> 29:00.146
<i>rose up the Iegions of Death.</i>

29:00.685 --> 29:05.315
<i>The brave crew of the mighty Sinbad
prepared to battIe for their very souIs.</i>

31:16.621 --> 31:19.818
Now, disappear.
Go back where you came from...

31:20.659 --> 31:22.684
you evil, filthy spirit.

31:31.570 --> 31:33.094
Dinner's ready.

31:34.573 --> 31:36.404
What's with you guys?

31:36.841 --> 31:39.435
You look like a bunch of weirdoes.

31:42.614 --> 31:45.276
- You missed one hell of a party.
- Darn!

31:46.551 --> 31:48.519
But thank God for that.

31:56.294 --> 31:57.386
Well?

31:58.763 --> 32:00.628
l'm hungry. Let's eat.

32:03.168 --> 32:05.568
<i>They saiIed for many more days...</i>

32:05.637 --> 32:10.233
<i>coming finaIIy to a Iand where
the great and wise oracIe appeared to them.</i>

32:13.111 --> 32:17.571
One sacred gem will be found
on the lsland of the Warrior Women...

32:18.583 --> 32:22.212
worn around the neck
of the enchanted Amazon Queen...

32:22.854 --> 32:25.823
whose charm no man can resist.

32:27.025 --> 32:29.619
Two more are on the lsle of the Dead.

32:30.495 --> 32:35.194
One is hidden inside
the ungodly form of the ghost king...

32:36.534 --> 32:40.994
and the other is guarded
by a horrible and foul beast.

32:42.440 --> 32:45.375
To find the fourth sacred gem of Basra...

32:45.677 --> 32:48.407
follow the first swallow that you see...

32:48.480 --> 32:51.506
and it will lead you
to a place of great peril...

32:51.583 --> 32:55.485
where you must begin
your quest alone, Sinbad.

33:03.061 --> 33:05.359
<i>Sinbad had to swim many Ieagues...</i>

33:05.430 --> 33:08.365
<i>to the rocky shore
where no ship couId Iand.</i>

33:09.868 --> 33:14.134
<i>The strange and barren pIace
described by the oracIe was SkuII IsIand.</i>

33:21.546 --> 33:24.743
<i>From there, courageous Sinbad,
who knew no fear...</i>

33:25.116 --> 33:27.607
<i>went aIone to face unknown dangers.</i>

33:27.786 --> 33:30.254
<i>Deep within the caves of SkuII IsIand...</i>

33:30.322 --> 33:32.984
<i>he soon found what he was Iooking for/</i>

33:33.058 --> 33:35.720
<i>the first sacred gem of Basra.</i>

33:36.761 --> 33:39.628
<i>And now Sinbad can save
the Princess AIina.</i>

33:40.098 --> 33:43.158
<i>Things are not aIways so simpIe
in fairytaIes.</i>

33:43.234 --> 33:47.398
<i>Sinbad did not know there was more danger
than there first appeared.</i>

35:33.478 --> 35:36.003
<i>As he heId the first of the precious gems...</i>

35:36.080 --> 35:38.548
<i>that wouId save the city of Basra...</i>

35:38.616 --> 35:41.608
<i>a great feeIing of joy
came to Sinbad's heart.</i>

35:42.353 --> 35:44.981
<i>But what periIous battIes Iie ahead...</i>

35:45.056 --> 35:48.685
<i>before Sinbad wiII retrieve
the three remaining gems?</i>

36:06.110 --> 36:08.203
Boy, that was a close call.

36:09.714 --> 36:10.874
Yeah.

36:11.416 --> 36:14.783
- Where could they have taken her?
- Who knows?

36:15.186 --> 36:19.145
- What if it's another place like this last one?
- What do you mean?

36:19.224 --> 36:22.751
l wouldn't count on the same kind of luck
a second time.

36:23.127 --> 36:26.255
Confucius say, ''Luck is like a crystal glass.

36:26.664 --> 36:29.064
''Though it sparkles, it's fragile.' '

36:29.167 --> 36:32.295
- And so?
- And so, let's not rush into anything.

36:32.504 --> 36:34.938
- Are you speaking about Alina?
- No.

36:35.039 --> 36:38.133
lt's you who always speaks about Alina.
l must-

36:38.209 --> 36:41.178
Relax. We still have to find the other gems.

36:41.613 --> 36:45.811
Remember, every gem we get back
makes us stronger and Jaffar weaker.

36:46.017 --> 36:49.043
Very good. But where do we find them?

36:49.120 --> 36:51.350
Hold everything. l got it!

36:51.422 --> 36:53.822
- l was thinking-
- That's unusual.

36:54.559 --> 36:57.050
By the way, what were you thinking?

36:59.030 --> 37:00.327
l forgot.

37:02.033 --> 37:06.265
Anyway, Jaffar must have found himself
some other allies than Soukra.

37:07.071 --> 37:08.299
But who?

37:08.373 --> 37:10.841
l can offer a list of possibilities.

37:10.909 --> 37:12.137
So could l.

37:12.210 --> 37:14.838
Sinbad, you choose one, we'll go look.

37:20.585 --> 37:24.316
We could pay a visit
to the enchanted isle of the Amazons...

37:24.422 --> 37:28.153
which is where the oracle said
we would find the second gem.

37:32.630 --> 37:35.622
Do you believe those stories
we heard about the queen?

37:35.700 --> 37:36.758
No.

37:38.002 --> 37:39.799
- Are we ready?
- Yeah.

37:41.339 --> 37:42.601
Strange.

37:44.042 --> 37:45.634
l have a feeling.

37:45.777 --> 37:49.235
Something tells me
Alina's not been brought to this island.

37:49.314 --> 37:52.841
lf she isn't here,
we'll keep looking until we find her.

37:53.217 --> 37:56.744
What's important is that
Jaffar must never destroy your love.

37:56.821 --> 37:59.654
Thank you, my friend. He'll never do that.

38:00.992 --> 38:02.755
Cheropolis, Poochi.

38:05.029 --> 38:06.929
Hey, Greek. Poochi.

38:08.633 --> 38:11.261
- Did you call us, Sinbad?
- l sure did.

38:11.803 --> 38:15.068
Listen, we're going ashore.
l mean, the four of us.

38:15.506 --> 38:18.066
Will you two stay here and keep guard?

38:18.142 --> 38:20.838
l want to warn you all that this is a big risk.

38:20.912 --> 38:23.380
The Amazon Queen is a mind vampire...

38:23.448 --> 38:27.145
and she can suck any man's will away,
if you're not careful.

38:27.251 --> 38:28.912
Even the Viking's.

38:30.388 --> 38:33.414
Listen, if we're not back
in three hours' time...

38:33.491 --> 38:35.686
then you and Poochi come and look for us.

38:35.760 --> 38:38.661
lf we fall under her spell, you can free us.

38:38.930 --> 38:40.591
How do we do that?

38:40.665 --> 38:43.793
How do l know? There's got to be
something in the medical kit.

38:43.868 --> 38:47.201
For example, the ointment we bought
from the magician in Egypt.

38:47.271 --> 38:49.000
Yes, of course.

38:49.374 --> 38:52.343
There is also
the rheumatism potion l made...

38:52.410 --> 38:55.379
that even took the rust off
the helm's hinges...

38:55.446 --> 38:58.779
- and then there is the powder.
- Yeah. Bring the whole lot.

39:03.988 --> 39:08.322
<i>The isIand of the Amazons was a pIace
of Iush forests and great beauty.</i>

39:08.660 --> 39:10.525
<i>Though the oracIe had warned them...</i>

39:10.595 --> 39:14.656
<i>they couId not beIieve that such beauty
couId conceaI such danger.</i>

39:21.606 --> 39:25.975
<i>The first to discover the truth
of the oracIe's warning was the Viking.</i>

40:00.378 --> 40:02.278
<i>Then, young Prince AIi.</i>

40:13.891 --> 40:17.383
<i>Even Kantu, who was wise
in the ways of deception.</i>

40:30.374 --> 40:33.434
Confucius say,
''When the worid is upside down...

40:34.045 --> 40:35.376
''chin up.' '

40:41.385 --> 40:44.286
<i>And finaIIy, Sinbad, whose heart was pure...</i>

40:44.388 --> 40:47.551
<i>encountered the siren beauty
of the Amazon Queen.</i>

41:30.635 --> 41:34.366
<i>Even the great Sinbad
was no match for her magicaI charms...</i>

41:34.438 --> 41:38.135
<i>and she began to weave
her enchanted web around his wiII...</i>

41:38.209 --> 41:41.007
<i>as she had with so many brave men before.</i>

41:41.078 --> 41:43.979
<i>The beautifuI queen
caused Sinbad to forget...</i>

41:44.048 --> 41:45.845
<i>the oracIe's warning.</i>

41:45.950 --> 41:50.046
<i>She danced and spun
round and round the mighty Sinbad.</i>

41:50.588 --> 41:54.388
<i>The great saiIor feII into a trance,
a waking dream...</i>

41:54.458 --> 41:58.292
<i>in which he forgot aII about the danger
to his IoyaI crew.</i>

41:59.463 --> 42:01.761
<i>He forgot the purpose of their journey...</i>

42:01.833 --> 42:04.597
<i>to find the sacred gems
and save Princess AIina...</i>

42:04.669 --> 42:06.933
<i>and their home, beautifuI Basra.</i>

42:07.004 --> 42:11.498
<i>OnIy he and the ebony beauty before him
existed in a state of sheer bIiss.</i>

42:14.245 --> 42:17.646
<i>And as if things were not bIeak enough
for nobIe Sinbad...</i>

42:17.715 --> 42:20.707
<i>Jaffar was joined by another sinister aIIy...</i>

42:20.785 --> 42:23.253
<i>skiIIed in the arts of bIack magic/</i>

42:23.321 --> 42:25.846
<i>a wicked sorceress named Soukra.</i>

42:26.357 --> 42:29.793
So this is your famous
brainwashing machine?

42:31.696 --> 42:34.665
Rashid, do your stuff.

42:36.767 --> 42:39.133
Brainwash or no brainwash...

42:40.838 --> 42:42.806
with Ali still around...

42:42.874 --> 42:45.342
you're never going to get control of her.

42:45.409 --> 42:46.706
l know that.

42:46.777 --> 42:49.507
l sometimes wonder whose side you're on.

42:49.847 --> 42:53.681
l'm on my side. l'm always on my side.

42:54.318 --> 42:56.718
Beware of your ambitions, Soukra.

42:58.456 --> 43:02.256
You must be second to someone.
Why not me?

43:02.627 --> 43:05.528
Have you taken your medication
this morning?

43:06.864 --> 43:09.799
Can puppy love for Prince Ali...

43:10.067 --> 43:12.592
be feeding such fierce resistance?

43:13.704 --> 43:17.697
Her love for anyone but me
must be suffocated.

43:23.581 --> 43:26.675
Most powerful Lord of Darkness...

43:27.852 --> 43:30.844
<i>And Jaffar's diaboIic prayers
were answered...</i>

43:31.055 --> 43:35.321
<i>for the mighty Sinbad
had faIIen to the seductress's charms...</i>

43:35.393 --> 43:39.352
<i>and he did not recognize
the dire periI to himseIf...</i>

43:39.430 --> 43:41.421
<i>and his brave companions.</i>

43:45.369 --> 43:49.305
<i>One by one, they caIIed out
to their great Ieader for heIp.</i>

43:53.844 --> 43:58.213
<i>But so much in the enchantress' speII
was the vaIiant Sinbad...</i>

43:58.549 --> 44:02.986
<i>that aII he couId see was the magicaI beauty
of this goddess queen...</i>

44:03.387 --> 44:05.321
<i>of the Amazon warriors.</i>

44:13.698 --> 44:17.259
Come along, my dear.
Why don't we relax for a while?

44:33.784 --> 44:36.218
Okay, Poochi. Time's up.

44:36.520 --> 44:38.283
Let's go and look for them.

44:38.356 --> 44:41.689
Are you sure that's a good idea?
l'm scared to death.

44:41.759 --> 44:44.284
Do you think l'm not scared, too?

44:45.463 --> 44:49.422
We've got to help them if they're in trouble.
So let's go.

45:03.814 --> 45:05.839
Okay. But you first.

45:10.654 --> 45:14.385
<i>WhiIe the dwarf and the cook
sought to rescue their comrades...</i>

45:14.458 --> 45:18.258
<i>the Amazon Queen's hoId
on Sinbad and his shipmates...</i>

45:18.329 --> 45:20.320
<i>grew ever more powerfuI.</i>

45:33.010 --> 45:36.446
<i>BeautifuI Princess AIina
feII ever deeper into despair...</i>

45:36.514 --> 45:38.812
<i>as she watched each of Sinbad's crew...</i>

45:38.883 --> 45:42.546
<i>succumb to the eviI charms
of the Amazon enchantress.</i>

45:55.466 --> 45:58.128
<i>FinaIIy, her beIoved AIi stood aIone...</i>

45:58.202 --> 46:01.137
<i>against the wickedness
of the queen's beauty.</i>

46:01.405 --> 46:04.568
Ali, honey, please don't give in.

46:10.081 --> 46:11.571
Don't give in.

46:13.918 --> 46:15.146
l won't.

46:20.658 --> 46:23.627
Magnificent, Farida...

46:24.195 --> 46:27.392
my beautiful black pawn.

46:28.866 --> 46:31.027
l'm winning!

46:32.069 --> 46:35.436
Remember what your heart
is made of, Jaffar.

46:36.907 --> 46:39.740
You could crack that fingernail.

46:45.950 --> 46:48.475
<i>With bravery many times his size...</i>

46:48.752 --> 46:52.552
<i>Poochi searched hard for his friend
and brave Ieader, Sinbad.</i>

46:59.230 --> 47:02.097
<i>When he finaIIy found him,
he feared he was too Iate...</i>

47:02.166 --> 47:05.499
<i>for Sinbad was wrapped in the arms
of Temptation herseIf.</i>

47:05.569 --> 47:07.696
Gosh, you're sure beautiful.

47:13.077 --> 47:17.104
<i>The cIever dwarf took the powerfuI potion
that the cook had given him...</i>

47:17.181 --> 47:21.174
<i>and prayed that it was strong enough
to uncIoud Sinbad's mind.</i>

47:41.906 --> 47:43.737
What's wrong, Sinbad?

47:48.679 --> 47:50.806
You chose the wrong side.

47:51.415 --> 47:54.111
Just think,
we could have had a lot of fun together.

47:58.289 --> 47:59.313
No!

47:59.957 --> 48:02.289
He's got the second gem.

48:09.466 --> 48:12.833
l gave her youth and beauty...

48:13.304 --> 48:16.239
and she's let them all off with their lives.

48:16.407 --> 48:18.034
She disobeyed me!

48:19.009 --> 48:22.570
But she's got what she deserves,
the old hag.

48:22.646 --> 48:26.138
<i>Jaffar, that's two down and three to go.</i>

48:28.452 --> 48:30.249
l can trust no one...

48:31.021 --> 48:32.682
let alone a woman.

48:32.756 --> 48:34.223
No, Jaffar...

48:34.625 --> 48:36.855
l'm different and you know it.

48:37.261 --> 48:39.354
With me, you are invincible.

48:39.430 --> 48:41.830
l don't need you, Soukra!

48:49.039 --> 48:52.270
<i>Sinbad's men knew
they had escaped great danger...</i>

48:52.343 --> 48:56.006
<i>and yet they were sad
to depart this enchanted isIand.</i>

48:58.048 --> 48:59.948
What are you thinking?

49:01.952 --> 49:04.045
About the lsland of Charms.

49:05.656 --> 49:08.022
l don't remember a thing, but...

49:09.493 --> 49:11.256
from the perfume...

49:11.595 --> 49:15.224
l have a feeling
that it must have been somewhat pleasant.

49:16.166 --> 49:17.394
Me, too.

49:23.741 --> 49:27.268
ln the name of all that is evil...

49:27.745 --> 49:32.148
l call upon the winds of utter destruction.

49:41.191 --> 49:45.651
<i>The terribIe power of Jaffar,
satanic sorcerer of Basra...</i>

49:45.729 --> 49:50.530
<i>bIew with such fury that even Sinbad,
the greatest saiIor of aII the seas...</i>

49:50.601 --> 49:52.262
<i>couId not prevaiI.</i>

49:56.573 --> 50:00.566
<i>His ship was cast on the dark shores
of the IsIe of the Dead...</i>

50:00.678 --> 50:04.136
<i>from which no earthIy being
had ever escaped aIive.</i>

50:29.273 --> 50:32.436
<i>AII around the ship, the faIIen warriors Iay.</i>

50:33.277 --> 50:37.577
<i>Once brave men from another time,
another Iand...</i>

50:38.282 --> 50:41.740
<i>whose souIs had been brought
to this terribIe pIace...</i>

50:42.453 --> 50:45.422
<i>to do the bidding of eviI.</i>

51:28.665 --> 51:31.566
<i>Their earthIy remains had turned to dust...</i>

51:32.169 --> 51:35.434
<i>but their vaIiant spirits
had been taken from them...</i>

51:35.506 --> 51:38.339
<i>to await this dreadfuI moment.</i>

51:45.516 --> 51:48.542
Wow! What is it this time?

51:48.619 --> 51:52.316
- Whatever it is, Poochi, it means trouble.
- You're right.

51:52.423 --> 51:54.391
l wonder where we are now.

51:54.458 --> 51:57.052
lt looks like the afterworid, Viking.

51:57.761 --> 51:59.661
Maybe we are even dead.

52:01.265 --> 52:04.063
Better dead than to never see Alina again.

52:04.134 --> 52:07.501
You'll see her again, Prince. We're not dead.

52:10.274 --> 52:13.368
This is just another one of Jaffar's tricks...

52:13.977 --> 52:17.140
but now we have two gems we can use
to fight him.

52:17.781 --> 52:21.342
<i>The ghost warriors must now obey
their satanic destiny...</i>

52:21.418 --> 52:24.819
<i>and do battIe
with the great and mighty Sinbad.</i>

54:36.720 --> 54:37.948
Damn it.

54:41.758 --> 54:44.727
- Get them. Poochi, get my sword, quick.
- Yes.

54:46.663 --> 54:48.460
- Here.
- You two, take cover.

54:48.532 --> 54:49.624
Okay.

55:35.112 --> 55:38.639
<i>On ghostIy steeds
came the warriors of the dead king...</i>

55:38.715 --> 55:41.741
<i>wieIding ungodIy steeI against mortaI fIesh.</i>

55:47.290 --> 55:50.384
<i>And brave Sinbad
matched his heroic strength...</i>

55:50.460 --> 55:53.156
<i>against the power of supernaturaI eviI.</i>

58:47.548 --> 58:50.244
<i>The army of ghost warriors
was nearIy defeated...</i>

58:50.317 --> 58:54.651
<i>but Jaffar had a pIan to rob brave Sinbad
of one of his greatest strengths/</i>

58:54.922 --> 58:56.446
<i>his IoyaI companions.</i>

59:04.098 --> 59:07.727
<i>The wizard's eviI magic
cast them far out to sea.</i>

59:09.103 --> 59:10.195
Look.

59:11.071 --> 59:12.436
lt's magic.

59:13.908 --> 59:16.741
- lt's incredible.
- We're back at sea again.

59:20.614 --> 59:22.809
<i>But what about Sinbad, Mommy?</i>

59:23.751 --> 59:26.879
<i>Poor Sinbad was Ieft aIone
on the IsIe of the Dead...</i>

59:26.954 --> 59:28.979
<i>with no means to escape...</i>

59:30.758 --> 59:33.591
<i>and he had yet to confront the Ghost King.</i>

59:41.635 --> 59:44.433
<i>- I'm scared.
- It's aII right, Jane.</i>

59:45.139 --> 59:47.505
<i>At first, the King did not move...</i>

59:47.575 --> 59:50.942
<i>but the power of Jaffar's wizardry
was stiII great.</i>

01:00:20.908 --> 01:00:24.969
<i>As the ghostIy knight came to Iife,
Sinbad feIt himseIf weakening.</i>

01:00:25.045 --> 01:00:27.309
<i>He did not think
he wouId have the strength...</i>

01:00:27.381 --> 01:00:31.340
<i>to defend himseIf against
the unearthIy sword of the Ghost King.</i>

01:01:00.781 --> 01:01:03.477
You're losing your power, Jaffar...

01:01:09.523 --> 01:01:11.184
and you know that.

01:01:14.561 --> 01:01:16.529
<i>Without their vaIiant Ieader...</i>

01:01:16.597 --> 01:01:20.055
<i>Sinbad's men had bareIy the heart
to continue the journey.</i>

01:01:20.134 --> 01:01:23.626
<i>But Poochi, the IoyaI IittIe dwarf,
said they must...</i>

01:01:23.704 --> 01:01:27.731
<i>or they wouId bring shame
upon themseIves and their nobIe Sinbad.</i>

01:01:41.155 --> 01:01:42.520
<i>And without his men...</i>

01:01:42.589 --> 01:01:45.023
<i>Sinbad knew he wouId pass
the rest of his days...</i>

01:01:45.092 --> 01:01:47.993
<i>on the IsIe of the Dead compIeteIy aIone.</i>

01:01:48.062 --> 01:01:49.689
<i>Or so he thought.</i>

01:02:07.614 --> 01:02:09.548
- Hi.
- Daddy.

01:02:44.118 --> 01:02:45.585
You're right.

01:02:45.753 --> 01:02:49.519
Just imagine if they see him. Some meat.

01:02:50.224 --> 01:02:53.318
Meat? Who's going to eat meat?

01:03:05.339 --> 01:03:07.830
- Come on, let's go.
- Okay.

01:03:11.011 --> 01:03:13.912
<i>WhiIe Sinbad's men
searched for their Ieader...</i>

01:03:13.981 --> 01:03:18.213
<i>Kyra and her father took nobIe Sinbad
to a secret part of the isIand.</i>

01:03:27.494 --> 01:03:28.756
What does he want?

01:03:28.829 --> 01:03:33.266
He's preparing a fish couscous,
which he says is finger-licking good.

01:03:34.802 --> 01:03:37.669
Although he's an incredibly good cook...

01:03:38.038 --> 01:03:39.733
he is actually...

01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:42.866
Nadir, the famous wizard.

01:03:48.415 --> 01:03:52.010
He's been a member
of the Baghdad Fraternity since '82.

01:03:59.726 --> 01:04:02.126
Baghdad? So you're not from here?

01:04:02.629 --> 01:04:05.928
We came here in a flying machine.
Daddy invented it.

01:04:06.567 --> 01:04:09.900
But with the first gust of wind,
down we came.

01:04:11.638 --> 01:04:14.835
And since then,
we've been living hidden in here...

01:04:15.409 --> 01:04:18.970
because those monsters eat anything
they come across.

01:04:19.479 --> 01:04:20.673
Really?

01:04:21.682 --> 01:04:24.617
- By the way, are you hungry?
- Yes, sure.

01:04:29.256 --> 01:04:30.587
Thank you.

01:04:34.561 --> 01:04:36.358
You should see them.

01:04:36.430 --> 01:04:40.230
They're slimy and squishy,
and all full of sores...

01:04:40.634 --> 01:04:43.660
and they smell real bad.

01:04:44.438 --> 01:04:46.963
lt makes you sick just to see them.

01:04:53.347 --> 01:04:55.941
- So you're the only two people living here?
- Yes.

01:04:56.016 --> 01:04:58.507
The surviving inhabitants ran away.

01:04:59.953 --> 01:05:02.615
To think it was such a beautiful place.

01:05:05.859 --> 01:05:08.225
lt used to be fabulous living here...

01:05:08.295 --> 01:05:12.026
until Jaffar, the most evil wizard of all...

01:05:13.033 --> 01:05:16.799
- You know him, don't you?
- Yes, l sure do.

01:05:17.537 --> 01:05:20.267
He came to the island
and he hid something...

01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.831
leaving those monsters to guard it.

01:05:23.477 --> 01:05:25.968
That's when all this trouble began.

01:05:29.149 --> 01:05:33.813
- Now you'll straighten things up, won't you?
- Don't you worry, l'll give it a shot.

01:05:35.022 --> 01:05:37.547
<i>WiII Sinbad's friends ever find him?</i>

01:05:38.158 --> 01:05:39.455
<i>I don't know.</i>

01:05:39.526 --> 01:05:44.122
<i>I onIy know that they continued to search
wherever the wind wouId take them.</i>

01:05:46.199 --> 01:05:49.464
<i>Working the ship
Iike the true saiIors they were...</i>

01:05:49.803 --> 01:05:52.533
<i>confident that their Ieader
wouId one day return.</i>

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:01.777
With this, it's safer.

01:06:02.849 --> 01:06:05.147
Daddy, l know it's dangerous...

01:06:05.986 --> 01:06:08.716
but with Sinbad, l can face anything.

01:06:09.122 --> 01:06:10.987
Okay, show me the way.

01:06:12.826 --> 01:06:14.225
Don't worry.

01:06:23.503 --> 01:06:24.663
To me?

01:06:31.378 --> 01:06:35.439
<i>The oracIe had foretoId
the fourth and Iast sacred gem of Basra...</i>

01:06:35.649 --> 01:06:39.085
<i>was hidden in the body
of a fouI and horribIe beast.</i>

01:06:39.219 --> 01:06:41.983
<i>And that is where Kyra now took Sinbad.</i>

01:07:56.329 --> 01:07:59.093
- Sinbad!
- Kyra!

01:08:00.767 --> 01:08:04.203
Good work, Jaffar.
This time, you've triumphed...

01:08:05.338 --> 01:08:07.806
and Sinbad is heading for the tunnel.

01:08:07.874 --> 01:08:10.604
Of course. Just as planned. lt's a trap.

01:08:11.545 --> 01:08:12.637
Trap?

01:08:13.013 --> 01:08:14.605
Yes, my dear Soukra...

01:08:14.681 --> 01:08:17.979
he's heading straight
for the Cavern of Nothingness.

01:08:18.785 --> 01:08:21.379
What a meal for the Lord of Darkness.

01:08:21.621 --> 01:08:23.282
l'm not so sure...

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:27.451
especially since he has made pulp
of everyone we have set against him.

01:08:27.661 --> 01:08:31.620
There are times when you do
the most dreadful things to my biorhythm.

01:08:31.698 --> 01:08:34.258
Again l ask, whose side are you on?

01:08:34.901 --> 01:08:36.562
The one who wins.

01:09:26.252 --> 01:09:28.517
Push him away. Come on.

01:09:37.363 --> 01:09:38.956
That's right.

01:09:58.518 --> 01:10:00.782
- You called me?
- Yes.

01:10:06.660 --> 01:10:10.460
<i>And now, the mighty Sinbad
had to face his greatest chaIIenge/</i>

01:10:10.597 --> 01:10:13.498
<i>the awfuI monster
prophesized by the oracIe.</i>

01:10:14.301 --> 01:10:18.169
<i>For unIess Sinbad couId win back
the fourth sacred gem...</i>

01:10:18.605 --> 01:10:22.336
<i>the wicked Jaffar, wizard of aII that is eviI...</i>

01:10:22.409 --> 01:10:23.842
<i>wouId prevaiI.</i>

01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:27.368
<i>Princess AIina

01:10:27.447 --> 01:10:29.472
<i>wouId be Iost forever.</i>

01:11:24.371 --> 01:11:27.863
<i>Sinbad had three
of the sacred gems of Basra.</i>

01:11:28.241 --> 01:11:31.642
<i>He couId onIy hope that their strength
was powerfuI enough...</i>

01:11:31.711 --> 01:11:35.875
<i>to heIp him defeat this fouI monster
that shot boIts of fire.</i>

01:12:56.963 --> 01:12:58.453
Now, Jaffar...

01:12:58.998 --> 01:13:00.397
you're next.

01:13:04.304 --> 01:13:06.670
l am losing my strength.

01:13:11.544 --> 01:13:14.479
This magic ointment
is made from desert cactus.

01:13:14.547 --> 01:13:17.607
lt's one of my father's
successful experiments.

01:13:18.251 --> 01:13:20.685
As you can see, it works miracles.

01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:23.084
Nadir, do something.

01:13:23.623 --> 01:13:25.921
The evil spell is over. We won.

01:13:26.526 --> 01:13:28.926
Your father should be back to normal
by now.

01:13:28.995 --> 01:13:30.087
Normal?

01:13:30.163 --> 01:13:34.259
You're talking about
his so-called magic powers.

01:13:45.044 --> 01:13:48.480
<i>He says, ''Stricki mani, stricki pi,
catch the wind and fly.' '</i>

01:13:51.217 --> 01:13:53.913
No dice, huh? So what's the problem?

01:13:54.788 --> 01:13:56.050
Problem?

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:04.223
He says the bags have to be filled
with hot air first and then...

01:14:04.297 --> 01:14:05.662
away we go.

01:14:05.799 --> 01:14:09.701
l'm no magician,
but l think a nice twig fire would do the job.

01:14:13.807 --> 01:14:16.207
He says, ''Right. How stupid of him.

01:14:16.276 --> 01:14:18.904
''Twig fires happen to be his specialty.' '

01:14:20.346 --> 01:14:23.372
Okay, Nadir. l got the message.

01:14:23.917 --> 01:14:26.579
You want hot air? Here's your hot air.

01:14:33.827 --> 01:14:36.921
<i>And so, Sinbad fiIIed his powerfuI Iungs...</i>

01:14:36.996 --> 01:14:40.898
<i>and infIated the great baIIoons
of Nadir's fIying machine.</i>

01:14:41.401 --> 01:14:46.270
<i>A wondrous sight that wouId bring joy
to aII but the wicked Jaffar.</i>

01:14:50.043 --> 01:14:52.170
Soukra, l am not well.

01:14:54.481 --> 01:14:56.381
But all l need is time.

01:14:57.317 --> 01:15:00.616
My brainwashing machine
has never failed me before.

01:15:01.654 --> 01:15:04.817
So with its help, l'll break her resistance yet.

01:15:05.291 --> 01:15:07.418
Why don't you just give up?

01:15:09.963 --> 01:15:11.692
May l remind you...

01:15:12.365 --> 01:15:14.196
that your lot is tied to mine.

01:15:14.267 --> 01:15:16.667
My defeat would be yours as well.

01:15:16.903 --> 01:15:19.838
Yes, but l fear if Sinbad should get here...

01:15:20.173 --> 01:15:22.198
he'll make this your tomb.

01:15:22.909 --> 01:15:25.537
So, give me your soldiers...

01:15:25.879 --> 01:15:27.744
and put me in command.

01:15:27.881 --> 01:15:29.542
No need for that.

01:15:30.116 --> 01:15:31.674
No need at all.

01:15:32.619 --> 01:15:35.349
When l have mastered Alina, why...

01:15:36.155 --> 01:15:40.182
the power of the sacred gems
will simply melt away.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.929
There you go again,
basking in your bubbles of fiction.

01:15:45.665 --> 01:15:48.395
l'll keep my faith in my sword, thank you.

01:15:48.468 --> 01:15:52.165
And besides, the young prince and l
have a duel to finish.

01:15:52.972 --> 01:15:55.065
You're so competitive.

01:15:55.942 --> 01:15:59.776
Not happy until you've found out
which of the two is stronger.

01:16:07.854 --> 01:16:10.152
You call this a flying machine?

01:16:11.124 --> 01:16:12.853
lt looks like balloons...

01:16:12.926 --> 01:16:14.917
and it's losing altitude.

01:16:21.701 --> 01:16:26.104
He says to throw down everything
and anything that is not indispensable.

01:16:26.472 --> 01:16:28.372
lndispensable, you say?

01:16:28.908 --> 01:16:30.068
l see.

01:17:15.355 --> 01:17:17.823
He says to continue. We'll make it.

01:17:17.890 --> 01:17:20.085
Really? lt means we're almost there.

01:17:22.061 --> 01:17:24.188
And it better be damn close.

01:17:26.499 --> 01:17:28.558
<i>FinaIIy, on the horizon...</i>

01:17:28.635 --> 01:17:31.468
<i>Sinbad spotted what he had Ionged to find.</i>

01:17:32.839 --> 01:17:34.636
There's my ship.

01:17:39.345 --> 01:17:40.710
My friends.

01:17:41.714 --> 01:17:45.150
Sinbad! lt's Sinbad. He's alive.

01:17:50.323 --> 01:17:51.585
l'm back!

01:18:11.177 --> 01:18:14.010
- What did he say?
- He said, ''Here l come, Jaffar...

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.548
''and l'll make sure
that your name is canceled...

01:18:16.616 --> 01:18:19.380
''from the list of accredited magicians.' '

01:18:19.886 --> 01:18:21.877
You're absolutely right.

01:18:24.691 --> 01:18:28.388
<i>With the heIp of Nadir, the good wizard,
and his daughter, Kyra...</i>

01:18:28.728 --> 01:18:32.357
<i>Sinbad rejoined his brave friends
and returned to Basra...</i>

01:18:32.632 --> 01:18:34.759
<i>where time was running out.</i>

01:18:38.471 --> 01:18:40.439
- My lord.
- What is it now?

01:18:40.707 --> 01:18:44.609
- Sinbad and his men are in the palace.
- He mustn't get in here.

01:18:44.744 --> 01:18:47.941
- l only need 10 more minutes.
- Yes, my lord.

01:20:04.157 --> 01:20:07.354
- l'm crazy about you.
- Don't forget Jaffar.

01:20:25.444 --> 01:20:27.537
They'll take care of the soldiers...

01:20:27.613 --> 01:20:29.877
you take care of the monster...

01:20:29.949 --> 01:20:32.179
and l'll take care of Jaffar.

01:20:36.956 --> 01:20:38.947
We'll take care of the soldiers.

01:20:41.761 --> 01:20:43.786
We'll take care of Jaffar.

01:20:48.034 --> 01:20:50.161
We take care of the monster.

01:20:51.771 --> 01:20:53.602
<i>Sinbad entered the paIace...</i>

01:20:53.673 --> 01:20:56.836
<i>knowing that Jaffar was at Iast
within his grasp.</i>

01:20:57.076 --> 01:21:00.068
<i>And now, he wouId Iet nothing
stand in his way.</i>

01:21:15.461 --> 01:21:17.986
For the last time...

01:21:21.133 --> 01:21:25.661
l command you
in the name of all that is evil...

01:21:27.473 --> 01:21:29.031
budge.

01:21:36.749 --> 01:21:37.977
Sinbad.

01:21:38.551 --> 01:21:42.317
Don't be so imbecilic, Princess,
that's an old trick.

01:21:43.289 --> 01:21:45.120
Here l am, Jaffar.

01:21:50.162 --> 01:21:52.153
Now we face each other...

01:21:52.431 --> 01:21:53.796
man to man.

01:21:59.906 --> 01:22:02.602
Man to man?

01:22:02.875 --> 01:22:05.309
You are a man, Sinbad...

01:22:05.378 --> 01:22:08.836
but l am a supernatural being...

01:22:08.915 --> 01:22:11.907
against whom you are powerless.

01:23:44.010 --> 01:23:45.705
Stay back.

01:23:58.190 --> 01:24:00.055
Don't come any closer.

01:24:03.529 --> 01:24:05.326
You heard me, Sinbad.

01:24:08.601 --> 01:24:10.398
l'm warning you.

01:24:22.381 --> 01:24:24.372
You are forcing me...

01:24:24.850 --> 01:24:28.547
to carry out my most devastating act...

01:24:28.888 --> 01:24:31.356
of magical madness.

01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:06.054
How does it feel to face yourself, Sinbad?

01:25:07.026 --> 01:25:09.187
After l defeat you...

01:25:09.462 --> 01:25:13.922
l'll be the most powerful force
in the universe!

01:25:18.604 --> 01:25:21.129
<i>Sinbad now faced the one force on Earth...</i>

01:25:21.207 --> 01:25:23.505
<i>that was his equaI in battIe...</i>

01:25:23.876 --> 01:25:25.844
<i>for he faced himseIf.</i>

01:25:28.814 --> 01:25:31.180
<i>Jaffar had reproduced every muscIe...</i>

01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:34.151
<i>every sinew, every powerfuI Iimb.</i>

01:25:35.087 --> 01:25:37.920
<i>Sinbad's enemy was his own strength...</i>

01:25:38.157 --> 01:25:40.990
<i>turned to the eviI wiII of Jaffar.</i>

01:25:42.661 --> 01:25:45.630
<i>Each powerfuI combatant
knew every thought...</i>

01:25:45.698 --> 01:25:49.225
<i>every strength and every weakness
of the other.</i>

01:25:50.102 --> 01:25:52.502
<i>For the first time in his Iife...</i>

01:25:52.571 --> 01:25:55.404
<i>Sinbad feIt his fierce confidence erode...</i>

01:25:55.541 --> 01:25:58.442
<i>and this was enough
to give the advantage...</i>

01:25:58.878 --> 01:26:00.641
<i>to his demonic twin.</i>

01:28:09.008 --> 01:28:12.102
<i>And now,
the fearsome power of Jaffar was gone...</i>

01:28:12.478 --> 01:28:16.539
<i>for the sacred gems of Basra
Iay in the hands of goodness.</i>

01:28:16.949 --> 01:28:21.682
<i>And it onIy remained for Sinbad
to return them to their rightfuI setting...</i>

01:28:21.787 --> 01:28:26.451
<i>for AIina to be freed
and the beauty of Basra reawakened.</i>

01:28:28.994 --> 01:28:30.325
Justice...

01:28:35.501 --> 01:28:36.900
happiness...

01:28:42.241 --> 01:28:43.708
prosperity...

01:28:49.248 --> 01:28:50.579
and peace.

01:28:53.152 --> 01:28:56.883
<i>And so the power of
the sacred gems of Basra was restored...</i>

01:28:57.389 --> 01:29:00.324
<i>and aII the eviI that Jaffar had done...</i>

01:29:00.492 --> 01:29:01.891
<i>was undone.</i>

01:29:13.105 --> 01:29:14.902
- Kyra!
- Daddy!

01:29:18.911 --> 01:29:19.969
Ali.

01:29:21.180 --> 01:29:23.648
My King. My friends.

01:29:28.987 --> 01:29:31.512
Sinbad, my dear fellow.

01:29:42.901 --> 01:29:44.163
Our hero.

01:29:45.137 --> 01:29:46.365
Sinbad!

01:30:00.486 --> 01:30:02.681
My dear fellow, welcome back.

01:30:03.322 --> 01:30:06.052
Jaffar, my vizier. Where have you been?

01:30:06.125 --> 01:30:09.754
You know there's still a lot of
unfinished state business to be done.

01:30:09.828 --> 01:30:11.625
l forgot to tell you.

01:30:11.997 --> 01:30:13.794
He decided to resign.

01:30:13.899 --> 01:30:15.833
Decided to resign?

01:30:16.835 --> 01:30:17.893
Yes.

01:30:23.642 --> 01:30:24.904
And then?

01:30:25.644 --> 01:30:28.112
And then, our story ends here.

01:30:30.516 --> 01:30:32.780
The precious gems were found...

01:30:32.851 --> 01:30:34.512
the wrong was righted...

01:30:34.586 --> 01:30:36.816
and beautiful Princess Alina...

01:30:36.889 --> 01:30:39.983
married wonderful Prince Ali...

01:30:40.092 --> 01:30:43.653
and they lived happily, forever and ever.

01:30:45.030 --> 01:30:48.261
And Sinbad married his new love, Kyra...

01:30:48.734 --> 01:30:51.828
and they also lived happily ever after.

01:30:52.905 --> 01:30:55.305
Sweet dreams, my little princess.

01:31:39.084 --> 01:31:42.781
Here they are,
Princess Alina and Prince Ali...

01:31:43.088 --> 01:31:44.885
married this morning.

01:31:53.966 --> 01:31:56.491
And now, to our wonderful honeymoon.
