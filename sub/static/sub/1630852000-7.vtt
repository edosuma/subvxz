<b><i>This little light I've found</i></b>

00:08.750 --> 00:12.800
<b><i>Take it in, breathe it out</i></b>

00:15.220 --> 00:19.220
<b><i>A little drum that's beating loud</i></b>

00:21.640 --> 00:26.100
<b><i>In my chest, I hear the sound</i></b>

00:31.320 --> 00:33.750
<b><i>I can feel</i></b>

00:33.750 --> 00:36.170
<b><i>Feel you now</i></b>

00:36.170 --> 00:39.130
<b><i>I can feel you now</i></b>

00:39.130 --> 00:41.890
<b><i>I can feel</i></b>

00:41.890 --> 00:45.370
<b><i>I can feel you now</i></b>

02:15.040 --> 02:16.040
<b>Elle!</b>

02:34.050 --> 02:36.350
<b>You're hurt bad. I know it's painful.</b>

02:39.180 --> 02:40.580
<b>Just hold still.</b>

02:48.370 --> 02:50.500
<b>You can't keep doing this to yourself.</b>

02:52.330 --> 02:56.330
<b>You're lucky to still be alive. 
They nearly had you.</b>

03:01.200 --> 03:03.220
<b>Grant mentioned something...</b>

03:05.450 --> 03:07.420
<b>What's a Blade Runner?</b>

03:13.110 --> 03:15.610
<b>Someone who retires replicants.</b>

03:15.610 --> 03:16.840
<b>Retire?</b>

03:25.950 --> 03:27.530
<b>This has gone far enough.</b>

03:28.150 --> 03:29.390
<b>Walk away.</b>

03:31.080 --> 03:32.220
<b>I can't.</b>

03:32.220 --> 03:34.340
<b>Not when there's one left out there.</b>

03:34.880 --> 03:36.770
<b>His name is Dr. M.</b>

03:40.900 --> 03:42.390
<b>Wait, you know him?</b>

03:42.390 --> 03:43.960
<b>I'm not doing this anymore.</b>

03:44.850 --> 03:47.410
<b>We had a deal. You were gonna help me.</b>

03:48.470 --> 03:51.160
<b>I'm not gonna help you get yourself killed.</b>

04:00.230 --> 04:01.170
<b>C'mon.</b>

04:10.060 --> 04:11.310
<b>In here.</b>

04:27.180 --> 04:28.480
<b>Evening.</b>

04:28.480 --> 04:30.650
<b>Davis, LAPD.</b>

04:31.230 --> 04:34.390
<b>Sorry officer, I don't carry 
parts for police spinners.</b>

04:36.270 --> 04:38.150
<b>Good thing I'm not here to shop.</b>

04:40.820 --> 04:43.710
<b>So, you been watching the news?</b>

04:44.660 --> 04:46.720
<b>Not really. Been pretty busy.</b>

04:54.040 --> 04:57.560
<b>Too busy to hear about someone 
that goes by the name Black Lotus?</b>

04:57.560 --> 04:59.450
<b>Who killed three people?</b>

04:59.450 --> 05:02.190
<b>What's that gotta do with me?</b>

05:08.390 --> 05:12.430
<b>When we were looking for Black Lotus last night, 
you got caught up in the sweep.</b>

05:12.430 --> 05:13.950
<b>Even got detained.</b>

05:16.400 --> 05:18.930
<b>Well, thanks for the apology, 
if that's what this is.</b>

05:22.400 --> 05:24.810
<b>When I saw your name in the report...</b>

05:25.490 --> 05:27.590
<b>I recognized it.</b>

05:35.540 --> 05:37.470
<b>Officer Joseph.</b>

05:37.470 --> 05:39.550
<b>B-4-63-6-7.</b>

05:39.550 --> 05:41.640
<b>A real legend in Blade Runner circles.</b>

05:42.710 --> 05:45.940
<b>Held the record, right? 
A hundred I think?</b>

05:46.660 --> 05:48.020
<b>200?</b>

05:49.480 --> 05:52.470
<b>How many replicants did you retire?</b>

05:54.020 --> 05:55.540
<b>Doesn't ring a bell.</b>

05:55.540 --> 05:57.310
<b>Don't try and play innocent.</b>

05:59.100 --> 06:01.590
<b>Black Lotus is some kind of replicant.</b>

06:02.690 --> 06:04.860
<b>You used to be a Blade Runner. 
The best.</b>

06:06.280 --> 06:09.510
<b>What does she want? 
Why do any of this?</b>

06:15.120 --> 06:17.540
<b>I'm just a junk dealer.</b>

06:22.560 --> 06:24.810
<b>If you do remember anything...</b>

06:24.810 --> 06:26.430
<b>please give me a call.</b>

06:47.960 --> 06:49.150
<b>Elle?</b>

06:53.870 --> 06:55.240
<b>Shit!</b>

07:10.760 --> 07:13.030
<b>Is there no other way?</b>

07:25.820 --> 07:28.100
<b>Not now, son. I'm very busy.</b>

07:32.070 --> 07:34.740
<b>I've been locked out of my lab.</b>

07:47.390 --> 07:49.980
<b>We're selling off the Tyrrell assets,</b>

07:49.980 --> 07:52.590
<b>including the replicant program.</b>

08:01.200 --> 08:03.850
<b>No more games.</b>

08:07.000 --> 08:09.830
<b>They're my replicants.</b>

08:12.530 --> 08:14.460
<b>And one of your replicants</b>

08:14.460 --> 08:17.010
<b>is responsible for four murders.</b>

08:17.330 --> 08:20.030
<b>One of them was a senator, 
for heaven's sake.</b>

08:21.790 --> 08:24.330
<b>I am cleaning up this mess</b>

08:24.330 --> 08:27.000
<b>to make sure that none of it 
ever becomes public knowledge.</b>

08:46.610 --> 08:50.080
<b>You promised me they would be subservient!</b>

08:50.080 --> 08:53.040
<b>A new era of cheap, disposable labor!</b>

08:53.040 --> 08:55.620
<b>But you weren't satisfied 
with that, were you?</b>

08:55.620 --> 08:58.750
<b>Kept trying to make them more and more human.</b>

08:58.750 --> 09:01.420
<b>You left me no other choice 
but to shut it down!</b>

09:01.420 --> 09:04.700
<b>What do you think will happen if these 
murders are linked to the company?</b>

09:04.690 --> 09:05.810
<b>So help me--</b>

09:13.260 --> 09:14.780
<b>Calm down, father.</b>

09:15.340 --> 09:17.060
<b>You mustn't strain your heart.</b>

09:19.860 --> 09:22.230
<b>You're making a mistake.</b>

09:22.230 --> 09:24.620
<b>My replicants are flawless.</b>

09:26.460 --> 09:28.360
<b>You'll see.</b>

09:49.770 --> 09:52.990
<b><i>Dr. Murphy's office. 
How may I direct your call?</i></b>

09:54.260 --> 09:56.850
<b>I'm supposed to deliver 
a package to the doctor,</b>

09:56.850 --> 09:59.020
<b>but the address got smudged in the rain.</b>

09:59.490 --> 10:02.190
<b><i>We're at the corner of Victory and Sepulveda.</i></b>

10:02.190 --> 10:04.370
<b><i>Leave the package with the gate guard.</i></b>

11:53.000 --> 11:55.190
<b>I hope you remember me.</b>

11:57.540 --> 12:00.770
<b>Because I sure as hell remember you.</b>

12:21.380 --> 12:24.570
<b>Oh, we do wake up feisty, don't we?</b>

12:31.910 --> 12:35.460
<b>Let's get right into finding 
out why you're a deviant.</b>

12:40.000 --> 12:41.440
<b>Goodman,</b>

12:42.400 --> 12:44.210
<b>begin the memory extraction.</b>

12:44.210 --> 12:45.500
<b>Yes, Dr. M.</b>

13:05.660 --> 13:07.150
<b>Starting now, sir.</b>

13:46.520 --> 13:48.960
<b>These are the memories I gave her.</b>

13:48.960 --> 13:50.780
<b>Nothing out of the ordinary.</b>

13:51.260 --> 13:53.160
<b>Desert is real.</b>

13:53.560 --> 13:55.390
<b>It's an actual experience of hers.</b>

13:57.870 --> 14:00.020
<b>Well, there must be something.</b>

14:08.200 --> 14:09.310
<b>What is it?</b>

14:10.990 --> 14:12.620
<b>I'm not sure.</b>

14:14.390 --> 14:15.990
<b>There's an...</b>

14:18.270 --> 14:20.270
<b>inconsistency, I think?</b>

14:21.860 --> 14:24.550
<b>Between the memories I made 
and how she remembers them.</b>

14:30.260 --> 14:32.880
<b>An inconsistency in her memories?</b>

14:33.470 --> 14:35.190
<b>You want me to report the prototype</b>

14:35.190 --> 14:37.710
<b>snapped and went on a killing spree</b>

14:37.710 --> 14:40.740
<b>because of a <i>memory inconsistency</i>?</b>

14:41.340 --> 14:42.680
<b>Look at this.</b>

14:43.400 --> 14:45.540
<b>I deliberately created an 
excess of happy memories,</b>

14:45.540 --> 14:48.760
<b>more than the average human has.</b>

14:48.760 --> 14:53.740
<b>The idea was it'd create a buffer to help 
the replicants handle their emotion.</b>

14:53.740 --> 14:57.740
<b>I thought it'd confirm whether or not 
replicants could stay fully submissive,</b>

14:57.740 --> 15:00.960
<b>even under a case of extreme 
stress, like the Doll Hunt.</b>

15:03.170 --> 15:04.220
<b>Wait.</b>

15:05.530 --> 15:06.990
<b>That's not mine.</b>

15:08.210 --> 15:10.760
<b>What exactly does that mean?</b>

15:14.100 --> 15:15.720
<b>I didn't create these memories!</b>

15:28.510 --> 15:30.230
<b>Then who did?</b>

15:30.230 --> 15:31.860
<b>I don't understand...</b>

15:32.540 --> 15:35.360
<b>Why build a clear memory of a specific place?</b>

15:35.360 --> 15:39.700
<b>Replicant memories never fade, 
so artificial ones need a haze.</b>

15:39.700 --> 15:41.330
<b>But this one is crystal clear.</b>

15:46.750 --> 15:48.470
<b>I don't see the point.</b>

15:49.070 --> 15:50.980
<b>No associated emotion.</b>

15:51.530 --> 15:53.010
<b>Why go to the trouble?</b>

15:54.610 --> 15:56.620
<b>Who could do what you're describing?</b>

15:57.580 --> 15:59.690
<b>Creating additional memories...</b>

16:02.490 --> 16:04.860
<b>This is a high level of memory creation.</b>

16:04.860 --> 16:06.380
<b>Not just anyone could manage it.</b>

16:12.030 --> 16:13.320
<b>Wait, stop.</b>

16:20.020 --> 16:21.880
<b>What is that?</b>

16:24.350 --> 16:26.310
<b>Is this memory artificial too?</b>

16:28.280 --> 16:31.550
<b>Doesn't look created.</b>

16:32.240 --> 16:33.910
<b>Are you sure?</b>

16:37.770 --> 16:41.600
<b>Whoever has been messing with her 
memories isn't great with colors.</b>

16:43.750 --> 16:45.850
<b>But this...</b>

16:48.590 --> 16:50.680
<b>This memory doesn't look artificial.</b>

16:53.220 --> 16:56.550
<b>Get her out. 
May as well just ask her.</b>

17:24.060 --> 17:25.150
<b>Enough!</b>

17:32.550 --> 17:35.450
<b>I think you're more trouble 
than you're worth.</b>

17:54.740 --> 17:57.500
<b>W-wait, you--you don't need to do this.</b>

17:57.500 --> 17:59.420
<b>If you want me to stop...</b>

17:59.420 --> 18:02.090
<b>Tell me who's responsible for the Doll Hunt.</b>

18:04.810 --> 18:07.340
<b>Niander Wallace Senior.</b>

18:07.340 --> 18:11.650
<b>Wallace Corp organized the Doll Hunt, 
as part of R&D for their replicants.</b>

18:11.650 --> 18:14.360
<b>It was Wallace behind it all!</b>

18:15.940 --> 18:16.950
<b>Hey!</b>

18:54.630 --> 18:56.900
<b>What he said, is it true?</b>

18:56.900 --> 18:59.950
<b>The Doll Hunt was Mr. Wallace's idea!</b>

19:02.470 --> 19:05.520
<b>The Wallace Corporation 
wants to mass reproduce</b>

19:05.520 --> 19:06.910
<b>totally obedient replicants!</b>

19:07.300 --> 19:09.100
<b>They're still making more of us?</b>

19:13.570 --> 19:17.250
<b>My memories, what of me is real?</b>

19:17.250 --> 19:18.610
<b>All of it.</b>

19:18.610 --> 19:21.050
<b>Everything you want to believe is real!</b>

19:23.200 --> 19:25.570
<b>None of it actually happened, though!</b>

19:25.930 --> 19:27.180
<b>They're fake.</b>

19:27.810 --> 19:30.140
<b>Artificial doesn't mean fake.</b>

19:34.400 --> 19:37.070
<b>Your memories are real to you.</b>

19:39.840 --> 19:43.060
<b>Humans interpret their 
memories however we want,</b>

19:43.060 --> 19:44.780
<b>but I couldn't give replicants that freedom.</b>

19:45.340 --> 19:48.250
<b>So I tried to give you a 
measure of happiness instead.</b>

19:49.690 --> 19:51.620
<b>And my memory by the pool?</b>

19:58.860 --> 20:00.360
<b>It's real.</b>

20:22.470 --> 20:23.830
<b>I did it.</b>

20:30.390 --> 20:32.450
<b><i>I made them pay for what they did.</i></b>

20:33.730 --> 20:34.880
<b><i>So why...?</i></b>

20:51.500 --> 20:54.000
<b><i>Niander Wallace Senior.</i></b>

20:54.000 --> 20:58.220
<b><i>Wallace Corp organized the Doll Hunt,

21:10.860 --> 21:12.570
<b><i>Chasing danger</i></b>

21:12.570 --> 21:15.610
<b><i>I'm becoming</i></b>

<b><i>A force of nature</i></b>

21:17.910 --> 21:21.370
<b><i>Still tied to who I was</i></b>

21:21.370 --> 21:22.960
<b><i>Mm</i></b>

21:22.960 --> 21:26.000
<b><i>New age, I'm waking up</i></b>

21:26.000 --> 21:27.670
<b><i>Can't save myself</i></b>

21:27.670 --> 21:30.800

21:50.150 --> 21:51.900
<b><i>Are you gonna save me?</i></b>

21:51.900 --> 21:54.700
<b><i>Are you someone that I can rely on?</i></b>

21:54.700 --> 21:57.080
<b><i>If you ain't with it, then you'll go</i></b>

21:57.080 --> 22:00.830
<b><i>I've been waiting</i></b>
