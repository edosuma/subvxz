02:09.211 --> 02:12.549
-Are you sure this is the place?
-This is the place.

02:13.466 --> 02:14.759
So, where's Zarkon?

02:17.595 --> 02:18.596
Dad!

02:18.680 --> 02:22.684
Bring me Lotor
and the prisoner is yours.

02:22.767 --> 02:26.813
Meet my demands
if you want to see the Earthling alive.

02:29.858 --> 02:32.569
He's alive! Our dad is alive!
We have to get him back!

02:32.652 --> 02:35.280
We're going to. What's the plan, Shiro?

02:35.363 --> 02:38.366
We can't rush into anything.
We have to think this through.

02:38.449 --> 02:41.786
What's to think through?
It's my dad! We're doing this!

02:42.370 --> 02:46.082
We need to operate under the assumption
that Zarkon will try to double-cross us.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.710
We have Voltron! We can do anything!

02:48.793 --> 02:49.919
-Pidge.
-No!

02:50.003 --> 02:54.716
We can't let this opportunity slip away!
We're too close! Our father is too close!

03:06.311 --> 03:08.187
Huh?

03:09.063 --> 03:10.064
There!

03:46.768 --> 03:50.480
My father has held the universe
in a death grip for millennia,

03:50.563 --> 03:52.440
but he sees it slipping from his grasp

03:52.523 --> 03:54.859
because of your efforts
and because of mine.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.986
With our forces combined,

03:57.362 --> 04:00.490
we would provide the greatest threat
Zarkon has ever faced.

04:00.990 --> 04:05.411
He knows we could topple his empire,
so this is his attempt to tear us apart.

04:06.496 --> 04:10.667
But united, we could forge a new path,
open doors to new worlds

04:10.750 --> 04:13.878
and crush the tyrannical ways
of an old regime.

04:13.962 --> 04:19.300
A regime you ran. We can't listen to him.
He just wants to save his own skin.

04:19.384 --> 04:24.305
It's true. If you return me to my father,
he would surely see to my demise.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.016
And with his most legitimate threat
to the throne removed,

04:27.100 --> 04:28.643
he would only grow stronger.

04:29.435 --> 04:33.189
One less threat to Zarkon
and one less threat to us.

04:36.401 --> 04:40.571
Your father, King Alfor,
once stood side by side with Zarkon

04:40.655 --> 04:42.865
and protected the universe from harm.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.577
There was no foe
the paladins of old couldn't defeat.

04:47.495 --> 04:52.917
Sadly, that time of peace has been lost,
but, together, we can find it once more.

04:53.001 --> 04:57.839
Princess, imagine, a new generation
that could lift the mantle of peace.

04:57.922 --> 05:01.050
The children of King Alfor
and Emperor Zarkon,

05:01.134 --> 05:04.846
you and I, a royal alliance
between Altean and Galra...

05:05.221 --> 05:08.182
- How 'bout we don't imagine that?
- Lies!

05:08.266 --> 05:12.270
- Every word is a lie!
- And what of Zarkon's words?

05:12.353 --> 05:14.981
You think he'll return your father
as he says?

05:15.064 --> 05:17.650
You think the corrupted leader
of a ruthless empire

05:17.734 --> 05:19.193
will be true to his word?

05:19.569 --> 05:21.362
He wants more than just me.

05:21.446 --> 05:23.364
You think he'll double-cross us.

05:23.448 --> 05:27.785
I think he'd do anything to rid himself
of me and claim the Lions of Voltron.

05:31.664 --> 05:35.043
An alliance with the heir
to the Galra throne could end the war.

05:35.126 --> 05:35.960
What?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.087
It's not ideal.

05:38.463 --> 05:42.008
I don't like trusting the Galra,
but it could be our best option.

05:42.091 --> 05:45.428
-No!
-Pidge, think of the lives we could save.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.513
Think of the countless worlds
we could free.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.348
Think of my father!

05:49.432 --> 05:52.602
I'm with Pidge. Let's get this guy out
of here, pronto. Right, Hunk?

05:53.186 --> 05:56.481
I don't know. I mean, if this dude is
on our side like he says he is--

05:56.564 --> 05:58.441
You are saying you're on our side, right?

05:59.442 --> 06:02.028
Couldn't he lead the Galra
toward peace from inside?

06:02.111 --> 06:04.572
We are turning him in
and getting my dad back!

06:04.655 --> 06:06.783
We have Voltron to bring peace
to the universe!

06:06.866 --> 06:09.452
-Don't play into Zarkon's hands!
-That's enough!

06:19.045 --> 06:21.047
Show me Lotor!

06:23.049 --> 06:25.301
Show us Commander Holt first!

06:34.894 --> 06:35.895
Dad!

06:38.731 --> 06:42.360
Now, where is Lotor?

07:33.661 --> 07:36.914
-Can you save the child?
-We will try, sire.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.125
There are many complications.

08:19.248 --> 08:21.125
My son...

08:23.002 --> 08:24.170
Lotor.

08:39.559 --> 08:41.562
Everything's going according to plan.

08:42.395 --> 08:43.773
I still don't like it.

08:43.856 --> 08:46.400
This whole thing
is like making a deal with the devil.

08:46.484 --> 08:49.111
I hate being so far out of range!

08:49.195 --> 08:53.241
Zarkon's fleet is also out of range.
These are the terms we agreed on.

09:01.624 --> 09:03.000
Send us Commander Holt!

09:05.044 --> 09:06.420
Release him.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.631
Move.

09:27.984 --> 09:32.405
Stay alert. If Zarkon's going
to try something, now would be the time.

10:16.490 --> 10:17.325
Pidge!

10:22.079 --> 10:23.080
Dad!

10:24.624 --> 10:25.625
Dad!

10:38.387 --> 10:39.722
No!

10:45.561 --> 10:46.562
Katie.

10:48.773 --> 10:52.735
No! No, we had a deal! We had a deal!

10:53.152 --> 10:54.612
Give me my father!

10:55.488 --> 10:58.282
Lotor was right. Zarkon double-crossed us.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.368
Everyone, get to your lions!
We're going in!

11:00.451 --> 11:05.456
Lance, we can't. Zarkon still has Sam.
If we go in, we put his life in jeopardy.

11:05.539 --> 11:06.582
Allura's right.

11:07.333 --> 11:10.419
If we move in,
Zarkon's fleet moves in as well.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.464
Yeah, but without Lotor as our prisoner,
we don't hold any cards.

11:13.547 --> 11:14.965
We're powerless. What do we do?

11:16.008 --> 11:17.551
We hold our positions.

11:24.725 --> 11:26.102
Where is Zarkon?

11:27.686 --> 11:32.358
The Si-Vim Quadrant on a hostage
exchange mission to retrieve Lotor.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.194
Retrieve Lotor?

11:36.278 --> 11:37.113
No!

11:39.782 --> 11:42.952
High Priestess Haggar,
how may we be of assistance?

11:43.744 --> 11:46.956
Initiate Operation Kuron Stage 4,
immediately.

11:49.166 --> 11:51.752
If you want this Earthling returned alive,

11:51.836 --> 11:55.339
you will forfeit Voltron
to me immediately!

11:55.798 --> 12:00.469
-No. No! We have to get Dad!
-Shiro?

12:01.095 --> 12:03.848
Hold your positions
until the time is right.

12:11.856 --> 12:13.774
Bring the lions, now!

12:13.858 --> 12:15.151
Hmm?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.794
So, the time has come.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.756
This ends today.

13:02.281 --> 13:04.658
We need to get Sam.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.462
Katie!

13:18.380 --> 13:20.341
Pidge, Shiro and Matt are moving in!

13:20.424 --> 13:22.718
Zarkon's fleet's mobilizing as well!

13:22.801 --> 13:26.722
Everyone, get to your lions.
We need to protect our team and get Sam.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.327
We can't let the shuttle dock
with the cruiser!

13:48.410 --> 13:51.789
We need backup. Lance!
We could use a little help down here.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.415
We're already on our way!

14:03.217 --> 14:05.386
Huh?

14:10.724 --> 14:11.559
Hey!

14:12.518 --> 14:14.103
Let my dad go!

14:44.842 --> 14:49.889
You want the throne? Even with the power
of the black bayard, you're too weak.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.974
You'll always be weak.

14:52.391 --> 14:58.564
You have Altean blood running through
your veins, poisoning your very being.

14:58.647 --> 15:03.652
Finally, my darkest shame can be wiped
from the universe forever.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.655
You speak to me of weakness?

15:06.739 --> 15:09.992
You've become nothing more
than one of the witch's monsters.

15:10.075 --> 15:11.994
Does she control you as well?

15:12.786 --> 15:16.665
Tell me, what does it feel like
to grow weaker and weaker?

15:16.749 --> 15:18.959
Does the memory of power haunt you?

15:19.043 --> 15:22.796
Is that why you strive for Voltron
so desperately?

15:23.380 --> 15:24.715
All see it clearly.

15:25.341 --> 15:29.345
Without that lion,
without this bayard, you're nothing.

15:33.015 --> 15:35.559
You want to see my power?

15:37.311 --> 15:41.315
The strength of the empire
flows through my veins,

15:41.398 --> 15:44.818
and you will feel its wrath!

17:00.185 --> 17:01.687
Huh?

17:04.565 --> 17:06.692
Hold on, Dad.

17:09.153 --> 17:11.280
Thanks, Katie.

17:12.573 --> 17:14.575
The ship's gonna crash!

17:16.326 --> 17:18.704
Huh?

17:18.787 --> 17:22.040
Dad, get the controls!

17:24.251 --> 17:27.880
Oh! A little help, guys.

17:30.591 --> 17:31.759
Just a sec.

17:32.468 --> 17:34.011
Kinda busy here, Dad.

17:42.019 --> 17:44.938
- We can't let the Galra get that shuttle!
- Copy that!

19:05.894 --> 19:08.605
- Coran!
- Thought you could use a little help.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.365
- We did it!
- Nice work!

19:18.448 --> 19:22.286
Shiro, Pidge, the sky has been cleared
of all Galra. What's your status?

19:22.870 --> 19:24.955
Shuttle is not clear yet!

19:53.025 --> 19:54.026
Hold on!

20:40.781 --> 20:42.908
Dad!

20:45.661 --> 20:47.120
I missed you so much.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.166
I missed you too, Katie.

21:02.302 --> 21:03.553
The shuttle is clear.

21:10.185 --> 21:13.438
-Nice job, team.
-Where are Lotor and Zarkon?

21:39.214 --> 21:41.508
Your fleet has been destroyed.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.846
It's over.

21:47.014 --> 21:49.933
It's over for you.

22:07.159 --> 22:08.994
No!
