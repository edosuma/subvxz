00:06.440 --> 00:08.800
- You getting the full thing?
- Just about.

00:08.880 --> 00:13.640
Instead of zooming out, pull back.
Get it in context. Just keep going back.

00:13.720 --> 00:15.640
- It's cool.
- It's amazing.

00:15.720 --> 00:20.600
Yes, it is. Mr Bregman? Colonel Tom
Rundell, Cheyenne Mountain Complex.

00:20.680 --> 00:23.760
- Public Affairs Liaison.
- That's a mouthful. Call me Emmett.

00:23.840 --> 00:25.800
- Yes, sir.
- Is that OK?

00:25.880 --> 00:29.680
- This is my posse here...
- Tech Sergeant Dale James.

00:29.760 --> 00:32.080
- Shep Wickenhouse.
- Shep's doing sound.

00:32.159 --> 00:36.720
Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, sir.
But what are you doing here?

00:36.800 --> 00:41.040
We're getting some establishing shots,
the first of many, while we're waiting.

00:41.120 --> 00:43.240
In fact, we should get a shot of you.

00:43.320 --> 00:47.760
Sorry, you're not authorised until
you're briefed by General Hammond.

00:47.840 --> 00:51.560
I've already been briefed - Tom, is it? -
by the Defence Department.

00:51.640 --> 00:55.800
What's the problem? I'm cleared to shoot.
Maybe you guys haven't been cleared.

00:55.880 --> 01:00.000
- What's the problem?
- General Hammond will see you now.

01:00.080 --> 01:01.320
OK.

01:04.400 --> 01:05.960
- This should be fun.
- Oh, yeah.

01:06.040 --> 01:12.000
- General Hammond? This is Mr Bregman.
- I'm very excited to be here, sir.

01:14.240 --> 01:19.680
You may find that we're not all as giddy as
you are about this project, Mr Bregman.

01:19.760 --> 01:21.560
Giddy?

01:23.840 --> 01:27.040
I'm personally and professionally excited,

01:27.120 --> 01:30.120
I think I said excited, to be here, General.

01:30.200 --> 01:33.520
I haven't been giddy since, well,
you don't want to know.

01:33.600 --> 01:36.680
No. I just want to be
as clear as I can up front.

01:36.760 --> 01:39.760
- Sure.
- Your presence is highly unorthodox.

01:39.840 --> 01:44.560
I will not let it threaten the security of
any missions or the safety of my people.

01:44.640 --> 01:51.360
I've already been frisked three times, we
can make it four. Do it if you want. Sorry.

01:51.440 --> 01:55.640
I consider it my responsibility
to protect my people's interests.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.360
Frankly, I feel it's appropriate to warn you

01:58.440 --> 02:02.560
that no one around here wants
to be part of your little reality show.

02:02.640 --> 02:03.720
Oh.

02:03.800 --> 02:06.920
I see. You know, General...

02:07.000 --> 02:12.640
you're probably aware that there were
film cameras on the beaches of Normandy

02:12.720 --> 02:17.080
<i>decades before Survivor debuted on CBS.</i>

02:17.160 --> 02:22.280
I think it's outrageous that the Stargate
programme hasn't been chronicled.

02:22.360 --> 02:26.760
Because it's top secret. Only a handful
of people will see anything you shoot.

02:26.840 --> 02:29.840
So far, General. So far.

02:29.920 --> 02:34.520
Eventually, inevitably, this programme
is gonna be disclosed to the world.

02:34.600 --> 02:37.840
And I think this film we're doing
might in some way provide

02:37.920 --> 02:42.320
insight into what's really been
going on here for the last six years.

02:42.400 --> 02:45.280
What's really been going on?

02:46.640 --> 02:48.560
You know what, General?

02:48.640 --> 02:52.160
I respect what you're doing.
I even respect that you want me out.

02:52.240 --> 02:57.120
But the President of the United States
invited me to do this.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.240
You see that red phone?

03:00.320 --> 03:03.240
You wouldn't be here if he hadn't.

03:04.360 --> 03:10.240
Well, then, I hope I can expect the full
cooperation of you and your personnel.

03:10.320 --> 03:15.400
- To the letter of these orders.
- To the letter. I see. I see. Thank you.

03:15.480 --> 03:18.120
You have high expectations to meet.

03:22.480 --> 03:24.280
General.

03:26.680 --> 03:28.680
<i>(sighs)</i>

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:30.560 --> 04:33.680
Maybe it's just my opinion,
but, to me, throughout history,

04:33.760 --> 04:36.920
the best documentaries
take a cinéma vérité approach.

04:37.000 --> 04:42.440
- Let the subject tell its own story.
- That's a very interesting point of view.

04:42.520 --> 04:45.280
And mostly, if not totally, crap.

04:45.360 --> 04:49.280
Especially in a situation like this.
If this story was gonna tell itself,

04:49.360 --> 04:53.680
there'd be Stargate updates
on the nightly news. You do have a point.

04:53.760 --> 04:57.320
We should make people feel comfortable,
gain their trust.

04:57.400 --> 05:02.520
You know what? We'd be here a year.
These soldiers conceal things for a living.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.880
- Airmen, sir.
- These airmen conceal things for a living.

05:05.960 --> 05:09.840
The only way to get anything
out of them is not by the... Look at that.

05:09.920 --> 05:12.200
..by the cinéma vérité approach.

05:12.280 --> 05:15.800
It's gonna be by
the wringing-it-out-of-them approach.

05:15.880 --> 05:19.680
Look, Mr Bregman. You are here
strictly to document what is going on.

05:19.760 --> 05:23.000
Not to pursue anything prejudicial
to Air Force personnel.

05:23.080 --> 05:25.760
- Call me Emmett.
- If someone were to say something...

05:25.840 --> 05:29.360
- Is that who I think it is?
- It's Colonel Jack O'Neill.

05:29.440 --> 05:31.640
I like vanilla over chocolate,

05:31.720 --> 05:35.000
my favourite colour is peridot,
Tibet should be free,

05:35.080 --> 05:39.320
and if I could have dinner with anyone
in the world it'd be Mary Steenburgen.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.600
- Mary Steenburgen?
- She's nice.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.920
I'm just trying to get a minute with you.

05:44.000 --> 05:47.120
I really don't have time.
I've got a briefing to go to.

05:47.200 --> 05:49.280
I understand. I'm Emmett Br...

05:50.000 --> 05:54.640
No, look. I'm not gonna get a perspective
on this Stargate programme without you.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.960
So, when is a good time for you?

05:57.040 --> 06:00.120
Any time's good. Just send me a memo.

06:01.840 --> 06:03.600
Memo.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.360
Memo.

06:05.880 --> 06:08.920
Really sensed he's starting to trust you.

06:13.800 --> 06:17.440
Don't worry about it.
He only looks unprofessional.

06:17.520 --> 06:22.000
General Hammond warned me people
might be less than enthusiastic about this.

06:22.080 --> 06:25.400
We did have a bad experience
with a TV crew last year.

06:25.480 --> 06:27.800
<i>The Prometheus incident.</i>

06:27.880 --> 06:32.400
I know that the Air Force insisted
on their own crew for that reason.

06:32.480 --> 06:37.240
You might be sensing reluctance from
people to put themselves on a pedestal.

06:37.320 --> 06:39.200
We are just doing our jobs.

06:39.280 --> 06:42.280
Just a job? Consider it my job
to put you on a pedestal.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.680
This job looks to me to be extraordinary,

06:44.760 --> 06:49.200
and, from what I read in your file, the
same can be said about you personally.

06:49.280 --> 06:52.360
- See, now I'm blushing.
- So you are.

06:52.440 --> 06:55.520
Then we should start.
It'll look good on camera.

06:55.600 --> 06:58.800
Let's go, guys. Are you ready?

06:58.880 --> 07:00.680
No.

07:02.000 --> 07:05.520
You don't need a light meter,
the woman is glowing.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.400
Let's get rolling.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.400
- We're rolling.
- Sound?

07:09.480 --> 07:11.080
Rolling.

07:11.160 --> 07:12.600
OK.

07:13.280 --> 07:16.080
Major Samantha Carter. US Air Force.

07:16.160 --> 07:20.000
Astrophysicist. Considered
the foremost expert on the Stargate.

07:20.080 --> 07:24.280
You've explored territory
that no one on Earth has ever seen

07:24.360 --> 07:30.360
and you've fought an enemy
that no one on Earth has even imagined.

07:31.200 --> 07:34.000
Major Samantha Carter.

07:34.080 --> 07:39.080
Meet the six and a half billion people
of the planet Earth.

07:42.520 --> 07:44.120
Hi.

07:45.200 --> 07:48.080
I don't think I've ever asked
this question before,

07:48.160 --> 07:53.680
- but what was it like to be, well, dead?
- I wasn't exactly dead.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.400
You, what's the word, transcended?

07:56.480 --> 07:58.720
Ascended. Yeah.

07:58.800 --> 08:02.880
Well, actually I did have the
unfortunate experience of dying first.

08:02.960 --> 08:06.600
Slowly and quite painfully first,
I might add.

08:06.680 --> 08:10.120
In your file it says "Your human body"...
I'm quoting here.

08:10.200 --> 08:12.560
"Your human body
transformed into energy."

08:12.640 --> 08:16.960
"A bright white light rose above
the hospital bed." Is that...

08:17.040 --> 08:19.760
- Yeah.
- ..accurate? So, could you...

08:19.840 --> 08:24.080
Dr Jackson, could you,
I don't know, elaborate?

08:24.160 --> 08:26.400
<i>- What did it feel like?
- (bleeper)</i>

08:26.480 --> 08:31.120
I don't know. I really don't
remember much after that.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.440
Will you excuse me?

08:33.520 --> 08:35.720
Follow him. Come on, come on.

08:35.799 --> 08:37.480
Move.

08:37.559 --> 08:39.559
Move! Move!

08:43.320 --> 08:45.320
Dr Jackson!

08:46.760 --> 08:48.560
What is it? What is it?

08:48.640 --> 08:51.560
- The mask fragment...
- Sorry, could you slow down?

08:51.640 --> 08:57.360
The mask fragment from P3X-298 was
dated to predynastic Egypt here on Earth.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.120
Could you get a close shot of this?
What is the...

09:00.200 --> 09:03.280
What is the significance of that?

09:03.360 --> 09:05.800
It's fascinating.

09:05.880 --> 09:08.760
It's... OK, you can back up. Back up.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.920
That's it? It's fascinating?

09:13.000 --> 09:15.400
Why were we running?

09:16.280 --> 09:18.160
Oh.

09:18.240 --> 09:21.240
I just wanted to see if you'd chase me.

09:22.160 --> 09:26.560
OK, turn it off. Turn it off.
Get that mike away from me. Turn it off.

09:28.640 --> 09:32.720
Kevlar will not stop the energy blast
from a staff weapon.

09:32.800 --> 09:38.840
The plating in other bulletproof protection
gets superheated from the plasma.

09:38.920 --> 09:42.000
While it would stop the penetration,

09:42.080 --> 09:47.720
the wearer is trapped in what becomes
their own personal microwave oven.

09:47.800 --> 09:53.080
Not a good idea. Anyway,
what we've been working on is this.

09:53.160 --> 09:59.120
A ceramic polymer which will
resist the heat, stop the blast, and...

09:59.200 --> 10:02.840
fits into a standard-issue SG vest.

10:02.920 --> 10:07.320
Which Sergeant Siler
will now demonstrate for us.

10:07.400 --> 10:10.680
Wouldn't it be a better...
No, don't shoot me, shoot him.

10:10.760 --> 10:16.800
Don't you think it would be
more interesting... if I wore the vest?

10:16.880 --> 10:19.360
- No. No, no, no.
- Isn't it safe?

10:19.440 --> 10:21.960
Absolutely.
It's not like we've never done it.

10:22.040 --> 10:24.640
Away from the face, big guy.

10:29.200 --> 10:31.080
It's all good. I'm fine.

10:31.720 --> 10:35.280
You see, um... Yeah.
See, he does that all the time.

10:35.360 --> 10:38.880
The control room is sort of like
the air-traffic control tower.

10:38.960 --> 10:41.320
We monitor all gate activity from here.

10:41.400 --> 10:46.840
<i>(Bregman) So, what are all these blinking
lights about? What are those lights there?</i>

10:46.920 --> 10:52.920
This monitors the power consumption
required to generate outgoing wormholes.

10:54.240 --> 11:00.720
Interestingly, we found our gate draws
10% more wattage than offworld gates.

11:00.800 --> 11:04.600
That far exceeds any potential loss
due to our man-made interface.

11:04.680 --> 11:09.720
We think it's the way the superconductive
crystals inside absorb electrical energy.

11:09.800 --> 11:13.880
But we're also trying to demonstrate
that the DHDs are somehow producing

11:13.960 --> 11:17.280
a purer, more efficient form of power.

11:20.920 --> 11:23.920
Could we get a shot of the gate spinning?

11:24.000 --> 11:27.760
Sure. It's really cool.
Steam comes out of it and everything.

11:27.840 --> 11:30.440
- Great.
- Major.

11:33.440 --> 11:36.160
Sorry, guys. An SG team's
due to embark on a mission.

11:36.240 --> 11:39.640
That's great.
We'll get a shot of them leaving.

11:39.720 --> 11:42.360
Actually, you're gonna have to leave.

11:44.360 --> 11:48.000
Could I ask you something? Are you...
You can stop shooting. Cut.

11:57.400 --> 11:59.960
OK, Balinsky, which way?

12:01.040 --> 12:04.560
- That way.
- I'll take point.

12:04.640 --> 12:08.920
Wells, Bosworth, you're rearguard.
Five-metre spread. Keep your eyes open.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.800
The MALP showed no indication of any
recent Goa'uld activity on this planet.

12:13.880 --> 12:16.800
I don't see any indication
of anything here.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.400
Take the usual bet on that, sir?

12:19.480 --> 12:23.160
- Sure. Wells?
- An abandoned naqahdah mine.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.880
Boring. Good odds. Bosworth?

12:25.960 --> 12:28.040
I'm gonna put my money on trees, sir.

12:28.120 --> 12:32.840
Bosworth's disqualified for being
a smart ass. I'll go with two-headed aliens.

12:32.920 --> 12:35.760
Hostile or friendly, sir?

12:35.840 --> 12:38.200
One head good, one head bad.

12:38.280 --> 12:39.520
Balinsky?

12:39.600 --> 12:41.600
Ruins of an ancient city.

12:41.680 --> 12:44.280
Yeah. You wish.

12:49.080 --> 12:52.200
All night screaming. Projectile vomiting.

12:52.280 --> 12:55.920
Nuclear diapers. You have no idea.

12:56.000 --> 13:00.440
The reason they make 'em so cute is
so you don't suffocate 'em in their sleep.

13:00.520 --> 13:05.440
- Sir, you have four kids.
- Why do you think I enjoy work so much?

13:06.520 --> 13:10.680
Don't get me wrong. I love the little
buggers to death, but trust me...

13:10.760 --> 13:16.760
it makes going through a Stargate and
facing alien bad guys look like nothing.

13:18.000 --> 13:21.560
- This is relaxing.
- Then why'd you have four?

13:23.560 --> 13:26.640
One's pretty bad. But you figure...

13:26.720 --> 13:31.360
you gotta have two so the little guy
can have a brother or sister, right?

13:31.440 --> 13:34.840
Then you have two boys,
and the wife says she wants a girl.

13:34.920 --> 13:38.720
You figure, hell, three can't be
much worse than two, right?

13:38.800 --> 13:42.920
What you don't realise is
your brain is fried cos you haven't slept.

13:43.000 --> 13:46.280
After three, four is no big deal.
You're so deep in.

13:46.360 --> 13:49.480
Nothing seems to matter any more.
It's chaos.

13:49.560 --> 13:54.000
You're just trying to make it through
each day alive. And in the end...

13:54.080 --> 13:57.960
you spend all the energy you have left
trying to get 'em into bed.

13:58.040 --> 14:03.440
Only to lie awake,
praying they don't get hooked on drugs.

14:04.360 --> 14:09.160
Or hurt. Or worse,
wind up dead in an alley somewhere.

14:09.760 --> 14:14.160
- I can't wait, sir.
- Miracle of birth, my ass.

14:14.240 --> 14:19.200
I'll tell you what a miracle is.
Birth control that works.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.440
Well, I'll be damned.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.400
I win.

14:41.680 --> 14:42.880
Sir.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.440
Did you do your interview yet?

14:45.520 --> 14:47.440
Yeah.

14:47.520 --> 14:49.960
Mary Steenburgen?

14:50.040 --> 14:52.040
She's so hot.

14:52.880 --> 14:56.040
Can you tell me the reason
for this documentary again?

14:56.120 --> 15:01.840
Didn't you read the memo? Officially, it's
for the 1,000th trip through the Stargate,

15:01.920 --> 15:04.920
- but I think there's more to it.
- One thousand?

15:05.000 --> 15:08.080
I know. Hard to believe
we've been at it this long.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.680
There should be a cake.

15:10.760 --> 15:12.760
Wait, um...

15:12.840 --> 15:14.720
Dr Jackson, I just gotta...

15:14.800 --> 15:19.920
"Your memory was erased
when you returned to..."

15:20.000 --> 15:22.040
I'm quoting here.

15:22.120 --> 15:24.200
.."human form".

15:24.280 --> 15:28.920
That sounds completely idiotic.
Make a note, I have to reask that question.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.840
Sorry. Could you...?
What can you tell us about all that?

15:32.920 --> 15:35.200
Not much.

15:36.520 --> 15:42.920
OK. Well, can you tell us a little bit
about what things were like before that?

15:43.000 --> 15:48.160
Thankfully I have most of those memories
back. There are still a few holes.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.040
OK.

15:52.240 --> 15:57.520
"The pharaohs of the fourth dynasty
did not build the pyramids."

15:57.600 --> 16:00.960
No, they didn't. They're landing pads
for Goa'uld motherships.

16:01.040 --> 16:04.840
I'm quoting from a speech you made
before your introduction to the Stargate.

16:04.920 --> 16:09.880
I presume that you knew nothing about
landing platforms or motherships, right?

16:09.960 --> 16:13.760
- Right. No.
- Until you met Catherine Langford.

16:13.840 --> 16:17.720
- Right.
- And she introduced you to the Stargate.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.680
Right.

16:20.560 --> 16:22.160
So.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.000
Why?

16:25.080 --> 16:27.080
Why what?

16:30.040 --> 16:33.920
- Why did she do that?
- I don't know. You'd have to ask her.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.360
OK, maybe I'll ask her.
Where is she? Is she transcended?

16:40.440 --> 16:45.320
- Or ascended, or something like that?
- No, retired, actually. But...

16:45.400 --> 16:47.400
you never know.

16:51.320 --> 16:54.120
So I'm just reading your file here.

16:54.200 --> 16:59.600
It's fascinating. I should ask you
immediately here... You're an alien?

17:00.480 --> 17:04.680
I mean, well, not to you.
To us, you would be...

17:04.760 --> 17:11.720
Anyway, you were the highest-ranking
officer in the service of our alien enemies.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.200
And you turned against them.

17:15.119 --> 17:18.119
Why did you turn against them
when you did?

17:27.839 --> 17:32.200
I mean, why are you sitting there if you
don't intend to answer my questions?

17:32.280 --> 17:35.080
Because I was requested to
by General Hammond.

17:35.160 --> 17:40.240
I see. And he didn't happen to mention
to you that part of the interview process

17:40.320 --> 17:43.840
involved actually saying something?

17:44.360 --> 17:45.440
No.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.400
OK. Um...

17:50.480 --> 17:54.240
All right, let's try this.
Colonel Jack O'Neill.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.360
You must have a tremendous
amount of respect for him.

17:58.440 --> 18:01.600
Or maybe you don't. Let me rephrase.

18:01.680 --> 18:05.080
Colonel Jack O'Neill
is your immediate superior.

18:06.120 --> 18:09.720
OK, maybe not in terms of species, but...

18:09.800 --> 18:12.520
- He's your commanding officer.
- Indeed.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.160
Good! OK, good. Good.

18:15.240 --> 18:19.040
Terrific. Is there anything
you can tell us about him?

18:19.120 --> 18:24.720
If you wish to learn of Colonel O'Neill,
you should interview Colonel O'Neill.

18:24.800 --> 18:29.440
OK. Thanks. That's a good idea. Let me
ask you this... Where are you going?

18:36.360 --> 18:38.080
How long?

18:38.160 --> 18:42.680
- I don't know. Why? We just got here.
- An hour ago.

18:42.760 --> 18:45.920
I need more time.
Look at this place, it's incredible.

18:46.680 --> 18:49.400
- You've seen one crumbled city...
- Sir.

18:49.480 --> 18:53.640
- This place was built by the Ancients.
- Are you sure?

18:53.720 --> 18:57.800
Yes. These markings,
and this stone architecture...

18:57.880 --> 19:00.240
Dr Jackson is gonna die
when he sees this.

19:00.320 --> 19:02.040
What, again?

19:02.120 --> 19:03.920
Funny.

19:10.920 --> 19:12.480
Don't go far.

19:15.440 --> 19:18.360
- It looks like an alien.
- Shut up.

19:19.360 --> 19:23.800
- Remember that thing on P2X-787?
- Get lost.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.960
See, that thing was
easy on the eyes by comparison.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.040
Let me see.

19:31.320 --> 19:34.840
- That's pretty scary, Wells.
- It's my unborn son, sir.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.320
How can you tell?

19:38.200 --> 19:42.200
I don't know, Wells.
I wouldn't paint the room blue just yet.

19:43.160 --> 19:45.320
Take cover!

20:13.160 --> 20:15.200
Colonel, now!

20:23.080 --> 20:25.080
Hold!

20:45.880 --> 20:47.880
What the hell is it?

20:48.880 --> 20:52.240
Like the people who are now
serving here at the SGC,

20:52.320 --> 20:56.560
the youth of tomorrow will one day
have to defend the free spirit of mankind.

20:56.640 --> 21:02.680
And not just on our fair planet,
but out there. Through the Stargate.

21:02.760 --> 21:05.360
In the vastness of the galaxy,

21:05.440 --> 21:11.000
where untold evil with powers...
we've never seen before

21:11.080 --> 21:14.960
are still waiting... to prey upon us.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.880
OK. Cut.

21:21.680 --> 21:23.960
Senator. Great.

21:24.040 --> 21:28.240
Thank you so much for doing this.
It was really terrific.

21:28.320 --> 21:32.240
- These people deserve it.
- We're trying our best. Listen, Senator...

21:32.320 --> 21:35.720
I hope you don't mind
me saying this, but...

21:36.840 --> 21:41.000
It sounded a bit like a speech.
I don't think you're gonna like the results.

21:41.080 --> 21:46.520
What if we do it off-the-cuff and I throw
things at you and see how you respond?

21:46.600 --> 21:48.440
No.

21:48.520 --> 21:50.160
- No?
- No.

21:50.800 --> 21:56.200
- If you want anything else from me...
- Yes, actually, Senator...

22:00.960 --> 22:03.560
Colonel. As I'm sure you know,

22:03.640 --> 22:06.840
I'm to be part of the piece
these men are putting together

22:06.920 --> 22:11.400
to document the fine work
you're doing here at the SGC.

22:12.280 --> 22:16.120
<i>- No, I didn't know that.
- (laughs) Well, I'm...</i>

22:16.200 --> 22:19.000
I'm sure there was a memo.

22:22.880 --> 22:26.320
Did you tell them about the time
you tried to shut this place?

22:26.400 --> 22:30.920
- Or the time you had Hammond by the...
- I suggest you watch what you say.

22:31.000 --> 22:35.320
- Slander is a serious offence.
- Yes. So I hear.

22:36.800 --> 22:41.040
I have always been
a strong supporter of this programme.

22:41.120 --> 22:43.920
I admit I was critical in the past,
but only because of

22:44.000 --> 22:48.800
the unrealised potential
I see this operation as having.

22:50.560 --> 22:53.200
How did your interview go, Colonel?

22:53.280 --> 22:55.440
It was short.

22:55.520 --> 22:57.520
Yet oh, so sweet.

22:58.040 --> 23:00.880
<i>(Kinsey) The president
wants you to play ball on this.</i>

23:00.960 --> 23:06.920
I hope you're not intending
to disappoint our Commander in Chief.

23:07.000 --> 23:12.880
I would think you would want to show
your appreciation for his backing.

23:12.960 --> 23:18.840
What are you doing here? Last time l
checked, you were trying to discredit him.

23:18.920 --> 23:21.000
His term is up.

23:21.080 --> 23:26.440
My running mate and I are merely
pointing out to the American people

23:26.520 --> 23:29.880
certain areas that we think
we can do a better job in.

23:29.960 --> 23:32.760
And when that time comes...

23:33.880 --> 23:37.480
I know we can count
on your vote, Colonel.

23:37.560 --> 23:40.160
Yeah. That'll happen.

23:41.840 --> 23:44.240
And I want you to know this.

23:44.320 --> 23:50.560
If elected, this programme
can count on our full support.

23:53.400 --> 23:55.880
- You want to get this?
- Sure.

23:59.040 --> 24:02.360
You smarmy,
self-righteous, opportunistic...

24:02.440 --> 24:04.560
<i>- (alarm)
- Unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

24:04.640 --> 24:09.880
<i>Colonel O'Neill to the control room.
Repeat, unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

24:11.280 --> 24:13.880
Duty calls.

24:13.960 --> 24:17.960
- I was done.
- Colonel, what is this offworld activation?

24:18.040 --> 24:21.160
- I won't know until I get there.
- Great. Where's there?

24:21.240 --> 24:23.840
There is here for you.

24:23.920 --> 24:26.280
Ongoing activity.

24:27.320 --> 24:30.480
<i>Balinsky wants to stay, sir.</i>

24:30.560 --> 24:33.200
You see anything else worth staying for?

24:33.280 --> 24:37.280
<i>- Hard to say.
- We need to finish searching these ruins.</i>

24:37.360 --> 24:41.360
<i>- How long?
- A day or two, maybe more.</i>

24:41.800 --> 24:44.840
Be nice to send up a UAV,
get an aerial overview.

24:44.920 --> 24:48.520
Permission to remain granted.
I'll send SG-3 as backup.

24:48.600 --> 24:52.200
<i>- Any further threats, get out immediately.
- Understood, sir.</i>

24:52.280 --> 24:57.240
In the meantime I can run some tests on
the device. See what it's been doing there.

24:57.320 --> 24:59.720
Send the device back,
report in on the hour.

24:59.800 --> 25:02.840
<i>Yes, sir. SG-13 out.</i>

25:02.920 --> 25:04.720
Sir.

25:06.880 --> 25:10.600
- It's not that I don't appreciate...
- I knew they were headed your way.

25:10.680 --> 25:14.040
I thought you might be looking
for an excuse to get away.

25:14.120 --> 25:20.480
I thought as much, sir. And I just wanted
to express my deep and unyielding...

25:20.560 --> 25:22.880
..love for you, sir.

25:22.960 --> 25:26.960
General? If you have a moment,
Mr Bregman would like a word.

25:30.280 --> 25:34.880
"Exempt from clearance are all current
activities not reviewed by this office."

25:34.960 --> 25:37.320
That being the Pentagon.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.680
- Breathing is a current activity.
- My interpretation is:

25:40.760 --> 25:45.880
You are not authorised to know about
the most recent unscheduled activation.

25:45.960 --> 25:49.040
General, I need a little leeway.

25:49.120 --> 25:54.560
I said I was going to hold you to the letter
of these orders, Mr Bregman. Give it up.

26:00.080 --> 26:03.880
- You know, Colonel O'Neill...
- Is currently unavailable.

26:03.960 --> 26:08.800
The president has given me his
full support. Why are you resisting?

26:08.880 --> 26:11.600
I'm not resisting. I'm following orders.

26:11.680 --> 26:16.960
My opinion is that I don't think my people
need to be put under a microscope.

26:17.040 --> 26:19.680
Cameras don't just record things.

26:19.760 --> 26:23.280
They change what they record
simply by being there.

26:23.360 --> 26:26.960
The work these people do
is hard enough without them feeling

26:27.040 --> 26:30.840
that every breath they take
is being preserved for judgment.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.200
- Maybe it should be.
- Excuse me?

26:33.280 --> 26:35.640
I said maybe it should be.

26:35.720 --> 26:40.200
The Pentagon has allowed journalists
to be embedded with the forces before.

26:40.280 --> 26:45.040
Under fire, under pressure. So that
what's seen and what's heard is the truth.

26:45.120 --> 26:48.800
- I think we're through.
- I don't. I don't disagree...

26:48.880 --> 26:51.400
<i>- (phone rings)
- Excuse me.</i>

27:03.480 --> 27:07.320
- You ever seen anything like this?
- I have not.

27:07.400 --> 27:12.680
Definitely a remote probe of some kind.
The capacity of the memory is immense.

27:12.760 --> 27:17.080
But so far, all I've found
are detailed images of the ruins.

27:17.160 --> 27:21.320
You know, it makes sense. We use
a MALP, why wouldn't the Goa'uld?

27:21.400 --> 27:27.680
The Goa'uld are scavengers. It is quite
possible they got the idea from us.

27:27.760 --> 27:31.120
So, you do your interview
with the documentary crew yet?

27:31.200 --> 27:32.440
Indeed.

27:32.520 --> 27:35.480
I can't wait to hear
what everyone else said.

27:35.560 --> 27:38.120
I did not say much.

27:38.200 --> 27:42.640
Really? That is surprising.
It's usually so hard to shut you up.

27:44.280 --> 27:47.440
I found the entire experience unpleasant.

27:47.520 --> 27:52.200
- They want to talk to me again.
- Did your interview not go well either?

27:52.280 --> 27:56.920
I thought it was fine,
but apparently I looked nervous.

28:04.040 --> 28:08.320
What is the meaning of
"offworld activation"? What is that about?

28:08.400 --> 28:11.400
- I'm not...
- You wouldn't tell me even if you knew.

28:11.480 --> 28:15.520
You remind me of the minders in the Gulf
that used to censor our reports.

28:15.600 --> 28:18.720
It's not as if we're conspiring
to cover up the truth.

28:18.800 --> 28:21.120
Censoring reports in combat
makes sense.

28:21.200 --> 28:25.440
You should not jeopardise troops
involved in ongoing missions.

28:25.520 --> 28:31.040
This isn't the news. Are you broadcasting
this to the enemy on some other planet?

28:31.120 --> 28:34.800
Look, I have been denied access
to several prior mission files

28:34.880 --> 28:38.120
cos no one wants me to know
how close we've come to...

28:38.200 --> 28:40.920
You're not conspiring.
Why don't you tell me?

28:41.000 --> 28:44.080
- We've come close to what?
- Being compromised.

28:44.160 --> 28:46.640
Being compromised.
There's a euphemism.

28:46.720 --> 28:50.520
Close to the brink of
planetary annihilation is more accurate.

28:50.600 --> 28:52.920
That's why we're not allowed to film.

28:53.000 --> 28:56.520
Every time they open that gate,
something could go wrong.

28:56.600 --> 29:02.240
In which case, it wouldn't really matter
what we had on tape, would it?

29:02.320 --> 29:04.800
What did you say?

29:05.800 --> 29:07.920
What did you say? "It doesn't matter"?

29:08.000 --> 29:12.880
If you had any integrity at all, you would
resign before I had to replace you.

29:12.960 --> 29:16.640
I'd rather be replaced
than court-martialled.

29:16.720 --> 29:22.000
The bottom line is, the SGC is not gonna
let any of this out until it's declassified.

29:22.080 --> 29:24.880
- Why not shoot it and decide later?
- It's not up to me.

29:24.960 --> 29:27.680
"Not up to me." "Not up to me."

29:27.760 --> 29:31.080
Colonel. Colonel.
We're all set up for you right here.

29:31.160 --> 29:33.480
- Briefing.
- Colonel. Colonel.

29:33.560 --> 29:36.920
Colonel! You know, I'm gonna get you
on camera sooner or later.

29:37.000 --> 29:41.080
Even if all I get is a series of shots
of you avoiding being got.

29:41.160 --> 29:45.360
Fire away.
I hope shots of my ass serve you well.

29:50.320 --> 29:53.720
All right, pack up.
What are we doing here?

29:54.960 --> 29:58.440
How do you feel about Colonel O'Neill?

29:59.520 --> 30:01.720
He's an amazing man.

30:01.800 --> 30:06.880
After everything he's done, he's still
modest. Quite self-effacing, actually.

30:06.960 --> 30:10.960
He even likes people to think
he's not as smart as he really is.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.520
Bottom line:
he's an incredibly strong leader

30:13.600 --> 30:18.480
who's given more of himself for this
programme than any man has given for...

30:18.560 --> 30:21.520
well, anything I can imagine.

30:22.320 --> 30:25.920
Do you spend a lot of time
together outside of work?

30:26.000 --> 30:28.120
We don't get much time outside of work.

30:28.200 --> 30:32.200
And when we do,
our personal interests are a little different.

30:32.280 --> 30:36.520
Did you ever hear the expression
"opposites attract"?

30:36.600 --> 30:39.200
We have a very professional relationship.

30:39.280 --> 30:43.120
Really? Professional?
After everything you've been through?

30:43.200 --> 30:47.760
You must have, maybe it's not
too much to say, faced death together?

30:47.840 --> 30:54.080
Yeah. Not unlike countless military
personnel throughout the years.

30:54.160 --> 30:59.720
I won't deny there's a bond between us.
Daniel and Teal'c are also like family.

30:59.800 --> 31:03.880
Colonel O'Neill is first and foremost
my superior officer.

31:03.960 --> 31:08.960
Even if there was potential for something
more, and I'm not saying that there is,

31:09.040 --> 31:15.000
our military positions and the very
nature of our job wouldn't allow for it.

31:16.280 --> 31:20.720
Well, basically,
when the gate is dialling, I say:

31:20.800 --> 31:24.120
"Chevron one encoded,
chevron two encoded"

31:24.200 --> 31:28.160
and so on incrementally,
up to the seventh chevron,

31:28.240 --> 31:34.280
which is a little different because
that's when the wormhole connects.

31:34.360 --> 31:38.960
When that happens, I like to
change things up a bit and just say:

31:39.040 --> 31:41.720
"Chevron seven locked."

31:42.440 --> 31:44.760
Locked. That's great.

31:44.840 --> 31:48.200
That's good. Anything else?

31:48.280 --> 31:51.520
Oh, yeah. I'm responsible for this.

31:53.000 --> 31:54.880
Close the iris.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.640
Open the iris.

32:05.080 --> 32:07.640
That's pretty much my job, right there.

32:08.600 --> 32:10.880
- That's it?
- Pretty much.

32:11.320 --> 32:14.680
- I think you're being a little modest.
- Oh, I mean...

32:14.760 --> 32:16.920
Don't get me wrong.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.880
It's really rewarding. It really is.

32:19.960 --> 32:23.440
And we have tried
various automated scenarios,

32:23.520 --> 32:30.080
but the SG teams agree that when they
send the iris code through the wormhole,

32:30.160 --> 32:34.800
they like to know that
there's a real person on the other end.

32:34.880 --> 32:37.960
Someone that they can trust to get it right.

32:40.000 --> 32:44.520
That gives me
and the other gate technicians

32:44.600 --> 32:47.680
a great sense of pride.

32:47.760 --> 32:50.560
Sure. That's good.

33:01.800 --> 33:04.840
- Dr Jackson. Hi.
- Hey, how's it going?

33:04.920 --> 33:08.400
You're packing. Going off...
Sorry, I forgot the expression.

33:08.480 --> 33:11.520
- Offworld.
- Offworld. Is that it? So, you're going?

33:11.600 --> 33:14.120
No, no. Just going through my pack.

33:14.200 --> 33:19.720
That's the camera you use, though, right?
I've seen hours and hours of your footage.

33:19.800 --> 33:23.880
- Inscriptions and ruins and artefacts.
- Cool, huh?

33:24.920 --> 33:26.440
I wonder...

33:26.520 --> 33:31.240
If you get the opportunity, maybe you
could point your camera at some action?

33:31.320 --> 33:33.080
Just for a change?

33:33.160 --> 33:36.520
See, when there is action,
I'm too busy to be pointing a camera.

33:36.600 --> 33:39.920
I'm running, shooting,
translating what the bad guys are saying.

33:40.000 --> 33:45.840
It's just that I've heard a lot about these
amazing events. But my medium is visual.

33:45.920 --> 33:48.600
I can't tell the story unless I have pictures.

33:48.680 --> 33:52.320
I'm not suggesting you put
anybody in danger, not yourself,

33:52.400 --> 33:55.080
but if the opportunity arises,

33:55.160 --> 33:59.160
take a second and just
point your lens at something that moves.

33:59.240 --> 34:04.000
All right. Well, I'm not scheduled to go on
a mission offworld for a couple of days.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.080
- If it's there, shoot it.
- Right.

34:06.160 --> 34:10.880
Just not the inscriptions all the time.
Some action would be good.

34:16.400 --> 34:18.760
- Hey.
- Hey. One second.

34:21.760 --> 34:23.840
You want me to translate something?

34:23.920 --> 34:29.560
I'm trying to get the interface connection
stable. SG-13 kicked the crap out of it.

34:29.639 --> 34:33.040
Its system log seems to be isolated
on a separate crystal.

34:33.120 --> 34:39.120
Bregman had the nerve to suggest that
all that archive video footage was boring.

34:41.000 --> 34:45.639
OK. Here's what really bugs me. He's only
here cos this president is on his way out.

34:45.719 --> 34:49.040
He doesn't want to look bad
if and when the programme goes public.

34:49.120 --> 34:51.480
This is all about political posturing.

34:51.560 --> 34:54.040
Man, he really grilled me on that.

34:54.120 --> 34:57.120
About the programme going public?
What did you say?

34:57.200 --> 35:00.360
- Babbled incoherently.
- Could you imagine if it did?

35:00.440 --> 35:03.040
I try not to think about it.

35:09.320 --> 35:10.920
There.

35:11.920 --> 35:16.720
- It's mostly just technical stuff.
- Anything jump out at you?

35:16.800 --> 35:20.360
Well, here's where it encountered SG-13.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.960
- Uh-oh.
- What are "Uh-oh"?

35:24.040 --> 35:30.200
After it engaged shields and weapons
it activated a long-range communicator.

35:30.280 --> 35:31.760
Colonel Dixon.

35:31.840 --> 35:36.560
We believe the Goa'uld probe sent out
a transmission prior to your disabling it.

35:36.640 --> 35:39.600
I'm ordering you to return immediately.

35:39.680 --> 35:44.920
Roger that, sir. Estimated arrival time
15 minutes. Dixon out.

35:45.920 --> 35:49.000
Pack it up, Doctor. We're going home.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.840
- Wells, Bosworth.
- Wells here.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.000
Bring it home. We're booking out.

35:57.080 --> 36:00.560
- Roger that. Wells out.
- It's about time.

36:04.440 --> 36:07.120
Taking fire! Wells has been hit.

36:08.200 --> 36:12.400
Get to the gate.
SG niner, requesting assistance.

36:13.960 --> 36:21.120
OK. Three gunshot wounds, four
staff-weapon burns, severe hypothermia.

36:21.200 --> 36:27.120
I'm quite surprised he's actually
authorised me to discuss all this.

36:27.200 --> 36:30.080
Nanite technology artificially aged him.

36:30.160 --> 36:33.960
He had his shoulder punctured
by an alien time capsule device.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.520
Three knee operations.

36:38.600 --> 36:43.040
That's the whole Hathor incident
which he's asked me never to discuss.

36:43.120 --> 36:48.600
Oh, this was a good one. Last year he was
exposed to an ancient incurable disease.

36:48.680 --> 36:51.480
Obviously not incurable, right? Or...

36:51.560 --> 36:56.640
Well, there was a Tok'ra symbiote in need
of a temporary host. That did the trick.

36:56.720 --> 37:02.120
I don't understand what you just said, but
it's amazing that Colonel O'Neill is alive.

37:02.200 --> 37:07.080
Yeah, I never know what's next. You just
try and keep your head on straight.

37:07.160 --> 37:11.000
We also set a lot of broken bones
and prescribe a ton of antibiotics.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.920
Well, still, it sometimes
must be overwhelming.

37:14.000 --> 37:18.240
Yeah. It's funny. All the training,
everything we know about medicine...

37:18.320 --> 37:23.720
It amounts to very little. Often I face
situations where there's nothing I can do.

37:23.800 --> 37:27.280
- Is there an upside?
- Are you kidding me?

37:27.360 --> 37:32.320
We all persevere because we feel we're on
the brink of understanding so much more.

37:32.400 --> 37:35.200
And not just about medicine,
but about who we are.

37:35.280 --> 37:38.280
Where we came from,
what the future has in store,

37:38.360 --> 37:41.080
how we fit into
the grand scheme of things.

37:41.160 --> 37:46.480
<i>(PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.
Repeat, unscheduled offworld activation.</i>

37:46.560 --> 37:51.040
- We've heard that before. Is that unusual?
- No, it happens from time to time.

37:51.120 --> 37:55.080
- What does it mean?
- Your guess is as good as mine.

37:55.160 --> 37:57.680
- You got that announcement?
- Yeah, we're good.

37:57.760 --> 38:00.360
OK, good. Well, thank you, Dr Fraiser.

38:00.440 --> 38:05.800
Guys, why don't you go roll some
cutaways and get some sound bites.

38:05.880 --> 38:09.760
- So this...
- Yeah, we're good. Thank you.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.080
Uh, anything you can. OK?

38:13.160 --> 38:15.160
- Sorry.
- Ow. Ow.

38:17.280 --> 38:20.000
I'm glad the Pentagon sent you. Just...

38:20.080 --> 38:21.960
Go away.

38:22.880 --> 38:28.920
Listen, I was just wondering. It seems
like the unpredictable happens here a lot.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.400
- Yes. Pretty much.
- Yeah.

38:32.320 --> 38:36.280
- You're not needed for this thing?
- If I am, they know where to find me.

38:36.360 --> 38:40.480
I was thinking of getting something
to eat in the café. I'm not sure where...

38:40.560 --> 38:42.400
- That way.
- I was wondering...

38:42.480 --> 38:45.800
If I'd like to join you. OK, yeah.

38:45.880 --> 38:48.600
- What are you doing?
- I'm just white balancing.

38:48.680 --> 38:52.280
Well, go balance the white
somewhere else, OK?

38:52.360 --> 38:56.880
<i>- Somewhere else.
- (Fraiser) I'm gonna dump these first.</i>

38:57.960 --> 39:02.560
- Wells is alive, but he's hurt badly.
- How many Jaffa? Five? Ten? A hundred?

39:02.640 --> 39:06.200
Colonel Dixon counted six.
They were able to fend them off.

39:06.280 --> 39:09.840
- Did the Jaffa come through the gate?
- No, SG-3 was covering it.

39:09.920 --> 39:12.520
- The gate's clear?
- SG-3 was there when I left.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.200
- Take SG-5 and 7 and Dr Fraiser.
- Thank you.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.760
- Colonel.
- Yes, sir.

39:16.840 --> 39:19.880
It sounds like an ambush.
But there's nothing else we can do.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.840
Right. Go.

39:30.120 --> 39:32.760
Oh. Sorry. I was just...

39:32.840 --> 39:39.680
I was just thinking that you have
a very natural quality. I mean, on camera.

39:39.760 --> 39:41.920
You let me film...

39:42.000 --> 39:47.680
You allow people to see
grace under pressure.

39:49.880 --> 39:52.960
Are you flirting with me?

39:53.040 --> 39:59.040
Ah, well... See, I, on the other hand,
am very clumsy under pressure.

40:00.080 --> 40:01.760
I've seen worse.

40:02.240 --> 40:04.760
So, um... What's with the ring?

40:06.040 --> 40:07.360
Oh, just...

40:07.440 --> 40:11.200
It's sentimental.
My wife died a few years ago.

40:11.280 --> 40:14.200
So how do any of you
have a personal life?

40:14.280 --> 40:17.960
We don't. I spend most of my time
outside work with my daughter.

40:18.040 --> 40:20.120
- Oh. So you're married.
- No.

40:20.200 --> 40:23.080
- No, she's adopted.
- Oh.

40:23.560 --> 40:26.440
She's from another planet.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.200
OK.

40:30.280 --> 40:34.000
Um... would you be willing
to talk about that on camera?

40:34.080 --> 40:36.440
<i>- I'd rather...
- (man) Excuse me, ma'am.</i>

40:36.520 --> 40:39.720
- You're required in the ready room.
- Thank you.

40:40.160 --> 40:42.280
- Sorry.
- That's OK.

40:49.400 --> 40:51.400
Let's go, gentlemen.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.640
All because I wanted an aerial survey.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.760
Took me too long to figure out
it sent a transmission.

40:58.840 --> 41:01.560
None of that matters now.
