05:18.039 --> 05:20.497
My name is Lisa Nolan, Garda Lisa Nolan.

05:21.788 --> 05:24.830

05:26.913 --> 05:28.955
You getting in or what?

05:29.038 --> 05:32.412
- I have a bag.
- Put it in the boot.

05:51.078 --> 05:54.410
- Would you like a mint?
- Hmm?

05:54.493 --> 05:57.827
No, thanks. They give me a heartburn.

07:16.278 --> 07:19.277
Garda Nolan. 'Tis lovely to have you.

07:19.402 --> 07:21.317
- Lovely to be here.
- Lovely to have you.

07:21.318 --> 07:22.235
Oh... coffee.

07:22.319 --> 07:25.944
Oh, that'll be great,
thank you. Here you go.

07:30.276 --> 07:31.046
So...

07:31.947 --> 07:34.109
- What do you think of the place?
- It's gorgeous, isn't it?

07:34.151 --> 07:37.818
- It is, indeed. 'Tis, indeed.
- Quiet as shite.

07:37.843 --> 07:41.233
- Milk?
- What kind?

07:41.317 --> 07:45.483
- Cow's.
- I'll just take a black, thanks.

07:45.567 --> 07:48.608
So, you are gonna have
my desk, when I'm gone.

07:48.692 --> 07:52.028
O'Shea here will tell you, with half the
island leaving for the show on Dungary,

07:52.029 --> 07:53.316
it'll be dead this weekend.

07:53.399 --> 07:56.066
- I'm sure I'll find something to do.
- Sure you will.

07:56.149 --> 07:58.899
- Here you go now.
- Thanks.

08:03.815 --> 08:07.148
- She really necessary?
- Do tell me, boy.

08:07.231 --> 08:10.231
You are only gone two weeks.
I can handle two weeks.

08:10.315 --> 08:12.065
You could, but you wouldn't!

08:29.354 --> 08:31.469
Tadhg, take a look at this.

08:34.470 --> 08:35.687
It's a big 'un.

08:35.770 --> 08:39.437
- That's not a lobster.
- Then what is it?

08:42.937 --> 08:47.852
Feck! You bastard, you! Paddy!
You knew it was going to do that.

08:47.936 --> 08:49.786
I didn't, on me life.

08:49.787 --> 08:52.686
Ugh! The smell!

08:52.769 --> 08:55.935
- What is it?
- 'Tis no fekkin' lobster!

09:11.725 --> 09:14.934
I had some holidays saved,
that needed to be taken, and...

09:15.017 --> 09:18.058
this posting came up and I just thought,
you know, "What harm? Why not?"

09:18.141 --> 09:20.722
Can't hurt with the
Review Board, you know.

09:20.723 --> 09:22.349
Ah... the old Review Board.

09:23.433 --> 09:25.474
- Where are you stationed?
- Dublin Central.

09:25.558 --> 09:28.140
- How's that working out for you?
- Oh, it's great.

09:28.223 --> 09:31.723
We've got our drugs, muggings,
murders and rapes. Always on the go.

09:31.807 --> 09:36.057
Oh, it's exciting. You can relax,
there's none of that here.

09:36.140 --> 09:40.181
You never know. It's always the quiet
places where the mad shit happens.

09:40.264 --> 09:42.514
Just open a paper.

09:52.471 --> 09:56.263
In all my years, I've never
seen anything like it.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.846
Lisa Nolan. Jim Gleeson, local doctor.

09:58.930 --> 10:02.512
- Hello, love, how are you?
- Grand, thanks.

10:02.595 --> 10:04.726
Wouldn't have any aspirin
on you, would you, Jim?

10:04.727 --> 10:08.012
I have a couple of wine gums.
Would you like a wine gum?

10:08.095 --> 10:12.094
- All right.
- Look who's here.

10:13.219 --> 10:15.678
I'd prefer it if you'd
introduced me as 'Garda Nolan'.

10:15.761 --> 10:18.094
- Nobody minds.
- I do.

10:18.178 --> 10:22.135
- What happened?
- Yeah... one second.

10:31.093 --> 10:33.926
- Smith.
- Lisa.

10:35.926 --> 10:36.626
- Hi.
- Hi.

10:36.627 --> 10:39.092
Smith's a marine psychologist
or something.

10:39.176 --> 10:43.301
- Did I get that right?
- No, it's marine ecology.

10:43.384 --> 10:46.729
Will you hold this a second?
So, how long are you here for?

10:46.730 --> 10:47.979
I'm here two weeks.

10:47.980 --> 10:52.010
Oh, wonderful. Whereabouts you staying?

10:52.011 --> 10:55.130
So... they are dead.

10:55.914 --> 11:00.090
Dead? Oh, no. They are just sleeping.

11:04.299 --> 11:06.214
- So, what happened?
- Well...

11:08.964 --> 11:10.958
They are pilot whales.

11:12.059 --> 11:16.047
It happens with them from time to time,
but no one really knows why.

11:16.130 --> 11:18.047
And what are all these deep cuts?

11:18.130 --> 11:20.922
Possible wounds from the rocks,
while being washed up here.

11:21.005 --> 11:26.671
- They didn't beach themselves?
- Oh, no. They died at sea.

11:26.754 --> 11:30.004
All of them? At once?

11:30.187 --> 11:36.171
- Yeah, it's a strange one all right.
- Yeah.

11:36.254 --> 11:37.505
- Squeamish?
- No.

11:37.506 --> 11:38.911
- No?
- No.

11:38.995 --> 11:40.545
Good to know.
Okay, there's an orifice...

11:50.710 --> 11:51.697
What's that?

11:51.698 --> 11:53.752
- What is that?
- That.

11:53.835 --> 11:55.627
It's a hand in a claw position?

11:55.710 --> 11:58.544
It's a dead one of those.

12:01.001 --> 12:03.084
That's global, isn't it?

12:03.168 --> 12:05.709
- I don't get it.
- You don't get it?

12:05.793 --> 12:08.001
- No.
- What's not to get?

12:08.084 --> 12:10.833
"What's that? It's a dead one of those"

12:12.125 --> 12:13.875
No.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.292
Don't get it.

12:40.415 --> 12:42.617
You there, what's your name?

12:42.618 --> 12:44.705
Chemisov Wlodzimierz Voychehovski.

12:48.414 --> 12:50.997
Carry on.

12:56.829 --> 13:00.163
Hey, Daly! Where is Cooney?

13:02.204 --> 13:06.537
Put that cigarette out, or I go down and
use your top of your knob as an ashtray.

13:39.042 --> 13:39.772
You busy?

13:39.773 --> 13:42.659
Not at all. Just strip
'em down, and I take 'em.

13:42.742 --> 13:46.075
- Where's the sarge?
- He's away on his holiday.

13:46.159 --> 13:50.408
- Leave me up shit creek.
- Why? What's up with you?

13:52.408 --> 13:54.658
Remember that favour you owe me?

13:54.741 --> 13:59.615
Well, I'm looking for some boys to help
move a few 'things' off the beach there.

13:59.698 --> 14:03.157
It's an hour's work, tops.

14:03.240 --> 14:06.948
What sorta... things?

14:19.613 --> 14:21.988
Let's get outta here.

14:24.446 --> 14:27.405
Whale sandwiches forever, huh?

14:27.488 --> 14:30.087
Daly! The shovels!

14:30.588 --> 14:33.529
- What?
- Don't be leaving things behind, you!

14:33.612 --> 14:36.112
- Going, sir!
- Gobshite (idiot).

15:50.605 --> 15:52.647
Brilliant.

15:54.063 --> 15:56.854
Daly!

15:56.979 --> 15:59.521
Where are you, you gobshite?

16:08.895 --> 16:11.270
Daly!

16:14.436 --> 16:17.352
<i>...last night, but by the time the Coast
Guard arrived at the scene, the men...</i>

16:17.435 --> 16:21.185
<i>were no longer on board. With bad
weather set to hamper tomorrow's search,</i>

16:21.310 --> 16:23.616
<i>the hope of finding the
missing fishermen alive,</i>

16:23.617 --> 16:25.310
<i>has grown bleaker by the hour.</i>

16:25.394 --> 16:28.726
<i>Officials believe, the crew of the
Sea Harvester were washed overboard...</i>

16:28.809 --> 16:31.101
Hi, I'm just looking for an iron.

16:31.184 --> 16:32.759
Yeah, I'll just go and
hock it out for ya.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.476

16:39.267 --> 16:41.267

16:44.292 --> 16:45.165

- Thanks.

16:45.166 --> 16:47.875
Now, it gets very hot,
so just keep it moving, yeah?

16:47.876 --> 16:50.724
Okay, thank you. See you tomorrow.

16:55.224 --> 16:58.766
As a woman, to a man,
now I tell you, O'Shea,

16:58.849 --> 17:01.556
there's a twinkle in the
eye in there for you.

17:01.640 --> 17:04.848
- What?
- He'll be up in a minute!

17:08.265 --> 17:10.890
You like her?

17:10.973 --> 17:13.472
She's all right. A little uptight.

17:13.555 --> 17:16.472
- You should talk to her.
- I do talk to her.

17:16.555 --> 17:19.972
- I mean, talk to her.
- Ah, leave him off, Una.

17:20.055 --> 17:25.762
Do you listen to him? Eight years, I was
waiting for him to go down on his knee.

17:25.846 --> 17:27.730
Have you ever heard the like of it?

17:27.731 --> 17:30.638
My family thought I was mad,
wasting my time on him.

17:30.721 --> 17:34.720
- Ah, feck them.
- Ah, feck you, Brian.

17:39.262 --> 17:42.345
- Same again?
- Pour on.

17:56.926 --> 18:01.593
- What is it, Paddy?
- Wouldn't you like to know.

18:01.676 --> 18:04.635
- Not really, no.
- You would, though.

18:04.718 --> 18:08.217
- No, not really.
- You would.

18:08.300 --> 18:13.800
If you were to know what I know,
you'd want to know.

18:13.884 --> 18:16.841
- All right, tell us then.
- Right, you are.

18:16.924 --> 18:22.891
Between you and me, I caught
meself a sea monster today.

18:23.174 --> 18:26.465
Swear to God, may He strike me down.

18:26.548 --> 18:28.965
- You don't believe me?
- Not a bit.

18:29.048 --> 18:30.084
I am not a liar.

18:30.085 --> 18:32.215
- Huh!
- Feck off, you!

18:32.298 --> 18:34.548
All right, where is it?

18:37.422 --> 18:41.547
- In me bathtub.
- In your bathtub?

18:41.631 --> 18:44.131
Having a bath.

18:53.088 --> 18:55.171
Good night, Paddy.

18:56.505 --> 19:00.045
Ignorant bollocks.

19:00.129 --> 19:02.004
- What?
- Huh?

19:02.087 --> 19:04.629
- What did you say?
- Nothing, didn't say a word.

19:04.712 --> 19:07.254
He called you a bollix (idiot).

19:07.337 --> 19:09.927
If this wasn't the only fekkin'
pub on this shittin' island,

19:09.928 --> 19:12.003
I'd piss in it sooner than come in here!

19:12.086 --> 19:14.711
Fine, you are barred.

19:14.794 --> 19:17.586
Ah... I am joking. Come on now,
another one here now.

19:26.877 --> 19:30.085
<i>They are coming to get you, Barbara.</i>

19:34.251 --> 19:38.292
<i>- They are coming for you.
- Stop it! You are acting like a child!</i>

19:38.376 --> 19:41.376
<i>They are coming for you, Barbara.</i>

19:41.459 --> 19:43.039
<i>Look! There comes one of them now!</i>

19:43.040 --> 19:44.875
<i>- He'll hear you!
- Here he comes now.</i>

19:44.958 --> 19:48.500
Irene! Irene!

19:49.708 --> 19:52.208
- What?
- Someone's at the door!

19:52.291 --> 19:54.624
I'm not dressed!

19:57.457 --> 20:00.374
All right, all right.

20:00.457 --> 20:04.581
That better not be Paddy
and his stinking lobster.

20:13.081 --> 20:17.538
It's the bloody Declan Cooney,
and he's pissed as a fart.

20:17.622 --> 20:20.913
Don't give that cowboy any money. You're
gonna piss it up against the wall!

20:28.954 --> 20:32.162
Cooney, you look like death.
What are you doing?

20:37.370 --> 20:38.828
What does he want?

20:42.245 --> 20:44.953
To dance?

20:45.245 --> 20:48.494
Jesus, Cooney! Are you all right, mate?

20:52.702 --> 20:54.410
Cooney?

20:54.911 --> 20:56.911
Tadhg! Tadhg! Tadhg!

21:03.868 --> 21:06.543
- Tadhg!
- Oh, my God!...

21:08.967 --> 21:12.042
Tadhg! Oh! Tadhg!

21:18.043 --> 21:19.543
Irene!

21:23.143 --> 21:25.243
Tadhg! Tadhg!

21:38.406 --> 21:41.447
Okay... okay... okay...

21:44.905 --> 21:45.622
Okay...

21:46.905 --> 21:50.239
Sweet Jesus Christ, okay...

21:52.321 --> 21:57.446
Okay, okay, this is easy.
Okay, okay, okay, I can do this.

22:39.984 --> 22:43.150
- Hi.
- Come on down for a drink.

22:43.234 --> 22:44.858
No, I have work tomorrow.

22:47.399 --> 22:49.253
You know, it doesn't matter.

22:49.254 --> 22:51.733
Nobody's checking up on you.
It doesn't matter out here.

22:51.816 --> 22:54.066
- You are drunk.
- No, I'm not. No.

22:54.149 --> 22:55.440
Is that right?

22:57.440 --> 22:59.640
Say the alphabet backwards for me.

23:00.241 --> 23:01.341
Em...

23:05.565 --> 23:06.747
Zed...

23:10.314 --> 23:11.581
Et cetera.

23:13.814 --> 23:19.105
- I hope you are not driving.
- I'm taking Johnny's horse, yah...

23:19.188 --> 23:20.963
You are gonna ride a
horse while intoxicated?

23:20.964 --> 23:22.813
Yeah, so, the horse is sober.

23:24.146 --> 23:26.688
- Well, that's just brilliant.
- It's great.

23:26.771 --> 23:28.020
It's great that you are in charge here.

23:30.104 --> 23:33.354
Em, listen, em...

23:33.437 --> 23:36.087
I think we got off on the wrong foot.

23:36.937 --> 23:39.811
It's okay. I'm fine.

23:49.228 --> 23:51.185
It's nothing.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.977
Last drink's gone straight to me head.

24:00.892 --> 24:03.642
Do you get this drunk every night?

24:03.726 --> 24:08.184
Just... high days and holidays.

24:08.226 --> 24:10.767
Let's get you to bed.

24:12.141 --> 24:14.308
Now you are talking.

24:24.890 --> 24:26.724
Brian, ugh...

25:29.025 --> 25:31.169
Oh, ya little... such pa...

26:07.436 --> 26:08.211
Desist herself.

26:09.740 --> 26:11.005
Do I have something to sign?

26:11.089 --> 26:12.797
Oh, yes, the big one.

26:14.964 --> 26:17.547
- Looks like it should be nice out.
- There's a storm coming.

26:17.630 --> 26:20.975
Really? Are the gulls
flying low or something?

26:20.976 --> 26:22.754
No, it was on the telly.

26:26.629 --> 26:29.379
- You are not married, Lise, are you?
- No.

26:31.837 --> 26:34.295
Like O'Shea.

26:34.378 --> 26:37.087
- Well, widowed.
- Widowed?

26:37.170 --> 26:39.161
He wouldn't tell you.
No, he's a very private fella.

26:39.162 --> 26:41.752
With a few drinks and a nog, it might
come up, but not normally, no.

26:41.836 --> 26:43.952
There's no need for him to be
here, really. I think it's...

26:44.053 --> 26:45.502
bit of a sabbatical.

26:46.419 --> 26:49.944
Oh, if you need, at any stage,
a bigger bed, I have a lovely room,

26:50.027 --> 26:53.168
'The Honeymoon Suite', usually we
call it, off the back of the hotel.

26:53.251 --> 26:54.554
- It's very quiet.
- No, thank you.

26:54.555 --> 26:57.668
It has much bigger beds. If there's two
instead of one, you know you are salved.

26:57.751 --> 27:00.751
Because next week, we have a huge stag
party from Dublin, so if you want...

27:00.835 --> 27:03.750
- the bigger room, now is to book it.
- Okay, thank you. Goodbye.

27:03.834 --> 27:06.250
- All right, Lisa, have a great day!
- Thank you!

27:14.458 --> 27:16.541
Morning!

27:22.541 --> 27:25.457
Nice place you've got here.
Close to the beach, all mod cons.

27:25.540 --> 27:27.707
What happened?

27:27.790 --> 27:31.165
Section 4.1 of the Public Order Act:

27:31.248 --> 27:32.562
"It is an offence for any person...

27:32.563 --> 27:34.665
to be present in any public
place while intoxicated...

27:34.748 --> 27:38.497
to such an extent as would give rise
to a reasonable apprehension... "

27:38.581 --> 27:41.789
You arrested me?

27:41.872 --> 27:45.081
You passed out before I
could find your house.

27:49.330 --> 27:51.038
Garda Nolan.

27:52.288 --> 27:55.705
But I get a reward for
discovering it, a finder's fee.

27:55.788 --> 28:00.120
- We'll discuss it later.
- But I get something, right?

28:07.021 --> 28:07.821
Ugh.

28:09.578 --> 28:11.703
Is that your professional opinion?

28:11.786 --> 28:13.541
- A grabber.
- A what?

28:13.542 --> 28:15.911
I've told you, Paddy,
I'm not calling it that.

28:15.994 --> 28:18.993
It needs a name that defines it's genus.

28:19.077 --> 28:23.035
- I discovered it. I get to name it.
- All right. Hi.

28:23.993 --> 28:24.831
Hi.

28:25.993 --> 28:27.254
Hi.

28:28.910 --> 28:30.742
Hello.

28:31.742 --> 28:35.909
- What is that thing?
- I haven't a clue.

28:36.692 --> 28:41.200
I've never seen anything like it before.
It's a completely foreign species.

28:41.283 --> 28:43.366
I can't even begin
to origin it or class it.

28:43.450 --> 28:46.116
- A grabber.
- Paddy.

28:46.200 --> 28:48.783
- It has attacked you?
- Stalked on the ceiling, it was.

28:48.866 --> 28:51.824
- Nearly ripped me throat off.
- It's dead, right?

28:51.907 --> 28:54.949
- Um, I'm not sure.
- You are not what?

28:55.032 --> 28:58.740
The basic tests I've done so far have
shown up nothing usual or normal.

28:58.824 --> 29:01.157
It is beyond mystifying.

29:01.240 --> 29:04.364
I mean, really, I can't be
sure without opening it up.

29:07.823 --> 29:09.989
'Tis dead.

29:10.073 --> 29:15.238
Would you stop doing that?
Is it any wonder it bit you.

29:15.322 --> 29:20.113
- What's that in it's mouth?
- That... is it's tongue.

29:20.597 --> 29:22.113
Check it out.

29:27.154 --> 29:30.737
Spits like a frog and strangles ya.

29:30.821 --> 29:32.946
Whip it fast and sharp.

29:33.029 --> 29:35.815
So, I'm guessing this creature
bleeds it's prey like a leech,

29:35.816 --> 29:40.861
consuming the blood like
some sort of Vampyroteuthis.

29:40.945 --> 29:44.445
- Vampyro what?
- Vampyroteuthis.

29:44.527 --> 29:49.027
It's a rare deep-sea squid,
but no, this is not that, no.

29:49.110 --> 29:53.694
This is something totally
different, something alien.

29:55.818 --> 29:58.318
You know, in that it's
undocumented, not from...

29:58.401 --> 30:02.109
- It's gotta be worth a fortune.
- Oh, but... here's the thing.

30:04.359 --> 30:08.817
When I tried to clean some dirt off it,

30:08.900 --> 30:11.442
Well, I stood on it a few times.

30:11.525 --> 30:14.650
this happened.

30:21.524 --> 30:25.232
- What's that mean?
- All this thing needs to survive...

30:25.316 --> 30:28.648
is blood and water.

30:28.731 --> 30:33.481
Could you put it on the eBay?
Do you think?

30:33.565 --> 30:37.940
You are not putting this on eBay.
You are so lucky she didn't kill you.

30:38.023 --> 30:42.439
- She?
- Yeah, it's a... Sorry, excuse me.

30:42.522 --> 30:46.072
Yeah, it's a female,
from what I can tell.

30:46.155 --> 30:47.232
How can you tell?

30:47.233 --> 30:49.604
How can I tell? Well,
it's got no testicles.

30:53.479 --> 30:57.104
- And...
- Takes a scientist to realise that.

30:57.188 --> 31:01.395
Indeed, O'Shea. She was pregnant.

31:08.545 --> 31:09.562
That's disgusting.

31:09.645 --> 31:12.159
Well, a small fly in the
ointment there, Smith.

31:12.160 --> 31:17.102
How did that big egg come out of that?

31:17.186 --> 31:20.936
Mother Nature's a
mysterious woman, isn't she?

31:21.019 --> 31:24.893
Incredibly beautiful. Are you related?

31:27.268 --> 31:28.518
Do you think that grabber thing...

31:28.519 --> 31:30.893
could have anything to do
with those dead whales?

31:30.976 --> 31:34.017
- What makes you say that?
- Just a hunch, you know.

31:34.100 --> 31:38.267
- Oh, you get hunches now?
- No, I watch a lot of Columbo.

31:40.492 --> 31:44.266
- Why have we stopped?
- That's Declan Cooney's car.

31:48.183 --> 31:49.933
Cooney!

31:57.932 --> 32:01.682
- Where could he be?
- Nowhere without his keys.

32:04.556 --> 32:07.889
- You believe in coincidences?
- Not really.

32:07.972 --> 32:10.639
Neither do I. Come on.

32:15.846 --> 32:19.763
One of the light's on. So, how
come you are not in uniform?

32:19.846 --> 32:21.504
- It's Sunday.
- Ah.

32:22.005 --> 32:22.846
Neither are you.

32:22.930 --> 32:26.054
Suits ya. You look nice.

32:29.970 --> 32:34.179
- Smith's a nice fella, isn't he?
- "Positively smashing. "

32:34.262 --> 32:38.011
He's a proper gentleman,
and such polite company.

32:38.094 --> 32:40.761
Yeah, he's like you, married to his job.

32:40.844 --> 32:44.636
I'm not... I take pride in my work.

32:44.719 --> 32:45.611
Unlike you.

32:45.694 --> 32:49.343
Shh... I'm working.

32:52.302 --> 32:54.635
You are looking in the
wrong place, Columbo.

32:54.718 --> 32:57.718
Okay, hold it steady.

32:59.884 --> 33:01.879
You're something else, you know that?

33:01.980 --> 33:03.634
You should have joined
the Army, not the Guards.

33:03.759 --> 33:05.652
Stop talking to yourself,
it's very distracting.

33:05.653 --> 33:07.467
I'm not talking to meself,
I'm talking to you.

33:07.868 --> 33:08.768
Uh-huh.

33:09.175 --> 33:12.841
Great! Something up here.

33:12.966 --> 33:16.758
Could you be a bit more specific?

33:21.882 --> 33:24.174
It stinks like that thing.

33:26.632 --> 33:28.882
It's stuck on something.

33:31.464 --> 33:32.923
Jesus!

33:33.548 --> 33:36.381
Jesus! Crap, me nose!

33:36.423 --> 33:38.423
It's a head!

33:49.255 --> 33:51.422
- What killed him, Jim?
- The fact that he's just a head.

33:51.505 --> 33:55.796
You bring me someone with a head cold or
a headache, then I could do something.

33:55.879 --> 33:58.515
But you bring me just a head,
then you are taking the piss.

33:58.516 --> 34:00.212
Jesus, I could bury him in a shoebox.

34:00.296 --> 34:01.595
Doctor, we need to know.

34:01.678 --> 34:07.678
He was mauled, in some way, by some
animal or something. I don't know.

34:09.335 --> 34:11.128
- A tiger?
- A tiger?

34:11.210 --> 34:12.630
We can't put that on our report.

34:12.630 --> 34:15.293
But I am a country
doctor, for God's sake.

34:15.377 --> 34:17.627
What, am I going to run across stuff
like this, every day of the week?

34:17.710 --> 34:23.710
- Christ! Didn't I tell ya?
- Jesus! Paddy! What is it?

34:26.376 --> 34:29.001
How am I supposed to wash meself?

34:33.501 --> 34:38.000
Okay. Here is where
Cooney's car was abandoned.

34:38.083 --> 34:39.875
Here is Tadhg and Irene Murphy's house.

34:39.958 --> 34:42.375
Here is where the whales
washed up, and we're here.

34:42.458 --> 34:44.929
I was hoping it'll show
us some sort of pattern.

34:44.931 --> 34:47.998
Well, it's the letter 'Z'.

34:49.331 --> 34:51.291
Did you show that thing to
anyone else before we saw it?

34:51.373 --> 34:55.000
Tadhg Murphy got a look of it,
before I brought it home.

34:55.001 --> 34:56.166
It gawked (vomited) on him.

34:56.248 --> 34:58.206
Why?

34:58.290 --> 35:01.706
We think there might be another one
of those things. At least one anyway.

35:01.790 --> 35:05.248
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

35:05.331 --> 35:08.914
That thing you caught couldn't
have fertilised that egg by itself,

35:08.997 --> 35:11.247
which would mean
there's a male out there,

35:11.330 --> 35:14.164
big enough and strong enough to
knock a hole in your bathroom wall.

35:14.247 --> 35:17.664
- Smith said it needs water, right?
- Pfft, he says a lot of things.

35:17.747 --> 35:19.050
- Mostly bollocks.
- Whatever.

35:19.051 --> 35:22.246
But if it needs water to survive, how
could it be moving about on dry land?

35:22.329 --> 35:24.038
It was raining.

35:27.496 --> 35:30.995
When it's raining,
there's no such thing as dry land.

35:31.078 --> 35:33.328
There's a storm due tonight.

35:33.412 --> 35:35.162
It'll piss it down.

35:37.870 --> 35:41.369
Okay, all of this.
This area must be it's territory.

35:41.452 --> 35:42.330
Which would mean,

35:42.331 --> 35:46.202
it's got to be somewhere with access
to the waters around the west beach.

35:46.286 --> 35:50.452
Black Rock Caves. I caught
the female just beyond there.

35:55.743 --> 35:59.826
You know what's to blame for
all this? Global warming.

35:59.910 --> 36:04.617
You got your icebergs melting,
and your thingamajigs flooding.

36:04.700 --> 36:09.242
The whole world is drowning, and we
have don't have the gills for it.

36:13.324 --> 36:15.366
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

36:15.449 --> 36:17.491
- You gave me that look.
- What look?

36:17.574 --> 36:19.029
The "I feel sorry for you" look.

36:19.030 --> 36:20.574
- No, I didn't.
- Yeah, you did.

36:20.658 --> 36:24.532
No, I gave you the "I feel embarrassed
for you" look. Big difference.

36:24.615 --> 36:26.573
Shit, that's worse.

36:26.657 --> 36:31.032
Listen, I know I'm no
'dandy fop PhD' Smith's type...

36:31.115 --> 36:33.697
What's Smith got to do with
your raging alcoholism?

36:33.781 --> 36:36.239
I'm not a raging alco...

36:37.447 --> 36:41.156
You're some character, you
know that? A real character.

36:41.239 --> 36:44.821
- I'm a social drinker.
- Mhm, I'm sure you are.

36:46.363 --> 36:47.997
Now look, the tide's coming in.

36:47.998 --> 36:50.738
So, another hour and this
place will be underwater.

36:52.463 --> 36:56.320
Brandy McGuire drowned in there,
so be careful now.

36:56.404 --> 36:59.612
- Wait here.
- You can be sure of that.

37:45.191 --> 37:46.900
Wow!

38:04.231 --> 38:07.606
- Are we missing some fishermen?
- Huh?

38:54.007 --> 38:55.507
Oh, my God!

39:14.392 --> 39:16.682
- Hello!
- Geez, my heart!

39:16.766 --> 39:18.206
What are you doing?

39:18.207 --> 39:22.224
Just checking. What? You
know of a better way, hmm?

39:23.349 --> 39:24.932
Hello!

39:25.016 --> 39:28.431
What are you expecting?
"Hello, it's only me"?

39:32.265 --> 39:35.348
Run!

39:35.431 --> 39:37.805
Move! Come with me!

39:37.889 --> 39:39.805
- Lisa, hurry! Hurry!
- I'm trying!

39:39.889 --> 39:43.180
- Would you move your ass!
- Get your hands off my ass!

39:43.264 --> 39:45.430
Go!

39:51.138 --> 39:53.513
Come on, get up!

39:53.596 --> 39:56.096
- You okay?
- The size of it!

39:57.513 --> 40:00.345
We're okay. It can't
get through that gap.

40:00.645 --> 40:03.970
Ooh, Jesus! Whoa...

40:04.053 --> 40:06.678
- Leg it!
- Okay, go! Go!

40:06.762 --> 40:09.344
Paddy! Run! Run! Run!...

40:09.427 --> 40:11.386
Come on!

40:16.136 --> 40:17.769
<i>Haven Point Garda Station, please hold.</i>

40:17.852 --> 40:21.118
No, Regan, wait! No, we've got an
emergency! A real one, huge one!

40:21.201 --> 40:22.930
<i>What? Did you run out
of whiskey, O'Shea, huh?</i>

40:22.931 --> 40:24.985
Give me the phone. We need the ERU now!

40:25.068 --> 40:28.235
<i>Look, there is a storm coming. Coast
Guard's called all boats back to port.</i>

40:28.318 --> 40:32.009
<i>Now whatever it is, it's gonna have
to wait till the morning, all right!</i>

40:32.884 --> 40:34.903
Oh, good. You are back.
Listen, I have a theory.

40:34.904 --> 40:37.384
Those whales were killed as a
food source for their spawn.

40:37.467 --> 40:40.134
- The eggs are buried at the beach!
- Oh, yes, exactly.

40:40.217 --> 40:42.170
- Yeah, we know.
- Oh.

40:42.171 --> 40:44.174
And well done.

40:44.258 --> 40:45.028
What are you doing?

40:45.029 --> 40:47.174
Everywhere this has been,
the other one's followed!

40:47.258 --> 40:50.049
- You found another one? Where?
- It tried to eat us!

40:50.133 --> 40:53.090
And it's huge! And it's looking for her!

40:53.173 --> 40:54.682
Are you mad? Don't do that.

40:54.765 --> 40:55.737
Smith, it's for the best!

40:55.738 --> 40:57.882
No... if he lights
that in here, he'll...!

40:59.507 --> 41:04.181
Get it wet. Yo-u-u... really are Irish.

41:04.264 --> 41:08.131
- Can I shut it off?
- I'll-a... see youse later, lads.

41:10.797 --> 41:14.755
- No, it's that one here!
- No, it's not!

41:14.838 --> 41:17.546
- No, it's not that one!
- It's not that one!

42:22.124 --> 42:24.374
Is it dead?

42:26.124 --> 42:28.082
It think it's just resting...

42:30.789 --> 42:33.081
O'Shea! Oh, my God!

42:38.248 --> 42:40.747
It's trying to fuck me face!

42:48.538 --> 42:51.704
Stand up!

43:20.202 --> 43:23.076
Vicious little fuck!

43:47.906 --> 43:48.906
Oh...

43:49.907 --> 43:54.366
There goes THE scientific
discovery of our time.

43:54.449 --> 43:57.906
Imagine all that we
could've learned. Oh...

43:57.990 --> 44:00.031
Still moving?

44:11.622 --> 44:13.390
We are gonna need to get
help for the mainland.

44:13.391 --> 44:15.280
Oh, they'll never get across the water.

44:15.364 --> 44:17.904
What if those eggs hatch,
there's no whales to eat...

44:17.988 --> 44:19.779
Yes, they will head inland to feed.

44:19.863 --> 44:21.363
Finishing each other's sentences, now?

44:21.446 --> 44:22.496
- What?
- Nothing.

44:22.579 --> 44:25.477
I would've helped,
but I have a bad back.

44:25.478 --> 44:28.445
Gives me shocking pain,
you know, yourself.

44:28.528 --> 44:33.028
- How are you still alive, huh?
- Diet and exercise.

44:33.112 --> 44:35.528
Took three of us to get
that thing off of me.

44:36.820 --> 44:39.861
I was always lucky.

44:39.944 --> 44:42.819
Yeah, it mustn't have
liked your blood much.

44:42.902 --> 44:45.354
What have you been eating?

44:45.355 --> 44:49.693
I had a banana and a
bag of chips yesterday.

44:50.526 --> 44:53.360
You were drunk.

44:54.193 --> 44:56.985
They are like leeches, right?
Feed off the blood.

44:57.068 --> 45:01.234
Well, when one of them bit Paddy,
it almost died. Why?

45:01.317 --> 45:04.317
Because Paddy was so intoxicated,
his blood alcohol level was toxic.

45:04.400 --> 45:07.650
Exactly, if we taint our blood with
booze, we are poisonous to eat.

45:07.734 --> 45:09.442
Uh, yeah, in theory.

45:09.525 --> 45:12.191
You told me to cut back.

45:12.274 --> 45:13.594
Tomorrow we'll be sore, so they'll...

45:13.895 --> 45:16.941
that we will get off the island. They'll
nuke the beaches or whatever they do.

45:17.024 --> 45:20.358
But all we have to
worry about is tonight.

45:20.441 --> 45:23.190
It's simple.

45:23.273 --> 45:25.440
We have a 'lock-in'.

45:25.523 --> 45:28.648
We stay out of the rain, and we drink.

45:35.397 --> 45:38.397
- What?
- Listen, it's a hostile, migratory...

45:38.481 --> 45:40.897
- Grabbers.
- For God's sake.

45:40.981 --> 45:43.980
- Are you for real?
- Show him.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.605
That? Should've killed
that with a hammer.

45:51.688 --> 45:55.295
No... That's just the tip of
the blood-sucking iceberg.

45:55.296 --> 45:56.086
Grabbers?

45:56.099 --> 45:58.145
Okay, I give up.
Yes, it's a grabber. Well done.

45:58.229 --> 45:59.668
But if it's allergic to alcohol,

45:59.669 --> 46:02.187
couldn't we just hose it down
with vodka or some shit?

46:02.270 --> 46:03.761
- No... That won't work.
- How'd you know? Give it a go. Why?

46:03.844 --> 46:05.311
Can't, see because
alcohol is a poison, yes,

46:05.312 --> 46:07.178
but it has to be ingested
to have an effect.

46:07.261 --> 46:09.781
Could we not just spray
some whiskey in it's mouth.

46:09.782 --> 46:11.186
Feck that. Waste of whiskey.

46:11.269 --> 46:13.344
If you want to get that
close to it, good luck.

46:14.728 --> 46:18.227
- What's going on here, then?
- Just discussing something.

46:18.310 --> 46:21.477
- Looks like you are plotting something?
- No, no, no, no, no.

46:21.560 --> 46:26.309
Em, it's more like, em... planning.

46:31.226 --> 46:33.142
Oh, carry on.

46:35.934 --> 46:41.475
Great, it's her birthday next week. Now
she thinks this is something for her.

46:54.390 --> 46:57.057
The only people that
know about this are us.

46:57.140 --> 46:59.598
It's gotta stay that way,
or we'll have a panic on our hands.

46:59.681 --> 47:02.931
- So how drunk are we talking here?
- Paddy-levels of drunkenness.

47:03.014 --> 47:04.496
Have you gone off your game, boy?

47:04.497 --> 47:07.556
Uh, no offence, but I don't think
my body can handle Paddy-levels.

47:07.639 --> 47:09.766
Takes years of practice.

47:09.767 --> 47:12.430
And with everyone hammered, there's no
one in a fit state to call the shots.

47:12.513 --> 47:17.930
- I'll keep order. I won't be drinking.
- You? Then we'll both do it.

47:18.013 --> 47:22.471
Well, that would put you both at risk.
I suggest it's just O'Shea.

47:23.387 --> 47:26.637
Thanks. Only one of us need to risk it.

47:26.721 --> 47:30.845
And I know these people, this island,
better than you. Should be me.

47:35.511 --> 47:37.920
I see what you're doing here. But have
you forgotten you are a dependent...

47:38.003 --> 47:42.635
alcoholic organising a piss-up in a
brewery? I'll do it. It'll be easier.

47:42.719 --> 47:48.719
Lisa, I'm good to no one when I drink.
I know that. So do you.

47:49.802 --> 47:52.384
I can do this.

47:55.968 --> 47:59.134
- Okay.
- Yeah.

47:59.218 --> 48:05.175
But just so you know, I don't drink.
I've never even been drunk.

48:05.258 --> 48:09.508
- I don't know if I can.
- Of course you can.

48:09.592 --> 48:13.257
And you'll be the best drunken
garda this country's ever seen.

48:13.341 --> 48:15.591
You'll probably get promoted.

48:19.507 --> 48:20.669
Right, okay, well,

48:20.670 --> 48:24.006
if we are going to do this, we'll need
a blood test from a healthy subject.

48:24.090 --> 48:29.465
- Lisa, you are the fittest person here.
- Oh, you charmer. It's true though.

48:29.548 --> 48:33.173
Brian, I want a table of
everything Paddy had last night.

48:33.256 --> 48:36.505
- What night was last night?
- Saturday.

48:36.589 --> 48:39.630
- Oh, you gotta be joking me.
- Coming up.

48:48.379 --> 48:51.004
He never likes me as much as her.

48:51.088 --> 48:57.088
She was always the talented one.
Daddy's little girl. Bitch!

48:57.587 --> 49:02.462
But, I threw him out, for you guys.

49:02.545 --> 49:06.587
And I love you all.

49:06.670 --> 49:09.961
Even you.

49:11.294 --> 49:12.967
She's langered (drunk).

49:12.968 --> 49:14.852
For the size of her,
she's having her day good.

49:14.936 --> 49:17.960
Yeah, that's the lot.

49:18.043 --> 49:21.293
Hm, it's extraordinary. Well done, you.

49:25.001 --> 49:26.168
Thank you.

49:26.251 --> 49:29.792
- I also had a snifter of...
- What's that?

49:29.875 --> 49:31.523
It's a home brew.

49:31.524 --> 49:33.167
You bring poitÃ­n (illegal whiskey)
into my bar?

49:33.250 --> 49:36.459
- A bird never flew on one wing.
- When this is over, we need to talk.

49:36.542 --> 49:39.749
Ah, come off it. This could
save all our lives yet.

49:40.833 --> 49:43.249
- I'll take that!
- Give it back to me! Shit!

49:43.333 --> 49:44.791
Paddy!

50:01.664 --> 50:03.581
Careful.

50:03.664 --> 50:05.831
Up you get. Nice and easy.

50:05.914 --> 50:10.081
Guys, Jim, let's get ready
to do the blood test.

50:23.579 --> 50:27.204
- So if you're right, this will kill it.
- Bottoms up.

50:27.287 --> 50:29.662
Okay.

50:59.576 --> 51:03.576
- It must be a teetotaler.
- Bingo.

51:07.783 --> 51:09.325
Okay.

51:16.865 --> 51:19.157
That's good.

51:23.157 --> 51:25.990
- '.2'.
- Holy Christ.

51:26.074 --> 51:30.448
You unnatural eejit (idiot).
You are what could kill us. '.2'?

51:30.573 --> 51:34.073
You are looking at ten pints each,
depending on height and weight.

51:34.114 --> 51:37.988
We'll have to do shots.
Properly third the yard sound of it.

51:38.030 --> 51:40.363
So let's do it.

51:49.196 --> 51:54.112
The Mass is ended. Go in peace
to love and serve the Lord. Amen.

51:54.837 --> 51:59.603
Father, would you mind if I say a
few words? Hi, folks, how are ya?

52:00.178 --> 52:01.061
- "TÃ¡ go maith" (okay).
- Thanks.

52:04.361 --> 52:06.065
Just a quick announcement.

52:06.066 --> 52:10.194
At Maher's Tavern tonight,
we are having a bit of a shindig,

52:10.319 --> 52:16.027
and you are all coming to join us for
what'll be a great night's craic (fun).

52:19.985 --> 52:25.026
So, tell everybody. Tell your friends,
tell your families. Everybody's welcome.

52:25.109 --> 52:27.068
- You are throwing a party?
- Yeah.

52:27.151 --> 52:30.443
- Why?
- Who needs a reason to have a laugh?

52:30.526 --> 52:33.150
It's a welcome party for me.

52:33.233 --> 52:36.317
Welcome party? But you are
leaving in a fortnight.

52:36.400 --> 52:39.067
- This is a goodbye party, whatever.
- Yeah, well, you just got here.

52:39.150 --> 52:43.274
- What's her problem?
- Em, what we mean to say is that...

52:43.357 --> 52:46.982
Hey, bucko! Where are you going?
This party's for your benefit.

52:47.066 --> 52:48.721
And all of you are gonna be there too.

52:48.722 --> 52:51.857
Is... the law, and it's vertical.
I'll arrest any one of you who isn't.

52:51.941 --> 52:55.398
- You! Sit down.
- What Garda Nolan means...

52:55.481 --> 53:00.940
is that... we'd love your company.

53:01.023 --> 53:05.480
There's no point going home
to a cold, empty house...

53:05.564 --> 53:10.189
when there'll be music,
and company, and craic!

53:13.355 --> 53:16.063
- And a free bar.
- A free bar?

53:16.146 --> 53:18.604
- Oh, you are on, boys!
- That's the spirit!

53:18.688 --> 53:22.313
So come on, it's a party,
and the drinks are on us!

53:50.768 --> 53:54.560
How are you, Bridget?
How are you, Pascal?

53:54.643 --> 53:57.060
How are you, love?
Hey, mate, how are you, love?

54:01.267 --> 54:04.850
They are singing our song and
playing our tune, Father.

54:16.391 --> 54:18.474
All right, weapons. What have we got?

54:19.182 --> 54:20.932
Crap.

54:21.015 --> 54:25.098
I have a nail gun and a
board with a nail in it.

54:25.182 --> 54:28.348
Well, I've got a Harley
and a pellet gun.

54:29.140 --> 54:31.514
What are we going to
do with a pellet gun?

54:31.597 --> 54:34.806
Shoot pellets. But I
don't have any pellets.

54:34.889 --> 54:37.347
Oh, right. Well, you can
just wiggle it at them then.

54:37.431 --> 54:41.180
- All right, what have you got?
- I've got a flare gun!

54:42.680 --> 54:44.596
I have dibs on the flare gun.

54:46.138 --> 54:49.638
CPS 4100 Pump-Action
Twin-Jet Super Soaker.

54:49.721 --> 54:52.970
Shoots twenty feet. The nephew's.

54:53.054 --> 54:56.887
Brian, it's a water pistol.
This thing loves water.

54:56.970 --> 54:58.660
It's a water pistol if you use water.

54:58.661 --> 55:01.595
Fill it with petrol,
you've got a flamethrower.

55:02.179 --> 55:05.761
- Dibs on the water pistol.
- Right, look sharp, folks.

55:05.844 --> 55:10.303
You know your stations. Guard each
exit and don't let anyone out!

55:10.511 --> 55:11.619
- Bottoms up.
- Tequila!

55:11.620 --> 55:13.620
SlÃ¡inte (cheers).

55:30.217 --> 55:32.967
One! Two! Three!

55:44.214 --> 55:45.714
Whooooo!

55:47.715 --> 55:50.174
- Mamie!
- Two shandies, Brian's best.

55:50.257 --> 55:52.757
Two shandies for Mamie!

55:54.757 --> 55:57.298
- How's the heart, Mamie?
- Tip-top.

55:57.381 --> 55:59.506
Thank Christ for that! Next!

56:05.506 --> 56:07.505
Perfect.

56:13.047 --> 56:16.755
- Come here, come here, listen.
- Okay, I'm here.

56:16.838 --> 56:19.296
At the end of the day, it'll...?

56:20.879 --> 56:23.254
I don't know.

56:23.337 --> 56:26.212
- How much have you had?
- Not enough to fancy you.

56:26.296 --> 56:29.711
Well, then, keep drinking.

56:53.834 --> 56:56.001
Blow.

57:03.500 --> 57:06.208
That's it, is it?

57:06.292 --> 57:09.417
You think, I think, I fancy you.

57:14.166 --> 57:16.499
No more for you.

57:17.541 --> 57:22.456
Well, I do. So what do
you want to do about it?

57:22.540 --> 57:25.998
Arrest me?

57:28.548 --> 57:34.548
As... flattering as it is to
hear a... beautiful drunk...

57:35.747 --> 57:38.830
slurring her feelings for me,

57:38.914 --> 57:41.164
now is not the time.

57:55.495 --> 57:58.453
<i>Patrol to base, patrol
to base, come in, over.</i>

57:58.537 --> 58:01.370
Reading you loud and clear.

58:01.453 --> 58:03.495
<i>How're you doing in there?</i>

58:03.578 --> 58:06.827
Ignorance is bliss.

58:41.583 --> 58:42.516
I have to go and wizz.

58:45.949 --> 58:48.282
- You all right?
- I'm a bit bloated.

58:48.365 --> 58:50.948
You haven't touched your pint.
Are you gonna finish it?

58:51.032 --> 58:54.448
- Oh, hold it for me, will ya?
- Oh, here, right.

58:57.823 --> 58:59.792
Is there some fella in there
doing his make-up or something?

58:59.793 --> 59:01.614
Ah, they can't hold their drink.

59:01.697 --> 59:05.072
- Saviours!
- Wait, you've only had two pints.

59:05.973 --> 59:07.973
That's not Paddy-levels, the two.

59:30.279 --> 59:34.194
- Why do you drink so much, CiarÃ¡n?
- For the craic.

59:34.278 --> 59:37.944
Yeah, rite, and I work
everyday 'cause I'm driven.

59:38.028 --> 59:41.611
Always... chasing them goals, you know?

59:41.694 --> 59:46.235
Always chasing, always running.

59:48.652 --> 59:51.152
You're too hard on yourself.

01:00:00.609 --> 01:00:04.150
I feel like I've known
you for years, you know?

01:00:08.650 --> 01:00:10.608
Don't know why.

01:00:28.106 --> 01:00:30.939
I'm sorry about your wife, O'Shea.

01:00:31.064 --> 01:00:35.273
- My what?
- Una told me how she died.

01:00:37.105 --> 01:00:41.605
Of all the stories. Nobody died.

01:00:41.647 --> 01:00:44.897
We just, we didn't work out. That's all.

01:00:49.104 --> 01:00:52.229
- Shit, I'm sorry.
- Oh, you're grand (fine).

01:00:54.771 --> 01:00:59.520
Did you split because, um...
because of your alcoholic-isis?

01:01:01.686 --> 01:01:04.770
No, I didn't drink back then.

01:01:06.145 --> 01:01:09.102
She met someone else.

01:01:11.310 --> 01:01:13.769
That'll happens.

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.100
Feck her, O'Shea! If you want, I'll
find her, and I'll sort her out for you.

01:01:56.515 --> 01:02:00.265
A toast, from an alcoholic
to a workaholic.

01:02:20.471 --> 01:02:22.020
Get it off me!

01:02:24.803 --> 01:02:25.845
Jim!

01:02:28.303 --> 01:02:29.115
Jim!

01:02:30.116 --> 01:02:32.428
Okay, keep still! Keep still, Jim!

01:02:34.020 --> 01:02:39.019
- Drinks for everybody, on the house!
- Yayyyyy!

01:02:56.934 --> 01:03:00.634
Are you okay? Jim? Jesus! Man.

01:03:00.717 --> 01:03:05.300
- You okay, Jim? What were you doing?
- I needed to pee.

01:03:19.423 --> 01:03:20.507
No, Jim!

01:03:28.007 --> 01:03:29.964
Don't! No, Jim!

01:03:32.131 --> 01:03:34.006
You big ugly bastard!

01:03:40.463 --> 01:03:42.546
Fuck that!

01:03:46.255 --> 01:03:48.338
Come on, quickly! Quickly!

01:03:48.421 --> 01:03:50.754
Oh, Jesus, Mary, Mother of God!

01:03:50.837 --> 01:03:54.420
Quickly! That's it. Start the car! Start
the car! Come on, what are you doing?

01:03:54.504 --> 01:03:56.754
- Quick! You should race the car!
- Stop it! Stop...

01:04:09.919 --> 01:04:12.543
We are gonna die!

01:04:14.627 --> 01:04:17.668
I'm arresting you for
the murder of Dr. Gleeson!

01:04:17.752 --> 01:04:20.877
You don't have the right to say
anything, unless you wish to...

01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.834
No, what are you doing?
You can't arrest a grabber!

01:04:23.917 --> 01:04:29.334
<i>...but the kegs are outside.
We're out of spirits...</i>

01:04:29.417 --> 01:04:32.251
Brian, Brian, get the door.
Open the door now.

01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:41.500
That's it. Quickly, come on.

01:04:46.832 --> 01:04:48.999
Merciful shit.

01:05:01.914 --> 01:05:04.581
Brian, close the fucking door!

01:05:04.664 --> 01:05:06.622
Grab the table!

01:05:07.413 --> 01:05:10.122
- Smith!
- I can't feel my face!

01:05:10.205 --> 01:05:13.455
Smith! The lighter!

01:05:14.913 --> 01:05:19.246
Argh! God damn it, this thing's heavy!
Focus! Push the table toward me.

01:05:21.662 --> 01:05:23.746
Uh, your floor... Your floor is broken.

01:05:23.829 --> 01:05:27.161
Brian, forget that!
Help us barricade the door!

01:05:27.245 --> 01:05:30.036
- Smith!
- Your floor is broken.

01:05:30.120 --> 01:05:33.911
- Light me!
- Come on, Lisa, push!

01:05:33.995 --> 01:05:36.161
Focus. Look at me. Push.

01:05:37.910 --> 01:05:40.452
- You've blown it out.
- Don't climb on the table!

01:05:40.535 --> 01:05:42.410
- Okay.
- Get off the table, Lisa.

01:05:46.077 --> 01:05:48.534
- I can't do it.
- Brian, man, forget that!

01:05:48.618 --> 01:05:50.784
Come and help us do this!

01:05:50.868 --> 01:05:53.534
- Brian, what are you doing?
- You did it, Brian.

01:05:53.618 --> 01:05:56.493
- You put that down!
- Brian did it!

01:06:02.450 --> 01:06:05.408
No, don't be a hero.

01:06:08.283 --> 01:06:13.532
Argh! Big ugly bastard!
Have some of this shit!

01:06:13.616 --> 01:06:15.366
Die!

01:06:19.491 --> 01:06:21.281
Oh, Christ.

01:06:28.948 --> 01:06:30.823
Get up now!

01:06:36.489 --> 01:06:40.030
- What's going on?
- Um, nothing.

01:06:41.988 --> 01:06:43.063
Who's that at the door?

01:06:43.064 --> 01:06:45.821
Nobody! It's nobody! Come on,
everybody out into the bar!

01:06:45.904 --> 01:06:48.029
I'm gonna go check the booze situation.

01:06:48.113 --> 01:06:50.363
Smith, c'mon! C'mon, now! Smith, c'mon!

01:07:01.362 --> 01:07:03.861
We're dry.

01:07:03.944 --> 01:07:06.180
Unless someone goes outside
to change the kegs,

01:07:06.181 --> 01:07:07.777
we're done drinking for the night.

01:07:08.161 --> 01:07:14.111
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
I was just getting a taste for it.

01:07:20.568 --> 01:07:23.318
Lisa, could you stop the music.

01:07:23.319 --> 01:07:27.400
Folks, folks. Can I have
your attention, please?

01:07:27.484 --> 01:07:30.650
Listen carefully, we're
moving this party upstairs.

01:07:33.775 --> 01:07:37.399
- I know what kind of party's this.
- Sir, sir, it's just a precaution.

01:07:37.483 --> 01:07:39.941
A precaution to what?

01:07:40.024 --> 01:07:42.608
- I'm going home. I'm pissed.
- No!

01:07:42.691 --> 01:07:44.941
No, because... nobody can. You can't.

01:07:45.024 --> 01:07:47.982
- Why?
- It's raining!

01:07:48.065 --> 01:07:51.148
This party isn't for me,
Brian, is it? You lied to me!

01:07:51.857 --> 01:07:56.398
See, you? This is your fault!
You brought this thing to the island!

01:07:56.482 --> 01:07:59.939
Oh, relax. You'll
give yourself angina.

01:08:00.022 --> 01:08:03.647
I'll give you angina!
Outside, now! I claim ya!

01:08:03.731 --> 01:08:07.022
- Can't go outside!
- Because of the rain!

01:08:07.106 --> 01:08:09.494
All right! Put 'em up! Come on!

01:08:09.495 --> 01:08:11.605
Right, sir, I've had
enough of your bollocks!

01:08:12.938 --> 01:08:16.895
Paddy! Brian! Come on!
Now is not the time for this!

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:29.354
Okay, everyone! Don't worry, it's grand.
We've got it all under control.

01:08:29.437 --> 01:08:32.103
There's no one trying to kill you.

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:39.528
- We need more alcohol!
- Yeah!

01:08:42.102 --> 01:08:46.893
No! Again, stay back.
Smith, what are you doing?

01:08:46.935 --> 01:08:49.935
Smith! Smith!

01:08:50.060 --> 01:08:53.225
Smith, listen to me! Listen to me!

01:08:53.267 --> 01:08:58.100
It's bigger than you think.
Get back inside now, please.

01:08:58.142 --> 01:09:00.309
I'm begging ya!

01:09:00.392 --> 01:09:05.104
I need a photograph with it
for National Geographic...

01:09:05.906 --> 01:09:07.308
and Facebook.

01:09:07.390 --> 01:09:10.390
Feck your photos! Change the kegs!

01:09:10.392 --> 01:09:11.437
Paddy!

01:09:11.438 --> 01:09:13.783
What? He's sloommered,
sure he'll be fine.

01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:17.599
Go on, Smith! Fighting fella, you are!

01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:23.606
Smith, listen to me! I'm begging ya!
Get back inside, Smith!

01:09:23.930 --> 01:09:28.348
Come on! Smith! Listen to me!

01:09:28.389 --> 01:09:31.889
Shush, you'll scare it.

01:09:38.346 --> 01:09:41.513
You are beautiful.

01:09:47.054 --> 01:09:49.095
Oh, wow.

01:09:56.386 --> 01:10:02.011
Steady... You don't want to eat me.

01:10:21.343 --> 01:10:26.176
You see? I told you!

01:10:26.259 --> 01:10:31.592
It's just an animal.
It doesn't want to hurt you.

01:10:39.299 --> 01:10:41.049
Oh, okay, okay.

01:10:42.591 --> 01:10:43.674
Jesus.

01:10:46.424 --> 01:10:48.632
Everybody, upstairs now!

01:10:55.131 --> 01:10:56.798
What the hell is that?

01:11:14.129 --> 01:11:16.546
Everybody, stay calm!

01:11:21.129 --> 01:11:23.918
What in the name of
fuck were those things?

01:11:23.919 --> 01:11:26.212
Everybody okay? Yeah?

01:11:26.295 --> 01:11:29.045
Everybo... Stay calm! Stay calm!

01:11:29.128 --> 01:11:32.045
Anybody been bitten?

01:11:33.211 --> 01:11:36.836
Anybody been bitten? Look at me.
Has anybody been bitten?

01:11:36.919 --> 01:11:40.002
No? Good. You haven't been bitten,

01:11:40.586 --> 01:11:43.668
'cause of the alcohol
you've been drinking.

01:11:43.751 --> 01:11:48.751
This might sound crazy,
but they're allergic to drunk people.

01:11:48.835 --> 01:11:53.085
So there's no need to panic,
we're safe up here.

01:11:53.168 --> 01:11:57.542
And let's stay away from the windows.
I think it's best.

01:12:05.291 --> 01:12:07.249
We're gonna be fine.

01:12:24.165 --> 01:12:26.414
It's swinging one of Tommy
Riordan's sheep at the door.

01:12:26.497 --> 01:12:30.456
My cat does that, then leaves it
on the doorstep as a present.

01:12:30.539 --> 01:12:32.872
It's a bitch. A mating ritual.

01:12:32.956 --> 01:12:37.081
The female. It's following her scent.
So didn't she slime you on the lab?

01:12:39.663 --> 01:12:41.180
What does that mean?

01:12:41.263 --> 01:12:45.121
It'll try to mount ya, somehow.

01:12:45.205 --> 01:12:48.745
Failing that, it'll rip ya
limb from limb in frustration.

01:12:48.829 --> 01:12:51.579
Grand! Ah, sure, what can you do?

01:12:54.329 --> 01:12:55.995
What's your reading?

01:12:56.079 --> 01:12:58.911
Too drunk to drive a car, but not
drunk enough. We're sobering up.

01:12:58.994 --> 01:13:02.369
- What if we threw a bomb at it?
- Have you got semtex on ya?

01:13:02.453 --> 01:13:03.277
Not on me, no.

01:13:03.278 --> 01:13:06.869
How about if we like, uh,
push it off a cliff or something?

01:13:06.953 --> 01:13:10.743
How you say we feed it Father Potts.
Lest it eats shit, it'll choke to death.

01:13:10.827 --> 01:13:12.827
- I beg your pardon?
- Oh, feck.

01:13:12.910 --> 01:13:16.202
It was a joke, Father. I apologise.

01:13:19.452 --> 01:13:20.551
Okay.

01:13:21.534 --> 01:13:26.284
We know it does two things.
It drinks blood and it needs water.

01:13:26.367 --> 01:13:29.159
We took away one.
We can take away the other.

01:13:29.160 --> 01:13:29.923
What do you mean?

01:13:29.924 --> 01:13:32.366
We need to keep it away from
the water. Dry it out, somehow.

01:13:32.450 --> 01:13:33.663
Look outside!

01:13:33.664 --> 01:13:35.575
There's got to be some
way we can stop it.

01:13:35.658 --> 01:13:37.158
Fight fire with fire.

01:13:37.241 --> 01:13:39.991
- The thing!
- What?

01:13:40.075 --> 01:13:42.740
The fekkin' thing at Cooney's site.
What's it called?

01:13:42.824 --> 01:13:44.740
- A grabber.
- Yeah, exactly.

01:13:44.824 --> 01:13:49.365
With that thing, you could grab it,
and you could just f'kin' lift it up,

01:13:49.449 --> 01:13:52.240
and you could just hoist it up,
and leave it there, and trap it,

01:13:52.324 --> 01:13:54.681
and it'll be stuck in the air,
and then the sun will come...

01:13:54.682 --> 01:13:58.948
and the sun will come up, and
it'll be dry and that'll dry it out.

01:14:00.239 --> 01:14:02.163
Brian, have you got
the keys to your truck?

01:14:02.164 --> 01:14:03.780
No, that'll be on the kitchen table.

01:14:03.863 --> 01:14:06.613
I need them.

01:14:07.113 --> 01:14:08.371
You are sober.

01:14:08.372 --> 01:14:11.163
You can't be going down there,
those things will rip the head off ya.

01:14:11.247 --> 01:14:13.662
- Yeah, she's right.
- You might not get past them.

01:14:14.263 --> 01:14:17.153
But I know someone who could.

01:14:17.154 --> 01:14:21.529
Talking about the
drunken-est person we've got.

01:14:23.612 --> 01:14:26.403
Absolutely not. No.

01:14:26.486 --> 01:14:29.945
- Paddy, you go.
- Feck off, you.

01:14:30.428 --> 01:14:32.961
Brian. Brian should go.

01:14:34.345 --> 01:14:37.860
Thanks for that, um...

01:14:37.944 --> 01:14:40.902
Yup. Yeah... I... suppose I could, yeah.

01:14:40.985 --> 01:14:43.763
Your arse, you're going!
You're pickled, you fucking go!

01:14:43.764 --> 01:14:46.818
Just... Come on. I'm gonna go.

01:14:46.901 --> 01:14:49.193
No, no, it's too dangerous.

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:51.651
Newsflash, I'm gonna go because...

01:14:51.734 --> 01:14:56.234
I'm one of the best drunken garda
this country's ever seen, you said.

01:14:56.318 --> 01:14:57.592
Didn't you say it?

01:14:58.775 --> 01:15:01.675
I'm just gonna get the keys.
This is not gonna take it lightly.

01:15:01.676 --> 01:15:04.983
I'm just gonna go, gonna get
the keys. It's gonna be grand.

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:08.774
I'm your shining knight in silver armor.

01:15:13.024 --> 01:15:15.316
Right, if you get in trouble,
pull the trigger.

01:15:15.399 --> 01:15:16.924
Ho-ho, Savage!

01:15:18.066 --> 01:15:20.231
- Oh, careful.
- You missed.

01:15:20.315 --> 01:15:22.565
- Brian! Would you ever feck off it?
- Paddy!

01:15:23.731 --> 01:15:25.523
Just get the keys, I'll do the rest.

01:15:25.606 --> 01:15:27.523
Got it, just the keys.

01:15:29.605 --> 01:15:31.689
I'll be all right.

01:15:35.514 --> 01:15:36.839
Jesus Christ!

01:15:40.064 --> 01:15:42.146
It's okay! I'm all right.

01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:44.046
Shush, keep your voice down.

01:15:45.271 --> 01:15:46.704
She's a goner.

01:15:49.271 --> 01:15:53.270
- How're you gonna get to the truck?
- Well, run very fast.

01:15:53.353 --> 01:15:56.353
- Well, you're not that fast.
- No, he'll need a decoy.

01:15:56.437 --> 01:16:00.520
I've got it. If it's you it wants,
we give it what it wants.

01:16:00.603 --> 01:16:02.483
We make a dummy of you,

01:16:02.484 --> 01:16:05.644
dress it up as bait, and confuse
the shite clean out of it.

01:16:05.727 --> 01:16:08.977
- How do we make a dummy?
- Improvise.

01:16:43.183 --> 01:16:44.782
Focus.

01:16:56.983 --> 01:16:57.783
Ewh.

01:17:24.095 --> 01:17:25.687
I love this song.

01:17:26.970 --> 01:17:28.353
Hurry.

01:18:18.299 --> 01:18:22.006
Hey, everybody, stay calm!

01:18:34.630 --> 01:18:37.255
Fire! Fire!

01:18:58.295 --> 01:18:59.861
I smell smoke.

01:19:10.127 --> 01:19:12.919
Lisa! Lisa!

01:19:15.210 --> 01:19:17.918
Is there another way down?

01:19:28.833 --> 01:19:32.333
- Una, it's lovely.
- I don't think it's scary enough, lads.

01:19:32.417 --> 01:19:36.000
It is not a bleeding beauty contest!
Una, it's a scarecrow!

01:19:54.331 --> 01:19:56.998
Lisa! Lisa!

01:20:00.455 --> 01:20:02.514
Come on, for fuck's sake!

01:20:07.914 --> 01:20:09.913
Go, Lisa! Go!

01:20:15.538 --> 01:20:18.371
<i>O'Shea, O'Shea, do you read me?</i>

01:20:18.372 --> 01:20:22.328
<i>We're evacuating.
You did it, boy! You did it!</i>

01:20:25.912 --> 01:20:30.827
Stop now! Lisa, stop anywhere.
Okay, you can stop now.

01:20:30.911 --> 01:20:33.952
Lisa? Lisa, stop now! Stop!

01:20:36.494 --> 01:20:39.494
- We are here!
- Jesus! You're dangerous!

01:20:39.577 --> 01:20:42.576
Come on, quickly! Hey, it's not raining!

01:20:42.660 --> 01:20:44.526
How long do you think
it'll take it to dry out?

01:20:44.710 --> 01:20:50.685
- I don't know, couple of hours.
- Bollocks, where is the crane?

01:20:50.868 --> 01:20:53.117
- Shit!
- What are we gonna do now?

01:20:53.200 --> 01:20:54.835
Okay, I'm thinking if
I can get it over there.

01:20:54.836 --> 01:20:56.784
- Wait, we are not ready!
- Run! Run! Run!

01:20:56.785 --> 01:20:58.292
- Give me the keys!
- What keys?

01:20:58.293 --> 01:21:00.617
- Cooney's keys.
- There! Go! Run!

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:49.195
Come on, you...

01:21:50.479 --> 01:21:53.112
Just a little closer.

01:21:54.112 --> 01:21:58.944
What are you waiting for?
Come on and come and get me!

01:22:01.361 --> 01:22:04.153
Come on, you smelly bastard.

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:39.216
Get away from him, you C-U-U-U-UNT!

01:23:02.608 --> 01:23:04.316
Yaa-Hoooo!

01:23:39.977 --> 01:23:43.144
I think this calls for a celebration.

01:23:56.058 --> 01:23:57.142
No!

01:24:08.391 --> 01:24:10.141
SlÃ¡inte (cheers).

01:24:22.306 --> 01:24:25.681
Are you okay? You okay?

01:24:25.765 --> 01:24:27.972
He couldn't handle his drink.

01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:33.805
What are you doing?

01:24:36.222 --> 01:24:37.972
Ah! Shut your hole!

01:25:04.969 --> 01:25:08.136
That was fun, wasn't it?

01:25:08.219 --> 01:25:11.593
- Tell that to Una.
- Ah, she'll be grand.

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:17.010
Would you like a drink?

01:25:18.051 --> 01:25:20.718
I wouldn't say no.

01:25:25.092 --> 01:25:27.342
Here, I thought you'd run out of drink?

01:25:27.425 --> 01:25:31.384
- Have you poitÃ­n in your house?
- Is the Pope a Catholic?

01:25:36.633 --> 01:25:38.716
Here.

01:25:48.632 --> 01:25:51.882
I shouldn't have done that!

01:25:51.965 --> 01:25:55.214
Just kidding, I should.

01:25:57.172 --> 01:25:58.859
I think I'll take some time off.

01:25:58.860 --> 01:26:00.339
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

01:26:02.672 --> 01:26:07.130
You know, if you lived here,
you'd be home already.

01:26:08.338 --> 01:26:11.505
- Home of the Erin Island Grabbers.
- Uh-huh.

01:26:11.588 --> 01:26:14.046
It's gonna get mental around here.

01:26:14.130 --> 01:26:17.170
I'm gonna need all the help I can get.

01:26:48.584 --> 01:26:52.334
- Wanna get some breakfast?
- Yum! Yes, I do.

01:26:54.126 --> 01:26:57.584
I think we should go
and pick up Jim's dog.

01:26:57.709 --> 01:27:00.208
- Aw, Dr. Gleesons dog?
- Yeah.

01:27:00.650 --> 01:27:02.741
Yeah, she'll be missing her 'dad'.

01:27:02.825 --> 01:27:06.050
Aw, I've always wanted a dog.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:13.000
