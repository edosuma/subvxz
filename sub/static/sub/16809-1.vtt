WEBVTT

02:13.091 --> 02:14.842
I won.

02:14.927 --> 02:17.303
What do you mean, you won?
You did not.

02:17.387 --> 02:19.180
I did too. The old man
can still beat him.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.182
Oh, come on, Dad. You saw
it, didn't you? I won.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.100
Close. Really close.

02:23.227 --> 02:24.332
Yeah.

02:24.333 --> 02:25.436
All right. If it was close,
let's go again. We'll go...

02:25.521 --> 02:27.730
Wait a minute. How many times
do I have to beat you?

02:27.856 --> 02:30.066
- You beat me?
- Yeah, I beat you.

02:30.192 --> 02:32.276
- Hey. Hey!
- All right! Listen, you won!

02:32.361 --> 02:35.530
Leave your father alone. All this
exercise is making me hungry.

02:36.365 --> 02:38.157
Come on, Dad. All
right, you won.

02:38.242 --> 02:40.159
No, no. You won.

02:40.244 --> 02:42.537
- No, you won.
- No, no. You won.

02:42.663 --> 02:44.580
- No, you won.
- Mr. Childress?

02:44.665 --> 02:47.416
Telephone for you,
sir, on the terrace.

03:09.857 --> 03:12.149
Better get here as
soon as you can.

03:12.234 --> 03:14.360
I'll tell Peter.

03:14.444 --> 03:17.196
Hey, what will living in
the States be like, Dad?

03:17.281 --> 03:20.324
I don't know. You've
been away a long time.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.661
Yeah, it's been since Mom died.
Yeah.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.538
Why Chicago?

03:25.622 --> 03:28.541
Good school for you. The best.

03:28.667 --> 03:32.044
- You could go out for football.
- What, and give up soccer?

03:32.129 --> 03:35.006
Well, football's more
popular in the States.

03:36.091 --> 03:39.427
Football players are more
popular with the girls.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.682
Dad.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.226
I don't know. School and
sports, all that stuff-

03:49.104 --> 03:52.064
I just won't fit in there.
Feel like some kind of freak.

03:52.190 --> 03:53.590
What is this?

03:53.591 --> 03:54.990
I don't know. Maybe if I
knew what was wrong with me.

03:55.068 --> 03:57.778
There's nothing wrong with you.

03:57.863 --> 03:59.530
Well, I might do okay in a zoo.

03:59.615 --> 04:03.075
Now, what the hell are you doing?
Feeling sorry for yourself?

04:03.160 --> 04:07.580
Okay, you have a talent that would
shock the hell out of people,

04:07.664 --> 04:10.333
but it's a talent that also
can be put to good use.

04:10.459 --> 04:12.335
- Dad...
- It's nothing to be ashamed of.

04:12.461 --> 04:14.483
Now, Childress understands this.
That's why

04:14.484 --> 04:16.505
he wants you to go to
this school in Chicago.

04:16.589 --> 04:20.593
You'll meet other kids that are...
that are special like you.

04:23.388 --> 04:27.808
Robin, I'll be with
you all the way.

04:27.893 --> 04:30.895
If it doesn't work out,
we'll do something else.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.318
Robin.

04:37.402 --> 04:40.112
Do me a favor. I want to talk to
your father alone one minute.

04:40.197 --> 04:42.198
Sure. I'll be on
the terrace, Dad.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.783
Okay.

04:48.288 --> 04:49.789
Peter,

04:51.166 --> 04:53.167
you've gotta give me the
telephone number...

04:53.251 --> 04:55.419
of that dame from
the antique shop.

04:57.005 --> 05:00.508
Nothing antique about her.
Everything works.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.469
Gonna miss you.

05:03.553 --> 05:05.471
Well, I'm not gonna miss you.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.766
Twenty years together in the
same agency is more than enough.

05:08.892 --> 05:10.434
You taught me a lot.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.207
- No, you did.
- Look, if this is gonna be a

05:12.208 --> 05:13.854
teary farewell, get
your ass out of here.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.273
No tears. All laughs.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.776
Right.

05:26.410 --> 05:28.828
I'll say good-bye to
your son over there.

05:38.380 --> 05:39.880
Waiter.

05:44.428 --> 05:46.554
Regular luncheon for two.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.612
My Dad!

06:04.698 --> 06:06.032
Get Robin out of here!

06:09.453 --> 06:10.683
Dad.

06:10.684 --> 06:11.912
Robin, your father's all right.
He's a professional.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.375
They're after my Dad. Robin,
they're after all of us.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.826
For Christ's sakes.

06:55.332 --> 06:56.832
Dad?

07:36.832 --> 07:40.292
They killed my Dad.

07:43.088 --> 07:45.214
Oh, I'm sorry.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.757
I'm sorry.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.635
They killed my Dad.
It's all right.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.639
Robertson, where
the hell are you?

07:53.723 --> 07:56.392
Give me the gun! I'm gonna find
out who broke that security.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.518
- I'll check on it.
- No! Get this boy out of here.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.833
Come on, Robin. Move. Let's go.
Into the car.

07:59.834 --> 08:01.063
Get him out of here.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.690
Let's go. Hurry. Come on!

08:02.691 --> 08:04.191
It'll be all right, Robin.
It'll be all right.

08:16.580 --> 08:17.831
I'm sorry, sir.

08:17.832 --> 08:19.081
It's all right, Jonathan.
You did a very good job.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.666
- Thank you.
- I'm proud of you.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.335
- Up by the road. Go on.
- Sure.

08:23.420 --> 08:24.920
Give me the film.

09:01.124 --> 09:03.834
That's the great Johnny Dunbar.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.462
In Chicago it's already
87 degrees this morning,

09:06.546 --> 09:08.172
13 minutes after 10:00.

09:08.256 --> 09:10.216
So I said, "Mother, what
do you want from me?"

09:10.300 --> 09:13.427
I mean, you got this terrific job.
You're all over the world.

09:13.511 --> 09:16.096
I mean, I get to see you maybe
once a month, if I'm lucky, right?

09:16.097 --> 09:19.183
"Okay, I'm happy for you.
I really am."

09:19.267 --> 09:22.561
But I said, "Just don't
try and run my life..."

09:22.646 --> 09:25.064
when you happen to be around
the house for a few days...

09:25.148 --> 09:26.815
"and feel like playing Mom."

09:26.900 --> 09:28.901
I know.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.403
They just... They just
don't know how to let go,

09:31.488 --> 09:33.989
and they get so hurt when
you try to explain to them.

09:34.074 --> 09:36.242
Really.

09:36.326 --> 09:38.786
Anyway, let's see if
you know this junk.

09:38.870 --> 09:42.665
January 10, 1946.

09:42.749 --> 09:46.835
That was the first United
Nations General Assembly...

09:46.920 --> 09:49.088
that was held in London, right?

09:49.214 --> 09:51.840
- Good.
- See, I told you. I never forget dates.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.886
All right. Who was elected
President of the assembly?

09:55.971 --> 09:58.138
It's names I have trouble with.

10:04.354 --> 10:07.439
- LaRue, don't tell me.
- I didn't say anything.

10:07.524 --> 10:09.566
Yes, you did. You said
"Raymond." I heard you.

10:09.651 --> 10:12.861
I did not. Raymond? His
name wasn't Raymond.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.947
It was...

10:15.031 --> 10:16.532
Raymond Dunwoodie.

10:18.076 --> 10:20.703
Who was Raymond Dunwoodie?

10:20.787 --> 10:22.496
I don't know. It's just...

10:22.580 --> 10:25.082
That-That name just came into my head.
I don't know.

10:25.208 --> 10:26.834
So what was the right answer?

10:26.918 --> 10:29.044
Paul-Henri Spaak of Belgium.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.213
Oh, yes, Paul-Henri Spaak.

10:31.339 --> 10:33.632
Okay. Next. I always
get that one wrong.

10:33.717 --> 10:37.136
"The five permanent members of the U.N.
Security Council are?"

10:37.220 --> 10:40.848
The United States, Russia...

10:42.642 --> 10:44.143
I know.

10:46.521 --> 10:48.897
Let's just forget
the whole thing.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.607
Forget it? Are you crazy?

10:50.734 --> 10:52.318
We've got a final. LaRue,
I know this stuff.

10:52.444 --> 10:54.028
We have a final at 2:00.

10:54.029 --> 10:55.612
I know, and I'm gonna
pass with flying colors.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.073
I promise you.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.658
- Hey, guess what.
- What?

10:59.743 --> 11:01.285
We got a buddy.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.163
Oh, my God. What a...
What a creep.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.415
He's walking backwards now.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.500
- Should we give him money?
- No!

11:08.585 --> 11:10.210
God, what do you take me for?

11:10.295 --> 11:13.547
I don't know. Oh, he's
not gonna bother us.

11:18.428 --> 11:20.220
- I hope we pass.
- Sure!

11:20.305 --> 11:21.847
- Here.
- Two popcorns, please.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.974
- Hello?
- Mr. Johnson?

11:24.059 --> 11:25.351
Yes?

11:25.435 --> 11:28.395
It's Raymond Dunwoodie.
What is it, Raymond?

11:28.480 --> 11:31.523
Now, look, I haven't
changed my mind.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.026
I mean, there's nothing I
can do for you personally,

11:34.110 --> 11:38.113
but I may have somebody
to locate your son.

11:38.198 --> 11:40.699
You'd better not be
wasting my time.

11:40.784 --> 11:44.036
No, no. I'm at the beach,
and I made a contact.

11:44.120 --> 11:48.165
She's a kid... m-maybe 17...
and she's psychic.

11:48.291 --> 11:51.001
Are you sure? That's
right, she's psychic.

11:51.086 --> 11:52.920
Bring her here.

11:53.004 --> 11:56.006
I don't have her yet,
but I could get her.

11:56.091 --> 11:59.301
Now, look, Mr. Johnson?

11:59.386 --> 12:01.762
This is gonna cost.

12:01.846 --> 12:03.972
How much?

12:04.057 --> 12:07.893
I don't mean 50 or 100 bucks.
Not for this girl.

12:07.977 --> 12:09.728
How much, Raymond?

12:09.813 --> 12:12.064
$1,000.

12:12.148 --> 12:15.234
I don't have that
kind of money.

12:15.318 --> 12:18.112
Oh, that's a sad story, Mr. J.

12:18.196 --> 12:21.073
Almost as sad as the story
you told me about your boy.

12:21.157 --> 12:23.909
Dunwoodie paid off for us.
We've completed the trace.

12:23.993 --> 12:26.620
He's talking to Sandza
at the Plymouth Hotel.

12:37.340 --> 12:39.383
Step inside, off the street.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.176
Yes, sir.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.473
Is this man registered here?

12:46.558 --> 12:48.434
I don't know.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.227
I just came on a half
hour ago myself.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.521
We think he's been
here a few days.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.606
You ain't the police, is you?

12:57.193 --> 13:00.195
Oh, well, I'm what you'd
consider well-traveled,

13:00.280 --> 13:02.322
but I don't believe I ever
heard of you gentlemen.

13:02.407 --> 13:04.825
We don't spend a dime
on public relations.

13:05.827 --> 13:07.619
Yeah, well,

13:07.704 --> 13:10.497
that would be Mr. R.V.
Johnson, Room 512,

13:10.582 --> 13:12.749
just down the hall to your left.

13:13.877 --> 13:16.670
Hey, government man. Don't
bust my door down, please.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.714
Use the pass key.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.670
Chase 1 to Chase 2...

13:58.755 --> 14:01.048
He's loose. Do you copy?

14:04.969 --> 14:06.887
He's loose. Do you copy?

14:09.432 --> 14:13.435
Chase 1 to Chase 2. He's loose.
Do you copy?

14:20.443 --> 14:22.569
Gunmen of the Hanafi
Muslim sect...

14:22.654 --> 14:25.197
continue their siege of
three Washington buildings.

14:27.158 --> 14:30.702
Damn it. Did you
hear that, Vivian?

14:30.787 --> 14:32.829
Now, that's what
I'm talking about!

14:32.914 --> 14:36.250
Them bozos in Washington are
mugging the whole damn country.

14:36.334 --> 14:38.710
They got every court in the
land helping 'em make it legal.

14:38.795 --> 14:41.838
Yeah, well, if you ask me what happened
to the milk of human kindness,

14:41.923 --> 14:43.590
I'd have to tell you, frankly,

14:43.675 --> 14:46.969
that the whole world has
dried up at the tit.

14:47.053 --> 14:49.346
You can say that again, pal.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.348
I swear to hell, I
don't know where...

14:51.432 --> 14:52.891
Vivian!

14:52.976 --> 14:55.352
Yes, Mother Nuckells.
I'm coming.

14:55.436 --> 14:59.106
Couldn't you just once manage
to go potty by yourself?

14:59.190 --> 15:02.943
Somebody's in my room!

15:03.027 --> 15:06.613
All right, now. Nobody's
going to get hurt.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.324
I just want some clothes.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.493
He came in my window.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.495
Do you know who he is?

15:13.580 --> 15:15.747
I told you we should've
moved to Melrose Park.

15:15.832 --> 15:19.209
Harry, this wouldn't be happening
if we lived in Melrose Park.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.753
You want clothes.

15:21.838 --> 15:24.923
Old clothes.
Anything you've got.

15:25.008 --> 15:29.052
You can see, I need clothes. I
can't go anywhere like this.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.762
Just... the clothes.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.556
Yes.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.891
Oh, I had to leave the
hotel in a hurry,

15:34.976 --> 15:37.644
so could you spare a
couple of dollars?

15:38.813 --> 15:40.856
I knew it.

15:42.150 --> 15:45.861
This is a graphic
example of biofeedback.

15:46.863 --> 15:50.032
We're converting the very
low-voltage Alpha-wave energy...

15:50.116 --> 15:52.659
into electricity
to run that train.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.454
And that train will only run
when my friend Hester...

15:55.538 --> 15:57.914
is in Alpha.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.130
Now, as you may have hoped,

16:05.214 --> 16:09.051
there are more practical applications
to biofeedback training.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.428
If you can learn to
regulate your brain waves,

16:11.512 --> 16:13.347
you can gain control
of your heart rate,

16:13.431 --> 16:15.515
blood pressure,
headaches, backaches,

16:15.642 --> 16:18.393
even, ladies, cold feet.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.354
Now, I work at the
Paragon Institute,

16:20.438 --> 16:23.982
where we study the phenomena
of extrasensory perception.

16:24.067 --> 16:27.361
And we are using
biofeedback techniques...

16:27.487 --> 16:31.031
to tap the almost limitless
resources of the human mind...

16:31.115 --> 16:35.994
And I am speaking now of such
things as thought transmissions,

16:36.079 --> 16:38.914
commonly known as telepathy.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.541
Now, that machine is
called a magnetometer,

16:41.626 --> 16:44.086
and it records the
fluctuations...

16:44.170 --> 16:47.464
of the human
electromagnetic field...

16:47.548 --> 16:49.466
during our experiments,

16:49.550 --> 16:52.010
and I guess Hester's had it.

16:52.095 --> 16:54.179
Thank you, Hester.

16:54.263 --> 16:58.100
I want to stress that no particular
talent is needed to achieve this.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.727
Anybody can achieve Alpha,

17:00.812 --> 17:03.105
with a little patience.

17:04.272 --> 17:08.944
- Want to try?
- Sure.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.324
Try to remember...

17:14.409 --> 17:17.536
that "Alpha" is another
word for "passive."

17:17.619 --> 17:19.079
Right.

17:19.163 --> 17:21.540
Visualize sitting in
an empty theater...

17:21.624 --> 17:23.875
in front of a blank screen,

17:23.960 --> 17:26.877
and let that screen
fill your mind.

17:27.003 --> 17:28.505
- Okay.
- Okay?

18:15.011 --> 18:17.971
Gillian? Hey, hey, hey.
Are you all right?

18:18.055 --> 18:19.723
What is she doing?

18:19.849 --> 18:21.349
I have no idea.

18:22.477 --> 18:25.437
Don't mind about them. It's okay.
You all right?

18:25.521 --> 18:26.980
Creep.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.775
I'd say I'm pretty sound,

18:29.859 --> 18:31.860
considering the
ravages of time.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.613
For instance, I don't have
the use of any more...

18:34.697 --> 18:37.824
than one of my limbs
or vital organs.

18:37.909 --> 18:40.243
Good thing the Lord
God Jehovah...

18:40.328 --> 18:43.163
built in so many spare parts.

18:43.247 --> 18:46.208
But when the old ticker
gives out, well, that's it.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.793
Ain't that the truth.

18:47.877 --> 18:49.920
How long do you think
you'll be staying?

18:50.004 --> 18:52.297
Oh, shut up, Vivian.

18:52.381 --> 18:54.800
Let the boy enjoy
his breakfast.

18:54.884 --> 18:56.384
Thank you.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.345
What is it they want you for?

18:58.429 --> 19:00.555
I'm a high-level security risk.

19:10.399 --> 19:12.317
Did you get it yet?

19:14.487 --> 19:16.196
- No.
- It's been over two months!

19:16.280 --> 19:18.615
Would you shut up, Betsy?

19:20.993 --> 19:22.953
It does not. I mean,
it happens...

19:23.037 --> 19:25.664
Gillian, I was saving
that seat for Cheryl.

19:25.748 --> 19:28.291
Too bad. Cheryl can
sit over here.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.710
Oh, God. Now what
am I gonna do?

19:30.795 --> 19:34.589
Oh, Cheryl, I'm sorry. I tried to save a
seat for you, but Gillian just took it.

19:34.715 --> 19:37.175
Look, you can have my seat.
Hey, watch it.

19:37.260 --> 19:40.303
Good Lord, Pam. If you're that
nervous, why don't you masturbate?

19:45.518 --> 19:47.185
Are you ready for that?

19:47.270 --> 19:50.230
Are you ready for tomorrow?

19:56.612 --> 19:58.947
You two are so sweet.

20:02.326 --> 20:05.078
When are you getting married?

20:13.129 --> 20:15.213
See any ghosts today, Gillian?

20:15.298 --> 20:17.507
Cheryl, you're not very funny.

20:17.592 --> 20:19.843
Gillian's not very funny.

20:19.969 --> 20:23.972
I mean, there are more mature ways to get
attention, don't you think, Gillian?

20:26.058 --> 20:28.476
Say, have you guys seen
Mr. Watkins's new girlfriend?

20:28.561 --> 20:31.396
Oh, yeah. Where'd he
pick that chick up?

20:31.480 --> 20:32.772
Read my mind!

20:35.109 --> 20:36.568
What?

20:36.652 --> 20:38.486
Tell me what I'm thinking.

20:39.655 --> 20:41.531
Come on. Right
now, read my mind.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.533
Well, that's what they say
you can do, isn't it?

20:43.618 --> 20:46.745
No. I don't know how to read minds, Cheryl.
That's ridiculous.

20:46.829 --> 20:49.372
- Listen, Cheryl...
- Shut up, LaRue!

20:50.374 --> 20:52.959
I only want to find something out.
That's all.

20:53.044 --> 20:55.670
All right. Come on.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.297
Oh, great. Good.

20:57.381 --> 20:59.090
Now pay attention, everybody.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.969
- Gillian's gonna perform for us.
- I didn't say I...

21:03.054 --> 21:05.931
Cheryl, look. I don't know anything
about reading minds, all right?

21:07.266 --> 21:09.809
I mean, I don't even know what
I'm thinking most of the time,

21:09.894 --> 21:13.313
so... get off my back.

21:15.524 --> 21:17.317
Gillian, you're so full of shit.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.945
Cheryl, you're an asshole.
Just shut up.

21:21.197 --> 21:23.114
She can't help being upset.

21:23.199 --> 21:25.116
She has to take it
out on someone.

21:29.372 --> 21:31.039
What did you say?

21:32.875 --> 21:35.755
Oh, Cheryl, you don't want everyone
to know that you're pregnant, do you?

21:35.836 --> 21:37.317
What? I would like for you to
explain that little remark!

21:37.318 --> 21:38.797
Cheryl...

21:38.881 --> 21:40.966
Just what do you think
you know about me?

21:41.050 --> 21:43.301
- I'm sorry. I didn't...
- Come on, tell me!

21:43.386 --> 21:45.387
- Let go, Cheryl. Let go.
- Tell me!

21:45.471 --> 21:47.305
- Tell me.
- Cheryl, please let go.

21:47.390 --> 21:49.015
- Cheryl.
- Come on, tell me.

21:49.100 --> 21:52.060
- No! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God!

21:52.144 --> 21:54.980
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God!
- Are you all right, Cheryl?

21:55.064 --> 21:58.650
Help me!

21:58.734 --> 22:02.153
Oh, God. Oh, God!

22:16.544 --> 22:19.629
I put some cookies
in a bag for ya.

22:19.714 --> 22:21.798
You might get hungry later on.

22:21.882 --> 22:23.216
Thank you.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.593
How's your hair? Dry yet?

22:25.678 --> 22:27.637
Oh, it's fine.

22:27.722 --> 22:29.180
Hey!

22:29.265 --> 22:30.765
Just fine.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.226
That Shinola will
wash right out.

22:33.310 --> 22:37.397
I'd appreciate it if you'd wait
till after M*A*S*H to let them go.

22:37.481 --> 22:40.942
M*A*S*H? I'll wait
till Sunrise Semester.

22:43.946 --> 22:46.031
Might as well just
leave 'em there.

22:46.115 --> 22:49.200
They ain't got anything
to say I want to hear.

22:49.285 --> 22:52.454
I've heard it all before.

22:52.538 --> 22:55.248
Peter. That your real name?

22:55.332 --> 22:57.125
That's right.

22:57.209 --> 23:00.879
Can't see a reason why you'd
make up lies to tell me.

23:00.963 --> 23:02.672
I don't matter anyhow.

23:02.757 --> 23:04.674
I wouldn't lie to
you, Mother Nuckells.

23:04.800 --> 23:06.885
You know that.

23:08.846 --> 23:10.847
And I hope you find your son.

23:12.058 --> 23:15.393
If he's alive, I'll find him.

23:15.478 --> 23:18.438
And if the feds get in
your way, shoot 'em.

23:18.522 --> 23:21.191
Just shoot 'em. It's
all they deserve.

23:21.275 --> 23:24.986
Yeah. There's so many of 'em.
They just keep coming.

23:25.071 --> 23:26.988
Kill 'em. Kill 'em.

23:27.073 --> 23:29.908
Now, don't overwork
yourself, Mother Nuckells.

23:29.992 --> 23:32.786
Remember, it's bad
for the old ticker?

23:34.872 --> 23:36.539
Thank you.

23:39.835 --> 23:42.670
You want to get us
out of here now?

23:44.340 --> 23:47.550
Come on, Mother. Oh, please!

want to go home?

25:46.086 --> 25:48.630
I mean, you ever heard better
fucking stereo sound in your life?

25:48.631 --> 25:51.466
How can you be sure it's Sandza?

25:51.550 --> 25:53.551
He had to be in
the neighborhood.

25:53.636 --> 25:55.678
All we had to do was wait.

25:55.763 --> 25:57.388
I trained with him.
I know his style.

25:57.473 --> 25:59.641
What's he doing now? Over.

25:59.725 --> 26:02.644
Looks like off-duty cops in
that Cadillac ahead of us.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.396
There's nothing he can do now.

26:07.274 --> 26:10.068
- Can I help you, pop?
- You're under arrest.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.195
What?

26:12.279 --> 26:15.782
You're under arrest for
impersonating police officers.

26:15.866 --> 26:18.117
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look out!
What the hell!

26:18.202 --> 26:20.954
He's got a piece.
It's in my armpit.

26:22.331 --> 26:24.666
All right. What do
you want me to do?

26:24.750 --> 26:27.001
Drive down that alley. Fast.

26:43.102 --> 26:45.270
Crazy son of a bitch!

26:48.357 --> 26:50.984
Take a right. Head for
Lower River Drive.

26:51.068 --> 26:52.652
Faster.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.863
Damn!

26:57.032 --> 26:58.908
Holy shit!

27:07.626 --> 27:09.294
Should I drive a little faster?

27:09.420 --> 27:12.005
- No. Slower.
- Slower?

27:13.007 --> 27:15.800
Right now, you're the only two people
in the world I feel safe with.

27:15.884 --> 27:18.177
I want to enjoy your company.

27:18.262 --> 27:20.680
Yeah, okay. Sure. Sure.

27:20.764 --> 27:23.766
Why not? We'll... We'll just
cruise around a little bit.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.810
Maybe after a while,
you'll want to talk.

27:25.894 --> 27:28.062
Yeah.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.566
What's your name?

27:32.985 --> 27:35.361
- Peter.
- I'm Marty O'Brien.

27:35.446 --> 27:37.697
Is that gun too uncomfortable
in your armpit?

27:37.781 --> 27:41.117
Oh, no, no, no. I want you to meet
my partner, Officer Eggleston.

27:41.201 --> 27:44.370
Hi, hi, Peter. Why
don't you call me Bob?

27:45.456 --> 27:46.873
Hi, Bob.

27:46.957 --> 27:48.249
Nice car.

27:49.585 --> 27:51.711
Yeah. It's brand-new.

27:51.795 --> 27:54.172
I just picked it up
about a half hour ago.

27:54.256 --> 27:57.508
I... sure wouldn't want
anything to happen to it.

27:57.593 --> 27:59.427
Don't blame you.

28:00.179 --> 28:03.681
That shoe Polish in
your hair, Peter?

28:03.766 --> 28:06.434
Yes, it is. It's a disguise.

28:07.686 --> 28:09.937
- It's a pretty clever disguise.
- Yeah.

28:10.022 --> 28:13.024
Didn't work though. They
were waiting for me.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.109
Must've been waiting all day.

28:16.528 --> 28:20.114
I gotta give that Childress a lot
of credit, the son of a bitch.

28:21.283 --> 28:22.784
Somebody's after you.
Is that it?

28:31.877 --> 28:33.878
What do you suppose he's
telling those cops?

28:36.965 --> 28:39.717
Whatever it is, they
won't believe him.

28:39.802 --> 28:42.804
I worked for a government
agency you never heard of.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.266
They took my son away from me.

28:48.727 --> 28:51.145
They needed him, so
they just took him.

28:53.482 --> 28:55.817
Keep your hand in
your lap, Marty.

28:55.901 --> 28:57.902
It's a frightening power
these people have.

28:57.986 --> 29:00.780
They can make anybody
disappear anytime.

29:00.864 --> 29:02.365
Somebody's gotta stop 'em.

29:02.491 --> 29:04.284
Yeah, well, that's right,
and if you don't mind

29:04.285 --> 29:06.077
my making a suggestion,
maybe we can help.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.246
Yeah. You see, Peter,
Marty and myself...

29:08.330 --> 29:10.531
have had a lot of experience
dealing with... you know...

29:10.624 --> 29:11.625
People who like kicking
other people around.

29:11.626 --> 29:12.625
Yeah, harassing them.

29:12.709 --> 29:14.669
- I got an idea.
- Hey, that's a terrific idea, Marty.

29:14.753 --> 29:16.421
- Why don't we stop for some coffee?
- Don't stop!

29:16.505 --> 29:18.089
Let's get the hell
off this drive!

29:18.173 --> 29:19.841
We're like sitting
ducks down here!

29:19.925 --> 29:21.385
All right. Easy, man, easy.
We're on your side.

29:21.386 --> 29:22.845
We're just trying to help.

29:23.011 --> 29:26.264
Chase 1 to Top Guy 1. We've got him
on the lower drive. Do you copy?

29:26.348 --> 29:29.350
Chase 1, copy. We're
right above you.

29:29.435 --> 29:31.936
Two sedans have
been following us.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.439
Standard government issue.

29:34.565 --> 29:36.065
He's right about that.
They... Bob.

29:36.150 --> 29:38.151
- Yes, sir?
- I want you to lose those cars.

29:38.277 --> 29:39.777
- Lose?
- That's right.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.779
Well how do you suppose
I should go about it?

29:41.864 --> 29:43.573
There's a construction site
other side of the bridge.

29:43.657 --> 29:46.951
When we get there, I want you to follow
my instructions exactly, understand?

29:49.163 --> 29:51.164
Bob,

29:51.248 --> 29:53.875
if they can make me disappear,

29:53.959 --> 29:56.127
they can make you disappear too.

29:59.756 --> 30:01.757
Chase cars,

30:02.759 --> 30:05.303
pull up alongside the Cadillac.

30:05.387 --> 30:07.388
Let's find out what
Peter has in mind.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.650
Something's going on here.

30:19.735 --> 30:22.445
Look like feds to you?
Who knows?

30:22.529 --> 30:24.343
Peter, I'm worried about
that gun going off,

30:24.344 --> 30:26.157
you know, by accident,
if we hit a few bumps.

30:26.241 --> 30:27.992
You got something to
worry about there.

30:28.076 --> 30:30.203
You say across the bridge
when the light changes?

30:30.287 --> 30:32.663
We're not gonna wait for
the lights to change, Bob.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.502
We're not?

30:37.586 --> 30:40.338
Go!

30:53.977 --> 30:58.022
Oh, God. Please, God, don't let
anything happen to my new car.

30:58.106 --> 31:00.483
Chase 1 to Top Guy 1. He's
crossing bridge into fog.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.068
Losing visual contact. Over.

31:10.786 --> 31:12.411
They're finished.

31:12.496 --> 31:15.623
Let's go home. That
son of a bitch.

31:29.012 --> 31:30.513
Hey, watch where you're going.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.474
I can't see anything
in this soup.

31:33.600 --> 31:36.352
- Which way?
- I don't know.

31:36.478 --> 31:38.398
- You go straight, and I'll go left.
- All right.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.842
Now what?

32:07.926 --> 32:09.427
Don't know.

32:11.221 --> 32:12.722
Hear anything?

32:14.016 --> 32:15.975
I don't know.

32:16.101 --> 32:19.937
- Do you?
- Yeah. I definitely hear something.

32:26.028 --> 32:28.529
Chase 1, Chase 1. We're
in pursuit of the Caddy.

32:41.543 --> 32:43.210
I see him.

32:44.212 --> 32:46.092
I see him. He's over there.
Around to the right!

33:05.275 --> 33:07.610
Jesus.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.487
How the hell was I suppo...

33:15.160 --> 33:18.412
There they are. Come on!
Go on! Get moving!

33:48.276 --> 33:51.153
All right. Get
out, both of you.

33:51.238 --> 33:53.698
Leave the motor running.

33:53.782 --> 33:55.866
I can't believe it.
Not a scratch.

33:55.951 --> 33:57.618
Throw your pieces in the lake.

33:59.955 --> 34:02.581
What are you gonna
do now, Peter?

34:16.263 --> 34:17.888
When you see Childress,

34:17.973 --> 34:20.181
ask him if it was
worth his arm.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.393
What happened to
his arm, Peter?

34:22.476 --> 34:26.313
I killed it, with
a machine gun.

34:26.398 --> 34:29.692
- Hey, Peter, now, wait.
- Tell Childress to follow me!

34:31.527 --> 34:34.405
I want him to follow
me this time!

34:34.489 --> 34:36.239
Not in my car, man.

34:37.324 --> 34:38.722
Watch out, Bob!

34:38.723 --> 34:40.119
Hey. Wait. No, Peter!
Let's talk about this!

35:23.413 --> 35:25.790
Gillian, I know you're
upset, but it's silly.

35:25.874 --> 35:28.626
I was told Cheryl has a
history of nosebleeds.

35:28.710 --> 35:31.212
An ice pack stopped the
bleeding in five minutes.

35:31.296 --> 35:34.298
But what I'm trying to tell
you is I made it happen.

35:34.382 --> 35:36.217
Oh, that's impossible.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.502
Look, now, Mother, what about
when you started bleeding?

35:38.553 --> 35:40.137
Remember, a couple
of weeks ago?

35:40.263 --> 35:41.983
I mean, you said yourself
that cut was healed,

35:41.984 --> 35:43.703
and it opened right up.
I mean... Don't!

35:45.227 --> 35:46.727
Why not?

35:48.063 --> 35:49.730
'Cause it could happen to you.

35:52.150 --> 35:54.527
Gillian, I've had a long
flight, and I'm very tired.

35:54.611 --> 35:57.988
And I want you to stop
carrying on like this.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.698
Don't be mad at me.

35:59.783 --> 36:01.534
Sweetheart, I'm not.

36:02.828 --> 36:05.246
I always thought we could
tell each other anything.

36:05.330 --> 36:07.373
Anything, no matter what.

36:07.457 --> 36:09.124
We can.

36:09.209 --> 36:13.629
Mother, I love you,
but I'm afraid.

36:13.755 --> 36:16.549
Afraid to let me touch you?
Yes.

36:18.510 --> 36:22.179
Honey, I'm home, and I'll stay
here just as long as you need me.

36:22.264 --> 36:24.682
I promise.

36:24.766 --> 36:28.227
But what we really should
do now is talk to someone.

36:28.311 --> 36:31.146
And Steve Brenneman has had wonderful
success working with therapy...

36:31.231 --> 36:33.274
Mother, I'm not going
to a psychiatrist.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.215
Hello?

37:00.510 --> 37:03.178
Oh, it's you.

37:04.806 --> 37:08.225
Oh, that was a good one.
Really passionate.

37:08.310 --> 37:12.104
I... I need...

37:12.188 --> 37:13.522
I'm...

37:13.607 --> 37:16.442
Listen, I'm a nurse, and
if my phone's tied up...

37:16.526 --> 37:18.277
and they can't get
hold of me...

37:20.238 --> 37:22.448
So maybe you could breathe
for someone else tonight.

37:23.366 --> 37:24.700
I...

37:24.784 --> 37:27.745
I need... I need... I...

37:27.829 --> 37:30.831
I need your body, baby!

37:31.708 --> 37:34.501
Come on, baby, it's me!

37:34.586 --> 37:37.046
Oh. Oh, my God.

37:43.678 --> 37:46.055
Why do we always have
to meet in this van?

37:46.139 --> 37:48.098
Couldn't we go to my
place just this once?

37:48.183 --> 37:49.683
Too dangerous.

37:50.518 --> 37:52.728
Well, for the sake of argument,

37:52.812 --> 37:56.106
let's assume that everybody
at the institute...

37:56.191 --> 37:58.442
has their phones tapped.

37:58.526 --> 38:00.819
But nobody's watching
me, for heaven's sakes.

38:00.904 --> 38:02.821
They're always watching.

38:02.906 --> 38:04.615
Raymond Dunwoodie
was a psychic,

38:04.699 --> 38:07.284
and if he'd had enough time,
he'd have found Robin for me.

38:07.369 --> 38:08.869
But Childress was watching him.

38:08.954 --> 38:12.164
How else you think
they got to me?

38:12.248 --> 38:14.041
Why are you so
afraid of this guy?

38:14.125 --> 38:17.044
I'm not afraid of Childress.
He's afraid of me.

38:17.128 --> 38:19.380
He knows I'll get my son back.

38:19.464 --> 38:21.966
Now, what about those files?

38:22.050 --> 38:23.926
I'm nobody. I just work there.

38:24.010 --> 38:27.846
I don't have access
to any vital secrets.

38:27.931 --> 38:30.975
You mean you didn't get a chance
to examine the files at Paragon?

38:32.560 --> 38:34.645
- Yes, I did.
- And?

38:36.856 --> 38:38.524
Robin is...

38:40.735 --> 38:42.236
Well, he's...

38:42.988 --> 38:44.613
Dead.

38:46.032 --> 38:49.076
- According to the records...
- Of course that's what the records say.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.828
Childress keeps the records.

38:50.912 --> 38:52.746
What if it's true?

38:52.831 --> 38:54.832
Hester, look at me.

38:54.916 --> 38:57.918
I'm proof-proof that
my son is alive,

38:58.003 --> 39:01.255
or else why would Childress
be so anxious to put me away?

39:04.801 --> 39:07.136
Well, thank God I'm somewhere.

39:09.222 --> 39:11.223
You're the only one
who can help me.

40:04.319 --> 40:08.405
How long did you
follow me around...

40:08.490 --> 40:10.657
before taking a chance on me?

40:11.701 --> 40:14.078
Too long.

40:19.626 --> 40:22.002
Well, thanks.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.839
Thanks for picking me.

40:29.427 --> 40:32.513
You know what, Hester? You don't
realize how beautiful you really are.

40:47.487 --> 40:49.279
Somewhere,

40:49.364 --> 40:51.824
they're doing a hell of
a lot of research...

40:53.910 --> 40:56.578
much more complicated
than Paragon.

41:00.708 --> 41:03.544
God only knows what
they're doing to my son.

41:07.048 --> 41:08.966
Peter,

41:09.050 --> 41:11.301
if Robin is still...

41:11.386 --> 41:14.555
Well, I promise I'll do everything
I can to help find Robin.

41:14.639 --> 41:16.557
But you take too
much for granted.

41:16.641 --> 41:19.268
You trust too many people.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.778
Paragon Institute.

41:29.863 --> 41:32.531
Sounds like a haven for quacks.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.491
But their references are good.

41:34.576 --> 41:37.077
Hey, it's right up
there on the left.

41:38.830 --> 41:41.248
Gil, the more I think about
it, the more I'm convinced...

41:41.332 --> 41:43.834
this is not an appropriate
course of action.

41:43.918 --> 41:46.378
Mother, I like Dr. Lindstrom.

41:46.462 --> 41:48.589
Anyway, I'm old enough
to know what I'm doing.

41:53.761 --> 41:57.181
Well, I don't intend to
let you stay here...

41:57.265 --> 41:59.141
until they've answered
a lot of questions,

41:59.267 --> 42:01.518
- and I mean that, Gillian.
- Okay.

42:02.562 --> 42:04.062
- Hi, Gillian.
- Hi.

42:04.147 --> 42:05.606
- Mrs. Bellaver.
- Yes.

42:05.732 --> 42:07.191
I'm Ellen Lindstrom.
How do you do?

42:07.275 --> 42:08.859
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.278
Dr. McKeever is busy
monitoring a test,

42:11.362 --> 42:13.864
but he should be
with us shortly.

42:13.948 --> 42:15.574
Maybe you'd like
to look around.

42:15.658 --> 42:17.159
Thank you.

42:21.998 --> 42:24.541
I've been here before.

42:24.626 --> 42:26.418
This was Babe Gifford's house.

42:26.502 --> 42:28.837
Yes. We bought the house
from the Giffords.

42:28.922 --> 42:30.547
It was so beautifully furnished.

42:30.632 --> 42:33.508
We tried to make as few
alterations as possible.

42:33.593 --> 42:36.720
As a matter of fact, Gillian's
suite is particularly attractive.

42:36.804 --> 42:39.181
I don't understand why you
want Gillian to stay here.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.225
That was my idea,
Mrs. Bellaver.

42:41.309 --> 42:43.185
Gillian and Catherine Bellaver,

42:43.311 --> 42:45.103
- this is our director, Jim McKeever.
- Mrs. Bellaver.

42:45.188 --> 42:47.231
How do you do?

42:47.357 --> 42:49.066
- Gillian.
- Hi.

42:50.318 --> 42:52.487
We have young people staying
with us all the time

42:52.488 --> 42:54.655
while they help with our
evaluation program.

42:54.739 --> 42:56.406
Thanks, Ellie.

42:56.491 --> 42:58.825
We can do a better job of
judging psychic ability...

42:58.910 --> 43:01.078
if there's a minimum
of distractions.

43:01.162 --> 43:03.830
Of course, it's not
all work and no play.

43:03.915 --> 43:07.876
There's a good library right here
and a game room down the hall.

43:07.961 --> 43:09.670
Do you play
backgammon, Gillian?

43:09.754 --> 43:11.255
- Yeah.
- Good.

43:11.339 --> 43:14.258
And our housekeeper is the
best Irish cook in Chicago,

43:14.342 --> 43:16.593
I'm sorry to say.

43:16.678 --> 43:19.930
I'd like to know what kind of program
you're talking about, Doctor.

43:20.014 --> 43:23.183
Oh, certainly. Why don't we have
a look at one of our workshops?

43:28.356 --> 43:31.608
Telepathy is a timeless
form of communication.

43:31.693 --> 43:35.737
Now, my five-year-old daughter
was very good at this.

43:35.822 --> 43:37.906
But the older and more
sophisticated we become,

43:37.991 --> 43:41.326
the more we rationalize what
our senses try to tell us.

43:45.415 --> 43:48.000
Is this all Gillian
will be doing?

43:48.084 --> 43:51.962
Yes. This and similar tests
under my personal supervision.

43:52.046 --> 43:54.464
We'll take very good care
of her, Mrs. Bellaver.

43:54.549 --> 43:56.133
I'll be fine. Don't worry.

43:56.217 --> 43:58.218
And I'll see you in a
couple of weeks, okay?

43:59.137 --> 44:01.555
Well, all right, but I'll call
you the minute I get to Paris.

44:01.681 --> 44:03.412
And you know where I'm staying
in case you change your mind.

44:03.413 --> 44:05.142
Mother, I'll be fine.

44:05.226 --> 44:06.727
Good-bye.

44:08.271 --> 44:09.813
Good-bye. Good-bye,
Mrs. Bellaver.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.356
Nice meeting you.

44:11.482 --> 44:14.151
Good-bye, Gillian.
Have a good trip.

44:18.990 --> 44:22.242
Oh, my God. It's beautiful.

44:22.327 --> 44:24.161
Do you like it?

44:24.245 --> 44:26.371
Geez, look at this.

44:26.456 --> 44:28.498
It's great!

44:31.044 --> 44:32.919
I got my own stereo.
I'll start unpacking.

44:33.046 --> 44:34.964
You just look around, make
yourself comfortable.

44:34.965 --> 44:36.882
This is beautiful.

44:36.966 --> 44:39.009
"Paragon." That's the
best there is, right?

44:39.093 --> 44:43.180
Something that can't be equaled, like
the incredible power of the human mind.

44:44.515 --> 44:47.267
We hope you'll learn to use that
power to develop your gift.

44:47.352 --> 44:49.102
It's not a gift.

44:49.187 --> 44:52.397
It's more like having a bad tooth and
never knowing when it's gonna hurt.

44:52.523 --> 44:56.234
That's because a part of the
mind you've never used before...

44:56.319 --> 44:58.111
becomes sensitized.

44:58.237 --> 45:01.448
Sensitized to what? The
bioplasmic universe.

45:01.532 --> 45:03.700
Come again?

45:03.785 --> 45:06.578
The bioplasmic universe.

45:06.662 --> 45:08.497
And in that universe
is a record...

45:08.581 --> 45:12.542
of every human impulse,
word and deed...

45:12.627 --> 45:15.629
of lives past and
lives to come.

45:17.298 --> 45:21.051
Occasionally, you make a...
a connection...

45:21.135 --> 45:23.053
between the timeless world...

45:23.137 --> 45:25.097
and the physical world.

45:25.181 --> 45:28.558
You have what clairvoyants
call "a vision."

45:28.643 --> 45:30.268
Yeah, but it's never
about me though.

45:30.353 --> 45:32.687
I mean, I never see
anything about me.

45:34.273 --> 45:35.941
So I'm glad I don't.

45:46.911 --> 45:49.579
Which one is me?

45:49.664 --> 45:51.998
Mine just keeps drifting along.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.209
Hester!

45:54.293 --> 45:56.920
Quit shooting me.

46:00.007 --> 46:01.633
This is great.

47:15.666 --> 47:18.877
I've been thinking. We
should have a little treat.

47:18.961 --> 47:20.504
Just for ourselves.

47:20.630 --> 47:23.798
- Like what?
- Hot fudge sundaes.

47:23.883 --> 47:25.634
Vanilla and chocolate
ice cream.

47:25.760 --> 47:28.803
- Hester.
- Bananas, maraschino cherries.

47:28.888 --> 47:31.598
Coconut, strawberry topping.

47:31.724 --> 47:34.434
- Whipped cream all over the top.
- No. Stop.

47:34.519 --> 47:36.311
Ta-da!

47:36.437 --> 47:40.023
Oh, my God. You guys!

47:41.108 --> 47:42.567
If I don't finish these
tests pretty soon,

47:42.652 --> 47:45.654
I'm gonna get so fat you're gonna
have to roll me out of here.

47:45.780 --> 47:48.114
- Well, have fun.
- Thanks.

47:48.241 --> 47:50.575
Come on. You've earned it.

47:50.701 --> 47:53.203
You're right. What the...

47:53.287 --> 47:55.205
Besides, what are
you talking about?

47:55.331 --> 47:57.332
You look terrific.
Not after this.

47:57.458 --> 48:00.001
- You have a boyfriend?
- No. No one special.

48:00.086 --> 48:02.712
What about you? Pretty
slim pickings around here.

48:02.797 --> 48:06.383
Yeah, Paragon is just a job.

48:06.467 --> 48:08.635
Well, do you have a boyfriend?

48:08.719 --> 48:10.637
Have I got a boyfriend!

48:10.721 --> 48:12.472
What is he like?

48:12.557 --> 48:14.975
Well, he's very charming.

48:15.059 --> 48:18.311
He swept me right off
my feet, in the park.

48:18.396 --> 48:19.896
In the park?

48:19.981 --> 48:22.148
Yeah. He picked me
up in the park.

48:22.233 --> 48:23.900
What was his line?

48:25.528 --> 48:28.238
H-He said he needed help.

48:28.322 --> 48:29.906
Some line.

48:29.991 --> 48:32.075
What are you talking about?
It worked.

48:32.159 --> 48:34.327
True. What does he do?

48:34.412 --> 48:35.870
Do?

48:35.955 --> 48:39.457
Oh, he-he travels around a lot.

48:39.542 --> 48:41.459
Where?

48:41.544 --> 48:44.170
Oh, all over.

48:44.255 --> 48:46.298
You know.

48:46.382 --> 48:50.218
Oh, when he comes to town, we go to...
parties.

48:50.303 --> 48:52.512
He loves people.

48:52.597 --> 48:55.098
He takes me out dancing,

48:55.182 --> 48:57.392
buys me presents.

48:57.476 --> 49:00.562
Oh, he dresses beautifully,
and he's a good dancer.

49:00.646 --> 49:02.147
Yeah?

49:03.691 --> 49:05.775
The only trouble is,

49:05.860 --> 49:08.194
he's very hard to get hold of.

49:10.364 --> 49:12.699
Oh, come on. Let's dig in.

49:13.701 --> 49:16.536
You mean gross out.
Look at this.

49:23.711 --> 49:26.254
And when I was your age, I
had one great ambition.

49:26.339 --> 49:28.632
- What?
- To be Fred Astaire.

49:28.716 --> 49:30.300
Oh, my God.

49:30.384 --> 49:32.594
As you can see, I
failed miserably.

49:32.720 --> 49:34.929
Well, I took dance for
a couple of years.

49:35.014 --> 49:36.973
Yes. My mother insisted.

49:37.058 --> 49:39.267
You see, she didn't think
I was any too graceful.

50:28.567 --> 50:30.777
Don't-Don't touch me anymore.

50:32.154 --> 50:34.906
Please don't touch me.

50:34.990 --> 50:36.241
Oh, God!

50:38.619 --> 50:40.120
God!

50:40.204 --> 50:41.788
What happened?

51:07.022 --> 51:09.065
Tomorrow, we do
some real testing,

51:09.150 --> 51:12.694
make things as challenging
as possible for Gillian.

51:12.778 --> 51:16.531
Nelson, as soon as Gillian begins to
demonstrate her psychometric talents,

51:16.615 --> 51:19.743
I want complete audio and
videotape records of the tests.

51:19.827 --> 51:21.828
Will she be working
in the Faraday cage?

51:21.912 --> 51:24.789
No, no, no. This girl's not a cheat.
She's the real thing.

51:26.167 --> 51:27.667
Now,

51:29.837 --> 51:32.213
do we have any
bleeders in the group?

51:32.298 --> 51:34.299
No.

51:34.383 --> 51:37.343
Anyone who's had even minor
surgery in the past three months?

51:37.428 --> 51:39.429
No, sir.

51:39.513 --> 51:41.514
How about ulcers?

51:43.601 --> 51:46.978
Hester, Kristen, Lorraine,

51:47.104 --> 51:48.689
if you girls are into
your monthlies, I don't

51:48.690 --> 51:50.273
want you around when
Gillian is testing.

51:50.357 --> 51:52.609
Are you serious?

51:52.693 --> 51:54.194
I'm very serious.

51:54.278 --> 51:56.738
Gillian's power to
psychometrize is spontaneous.

51:56.822 --> 52:00.408
She creates an enormously
powerful electromagnetic field.

52:00.493 --> 52:03.119
Almost everyone exposed
to it will bleed.

52:03.204 --> 52:05.205
Some will bleed a little,

52:05.289 --> 52:06.790
some a lot.

52:06.874 --> 52:09.334
What is this kid, a vampire?

52:09.418 --> 52:11.711
Do you want to
continue working here?

52:11.796 --> 52:14.839
Then I don't want to hear any
more funny remarks like that!

52:14.965 --> 52:17.133
How do you account for it?
We can't account for it.

52:17.218 --> 52:18.718
Not yet.

52:30.606 --> 52:33.274
Gillian, can you hear me?

52:33.359 --> 52:36.152
Jim, it takes a few moments for
the Evapil to take effect.

52:36.237 --> 52:37.904
Ellie, please.

52:39.907 --> 52:41.908
Gillian,

52:41.992 --> 52:43.827
what did you see on the stairs?

52:45.663 --> 52:47.163
A boy.

52:48.916 --> 52:50.416
Robin.

52:57.758 --> 52:59.926
Have you seen him before?

53:04.390 --> 53:05.890
Yeah.

53:07.518 --> 53:08.852
I have.

53:12.356 --> 53:15.900
Gillian and Robin were
in touch telepathically.

53:15.985 --> 53:18.403
Think of what we would
accomplish if Robin were alive.

53:18.529 --> 53:20.780
- I'm sending her home.
- Jim.

53:22.199 --> 53:23.533
Why?

53:23.617 --> 53:25.660
Because I don't want to be
responsible for Gillian Bellaver.

53:25.786 --> 53:27.392
I don't think you mean...

53:27.393 --> 53:28.997
Ellie, I don't want to
talk about it anymore!

53:36.714 --> 53:38.214
It's late.

53:41.802 --> 53:43.803
And we're both overexcited.

53:47.892 --> 53:49.809
Listen, I don't
understand something.

53:50.603 --> 53:53.271
This is a marvelous
opportunity for us.

53:54.565 --> 53:56.649
We only had Robin
for a few days,

53:56.734 --> 53:59.235
but I think that Gillian
really wants to work with us,

53:59.320 --> 54:04.073
and she is the best subject for
psychic research I have ever seen.

54:05.659 --> 54:07.160
Ellie,

54:08.662 --> 54:12.081
even the most backward tribes, the
most primitive cultures on earth,

54:12.166 --> 54:14.959
would welcome the birth
of a Robin Sandza.

54:15.044 --> 54:17.128
And in time, he'd
become their magician,

54:17.212 --> 54:19.422
their prophet, their
great healer.

54:19.506 --> 54:22.300
But there is no place for
these kids in our culture...

54:22.384 --> 54:25.386
because they're so superior
to what we hold sacred.

54:28.307 --> 54:30.475
And what a culture
can't assimilate,

54:31.602 --> 54:33.102
it destroys.

54:33.187 --> 54:35.605
Jim, what really happened
to Robin Sandza?

54:39.568 --> 54:42.946
He was running on the
steps, taking them...

54:43.030 --> 54:45.448
two or three at a
time, and he...

54:48.619 --> 54:50.954
slipped, went
through the window.

54:51.038 --> 54:52.455
But why was he running?

54:53.332 --> 54:55.375
I don't know, Ellie.
I wasn't here.

55:07.513 --> 55:09.013
Jim.

55:13.519 --> 55:16.646
Why don't you come
up to my place?

55:16.730 --> 55:18.648
I mean, I'll scramble
some eggs...

55:18.732 --> 55:20.233
No. I'm...

55:21.860 --> 55:23.569
I'm gonna finish this.

55:26.740 --> 55:28.992
Then I'm gonna...

55:29.076 --> 55:32.161
stretch out on the couch
for a couple of hours.

55:34.623 --> 55:37.750
What time is it? My
watch has stopped.

55:40.337 --> 55:42.338
It's a quarter after 4:00.

55:44.049 --> 55:45.925
Excuse me.

55:48.887 --> 55:50.555
It's later than I thought.

55:54.977 --> 55:56.477
Thanks, Ellie.

56:04.611 --> 56:06.112
Well,

56:09.616 --> 56:11.117
good night, Jim.

56:51.658 --> 56:53.367
Morning.

57:02.086 --> 57:04.587
What do you want?

57:04.671 --> 57:06.923
My arm hurts.

57:07.007 --> 57:08.508
It's dead.

57:09.551 --> 57:12.178
Why should it still hurt?

57:12.262 --> 57:14.931
You're the brain expert,

57:15.015 --> 57:17.433
so tell me.

57:17.518 --> 57:19.894
Is it all in my head, Doctor?

57:19.978 --> 57:22.980
That's an oversimplification,

57:23.065 --> 57:26.192
but there's nothing I can do.

57:26.276 --> 57:28.277
That's not why I came here.

57:30.280 --> 57:32.615
Tell me about Gillian Bellaver.

57:35.035 --> 57:37.537
My people always know
what's going on here,

57:38.539 --> 57:41.207
even if you're slow
to keep me informed.

57:42.292 --> 57:45.294
Will the girl be
another Robin Sandza?

57:47.589 --> 57:49.382
- No.
- Really?

57:51.218 --> 57:53.219
Poor Peter.

57:54.429 --> 57:57.598
If he only knew that Robin
doesn't care anymore...

57:57.683 --> 58:00.560
doesn't care if his
father's alive or dead.

58:02.062 --> 58:03.688
What the hell have you
done to that boy?

58:03.772 --> 58:05.815
Oh, he's being treated
like a prince.

58:05.899 --> 58:07.817
He is. He's royalty. Unique.

58:07.901 --> 58:11.654
Chinese don't have one.
Soviets don't have one.

58:11.738 --> 58:14.657
In all the world, there's no
one quite like Robin Sandza...

58:16.076 --> 58:17.577
unless it's this girl.

58:18.912 --> 58:22.081
How can you hold him against his
will and get any kind of results?

58:22.166 --> 58:24.375
Against his will?

58:24.459 --> 58:27.128
You don't understand
Robin's needs.

58:27.212 --> 58:28.713
We do.

58:34.595 --> 58:36.846
Are you testing the girl today?

58:36.930 --> 58:39.348
She's... failed every test.
She's a fake.

58:39.433 --> 58:41.684
I'm sending her home. I don't
have time to waste on people...

58:41.768 --> 58:44.729
Don't do that to me, Doctor.

58:44.813 --> 58:47.148
Don't ever try lying to me.

58:51.111 --> 58:54.739
For God's sakes, she's just a child.
She doesn't know anything.

58:54.823 --> 58:57.241
She has no control
over what she's doing.

58:58.785 --> 59:01.704
Robin had no control
when he came here.

59:01.788 --> 59:03.706
Just raw ability.

59:05.042 --> 59:09.045
Doctor, I wish you
could see him now.

59:11.965 --> 59:13.549
For God's sakes.

59:13.634 --> 59:17.470
I want you to get yourself together.
Stop fudging your responsibilities.

59:19.181 --> 59:21.641
This girl is important to me.

59:24.895 --> 59:26.896
I'm assigning extra security.

59:28.649 --> 59:30.191
Why?

59:30.275 --> 59:33.861
If I know Peter, he penetrated
your security weeks ago.

59:33.946 --> 59:36.239
He probably knows I
have Gillian Bellaver.

59:37.658 --> 59:40.243
I don't know who his
confederate is,

59:41.328 --> 59:43.412
but I'm looking into it.

01:00:08.939 --> 01:00:10.439
She's all right.

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:12.108
Try that one.

01:00:12.192 --> 01:00:14.443
I will, I will.

01:00:20.367 --> 01:00:22.285
Kristen, where's Dr. McKeever?

01:00:22.369 --> 01:00:25.788
Oh, he's down at Medtronics, checking
out the new testing equipment.

01:00:25.872 --> 01:00:27.540
Do you know when he'll be back?

01:00:27.624 --> 01:00:29.166
He said not before dinner.

01:00:29.293 --> 01:00:31.294
Where's Gillian?
Having breakfast.

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:34.171
I could use a cup
of coffee myself.

01:00:44.975 --> 01:00:46.225
A club.

01:00:51.356 --> 01:00:52.773
Good morning, Gillian.

01:00:52.899 --> 01:00:56.736
You're not eating much.
I'm not very hungry.

01:00:59.156 --> 01:01:02.241
Did you hear what
happened yesterday?

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:04.910
Dr. McKeever's hand
started bleeding.

01:01:06.663 --> 01:01:08.998
Yes, I do know about that.

01:01:09.082 --> 01:01:11.709
Well, what are you
gonna do about it?

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:13.711
I mean, it's why I'm
here, isn't it?

01:01:13.795 --> 01:01:17.006
I mean, can't anybody help me?

01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:20.760
Gillian, we have
to work together.

01:01:25.807 --> 01:01:27.308
Gillian,

01:01:29.853 --> 01:01:32.104
do you remember much of what
we talked about last night?

01:01:33.940 --> 01:01:35.232
Last night?

01:01:37.235 --> 01:01:41.030
- Were you here last night, Dr. Lindstrom?
- That's right.

01:01:41.114 --> 01:01:42.698
While you were
with Dr. McKeever,

01:01:42.783 --> 01:01:44.533
you had some sort of
vision that upset you.

01:01:44.618 --> 01:01:46.452
You were in a fugue
state for a while.

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:49.705
We gave you something
to help you relax,

01:01:49.790 --> 01:01:51.833
and I made the suggestion
that you consciously

01:01:51.834 --> 01:01:53.876
forget whatever was
troubling you.

01:01:53.960 --> 01:01:58.214
And, apparently, it worked
better than I thought.

01:02:00.550 --> 01:02:03.719
So, you don't remember
anything about Robin Sandza?

01:02:05.472 --> 01:02:07.973
No. Who's Robin Sandza?

01:02:09.142 --> 01:02:11.685
He's a boy your age...

01:02:11.770 --> 01:02:13.270
with powers like yours.

01:02:15.357 --> 01:02:18.901
Like me? Well, where is he?

01:02:18.985 --> 01:02:21.612
I mean, do you think
I could talk to him?

01:02:34.376 --> 01:02:35.876
Do you know him?

01:02:36.962 --> 01:02:38.963
I feel like I do.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:42.091
What can you tell me about him?

01:02:51.268 --> 01:02:52.768
He's...

01:02:54.438 --> 01:02:56.689
It's not very clear. He's...

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.986
He's, like, dreaming or...

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:07.199
not... awake yet.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:13.456
Drugged.

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:15.541
Stop!

01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.128
Just relax, Robin. Relax.

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:20.963
It's gonna be okay.

01:03:21.965 --> 01:03:24.550
Gillian, where are you?

01:03:26.887 --> 01:03:29.638
Get that light off him.

01:03:29.723 --> 01:03:33.642
Disturbance in the magnetic
field on the last P.K.

01:03:33.727 --> 01:03:36.438
Trial was to cast a character
with a parametrical

01:03:36.439 --> 01:03:39.148
resonance on a frequency
of five cycles.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:41.859
We'll go for a
magnetometer check now.

01:03:41.943 --> 01:03:44.153
The infrared area scanning
system is operational.

01:03:44.237 --> 01:03:47.239
With this trial, we want a two-dimensional
view of the field potentials.

01:03:47.324 --> 01:03:50.159
We have a mild electrostatic
field fluctuation.

01:03:50.243 --> 01:03:53.162
We have differentiation between
the "P" and "T" waves.

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:55.164
Heart action
slightly arrhythmic.

01:03:55.248 --> 01:03:58.000
Let me have that electrogram
reading again, please.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:01.170
Pulse, 66. Pressure,
114 over 92.

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:08.677
Pulse steady at 67.
Pressure, 115 over 94.

01:04:08.762 --> 01:04:11.388
Robin, we're going
to show you a film.

01:04:11.473 --> 01:04:15.351
Now, there's nothing in there
that can possibly harm you,

01:04:15.435 --> 01:04:19.230
but you must keep
watching, okay?

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.858
Pulse beginning to rise, 73.

01:04:22.943 --> 01:04:25.402
Pressure, 115 over 94.

01:04:28.031 --> 01:04:30.199
Magnetometer holding at 640.

01:04:30.283 --> 01:04:33.410
Pulse is 78. Pressure,
129 over 111.

01:04:33.495 --> 01:04:35.162
No. Keep watching.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:36.914
Keep watching.

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:40.125
We have a mild electrostatic
field fluctuation.

01:04:41.211 --> 01:04:43.546
Body temperature, 89.59.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.214
Pulse steady at 65.

01:04:45.298 --> 01:04:47.550
Robin, please, keep watching.

01:04:47.634 --> 01:04:50.261
Heartbeat, brain, relative to
force field fluctuation in ratio.

01:04:50.345 --> 01:04:52.888
No! No!

01:04:52.973 --> 01:04:55.266
Robin, please, for God's
sake, watch the screen.

01:04:55.350 --> 01:04:56.809
- Gillian!
- Slight increase in activity...

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:57.601
Gillian!

01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:00.062
Where is Robin now, Gillian?

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:11.323
My Dad! They're after my Dad!

01:05:17.372 --> 01:05:18.831
Dad!

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:21.125
No!

01:06:05.879 --> 01:06:06.837
Hester!

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:09.131
Oh, my God.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:11.550
Oh, my God, listen.

01:06:11.635 --> 01:06:13.469
I need to talk to my mother.

01:06:13.553 --> 01:06:15.262
Do you think I could
call my mother?

01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:17.348
You can talk to your
Mom in a little while,

01:06:17.432 --> 01:06:20.476
but you've had an awful
shock, and you need to rest.

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:22.394
- Here.
- What... What is that?

01:06:22.479 --> 01:06:24.980
It's a sedative.
It's like aspirin.

01:06:25.065 --> 01:06:27.316
You take aspirin, don't you?

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.360
Here's some water.

01:06:30.904 --> 01:06:33.155
Drink plenty of water.

01:06:33.239 --> 01:06:34.782
Oh, that's a good girl.

01:06:34.908 --> 01:06:37.534
- I need to see Dr. McKeever.
- Sure.

01:06:37.619 --> 01:06:39.119
I have to know what
happened to Ellen.

01:06:39.204 --> 01:06:41.330
They'll be here in a little while.
Just...

01:06:41.414 --> 01:06:44.166
I'll stay here with you.
Just lie down and-and relax.

01:06:44.250 --> 01:06:46.293
No, no. I gotta
get out of here.

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:49.004
- I gotta go... home.
- It's all right, Gillian.

01:06:49.089 --> 01:06:52.174
Everything will be all right. We'll
take good care of you. Now don't worry.

01:06:56.179 --> 01:06:59.932
Ellen's X-rays were encouraging. She's
beginning to show signs of consciousness.

01:07:04.396 --> 01:07:06.605
It had to be a cerebral hemorrhage,
something in the brain.

01:07:06.690 --> 01:07:08.399
She's a fake.

01:07:08.483 --> 01:07:10.818
You were gonna send her home.

01:07:11.986 --> 01:07:15.155
Is that the kind of cooperation
I can expect, Doctor?

01:07:18.368 --> 01:07:22.287
I want Gillian Bellaver at the P.S.
I. Facility tomorrow.

01:07:22.372 --> 01:07:25.666
Do we let her mother know? She's wealthy.
She has powerful friends.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.376
Gillian can't just dis...

01:08:55.465 --> 01:08:57.508
Peter, it's impossible.

01:08:57.591 --> 01:09:00.135
I'll never be able to get
that girl out of that place.

01:09:00.220 --> 01:09:01.804
I'll blow it.

01:09:01.888 --> 01:09:06.809
Getting out of Paragon is a hell
of a lot easier than getting in.

01:09:06.935 --> 01:09:09.812
What do I say to Gillian?
Tell her everything.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:13.273
Tell her what they did to Robin.
They'll do the same thing to her.

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.859
- What if she won't listen to me?
- Look, I don't have much time.

01:09:15.944 --> 01:09:18.779
That girl can lead me to Robin.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:20.781
Well, she was doped the
last time I saw her.

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:24.868
- Everything is set for tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

01:09:26.830 --> 01:09:29.581
I need your help. Please.

01:11:56.396 --> 01:11:58.397
You feel all right, Robin?

01:12:00.274 --> 01:12:02.693
You know, that wasn't a
very smart thing to do.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:05.237
You could've been
very badly hurt.

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:08.824
Why were you running away?

01:12:11.661 --> 01:12:14.329
I mean, you didn't have to use the window.
There is a door.

01:12:14.414 --> 01:12:18.041
Yeah. Like they'd really let
me just walk out the door.

01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:23.005
Why didn't you come to me?

01:12:23.089 --> 01:12:25.298
'Cause you're one of them.

01:12:26.926 --> 01:12:28.844
I just wanna get out of here.
I hate this place.

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:31.513
Hate these doctors
and the tests.

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:34.016
Driving me crazy. I
can't even sleep.

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:39.021
And you want to get away from me too.
Is that it?

01:12:40.648 --> 01:12:42.899
Well, what do you care?

01:12:42.984 --> 01:12:45.444
I care very much.

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:53.452
What's the matter, Robin?
Don't you trust me anymore?

01:12:56.956 --> 01:12:59.041
I-I don't know.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:09.176
But you do want to get
out of here, don't you?

01:13:10.011 --> 01:13:12.095
Yeah.

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:15.348
All right. Then
we'll go together.

01:13:15.475 --> 01:13:17.809
- Go where?
- Gillian.

01:13:20.313 --> 01:13:22.939
Well, I have this
place in the country,

01:13:23.024 --> 01:13:24.983
north of Chicago in Lakeview.

01:13:25.985 --> 01:13:26.985
Gillian?

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:31.073
You can do whatever you like.
You don't have to see anybody.

01:13:31.157 --> 01:13:33.742
You don't have to
talk to anybody...

01:13:33.826 --> 01:13:35.368
not even me.

01:13:39.332 --> 01:13:40.582
Really?

01:13:42.335 --> 01:13:43.752
Yes, really.

01:13:45.963 --> 01:13:47.506
Would you like to do that?

01:13:49.509 --> 01:13:51.093
Sure.

01:13:51.177 --> 01:13:51.721
Gillian?

01:13:58.351 --> 01:13:59.935
Hi, Hester.

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:03.021
I've been looking
everywhere for you.

01:14:04.107 --> 01:14:06.108
This was Robin's room
when he was here.

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:11.863
Yes, it was.

01:14:13.449 --> 01:14:15.826
He's in terrible trouble now.

01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:17.869
Those people, they should
be trying to help him.

01:14:17.954 --> 01:14:19.955
What people?

01:14:21.541 --> 01:14:23.875
Where Robin is.

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:25.627
But they won't leave him alone.

01:14:25.711 --> 01:14:29.840
I mean, it was like they were
deliberately trying to hurt him.

01:14:31.425 --> 01:14:33.218
- Hester. Don't!
- Wait, wait. Come here.

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:36.388
It's okay. It's okay.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:45.230
I'm not bleeding.

01:14:50.153 --> 01:14:53.822
- You know where Robin is?
- Yeah, I do.

01:14:54.949 --> 01:14:56.575
Would you like to see him?

01:14:57.451 --> 01:15:01.037
I need to see him.

01:15:03.249 --> 01:15:05.959
Well, I think we
can work that out.

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:08.837
How?

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:15.260
Well, Dr. McKeever says I'm
supposed to give these to you...

01:15:15.344 --> 01:15:18.180
to keep you happy and harmless.

01:15:18.264 --> 01:15:20.432
Do you know what I mean?

01:15:20.558 --> 01:15:21.892
No. What...

01:15:21.893 --> 01:15:23.226
So you'll have to pretend
that you took them...

01:15:23.311 --> 01:15:26.104
because I have to get you
out of here tomorrow.

01:15:26.189 --> 01:15:28.607
Otherwise, you could be in
terrible trouble yourself.

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:31.318
What are you saying?
What is going on?

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:34.404
Honey, I've got so
much to tell you.

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:11.274
Would you like a drink?

01:16:12.276 --> 01:16:14.611
You look tired.

01:16:14.695 --> 01:16:16.196
I am tired.

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:20.575
How's our boy wonder?

01:16:20.701 --> 01:16:24.246
Those films of his father's death have
unleashed an incredible emotional force.

01:16:24.330 --> 01:16:27.165
Why, he's developing the
power of an atomic reactor.

01:16:27.250 --> 01:16:29.292
Or an atomic bomb.

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:31.937
What are you giving
him to calm him down?

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:34.965
Every day, he has 3,000
milligrams of phenobarbital...

01:16:35.049 --> 01:16:37.217
and 1,000 milligrams
of Prolixin...

01:16:37.301 --> 01:16:39.844
What the hell are you telling me?
That's enough to kill him.

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:42.430
Drugs no longer have
any effect on him.

01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:45.767
We've pushed him too far.
He's quite unstable.

01:16:45.851 --> 01:16:47.686
He flies into rages
over nothing.

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:49.437
He could be dangerous.

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.442
What's he trying to prove?

01:16:55.361 --> 01:16:59.447
Mentally, Robin has developed this
perfect psychotronic relationship...

01:16:59.532 --> 01:17:01.241
with all kinds of machines.

01:17:01.325 --> 01:17:04.744
And so, naturally, he's trying to do
the same thing now with his body.

01:17:05.705 --> 01:17:08.957
Except that, physically,
he's just adequate,

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:13.128
and when he fails,
he's intolerable.

01:17:13.212 --> 01:17:15.171
How is he performing in bed?

01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:21.052
Robin wants to please me. That's
the main thing, isn't it?

01:17:29.854 --> 01:17:31.604
He needs a rest.

01:17:31.689 --> 01:17:33.982
No more tests for
at least a month.

01:17:34.066 --> 01:17:35.567
Sorry.

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:38.528
He's been under
tremendous pressure.

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:41.114
We plan to get away,
just the two of us.

01:17:41.198 --> 01:17:44.826
No. We almost lost
him once, Susan.

01:17:45.828 --> 01:17:49.622
I promised. I promised him
we'd get away together.

01:17:54.045 --> 01:17:55.545
All right.

01:17:57.131 --> 01:18:00.842
Take him into the city,
show him the sights,

01:18:01.844 --> 01:18:03.845
but get him back
here in 24 hours.

01:18:26.952 --> 01:18:29.287
Well, there you are.

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:32.207
Who are they?

01:18:33.584 --> 01:18:35.377
These are friends of
mine from the institute.

01:18:35.461 --> 01:18:37.754
Are you planning on
seeing them later?

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:43.051
No, Robin. I'm with you.
Remember?

01:18:43.135 --> 01:18:46.137
And which one are you
gonna screw first?

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:51.142
Robin, come here. Come on.

01:18:51.227 --> 01:18:53.603
- Get away from me.
- Robin, please.

01:21:46.819 --> 01:21:48.319
Oh, my God!

01:21:55.661 --> 01:21:58.246
Top Guy 2, this is Top Guy 1.

01:21:58.330 --> 01:22:00.915
Do you have any coffee left?

01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:02.917
Top Guy 1, that's
an affirmative.

01:22:03.002 --> 01:22:05.587
I've got about a cup of
lukewarm coffee left.

01:22:05.671 --> 01:22:08.256
You wanna negotiate a trade?

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:12.760
Top Guy 2, I have one
Hershey bar to trade.

01:22:12.845 --> 01:22:14.596
Top Guy 1, I read you.

01:22:14.680 --> 01:22:16.431
Is that with or
without almonds?

01:22:16.515 --> 01:22:18.600
All right, Asshole
1 and Asshole 2,

01:22:18.684 --> 01:22:20.518
stop cluttering up
this frequency.

01:22:23.689 --> 01:22:25.773
Isn't Dr. McKeever back yet?

01:22:25.858 --> 01:22:28.359
Oh, I'm afraid not, Hester.

01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:30.903
He's still at the
hospital with Ellen.

01:22:30.988 --> 01:22:32.572
Can I help?

01:22:41.999 --> 01:22:45.752
Dr. McKeever prescribed medication
for Gillian this morning,

01:22:45.836 --> 01:22:48.254
but we're all out of it.

01:22:48.339 --> 01:22:53.593
He was very specific about
using a non-barbiturate.

01:22:58.349 --> 01:23:01.351
So, I guess I'd better go
down to the drugstore.

01:23:01.435 --> 01:23:02.935
Fine.

01:23:20.371 --> 01:23:22.622
Hey.

01:23:22.748 --> 01:23:25.291
- Are these ready to be mailed yet?
- Yeah, why?

01:23:25.376 --> 01:23:27.710
I could take them down to
The Post Office for you.

01:23:27.795 --> 01:23:30.213
That would be terrific.

01:23:30.297 --> 01:23:32.048
Oh, I'd really
appreciate that, Hester.

01:23:32.132 --> 01:23:35.051
Here, these go in. These
have to be stamped.

01:23:35.135 --> 01:23:36.761
And that stuff.

01:23:40.974 --> 01:23:42.475
Whoops.

01:23:48.774 --> 01:23:51.401
Here comes the pony express!

01:23:51.485 --> 01:23:53.945
Oh, hi. Will you be gone long?

01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:55.947
Oh, no. I have to go...

01:23:57.700 --> 01:24:01.077
I have to whiz to the drugstore. I
have to whiz to The Post Office.

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:04.205
I have so many things to do,
I'll never get through the day.

01:24:04.289 --> 01:24:07.125
Oh, I'm silly. I can't
go without the card.

01:24:08.502 --> 01:24:11.921
Door card. Where is that card?

01:24:12.005 --> 01:24:14.590
I haven't the vaguest idea.

01:24:14.675 --> 01:24:16.092
How's Gillian?

01:24:16.176 --> 01:24:18.594
She's doing just fine.

01:24:18.679 --> 01:24:20.596
That's good.

01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:21.931
Gillian?

01:24:22.015 --> 01:24:25.935
How about a bacon, lettuce
and tomato sandwich?

01:24:26.019 --> 01:24:27.895
- Okay.
- Good girl.

01:24:52.004 --> 01:24:54.797
Oh, damn.

01:24:54.882 --> 01:24:56.716
Oh, I'll give you a hand.

01:24:56.842 --> 01:24:58.760
- Don't bother. Don't bother.
- It's no bother.

01:24:58.844 --> 01:25:00.678
I can take care of it.
It's okay.

01:25:32.294 --> 01:25:35.004
Oh, for God's sake,
move your ass.

01:25:39.968 --> 01:25:43.221
Oh, I'll get that, Gillian.

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:45.765
Here's some more, Hester.

01:30:25.879 --> 01:30:27.546
I killed her.

01:30:29.549 --> 01:30:33.094
I knew I would the first
time I said hello.

01:30:34.846 --> 01:30:37.056
I conned her into helping me.

01:30:40.560 --> 01:30:42.853
She would have done
anything for me.

01:30:47.859 --> 01:30:50.444
Hey, you better get some sleep.

01:30:50.529 --> 01:30:54.031
Don't stop. Please
keep talking.

01:30:55.325 --> 01:30:58.327
I'm afraid to close my eyes,

01:30:58.411 --> 01:31:01.288
afraid of what I'll see.

01:31:04.084 --> 01:31:06.544
- Sip this.
- I don't want it.

01:31:06.628 --> 01:31:08.629
Sip it. You'll feel better.

01:31:19.891 --> 01:31:22.059
It's the best thing in the
world for a toothache.

01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:31.152
Tell me about Robin.

01:31:34.739 --> 01:31:36.240
You tell me.

01:31:38.994 --> 01:31:41.245
It's just that...

01:31:41.329 --> 01:31:43.581
sometimes I know what's
happening to him,

01:31:45.417 --> 01:31:49.670
what he's... thinking,
what he's feeling.

01:31:51.256 --> 01:31:54.341
I'm... like a receiver,

01:31:54.426 --> 01:31:56.886
and-and Robin sends
me pictures.

01:31:58.638 --> 01:32:00.723
Jesus, that's amazing.

01:32:02.809 --> 01:32:04.727
Like twins.

01:32:07.772 --> 01:32:09.690
He's a good-looking kid.

01:32:12.277 --> 01:32:14.945
You know, you're the kind
of girl Robin would like.

01:32:19.034 --> 01:32:21.702
I raised him myself.

01:32:21.786 --> 01:32:23.621
His mother died at childbirth.

01:32:25.165 --> 01:32:26.916
How come you didn't
marry again?

01:32:28.043 --> 01:32:30.628
Just hasn't been anybody.

01:32:30.712 --> 01:32:32.963
Hester?

01:32:38.637 --> 01:32:40.179
Yeah.

01:32:41.765 --> 01:32:43.265
Hester.

01:32:51.066 --> 01:32:53.984
I'm s...

01:32:56.738 --> 01:32:58.447
Hey.

01:33:08.667 --> 01:33:12.294
Hey, when was the last
time you saw Robin?

01:33:12.379 --> 01:33:14.588
Oh, about 11 months.

01:33:16.925 --> 01:33:19.385
He's been growing up so fast.

01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:26.350
You know, I'm a good
athlete, but he's better.

01:33:27.644 --> 01:33:30.437
The last at the club, we raced
in the pool about 10 laps,

01:33:30.522 --> 01:33:33.440
and he beat me, but
I said, "I won."

01:33:33.525 --> 01:33:35.192
He said, "No, you didn't."
I said, "I did too."

01:33:35.318 --> 01:33:36.965
He said, "No, you didn't!"
He jumped up on the

01:33:36.966 --> 01:33:38.612
side of the pool, got
into a racing dive.

01:33:38.738 --> 01:33:42.283
He said, "All right, we'll do it again.
Twenty laps this time."

01:33:42.367 --> 01:33:46.161
I was... I was so dead I could
hardly drag myself out of the water.

01:33:46.246 --> 01:33:48.998
"All right. You won. You won."

01:33:57.924 --> 01:34:00.342
Tell me, Gillian.

01:34:01.344 --> 01:34:03.012
How is he?

01:34:07.100 --> 01:34:08.559
He's okay.

01:34:12.772 --> 01:34:14.273
Okay.

01:34:16.192 --> 01:34:17.526
Yeah.

01:34:19.321 --> 01:34:21.822
We're all gonna be okay.

01:34:23.908 --> 01:34:25.409
That's a promise.

01:34:42.469 --> 01:34:44.845
Peter!

01:34:44.929 --> 01:34:47.139
Stop! Please, let me off!

01:34:47.223 --> 01:34:50.768
I'm supposed to get off here!

01:34:53.605 --> 01:34:55.105
Peter!

01:34:58.818 --> 01:35:01.362
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- You were gonna leave me!

01:35:01.446 --> 01:35:04.448
Now, look, you got me here.
Now, stay out of this.

01:35:05.492 --> 01:35:08.035
He's my son. It's my fight.

01:35:08.119 --> 01:35:10.204
My God! I don't know
who to trust anymore!

01:35:10.288 --> 01:35:12.539
Look, that bus'll
take you to Seattle.

01:35:12.624 --> 01:35:14.625
I paid the driver.
You'll be safe.

01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:16.585
You can't leave me!

01:35:17.879 --> 01:35:20.214
Get on that bus and stay on it!

01:35:23.468 --> 01:35:24.885
Peter.

01:35:24.969 --> 01:35:27.179
But I can take you to him now.

01:35:27.263 --> 01:35:29.181
Peter, I was lying before.

01:35:29.265 --> 01:35:31.350
Robin's not okay.
He needs us now!

01:35:31.434 --> 01:35:34.103
Look, it's too dangerous.
People around me get killed.

01:35:34.187 --> 01:35:37.064
Well, damn it! People
around me get hurt too!

01:35:37.148 --> 01:35:39.441
I make them bleed!

01:35:39.526 --> 01:35:41.860
Robin can help me!

01:35:41.945 --> 01:35:44.071
Please.

01:36:16.855 --> 01:36:19.773
Oh, Jesus!

01:36:21.359 --> 01:36:22.901
Why did you do that?

01:36:22.986 --> 01:36:25.863
You know I don't like it when you
smell like this stuff, don't you?

01:36:26.698 --> 01:36:29.450
Could you just leave me alone for
a little bit, please, Robin?

01:36:29.534 --> 01:36:32.369
I got tired of waiting for you!
What's taking so long?

01:36:33.872 --> 01:36:35.873
I wanted to have a bath
and a little privacy.

01:36:35.957 --> 01:36:38.125
Well, you're taking
too goddamn long!

01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:41.336
Is everything all
right, Dr. Charles?

01:36:41.421 --> 01:36:43.380
Yes, everything's fine.

01:36:43.465 --> 01:36:45.382
Now, when the others arrive,

01:36:45.467 --> 01:36:48.886
would you just hold them
downstairs for a moment?

01:36:48.970 --> 01:36:50.971
I need a few minutes
in here, okay?

01:36:51.055 --> 01:36:52.723
I'll call you. Thank you.

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:46.420
Robin?

01:38:47.839 --> 01:38:49.339
I'm sorry.

01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:55.345
Try to understand the strain I'm under.
I'm very worried about you.

01:38:58.141 --> 01:39:00.058
Don't be sorry.

01:39:02.520 --> 01:39:05.439
I didn't mean to act
like that in there.

01:39:05.523 --> 01:39:07.024
It's me.

01:39:09.986 --> 01:39:12.112
I'm okay now, though.

01:39:13.698 --> 01:39:16.325
- I'm okay.
- Good.

01:39:19.495 --> 01:39:22.289
Well, I'm starved. You want
to have something to eat?

01:39:22.373 --> 01:39:23.874
Sure.

01:39:27.378 --> 01:39:29.630
Well, this looks great.

01:39:29.714 --> 01:39:31.465
You know, I've been
thinking, Robin,

01:39:31.549 --> 01:39:33.634
maybe we should take a
couple of days off,

01:39:33.718 --> 01:39:35.761
get a boat, go up to
the lake or something.

01:39:35.845 --> 01:39:37.346
What do you think?

01:39:58.368 --> 01:39:59.868
Why did you do that?

01:40:03.164 --> 01:40:04.915
So nobody could get in.

01:40:04.999 --> 01:40:07.918
What's the matter, Robin?

01:40:09.170 --> 01:40:11.004
You know what's the matter.

01:40:11.089 --> 01:40:13.090
No, I don't. What is it?

01:40:16.302 --> 01:40:19.096
It's that goddamn girl!

01:40:19.180 --> 01:40:21.181
What girl?

01:40:22.433 --> 01:40:24.226
The one that's like me.

01:40:24.310 --> 01:40:26.186
What do you mean, "like you"?

01:40:26.270 --> 01:40:28.730
What? You think I don't
know she's around?

01:40:28.815 --> 01:40:30.565
She's right out there.

01:40:32.235 --> 01:40:34.861
- There is no girl.
- That's a lie!

01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:37.864
No, it isn't, Robin.

01:40:37.949 --> 01:40:40.701
She'll do everything
I can do, won't she?

01:40:40.785 --> 01:40:43.453
And you won't miss me at all.

01:40:43.538 --> 01:40:45.205
What are you trying
to say, Robin?

01:40:53.631 --> 01:40:56.800
Company's coming.
Yes, you know that.

01:40:58.469 --> 01:41:01.638
There'll be you... and me...

01:41:03.182 --> 01:41:06.059
and Dr. Ives...

01:41:06.144 --> 01:41:07.644
and Childress.

01:41:10.857 --> 01:41:12.899
And that girl makes five.

01:41:12.984 --> 01:41:16.611
No, only four, Robin.

01:41:16.696 --> 01:41:19.406
You can see that the table
is set just for four.

01:41:23.119 --> 01:41:24.619
That's right.

01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:28.331
I won't be here. I'll be dead.

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:32.169
That girl's taking my place
after you poison me!

01:41:34.630 --> 01:41:37.466
- What's the matter, Susie?
- Oh, God!

01:41:37.550 --> 01:41:39.134
- What's the matter?
- Oh, God!

01:41:39.218 --> 01:41:42.429
Remember? I told you I didn't
have to touch you to hurt you.

01:41:42.513 --> 01:41:44.055
Robin, please, stop!

01:41:44.182 --> 01:41:46.433
Well, I'm hurting you now!
Stop it!

01:41:46.517 --> 01:41:47.976
'Cause I don't
love you anymore!

01:41:48.102 --> 01:41:49.603
I'm tired of you!

01:41:49.687 --> 01:41:53.774
You're killing her! Stop it!

01:41:55.860 --> 01:41:57.819
Sto...

01:41:59.405 --> 01:42:01.948
Stop. He...

01:42:02.033 --> 01:42:05.994
You're... kill... No.

01:42:08.414 --> 01:42:12.542
Susie, get up.

01:42:12.627 --> 01:42:14.461
I said, get up.

01:42:14.545 --> 01:42:17.047
Robin. God, stop.

01:42:17.131 --> 01:42:18.965
I can make you get up.

01:42:23.554 --> 01:42:25.055
Turn around.

01:42:29.393 --> 01:42:30.727
Up.

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.855
R-Robin.

01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:37.317
- Up.
- Oh, God, Robin.

01:42:38.319 --> 01:42:39.319
Up.

01:42:39.403 --> 01:42:43.573
Oh, Rob... Oh, please.

01:42:57.463 --> 01:42:58.505
Turn around.

01:43:02.260 --> 01:43:04.386
Again.

01:43:06.430 --> 01:43:08.557
Faster.

01:43:08.641 --> 01:43:12.352
Faster.

01:43:12.436 --> 01:43:14.688
Faster. Faster.

01:43:14.772 --> 01:43:16.273
Turn.

01:43:16.357 --> 01:43:18.608
Again. Turn.

01:43:19.443 --> 01:43:21.570
Faster. Faster.

01:43:36.919 --> 01:43:38.962
Let's do it.

01:43:40.172 --> 01:43:42.215
Here. Give me your hand.

01:43:45.636 --> 01:43:46.887
Oh, geez!

01:44:02.236 --> 01:44:04.738
Hi, pal.

01:44:04.822 --> 01:44:06.948
Thought I'd drop
by to say hello.

01:44:08.868 --> 01:44:10.994
Long time no see,

01:44:14.832 --> 01:44:16.333
Looking good.

01:44:19.462 --> 01:44:21.922
Too bad, Peter. You
almost made it.

01:44:25.927 --> 01:44:27.510
Where's my son?

01:44:30.431 --> 01:44:31.932
Why don't you give up?

01:44:33.267 --> 01:44:36.311
Why, you...

01:44:41.525 --> 01:44:42.692
- Oh, God!
- Shit!

01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:45.695
No!

01:44:45.821 --> 01:44:46.863
- Stop!
- Hey!

01:44:46.948 --> 01:44:49.032
Stop!

01:45:16.519 --> 01:45:20.397
All right, Peter. You said
you wanted to see your son.

01:45:21.357 --> 01:45:23.149
Go ahead and get him.

01:45:48.259 --> 01:45:51.386
Robin?

01:45:53.014 --> 01:45:54.597
Can you hear me?

01:45:57.727 --> 01:45:59.227
Robin?

01:46:01.856 --> 01:46:04.065
Please answer me.

01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:39.309
Oh, my God.

01:46:49.653 --> 01:46:51.154
Robin!

01:46:58.329 --> 01:47:00.997
Where is he?

01:47:12.301 --> 01:47:14.844
What have they done to you?

01:47:27.024 --> 01:47:28.525
Son?

01:47:30.194 --> 01:47:32.445
I know they told
you I was dead.

01:47:34.031 --> 01:47:35.782
They wanted me out of the way.

01:47:40.121 --> 01:47:42.038
I never gave up.

01:47:43.457 --> 01:47:45.667
I kept looking for
you all the time.

01:47:53.592 --> 01:47:56.719
Come on, Robin. Hey.

01:47:57.972 --> 01:48:00.181
Don't you recognize
your old man?

01:48:03.644 --> 01:48:04.561
Peter!

01:48:06.814 --> 01:48:08.565
No!

01:48:12.361 --> 01:48:13.903
Hang on, Robin.

01:48:26.250 --> 01:48:27.667
Reach up with your other hand.

01:48:29.003 --> 01:48:30.753
Come on.

01:48:33.215 --> 01:48:34.716
Grab ahold of my jacket.

01:48:36.635 --> 01:48:38.386
Climb over me.

01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:40.722
That's it. Come on.

01:48:40.806 --> 01:48:42.182
You can do it.

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:45.435
That's it. That's it.

01:48:58.115 --> 01:48:59.115
No!

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:01.951
Oh, God!

01:49:38.864 --> 01:49:40.365
Robin!

01:49:52.461 --> 01:49:55.964
All right. Get 'em out of here.
Get 'em out of my sight.

01:50:23.492 --> 01:50:24.993
Morning.

01:50:27.162 --> 01:50:31.124
I made some coffee.
Would you like some?

01:50:32.876 --> 01:50:35.044
No?

01:50:35.129 --> 01:50:37.046
It's warmer by the fire.

01:50:38.757 --> 01:50:40.800
How did you sleep?

01:50:40.884 --> 01:50:42.385
Okay?

01:50:47.224 --> 01:50:49.892
I was here most of the night.
I-I guess you don't remember.

01:50:52.855 --> 01:50:54.689
Move a little
closer to the fire.

01:50:57.776 --> 01:51:01.112
I know what you've been going
through these past couple of days.

01:51:02.072 --> 01:51:04.657
I know how exhausted
you must be.

01:51:05.659 --> 01:51:07.827
It'll take more than
one night's sleep.

01:51:09.580 --> 01:51:11.080
I know how I feel.

01:51:14.209 --> 01:51:16.002
Peter was my friend.

01:51:16.086 --> 01:51:19.464
Maybe the best friend
I'll ever have.

01:51:19.548 --> 01:51:21.341
But I had to do what I did.

01:51:21.425 --> 01:51:23.384
You saw what happened.

01:51:24.553 --> 01:51:28.139
Peter could have saved Robin.
Instead, he let him go.

01:51:29.224 --> 01:51:31.392
He deliberately killed his son.

01:51:34.021 --> 01:51:37.065
I hope you don't judge
me too harshly.

01:51:37.149 --> 01:51:40.276
I can't say what I did
was right or wrong.

01:51:41.111 --> 01:51:44.072
I only know I acted,

01:51:44.156 --> 01:51:45.656
and it's done.

01:51:47.451 --> 01:51:48.951
Robin is gone.

01:51:51.121 --> 01:51:53.247
Peter is gone.

01:51:57.127 --> 01:51:59.504
And you're the only
one who matters now.

01:52:02.299 --> 01:52:05.009
Yes, I know that hurts.

01:52:05.094 --> 01:52:07.637
That hurts so bad, you
want to lie down and die,

01:52:07.721 --> 01:52:09.389
but you have to survive.

01:52:11.266 --> 01:52:14.394
You're a healthy,
strong, young girl,

01:52:14.478 --> 01:52:16.729
and you must survive.

01:52:22.486 --> 01:52:27.073
You'll begin by putting all
the tragedies behind you.

01:52:27.157 --> 01:52:29.659
I think that'll be easier
if you accept my help.

01:52:31.703 --> 01:52:35.665
All the bad things you heard
about me just aren't true.

01:52:35.749 --> 01:52:37.417
I'm not a bad man.

01:52:38.919 --> 01:52:41.504
All I want is for
you to trust me.

01:52:42.714 --> 01:52:44.757
Time will take care
of the hurting.

01:52:47.177 --> 01:52:49.137
That's the simple truth.

01:52:51.932 --> 01:52:54.600
Tears are good.

01:52:55.936 --> 01:52:57.645
Don't be afraid of crying.

01:53:00.858 --> 01:53:02.859
Tears are just what
we need right now.

01:53:04.778 --> 01:53:07.572
I'll be a good father
to you, Gillian.

01:53:07.656 --> 01:53:09.740
You can depend on that.

01:53:33.557 --> 01:53:36.601
Gillian!

01:53:50.407 --> 01:53:56.913
Where are you?

01:54:02.419 --> 01:54:04.504
Come on! Come on!

01:54:06.006 --> 01:54:08.508
God!

01:54:21.438 --> 01:54:23.773
You go to hell.

01:54:35.911 --> 01:54:38.371
Oh, God! No! No!
