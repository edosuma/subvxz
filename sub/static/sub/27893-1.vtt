over the princess,

21:18.344 --> 21:20.344
maybe your magic
will work again.

21:20.448 --> 21:22.827
- Yeah, can you Squad Poof us
out of here?

21:22.931 --> 21:24.827
- I don't know,
but I'll give it a shot.

21:24.931 --> 21:26.482
Just pretend we're in danger.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.689
- We are in danger.

21:28.793 --> 21:30.620
- Okay, not helping, Ciara.

Let's hope this works.
